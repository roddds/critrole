00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.991
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome
to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:04.557
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:05.802
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:08.569
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:09.402
LIAM: We play it!

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:10.719
(laughter)

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.602
TRAVIS: Oh no.
MATT: Yeah.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.830
Before we get into tonight's episode,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.050
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.160
beginning with our first of two sponsors,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.100
which is Idle Champions.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.933
Sam.

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.310
LIAM: Idle Champions.
SAM: This episode is

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.380
sponsored by our friends,
Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.450
They're thrilled to introduce

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.110
their brand new interactive live stream experience,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.000
The Unfair Seas, where players will be able to vote

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.960
within the game to make decisions

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.950
impacting a live stream adventure week over week.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.455
They vote-- I think the audience can vote, right?

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:45.020
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: It says the players.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.045
I think-- I don't know,

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:48.510
someone can vote and influence the game.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180
I thought I would borrow that idea

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.060
and let our cast vote on how they'd like to see me perform

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.050
the rest of this advertisement.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.661
MATT: Oh no.
SAM: So you have voting placards.

00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:00.677
TRAVIS: That's what these are.
MATT: Okay.

00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:02.860
SAM: So for the next line of the advertisement,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.380
would the cast like me to read it:

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.500
A: while speaking in a Scottish accent,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.870
B: while clipping clothes pins to my face,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.530
or C: while eating the same yogurt from that drink

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.580
a few weeks ago.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.764
TRAVIS: Ugh, don't anybody
hold up the other one.

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:19.300
SAM: It's a unanimous B.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.977
Okay, okay, okay.
ASHLEY: Nope, nope, nope.

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:21.993
MARISHA: Oh, we're sadistic.

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:23.912
TRAVIS: Ashley--
SAM: Whoa!

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.077
SAM: All right, clothes pins win.

00:01:27.077 --> 00:01:27.910
ASHLEY: Damn it.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.100
SAM: The show features a cast made up of creators

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.093
playing as their champions
available in the game, including--

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.150
LIAM: (laughs)

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.670
SAM: -- B. Dave Walters, Krystina Arielle, Mike Meir,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.360
and Luke Gygax.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.193
Okay.

00:01:43.193 --> 00:01:45.310
TRAVIS: How about your nose.
ASHLEY: Nose, nose, nose, ears.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.410
SAM: Oh, nose is good.
TRAVIS: Ears, yeah.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.796
SAM: Ow, fuck.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:51.970
Okay, for the next line of the advertisement.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.440
cast, please vote.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.330
Shall I read it inhaling, in song,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.888
oh, A: inhaling,

00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:00.671
B: in song,

00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:03.929
or C: in a bag?

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.062
MARISHA: Hmm.

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:08.210
ASHLEY: Wait, inhaling like--?
SAM: I don't know.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.360
TRAVIS: Don't think, Ashley, just hold up a letter.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.028
SAM: Oh, B is in song, okay, so here we go.

SAM: And for the last line, cast,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.010
would you like me to perform it:

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.790
A: with grapes in my mouth,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.600

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:52.350
(plastic gunshot)
TRAVIS: Oh my god, Ashley!

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.515
SAM: Shit! That really hurt!

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.848
TRAVIS: Get the protection on.

00:02:56.848 --> 00:02:58.539
(plastic air compressor revs)

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.465
MATT: Finish it, finish it!

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:02.364
ASHLEY: I'll finish it.
LAURA: No!

00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:04.109
TRAVIS: Do it!

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.500
ASHLEY: I wasn't even looking.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.350
SAM: So jump over to Idle Champions--

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.196
ah!

00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:10.362
ASHLEY: Oh, I ran out of bullets.

00:03:10.362 --> 00:03:12.436
(plastic air compressor revs)

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:13.319
(laughter)

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.119
I have to reload every time?

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.202
SAM: So hop over to Idle Cha--

00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:21.550
TRAVIS: Oh, that got through, that got through!

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.794
That got cheek, you got him on the cheek.

00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:27.002
That was a headshot, okay!
SAM: Head over to idlechampions.com--

00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:29.790
idlechampions.com/criticalrole to get

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.843

LIAM: Are you okay?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.231
SAM: Oh god.
MARISHA: You got--

00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:39.114
SAM: (painful yelping)

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:39.947
MATT: Sam.

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:43.070
SAM: (relieved noises)

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.903
MARISHA: I think you have--

00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:47.150
TRAVIS: You're like Johnny Knoxville.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.290
MATT: Sam.
SAM: That really hurt.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.512
Liam's is very, very powerful, it has a motor in it.

00:03:52.512 --> 00:03:54.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does!
LIAM: That's what they say.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.900
(laughter)

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.567
ASHLEY: How come I had to reload every time?

00:03:57.567 --> 00:03:59.950
MATT: Sam, can we get that URL one more time?

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.666

Thank you, Sam.

00:04:08.902 --> 00:04:11.384
TRAVIS: I thought the one that snuck in under the--

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:12.540
SAM: That was good.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.745
TALIESIN: That was very good.
LAURA: Oh.

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:14.748
MATT: Oh, thank you.

00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:15.750
LIAM: You all should have voted for grapes,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.030
because we would have shot him afterward anyway.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.863
MATT: That's true.

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:19.696
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: That's true.

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:20.930
ASHLEY: Well, I had to get one shot in,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.513
in case you guys decided to vote against--

00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:24.550
SAM: Thank you, Laura.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.140
Thank you.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.880
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you Idle Champions.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.432
I like this format, maybe we'll go with it in the future.

00:04:32.432 --> 00:04:34.870
MARISHA: Oh my god.
LAURA: Poor Sam.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.278
MATT: Our second sponsor tonight is--

00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:37.563
SAM: I wrote the fucking thing.

00:04:37.563 --> 00:04:40.220
MATT: That's true, you only have yourself to blame.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.300

(flames whooshing)

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.050
MATT: And welcome back.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.060
So last we left off:

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.012
The Mighty Nein, having slipped from the Tomb Takers

00:08:22.012 --> 00:08:25.140
and made their way away from Eiselcross,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.730
having bought themselves a bit of time,

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.705
went to convene with some allies and gather information

00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:34.750
and gather things to help them as they hope to return

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.270
more prepared and more ready

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.820
for what dangers may await them to the far north.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.970
After meeting with Yussa, and Kima and Allura,

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.630
you made your way to Rexxentrum,

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.603
checked in and spoke with the Cobalt Soul.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.150
And after a tense engagement

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.330
in the middle of a dance hall

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.670
between Caleb and Astrid,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.210
discovered an extension of the tensions

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.160
here at home, in the Empire,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.240
and interest to perhaps utilize that point of distraction

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.773
as a time to...

00:09:10.365 --> 00:09:14.050
make some long-running plans viable.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.000
After scattering to finish up your shopping

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.070
for the day as well, you set up for the night,

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.200
and left the tower to Yasha and Beauregard

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.363
to finally have their long-delayed date.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.030
And we left off at the end of that evening.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.710
So after a night of-- for some-- discomfort

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.093
in a not-so-great chamber,

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.353
others probably a little more comfortable,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.600
the morning comes to.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.950
You all begin to wake up with

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.320
a variety of cricks in your neck and aches in your back.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.510
But nevertheless, the morning is yours.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.583
So Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

00:09:56.852 --> 00:09:58.370
LIAM: Well, I'm debating how long we wait

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.973
before we go in for breakfast.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.850
TRAVIS: You could just dispel the thing

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.760
and just shoot them out in whatever state

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.593
they're in right now.

00:10:06.593 --> 00:10:08.447
LIAM: I have thought of the very thing, but--

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.220
LAURA: They could be in the middle of stuff right now,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.842
that could be intense.

00:10:14.842 --> 00:10:18.730
LIAM: I wonder how many points of exhaustion it will take--

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.980
TALIESIN: They're probably not in
the breakfast room, though, right?

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.570
Like, we could sneak into a room off to the side

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.830
and just start eating.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.620
LAURA: We could also just open the door and shout

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.953
that we're--
LIAM: That were coming in,

00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:33.600
and the odds of them doing it in the dining hall

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.160
is one in nine.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.977
SAM: Is there a sock on the door or something?

00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:42.940
LIAM: They do know that we're coming in.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.880
SAM: Okay.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.713
Well, let's go.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.493
LIAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah, Veth,

00:10:46.493 --> 00:10:48.240
come on, you lead the way.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.410
Make it loud.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.164
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:10:51.164 --> 00:10:52.455
(screams) Fluffernutter!

00:10:52.455 --> 00:10:57.324
(laughter)
(explosions)

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.473
SAM: (knocks)

00:10:58.473 --> 00:11:01.654
Hello, hi.

00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:03.085
Hello.

00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:07.510
MATT: Now the two of you awaken the following morning,

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.710
in whatever state you wish,

00:11:09.647 --> 00:11:11.803
or however early you wish to have awakened.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.460
What are you two doing?

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.673
MARISHA: Is someone knocking?

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:20.910
ASHLEY: (groaning)
(laughter)

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.890
MARISHA: They're not seriously going to make us go answer

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.068
the fucking door, are they?

00:11:24.068 --> 00:11:25.259
ASHLEY: They can come in.

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:27.660
I don't know if it's unlocked.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.960
MARISHA: Should I just try to yell?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.200
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.570
I'm going to keep my eyes closed.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.956
MARISHA: Come in.

00:11:32.956 --> 00:11:34.316
LAURA: We're coming in.

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:36.740
SAM: Okay, we're coming in.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.310
LIAM: You are so far away from us.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.585
MARISHA: Yeah, there's no way.

00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:41.430
LIAM: (muffled speech)

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.975
TRAVIS: Go on in, I'm sure it's fine.

00:11:43.975 --> 00:11:45.474
SAM: I'm going in.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:11:45.474 --> 00:11:47.007
MATT: All right.

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:48.174
SAM: Crossbow out.

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.530
(laughter)

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.850
MARISHA: There might be an errant ninja, you never know.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:54.683
MATT: That's true.

00:11:54.683 --> 00:11:56.460
LAURA: Send them a message, Caleb.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.980
Let them know to not be naked when we--

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.188
I mean, they can be naked--

00:12:00.188 --> 00:12:03.021
If you want to stay naked, it's okay, but we're coming in.

00:12:03.021 --> 00:12:05.380
LIAM: We are moving from the first floor

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.430
to the second floor.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.263
TRAVIS: Up.

00:12:08.263 --> 00:12:09.850
SAM: Caleb, something's very wrong.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.203
Your cats look different.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.423
LIAM: Yes.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.550
SAM: Something's horrifyingly wrong.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.210
They've been corrupted by magic.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.937
LAURA: Is it a hot tub?

00:12:20.937 --> 00:12:22.340
(gasps)

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.090
Can it stay like this all the time?

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.210
LIAM: Just because you can doesn't mean you should.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.332
LAURA: I run over to the slide and get on the slide.

00:12:33.332 --> 00:12:35.260
(laughter)

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.130
LIAM: Are you doing the curly slippy one,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.350
or the cannonball drop?

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.750
LAURA: Yes!
TRAVIS: Yeah, action park film.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.780
(laughter)

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.703
Looks good.

00:12:43.703 --> 00:12:45.322
LIAM: It slipped in through my subconscious.

00:12:45.322 --> 00:12:47.405
(laughter)

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.653
TRAVIS: I'm sure the water's clear, you can go anytime.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.377
TALIESIN: I mean, life's short, sure.

00:12:56.215 --> 00:12:58.810
MATT: So people start getting in the hot tub.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.310
TALIESIN: There's a water slide.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.726
MATT: All right, yeah. Go for it.

00:13:01.726 --> 00:13:04.400
All right, water, morning, breakfast, water slide.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.700
Go for it.
TALIESIN: Water slide first,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.301
so you don't get the tummy.

00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:09.033
LAURA: (laughs) That's right.

00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:09.866
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: That tummy.

00:13:09.866 --> 00:13:11.265
MATT: Awesome.
LIAM: I'm not swimming,

00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:12.540
I'm going straight for the cat.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.220
And I lay down on one of the mats

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.030
and let massive lion feet go (rumbling)

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.900
into my back.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.070
Take out, oh, you know, just 30 years of tension.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:24.903
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.132
LAURA: And then, you know, breakfast.

00:13:27.132 --> 00:13:28.910
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Later.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.163
SAM: So what's on the docket for the day?

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.730
TALIESIN: Check in, at the very least.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.144
SAM: Check in? What's that mean? With who?

00:13:38.144 --> 00:13:40.060
Oh yes, with Astrid.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.120
LIAM: Right, we're going to, after we eat,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.440
we will leave here, and it's fairly early,

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.885
but hopefully you can reach out and--

00:13:48.885 --> 00:13:51.873
LAURA: (splashing) Yeah, I'll hit her up.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:55.914
(laughter)

00:13:55.914 --> 00:13:57.214
ASHLEY: Hand stand.

00:13:58.882 --> 00:14:01.760
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess we should go.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.360
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, let's go.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.930
I'm hungry.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.023
MARISHA: I got us these awesome matching robes.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.483
ASHLEY: I mean, this is the greatest, even has a hood.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.483
MARISHA: Okay.

00:14:15.483 --> 00:14:17.543
(laughter)

00:14:17.543 --> 00:14:18.497
LIAM: <i>Utinni</i>!

00:14:18.497 --> 00:14:20.580
(laughter)

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.720
ASHLEY: ♪ Good morning! ♪

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.150
SAM: Oh, good morning.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.243
TALIESIN: Wow, didn't see you there.

00:14:27.243 --> 00:14:29.030
ASHLEY: Hello!

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.030
MARISHA: Making use of the hot tub?

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.990
TALIESIN: I mean, it's here.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.670
MARISHA: Isn't it a great idea?

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.010
It should honestly stay like this for forever.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.930
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think this is something

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.312
that probably should stay here forever.

00:14:41.312 --> 00:14:43.400
LAURA: Can it stay, Caleb? Can it stay, can it stay?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.690
LIAM: Well, it technically can be inside that closet,

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.320
or that closet, or that closet,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.513
and come out when you need it.

00:14:50.513 --> 00:14:51.850
Just say, "I want the hot tub,"

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.243
and then you open the doors and then it comes out.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.950
<i>Guten morgen</i>, are you rested?

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.640
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.050
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Gross, gross.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.145
Just say yes like a normal person.

00:15:04.145 --> 00:15:07.310
(laughter)

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.140
ASHLEY: We just stayed up all night talking,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.419
and we got some rest.

00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:14.252
MARISHA: It was great.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.883
Thank you for this, Caleb.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.013
ASHLEY: Thank you, Caleb.

00:15:20.013 --> 00:15:22.380
LIAM: We got a lot of chaos going on at the moment,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.373
so some niceties are nice.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.360
TRAVIS: Do you need to hydrate?

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.610
Here's some orange juice.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.321
MARISHA: Oh yeah, thank you.

00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:35.404
LAURA: (laughs)

00:15:38.278 --> 00:15:41.321
LIAM: Ah, you, Sprigg, come here.

00:15:41.321 --> 00:15:42.540
LAURA: Aw!

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.220
LIAM: I want you to go up and
get waffles and pancakes going,

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.921
and a lot of bacon for Miss Lionett, please.

00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:53.372
MATT: (yips) Goes and runs off.

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:55.220
(laughter)

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.120
LIAM: Let's get a bite to eat

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.098
and then we will tear this shit down.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.551
MATT: All right, breakfast is served rather quickly

00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:06.321
and with gusto.

00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:09.750
It is a delightful meal, but you do eat a bit quickly,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:14.350
because you sense the spell duration is coming to a close.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.730
LIAM: This time, let's just sit here at the table

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:17.960
and let it all go away.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.540
TRAVIS: Ooh, okay.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.044
TALIESIN: This is exciting.

00:16:21.044 --> 00:16:22.263
TRAVIS: Have you done this before?

00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:23.213
LIAM: No.

00:16:23.213 --> 00:16:24.390
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.720
MATT: Actually, no.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.900
Sorry, it was--
LAURA: 24 hours.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.463
MATT: 24 hours, I was thinking of the--

00:16:28.463 --> 00:16:29.296
LIAM: Damn it.

00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:30.820
MATT: I was thinking of the--
LAURA: Dome?

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.310
MATT: The dome, my bad.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.320
TRAVIS: Never mind.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.340
MATT: So you're fine. You're going to
take a relaxing morning in.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.110
Forget I said anything.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.587
LIAM: I dispel the tower while everybody's mid-bite.

00:16:40.587 --> 00:16:41.568
MATT: There you go.

00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:43.768
(laughter)
(tumbling)

00:16:43.768 --> 00:16:44.601
ASHLEY: Ugh!

00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:47.350
MATT: You all come blasting out onto the harsh wooden floor

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.783
of a subpar inn.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.460
LAURA: Are we still wet from the hot tub,

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.835
or does the wetness go away?

00:16:56.835 --> 00:16:58.930
MATT: The water is still there.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:16:59.763
LAURA: Okay.

00:16:59.763 --> 00:17:02.000
MATT: The food you eat is still in your stomach.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.800
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Magic's weird.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.461
LAURA: Just, yeah.
TRAVIS: I like it.

00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:07.177
LAURA: I like it.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.584
TALIESIN: There's hot tubs of mine in my home, too, so--

00:17:11.584 --> 00:17:13.300
LAURA: Really?
TALIESIN: I mean, kind of.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.089
There's a hot spring.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.290
TRAVIS: There's a hot spring at your home?

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.010
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.480
That's-- I'm very serious.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.788
TALIESIN: Hot water and cold water,

00:17:21.788 --> 00:17:23.330
and then a big one that's both.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.430
Yeah, it's got a whole--

00:17:25.483 --> 00:17:27.533
SAM: That's great.
TALIESIN: Though I wouldn't recommend going in that one.

00:17:27.533 --> 00:17:28.410
LIAM: Do they smell a little?

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.220
Sometimes they smell a little farty.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.690
TALIESIN: They do, yeah, absolutely.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.653
Not all of them, but a couple of them.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.120
MARISHA: So speaking of your home,

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.240
are we heading that way or did you think it's okay?

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.890
TALIESIN: I think we're heading that way.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.890
LIAM: All right, well, let's stop beating around the bush.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.440
Could you reach out?

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.750
LAURA: Sure.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.203
I send a message to Astrid.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:56.703
Hello.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.880
TRAVIS: Solid.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.923
LAURA: Have you procured the items?

00:18:04.832 --> 00:18:06.877
If so, meet us--

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.810
LIAM: (heavy sigh)

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.106
LAURA: Hold on!

00:18:15.106 --> 00:18:17.873
LIAM: By the school.
LAURA: By the school.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.860
That's not specific.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.771
LIAM: Yes, it is.

00:18:21.771 --> 00:18:22.604
LAURA: Ugh.

00:18:23.984 --> 00:18:24.817
Um.

00:18:28.085 --> 00:18:28.918
Anyway.

00:18:31.018 --> 00:18:32.784
Don't fuck us over!

00:18:32.784 --> 00:18:37.049
(laughter)

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.303
MATT: Love it.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.325
Astrid responds,

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:48.660
"I will meet you there.

00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:53.950
"A conversation is definitely required."

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.843
That's it.

00:18:56.843 --> 00:18:57.760
LAURA: She says she'll meet us there,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.820
and a conversation is definitely required.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.650
Does that mean she has them or she doesn't,

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.520
what do you think?

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.610
LIAM: That sounds like, column C, neither of those things.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.790
LAURA: What if she's like, I will give them to you

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.870
<i>if</i> you do this thing for me?

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.631
TALIESIN: Or I only could get so many because of something?

00:19:14.631 --> 00:19:18.407
TRAVIS: I'm in love with you,
but don't want to say because--

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.000
SAM: Well, let's go find out.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.540
You definitely put a time in your message to her?

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.660
LAURA: Obviously.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.509
LIAM: Well, we have to go there now.

00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:29.350
(laughter)

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.071
SAM: And wait all day until she shows up.

00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:33.173
LAURA: She's going to head over there.

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.430
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.263
MATT: All right.

00:19:36.263 --> 00:19:38.536
So I take it you head over--
LIAM: Have to, yeah.

00:19:38.536 --> 00:19:39.693
MATT: Head over to the Academy.

00:19:39.693 --> 00:19:41.520
(laughter)

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.240
LIAM: There is an outdoor bench by the dormitories

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.240
that we spent a lot of time on.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.230
So I'm going to gamble,

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.763
and think that she will check there.

00:19:50.763 --> 00:19:53.932
LAURA: I'm going to Disguise Self,

00:19:53.932 --> 00:19:56.250
because I don't want to be seen in this city.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.758
MATT: Okay.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.133
As?

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.053
Okay, yeah, you're-- okay, got it.

00:20:03.053 --> 00:20:04.160
(laughter)

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.070
SAM: Dancing Queen?

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.880
ASHLEY: Dancing!

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.810
MATT: All right.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:08.890
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.700
MATT: All right, those who can disguise,

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.900
I assume do so, then.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.733
Similar forms?

00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:17.250
LIAM: Actually, I will cast-- what is it?

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.930
Seeming, and everyone except for Jester

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.930
is now wearing very serious brown robes,

00:20:27.355 --> 00:20:28.963
wizardly robes.

00:20:28.963 --> 00:20:31.107
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:20:31.107 --> 00:20:32.230
MATT: (laughs)

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.593
SAM: Wizard, cool.

00:20:34.593 --> 00:20:37.043
MATT: All right, the cloud cover's

00:20:37.043 --> 00:20:38.062
a little broken this morning.

00:20:38.062 --> 00:20:40.340
Little bits of blue peek through,

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.820
a welcome warmth to the Rexxentrum atmosphere.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.050
As you approach the academy grounds,

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.303
and follow Caleb over the bench that he specified,

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.760
this early in the morning, not too bustling.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.590
Looks like everyone who's here

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.683
is either currently in study or elsewhere,

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.450
but you wait for about 30, 40 minutes or so

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.563
before you can see Astrid begin to approach.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.360
Similar overcoat and hood,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.020
but outfit beneath is a little different, new day.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.130
SAM: Alone?

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.103
MATT: Alone.
SAM: Okay.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.593
MATT: Approaches and sits on the bench next to you.

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:24.227
LIAM: Good morning.

00:21:24.227 --> 00:21:25.060
MATT: "Morning.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.223
"So, I've done my research for the night.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.110
"And I have uncovered where the bulk

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:38.023
"of the Volstrucker collection of unused veilers are.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:45.330
"They are however, currently kept in a small vault

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.240
"under the northwest tower on the grounds

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.640
"of the Vergesson Sanatorium."

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.460
TRAVIS: Sorry, Astrid, what was the name of that place?

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.443
MATT: The Vergesson--
LIAM: Vergesson.

00:21:55.443 --> 00:21:57.126
SAM: It's where he was kept?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:21:57.126 --> 00:21:58.260
TRAVIS: I know that place.
MATT: You've been there once.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.368
You guys went there once.

00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:00.938
TRAVIS: Making sure Sam could hear.
MATT: Yeah.

00:22:00.938 --> 00:22:03.080
LAURA: Did you say it was the what corner?

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.180
MATT: It was--
SAM: Northwest.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.302
MATT: Within a small vault under the northwest tower

00:22:07.302 --> 00:22:08.648
on the grounds.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.650
LIAM: Northwest tower.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.545
LAURA: Okay. I like how we all write it down, but yeah.

00:22:15.545 --> 00:22:16.797
TRAVIS: I'm not, I'm drawing.

00:22:16.797 --> 00:22:19.130
LAURA: (laughs)

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.090
MATT: As she says this, you see

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.950
she casually leaves on the bench next to her

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.820
this small wooden case.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.123
Just puts her arm over it for the time being.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.300
"I, unfortunately lack the knowledge

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.763
"of the teleportation rune that is anchored there.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.770
"Master Ikithon tends to keep that under his control,

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.730
"and I also lack the means of breaking into the vault.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.913
"My presence there unattended by Trent

00:22:49.913 --> 00:22:51.571
"would probably raise suspicion,

00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:55.218
"otherwise I would go myself."

00:22:55.218 --> 00:22:57.718
LIAM: Do you have any idea where the old man is today?

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:00.323
MATT: "Today?

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.490
"I saw him this morning,

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.303
"but who knows how long he is to remain.

00:23:08.953 --> 00:23:11.116
"I do not keep his day to day."

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.372
LIAM: Do I believe her?

00:23:14.372 --> 00:23:15.705
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.350
LIAM: 15.
MATT: 15.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.360
She seems on level, much as you can tell.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.540
Though she's not talking directly to you;

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.700
she's talking facing away,

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.270
and occasionally making eye contact,

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.260
but keeping it like a casual side conversation

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.038
out of the sight of anyone

00:23:37.038 --> 00:23:39.386
who might be peering unexpectedly.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.059
LIAM: What about Wulf, is he in town?

00:23:43.059 --> 00:23:46.940
MATT: "He is currently out on a mission, but I believe

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.540
"he is expected to return in the next couple of days."

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.123
LIAM: Okay. That is much appreciated.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.750
SAM: Can I just do a scan of the courtyard,

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.850
see if anyone's watching us?

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.200
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.860
SAM: I'm really good at these.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.910
Yeah, 13.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.097
MATT: 13, it looks fairly solid.

00:24:11.814 --> 00:24:13.700
Couple of ne'er do wells in brown robes,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.510
but you recognize them.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.560
LIAM: Is there any cost for this information?

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.453
MATT: "No cost.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.743
"Consider it

00:24:26.476 --> 00:24:28.801
"a meager start to an apology."

00:24:38.318 --> 00:24:43.235
LIAM: Well, as I said, this is appreciated, and

00:24:46.743 --> 00:24:49.730
if we can pull it out of the fire,

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.080
it will stand to be of good use for all of this.

00:24:58.233 --> 00:25:01.573
MATT: "I would recommend, while the sun is out.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.960
"At night, more often than not, is when Trent--

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.785
"when he's to attend the Sanatorium,

00:25:11.785 --> 00:25:13.680
"that would be when."

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.680
LIAM: I watch a couple of teenagers strolling by

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.910
the school grounds, and watch them and say:

00:25:23.017 --> 00:25:25.200
What will you be occupying yourself with

00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:27.567
for the coming week or so?

00:25:28.804 --> 00:25:33.800
MATT: "Well, when Wulf returns, we have to check in

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.560
"and see what the next necessary thing is for us to do.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.393
"And if there is none, then...

00:25:44.246 --> 00:25:47.054
"whatever I wish to use to entertain myself.

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:52.290
LIAM: Well, I hope to report back to you

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.760
at the end of the day with some good news.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.593
MATT: "I hope so, too.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.650
"These are not easy to procure.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.210
"And for the number that you need,

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.360
"this is your best bet of what I could find.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.773
"Just be careful.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.170
"Do not raise a fuss.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:16.370
"Best in and out quickly."

00:26:19.234 --> 00:26:21.723
She taps the little box and says,

00:26:24.007 --> 00:26:26.220
"The rest will be self-explanatory,"

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.650
and she sits up and begins to make her way,

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.950
taking a few steps before stopping,

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.697
looking over her shoulder, and--

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.527
and just continues walking.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.550
LIAM: Does the box immediately-- I'm sure it doesn't,

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:53.550
but does it appear dangerous in any way?

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.850
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:26:58.622 --> 00:26:59.455
LIAM: 15.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.330
MATT: It appears to be a wooden box,

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.373
roughly about that big,

00:27:04.373 --> 00:27:07.100
about two inches tall. It has a little metal latch

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.053
on one side.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.650
It does not look particularly detailed,

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.713
or crafted with an insidious lock.

00:27:19.547 --> 00:27:23.390
LIAM: I look around and see if there's anybody close

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.740
who's not a friend of mine,

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:30.232
and if there isn't, I will cast Detect Magic over it.

00:27:30.232 --> 00:27:32.258
MATT: Okay, nothing magical.

00:27:34.497 --> 00:27:35.748
LIAM: Fuck it.

00:27:35.748 --> 00:27:36.581
(creaks)

00:27:36.581 --> 00:27:37.831
TRAVIS: (explosion)

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.090
SAM: Campaign three.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:40.923
MATT: Yeah.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:45.260
There is a handful of pieces of paper

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.410
that are just folded.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:47.610
You're uncertain what's on them.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.660
You just see them resting inside the box.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:56.257
LIAM: Okay, I will just pick them up

00:27:56.257 --> 00:27:58.330
and pocket them for the moment.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.880
MATT: Okay.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.780
LIAM: And stand, and not look at anybody,

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.728
but begin walking out of the campus.

00:28:08.728 --> 00:28:09.561
MATT: Okay.

00:28:09.914 --> 00:28:11.792
LAURA: What do you do with the box? Just leave it there?

00:28:11.792 --> 00:28:13.375
LIAM: No.
LAURA: Okay.

00:28:17.134 --> 00:28:18.321
MATT: The rest of you?

00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:20.454
SAM: Caleb's leaving, I guess we should go.

00:28:20.454 --> 00:28:21.367
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:23.294
TALIESIN: I'll follow at a reasonable distance.

00:28:23.294 --> 00:28:24.127
MATT: Okay.

00:28:24.127 --> 00:28:26.234
MARISHA: I'll split off and swing wide.

00:28:26.234 --> 00:28:27.484
MATT: Okay.

00:28:27.484 --> 00:28:32.484
You all scatter and snake back around to rejoin--

00:28:32.492 --> 00:28:33.832
(laughter)

00:28:33.832 --> 00:28:35.974
LAURA: It's my walk down the street.

00:28:35.974 --> 00:28:36.874
SAM: Oh, in character?

00:28:36.874 --> 00:28:38.266
LAURA: Yeah.

00:28:38.266 --> 00:28:39.582
SAM: (Mid-Atlantic accent) Hello.
LAURA: (Mid-Atlantic accent) Hey.

00:28:39.582 --> 00:28:41.020
SAM: Hey.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.992
Good morning to y'all.

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:43.966
LAURA: Nice robes!

00:28:43.966 --> 00:28:45.408
MARISHA: Just always partying.

00:28:45.408 --> 00:28:48.415
MATT: It's like young
Barbra Streisand on mushrooms

00:28:48.415 --> 00:28:50.673
just wandering through Rexxentrum.

00:28:50.673 --> 00:28:52.014
SAM: Constant Minnelli.

00:28:52.014 --> 00:28:53.472
(laughter)

00:28:53.472 --> 00:28:56.254
MARISHA: Constant Minnelli. (laughs)

00:28:56.254 --> 00:28:57.451
MATT: That's good band name.

00:28:57.451 --> 00:28:59.244
MARISHA: Yeah, it is.

00:28:59.244 --> 00:29:00.308
Yeah, right, Constance Minnelli.

00:29:00.308 --> 00:29:01.512
MATT: Where do you reconvene?

00:29:03.454 --> 00:29:07.154
LIAM: I will just slow like a couple blocks away,

00:29:07.154 --> 00:29:08.262
and let them catch up.

00:29:08.262 --> 00:29:09.870
MATT: All right. You all eventually gather up

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.034
and find Caleb a little bit tucked away

00:29:13.034 --> 00:29:15.544
from the main thoroughfare.

00:29:15.544 --> 00:29:18.504
LIAM: So she did not have them,

00:29:18.504 --> 00:29:21.784
but she has set a place for us to go.

00:29:21.784 --> 00:29:23.594
LAURA: What's in the box?

00:29:23.594 --> 00:29:25.056
LIAM: Some paper, papers.

00:29:25.056 --> 00:29:27.154
I'll pull them back out and unfold them,

00:29:27.154 --> 00:29:29.404
and see what I'm looking at, now that we're away.

00:29:29.404 --> 00:29:32.587
MATT: There three pieces of paper of different material,

00:29:34.104 --> 00:29:37.301
with hand-drawn floor plans.

00:29:37.301 --> 00:29:38.134
SAM: Ooh.

00:29:41.264 --> 00:29:44.639
MATT: One of which you can see

00:29:45.822 --> 00:29:47.488
resembles the--

00:29:47.488 --> 00:29:49.935
SAM: Ooh, map cam!
LAURA: Ooh!

00:29:49.935 --> 00:29:53.002
MATT: A base floor of some kind.

00:29:53.002 --> 00:29:56.302
MARISHA: (coughs) Sorry.
MATT: And you've--

00:29:57.404 --> 00:30:00.195
MATT: Make an intelligence check, Caleb.

00:30:01.907 --> 00:30:04.004
TRAVIS: It's [inaudible].

00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:05.434
LIAM: Just nine plus my modifier, right?

00:30:05.434 --> 00:30:06.404
MATT: Yep.
LIAM: 14.

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:07.237
MATT: Okay.

00:30:09.014 --> 00:30:10.824
She said northwest tower.

00:30:10.824 --> 00:30:14.034
You recall, though you didn't spend a lot of time

00:30:14.034 --> 00:30:18.974
on the surface of the sanatorium as you fled rather quickly.

00:30:18.974 --> 00:30:23.674
You do have a pretty airtight memory, though.

00:30:23.674 --> 00:30:26.254
And you piece together the tower in question,

00:30:26.254 --> 00:30:29.784
and the floor plan here is to be probably one in the same.

00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:33.294
You also can see there are a number, there's two entrances,

00:30:33.294 --> 00:30:36.204
and what you gather to be a descending staircase

00:30:36.204 --> 00:30:37.794
in the central chamber.

00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:39.314
LIAM: So that's ground level.

00:30:39.314 --> 00:30:40.774
MATT: Correct.

00:30:40.774 --> 00:30:44.692
LIAM: Door on the tower, door on the wall at the front.

00:30:44.692 --> 00:30:45.874
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:30:45.874 --> 00:30:46.707
LIAM: Okay.

00:30:47.974 --> 00:30:52.957
MATT: You also see a subterranean basement level

00:30:55.174 --> 00:30:57.814
and there are a little red glyphs drawn on the ground.

00:30:57.814 --> 00:31:01.654
And there is a little note left that Astrid has handwritten,

00:31:01.654 --> 00:31:06.077
that says in very, very quick shorthand:

00:31:07.554 --> 00:31:11.084
"In my times accompanied by Trent, there were wards

00:31:11.084 --> 00:31:15.467
"that he would temporarily absolve

00:31:15.467 --> 00:31:17.233
"in passing through.

00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:19.114
"I have marked the ones I could recall."

00:31:21.934 --> 00:31:23.257
LIAM: The ones-- okay.

00:31:24.194 --> 00:31:25.994
TRAVIS: Right, we'll need to dispel those.

00:31:26.874 --> 00:31:31.474
SAM: Caleb, when you studied in school together,

00:31:31.474 --> 00:31:33.989
did you guys take, like, a drafting class?

00:31:33.989 --> 00:31:36.904
Because, like, this is phenomenal work.

00:31:36.904 --> 00:31:38.684
Like, she must've sat up all night

00:31:38.684 --> 00:31:40.261
with, like, rulers, and--

00:31:40.261 --> 00:31:42.414
LIAM: She is nothing if not thorough.

00:31:42.414 --> 00:31:44.184
SAM: Amazing.
LIAM: Trust me.

00:31:44.184 --> 00:31:47.870
ASHLEY: Why the different types of paper?

00:31:48.894 --> 00:31:51.854
Is that for any reason, but just for funsies?

00:31:51.854 --> 00:31:53.044
TRAVIS: Veth, you have chemicals.

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:56.024
Perhaps we should test the parchment itself.

00:31:56.024 --> 00:31:57.121
It could be a clue.

00:31:57.121 --> 00:31:59.803
MARISHA: Yeah, a secret message written in invisible ink.

00:31:59.803 --> 00:32:01.453
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:01.453 --> 00:32:03.404
SAM: Most of my chemicals were in the bag that was stolen,

00:32:03.404 --> 00:32:05.654
but I have a few left over.

00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:08.323
MARISHA: Yeah?
SAM: (hocks spit)

00:32:08.323 --> 00:32:09.944
(laughter)

00:32:09.944 --> 00:32:11.194
LIAM: By the way--
SAM: I have to pee.

00:32:11.194 --> 00:32:13.560
LIAM: Everyone but Jester looks like themself again,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.484
because I'm a goober and I dispelled Seeming

00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:17.317
when I cast the Detect Magic.

00:32:17.317 --> 00:32:18.204
MATT: There you go.

00:32:18.204 --> 00:32:20.369
TALIESIN: I'm still weird, too.
MATT: Yeah.

00:32:20.369 --> 00:32:24.051
SAM: I don't know if I have my chemistry kit anymore.

00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:25.117
ASHLEY: It means something, I know it.

00:32:25.117 --> 00:32:26.321
MATT: You wouldn't have it on you,

00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:27.204
it would have been in the bag of holding,

00:32:27.204 --> 00:32:28.104
so you'd have to pick up a new one.

00:32:28.104 --> 00:32:30.924
SAM: I'll just hold it up to the sun a little bit.

00:32:30.924 --> 00:32:31.834
MATT: Okay, make a perception check,

00:32:31.834 --> 00:32:33.099
or investigation for this one.

00:32:33.099 --> 00:32:34.164
This would be investigation.

00:32:34.164 --> 00:32:36.174
SAM: Investigation, 23.

00:32:36.174 --> 00:32:37.474
MATT: And you are looking for?

00:32:38.534 --> 00:32:42.804
SAM: Hidden messages, secret glyphs,

00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:46.453
some watermark that we might have missed the first perusal.

00:32:46.453 --> 00:32:48.292
MATT: Fair enough.

00:32:48.292 --> 00:32:50.644
You peer deeply

00:32:50.644 --> 00:32:51.757
into this paper,

00:32:53.334 --> 00:32:55.424
and confidently,

00:32:55.424 --> 00:32:57.224
you discover

00:32:57.224 --> 00:33:00.082
that it is just paper scrawled upon.

00:33:00.082 --> 00:33:01.984
But she does have great, you know--

00:33:01.984 --> 00:33:03.926
TRAVIS: Drafting.
MATT: -- great drafting skills.

00:33:03.926 --> 00:33:07.004
Thanks to Dungeon Scrawl, which, shout-out to them,

00:33:07.004 --> 00:33:09.324
a great website that I've recently discovered

00:33:09.324 --> 00:33:10.684
that makes shit like this super easy

00:33:10.684 --> 00:33:11.517
than drawing it by hand.

00:33:11.517 --> 00:33:13.161
So that's why it looks really good.

00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:14.419
SAM: It does look really good.

00:33:14.419 --> 00:33:16.554
MATT: And then the final smaller piece--
LIAM: No, no, it's Astrid.

00:33:16.554 --> 00:33:17.484
MATT: -- is right here.

00:33:17.484 --> 00:33:19.334
SAM: What's that, where's that?
Is that on the top of the tower?

00:33:19.334 --> 00:33:21.008
What is that?
LIAM: That's the bottom.

00:33:21.008 --> 00:33:22.374
LAURA: Oh, the X marks the spot.

00:33:22.374 --> 00:33:23.604
MARISHA: That is like a secret,

00:33:23.604 --> 00:33:25.269
you can only access it through the glyph?

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:26.734
Is that what I'm seeing?

00:33:26.734 --> 00:33:28.974
LIAM: Well, it looks like--
SAM: Oh, could be those stairs.

00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:31.514
LIAM: We see places that are clearly guarded,

00:33:31.514 --> 00:33:35.124
but those are the only ones that have been marked.

00:33:35.124 --> 00:33:39.028
She's indicating that there are potentially more.

00:33:39.028 --> 00:33:39.903
LAURA: Okay.

00:33:41.074 --> 00:33:41.907
LIAM: So.

00:33:42.924 --> 00:33:45.244
LAURA: So where's-- can we see the bottom level?

00:33:45.244 --> 00:33:48.644
I mean, the top. You know what I mean.

00:33:48.644 --> 00:33:49.584
Thanks, Caleb.

00:33:49.584 --> 00:33:51.704
ASHLEY: Okay, so that's the--

00:33:51.704 --> 00:33:53.057
LIAM: I have such smooth hands.

00:33:54.906 --> 00:33:56.567
LAURA: So where would we break into?

00:33:59.104 --> 00:34:03.844
LIAM: Well, the sanatorium is full of fully trained

00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:07.393
agents for Trent.

00:34:08.294 --> 00:34:11.187
When I left eight years ago,

00:34:12.564 --> 00:34:16.622
I had to murder a man to get by.

00:34:22.014 --> 00:34:24.092
This is very difficult.

00:34:27.594 --> 00:34:31.834
I mean, it is almost assuredly

00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:33.829
going to go pear-shaped on us.

00:34:34.664 --> 00:34:37.814
TRAVIS: From what you can see, is this a subterranean area,

00:34:37.814 --> 00:34:39.774
or would this be underneath the tower,

00:34:39.774 --> 00:34:41.794
but near the top?

00:34:41.794 --> 00:34:42.894
LIAM: Down below.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:47.194
I guess we're not going invisible and flying.

00:34:47.194 --> 00:34:49.210
SAM: We could send-- I mean--

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.776
As much as I hate splitting us up,

00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:53.054
we could send in a smaller force

00:34:53.054 --> 00:34:56.224
of nimbly-moving folks to do this.

00:34:56.224 --> 00:34:57.794
MARISHA: I was going to suggest the same thing.

00:34:57.794 --> 00:34:59.144
I think we should have teams,

00:34:59.144 --> 00:35:02.214
like a lookout team, and a break-and-enter team.

00:35:02.214 --> 00:35:04.194
LIAM: And whatever we do, it should be done quickly,

00:35:04.194 --> 00:35:07.544
because when things do go wrong,

00:35:07.544 --> 00:35:10.624
the place is going to be descended upon.

00:35:10.624 --> 00:35:11.457
LAURA: Yeah.

00:35:11.457 --> 00:35:13.127
MARISHA: Dungeon Master.
MATT: Mm-hmm?

00:35:13.127 --> 00:35:17.364
MARISHA: What do we remember from
when we went to the sanatorium

00:35:17.364 --> 00:35:19.024
when we were looking at the beacon?

00:35:19.024 --> 00:35:20.040
Do we remember a lot of--

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.162
LIAM: We went downstairs, if I recall.

00:35:21.162 --> 00:35:22.534
MARISHA: We went downstairs, like, it--

00:35:22.534 --> 00:35:25.134
MATT: You did, you were at one of the other buildings

00:35:25.134 --> 00:35:25.967
when you were brought there.

00:35:25.967 --> 00:35:27.694
There is a central sanatorium structure,

00:35:27.694 --> 00:35:29.987
which is the massive central,

00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:33.854
it looks like a monstrous mansion.

00:35:33.854 --> 00:35:36.504
There are two smaller mansion-like abodes on the premises.

00:35:36.504 --> 00:35:40.164
There is also, what is it like,

00:35:40.164 --> 00:35:41.754
like the smaller quaint structures.

00:35:41.754 --> 00:35:44.774
There's a general use stone building and tower,

00:35:44.774 --> 00:35:47.014
which you vaguely saw in the distance,

00:35:47.014 --> 00:35:48.944
which matches this description here.

00:35:48.944 --> 00:35:53.744
As well as a really elaborate, extravagant tower

00:35:53.744 --> 00:35:56.152
on the north, northeastern side of the premises.

00:35:56.152 --> 00:35:57.304
MARISHA: I see.
MATT: That you know

00:35:57.304 --> 00:35:59.424
to be Tent's specific abodes.

00:35:59.424 --> 00:36:02.074
MARISHA: So she's suggesting that this is in

00:36:02.074 --> 00:36:05.834
the small, outskirts tower

00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:07.274
that's off of the main building?

00:36:07.274 --> 00:36:08.107
MATT: Correct.

00:36:09.779 --> 00:36:11.186
MARISHA: And what do we remember in terms of

00:36:11.186 --> 00:36:13.594
how heavily guarded it was?

00:36:13.594 --> 00:36:15.282
MATT: The courtyard area of this, I mean,

00:36:15.282 --> 00:36:18.294
it has a high iron fence all around the exterior of the area

00:36:18.294 --> 00:36:19.900
where it's cleared in the center of the forest

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.159
at the base of the mountain.

00:36:22.664 --> 00:36:26.774
You recall probably seeing anywhere from six to eight guards

00:36:26.774 --> 00:36:31.224
patrolling the courtyard, which is a fair amount,

00:36:31.224 --> 00:36:34.394
but it's also a place that's largely off the map,

00:36:34.394 --> 00:36:37.544
and there isn't a, like, a heavy guard there

00:36:37.544 --> 00:36:40.134
at any given point in time externally.

00:36:40.134 --> 00:36:42.334
When you went inside the one building you did go into,

00:36:42.334 --> 00:36:45.624
which is not this building, you encountered maybe three,

00:36:45.624 --> 00:36:48.814
four additional guards between different chambers and rooms,

00:36:48.814 --> 00:36:49.794
but they were also expecting

00:36:49.794 --> 00:36:53.734
the arrival of members of the Assembly.

00:36:53.734 --> 00:36:57.744
SAM: And from what I recall, it's not like it's a prison.

00:36:57.744 --> 00:37:02.744
It's part of it is used to hold dangerous people in,

00:37:03.234 --> 00:37:05.525
but not the whole--
MATT: Roll a history check for me.

00:37:06.974 --> 00:37:08.664
SAM: History?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:37:08.664 --> 00:37:10.464
SAM: Eight.
MATT: Eight, okay.

00:37:10.464 --> 00:37:13.124
What you recall is that, yeah,

00:37:13.124 --> 00:37:18.057
it was designed, publicly,

00:37:18.057 --> 00:37:21.265
to help people who either are

00:37:21.265 --> 00:37:26.209
undergoing challenges emotionally, mentally,

00:37:26.209 --> 00:37:27.042
undergoing challenges emotionally, mentally,

00:37:28.104 --> 00:37:31.284
and they have varying degrees of comfort

00:37:31.284 --> 00:37:33.044
compared to the wealth of those

00:37:33.044 --> 00:37:37.194
that are being placed there for recovery.

00:37:37.194 --> 00:37:38.256
So, yeah.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.994
SAM: And then when we were there, I think Caleb pointed out

00:37:39.994 --> 00:37:43.174
the place that he was held was a specific place.

00:37:43.174 --> 00:37:44.249
MATT: Correct.

00:37:44.249 --> 00:37:47.734
SAM: Like a place within the place.

00:37:47.734 --> 00:37:51.592
MATT: Yes, you had told them a little bit about that

00:37:51.592 --> 00:37:55.300
beyond the surface level aid that is kept there,

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.824
there are more dubious practices happening

00:37:58.824 --> 00:38:02.204
behind closed doors, and beneath some of the structures.

00:38:02.204 --> 00:38:06.987
LIAM: It's a little bit of a front
for Trent's activities, yeah?

00:38:06.987 --> 00:38:08.484
MATT: Yeah, I mean--
LIAM: Or it's known as a place that--

00:38:08.484 --> 00:38:11.034
MATT: It's known as a place, and it does serve this purpose,

00:38:11.034 --> 00:38:14.484
but Trent also uses it to cover

00:38:14.484 --> 00:38:15.714
for some of his own practices.

00:38:15.714 --> 00:38:17.664
LIAM: And has different levels of activity,

00:38:18.584 --> 00:38:21.204
as far as number of people, Trent, others there,

00:38:21.204 --> 00:38:23.464
there's always people on guard, to an extent.

00:38:23.464 --> 00:38:25.714
And then there's moments like the one where we went,

00:38:25.714 --> 00:38:27.924
where they knew we were going to be there,

00:38:27.924 --> 00:38:29.444
they knew they were going to be there.

00:38:29.444 --> 00:38:31.044
So there was a heavier presence.

00:38:32.024 --> 00:38:35.184
If Astrid is being level with us,

00:38:35.184 --> 00:38:37.507
then there is somewhat less of a presence.

00:38:38.564 --> 00:38:40.414
SAM: Should we go scout it out?

00:38:40.414 --> 00:38:41.794
Or make our way there?

00:38:41.794 --> 00:38:44.874
LIAM: Yeah, it's outside the city a ways.

00:38:44.874 --> 00:38:46.744
SAM: Like, horseback ways,

00:38:46.744 --> 00:38:48.547
or just walk for a couple of hours ways?

00:38:48.547 --> 00:38:50.816
LIAM: What would I remember, DM?

00:38:50.816 --> 00:38:53.154
MATT: It's a little bit of a jaunt.

00:38:53.154 --> 00:38:58.074
I should go look that up real fast. (laughs)

00:38:58.074 --> 00:39:03.074
SAM: While you do,
do you think this is a

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.649
super covert, stealth, snatch-and-leave?

00:39:05.649 --> 00:39:10.354
Or is it a let's have one group create a diversion,

00:39:10.354 --> 00:39:14.383
and bust out someone, and make a ruckus sort of a thing?

00:39:14.383 --> 00:39:15.454
LAURA: Ooh.

00:39:15.454 --> 00:39:16.951
LIAM: That's a good idea.

00:39:16.951 --> 00:39:17.784
LAURA: This is a good idea.

00:39:17.784 --> 00:39:19.864
TRAVIS: You mean like bust out someone?

00:39:19.864 --> 00:39:23.724
That seems like we're committing two really big crimes.

00:39:23.724 --> 00:39:25.614
Are you thinking setting something on fire and screaming.

00:39:25.614 --> 00:39:27.574
SAM: Sure, that's fine too, or.

00:39:27.574 --> 00:39:31.774
LIAM: I think maybe a smaller unit outside

00:39:31.774 --> 00:39:33.304
making some kind of mayhem.

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.894
MATT: It is quite a bit of travel

00:39:34.894 --> 00:39:38.544
through the heavily wooded Pearlbow Wilderness to get there.

00:39:38.544 --> 00:39:40.024
LAURA: Like, how long of a?

00:39:40.024 --> 00:39:44.203
MATT: Like a number of days' travel on foot.

00:39:44.203 --> 00:39:45.664
SAM: Oh god.
MATT: Yeah.

00:39:45.664 --> 00:39:48.797
LAURA: Oh, but you, oh, but you could teleport us there.

00:39:48.797 --> 00:39:50.754
LIAM: Yes, but that means that we are--

00:39:50.754 --> 00:39:52.404
again, everything slows us a bit.

00:39:54.394 --> 00:39:57.027
But what we gain is great.

00:39:57.027 --> 00:39:58.861
SAM: We can't take days to get there.
LIAM: No.

00:39:58.861 --> 00:40:01.852
TALIESIN: If we fly and then teleport out.

00:40:04.454 --> 00:40:06.454
MARISHA: How long of a flight would it be?

00:40:06.454 --> 00:40:09.167
MATT: That depends on how many times you can Polymorph.

00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:14.167
LAURA: It also probably, it wouldn't save us enough time

00:40:14.214 --> 00:40:17.784
to Polymorph, we'd have to use all of our spells

00:40:17.784 --> 00:40:19.264
just to get there, you know what I mean?

00:40:19.264 --> 00:40:20.494
Then we wouldn't have them on the inside.

00:40:20.494 --> 00:40:22.884
Plus, there's probably some sort of magic effect

00:40:22.884 --> 00:40:25.584
inside the sanatorium so you can't teleport out.

00:40:25.584 --> 00:40:27.134
Otherwise all the wizards being held there

00:40:27.134 --> 00:40:28.964
would just do the same thing.
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a very fair point.

00:40:28.964 --> 00:40:32.664
LIAM: My thought is that we want to go in fully prepared.

00:40:32.664 --> 00:40:33.497
LAURA: Right.

00:40:35.634 --> 00:40:38.104
I think we have to teleport there.

00:40:38.104 --> 00:40:39.894
MARISHA: Is it a teleport and scout for the day,

00:40:39.894 --> 00:40:41.694
and then do this tomorrow?

00:40:41.694 --> 00:40:44.514
Or do we want to try and do this today?

00:40:44.514 --> 00:40:46.197
LIAM: Today.

00:40:46.197 --> 00:40:47.713
TALIESIN: Or a late night thing.

00:40:47.713 --> 00:40:49.304
LIAM: There's always the option that-- hmm.

00:40:52.844 --> 00:40:55.344
If we can get out of the building,

00:40:55.344 --> 00:40:58.494
maybe you and I can use our ability

00:40:58.494 --> 00:41:00.347
to get us to Xhorhas at least.

00:41:04.804 --> 00:41:06.667
TALIESIN: Maybe.
LAURA: Afterwards.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.569
TALIESIN: Is there any reason why that wouldn't work?

00:41:12.569 --> 00:41:15.824
LIAM: Xhorhas, do you mean Nicodranas? Isn't your?

00:41:15.824 --> 00:41:18.104
LAURA: Xhorhas is where our Word of Recall is.

00:41:18.104 --> 00:41:19.028
MATT: Correct.

00:41:19.028 --> 00:41:20.210
LIAM: I thought one of you had done Nicodranas.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.307
Okay, I just remembered wrong.

00:41:21.307 --> 00:41:22.464
LAURA: Oh, wait.
SAM: I thought we did Nicodranas.

00:41:22.464 --> 00:41:24.134
LAURA: We did do Nicodranas, didn't we?

00:41:24.134 --> 00:41:25.370
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: We did.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.560
LIAM: One at the lighthouse.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.365
LAURA: Oh, because I had done mine originally in Xhorhas.

00:41:29.365 --> 00:41:30.198
MARISHA: In Xhorhas, yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

00:41:30.198 --> 00:41:31.204
LAURA: And then we shifted.

00:41:31.204 --> 00:41:33.554
Oh sweet, so it'd be Nicodranas, even better.

00:41:35.464 --> 00:41:38.594
TALIESIN: Yeah, you have to make a like a lodestone for it.

00:41:38.594 --> 00:41:40.644
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we did it, we did it.

00:41:41.741 --> 00:41:43.480
SAM: Let's go, let's go.

00:41:45.184 --> 00:41:46.754
TALIESIN: I do have that spell up.

00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:47.587
LAURA: Me too.

00:41:49.284 --> 00:41:52.104
LIAM: I want to take, use this discussion time,

00:41:52.104 --> 00:41:54.504
and take the equivalent of a short rest

00:41:54.504 --> 00:41:58.284
to pull back a spell slot used already.

00:41:58.284 --> 00:41:59.509
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Because I want to have it.

00:41:59.509 --> 00:42:01.334
MARISHA: Because, yeah, Seeming's like 5th-level, isn't it?

00:42:01.334 --> 00:42:02.167
LIAM: Yeah.

00:42:04.704 --> 00:42:05.537
SAM: While they're resting,

00:42:05.537 --> 00:42:07.534
I'll just go pick up my antlers from the store.

00:42:07.534 --> 00:42:09.768
MATT: Okay, they are indeed ready,

00:42:09.768 --> 00:42:11.518
and at your disposal.

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:13.229
LIAM: Okay.

00:42:18.404 --> 00:42:21.579
May I borrow the medallion again, please?

00:42:21.579 --> 00:42:22.412
LAURA: Of course.

00:42:24.464 --> 00:42:26.197
LIAM: I will use it to cast the spell.

00:42:27.834 --> 00:42:29.884
MATT: All right.
LIAM: There will be no question.

00:42:33.704 --> 00:42:35.247
I would like to aim us,

00:42:38.602 --> 00:42:41.904
I don't know, a quarter-mile, a half-mile out of the place.

00:42:41.904 --> 00:42:42.737
MATT: Okay.

00:42:45.024 --> 00:42:45.857
All right.

00:42:46.944 --> 00:42:49.034
LIAM: Which I would remember somewhat
from running through the woods.

00:42:49.034 --> 00:42:52.450
MATT: That would be the path that you would
specifically aim towards.

00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:56.354
So as you all gather around Caleb,

00:42:56.354 --> 00:43:00.394
holding on to this necklace and memories,

00:43:00.394 --> 00:43:04.877
the odd, painful, yet also

00:43:04.877 --> 00:43:06.493
freedom-bearing memories

00:43:07.404 --> 00:43:08.504
it's anchored towards.

00:43:10.344 --> 00:43:12.544
You mutter your incantation, and all at once,

00:43:12.544 --> 00:43:14.084
you all can feel yourselves

00:43:14.084 --> 00:43:16.574
pulled through, like someone suddenly grabbed you

00:43:16.574 --> 00:43:19.344
by the front of your shirt and yanked you forward.

00:43:19.344 --> 00:43:21.134
And as you steady yourself with your foot

00:43:21.134 --> 00:43:23.804
instinctively hitting the floor in front of you,

00:43:23.804 --> 00:43:27.344
it hits grass, and mulch, and dirt.

00:43:27.344 --> 00:43:28.774
And your eyes adjust to look around you,

00:43:28.774 --> 00:43:31.587
as you are immediately surrounded by thick trees.

00:43:34.224 --> 00:43:36.264
Heavy leaf cover canopies above,

00:43:36.264 --> 00:43:40.157
and the smell of fresh, damp earth surrounds you.

00:43:44.264 --> 00:43:45.097
TRAVIS: Good.

00:43:46.604 --> 00:43:47.904
LIAM: Yeah, this is the place.

00:43:50.703 --> 00:43:52.123
Come.

00:43:52.123 --> 00:43:54.854
SAM: I mean, where in the woods
should we look for the big rock?

00:43:54.854 --> 00:43:56.720
Like the big--
LAURA: (laughs)

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.844
SAM: -- the big threshold crest-

00:43:57.844 --> 00:44:00.094
MARISHA: It's not a bad idea.

00:44:00.094 --> 00:44:01.844
Just keep an eye out, I guess,

00:44:01.844 --> 00:44:03.177
while we're looking.
TRAVIS: If you see a threshold crest.

00:44:03.177 --> 00:44:05.736
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: We'll go in to slow circles.

00:44:05.736 --> 00:44:06.712
Out from there.

00:44:08.804 --> 00:44:11.584
MATT: So who's leading, and what is the marching order here?

00:44:11.584 --> 00:44:13.494
LIAM: Caleb takes the lead.

00:44:13.494 --> 00:44:14.327
SAM: Ooh.
MATT: All right.

00:44:14.327 --> 00:44:15.160
TALIESIN: I'll drop behind you.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.964
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, straight up, huh?

00:44:17.964 --> 00:44:22.964
Should I Pass Without a Trace us immediately or what?

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.784
TALIESIN: Maybe when we get a little closer.

00:44:24.784 --> 00:44:27.004
LIAM: Yeah, we're a quarter, I aimed for a quarter-mile.

00:44:27.004 --> 00:44:28.620
LAURA: Okay.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.684
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:44:29.684 --> 00:44:31.234
TALIESIN: Right now, we're, you know--

00:44:31.234 --> 00:44:33.664
LIAM: Maybe we wait till we can see.
TALIESIN: -- just a bunch of people in the woods.

00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:34.674
LIAM: Breaking through the trees.

00:44:34.674 --> 00:44:36.804
ASHLEY: I'll hop behind Caduceus.

00:44:36.804 --> 00:44:38.384
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:39.964
MARISHA: I'll take the rear.

00:44:39.964 --> 00:44:41.714
MATT: All righty, and then Fjord and Veth,

00:44:41.714 --> 00:44:44.004
are you up in this space then?

00:44:44.004 --> 00:44:44.837
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:44:45.824 --> 00:44:46.657
MATT: Okay.

00:44:51.694 --> 00:44:52.727
Who's keeping watch?

00:44:54.794 --> 00:44:56.234
All right, go ahead and roll a perception check,

00:44:56.234 --> 00:44:57.514
if you don't mind.

00:44:57.514 --> 00:44:58.714
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Just one of us?

00:44:58.714 --> 00:45:01.124
MARISHA: Well, I'll check the rear.

00:45:01.124 --> 00:45:02.374
I'll watch from behind.

00:45:02.374 --> 00:45:04.441
MATT: Okay, perception for both of you.

00:45:04.441 --> 00:45:05.285
[birds tweeting]

00:45:05.285 --> 00:45:06.793
TALIESIN: Hmm.
MARISHA: Eh.

00:45:07.784 --> 00:45:08.684
SAM: There's a lot of birds here.

00:45:08.684 --> 00:45:09.664
MARISHA: 22.
TALIESIN: 17.

00:45:09.664 --> 00:45:11.222
SAM: Too many birds.

00:45:11.222 --> 00:45:13.567
(light laughter)

00:45:13.567 --> 00:45:14.651
I'm just suspicious.

00:45:14.651 --> 00:45:17.387
MARISHA: Used to creepy places with no birds, that's all.

00:45:18.502 --> 00:45:19.493
[birds chirping]

00:45:19.493 --> 00:45:20.824
TALIESIN: It's like--

00:45:20.824 --> 00:45:22.162
SAM: You're right.

00:45:22.162 --> 00:45:24.224
TALIESIN: Wow, there are birds, wow.

00:45:24.224 --> 00:45:26.529
TRAVIS: Not just birds.
MARISHA: Fuck these birds.

00:45:26.529 --> 00:45:27.362
TRAVIS: Pigeons.

00:45:27.362 --> 00:45:29.999
(laughter)

00:45:29.999 --> 00:45:31.660
Go away.
TALIESIN: I think a wild [inaudible].

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.327
TRAVIS: Turn around, fool.

00:45:35.175 --> 00:45:38.424
MATT: Trekking through this not even a forest path,

00:45:38.424 --> 00:45:41.284
just a space between the roots.

00:45:41.284 --> 00:45:43.767
You leading on, keeping eyes peeled.

00:45:45.634 --> 00:45:47.554
It's weirdly beautiful,

00:45:47.554 --> 00:45:50.874
especially given your recent journeys to be here

00:45:50.874 --> 00:45:54.137
in the thicket of nature of this kind, at least.

00:45:55.524 --> 00:45:59.674
Taking care with footsteps to not make too much noise,

00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:02.357
pushing past a tree to tree, continuing on,

00:46:03.304 --> 00:46:05.434
you can still feel some of the morning dew,

00:46:05.434 --> 00:46:08.827
residue on some of the lower reaching plants and ferns.

00:46:10.344 --> 00:46:13.514
It's a pretty heavy canopy, but it breaks at times,

00:46:13.514 --> 00:46:16.737
and you get a bit of that sunlight, warmth hits your face.

00:46:19.603 --> 00:46:21.564
A short time into this walk,

00:46:21.564 --> 00:46:24.384
you see Caleb seize up for a moment,

00:46:24.384 --> 00:46:28.234
as you begin to see, just peeking through

00:46:28.234 --> 00:46:32.097
some of the nearby trees, some of the shapes of stone,

00:46:33.114 --> 00:46:34.734
and a hint of the iron fence

00:46:34.734 --> 00:46:37.380
that marks the exterior of the sanatorium.

00:46:39.671 --> 00:46:40.987
LIAM: Caduceus, do you--?

00:46:42.454 --> 00:46:44.757
We're close, so we need to sneak in.

00:46:46.164 --> 00:46:50.517
Do you see anyone on the outskirts?

00:46:51.697 --> 00:46:54.769
TALIESIN: People, people, do I see people?

00:46:54.769 --> 00:46:55.735
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:46:55.735 --> 00:46:56.568
TALIESIN: All right.

00:46:57.474 --> 00:46:58.384
LAURA: Guidance.

00:46:58.384 --> 00:46:59.500
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:47:02.951 --> 00:47:03.784
Ooh.

00:47:05.242 --> 00:47:06.194
26.

00:47:06.194 --> 00:47:07.685
MATT: 26, very good.

00:47:09.384 --> 00:47:12.134
You do not see anybody on this edge

00:47:12.134 --> 00:47:15.214
of the patrolling exterior fence.

00:47:15.214 --> 00:47:16.994
Within, you can see number of hedges

00:47:16.994 --> 00:47:18.994
that scatter a bit,

00:47:18.994 --> 00:47:21.767
as well as tufts of heavy bush and tree.

00:47:23.024 --> 00:47:26.204
You do see the glimmer of light

00:47:26.204 --> 00:47:28.104
reflecting off of a helmet of some kind

00:47:28.104 --> 00:47:29.764
passing one of the hedges,

00:47:29.764 --> 00:47:33.144
a little ways into the actual courtyard itself.

00:47:33.144 --> 00:47:36.014
But no one's specifically at this edge.

00:47:36.014 --> 00:47:38.322
TALIESIN: We're clear here, I can see some

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:39.597
that looks like security

00:47:39.597 --> 00:47:42.744
in the hedges, or the hedge maze, whatever that is.

00:47:42.744 --> 00:47:44.792
They must have gardeners, this is immaculate.

00:47:44.792 --> 00:47:45.796
(laughter)

00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:47.694
Somebody's taking care of this.

00:47:47.694 --> 00:47:51.404
LIAM: Yeah, everything in its place,
and a place for everything.

00:47:51.404 --> 00:47:52.604
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's one over there.

00:47:52.604 --> 00:47:56.531
LIAM: DM, were you describing people on the outside or?

00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:57.694
MATT: This is the inside of the courtyard.

00:47:57.694 --> 00:48:00.514
LIAM: Within the black wrought iron fence you described.

00:48:00.514 --> 00:48:01.477
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:48:02.352 --> 00:48:03.814
LAURA: Should we follow along the outside

00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:05.624
until we get to the northwest corner?

00:48:05.624 --> 00:48:07.344
LIAM: Sun is there, so do I--

00:48:07.344 --> 00:48:10.214
I would know what direction we're coming from if--

00:48:10.214 --> 00:48:11.224
MATT: You guys are approaching

00:48:11.224 --> 00:48:12.864
from the eastern side at the moment.

00:48:12.864 --> 00:48:14.044
LAURA: Oh, so we have to get all the way around.

00:48:14.044 --> 00:48:15.234
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll hike.

00:48:15.234 --> 00:48:18.804
LIAM: So yeah, we'll take the time to go wide.

00:48:18.804 --> 00:48:19.664
TRAVIS: And it's fair to assume that

00:48:19.664 --> 00:48:21.214
because we're all the way out here,

00:48:21.214 --> 00:48:23.004
there's no pedestrian traffic.

00:48:23.004 --> 00:48:24.224
LIAM: No.

00:48:24.224 --> 00:48:25.671
LAURA: I'm going to--

00:48:25.671 --> 00:48:27.734
LIAM: Secluded for a--
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace?

00:48:27.734 --> 00:48:29.251
I mean, we're within view now, I feel like.

00:48:29.251 --> 00:48:30.284
TALIESIN: I mean, maybe it's time.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:48:30.284 --> 00:48:31.964
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace.

00:48:31.964 --> 00:48:33.609
MATT: Okay, just in time.

00:48:33.609 --> 00:48:35.234
I would like everyone to roll stealth check, please,

00:48:35.234 --> 00:48:36.999
as you make your way around the exterior.

00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:38.764
MARISHA: ♪ Makin' our way. ♪
MATT: Of the premises.

00:48:38.764 --> 00:48:41.513
TRAVIS: Do we have to stay near you for it to stay up?

00:48:41.513 --> 00:48:43.242
MARISHA: Oh, thank goodness gracious.
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

00:48:43.242 --> 00:48:44.450
MARISHA: Yep, same.

00:48:49.094 --> 00:48:50.454
SAM: Plus 10?

00:48:50.454 --> 00:48:51.287
LAURA: Plus 10.

00:48:51.287 --> 00:48:52.661
LIAM: Yep.
TRAVIS: 23.

00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:54.524
LIAM: So what are you at, like 72?

00:48:54.524 --> 00:48:55.357
LAURA: 31.

00:48:55.357 --> 00:48:56.690
LIAM: 29.
MATT: All righty.

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:57.790
SAM: 43.

00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:58.894
LIAM: Yeah!

00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:00.460
ASHLEY: 23.
LIAM: He can do better.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.301
TALIESIN: 19.
SAM: I could.

00:49:01.301 --> 00:49:03.192
LIAM: She can do better.
MARISHA: 25.

00:49:03.192 --> 00:49:04.025
MATT: Okay.

00:49:05.144 --> 00:49:08.394
As Jester's spell kicks in, and you begin to walk,

00:49:08.394 --> 00:49:12.264
even the faintest of foot touches against the soil beneath

00:49:12.264 --> 00:49:14.924
make no sound, and the shadows seem

00:49:14.924 --> 00:49:17.704
to grow ever darker in your presence.

00:49:17.704 --> 00:49:20.754
Ominous at first, but welcome as you continue forward,

00:49:20.754 --> 00:49:24.954
feeling like you are near impossible to be noticed.

00:49:24.954 --> 00:49:28.187
Gliding on around the northeastern edge,

00:49:29.094 --> 00:49:32.294
you can begin to make out through the tree line,

00:49:32.294 --> 00:49:36.524
and beyond the fence, the extravagant tower

00:49:36.524 --> 00:49:41.394
that is the summer abode, if you will, of Trent Ikithon.

00:49:41.394 --> 00:49:43.617
A location you're quite familiar with, Caleb.

00:49:46.144 --> 00:49:47.704
Continuing on past that point,

00:49:47.704 --> 00:49:51.224
you hit the clear northern side,

00:49:51.224 --> 00:49:52.774
and keeping watch out there,

00:49:52.774 --> 00:49:55.604
there are a number of other guards you see pass,

00:49:55.604 --> 00:49:58.894
two more that cross ways.

00:49:58.894 --> 00:50:01.164
One further in, one that's keeping close to the perimeter,

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:04.594
that occasionally glances out into the tree line.

00:50:04.594 --> 00:50:05.987
You all pause for a moment,

00:50:07.754 --> 00:50:10.344
but feel clear like you weren't noticed.

00:50:10.344 --> 00:50:11.394
MARISHA: As we're walking,

00:50:11.394 --> 00:50:15.024
I just want to try and keep a beat on a how many-ish guards

00:50:15.024 --> 00:50:18.622
there are and their patrol pattern, if I can.

00:50:18.622 --> 00:50:20.774
MATT: You've now noticed three.

00:50:20.774 --> 00:50:21.607
MARISHA: Three.

00:50:23.306 --> 00:50:24.854
What time of day is it?

00:50:24.854 --> 00:50:28.979
MATT: At this point, it would be probably
pushing close to noon.

00:50:31.674 --> 00:50:32.507
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:32.507 --> 00:50:34.954
LIAM: I'm going to slow our progression down for a moment.

00:50:35.924 --> 00:50:37.707
Do you have your paints handy?

00:50:38.847 --> 00:50:40.642
I think we can use those to get through this fence.

00:50:40.642 --> 00:50:41.784
LAURA: Yeah, I was hoping.

00:50:43.744 --> 00:50:45.387
LIAM: So before we get any closer,

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:48.597
I was thinking,

00:50:49.824 --> 00:50:51.984
I am open to discussion briefly here,

00:50:51.984 --> 00:50:54.247
but I was thinking, you two,

00:50:59.564 --> 00:51:01.022
no.

00:51:01.022 --> 00:51:02.254
LAURA: What?

00:51:02.254 --> 00:51:03.934
LIAM: I'm trying to decide who's best to go in,

00:51:03.934 --> 00:51:05.412
and who's to stay.

00:51:06.494 --> 00:51:09.277
TRAVIS: Not me, I'll stay out here.

00:51:09.277 --> 00:51:10.110
SAM: Really?

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:13.043
But you can bamf in and out.
LIAM: I actually want you to come inside.

00:51:13.043 --> 00:51:15.970
TRAVIS: I mean, I am down for this part.

00:51:16.932 --> 00:51:19.984
I was just trying to do the cool kid thing.

00:51:19.984 --> 00:51:21.054
TALIESIN: We appreciate it.

00:51:21.054 --> 00:51:22.664
MARISHA: I guess it depends on what kind of a distraction

00:51:22.664 --> 00:51:23.864
you want on the outside.

00:51:25.304 --> 00:51:26.724
If that's the way we're doing it.

00:51:26.724 --> 00:51:28.154
SAM: Are you going in, Caleb?

00:51:28.154 --> 00:51:30.764
LIAM: Yes, yes.

00:51:30.764 --> 00:51:31.597
SAM: Okay.

00:51:32.624 --> 00:51:35.344
LIAM: I think you should stay up top, Jester.

00:51:35.344 --> 00:51:36.177
LAURA: Why?

00:51:36.177 --> 00:51:39.214
LIAM: Well, you're good at, you're distracting.

00:51:39.214 --> 00:51:40.444
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm also really good

00:51:40.444 --> 00:51:42.094
at sneaking in and out of things.

00:51:43.664 --> 00:51:46.624
SAM: We are searching for something hidden,

00:51:46.624 --> 00:51:49.817
and she and I are the best at finding clues.

00:51:51.494 --> 00:51:53.264
LAURA: It's the truth.

00:51:53.264 --> 00:51:57.094
Plus, think about it, I can sneak us in right now.

00:51:57.094 --> 00:51:59.674
I could get us out of scraps, what if we get trapped?

00:51:59.674 --> 00:52:01.564
I could paint us a hole and get us out.

00:52:01.564 --> 00:52:04.024
I could, I could Blink,

00:52:04.024 --> 00:52:06.544
I could turn us all into ghosts or something,

00:52:06.544 --> 00:52:09.703
I can't do that, but I think it could be really cool.

00:52:09.703 --> 00:52:14.294
TRAVIS: Also, if you want to do something more specific

00:52:14.294 --> 00:52:15.494
than just a hole in the fence,

00:52:15.494 --> 00:52:16.754
I could create a doorway

00:52:16.754 --> 00:52:19.560
that any number of us could walk through openly--

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.202
SAM: What, when did that happen?
TRAVIS: -- for 10 minutes.

00:52:21.202 --> 00:52:23.753
And just put you anywhere within 500 feet.

00:52:23.753 --> 00:52:24.753
LAURA: (gasps)

00:52:24.753 --> 00:52:26.094
LIAM: But for this fence on the outside,

00:52:26.094 --> 00:52:29.994
I was thinking that some of us just holding the iron bars,

00:52:29.994 --> 00:52:31.611
while Jester did a little inch here,

00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:32.554
and a little inch down there.

00:52:32.554 --> 00:52:35.216
And then we'd just remove three or four bars.
LAURA: What's that mean?

00:52:35.216 --> 00:52:36.564
That's fucking cool!

00:52:36.564 --> 00:52:39.374
MARISHA: Wait, did you say it can get you within 500 feet?

00:52:39.374 --> 00:52:41.294
TRAVIS: From where I am, I can make a door here

00:52:41.294 --> 00:52:43.364
next to me within 10 feet.
LIAM: Since when?

00:52:43.364 --> 00:52:46.187
TRAVIS: Another door, it's just, I woke up with it.

00:52:46.187 --> 00:52:48.804
(laughter)

00:52:48.804 --> 00:52:50.184
I mean, look, you guys,

00:52:50.184 --> 00:52:52.484
my dreams are usually pretty private, okay?

00:52:52.484 --> 00:52:55.835
You guys pry like a son of a bitch.

00:52:55.835 --> 00:52:57.477
LAURA: Does that mean you can open up doorways?

00:52:57.477 --> 00:52:58.310
TRAVIS: I mean, yes.

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.114
LAURA: Opening doorways.
TRAVIS: Archways.

00:53:00.114 --> 00:53:01.844
MARISHA: That seems like a pretty good candidate

00:53:01.844 --> 00:53:03.854
for once we're inside.

00:53:03.854 --> 00:53:05.354
TRAVIS: Also, the doorway that I create

00:53:05.354 --> 00:53:07.704
500 feet away is invisible.

00:53:07.704 --> 00:53:10.404
MARISHA: I mean, that's how we get in the tower, right?

00:53:10.404 --> 00:53:12.184
SAM: Why don't we just do it from here

00:53:12.184 --> 00:53:13.509
and go straight into the tower?

00:53:13.509 --> 00:53:14.342
TRAVIS: I have to be able to see it, but I could

00:53:14.342 --> 00:53:15.464
put you right next to the tower,

00:53:15.464 --> 00:53:17.484
and in theory, you would appear next to the tower,

00:53:17.484 --> 00:53:18.734
and not be seen until you were--

00:53:18.734 --> 00:53:19.567
LIAM: How long?

00:53:19.567 --> 00:53:21.874
TRAVIS: In 10 minutes.
LIAM: 10 minutes.

00:53:21.874 --> 00:53:23.624
MARISHA: How far away are we from the tower?

00:53:23.624 --> 00:53:24.457
LIAM: 10 minutes.

00:53:26.004 --> 00:53:27.514
MATT: You haven't yet gotten to the point

00:53:27.514 --> 00:53:30.344
where you can clearly see, this deep into the forest,

00:53:30.344 --> 00:53:31.944
the location that you're heading towards.

00:53:31.944 --> 00:53:34.054
You're still in on the northern edge.

00:53:34.054 --> 00:53:35.264
You have a little ways travel

00:53:35.264 --> 00:53:37.834
before you'll be near the northwestern side,

00:53:37.834 --> 00:53:38.754
where the tower is.

00:53:38.754 --> 00:53:39.587
MARISHA: All right.

00:53:39.587 --> 00:53:41.007
LIAM: How many times can you do this?

00:53:42.324 --> 00:53:43.284
SAM: It gets us in.

00:53:43.284 --> 00:53:45.394
TALIESIN: We have a Stone Shape also,
which is another option,

00:53:45.394 --> 00:53:46.814
we can make a hole and then close it up.

00:53:46.814 --> 00:53:49.024
MATT: You do have to be able to see both locations.

00:53:49.024 --> 00:53:49.857
That's the thing, yeah.

00:53:49.857 --> 00:53:51.974
SAM: That's okay, with that, Fjord can get us in.

00:53:51.974 --> 00:53:53.564
Jester could get you out

00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:57.454
with a little Dimension Door action.

00:53:57.454 --> 00:54:00.014
LIAM: Yes, it is easier for us
to run like hell, that's true.

00:54:00.014 --> 00:54:02.074
MARISHA: I do think whoever can cast Message,

00:54:02.074 --> 00:54:03.704
we need to split those two people out,

00:54:03.704 --> 00:54:07.064
because if we're having some people watching,

00:54:07.064 --> 00:54:10.552
if the guards start running in, we got to let you know.

00:54:10.552 --> 00:54:11.385
LAURA: It's true.

00:54:11.385 --> 00:54:12.614
ASHLEY: I could stay outside if--

00:54:12.614 --> 00:54:15.554
LIAM: It's so hard, though, she's our lockpick.

00:54:15.554 --> 00:54:20.554
MARISHA: I am-- look, we could build these teams either way,

00:54:20.644 --> 00:54:24.094
and each one of us will have our own bag of tricks.

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:26.004
It's just whatever you want.

00:54:26.004 --> 00:54:28.031
SAM: What were you saying, Yashers?

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:30.744
ASHLEY: I could stay out here if you need--

00:54:30.744 --> 00:54:33.274
SAM: Kill people?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:54:33.274 --> 00:54:35.984
But what, do we want to create a distraction,

00:54:35.984 --> 00:54:37.354
or do we just sneak in?

00:54:37.354 --> 00:54:39.404
TALIESIN: Maybe a distraction if things go wrong.

00:54:40.304 --> 00:54:41.137
LAURA: Yeah.

00:54:42.618 --> 00:54:45.260
SAM: You just have big bags under your eyes today.

00:54:46.234 --> 00:54:49.204
It's like you got nothing, no sleep at all, like, nothing.

00:54:49.204 --> 00:54:51.594
MARISHA: I think she is very glowing and radiant.

00:54:51.594 --> 00:54:53.502
TALIESIN: She looks radiant, I would call her radiant.
ASHLEY: I, yeah, I feel like--

00:54:53.502 --> 00:54:55.185
SAM: You look like you always do.
ASHLEY: Thank you, Beau.

00:54:55.185 --> 00:54:56.885
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:54:56.885 --> 00:54:58.974
ASHLEY: I feel very wonderful.
LIAM: I'm not sure if that was a compliment.

00:54:58.974 --> 00:54:59.932
MARISHA: Since high school, what?

00:54:59.932 --> 00:55:01.419
LIAM: I don't think that was a compliment.

00:55:01.419 --> 00:55:02.962
MARISHA: Oh.

00:55:02.962 --> 00:55:04.573
Well, fuck you.

00:55:07.063 --> 00:55:09.294
TALIESIN: Can I say the thing? I want to say the thing.

00:55:09.294 --> 00:55:10.127
MARISHA: What?

00:55:10.127 --> 00:55:11.793
TALIESIN: There are advantages to both.

00:55:11.793 --> 00:55:13.146
MARISHA: Advantages to both!

00:55:14.543 --> 00:55:15.460
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:19.329 --> 00:55:20.162
LIAM: You make a strong argument

00:55:20.162 --> 00:55:21.583
for being able to talk back and forth.

00:55:21.583 --> 00:55:22.693
MARISHA: We have to.

00:55:22.693 --> 00:55:23.703
If something goes wrong,

00:55:23.703 --> 00:55:25.573
then what's the point of having a lookout team?

00:55:25.573 --> 00:55:28.126
LIAM: How far from the fence to the tower?

00:55:29.563 --> 00:55:30.795
MATT: You haven't spent a lot of time

00:55:30.795 --> 00:55:31.985
in that area of the courtyard.

00:55:31.985 --> 00:55:33.663
You're not entirely certain.

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:34.911
You might have to get a bit closer

00:55:34.911 --> 00:55:36.784
to the location to gauge that.
LIAM: Okay.

00:55:36.784 --> 00:55:38.042
SAM: Is there another signal,

00:55:38.042 --> 00:55:39.858
like if Caduceus is staying out here,

00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:42.049
I don't mean to imply that you are,

00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:45.826
but do you have other magical means of communicating?

00:55:47.953 --> 00:55:49.086
TALIEISN: No.
SAM: Like,

00:55:49.086 --> 00:55:51.093
could you make an earthquake that shakes the earth

00:55:51.093 --> 00:55:52.573
around us or something and lets us know--

00:55:52.573 --> 00:55:54.603
TALIESIN: Yes, I could actually do that, that's true.

00:55:54.603 --> 00:55:55.633
I can actually do that.

00:55:55.633 --> 00:55:57.221
Wow, I could do that!

00:55:57.221 --> 00:56:00.592
(laughter)

00:56:00.592 --> 00:56:02.053
TRAVIS: Come on, man!

00:56:02.053 --> 00:56:04.369
(laughter)

00:56:04.369 --> 00:56:06.343
TRAVIS: "I can't do that.
I might be able to do that.

00:56:06.343 --> 00:56:08.393
"I think I could do that.
I could do that!"

00:56:08.393 --> 00:56:11.293
ASHLEY: Also, you can talk to me.

00:56:11.293 --> 00:56:13.933
We've done it before, I know how to Message

00:56:13.933 --> 00:56:15.383
and talk to Nott.

00:56:16.591 --> 00:56:18.123
SAM: That's true.

00:56:18.123 --> 00:56:18.983
ASHLEY: Yeah, it works.

00:56:18.983 --> 00:56:20.813
I just, she was there and then--

00:56:20.813 --> 00:56:22.923
SAM: I could just Message her and ask

00:56:22.923 --> 00:56:24.293
for a response constantly.

00:56:24.293 --> 00:56:25.143
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

00:56:26.073 --> 00:56:28.243
SAM: Or like she's saying she could just Message me.

00:56:28.243 --> 00:56:29.373
TRAVIS: You guys have a connection?

00:56:29.373 --> 00:56:30.529
ASHLEY: I don't know how it works,

00:56:30.529 --> 00:56:32.670
but I talk to her and she can hear me.

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:34.518
TRAVIS: That's incredible.

00:56:34.518 --> 00:56:35.368
SAM: Try it right now.

00:56:35.368 --> 00:56:36.835
LIAM: Right, we all forgot that

00:56:36.835 --> 00:56:38.319
nuance of the spell.
ASHLEY: I walk 10 feet away.

00:56:38.319 --> 00:56:40.377
LIAM: It also depends on how close--
SAM: Yeah, I can hear you!

00:56:40.377 --> 00:56:42.200
LIAM: -- the tower is to the fence.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.123
If it's greater than 20 feet, dead.
TRAVIS: Proof!

00:56:45.123 --> 00:56:46.423
MARISHA: Oh, I was assuming we were all

00:56:46.423 --> 00:56:50.723
going inside the fence, right?

00:56:50.723 --> 00:56:52.473
LAURA: -- stay outside completely.

00:56:52.473 --> 00:56:54.313
TALIESIN: How close is the tower to the fence?

00:56:54.313 --> 00:56:56.778
LIAM: We have to get closer to find that out.

00:56:56.778 --> 00:56:57.934
MATT: Or at least close to the edge--
LAURA: Okay, let's keep wandering

00:56:57.934 --> 00:56:59.050
so we can at least see the tower.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:00.752
ASHLEY: But what if something goes bad inside

00:57:00.752 --> 00:57:03.347
and then how do we get in there, or, you know?

00:57:03.347 --> 00:57:05.030
TALIESIN: I think we just make a giant mess

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:06.863
and see how many guards we can pull

00:57:08.233 --> 00:57:09.066
away from the tower.

00:57:09.066 --> 00:57:10.623
LAURA: I think we need to split at least

00:57:10.623 --> 00:57:12.454
me and Caduceus because--

00:57:12.454 --> 00:57:13.513
TALIESIN: That's always a good idea.
LAURA: -- we need to have

00:57:13.513 --> 00:57:16.953
options to get everybody out if possible with our--

00:57:16.953 --> 00:57:20.713
TALIESIN: I also do have three Freedom of Movement spells

00:57:20.713 --> 00:57:23.156
for the beginning of this, if that helps.

00:57:25.243 --> 00:57:26.913
TRAVIS: Remember the glyphs.

00:57:26.913 --> 00:57:28.573
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, got to have people

00:57:28.573 --> 00:57:31.117
with magic to Dispel.

00:57:31.117 --> 00:57:33.721
TRAVIS: We need at least four of them.

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.693
ASHLEY: (whispering) Nott, can you hear me?

00:57:36.693 --> 00:57:37.933
SAM: Yeah, I can totally hear you.

00:57:37.933 --> 00:57:38.766
ASHLEY: See, it's fine.

00:57:38.766 --> 00:57:40.063
TALIESIN: I can hear you, too.

00:57:40.063 --> 00:57:41.987
LIAM: That's why I wanted you inside.
ASHLEY: You can?

00:57:41.987 --> 00:57:44.143
TALIESIN: Right now, yeah.
TRAVIS: I don't have Dispel Magic.

00:57:44.143 --> 00:57:45.809
LAURA: I do.
LIAM: Do you have Counterspell?

00:57:45.809 --> 00:57:48.968
TRAVIS: I do, I do.
LAURA: Oh.

00:57:48.968 --> 00:57:50.143
LAURA: You have Counterspell.

00:57:50.143 --> 00:57:50.976
ASHLEY: So stupid.

00:57:52.133 --> 00:57:56.933
MATT: All right, as you guys carefully, semi-quietly

00:57:56.933 --> 00:58:01.933
approach the northwestern edge of the sanatorium grounds,

00:58:02.583 --> 00:58:04.763
you begin to see the simple stone building

00:58:04.763 --> 00:58:08.399
and the simple stone tower that rises up maybe

00:58:08.399 --> 00:58:10.963
25, 30 feet into the air.

00:58:10.963 --> 00:58:12.753
This looks to be, and especially in comparison

00:58:12.753 --> 00:58:14.723
to a lot of the other pieces of architecture

00:58:14.723 --> 00:58:19.723
on these grounds, not as beautified.

00:58:19.763 --> 00:58:21.563
A little more of a function

00:58:21.563 --> 00:58:23.763
before anything else type structure.

00:58:23.763 --> 00:58:26.953
But you do see on the exterior of it

00:58:28.483 --> 00:58:30.083
some bushes, some flowers.

00:58:30.083 --> 00:58:31.390
It looks like they're still keeping the grounds around it

00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:32.223
to try to match at least

00:58:32.223 --> 00:58:33.553
some of the rest of the beautification

00:58:33.553 --> 00:58:37.123
that takes place and is maintained here.

00:58:37.123 --> 00:58:40.118
You do see two guards that are posted,

00:58:40.118 --> 00:58:42.183
one that's just sitting in a chair outside the door

00:58:42.183 --> 00:58:44.486
and is currently whittling away at something,

00:58:44.486 --> 00:58:45.993
weapon to the side,

00:58:45.993 --> 00:58:48.543
and you see one that's currently patrolling

00:58:48.543 --> 00:58:50.773
maybe 30, 40 feet from him,

00:58:50.773 --> 00:58:52.633
doing the rounds on the corner.

00:58:52.633 --> 00:58:55.553
So right now, you only see one at the actual front

00:58:55.553 --> 00:58:57.263
of where the tower entrance is,

00:58:57.263 --> 00:58:59.043
facing in the southward way,

00:58:59.043 --> 00:59:01.399
what would be approximately here.

00:59:02.553 --> 00:59:03.436
This being south.

00:59:04.993 --> 00:59:06.653
Facing this direction and one individual

00:59:06.653 --> 00:59:07.711
who's way over here and is currently

00:59:07.711 --> 00:59:08.970
just walking and patrolling.

00:59:10.723 --> 00:59:12.453
LAURA: And where are we in relation to that?

00:59:12.453 --> 00:59:14.443
MATT: You would be over

00:59:14.443 --> 00:59:16.693
way off this side in the forest,

00:59:16.693 --> 00:59:19.063
barely looking through the wrought iron fence

00:59:19.063 --> 00:59:20.493
and then gauging that.

00:59:20.493 --> 00:59:24.063
The actually structure itself sits about 60 or so feet

00:59:24.063 --> 00:59:25.103
from the wrought iron fence.

00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:25.936
MARISHA: Okay.

00:59:29.233 --> 00:59:30.826
And how tall is the tower?

00:59:32.173 --> 00:59:33.933
MATT: How tall is the tower?

00:59:33.933 --> 00:59:36.046
It's about 25, 30 feet, I think I said.

00:59:37.976 --> 00:59:39.543
MARISHA: Anything on top of the tower?

00:59:39.543 --> 00:59:41.663
MATT: No, it's just a flat tower.

00:59:41.663 --> 00:59:44.513
Make a perception check if you
want to see anything specific.

00:59:45.553 --> 00:59:46.673
MARISHA: Does it look like--

00:59:46.673 --> 00:59:49.083
Oh yikes, that's a natural one.

00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:50.353
It doesn't look like shit.

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:52.382
MATT: No, looks like a tower.

00:59:52.382 --> 00:59:54.413
But it's flat, there's no point or apex to it.

00:59:54.413 --> 00:59:58.781
It's just a brief, minor crenelation, flattened.

00:59:58.781 --> 01:00:00.403
TRAVIS: And you have the Ioun stone, right?

01:00:00.403 --> 01:00:02.656
TALIESIN: Bad in the rain.
MARISHA: Hmm?

01:00:02.656 --> 01:00:04.164
TALIESIN: You get a lot of impacted snow on that,

01:00:04.164 --> 01:00:07.263
it's going to fall right in, right through.

01:00:07.263 --> 01:00:10.503
MARISHA: You know so much about
home maintenance and gardening.

01:00:10.503 --> 01:00:11.883
TALIESIN: You've seen where I live?

01:00:11.883 --> 01:00:13.220
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.226
TALIESIN: Had to rebuild that thing four times.

01:00:17.163 --> 01:00:18.663
LAURA: What are you thinking, Caleb?

01:00:19.823 --> 01:00:22.573
LIAM: Maybe if we can get rid of these two somehow we can--

01:00:22.573 --> 01:00:24.294
SAM: Guards?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:00:24.294 --> 01:00:25.785
SAM: (clicks crossbow)
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

01:00:25.785 --> 01:00:27.563
MARISHA: It's, um--
LAURA: What if they're discovered?

01:00:27.563 --> 01:00:29.233
That will give us away really quick.

01:00:29.233 --> 01:00:32.333
MARISHA: It's noon, my first thought was

01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:35.656
there might be a shift change soon.

01:00:36.973 --> 01:00:37.886
Lunch break.

01:00:39.373 --> 01:00:40.206
I don't know.

01:00:41.393 --> 01:00:44.286
LAURA: Why don't we have Fjord--

01:00:45.493 --> 01:00:47.873
Why don't we open up the fence,

01:00:47.873 --> 01:00:49.503
go around to the back of the tower,

01:00:49.503 --> 01:00:51.946
I'll paint us a hole in the tower, we go in.

01:00:54.087 --> 01:00:55.493
TALIESIN: There will be a hole in the tower, then.

01:00:55.493 --> 01:00:57.293
MARISHA: Did you say we have Fjord--

01:00:57.293 --> 01:00:58.126
was that part of Fjord?

01:00:58.126 --> 01:00:59.643
LAURA: Well, I was going to say we could have Fjord

01:00:59.643 --> 01:01:01.383
do the door thing, but I don't know if we want

01:01:01.383 --> 01:01:02.463
to use that up already.

01:01:02.463 --> 01:01:04.840
LIAM: Well, if we go--
SAM: I think we could.

01:01:06.584 --> 01:01:08.443
LIAM: -- further past the tower,

01:01:08.443 --> 01:01:11.186
do we see further guards on the other side of it?

01:01:12.283 --> 01:01:14.471
MATT: So if you continue this way,

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:17.163
and hook around the edge of where the fence

01:01:17.163 --> 01:01:21.723
adjusts itself to the western side of the premises.

01:01:21.723 --> 01:01:23.723
You can see beyond that, once again, the shape

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:26.723
of the larger sanatorium central building structure.

01:01:26.723 --> 01:01:29.333
A little ways this direction, about a hundred or so feet

01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:31.723
from that building, you can see one of

01:01:31.723 --> 01:01:34.086
the two smaller mansion-type abodes.

01:01:36.363 --> 01:01:37.563
Make a perception check.

01:01:43.103 --> 01:01:44.663
LIAM: 24.

01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:46.288
MATT: 24.

01:01:46.288 --> 01:01:48.288
You see two other additional guards

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.553
that are currently just doing a walk around.

01:01:50.553 --> 01:01:53.003
So based on the ground that you've covered

01:01:53.003 --> 01:01:55.253
and the center of this courtyard, you've seen

01:01:56.843 --> 01:02:00.353
roughly five guards patrolling on the

01:02:00.353 --> 01:02:03.113
central to northern side, and then there's one

01:02:03.113 --> 01:02:05.523
that is stationed outside that you noticed of this tower.

01:02:05.523 --> 01:02:06.563
So six guards total.

01:02:06.563 --> 01:02:08.283
SAM: What if we took out a couple of them,

01:02:08.283 --> 01:02:10.943
not by killing them, but what if,

01:02:10.943 --> 01:02:12.560
hear me out, here's my pitch,

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.263
Caduceus just walks up to the front of the gate,

01:02:15.263 --> 01:02:19.793
and says, "I admire your gardening here

01:02:19.793 --> 01:02:22.133
"and I would like to apply for a job as a gardener,"

01:02:22.133 --> 01:02:24.596
and just talks to a bunch of them, tries to--

01:02:24.596 --> 01:02:25.962
TALIESIN: I don't want to apply for a job.

01:02:25.962 --> 01:02:27.184
SAM: Well, I know you'd be lying, you'd be lying.

01:02:27.184 --> 01:02:29.523
TALIESIN: I'm not, I think we've established
I'm very bad at that.

01:02:29.523 --> 01:02:30.383
LAURA: He's really, really, really--

01:02:30.383 --> 01:02:31.216
TALIESIN: I don't feel comfortable--

01:02:31.216 --> 01:02:33.313
SAM: Well, then just talk about how lovely the gardens are.

01:02:33.313 --> 01:02:34.213
TALIESIN: That I can do.

01:02:34.213 --> 01:02:36.117
Actually, I'd love a tour, to be honest.

01:02:36.117 --> 01:02:37.753
They're just gorgeous.
SAM: You could ask for a tour.

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:39.953
They're not going to arrest you for asking for a tour.

01:02:39.953 --> 01:02:41.773
Maybe you'll get two or three of them

01:02:41.773 --> 01:02:43.353
to come over and say, what's going on?

01:02:43.353 --> 01:02:45.503
What's this cow man talking about the gardens for?

01:02:45.503 --> 01:02:48.467
ASHLEY: I actually wouldn't mind
having a tour of the garden. They're beautiful.

01:02:48.467 --> 01:02:49.513
LIAM: Question, DM.

01:02:49.513 --> 01:02:51.913
Looking at the map that Astrid gave me,

01:02:51.913 --> 01:02:55.737
there's what looks like three little cubbies on the map.

01:02:55.737 --> 01:02:58.133
Do I know what those signify?

01:02:58.133 --> 01:02:58.966
MATT: Over here?

01:02:58.966 --> 01:03:00.733
LIAM: The little teeth, yeah.

01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:03.073
MATT: You do not see from that edge,

01:03:03.073 --> 01:03:04.973
it looks like it may have been

01:03:04.973 --> 01:03:08.411
a long time ago like a stable portion,

01:03:08.411 --> 01:03:10.453
but you have no sight from your current perspective

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:13.253
to see if there's anything currently hitched over there.

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:16.383
LIAM: I have an idea. Quick, come, come, come.

01:03:16.383 --> 01:03:19.023
I want to try to come back around and try

01:03:19.023 --> 01:03:22.756
to get a view of that side of the wall.

01:03:23.663 --> 01:03:26.863
So that room with the stairs drawn in it,

01:03:26.863 --> 01:03:29.406
I'm trying to get a look at the wall outside it.

01:03:30.453 --> 01:03:32.493
MATT: That's easy to do. You guys are traversing

01:03:32.493 --> 01:03:35.773
the northern side of the courtyard here.

01:03:35.773 --> 01:03:38.623
So you can see the back half of this building pretty easy.

01:03:38.623 --> 01:03:40.723
LIAM: How noticeable are these doors of yours?

01:03:41.663 --> 01:03:42.523
TRAVIS: They are--
SAM: It's invisible?

01:03:42.523 --> 01:03:45.163
TRAVIS: They're invisible to people that are looking.

01:03:45.163 --> 01:03:46.413
So you will just appear.

01:03:48.143 --> 01:03:49.473
LIAM: Jester?
LAURA: What?

01:03:49.473 --> 01:03:51.093
LIAM: Why don't you paint a hole through the door

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.716
into the wall to those stairs?

01:03:53.813 --> 01:03:56.633
TRAVIS: She will appear outside of the tower

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:57.466
and however long--

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:59.723
LIAM: Not if the door is facing that wall

01:03:59.723 --> 01:04:03.523
to the stairs, and then we just walk right into that room.

01:04:03.523 --> 01:04:06.053
MATT: To clarify, they're not invisible,

01:04:06.053 --> 01:04:08.333
they're only visible from--
LAURA: One side.

01:04:08.333 --> 01:04:09.166
MATT: From one side.

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:10.383
TRAVIS: Sorry, correct.

01:04:10.383 --> 01:04:12.953
LIAM: So you make the side that it would be visible--

01:04:12.953 --> 01:04:14.803
TRAVIS: Facing to where you want to go and then--

01:04:14.803 --> 01:04:16.303
LIAM: And then you literally are going to reach

01:04:16.303 --> 01:04:18.244
through his door and go (drawing).

01:04:18.244 --> 01:04:20.193
And we'll walk from our location out here

01:04:20.193 --> 01:04:21.993
in to that room.
TRAVIS: That's the idea.

01:04:21.993 --> 01:04:23.535
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

01:04:23.535 --> 01:04:25.333
So if anybody was watching, though, they might

01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:26.933
be able to see a hole being painted.

01:04:26.933 --> 01:04:30.603
TRAVIS: They could, except for the giant dragon

01:04:30.603 --> 01:04:32.570
that will appear on the other side of the campus.

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:33.403
MARISHA: There we go.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:35.543
TRAVIS: Outside of the fence, and make a ruckus

01:04:35.543 --> 01:04:36.533
for I don't know, a minute.

01:04:36.533 --> 01:04:38.303
SAM: You can do both of those things at the same time?

01:04:38.303 --> 01:04:39.946
LAURA: Is it good, though, to do that?

01:04:39.946 --> 01:04:42.403
Wouldn't that let them know that something was up?

01:04:42.403 --> 01:04:43.516
TRAVIS: No, I can't.

01:04:43.516 --> 01:04:44.474
LAURA: I feel like if--

01:04:44.474 --> 01:04:47.163
SAM: But Caduceus can ask for-- ooh.
LIAM: But I can.

01:04:47.163 --> 01:04:48.173
I can make that illusion.

01:04:48.173 --> 01:04:50.765
LAURA: No, but if we make that illusion, and then

01:04:50.765 --> 01:04:51.843
the illusion goes away.
LIAM: But not a dragon.

01:04:51.843 --> 01:04:53.513
Something more mundane.

01:04:53.513 --> 01:04:55.083
TRAVIS: Just to make people go, "Huh?"

01:04:55.083 --> 01:04:57.283
LIAM: Something mundane, yeah.
TRAVIS: "That's not real,"

01:04:57.283 --> 01:04:58.283
And then you're in.

01:04:58.283 --> 01:05:00.326
MARISHA: Well, how about this,

01:05:01.633 --> 01:05:03.143
am I going to be team outside?

01:05:03.143 --> 01:05:04.723
LIAM: Yes.

01:05:04.723 --> 01:05:07.433
MARISHA: I got a fuck ton of bottle rockets left.

01:05:07.433 --> 01:05:09.533
TALIESIN: And I'll also say, that way we don't have to

01:05:09.533 --> 01:05:11.513
set off a distraction until one of you

01:05:11.513 --> 01:05:14.060
sends a message saying go go go.

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.235
And we--

01:05:15.235 --> 01:05:16.234
MARISHA: I think that's right; I don't think

01:05:16.234 --> 01:05:18.203
we make a distraction until we really need one.

01:05:18.203 --> 01:05:19.733
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the way to do it.

01:05:19.733 --> 01:05:21.373
LIAM: You could just be a drunk person in the woods

01:05:21.373 --> 01:05:23.313
being an idiot.
TALIESIN: You kind of already are.

01:05:23.313 --> 01:05:25.315
MARISHA: I-- exactly.

01:05:25.315 --> 01:05:26.673
TRAVIS: DM?
MATT: Yes?

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:30.333
TRAVIS: Tree cover, space, outside perimeter,

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:31.243
wrought iron fence.

01:05:31.243 --> 01:05:32.203
SAM: Those are all nouns.

01:05:32.203 --> 01:05:34.183
TRAVIS: What is the distance between the tree cover

01:05:34.183 --> 01:05:36.113
and the wrought iron fence?

01:05:36.113 --> 01:05:37.473
MATT: The distance from the tree cover to the wrought iron

01:05:37.473 --> 01:05:40.903
fence is roughly 15 feet, and it adjusts some places.

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:42.563
Some places it gets a little closer to 10,

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:44.952
but there has been a clearing between the fence

01:05:44.952 --> 01:05:47.053
and the trees so that, in order to get to the fence,

01:05:47.053 --> 01:05:49.183
you are exposed for about 10 to 15 feet depending--

01:05:49.183 --> 01:05:50.381
TRAVIS: So whether we set off bottle rockets

01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:52.733
or a dragon or whatever, if these guards

01:05:52.733 --> 01:05:53.773
are anything with their salt,

01:05:53.773 --> 01:05:55.411
they'll start scanning their sectors.

01:05:55.411 --> 01:05:56.913
We could also do Marine Layer

01:05:56.913 --> 01:05:59.113
and just hide in sort of a cloud of fog,

01:05:59.113 --> 01:06:01.463
those of us that are on Team Outside.

01:06:01.463 --> 01:06:04.224
TALIESIN: How's the weather right now? Would fog be weird?

01:06:06.313 --> 01:06:08.823
MATT: You're far enough north of Rexxentrum to where

01:06:08.823 --> 01:06:11.363
the clouds that were breaking up are still present,

01:06:11.363 --> 01:06:13.433
but it is still a mostly gray sky.

01:06:13.433 --> 01:06:15.463
There isn't a heavy amount of moisture.

01:06:15.463 --> 01:06:18.613
It does not appear to be heavy fog weather necessarily,

01:06:18.613 --> 01:06:20.733
but it wouldn't feel entirely out of place.

01:06:20.733 --> 01:06:22.773
Fog is a common occurrence--

01:06:22.773 --> 01:06:24.543
TRAVIS: And I'd stand in the treeline, not out in the open,

01:06:24.543 --> 01:06:26.243
but just in the trees.

01:06:26.243 --> 01:06:27.503
TALIESIN: Makes sense, makes sense.

01:06:27.503 --> 01:06:29.503
Maybe there's a pond. I don't know if there was a pond.

01:06:29.503 --> 01:06:31.573
SAM: Can we come up with slightly cooler team names

01:06:31.573 --> 01:06:33.403
than Team Inside and Team Outside?

01:06:33.403 --> 01:06:38.403
Like, could it be, like, you know Team Fire Storm and Team--

01:06:38.868 --> 01:06:40.854
TRAVIS: Outtie.
SAM: What?

01:06:40.854 --> 01:06:44.427
TRAVIS: Like an innie and an outtie, like a belly button?

01:06:44.427 --> 01:06:47.043
SAM: Okay, Team Fire Storm and Team Outtie.

01:06:47.043 --> 01:06:51.313
(laughter)

01:06:51.313 --> 01:06:55.434
LIAM: Is that A-U-D-I or O-U-T-T-I-E?
TRAVIS: There's no wrong answer.

01:06:55.434 --> 01:06:57.584
LAURA: So is it just the three of us going in?

01:06:57.584 --> 01:06:59.017
Who's on Team Innie?

01:06:59.017 --> 01:07:00.353
MARISHA: Fjord is on Team Audi.

01:07:00.353 --> 01:07:01.343
SAM: Team Fire Storm!

01:07:01.343 --> 01:07:03.493
LAURA: Who's on Team Fire Storm?

01:07:03.493 --> 01:07:04.873
TRAVIS: Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah?

01:07:04.873 --> 01:07:07.300
TRAVIS: And who else is on Team Fire Storm?

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.746
(laughter)

01:07:08.746 --> 01:07:10.813
LIAM: Jester is coming in now.
TRAVIS: Yep, Jester.

01:07:10.813 --> 01:07:12.053
TALIESIN: I think you three.

01:07:12.053 --> 01:07:12.956
LAURA: Just us three?

01:07:15.663 --> 01:07:16.496
MATT: All right.

01:07:16.496 --> 01:07:19.493
TALIESIN: Unless you want a bruiser.
MATT: Caleb, Jester, and who else?

01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:20.613
SAM: Veth the Brave.

01:07:20.613 --> 01:07:24.203
MARISHA: It just takes both of
your Message people. That's all.

01:07:24.203 --> 01:07:25.785
SAM: I can cast a Message every once

01:07:25.785 --> 01:07:27.853
in a while to check in on the outside.

01:07:27.853 --> 01:07:29.546
LIAM: Ping.
MARISHA: Ping, fine.

01:07:30.703 --> 01:07:32.353
TALIESIN: Do you guys want Freedom of Movement?

01:07:32.353 --> 01:07:33.990
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: I don't know what that is, but sure.

01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:35.604
MARISHA: Cause is that-- it's a cantrip, right? Message?

01:07:35.604 --> 01:07:37.743
SAM: It is.
TALIESIN: Let's burn a bunch of fourths.

01:07:37.743 --> 01:07:39.051
MARISHA: All right.
TRAVIS: If we're going to have code names,

01:07:39.051 --> 01:07:40.873
we should also have code words.

01:07:40.873 --> 01:07:42.143
Something for if it's going well,

01:07:42.143 --> 01:07:43.663
something if it's "oh shit come get us,"

01:07:43.663 --> 01:07:45.413
and something for "we're coming out."

01:07:46.283 --> 01:07:47.836
If it's going bad, we'll say,

01:07:49.003 --> 01:07:51.403
"oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck."

01:07:51.403 --> 01:07:53.466
TRAVIS: It's a code word, like a singular--

01:07:53.466 --> 01:07:54.824
LAURA: Fuck!
TRAVIS: Fuck works.

01:07:54.824 --> 01:07:56.423
LAURA: Is the if it's going bad.

01:07:56.423 --> 01:08:00.223
TALIESIN: Maybe something you don't use as a comma.
LIAM: Depends on the context.

01:08:00.223 --> 01:08:02.481
TRAVIS: You do tend to fuck it up a bit

01:08:02.481 --> 01:08:04.136
when you're messaging.

01:08:04.136 --> 01:08:06.233
It counts for 26% of your words

01:08:06.233 --> 01:08:07.586
when you're doing those spells.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:11.503
TALIESIN: What's something you'd never say?

01:08:12.553 --> 01:08:14.073
MARISHA: Avocado.
TALIESIN: Sarsaparilla.

01:08:14.073 --> 01:08:16.790
LAURA: No, that's-- sarsaparilla I don't say.

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:17.903
TALIESIN: Can you remember that, though?

01:08:17.903 --> 01:08:19.870
LAURA: Yeah, totally.
TRAVIS: Sarsaparilla's good.

01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:22.078
LAURA: It's bad? Sarsaparilla is bad.

01:08:22.078 --> 01:08:23.053
TALIESIN: No, I mean, it's fine if you feel like--

01:08:23.053 --> 01:08:24.302
LAURA: No, but I mean is that what--

01:08:24.302 --> 01:08:25.614
(laughter)

01:08:25.614 --> 01:08:27.527
Is that what I'm saying is bad?

01:08:27.527 --> 01:08:29.285
LIAM: I like sarsaparilla very much.

01:08:29.285 --> 01:08:31.476
LAURA: So sarsaparilla means everything is A-okay.

01:08:31.476 --> 01:08:32.635
LIAM: Yeah, sarsaparilla's good.

01:08:32.635 --> 01:08:33.476
LAURA: Sarsaparilla's good.

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:35.129
TALIESIN: It is.

01:08:35.129 --> 01:08:36.362
Did you ever have it? It's great.

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:37.895
LIAM: How about-- it's an acquired taste,

01:08:37.895 --> 01:08:40.296
but how about licorice is bad.
LAURA: I was going to say licorice for bad!

01:08:40.296 --> 01:08:41.673
LIAM: Cause it's terrible.
LAURA: It's awful.

01:08:41.673 --> 01:08:43.775
LIAM: Who likes licorice?
LAURA: Licorice is bad.

01:08:43.775 --> 01:08:45.000
TALIESIN: Put it in tea, but it's got to be

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.043
covering a bunch of other stuff.

01:08:46.043 --> 01:08:48.453
LAURA: Licorice bad, sarsaparilla good.

01:08:48.453 --> 01:08:49.823
LIAM: Do you really?
LAURA: What is--

01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:51.997
MATT: Like licorice? Yeah, I like licorice.

01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:53.682
MARISHA: I mean I like Jäger.
LIAM: It's like dirt.

01:08:53.682 --> 01:08:56.068
MARISHA: Everyone likes Jägermeister, right?
LIAM: Minty dirt.

01:08:56.068 --> 01:08:57.433
MATT: I love it.

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.889
Like that and anise, yeah, I love that flavor.

01:08:58.889 --> 01:09:01.399
TRAVIS: Get out of here.
LIAM: Well, you can't be perfect.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.273
MARISHA: Jäger bombs.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:04.213
TRAVIS: Shit's medicine.

01:09:04.213 --> 01:09:05.616
LAURA: Licorice is "come save us."

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:07.409
LIAM: Okay.

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:10.878
LAURA: Sarsaparilla is good, licorice
is "come save us," and--

01:09:10.878 --> 01:09:12.743
ASHLEY: Sarsaparilla is like, "hey, things are okay,

01:09:12.743 --> 01:09:13.683
"you're good to go."

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:15.163
TRAVIS: We really don't even need that word.

01:09:15.163 --> 01:09:17.913
It's usually like, if it's good, just shut the fuck up.

01:09:18.986 --> 01:09:21.901
TALIESIN: And then what's "we're leaving at high speed?"

01:09:21.901 --> 01:09:23.223
LAURA: "We're leaving at high-speed" is--

01:09:23.223 --> 01:09:24.953
LIAM: Red hots.
LAURA: Fire Storm.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:27.036
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: Red hots.

01:09:27.036 --> 01:09:28.119
TALIESIN: Red hot, red hot.

01:09:28.119 --> 01:09:30.013
LIAM: Red hot.
TALIESIN: Red hot, fun to say.

01:09:30.013 --> 01:09:30.846
LAURA: Red hot.

01:09:30.846 --> 01:09:32.552
MARISHA: Are we going to remember all-- wait, sarsaparilla--

01:09:32.552 --> 01:09:33.747
TALIESIN: Sarsaparilla, licorice, red hot.

01:09:33.747 --> 01:09:35.683
LIAM: I feel like this is overly complicated.

01:09:35.683 --> 01:09:37.039
MARISHA: It is.

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:40.886
TRAVIS: Look, we are doing right
by the Cerberus Assembly, okay?

01:09:40.886 --> 01:09:42.933
We're giving them our best.

01:09:42.933 --> 01:09:44.673
It's just sad this is our best.

01:09:44.673 --> 01:09:47.233
LIAM: Now, Jester, when you paint,

01:09:47.233 --> 01:09:48.959
don't paint like a Looney Tunes hole.

01:09:48.959 --> 01:09:50.059
LAURA: I'm not going to--

01:09:50.059 --> 01:09:52.033
LIAM: Well, I have a suggestion.
I'm sure you have great ideas,

01:09:52.033 --> 01:09:55.293
but I was thinking of like a little gray curtain

01:09:55.293 --> 01:09:58.903
the same color as the wall that's low to the ground.

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:02.620
That way, once we go through, the curtain just stays.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.546
LAURA: Caleb, I don't know if you
know how these paints work,

01:10:04.546 --> 01:10:06.003
but here's the thing.

01:10:06.003 --> 01:10:07.826
If I paint a little gray curtain--

01:10:07.826 --> 01:10:09.383
LIAM: With the little gaps.

01:10:09.383 --> 01:10:11.193
LAURA: If I paint a little gray curtain,

01:10:11.193 --> 01:10:13.523
when we pull it aside, there will still be wall.

01:10:13.523 --> 01:10:15.613
LIAM: No, no, you paint just the barest little bit

01:10:15.613 --> 01:10:17.605
of hole that you would only see if you are close.

01:10:17.605 --> 01:10:18.723
You have to do details.

01:10:18.723 --> 01:10:20.563
LAURA: This will take a lot longer.

01:10:20.563 --> 01:10:23.753
SAM: Yeah, a black hole is just real easy.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:25.283
It's one color.

01:10:25.283 --> 01:10:26.661
LAURA: Yeah, I can do a--

01:10:27.753 --> 01:10:29.333
I'll make it look like a crack.

01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:33.183
Like the tower is just falling apart.

01:10:33.183 --> 01:10:34.223
LIAM: And some tall grass.

01:10:34.223 --> 01:10:35.322
LAURA: And some tall grass.
LIAM: In front of it

01:10:35.322 --> 01:10:37.533
and low to the ground. Like we
have to-- we'll crawl through it.

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:38.823
LAURA: Yes, of course, Caleb.

01:10:38.823 --> 01:10:40.413
SAM: Just a, just a black circle.

01:10:40.413 --> 01:10:42.255
LAURA: I'm a talented painter, so--

01:10:42.255 --> 01:10:43.243
LIAM: We're already at licorice,

01:10:43.243 --> 01:10:45.159
licorice, licorice.
TRAVIS: It's perfectly manicured grounds

01:10:45.159 --> 01:10:47.418
except for this one tuft of tall grass

01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:48.426
in front of a crack.

01:10:50.263 --> 01:10:51.843
Jeb is fired.

01:10:51.843 --> 01:10:54.353
MARISHA: Licorice is bad--
ASHLEY: But I cut the grass!

01:10:54.353 --> 01:10:55.186
TALIESIN: Bad on the outside.

01:10:55.186 --> 01:10:58.233
MARISHA: Is it-- wait, is it a different kind of bad?

01:10:58.233 --> 01:10:59.700
TALIESIN: Yeah, licorice is "come save us,"

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.892
red hot is "we're coming out."

01:11:00.892 --> 01:11:03.213
TRAVIS: Also, are there any windows in this tower,

01:11:03.213 --> 01:11:05.259
like, are we ignoring obvious points of entry

01:11:05.259 --> 01:11:06.393
that we could just, I don't know,

01:11:06.393 --> 01:11:07.675
open a window and go in?

01:11:07.675 --> 01:11:09.983
LIAM: No, no, no, we're not, we're not doing tower at all.

01:11:09.983 --> 01:11:12.663
We're going into a solid wall to go

01:11:12.663 --> 01:11:14.303
into that vestibule with the stairs.

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:15.710
TRAVIS: There's no windows--
MATT: There's no windows on that side.

01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:16.717
TRAVIS: Okay, just making sure.

01:11:16.717 --> 01:11:18.195
LAURA: I thought we were going to--

01:11:18.195 --> 01:11:19.243
TRAVIS: Just asking the questions.

01:11:19.243 --> 01:11:22.756
LIAM: Where those teeth are? Just below the teeth.

01:11:22.756 --> 01:11:25.753
LAURA: I can't, I don't know where my light is going.

01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:26.683
LIAM: Nope.

01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:28.633
MATT: Wait, on this side?

01:11:28.633 --> 01:11:29.743
LIAM: Nope, other side.

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:30.576
MATT: Here?

01:11:30.576 --> 01:11:32.863
LIAM: Almost. Now go towards the stairs.

01:11:32.863 --> 01:11:33.745
ASHLEY: To the right?

01:11:33.745 --> 01:11:35.492
LIAM: That wall. Yep, you just went to the wall

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:36.843
we want to paint a hole in.

01:11:36.843 --> 01:11:38.418
MATT: And you're trying to paint a hole in this wall?

01:11:38.418 --> 01:11:39.251
LIAM: Yes.

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:41.213
MATT: So where's the Gate coming in?

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:43.543
LIAM: There, facing that wall.

01:11:43.543 --> 01:11:46.413
MATT: Just so you know, this is all the inside.

01:11:46.413 --> 01:11:48.713
You guys are outside the perimeter wall here and here.

01:11:48.713 --> 01:11:49.689
LAURA: So we don't see that.

01:11:49.689 --> 01:11:52.425
MATT: You don't see the other interior of this.
LAURA: Okay, we were very confused.

01:11:52.425 --> 01:11:54.943
LIAM: I asked-- well, I thought--

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:56.493
Everything's invisible so it's hard, but--

01:11:56.493 --> 01:11:58.753
MATT: No, fair enough, this is the south side.

01:11:58.753 --> 01:12:00.293
You guys are on this side of the fence

01:12:00.293 --> 01:12:01.853
and you traveled around this space.

01:12:01.853 --> 01:12:04.583
So you haven't had an angle yet where you can really see--

01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:06.323
LIAM: In that--
MATT: -- in that end.

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:08.293
I thought you were going to the back wall here,

01:12:08.293 --> 01:12:09.126
I misunderstood.

01:12:09.126 --> 01:12:11.473
LIAM: That's still better than square one.

01:12:11.473 --> 01:12:15.213
LAURA: Okay, so let's go into the wall.

01:12:15.213 --> 01:12:16.046
We'll aim for the middle,

01:12:16.046 --> 01:12:17.718
so it'll be right across from that doorway.

01:12:17.718 --> 01:12:18.576
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:12:18.576 --> 01:12:20.883
TALIESIN: You could also get that little--

01:12:20.883 --> 01:12:22.695
why am I doing it there?

01:12:22.695 --> 01:12:24.769
(laughter)

01:12:24.769 --> 01:12:27.126
That little-- this is not helping. There we go.

01:12:27.126 --> 01:12:29.481
That little edge between the tower and the wall,

01:12:29.481 --> 01:12:30.887
so you have like a little--

01:12:30.887 --> 01:12:32.623
TRAVIS: Did you hit the TV?

01:12:32.623 --> 01:12:34.501
TALIESIN: Of course I hit the TV!

01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:35.673
LIAM: You got to take that point back, Tal.

01:12:35.673 --> 01:12:37.099
What'd you say?

01:12:37.099 --> 01:12:38.463
(laughter)

01:12:38.463 --> 01:12:39.583
MARISHA: I knew what he was talking about.

01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:40.733
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:12:40.733 --> 01:12:42.823
LIAM: I just knew you were lasering a large screen TV.

01:12:42.823 --> 01:12:44.824
TRAVIS: "Why am I doing it there?"

01:12:44.824 --> 01:12:46.313
TALIESIN: I'm trying to distract people who are watching

01:12:46.313 --> 01:12:48.588
an X-Men movie. Okay, there's a--

01:12:48.588 --> 01:12:50.413
ASHLEY: I like that you were holding it up high.

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:52.973
Like, "I got it".

01:12:52.973 --> 01:12:56.240
TALIESIN: So but-- there's the square--

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.493
The square in the tower and like getting right

01:12:57.493 --> 01:12:59.630
in the corner there.
MARISHA: He's suggesting this pocket.

01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:01.848
MATT: Yeah, this edge right there.
MARISHA: Is what he's suggesting.

01:13:01.848 --> 01:13:04.433
SAM: Well, that's a good pocket.
MARISHA: Because then you have cover from the tower.

01:13:04.433 --> 01:13:05.621
TRAVIS: That'll be good when there are three people

01:13:05.621 --> 01:13:07.924
in that hallway.
LIAM: That's even better. Yeah, great.

01:13:07.924 --> 01:13:10.844
Refining, refining, you're red hot.

01:13:10.844 --> 01:13:13.441
Wait, no, I don't mean that, I don't mean that!

01:13:13.441 --> 01:13:14.274
MATT: So what's the plan?

01:13:14.274 --> 01:13:16.442
SAM: Okay, that's what we're doing.
LIAM: That's good, that's great.

01:13:16.442 --> 01:13:18.485
Yeah, we'll do in that little crack.

01:13:18.485 --> 01:13:21.943
MATT: Right there, you have very easy visual of that edge.

01:13:21.943 --> 01:13:24.166
TRAVIS: And Team Fire Storm, when you get in that hallway

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.673
and there are three guards or at least two posted up

01:13:26.673 --> 01:13:28.513
at either in your plan is to?

01:13:28.513 --> 01:13:30.073
LIAM: Fuck them up.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:32.083
LAURA: I'm going to try to charm the shit out of them.

01:13:32.083 --> 01:13:32.916
SAM: Good call.

01:13:32.916 --> 01:13:34.633
LIAM: Fuck them up with charm.

01:13:34.633 --> 01:13:36.352
TRAVIS: Love it, I just wanted to make sure we were--

01:13:36.352 --> 01:13:38.090
LAURA: And if the charm doesn't work--

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:39.726
LIAM: Oh, I will be ready.

01:13:39.726 --> 01:13:41.353
TALIESIN: I have an emergency Calm Emotions, too,

01:13:41.353 --> 01:13:42.186
if things get weird.

01:13:42.186 --> 01:13:43.019
LIAM: Oh good.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:44.783
LAURA: That's good.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:13:44.783 --> 01:13:46.993
LAURA: And all of us will be able to see in

01:13:46.993 --> 01:13:49.345
right after I maybe paint this hole.

01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:52.028
TALIESIN: Yeah, and if I use it don't anyone attack anybody.

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:54.503
TRAVIS: Are you on Team Fire Storm also?

01:13:54.503 --> 01:13:57.352
TALIESIN: (stuttering) No, I'm an outtie.

01:13:57.352 --> 01:13:58.439
TRAVIS: Team Outtie.

01:13:58.439 --> 01:14:03.381
(laughter)

01:14:04.283 --> 01:14:05.373
TALIESIN: You did this.

01:14:08.775 --> 01:14:10.677
TRAVIS: Caduceus is killing me today.

01:14:10.677 --> 01:14:13.080
(laughter)

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.580
LAURA: Are you casting the doorway?

01:14:15.533 --> 01:14:16.943
TRAVIS: Whenever you're-- whenever--

01:14:16.943 --> 01:14:17.776
LAURA: My paints are ready.

01:14:17.776 --> 01:14:19.333
I'm picking out the paints

01:14:19.333 --> 01:14:21.813
that are the colors of the walls that I see

01:14:21.813 --> 01:14:23.378
and I got my green ready.

01:14:23.378 --> 01:14:24.923
SAM: Before we go in, Caleb, come here.

01:14:24.923 --> 01:14:26.525
LIAM: Yeah, okay?

01:14:26.525 --> 01:14:30.273
SAM: When we were at Allura's, she gave me some insight,

01:14:30.273 --> 01:14:32.633
some magical insight on how to protect you

01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:33.583
at all costs.

01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:36.253
So I'd like to cast-- I'd like to send you

01:14:36.253 --> 01:14:38.683
to your mind palace, if you can,

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:40.303
to your intellectual fortress.

01:14:40.303 --> 01:14:43.726
And I will cast Intellect Fortress on you.

01:14:45.623 --> 01:14:46.456
It's a good one.

01:14:47.493 --> 01:14:48.596
LIAM: Tickles my brain.

01:14:48.596 --> 01:14:49.968
SAM: Yes.

01:14:49.968 --> 01:14:51.783
LIAM: And it does what again?

01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:53.333
MATT: As you're contemplating this,

01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:54.993
to just clarify with you

01:14:54.993 --> 01:14:56.343
about how the paints function.

01:14:56.343 --> 01:14:57.176
LAURA: Yeah.

01:14:58.513 --> 01:15:01.293
MATT: Just painting a black hole

01:15:01.293 --> 01:15:03.143
isn't going to put a hole in the wall.

01:15:03.143 --> 01:15:04.888
LAURA: No, I know, I need to paint--

01:15:04.888 --> 01:15:06.103
MATT: You you have to Wile E Coyote it.

01:15:06.103 --> 01:15:08.443
LAURA: Yeah, I know, I need to
make it look like an actual hole.

01:15:08.443 --> 01:15:12.183
MATT: Correct, you do not know what the interior looks like.

01:15:14.263 --> 01:15:17.123
LIAM: What about a trap door, like a hinge?

01:15:17.123 --> 01:15:19.738
MATT: A hinged door or something like that is more viable.

01:15:19.738 --> 01:15:21.603
LAURA: Okay I'll do that, then.
MATT: Meaning-- just saying, like,

01:15:21.603 --> 01:15:22.923
in order to make the hole functioning,

01:15:22.923 --> 01:15:25.303
you have to paint what the inside

01:15:25.303 --> 01:15:26.543
would look like from that perspective

01:15:26.543 --> 01:15:27.943
in order to make it punch through,

01:15:27.943 --> 01:15:29.313
which you could do

01:15:29.313 --> 01:15:32.333
if you knew what the inside looked
like. That's the challenge.

01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:33.513
LAURA: Got it.

01:15:33.513 --> 01:15:34.443
MATT: When you painted a hole

01:15:34.443 --> 01:15:36.545
through the rocks to exit, you had a perspective

01:15:36.545 --> 01:15:37.673
of what was on the other side

01:15:37.673 --> 01:15:38.943
and you could fake it.

01:15:38.943 --> 01:15:40.873
LAURA: Right, I did it to the chapel, too.

01:15:40.873 --> 01:15:42.623
Oops, a long time ago.

01:15:42.623 --> 01:15:44.203
MATT: Probably, well.

01:15:44.203 --> 01:15:45.560
LAURA: What are you going to do?

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.378
Now I know better, though, and once you know--

01:15:48.378 --> 01:15:49.293
TRAVIS: That's half the battle.

01:15:49.293 --> 01:15:50.603
LAURA: The paints work differently.

01:15:50.603 --> 01:15:52.866
It's like Garden of Eden shit, you know?

01:15:55.643 --> 01:15:58.916
Okay, then I'm going to paint a teeny tiny gray--

01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:00.853
MATT: Well, the chapel had windows. You were able to see--

01:16:00.853 --> 01:16:02.023
LAURA: Oh, good call.

01:16:02.023 --> 01:16:04.931
I'm going to paint a teeny tiny

01:16:04.931 --> 01:16:08.122
gray wooden door.

01:16:08.122 --> 01:16:11.213
So it's really old wood that looks gray.
MATT: Right.

01:16:11.213 --> 01:16:14.893
LAURA: That's got the hinges on it, so we can lift it up.

01:16:14.893 --> 01:16:16.985
It's a lift-y one.
MATT: You got it.

01:16:16.985 --> 01:16:19.643
LIAM: Paint a little bit of grease on the hinges.

01:16:19.643 --> 01:16:20.683
TALIESIN: Let me know when you
guys are about to open the door.

01:16:20.683 --> 01:16:22.583
LAURA: Yeah, so it won't be squeaky.
TALIESIN: I'm ready.

01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:27.583
TRAVIS: Well, we have to do distraction, Gate, paint.

01:16:27.593 --> 01:16:29.660
MARISHA: Do we need--
LAURA: No, no distraction, no distraction.

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:30.843
MARISHA: Not yet, only if needed.

01:16:30.843 --> 01:16:31.953
ASHLEY: That's an emergency.

01:16:31.953 --> 01:16:33.883
TRAVIS: Okay, ready for the Gate?

01:16:33.883 --> 01:16:34.769
LAURA: Yeah.

01:16:34.769 --> 01:16:36.632
LIAM: And the distraction will be--

01:16:36.632 --> 01:16:39.493
SAM: That's for Team Outtie to figure out.

01:16:39.493 --> 01:16:41.003
LIAM: Well.

01:16:41.003 --> 01:16:42.943
MARISHA: You're sure you want all of us on this outside

01:16:42.943 --> 01:16:44.313
of the fence. You don't--

01:16:44.313 --> 01:16:46.253
I can try and get on top of the tower.

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:48.403
TRAVIS: To be clear, the only ones with Major Image,

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.503
creature distraction that can be far, far, far away

01:16:50.503 --> 01:16:52.243
are he and I, and once I cast the Gate,

01:16:52.243 --> 01:16:53.333
that's it for 10 minutes.

01:16:53.333 --> 01:16:55.113
If I cast something else, Gate goes away.

01:16:55.113 --> 01:16:58.433
SAM: But there's other distractions that they can just do.

01:16:58.433 --> 01:17:00.783
TRAVIS: Physically, but they'll have to (running noises).

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:04.583
MARISHA: Matt, does it feel like I
could climb on top of this tower?

01:17:04.583 --> 01:17:05.628
MATT: You?
MARISHA: Could I scale it?

01:17:05.628 --> 01:17:06.973
MATT: Yeah, you could totally do that.

01:17:06.973 --> 01:17:07.856
MARISHA: And does it look like-- you said

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:11.100
it's got a crenelated edge to where I could get down?

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:11.939
LAURA: It could be--

01:17:11.939 --> 01:17:13.467
MATT: You don't know what the top looks like, but--

01:17:13.467 --> 01:17:14.550
LAURA: -- completely magicked, though,

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:17.113
to where like you touch it, something happens.

01:17:17.113 --> 01:17:18.471
MARISHA: Huh?
LIAM: That could be.

01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:19.304
LAURA: You know what I mean?

01:17:19.304 --> 01:17:20.853
Like there could be like magic effects on it.

01:17:20.853 --> 01:17:22.536
So if you touch the outside,

01:17:23.753 --> 01:17:26.943
people will know. It trips the alarm.

01:17:26.943 --> 01:17:29.583
LIAM: Were all your bottle rockets--
MARISHA: But I mean yeah you're painting the door.

01:17:29.583 --> 01:17:30.643
LIAM: Beauregard?
MARISHA: Huh?

01:17:30.643 --> 01:17:32.643
LIAM: Were all your bottle rockets in--?

01:17:32.643 --> 01:17:33.476
SAM: She has them.

01:17:33.476 --> 01:17:36.713
MARISHA: Oh, I keep my bottle rockets on me.

01:17:36.713 --> 01:17:40.113
LIAM: Okay. Where? You're so sveltely dressed and packed?

01:17:40.113 --> 01:17:41.073
MARISHA: I have lots of pouches.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:43.793
LIAM: Okay. They're furry, okay.

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:45.783
TALIESIN: Who doesn't have pouches?

01:17:45.783 --> 01:17:48.513
SAM: Caleb, for an hour you have advantage on intelligence,

01:17:48.513 --> 01:17:50.669
wisdom, and charisma saving throws.

01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:52.243
(exclaiming)

01:17:52.243 --> 01:17:55.036
SAM: And you are resistant to psychic damage.

01:17:56.303 --> 01:17:58.001
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:17:58.001 --> 01:17:59.243
LAURA: Damn.

01:17:59.243 --> 01:18:01.483
MATT: It is concentration, so to keep that in mind.

01:18:01.483 --> 01:18:02.316
SAM: What'd you say?

01:18:02.316 --> 01:18:03.668
MATT: It is concentration, so keep that in mind.

01:18:03.668 --> 01:18:05.953
SAM: Okay, good to know. It is?

01:18:05.953 --> 01:18:06.786
MATT: Yes.

01:18:08.073 --> 01:18:13.073
All right, so.

01:18:13.183 --> 01:18:16.003
LIAM: You're team distract-- you're distraction then, right?

01:18:16.003 --> 01:18:17.363
MARISHA: Only if needed, but I--

01:18:17.363 --> 01:18:18.221
LIAM: If needed.

01:18:18.221 --> 01:18:19.603
MARISHA: I feel like I can get on top of this tower

01:18:19.603 --> 01:18:23.133
and at least scout and, like, be a lookout.

01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:28.133
LIAM: Sure, so you could ping
Beauregard for a lay of the land.

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:35.626
Okay.

01:18:37.423 --> 01:18:38.683
All right, so we'll leave

01:18:38.683 --> 01:18:41.103
just a foot of space between your door

01:18:41.103 --> 01:18:43.273
and the wall, so that Beauregard has enough room

01:18:43.273 --> 01:18:45.433
to not go right in?

01:18:45.433 --> 01:18:47.553
MARISHA: Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

01:18:47.553 --> 01:18:48.413
LIAM: No, I know, I just don't want you

01:18:48.413 --> 01:18:50.586
flush against the wall when you appear there.

01:18:52.533 --> 01:18:53.853
Okay.

01:18:53.853 --> 01:18:55.303
TALIESIN: Freedom of Movement, Freedom of Movement,

01:18:55.303 --> 01:18:57.461
Freedom of Movement, Guidance.

01:18:57.461 --> 01:18:58.294
LAURA: Ooh!

01:18:59.243 --> 01:19:02.683
LIAM: And remind me what Freedom of Movement gives us all?

01:19:02.683 --> 01:19:05.243
Can't be paralyzed or grappled or--?

01:19:05.243 --> 01:19:08.483
TALIESIN: Yeah, "unaffected by difficult terrain,

01:19:08.483 --> 01:19:10.063
"spells and other magical effects can neither

01:19:10.063 --> 01:19:11.983
"reduce the target's speed nor cause the target

01:19:11.983 --> 01:19:13.516
"to be paralyzed or restrained.

01:19:14.943 --> 01:19:16.743
"You can spend five feet of movement to automatically

01:19:16.743 --> 01:19:18.453
"escape from non magical restraints,

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:21.103
"such as manacles or creatures that have grappled you."

01:19:21.103 --> 01:19:23.103
And just in case, your underwater speed

01:19:23.103 --> 01:19:25.303
is now your walking speed.

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:26.602
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Just in case.

01:19:26.602 --> 01:19:28.003
MARISHA: Who's getting Freedom of Movement?

01:19:28.003 --> 01:19:29.663
TALIESIN: All three of them. I'm burning my fourths.

01:19:29.663 --> 01:19:30.863
SAM: Team Fire Storm.

01:19:30.863 --> 01:19:31.696
MATT: There you go.

01:19:31.696 --> 01:19:33.123
MARISHA: And is all of Team Outtie

01:19:33.123 --> 01:19:35.963
staying on the outside of the fence?

01:19:35.963 --> 01:19:38.103
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Except for me.

01:19:38.103 --> 01:19:40.743
LIAM: That's good, that's three in, one midway,

01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:42.863
and three on the outside.
MARISHA: And then three on the outside.

01:19:42.863 --> 01:19:45.653
So if I need to communicate anything,

01:19:45.653 --> 01:19:46.946
I'll try to look at you.

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:51.743
For some baseball signals.

01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:52.823
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:19:52.823 --> 01:19:53.656
TALIESIN: Got it, too.

01:19:55.903 --> 01:19:56.736
TRAVIS: All right.
LAURA: I feel like

01:19:56.736 --> 01:19:57.727
this is Beau jumping into

01:19:57.727 --> 01:20:00.163
the middle of three of the Tomb Takers, but okay.

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:01.053
LIAM: Wait a minute,

01:20:01.053 --> 01:20:03.783
all of you do 60 seconds of planning.

01:20:03.783 --> 01:20:05.845
I have to go to the bathroom so badly

01:20:05.845 --> 01:20:07.526
and I did not want to do it.
LAURA: Oh my god, me, too!

01:20:07.526 --> 01:20:08.585
TALIESIN: We're all dying.

01:20:08.585 --> 01:20:09.418
TRAVIS: I have a question

01:20:09.418 --> 01:20:10.251
for Matt, anyway.
MATT: Hey!

01:20:10.251 --> 01:20:11.159
We can take an early break?

01:20:11.159 --> 01:20:14.133
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that, let's do that.

01:20:14.133 --> 01:20:17.183
MATT: As you prepare for this mission

01:20:17.183 --> 01:20:18.833
into the sanatorium, we're going to go ahead

01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:19.693
and take an early break.

01:20:19.693 --> 01:20:21.703
So we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.

01:20:21.703 --> 01:20:22.584
LIAM: It'd be really cool if--

01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:24.602
Critter Hug is that lighthouse,

01:20:24.602 --> 01:20:28.214
that beacon of just warm, good, fuzzy feelings,

01:20:28.214 --> 01:20:31.384
that even when every Wednesday is historical event,

01:20:31.384 --> 01:20:35.174
we still have this awesome platform and space

01:20:35.174 --> 01:20:38.324
to just dedicate to pure, wholesome good love,

01:20:38.324 --> 01:20:41.084
and send out those vibes to people who really deserve it.

01:20:41.084 --> 01:20:45.254
And I feel like that's my purpose on this planet

01:20:45.254 --> 01:20:48.357
is to just make sure that people who need love, get love.

01:20:49.204 --> 01:20:50.054
You know?
I like that.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.054
Yeah.
Thank you.

01:20:51.054 --> 01:20:52.254
Thank you. (laughs)

01:20:52.254 --> 01:20:54.104
I'm happy to be right beside you getting there

01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:55.406
on your coattails.

01:20:55.406 --> 01:20:56.764
I'm on your-

01:20:56.764 --> 01:21:00.504
Sir, we're on to cocoa tails is that-?

01:21:00.504 --> 01:21:02.275
There we go, cocoa tails?

01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:05.087
I want cocoa coat tails, that sounds delicious.

01:21:05.087 --> 01:21:07.094
It's like I'm wearing half of a sleeve

01:21:07.094 --> 01:21:08.454
and then sitting on your coat tail,

01:21:08.454 --> 01:21:10.304
and then you're wearing the other half of the sleeve

01:21:10.304 --> 01:21:11.964
and then sitting on my coat tail.

01:21:11.964 --> 01:21:12.797
There you go.

01:21:12.797 --> 01:21:14.204
We're probably gonna trip and fall a lot, but you know.

01:21:14.204 --> 01:21:15.154
It's a coat ouroboros?

01:21:15.154 --> 01:21:16.011
Just kind of-?

01:21:18.034 --> 01:21:19.924
I was thinking coat human centipede

01:21:19.924 --> 01:21:21.315
but that's where my mind was going.

01:21:21.315 --> 01:21:22.148
Wha-?

01:21:22.148 --> 01:21:23.164
I know, I'm sorry.

01:21:23.164 --> 01:21:23.997
Wow!

01:21:23.997 --> 01:21:26.564
(lively singing)

01:22:13.766 --> 01:22:16.033
LAURA: Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:22:16.033 --> 01:22:18.690
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role's shop.

01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:20.420
(upbeat music)

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:22.033
Ooh, look at this.

01:22:22.033 --> 01:22:23.856
Look at the details, ooh.

01:22:25.943 --> 01:22:29.626
Roll an investigation if you want, it's basically perfect.

01:22:31.753 --> 01:22:34.263
I mean the traveler always says impulse purchases

01:22:34.263 --> 01:22:35.516
are a good decision.

01:22:37.613 --> 01:22:39.013
Go ahead, darling.

01:22:39.013 --> 01:22:39.846
Treat yourself.

01:22:42.947 --> 01:22:45.614
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

01:22:49.063 --> 01:22:51.360
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

01:22:53.183 --> 01:22:55.466
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

01:22:56.363 --> 01:22:58.273
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

01:22:58.273 --> 01:22:59.354
You still got time.

01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:02.771
(upbeat music continues)

01:23:01.967 --> 01:23:04.467
(jazzy music)

01:23:06.617 --> 01:23:09.972
Hello everyone, it's me, Marisha Ray,

01:23:09.972 --> 01:23:12.722
Creative Director for Critical Role content.

01:23:12.722 --> 01:23:14.842
And I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

01:23:14.842 --> 01:23:17.922
about how much we appreciate your support.

01:23:17.922 --> 01:23:22.322
No frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

01:23:22.322 --> 01:23:23.482
Over the past five years

01:23:23.482 --> 01:23:26.172
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos

01:23:26.172 --> 01:23:29.602
in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

01:23:29.602 --> 01:23:33.394
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor, cheap costumes,

01:23:33.394 --> 01:23:35.632
and putting our loyal employees

01:23:35.632 --> 01:23:37.482
in slightly embarrassing situations,

01:23:37.482 --> 01:23:40.642
eagerly, hoping that we've captured your attention.

01:23:40.642 --> 01:23:44.142
Today I am not resorting to edgelord jokes

01:23:44.142 --> 01:23:46.702
written by Brian W. Foster

01:23:46.702 --> 01:23:48.762
or dressing Sam as a celebrity

01:23:48.762 --> 01:23:52.632
to recreate an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

01:23:52.632 --> 01:23:55.592
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account

01:23:55.592 --> 01:23:58.422
requires you to resubscribe each month.

01:23:58.422 --> 01:24:02.619
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

01:24:02.619 --> 01:24:03.832
or have to put Matt in cosplay

01:24:03.832 --> 01:24:06.582
to tell you that you can easily gift subscriptions

01:24:06.582 --> 01:24:09.062
to fellow critters if you're feeling generous.

01:24:09.062 --> 01:24:12.932
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days

01:24:12.932 --> 01:24:14.972
shooting complicated parody promos

01:24:14.972 --> 01:24:17.972
featuring Taliesin Jaffe is a vintage spooky boy

01:24:17.972 --> 01:24:20.302
in full monochromatic glory,

01:24:20.302 --> 01:24:24.195
all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub.

01:24:25.282 --> 01:24:26.425
But not today.

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:30.555
No weird graphics, no puppet murder,

01:24:32.172 --> 01:24:33.205
No Sam Riegal.

01:24:37.182 --> 01:24:38.052
It's just me

01:24:39.232 --> 01:24:40.095
here to say,

01:24:41.252 --> 01:24:42.085
thank you.

01:24:43.312 --> 01:24:44.145
Love you all.

01:24:45.425 --> 01:24:46.575
Good night.

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:50.166
(jazzy music)

01:37:30.117 --> 01:37:34.587
MATT: Welcome back. After that brief earlier interlude.

01:37:34.612 --> 01:37:37.602
So, Mighty Nein, as you are all positioned

01:37:37.602 --> 01:37:39.552
on the northwestern exterior of the perimeter fence

01:37:39.552 --> 01:37:42.592
within the Pearlbow Wilderness, staring into the grounds

01:37:42.592 --> 01:37:43.825
of the Vergesson Sanitorium--

01:37:43.825 --> 01:37:45.975
SAM: Are you saying the Provo, Probo?
MATT: Pearlbow.

01:37:45.975 --> 01:37:46.808
SAM: Okay.

01:37:46.808 --> 01:37:47.641
TRAVIS: Purbo!

01:37:47.641 --> 01:37:48.697
MATT: Pearlbow.
TRAVIS: Pearlbow.

01:37:48.697 --> 01:37:49.705
SAM: Ready, I'm ready.

01:37:49.705 --> 01:37:50.538
MATT: The Provolone Wilderness.

01:37:50.538 --> 01:37:51.371
LIAM: Plobo.

01:37:52.205 --> 01:37:53.038
ASHLEY: Probowl.

01:37:53.038 --> 01:37:54.142
MATT: What would you like to do?

01:37:54.142 --> 01:37:55.750
TRAVIS: As a point of clarification--
MATT: Yes?

01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:57.622
TRAVIS: Treeline to fence, 15 to 20 yards.

01:37:57.622 --> 01:38:00.139
From fence to structure is about 60 yards.

01:38:00.139 --> 01:38:01.105
LAURA and MATT: Feet.

01:38:01.105 --> 01:38:04.397
TRAVIS: Sorry, feet, feet, feet.

01:38:04.397 --> 01:38:08.072
And that border, that 60-foot border is along this edge

01:38:08.072 --> 01:38:09.842
and the other side as well.

01:38:09.842 --> 01:38:11.112
MATT: Yeah, roughly 60 feet.

01:38:11.112 --> 01:38:14.482
Along this side, this edge is probably closer to 70,

01:38:14.482 --> 01:38:17.682
but it's-- this specific structure is nestled

01:38:17.682 --> 01:38:18.515
in the corner.

01:38:18.515 --> 01:38:20.552
TRAVIS: From the guards that we can see that are patrolling,

01:38:20.552 --> 01:38:24.102
do they seem like they walk that 60-foot space

01:38:24.102 --> 01:38:26.812
between the wrought iron and the structures

01:38:26.812 --> 01:38:28.112
in a full circle?

01:38:28.112 --> 01:38:29.495
MATT: The ones you see right now,

01:38:29.495 --> 01:38:32.162
they do not appear to be on that path, but--

01:38:32.162 --> 01:38:32.995
TRAVIS: More on the inner?

01:38:32.995 --> 01:38:35.472
MATT: But who knows if they will, you know?

01:38:35.472 --> 01:38:36.305
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:38:36.305 --> 01:38:37.602
MATT: You would know from--

01:38:38.982 --> 01:38:40.442
LIAM: (whispering) I think you
and I can burn the building down.

01:38:40.442 --> 01:38:41.732
MATT: You would assume that they probably,

01:38:41.732 --> 01:38:42.942
at some point, have to.

01:38:42.942 --> 01:38:44.562
TRAVIS: I'll err on the side of caution

01:38:44.562 --> 01:38:46.512
and I will adjust all of us

01:38:46.512 --> 01:38:49.752
to shift more towards the corner,

01:38:49.752 --> 01:38:51.472
so that from wherever we are in the tree line,

01:38:51.472 --> 01:38:55.232
we can see down the edge of the building ahead of us

01:38:55.232 --> 01:38:56.832
and along the side.

01:38:56.832 --> 01:38:57.665
LIAM: Both sides.
MATT: Okay.

01:38:57.665 --> 01:38:59.172
TRAVIS: 45, so you can see both.

01:38:59.172 --> 01:39:02.082
There is the ability to turn the gate

01:39:02.082 --> 01:39:04.752
as a bonus action, so we can turn it.

01:39:04.752 --> 01:39:07.392
So if somebody moves over here, I turn it

01:39:07.392 --> 01:39:08.564
so they can't see it.

01:39:08.564 --> 01:39:09.782
MARISHA: Oh shit!

01:39:09.782 --> 01:39:10.682
TRAVIS: Once per term.

01:39:10.682 --> 01:39:11.662
MARISHA: Cool.

01:39:11.662 --> 01:39:14.302
TALIESIN: What?
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:39:14.302 --> 01:39:15.202
LIAM: Just got better.

01:39:16.503 --> 01:39:18.072
TALIESIN: What?

01:39:18.072 --> 01:39:19.312
MATT: Okay.

01:39:19.312 --> 01:39:22.642
So everyone has their Freedom of Movements cast.

01:39:22.642 --> 01:39:24.682
One hour, situated in that

01:39:24.682 --> 01:39:26.532
without concentration, which is good.

01:39:29.882 --> 01:39:30.743
What are we doing?

01:39:30.743 --> 01:39:32.070
TRAVIS: Are you ready?

01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:34.052
MARISHA: Caduceus, I'm assuming you don't have anything

01:39:34.052 --> 01:39:37.862
that would help me be more stealthy, not be seen,

01:39:37.862 --> 01:39:39.214
anything cool?

01:39:39.214 --> 01:39:40.892
TRAVIS: I'm not going to do Marine Layer just yet,

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:42.695
Team Outtie, because we don't need it.

01:39:42.695 --> 01:39:43.528
MARISHA: Copy.

01:39:43.528 --> 01:39:45.267
TRAVIS: I just burped and it was so bad.

01:39:45.267 --> 01:39:48.717
(laughter)

01:39:48.717 --> 01:39:50.622
ASHLEY: That's your Marine Layer.

01:39:50.622 --> 01:39:51.771
SAM: Marine Layer?

01:39:51.771 --> 01:39:53.612
(laughter)

01:39:53.612 --> 01:39:54.620
TRAVIS: Wow.
SAM: Sardine layer.

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.964
LAURA: I hope it doesn't drift this direction.

01:39:56.964 --> 01:39:57.872
TRAVIS: That was a cloud.

01:39:57.872 --> 01:39:58.732
MARISHA: That's okay, I'm good.

01:39:58.732 --> 01:40:00.212
MATT: Watched your Reed Richards get grayer.

01:40:00.212 --> 01:40:01.952
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:40:01.952 --> 01:40:03.432
One of my eyes is a little foggy.

01:40:03.432 --> 01:40:05.544
(laughter)

01:40:05.544 --> 01:40:06.377
TRAVIS: Ooh.
LAURA: Okay.

01:40:06.377 --> 01:40:07.393
TRAVIS: You know when you get the root beer

01:40:07.393 --> 01:40:08.942
burn in your nose?

01:40:08.942 --> 01:40:10.444
MATT: (laughs) Oh my god.

01:40:10.444 --> 01:40:11.782
LIAM: Get ready.

01:40:11.782 --> 01:40:14.592
Very first minute, door is up, painting begins.

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:15.485
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

01:40:16.602 --> 01:40:17.435
LIAM: Okay.

01:40:19.322 --> 01:40:20.155
TRAVIS: All right.
ASHLEY: This is a trap.

01:40:20.155 --> 01:40:21.735
TRAVIS: I'm going to kick it off.

01:40:21.735 --> 01:40:22.568
SAM: You got this.

01:40:22.568 --> 01:40:24.645
TRAVIS: Three.
LAURA: Remind us that we have the thing--

01:40:24.645 --> 01:40:26.399
TRAVIS: Two.
LAURA: they can cast every once in a while.

01:40:26.399 --> 01:40:27.782
TALIESIN: You have the thing. Yeah, I will do it.

01:40:27.782 --> 01:40:29.092
MARISHA: Don't forget to check in.

01:40:30.242 --> 01:40:31.662
SAM: I always remember.

01:40:31.662 --> 01:40:33.922
TRAVIS: I'll focus really, really intently.

01:40:33.922 --> 01:40:37.268
And I will cast my first 6th-level spell.

01:40:37.268 --> 01:40:38.101
SAM: Ooh!

01:40:38.101 --> 01:40:39.209
TRAVIS: Arcane Gate.

01:40:39.209 --> 01:40:40.500
(whooshing)

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:43.002
And 10 feet to my right, in the tree cover

01:40:44.172 --> 01:40:47.992
facing-- the opening facing towards the structure.

01:40:47.992 --> 01:40:49.812
So if you were facing the other way, you wouldn't see it.

01:40:49.812 --> 01:40:53.952
you see an archway sort of appear in the air,

01:40:53.952 --> 01:40:58.202
filled with fog, almost covering

01:40:58.202 --> 01:41:00.235
the surface of the portal.

01:41:00.235 --> 01:41:02.772
It's a few inches off of the ground.

01:41:02.772 --> 01:41:05.432
It sort of floats and it's opaque.

01:41:05.432 --> 01:41:06.972
You can't see through it.

01:41:06.972 --> 01:41:10.312
And I will put the other gate

01:41:10.312 --> 01:41:13.265
exactly where Caleb and Jester pointed out.

01:41:14.632 --> 01:41:15.512
MATT: Right there?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:41:15.512 --> 01:41:17.324
LIAM: Yes!
TRAVIS: Five feet from the wall.

01:41:17.324 --> 01:41:18.157
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:41:18.157 --> 01:41:21.672
TRAVIS: And I will face it directly towards it.

01:41:21.672 --> 01:41:22.882
MATT: All right.

01:41:22.882 --> 01:41:25.402
You watch as the fog that holds that space

01:41:25.402 --> 01:41:27.022
suddenly dissipates,

01:41:27.022 --> 01:41:29.732
like somebody had thrown a droplet into still water

01:41:29.732 --> 01:41:31.582
and as it scatters outward,

01:41:31.582 --> 01:41:34.652
you see, very close, the stone wall in shadow

01:41:34.652 --> 01:41:35.812
on that side of the building.

01:41:35.812 --> 01:41:37.621
ASHLEY: That is so cool.

01:41:37.621 --> 01:41:39.162
LAURA: This is so cool, Fjord.

01:41:39.162 --> 01:41:40.162
TRAVIS: It's pretty neat.

01:41:40.162 --> 01:41:40.995
SAM: Paint!

01:41:40.995 --> 01:41:42.650
LAURA: Can they hear us through the doorway, too?

01:41:42.650 --> 01:41:44.933
TRAVIS: I don't think so. I don't think so.

01:41:44.933 --> 01:41:46.142
Thank the Wild Mother.

01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:48.802
SAM: Paint, young woman. Paint like the wind!

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:50.612
LIAM: While Jester is painting, I'm going to put up

01:41:50.612 --> 01:41:53.279
Detect Magic now and start 10 minutes of that going.

01:41:53.279 --> 01:41:54.112
MATT: Okay.

01:41:54.112 --> 01:41:55.242
LAURA: And I'm hoping Pass Without a Trace

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:57.551
is still up for another like 10 minutes or so.

01:41:57.551 --> 01:41:58.384
MATT: Okay.

01:41:59.382 --> 01:42:02.162
You can roll either a dexterity or a performance check

01:42:02.162 --> 01:42:05.705
to see the quality of your paint.

01:42:08.042 --> 01:42:10.692
LAURA: I hate having to roll for this.

01:42:10.692 --> 01:42:11.702
SAM: (laughs)

01:42:11.702 --> 01:42:12.535
TRAVIS: Oh, the circle is--

01:42:12.535 --> 01:42:14.634
SAM: I hate the rules of the game

01:42:14.634 --> 01:42:16.422
that I've played for six years.

01:42:16.422 --> 01:42:18.113
TRAVIS: The circle is two feet in diameter--

01:42:18.113 --> 01:42:19.522
LIAM: What's that, Mr. Natural One?
TRAVIS: if it ever comes up,

01:42:19.522 --> 01:42:21.322
two people could go through it, if you need to,

01:42:21.322 --> 01:42:22.375
at the same time.
MATT: Yes.

01:42:23.855 --> 01:42:24.972
LAURA: 21.

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:26.595
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: 21 is very good.

01:42:27.762 --> 01:42:29.262
That'll enable you to finish it

01:42:29.262 --> 01:42:31.122
within this last 10 minute period of time

01:42:31.122 --> 01:42:33.942
before your spell completes.

01:42:33.942 --> 01:42:38.862
About six or seven minutes into you painting,

01:42:38.862 --> 01:42:40.522
Caduceus, keeping watch off to the side,

01:42:40.522 --> 01:42:44.422
you do see one guard is starting to come

01:42:44.422 --> 01:42:49.012
from the southern side and approach towards the north edge,

01:42:49.012 --> 01:42:51.461
closer to the perimeter.

01:42:51.461 --> 01:42:53.278
SAM: Inside the--

01:42:53.278 --> 01:42:56.016
MATT: Inside the gate, but close to the Gate.

01:42:56.016 --> 01:43:00.023
And would likely intersect between the structure and the--

01:43:00.023 --> 01:43:01.772
TALIESIN: Oh, oh, oh.
MATT: -- wrought iron.

01:43:01.772 --> 01:43:04.572
TRAVIS: He points it out and I'll rotate the door

01:43:04.572 --> 01:43:06.595
so it puts it back towards where that guard could be.

01:43:06.595 --> 01:43:10.042
LAURA: I quickly start painting grass a little bit higher

01:43:10.042 --> 01:43:12.502
to hide a little bit of the door.

01:43:12.502 --> 01:43:13.585
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:43:14.457 --> 01:43:15.887
SAM: Do we want to distract that guard?

01:43:15.887 --> 01:43:18.502
TALIESIN: I think we just back off and let him walk by.

01:43:18.502 --> 01:43:19.962
LAURA: Okay.

01:43:19.962 --> 01:43:24.052
MATT: Okay, so you are now currently drawing.

01:43:24.052 --> 01:43:24.885
LAURA: Uh-huh.

01:43:26.397 --> 01:43:27.230
How far away is--

01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:30.662
MATT: The rest of you notice this. While she's doing this,

01:43:30.662 --> 01:43:33.472
she is leaning through the portal

01:43:33.472 --> 01:43:35.541
and painting on the wall.

01:43:35.541 --> 01:43:39.092
On the other side, where the structure is,

01:43:39.092 --> 01:43:42.242
you see an arm and a shoulder

01:43:42.242 --> 01:43:45.442
that's just floating in the middle of the air.

01:43:45.442 --> 01:43:46.412
MARISHA: That's cool.
SAM: Pull her.

01:43:46.412 --> 01:43:48.322
Pull her out, pull her out. The guard's coming.

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:50.011
MATT: The portal itself is invisible,

01:43:50.011 --> 01:43:52.865
but anything that passes through is still visible.

01:43:52.865 --> 01:43:54.992
You just see this faint fog image

01:43:54.992 --> 01:43:56.112
where the cross section is,

01:43:56.112 --> 01:43:57.612
and you see this shoulder and hand

01:43:57.612 --> 01:43:59.302
that is in the process of painting out

01:43:59.302 --> 01:44:01.492
a heavier portion of the door, doing the texture on it,

01:44:01.492 --> 01:44:03.022
the gap between where the hinges are,

01:44:03.022 --> 01:44:04.782
up at the top of the pull part.

01:44:04.782 --> 01:44:06.182
It's looking really good,

01:44:06.182 --> 01:44:10.352
and while she's concentrating, you're not certain

01:44:10.352 --> 01:44:12.539
if she's going to finish before this guard arrives.

01:44:12.539 --> 01:44:14.774
SAM: Just get-- pull her out, pull her!

01:44:14.774 --> 01:44:16.160
TRAVIS: I reach up, I grab the back of her cloak

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:17.221
and I pull her back through the door.

01:44:17.221 --> 01:44:18.948
MATT: (whooshing)

01:44:18.948 --> 01:44:19.781
TRAVIS: Hi!
MATT: You get pulled back on it.

01:44:19.781 --> 01:44:21.499
LAURA: What happened?

01:44:21.499 --> 01:44:22.599
TRAVIS: And I turn the door.

01:44:23.492 --> 01:44:25.517
MATT: Everyone go ahead and make a stealth check, please.

01:44:25.517 --> 01:44:27.591
MARISHA: We still have Pass Without a Trace?

01:44:27.591 --> 01:44:29.232
MATT: You would still have Pass Without a Trace.

01:44:29.232 --> 01:44:30.665
MARISHA: Great.

01:44:30.665 --> 01:44:32.192
TRAVIS: 29.

01:44:32.192 --> 01:44:34.092
LIAM: (laughs)

01:44:34.092 --> 01:44:34.925
TRAVIS: Crazy for me.

01:44:34.925 --> 01:44:36.102
LAURA: 19.

01:44:36.102 --> 01:44:36.935
LIAM: 15.

01:44:36.935 --> 01:44:38.710
SAM: 36.

01:44:38.710 --> 01:44:39.662
LIAM: I rolled a three.

01:44:39.662 --> 01:44:41.367
MATT: You said that with such disdain.

01:44:41.367 --> 01:44:42.762
(laughter)

01:44:42.762 --> 01:44:44.967
TRAVIS: So pedestrian.
MATT: Friendship over.

01:44:44.967 --> 01:44:45.800
LIAM: This sickens me.

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.402
TALIESIN: Plus 10.

01:44:47.402 --> 01:44:48.902
ASHLEY: 31.
SAM: Oh yeah.

01:44:48.902 --> 01:44:50.068
MATT: Ooh.
TALIESIN: 16.

01:44:50.068 --> 01:44:51.261
ASHLEY: That's pretty funky.

01:44:51.261 --> 01:44:52.139
MARISHA: 38.

01:44:52.139 --> 01:44:52.972
MATT: Okay.

01:44:52.972 --> 01:44:53.805
LIAM: Go ahead with your bad self.

01:44:53.805 --> 01:44:55.092
MATT: You all hold your breath,

01:44:55.092 --> 01:44:57.302
at this perimeter, you can just hear

01:44:57.302 --> 01:44:59.702
the ever so faint sound of the Gate

01:44:59.702 --> 01:45:03.484
just like (wind blowing).

01:45:03.484 --> 01:45:06.905
It sounds like the faintest breeze at the proximity to you.

01:45:08.822 --> 01:45:10.142
The guard passes by,

01:45:10.142 --> 01:45:14.345
glances out into the woods, takes a bite of some--

01:45:14.345 --> 01:45:15.952
it looks like jerky or bark,

01:45:15.952 --> 01:45:18.082
some sort of a snack that he had in a pouch.

01:45:18.082 --> 01:45:21.632
Not very appetizing, like a dark brown, mealy texture.

01:45:21.632 --> 01:45:24.995
Chews a bit, just continues walking.

01:45:26.572 --> 01:45:28.072
TRAVIS: Back the way he came?

01:45:28.072 --> 01:45:30.902
MATT: No, just continuing on now to the western side,

01:45:30.902 --> 01:45:33.987
or the eastern side, so he's now passing this way.

01:45:35.262 --> 01:45:36.642
You get to a point where you feel comfortable

01:45:36.642 --> 01:45:39.442
that you'd be out of sight of him.

01:45:39.442 --> 01:45:41.752
You jump in and you finish up the artwork.

01:45:41.752 --> 01:45:45.712
As you're finishing up the art piece, you're getting close

01:45:45.712 --> 01:45:47.582
to the 10 minute mark, which is how long

01:45:47.582 --> 01:45:49.002
that Gate--
TRAVIS: Stays up.

01:45:49.002 --> 01:45:49.842
MATT: -- stays up.

01:45:49.842 --> 01:45:51.412
So as soon as you complete it,

01:45:51.412 --> 01:45:53.242
you finish the flourishes.

01:45:53.242 --> 01:45:56.842
You watch for a second as the 2D image

01:45:56.842 --> 01:45:59.339
that you've done, well-shaded as it is,

01:45:59.339 --> 01:46:00.172
(sucking sound) sets in.

01:46:00.172 --> 01:46:02.392
It's like watching something 2D get pushed into 3D

01:46:02.392 --> 01:46:04.312
and suddenly it's there.

01:46:04.312 --> 01:46:05.828
It's apparated.
SAM: Did you sign it?

01:46:05.828 --> 01:46:07.124
An artwork isn't done unless you sign it.

01:46:07.124 --> 01:46:09.165
LAURA: Shh, we got to go.

01:46:09.165 --> 01:46:10.612
TRAVIS: Team Fire Storm, go.

01:46:10.612 --> 01:46:12.532
MARISHA: Go.
SAM: Team Fire Storm. I'll go first.

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:13.673
LAURA: I'm going to recast Pass Without a Trace

01:46:13.673 --> 01:46:14.731
on three of us.

01:46:14.731 --> 01:46:17.092
MARISHA: I'm huddling close to you for this jog in.

01:46:17.092 --> 01:46:18.472
LAURA: It'll probably go away as soon as

01:46:18.472 --> 01:46:19.399
you're 30 feet away from me.

01:46:19.399 --> 01:46:22.092
MARISHA: That's okay, even just for the sprint across.

01:46:22.092 --> 01:46:23.641
SAM: Okay, I'll jump in first.

01:46:23.641 --> 01:46:24.474
MATT: Okay.

01:46:24.474 --> 01:46:25.307
SAM: Crossbow drawn.

01:46:26.742 --> 01:46:27.575
MATT: All right.

01:46:27.575 --> 01:46:31.032
So you pull the trap door open,

01:46:31.032 --> 01:46:33.702
and it is darkly lit inside,

01:46:33.702 --> 01:46:35.495
very minimal light.

01:46:36.442 --> 01:46:38.912
As you step in and leap into the space,

01:46:38.912 --> 01:46:40.962
the first one in, make a perception check.

01:46:40.962 --> 01:46:41.945
SAM: I'm not good at that.

01:46:41.945 --> 01:46:42.862
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:46:42.862 --> 01:46:43.982
SAM: Perception? 10.

01:46:43.982 --> 01:46:45.761
LAURA: Oh, come on.

01:46:45.761 --> 01:46:49.349
MATT: 10, looks pretty safe.

01:46:49.349 --> 01:46:51.452
(laughter)

01:46:51.452 --> 01:46:53.053
MARISHA: Holy shit.
LAURA: You stand right there?

01:46:53.053 --> 01:46:54.891
TRAVIS: (rapid impacts)
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:46:54.891 --> 01:46:56.687
LAURA: Are you standing on the inside, or you just open up?

01:46:56.687 --> 01:46:59.322
SAM: I'm inside the building, yeah.

01:46:59.322 --> 01:47:00.622
Yeah, I'm inside the building.

01:47:00.622 --> 01:47:01.455
LAURA: Okay.

01:47:01.455 --> 01:47:02.782
LIAM: I Message her.
LAURA: I guess I'll come in.

01:47:02.782 --> 01:47:04.090
LIAM: Clear?

01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:05.412
SAM: Clear.

01:47:05.412 --> 01:47:06.362
LAURA: I'll go in last.

01:47:06.362 --> 01:47:07.503
You go.

01:47:07.503 --> 01:47:09.152
LIAM: All right. I start crawling in.

01:47:09.152 --> 01:47:11.932
MATT: Okay, so you go into the space there.

01:47:11.932 --> 01:47:12.848
LAURA: Do you see anything?

01:47:12.848 --> 01:47:13.681
LIAM: Look, look, look, look, yes.

01:47:13.681 --> 01:47:14.872
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:47:14.872 --> 01:47:16.488
SAM: It's 15 people.
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:47:16.488 --> 01:47:17.321
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:47:17.321 --> 01:47:18.632
MATT: Natural 20, nice.

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:22.043
SAM: 15 dudes right there.

01:47:22.043 --> 01:47:24.145
TRAVIS: "You see this door being drawn the last 10 minutes?"

01:47:24.145 --> 01:47:26.190
(laughter)

01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:27.282
MATT: To the immediate right of you,

01:47:27.282 --> 01:47:30.202
you see the doorway that leads towards

01:47:30.202 --> 01:47:33.382
the central chamber of the structure,

01:47:33.382 --> 01:47:34.612
the secondary door beyond that

01:47:34.612 --> 01:47:36.192
that leads towards the basement

01:47:36.192 --> 01:47:37.902
that is where your quarry is,

01:47:37.902 --> 01:47:40.002
and the rest of this length of hallway in the back,

01:47:40.002 --> 01:47:42.402
you can see there's a handful of tables and chairs.

01:47:42.402 --> 01:47:47.027
It looks like a simple roll desk of some kind,

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.401
but the room is empty.

01:47:49.401 --> 01:47:51.892
LIAM: I have Detect Magic up. Is anything going off?

01:47:51.892 --> 01:47:52.992
MATT: Currently no.
LIAM: No.

01:47:54.016 --> 01:47:55.191
(whispers) Come on.

01:47:56.102 --> 01:47:59.202
MARISHA: Right as she goes in, I scale the wall,

01:47:59.202 --> 01:48:01.732
and try and get the most out of my 30 feet of

01:48:01.732 --> 01:48:02.757
Pass Without a Trace.

01:48:02.757 --> 01:48:05.125
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check for me.

01:48:08.222 --> 01:48:09.055
LIAM: Get it, Naruto.

01:48:09.055 --> 01:48:11.402
MARISHA: That's really bad, I rolled a two.

01:48:11.402 --> 01:48:12.896
12.

01:48:12.896 --> 01:48:14.202
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: 12?

01:48:14.202 --> 01:48:15.061
SAM: It's already failed.

01:48:15.061 --> 01:48:16.277
MARISHA: A two.
MARISHA: It's tough.

01:48:16.277 --> 01:48:18.422
MARISHA: Unarmored move, I can climb walls.

01:48:18.422 --> 01:48:19.932
MATT: You can climb walls.
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:48:19.932 --> 01:48:20.962
MATT: That's part of the monk thing.

01:48:20.962 --> 01:48:22.502
MARISHA: Part of a monk, yeah, wall climb.

01:48:22.502 --> 01:48:27.240
ASHLEY: Don't you add 10 and what's your thing?

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.018
MARISHA: I can just climb walls, I'm just a monk.

01:48:31.018 --> 01:48:33.050
SAM: I'm just a simple monk.

01:48:33.050 --> 01:48:35.658
LIAM: Immediately starts grunting like a freeclimber.

01:48:35.658 --> 01:48:36.691
Uh!

01:48:36.691 --> 01:48:37.999
Uh!

01:48:37.999 --> 01:48:38.832
Uh!

01:48:38.832 --> 01:48:40.423
TRAVIS: It's the just got laid modifier.

01:48:40.423 --> 01:48:41.412
(laughter)

01:48:41.412 --> 01:48:42.245
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Plus what?

01:48:42.245 --> 01:48:44.089
LIAM: That's an advantage.
MARISHA: Add a d12.

01:48:44.089 --> 01:48:45.730
MATT: What is that ability again? That is the--

01:48:45.730 --> 01:48:49.172
MARISHA: Unarmored movement, the water and walls.

01:48:49.172 --> 01:48:51.522
I can walk across water and I can run up walls.

01:48:53.142 --> 01:48:54.902
MATT: Yeah, to move along vertical surfaces, you know what?

01:48:54.902 --> 01:48:56.646
Then, yeah, you don't even need to make that check.

01:48:56.646 --> 01:48:59.102
MARISHA: Oh, thank god.
MATT: But do make a stealth check for me, please.

01:48:59.102 --> 01:49:00.158
MARISHA: Do I still get Pass Without a Trace?

01:49:00.158 --> 01:49:03.682
MATT: You would because you are right behind

01:49:03.682 --> 01:49:04.515
where she is entering, yes.

01:49:04.515 --> 01:49:06.415
MARISHA: Great, 30 total.
SAM: Oh my god.

01:49:08.282 --> 01:49:10.322
MATT: With no sound, the rest of you watch

01:49:10.322 --> 01:49:13.342
as Beauregard just vertically (quiet footsteps)

01:49:13.342 --> 01:49:14.651
up to the top.
TRAVIS: Makes sense.

01:49:14.651 --> 01:49:18.165
MARISHA: And I'm just going to tumble roll and flatten

01:49:18.165 --> 01:49:19.775
onto the roof.

01:49:19.775 --> 01:49:21.181
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: 15 guards.

01:49:21.181 --> 01:49:22.362
SAM: They're all sunbathing.

01:49:22.362 --> 01:49:26.129
MATT: No, no, not 15, but there is one.

01:49:26.129 --> 01:49:27.312
(gasping)
MARISHA: There is one?

01:49:27.312 --> 01:49:30.232
MATT: You roll over and look just to your left,

01:49:30.232 --> 01:49:33.190
and you see a guard that is currently

01:49:33.190 --> 01:49:34.362
perched on the edge,

01:49:34.362 --> 01:49:36.662
looking over, down into the courtyard

01:49:36.662 --> 01:49:38.722
with a heavy crossbow in his lap.

01:49:38.722 --> 01:49:41.202
He's not sitting in a chair,

01:49:41.202 --> 01:49:42.552
just sitting on the ground.

01:49:42.552 --> 01:49:44.092
MARISHA: He does not know I'm here yet.

01:49:44.092 --> 01:49:46.398
MATT: He does not, at the moment, seem to notice you.

01:49:46.398 --> 01:49:48.065
SAM: Get that garrotte.

01:49:50.353 --> 01:49:51.942
LIAM: Have fun.

01:49:51.942 --> 01:49:53.649
TALIESIN: Are we going to eat through this guy?

01:49:55.548 --> 01:49:57.632
Sorry, not helping.

01:49:57.632 --> 01:49:59.322
TRAVIS: Say nothing, say nothing.

01:49:59.322 --> 01:50:01.142
MARISHA: I kind of want to say nothing.

01:50:01.142 --> 01:50:04.296
Do I see things to hide behind?

01:50:04.296 --> 01:50:05.221
MATT: No.

01:50:05.221 --> 01:50:09.232
You are literally in this parapet of just an open floor,

01:50:09.232 --> 01:50:12.262
a trap door that is to the right of him

01:50:12.262 --> 01:50:14.302
that leads further down into the tower,

01:50:14.302 --> 01:50:16.838
and it's just him, just perched there.

01:50:16.838 --> 01:50:18.398
LIAM: She's 10 seconds away from that--

01:50:18.398 --> 01:50:20.524
MATT: He's about a foot from you,
a foot and a half from you.

01:50:20.524 --> 01:50:21.595
LAURA: Just bail, just bail.

01:50:22.992 --> 01:50:23.825
TRAVIS: Hi.
SAM: Kill him!

01:50:23.825 --> 01:50:26.752
MARISHA: Okay, okay, I do not want to kill him.

01:50:26.752 --> 01:50:28.772
This is really bad.
SAM: Slash his throat.

01:50:28.772 --> 01:50:31.002
MARISHA: Oh my god.
I'm not an assassin rogue.

01:50:31.002 --> 01:50:32.915
If I was an assassin rogue, I would.

01:50:36.182 --> 01:50:37.072
Holy fuck.

01:50:37.072 --> 01:50:37.905
LAURA: Just bail.

01:50:37.905 --> 01:50:38.738
MARISHA: Holy fuck.

01:50:39.832 --> 01:50:42.382
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:42.382 --> 01:50:43.415
TRAVIS: You didn't plan for this?

01:50:43.415 --> 01:50:45.462
MARISHA: Uh, no.

01:50:45.462 --> 01:50:46.369
TALIESIN: Do we ever?

01:50:46.369 --> 01:50:48.862
MATT: In the time that you are lying on your back,

01:50:48.862 --> 01:50:50.779
holding perfectly still

01:50:51.632 --> 01:50:55.932
just staring at the man, boring a hole into the back

01:50:55.932 --> 01:50:56.942
of this guy's head.

01:50:56.942 --> 01:50:58.608
ASHLEY: What do I do?

01:50:58.608 --> 01:51:00.966
What do I do?
MATT: Just clutching the stone quietly,

01:51:00.966 --> 01:51:03.002
with your passive perception,

01:51:03.002 --> 01:51:05.065
you do hear a very faint sound.

01:51:06.632 --> 01:51:08.298
MARISHA: What?
MATT: (snoring)

01:51:08.298 --> 01:51:09.705
MARISHA: He's asleep?

01:51:10.931 --> 01:51:13.412
MATT: (snoring)

01:51:13.412 --> 01:51:14.760
He is napping at his post.

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:17.135
LIAM: You son of a bitch.
ASHLEY: Good boy.

01:51:20.082 --> 01:51:20.915
TRAVIS: End him.

01:51:20.915 --> 01:51:22.442
MARISHA: You know what I want to do, right?

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:23.471
You know what I want to do?

01:51:23.471 --> 01:51:24.829
ASHLEY: Oh, Beau!

01:51:25.732 --> 01:51:26.972
TRAVIS: I'm not here.

01:51:26.972 --> 01:51:27.805
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, this is--

01:51:27.805 --> 01:51:28.693
MATT: The Gate closes.

01:51:28.693 --> 01:51:30.382
(air whooshing)

01:51:30.382 --> 01:51:31.628
TRAVIS: I close it.

01:51:31.628 --> 01:51:34.947
(laughter)

01:51:34.947 --> 01:51:35.780
It's under control.

01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:37.572
MATT: The flourish is a little delayed, but--

01:51:37.572 --> 01:51:39.012
(laughter)

01:51:39.012 --> 01:51:40.582
TALIESIN: How's that [inaudible] working out for you.

01:51:40.582 --> 01:51:41.572
SAM: You can't break up with me,

01:51:41.572 --> 01:51:43.239
I break up with you!
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs)

01:51:44.816 --> 01:51:46.404
I'm not fired, I quit!

01:51:46.404 --> 01:51:49.929
(laughter)

01:51:50.769 --> 01:51:51.602
MATT: Beauregard, what are you doing?

01:51:51.602 --> 01:51:53.685
(laughter)

01:51:55.082 --> 01:51:56.682
MARISHA: Okay.

01:51:56.682 --> 01:51:58.002
Oh my god, what am I doing?

01:51:58.002 --> 01:51:59.172
Oh my god.

01:51:59.172 --> 01:52:01.952
Do I just chill here with this guy?

01:52:01.952 --> 01:52:04.905
TRAVIS: I love one sleeping dude has you rocked.

01:52:07.192 --> 01:52:09.322
MARISHA: Because do I kill him?

01:52:09.322 --> 01:52:10.242
MATT: Beauregard, what do you do?

01:52:10.242 --> 01:52:12.223
LIAM: I'd like it if she just chilled out like this.

01:52:12.223 --> 01:52:14.182
(laughter)

01:52:14.182 --> 01:52:15.015
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:52:15.015 --> 01:52:17.192
LIAM: And then at the (quick hit).

01:52:17.192 --> 01:52:18.025
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:52:19.372 --> 01:52:20.205
MATT: Just snoring at his post.

01:52:20.205 --> 01:52:21.038
TRAVIS: Do you have rope?

01:52:21.038 --> 01:52:22.992
MATT: Well, here, while you're contemplating what you do,

01:52:22.992 --> 01:52:27.986
as you stand there perfectly still, thinking real hard,

01:52:27.986 --> 01:52:31.112
looking up into the semi-cloudy sky above,

01:52:31.112 --> 01:52:33.552
the rest of you in this chamber,

01:52:33.552 --> 01:52:36.772
quiet, with very, very little light

01:52:36.772 --> 01:52:39.272
that seems to be coming in from the partially open

01:52:39.272 --> 01:52:40.682
like ever so faintly open door

01:52:40.682 --> 01:52:43.082
that leads into the next chamber,

01:52:43.082 --> 01:52:45.442
your eyes adjusting to the darkness,

01:52:45.442 --> 01:52:46.966
you see what's ahead of you, what do you do?

01:52:46.966 --> 01:52:48.880
LIAM: Veth, is this door okay?

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:49.729
SAM: Which one? The middle one?

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:50.571
LIAM: The second one.

01:52:50.571 --> 01:52:52.270
SAM: The second one? I'll check it.

01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:53.411
Check for traps!

01:52:53.411 --> 01:52:54.525
MATT: Investigation check.

01:52:56.402 --> 01:52:57.235
SAM: 23.

01:52:58.536 --> 01:53:00.222
MATT: And you do not have darkvision, right?

01:53:00.222 --> 01:53:02.230
SAM: I do. Oh, wait.

01:53:02.230 --> 01:53:03.592
MATT: Nope, that's the goblin form.

01:53:03.592 --> 01:53:05.330
SAM: I don't. Disadvantage?

01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:06.355
MATT: With disadvantage on this.

01:53:06.355 --> 01:53:08.032
SAM: Still 23.

01:53:08.032 --> 01:53:08.982
I mean, it's always 23.

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:11.052
MATT: Oh this, yeah, because fucking rogues.

01:53:11.052 --> 01:53:11.885
Okay.

01:53:11.885 --> 01:53:13.766
(laughter)

01:53:16.315 --> 01:53:20.262
The door is locked, does not appear to be trapped,

01:53:20.262 --> 01:53:21.952
but it is locked.

01:53:21.952 --> 01:53:23.702
SAM: It's locked, I'll need to pick it.

01:53:23.702 --> 01:53:24.942
Okay.

01:53:24.942 --> 01:53:26.442
I told Beauregard I would check in.

01:53:26.442 --> 01:53:28.382
Someone say sarsaparilla to her.

01:53:28.382 --> 01:53:29.962
Unless you can't.

01:53:29.962 --> 01:53:31.212
LIAM: Sarsaparilla's good.

01:53:32.382 --> 01:53:33.315
Sarsaparilla.

01:53:34.215 --> 01:53:35.392
MATT: In the middle of your tense moment,

01:53:35.392 --> 01:53:37.482
you hear, "Sarsaparilla,"

01:53:37.482 --> 01:53:39.315
in your ear real fast.

01:53:40.770 --> 01:53:42.232
MARISHA: Sarsaparilla.

01:53:42.232 --> 01:53:44.852
LIAM: Okay, she's good, we're good, proceed.

01:53:44.852 --> 01:53:46.645
SAM: Okay, I'm going to pick the lock.

01:53:48.887 --> 01:53:50.082
LAURA: Oh, Guidance.

01:53:50.082 --> 01:53:51.022
SAM: Too late.

01:53:52.997 --> 01:53:54.802
MATT: Dex and proficiency bonus.

01:53:55.652 --> 01:53:57.702
SAM: Sleight, sorry, thieves' tools?

01:53:57.702 --> 01:53:59.243
Thieves' tools.
MATT: Thieves tools, yeah, so it's--

01:53:59.243 --> 01:54:01.612
SAM: Disadvantage? No.

01:54:01.612 --> 01:54:03.799
MATT: Because of your lack of sight here,

01:54:03.799 --> 01:54:05.522
I'd say no, because it's not so much sight

01:54:05.522 --> 01:54:07.002
more than it is feeling it, so you're fine.

01:54:07.002 --> 01:54:08.409
SAM: 31.

01:54:08.409 --> 01:54:10.394
MATT: 31.

01:54:10.394 --> 01:54:12.452
(lock clicking) (door creaking)

01:54:12.452 --> 01:54:15.262
Ever so faintly creaks as it begins to push open,

01:54:15.262 --> 01:54:16.856
but it does open.

01:54:16.856 --> 01:54:18.595
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to pull out,

01:54:20.842 --> 01:54:23.842
wait, let me see if I still have it.

01:54:23.842 --> 01:54:25.472
TALIESIN: I mean your stealth's still up, so.

01:54:25.472 --> 01:54:27.127
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:54:27.127 --> 01:54:27.960
MATT: They're stealthed.

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:30.760
LAURA: I'm just seeing because I
have that hair oil that I bought.

01:54:31.802 --> 01:54:32.635
So I'm going to use--

01:54:32.635 --> 01:54:34.332
SAM: I already opened the door.
LIAM: While she's checking her pack,

01:54:34.332 --> 01:54:35.862
I'm going to lean over Veth's head

01:54:35.862 --> 01:54:38.702
and peek through, and see if there's any threat

01:54:38.702 --> 01:54:40.022
in the next--

01:54:40.022 --> 01:54:42.162
MATT: Well, the door, you unlocked it

01:54:42.162 --> 01:54:43.850
and it just barely went.

01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:45.812
It is very creaky.

01:54:45.812 --> 01:54:48.692
LAURA: I'm going to put my hair oil on the hinges.

01:54:48.692 --> 01:54:49.832
TRAVIS: The stank stuff?
MATT: Okay.

01:54:49.832 --> 01:54:50.882
LAURA: Yeah, my nasty hair oil that I have.

01:54:50.882 --> 01:54:51.822
MATT: Okay, yeah, you do.

01:54:51.822 --> 01:54:53.132
All right, so you go ahead and take a moment

01:54:53.132 --> 01:54:55.042
to apply the hair oil to the hinges.

01:54:55.042 --> 01:54:56.422
TALIESIN: Weird, I'm into it.

01:54:56.422 --> 01:54:58.962
MATT: It creaks ever so faintly
as you move it back and forth

01:54:58.962 --> 01:55:00.922
a bit, just to get it to follow the hinges,

01:55:00.922 --> 01:55:05.471
and then opens with very, very,

01:55:05.471 --> 01:55:06.719
<i>very</i> minor sound.

01:55:06.719 --> 01:55:08.385
SAM: Nice.
ASHLEY: Nice, nice, nice.

01:55:08.385 --> 01:55:10.032
SAM: Okay, now look.

01:55:10.032 --> 01:55:11.122
LIAM: Right, so I probably have like

01:55:11.122 --> 01:55:14.442
five or six minutes left of Detect Magic.

01:55:14.442 --> 01:55:16.472
MATT: These stairs-- As you step into this chamber

01:55:16.472 --> 01:55:19.557
and look inside, this chamber is mainly empty.

01:55:19.557 --> 01:55:21.092
You can see a couple of

01:55:21.092 --> 01:55:25.442
discarded bags of burlap.

01:55:25.442 --> 01:55:27.292
Like maybe some things are just been thrown in here

01:55:27.292 --> 01:55:29.562
for the time being, nowhere else to put it.

01:55:29.562 --> 01:55:31.962
But there is a staircase that descends below

01:55:31.962 --> 01:55:35.622
and does match the layout that you were given.

01:55:35.622 --> 01:55:37.392
LIAM: Okay, <i>eins, zwei, drei.</i>

01:55:37.392 --> 01:55:39.298
Ready? Let's go.

01:55:39.298 --> 01:55:40.702
SAM: Wait, who's? Am I <i>ein</i>?

01:55:40.702 --> 01:55:42.199
LIAM: One, two, three.

01:55:42.199 --> 01:55:43.369
LAURA: You're going last?

01:55:45.222 --> 01:55:47.675
You should go in the middle, because you're weakest.

01:55:49.836 --> 01:55:51.302
(laughter)

01:55:51.302 --> 01:55:52.902
SAM: Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:55:52.902 --> 01:55:54.212
I'll do another Message spell,

01:55:54.212 --> 01:55:56.167
this time to Caduceus, just saying:

01:55:56.167 --> 01:55:58.602
Team Fire Storm, sarsaparilla.

01:55:58.602 --> 01:56:00.676
You can reply to this message.

01:56:00.676 --> 01:56:02.796
TALIESIN: Sarsaparilla, all good.

01:56:02.796 --> 01:56:04.252
(laughter)

01:56:04.252 --> 01:56:06.058
SAM: Okay.

01:56:06.058 --> 01:56:07.183
With me, ready?

01:56:08.232 --> 01:56:09.112
LIAM: What is it?

01:56:09.112 --> 01:56:11.778
TRAVIS: Oh no.
LIAM: Wasn't it like this?

01:56:11.778 --> 01:56:14.020
TRAVIS: Wow. The mongoose strikes again.

01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:15.912
(laughter)

01:56:15.912 --> 01:56:17.112
SAM: All right, so as you--

01:56:17.112 --> 01:56:17.945
ASHLEY: Yeah, what was that?

01:56:17.945 --> 01:56:19.142
MATT: -- descend the stairs, I'd like everyone to roll

01:56:19.142 --> 01:56:21.172
a stealth check who is part of this troupe.

01:56:21.172 --> 01:56:23.228
LAURA: Plus 10.

01:56:23.228 --> 01:56:25.770
TRAVIS: Fire Storm, hu-hep!

01:56:27.302 --> 01:56:28.742
SAM: 44.

01:56:28.742 --> 01:56:30.942
LIAM: There's the max! 23.

01:56:30.942 --> 01:56:32.163
LAURA: 30.

01:56:32.163 --> 01:56:33.819
MATT: All right.

01:56:33.819 --> 01:56:35.762
Quietly, you descend the stone stairs,

01:56:35.762 --> 01:56:40.302
this narrow passageway continuing downward,

01:56:40.302 --> 01:56:45.272
it opens up a little bit and the stairs begin to alight.

01:56:45.272 --> 01:56:47.752
You see a bit of a light source

01:56:47.752 --> 01:56:50.499
and an end to them within a chamber below.

01:56:50.499 --> 01:56:52.903
LAURA: Do we hear anything? Do we hear anyone? Uh-oh.

01:56:52.903 --> 01:56:54.203
MATT: Make a perception check, if you'd like.

01:56:54.203 --> 01:56:55.222
LIAM: And this is where--

01:56:55.222 --> 01:56:57.832
SAM: None of these rooms are those maps, are that map?

01:56:57.832 --> 01:56:59.162
Oh, it's a different map.

01:56:59.162 --> 01:57:00.669
Oh, oh, oh.

01:57:00.669 --> 01:57:02.427
ASHLEY: Oh no, we're getting a thing.
SAM: This map thing

01:57:02.427 --> 01:57:05.082
is brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

01:57:05.082 --> 01:57:07.442
With the reconfigured Dwarven Forge starter sets,

01:57:07.442 --> 01:57:09.462
you can get a feel for what their premium terrain

01:57:09.462 --> 01:57:10.552
is actually like.

01:57:10.552 --> 01:57:15.222
Find out more at bit.ly/critroledf.

01:57:15.222 --> 01:57:19.052
DF, because you're down to forge.

01:57:19.052 --> 01:57:19.983
TRAVIS: Dirty forge.

01:57:19.983 --> 01:57:22.872
(laughter)

01:57:22.872 --> 01:57:24.609
LAURA: Are you guys listening for anything?

01:57:24.609 --> 01:57:27.391
TRAVIS: This is where Astrid sells us out.
LAURA: I didn't hear anything.

01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:29.062
MATT: So who is listening?

01:57:29.062 --> 01:57:31.037
LIAM: Yeah, I am.
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:57:31.037 --> 01:57:32.530
SAM: Listening, listening?

01:57:32.530 --> 01:57:34.902
LAURA: Looking, perceiving.

01:57:34.902 --> 01:57:36.072
LIAM: 24.

01:57:36.072 --> 01:57:38.062
TRAVIS: Guys, we haven't had a map covered in a while.

01:57:38.062 --> 01:57:39.771
It feels real good.

01:57:39.771 --> 01:57:40.604
MARISHA: That's true.

01:57:42.062 --> 01:57:46.005
MATT: Listening in, you hear the creak of wood on wood.

01:57:46.952 --> 01:57:47.785
SAM: Above us?

01:57:47.785 --> 01:57:48.652
MATT: Below you.

01:57:48.652 --> 01:57:49.485
LAURA: Oh no.

01:57:51.142 --> 01:57:53.522
SAM: Got it.
LAURA: Get against the wall.

01:57:53.522 --> 01:57:54.572
MARISHA: My heart is pounding.

01:57:54.572 --> 01:57:55.692
LAURA: In the shadows.

01:57:55.692 --> 01:57:56.525
MATT: Okay.

01:57:57.372 --> 01:57:59.552
SAM: Like in the room or beyond?
LIAM: In the room, down below us?

01:57:59.552 --> 01:58:01.902
MATT: Below, inside the space you hear like a (creaking)

01:58:01.902 --> 01:58:02.735
LIAM: In this space.

01:58:02.735 --> 01:58:04.258
LAURA: Somebody's down there.
TRAVIS: I'll Men in Black.

01:58:04.258 --> 01:58:05.402
(pulsating)

01:58:05.402 --> 01:58:06.235
LAURA: No.

01:58:07.862 --> 01:58:09.662
TALIESIN: I love that movie.

01:58:09.662 --> 01:58:11.980
SAM: Uh.
TRAVIS: Makes me scared.

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:13.533
SAM: Smoke bomb? What do we do?

01:58:15.652 --> 01:58:18.752
I don't know where they are, I can't kill.

01:58:18.752 --> 01:58:19.918
TRAVIS: I can't, I can't kill!

01:58:19.918 --> 01:58:21.801
MATT: You're still up inside the stairwell,

01:58:21.801 --> 01:58:23.485
so you can't actually look into the room.

01:58:24.542 --> 01:58:27.102
Once you were to descend, I will reveal to you

01:58:27.102 --> 01:58:27.935
what's in there.

01:58:27.935 --> 01:58:29.602
SAM: So he also doesn't have darkvision.

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:31.268
Fuck! Why are we leading this?

01:58:31.268 --> 01:58:32.986
(laughter)

01:58:32.986 --> 01:58:34.527
MARISHA: Oh, I should have given you my fucking goggles.

01:58:34.527 --> 01:58:38.303
SAM: I'm going to reach back and
pull Jester forward to try to

01:58:38.303 --> 01:58:40.436
look into the room.
LAURA: Can I see anything?

01:58:40.436 --> 01:58:41.366
LIAM: The torches are not--
LAURA: But it's light down there,

01:58:41.366 --> 01:58:42.992
there's light down there.

01:58:42.992 --> 01:58:45.332
MATT: What you see is light. It is lit to a certain extent

01:58:45.332 --> 01:58:46.165
within the chamber.

01:58:46.165 --> 01:58:46.998
When you look down into it,

01:58:46.998 --> 01:58:48.402
you can see there's a light source.

01:58:48.402 --> 01:58:50.107
SAM: Okay, then I'll peer around the room,

01:58:50.107 --> 01:58:50.982
just see what I can see.

01:58:50.982 --> 01:58:53.992
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

01:58:53.992 --> 01:58:55.102
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:58:55.102 --> 01:58:56.289
SAM: That's a 10.

01:58:56.289 --> 01:58:57.122
MATT: That's a 10.

01:58:57.122 --> 01:58:58.952
You glance down, and you see

01:58:58.952 --> 01:59:01.512
a couple of torches set in the far corners

01:59:01.512 --> 01:59:03.772
and you see two tables of differing sizes

01:59:03.772 --> 01:59:06.452
onto the right and left, some chairs arranged around it,

01:59:06.452 --> 01:59:09.002
and you can see one individual wearing

01:59:09.002 --> 01:59:11.642
the same Vergesson guard armor

01:59:11.642 --> 01:59:13.819
is currently sitting in a chair

01:59:13.819 --> 01:59:17.715
and snacking on a small plate of food

01:59:17.715 --> 01:59:19.872
they've nearly finished.

01:59:19.872 --> 01:59:20.835
SAM: One dude.

01:59:22.128 --> 01:59:23.776
LAURA: Okay.

01:59:23.776 --> 01:59:24.776
Okay, ready?

01:59:26.602 --> 01:59:28.092
LIAM: You tell us that?

01:59:28.092 --> 01:59:31.702
SAM: I will turn around and just do this,

01:59:31.702 --> 01:59:33.165
you know, one and then.

01:59:34.202 --> 01:59:36.295
LAURA: I can I try something.

01:59:36.295 --> 01:59:37.408
SAM: What?

01:59:37.408 --> 01:59:38.366
LAURA: I can try something.

01:59:38.366 --> 01:59:39.277
SAM: Yeah, go.

01:59:39.277 --> 01:59:41.860
LIAM: Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

01:59:43.896 --> 01:59:45.216
LAURA: I don't know what that was.

01:59:45.216 --> 01:59:47.922
(laughter)

01:59:47.922 --> 01:59:50.380
MATT: He is eating to face the stairs, by the way,

01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:51.352
like his back is to the wall

01:59:51.352 --> 01:59:52.942
and he's intentionally eating

01:59:52.942 --> 01:59:54.752
while keeping an eye on the entrance,

01:59:54.752 --> 01:59:56.752
for the purposes of his post.

01:59:56.752 --> 01:59:58.652
LAURA: I'm going to--
SAM: I just want to kill him.

01:59:58.652 --> 02:00:00.682
LAURA: No, I'm going to like--
SAM: One shot.

02:00:00.682 --> 02:00:03.012
LAURA: -- just lean around the corner just a little bit,

02:00:03.012 --> 02:00:07.245
where Nott pointed, and I'm going to cast

02:00:07.245 --> 02:00:09.112
Fast Friends.

02:00:09.112 --> 02:00:09.982
MATT: Fast Friends?

02:00:09.982 --> 02:00:10.815
SAM: Oh boy.

02:00:12.072 --> 02:00:13.769
SAM: I'm still going to kill him.

02:00:13.769 --> 02:00:15.312
TRAVIS: Don't, we're going non-lethal.

02:00:15.312 --> 02:00:16.145
LIAM: Get used to it.

02:00:16.145 --> 02:00:17.272
TRAVIS: Non-lethal.

02:00:17.272 --> 02:00:18.828
SAM: Is that what we're doing? Did we decide that?

02:00:18.828 --> 02:00:20.527
TRAVIS: Well, she did.

02:00:20.527 --> 02:00:22.444
SAM: I didn't decide that.

02:00:24.792 --> 02:00:26.292
MARISHA: The shaky hands.

02:00:28.445 --> 02:00:29.812
MATT: That is a wisdom saving throw.

02:00:29.812 --> 02:00:30.645
LAURA: Yes.

02:00:34.922 --> 02:00:36.172
SAM: What's Fast Friends do?

02:00:37.672 --> 02:00:38.505
MATT: Okay.

02:00:42.147 --> 02:00:43.872
Sitting there eating.

02:00:45.182 --> 02:00:47.325
You finish casting the spell, he immediately goes,

02:00:48.262 --> 02:00:50.162
and looks right up at you.

02:00:50.162 --> 02:00:51.482
LAURA: Does he smile?

02:00:51.482 --> 02:00:56.482
MATT: Drops the food on the plate,
grabs his weapon, stands up.

02:00:59.782 --> 02:01:00.615
"Hi."

02:01:02.232 --> 02:01:03.065
LAURA: Hi.

02:01:04.122 --> 02:01:05.357
MATT: "Well, how can I help you?"

02:01:05.357 --> 02:01:07.277
(laughter)

02:01:07.277 --> 02:01:09.606
LAURA: Is there anyone else down here with you?

02:01:09.606 --> 02:01:11.905
MATT: "Yeah, we've got a few posted around.

02:01:12.783 --> 02:01:14.156
"What are you doing here?"

02:01:14.156 --> 02:01:15.327
LAURA: Oh.

02:01:16.942 --> 02:01:18.012
Anybody in this room?

02:01:18.012 --> 02:01:19.916
Nobody's in this room. Just you?

02:01:19.916 --> 02:01:21.112
MATT: "It's just me at the moment,

02:01:21.112 --> 02:01:22.212
"yeah, I was just keeping watch."

02:01:22.212 --> 02:01:26.492
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to come down and stand next to him

02:01:26.492 --> 02:01:27.522
for a minute.

02:01:27.522 --> 02:01:28.448
MATT: "What's your name?"

02:01:28.448 --> 02:01:31.079
LAURA: Oh, Fiona.

02:01:31.079 --> 02:01:32.662
MATT: "Oh."

02:01:32.662 --> 02:01:33.703
LAURA: Hold on, I'm going to see exactly

02:01:33.703 --> 02:01:35.440
what the spell does, now that I cast it.

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:37.492
(laughter)

02:01:37.492 --> 02:01:40.283
TRAVIS: Oh, good. "Now a warning?"

02:01:40.283 --> 02:01:42.430
LAURA: "Now a warning?"

02:01:42.430 --> 02:01:47.372
Okay, I can have him do something for us for an hour.

02:01:47.372 --> 02:01:49.038
TRAVIS: Like tap dance?
SAM: Oh really?

02:01:49.038 --> 02:01:49.871
LAURA: Yeah.

02:01:49.871 --> 02:01:52.070
SAM: Have him watch, make sure nobody comes up.

02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:54.637
LAURA: Yeah, okay, hey, I've got an idea for you.

02:01:54.637 --> 02:01:55.487
MATT: "Okay."

02:01:55.487 --> 02:01:57.014
MARISHA: Go relieve the other guards.

02:01:57.014 --> 02:02:01.182
LAURA: Yeah, is there anything that you know of

02:02:01.182 --> 02:02:03.782
that can help us get to a room

02:02:03.782 --> 02:02:05.782
if we need to get to it or something?

02:02:05.782 --> 02:02:06.615
MARISHA: Yes.

02:02:09.382 --> 02:02:13.834
MATT: "I'm sort of confused by the question, I guess."

02:02:13.834 --> 02:02:16.272
LAURA: I need help getting to a room.

02:02:16.272 --> 02:02:18.265
Can you help me get there?

02:02:18.265 --> 02:02:20.472
MATT: "I can walk you to it, yeah."

02:02:20.472 --> 02:02:22.412
LAURA: But I don't want any of your friends to see us.

02:02:22.412 --> 02:02:23.695
It's, like, a secret.

02:02:24.892 --> 02:02:26.152
MATT: "Wow, well, I mean,

02:02:27.124 --> 02:02:29.372
"they've all got their work to do as well."

02:02:29.372 --> 02:02:32.612
LAURA: Yeah, is there, like, a secret code

02:02:32.612 --> 02:02:34.922
that would get them dismissed for a while?

02:02:34.922 --> 02:02:36.342
Like, go to lunch or something?

02:02:36.342 --> 02:02:37.572
Relieve them?

02:02:37.572 --> 02:02:39.252
MATT: "Don't really do secret codes here."

02:02:39.252 --> 02:02:40.252
LAURA: Oh, really?

02:02:40.252 --> 02:02:41.831
MATT: "No, sorry."

02:02:41.831 --> 02:02:45.281
(awkward laughter)

02:02:48.539 --> 02:02:49.915
SAM: Worst first date ever.

02:02:51.312 --> 02:02:56.045
LAURA: Do you guys ever leave to go have dinner or anything?

02:02:56.045 --> 02:02:57.078
MATT: "I mean, yeah, eventually."

02:02:57.078 --> 02:02:57.911
LAURA: Yeah?

02:02:57.911 --> 02:03:00.192
MATT: "Yeah, when sundown goes, some of us switch off

02:03:00.192 --> 02:03:05.192
"and head into the barracks, little mess space there."

02:03:05.312 --> 02:03:06.145
LAURA: Are any of the--

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:06.978
MATT: "I can show it to you later on

02:03:06.978 --> 02:03:08.781
"if you want to see it."
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that sounds wonderful.

02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:10.864
(laughter)

02:03:12.364 --> 02:03:13.197
TRAVIS: Do his thing.

02:03:13.543 --> 02:03:14.376
MARISHA: (giggling)

02:03:14.376 --> 02:03:16.162
LAURA: Okay, tell you what,

02:03:17.409 --> 02:03:19.329
I'm just going to have my friends come down here.

02:03:19.329 --> 02:03:21.079
I have a couple of friends with me, okay?

02:03:21.079 --> 02:03:23.802
MATT: "Oh, we're not supposed
to have other people down here."

02:03:24.849 --> 02:03:26.362
LAURA: But it's okay.

02:03:27.749 --> 02:03:29.089
MATT: "For you, I'll allow it."

02:03:29.089 --> 02:03:30.287
LAURA: Okay.

02:03:30.287 --> 02:03:31.270
Come on.

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:34.519
SAM: Oh, is this the boy you were telling us about?

02:03:34.519 --> 02:03:36.249
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, he's wonderful.

02:03:36.249 --> 02:03:38.709
MATT: He seems visibly uncomfortable with your presence,

02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:43.279
but he's allowing it for her.

02:03:43.279 --> 02:03:44.389
As a note, this is concentration,

02:03:44.389 --> 02:03:45.421
and you have dropped Pass Without a Trace.

02:03:45.421 --> 02:03:46.254
LAURA: I know, I know, I know.

02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:49.319
Okay, I can just tell him to sit here

02:03:49.319 --> 02:03:51.635
and not say anything for an hour.

02:03:51.635 --> 02:03:53.389
LIAM: Or get a sandwich?

02:03:53.389 --> 02:03:56.669
LAURA: Yeah, do you want to take your--

02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:58.329
Do you need to go to the bathroom or anything?

02:03:58.329 --> 02:03:59.859
Do you need to go find a bathroom?

02:03:59.859 --> 02:04:00.959
MATT: "I guess it wouldn't hurt."

02:04:00.959 --> 02:04:02.179
SAM: If he stayed, he could tell us

02:04:02.179 --> 02:04:03.919
if anyone came down here, though.

02:04:03.919 --> 02:04:05.139
LAURA: Oh, that is true.

02:04:05.139 --> 02:04:07.839
You know what, why don't you stay here in this room?

02:04:07.839 --> 02:04:09.574
Chill like you normally do, you know,

02:04:09.574 --> 02:04:11.482
watch the stairs, that kind of thing.

02:04:13.105 --> 02:04:15.456
If anyone--

02:04:15.456 --> 02:04:18.459
If you hear shouting or something, maybe

02:04:18.459 --> 02:04:20.219
come help me or something.

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:21.849
MATT: "Of course, yeah. Yeah, I'll keep an ear out."

02:04:21.849 --> 02:04:22.682
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

02:04:22.682 --> 02:04:26.772
And if anybody comes down the stairs after us

02:04:26.772 --> 02:04:28.694
maybe just talk to them,

02:04:28.694 --> 02:04:31.429
hang out with them, distract them
a little bit. It'll be fun.

02:04:31.429 --> 02:04:32.986
MATT: "Okay."
LAURA: Yeah.

02:04:32.986 --> 02:04:35.259
MATT: "I can do that."
LAURA: All right.

02:04:35.259 --> 02:04:37.594
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

02:04:37.594 --> 02:04:38.435
MATT: "Okay."

02:04:38.435 --> 02:04:40.659
LAURA: So fun guy, what's your name?

02:04:40.659 --> 02:04:42.544
MATT: "Oh, Cymie."

02:04:42.544 --> 02:04:43.928
LAURA: Cymie?
MATT: "Cymie."

02:04:43.928 --> 02:04:46.242
LAURA: Cymie. That's Cymie.

02:04:46.242 --> 02:04:47.339
SAM: He's really sweet.

02:04:47.339 --> 02:04:48.365
LAURA: Yep.

02:04:48.365 --> 02:04:49.999
LIAM: <i>Guten tag</i>.

02:04:49.999 --> 02:04:52.689
LAURA: Okie dokie, hey, is this door locked over here?

02:04:52.689 --> 02:04:54.129
Is that a door?

02:04:54.129 --> 02:04:56.289
MATT: "That door, no, it's not locked."

02:04:56.289 --> 02:04:57.122
LAURA: Okay.

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:58.516
SAM: Is it trapped?

02:04:58.516 --> 02:04:59.599
LIAM: This door on the map,

02:04:59.599 --> 02:05:01.513
Astrid had marked with a sigil.

02:05:01.513 --> 02:05:03.300
And I still have Detect Magic up,

02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:04.141
probably for another minute or two.
MATT: Correct.

02:05:04.141 --> 02:05:05.849
As you glance over,

02:05:05.849 --> 02:05:08.949
you can see on the ground there is a faint trace of

02:05:08.949 --> 02:05:11.379
light blue scrawling that elevates slightly

02:05:11.379 --> 02:05:12.562
beyond the stone floor.

02:05:14.199 --> 02:05:17.329
LAURA: I'm just going to walk to

02:05:17.329 --> 02:05:20.872
the other corner, on the opposite.

02:05:20.872 --> 02:05:21.705
I can't--

02:05:21.705 --> 02:05:24.177
TRAVIS: You are shooting into the sky.
SAM: You are shooting backwards, up--

02:05:24.177 --> 02:05:25.398
LAURA: Shut up!

02:05:25.398 --> 02:05:26.586
I never use this thing.
MATT: Right here?

02:05:26.586 --> 02:05:29.399
No, the other-- back, other one.

02:05:29.399 --> 02:05:30.639
No.

02:05:30.639 --> 02:05:31.695
Yes.
MATT: Okay.

02:05:31.695 --> 02:05:34.719
LAURA: I'm going to stand there so he looks at me.

02:05:34.719 --> 02:05:36.501
I'm going to keep talking to him, and I'm saying:

02:05:36.501 --> 02:05:37.892
Come here! So he faces me,

02:05:37.892 --> 02:05:39.621
facing the wall, so that Caleb

02:05:39.621 --> 02:05:42.639
can dispel that magic and he won't notice it.

02:05:42.639 --> 02:05:45.679
MATT: He's standing there, staring at you, talking.

02:05:45.679 --> 02:05:47.519
LAURA: We're just talking about stuff.

02:05:47.519 --> 02:05:49.909
MATT: "Yeah, it's kind of a summer job."

02:05:49.909 --> 02:05:52.069
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. How old are you?

02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:53.286
MATT: "Me? I'm 28."

02:05:53.286 --> 02:05:54.579
LAURA: 28, that's a good age.

02:05:54.579 --> 02:05:57.199
MATT: "Thank you, yeah."
LAURA: I'm not sure how old I am.

02:05:57.199 --> 02:05:58.889
MATT: "That's weird."
LAURA: Yeah.

02:05:58.889 --> 02:06:00.819
(laughter)

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:02.619
LIAM: While you're having that conversation,

02:06:02.619 --> 02:06:04.089
not after, while you're having it,

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:06.399
I back up another 10 feet, perhaps.

02:06:06.399 --> 02:06:07.589
So I've got some range on this,

02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:11.849
and I will attempt to remove what's on the floor.

02:06:11.849 --> 02:06:13.409
MATT: All right.

02:06:13.409 --> 02:06:16.359
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.

02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:20.502
LIAM: Ten.

02:06:21.827 --> 02:06:22.935
MATT: Ten?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:06:24.369 --> 02:06:26.019
MATT: It flares up,

02:06:26.019 --> 02:06:27.955
but the sigil remains.

02:06:27.955 --> 02:06:28.788
LIAM: (sighs)

02:06:30.429 --> 02:06:31.262
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:06:33.919 --> 02:06:34.752
LIAM: 4th-level.

02:06:39.019 --> 02:06:41.392
MATT: (whooshes) Evaporates.

02:06:44.048 --> 02:06:45.224
LIAM: Veth, quickly, please.

02:06:45.224 --> 02:06:46.057
Can you have a look at this door?

02:06:46.057 --> 02:06:47.469
SAM: I'll open the door.

02:06:47.469 --> 02:06:51.559
LIAM: Just want to make sure the door is in working order.

02:06:51.559 --> 02:06:53.761
SAM: Opening the door, peering inside.

02:06:53.761 --> 02:06:55.147
MATT: (creaking) It opens up

02:06:55.147 --> 02:06:56.667
and reveals before you

02:06:57.530 --> 02:06:59.659
a darkened hallway

02:06:59.659 --> 02:07:02.575
with a faint bit of light towards the edge.

02:07:02.575 --> 02:07:03.408
Like that.

02:07:03.408 --> 02:07:05.032
SAM: No people that I can see?

02:07:07.679 --> 02:07:08.599
MATT: You see

02:07:12.094 --> 02:07:15.459
in the back of the hall, facing directly across the way,

02:07:15.459 --> 02:07:17.139
in your direction,

02:07:17.139 --> 02:07:20.989
a guard sitting with a spear and his shield at the side.

02:07:20.989 --> 02:07:24.042
Just sitting there keeping post.

02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:27.889
Because you no longer have Pass Without A Trace,

02:07:27.889 --> 02:07:29.069
I would like you to roll a stealth check.

02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.902
SAM: Sure.

02:07:33.209 --> 02:07:35.219
That is a 31.

02:07:35.219 --> 02:07:36.559
MATT: You gather he did not see you,

02:07:36.559 --> 02:07:39.399
but he did peek up at the sound of the door

02:07:39.399 --> 02:07:40.861
beginning to open.

02:07:40.861 --> 02:07:42.709
SAM: I'll go back into the room with Caleb,

02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:46.334
and very silently just say:

02:07:46.334 --> 02:07:47.234
Hey!

02:07:53.909 --> 02:07:55.949
LAURA: Yeah, she's the Ruby of the Sea.

02:07:55.949 --> 02:07:57.439
She does these huge performances,

02:07:57.439 --> 02:07:58.492
she's an amazing singer.

02:07:58.492 --> 02:07:59.749
MATT: "I've heard about her, actually."

02:07:59.749 --> 02:08:01.409
LAURA: Yeah, you should totally come out there sometime.

02:08:01.409 --> 02:08:02.563
It would be so much fun.

02:08:02.563 --> 02:08:04.786
MATT: "Oh, one day I could probably afford it." (chuckles)

02:08:04.786 --> 02:08:06.050
LIAM: First you, then me.

02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:07.349
SAM: Okay.

02:08:07.349 --> 02:08:09.432
All right, I'll prepare a bolt.

02:08:11.269 --> 02:08:16.269
And I'm going to just peer around without him seeing, and--

02:08:16.652 --> 02:08:18.439
TRAVIS: Fluffernutter.
SAM: -- kill him.

02:08:18.439 --> 02:08:20.563
MATT: Okay. So you prepare a bolt.

02:08:20.563 --> 02:08:21.901
SAM: Huh?

02:08:21.901 --> 02:08:23.499
MATT: And you go ahead and Fluffernutter.

02:08:23.499 --> 02:08:25.049
SAM: No, I'm just going to shoot.

02:08:25.049 --> 02:08:26.282
MATT: I was like, "Oh my god."

02:08:26.282 --> 02:08:28.031
SAM: I'm just going to shoot.
TRAVIS: (explosion)

02:08:28.031 --> 02:08:29.173
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:08:29.173 --> 02:08:30.556
You have an advantage,

02:08:30.556 --> 02:08:32.549
you have an advantage on the shot.

02:08:32.549 --> 02:08:34.569
LIAM: As she is doing this,

02:08:34.569 --> 02:08:36.279
I'm reaching into my components pouch

02:08:36.279 --> 02:08:37.519
to pull out an ingredient,

02:08:37.519 --> 02:08:39.109
getting ready to follow up if need be.

02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.942
MATT: You've got it.

02:08:42.999 --> 02:08:45.779
SAM: I'll take that. 19 to hit.

02:08:45.779 --> 02:08:47.172
MATT: 19 does hit.

02:08:50.769 --> 02:08:53.979
SAM: I will roll for damage, I guess.

02:08:53.979 --> 02:08:55.549
TRAVIS: Roll all of them real high.

02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:56.732
SAM: They got to be high.

02:08:58.709 --> 02:09:00.629
They're not.

02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:01.992
They're really not.

02:09:10.739 --> 02:09:14.176
SAM: 28 plus six.

02:09:14.176 --> 02:09:15.326
34.

02:09:15.326 --> 02:09:16.162
MATT: 34.

02:09:18.168 --> 02:09:19.286
(crossbow firing)

02:09:19.286 --> 02:09:20.167
(pained grunt)

02:09:21.959 --> 02:09:23.929
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: He's standing up.

02:09:23.929 --> 02:09:25.729
SAM: Bonus action, fire again.

02:09:25.729 --> 02:09:26.562
MATT: Okay.

02:09:28.399 --> 02:09:29.650
SAM: Two.

02:09:29.650 --> 02:09:31.669
(laughter)

02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:32.879
MATT: For a total of?

02:09:32.879 --> 02:09:34.247
SAM: 13.
MATT: Misses.

02:09:34.247 --> 02:09:35.080
TRAVIS: No!

02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:36.709
MATT: You freak out and fire,

02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:38.519
and this thing (whooshes) and just skids off the wall.

02:09:38.519 --> 02:09:40.859
Causing a couple of bits of stone to carve off,

02:09:40.859 --> 02:09:45.009
and you hear the sound of metal (crunching)

02:09:45.009 --> 02:09:46.169
scattering down the hallway

02:09:46.169 --> 02:09:48.830
as the bolt finds some part of the distant hallway.

02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:50.139
LIAM: I'm going to cast if I can.

02:09:50.139 --> 02:09:50.972
MATT: What are you casting?

02:09:50.972 --> 02:09:51.939
You were readying it.

02:09:51.939 --> 02:09:53.589
LIAM: Yeah, I pull out a black marble,

02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:54.869
and bring it into a circle,

02:09:54.869 --> 02:09:57.709
and I cast Gravity Sinkhole,

02:09:57.709 --> 02:10:00.819
a dunamantic spell, above him,

02:10:00.819 --> 02:10:03.881
at the ceiling to pull him up to the roof.

02:10:03.881 --> 02:10:04.856
MATT: Okay.

02:10:09.969 --> 02:10:11.590
SAM: How's Cymie doing?

02:10:11.590 --> 02:10:14.176
(laughter)

02:10:14.176 --> 02:10:16.489
LAURA: We're fast friends, you know.
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

02:10:16.489 --> 02:10:17.629
LIAM: Yeah.

02:10:17.629 --> 02:10:19.789
MATT: That's a nine.
MARISHA: This works with my plan for right now.

02:10:19.789 --> 02:10:21.439
MATT: So go ahead and roll your damage.

02:10:22.539 --> 02:10:25.609
MARISHA: Just making white noise (white noise).

02:10:25.609 --> 02:10:27.419
LIAM: 23.

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:29.940
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Force damage.

02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:32.319
And he's pulled towards the [inaudible].
MATT: As he's standing up, getting his spear,

02:10:32.319 --> 02:10:35.949
you see him go, and he inhales about to yell.

02:10:35.949 --> 02:10:39.809
And then suddenly, silently, without a word (grunts),

02:10:39.809 --> 02:10:42.309
he gets pulled up into the ceiling.

02:10:42.309 --> 02:10:46.159
Now, there is sound as his metal hits the stone above

02:10:46.159 --> 02:10:49.199
and (creaking) crinks up.

02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:51.169
The actual metal is crushed inward,

02:10:51.169 --> 02:10:54.679
and you watch as blood begins to just (squelching)

02:10:54.679 --> 02:10:55.991
slough out of the armor.

02:10:55.991 --> 02:10:57.175
ASHLEY: Goodness.

02:10:58.499 --> 02:11:01.309
MATT: And then, (metal crashing)

02:11:01.309 --> 02:11:02.259
it hits the ground.

02:11:03.749 --> 02:11:05.719
LAURA: Don't worry about that.

02:11:05.719 --> 02:11:07.239
It's fine, you know what?
MATT: "What happened?"

02:11:07.239 --> 02:11:08.247
LAURA: I don't even know.

02:11:08.247 --> 02:11:09.080
MATT: "I should check that, it's my job."

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:10.905
LAURA: No, you should--

02:11:10.905 --> 02:11:12.159
You should hang out with me.

02:11:12.159 --> 02:11:14.512
MATT: "You're right, okay."

02:11:14.512 --> 02:11:17.479
MATT: Because he's charmed, he stays.
TRAVIS: You recycled him!

02:11:17.479 --> 02:11:19.303
SAM: I just kind of look at Caleb.

02:11:19.303 --> 02:11:21.779
(laughter)

02:11:21.779 --> 02:11:24.909
MATT: Mind you, there are three other doors in this hallway,

02:11:24.909 --> 02:11:27.199
and that made a lot of sound.
SAM: Sure, sure.

02:11:27.199 --> 02:11:29.199
MATT: Do you want to do anything?

02:11:29.199 --> 02:11:30.032
SAM: Yeah.

02:11:30.999 --> 02:11:33.302
LIAM: No actually, let's just let this play out.

02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:34.993
LAURA: What?

02:11:34.993 --> 02:11:37.049
LIAM: I'm going to step just inside the door.

02:11:37.049 --> 02:11:37.919
SAM: Oh god.

02:11:37.919 --> 02:11:38.752
LIAM: And wait.

02:11:38.752 --> 02:11:40.299
MATT: The door is now open.

02:11:40.299 --> 02:11:41.289
LIAM: Just in the doorway,

02:11:41.289 --> 02:11:43.999
so that Jester's new friend can't see me.

02:11:43.999 --> 02:11:45.439
I should be able to see

02:11:45.439 --> 02:11:47.979
with the last moments of Detect Magic

02:11:47.979 --> 02:11:51.795
if there is anything at that first door on the left.

02:11:51.795 --> 02:11:52.628
MATT: Hmm.

02:11:54.689 --> 02:11:56.409
LAURA: We're going straight to the back though, right,

02:11:56.409 --> 02:11:57.409
by the bloody guard?

02:11:58.909 --> 02:11:59.742
LIAM: Yeah.

02:12:01.459 --> 02:12:05.282
SAM: I'm going to cast a quick Message to Beau saying:

02:12:06.913 --> 02:12:09.342
Sarsaparil-licorice?

02:12:09.342 --> 02:12:12.055
(laughter)

02:12:12.055 --> 02:12:13.749
MATT: And as that happens, we cut over to you,

02:12:13.749 --> 02:12:15.632
still there on the top of the tower.

02:12:17.505 --> 02:12:19.189
MARISHA: I just go:

02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:20.364
Same.

02:12:21.879 --> 02:12:24.612
And upon hearing this, I'm just going to roll over.

02:12:25.539 --> 02:12:27.579
I'm a very quietly crawl,

02:12:27.579 --> 02:12:30.449
and I want to get behind this guy.

02:12:30.449 --> 02:12:32.519
And in this time

02:12:32.519 --> 02:12:33.909
I'm pulling out...

02:12:35.409 --> 02:12:39.969
These two acid vials that I got from Veth

02:12:40.949 --> 02:12:42.802
a long time ago.

02:12:44.249 --> 02:12:45.989
And maybe a dagger,

02:12:45.989 --> 02:12:49.452
and I'm just having it ready and I'm just waiting.

02:12:50.289 --> 02:12:51.122
MATT: Okay.

02:12:51.122 --> 02:12:52.838
TRAVIS: You're setting out tools.

02:12:52.838 --> 02:12:53.889
(laughter)

02:12:53.889 --> 02:12:55.089
Like that's an option!

02:12:56.219 --> 02:12:57.439
Not sure which.

02:12:57.439 --> 02:13:00.199
MARISHA: Like a fucking serial killer.

02:13:00.199 --> 02:13:01.976
TRAVIS: You Dexter the sleeping guard.

02:13:02.959 --> 02:13:04.392
MARISHA: White gloves.

02:13:04.392 --> 02:13:08.179
MATT: Only the most fucked up of assassins kill their

02:13:08.179 --> 02:13:09.169
victims with acid.

02:13:09.169 --> 02:13:11.870
TRAVIS: He wakes up and he's like, "Why acid or a dagger?"

02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:13.159
(laughter)

02:13:13.159 --> 02:13:15.969
MARISHA: I don't know how this is going to play out.

02:13:15.969 --> 02:13:17.219
MATT: I'm excited for this.

02:13:17.219 --> 02:13:19.119
MARISHA: Is he still super asleep,

02:13:19.119 --> 02:13:20.786
is he still snoring?
MATT: He's still snoring.

02:13:24.279 --> 02:13:25.919
As you wait and prep yourself there,

02:13:25.919 --> 02:13:26.949
contemplating the tools before you.
MARISHA: And I also pull out

02:13:26.949 --> 02:13:29.629
my bag of ball bearings, just in case.

02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:31.879
(laughter)

02:13:32.957 --> 02:13:35.269
Yeah, Boulder, Parchment, Shears, I've got them all.

02:13:35.269 --> 02:13:37.739
MATT: This is some ritualistic stuff.

02:13:37.739 --> 02:13:39.639
This is some before bedtime...

02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:42.599
I love it. Okay.

02:13:42.599 --> 02:13:43.779
Cutting back to you.

02:13:43.779 --> 02:13:45.689
As you're there waiting...

02:13:46.789 --> 02:13:48.449
You hear some voices.

02:13:48.449 --> 02:13:49.649
SAM: Uh-oh.

02:13:49.649 --> 02:13:52.389
MATT: Not quite certain which direction it's coming from,

02:13:52.389 --> 02:13:55.393
and you hear the sound of metal footfalls

02:13:55.393 --> 02:13:58.739
(footsteps)

02:13:58.739 --> 02:14:01.949
SAM: I'll cast Silent Image.

02:14:01.949 --> 02:14:03.747
MATT: What's your silent image?

02:14:03.747 --> 02:14:06.599
SAM: That guard.

02:14:06.599 --> 02:14:08.887
MATT: The crushed one on the floor
that's in a puddle of blood?

02:14:08.887 --> 02:14:10.869
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to have him just stand up,

02:14:10.869 --> 02:14:14.269
and just an image of him just be walking down the hall.

02:14:14.269 --> 02:14:16.469
Like he's going back and forth,

02:14:16.469 --> 02:14:17.302
stretching his legs or something.

02:14:17.302 --> 02:14:19.519
LIAM: Does that erase the body on the floor?

02:14:19.519 --> 02:14:20.579
SAM: Maybe they'll just look at him,

02:14:20.579 --> 02:14:23.249
and not the body on the floor.
MATT: It does not erase the body on the floor.

02:14:23.249 --> 02:14:24.499
The door opens.

02:14:24.499 --> 02:14:25.349
LIAM: Yeah.

02:14:25.349 --> 02:14:26.759
MATT: And another guard...

02:14:28.099 --> 02:14:29.132
Pokes through.

02:14:30.739 --> 02:14:34.019
Glances over at the illusion of the guard that you've left,

02:14:34.019 --> 02:14:37.751
which currently is walking this way down the hall.

02:14:37.751 --> 02:14:40.242
And just goes, "Everything all right?"

02:14:42.266 --> 02:14:43.682
SAM: He just nods.

02:14:51.389 --> 02:14:53.142
MATT: The other guard is standing out there goes,

02:14:54.889 --> 02:14:55.722
"Shit."

02:14:57.221 --> 02:14:59.363
Then he goes to run back into the room.

02:15:00.209 --> 02:15:01.042
What are you doing?

02:15:01.042 --> 02:15:03.384
LIAM: I put another fissure right at that doorway.

02:15:03.384 --> 02:15:04.217
SAM: A fissure?

02:15:04.217 --> 02:15:06.027
LIAM: A sinkhole, excuse me.
MATT: Another sinkhole?

02:15:06.027 --> 02:15:08.589
LIAM: To pull him back into the-- back into the hall.

02:15:08.589 --> 02:15:10.029
SAM: It's a blood bath.

02:15:10.029 --> 02:15:10.862
MATT: 13.

02:15:13.045 --> 02:15:14.064
TRAVIS: Crunch!

02:15:14.064 --> 02:15:16.179
MARISHA: Yeah!
TALIESIN: One more and we have--

02:15:16.179 --> 02:15:17.922
SAM: This is a horror film.

02:15:17.922 --> 02:15:19.737
LIAM: 28.
MATT: 28.

02:15:19.737 --> 02:15:21.769
TRAVIS: These fucking necklaces better be there.

02:15:21.769 --> 02:15:24.824
MATT: So suddenly as he turns to go out of the room,

02:15:24.824 --> 02:15:26.079
(whooshing) he gets yanked out,

02:15:26.079 --> 02:15:29.959
and slams into the ceiling (grunting).

02:15:29.959 --> 02:15:31.819
SAM: I'll finish him off,

02:15:31.819 --> 02:15:33.449
is he still alive?

02:15:33.449 --> 02:15:35.349
MATT: He's currently yelling in pain

02:15:35.349 --> 02:15:37.269
as he's being crushed against the ceiling.

02:15:37.269 --> 02:15:39.042
SAM: I'll shoot him.
MATT: Go ahead!

02:15:39.042 --> 02:15:41.469
(laughter)

02:15:41.469 --> 02:15:42.674
SAM: Natural 20.

02:15:42.674 --> 02:15:44.769
(laughter)

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:46.344
MARISHA: Oh ho ho!

02:15:46.344 --> 02:15:48.379
MATT: Now you hadn't hid before this happened.

02:15:48.379 --> 02:15:51.109
SAM: No, I didn't know if he saw me.

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:52.309
MATT: Correct.

02:15:52.309 --> 02:15:53.739
SAM: So maybe not sneak attack.

02:15:53.739 --> 02:15:55.120
MATT: I'd say you would be hidden,

02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.359
in a sense that they didn't know you were there.

02:15:56.359 --> 02:15:58.329
LIAM: Perhaps she's hidden by all the blood in his eyes.

02:15:58.329 --> 02:15:59.919
MATT: Fair enough.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:15:59.919 --> 02:16:01.797
MATT: I'll say yeah, take the roll the advantage,

02:16:01.797 --> 02:16:03.222
you got a natural 20, you get it.

02:16:03.222 --> 02:16:06.222
MARISHA: His eyeballs imploded, so it's fine.

02:16:06.222 --> 02:16:07.072
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:16:07.072 --> 02:16:08.255
LIAM: I've always loved Akira.

02:16:09.212 --> 02:16:11.209
TALIESIN: I mean, we all knew how this was going to go.

02:16:11.209 --> 02:16:12.909
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course.
TALIESIN: Let's not pretend there were any illusions.

02:16:12.909 --> 02:16:14.336
TRAVIS: There was always a chance, but--

02:16:14.336 --> 02:16:15.259
MARISHA: But yeah.

02:16:15.259 --> 02:16:17.919
ASHLEY: So you're telling me there's a chance.

02:16:17.919 --> 02:16:21.619
SAM: Also, a terribly low roll, but still 28.

02:16:21.619 --> 02:16:24.501
MATT: 28 with the crit? Double it.
SAM: Oh crit, so doubled, yeah.

02:16:24.501 --> 02:16:26.259
MATT: Or double the dice at least.

02:16:26.259 --> 02:16:28.929
SAM: Double the dice. Yeah, so that's 50.

02:16:28.929 --> 02:16:30.152
MATT: Yeah, no, he's gone.

02:16:31.068 --> 02:16:35.345
(pained grunt) You hear him he just goes (groans).

02:16:36.508 --> 02:16:39.059
(crashing) Onto the ground again.

02:16:39.059 --> 02:16:41.289
There's now these

02:16:41.289 --> 02:16:43.219
two crushed.

02:16:43.219 --> 02:16:45.319
LIAM: -- damage when they hit.

02:16:45.319 --> 02:16:46.152
LAURA: Okay.

02:16:47.259 --> 02:16:50.249
MATT: There are now two bloodied suits of crushed armor.

02:16:50.249 --> 02:16:53.672
SAM: Unfortunately, my bolt-- it shoots again.

02:16:54.630 --> 02:16:55.463
MARISHA: Oh.

02:16:55.463 --> 02:16:57.309
MATT: It's fine, you lose another bolt,

02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:58.429
it skitters down the hallway.

02:16:58.429 --> 02:17:01.489
It hasn't made as much noise as the second body

02:17:01.489 --> 02:17:03.599
covered in bloodied armor slamming

02:17:03.599 --> 02:17:05.799
10 feet onto the stone floor.

02:17:05.799 --> 02:17:07.899
You hear a voice come from inside of that room

02:17:07.899 --> 02:17:10.539
and go, "What the fuck?"

02:17:10.539 --> 02:17:11.529
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

02:17:11.529 --> 02:17:13.092
SAM: Okay.

02:17:13.092 --> 02:17:14.629
MARISHA: Are any of the guards on the outside

02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:16.719
hearing any of this, are they alarmed yet?

02:17:16.719 --> 02:17:19.329
MATT: No, you do not hear any of this.
MARISHA: Great, good.

02:17:19.329 --> 02:17:21.219
TRAVIS: I'm sure it's going fine.

02:17:21.219 --> 02:17:23.419
We've talked about this ad nauseum.

02:17:23.419 --> 02:17:24.882
LIAM: As soon as the body hits the ground,

02:17:25.814 --> 02:17:26.905
Sarsaparilla.

02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:28.309
(laughter)

02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:29.449
MATT: Are you staying at that doorway?

02:17:29.449 --> 02:17:30.999
SAM: We've got to go kill this guy.

02:17:32.169 --> 02:17:33.159
MARISHA: Who are you telling Sarsaparilla?

02:17:33.159 --> 02:17:34.139
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, you.

02:17:34.139 --> 02:17:34.989
MARISHA: Me?
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

02:17:34.989 --> 02:17:37.239
Yeah, I start stalking towards the doorway.

02:17:38.239 --> 02:17:40.469
SAM: But with a grim expression of--

02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:41.979
LIAM: Sure.
SAM: -- murder.

02:17:41.979 --> 02:17:43.169
LIAM: Sure.

02:17:43.169 --> 02:17:44.649
TRAVIS: Do you grab some blood

02:17:44.649 --> 02:17:46.268
and splatter it onto your face?

02:17:46.268 --> 02:17:47.101
LIAM: I don't need it.

02:17:47.959 --> 02:17:50.379
MATT: Your new friend, Jester, is like (sighs).

02:17:50.379 --> 02:17:51.834
He's getting nervous, looking over his shoulder,

02:17:51.834 --> 02:17:54.019
he's like, "Ah, I really should get to work.

02:17:54.019 --> 02:17:54.852
"There's some...

02:17:55.809 --> 02:17:57.716
"Your friends are knocking around over there."

02:17:57.716 --> 02:18:00.749
LAURA: Yeah, they just like to have some fun sometimes.

02:18:00.749 --> 02:18:03.008
I say with like a tear forming in my eye.

02:18:03.008 --> 02:18:04.269
(laughter)

02:18:04.269 --> 02:18:05.772
MATT: "Don't cry, don't cry!

02:18:05.772 --> 02:18:07.856
"You should have some fun, too. You deserve it."

02:18:07.856 --> 02:18:10.469
LAURA: You do, too, you deserve to have some fun.

02:18:10.469 --> 02:18:11.409
MATT: "Thank you."

02:18:11.409 --> 02:18:14.289
LAURA: I'm so glad that I came in this room first,

02:18:14.289 --> 02:18:16.390
because I really like you, Cymie.

02:18:16.390 --> 02:18:18.390
MATT: "Oh, well, thank you. I like you, too."

02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:20.439
LAURA: I like you.

02:18:20.439 --> 02:18:22.272
MATT: "Yeah, I'm sure it's not too bad."

02:18:23.449 --> 02:18:24.899
LAURA: Yeah.

02:18:24.899 --> 02:18:26.515
MATT: "My friend Jasper got me the job actually."

02:18:26.515 --> 02:18:28.189
(exclamations)

02:18:28.189 --> 02:18:29.279
LAURA: He sounds very nice.

02:18:29.279 --> 02:18:30.599
MATT: "Yeah, he's a good dude.

02:18:30.599 --> 02:18:31.779
"He's a bit dense at times,

02:18:31.779 --> 02:18:32.959
"but overall, he's got a good heart, you know?"

02:18:32.959 --> 02:18:34.915
LAURA: (whimpering) That's really wonderful.

02:18:34.915 --> 02:18:36.347
Can you do me a favor, Cymie,

02:18:36.347 --> 02:18:38.699
and just sit down and stay here at this table.

02:18:38.699 --> 02:18:40.599
Don't get up at all.
MATT: "Sure, okay. Yeah, no worries."

02:18:40.599 --> 02:18:41.432
He sits right down.

02:18:41.432 --> 02:18:43.539
LAURA: Do you know what, close your eyes if you can.

02:18:43.539 --> 02:18:44.966
Just stay here, okay?

02:18:44.966 --> 02:18:46.742
MATT: "You got it, okay."

02:18:46.742 --> 02:18:47.575
LAURA: Oh god.

02:18:47.575 --> 02:18:49.679
MATT: "Should I count as well?"

02:18:49.679 --> 02:18:50.512
LAURA: What?

02:18:50.512 --> 02:18:51.907
MATT: "Should I count as well?"

02:18:51.907 --> 02:18:53.756
LAURA: Count really quietly, hon,

02:18:53.756 --> 02:18:56.729
and I just walk away. I walk out into the hallway, too.

02:18:56.729 --> 02:18:57.895
MATT: All right, and he's just

02:18:57.895 --> 02:19:00.225
quietly counting to himself with his eyes closed.

02:19:00.225 --> 02:19:03.146
SAM: Jester, we're about to go kill this guard.

02:19:03.146 --> 02:19:04.479
LAURA: No!

02:19:04.479 --> 02:19:05.985
SAM: Can you do something else?

02:19:05.985 --> 02:19:09.248
LAURA: Well, that's a concentration, Cymie.

02:19:09.248 --> 02:19:11.779
I have to really think about it.

02:19:11.779 --> 02:19:13.789
Okay, wait, let me see.

02:19:13.789 --> 02:19:16.169
SAM: I could try to distract him,

02:19:16.169 --> 02:19:17.469
or we could crush him.

02:19:17.469 --> 02:19:18.379
MATT: While this is happening,

02:19:18.379 --> 02:19:21.129
Caleb, you've walked to the doorway.

02:19:21.129 --> 02:19:21.962
You look in?

02:19:21.962 --> 02:19:23.519
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Vader is in the doorway.

02:19:23.519 --> 02:19:25.889
MATT: As you step into the doorway, you reveal

02:19:25.889 --> 02:19:27.989
it looks to be some sort of an armory.

02:19:33.249 --> 02:19:36.499
With one guard right there at the edge of the door.

02:19:36.499 --> 02:19:38.209
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: And one that's in the back.

02:19:38.209 --> 02:19:39.969
The one of the edge of the door

02:19:39.969 --> 02:19:42.119
was ready with its blade up,

02:19:42.119 --> 02:19:44.419
and as soon as you step even close to him--

02:19:44.419 --> 02:19:45.361
LIAM: I step--

02:19:45.361 --> 02:19:47.929
MATT: No, as soon as you even
get close he leans around the way

02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:48.999
and goes-- (exclaims with force)

02:19:48.999 --> 02:19:50.489
And goes to make a strike on you.

02:19:50.489 --> 02:19:52.089
LIAM: Great, sure, makes sense.

02:19:53.749 --> 02:19:56.007
MATT: Kind of shifting into the space.

02:19:58.989 --> 02:20:00.919
Making two attacks.

02:20:00.919 --> 02:20:02.269
An 18.

02:20:02.269 --> 02:20:03.389
LIAM: Shield.

02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:05.189
MATT: Misses.

02:20:05.189 --> 02:20:06.902
MATT: Ooh, 23.

02:20:08.449 --> 02:20:09.282
LIAM: Just hits.

02:20:09.282 --> 02:20:10.809
MATT: Just hits.

02:20:10.809 --> 02:20:12.429
So the first one-- (sword swiping)

02:20:12.429 --> 02:20:13.509
is deflected off to the side.

02:20:13.509 --> 02:20:15.899
And you see a arcing flash of arcane energy

02:20:15.899 --> 02:20:17.619
just shooting it off to the edge.

02:20:17.619 --> 02:20:19.329
It hits the stone on the side of the door

02:20:19.329 --> 02:20:21.319
and then picks up and arcs it backward.

02:20:21.319 --> 02:20:23.669
And it pushes just through the arcane shield

02:20:23.669 --> 02:20:25.649
slamming into you for...

02:20:28.179 --> 02:20:29.769
10 points of slashing damage.

02:20:29.769 --> 02:20:31.192
LIAM: Okay.

02:20:32.369 --> 02:20:34.359
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:20:35.489 --> 02:20:37.669
MATT: The other one is going to rush forward--

02:20:37.669 --> 02:20:40.409
actually, he should have a spear.

02:20:40.409 --> 02:20:41.997
Because he's going to go ahead and

02:20:41.997 --> 02:20:43.349
come over his friend's shoulder,

02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:45.889
and attempt to strike you in the space between.

02:20:45.889 --> 02:20:49.012
They're phalanxing in this little gap here.

02:20:50.689 --> 02:20:53.419
That is going to be a 20, which you still have shield up.

02:20:53.419 --> 02:20:55.269
LIAM: Right, shield's up.
MATT: It misses.

02:20:55.269 --> 02:20:56.449
MATT: Both miss.

02:20:56.449 --> 02:20:58.081
MATT: It just-- (sword swiping)

02:20:58.081 --> 02:21:00.689
arcing off the bubble of defensive

02:21:00.689 --> 02:21:01.922
Abjuration energy.

02:21:03.519 --> 02:21:04.929
LAURA: Can we do anything?

02:21:04.929 --> 02:21:05.839
LIAM: You can roll for initiative.

02:21:05.839 --> 02:21:06.956
MATT: Now we roll for initiative.

02:21:06.956 --> 02:21:09.132
LAURA: Can I run for-- okay.

02:21:09.132 --> 02:21:10.419
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

02:21:10.419 --> 02:21:12.379
ASHLEY: You know, I have a really good feeling about this,

02:21:12.379 --> 02:21:15.038
I think they're doing really good in there.

02:21:15.038 --> 02:21:17.259
TALIESIN: I think everything's coming up Gail.

02:21:17.259 --> 02:21:19.126
ASHLEY: We haven't heard a word, just "sarsaparilla",

02:21:19.126 --> 02:21:21.339
and I'm feeling positive.

02:21:21.339 --> 02:21:22.873
MATT: 25 to 20.

02:21:22.873 --> 02:21:24.284
LAURA: 22.

02:21:24.284 --> 02:21:25.673
SAM: 22.

02:21:25.673 --> 02:21:26.723
LIAM: Nice.
MARISHA: It's those endorphins,

02:21:26.723 --> 02:21:28.815
still lasting from last night.

02:21:28.815 --> 02:21:30.841
MATT: (chuckles)

02:21:30.841 --> 02:21:33.017
MATT: 20 to 15.

02:21:33.017 --> 02:21:34.784
15 to 10.
LIAM: 13.

02:21:37.417 --> 02:21:38.667
MATT: All right.

02:21:40.598 --> 02:21:42.859
Jester and Veth, you're up first.

02:21:42.859 --> 02:21:44.932
LAURA: I'm going to run forward and just...

02:21:47.899 --> 02:21:51.882
I'm going to shout-- at 2nd-level.

02:21:53.409 --> 02:21:56.169
I'm going to run to where I can see the guards,

02:21:56.169 --> 02:21:58.339
where the noise is happening.

02:21:58.339 --> 02:21:59.172
Can I get at least--

02:21:59.172 --> 02:22:01.163
MATT: You were over here, you rush over to where

02:22:01.163 --> 02:22:04.388
all this chaos is happening after you told him to sit.

02:22:04.388 --> 02:22:06.002
LAURA: Yeah, so I was at the doorway, yeah.

02:22:06.002 --> 02:22:09.130
MATT: Right. You were here at that point.

02:22:09.130 --> 02:22:12.109
Four, five, six-- all you see is Caleb in the doorway.

02:22:12.109 --> 02:22:13.779
You do not have an angle to see anybody,

02:22:13.779 --> 02:22:16.069
you see a spear pushing through from the side,

02:22:16.069 --> 02:22:19.129
but you do not have visual on the two guards.

02:22:19.129 --> 02:22:22.777
They are inside the room and you do not have a vantage.

02:22:23.722 --> 02:22:25.847
LAURA: Oh-h-h-kay.

02:22:26.899 --> 02:22:29.512
Then I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

02:22:29.512 --> 02:22:30.662
MATT: All righty.

02:22:33.323 --> 02:22:34.348
Where are you putting--?

02:22:34.348 --> 02:22:36.509
LAURA: I'm going to put my duplicate...

02:22:37.679 --> 02:22:39.821
behind Caleb.

02:22:39.821 --> 02:22:40.812
MATT: All righty.
LAURA: A little bit,

02:22:40.812 --> 02:22:42.539
like five feet behind Caleb.

02:22:42.539 --> 02:22:43.939
So there's a little bit of a gap.

02:22:43.939 --> 02:22:44.772
MATT: You got it.

02:22:44.772 --> 02:22:46.260
LAURA: And she's going to say...

02:22:47.176 --> 02:22:48.484
um...

02:22:51.803 --> 02:22:54.298
(laughs)

02:22:54.298 --> 02:22:57.217
She's going to say, "Hey, (mumbles).

02:22:57.217 --> 02:22:58.050
Fuck off, kids."

02:22:58.050 --> 02:23:01.153
I don't know, she's going to say, "Come over here."

02:23:01.153 --> 02:23:01.986
MATT: Okay.

02:23:01.986 --> 02:23:03.835
SAM: "Come on, fuck off kids"?
LAURA: Come on, fuck off kids.

02:23:03.835 --> 02:23:05.093
I mean, hit me!

02:23:05.093 --> 02:23:06.136
I don't know.

02:23:06.136 --> 02:23:07.224
(laughter)
MATT: Caleb,

02:23:07.224 --> 02:23:09.589
from your standpoint, as you're now--

02:23:09.589 --> 02:23:10.896
a little bit of blood now

02:23:10.896 --> 02:23:12.589
from the gash that got you in the shoulder.

02:23:12.589 --> 02:23:14.905
You're holding your hands up
and blades are shooting past you.

02:23:14.905 --> 02:23:16.869
Both the guards just go--

02:23:16.869 --> 02:23:18.177
LAURA: Oh that's-- yeah.

02:23:18.177 --> 02:23:21.003
MATT: Both of them just look past you like, "Huh?"

02:23:21.003 --> 02:23:22.599
LAURA: Do I have any bonus?

02:23:22.599 --> 02:23:23.799
LIAM: Yeah, he's bleeding.

02:23:23.799 --> 02:23:26.839
He's looking at these guys with just 15 years of experience

02:23:26.839 --> 02:23:28.979
causing murder to rise in his eyes.

02:23:28.979 --> 02:23:30.904
And he's suddenly got like, "Hey!"

02:23:30.904 --> 02:23:33.519
(laughter)

02:23:33.519 --> 02:23:34.559
MATT: All righty.

02:23:34.559 --> 02:23:36.449
So that's your movement and your action.

02:23:36.449 --> 02:23:37.282
You good?

02:23:37.282 --> 02:23:38.619
LAURA: Y-y-yes.

02:23:38.619 --> 02:23:39.452
MATT: Okay.

02:23:39.452 --> 02:23:40.869
Finishing Jester's go, Veth, what are you doing?

02:23:40.869 --> 02:23:45.159
SAM: I run down the hall, probably bonus action, dash.

02:23:45.159 --> 02:23:46.317
MATT: 30--

02:23:47.239 --> 02:23:49.029
MATT: Yeah, and from there you can see past Caleb

02:23:49.029 --> 02:23:51.579
to the guard that's currently harrying him directly.

02:23:51.579 --> 02:23:55.480
SAM: I will try to take them out without killing them.

02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:57.836
I will cast...

02:23:57.836 --> 02:24:00.729
I will throw some buttons and cast Hypnotic Pattern,

02:24:00.729 --> 02:24:03.359
inside the room behind them.

02:24:03.359 --> 02:24:04.192
MATT: Ooh.

02:24:07.337 --> 02:24:11.579
SAM: Glowing, twisting, colorful
buttons weave through the air

02:24:11.579 --> 02:24:15.974
behind them, distracting and hopefully charming them?

02:24:15.974 --> 02:24:19.549
MATT: Inside a 30 foot cube, which you can direct here?

02:24:19.549 --> 02:24:21.492
SAM: Yeah, so it doesn't hit Caleb.

02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:23.739
MATT: It's tough in this space.

02:24:24.915 --> 02:24:26.881
TRAVIS: It's a small space.
MATT: It's a small space.

02:24:26.881 --> 02:24:28.149
It's a 30 foot cube,

02:24:28.149 --> 02:24:29.757
I'll say you can...

02:24:36.275 --> 02:24:37.575
Ugh.

02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:40.099
Well, you cast it.

02:24:40.099 --> 02:24:43.709
SAM: I can't tell it to go way at the back of the room?

02:24:43.709 --> 02:24:45.709
MATT: Even at the furthest point of the room,

02:24:45.709 --> 02:24:46.979
the cube is going to fill the room

02:24:46.979 --> 02:24:48.159
and spill into the space.

02:24:48.159 --> 02:24:52.299
SAM: You can't place the center of your cube

02:24:52.299 --> 02:24:54.419
in a space you can't see, I guess.

02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:56.906
MATT: Correct.
SAM: Got it.

02:24:56.906 --> 02:24:58.418
(whispering) 30-foot cube.

02:24:58.418 --> 02:24:59.799
I'm going to try it anyway and see if it works.

02:24:59.799 --> 02:25:00.999
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:25:00.999 --> 02:25:05.229
I need Caleb and Veth to make a wisdom saving throw.

02:25:05.229 --> 02:25:07.539
TRAVIS: Of which you have advantage.

02:25:07.539 --> 02:25:09.039
SAM: Well, you don't anymore.

02:25:09.039 --> 02:25:10.206
MATT: Correct.

02:25:11.059 --> 02:25:13.337
MATT: Because this spell takes
concentration, so it's just a single roll.

02:25:13.337 --> 02:25:16.259
SAM: I can cast it on <i>myself</i>?

02:25:16.259 --> 02:25:17.092
MATT: Mm-hmm!

02:25:17.092 --> 02:25:18.349
You can hit yourself with a fireball,

02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:20.201
you can do all kinds of cool shit.

02:25:20.201 --> 02:25:23.201
LIAM: Yep.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:25:23.201 --> 02:25:24.839
Oh, boy.
MARISHA: Wow.

02:25:24.839 --> 02:25:27.109
MATT: Each creature in the area, and you were in the area.

02:25:27.109 --> 02:25:28.609
SAM: Okay.

02:25:28.609 --> 02:25:30.372
It has a 16 save.

02:25:31.239 --> 02:25:32.159
MARISHA: Whoops.

02:25:32.159 --> 02:25:33.899
MATT: Actually 30 foot in the back there,

02:25:33.899 --> 02:25:35.319
you would be just outside of it.

02:25:35.319 --> 02:25:37.776
Just barely, it flashes and you're like--

02:25:37.776 --> 02:25:38.939
It catches you a little bit,

02:25:38.939 --> 02:25:41.429
and your eyes sparkle and you shake it off.

02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:42.262
LIAM: 18.

02:25:42.262 --> 02:25:43.095
MATT: 18, okay.

02:25:43.095 --> 02:25:46.091
So you both manage to shake it off.

02:25:46.091 --> 02:25:48.280
MARISHA, LAURA and TALIESIN: ♪ Shake it off, shake it off ♪

02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:49.539
SAM: I've never heard that song, what is it?

02:25:49.539 --> 02:25:51.559
MATT: The one that's in the door with the sword,

02:25:51.559 --> 02:25:53.069
that was just hacking into Caleb

02:25:53.069 --> 02:25:55.246
and looked past the confused Jester,

02:25:55.246 --> 02:25:56.079
looks over his shoulder,

02:25:56.079 --> 02:25:58.396
sees the flash and is now going like--

02:25:59.339 --> 02:26:00.172
LAURA: How long does that last?

02:26:00.172 --> 02:26:02.563
MATT: And is just standing, staring at it.
SAM: A minute.

02:26:02.563 --> 02:26:04.129
MATT: The guard behind him is like,

02:26:04.129 --> 02:26:06.619
he's sees the flash coming, closes his eyes

02:26:06.619 --> 02:26:08.036
and looks up and he's like,

02:26:08.036 --> 02:26:09.439
"Come on, help, what are you doing?"

02:26:09.439 --> 02:26:10.272
And he's got the spear,

02:26:10.272 --> 02:26:12.129
and he's trying to hit around his friend,

02:26:12.129 --> 02:26:14.737
who's now blocking him standing in the space there.

02:26:14.737 --> 02:26:16.630
SAM: Okay, okay.

02:26:18.229 --> 02:26:19.179
That's my go.

02:26:19.179 --> 02:26:21.379
MATT: All righty, that brings us to Caleb.

02:26:21.379 --> 02:26:24.239
LIAM: I hold up Allura's staff,
and pull electricity off of it,

02:26:24.239 --> 02:26:26.979
and fire lightening bolts straight to the both of them.

02:26:26.979 --> 02:26:29.177
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Whoa, cold.

02:26:30.579 --> 02:26:31.909
I forgot.

02:26:31.909 --> 02:26:35.310
I forgot we travel with a stone cold murderer.

02:26:35.310 --> 02:26:36.784
(laughter)

02:26:36.784 --> 02:26:38.805
TALIESIN: This is the first use of this staff.

02:26:38.805 --> 02:26:40.047
MATT: 16 and 17.

02:26:41.688 --> 02:26:42.989
LIAM: Nope.

02:26:42.989 --> 02:26:45.330
18.
MATT: 18, both fail.

02:26:45.330 --> 02:26:48.099
TALIESIN: Jesus.
ASHLEY: That's a lot of dice.

02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:50.209
TRAVIS: Somebody brought a grenade
launcher to the paintball game.

02:26:50.209 --> 02:26:53.484
(laughter)

02:26:53.484 --> 02:26:55.342
TALIESIN: That sounded like an avalanche.

02:26:55.342 --> 02:26:56.250
TRAVIS: (explosion)

02:26:56.250 --> 02:26:57.284
SAM: We've all met that guy.

02:26:57.284 --> 02:26:58.975
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say,
we all know who the rich kid is.

02:26:58.975 --> 02:27:00.658
MATT: 41?
LIAM: 43.

02:27:01.577 --> 02:27:03.319
SAM: We're only using rentals, dude.

02:27:03.319 --> 02:27:06.461
(laughter)

02:27:06.461 --> 02:27:08.860
(gruff voice) "I brought little Betty."
(gun cocking noise)

02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:10.219
MATT: Actually, the first guy was incapacitated,

02:27:10.219 --> 02:27:11.359
so he failed automatically,

02:27:11.359 --> 02:27:12.897
but it's same thing.

02:27:12.897 --> 02:27:15.089
LAURA: Is it worse if they're wearing metal armor?

02:27:15.089 --> 02:27:17.469
LIAM: Well, they fail their save--

02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:18.919
MATT: No, but I'm complementing if I want to

02:27:18.919 --> 02:27:21.189
go with an old school D&amp;D ruling that I love.

02:27:21.189 --> 02:27:22.339
LIAM: Oh, a bouncy bounce?

02:27:22.339 --> 02:27:24.319
MATT: Yeah.

02:27:24.319 --> 02:27:27.585
So as you release the bolt of lightning,

02:27:27.585 --> 02:27:29.369
(whooshing) it arcs forward,

02:27:29.369 --> 02:27:31.259
through both of them-- (electrified grunts)

02:27:31.259 --> 02:27:33.749
Hits the back wall, shoots back,

02:27:33.749 --> 02:27:36.069
bouncing off of it, back in your direction.

02:27:36.069 --> 02:27:37.679
Both of you make dexterity saving throws for me.

02:27:37.679 --> 02:27:39.879
MARISHA: (giggles) This is awesome.

02:27:39.879 --> 02:27:42.759
TRAVIS: Yes, these are just guards.
SAM: 14.

02:27:42.759 --> 02:27:45.389
LIAM: I'll pass it with my Ring Of Evasion.

02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:46.780
MATT: Okay.

02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:48.055
I'm not doing full damage,

02:27:48.055 --> 02:27:49.959
just half damage to you unless you make the save,

02:27:49.959 --> 02:27:53.179
which you did not, so you...

02:27:53.179 --> 02:27:55.057
With evasion ,if you fail, you still get--
LIAM: Half damage.

02:27:55.057 --> 02:27:56.989
MATT: Half damage anyway, right?
LIAM: --if you succeed.

02:27:56.989 --> 02:27:58.805
MATT: Right, okay, so a quarter damage,

02:27:58.805 --> 02:28:00.589
so we'll say ten points of lightning damage.

02:28:00.589 --> 02:28:02.109
SAM: Great.

02:28:02.109 --> 02:28:03.175
MATT: And you the same, 10 points.

02:28:03.175 --> 02:28:05.525
SAM: Oh wait, I'm resistant to lightning now.

02:28:05.525 --> 02:28:06.359
LAURA: What?

02:28:06.359 --> 02:28:08.009
MATT: So five points to lightning damage.

02:28:08.009 --> 02:28:08.975
LAURA: Why?

02:28:08.975 --> 02:28:11.362
SAM: Because I've got this...

02:28:11.362 --> 02:28:13.119
I've got this thing.

02:28:13.119 --> 02:28:16.009
I've got Yussa's Eldritch Blast,

02:28:16.009 --> 02:28:17.209
or whatever it's called.

02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:19.669
TALIESIN: Eldritch Blast.

02:28:19.669 --> 02:28:21.119
SAM: Blast Scepter.

02:28:21.119 --> 02:28:22.469
LAURA: Oh yeah, that thing.

02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:23.302
TALIESIN: Fancy.

02:28:24.719 --> 02:28:25.959
MATT: All righty.

02:28:25.959 --> 02:28:27.482
TRAVIS: Are they dead?

02:28:29.229 --> 02:28:31.379
Are the guards lightning bolted to death?

02:28:33.219 --> 02:28:36.107
MATT: No, they are both badly hurt.

02:28:37.029 --> 02:28:38.901
Well, no, it arcs back through them, so--

02:28:38.901 --> 02:28:40.709
(laughter)

02:28:40.709 --> 02:28:43.701
TRAVIS: Oh, that's rich.
MATT: Oh yeah, they are fried.

02:28:43.701 --> 02:28:45.442
TRAVIS: (exclaims)

02:28:45.442 --> 02:28:47.669
TALIESIN: There's going to be nothing left to bury

02:28:47.669 --> 02:28:49.249
of anybody on this board.

02:28:49.249 --> 02:28:51.839
SAM: Do either of them have name tags?

02:28:51.839 --> 02:28:52.705
TALIESIN: Not anymore.
(laughter)

02:28:52.884 --> 02:28:53.717
TRAVIS: Boy.

02:28:53.717 --> 02:28:56.456
MATT: They both fall onto the ground,

02:28:56.456 --> 02:28:58.366
smoke pouring out of the armor

02:28:58.366 --> 02:29:03.126
as you can see the charred flesh and skin poking through,

02:29:03.126 --> 02:29:04.976
skeletal. The jaw's stretched,

02:29:04.976 --> 02:29:07.046
eyes milky and near popping.

02:29:07.046 --> 02:29:08.832
They're just (death rattle).
ASHLEY: Oh my.

02:29:08.832 --> 02:29:09.806
SAM: We are the baddies.

02:29:09.806 --> 02:29:10.639
MATT: Smoke--

02:29:10.639 --> 02:29:12.789
LAURA: Yeah, this is bad.
SAM: Oh god.

02:29:12.789 --> 02:29:14.026
TRAVIS: You're in the armory. Maybe find something!

02:29:14.026 --> 02:29:18.426
LIAM: These are not rent-a-cops at the yogurt store.

02:29:18.426 --> 02:29:19.634
TRAVIS: Correct.

02:29:19.634 --> 02:29:21.317
You are at the basement armory

02:29:21.317 --> 02:29:23.643
of the Cerberus Assembly institution.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:29:23.643 --> 02:29:24.476
SAM: Okay.

02:29:24.476 --> 02:29:25.309
LIAM: They do bad things here.

02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:27.276
SAM: That's it. There's still some other doors

02:29:27.276 --> 02:29:29.102
we haven't opened or explored.

02:29:30.214 --> 02:29:32.196
Caleb, why don't you search the room

02:29:32.196 --> 02:29:34.056
while I stand watch out here?

02:29:34.056 --> 02:29:36.737
LIAM: No, we're going to keep ourselves on task.

02:29:36.737 --> 02:29:37.576
LAURA: Yeah.

02:29:37.576 --> 02:29:38.636
SAM: What do you mean?

02:29:38.636 --> 02:29:39.661
LIAM: We're not checking every room;

02:29:39.661 --> 02:29:41.456
we're going to where we're going.

02:29:41.456 --> 02:29:44.686
SAM: But there's shit in there! Shiny shit!

02:29:44.686 --> 02:29:47.256
LAURA: It's just armor. It doesn't look like magic stuff.

02:29:47.256 --> 02:29:48.235
TRAVIS: Does it?

02:29:48.235 --> 02:29:49.636
LAURA: Can you Detect Magic in there?

02:29:49.636 --> 02:29:51.926
LIAM: I'm casting Detect Magic now, but I'm not really--

02:29:51.926 --> 02:29:54.296
I'll do a one second glance in there,

02:29:54.296 --> 02:29:55.916
but it's not why I'm casting Detect Magic.

02:29:55.916 --> 02:29:57.846
MATT: Okay, you cast Detect Magic.

02:29:57.846 --> 02:30:01.416
You walk inside and glance at the interior of this chamber.

02:30:01.416 --> 02:30:02.986
Nothing magical catches your eye.

02:30:02.986 --> 02:30:05.316
You do see racks and racks of weapons, armor.

02:30:05.316 --> 02:30:06.666
A lot of it's missing,

02:30:06.666 --> 02:30:08.136
but there is still a fair amount of it here.

02:30:08.136 --> 02:30:10.926
This looks to be at least one armory

02:30:10.926 --> 02:30:14.171
and storage facility for the sanatorium itself.

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:15.545
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to quickly look at

02:30:15.545 --> 02:30:17.037
both doors in this hallway.

02:30:18.144 --> 02:30:19.776
MATT: Okay.

02:30:19.776 --> 02:30:23.749
Glancing at both, nothing catches your eye as magical.

02:30:24.916 --> 02:30:27.619
LIAM: Okay, I plant my hands on Veth's shoulders.

02:30:28.776 --> 02:30:30.526
We can unpack this when we get out of here.

02:30:30.526 --> 02:30:31.481
Come check this lock, please.

02:30:31.481 --> 02:30:33.566
SAM: All right, all right, checking the lock.

02:30:33.566 --> 02:30:34.707
MATT: Which one?

02:30:34.707 --> 02:30:36.826
LIAM: The one at the end of the hall

02:30:36.826 --> 02:30:38.306
that the first guard was stationed near.

02:30:38.306 --> 02:30:39.401
MATT: All right.

02:30:39.401 --> 02:30:41.936
LAURA: While they're doing that, I'll just push the remnants

02:30:41.936 --> 02:30:44.006
of the guy that was in the doorway

02:30:44.006 --> 02:30:46.149
into the room and shut the door.

02:30:47.376 --> 02:30:48.436
MATT: Okay.

02:30:48.436 --> 02:30:51.666
SAM: I'll just do a quick Message, this time to Fjord

02:30:51.666 --> 02:30:52.974
and just say--

02:30:52.974 --> 02:30:54.491
MATT: You got four bodies here.
SAM: (tearfully) Sarsaparilla.

02:30:54.491 --> 02:30:55.324
MATT: Just so you know.

02:30:55.324 --> 02:30:56.936
There's two that are like crushed balls

02:30:56.936 --> 02:30:58.366
and two that are currently fried.

02:30:58.366 --> 02:31:00.586
LAURA: I'll go pick up the crushed ball body

02:31:00.586 --> 02:31:01.694
at the end of the hallway

02:31:01.694 --> 02:31:04.060
and move him into the room.
MATT: You katamari it over.

02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:05.651
LIAM: Oh wow.
ASHLEY: Wow.

02:31:05.651 --> 02:31:07.796
MATT: (laughs)
TRAVIS: "Katamari."

02:31:07.796 --> 02:31:08.629
MATT: Okay.

02:31:09.596 --> 02:31:11.956
Scraping and leaving a trail on the stone floor,

02:31:11.956 --> 02:31:14.766
you push one over into it.

02:31:14.766 --> 02:31:16.266
It's like building the worst snowman.

02:31:16.266 --> 02:31:17.140
SAM: Ugh!

02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:20.149
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and MARISHA:
♪ Do you want to build a snowman? ♪

02:31:20.149 --> 02:31:22.276
TALIESIN: It's takes three guards to make a snowman,

02:31:22.276 --> 02:31:23.289
just think about that.

02:31:23.289 --> 02:31:24.503
(laughter)

02:31:24.503 --> 02:31:26.699
TALIESIN: You need one more.

02:31:26.699 --> 02:31:27.925
SAM: We have three.

02:31:27.925 --> 02:31:29.066
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

02:31:29.066 --> 02:31:29.899
TRAVIS: Oh my god,

02:31:29.899 --> 02:31:32.876
the art that will come from that.

02:31:32.876 --> 02:31:35.733
"We need one more. Cymie?"

02:31:35.733 --> 02:31:37.006
LIAM: Don't worry, we'll find him.

02:31:37.006 --> 02:31:38.686
TALIESIN: See if you can find a gnome guard.

02:31:38.686 --> 02:31:39.519
MATT: All right.

02:31:39.519 --> 02:31:40.736
ASHLEY: For the head.

02:31:40.736 --> 02:31:42.319
MATT: And then you close the door.

02:31:43.416 --> 02:31:44.736
You're a bit of a mess.

02:31:44.736 --> 02:31:46.482
LAURA: I bury my shame.

02:31:46.482 --> 02:31:48.394
MATT: (laughs)

02:31:48.394 --> 02:31:49.227
All righty.

02:31:49.227 --> 02:31:50.986
SAM: Checking the door for traps.

02:31:50.986 --> 02:31:52.496
MATT: At this point your--

02:31:52.496 --> 02:31:53.976
LAURA: My duplicate only lasts for a minute.

02:31:53.976 --> 02:31:57.179
MATT: Yeah, so that'll be gone.

02:31:57.179 --> 02:31:59.069
All right. You check it for traps?

02:32:00.306 --> 02:32:01.786
SAM: A lot.

02:32:01.786 --> 02:32:03.216
Yeah, A lot.

02:32:03.216 --> 02:32:04.506
Investigation, 31.

02:32:04.506 --> 02:32:06.036
MATT: It is not trapped, but it is locked.

02:32:06.036 --> 02:32:08.346
SAM: Okay, I'll start unlocking it.

02:32:08.346 --> 02:32:09.996
MATT: Okay.

02:32:09.996 --> 02:32:12.196
SAM: A lot, 29.

02:32:14.406 --> 02:32:15.796
MATT: It unlocks.

02:32:15.796 --> 02:32:17.946
A little simple push down handle.

02:32:17.946 --> 02:32:20.495
An iron handle set under the door.

02:32:20.495 --> 02:32:21.730
SAM: There wasn't a glyph in this one, right?

02:32:21.730 --> 02:32:25.254
LAURA: No, it's in front of the stairwell leading down.

02:32:25.254 --> 02:32:26.906
SAM: I open.

02:32:26.906 --> 02:32:27.739
MATT: All right.

02:32:31.596 --> 02:32:33.426
As the door opens within,

02:32:33.426 --> 02:32:38.406
you're immediately hit with the smell of caustic chemicals,

02:32:38.406 --> 02:32:40.629
familiar in some ways, others not.

02:32:41.715 --> 02:32:43.136
Make a wisdom saving throw for me.

02:32:43.136 --> 02:32:44.636
SAM: Wisdom save.

02:32:44.636 --> 02:32:45.646
Not good at that.

02:32:45.646 --> 02:32:46.629
Natural 20.

02:32:47.896 --> 02:32:49.029
MATT: Fuck, okay.

02:32:50.616 --> 02:32:52.746
Hiding off in the far corner,

02:32:52.746 --> 02:32:55.356
you see a huddled robed figure

02:32:55.356 --> 02:32:58.516
that immediately leaps up and casts a spell at you

02:32:58.516 --> 02:32:59.607
and you feel your brain--
SAM: Oh, shit.

02:32:59.607 --> 02:33:03.496
MATT: -- suddenly it begins to wince, almost like

02:33:03.496 --> 02:33:06.566
if you could tighten the muscles of your brain,

02:33:06.566 --> 02:33:07.986
your mind is trying to protect itself.

02:33:07.986 --> 02:33:09.919
Something's trying to influence you

02:33:09.919 --> 02:33:12.693
and then you shrug it off.

02:33:12.693 --> 02:33:15.014
The individual goes, "Shit."

02:33:17.676 --> 02:33:19.986
SAM: I'll step into the room and say:

02:33:19.986 --> 02:33:23.179
Please don't attack us. I'm traveling with a murderer.

02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:26.866
(laughter)

02:33:26.866 --> 02:33:29.131
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

02:33:29.131 --> 02:33:31.736
SAM: I'm not good at them anyway.

02:33:31.736 --> 02:33:32.702
That's a one.

02:33:32.702 --> 02:33:35.376
(laughter)

02:33:35.376 --> 02:33:36.737
MATT: Everyone roll initiative again.

02:33:36.737 --> 02:33:38.446
(laughter)

02:33:38.446 --> 02:33:39.437
TRAVIS: "Please don't attack me,

02:33:39.437 --> 02:33:40.921
"I'm traveling with a murderer."

02:33:40.921 --> 02:33:42.272
(laughter)

02:33:42.272 --> 02:33:44.785
TRAVIS: (crunching) Oh god, run!

02:33:44.785 --> 02:33:46.276
(laughter)

02:33:46.276 --> 02:33:47.246
TRAVIS: Just run, please!

02:33:47.246 --> 02:33:49.686
TALIESIN: That usually works for me, I don't know.

02:33:50.586 --> 02:33:51.766
MATT: All right, and...

02:33:54.988 --> 02:33:55.821
25 to 20?

02:33:56.796 --> 02:33:57.954
20 to 15?

02:33:57.954 --> 02:33:58.787
SAM: 19.

02:34:01.216 --> 02:34:03.736
TRAVIS: I heard Veth say sarsaparilla,

02:34:03.736 --> 02:34:05.026
but it sounded like she was either

02:34:05.026 --> 02:34:06.850
about to sneeze or crying.

02:34:06.850 --> 02:34:08.539
MATT: (laughs) 15 to 10?

02:34:08.539 --> 02:34:09.844
LIAM: 11.
LAURA: 13

02:34:09.844 --> 02:34:11.906
ASHLEY: They're in a tower, it's probably dusty.

02:34:11.906 --> 02:34:14.016
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, they're in the basement.

02:34:14.016 --> 02:34:15.806
Moldy.
TALIESIN: No one's cleaned in years.

02:34:15.806 --> 02:34:17.026
MATT: Veth, you're up first, what're you doing?

02:34:17.026 --> 02:34:19.719
SAM: I'm up first. We're trying to end this guy, right?

02:34:21.386 --> 02:34:26.386
I mean, we're traveling with the crusher over here.

02:34:26.795 --> 02:34:28.573
TRAVIS: (giggles)

02:34:28.573 --> 02:34:29.545
LIAM: Wesley Crusher.

02:34:29.545 --> 02:34:30.582
(laughter)

02:34:30.582 --> 02:34:32.546
TRAVIS: Dr. Beverley Crusher.

02:34:32.546 --> 02:34:36.576
SAM: I'll do Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt as a bonus action,

02:34:36.576 --> 02:34:38.956
charge it up. oh wait, he can see me.

02:34:38.956 --> 02:34:40.546
LAURA: Yeah.

02:34:40.546 --> 02:34:42.546
SAM: No, I won't do that as a bonus action.

02:34:44.516 --> 02:34:45.541
Won't do anything.

02:34:47.016 --> 02:34:47.849
Shit.

02:34:48.696 --> 02:34:50.346
I don't got that sneak attack.

02:34:50.346 --> 02:34:51.936
I need that sneak attack.

02:34:51.936 --> 02:34:55.366
So instead I will--

02:34:55.366 --> 02:34:56.876
TRAVIS: Turn around, you bitch.

02:34:56.876 --> 02:34:58.199
SAM: Shit, I got nothing.

02:35:00.713 --> 02:35:01.596
I can't do anything.

02:35:01.596 --> 02:35:02.876
LAURA: Can you hold until we do something?

02:35:02.876 --> 02:35:05.986
SAM: Yeah, I still won't get sneak attack,

02:35:05.986 --> 02:35:07.289
which is what I need.

02:35:08.626 --> 02:35:10.636
Okay, I'll just run over to him

02:35:10.636 --> 02:35:14.646
and hit him with Shocking Grasp.

02:35:14.646 --> 02:35:15.951
MATT: Okay.

02:35:15.951 --> 02:35:16.842
So you run up.
MARISHA: Lightning's the theme.

02:35:16.842 --> 02:35:19.067
SAM: Yep.
LAURA: Just dive on him.

02:35:19.067 --> 02:35:22.676
SAM and LAURA: (yelling)
(laughter)

02:35:22.676 --> 02:35:24.609
MATT: Just full-on arms out, screaming.

02:35:24.609 --> 02:35:27.021
He's like, "Ah!"

02:35:27.021 --> 02:35:30.139
LIAM: She went, "I'm here with a murderer." (screaming)

02:35:31.006 --> 02:35:32.986
MATT: That's some horror movie shit right there.

02:35:32.986 --> 02:35:33.819
Oh my goodness.

02:35:33.819 --> 02:35:36.986
MARISHA: This is a full horror film we're enacting.

02:35:36.986 --> 02:35:38.836
MATT: So was that a spell attack to see if you hit?

02:35:38.836 --> 02:35:42.226
SAM: It is, it's touch, but I think it's a a spell attack

02:35:42.226 --> 02:35:43.936
to see if I hit?

02:35:43.936 --> 02:35:45.076
Yeah, it is, it is.

02:35:45.076 --> 02:35:46.156
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll.

02:35:46.156 --> 02:35:47.233
SAM: Ooh, not great, 13.

02:35:48.093 --> 02:35:50.834
MATT: 13? 13 misses.
MARISHA: Kyrie or whatever is like,

02:35:50.834 --> 02:35:53.225
"29, 30..."

02:35:53.225 --> 02:35:55.496
MATT: You run forward, arms out and the individual

02:35:55.496 --> 02:35:58.721
off a nearby table grabs a small cudgel

02:35:58.721 --> 02:36:02.048
and hits you on the side of the arm and diverts you

02:36:02.048 --> 02:36:03.626
and you end up grabbing nothing in the air,

02:36:03.626 --> 02:36:04.459
but you're now both engaged

02:36:04.459 --> 02:36:05.593
and it's backed into the corner.

02:36:05.593 --> 02:36:06.426
SAM: Okay, okay.

02:36:06.426 --> 02:36:08.962
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn.

02:36:08.962 --> 02:36:13.416
SAM: Yeah, with bonus action, I'll disengage

02:36:13.416 --> 02:36:15.866
and sort of use any movement to get away from him.

02:36:15.866 --> 02:36:17.666
MATT: Whereabouts you going? Back to the door?

02:36:17.666 --> 02:36:20.176
SAM: Onto that table to the other corner.

02:36:20.176 --> 02:36:21.266
MATT: Over here?
SAM: Yeah.

02:36:21.266 --> 02:36:22.356
MATT: Onto it?
SAM: Yeah, sure.

02:36:22.356 --> 02:36:23.189
MATT: Okay, sure.

02:36:23.189 --> 02:36:25.651
You leap up onto the table.

02:36:26.876 --> 02:36:29.539
Okay, Jester.

02:36:31.066 --> 02:36:32.651
LAURA: Can I get into the room?

02:36:32.651 --> 02:36:33.532
MATT: Okay, one sec.

02:36:33.532 --> 02:36:36.035
(counting) 30.

02:36:36.035 --> 02:36:37.986
You can get into the doorway.

02:36:37.986 --> 02:36:40.236
They would have half cover from your current vantage point.

02:36:40.236 --> 02:36:42.086
If that affects anything you're trying to do,

02:36:42.086 --> 02:36:44.376
but you can just barely see them in the corner

02:36:44.376 --> 02:36:46.519
holding the cudgel in hand. (grunts)

02:36:46.519 --> 02:36:47.976
Just watched Veth run past

02:36:47.976 --> 02:36:48.946
and they just glance back

02:36:48.946 --> 02:36:52.027
and see you in the doorway. What are you doing?

02:36:52.027 --> 02:36:54.039
LAURA: I'm going to cast Charm Person.

02:36:54.039 --> 02:36:55.909
MATT: You cast Charm Person, okay.

02:36:56.766 --> 02:36:58.406
SAM: That doesn't undo--?

02:36:58.406 --> 02:36:59.753
LAURA: No, because it's not a concentration.

02:36:59.753 --> 02:37:00.934
Charm Person isn't concentration.

02:37:00.934 --> 02:37:01.767
SAM: Really?

02:37:02.666 --> 02:37:03.766
TALIESIN: There's a whole bunch of things--

02:37:03.766 --> 02:37:05.736
MATT: Does have advantage because you're fighting it.

02:37:05.736 --> 02:37:08.304
TALIESIN: Pure social magic.

02:37:08.304 --> 02:37:09.137
SAM: Very cool.

02:37:10.085 --> 02:37:11.959
ASHLEY: That's very cool.

02:37:11.959 --> 02:37:13.510
MATT: A seven and natural 20.

02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:15.276
SAM: (sighs)

02:37:15.276 --> 02:37:17.486
MATT: So as it looks over at you,

02:37:17.486 --> 02:37:21.206
you extend the power invested through you

02:37:21.206 --> 02:37:22.836
by the Traveler and you watch

02:37:22.836 --> 02:37:25.036
as they blink and (grunts).

02:37:25.036 --> 02:37:26.127
"Not today!"

02:37:28.096 --> 02:37:29.556
LAURA: Can I duck back around?

02:37:29.556 --> 02:37:30.636
MATT: Nope, that's all your movement.

02:37:30.636 --> 02:37:32.086
LAURA: Damn it.

02:37:32.086 --> 02:37:33.246
I'm going to lean.

02:37:34.566 --> 02:37:35.716
MATT: It is their turn now.

02:37:37.676 --> 02:37:40.686
And seeing you there glancing off to the side

02:37:40.686 --> 02:37:42.556
and trying to affect its mind,

02:37:42.556 --> 02:37:44.886
you weren't too much of a worry.

02:37:44.886 --> 02:37:46.216
Mind magic it is not happy with.

02:37:46.216 --> 02:37:47.506
It's going to go ahead and cast Fireball

02:37:47.506 --> 02:37:48.999
in that doorway over there.

02:37:49.976 --> 02:37:52.116
You watch this single red little seed

02:37:52.116 --> 02:37:55.656
goes just past the door and then detonates

02:37:55.656 --> 02:37:57.706
in the middle of the hallway right there.

02:37:58.976 --> 02:38:02.176
TRAVIS: You don't even know if your mate is alive or not.

02:38:02.176 --> 02:38:04.186
MATT: I would like both Caleb and Jester

02:38:04.186 --> 02:38:06.186
to make dexterity saving throws, please.

02:38:07.486 --> 02:38:09.379
MATT: You guys got Fireballed indoors.

02:38:11.156 --> 02:38:11.989
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:38:13.206 --> 02:38:14.256
LAURA: 21.

02:38:14.256 --> 02:38:15.706
MATT: 21, okay.

02:38:15.706 --> 02:38:17.326
LIAM: Does 13 make it?
MATT: Nope.

02:38:17.326 --> 02:38:18.436
LIAM: Then I'll trigger the ring again.

02:38:18.436 --> 02:38:19.269
MATT: Okay.

02:38:20.523 --> 02:38:22.573
MARISHA: That's why you don't fight in a basement.

02:38:25.481 --> 02:38:26.431
TRAVIS: Trigger the ring.

02:38:27.906 --> 02:38:29.672
TALIESIN: He looks way too happy.

02:38:29.672 --> 02:38:30.505
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:32.761
TALIESIN: Here comes another one.

02:38:33.636 --> 02:38:34.956
MATT: Not great rolls.

02:38:34.956 --> 02:38:37.066
22 points of fire damage, but you both succeeded,

02:38:37.066 --> 02:38:39.375
so 11 points of fire damage to each of you.

02:38:39.375 --> 02:38:40.525
SAM: Well, that's not bad.

02:38:42.986 --> 02:38:47.396
MATT: And they're going to rush

02:38:47.396 --> 02:38:50.376
and duck behind this wall

02:38:50.376 --> 02:38:52.846
and face towards you.

02:38:52.846 --> 02:38:55.436
Shifting up, putting their back against it

02:38:55.436 --> 02:38:57.126
and giving that big breath of like,

02:38:57.126 --> 02:39:00.186
"All right, you're currently the issue."

02:39:00.186 --> 02:39:03.346
That finishes their go. Caleb, you're up.

02:39:03.346 --> 02:39:05.486
LIAM: I saw that, I saw it come flying out at me

02:39:05.486 --> 02:39:07.466
and I just whip the staff back up again

02:39:07.466 --> 02:39:08.886
and pull fire out of it,

02:39:08.886 --> 02:39:11.676
and chuck a Fireball into the absolute corner

02:39:11.676 --> 02:39:12.859
of that chamber.

02:39:14.346 --> 02:39:16.873
Straight over, if I need to move forward I will.

02:39:16.873 --> 02:39:18.371
MATT: That'll give you enough of a vantage point

02:39:18.371 --> 02:39:19.279
to launch it in.

02:39:19.279 --> 02:39:20.346
LIAM: Dead center of the corner

02:39:20.346 --> 02:39:22.356
to hopefully not hit Veth.

02:39:22.356 --> 02:39:23.506
MATT: Right there?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:39:24.556 --> 02:39:28.906
MATT: I'll say per that dead corner in there,

02:39:28.906 --> 02:39:31.176
it still just barely overlaps her.

02:39:31.176 --> 02:39:32.934
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: So if I have Veth

02:39:32.934 --> 02:39:34.946
to make a dexterity check.

02:39:34.946 --> 02:39:36.546
A dexterity saving throw, sorry.

02:39:37.636 --> 02:39:38.936
SAM: 19.

02:39:38.936 --> 02:39:41.786
MATT: 19 I believe is a success, if it was 18.

02:39:41.786 --> 02:39:42.886
So you take

02:39:45.261 --> 02:39:48.266
no damage because of Evasion, right?

02:39:48.266 --> 02:39:49.566
SAM: Is that how it works?

02:39:49.566 --> 02:39:50.446
MATT: If you succeed at what

02:39:50.446 --> 02:39:51.886
would normally be half damage you take none

02:39:51.886 --> 02:39:54.066
and then if you fail-- so you take none.

02:39:54.066 --> 02:39:55.156
This individual failed.

02:39:55.156 --> 02:39:56.659
So full damage on this.

02:39:58.494 --> 02:40:00.483
TRAVIS: You do the dope under the desk dive.

02:40:00.483 --> 02:40:01.702
SAM: Yeah, yeah, of course.

02:40:01.702 --> 02:40:03.427
TALIESIN: This is the best heist ever.
SAM: Just like in Backdraft.

02:40:03.427 --> 02:40:05.093
LIAM: 40.
MATT: 40?

02:40:05.093 --> 02:40:06.732
TRAVIS: How much?
TALIESIN: This is how a heist should be,

02:40:06.732 --> 02:40:08.356
which is just going room to room.

02:40:08.356 --> 02:40:10.846
MARISHA: Crushing people.
TALIESIN: Crunching and just cutting a swathe.

02:40:10.846 --> 02:40:12.629
TRAVIS: Four-zero Fireball damage?

02:40:13.466 --> 02:40:16.916
MATT: So at once-- the first Fireball

02:40:18.096 --> 02:40:19.606
rocks the interior a bit,

02:40:19.606 --> 02:40:21.616
flames begin to catch on the very edge

02:40:21.616 --> 02:40:23.736
of some of the wooden elements

02:40:23.736 --> 02:40:25.386
of that contraption on the side

02:40:25.386 --> 02:40:26.916
where you see a bunch of the liquid is being kept.

02:40:26.916 --> 02:40:29.716
Some of the glass cracks a little bit.

02:40:29.716 --> 02:40:34.116
The other Fireball hits the other side beneath.

02:40:34.116 --> 02:40:36.556
As that one hits, you can see this table and this table

02:40:36.556 --> 02:40:40.096
are now on fire, the edges are starting to catch.

02:40:40.096 --> 02:40:41.616
Veth, you manage to just duck out of the way.

02:40:41.616 --> 02:40:43.986
The figure is facing you tries to blast out of the way

02:40:43.986 --> 02:40:45.077
and gets caught on the edge of it

02:40:45.077 --> 02:40:47.176
and as it pulls back, you can see they're burned black

02:40:47.176 --> 02:40:48.496
on one side of their face.

02:40:48.496 --> 02:40:50.696
Part of their robes are now charred and curled up

02:40:50.696 --> 02:40:51.659
and starting to smoke.

02:40:51.659 --> 02:40:54.536
They're like, (grunts, panting).

02:40:54.536 --> 02:40:55.776
That finishes Caleb's go,

02:40:55.776 --> 02:40:57.136
Top of the round, Veth, you're up.

02:40:57.136 --> 02:40:59.356
TRAVIS: I know it's underground and there's stone

02:40:59.356 --> 02:41:01.796
and earth and stuff, but do we hear a--

02:41:01.796 --> 02:41:02.629
MATT: Oh, we'll get to that.

02:41:02.629 --> 02:41:03.462
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:41:05.216 --> 02:41:07.249
SAM: I told you not to attack us!

02:41:07.249 --> 02:41:10.076
Now I'll cast Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt

02:41:10.076 --> 02:41:12.426
and I'll just shoot him point-blank.

02:41:12.426 --> 02:41:13.259
MATT: Okay.

02:41:15.046 --> 02:41:16.781
SAM: It hits, its 27 to hit it.

02:41:16.781 --> 02:41:18.256
MATT: That hits, yeah.

02:41:18.256 --> 02:41:20.806
SAM: No sneak attack, but

02:41:20.806 --> 02:41:23.797
that's nine points of damage, plus

02:41:25.564 --> 02:41:27.954
another 10,

02:41:27.954 --> 02:41:29.716
19 points of damage.

02:41:29.716 --> 02:41:30.549
MATT: That'll do it.

02:41:32.056 --> 02:41:34.646
As you lock it up, prepare,

02:41:34.646 --> 02:41:36.776
and you watch the energy arc up into the bolt

02:41:36.776 --> 02:41:38.786
and you fire it, the person goes (grunts)

02:41:38.786 --> 02:41:39.896
and raises their hand like they're ready

02:41:39.896 --> 02:41:42.556
to cast a spell in retribution as you fire it.

02:41:42.556 --> 02:41:45.243
It sinks into the arm and they like, "Ah!"

02:41:46.186 --> 02:41:49.366
As they look down, it just severed past the vein.

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.646
(groaning)

02:41:51.646 --> 02:41:53.816
MATT: And they look down and the bolt went through

02:41:53.816 --> 02:41:55.586
and then went right into their chest.

02:41:55.586 --> 02:41:58.318
It had just enough force to go through and then bursts.

02:41:58.318 --> 02:41:59.916
They look at you and the energy

02:41:59.916 --> 02:42:02.046
crackles up through their eyes

02:42:02.046 --> 02:42:05.062
and they fall to the ground down the stairs. (thumping)

02:42:05.062 --> 02:42:05.937
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:42:05.937 --> 02:42:07.026
MARISHA: Down the stairs?

02:42:07.026 --> 02:42:08.016
MATT: Because they were standing right in front

02:42:08.016 --> 02:42:08.869
of the stairs that led into the lower floor.

02:42:08.869 --> 02:42:10.286
SAM: There's more rooms that we have to get through?

02:42:10.286 --> 02:42:12.176
ASHLEY: You got to get downstairs.
LIAM: Did they trigger?

02:42:12.176 --> 02:42:13.186
I know there's a sigil there.

02:42:13.186 --> 02:42:15.876
SAM: I don't want to kill any more people!
LIAM: Did anything happen from the sigil?

02:42:15.876 --> 02:42:18.756
MATT: Yes, actually. (laughs)

02:42:18.756 --> 02:42:20.649
As the body falls and hits the floor,

02:42:21.866 --> 02:42:23.616
the sigil glows in the ground

02:42:23.616 --> 02:42:27.426
and then this electrical energy just spins around the room

02:42:27.426 --> 02:42:29.156
in this entire space.

02:42:29.156 --> 02:42:31.356
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

02:42:32.998 --> 02:42:35.049
SAM: 17.
MATT: 17 does not succeed.

02:42:36.306 --> 02:42:38.256
LIAM: And it's Evasion only once per round, right?

02:42:38.256 --> 02:42:39.089
As a reaction?

02:42:39.089 --> 02:42:39.922
LAURA: Yeah.

02:42:42.006 --> 02:42:43.116
MATT: Well, you've had your turn since,

02:42:43.116 --> 02:42:44.496
so you still get Evasion on this.

02:42:44.496 --> 02:42:46.374
SAM: But Evasion also isn't a--

02:42:46.374 --> 02:42:47.499
MATT: I think it's just any time.

02:42:48.906 --> 02:42:49.739
SAM: It's just a thing.

02:42:49.739 --> 02:42:53.026
Uncanny Dodge is a reaction, which I will use right now.

02:42:53.026 --> 02:42:54.616
But it's an area of effect, so it doesn't help.

02:42:54.616 --> 02:42:55.596
MATT: Correct.

02:42:55.596 --> 02:42:56.749
LIAM: That's a sword swing.

02:42:57.706 --> 02:43:00.256
MATT: Oh, there we go. That's the damage.

02:43:00.256 --> 02:43:01.596
TALIESIN: Oh, there we go.

02:43:01.596 --> 02:43:02.696
LAURA: That's not good.

02:43:04.681 --> 02:43:05.514
MARISHA: Oh no.

02:43:05.514 --> 02:43:07.066
TALIESIN: This is why you bring a cleric.

02:43:10.946 --> 02:43:13.666
MATT: 47 points of lightning damage, reduced to half

02:43:13.666 --> 02:43:16.866
because of your Evasion ability.

02:43:16.866 --> 02:43:18.702
LAURA: Oh yeah, and resistance to lightning.

02:43:18.702 --> 02:43:19.535
MATT: And resistance to lightning.

02:43:19.535 --> 02:43:21.820
So that would be a quarter of that.

02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:22.986
TRAVIS: 12.
MATT: 12, there you go.

02:43:22.986 --> 02:43:24.736
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: Whoa.

02:43:24.736 --> 02:43:26.896
LIAM: Caleb's just going to stalk further in

02:43:26.896 --> 02:43:28.366
and I'm going to start to use Control Flame

02:43:28.366 --> 02:43:32.466
to put out any fires, as a cantrip, that are left in here.

02:43:32.466 --> 02:43:33.849
To stop the whole room from exploding.

02:43:33.849 --> 02:43:35.490
LAURA: I'm going to put my head in my hands.
MATT: Good you do that,

02:43:35.490 --> 02:43:37.346
because things are starting to ignite

02:43:37.346 --> 02:43:39.136
and there are a whole bunch of containers

02:43:39.136 --> 02:43:40.477
with all sorts of errant chemicals

02:43:40.477 --> 02:43:41.602
that you do not know about.

02:43:41.602 --> 02:43:43.276
TRAVIS: Smoke is bad.
MATT: Yeah.

02:43:43.276 --> 02:43:44.206
There is smoke in the room,

02:43:44.206 --> 02:43:46.186
but with your Control Fire

02:43:46.186 --> 02:43:47.656
you can take a moment to control it

02:43:47.656 --> 02:43:50.018
before it begins to fill the entirety of this basement.

02:43:50.018 --> 02:43:52.518
SAM: I will send a quick Message, this time to Yasha.

02:43:53.609 --> 02:43:56.436
So we called ourselves Team Fire Storm.

02:43:56.436 --> 02:43:59.119
(laughter)

02:43:59.119 --> 02:44:00.676
SAM: Um.

02:44:00.676 --> 02:44:03.096
We've caused a firestorm.

02:44:03.096 --> 02:44:04.986
Things aren't great.

02:44:04.986 --> 02:44:07.644
Be ready to come down here--
LAURA: No!

02:44:07.644 --> 02:44:09.820
SAM: -- soon, when asked.

02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:13.399
LAURA: No, no, don't bring them down into this.

02:44:14.686 --> 02:44:15.796
If we need to, we've only got

02:44:15.796 --> 02:44:17.526
one more room we need to get to.
LIAM: We're very close.

02:44:17.526 --> 02:44:20.386
LAURA: Yeah, so just tell them to prepare to bamf out.

02:44:20.386 --> 02:44:21.743
Tell Caduceus to be prepared.

02:44:21.743 --> 02:44:23.106
SAM: Ignore that, we're doing fine.

02:44:23.106 --> 02:44:25.747
Just be ready to bamf us out of here.

02:44:25.747 --> 02:44:27.964
ASHLEY: O-kay.

02:44:27.964 --> 02:44:29.728
MATT: Beauregard, what are you doing?

02:44:29.728 --> 02:44:31.755
MARISHA: Is he still sleeping?

02:44:31.755 --> 02:44:34.126
MATT: As you're standing there,

02:44:34.126 --> 02:44:35.516
you feel this very very faint,

02:44:35.516 --> 02:44:37.199
with your high perception.

02:44:37.199 --> 02:44:38.407
(rumbling)

02:44:38.407 --> 02:44:41.136
Just this low, sub-base rumble

02:44:41.136 --> 02:44:45.136
and you feel the stone just ever so faintly shift.

02:44:45.136 --> 02:44:48.604
The guy in front of you goes, (faint snoring)

02:44:48.604 --> 02:44:52.646
and it sounds like he's stirring.

02:44:52.646 --> 02:44:54.216
MARISHA: Can I hear any clanks of armor

02:44:54.216 --> 02:44:55.986
from the guards that were patrolling out front?

02:44:55.986 --> 02:44:57.286
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:44:58.573 --> 02:44:59.846
MARISHA: Oh, come on.

02:44:59.846 --> 02:45:03.526
Perception's not my-- that's cocked-- not my strong suit.

02:45:03.526 --> 02:45:06.006
It's not my strong suit, 15 total.

02:45:06.006 --> 02:45:06.839
MATT: 15.

02:45:08.006 --> 02:45:12.036
You do not hear any sort of metallic clanks at the moment.

02:45:12.036 --> 02:45:13.566
MARISHA: The guy in front of me is stirring?

02:45:13.566 --> 02:45:14.399
MATT: He is stirring.

02:45:16.306 --> 02:45:18.199
MARISHA: He's an open-mouth snorer?

02:45:18.199 --> 02:45:20.446
(laughter)

02:45:20.446 --> 02:45:22.316
MATT: You assume by the sound, probably,

02:45:22.316 --> 02:45:23.561
though facing away from you.

02:45:23.561 --> 02:45:25.716
LIAM: (open-mouthed snoring)

02:45:25.716 --> 02:45:28.129
MARISHA: I've been prepping my acid vial.

02:45:28.129 --> 02:45:30.136
TRAVIS: You have, you sick fuck.

02:45:30.136 --> 02:45:32.686
MARISHA: I'm going to palm both of them, they're both open

02:45:33.616 --> 02:45:35.066
and just get in front of him

02:45:36.476 --> 02:45:39.106
and then in one fell swoop,

02:45:39.106 --> 02:45:41.016
grab his nose, CPR grab

02:45:41.016 --> 02:45:44.073
and dump the acid vials into his head.

02:45:44.073 --> 02:45:46.477
And then do the get him down.

02:45:46.477 --> 02:45:49.036
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

02:45:49.036 --> 02:45:52.336
Because right now you are going to behind grapple.

02:45:52.336 --> 02:45:53.986
He is waking up.

02:45:53.986 --> 02:45:54.819
MARISHA: 27.

02:45:55.798 --> 02:45:57.356
MATT: But you do catch him a little off-guard.

02:45:57.356 --> 02:45:59.196
MARISHA: Yeah, he's still, yeah.

02:45:59.196 --> 02:46:00.246
MATT: I'll say advantage on this

02:46:00.246 --> 02:46:01.586
just because he's not aware that you're there.

02:46:01.586 --> 02:46:02.419
MARISHA: Great.

02:46:04.286 --> 02:46:06.576
Oh, that's even better, 29 total.

02:46:06.576 --> 02:46:09.876
I rolled a 19 plus 10.

02:46:09.876 --> 02:46:11.216
MATT: Yeah, that'll do it.

02:46:11.216 --> 02:46:14.036
So as you reach behind, you grab the nose, pull him back.

02:46:14.036 --> 02:46:15.726
Right as you put it into his mouth,

02:46:15.726 --> 02:46:17.236
I'm going to give him one opportunity

02:46:17.236 --> 02:46:19.524
to try and fight out of this

02:46:19.524 --> 02:46:22.336
because it's not a thing you do so swiftly,

02:46:22.336 --> 02:46:23.456
there's a lot of resistance to it.

02:46:23.456 --> 02:46:25.196
You have him grappled now.

02:46:25.196 --> 02:46:27.546
You're now trying to place the acid.

02:46:27.546 --> 02:46:28.786
MARISHA: All of it in his mouth.

02:46:28.786 --> 02:46:29.949
MATT: Yes, I know, I know.

02:46:31.446 --> 02:46:32.446
Natural seven, nope.

02:46:34.148 --> 02:46:35.876
TALIESIN: That's the most Marisha thing you've done.

02:46:35.876 --> 02:46:39.101
As you hold him, you hear (guttural choking).

02:46:43.306 --> 02:46:46.306
MARISHA: I roll my body on top of his face

02:46:46.306 --> 02:46:48.366
to try and stifle the noise.

02:46:48.366 --> 02:46:49.306
MATT: Okay.

02:46:49.306 --> 02:46:50.139
Just so you're aware.

02:46:50.139 --> 02:46:51.771
TRAVIS: You're going to get the acid all over your chest.

02:46:51.771 --> 02:46:54.996
MARISHA: It's okay, I can take a little acid.

02:46:54.996 --> 02:46:57.339
MATT: So you're pulling him onto the ground?

02:46:58.336 --> 02:46:59.386
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:46:59.386 --> 02:47:02.086
Trying to roll him, I'm doing the roll, yeah.

02:47:02.086 --> 02:47:04.776
MATT: Okay, so we'll say you get a little bit

02:47:04.776 --> 02:47:06.266
of acid on your hands.

02:47:06.266 --> 02:47:08.186
You take three points of acid damage.

02:47:08.186 --> 02:47:09.019
MARISHA: Okay.

02:47:10.206 --> 02:47:11.756
MATT: But you're holding him there.

02:47:12.949 --> 02:47:13.782
TRAVIS: Full mouth.

02:47:18.386 --> 02:47:21.056
MATT: He keeps trying to escape and he's just,

02:47:21.056 --> 02:47:22.611
it takes a while, that's the worst part.

02:47:22.611 --> 02:47:25.944
(groaning and laughing)

02:47:29.264 --> 02:47:32.070
This is the harshest, "Go to sleep,

02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:33.436
"go to sleep, go to sleep."

02:47:34.866 --> 02:47:35.996
MARISHA: And I'm just trying to keep him

02:47:35.996 --> 02:47:37.708
as fucking quiet as possible.

02:47:37.708 --> 02:47:39.383
TRAVIS: We're the bad guys.

02:47:39.383 --> 02:47:41.308
MARISHA: We're the baddies.
TRAVIS: Dude.

02:47:41.308 --> 02:47:43.176
MATT: While the rest of you are looking around the chamber,

02:47:43.176 --> 02:47:45.756
you do notice amongst the chemicals,

02:47:45.756 --> 02:47:50.756
there is a rack, which is a table long torture device.

02:47:51.846 --> 02:47:55.326
There are a number of implements across the tables

02:47:55.326 --> 02:47:56.476
that are used for incisions,

02:47:56.476 --> 02:47:58.176
that are used for carving of flesh.

02:47:58.176 --> 02:47:59.899
LAURA: These are the bad guys.

02:48:00.786 --> 02:48:02.386
MATT: I didn't know you were going to come in this hard,

02:48:02.386 --> 02:48:04.646
but to alleviate you a little bit,

02:48:04.646 --> 02:48:06.426
these aren't all the best people.

02:48:06.426 --> 02:48:07.422
LIAM: Yeah, dude.

02:48:07.422 --> 02:48:10.516
The guy out front just dopey from your Jester love.

02:48:10.516 --> 02:48:12.826
MATT: Mind you, you don't know how much they know

02:48:12.826 --> 02:48:14.411
or engaged in any of this.

02:48:14.411 --> 02:48:15.769
MARISHA: Right, they could be making minimum wage.

02:48:15.769 --> 02:48:17.460
TALIESIN: Some people just need to pay the bills.

02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:18.816
MARISHA: Exactly.
MATT: Exactly.

02:48:18.816 --> 02:48:20.796
LIAM: Do you think they walked past all these tongs

02:48:20.796 --> 02:48:22.738
and needles and incision making things

02:48:22.738 --> 02:48:25.216
and were like, "Oh, it's a macrame class."

02:48:25.216 --> 02:48:26.966
LAURA: They are complicit.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:48:26.966 --> 02:48:28.500
MARISHA: You're not wrong.
MATT: Sure.

02:48:29.686 --> 02:48:30.583
But anyway.

02:48:30.583 --> 02:48:35.450
TRAVIS: (guttural groaning)

02:48:37.184 --> 02:48:40.524
MATT: Guys, this may be one of the most

02:48:40.524 --> 02:48:44.453
grotesque kills I've had at the table.

02:48:44.453 --> 02:48:45.477
TALIESIN: It's up there.

02:48:45.477 --> 02:48:47.016
MATT: It's definitely on the list.

02:48:47.016 --> 02:48:49.087
Well done. Well done.

02:48:50.956 --> 02:48:52.281
MARISHA: You just crunched a bunch of people.

02:48:52.281 --> 02:48:53.538
LIAM: Don't be a one-upper, Marisha.

02:48:53.538 --> 02:48:55.156
(laughter)

02:48:55.156 --> 02:48:59.186
MATT: The good thing is, the crunch was pretty quick.

02:48:59.186 --> 02:49:01.152
This is going to take a few minutes.

02:49:01.152 --> 02:49:02.476
LIAM: Minutes?!

02:49:02.476 --> 02:49:03.309
MATT: Yeah!

02:49:04.276 --> 02:49:07.752
MATT: Acid doesn't dissolve that
quickly when it comes to flesh.

02:49:07.752 --> 02:49:09.876
LAURA: If she noticed that he was dying slowly,

02:49:09.876 --> 02:49:10.806
she could kill him quick.

02:49:10.806 --> 02:49:12.741
LIAM: You can just push him off, too.

02:49:12.741 --> 02:49:14.126
MARISHA: I don't push him off.

02:49:14.126 --> 02:49:15.755
TRAVIS: Give him a little
TALIEISN: -- little snap.

02:49:15.755 --> 02:49:17.743
MARISHA: I could give him a snap
to put him out of his misery.

02:49:17.743 --> 02:49:18.976
MATT: Sure, there you go.

02:49:20.126 --> 02:49:21.994
Easy enough to do at this point.
MARISHA: Once it felt like 60 seconds

02:49:21.994 --> 02:49:24.386
and he's still like-- then--
SAM: Did the head fall off

02:49:24.386 --> 02:49:27.486
because it was so weakened from all the acid?

02:49:27.486 --> 02:49:29.686
MATT: Not yet, not yet, not yet.

02:49:29.686 --> 02:49:32.506
Okay, that was horrifying.

02:49:32.506 --> 02:49:33.339
Okay.

02:49:34.528 --> 02:49:36.922
TRAVIS: (guttural groaning)

02:49:36.922 --> 02:49:38.286
MATT: All right, he'd dead.

02:49:38.286 --> 02:49:40.876
You place it there and you look up over the edge

02:49:40.876 --> 02:49:44.016
as you see one guard rushing away from the tower

02:49:44.016 --> 02:49:46.326
towards the center of the grounds.

02:49:46.326 --> 02:49:47.286
Away from this tower?

02:49:47.286 --> 02:49:48.119
MATT: Correct.

02:49:48.119 --> 02:49:49.966
MARISHA: Alerting people? Clearly.

02:49:49.966 --> 02:49:51.286
It feels like he's alerting people.

02:49:51.286 --> 02:49:53.276
TRAVIS: Either that or on an afternoon jog.

02:49:53.276 --> 02:49:54.109
MATT: Either that.

02:49:56.146 --> 02:49:58.636
LAURA: Maybe he thinks there's an earthquake.

02:49:58.636 --> 02:50:02.896
MARISHA: I crawl over-- he probably does-- over to the edge

02:50:02.896 --> 02:50:06.086
and I try to signal Fjord and Team Outtie.

02:50:06.086 --> 02:50:07.265
MATT: With?

02:50:07.265 --> 02:50:09.086
LIAM: Baseball signals.
MARISHA: Baseball signals

02:50:09.086 --> 02:50:09.986
and just say like--

02:50:15.423 --> 02:50:16.256
SAM: What does that mean?

02:50:16.256 --> 02:50:17.666
TALIESIN: I'm just repeating it.

02:50:17.666 --> 02:50:19.926
ASHLEY: I'm just busy making a daisy chain

02:50:19.926 --> 02:50:20.808
while I've been waiting.

02:50:20.808 --> 02:50:22.416
(laughter)

02:50:22.416 --> 02:50:25.659
LIAM: Beau's going to love this.
ASHLEY: I think something's wrong.

02:50:25.659 --> 02:50:27.806
TALIESIN: Do I see any of this shit going down?

02:50:27.806 --> 02:50:28.906
MARISHA: I'm just going to...

02:50:30.236 --> 02:50:32.826
MATT: You saw a brief scuffle and then her coming back

02:50:32.826 --> 02:50:34.616
and just making these hand signals.

02:50:34.616 --> 02:50:39.616
MARISHA: Directing the guards and I do the Fjord. (sirens)

02:50:41.463 --> 02:50:42.296
Alarms!

02:50:42.296 --> 02:50:44.581
TRAVIS: It's the sound of the police! Woop, woop.

02:50:44.581 --> 02:50:48.297
(laughter)

02:50:48.297 --> 02:50:49.135
Yeah.

02:50:49.135 --> 02:50:53.526
(laughter)

02:50:54.456 --> 02:50:56.277
That's all they heard.

02:50:56.277 --> 02:50:58.723
(laughter)

02:50:58.723 --> 02:51:01.146
MATT: There aren't alarms in Exandria like that.

02:51:01.146 --> 02:51:03.301
I love it. I love it.

02:51:03.301 --> 02:51:04.856
TRAVIS: Because she does do this and points,

02:51:04.856 --> 02:51:06.736
I'll look in the direction.

02:51:06.736 --> 02:51:09.570
Do I see anybody?
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:51:09.570 --> 02:51:10.503
Sure, sure.
ASHLEY: Yeah, could I-- yeah.

02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:13.356
TRAVIS: 16.

02:51:14.806 --> 02:51:15.639
TALIESIN: 13.

02:51:16.756 --> 02:51:18.331
ASHLEY: One.

02:51:18.331 --> 02:51:20.794
I don't know why I didn't really...

02:51:20.794 --> 02:51:21.696
This is going to be so nice.

02:51:21.696 --> 02:51:24.376
MATT: You barely see, out of the edge.

02:51:24.376 --> 02:51:27.346
You see one figure who's in a brisk jog

02:51:27.346 --> 02:51:29.686
away from this structure heading deeper

02:51:29.686 --> 02:51:34.686
into the center of the sanatorium's

02:51:34.702 --> 02:51:36.268
estate grounds.

02:51:38.636 --> 02:51:42.996
They're about 115 feet from you right now.

02:51:42.996 --> 02:51:44.706
TRAVIS: It's too far for anything.

02:51:44.706 --> 02:51:46.306
Except an annoying shot in the back

02:51:46.306 --> 02:51:48.276
that would only make it worse.

02:51:48.276 --> 02:51:50.036
I think the jig is up.

02:51:50.036 --> 02:51:52.536
We should probably prepare to get them out of here.

02:51:52.536 --> 02:51:57.536
ASHLEY: Okay, do we stay here?

02:51:57.836 --> 02:51:59.186
TRAVIS: Yeah, we stay right here.

02:52:01.646 --> 02:52:05.276
TALIESIN: We wait 'til they tell us
that they're teleporting out

02:52:06.186 --> 02:52:09.556
or until they tell us to distract or attack.

02:52:09.556 --> 02:52:12.306
We can let them know it seems like they've been made.

02:52:13.956 --> 02:52:16.191
ASHLEY: I'll tell Veth.

02:52:16.191 --> 02:52:20.516
Veth, it looks like you have been made.

02:52:21.776 --> 02:52:24.126
So you need get out as soon as you can.

02:52:24.126 --> 02:52:26.709
Get the supplies and leave.

02:52:27.986 --> 02:52:29.686
TRAVIS: The thing we can be ready to do

02:52:29.686 --> 02:52:31.046
is if we see reinforcements

02:52:31.046 --> 02:52:32.796
heading towards the tower or the entrance,

02:52:32.796 --> 02:52:36.636
we need to make a distraction elsewhere, right?

02:52:36.636 --> 02:52:38.386
I can do Major Image or something,

02:52:38.386 --> 02:52:40.246
but we should be prepared to draw attention

02:52:40.246 --> 02:52:41.086
away from where they are.

02:52:41.086 --> 02:52:41.919
TALIESIN: I'll put an earthquake.

02:52:41.919 --> 02:52:44.176
I can throw an earthquake like 60 feet away.

02:52:44.176 --> 02:52:46.673
TRAVIS: They're underground,
so I don't know about the earthquake.

02:52:46.673 --> 02:52:51.646
(laughter)

02:52:51.646 --> 02:52:52.849
MATT: Hey guys, we got them.

02:52:54.634 --> 02:52:56.217
ASHLEY: What's happening?

02:52:57.149 --> 02:53:00.428
TRAVIS: We just hear a (yells).

02:53:00.428 --> 02:53:01.872
No, that could help.

02:53:01.872 --> 02:53:03.564
LIAM: Suddenly we're in Cloverfield.

02:53:05.176 --> 02:53:06.726
MATT: The whole basement collapses.

02:53:08.126 --> 02:53:09.087
LIAM: Yeah, one more room.

02:53:09.087 --> 02:53:13.038
MATT: Yasha's like, "Veth, we have to go."

02:53:13.038 --> 02:53:16.176
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll start to actually shift from that--

02:53:16.176 --> 02:53:17.902
No, fuck it, I'll stay in the corner, okay.

02:53:17.902 --> 02:53:19.236
MATT: All right, so you're all staying
in the corner right now,

02:53:19.236 --> 02:53:20.228
keeping an eye?

02:53:20.228 --> 02:53:21.061
ASHLEY: Yep.
MATT: Got it.

02:53:21.061 --> 02:53:24.386
ASHLEY: They know now, we're good.

02:53:24.386 --> 02:53:26.486
MARISHA: I'm just watching for the guards

02:53:26.486 --> 02:53:29.206
and trying to stay low and watch them run around.

02:53:29.206 --> 02:53:30.223
TALIESIN: You're keeping an eye, okay.

02:53:30.223 --> 02:53:31.056
MARISHA: Keeping an eye, yeah.

02:53:31.056 --> 02:53:31.956
MATT: The rest of you.

02:53:32.926 --> 02:53:33.759
SAM: Let's go down.

02:53:33.759 --> 02:53:35.866
LIAM: Stay on task, Widogast, here we go.

02:53:35.866 --> 02:53:39.291
SAM: You first or me first? Ine-you or me-ine?

02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:42.696
MATT: Do you still have Detect Magic on?

02:53:42.696 --> 02:53:44.142
The glyph is still glowing, by the way.

02:53:44.142 --> 02:53:45.228
LIAM: The glyph is still...

02:53:45.228 --> 02:53:46.416
Oh, it's still going?

02:53:46.416 --> 02:53:47.286
MATT: It's still glowing.

02:53:47.286 --> 02:53:49.686
LIAM: Glow, well that's, yeah. Same deal, same deal.

02:53:52.186 --> 02:53:56.706
Dispel at 5th.

02:53:56.706 --> 02:53:57.539
SAM Ooh.

02:53:59.173 --> 02:54:01.245
LAURA: Nice.
MATT: The glyph scatters.

02:54:01.245 --> 02:54:02.835
SAM: I'll go down.

02:54:02.835 --> 02:54:04.238
Is there a door?

02:54:05.875 --> 02:54:06.708
MATT: Where you are right now,

02:54:06.708 --> 02:54:10.955
it descends into a very, very comparable amount

02:54:10.955 --> 02:54:12.810
of low torchlight,

02:54:13.645 --> 02:54:15.577
and you can see an end to the floor.

02:54:15.577 --> 02:54:16.668
So there is no door.

02:54:17.575 --> 02:54:19.355
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:54:19.355 --> 02:54:22.865
I'll peek in, seeing if I can see anything.

02:54:22.865 --> 02:54:25.375
MATT: Let me go ahead and switch this out if you don't mind.

02:54:25.375 --> 02:54:26.515
SAM: Ooh boy, guys.

02:54:26.515 --> 02:54:28.025
Multiple maps!

02:54:28.025 --> 02:54:29.445
LIAM: Uff da.

02:54:29.445 --> 02:54:32.605
SAM: Multiple Dwarven Forge maps!
TALIESIN: You gotta get back to us ASAP, right?

02:54:32.605 --> 02:54:34.438
SAM: bit.ly/critroledf.

02:54:34.438 --> 02:54:35.937
TRAVIS: We still have a fence for you to get through.

02:54:35.937 --> 02:54:37.429
SAM: If you like murder--
TRAVIS: I'm sure you have a way to get

02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:38.737
everybody out, but we can fly.

02:54:38.737 --> 02:54:40.125
SAM: -- Dwarven Forge.
LAURA: No, no, no.

02:54:40.125 --> 02:54:42.405
I've got a teleport spell and he's got a teleport spell.

02:54:42.405 --> 02:54:44.635
That was the point of keeping us separate.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:54:44.635 --> 02:54:46.015
LAURA: So you guys, if things go to shit

02:54:46.015 --> 02:54:47.669
just bamf out with Caduceus.
TALIESIN: The only thing we need is Beau.

02:54:47.669 --> 02:54:49.045
LAURA: And I'm going to get us out.

02:54:49.045 --> 02:54:51.405
TALIESIN: The second Beau gets back to us, we can bamf.

02:54:51.405 --> 02:54:52.755
MARISHA: I can move fast as fuck.

02:54:52.755 --> 02:54:54.125
I'm good.

02:54:54.125 --> 02:54:55.195
MATT: Okay.

02:54:55.195 --> 02:54:59.288
So, looking into this space,

02:55:00.335 --> 02:55:03.998
the stairs end into just an open blank chamber.

02:55:05.035 --> 02:55:06.825
That's what you can see.

02:55:06.825 --> 02:55:07.825
SAM: Look around for people?

02:55:07.825 --> 02:55:08.658
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:55:08.658 --> 02:55:09.965
MATT: So you want to get down towards the top of it

02:55:09.965 --> 02:55:10.798
and glance in?

02:55:10.798 --> 02:55:11.705
SAM: Yes.

02:55:11.705 --> 02:55:13.315
MATT: You can see two doors.

02:55:13.315 --> 02:55:15.775
Heavily fortified metal doors

02:55:15.775 --> 02:55:17.828
across from you and to the right.

02:55:18.995 --> 02:55:23.768
To match the layout and the map that you were sent.

02:55:23.768 --> 02:55:25.135
LIAM: The one straight ahead is--

02:55:25.135 --> 02:55:26.995
SAM: Is the one we want.
LIAM: -- X marks the spot.

02:55:26.995 --> 02:55:29.512
SAM: But the other one could have really good stuff.

02:55:29.512 --> 02:55:30.361
LIAM: No.

02:55:30.361 --> 02:55:32.086
LAURA: Just go for what we need.
SAM: All right.

02:55:32.086 --> 02:55:33.415
LIAM: I've burned through a lot of myself.

02:55:33.415 --> 02:55:35.065
We need to stay on task.
TALIESIN: Does that X mean

02:55:35.065 --> 02:55:36.065
it's in here? Or does the red X mean--

02:55:36.065 --> 02:55:37.755
SAM: I'll check on that door for traps.
TALIESIN: -- don't go in?

02:55:37.755 --> 02:55:39.835
SAM: The one in front of us.
MARISHA: X marks the spot.

02:55:39.835 --> 02:55:40.668
MATT: Okay.

02:55:42.005 --> 02:55:43.035
LIAM: Don't get close though!

02:55:43.035 --> 02:55:44.545
Don't get close!
SAM: Okay, okay, okay!

02:55:44.545 --> 02:55:45.515
I'll back up! I'll back up!

02:55:45.515 --> 02:55:47.006
I'll cast Mage Hand.

02:55:47.006 --> 02:55:48.805
MATT: Okay.

02:55:48.805 --> 02:55:50.998
Your Mage Hand heads on over,

02:55:52.285 --> 02:55:53.575
and you're going to attempt to--?

02:55:53.575 --> 02:55:54.705
SAM: Check for traps?

02:55:54.705 --> 02:55:57.105
MATT: You can't check with Mage Hand.

02:55:57.105 --> 02:55:59.975
If you know there's a trap there, you can disarm it.

02:55:59.975 --> 02:56:01.305
LIAM: I'm coming down the stairs behind her,

02:56:01.305 --> 02:56:03.105
I still have Detect up

02:56:03.105 --> 02:56:06.105
and there supposedly is another glyph here

02:56:06.105 --> 02:56:07.413
according to the map that Astrid gave us.

02:56:07.413 --> 02:56:08.775
MATT: Correct.
SAM: Oh.

02:56:08.775 --> 02:56:09.705
MATT: Well, here's an interesting point

02:56:09.705 --> 02:56:11.685
which I was going to get to based on as you kind of

02:56:11.685 --> 02:56:12.885
walked down and stopped.

02:56:13.885 --> 02:56:16.515
You walk down into the chamber, and do you still have your

02:56:16.515 --> 02:56:17.845
Detect Magic on?
LIAM: Yes.

02:56:17.845 --> 02:56:20.435
MATT: There is a magical film,

02:56:20.435 --> 02:56:23.835
entirely in a semicircle pattern around you

02:56:23.835 --> 02:56:28.235
that is filling this corner of the chamber.

02:56:28.235 --> 02:56:30.405
LAURA: I come down the stairs, too.

02:56:30.405 --> 02:56:34.185
Wow, they really protect these little things, don't they?

02:56:34.185 --> 02:56:38.398
LIAM: Could you show me again, DM, where that line is?

02:56:39.575 --> 02:56:40.900
SAM: It's blocking both doors.

02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:42.000
LIAM: Both doors.
SAM: Yeah.

02:56:44.395 --> 02:56:45.805
MATT: Like that.
TALIESIN: Ooh, fancy.

02:56:45.805 --> 02:56:48.468
SAM: Ooh, is that a slap bracelet?

02:56:49.339 --> 02:56:50.172
MATT: (chuckles)

02:56:50.172 --> 02:56:54.920
It's a spell... thing.

02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:56.761
My brain. It's a spell thing!

02:56:56.761 --> 02:56:58.345
SAM: A spell slap bracelet.
MATT: There you go.

02:56:58.345 --> 02:56:59.561
LIAM: And what's the school of magic

02:56:59.561 --> 02:57:01.375
that I'm reading off of it?

02:57:01.375 --> 02:57:02.765
MATT: For this it would be--

02:57:02.765 --> 02:57:03.711
TRAVIS: That's really cool, Matt.

02:57:03.711 --> 02:57:07.902
I don't know, this is fucking awesome.

02:57:07.902 --> 02:57:09.585
Little magical barrier in our D&amp;D game.
MATT: Evocation.

02:57:09.585 --> 02:57:10.585
MARISHA: I know, it's so cute.

02:57:10.585 --> 02:57:12.166
TRAVIS: It's awesome.
MATT: (laughs)

02:57:13.003 --> 02:57:13.995
MARISHA: It fits so nicely.

02:57:17.915 --> 02:57:19.078
LAURA: Is it dispellable?

02:57:19.078 --> 02:57:21.478
LIAM: And can I see if there is a difference that--

02:57:23.255 --> 02:57:25.405
Do I see the glyph that is marked on the map?

02:57:25.405 --> 02:57:26.705
And if so, is that separate

02:57:26.705 --> 02:57:30.235
from this sort of line or barrier?

02:57:30.235 --> 02:57:31.275
MATT: You do see the glyph.

02:57:31.275 --> 02:57:33.948
The glyph sits right about there,

02:57:35.045 --> 02:57:38.808
and it also has an evocation energy about it.

02:57:40.246 --> 02:57:43.555
LIAM: (breathes deeply)

02:57:43.555 --> 02:57:44.388
Okay.

02:57:45.947 --> 02:57:46.947
LAURA: What do you think?

02:57:48.705 --> 02:57:51.095
LIAM: I'm going to try to get rid of all of this,

02:57:51.095 --> 02:57:53.465
but I'm going to have very little left.

02:57:53.465 --> 02:57:54.298
LAURA: Okay.

02:57:55.595 --> 02:57:59.803
LIAM: I'm going to cast Dispel at

02:58:01.195 --> 02:58:03.303
5th on this field.

02:58:04.255 --> 02:58:05.411
MATT: At 5th?
LIAM: Yes.

02:58:11.215 --> 02:58:12.515
SAM: He's checking his texts.

02:58:14.995 --> 02:58:18.515
MATT: You release the wave of unraveling arcane energy

02:58:18.515 --> 02:58:20.905
to cancel out whatever lies before you.

02:58:20.905 --> 02:58:22.925
And you watch as-- and you see this as well--

02:58:22.925 --> 02:58:27.925
as what was air, a brief ripple comes across.

02:58:28.025 --> 02:58:29.365
For a brief instant you see what looks to be

02:58:29.365 --> 02:58:31.688
some sort of a wall or a barrier.

02:58:33.755 --> 02:58:34.670
But it remains.

02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:36.421
LIAM: (sighs)

02:58:36.421 --> 02:58:37.779
TRAVIS: That was 5th?

02:58:37.779 --> 02:58:38.805
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yep.

02:58:42.610 --> 02:58:44.736
LIAM: (exhales)

02:58:44.736 --> 02:58:45.569
Okay.

02:58:46.625 --> 02:58:47.745
Shite.

02:58:47.745 --> 02:58:49.808
LAURA: How many big spells do you have left?

02:58:52.205 --> 02:58:54.063
SAM: Gotta use it.

02:58:54.063 --> 02:58:55.305
LIAM: I will try it at 6th.

02:58:56.725 --> 02:58:57.945
MATT: 6th?
LIAM: 6th.

02:59:00.268 --> 02:59:03.045
MATT: (spell whooshes, fizzles)

02:59:03.045 --> 02:59:04.605
SAM: As in gone or still there?
LAURA: It went away?

02:59:04.605 --> 02:59:05.438
MATT: It remains.
LAURA: (gasps)

02:59:05.438 --> 02:59:06.595
LIAM: Remains.

02:59:08.912 --> 02:59:09.745
LAURA: Oh no.

02:59:11.315 --> 02:59:13.905
I can try it at my highest level?

02:59:13.905 --> 02:59:15.055
MATT: Roll an arcana check.

02:59:16.106 --> 02:59:17.138
LAURA: Oh no.

02:59:20.112 --> 02:59:21.128
LIAM: Balls.

02:59:21.128 --> 02:59:22.065
15.

02:59:22.065 --> 02:59:22.915
SAM: That's not bad.

02:59:28.615 --> 02:59:30.855
MATT: Let me double check and see if you have.

02:59:30.855 --> 02:59:32.005
LIAM: Is there anything--

02:59:32.005 --> 02:59:33.765
LAURA: Like, would we see any glyphs it's coming from?

02:59:33.765 --> 02:59:36.085
LIAM: Or devices or sigilry or--

02:59:36.085 --> 02:59:37.695
MATT: You do not.
LIAM: Clockwork? Nothing.

02:59:37.695 --> 02:59:38.528
Blank walls.

02:59:40.725 --> 02:59:41.715
MATT: You do recall

02:59:42.595 --> 02:59:46.045
that the times that Astrid had been here, she says,

02:59:46.045 --> 02:59:49.825
it was accompanied by Trent himself

02:59:49.825 --> 02:59:54.025
and he himself would essentially be able

02:59:54.025 --> 02:59:56.468
to disable these glyphs when he wished to.

02:59:59.095 --> 03:00:02.275
So you can gather that some of these

03:00:02.275 --> 03:00:04.815
are probably in some way connected not to,

03:00:04.815 --> 03:00:05.825
or at least this perhaps

03:00:05.825 --> 03:00:08.225
is not connect to a device that you can see.

03:00:08.225 --> 03:00:09.532
LIAM: A single person?

03:00:09.532 --> 03:00:11.282
MATT: It might be more of a individual.

03:00:15.295 --> 03:00:17.224
SAM: Well, how do we get through it, then?

03:00:17.224 --> 03:00:19.245
TRAVIS: Didn't you smoke a mage upstairs?

03:00:19.245 --> 03:00:20.944
LIAM: I don't know if we do.

03:00:20.944 --> 03:00:22.745
SAM: We did smoke a mage upstairs.

03:00:22.745 --> 03:00:24.035
LAURA: Maybe we can try?

03:00:24.035 --> 03:00:25.145
SAM: Try what?

03:00:25.145 --> 03:00:26.605
LAURA: I'm going to go back upstairs

03:00:26.605 --> 03:00:29.875
and go into the room with the charred mage.

03:00:29.875 --> 03:00:30.708
MATT: Okay.

03:00:30.708 --> 03:00:32.225
LAURA: And bring him down.

03:00:32.225 --> 03:00:33.682
MATT: Oh, the charred mage is at the bottom of the stairs.

03:00:33.682 --> 03:00:34.725
He (thudding).

03:00:34.725 --> 03:00:35.575
LAURA: Oh, he fell!

03:00:35.575 --> 03:00:36.675
MATT: He's tumbled down.

03:00:36.675 --> 03:00:39.365
Because he died right on the edge, fell onto the glyphs,

03:00:39.365 --> 03:00:42.188
sparked off and then fell down the rest of the stairway.

03:00:43.419 --> 03:00:46.535
LAURA: We probably can't push him into the barrier and see.

03:00:46.535 --> 03:00:47.368
MATT: You can if you want.

03:00:47.368 --> 03:00:48.515
You can pick him up and throw him.

03:00:48.515 --> 03:00:50.415
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to just toss him into the barrier.

03:00:50.415 --> 03:00:51.938
SAM: Should we get further back?

03:00:53.125 --> 03:00:53.958
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:54.908 --> 03:00:55.741
LIAM: Yeah.

03:00:55.741 --> 03:00:57.543
SAM: We'll go up the stairs.
LAURA: Yeah, you go up the stairs

03:00:57.543 --> 03:00:59.078
and then I'll chuck him down.

03:00:59.078 --> 03:01:00.202
LIAM: Oh boy.
MATT: Okay.

03:01:00.202 --> 03:01:01.465
LAURA: That's so terrible. (laughs)

03:01:01.465 --> 03:01:04.849
MATT: You go and you throw him, he hits the barrier.

03:01:04.849 --> 03:01:05.885
(thudding)

03:01:05.885 --> 03:01:07.515
You see it shimmer for a second.

03:01:07.515 --> 03:01:11.067
The body just hits, slides to the bottom and comes to rest.

03:01:11.067 --> 03:01:14.615
It didn't seem to damage the body.

03:01:14.615 --> 03:01:16.245
LIAM: Oh.

03:01:16.245 --> 03:01:17.565
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Is there a code?

03:01:17.565 --> 03:01:19.475
LIAM: A Wall of Force.

03:01:19.475 --> 03:01:22.285
SAM: Yeah, but is there a code or does it need to--

03:01:22.285 --> 03:01:24.655
Maybe if you looked like Trent Ikithon.

03:01:24.655 --> 03:01:26.995
MATT: It definitely matches some of the characteristics

03:01:26.995 --> 03:01:30.318
visually and physically to a Wall of Force.

03:01:32.315 --> 03:01:33.655
LAURA: What's a Wall of Force?

03:01:33.655 --> 03:01:36.235
LIAM: Nothing can physically go through it.

03:01:36.235 --> 03:01:37.775
SAM: Unless what?

03:01:37.775 --> 03:01:39.515
LAURA: How high is it? Does it go above the ground?

03:01:39.515 --> 03:01:40.775
Does it go below the ground?

03:01:40.775 --> 03:01:42.515
LIAM: We saw the shimmer, right?

03:01:42.515 --> 03:01:44.466
So when I tried to dispel it.

03:01:44.466 --> 03:01:48.755
MATT: Yes, it fills the entire room in that arc.

03:01:48.755 --> 03:01:52.988
LAURA: Do you know if it would go through the floor, Caleb?

03:01:53.925 --> 03:01:54.895
LIAM: It could.

03:01:54.895 --> 03:01:56.265
It's malleable.

03:01:56.265 --> 03:02:00.585
You can put it into different shapes.

03:02:00.585 --> 03:02:02.815
It could just be simply a wall

03:02:02.815 --> 03:02:04.455
that reaches from the ceiling to the floor.

03:02:04.455 --> 03:02:06.586
It could go into a bubble.

03:02:08.085 --> 03:02:09.938
But it is aiming this way.

03:02:12.172 --> 03:02:16.268
SAM: Can someone get through it with a Dimension Door?

03:02:17.985 --> 03:02:19.143
LIAM: Probably.

03:02:19.143 --> 03:02:20.465
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:02:20.465 --> 03:02:22.812
SAM: Do you want to just go through?

03:02:22.812 --> 03:02:25.505
LAURA: And then try to dispel the glyph on the other side?

03:02:25.505 --> 03:02:27.568
LIAM: I should be able to do that now.

03:02:28.515 --> 03:02:30.815
LAURA: Okay. Try to dispel the glyph.

03:02:30.815 --> 03:02:32.082
SAM: Wait, what?

03:02:32.082 --> 03:02:35.098
LIAM: Magic can go through a Wall of Force.

03:02:36.522 --> 03:02:37.888
LAURA: I could-- Okay.

03:02:38.755 --> 03:02:42.573
I could also try Stone Shape

03:02:42.573 --> 03:02:44.988
to go under it.
LIAM: Yeah, that's a possibility.

03:02:44.988 --> 03:02:46.705
SAM: That would take a while, though.

03:02:46.705 --> 03:02:48.228
LAURA: No, Stone Shape is fast.

03:02:52.615 --> 03:02:54.835
It's an action, it's five feet of--

03:02:55.875 --> 03:02:57.775
SAM: You tell me. You're the magic users.

03:03:00.205 --> 03:03:02.835
LIAM: If it is spherical,

03:03:02.835 --> 03:03:04.025
then you're not going to go through.

03:03:04.025 --> 03:03:08.138
So Dimension Door is probably the smarter way to go here.

03:03:09.035 --> 03:03:10.305
LAURA: Okay.

03:03:10.305 --> 03:03:13.525
SAM: And are you going to try to get inside that room?

03:03:13.525 --> 03:03:14.358
LAURA: Yeah.

03:03:14.358 --> 03:03:15.910
LIAM: Can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic--

03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:17.075
(gasps)

03:03:17.075 --> 03:03:18.225
Oh shit!

03:03:18.225 --> 03:03:19.705
LAURA: What?

03:03:19.705 --> 03:03:21.005
LIAM: Read your spells, folks.

03:03:24.035 --> 03:03:25.185
LAURA: What did he do?
LIAM: I had another way through

03:03:25.185 --> 03:03:26.560
and I just didn't remember it.

03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:28.635
Because it's a new spell.

03:03:28.635 --> 03:03:30.255
LAURA: What's the way through?

03:03:30.255 --> 03:03:31.444
LIAM: Disintegrate.

03:03:31.444 --> 03:03:33.444
LAURA: (sighs)

03:03:37.828 --> 03:03:40.475
SAM: We don't have that anymore, so you're going in.

03:03:40.475 --> 03:03:41.707
LAURA: Okay.

03:03:41.707 --> 03:03:43.825
LIAM: Do you have enough to go
both ways with Dimension Door?

03:03:43.825 --> 03:03:44.658
LAURA: I do.

03:03:47.725 --> 03:03:49.615
But I can only bring one person.

03:03:49.615 --> 03:03:52.538
So I'll probably need Nott to unlock the door.

03:03:53.455 --> 03:03:55.475
SAM: You're going to go into the door?

03:03:55.475 --> 03:03:57.123
LAURA: Yeah, I need you to unlock it.

03:03:57.123 --> 03:03:58.445
It's probably locked.

03:03:58.445 --> 03:04:00.175
LIAM: I'm going to try to first

03:04:01.635 --> 03:04:05.007
dispel the glyph through this because--

03:04:06.090 --> 03:04:07.225
Do I understand the spell correctly:

03:04:07.225 --> 03:04:09.585
only physical things cannot go through it?

03:04:09.585 --> 03:04:11.675
MATT: Nothing can physically pass through the wall.

03:04:11.675 --> 03:04:13.605
LIAM: But magic can be cast through it.

03:04:13.605 --> 03:04:16.585
Globe of Invulnerability is the reverse of that.

03:04:16.585 --> 03:04:20.058
So I'm going to try to dispel the glyph at 4th-level.

03:04:21.605 --> 03:04:22.438
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Did you try that already?

03:04:22.438 --> 03:04:24.317
LIAM: No, I tried to do the wall.

03:04:24.317 --> 03:04:25.150
SAM: Oh.

03:04:26.255 --> 03:04:27.275
LIAM: I didn't know what I was looking at.

03:04:27.275 --> 03:04:29.659
I thought it was something else.

03:04:29.659 --> 03:04:32.295
MATT: It begins to react to the dispel.

03:04:32.295 --> 03:04:35.975
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.

03:04:35.975 --> 03:04:37.045
LIAM: 18.

03:04:37.045 --> 03:04:40.275
MATT: 18. The glyph scatters and then vanishes.

03:04:40.275 --> 03:04:41.735
LAURA: Okay. Okay.

03:04:41.735 --> 03:04:43.715
SAM: Just the glyph, but not the wall?

03:04:43.715 --> 03:04:44.865
LIAM: So the wall's there.

03:04:44.865 --> 03:04:46.568
But if you can go both ways,

03:04:47.505 --> 03:04:48.715
if you can Dimension Door in

03:04:48.715 --> 03:04:50.437
and Dimension Door out with Veth,

03:04:50.437 --> 03:04:52.935
then we might be able to pull this off still.

03:04:52.935 --> 03:04:54.175
LAURA: I'm going to do that.

03:04:54.175 --> 03:04:55.395
SAM: Why do you need me?

03:04:55.395 --> 03:04:56.847
LAURA: To unlock the door!

03:04:56.847 --> 03:04:57.680
SAM: What do you mean unlock the door?

03:04:57.680 --> 03:04:59.432
You can just Dimension Door inside the door!

03:04:59.432 --> 03:05:01.035
LAURA: But I can't see into the room.

03:05:01.035 --> 03:05:01.868
I don't know what's in there.

03:05:01.868 --> 03:05:04.065
I could be bamfing myself into...

03:05:04.065 --> 03:05:06.775
SAM: You can go two feet further into the...

03:05:06.775 --> 03:05:08.020
I'll come with you.

03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:09.645
I'm happy to.
LIAM: It's just a little safer.

03:05:09.645 --> 03:05:10.495
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

03:05:10.495 --> 03:05:11.485
Dimension Door.

03:05:11.485 --> 03:05:13.085
SAM: But just go inside the room!

03:05:13.085 --> 03:05:14.275
Just take us inside the room!

03:05:14.275 --> 03:05:16.205
Why would we meet to unlock the door, too?

03:05:16.205 --> 03:05:17.038
Just go in!

03:05:18.215 --> 03:05:20.045
LAURA: Can't you just Mage Hand through the door?

03:05:20.045 --> 03:05:21.165
I mean, through the force wall?

03:05:21.165 --> 03:05:21.998
SAM: I don't know.

03:05:21.998 --> 03:05:22.875
Sure. I'll try.

03:05:22.875 --> 03:05:25.505
I'll Mage Hand through the Wall of Force.

03:05:25.505 --> 03:05:27.632
Your Mage Hand appears and floats over.

03:05:27.632 --> 03:05:29.025
LAURA: Unlock the door!
MATT: Magic can pass through.

03:05:29.025 --> 03:05:31.095
SAM: Okay. I'll try to unlock the door.

03:05:31.095 --> 03:05:31.928
MATT: Okay.

03:05:34.365 --> 03:05:35.755
SAM: 22.

03:05:35.755 --> 03:05:37.345
MATT: 22.

03:05:37.345 --> 03:05:39.925
The door does not unlock.

03:05:39.925 --> 03:05:42.818
It is a sound lock and that was not high enough.

03:05:45.185 --> 03:05:46.705
SAM: Actually, it would be way less than that

03:05:46.705 --> 03:05:50.042
because my thieves' tools can't go with with the hand.

03:05:50.042 --> 03:05:51.605
It's just a hand.

03:05:51.605 --> 03:05:53.075
MATT: No, I think that's part of what you can do.

03:05:53.075 --> 03:05:54.205
You can use your thieves' tools.

03:05:54.205 --> 03:05:55.945
They can basically carry them over.

03:05:55.945 --> 03:05:57.898
Oh, but they can't physically go through, that's right!

03:05:57.898 --> 03:05:58.731
It would be able to way lower.

03:05:58.731 --> 03:06:00.773
LIAM: Just try to tickle them with your pinky.

03:06:00.773 --> 03:06:02.530
SAM: So let's just go into the room.

03:06:04.765 --> 03:06:06.785
Just three feet on the other side of the door.

03:06:06.785 --> 03:06:08.255
It's not going to be a Pit of Despair,

03:06:08.255 --> 03:06:09.898
and if it is, we're dead.

03:06:09.898 --> 03:06:11.265
LIAM: One foot on the other side of the door.

03:06:11.265 --> 03:06:12.581
LAURA: One foot on the other side of the door.

03:06:12.581 --> 03:06:13.593
SAM: Foot and a half.

03:06:14.475 --> 03:06:15.462
LAURA: Two feet on the other side of door.

03:06:15.462 --> 03:06:17.062
SAM: What if it's a foot-wide door!

03:06:18.195 --> 03:06:19.538
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

03:06:20.979 --> 03:06:22.329
I'm going to Dimension Door

03:06:24.275 --> 03:06:25.255
us into the room.

03:06:25.255 --> 03:06:26.088
MATT: Into the room.

03:06:26.088 --> 03:06:27.370
How deep into the room?

03:06:27.370 --> 03:06:29.713
SAM: ♪ How deep is your love ♪

03:06:29.713 --> 03:06:32.736
MARISHA: ♪ Your love, how deep is your love ♪

03:06:32.736 --> 03:06:34.075
LIAM: ♪ Fusing with a safe ♪

03:06:34.075 --> 03:06:38.142
♪ And it hurts ♪
LAURA: Two feet in.

03:06:39.265 --> 03:06:41.408
MATT: You both appear inside the chamber.

03:06:42.495 --> 03:06:43.495
TRAVIS: Is there a hole in the floor?

03:06:43.495 --> 03:06:44.605
LIAM: Oh, I'm going to puke.

03:06:44.605 --> 03:06:46.775
MATT: There is not a hole in the floor.

03:06:46.775 --> 03:06:47.625
TRAVIS: It looks like a hole in the floor.

03:06:47.625 --> 03:06:51.865
MATT: But you do see a collection of boxes, crates,

03:06:51.865 --> 03:06:55.265
things that are just sitting aside.

03:06:55.265 --> 03:06:57.775
Some of it's empty, but there are--

03:06:58.825 --> 03:07:01.085
it's like a half-filled vault.

03:07:01.085 --> 03:07:02.375
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast--

03:07:02.375 --> 03:07:03.755
SAM: You have your haversack, right?

03:07:03.755 --> 03:07:04.895
LAURA: I do.
SAM: Okay.

03:07:04.895 --> 03:07:06.405
Put that shit in.

03:07:06.405 --> 03:07:07.498
LAURA: Well, we don't know where it is.

03:07:07.498 --> 03:07:08.835
SAM: Just take it all.
LAURA: There's lots of shit, right?

03:07:08.835 --> 03:07:10.605
In here?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:07:10.605 --> 03:07:12.395
LAURA: You should just start grabbing stuff.

03:07:12.395 --> 03:07:13.825
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: I'm going to--

03:07:13.825 --> 03:07:14.865
Oh no.

03:07:14.865 --> 03:07:16.665
MATT: While this is happening...
ASHLEY: Oh no.

03:07:16.665 --> 03:07:17.765
LIAM: Oh boy.

03:07:17.765 --> 03:07:20.165
Beauregard, roll perception check for me, please.

03:07:21.075 --> 03:07:22.905
SAM: What a thrill ride.

03:07:22.905 --> 03:07:23.738
ASHLEY: Furk.

03:07:24.675 --> 03:07:25.758
LIAM: This is the best.

03:07:27.113 --> 03:07:29.111
MARISHA: Oh, that's not good.
SAM: What is that a roll for?

03:07:29.111 --> 03:07:30.528
LAURA: You roll a one?

03:07:31.615 --> 03:07:33.015
MARISHA: Perception check.

03:07:33.015 --> 03:07:34.385
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:07:34.385 --> 03:07:35.315
MATT: I would like...

03:07:37.725 --> 03:07:40.715
You are currently distracted by the slow gurgling

03:07:40.715 --> 03:07:44.565
of the individual that is still somehow hanging on.

03:07:44.565 --> 03:07:46.009
You're like, "Ah, shit."
LAURA: Even after you

03:07:46.009 --> 03:07:46.935
snapped his neck?
MARISHA: Snapped his neck?

03:07:46.935 --> 03:07:47.768
MATT: Yeah.

03:07:47.768 --> 03:07:50.579
LAURA: Oh god! We're terrible.

03:07:50.579 --> 03:07:53.784
TRAVIS: Beau, come on!

03:07:53.784 --> 03:07:56.165
MATT: I'm trying to think what would distract you

03:07:56.165 --> 03:07:57.675
with a natural one.

03:07:57.675 --> 03:07:59.055
Looking out is that.

03:07:59.055 --> 03:07:59.888
That'll distract you.

03:07:59.888 --> 03:08:03.358
MARISHA: I'm just rubbing out
the acid spot like Lady Macbeth.

03:08:03.358 --> 03:08:05.065
(laughter)

03:08:05.065 --> 03:08:06.665
MARISHA: Out, damn spot!

03:08:06.665 --> 03:08:08.168
TALIESIN: -- gas is still making... (gargling)

03:08:08.168 --> 03:08:09.001
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:08:09.001 --> 03:08:10.525
LAURA: Oh god.

03:08:10.525 --> 03:08:11.725
MATT: Anyway, while that's happening,

03:08:11.725 --> 03:08:13.565
because you were keeping watching the far corner,

03:08:13.565 --> 03:08:16.355
I'll have you both roll perception with disadvantage

03:08:16.355 --> 03:08:18.865
with the half-vision you have from that corner

03:08:18.865 --> 03:08:21.175
since you haven't moved from your position.

03:08:21.175 --> 03:08:23.265
You don't have a great bead on the central--

03:08:23.265 --> 03:08:24.105
TALIESIN: Motherfucker!

03:08:24.105 --> 03:08:25.535
TRAVIS: 19?

03:08:25.535 --> 03:08:26.805
MATT: 19?
TRAVIS: Yeah, 16.

03:08:26.805 --> 03:08:30.005
TALIESIN: 12, and thank you for burning a natural 20.

03:08:30.005 --> 03:08:31.780
MATT: Sorry.
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:08:31.780 --> 03:08:32.765
Sorry.

03:08:32.765 --> 03:08:34.455
MATT: With disadvantage.

03:08:34.455 --> 03:08:36.235
TRAVIS: 19 still, that was a natural 20.

03:08:36.235 --> 03:08:37.558
MATT: Wow! Okay!

03:08:39.795 --> 03:08:44.445
You can see a group of soldiers that are emerging

03:08:44.445 --> 03:08:47.035
from one of the nearby hedge openings,

03:08:47.035 --> 03:08:48.775
heading towards this structure.

03:08:48.775 --> 03:08:50.225
TALIESIN: How far away are they?

03:08:50.225 --> 03:08:51.058
MATT: You don't see them.

03:08:51.058 --> 03:08:51.891
TALIESIN: Oh fuck.

03:08:52.825 --> 03:08:55.878
MATT: They are about 50 or so feet from the structure.

03:08:57.495 --> 03:09:01.485
They are being led by a figure

03:09:01.485 --> 03:09:04.013
who is walking with a very brisk pace.

03:09:04.013 --> 03:09:07.965
You see these like long red robes with gold trim.

03:09:07.965 --> 03:09:10.795
You see longish, gray-white hair

03:09:10.795 --> 03:09:13.075
that is just flowing behind with purpose

03:09:13.075 --> 03:09:14.938
as he's bee-lining it there.

03:09:16.605 --> 03:09:21.327
Trent Ikithon is rushing towards this chamber.

03:09:21.327 --> 03:09:23.182
LIAM: Fucking Astrid.

03:09:23.182 --> 03:09:24.912
TRAVIS: We might get our wishes after all.

03:09:24.912 --> 03:09:25.745
I'm going to--

03:09:25.745 --> 03:09:27.335
LIAM: Probably knows when we stepped into the--

03:09:27.335 --> 03:09:29.382
MARISHA: In the room? Yeah.

03:09:29.382 --> 03:09:31.815
TRAVIS: I'm going to back up five feet

03:09:31.815 --> 03:09:35.195
and I'm going to use my Channel Divinity

03:09:35.195 --> 03:09:36.825
and a Marine Layer will start

03:09:36.825 --> 03:09:38.605
to slowly permeate through the woods

03:09:38.605 --> 03:09:42.212
around myself, Yasha, and Caduceus.

03:09:42.212 --> 03:09:43.305
MATT: Great.

03:09:43.305 --> 03:09:47.658
TRAVIS: And I will cast Major Image 120 feet,

03:09:48.765 --> 03:09:52.545
if we are here at this corner, in the opposite direction.

03:09:52.545 --> 03:09:54.455
And against the wrought iron fence

03:09:54.455 --> 03:09:56.875
you will see tearing out from the trees

03:09:56.875 --> 03:09:59.625
a red dragon comes up and smashes up

03:09:59.625 --> 03:10:01.795
against the wrought iron fence,

03:10:01.795 --> 03:10:04.065
fire breathing through, bellowing,

03:10:04.065 --> 03:10:05.573
and the fence rattling.

03:10:05.573 --> 03:10:07.539
(heavy rattling)

03:10:07.539 --> 03:10:09.285
(roaring)

03:10:09.285 --> 03:10:10.858
Just spewing forth.

03:10:11.795 --> 03:10:12.628
MATT: Okay.

03:10:13.695 --> 03:10:16.045
20 foot cube, so this is a smaller dragon

03:10:16.045 --> 03:10:17.245
to fit the wingspan.

03:10:17.245 --> 03:10:18.895
TRAVIS: Just a red dragon, yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

03:10:18.895 --> 03:10:20.425
TRAVIS: But still tearing out of the woods

03:10:20.425 --> 03:10:23.125
of wherever the fuck we are right now.

03:10:23.125 --> 03:10:24.105
MATT: You got it.

03:10:24.105 --> 03:10:27.615
As it slams into it, you see the group of guards,

03:10:27.615 --> 03:10:30.564
which now you can see about four of them, flanking Ikithon,

03:10:30.564 --> 03:10:32.665
and they all look over to the side

03:10:32.665 --> 03:10:34.045
and the guards go, "Shit, shit!"

03:10:34.045 --> 03:10:35.575
They get their weapons and start getting ready

03:10:35.575 --> 03:10:37.655
and Ikithon just looks at it.

03:10:37.655 --> 03:10:39.205
LIAM: Yeah, he doesn't give a fuck.

03:10:40.925 --> 03:10:42.225
MATT: Turns and keeps walking.

03:10:44.335 --> 03:10:45.168
LIAM: He's Mensa.

03:10:46.955 --> 03:10:48.825
MATT: So you're both inside this chamber.

03:10:48.825 --> 03:10:51.635
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate Object.

03:10:51.635 --> 03:10:52.468
MATT: Okay.

03:10:52.468 --> 03:10:56.125
LAURA: For the things.

03:10:56.125 --> 03:10:59.245
MATT: The amulets of protection, all right, you got it.

03:10:59.245 --> 03:11:01.377
You cast the spell and immediately

03:11:01.377 --> 03:11:03.915
beneath a cluster of boxes in the corner,

03:11:03.915 --> 03:11:06.261
you sense numerous.

03:11:07.385 --> 03:11:08.935
You go over and knock them off to the side

03:11:08.935 --> 03:11:09.995
and you see a metal case,

03:11:09.995 --> 03:11:12.775
a long, thin metal case.

03:11:12.775 --> 03:11:13.608
It is locked,

03:11:14.585 --> 03:11:17.295
but you can sense within there are numerous.

03:11:17.295 --> 03:11:18.795
SAM: Should we just take the whole case?

03:11:18.795 --> 03:11:19.965
LAURA: Can I lift it?

03:11:19.965 --> 03:11:21.631
MATT: Yeah, you can lift it.
LAURA: How big is it?

03:11:21.631 --> 03:11:23.125
MATT: I mean, It's long and it's metal.

03:11:23.125 --> 03:11:25.255
It probably weighs 30 pounds.

03:11:25.255 --> 03:11:27.045
It's heavy, but not crazy heavy.
SAM: Put it in your sack?

03:11:27.045 --> 03:11:28.085
LAURA: Yeah, would it fit in the haversack?

03:11:28.085 --> 03:11:28.918
MATT: It would not fit in the haversack.

03:11:28.918 --> 03:11:30.885
LAURA: Okay, then I'm just going to carry it under my arm.

03:11:30.885 --> 03:11:32.445
Grab anything else you see within reach

03:11:32.445 --> 03:11:34.775
and I'll just shove anything else I see,

03:11:34.775 --> 03:11:35.785
I'm going to shove it in my bag

03:11:35.785 --> 03:11:37.985
and then I'm going to cast Dimension Door.

03:11:37.985 --> 03:11:40.158
SAM: I'm going to grab things as well.

03:11:41.835 --> 03:11:45.338
Are there anything grabbable by my little dainty fingers?

03:11:46.219 --> 03:11:47.335
MATT: (laughs)

03:11:47.335 --> 03:11:49.065
A lot of things here are currently contained

03:11:49.065 --> 03:11:51.055
in containers and such.

03:11:51.055 --> 03:11:52.015
You can make an investigation check

03:11:52.015 --> 03:11:53.433
if you want to look through.
SAM: I will.

03:11:53.433 --> 03:11:55.172
Give me 12 seconds!
LAURA: No, hurry!

03:11:55.172 --> 03:11:57.175
SAM: 12 seconds!
LIAM: No, that's too many seconds.

03:11:57.175 --> 03:11:58.685
SAM: Investigation check.

03:11:58.685 --> 03:12:00.752
LIAM: (pigeon cooing) Fuck you, go!
SAM: That's 25.

03:12:00.752 --> 03:12:01.585
MATT: 25?

03:12:01.585 --> 03:12:05.225
SAM: Yeah. I'm just looking for boxes that open or traps.

03:12:05.225 --> 03:12:06.825
I'm looking for traps!

03:12:06.825 --> 03:12:07.658
MATT: Okay.

03:12:09.075 --> 03:12:11.135
You can see that there are no traps,

03:12:11.135 --> 03:12:13.185
but there are a number of

03:12:13.185 --> 03:12:15.085
locked cases of different sizes.

03:12:15.085 --> 03:12:18.195
There's a big, heavy chest type thing.

03:12:18.195 --> 03:12:20.995
There is a smaller case

03:12:20.995 --> 03:12:22.915
that's probably about a foot high

03:12:22.915 --> 03:12:24.615
and about two feet back.

03:12:24.615 --> 03:12:26.005
The smallest case was the one that you found.

03:12:26.005 --> 03:12:28.205
Everything else in here seems under heavier lock and key.

03:12:28.205 --> 03:12:29.938
LAURA: If she doesn't grab anything in three seconds,

03:12:29.938 --> 03:12:30.771
we're out.

03:12:31.725 --> 03:12:34.295
SAM: Are any of them liftable by me?

03:12:34.295 --> 03:12:36.345
MATT: You can make a strength check to grab the next big up?

03:12:36.345 --> 03:12:38.255
SAM: I'm going to try to open one of them.

03:12:38.255 --> 03:12:40.065
MATT: Okay, picking a lock real fast

03:12:40.065 --> 03:12:41.425
is going to be high DC, give it a shot.

03:12:41.425 --> 03:12:42.378
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Oh god.

03:12:43.465 --> 03:12:45.515
SAM: That is good. 28.

03:12:45.515 --> 03:12:47.052
MATT: 28.

03:12:47.052 --> 03:12:49.485
(clicking)

03:12:49.485 --> 03:12:50.465
And it opens up.

03:12:50.465 --> 03:12:52.565
On the inside you can see what looks to be

03:12:53.695 --> 03:12:56.515
a bunch of metallic

03:12:58.675 --> 03:13:01.175
containers that are filled with crystals.

03:13:01.175 --> 03:13:02.345
Blue crystals.

03:13:02.345 --> 03:13:05.104
All long, thin pointed crystals.

03:13:05.104 --> 03:13:06.925
SAM: Yeah.

03:13:06.925 --> 03:13:08.065
MATT: Okay, you just start grabbing them.

03:13:08.065 --> 03:13:09.315
SAM: Yep. As many as I can.

03:13:09.315 --> 03:13:10.695
Pop them in the sack, pop it in my pocket.

03:13:10.695 --> 03:13:14.135
MATT: As you guys are reacting, see Trent Ikithon see this,

03:13:14.135 --> 03:13:17.481
look back, narrows his eyes and then vanishes from sight.

03:13:17.481 --> 03:13:18.622
LAURA: I'm going to go grab the back of--
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:13:18.622 --> 03:13:20.948
TRAVIS: He vanishes? He just poofs, gone?

03:13:22.095 --> 03:13:24.236
MATT: It seemed like what may have been

03:13:25.244 --> 03:13:26.875
an informed disturbance

03:13:26.875 --> 03:13:30.065
has elevated his need for haste

03:13:30.065 --> 03:13:32.315
with the appearance of an illusory dragon.

03:13:33.417 --> 03:13:34.985
SAM: Okay. Bamf me outta here.

03:13:34.985 --> 03:13:38.408
LAURA: I'm Dimension Dooring me and Veth back to Caleb.

03:13:41.525 --> 03:13:43.398
And hopefully this works.

03:13:44.375 --> 03:13:45.795
Tell them to get out.

03:13:45.795 --> 03:13:47.695
Tell them to get out!
SAM: Oh yes, sorry!

03:13:48.905 --> 03:13:50.278
Casting to Yasha.

03:13:51.395 --> 03:13:52.465
Red hot, red hot!

03:13:52.465 --> 03:13:53.305
We're leaving fast!

03:13:53.305 --> 03:13:54.225
Get outta here! Move!

03:13:54.225 --> 03:13:55.058
Get! Go!

03:13:55.058 --> 03:13:56.806
ASHLEY: Red hot, red hot, red hot!

03:13:56.806 --> 03:13:58.785
MARISHA: I see their signal

03:13:58.785 --> 03:14:01.635
and I run and I just jump over the edge.

03:14:01.635 --> 03:14:03.545
SAM: You don't see their signal.

03:14:03.545 --> 03:14:06.115
MARISHA: They signaled to me.
SAM: You're in a Marine Layer!

03:14:06.115 --> 03:14:07.545
MARISHA: Did you cast Marine Layer?

03:14:07.545 --> 03:14:08.955
MATT: Mm-hmm, you look over and you just see

03:14:08.955 --> 03:14:10.985
a large thing of fog.

03:14:10.985 --> 03:14:12.585
MARISHA: Do I see a red dragon?

03:14:12.585 --> 03:14:13.865
MATT: You do see a red dragon.

03:14:13.865 --> 03:14:17.275
And there are guards that are currently like, (grunting)

03:14:17.275 --> 03:14:19.065
They're trying to attack it and they're backing up.

03:14:19.065 --> 03:14:21.115
and one of them's screaming and running.

03:14:22.215 --> 03:14:24.455
MARISHA: I'm still going to jump off of the tower

03:14:24.455 --> 03:14:28.218
and nestle near that door that Jester painted.

03:14:29.055 --> 03:14:29.888
MATT: Okay.

03:14:31.025 --> 03:14:32.305
You nestle near the door that Jester painted.

03:14:32.305 --> 03:14:33.705
You go it.
TALIESIN: That wasn't the plan.

03:14:33.705 --> 03:14:36.815
MARISHA: I have not heard from anybody red hot.

03:14:36.815 --> 03:14:38.265
I have not heard from anybody.

03:14:38.265 --> 03:14:39.585
TALIESIN: Can we message her?

03:14:39.585 --> 03:14:41.088
TRAVIS: Nope.
MARISHA: No!

03:14:41.088 --> 03:14:43.349
SAM: Yasha <i>thinks</i> she can.
ASHLEY: Veth, I heard you loud and clear!

03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:44.634
We are waiting for you!

03:14:44.634 --> 03:14:47.085
TRAVIS: (laughs)
ASHLEY: Ready for you!

03:14:47.085 --> 03:14:49.360
MARISHA: I am just fixated towards that dragon

03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:52.335
and the fog cloud. Just eyes peeled, waiting for anything.

03:14:52.335 --> 03:14:53.168
MATT: You got it.

03:14:55.531 --> 03:14:56.364
TALIESIN: I'm going to start moving

03:14:56.364 --> 03:14:57.680
towards the edge of the fog cloud.

03:14:57.680 --> 03:14:58.835
LAURA: Hopefully they'll get--

03:14:58.835 --> 03:15:00.895
I'm going to try to do this.

03:15:00.895 --> 03:15:01.728
I hope it works.

03:15:01.728 --> 03:15:03.995
And I'm going to cast Word of Recall

03:15:03.995 --> 03:15:08.525
as soon as I'm touching Caleb and Veth.

03:15:08.525 --> 03:15:10.418
MATT: Okay. You cast Word of Recall.

03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:14.408
MARISHA: Bye! See you in Nicodranas.

03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:17.135
MATT: It doesn't work.

03:15:17.135 --> 03:15:17.968
(gasping)

03:15:17.968 --> 03:15:18.801
LIAM: (sighs)

03:15:20.765 --> 03:15:21.598
No in or out.

03:15:22.485 --> 03:15:24.205
With that kind of stuff, maybe.

03:15:24.205 --> 03:15:27.042
MATT: And as you can't figure what's happening--

03:15:27.042 --> 03:15:28.585
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:15:28.585 --> 03:15:30.638
MATT: -- you hear from the top of the stairs--

03:15:32.185 --> 03:15:33.575
LAURA: He counterspelled me.
SAM: Oh--

03:15:33.575 --> 03:15:36.460
MATT: "Well, if this isn't extremely curious."

03:15:38.282 --> 03:15:39.115
And we're going to end the episode there.

03:15:39.115 --> 03:15:42.000
ALL: No!

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:42.833
MARISHA: No!

03:15:43.896 --> 03:15:45.545
LIAM: Oh my god!

03:15:45.545 --> 03:15:46.378
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:15:47.778 --> 03:15:48.877
ASHLEY: This is not good!

03:15:48.877 --> 03:15:50.694
SAM: Oh, no, it's not!

03:15:50.694 --> 03:15:52.117
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:15:53.805 --> 03:15:54.726
TALIESIN: This is so us.

03:15:54.726 --> 03:15:56.667
ASHLEY: No, we have to keep playing!

03:15:56.667 --> 03:15:58.031
MATT: (laughs)

03:15:58.031 --> 03:15:59.096
Nah, we're--

03:16:01.645 --> 03:16:03.605
Depending on what transpires next

03:16:03.605 --> 03:16:05.415
it could be very quick or very long, I don't know.

03:16:05.415 --> 03:16:07.305
So we're going to pick that up next episode.

03:16:07.305 --> 03:16:09.191
LAURA: Oh god.

03:16:09.191 --> 03:16:10.024
SAM: Oh god!

03:16:10.935 --> 03:16:14.650
MATT: Half the party with a huge archmage,

03:16:14.650 --> 03:16:15.794
half your slots gone.

03:16:15.794 --> 03:16:17.515
TALIESIN: But at least you got those blue crystals.

03:16:17.515 --> 03:16:19.195
SAM: I got those blue crystals.

03:16:19.195 --> 03:16:20.135
TALIESIN: We're good now.

03:16:20.135 --> 03:16:20.968
SAM: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:16:20.968 --> 03:16:22.268
LAURA: So-- oh god.

03:16:22.268 --> 03:16:24.578
MATT: Weirdly, that was what did it.

03:16:24.578 --> 03:16:26.425
LAURA: It was?
SAM: My greed?

03:16:26.425 --> 03:16:27.766
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Well, Veth and me

03:16:27.766 --> 03:16:31.016
summoning a red dragon that he knew was

03:16:31.016 --> 03:16:32.285
a diversion.
MATT: That too, yeah.

03:16:32.285 --> 03:16:33.705
I mean, it kept the guards off.

03:16:33.705 --> 03:16:34.595
Kept the guards off.

03:16:34.595 --> 03:16:36.845
Yeah. He wouldn't have gotten there that quickly

03:16:36.845 --> 03:16:39.193
if he wasn't set off that there was--

03:16:39.193 --> 03:16:43.035
what was from his standpoint, a definite diversion.

03:16:43.035 --> 03:16:44.175
TRAVIS: That's fair. That's fair.

03:16:44.175 --> 03:16:45.825
ASHLEY: I would've done the same thing.

03:16:46.755 --> 03:16:48.515
MATT: So we'll pick up from there next week.

03:16:48.515 --> 03:16:50.675
MARISHA: And half the team got told, "Red hot,"

03:16:50.675 --> 03:16:52.461
and I'm just really confused.
SAM: We're not going to leave

03:16:52.461 --> 03:16:56.038
without you, but where are you?

03:16:56.038 --> 03:16:56.915
Oh my god!
MARISHA: But then

03:16:56.915 --> 03:16:58.275
what are you guys going to say?

03:16:58.275 --> 03:16:59.895
You guys got to tip us off.

03:16:59.895 --> 03:17:01.138
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you don't say anything

03:17:01.138 --> 03:17:02.805
the minute we get her back, we're out.

03:17:02.805 --> 03:17:03.845
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Well, I've already said

03:17:03.845 --> 03:17:05.325
what we're going to say.

03:17:05.325 --> 03:17:06.778
TALIESIN: So unless you've got another message...

03:17:06.778 --> 03:17:08.020
ASHLEY: We might have to go in there now!

03:17:08.020 --> 03:17:09.351
MATT: We have a week to figure this out.

03:17:09.351 --> 03:17:10.488
SAM: Oh my god.

03:17:10.488 --> 03:17:12.955
MARISHA: You got time because Beau is separated.

03:17:12.955 --> 03:17:15.984
Had I not been, then we probably would've bamfed.

03:17:15.984 --> 03:17:17.155
MATT: (laughs)

03:17:17.155 --> 03:17:20.155
LIAM: I am pinging to you, and if I see him,

03:17:20.155 --> 03:17:23.107
I mean, I would--

03:17:23.107 --> 03:17:25.245
MARISHA: We'll figure it out.
LIAM: Next time.

03:17:25.245 --> 03:17:26.515
MARISHA: Fuck.
LIAM: Wow.

03:17:26.515 --> 03:17:27.445
MATT: We'll pick up there.

03:17:27.445 --> 03:17:28.575
TALIESIN: Cool.
MATT: Oh man.

03:17:28.575 --> 03:17:30.375
LIAM: We got the box!
LAURA: Oh no!

03:17:30.375 --> 03:17:32.255
MARISHA: Got the box!

03:17:32.255 --> 03:17:33.785
SAM: I got some vials, guys!

03:17:33.785 --> 03:17:34.785
LIAM: Oh my god.

03:17:35.665 --> 03:17:37.153
SAM: I blame Jester.

03:17:37.153 --> 03:17:38.815
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:17:38.815 --> 03:17:40.315
MATT: It was a weird series of events.

03:17:40.315 --> 03:17:42.705
It was the multiple Fireballs,

03:17:42.705 --> 03:17:45.248
to the guards managing to go and inform somebody.

03:17:45.248 --> 03:17:46.873
MARISHA: Was it Astrid?

03:17:46.873 --> 03:17:47.938
That bitch.

03:17:47.938 --> 03:17:49.718
SAM: I think it wasn't Astrid.

03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:53.405
TALIESIN: We literally were blowing shit up

03:17:53.405 --> 03:17:55.217
inside the building.

03:17:55.217 --> 03:17:56.233
Yeah.
MATT: Anyway.

03:17:56.233 --> 03:17:57.834
TALIESIN: That was not stealthy.
SAM: (laughs)

03:17:57.834 --> 03:17:59.015
MATT: Thank you all for joining us.

03:17:59.015 --> 03:18:01.365
We'll pick up on this insanity next time.

03:18:01.365 --> 03:18:02.395
We love you very much.

03:18:02.395 --> 03:18:04.145
And is it Thursday yet?

03:18:04.145 --> 03:18:05.062
Good night.

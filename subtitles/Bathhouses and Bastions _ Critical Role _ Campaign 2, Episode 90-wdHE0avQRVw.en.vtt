00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:02.912
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.912 --> 00:00:04.788
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:06.650
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.368
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
TRAVIS: 2020!

5
00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.486
MARISHA: In 2020!

6
00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:13.761
MATT: We are back! We've missed you guys.

7
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.905
Hope you've had a decent break.

8
00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.889
We have mostly rejuvenated with what time we had.

9
00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:22.103
Hopefully we'll catch up the rest

10
00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:24.117
before the end of the world.

11
00:00:24.117 --> 00:00:26.804
But we've missed you, we're happy to be back,

12
00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.790
and before we get into tonight's session,

13
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.615
we have some announcements to go through,

14
00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.343
so we'll go ahead and jump in with our first

15
00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:35.759
of two sponsors tonight: Skillshare. Sam?

16
00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:37.661
LAURA: Ooh.

17
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:39.050
SAM: Goo goo gaga.

18
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.771
It's me, the cutest green guy in the galaxy,

19
00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:43.466
Baby Fucking Yoda!

20
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.441
And speaking of stars, I'm the fucking

21
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.024
number one celebrity in Hollywood.

22
00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:51.255
Who woulda thought a 50 year old man-baby

23
00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:53.646
would be the toast of this town?

24
00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:56.489
A couple of months ago, I couldn't even get an audition

25
00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.762
for NCIS: New Orleans, but now my phone's

26
00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:01.763
ringing off the fucking hook!

27
00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:05.493
My agents, Joel and Barry, at the Death Star, sorry, CAA,

28
00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:10.490
got all kinds of meetings lined up.

29
00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:16.407
They're like, "Oh, Yoda baby, NBC wants to reboot ALF,

30
00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:20.448
"Kevin Hart is asking you to play his brother in Jumanji 3,

31
00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:22.591
"and we're trying to get Scarlett Johansson

32
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:26.483
"to co-star in a sexy remake of Look Who's Talking."

33
00:01:26.483 --> 00:01:28.727
But I'm like, come on, fellas.

34
00:01:28.727 --> 00:01:31.085
Do or do not, there is no try.

35
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:33.618
Meetings don't pay the rent, you know?

36
00:01:33.618 --> 00:01:36.335
We need to put the green in green lit.

37
00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:38.977
So I told my agents to book me some commercial work

38
00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:41.482
to tide me over, which is why they booked me

39
00:01:41.482 --> 00:01:45.290
on this dumb show to read your fucking ads, so here we go.

40
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:50.915
Our brand new sponsor this week is Skillshare,

41
00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:54.231

43
00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:58.362

44
00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:01.049

about a baby Yoda who gets into Harvard

52
00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:20.026
called Legally Green.

53
00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:22.146
Skillshare... (laughing)

54
00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:23.753

00:02:23.753 --> 00:02:26.559

65
00:02:52.294 --> 00:02:53.821
ASHLEY: Oh, wow.

66
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:57.208
TRAVIS: Oh god.
LIAM: (punching)

67
00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.527
SAM: Hey, Baby Yoda says thanks to Skillshare

68
00:03:00.527 --> 00:03:01.949
for joining the show.

69
00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.102
Now get my agent on the phone!

70
00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:06.365
Oh, hey, I'm a child.

71
00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:07.837
(laughter)

72
00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:09.450
TRAVIS: Why does it look like you shoved your face

73
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.616
in an airplane toilet?

74
00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:13.478
SAM: I was told this was green.

75
00:03:13.478 --> 00:03:15.926
(laughter)

76
00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:18.257
I may have been misinformed.

77
00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:20.939
MARISHA: Yeah, they were colorblind. Yeah, yeah.

78
00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.241
SAM: Baby Yoda out! Back to you, Matt!

79
00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:25.578
MATT: Welcome back, Sam.

80
00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:27.368
Happy to have you back in all of this.

81
00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:29.601
LAURA: That was my least favorite ad you've ever done.

82
00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:30.550
SAM: Wow.

83
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.623
LIAM: Really? I felt like a few have been worse.

84
00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:35.381
TALIESIN: Oh no, I can definitely think of worse.

85
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.375
SAM: It's Baby Fucking Yoda, guys!

86
00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:38.521
MARISHA: (laughs)

87
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:41.028
SAM: Who doesn't love Baby Fucking Yoda?
TRAVIS: You need a stogie.

88
00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:43.271
SAM: I do need a stogie. Next time, next time.

89
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.591
LAURA: This is straight out of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."
MATT: No, don't say there's a next time.

90
00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:48.442
ASHLEY: I mean, "Ewok to Remember" might be your best joke.

91
00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:51.058
(groaning laughter)

92
00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:53.767
I'm a fan, and I want that movie.

93
00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.215
Can we make it?

94
00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:57.057
MATT: Don't say it too loud.
ASHLEY: Marisha?

95
00:03:57.057 --> 00:03:59.036
MATT: We get enough new Star Wars content,

96
00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:01.228
it'll show up on Disney Plus.

97
00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:04.223
Thank you, Sam, and thank you Skillshare

98
00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:05.961

99
00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:08.269

101

No, it's great, no, fanfare's good.

104
00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.111
Those of you who haven't had a chance to check it out,

105
00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:20.735
D&amp;D Beyond is a fantastic online digital tool set

TRAVIS: Yeah!

116
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.781
MATT: So as a heads up, too,
a couple quick announcements beyond that.

117
00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:49.957
Critical Recap, our episode-by-episode breakdown

118
00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:52.382
of our campaign, has moved to written form now,

119
00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:54.920
so easier for you guys to watch at work, actually.

120
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.893
So check out Dani Carr's incredible summaries

121
00:04:56.893 --> 00:04:59.524

122
00:04:59.524 --> 00:05:00.773
(cheering)

123
00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:02.863
We also wanted to take a moment to bring awareness

124
00:05:02.863 --> 00:05:05.629
to two major emergencies that have happened recently,

125
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.941
and encourage all of you guys who have the opportunity

126
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:10.336
and the capability to do so, to support

127
00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:12.635
reputable organizations that are doing work

128
00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:14.501
to help people in Puerto Rico who are suffering

129
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.775
from the recent earthquake, people who are in Australia

130
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.347
that are currently dealing with the terrible fires there

131
00:05:18.347 --> 00:05:20.783
that are still ravaging it.

132
00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:23.215
It's been a massive effort for people,

133
00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:26.409
both helping communities in both places,

134
00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.185
and if you are able to, please go ahead and make a donation

135
00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:32.177
to one of the many nonprofit organizations

136
00:05:32.177 --> 00:05:34.823
that are helming a lot of the positive aspects

137
00:05:34.823 --> 00:05:36.992
of recovery in these places.

138
00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:40.160
We've done a little post on the Crit Role Twitter

139
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.599
outlining one article that has a good example

140
00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:43.762
of those there, so check it out

141
00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:45.199
if you don't have a source yet,

142
00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.832
and if you have, thank you very much for your support

143
00:05:46.832 --> 00:05:49.087
in helping these people.

144
00:05:50.012 --> 00:05:54.293
I think that's it as far as our announcements go.

145
00:05:54.293 --> 00:05:59.293
So, with that, let's ring in 2020.

146
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.518
MARISHA: Bring it back.

00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:35.773

181
00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:39.641
(flames whooshing)

182
00:07:43.908 --> 00:07:45.605
MATT: And welcome back.

183
00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:46.563
(laughter)

184
00:07:46.563 --> 00:07:48.031
LIAM: Yes!

185
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:49.972
MATT: The year has begun.

186
00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:51.403
TALIESIN: First point of 2020.

187
00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:53.584
MATT: First point of 2020 goes to Liam.

188
00:07:53.584 --> 00:07:54.667
Goddamn it.

189
00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:56.611
It was more the volume I think that got me,

190
00:07:56.611 --> 00:07:58.969
more than the content.

191
00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:00.620
LAURA: It was aggressive.

192
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.557
MATT: It was very aggressive.

193
00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:03.862
LIAM: It's about quantity, guys, not quality.

194
00:08:04.837 --> 00:08:06.754
MATT: That's very not true.

195
00:08:08.445 --> 00:08:12.266
So, last we left off, The Mighty Nein,

196
00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:16.421
after foiling the plot of the cult of the Angel of Irons

197
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:18.685
and its unknown following of Tharizdun,

198
00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:22.968
had found themselves uneasily drawn into the throne room

199
00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:26.146
of King Dwendal himself.

200
00:08:26.146 --> 00:08:29.815
During this time, your involvement with the Kryn Dynasty

201
00:08:29.815 --> 00:08:33.829
during this war between the two nations came to light,

202
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:37.436
and you were asked as part of essentially proving

203
00:08:37.436 --> 00:08:40.743
this supposed loyalty that you claimed to have to the Empire

204
00:08:40.743 --> 00:08:43.968
to reach out on their behalf to negotiate,

205
00:08:43.968 --> 00:08:48.022
or to convince them to come to some sort of a parley,

206
00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:50.813
a negotiation to possibly bring this war

207
00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:53.570
to lesser terms or to an end.

208
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.333
You are at your own pace on this,

209
00:08:57.333 --> 00:09:00.961
after being assigned under Martinet Ludinus Da'leth,

210
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.091
the head of the Cerberus Assembly,

211
00:09:04.091 --> 00:09:07.595
and said whenever you need to, but the longer you wait,

212
00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:11.587
the more tension lies behind this temporary ceasefire

213
00:09:11.587 --> 00:09:14.270
between the two nations.

214
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.580
You had a run-in with Trent Ikithon, confirmed that

215
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.251
it seemed that they had an additional beacon

216
00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:21.617
that from your research you found seemed to

217
00:09:21.617 --> 00:09:25.481
have actually been uncovered out near Pride's Call,

218
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:28.193
and were planning to return this beacon

219
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:31.462
to the Dynasty as part of this negotiation,

220
00:09:31.462 --> 00:09:35.837
while seemingly keeping one for themselves, possibly.

221
00:09:35.837 --> 00:09:40.543
You decided in your break time to make some purchases,

222
00:09:40.543 --> 00:09:43.045
make some orders, get a bone flute,

223
00:09:43.045 --> 00:09:44.495
(laughter)

224
00:09:44.495 --> 00:09:46.937
order a bone harp,

225
00:09:46.937 --> 00:09:50.511
order a jeweled chalice,

226
00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:55.346
and get involved in some underground fighting,

227
00:09:55.346 --> 00:09:58.022
in which you put some money down,

228
00:09:58.022 --> 00:10:01.657
Beauregard beat up an older gentleman--

229
00:10:01.657 --> 00:10:03.570
MARISHA: Yeah!

230
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.765
MATT: Two paladins went head-to-head, and it did not end

231
00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:09.641
in Fjord's favor.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

232
00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:12.745
MATT: And Yasha worked through some physical therapy.

233
00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:15.662
MARISHA: Oh!
ASHLEY: I forgot about that.

234
00:10:17.498 --> 00:10:19.627
MATT: Bloodied and sore, your friends picked you up,

235
00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:23.715
and we left off as you made your way out of the butchery

236
00:10:23.715 --> 00:10:26.292
that hides this underground fight pit,

237
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.389
made your way back to the inn

238
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:33.389
to wrap up the evening and get some rest to recover,

239
00:10:33.491 --> 00:10:34.710
and lead to the following day,

240
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.933
to whatever your endeavors may be.

241
00:10:35.933 --> 00:10:37.816
Is there any business you want to deal with

242
00:10:37.816 --> 00:10:40.332
when you return to the Camarouth Cottage,

243
00:10:40.332 --> 00:10:43.899
or do you want to move on to the morning?

244
00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:50.496
TRAVIS: I'm going to fall asleep, and just lick my wounds.

245
00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:54.709
MATT: All right. You guys all head to your respective rooms.

246
00:10:54.709 --> 00:10:58.264
LAURA: As a healer, I think you really
shouldn't lick them, though.

247
00:10:58.264 --> 00:11:00.375
TRAVIS: I thought saliva was, like, quite clean.

248
00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:01.713
MARISHA: Yeah, isn't it, like, sterile?

249
00:11:01.713 --> 00:11:02.564
Isn't that what they say?

250
00:11:02.564 --> 00:11:04.954
ASHLEY: Isn't that like a dog?

251
00:11:04.954 --> 00:11:07.192
LIAM: You're thinking of urine.

252
00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:11.262
LAURA: Oh yes, definitely pee on your wounds.

253
00:11:11.262 --> 00:11:13.382
But don't lick them.
TRAVIS: Pee?

254
00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:14.901
LAURA: Yeah, if you can pee on them, I don't know,

255
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.109
it might be difficult, but.

256
00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:17.852
MARISHA: Unless you have a dog to pee on them?

257
00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:20.986
Or wait, no, a dog to lick them.
LAURA: Dog pee is not sanitary, no.

258
00:11:20.986 --> 00:11:22.887
MARISHA: But a dog saliva?

259
00:11:22.887 --> 00:11:24.935
Nevermind, we're over-complicating.
SAM: Good night, everybody.

260
00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:27.602
(laughter)

261
00:11:28.624 --> 00:11:33.524
ASHLEY: But you can use urine of a dog for a jellyfish...

262
00:11:33.524 --> 00:11:34.582
bite.

263
00:11:34.582 --> 00:11:36.944
LAURA: You can use people pee, too, for that.

264
00:11:36.944 --> 00:11:38.539
ASHLEY: People pee as well, yeah.

265
00:11:38.539 --> 00:11:40.372
MARISHA: Wait, a bite?

266
00:11:41.471 --> 00:11:44.232
ASHLEY: Yeah, they have teeth.

267
00:11:44.232 --> 00:11:45.065
MARISHA: Holy shit.

268
00:11:45.065 --> 00:11:48.912
ASHLEY: It's a whole jaw system that's underneath.

269
00:11:48.912 --> 00:11:50.786
MARISHA: I haven't studied much marine life.
SAM: Wait, I'm back. What is this?

270
00:11:50.786 --> 00:11:53.385
What's going on? I've missed something.

271
00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:56.469
ASHLEY: It's the anatomy of a jellyfish.

272
00:11:56.469 --> 00:12:00.220
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, yeah. Terrifying mouths.
SAM: Canon.

273
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.496
TRAVIS: Parroted, clawed, fanged teeth.

274
00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:05.288
ASHLEY: It's a whole face underneath.

275
00:12:05.288 --> 00:12:07.898
You know, they lift it up and--
LIAM: Ah!

276
00:12:07.898 --> 00:12:09.739
MARISHA: It's kind of cute.

277
00:12:09.739 --> 00:12:11.015
ASHLEY: I'm going to go to bed.

278
00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:11.973
MARISHA: Same.

279
00:12:11.973 --> 00:12:15.752
MATT: You guys, those who are messes
clean yourselves up a bit

280
00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:17.093
and head to your--

281
00:12:17.093 --> 00:12:18.384
(disappointed sigh)

282
00:12:19.693 --> 00:12:22.505
head to your rooms for the night to rest.

283
00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:25.074
LIAM: Stretch that out for us?

284
00:12:25.074 --> 00:12:27.288
That's the existential dread I'm here for.

285
00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:28.849
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: Yeah.

286
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:30.553
LAURA: Yeah.

287
00:12:30.553 --> 00:12:33.089
MATT: (sighs)

288
00:12:33.089 --> 00:12:35.515
SAM: It was in the rotation, Matt.

289
00:12:35.515 --> 00:12:36.951
I can't--
MATT: You're still doing this!

290
00:12:36.951 --> 00:12:38.263
You're still doing this!

291
00:12:38.263 --> 00:12:41.282
LAURA: He's still doing it.
SAM: I'm still doing this.

292
00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:44.192
It's in the rotation, I can't change the history.
TRAVIS: Where is that picture from?

293
00:12:44.192 --> 00:12:45.781
MATT: That was from the old studio.

294
00:12:45.781 --> 00:12:46.614
Yeah.

295
00:12:46.614 --> 00:12:48.791
That was, like, two years ago.

296
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:49.624
Wow.

297
00:12:49.624 --> 00:12:51.103
SAM: I don't even know anymore.

298
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.028
(laughter)

299
00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:54.384
TRAVIS: Do you just have a box, a closet, of Mercer shirts?

300
00:12:54.384 --> 00:12:55.921
SAM: I have four drawers of t-shirts.

301
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:57.625
ASHLEY: Four drawers of Matt?
LAURA: <i>Four</i> drawers?!

302
00:12:57.625 --> 00:13:00.334
SAM: No, not all Matt, some are me.

303
00:13:00.334 --> 00:13:02.609
MATT: How's Q feel about that?

304
00:13:02.609 --> 00:13:04.224
SAM: She doesn't need to know about those.

305
00:13:04.224 --> 00:13:05.515
(laughter)

306
00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:07.273
MATT: Have, like, a hidden trap drawer?

307
00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:08.623
All right.

308
00:13:08.623 --> 00:13:10.472
As you guys make your way to your rooms

309
00:13:10.472 --> 00:13:14.213
to rest for the night, you find yourselves

310
00:13:14.213 --> 00:13:19.213
resting carefully, and you awaken the next morning,

311
00:13:19.477 --> 00:13:22.977
recovered and ready for the day.

312
00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:27.675
Breakfast is prepared and purchasable, should you wish,

313
00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:32.044
as that was not part of your terms of staying here,

314
00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:34.749
under the Assembly.

315
00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:36.963
But for the majority of you to eat for the morning,

316
00:13:36.963 --> 00:13:41.073
it's not too bad, I'd say, I'd put you at about

317
00:13:41.073 --> 00:13:44.814
four or five silver for everyone.

318
00:13:44.814 --> 00:13:46.453
LAURA: I've got it.
SAM: Wow!

319
00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:49.629
MARISHA: Jester's got it.
MATT: Jester's jumping up.

320
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.425
TRAVIS: Do you do fasted cardio in the morning?

321
00:13:51.425 --> 00:13:54.444
Or is it, like, eat and then work out?

322
00:13:54.444 --> 00:13:57.707
MARISHA: No, no, no, fasted cardio, absolutely.

323
00:13:57.707 --> 00:13:59.277
TRAVIS: We just ate.
MARISHA: Yeah.

324
00:13:59.277 --> 00:14:02.835
TRAVIS: You were working out before this?

325
00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:04.060
You skipped a day.
MARISHA: Yeah.

326
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.933
TRAVIS: Got it, okay.

327
00:14:04.933 --> 00:14:06.471
Just make sure you let me know, because--

328
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.189
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: All right.

329
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:10.990
Sometimes I'll just do some light pushups in the room,

330
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.285
that's what I did today.

331
00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:14.568
TRAVIS: While you still have dragon breath?

332
00:14:14.568 --> 00:14:15.719
MARISHA: Yeah.

333
00:14:15.719 --> 00:14:16.837
God, I never thought about that.

334
00:14:16.837 --> 00:14:19.929
Maybe I should ask the girls if that's a problem.

335
00:14:19.929 --> 00:14:22.065
TRAVIS: I mean, it's--
MARISHA: Is it a problem?

336
00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:24.182
TRAVIS: Right now, yeah, I'm just letting you know.

337
00:14:24.182 --> 00:14:27.981
Maybe, like, brush your teeth, then work out, then eat.

338
00:14:27.981 --> 00:14:30.166
MARISHA: Thank you for telling me.

339
00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:32.906
Not a lot of people would.

340
00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.650
I'm just very honored.
TRAVIS: Okay.

341
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.544
MARISHA: Okay, sorry.

342
00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:37.377
(laughter)

343
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.510
SAM: Do we own toothbrushes?

344
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.519
MARISHA: (giggling)

345
00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:44.522
SAM: It doesn't say in my equipment on D&amp;D Beyond.

346
00:14:44.522 --> 00:14:46.024
(laughter)

347
00:14:46.024 --> 00:14:48.107
SAM: I don't brush these!

348
00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:51.155
TALIESIN: Can we go to a blacksmith to get some

349
00:14:51.155 --> 00:14:53.557
toothbrushes, possibly? I don't know.
TRAVIS: Charcoal paste?

350
00:14:53.557 --> 00:14:56.253
LIAM: Can you hear all this dragging of
heels to get to the actual story?

351
00:14:56.253 --> 00:14:58.920
(laughter)

352
00:15:02.457 --> 00:15:06.499
MATT: Meal is had, day is yours, what would you like to do?

353
00:15:06.499 --> 00:15:10.389
LAURA: How long was it going to take
for the chalice to be made?

354
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:11.708
MATT: I think she said a day or two.

355
00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:13.041
LAURA: Two days? Okay.

356
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:18.690
MARISHA: So we should go talk to what's-his-butt?

357
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.751
Shit, I've forgotten everything!

358
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:22.592
TRAVIS: Who, Ludinus?
MARISHA: Yes.

359
00:15:22.592 --> 00:15:26.752
Is it time to liaise with Ludinus?

360
00:15:26.752 --> 00:15:28.660
TRAVIS: I don't think so.
LAURA: About what?

361
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.218
What would we say to him?
SAM: We should go to the Bright Queen, right?

362
00:15:30.218 --> 00:15:32.725
TRAVIS: Yeah, on our time, we make our way to the Dynasty.

363
00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:33.558
MARISHA: Oh.

364
00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.714
MATT: Yeah, I think he had sent you to the Dynasty

365
00:15:35.714 --> 00:15:37.635
to check into this, and then return to him

366
00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:39.735
once you had informed him of what the decision was.

367
00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:42.495
ASHLEY: Dude, add a couple months to that.

368
00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:44.234
LAURA: Oof.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

369
00:15:44.234 --> 00:15:46.218
ASHLEY: Why I never know what the fuck is going on.

370
00:15:46.218 --> 00:15:47.495
(laughter)

371
00:15:47.495 --> 00:15:48.486
TRAVIS: You get hit in the head a lot.

372
00:15:48.486 --> 00:15:50.314
TALIESIN: It's almost like a normal D&amp;D game.

373
00:15:50.314 --> 00:15:53.238
SAM: We were wasting two days of time here in Rexxentrum.

374
00:15:53.238 --> 00:15:55.021
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: For reasons?

375
00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:56.936
TRAVIS: We're making a chalice for--

376
00:15:56.936 --> 00:15:58.746
LAURA: Making a chalice.
SAM: That's it.

377
00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:01.098
ASHLEY: I have something that I'm going to pick up

378
00:16:01.098 --> 00:16:02.501
at the store as well.

379
00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:03.334
SAM: Oh.

380
00:16:03.334 --> 00:16:05.492
Well, should we go? Is it day three now?

381
00:16:05.492 --> 00:16:07.044
Should we go pick up these items?

382
00:16:07.044 --> 00:16:08.726
TRAVIS: No, it's day two.

383
00:16:08.726 --> 00:16:09.854
SAM: I mean, like, are they ready?

384
00:16:09.854 --> 00:16:10.821
MARISHA: This is day two?

385
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:12.806
MATT: Since the order was put in, it's been a day.

386
00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.649
SAM: Oh, fucking shit.
LAURA: We got one more day.

387
00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:16.482
MARISHA: Should we go check in?

388
00:16:16.482 --> 00:16:19.508
Maybe they finish early and they just give that leeway time?

389
00:16:19.508 --> 00:16:21.883
TALIESIN: Do you need more arrows made or anything?

390
00:16:21.883 --> 00:16:24.058
Are you all right on your bolts?
SAM: I'm good, I'm good.

391
00:16:24.058 --> 00:16:25.760
TALIESIN: All right.

392
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.997
LAURA: Hmm.

393
00:16:26.997 --> 00:16:29.946
MARISHA: What are we going to tell the Bright Queen?

394
00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:32.543
LAURA: That's a good question.

395
00:16:32.543 --> 00:16:36.743
MARISHA: Because that is not the stolen beacon

396
00:16:36.743 --> 00:16:38.259
that we saw.

397
00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:39.445
Oh!

398
00:16:39.445 --> 00:16:42.323
SAM: I mean, they're all stolen, aren't they?

399
00:16:42.323 --> 00:16:43.733
MARISHA: Not necessarily.

400
00:16:43.733 --> 00:16:47.750
I haven't told you guys this, because I rushed back

401
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.015
from the library because we were going to go kick some ass.

402
00:16:51.015 --> 00:16:54.275
Okay, so, I did some crazy amount of research

403
00:16:54.275 --> 00:16:59.140
at the Cobalt Soul, and I looked
into that Pride's Call thing,

404
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.591
with the archeological dig where Trent was saying, yeah,

405
00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:07.948
that he dug up the thing.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

406
00:17:07.948 --> 00:17:09.752
MARISHA: That's actually legit.
LAURA: Oh.

407
00:17:09.752 --> 00:17:13.856
MARISHA: That's true, because the
Cobalt Soul has tapped into

408
00:17:13.856 --> 00:17:15.515
a lot of the archeological digs

409
00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:18.923
in order to try and keep them as neutral--

410
00:17:18.923 --> 00:17:23.898
or as Cobalt Soul-involved, realistically--

411
00:17:23.898 --> 00:17:25.506
as possible.

412
00:17:25.506 --> 00:17:30.291
So, they actually did uncover another beacon

413
00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:32.210
at Pride's Call.
LAURA: Oh, so they're not telling the truth.

414
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.208
MARISHA: No, they're definitely not.

415
00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:39.208
And that makes sense, because, yeah,

416
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.349
Nott, you went up to the beacon and you took a look at it.

417
00:17:43.349 --> 00:17:45.877
SAM: It seemed legit.

418
00:17:45.877 --> 00:17:47.231
MARISHA: But did it look different?

419
00:17:47.231 --> 00:17:48.596
TRAVIS: There's no way it is.

420
00:17:48.596 --> 00:17:50.507
It can't be.

421
00:17:50.507 --> 00:17:52.414
SAM: Did it look different, did it look different?

422
00:17:52.414 --> 00:17:55.485
LAURA: No, he said it looked the same. He said.

423
00:17:55.485 --> 00:18:00.485
MATT: It looked fairly similar to
the one that you had previously had.

424
00:18:00.544 --> 00:18:01.877
You weren't--

425
00:18:01.877 --> 00:18:03.778
You didn't have a basis of comparison side to side

426
00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:05.212
to see if they're the same.

427
00:18:05.212 --> 00:18:07.508
The handle work, I believe, on it

428
00:18:07.508 --> 00:18:09.485
looked different than the one that you were carrying.

429
00:18:09.485 --> 00:18:10.648
LAURA: Yeah, you said it was slightly smaller.

430
00:18:10.648 --> 00:18:12.052
MATT: Slightly smaller, but, like, overall,

431
00:18:12.052 --> 00:18:15.141
it had the same power, the same general shape.

432
00:18:15.141 --> 00:18:17.107
MARISHA: I mean, come on, the Bright Queen

433
00:18:17.107 --> 00:18:18.773
is going to be able to tell the difference

434
00:18:18.773 --> 00:18:22.213
between her stolen beacon and the not-stolen beacon.

435
00:18:22.213 --> 00:18:25.408
She can probably tap into its energy and some shit,

436
00:18:25.408 --> 00:18:28.396
and sense from afar, and read it,

437
00:18:28.396 --> 00:18:29.776
and be like, "That's not it!"

438
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.799
TRAVIS: Yeah, or as soon as she tries to tap into it,

439
00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:34.500
it explodes and kills all of them and us included.

440
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.998
MARISHA: I mean, that too.

441
00:18:35.998 --> 00:18:37.664
LIAM: That's all our fear, yeah? We'll have to

442
00:18:37.664 --> 00:18:39.484
examine it quite carefully.

443
00:18:39.484 --> 00:18:42.093
MARISHA: Well, from what I researched,

444
00:18:42.093 --> 00:18:46.656
the sinkhole at Pride's Call, it's from these old ruins

445
00:18:46.656 --> 00:18:49.939
from a pre-Calamity city called Shattengrad.

446
00:18:49.939 --> 00:18:50.792
MATT: Mm-hmm.

447
00:18:50.792 --> 00:18:52.890
MARISHA: Oh, fuck yes! Thank god.

448
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.621
TRAVIS: It's, like, a book over here.

449
00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:58.742
MATT: Wow, you went full
Ted S. Preston, Esquire there.

450
00:18:58.742 --> 00:19:00.980
(laughter)

451
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.542
MATT: Bill S. Preston, I think, Ted Theodore Logan.

452
00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:04.856
LIAM: I can't remember what we said.

453
00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:08.875
This is Dynasty side or over here? Over there?

454
00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:12.440
MARISHA: This is is near Kamordah.

455
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.823
LIAM: So one of these things--
MARISHA: Pride's Call is a dwarven city.

456
00:19:14.823 --> 00:19:18.373
LIAM: -- was dug up in an archeological dig?

457
00:19:18.373 --> 00:19:19.323
MARISHA: Yeah.

458
00:19:19.323 --> 00:19:21.445
MATT: Supposedly there had been two

459
00:19:21.445 --> 00:19:23.482
that were taken from the Dynasty.

460
00:19:23.482 --> 00:19:24.315
LIAM: Right.

461
00:19:24.315 --> 00:19:26.497
MATT: One of them you returned, the other they're saying

462
00:19:26.497 --> 00:19:29.417
they're willing to return, and she's uncovered that there is

463
00:19:29.417 --> 00:19:31.393
a new one that has been recovered

464
00:19:31.393 --> 00:19:35.196
by a dig here on the Empire side.

465
00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:37.242
MARISHA: Yeah, so Shattengrad, they were, like,

466
00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:41.167
super into arcane weaponry, and that's a lot of the stuff

467
00:19:41.167 --> 00:19:43.630
that they've uncovered in this archeological dig,

468
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.038
and this was uncovered a couple weeks ago

469
00:19:48.038 --> 00:19:49.107
or something, isn't that what you said?

470
00:19:49.107 --> 00:19:50.823
SAM: The one that we were shown?
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah.

471
00:19:50.823 --> 00:19:52.606
LAURA: So there's two!

472
00:19:52.606 --> 00:19:55.269
SAM: Where's the other one?
MARISHA: There's now a third one: the one we recovered,

473
00:19:55.269 --> 00:19:58.025
the one that's missing, and now this one.

474
00:19:58.025 --> 00:20:00.571
SAM: But we don't know where the third one is.
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: No.

475
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:03.973
SAM: It could be in Pride Rock,
whatever it's called. Pride's Call.

476
00:20:03.973 --> 00:20:05.848
LAURA: No, because they got the one from Pride's Call.

477
00:20:05.848 --> 00:20:06.806
MARISHA: Yeah.

478
00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:11.122
TALIESIN: I will say, I was paying attention to that guy,

479
00:20:11.122 --> 00:20:14.094
and he was telling the truth.

480
00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:15.753
TRAVIS: Trent Ikithon was telling the truth?

481
00:20:15.753 --> 00:20:18.266
TALIESIN: <i>Very</i> carefully.

482
00:20:18.266 --> 00:20:20.497
That was someone who was really thinking about

483
00:20:20.497 --> 00:20:23.997
everything that they were putting forward.

484
00:20:25.654 --> 00:20:27.749
There was nothing idle about that guy.

485
00:20:27.749 --> 00:20:32.749
MARISHA: So far, all of my research has told us that

486
00:20:33.302 --> 00:20:35.826
what Caduceus is saying is correct.

487
00:20:35.826 --> 00:20:38.086
ASHLEY: And there are three that we know of.

488
00:20:38.086 --> 00:20:39.293
LAURA: There's probably more.

489
00:20:39.293 --> 00:20:41.446
MARISHA: There's probably more, based on

490
00:20:41.446 --> 00:20:43.844
what I could recover that far.

491
00:20:43.844 --> 00:20:47.114
LIAM: Also, the fact that one of them was recovered here,

492
00:20:47.114 --> 00:20:48.818
in the Empire, says something about

493
00:20:48.818 --> 00:20:51.427
the nature of these things, if they predate the Calamity,

494
00:20:51.427 --> 00:20:53.097
is what we have uncovered?

495
00:20:53.097 --> 00:20:55.033
MATT: From what you've researched in the religion

496
00:20:55.033 --> 00:20:58.956
and the Luxon's presence, they predate the pantheon.

497
00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:00.307
LAURA: Whoa!

498
00:21:00.307 --> 00:21:04.558
LIAM: So they are not something that are, you know,

499
00:21:04.558 --> 00:21:08.137
it's the Dynasty's bag, but these things are not

500
00:21:08.137 --> 00:21:09.314
exclusive, right.

501
00:21:09.314 --> 00:21:12.582
It's not something that they, you know, forged or created,

502
00:21:12.582 --> 00:21:15.069
it's something that they--
MARISHA and LIAM: Found.

503
00:21:15.069 --> 00:21:18.277
MARISHA: And more are still being found.
LIAM: And embraced.

504
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:19.110
MARISHA: Yeah.

505
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.083
LAURA: It's like, maybe the earth grows them.

506
00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.064
MARISHA: Maybe.

507
00:21:23.064 --> 00:21:24.898
TRAVIS: Look, I don't think we try and knock it all out

508
00:21:24.898 --> 00:21:26.821
in one trip, I mean, I think we need to go

509
00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:29.351
and obviously share the information,

510
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:32.516
because she has a bunch of powerful fucking mages

511
00:21:32.516 --> 00:21:34.218
who will make sure we're telling the truth, right?

512
00:21:34.218 --> 00:21:36.865
We got that impression the last time.

513
00:21:36.865 --> 00:21:38.888
But I think we share, she probably looks at us

514
00:21:38.888 --> 00:21:41.953
like we're crazy, we tell her to believe us,

515
00:21:41.953 --> 00:21:43.609
and we go from there.

516
00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:45.485
MARISHA: We tell her about the one that was uncovered?

517
00:21:45.485 --> 00:21:47.543
TRAVIS: Yeah, and then we probably get locked up,

518
00:21:47.543 --> 00:21:48.863
and then they let us out and are like,

519
00:21:48.863 --> 00:21:49.940
"Are you sure you're telling the truth?"

520
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.564
We're like yes, and they lock us up again,

521
00:21:51.564 --> 00:21:53.250
and then they let us back out, and she's like,

522
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.962
"Are you sure, have you had time to think about this?"

523
00:21:54.962 --> 00:21:57.700
And we're like, no, yeah, we're telling the truth.

524
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.840
LIAM: Many things, I mean, we are all worried about

525
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.324
the idea that this is, you know, an ambush of some sort

526
00:22:03.324 --> 00:22:05.256
and we've tried to mitigate that by putting it

527
00:22:05.256 --> 00:22:09.151
in a neutral location, but we obviously

528
00:22:09.151 --> 00:22:10.445
need to be on guard about this.

529
00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:12.447
A question I have, I don't know the answer to yet,

530
00:22:12.447 --> 00:22:16.338
is whether we are going to be completely honest

531
00:22:16.338 --> 00:22:18.073
about that fact.

532
00:22:18.073 --> 00:22:20.595
MARISHA: Well, I think that's my ultimate question.

533
00:22:20.595 --> 00:22:22.748
Fjord is saying, yeah, you mean to the Bright Queen?

534
00:22:22.748 --> 00:22:23.656
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

535
00:22:23.656 --> 00:22:26.522
MARISHA: Yeah, Fjord's saying--
you're talking about which part?

536
00:22:26.522 --> 00:22:30.363
LIAM: Well, I would like to

537
00:22:30.363 --> 00:22:31.946
ease tensions,

538
00:22:31.946 --> 00:22:35.538
and part of me feels like the best thing to do

539
00:22:35.538 --> 00:22:37.233
is to be completely forthright with her,

540
00:22:37.233 --> 00:22:41.228
but that hardly seems like it would broker a peace.

541
00:22:42.337 --> 00:22:45.480
TRAVIS: No, you're right. I don't even know if--

542
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.342
LIAM: It might ingratiate us to her, but that does nothing

543
00:22:48.342 --> 00:22:49.740
for the conflict.

544
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.401
TRAVIS: I mean, I suppose it furthers the conversation,

545
00:22:52.401 --> 00:22:54.167
which I think is the part I'm most interested in.

546
00:22:54.167 --> 00:22:57.818
It doesn't seem like they are speaking at all, yes?

547
00:22:57.818 --> 00:23:00.245
Dynasty doesn't trust Empire, Empire doesn't trust Dynasty,

548
00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:03.175
and they're not talking, they're just fighting.

549
00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:04.791
So maybe at least the conversation,

550
00:23:04.791 --> 00:23:06.864
if we can bring them to the same place,

551
00:23:06.864 --> 00:23:09.688
bomb in tow or not,

552
00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:12.229
maybe at least a dialogue could happen?

553
00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:13.588
I mean, they kind of work together,

554
00:23:13.588 --> 00:23:15.901
especially with evidence of larger things afoot.

555
00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:17.684
I mean, if they knew that Tharizdun was out there,

556
00:23:17.684 --> 00:23:20.409
the Chained Oblivion had, you know,

557
00:23:20.409 --> 00:23:22.768
shackles in the Empire, I'm sure there's one in the Dynasty

558
00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.355
and all these other places. I mean,

559
00:23:24.355 --> 00:23:26.237
we need to find a way to put petty shit,

560
00:23:26.237 --> 00:23:29.619
you know, continental shit, but petty shit aside.

561
00:23:29.619 --> 00:23:32.869
MATT: Make a history check, Beauregard?

562
00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.486
MARISHA: All right, all right, it's fine.

563
00:23:38.486 --> 00:23:39.319
18.

564
00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:41.040
MATT: 18.

565
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.415
It doesn't come up often, but from more of just

566
00:23:43.415 --> 00:23:46.708
your passing knowledge and study that you recall

567
00:23:46.708 --> 00:23:50.537
on terms of warfare and such, even through conflict,

568
00:23:50.537 --> 00:23:52.377
it's not uncommon for there to be emissaries

569
00:23:52.377 --> 00:23:56.552
that do meet at times to attempt to

570
00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:02.149
weirdly work out aspects after battles,

571
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:04.821
or see if there are points that can be discussed

572
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:06.489
or tension can be loosened.

573
00:24:06.489 --> 00:24:10.111
That's not always the case,
especially if tensions are very high.

574
00:24:10.111 --> 00:24:11.961
You don't know if that's the case here.

575
00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:13.825
You do know that how this was presented to you

576
00:24:13.825 --> 00:24:15.962
is not because there hasn't been communication,

577
00:24:15.962 --> 00:24:18.486
but because of the relationship you have

578
00:24:18.486 --> 00:24:21.691
with the Bright Queen, the king believes

579
00:24:21.691 --> 00:24:23.733
that you might have a better chance

580
00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:26.819
of bringing it to a serious parley

581
00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:29.869
as opposed to just a conversation between emissaries.

582
00:24:29.869 --> 00:24:32.662
TRAVIS: Send in your seconds,
see if they can set the record straight.

583
00:24:32.662 --> 00:24:34.983
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Kind of. I relay all that.

584
00:24:34.983 --> 00:24:39.120
LIAM: But Da'leth was sweating in that room.

585
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.461
He was on edge.

586
00:24:42.738 --> 00:24:45.866
Nothing should be taken at face value.

587
00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:49.224
TALIESIN: Does it seem reasonable to,

588
00:24:49.224 --> 00:24:52.807
at the very least, air our--

589
00:24:52.807 --> 00:24:57.481
I don't want to say concerns, necessarily-- but our

590
00:24:57.481 --> 00:25:00.854
just say what we know, say that we don't know

591
00:25:00.854 --> 00:25:02.239
if there's more that we don't know,

592
00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:06.519
but it's worth a cautious optimism?

593
00:25:06.519 --> 00:25:07.934
LIAM: I think so.

594
00:25:07.934 --> 00:25:08.767
MARISHA: I think so, too.

595
00:25:08.767 --> 00:25:10.743
LIAM: It's a low, low possibility of success,

596
00:25:10.743 --> 00:25:12.534
but I think we go into this

597
00:25:14.442 --> 00:25:17.278
and be honest with her,

598
00:25:17.278 --> 00:25:20.473
even about our doubts and suspicions

599
00:25:20.473 --> 00:25:24.360
of the people that we are representing.

600
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.991
And forthright with our hope that,

601
00:25:27.991 --> 00:25:32.466
despite possible subterfuge, that there could be

602
00:25:32.466 --> 00:25:36.816
positive benefit gained here and it could be a start.

603
00:25:36.816 --> 00:25:41.809
We also need to get our hands on the delivery,

604
00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:44.967
and do our best to inspect it.

605
00:25:46.215 --> 00:25:48.056
MARISHA: I think that's one of our--

606
00:25:48.956 --> 00:25:51.539
I mean, they already showed it to us once.

607
00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:56.098
Do you think Trent would let us see it again?
SAM: Should we go steal it?

608
00:25:56.098 --> 00:25:57.123
We're going to go steal it?

609
00:25:57.123 --> 00:25:57.956
LAURA: I mean, we can go steal it.

610
00:25:57.956 --> 00:25:59.836
Me and Nott can do that.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

611
00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:01.290
That's what you're pulling out of all this?

612
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.387
The most chaotic possible thing?

613
00:26:04.387 --> 00:26:06.970
SAM: Well, that's what we do best.

614
00:26:08.189 --> 00:26:09.056
LAURA: Steal things.

615
00:26:09.056 --> 00:26:11.169
SAM: Steal things and solve mysteries.

616
00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:12.452
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

617
00:26:12.452 --> 00:26:14.931
LIAM: Get in and out of the house without a trace.

618
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:16.120
No lives taken.

619
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.711
LAURA: No lives taken, no holes in the floors,

620
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:23.222
no things on fire, nothing.

621
00:26:23.222 --> 00:26:26.104
SAM: Yeah, no, we're fine, we're good.

622
00:26:26.104 --> 00:26:27.225
TRAVIS: We have time.

623
00:26:27.225 --> 00:26:28.840
We'll pick up the items here, we can also pick up

624
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.531
your bracers in Xhorhas, we can talk to the Bright Queen,

625
00:26:32.531 --> 00:26:36.117
and then figure out next steps before

626
00:26:36.117 --> 00:26:38.662
your event is coming up, is it not?

627
00:26:38.662 --> 00:26:41.253
LAURA: Traveler Con 3000.

628
00:26:41.253 --> 00:26:43.010
TRAVIS: It has a number?
MARISHA: When did 3000 get involved?

629
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.000
That's new, right?
SAM: We're not even in the one thousands here.

630
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.303
LAURA: It's extra special.

631
00:26:47.303 --> 00:26:49.554
SAM: Oh, 836.

632
00:26:49.554 --> 00:26:50.882
LAURA: Soon.

633
00:26:50.882 --> 00:26:53.303
ASHLEY: Is it the 3000th one?

634
00:26:53.303 --> 00:26:54.136
TRAVIS: Yeah.

635
00:26:55.067 --> 00:26:58.464
LAURA: 3000 is just so you guys know how cool it is.

636
00:26:58.464 --> 00:27:00.717
TRAVIS: Oh, it's, like, a hype number.

637
00:27:00.717 --> 00:27:03.491
SAM: It's like Andre 3000.

638
00:27:03.491 --> 00:27:04.866
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Got it.

639
00:27:04.866 --> 00:27:07.652
ASHLEY: That does make it sound so much more cool.

640
00:27:07.652 --> 00:27:09.195
LAURA: Right?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

641
00:27:09.195 --> 00:27:12.592
TRAVIS: Is it the third Traveler Con, or like the 10th?

642
00:27:12.592 --> 00:27:15.068
MARISHA: Yeah, do you guys have Roman numerals?

643
00:27:15.068 --> 00:27:17.811
LAURA: As far as I know, I mean, this is the first time

644
00:27:17.811 --> 00:27:19.648
we've ever done this.

645
00:27:19.648 --> 00:27:21.885
TRAVIS: The inaugural?

646
00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:25.473
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn't even know

647
00:27:25.473 --> 00:27:28.532
that a lot of other people really knew about him,

648
00:27:28.532 --> 00:27:33.265
outside of me until we were traveling around and stuff.

649
00:27:33.265 --> 00:27:34.954
TRAVIS: Oh right, your pamphlets, yeah.

650
00:27:34.954 --> 00:27:36.710
MARISHA: Who's going to do the keynote speech?

651
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:37.761
LAURA: Me!

652
00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:41.204
I mean, yeah, I'm the most special follower they have.

653
00:27:41.204 --> 00:27:44.336
SAM: Do you know how many
roughly you can expect at Traveler Con?

654
00:27:44.336 --> 00:27:47.705
Is it like, 50, 100, 200?
LAURA: Well, how big is the volcano?

655
00:27:47.705 --> 00:27:49.524
Because we have to fit inside of it.

656
00:27:49.524 --> 00:27:50.357
TRAVIS: Pretty big.

657
00:27:50.357 --> 00:27:53.068
SAM: No, I know the maximum, but what if we show up

658
00:27:53.068 --> 00:27:56.418
and there's only, like, eight people there?

659
00:27:58.454 --> 00:28:01.431
LAURA: Well, there's definitely going to be at least eight.

660
00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:03.493
TRAVIS: It's not an active volcano that you have to be

661
00:28:03.493 --> 00:28:04.835
inside of, right?

662
00:28:04.835 --> 00:28:06.752
A dormant volcano is still all right?

663
00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:10.365
LAURA: I don't know much about this volcano, specifically.

664
00:28:10.365 --> 00:28:13.614
LIAM: But your patron has not given you a sense of--

665
00:28:13.614 --> 00:28:16.479
LAURA: My <i>god</i>, you mean?

666
00:28:16.479 --> 00:28:18.107
MARISHA: Patron means god.

667
00:28:18.107 --> 00:28:20.292
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was just
a person that gave you money.

668
00:28:20.292 --> 00:28:22.522
SAM: You thought he was patronizing you.

669
00:28:22.522 --> 00:28:24.344
MARISHA: I mean, that could also, you know.

670
00:28:24.344 --> 00:28:26.124
TALIESIN: I thought I was confused, now I'm really confused.

671
00:28:26.124 --> 00:28:28.074
MARISHA: Get context.
LAURA: What about him?

672
00:28:28.074 --> 00:28:31.712
LIAM: Has not given you a sense of how many more?

673
00:28:31.712 --> 00:28:34.417
You know so many things through him,

674
00:28:34.417 --> 00:28:36.736
he gives you such fantastical abilities.

675
00:28:36.736 --> 00:28:37.760
LAURA: Yeah.

676
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.163
LIAM: Has he imparted what to expect, or?

677
00:28:41.163 --> 00:28:44.821
LAURA: He said that--

678
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:46.471
no, he hasn't told me much about it.

679
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:47.928
SAM: But gods are mysterious.

680
00:28:47.928 --> 00:28:51.490
LAURA: But he said he-- like, I helped him choose

681
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.695
where it's going to be, you guys.

682
00:28:53.695 --> 00:28:55.172
SAM: That's a very important position.

683
00:28:55.172 --> 00:28:58.751
LAURA: I mean, I'm basically his right-hand man.

684
00:28:58.751 --> 00:29:00.766
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

685
00:29:00.766 --> 00:29:04.280
We have to show up, I mean, you're essentially the--

686
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.107
LAURA: Obviously, which reminds me, I think I need to talk

687
00:29:06.107 --> 00:29:09.868
to Orly or something, because we need a boat there, a ship.

688
00:29:09.868 --> 00:29:13.551
TRAVIS: Like a normal ship, like the
Balleater, or a larger ship?

689
00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:15.334
LAURA: Well, it's got to fit us.

690
00:29:15.334 --> 00:29:16.330
SAM: Just for us.
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

691
00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.760
LAURA: I don't know how the other people are going to get--

692
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.959
oh god, should I be organizing transportation

693
00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:22.046
for other people?

694
00:29:22.046 --> 00:29:24.506
SAM: If he didn't tell you to do that, then no.

695
00:29:25.481 --> 00:29:28.040
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my notebook and make a note

696
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.031
to ask the Traveler later.

697
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:32.643
MARISHA: Has he given you a per diem?

698
00:29:32.643 --> 00:29:34.596
Or some sort of petty cash system?

699
00:29:34.596 --> 00:29:35.907
I feel like that would be useful as well.

700
00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:37.129
LAURA: To, like, decorate and stuff?

701
00:29:37.129 --> 00:29:37.980
MARISHA: Yeah, absolutely.

702
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.574
SAM: Well, if you don't know your duties, I mean,

703
00:29:39.574 --> 00:29:42.981
you might be responsible for decor, flowers.

704
00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:46.250
LAURA: I'm definitely going to
write a speech, just to be sure!

705
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.894
Because I'm probably going to have to make--

706
00:29:47.894 --> 00:29:50.415
TRAVIS: Lanyards, you know, like, special badges?

707
00:29:50.415 --> 00:29:51.805
LAURA: There's so many things that I have to do.

708
00:29:51.805 --> 00:29:53.926
TRAVIS: Sunday only, nobody wants those, but I mean.

709
00:29:53.926 --> 00:29:57.671
ASHLEY: What happens at a Con 3000?

710
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:01.500
Do people come and speak or do special things?

711
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.431
LAURA: People come, and they'll probably,

712
00:30:04.431 --> 00:30:06.098
they'll be like, "Oh my god, Jester,

713
00:30:06.098 --> 00:30:08.262
"we've heard so much about you,

714
00:30:08.262 --> 00:30:11.573
"because Traveler talks about you all the time and stuff,"

715
00:30:11.573 --> 00:30:13.558
so they'll probably be really excited.

716
00:30:13.558 --> 00:30:16.971
ASHLEY: Is it like, food and events?

717
00:30:16.971 --> 00:30:18.428
LAURA: I don't know for sure.

718
00:30:18.428 --> 00:30:20.347
I think we all will get together,

719
00:30:20.347 --> 00:30:22.395
and then we'll be like, "Oh my god,

720
00:30:22.395 --> 00:30:25.113
"let's all talk about how great the Traveler is!"

721
00:30:25.113 --> 00:30:28.859
And outside of that, I don't really know what to expect.

722
00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:30.023
TRAVIS: What if they bring weapons?

723
00:30:30.023 --> 00:30:32.454
Do they get the little orange markers on them

724
00:30:32.454 --> 00:30:35.484
to show that, you know, they're not dangerous, or--

725
00:30:35.484 --> 00:30:36.522
ASHLEY: Peace tie?

726
00:30:36.522 --> 00:30:38.929
TRAVIS: Yeah, zip tie them to the people's belts?

727
00:30:38.929 --> 00:30:40.675
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.

728
00:30:40.675 --> 00:30:42.258
Maybe I should get some zip ties.

729
00:30:42.258 --> 00:30:43.794
LIAM: So many questions.

730
00:30:43.794 --> 00:30:46.059
LAURA: So many, I should really talk to the Traveler

731
00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:47.865
about all of this.
LIAM: Maybe it's a

732
00:30:47.865 --> 00:30:49.875
leap of faith he's expecting you to take.

733
00:30:49.875 --> 00:30:51.119
LAURA: (gasps)

734
00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:56.119
ASHLEY: Maybe you should make a
performance with your bone flute.

735
00:30:56.365 --> 00:30:57.742
SAM: Mm-hmm.

736
00:30:57.742 --> 00:30:59.107
LAURA: That'd be so good.

737
00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:01.018
TALIESIN: I mean, I could do that. I was saving that

738
00:31:01.018 --> 00:31:02.274
for something else, but we could--

739
00:31:02.274 --> 00:31:04.179
LAURA: Maybe we should practice together and then

740
00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:05.341
we could do it together!

741
00:31:05.341 --> 00:31:07.743
TALIESIN: There's going to be a harp, so that'll be okay.

742
00:31:07.743 --> 00:31:08.927
LAURA: -- then just plays the flute.

743
00:31:08.927 --> 00:31:10.693
ASHLEY: I think we should practice a

744
00:31:10.693 --> 00:31:12.643
song together, maybe.
LAURA: I could play piano.

745
00:31:12.643 --> 00:31:14.019
I have to get a piano there.

746
00:31:14.019 --> 00:31:15.661
ASHLEY: We could provide the music.

747
00:31:15.661 --> 00:31:18.475
MARISHA: You're going to get a piano into a volcano?

748
00:31:18.475 --> 00:31:19.988
LAURA: Maybe I can paint a piano as soon as we get

749
00:31:19.988 --> 00:31:20.931
to the volcano!

750
00:31:20.931 --> 00:31:23.321
SAM: Oh, like, paint it and it will appear.

751
00:31:23.321 --> 00:31:24.625
TALIESIN: Save a lot in shipping.

752
00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:28.854
LIAM: Able to conjure up a lollipop; can you make a piano?

753
00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:30.902
LAURA: That's a really good question.

754
00:31:30.902 --> 00:31:31.900
I've never tried.

755
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.970
SAM: This'll be the first performance

756
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.813
of Yasha and the Orphan Makers.
LAURA: Should I try?

757
00:31:35.813 --> 00:31:36.650
MARISHA: Yeah.

758
00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.799
Maybe you guys could play Jester out

759
00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:42.518
as she comes out to do her keynote speech.

760
00:31:42.518 --> 00:31:46.500
ASHLEY: Yes, we could, you know, give you,

761
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.354
what do they call those?

762
00:31:48.354 --> 00:31:49.712
Barking?

763
00:31:49.712 --> 00:31:50.717
TALIESIN: A patron.

764
00:31:50.717 --> 00:31:55.679
ASHLEY: No, like when someone is
coming into a room and you say--

765
00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.103
SAM: Oh, like--
ASHLEY: Barking, a barking.

766
00:31:57.103 --> 00:31:59.387
A barker.
TRAVIS: A-barking.

767
00:31:59.387 --> 00:32:01.754
(laughter)

768
00:32:02.673 --> 00:32:03.506
LAURA: Yeah!

769
00:32:03.506 --> 00:32:04.727
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

770
00:32:04.727 --> 00:32:08.290
We can play a song for you to come into the room

771
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.958
to meet the Traveler and everyone.

772
00:32:09.958 --> 00:32:11.082
TRAVIS: A-barking.

773
00:32:11.082 --> 00:32:11.915
ASHLEY: A barking.

774
00:32:11.915 --> 00:32:14.417
LIAM: (howling)

775
00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:17.985
MARISHA: We got really distracted from our plans

776
00:32:17.985 --> 00:32:20.910
of saving the world.
LAURA: I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon,

777
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.505
and I'm going to conjure a piano.

778
00:32:23.505 --> 00:32:24.630
MATT: All right.

779
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.742
As you focus, what level you cast it as?

780
00:32:26.742 --> 00:32:29.417
LAURA: Second.
MATT: Second level.

781
00:32:29.417 --> 00:32:32.573
This pinkish energy swirls and sparkles

782
00:32:32.573 --> 00:32:35.673
into this little toy piano,

783
00:32:35.673 --> 00:32:37.981
that (plinking) in the air.

784
00:32:37.981 --> 00:32:39.623
LAURA: Like, this much?

785
00:32:39.623 --> 00:32:40.796
MATT: It's about that big.

786
00:32:40.796 --> 00:32:41.874
TALIESIN: Casio SJ1 style.

787
00:32:41.874 --> 00:32:42.940
ASHLEY: What color?

788
00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.314
LIAM: Pink, pink.
LAURA: Pink.

789
00:32:44.314 --> 00:32:45.872
Pinkish-purple.

790
00:32:45.872 --> 00:32:47.534
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

791
00:32:47.534 --> 00:32:50.871
LAURA: Okay, I play it.

792
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:52.579
MATT: It's kind of weird, immaterial.

793
00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:54.946
LAURA: ♪ (slightly off-key "Chopsticks") ♪

794
00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:57.714
MATT: It's not the best sound, it's not tuned well.

795
00:32:57.714 --> 00:33:01.248
LAURA: ♪ (slightly off-key "Chopsticks") ♪

796
00:33:02.118 --> 00:33:04.196
MATT: Make a performance check.

797
00:33:04.196 --> 00:33:05.078
LIAM: Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

798
00:33:05.078 --> 00:33:07.536
TRAVIS: That and the skull whistle's
going to be a fucking thing.

799
00:33:07.536 --> 00:33:10.299
LAURA: Oh, it's going to sound so good with this.

800
00:33:10.299 --> 00:33:11.132
Ooh!

801
00:33:12.307 --> 00:33:13.645
18.

802
00:33:13.645 --> 00:33:16.074
MATT: You know, as opposed to being

803
00:33:16.074 --> 00:33:18.899
a nightmarish discordant toy piano

804
00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:20.653
being tussled with by a kid in the back

805
00:33:20.653 --> 00:33:23.348
of the antique store, it's more like

806
00:33:23.348 --> 00:33:26.409
your cute pixie manic girl on YouTube

807
00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:29.533
who decided, "Eh, not an uke today, toy piano."

808
00:33:29.533 --> 00:33:30.921
(laughter)

809
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:32.279
TALIESIN: It's got a charm.

810
00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:33.936
ASHLEY: It looks like there are buttons, too,

811
00:33:33.936 --> 00:33:37.613
for, like, drum beats or something.

812
00:33:37.613 --> 00:33:39.679
SAM: (vocalizing generic synth beat)

813
00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:41.608
TRAVIS: I know we got sidetracked, but do you have like--

814
00:33:41.608 --> 00:33:42.832
SAM: No, did we?

815
00:33:42.832 --> 00:33:44.512
(laughter)

816
00:33:44.512 --> 00:33:47.171
TRAVIS: Like, do you have a goal, or a hope,

817
00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:48.937
a wish, coming out of this, that you'll--

818
00:33:48.937 --> 00:33:49.845
LAURA: I've got nothing.

819
00:33:49.845 --> 00:33:52.554
All I know is that he told me to be there,

820
00:33:52.554 --> 00:33:54.023
so I got to be there.

821
00:33:54.023 --> 00:33:56.231
SAM: You're a holy man now, Fjord,

822
00:33:56.231 --> 00:33:59.494
you understand that when your god asks you to go somewhere

823
00:33:59.494 --> 00:34:00.645
and do something for them--
LAURA: You just do it.

824
00:34:00.645 --> 00:34:01.786
SAM: You just do it.

825
00:34:01.786 --> 00:34:05.007
LAURA: As long as they're not a giant sea snake

826
00:34:05.007 --> 00:34:07.057
that's asking you to--

827
00:34:07.057 --> 00:34:08.857
SAM and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

828
00:34:08.857 --> 00:34:11.212
TRAVIS: I mean, we don't even know if it was a snea snake,

829
00:34:11.212 --> 00:34:13.196
all right?
LAURA: Snea snake?

830
00:34:13.196 --> 00:34:15.554
ASHLEY: What's a snea snake?
LIAM: Snea sake, 2020.

831
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:18.953
TRAVIS: It is a creature known--

832
00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:21.667
ASHLEY: Is a snea sake different from a sea snake?

833
00:34:21.667 --> 00:34:24.617
TRAVIS: It is, yeah. One is venomous, one is not.

834
00:34:24.617 --> 00:34:27.185
MARISHA: It's a sneature.
LIAM: Little bit like a snea stack.

835
00:34:27.185 --> 00:34:29.573
TRAVIS: And the other one has a sneeze on his face.

836
00:34:29.573 --> 00:34:31.266
SAM: Well, good night, everybody!

837
00:34:31.266 --> 00:34:32.502
(laughter)

838
00:34:32.502 --> 00:34:33.452
TRAVIS: Day two!

839
00:34:33.452 --> 00:34:35.083
SAM: Is it morning still?

840
00:34:35.083 --> 00:34:37.810
MARISHA: Was this morning, or are we
still talking in the hall?

841
00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.762
TALIESIN: It is now late evening.

842
00:34:39.762 --> 00:34:40.651
MARISHA: This was breakfast.

843
00:34:40.651 --> 00:34:41.857
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:34:41.857 --> 00:34:44.654
MATT: Imagine all that, but like, half-chewed food

845
00:34:44.654 --> 00:34:46.006
in half of the words.

846
00:34:46.006 --> 00:34:48.174
TRAVIS: We're waiting for a chalice,
we're waiting for a harp before we leave.

847
00:34:48.174 --> 00:34:50.726
SAM: We got to waste a fucking day
again, so what are we doing?

848
00:34:50.726 --> 00:34:52.323
MARISHA: Go talk to the Bright Queen.

849
00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:54.468
SAM: We can't. We have to wait a day.

850
00:34:54.468 --> 00:34:56.693
TRAVIS: We can say the day goes by.
SAM: A day passes.

851
00:34:56.693 --> 00:34:58.393
TRAVIS: Unless we want to do anything.

852
00:34:58.393 --> 00:35:00.552
SAM: The only place that we could possibly go

853
00:35:00.552 --> 00:35:02.790
is to visit Astrid.

854
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:03.882
LIAM: Why would we do that?

855
00:35:03.882 --> 00:35:05.305
LAURA: We haven't done it yet.

856
00:35:05.305 --> 00:35:06.315
We should do it.

857
00:35:06.315 --> 00:35:09.692
SAM: Or go to Pride's Rock and see what's--

858
00:35:09.692 --> 00:35:11.368
TRAVIS: Pride's Call.

859
00:35:11.368 --> 00:35:14.094
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and LIAM: That's far.

860
00:35:14.094 --> 00:35:15.891
SAM: Yeah, but we--
MARISHA: We'd have to bamf there.

861
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:16.724
SAM: We have teleport.

862
00:35:16.724 --> 00:35:18.237
LAURA: I think that's why we were taking the time.

863
00:35:18.237 --> 00:35:20.894
MARISHA: I don't know if he's got
a circle to go to Pride's Call.

864
00:35:20.894 --> 00:35:22.231
SAM: He can do all sorts of things.

865
00:35:22.231 --> 00:35:24.140
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to Pride's Call.
MARISHA: Wait, what?

866
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.433
No, wait, how?
LIAM: How?

867
00:35:26.433 --> 00:35:27.806
SAM: Can't you teleport us there?

868
00:35:27.806 --> 00:35:30.797
LAURA: No, he can't teleport us to a random place.

869
00:35:30.797 --> 00:35:33.656
TRAVIS: Can't Ludinus Da'leth or somebody--?

870
00:35:33.656 --> 00:35:36.990
TALIESIN: That feels possibly overcooked.

871
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.815
SAM: Well then, a day will go by.

872
00:35:39.815 --> 00:35:40.973
TALIESIN: Patron.

873
00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:45.373
MARISHA: Hang on, I could go
back to the library, I guess.

874
00:35:45.373 --> 00:35:46.460
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

875
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.293
SAM: What?

876
00:35:47.293 --> 00:35:48.432
TRAVIS: The big one?

877
00:35:48.432 --> 00:35:49.861
Just the Empire?

878
00:35:50.703 --> 00:35:51.920
TRAVIS: Give that over to Yasha.

879
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.137
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

880
00:35:54.657 --> 00:35:56.824
LIAM: We can only return here.

881
00:35:58.467 --> 00:36:00.431
And Da'leth is not, I don't think,

882
00:36:00.431 --> 00:36:02.261
going to send us to go sniffing about

883
00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:04.257
where they found one of these things.

884
00:36:04.257 --> 00:36:06.068
LAURA: Yeah, probably not.

885
00:36:06.068 --> 00:36:08.035
LIAM: And what are these things?

886
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:10.885
LAURA: Yeah, what are they?
Me and Caduceus were talking about it.

887
00:36:10.885 --> 00:36:14.927
They're either A, homegrown from the land,

888
00:36:14.927 --> 00:36:18.269
B, fell from the sky,

889
00:36:19.228 --> 00:36:23.078
C, made by somebody a long, long time ago,

890
00:36:23.078 --> 00:36:26.481
D, I think this is the best answer,

891
00:36:26.481 --> 00:36:28.169
they're poop of some kind.

892
00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:29.207
(laughter)

893
00:36:29.207 --> 00:36:32.746
Yes, but like, god poop, you know?

894
00:36:32.746 --> 00:36:35.193
Like sometimes, I'm sure the gods have to poop.

895
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:36.788
What if that's why they all look different?

896
00:36:36.788 --> 00:36:38.690
LIAM: I would not want to pass one of those stones.

897
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.207
LAURA: No, but gods are really big.

898
00:36:40.207 --> 00:36:42.341
TRAVIS: One day they had, like, a lot of meat,

899
00:36:42.341 --> 00:36:44.109
the other day, lots of veggies.

900
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:45.954
LAURA: Or, like, one is from, you know, like--

901
00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:48.082
TRAVIS: One day there were on a protein kick.

902
00:36:48.082 --> 00:36:48.948
LAURA: One is from Kord,

903
00:36:48.948 --> 00:36:52.599
and the little one is from Ioun.
SAM: DM, when I went up to the last one,

904
00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:55.024
were there little bits of corn in it?

905
00:36:55.024 --> 00:36:55.857
LIAM: Jesus.

906
00:36:55.857 --> 00:36:57.654
(Sam laughs)

907
00:36:57.654 --> 00:36:59.072
MATT: No.
SAM: Great.

908
00:36:59.072 --> 00:37:00.420
I don't think it's poop.

909
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.591
LAURA: Well, it's an option.

910
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:04.123
TRAVIS: What do you mean fell from the sky?

911
00:37:04.123 --> 00:37:06.255
LAURA: I don't know, like,
they fell like meteors or something.

912
00:37:06.255 --> 00:37:09.510
LIAM: Well, bodies of material do, on occasion,

913
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.231
fall from the heavens.

914
00:37:11.231 --> 00:37:13.770
LAURA: I don't know how they
would get the handles, though.

915
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.945
LIAM: Well no, that's something
that the Dynasty has provided, I think.

916
00:37:17.945 --> 00:37:20.028
I've thought the very same thing,
that perhaps they're--

917
00:37:20.028 --> 00:37:22.441
LAURA: Oh, maybe they just come as the stone

918
00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:24.278
and then people have to make the handles

919
00:37:24.278 --> 00:37:26.424
so that when they touch them, the don't instantly get like,

920
00:37:26.424 --> 00:37:28.860
in, because when you touch it, you go in, right?

921
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.745
TRAVIS: So do you think we'd
learn something if we figure out

922
00:37:30.745 --> 00:37:32.756
like, how deep into the earth they had to go

923
00:37:32.756 --> 00:37:35.126
to retrieve this thing, or if it was only like,

924
00:37:35.126 --> 00:37:36.579
just underneath the surface?

925
00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:38.281
TALIESIN: I have a weird thought.

926
00:37:38.281 --> 00:37:40.090
TRAVIS: That sounds normal.

927
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.414
TALIESIN: This is a little more serious.

928
00:37:43.414 --> 00:37:45.899
So if they found this thing underground,

929
00:37:45.899 --> 00:37:47.717
and it's been there for a while,

930
00:37:47.717 --> 00:37:52.717
and the Bright Queen said that
they use this as sort of a...

931
00:37:52.752 --> 00:37:57.670
like, I don't know, like, a place for souls to reside,

932
00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:01.506
I guess, or some such--
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

933
00:38:01.506 --> 00:38:04.164
TALIESIN: So what's in this one?

934
00:38:04.164 --> 00:38:05.530
LAURA: Are there people in there?

935
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.079
MARISHA: What's in the uncovered beacon?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

936
00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:09.677
ASHLEY: I actually--
LIAM: Oh, I see your point.

937
00:38:09.677 --> 00:38:11.193
SAM: Oh, it's like fresh.

938
00:38:11.193 --> 00:38:13.298
TALIESIN: It's like old.

939
00:38:13.298 --> 00:38:17.580
ASHLEY: Do they all do the same thing?

940
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.829
LAURA: I think so?

941
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:19.668
TALIESIN: Pretty sure.

942
00:38:19.668 --> 00:38:21.153
LAURA: I mean, I don't know.

943
00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:22.848
SAM: There's one way to find out.

944
00:38:22.848 --> 00:38:24.291
LAURA: What if, you guys--

945
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:25.778
SAM: We have a day, we could just sneak in

946
00:38:25.778 --> 00:38:28.655
and do some experiments on it, and then sneak out.

947
00:38:28.655 --> 00:38:31.257
TRAVIS: Without getting killed.
MARISHA: Did you see that place?

948
00:38:31.257 --> 00:38:35.390
LAURA: What if Trent Ikithon was like,

949
00:38:36.443 --> 00:38:39.775
what if he stole souls from them?

950
00:38:39.775 --> 00:38:42.448
What if that's one of the bad things he was doing?

951
00:38:42.448 --> 00:38:46.180
TALIESIN: I'm not even sure he knows
that they're in there, really.

952
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.780
TRAVIS: I don't think he does.

953
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.494
LAURA: We should be talking quieter, then.

954
00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:53.843
LIAM: I think it's safe to assume that the Assembly,

955
00:38:53.843 --> 00:38:58.812
or at least Trent and Vess DeRogna,

956
00:38:58.812 --> 00:38:59.981
that's antiquities, correct?

957
00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:00.814
MATT: Correct.

958
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:04.852
LIAM: They would have done as much research

959
00:39:04.852 --> 00:39:06.007
and homework as possible.

960
00:39:06.007 --> 00:39:07.819
I think we should assume they know.

961
00:39:07.819 --> 00:39:08.968
MARISHA: Yeah.
(Ashley sneezes)

962
00:39:08.968 --> 00:39:09.801
LAURA: Bless you.

963
00:39:10.989 --> 00:39:12.360
The Traveler blesses you.

964
00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.696
TRAVIS: What do the two of you need to break in?

965
00:39:13.696 --> 00:39:15.747
I'm about this plan.

966
00:39:15.747 --> 00:39:17.130
SAM: I-- either--

967
00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:20.483
I want to either break in tomorrow,

968
00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:22.887
and just magically make it tomorrow,

969
00:39:22.887 --> 00:39:26.705
or go somewhere and break into something, and--

970
00:39:26.705 --> 00:39:27.836
TRAVIS: Anywhere.
TALIESIN: Anywhere.

971
00:39:27.836 --> 00:39:29.951
SAM: Well, I mean, thought we
needed to do some research--

972
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:31.465
LAURA: I mean, you already got some hats for us.

973
00:39:31.465 --> 00:39:33.460
They're really nice, by the way.

974
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.300
SAM: Dinky dinky dinky.

975
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.340
TALIESIN: That was very weird, considering
that she wasn't wearing a hat.

976
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.979
(laughter)

977
00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:43.105
TRAVIS: Just tugged on a horn.

978
00:39:43.105 --> 00:39:45.080
SAM: Eh.

979
00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.062
But we could go check out
that place, if you wanted to.

980
00:39:49.062 --> 00:39:50.844
MARISHA: They teleported us to that prison.

981
00:39:50.844 --> 00:39:52.570
SAM: Oh, that's right.
But he knows where it is.

982
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.081
No, you don't know where
it is, do you?

983
00:39:54.081 --> 00:39:55.805
LAURA: Do you know where it is?
SAM: Caleb?

984
00:39:55.805 --> 00:39:56.963
LIAM: Pride's--

985
00:39:56.963 --> 00:40:00.140
SAM: No, no, no, the place where they're holding the beacon.

986
00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.235
LIAM: I mean, I could--

987
00:40:02.235 --> 00:40:04.307
TRAVIS: The terrible, creepy-ass
place surrounded by iron gates.

988
00:40:04.307 --> 00:40:06.097
LIAM: I would think that I
could walk everybody there, but--

989
00:40:06.097 --> 00:40:08.014
MATT: Vergessen Sanitorium? You could.

990
00:40:09.013 --> 00:40:13.538
You know where it is based
on your training with Trent

991
00:40:13.538 --> 00:40:15.884
before you were placed there,
and then when you escaped it,

992
00:40:15.884 --> 00:40:18.763
you had to, on foot, head through
the woods southwards.

993
00:40:18.763 --> 00:40:21.477
MARISHA: How far is it?

994
00:40:21.477 --> 00:40:22.400
LIAM: How far?
MARISHA: I mean, you've walked it.

995
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.810
MATT: Flip the map and I'll show you.

996
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:24.700
LAURA: Oh.

997
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.735
SAM: It's map length, it's not
just like, in Rexxentrum.

998
00:40:28.735 --> 00:40:30.010
LAURA: No, it's outside.

999
00:40:31.531 --> 00:40:35.490
MATT: So, we have over here, we have...

1000
00:40:36.783 --> 00:40:39.741
LAURA: Oh, it's really far away from Rexxentrum?

1001
00:40:39.741 --> 00:40:42.200
MATT: Where's Rexxentrum?
LAURA: Rexxentrum's right there.

1002
00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.593
MATT: It's like right up the mountains here.

1003
00:40:43.593 --> 00:40:44.485
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1004
00:40:44.485 --> 00:40:46.270
MATT: It's in the Pearlbow Wilderness.

1005
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.903
So it's through the woods,
about a day and a half travel,

1006
00:40:49.903 --> 00:40:51.303
two days' travel.

1007
00:40:51.303 --> 00:40:52.745
LAURA: ♪ Into the woods ♪

1008
00:40:55.554 --> 00:40:57.374
LIAM: I do not think we should
try to break into there,

1009
00:40:57.374 --> 00:40:59.752
I had to kill a man to get out of it.

1010
00:40:59.752 --> 00:41:01.618
It will mess with our timeline for what we are

1011
00:41:01.618 --> 00:41:04.558
planning to do with the Bright Queen.

1012
00:41:05.841 --> 00:41:07.806
Doesn't seem like an opportune time, and

1013
00:41:07.806 --> 00:41:12.806
that place is as hard a nut as you'll find to crack.

1014
00:41:13.616 --> 00:41:16.857
SAM: Well then, let's take a mental health day,

1015
00:41:16.857 --> 00:41:19.120
and then tomorrow, we do stuff.

1016
00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:19.953
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1017
00:41:19.953 --> 00:41:22.864
MARISHA: Yeah, Caleb, if you want to go with me,

1018
00:41:22.864 --> 00:41:24.148
I don't know what you're up to today

1019
00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.687
or if you're going to be aloof again,

1020
00:41:25.687 --> 00:41:28.863
but I was halfway through some research,

1021
00:41:28.863 --> 00:41:31.085
but I was running out of time and didn't find much,

1022
00:41:31.085 --> 00:41:33.252
maybe you could help me.

1023
00:41:33.252 --> 00:41:35.572
LIAM: Yeah, of course, I went
to the library one time,

1024
00:41:35.572 --> 00:41:37.578
I will go with you twice.

1025
00:41:38.545 --> 00:41:39.743
MARISHA: Dope.

1026
00:41:39.743 --> 00:41:40.741
LIAM: Dope.

1027
00:41:40.741 --> 00:41:41.911
TRAVIS: I'm going to work on this beard,

1028
00:41:41.911 --> 00:41:43.543
I'm going to grow a beard today.

1029
00:41:43.543 --> 00:41:45.289
I'm going to grow a beard in.

1030
00:41:45.289 --> 00:41:46.312
Yep.

1031
00:41:46.312 --> 00:41:50.054
(laughter)

1032
00:41:50.054 --> 00:41:51.237
SAM: All right.
TRAVIS: It's a choice.

1033
00:41:51.237 --> 00:41:52.808
SAM: Sure.

1034
00:41:52.808 --> 00:41:54.592
Go for it.

1035
00:41:54.592 --> 00:41:56.917
ASHLEY: I'm going to go sit
outside again somewhere

1036
00:41:56.917 --> 00:42:00.396
and try to continue reading my book,

1037
00:42:00.396 --> 00:42:02.894
which I have 17 hours left.

1038
00:42:02.894 --> 00:42:04.004
MARISHA: How's it going, by the way?

1039
00:42:04.004 --> 00:42:05.400
How's that reading?

1040
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.143
ASHLEY: It's pretty good.

1041
00:42:08.143 --> 00:42:09.174
MARISHA: It's a page turner?

1042
00:42:09.174 --> 00:42:12.533
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's a little bit dense,

1043
00:42:12.533 --> 00:42:17.015
but I got to some parts that...

1044
00:42:17.015 --> 00:42:19.432
seemed kind of weird?

1045
00:42:20.274 --> 00:42:22.320
Like it was a little sexy.

1046
00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.676
LAURA: Really?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1047
00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:27.456
LAURA: Sounds interesting, I wonder--

1048
00:42:27.456 --> 00:42:29.957
ASHLEY: It was like, you know, talking about exercise,

1049
00:42:29.957 --> 00:42:34.360
and then it was like, other forms of exercise,

1050
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.885
and then there were these drawings.

1051
00:42:37.885 --> 00:42:41.387
It was a little strange, it was like--

1052
00:42:41.387 --> 00:42:42.743
TRAVIS: Were they, like, spotting each other?

1053
00:42:42.743 --> 00:42:45.369
Making sure their form was correct, or?

1054
00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:46.696
LAURA: Yeah, tell us all about it.

1055
00:42:46.696 --> 00:42:50.432
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was like, it was talking about,

1056
00:42:50.432 --> 00:42:52.809
you know, two people working out,

1057
00:42:52.809 --> 00:42:56.009
and then how they were getting very sweaty.

1058
00:42:56.009 --> 00:42:57.401
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1059
00:42:57.401 --> 00:43:01.238
ASHLEY: And then spotting each other, and then--

1060
00:43:01.238 --> 00:43:03.450
LAURA: Tell them the best part, though.

1061
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:04.412
ASHLEY: Well--

1062
00:43:04.412 --> 00:43:07.837
(laughter)

1063
00:43:09.518 --> 00:43:11.172
ASHLEY: I still have a lot more to read.

1064
00:43:11.172 --> 00:43:14.839
I stopped right at the part where

1065
00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:20.808
the guy was pulling off,

1066
00:43:20.808 --> 00:43:22.594
like, very tight pants.

1067
00:43:22.594 --> 00:43:24.028
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
00:43:24.028 --> 00:43:26.591
They were getting in the
way when he was squatting.

1069
00:43:26.591 --> 00:43:30.961
ASHLEY: When he was squatting,
and they kind of, they burst open.

1070
00:43:30.961 --> 00:43:33.575
LIAM: Are you talking about per<i>en</i>inum sunning?

1071
00:43:33.575 --> 00:43:35.691
ASHLEY: Say again?

1072
00:43:35.691 --> 00:43:36.982
LIAM: Per<i>en</i>ium.

1073
00:43:36.982 --> 00:43:39.424
SAM: Pere<i>ni</i>um?

1074
00:43:39.424 --> 00:43:40.957
ASHLEY: Puh- per<i>en</i>ium sunning?

1075
00:43:40.957 --> 00:43:42.904
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. I have read about this,
they do this in Nicodranas,

1076
00:43:42.904 --> 00:43:45.371
on the coast, I've read about it.
MARISHA: Yeah, I've read about this, yeah.

1077
00:43:45.371 --> 00:43:48.454
TRAVIS: What's a per<i>en</i>ium?
SAM: Is it peri<i>ne</i>um?

1078
00:43:48.454 --> 00:43:49.500
(Laura laughing)

1079
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.714
MARISHA: I read about it in this, yeah.

1080
00:43:51.714 --> 00:43:52.547
LIAM: Sunning.

1081
00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:54.099
MARISHA: You can read about it in this,

1082
00:43:54.099 --> 00:43:57.384
there's this elven woman named Gwyneth Paltrow,

1083
00:43:57.384 --> 00:43:59.711
you can read it about it on her blog.

1084
00:43:59.711 --> 00:44:01.485
SAM: It's your asshole.

1085
00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:03.258
TRAVIS: No, it's not.

1086
00:44:03.258 --> 00:44:05.176
LIAM: That is what that word means.

1087
00:44:05.176 --> 00:44:07.462
And then you put the sun on it, apparently.

1088
00:44:07.462 --> 00:44:09.409
SAM: It's supposed to make you feel really good.

1089
00:44:09.409 --> 00:44:11.495
LAURA: It's a thing they do in Nicodranas, for sure.

1090
00:44:11.495 --> 00:44:13.168
TRAVIS: They put sun on their buttholes?

1091
00:44:13.168 --> 00:44:14.679
SAM: They don't <i>put</i> it on, they just

1092
00:44:14.679 --> 00:44:17.304
expose their buttholes to the sun.

1093
00:44:17.304 --> 00:44:18.861
You can't <i>put</i> sun on your butthole.

1094
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:19.938
TRAVIS: That makes sense.

1095
00:44:19.938 --> 00:44:22.891
But that's such a strange position to achieve.

1096
00:44:22.891 --> 00:44:25.887
You get your butthole as high as possible,

1097
00:44:25.887 --> 00:44:27.718
and then expose it.

1098
00:44:27.718 --> 00:44:28.551
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1099
00:44:28.551 --> 00:44:30.616
MARISHA: Have you asked a cleric that question?

1100
00:44:30.616 --> 00:44:31.749
Just saying.

1101
00:44:31.749 --> 00:44:34.885
MATT: I mean, Pelor clerics have their own unique ways

1102
00:44:34.885 --> 00:44:37.253
of praying to the Dawnfather.

1103
00:44:37.253 --> 00:44:38.436
MARISHA: I object.

1104
00:44:38.436 --> 00:44:40.461
You absolutely <i>can</i> put sun on your butthole

1105
00:44:40.461 --> 00:44:42.474
in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

1106
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.699
MATT: Let me show my piety.

1107
00:44:44.699 --> 00:44:46.934
(laughter)

1108
00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:49.549
LIAM: It's yoga, that sounds like monk shit to me.

1109
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:51.464
ASHLEY: Yeah, it is interesting how the drawings

1110
00:44:51.464 --> 00:44:53.535
are so different, though, you know?

1111
00:44:53.535 --> 00:44:55.012
LAURA: Mm. Mm-hmm.

1112
00:44:55.012 --> 00:44:57.344
LIAM: Yeah, that's what that sunburst is right there.

1113
00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.619
TRAVIS: Oh, it's not a sun.

1114
00:44:59.619 --> 00:45:04.367
MARISHA: Wait. And that book helps with your intellect?

1115
00:45:04.367 --> 00:45:08.947
ASHLEY: Well no, it's for fitness, exercises and things.

1116
00:45:08.947 --> 00:45:12.132
But he has, like, a little bit of a tent in his pants here.

1117
00:45:12.132 --> 00:45:13.876
LAURA: I didn't think about, I mean,

1118
00:45:13.876 --> 00:45:17.584
I'm sure whoever was writing those steamy sections

1119
00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:20.046
didn't think about the fact that it would add

1120
00:45:20.046 --> 00:45:21.720
to your time of reading.

1121
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.086
ASHLEY: Well, I do think that, you know--
LAURA: But at least it gives a little--

1122
00:45:24.086 --> 00:45:26.128
ASHLEY: It is a form of exercise,

1123
00:45:26.128 --> 00:45:29.463
to have sexual relations as well.

1124
00:45:29.463 --> 00:45:32.468
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, it's a good exercise.
LIAM: Yeah, that is true.

1125
00:45:32.468 --> 00:45:34.131
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

1126
00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:35.065
ASHLEY: Anyway.

1127
00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:37.009
MATT: How many more hours do
you want to spend reading?

1128
00:45:37.009 --> 00:45:39.982
(laughter)

1129
00:45:39.982 --> 00:45:43.027
ASHLEY: Okay, 17 hours left.

1130
00:45:43.027 --> 00:45:45.920
MATT: You do get a night's rest,
so you did manage to

1131
00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.066
rest off your point of exhaustion.

1132
00:45:48.066 --> 00:45:49.233
ASHLEY: I did, okay.

1133
00:45:50.969 --> 00:45:53.035
Boy, I guess...

1134
00:45:53.035 --> 00:45:54.359
I want to get this finished,

1135
00:45:54.359 --> 00:45:56.786
so how much can I read?

1136
00:45:56.786 --> 00:45:58.647
If I have 17 hours left.

1137
00:45:58.647 --> 00:46:01.633
MATT: A full 17 hours will put
you at 5:00am the next day.

1138
00:46:01.633 --> 00:46:02.560
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1139
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.298
MATT: You could do it, but you'll be--

1140
00:46:04.298 --> 00:46:05.216
ASHLEY: A point of exhaustion.

1141
00:46:05.216 --> 00:46:07.339
MATT: Yeah, a point of exhaustion
if you go straight through.

1142
00:46:07.339 --> 00:46:08.629
LAURA: Give it some time, Yasha.

1143
00:46:08.629 --> 00:46:10.701
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think I'll just,

1144
00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:13.064
I'll read maybe half.

1145
00:46:13.064 --> 00:46:15.323
MATT: Eight-ish?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1146
00:46:15.323 --> 00:46:17.325
MATT: Okay. Eight, nine hours.
ASHLEY: What time is it now?

1147
00:46:17.325 --> 00:46:19.210
TALIESIN: Go for nine.
ASHLEY: I'll go for nine.

1148
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.095
TALIESIN: Yeah, just so you have
eight left for the next day.

1149
00:46:21.095 --> 00:46:21.928
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1150
00:46:21.928 --> 00:46:23.794
MATT: So that'll be your thing for the day.

1151
00:46:23.794 --> 00:46:25.742
You're going to research, the two of you?

1152
00:46:25.742 --> 00:46:27.922
MARISHA: Yeah, anyone else want to go? Library?

1153
00:46:27.922 --> 00:46:29.503
Caduceus?

1154
00:46:29.503 --> 00:46:31.442
TALIESIN: You know what?
MARISHA: Jester?

1155
00:46:31.442 --> 00:46:33.763
LAURA: Ooh, ah, ooh--

1156
00:46:33.763 --> 00:46:34.645
MARISHA: No pressure.

1157
00:46:34.645 --> 00:46:37.262
TALIESIN: I'm going to come to the library.
LAURA: Yeah, I'll go to the library, too, okay.

1158
00:46:37.262 --> 00:46:39.722
MARISHA: Are you feeling pressure because Caduceus said yes?

1159
00:46:39.722 --> 00:46:42.369
LAURA: Well, I'm just wondering if there's books

1160
00:46:42.369 --> 00:46:44.482
on, like, tarot reading or anything.

1161
00:46:44.482 --> 00:46:46.500
SAM: Mm, smart.

1162
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.614
MARISHA: There probably is, yeah.

1163
00:46:48.614 --> 00:46:50.197
LAURA: Yeah, I want to go, just--

1164
00:46:50.197 --> 00:46:51.639
you know, I don't need it,

1165
00:46:51.639 --> 00:46:54.020
but I just thought that maybe
it would be good to...

1166
00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:57.056
learn from somebody else, maybe.

1167
00:46:57.056 --> 00:46:58.009
MARISHA: Nott, what are you up to?

1168
00:46:58.009 --> 00:46:59.763
SAM: I'm going to just do some shopping.

1169
00:46:59.763 --> 00:47:01.474
Go to a stationary store.

1170
00:47:01.474 --> 00:47:02.489
MARISHA: Cool.

1171
00:47:02.489 --> 00:47:03.972
Hey, if I give you some money,

1172
00:47:03.972 --> 00:47:05.743
will you see if you can buy me some, like, darts

1173
00:47:05.743 --> 00:47:08.375
or ninja stars, or darts?
SAM: Yes, of course, yes.

1174
00:47:08.375 --> 00:47:10.613
MARISHA: Or just something that's cool to throw at people.

1175
00:47:10.613 --> 00:47:13.486
SAM: I will take your money,
and I will return with weapons.

1176
00:47:13.486 --> 00:47:15.236
MARISHA: Thank you. I give Nott...

1177
00:47:17.466 --> 00:47:19.049
Ff--

1178
00:47:19.049 --> 00:47:20.364
TRAVIS: Come on.

1179
00:47:20.364 --> 00:47:21.947
MARISHA: Wait, let me see.

1180
00:47:23.476 --> 00:47:26.254
I give Nott 40 gold.

1181
00:47:26.254 --> 00:47:27.520
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: That should be enough.

1182
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.378
TRAVIS: Uh, yeah.

1183
00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:32.087
MATT: So reading, researching, researching,

1184
00:47:32.087 --> 00:47:34.857
shopping, researching, researching, bearding.

1185
00:47:34.857 --> 00:47:36.462
TRAVIS: Yeah, but, like, I'm going to go and get like,

1186
00:47:36.462 --> 00:47:38.380
maybe, like, a facial, you know.

1187
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.017
Like something--
MARISHA: Like a spa day.

1188
00:47:40.017 --> 00:47:41.947
TRAVIS: Yeah, take a little self-care.

1189
00:47:41.947 --> 00:47:42.985
MATT: Fjord spa day.

1190
00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:45.196
TRAVIS: No, too late, you're doing your shit, spa for Fjord.

1191
00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:46.987
LAURA: No, but-- no no no.

1192
00:47:46.987 --> 00:47:48.570
(laughter)

1193
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.945
I wanted to go to the spa, but I have hair--

1194
00:47:50.945 --> 00:47:53.653
I have hair oil.

1195
00:47:53.653 --> 00:47:55.763
TRAVIS: Wait, from that creepy place?

1196
00:47:55.763 --> 00:47:57.705
LAURA: Hey, man, it's been doing some good things.

1197
00:47:57.705 --> 00:47:59.008
Look how long my hair has gotten.

1198
00:47:59.008 --> 00:48:00.423
TALIESIN: I figured we'd do the spa tomorrow,

1199
00:48:00.423 --> 00:48:02.605
right before we left would
be the way to just--

1200
00:48:02.605 --> 00:48:04.030
LAURA: Look--

1201
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.243
TRAVIS: Let me try the spa first, and then we'll--

1202
00:48:06.243 --> 00:48:07.706
SAM: (as Sprinkle) "Kill me."

1203
00:48:07.706 --> 00:48:10.179
(laughter)

1204
00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:12.023
LAURA: Shut up, Sprinkle!

1205
00:48:13.215 --> 00:48:14.971
You want it?
TRAVIS: No, no, I'm fine, thank you.

1206
00:48:14.971 --> 00:48:16.495
Tonight, perhaps.
MARISHA: I missed Sprinkle.

1207
00:48:16.495 --> 00:48:17.823
TRAVIS: I'll double up on the treatment.

1208
00:48:17.823 --> 00:48:19.926
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1209
00:48:19.926 --> 00:48:21.598
(Matt laughing)

1210
00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:23.757
MATT: You do find yourself in the Shimmer Ward there is

1211
00:48:23.757 --> 00:48:25.336
the Silver--
TRAVIS: <i>I</i> find myself?

1212
00:48:25.336 --> 00:48:27.614
MATT: The Silvered Sunset Oasis, which is an actual

1213
00:48:27.614 --> 00:48:30.736
bathhouse where you can pamper yourself.

1214
00:48:30.736 --> 00:48:33.457
Depending how long you want to stay there.

1215
00:48:33.457 --> 00:48:35.771
How long do you intend to be pampered?

1216
00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:37.723
TRAVIS: I mean, what sort of packages do they have?

1217
00:48:37.723 --> 00:48:39.488
I mean, I--
TALIESIN: Scout, scout.

1218
00:48:39.488 --> 00:48:41.752
TRAVIS: I didn't get a tattoo, I'm fucking loaded.

1219
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.294
(Marisha laughing)

1220
00:48:43.294 --> 00:48:45.898
LIAM: Silvered Sunset is slang
for sunning your butt.

1221
00:48:45.898 --> 00:48:47.416
TRAVIS: Let's call it four hours.

1222
00:48:47.416 --> 00:48:50.569
I'm going to get a full--
yeah, that's right.

1223
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:52.694
Four hours worth of treatments.

1224
00:48:52.694 --> 00:48:54.024
MATT: Okay, here in the Shimmer Ward--

1225
00:48:54.024 --> 00:48:56.214
TRAVIS: Maybe a message, I might
get my feet trimmed up,

1226
00:48:56.214 --> 00:48:57.894
my toenails are scary.

1227
00:48:57.894 --> 00:48:58.785
(Laura and Marisha laughing)

1228
00:48:58.785 --> 00:49:00.144
TALIESIN: You're being better to yourself on graph paper

1229
00:49:00.144 --> 00:49:01.899
than I was over the entire Christmas break.

1230
00:49:01.899 --> 00:49:03.508
(Matt laughing)

1231
00:49:03.508 --> 00:49:05.459
LAURA: Do something with your teeth?

1232
00:49:06.368 --> 00:49:07.896
Like help them grow more.

1233
00:49:07.896 --> 00:49:09.439
TRAVIS: Oh.

1234
00:49:09.439 --> 00:49:11.593
God, sure.

1235
00:49:11.593 --> 00:49:16.430
MARISHA: That was an entirely
weird way to phrase it. (laughing)

1236
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:19.772
TRAVIS: And I look for a facial, and a haircut.

1237
00:49:19.772 --> 00:49:20.888
MATT: 15 gold.

1238
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:23.223
LAURA: That's it?

1239
00:49:23.223 --> 00:49:25.052
MARISHA: I just gave Nott 40 gold.

1240
00:49:25.052 --> 00:49:26.796
TRAVIS: I'll tip them five to make sure they take

1241
00:49:26.796 --> 00:49:28.965
extra special care.
MATT: Wow.

1242
00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:30.700
LIAM: Oh, he's going to be handsome.

1243
00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.474
MATT: Oh, debonair motherfucker
coming out of here in a few hours.

1244
00:49:32.474 --> 00:49:35.783
LAURA: And he's all buff now, you guys.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1245
00:49:35.783 --> 00:49:36.616
LAURA: Hottie Fjord.

1246
00:49:36.616 --> 00:49:38.366
MATT: All right, you're going shopping?

1247
00:49:38.366 --> 00:49:40.220
SAM: I'm going to just stop by a couple places.

1248
00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.564
In halfling form, I will go shopping for--

1249
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:46.552
first I'll start with some throwing weapons.

1250
00:49:46.552 --> 00:49:49.991
Darts, throwing stars, any sort of--

1251
00:49:49.991 --> 00:49:51.466
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Blow darts, whatever--

1252
00:49:51.466 --> 00:49:53.068
MATT: How much are you purchasing?

1253
00:49:53.068 --> 00:49:54.983
SAM: Well, I'm going to see what they have,

1254
00:49:54.983 --> 00:49:56.893
and I've got 40 gold to spend.

1255
00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:58.342
MATT: I mean, pretty much any of the weapons

1256
00:49:58.342 --> 00:50:01.831
that are basic or martial are available
here in Rexxentrum, it's a huge capital.

1257
00:50:01.831 --> 00:50:05.148
Most supplies of any kind can be found here

1258
00:50:05.148 --> 00:50:07.221
through some searching.

1259
00:50:07.221 --> 00:50:09.412
So if you're looking for...

1260
00:50:10.646 --> 00:50:11.954
darts or a dagger,

1261
00:50:11.954 --> 00:50:13.746
I mean, the darts are like five copper pieces a piece,

1262
00:50:13.746 --> 00:50:15.304
they're super inexpensive.

1263
00:50:15.304 --> 00:50:17.963
Daggers are two gold a piece.

1264
00:50:17.963 --> 00:50:19.054
Anything else you're looking for?

1265
00:50:19.054 --> 00:50:21.839
SAM: Ninja stars.
MATT: Ninja stars?

1266
00:50:21.839 --> 00:50:25.747
They don't really have ninja stars here so much.

1267
00:50:25.747 --> 00:50:28.405
There aren't really ninjas

1268
00:50:28.405 --> 00:50:31.940
in the Dwendalian Empire.

1269
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.979
SAM: Can I go to a blacksmith and describe it?

1270
00:50:33.979 --> 00:50:34.972
MATT: Yes, you can.

1271
00:50:34.972 --> 00:50:36.822
SAM: All right, and is that something that would add

1272
00:50:36.822 --> 00:50:39.425
more fucking days to our waiting in Rexxentrum?

1273
00:50:39.425 --> 00:50:41.493
MARISHA: Yeah, don't do it, if--
TRAVIS: Custom made.

1274
00:50:41.493 --> 00:50:43.960
MATT: It'll take about a day to custom make them,

1275
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.793
because he has to like--
SAM: I'll rush order--

1276
00:50:45.793 --> 00:50:47.537
MATT: Depends how many you want.
SAM: Two.

1277
00:50:47.537 --> 00:50:50.100
MATT: Two? You can get two done in, like, an hour.

1278
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.000
SAM: Cool.

1279
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.559
LIAM: You hate this city like Trinket.

1280
00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:53.765
(laughter)

1281
00:50:53.765 --> 00:50:56.765
MATT: Five silver per custom "ninja" star.

1282
00:50:58.445 --> 00:51:00.812
SAM: I want them inscribed.

1283
00:51:00.812 --> 00:51:01.756
MATT: Okay.

1284
00:51:01.756 --> 00:51:04.643
SAM: Or stamped or something, I want one to say "pop"

1285
00:51:04.643 --> 00:51:05.933
and the other to say "pop."

1286
00:51:05.933 --> 00:51:06.929
(Marisha laughing)

1287
00:51:06.929 --> 00:51:08.879
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: So both say "pop."

1288
00:51:08.879 --> 00:51:09.909
(laughter)

1289
00:51:09.909 --> 00:51:11.966
MATT: They both say "pop."

1290
00:51:11.966 --> 00:51:13.243
You got it.

1291
00:51:13.243 --> 00:51:15.144
That'll add an additional gold to it.

1292
00:51:15.144 --> 00:51:16.708
(Laura laughing)

1293
00:51:16.708 --> 00:51:18.237
TALIESIN: Until you get really good at throwing them,

1294
00:51:18.237 --> 00:51:20.345
you're going to hit people,
and they're going to be like,

1295
00:51:20.345 --> 00:51:21.178
"'Bob'?"

1296
00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:22.185
"'Bob'?"

1297
00:51:22.185 --> 00:51:24.852
(laughter)

1298
00:51:27.012 --> 00:51:28.362
TALIESIN: "Bobby?"

1299
00:51:30.451 --> 00:51:31.709
TRAVIS: "'Bob'?"

1300
00:51:32.615 --> 00:51:33.757
TALIESIN: Bob bob!

1301
00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:34.815
MATT: All right.

1302
00:51:34.815 --> 00:51:38.133
So two custom ninja stars.

1303
00:51:38.133 --> 00:51:43.133
SAM: I will also go to a
stationary type-store,

1304
00:51:43.207 --> 00:51:44.832
a <i>papier</i>.

1305
00:51:44.832 --> 00:51:47.559
MATT: Yeah, parchment of all different qualities

1306
00:51:47.559 --> 00:51:48.782
is available here, yeah.

1307
00:51:48.782 --> 00:51:52.713
SAM: I'd like a stack of hard card stock of some sort.

1308
00:51:52.713 --> 00:51:55.358
MATT: Sure, Ye Olde FedEx Office.

1309
00:51:55.358 --> 00:51:56.370
(Sam laughing)

1310
00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:57.699
SAM: You know, the good shit.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

1311
00:51:57.699 --> 00:51:58.532
SAM: Okay, and--

1312
00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:00.115
MATT: Thick parchment's easy enough to come across here.

1313
00:52:00.115 --> 00:52:03.633
SAM: Just smallish, and then I want two big poster boards.

1314
00:52:05.554 --> 00:52:06.754
LAURA: What is...

1315
00:52:07.722 --> 00:52:09.083
TALIESIN: Are we going to a science fair?

1316
00:52:09.083 --> 00:52:11.862
MATT: There are wooden slats that can be painted on

1317
00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.495
that's usually used for signage.

1318
00:52:13.495 --> 00:52:15.370
SAM: Okay.
MATT: Not so much normal poster board.

1319
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:17.016
SAM: I'll take that.
MATT: All right.

1320
00:52:17.016 --> 00:52:20.148
So, let me see, so six gold
for the two custom ninja stars.

1321
00:52:21.348 --> 00:52:24.418
Two of the sign posts would be about,

1322
00:52:24.418 --> 00:52:28.444
eh, three silver each,
along with the stack,

1323
00:52:28.444 --> 00:52:30.146
I think I'll put an additional
gold in that total,

1324
00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.530
so that'd be seven gold.

1325
00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:34.521
SAM: Seven gold, I got 33 left over.

1326
00:52:34.521 --> 00:52:36.942
TALIESIN: If there's anything in, like, the off-season

1327
00:52:36.942 --> 00:52:40.189
Harvest Festival section that looks really nice

1328
00:52:40.189 --> 00:52:41.732
and might spruce up--
TRAVIS: Shut up.

1329
00:52:41.732 --> 00:52:44.162
(laughter)

1330
00:52:44.162 --> 00:52:45.628
75% off.

1331
00:52:45.628 --> 00:52:46.899
(laughter)

1332
00:52:46.899 --> 00:52:48.732
SAM: That's it.
MATT: All righty.

1333
00:52:49.573 --> 00:52:50.905
ASHLEY: Metal harvest pumpkin?

1334
00:52:50.905 --> 00:52:53.572
(laughter)

1335
00:52:54.555 --> 00:52:55.821
TRAVIS: It's really nice.

1336
00:52:55.821 --> 00:52:57.835
MATT: All right, those who are
researching, you make your way

1337
00:52:57.835 --> 00:52:59.735
to the Rexxentrum archive of the Cobalt Soul.

1338
00:52:59.735 --> 00:53:01.813
What is it you would like
to research while you're there?

1339
00:53:01.813 --> 00:53:06.274
MARISHA: Okay, so, I was
actually starting to research

1340
00:53:07.132 --> 00:53:09.549
anything that might mention multiple beacons,

1341
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:11.624
or where these things actually came from.

1342
00:53:11.624 --> 00:53:13.654
And of course, the furthest that I got

1343
00:53:13.654 --> 00:53:15.287
was that they were pre-Calamity

1344
00:53:15.287 --> 00:53:20.263
and no one really knows how many there might be.

1345
00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:23.090
The other thing that I was wanting to research,

1346
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.308
and I ran out of time, was other shackles

1347
00:53:26.308 --> 00:53:29.229
of the Chained Oblivion and where they're located.

1348
00:53:29.229 --> 00:53:31.668
LIAM: While she says all that, Caleb had been going into

1349
00:53:31.668 --> 00:53:36.094
his bag to look at his notes and his research

1350
00:53:36.094 --> 00:53:38.930
on Nott's problem.
MATT: Yeah.

1351
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.448
LIAM: But as Beauregard's talking,
he's looking, he's looking--

1352
00:53:41.448 --> 00:53:44.150
MARISHA: Can I kind of peek over?

1353
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:46.187
LIAM: Well, he's not opening anything up,

1354
00:53:46.187 --> 00:53:49.262
he's just preparing to do it, and the more you talked,

1355
00:53:49.262 --> 00:53:52.891
the less he looked, and then he just started listening.

1356
00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:55.202
So he veered over to what you're talking about.

1357
00:53:55.202 --> 00:53:56.102
MARISHA: Oh.

1358
00:53:56.102 --> 00:54:00.139
Did you want to-- were you like-- did you want to--

1359
00:54:00.139 --> 00:54:01.759
you can do your own research.

1360
00:54:01.759 --> 00:54:05.357
LIAM: No, no, this is more interesting to me today.

1361
00:54:05.357 --> 00:54:08.580
Perhaps we can find--
MARISHA: What was that? What are you doing?

1362
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.788
LIAM: (stuttering)

1363
00:54:10.788 --> 00:54:13.529
It is spell research, spell work.

1364
00:54:13.529 --> 00:54:14.858
MARISHA: Oh.

1365
00:54:14.858 --> 00:54:16.135
LIAM: Always.

1366
00:54:16.135 --> 00:54:18.780
But this is more pressing for today.

1367
00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.780
MARISHA: What'd you want to find?

1368
00:54:23.221 --> 00:54:25.638
LIAM: You know, it's complicated.

1369
00:54:27.058 --> 00:54:30.416
I'm trying to help Nott with something.

1370
00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:33.502
MARISHA: All right.

1371
00:54:35.761 --> 00:54:36.920
Yeah.

1372
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.913
LIAM: Beacons.

1373
00:54:38.913 --> 00:54:42.996
Task at hand. "Stay on task, Widogast."

1374
00:54:42.996 --> 00:54:46.243
We should see if we can find any mention

1375
00:54:46.243 --> 00:54:50.633
of objects or anything from the heavens

1376
00:54:50.633 --> 00:54:55.633
falling in different parts
of the world, outside of Xhorhas.

1377
00:54:55.936 --> 00:54:59.568
To get an idea of how widespread
they are as a phenomenon.

1378
00:54:59.568 --> 00:55:02.551
Maybe we'll find nothing, but it's worth a try.

1379
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:07.418
MARISHA: Cool. Maybe I can go back through
all the archeological records

1380
00:55:07.418 --> 00:55:08.717
that the Cobalt Soul is researching

1381
00:55:08.717 --> 00:55:10.775
and see if anything pops up,
and if you want to do

1382
00:55:10.775 --> 00:55:14.293
like the find-- hit the books.

1383
00:55:14.293 --> 00:55:15.196
LIAM: Okay.

1384
00:55:15.196 --> 00:55:16.338
MARISHA: All right.

1385
00:55:16.338 --> 00:55:17.614
Ready, break.

1386
00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:18.912
Break!

1387
00:55:18.912 --> 00:55:21.351
Wait, hang on, hang on.
Put your hand in like this.

1388
00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:24.584
Okay, ready, and then we're going to be like--

1389
00:55:24.584 --> 00:55:26.235
LIAM: What?
We're going to be like what?

1390
00:55:26.235 --> 00:55:28.095
MARISHA: This is-- ah!

1391
00:55:28.095 --> 00:55:29.089
Okay, okay.

1392
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:30.154
LAURA: I know this thing!

1393
00:55:30.154 --> 00:55:31.084
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1394
00:55:31.084 --> 00:55:32.710
Did you find where the tarot cards were?

1395
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:33.745
LAURA: Oh, right, nevermind.

1396
00:55:33.745 --> 00:55:35.369
MARISHA: No, no, wait, come here, come here!
LAURA: Okay, cool.

1397
00:55:35.369 --> 00:55:37.996
MARISHA: And then you can go find--
Ready, and-- (shouting) Caduceus!

1398
00:55:37.996 --> 00:55:39.289
Caduceus, come here, we're
going to do a thing!

1399
00:55:39.289 --> 00:55:40.844
TALIESIN: I have wandered off, I am gone.

1400
00:55:40.844 --> 00:55:42.458
MARISHA: Caduc--
LAURA: We're in a library, shut up.

1401
00:55:42.458 --> 00:55:44.552
MARISHA: It's <i>my</i> library!

1402
00:55:44.552 --> 00:55:45.881
LAURA: That's right!

1403
00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:47.649
MARISHA: It's not my library.

1404
00:55:47.649 --> 00:55:48.993
It's not my library.

1405
00:55:48.993 --> 00:55:51.545
MATT: You look up and see
Yudala Fon looking over the railing,

1406
00:55:51.545 --> 00:55:53.366
and they go, "Shh."

1407
00:55:53.366 --> 00:55:56.487
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was just--
yeah, okay, ready, and--

1408
00:55:56.487 --> 00:55:59.454
LAURA and MARISHA: And break!
LIAM: (whispering) Break.

1409
00:55:59.454 --> 00:56:01.393
MATT: All right, so you're researching what?

1410
00:56:01.393 --> 00:56:03.704
MARISHA: I'm going to check the archeological dig records,

1411
00:56:03.704 --> 00:56:05.968
maybe talk with Yudala, see if anything,

1412
00:56:05.968 --> 00:56:09.135
as far back as I can go, might match a beacon.

1413
00:56:09.135 --> 00:56:11.394
MATT: All right, make an investigation check.

1414
00:56:11.394 --> 00:56:12.893
MARISHA: (sighs)

1415
00:56:12.893 --> 00:56:14.226
Not that dice.

1416
00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:16.467
Lucky jade.

1417
00:56:17.895 --> 00:56:20.637
Does it count? It's out of the box.
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

1418
00:56:20.637 --> 00:56:22.072
MARISHA: But it's a roll.
LIAM: Yeah.

1419
00:56:22.072 --> 00:56:23.913
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right.

1420
00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:25.985
LIAM: It's on a squishy surface, but flat on it.

1421
00:56:25.985 --> 00:56:27.316
MATT: Yep.

1422
00:56:27.316 --> 00:56:30.389
MARISHA: 25.
MATT: 25, okay.

1423
00:56:30.389 --> 00:56:34.028
Looking through the archeological records

1424
00:56:34.028 --> 00:56:37.665
that currently reside under
the scope of the Cobalt Soul

1425
00:56:37.665 --> 00:56:42.665
dealing with any, you know,
pre-Calamity, Arcanum digs,

1426
00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:46.390
ruins, even some mentions of things

1427
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:50.426
off-site at like, you know, Issylra,

1428
00:56:50.426 --> 00:56:53.335
and other excavations that have happened.

1429
00:56:53.335 --> 00:56:57.768
Nothing catches your eye of any
previously excavated beacons.

1430
00:56:59.256 --> 00:57:01.484
Talk about many relics and, you know,

1431
00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.572
something called the Vestiges of Divergence,

1432
00:57:03.572 --> 00:57:07.263
and something referring to, you know,

1433
00:57:08.314 --> 00:57:12.160
like relic tech almost like, the magical artifacts

1434
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.427
on a larger scale that were created

1435
00:57:14.427 --> 00:57:16.735
by some of these older,

1436
00:57:18.777 --> 00:57:22.477
mage-based mageocracies that
ruled during the Age of Arcanum,

1437
00:57:22.477 --> 00:57:24.421
that waged war against each other,

1438
00:57:24.421 --> 00:57:28.612
and some of them against divinity itself.

1439
00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:31.538
But, in those regards,
none of the excavations,

1440
00:57:31.538 --> 00:57:33.528
and any of the relics
that have been categorized,

1441
00:57:33.528 --> 00:57:35.595
that have been studied,
that have been made record of,

1442
00:57:35.595 --> 00:57:38.771
resemble what was recently found in Shattengrad.

1443
00:57:38.771 --> 00:57:40.347
MARISHA: And how many years back did I go?

1444
00:57:40.347 --> 00:57:42.003
Was I able to go?

1445
00:57:42.003 --> 00:57:43.676
MATT: Well, the Empire's only been around

1446
00:57:43.676 --> 00:57:46.818
for maybe three centuries total.

1447
00:57:46.818 --> 00:57:48.357
So.

1448
00:57:48.357 --> 00:57:49.780
MARISHA: Yeah.

1449
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:52.897
MATT: A little longer, I think, actually.

1450
00:57:52.897 --> 00:57:54.013
But...

1451
00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.080
you can go back as far as

1452
00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.617
maybe two and a half centuries, 250 years.

1453
00:58:01.617 --> 00:58:05.903
MARISHA: So in 250 years, one has been found in the Empire.

1454
00:58:05.903 --> 00:58:07.137
MATT: Correct.

1455
00:58:07.137 --> 00:58:09.772
MARISHA: And there are no
records from the Cobalt Soul

1456
00:58:09.772 --> 00:58:14.571
for other continents here
of the archeological digs?

1457
00:58:14.571 --> 00:58:15.742
MATT: The things that you've read there

1458
00:58:15.742 --> 00:58:18.518
don't mention anything of
the objects you're seeking.

1459
00:58:18.518 --> 00:58:19.999
MARISHA: In, like, the other ones?

1460
00:58:19.999 --> 00:58:21.513
MATT: Nope.
MARISHA: All right.

1461
00:58:21.513 --> 00:58:22.346
Okay.

1462
00:58:23.296 --> 00:58:26.028
Fucking nothing, in 250 years.

1463
00:58:26.028 --> 00:58:27.761
Just the one.

1464
00:58:27.761 --> 00:58:28.724
What about you?

1465
00:58:28.724 --> 00:58:30.929
LIAM: I don't know, I haven't rolled yet.
MATT: What are you researching?

1466
00:58:30.929 --> 00:58:33.695
LIAM: I want to look through the histories

1467
00:58:33.695 --> 00:58:36.927
of the Age of Arcanum, specifically,

1468
00:58:36.927 --> 00:58:41.208
for any unexplained things found,

1469
00:58:41.208 --> 00:58:45.866
anything related to astronomy, meteorites,

1470
00:58:45.866 --> 00:58:49.185
things falling from the sky,
things that even then--

1471
00:58:49.185 --> 00:58:51.180
and this is long ago,
so it's a long shot--

1472
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:53.706
but things even they did not understand.

1473
00:58:54.573 --> 00:58:56.419
MATT: Certainly, go ahead and
make an investigation check.

1474
00:58:56.419 --> 00:59:00.038
LIAM: Am I alone, or with lots
of people around where I am?

1475
00:59:00.038 --> 00:59:02.001
MATT: The library is as busy as it normally is,

1476
00:59:02.001 --> 00:59:03.282
which isn't a huge crowd,

1477
00:59:03.282 --> 00:59:04.607
there's, you know, a handful of individuals

1478
00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:06.673
that are here on their own research.

1479
00:59:06.673 --> 00:59:08.251
I'd say a dozen people total in the library

1480
00:59:08.251 --> 00:59:10.978
that aren't themselves of the Cobalt Soul.

1481
00:59:10.978 --> 00:59:13.518
Then maybe, from what you
can immediately look around,

1482
00:59:13.518 --> 00:59:16.312
there are 15 or 16 members of the actual archive

1483
00:59:16.312 --> 00:59:17.573
that are visible in this chamber.

1484
00:59:17.573 --> 00:59:19.981
LIAM: So, and I am in view of those people as well.

1485
00:59:19.981 --> 00:59:22.331
MATT: Yeah. It's open.
LIAM: All right, nevermind.

1486
00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:27.390
18.

1487
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:28.831
MATT: 18, okay.

1488
00:59:30.731 --> 00:59:32.620
There are records of things
falling from the heavens,

1489
00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:35.177
you know, referred to as meteors.

1490
00:59:36.568 --> 00:59:38.518
Iron and metals that have been made and crafted

1491
00:59:38.518 --> 00:59:40.549
into sets of armor of legend.

1492
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:44.515
Old generals of wars and forgotten ages

1493
00:59:44.515 --> 00:59:47.856
that used the star metal
as the basis of their weaponry.

1494
00:59:47.856 --> 00:59:49.622
As brittle as it began, with enchantments

1495
00:59:49.622 --> 00:59:53.383
it became extremely strong, and resilient,

1496
00:59:53.383 --> 00:59:57.883
and in some cases, able
to absorb enchantment quickly.

1497
01:00:00.484 --> 01:00:04.653
There's talk of what was thought to be meteors,

1498
01:00:04.653 --> 01:00:08.048
but instead happened to be residual elements

1499
01:00:08.048 --> 01:00:10.353
from perhaps Arcanum weapons that were jettisoned

1500
01:00:10.353 --> 01:00:12.669
into the sky and returning hundreds of years later,

1501
01:00:12.669 --> 01:00:16.224
that then just impacted into the ocean and were lost.

1502
01:00:16.224 --> 01:00:18.697
There's talk of a meteor that crashed

1503
01:00:18.697 --> 01:00:21.575
not but 10 years before into the Cyrengreen Forest,

1504
01:00:21.575 --> 01:00:25.392
just above Deastok, that vanished,

1505
01:00:25.392 --> 01:00:27.924
though the impact destroyed a portion of the forest.

1506
01:00:29.132 --> 01:00:31.239
There is talk of--
LIAM: Wipe.

1507
01:00:31.239 --> 01:00:33.095
MARISHA: (laughs)

1508
01:00:34.861 --> 01:00:38.436
MATT: Most of it's a series of different impacts

1509
01:00:38.436 --> 01:00:42.406
that all have led to recovery of just material.

1510
01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.406
Most of it seems to be iron,

1511
01:00:44.406 --> 01:00:46.706
some of them are various odd metals,

1512
01:00:46.706 --> 01:00:49.280
and a handful of them have been very odd metals

1513
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.680
that have been since grabbed by whatever group

1514
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.761
or political faction was in charge of that recovery process,

1515
01:00:57.761 --> 01:01:00.858
and then was, the records either vanished

1516
01:01:00.858 --> 01:01:03.000
based on who they were sold to.

1517
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.786
There are some records of them supposedly,

1518
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:06.974
some of these recovered meteors going up on auction

1519
01:01:06.974 --> 01:01:08.392
on different auction houses,

1520
01:01:08.392 --> 01:01:10.047
as well as the auction house in Port Damali.

1521
01:01:10.047 --> 01:01:15.047
Twice in the past century such rare odd metals

1522
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:17.182
that have been recovered from these impacts have.

1523
01:01:17.182 --> 01:01:20.247
Many people believe-- there is a prominent belief,

1524
01:01:20.247 --> 01:01:22.455
superstitious as it is largely considered,

1525
01:01:22.455 --> 01:01:24.049
that most of these meteors that do come through

1526
01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:26.532
in meteor showers themselves are parts of Ruidus,

1527
01:01:26.532 --> 01:01:29.891
the distant moon, breaking apart and making their way

1528
01:01:29.891 --> 01:01:30.724
towards the planet.

1529
01:01:30.724 --> 01:01:34.863
Some believe because it's decaying and just showering,

1530
01:01:34.863 --> 01:01:37.259
its decay upon the planet in clumps,

1531
01:01:37.259 --> 01:01:42.222
others believe it's supposedly

1532
01:01:42.222 --> 01:01:44.732
distant warriors' spirits that themselves

1533
01:01:44.732 --> 01:01:47.487
are returning to the planet after
being lost on the battlefield.

1534
01:01:47.487 --> 01:01:50.382
There's all sorts of strange religious phenomenon

1535
01:01:50.382 --> 01:01:53.623
based around this celestial activity, when it does occur.

1536
01:01:53.623 --> 01:01:55.634
LIAM: Lots of strange things, but not really

1537
01:01:55.634 --> 01:01:58.009
what I'm digging for.
MATT: Not what you're looking for, yeah.

1538
01:01:58.009 --> 01:01:59.458
LIAM: Okay.

1539
01:01:59.458 --> 01:02:00.291
MARISHA: Fuck.

1540
01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:05.639
Any other time to research where the Chained Oblivion

1541
01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:10.639
and other shackles for it may be?

1542
01:02:11.077 --> 01:02:14.180
MATT: I believe the research has already been put into this.

1543
01:02:15.141 --> 01:02:15.983
MARISHA: Okay.

1544
01:02:15.983 --> 01:02:17.239
MATT: It isn't like you just keep banging

1545
01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:19.171
your head against the wall until more information comes out.

1546
01:02:19.171 --> 01:02:22.166
You've expended your research in this topic here,

1547
01:02:22.166 --> 01:02:25.432
and what you do know is that the shackles

1548
01:02:25.432 --> 01:02:29.667
are a very largely guarded, and largely forgotten secret

1549
01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:32.183
intentionally so people cannot research them in a library.

1550
01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.672
Because that would make them very easy to find

1551
01:02:33.672 --> 01:02:36.593
for people that don't have good intentions.

1552
01:02:36.593 --> 01:02:38.084
MARISHA: Yeah, that makes sense.

1553
01:02:38.084 --> 01:02:39.813
Well, nothing.

1554
01:02:39.813 --> 01:02:40.646
Boo.

1555
01:02:40.646 --> 01:02:42.850
LIAM: Well, you have to try.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1556
01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:45.491
LIAM: How much time did we just spend
doing that, would you reckon?

1557
01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:47.256
MATT: Half the day.
LIAM: Half a day.

1558
01:02:47.256 --> 01:02:48.871
MARISHA: You want to go back?

1559
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:50.245
MATT: I got another two people researching here.

1560
01:02:50.245 --> 01:02:51.353
LAURA: Yeah!

1561
01:02:51.353 --> 01:02:52.819
MATT: Come to you guys in a moment.

1562
01:02:52.819 --> 01:02:56.026
LAURA: I've got-- I'm sitting at a table.

1563
01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:56.859
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1564
01:02:56.859 --> 01:02:58.972
LAURA: I've got all of the cards pulled out

1565
01:02:58.972 --> 01:03:01.105
and I'm looking at them.

1566
01:03:01.105 --> 01:03:04.321
And I am looking for a

1567
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:07.488
book on tarot cards as well,

1568
01:03:07.488 --> 01:03:10.068
so that I can study them at the same time

1569
01:03:10.068 --> 01:03:12.720
I'm looking at my book.
MATT: Okay.

1570
01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.563
LAURA: And see what I can learn.
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

1571
01:03:16.932 --> 01:03:18.751
TALIESIN: I'm prepared to talk a lot.

1572
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:19.584
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1573
01:03:19.584 --> 01:03:23.012
(laughter)

1574
01:03:23.012 --> 01:03:24.178
TALIESIN: Yes.

1575
01:03:24.178 --> 01:03:25.813
LAURA: Seven.

1576
01:03:25.813 --> 01:03:26.646
MATT: Seven.

1577
01:03:28.521 --> 01:03:31.862
You get a little lost in your research

1578
01:03:31.862 --> 01:03:36.862
as you come upon drawn

1579
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.545
studies on the human body,

1580
01:03:38.545 --> 01:03:40.749
in which the musculature, and there's a lot of just

1581
01:03:40.749 --> 01:03:42.521
nude drawings in there, and--

1582
01:03:42.521 --> 01:03:43.733
LAURA: I bring those to the table.

1583
01:03:43.733 --> 01:03:47.065
MATT: And so you get kind of distracted for a while.

1584
01:03:47.065 --> 01:03:49.485
You do eventually find one book

1585
01:03:49.485 --> 01:03:54.123
that is a very simple study on

1586
01:03:54.123 --> 01:03:58.864
prominent and easily found use of tarot cards,

1587
01:03:58.864 --> 01:04:02.554
largely based around the Moonweaver.

1588
01:04:02.554 --> 01:04:04.247
And you sit down, you open the book,

1589
01:04:04.247 --> 01:04:05.813
and with the cards sprawled out, and you start going

1590
01:04:05.813 --> 01:04:09.175
from chapter to chapter, and none of the cards

1591
01:04:09.175 --> 01:04:11.254
are the same as the ones you found in the book.

1592
01:04:11.254 --> 01:04:13.000
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1593
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.388
I can add to this, if you like.

1594
01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:15.221
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1595
01:04:15.221 --> 01:04:20.023
TALIESIN: There is, specifically when
dealing with oracle cards,

1596
01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.727
do you mind if I add a little canon?
MATT: Go for it.

1597
01:04:22.727 --> 01:04:25.085
Just keep in mind, she rolled a seven.

1598
01:04:25.085 --> 01:04:27.300
TALIESIN: Oracle cards vary from region to region

1599
01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.620
and religion to religion. They tend to have

1600
01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.937
unique properties depending on what culture

1601
01:04:32.937 --> 01:04:36.552
and what god is being worshiped

1602
01:04:36.552 --> 01:04:39.087
of how they're developed and how they're built.

1603
01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:41.325
Moonweaver cards specifically,

1604
01:04:41.325 --> 01:04:43.786
while there is a general build,

1605
01:04:43.786 --> 01:04:47.561
the Moonweaver encourages creativity and deceit.

1606
01:04:47.561 --> 01:04:51.803
So Moonweaver decks tend to be all over the fucking map.

1607
01:04:51.803 --> 01:04:53.789
And this is definitely--
LAURA: And this is a Moonweaver--

1608
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:55.838
TALIESIN: This is definitely a Moonweaver deck.

1609
01:04:55.838 --> 01:04:59.160
MATT: Yeah, and to that point, and correct me if I'm wrong,

1610
01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.777
a number of the cards in the deck that you have are blank.

1611
01:05:02.777 --> 01:05:03.877
TALIESIN: Yep.

1612
01:05:03.877 --> 01:05:05.077
LAURA: How many?

1613
01:05:06.352 --> 01:05:11.079
TALIESIN: There's a collection of them that you've noticed,

1614
01:05:11.079 --> 01:05:14.410
and then there's off, sort of on the edge,

1615
01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.253
there's a bunch that look like they're

1616
01:05:17.461 --> 01:05:20.362
old and fucked up and hard to even read anymore,

1617
01:05:20.362 --> 01:05:22.527
and then there's another collection of them that

1618
01:05:22.527 --> 01:05:24.237
have a couple little sketches that

1619
01:05:24.237 --> 01:05:26.256
seemed like they were stopped, and then a whole bunch

1620
01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:29.429
of blank ones, that are just ready to be filled.

1621
01:05:29.429 --> 01:05:34.429
You get the sense that this was an ongoing art project,

1622
01:05:34.439 --> 01:05:37.917
and that this was not a bought deck, but a made one.

1623
01:05:37.917 --> 01:05:39.816
LAURA: Oh my gosh!
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1624
01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:43.850
LAURA: Oh. I-- oh.

1625
01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:46.543
Jester just starts crying.

1626
01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.056
ALL: Aww.

1627
01:05:48.056 --> 01:05:50.719
LAURA: Because she's realizing, I mean, that's amazing,

1628
01:05:50.719 --> 01:05:54.204
she's looking at Molly's art.

1629
01:05:54.204 --> 01:05:57.226
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's, yeah.

1630
01:05:57.226 --> 01:05:59.422
It's not as good as your art.

1631
01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.943
LAURA: No, but it's so good.

1632
01:06:01.943 --> 01:06:03.737
And I can finish some of it.

1633
01:06:03.737 --> 01:06:06.143
TRAVIS: Yeah, those little blank cards
could use happy beans.

1634
01:06:06.143 --> 01:06:08.828
LAURA: Well, obviously, somebody's going to get dealt

1635
01:06:08.828 --> 01:06:10.014
the happy bean.

1636
01:06:10.014 --> 01:06:12.884
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Oh no.

1637
01:06:12.884 --> 01:06:14.640
This just keeps getting worse.

1638
01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.141
LAURA: Okay, well then, okay.

1639
01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:20.108
TALIESIN: The only obvious cards, since you rolled a four,

1640
01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:23.664
would be the moon card, which is--

1641
01:06:23.664 --> 01:06:25.345
LAURA: I rolled a seven, thank you.

1642
01:06:25.345 --> 01:06:28.726
TALIESIN: Okay, so inevitably there's always a moon card,

1643
01:06:28.726 --> 01:06:31.011
there's also, each card is built so that there's

1644
01:06:31.011 --> 01:06:32.990
a word at the bottom and a word at the top,

1645
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.681
so that when you flip it, there's word at the bottom

1646
01:06:34.681 --> 01:06:35.806
and then it's a new word.

1647
01:06:35.806 --> 01:06:37.589
LAURA: Okay, so each card can be two.

1648
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:40.415
TALIESIN: Each card can be two, and the moon is a beautiful,

1649
01:06:40.415 --> 01:06:44.154
large moon in a night sky, over this

1650
01:06:44.154 --> 01:06:46.532
crystal clear lake, and when you turn it over,

1651
01:06:46.532 --> 01:06:48.275
it's called the mirror.

1652
01:06:48.275 --> 01:06:50.587
And when you look in the reflection of the moon

1653
01:06:50.587 --> 01:06:53.961
in the lake, there are two moons.

1654
01:06:53.961 --> 01:06:54.912
TRAVIS: Like balls.

1655
01:06:54.912 --> 01:06:58.262
TALIESIN: And one smaller, reddish-purplish moon

1656
01:06:58.262 --> 01:07:02.131
sitting right behind the big, normal white moon,

1657
01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:04.893
which is not actually in the sky in the moon card;

1658
01:07:04.893 --> 01:07:07.179
it's just a single moon.

1659
01:07:07.179 --> 01:07:09.073
MATT: So for your half day of research into this,

1660
01:07:09.073 --> 01:07:11.416
you spend half of it looking through naked pictures

1661
01:07:11.416 --> 01:07:13.542
of people sketched in--
LAURA: It's a good day.

1662
01:07:13.542 --> 01:07:17.090
MATT: And the other half learn nothing about tarot cards

1663
01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:19.008
beyond just,
(Travis laughing)

1664
01:07:19.008 --> 01:07:23.493
just looking through the cards that Molly had left

1665
01:07:23.493 --> 01:07:28.063
incomplete, and yeah, that's about it.

1666
01:07:28.063 --> 01:07:30.577
TRAVIS: Well, it was time well spent.

1667
01:07:30.577 --> 01:07:31.514
MATT: Oh, very much so.

1668
01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:32.702
MARISHA: No, a lot was learned.

1669
01:07:32.702 --> 01:07:33.926
MATT: You may not always learn what you want,

1670
01:07:33.926 --> 01:07:35.014
but you learn what you need.

1671
01:07:35.014 --> 01:07:37.439
LAURA: Now, I remember

1672
01:07:37.439 --> 01:07:40.572
when Molly read my fortune

1673
01:07:40.572 --> 01:07:42.289
a couple times.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1674
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:44.516
LAURA: I pulled the card out myself,

1675
01:07:44.516 --> 01:07:48.027
or did he pull the card out for me?

1676
01:07:48.027 --> 01:07:51.195
TALIESIN: Do you know what a force is?

1677
01:07:51.195 --> 01:07:54.434
LAURA: I don't, I'm asking for Jester's sake, do I?

1678
01:07:54.434 --> 01:07:55.720
MATT: Actually, with a seven, no.

1679
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.647
TALIESIN: No, okay.

1680
01:07:57.647 --> 01:07:58.713
You pulled the card.

1681
01:07:58.713 --> 01:08:00.112
LAURA: I pulled the cards.
MATT: Yes.

1682
01:08:00.112 --> 01:08:00.945
LAURA: Okay.

1683
01:08:02.085 --> 01:08:04.853
Okay.

1684
01:08:04.853 --> 01:08:06.669
TALIESIN: Bless you.

1685
01:08:06.669 --> 01:08:09.911
LAURA: I need to remember how to

1686
01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:12.102
read other people's fortunes,

1687
01:08:12.102 --> 01:08:13.531
so I'm just going to try to do it

1688
01:08:13.531 --> 01:08:15.912
the way that Molly did it for me.

1689
01:08:15.912 --> 01:08:17.204
MATT: All right.

1690
01:08:17.204 --> 01:08:21.166
TALIESIN: Yeah, as we keep going. I'll
describe cards as they pop up, so.

1691
01:08:21.166 --> 01:08:23.659
LAURA: Okay, okay.
MATT: Caduceus.

1692
01:08:23.659 --> 01:08:25.648
TALIESIN: So yeah, I'm going to go find help,

1693
01:08:25.648 --> 01:08:28.659
because I don't understand anything that's happening here.

1694
01:08:28.659 --> 01:08:30.500
Is there a help desk?

1695
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.058
(laughter)

1696
01:08:32.058 --> 01:08:37.049
MATT: There is a central

1697
01:08:37.049 --> 01:08:39.356
clerical round table

1698
01:08:39.356 --> 01:08:41.712
that sits, you know, hollow in the center,

1699
01:08:41.712 --> 01:08:43.604
where two individuals will sit facing outward

1700
01:08:43.604 --> 01:08:45.720
that are there for help.

1701
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.688
Since you are with an expositor initially,

1702
01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:49.688
you are not immediately assigned some person

1703
01:08:49.688 --> 01:08:51.927
to be your escort, however, once you break away

1704
01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:54.467
from the expositor, you are under supervision.

1705
01:08:54.467 --> 01:08:55.965
They don't want anyone stealing or running away

1706
01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.369
with any of the books or tomes that are brought here,

1707
01:08:57.369 --> 01:08:59.506
so any person who's here that
isn't a part of the Cobalt Soul

1708
01:08:59.506 --> 01:09:01.593
is constantly under supervision.

1709
01:09:01.593 --> 01:09:04.224
So as you're wandering around, you eventually turn around

1710
01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.716
towards that table,

1711
01:09:05.716 --> 01:09:07.955
and there's already an individual, arms folded,

1712
01:09:07.955 --> 01:09:09.231
just looking at you.

1713
01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:10.261
TALIESIN: Oh, this is great.

1714
01:09:10.261 --> 01:09:13.710
I could actually use some help, if you don't mind.

1715
01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:18.377
MATT: They approach. Appears to be a male half-elf,

1716
01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:24.045
indeterminate age, youngish,

1717
01:09:24.045 --> 01:09:26.611
but hair is cut extremely short,

1718
01:09:27.686 --> 01:09:30.732
the eyes are a dull amber color

1719
01:09:30.732 --> 01:09:33.221
in the iris, and just leans forward.

1720
01:09:33.221 --> 01:09:35.110
"So how can I help you?"

1721
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:38.435
TALIESIN: Hi. I'm so sorry, what was your name?

1722
01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:39.916
MATT: "Oh, Desaund."

1723
01:09:39.916 --> 01:09:41.349
TALIESIN: Desaund, hi, Caduceus.

1724
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:43.693
MATT: "What is your-- Caduceus, all right.

1725
01:09:43.693 --> 01:09:45.233
"What do you need help with?"

1726
01:09:45.233 --> 01:09:47.471
TALIESIN: I've never been in one of these before, really,

1727
01:09:47.471 --> 01:09:50.986
and I've never actually had to look anything up before.

1728
01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:53.892
MATT: "Well, what is it you came here to seek?"

1729
01:09:53.892 --> 01:09:56.154
TALIESIN: I'm looking for information on

1730
01:09:56.154 --> 01:09:58.512
a lesser-known deity,

1731
01:09:58.512 --> 01:10:02.217
or I'm supposed to be going

1732
01:10:02.217 --> 01:10:06.697
to a festival for this deity called the Traveler.

1733
01:10:06.697 --> 01:10:09.940
I've got a date for the event.

1734
01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:14.768
I don't know much about what should be expected,

1735
01:10:14.768 --> 01:10:16.950
and I was curious if it would be possible

1736
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:19.872
to maybe get any information about what I'm walking into.

1737
01:10:19.872 --> 01:10:21.743
MATT: "I cannot say it comes strongly to mind,

1738
01:10:21.743 --> 01:10:24.575
"but I can help you in looking for this research."

1739
01:10:24.575 --> 01:10:26.335
TALIESIN: I've got, like, a basic description,

1740
01:10:26.335 --> 01:10:30.734
I've got the date of the celebration,

1741
01:10:30.734 --> 01:10:33.109
I don't know if it has significance.

1742
01:10:33.109 --> 01:10:36.110
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check for me.

1743
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:38.929
TALIESIN: Oh boy, he's not going to help?

1744
01:10:38.929 --> 01:10:40.812
Okay, that's okay.

1745
01:10:41.854 --> 01:10:44.702
MATT: All of these searches involve help at the library

1746
01:10:44.702 --> 01:10:46.579
if you need it, but this is more of your ability

1747
01:10:46.579 --> 01:10:49.821
to describe elements of this.

1748
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.093
TALIESIN: Natural 19,

1749
01:10:53.093 --> 01:10:54.596
which means 18.

1750
01:10:54.596 --> 01:10:57.478
(laughter)

1751
01:10:57.478 --> 01:10:59.353
MATT: All right.

1752
01:10:59.353 --> 01:11:03.170
With help, you do find some books

1753
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:06.804
specifically about strange occultism.

1754
01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:07.696
TALIESIN: All right.

1755
01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:12.304
MATT: And what are referred to as--

1756
01:11:12.304 --> 01:11:13.362
what would be the phrase?

1757
01:11:13.362 --> 01:11:18.120
It would be rural hearsay of

1758
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.327
neo religions and folklore.

1759
01:11:21.327 --> 01:11:22.493
TALIESIN: Okay.

1760
01:11:22.493 --> 01:11:23.968
I'm a slow reader.

1761
01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:27.520
MATT: It does, it takes you four hours to get through,

1762
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.248
this is all you get.

1763
01:11:30.222 --> 01:11:33.272
But you acquire information that the Traveler

1764
01:11:33.272 --> 01:11:37.770
is essentially a rumored figure

1765
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:42.743
that has begun to show up in rural areas very selectively,

1766
01:11:42.743 --> 01:11:45.119
all the notes, and you do notice,

1767
01:11:45.119 --> 01:11:46.607
because you are an insightful individual,

1768
01:11:46.607 --> 01:11:48.169
that the ink that is written about the Traveler

1769
01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:50.306
is very fresh compared to the rest of it.

1770
01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.040
TALIESIN: -- to be fair, so I know for sure.

1771
01:11:53.424 --> 01:11:57.357
MATT: And most of it speaks of

1772
01:11:57.357 --> 01:11:58.740
worry of it being

1773
01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:03.317
either some sort of devil masquerading as an entity,

1774
01:12:03.317 --> 01:12:07.068
discussion of it being a mass hallucination,

1775
01:12:07.068 --> 01:12:10.381
of it being just a person who is convincing people

1776
01:12:10.381 --> 01:12:13.192
of itself, and it's just a big illusion,

1777
01:12:13.192 --> 01:12:16.570
and some people saying that it's just heresy,

1778
01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:19.124
you know, and people are worshiping something

1779
01:12:19.124 --> 01:12:21.641
much darker and are using this as a front

1780
01:12:21.641 --> 01:12:23.676
when they explain what it is they worship.

1781
01:12:23.676 --> 01:12:25.790
It's fresh enough, and most of these things

1782
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:28.324
are referred to only in like, recent decades.

1783
01:12:28.324 --> 01:12:29.157
TALIESIN: All right.

1784
01:12:29.157 --> 01:12:30.359
LAURA: And then Traveler Con is happening

1785
01:12:30.359 --> 01:12:33.344
on the 26th of Unndilar.
MATT: Like, a decade maybe.

1786
01:12:33.344 --> 01:12:34.629
LAURA: So is there anything special,

1787
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:36.318
were you asking if there's anything special about that day?

1788
01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:38.194
TALIESIN: Yeah, if I was checking a farmer's almanac

1789
01:12:38.194 --> 01:12:40.441
about the 26th of Unndilar, that's a--

1790
01:12:40.441 --> 01:12:41.274
MATT: No.

1791
01:12:44.006 --> 01:12:46.496
Oh, the 26th of Unndilar?

1792
01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.103
That is the Zenith.

1793
01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:51.824
TALIESIN: Oh, so we're having Traveler Con on the Zenith.

1794
01:12:51.824 --> 01:12:55.772
MATT: The Zenith, the highest point during the year

1795
01:12:55.772 --> 01:13:00.597
of the sun's placement in the sky.

1796
01:13:00.597 --> 01:13:04.728
It's considered to be the center point of summer.

1797
01:13:04.728 --> 01:13:08.375
It is generally one of the hotter

1798
01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:11.407
and central, brightest days,

1799
01:13:11.407 --> 01:13:15.588
and it signifies that midpoint between the depth of winter

1800
01:13:15.588 --> 01:13:16.912
and the other side of the calendar.

1801
01:13:16.912 --> 01:13:19.772
(Marisha laughing)
TALIESIN: Gotcha.

1802
01:13:19.772 --> 01:13:21.570
SAM: Our butts are going to be so tanned.

1803
01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:22.695
Our anuses.

1804
01:13:22.695 --> 01:13:25.208
TRAVIS: I never thought you laid on
your back with your legs up,

1805
01:13:25.208 --> 01:13:27.281
I thought they ere doing like--
MARISHA: It's a real thing!

1806
01:13:27.281 --> 01:13:29.906
TRAVIS: I thought they were doing, like, upside down Vs.

1807
01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.073
MARISHA: Yeah.

1808
01:13:32.349 --> 01:13:34.129
TALIESIN: The whole squadron.

1809
01:13:34.129 --> 01:13:36.329
(laughter)

1810
01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:38.819
MATT: So that's your research, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Thank you, that'll do.

1811
01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:40.031
I'm good.

1812
01:13:40.031 --> 01:13:41.679
TRAVIS: Squadron!

1813
01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:44.054
(laughter)

1814
01:13:45.274 --> 01:13:46.107
MATT: So.

1815
01:13:47.599 --> 01:13:49.294
Anything else you'd like to accomplish today?

1816
01:13:49.294 --> 01:13:50.525
SAM: No!

1817
01:13:50.525 --> 01:13:53.295
No, we go to sleep and wake up the next day!

1818
01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:54.460
MATT: All right.

1819
01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:56.828
TRAVIS: This is ridiculous.

1820
01:13:56.828 --> 01:13:59.171
MATT: The cat herding continues.

1821
01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:01.967
TRAVIS: I didn't want to learn.
MARISHA: First day back.

1822
01:14:01.967 --> 01:14:03.142
MATT: I know, that's how it is.

1823
01:14:03.142 --> 01:14:06.185
Shake off the holiday.

1824
01:14:06.185 --> 01:14:09.606
So it's been another evening of rest.

1825
01:14:09.606 --> 01:14:10.920
The next day unfolds before you,

1826
01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.090
you gather your stuff is probably available,

1827
01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:15.397
given the scenario.

1828
01:14:15.397 --> 01:14:17.173
Is there anything else that
you wish to be done with the day?

1829
01:14:17.173 --> 01:14:19.936
LIAM: Well, if we're just going to
go through that quick, which is fine--

1830
01:14:19.936 --> 01:14:21.948
MATT: I was asking if everyone was done with the day.

1831
01:14:21.948 --> 01:14:24.187
But if there's something else you want to do, what is it?

1832
01:14:24.187 --> 01:14:26.307
LAURA: Sam fast-forwarded us.

1833
01:14:26.307 --> 01:14:31.307
LIAM: Caleb will, in the evening, in their room,

1834
01:14:31.376 --> 01:14:35.052
will lay out all of what he's figured out so far,

1835
01:14:35.052 --> 01:14:39.435
for Nott's problem, and:

1836
01:14:39.435 --> 01:14:40.876
Come over here, look at this.

1837
01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.396
SAM: Okay.

1838
01:14:42.396 --> 01:14:45.778
LIAM: I have started, I have not made much headway.

1839
01:14:45.778 --> 01:14:50.009
I did a good bit of work yesterday.

1840
01:14:50.009 --> 01:14:53.059
I have not forgotten, it is going to take

1841
01:14:53.059 --> 01:14:56.030
time for me to understand this, if at all.

1842
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:58.233
SAM: Is there anything I can do to speed up the process,

1843
01:14:58.233 --> 01:15:00.874
or clarify things?

1844
01:15:00.874 --> 01:15:02.814
LIAM: Do you want to have a look at it?

1845
01:15:02.814 --> 01:15:04.012
SAM: Sure.

1846
01:15:04.012 --> 01:15:04.851
Yes.

1847
01:15:04.851 --> 01:15:08.275
LIAM: I cannot solve this.
I don't know what this means here.

1848
01:15:08.275 --> 01:15:11.071
This symbol inside these two circles.

1849
01:15:11.071 --> 01:15:12.677
SAM: Oh, let me take a look.

1850
01:15:12.677 --> 01:15:15.585
I've been around some books.

1851
01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:19.426
MATT: So do you guys spend, like, the remainder of the day

1852
01:15:19.426 --> 01:15:21.191
together working through it?
LIAM: I would say like

1853
01:15:21.191 --> 01:15:24.025
nighttime, stay up a couple hours. Not even a ton.

1854
01:15:24.025 --> 01:15:25.999
MATT: Okay.

1855
01:15:25.999 --> 01:15:28.050
So either you can both make arcana checks,

1856
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:29.580
or one of you can make it with advantage.

1857
01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.334
Your call.

1858
01:15:31.334 --> 01:15:32.459
SAM: Both.

1859
01:15:32.459 --> 01:15:33.862
LIAM: Both, yeah.

1860
01:15:37.263 --> 01:15:39.046
SAM: Use that luck.

1861
01:15:39.046 --> 01:15:40.448
14.
LIAM: 17.

1862
01:15:40.448 --> 01:15:42.132
MATT: 17, okay.

1863
01:15:44.036 --> 01:15:45.894
With Nott's help,

1864
01:15:45.894 --> 01:15:50.257
you do break past that one barrier

1865
01:15:50.257 --> 01:15:52.394
that's been keeping you from advancing

1866
01:15:52.394 --> 01:15:55.868
on one of the broken elements of this extensive equation.

1867
01:15:56.727 --> 01:15:58.562
Kind of with loose improvisation,

1868
01:15:58.562 --> 01:16:00.849
you are such a structured-minded individual,

1869
01:16:00.849 --> 01:16:04.282
that it's through Nott's haphazard barreling through it

1870
01:16:04.282 --> 01:16:05.715
that it ends up teaching you

1871
01:16:05.715 --> 01:16:09.908
a bit of going with the natural flow of this equation,

1872
01:16:09.908 --> 01:16:13.199
and in doing so, you do advance quite a bit.

1873
01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:15.051
I'd say by the end of the evening, both of you

1874
01:16:15.051 --> 01:16:18.809
working together, you're making some good headway.

1875
01:16:18.809 --> 01:16:23.400
You don't know how long, how much more time

1876
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.160
you would need, necessarily.

1877
01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.122
Of course, if this was all done in, like, a research facility

1878
01:16:30.122 --> 01:16:31.690
or a chamber that was designed

1879
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:35.984
specifically for the inscribing and creation

1880
01:16:35.984 --> 01:16:40.435
of, you know, arcane scripture, if you will.

1881
01:16:40.435 --> 01:16:42.078
Scripture's not the right word.

1882
01:16:42.078 --> 01:16:44.840
Inscriptions and designs, this would be a lot quicker,

1883
01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.824
but you're doing this in the midst of a room,

1884
01:16:46.824 --> 01:16:48.456
so it's taking longer than anticipated.

1885
01:16:48.456 --> 01:16:49.634
But you're making some decent headway.

1886
01:16:49.634 --> 01:16:52.391
It's starting to take form and you're starting to see

1887
01:16:52.391 --> 01:16:54.616
the patterns taking shape,

1888
01:16:54.616 --> 01:16:56.764
and you're getting excited.

1889
01:16:57.806 --> 01:17:02.242
LIAM: Thank you, I was being a little too literal,

1890
01:17:02.242 --> 01:17:03.743
a little too straight-on.

1891
01:17:03.743 --> 01:17:08.201
SAM: Well, I helped Yeza with his

1892
01:17:08.201 --> 01:17:09.834
problems sometimes.

1893
01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:12.848
Always good to have an extra set of eyes on things.

1894
01:17:12.848 --> 01:17:15.515
LIAM: Yeah, always.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

1895
01:17:15.515 --> 01:17:17.195
LIAM: Lucky man.

1896
01:17:17.195 --> 01:17:18.911
We'll get you back to him.

1897
01:17:18.911 --> 01:17:19.911
SAM: I hope so.

1898
01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.341
You still feel okay being in this town?

1899
01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:28.308
Near people you used to know?

1900
01:17:30.296 --> 01:17:33.511
LIAM: Not really.

1901
01:17:33.511 --> 01:17:36.108
It is hard to be here.

1902
01:17:36.108 --> 01:17:39.395
There's many things I'd like to see here,

1903
01:17:39.395 --> 01:17:44.395
but all of it's tinged with a bit of hurt, so.

1904
01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.401
I'm looking forward to leave.

1905
01:17:47.401 --> 01:17:51.405
SAM: You don't want to go talk to Eodwulf and,

1906
01:17:51.405 --> 01:17:53.419
what was her name?
LIAM: Astrid.

1907
01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:54.995
SAM: Oh, yeah.

1908
01:17:54.995 --> 01:17:57.975
You don't want to go talk to her?

1909
01:17:57.975 --> 01:18:02.551
LIAM: I'm not exactly sure what
I would say to either of them.

1910
01:18:04.234 --> 01:18:06.901
I don't have a good sense of it.

1911
01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:11.794
Some wounds heal, some don't.

1912
01:18:11.794 --> 01:18:12.627
SAM: Yeah.

1913
01:18:14.049 --> 01:18:17.749
Well, if you wanted to go visit either,

1914
01:18:17.749 --> 01:18:21.191
you know, I'll back you up.

1915
01:18:21.191 --> 01:18:25.116
LIAM: Why don't we, maybe we turn in and get

1916
01:18:25.116 --> 01:18:29.104
a good night's rest, and try to do something

1917
01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:32.604
useful tomorrow, and maybe when we return.

1918
01:18:35.068 --> 01:18:36.151
SAM: Good night.

1919
01:18:39.411 --> 01:18:44.402
LIAM: I pull her into sort of a slow, awkward hug.

1920
01:18:46.297 --> 01:18:47.380
SAM: I hug back.

1921
01:18:50.527 --> 01:18:55.044
LIAM: Thank you for coming with me so far.

1922
01:18:56.312 --> 01:19:01.312
SAM: Well, thank you for going this far.

1923
01:19:01.505 --> 01:19:06.480
I know it's hard to be here,

1924
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.305
but I'm proud of you, you know?

1925
01:19:10.063 --> 01:19:13.882
You won't ever get, you know, fully better

1926
01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:17.365
unless you confront these things.

1927
01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:24.488
So it's a step, and you should be proud of yourself, too.

1928
01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.699
LIAM: What about you, you still want this?

1929
01:19:27.699 --> 01:19:30.434
This road?
SAM: Of course, of course.

1930
01:19:30.434 --> 01:19:32.954
LIAM: No, I know this.
SAM: Oh.

1931
01:19:32.954 --> 01:19:35.604
LIAM: But everything else.

1932
01:19:37.522 --> 01:19:38.460
SAM: Yeah, I mean--

1933
01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:41.310
LIAM: All of this travel and danger.

1934
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:46.310
SAM: The danger and the travel,
it distracts me an awful lot,

1935
01:19:46.644 --> 01:19:48.566
which is good.

1936
01:19:48.566 --> 01:19:53.566
So it's either I find the distraction

1937
01:19:53.882 --> 01:19:58.357
at the bottom of a bottle, or

1938
01:19:58.357 --> 01:20:01.573
in adrenaline-fueled danger,

1939
01:20:01.573 --> 01:20:05.889
or I have to go back and

1940
01:20:05.889 --> 01:20:07.272
think about it more.

1941
01:20:07.272 --> 01:20:09.951
LIAM: And if all of this works?

1942
01:20:11.491 --> 01:20:13.491
That will change things?

1943
01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:18.721
SAM: I guess it will.

1944
01:20:22.005 --> 01:20:23.039
I'll be happy.
LIAM: Insight check.

1945
01:20:23.039 --> 01:20:24.264
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Can I just ask,

1946
01:20:24.264 --> 01:20:25.705
while the insight check is happening,

1947
01:20:25.705 --> 01:20:27.265
has this whole conversation been happening

1948
01:20:27.265 --> 01:20:28.358
while you guys have been hugging?

1949
01:20:28.358 --> 01:20:29.216
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

1950
01:20:29.216 --> 01:20:30.449
We're still in a hug.
LAURA: Okay, I'm just making sure

1951
01:20:30.449 --> 01:20:31.734
that you're still really close.

1952
01:20:31.734 --> 01:20:33.194
LIAM: We're sunning our butts.

1953
01:20:34.244 --> 01:20:35.949
LAURA: I'm just trying to get the feel.

1954
01:20:35.949 --> 01:20:37.503
LIAM: So, you know.

1955
01:20:37.503 --> 01:20:39.909
SAM and LAURA: (laughing)

1956
01:20:39.909 --> 01:20:42.927
MATT: Catching moonlight, at this stage of the day.

1957
01:20:42.927 --> 01:20:44.820
TRAVIS: Is that real, too?

1958
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.123
LIAM: Why couldn't I roll that high before?

1959
01:20:47.123 --> 01:20:48.926
That is a 27.

1960
01:20:48.926 --> 01:20:51.579
SAM: Oh. (laughs)

1961
01:20:51.579 --> 01:20:54.215
I mean, I think you get a sense from Nott

1962
01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:59.106
that she is very scared of what

1963
01:21:01.973 --> 01:21:05.548
the future may hold for her

1964
01:21:05.548 --> 01:21:08.799
if we continue down this path.

1965
01:21:14.517 --> 01:21:17.684
LIAM: Well, pulling out the silver thread.

1966
01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:19.616
Good night.

1967
01:21:24.635 --> 01:21:25.901
I turn in.

1968
01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:26.734
SAM: Me too.

1969
01:21:29.268 --> 01:21:32.231
MATT: You guys all rest for the evening,

1970
01:21:32.231 --> 01:21:36.889
take the fourth day, since you've left the throne room

1971
01:21:36.889 --> 01:21:37.872
of the king.

1972
01:21:37.872 --> 01:21:39.510
LAURA: I thought it was the third day now.

1973
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:41.984
I thought it was just the third day.

1974
01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:43.704
MATT: No, you guys took one day to talk to Ludinus

1975
01:21:43.704 --> 01:21:46.273
before that and everything.

1976
01:21:46.273 --> 01:21:48.601
Second day was the day leading up to the fight,

1977
01:21:48.601 --> 01:21:49.997
third day was yesterday, today's the fourth day.

1978
01:21:49.997 --> 01:21:51.494
I believe I have that math right.

1979
01:21:51.494 --> 01:21:54.090
I don't know, it's been since the holidays.

1980
01:21:55.207 --> 01:22:00.207
So. You guys, if you want to, you can go ahead and retrieve,

1981
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:05.650
from the Cryptic Collection and Keona the Keen,

1982
01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:08.295
the jeweled chalice of which you had ordered,

1983
01:22:08.295 --> 01:22:11.905
as well as your bone harp, which looks

1984
01:22:11.905 --> 01:22:16.897
delightfully intimidating for being a harp-like instrument.

1985
01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.315
Its jagged edges, it has this natural curve

1986
01:22:21.315 --> 01:22:24.139
that hooks around.
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

1987
01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:25.722
ASHLEY: And it's made out of a spine?

1988
01:22:25.722 --> 01:22:26.651
MATT: Yeah.

1989
01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:29.667
TRAVIS: Kill somebody with that shit.

1990
01:22:30.501 --> 01:22:34.137
MARISHA: I find a special case of scoliosis for that one.

1991
01:22:34.137 --> 01:22:35.167
ASHLEY: Oh yeah.

1992
01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:37.686
I can relate.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1993
01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:40.353
(laughter)

1994
01:22:44.283 --> 01:22:46.116
Not that that means...

1995
01:22:50.206 --> 01:22:51.628
I forgot what I was going to say.

1996
01:22:51.628 --> 01:22:54.461
TRAVIS: Nice fucking apology.

1997
01:22:57.276 --> 01:23:01.992
ASHLEY: Can I give it a little, tickle the--

1998
01:23:01.992 --> 01:23:03.779
TRAVIS: Yeah, what do you say about a harp?

1999
01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:06.213
Tickle the strings?
ASHLEY: Tickle the strings?

2000
01:23:06.213 --> 01:23:07.272
Pluck them?

2001
01:23:07.272 --> 01:23:11.447
MATT: It's not tuned, and you get the sense

2002
01:23:11.447 --> 01:23:15.472
that this was built as a collaboration.

2003
01:23:15.472 --> 01:23:17.321
There is the bone work and the craftwork

2004
01:23:17.321 --> 01:23:19.665
to the actual harp itself.

2005
01:23:19.665 --> 01:23:22.609
It is very much in line with a lot of the other sculpting

2006
01:23:22.609 --> 01:23:25.076
and designs of the chamber that you're in,

2007
01:23:25.076 --> 01:23:27.273
but the strings and a lot of the more

2008
01:23:27.273 --> 01:23:29.318
instrumental part of it have a more delicate touch

2009
01:23:29.318 --> 01:23:31.764
in their design, and Keona even, you know,

2010
01:23:31.764 --> 01:23:34.150
mentions to you the fact that this was,

2011
01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:37.805
the music element of it was an actual musician,

2012
01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:39.388
but it's not tuned.

2013
01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:42.643
It sounds beautiful.

2014
01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:43.939
Haunting, almost.

2015
01:23:43.939 --> 01:23:45.116
And there's an interesting element,

2016
01:23:45.116 --> 01:23:47.336
because some of the bones themselves are hollow,

2017
01:23:47.336 --> 01:23:48.978
some of the notes that you play,

2018
01:23:48.978 --> 01:23:50.989
it gives this resonant vibration

2019
01:23:50.989 --> 01:23:55.188
that completely bores through the entirety of the harp

2020
01:23:55.188 --> 01:23:58.905
and gives this weird reverberation to the sound

2021
01:23:58.905 --> 01:24:01.392
that normally wouldn't be there.

2022
01:24:01.392 --> 01:24:03.059
It's almost ghostly.

2023
01:24:04.522 --> 01:24:08.601
ASHLEY: This is one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.

2024
01:24:08.601 --> 01:24:11.300
MATT: "Well, I'm glad to hear that."

2025
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.118
ASHLEY: You really just went above and beyond to make this

2026
01:24:14.118 --> 01:24:17.546
just such a beautiful instrument.

2027
01:24:17.546 --> 01:24:20.346
MATT: "Well, make me proud."

2028
01:24:21.747 --> 01:24:23.735
TRAVIS: Creepy-ass hands.
SAM: Oh, the hands.

2029
01:24:23.735 --> 01:24:25.044
ASHLEY: Do you want to try playing it?

2030
01:24:25.044 --> 01:24:27.755
You probably already have.

2031
01:24:27.755 --> 01:24:28.838
MATT: "Oh, I have."

2032
01:24:30.714 --> 01:24:32.264
ASHLEY: Can I hear?

2033
01:24:33.259 --> 01:24:36.126
MATT: "I'm bashful about it."

2034
01:24:36.126 --> 01:24:40.039
(laughter)

2035
01:24:40.039 --> 01:24:42.016
ASHLEY: I understand.

2036
01:24:42.016 --> 01:24:43.741
MATT: "But your chalice."

2037
01:24:43.741 --> 01:24:45.408
LAURA: Thank you.

2038
01:24:46.434 --> 01:24:47.267
(slurping)

2039
01:24:47.267 --> 01:24:49.665
Mm, it's so fancy, thank you.

2040
01:24:49.665 --> 01:24:51.588
TRAVIS: Did you imaginary sip out of that cup?

2041
01:24:51.588 --> 01:24:53.495
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2042
01:24:53.495 --> 01:24:56.145
LAURA: What else are you going to
do with a fancy-ass chalice?

2043
01:24:56.145 --> 01:24:57.384
TALIESIN: Ice cubes and zinfandel.

2044
01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:59.304
MATT: It's essentially a pimp cup.

2045
01:24:59.304 --> 01:25:02.978
Jester's got a pimp cup, it's pretty great.

2046
01:25:02.978 --> 01:25:05.132
LAURA: I'm going to eat ice cream out of it.

2047
01:25:05.132 --> 01:25:06.926
MATT: All right, so you go ahead and--

2048
01:25:06.926 --> 01:25:08.396
MARISHA: Perfect sundae size.

2049
01:25:08.396 --> 01:25:09.991
Fuck, you're right.

2050
01:25:09.991 --> 01:25:13.968
MATT: You find an ice cream-esque Rexxentrum treat,

2051
01:25:13.968 --> 01:25:15.856
which is challenging, given the current

2052
01:25:15.856 --> 01:25:17.854
gray, cold weather that seems to have taken

2053
01:25:17.854 --> 01:25:21.199
most of the environment, but it's available.

2054
01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:24.546
LAURA: Is it like in a little cart vendor,
or is it like a store?

2055
01:25:24.546 --> 01:25:26.512
MATT: You're actually going to have to request it,

2056
01:25:26.512 --> 01:25:28.447
it's more of just like a frozen cream,

2057
01:25:28.447 --> 01:25:31.287
that someone has to repurpose for the specifics

2058
01:25:31.287 --> 01:25:32.707
of what you're requesting.

2059
01:25:32.707 --> 01:25:35.020
LIAM: It's just cheese on ice.
MATT: Kind of, kind of.

2060
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.615
(laughter)

2061
01:25:37.615 --> 01:25:39.278
TALIESIN: Ice cheese.
LAURA: Put it in here.

2062
01:25:39.278 --> 01:25:42.243
But don't take it, I'm going to just--

2063
01:25:42.243 --> 01:25:43.610
TALIESIN: Ah.

2064
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:46.277
(Matt slurping)

2065
01:25:47.218 --> 01:25:48.822
(continues slurping)

2066
01:25:48.822 --> 01:25:50.313
There's another phrase that's never been said.

2067
01:25:50.313 --> 01:25:52.298
MATT: "More of it?"

2068
01:25:52.298 --> 01:25:54.539
TALIESIN: "Fill my chalice with ice cheese."

2069
01:25:54.539 --> 01:25:56.663
(Matt slurping)

2070
01:25:56.663 --> 01:25:58.376
SAM: How many scoops?

2071
01:25:58.376 --> 01:25:59.425
LAURA: Six scoops.

2072
01:25:59.425 --> 01:26:00.615
SAM: (laughs)

2073
01:26:00.615 --> 01:26:01.979
LAURA: Thank you.

2074
01:26:01.979 --> 01:26:03.619
(Matt chuckles)

2075
01:26:03.619 --> 01:26:05.284
(Laura laughing)

2076
01:26:05.284 --> 01:26:08.766
Well, it's a big chalice, it fills-- you know.

2077
01:26:08.766 --> 01:26:11.296
MATT: Best use of a jeweled chalice.

2078
01:26:12.571 --> 01:26:14.576
Is there anything else anyone wants to accomplish

2079
01:26:14.576 --> 01:26:15.488
in the morning, or--

2080
01:26:15.488 --> 01:26:17.254
MARISHA: Hey, how was that spa?

2081
01:26:17.254 --> 01:26:21.262
TRAVIS: I mean, I feel like a new half-orc.

2082
01:26:21.262 --> 01:26:23.695
MARISHA: Did you still want to
do that before we like--

2083
01:26:23.695 --> 01:26:25.196
spa and then go?

2084
01:26:25.196 --> 01:26:27.778
TALIESIN: Do you want to go read in the spa?
ASHLEY: Yeah, I could go read at the spa.

2085
01:26:27.778 --> 01:26:29.949
Your skin looks quite beautiful.

2086
01:26:29.949 --> 01:26:31.859
TALIESIN: You're glowing.
ASHLEY: Yeah, it has a glow.

2087
01:26:31.859 --> 01:26:35.321
LAURA: It looks like you've got a little bit of stubble

2088
01:26:35.321 --> 01:26:36.387
coming in there.

2089
01:26:36.387 --> 01:26:38.844
TRAVIS: No, it's really nice, they have, like, hot towels

2090
01:26:38.844 --> 01:26:41.673
and it was nice.

2091
01:26:41.673 --> 01:26:43.116
LAURA: Wow.
TRAVIS: Yep.

2092
01:26:43.116 --> 01:26:45.701
ASHLEY: Do they have, like, mud baths and things like that?

2093
01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.230
TRAVIS: I did not ask.

2094
01:26:47.230 --> 01:26:48.218
ASHLEY: Ah.

2095
01:26:48.218 --> 01:26:49.234
TRAVIS: But I bet they do.

2096
01:26:49.234 --> 01:26:50.984
How hard could it be?

2097
01:26:52.151 --> 01:26:54.963
ASHLEY: I guess anywhere could be a mud bath.

2098
01:26:54.963 --> 01:26:56.884
TRAVIS: Is that a spa treatment?

2099
01:26:56.884 --> 01:26:57.717
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2100
01:26:57.717 --> 01:26:58.550
TRAVIS: Oh.

2101
01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:00.930
ASHLEY: I mean, it was where I'm from.

2102
01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:02.509
TRAVIS: You pay for that?

2103
01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:03.892
ASHLEY: Yeah, we would just roll around in it

2104
01:27:03.892 --> 01:27:06.688
and it's supposed to be really good for your skin.

2105
01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:08.063
TRAVIS: Weird.

2106
01:27:09.813 --> 01:27:11.597
Let's try that.

2107
01:27:11.597 --> 01:27:12.865
LAURA: You're going to go back?

2108
01:27:12.865 --> 01:27:14.903
TRAVIS: Spa day number two.

2109
01:27:14.903 --> 01:27:16.031
Look at my beard!

2110
01:27:16.031 --> 01:27:20.391
LAURA: I mean, it's-- I don't call it--
LIAM: Well, "beard" is a stretch.

2111
01:27:20.391 --> 01:27:21.986
TRAVIS: I mean, look, it's real--

2112
01:27:21.986 --> 01:27:23.841
(Marisha groans)
It hurts, right?

2113
01:27:23.841 --> 01:27:25.154
I mean, it's really there.

2114
01:27:25.154 --> 01:27:26.946
MARISHA: You actually, you got a
dry patch, thank you.

2115
01:27:26.946 --> 01:27:27.909
Yeah.

2116
01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:29.617
(Matt laughing)

2117
01:27:29.617 --> 01:27:31.568
(Marisha laughing)

2118
01:27:31.568 --> 01:27:33.254
TALIESIN: With that, I think we all need a spa day.

2119
01:27:33.254 --> 01:27:35.595
(laughter)

2120
01:27:35.595 --> 01:27:38.478
LAURA: But before we go, I wanted to share my ice cream

2121
01:27:38.478 --> 01:27:42.580
with the Traveler, and ask him about Traveler Con,

2122
01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.413
if I could.

2123
01:27:43.413 --> 01:27:46.108
MATT: All right, and how, do you wish to like--

2124
01:27:46.108 --> 01:27:48.201
LAURA: I'm going to go find a nice quiet, you know,

2125
01:27:48.201 --> 01:27:50.764
patch on the grass or something if we're out,

2126
01:27:50.764 --> 01:27:52.641
and I'm going to sit down with my ice cream,

2127
01:27:52.641 --> 01:27:54.265
and I'm going to--

2128
01:27:54.265 --> 01:27:55.980
MARISHA: Just wander off mid-walk.

2129
01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:57.749
LAURA: Yeah, while you're talking about the spa.

2130
01:27:57.749 --> 01:27:59.586
MARISHA: Jester-- Jes. Jes?

2131
01:27:59.586 --> 01:28:02.057
LAURA: I'm just going to, you know,
concentrate on my symbol

2132
01:28:02.057 --> 01:28:05.793
and say: Traveler, I got some ice cream for us,

2133
01:28:05.793 --> 01:28:08.641
if you want to talk about Traveler Con,

2134
01:28:08.641 --> 01:28:11.354
because you know, there are some interesting questions

2135
01:28:11.354 --> 01:28:13.415
coming up, and I realize I don't have the answers,

2136
01:28:13.415 --> 01:28:15.724
and so, you know.

2137
01:28:17.299 --> 01:28:18.760
MATT: So you guys all wait and stare at Jester?

2138
01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.667
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2139
01:28:19.667 --> 01:28:21.514
(laughter)

2140
01:28:21.514 --> 01:28:22.490
TALIESIN: Just let this happen.

2141
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:25.183
ASHLEY: I'm going to sit and tinker with the harp.

2142
01:28:25.183 --> 01:28:26.667
Play some Hot Cross Buns.

2143
01:28:26.667 --> 01:28:28.168
MATT: Yeah. Make a performance check.

2144
01:28:28.168 --> 01:28:29.176
ASHLEY: Oh.

2145
01:28:29.176 --> 01:28:32.245
LAURA: Ooh, maybe it will inspire the Traveler.

2146
01:28:32.245 --> 01:28:33.441
ASHLEY: Oh, natural 20.

2147
01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:34.641
LIAM: Yes!
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2148
01:28:34.641 --> 01:28:36.744
MATT: Plus your performance, which is...?
LAURA: Fuck yeah!

2149
01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:39.134
ASHLEY: Performance probably is a minus two.

2150
01:28:39.134 --> 01:28:39.987
LAURA: Aww.

2151
01:28:39.987 --> 01:28:40.828
MATT: So 18.

2152
01:28:40.828 --> 01:28:41.943
LAURA: But natural 20.

2153
01:28:41.943 --> 01:28:44.938
MATT: For skills, natural 20s aren't really a thing.

2154
01:28:44.938 --> 01:28:45.933
MARISHA: Lies.

2155
01:28:45.933 --> 01:28:47.075
(Laura laughs)

2156
01:28:47.075 --> 01:28:48.503
MATT: No, handbook.

2157
01:28:48.503 --> 01:28:50.849
(laughter)

2158
01:28:50.849 --> 01:28:51.927
LAURA: Damn.

2159
01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:53.857
TALIESIN: Handbook is just a
lie that's been written down.

2160
01:28:53.857 --> 01:28:55.637
(laughter)

2161
01:28:55.637 --> 01:28:58.592
ASHLEY: Never be above 18 in performance.

2162
01:28:58.592 --> 01:29:00.028
MATT: But I take it, for the cool factor of it,

2163
01:29:00.028 --> 01:29:01.619
I take it into account.

2164
01:29:01.619 --> 01:29:04.763
So even though you've never,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

2165
01:29:04.763 --> 01:29:07.661
really spent time with a harp previously,

2166
01:29:07.661 --> 01:29:08.884
an instrument that maybe from afar

2167
01:29:08.884 --> 01:29:11.600
you've, you know, appreciated,

2168
01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.375
you, while not really finding a melody,

2169
01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:18.160
the sound itself is clean,
and you tune it as you go

2170
01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.874
the best to your ear, and while doesn't produce

2171
01:29:20.874 --> 01:29:24.589
a consistent melody, the sound itself is...

2172
01:29:24.589 --> 01:29:29.505
still clear and beautiful.

2173
01:29:29.505 --> 01:29:31.523
And even as you guys wait,

2174
01:29:31.523 --> 01:29:36.139
you are taken off guard
by the sight of Yasha,

2175
01:29:36.139 --> 01:29:41.116
this powerful dark figure
that has gone through

2176
01:29:41.116 --> 01:29:43.900
and endured so much in recent time,

2177
01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:46.802
sitting here amongst the
edge of the grass in Rexxentrum,

2178
01:29:46.802 --> 01:29:50.349
under a faintly cloud-covered sky,

2179
01:29:50.349 --> 01:29:53.754
and just improvising this beautiful sound

2180
01:29:53.754 --> 01:29:56.520
from this instrument, as
Jester watches her ice cream

2181
01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.668
slowly melt into a cup,
as the rest of her friends

2182
01:30:00.668 --> 01:30:04.668
stare impatiently, waiting for her to join them.

2183
01:30:06.873 --> 01:30:07.974
LAURA: He doesn't come?

2184
01:30:07.974 --> 01:30:08.807
MATT: No.

2185
01:30:10.303 --> 01:30:12.470
TRAVIS: He's lactose intolerant.

2186
01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:15.501
LAURA: Oh no.

2187
01:30:18.976 --> 01:30:19.809
Oh no!

2188
01:30:24.277 --> 01:30:25.560
The Traveler--

2189
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.727
SAM: You okay?

2190
01:30:28.651 --> 01:30:31.189
LAURA: I don't think he likes ice cream!

2191
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:33.219
SAM: Who doesn't like ice cream?

2192
01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:36.461
LAURA: I don't-- I've never met anyone.

2193
01:30:36.461 --> 01:30:39.811
TALIESIN: Maybe he's busy making lanyards and--

2194
01:30:39.811 --> 01:30:41.710
SAM: Yeah, maybe he's getting ready.
LAURA: Oh my gosh, he's so busy.

2195
01:30:41.710 --> 01:30:43.581
Maybe he's mad at me because it took me so long

2196
01:30:43.581 --> 01:30:46.031
to ask him these questions.

2197
01:30:46.031 --> 01:30:47.415
MARISHA: It's also, like, a biggie--

2198
01:30:47.415 --> 01:30:49.635
a biggie-- it's a biggie park.

2199
01:30:49.635 --> 01:30:50.752
It's a busy park.

2200
01:30:50.752 --> 01:30:52.035
TRAVIS: Whoa.

2201
01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:55.935
Knock them bubbles loose.

2202
01:30:55.935 --> 01:30:57.403
LAURA: Okay, snea snake.

2203
01:30:57.403 --> 01:31:02.403
(laughter)

2204
01:31:02.745 --> 01:31:03.970
MARISHA: Yeah.

2205
01:31:05.034 --> 01:31:06.957
LIAM: Walked right into that one.

2206
01:31:06.957 --> 01:31:08.110
MATT: Fatality.

2207
01:31:08.110 --> 01:31:10.131
TRAVIS: Ooper Dooper!

2208
01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:12.200
(laughter)

2209
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.708
SAM: I'm sure he likes ice cream,
he just, you know,

2210
01:31:17.664 --> 01:31:21.234
it's not hot where he is or something.

2211
01:31:21.234 --> 01:31:23.871
LAURA: He's normally here, he's normally here.

2212
01:31:23.871 --> 01:31:27.704
It's wherever I am, it's the same where he is.

2213
01:31:32.539 --> 01:31:35.197
LIAM: Caduceus, correct me if
I'm wrong, but sometimes...

2214
01:31:36.497 --> 01:31:38.668
I don't know what I'm talking about,

2215
01:31:38.668 --> 01:31:42.485
the gods reveal things,

2216
01:31:42.485 --> 01:31:45.652
and sometimes they wish

2217
01:31:45.652 --> 01:31:49.892
their flock to find the answer, or so I have read.

2218
01:31:49.892 --> 01:31:51.466
LAURA: Huh?

2219
01:31:51.466 --> 01:31:55.465
LIAM: Maybe he means for you
to find this answer yourself.

2220
01:31:55.465 --> 01:31:57.408
SAM: Or you don't have any
responsibilities at Traveler Con,

2221
01:31:57.408 --> 01:31:59.935
he wants you to just be a guest.

2222
01:31:59.935 --> 01:32:00.931
MATT: And enjoy yourself.

2223
01:32:00.931 --> 01:32:02.542
SAM: Yeah, because you're so special.

2224
01:32:02.542 --> 01:32:04.125
LIAM: And be surprised.

2225
01:32:05.105 --> 01:32:08.047
MARISHA: Or maybe the answer will reveal itself

2226
01:32:08.047 --> 01:32:10.788
in a hot tub at the spa!

2227
01:32:11.749 --> 01:32:13.736
LAURA: Maybe he wants to go to the spa.

2228
01:32:13.736 --> 01:32:15.290
MARISHA: Spas are dope.

2229
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:16.826
TRAVIS: He doesn't want cold.

2230
01:32:16.826 --> 01:32:19.876
ASHLEY: Maybe he's trying to
watch his figure before the Con.

2231
01:32:21.134 --> 01:32:23.408
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2232
01:32:23.408 --> 01:32:25.181
TALIESIN: That's a lot of dairy.

2233
01:32:25.181 --> 01:32:27.066
LAURA: That is a lot of dairy.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2234
01:32:27.066 --> 01:32:27.899
LAURA: Yeah.

2235
01:32:27.899 --> 01:32:29.429
SAM: That's coming from a cow.

2236
01:32:29.429 --> 01:32:30.867
LAURA: Okay, well--

2237
01:32:31.967 --> 01:32:35.209
Now it's six scoops of melted cream.

2238
01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:38.191
I'm just going to sip it as we go to the spa.

2239
01:32:38.191 --> 01:32:40.295
SAM: You should definitely eat it, I mean, you bought it.

2240
01:32:40.295 --> 01:32:41.514
I bought you a present.

2241
01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:42.347
LAURA: You did?

2242
01:32:42.347 --> 01:32:45.412
SAM: Yes, I bought you these cards that you can

2243
01:32:45.412 --> 01:32:47.245
turn into tarot cards.

2244
01:32:50.056 --> 01:32:51.470
LAURA: Thank you, Nott.

2245
01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:54.146
SAM: Well, you know, I don't know how many you need,

2246
01:32:54.146 --> 01:32:55.765
so I got, like, 60.

2247
01:32:55.765 --> 01:32:57.730
LAURA: Wow, I don't know
how many you're supposed to--

2248
01:32:57.730 --> 01:32:59.605
you know what, I bet I can cut them down,

2249
01:32:59.605 --> 01:33:02.891
because look, these are the ones that Molly had.
SAM: Those are smaller, yeah.

2250
01:33:02.891 --> 01:33:04.894
LAURA: They're a little smaller, but you know

2251
01:33:04.894 --> 01:33:07.303
there's some blank ones in here?

2252
01:33:07.303 --> 01:33:09.482
I think Molly was making his own deck.

2253
01:33:09.482 --> 01:33:11.504
SAM: Well, maybe you can make your own deck.

2254
01:33:11.504 --> 01:33:13.993
LAURA: Well, maybe I can add on, and maybe we can have

2255
01:33:13.993 --> 01:33:15.774
like a joint deck.

2256
01:33:15.774 --> 01:33:17.491
I wonder how many cards there's supposed to be.

2257
01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:20.047
SAM: I think it's the more, the merrier with tarot.

2258
01:33:20.047 --> 01:33:23.247
LAURA: Probably, right?
SAM: I think you should have like, as many as you can.

2259
01:33:23.247 --> 01:33:26.148
LAURA: Like, just keep adding to it over time, and then--

2260
01:33:26.148 --> 01:33:28.702
SAM: As many as the human condition.

2261
01:33:28.702 --> 01:33:30.070
LAURA: That's so smart.

2262
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:32.948
Maybe you should read, that sounds like--

2263
01:33:32.948 --> 01:33:35.833
you know, you have a natural inclination

2264
01:33:35.833 --> 01:33:37.247
to being able to read people.

2265
01:33:37.247 --> 01:33:39.058
SAM: I could help you with it, if you'd like.

2266
01:33:39.058 --> 01:33:40.517
LAURA: I would love that, Nott.

2267
01:33:40.517 --> 01:33:43.107
SAM: I can at least come up with
some imagery to put on them.

2268
01:33:43.107 --> 01:33:44.583
LAURA: I love that, thank you.

2269
01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:46.294
SAM: All right.

2270
01:33:46.294 --> 01:33:47.904
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: I regret everything.

2271
01:33:47.904 --> 01:33:49.511
MATT: (laughs)

2272
01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:53.939
You guys make your way towards the Silvered Sunset Oasis.

2273
01:33:53.939 --> 01:33:57.813
Along the way, a voice calls out from amongst the

2274
01:33:57.813 --> 01:34:02.813
decent bustle of the streets here in Rexxentrum, goes,

2275
01:34:03.313 --> 01:34:05.103
"Hey!

2276
01:34:05.103 --> 01:34:06.473
"Hey.

2277
01:34:06.473 --> 01:34:08.470
"Fjord, was it, huh?"

2278
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:09.807
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2279
01:34:10.948 --> 01:34:14.012
MATT: Looking around and see
Darrow Allocke running up to you.

2280
01:34:14.012 --> 01:34:15.368
LAURA: Yes!
TALIESIN: Yay.

2281
01:34:15.368 --> 01:34:18.251
MATT: He goes, (chuckling) "Hey there, friend.

2282
01:34:18.251 --> 01:34:20.633
"I am so happy to see you.

2283
01:34:20.633 --> 01:34:23.266
"I just have to tell you, like,

2284
01:34:25.527 --> 01:34:27.575
"that was a good fight.

2285
01:34:27.575 --> 01:34:30.241
"I feel kind of bad.

2286
01:34:31.178 --> 01:34:33.454
"That was a stroke of luck.

2287
01:34:33.454 --> 01:34:36.630
"I mean, I'm not going to lie, I've done quite a few battles

2288
01:34:36.630 --> 01:34:40.706
"in my day, and that was, whew, strike true, right?"

2289
01:34:40.706 --> 01:34:42.083
TRAVIS: Quite the blow.
MATT: "Indeed.

2290
01:34:42.083 --> 01:34:44.489
"You took it like a champ, didn't you?"

2291
01:34:44.489 --> 01:34:45.755
TRAVIS: Yes.

2292
01:34:45.755 --> 01:34:47.030
No, not so much.

2293
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:48.626
I mean, I stayed up.

2294
01:34:48.626 --> 01:34:50.751
MATT: "A champion stands up, am I right?"

2295
01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.882
TRAVIS: Which was important, yes.
MATT: "That was great."

2296
01:34:52.882 --> 01:34:56.236
TRAVIS: You really let me have it.

2297
01:34:56.236 --> 01:34:58.884
I mean, that sucked, a lot.

2298
01:34:58.884 --> 01:35:00.870
MATT: "I understood, and I am just,

2299
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:04.035
"could I like, I don't know, buy you, like, a corndog

2300
01:35:04.035 --> 01:35:06.319
"or something to make it up to you?

2301
01:35:06.319 --> 01:35:08.317
"I've been thinking about it for a few days.

2302
01:35:08.317 --> 01:35:10.049
"Because, like, you're nice people and everything,

2303
01:35:10.049 --> 01:35:12.793
"and you're strong, and it was a lucky shot."

2304
01:35:12.793 --> 01:35:14.279
MARISHA: You could buy him a massage.

2305
01:35:14.279 --> 01:35:15.694
We're going to the spa.

2306
01:35:15.694 --> 01:35:17.921
LAURA: Do you want to join us?
MATT: "Oh, to the spa?"

2307
01:35:17.921 --> 01:35:19.345
Checks through his coin purse.

2308
01:35:19.345 --> 01:35:20.371
(Marisha laughing)

2309
01:35:20.371 --> 01:35:21.796
LAURA: (whispering) Is that bad?

2310
01:35:21.796 --> 01:35:23.247
He could go buy you a big--

2311
01:35:23.247 --> 01:35:25.781
MATT: "Yeah, you know what, I've earned it too, why not?"

2312
01:35:25.781 --> 01:35:26.702
MARISHA: Yeah!

2313
01:35:26.702 --> 01:35:28.373
MATT: "I appreciate the invitation."

2314
01:35:28.373 --> 01:35:29.218
TALIESIN: What a good idea.

2315
01:35:29.218 --> 01:35:30.663
MATT: (laughs)

2316
01:35:30.663 --> 01:35:33.215
SAM: Hey Fjord, is this a new
friend of yours? I didn't see the--

2317
01:35:33.215 --> 01:35:36.488
TRAVIS: This is Darrow, this is the gentleman who--

2318
01:35:36.488 --> 01:35:37.581
MARISHA: He kicked his ass at the--

2319
01:35:37.581 --> 01:35:39.009
MATT: "-- sparred with him the other night."

2320
01:35:39.009 --> 01:35:42.407
SAM: I didn't see the fight, I heard it was a rousing fight

2321
01:35:42.407 --> 01:35:44.931
between two equally matched combatants.

2322
01:35:44.931 --> 01:35:46.984
MATT: "Yes, precisely.

2323
01:35:46.984 --> 01:35:49.642
"He has some tricks up his sleeve."
SAM: And now you guys are friends?

2324
01:35:49.642 --> 01:35:52.100
TRAVIS: We've been friends since before.

2325
01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.504
Great admirers of each other's skill, at the very least.

2326
01:35:55.504 --> 01:35:57.209
MATT: "Yes, indeed."
SAM: Sounds great.

2327
01:35:57.209 --> 01:35:59.294
Maybe we should like, let them go by themselves

2328
01:35:59.294 --> 01:36:00.739
or something.

2329
01:36:00.739 --> 01:36:02.222
MARISHA: No, fuck that, I want a massage.

2330
01:36:02.222 --> 01:36:03.122
Let's go.

2331
01:36:03.122 --> 01:36:05.766
TRAVIS: Yes, please join us, it would be an honor.

2332
01:36:05.766 --> 01:36:08.911
It was a fantastic fight, I learned quite a lot from you,

2333
01:36:08.911 --> 01:36:10.119
I have to say.

2334
01:36:10.119 --> 01:36:11.398
MATT: "Well, if you insist."

2335
01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:14.380
TRAVIS: I can only hope to mimic that same sort of skill

2336
01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.479
in encounters ahead.

2337
01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:18.100
Please, join us.

2338
01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:21.729
I was there yest-- I heard someone went there yesterday,

2339
01:36:21.729 --> 01:36:26.234
and the services are supposed to be next level.

2340
01:36:26.234 --> 01:36:27.717
MATT: "I'm not going to lie, it's been probably

2341
01:36:27.717 --> 01:36:29.675
"about two years since I've had a good proper pampering."

2342
01:36:29.675 --> 01:36:32.725
TRAVIS: I couldn't tell you the last time I've been.

2343
01:36:32.725 --> 01:36:34.951
Please, shall we all?

2344
01:36:34.951 --> 01:36:37.074
MARISHA: Yeah, let's.
MATT: "Yes, let's do it, come on.

2345
01:36:37.074 --> 01:36:39.525
"Show the way." (chuckling)
MARISHA: To the spa.

2346
01:36:39.525 --> 01:36:40.982
So, Darrow.
MATT: "Yes?"

2347
01:36:40.982 --> 01:36:43.517
MARISHA: How's time been, you know, with the Stubborn Stock

2348
01:36:43.517 --> 01:36:45.577
since we've seen you last? As we're walking.

2349
01:36:45.577 --> 01:36:46.506
MATT: Yeah, as you're walking.

2350
01:36:46.506 --> 01:36:47.854
"It's been all right.

2351
01:36:47.854 --> 01:36:51.196
"Mercenary work has been paying, you know, fairly well

2352
01:36:51.196 --> 01:36:53.325
"as the conflicts rise.

2353
01:36:53.325 --> 01:36:56.917
"You know, doing a bit of bodyguard work here and there.

2354
01:36:56.917 --> 01:36:59.002
"Found ourselves in Rexxentrum, got a new client,

2355
01:36:59.002 --> 01:37:02.893
"and been trying to, you know, keep ourselves busy."

2356
01:37:02.893 --> 01:37:04.962
SAM: Client? Who's that?
MARISHA: Who's that?

2357
01:37:04.962 --> 01:37:06.668
MATT: "Not really allowed to tell, it's part of the--"

2358
01:37:06.668 --> 01:37:08.470
SAM: Oh, come on, but we're friends, though.

2359
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:10.816
TRAVIS: Trent Ikithon?
MATT: "No, I don't know what that is."

2360
01:37:10.816 --> 01:37:11.649
TRAVIS: Oh.

2361
01:37:11.649 --> 01:37:15.562
(laughter)

2362
01:37:15.562 --> 01:37:19.508
MATT: "But no, it's been good. Just keeping the time,

2363
01:37:19.508 --> 01:37:21.354
"keeping people safe, earning coin,

2364
01:37:21.354 --> 01:37:25.976
"and occasionally getting a little
bout down there, you know,

2365
01:37:25.976 --> 01:37:27.330
"and that's where I saw you guys again."

2366
01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:28.488
TRAVIS: Anything weird?

2367
01:37:28.488 --> 01:37:30.006
I mean, you know, our line of work,

2368
01:37:30.006 --> 01:37:31.497
we can see quite a few weird things,

2369
01:37:31.497 --> 01:37:32.819
but anything out of the ordinary,

2370
01:37:32.819 --> 01:37:34.328
something that you would call remarkable

2371
01:37:34.328 --> 01:37:37.320
or a good story you could share?

2372
01:37:38.607 --> 01:37:40.240
MATT: "How long have you been here?"

2373
01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.503
MARISHA: Four days.

2374
01:37:41.503 --> 01:37:44.079
TRAVIS: Five.
LAURA and MARISHA: Five days.

2375
01:37:44.079 --> 01:37:45.985
SAM: Like, three too many. We're trying to leave.

2376
01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:48.180
(laughter)

2377
01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:49.404
TALIESIN: Since the crazy.

2378
01:37:49.404 --> 01:37:51.105
LAURA: We had to wait for this chalice.

2379
01:37:51.105 --> 01:37:52.910
SAM: And now we're just waiting.

2380
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:54.118
LAURA: Do want some cream?

2381
01:37:54.118 --> 01:37:55.749
MARISHA: Hey, where's my ninja stars?
MATT: "Sure."

2382
01:37:55.749 --> 01:37:57.465
LAURA: So good.

2383
01:37:57.465 --> 01:38:00.670
SAM: You mean these ninja stars?

2384
01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:01.986
Pop, pop!
MARISHA: Ow!

2385
01:38:01.986 --> 01:38:03.824
SAM: I throw them at her.
MARISHA: Ow!

2386
01:38:03.824 --> 01:38:06.464
(laughter)

2387
01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:08.888
MATT: "That's a lot going on there."

2388
01:38:08.888 --> 01:38:10.908
LAURA: It's a lot of cream.

2389
01:38:10.908 --> 01:38:13.006
It's good.

2390
01:38:13.006 --> 01:38:15.696
MATT: "Yeah." (halfhearted laughing) "Thank you."

2391
01:38:15.696 --> 01:38:18.073
LAURA: You're welcome.
TRAVIS: His face goes--

2392
01:38:18.073 --> 01:38:20.209
(laughter)

2393
01:38:20.209 --> 01:38:21.042
Oh god.

2394
01:38:23.057 --> 01:38:25.224
MATT: Conjure EpiPen.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2395
01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:31.305
MATT: "So, strange things?

2396
01:38:32.575 --> 01:38:34.740
"There was this crazy moment in a storm,

2397
01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:37.654
"a few days ago, I think, you may have been here.

2398
01:38:37.654 --> 01:38:39.028
"Suddenly the clouds opened up and this beam

2399
01:38:39.028 --> 01:38:41.813
"of sun came through and I felt the presence

2400
01:38:41.813 --> 01:38:44.957
"of the Dawnfather, there with us in the city,

2401
01:38:44.957 --> 01:38:48.600
"in his light and his glory, I knew it was a sign.

2402
01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:53.160
"It was a sign that we were to gather ourselves for battle.

2403
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:56.338
"When we got there, we missed it, it was already over

2404
01:38:56.338 --> 01:38:58.121
"and they were cleaning it up, it was very disappointing.

2405
01:38:58.121 --> 01:39:03.121
"Somebody defaced the Chantry."

2406
01:39:03.683 --> 01:39:04.689
LAURA: What?

2407
01:39:04.689 --> 01:39:08.288
MATT: "All of the stained glass, broken, everywhere.

2408
01:39:08.288 --> 01:39:10.401
"It was beautiful."

2409
01:39:10.401 --> 01:39:13.441
LAURA: I mean, yes, I heard it was so beautiful,

2410
01:39:13.441 --> 01:39:16.274
we were going to go look at it,
we were going to go check it out.

2411
01:39:16.274 --> 01:39:18.447
TRAVIS: Yeah, we heard there were all sorts of creatures.

2412
01:39:18.447 --> 01:39:21.726
MATT: "Yeah, there was a Dynasty attack as well, same time.

2413
01:39:21.726 --> 01:39:24.215
"Man, stuff's been crazy since we got here.

2414
01:39:24.215 --> 01:39:26.003
"It's been wild.

2415
01:39:26.003 --> 01:39:28.306
"I mean--"
TRAVIS: No other Dynasty attacks.

2416
01:39:28.306 --> 01:39:31.393
MATT: "Not specifically here,
but now we know they can burrow,

2417
01:39:31.393 --> 01:39:32.831
"I mean, they can come any time."

2418
01:39:32.831 --> 01:39:34.159
LAURA: That's true.

2419
01:39:34.159 --> 01:39:35.901
MATT: "Kind of brings you to a point of appreciating

2420
01:39:35.901 --> 01:39:40.303
"and you know, carpe diem, as the old Zemnians used to say."

2421
01:39:40.303 --> 01:39:43.430
(laughter)
SAM: That tracks.

2422
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:45.571
MARISHA: Wait, what?
MATT: "I don't read up, look.

2423
01:39:45.571 --> 01:39:48.533
"I was a street kid, I was not--" (laughing)

2424
01:39:48.533 --> 01:39:49.868
TALIESIN: God of carpets?

2425
01:39:49.868 --> 01:39:52.460
MATT: "Yes, yes, probably.

2426
01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:53.649
"I like you.

2427
01:39:53.649 --> 01:39:55.186
"What's your name?"

2428
01:39:55.186 --> 01:39:56.741
TALIESIN: Oh, Caduceus, hey.
MATT: "Caduceus."

2429
01:39:56.741 --> 01:39:58.097
TALIESIN: We met last night?

2430
01:39:58.097 --> 01:39:59.561
Last night, just very briefly.

2431
01:39:59.561 --> 01:40:00.733
You did very well.

2432
01:40:00.733 --> 01:40:01.689
MATT: "Right, right."
LAURA: Two nights ago.

2433
01:40:01.689 --> 01:40:03.358
TALIESIN: Two nights ago, wow, time flies.

2434
01:40:03.358 --> 01:40:04.608
MATT: "It's all crazy.

2435
01:40:06.287 --> 01:40:07.938
"Anyway, is this the place?"

2436
01:40:07.938 --> 01:40:08.885
MARISHA: Yeah.

2437
01:40:08.885 --> 01:40:11.552
(laughter)

2438
01:40:12.476 --> 01:40:14.363
TALIESIN: 2020.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2439
01:40:14.363 --> 01:40:16.697
MATT: You do get a group rate.

2440
01:40:16.697 --> 01:40:18.426
LAURA: Oh, hey!

2441
01:40:18.426 --> 01:40:20.326
MATT: So that's, I'd say 12 gold a person

2442
01:40:20.326 --> 01:40:22.694
for the same four-hour spa experience.

2443
01:40:22.694 --> 01:40:23.828
LAURA: Whoa, four hours.

2444
01:40:23.828 --> 01:40:24.926
MARISHA: Are we going to do four hours?

2445
01:40:24.926 --> 01:40:26.405
Maybe we should only do two.

2446
01:40:26.405 --> 01:40:28.582
SAM: Yeah, so we can fucking get out of here.

2447
01:40:28.582 --> 01:40:32.528
LAURA: This is like when Dorothy gets remade, you know?

2448
01:40:32.528 --> 01:40:34.179
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

2449
01:40:34.179 --> 01:40:36.425
LAURA: When like, all of a sudden has curls and stuff.

2450
01:40:36.425 --> 01:40:37.351
(Matt chuckling)

2451
01:40:37.351 --> 01:40:40.765
MARISHA and LAURA: Can you dye my eyes to match my gown?

2452
01:40:40.765 --> 01:40:41.929
TRAVIS: (muttering) What is this?

2453
01:40:41.929 --> 01:40:43.571
MARISHA: Wizard of fucking Oz.

2454
01:40:43.571 --> 01:40:44.404
LAURA: What?

2455
01:40:44.404 --> 01:40:46.459
TRAVIS: I don't think that happened in the movie.

2456
01:40:46.459 --> 01:40:47.649
MATT: Don't google that film.

2457
01:40:47.649 --> 01:40:50.317
SAM: Dorothy goes to the spa in Wizard of Oz?

2458
01:40:50.317 --> 01:40:53.801
Meanwhile, I threw two throwing stars at Beauregard.

2459
01:40:53.801 --> 01:40:55.978
LAURA: Oh, fuck.
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

2460
01:40:55.978 --> 01:40:59.067
TRAVIS: They just been sticking out of her cheeks.

2461
01:40:59.067 --> 01:41:00.325
Trying to pull them.

2462
01:41:00.325 --> 01:41:01.591
MARISHA: Ah! Ah!

2463
01:41:01.591 --> 01:41:04.293
TALIESIN: Looks like someone named Bob
really doesn't like you.

2464
01:41:04.293 --> 01:41:06.233
MARISHA: Jester, can you get them?

2465
01:41:06.233 --> 01:41:07.072
Can you get them out?

2466
01:41:07.072 --> 01:41:09.095
LAURA: Oh, but I got to pull it out in order to heal.

2467
01:41:09.095 --> 01:41:10.515
One, two, three.

2468
01:41:10.515 --> 01:41:12.502
(Marisha gasping)
(Laura groaning)

2469
01:41:12.502 --> 01:41:14.286
SAM: I thought you would catch them, you have,

2470
01:41:14.286 --> 01:41:15.802
like, you catch missiles.

2471
01:41:15.802 --> 01:41:16.950
TRAVIS: Yeah, she did, with her face.

2472
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:20.317
MARISHA: I didn't say "deflect missiles,"
so it didn't happen.

2473
01:41:20.317 --> 01:41:22.945
SAM: I thought you'd catch them, I'm sorry.

2474
01:41:22.945 --> 01:41:24.565
MARISHA: Why do they say "bob" on them?

2475
01:41:24.565 --> 01:41:26.969
SAM: Hold it upside down.

2476
01:41:26.969 --> 01:41:30.023
MARISHA: Oh, oh, that's good.

2477
01:41:30.023 --> 01:41:31.622
Yeah, that's good.

2478
01:41:31.622 --> 01:41:32.659
TRAVIS: You're bleeding out of your face.

2479
01:41:32.659 --> 01:41:34.626
MARISHA: The spa will fix it.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2480
01:41:34.626 --> 01:41:36.409
MATT: Hilariously, though they say "bob"

2481
01:41:36.409 --> 01:41:38.250
when you look at it that way,

2482
01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:40.268
because when you turn it right up, the Ps are backwards.

2483
01:41:40.268 --> 01:41:42.445
TALIESIN: Thank you, thank you, I was really hoping,

2484
01:41:42.445 --> 01:41:44.017
that's all I wanted.

2485
01:41:44.017 --> 01:41:45.172
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2486
01:41:45.172 --> 01:41:46.549
That's right.

2487
01:41:46.549 --> 01:41:49.406
TALIESIN: That's all I wanted.

2488
01:41:49.406 --> 01:41:50.529
MARISHA: Like a bad tattoo.

2489
01:41:50.529 --> 01:41:52.462
SAM: You have to hold them up in a mirror.

2490
01:41:52.462 --> 01:41:55.846
(laughter)

2491
01:41:59.853 --> 01:42:02.741
MATT: You find yourselves-- are you paying

2492
01:42:02.741 --> 01:42:04.736
for the two hours or four hours?

2493
01:42:04.736 --> 01:42:06.531
LAURA: Four hours!
TALIESIN: Four hours!

2494
01:42:06.531 --> 01:42:07.419
LAURA: 12 gold!

2495
01:42:07.419 --> 01:42:09.775
MATT: True, true D&amp;D choices to make.

2496
01:42:09.775 --> 01:42:11.064
(Liam groans)

2497
01:42:11.064 --> 01:42:12.649
(Matt chuckling)
SAM: I'm not going in.

2498
01:42:12.649 --> 01:42:14.032
LAURA: What?
MARISHA: What, why?

2499
01:42:14.032 --> 01:42:15.708
SAM: There's water in there, fuckers!

2500
01:42:15.708 --> 01:42:17.104
LAURA: You don't have to, there's mud baths.

2501
01:42:17.104 --> 01:42:18.732
SAM: I'll do that.
LAURA: Okay.

2502
01:42:18.732 --> 01:42:21.703
MATT: Okay, that's a viable option.

2503
01:42:21.703 --> 01:42:23.020
MARISHA: Okay.

2504
01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:25.011
MATT: All right, so that's 12 gold each

2505
01:42:25.011 --> 01:42:26.319
for those who take it,

2506
01:42:26.319 --> 01:42:30.240
and you spend four hours conversing with, loudly,

2507
01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:35.240
the boisterous, charismatic, and,

2508
01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.367
in spite of his forceful personality,

2509
01:42:38.367 --> 01:42:41.044
just likable guy, Darrow.

2510
01:42:41.044 --> 01:42:43.547
LAURA: I really do like him a lot.

2511
01:42:43.547 --> 01:42:46.933
MATT: He's fun fella.
TALIESIN: Nice guy all around.

2512
01:42:46.933 --> 01:42:49.006
SAM: During the thing, I'm going to just try to ask him

2513
01:42:49.006 --> 01:42:50.936
one more time who his client is,

2514
01:42:50.936 --> 01:42:55.119
maybe in a moment of bliss when he's just relaxing.

2515
01:42:55.119 --> 01:42:56.248
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2516
01:42:56.248 --> 01:42:58.541
SAM: I'm good at this, guys.

2517
01:42:58.541 --> 01:42:59.698
Five.

2518
01:42:59.698 --> 01:43:02.798
MATT: He's like, "(sighs).

2519
01:43:04.041 --> 01:43:05.374
"Nice try."

2520
01:43:05.374 --> 01:43:08.602
(laughter)

2521
01:43:08.602 --> 01:43:11.229
(Laura humming)

2522
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:14.017
SAM: Big arms you got there.

2523
01:43:14.017 --> 01:43:15.657
MATT: "Oh, I know."

2524
01:43:15.657 --> 01:43:17.090
(Darrow chuckles)

2525
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:18.273
SAM: All right.

2526
01:43:18.273 --> 01:43:19.991
I'm going to go back to my mud pit.

2527
01:43:19.991 --> 01:43:22.325
(Matt laughs)

2528
01:43:22.325 --> 01:43:25.219
MARISHA: On the way out, is this the type of spa

2529
01:43:25.219 --> 01:43:28.108
that has the little complimentary tooth brushes?

2530
01:43:28.108 --> 01:43:30.382
MATT: No.

2531
01:43:30.382 --> 01:43:31.285
MARISHA: No.

2532
01:43:31.285 --> 01:43:33.425
TALIESIN: Now we're going to be
thinking about it, aren't we?

2533
01:43:33.425 --> 01:43:36.190
MARISHA: I'm really self-conscious now.

2534
01:43:36.190 --> 01:43:38.272
LAURA: They probably have them for sale, though.

2535
01:43:38.272 --> 01:43:39.457
They're not complimentary.

2536
01:43:39.457 --> 01:43:40.367
MARISHA: Do they have them for sale?

2537
01:43:40.367 --> 01:43:41.764
TRAVIS: They have mouthwash, though.

2538
01:43:41.764 --> 01:43:43.701
MATT: Sure.

2539
01:43:43.701 --> 01:43:45.482
TRAVIS: They got mouthwash.

2540
01:43:45.482 --> 01:43:47.028
SAM: Guys, guys!
LAURA: What?

2541
01:43:47.028 --> 01:43:51.123
SAM: I was just contacted
telepathically by the Bright Queen.

2542
01:43:51.123 --> 01:43:54.344
She wants us to go to Xhorhas right away!

2543
01:43:54.344 --> 01:43:56.684
MARISHA: I'm handing out toothbrushes to everybody.

2544
01:43:56.684 --> 01:43:57.708
LAURA: You're not saying that out loud, right?

2545
01:43:57.708 --> 01:43:59.342
SAM: No, no no, just to you guys.

2546
01:43:59.342 --> 01:44:00.592
Darrow is gone.

2547
01:44:02.542 --> 01:44:04.199
MATT: (as Darrow) "Wait, what's going on?"

2548
01:44:04.199 --> 01:44:06.532
SAM: Nothing. Fuck off.

2549
01:44:06.532 --> 01:44:07.600
TRAVIS: (laughing) Fuck off!

2550
01:44:08.883 --> 01:44:10.161
MATT: "Okay."

2551
01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:11.977
LAURA: No, Darrow.

2552
01:44:12.934 --> 01:44:14.545
TRAVIS: By the way, Darrow, before you leave,

2553
01:44:14.545 --> 01:44:15.649
are you staying in Rexxentrum,

2554
01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.389
or do your adventures take you elsewhere,

2555
01:44:17.389 --> 01:44:19.039
do you plan to leave?

2556
01:44:19.039 --> 01:44:20.183
MATT: "I have to check in.

2557
01:44:20.183 --> 01:44:22.270
"We've only been here for about a month, I think.

2558
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:25.471
"We've, all along he Menagerie Coast.

2559
01:44:25.471 --> 01:44:27.361
"We only recently come here, and I think

2560
01:44:27.361 --> 01:44:28.561
"we're probably heading back."

2561
01:44:28.561 --> 01:44:29.703
TRAVIS: Nice.

2562
01:44:29.703 --> 01:44:32.033
Well, safe travels, if we don't see you again.

2563
01:44:32.033 --> 01:44:33.017
It's been a pleasure.

2564
01:44:33.017 --> 01:44:33.850
MATT: "You as well.

2565
01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:35.730
"Keep it up."
LAURA: I'll be in touch with you.

2566
01:44:35.730 --> 01:44:37.164
We can be friends.

2567
01:44:37.164 --> 01:44:38.238
MATT: "Sure, yeah.

2568
01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:39.834
"Feel free to write a letter. We move around a lot,

2569
01:44:39.834 --> 01:44:41.135
"so it might take a while."

2570
01:44:41.135 --> 01:44:42.586
LAURA: Don't worry, I'll find you.

2571
01:44:42.586 --> 01:44:44.520
MATT: "That sounds ominous."

2572
01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.695
(Travis and Taliesin laugh)

2573
01:44:46.695 --> 01:44:48.911
MATT: "Stay safe, friends."

2574
01:44:48.911 --> 01:44:51.922
And he gets his equipment and weapons, and makes his exit.

2575
01:44:51.922 --> 01:44:53.230
LAURA: That was so nice.
LIAM: Do you want him turned into

2576
01:44:53.230 --> 01:44:54.625
a chimpanzee or something?

2577
01:44:54.625 --> 01:44:56.438
TRAVIS: No, I don't. He taught me a good lesson.

2578
01:44:56.438 --> 01:44:59.693
I mean, if I can do that to someone else,

2579
01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:01.565
it'll have served its purpose.

2580
01:45:01.565 --> 01:45:03.133
ASHLEY: What, kick their ass, or?

2581
01:45:03.133 --> 01:45:05.713
TRAVIS: No, no, no, he's very nice.

2582
01:45:05.713 --> 01:45:08.026
LAURA: Did we get a feel for him, being around him,

2583
01:45:08.026 --> 01:45:09.710
if he actually was genuinely nice,

2584
01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:10.685
or if he was trying to like--

2585
01:45:10.685 --> 01:45:12.585
MATT: Make an insight check.

2586
01:45:15.034 --> 01:45:17.952
TALIESIN: I like to think I have a passive insight check.

2587
01:45:17.952 --> 01:45:19.862
(Laura groans)

2588
01:45:19.862 --> 01:45:20.763
TALIESIN: 22.

2589
01:45:20.763 --> 01:45:21.761
MATT: Okay.

2590
01:45:21.761 --> 01:45:23.132
LAURA: (groans)
MATT: What'd you get?

2591
01:45:23.132 --> 01:45:25.140
LAURA: I got eight.

2592
01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:26.658
MATT: Aha.

2593
01:45:26.658 --> 01:45:30.792
SAM: Guys, Skillshare offers a bevy of classes

2594
01:45:30.792 --> 01:45:33.950
you don't have to be a baby Yoda to enjoy.

2595
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:35.996
TRAVIS: It's not called Baby <i>Yoda</i>.

2596
01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.402
SAM: Sorry.

2597
01:45:37.402 --> 01:45:39.211
<i>Baby</i> Yoda.

2598
01:45:39.211 --> 01:45:40.423
Yoda Junior?

2599
01:45:40.423 --> 01:45:41.846
LIAM: Planet Earth has voted.

2600
01:45:41.846 --> 01:45:43.074
MARISHA: Yeah, planet Earth says--

2601
01:45:43.074 --> 01:45:46.738
SAM: The child, the asset, whatever you want to call it.

2602
01:45:46.738 --> 01:45:48.441
You can find out what it's called

2603
01:45:48.441 --> 01:45:50.515
when you take a class at Skillshare.

2604
01:45:50.515 --> 01:45:51.687
LAURA: I like him.

2605
01:45:51.687 --> 01:45:52.908
(Matt and Laura laughing)

2606
01:45:52.908 --> 01:45:54.632
TALIESIN: Seems like an all right guy.

2607
01:45:54.632 --> 01:45:55.465
TRAVIS: Cool.

2608
01:45:55.465 --> 01:45:57.720
ASHLEY: In those four hours, I'm going to read.

2609
01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.794
MATT: Okay.

2610
01:45:58.794 --> 01:46:00.370
TALIESIN: Spa read.
ASHLEY: So I have four hours left.

2611
01:46:00.370 --> 01:46:01.661
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: There you go.

2612
01:46:01.661 --> 01:46:03.691
Spa read, easy enough to do.

2613
01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:06.627
TRAVIS: Nott, you said you got a very important message.

2614
01:46:06.627 --> 01:46:10.874
SAM: Yes I did, that we should move along.

2615
01:46:10.874 --> 01:46:11.707
TALIESIN: Insight check.

2616
01:46:11.707 --> 01:46:13.456
SAM: Away from this-- I'm lying.

2617
01:46:13.456 --> 01:46:14.813
(laughter)

2618
01:46:14.813 --> 01:46:17.242
TALIESIN: That's good to know because I rolled a one.

2619
01:46:17.242 --> 01:46:18.723
(laughter)

2620
01:46:18.723 --> 01:46:20.524
SAM: We should leave.
LAURA: We should go.

2621
01:46:20.524 --> 01:46:24.106
TRAVIS: Are we going to travel,
or are we going to foop?

2622
01:46:24.106 --> 01:46:25.247
LAURA: We can foop.

2623
01:46:25.247 --> 01:46:26.455
SAM: We have to foomf.

2624
01:46:26.455 --> 01:46:28.750
TRAVIS: I said "foop," you said "foomf."

2625
01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:30.208
SAM: Whatever.

2626
01:46:30.208 --> 01:46:32.475
LIAM: The correct term is foomp.

2627
01:46:32.475 --> 01:46:34.537
Do we want to go right from here, or--

2628
01:46:34.537 --> 01:46:35.687
SAM: I think so.
LIAM: Yeah.

2629
01:46:35.687 --> 01:46:37.419
TALIESIN: Let's go--
TRAVIS: From the spa.

2630
01:46:37.419 --> 01:46:39.125
SAM: Yeah, we're alone here.

2631
01:46:39.125 --> 01:46:39.958
MARISHA: In our robes.

2632
01:46:39.958 --> 01:46:41.353
TALIESIN: We should go get our things, and--

2633
01:46:41.353 --> 01:46:43.096
LAURA: Yeah, let's put our clothes on.

2634
01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:44.482
SAM: All right.

2635
01:46:44.482 --> 01:46:45.319
LIAM: Hey.

2636
01:46:45.319 --> 01:46:48.364
TALIESIN: We can keep our robes,
because it's that kind of spa.

2637
01:46:48.364 --> 01:46:50.053
LAURA: Eyyy.

2638
01:46:50.053 --> 01:46:51.983
TALIESIN: Because it's that kind of spa.

2639
01:46:51.983 --> 01:46:52.816
MATT: No.

2640
01:46:52.816 --> 01:46:53.937
(Ashley laughing)

2641
01:46:53.937 --> 01:46:55.134
LAURA: 12 gold, man.

2642
01:46:55.134 --> 01:46:56.758
Yeah, that's true, they didn't--

2643
01:46:56.758 --> 01:46:59.473
MARISHA: How much were the toothbrushes?

2644
01:46:59.473 --> 01:47:01.159
LAURA: Oh, did you get toothbrushes for everyone?

2645
01:47:01.159 --> 01:47:02.547
MARISHA: I did.

2646
01:47:02.547 --> 01:47:04.325
MATT: Five silver for the batch.

2647
01:47:04.325 --> 01:47:06.075
MARISHA: Five silver.

2648
01:47:06.075 --> 01:47:07.857
MATT: Which is pricey.

2649
01:47:07.857 --> 01:47:09.150
LAURA: That's a lot for a toothbrush.

2650
01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:12.362
MATT: But that happens when
you buy them out of the spa.

2651
01:47:12.362 --> 01:47:13.195
TALIESIN: Wow.

2652
01:47:13.195 --> 01:47:15.412
MATT: (laughs)

2653
01:47:15.412 --> 01:47:16.937
MATT: That exit gift shop, man.

2654
01:47:16.937 --> 01:47:17.795
That's where they get ya.

2655
01:47:17.795 --> 01:47:18.739
LIAM: Where else are you going to go?

2656
01:47:18.739 --> 01:47:19.604
LAURA: You're all relaxed.

2657
01:47:19.604 --> 01:47:21.143
TRAVIS: Those damn candles.

2658
01:47:21.143 --> 01:47:22.661
$65?!

2659
01:47:22.661 --> 01:47:25.164
(laughter)

2660
01:47:25.164 --> 01:47:26.904
Does smell nice, though.

2661
01:47:26.904 --> 01:47:28.371
And it's wrapped in bark.

2662
01:47:28.371 --> 01:47:30.863
(laughter)

2663
01:47:32.463 --> 01:47:34.192
TALIESIN: This is D&amp;D, everything's wrapped in bark.

2664
01:47:34.192 --> 01:47:36.123
TRAVIS: I've seen those fucking things.

2665
01:47:36.123 --> 01:47:38.194
TALIESIN: I'd be more impressed
if it were wrapped in plastic.

2666
01:47:38.194 --> 01:47:39.853
TRAVIS: What else does this do?

2667
01:47:39.853 --> 01:47:41.666
(laughter)

2668
01:47:41.666 --> 01:47:43.301
Does it sparkle or something?

2669
01:47:43.301 --> 01:47:46.157
MATT: This is the quintessential experience of a person

2670
01:47:46.157 --> 01:47:48.568
that has been to a spa once in their adult life

2671
01:47:48.568 --> 01:47:50.738
and is like: What is this place?!

2672
01:47:50.738 --> 01:47:52.798
(laughter)

2673
01:47:52.798 --> 01:47:54.676
I don't belong here.

2674
01:47:54.676 --> 01:47:56.041
LIAM: Can I get some ice cheese, please?

2675
01:47:56.041 --> 01:47:58.077
Do you want it in a bowl or a cone of bark?

2676
01:47:58.077 --> 01:48:01.266
(laughter)

2677
01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:02.946
MATT: All righty.

2678
01:48:02.946 --> 01:48:03.779
So.

2679
01:48:03.779 --> 01:48:06.928
Are you teleporting from the spa?

2680
01:48:06.928 --> 01:48:09.382
LIAM: Did anyone leave anything behind?

2681
01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:10.512
LAURA: No, we got all our stuff.

2682
01:48:10.512 --> 01:48:11.721
TALIESIN: Do we have all of our stuff?

2683
01:48:11.721 --> 01:48:12.554
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

2684
01:48:12.554 --> 01:48:13.625
TALIESIN: Sure.

2685
01:48:13.625 --> 01:48:14.846
MATT: I'll allow it.

2686
01:48:14.846 --> 01:48:15.689
LAURA: Yay.

2687
01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:17.506
MARISHA: We get all our stuff.

2688
01:48:17.506 --> 01:48:18.570
MATT: Okay.

2689
01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:23.570
LIAM: I begin to draw a circle
here on the floor of the spa.

2690
01:48:24.228 --> 01:48:25.819
Some amount of time later.

2691
01:48:25.819 --> 01:48:26.845
TALIESIN: Bath salts.

2692
01:48:26.845 --> 01:48:28.199
LAURA: No, okay, can I just point out--

2693
01:48:28.199 --> 01:48:29.331
TRAVIS: Jesus.

2694
01:48:29.331 --> 01:48:32.349
LAURA: We're in the spa, so
if we took the robes with us,

2695
01:48:32.349 --> 01:48:34.847
they wouldn't know. They would just think

2696
01:48:34.847 --> 01:48:35.760
that we disappeared.

2697
01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.534
MARISHA: I didn't change.
I said I grabbed my stuff,

2698
01:48:37.534 --> 01:48:39.091
I did not specify that I changed.

2699
01:48:39.091 --> 01:48:40.906
I am bamfing in this robe.

2700
01:48:40.906 --> 01:48:42.164
MATT: All right.
SAM: We're going to steal the robes.

2701
01:48:42.164 --> 01:48:44.131
MATT: You guys are about nine minutes into

2702
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:45.368
the ritual preparation, which I believe

2703
01:48:45.368 --> 01:48:46.804
is 10 minutes for it, right?
LIAM: Yeah.

2704
01:48:46.804 --> 01:48:48.333
MATT: And you hear (knocking).

2705
01:48:48.333 --> 01:48:49.595
SAM: One second!

2706
01:48:49.595 --> 01:48:50.768
Not decent.

2707
01:48:50.768 --> 01:48:52.960
MARISHA: Naked.
LAURA: Very, very naked.

2708
01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:55.320
MATT: "Your time is about up."

2709
01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.232
LAURA: Yeah, we got, like, a minute left or something?

2710
01:48:57.232 --> 01:48:58.697
MATT: "Would you like some towel service?"

2711
01:48:58.697 --> 01:48:59.916
LAURA: No, we're okay right now,

2712
01:48:59.916 --> 01:49:03.176
we're still-- all of us, we're naked together.

2713
01:49:03.176 --> 01:49:04.545
MATT: "All right."

2714
01:49:04.545 --> 01:49:08.548
MARISHA: Just throw the towels through
the door, don't look though.

2715
01:49:08.548 --> 01:49:09.381
MATT: "Okay."

2716
01:49:09.381 --> 01:49:10.812
SAM: Make some steam, make some steam.

2717
01:49:10.812 --> 01:49:13.340
(laughter)

2718
01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.346
LAURA: (stammering)

2719
01:49:17.346 --> 01:49:20.097
MATT: "It's all right,
there you are, all right.

2720
01:49:20.097 --> 01:49:21.608
"Would you like some tea--"
(door slam)

2721
01:49:21.608 --> 01:49:23.307
(laughter)

2722
01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:24.140
MARISHA: How are they? Are they nice towels?

2723
01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:25.396
LAURA: They're pretty fluffy.
SAM: Take them, take them.

2724
01:49:25.396 --> 01:49:26.486
MARISHA: Yeah, they're coming with us.

2725
01:49:26.486 --> 01:49:29.018
We need them for the Xhorhaus.

2726
01:49:29.018 --> 01:49:31.506
MATT: As you finish the circle.

2727
01:49:31.506 --> 01:49:34.839
The arcane energy erupts from the circle

2728
01:49:34.839 --> 01:49:39.493
as all of you, in your various
freshly laundered spa robes

2729
01:49:39.493 --> 01:49:43.364
and cluster of stolen towels, rush into

2730
01:49:43.364 --> 01:49:44.958
the central teleportation circle.

2731
01:49:44.958 --> 01:49:47.047
(whooshing)

2732
01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:48.988
And the towel slipper things?

2733
01:49:48.988 --> 01:49:50.221
MATT: Yep, those too.

2734
01:49:50.221 --> 01:49:51.848
Yep, nice terry cloth.

2735
01:49:51.848 --> 01:49:53.795
LIAM: One giant aasimar hand goes (whooshing).

2736
01:49:53.795 --> 01:49:55.917
(laughter)

2737
01:49:55.917 --> 01:49:59.256
MATT: As you all emerged on the other side,

2738
01:49:59.256 --> 01:50:01.477
beneath the Lucid Bastion.
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2739
01:50:01.477 --> 01:50:04.775
MATT: The basement beneath the
central cathedral of Rosohna.

2740
01:50:04.775 --> 01:50:05.783
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

2741
01:50:05.783 --> 01:50:07.108
LAURA: We should probably change.

2742
01:50:07.108 --> 01:50:09.082
MARISHA: No, this feels good,
this feels like success.

2743
01:50:09.082 --> 01:50:10.971
MATT: The guards turn immediately,

2744
01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:15.480
in their, you know, Kryn
royal guard attire and armor,

2745
01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.603
spinning, spears at the ready, looking upon you,

2746
01:50:18.603 --> 01:50:22.040
recognizing, and then heads turn curiously.

2747
01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:24.137
(Travis laughs)
ASHLEY: I'm holding slippers.

2748
01:50:24.137 --> 01:50:25.322
(Marisha laughs)

2749
01:50:25.322 --> 01:50:27.859
LIAM: Bathrobe and book holsters.

2750
01:50:27.859 --> 01:50:29.225
SAM: Covered in mud.
MATT: Yeah.

2751
01:50:29.225 --> 01:50:31.026
(laughter)

2752
01:50:31.026 --> 01:50:32.581
TRAVIS: Nott, you're supposed to wash it off.

2753
01:50:32.581 --> 01:50:34.205
SAM: I don't like the water part.

2754
01:50:34.205 --> 01:50:35.786
(laughter)

2755
01:50:35.786 --> 01:50:38.404
MATT: As you're dragging
your armor over a shoulder.

2756
01:50:38.404 --> 01:50:42.799
LIAM: I love the guards just
witnessing this bickering spa group

2757
01:50:42.799 --> 01:50:44.280
as they show up.

2758
01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:47.471
MATT: They rotate back into their position,

2759
01:50:47.471 --> 01:50:51.985
but keep a curious eye on
all of you as you pass by.

2760
01:50:51.985 --> 01:50:55.894
So, yep, you are leaving
a slight wet foot trail

2761
01:50:55.894 --> 01:50:58.835
through and up the stairs
into the central region

2762
01:50:58.835 --> 01:51:01.669
of the Lucid Bastion.

2763
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:04.350
Do you wish to head to the Xhorhaus,

2764
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:05.842
or do you wish to go
straight to the Bright Queen?

2765
01:51:05.842 --> 01:51:07.597
SAM: What time is it here in--
LAURA: Let's go to the Xhorhaus.

2766
01:51:07.597 --> 01:51:08.980
MARISHA: Yeah, we should check in.

2767
01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:09.813
TALIESIN: We should go change.

2768
01:51:09.813 --> 01:51:10.646
MATT: Okay.

2769
01:51:10.646 --> 01:51:11.761
MARISHA: We'll get into our formals.

2770
01:51:11.761 --> 01:51:13.216
TRAVIS: My feet never fit in these slippers,

2771
01:51:13.216 --> 01:51:14.582
so I'm putting my clothes back on

2772
01:51:14.582 --> 01:51:17.369
before we walk through the city.

2773
01:51:17.369 --> 01:51:18.970
I'm always cramming my feet into the slippers,

2774
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:20.536
they end right before my heel.

2775
01:51:20.536 --> 01:51:22.091
TALIESIN: Yeah, I feel like even my robe

2776
01:51:22.091 --> 01:51:23.249
would only come up to here.

2777
01:51:23.249 --> 01:51:26.496
TRAVIS: Yeah, yours is just below the dangle, like--

2778
01:51:26.496 --> 01:51:28.354
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Mushroom tip.

2779
01:51:28.354 --> 01:51:31.348
(laughter)

2780
01:51:31.348 --> 01:51:33.866
MATT: You're Peter Panning it
pretty hard right now.

2781
01:51:33.866 --> 01:51:36.440
(laughter)

2782
01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.830
TRAVIS: Mushroom tip is so appropriate!

2783
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:40.244
MARISHA: It is.

2784
01:51:40.244 --> 01:51:41.915
LIAM: It's the tiniest little kimono.

2785
01:51:41.915 --> 01:51:42.917
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

2786
01:51:42.917 --> 01:51:44.853
(laughter)

2787
01:51:44.853 --> 01:51:47.195
ASHLEY: In a sexy little bathrobe.

2788
01:51:49.095 --> 01:51:52.463
MATT: Fjord gets dressed while the rest of you,

2789
01:51:52.463 --> 01:51:56.015
not following his lead, make your way through

2790
01:51:56.015 --> 01:51:59.846
the massive stone and marble archways

2791
01:51:59.846 --> 01:52:03.212
of the echoing interior of the Lucid Bastion.

2792
01:52:03.212 --> 01:52:04.045
TRAVIS: All you idiots.

2793
01:52:04.045 --> 01:52:07.596
MATT: Going past various guards and figures,

2794
01:52:07.596 --> 01:52:12.357
stately members of various dens of the Kryn Dynasty,

2795
01:52:12.357 --> 01:52:16.389
all walking by and curiously turning their head

2796
01:52:16.389 --> 01:52:17.916
as they watch you pass.

2797
01:52:17.916 --> 01:52:21.370
LIAM: I cast Seeming on Fjord
so he looks like he's in a robe.

2798
01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:26.270
(laughter)

2799
01:52:29.026 --> 01:52:33.752
TALIESIN: That's the best [inaudible].
Very well done! Capital, capital!

2800
01:52:33.752 --> 01:52:35.491
LIAM: But everybody else looks dressed in their regular--

2801
01:52:35.491 --> 01:52:40.358
(laughter)

2802
01:52:41.269 --> 01:52:46.269
MATT: Just as you step outside of the Bastion, (whooshes).

2803
01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:49.236
But the thing is, he doesn't notice at first.

2804
01:52:49.236 --> 01:52:50.892
MARISHA: Yeah.

2805
01:52:50.892 --> 01:52:52.458
TRAVIS: Good day.

2806
01:52:52.458 --> 01:52:54.367
How are you, yes, well?

2807
01:52:55.952 --> 01:52:57.910
MATT: Partway through the stares and glares

2808
01:52:57.910 --> 01:53:01.303
that now seem to be averting your friends

2809
01:53:01.303 --> 01:53:03.472
and more focusing on you, you look down upon yourself

2810
01:53:03.472 --> 01:53:07.322
and notice the bright terrycloth presentation

2811
01:53:07.322 --> 01:53:08.795
you're currently putting before.

2812
01:53:08.795 --> 01:53:12.653
TRAVIS: Which one of you fuckers did this?

2813
01:53:12.653 --> 01:53:14.888
SAM: It wasn't me, I don't know that kind of magic.

2814
01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:16.592
ASHLEY: It definitely wasn't me either.

2815
01:53:16.592 --> 01:53:19.647
LIAM: Caleb wouldn't do that either, he's a good person.

2816
01:53:19.647 --> 01:53:22.314
ASHLEY: Are you sure that you changed?

2817
01:53:23.427 --> 01:53:25.076
TRAVIS: Yes, it's not real.

2818
01:53:25.076 --> 01:53:26.670
(laughter)

2819
01:53:26.670 --> 01:53:28.253
I can't get it off.

2820
01:53:29.097 --> 01:53:31.872
But it's not real.

2821
01:53:31.872 --> 01:53:36.554
(laughter)

2822
01:53:36.554 --> 01:53:40.261
LIAM: Caleb is watching, in his fine Kryn garb,

2823
01:53:40.261 --> 01:53:43.675
and enjoying his naughty bits just free in the wind.

2824
01:53:43.675 --> 01:53:46.048
(laughter)

2825
01:53:46.048 --> 01:53:47.306
MATT: As you all slowly walk

2826
01:53:47.306 --> 01:53:51.698
towards the prominent obelisk

2827
01:53:51.698 --> 01:53:54.810
that is the massive lit tree that now still looms

2828
01:53:54.810 --> 01:53:56.184
over the surrounding neighborhood

2829
01:53:56.184 --> 01:53:58.660
here in the Gallimaufry district,

2830
01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:01.451
towards the Xhorhaus,

2831
01:54:01.451 --> 01:54:04.733
returned in proper attire.

2832
01:54:04.733 --> 01:54:05.969
And we'll take a break there.

2833
01:54:05.969 --> 01:54:06.948
(laughter and groaning)

2834
01:54:06.948 --> 01:54:09.783
Pick up from there here in a short time.

2835
01:54:09.783 --> 01:54:11.673
(laughter)

2836
01:54:11.673 --> 01:54:14.240
I missed you guys.

2837
01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:17.088
(laughter)

2838
01:54:17.088 --> 01:54:18.171
SAM: Wow.

2839
01:54:18.171 --> 01:54:19.574
ASHLEY: Well done, sir.
MARISHA: We never returned

2840
01:54:19.574 --> 01:54:21.628
to our conversation about the Bright Queen

2841
01:54:21.628 --> 01:54:23.168
and what we're going to tell her.

2842
01:54:23.168 --> 01:54:25.228
MATT: You can continue that in your home.

2843
01:54:25.228 --> 01:54:26.793
All right, so, before we go to break,

2844
01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:30.368
we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway, first of 2020.

2845
01:54:30.368 --> 01:54:34.329
Oh, the classic purpleheart tabletop dice tray.

2846
01:54:34.329 --> 01:54:35.591
The Scanlan special.

2847
01:54:35.591 --> 01:54:37.413
It goes to one lucky winner in our chat.

2848
01:54:37.413 --> 01:54:40.696
Tonight's keyword is recovery.

2849
01:54:40.696 --> 01:54:41.971
Recovery.

2850
01:54:41.971 --> 01:54:43.890
Once and only once in the chatroom,

2851
01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:45.143
more than once, you'll be disqualified.

2852
01:54:45.143 --> 01:54:47.959
Once again, only US and Canada, excluding Quebec,

2853
01:54:47.959 --> 01:54:49.201
because of stupid giveaway laws,

2854
01:54:49.201 --> 01:54:51.258
and we'll be back here from the break

2855
01:54:51.258 --> 01:54:52.479
with one lucky winner.

2856
01:54:52.479 --> 01:54:56.303
We'll see you guys here in a few minutes.

2857
01:54:56.303 --> 01:54:57.782

MARISHA: Welcome to our end of the year
Critmas fireside chat.

2876
01:55:49.665 --> 01:55:54.387
We're going to answer some questions, do some reflecting.

2877
01:55:54.387 --> 01:55:55.521
TRAVIS: We don't even have a fire, though.

2878
01:55:55.521 --> 01:55:57.283
MARISHA: Enjoy--
LIAM: It's right there.

2879
01:55:57.283 --> 01:55:59.705
MATT: The fire was the friends we made along the way.

2880
01:55:59.705 --> 01:56:01.009
LIAM: The warmth of the community.

2881
01:56:01.009 --> 01:56:03.210
ASHLEY: Everybody's asking where Sam is.

2882
01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:04.043
LAURA: Yeah.

2883
01:56:04.043 --> 01:56:06.579
TRAVIS: Sam could not make it, because he's stupid.

2884
01:56:06.579 --> 01:56:08.377
MATT: His stupid face.

2885
01:56:08.377 --> 01:56:09.252
TRAVIS: No, that's not the real reason.

2886
01:56:09.252 --> 01:56:12.230
Sam could not make it because he's too sexy.

2887
01:56:12.230 --> 01:56:14.206
MARISHA: That's a pretty good reason, yeah.

2888
01:56:14.206 --> 01:56:16.093
TRAVIS: Sam could not make it because his teeth

2889
01:56:16.093 --> 01:56:17.917
overtook the rest of his body.

2890
01:56:17.917 --> 01:56:19.203
MATT: Also, true, it's viable.

2891
01:56:19.203 --> 01:56:20.403
LIAM: (reading) Besides everything that has happened

2892
01:56:20.403 --> 01:56:24.244
to you guys with Critical Role,

2893
01:56:24.244 --> 01:56:26.561
what is something you were happy to have happen this year?

2894
01:56:26.561 --> 01:56:27.527
TALIESIN: Whoa.

2895
01:56:27.527 --> 01:56:28.909
MATT: Finally getting Ashley back.

2896
01:56:28.909 --> 01:56:31.576
(cheering)

2897
01:56:32.918 --> 01:56:33.802
For good.

2898
01:56:33.802 --> 01:56:35.526
ASHLEY: Yay.

2899
01:56:35.526 --> 01:56:36.887
TALIESIN and MATT: That's a big one.

2900
01:56:36.887 --> 01:56:40.113
TRAVIS: Having you guys fund an amazing Kickstarter

2901
01:56:40.113 --> 01:56:41.766
for our animated series.

2902
01:56:41.766 --> 01:56:42.608
ASHLEY: Heck yeah.

2903
01:56:42.608 --> 01:56:46.764
TRAVIS: I don't think we'll be forgetting that anytime soon.

2904
01:56:46.764 --> 01:56:48.983
LIAM: I enjoyed going to Burning Man

2905
01:56:48.983 --> 01:56:50.790
after hearing about it for eight years.

2906
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:52.369
(cheering)

2907
01:56:52.369 --> 01:56:54.882
MARISHA: Taking you out to Burning Man was pretty great.

2908
01:56:54.882 --> 01:56:56.098
LIAM: It was nice.

2909
01:56:56.098 --> 01:56:58.987
LAURA: I had a really, really good doughnut.

2910
01:56:58.987 --> 01:56:59.965
MATT: Yeah!

2911
01:56:59.965 --> 01:57:01.185
ASHLEY: Yes.

2912
01:57:01.185 --> 01:57:02.018
LAURA: So good.

2913
01:57:02.018 --> 01:57:03.814
TRAVIS: You mean, this year, one doughnut stands out?

2914
01:57:03.814 --> 01:57:04.647
LAURA: Yeah.

2915
01:57:05.888 --> 01:57:08.724
ASHLEY: Oh gosh, I think just coming home.

2916
01:57:08.724 --> 01:57:10.008
That's a big thing.

2917
01:57:10.008 --> 01:57:10.884
MARISHA: That's a huge thing.

2918
01:57:10.884 --> 01:57:12.345
ASHLEY: So yeah.

2919
01:57:12.345 --> 01:57:14.294
It's getting started.

2920
01:57:14.294 --> 01:57:15.612
Getting started being back home.

2921
01:57:15.612 --> 01:57:17.543
TRAVIS: You didn't have, like, a favorite cup of hot cocoa

2922
01:57:17.543 --> 01:57:20.159
or something?
ASHLEY: (sighs) Let's see.

2923
01:57:20.159 --> 01:57:22.999
I've had some pretty good cups of hot cocoa.

2924
01:57:22.999 --> 01:57:25.834
MATT: I enjoy seeing all of you guys without Sam.

2925
01:57:25.834 --> 01:57:28.371
That's a great moment right there.

2926
01:57:28.371 --> 01:57:29.677
MARISHA: Sam's calling you.

2927
01:57:29.677 --> 01:57:31.604
LIAM: Here's a question from Sam Riegel.

2928
01:57:31.604 --> 01:57:32.669
Oh, he's calling.

2929
01:57:32.669 --> 01:57:33.502
He's probably mad

2930
01:57:33.502 --> 01:57:35.069
that I'm not asking his questions.
MATT: I was joking, Sam.

2931
01:57:35.069 --> 01:57:39.400
(laughter)

2932
01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:40.233
No.

2933
01:57:41.651 --> 01:57:43.699
We love you, I was joking.

2934
01:57:43.699 --> 01:57:45.804
SAM: How dare you.

2935
01:57:45.804 --> 01:57:48.471
(laughter)

2936
01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:52.463
MATT: Why aren't you here?

2937
01:57:52.463 --> 01:57:53.894
LAURA: Ask him if he wants to answer a question.

2938
01:57:53.894 --> 01:57:57.529
SAM: I went to a party for my kids,

2939
01:57:57.529 --> 01:58:00.499
but the party never started, so I'm just sitting here

2940
01:58:00.499 --> 01:58:01.856
watching the stream.

2941
01:58:01.856 --> 01:58:04.348
(laughter)

2942
01:58:04.348 --> 01:58:06.643
LIAM: You sound like you're in a dentist's chair.

2943
01:58:06.643 --> 01:58:08.582
SAM: Just sitting here on a bench.

2944
01:58:08.582 --> 01:58:10.147
TRAVIS: I really hope somebody
comes up to you and goes like,

2945
01:58:10.147 --> 01:58:11.575
"Oh, you watch Critical Role?"

2946
01:58:11.575 --> 01:58:13.743
(laughter)

2947
01:58:13.743 --> 01:58:16.075
TALIESIN: Yep, if you get a
significant chunk of the audience,

2948
01:58:16.075 --> 01:58:18.311
you get a bonus.
MARISHA: Interesting.

2949
01:58:18.311 --> 01:58:19.252
MATT: Subway.

2950
01:58:19.252 --> 01:58:22.515
(laughter)

2951
01:58:22.515 --> 01:58:24.860
LAURA: Damn, they're both good.

2952
01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:26.359
GAME V.O.: Next up.

2953
01:58:26.359 --> 01:58:27.245
LIAM: Okay, this got dark.

2954
01:58:27.245 --> 01:58:28.829
GAME V.O.: The name of a cereal for serial killers.

2955
01:58:28.829 --> 01:58:29.992
MATT: Oh, well, we're on topic.

2956
01:58:29.992 --> 01:58:30.975
TALIESIN: Hey.

2957
01:58:30.975 --> 01:58:33.924
(groaning)

2958
01:58:33.924 --> 01:58:36.725
MATT: Oh yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: I mean, that's great.

2959
01:58:36.725 --> 01:58:38.532
TALIESIN: I don't understand, okay.

2960
01:58:38.532 --> 01:58:43.025
(laughter)

2961
01:58:43.025 --> 01:58:47.269
(laughter)

2962
01:58:47.269 --> 01:58:48.477
LAURA: Oh my god.

2963
01:58:48.477 --> 01:58:50.085
TALIESIN: Oh.

2964
01:58:50.085 --> 01:58:50.918
MATT: Oh man.

2965
01:58:50.918 --> 01:58:54.074
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, okay.
ASHLEY: That's tough.

2966
01:58:54.074 --> 01:58:55.749
ASHLEY: Whoa, that's good.

2967
01:58:55.749 --> 01:58:58.416
(laughter)

2968
01:59:01.672 --> 01:59:03.506
MATT: I would actually buy that.

2969
01:59:03.506 --> 01:59:04.907
Like, I would wear the shit out of

2970
01:59:04.907 --> 01:59:09.258
"It's five o'clock somewhere," three-humped camel.

2971
01:59:09.258 --> 01:59:10.925
GAME V.O.: Versus.

2972
01:59:12.009 --> 01:59:14.942
(laughter)

2973
01:59:14.942 --> 01:59:17.863
LIAM: Yes, yes!

2974
01:59:17.863 --> 01:59:19.634
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2975
01:59:19.634 --> 01:59:21.457
MARISHA: Oh no!

2976
01:59:21.457 --> 01:59:23.518
MATT: Have a wonderful holiday and a very happy new year.

2977
01:59:23.518 --> 01:59:24.834
LAURA: Merry Critmas.

2978
01:59:24.834 --> 01:59:28.444
LIAM: Remember, labia love ya, labia don't.

2979
01:59:29.448 --> 01:59:31.781
TRAVIS: Fucking asshole.
ASHLEY: Drop a deuce for Detroit.

2980
01:59:31.781 --> 01:59:33.185
MATT: Bye guys!

2981
01:59:38.059 --> 01:59:41.360
(mysterious music)

2982
01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:43.663
TALIESIN: Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

2983
01:59:43.663 --> 01:59:47.060
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

2984
01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:51.291
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

2985
01:59:51.291 --> 01:59:53.024
on the other side of

2986
01:59:53.024 --> 01:59:54.836
the fourth wall.

2987
01:59:54.836 --> 01:59:56.094
And what is this

2988
01:59:56.094 --> 01:59:57.311
fourth wall

2989
01:59:57.311 --> 01:59:59.795
separating the viewer from the creator?

2990
01:59:59.795 --> 02:00:02.521
A portal to an often-sought point of connection?

2991
02:00:02.521 --> 02:00:07.050
Or the Twitch Subscription Zone?

2992
02:00:07.050 --> 02:00:09.789
On the rare occasion that you miss the live bacchanal

2993
02:00:09.789 --> 02:00:13.504
boasted by the ragtag group of thespians on Thursday night,

2994
02:00:13.504 --> 02:00:15.737
you may always view the show on demand,

2995
02:00:15.737 --> 02:00:20.618
in the shadowland known as the Twitch Subscription Zone.

2996
02:00:20.618 --> 02:00:22.787
Picture, if you will, the necessary pieces

2997
02:00:22.787 --> 02:00:25.711
to complete a jigsaw puzzle, but it's up to you

2998
02:00:25.711 --> 02:00:28.398
to choose how it will be solved.

2999
02:00:28.398 --> 02:00:31.802
You could, of course, subscribe with your debt rectangle,

3000
02:00:31.802 --> 02:00:34.860
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

3001
02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.643
Perhaps you found yourself in possession

3002
02:00:36.643 --> 02:00:40.299
of an Amazon Prime account.

3003
02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:41.803
You would then wake up to discover

3004
02:00:41.803 --> 02:00:43.998
a free Twitch subscription each month

3005
02:00:43.998 --> 02:00:46.470
for a channel of your choosing.

3006
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:48.487
But this artifact demands renewal,

3007
02:00:48.487 --> 02:00:50.407
for you must resubscribe each month

3008
02:00:50.407 --> 02:00:53.315
to quench its unyielding thirst.

3009
02:00:53.315 --> 02:00:55.502
One need not walk alone.

3010
02:00:55.502 --> 02:00:57.406
Those who have already found their way

3011
02:00:57.406 --> 02:00:59.679
can illuminate the path for others

3012
02:00:59.679 --> 02:01:02.654
via the Gift a Sub button on Twitch.

3013
02:01:03.908 --> 02:01:06.653
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription,

3014
02:01:06.653 --> 02:01:10.230
and wishes to thank you from behind the thin veil of this

3015
02:01:10.230 --> 02:01:11.735
fourth wall.

3016
02:01:11.735 --> 02:01:15.254
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

3017
02:01:15.254 --> 02:01:18.165
And so ends another meandering digression,

3018
02:01:18.165 --> 02:01:21.667
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway,

3019
02:01:21.667 --> 02:01:26.667
to the region we call the Twitch Subscription Zone.

3020
02:01:26.949 --> 02:01:31.891
(eerie music)

3021
02:01:34.532 --> 02:01:36.482
You will subscribe.

3022
02:01:37.504 --> 02:01:40.439
Twitch Prime subscribe.

3023
02:01:40.439 --> 02:01:42.456
Gift Subscribe.

3024
02:01:43.985 --> 02:01:48.251

3025
02:01:54.442 --> 02:01:57.192
(dramatic music)

3026
02:14:58.636 --> 02:14:59.738
MATT: And welcome back.

3027
02:14:59.738 --> 02:15:03.661
So we have our winner of our break's giveaway

3028
02:15:03.661 --> 02:15:08.597

3029
02:15:08.597 --> 02:15:10.845
NobleKuahara.

3030
02:15:10.845 --> 02:15:13.415
NobleKuahara, congratulations, we'll contact you

3031
02:15:13.415 --> 02:15:15.580
and get that sent off ASAP, well won.

3032
02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:16.996
TRAVIS: Mother of noble Kuamar.

3033
02:15:16.996 --> 02:15:18.762
MATT: Indeed. All right.

3034
02:15:18.762 --> 02:15:20.689
MARISHA: They sound sexy.

3035
02:15:20.689 --> 02:15:21.740
MATT: Look at that.

3036
02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:23.009
Congratulations.

3037
02:15:23.009 --> 02:15:23.911
On two points.

3038
02:15:23.911 --> 02:15:25.057
TALIESIN: Power of a dice tray.

3039
02:15:25.057 --> 02:15:26.448
MATT: Indeed.

3040
02:15:26.448 --> 02:15:27.281
So.

3041
02:15:28.289 --> 02:15:31.504
Arriving at the Xhorhaus, entering through the front,

3042
02:15:31.504 --> 02:15:33.116
ding ding ding ding.

3043
02:15:33.116 --> 02:15:36.299
You return to a home that

3044
02:15:36.299 --> 02:15:38.305
is as you left it.

3045
02:15:38.305 --> 02:15:41.061
Housekeeper now missing. (chuckling)

3046
02:15:41.061 --> 02:15:42.475
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

3047
02:15:42.475 --> 02:15:47.186
MATT: But does not appear to have been entered or altered

3048
02:15:47.186 --> 02:15:49.030
since you were last here.

3049
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:50.208
SAM: I'm going to check for traps.

3050
02:15:50.208 --> 02:15:52.387
MARISHA: Yeah, doesn't appear to be?
I'm going to check for signs.

3051
02:15:52.387 --> 02:15:53.853
MATT: All right.

3052
02:15:53.853 --> 02:15:56.749
Investigation check for you, you're looking for what?

3053
02:15:56.749 --> 02:15:59.987
MARISHA: Signs of foot traffic or people.

3054
02:15:59.987 --> 02:16:01.517
SAM: 30.

3055
02:16:01.517 --> 02:16:03.274
MATT: 30, damn!

3056
02:16:03.274 --> 02:16:04.564
TRAVIS: Yep.

3057
02:16:04.564 --> 02:16:06.611
MARISHA: Dusting for prints.
MATT: All right.

3058
02:16:06.611 --> 02:16:07.927
MARISHA: What, investigation?

3059
02:16:07.927 --> 02:16:09.514
MATT: Hmm? It would be investigation, yeah.

3060
02:16:09.514 --> 02:16:12.009
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Dusting for prints.

3061
02:16:12.009 --> 02:16:13.284
MARISHA: 21.

3062
02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:16.515
MATT: All right.

3063
02:16:16.515 --> 02:16:19.163
Nothing out of the ordinary and no traps are found.

3064
02:16:19.163 --> 02:16:22.033
It is as you left it.

3065
02:16:22.033 --> 02:16:24.001
SAM: We're good to go.

3066
02:16:24.001 --> 02:16:25.789
LAURA: Hey, Yasha.

3067
02:16:25.789 --> 02:16:28.634
You're back.
ASHLEY: Wow, I have been here-- I'm back.

3068
02:16:28.634 --> 02:16:30.097
SAM: Have you been here before?

3069
02:16:30.097 --> 02:16:31.692
Yes, yes, yes, yes, you were here.

3070
02:16:31.692 --> 02:16:33.107
It's just hard to remember.
LAURA: Yeah, she hasn't been here

3071
02:16:33.107 --> 02:16:34.090
since, you know.

3072
02:16:34.090 --> 02:16:35.913
SAM: I know, I know, I'm sorry.

3073
02:16:37.038 --> 02:16:40.264
ASHLEY: I'm going to go up and see the mural again.

3074
02:16:40.264 --> 02:16:41.196
MATT: Okay.

3075
02:16:41.196 --> 02:16:43.331
As you guys enter, all of a sudden

3076
02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:48.331
Yasha pushes past and (quick footsteps).

3077
02:16:49.033 --> 02:16:52.167
You rush back into your old room, the mural is

3078
02:16:52.167 --> 02:16:54.313
as beautiful as you remember.

3079
02:16:54.313 --> 02:16:55.392
ASHLEY: (gasps)

3080
02:16:55.392 --> 02:16:57.398
I still can't find the dick.

3081
02:16:57.398 --> 02:17:00.065
(laughter)

3082
02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:04.039
I go back and yell over the stairs.

3083
02:17:04.039 --> 02:17:05.715
It's still beautiful, Jester!

3084
02:17:05.715 --> 02:17:09.539
LAURA: Oh good, I'm glad you still like it!

3085
02:17:09.539 --> 02:17:11.537
TALIESIN: I'm going to go upstairs and change into something

3086
02:17:11.537 --> 02:17:13.230
less comfortable, I'll be right back.

3087
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:14.658
MARISHA: Less comfortable?

3088
02:17:14.658 --> 02:17:16.311
SAM: Well yeah, because we're in robes.
MARISHA: Oh.

3089
02:17:16.311 --> 02:17:18.882
TRAVIS: Could somebody please drop this, for fuck's sake?

3090
02:17:18.882 --> 02:17:21.992
LIAM: Sure, just a moment longer.

3091
02:17:21.992 --> 02:17:26.292
SAM: It takes a while to undo magic, Fjord.

3092
02:17:26.292 --> 02:17:28.037
MARISHA: I guess I get dressed, too.

3093
02:17:28.037 --> 02:17:30.898
LAURA: You could make him look like
he's wearing anything, huh?

3094
02:17:30.898 --> 02:17:31.922
LIAM: Next time.

3095
02:17:31.922 --> 02:17:33.436
MATT: Well, as you guys all get changed,

3096
02:17:33.436 --> 02:17:36.364
you're still, you visually are appearing your attire,

3097
02:17:36.364 --> 02:17:39.104
and it feels strange to get dressed into an outfit

3098
02:17:39.104 --> 02:17:41.859
that you already look like.

3099
02:17:41.859 --> 02:17:42.854
TRAVIS: Just sinking in.

3100
02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:45.548
MATT: Yeah, it takes a little bit of coordination

3101
02:17:45.548 --> 02:17:47.440
to get it right.

3102
02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:50.093
But nevertheless, you all manage to achieve it.

3103
02:17:50.093 --> 02:17:51.887
LAURA: That's true, you couldn't tell

3104
02:17:51.887 --> 02:17:54.179
if it's actually buckled, or if it's not.

3105
02:17:54.179 --> 02:17:57.724
It feels loose, but it looks right.

3106
02:17:57.724 --> 02:17:59.481
MARISHA: Video game graphics.
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

3107
02:17:59.481 --> 02:18:01.259
Doesn't quite fit the model.

3108
02:18:01.259 --> 02:18:02.311
MARISHA: Yeah.

3109
02:18:02.311 --> 02:18:03.720
SAM: What time of day is it?

3110
02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:06.508
MATT: It's challenging to make
female models in games, you know.

3111
02:18:06.508 --> 02:18:08.759
MARISHA: You know, just pick one.

3112
02:18:08.759 --> 02:18:10.718
TALIESIN: Well, it's nighttime, no matter what.

3113
02:18:10.718 --> 02:18:11.918
SAM: Oh yeah.

3114
02:18:11.918 --> 02:18:12.842
MATT: Yeah.

3115
02:18:12.842 --> 02:18:14.716
And with the time difference, I'd say

3116
02:18:14.716 --> 02:18:16.592
it's a little later in the day.

3117
02:18:16.592 --> 02:18:19.504
So it would be the equivalent, you would surmise

3118
02:18:19.504 --> 02:18:23.483
at this point after your spa day experience,

3119
02:18:23.483 --> 02:18:25.503
probably late afternoon.

3120
02:18:25.503 --> 02:18:26.454
LAURA: Oh, shit.

3121
02:18:26.454 --> 02:18:27.828
SAM: Good time to drop in.

3122
02:18:27.828 --> 02:18:30.128
LAURA: We should send her a message.

3123
02:18:30.128 --> 02:18:31.896
Should I send a message to her,

3124
02:18:31.896 --> 02:18:34.805
or Essek, like, maybe he should tell her

3125
02:18:34.805 --> 02:18:36.267
that we want to talk to her?

3126
02:18:36.267 --> 02:18:37.192
TALIESIN: That would be the way to go.

3127
02:18:37.192 --> 02:18:39.784
LAURA: That's probably proper protocol, yeah?

3128
02:18:39.784 --> 02:18:41.072
TALIESIN: That would be what I would do.

3129
02:18:41.072 --> 02:18:45.855
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send a message to Essek.

3130
02:18:45.855 --> 02:18:46.893
MATT: All righty.

3131
02:18:50.359 --> 02:18:53.025
LAURA: Guess who's back!

3132
02:18:53.025 --> 02:18:55.636
We're back at the Xhorhaus.

3133
02:18:55.636 --> 02:18:56.876
We miss you so much.

3134
02:18:56.876 --> 02:18:59.979
We need to talk to the Bright Queen, are you around?

3135
02:18:59.979 --> 02:19:03.087
Oh my gosh, you have to

3136
02:19:03.087 --> 02:19:06.925
hear about everything,

3137
02:19:06.925 --> 02:19:10.358
that's one word, that, there.

3138
02:19:10.358 --> 02:19:13.025
(laughter)

3139
02:19:16.569 --> 02:19:20.372
MATT: "Well, welcome back, it is good to have you returned.

3140
02:19:20.372 --> 02:19:22.747
"Give me just a moment, please."

3141
02:19:24.296 --> 02:19:27.359
And as you guys can gather yourselves a bit,

3142
02:19:27.359 --> 02:19:29.504
it's a patient 45 minutes or so

3143
02:19:29.504 --> 02:19:32.797
before Essek makes his way to your door, you--

3144
02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:35.586
LAURA: Four to five minutes or 45 minutes?

3145
02:19:35.586 --> 02:19:36.506
MATT: 45.

3146
02:19:36.506 --> 02:19:37.981
LAURA: 45.
SAM: It's a power move.

3147
02:19:37.981 --> 02:19:39.980
LIAM: Seven hours left on the Seeming spell.

3148
02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:41.953
(laughter)

3149
02:19:41.953 --> 02:19:43.229
MATT: You haven't dropped it?

3150
02:19:43.229 --> 02:19:45.066
LIAM: Not yet.
MATT: Okay.

3151
02:19:45.066 --> 02:19:47.733
(knocking)

3152
02:19:48.996 --> 02:19:49.996
SAM: Who is it?

3153
02:19:51.967 --> 02:19:53.884
MATT: "It's the Shadowhand."

3154
02:19:55.229 --> 02:19:56.551
MARISHA: Still a cool title.

3155
02:19:56.551 --> 02:19:59.850
SAM: I'll use my Mage Hand to open the door.

3156
02:19:59.850 --> 02:20:04.723
MATT: (creaking) Opens, and he drifts in, yep.
TALIESIN: (tinking) Thank you.

3157
02:20:04.723 --> 02:20:09.723
MATT: "Well, you all look well.

3158
02:20:09.939 --> 02:20:11.789
"Sorry if it is the wrong time,

3159
02:20:11.789 --> 02:20:13.964
"I can come back."
TRAVIS: No, it's not real. I--

3160
02:20:13.964 --> 02:20:16.536
(sputtering)

3161
02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:18.850
LAURA: (laughs)

3162
02:20:18.850 --> 02:20:21.929
LIAM: Well, now I feel bad.

3163
02:20:21.929 --> 02:20:25.288
MATT: "(laughs) Well played."

3164
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:29.262
LAURA: Are you okay, Essek?

3165
02:20:29.262 --> 02:20:30.792
MATT: "Ah, yes."

3166
02:20:30.792 --> 02:20:32.754
He looks a little sleep deprived.

3167
02:20:32.754 --> 02:20:34.489
Like he looks a little weary.

3168
02:20:34.489 --> 02:20:38.145
SAM: Everything okay here in Rosohna?

3169
02:20:38.145 --> 02:20:41.920
MATT: "Well, everything is

3170
02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:44.220
"all right, I suppose.

he was part of it!

SAM: Oh, wait, wait.

3208
02:22:40.336 --> 02:22:42.465
LAURA: Is that why you look so sleepy?

3209
02:22:42.465 --> 02:22:44.356
MATT: "There's been a lot of work to be done, yes."

3210
02:22:44.356 --> 02:22:46.718
SAM: So was he the source of the intelligence

3211
02:22:46.718 --> 02:22:49.844
that the beacon was in Rexxentrum to begin with?

3212
02:22:49.844 --> 02:22:52.684

MATT: "That's great news."

3232
02:23:51.418 --> 02:23:53.783

with the cult, I'm sure, but a big huge part of it.

3236
02:24:06.488 --> 02:24:09.238
TALIESIN: And Vence is also on the run now,

3237
02:24:09.238 --> 02:24:12.714
on the other side of the conflict.

3238
02:24:12.714 --> 02:24:15.485
TRAVIS: I think you should also know we uncovered a shackle,

3239
02:24:15.485 --> 02:24:19.775
one of the things keeping the Chained Oblivion at bay.

3240
02:24:19.775 --> 02:24:22.606
MATT: "This is what this Allura
had said to the Bright Queen,

3241
02:24:22.606 --> 02:24:27.248
"and had made the request for this temporary ceasefire.

3242
02:24:28.852 --> 02:24:32.085
"Also, as you inferred to me,

3243
02:24:32.994 --> 02:24:37.360
"this other individual that may have been working

3244
02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:40.243
"within our midst to provide the beacons to the Empire,

3245
02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:42.884
"Adeen also...

3246
02:24:45.425 --> 02:24:50.011
"confessed to secretly trading away these beacons."

3247
02:24:50.011 --> 02:24:53.698
SAM: They must have been very high up in the hierarchy

3248
02:24:53.698 --> 02:24:55.354
to have access to these things.

3249
02:24:55.354 --> 02:24:57.321
MARISHA: And why haven't we heard of him before,

3250
02:24:57.321 --> 02:24:58.352
if that's the case?

3251
02:24:58.352 --> 02:25:00.290
How did we miss this guy?

3252
02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:03.373
MATT: "There are many dens;
you've only encountered but a few."

3253
02:25:03.373 --> 02:25:05.643
LIAM: How long have you had him in custody for questioning?

3254
02:25:05.643 --> 02:25:07.287
MATT: "Two days."

3255
02:25:07.287 --> 02:25:09.829
LIAM: Any idea of-- hello.

3256
02:25:10.799 --> 02:25:13.839
Any idea of accomplices?

3257
02:25:13.839 --> 02:25:15.972
MATT: "We are working on that at the moment.

3258
02:25:15.972 --> 02:25:20.016
"He's currently imprisoned and is being held

3259
02:25:20.016 --> 02:25:23.017
"awaiting judgment from the Bright Queen.

3260
02:25:23.017 --> 02:25:25.118
"Once we've exhausted our interrogations

3261
02:25:25.118 --> 02:25:28.070
"and find no more purpose, that is where he will go.

3262
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:30.566
TRAVIS: Traded away beacons?

3263
02:25:30.566 --> 02:25:32.897
LAURA: What did he get in return?

3264
02:25:32.897 --> 02:25:36.940
MATT: "That is something we are currently seeking.

3265
02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:41.599
"It would seem perhaps access to this Empire figure,

3266
02:25:41.599 --> 02:25:45.489
"perhaps something to do with the cult itself.

3267
02:25:45.489 --> 02:25:46.822
"We are not sure."

3268
02:25:47.749 --> 02:25:50.325
MARISHA: Which Empire figure? Vence?

3269
02:25:50.325 --> 02:25:51.548
MATT: "Possibly."

3270
02:25:51.548 --> 02:25:55.345
TRAVIS: Do you know how many beacons, or just one?

3271
02:25:55.345 --> 02:25:59.492
MATT: "The two that we were originally missing."

3272
02:25:59.492 --> 02:26:02.522
TALIESIN: That's going to be a conversation.

3273
02:26:02.522 --> 02:26:06.083
MATT: "I have not yet informed the queen of these findings,

3274
02:26:06.083 --> 02:26:11.075
"as this was a recent acquisition."

3275
02:26:12.468 --> 02:26:14.709
LAURA: You've had him for two days, though?

3276
02:26:14.709 --> 02:26:16.812
MATT: "We've had him for two days, but we've only recently

3277
02:26:16.812 --> 02:26:19.212
"been able to get this information out of him."

3278
02:26:19.212 --> 02:26:21.073
MARISHA: So she doesn't even--

3279
02:26:21.073 --> 02:26:22.490
MATT: "She's about to."

3280
02:26:23.505 --> 02:26:24.865
TALIESIN: Well.

3281
02:26:24.865 --> 02:26:27.015
SAM: We have some information for her as well.

3282
02:26:27.015 --> 02:26:29.454
Maybe we should lay it all on her at once?

3283
02:26:29.454 --> 02:26:30.287
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

3284
02:26:31.466 --> 02:26:32.701
MATT: "Very well.

3285
02:26:32.701 --> 02:26:35.499
"When are you ready to speak to her?"

3286
02:26:35.499 --> 02:26:36.355
LAURA: I mean--

3287
02:26:36.355 --> 02:26:38.864
TRAVIS: Is there any reason why you haven't told her yet?

3288
02:26:38.864 --> 02:26:41.473
Are you trying to confirm or gather, or?

3289
02:26:41.473 --> 02:26:44.373
MATT: "I was-- If you're going to,

3290
02:26:44.373 --> 02:26:48.097
"in a point of extreme tensions

3291
02:26:48.097 --> 02:26:50.809
"in warfare in which the queen is impatiently waiting

3292
02:26:50.809 --> 02:26:53.824
"for any sort of concrete proof

3293
02:26:53.824 --> 02:26:56.019
"as to why the ceasefire was necessary,

3294
02:26:56.019 --> 02:26:57.708
"we wanted to make sure that we presented it

3295
02:26:57.708 --> 02:27:00.767
"as an entire package, as opposed to piecemeal.

3296
02:27:00.767 --> 02:27:05.698
"It is better, and also we need to cross our Ts as well,

3297
02:27:05.698 --> 02:27:08.657
"in the instance that perhaps any
of this information is incorrect."

3298
02:27:08.657 --> 02:27:11.218
TRAVIS: You've done very, very well by us.

3299
02:27:11.218 --> 02:27:13.839
Would you care to hear what we would have to say now,

3300
02:27:13.839 --> 02:27:15.631
so it doesn't catch you by surprise?

3301
02:27:15.631 --> 02:27:17.676
MATT: "Please."

3302
02:27:17.676 --> 02:27:20.508
TRAVIS: We can confirm that the Empire does indeed

3303
02:27:20.508 --> 02:27:24.698
have one of these beacons. We've seen it.

3304
02:27:24.698 --> 02:27:27.031
MATT: "Whereabouts is it located?"

3305
02:27:28.877 --> 02:27:31.301
MARISHA: North of Rexxentrum.

3306
02:27:31.301 --> 02:27:32.972
LIAM: Outside of the city.

3307
02:27:32.972 --> 02:27:34.550
LAURA: We don't know the exact location,

3308
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:37.463
they teleported us there.

3309
02:27:37.463 --> 02:27:38.685
MATT: "Right.

3310
02:27:38.685 --> 02:27:41.674
"Is it a place that can be accessed, perhaps?

3311
02:27:41.674 --> 02:27:44.033
"Maybe via purple worm?"

3312
02:27:44.033 --> 02:27:46.721
SAM: Yes, but you may not need to.

3313
02:27:46.721 --> 02:27:50.587
They've agreed to give it back.

3314
02:27:51.724 --> 02:27:54.246
MATT: "In exchange for what?"

3315
02:27:54.246 --> 02:27:56.596
LAURA: Peace talks.
SAM: A meeting.

3316
02:27:58.399 --> 02:28:01.862
LIAM: Supposedly to perhaps ease tensions

3317
02:28:01.862 --> 02:28:04.590
between the two nations.

3318
02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:09.126
And we are as skeptical as you seem to be now,

3319
02:28:09.126 --> 02:28:11.834
but it still seemed like an opportunity.

3320
02:28:11.834 --> 02:28:13.101
MATT: "Indeed.

3321
02:28:14.325 --> 02:28:17.043
"Curious what it is they want, or what it is

3322
02:28:17.043 --> 02:28:19.743
"we're not seeing here, but

3323
02:28:19.743 --> 02:28:21.847
"if it stems the spilling of blood

3324
02:28:21.847 --> 02:28:26.024
"for the time being, it should at least be entertained.

3325
02:28:26.024 --> 02:28:26.958
"Hopefully."

3326
02:28:26.958 --> 02:28:30.268
LIAM: We have suggested to them a neutral location,

3327
02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:33.476
neither here nor there.

3328
02:28:33.476 --> 02:28:37.659
Just so that no one would unduly have the upper hand.

3329
02:28:38.601 --> 02:28:41.775
We are cautious, though,

3330
02:28:41.775 --> 02:28:44.208
and are loathe to bring

3331
02:28:44.208 --> 02:28:46.122
any danger here.

3332
02:28:47.705 --> 02:28:50.753
It seems like a difficult path still,

3333
02:28:50.753 --> 02:28:54.669
but we would like you

3334
02:28:54.669 --> 02:28:57.927
and the queen to entertain

3335
02:28:59.744 --> 02:29:03.769
the idea of easing tensions here.

3336
02:29:04.642 --> 02:29:08.844
I know how hard line she seems to be,

3337
02:29:08.844 --> 02:29:11.804
and it is not unfounded, we understand.

3338
02:29:11.804 --> 02:29:14.844
MATT: "She has seen a lot of bloodshed in her years,

3339
02:29:14.844 --> 02:29:17.749
"and I understand where she's coming from.

3340
02:29:17.749 --> 02:29:22.041
"But I think it's worth a conversation.

3341
02:29:23.189 --> 02:29:25.012
"Mind you, for such a negotiation,

3342
02:29:25.012 --> 02:29:29.606
"there would be no personal appearance by her.

3343
02:29:29.606 --> 02:29:33.389
"It would have to be proxies and emissaries,

3344
02:29:33.389 --> 02:29:37.156
"and probably speak via mirror of some sort

3345
02:29:37.156 --> 02:29:40.493
"of distance conversation or point at the place.

3346
02:29:40.493 --> 02:29:43.018
"At least these negotiations, if agreed upon,

3347
02:29:43.018 --> 02:29:45.116
"these transferences could take place."

3348
02:29:45.116 --> 02:29:47.761
LAURA: Like a FaceTime talking to another FaceTime?

3349
02:29:47.761 --> 02:29:48.685
SAM: Hold it up.

3350
02:29:48.685 --> 02:29:50.035
LAURA: Like that?

3351
02:29:50.971 --> 02:29:54.198
MATT: "I assume that is something of a similar thing

3352
02:29:54.198 --> 02:29:55.824
"as the mirrors, but probably."

3353
02:29:55.824 --> 02:29:59.723
SAM: We just were holding up two porn books, by the way.

3354
02:29:59.723 --> 02:30:00.689
MATT: "I'm not judging."

3355
02:30:00.689 --> 02:30:02.535
MARISHA: FaceTime is a great series.

3356
02:30:02.535 --> 02:30:04.705
(laughter)

3357
02:30:04.705 --> 02:30:06.400
SAM: It's a lot of mouth stuff.

3358
02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:09.293
(laughter)

3359
02:30:09.293 --> 02:30:10.555
MATT: It's in the YA section.

3360
02:30:10.555 --> 02:30:13.222
(laughter)

3361
02:30:15.197 --> 02:30:17.840
TRAVIS: You mentioned crossing your Ts.

3362
02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:22.000
I wonder if perhaps, would it be foolish of us

3363
02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:26.833
to think that an audience might be had with your prisoner?

3364
02:30:28.984 --> 02:30:33.934
We were firsthand with more of these Angel of Iron cultists.

3365
02:30:33.934 --> 02:30:36.900
I wonder how they might react to knowing

3366
02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:40.445
that prominent figures have been dealt with,

3367
02:30:40.445 --> 02:30:42.170
done, squandered.

3368
02:30:44.495 --> 02:30:45.995
MATT: "That could probably be done.

3369
02:30:45.995 --> 02:30:50.070
"I have to pull some strings, but it could--

3370
02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:53.925
"It would need to be just a--"
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god, you know what else we could do?

3371
02:30:53.925 --> 02:30:54.758
SAM: What?

3372
02:30:54.758 --> 02:30:56.850
LAURA: Oh my god, okay, okay, okay. What if--

3373
02:30:56.850 --> 02:30:59.307
TRAVIS: There's a 50/50 chance this is ridiculous.

3374
02:30:59.307 --> 02:31:04.307
LAURA: What if one of us can make ourselves look like Vence.

3375
02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:05.727
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

3376
02:31:05.727 --> 02:31:09.523
LAURA: Like we've been caught, and you could throw him

3377
02:31:09.523 --> 02:31:13.726
in the cell next to your guy, and like,

3378
02:31:13.726 --> 02:31:15.566
leave them alone a little bit, so that

3379
02:31:15.566 --> 02:31:18.533
they could talk to each other.

3380
02:31:18.533 --> 02:31:21.014
Maybe get some more information.

3381
02:31:21.014 --> 02:31:23.220
SAM: Do we know how Vence talks?

3382
02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:25.269
MARISHA: We saw him in that vision once,

3383
02:31:25.269 --> 02:31:28.702
and he was talking to a FaceTime.

3384
02:31:28.702 --> 02:31:30.303
LIAM: Did he have a Zemnian accent?

3385
02:31:30.303 --> 02:31:31.837
SAM: Someone was sitting on his face.

3386
02:31:31.837 --> 02:31:33.837
MATT: I believe he did, yes.

3387
02:31:35.440 --> 02:31:37.599
"You can certainly try, but we have to do it soon.

3388
02:31:37.599 --> 02:31:40.627
"He's supposed to be given over for--"

3389
02:31:40.627 --> 02:31:43.048
LAURA: If your guy has talked to Obann,

3390
02:31:43.048 --> 02:31:45.555
maybe one of us could make ourselves look like Obann.

3391
02:31:45.555 --> 02:31:46.590
We know what he talks like.

3392
02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:47.648
MATT: "That is also possible."

3393
02:31:47.648 --> 02:31:50.366
TRAVIS: How would Obann go down in the cell?

3394
02:31:50.366 --> 02:31:52.103
LAURA: That's true, that's stupid.
SAM: He wouldn't be thrown in jail, but Vence,

3395
02:31:52.103 --> 02:31:53.170
Vence is a good idea.

3396
02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:55.674
LIAM: The first idea is sound.
LAURA: Okay, okay.

3397
02:31:55.674 --> 02:31:57.004
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

3398
02:31:57.004 --> 02:32:00.599
SAM: Make it so that it looks like
his throat has been slashed and he's raspy.

3399
02:32:00.599 --> 02:32:01.664
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

3400
02:32:01.664 --> 02:32:03.656
MATT: "It would be much easier to bring one person

3401
02:32:03.656 --> 02:32:06.116
"into the prison than seven."

3402
02:32:06.116 --> 02:32:07.178
LAURA: True.
TALIESIN: Agreed.

3403
02:32:07.178 --> 02:32:09.718
MATT: "So who would be the one to make this attempt?"

3404
02:32:09.718 --> 02:32:13.049
SAM: I mean, I can change how I appear.

3405
02:32:13.049 --> 02:32:15.410
LAURA: Probably Fjord is really good

3406
02:32:15.410 --> 02:32:17.741
at sounding like other people.
SAM: I mean, that would've been my second choice, yes.

3407
02:32:17.741 --> 02:32:19.715
MATT: "It has been your specialty in the past."

3408
02:32:19.715 --> 02:32:21.024
TRAVIS: Yes, yeah.

3409
02:32:21.024 --> 02:32:22.723
Oh, I don't want to do it. (laughing)

3410
02:32:22.723 --> 02:32:25.530
SAM: You might have to shave your beard, though.

3411
02:32:25.530 --> 02:32:28.127
TRAVIS: I can make myself look like other people.

3412
02:32:28.127 --> 02:32:31.279
MARISHA: I could always come in
and punch him in the face, too--

3413
02:32:31.279 --> 02:32:32.966
MATT: "Trust me, there's been
plenty of punching for two days,

3414
02:32:32.966 --> 02:32:34.719
"I do not think that you would maybe--"

3415
02:32:34.719 --> 02:32:39.000
MARISHA: But do they have magical
punches that make people talk?

3416
02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.769
MATT: "We have magical means of forcing the truth,

3417
02:32:41.769 --> 02:32:43.140
"if that's what you're talking about."

3418
02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:45.414
MARISHA: Fuck, whatever, yeah, let's do this plan.

3419
02:32:45.414 --> 02:32:47.049
TRAVIS: Yeah.
(Matt laughing)

3420
02:32:47.049 --> 02:32:47.952
SAM: That was a good plan.

3421
02:32:47.952 --> 02:32:50.959
TRAVIS: I need to know everything about Vence.

3422
02:32:50.959 --> 02:32:52.875
How tall is he, what did he look like,

3423
02:32:52.875 --> 02:32:53.891
what did he sound like?

3424
02:32:53.891 --> 02:32:58.126
LAURA: I tell you exactly, I draw him in my most

3425
02:32:58.126 --> 02:33:00.309
photorealistic way of drawing.

3426
02:33:00.309 --> 02:33:02.397
SAM: Ooh, we know what he wore.

3427
02:33:02.397 --> 02:33:03.516
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3428
02:33:03.516 --> 02:33:05.728
MARISHA: Here's that swath of fabric that we had.

3429
02:33:05.728 --> 02:33:09.442
SAM: I will give you my-- well, you'd have to change.

3430
02:33:09.442 --> 02:33:11.776
I could give you my armor that can change into any--

3431
02:33:11.776 --> 02:33:13.996
oh wait, we're going to change your appearance, we're fine.

3432
02:33:13.996 --> 02:33:15.876
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Mask of Many Faces.

3433
02:33:15.876 --> 02:33:17.405
LIAM: Could you make yourself look like him for a moment?

3434
02:33:17.405 --> 02:33:18.631
LAURA: Could I make my--?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

3435
02:33:18.631 --> 02:33:20.317
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

3436
02:33:20.317 --> 02:33:23.213
Yeah, I'm going to go Disguise Self as him.

3437
02:33:23.213 --> 02:33:27.398
To make height, everything, absolutely perfect.

3438
02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:30.674
This is what I look like, my name is Vence,

3439
02:33:30.674 --> 02:33:33.634
I'm an idiot, am a cultist and stuff.

3440
02:33:33.634 --> 02:33:35.025
TRAVIS: That's nice.

3441
02:33:35.025 --> 02:33:38.091
LAURA: I don't actually sound like this.

3442
02:33:38.091 --> 02:33:39.532
TRAVIS: Did he have a Zemnian accent?

3443
02:33:39.532 --> 02:33:41.098
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
TRAVIS: He did.

3444
02:33:42.221 --> 02:33:47.221
MARISHA: And his boss is Ludinus.

3445
02:33:48.023 --> 02:33:50.505
TRAVIS: You have "nachos" written in your notes.

3446
02:33:50.505 --> 02:33:52.410
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

3447
02:33:53.647 --> 02:33:55.958
TRAVIS: It was the shard sticking out of the--

3448
02:33:55.958 --> 02:33:57.580
MATT: Oh yeah, the Barbed Fields, yeah.

3449
02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:59.638
LIAM: What was the word, I'm blanking on it,

3450
02:33:59.638 --> 02:34:01.761
for what Vence was?

3451
02:34:01.761 --> 02:34:05.149
He's not in succession to be part of the Assembly,

3452
02:34:05.149 --> 02:34:08.003
but he's like one of their right-hand people.

3453
02:34:08.003 --> 02:34:08.851
There's a word.

3454
02:34:08.851 --> 02:34:10.072
MATT: Correct, correct.

3455
02:34:10.072 --> 02:34:11.443
I'm trying to remember off the top of my head,

3456
02:34:11.443 --> 02:34:13.144
it's been a while.

3457
02:34:13.144 --> 02:34:14.470
LAURA: ♪ Been a while ♪

3458
02:34:14.470 --> 02:34:15.628
MATT: ♪ Been a while ♪

3459
02:34:15.628 --> 02:34:17.964
MARISHA: I also wrote down the entire conversation

3460
02:34:17.964 --> 02:34:19.955
somewhere in here.

3461
02:34:19.955 --> 02:34:20.888
Fuck, I don't--

3462
02:34:20.888 --> 02:34:21.887
LIAM: It's one of those.

3463
02:34:21.887 --> 02:34:23.035
MARISHA: God dammit, so much.

3464
02:34:23.035 --> 02:34:24.039
TRAVIS: Because I take such brilliant notes,

3465
02:34:24.039 --> 02:34:26.954
your prisoner's name again is?

3466
02:34:26.954 --> 02:34:29.220
MATT: "Ah, the prisoner's name was

3467
02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:33.257
"Taskhand Adeen Tasithar."

3468
02:34:33.257 --> 02:34:35.916
TRAVIS: Tasithar.

3469
02:34:35.916 --> 02:34:37.771
Did you say Cask Hand?

3470
02:34:37.771 --> 02:34:40.072
MATT: Taskhand.
SAM: Taskhand.

3471
02:34:40.072 --> 02:34:41.315
TRAVIS: With a T?

3472
02:34:41.315 --> 02:34:44.948
MATT: T-A-S-K-H-A-N-D.

3473
02:34:46.307 --> 02:34:48.858
TRAVIS: Taskhand Adeen Tasithar.

3474
02:34:48.858 --> 02:34:50.207
MATT: Tasithar.

3475
02:34:50.207 --> 02:34:52.582
SAM: Taskhand Ass Pants.

3476
02:34:54.990 --> 02:34:58.107
TRAVIS: I was hearing Gas Can, all sorts of shit.

3477
02:34:58.107 --> 02:34:59.472
MATT: "If you're to attempt this, I would recommend

3478
02:34:59.472 --> 02:35:00.722
"doing it soon.

3479
02:35:01.972 --> 02:35:04.332
"The longer this information stays unspoken

3480
02:35:04.332 --> 02:35:06.556
"to the Bright Queen, as well as your own concerns--"

3481
02:35:06.556 --> 02:35:07.914
LAURA: We should do it right away.

3482
02:35:07.914 --> 02:35:10.437
MATT: "-- the more tenuous this ceasefire becomes.

3483
02:35:10.437 --> 02:35:13.439
"The forces that were withdrawn from Rexxentrum

3484
02:35:13.439 --> 02:35:15.443
"are still beneath it. They did not return."

3485
02:35:15.443 --> 02:35:16.315
(Laura gasps)

3486
02:35:16.315 --> 02:35:17.148
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

3487
02:35:17.148 --> 02:35:19.514
MATT: "They are just awaiting word to continue."
LAURA: Oh.

3488
02:35:19.514 --> 02:35:21.091
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're still in place.
LAURA: They're still there.

3489
02:35:21.091 --> 02:35:22.711
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're waiting to strike.

3490
02:35:22.711 --> 02:35:25.148
LAURA: The purple worms are still under the city!

3491
02:35:25.148 --> 02:35:27.259
TRAVIS: The Taskhand, when he was ambushed and taken,

3492
02:35:27.259 --> 02:35:29.227
was he given reason for his capture?

3493
02:35:29.227 --> 02:35:31.709
Does he know that an operation was thwarted,

3494
02:35:31.709 --> 02:35:33.452
they were onto him, or--

3495
02:35:33.452 --> 02:35:38.402
MATT: "All of this has been given,
elements of it,

3496
02:35:38.402 --> 02:35:41.830
"to attempt to force them
to fill in the blanks,

3497
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:43.905
"to prove our...

02:35:46.972 --> 02:35:51.046
"curiosity and let them prove

3499
02:35:51.046 --> 02:35:52.859
"that they were involved."

3500
02:35:52.859 --> 02:35:55.370
TRAVIS: Has he done the normal
thing of holding his tongue,

3501
02:35:55.370 --> 02:35:57.510
or has he been forthcoming, do you know?

3502
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:59.909
MATT: "Long threatening to not know
what we're talking about,

3503
02:35:59.909 --> 02:36:04.701
"and demanding to be released.

3504
02:36:04.701 --> 02:36:09.059
"But upon magical inquiries,

"forcing of one's will,
and through physical...

02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:13.733
"persuasion,

02:36:13.733 --> 02:36:16.657
"we managed to excise the truth,

3508
02:36:16.657 --> 02:36:21.599
"and the Taskhand has given
his hand, if you will."

3509
02:36:24.590 --> 02:36:26.649
TRAVIS: I have Friends as a
cantrip and I've never used it.

3510
02:36:26.649 --> 02:36:28.814
How the fuck does that work?

3511
02:36:28.814 --> 02:36:29.994
SAM: You could cast it.

3512
02:36:29.994 --> 02:36:33.255
LAURA: You can't cast it when
you're in there, probably.

3513
02:36:33.255 --> 02:36:34.997
Oh, I have it, wait, hold on, hold on.

3514
02:36:34.997 --> 02:36:36.382
TALIESIN: Yeah, you have it, I don't.

3515
02:36:36.382 --> 02:36:37.545
TRAVIS: Is it on a person?

3516
02:36:37.545 --> 02:36:40.005
SAM: You cast it on the person,
and it gives you advantage

3517
02:36:40.005 --> 02:36:41.689
on charisma checks.

3518
02:36:41.689 --> 02:36:44.408
TRAVIS: It says "self," I cast it on myself.

3519
02:36:44.408 --> 02:36:45.861
SAM: Oh.

3520
02:36:45.861 --> 02:36:47.697
LIAM: Yeah, it just gives you advantage for--

3521
02:36:47.697 --> 02:36:49.206
TRAVIS: Charisma checks?
LIAM: Yeah.

3522
02:36:49.206 --> 02:36:50.992
TRAVIS: Okay.

3523
02:36:50.992 --> 02:36:53.555
SAM: Caleb could use Seeming on you,

3524
02:36:53.555 --> 02:36:56.272
and then you would be free to cast spells.

3525
02:36:56.272 --> 02:36:57.750
LIAM: For hours, yeah.

3526
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:59.212
If that's what we should do.

3527
02:36:59.212 --> 02:37:01.440
TALIESIN: For a different type of interrogation.

3528
02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:03.561
TRAVIS: I can do Mask of Many Faces without

3529
02:37:03.561 --> 02:37:05.329
knocking out a concentration spell.

3530
02:37:05.329 --> 02:37:06.604
SAM: Oh, okay.

3531
02:37:08.173 --> 02:37:09.173
What's that?

3532
02:37:10.062 --> 02:37:12.299
LIAM: Friends is-- you have it?

3533
02:37:12.299 --> 02:37:13.132
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3534
02:37:13.132 --> 02:37:14.315
LIAM: It's one minute.

3535
02:37:14.315 --> 02:37:16.401
MATT: And I believe at the end
of the minute, they know--

3536
02:37:16.401 --> 02:37:17.483
LIAM: They know.
LAURA: Yeah.

3537
02:37:17.483 --> 02:37:19.075
MATT: They've had a spell affect their mind.

3538
02:37:19.075 --> 02:37:20.142
TRAVIS: So I have Command--

3539
02:37:20.142 --> 02:37:22.188
LAURA: I'm going to give you Enhance Ability

3540
02:37:22.188 --> 02:37:23.777
when you're about to go in, that gives you

3541
02:37:23.777 --> 02:37:25.862
advantage on charisma checks for an hour.

3542
02:37:25.862 --> 02:37:27.492
MATT: That is nice.

3543
02:37:27.492 --> 02:37:29.359
SAM: And maybe, Caleb, you could give him

3544
02:37:29.359 --> 02:37:31.225
an extra stroke of luck.

3545
02:37:31.225 --> 02:37:33.365
LIAM: Planning to do that.

3546
02:37:33.365 --> 02:37:38.182
MARISHA: Okay, I found my notes on that conversation

3547
02:37:38.182 --> 02:37:43.182
that Jester was relaying
when she was scrying on Vence.

3548
02:37:43.257 --> 02:37:44.432
They mentioned--

3549
02:37:44.432 --> 02:37:46.753
<i>He</i> mentioned that he had the emblem,

3550
02:37:46.753 --> 02:37:49.163
that he wanted to meet at the Overcrow,

3551
02:37:49.163 --> 02:37:52.207
mentions a female's paranoia,
I'm assuming it was

3552
02:37:52.207 --> 02:37:54.898
that old woman at the--

3553
02:37:56.649 --> 02:37:58.681
actually, I don't know, maybe?

3554
02:37:58.681 --> 02:38:01.367
Maybe, I actually don't know.

3555
02:38:01.367 --> 02:38:05.887
And he was reading a book
entitled The King that Crawls.

3556
02:38:05.887 --> 02:38:10.459
Oh, and then he signed off
with "angel's eye."

3557
02:38:10.459 --> 02:38:13.459
TRAVIS: Ooh, that could help.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

3558
02:38:15.169 --> 02:38:17.377
MATT: At which point, you see

3559
02:38:18.685 --> 02:38:20.176
Essek is in the process

3560
02:38:20.176 --> 02:38:22.441
of drawing a quick glyph in the air,

3561
02:38:22.441 --> 02:38:25.382
and you recognize as a Sending spell.

3562
02:38:25.382 --> 02:38:28.741
He says-- and do any of
you speak Undercommon?

3563
02:38:28.741 --> 02:38:30.846
LAURA: Oh.

3564
02:38:30.846 --> 02:38:33.607
MARISHA: Yes, I learned it as my most recent--

3565
02:38:33.607 --> 02:38:35.976
MATT: There you go.

3566
02:38:35.976 --> 02:38:37.931
Speaks through the Sending spell,

3567
02:38:37.931 --> 02:38:42.340
basically saying, "Please move the prisoner

3568
02:38:42.340 --> 02:38:46.178
"to one of the binary paired cells."

3569
02:38:46.178 --> 02:38:47.419
MARISHA: That's what Essek says?

3570
02:38:47.419 --> 02:38:50.266
MATT: Yeah. "The interrogation is to continue."

3571
02:38:51.632 --> 02:38:53.236
MARISHA: One of the primary prepared cells?

3572
02:38:53.236 --> 02:38:54.069
LAURA: Binary.

3573
02:38:54.069 --> 02:38:55.881
MARISHA: Binary paired cells.

3574
02:38:55.881 --> 02:38:57.927
Oh, oh, oh, got it, got it, got it.

3575
02:38:57.927 --> 02:39:01.277
TRAVIS: Is it the temple of the
Dawnfather that the shackle was under?

3576
02:39:01.277 --> 02:39:02.894
LIAM: They call it the Chantry--

3577
02:39:02.894 --> 02:39:04.504
what was it, the Chantry?

3578
02:39:04.504 --> 02:39:05.713
MATT: The Chantry of the Dawn.

3579
02:39:05.713 --> 02:39:06.955
LIAM: The Chantry of the Dawnfather.

3580
02:39:06.955 --> 02:39:08.880
MATT: Of the Dawn.
TRAVIS: What was the bishop's name?

3581
02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:11.771
The guy, the fucking dude
that was up at the altar?

3582
02:39:11.771 --> 02:39:14.143
MARISHA: That was doing the stuff with the--

3583
02:39:14.143 --> 02:39:15.584
MATT: Cardinal Respa.

3584
02:39:15.584 --> 02:39:16.584
TRAVIS: Cardinal Respa?

3585
02:39:16.584 --> 02:39:17.748
MATT: Yeah, and it was a she.

3586
02:39:17.748 --> 02:39:19.820
MARISHA: I'm assuming that's who
he might've been referring to.

3587
02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:21.987
MATT: He might've been.
MARISHA: Okay.

3588
02:39:27.377 --> 02:39:31.523
SAM: Also got Obann you can
throw into the conversation.

3589
02:39:31.523 --> 02:39:35.009
LAURA: You could talk about the Laughing Hand,

3590
02:39:35.009 --> 02:39:37.819
you could talk about the Orphan Maker.

3591
02:39:38.802 --> 02:39:43.382
SAM: Yeah, and what-- did
they call Tharizdun anything?

3592
02:39:43.382 --> 02:39:46.128
No, they didn't know who they were following.
LAURA: They didn't know it was Tharizdun.

3593
02:39:46.128 --> 02:39:48.347
I don't think anybody--
MARISHA: Angel of Irons.

3594
02:39:48.347 --> 02:39:50.347
LAURA: It was just the angel.

3595
02:39:51.307 --> 02:39:53.622
MATT: "So, are you ready?"

3596
02:39:53.622 --> 02:39:54.804
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3597
02:39:54.804 --> 02:39:57.523
SAM: Do you want anyone to go
with you invisible or anything?

3598
02:39:57.523 --> 02:39:59.523
MATT: "I would not recommend that, there are wards

3599
02:39:59.523 --> 02:40:02.868
"against invisibility within
the Dungeon of Penance.

3600
02:40:02.868 --> 02:40:04.211
"You would be revealed upon entry

3601
02:40:04.211 --> 02:40:05.711
"and it would not aid
you in that instance."

3602
02:40:05.711 --> 02:40:06.651
SAM: Understood.

3603
02:40:06.651 --> 02:40:10.276
LAURA: Will it show that
he's disguising himself?

3604
02:40:10.276 --> 02:40:11.481
MATT: "It shouldn't.

3605
02:40:11.481 --> 02:40:14.150
"I can provide a buffer as we pass through."

3606
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:17.091
LIAM: We should travel with him
to the prison's entrance.

3607
02:40:17.091 --> 02:40:18.655
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3608
02:40:18.655 --> 02:40:22.535
Up until where he won't see us,
and then he'll go on alone.

3609
02:40:22.535 --> 02:40:23.483
MATT: "Very well.

3610
02:40:23.483 --> 02:40:26.033
"So you are coming with to
the exterior of the dungeon."

3611
02:40:26.033 --> 02:40:27.103
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: Yeah.

3612
02:40:27.103 --> 02:40:28.184
SAM: This is exciting.

3613
02:40:28.184 --> 02:40:29.529
LAURA: How long-- once you get to the dungeon,

3614
02:40:29.529 --> 02:40:31.584
how long to get into the cell?

3615
02:40:32.559 --> 02:40:33.533
MATT: "Five minutes."

3616
02:40:33.533 --> 02:40:35.933
LAURA: Okay, okay, good.

3617
02:40:35.933 --> 02:40:38.608
MATT: "Then come quickly, let's do this now."

3618
02:40:39.651 --> 02:40:42.625
You are led back through the Gallimaufry,

3619
02:40:42.625 --> 02:40:47.612
to the tunnels and staircases that go below

3620
02:40:47.612 --> 02:40:52.612
into the fields of subterranean farmland

3621
02:40:52.981 --> 02:40:55.519
that provide much of the food and growth

3622
02:40:55.519 --> 02:40:57.437
that feeds the people of Rosohna,

3623
02:40:57.437 --> 02:40:59.414
until eventually you come
to the familiar exterior

3624
02:40:59.414 --> 02:41:01.962
of the Dungeon of Penance,
where you had previously

3625
02:41:01.962 --> 02:41:04.588
found Yeza, as well as interrogated

3626
02:41:04.588 --> 02:41:07.604
a captured member of the...

3627
02:41:10.146 --> 02:41:11.779
my brain is not working,

3628
02:41:11.779 --> 02:41:12.756
the Vollstrecker.

3629
02:41:14.332 --> 02:41:17.640
As you reach the exterior,
Essek turns to the rest of you

3630
02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:19.928
and raises a hand, and looks to you,

3631
02:41:19.928 --> 02:41:22.892
and is currently like, reaches over

3632
02:41:22.892 --> 02:41:27.392
and grabs just the back
of your shoulders a bit,

3633
02:41:28.255 --> 02:41:29.172
looks down.

3634
02:41:30.741 --> 02:41:33.753
"Can you provide perhaps
any sort of visual

3635
02:41:33.753 --> 02:41:36.810
"of irons or chains?"

3636
02:41:36.810 --> 02:41:38.569
TRAVIS: Sure.

3637
02:41:38.569 --> 02:41:42.211
Yes, I'll make myself look
like Vence and then I'll use--

3638
02:41:44.493 --> 02:41:46.532
ASHLEY: You could borrow some, if you'd like.

3639
02:41:46.532 --> 02:41:47.644
TRAVIS: Yeah, we actually have some.

3640
02:41:47.644 --> 02:41:49.143
MATT: You can do that, if you want.

3641
02:41:49.143 --> 02:41:51.279
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take out
some of the manacles.

3642
02:41:51.279 --> 02:41:53.781
We have two, three pairs?

3643
02:41:53.781 --> 02:41:54.911
MATT: Okay.

3644
02:41:54.911 --> 02:41:57.004
So put on the manacles, you wanted
to cast a spell, you said?

3645
02:41:57.004 --> 02:41:58.933
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to
go up and put my hands

3646
02:41:58.933 --> 02:42:02.876
on either side of Fjord's
face and cast Enhance Ability.

3647
02:42:03.951 --> 02:42:05.368
Eagle's Splendor.

3648
02:42:07.045 --> 02:42:10.660
Yeah, so you get advantage
on any kind of charisma, I mean--

3649
02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:12.756
you'll be a smooth
talker. You already are.

3650
02:42:12.756 --> 02:42:15.273
But you'll be an even
smoother talker, okay?

3651
02:42:15.273 --> 02:42:16.106
TRAVIS: Sure.

3652
02:42:16.106 --> 02:42:18.527
LAURA: You should be able to trick him better.

3653
02:42:18.527 --> 02:42:19.490
TRAVIS: Should.

3654
02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:21.398
LAURA: You can do this, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3655
02:42:21.398 --> 02:42:24.932
SAM: And some injury to your throat, maybe,

3656
02:42:24.932 --> 02:42:26.207
so that your voice--

3657
02:42:26.207 --> 02:42:27.610
LAURA: Yeah, make it look
like you were, like, cut

3658
02:42:27.610 --> 02:42:29.389
or punched, like, bruised or something,

3659
02:42:29.389 --> 02:42:31.627
like you were strangled,
so it makes sense that--

3660
02:42:31.627 --> 02:42:32.668
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay, yeah.

3661
02:42:32.668 --> 02:42:33.876
LAURA: You don't sound exactly like yourself.

3662
02:42:33.876 --> 02:42:36.058
TRAVIS: I'll think about giving
myself like a rope burn,

3663
02:42:36.058 --> 02:42:37.809
like a terrible terrible rope burn

3664
02:42:37.809 --> 02:42:41.885
that started to scab up
a little bit across my throat.

3665
02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:43.871
At an angle.

3666
02:42:43.871 --> 02:42:44.805
MATT: Okay.

3667
02:42:44.805 --> 02:42:46.492
LIAM: Fjord, come.

3668
02:42:46.492 --> 02:42:48.580
I hold the pearl up to his forehead

3669
02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:51.578
and you see some geometric
halos of white for a moment,

3670
02:42:51.578 --> 02:42:53.623
and I've cast Fortune's Favor.

3671
02:42:53.623 --> 02:42:56.117
So you have a luck roll, essentially.

3672
02:42:56.117 --> 02:42:57.215
TRAVIS: Ooh.

3673
02:42:57.215 --> 02:42:58.538
So any shit roll I can reroll?

3674
02:42:58.538 --> 02:43:00.130
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3675
02:43:00.130 --> 02:43:02.505
SAM: And Fjord, if you do well in there...

3676
02:43:04.430 --> 02:43:05.905
I'll give you a button.

3677
02:43:05.905 --> 02:43:07.895
(laughter)

3678
02:43:07.895 --> 02:43:08.760
TRAVIS: A button?

3679
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:11.969
SAM: A button, but it's not just any button.

3680
02:43:11.969 --> 02:43:14.703
It was discovered on Buttonbeard's ship.

3681
02:43:14.703 --> 02:43:16.528
(Laura gasps)

3682
02:43:19.038 --> 02:43:21.999
TRAVIS: That's all the inspiration I need.

3683
02:43:21.999 --> 02:43:24.671
(laughter)

3684
02:43:24.671 --> 02:43:27.603
Truly a grand gesture, Nott.

3685
02:43:27.603 --> 02:43:28.436
Thank you.

3686
02:43:30.433 --> 02:43:32.217
(Matt chuckles)

3687
02:43:34.341 --> 02:43:35.174
TRAVIS: I'm ready.

3688
02:43:35.174 --> 02:43:37.384
LAURA: Why didn't you ever offer me a button?
MATT: "Very well."

3689
02:43:37.384 --> 02:43:39.689
SAM: There's no such thing as Buttonbeard.

3690
02:43:39.689 --> 02:43:41.514
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: No.

3691
02:43:43.328 --> 02:43:45.628
MATT: Essek grabs the front of the chains.

3692
02:43:45.628 --> 02:43:46.726
As part of the shackles there is

3693
02:43:46.726 --> 02:43:49.287
a lead to the front,
and pulls you in alongside,

3694
02:43:49.287 --> 02:43:52.020
and you guys watch as Essek takes Fjord,

3695
02:43:52.020 --> 02:43:55.609
in illusory form, into
the Dungeon of Penance proper.

3696
02:43:55.609 --> 02:43:56.679
LAURA: You can do it!

3697
02:43:56.679 --> 02:43:58.500
ASHLEY: Be careful, Fjord.

3698
02:43:59.591 --> 02:44:01.167
MATT: Immediately as you step into it,

3699
02:44:01.167 --> 02:44:02.867
that disorienting affect hits you,

3700
02:44:02.867 --> 02:44:05.104
and as you step deeper and
deeper into it, you know,

3701
02:44:05.104 --> 02:44:07.337
it's either, like, gravity
pulls at different spaces

3702
02:44:07.337 --> 02:44:09.245
or there's something about
it that just makes you

3703
02:44:09.245 --> 02:44:14.113
a little dizzy, your eyes
have a hard time focusing,

3704
02:44:14.113 --> 02:44:17.434
and you recall, as the
times you've been here,

3705
02:44:17.434 --> 02:44:19.709
there's some sort of enchantment within here

3706
02:44:19.709 --> 02:44:23.675
that's designed to ensure that you

3707
02:44:23.675 --> 02:44:26.781
and possibly other people
who step through these halls

3708
02:44:26.781 --> 02:44:29.536
have a hard time really
remembering where they're walking

3709
02:44:29.536 --> 02:44:32.745
or keeping tabs on the
layout of the interior.

3710
02:44:32.745 --> 02:44:35.946
TRAVIS: As we're moving, I'll whisper to Essek,

3711
02:44:35.946 --> 02:44:37.696
how long will I have?

3712
02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:41.565
MATT: "Well, I don't know.

3713
02:44:41.565 --> 02:44:44.391
"It has been a very thorough investigation,

3714
02:44:44.391 --> 02:44:48.548
"and whatever information you might get

3715
02:44:48.548 --> 02:44:52.840
"could be full of lies,
it could be they are confused.

3716
02:44:53.751 --> 02:44:54.584
"Just...

3717
02:44:55.426 --> 02:44:59.309
"don't make it too forceful
as to gather attention

3718
02:44:59.309 --> 02:45:01.042
"that would make this a curiosity.

3719
02:45:01.042 --> 02:45:04.153
"This is off the books,
as you would say."

3720
02:45:04.153 --> 02:45:06.795
TRAVIS: Black bag, like it.

3721
02:45:07.773 --> 02:45:09.570
MATT: Leads you down a few more corridors,

3722
02:45:09.570 --> 02:45:11.157
a long staircase that goes to a floor

3723
02:45:11.157 --> 02:45:14.945
that you've not been on, and eventually you come upon--

3724
02:45:14.945 --> 02:45:19.129
there are two cells that are next to each other,

3725
02:45:19.129 --> 02:45:21.992
separated by a wall, and in the center of the wall

3726
02:45:21.992 --> 02:45:25.780
there is a small window of bars,

3727
02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:29.696
intentionally placed for prisoners

3728
02:45:29.696 --> 02:45:33.034
that have some means of interfacing.

3729
02:45:33.034 --> 02:45:36.554
And you are thrown into the chamber,

3730
02:45:36.554 --> 02:45:40.933
and Essek floats into the shadows.

3731
02:45:40.933 --> 02:45:43.100
One of the guards at their post stands there

3732
02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:45.650
and waits, but off to the side.

3733
02:45:45.650 --> 02:45:47.558
As you're tossed in, you get a quick glance

3734
02:45:47.558 --> 02:45:49.399
in the corner, and you can see there's a figure curled up

3735
02:45:49.399 --> 02:45:52.957
across the stone bed platform

3736
02:45:52.957 --> 02:45:54.497
I guess you would call it. It's not made for comfort

3737
02:45:54.497 --> 02:45:57.679
by any means, but in tattered, ragged,

3738
02:45:57.679 --> 02:46:01.768
Rosohna-style clothing, very affluent at one point probably,

3739
02:46:01.768 --> 02:46:06.126
but now torn and dirtied, you see a drow male

3740
02:46:06.126 --> 02:46:08.335
curled up on the edge, and as you impact and land,

3741
02:46:08.335 --> 02:46:11.172
the figure stirs slightly.

3742
02:46:12.164 --> 02:46:13.957
And then you're inside the chamber now.

3743
02:46:13.957 --> 02:46:16.826
TRAVIS: And is this square between the walls

3744
02:46:16.826 --> 02:46:18.140
small or is it large?

3745
02:46:18.140 --> 02:46:20.630
MATT: It's small, it's about, like, that big.

3746
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:23.763
TRAVIS: I'll stand up and head towards the doors

3747
02:46:23.763 --> 02:46:25.986
and shout out after the one that threw me in,

3748
02:46:25.986 --> 02:46:28.016
in a better Zemnian accent than I can do:

3749
02:46:28.016 --> 02:46:30.183
You can't keep me in here!

3750
02:46:31.257 --> 02:46:32.415
No response.

3751
02:46:33.274 --> 02:46:35.704
I'll go and I'll walk by the square.

3752
02:46:35.704 --> 02:46:38.330
Is he looking or going back to sleep?

3753
02:46:38.330 --> 02:46:39.506
Are his eyes open?

3754
02:46:39.506 --> 02:46:41.532
MATT: The figure is glancing up

3755
02:46:41.532 --> 02:46:43.541
and looking in your direction,

3756
02:46:43.541 --> 02:46:45.016
but hasn't got up yet.

3757
02:46:47.558 --> 02:46:50.949
TRAVIS: I'll clear my throat. (coughs)

3758
02:46:55.212 --> 02:46:56.962
MATT: A few moments pass.

3759
02:46:58.737 --> 02:47:00.478
TRAVIS: Eye contact at all?

3760
02:47:00.478 --> 02:47:03.397
MATT: You're looking up through it now?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

3761
02:47:03.397 --> 02:47:06.128
MATT: About a minute later, the head shifts again,

3762
02:47:06.128 --> 02:47:08.005
and from what little bit of light there is

3763
02:47:08.005 --> 02:47:10.681
from the dull torch sconce across the way,

3764
02:47:10.681 --> 02:47:12.560
you can see a little bit of a flash

3765
02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:15.396
of wet eyeballs that look in your direction.

3766
02:47:15.396 --> 02:47:18.666
TRAVIS: I'll look away and move away from the square.

3767
02:47:20.074 --> 02:47:23.074
MATT: You very faintly hear the shuffling.

3768
02:47:26.845 --> 02:47:28.928
TRAVIS: I'll wait for a minute.

3769
02:47:30.073 --> 02:47:32.552
Does it sound like he's moving any closer?

3770
02:47:32.552 --> 02:47:34.552
MATT: You've heard movement.

3771
02:47:35.515 --> 02:47:37.765
TRAVIS: I'll wait another minute.

3772
02:47:39.286 --> 02:47:42.811
I'll get up and walk to the doors, look around,

3773
02:47:42.811 --> 02:47:45.446
shuffle back towards the square,

3774
02:47:45.446 --> 02:47:49.188
and just do one eye to look through.

3775
02:47:49.188 --> 02:47:50.106
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3776
02:47:50.106 --> 02:47:51.259
TRAVIS: What do I see?

3777
02:47:51.259 --> 02:47:54.223
MATT: You see a male drow face.

3778
02:47:54.223 --> 02:47:56.890
(laughter)

3779
02:48:00.003 --> 02:48:03.420
Bloodied, one eye is swollen nearly shut.

3780
02:48:05.901 --> 02:48:09.713
Hair tattered and matted, and is breathing

3781
02:48:09.713 --> 02:48:10.857
a little heavy.

3782
02:48:10.857 --> 02:48:13.736
(breathing heavily)

3783
02:48:13.736 --> 02:48:16.287
TRAVIS: He looking in my direction?
MATT: Yeah.

3784
02:48:17.617 --> 02:48:18.867
TRAVIS: Angel's eyes.

3785
02:48:22.912 --> 02:48:24.902
MATT: "Why do I know you?"

3786
02:48:24.902 --> 02:48:26.273
TRAVIS: Shh.

3787
02:48:26.273 --> 02:48:29.400
I'll move away from the window.

3788
02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:30.567
Sit back down.

3789
02:48:33.697 --> 02:48:36.736
I'll wait two minutes.

3790
02:48:36.736 --> 02:48:37.569
MATT: Okay.

3791
02:48:39.014 --> 02:48:43.304
TRAVIS: And without making myself visible to the window,

3792
02:48:43.304 --> 02:48:47.654
I'll say, what do they know?

3793
02:48:53.547 --> 02:48:55.897
MATT: "They've pulled me from my station,

3794
02:48:57.588 --> 02:49:02.572
"and accused me of things, but I did them,

3795
02:49:04.325 --> 02:49:06.075
"but I don't know how.

3796
02:49:08.192 --> 02:49:10.942
"I know you, but I don't know how.

3797
02:49:12.036 --> 02:49:14.369
"I feel like I'm going crazy."

3798
02:49:18.479 --> 02:49:21.229
TRAVIS: Our time here will be rewarded.

3799
02:49:23.198 --> 02:49:24.115
Stand fast.

3800
02:49:25.226 --> 02:49:26.963
(Adeen coughing)

3801
02:49:26.963 --> 02:49:29.672
MATT: "What are you talking about?"

3802
02:49:32.332 --> 02:49:34.749
TRAVIS: We succeeded in Rexxentrum.

3803
02:49:36.527 --> 02:49:40.860
The Angel of Irons is one step closer to being free.

3804
02:49:43.070 --> 02:49:45.237
MATT: "I don't know this angel.

3805
02:49:46.592 --> 02:49:48.817
"No, I do, how?

3806
02:49:50.031 --> 02:49:51.571
"Who are you?

3807
02:49:51.571 --> 02:49:54.629
"You're Vence. Why do I know this?"

3808
02:49:54.629 --> 02:49:55.976
TRAVIS: Shh.

3809
02:49:55.976 --> 02:49:58.643
(Adeen coughing)

3810
02:50:01.816 --> 02:50:05.753
TRAVIS: Cardinal Respa sends his regards, her regards.

3811
02:50:05.753 --> 02:50:10.353
(laughter)

3812
02:50:14.502 --> 02:50:17.314
MATT: The head comes back up and looks at you,

3813
02:50:17.314 --> 02:50:22.314
and the eyes are wide, the one that isn't partially swollen,

3814
02:50:22.991 --> 02:50:27.392
and tense, and there's sweat currently mingling

3815
02:50:27.392 --> 02:50:29.698
with the blood that was partially dried

3816
02:50:29.698 --> 02:50:32.688
and caked on that side, the forehead that you can see.

3817
02:50:34.354 --> 02:50:38.246
"I don't know what you're talking about."

3818
02:50:39.694 --> 02:50:41.518
TRAVIS: Very good.

3819
02:50:41.518 --> 02:50:42.823
Very good.

3820
02:50:42.823 --> 02:50:44.455
(Marisha laughing)

3821
02:50:44.455 --> 02:50:47.122
TRAVIS: Were your deliveries successful?

3822
02:50:50.147 --> 02:50:53.147
MATT: "I don't know why I did what I did.

3823
02:50:55.539 --> 02:50:57.566
"It doesn't make any sense."

3824
02:50:57.566 --> 02:50:59.358
He pulls away from the hole,

3825
02:50:59.358 --> 02:51:01.256
and you hear the body scrape and slide

3826
02:51:01.256 --> 02:51:03.640
against this other side of the stone wall.

3827
02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:05.081
(Adeen softly sobs)

3828
02:51:05.986 --> 02:51:07.653
And you hear crying.

3829
02:51:09.219 --> 02:51:12.834
LAURA: (whisper) He traded for the beacons.

3830
02:51:12.834 --> 02:51:14.804
Find out what he traded for the beacons.

3831
02:51:14.804 --> 02:51:17.463
(pigeon cooing)
TRAVIS: Traded?

3832
02:51:17.463 --> 02:51:20.631
LAURA: He traded the beacons for something.

3833
02:51:20.631 --> 02:51:23.322
(pigeon cooing)

3834
02:51:23.322 --> 02:51:25.759
That's what we've got to find out. (coos)

3835
02:51:25.759 --> 02:51:27.645
TRAVIS: I don't remember that part.

3836
02:51:27.645 --> 02:51:29.726
(Travis sighs heavily)

3837
02:51:29.726 --> 02:51:31.465
LAURA: That's what we're trying to find out.

3838
02:51:31.465 --> 02:51:33.962
(pigeon cooing

3839
02:51:33.962 --> 02:51:35.360
TRAVIS: Is it?
LAURA: Yeah.

3840
02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:38.027
(laughter)

3841
02:51:43.394 --> 02:51:45.011
LIAM: It's fine, we talk this shit out at home.

3842
02:51:45.011 --> 02:51:47.017
We can talk it out. Talk it out.

3843
02:51:47.017 --> 02:51:49.268
TRAVIS: What did you, really?
LAURA: Yeah!

3844
02:51:49.268 --> 02:51:51.556
(laughter)

3845
02:51:51.556 --> 02:51:54.095
LIAM: It's a D&amp;D game, talk it out.

3846
02:51:54.095 --> 02:51:56.771
TRAVIS: (stilted) What were you given
in exchange for the beacons?

3847
02:51:56.771 --> 02:52:01.671
(laughter)

3848
02:52:03.324 --> 02:52:06.382
MATT: There's a long silence,

3849
02:52:07.565 --> 02:52:09.629
and the sobbing continues a bit,

3850
02:52:09.629 --> 02:52:12.251
and then through the sobbing, you hear,

3851
02:52:13.376 --> 02:52:17.543
"It doesn't-- I would never, I would never give away

3852
02:52:18.977 --> 02:52:23.268
"the heart of our city.

3853
02:52:23.268 --> 02:52:28.105
"But I did, for money, why?

3854
02:52:28.105 --> 02:52:32.738
"Nothing makes sense. Nothing makes sense."

3855
02:52:36.982 --> 02:52:39.952
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to do this.

3856
02:52:39.952 --> 02:52:42.177
(Travis sighs)

3857
02:52:42.177 --> 02:52:45.698
MATT: "Nothing. Makes. Sense."

3858
02:52:45.698 --> 02:52:49.962
TRAVIS: And he's smashing his face. Stop, hold, hold.

3859
02:52:49.962 --> 02:52:54.364
MATT: At which point, (exhales),

3860
02:52:54.364 --> 02:52:58.753
exhales, and you hear nothing for a moment.

3861
02:52:58.753 --> 02:53:01.684
And then (snoring).

3862
02:53:01.684 --> 02:53:04.893
TRAVIS: He's fucking knocked himself out.

3863
02:53:06.143 --> 02:53:07.528
Hey, hey.

3864
02:53:07.528 --> 02:53:10.997
(laughter)

3865
02:53:10.997 --> 02:53:12.247
Hey, Taskhand.

3866
02:53:13.083 --> 02:53:14.359
You with us?

3867
02:53:14.359 --> 02:53:15.192
Hey.

3868
02:53:16.948 --> 02:53:17.781
Hello?

3869
02:53:19.239 --> 02:53:20.504
Ey!

3870
02:53:20.504 --> 02:53:21.780
(Marisha laughing)

3871
02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:23.313
Shit.

3872
02:53:23.313 --> 02:53:24.919
TALIESIN: That accent.

3873
02:53:24.919 --> 02:53:26.262
(Laura laughing)

3874
02:53:26.262 --> 02:53:27.976
TRAVIS: I'll, like, walk over to the bars and be like:

3875
02:53:27.976 --> 02:53:30.193
Hey, guard, come here.

3876
02:53:30.193 --> 02:53:31.026
Come here!

3877
02:53:32.487 --> 02:53:33.844
MATT: The guard looks over.

3878
02:53:33.844 --> 02:53:35.603
TRAVIS: I can't, I can't see him.

3879
02:53:35.603 --> 02:53:37.341
Is he passed out?

3880
02:53:37.341 --> 02:53:39.564
(laughter)

3881
02:53:39.564 --> 02:53:41.239
MATT: The guard just stays at the station.

3882
02:53:41.239 --> 02:53:45.382
Essek is still in the shadows about 15 feet back,

3883
02:53:45.382 --> 02:53:47.000
kind of against the wall, and turns

3884
02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.475
and looks in your direction.

3885
02:53:49.475 --> 02:53:52.374
TRAVIS: I just, I'm worried about prisoner welfare,

3886
02:53:52.374 --> 02:53:54.129
it sounded like he was hurting himself.

3887
02:53:54.129 --> 02:53:57.063
I'm just making sure he's alive.

3888
02:53:57.063 --> 02:54:01.110
TRAVIS: Essek slowly drifts to the edge and looks over.

3889
02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:02.577
"He's asleep."

3890
02:54:02.577 --> 02:54:04.311
TRAVIS: Ah. That's good.

3891
02:54:04.311 --> 02:54:07.223
Thank you for quieting my concerns.

3892
02:54:11.740 --> 02:54:14.713
You know, I think I would like to confess--

3893
02:54:14.713 --> 02:54:16.483
(laughter)

3894
02:54:16.483 --> 02:54:19.242
--some of my crimes. Perhaps I can do that

3895
02:54:19.242 --> 02:54:22.313
to someone of a high station, I'm ready to leave.

3896
02:54:23.355 --> 02:54:24.287
MATT: "Very well."

3897
02:54:24.287 --> 02:54:26.870
(Sam laughing)

3898
02:54:27.784 --> 02:54:29.885
MATT: Opens the door with the guard's help,

3899
02:54:29.885 --> 02:54:32.738
takes the chain and leads you out, closes behind.

3900
02:54:32.738 --> 02:54:34.462
TRAVIS: Oh, you bastard!

3901
02:54:34.462 --> 02:54:36.079
You're so strong!

3902
02:54:36.079 --> 02:54:37.478
MATT: "Shh.

3903
02:54:37.478 --> 02:54:40.130
"You're overselling it."
TRAVIS: You'll never take me alive!

3904
02:54:40.130 --> 02:54:41.872
MATT: "You're overselling it."
TRAVIS: You floating fuck.

3905
02:54:41.872 --> 02:54:44.122
(laughter)

3906
02:54:46.843 --> 02:54:48.148
MATT: "What was that?"

3907
02:54:48.148 --> 02:54:50.815
TRAVIS: No, I take it back, I'm sorry.

3908
02:54:52.350 --> 02:54:54.017
MATT: "Don't oversell it."

3909
02:54:54.927 --> 02:54:56.113
(Marisha laughing)

3910
02:54:56.113 --> 02:55:00.708
And drags you along slowly through the interior

3911
02:55:00.708 --> 02:55:04.137
of the Dungeon of Penance once more.

3912
02:55:04.137 --> 02:55:06.612
TRAVIS: It's so weird in here.

3913
02:55:06.612 --> 02:55:09.689
MATT: "By design, friend, by design."

3914
02:55:09.689 --> 02:55:13.389
Pulls you outside. You guys watch as Essek emerges,

3915
02:55:13.389 --> 02:55:17.260
holding the chain, pulling behind the rugged-looking Vence.

3916
02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:18.491
LAURA: We all cheer.

3917
02:55:18.491 --> 02:55:21.058
Yeah, he's back, you did it!

3918
02:55:21.058 --> 02:55:22.841
What'd you find out, all the stuff?!

3919
02:55:22.841 --> 02:55:25.458
TRAVIS: I totally didn't forget to ask what he traded

3920
02:55:25.458 --> 02:55:27.806
for the beacon delivery, thank god.

3921
02:55:27.806 --> 02:55:28.697
TALIESIN: That's good, that would've been

3922
02:55:28.697 --> 02:55:29.854
an important question to ask.

3923
02:55:29.854 --> 02:55:32.354
MATT: (as Essek) "He seemed to be quite disoriented, and--"

3924
02:55:32.354 --> 02:55:33.809
SAM: Fjord or the other guy?

3925
02:55:33.809 --> 02:55:34.642
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3926
02:55:34.642 --> 02:55:35.475
MATT: "The other guy.

3927
02:55:35.475 --> 02:55:37.143
"I was worried about that."

3928
02:55:37.143 --> 02:55:40.977
TRAVIS: I don't think he chose to do what he did.

3929
02:55:40.977 --> 02:55:43.369
It sounds like he was under some sort of control,

3930
02:55:43.369 --> 02:55:44.647
mind control.

3931
02:55:44.647 --> 02:55:45.948
Is that a real thing?

3932
02:55:45.948 --> 02:55:46.866
LAURA: Yasha!

3933
02:55:46.866 --> 02:55:49.058
SAM: Yasha was mind controlled, we think.

3934
02:55:50.366 --> 02:55:51.983
ASHLEY: (exasperated) Yes, Nott!

3935
02:55:52.909 --> 02:55:56.068
TRAVIS: But you knew that it was not you

3936
02:55:56.068 --> 02:55:58.032
doing those things, right?

3937
02:55:58.032 --> 02:56:00.800
Or was it confusing at times?

3938
02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:02.955
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was very confusing at times,

3939
02:56:02.955 --> 02:56:06.338
but I mean, I knew that I was--

3940
02:56:06.338 --> 02:56:08.704
I-I was a puppet.

3941
02:56:09.678 --> 02:56:13.563
I mean, I didn't have control over the things

3942
02:56:13.563 --> 02:56:16.208
that I was doing, but I knew I was doing them.

3943
02:56:16.208 --> 02:56:19.218
MATT: "It could very well be a similar type effect."

3944
02:56:19.218 --> 02:56:21.991
MARISHA: I wonder if Vence was also a puppet.

3945
02:56:21.991 --> 02:56:24.177
LIAM: But you knew the source.

3946
02:56:24.177 --> 02:56:25.539
Yeah?

3947
02:56:25.539 --> 02:56:27.011
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3948
02:56:27.011 --> 02:56:29.104
TALIESIN: Imagine if you didn't know the source.

3949
02:56:29.104 --> 02:56:32.509
TRAVIS: He acted as if he didn't
know why he did these things,

3950
02:56:32.509 --> 02:56:34.866
or why he seemed to have taken money for the delivery

3951
02:56:34.866 --> 02:56:37.849
of the beacons. He didn't know why he did that,

3952
02:56:37.849 --> 02:56:41.477
and then he smashed his face against a wall several times.

3953
02:56:41.477 --> 02:56:43.094
He's dead now.

3954
02:56:43.094 --> 02:56:43.997
ASHLEY: What!?

3955
02:56:43.997 --> 02:56:45.903
TRAVIS: Yeah, just a horrible tragedy.

3956
02:56:45.903 --> 02:56:46.792
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

3957
02:56:46.792 --> 02:56:49.129
TRAVIS: No, he's alive.

3958
02:56:49.129 --> 02:56:53.331
He seemed genuinely confused. He seemed to recognize

3959
02:56:53.331 --> 02:56:57.590
Vence's face, and also the greeting, angel's eyes.

3960
02:56:58.873 --> 02:57:00.040
LAURA: Angel's eye?

3961
02:57:00.981 --> 02:57:02.013
TRAVIS: Yep.

3962
02:57:02.013 --> 02:57:03.662
(laughter)

3963
02:57:03.662 --> 02:57:06.485
I might have made it plural in the room,

3964
02:57:06.485 --> 02:57:08.490
which might have been what the look was for.

3965
02:57:08.490 --> 02:57:09.653
Why add an S?

3966
02:57:09.653 --> 02:57:11.314
I don't know.

3967
02:57:11.314 --> 02:57:13.018
(laughter)

3968
02:57:13.018 --> 02:57:15.676
ASHLEY: It was, you know, your
first time playing that character.

3969
02:57:15.676 --> 02:57:18.457
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, honestly, I
did get a rehearsal or anything.

3970
02:57:18.457 --> 02:57:19.882
(Sam laughing)

3971
02:57:19.882 --> 02:57:22.339
Just actor's nightmare, straight out on, yep.

3972
02:57:22.339 --> 02:57:23.357
(Laura laughing)

3973
02:57:23.357 --> 02:57:24.905
LIAM: You have to make strong choices.

3974
02:57:24.905 --> 02:57:26.155
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

3975
02:57:27.945 --> 02:57:31.241
TALIESIN: Imagine if you were told
not to think about what you did.

3976
02:57:32.099 --> 02:57:34.932
TRAVIS: I mean, is memory modification a thing that happens?

3977
02:57:34.932 --> 02:57:36.748
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: It is?

3978
02:57:36.748 --> 02:57:38.129
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, I can do it.

3979
02:57:38.129 --> 02:57:39.639
TALIESIN: I can-- well.

3980
02:57:39.639 --> 02:57:40.623
LAURA: Can you?
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

3981
02:57:40.623 --> 02:57:42.120
TALIESIN: I can do stuff like that.

3982
02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:44.679
LAURA: Like, I could make you think that something

3983
02:57:44.679 --> 02:57:47.536
different happened than happened.

3984
02:57:48.453 --> 02:57:51.954
MARISHA: Sounds very similar to what Yasha went through.

3985
02:57:51.954 --> 02:57:54.694
TRAVIS: All the time, or just once?

3986
02:57:54.694 --> 02:57:56.778
MATT: "That is a very dangerous magic for someone

3987
02:57:56.778 --> 02:57:57.820
"to be playing with."

3988
02:57:57.820 --> 02:57:59.020
LAURA: I haven't ever played with it.

3989
02:57:59.020 --> 02:58:01.497
I know that it's, you know, important.

3990
02:58:01.497 --> 02:58:04.348
TRAVIS: Speaking of which, your abilities are very strange

3991
02:58:04.348 --> 02:58:06.348
compared to the Empire, I mean,

3992
02:58:06.348 --> 02:58:09.183
just being in here is sort of nauseating.

3993
02:58:09.183 --> 02:58:11.249
Does the beacon or your practices allow anyone

3994
02:58:11.249 --> 02:58:14.632
to control the mind of someone else in that way?

3995
02:58:14.632 --> 02:58:16.685
MATT: "Dunamancy does not work in that way.

3996
02:58:16.685 --> 02:58:20.195
"There are many sorts of magic and arcane spells

3997
02:58:20.195 --> 02:58:24.132
"that can alter one's experience of memory,

3998
02:58:24.132 --> 02:58:26.788
"from what I've heard, but that does not fall within

3999
02:58:26.788 --> 02:58:28.862
"the purview of dunamancy, by any means."

4000
02:58:28.862 --> 02:58:31.057
TRAVIS: I mean, it's no short spell.
He would've had to have been

4001
02:58:31.057 --> 02:58:32.979
under control for a while.

4002
02:58:32.979 --> 02:58:35.869
Gain access to the beacons, make these exchanges,

4003
02:58:35.869 --> 02:58:37.233
deliver them.
TALIESIN: To be fair--

4004
02:58:37.233 --> 02:58:38.353
MATT: "This is true."

4005
02:58:38.353 --> 02:58:40.188
TALIESIN: --he would've been the fourth person that we knew

4006
02:58:40.188 --> 02:58:43.099
that was under a constant long-standing control

4007
02:58:43.099 --> 02:58:43.936
within this cult.

4008
02:58:43.936 --> 02:58:46.427
TRAVIS: Yasha, the Taskhand.

4009
02:58:46.427 --> 02:58:48.005
TALIESIN: The Laughing Hand.

4010
02:58:48.005 --> 02:58:50.653
TRAVIS: The Laughing Hand, and Unbreakable, or the--

4011
02:58:50.653 --> 02:58:52.594
SAM: Inevitable End.
TRAVIS: Inevitable End.

4012
02:58:52.594 --> 02:58:53.761
TRAVIS: Unbreakable.

4013
02:58:55.411 --> 02:58:57.203
LIAM: Bruce Willis.

4014
02:58:57.203 --> 02:59:00.654
MARISHA: Who knows with people like Vence or Cardinal Respa,

4015
02:59:00.654 --> 02:59:02.281
or maybe anyone.

4016
02:59:02.281 --> 02:59:05.195
LAURA: Oh my god, what if they were all under a spell?

4017
02:59:05.195 --> 02:59:08.486
MARISHA: We've already learned from what we've researched

4018
02:59:08.486 --> 02:59:12.074
with the Chained Oblivion that he was guised

4019
02:59:12.074 --> 02:59:14.654
under this cult of the Angel of Irons.

4020
02:59:14.654 --> 02:59:17.289
It seems more righteous than what it is.

4021
02:59:17.289 --> 02:59:20.702
It's all manipulative to get him to rise

4022
02:59:20.702 --> 02:59:25.468
under some other form of a deity that's false,

4023
02:59:25.468 --> 02:59:26.992
so his entire--

4024
02:59:26.992 --> 02:59:29.317
LIAM: To bring about absolute destruction of everything,

4025
02:59:29.317 --> 02:59:31.169
so I would imagine yeah.
MATT: "It is solid logic."

4026
02:59:31.169 --> 02:59:32.757
TRAVIS: Do you have a mark on the back of your neck?

4027
02:59:32.757 --> 02:59:34.597
Did it leave a scar or--

4028
02:59:34.597 --> 02:59:36.404
LAURA: Oh yeah, the thing?

4029
02:59:36.404 --> 02:59:37.879
Can I look, can I look and see?

4030
02:59:37.879 --> 02:59:39.627
ASHLEY: Yeah, give it a look.

4031
02:59:39.627 --> 02:59:40.655
LAURA: Is it still there?

4032
02:59:40.655 --> 02:59:42.520
MATT: There is a brief mark there that's reminiscent

4033
02:59:42.520 --> 02:59:44.760
of what was there, though it has begun to heal.

4034
02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:46.872
LAURA: Essek, Essek, Essek, come here, look at this,

4035
02:59:46.872 --> 02:59:48.341
look at this mark.

4036
02:59:48.341 --> 02:59:50.544
I show exactly what it looks like.

4037
02:59:50.544 --> 02:59:54.165
You should see, and see if that guy has the same mark,

4038
02:59:54.165 --> 02:59:56.454
and then you know that he was mind controlled, maybe.

4039
02:59:56.454 --> 02:59:58.237
MATT: "I will inspect.

4040
02:59:58.237 --> 02:59:59.404
"Give me a moment."

4041
02:59:59.404 --> 03:00:02.668
LAURA: If it was not his choice, you know,

4042
03:00:02.668 --> 03:00:05.002
I know it's hard, but maybe he shouldn't be punished

4043
03:00:05.002 --> 03:00:07.982
quite as harshly, because you know--

4044
03:00:09.265 --> 03:00:11.657
MATT: "That is not for my judgment to make."

4045
03:00:11.657 --> 03:00:16.657
ASHLEY: Well, if, I don't know, if there's an emergency,

4046
03:00:17.166 --> 03:00:22.144
I could also speak to him in a different way,

4047
03:00:22.144 --> 03:00:25.955
from someone who has had a similar experience to him.

4048
03:00:25.955 --> 03:00:27.355
SAM: Oh, yes.

4049
03:00:28.430 --> 03:00:30.696
ASHLEY: If violence is not working

4050
03:00:30.696 --> 03:00:34.830
to get the answers that you need,

4051
03:00:37.463 --> 03:00:41.083
maybe I could try relating to him.

4052
03:00:41.083 --> 03:00:44.583
MATT: "Well, we have the answers we need,

4053
03:00:45.643 --> 03:00:49.285
"but what answers are you looking for with this?"

4054
03:00:51.438 --> 03:00:55.830
ASHLEY: Maybe, I don't know, who was doing this?

4055
03:00:55.830 --> 03:00:57.158
I don't know.
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

4056
03:00:57.158 --> 03:00:59.370
Just in case it's somebody besides Obann.

4057
03:00:59.370 --> 03:01:01.968
LAURA: That's true, or if he had any more connections here.

4058
03:01:01.968 --> 03:01:06.123
MARISHA: Maybe Obann was one of several generals

4059
03:01:06.123 --> 03:01:08.358
for the Chained Oblivion, you know?
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

4060
03:01:08.358 --> 03:01:10.388
MARISHA: In, like, a pyramid scheme.

4061
03:01:10.388 --> 03:01:12.681
So if it wasn't Obann that mind controlled him,

4062
03:01:12.681 --> 03:01:13.736
then who was it?

4063
03:01:13.736 --> 03:01:16.147
TALIESIN: It was probably Obann
that mind controlled him, I think.

4064
03:01:16.147 --> 03:01:17.519
MARISHA: It was probably Obann that mind controlled him.

4065
03:01:17.519 --> 03:01:20.346
TALIESIN: I think the question really is

4066
03:01:20.346 --> 03:01:23.046
if he knows that he was mind controlled, maybe he can--

4067
03:01:23.046 --> 03:01:24.898
ASHLEY: I think that's the thing to me.

4068
03:01:24.898 --> 03:01:27.436
TALIESIN: Start saying if you talk to anybody else.

4069
03:01:27.436 --> 03:01:29.752
MARISHA: Well, let's have Essek
look at the back of his neck,

4070
03:01:29.752 --> 03:01:31.272
that'll be first thing, and then we'll get

4071
03:01:31.272 --> 03:01:32.288
more answers from that.

4072
03:01:32.288 --> 03:01:34.676
TRAVIS: Jester, you should know, he said he hated weasels.

4073
03:01:34.676 --> 03:01:36.047
(Sam laughs)

4074
03:01:36.047 --> 03:01:36.954
LAURA: Why?
TRAVIS: I don't know.

4075
03:01:36.954 --> 03:01:39.142
LAURA: Did he say when he was controlled he hated weasels,

4076
03:01:39.142 --> 03:01:41.108
or was it normally--

4077
03:01:41.108 --> 03:01:43.439
TRAVIS: Outright, they they wither and die

4078
03:01:43.439 --> 03:01:45.208
if not left out into the wild.

4079
03:01:45.208 --> 03:01:48.821
They are not pets or-- oh.

4080
03:01:48.821 --> 03:01:50.260
LAURA: Sprinkle?

4081
03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:52.136
Is that true?

4082
03:01:52.136 --> 03:01:54.851
MATT: (chittering)

4083
03:01:54.851 --> 03:01:59.617
LAURA: Sprinkle says he's real happy exactly where he is.
(Matt and Sam laughing)

4084
03:01:59.617 --> 03:02:01.301
TRAVIS: (squeaky voice) She's squeezing me.

4085
03:02:01.301 --> 03:02:03.475
(laughter)

4086
03:02:03.475 --> 03:02:06.314
LIAM: Let Essek check, and then perhaps,

4087
03:02:06.314 --> 03:02:08.251
if it turns up what we fear it does,

4088
03:02:08.251 --> 03:02:10.746
then a new line of questions is in order,

4089
03:02:10.746 --> 03:02:13.146
not why have you betrayed your people,

4090
03:02:13.146 --> 03:02:16.193
but how long have you been experiencing this,

4091
03:02:16.193 --> 03:02:21.193
do you remember meeting anyone, do you remember a trigger?

4092
03:02:21.236 --> 03:02:24.049
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't know, if there's any other--

4093
03:02:24.049 --> 03:02:25.505
SAM: He's been dead for weeks.

4094
03:02:25.505 --> 03:02:27.989
ASHLEY: -- answers you guys need.

4095
03:02:27.989 --> 03:02:29.903
LIAM: Stiff as a board.

4096
03:02:29.903 --> 03:02:32.408
(laughter)

4097
03:02:32.408 --> 03:02:34.719
LIAM: Like a cat scratcher.

4098
03:02:34.719 --> 03:02:38.386
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

4099
03:02:39.415 --> 03:02:42.824
LAURA: He's not dead! He's not dead; he's alive!

4100
03:02:42.824 --> 03:02:43.741
Stop it.

4101
03:02:43.741 --> 03:02:47.142
(laughter)

4102
03:02:47.142 --> 03:02:49.860
MARISHA: He's bloated; he's just an airplane pillow now.

4103
03:02:49.860 --> 03:02:51.570
(laughter)
TRAVIS: (as Jester) Eat it! Eat it!

4104
03:02:51.570 --> 03:02:53.311
LIAM: Wait, wait, one second.

4105
03:02:53.311 --> 03:02:55.626
(scratching)

4106
03:02:55.626 --> 03:02:57.126
MATT: You're terrible.

4107
03:02:57.988 --> 03:03:00.007
LAURA: He's alive!

4108
03:03:00.007 --> 03:03:02.504
Move, show them.

4109
03:03:02.504 --> 03:03:03.681
Move!

4110
03:03:03.681 --> 03:03:05.246
(laughter)

4111
03:03:05.246 --> 03:03:06.079
LAURA: See?

4112
03:03:06.079 --> 03:03:08.079
TRAVIS: Show them you're fine!

4113
03:03:09.372 --> 03:03:10.674
ASHLEY: Did he move?

4114
03:03:10.674 --> 03:03:12.514
LAURA: He did, he bit my finger, okay?

4115
03:03:12.514 --> 03:03:13.555
He's fine.

4116
03:03:13.555 --> 03:03:14.996
TRAVIS: Rigor mortis is a bitch.

4117
03:03:14.996 --> 03:03:16.629
MARISHA: "Show them you're fine."

4118
03:03:16.629 --> 03:03:18.946
MATT: I'm fighting every urge to make it canon.

4119
03:03:18.946 --> 03:03:20.702
(laughter)

4120
03:03:20.702 --> 03:03:22.674
But I'm not going to do that.
LAURA: He's not dead.

4121
03:03:22.674 --> 03:03:25.077
Just think of it like any time he seems like

4122
03:03:25.077 --> 03:03:27.996
he's a little bit hmm, I give him a little healing spell.

4123
03:03:27.996 --> 03:03:29.293
(laughter)

4124
03:03:29.293 --> 03:03:30.309
He's okay.

4125
03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:33.745
LIAM: She's just Weekend at Bernie-ing him at this point.

4126
03:03:33.745 --> 03:03:37.336
"Oh, he bit me, ow, that's very naughty, Sprinkle."

4127
03:03:37.336 --> 03:03:40.647
MARISHA: I've been to the other side 12 times!

4128
03:03:40.647 --> 03:03:42.246
LAURA: Stop it, he's alive, stop it, stop it.

4129
03:03:42.246 --> 03:03:43.639
It's not canon, he's alive, stop it.

4130
03:03:43.639 --> 03:03:44.833
TALIESIN: He's alive.

4131
03:03:44.833 --> 03:03:46.311
TRAVIS: Set me free.

4132
03:03:46.311 --> 03:03:48.015
MARISHA: Better for CPS.

4133
03:03:48.015 --> 03:03:49.988
LIAM: Welcome to the Bates Motel, Sprinkle.

4134
03:03:49.988 --> 03:03:52.662
ASHLEY: Maybe we could, you know, if we find

4135
03:03:52.662 --> 03:03:57.530
a very beautiful place, we could let him go into a forest.

4136
03:03:57.530 --> 03:03:59.669
SAM: Are you talking about the prisoner, or Sprinkle?

4137
03:03:59.669 --> 03:04:01.878
ASHLEY: No, I'm talking about Sprinkle.

4138
03:04:01.878 --> 03:04:04.545
(laughter)

4139
03:04:06.018 --> 03:04:08.468
LAURA: You know, I asked Sprinkle if he wanted

4140
03:04:08.468 --> 03:04:10.735
to go hang out with what's-his-name, the guy,

4141
03:04:10.735 --> 03:04:13.262
the guy that likes the animals, what's his name?

4142
03:04:13.262 --> 03:04:16.847
SAM: Oh, yeah, the wizard man.

4143
03:04:16.847 --> 03:04:17.924
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4144
03:04:17.924 --> 03:04:18.940
MATT: Ah, we broke Taliesin.

4145
03:04:18.940 --> 03:04:20.456
MARISHA: Oremid Hass?

4146
03:04:20.456 --> 03:04:21.770
LAURA: Oremid Hass.

4147
03:04:21.770 --> 03:04:24.591
And Sprinkle came back to <i>me</i>, okay?

4148
03:04:24.591 --> 03:04:25.952
He didn't want to go with Oremid Hass,

4149
03:04:25.952 --> 03:04:28.285
he wants to stay with me. You all--

4150
03:04:28.285 --> 03:04:30.086
(laughter)

4151
03:04:30.086 --> 03:04:31.211
LIAM: Mother?

4152
03:04:31.211 --> 03:04:34.494
(laughter)

4153
03:04:34.494 --> 03:04:36.335
MARISHA: ♪ Mother can you hear me? ♪

4154
03:04:36.335 --> 03:04:40.376
(laughter)

4155
03:04:40.376 --> 03:04:42.703
TALIESIN: I'm staying the fuck outta this, man.

4156
03:04:42.703 --> 03:04:44.294
MARISHA: Essek, go check on the guy's neck.

4157
03:04:44.294 --> 03:04:45.583
MATT: He's already gone.

4158
03:04:45.583 --> 03:04:48.250
(laughter)

4159
03:04:50.233 --> 03:04:51.290
MATT: Okay.

4160
03:04:51.290 --> 03:04:52.905
TALIESIN: Oh, I can't see straight.

4161
03:04:52.905 --> 03:04:53.892
Oh man.

4162
03:04:53.892 --> 03:04:55.972
(laughter)

4163
03:04:55.972 --> 03:04:58.347
ASHLEY: That's amazing.
TALIESIN: Wow.

4164
03:04:59.514 --> 03:05:00.805
Oh, wow.

4165
03:05:00.805 --> 03:05:04.123
MATT: Essek returns, a few moments later, and says--

4166
03:05:04.123 --> 03:05:06.373
MARISHA: What does the light mean?

4167
03:05:10.300 --> 03:05:14.733
MATT: "I did not see any mark
on the back of his neck, but--"

4168
03:05:14.733 --> 03:05:16.207
SAM: Insight check.

4169
03:05:16.207 --> 03:05:18.035
MATT: Make an insight check.

4170
03:05:18.035 --> 03:05:19.788
LAURA: He's telling the truth.

4171
03:05:19.788 --> 03:05:22.733
SAM: 18 plus five!

4172
03:05:22.733 --> 03:05:24.520
Ooh, I'm so insightful.

4173
03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:25.998
MATT: 18 plus five.

4174
03:05:25.998 --> 03:05:27.095
(Laura gasps)

4175
03:05:27.095 --> 03:05:29.002
LIAM: Whispers for Nott!

4176
03:05:29.002 --> 03:05:31.593
LAURA: Oh dude, I just realized
what your shirt is, it's awesome.

4177
03:05:31.593 --> 03:05:33.710
SAM: Skillshare is a wonderful app.

4178
03:05:33.710 --> 03:05:36.636
LIAM: Don't talk through your whisper.

4179
03:05:36.636 --> 03:05:39.587
TRAVIS: That's the funniest shit.

4180
03:05:39.587 --> 03:05:41.467
"Eat it, eat it!"

4181
03:05:41.467 --> 03:05:44.145
Oh my god, Jester, Sprinkle's dead.

4182
03:05:44.145 --> 03:05:46.495
TALIESIN: Started getting tunnel vision.
TRAVIS: Been dead for weeks.

4183
03:05:46.495 --> 03:05:47.328
LAURA: No!

4184
03:05:47.328 --> 03:05:48.804
TALIESIN: I could see down the hall.

4185
03:05:48.804 --> 03:05:51.818
MARISHA: Yeah, just completely mouth agape.

4186
03:05:51.818 --> 03:05:53.755
TRAVIS: Expression of terror.

4187
03:05:53.755 --> 03:05:55.672
LIAM: Oh look, he's eating.

4188
03:05:56.556 --> 03:05:57.961
TRAVIS: He's very picky.

4189
03:05:57.961 --> 03:05:59.487
(laughter)

4190
03:05:59.487 --> 03:06:00.654
TALIESIN: Nope, not--

4191
03:06:01.706 --> 03:06:03.893
MARISHA: He's been dead since the Underdark.

4192
03:06:03.893 --> 03:06:06.476
MATT: "So, it is curious,

4193
03:06:06.476 --> 03:06:09.853
"if this is the assumption

4194
03:06:09.853 --> 03:06:12.701
"that perhaps this Obann figure had him under his control,

4195
03:06:12.701 --> 03:06:15.286
"there would be this mark, you say?

4196
03:06:15.286 --> 03:06:17.945
"Since it's not there, it's a possibility

4197
03:06:17.945 --> 03:06:20.838
"that either it was removed, or perhaps there was

4198
03:06:20.838 --> 03:06:23.467
"other magic involved in erasing a trace."

4199
03:06:23.467 --> 03:06:26.105
ASHLEY: Could've been something else.

4200
03:06:26.105 --> 03:06:31.029
MATT: "Was the mark forcefully
removed from you or anything?"

4201
03:06:31.029 --> 03:06:33.266
LAURA: Oh, it was, actually.

4202
03:06:33.266 --> 03:06:35.540
MATT: "That could be the difference."

4203
03:06:35.540 --> 03:06:36.804
LAURA: Oh.

4204
03:06:36.804 --> 03:06:37.832
TALIESIN: Hmm.

4205
03:06:37.832 --> 03:06:40.273
MATT: "But. (sighs)"

4206
03:06:40.273 --> 03:06:42.848
TALIESIN: Certainly explains a
few things though, doesn't it?

4207
03:06:42.848 --> 03:06:46.072
MATT: "Does not seem to be in a physical state

4208
03:06:46.072 --> 03:06:49.119
"for future interrogation, necessarily,

4209
03:06:49.119 --> 03:06:51.426
"and time draws short with the Bright Queen,

4210
03:06:51.426 --> 03:06:52.779
"so if we are to make our cause there,

4211
03:06:52.779 --> 03:06:56.832
"we should definitely get on our way to the Bastion."

4212
03:06:56.832 --> 03:06:58.842
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4213
03:06:58.842 --> 03:07:00.842
We're going to talk to her.

4214
03:07:00.842 --> 03:07:03.121
MARISHA: While we would walk to the Bright Queen,

4215
03:07:03.121 --> 03:07:05.315
because I want to keep this going,

4216
03:07:05.315 --> 03:07:08.318
have we scryed on Vence here lately?

4217
03:07:08.318 --> 03:07:10.297
LAURA: Well, he's got a thing.
SAM: He's got protection.

4218
03:07:10.297 --> 03:07:13.525
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.
LAURA: But I can try it, but it would be

4219
03:07:13.525 --> 03:07:15.212
really, really hard to scry.

4220
03:07:15.212 --> 03:07:17.487
SAM: No, he's got something to block it.
MARISHA: He's got a thing, like, he's got.

4221
03:07:17.487 --> 03:07:18.380
LIAM: The only way he would not have it

4222
03:07:18.380 --> 03:07:21.098
is if the Empire has caught up to him.

4223
03:07:21.098 --> 03:07:22.140
<i>Ja</i>.

4224
03:07:22.140 --> 03:07:25.225
So he is either off the grid, or--

4225
03:07:25.225 --> 03:07:28.653
LAURA: Like, it's impossible to scry on you.

4226
03:07:28.653 --> 03:07:32.756
It doesn't like, sometimes work and sometimes doesn't?

4227
03:07:32.756 --> 03:07:34.381
LIAM: For him, I think it is impossible,

4228
03:07:34.381 --> 03:07:36.597
because he is most likely traveling alone.

4229
03:07:36.597 --> 03:07:40.450
I am a bit compromised because you are all

4230
03:07:40.450 --> 03:07:43.423
not protected like I am, so.

4231
03:07:43.423 --> 03:07:45.949
LAURA: Should we always stay a little bit away from you?

4232
03:07:45.949 --> 03:07:48.271
LIAM: I hope not.

4233
03:07:48.271 --> 03:07:49.830
MATT: Hmm.

4234
03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:52.187
(Matt and Laura chuckling)

4235
03:07:52.187 --> 03:07:55.906
SAM: Could scry on Darrow to see who his client is.

4236
03:07:55.906 --> 03:07:57.578
LAURA: I was thinking about that, actually.

4237
03:07:57.578 --> 03:07:58.571
SAM: But that's not urgent.

4238
03:07:58.571 --> 03:08:00.665
LAURA: You know, because he's like, not going to tell us,

4239
03:08:00.665 --> 03:08:01.784
we could just find out on our own.

4240
03:08:01.784 --> 03:08:03.354
SAM: Yeah, fuck that guy.

4241
03:08:03.354 --> 03:08:05.345
LAURA: No, don't fuck that guy, I mean,

4242
03:08:05.345 --> 03:08:07.342
fuck him if Fjord doesn't like him,

4243
03:08:07.342 --> 03:08:10.731
but he's pretty nice, I thought he was funny.
TRAVIS: He hates weasels.

4244
03:08:10.731 --> 03:08:12.130
ASHLEY: How long was he down there?

4245
03:08:12.130 --> 03:08:13.405
In the prison?

4246
03:08:13.405 --> 03:08:16.670
MATT: From what you hear, roughly two days.

4247
03:08:16.670 --> 03:08:18.069
ASHLEY: No, Fjord.

4248
03:08:18.069 --> 03:08:20.989
MATT: Oh, Fjord. (laughs)

4249
03:08:20.989 --> 03:08:25.428
Fjord was gone from you guys, I'd say for about, altogether,

4250
03:08:26.920 --> 03:08:28.720
15, 20 minutes.

4251
03:08:29.762 --> 03:08:31.942
Probably a little longer than that, because of travel and everything.
SAM: Quickest prison stint ever.

4252
03:08:31.942 --> 03:08:33.775
TRAVIS: Hard time.

4253
03:08:33.775 --> 03:08:36.765
SAM: How do you feel, being locked up for so long?

4254
03:08:36.765 --> 03:08:39.145
TRAVIS: Changed man. Forgot what the sky looked like.

4255
03:08:39.145 --> 03:08:41.053
LIAM: Scared straight.

4256
03:08:43.509 --> 03:08:47.177
MATT: All right, so are you stopping to scry on anybody, or?

4257
03:08:47.177 --> 03:08:48.344
TRAVIS: You want to try it?

4258
03:08:48.344 --> 03:08:49.373
LAURA: You want to do it, like, now?

4259
03:08:49.373 --> 03:08:50.207
SAM: That's low priority.

4260
03:08:50.207 --> 03:08:51.429
Let's get the queen.

4261
03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:52.640
LAURA: Let's just get to the Bright Queen.

4262
03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:54.898
MATT: Okay.

4263
03:08:54.898 --> 03:08:57.038
You make your way back up to the surface of Rosohna.

4264
03:08:57.038 --> 03:09:00.040
At this point it is evening, though the light

4265
03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:03.163
has not changed throughout the sky.

4266
03:09:03.163 --> 03:09:04.814
You make your way to the Lucid Bastion

4267
03:09:04.814 --> 03:09:09.668
and along the escort of the Shadowhand Essek.

4268
03:09:09.668 --> 03:09:12.649
Led within, some of the guards give some odd looks,

4269
03:09:12.649 --> 03:09:16.873
recognizing (chuckling) your arrival not long ago

4270
03:09:16.873 --> 03:09:18.372
in very different attire.

4271
03:09:18.372 --> 03:09:20.613
LAURA: Well, we look the same, just Fjord, really.

4272
03:09:20.613 --> 03:09:23.428
MATT: Well, not all of you got Seeming immediately.

4273
03:09:23.428 --> 03:09:24.445
LAURA: That's true.

4274
03:09:24.445 --> 03:09:26.347
MATT: You made it a little ways through the Lucid Bastion

4275
03:09:26.347 --> 03:09:28.237
before the Seeming was applied.

4276
03:09:28.237 --> 03:09:29.697
TRAVIS: And then changed, for some reason.

4277
03:09:29.697 --> 03:09:30.922
MATT: Yeah.

4278
03:09:32.394 --> 03:09:36.070
But there is no wait period, actually.

4279
03:09:36.070 --> 03:09:37.666
You are brought to the antechamber

4280
03:09:37.666 --> 03:09:39.202
where you had previously had to wait,

4281
03:09:39.202 --> 03:09:42.817
but there is immediately, as Essek pushes forward

4282
03:09:42.817 --> 03:09:45.195
escorting you, the doors open into the interior

4283
03:09:45.195 --> 03:09:48.207
of the Bright Queen's chamber, the glowing white orb

4284
03:09:48.207 --> 03:09:51.404
of light above, the chains still holding affixed,

4285
03:09:51.404 --> 03:09:54.225
arcing at an angle to all the far corners

4286
03:09:54.225 --> 03:09:57.888
of the climbing, crystalline interior.

4287
03:09:57.888 --> 03:09:59.526
You can see the climbing stairs that lead

4288
03:09:59.526 --> 03:10:01.302
to the various members of the dens

4289
03:10:01.302 --> 03:10:05.841
that comprise the the council around the Bright Queen,

4290
03:10:05.841 --> 03:10:09.591
and the conversation is all about, let's see.

4291
03:10:12.706 --> 03:10:15.655
Two of you make a perception check.

4292
03:10:15.655 --> 03:10:16.738
SAM: Not me.

4293
03:10:16.738 --> 03:10:18.738
TALIESIN: I'll take one.
LIAM: I'll do it.

4294
03:10:20.194 --> 03:10:21.504
TRAVIS: Oof.

4295
03:10:21.504 --> 03:10:23.025
TALIESIN: That's not my best, but that's okay, 18.

4296
03:10:23.025 --> 03:10:24.270
LIAM: Oh, I got a one.

4297
03:10:24.270 --> 03:10:25.390
MATT: Okay.

4298
03:10:25.390 --> 03:10:26.816
Unable to make out the details

4299
03:10:26.816 --> 03:10:28.465
of any of the hushed conversation,

4300
03:10:28.465 --> 03:10:30.138
some arguments that are happening,

4301
03:10:30.138 --> 03:10:34.032
you hear the din around you, but the the wide expanse

4302
03:10:34.032 --> 03:10:35.664
that is the interior of this chamber

4303
03:10:35.664 --> 03:10:38.557
causes a little bit of an echo and reverb effect,

4304
03:10:38.557 --> 03:10:41.781
and you're unable to make out the specifics.

4305
03:10:41.781 --> 03:10:44.977
But it seems to be heated, and as you approach,

4306
03:10:44.977 --> 03:10:47.553
dying down a bit as attention begins to come to you

4307
03:10:47.553 --> 03:10:50.446
and Essek as you approach.

4308
03:10:50.446 --> 03:10:53.480
There you can see, atop the throne,

4309
03:10:53.480 --> 03:10:57.070
the Bright Queen herself stands as you approach,

4310
03:10:57.070 --> 03:10:59.664
and Essek raises a hand and then

4311
03:10:59.664 --> 03:11:02.247
kneels before the Bright Queen.

4312
03:11:04.633 --> 03:11:06.546
You all kneel as well?

4313
03:11:06.546 --> 03:11:08.023
ALL: Yes.

4314
03:11:08.023 --> 03:11:09.273
MATT: All right.

4315
03:11:11.491 --> 03:11:15.191
The Bright Queen looks, places her staff to the side.

4316
03:11:16.057 --> 03:11:18.344
The echo of the impact--

4317
03:11:18.344 --> 03:11:19.535
MARISHA: What is she wearing?

4318
03:11:19.535 --> 03:11:20.715
LAURA: I know, I was going to ask the same thing.

4319
03:11:20.715 --> 03:11:22.388
What is she wearing?

4320
03:11:22.388 --> 03:11:25.751
MATT: She looks fabulous as always.

4321
03:11:25.751 --> 03:11:29.652
Given the recent events, you can see beyond the the dress

4322
03:11:29.652 --> 03:11:31.216
when you first made an appearance,

4323
03:11:31.216 --> 03:11:35.017
this one falls more in line with the more armored attire.

4324
03:11:35.017 --> 03:11:37.895
The dress portion of it is shorter,

4325
03:11:37.895 --> 03:11:40.285
just going, you know, just past the floor and ankles,

4326
03:11:40.285 --> 03:11:42.196
the armor itself similar the one

4327
03:11:42.196 --> 03:11:44.384
you saw her last adorned with.

4328
03:11:44.384 --> 03:11:47.015
You can see the the same crest of horns,

4329
03:11:47.015 --> 03:11:50.006
but as supposed to a crown, it's a little more of a helmet

4330
03:11:50.006 --> 03:11:51.665
with sides that curl out a bit,

4331
03:11:51.665 --> 03:11:54.327
and she looks like she is a little more

4332
03:11:54.327 --> 03:11:59.112
stepping towards a battle-ready persona.

4333
03:11:59.112 --> 03:12:00.182
LIAM: Oh shit.

4334
03:12:00.182 --> 03:12:02.720
MATT: As she looks out amongst all of you and goes,

4335
03:12:02.720 --> 03:12:06.429
"Mighty Nein, welcome back.

4336
03:12:07.683 --> 03:12:12.391
"You have been quite the topic of conversation recently."

4337
03:12:13.431 --> 03:12:17.764
Gives a motion for you all to rise and approach.

4338
03:12:19.277 --> 03:12:23.659
"A friend of yours recently stormed our own doors,

4339
03:12:23.659 --> 03:12:28.635
"claiming manipulation in the name of an unseen enemy.

4340
03:12:29.546 --> 03:12:34.546
"A name we recognize, though seldom more than a fairy tale.

4341
03:12:35.209 --> 03:12:39.415
"To her credit, she holds no benefit I can see

4342
03:12:39.415 --> 03:12:42.078
"in meddling in the affairs of our continent,

4343
03:12:42.078 --> 03:12:44.737
"and staked your names on this warning,

4344
03:12:44.737 --> 03:12:47.618
"which was a persuasive appeal.

4345
03:12:47.618 --> 03:12:51.135
"Enough to stem the tide of blood

4346
03:12:51.135 --> 03:12:54.370
"where it might have been earned.

4347
03:12:54.370 --> 03:12:59.363
"So. Our distant ears tell a tale of a battle

4348
03:12:59.363 --> 03:13:03.018
"of another kind beneath the city,

4349
03:13:03.018 --> 03:13:07.845
"one that you all seem to have survived in Rexxentrum.

4350
03:13:07.845 --> 03:13:09.145
"Well done.

4351
03:13:11.215 --> 03:13:14.002
"These same ears have also heard of your arrival

4352
03:13:14.002 --> 03:13:17.522
"at the imperial castle, a strange destination

4353
03:13:17.522 --> 03:13:20.730
"for such self-proclaimed expatriates.

4354
03:13:22.989 --> 03:13:24.331
"Explain yourselves."

4355
03:13:25.542 --> 03:13:26.475
TALIESIN: Expatriate?

4356
03:13:26.475 --> 03:13:27.522
SAM: We should take care of this.

4357
03:13:27.522 --> 03:13:30.330
LAURA: Yeah, probably. Do you want us to talk about--

4358
03:13:30.330 --> 03:13:33.390
TALIESIN: Oh. I'm not even from-- well, all right.

4359
03:13:33.390 --> 03:13:35.762
LAURA: Well, neither are we.
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4360
03:13:35.762 --> 03:13:38.123
MARISHA: Maybe that clarification is warranted?

4361
03:13:38.123 --> 03:13:42.504
TRAVIS: We can understand the way this may have looked.

4362
03:13:42.504 --> 03:13:45.527
I'm sure it's certainly quite confusing.

4363
03:13:45.527 --> 03:13:48.317
We have been on the trail, as we said before,

4364
03:13:48.317 --> 03:13:51.976
of these cultists of the Angel of Irons.

4365
03:13:51.976 --> 03:13:55.407
Our search led us to Rexxentrum, back into the Empire,

4366
03:13:55.407 --> 03:13:58.507
where we thwarted our foes in an effort,

4367
03:13:58.507 --> 03:14:01.961
in their efforts to break one of the shackles

4368
03:14:01.961 --> 03:14:06.961
that was holding a far greater foe: the Chained Oblivion.

4369
03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:11.483
We toppled some of our quarry, and have uncovered a bit more

4370
03:14:11.483 --> 03:14:15.457
about your previous inquiries, beacons,

4371
03:14:15.457 --> 03:14:20.124
the Empire's involvement, their knowledge of your Luxon.

4372
03:14:22.108 --> 03:14:23.916
MATT: "We had reason to believe that this beacon

4373
03:14:23.916 --> 03:14:26.899
"is being held by the Cerberus Assembly

4374
03:14:26.899 --> 03:14:29.354
"within the capital of Rexxentrum.

4375
03:14:29.354 --> 03:14:32.353
"Have you confirmed this with your eyes, then?"

4376
03:14:32.353 --> 03:14:33.186
SAM: No.

4377
03:14:33.186 --> 03:14:35.845
TRAVIS: We've confirmed that it is not within

4378
03:14:35.845 --> 03:14:37.726
the city of Rexxentrum.

4379
03:14:37.726 --> 03:14:40.497
MATT: Essek immediately takes her gaze,

4380
03:14:40.497 --> 03:14:45.286
and Essek goes, "My queen, we have, as you know,

4381
03:14:45.286 --> 03:14:48.973
"arrested one of our higher dens."

4382
03:14:48.973 --> 03:14:53.067
He makes a gesture towards

4383
03:14:53.067 --> 03:14:55.804
one of the empty chairs within the chamber.

4384
03:14:55.804 --> 03:14:56.833
LAURA: Whoa.

4385
03:14:56.833 --> 03:14:58.700
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

4386
03:14:58.700 --> 03:15:02.633
MATT: "And the interrogation has been fruitful.

4387
03:15:02.633 --> 03:15:05.974
"As much as it hurts us to admit,

4388
03:15:05.974 --> 03:15:09.591
"our very own Taskhand Adeen

4389
03:15:10.533 --> 03:15:15.491
"has admitted to the deed

4390
03:15:16.830 --> 03:15:21.765
"of both giving aid and progressing the interests

4391
03:15:21.765 --> 03:15:25.606
"of this cult of the Chained Oblivion,

4392
03:15:26.961 --> 03:15:31.696
"and was responsible, it seems, for giving our beacons

4393
03:15:31.696 --> 03:15:34.120
"to the Empire in the first place."

4394
03:15:34.120 --> 03:15:37.757
The room immediately goes into whispers

4395
03:15:37.757 --> 03:15:41.268
and pearl-clutching gasps, and the Bright Queen

4396
03:15:41.268 --> 03:15:44.087
immediately slams her staff twice in the ground

4397
03:15:44.087 --> 03:15:46.246
to silence the room.

4398
03:15:47.149 --> 03:15:48.340
MATT: "Indeed.

4399
03:15:51.015 --> 03:15:52.165
"Well then.

4400
03:15:53.442 --> 03:15:57.246
"That reckoning will be something to deal with."

4401
03:15:57.246 --> 03:15:59.404
SAM: Well.
LAURA: Essek, tell--

4402
03:16:00.864 --> 03:16:03.198
may I speak, your majesty?

4403
03:16:04.357 --> 03:16:05.490
MATT: "Please."

4404
03:16:07.082 --> 03:16:10.586
LAURA: The Angel of Irons cult is well known

4405
03:16:10.586 --> 03:16:14.869
for mind control. It's one of the tools

4406
03:16:14.869 --> 03:16:18.717
that they use the most within their ranks,

4407
03:16:19.585 --> 03:16:24.300
and we have reason to believe that some of the people

4408
03:16:24.300 --> 03:16:26.814
that were doing deeds for them

4409
03:16:26.814 --> 03:16:31.413
didn't even do it by their own fruition.

4410
03:16:33.078 --> 03:16:37.989
MATT: "Then, pray tell,
who is this individual

4411
03:16:37.989 --> 03:16:42.076
"who might have been
responsible for influencing

4412
03:16:42.076 --> 03:16:46.147
"the mind of one of
our great leaders here?

4413
03:16:46.147 --> 03:16:50.645
LAURA: Well, there was a
man working named Obann,

4414
03:16:50.645 --> 03:16:54.570
who was a very high up--
I think he was a devil?

4415
03:16:54.570 --> 03:16:56.607
MATT: "You had mentioned this figure before."

4416
03:16:56.607 --> 03:17:00.370
LAURA: Yes, yes, he could disguise
himself as other people,

4417
03:17:00.370 --> 03:17:04.604
he was controlling people that we know

4418
03:17:05.772 --> 03:17:10.381
to do terrible things,
and some of his followers

4419
03:17:10.381 --> 03:17:12.295
were not by choice.

4420
03:17:13.691 --> 03:17:17.825
If it's possible, he may have
come across your Taskhand

4421
03:17:17.825 --> 03:17:19.748
and done the same to him.

4422
03:17:19.748 --> 03:17:22.917
SAM: We have reason to believe that your ally

4423
03:17:22.917 --> 03:17:27.042
was at least under some sort of mind influence.

4424
03:17:27.972 --> 03:17:32.324
MATT: "And you had been seeking this Obann, yes?"

4425
03:17:32.324 --> 03:17:35.016
TRAVIS: Yeah, for quite a while.

4426
03:17:35.016 --> 03:17:36.493
LAURA: He's a really bad, bad guy.

4427
03:17:36.493 --> 03:17:40.183
MATT: "And how close are you
to bringing him to justice?"

4428
03:17:40.183 --> 03:17:42.973
LAURA: That guy's smooshed.

4429
03:17:42.973 --> 03:17:46.710
TRAVIS: We are happy to report
that Obann has been dealt with,

4430
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:48.920
quite handily. He has failed at his task

4431
03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:51.290
and has not only been punished by us,

4432
03:17:51.290 --> 03:17:53.967
but also the god that he serves.

4433
03:17:53.967 --> 03:17:57.159
TALIESIN: Including some of those
that he had control over

4434
03:17:57.159 --> 03:18:00.459
breaking free, turning on him,
and helping us to destroy him.

4435
03:18:01.536 --> 03:18:04.306
MATT: "And these individuals
that have been broken free,

4436
03:18:04.306 --> 03:18:07.639
"they renounce the things they've done?"

4437
03:18:08.763 --> 03:18:11.513
TALIESIN: I don't know anyone who didn't.

4438
03:18:13.016 --> 03:18:14.683
ASHLEY: I'll step forward.

4439
03:18:17.897 --> 03:18:20.064
I was one of those people.

4440
03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:28.018
And I should hope that if I was ever

4441
03:18:28.018 --> 03:18:30.535
in the position of judgment, that...

4442
03:18:36.301 --> 03:18:40.126
I didn't choose to do
the things that he had me do.

4443
03:18:43.844 --> 03:18:48.344
But we took care of him,
and he is now a...

4444
03:18:49.402 --> 03:18:50.585
a blob.

4445
03:18:56.391 --> 03:18:58.224
MATT: "Come closer, please."

4446
03:18:59.832 --> 03:19:01.132
ASHLEY: I step closer.

4447
03:19:06.415 --> 03:19:09.498
MATT: "And you believe you are redeemable?"

4448
03:19:14.399 --> 03:19:15.982
ASHLEY: I should hope so.

4449
03:19:21.536 --> 03:19:24.027
MATT: "Well, my judgment...

4450
03:19:26.928 --> 03:19:29.069
"will stand as it will be,

4451
03:19:29.069 --> 03:19:31.225
"based on what arises.

4452
03:19:32.482 --> 03:19:34.899
"I thank you for your counsel.

4453
03:19:38.173 --> 03:19:40.873
"As we have no Obann to...

4454
03:19:42.122 --> 03:19:44.222
"punish within Rosohna,

4455
03:19:46.391 --> 03:19:51.376
"punishment must still be
dealt, with a terrible deed

4456
03:19:51.376 --> 03:19:55.126
"that has been done against us and our people."

4457
03:19:55.126 --> 03:19:57.927
The woman sitting in the
chair next to the Bright Queen,

4458
03:19:57.927 --> 03:20:00.039
who you've seen before, quiet, armored,

4459
03:20:00.039 --> 03:20:03.235
very much a, what you would assume to be

4460
03:20:03.235 --> 03:20:06.065
a military figure of very
high station steps forward,

4461
03:20:06.065 --> 03:20:09.365
another female drow, goes, "My queen."

4462
03:20:10.768 --> 03:20:14.442
Everyone gets quiet, and the people turn.

4463
03:20:14.442 --> 03:20:18.159
"I implore you to listen

4464
03:20:18.159 --> 03:20:21.717
"and keep your temperament

4465
03:20:21.717 --> 03:20:25.292
"outside the judgment of law.

4466
03:20:27.169 --> 03:20:28.369
"Please."

4467
03:20:31.357 --> 03:20:34.507
This is an insolent--

4468
03:20:34.507 --> 03:20:38.824
in the chain of royal command,

4469
03:20:38.824 --> 03:20:41.585
this would be easily
punished in the other court,

4470
03:20:41.585 --> 03:20:44.593
and the Bright Queen turns
and softens and goes,

4471
03:20:46.143 --> 03:20:47.968
"Of course, it will.

4472
03:20:51.459 --> 03:20:52.534
"(small sigh)

4473
03:20:54.195 --> 03:20:56.770
"So, Essek.

4474
03:20:58.389 --> 03:21:03.378
"The prisoner will be ready for judgment tomorrow,

4475
03:21:03.378 --> 03:21:05.712
"I hope? If not sooner."

4476
03:21:05.712 --> 03:21:07.953
He goes, "Yes, my queen.

4477
03:21:07.953 --> 03:21:11.655
"The prisoner is in a difficult physical state.

4478
03:21:11.655 --> 03:21:13.780
"Tomorrow would be best.

4479
03:21:13.780 --> 03:21:15.470
"We can continue our interrogation,

4480
03:21:15.470 --> 03:21:19.886
"but the confession stands.

4481
03:21:19.886 --> 03:21:21.736
"But hopefully

4482
03:21:21.736 --> 03:21:23.735
"mercy can be considered."

4483
03:21:26.216 --> 03:21:28.994
She looks about. "Very well.

4484
03:21:28.994 --> 03:21:30.707
TRAVIS: If we may.

4485
03:21:30.707 --> 03:21:34.973
TALIESIN: There is a another issue to be reported.

4486
03:21:34.973 --> 03:21:37.100
LIAM: Yes, we have a further development

4487
03:21:37.100 --> 03:21:39.907
you will be interested to know.

4488
03:21:39.907 --> 03:21:42.909
MATT: (as the Bright Queen)
"Then please, share it with us."

4489
03:21:42.909 --> 03:21:45.942
LIAM: Well, as you know,
the Empire is in possession

4490
03:21:45.942 --> 03:21:48.883
of another one of your
cherished artifacts.

4491
03:21:51.443 --> 03:21:56.443
They would like to return it to you.

4492
03:21:57.334 --> 03:22:02.124
MATT: That gasp and hush sound
is replaced with an

4493
03:22:02.124 --> 03:22:06.115
absolute still silence that hangs,

4494
03:22:07.215 --> 03:22:08.306
and hangs,

4495
03:22:09.465 --> 03:22:10.656
and hangs.

4496
03:22:12.308 --> 03:22:15.442
(Bright Queen laughs)

4497
03:22:17.073 --> 03:22:20.093
"Surely you're jesting."

4498
03:22:20.093 --> 03:22:24.551
LIAM: We have had an audience
with Dwendal,

4499
03:22:26.576 --> 03:22:28.251
as you know.

4500
03:22:30.553 --> 03:22:34.826
We are not operatives for the Empire.

4501
03:22:34.826 --> 03:22:39.677
We stand between two nations, and still desire

4502
03:22:39.677 --> 03:22:42.927
the very same thing we told you before.

4503
03:22:45.547 --> 03:22:50.027
Dwendal and the Assembly are offering

4504
03:22:50.027 --> 03:22:52.643
to return a beacon to you.

4505
03:22:55.485 --> 03:22:57.176
And I must confess,

4506
03:22:59.954 --> 03:23:02.562
we have our suspicions

4507
03:23:04.454 --> 03:23:06.865
about their intentions,

4508
03:23:06.865 --> 03:23:11.865
but I would beg you to delineate between

4509
03:23:11.948 --> 03:23:16.148
those running the Empire and its people.

4510
03:23:17.976 --> 03:23:22.473
We are here to represent
the <i>people</i> of the Empire,

4511
03:23:22.473 --> 03:23:26.426
and we would like to seize this opportunity

4512
03:23:27.318 --> 03:23:29.626
to make amends, not for everything,

4513
03:23:29.626 --> 03:23:34.226
not for all the wrongs done
to you and yours, but a start.

4514
03:23:36.864 --> 03:23:41.289
And we must tread carefully,
your highness.

4515
03:23:42.340 --> 03:23:47.250
Because those at the top,
the Assembly especially,

4516
03:23:47.250 --> 03:23:51.558
I fear are trying to bend
this situation to their will,

4517
03:23:53.608 --> 03:23:57.058
and gain the upper hand against you.

4518
03:24:00.163 --> 03:24:02.996
And we do not want that to happen.

4519
03:24:04.977 --> 03:24:08.785
We want to use this to end the violence,

4520
03:24:10.285 --> 03:24:11.835
against their will.

4521
03:24:14.275 --> 03:24:16.133
I do not serve you.

4522
03:24:17.308 --> 03:24:19.476
<i>We</i> do not serve you.

4523
03:24:19.476 --> 03:24:23.559
And we do not serve King Dwendal or the Assembly.

4524
03:24:25.579 --> 03:24:28.854
There is something far worse,

4525
03:24:28.854 --> 03:24:30.862
something far greater

4526
03:24:30.862 --> 03:24:35.861
than a nation coming for either of your peoples.

4527
03:24:39.612 --> 03:24:41.662
Tharizdun

4528
03:24:43.220 --> 03:24:44.370
is coming.

4529
03:24:48.660 --> 03:24:52.170
And Caleb puts his hands down and his head down

4530
03:24:52.170 --> 03:24:55.980
and gets as a supplicant as possible.

4531
03:24:55.980 --> 03:25:00.730
I beg of you to see the greater
threat to this world.

4532
03:25:02.828 --> 03:25:04.995
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

4533
03:25:13.634 --> 03:25:17.434
LIAM: I want to say it's cocked,
but it's mostly that,

4534
03:25:17.434 --> 03:25:19.051
so it's low.

4535
03:25:19.051 --> 03:25:19.916
SAM: It's a low cock?

4536
03:25:19.916 --> 03:25:21.918
LIAM: It's a low cock, it's nine.

4537
03:25:21.918 --> 03:25:22.809
MATT: It's a nine.

4538
03:25:22.809 --> 03:25:24.378
TRAVIS: How perfect.
LAURA: Yeah.

4539
03:25:24.378 --> 03:25:26.898
(Matt chuckles)

4540
03:25:26.898 --> 03:25:31.648
MATT: As you're prostrate, she slams
the staff on the ground.

4541
03:25:32.562 --> 03:25:34.845
"Please, no need to...

4542
03:25:36.703 --> 03:25:38.711
lie there before me."

4543
03:25:42.011 --> 03:25:43.697
LIAM: I beg to differ.

4544
03:25:43.697 --> 03:25:44.864
And he stands.

4545
03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:57.737
MATT: "I cannot lie, I'm very curious

4546
03:25:59.490 --> 03:26:02.306
"as to the circumstances
surrounding this...

4547
03:26:03.406 --> 03:26:05.872
"sudden offering.

4548
03:26:10.371 --> 03:26:15.038
"But I'm also not interested in discarding

4549
03:26:15.038 --> 03:26:17.705
"an opportunity in retrieving it.

4550
03:26:28.141 --> 03:26:32.332
"I don't know if I necessarily fear this...

4551
03:26:33.715 --> 03:26:36.491
"shadowed name you invoke

4552
03:26:36.491 --> 03:26:40.191
"more than I fear the violence of man.

4553
03:26:47.811 --> 03:26:49.894
"But we want what is ours.

4554
03:26:59.198 --> 03:27:01.113
"Do you have any idea what they wish

4555
03:27:01.113 --> 03:27:03.280
"in return for this beacon?"

4556
03:27:04.295 --> 03:27:06.217
MARISHA: Talks of peace.

4557
03:27:06.217 --> 03:27:08.380
LAURA: That's what they say.

4558
03:27:08.380 --> 03:27:11.386
TALIESIN: They were also coming
to terms with treachery

4559
03:27:11.386 --> 03:27:13.646
within their midst.

4560
03:27:13.646 --> 03:27:17.719
I think both of you have
that in common at the moment,

4561
03:27:17.719 --> 03:27:21.052
of how this cult has manipulated events.

4562
03:27:22.432 --> 03:27:25.758
MARISHA: Adeen has his own
counterpart on the Empire side

4563
03:27:25.758 --> 03:27:27.508
by the name of Vence.

4564
03:27:28.957 --> 03:27:32.195
I believe we've mentioned him to you in the past.

4565
03:27:32.195 --> 03:27:33.895
MATT: Essek raises a hand and goes,

4566
03:27:33.895 --> 03:27:36.100
"This Vence they speak of

4567
03:27:36.100 --> 03:27:40.358
"is, I believe, closely tied

4568
03:27:40.358 --> 03:27:44.208
"with the Martinet of the Assembly.

4569
03:27:45.054 --> 03:27:50.054
"So, while we are uncertain
how deep that hole goes,

4570
03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:54.878
"the treachery runs to the
top within the Empire as well."

4571
03:27:56.280 --> 03:27:58.606
TALIESIN: They suddenly find themselves not knowing

4572
03:27:58.606 --> 03:28:00.689
how much they don't know.

4573
03:28:02.563 --> 03:28:03.813
They're afraid.

4574
03:28:05.713 --> 03:28:08.496
I think now's the time to talk.

4575
03:28:10.589 --> 03:28:13.583
MATT: <i>You</i> make a persuasion check.

4576
03:28:13.583 --> 03:28:15.200
SAM: Come on, Caddy.

4577
03:28:17.547 --> 03:28:18.734
TALIESIN: 22.

4578
03:28:18.734 --> 03:28:21.334
SAM: Woo! Woo!
(Laura squeals)

4579
03:28:24.904 --> 03:28:27.423
MATT: "Fear is a powerful motivator."

4580
03:28:28.306 --> 03:28:30.941
TALIESIN: Always interesting when it's something

4581
03:28:30.941 --> 03:28:33.583
that two peoples have in common.

4582
03:28:34.985 --> 03:28:36.060
MATT: "Hm."

4583
03:28:37.944 --> 03:28:40.584
She looks back again at the captain,

4584
03:28:40.584 --> 03:28:41.896
who's standing behind her, and the captain

4585
03:28:41.896 --> 03:28:45.396
puts her hand on the shoulder
and gives her a stern look.

4586
03:28:49.615 --> 03:28:51.699
(sighs)

4587
03:28:55.846 --> 03:28:58.520
"And where would you like
this mediation to take place?"

4588
03:28:58.520 --> 03:29:01.431
SAM: We were thinking at sea, actually.

4589
03:29:01.431 --> 03:29:03.169
LAURA: Neutral ground?

4590
03:29:03.169 --> 03:29:05.939
SAM: A neutral place, away from both the Empire

4591
03:29:05.939 --> 03:29:08.047
and the Dynasty.

4592
03:29:08.047 --> 03:29:09.519
MATT: "Such as?"

4593
03:29:09.519 --> 03:29:13.225
SAM: Well, there's a lovely
cove that we could launch

4594
03:29:13.225 --> 03:29:16.267
some ships from in Nicodranas.

4595
03:29:16.267 --> 03:29:18.338
It's wonderful this time of year.

4596
03:29:18.338 --> 03:29:20.342
LAURA: Beautiful city.
SAM: Yes.

4597
03:29:20.342 --> 03:29:23.892
MATT: "We would look to probably bring our ships

4598
03:29:23.892 --> 03:29:28.892
"through the Lucidian Ocean,
maybe by ways White Dawn Lagoon.

4599
03:29:29.608 --> 03:29:33.108
"We could meet somewhere in between."

4600
03:29:34.591 --> 03:29:36.003
SAM: In between?

4601
03:29:36.003 --> 03:29:38.528
LAURA: The lagoon and Nicodranas, you mean?

4602
03:29:38.528 --> 03:29:39.361
MATT: "Yes."

4603
03:29:39.361 --> 03:29:42.495
SAM: Just somewhere on the Menagerie Coast?
LAURA: Oh wait, this isn't the Menagerie Coast map.

4604
03:29:42.495 --> 03:29:44.821
TALIESIN: Wrong map.
LAURA: All right, there we go.

4605
03:29:44.821 --> 03:29:47.748
LIAM: Down, move down.
LAURA: Where's Rumblecusp?

4606
03:29:47.748 --> 03:29:52.652
SAM: We assume that you would
not go in person, your highness?

4607
03:29:52.652 --> 03:29:54.983
MATT: "No, of course not,
that would be sheer folly.

4608
03:29:54.983 --> 03:29:56.145
"But we have--"

4609
03:29:56.145 --> 03:29:58.123
SAM: You may need to report.
LAURA: You've got fancy mirrors.

4610
03:29:58.123 --> 03:29:59.892
SAM: Who would go?

4611
03:29:59.892 --> 03:30:02.992
MATT: "We have means of communicating,

4612
03:30:02.992 --> 03:30:06.002
"and I am certain the higher
royalty in the king's court

4613
03:30:06.002 --> 03:30:10.707
"have such artifacts also
at their availability."

4614
03:30:12.462 --> 03:30:15.829
SAM: So we'd be bringing a few
artifacts out onto a boat,

4615
03:30:15.829 --> 03:30:17.928
and the artifacts would
sort of talk to each other?

4616
03:30:17.928 --> 03:30:19.108
TALIESIN: Along with--

4617
03:30:19.108 --> 03:30:21.108
LAURA: Some dignitaries, I'm assuming.

4618
03:30:21.108 --> 03:30:22.662
Some people?

4619
03:30:22.662 --> 03:30:26.600
Or would it just be the the artifacts?

4620
03:30:26.600 --> 03:30:31.580
MATT: "We will meet here,
along the southern edge

4621
03:30:31.580 --> 03:30:33.329
"of the Menagerie Coast.

4622
03:30:34.655 --> 03:30:38.813
"Neutral land, non war-bearing ships,

"them to bring their mirror,
we shall bring ours.

03:30:43.531 --> 03:30:48.423
"Representatives at the ready

03:30:49.388 --> 03:30:52.530
"The beacon is to be brought
as well to be transferred

03:30:52.530 --> 03:30:54.889
"upon agreement only."

4627
03:30:56.805 --> 03:30:59.728
TALIESIN: We can have the meeting
aboard our ship, if we have to.

4628
03:30:59.728 --> 03:31:01.441
LAURA: Yeah, we have a really nice one.

4629
03:31:01.441 --> 03:31:03.108
SAM: It's called the Ball Eater.

4630
03:31:03.108 --> 03:31:05.457
TALIESIN: That was not necessary.
LAURA: It's not a war ship, though.

4631
03:31:05.457 --> 03:31:07.756
MATT: "We will bring our prisoner,

4632
03:31:10.040 --> 03:31:11.631
"this traitor,

4633
03:31:13.488 --> 03:31:18.288
"and should they catch this
Vence, they bring theirs."

4634
03:31:18.288 --> 03:31:20.004
LAURA: (whispers) Oh, shit.

4635
03:31:20.004 --> 03:31:24.788
MATT: "Maybe somewhere in between,
we could learn something."

4636
03:31:26.587 --> 03:31:29.556
MARISHA: And what if they do not find Vence?

4637
03:31:29.556 --> 03:31:31.889
Or is that a non-negotiable?

4638
03:31:32.789 --> 03:31:37.789
MATT: "Then the negotiation becomes
strained, but not impossible.

4639
03:31:39.592 --> 03:31:42.694
"No arms at the immediate table.

03:32:11.480 --> 03:32:13.087
LAURA: Aww, man.

4648
03:32:13.087 --> 03:32:15.074
SAM: It's sort of our thing that we--

4649
03:32:15.074 --> 03:32:20.074
MARISHA: That was a request at
the behest of King Dwendal.

4650
03:32:20.448 --> 03:32:24.533
We are your liaisons that Allura mentioned

4651
03:32:24.533 --> 03:32:26.774
would be reporting to you.

4652
03:32:26.774 --> 03:32:31.774
I'm afraid we are tasked to see this to the end.

4653
03:32:31.929 --> 03:32:35.296
LIAM: And we are unsure
of the Assembly's intentions.

4654
03:32:35.296 --> 03:32:38.296
You should not be unsure about ours.

4655
03:32:40.020 --> 03:32:42.790
MARISHA: I think you want us there.

4656
03:32:42.790 --> 03:32:44.307
I really do.

4657
03:32:44.307 --> 03:32:47.727
TRAVIS: We have skin in
this game, so to speak.

4658
03:32:47.727 --> 03:32:50.733
We would not put your men
or women in a treacherous position

4659
03:32:50.733 --> 03:32:54.067
if we are right alongside them.

4660
03:32:54.067 --> 03:32:55.584
(Matt sighs)

4661
03:32:58.911 --> 03:33:01.071
MATT: Make a persuasion check, Beau.

4662
03:33:01.071 --> 03:33:02.636
SAM: Yep.

4663
03:33:02.636 --> 03:33:04.035
LIAM: Does she get an assist?

4664
03:33:04.035 --> 03:33:05.908
MATT: I'll say you get an assist from
Fjord on that, so you have advantage.

4665
03:33:05.908 --> 03:33:08.600
TRAVIS: I give you assist.
LIAM: Yeah.

4666
03:33:10.938 --> 03:33:13.168
MARISHA: Thank god for that assist.

4667
03:33:13.168 --> 03:33:14.309
18.
MATT: 18.

4668
03:33:14.309 --> 03:33:16.776
MARISHA: That was a natural one on the other one.

4669
03:33:19.300 --> 03:33:22.800
MATT: "I'll consider it. It is a strange request.

4670
03:33:25.433 --> 03:33:30.431
"I did not see you sellswords
and adventuring types

4671

"but if that is your prerogative."

4673
03:33:39.422 --> 03:33:40.721
MARISHA: It's not.

4674
03:33:40.721 --> 03:33:45.109
TRAVIS: We mean to lend an air of accountability.

4675
03:33:45.109 --> 03:33:48.702
MARISHA: Our objective is our own,
and always has been,

4676
03:33:48.702 --> 03:33:52.285
as Mr. Widogast has just previously stated.

4677
03:33:54.059 --> 03:33:57.724
LIAM: The soul of the Empire is at stake.

4678
03:33:57.724 --> 03:33:59.802
MARISHA: As is the soul of the Dynasty,

4679
03:33:59.802 --> 03:34:02.471
and perhaps the world at large.

4680
03:34:02.471 --> 03:34:05.352
We mentioned this when we spoke in the past.

4681
03:34:05.352 --> 03:34:07.019
Nothing has changed.

4682
03:34:08.005 --> 03:34:10.794
If anything, all of the
information that has gleamed

4683
03:34:10.794 --> 03:34:14.500
in the past several weeks
has proved what we tried

4684
03:34:14.500 --> 03:34:18.969
to warn months ago,
that this war was staged

4685
03:34:18.969 --> 03:34:20.986
by greater forces.

4686
03:34:23.442 --> 03:34:26.634
MATT: "Well, you certainly
surprise me, Mighty Nein.

4687
03:34:29.877 --> 03:34:31.718
"Very well.

"accommodating."

4691
03:34:42.829 --> 03:34:45.751
SAM: One more-- just one more detail.

4692
03:34:45.751 --> 03:34:49.753
Would you prefer a specific date,

4693
03:34:49.753 --> 03:34:53.620
or should we leave it vague
for security reasons for now?

4694
03:34:54.462 --> 03:34:56.544
MATT: "We have means of communicating,

4695

"once you've made this contact.

4696

"that ties the threads of this at the beginning.

"regardless of the circumstances."

03:35:21.573 --> 03:35:23.231
MATT: (as the Bright Queen) "Good.

4704
03:35:23.231 --> 03:35:25.756
"Notify us of the response from the Empire.

ASHLEY: I do have a question.

4710
03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:42.302
When do you plan on...

4711
03:35:45.283 --> 03:35:49.983
When is your prisoner
planned to be put on trial?

4712
03:35:51.224 --> 03:35:53.857
MATT: "None of this changes things.

"This individual that we have, this traitor,

"So for now, judgment is stayed."

maintain the ceasefire

4717

until these talks?

4718
03:36:20.899 --> 03:36:24.672
MATT: "As long as the
Empire does, of course.

MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.

TRAVIS: Of course.

We thank you for your patience.

MATT: She sits upon the throne,
and that powerful,

hard, driven persona that

4728
03:36:53.703 --> 03:36:55.269
you saw when you first arrived,

4729
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:58.545
and have seen since these escalations,

4730
03:36:58.545 --> 03:37:03.167
drops once more into a softer smile,

4731
03:37:03.167 --> 03:37:07.271
one reminiscent of when you
first delivered the beacon.

4732
03:37:07.271 --> 03:37:09.900
She sets the staff aside
and places the hands crossed

4733
03:37:09.900 --> 03:37:12.175
at the front of her knees.

"You are unique.

"Now go."

SAM: Yep, yep.

4737
03:37:26.467 --> 03:37:29.165
TRAVIS: Do you know how to
reanimate a dead weasel?

4738
03:37:29.165 --> 03:37:31.797
(laughter)

4739
03:37:31.797 --> 03:37:32.759
LAURA: Stop it!

4740
03:37:32.759 --> 03:37:34.599
SAM: Transfer its soul into another weasel.

4741
03:37:34.599 --> 03:37:36.391
(laughter)

4742
03:37:36.391 --> 03:37:37.804
TRAVIS: Give it life from your beacon.

4743
03:37:37.804 --> 03:37:41.411
MATT: Essek gives a kneel, turns.

4744
03:37:41.411 --> 03:37:43.620
SAM: We bow, we leave.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4745
03:37:43.620 --> 03:37:45.909
MATT: You guys make your
exit from the chamber

4746
03:37:45.909 --> 03:37:49.215
back into the center
of the Lucid Bastion.

4747
03:37:49.215 --> 03:37:52.157
Once you pass by the antechamber
doors, closing behind,

4748
03:37:52.157 --> 03:37:54.030
even Essek's like (exhales).

4749
03:37:54.030 --> 03:37:56.662
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
TALIESIN: That went really well.

4750
03:37:56.662 --> 03:37:59.117
LAURA: That actually went really well.

4751
03:37:59.117 --> 03:38:01.272
TALIESIN: Like, even by the
standard-- I mean like,

4752
03:38:01.272 --> 03:38:03.805
I know that we set the bar, like, a very--

4753
03:38:03.805 --> 03:38:06.495
I don't like saying it that often, but like, wow.

4754
03:38:06.495 --> 03:38:08.998
LAURA: We normally fuck things up pretty good.

4755
03:38:08.998 --> 03:38:11.226
TALIESIN: For, like, a normal bar, that was pretty good.

4756
03:38:11.226 --> 03:38:13.052
MARISHA: Thank you, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4757
03:38:13.052 --> 03:38:15.726
MARISHA: I had a good feeling
about you in this one.

4758
03:38:15.726 --> 03:38:19.316
I didn't want to say it ahead
of time in case I was wrong.

4759
03:38:19.316 --> 03:38:21.617
But I had a feeling that
you would be the one

4760
03:38:21.617 --> 03:38:23.970
to push us over the edge.

4761
03:38:23.970 --> 03:38:26.120
MATT: Essek just says,

4762
03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:28.603
"But let us all take
a moment to appreciate

4763
03:38:28.603 --> 03:38:32.393
"the contributions of everyone
brave enough in that room

4764
03:38:32.393 --> 03:38:34.733
"to step up before that
council and speak.

4765
03:38:34.733 --> 03:38:36.461
"I myself am still impressed
at what you managed

4766
03:38:36.461 --> 03:38:37.794
"to push forward.

4767
03:38:38.638 --> 03:38:41.101
"(exhales)

4768
03:38:41.101 --> 03:38:42.209
"Well."

4769
03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:45.869
LIAM: Thank you as well.

4770
03:38:45.869 --> 03:38:46.880
TALIESIN: I say we--

4771
03:38:46.880 --> 03:38:49.914
LIAM: We would not have
had as much sway here

4772
03:38:49.914 --> 03:38:52.192
without your assistance.

4773
03:38:52.192 --> 03:38:53.558
MATT: "Of course not.

4774
03:38:53.558 --> 03:38:56.741
"And strangely, neither would I.

4775
03:38:57.913 --> 03:38:58.746
"So.

4776
03:39:00.596 --> 03:39:05.596
"Do you need a lift back to your home?

4777
03:39:05.768 --> 03:39:06.967
SAM: A lift?

4778
03:39:08.407 --> 03:39:09.746
MATT: "To the Empire. You've--"

4779
03:39:09.746 --> 03:39:13.697
SAM: Oh, oh, oh, no, no, we
can do that, we're actually okay.

4780
03:39:13.697 --> 03:39:14.819
MATT: "Oh, all right.

4781
03:39:14.819 --> 03:39:17.200
"Sorry, I just assumed, It's been a--"

4782
03:39:17.200 --> 03:39:18.900
SAM: You've done so much for us.

4783
03:39:18.900 --> 03:39:20.622
TRAVIS: What were you saying, Caduceus?

4784
03:39:20.622 --> 03:39:24.776
TALIESIN: Well, Yasha's got some
shopping we should pick up

4785
03:39:24.776 --> 03:39:26.189
before we go.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4786
03:39:26.189 --> 03:39:27.142
LAURA: The bracers.

4787
03:39:27.142 --> 03:39:29.699
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what time is it?

4788
03:39:29.699 --> 03:39:30.979
SAM: We probably have to
get it tomorrow morning.

4789
03:39:30.979 --> 03:39:31.812
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4790
03:39:31.812 --> 03:39:33.468
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we'll
go sleep at the house,

4791
03:39:33.468 --> 03:39:35.308
and then we'll head back,
is that okay?

4792
03:39:35.308 --> 03:39:38.656
I can send a message along
that we've had talks,

4793
03:39:38.656 --> 03:39:43.057
and that, you know, we
will be arriving tomorrow.

4794
03:39:43.057 --> 03:39:45.553
MARISHA: We should do that
and reassure the ceasefire

4795
03:39:45.553 --> 03:39:48.185
and make sure that no
one attacks anybody.

4796
03:39:48.185 --> 03:39:49.135
LAURA: Yeah.

4797
03:39:49.135 --> 03:39:51.860
Who should I send a message to?

4798
03:39:51.860 --> 03:39:53.515
TRAVIS: Ludinus.
MARISHA: Probably Ludinus.

4799
03:39:53.515 --> 03:39:54.809
SAM: But not tonight.

4800
03:39:54.809 --> 03:39:56.730
LAURA: No no no, I should
send them a message tonight.

4801
03:39:56.730 --> 03:39:57.706
SAM: Really?

4802
03:39:57.706 --> 03:39:58.871
LIAM: Yeah, as soon as possible.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4803
03:39:58.871 --> 03:40:03.249
If anyone kills a Kryn soldier, we're fucked.

4804
03:40:03.249 --> 03:40:05.304
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right,
all right, all right.

4805
03:40:05.304 --> 03:40:06.761
MATT: "That is a good idea. Let him know--"

4806
03:40:06.761 --> 03:40:10.074
LAURA: Okay, while we're walking,
I'm going to send him a message.

4807
03:40:10.074 --> 03:40:11.004
SAM: Nope.

4808
03:40:12.238 --> 03:40:13.584
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4809
03:40:13.584 --> 03:40:15.724
TRAVIS: Wow.
(laughter)

4810
03:40:15.724 --> 03:40:19.340
LAURA: We just talked to the Bright Queen.

4811
03:40:19.340 --> 03:40:21.443
Things are looking good.

4812
03:40:21.443 --> 03:40:25.409
Maintain the ceasefire, super important.

4813
03:40:27.009 --> 03:40:30.092
Will be arriving tomorrow...

4814
03:40:30.092 --> 03:40:31.300
to talk.

4815
03:40:35.460 --> 03:40:37.867
MARISHA: Matt's impressed. (laughs)

4816
03:40:37.867 --> 03:40:38.965
LIAM: We all are.

4817
03:40:38.965 --> 03:40:40.408
(laughter)

4818
03:40:40.408 --> 03:40:43.516
LIAM: Efficient.
MATT: That was informative and concise.

4819
03:40:43.516 --> 03:40:44.579
(laughter)

4820
03:40:44.579 --> 03:40:46.108
TALIESIN: That was good, I
don't care if everything

4821
03:40:46.108 --> 03:40:49.263
goes to heck tomorrow,
today was good.

4822
03:40:49.263 --> 03:40:51.665
SAM: Because we rested yesterday,
because we went to the spa.

4823
03:40:51.665 --> 03:40:54.331
MATT: Response: "Ah, well done.

4824
03:40:54.331 --> 03:40:55.942
LAURA: Thank you.

4825
03:40:55.942 --> 03:40:58.480
MATT: "I assume we expect your arrival soon.

4826
03:40:58.480 --> 03:41:01.813
LAURA: Oh, I was just talking out
loud to him talking to me.

4827
03:41:03.514 --> 03:41:04.916
What'd he say?

4828
03:41:04.916 --> 03:41:06.442
(laughter)

4829
03:41:06.442 --> 03:41:08.178
TALIESIN: Well done, expect
your arrival soon.

4830
03:41:08.178 --> 03:41:11.381
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.
That's good, he said "well done!"

4831
03:41:11.381 --> 03:41:12.534
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4832
03:41:12.534 --> 03:41:14.484
SAM: Great. Good, yes.
TRAVIS: No fighting, right?

4833
03:41:14.484 --> 03:41:16.324
LAURA: I was, like, responding to a voicemail.

4834
03:41:16.324 --> 03:41:18.187
Oh thanks, shit, what'd he say?

4835
03:41:18.187 --> 03:41:19.396
(Matt chuckling)

4836
03:41:19.396 --> 03:41:21.825
MARISHA: Keep the ceasefire,
super important. Yeah.

4837
03:41:21.825 --> 03:41:23.551
TRAVIS: I was counting for it so I wasn't listening.

4838
03:41:23.551 --> 03:41:25.226
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

4839
03:41:25.226 --> 03:41:27.781
MATT: Essek breaks rank with
you to head towards his business.

4840
03:41:27.781 --> 03:41:31.128
You make your way back towards the Xhorhaus.

4841
03:41:31.128 --> 03:41:33.347
LAURA: Bye, Essek!

4842
03:41:33.347 --> 03:41:35.677
You can come by tonight and
get some dinner or something,

4843
03:41:35.677 --> 03:41:36.948
if you want to. We miss you.

4844
03:41:36.948 --> 03:41:38.848
SAM: We haven't done any shopping or anything.
LAURA: Yeah.

4845
03:41:38.848 --> 03:41:40.469
TALIESIN: It's pretty empty in there, I'm going to--

4846
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:43.711
MATT: "I appreciate the offer,
I have my own work

4847
03:41:43.711 --> 03:41:47.044
"and research to continue, but well done.

4848
03:41:48.090 --> 03:41:50.742
"Impressive work.

4849
03:41:50.742 --> 03:41:53.055
"Just hope it sticks."

4850
03:41:53.055 --> 03:41:54.555
And he drifts off.

4851
03:41:56.863 --> 03:41:57.984
MARISHA: Cool.

4852
03:41:57.984 --> 03:41:59.762
LAURA: I like him.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4853
03:41:59.762 --> 03:42:01.683
Wonder what work he has to do so late.

4854
03:42:01.683 --> 03:42:02.958
LAURA: I don't know, I don't know, I mean,

4855
03:42:02.958 --> 03:42:04.676
maybe he's got to go torture that guy some more.

4856
03:42:04.676 --> 03:42:05.901
MARISHA: That's true, yeah.

4857
03:42:05.901 --> 03:42:08.575
TALIESIN: Could have a second job, I mean, you know.

4858
03:42:08.575 --> 03:42:10.293
People have two jobs.

4859
03:42:10.293 --> 03:42:12.076
LAURA: Who knows what the
Shadowhand really does,

4860
03:42:12.076 --> 03:42:13.572
I mean, that's probably--

4861
03:42:13.572 --> 03:42:16.393
MATT: You guys have arrived at the
Xhorhaus by now, if you want to.

4862
03:42:16.393 --> 03:42:17.602
So you're in your private space.

4863
03:42:17.602 --> 03:42:20.526
MARISHA: Do you think he's a family man?
Think he has kids?

4864
03:42:20.526 --> 03:42:23.090
SAM: Have we ever asked him about himself?

4865
03:42:23.090 --> 03:42:24.924
LAURA: We don't know anything about Essek.

4866
03:42:24.924 --> 03:42:26.022
Have we been to his house?

4867
03:42:26.022 --> 03:42:27.643
LIAM: What's his mother's name?

4868
03:42:27.643 --> 03:42:30.337
LAURA: What's his mother's name?!
SAM: That's a stupid question, nobody knows that.

4869
03:42:30.337 --> 03:42:34.399
ASHLEY: Does he have a significant
other or anything like that?

4870
03:42:34.399 --> 03:42:36.804
LAURA: I don't know.
MARISHA: I feel like we've tried.

4871
03:42:36.804 --> 03:42:38.284
SAM: I think we asked if he was single.

4872
03:42:38.284 --> 03:42:41.700
MARISHA: Yeah, and he was like
ooh, I'm aloof, I'm Essek.

4873
03:42:41.700 --> 03:42:44.562
LAURA: Should I call him and ask him?

4874
03:42:44.562 --> 03:42:47.638
TRAVIS: Yes, you should send
him a message right now,

4875
03:42:47.638 --> 03:42:49.023
he hasn't even gotten that far.

4876
03:42:49.023 --> 03:42:51.463
ASHLEY: See if he was lying about working.

4877
03:42:51.463 --> 03:42:52.876
If he just actually had to--

4878
03:42:52.876 --> 03:42:55.198
LAURA: Go.
TRAVIS: Jester, you know you have to do it.

4879
03:42:55.198 --> 03:42:56.414
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send him a message.

4880
03:42:56.414 --> 03:42:57.876
MARISHA: Just say--
MATT: Okay.

4881
03:42:57.876 --> 03:43:00.506
MARISHA: a/s/l?
LIAM: Destiny.

4882
03:43:00.506 --> 03:43:02.150
LAURA: Essek.

4883
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:04.598
We don't know anything about
you, we just realized.

4884
03:43:04.598 --> 03:43:06.830
We should really hang out more.

4885
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:07.887
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

4886
03:43:07.887 --> 03:43:09.456
LAURA: Are you single?

4887
03:43:09.456 --> 03:43:11.281
Do you have kids?

4888
03:43:12.556 --> 03:43:13.717
TALIESIN: Swipe right.

4889
03:43:13.717 --> 03:43:15.279
LAURA: Swipe right?

4890
03:43:15.279 --> 03:43:16.854
Also,

4891
03:43:16.854 --> 03:43:17.912
mom's name?

4892
03:43:17.912 --> 03:43:22.533
(laughter)

4893
03:43:22.533 --> 03:43:24.481
SAM: Social security number?

4894
03:43:24.481 --> 03:43:26.330
MATT: (laughs)

4895
03:43:26.330 --> 03:43:27.455
TALIESIN: Vegan?

4896
03:43:29.316 --> 03:43:31.016
MATT: "That was quick.

4897
03:43:33.257 --> 03:43:36.922
"I'm not particularly interesting.

4898
03:43:36.922 --> 03:43:40.273
"Don't like to talk about myself.

4899
03:43:40.273 --> 03:43:41.640
"Don't worry.

4900
03:43:43.144 --> 03:43:44.806
"Just happy to be around."

4901
03:43:44.806 --> 03:43:46.548
TALIESIN: Cat person.
MARISHA: Mm.

4902
03:43:46.548 --> 03:43:47.872
SAM: (laughs)

4903
03:43:47.872 --> 03:43:49.829
LAURA: He's shy.

4904
03:43:49.829 --> 03:43:52.627
He says he's not very interesting,
but we know that's a lie.

4905
03:43:52.627 --> 03:43:54.585
ASHLEY: Yeah, anybody who says that is--

4906
03:43:54.585 --> 03:43:56.535
LAURA: Is super interesting.

4907
03:43:58.180 --> 03:44:00.434
Hmm.

4908
03:44:00.434 --> 03:44:03.267
Didn't answer my questions at all.

4909
03:44:04.765 --> 03:44:07.129
MARISHA: So what are we supposed to do tonight?

4910
03:44:07.129 --> 03:44:10.907
Night in Xhorhas, Xhorhaus, Xhorhas.

4911
03:44:10.907 --> 03:44:12.198
TALIESIN: Pictionary.

4912
03:44:12.198 --> 03:44:14.919
MARISHA: Xhorhaus is your house.

4913
03:44:14.919 --> 03:44:16.132
LAURA: Hey, Yasha?

4914
03:44:16.132 --> 03:44:17.910
ASHLEY: Yeah?

4915
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:20.493
LAURA: You're definitely redeemable.

4916
03:44:22.277 --> 03:44:24.678
ASHLEY: Thank you, Jester.

4917
03:44:24.678 --> 03:44:26.387
I think so.

4918
03:44:28.663 --> 03:44:31.671
But I don't know, you just never know for sure.

4919
03:44:31.671 --> 03:44:34.908
LAURA: Anybody who plays harp as good as you.

4920
03:44:34.908 --> 03:44:36.540
(clicks tongue)

4921
03:44:36.540 --> 03:44:39.541
ASHLEY: Well, that was
just one time. We'll see.

4922
03:44:39.541 --> 03:44:41.629
I'm going to try to get better, though.

4923
03:44:41.629 --> 03:44:44.916
MARISHA: That's a good point,
we haven't heard the bone harp

4924
03:44:44.916 --> 03:44:47.566
and the bone flute together.

4925
03:44:47.566 --> 03:44:48.692
TRAVIS: Oh god.

4926
03:44:48.692 --> 03:44:50.521
ASHLEY: Should we give it a go?
TALIESIN: I mean, we can.

4927
03:44:50.521 --> 03:44:52.394
MARISHA: Maybe, you know, we can make a cocktail,

4928
03:44:52.394 --> 03:44:56.272
do a little like, you guys do a little jam sesh for us.

4929
03:44:56.272 --> 03:44:58.607
LAURA: I'm going to keep Spiritual Weapon up.

4930
03:44:58.607 --> 03:44:59.899
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

4931
03:44:59.899 --> 03:45:03.175
We could practice, you know, for your entrance.

4932
03:45:03.175 --> 03:45:04.379
LAURA: Yeah.

4933
03:45:04.379 --> 03:45:05.944
ASHLEY: I'm going to put a fire on.

4934
03:45:05.944 --> 03:45:08.552
MARISHA: I'm going to go get the booze!

4935
03:45:08.552 --> 03:45:10.723
LIAM: Summoning Frumpkin.

4936
03:45:10.723 --> 03:45:11.828
MATT: Okay.

4937
03:45:11.828 --> 03:45:13.679
SAM: I'll go over to Caleb.

4938
03:45:13.679 --> 03:45:17.779
Caleb, before we hear this delightful music,

4939
03:45:17.779 --> 03:45:20.946
which I'm sure is going to be amazing.

4940
03:45:23.244 --> 03:45:26.577
Essek seemed okay with you today, right?

4941
03:45:30.397 --> 03:45:32.000
LIAM: I don't know.

4942
03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:33.673
LAURA: Are you guys hugging as
you're having this conversation?

4943
03:45:33.673 --> 03:45:35.909
SAM: We're in private and we're spooning.

4944
03:45:35.909 --> 03:45:37.520
LIAM: Our legs are in the air.

4945
03:45:37.520 --> 03:45:38.353
(laughter)

4946
03:45:38.353 --> 03:45:39.636
MATT: God dammit.

4947
03:45:42.050 --> 03:45:45.017
SAM: Yeah, our anuses are focused on the sun.

4948
03:45:45.988 --> 03:45:47.872
LIAM: There's no sun here. We can't do it.

4949
03:45:47.872 --> 03:45:49.401
MARISHA: That's true.

4950
03:45:49.401 --> 03:45:51.536
SAM: So this SPF is useless.
LAURA: Moon charge.

4951
03:45:51.536 --> 03:45:53.574
TRAVIS: It's all UVB.

4952
03:45:53.574 --> 03:45:55.922
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Create Undead on the weasel.

4953
03:45:55.922 --> 03:45:58.198
LIAM: We're moon mooning.

4954
03:45:58.198 --> 03:45:59.206
MATT: Shh.

4955
03:46:03.511 --> 03:46:05.643
SAM: It's been a while since we've seen Essek,

4956
03:46:05.643 --> 03:46:07.234
and so I don't know.
LIAM: Yeah.

4957
03:46:07.234 --> 03:46:10.598
SAM: Just seemed a little funky back there.

4958
03:46:10.598 --> 03:46:13.801
LIAM: Yeah, maybe I caught
a whiff of that as well,

4959
03:46:13.801 --> 03:46:17.263
but I don't know what
is bringing it about.

4960
03:46:17.263 --> 03:46:18.959
We owe him favors.

4961
03:46:18.959 --> 03:46:20.493
SAM: We owe him everything.

4962
03:46:20.493 --> 03:46:22.410
LIAM: And he has not asked.

4963
03:46:24.221 --> 03:46:25.596
Worth it, though.

4964
03:46:25.596 --> 03:46:28.329
SAM: What do you think-- I have--

4965
03:46:29.462 --> 03:46:31.687
I'm a little bit worried.

4966
03:46:31.687 --> 03:46:32.787
LIAM: Tell me.

4967
03:46:35.233 --> 03:46:37.171
SAM: Something in the way he was behaving

4968
03:46:37.171 --> 03:46:41.038
when we were at that prison was funny to me.

4969
03:46:42.793 --> 03:46:45.828
Do you think it would be a terrible idea,

4970
03:46:45.828 --> 03:46:49.639
because many of my ideas are, if I asked Jester

4971
03:46:49.639 --> 03:46:51.722
to scry on that prisoner?

4972
03:46:55.153 --> 03:47:00.153
LIAM: Well, the prison is pretty well guarded

4973
03:47:00.346 --> 03:47:04.381
from that sort of thing, and if it weren't,

4974
03:47:04.381 --> 03:47:06.298
I would agree with you.

4975
03:47:10.018 --> 03:47:11.991
I want to be wrong so badly,

4976
03:47:11.991 --> 03:47:14.020
I think I'm just still paranoid,

4977
03:47:14.020 --> 03:47:18.562
but I have not let my guard
down entirely for him.

4978
03:47:20.301 --> 03:47:24.056
But maybe we are assholes, so.

4979
03:47:24.056 --> 03:47:25.608
SAM: That is true.

4980
03:47:25.608 --> 03:47:27.243
Tanned assholes.

4981
03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:31.206
LIAM: Not in these climes.

4982
03:47:31.206 --> 03:47:34.984
SAM: You were amazing back there, by the way.

4983
03:47:34.984 --> 03:47:39.664
It occurs to me that you've
walked into that palace,

4984
03:47:39.664 --> 03:47:42.168
that throne room twice
now and offered them

4985
03:47:42.168 --> 03:47:45.652
a beacon or the promise of a beacon.

4986
03:47:45.652 --> 03:47:49.339
They must think you are fucking god.

4987
03:47:49.339 --> 03:47:51.786
LIAM: She did not look that impressed
with me, to be honest.

4988
03:47:51.786 --> 03:47:53.828
SAM: She looked pretty impressed.

4989
03:47:56.025 --> 03:47:57.525
I was impressed.

4990
03:47:59.310 --> 03:48:01.777
LIAM: I hope we are doing the right thing.

4991
03:48:03.316 --> 03:48:04.865
I hope this--

4992
03:48:06.965 --> 03:48:09.256
this is our biggest con ever.

4993
03:48:10.158 --> 03:48:11.741
I hope it pans out.

4994
03:48:13.596 --> 03:48:14.629
SAM: Oh yeah.

4995
03:48:16.016 --> 03:48:17.349
LIAM: A lot of risk.

4996
03:48:18.429 --> 03:48:21.875
SAM: Well, do you have any cotton?

4997
03:48:21.875 --> 03:48:23.466
LIAM: I do.

4998
03:48:23.466 --> 03:48:25.177
SAM: Can you shove some in my ears?

4999
03:48:25.177 --> 03:48:27.878
MARISHA: Shots, shots, shots, get ready for this.

5000
03:48:27.878 --> 03:48:29.861
(Matt laughing)
Shots. Shots, shots.

5001
03:48:29.861 --> 03:48:31.383
TRAVIS: What even is this?

5002
03:48:31.383 --> 03:48:33.130
MARISHA: It's-- I found it under the sink.

5003
03:48:33.130 --> 03:48:34.630
LAURA: This is cleaner.

5004
03:48:36.931 --> 03:48:39.061
SAM: All right, let's hear it.

5005
03:48:39.061 --> 03:48:41.019
LAURA: Spiritual Weapon!

5006
03:48:42.644 --> 03:48:44.816
(crappy beatboxing)

5007
03:48:44.816 --> 03:48:46.762
(laughter)

5008
03:48:46.762 --> 03:48:50.205
(Sam vocalizing)

5009
03:48:50.205 --> 03:48:52.360
(Travis vocalizing)

5010
03:48:52.360 --> 03:48:54.028
(Laura vocalizing)

5011
03:48:54.028 --> 03:48:59.028
(Taliesin shouting)
(laughter)

5012
03:48:59.260 --> 03:49:02.400
(Liam cat yowling)

5013
03:49:02.400 --> 03:49:03.939
TALIESIN: Is this all, by the way,
that it can do?

5014
03:49:03.939 --> 03:49:04.772
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay.

5015
03:49:04.772 --> 03:49:07.722
MATT: Well no, it is a flute
in the sense that it has--

5016
03:49:07.722 --> 03:49:09.284
there are means you're learning

5017
03:49:09.284 --> 03:49:10.987
as you're finding it,
there are certain places

5018
03:49:10.987 --> 03:49:12.590
where you can change the key, but the sound

5019
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:13.702
is pretty consistent.

5020
03:49:13.702 --> 03:49:16.753
TALIESIN: Always going to be a scream.
MATT: Yeah.

5021
03:49:16.753 --> 03:49:19.912
It's screams of different tonalities.

5022
03:49:19.912 --> 03:49:23.974
(Taliesin shouting)
(laughter)

5023
03:49:23.974 --> 03:49:25.269
I'd like you all to make
performance checks, please.

5024
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:26.263
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5025
03:49:26.263 --> 03:49:27.401
(Matt laughing)

5026
03:49:27.401 --> 03:49:30.352
LIAM: Poor Frumpkin is meowing really loud.

5027
03:49:30.352 --> 03:49:32.244
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Cat howling.

5028
03:49:32.244 --> 03:49:34.666
LAURA: Oh, no. (laughing)

5029
03:49:34.666 --> 03:49:36.591
What'd you roll?

5030
03:49:36.591 --> 03:49:38.008
MATT: What'd you get?
TALIESIN: 10.

5031
03:49:38.008 --> 03:49:39.312
LAURA: Five.

5032
03:49:39.312 --> 03:49:40.145
ASHLEY: 12.

5033
03:49:40.145 --> 03:49:41.547
(laughter)

5034
03:49:41.547 --> 03:49:43.029
LIAM: Frumpkin got a 13.

5035
03:49:44.171 --> 03:49:45.654
MATT: This is, um...

5036
03:49:48.171 --> 03:49:49.814
(sighs)

5037
03:49:49.814 --> 03:49:52.267
Back when we were young.

5038
03:49:52.267 --> 03:49:53.560
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

5039
03:49:53.560 --> 03:49:54.983
MATT: They don't do this
anymore, I don't think,

5040
03:49:54.983 --> 03:49:57.628
but every now and then, there
would be, like, a day of school

5041
03:49:57.628 --> 03:50:00.729
in elementary school where
they would pass out recorders.

5042
03:50:00.729 --> 03:50:03.586
TALIESIN: Yep.
(laughter)

5043
03:50:03.586 --> 03:50:05.886
MATT: And that first moment
any kid in that class

5044
03:50:05.886 --> 03:50:09.336
got a recorder, it was
about 30 seconds of

5045
03:50:09.336 --> 03:50:11.223
(shrieking)

5046
03:50:11.223 --> 03:50:13.947
before the teacher had
to shut everyone up.

5047
03:50:13.947 --> 03:50:15.949
This is a grand orchestra of that.

5048
03:50:15.949 --> 03:50:17.115
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

5049
03:50:17.115 --> 03:50:19.189
MATT: Echoing throughout the Xhorhaus,

5050
03:50:19.189 --> 03:50:21.918
peacefully quiet, dark and empty

5051
03:50:21.918 --> 03:50:23.424
in this little nestled neighborhood

5052
03:50:23.424 --> 03:50:26.802
in the Gallimaufry district of Rosohna,

5053
03:50:26.802 --> 03:50:28.801
as we pull back through the windows

5054
03:50:28.801 --> 03:50:32.451
of the interior soft glow, the lit tree

5055
03:50:32.451 --> 03:50:35.225
that looms over the house above the entirety

5056
03:50:35.225 --> 03:50:39.018
of the neighborhood, the epic, muffled,

5057
03:50:39.018 --> 03:50:42.696
but ever-grating sound of cacophonous,

5058
03:50:42.696 --> 03:50:45.382
can't even really call it music,

5059
03:50:45.382 --> 03:50:48.907
emanating through the streets
as neighbors walk through

5060
03:50:48.907 --> 03:50:50.740
the night road, going--

5061
03:50:52.943 --> 03:50:54.256
LIAM: It's like "The Burbs."
LAURA: Yeah.

5062
03:50:54.256 --> 03:50:55.477
(laughter)

5063
03:50:55.477 --> 03:50:57.534
MATT: And that's where we're
going to end tonight's episode.

5064
03:50:57.534 --> 03:50:59.762
(cheering)

5065
03:50:59.762 --> 03:51:02.619
LIAM: That's when the music teacher
brings out his special thermos.

5066
03:51:02.619 --> 03:51:04.371
MATT: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

5067
03:51:04.371 --> 03:51:05.726
(laughter)

5068
03:51:05.726 --> 03:51:08.948
TRAVIS: His special thermos, yeah.

5069
03:51:08.948 --> 03:51:11.458
MATT: We're back. Happy 2020. We missed you guys,

5070
03:51:11.458 --> 03:51:13.204
missed you guys.

5071
03:51:13.204 --> 03:51:16.201
We're going to pick this up next Thursday.

5072
03:51:16.201 --> 03:51:17.034
LAURA: Yay!

5073
03:51:17.034 --> 03:51:19.469
TRAVIS: I think I burned about
400 calories when Sam said

5074
03:51:19.469 --> 03:51:21.858
that Sprinkle was dead.

5075
03:51:21.858 --> 03:51:23.538
(laughter)

5076
03:51:23.538 --> 03:51:25.357
Been dead for four weeks.

5077
03:51:25.357 --> 03:51:27.369
(as Jester) Eat it, eat it!

5078
03:51:27.369 --> 03:51:31.962
(laughter)

5079
03:51:31.962 --> 03:51:33.417
MARISHA: Just stiff.

5080
03:51:33.417 --> 03:51:35.194
LIAM: We're going to meet the Tal'Dorei Council

5081
03:51:35.194 --> 03:51:36.787
and Jester's going to step forward and say,

5082
03:51:36.787 --> 03:51:39.774
"I have brought you a most special arrow."

5083
03:51:39.774 --> 03:51:42.072
(laughter)

5084
03:51:42.072 --> 03:51:43.656
TRAVIS: A boomerang.

5085
03:51:46.388 --> 03:51:47.773
Holy shit.

5086
03:51:47.773 --> 03:51:49.760
Something in my brain cracked.

5087
03:51:49.760 --> 03:51:50.593
MATT: Yep.

5088
03:51:50.593 --> 03:51:52.289
Yours and Taliesin's.

5089
03:51:52.289 --> 03:51:53.666
TALIESIN: I was not okay.

5090
03:51:53.666 --> 03:51:55.691
MATT: I haven't seen you break on
camera like that in a long time.

5091
03:51:55.691 --> 03:51:57.814
TALIESIN: I can't remember the last time
I broke on camera like that.

5092
03:51:57.814 --> 03:51:59.305
MATT: Yeah, aw.

5093
03:51:59.305 --> 03:52:00.362
TALIESIN: Oh.

5094
03:52:00.362 --> 03:52:01.816
That was rough.

5095
03:52:01.816 --> 03:52:03.461
TRAVIS: I couldn't shake it for a while.

5096
03:52:03.461 --> 03:52:04.892
MATT: Oh my god.

5097
03:52:04.892 --> 03:52:07.752
Well, we love you guys very much,

5098
03:52:07.752 --> 03:52:09.185
have a wonderful week,

5099
03:52:09.185 --> 03:52:11.071
and is it Thursday yet?

5100
03:52:11.071 --> 03:52:12.137

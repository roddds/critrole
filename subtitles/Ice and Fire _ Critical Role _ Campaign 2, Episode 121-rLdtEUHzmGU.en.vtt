00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.203
MATT: Hello everybody,

00:00:01.203 --> 00:00:02.885
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:04.220
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.917
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:08.690
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.258
MATT: Just like that.

00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:11.890
Before we get into tonight's game,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.270
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.940
beginning with our sponsor for this evening's episode,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.773
Grim Hollow.

00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:17.650
Sam?

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.500
SAM: It's the first sponsor of 2021, everybody,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.870
and I am so optimistic for this year.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.660
The show, the sponsors, the ads,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.920
the fun we're going to have.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.700
And I'm going to set the tone tonight with this sponsor.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.610
This episode is sponsored by Grim Hollow!

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.060
LAURA: Your voice is so high!

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.878
SAM: Because I'm optimistic!

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:39.980
(laughter)

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.510
SAM: A dark fantasy setting in the godless war-torn world

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.441
filled with curses, plagues, and ghoulish creatures.

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:48.872
(laughter)

00:00:48.872 --> 00:00:51.218
SAM: But, like, fun ones, yeah!

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:53.960
Okay, Ghostfire Games' brand new Player's Guide

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.920
provides tools for players and GMs

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.850
to bring this awesome genre to life

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.510
in a civilization that's long forgotten hope!

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.039
(despondent) And now clings on desperately for survival.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.540
(laughter)

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.300
Speaking of clinging on!

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.091
How 'bout this balloon, huh?

00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:08.924
I love it!

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:10.580
Ooh, it's not popping!

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.413
(balloon pops)
Oh!

00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:14.620
(laughter)

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.060
It popped.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.530
This book includes rules for playing lycanthropes,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.690
vampires, liches, and fiends,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.370
powerful spells that slowly impact

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.190
the cursed creature over time,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.180
and mechanics for role-play progression

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.830
and say, an inquisitor, a merchant, physician,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.860
where you rise through the ranks of your profession

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.433
with bonuses on the way.

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:34.728
Physician?

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:37.451
What a great job to have in 2021!

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:39.521
(laughter)

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:40.560
Huh?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.020
Almost as fun as the fun we have here on Critical Role!

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.660
Where everything in '21, 2021's going to fill our body--

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.360
bellies with love, just like this kitten picture,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.528
right, guys?

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.732
(picture ripping)
I love it!

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:53.665
(laughter)

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:56.079
I fucking love it!
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.600
(laughter)

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.600
SAM: You can check it out now at bit.ly/crgrimhollow.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.807

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.520
Thanks to Ghostfire Games for starting 2021 off

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.760
on a cheerful, hopeful note.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.662
Almost as comforting as this cute little teddy bear!

00:02:19.662 --> 00:02:21.599
I just--
TRAVIS: Whoa!

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.491
MATT: Sam, Sam, Sam, no! Oh, no!

00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:26.995
(yelling)
SAM: (crazed laughter)

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:28.710
(calmly) Back to you, Matt.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.170
MATT: Wow, cathartic.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.210
Thank you, Grim Hollow, for giving Sam an outlet

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.183
that he obviously needed badly.

00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:36.740
LAURA: Going good.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.065
MATT: Yeah, brush it off a little bit.

00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:39.894
You're a little--
LIAM: A little fuzzed up there.

00:02:39.894 --> 00:02:41.658
MATT: There you go, there you go.
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:02:41.658 --> 00:02:43.341
LIAM: Perfect. (chicken bawk)

00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:45.341
MATT: Perfect, all right.
MARISHA: Its life force.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.700
MATT: In case you missed it,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.220
we actually released
Doom Eternal: Assault on Armaros Station,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.960
a 45-page interactive PDF

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.010
that provides game masters with a fifth edition-compatible

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.972
adventure themed to our very own Doom Eternal one-shot

00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:04.790
that we did earlier in 2020.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.640
If you haven't checked it out,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.113
and you want to play in a game like this,

00:03:08.113 --> 00:03:09.750
there might be spoilers, so maybe don't yet,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.055
play it first and then watch.

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:13.410
But if you did watch it, there's a few changes

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.780
and shifts and fun things in there to keep it fresh.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.890
The download does include fully-created character sheets

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.060
as well as monster stats, interactive and clickable maps,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.690
and usable audio files with a few familiar voices in there.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.810
This is all based on the module

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.560
that I created for the one-shot,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.940
but this was written by myself and our very own Chris Lockey

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.800
and was developed by Ivan van Norman

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.510
of our Darrington Press branch.
(cheering)

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.140
MATT: So you can find and purchase

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.250
Doom Eternal: Assault on Armaros Station

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.320
from the Crit Role US store at shop.critrole.com.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.661
LAURA: Mancubus!
MATT: I know!

00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.160
(laughter)

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.871
MATT: Most adorable demonic entity.

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:53.747
Laura, you had some things you wanted to talk about.

00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:55.240
LAURA: Oh, I did, I did!

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.010
So our Fjord and Beau statues that we talked about

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.010
with Sideshow are available for pre-order right this minute.

00:04:05.017 --> 00:04:07.010
And they might've been available earlier today,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.435
I don't know, but right now they are available.

00:04:09.435 --> 00:04:11.330
(laughter)

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.320
Did you...?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.763
TRAVIS: No, look, he's got a low dex mod. It's cool.

00:04:14.763 --> 00:04:16.610
(laughter)

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.928
LAURA: They're beautiful. Look at them, they're lovely.

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:23.866
They're available right now at side.show/criticalrole.

00:04:23.866 --> 00:04:25.499
They're available right now at side.show/criticalrole.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.287
And also, I have another thing to tell you guys.

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:31.979
We launched a store in Canada!

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.720
(cheering)

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.020
MARISHA: Yay!
LAURA: Yeah!

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.250
So anybody in our lovely neighboring country

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.600
can buy things and not have to worry about, you know,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.600
US shipping fees or whatever crazy (stutters) stuff.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.700
So yeah, there's a bunch of merch in there.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.533
It's ready to go.

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:52.646
You can go to look at it at canada.critrole.com.

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:54.970
You can go to look at it at canada.critrole.com.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.339
SAM: Not "Sorry, Quebec" this time.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.800
LAURA: Aww.
MARISHA: You're fucking welcome, Quebec!

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.120
(laughter)

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.771
MARISHA: Don't say we never did anything nice for you.

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:06.204
(laughter)

00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:08.549
MATT: All right, thank you.

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:10.369
Wonderful transition.
MARISHA: I love you.

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:11.550
MATT: Love you too.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.110
I think that is all of our announcements.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.925
So--
TRAVIS: Jesus.

00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:18.050
MATT: Without further ado, let's go ahead

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.589
and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.769
(growling)

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:26.818
(water bubbling)

00:05:26.818 --> 00:05:28.801
(thunder rumbling)

MATT: And welcome back.

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:06.920
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein making their way

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.290
through Eiselcross--
ALL: ♪ Making my way ♪

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.000
MATT: I'm waiting for it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.150
I was waiting for it.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.170
Had managed to hit up two

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.220
of the satellite Aeorian ruin segments,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.010
the excavation sites of small pieces

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.840
that had fallen from the ruined city

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.020
before it collided with Foren itself.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.020
After exiting the last one with a massive threshold crest

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.913
in your, I guess, collective hands,

00:07:36.913 --> 00:07:38.529
but more so in yours,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.210
you managed to escape the depths of this ruin.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.830
You brought forth a, I wouldn't say a new friend, per se,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.580
but the survivor of a previous expedition, Iver,

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.080
who oddly found reason to quickly mistrust you.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.800
And you kept him along with you for safekeeping

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.210
and journeyed for an hour beyond the ruin

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.870
to rest for the night.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.680
Before your night's rest could complete,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.210
Caduceus found that you had been found yourselves

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.600
by the Tomb Takers,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.080
who had been aware that you had beat them

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.760
to the A2 ruin and taken what seemed to have been

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.450
their quarry and reason for traveling there.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.523
So instead they beelined it to you to have a conversation.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.360
Through some odd trickery,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.130
Lucien dispelled your protective dome.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.850
And as you all sat there gathering yourselves in the snow,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.763
a brief conversation to led you agreeing to travel together.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.530
Perhaps along this journey, share some information,

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.490
perhaps align some of the interests that you carry

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.100
and perhaps find a way for them to acquire

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.600
what it is they need from you.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.143
And so, picking up where we left off,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.280
you all sit amongst the snow,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.570
gathering your things as the Tomb Takers

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.470
and Lucien begin to make their trek

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.740
towards the actual central ruin of Aeor.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.670
It's only but a fraction of time past morning light.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.900
Do you wish to try and continue your rest

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.150
for a full night's sleep?

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.590
SAM: Would that work?

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.172
TRAVIS: It'd probably be smart, right?

00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:29.390
LAURA: I mean--
TALIESIN: I would.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.230
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.063
LAURA: Yeah.

00:09:31.063 --> 00:09:32.018
MARISHA: I mean, but--
TRAVIS: I can stay--

00:09:32.018 --> 00:09:34.210
I can stay up and wake you bitches up

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.230
if something goes wrong.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.730
LAURA: But, like, are-- is Lucien still sitting right there?

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.976
MATT: Yeah.

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:43.500
LAURA: I'll just peek up my head up over the snow,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.500
and say: Lucien, I heard you. You guys didn't sleep either.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.253
Don't you need to rest?

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.758
MATT: "Well, I mean, I'm certain we're going to

00:09:53.758 --> 00:09:56.020
"be traveling together for a few days.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:01.020
"I think rest will have to be taken at some point, yes?"

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.520
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "There's trust."

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.050
LAURA: Yeah, so lay down, go to sleep.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.528
MATT: "Oh, I think we're--"
LAURA: Get some rest.

00:10:08.528 --> 00:10:11.800
MATT: "I think we're fine for the
better part of the coming day.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.810
"Right, friends?"

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.350
And the rest of the Tomb Takers, all still eyes wide,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.200
looking a little bleary-eyed but nod.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.180
"Right.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.910
"So, unless you're dragging ass behind

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.610
"and would like to make this deal now,

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.260
"we could begin our day's journey."

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.015
TALIESIN: We we'd like a minute more.

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:36.840
We did crawl through an underground ruin

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.640
and fight off a bunch of stuff.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.340
It would be nice to take a minute.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.050
MATT: "Take a minute, if you like."

00:10:44.818 --> 00:10:45.720
He takes a small toothpick out

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.930
and starts like picking it his teeth and just walks away

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.930
in a circle, looking around the environment.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.990
Caleb, at this point, you notice,

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.053
it wasn't just the dome that vanished.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.330
The contents of your amber also scattered

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.408
open to the ground around you under the snow.

00:11:01.408 --> 00:11:02.742
LAURA: That amber was in the bag,

00:11:02.742 --> 00:11:03.937
the whole night.
MATT: Oh, but you have it.

00:11:03.937 --> 00:11:05.857
Oh, interesting.
LAURA: Yeah, we did that.

00:11:05.857 --> 00:11:08.670
MARISHA: We double-wrapped it for freshness.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.860
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: For fresh.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.390
MATT: I've got an interesting question, then.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.637
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:11:12.637 --> 00:11:13.810
SAM: Oh no.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.901
TRAVIS: ♪ Here comes Vess DeRogna. ♪

00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:19.001
♪ Out of the bag! ♪
(laughter)

00:11:19.001 --> 00:11:20.337
LIAM: We just can't keep her in there.

00:11:20.337 --> 00:11:21.685
MARISHA: Just up, like--
TRAVIS: (thudding sounds)

00:11:21.685 --> 00:11:23.017
Oh!

00:11:23.017 --> 00:11:24.365
(laughter)

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:26.620
TALIESIN: Oh, that would be amusing.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.594
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: It seems like a

00:11:27.594 --> 00:11:30.094
10th-level dispel something something.

00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:33.475
MATT: Hmm.

00:11:33.475 --> 00:11:35.430
LAURA: Hmm.
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.829
MATT: That's all right.

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:39.300
LAURA: We learned our lesson on
the last time with the amber,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.325
hence the reason for the bag.
TRAVIS: Well, maybe we'll learn

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:42.458
what the scope of--
MATT: Of course.

00:11:42.458 --> 00:11:43.766
TRAVIS: -- this is, at least.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:47.893
TALIESIN: I wonder if it's unretrievable now?

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.300
MATT: No, okay. So actually, no,
because you hid it properly,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.430
so it didn't-- nothing happened.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.660
LAURA: Whew!
MATT: You're fine, you're fine.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.650
TRAVIS: Here, high five.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.080
MATT: I'd forgotten you had put it in the Bag of Holding.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.163
SAM: So--
TRAVIS: Good thinking.

00:11:57.163 --> 00:12:00.390
SAM: So the thing that we got in the amber in the bag?

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.465
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Okay.

00:12:01.465 --> 00:12:03.384
MARISHA: ♪ In a bucket in the bottom of the sea ♪

00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:05.760
(laughter)

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.680
SAM: Cool.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.919
We're smart.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:09.960
LAURA: We're so smart.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.000
SAM: We always do the right thing. (laughs)

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.275
LIAM: By the way, can I just point out: What a difference.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:15.827
This photo is from 2019,

00:12:15.827 --> 00:12:18.030
and this is 2020. Man.
(laughter)

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.095
MATT: How it started and how it ended.

00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:23.787
LIAM: This is after 2020.
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.102
TRAVIS: Can you lean to your right. Sam?

00:12:26.102 --> 00:12:29.211
Just for, oh, wow, that is--

00:12:29.211 --> 00:12:30.778
ASHLEY: Lemme give it a look see?

00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:32.300
LAURA: You look like a little baby.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.200
MATT: That man is never going to give you up,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.354
he's never going to let you down.

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:36.810
(laughter)

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.790
Never going to run around--

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.569
TRAVIS: And desert you.
(laughter)

00:12:40.569 --> 00:12:42.457
TRAVIS: Oh, man.
ASHLEY: Or desert you.

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:45.211
MATT: Yeah, yeah? I love it.

00:12:45.211 --> 00:12:47.910
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, we should finish our rest.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.360
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's finish the rest.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.203
Let's not be tired.
LAURA: We're going to try to do that.

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:54.180
MARISHA: I have a feeling-- I'm going to speak very quietly.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.660
TRAVIS: It's like two hours, right?

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.220
MARISHA: I have a feeling he's not
going to allow us to do that

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.480
unless, I don't know, we stall or something.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.140
TALIESIN: I'm staying up anyway, so--

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.950
because I don't have to sleep from the end of my long rest.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.020
I just have to chill.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.760
MARISHA: He's being very bitchy and he wants us to go now.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.980
ASHLEY: Is--
SAM: Well, I mean,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.440
he's not all bad. He has good oral hygiene, you know?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.840
He's taking care of his teeth.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.050
ASHLEY: Dagen is still--

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.369
MATT: Dagen, you don't see anywhere.

00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:25.993
SAM: That's right.
LAURA: That's good.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.880
SAM: So I guess some of you guys
are just going to go to sleep

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.022
here in the snow and we'll just stand guard?

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:37.060
LAURA: I like the cold.
TRAVIS: Yes, sleep.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.093
SAM: All right.
LIAM: We do an option.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.710
I prepared yesterday.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.253
I could take us away from here somewhere else.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.920
SAM: What does that mean?

00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:54.870
LIAM: Well, I've been hesitant to bamf us anywhere

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.670
because of the nature of this place, but it is possible.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.223
So we have an option if we want to roll the dice,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.703
to spirit away somewhere else.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.410
MARISHA: Would we go closer into Aeor or out of here?

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.133
SAM: Could you get us somewhere you've never been before?
LAURA: We're being very quiet, having this conversation.

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:14.660
LIAM: That seems dangerous to me. It's not a great option,

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.165
I just want you aware of it.

00:14:16.165 --> 00:14:18.810
I could probably get us back to Balenpost.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.130
That seems possible?

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.920
We've been there.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.200
Going somewhere we've never been seems foolhardy.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.033
MARISHA: Okay.

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:31.840
SAM: But we could-- we could arrive with, like,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.970
each other's arms and legs and stuff.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.372
We don't know what could happen.

00:14:35.372 --> 00:14:37.139
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Or ride with butterflies.

00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:40.640
TALIESIN: I'm making tea and I'm
going to offer it to the whole,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.923
I'm away from this,

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.673
so, attempting to--
MATT: Fair enough.

00:14:43.673 --> 00:14:47.800
LIAM: Or we could do it later. It's just-- it's an option,

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.325
if we rest. I'm a little hesitant about it as well,

00:14:50.325 --> 00:14:53.650
because if we leave, they're still going

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.740
to go about their business.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.150
They're still going to find another one of these things.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.905
It might take them another week, I don't know.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.670
But if we're in danger, I could do it.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.786
SAM: Okay, well, should we-- is it something that you need--

00:15:08.786 --> 00:15:11.001
that you can cast right away?

00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:12.600
LIAM: Yeah, if I, certainly--

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.350
SAM: Then should we have a signal or something?

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.690
TRAVIS: Do we need to be touching?

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.730
SAM: Touching tips?

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.407
LIAM: No, I just need to see you.

00:15:18.407 --> 00:15:20.270
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: (giggling)

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.310
MATT: Caduceus make a perception check for me.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.143
LIAM: Tips up.

00:15:23.143 --> 00:15:26.005
LAURA: See, we're doing-- we're talking real quiet,

00:15:26.005 --> 00:15:27.180
about this dumb--
TALIESIN: 20.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.420
LAURA: Ooh, a 20.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.950
MATT: You rolled a 20 or a 20 total?

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:30.783
TALIESIN: 20 total.

00:15:30.783 --> 00:15:32.539
MATT: Okay, no worries.

00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:33.740
Continue.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.653
MARISHA: Also, I just wanted to mention,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.310
we have a pretty good advantage right now

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.410
because he doesn't know how much we know

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.960
and we should keep it that way.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.650
LAURA: I'm looking over. Is anybody looking in our direction

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.010
while we're having this conversation

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.500
in front of a whole bunch of enemies?

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.710
MATT: You guys are being very quiet and huddled,

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.830
but you're not being secretive

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.510
about having a huddled conversation out in the open.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.150
You're-- I mean, you are surrounded by snow

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.870
that fell off the dome when it collapsed,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.580
but you're all just poking your heads out

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.790
like prairie dogs at the moment

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.490
and pushing through it

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.430
and gathering and having this conversation.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.020
Yes, exactly.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.676
Role-playing, bonus points.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.760
TRAVIS: And we can see all of their party?

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.130
There's no one that is missing?

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.170
Cree is there, right?

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.640
Everybody's accounted for?
MATT: Yep.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.300
All five of the Tomb Takers that
you're aware of are present.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.598
Of which currently Lucien's turned away from you,

00:16:22.598 --> 00:16:24.390
looking over towards the sunrise.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.637
Seems to be like stretching--
LAURA: He's listening.

00:16:26.637 --> 00:16:28.220
MATT: Kind of getting himself ready for a journey.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.580
And the other four are--

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.330
TALIESIN: He's clearly listening.
MATT: They're just looking over at you all.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.725
ASHLEY: I don't think they're going to let us sleep.

00:16:38.725 --> 00:16:39.980
SAM: Let's try.
TRAVIS: Yeah, one way to find out.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.410
SAM: Let's try, yeah.
LAURA: Maybe they will.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.800
They seem very, very, very charming and handsome.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.716
And like really nice people.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.333
SAM: Sure.

00:16:54.673 --> 00:16:55.506
ASHLEY: (yawns)

00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:57.510
SAM: Why don't you guys rack out?

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.370
I'll stay up with Ducey and--

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.640
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just making a
little food and tea for everybody

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.023
who's going to stay up.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.410
MARISHA: I'm going to stay up as well.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.820
MATT: All right, you guys-- within a short time,

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.170
two things you pick up on.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.918
One, as you're gathering your things,

00:17:12.918 --> 00:17:14.493
scooping through the snow,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.960
you do bump into a piece of metal

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.496
and realize that that the snow that's fallen in a pile--

00:17:21.496 --> 00:17:23.631
SAM: (gasps)
MATT: Dagen is there.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.520
He's just being very quiet.
SAM: Oh.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.620
LAURA: Oh, I thought he was buried in the snow

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.302
and he was like suffocated and we didn't help him.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:35.080
(laughter)
MATT: No, no, no, no.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.563
MARISHA: We've been having this conversation--

00:17:36.563 --> 00:17:37.721
TRAVIS: He's just like--
MARISHA: -- this whole time.

00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:40.163
MATT: He just-- you get the sense, like,

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.830
you don't know if he's alive

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.020
and you wait for a second

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.730
and you see a faint breath.
LAURA: Okay.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.090
MATT: And there's a little part of you that imagines

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.580
that as soon as any sign of anything weird went down,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.210
he basically just hid into the snow.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.487
LIAM: He's pulling a Schwarzenegger in Predator.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.573
TALIESIN: Good call.
LAURA: So cool. (laughs)

00:18:03.815 --> 00:18:06.210
TALIESIN: Do they eat and drink the food?

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.870
I suppose would be my question.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.690
MATT: You offer tea, right?

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.180
Food, they don't take, but tea, warm tea,

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.703
three members accept, including Lucien.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.620
But after a fifteen minute period of time,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.330
Lucien sits up, hands back the cup

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.403
that you offer him and goes, "Right.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.120
"Right as rain, right?

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.678
"Shall we be on the road?"

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.291
SAM: I guess so!

00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:34.923
MATT: "Don't mean to be rushing you,

00:18:34.923 --> 00:18:38.163
"but we're going out on a limb here,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.630
"trusting that we can travel together for a bit,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.330
"and to, ah, I would be remiss if I didn't notice

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.550
"at the disadvantage that you all happen to be at.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.660
"Consider this just safety for us,

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.760
"as you are quite accomplished individuals

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.123
"to have made your way through two Aeorian ruins.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.820
"I would not want to find ourselves on the opposite end

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.270
"of a seemingly unhappy and tense group

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.113
"of heroes and adventurers."

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.323
TALIESIN: I appreciate truth before politeness.

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:18.303
LAURA: (laughs)

00:19:18.303 --> 00:19:20.120
MATT: "Just being upfront."
SAM: Sure.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.340
MATT: "No funny business. If we wanted you dead right now,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.390
"we would have already done so."

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.498
TALIESIN: That's true.

00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:30.283
A little strange, even, but true.

00:19:30.283 --> 00:19:31.224
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:19:31.224 --> 00:19:35.000
TRAVIS: Sure, how far do you plan to travel today?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.217
What is our destination before the sun sets?

00:19:38.217 --> 00:19:39.757
MATT: "Well, if we leave now, we can certainly make it

00:19:39.757 --> 00:19:43.590
"to the river of lava before the sun sets.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.230
"Probably camp along the side there.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.230
"Might be a bit warmer than some
of the other accommodations.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.570
"Then first thing in the morning's light,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:57.510
"weather be willing, we'll traverse it."

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:00.703
LAURA: Cool.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.190
MARISHA: Can I make an insight check on him?

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.023
MATT: Sure.

00:20:06.617 --> 00:20:08.166
What are you trying to gather?
MARISHA: Would he have actually

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.607
killed us or does he need us?

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.530
I just to want to get a beat on his dis--

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.914
Wait, why did I roll twice?
MATT: Why did you roll twice?

00:20:14.914 --> 00:20:16.700
MARISHA: I don't know. I thought
I was still at disadvantage,

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.711
but I'm not exhausted anymore.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.250
What did I say?

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.445
I'm going to make an insight check.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:20:25.445 --> 00:20:26.737
MARISHA: 22.

00:20:26.737 --> 00:20:27.645
MATT: 22.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.623
You get the sense that he's confident they could've,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.088
but...

00:20:40.605 --> 00:20:41.946
there are--

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.789
he's withholding for a reason.

00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:48.400
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.110
MATT: You are of some use to him in some way

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.573
and that's why he hasn't just killed you outright.

00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:56.127
TRAVIS: That was a 22?

00:20:56.127 --> 00:20:57.480
MATT: That's as much as you can gather.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.313
MARISHA: Okay.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.363
SAM: Well, are we taking the lead or you?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.553
MATT: "Hmm.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.113
"Well, we know where we're going.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.090
"We've been there before,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.970
"so we can take the lead."

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:13.803
TALIESIN: Makes sense.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.990
SAM: And just so we know who we're traveling with,

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.698
it's Lucien, Cree, Zoran?

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:25.612
MATT: Points over. (deep, gruff) "Yeah, it's me."

00:21:25.612 --> 00:21:27.110
TRAVIS: Zoran?

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.015
MATT: "Yeah, Zoran."
LAURA: Zoran.

00:21:29.015 --> 00:21:30.098
MATT: "What of it?"

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.823
TRAVIS: And?

00:21:32.823 --> 00:21:37.660
SAM: And I'll say in Halfling: Hello!

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.107
Hello, young lady.

00:21:40.107 --> 00:21:41.073
What's your name?

00:21:41.073 --> 00:21:42.010
MATT: "Otis."

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.397
SAM: Oh, you're Otis.
MATT: "Ah."

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.232
SAM: I'm Veth, nice to meet you.

00:21:47.232 --> 00:21:48.250
MARISHA: Otis has like a tie, what's a tie--

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.647
MATT: "Nice to meet you as well."
SAM: What village did you come from?

00:21:50.647 --> 00:21:52.920
MATT: "Oh, well I grew up in Trostenwald originally,

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.232
"but the place is a fucking dump."

00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:57.098
SAM: Yeah, we've been there. It is a dump.

00:21:59.758 --> 00:22:02.466
MATT: And there's the elf, goes,

00:22:02.466 --> 00:22:05.082
"(sighs) And I'm Tyffial.

00:22:05.082 --> 00:22:05.915
MARISHA: Tyffial.

00:22:05.915 --> 00:22:07.090
LAURA: Tyffial, yes.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.703
MATT: (as Lucien) "So I guess we're taking the lead.

00:22:11.703 --> 00:22:13.928
"Grab your things.

00:22:13.928 --> 00:22:15.610
"Don't wander too far,

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.140
"strength in numbers out here

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.020
"in the dangerous expanse of Eiselcross."

00:22:21.828 --> 00:22:26.330
TALIESIN: Not that we're particularly helpful
right now, but sure.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.800
MATT: "Good. (claps)

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.520
"Day's young, lots of walking.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.533
"Maybe some talking."

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.117
He begins to pick up as the rest
of the group continues to walk.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.756
MARISHA: What are we going to do with Dagen?

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.160
Saying deeply under my breath

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.174
after they take a few, a couple steps away--

00:22:44.174 --> 00:22:45.090
SAM: In Thieves' Cant.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.638
MARISHA: In Thieves' Cant. In Halfling Thieves' Cant.

00:22:47.638 --> 00:22:49.185
MATT: You hear a, you hear a--

00:22:49.185 --> 00:22:52.940
LIAM: (babbling)
(laughter)

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.193
MARISHA: It's just [inaudible].

00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:57.300
MATT: When you whisper that as you you're fairly confident

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.750
they're a little ways out of earshot,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.680
you hear a voice from under the snow muffled, go,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.222
(as Dagen) "Don't worry about me."

00:23:03.222 --> 00:23:05.802
(laughter)

00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:08.802
"I'm going to follow at a safe distance.

00:23:09.772 --> 00:23:12.684
"I'm not here."

00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:14.030
LAURA: Awesome.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.757
ASHLEY: That's really cool.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:23:15.757 --> 00:23:17.056
TALIESIN: Gone full Predator.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.570
MARISHA: Okay, I'm surprised he still wants to come with us,

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.210
but sure, yeah, hell yeah, man.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.568
MATT: "I want the other half of my pay."

00:23:25.568 --> 00:23:28.318
(laughter)

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.105
LAURA: He loves us.

00:23:31.105 --> 00:23:32.770
He's secretly in love with us.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.820
TALIESIN: I feel that the phrase,
"I want the other half of my money"

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.568
is probably just three syllables in Thieves' Cant.

00:23:37.568 --> 00:23:40.197
(laughter)
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:23:40.197 --> 00:23:42.324
TALIESIN: Ta'pluck't.

00:23:42.324 --> 00:23:43.449
(laughter)

00:23:43.449 --> 00:23:44.532
ASHLEY: Fair enough.

00:23:48.284 --> 00:23:50.970
TRAVIS: Okay, we follow.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.550
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're walking.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.600
MATT: All right, without a full night's rest,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.070
everyone does suffer a point of exhaustion

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.653
who did not complete it, that's all of you.

00:23:58.653 --> 00:24:00.360
TALIESIN: Got a short rest, though.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.260
LIAM: Which is on checks, right?

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.773
MATT: Exactly, disadvantage on ability checks.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.170
But--
LAURA: Where do we put that?

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.670
SAM: Under conditions, under you hit point maximum.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.720
MARISHA: At the very bottom.
SAM: The bottom.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.439
TALIESIN: But do remember, you got a short rest.

00:24:14.439 --> 00:24:15.590
I'll just put it in my brain.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.670
MATT: Indeed, those of you who got a short rest,

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.860
you did get that.
LAURA: Sure, great, cool.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.600
MATT: You're exhausted. It is a fairly, once again,

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.383
a moderately clear sky for what you've experienced here.

00:24:24.383 --> 00:24:27.330
There are still, you know, gray clouds, probably,

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.840
you know, a third of the sky still held by them.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.340
But quite a bit of blue is peeking through,

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.410
it's a calmer, more beautiful morning out here

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.320
in your travels and it's welcoming,

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.240
if not for the blearing light that's now finding your eyes

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.870
and you're all trudging

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.710
through the snow and ice, exhausted.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.590
But you keep pace with the Tomb Takers,

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.170
who are keeping pretty decent pace,

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.590
not as fast as you would have been,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.281
perhaps if you were following

00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:57.480
your friend who was guiding you,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.120
but not too terribly slow, as you are

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.210
following in their footsteps,

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.360
And they're moving at a pretty decent pace.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.120
But they keep on about maybe 20 or so feet ahead of you.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.330
And occasionally they're just

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.170
keeping eyes over their shoulders.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.860
They're having conversations amongst themselves.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.490
You hear a couple distant laughs.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.400
You know, they're friends traveling,

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.870
but there's definitely a separation,

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.120
at least as much as you guys want to keep it.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:24.750
LAURA: Can I have a piggyback ride

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.821
and keep sleeping on somebody's back?

00:25:26.821 --> 00:25:29.372
(laughter)

00:25:29.372 --> 00:25:32.157
MATT: I don't know if I'd consider that restful sleep.

00:25:32.157 --> 00:25:33.425
(laughter)

00:25:33.425 --> 00:25:35.350
LAURA: Just thought I'd ask.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.300
ASHLEY: I could try to put you on my shoulders.

00:25:38.301 --> 00:25:40.300
LAURA: (laughs) Just like across.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.600
ASHLEY: You're just like-- (snores)

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.290
MATT: The kid who's done with Disneyland

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.628
right about six o'clock.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:45.628 --> 00:25:48.790
(laughter)

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.507
MATT: I've been that kid.

00:25:50.507 --> 00:25:51.913
I've been that adult.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.592
LIAM: Just got sugar and frosting all over your mouth.

00:25:55.592 --> 00:25:58.060
(laughter)

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.330
MATT: All right, is there anything in particular

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.080
you guys want to do as you journey?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.090
TALIESIN: Finish a long rest.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.866
LIAM: Regret.
MATT: You got that.

00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:07.000
TALIESIN: A lot of regret.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.870
SAM: I'll walk up and chat up Otis real quick.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.032
MATT: All right.

00:26:11.032 --> 00:26:13.570
SAM: If she'll have me.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.403
MATT: Okay.

00:26:14.403 --> 00:26:16.360
SAM: Hey there, Otis.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.510
MATT: "Oh, hello there."

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.780
SAM: You seemed-- I just wanted to follow up

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.420
on what we were talking about before.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.710
Do you-- you're from Trostenwald, right?

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.272
MATT: "I mean, long time ago."

00:26:29.272 --> 00:26:33.210
SAM: Oh, oh, because we've been there sort of recently.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.040
Like, we went to-- I think we stayed

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.853
at the Nestled Nook Inn. Do you remember that place?

00:26:38.768 --> 00:26:42.010
MATT: "Right, right now, I remember some of it, aye."

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.050
SAM: Do have family there, do you have--?

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.630
MATT: "Don't care."

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.723
SAM: You don't care about your family?

00:26:48.723 --> 00:26:50.890
MATT: "I don't care if I have any family."

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.570
SAM: Oh, but like I meant close family, like, you know,

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.260
husband, wife, you know, something like that.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.560
Kids?

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.193
MATT: "Not really, not a lot of family work in the Orders."

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.450
SAM: Not a lot of family work in the Orders, huh?

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.294
MATT: "Yeah, not really."

00:27:06.294 --> 00:27:08.110
(laughter)

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.540
SAM: Yeah, that's what I hear about it.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.058
(laughter)

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.523
MATT: "What are you on about?"

00:27:17.523 --> 00:27:21.080
SAM: I just, I don't, there's no other, like,

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.230
like us. I don't run into a lot of us, you know,

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.677
or I haven't been traveling with any other halflings

00:27:26.677 --> 00:27:31.660
and it's nice to see a familiar, you know, body.

00:27:33.177 --> 00:27:36.140
MATT: "Well, you're not wrong, you're not wrong.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.230
"Traveling with tall folk all the time, it's just kind of--

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.470
"hmm, I don't know."

00:27:42.817 --> 00:27:45.209
SAM: You know what the worst part--
MATT: "Good to find someone on your level."

00:27:45.209 --> 00:27:46.500
SAM: Yeah, no, but the worst part about it

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.160
is they don't understand,

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.820
if they don't shower for a few days,

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.242
when you walk by someone's ass, it stinks, right?

00:27:53.242 --> 00:27:55.610
I mean, like, and we're down there all the time,

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.500
smelling crotches and butts.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.990
MATT: Otis glances briefly over in Zoran's direction

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.630
and goes, "Yeah."

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.023
SAM: Yeah, it's gross.
(laughter)

00:28:04.023 --> 00:28:05.640
MATT: "Yeah."

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.230
SAM: Well, I don't know what your sort of,

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.610
you know, specialties are, but when the shit goes down,

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.627
I got your back, right?

00:28:14.578 --> 00:28:15.411
MATT: "Right."

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.033
SAM: And you got mine.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.843
MATT: "Right."

00:28:22.956 --> 00:28:24.422
SAM: Cool, cool.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.040
All right, well, I'm going to go check on

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.000
my stinky friends.
MATT: "Of course, of course.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.150
"Don't be afraid to come talk."

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:34.983
SAM: You too!

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.800
MATT: "Enjoyed the conversation."

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.785
SAM: Bye in Halfling!

00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:44.437
(laughter)

00:28:44.437 --> 00:28:46.700
TALIESIN: Bye in Halfling or buy an halfling?

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.800
SAM: Either one.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.890
MATT: Would somebody like to roll for the day's travel?

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:53.723
LAURA: Whose turn is it?

00:28:53.723 --> 00:28:56.576
TRAVIS: Don't look over here; please go counterclockwise.

00:28:56.576 --> 00:28:59.126
LAURA: I can try it, okay.
LIAM: I think it's you.

00:28:59.126 --> 00:29:02.035
LAURA: Just a good old d20.
MATT: Good old d20!

00:29:02.035 --> 00:29:03.947
LAURA: Let's do it!

00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:06.890
Eight!

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:07.920
MATT: Eight?

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.150
SAM: I feel like we've done eight before.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:09.983
LAURA: Eight is good.

00:29:09.983 --> 00:29:12.820
TALIESIN: He might change if you've already hit it.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.863
MATT: As you push on through the snow,

00:29:17.818 --> 00:29:20.460
the sky remains fairly clear.
MARISHA: Hey!

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.430
TRAVIS: What up, what up?

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.410
MATT: A warmer day than you're used to.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.640
Still freezing cold,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.820
but some of the days that you've traveled,

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.261
you actually might catch a little sweat on the inside

00:29:30.261 --> 00:29:34.210
of some of your furs, and it's nice, familiar.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.001
But no issues along the way.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.890
For the extended eight-ish or so hours

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.873
you guys continue moving, you hit the late afternoon.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.400
The sun hasn't set yet,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.310
but a point of rest is being discussed up ahead.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:59.070
And you can hear Lucien turn back and say,

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.940
"We're not far.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.601
"Hope you've got your comforts about you."

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.993
SAM: Come-- comforts?

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.403
MATT: "Ah, up over that hill."

00:30:12.403 --> 00:30:13.990
(snaps) And he points over,

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.712
it's guiding towards his group and you all.

00:30:16.712 --> 00:30:18.580
You can see there's a little bit of a rise up,

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.933
the crest of a couple of hills ahead of you.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.670
As you all begin to step up to it,

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:29.130
you can reach the top and about 10 feet

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.410
beyond the crest of that hill,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:35.470
it drops off into what you can immediately see

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:40.275
is this expansive river of molten rock

00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:45.258
slowly flowing from the right to the left,

00:30:45.258 --> 00:30:48.090
south to north, from where you're located.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.480
Well over a mile across to the opposite side,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.480
it is just a gulf, and it's just (burbling).

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.603
Occasionally (poofing) gas erupts from it in places.

00:30:59.603 --> 00:31:01.480
You can see darkened bits where it's cooled

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.570
and it's cracking apart.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.820
And then the glow from underneath peeks through

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.300
and pulls it into separate sections.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.858
It is ominous,

00:31:09.858 --> 00:31:13.190
and a deadly idea to traverse.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.080
LAURA: Also kind of hypnotic, you know?

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.930
TALIESIN: Yeah, could stare at that for hours.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.150
MATT: It does feel warmer by proximity.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.350
LIAM: You get that same feeling when you're in a high tower

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.800
or something and you have that urge.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.703
MATT: Yeah, Lucien turns back goes, "Indeed.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.113
"Don't do it.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.699
"Don't, don't jump."

00:31:35.699 --> 00:31:38.000
LAURA: (laughs)
MATT: "(laughs)"

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.857
LIAM: Day is young.

00:31:39.857 --> 00:31:41.375
TRAVIS: Okay, cool, cool, very cool.

00:31:41.375 --> 00:31:43.508
MARISHA: I hate him.

00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:47.310
SAM: Remember, he's Mollymauk inside.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.143
MARISHA: He's not.

00:31:48.143 --> 00:31:50.250
SAM: We just have to say the right, like, code word

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.083
to remind him.

00:31:51.083 --> 00:31:53.238
LAURA: It's like a combination of words.

00:31:53.238 --> 00:31:55.739
LIAM: Mollymauk was more of an effortless dick,

00:31:55.739 --> 00:31:57.880
and Lucien is, like, concentrated.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.713
MARISHA: Yes.

00:31:58.713 --> 00:32:00.340
LIAM: Pointed, pointed dick.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.160
LAURA: A pointed dick, never fun. Really.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.536
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Spotted dick, okay.

00:32:06.536 --> 00:32:08.900
Pointed dick, never.
LAURA: Bad idea.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.500
MARISHA: What's our plan? Are we supposed to?

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.470
SAM: Yes, I mean--

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.135
MARISHA: -- work with him, what are we doing?

00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:17.120
SAM: Are we going to camp?

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.823
Are we going to camp here tonight or try to cross?

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.672
LAURA: He said we were camping before, yeah?

00:32:23.672 --> 00:32:25.050
MATT: "You all look pretty tired.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.180
"You could probably use some rest."

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.013
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could.

00:32:27.013 --> 00:32:30.040
LAURA: Are you going to push us
in the lava when we go to sleep?

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.083
MATT: "Hopefully if you don't give us a reason.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.570
"Come, come, let's all scoop out a place to rest."

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.610
At which point they begin taking their arms

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:39.960
and pulling the snow back to

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.650
expose some of the ground beneath,

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.990
pushing some over the edge that falls and tumbles.

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.090
You're waiting for the hiss, but there is none.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:49.200
And eventually they carve out this little space.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.520
You can still see the frozen cracked ground beneath it

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.160
and elements of grayed, long-dead vegetation

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.540
and/or grass that maybe has adapted to the colder weather

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.440
and seems to thrive beneath the snow.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:05.440
It's hard to tell, but in this little space here,

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.710
it seems like rest can be had.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.083
And with the proximity, it's almost comfortable,

00:33:11.136 --> 00:33:14.670
maybe a little campfire, but nothing too major.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:18.597
You guys won't have to be huddling for warmth necessarily

00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:20.630
or you could utilize your dome.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.830
SAM: Can you?

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.919
MATT: No, you can not, not without a long rest, right?

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:26.215
LIAM: No, I can definitely do it.

00:33:26.215 --> 00:33:27.340
MATT: Oh, as a ritual, you can.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.602
LIAM: I don't know if they are cool with it.

00:33:29.602 --> 00:33:32.538
LAURA: Well, they'll dispel it anyway.
MATT: You haven't asked them.

00:33:32.538 --> 00:33:33.888
TRAVIS: When the snow was pushed into the river,

00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:36.120
it didn't hiss because it just instantly turns to vapor

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.750
or because there's no lava and it's magic!

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.446
MATT: Do you want to go look?

00:33:40.446 --> 00:33:44.100
SAM: I think earlier he said that
ice can freeze on the lava.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.140
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.800
TRAVIS: Oh, because the ice out here is weird or something?

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.300
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to make a couple snowballs

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.250
and chuck them into the river.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.530
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: I kind of want to go look, too.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.066
MATT: The snowball (whooshing, poofing).

00:33:58.066 --> 00:34:00.967
And the snow just rests and moves along.

00:34:00.967 --> 00:34:03.640
MARISHA: What?
TRAVIS: What is that about?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.640
LIAM: I pull us a stone, just a stone

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.990
out of my pouch of components and throw that

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.910
and see what it does.

00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:14.070
MATT: (whooshing)

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.170
Gone.
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.820
TRAVIS: But the snow--
LIAM: That is weird.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:21.150
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast--

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:24.140
TALIESIN: This is weird.
SAM: Would it work with water?

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.298
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Create Water

00:34:26.298 --> 00:34:29.806
and it falls in 10 gallons,

00:34:29.806 --> 00:34:32.420
a 30-foot cube, like rain.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.210
MATT: (hissing)

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.230
You see it just turn immediately to steam

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:39.360
and then rise and dissipate.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.265
TRAVIS: Huh.
ASHLEY: Are we close to the flow shift?

00:34:43.265 --> 00:34:44.931
LAURA: The what?
ASHLEY: The flow shift, is that--

00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:45.912
TRAVIS: This is what that is?

00:34:45.912 --> 00:34:48.017
Oh, oh, we're north of the flow shift.

00:34:48.017 --> 00:34:49.530
That nexus point, yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:50.363
LIAM: Why would that be?

00:34:50.363 --> 00:34:55.230
I wonder if the Aeorian ruins have infused

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.350
the snow and ice here with some property or?

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.780
TALIESIN: Or maybe the lava itself has some prop--

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.613
LIAM: The lava, yeah.

00:35:02.613 --> 00:35:03.593
SAM: What about ice?

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.430
ASHLEY: Wait, which way is the lava flow?
SAM: Like, we know snow,

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.720
but what about ice?
LAURA: I don't feel like we have any ice.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.265
MATT: You guys are heading eastward.
SAM: We can make ice, we all have water spells.

00:35:11.265 --> 00:35:14.085
TALIESIN: But the lava's going--?
MATT: The lava's going south to north.

00:35:14.085 --> 00:35:14.996
SAM: I do.

00:35:14.996 --> 00:35:16.650
LAURA: Well, then make some fucking ice.
ASHLEY: It's south to north?

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.480
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: So it's going up the--

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.920
TALIESIN: It's weird.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.803
SAM: I will cast Shape Water

00:35:22.803 --> 00:35:25.061
and freeze, you can freeze water.

00:35:25.061 --> 00:35:30.061
I guess I'll pour some water in my hand

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.500
and freeze it, I don't know. (laughs)

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.814
MATT: Sure, okay, you pour a little water into your hand

00:35:35.814 --> 00:35:38.620
and you freeze it, you have a little block of ice.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.900
SAM: And throw it.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.120
MATT: Okay.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.230
You see it hit and skid a little bit.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.900
SAM: Oh, okay.
LAURA: Oh!

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.730
SAM: Ice and snow, okay.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.470
LAURA: How long-- Are the snowballs that I threw,

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.450
are they still flowing on the top of it

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.380
or have they disintegrated?
MATT: Yeah, no,

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.890
they're still on top, just scattered.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.910
And they're just moving slowly with the flow.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:58.840
LAURA: Interesting, maybe we can make some ice chunks

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.658
and sail across.

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:01.820
SAM: Yeah, like ice skates.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.130
TRAVIS: Ice bridge?

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.870
TALIESIN: I'm going to fire it.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.130
I'm going to try Sacred Flame just to see

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.420
if it disturbs the lava.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.010
MATT: You see a big flash of radiant energy,

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.620
but it has no impact.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.959
It is molten rock and the radiant fire
wouldn't necessarily--

00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:18.910
TALIESIN: It wouldn't necessarily.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.160
That's very strange.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.570
LAURA: Hey Lucien, have you guys crossed this river before?

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.230
MATT: "Uh-huh."

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.790
LIAM: How do you do it?

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.090
MATT: You'll see in the morning.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.368
TALIESIN: I mean, we can do it just fine on our own, so.

00:36:31.368 --> 00:36:32.900
(laughter)

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.019
MATT: "You asked me."

00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:37.080
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, but we'll tell you how we do it.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.910
MATT: "Okay, we'll swap tips in the morning."

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.830
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: "Excitedly.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.740
"But," he glances over and you see as Otis

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.120
is currently kneeling on the ground

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.730
and in the central space here,

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.000
clusters of a bit of the grass

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.060
and then with their hand across the air (flames whoosh)

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.785
becomes a bit of a fire.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.180
"A few more hours of daylight.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.467
"Who's up for some lunch?"

00:37:04.467 --> 00:37:06.100
SAM: Some lunch, did you say?

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.260
MATT: "Yeah, or supper, depending.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.590
"We've been traveling quite a bit."

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.899
LAURA: I could eat.
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:13.600
MARISHA: For sure.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.550
MATT: "All right."

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:19.030
They have a heavy pack, which you've seen on Zoran's back.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.570
It's this massive pack, that, based on the shape,

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.910
the weird oblong shape of it

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.010
and the weight that he carries it with,

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.930
this one seems to actually contain the other threshold crest

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.580
from the first ruin.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.020
As he sets it down, there's a number of side pouches

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.020
and rummaging through,

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.320
pulls out heavy bits of jerky

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.960
and throws them to each of you.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.067
And (as Zoran) "That'll spice up rations a little bit, eh?"

00:37:45.685 --> 00:37:47.655
SAM: Sure.

00:37:47.655 --> 00:37:48.730
I'm going to just look at it,

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.950
see if I can discern what animal it came from.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.370
MATT: Roll a nature check.
SAM: Nature check.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:56.900
Seven.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.456
Oh wait, disadvantage.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:37:59.456 --> 00:38:01.670
SAM: Seven.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.704
MATT: You hope it's not people.

00:38:03.704 --> 00:38:05.411
Hard to tell, hard to tell.

00:38:05.411 --> 00:38:06.244
MARISHA: It's so delicious.

00:38:06.244 --> 00:38:07.590
MATT: Jerky.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.220
TRAVIS: Mm, cob--
SAM: Are they eating it?

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.053
MATT: Yeah.

00:38:10.053 --> 00:38:11.699
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.
MATT: And they're eating other food.

00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:13.350
They're not sharing all their rations with you,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.760
but they're offering something to pepper up

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.850
what you brought with you.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:17.667
They assume you took care of yourselves on this journey.

00:38:17.667 --> 00:38:18.500
LIAM: I eat a boba.

00:38:19.584 --> 00:38:21.191
MATT: (laughs)

00:38:21.191 --> 00:38:22.863
TALIESIN: I'll have a bit of that boba.

00:38:22.863 --> 00:38:26.887
LAURA: I pull out some
really stale pastries from Nicodranas.

00:38:29.597 --> 00:38:32.077
TALIESIN: We need to get you some sort of--
LIAM: Throw it out in the lava.

00:38:32.077 --> 00:38:36.007
TALIESIN: -- like, pocket oven or something, I don't know.

00:38:36.007 --> 00:38:37.597
TALIESIN: Someone's got to make that.
LAURA: Do they make those?

00:38:37.597 --> 00:38:38.887
TALIESIN: I mean, someone's got to make a pouch

00:38:38.887 --> 00:38:40.047
that you just put some dough in

00:38:40.047 --> 00:38:41.843
and in, like, an hour you've got--

00:38:41.843 --> 00:38:43.637
TRAVIS: Bread?
TALIESIN: -- bread or something.

00:38:43.637 --> 00:38:44.867
That seems.

00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:47.447
LAURA: I'll keep an eye out for some sort of enchantment.

00:38:47.447 --> 00:38:48.947
A dough enchantment.

00:38:48.947 --> 00:38:50.147
TALIESIN: Like a little easy bake.

00:38:50.147 --> 00:38:51.522
Yeah, a bag of easy bake.

00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:54.392
TRAVIS: License that to Gilmore.

00:38:54.392 --> 00:38:55.818
LAURA: Honestly, just like

00:38:55.818 --> 00:38:59.597
a cold bag that will keep, you know,

00:38:59.597 --> 00:39:03.929
like a little bag of colding, something like that.

00:39:03.929 --> 00:39:05.187
TALIESIN: I feel like that's beyond science

00:39:05.187 --> 00:39:06.326
and magic's ability. I'm not sure.

00:39:06.326 --> 00:39:08.687
LAURA: I don't know, it would be so useful.

00:39:08.687 --> 00:39:10.017
TALIESIN: So much easier to make something hotter

00:39:10.017 --> 00:39:11.881
than it is to make something cold.

00:39:13.539 --> 00:39:16.430
TRAVIS: Cree? I'm not talking to that.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.637
Do they carry anything around their neck?

00:39:18.637 --> 00:39:21.377
Vials, necklaces, any kind of jewelry, anything like that?

00:39:21.377 --> 00:39:22.477
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:39:26.939 --> 00:39:28.272
TRAVIS: 12.
MARISHA: Come on.

00:39:28.272 --> 00:39:30.783
SAM: With disadvantage.
TRAVIS: Shut up.

00:39:30.783 --> 00:39:32.757
12. That didn't really roll.

00:39:32.757 --> 00:39:34.240
MATT: I mean, you've seen it before.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.606
All that you can make out
amongst the huddled fur and thick leather

00:39:37.606 --> 00:39:41.727
and a blanket-like covering beyond that as well.

00:39:41.727 --> 00:39:43.437
There is a thick chain

00:39:43.437 --> 00:39:46.177
that occasionally appears around her neck

00:39:46.177 --> 00:39:48.807
that has a circular red stone in the middle of it.

00:39:48.807 --> 00:39:51.533
Like a deep, dark red coloration.

00:39:52.417 --> 00:39:54.357
TRAVIS: And just her or the others as well?

00:39:54.357 --> 00:39:56.407
MATT: From what you've seen, just her.

00:39:56.407 --> 00:39:57.948
LAURA: Mm.

00:39:59.117 --> 00:40:01.220
LIAM: As long as we are sharing a meal,

00:40:02.677 --> 00:40:05.737
perhaps we can learn a little bit more about each other.

00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:08.327
I use a Control Flames, which is a cantrip,

00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:12.154
and I can manipulate shapes out of the fire.

00:40:12.154 --> 00:40:15.897
And I make the shape of the city on the Astral Sea.

00:40:15.897 --> 00:40:18.334
It's crude, but it's very clear what it is,

00:40:18.334 --> 00:40:19.762
floating above the fire.

00:40:22.097 --> 00:40:25.197
Are you going to make us wait until we arrive

00:40:25.197 --> 00:40:28.037
before we know what you intend to do,

00:40:28.037 --> 00:40:30.407
or can you share a little bit in advance?

00:40:33.167 --> 00:40:34.603
MATT: (as Lucien) "Bread crumbs can be fun."

00:40:34.603 --> 00:40:36.186
(laughter)

00:40:36.186 --> 00:40:39.994
Jesus Christ, Sam!
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh!

00:40:39.994 --> 00:40:41.557
SAM: Those are cobwebs because

00:40:41.557 --> 00:40:44.037
I'm the guy who has his Christmas tree up

00:40:44.037 --> 00:40:45.941
for, like, a month after Christmas.

00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:47.747
(laughter)

00:40:47.747 --> 00:40:50.842
MATT: The joke's funnier when you have to explain it.
TRAVIS: -- its own zip code, man.

00:40:50.842 --> 00:40:53.042
You need to wrist brace to--

00:40:53.042 --> 00:40:54.987
LAURA: Those are cobwebs.

00:40:54.987 --> 00:40:56.264
TRAVIS: Not snow, it's cobwebs.

00:40:56.264 --> 00:40:58.662
LIAM: Spider in the Christmas tree
is supposed to be good luck.

00:40:58.662 --> 00:41:00.116
TRAVIS: Is that right?
LIAM: Yep.

00:41:00.116 --> 00:41:00.958
LAURA: Oh!

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:05.007
LIAM: I have a spider on my tree every year.

00:41:05.007 --> 00:41:07.527
MATT: "Well, let's see. If we're going to be

00:41:07.527 --> 00:41:10.195
"learning about each other,

00:41:10.195 --> 00:41:15.195
"what do you want: where it started or where it's going?"

00:41:15.557 --> 00:41:16.610
SAM: Like that meme.

00:41:18.737 --> 00:41:21.610
LIAM: Well, I am a fan of history.

00:41:23.687 --> 00:41:25.354
Let's start there.

00:41:26.377 --> 00:41:29.048
MATT: Leans back and flicks the toothpick.

00:41:29.048 --> 00:41:30.184
TRAVIS: Ow!

00:41:30.184 --> 00:41:31.757
MATT: "(chuckles) Sorry."

00:41:31.757 --> 00:41:36.582
(laughter)

00:41:38.092 --> 00:41:40.524
"You're a bit broader than I was expecting."

00:41:40.524 --> 00:41:42.435
TRAVIS: It's okay.
LIAM: God, quick, Travis.

00:41:42.435 --> 00:41:47.102
(laughter)

00:41:48.397 --> 00:41:50.247
MATT: "Well, me and my friends here, we're--

00:41:51.527 --> 00:41:55.277
"we're from a disparate collective, you would say,

00:41:55.277 --> 00:41:57.317
"called the Claret Orders."

00:41:59.097 --> 00:42:01.231
MARISHA: Claret Orders.
LIAM: Like wines?

00:42:01.231 --> 00:42:04.547
LAURA: Oh right, Claret Orders.

00:42:04.547 --> 00:42:05.789
MATT: "Like wine.

00:42:07.727 --> 00:42:08.937
"So some of us grew up together.

00:42:08.937 --> 00:42:11.917
"Some of us just found like-minded interest

00:42:11.917 --> 00:42:14.397
"in taking the things we learned

00:42:14.397 --> 00:42:15.957
"and eventually sticking out on our own

00:42:15.957 --> 00:42:20.919
"because we've all got an inherent dislike of authority.

00:42:25.407 --> 00:42:30.257
"And in our travels, much like you, were traveling

00:42:30.257 --> 00:42:31.870
"with the good lady.

00:42:32.757 --> 00:42:35.397
"We found ourselves hired by her and others for some time,

00:42:35.397 --> 00:42:38.052
"made some good coin, did some travel.

00:42:41.157 --> 00:42:42.330
"And I found a secret.

00:42:45.217 --> 00:42:48.457
"I found a little peek into something beyond,"

00:42:48.457 --> 00:42:50.637
and he points to the fire,

00:42:50.637 --> 00:42:54.520
"Something with promise, knowledge.

00:42:57.917 --> 00:43:00.567
"And when I looked in, it looked back.

00:43:02.727 --> 00:43:06.210
"So at that point,

00:43:07.267 --> 00:43:09.328
"Lucien became more of a--

00:43:12.617 --> 00:43:14.038
"more of a costume.

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:21.060
"The Nonagon became more of

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.685
"the presence.

00:43:25.527 --> 00:43:28.587
"So that's where it started specifically.

00:43:30.597 --> 00:43:31.430
"Found a book.

00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:34.807
"You seem to be fond of books.

00:43:34.807 --> 00:43:35.707
"Heavy reader?"

00:43:36.887 --> 00:43:38.036
LIAM: One or two.

00:43:38.036 --> 00:43:38.869
MATT: "Hmm.

00:43:40.077 --> 00:43:41.380
"Couldn't put this one down.

00:43:45.587 --> 00:43:47.750
"So what are you all doing here?

00:43:49.477 --> 00:43:50.387
"I know you're certainly curious.

00:43:50.387 --> 00:43:51.337
"You wouldn't follow this far,

00:43:51.337 --> 00:43:53.425
"but you have some sort of history with

00:43:55.542 --> 00:43:59.601
"whatever was piloting this for a while.

00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:02.730
"Are you coming to join? Are you coming to stop me?"

00:44:03.947 --> 00:44:07.177
LIAM: Well, it's a lot of coincidences, really.

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:09.519
We were quite fond of our friend.

00:44:10.587 --> 00:44:13.677
So that alone does draw us in a bit.

00:44:13.677 --> 00:44:16.187
MATT: "Well, it's hard not to be fond to this."

00:44:19.187 --> 00:44:23.507
LIAM: You're not entirely different from the friend we knew.

00:44:23.507 --> 00:44:25.943
LAURA: We've seen you with food on your penis.

00:44:27.037 --> 00:44:28.697
MATT: At which point, every other member

00:44:28.697 --> 00:44:31.040
of the Tomb Takers starts laughing.

00:44:32.267 --> 00:44:34.617
MATT: Lucien's heads slowly turns towards you and goes--

00:44:36.567 --> 00:44:37.637
LIAM: All of us.

00:44:37.637 --> 00:44:39.687
MARISHA: You tried to pass it off as the plague.

00:44:40.717 --> 00:44:42.060
LIAM: You covered it in egg.

00:44:43.092 --> 00:44:44.877
MARISHA: It was real gross and a real bad idea,

00:44:44.877 --> 00:44:45.710
to be totally honest.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:46.543
LAURA: (laughs)

00:44:46.543 --> 00:44:49.652
MATT: "That wasn't me. That was an aberration."

00:44:49.652 --> 00:44:50.967
MARISHA: Same dick.

00:44:50.967 --> 00:44:55.327
(laughter)

00:44:55.327 --> 00:45:00.127
MATT: He actually laughs to himself at that. (laughs)

00:45:00.127 --> 00:45:03.207
"Well, I guess there are some secrets

00:45:03.207 --> 00:45:05.890
"I don't have to introduce at some point, right?"

00:45:09.977 --> 00:45:12.027
LIAM: That's not the only coincidence, though.

00:45:13.687 --> 00:45:15.967
It's a few things.

00:45:15.967 --> 00:45:19.767
We have entanglements with the Assembly

00:45:21.267 --> 00:45:24.035
and with our old friend, your fragment,

00:45:26.027 --> 00:45:30.970
and we have heard whispers on the wind of the city as well.

00:45:32.297 --> 00:45:33.547
MATT: "Word is getting around."

00:45:34.547 --> 00:45:36.567
LIAM: We are curious about the intersections

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:39.570
of those threads of fate.

00:45:41.637 --> 00:45:42.687
MATT: "I can respect that.

00:45:45.467 --> 00:45:48.567
"Well, speaking of intersections.

00:45:49.667 --> 00:45:53.175
"The book that I found,

00:45:53.175 --> 00:45:55.500
"fascinating read.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.931
"Couldn't understand most of it, but I have my limitations.

00:45:58.931 --> 00:46:00.657
LIAM: "What is the title?"

00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:02.037
MATT: "There's not much of a title to it.

00:46:02.037 --> 00:46:03.522
"It's more of a journal."

00:46:03.522 --> 00:46:06.380
LIAM: Oh, I can respect that.

00:46:07.787 --> 00:46:11.233
MARISHA: Would you like a second set of eyes on it?

00:46:12.297 --> 00:46:13.997
MATT: "No, I've done that once already.

00:46:14.927 --> 00:46:17.932
"Didn't end well ... for her."

00:46:20.287 --> 00:46:22.917
MARISHA: Seems to end well for you.

00:46:22.917 --> 00:46:24.167
MATT: "So far so good.

00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:31.457
"We were seeking somebody who we knew could possibly

00:46:31.457 --> 00:46:32.977
"understand some of the more

00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:39.547
"complicated aspects of this journal.

00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:41.937
"Having done previous work with the lady,

00:46:41.937 --> 00:46:45.253
"went her made a deal, a contract.

00:46:45.253 --> 00:46:47.019
"She promised to help...

00:46:48.157 --> 00:46:51.917
"help me utilize parts of this tome to

00:46:53.417 --> 00:46:54.590
"truly reach out.

00:46:57.697 --> 00:47:01.264
"You see, once I started reading it, it was just for fun.

00:47:03.931 --> 00:47:06.540
"But then the dreams started coming.

00:47:10.947 --> 00:47:12.597
"Something was spilling into them.

00:47:14.677 --> 00:47:16.747
"And it wanted my help,"

00:47:16.747 --> 00:47:17.877
and his eyes glance back over

00:47:17.877 --> 00:47:20.150
towards the fire and the shape.

00:47:23.545 --> 00:47:26.229
"With each dream, a different mind came to me,

00:47:27.078 --> 00:47:32.078
"Luctus, Gaudius, Ira,

00:47:32.137 --> 00:47:33.437
"Vigilan. One by one,

00:47:33.437 --> 00:47:36.087
"the Somnovum came to me

00:47:36.087 --> 00:47:37.920
"and showed me what the city was,

00:47:39.757 --> 00:47:42.530
"a collections of minds, finding emergence,

00:47:43.587 --> 00:47:47.597
"becoming one under these Eyes of Nine.

00:47:49.445 --> 00:47:52.377
"And each visit, they gave me one of these."

00:47:52.377 --> 00:47:54.660
He reveals the eye on his hand.

00:47:56.817 --> 00:47:58.367
"That's when I knew it was real.

00:47:59.787 --> 00:48:00.787
"And I had to follow.

00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:07.157
"I had to learn that which they promised to show.

00:48:10.107 --> 00:48:14.857
"So trying to reach past these limitations,

00:48:14.857 --> 00:48:16.057
"the lady was to help,

00:48:17.737 --> 00:48:18.987
"and she's a trained liar.

00:48:21.277 --> 00:48:24.490
"And the ritual was sabotaged.

00:48:25.857 --> 00:48:30.408
"As opposed to placing my spirit out there whole,

00:48:31.897 --> 00:48:33.849
"it shattered me out there

00:48:36.037 --> 00:48:37.550
"to many, many pieces.

00:48:40.207 --> 00:48:41.610
"She took the book for herself.

00:48:44.137 --> 00:48:45.917
"And from what I can tell,

00:48:45.917 --> 00:48:49.307
"tried to take up the same path, but (laughs).

00:48:52.787 --> 00:48:55.267
"The Somnovum found me,

00:48:55.267 --> 00:48:56.450
"put me back together.

00:48:59.857 --> 00:49:02.553
"And in that space, I learned so much more about them

00:49:02.553 --> 00:49:04.457
"than I could've ever hoped for.

00:49:07.427 --> 00:49:09.077
"So, in a way, I'm actually thankful,

00:49:10.197 --> 00:49:14.727
"but one can be thankful and vengeful at the same time."

00:49:14.727 --> 00:49:17.367
LIAM: Why do you think that was

00:49:17.367 --> 00:49:19.080
one of these pieces of you

00:49:20.087 --> 00:49:22.360
landed in a grave and ended up in the circus?

00:49:23.237 --> 00:49:26.577
What about the others, and where did you go

00:49:26.577 --> 00:49:30.857
that you would learn about these people?

00:49:30.857 --> 00:49:32.593
MATT: "Imagine, if you will,

00:49:34.577 --> 00:49:37.120
"you, the idea of you,

00:49:38.737 --> 00:49:40.277
"your singular conscience

00:49:41.807 --> 00:49:44.167
"and every thought you had

00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:46.817
"was accompanied by a hundred screaming thoughts

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:48.180
"fighting for attention.

00:49:51.507 --> 00:49:54.437
"A weird dissonance of thought.

00:49:54.437 --> 00:49:57.217
"That was the prison I was sent to.

00:49:57.217 --> 00:50:02.212
"My spirit broken and blown across the Astral winds.

00:50:05.617 --> 00:50:07.184
"But it took the Somnovum

00:50:08.467 --> 00:50:10.717
"following my scent, much like I followed hers

00:50:12.517 --> 00:50:14.967
"to find all my pieces and put them back together."

00:50:18.297 --> 00:50:19.847
LAURA: Do you think they missed any?

00:50:22.017 --> 00:50:24.320
MATT: "I'm here, aren't I?"
LAURA: Are you?

00:50:25.597 --> 00:50:28.757
MATT: "Well, lucky enough found this--

00:50:28.757 --> 00:50:30.317
"This body had been vacated

00:50:30.317 --> 00:50:32.467
"and easy enough to come back to."

00:50:39.647 --> 00:50:42.567
SAM: The Som-nah-vum. Novum?

00:50:42.567 --> 00:50:43.537
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:50:43.537 --> 00:50:47.210
SAM: Are they here on Exandria somewhere?

00:50:51.877 --> 00:50:54.577
MATT: "Maybe we'll talk more about this tomorrow.

00:50:54.577 --> 00:50:55.777
"It's been a fun conversation,

00:50:55.777 --> 00:50:57.757
"but it seems very one-sided."

00:50:57.757 --> 00:51:00.087
SAM: Well, you can feel free to ask us anything.

00:51:01.287 --> 00:51:03.077
About the times, you know, we've died

00:51:03.077 --> 00:51:05.937
or come back to life or got split into pieces

00:51:05.937 --> 00:51:08.387
and sent into memory prisons.

00:51:08.387 --> 00:51:09.877
TALIESIN: Read weird books.

00:51:11.746 --> 00:51:15.054
MATT: "You've gone through quite a bit of danger.

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:21.810
"Some would say blindly in some cases,

00:51:24.167 --> 00:51:25.977
"just to follow us up here

00:51:25.977 --> 00:51:28.194
"and even beat us to our own game.

"I'll ask again: Beyond just idle curiosity,

00:51:35.567 --> 00:51:39.408
"what is it you want?"

00:51:40.447 --> 00:51:44.830
LAURA: When you first saw your vision,

00:51:47.027 --> 00:51:49.020
What did you feel?

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.669
Did you-- did you instantly want the power

00:51:52.669 --> 00:51:54.222
of what you saw, or--

00:51:57.157 --> 00:51:58.470
or did you feel fear?

00:51:59.559 --> 00:52:02.450
MATT: "(laughs) Fear, fear immensely.

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:08.246
"I was but a person then; fear is the natural reaction.

00:52:08.246 --> 00:52:10.547
"And I take it by the recognition in your faces,

00:52:10.547 --> 00:52:14.147
"you've perhaps seen

00:52:14.147 --> 00:52:16.405
"shades of the same thing, too."

00:52:17.647 --> 00:52:19.242
TALIESIN: More than shades.

00:52:20.987 --> 00:52:21.820
MATT: "Hm."

00:52:22.877 --> 00:52:25.397
LIAM: We find ourselves very curious

00:52:27.487 --> 00:52:31.926
about the power you yourself are all consumed with.

00:52:31.926 --> 00:52:34.268
You're not alone, you have friends.

00:52:35.247 --> 00:52:37.402
We are accomplished people.

00:52:39.367 --> 00:52:41.017
I think we may be curious

00:52:41.017 --> 00:52:43.800
if there is room for us in your plans.

00:52:45.837 --> 00:52:46.987
MATT: "There might be still.

00:52:47.877 --> 00:52:49.927
"There's-- it's hard to explain.

00:52:49.927 --> 00:52:51.595
"There's a part of me that just--

00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:55.387
"I feel like you all have a part to play still.

00:52:58.047 --> 00:53:03.047
"Like you've-- you've use to me."

00:53:03.867 --> 00:53:06.237
MARISHA: Well, we got visions, too.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:53:06.237 --> 00:53:08.028
MARISHA: From the same city.

00:53:08.947 --> 00:53:13.447
LIAM: We are beyond coincidence at this point.

00:53:13.447 --> 00:53:16.472
LAURA: Do any of your companions have dreams of the city?

00:53:17.497 --> 00:53:19.197
MATT: At which point, Lucien looks over

00:53:19.197 --> 00:53:23.204
and they all glance at each other and nod,

00:53:23.204 --> 00:53:28.204
and then Cree leans forward a bit.

00:53:28.527 --> 00:53:33.077
"The dreams that we have are granted through Lucien,

00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:36.278
"through the connection that he's offered."

00:53:37.307 --> 00:53:39.897
MARISHA: Yeah, that's not what we mean.

00:53:39.897 --> 00:53:43.727
LAURA: Yeah, I imagine that if the city gave anybody dreams

00:53:43.727 --> 00:53:45.660
it might mean they were chosen.

00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:48.976
MATT: "We do not have such dreams.

00:53:48.976 --> 00:53:52.310
"The Nonagon, he's the one who has been chosen.

00:53:53.857 --> 00:53:57.807
"We follow in his steps, his guidance."

00:53:57.807 --> 00:53:59.937
Cree looks over with a smiling reverence

00:53:59.937 --> 00:54:00.890
in her face and says,

00:54:01.817 --> 00:54:03.817
"It is through him."

00:54:03.817 --> 00:54:05.437
And Lucien shoots a look

00:54:06.947 --> 00:54:08.095
and she gets a little quiet

00:54:08.095 --> 00:54:09.762
and goes back to sitting.

00:54:09.762 --> 00:54:10.595
(as Cree) "Well.

00:54:14.327 --> 00:54:17.360
"We trust him. His vision,

00:54:19.127 --> 00:54:20.447
"and in Somnovum."

00:54:20.447 --> 00:54:21.597
She looks up with reverence

00:54:21.597 --> 00:54:24.250
and closes her eyes and clutches that stone around her neck.

00:54:29.683 --> 00:54:32.766
MARISHA: Do you think you're special, Lucien?

00:54:34.405 --> 00:54:37.107
I mean, someone who wakes up every day,

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:40.840
thinks they're different, blessed.

00:54:42.117 --> 00:54:43.937
MATT: "I spent my entire life waking up every day

00:54:43.937 --> 00:54:45.287
"knowing that I'm different.

00:54:48.157 --> 00:54:48.990
"Look at me."

00:54:50.864 --> 00:54:52.197
LAURA: I think you're dreamy.

00:54:55.727 --> 00:54:57.527
MATT: "That's a new one as the years went on.

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.640
"Didn't start that way.

00:55:00.167 --> 00:55:03.077
"Not a lot of folks are really eager and kind,

00:55:03.077 --> 00:55:05.047
"especially in Shadycreek Run growing up,

00:55:06.457 --> 00:55:08.650
"to those of infernal blood.

00:55:13.347 --> 00:55:17.040
"But yeah, I'd say I feel pretty damn special these days.

00:55:19.507 --> 00:55:23.357
"Not everyone's single-handedly been granted the ability

00:55:23.357 --> 00:55:26.520
"to slaughter a member of the
Cerberus Assembly by themselves."

00:55:28.747 --> 00:55:30.130
MARISHA: Yep, you got that right.

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.312
MATT: "I think I'm racking up a few

00:55:35.837 --> 00:55:38.387
"goals to check off my box, huh?"

00:55:38.387 --> 00:55:39.507
LIAM: What about that book of yours?

00:55:39.507 --> 00:55:42.040
Have you mined it of all its secrets?

00:55:44.917 --> 00:55:45.780
MATT: "Not all of it.

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:52.277
"There's some curious pieces I need to suss out."

00:55:53.587 --> 00:55:56.137
And he glances over in the eastward direction.

00:55:58.447 --> 00:56:00.897
LIAM: I know that trust is stretched a little thin

00:56:00.897 --> 00:56:05.897
around this fire, but we have a couple of eggheads here

00:56:06.027 --> 00:56:07.547
with a--
LAURA: I'm really smart.

00:56:07.547 --> 00:56:09.288
LIAM: -- very good track record.

00:56:09.288 --> 00:56:11.337
SAM: Yeah, we're detectives.

00:56:11.337 --> 00:56:12.437
LIAM: All nine of us.

00:56:12.437 --> 00:56:13.967
TALIESIN: I'll also say that we have something

00:56:13.967 --> 00:56:16.460
that you are clearly in dire need of.

00:56:17.447 --> 00:56:20.687
MATT: "I wouldn't say dire, but certainly convenient need."

00:56:20.687 --> 00:56:22.030
TALIESIN: We have perspective.

00:56:22.882 --> 00:56:25.757
When was the last time that you had anybody who

00:56:26.867 --> 00:56:29.097
didn't just agree with you all the time?

00:56:29.097 --> 00:56:31.147
How are you ever going to work anything out?

00:56:33.527 --> 00:56:38.377
MATT: There is a pause and a stare

00:56:38.377 --> 00:56:40.760
and Lucien leans forward towards you,

00:56:41.637 --> 00:56:45.387
lips pursed in this hard-to-read,

00:56:45.387 --> 00:56:47.757
almost imperceptibly frustrated

00:56:47.757 --> 00:56:50.965
and trying to read you before it curls into a grin.

00:56:53.747 --> 00:56:56.635
"Oh, I know your type." (laughs)

00:56:56.635 --> 00:56:58.237
TALIESIN: I don't think you know my type,

00:56:58.237 --> 00:56:59.975
at least not in a long time.

00:57:03.497 --> 00:57:06.377
MATT: "Oh, this is going to be a fun journey."

00:57:06.377 --> 00:57:07.230
TALIESIN: I think so.

00:57:09.997 --> 00:57:12.750
I'll do my best to be as honest as I possibly can.

00:57:14.227 --> 00:57:18.517
MATT: "I will say, I admire those who can

00:57:18.517 --> 00:57:19.870
"live a life of perspective.

00:57:20.887 --> 00:57:24.997
"Those who can see their choices

00:57:24.997 --> 00:57:26.587
"from the position of their own mind

00:57:26.587 --> 00:57:31.397
"and make those choices accordingly."

00:57:31.397 --> 00:57:33.140
TALIESIN: Oh, you-- you missed the point.

00:57:34.207 --> 00:57:38.890
Perspective doesn't come from yourself; you need others.

00:57:39.757 --> 00:57:42.420
Perspective is disagreement.

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:46.757
You only have two eyes.

00:57:46.757 --> 00:57:48.057
I know you think you have more,

00:57:48.057 --> 00:57:50.415
but there's really only two.

00:57:50.415 --> 00:57:53.015
MATT: He grins and turns his head to the side.

00:57:54.073 --> 00:57:55.014
"(sighs)

00:57:57.047 --> 00:57:58.547
"You've tipped your hand a bit."

00:57:58.547 --> 00:57:59.382
TALIESIN: Eh.

00:57:59.382 --> 00:58:02.767
MATT: "There's a lot you don't understand."

00:58:02.767 --> 00:58:05.037
TALIESIN: I hope so. That's why we're here.

00:58:05.037 --> 00:58:06.800
MATT: "I have plenty of perspective.

00:58:08.945 --> 00:58:11.445
"And just for the sake--"
LIAM: Not for that entire book, though.

00:58:14.757 --> 00:58:16.599
MATT: "Speaking of disagreement,

00:58:19.137 --> 00:58:22.817
"I have the perspective of not just myself,

00:58:22.817 --> 00:58:25.867
"not just these fine companions,

00:58:25.867 --> 00:58:29.107
"nor the perspective of nine,

00:58:29.107 --> 00:58:34.107
"quite frankly, batty as shit individuals

00:58:34.187 --> 00:58:35.630
"from a long time ago.

00:58:38.767 --> 00:58:40.720
"Many, many minds of that period.

00:58:42.157 --> 00:58:44.060
"And there's plenty of disagreement."

00:58:47.507 --> 00:58:48.700
TALIESIN: I'm excited to learn.

00:58:49.827 --> 00:58:53.560
MATT: "Then listen close, and don't get in my way."

00:58:55.047 --> 00:58:58.657
TALIESIN: Just talk. All this is, is just talk.

00:58:58.657 --> 00:59:00.567
MARISHA: What do you have to worry about?

00:59:00.567 --> 00:59:05.397
Are you so afraid of appearing wrong in front of us?

00:59:05.397 --> 00:59:07.637
Who are you trying to impress?

00:59:07.637 --> 00:59:09.567
MATT: "This isn't about impressing.

00:59:09.567 --> 00:59:12.561
"This is about having a conversation."

00:59:12.561 --> 00:59:14.919
MARISHA: Right, and so we're offering you help

00:59:16.736 --> 00:59:19.087
and perspective.

00:59:19.087 --> 00:59:22.539
There's nowhere we can go and nothing we can do.

00:59:22.539 --> 00:59:23.914
TALIESIN: You have too many yes-men.

00:59:23.914 --> 00:59:25.355
It's obviously a problem.
MATT: "And I am extremely

00:59:25.355 --> 00:59:27.967
"appreciative of such an offer.

00:59:27.967 --> 00:59:31.637
"And if I were, I don't know, interested in passing

00:59:31.637 --> 00:59:34.387
"over an extremely important relic

00:59:34.387 --> 00:59:36.977
"that contained all sorts of,

00:59:36.977 --> 00:59:39.817
"well, sensitive information to individuals

00:59:39.817 --> 00:59:44.677
"that honestly refuse to give over

00:59:44.677 --> 00:59:46.757
"any of the things that is rightfully ours,

00:59:46.757 --> 00:59:49.950
"that we asked for very nicely--

00:59:52.017 --> 00:59:54.460
"I think maybe our trust needs to grow a little bigger."

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:57.117
LIAM: Why don't we make it an exchange?

00:59:57.117 --> 00:59:59.997
If you let my friend and I examine your book,

00:59:59.997 --> 01:00:02.257
we will uncover the last of it for you.

01:00:02.257 --> 01:00:03.357
I wager we will.

01:00:04.218 --> 01:00:06.390
And you can have your threshold crest.

01:00:08.507 --> 01:00:12.937
MATT: "Maybe. After all, we still have a few more days

01:00:12.937 --> 01:00:13.920
"of travel to take.

01:00:14.757 --> 01:00:19.757
"Let's see how this friendship blossoms."

01:00:19.927 --> 01:00:21.117
TRAVIS: Caduceus, pay attention.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:24.557
Do you need us outside of your threshold crest

01:00:24.557 --> 01:00:25.900
to achieve your goals?

01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:28.469
MATT: "No."

01:00:28.469 --> 01:00:30.177
TRAVIS: Do I believe him?

01:00:30.177 --> 01:00:33.527
MATT: Make an insight check.
MARISHA: "Caduceus, pay attention." (laughs)

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:35.717
TALIESIN: I didn't know what you were talking about

01:00:35.717 --> 01:00:36.557
when you said pay attention,

01:00:36.557 --> 01:00:38.528
so I immediately shifted my focus to you.

01:00:38.528 --> 01:00:41.293
(laughter)

01:00:41.293 --> 01:00:42.717
TALIESIN: I assume I had disadvantage?

01:00:42.717 --> 01:00:43.986
MATT: Yes.
TALIESIN: I rolled a one.

01:00:43.986 --> 01:00:47.561
(laughter)

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:49.873
TALIESIN: You seem to believe what you're saying.

01:00:49.873 --> 01:00:52.887
(laughter)

01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:54.557
LAURA: Can you roll yourself, too, or--?

01:00:54.557 --> 01:00:56.487
MATT: No, he said he was going to assist him.

01:00:56.487 --> 01:00:58.713
Well no, you said-- sorry, you roll for yourself, then.

01:00:58.713 --> 01:01:00.087
Because he did roll at disadvantage for himself.

01:01:00.087 --> 01:01:00.920
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.097
MATT: Because you did ask the question.
TRAVIS: My insight checks are so good

01:01:04.097 --> 01:01:06.397
with this negative two for a five.

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:07.597
TALIESIN: Better than mine.
MATT: Yeah.

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:10.257
TALIESIN: Actually, not better than mine, to be fair.

01:01:10.257 --> 01:01:12.090
MATT: Yeah, so.
TALIESIN: Mine's a nine with that,

01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:14.432
but we'll let that go.
MATT: I mean, he's a slippery figure in general.

01:01:14.432 --> 01:01:15.855
TRAVIS: Totally.

01:01:15.855 --> 01:01:17.746
That was not a check made for me.
TALIESIN: Shit.

01:01:17.746 --> 01:01:19.437
(laughter)

01:01:19.437 --> 01:01:22.197
TALIESIN: Good call.
MATT: Good call, though, good call.

01:01:22.197 --> 01:01:23.557
TALIESIN: Tomorrow night.

01:01:23.557 --> 01:01:26.447
ASHLEY: Do we-- who has Molly's coat?

01:01:26.447 --> 01:01:28.604
Is it in the bag of--?
LAURA, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: I think you do.

01:01:28.604 --> 01:01:29.437
ASHLEY: I might have it, yeah.

01:01:29.437 --> 01:01:31.414
MARISHA: I have his belt.

01:01:31.414 --> 01:01:33.297
I think you have his c-- I think we gave it to you

01:01:33.297 --> 01:01:35.280
when you got back.
SAM: We dress up Lucien as Molly

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.901
and just see if that does it?

01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:38.197
(laughter)

01:01:38.197 --> 01:01:39.497
ASHLEY: Bring him back?
SAM: Yeah.

01:01:40.537 --> 01:01:42.677
TALIESIN: Trying to assemble him like a Voltron.

01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:45.537
LIAM: I've got some eggs.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

01:01:45.537 --> 01:01:46.524
TRAVIS: We start trying to pull his coat off.

01:01:46.524 --> 01:01:47.580
Keep your coat on!

01:01:52.057 --> 01:01:53.398
MARISHA: All right, well,

01:01:55.273 --> 01:01:56.831
we'll be here in the morning, right?

01:01:56.831 --> 01:01:58.317
Because we can't go anywhere.

01:01:58.317 --> 01:02:01.227
You can melt people by looking at them, so.

01:02:01.227 --> 01:02:02.060
LIAM: Yeah.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.710
MATT: "Well, only if they get uppity."

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.277
SAM: So can we. We can melt people by looking at them,

01:02:08.277 --> 01:02:09.420
we just haven't shown you yet.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.753
TALIESIN: We can?

01:02:10.753 --> 01:02:12.247
MATT: "I'm sure.

01:02:12.247 --> 01:02:15.577
"Well, you all look a bit tired."

01:02:15.577 --> 01:02:17.017
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Mm.

01:02:17.017 --> 01:02:17.917
MATT: "Let's get some rest.

01:02:17.917 --> 01:02:18.757
LIAM: Sure, sleep on it.

01:02:18.757 --> 01:02:21.347
Think about those last two chapters you can't crack.

01:02:21.347 --> 01:02:22.180
Good night.

01:02:24.127 --> 01:02:28.017
MARISHA: Yasha, let's go and look at the lava real quick.

01:02:28.017 --> 01:02:28.990
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:30.167
ASHLEY: I wanted to see it anyway.

01:02:30.167 --> 01:02:31.108
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

01:02:31.108 --> 01:02:33.099
Get a better look at this.
ASHLEY: Yeah, get a better look.

01:02:33.099 --> 01:02:34.432
LAURA: Have fun, you guys.

01:02:34.432 --> 01:02:36.349
MARISHA: Thanks.
ASHLEY: Okay, well, stay safe.

01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:40.080
LIAM: Do you remember our first date by the lava flow?

01:02:42.127 --> 01:02:44.067
MARISHA: So I was kind of banking on having

01:02:44.067 --> 01:02:47.937
Caleb's tower, you know?

01:02:47.937 --> 01:02:49.857
ASHLEY: I was already-- yeah.

01:02:49.857 --> 01:02:54.527
MARISHA: Yeah, and not, like, 12 other people around us.

01:02:54.527 --> 01:02:55.907
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel like that would make

01:02:55.907 --> 01:02:59.247
for a very interesting first date.

01:02:59.247 --> 01:03:00.167
MARISHA: That'd be uncomfortable.

01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:03.260
ASHLEY: But I think I would rather wait for something,

01:03:05.117 --> 01:03:08.977
I don't know, not this.

01:03:08.977 --> 01:03:10.697
MARISHA: Not anxiety inducing?

01:03:10.697 --> 01:03:12.787
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:12.787 --> 01:03:14.527
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: This is weird.

01:03:14.527 --> 01:03:15.817
MARISHA: A hundred percent weird.

01:03:15.817 --> 01:03:17.157
ASHLEY: I don't know how to talk to him.

01:03:17.157 --> 01:03:19.452
MARISHA: I don't know either, I hate him.

01:03:19.452 --> 01:03:21.789
ASHLEY: Yeah, I kind of do, but at the same time,

01:03:23.289 --> 01:03:25.257
I want him back.

01:03:25.257 --> 01:03:30.257
MARISHA: It's frustrating because
you can see that one percent of him,

01:03:30.267 --> 01:03:32.927
that ten percent of him that is that piece of Molly.

01:03:32.927 --> 01:03:34.367
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:03:34.367 --> 01:03:36.277
MARISHA: So it's like, you can see this version of him

01:03:36.277 --> 01:03:39.900
that's better and good and not corrupted by--

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:44.171
well, I was going to say greed and arrogance,

01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:47.554
but arrogance was always Molly's thing. It's fine.
ASHLEY: Already there, it was already there.

01:03:47.554 --> 01:03:48.387
MARISHA: But--
ASHLEY: But it was cute.

01:03:48.387 --> 01:03:49.877
MARISHA: It was cute. It was endearing.

01:03:49.877 --> 01:03:50.857
He had charming arrogance.

01:03:50.857 --> 01:03:53.287
ASHLEY: Yeah. This is a little different.

01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:54.120
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:55.677 --> 01:03:58.697
ASHLEY: I think we should put a pin in it.

01:03:58.697 --> 01:03:59.530
MARISHA: Okay.

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:03.307
ASHLEY: And let's stay alert and please

01:04:05.317 --> 01:04:06.727
don't die in the meantime.

01:04:06.727 --> 01:04:08.107
MARISHA: Don't die.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:04:08.107 --> 01:04:09.867
MARISHA: Next time we have the tower.

01:04:09.867 --> 01:04:11.537
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:04:11.537 --> 01:04:12.587
ASHLEY: That's a plan.

01:04:14.307 --> 01:04:15.390
MARISHA: Shake on it.

01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:21.165
(laughter)

01:04:21.165 --> 01:04:22.937
ASHLEY: I kick some snow into the lava.

01:04:22.937 --> 01:04:24.947
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

01:04:24.947 --> 01:04:26.487
ASHLEY: It just floats.

01:04:26.487 --> 01:04:29.889
MARISHA: Or maybe we can build, like, a raft, a snow raft.

01:04:29.889 --> 01:04:30.787
ASHLEY: We should just build a raft

01:04:30.787 --> 01:04:33.327
and then leave right now, you and me.

01:04:33.327 --> 01:04:35.987
MARISHA: Okay!
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding.

01:04:35.987 --> 01:04:38.845
MARISHA: That's a good idea though. It's a very inviting.

01:04:41.017 --> 01:04:42.046
ASHLEY: Let's go protect.
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:42.957
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah yeah, let's go.

01:04:42.957 --> 01:04:44.127
MATT: Okay.

01:04:44.127 --> 01:04:46.931
SAM: As she comes back, I'm going to grab Yasha.

01:04:46.931 --> 01:04:48.647
Can we go to the edge of the lava?

01:04:48.647 --> 01:04:49.486
Just you and me?

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:50.793
(laughter)

01:04:50.793 --> 01:04:53.925
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, sure, let's go.

01:04:53.925 --> 01:04:58.867
MARISHA: I just squint at Veth as they walk by.

01:05:00.557 --> 01:05:03.831
SAM: This is not how I pictured tonight going.

01:05:03.831 --> 01:05:05.287
(laughter)

01:05:05.287 --> 01:05:06.304
LAURA: Such an asshole.

01:05:06.304 --> 01:05:07.517
(laughter)

01:05:07.517 --> 01:05:09.747
SAM: Thought we had a bit more--
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

01:05:09.747 --> 01:05:13.307
SAM: I had a plan to do something really nice for you,

01:05:13.307 --> 01:05:17.883
really special, and have a one-on-one moment and--

01:05:17.883 --> 01:05:20.729
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean.
SAM: It just didn't happen.

01:05:20.729 --> 01:05:23.297
ASHLEY: It's okay, I think-- you know what?

01:05:23.297 --> 01:05:25.417
We'll make sure to do it at another time.

01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:27.267
SAM: No, I think I can do it now.

01:05:27.267 --> 01:05:28.503
ASHLEY: Oh!
SAM: I wrote you a poem.

01:05:30.261 --> 01:05:32.557
ASHLEY: Oh, no one's ever written me a poem before.

01:05:32.557 --> 01:05:35.294
SAM: Yeah, I thought, you know,

01:05:35.294 --> 01:05:37.257
you've just been so distant from us.

01:05:37.257 --> 01:05:39.147
I would just want to make sure that you know

01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:40.477
that you're a part of the team

01:05:40.477 --> 01:05:42.700
and part of the family and so.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.377
ASHLEY: Veth, that's so sweet.

01:05:44.377 --> 01:05:47.307
SAM: Well, you know, I do what I can.

01:05:47.307 --> 01:05:49.807
ASHLEY: Should I?
SAM: You can sit.

01:05:49.807 --> 01:05:52.397
ASHLEY: I'll sit, yeah yeah.
SAM: Yeah? (laughs)

01:05:52.397 --> 01:05:53.407
ASHLEY: I'll bunch up some snow.

01:05:53.407 --> 01:05:54.477
SAM: It's not very long.

01:05:54.477 --> 01:05:57.320
I had to write it while we were walking today.

01:05:58.547 --> 01:06:00.817
It was really hard to write while you walk.

01:06:00.817 --> 01:06:02.967
ASHLEY: Yeah, of course. It gets all weird, I've tried it.

01:06:02.967 --> 01:06:05.127
SAM: The rhyme scheme kind of falls apart, whatever.

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.347
ASHLEY: No, no, no, it's fine.

01:06:06.347 --> 01:06:09.247
SAM: Big, bold, brave Yasha,

01:06:09.247 --> 01:06:12.535
hair so long, like yummy pasta.

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.637
(laughter)

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.440
Sturdy as the Cauldron of Tasha.

01:06:18.287 --> 01:06:20.390
If you're dirty, we will wash ya.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:24.537
If you cross her, it will cost ya.

01:06:24.537 --> 01:06:27.167
We'd be sad if we ever lost ya.

01:06:28.227 --> 01:06:29.060
ASHLEY: Aww.

01:06:31.777 --> 01:06:34.351
I scoop her up and I give her a big hug.

01:06:34.351 --> 01:06:36.643
MATT: Aww. (laughs)

01:06:36.643 --> 01:06:38.457
ASHLEY: Veth, that's so nice, thank you.

01:06:38.457 --> 01:06:40.137
SAM: Well, you know, I just thought

01:06:40.137 --> 01:06:42.157
that you needed to hear it from someone

01:06:42.157 --> 01:06:44.646
because no one's going to tell you you're special out here

01:06:44.646 --> 01:06:47.970
on these, you know, horrible wastelands.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:50.877
No one's going to just look in your eyes

01:06:50.877 --> 01:06:54.806
and say, "Hey you, I like you."

01:06:56.297 --> 01:06:58.357
ASHLEY: Thank you, Veth.

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:00.817
May I keep this?

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:02.767
SAM: Of course. Yeah, yeah.

01:07:02.767 --> 01:07:05.164
ASHLEY: This is very special.

01:07:05.164 --> 01:07:08.458
I'm going to put it in my flower journal.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:09.647
MATT: Okay.

01:07:09.647 --> 01:07:11.767
SAM: And just remember I was the first person

01:07:11.767 --> 01:07:13.627
to ever write you a poem.

01:07:13.627 --> 01:07:15.977
ASHLEY: I will always remember it.

01:07:15.977 --> 01:07:19.584
Thank you so much, Veth, I will always remember it.

01:07:19.584 --> 01:07:20.487
SAM: All right.

01:07:20.487 --> 01:07:22.687
ASHLEY: (stammering) We'll-- We will, we will.

01:07:22.687 --> 01:07:23.817
SAM: We'll do something more special.

01:07:23.817 --> 01:07:25.254
Let's put a pin in this.

01:07:25.254 --> 01:07:26.296
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's a good idea.

01:07:26.296 --> 01:07:27.129
SAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Let's do that.

01:07:27.129 --> 01:07:28.777
SAM: Yeah, we'll do a proper something.

01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:30.537
ASHLEY: A proper something something
SAM: Okay.

01:07:30.537 --> 01:07:32.037
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm in.

01:07:32.037 --> 01:07:33.347
Okay.
SAM: All right.

01:07:33.347 --> 01:07:34.469
Shake on it.

01:07:34.469 --> 01:07:37.007
(laughter)

01:07:37.007 --> 01:07:39.333
ASHLEY: Let's shake up. Yeah.

01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:40.669
SAM: Great.
LAURA: Such a dick.

01:07:40.669 --> 01:07:41.953
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Fucking troll.

01:07:41.953 --> 01:07:44.617
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh my god.

01:07:44.617 --> 01:07:45.767
SAM: We'll walk back.
MATT: Okay

01:07:48.547 --> 01:07:49.380
All right.

01:07:50.387 --> 01:07:51.650
TRAVIS: Masterful.
SAM: What?

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:54.039
MATT: So how are you guys resting?
MARISHA: What are you doing

01:07:54.039 --> 01:07:55.934
SAM: What you want to go talk about it next to the lava?

01:07:55.934 --> 01:07:58.887
(laughter)

01:07:58.887 --> 01:08:03.270
LIAM: If I were to throw up any sort of thing for warmth,

01:08:04.327 --> 01:08:06.420
is that going to be a problem or are we good?

01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:08.817
SAM: Are you asking Lucien?

01:08:08.817 --> 01:08:10.467
LIAM: Yeah, I'm looking right at him.

01:08:11.627 --> 01:08:16.147
MATT: "No, I mean, warmth is a quite necessary out here."

01:08:16.147 --> 01:08:19.094
LIAM: Okay. You guys are going to be good?

01:08:20.887 --> 01:08:22.720
MATT: "I think we'll be fine."
LIAM: Okay.

01:08:27.047 --> 01:08:28.197
I walk a little ways off

01:08:28.197 --> 01:08:31.153
towards where I saw everyone kept going back and forth to

01:08:31.153 --> 01:08:32.237
over by the lava flow.

01:08:32.237 --> 01:08:34.527
And I begin to ritually cast the dome there.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:35.894
MATT: You've got it. Okay.

01:08:38.507 --> 01:08:39.340
Eventually--

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.987
LAURA: I'm sorry. Just out of curiosity, have any of us--

01:08:41.987 --> 01:08:46.077
or rather, have I-- ever heard of the Claret Order?

01:08:46.077 --> 01:08:47.257
MATT: Make a history check.
TRAVIS: Yeah, how do you spell that?

01:08:47.257 --> 01:08:49.047
SAM: Yeah, any of those names?
LIAM: Claret.

01:08:49.047 --> 01:08:51.499
MATT: C-L-A, yeah. It's spelled claret.

01:08:51.499 --> 01:08:54.143
TRAVIS: Oh, that one.
MATT: Yeah.

01:08:54.143 --> 01:08:55.497
LIAM: Claret, that's how it's spelled.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:57.201
SAM: Wait, you know that name?

01:08:57.201 --> 01:09:00.440
TRAVIS: I mean, I've read the Tal'Dorei Campaign Guide.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.627
LAURA: Exactly, like we know personally, but.

01:09:02.627 --> 01:09:05.449
SAM: I try not to spoil this.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:05.449 --> 01:09:08.300
TRAVIS: No, that's from the-- It doesn't matter.

01:09:09.527 --> 01:09:12.907
LAURA: Well, my history is dogshit, but 16.

01:09:12.907 --> 01:09:17.907
MATT: 16. You've heard a couple of stories.

01:09:17.967 --> 01:09:21.497
They talk about-- for Nicodranas specifically--

01:09:21.497 --> 01:09:23.347
probably a little more like boogeymen.

01:09:24.347 --> 01:09:28.077
It's supposedly a group of odd outsider warriors

01:09:28.077 --> 01:09:29.627
that deal with dark magic.

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:33.027
And there are some stories that tell them helping people

01:09:33.027 --> 01:09:36.007
when certain monsters arise

01:09:36.007 --> 01:09:39.157
and some saying that they are the monsters themselves,

01:09:39.157 --> 01:09:43.707
but most of the tales end with the general idea of just

01:09:43.707 --> 01:09:45.117
don't go near them.

01:09:45.117 --> 01:09:46.990
They're weird and probably not good,

01:09:48.147 --> 01:09:51.590
but it's just, like, I don't know, a guild or a club.

01:09:52.757 --> 01:09:53.590
LAURA: Okay.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:56.267
MATT: It's about the best that you can make out with memory.

01:10:01.647 --> 01:10:03.490
TRAVIS: They've got a really cool symbol, too.

01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:06.437
MATT: Anybody else would like to do anything

01:10:06.437 --> 01:10:09.041
or are you going to rest down for the night?

01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:10.855
TRAVIS: We're in the dome, yes?

01:10:12.117 --> 01:10:16.277
One, two open per shift, yes?

01:10:16.277 --> 01:10:18.797
TALIESIN: I don't even know if
we need to shift at this point.

01:10:18.797 --> 01:10:19.977
SAM: Yeah, someone's got to stay up.

01:10:19.977 --> 01:10:21.987
What if they leave or kill us?
ASHLEY: I can take the first shift.

01:10:21.987 --> 01:10:23.117
TALIESIN: Why haven't they done it yet?

01:10:23.117 --> 01:10:24.217
In fact, it'd be way easier

01:10:24.217 --> 01:10:26.559
to kill us an hour ago.
SAM: I'll stay up first, it's fine.

01:10:26.559 --> 01:10:27.609
LIAM: I'll stay up, too.

01:10:27.609 --> 01:10:30.137
MARISHA: We should let the spellcasters sleep, dear gods.

01:10:30.137 --> 01:10:31.587
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I can take a second watch.

01:10:31.587 --> 01:10:34.137
Wake me up when you're done.

01:10:34.137 --> 01:10:36.607
TALIESIN: Try and wake us up 10 minutes before the--

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:37.857
LAURA: Does it seem like they're laying down

01:10:37.857 --> 01:10:39.667
to go to sleep at all out there?

01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:40.947
MATT: Yeah, everyone's bedding down

01:10:40.947 --> 01:10:43.047
and gathering up around their little fire.

01:10:44.232 --> 01:10:45.967
Who's taking first watch?

01:10:45.967 --> 01:10:47.657
All right, perception check from both of you,

01:10:47.657 --> 01:10:49.163
if you don't mind.

01:10:49.163 --> 01:10:50.871
SAM: Disadvantage.
MATT: At disadvantage.

01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:51.888
LIAM: Where's my twenties?

01:10:51.888 --> 01:10:53.683
Oh, at disadvantage, right.

01:10:55.137 --> 01:10:57.054
Balls.
SAM: Six.

01:10:57.054 --> 01:10:57.887
LIAM: 12.

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:00.367
MATT: 12. Somewhat uneventful.

01:11:00.367 --> 01:11:01.630
I mean, the sky's clear.

01:11:03.207 --> 01:11:04.617
You know, occasionally the clouds come through

01:11:04.617 --> 01:11:06.537
and occasionally you can glance them see bits of the stars

01:11:06.537 --> 01:11:09.920
poking through in the distant, dark void of the night sky.

01:11:11.147 --> 01:11:14.547
The fire right next to the Tomb Takers

01:11:14.547 --> 01:11:17.117
begins to dwindle slightly into a warm ember,

01:11:17.117 --> 01:11:19.284
but they're all mostly resting, except for Lucien,

01:11:19.284 --> 01:11:21.547
who's just leaning against a rock

01:11:21.547 --> 01:11:23.550
and looking in your direction.

01:11:25.367 --> 01:11:27.898
LIAM: While we're having our watch,

01:11:27.898 --> 01:11:29.680
Caleb has taken out

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:34.807
the collar from inside of the Folding Halls of Halas

01:11:34.807 --> 01:11:36.297
and that power source.

01:11:36.297 --> 01:11:39.167
And I'm just going to start to, while talking to Veth,

01:11:39.167 --> 01:11:41.467
but just try to examine them,

01:11:41.467 --> 01:11:44.197
see if the two things seem compatible,

01:11:44.197 --> 01:11:46.324
begin the study of these things.

01:11:46.324 --> 01:11:47.807
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:11:47.807 --> 01:11:49.377
LIAM: At disadvantage.
MATT: Yes.

01:11:49.377 --> 01:11:51.304
LIAM: Yeah.

01:11:51.304 --> 01:11:55.896
(groans) Well, they're both really low rolls. 15.

01:11:57.927 --> 01:12:00.387
MATT: There might be a way,
but there's just so much swimming

01:12:00.387 --> 01:12:02.327
in your head right now from the conversations earlier,

01:12:02.327 --> 01:12:04.627
the possibilities, some of the things that Lucien said

01:12:04.627 --> 01:12:07.557
and trying-- just a lot in your mind

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:09.797
trying to occupy that space, and you

01:12:09.797 --> 01:12:11.597
you can't find the concentration tonight

01:12:11.597 --> 01:12:12.887
to really put it together.

01:12:12.887 --> 01:12:14.120
LIAM: Perfect.

01:12:15.103 --> 01:12:17.645
You know, I'm

01:12:17.645 --> 01:12:19.319
having trouble with this.

01:12:20.197 --> 01:12:22.317
I think mainly because I'm feeling

01:12:23.346 --> 01:12:26.481
(sighs) guilty, Veth.

01:12:26.481 --> 01:12:31.045
SAM: Guilty about what?

01:12:34.607 --> 01:12:37.957
LIAM: I can't help but feel like I talked to you out here.

01:12:37.957 --> 01:12:38.790
SAM: Oh.

01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:41.257
LIAM: I told you I had a place
for you to stay with your family.

01:12:41.257 --> 01:12:43.337
And I told you I could get you back to your family.

01:12:43.337 --> 01:12:45.567
And we are stuck out here on the edge

01:12:45.567 --> 01:12:47.887
of nowhere with no way out.

01:12:47.887 --> 01:12:49.230
And we're heading towards some sort of--

01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:51.927
SAM: No, no, no, I mean, that's not your--

01:12:51.927 --> 01:12:55.457
you have plenty to feel guilty about in your life

01:12:55.457 --> 01:12:58.937
without, you know, adding that to it.

01:12:58.937 --> 01:13:02.707
Listen, deep down inside, you know,

01:13:02.707 --> 01:13:04.587
I wanted you to talk me into it.

01:13:04.587 --> 01:13:07.258
I want to be with you all.

01:13:08.223 --> 01:13:11.227
And I feel more guilt than you could ever know about this.

01:13:11.227 --> 01:13:13.707
I mean, if I don't go home,

01:13:13.707 --> 01:13:17.407
my son grows up without a mother.

01:13:17.407 --> 01:13:20.397
My husband has to find a new wife

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:23.655
and he has <i>no</i> game.

01:13:23.655 --> 01:13:26.747
(laughter)

01:13:26.747 --> 01:13:27.580
LIAM: He's sweet, though.

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:32.377
SAM: He's very sweet, but like woof, but.

01:13:32.377 --> 01:13:33.517
MATT: I grok that.

01:13:34.987 --> 01:13:36.870
SAM: But... (laughs)

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:38.428
MARISHA: Aw!

01:13:39.591 --> 01:13:41.010
LIAM: It took me a second.
MATT: I wouldn't be better.

01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:43.797
SAM: But I wanted to come.

01:13:43.797 --> 01:13:45.177
I wanted to be here.

01:13:45.177 --> 01:13:50.177
And frankly, you know, we haven't had time

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:54.838
for it, but, you know,

01:13:54.838 --> 01:13:58.307
I've felt awful about it as well.

01:13:58.307 --> 01:14:01.494
It's like I can't be here for all of you fully

01:14:02.867 --> 01:14:06.717
and be there for them fully.

01:14:06.717 --> 01:14:09.017
It's like I'm in two places at the same time

01:14:10.207 --> 01:14:14.350
mentally, and it's impossible, so.

01:14:15.357 --> 01:14:18.590
LIAM: You're not doing very-- the guilt is still.

01:14:19.667 --> 01:14:23.687
You know, I've grown so accustomed to having you at my side.

01:14:23.687 --> 01:14:25.660
It's been a long time

01:14:28.027 --> 01:14:30.217
and I just didn't want to leave you behind.

01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:33.480
I don't really function

01:14:34.797 --> 01:14:36.820
on my own so much.

01:14:38.168 --> 01:14:41.399
SAM: I mean, I don't think any of us really do.

01:14:42.798 --> 01:14:47.640
When Lucien was talking about how

01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:52.676
his spirit was split into parts

01:14:52.676 --> 01:14:54.948
and scattered asunder,

01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:59.288
just made me think about us, the Nein.

01:14:59.288 --> 01:15:03.268
About how, when we all started, that's how we were;

01:15:03.268 --> 01:15:06.468
disparate parts of people

01:15:07.368 --> 01:15:10.538
and it took us coming together to feel whole again.

01:15:10.538 --> 01:15:14.841
I feel bad for the guy because I know what that's like.

01:15:16.728 --> 01:15:21.278
And if I left you all, if you left us all,

01:15:21.278 --> 01:15:24.038
it just wouldn't be the same.

01:15:24.038 --> 01:15:25.548
So I don't know how to...

01:15:26.398 --> 01:15:28.138
I don't know how to square it for any of us

01:15:28.138 --> 01:15:32.911
because this journey will come to an end at some point and--

01:15:34.179 --> 01:15:36.481
LIAM: Yeah, I've got a bad feeling about that.

01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:38.923
SAM: I don't want it to.

01:15:40.278 --> 01:15:42.338
LIAM: This makes me nervous.

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:44.628
SAM: But him looking at you like that that's--

01:15:44.628 --> 01:15:45.628
LIAM: That doesn't help.

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:52.835
I've been so wrapped up in my own bullshit for so long.

01:15:52.835 --> 01:15:54.708
And this is clearly something bigger than all of us,

01:15:54.708 --> 01:15:57.091
bigger than them, bigger than he.

01:15:58.728 --> 01:16:02.145
SAM: Thank you for using the proper grammar.

01:16:09.668 --> 01:16:11.668
LIAM: I feel like it's going to be threading a needle

01:16:11.668 --> 01:16:15.523
to come out the other side of this, all of us, any of us.

01:16:16.758 --> 01:16:17.908
SAM: Well, and then the worst part

01:16:17.908 --> 01:16:19.578
is if we come out the other side

01:16:19.578 --> 01:16:24.491
and we survive or win or whatever it is,

01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:28.484
then it's goodbye.

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:35.601
LIAM: I don't want to think about that.

01:16:37.578 --> 01:16:38.698
SAM: Well then, good.

01:16:38.698 --> 01:16:43.188
Think about your guilt and I'll think about mine.

01:16:43.188 --> 01:16:44.021
LIAM: Check.

01:16:45.896 --> 01:16:47.396
SAM: And that'll keep us company.

01:16:49.201 --> 01:16:50.618
LIAM: I just pull into a hug.

01:16:53.835 --> 01:16:55.109
I love you.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:57.331
SAM: I will always love you.

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:03.251
LIAM: Thank you, I'm sorry, thank you.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.098
(chuckles) What a mess!

01:17:09.098 --> 01:17:10.548
We should wake up the others.

01:17:12.218 --> 01:17:14.461
MATT: Okay, who's taking the next watch?

01:17:15.608 --> 01:17:17.541
ASHLEY: I can take next watch.

01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:18.499
SAM: Hey, Yasha?

01:17:18.499 --> 01:17:19.332
MARISHA: Are you good?

01:17:19.332 --> 01:17:20.958
LAURA: Yeah, I can do it, I can take over.

01:17:20.958 --> 01:17:22.908
SAM: Yasha, Jester?
LAURA: Huh?

01:17:22.908 --> 01:17:25.074
SAM: We forgot to look--

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:29.908
Look for our wheeled friend, maybe.

01:17:29.908 --> 01:17:33.118
Maybe just scan the horizon or something, good night.

01:17:33.118 --> 01:17:34.218
ASHLEY: Good night.

01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:37.598
LIAM: Here, here, wait, hold this.

01:17:37.598 --> 01:17:40.288
I just put a cat in her hands and I go to sleep.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:43.158
ASHLEY: Oh!

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.596
It's making biscuits.

01:17:44.596 --> 01:17:46.118
(chuckling)

01:17:46.118 --> 01:17:48.018
Hello.
LAURA: I hate being awake.

01:17:48.018 --> 01:17:50.148
ASHLEY: I do, too.
I don't like being woken up.

01:17:50.148 --> 01:17:51.084
LAURA: Me neither.

01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:53.959
ASHLEY: I just hate it, but I knew--

01:17:53.959 --> 01:17:55.736
LAURA: I crawl over some bodies,

01:17:55.736 --> 01:17:57.508
sit next to Yasha.

01:17:57.508 --> 01:17:58.911
LIAM: No.
LAURA: Sorry.

01:18:00.486 --> 01:18:01.319
TRAVIS: (fart noise)

01:18:04.108 --> 01:18:05.381
MARISHA: Not in the dome.
ASHLEY: How are you?

01:18:05.381 --> 01:18:08.921
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Yeah. (whooshing)

01:18:08.921 --> 01:18:10.287
LIAM: ♪ Hot Pocket! ♪

01:18:11.798 --> 01:18:13.161
TALIESIN: Roll a-- Hold on, oh, no.

01:18:13.161 --> 01:18:16.038
ASHLEY: How are you feeling with all this?

01:18:16.038 --> 01:18:19.248
LAURA: Oh, this is awful.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:18:19.248 --> 01:18:21.648
LAURA: How are you and Beau doing? I saw you guys talking.

01:18:23.938 --> 01:18:27.032
ASHLEY: Well, she asked me out on a date.

01:18:27.032 --> 01:18:28.508
LAURA: (gasps)

01:18:28.508 --> 01:18:29.608
She what?

01:18:29.608 --> 01:18:32.628
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, she asked me out on a date.

01:18:32.628 --> 01:18:37.628
And we were going to go tonight in the tower--

01:18:37.748 --> 01:18:38.930
LAURA: Oh no!

01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:41.028
ASHLEY: But it's okay, there's a lot going on right now

01:18:41.028 --> 01:18:46.028
and we have to focus on

01:18:46.036 --> 01:18:47.227
keeping everybody safe

01:18:47.227 --> 01:18:50.758
and making sure that the world doesn't end, you know?

01:18:50.758 --> 01:18:54.998
LAURA: Yeah. That's obviously the most important, yeah.

01:18:54.998 --> 01:18:56.418
ASHLEY: First and foremost.

01:18:56.418 --> 01:18:58.558
LAURA: But did you give her the poem?

01:18:58.558 --> 01:19:01.008
ASHLEY: Well, I was working on it

01:19:01.008 --> 01:19:06.008
and then I just I ended up writing her letter.

01:19:06.098 --> 01:19:07.418
I still have a poem,

01:19:07.418 --> 01:19:12.418
but I just ended up writing her a letter.

01:19:12.538 --> 01:19:17.298
It felt weird and it felt like really I wasn't ready yet.

01:19:17.298 --> 01:19:22.148
So I just wrote her a note and yeah,

01:19:22.148 --> 01:19:25.586
and then she asked me out on a date, yeah.

01:19:26.818 --> 01:19:27.888
I feel like...

01:19:31.808 --> 01:19:36.458
I feel like I saw you and Fjord getting

01:19:36.458 --> 01:19:40.341
very, like, drapey with each other.

01:19:40.341 --> 01:19:41.388
LAURA: Drapey?

01:19:41.388 --> 01:19:45.578
ASHLEY: Just like when we were
sleeping the other night, you guys--

01:19:45.578 --> 01:19:47.269
drapey.

01:19:47.269 --> 01:19:49.427
LAURA: Yasha!
ASHLEY: What?

01:19:52.648 --> 01:19:54.446
LAURA: He kissed me!

01:19:54.446 --> 01:19:57.399
(laughter)

01:19:57.399 --> 01:19:58.240
ASHLEY: What?

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.690
LAURA: I know!

01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:01.095
ASHLEY: And?!

01:20:01.095 --> 01:20:02.458
LAURA: And it was awesome!

01:20:03.503 --> 01:20:06.448
ASHLEY: Have you kissed somebody before?

01:20:06.448 --> 01:20:09.068
LAURA: Well, only Fjord, really,

01:20:09.068 --> 01:20:10.918
underwater, so I don't think it counts.

01:20:10.918 --> 01:20:13.408
I thought they counted, but I don't think it counts.

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:15.358
ASHLEY: What did you feel? What did it feel like?

01:20:15.358 --> 01:20:16.728
Was it wonderful?

01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:20.247
LAURA: You know those butterflies
that keep appearing around us?

01:20:20.247 --> 01:20:22.330
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: It felt a lot like that.

01:20:22.330 --> 01:20:24.478
ASHLEY: Maybe they flew out of your stomach.

01:20:24.478 --> 01:20:26.603
LAURA: I think I've been holding them inside.

01:20:26.603 --> 01:20:27.436
ASHLEY: I think--

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:29.690
LIAM: (fart sound)

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:30.857
ASHLEY: How wonderful!

01:20:33.388 --> 01:20:34.808
Was it romantic?

01:20:34.808 --> 01:20:36.111
LAURA: It pretty romantic.

01:20:37.168 --> 01:20:38.691
ASHLEY: How do you feel about him?

01:20:39.678 --> 01:20:40.511
LAURA: I mean.

01:20:45.694 --> 01:20:49.627
It kind of feels different than I thought it would

01:20:49.627 --> 01:20:51.780
after all of the books that I read, you know?

01:20:52.758 --> 01:20:56.841
Like, it feels like

01:20:56.841 --> 01:21:00.374
like we know each other really well, you know.

01:21:00.374 --> 01:21:01.618
In all those books that I read,

01:21:01.618 --> 01:21:04.818
it's two strangers coming together

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:08.488
and forging this passionate affair.

01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:11.018
And it doesn't feel like that.

01:21:11.018 --> 01:21:13.150
It feels like...

01:21:15.858 --> 01:21:19.288
It feels comfortable instead.

01:21:22.038 --> 01:21:23.814
But in a good way.

01:21:26.668 --> 01:21:30.501
ASHLEY: Well, from my experience,

01:21:30.501 --> 01:21:33.809
which is not a lot,

01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:38.890
I've found that

01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:41.916
the passion and the love for somebody

01:21:41.916 --> 01:21:46.916
is stronger the more you know them

01:21:47.538 --> 01:21:48.978
and the more you love them.

01:21:48.978 --> 01:21:52.828
And I've read books,

01:21:52.828 --> 01:21:55.631
but I don't feel like it's ever really like that.

01:21:55.631 --> 01:21:56.464
LAURA: Yeah.

01:21:56.464 --> 01:21:57.297
ASHLEY: It's--

01:21:59.701 --> 01:22:01.359
It's better.

01:22:03.648 --> 01:22:07.098
But I'm excited for you.

01:22:07.098 --> 01:22:08.595
LAURA: I'm excited for you.

01:22:08.595 --> 01:22:10.688
ASHLEY: Wow. I can't believe he kissed you.

01:22:10.688 --> 01:22:12.091
Did he slip you the tongue?

01:22:13.369 --> 01:22:14.901
LAURA: The teeniest bit.
ASHLEY: Just the tip.

01:22:17.412 --> 01:22:19.448
Wow!

01:22:19.448 --> 01:22:20.648
LAURA: I'm going to wait to kiss him again

01:22:20.648 --> 01:22:22.278
until everything dies down, though.

01:22:22.278 --> 01:22:25.668
Because it feels a little strange
to be making out when, like--

01:22:25.668 --> 01:22:29.248
ASHLEY: I know.
LAURA: I'm going to peek out of the dome.

01:22:29.248 --> 01:22:30.698
Is Lucien still just staring at--

01:22:30.698 --> 01:22:32.308
MATT: Still awake, just staring over at the dome.

01:22:32.308 --> 01:22:33.568
LAURA: Yeah, it feels creepy to do it

01:22:33.568 --> 01:22:35.038
when that's happening right there.

01:22:35.038 --> 01:22:35.871
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:22:39.358 --> 01:22:40.408
He's given us a salute.

01:22:40.408 --> 01:22:43.128
LAURA: I wonder if he can hear us. Can you hear us, Lucien?

01:22:43.128 --> 01:22:45.073
ASHLEY: Lucien.
LAURA: Can you hear us?

01:22:45.073 --> 01:22:47.020
ASHLEY: Hey, can you hear me?

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.203
Can you hear me?
LAURA: Can you hear me?

01:22:50.203 --> 01:22:52.786
(laughter)
ASHLEY: He's pretending.

01:22:55.178 --> 01:22:56.691
Well, I'm excited for you.

01:22:57.858 --> 01:23:00.448
No pressure, whatever happens.

01:23:00.448 --> 01:23:04.081
But how beautiful to explore those things!

01:23:05.748 --> 01:23:06.581
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:08.398 --> 01:23:09.901
I look over at Beau sleeping.

01:23:11.428 --> 01:23:13.978
ASHLEY: I cover her up because she's like starfished,

01:23:13.978 --> 01:23:18.468
pull up her blanket, tuck in her arms.

01:23:18.468 --> 01:23:21.829
MARISHA: One arm's, like, half on Caduceus,

01:23:21.829 --> 01:23:24.111
like a leg over Caleb.

01:23:25.188 --> 01:23:27.788
LAURA: It's pretty tight in here, you know?

01:23:27.788 --> 01:23:31.748
ASHLEY: Pretty tight, I think I'm ready to sleep in the...

01:23:31.748 --> 01:23:32.728
I can sleep anywhere,

01:23:32.728 --> 01:23:34.388
but, man, after sleeping in that tower

01:23:34.388 --> 01:23:37.301
and having your own place with a fireplace and...

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:39.453
It's nice.

01:23:44.658 --> 01:23:48.283
Well, I hope we make it through.

01:23:49.414 --> 01:23:51.618
LAURA: (whispering) I hope we destroy the city.

01:23:51.618 --> 01:23:53.358
ASHLEY: (whispering) I do, too.

01:23:53.358 --> 01:23:55.988
I want it gone. It's not good, and

01:23:57.989 --> 01:24:01.358
I hope we can have a part in taking it down,

01:24:01.358 --> 01:24:02.584
whatever that means.

01:24:02.584 --> 01:24:03.417
LAURA: Me too.

01:24:04.558 --> 01:24:05.391
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:08.876
MATT: Okay.

01:24:12.036 --> 01:24:14.428
LAURA and ASHLEY: Okay.

01:24:14.428 --> 01:24:15.288
MATT: You finish your watch.

01:24:15.288 --> 01:24:17.038
Who's taking the last watch?

01:24:17.038 --> 01:24:18.638
MARISHA: I'll go.
LIAM: This wasn't bullshit.

01:24:18.638 --> 01:24:21.348
MATT: Okay. Beau and-- just Beau?

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:22.858
All righty.
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll do it.

01:24:22.858 --> 01:24:25.058
MATT: Okay, the two of you guys take final watch.

01:24:27.756 --> 01:24:29.408
MARISHA: 'Sup.

01:24:29.408 --> 01:24:30.910
TRAVIS: Smells like farts in here.

01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:35.038
(laughter)

01:24:35.038 --> 01:24:38.631
MARISHA: Deeply. Boba farts.

01:24:39.918 --> 01:24:42.043
TRAVIS: Only one, one per day.

01:24:44.812 --> 01:24:46.745
Is Lucien still awake?

01:24:47.878 --> 01:24:50.062
MARISHA: I poke my head out. Is he still awake?

01:24:50.062 --> 01:24:53.168
MATT: Yeah, he's still just sitting back there watching.

01:24:53.168 --> 01:24:54.088
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:24:54.088 --> 01:24:55.138
MATT: It's really creepy.

01:24:56.018 --> 01:24:58.048
MARISHA: Does he blink?

01:24:58.048 --> 01:25:00.156
I poke my head up again. Does he blink?

01:25:00.156 --> 01:25:01.198
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: After watching for, like--

01:25:01.198 --> 01:25:02.264
MATT: With disadvantage.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:03.231
MARISHA: With disadvantage?

01:25:04.827 --> 01:25:09.082
Oh, that's really good. I rolled 15 and 19. 19 total.

01:25:09.082 --> 01:25:12.003
MATT: 19 total? You're not seeing him blink, no.

01:25:13.258 --> 01:25:16.268
MARISHA: It's below freezing outside.

01:25:16.268 --> 01:25:19.669
How is eyeballs not freezing out of his sockets?

01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:21.502
TRAVIS: They might be. They might be frozen open.

01:25:21.502 --> 01:25:23.786
Perhaps this is our chance.

01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:26.371
MARISHA: I don't think it is--
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:28.462
MARISHA: -- but (chuckles).

01:25:30.043 --> 01:25:32.084
TRAVIS: You and me. You take one eye, I'll take the other.

01:25:32.084 --> 01:25:33.384
MARISHA: Okay!

01:25:33.384 --> 01:25:35.798
TRAVIS: Great, great plan.

01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:38.238
MARISHA: I've got a few ninja stars left.

01:25:38.238 --> 01:25:39.138
TRAVIS: All we need is two.

01:25:39.138 --> 01:25:41.118
MARISHA: How wild is your aim?

01:25:41.118 --> 01:25:42.505
MATT: Bob bob.
MARISHA: This could be it.

01:25:42.505 --> 01:25:43.338
Bob bob.

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:45.828
Yeah, the reflection in the moonlight

01:25:45.828 --> 01:25:47.039
and all you see is Bob.

01:25:47.039 --> 01:25:50.278
(laughter)

01:25:50.278 --> 01:25:53.125
TRAVIS: Hey, I meant to tell you, I--

01:25:53.125 --> 01:25:57.424
I told Jester how I--

01:25:57.424 --> 01:25:59.140
how I...

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.520
MARISHA: You did? Sorry, Caduceus.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.001
TALIESIN: (snores)

01:26:03.001 --> 01:26:06.102
MARISHA: You did?
TRAVIS: Yeah, on the-- real, yeah.

01:26:06.102 --> 01:26:07.558
MARISHA: How'd it go?

01:26:07.558 --> 01:26:09.263
TRAVIS: It went okay.

01:26:09.263 --> 01:26:11.089
I was pretty nervous.

01:26:11.089 --> 01:26:13.838
MARISHA: Yeah? What do you mean okay, though?

01:26:13.838 --> 01:26:14.746
What's okay?

01:26:14.746 --> 01:26:16.837
TRAVIS: No, it was good. I-- uh.

01:26:18.762 --> 01:26:19.595
We kissed.

01:26:19.595 --> 01:26:22.929
MARISHA: (gasping) Sorry, Caduceus. Sorry.

01:26:22.929 --> 01:26:25.048
TALIESIN: (groans)

01:26:25.048 --> 01:26:29.313
MARISHA: That's so exciting. Was she, like, leaning in?

01:26:29.313 --> 01:26:33.348
Was she into it or was she like, "Okay."

01:26:33.348 --> 01:26:37.935
TRAVIS: I don't know. You know, it wasn't...

01:26:39.638 --> 01:26:41.996
She seemed happy.

01:26:44.004 --> 01:26:47.262
All I could hear was my (blood pulsing).
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:26:47.262 --> 01:26:49.788
TRAVIS: It was really tough.
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.278
That's pretty magical.

01:26:51.278 --> 01:26:52.111
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:26:53.078 --> 01:26:57.168
MARISHA: I mean, I noticed, like, there was a breakfast

01:26:57.168 --> 01:27:01.410
and you guys were not making eye contact in a weird way.

01:27:01.410 --> 01:27:03.775
TRAVIS: Oh. Oh, it might be weird now?

01:27:03.775 --> 01:27:06.668
MARISHA: No, no, I think it
was just, like, after that moment

01:27:06.668 --> 01:27:09.738
and you're, like, you don't want to give anything away,

01:27:09.738 --> 01:27:11.188
so you try to avoid each other,

01:27:11.188 --> 01:27:15.368
but also you're really infatuated, so it's not working.

01:27:15.368 --> 01:27:16.201
TRAVIS: Shit!

01:27:17.038 --> 01:27:18.198
MARISHA: But you did great.

01:27:18.198 --> 01:27:19.998
TRAVIS: I got to dial it in.

01:27:19.998 --> 01:27:22.454
MARISHA: It's good, what? Like, why?

01:27:22.454 --> 01:27:24.738
TRAVIS: Well, I don't-- it just--

01:27:24.738 --> 01:27:27.298
It doesn't seem like we ever get a reprieve from anything,

01:27:27.298 --> 01:27:32.298
so after the statues sucked her life, I was--

01:27:33.727 --> 01:27:35.194
Who knows how long we have.

01:27:37.348 --> 01:27:39.448
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Sorry, that sounded super dark.

01:27:39.448 --> 01:27:43.598
MARISHA: No, on that note, I kind of--

01:27:43.598 --> 01:27:44.439
We were in, like--

01:27:44.439 --> 01:27:47.009
We just walked through a creepy forest

01:27:47.009 --> 01:27:49.038
and we were, like, a mile beneath the earth

01:27:49.038 --> 01:27:51.045
and I kind of asked Yasha on a date.

01:27:51.045 --> 01:27:52.251
TRAVIS: You did what?!

01:27:52.251 --> 01:27:54.069
MARISHA: I know.

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:55.277
TRAVIS: You asked her out on a date?

01:27:55.277 --> 01:27:56.535
SAM: (displeased noises)

01:27:56.535 --> 01:27:59.597
(laughter)

01:27:59.597 --> 01:28:01.508
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:28:01.508 --> 01:28:02.670
TRAVIS: What'd she say?

01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:04.966
MARISHA: She said yes. She said yes. That she was--

01:28:04.966 --> 01:28:06.838
TRAVIS: Shit!
MARISHA: She was, like, really excited.

01:28:06.838 --> 01:28:09.145
She was like, "I'm happy about this because, like--"

01:28:11.448 --> 01:28:13.195
I don't know whether it's--

01:28:14.528 --> 01:28:16.598
I just want a fresh start with Yasha

01:28:16.598 --> 01:28:18.491
because we've been through so much.

01:28:19.348 --> 01:28:22.001
I was thinking about it the other day.

01:28:23.188 --> 01:28:27.908
I've fought Yasha, like, four times in hand-to-hand combat.

01:28:27.908 --> 01:28:30.177
TRAVIS: Yeah, you really did.

01:28:30.177 --> 01:28:32.508
MARISHA: We've had more physical contact

01:28:32.508 --> 01:28:35.928
through beating the shit out of each other

01:28:35.928 --> 01:28:37.908
than anything else.

01:28:37.908 --> 01:28:41.249
So it feels like there's a little bit of this past baggage.

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:43.224
So it feels like there's a little bit of this past baggage.

01:28:43.224 --> 01:28:44.207
TRAVIS: Muscle memory, yeah.

01:28:44.207 --> 01:28:45.873
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: I'm with you, yeah.

01:28:45.873 --> 01:28:47.831
MARISHA: So it just felt like maybe,

01:28:50.538 --> 01:28:52.838
maybe a date.

01:28:52.838 --> 01:28:56.038
But, full disclosure, the last time I went on a date--

01:28:56.038 --> 01:29:00.518
Growing up, my idea of a date was to get tipsy

01:29:00.518 --> 01:29:04.638
and then commit a B&amp;E and then get more tipsy

01:29:04.638 --> 01:29:06.588
and then maybe end the night with blackmail,

01:29:06.588 --> 01:29:08.288
depending on how the B&amp;E went.

01:29:08.288 --> 01:29:13.050
TRAVIS: Wow, your romantic life is really unique.

01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:14.788
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:14.788 --> 01:29:18.328
TRAVIS: You're going to go on a date, like, now?

01:29:18.328 --> 01:29:21.781
MARISHA: Well, same thing, we could die tomorrow.

01:29:21.781 --> 01:29:24.208
We could die at any point and I think--

01:29:24.208 --> 01:29:26.108
TRAVIS: Why don't you just go have a picnic

01:29:26.108 --> 01:29:27.358
by the lava or something?

01:29:28.218 --> 01:29:32.731
MARISHA: Well. Peek my head out to Lucien.

01:29:36.268 --> 01:29:38.034
That's not--

01:29:38.034 --> 01:29:39.722
TRAVIS: Right.
MARISHA: That's creepy.

01:29:39.722 --> 01:29:40.647
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:29:40.647 --> 01:29:41.598
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:41.598 --> 01:29:43.548
TRAVIS: I look at Lucien. Is he blinking yet?

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:47.022
(whisper-yell) Lucien!

01:29:48.254 --> 01:29:49.190
(whisper-yell) Lucien!

01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:50.481
LIAM: Ugh, <i>meine Auge</i>.

01:29:52.443 --> 01:29:53.793
MATT: He sits up a bit.

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:58.308
TRAVIS: (whispering) You good?

01:30:01.647 --> 01:30:04.231
It's weird.
MARISHA: I know. I know.

01:30:05.878 --> 01:30:07.681
Anyway, I figure I could just,

01:30:09.498 --> 01:30:12.303
I don't know, next time we're in the tower--

01:30:12.303 --> 01:30:13.911
TRAVIS: Yes!
MARISHA: -- make some adjustments.

01:30:13.911 --> 01:30:15.577
TRAVIS: Sure.
MARISHA: Have a little quiet night,

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:16.485
have some dinner,

01:30:16.485 --> 01:30:17.525
eat some bugs.

01:30:17.525 --> 01:30:19.598
TRAVIS: Yeah, you just got to find a quiet spot.

01:30:19.598 --> 01:30:21.508
Like, what's above our rooms?

01:30:21.508 --> 01:30:22.878
Just go to the very top.

01:30:22.878 --> 01:30:26.528
I'm sure there's a moonlit, starry night

01:30:26.528 --> 01:30:27.951
you could take advantage of. Yeah!

01:30:27.951 --> 01:30:30.151
MARISHA: I wonder if

01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:34.328
Caleb would lend out his penthouse,

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:36.718
his upper floor because we've never seen it.

01:30:36.718 --> 01:30:37.934
TRAVIS: Of course!

01:30:37.934 --> 01:30:39.088
Just sneak up.

01:30:39.088 --> 01:30:42.198
It'll be super romantic and it'll be like a B&amp;E

01:30:42.198 --> 01:30:44.298
without getting fucked up and everything!

01:30:44.298 --> 01:30:46.397
MARISHA: God, this is the best idea.
TRAVIS: Go with what you know.

01:30:46.397 --> 01:30:47.530
Go with what you know.

01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:51.158
MARISHA: Okay, okay,
I kind of like this. I kind of like this.

01:30:51.158 --> 01:30:52.958
All right.

01:30:52.958 --> 01:30:55.388
TRAVIS: All right.
MARISHA: You have the best ideas.

01:30:55.388 --> 01:30:56.998
TRAVIS: Hey, good job.

01:30:56.998 --> 01:30:58.223
MARISHA: Thanks, Cap'n.

01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:00.563
We've got this.

01:31:01.414 --> 01:31:02.838
All right.
TRAVIS: Keep watch.

01:31:02.838 --> 01:31:04.555
MATT: All right.

01:31:04.555 --> 01:31:06.925
You guys finish your watch.

01:31:06.925 --> 01:31:10.838
And the sun isn't yet rising

01:31:10.838 --> 01:31:12.028
when you finish your eight-hour rest,

01:31:12.028 --> 01:31:13.301
since you went to bed relatively early,

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:14.725
waiting for the next morning to come.

01:31:14.725 --> 01:31:16.208
TRAVIS: We're some old people.

01:31:16.208 --> 01:31:17.863
MATT: Yep.
(laughter)

01:31:17.863 --> 01:31:19.138
TRAVIS: Oh god!

01:31:19.138 --> 01:31:22.398
ASHLEY: It's 7:30, it's time for bed.

01:31:22.398 --> 01:31:23.548
MATT: What is still surreal, though,

01:31:23.548 --> 01:31:26.948
is in all the nights that you've spent out here

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:31.328
in this frozen wasteland that is Eiselcross,

01:31:31.328 --> 01:31:36.098
there is something odd and beautiful and ominous

01:31:36.098 --> 01:31:38.768
about that bright orange glow

01:31:38.768 --> 01:31:43.768
that peeks out of the darkness all through the night.

01:31:43.768 --> 01:31:47.498
As you all wake up and begin to get your things

01:31:47.498 --> 01:31:50.681
and mentally prepare yourself for whatever is ahead,

01:31:51.548 --> 01:31:54.268
you can just see that just the darkness of the snow

01:31:54.268 --> 01:31:57.238
beyond the source of your light and fire

01:31:58.568 --> 01:31:59.981
and just pitch black,

01:32:00.938 --> 01:32:05.528
and then the burning orange glowing embers of this river

01:32:05.528 --> 01:32:07.761
stretching from right to left.

01:32:09.497 --> 01:32:12.158
You begin to hear the Tomb Takers rousing,

01:32:12.158 --> 01:32:14.438
getting up and talking amongst themselves.

01:32:14.438 --> 01:32:17.608
A little bit of food is being cooked

01:32:17.608 --> 01:32:19.838
and distributed amongst their group.

01:32:19.838 --> 01:32:21.838
You guys get yourselves roused, fed

01:32:21.838 --> 01:32:24.428
and ready just as the sky begins

01:32:24.428 --> 01:32:28.351
to slowly turn to a lighter color.

01:32:29.268 --> 01:32:34.268
It's still a fairly clear day and you hear Lucien go,

01:32:35.155 --> 01:32:39.728
"Well, fuck! Cree, you have that?"

01:32:39.728 --> 01:32:41.465
And Cree goes, "Of course."

01:32:42.528 --> 01:32:45.218
And she goes, "Gets the others around,"

01:32:45.218 --> 01:32:48.308
and Otis comes by and starts patting you on the shoulder.

01:32:48.308 --> 01:32:51.830
And like, "You're all ready?"
MARISHA: (disturbed sound)

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:53.742
MATT: "Finish your meals, finish your meals."

01:32:55.368 --> 01:32:58.118
You see Cree step up to the edge and pull out

01:32:58.118 --> 01:32:59.548
and roll out this scroll

01:32:59.548 --> 01:33:04.258
this long piece of leather-like parchment, thick,

01:33:04.258 --> 01:33:05.751
begins to quietly read.

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:11.521
Looking up and then about a minute later of reading this,

01:33:12.538 --> 01:33:17.068
shouts one phrase out and the scroll just vanishes.

01:33:17.068 --> 01:33:20.668
Not in fire, but just a glowing cinder.

01:33:20.668 --> 01:33:23.438
Like you watched heat

01:33:23.438 --> 01:33:27.621
coil back a fine silk gossamer material, and then it's gone.

01:33:30.238 --> 01:33:33.522
Then nothing and Cree looks back to Lucien and nods.

01:33:33.522 --> 01:33:35.858
(claps hands)

01:33:35.858 --> 01:33:38.018
(as Lucien) "All right, get your warm things together,

01:33:38.018 --> 01:33:43.018
"gather your things about, what do you say?"

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:45.859
Actually, let me roll [inaudible] for this.

01:33:46.727 --> 01:33:48.118
Oh!

01:33:48.118 --> 01:33:49.519
"About 10 minutes."

01:33:51.048 --> 01:33:53.209
SAM: Had to roll to see how many minutes it would be?

01:33:53.209 --> 01:33:55.165
What did you roll d10, d12?

01:33:55.165 --> 01:33:56.430
MATT: d4.

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.788
TRAVIS: Can I also say: During our watch,

01:33:58.788 --> 01:34:03.738
I attuned to the smartly-purchased ring of fire resistance.

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:06.196
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: Because lava!

01:34:07.158 --> 01:34:08.738
MATT: Hey, look at that, man.

01:34:08.738 --> 01:34:09.929
TRAVIS: We're here.

01:34:09.929 --> 01:34:11.446
(laughter)

01:34:11.446 --> 01:34:12.512
5000 gold!

01:34:12.512 --> 01:34:14.748
LIAM: Long game. Long game.
MATT: Yeah.

01:34:15.823 --> 01:34:17.780
LAURA: Can I talk to Cree?

01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:20.858
MATT: Cree is just looking up at the sky.

01:34:20.858 --> 01:34:22.850
LAURA: What are we looking at?

01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:25.762
MATT: Right at that point, you look up and you can see

01:34:25.762 --> 01:34:30.041
clouds beginning to gather and darken.

01:34:30.041 --> 01:34:32.798
LAURA: You needed a storm, huh?

01:34:32.798 --> 01:34:37.158
MATT: "Indeed. So I made one."

01:34:37.158 --> 01:34:38.708
LAURA: That's impressive.

01:34:38.708 --> 01:34:41.178
Can you do it again or was that the scroll?

01:34:41.178 --> 01:34:42.275
MATT: "It was just the one time."

01:34:42.275 --> 01:34:43.908
LAURA: Oh, bummer.

01:34:45.058 --> 01:34:47.018
MATT: And over time, over the next 10 minutes--

01:34:47.018 --> 01:34:47.851
LIAM: Nifty.

01:34:47.851 --> 01:34:49.598
MATT: The light snowfall begins to drift

01:34:49.598 --> 01:34:52.651
from the now dark, covered, gray sky above.

01:34:54.228 --> 01:34:56.848
And as the snow falls onto the flames below

01:34:57.968 --> 01:35:00.098
just like the snow you had tossed,

01:35:00.098 --> 01:35:04.528
it begins to gather until you begin to see patches of snow

01:35:04.528 --> 01:35:06.528
that block the glow from beneath

01:35:06.528 --> 01:35:09.469
giving almost leaping stones.

01:35:10.466 --> 01:35:11.299
TRAVIS: Oh boy!

01:35:11.299 --> 01:35:13.286
MATT: And as more time passes,

01:35:14.598 --> 01:35:19.138
seems to be coating the river, somewhat.

01:35:20.818 --> 01:35:22.618
You see the heavy pouches set up now

01:35:22.618 --> 01:35:25.048
with Zoran carrying the large pouch.

01:35:25.048 --> 01:35:26.428
Otis carrying his objects,

01:35:26.428 --> 01:35:30.418
clicking around inside his-- Hers, I would say,

01:35:30.418 --> 01:35:32.238
over the shoulder.

01:35:32.238 --> 01:35:36.981
And you watch as they all prepare themselves and go,

01:35:38.625 --> 01:35:43.191
(as Lucien) "All right, I think it's time we travel.

01:35:46.078 --> 01:35:47.723
"But let's do it quietly.

01:35:49.198 --> 01:35:53.318
"You see, best we step gingerly,

01:35:53.318 --> 01:35:56.409
"fiery spirits sometimes wade in this burning stream."

01:35:56.409 --> 01:35:58.178
ASHLEY: Cool.
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:35:58.178 --> 01:36:00.128
MATT: "So hope you brought your quiet shoes."

01:36:01.248 --> 01:36:02.258
SAM: Sure.

01:36:02.258 --> 01:36:03.358
TALIESIN: You have quiet shoes?

01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:04.971
LAURA: I have Pass Without a Trace.

01:36:04.971 --> 01:36:06.088
SAM: Hey, that's good.
TALIESIN: That's a quiet shoe.

01:36:06.088 --> 01:36:06.921
SAM: That's good.

01:36:07.848 --> 01:36:10.168
TRAVIS: So if we're going to be moving now,

01:36:10.168 --> 01:36:15.168
anyone that would want to join us, should move quickly.

01:36:15.488 --> 01:36:17.676
SAM: Yeah, I mean, we're all going together, Fjord.

01:36:17.676 --> 01:36:19.743
TRAVIS: Yep, anyone that would want to follow--

01:36:19.743 --> 01:36:22.061
LAURA: It's us, Fjord, don't worry, we want to go.

01:36:24.318 --> 01:36:27.712
MATT: "All right. Let's search
for a way down the embankment."

01:36:27.712 --> 01:36:29.898
And with that, you all begin scouting

01:36:29.898 --> 01:36:32.778
along the edge of the cliff face

01:36:32.778 --> 01:36:35.551
that leads down into this river of lava.

01:36:36.428 --> 01:36:37.928
It doesn't take more than 20 minutes or so

01:36:37.928 --> 01:36:40.878
before you find a bit of a jagged path

01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:43.588
that eventually leads to the surface.

01:36:43.588 --> 01:36:45.358
And at this point now,

01:36:45.358 --> 01:36:46.238
the snow has been gathering

01:36:46.238 --> 01:36:47.928
where you can occasionally see bits

01:36:47.928 --> 01:36:50.388
of the orange glow breaking through,

01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:53.431
but now it's just this slow moving powder.

01:36:55.728 --> 01:36:56.561
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:59.108
MATT: As you begin to step down

01:36:59.108 --> 01:37:03.666
in a single file path

01:37:03.666 --> 01:37:05.932
formation to the bottom,

01:37:05.932 --> 01:37:09.750
Lucien goes and takes out a little

01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:12.655
smooth stone, not quite sure what it is

01:37:12.655 --> 01:37:15.668
and he takes it and throws it out

01:37:15.668 --> 01:37:20.328
and it hits the snow and the snow just puffs a little bit,

01:37:20.328 --> 01:37:21.538
sticks his foot out,

01:37:21.538 --> 01:37:26.334
and it crunches in the snow. Feels a bit.

01:37:26.334 --> 01:37:29.092
Looks back at you all with a smile.

01:37:29.092 --> 01:37:32.650
"Ha!" Does a leap. (crunching)

01:37:34.538 --> 01:37:38.508
"Right. Right."

01:37:38.508 --> 01:37:40.233
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:37:40.233 --> 01:37:41.066
MARISHA: This guy.

01:37:41.066 --> 01:37:43.417
MATT: "Follow. (shushes)."

01:37:43.417 --> 01:37:44.417
As he begins to step out,

01:37:44.417 --> 01:37:48.492
one by one, the Tomb Takers begin to make their way

01:37:48.492 --> 01:37:50.168
into the center of the lava river,

01:37:50.168 --> 01:37:51.768
waiting for you all to catch up.

01:37:53.508 --> 01:37:55.640
SAM: Let's go. Shall we?

01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:00.163
LAURA: I will cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

01:38:00.163 --> 01:38:04.373
MATT: Okay, how many people can you affect with that?

01:38:04.373 --> 01:38:05.208
LAURA: Let me look.

01:38:05.208 --> 01:38:08.058
TRAVIS: Should I do Underwater Breathing? Do we feel--

01:38:08.058 --> 01:38:09.085
SAM: Before we go out there--

01:38:09.085 --> 01:38:11.378
LAURA: Each creature within 30 feet of me.

01:38:11.378 --> 01:38:14.428
MATT: Okay. So you're getting you guys and the Tomb Takers?

01:38:14.428 --> 01:38:15.738
LAURA: No, just us.

01:38:15.738 --> 01:38:17.469
MATT: Okay. You got it.

01:38:17.469 --> 01:38:18.318
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

01:38:18.318 --> 01:38:19.658
SAM: Before we go out there,

01:38:19.658 --> 01:38:24.386
should we leave a note for our wheeled friend or anything?

01:38:24.386 --> 01:38:25.458
Anything that we need to tell him,

01:38:25.458 --> 01:38:27.181
I guess we can always message him.

01:38:28.548 --> 01:38:30.391
ASHLEY: I think he's also probably

01:38:30.391 --> 01:38:31.224
watching--
TALIESIN: We thinking about

01:38:31.224 --> 01:38:33.274
leaving something in the lava or no?

01:38:34.681 --> 01:38:36.264
LAURA and SAM: Oh!
SAM: Oh! Like a--

01:38:36.264 --> 01:38:38.739
TALIESIN: I'm casting Water Walk on myself

01:38:38.739 --> 01:38:41.808
and Protection from Energy.

01:38:41.808 --> 01:38:44.043
MATT: Okay. How long does Protection from Energy to last?

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:45.759
TALIESIN: An hour.
MATT: Okay.

01:38:47.528 --> 01:38:49.618
MARISHA: We were talking about dumping the--

01:38:49.618 --> 01:38:50.538
LAURA: Yeah, but it's--

01:38:50.538 --> 01:38:53.428
MARISHA: But it's not the same any more, yeah.

01:38:57.748 --> 01:38:58.581
LAURA: Can't do it.

01:38:58.581 --> 01:39:01.918
TRAVIS: I'll summon the Star Razor
as well, just to have it out.

01:39:01.918 --> 01:39:04.318
MATT: You got it, blade is there in your hand.

01:39:04.318 --> 01:39:07.401
Faint glow lighting you up.

01:39:07.401 --> 01:39:08.692
Just right off the edge way

01:39:08.692 --> 01:39:12.938
the five Tomb Takers are there,
looking and waiting expectantly.

01:39:12.938 --> 01:39:14.838
TRAVIS: Oh, was--
MARISHA: On the river or across it?

01:39:14.838 --> 01:39:15.671
MATT: No, they're on the river.

01:39:15.671 --> 01:39:17.721
It's a long way to cross, but you guys are moving together.

01:39:17.721 --> 01:39:18.738
TRAVIS: It's a mile across, right?

01:39:18.738 --> 01:39:19.571
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:39:19.571 --> 01:39:20.408
MATT: A little over a mile.

01:39:20.408 --> 01:39:22.118
MARISHA: All right, I follow them.

01:39:22.118 --> 01:39:23.478
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: Okay.

01:39:23.478 --> 01:39:24.311
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's go.

01:39:24.311 --> 01:39:26.308
MATT: So there'll be four lengths to this journey.

01:39:26.308 --> 01:39:27.141
For the first length,

01:39:27.141 --> 01:39:29.767
I need everyone to roll a communal stealth check.

01:39:29.767 --> 01:39:30.737
MARISHA: Whoa!

01:39:30.737 --> 01:39:33.883
LIAM: I'm going to use my transmuter's ability

01:39:33.883 --> 01:39:35.098
to not burn a spell slot.

01:39:35.098 --> 01:39:38.662
I'm going to turn into a
white ermine or white winter weasel.

01:39:38.662 --> 01:39:41.464
MATT: Okay. Okay.

01:39:41.464 --> 01:39:42.628
LAURA: Plus 10.

01:39:42.628 --> 01:39:43.808
MATT: If you'll be doing that,

01:39:43.808 --> 01:39:45.909
you'd be riding on one of your friends, then?

01:39:45.909 --> 01:39:47.078
LIAM: If I have to.

01:39:47.078 --> 01:39:49.718
I was thinking it would be small and light on the snow.

01:39:49.718 --> 01:39:50.888
MATT: That's true.

01:39:50.888 --> 01:39:52.554
You still can make a stealth check for your weasel form.

01:39:52.554 --> 01:39:53.648
Yes, you can do that.

01:39:53.648 --> 01:39:55.628
Okay, so?

01:39:55.628 --> 01:39:56.708
TRAVIS: 28.
MATT: 28.

01:39:56.708 --> 01:39:58.318
LAURA: 28.
MATT: Nice.

01:39:58.318 --> 01:39:59.722
LIAM: Ew.

01:39:59.722 --> 01:40:01.821
TRAVIS: We got the same score.

01:40:01.821 --> 01:40:04.598
LIAM: That was the weasel.
MATT: Natural one, got it. Okay.

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:05.431
SAM: 35.

01:40:07.028 --> 01:40:09.553
ASHLEY: 26.
MATT: Okay.

01:40:09.553 --> 01:40:10.918
TALIESIN: 21.
MATT: Okay.

01:40:10.918 --> 01:40:13.171
MARISHA: 34.
MATT: Okay.

01:40:13.171 --> 01:40:15.368
TRAVIS: Fucking weasels, man.

01:40:15.368 --> 01:40:16.836
LIAM: It wasn't at advantage, was it?

01:40:16.836 --> 01:40:19.568
It was just plus 10. Okay.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.888
MATT: Okay, some decent rolls all around.

01:40:27.138 --> 01:40:28.258
The first quarter of the journey,

01:40:28.258 --> 01:40:30.558
you all quietly gathered together, though

01:40:30.558 --> 01:40:34.285
still two slightly separate crews.

01:40:34.285 --> 01:40:37.001
(crunching footsteps)

01:40:37.001 --> 01:40:40.658
Stepping, the snow falling around you. Every now and then,

01:40:40.658 --> 01:40:44.976
some of the snow will separate as the embankments pull

01:40:44.976 --> 01:40:48.874
because the lava flow beneath
does not have a continuous flow,

01:40:48.874 --> 01:40:51.638
it shifts and changes as parts cool and break.

01:40:51.638 --> 01:40:54.888
And occasionally you'll just see an orange glow appear

01:40:54.888 --> 01:40:55.721
to the right of you

01:40:55.721 --> 01:40:58.921
and you have to carefully maneuver around.

01:41:00.558 --> 01:41:02.391
The anxiety builds.
SAM: Fjord, do you want to

01:41:02.391 --> 01:41:04.232
use your ring?

01:41:04.232 --> 01:41:05.502
TRAVIS: To do what?!

01:41:05.502 --> 01:41:06.577
SAM: Do you want me to, like, push you in

01:41:06.577 --> 01:41:07.598
or something?
TRAVIS: No.

01:41:07.598 --> 01:41:11.028
Why test the merchandise? It was clearly worth every--

01:41:11.028 --> 01:41:12.178
SAM: All right, all right.

01:41:13.298 --> 01:41:16.688
MATT: Now for the second length of this,

01:41:16.688 --> 01:41:17.628
as you begin to make your way

01:41:17.628 --> 01:41:19.821
towards the center of this river,

01:41:19.821 --> 01:41:21.168
I need everybody to make another stealth check, please.

01:41:21.168 --> 01:41:23.507
LIAM: And I assume that one is the weasel almost going in

01:41:23.507 --> 01:41:24.737
and going, "Eee!"

01:41:24.737 --> 01:41:26.194
TRAVIS: Does Pass Without a Trace keep up?

01:41:26.194 --> 01:41:27.169
TALIESIN: Hey!

01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:29.780
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:32.179
ASHLEY: No way, really?
LAURA: Balance.

01:41:32.179 --> 01:41:33.479
ASHLEY: Wow.
LIAM: So 30.

01:41:33.479 --> 01:41:35.978
TRAVIS: And it stays up, right? Pass Without a Trace?
MATT: Okay.

01:41:35.978 --> 01:41:37.958
Fjord.
TRAVIS: 27.

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.498
LAURA: 33.

01:41:39.498 --> 01:41:40.448
LIAM: 30.
MATT: Yep.

01:41:40.448 --> 01:41:41.468
SAM: 39.

01:41:41.468 --> 01:41:42.368
ASHLEY: 26, again.

01:41:42.368 --> 01:41:43.201
TALIESIN: 31.

01:41:43.201 --> 01:41:44.628
MARISHA: 31.

01:41:44.628 --> 01:41:45.988
MATT: Good round of rolls

01:41:45.988 --> 01:41:49.458
and covered quite well for the Tomb Takers,

01:41:49.458 --> 01:41:52.188
who did not have a good round that time.

01:41:52.188 --> 01:41:53.168
They took a few steps.

01:41:53.168 --> 01:41:56.538
At one point, you see some of the snow crumples inward,

01:41:56.538 --> 01:41:57.838
and there's just a bright orange glow.

01:41:57.838 --> 01:41:59.528
And you see Otis kind of, "Ah!"

01:41:59.528 --> 01:42:01.765
and Zoran grabs them by the scruff of the neck

01:42:01.765 --> 01:42:04.248
and pulls them back and sets down.

01:42:04.248 --> 01:42:07.835
LAURA: Which one is carrying the threshold crest?

01:42:07.835 --> 01:42:11.988
MATT: From you'd guess, Zoran,
who has the large pack on the back.

01:42:11.988 --> 01:42:14.148
The only pack that is large enough

01:42:14.148 --> 01:42:17.628
and appears to be full enough to be carrying it.

01:42:17.628 --> 01:42:19.839
LIAM: It's a backpack in the shape of diamond.

01:42:19.839 --> 01:42:21.508
TALIESIN: Be a shame if that backpack ended up in the lava.

01:42:21.508 --> 01:42:26.168
MATT: You guys now, continuing to the center of this

01:42:26.168 --> 01:42:27.678
and you've reached that mid-point

01:42:27.678 --> 01:42:29.248
where looking front and back,

01:42:29.248 --> 01:42:32.248
it is an equidistant journey.

01:42:32.248 --> 01:42:35.798
And you see elements of the river shifting a bit

01:42:35.798 --> 01:42:39.331
more pockets begin to open, light begins to pour through,

01:42:41.628 --> 01:42:43.978
but it seems to be working okay.

01:42:43.978 --> 01:42:45.618
If I could have everybody roll stealth checks again

01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:47.985
for the third length of this journey.

01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:54.043
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:42:56.658 --> 01:42:57.491
MATT: Okay.

01:43:01.468 --> 01:43:02.301
Okay.

01:43:03.338 --> 01:43:04.538
TRAVIS: ♪ 26. ♪

01:43:04.538 --> 01:43:05.628
MATT: Nice.

01:43:05.628 --> 01:43:07.394
LAURA: 24.
MATT: Okay.

01:43:07.394 --> 01:43:08.344
LIAM: 17.

01:43:09.768 --> 01:43:11.776
SAM: 41.
MATT: Okay.

01:43:12.928 --> 01:43:14.538
ASHLEY: 20, total.

01:43:14.538 --> 01:43:16.008
MATT: Right.

01:43:16.008 --> 01:43:16.841
LIAM: Yes!

01:43:16.841 --> 01:43:18.528
TALIESIN: 31.
MATT: 31.

01:43:18.528 --> 01:43:20.701
MARISHA: 30.
MATT: Nice. Okay.

01:43:25.638 --> 01:43:26.471
LAURA: Oh no!

01:43:28.528 --> 01:43:29.551
MATT: Unfortunately--

01:43:32.478 --> 01:43:34.202
SAM: You had to roll a 45.

01:43:34.202 --> 01:43:36.508
(laughter)

01:43:36.508 --> 01:43:39.418
MATT: It was it was a pretty decent group DC.

01:43:39.418 --> 01:43:41.838
Twice in a row, the Tomb Takers had a terrible round.

01:43:41.838 --> 01:43:43.068
There was a natural one in there

01:43:43.068 --> 01:43:45.781
that also skewed it heavily in a bad place.

01:43:47.818 --> 01:43:51.584
But as you all are carefully making your way across.

01:43:51.584 --> 01:43:52.575
TRAVIS and SAM: ♪ Makin' my way ♪

01:43:52.575 --> 01:43:57.500
MATT: One of the straps on Zoran's pack

01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:00.218
snaps and it swings a bit and Zoran loses his balance

01:44:00.218 --> 01:44:03.088
and instead hits the ground with a heavy hit.

01:44:03.088 --> 01:44:03.998
LIAM: Oh no!

01:44:03.998 --> 01:44:04.918
MATT: He gets back up quickly

01:44:04.918 --> 01:44:07.028
and as he pulls up, the snow pulls off on the outside

01:44:07.028 --> 01:44:09.568
and the powder beneath that was being stepped on

01:44:09.568 --> 01:44:12.638
is a little bit now glowing with the orange.

01:44:12.638 --> 01:44:13.648
And there's a quiet moment.

01:44:13.648 --> 01:44:17.274
And Lucien goes (shushing) and you all just tense up.

01:44:19.105 --> 01:44:21.355
SAM: Yeah, it's not us, Lucien.

01:44:24.808 --> 01:44:27.038
MATT: "Right, I think we're okay.

01:44:27.038 --> 01:44:28.171
"Let's keep going."

01:44:30.987 --> 01:44:32.478
Caduceus.

01:44:32.478 --> 01:44:34.011
TALIESIN: Shit.

01:44:34.011 --> 01:44:34.898
MATT: Beauregard.

01:44:34.898 --> 01:44:37.678
TRAVIS: It's never good when it's you two.

01:44:37.678 --> 01:44:40.643
MATT: Caleb.
MARISHA: What?! No!

01:44:40.643 --> 01:44:42.926
MATT: As you all were walking forward, you see--

01:44:42.926 --> 01:44:45.878
you've become familiar with some of these orange glows

01:44:45.878 --> 01:44:48.518
that begin to break through as the flow shifts

01:44:48.518 --> 01:44:50.018
and the snow gets pulled apart.

01:44:51.478 --> 01:44:55.788
You watch as one pack of snow,

01:44:55.788 --> 01:44:57.818
a lot of orange begins to emerge

01:44:57.818 --> 01:45:01.468
and you watch the snow begin to rapidly melt

01:45:01.468 --> 01:45:03.408
and steam begin to rise.

01:45:03.408 --> 01:45:07.368
As you see a figure begin to drift up atop

01:45:07.368 --> 01:45:09.868
made of roiling flame,

01:45:09.868 --> 01:45:13.348
that pops up like a gopher

01:45:13.348 --> 01:45:15.408
through its gopher hole to look.

01:45:15.408 --> 01:45:17.758
And as you see, there's no features.

01:45:17.758 --> 01:45:21.678
It's just an entity of fire rolling and shifting.

01:45:21.678 --> 01:45:23.818
But you swear you see eyes, you something glowing.

01:45:23.818 --> 01:45:27.723
And it appears back below.

01:45:27.723 --> 01:45:29.292
ASHLEY: Anne, Anne, Anne.

01:45:29.292 --> 01:45:33.368
TRAVIS: I grab Jester's arm and I pull her close to me

01:45:33.368 --> 01:45:37.121
and I'll use my Channel Divinity to Create Marine layer.

01:45:38.178 --> 01:45:39.011
MATT: Okay.

01:45:39.011 --> 01:45:41.688
TRAVIS: And a fog extends anybody within five feet

01:45:41.688 --> 01:45:44.171
of me is obscured.

01:45:45.988 --> 01:45:48.346
So I'll just start reaching out and pulling the team.

01:45:48.346 --> 01:45:50.858
MATT: Well, everyone within five feet of you can still see,

01:45:50.858 --> 01:45:52.501
it radiates out for 20 feet from you.

01:45:52.501 --> 01:45:54.208
TRAVIS: Right, yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Oh right.

01:45:54.208 --> 01:45:55.138
TALIESIN: Oh.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:45:55.138 --> 01:45:56.488
LAURA: So yeah, when he-- okay.

01:45:56.488 --> 01:45:58.068
MARISHA: Gather close to Fjord.

01:45:58.068 --> 01:45:59.159
TRAVIS: Yeah, just (shushes).

01:45:59.159 --> 01:46:01.558
Come here.
SAM: As we gather close, I would just say:

01:46:01.558 --> 01:46:03.998
Hey, if this shit is going down,

01:46:03.998 --> 01:46:05.638
should we use it as an opportunity

01:46:05.638 --> 01:46:08.088
to take the other threshold crest and run?

01:46:08.088 --> 01:46:09.444
I'm just throwing it out there.

01:46:09.444 --> 01:46:11.683
MARISHA: It's honestly not a bad idea.
Do you think it's on his back?

01:46:11.683 --> 01:46:13.370
Do you think it's on Zoran's bag?
TRAVIS: They can probably hear us.

01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:18.188
SAM: No, I'm saying this low, quietly.

01:46:18.188 --> 01:46:20.145
LIAM: The weasel stands up on two little hind legs

01:46:20.145 --> 01:46:23.305
and then just goes and grows up.

01:46:23.305 --> 01:46:24.997
SAM: I'm whispering it.

01:46:24.997 --> 01:46:27.568
ASHLEY: Yasha, as you guys are having this conversation,

01:46:27.568 --> 01:46:30.148
you can't really see much because of the fog around you,

01:46:30.148 --> 01:46:31.748
except for the people immediately around you.

01:46:31.748 --> 01:46:33.298
And as you take a step forward,

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:37.775
your foot gets extremely warm and you glance down

01:46:37.775 --> 01:46:40.818
and the snow where you're stepping is melted away

01:46:40.818 --> 01:46:42.428
and you can see the orange glow behind

01:46:42.428 --> 01:46:44.878
and you just pull your foot back.

01:46:44.878 --> 01:46:45.948
And as you look back into space,

01:46:45.948 --> 01:46:49.678
you see this flaming face

01:46:49.678 --> 01:46:50.738
begin to peer up through.

01:46:50.738 --> 01:46:53.071
MARISHA: I personally think we should run.

01:46:54.738 --> 01:46:55.806
MATT: And that's where we're going to take a break.

01:46:55.806 --> 01:46:58.425
(screaming)
TRAVIS: You stepped on its face!

01:46:58.425 --> 01:46:59.851
MARISHA: Goddamn it!

01:46:59.851 --> 01:47:01.634
ASHLEY: Oh! Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

01:47:02.968 --> 01:47:06.088
MARISHA: How far into this river are we?

01:47:06.088 --> 01:47:07.882
We had just gotten to half.

01:47:07.882 --> 01:47:10.872
MATT: You're about, maybe, two-thirds of the way across.

01:47:10.872 --> 01:47:12.758
TRAVIS: Not a good spot to get in a fight.

01:47:12.758 --> 01:47:16.168
LAURA: Oh no, I think the fog could actually be a danger.

01:47:16.168 --> 01:47:18.164
SAM: It's always worked before.

01:47:18.164 --> 01:47:20.258
(laughter)

01:47:20.258 --> 01:47:22.468
It's going to be fine.

01:47:22.468 --> 01:47:24.248
TALIESIN: I have opinions, but I'll wait.

01:47:24.248 --> 01:47:25.418
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:47:25.418 --> 01:47:26.548
TRAVIS: I could drop it. I could drop it.

01:47:26.548 --> 01:47:28.878
MATT: But we'll figure it out, regardless.

01:47:28.878 --> 01:47:30.828
ASHLEY: Use the fog to dump in the...

01:47:32.758 --> 01:47:36.308
MARISHA: Oh, oh!
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. Oh.

01:47:36.308 --> 01:47:37.348
MARISHA: We have options.

01:47:37.348 --> 01:47:38.348
We have options.
TALIESIN: We have options.

01:47:38.348 --> 01:47:41.648
SAM: Except we all have to protect Yasha's life.

01:47:41.648 --> 01:47:43.218
LAURA: Yes, that, too.
ASHLEY: I'll be fine.

01:47:43.218 --> 01:47:46.433
MATT: Okay, well, we'll come back to this in just a moment

01:47:46.433 --> 01:47:48.507
and see what transpires.
SAM: 2021!

01:47:48.507 --> 01:47:50.056
MATT: We'll see you guys here in a few minutes.

01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:52.542
Wow.
Wow.

01:47:52.542 --> 01:47:53.650
You dive in.

01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:55.190
Mad respect.

01:47:55.190 --> 01:47:56.880
Max messaged the rest of us

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.669
and he was like, "She went full Taliesin."

01:47:59.669 --> 01:48:00.547
(all laughing)

01:48:00.547 --> 01:48:01.820
"She went hard mode."
Yeah.

01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.480
That's such a compliment.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.120
I came with my A game.

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:08.760
It was early morning, I had a cup of coffee.

01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:12.910
I was awake, I had my CEO brain clicking

01:48:12.910 --> 01:48:15.459
and then I just got kicked in the (bleep) teeth.

01:48:15.459 --> 01:48:16.292
(laughing)

01:48:16.292 --> 01:48:18.875
(upbeat music)

01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:34.790
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:37.213
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:41.020
Ooh, look at this.

01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:43.313
Look at the details, oooh.

01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:48.393
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:52.210
I mean, the Traveler always says

01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:54.523
impulse purchases are a good decision.

01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:59.283
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:02.980
Hey, look at these.

01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:04.363
They go on your face.

01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:09.043
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:12.010
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:13.093
You've still got time.

01:49:15.792 --> 01:49:18.209
(rock music)

01:49:21.571 --> 01:49:23.232
(cheering)

01:49:23.232 --> 01:49:24.910
Yeah! We did it!

01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:25.743
Yeah!

01:49:25.743 --> 01:49:27.510
Sam Riegel, you just won the Super Bowl.

01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:28.640
What are you gonna do now?

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.940
I'm subscribing to Critical Role, yeah!

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:32.793
Wonderful, and that-

01:49:32.793 --> 01:49:35.010
It's about perseverance, like remembering

01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:38.860
to resubscribe with Twitch Prime every month, yeah!

01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:39.880
Well, could you-

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.220
Have done it without my teammates?

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:42.690
Come on, no way!

01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:44.120
And they couldn't have done it without

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:46.540
the Twitch subscriptions that I gave them.

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:47.836
Right, guys? Yeah!

01:49:47.836 --> 01:49:49.379
Okay Sam, but what about-

01:49:49.379 --> 01:49:52.620
What about what inspires me, you mean?

01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:54.680
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:58.020
I mean, watching that dehydrated piece of string cheese,

01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:00.200
Brian Foster every couple of weeks

01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.870
really gets me pumped for the big game!

01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:04.779
Sam, hold on. We have to-

01:50:04.779 --> 01:50:06.210
You can't believe it?

01:50:06.210 --> 01:50:07.070
You can't believe it,

01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.903
is that what you said?

01:50:07.903 --> 01:50:10.470
Well, it's true, because every Yee-Haw VOD

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:13.510
is instantly available as soon as you subscribe.

01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:14.556
It's amazing!
Sam!

01:50:14.556 --> 01:50:15.960
You did it, guys!
Sam!

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.690
Yeah! Yeah!
Sam!

01:50:17.690 --> 01:50:18.720
Yeah! What, sorry.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:21.030
Just say "I'm going to Disneyland."

01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:23.110
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:23.943
Oh.

01:50:24.885 --> 01:50:25.718
Uh...

01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:29.187
What's a Disneyland?

01:50:29.187 --> 01:50:31.374
(dramatic music)

01:50:31.374 --> 01:50:34.207
(whistle blowing)

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:37.695
I don't know, I gotta be honest with you.

01:50:37.695 --> 01:50:38.560
Oooh...

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:41.240
I got hit in the head pretty hard out there.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:42.190
Oh my God.

01:50:43.846 --> 01:50:45.813
I'm not good at sports,

01:50:45.813 --> 01:50:47.661
(crowd groaning)

01:50:47.661 --> 01:50:48.561
(whooshing)

01:50:48.561 --> 01:50:51.311
(crowd cheering)

02:07:39.766 --> 02:07:41.166
MATT: Welcome back.

02:07:41.166 --> 02:07:45.721
All right, so, last we left off: The Mighty Nein--

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.993
SAM: Oh yeah.
MATT: -- were having an issue

02:07:48.993 --> 02:07:52.446
on the snow-covered lava river.
TALIESIN: Shit.

02:07:52.446 --> 02:07:56.786
MATT: As you had just come across the midway point,

02:07:56.786 --> 02:07:59.546
close to about the two-thirds section,

02:07:59.546 --> 02:08:03.789
realizing, with Fjord's fog cloud surrounding you,

02:08:05.016 --> 02:08:09.043
that these flame entities are now coming up from beneath

02:08:09.043 --> 02:08:12.486
and apparently do not undergo the same

02:08:13.643 --> 02:08:17.436
benevolence to the snow that the river itself does.

02:08:17.436 --> 02:08:18.796
One begins to burn up from below

02:08:18.796 --> 02:08:20.989
and almost sends Yasha toppling in.

02:08:22.886 --> 02:08:25.556
So what do you do?

02:08:25.556 --> 02:08:27.364
MARISHA: Run.
TALIESIN: Fly, fly, fly.

02:08:28.214 --> 02:08:29.055
ASHLEY: Do we go, do we run?

02:08:29.055 --> 02:08:31.119
LIAM: We're all in this fog cloud

02:08:31.119 --> 02:08:32.441
that's where we tied it

02:08:32.441 --> 02:08:34.836
and that thing peeked its face up underneath the fog cloud?

02:08:34.836 --> 02:08:37.123
MATT: Well, yeah, just right underneath Yasha was standing

02:08:37.123 --> 02:08:39.866
and she almost fell in and pulled back.

02:08:39.866 --> 02:08:41.756
LIAM: The only question is are we leaving just with our gem,

02:08:41.756 --> 02:08:43.526
or are we're trying to grab theirs?
TALIESIN: Fly, fly, fly!

02:08:43.526 --> 02:08:45.226
MATT: It's now rising up, and--
LAURA: Okay, okay, we go.

02:08:45.226 --> 02:08:48.476
MATT: -- as part of that,
MARISHA: Shit.

02:08:48.476 --> 02:08:50.782
MATT: -- all of you are now on fire.

02:08:50.782 --> 02:08:52.366
(screaming)

02:08:52.366 --> 02:08:54.324
LIAM: Metaphorically.
SAM: Except Fjord!

02:08:55.385 --> 02:08:57.168
Fjord, are you protected?

02:08:59.296 --> 02:09:01.449
MATT: So here's--
TALIESIN: Just Fjord Tough.

02:09:02.742 --> 02:09:04.486
SAM: Kiss the ring.

02:09:04.486 --> 02:09:06.836
MATT: So it zooms up and now

02:09:06.836 --> 02:09:10.026
you see is a full-fledged fire elemental.

02:09:10.026 --> 02:09:11.563
Has burned up from beneath the snow

02:09:11.563 --> 02:09:12.706
and the snow melts away

02:09:12.706 --> 02:09:14.096
and that one section where Yasha was standing,

02:09:14.096 --> 02:09:15.596
you guys stepped back

02:09:15.596 --> 02:09:18.716
and now there is this large, gaping, open space

02:09:18.716 --> 02:09:20.436
where it's just glowing fiery lava.

02:09:20.436 --> 02:09:23.066
The heat just immediately hits your skin

02:09:23.066 --> 02:09:24.436
and causes you to wince.

02:09:24.436 --> 02:09:26.776
And the edges of your brows begin to curl back

02:09:26.776 --> 02:09:28.786
as the hair burns away.

02:09:28.786 --> 02:09:30.696
And now this large fire elemental

02:09:30.696 --> 02:09:32.173
is right there in front of you,

02:09:32.173 --> 02:09:34.436
and it just rushes through you all immediately

02:09:34.436 --> 02:09:36.481
and you all catch fire.

02:09:36.481 --> 02:09:38.526
LAURA and SAM: Well...

02:09:38.526 --> 02:09:41.316
MATT: So!
SAM: I don't like that.

02:09:41.316 --> 02:09:45.836
MATT: You all take, well, four points of fire damage.

02:09:45.836 --> 02:09:48.078
LIAM: Fast thinking.
MATT: You take two.

02:09:48.078 --> 02:09:49.506
TALIESIN: I also-- I'm halved as well.

02:09:49.506 --> 02:09:51.226
MARISHA: And we did get a long rest, correct?

02:09:51.226 --> 02:09:53.256
LAURA: Yes, we did.
MATT: Correct.

02:09:53.256 --> 02:09:54.906
TALIESIN: Protection from fire.

02:09:54.906 --> 02:09:56.726
MATT: Indeed, so you take two damage as well,

02:09:56.726 --> 02:09:58.306
but you are still on fire,

02:09:58.306 --> 02:10:00.726
which means you have to take an action to try

02:10:00.726 --> 02:10:02.376
and put it out.

02:10:02.376 --> 02:10:04.526
And as you guys glance forward, you can see,

02:10:06.384 --> 02:10:08.956
the Tomb Takers are taking stock of this

02:10:08.956 --> 02:10:11.256
as you can see other ones starting to push

02:10:11.256 --> 02:10:12.546
through the snow around you all,

02:10:12.546 --> 02:10:15.806
and Lucien just goes, "All right, we're running."

02:10:15.806 --> 02:10:17.686
And you see him pull his blades out.

02:10:17.686 --> 02:10:21.436
And as he does, he carves them across his forearms

02:10:21.436 --> 02:10:25.461
and you see this icy material

02:10:25.461 --> 02:10:27.376
begin to build up on the outside of the blades

02:10:27.376 --> 02:10:30.006
as he prepares his ice blades and starts running.

02:10:30.006 --> 02:10:31.180
What are you guys doing?

02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:35.958
LIAM: I cast Polymorph-- Palsiesmorph on Yasha

02:10:35.958 --> 02:10:39.030
and push Veth and myself at a giant eagle.

02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:44.030
LAURA: Okay. I'll cast Polymorph
double time on me and Caduceus,

02:10:45.895 --> 02:10:48.256
and I'll pick up Fjord--

02:10:48.256 --> 02:10:50.926
MARISHA: I'll Legolas swing on top of Caduceus.

02:10:50.926 --> 02:10:55.206
LAURA: Okay and start flying, forward.

02:10:55.206 --> 02:10:56.186
MATT: You guys all just good with that?

02:10:56.186 --> 02:10:57.711
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: As we're going forward,

02:10:57.711 --> 02:10:59.756
can I keep an eye on the Tomb Takers?

02:10:59.756 --> 02:11:00.736
LAURA: Yeah, definitely.

02:11:00.736 --> 02:11:02.646
MATT: Well, you all take six points of fire damage

02:11:02.646 --> 02:11:03.759
because you're still on fire.

02:11:03.759 --> 02:11:06.136
Nobody has attempted to put it out yet.

02:11:06.136 --> 02:11:07.346
You take three, you take three.

02:11:07.346 --> 02:11:10.336
TRAVIS: I'll use a 1st-level spell to Create Water again

02:11:10.336 --> 02:11:12.726
and I'll make that rain cloud, that 30-foot cube

02:11:12.726 --> 02:11:14.609
in front of where we're going to fly through,

02:11:14.609 --> 02:11:15.684
like a car wash.
LAURA: Sick!

02:11:15.684 --> 02:11:17.417
MATT: Okay, cool.

02:11:17.417 --> 02:11:18.646
LAURA: That's sick.

02:11:18.646 --> 02:11:19.746
MATT: Yeah, I'll allow that.

02:11:19.746 --> 02:11:20.686
And so as that happens,

02:11:20.686 --> 02:11:23.986
all of you in your eagle forms take off.

02:11:23.986 --> 02:11:25.039
The spray hits you.

02:11:26.036 --> 02:11:28.826
As it does, the flames begin to turn into steam

02:11:28.826 --> 02:11:30.318
and it puts it out immediately and all of you.

02:11:30.318 --> 02:11:31.521
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

02:11:31.521 --> 02:11:34.467
MATT: Cool use of that spell!
TALIESIN: Nice.

02:11:34.467 --> 02:11:35.626
LAURA: Question.
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:11:35.626 --> 02:11:38.316
LAURA: Oh yes, and I want to to see the Tomb Takers as well.

02:11:38.316 --> 02:11:40.083
I want to see the order that they're running in.

02:11:40.083 --> 02:11:41.543
SAM: I hate it.
MATT: Go for it.

02:11:41.543 --> 02:11:43.919
MARISHA: Maybe she does better. 12 for me.

02:11:45.576 --> 02:11:48.046
My perception's balls.

02:11:48.046 --> 02:11:49.646
LAURA: 23.

02:11:49.646 --> 02:11:50.663
MATT: 23?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:11:50.663 --> 02:11:55.376
MATT: Okay. You do see as you are all just taking off

02:11:55.376 --> 02:11:56.826
in that direction upward,

02:11:56.826 --> 02:11:58.846
you're passing over the Tomb Takers

02:11:58.846 --> 02:11:59.679
and you glance down at them

02:11:59.679 --> 02:12:02.016
and you can see the other elementals flashing around.

02:12:02.016 --> 02:12:04.599
And Lucien looks up as you guys go by and he goes--

02:12:06.769 --> 02:12:08.491
Your polymorphs drop immediately.

02:12:08.491 --> 02:12:09.324
SAM: What?!

02:12:09.324 --> 02:12:10.563
LIAM: Wait, what did he do? What did he do?

02:12:10.563 --> 02:12:11.513
SAM: He canceled them.

02:12:11.513 --> 02:12:13.204
LIAM: With what, like a hand motion?

02:12:13.204 --> 02:12:14.796
MATT: He didn't make a hand motion at all.

02:12:14.796 --> 02:12:15.806
MARISHA: He just looked at it--
MATT: He just

02:12:15.806 --> 02:12:17.696
looked up at you guys and turned his head a little bit.

02:12:17.696 --> 02:12:19.674
LIAM: So there is no Counterspell even chance;

02:12:19.674 --> 02:12:20.963
it's just instant.

02:12:20.963 --> 02:12:22.081
MATT: There's no spell.

02:12:22.081 --> 02:12:24.493
LIAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Ooh, what the shit is that?!

02:12:24.493 --> 02:12:26.096
LAURA: It's anti-magic.

02:12:26.096 --> 02:12:28.986
MATT: And the polymorphs just shift and

02:12:28.986 --> 02:12:30.574
all of you are all just rising up

02:12:30.574 --> 02:12:32.716
are now continuing in an arc through the air

02:12:32.716 --> 02:12:35.416
over the Tomb Takers and are now about to collide

02:12:35.416 --> 02:12:37.616
onto the banks of the snow in front of them.

02:12:38.576 --> 02:12:40.106
Need you all to all roll acrobatics checks, please.

02:12:40.106 --> 02:12:41.589
SAM: Oh boy.

02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:43.758
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

02:12:43.758 --> 02:12:44.849
MARISHA: Slow Fall.

02:12:45.946 --> 02:12:48.239
And a natural 18 for 28 for me.

02:12:50.306 --> 02:12:52.559
TALIESIN: 13, which for me is pretty good.

02:12:52.559 --> 02:12:53.392
MATT: Okay.

02:12:53.392 --> 02:12:54.286
ASHLEY: 17.

02:12:54.286 --> 02:12:55.119
MATT: Okay.

02:12:56.076 --> 02:12:57.206
LIAM: 14.

02:12:57.206 --> 02:12:58.316
SAM: 21.

02:12:58.316 --> 02:12:59.149
LAURA: 15.

02:13:00.136 --> 02:13:02.012
(quick whoosh)

02:13:02.012 --> 02:13:03.016
MATT: Well, you all manage to tumble.

02:13:03.016 --> 02:13:05.596
You don't take any heavy damage from this.

02:13:05.596 --> 02:13:09.006
Just a mild, it'd be two points reduced to one

02:13:09.006 --> 02:13:10.607
because you all rolled pretty well, except for you.

02:13:10.607 --> 02:13:12.357
You take a full two points of bludgeoning damage

02:13:12.357 --> 02:13:13.940
and you are prone.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:15.439
LIAM: Wow.

02:13:15.439 --> 02:13:17.056
MATT: At which point, as you all like (groaning),

02:13:17.056 --> 02:13:20.716
Lucien goes, "We're staying together.

02:13:20.716 --> 02:13:22.416
"We discussed this,"

02:13:22.416 --> 02:13:24.256
and he's just running by and you can see

02:13:24.256 --> 02:13:26.098
one of the elementals swoops up

02:13:26.098 --> 02:13:28.206
from underneath behind, it leaps back.

02:13:28.206 --> 02:13:30.654
Takes two swings with his blades.

02:13:30.654 --> 02:13:32.487
(heavy die rolls)

02:13:32.487 --> 02:13:33.660
TRAVIS: That's a heavy fucking dice.

02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:34.585
MARISHA: Shit.

02:13:34.585 --> 02:13:36.556
MATT: Yeah, it's the metal one.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:13:36.556 --> 02:13:38.026
MARISHA: I don't know what to do.
MATT: Hits twice.

02:13:38.026 --> 02:13:39.019
MARISHA: Yeah, nothing.

02:13:40.224 --> 02:13:42.356
SAM: Push him in the lava.

02:13:42.356 --> 02:13:43.796
MARISHA: I mean, you said it's all about Otis.

02:13:43.796 --> 02:13:47.596
I was going to suggest we try to grab Otis, but--

02:13:47.596 --> 02:13:49.936
LAURA: Or, wait, is Otis, though?

02:13:49.936 --> 02:13:51.516
Zoran's the one carrying the bag.

02:13:51.516 --> 02:13:54.772
SAM: Yeah, but Otis is easiest one to push in the lava.

02:13:54.772 --> 02:13:56.855
(laughter)

02:13:58.496 --> 02:14:01.216
MATT: All righty. Slashes twice, and carves through the side

02:14:01.216 --> 02:14:03.576
of one of these, and you see it flickers back angrily

02:14:03.576 --> 02:14:05.466
and he just continues to go into a run.

02:14:05.466 --> 02:14:07.246
The rest of his group, getting their weapons ready

02:14:07.246 --> 02:14:09.097
you can see now as they do so,

02:14:09.097 --> 02:14:11.919
they draw blades. They're, like, small hooks

02:14:11.919 --> 02:14:14.986
or little pointed bits and bracers

02:14:14.986 --> 02:14:16.406
and hidden within gloves and elements.

02:14:16.406 --> 02:14:19.048
Where as they draw, they cut through themselves

02:14:19.048 --> 02:14:21.306
and the blood, familiar to a lot of the stuff

02:14:21.306 --> 02:14:22.326
you saw Molly do,

02:14:22.326 --> 02:14:24.636
the blood coat the edge of the blade

02:14:24.636 --> 02:14:28.129
and begin to enchant the edges of their weapons.

02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:30.896
They're all going into a run.

02:14:30.896 --> 02:14:34.556
And they're looking at you as well as like, come on.

02:14:34.556 --> 02:14:35.856
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, we go.

02:14:35.856 --> 02:14:36.689
MATT: All right.

02:14:36.689 --> 02:14:39.906
So what are you guys doing this round?

02:14:39.906 --> 02:14:40.846
MARISHA: Yeah, run, I guess.

02:14:40.846 --> 02:14:41.679
Yeah, run.

02:14:41.679 --> 02:14:43.259
MATT: All right. Fjord has to--

02:14:43.259 --> 02:14:44.666
LAURA: I'm going to help Fjord up.

02:14:44.666 --> 02:14:45.636
MATT: So you guys would be a little bit behind

02:14:45.636 --> 02:14:47.654
the rest of the group.

02:14:47.654 --> 02:14:50.349
LAURA: Does that mean the Tomb Takers
are catching up with us?

02:14:51.665 --> 02:14:53.494
So our group is ahead of the Tomb Takers.

02:14:53.494 --> 02:14:54.661
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Okay.

02:14:56.106 --> 02:14:58.440
MATT: We'll say here, this is more of just a general order

02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:00.621
of how you guys are traveling,

02:15:00.621 --> 02:15:02.749
and who's ahead, who's behind.

02:15:06.176 --> 02:15:08.039
We'll say the Tomb Takers

02:15:10.278 --> 02:15:14.089
are all catching up right about here.

02:15:15.947 --> 02:15:18.380
SAM: I feel like we're missing a person.

02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:20.517
ASHLEY: I don't think Yasha's out there.

02:15:20.517 --> 02:15:23.792
MATT: Yeah, Yasha is right up here with y'all.

02:15:24.787 --> 02:15:27.308
Oh god. Oh god.
SAM: Oh no.

02:15:27.308 --> 02:15:28.723
MATT: I'll just put them up here.

02:15:31.165 --> 02:15:33.692
SAM: Ooh, there's the Tomb Takers!

02:15:33.692 --> 02:15:35.296
TRAVIS: Where, huh?

02:15:35.296 --> 02:15:37.605
LAURA: Which ones are which?

02:15:37.605 --> 02:15:40.106
SAM: Well, you know Cree, you know Zoran.

02:15:40.106 --> 02:15:42.019
TRAVIS: I got them. (blasting)
MATT: There you go.

02:15:42.019 --> 02:15:43.250
MARISHA: (yelling)

02:15:43.250 --> 02:15:45.158
LIAM: Oh, so there's no gap at all.
They're right there with us.

02:15:45.158 --> 02:15:46.356
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, they're right there.

02:15:46.356 --> 02:15:47.796
MATT: So you guys land and slide

02:15:47.796 --> 02:15:49.086
and they're going into a run

02:15:49.086 --> 02:15:50.396
and they're just catching up right behind you

02:15:50.396 --> 02:15:51.656
as you guys are all going.

02:15:51.656 --> 02:15:53.102
So what are you doing?

02:15:53.102 --> 02:15:54.099
LIAM: We're all running at this point.

02:15:54.099 --> 02:15:55.666
LAURA: I'm going to run but I'm going to try to run

02:15:55.666 --> 02:15:58.766
just a little bit slower so that Zoran

02:15:58.766 --> 02:16:01.086
and who's coming up on my, what is that,

02:16:01.086 --> 02:16:03.811
my right side will pass by me.

02:16:03.811 --> 02:16:04.644
MATT: Okay.

02:16:04.644 --> 02:16:06.786
LAURA: But I'm looking like I'm running full speed.

02:16:06.786 --> 02:16:08.976
I'm just looking like I'm maybe not as fast

02:16:08.976 --> 02:16:10.198
as everybody else.

02:16:10.198 --> 02:16:11.706
MATT: Okay. You got it.

02:16:11.706 --> 02:16:14.606
So you are slowing down a little bit.

02:16:14.606 --> 02:16:16.176
The rest of you push forward.

02:16:16.176 --> 02:16:18.756
MARISHA: I'm going to do the opposite of what Jes is doing

02:16:18.756 --> 02:16:20.986
and I'm going to Step of the Wind

02:16:20.986 --> 02:16:24.413
and trying just full bolt ahead of everybody.

02:16:24.413 --> 02:16:26.696
MATT: You're way ahead of everybody.

02:16:26.696 --> 02:16:29.086
Fjord gets to ahead little bit.
Everyone falls behind a bit.

02:16:29.086 --> 02:16:32.856
Lucien comes up beside to you.

02:16:32.856 --> 02:16:35.122
Cree actually goes on quite a bit faster,

02:16:35.122 --> 02:16:37.126
the tabaxi form allowing that.

02:16:37.126 --> 02:16:39.726
The rest of them begin to catch up

02:16:39.726 --> 02:16:43.526
with Jester in a flanking pattern.

02:16:43.526 --> 02:16:45.709
There's other three of them around you, at that point.

02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:47.106
LAURA: Okay.

02:16:47.106 --> 02:16:48.910
MATT: All right, now you can see the elementals

02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:52.196
that began to burst through are now gliding

02:16:52.196 --> 02:16:54.186
through the snow and just carving paths.

02:16:54.186 --> 02:16:57.166
You can see the dark top

02:16:57.166 --> 02:17:00.166
as the morning light hasn't quite risen.

02:17:00.166 --> 02:17:02.416
The sun hasn't quite crested the distant mountains

02:17:02.416 --> 02:17:05.446
so it's still very dark, other than the underlit glow

02:17:05.446 --> 02:17:06.566
of the molten rock below.

02:17:06.566 --> 02:17:08.716
And it's now peeking through in spaces.

02:17:08.716 --> 02:17:10.756
And now, in its own way, is carving

02:17:10.756 --> 02:17:13.036
like somebody is drawing across

02:17:13.036 --> 02:17:16.141
the edge of a star and you can see these streaks,

02:17:16.141 --> 02:17:18.426
burning to come across your path ahead

02:17:18.426 --> 02:17:19.476
as they're intersecting

02:17:19.476 --> 02:17:22.731
and trying to find a way to keep you in the space.

02:17:22.731 --> 02:17:25.188
So they're not coming directly at you,

02:17:25.188 --> 02:17:27.536
but they're starting to
make the path ahead of you challenging.

02:17:27.536 --> 02:17:29.845
You guys continue to run forward and run forward.

02:17:29.845 --> 02:17:32.506
And there is now a couple of gaps

02:17:32.506 --> 02:17:36.181
you're going to have to jump past and not fall in.

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:37.696
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

02:17:37.696 --> 02:17:39.036
MATT: So as you all go running,

02:17:39.036 --> 02:17:42.446
I need you all to make athletics checks for me,

02:17:42.446 --> 02:17:46.106
to go ahead and just ensure that you can leap across.

02:17:46.106 --> 02:17:47.428
LIAM: Across lava?

02:17:47.428 --> 02:17:48.646
MATT: Yeah.

02:17:48.646 --> 02:17:49.546
LIAM: I'm ignoring what he did.

02:17:49.546 --> 02:17:53.198
I'm turning into a giant owl and staying low to the ground.

02:17:53.198 --> 02:17:54.846
MATT: Okay.

02:17:54.846 --> 02:17:59.846
You turn into a giant owl.
We'll say we'll use this for you.

02:17:59.926 --> 02:18:00.759
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

02:18:00.759 --> 02:18:03.276
MATT: And as long as you stay low to the ground

02:18:03.276 --> 02:18:05.359
Lucien does not cancel your form.

02:18:08.177 --> 02:18:09.540
Ah, fuck, it came out.

02:18:11.557 --> 02:18:12.390
TALIESIN: Eugh.

02:18:12.390 --> 02:18:13.228
Yep, you'll be saving me.

02:18:13.228 --> 02:18:15.503
LIAM: In fact, I'm going to-- yeah.

02:18:16.563 --> 02:18:20.182
I'm going to float, like, two feet above everyone's heads.

02:18:20.182 --> 02:18:21.616
MATT: Okay.

02:18:21.616 --> 02:18:25.576
LIAM: And I'm just-- turning as I fly.

02:18:25.576 --> 02:18:27.617
MATT: You've got it.
LIAM: Just looking for a misstep.

02:18:28.666 --> 02:18:29.506
MATT: All right.

02:18:29.506 --> 02:18:31.686
TRAVIS: Natural 20 for a 26.

02:18:31.686 --> 02:18:33.106
MATT: Nice.

02:18:33.106 --> 02:18:37.509
LAURA: A natural two, so that would be a five.

02:18:38.796 --> 02:18:39.629
MATT: All right.

02:18:42.186 --> 02:18:43.656
LIAM: Oh, I need an acrobatics as a flyer.

02:18:43.656 --> 02:18:44.959
MATT: Oh sorry, you're flying, you're fine.

02:18:44.959 --> 02:18:46.456
SAM: 18.
MATT: 18.

02:18:46.456 --> 02:18:47.289
ASHLEY: Six.

02:18:47.289 --> 02:18:48.455
MATT: Six.

02:18:48.455 --> 02:18:49.288
TALIESIN: Three.

02:18:50.856 --> 02:18:52.885
TRAVIS: Fuck, guys.
MATT: All right.

02:18:52.885 --> 02:18:55.269
MARISHA: 28.

02:18:55.269 --> 02:18:57.334
But I'm really scared for my team now.

02:18:57.334 --> 02:18:58.436
MATT: So you leap off and turn.

02:18:58.436 --> 02:19:00.836
You see them all leaping and you see some sliding

02:19:00.836 --> 02:19:02.296
as the snow sends them off-guard

02:19:02.296 --> 02:19:04.186
and their momentum shifts.
MARISHA: Yeah, I do a front aerial flip

02:19:04.186 --> 02:19:05.626
over one of the lava flows.

02:19:05.626 --> 02:19:07.576
And I turn around and I go: Come on, guys!

02:19:07.576 --> 02:19:09.822
And I see, like, three people just biff it.

02:19:09.822 --> 02:19:12.686
Yeah.
TRAVIS: Biff it.

02:19:12.686 --> 02:19:14.316
MATT: Oh shit.

02:19:14.316 --> 02:19:16.446
It's like two natural 20s in a row for the Tomb Takers.

02:19:16.446 --> 02:19:17.436
TRAVIS: Where was that shit before?

02:19:17.436 --> 02:19:18.269
MATT: I know, right.

02:19:19.416 --> 02:19:21.544
SAM: We got this.
MATT: Okay!

02:19:21.544 --> 02:19:22.793
LAURA: Zoran, save me.

02:19:22.793 --> 02:19:24.466
MATT: And he does.

02:19:24.466 --> 02:19:27.931
As you begin to fall in, you feel this big meaty hand

02:19:27.931 --> 02:19:30.186
grab the back of your coat and lift you up

02:19:30.186 --> 02:19:32.806
and set you back onto your feet scrambling ahead.

02:19:32.806 --> 02:19:34.966
LAURA: Can I use a reaction?

02:19:34.966 --> 02:19:36.666
MATT: What are you trying to do?

02:19:36.666 --> 02:19:38.076
LAURA: Using my sleight of hand,

02:19:38.076 --> 02:19:40.896
can I try to loosen the
second strap that's holding onto his--

02:19:40.896 --> 02:19:42.274
MARISHA: Yes, come, come on.
MATT: Roll sleight of hand.

02:19:42.274 --> 02:19:43.519
MARISHA: I knew that's what you were doing. Come on!

02:19:43.519 --> 02:19:44.477
TRAVIS: Wow!

02:19:47.446 --> 02:19:49.616
LAURA: Can I Guide myself on this?

02:19:49.616 --> 02:19:51.909
SAM: Don't sleight the hand that feeds ya!
MATT: It's a reaction. As a reaction, you cannot.

02:19:51.909 --> 02:19:52.742
LAURA: Okay.

02:19:56.593 --> 02:19:57.426
18.

02:19:58.329 --> 02:19:59.759
MATT: 18. Okay.

02:19:59.759 --> 02:20:02.969
As you get lifted back up, you reach over.

02:20:04.576 --> 02:20:05.716
This is real quick.

02:20:05.716 --> 02:20:06.686
This brief moment you have.

02:20:06.686 --> 02:20:10.326
And as you reach up for the strap that's right there,

02:20:10.326 --> 02:20:13.446
his hand clasps yours and says, "Just hold on."

02:20:13.446 --> 02:20:14.816
And he just keeps running.

02:20:14.816 --> 02:20:16.396
But he's clasping you there to it.

02:20:16.396 --> 02:20:18.453
So you couldn't loosen it at all

02:20:18.453 --> 02:20:20.786
and he has seemed-- he saw something,

02:20:20.786 --> 02:20:22.266
but he assumed that--
LAURA: He thought I was grabbing on to it.

02:20:22.266 --> 02:20:24.349
MATT: Just grabbing on, and so he's just holding you there.

02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:25.756
It's odd because in this moment,

02:20:25.756 --> 02:20:28.546
there is a sense of working together.

02:20:28.546 --> 02:20:29.775
That was a fucking gamble.

02:20:29.775 --> 02:20:32.723
TRAVIS: Whoosh! (glubbing)
TALIESIN: Clutch.

02:20:32.723 --> 02:20:34.516
MATT: And he's now holding you right there.

02:20:34.516 --> 02:20:37.289
As you all continue to run forward, you--

02:20:40.406 --> 02:20:41.556
ASHLEY: Die.

02:20:41.556 --> 02:20:44.376
MATT: No, the only person who was close enough

02:20:44.376 --> 02:20:45.996
to try and help you would be--

02:20:45.996 --> 02:20:47.578
TRAVIS and LAURA: Caleb.

02:20:47.578 --> 02:20:49.411
MATT: Caleb would be in that vicinity.

02:20:49.411 --> 02:20:50.516
If you want to go ahead and-- or Veth.

02:20:50.516 --> 02:20:52.316
The two of you can try to try and catch--

02:20:52.316 --> 02:20:53.675
LIAM: Where's Caduceus in there?

02:20:53.675 --> 02:20:54.774
SAM: Caduceus is farther ahead.

02:20:54.774 --> 02:20:57.346
MATT: Right there. Yasha is a little bit behind you.

02:20:57.346 --> 02:20:58.656
LIAM: And they're both going down?

02:20:58.656 --> 02:21:00.468
TRAVIS: No, Yasha, right?

02:21:00.468 --> 02:21:02.808
TALIESIN: I'm going down, too.

02:21:02.808 --> 02:21:04.321
MATT: You got to choose between Yasha or Caduceus.

02:21:04.321 --> 02:21:06.233
SAM: I'll take Yasha.
LIAM: I'll take the healer.

02:21:06.233 --> 02:21:07.886
(laughter)

02:21:07.886 --> 02:21:09.261
TRAVIS: Wow. We'll work on that later.

02:21:09.261 --> 02:21:12.616
(laughter)

02:21:12.616 --> 02:21:15.346
MATT: All right, because you are flying--

02:21:15.346 --> 02:21:17.707
MARISHA: Wow, a clear value was just stated.

02:21:17.707 --> 02:21:20.350
(laughter)

02:21:20.350 --> 02:21:21.183
TRAVIS: That was great.

02:21:21.183 --> 02:21:25.106
ASHLEY: I can heal for 11 points.
TALIESIN: I'm a living do-over, to be fair.

02:21:25.106 --> 02:21:25.939
MATT: All right.

02:21:25.939 --> 02:21:27.896
LIAM: I was a paladin; I remember those days.

02:21:27.896 --> 02:21:31.396
MATT: I just need a dexterity check from both of you.

02:21:31.396 --> 02:21:32.987
SAM: Oh, just dex.
MATT: Just a dex check

02:21:32.987 --> 02:21:35.086
using the dex of your owl as well.

02:21:35.086 --> 02:21:35.919
LIAM: Oh, okay.

02:21:37.267 --> 02:21:39.744
(fake sobbing)

02:21:39.744 --> 02:21:42.287
I don't know what the owl is, but it was a super low roll.

02:21:42.287 --> 02:21:45.070
LAURA: (chuckles)
LIAM: Um.

02:21:45.070 --> 02:21:47.666
(fake sobbing)

02:21:47.666 --> 02:21:50.034
TRAVIS: You chose poorly.

02:21:50.946 --> 02:21:51.876
SAM: I rolled a one.

02:21:51.876 --> 02:21:54.611
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:21:54.611 --> 02:21:55.444
MARISHA: That's so bad.

02:21:55.444 --> 02:21:57.118
MATT: It is an ability check.

02:21:57.118 --> 02:21:58.796
MATT: It's not.

02:21:58.796 --> 02:22:01.606
LAURA: Can't you just for once use your damn Halfling Luck?

02:22:01.606 --> 02:22:03.496
SAM: There's no skill.
MATT: This isn't Halfling Luck.

02:22:03.496 --> 02:22:05.986
SAM: I have no skill.
MATT: Oh, that's proficiency.

02:22:05.986 --> 02:22:08.046
No, it's proficiency, you're right, for the...

02:22:09.416 --> 02:22:11.949
Is that how it works for the--

02:22:11.949 --> 02:22:13.936
SAM: Yeah, I have to be proficient in the skill,

02:22:13.936 --> 02:22:16.686
but you said a dexterity check.
LIAM: You rolled a one?

02:22:16.686 --> 02:22:19.036
SAM: I am not at proficient in dexterity.

02:22:19.036 --> 02:22:19.869
MATT: That is correct.

02:22:19.869 --> 02:22:22.730
LIAM: But a halfling, when they roll a one, can re-roll.

02:22:22.730 --> 02:22:24.406
SAM: True.
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

02:22:24.406 --> 02:22:25.482
SAM: That is true.

02:22:25.482 --> 02:22:26.938
Hmm. (smacks lips)

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:28.237
It's a shame.

02:22:28.237 --> 02:22:32.968
(laughter)

02:22:32.968 --> 02:22:34.643
MATT: Yeah, proficiency bonus. Yeah, you're right.

02:22:34.643 --> 02:22:36.996
Just double checking for my own sanity.

02:22:36.996 --> 02:22:41.136
So yeah, no, you both, unfortunately. In the rush of it

02:22:41.136 --> 02:22:42.509
attempting to swoop down,

02:22:43.386 --> 02:22:45.611
Caduceus just goes down a little quicker than you thought,

02:22:45.611 --> 02:22:49.219
and Yasha, you trip and end up going over

02:22:49.219 --> 02:22:51.806
and you hit it

02:22:51.806 --> 02:22:53.236
and just pushing through the pain

02:22:53.236 --> 02:22:55.696
you continue to push forward and kick up over and land,

02:22:55.696 --> 02:22:58.857
but as you do, your leg (sizzling).
ASHLEY: Ow!

02:22:58.857 --> 02:23:02.849
MATT: And you hear Yasha's yell
scream out in the midst of this.

02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:09.016
Yeah. Let's go ahead and roll some damage here.

02:23:09.016 --> 02:23:10.633
LIAM: Remember Vax's foot?

02:23:10.633 --> 02:23:12.496
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, I do.

02:23:12.496 --> 02:23:14.964
LIAM: It took multiple games to slowly.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:23:14.964 --> 02:23:17.693
SAM: I can't use my action to help her, can I?

02:23:17.693 --> 02:23:21.226
MATT: That was your action that help her.

02:23:21.226 --> 02:23:22.526
SAM: I was going to cast-- well.

02:23:26.126 --> 02:23:30.342
ASHLEY: Do I have a reaction to try to-- well.

02:23:30.342 --> 02:23:31.842
I don't know if that'll work.

02:23:31.842 --> 02:23:34.924
MATT: You take 60 points of fire damage.

02:23:34.924 --> 02:23:35.757
LAURA: Ooh.

02:23:37.082 --> 02:23:38.569
SAM: But halved.
LIAM: Hot foot.

02:23:38.569 --> 02:23:39.402
TALIESIN: No.

02:23:39.402 --> 02:23:43.046
SAM: Because she's only half a person now.

02:23:43.046 --> 02:23:45.666
(laughter)

02:23:45.666 --> 02:23:47.249
MATT: That's awful.

02:23:50.733 --> 02:23:52.342
ASHLEY: I'm okay.

02:23:52.342 --> 02:23:53.308
Okay.
SAM: She's fine.

02:23:53.308 --> 02:23:55.453
MARISHA: ♪ Stay alive ♪
ASHLEY: Stay alive.

02:23:55.453 --> 02:23:57.010
MATT: And 50 points of fire damage to you

02:23:57.010 --> 02:23:58.684
reduced to half to 25.
SAM: You promised each other

02:23:58.684 --> 02:24:00.344
that you would stay alive!
MARISHA: -- would stay alive!

02:24:00.344 --> 02:24:02.032
(laughter)

02:24:02.032 --> 02:24:03.846
TALIESIN: Well, that sucked, and that sucked.

02:24:03.846 --> 02:24:05.026
LIAM: If I ever a roll a halfling again,

02:24:05.026 --> 02:24:07.696
I'm going to spam the shit out of that natural one rule.

02:24:07.696 --> 02:24:09.366
TALIESIN: I kind of made myself as space suit for this

02:24:09.366 --> 02:24:10.746
because I know I can't run.

02:24:10.746 --> 02:24:11.646
ASHLEY: Yeah, no, no.

02:24:11.646 --> 02:24:13.396
MATT: As you fall and hit, the magic resists it

02:24:13.396 --> 02:24:15.366
and the heat still burns you as you skid a bit

02:24:15.366 --> 02:24:16.886
and then hit the other part of the snowbank

02:24:16.886 --> 02:24:19.976
and come up and you feel singe and the pain is there,

02:24:19.976 --> 02:24:21.626
but the magic did help cushion that for you.

02:24:21.626 --> 02:24:24.486
TALIESIN: So I'm on fine ground at the moment.

02:24:24.486 --> 02:24:25.319
MATT: At the moment, you are, yeah.

02:24:25.319 --> 02:24:26.502
TALIESIN: Okay, good.
MATT: Yeah, you guys just, like,

02:24:26.502 --> 02:24:27.609
because you're running, the momentum hits

02:24:27.609 --> 02:24:29.466
and then just brief little parts

02:24:29.466 --> 02:24:32.064
even if you impact, you skid off,

02:24:32.064 --> 02:24:33.505
you continue pushing forward,
the momentum carries you.

02:24:33.505 --> 02:24:34.805
SAM: They're out of it?

02:24:34.805 --> 02:24:37.191
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Oh, easy.

02:24:37.191 --> 02:24:38.682
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: These are little things.

02:24:38.682 --> 02:24:41.236
So moving forward, you guys now reach,

02:24:41.236 --> 02:24:42.419
continuing to run,

02:24:43.386 --> 02:24:45.066
the three-quarters mark on this.

02:24:45.066 --> 02:24:47.166
What are you all doing at this juncture?

02:24:47.166 --> 02:24:49.016
MARISHA: Is there some more to go?

02:24:49.016 --> 02:24:50.843
MATT: Yeah, they're still coming up and popping through.

02:24:50.843 --> 02:24:52.746
I'm just saying, what are you doing at this moment?

02:24:52.746 --> 02:24:54.526
Right now, you just jumped past this.

02:24:54.526 --> 02:24:56.060
You've got a little bit of ground,

02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:57.433
and you can see ahead.

02:24:57.433 --> 02:24:59.356
You've made it three-fourths of the way

02:24:59.356 --> 02:25:00.826
across this river now.

02:25:00.826 --> 02:25:02.456
MARISHA: I'm kind of trying to...

02:25:04.279 --> 02:25:05.866
Because I know I'm faster

02:25:05.866 --> 02:25:07.696
than everybody else trying to...

02:25:07.696 --> 02:25:10.206
My idea was that I could forge a path a little bit.

02:25:10.206 --> 02:25:12.856
So I'm going to stop, turn around

02:25:12.856 --> 02:25:14.746
make sure my whole team is there

02:25:14.746 --> 02:25:16.890
and I'm going to continue forward

02:25:16.890 --> 02:25:18.516
and try to navigate.

02:25:18.516 --> 02:25:19.816
MATT: What you do notice.

02:25:19.816 --> 02:25:21.496
MARISHA: What do I notice?

02:25:21.496 --> 02:25:26.376
MATT: Is the elementals, all (whooshing) went below.

02:25:26.376 --> 02:25:27.824
LIAM: Oh dear.
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

02:25:27.824 --> 02:25:30.452
MATT: And right as you glance around
and look the opposite way,

02:25:30.452 --> 02:25:31.726
you see four of them now.

02:25:31.726 --> 02:25:33.806
There is this four that are active at the moment,

02:25:33.806 --> 02:25:34.639
all come up

02:25:34.639 --> 02:25:36.346
and begin sweeping in different directions

02:25:36.346 --> 02:25:38.726
in front to begin carving this large arc

02:25:38.726 --> 02:25:40.966
to block you off.
SAM: Shit.

02:25:40.966 --> 02:25:42.699
MATT: So just partially in, but it's like.

02:25:42.699 --> 02:25:45.478
You watch as they're just melting a semicircle.

02:25:45.478 --> 02:25:49.296
MARISHA: I stop and I turn and I yell to the flank

02:25:49.296 --> 02:25:51.116
as soon as I see what they're doing.

02:25:51.116 --> 02:25:54.756
And I say: Go to the angles!

02:25:54.756 --> 02:25:57.866
And try and direct people to try and maybe beat them.

02:25:57.866 --> 02:25:59.216
God, that's a terrible idea.

02:25:59.216 --> 02:26:01.739
LIAM: I hear that and preemptively grab

02:26:01.739 --> 02:26:03.916
Caduceus and Yasha by the scruff.

02:26:03.916 --> 02:26:05.786
So they have control of their arms and just lift.

02:26:05.786 --> 02:26:06.966
I don't take off into the sky

02:26:06.966 --> 02:26:07.926
because I don't want to get dropped,

02:26:07.926 --> 02:26:10.236
but will take them above the ground

02:26:10.236 --> 02:26:13.936
and start to veer to the right to try to cut off that.

02:26:13.936 --> 02:26:15.336
TALIESIN: Am I now flying?

02:26:15.336 --> 02:26:16.169
SAM: Yeah.

02:26:16.169 --> 02:26:18.194
TALIESIN: I cast Heal.
ASHLEY: (relieved sigh)

02:26:18.194 --> 02:26:19.166
MATT: Caduceus and Yasha, you said?

02:26:19.166 --> 02:26:21.076
LIAM: Yeah, because I carried two people before.

02:26:21.076 --> 02:26:22.259
ASHLEY: Heal's pretty high, right?

02:26:22.259 --> 02:26:23.656
LIAM: They're heavy.
TALIESIN: 70 points.

02:26:25.156 --> 02:26:26.781
MATT: All right.
LIAM: All better.

02:26:26.781 --> 02:26:28.236
MATT: So you guys need to drift off to that side

02:26:28.236 --> 02:26:29.069
lifting them up.

02:26:29.069 --> 02:26:30.203
MARISHA: Ten and two!

02:26:31.046 --> 02:26:32.105
MATT: The rest of you guys, what are you doing?

02:26:32.105 --> 02:26:33.708
ASHLEY: I'm currently at 70 hit points.

02:26:33.708 --> 02:26:37.049
MARISHA: Can I, since I'm still far enough ahead,

02:26:37.049 --> 02:26:40.646
does it look like a gap that I could still clear?

02:26:40.646 --> 02:26:42.946
MATT: So you're going to try and rush off
and see if you can clear the gap before it closes?

02:26:42.946 --> 02:26:45.243
MARISHA: Does it look like I can like--

02:26:45.243 --> 02:26:46.476
MATT: It's possible.

02:26:46.476 --> 02:26:47.836
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to go for it.

02:26:47.836 --> 02:26:49.461
I'm going to run.
LIAM: You could certainly try!

02:26:49.461 --> 02:26:52.816
TRAVIS: I'll cast Fly with the Star Razor.

02:26:52.816 --> 02:26:54.686
My feet just hover above the ground,

02:26:54.686 --> 02:26:57.596
but I'm also watching to see what Jester and Beau

02:26:57.596 --> 02:26:59.886
and Veth are doing.

02:26:59.886 --> 02:27:02.727
MATT: You've got it.
TRAVIS: I'm just (whooshing) waiting.

02:27:02.727 --> 02:27:03.986
MATT: Okay.

02:27:03.986 --> 02:27:05.106
So as you're running,

02:27:05.106 --> 02:27:08.076
you can lift off the ground,
and you're now hovering that space.

02:27:08.076 --> 02:27:10.126
You're going to go ahead and make your try and leap off

02:27:10.126 --> 02:27:11.719
at this angle, you said?

02:27:11.719 --> 02:27:16.616
MARISHA: I'm basically playing chicken with the elementals.

02:27:16.616 --> 02:27:18.126
MATT: You're rushing at the direction

02:27:18.126 --> 02:27:19.408
they're going to try and beat them?

02:27:19.408 --> 02:27:20.316
LIAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

02:27:20.316 --> 02:27:21.149
LIAM: Nice.

02:27:21.149 --> 02:27:22.753
MATT: With your monk speed?

02:27:22.753 --> 02:27:24.349
You don't even have to roll for it. You can beat them.

02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:25.324
MARISHA: Okay, I do that.

02:27:25.324 --> 02:27:28.394
MATT: Yeah, it'll cost you a ki point, but with your speed,

02:27:28.394 --> 02:27:30.886
you just (quick footsteps) across the ice

02:27:30.886 --> 02:27:32.427
and basically cut it off.

02:27:32.427 --> 02:27:33.696
And as they begin to carve their way past,

02:27:33.696 --> 02:27:35.171
you just emerge separately.

02:27:35.171 --> 02:27:36.656
MARISHA: Dodging a train,

02:27:36.656 --> 02:27:38.404
just jumping and dodging a train.
MATT: Which splits them.

02:27:38.404 --> 02:27:41.436
The one continues. If they were both carving a wider space,

02:27:41.436 --> 02:27:42.814
it would be harder to leap over,

02:27:42.814 --> 02:27:43.926
but now they've divided in two.

02:27:43.926 --> 02:27:45.006
One's going after you

02:27:45.006 --> 02:27:47.476
and the other one is continuing its path.

02:27:47.476 --> 02:27:50.590
Which means it gives a slight opportunity on left side

02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:52.983
to make two easier jumps as opposed to one harder one.

02:27:52.983 --> 02:27:55.366
MARISHA: Okay. I turn around and I see what's happening.

02:27:55.366 --> 02:27:58.089
I'm going to three-point landing this shit,

02:27:58.089 --> 02:28:01.139
I'm going to yell to the group and I say: Go to the left!

02:28:01.139 --> 02:28:03.296
And I'm going to try and do some sort of flourish

02:28:03.296 --> 02:28:05.306
and keep kiting the other one away.

02:28:05.306 --> 02:28:07.398
MATT: Okay, all right. You got it.

02:28:08.396 --> 02:28:10.576
LAURA: I'm going to look at Zoran,

02:28:10.576 --> 02:28:13.151
and say: I can help us get out of here.

02:28:13.151 --> 02:28:14.612
MATT: "Well then, fucking do it quick."

02:28:14.612 --> 02:28:17.979
LAURA: All right. I'm going to
polymorph also into a giant eagle.

02:28:17.979 --> 02:28:20.892
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: And I'm going to pick him up.

02:28:20.892 --> 02:28:22.006
MATT: Okay.

02:28:22.006 --> 02:28:24.682
MARISHA: Come on, come on, bitch, do something cool.

02:28:24.682 --> 02:28:25.516
MATT: All right.

02:28:25.516 --> 02:28:28.356
LAURA: I'm going to pick him up and try to hook my claws.

02:28:28.356 --> 02:28:31.323
I pick him up under the-- like, between the strap,

02:28:31.323 --> 02:28:34.606
so I could potentially be saving him,

02:28:34.606 --> 02:28:36.740
but also break the strap as I'm lifting him up.

02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:39.490
MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
LIAM: (high-pitched footsteps)

02:28:40.714 --> 02:28:42.286
TALIESIN: (sarcastically) Oh no.
MATT: Okay.

02:28:42.286 --> 02:28:44.953
SAM: You grabbing anybody else, or just him?

02:28:44.953 --> 02:28:47.086
LAURA: Sure, I'll grab-- who's right--?

02:28:47.086 --> 02:28:48.926
Is anybody else in front of me? Otis?

02:28:48.926 --> 02:28:50.199
Is Otis in front of me?

02:28:50.199 --> 02:28:51.699
SAM: Dump Otis in the--

02:28:52.726 --> 02:28:54.449
MATT: Otis would be in front of you.

02:28:54.449 --> 02:28:56.573
LAURA: I'm going to grab Otis, too, as I'm flying up.

02:28:56.573 --> 02:28:57.542
Try to help out.

02:28:57.542 --> 02:28:58.550
LIAM: That's good, that's good.

02:28:58.550 --> 02:29:01.446
LAURA: I got one claw holding Zoran, and one claw holding--

02:29:01.446 --> 02:29:02.836
MATT: I understand that.

02:29:02.836 --> 02:29:05.356
Go ahead and make a grapple check.

02:29:05.356 --> 02:29:06.346
LAURA: I'm not trying to like...

02:29:06.346 --> 02:29:07.663
I'm trying to help him.

02:29:07.663 --> 02:29:08.496
MATT: I understand.

02:29:08.496 --> 02:29:10.706
Otis doesn't see you transforming into this eagle

02:29:10.706 --> 02:29:12.286
and suddenly there is claws upon him.

02:29:12.286 --> 02:29:14.049
So they're just going to try and--

02:29:14.986 --> 02:29:16.236
LAURA: Is that a strength?

02:29:16.236 --> 02:29:18.076
MATT: Yes, that would be a strength check.

02:29:18.076 --> 02:29:18.909
LAURA: 21.

02:29:20.256 --> 02:29:22.568
MATT: Natural one. Nope you got it.
LAURA: Okay.

02:29:22.568 --> 02:29:24.314
SAM: (whispering) She's got Halfling Luck.

02:29:25.329 --> 02:29:27.412
(laughter)

02:29:28.836 --> 02:29:29.996
MATT: You don't got him.

02:29:29.996 --> 02:29:31.402
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:29:31.402 --> 02:29:33.485
(laughter)
LAURA: Okay!

02:29:34.354 --> 02:29:36.612
MARISHA: Damn it, Sam!
TRAVIS: Sam, fuck!

02:29:36.612 --> 02:29:40.286
LIAM: You didn't use yours, but you gave them theirs.

02:29:40.286 --> 02:29:43.976
MARISHA: Just join the Tomb Takers.
LIAM: Just join the Tomb Takers already!

02:29:43.976 --> 02:29:46.056
(laughter)

02:29:46.056 --> 02:29:47.361
TRAVIS: I'm an agent of chaos.

02:29:47.361 --> 02:29:49.946
(laughter)
LIAM: Instantaneously.

02:29:49.946 --> 02:29:51.726
MATT: All right, so Beau is carving them off,

02:29:51.726 --> 02:29:54.525
you have currently used your action to transform,

02:29:54.525 --> 02:29:56.333
which means you slow down a little bit,

02:29:56.333 --> 02:30:00.656
but you're holding onto Zoran underneath there,

02:30:00.656 --> 02:30:03.169
lifting up and carrying forward.

02:30:03.169 --> 02:30:05.359
Because you're slowing down a little bit in that moment.

02:30:05.359 --> 02:30:07.076
Although, what does the speed of the--

02:30:07.076 --> 02:30:08.939
LAURA: Giant eagle?
MATT: Yeah.

02:30:08.939 --> 02:30:10.587
I believe it's-- is it 60 feet?

02:30:10.587 --> 02:30:11.420
LAURA: 80 feet.

02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:13.386
MATT: 80? Oh yeah, that more than makes up for the space.

02:30:13.386 --> 02:30:15.286
So you do manage to, while you slow down

02:30:15.286 --> 02:30:17.900
to do the casting, you do jump ahead a little bit

02:30:17.900 --> 02:30:18.936
and then continuing carry that forward

02:30:18.936 --> 02:30:21.016
and you are now way ahead as well.

02:30:21.016 --> 02:30:21.849
Oh god.

02:30:21.849 --> 02:30:24.663
LIAM: I like that the owl is the eagle
and the eagle is [inaudible].

02:30:24.663 --> 02:30:26.139
LAURA: Yeah. It's great.

02:30:26.139 --> 02:30:27.715
MATT: Look.

02:30:28.748 --> 02:30:29.957
TALIESIN: It's a message, man.

02:30:29.957 --> 02:30:31.684
LIAM: DM faster, Matt!

02:30:31.684 --> 02:30:34.766
MATT: Be happy you have wings.

02:30:34.766 --> 02:30:38.071
I could've, instead, just made you riding a giant Yasha.

02:30:38.071 --> 02:30:40.154
(laughter)

02:30:41.045 --> 02:30:41.884
ASHLEY: It could work.

02:30:41.884 --> 02:30:43.466
MATT: Also viable.

02:30:43.466 --> 02:30:45.245
All right.

02:30:45.245 --> 02:30:47.979
With that, they're all going to continue moving forward,

02:30:48.893 --> 02:30:50.356
moving forward.

02:30:50.356 --> 02:30:51.766
You're way, way over here now.

02:30:51.766 --> 02:30:53.216
But they're starting to shift this direction

02:30:53.216 --> 02:30:55.566
to try and utilize the space that you've given,

02:30:57.926 --> 02:30:58.776
and shifted this way.

02:30:58.776 --> 02:30:59.926
What are you all doing?

02:31:01.556 --> 02:31:03.695
LIAM: How are we doing with the...

02:31:03.695 --> 02:31:05.406
My trio went to the right.

02:31:05.406 --> 02:31:06.516
I'm taking to the right.

02:31:06.516 --> 02:31:08.916
MATT: So to the right, it is a thick,

02:31:08.916 --> 02:31:11.036
like, almost 15-foot wide gap

02:31:11.036 --> 02:31:13.856
that they've burned across the snow.

02:31:13.856 --> 02:31:16.486
That, with their speed, they're just going full,

02:31:16.486 --> 02:31:18.506
they've basically cut you off that direction

02:31:18.506 --> 02:31:20.186
without going over it.

02:31:20.186 --> 02:31:22.966
LIAM: But I'm in the air and is there any anything

02:31:22.966 --> 02:31:24.216
burning up or smoke or anything,

02:31:24.216 --> 02:31:26.776
or is it just the snow is missing in front of us?

02:31:26.776 --> 02:31:27.609
MATT: It's just the snow.

02:31:27.609 --> 02:31:29.466
And you see steam rising as they carve through,

02:31:29.466 --> 02:31:31.589
but the glow now lights up.

02:31:31.589 --> 02:31:33.636
LIAM: I'm going to risk going up another five feet

02:31:33.636 --> 02:31:36.902
and just keep heading on an angle in that direction.

02:31:36.902 --> 02:31:39.396
I'm not trying to make it look like I'm taking off.

02:31:39.396 --> 02:31:42.303
MATT: There's no interference and you go.

02:31:42.303 --> 02:31:44.556
TALIESIN: We're nowhere near any of those creatures, right,

02:31:44.556 --> 02:31:45.916
they're not within 30 feet of us?

02:31:45.916 --> 02:31:47.856
MATT: Not at the moment.
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:31:47.856 --> 02:31:51.859
MATT: They're more interested in
preventing your travel beyond.

02:31:53.046 --> 02:31:56.576
All right. So all the people who haven't gone yet.

02:31:56.576 --> 02:31:58.328
SAM: I will grab Otis.

02:31:58.328 --> 02:32:01.666
I will reach out my hand to Otis or beckon her

02:32:01.666 --> 02:32:04.433
and be like: Come to the left, to the left!

02:32:05.878 --> 02:32:07.793
MATT: Otis nods and runs past you.

02:32:07.793 --> 02:32:12.793
SAM: And as she goes I'll cast Phantasmal Force on her.

02:32:12.876 --> 02:32:14.064
MATT: Okay.

02:32:15.182 --> 02:32:16.182
TALIESIN: (heavy sigh)

02:32:17.986 --> 02:32:20.508
LIAM: Everything you own in a box...

02:32:20.508 --> 02:32:22.296
to the left!

02:32:23.756 --> 02:32:26.679
TALIESIN: I am terrified by all of this.

02:32:26.679 --> 02:32:27.786
TRAVIS: I blame you.

02:32:27.786 --> 02:32:29.816
LAURA: I was acting like I was helping.

02:32:29.816 --> 02:32:31.966
I wasn't going to do anything outward.

02:32:31.966 --> 02:32:33.145
MATT: Natural 20.

02:32:33.145 --> 02:32:36.306
SAM: (quick inhale) Okay, cool.

02:32:36.306 --> 02:32:40.926
TALIESIN: Maybe if you had
had a little bit of luck at some point.

02:32:40.926 --> 02:32:44.656
MATT: So as you say that and Otis runs past,

02:32:44.656 --> 02:32:47.156
you whisper the incantation

02:32:47.156 --> 02:32:49.436
and Otis catches glance at you

02:32:49.436 --> 02:32:51.376
and continuing to run past

02:32:51.376 --> 02:32:53.316
because he's a doing a double move,
but you used your action.

02:32:53.316 --> 02:32:54.556
You're having to slow back a bit.

02:32:54.556 --> 02:32:57.741
So you pass each other as Otis gets ahead,

02:32:57.741 --> 02:33:00.441
and then he goes, (tsking)

02:33:00.441 --> 02:33:01.689
and continues running.

02:33:05.246 --> 02:33:07.766
Moving this way to catch up. Fjord, what are you doing?

02:33:07.766 --> 02:33:09.509
TRAVIS: I'm just flying behind them.

02:33:10.626 --> 02:33:13.066
Keeping pace with those that are question marks

02:33:13.066 --> 02:33:14.689
like Veth and Jester.

02:33:16.906 --> 02:33:18.656
MATT: All right, so keeping with them?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:33:18.656 --> 02:33:20.156
MATT: Okay, you got it.

02:33:20.156 --> 02:33:21.926
They're now all having to leap

02:33:21.926 --> 02:33:24.336
and the ones only ones who have to jump at this point

02:33:24.336 --> 02:33:28.079
are Veth, and them.

02:33:29.806 --> 02:33:31.366
So let's go ahead and do that.

02:33:31.366 --> 02:33:32.356
Because you divided it,

02:33:32.356 --> 02:33:34.906
it's two small jumps as opposed to one really hard one.

02:33:34.906 --> 02:33:37.066
So go ahead and roll twice.

02:33:37.066 --> 02:33:38.426
SAM: What am I rolling?

02:33:38.426 --> 02:33:41.816
MATT: Sorry, this would be athletics to leap across.

02:33:41.816 --> 02:33:43.021
SAM: Okay.

02:33:43.021 --> 02:33:43.854
15.

02:33:45.146 --> 02:33:47.196
And 17.

02:33:47.196 --> 02:33:48.340
MATT: Nice. Two good rolls.

02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:50.498
All right. So we'll go across the team here.

02:33:53.976 --> 02:33:54.809
Yeah.

02:33:56.216 --> 02:33:57.756
Okay.

02:33:57.756 --> 02:33:59.503
Okay, yeah, all right.

02:33:59.503 --> 02:34:01.706
So the first pass, you all run,

02:34:01.706 --> 02:34:04.026
jumping over the first arc that goes continues past

02:34:04.026 --> 02:34:06.566
as the elementals backing around to try and catch up.

02:34:06.566 --> 02:34:07.889
The second one comes up.

02:34:09.726 --> 02:34:10.559
Ooh.

02:34:15.646 --> 02:34:20.646
Okay, they all go running and leap and you watch as Cree,

02:34:21.195 --> 02:34:25.696
(sizzling) into it and rolling to one side stumbles,

02:34:25.696 --> 02:34:30.200
across the ground as quickly Lucien turns and grabs

02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:33.590
one of her hands and picks her back up and goes, "Come on!"

02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:34.690
And they all keep running.

02:34:34.690 --> 02:34:37.889
The others leap across fine, but you just see Cree's

02:34:37.889 --> 02:34:39.274
limping a bit.

02:34:40.356 --> 02:34:42.089
Cree is going to go ahead and--

02:34:47.646 --> 02:34:49.696
LAURA: It's sad because
I feel like I want to help everybody,

02:34:49.696 --> 02:34:51.239
at the same time as, like--

02:34:52.336 --> 02:34:53.169
SAM: Kill them.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:34:53.169 --> 02:34:56.959
MATT: Is going to go ahead and cast Heal--
LAURA: No, I really do, I want to, like, help them.

02:34:56.959 --> 02:34:59.142
MATT: -- on herself because Cree took...

02:35:10.126 --> 02:35:11.549
49 points of fire damage.

02:35:12.716 --> 02:35:14.696
So instead of Heal, is instead going to

02:35:14.696 --> 02:35:18.668
cast a high level Cure Wounds.

02:35:22.608 --> 02:35:24.508
Say a 3rd-level Cure Wounds.

02:35:28.313 --> 02:35:30.038
Oh, that's actually pretty decent.

02:35:34.892 --> 02:35:36.348
TRAVIS: Deck of the Enterprise.

02:35:36.348 --> 02:35:39.114
MATT: It's 29. I know. Sorry.
TRAVIS: I'm like-- No, no, no.

02:35:40.036 --> 02:35:41.216
TALIESIN: Tension is real.

02:35:41.216 --> 02:35:42.486
LAURA: Yeah.

02:35:42.486 --> 02:35:43.796
MATT: All righty.

02:35:43.796 --> 02:35:45.486
So hurt, but still running,

02:35:45.486 --> 02:35:47.336
they're all pushing. You guys are getting closer and closer.

02:35:47.336 --> 02:35:49.756
You can see the bank on the opposite side.

02:35:49.756 --> 02:35:52.986
LAURA: As soon as we cross over the embankment,

02:35:52.986 --> 02:35:57.866
the gap, I want to put Zoran down and fly low.

02:35:57.866 --> 02:36:01.966
Did my attempt at making the strap weaker with my claw

02:36:01.966 --> 02:36:03.562
do any good?

02:36:04.616 --> 02:36:06.086
MATT: You're not trying to break it right now

02:36:06.086 --> 02:36:07.336
you're just trying to make it weaker?

02:36:07.336 --> 02:36:09.306
LAURA: I'm trying to make it, like,

02:36:09.306 --> 02:36:10.706
I don't want it to snap immediately

02:36:10.706 --> 02:36:11.539
when I let him go.

02:36:11.539 --> 02:36:14.716
I want him to feel like I didn't fuck up the bag.

02:36:14.716 --> 02:36:17.126
But if it rips, it rips.

02:36:17.126 --> 02:36:17.959
MATT: Got it.

02:36:17.959 --> 02:36:20.866
LAURA: I want the bag to fall into the fucking lava.

02:36:20.866 --> 02:36:22.726
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm not trying to steal a bag,

02:36:22.726 --> 02:36:24.706
I want the bag to fall off of him.

02:36:24.706 --> 02:36:25.539
MATT: I understand.

02:36:26.446 --> 02:36:29.066
Go ahead and make a strength check for me,

02:36:29.066 --> 02:36:32.339
using the strength of your eagle form.

02:36:35.686 --> 02:36:37.956
Need to transition over because this iPad's crashing.

02:36:37.956 --> 02:36:39.356
LAURA: How do we know where is it?

02:36:39.356 --> 02:36:42.189
Okay, wait, here we go, strength.

02:36:42.189 --> 02:36:43.022
20.

02:36:43.868 --> 02:36:46.016
MATT: 20, okay.

02:36:46.016 --> 02:36:47.776
So that is some pretty,

02:36:47.776 --> 02:36:51.258
I will say some pretty decent control

02:36:51.258 --> 02:36:52.716
over the strength on this.

02:36:52.716 --> 02:36:55.046
Are you trying to sever it and hopes that it hits the lava?

02:36:55.046 --> 02:36:57.386
Or are you just trying to weaken it?

02:36:57.386 --> 02:36:58.976
You have control over this because of that roll.

02:36:58.976 --> 02:37:00.067
LAURA: Whoa.

02:37:04.506 --> 02:37:05.806
I want it to hit the lava.

02:37:06.755 --> 02:37:08.316
MATT: Okay.

02:37:08.316 --> 02:37:11.456
So as you release him, the other strap snaps

02:37:11.456 --> 02:37:13.503
and immediately begins to give way.

02:37:14.971 --> 02:37:16.887
This would be as you were...

02:37:16.887 --> 02:37:18.012
You said you set him down, right?

02:37:18.012 --> 02:37:18.845
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:22.136
MATT: Hmm.

02:37:22.136 --> 02:37:23.036
Because you carried him the other side

02:37:23.036 --> 02:37:26.096
which means there is no longer lava beneath you.

02:37:26.096 --> 02:37:29.226
So pulling the strap would mean it would fall off.

02:37:29.226 --> 02:37:30.059
Which means it wouldn't hit the lava,

02:37:30.059 --> 02:37:31.386
it just means now he has no straps

02:37:31.386 --> 02:37:33.216
so he's having to carry with his hand.

02:37:33.216 --> 02:37:34.636
So he pulls back,

02:37:34.636 --> 02:37:37.176
"Shit!" picks it up and he's just lugging it

02:37:37.176 --> 02:37:38.726
by this loose strap now.

02:37:38.726 --> 02:37:40.976
It's like the shitty backpack you had in high school

02:37:40.976 --> 02:37:42.389
that broke when you--
LAURA: All your heavy books.

02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:43.572
MATT: Yeah, and you're just clutching it.

02:37:43.572 --> 02:37:44.448
That's where he's at now.

02:37:44.448 --> 02:37:45.639
And he's running, running.

02:37:45.639 --> 02:37:47.236
The other elementals are swooping around

02:37:47.236 --> 02:37:48.896
and they're doing this wide arc carving through the snow

02:37:48.896 --> 02:37:50.186
to try and cut you off one last time

02:37:50.186 --> 02:37:51.598
before you reach the opposite bank.

02:37:51.598 --> 02:37:53.076
LAURA: Okay.

02:37:53.076 --> 02:37:54.886
So with this, what's everyone doing?

02:37:54.886 --> 02:37:56.172
MARISHA: One last time. Okay.

02:37:56.172 --> 02:37:58.618
Okay. I'm still sprinting ahead, I'm assuming.

02:37:58.618 --> 02:38:00.666
Do I still have that one hot on my ass?

02:38:00.666 --> 02:38:01.499
MATT: You do.

02:38:02.438 --> 02:38:03.313
So there's one on this side

02:38:03.313 --> 02:38:04.786
and two on this side that are looping around.

02:38:04.786 --> 02:38:05.852
This one was just catching up.

02:38:05.852 --> 02:38:09.276
But you're faster than all of them, if you want to be.

02:38:09.276 --> 02:38:11.726
MARISHA: I'll continue forward towards the embankment.

02:38:11.726 --> 02:38:13.466
I just want to keep kiting this guy

02:38:13.466 --> 02:38:15.146
and make him not a problem.

02:38:15.146 --> 02:38:16.156
So whatever direction--
MATT: So you going to shift

02:38:16.156 --> 02:38:18.731
off the side or which way?

02:38:18.731 --> 02:38:21.826
MARISHA: Yeah, can I do a big loop?

02:38:21.826 --> 02:38:23.384
MATT: You can.
MARISHA: I'll loop them wide.

02:38:23.384 --> 02:38:25.839
MATT: You can. That will carve a
path in front of everyone else.

02:38:25.839 --> 02:38:26.814
MARISHA: I don't want to do that.

02:38:26.814 --> 02:38:28.446
That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid.

02:38:28.446 --> 02:38:29.637
MATT: So you would probably go this way then.

02:38:29.637 --> 02:38:30.720
MARISHA: Fine.

02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:34.416
MATT: Okay. So Beauregard goes wide over here,

02:38:34.416 --> 02:38:36.383
while the rest of you are drifting

02:38:36.383 --> 02:38:38.066
towards where they're swirling around.

02:38:38.066 --> 02:38:39.459
It is going to cross over

02:38:39.459 --> 02:38:40.922
just barely before you guys get there

02:38:40.922 --> 02:38:42.306
at the speed that they're traveling.

02:38:42.306 --> 02:38:45.521
And cut you off with a secondary circle.

02:38:45.521 --> 02:38:49.256
One side is a single jump, thinner,

02:38:49.256 --> 02:38:51.856
the other is a lot thicker and a harder one to make.

02:38:51.856 --> 02:38:54.936
I assume everyone wants to go towards the easier side.

02:38:54.936 --> 02:38:55.856
SAM: Yes.

02:38:55.856 --> 02:38:58.548
LAURA: Is there anybody I can pick up and help over?

02:38:58.548 --> 02:39:00.048
MATT: There's numerous ones, yeah.

02:39:00.959 --> 02:39:02.513
Did you want to go ahead and--
LAURA: Yasha seems hurt.

02:39:02.513 --> 02:39:03.437
Is Yasha still hurt?

02:39:03.437 --> 02:39:04.620
LIAM: No, Caduceus has healed her.

02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:05.896
LAURA: Is Caduceus still hurt?

02:39:05.896 --> 02:39:07.374
TALIESIN: I'm fine, we're both--

02:39:07.374 --> 02:39:08.946
LIAM: Good for now and they're flying in my car.

02:39:08.946 --> 02:39:10.483
TALIESIN: I took 20 points of damage.

02:39:10.483 --> 02:39:11.316
TRAVIS: I'm fine.

02:39:12.666 --> 02:39:15.301
TALIESIN: And I'm just half damage for fire.

02:39:15.301 --> 02:39:18.259
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to pick up--

02:39:18.259 --> 02:39:20.797
Fuck it, I'm going to pick up Caduceus.

02:39:20.797 --> 02:39:22.496
LIAM: I've got Caduceus and Yasha.

02:39:22.496 --> 02:39:25.820
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to pick up Lucien.

02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:27.070
MATT: Okay!

02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:28.864
LAURA: And Veth.

02:39:28.864 --> 02:39:31.936
MATT: Okay, so you grab Lucien and Veth.

02:39:31.936 --> 02:39:33.086
As you swoop down,

02:39:33.086 --> 02:39:35.806
you can see Lucien running, blades still out, like,

02:39:35.806 --> 02:39:38.838
glances over and-- actually, doesn't even glance over,

02:39:38.838 --> 02:39:40.726
one of the eyes in the back of the neck

02:39:40.726 --> 02:39:43.496
looks up at you and the arms just go out,

02:39:43.496 --> 02:39:47.059
like preparing and you grab both of them up,

02:39:48.196 --> 02:39:51.196
lift up and as you pull them up over the way,

02:39:51.196 --> 02:39:53.996
they don't have to worry about any checks at this point.

02:39:56.176 --> 02:39:58.151
All right. And you don't have to, either,
because you're flying.

02:39:58.151 --> 02:40:00.900
That it puts it at there.

02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:01.733
LAURA: (whispering) What?

02:40:05.888 --> 02:40:08.486
MATT: Yeah, all good rolls.

02:40:08.486 --> 02:40:09.349
Oh, and Zoran.

02:40:10.706 --> 02:40:11.539
Natural 20.

02:40:13.999 --> 02:40:16.960
They all jump over the final aspect of this carved--

02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:19.530
LAURA: Is it disadvantage because
he's carrying something heavy?

02:40:19.530 --> 02:40:21.230
MARISHA: He's got-- it throws off the weight.
LAURA: That throws you off balance.

02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:22.591
It's not like a backpack.

02:40:22.591 --> 02:40:23.576
He's carrying it.

02:40:23.576 --> 02:40:25.176
MARISHA: He's got a bag of dodgeballs.

02:40:26.816 --> 02:40:28.186
SAM: Salt.

02:40:28.186 --> 02:40:29.786
MATT: He has a pretty high strength,

02:40:31.326 --> 02:40:32.803
and he rolled a natural 20.

02:40:32.803 --> 02:40:35.086
If he had failed on this,

02:40:35.086 --> 02:40:36.303
he would have lost it in the lava.

02:40:36.303 --> 02:40:37.865
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:40:37.865 --> 02:40:38.775
MATT: But he rolled a natural 20.

02:40:38.775 --> 02:40:39.783

MATT: Classic.

02:40:42.309 --> 02:40:43.912
LIAM: To underscore Matt's point.

MATT: I know.
TALIESIN: Such a good plan.

02:40:50.301 --> 02:40:53.284
MATT: It was a good setup. It was a good setup.

02:40:53.284 --> 02:40:56.836
So all you all go rush--
MARISHA: We fucked up his Jansport.

02:40:56.836 --> 02:40:58.196
MATT: As you all begin rushing up to the edge,

02:40:58.196 --> 02:41:00.116
you can see it begins to lift up.

02:41:00.116 --> 02:41:01.246
This was less of a cliff face

02:41:01.246 --> 02:41:05.156
and more of a a heavy vertical climb on a snowbank.

02:41:05.156 --> 02:41:08.146
So it's going to be challenging to climb up quickly

02:41:09.006 --> 02:41:12.016
without accidentally slipping and falling backward

02:41:12.016 --> 02:41:14.239
towards where the lava river is.

02:41:15.956 --> 02:41:19.046
So as everyone who's not currently being held

02:41:19.046 --> 02:41:22.456
by an eagle or flying, which is--

02:41:22.456 --> 02:41:24.546
No, that's all of you. Eh.

02:41:24.546 --> 02:41:26.223
That would be them. So.

02:41:26.223 --> 02:41:28.133
(laughter)

02:41:28.133 --> 02:41:29.396
MARISHA: What about me?

02:41:29.396 --> 02:41:30.326
MATT: Oh, well, you haven't gotten there.

02:41:30.326 --> 02:41:32.967
You've been chased by one of these.
MARISHA: Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

02:41:32.967 --> 02:41:34.026
MATT: And as they all reach the embankment,

02:41:34.026 --> 02:41:35.606
the other elementals have swirled around

02:41:35.606 --> 02:41:37.086
and they're all trying to make their way now

02:41:37.086 --> 02:41:38.456
towards Beauregard,

02:41:38.456 --> 02:41:41.656
who's the only one that's currently right at the area.

02:41:41.656 --> 02:41:43.409
And so we've got that going.

02:41:43.409 --> 02:41:45.592
They're all going to try and make it up the side.

02:41:48.336 --> 02:41:49.578
MARISHA: "We got that going."

02:41:52.896 --> 02:41:54.696
MATT: The only one who's in danger on that one

02:41:54.696 --> 02:41:57.126
would be Tyffial,

02:41:57.126 --> 02:42:00.246
who, trying to get up there, ends up falling back

02:42:00.246 --> 02:42:03.506
and can't seem to get past enough heavy powder

02:42:03.506 --> 02:42:05.416
and just begins to slide back to the base.

02:42:05.416 --> 02:42:07.056
But all the rest of you get up

02:42:07.056 --> 02:42:08.926
and over onto the edge of the cliff,

02:42:08.926 --> 02:42:12.366
whether it by eagle or a flying bird claw,

02:42:12.366 --> 02:42:14.716
or climb up over the side

02:42:14.716 --> 02:42:17.746
and turn back as you see Tyffial slipping back

02:42:17.746 --> 02:42:19.349
in the snow to the edge.

02:42:20.366 --> 02:42:22.946
At this point, the Tomb Takers look at each other

02:42:22.946 --> 02:42:26.636
and-- let's see what Otis has.

02:42:26.636 --> 02:42:30.161
LIAM: Is it a stable place where the group is landing?

02:42:30.161 --> 02:42:33.944
MATT: Yeah. You are outside of the danger of the lava river.

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:36.376
LIAM: And not in any danger of
sliding back down where we are?

02:42:36.376 --> 02:42:38.216
MATT: You guys are all up on the lip now.

02:42:38.216 --> 02:42:40.226
LIAM: Yep, I'm dropping, I'm dropping my form.

02:42:40.226 --> 02:42:42.519
SAM: I will cast Levitate on Tyffial.

02:42:43.396 --> 02:42:44.737
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:42:46.698 --> 02:42:48.973
MATT: As you watch as Tyffial begins to fall back

02:42:48.973 --> 02:42:50.889
at the bottom and then levitate,

02:42:50.889 --> 02:42:52.626
she begins levitate up a bit.

02:42:53.686 --> 02:42:55.711
Can't move. Is just kind of there.

02:42:55.711 --> 02:42:58.535
SAM: It's all I can do. Can someone grab her?

02:42:58.535 --> 02:43:00.876
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll fly over and
give her a nudge in the right direction.

02:43:00.876 --> 02:43:04.066
MATT: Okay, and as you do,
it's like nudging something in space.

02:43:04.066 --> 02:43:07.119
She begins to drift, hits the snow and--

02:43:08.199 --> 02:43:09.866
Have you ever-- it's like--

02:43:09.866 --> 02:43:11.074
MARISHA: Let her keep going.
MATT: Yeah.

02:43:11.074 --> 02:43:14.576
It's like a reverse hill slide,

02:43:14.576 --> 02:43:17.123
where she's hits the snow and then slides up the bank

02:43:17.123 --> 02:43:18.786
at the top of the embankment.

02:43:18.786 --> 02:43:20.986
And she continues going an angle

02:43:20.986 --> 02:43:25.986
before Zoran with his free arm
grabs the ankle and pulls her down.

02:43:26.486 --> 02:43:28.106
TRAVIS: Clocking everybody on the lip now.

02:43:28.106 --> 02:43:32.646
Is Beau still out way off on the side with the elementals?

02:43:32.646 --> 02:43:34.606
MATT: Beau is still down in the river running quickly.

02:43:34.606 --> 02:43:36.688
And as you look behind, there are now four elementals.

02:43:36.688 --> 02:43:41.494
LAURA: I'm going to drop Veth and Lucien and go after Beau.

02:43:41.494 --> 02:43:42.622
MATT: Okay. You got it.

02:43:42.622 --> 02:43:44.022
SAM: Wha-ha!
TRAVIS: That's what I was going to do.

02:43:44.022 --> 02:43:45.725
LAURA: Oh, I'm sorry.

02:43:45.725 --> 02:43:47.150
MARISHA: Aw, no!

02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:48.098
LAURA: You go, you go,

02:43:48.098 --> 02:43:49.156
you go save her.
TRAVIS: No, it's okay.

02:43:49.156 --> 02:43:50.416
You got it.

02:43:50.416 --> 02:43:51.249
LAURA: I'm sorry.

02:43:51.249 --> 02:43:53.024
MATT: Both of you are now rushing.

02:43:53.024 --> 02:43:54.362
What's your fly speed?

02:43:54.362 --> 02:43:55.228
TRAVIS: 60.
MATT: 60.

02:43:55.228 --> 02:43:57.856
Well, you actually were still cruising that same space,

02:43:57.856 --> 02:43:59.236
since you're the one that actually brought other people up

02:43:59.236 --> 02:44:01.726
and dropped them off. So you are a round ahead.

02:44:01.726 --> 02:44:03.301
So Fjord, what are you doing?

02:44:03.301 --> 02:44:06.806
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to see Beau need a hand like: Beau!

02:44:06.806 --> 02:44:09.228
MARISHA: I turn around, I see what he's doing,

02:44:09.228 --> 02:44:11.856
and I'm going to just try and meet him in the middle

02:44:11.856 --> 02:44:13.986
as I hold my arm up, as I keep running.

02:44:13.986 --> 02:44:15.556
MATT: Yeah, you move just a little bit faster

02:44:15.556 --> 02:44:17.216
with a double move at your fly speed.

02:44:17.216 --> 02:44:18.686
You move a little faster than these elementals.

02:44:18.686 --> 02:44:21.016
So as they're starting to triangulate

02:44:21.016 --> 02:44:21.849
and catch up to her,

02:44:21.849 --> 02:44:26.849
carving these four golden paths of
burning lava through the snow fields.

02:44:27.459 --> 02:44:30.016
A little bit of blue light getting brighter in the sky.

02:44:30.016 --> 02:44:31.766
You can just start seeing the tops of the snow

02:44:31.766 --> 02:44:33.796
that's still decent to step on.

02:44:33.796 --> 02:44:35.986
And as Beau's running and is starting to come up behind her,

02:44:35.986 --> 02:44:37.936
she's still keeping away from them.

02:44:37.936 --> 02:44:41.356
But they're starting to cut off any space

02:44:41.356 --> 02:44:42.566
and she's not going to go up there herself.

02:44:42.566 --> 02:44:44.846
And the embankment has now turned into cliff side.

02:44:44.846 --> 02:44:45.679
MARISHA: Oh lord.

02:44:45.679 --> 02:44:47.726
MATT: As you look back and see Fjord catching up to you,

02:44:47.726 --> 02:44:49.946
there is a moment where you can reach back and--

02:44:49.946 --> 02:44:52.996
MARISHA: I'm going to vault off of the embankment

02:44:52.996 --> 02:44:56.454
and do a back flip over the elementals

02:44:56.454 --> 02:44:57.389
and grab him.

02:44:57.389 --> 02:44:58.222
LIAM: Bullet time.

02:44:58.222 --> 02:44:59.955
MARISHA: Yeah, bullet time.
MATT: Beau,

02:44:59.955 --> 02:45:02.063
always extra. I dig it.

02:45:03.576 --> 02:45:05.098
Go ahead and make an acrobatics check for me.

02:45:05.098 --> 02:45:05.931
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:45:07.393 --> 02:45:09.387
MARISHA: Okay, 15.

02:45:09.387 --> 02:45:10.707
MATT: That's enough.

02:45:10.707 --> 02:45:11.540
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:13.606
MATT: As you run and rush--
MARISHA: Rolled low for me.

02:45:13.606 --> 02:45:14.439
MATT: -- you see that happening,

02:45:14.439 --> 02:45:16.423
you dig a heel in and begin to slide,

02:45:16.423 --> 02:45:18.073
which means you've hit an ice patch.

02:45:18.073 --> 02:45:19.278
You don't know when that patch is going to end

02:45:19.278 --> 02:45:20.633
and your feet are still in contact with the snow.

02:45:20.633 --> 02:45:22.603
And god knows if you were to actually slip beneath the

02:45:22.603 --> 02:45:25.773
surface or find an element where it was open ahead of you.

02:45:25.773 --> 02:45:26.763
But with that,

02:45:26.763 --> 02:45:29.203
you find yourself coming to the edge. You leap up,

02:45:29.203 --> 02:45:31.233
and with the momentum you hit the edge,

02:45:31.233 --> 02:45:32.423
kick off and flip backwards.

02:45:32.423 --> 02:45:34.593
The elementals are going to swoop in underneath.

02:45:34.593 --> 02:45:35.693
At that point, your arm is out.

02:45:35.693 --> 02:45:38.218
You watch as Fjord comes from the other direction.

02:45:38.218 --> 02:45:40.675
(swooshing)

02:45:40.675 --> 02:45:41.791
TRAVIS: Beastmaster.
MARISHA: (grunts)

02:45:41.791 --> 02:45:42.658
MATT: Yep.

02:45:42.658 --> 02:45:44.953
And you're lifted up. Almost the second time

02:45:44.953 --> 02:45:47.763
your arm has been jerked out of its socket in recent days,

02:45:47.763 --> 02:45:51.082
but you find yourself now lifted up in the air.

02:45:51.082 --> 02:45:55.774
As the two of you Superman the Movie fly, you know,

02:45:56.649 --> 02:45:58.556
down to meet everybody else on the edge.

02:45:58.556 --> 02:45:59.593
TRAVIS: It's not nearly that graceful.

02:45:59.593 --> 02:46:02.612
I'm holding my elbow to keep it in socket.

02:46:02.612 --> 02:46:04.488
Hold the fuck on!

02:46:04.488 --> 02:46:05.883
MATT: (whooshing)

02:46:05.883 --> 02:46:08.549
MARISHA: Beau does start to have
an inner monologue go, though.

02:46:08.549 --> 02:46:11.493
SAM: What is this feeling?
MARISHA: What is this?

02:46:11.493 --> 02:46:12.727
I feel so safe.

02:46:12.727 --> 02:46:15.723
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry)
(laughter)

02:46:15.723 --> 02:46:16.573
MARISHA: Who is this man?

02:46:16.573 --> 02:46:17.909
TRAVIS: I'm straining really hard.

02:46:17.909 --> 02:46:19.575
(laughter)

02:46:19.575 --> 02:46:20.735
TRAVIS: (blows raspberries)

02:46:20.735 --> 02:46:24.413
LIAM: I'm turtling. Got to get to the end.

02:46:24.413 --> 02:46:26.716
TRAVIS: Drop as soon as you're able. (groaning)

02:46:26.716 --> 02:46:28.432
MARISHA: Will we be together forever?

02:46:28.432 --> 02:46:30.343
(laughter)

02:46:30.343 --> 02:46:31.943
MATT: So as you all stand there for a minute

02:46:31.943 --> 02:46:34.363
on the defense, weapons drawn and at the ready,

02:46:34.363 --> 02:46:37.953
breathing heavy, seeing now the weird--

02:46:37.953 --> 02:46:39.337
SAM: Can he read my mind?

02:46:39.337 --> 02:46:41.683
MATT: -- weirdly beautiful patterns carved through the snow

02:46:41.683 --> 02:46:44.761
that give this golden sigil look to it

02:46:44.761 --> 02:46:46.143
in the way that swirls and cuts off

02:46:46.143 --> 02:46:47.633
and changes direction.

02:46:47.633 --> 02:46:50.653
All these possible deaths that awaited you on this path

02:46:50.653 --> 02:46:52.933
that you managed to avoid, as the elementals carve

02:46:52.933 --> 02:46:54.693
around again, look back angrily

02:46:54.693 --> 02:46:57.021
and then slowly sink into the lava below with

02:46:57.021 --> 02:46:59.046
(hissing)

02:46:59.046 --> 02:47:00.246
the hissing of steam.

02:47:01.253 --> 02:47:03.143
Out of breath, everyone looks around.

02:47:03.143 --> 02:47:03.976
Lucien goes,

02:47:05.521 --> 02:47:07.219
"Right. Well done.

02:47:08.098 --> 02:47:09.243
"Apologies for the rough start.

02:47:09.243 --> 02:47:13.270
"I just don't like being abandoned."

02:47:13.270 --> 02:47:16.633
LAURA: You realize you could have just told us.

02:47:16.633 --> 02:47:18.513
We could have flown across multiple times

02:47:18.513 --> 02:47:20.830
and you wouldn't have had to deal with any of that.

02:47:21.850 --> 02:47:24.260
MATT: "Hindsight 20/20 and all that."

02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:27.552
MARISHA: (incredulous humming)
TALIESIN: Oh, I get that.

02:47:27.552 --> 02:47:29.384
ASHLEY: Perspective.

02:47:29.384 --> 02:47:31.158
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:47:31.158 --> 02:47:33.070
ASHLEY: That's a good example of that.

02:47:34.103 --> 02:47:36.629
I have my foot jammed into the snow.

02:47:36.629 --> 02:47:38.363
MATT: Yeah. (chuckling)

02:47:38.363 --> 02:47:42.398
It's throbbing pain.

02:47:42.398 --> 02:47:44.223
TALIESIN: It's to be red and boily for a while,

02:47:44.223 --> 02:47:45.573
but at least it's there.

02:47:45.573 --> 02:47:46.998
ASHLEY: Yeah. It hurts, but--

02:47:46.998 --> 02:47:48.814
I'll be fine.
TALIESIN: Yeah, you'll want to put something on that.

02:47:48.814 --> 02:47:50.085
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: A compress.

02:47:50.085 --> 02:47:53.163
TRAVIS: Because we don't expect a terrible devious intent

02:47:53.163 --> 02:47:55.583
on your part with where we're heading,

02:47:55.583 --> 02:47:57.573
maybe do include us a bit more

02:47:57.573 --> 02:47:59.003
in your planning and strategy.

02:47:59.003 --> 02:48:02.560
We have, as you can see, quite a bit to offer.

02:48:03.970 --> 02:48:04.970
MATT: "You're not wrong.

02:48:07.253 --> 02:48:10.880
"Well, let's talk a bit as we walk."

02:48:13.153 --> 02:48:14.303
And as you all can look at each other

02:48:14.303 --> 02:48:17.063
and Lucien begins to put his weapons back,

02:48:17.063 --> 02:48:19.013
on the sides, everyone begins to collect.

02:48:19.993 --> 02:48:22.253
Zoran hefts the pack up now,

02:48:22.253 --> 02:48:23.600
and he's clutching the loose--

02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:25.733
LAURA: Oh, Zoran, I'm so sorry.

02:48:25.733 --> 02:48:27.902
Thank you for saving me.

02:48:27.902 --> 02:48:30.833
MATT: "Thank you for for saving me." (grunts)

02:48:30.833 --> 02:48:33.134
He begins trudging off and all of you look back,

02:48:33.134 --> 02:48:35.853
except for you look over at Otis who's just going--

02:48:37.923 --> 02:48:39.926
SAM: Ha. Hi.

02:48:39.926 --> 02:48:40.876
LIAM: Oh, yeah.

02:48:40.876 --> 02:48:42.323
SAM: Didn't, uh--

02:48:43.193 --> 02:48:44.383
didn't die, huh?

02:48:44.383 --> 02:48:46.690
Neither of us died. That's good.

02:48:49.749 --> 02:48:53.075
MATT: And just turns around and follows after Lucien.

02:48:53.075 --> 02:48:54.774
SAM: (exhales)

02:48:54.774 --> 02:48:57.174
LAURA: (laughs)

02:48:58.068 --> 02:49:00.015
MATT: As you guys continue on,

02:49:00.015 --> 02:49:02.803
for the remainder of your second day of travel,

02:49:02.803 --> 02:49:04.434
I would like somebody to roll another d20 for me.

02:49:04.434 --> 02:49:05.517
LIAM: That's me.

02:49:07.003 --> 02:49:09.373
Colville meteorite die!

02:49:09.373 --> 02:49:10.873
Five.

02:49:10.873 --> 02:49:11.931
MATT: Five.

02:49:11.931 --> 02:49:13.533
TALIESIN: Oh no, not five.

02:49:13.533 --> 02:49:14.653
LAURA: Anything but five!

02:49:14.653 --> 02:49:16.319
SAM: Five alive.

02:49:16.319 --> 02:49:17.719
TRAVIS: [Inaudible] Five.
SAM: <i>Fünf</i>.

02:49:17.719 --> 02:49:19.463
SAM: 25.

02:49:19.463 --> 02:49:20.296
TALIESIN: Input.

02:49:21.293 --> 02:49:24.403
MATT: Heavy ice fog, unfortunately, does swell

02:49:24.403 --> 02:49:27.583
on this side of the lava bank,

02:49:27.583 --> 02:49:29.250
lowering visibility.

02:49:32.223 --> 02:49:33.153
I need everybody to go ahead

02:49:33.153 --> 02:49:35.363
and make a group survival check.

02:49:35.363 --> 02:49:38.853
See if they can trek through and maintain direction on this.

02:49:38.853 --> 02:49:41.354
LIAM: Damn it, Colville.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:49:41.354 --> 02:49:42.902
LIAM: North is that way, I know..

02:49:42.902 --> 02:49:44.886
LAURA: Hmm.
TALIESIN: Oh yay.

02:49:46.736 --> 02:49:49.594
TRAVIS: 20. That's a minus.

02:49:49.594 --> 02:49:51.129
17.

02:49:51.129 --> 02:49:51.971
MATT: 17.

02:49:51.971 --> 02:49:55.073
LIAM: Does my Keen Mind have any effect on this roll?

02:49:55.073 --> 02:49:56.503
MATT: In this instance, no.

02:49:56.503 --> 02:49:58.271
LIAM: Then a natural one.

02:49:59.613 --> 02:50:02.253
MATT: Because this is not about looking at the--

02:50:02.253 --> 02:50:03.144
Keen Mind usually is like,

02:50:03.144 --> 02:50:04.356
look around at the surroundings, look at the sky.

02:50:04.356 --> 02:50:05.922
You have no visibility here

02:50:05.922 --> 02:50:08.376
and it's not a magical innate ability.

02:50:08.376 --> 02:50:09.453
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: Cheers.

02:50:09.453 --> 02:50:11.693
TRAVIS: So natural one. Got it.

02:50:11.693 --> 02:50:13.050
LAURA: Oh, 19.
MATT: 19.

02:50:13.050 --> 02:50:14.623
SAM: 12.
MATT: 12.

02:50:14.623 --> 02:50:16.132
ASHLEY: 23.

02:50:16.132 --> 02:50:17.304
TALIESIN: 13.

02:50:17.304 --> 02:50:18.279
LIAM: If only I was a halfling--
MARISHA: 15.

02:50:18.279 --> 02:50:20.276
LIAM: -- and could reroll that die.

02:50:20.276 --> 02:50:21.734
MATT: Not looking good.

02:50:21.734 --> 02:50:24.933
TALIESIN: I like low rolls for this.

02:50:24.933 --> 02:50:27.333
MATT: Now for Tomb Takers.

02:50:27.333 --> 02:50:28.993
TALIESIN: Oh no, we're lost.
MATT: Not good.

02:50:28.993 --> 02:50:30.803
TRAVIS: Shake some bad rolls--
MATT: Not good.

02:50:30.803 --> 02:50:32.073
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: I like that.

02:50:32.073 --> 02:50:34.639
MATT: Yeah, that's the tipping point.

02:50:34.639 --> 02:50:37.903
You spend most of the day lost.

02:50:37.903 --> 02:50:40.481
Trekking forward--
MARISHA: They rolled shitty?

02:50:40.481 --> 02:50:42.156
MATT: It was a high DC on this,

02:50:42.156 --> 02:50:43.722
and you guys did not roll great

02:50:43.722 --> 02:50:46.086
and they did not roll great.
TALIESIN: Yes!

02:50:46.086 --> 02:50:49.452
MATT: The natural one was two failures on the skill test.

02:50:50.502 --> 02:50:52.576
So nothing terrible happens.

02:50:54.063 --> 02:50:56.293
But what happens is it does add an additional day

02:50:56.293 --> 02:50:58.363
of travel to this journey.

02:50:58.363 --> 02:51:01.088
And the next day you all will have a point of exhaustion.

02:51:01.088 --> 02:51:02.615
TRAVIS: Fuck!
LIAM: (groans)

02:51:02.615 --> 02:51:04.940
MARISHA: Lucien, are sure you know where you're going?

02:51:06.575 --> 02:51:09.717
MATT: "You know, these lands are a bit strange."

02:51:09.717 --> 02:51:10.550
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:51:11.466 --> 02:51:13.223
MATT: "And I think we're all trying to guide each other

02:51:13.223 --> 02:51:15.223
"in a very incorrect direction."

02:51:15.223 --> 02:51:19.650
MARISHA: No. No, we're all
following you as the de facto leader.

02:51:19.650 --> 02:51:22.291
We are not all following each other. We're following you.

02:51:22.291 --> 02:51:23.624
MATT: "I don't know. It seems like quite a bit of you

02:51:23.624 --> 02:51:25.553
"are making your own paths as well.

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:28.077
"Yes, I'm lost, all right!"

02:51:28.077 --> 02:51:30.852
(laughter)

02:51:32.593 --> 02:51:33.770
"You don't have to be a dick about it!"

02:51:33.770 --> 02:51:35.048
(laughter)

02:51:35.048 --> 02:51:36.389
SAM: She's like this no matter--

02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:38.978
MARISHA: I out-douchebagged Lucien!

02:51:38.978 --> 02:51:40.065
TRAVIS: I like him more.

02:51:40.065 --> 02:51:43.153
MATT: You do see he is filled with frustration.

02:51:43.153 --> 02:51:46.195
This is the first time he's--

02:51:46.195 --> 02:51:48.370
The first time he's had to show a little bit of limitation

02:51:48.370 --> 02:51:50.143
and he's not happy about it.

02:51:50.143 --> 02:51:51.687
LIAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: Relatable.

02:51:51.687 --> 02:51:52.520
LIAM: He's mortal.

02:51:52.520 --> 02:51:53.653
ASHLEY: I like it.

02:51:53.653 --> 02:51:56.066
SAM: She's like this a lot. It's okay.
You'll get used to it.

02:51:56.066 --> 02:51:57.607
TALIESIN: Now we know what do get him for Winter's Crest.

02:51:57.607 --> 02:51:58.631
LIAM: Yeah, it's like a hazing.

02:51:58.631 --> 02:52:01.222
TALIESIN: A compass.
LIAM: It's like a hazing process.

02:52:01.222 --> 02:52:04.101
TRAVIS: (laughs) That would be so fucking salty.

02:52:04.101 --> 02:52:07.103
MARISHA: Get him a compass!

02:52:07.103 --> 02:52:08.851
TRAVIS: All the eyes. (explosion)

02:52:08.851 --> 02:52:09.780
(laughter)

02:52:09.780 --> 02:52:11.343
MATT: "Well, we've all had a day.

02:52:11.343 --> 02:52:13.473
"Let's go ahead and bed down.

02:52:13.473 --> 02:52:14.653
"Take a rest here in a safe spot

02:52:14.653 --> 02:52:16.200
"and we'll continue on first thing in the morning."

02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:18.844
TRAVIS: Do you need help finding your bed or should we--

02:52:18.844 --> 02:52:20.278
(laughter)

02:52:20.278 --> 02:52:23.214
Just kidding. A little humor between friends.

02:52:23.214 --> 02:52:25.260
(nervous laughter)

02:52:25.260 --> 02:52:27.153
ASHLEY: Wait, I actually have a question about that

02:52:27.153 --> 02:52:28.903
because when--

02:52:29.883 --> 02:52:30.983
Do you sleep?

02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:34.956
MATT: "Not for a while."

02:52:34.956 --> 02:52:36.132
TALIESIN: Huh.

02:52:36.132 --> 02:52:40.230
MATT: "One of the many gifts to the Somnovum.

02:52:42.613 --> 02:52:45.790
"More time to think, to contemplate and to watch."

02:52:46.850 --> 02:52:48.880
TALIESIN: I like sleeping.
LAURA: (whispering) Me too.

02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:50.300
LIAM: Yeah, do you miss the dreaming?

02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:52.800
MATT: "Oh, I can still dream."

02:52:54.145 --> 02:52:55.570
LAURA: Ooh!

02:52:55.570 --> 02:52:59.353
Wait, do, like, some of the Somnovum sleep

02:52:59.353 --> 02:53:00.923
while others are awake?

02:53:00.923 --> 02:53:02.243
So, like, part of you is sleeping

02:53:02.243 --> 02:53:04.873
while other parts-- is that how it works?

02:53:04.873 --> 02:53:06.940
Do you work in cycles like--?

02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:08.522
LIAM: Are you dreaming right now?

02:53:08.522 --> 02:53:10.270
(laughter)

02:53:10.270 --> 02:53:11.103
MATT: "Not at the moment,

02:53:11.103 --> 02:53:12.883
"but I wouldn't mind some perhaps in a bit

02:53:12.883 --> 02:53:15.880
"if we can get a bit more comfortable."

02:53:15.880 --> 02:53:17.849
SAM: Well, we can't do that.

02:53:17.849 --> 02:53:20.580
It's snowy out here. Sorry.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.723
MATT: "Well, let's set up,"

02:53:23.723 --> 02:53:26.920
and they go ahead and begin carving snow away.

02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:28.829
TALIESIN: We can't make our super comfortable tent, can we?

02:53:28.829 --> 02:53:32.762
SAM: Sure, we can but do we
want to share that with these fuckers?

02:53:34.490 --> 02:53:37.156
LIAM: Yeah, we're able to, but--

02:53:37.156 --> 02:53:38.350
TALIESIN: I mean--

02:53:38.350 --> 02:53:39.910
TRAVIS: It's your tower.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:53:42.008 --> 02:53:44.153
You probably have to ask for permission

02:53:44.153 --> 02:53:46.130
otherwise he might just negate it and--

02:53:46.970 --> 02:53:47.823
TALIESIN: What do you think?

02:53:47.823 --> 02:53:49.673
MARISHA: I'm also fine just doing the dome

02:53:49.673 --> 02:53:52.895
if you feel like it'll reveal our cards.

02:53:52.895 --> 02:53:54.953
(stress ball pop)

02:53:54.953 --> 02:53:55.786
LAURA: Did you just toot?

02:53:55.786 --> 02:53:57.207
TRAVIS: No, That was the (stress ball pop)

02:53:57.207 --> 02:53:59.457
(laughter)

02:54:00.443 --> 02:54:01.732
I broke another one.

02:54:01.732 --> 02:54:04.298
(laughter)
MATT and MARISHA: Oh no!

02:54:04.298 --> 02:54:07.656
(laughter)

02:54:07.656 --> 02:54:09.308
TRAVIS: My chair's all wet.

02:54:09.308 --> 02:54:11.825
ASHLEY: Oh no.
SAM: Aw.

02:54:11.825 --> 02:54:14.825
MATT: Oh, buddy!
TALIESIN: Should we just buy a box of them?

02:54:14.825 --> 02:54:16.943
SAM: Someone must make a really hardcore stress--

02:54:16.943 --> 02:54:19.004
TRAVIS: I think it could happen to anyone.

02:54:19.004 --> 02:54:22.098
(laughter)

02:54:22.098 --> 02:54:24.780
MATT: Just going to have like a little dog pad

02:54:24.780 --> 02:54:26.446
down before you start.
TRAVIS: I might need that.

02:54:26.446 --> 02:54:27.320
Super absorbent.
LAURA: -- paper towels

02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:29.651
right there on the side of your table.

02:54:29.651 --> 02:54:31.821
TRAVIS: I'm just [inaudible]. It's okay.
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

02:54:33.125 --> 02:54:36.023
SAM: (blows raspberry)
MATT: So what's the plan?

02:54:36.023 --> 02:54:37.360
TALIESIN: I mean, it's your call.

02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:38.343
LIAM: I guess we'll

02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:44.308
take a little space for ourselves and put up the dome.

02:54:44.308 --> 02:54:45.141
MATT: "Very well.

02:54:47.303 --> 02:54:48.633
"Sleep well.

02:54:48.633 --> 02:54:49.943
"It looks like our journey is going to go

02:54:49.943 --> 02:54:51.760
"a little longer than anticipated."

02:54:54.233 --> 02:54:56.643
And they all begin to build up their sleeping arrangements

02:54:56.643 --> 02:54:57.863
not far from the dome.

02:54:57.863 --> 02:55:00.443
LIAM: Okay, so I lead the group about 40 or 50 feet away

02:55:00.443 --> 02:55:02.725
and I start to cast the mansion--

02:55:02.725 --> 02:55:03.558
TRAVIS: Yes, motherfucker!

02:55:03.558 --> 02:55:05.733
LIAM: -- the tower with my back to them,

02:55:05.733 --> 02:55:07.753
with a wand in front of me

02:55:07.753 --> 02:55:10.623
and my back directly between their group and me.

02:55:10.623 --> 02:55:11.456
Takes a minute

02:55:12.913 --> 02:55:15.550
and I wait and I just look at everybody.

02:55:18.208 --> 02:55:19.993
(fast whooshing)

02:55:19.993 --> 02:55:21.505
And I lead everybody in really fast.

02:55:21.505 --> 02:55:22.443
TRAVIS: (loud footsteps)

02:55:22.443 --> 02:55:23.393
SAM: Does it work?

02:55:23.393 --> 02:55:26.183
LIAM: And then I dropped the door and it disappears.

02:55:26.183 --> 02:55:27.016
MATT: Okay.

02:55:29.224 --> 02:55:31.273
SAM: Oh boy.

02:55:31.273 --> 02:55:32.176
Oh boy.

02:55:34.803 --> 02:55:36.543
MATT: You all step into the mansion.

02:55:36.543 --> 02:55:38.293
The door appears closed behind you.

02:55:40.203 --> 02:55:41.303
You're in the mansion.

02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:48.000
LIAM: Okay, so this is a bit of an experiment.

02:55:49.492 --> 02:55:51.003
They may be aware that we are in here

02:55:51.003 --> 02:55:53.003
and are just allowing for it.

02:55:53.003 --> 02:55:54.303
And even if that is the case,

02:55:54.303 --> 02:55:56.273
we can get a hot meal and a comfortable time

02:55:56.273 --> 02:55:58.353
and enjoy our rooms.

02:55:58.353 --> 02:55:59.313
And then we continue on,

02:55:59.313 --> 02:56:02.123
but we have as much time as we need to think

02:56:02.123 --> 02:56:03.380
and talk and plan.

02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:05.105
TRAVIS: Up!
LAURA: Wait--

02:56:05.105 --> 02:56:07.203
(laughter)

02:56:07.203 --> 02:56:09.117
(whooshing)

02:56:09.117 --> 02:56:10.653
SAM: Fjord, we were about to talk.

02:56:10.653 --> 02:56:12.815
LIAM: Tell them to brew some coffee.

02:56:12.815 --> 02:56:15.470
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no. Sorry.

02:56:15.470 --> 02:56:20.293
LAURA: Before they undo this,

02:56:20.293 --> 02:56:23.280
I have Word of Recall prepared if you do, too, Caduceus.

02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:24.588
SAM: What does that do?

02:56:24.588 --> 02:56:25.650
TRAVIS: What is that?

02:56:25.650 --> 02:56:27.253
LAURA: We could potentially bamf us all

02:56:27.253 --> 02:56:29.120
back to Xhorhas right now.

02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:30.090
TRAVIS: From here?

02:56:30.090 --> 02:56:31.720
LAURA: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:33.140
LAURA: I don't know if it would work.

02:56:33.140 --> 02:56:34.100
TALIESIN: It might not.

02:56:34.100 --> 02:56:36.290
SAM: We're in a different dimension right now.

02:56:36.290 --> 02:56:37.233
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter.

02:56:37.233 --> 02:56:40.680
SAM: So maybe the rules of Eiselcross don't pertain.

02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:41.580
MARISHA: That's an interesting thought.

02:56:41.580 --> 02:56:43.694
TRAVIS: Would we want to? Is that something we want to do?

02:56:43.694 --> 02:56:44.527
LIAM: Well, that's the question.

02:56:44.527 --> 02:56:47.455
That is a brilliant, that is a brilliant use here.

02:56:47.455 --> 02:56:52.364
But if we leave, they spend another week or so

02:56:52.364 --> 02:56:54.273
finding another one of these things,

02:56:54.273 --> 02:56:56.413
even two or three weeks,

02:56:56.413 --> 02:56:58.082
we're not going to bamf back here.

02:56:58.082 --> 02:56:59.763
We're going to have to travel back slowly.

02:56:59.763 --> 02:57:02.732
So we are no longer a fly in their ointment.

02:57:02.732 --> 02:57:04.180
TRAVIS: Yeah, we be calling their bet.

02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:06.185
MARISHA: We can't bamf back here you mean--

02:57:06.185 --> 02:57:07.343
TALIESIN: No, we've got a way out,

02:57:07.343 --> 02:57:08.358
we don't have a way back.

02:57:08.358 --> 02:57:11.118
MARISHA: Okay, I think that's a great idea.

02:57:11.118 --> 02:57:13.045
MATT: You're welcome to try.
MARISHA: I think we save that ticket.

02:57:13.045 --> 02:57:14.236
LAURA: Yeah.

02:57:14.236 --> 02:57:15.223
LIAM: We definitely can try.

02:57:15.223 --> 02:57:19.639
And I've been picking up stones every day

02:57:19.639 --> 02:57:23.401
and wrapping them in a paper and labeling them.

02:57:23.401 --> 02:57:24.659
MARISHA: To bring us back here, you mean?

02:57:24.659 --> 02:57:27.523
LIAM: Well, if I have something from a location,

02:57:27.523 --> 02:57:31.583
it makes it a little safer to bamf there.

02:57:31.583 --> 02:57:33.405
So every day I take a little--
MARISHA: You're collecting soil jars?

02:57:33.405 --> 02:57:35.147
LIAM: I have a little sorting system

02:57:35.147 --> 02:57:37.220
and I take a little something with me every day.

02:57:37.220 --> 02:57:38.311
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

02:57:38.311 --> 02:57:41.092
ASHLEY: It can be anything?

02:57:41.092 --> 02:57:42.823
LIAM: Anything from the location.

02:57:42.823 --> 02:57:44.573
So I generally look for--

02:57:44.573 --> 02:57:47.923
I mean, I have underwear, a turtle,

02:57:47.923 --> 02:57:50.599
but for a place like this, it's just small rocks.

02:57:50.599 --> 02:57:53.328
MARISHA: Why underwear? Out of all things?

02:57:53.328 --> 02:57:54.575
LIAM: Because Veth.

02:57:54.575 --> 02:57:55.690
MARISHA: Oh.

02:57:55.690 --> 02:57:57.285
SAM: I had some extra.

02:57:57.285 --> 02:57:58.750
(chuckling)

02:57:58.750 --> 02:58:01.177
TALIESIN: Well--

02:58:01.177 --> 02:58:02.010
LIAM: But it's still a gamble.

02:58:02.010 --> 02:58:04.510
TALIESIN: It's still a gamble and things can go very wrong.

02:58:04.510 --> 02:58:05.343
LAURA: Yeah.

02:58:05.343 --> 02:58:07.703
It basically would be letting them

02:58:07.703 --> 02:58:08.669
do what they're going to do--

02:58:08.669 --> 02:58:10.313
TALIESIN: We can't communicate with anybody.

02:58:10.313 --> 02:58:12.272
We can't message anybody from in here, can we?

02:58:12.272 --> 02:58:14.570
LAURA: No, we can. I can send messages.

02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:17.220
SAM: But we're not sure if they can hear in here.

02:58:17.220 --> 02:58:20.080
LAURA: No.
MARISHA: You shouldn't be able to though, right?

02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:21.710
SAM: If we invited them in, Caleb,

02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:25.183
there's no way that you can mentally construct this place to

02:58:25.183 --> 02:58:29.472
have isolated chambers where no one can hear anything can--

02:58:30.755 --> 02:58:34.126
LIAM: I mean, I cannot predict what he--

02:58:34.126 --> 02:58:36.653
Lucien is able to do.

02:58:36.653 --> 02:58:38.603
But I can reconfigure this, to an extent.

02:58:38.603 --> 02:58:39.746
I mean, it is a tower.

02:58:41.973 --> 02:58:44.406
And I can segment, I can separate, I can lock,

02:58:45.743 --> 02:58:47.023
but I don't want to bring them in here.

02:58:47.023 --> 02:58:48.763
Even if we don't go anywhere,

02:58:48.763 --> 02:58:51.256
at least we get a night to ourselves.

02:58:52.133 --> 02:58:52.966
SAM: Yeah.

02:58:52.966 --> 02:58:55.332
LIAM: At least we regain a little bit of control.

02:58:55.332 --> 02:58:57.226
TRAVIS: (anxious exhalations) Boy.

02:58:57.226 --> 02:58:59.990
LAURA: They might be really angry when we come out.

02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:02.104
LIAM: Yeah, well. Fuck 'em.

02:59:02.104 --> 02:59:04.243
TALIESIN: They could've killed us on the spot,

02:59:04.243 --> 02:59:05.130
if they'd wanted to.
LAURA: True.

02:59:05.130 --> 02:59:07.650
TALIESIN: Just added a week to their reality without us.

02:59:07.650 --> 02:59:10.150
MARISHA: Can they dispel this tower at any moment?

02:59:10.150 --> 02:59:11.550
LIAM: I don't know.
TALIESIN: Maybe.

02:59:13.043 --> 02:59:14.982
I assume we would just flop out.

02:59:14.982 --> 02:59:18.315
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: Comically.

02:59:18.315 --> 02:59:21.415
SAM: You can't teleport an object, can you?

02:59:21.415 --> 02:59:22.897
LIAM: Sure, I can.

02:59:22.897 --> 02:59:25.560
SAM: So we can tell teleport--
LIAM: Yes, I could.

02:59:25.560 --> 02:59:29.553
SAM: -- the threshold crest to Lady Allura Vysoren

02:59:29.553 --> 02:59:31.160
or something if we wanted to?

02:59:32.637 --> 02:59:34.350
MARISHA: Teleport it out, but we stay here?

02:59:34.350 --> 02:59:35.893
LIAM: The easiest thing to do is to send it

02:59:35.893 --> 02:59:37.993
somewhere we have been,

02:59:37.993 --> 02:59:39.892
but I could wing it, yeah.

02:59:39.892 --> 02:59:42.443
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea

02:59:42.443 --> 02:59:45.673
because we could continue to just operate like we have it.

02:59:45.673 --> 02:59:47.610
And as long as he doesn't know.

02:59:47.610 --> 02:59:49.200
SAM: But then what if he does?

02:59:49.200 --> 02:59:51.253
TALIESIN: Well.
SAM: What if we walk out the door and he's like,

02:59:51.253 --> 02:59:53.520
"Ah, ah, ah!

02:59:53.520 --> 02:59:55.663
(intentionally bad Irish accent)
"You don't have something with you

02:59:55.663 --> 02:59:59.027
"right now that you had before."

02:59:59.027 --> 03:00:00.310
TALIESIN: Then we'd have to go get another one.

03:00:00.310 --> 03:00:02.048
LAURA: That was good, Veth. That was believable.

03:00:02.048 --> 03:00:04.886
SAM: "I can sense it's not on ya."

03:00:04.886 --> 03:00:06.483
TRAVIS: Woof.

03:00:06.483 --> 03:00:08.429
TALIESIN: I cast Dispel on the illusion.

03:00:08.429 --> 03:00:11.060
(laughter)

03:00:11.060 --> 03:00:12.933
SAM: (okay Irish accent)
It's been me the whole time.

03:00:12.933 --> 03:00:16.050
(laughter)

03:00:16.050 --> 03:00:18.247
MARISHA: Okay. So yeah, let's work that out.

03:00:18.247 --> 03:00:19.193
If we come out and he's like,

03:00:19.193 --> 03:00:21.926
(intentionally bad Irish accent) "Ooh, I don't smell ye--"

03:00:21.926 --> 03:00:24.350
LAURA: Oh, wow, both of you are really--

03:00:24.350 --> 03:00:25.650
MARISHA: (laughing) Threshold crest.

03:00:25.650 --> 03:00:27.874
LIAM: That is a perfect impression.
TALIESIN: Are we fighting pirates now?

03:00:27.874 --> 03:00:29.399
Is that what is happening?
TRAVIS: Keep going, keep going.

03:00:29.399 --> 03:00:32.355
Finish your thoughts.
MARISHA: (okay Irish accent) He's an Irish pirate.

03:00:32.355 --> 03:00:35.217
TRAVIS: Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it.

03:00:35.217 --> 03:00:36.613
LIAM: Very authentic.
TALIESIN: All right, carry on.

03:00:36.613 --> 03:00:39.000
MARISHA: So if he's like, (growling
voice) "You don't got it--"

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:42.346
(laughter)

03:00:42.346 --> 03:00:44.802
SAM: (growling) 'You don't got it!'

03:00:44.802 --> 03:00:47.385
MATT: (growling voice) Wolfman Jack, the ol' big bad!
TRAVIS: Dive deeper, dive deeper.

03:00:47.385 --> 03:00:49.799
Keep going. It's in there.
(laughter)

03:00:49.799 --> 03:00:51.785
(laughter)

03:00:51.785 --> 03:00:53.953
MARISHA: Then we're like, "Oh no!"

03:00:53.953 --> 03:00:55.733
And we have to go get another crest, right?

03:00:55.733 --> 03:00:57.523
SAM: Or he slices all of our throats and we die.

03:00:57.523 --> 03:00:59.113
LAURA: He'll be angry if he realizes

03:00:59.113 --> 03:01:00.163
we don't actually have anything,

03:01:00.163 --> 03:01:01.724
but at least he won't be able

03:01:01.724 --> 03:01:03.392
to take it from our dead bodies.

03:01:03.392 --> 03:01:05.200
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: (deep exhaling)

03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:07.440
SAM: There'll be some cold comfort in that.

03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:08.273
TALIESIN: Why didn't--

03:01:08.273 --> 03:01:11.833
I mean, they could have just killed half of us back there

03:01:11.833 --> 03:01:14.583
and they didn't and they would still have access to it.

03:01:15.653 --> 03:01:17.043
I don't think that--

03:01:17.043 --> 03:01:18.890
I don't think the crest is keeping us safe.

03:01:18.890 --> 03:01:20.704
I think it's more complicated than that.

03:01:20.704 --> 03:01:22.580
LIAM: Well, I think that we would slow them down

03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:23.630
but not stop them.

03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:24.953
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:28.160
SAM: Or we could just drink hot cocoa and go to bed.

03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:30.323
TALIESIN: I like the idea of teleporting it far away

03:01:30.323 --> 03:01:31.673
to somebody who might be able to help--

03:01:31.673 --> 03:01:33.056
ASHLEY: Me, too.
TALIESIN: -- with a note.

03:01:33.056 --> 03:01:35.650
TRAVIS: There aren't a lot of
arguments against <i>not</i> doing that.

03:01:35.650 --> 03:01:37.030
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm not against it, either.

03:01:37.030 --> 03:01:39.430
SAM: We could at least just send it to Essek.

03:01:40.394 --> 03:01:42.060
At least it's on continent.

03:01:42.060 --> 03:01:43.952
TALIESIN: I would get it to a whole 'nother place.

03:01:43.952 --> 03:01:46.293
SAM: But that way at least we know we can get it

03:01:46.293 --> 03:01:48.465
if we need it soon.

03:01:48.465 --> 03:01:49.298
TRAVIS: If he gives it back.

03:01:49.298 --> 03:01:50.843
LAURA: But we haven't been to where Essek is.

03:01:50.843 --> 03:01:54.793
I don't think that it's as easy to teleport it there

03:01:54.793 --> 03:01:57.623
as it is to teleport it to...

03:01:58.756 --> 03:01:59.685
MARISHA: Yussa?
TALIESIN: Nicodranas.

03:01:59.685 --> 03:02:00.518
LIAM: Yeah.

03:02:00.518 --> 03:02:02.420
LAURA: I feel like Yussa is dangerous, but--

03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:03.903
MARISHA: Yudala Fon. We can put it in the hands

03:02:03.903 --> 03:02:05.863
of the Cobalt Soul.

03:02:05.863 --> 03:02:07.766
SAM: Vess De-- Oh, no.

03:02:07.766 --> 03:02:09.573
TALIESIN: I think we need someone...

03:02:10.877 --> 03:02:12.485
LIAM: We could send it--
TALIESIN: -- chaotic.

03:02:13.610 --> 03:02:17.097
LIAM: -- to Nicodranas and you could tell Allura where it is

03:02:17.097 --> 03:02:17.930
LAURA: Yeah.

03:02:17.930 --> 03:02:19.230
LIAM: Because I have--

03:02:20.310 --> 03:02:23.383
I can't say what's going to happen here in Eiselcross.

03:02:23.383 --> 03:02:25.243
But we could send it there and you could definitely talk

03:02:25.243 --> 03:02:27.259
to her and she could get it lickety-split.

03:02:27.259 --> 03:02:28.494
LAURA: Okay.

03:02:28.494 --> 03:02:30.473
MARISHA: And then Allura would do what?

03:02:30.473 --> 03:02:32.640
Take it to another continent?

03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:34.213
LAURA: Who knows what she would do with it.

03:02:34.213 --> 03:02:36.230
Maybe it's best that we wouldn't know.

03:02:37.465 --> 03:02:39.543
TALIESIN: Alerting forces that something bad was coming--

03:02:39.543 --> 03:02:41.140
coming down the--

03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:44.050
MARISHA: I mean, we have more connection with Yussa.

03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:48.050
SAM and ASHLEY: (quiet laughter)

03:02:48.050 --> 03:02:50.750
LAURA: And she trusted him, right?

03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:52.543
TALIESIN: I think it's the right choice.

03:02:52.543 --> 03:02:53.653
I think we need--

03:02:54.602 --> 03:02:57.640
I think your people are too--

03:02:57.640 --> 03:02:59.150
MARISHA: Connected?
TALIESIN: -- slow.

03:02:59.150 --> 03:03:00.390
LAURA: Maybe we send it to Yussa.

03:03:00.390 --> 03:03:02.340
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: I just--

03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:05.033
I just worry that even if he doesn't slice our throats

03:03:05.033 --> 03:03:07.283
because he doesn't want to kill us,

03:03:07.283 --> 03:03:09.243
that if we go out there without it,

03:03:09.243 --> 03:03:11.033
he'll somehow sense it and be like,

03:03:11.033 --> 03:03:12.953
"Why are you fuckers with me?

03:03:12.953 --> 03:03:13.953
"I don't need you anymore. Bye."

03:03:13.953 --> 03:03:14.903
TRAVIS: Let's think about that part.

03:03:14.903 --> 03:03:17.493
Like if the Bag of Holding is another dimension, right?

03:03:17.493 --> 03:03:20.690
Another plane, a pocket plane, he can't, right?

03:03:20.690 --> 03:03:23.080
You can't see something in another dimension.

03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:24.820
LAURA: You can't, even if I'm scrying on somebody,

03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:26.403
if they're not in this plane of existence,

03:03:26.403 --> 03:03:27.350
I can't see that.

03:03:27.350 --> 03:03:29.240
SAM: He's got eyes that do all kinds of stuff.

03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:30.964
LAURA: That's true.

03:03:30.964 --> 03:03:33.093
But if he knew where it was the whole time,

03:03:33.093 --> 03:03:34.270
why didn't he just take it?

03:03:34.270 --> 03:03:37.336
MARISHA: Exactly.
ASHLEY: Yeah, and I feel-- Yeah.

03:03:37.336 --> 03:03:39.038
MARISHA: And he's mentioned himself, he's like,

03:03:39.038 --> 03:03:43.236
(growling voice) "Ooh, you serve a
bigger purpose to this, (growls)"

03:03:43.236 --> 03:03:44.227
So, you know--

03:03:44.227 --> 03:03:45.803
TALIESIN: That's a good Bane.
(laughter)

03:03:45.803 --> 03:03:49.156
TRAVIS: You see life very interestingly.

03:03:49.156 --> 03:03:50.846
Your filter is incredible.
MARISHA: He's a big baddy!

03:03:50.846 --> 03:03:52.920
SAM and MARISHA: (growling)

03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:54.043
MARISHA: I'm a dinosaur.

03:03:54.043 --> 03:03:54.876
I'm Lucien.

03:03:54.876 --> 03:03:55.709
(laughter)

03:03:55.709 --> 03:03:56.810
TALIESIN: (Bane voice) --could be my reckoning.

03:03:56.810 --> 03:03:59.013
LIAM: Maybe he thinks that does not need to break a sweat.

03:03:59.013 --> 03:04:00.993
After all, he dropped us from the sky

03:04:00.993 --> 03:04:03.080
with no effort at all.

03:04:03.080 --> 03:04:06.181
MARISHA: We are floating on his ego right now.

03:04:06.181 --> 03:04:07.563
And I want to keep it that way.

03:04:07.563 --> 03:04:09.263
He thinks that he's better than us.

03:04:09.263 --> 03:04:10.553
And he's underestimating us.

03:04:10.553 --> 03:04:13.013
The more we keep him in that sweet spot.

03:04:13.013 --> 03:04:14.963
The better we'll be.

03:04:14.963 --> 03:04:17.632
It means he can be surprised.

03:04:18.707 --> 03:04:20.919
LIAM: He looked pretty pissed off earlier today.

03:04:20.919 --> 03:04:22.527
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: And then we--

03:04:22.527 --> 03:04:24.593
MATT: (knocking)
TALIESIN: -- got him over a bank--

03:04:24.593 --> 03:04:25.734
(gasps)
MARISHA: Wait, how could

03:04:25.734 --> 03:04:27.209
he knock on the fucking door?

03:04:27.209 --> 03:04:29.640
LAURA: Do it, do it now, Caleb.

03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:31.540
LIAM: Gotta get it out.

03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:32.610
TRAVIS: Do you want to?

03:04:32.610 --> 03:04:33.935
LAURA: He's going to dispel it.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:04:33.935 --> 03:04:35.675
LAURA: He's going to dispel the tower.

03:04:35.675 --> 03:04:38.050
MARISHA: Should we answer the door to deflect?
LAURA: We should answer the door.

03:04:38.050 --> 03:04:40.063
(continued knocking)
Otherwise, he's going to dispel it.

03:04:40.063 --> 03:04:41.096
LIAM: Yeah.

03:04:41.096 --> 03:04:43.991
TRAVIS: Amber comes out. Hand it to Caleb.

03:04:43.991 --> 03:04:46.127
LAURA: No, no.
LIAM: I put it. No, no--

03:04:46.127 --> 03:04:47.998
Keep it the bag.

03:04:47.998 --> 03:04:51.122
Put it back in the bag.
SAM: He drops it on the floor.

03:04:51.122 --> 03:04:53.907
MARISHA: Fjord, answer the door. Make him go away.
LIAM: The wall underneath one of the giant--

03:04:53.907 --> 03:04:55.933
Because were still down in the giant entry hall

03:04:55.933 --> 03:04:58.073
with the stained glass windows, just sort of shimmers,

03:04:58.073 --> 03:05:00.313
and now there is (whooshing)

03:05:00.313 --> 03:05:02.500
and we see him in the snow, I assume?

03:05:02.500 --> 03:05:06.976
MATT: You do. Standing outside and doing this--

03:05:09.430 --> 03:05:10.863
LIAM: How can I help you?

03:05:12.473 --> 03:05:13.706
TRAVIS: You can talk to it?

03:05:15.155 --> 03:05:19.878
MATT: "I was just curious as to
where this strange portal led."

03:05:22.416 --> 03:05:23.713
LIAM: This is my house.

03:05:23.713 --> 03:05:27.083
We are going to have a comfortable night before trudging

03:05:27.083 --> 03:05:30.849
through the bleak frozen north tomorrow.

03:05:30.849 --> 03:05:31.682
MATT: "Ah.

03:05:34.123 --> 03:05:36.023
"Didn't mention you had a home before."

03:05:37.020 --> 03:05:39.310
LIAM: Have you told us everything?

03:05:39.310 --> 03:05:41.160
MATT: "No, but you've told me so little."

03:05:43.196 --> 03:05:45.083
LIAM: Well, I have a tower that I carry around in my pocket

03:05:45.083 --> 03:05:46.513
and only we fit in here.

03:05:46.513 --> 03:05:48.940
Thank you. We'll see you in the morning. (fast whooshing)

03:05:48.940 --> 03:05:50.757
SAM: (nervous chuckling)
LAURA: Oh no.

03:05:50.757 --> 03:05:53.603
SAM: Oh no. Oh no.
TRAVIS: I don't know. I don't know.

03:05:53.603 --> 03:05:56.313
MATT: There is a brief moment of anxiety

03:05:57.423 --> 03:06:00.573
before suddenly you're surrounded by a cold sensation

03:06:00.573 --> 03:06:04.353
as all of you (thumps) fall onto the icy snow,

03:06:04.353 --> 03:06:08.982
hands and knees thrust from the interior of the tower.

03:06:08.982 --> 03:06:10.123
LIAM: What a dick.

03:06:10.123 --> 03:06:12.256
MATT: Lucien standing there above and goes,

03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:16.386
"I was just curious, but

03:06:17.513 --> 03:06:19.743
"once again, trust has to be earned

03:06:20.733 --> 03:06:23.353
"and there's been a few actions in the past day or so,"

03:06:23.353 --> 03:06:26.342
looking over towards Veth--
TRAVIS: (giggling)

03:06:26.342 --> 03:06:27.996
"That had me a bit on edge.

03:06:29.093 --> 03:06:31.993
"And so when there isn't a forthright discussion,

03:06:31.993 --> 03:06:34.813
"I have reason to believe that there's some funny business

03:06:36.053 --> 03:06:38.103
"and you still have something that I need.

03:06:39.173 --> 03:06:41.093
"So why don't you come join us by the fire

03:06:41.093 --> 03:06:43.763
"or make your fancy dome once more.

03:06:43.763 --> 03:06:44.803
"This--

03:06:44.803 --> 03:06:46.253
"this makes me uncomfortable."

03:06:47.302 --> 03:06:49.355
TALIESIN: I was going to have a hot meal.

03:06:49.355 --> 03:06:50.596
(chuckling)

03:06:50.596 --> 03:06:52.156
ASHLEY: I was going to have a--

03:06:52.156 --> 03:06:56.739
(laughter)

03:06:56.739 --> 03:06:58.199
SAM and TALIESIN: Hot meal?

03:06:58.199 --> 03:06:59.562
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:06:59.562 --> 03:07:04.504
(laughter)

03:07:05.463 --> 03:07:07.004
ASHLEY: That's okay.

03:07:07.004 --> 03:07:08.233
Let's just spend another night

03:07:08.233 --> 03:07:10.232
in the see-through dome all together.

03:07:10.232 --> 03:07:12.410
(laughter)

03:07:12.410 --> 03:07:15.244
TRAVIS: You know, if it'll help, I have Marine Layer.

03:07:15.244 --> 03:07:19.761
(laughter)

03:07:19.761 --> 03:07:24.023
(fog horn sound)
(laughter)

03:07:24.023 --> 03:07:25.212
TRAVIS: Hotbox the dome.

03:07:25.212 --> 03:07:29.378
(laughter)

03:07:29.378 --> 03:07:30.906
SAM: (coughing)

03:07:30.906 --> 03:07:34.364
(laughter)

03:07:40.513 --> 03:07:42.500
TRAVIS: Cool. Cool, cool.

03:07:42.500 --> 03:07:45.280
SAM: Well, I guess we'll just join you by the fire then.

03:07:45.280 --> 03:07:48.750
TRAVIS: Or the dome, right?
SAM: Dome near the fire?

03:07:48.750 --> 03:07:50.650
LIAM: Are you comfortable with the dome?

03:07:51.950 --> 03:07:54.040
MATT: "That is a bit more comfortable."

03:07:54.040 --> 03:07:56.893
MARISHA: To be fair, I feel like he did disclose

03:07:56.893 --> 03:07:59.888
what we were going to do.

03:07:59.888 --> 03:08:01.753
Said we were going to take a night to ourselves

03:08:01.753 --> 03:08:04.430
in our own house.

03:08:04.430 --> 03:08:05.730
So fine.

03:08:07.370 --> 03:08:09.158
MATT: "This isn't an argument of semantics here.

03:08:09.158 --> 03:08:10.840
"This is just being careful."

03:08:12.301 --> 03:08:14.943
MARISHA: Well, you keep talking about trust

03:08:14.943 --> 03:08:18.333
and it definitely feels like it's a one-way street

03:08:18.333 --> 03:08:20.598
in this situation so--

03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:25.823
SAM: We saved two of your compatriots today.

03:08:25.823 --> 03:08:28.053
You saw me save your compatriot's life

03:08:28.053 --> 03:08:29.291
and she turned into--

03:08:29.291 --> 03:08:32.040
she burned a spell to save one of yours.

03:08:32.040 --> 03:08:34.285
LAURA: Two of you, actually.

03:08:34.285 --> 03:08:35.910
You're welcome.

03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:37.649
MATT: "Thank you."
LAURA: Yeah.

03:08:37.649 --> 03:08:39.356
MATT: Just looks back at you again.

03:08:43.320 --> 03:08:45.109
"Well, set up you own.

03:08:46.421 --> 03:08:47.585
"Rest well."

03:08:51.434 --> 03:08:53.103
He turns around and begins walking back

03:08:53.103 --> 03:08:54.303
to the rest of the crew.

03:08:55.543 --> 03:08:59.883
You can see his patient presentory demeanor

03:08:59.883 --> 03:09:03.637
that he's continued to bring

03:09:03.637 --> 03:09:07.933
is dropping steadily with each altercation.

03:09:07.933 --> 03:09:09.993
The patience is wearing thinner and thinner

03:09:09.993 --> 03:09:11.743
with each conversation.

03:09:11.743 --> 03:09:13.438
TRAVIS: We have that affect on people.

03:09:13.438 --> 03:09:14.598
(murmurs of agreement)

03:09:15.456 --> 03:09:17.604
MARISHA: Kind of like it.

03:09:17.604 --> 03:09:20.140
(exhaling dejectedly)

03:09:20.140 --> 03:09:22.420
TRAVIS: The dome is better than nothing, no?

03:09:22.420 --> 03:09:24.490
LAURA: Yeah. At least it's warm in the dome.

03:09:30.057 --> 03:09:32.726
LIAM: I walk off towards the Tomb Takers.

03:09:32.726 --> 03:09:33.559
MATT: Okay.

03:09:34.609 --> 03:09:37.483
LIAM: I grabbed Beau by the wrist and drag her behind me.

03:09:37.483 --> 03:09:39.517
MATT: Okay. As you approach, you can see they

03:09:39.517 --> 03:09:41.433
set their things on the side,

03:09:41.433 --> 03:09:44.640
pulled out some elements to eat.

03:09:44.640 --> 03:09:45.473
Just now the--

03:09:45.473 --> 03:09:47.023
at this point in the day,

03:09:47.023 --> 03:09:50.533
the light is beginning to change into sunset

03:09:50.533 --> 03:09:51.696
after a strong, you know,

03:09:51.696 --> 03:09:55.180
eight hours of trudging through difficult terrain

03:09:56.463 --> 03:09:59.762
and being caught in that terrible fog.

03:09:59.762 --> 03:10:01.496
And as you approach, they all glance over

03:10:01.496 --> 03:10:03.523
and Lucien has taking a seat back

03:10:03.523 --> 03:10:08.523
on this slight, little depression in the snow,

03:10:08.770 --> 03:10:11.530
in like a leisurely stretch, and just goes--

03:10:14.730 --> 03:10:17.672
LIAM: So we don't like each other.

03:10:18.872 --> 03:10:21.189
You don't like us, we don't like you.

03:10:21.189 --> 03:10:23.513
But we are working towards the same thing.

03:10:23.513 --> 03:10:26.713
We have similar goals and we have days left

03:10:26.713 --> 03:10:28.663
before we reach our destination.

03:10:29.962 --> 03:10:31.132
Tomorrow,

03:10:32.013 --> 03:10:33.363
you all may have a hot meal

03:10:34.233 --> 03:10:37.133
and a bed and cat massages

03:10:37.133 --> 03:10:39.111
and anything you can dream of

03:10:40.642 --> 03:10:42.176
if we can work together.

03:10:43.450 --> 03:10:44.856
And we do not know what you are doing.

03:10:45.890 --> 03:10:47.933
MATT: "See now, that there would have been a great way

03:10:47.933 --> 03:10:50.100
"to start the night's conversation."

03:10:53.577 --> 03:10:56.856
LIAM: You have been keeping us captive for multiple nights.

03:10:57.783 --> 03:11:00.263
You started this on the wrong foot.

03:11:00.263 --> 03:11:02.723
You make an effort to keep us from bolting

03:11:02.723 --> 03:11:05.606
at the first chance we have.
MARISHA: (snaps fingers in agreement)

03:11:06.880 --> 03:11:08.353
MATT: "I'm not keeping you from bolting.

03:11:08.353 --> 03:11:09.895
"If you want to leave, you can leave."

03:11:09.895 --> 03:11:14.710
MARISHA: How do you reckon you can say that?

03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:17.763
LIAM: Right, we'll just take this precious package

03:11:17.763 --> 03:11:18.953
that you care so much about

03:11:18.953 --> 03:11:20.470
and we'll just head off on our own, yeah?

03:11:20.470 --> 03:11:22.290
MATT: "Your presence is a convenience."

03:11:22.290 --> 03:11:24.693
MARISHA: You have thwarted every spell

03:11:24.693 --> 03:11:27.886
we have put forward to simply survive.

03:11:29.443 --> 03:11:34.420
Tell us how we are not captives in this situation.

03:11:36.750 --> 03:11:37.766
MATT: "I'm careful.

03:11:38.773 --> 03:11:42.513
"Especially around practitioners of magic.

03:11:42.513 --> 03:11:44.563
"Have a bit of a history.

03:11:44.563 --> 03:11:49.563
"Especially those that walked alongside such individuals.

03:11:49.616 --> 03:11:52.603
"Pardon me if I mistrust of certain aspects

03:11:52.603 --> 03:11:56.063
"of the arcane that, I don't know,

03:11:56.063 --> 03:11:58.603
"might be hanging out in the unspoken wings

03:11:58.603 --> 03:12:00.013
"of our arrangement.

03:12:00.013 --> 03:12:01.256
"So I'm careful.

03:12:04.543 --> 03:12:06.313
"I'm not offering for you to leave,

03:12:06.313 --> 03:12:07.346
"but if you were,

03:12:08.823 --> 03:12:09.873
"it would be annoying.

03:12:10.833 --> 03:12:12.686
"What you have isn't so precious.

03:12:14.503 --> 03:12:15.336
"It's just convenient."

03:12:15.336 --> 03:12:18.043
LIAM: Let's save some time. Here's what I propose.

03:12:18.043 --> 03:12:19.321
I'm very curious.

03:12:19.321 --> 03:12:22.066
I love books and learning.

03:12:23.353 --> 03:12:24.803
Show me your book.

03:12:24.803 --> 03:12:27.693
Don't give it to me. Show it to us.

03:12:27.693 --> 03:12:28.963
Let us look at together--

03:12:28.963 --> 03:12:31.473
look at it together and try to ascertain

03:12:31.473 --> 03:12:33.536
what it is you have been unable to.

03:12:35.243 --> 03:12:38.276
You can stop us from leaving at any time, it seems.

03:12:39.133 --> 03:12:41.893
Share a little bit more of your knowledge.

03:12:41.893 --> 03:12:43.546
Enjoy a bed tomorrow night.

03:12:46.313 --> 03:12:47.213
What do you have to lose?

03:12:47.213 --> 03:12:49.403
We can't leave. We've tried twice.

03:12:49.403 --> 03:12:51.865
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.
TRAVIS: (sharp inhales)

03:12:51.865 --> 03:12:54.286
MARISHA: Can I give advantage being here?

03:12:55.523 --> 03:12:56.915
SAM: You're so persuasive.

03:12:56.915 --> 03:12:59.660
MARISHA: I am <i>so</i> persuasive.

03:12:59.660 --> 03:13:01.417
MATT: I would say this is a straight roll for him.

03:13:01.417 --> 03:13:02.813
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.

03:13:02.813 --> 03:13:04.253
LAURA: Ms. Combative.
MARISHA: If anything--

03:13:04.253 --> 03:13:05.903
If anything, I'd make is worse.
TRAVIS: Which one will it be?

03:13:05.903 --> 03:13:08.083
Which one will it be?

03:13:08.083 --> 03:13:09.193
TALIESIN: Cracking your knuckles.

03:13:09.193 --> 03:13:10.206
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

03:13:11.343 --> 03:13:12.793
LIAM: 25.
TRAVIS: Ooh!

03:13:12.793 --> 03:13:14.766
TALIESIN: Whoa!
SAM: Jesus!

03:13:14.766 --> 03:13:16.978
LAURA: (anxious whistling)

03:13:18.020 --> 03:13:19.070
MATT: "I'll think on it."

03:13:21.610 --> 03:13:23.195
MARISHA: When?
(laughter)

03:13:23.195 --> 03:13:25.611
Like tonight--
MATT: "Tonight while I rest."

03:13:25.611 --> 03:13:28.561
TRAVIS: You're going to give him disadvantage.
MATT: "I hate you!"

03:13:28.561 --> 03:13:30.060
(laughter)

03:13:30.060 --> 03:13:31.698
MARISHA: A hundred percent I am!

03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:35.436
How many more days till Aeor?

03:13:36.520 --> 03:13:38.951
MATT: "Two. How do you travel with this one?"

03:13:38.951 --> 03:13:39.787
(snickering)

03:13:39.787 --> 03:13:42.060
MARISHA: They've learned to deal.
LAURA: It gets better.

03:13:42.060 --> 03:13:43.185
MARISHA: Exactly.

03:13:43.185 --> 03:13:44.760
Conditioning, motherfucker!

03:13:44.760 --> 03:13:46.543
LIAM: The hazing process is a little steep,

03:13:46.543 --> 03:13:48.243
but once you make it through that,

03:13:48.243 --> 03:13:49.663
you grow quite fond of her.

03:13:49.663 --> 03:13:51.354
I use a cantrip and start to make food appear in the fire

03:13:51.354 --> 03:13:55.079
I use a cantrip and start to make food appear in the fire

03:13:55.079 --> 03:13:57.323
and cats and books,

03:13:57.323 --> 03:14:01.803
(beatboxing) and books and cats and books and cats.
(laughter)

03:14:01.803 --> 03:14:03.893
LIAM: And all the things that they will enjoy

03:14:03.893 --> 03:14:06.262
in the tower tomorrow night.

03:14:06.262 --> 03:14:08.543
All of that can be yours.

03:14:08.543 --> 03:14:09.376
Talk to your leader.

03:14:09.376 --> 03:14:13.023
LAURA: Also, I do tarot card readings.

03:14:13.023 --> 03:14:14.806
That could be fun.

03:14:14.806 --> 03:14:17.686
MARISHA: Jester's just also here. (laughter)

03:14:17.686 --> 03:14:18.702
TRAVIS: Bing!

03:14:18.702 --> 03:14:19.898
LAURA: I've been here the whole time.

03:14:19.898 --> 03:14:21.942
I said was following you guys.
LIAM: I didn't hear that.

03:14:21.942 --> 03:14:23.503
LAURA: I just wasn't talking, okay.

03:14:23.503 --> 03:14:26.562
MATT: As you both walk away and she bursts out.

03:14:26.562 --> 03:14:28.137
Immediately attention shifts and goes,

03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:31.880
"See, now that's a nice offer."

03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:34.480
LAURA: Do you want me to read your tarot cards?

03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:35.895
MATT: "Certainly."

03:14:35.895 --> 03:14:37.513
LAURA: Really?

03:14:37.513 --> 03:14:39.343
You know, I learned this from Molly.

03:14:39.343 --> 03:14:41.830
Does that change your opinion of it?

03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:43.307
MATT: "No. I'm just curious."

03:14:43.307 --> 03:14:44.140
LAURA: Okay!

03:14:45.198 --> 03:14:46.031
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:14:46.031 --> 03:14:48.496
LAURA: Oh, well then, sit down with me.
MARISHA: No--

03:14:48.496 --> 03:14:51.869
LAURA: And we'll sit down across from Lucien.
MARISHA: (stammering)

03:14:51.869 --> 03:14:55.993
LIAM: I grab Beau by the wrist just to quiet her.

03:14:55.993 --> 03:14:58.401
LAURA: Hold on. I got to pull up my list.

03:14:59.918 --> 03:15:02.075
Give me a second.

03:15:02.075 --> 03:15:03.143
MATT: He sits in front of you.

03:15:03.143 --> 03:15:06.453
His swords clanging to the side.

03:15:06.453 --> 03:15:07.673
LAURA: I'll take out the deck of cards

03:15:07.673 --> 03:15:11.603
and I'll fan them out in front of him and say,

03:15:11.603 --> 03:15:15.189
Choose-- (blowing raspberry)

03:15:15.189 --> 03:15:16.608
three cards?

03:15:16.608 --> 03:15:18.683
(snickering)

03:15:18.683 --> 03:15:21.952
MATT: His head cocks to the side, reading very clearly the--

03:15:21.952 --> 03:15:22.913
LAURA: (laughs)

03:15:22.913 --> 03:15:26.255
MATT: -- the lack of confidence in the delivery.

03:15:26.255 --> 03:15:28.403
LAURA: Set them in order in front of you.

03:15:28.403 --> 03:15:31.714
LIAM: The Empire kids share the most deadpan--

03:15:31.714 --> 03:15:32.680
MATT: He does so.

03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:36.365
LAURA: Okay. Roll a d20, sir.

03:15:41.873 --> 03:15:42.715
MATT: Nine.

03:15:42.715 --> 03:15:46.296
LAURA: Oh, how fucking perfect.

03:15:46.296 --> 03:15:47.129
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:15:47.129 --> 03:15:48.770
MATT: Fucking game. I swear to god.
LAURA: Oh wow.

03:15:48.770 --> 03:15:52.923
Okay, so flip over the first card.

03:15:52.923 --> 03:15:55.933
This is the card of your past.

03:15:55.933 --> 03:15:57.766
And I look down at it.

03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:02.683
This card--

03:16:02.683 --> 03:16:05.207
TALIESIN: You can pick--
TRAVIS: (burps)

03:16:05.207 --> 03:16:07.457
(laughter)
LAURA: It's so weird.

03:16:08.693 --> 03:16:13.197
This card is History and The Dream.

03:16:13.197 --> 03:16:16.443
(gasping and laughing) How fucking crazy is that?

03:16:16.443 --> 03:16:17.743
Oh my god.

03:16:17.743 --> 03:16:21.772
MATT: He gives it a smile and a nod, eyes unblinking.

03:16:21.772 --> 03:16:25.616
LAURA: Oh, a massive creature shatters a city.

03:16:26.453 --> 03:16:29.683
Shut up, that's so fucking perfect. What?

03:16:29.683 --> 03:16:32.053
Okay. Flip the next card. Roll a d20.

03:16:33.570 --> 03:16:35.426
TALIESIN: It's the image of the Calamity.

03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:38.962
MATT: One.

03:16:38.962 --> 03:16:40.650
LAURA: (whispering) One?
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:16:40.650 --> 03:16:41.967
LAURA: This card.

03:16:41.967 --> 03:16:43.656
Ooh, this is your present.

03:16:46.023 --> 03:16:47.116
The Tyrant.

03:16:49.743 --> 03:16:54.663
Ooh, two dragons fight each other in a figure eight.

03:16:54.663 --> 03:16:58.521
The one facing you is red.

03:16:59.433 --> 03:17:01.441
MATT: "Hmm."
LAURA: Flip your last card.

03:17:01.441 --> 03:17:03.095
This is your future.

03:17:05.873 --> 03:17:06.706
MATT: 18.

03:17:10.848 --> 03:17:13.946
LAURA: (exhaling) Wow.

03:17:13.946 --> 03:17:15.781
This card is so important.

03:17:15.781 --> 03:17:17.883
TALIESIN: (snickering) I am so impressed.

03:17:17.883 --> 03:17:19.564
MARISHA: Yeah, you're good at this.

03:17:19.564 --> 03:17:21.873
LAURA: This is the card--

03:17:23.934 --> 03:17:26.493
I want you to roll a d6.

03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:30.113
MATT: One.

03:17:31.680 --> 03:17:34.813
LAURA: Facing you is Death.

03:17:34.813 --> 03:17:37.133
That's not necessarily a bad thing, Lucien, you know.

03:17:37.133 --> 03:17:39.826
Some people think that Death means a rebirth.

03:17:42.356 --> 03:17:44.730
Something must end for something new to begin.

03:17:46.441 --> 03:17:49.941
MATT: His right hand twitches, like twice.

03:17:54.108 --> 03:17:55.608
LAURA: How do you feel?

03:17:59.098 --> 03:18:00.676
MATT: "Thank you. That was interesting.

03:18:01.763 --> 03:18:02.696
"Always been...

03:18:03.553 --> 03:18:06.323
"oddly curious from a distance about such strange...

03:18:09.093 --> 03:18:10.613
"hobbies.

03:18:10.613 --> 03:18:12.000
"Thank you for indulging in the offer."

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:12.833
LAURA: Of course.

03:18:12.833 --> 03:18:14.943
I gather up the cards.

03:18:14.943 --> 03:18:19.680
MATT: He stands up and walks uncomfortably

03:18:19.680 --> 03:18:23.317
towards the rest of the Tomb Takers.

03:18:24.450 --> 03:18:25.429
SAM: (exhaling delightedly)

03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:27.041
TALIESIN: Can't blame the cards, you made 'em, motherfucker!

03:18:27.041 --> 03:18:27.874
Okay, no--

03:18:27.874 --> 03:18:29.450
(laughter)

03:18:29.450 --> 03:18:34.273
LAURA: Ooh hoo! How fucking crazy were those pulls though?

03:18:34.273 --> 03:18:36.003
MATT: As you sit there, looking at the cards,

03:18:36.003 --> 03:18:37.536
and see him sit down,

03:18:39.032 --> 03:18:40.799
facing away from everybody.

03:18:44.013 --> 03:18:45.570
You can pick them up and begin to walk back

03:18:45.570 --> 03:18:47.876
to the rest of the group as they're setting up their camp.

03:18:50.503 --> 03:18:52.383
We're going to go ahead and end tonight's episode.

03:18:52.383 --> 03:18:54.412
(groaning)

03:18:54.412 --> 03:18:56.397
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud.

03:18:56.397 --> 03:18:58.492
ASHLEY: That was-- you're good at that.
MARISHA: That was amazing!

03:18:58.492 --> 03:18:59.392
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was amazing!

03:18:59.392 --> 03:19:00.733
MATT: That was awesome. (chuckling)

03:19:00.733 --> 03:19:02.060
TALIESIN: In my head, I'm like, what did she-- Oh, shit.

03:19:02.060 --> 03:19:03.763
ASHLEY: (groaning)

03:19:03.763 --> 03:19:04.633
TRAVIS: Did you make that shit up?

03:19:04.633 --> 03:19:05.683
I thought you did it by the cards?

03:19:05.683 --> 03:19:06.516
LAURA: I did by the cards.

03:19:06.516 --> 03:19:09.963
I did it by the numbers that we listed.
TALIESIN: We have a random pull system.

03:19:09.963 --> 03:19:12.033
MARISHA: Yeah. It's tarot.

03:19:12.033 --> 03:19:13.476
Anything's justified.

03:19:14.613 --> 03:19:15.446
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: That's cool.

03:19:15.446 --> 03:19:16.657
(laughter)

03:19:16.657 --> 03:19:18.083
TRAVIS: Really cool.

03:19:18.083 --> 03:19:19.980
The double hand twitch.
LAURA: That was fucking sick.

03:19:19.980 --> 03:19:21.722
MATT: Okay. Okay.
MARISHA: That's rad.

03:19:21.722 --> 03:19:23.682
TALIESIN: The Calamity-- a fucking Calamity card.
MARISHA: I know! I want to know what happens!

03:19:23.682 --> 03:19:25.202
ASHLEY: I don't want to stop!

03:19:25.202 --> 03:19:26.035
MATT: (laughs)

03:19:26.948 --> 03:19:28.583
MATT: I'm living for that.

03:19:28.583 --> 03:19:33.072
I'm living for this, like, weird power dynamic.

03:19:33.072 --> 03:19:34.453
TRAVIS: It's a written show, you guys.

03:19:34.453 --> 03:19:35.715
Our writers are amazing.

03:19:35.715 --> 03:19:36.705
(laughter)

03:19:36.705 --> 03:19:38.526
I mean, they're really on point.

03:19:38.526 --> 03:19:40.794
COVID has forced them into, like, really good shape.

03:19:40.794 --> 03:19:42.903
(laughter)

03:19:42.903 --> 03:19:46.803
MARISHA: Extreme circumstances.
MATT: Yeah. Oh man.

03:19:46.803 --> 03:19:48.957
TALIESIN: History of the world before the world.

03:19:48.957 --> 03:19:49.924
MATT: Yeah.

03:19:49.924 --> 03:19:51.995
TALIESIN: Dream the world to come.
LAURA: This was fun.

03:19:51.995 --> 03:19:53.145
TALIESIN: Fuck.
SAM: Man.

03:19:53.145 --> 03:19:55.615
MATT: And we'll pick up from there next week.

03:19:55.615 --> 03:19:58.273
LIAM: Man, I hope he takes us up on. I hope--

03:19:58.273 --> 03:19:59.106
Let me ask a question?

03:19:59.106 --> 03:19:59.939
MATT: Yes.

03:19:59.939 --> 03:20:04.101
LIAM: I know what Molly's deal was. Is Lucien they or he?

03:20:04.101 --> 03:20:06.532
MATT: Lucien is he.
LIAM: He.

03:20:06.532 --> 03:20:07.563
I wonder if he's going to take us--

03:20:07.563 --> 03:20:09.103
I hope he takes us up on his offer.

03:20:09.103 --> 03:20:11.163
'Cause that seems awkward and interesting.

03:20:11.163 --> 03:20:13.283
MATT: That was a very high roll.

03:20:13.283 --> 03:20:16.453
And we'll see how the next day plays out.

03:20:16.453 --> 03:20:17.286
MARISHA: To have dinner--

03:20:17.286 --> 03:20:20.949
MATT: You guys are playing a very unique game of--

03:20:20.949 --> 03:20:25.100
Like you said, of prisoner,

03:20:25.100 --> 03:20:27.143
challenge,

03:20:27.143 --> 03:20:28.893
push and pull,

03:20:28.893 --> 03:20:30.613
shifting roles,

03:20:30.613 --> 03:20:32.323
mutual intimidation.

03:20:32.323 --> 03:20:34.863
And it's like riding a line back and forth.

03:20:34.863 --> 03:20:37.426
It's fucking fascinating.

03:20:37.426 --> 03:20:39.208
Oh, there's moments in this where I'm just like,

03:20:39.208 --> 03:20:43.493
(exhales sharply) "Okay, this would be-- okay."

03:20:43.493 --> 03:20:45.213
Keep me on my toes. I love it.

03:20:45.213 --> 03:20:46.363
But we'll pick up there next week.

03:20:46.363 --> 03:20:47.643
Thank you all for joining us.

03:20:47.643 --> 03:20:48.476
TRAVIS: Happy 2021.

03:20:48.476 --> 03:20:49.898
MATT: Happy 2021.

03:20:49.898 --> 03:20:51.203
(cheering)

03:20:51.203 --> 03:20:54.527
MATT: Hopefully much happier 2021.

03:20:54.527 --> 03:20:57.577
We love you all very much. And is it Thursday yet?

03:20:57.577 --> 03:20:58.410
Good night.

03:20:58.410 --> 03:20:59.410
(cheering)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.441
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.524
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.524 --> 00:00:08.387
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:13.603
MATT: Nice try. Before we jump into tonight's
game, we have some quick announcements to get

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:18.267
through. First and foremost, we have our fantastic
returning sponsor, for the second year now with

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.476
this campaign, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:22.230
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:29.194
SAM: Hi! (clears throat) Little tickle in my
throat, sorry. Hi guys! As you all know, I am a

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:33.077
bit of an amateur inventor. This is no news
to you guys.

00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:34.615
TRAVIS: That's total news.

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:42.481
SAM: Some of my most notable inventions have been
the pet hot air balloon, the smell-over-Skype

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:49.103
plugin, and of course the Nintendo Virtual Boy.
But this new one I invented for our friends at D&amp;D

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:53.215
Beyond. It's an invention that I made--

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:55.880
LAURA: Oh god.

00:00:55.881 --> 00:01:04.397
SAM: I call it the D&amp;D Beyond Merciri. It's all
the organizational power of D&amp;D Beyond in a

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:10.894
tricked-out smart speaker, with a helpful voice
that some of you might recognize. I'll demonstrate

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:18.623
it for you right now, guys, okay? Merciri, what's
the best way to organize your D&amp;D characters and campaigns?

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:21.813
MATT: (VO as Merciri) "That's simple. It's D&amp;D
Beyond."

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:29.985
SAM: Hey, see, it works! Merciri, tell me about
the halfling race.

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:34.557
MATT: "Standing three feet tall, halflings are
adept at hiding, avoiding conflict, and have

00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:40.052
remarkable luck. They are a typically happy race,
sort of the opposite of goblins. Ew, goblins.

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:42.431
Goblins are super gross. Seriously."

00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:51.988
SAM: Okay, Merciri, cancel. Merciri, who's the
best player on Critical Role?

00:01:51.988 --> 00:01:55.745
MATT: "Accessing data. The answer is Travis
Willingham."

00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:58.414
TRAVIS: (triumphant yelling)

00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:05.210
SAM: Okay. That's fine. Merciri, who's the&lt;i&gt;
smartest&lt;/i&gt; player on Critical Role?

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.802
MATT: "Taliesin Jaffe. He has 4000 years of
knowledge."

00:02:08.802 --> 00:02:15.045
SAM: That's true, that is true. Okay, fine.
Merciri, who are the top three cast members on

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:17.499
Critical Role by popularity?

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:22.571
MATT: "Number one, Travis Willingham. Number two,
a tie between Marisha Ray, Laura Bailey, Ashley

00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:28.237
Johnson, Liam O'Brien, Taliesin Jaffe, and Matthew
Mercer. Number three, Maxwell James."

00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:32.386
(laughter)

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:41.100
SAM: Okay, he's not in the cast. There's some
bugs. Fine, Merciri, could you please list the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.877
most handsome &lt;i&gt;male&lt;/i&gt; cast members, with a beard,
who are not Taliesin, Liam, or Sam?

00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:50.415
MATT: "Wil Wheaton, Khary Payton--"

00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:57.304
SAM: Fuck you. Wait, can you do that list one more
time, Merciri?

00:02:57.305 --> 00:03:00.761
MATT: "Wil Wheaton, Khary Payton, Will Friedle,
Marisha Ray."

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:04.405
SAM: Yeah, so she doesn't even have a beard,
Merciri.

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:08.092
MATT: "It doesn't matter. She's an amazing,
talented woman and she should be on every list."

00:03:08.093 --> 00:03:13.342
SAM: That's true. Okay. Merciri, roll a d20 for
me.

00:03:13.342 --> 00:03:14.632
MATT: "You rolled a one."

00:03:14.632 --> 00:03:16.233
LAURA: Aww.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:18.167
SAM: Merciri, roll another d20 for me.

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:19.521
MATT: "You rolled a one."

00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:21.338
SAM: Fuck you.

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:24.596
MARISHA: Merciri, roll a d20.

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:26.146
MATT: "You rolled a natural 20."

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:28.288
SAM: Oh my fucking god!

00:03:28.288 --> 00:03:30.365
TRAVIS: Burn it down!

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:36.812
SAM: Well, I guess it's back to the drawing board,
guys. Let's wrap this up: Merciri, could you tell

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:40.489
the people where they can find D&amp;D Beyond?

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.543
MATT: "Just visit dndbeyond.com, or, if you don't
have a computer, just tweet your D&amp;D-related

00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:50.501
question directly to Matthew Mercer's Twitter
account. He promises to respond to you

00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:51.938
within three hours."

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:56.847
SAM: Okay, thank you. Thank you, guys. Look for
this in stores soon.

00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:58.910
LAURA: Fabulous.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.413
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:02.187
SAM: And thank you, Merciri.

00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:04.905
LAURA: That sounded just like Matt! That is so
weird.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:08.330
SAM: It did! I'm a good inventor!

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.921
MARISHA: Is this because of the Facetime error?

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:13.429
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:15.755
LIAM: Splice it all together.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:20.528
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, our friends
at D&amp;D Beyond. We kicked off our second season of

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:27.108
Between the Sheets this past week with our
fantastic friend Logic, Bobby. It was a great

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:33.528
interview. You can check out the VOD at
youtube.com/criticalrole, and we'll be chatting

00:04:33.528 --> 00:04:40.124
next monday with Quyen Tran, which is our
wonderful Sam Riegel's wife. The amazing,

00:04:40.124 --> 00:04:46.764
accomplished director of photography for all of
television and film, and a genuine badass. You'll

00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:50.930
watch it and be like, "Sam?" And you know what?
He'll agree.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.740
(laughter)

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.050
TRAVIS: True.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.064
MATT: But yeah, so check it out. It's 7:00pm
Pacific Time at twitch.tv/criticalrole.

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:06.394
SAM: I'll be in the chat saying, "I know, right?"
The whole time.

00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:09.607
MATT: Laura, you have some merch updates, I
believe.

00:05:09.607 --> 00:05:16.767
LAURA: Oh, do I! You guys may have noticed, right
here, on one Sam Riegel, the beautiful Whispered

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:18.622
One-- ooh, look at those pecs!

00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:20.686
SAM: I'll do the Travis thing, ready?

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:23.497
LAURA: I think the shirt enhances them.

00:05:23.497 --> 00:05:26.497
LIAM: The nose hole is right in his sternum!

00:05:26.497 --> 00:05:31.043
LAURA: Ooh, beep-beep-beep. This is designed by
Lauryn Ipsum, who also designed the cover on the

00:05:31.043 --> 00:05:36.523
artbook, if you might have noticed. That's in the
store right now. I mean, is it in the store right

00:05:36.524 --> 00:05:41.815
now? Hold on, it might just be preorder. It's in
the store right now! You guys, in the UK, it's

00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:47.526
going to the UK on February 21st, I think, or the
end of February, something like that. Speaking of

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:54.246
February 21st, the other thing I need to tell you
about is our art prints that are on pre-order

00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:56.571
right now. Can we bring out Vox Machina?

00:05:56.571 --> 00:05:57.991
SAM: No, we have them here?

00:05:57.991 --> 00:05:59.456
MARISHA: Bring them out!

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:00.915
LAURA: This is our beautiful--

00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:01.800
SAM: Whoa!

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.168
LAURA: I know!

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:05.038
SAM: It's bigger than everyone.

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:13.133
LAURA: These were designed by Matteo Scalera and
Moreno Dinisio, and they're phenomenal.

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:14.380
SAM: Is there another one?

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.039
LAURA: Yeah, well, there's also--

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.087
SAM: Oh shit!

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:18.462
LAURA: Wait for it.

00:06:18.462 --> 00:06:24.385
TRAVIS: Be careful with it, don't rush it! Don't
rush it, it's too nice!

00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:26.733
LAURA: No, but this one is super unique.

00:06:26.733 --> 00:06:29.839
SAM: We're taking this one to Kinko's later
to make copies.

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:36.952
LAURA: Yeah. (gasps) The Mighty Nein! You can
order these for pre-order in these kind, and also

00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:43.456
signed versions are available as well. Those are
being on pre-order until February 21st at

00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:48.776
midnight, 11:59pm Pacific Time, that's our time.

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:51.754
LIAM: Matteo is a mad genius.

00:06:51.754 --> 00:06:53.651
SAM: He's really good.

00:06:53.651 --> 00:07:00.672
LAURA: I mean, they're gorgeous. These are on
really nice art paper. You guys may remember our

00:07:00.673 --> 00:07:06.461
David Mack art prints that we did. It's similar
paper. It's actually even nicer paper than it was before.

00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:08.776
MARISHA: Yeah, it's not slicky poster paper;
it's--

00:07:08.776 --> 00:07:16.579
LAURA: Badass. Yeah. I love you, and that's what's
available in the store. As well as other things,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.467
you know.

00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:20.103
TRAVIS: Can we get copies of that after the show?

00:07:20.103 --> 00:07:25.682
LAURA: Maybe. Oh, and, you know, you can go to our
US shop at shop.critrole.com, and our UK shop,

00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:32.222
shop.critrole.co.uk. Dot...nothing else, that's
it.

00:07:32.222 --> 00:07:38.963
MATT: Thank you, Laura. Final announcements
tonight. This is an important final announcement:

00:07:38.963 --> 00:07:43.345
we're actually taking a week off from Critical
Role next Thursday, February 7th, and Talks

00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:49.672
Machina will also go dark that Tuesday, February
12th. We'll be back on Thursday, February 14th at

00:07:49.672 --> 00:07:56.744
7:00pm Pacific with Critical Role, so we'll see
you guys then. I believe that's it and all, as far

00:07:56.744 --> 00:07:59.717
as the announcements are concerned.

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:01.588
TRAVIS: No! Not ready!

00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:07.812
MATT: That being the case, it's time to jump in to
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:08:09.758 --> 00:08:12.419
[water bubbling]

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:16.517
[thunder]

00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:19.571
[explosion]

00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:23.795
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:31.668
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:08:31.668 --> 00:08:40.975
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:48.690
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:52.931
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:08:57.172 --> 00:09:02.375
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:10.111
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:13.715
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:09:13.715 --> 00:09:20.621
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:09:22.465 --> 00:09:27.336
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:37.297
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:09:37.297 --> 00:09:45.837
[fire burning]

00:09:45.837 --> 00:09:47.463
MATT: And welcome back.

00:09:47.464 --> 00:09:50.214
(laughter)

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:56.941
SAM: I love it when you abandon it halfway through
the word.

00:09:56.941 --> 00:10:03.864
TRAVIS: The laziest bail! Wow.

00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:06.847
MATT: I salute you, Laura Bailey.

00:10:07.887 --> 00:10:11.418
MARISHA: Not even ten seconds.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.369
TRAVIS: Crash and burn.

00:10:15.729 --> 00:10:24.597
MATT: So, last we left off, the Mighty Nein had found
their way back from the Menagerie Coast to check

00:10:24.719 --> 00:10:31.458
in with some friends and the general chaos
brewing, based on the conflict between the empire

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:40.054
and the Kryn Dynasty. Upon traveling, making your
way towards the city of Felderwin, a city involved

00:10:40.054 --> 00:10:48.356
with Nott's history, you discovered that this
apothecary that had burned to the ground belonged

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:55.639
to a male halfling, who has now gone missing, and
discovered that Nott had a little boy.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:11:00.916
After learning about Nott's history, learned more
than that. You learned that Nott at one point was

00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:12.749
indeed a halfling. Through a vengeful plot by the
goblins that stalk the southeastern regions of the

00:11:12.749 --> 00:11:18.161
empire's Marrow Valley, she managed to help her
family escape, but was drowned and then

00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:23.723
reincarnated by some sort of a hooded power figure
that had an alliance with these goblins, it

00:11:23.723 --> 00:11:29.468
seemed. Brought back as a goblin and has been
living as such for the better part of two years now.

00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:38.319
Upon asking around the city and getting some
information, you discovered that the husband of

00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:46.563
Nott, or Veth, if you will, has been apparently
taken by the Kryn, and had some involvement with

00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:53.494
his alchemical studies with the Cerberus Assembly
and this study of dunamis. You acquired a few

00:11:53.494 --> 00:11:58.565
objects from a subterranean basement laboratory
that was mostly trashed, apparently in the razing

00:11:58.565 --> 00:12:00.517
of the city.

00:12:00.517 --> 00:12:06.719
You then decided to go and inspect the tunnels
where these Kryn emerged from. One of them

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:14.526
apparently was still somewhat intact. Deciding to
not be balked by a sheer wall of stone and rock,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:22.328
Jester proceeded to twice Polymorph herself into a
dire honey badger and burrow her way through

00:12:22.328 --> 00:12:30.629
hundreds and hundreds of feet of rock, emerging on
the rest of this uncollapsed burrowed tunnel of a

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:35.966
large worm creature they had used to attack,
without warning, the city of Felderwin.

00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:42.529
As you, the Mighty Nein, had made your way beyond
that boundary and began to step into this

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:49.711
subterranean cavern system, stalking and seeking
the path that these individuals took here, beneath

00:12:49.711 --> 00:12:58.917
the surface, we begin tonight's game. First off,
how would you like to prepare? What is your

00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:06.097
marching order? Let me know what your plan is now,
going in to the sheer, dark underground beneath

00:13:06.097 --> 00:13:07.033
the Marrow Valley.

00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:11.126
TRAVIS: I love it when you can hear the DM's
frustration in the retelling of the story.

00:13:11.126 --> 00:13:13.606
LAURA: Going, like, you guys are being really
stupid.

00:13:13.607 --> 00:13:14.666
MATT: Not frustration.

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:15.552
TRAVIS: No!

00:13:15.552 --> 00:13:20.303
TALIESIN: I would like to know which one of you is
hitting the rotating knives first, is what he is--

00:13:20.393 --> 00:13:21.898
MATT: They're not knives.

00:13:21.898 --> 00:13:25.859
LAURA: Maybe it's not the smartest idea for us to
do this, is all.

00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:29.427
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe we should just leave. What do
you think? Pack up and go.

00:13:29.997 --> 00:13:31.749
SAM: But my husband.

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:32.836
TRAVIS: Mm.

00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:38.079
SAM: We spent three months searching for your backstory.

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:42.143
(laughter)

00:13:42.143 --> 00:13:44.053
TRAVIS: I'm good. Y'know.

00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:52.623
It was only a joke, Nott, sorry.
Terrible timing. We should push on.

00:13:52.623 --> 00:14:03.290
SAM: I hear in Xhorhas, they have a captain there
who has lots of eyeballs that you can ingest into

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.619
your body.

00:14:04.619 --> 00:14:05.418
TRAVIS: Really?

00:14:05.418 --> 00:14:06.216
SAM: Yes.

00:14:06.216 --> 00:14:07.413
TRAVIS: Lots of eyeballs?

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:10.221
SAM: Lots of golden eyeballs that you can put in
your belly.

00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:13.828
TRAVIS: Sounds like a magic place. This fucker.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.956
TALIESIN: I just figured that out, okay. Not even
kidding.

00:14:20.366 --> 00:14:23.053
SAM: All right, what are we preparing?

00:14:24.286 --> 00:14:29.407
MATT: Well, first off, a marching order. These
tunnels here can range between brief bits of

00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:37.076
cavern and open chambers to following this carved
worm tunnel, which is about ten feet wide and is

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:41.456
cylindrical. You can have at most two people
shoulder-to-shoulder going through each place. I

00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:45.830
would like to know, for the majority of this
journey-- and tell me when you want to change it

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.824
up at any point-- I want to know what your
marching order is, traveling through here.

00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:53.112
TRAVIS: Who has the best darkvision, I would
imagine. We should have--

00:14:53.112 --> 00:14:55.204
MARISHA: I have put on my goggles, for sure.

00:14:55.204 --> 00:14:56.063
TRAVIS: I have 60.

00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:57.256
LAURA: I have 60 as well.

00:14:57.257 --> 00:14:59.214
SAM: Me too, but I'm not very perceptive.

00:14:59.214 --> 00:15:01.452
LAURA: I am decently perceptive; how about you?

00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:04.213
TALIESIN: I'm very perceptive, but I can't see in
the dark.

00:15:04.214 --> 00:15:05.736
LAURA: Oh, no! Really, Caduceus?

00:15:05.736 --> 00:15:08.302
TRAVIS: The two clerics do not go
shoulder-to-shoulder.

00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:11.251
TALIESIN: No, we should probably keep a little bit
of distance.

00:15:11.251 --> 00:15:13.582
LAURA: I'll stay next to you, Fjord, in the
front.

00:15:13.593 --> 00:15:18.244
MARISHA: Can octopuses see in the dark? If you do
the facemask thing?

00:15:18.244 --> 00:15:26.612
LIAM: That's not happening here. He is a cat. No,
but I have this rag over one of my-- it's dim, but

00:15:26.612 --> 00:15:29.101
maybe you and I can stand near the middle.

00:15:29.101 --> 00:15:31.051
TALIESIN: I'll stick with you. All right.

00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:33.654
MATT: We have Caleb and Caduceus towards the
center.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.327
MARISHA: I guess I'll go up front.

00:15:36.327 --> 00:15:41.178
TRAVIS: Well, you got shitty darkvision. Oh, but
you got the goggles. And who are you with? Nott?

00:15:41.178 --> 00:15:43.198
MARISHA: No one's called a partner yet.

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:45.601
SAM: I'll go with you.

00:15:45.601 --> 00:15:48.658
TALIESIN: Also we should probably have Yasha up
front as well.

00:15:48.658 --> 00:15:49.989
LAURA: Good call.

00:15:49.989 --> 00:15:53.348
TRAVIS: Darkvision for Yasha--

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:55.338
TALIESIN: Probably not.

00:15:55.338 --> 00:15:56.577
MATT: Go look.

00:15:56.577 --> 00:15:57.558
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

00:15:57.558 --> 00:16:04.654
MATT: There you go. Yasha and Beau at the front.
Behind that, Caleb and Caduceus. Who's behind them?

00:16:04.654 --> 00:16:08.480
LAURA: I think it was going to be me and Fjord at
the front. Are you perceptive?

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.741
TRAVIS: Decent.

00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:16.042
MATT: So Fjord and Jester at the front. Then,
Nott, you're taking the back?

00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:19.289
SAM: I'm with Marisha-- I mean Beau. Wherever
she is.

00:16:19.289 --> 00:16:20.621
MATT: So then where's Yasha?

00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:22.178
LAURA: Yasha can be at the back.

00:16:22.178 --> 00:16:23.990
SAM: Yasha's in the back. Sorry, Matt.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.893
MATT: Don't apologize. It's okay, we're figuring
this out.

00:16:26.893 --> 00:16:30.159
LAURA: Will Nugget fit by Yasha?

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:33.250
MATT: Okay, yeah, if you would like to have taken
your--

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.931
LAURA: Where else will I put him, you know?

00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:40.282
TRAVIS: I don't know, maybe outside of the tunnel?
Back at the place where we were?

00:16:40.282 --> 00:16:41.880
LAURA: Where would they stay?

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.450
MATT: I don't have the mini on me at the moment.
I can do that at the break. However, as you've

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:58.290
worked out your grouping, traveling through these
tunnels, you go on for an hour, two hours.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.881
Those at the front, which would be you two, I'd
like you both to make a perception check, please.

00:17:02.881 --> 00:17:04.621
TRAVIS: I will give you advantage.

00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:05.723
MATT: So you're helping.

00:17:05.723 --> 00:17:06.840
TRAVIS: Helping, yeah.

00:17:06.841 --> 00:17:08.763
LAURA: Okey dokey.

00:17:14.087 --> 00:17:16.606
That would be 19.

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:25.575
MATT: Keeping a watch as you guys progress, the
faint perpetual decline goes deeper and deeper

00:17:25.575 --> 00:17:30.936
beneath the earth. The rushing sounds of the
underground river that seems to be walking

00:17:30.936 --> 00:17:37.506
alongside this passageway slowly fades as you see
the river now pass beneath stone, the cavern come

00:17:37.507 --> 00:17:43.184
to an end, and the entrance of the next portion of
the tunnel where the worm creature had to burrow

00:17:43.184 --> 00:17:52.163
into this chamber. There are natural pockets of
cavernous areas here, but a lot of them aren't

00:17:52.163 --> 00:17:58.126
connected except for by this particular burrowed
tunnel. So that's probably going to be the path

00:17:58.126 --> 00:18:01.675
you're going to be looking for
wherever you're traveling.

00:18:01.675 --> 00:18:11.276
LAURA: Okay. I have a question, you guys. I've got
this super-secret dodecahedron thingy in my bag

00:18:11.276 --> 00:18:16.901
that Yussa specifically said that we should not be
bringing near anything and stuff, and now we're

00:18:16.901 --> 00:18:19.877
taking it right to the source. Do you think
that's a bad idea?

00:18:19.877 --> 00:18:24.085
TRAVIS: Well, as a bit of clarification, I think
we weren't supposed to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; it, right?

00:18:24.085 --> 00:18:28.425
Anything that would activate it and send off
energy. I think as long as it's in the other

00:18:28.425 --> 00:18:31.928
dimension that is her bag, it's okay, right?

00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:36.855
LAURA: Right, unless they capture me and flip my
bag inside out, and then they have it, yeah.

00:18:36.855 --> 00:18:41.825
TALIESIN: It would still be in a big metal case
until they really went through.

00:18:41.825 --> 00:18:47.346
LIAM: Yeah, but we need to weigh the risks
we are facing, and Nott's husband.

00:18:47.346 --> 00:18:50.119
SAM: Where would we put it otherwise?

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.325
LAURA: I don't know.

00:18:51.485 --> 00:18:56.246
LIAM: There are also people behind us
topside who'd kill us for this, as well.

00:18:56.716 --> 00:19:00.101
SAM: Where's the tripod and stuff right now?

00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:03.283
LAURA: It's in my bag as well. I've got
the whole setup going.

00:19:03.283 --> 00:19:08.190
TRAVIS: You've got the gun and the clip.
The only way they're going to grab it and

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.024
turn it out is if most of us are dead, right?

00:19:12.024 --> 00:19:17.103
LAURA: Right, and we're only fighting
an entire army of soldiers, so it probably

00:19:17.103 --> 00:19:19.370
won't happen that we will die.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.638
SAM: We don't know that. It might be
very nice there.

00:19:22.638 --> 00:19:26.377
LAURA: That's true. Yasha, you think
it'll be nice?

00:19:26.377 --> 00:19:35.485
MATT: Yasha stares ahead for a moment and goes,
"Having been to places like the coast,

00:19:35.486 --> 00:19:38.091
"it's not very nice."

00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:45.667
SAM: Let's just make sure you don't get captured
and your bag doesn't get grabbed.

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:47.868
TALIESIN: No harm in focusing on the positive.

00:19:47.868 --> 00:19:48.967
TRAVIS: That's right.

00:19:48.968 --> 00:19:51.267
TALIESIN: Nothing we can do about it.

00:19:51.267 --> 00:19:54.416
MARISHA: So we're going to come to a
conclusion later, maybe?

00:19:54.416 --> 00:19:57.033
SAM: We're just looking on the bright side
of things.

00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.202
TALIESIN: We can't make a plan until we
know what we're up against.

00:20:00.202 --> 00:20:02.372
LAURA: That's true.

00:20:02.372 --> 00:20:06.634
LIAM: If we are lucky, we will overtake
them before we return to their home.

00:20:06.634 --> 00:20:10.289
TALIESIN: And if they're too much, then we'll
just get what information we can, maybe

00:20:10.289 --> 00:20:17.374
sneak in while they're sleeping, and scurry out
with what we need with no harm, no problem.

00:20:17.374 --> 00:20:20.888
MARISHA: I have no idea what we're talking about.

00:20:21.993 --> 00:20:23.604
TRAVIS: Let's push forward.

00:20:23.604 --> 00:20:27.852
LAURA: What's in this pocket o' cavern? Anything
cool?

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:33.026
MATT: Rolling your perception, you don't see
anything aside from the natural formations.

00:20:33.026 --> 00:20:38.508
There's the smell of hard water and wet earth that
permeates the entirety of this chamber, and

00:20:38.508 --> 00:20:47.828
continuing on for quite some time. The natural
chambers and pathways here are chained together by

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:52.846
these tunnels, but within them, it doesn't look,
from anything you've seen so far is lived in. You

00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:59.368
don't see signs of any other creatures making
homes or nests. You do see bits of quartz-like

00:20:59.368 --> 00:21:03.426
crystal forming from gathered minerals over time.

00:21:04.356 --> 00:21:06.035
TALIESIN: I really like it.

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:07.629
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty.

00:21:07.839 --> 00:21:14.926
MATT: A series of stalactites and stalagmites that
find their way through the-- see? Thank you guys,

00:21:14.927 --> 00:21:16.127
for your help.

00:21:16.127 --> 00:21:17.359
LAURA: T. Top.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:24.997
MATT: Yes. Just keep giving me suggestions. Really
figured it out. It's not condescending at all.

00:21:27.921 --> 00:21:31.235
LAURA: Are there footprints on the ground?

00:21:31.235 --> 00:21:33.105
MATT: Make a survival check.

00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:34.918
TALIESIN: We did find some earlier.

00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:36.517
MATT: Yeah, the previous tunnel.

00:21:38.777 --> 00:21:39.955
LAURA: 15?

00:21:39.955 --> 00:21:48.005
MATT: Yeah, based on looking at the ground here,
which is mostly packed dirt and general loose

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:52.630
pieces of pebbles, and things that were pushed and
ground around by the creature that made its way

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:58.847
through the area. In its wake you can see familiar
footfalls, similar to the shape that you'd

00:21:58.847 --> 00:22:03.220
previously seen that didn't match the rest of the
crownsguard and/or the Righteous Brand that

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:09.832
existed in the vicinity of Felderwin. You do
notice the trail, the tracks, of the Kryn warriors

00:22:09.832 --> 00:22:15.516
that had exited, and it does lead and follow the
burrowing path of the worm.

00:22:16.021 --> 00:22:22.493
LAURA: How big of a trail is the worm thing? Is it
like this? Is it like this?

00:22:22.494 --> 00:22:25.316
MATT: It's about ten feet wide. Eight to ten feet
wide.

00:22:25.316 --> 00:22:35.838
LAURA: Cool! So we're fighting these guys and a
giant worm creature that is ten feet in width, so

00:22:35.838 --> 00:22:39.200
he's probably kind of long.

00:22:39.736 --> 00:22:43.970
TRAVIS: Probably. And we've got lots of room to
maneuver in these caverns.

00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.695
SAM: Are you scared?

00:22:47.695 --> 00:22:52.492
LAURA: I mean, I'm not going to lie, Nott. I am a
little bit nervous.

00:22:52.492 --> 00:22:59.282
MARISHA: I think I would be a little more
confident if we had a vague idea of a plan? Don't

00:22:59.282 --> 00:23:08.737
get me wrong, super down to fly by the seat of my
pants. That type of girl. But sneaking in, killing

00:23:08.738 --> 00:23:15.518
people in the middle of the night, two armies,
fight, getting captured-- these all sound like

00:23:15.518 --> 00:23:19.015
real big stories.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.780
LIAM: I have a question for you, Jester. You know
how you have just turned yourself into the

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.506
oversized honey badger?

00:23:25.506 --> 00:23:26.587
LAURA: Yeah.

00:23:26.587 --> 00:23:31.557
LIAM: Could you do that to a giant worm, but, say,
turn it into a cow?

00:23:31.557 --> 00:23:36.796
LAURA: Well, yeah, remember what I did to-- Oh you
weren't-- Remember when I turned that dragon into

00:23:36.796 --> 00:23:41.661
that little thing? That's what I could do to a
worm, I guess. I did that to the dragon before you

00:23:41.661 --> 00:23:44.407
came in, you know, when we almost died.

00:23:44.407 --> 00:23:54.324
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;. Rather than trying to whack away at a
gigantic worm, maybe you just make it harmless,

00:23:54.325 --> 00:23:57.661
but not so little that it loses its new form.

00:23:57.661 --> 00:23:58.705
LAURA: Good call.

00:23:58.705 --> 00:24:00.283
TALIESIN: Like a goat, maybe.

00:24:00.284 --> 00:24:01.500
LIAM: Yeah, a goat.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:08.875
LAURA: Yeah. Or something maybe like a sparrow or
something, so it will fly away.

00:24:08.875 --> 00:24:13.030
MARISHA: I like that better. Goats are weird.
Square pupils.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.526
SAM: Or a firefly. We could catch it in a jar.

00:24:15.526 --> 00:24:21.898
LIAM: I think something small is likely to get
smacked and taken out of its newer form. It would

00:24:21.898 --> 00:24:25.162
need to be something that could take a bit of
punishment.

00:24:25.162 --> 00:24:28.063
LAURA: Like a dire honey badger.

00:24:28.063 --> 00:24:32.234
LIAM: Like that. Or a cow.

00:24:32.234 --> 00:24:36.270
SAM: See? Look, Beau, we have a plan.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.676
MARISHA: Encounter worm--

00:24:37.677 --> 00:24:39.395
SAM and MARISHA: Turn into a cow.

00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:41.549
SAM: Profit.

00:24:42.188 --> 00:24:45.799
TRAVIS: You know, dire honey badgers got claws and
stuff. Maybe a dire sheep.

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:48.329
LAURA: Ooh, that's good, I like that, Fjord.

00:24:48.329 --> 00:24:49.329
TRAVIS: Yeah, anyway.

00:24:49.329 --> 00:24:51.566
MARISHA: I think they still have square pupils.

00:24:51.566 --> 00:24:54.043
TRAVIS: It'll hit you in the moment. I got a
feeling.

00:24:54.043 --> 00:24:55.348
TALIESIN: Is that true?

00:24:55.348 --> 00:24:59.903
LAURA: Also, though, I can't do that until we
sleep, but I don't think we're going to run into

00:24:59.903 --> 00:25:05.488
them today, right? Because they're probably really
far ahead of us, because they got a two week lead?

00:25:05.488 --> 00:25:06.439
TRAVIS: Totally.

00:25:06.439 --> 00:25:08.627
TALIESIN: Stop laughing, DM. That's not funny.

00:25:08.627 --> 00:25:10.363
MATT: No, roll a nature check.

00:25:10.363 --> 00:25:12.095
TRAVIS: What are you rolling for?

00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:14.337
SAM: Yeah, just roll a nature check. It's fine.

00:25:14.337 --> 00:25:15.624
LIAM: Everybody's doing it.

00:25:15.624 --> 00:25:17.671
TALIESIN: That's an eight. My nature sucks.

00:25:17.673 --> 00:25:20.106
MATT: You have no idea if sheep's pupils are
square.

00:25:20.106 --> 00:25:23.262
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you. I didn't need to roll
to know that.

00:25:23.262 --> 00:25:24.542
MATT: All right.

00:25:27.513 --> 00:25:28.730
TRAVIS: We press on.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:37.984
MATT: You push on? What little light you have
shoving back the darkness, via the dull orb that

00:25:37.984 --> 00:25:42.582
Caleb is carrying in the center of the heart of
your traveling troupe, you leave that first

00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:46.998
winding cavern and begin to continue down the
burrowed hallway created by this worm. It

00:25:46.998 --> 00:25:56.224
stretches on for a mile, two miles, five miles...

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:03.729
MARISHA: Can I keep a lookout to see if there's
any markings on the walls? Any signs of

00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:06.501
directional type of code or language?
While we're walking.

00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:08.296
MATT: Sure. Make a perception check.

00:26:08.296 --> 00:26:09.463
LAURA: Traps, too.

00:26:09.463 --> 00:26:14.081
SAM: Traps? No, they wouldn't think anyone would
be following them. They covered up the thing with

00:26:14.082 --> 00:26:16.904
200 feet of earth and rocks.

00:26:16.904 --> 00:26:19.236
MARISHA: 19.

00:26:19.236 --> 00:26:29.363
MATT: Walking along, the things you do notice is
the stone and earth seems fairly smooth, the way

00:26:29.363 --> 00:26:35.638
it's pushed through, but getting up close you can
see tiny little scrapes or hooks, where you gather

00:26:35.638 --> 00:26:39.862
is probably how the creature manages to break
through and push its way through, through

00:26:39.863 --> 00:26:47.454
expanding and contracting muscles within its long
body, and these spine or scale-like protrusions

00:26:47.454 --> 00:26:54.061
that dig in and pull it along rather quickly
underground. Beyond figuring out the locomotion of

00:26:54.062 --> 00:27:01.433
this entity, this creature, you don't, along this
part of the journey at least yet, see any signs of

00:27:01.433 --> 00:27:15.641
purposeful markings, essentially. Continuing on
for the next five to six hours, still following

00:27:15.641 --> 00:27:20.267
this tunnel, starting to get a little tired.

00:27:21.044 --> 00:27:23.757
TALIESIN: At some point we do need to rest.

00:27:23.757 --> 00:27:28.358
LAURA: I wonder if there's another big pocket o'
cavern coming up, or if we have to sleep in this

00:27:28.358 --> 00:27:29.578
little tunnel?

00:27:29.578 --> 00:27:33.413
TRAVIS: I forget what time we entered into the
tunnel. What time of day was it?

00:27:33.413 --> 00:27:37.236
MATT: If I recall, it was somewhere around midday,
a little after noon.

00:27:37.236 --> 00:27:40.929
TRAVIS: We could push on for another hour or two,
but we really should--

00:27:40.929 --> 00:27:43.740
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb, what time is it?

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.910
LIAM: Well, I will tell you.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:53.399
MATT: I'd say at this time, it's probably close to
dusk on the surface. Fucking feat.

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:56.302
TRAVIS: You fucking feat.

00:27:56.303 --> 00:27:57.457
LIAM: It's in the book.

00:27:57.457 --> 00:27:59.271
MATT: I know it's in the book!

00:27:59.289 --> 00:28:04.323
SAM: We're in the bored-out tunnel that the worm
made, right? There's no water near us, because we

00:28:04.323 --> 00:28:05.985
passed water on the way in.

00:28:05.985 --> 00:28:10.556
MATT: You passed water in the first cavern that
you went through. That lasted for maybe about a

00:28:10.596 --> 00:28:17.813
mile or so. The bulk of it weaving through where a
lot of the water passing through that river carved

00:28:17.813 --> 00:28:22.270
through the rock over time, but then eventually
that trailed off, and this burrow was the only

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:27.269
other path to take. You've been there for a number
of hours now.

00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:37.493
SAM: You know that thing where you've gone so far
that you can't really-- we can't turn around, can

00:28:37.535 --> 00:28:41.355
we? It feels like it would be a waste of a day.
We've got to keep going.

00:28:41.355 --> 00:28:42.468
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

00:28:42.468 --> 00:28:45.085
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:45.085 --> 00:28:50.903
MATT: You keep pressing on. All right. A few more
hours pass. People at the front, roll perception

00:28:50.903 --> 00:28:52.444
checks for me, please?

00:28:52.444 --> 00:28:54.220
LAURA: Again?

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.668
TRAVIS: I'll help.

00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:57.633
MARISHA: I have a question for Caduceus.

00:29:02.379 --> 00:29:03.656
LAURA: 17.

00:29:04.407 --> 00:29:08.667
MATT: Good to know. You had a question for
Caduceus, you said?

00:29:08.667 --> 00:29:12.265
MARISHA: Cad, do you have any idea how far
underground we are?

00:29:12.265 --> 00:29:13.322
TALIESIN: Nope.

00:29:13.322 --> 00:29:15.761
MARISHA: Okay. That was my question.

00:29:15.761 --> 00:29:18.811
(laughter)

00:29:19.552 --> 00:29:20.792
TRAVIS: Succinct.

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:23.128
TALIESIN: So glad it's one I can answer.

00:29:23.849 --> 00:29:32.399
MATT: You continue on for another hour or so. You
do come to another chamber, but it's only about 30

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:40.222
by 20 feet wide, and it's a heavy geode. It looks
like there are a locked piece, a pocket of old,

00:29:40.222 --> 00:29:45.646
stale air that was opened up as this worm burrowed
through. You can see broken crystals of many

00:29:45.646 --> 00:29:49.834
beautiful colors, a lot of them milky white,
quartz-like, a few that are almost a purple

00:29:49.834 --> 00:29:52.427
amethyst tint to it.

00:29:52.427 --> 00:29:55.267
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Light behind
the crystal.

00:29:55.267 --> 00:29:59.841
MATT: It's a beautiful prism. As you see, the
entire room is a scattering of shades of purple,

00:29:59.841 --> 00:30:04.738
pink, and, strangely, orange. It refracts the
light in a way you haven't seen before, and for

00:30:04.738 --> 00:30:10.165
the moment, this dark ominous space becomes this
beautiful disco.

00:30:10.165 --> 00:30:12.107
TALIESIN: I couldn't help myself.

00:30:12.107 --> 00:30:14.651
LAURA: Magical things live here, I bet.

00:30:14.651 --> 00:30:18.083
MARISHA: I've heard of faery creatures. I bet they
live--

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:23.537
TALIESIN: I'm listening very carefully to see if
anything, any noise is coming from the next room.

00:30:23.537 --> 00:30:26.188
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:30:26.502 --> 00:30:28.158
TALIESIN: With advantage-- no, just perception.

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.844
MATT: Just a perception check.

00:30:30.834 --> 00:30:33.301
TALIESIN: That is a 19.

00:30:33.301 --> 00:30:38.201
MATT: You take a moment and listen to the quiet.
No sound. No vibration.

00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:39.678
TALIESIN: Kill the light again.

00:30:39.678 --> 00:30:41.486
LAURA: Kill it? Why would you kill it?

00:30:41.486 --> 00:30:43.392
TALIESIN: We'll turn it back on, but I--

00:30:43.392 --> 00:30:44.867
LAURA: It was so beautiful!

00:30:44.867 --> 00:30:49.348
TRAVIS: We are going to rest, right? I mean, might
as well take advantage of such a nice place.

00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:52.724
LAURA: Yeah, let's sleep in here. Is the ground
covered in crystal, too?

00:30:52.725 --> 00:30:57.859
MATT: Yes, on the edges of it. However, where the
worm had burrowed through, there's a part of the

00:30:57.859 --> 00:31:02.530
ground that's digging into a divot. The interior
of the geode's been carved out in that space.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:07.177
TALIESIN: Is there any part of the wall that is
still stone and not crystal?

00:31:07.178 --> 00:31:11.997
MATT: There are small bits, maybe like two- or
three-feet pockets, but a large portion of this

00:31:11.997 --> 00:31:15.987
little geode chamber is mostly covered in crystal.

00:31:15.987 --> 00:31:19.595
LIAM: Has any of the crystal been broken away by
the worm's passage through here?

00:31:19.595 --> 00:31:22.052
MATT: Yes. Quite a bit of it has been cracked
and broken.

00:31:22.052 --> 00:31:26.004
LIAM: Does any of it look of value as a
rare stone?

00:31:26.004 --> 00:31:27.814
MATT: Make a nature check for me.

00:31:28.734 --> 00:31:30.176
SAM: You could tattoo with it.

00:31:30.176 --> 00:31:31.335
LAURA: Yeah, maybe.

00:31:31.335 --> 00:31:32.862
LIAM: 16.

00:31:32.862 --> 00:31:40.318
MATT: A lot of this appears to be natural crystal.
It's not a particular gemstone or anything really

00:31:40.318 --> 00:31:46.771
precious, per se. You're sure you could probably--
there are uses for it. Some people like to use

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:56.417
them as focuses for healing and for general decor.
Simple, cheap jewelry can be made from this as well.

00:31:56.418 --> 00:31:58.757
SAM: Vivid dreams, man!

00:31:58.757 --> 00:32:00.385
MATT: Yeah, there you go.

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:01.917
LIAM: I'm going to scoop up a handful of them.

00:32:01.918 --> 00:32:03.738
LAURA: Me too, me too! It's pretty.

00:32:03.738 --> 00:32:04.602
SAM: Me three.

00:32:04.602 --> 00:32:08.989
MATT: Okay. You're not sure what the worth is.
You haven't delved in the realm of selling or

00:32:08.989 --> 00:32:13.373
purchasing crystals in the street before, but you
imagine, depending on the person, you could

00:32:13.373 --> 00:32:16.041
probably get a little bit of coin for it.

00:32:16.326 --> 00:32:21.192
TALIESIN: I can carve out a chunk of wall if we
want to put your little dome inside.

00:32:21.192 --> 00:32:26.881
LIAM: Make it the same color as the crystals that
are here, and then I can also set an Alarm around us.

00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:30.042
MARISHA: It's see-through on the inside, right?

00:32:30.042 --> 00:32:32.861
LIAM: For us, yeah, but not from the outside.

00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:36.942
TALIESIN: Oh, so in that case, that's
pretty cool, then. I'll--

00:32:36.942 --> 00:32:40.529
LIAM: I can camouflage it to match this room.

00:32:40.529 --> 00:32:47.531
TALIESIN: Once you build it, I'll use Stone
Shape to cover it, then, so you can give it

00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:49.428
a little bit of a shell.

00:32:49.429 --> 00:32:52.071
LIAM: Yeah, so it's not such a perfect,
round surface.

00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:53.907
MATT: What are you doing?

00:32:54.075 --> 00:33:02.931
TALIESIN: Once he puts up the dome, the shack,
I'm going to use Stone Shape to cover it really

00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:07.012
quickly with a thin layer of rock
to make it look...

00:33:07.012 --> 00:33:08.014
TRAVIS: Earthen?

00:33:08.015 --> 00:33:12.350
TALIESIN: Earthen. It's not like five feet thick
of rock, but a couple inches to blanket it.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:16.822
MATT: Yeah. You couldn't cover the entire dome,
but you could definitely create a portion of it

00:33:16.822 --> 00:33:17.683
that's in a shell.

00:33:17.683 --> 00:33:19.685
TALIESIN: It's going to have a faux front.

00:33:19.685 --> 00:33:22.897
LIAM: If we leave an area where we can
pop our heads out if need be.

00:33:22.897 --> 00:33:25.185
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, it's going to be an opening.

00:33:25.185 --> 00:33:29.750
LIAM: Did you say you were going to carve a hole
to put it inside of, or should I make it against

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.900
the side of the chamber?

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.366
TALIESIN: Probably put it against so we can see
what's behind. I don't know, what do you think?

00:33:35.366 --> 00:33:37.508
TRAVIS: Backs against a wall are always safe.

00:33:37.508 --> 00:33:41.062
LAURA: This is true. I agree with Fjord.

00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:42.685
LIAM: Okay.

00:33:42.685 --> 00:33:47.248
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull the rock that I used
for that front from the wall, and I'm going to

00:33:47.248 --> 00:33:52.137
give us a couple feet in, if that's possible, just
to push something. I've been looking at

00:33:52.137 --> 00:33:55.432
Stone Shape and what it'll do.

00:33:55.432 --> 00:34:02.550
MATT: You essentially diffuse element of that
rock away from it to create the shell on the

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.757
opposite side. Totally doable. You create a hut?

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:11.772
LIAM: I take out my book, and I slap it down on
the stone surface of this chamber we are in. I

00:34:11.772 --> 00:34:17.641
take about ten minutes, and then there is a
hemisphere that is the same color as the chamber

00:34:17.641 --> 00:34:23.268
around us. As soon as that is done, I then take
out the silver thread, and I start making a little

00:34:23.268 --> 00:34:27.711
white picket fence that's not actually a
picket fence in front of that.

00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:32.940
MATT: You guys take your evening's rest.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:41.409
LAURA: Wait! I'm going to use Sending. I'm going
to send a message to Yussa, and I'm going to say--

00:34:42.288 --> 00:34:50.666
shit, I didn't have time to write it out. Hello!
It's Jester. We're bringing that dodecahedron

00:34:50.666 --> 00:35:01.116
with us. We're on our way to...
(whispering) I can't remember the name of the--

00:35:01.116 --> 00:35:02.197
SAM: Xhorhas.

00:35:02.197 --> 00:35:06.663
LAURA: Xhorhas. Do you think it's dangerous?
Should we not?

00:35:07.362 --> 00:35:08.667
SAM: Is that it?

00:35:08.667 --> 00:35:10.241
TRAVIS: Five more.

00:35:10.242 --> 00:35:12.298
LAURA: Please respond to this message.

00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:14.396
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:35:14.902 --> 00:35:16.428
SAM: Getting good at this.

00:35:16.428 --> 00:35:17.931
LAURA: Yeah, right?

00:35:18.755 --> 00:35:30.256
MATT: There's a pause. Then the voice comes
through, "Well, I would say it is not advised to

00:35:30.256 --> 00:35:39.970
"give it up, to pull it out of your bag. But
who am I to keep you from taking an artifact

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.072
"into the heart of danger?"

00:35:45.138 --> 00:35:46.875
LAURA: I think he's cool with it.

00:35:48.203 --> 00:35:49.890
SAM: We're making the right choice.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.804
TRAVIS: This is 100% what we're supposed
to be doing.

00:35:52.804 --> 00:35:57.037
MATT: You have a high enough wisdom to know
that there was a hint of biting sarcasm to his

00:35:57.037 --> 00:35:59.547
statement, but interpret that as you will.

00:35:59.547 --> 00:36:02.470
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.904
TRAVIS: Confirmation. We're doing good.

00:36:06.441 --> 00:36:10.278
MATT: Now, is everyone taking a comfortable
evening's rest within the hut?

00:36:10.278 --> 00:36:14.285
TRAVIS: Do we want to take watches? We're pretty
safe, right?

00:36:14.285 --> 00:36:15.915
SAM and TALIESIN: No watch needed.

00:36:15.915 --> 00:36:20.721
LAURA: I mean, unless somebody wants to keep a
watch and make sure nothing comes by.

00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:23.824
TALIESIN: That's what the thread-- the thread will
wake us if it--

00:36:23.824 --> 00:36:27.775
MATT: You do have a pretty decent setup, between
the Tiny Hut and the Alarm threads.

00:36:27.775 --> 00:36:30.112
TRAVIS: Let's all try it. Everybody's sleeping.

00:36:30.112 --> 00:36:34.737
LAURA: Get a good night's sleep. Can you put a
night light on, though, because it's really pretty.

00:36:35.462 --> 00:36:37.815
MARISHA: Ooh.

00:36:37.815 --> 00:36:48.943
LIAM: I also send Frumpkin out of the hut to sit
in the shadows of the chamber, and I tell him to

00:36:48.943 --> 00:36:54.349
come and wake me up if he hears anything coming
further than the perimeter of the alarm.

00:36:54.349 --> 00:37:04.593
MATT: Okay. You guys all find yourself to rest
here, deep beneath the surface of Exandria. For

00:37:04.593 --> 00:37:14.897
some of you, dreams come. For some of you, no,
it's a clean sleep-to-wake experience, until

00:37:14.897 --> 00:37:19.776
eventually, you slowly come to consciousness,
feeling rested, though strange to not have a day

00:37:19.776 --> 00:37:24.406
or night cycle. Nothing has changed from your
experience. You feel like you've rested, but have

00:37:24.407 --> 00:37:28.699
you? It could have been an hour; it could have
been eight hours. Being this far beneath the

00:37:28.699 --> 00:37:33.215
surface for an extended period of time is going
to be a little strange for those of you who have

00:37:33.215 --> 00:37:36.456
not had that experience, which is all of you.

00:37:36.456 --> 00:37:42.142
LIAM: Legitimate question, because I don't
want to dick with the story you're weaving,

00:37:42.142 --> 00:37:45.435
but does Keen Mind cut through that?

00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:52.078
MATT: You would know-- that's a good question.
Let me look it up real fast.

00:37:52.438 --> 00:37:55.713
TRAVIS: Look how pretty that book is. God. Sexy.

00:37:55.713 --> 00:37:57.956
SAM: It really is sexy.

00:37:58.826 --> 00:38:01.862
MATT: "You always know the number of hours left
before the next sunrise or sunset." I'd say, yeah,

00:38:01.862 --> 00:38:07.228
you'd be able to tell everyone. Even just
informing everyone of the time, it's still--

00:38:07.228 --> 00:38:09.734
LIAM: It won't mean anything to them.
They'll be--

00:38:09.734 --> 00:38:14.466
MATT: You can say it and be like: Oh yeah, guys,
it's 9:00 in the morning! You're like: cool.

00:38:14.466 --> 00:38:22.145
No issues. Nothing has changed. Frumpkin did not
notice anything out of the ordinary. As the hut

00:38:22.145 --> 00:38:28.110
comes to a close, and you step out from behind the
somewhat created stone shell placed by Caduceus,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.249
the tunnel is yours.

00:38:32.578 --> 00:38:35.547
TALIESIN: Lighting it up again because it's nice.

00:38:35.547 --> 00:38:38.036
SAM: On we go!

00:38:38.036 --> 00:38:45.402
LIAM: Frumpkin also skips up Nott's back and
snuggles in, grips her clothing with her claws--

00:38:45.402 --> 00:38:50.637
his claws, damn my original cat--
and scarfs around Nott's neck.

00:38:50.637 --> 00:38:57.250
MATT: You got it. As Frumpkin keeps you
warm in the throat region,

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.358
you all continue onward. Same order?

00:38:59.358 --> 00:39:00.559
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:04.865
MATT: Those helming the charge at the
front, either each take an individual

00:39:04.865 --> 00:39:07.766
perception check, or you may
help for advantage.

00:39:07.766 --> 00:39:09.654
LAURA: Go for it? Okay, okay, okay.

00:39:09.654 --> 00:39:10.938
LIAM: Mage Armor.

00:39:10.938 --> 00:39:12.844
MATT: Mage Armor, yeah, good call.

00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:19.140
LAURA: 19 again.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:28.229
MATT: Nice. A few more miles of winding tunnel
continue before you, and it's a very trying,

00:39:28.229 --> 00:39:38.319
monotonous experience, where it's lengths of
time and travel where there's no real change

00:39:38.357 --> 00:39:47.545
in topography. Slight variations as it winds in
this natural shifting with the physicality of the

00:39:47.545 --> 00:39:55.500
creature that burrowed it, but it's this
cylindrical of stone and earth for hours

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:04.670
and hours, until you catch the next first glimpse
of another chamber opening before you.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:08.372
LAURA: Do I see any movement in it?

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:15.502
MATT: You do not see any movement. As you get a
little closer, you can begin to see the interior

00:40:15.503 --> 00:40:21.272
of the chamber near where it opens up inside. The
air here is already pretty chilly, here beneath

00:40:21.272 --> 00:40:27.473
the surface. The air has more moisture to it than
the tunnel you've been traveling through.

00:40:27.473 --> 00:40:33.152
You can smell a bit of that heavy mineral
subterranean water scent. You listen in for

00:40:33.153 --> 00:40:38.859
a second, and you can hear the subtle dripping
of condensation, probably from the ceiling,

00:40:38.859 --> 00:40:43.880
which means there's probably a nearby water
source somewhere in the vicinity.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.474
There is a chamber that opens up ahead of you.

00:40:46.474 --> 00:40:48.700
LAURA: There's a chamber ahead of us.

00:40:48.897 --> 00:40:49.866
SAM: Oh my god!

00:40:49.867 --> 00:40:51.458
LAURA: It sounds wet, Nott.

00:40:51.458 --> 00:40:52.294
SAM: No!

00:40:52.294 --> 00:40:55.254
LAURA: I know. I know.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:56.826
SAM: Ah!

00:40:56.826 --> 00:41:00.060
LAURA: I didn't think we'd have to deal
with a water issue down here.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.076
SAM: Well, you said it sounds wet?
What does that even mean?

00:41:03.076 --> 00:41:05.740
LAURA: There could be an underground river.
I don't know.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.755
SAM: Or it could just be wet.

00:41:07.755 --> 00:41:09.433
TRAVIS: (dripping water noises)

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:12.477
LAURA: Or yeah, it could be that. Or it
could be a water monster.

00:41:12.477 --> 00:41:17.089
SAM: Or Fjord could be dicking around
with his cheek trick.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:18.804
TRAVIS: Sorry, was I throwing you?

00:41:18.804 --> 00:41:21.866
LAURA: When we approach it, I'm going to cast
Pass Without a Trace on all of us, and

00:41:21.866 --> 00:41:24.967
we'll approach it stealthily. What do you
guys think about that?

00:41:24.967 --> 00:41:26.421
SAM: Yes, yes, yes! Good idea.

00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:30.669
LAURA: Okay. We're approaching it stealthily.

00:41:30.669 --> 00:41:33.922
MATT: Roll stealth checks for me, please.

00:41:33.987 --> 00:41:36.506
SAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Stealth checks!

00:41:36.854 --> 00:41:38.647
SAM: Don't fuck me, Gil.

00:41:38.648 --> 00:41:40.433
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

00:41:40.433 --> 00:41:41.608
LAURA: Add ten.

00:41:41.608 --> 00:41:42.437
TRAVIS: 30.

00:41:42.437 --> 00:41:44.362
MATT: Pass Without a Trace. Good call.

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.514
LAURA: Oh, what, is everybody going?

00:41:46.514 --> 00:41:48.130
TALIESIN: Yeah, we already did it.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:48.839
TRAVIS: 30.

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:49.556
TALIESIN: 21.

00:41:49.557 --> 00:41:50.416
MARISHA: 31.

00:41:50.416 --> 00:41:51.188
LAURA: 24.

00:41:51.188 --> 00:41:52.918
SAM and LIAM: 30.

00:41:52.918 --> 00:41:54.676
MATT: Did you roll for Yasha as well?

00:41:54.676 --> 00:41:59.093
TRAVIS: Oh, balls and anus. Here you go. 22. No!

00:41:59.093 --> 00:42:00.652
LAURA: Plus ten?

00:42:00.973 --> 00:42:02.540
TRAVIS: 24.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:13.047
MATT: Moving into the chamber as it opens in,
you can see this area has quite a heavy clustering

00:42:13.047 --> 00:42:19.405
of stalagmites and stalactites all across the
interior of this chamber. It opens up maybe

00:42:19.405 --> 00:42:25.832
40 or so feet wide, and it seems to curve around
this large bend. Elements of it rise. While you

00:42:25.832 --> 00:42:30.834
do not see a river, looking up at where the
water's dripping from, you get the sense

00:42:30.834 --> 00:42:36.926
there might be a large body of water not that
far above. Elements of the groundwater are

00:42:36.926 --> 00:42:43.306
trickling through, and elements are gathering
to create the interior of this chamber.

00:42:43.306 --> 00:42:46.086
TALIESIN: I did not prepare for that.

00:42:46.086 --> 00:42:48.582
LAURA: What would be above us?

00:42:48.582 --> 00:42:51.991
TRAVIS: Oh, a river, pond.

00:42:51.992 --> 00:42:53.326
TALIESIN: There was a river.

00:42:53.326 --> 00:42:54.901
MARISHA: Underwater water source?

00:42:54.901 --> 00:42:58.527
LAURA: Yeah, where are we? We could figure
out where we are. Where's the map?

00:42:58.528 --> 00:43:00.675
LIAM: We've been traveling for miles, though.

00:43:00.675 --> 00:43:03.154
LAURA: Yeah, but we know which direction
we're going.

00:43:03.154 --> 00:43:05.960
LIAM: That's true, I know which way is north.
It's that way.

00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:07.631
MATT: Yes. You know where north is.

00:43:07.631 --> 00:43:09.772
LAURA: We're under the big river then, maybe.

00:43:09.773 --> 00:43:12.768
MATT: You don't have a GPS, per se, but
you know where north is.

00:43:12.768 --> 00:43:17.489
LIAM: No, but the whole time we've been walking,
I've been conscious of which direction north is in.

00:43:17.489 --> 00:43:21.860
MATT: Right, so you have a vague idea. You've
been traveling for a day from Felderwin, right?

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:29.549
So it's about, say, 24 miles in a day.
You'd be about there. This vicinity here,

00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:31.384
so you're right in this vicinity.

00:43:31.384 --> 00:43:35.875
TRAVIS: Yep, big-ass body of water.
Big enough to show up on a map.

00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:41.929
MATT: There are the heavy stalagmites and
rock protrusions from the ground that

00:43:41.929 --> 00:43:45.336
litter the interior of the chamber as it
curves off to the side.

00:43:45.336 --> 00:43:49.124
TALIESIN: Well, that's a good sign. That means
that this is at least a natural cavern, which

00:43:49.124 --> 00:43:53.542
means it's been here for a long time, and
whatever's above hasn't disturbed it.

00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:55.024
LAURA: Good point.

00:43:55.034 --> 00:43:57.036
TALIESIN: That's good. That's a good sign.

00:43:57.036 --> 00:44:01.511
LIAM: From where we are-- I don't know if I can,
because I can only see from this little bit of

00:44:01.511 --> 00:44:05.172
dim light, but where from this chamber the
worm continued on straight through?

00:44:05.172 --> 00:44:07.505
MATT: You cannot see where the worm went through.

00:44:07.505 --> 00:44:08.983
LIAM: Can't see the other side?

00:44:08.983 --> 00:44:13.038
MATT: Can't see the other side. It looks like
the worm, when it entered this chamber--

00:44:13.038 --> 00:44:16.274
you don't see in your vicinity where it
may have continued to burrow.

00:44:16.274 --> 00:44:17.703
LAURA: Oh, we have to find it.

00:44:17.703 --> 00:44:21.795
MATT: You get the sense that maybe this creature,
and the people that were steering it,

00:44:21.795 --> 00:44:25.321
were leading it through whatever open
chambers were possible, and then only

00:44:25.321 --> 00:44:27.277
burrowing when there was no continuation.

00:44:27.277 --> 00:44:30.414
LIAM: Maybe gave it a run-around in here,
like a dog in a dog park.

00:44:30.414 --> 00:44:34.223
LAURA: I guess we should search around and
see if we can find a hole in the wall.

00:44:34.223 --> 00:44:38.168
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to have a little
light and see if I can find any tracks or

00:44:38.168 --> 00:44:40.839
anything for this thing, or any other footprints.

00:44:40.839 --> 00:44:42.721
MATT: Make a survival check.

00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:49.854
MARISHA: I look to see if there's any signs of
life, any humans that have been here before, people.

00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:52.685
MATT: You're looking for...?

00:44:52.758 --> 00:44:55.864
MARISHA: Signs of life or signs that
people have been here before?

00:44:55.865 --> 00:44:57.324
TRAVIS: Biped signs of life?

00:44:57.324 --> 00:44:59.134
LAURA: Follow their path or something?

00:44:59.134 --> 00:45:01.614
MARISHA: Yeah, campfires that have been
extinguished.

00:45:01.614 --> 00:45:04.942
MATT: Okay, so both of you are looking for
essentially signs of things.

00:45:04.942 --> 00:45:06.940
LAURA: I will look for a hole in the wall.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.244
MATT: Okay. Perception check and then
survival check from each of you.

00:45:10.244 --> 00:45:11.412
TALIESIN: I got a 21.

00:45:11.562 --> 00:45:12.618
MATT: 21? Okay.

00:45:12.898 --> 00:45:14.092
SAM: You got this.

00:45:14.092 --> 00:45:14.848
MARISHA: 11.

00:45:14.848 --> 00:45:15.998
SAM: You don't got this.

00:45:15.999 --> 00:45:18.459
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;Nein&lt;/i&gt;! Wait, plus-- 14!

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:25.660
MATT: That's better. All right. Looking around,
you continue to see the footfalls, the footprints

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:33.125
along the patches of ground where it seems like
dirt and dust has been settled in areas that are

00:45:33.125 --> 00:45:42.324
a little bit wet from the moisture in the air. You
can see some of these grimy recesses in the muck

00:45:42.324 --> 00:45:46.762
and the dirt that is similar to the footfalls
you've already seen in previous chambers of what

00:45:46.762 --> 00:45:55.579
appears to be of the Kryn. You can see some of the
stone formations in the ground. Two of them appear

00:45:55.579 --> 00:46:00.649
to be broken and pushed over where it looks like
the creature may have shoved its way through.

00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:06.404
It goes around the edge and then curves up out of
sight. You can try to continue to look in that

00:46:06.405 --> 00:46:11.116
direction, but from what you can see the
vicinity, that's the path it's taking.

00:46:11.913 --> 00:46:13.313
You were looking for...?

00:46:13.313 --> 00:46:14.549
LAURA: Holes in the walls.

00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:19.342
MATT: Holes in the wall? All right. Looking around
the vicinity, you don't see any holes in the wall.

00:46:19.342 --> 00:46:24.797
You do see there are elements in the rock where
there are cracks and you can see where small bits

00:46:24.797 --> 00:46:29.119
of water are slowly dribbling through and then
(dripping).

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:32.249
LAURA: I bet the rock formations in this room
are amazing.

00:46:32.249 --> 00:46:35.538
MATT: They're pretty decent.

00:46:35.538 --> 00:46:39.421
LAURA: That one looks like a fried egg,
look at that. Do you see it?

00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:40.395
SAM: I do.

00:46:40.395 --> 00:46:42.826
LAURA: Looks like an egg on the top. Do you see?

00:46:42.827 --> 00:46:47.267
SAM: I do. And it's even a little bit yellow.
You should probably paint a dick on it.

00:46:47.267 --> 00:46:49.857
LAURA: I probably should.

00:46:49.858 --> 00:46:52.437
SAM: I mean, you could tag the whole place.

00:46:52.437 --> 00:46:56.167
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god, I should make this
a temple to the Traveler!

00:46:56.167 --> 00:46:57.288
SAM: Yes!

00:46:57.289 --> 00:47:02.617
TRAVIS: Well, Jester, aren't temples better served
by like, heavy foot traffic? You know--

00:47:02.617 --> 00:47:06.989
LAURA: Yeah but think about how cool it would be
if someone came down here and they were like

00:47:06.989 --> 00:47:09.081
"what's going on?" and then they find like--

00:47:09.081 --> 00:47:10.310
SAM: It's a speakeasy.

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:11.551
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:47:11.551 --> 00:47:13.098
SAM: But it's like a pray-easy.

00:47:13.098 --> 00:47:17.689
LAURA: And then they like, they find it, they're
going to be like: "That is like, so important.

00:47:17.689 --> 00:47:22.433
I must definitely worship this guy because..." And it
will at least get one person you know, added--

00:47:22.434 --> 00:47:24.211
SAM: You could be the bouncer.

00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:27.060
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, but how much time do you need
to dig up this cave?

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:32.759
LAURA: I don't! I'm just going to... I'm going
to paint, you know, a really nice picture of

00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:37.901
the Traveler. Then I'm going to use my paint--
my special paint-- and I'm going to make

00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:43.236
a nice little figurine of the Traveler. And I'll
sit it on top of the best-looking rock formation

00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:48.700
that looks like it's definitely for him.
I'm going to paint like, pretty things

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.848
around him like sparkles and shit.

00:47:50.848 --> 00:47:53.393
MATT: Perfect. So you paint a little figure
of the--

00:47:53.394 --> 00:47:57.259
TRAVIS: We'll keep an eye on the entrance
and exits.

00:47:57.259 --> 00:47:59.137
MATT: So you're watching the entrance--

00:47:59.137 --> 00:48:03.781
TRAVIS: I'll go to over where we think from
Beau's notes the creature seems to have gone.

00:48:03.781 --> 00:48:06.998
MATT: Okay. So yeah, as you walk over there,
there is an area where it curves in then rises up

00:48:06.998 --> 00:48:11.210
a little bit. To the left, you can see a
small pool of water where it's gathered

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:16.926
and created this little tucked in the side pool,
maybe five-foot by 15 feet.

00:48:16.926 --> 00:48:20.907
TALIESIN: Does it smell clean, is it clear?

00:48:20.907 --> 00:48:24.049
MATT: Go ahead and get close to it,
it looks clear. It looks very--

00:48:24.049 --> 00:48:25.699
TALIESIN: Can I see the bottom?

00:48:25.699 --> 00:48:30.594
MATT: You can see the bottom, it looks to be no
more than have five, six feet deep. You can see

00:48:30.594 --> 00:48:35.708
where it continues up off to that side.
Jester finishes painting the statue.

00:48:35.708 --> 00:48:39.817
You look around for somewhere to place it.
There are a number of these larger

00:48:39.817 --> 00:48:46.485
rock formations, five, ten feet tall, eight-foot
tall, little squat ones. What do you want?

00:48:47.219 --> 00:48:49.849
LAURA: I'm going to put it on the
little squat one.

00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:50.903
MATT: Okay.

00:48:50.903 --> 00:48:55.583
LAURA: But then put some of the crystals
that I got in my pocket, like around it.

00:48:55.583 --> 00:49:01.260
Then on the tall formation, I'm going to write
"The Traveler is the tits! Worship him!"

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:01.996
SAM: Nice.

00:49:01.996 --> 00:49:03.152
LAURA: Like, vertically.

00:49:03.152 --> 00:49:06.577
MATT: Perfect. All right. She's writing that down.
You were at the front?

00:49:06.577 --> 00:49:07.290
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.723
MATT: Who's watching the back?

00:49:08.733 --> 00:49:10.683
TALIESIN: I'll keep an eye on the back.

00:49:10.683 --> 00:49:15.010
MATT: All right. Perception check, both of you
guys, just to make sure you're keeping watch.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.302
MARISHA: Just looking over his shoulder.

00:49:17.302 --> 00:49:20.177
TRAVIS: Nice. 20-- 20. No, 21.

00:49:20.177 --> 00:49:22.050
TALIESIN: 24.

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:27.117
MATT: All right, you watch the distant path, the
dark that continues curving up off to the side.

00:49:27.117 --> 00:49:33.116
You look over there. No movement. You're looking
towards the tunnel where you guys came from.

00:49:33.116 --> 00:49:38.797
No movement. You hear the chuckles and look back
at what they're doing. You see one of these

00:49:38.797 --> 00:49:44.830
stalagmites, these tendrils (slurping).
Need to roll initiative.

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.192
(yelling)

00:49:47.192 --> 00:49:50.418
MATT: Actually, only you need to roll
initiative because they--

00:49:50.418 --> 00:49:53.200
SAM: They? They? He? It?

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.855
MATT and LAURA: They.

00:49:54.856 --> 00:49:56.350
MATT: Get a surprise round.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.785
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:49:57.785 --> 00:50:00.685
SAM: We all took feats that make us
immune to surprise, right?

00:50:00.685 --> 00:50:03.305
LAURA: Yeah, we all took Luck, right?
We all took Luck?

00:50:03.305 --> 00:50:06.397
TRAVIS: 18 is pretty good, considering
I have no initiative bonus.

00:50:06.398 --> 00:50:08.584
SAM and MARISHA: You have no initiative bonus?

00:50:08.584 --> 00:50:09.287
TRAVIS: No!

00:50:09.287 --> 00:50:10.569
SAM: What's wrong with you?

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:12.763
TRAVIS: I don't know. Half-orcs. I don't know.

00:50:12.763 --> 00:50:14.906
SAM: Why am I rolling these weird dice today?

00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:17.858
TRAVIS: I could have taken a feat that
would've given me, but--

00:50:17.858 --> 00:50:19.393
LAURA: Oh see? Think about how--

00:50:19.393 --> 00:50:20.475
ALL: Oh.

00:50:20.475 --> 00:50:21.831
TRAVIS: What is this thing?!

00:50:21.831 --> 00:50:22.576
LIAM: Ropers!

00:50:22.576 --> 00:50:23.767
SAM: This is a great map!

00:50:23.767 --> 00:50:25.151
LAURA: What are those things?

00:50:25.151 --> 00:50:27.575
TRAVIS: What is that sadistic Japanese
traffic cone?

00:50:27.575 --> 00:50:30.404
LAURA: So wait, where are we putting
the Traveler stuff?

00:50:30.404 --> 00:50:33.306
MATT: By this little tiny squat one.

00:50:33.306 --> 00:50:34.380
LAURA: Okay.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.456
LIAM: Oh my gosh.

00:50:35.456 --> 00:50:36.710
LAURA: Oh, it's so cool.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.609
SAM: They look like stalagmites!

00:50:38.609 --> 00:50:40.386
LIAM: We are in the kill zone, y'all.

00:50:40.387 --> 00:50:42.916
MATT: You were over on this side
looking off this way.

00:50:42.916 --> 00:50:44.770
TRAVIS: Oh fucking balls. What is this?

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:46.579
MATT: Nott, were you helping them out?

00:50:46.579 --> 00:50:49.152
SAM: No, I was hanging out with Beau.
Wherever Beau is.

00:50:49.152 --> 00:50:50.396
MATT: Beau is right there.

00:50:50.396 --> 00:50:51.484
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:50:51.484 --> 00:50:55.566
MATT: Yasha will be keeping an eye, not noticing.
Caleb, where were you?

00:50:55.566 --> 00:50:59.918
LIAM: I would be by the largest grouping of people
because I'm scared of everything.

00:50:59.918 --> 00:51:03.166
TRAVIS: (laughs) What the fuck is that?

00:51:04.576 --> 00:51:05.984
MATT: All right then.

00:51:06.354 --> 00:51:07.821
LIAM: This is real bad.

00:51:07.821 --> 00:51:08.980
TRAVIS: Is it?

00:51:08.981 --> 00:51:09.993
LIAM: Well...

00:51:09.993 --> 00:51:11.181
LAURA: No! It's real bad!

00:51:11.182 --> 00:51:12.909
LIAM: You don't know, I don't know.

00:51:12.909 --> 00:51:15.608
MATT: So. Initiative orders. 25 to 20.

00:51:15.608 --> 00:51:17.062
LAURA: Oh! I didn't roll...

00:51:17.062 --> 00:51:18.687
MATT: I just said roll initiative!

00:51:18.687 --> 00:51:22.205
LAURA: I know! But I thought you said
don't because they got a surprise...

00:51:22.206 --> 00:51:23.399
MATT: Just so we have it.

00:51:23.399 --> 00:51:24.843
LAURA: Oh no, six...

00:51:24.843 --> 00:51:26.716
MATT: Okay. 25 to 20.

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:27.886
MARISHA: 19.

00:51:27.886 --> 00:51:29.074
SAM: That's not 25 to 20.

00:51:29.074 --> 00:51:31.166
MARISHA: It's not, but no one else spoke up.

00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:32.032
MATT: It's fine.

00:51:32.032 --> 00:51:33.108
TRAVIS: 18 for Fjord.

00:51:33.108 --> 00:51:35.576
MATT: All right. 15 to ten.

00:51:35.576 --> 00:51:37.160
TRAVIS: Yasha got a 14.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.875
LIAM: 12 for Caleb.

00:51:38.876 --> 00:51:40.251
TALIESIN: 12 for me as well.

00:51:40.251 --> 00:51:41.586
SAM: 12 for me as well.

00:51:41.586 --> 00:51:43.415
LAURA: Lot of twelves.

00:51:43.415 --> 00:51:49.649
MARISHA: So Cad, Caleb, Nott.

00:51:49.649 --> 00:51:51.187
TALIESIN: This is going to be...

00:51:51.187 --> 00:51:52.625
SAM: It's going to be easy.

00:51:52.626 --> 00:51:54.446
MARISHA: I had a screamer earlier.

00:51:55.516 --> 00:51:57.743
MATT: Then we have Jester at the bottom.

00:51:57.743 --> 00:52:00.433
LAURA: I'm really distracted, you know,
because I'm--

00:52:00.803 --> 00:52:01.980
SAM: Painting.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.601
LAURA: I'm painting a beautiful--

00:52:03.601 --> 00:52:05.962
MATT: So. Fjord. You go first.

00:52:05.962 --> 00:52:06.998
TRAVIS: I do?

00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:11.645
MATT: You're the only one who noticed them in
this scenario. Because you were the one who's

00:52:11.645 --> 00:52:17.241
closest to the actual-- Caduceus is facing on the
back side of the chamber. What are you doing?

00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:24.636
TRAVIS: Well I have a short moment of freak out
as a rock formation grows fucking tentacles.

00:52:24.636 --> 00:52:29.389
MATT: Yep. Two of them. You see that one and go,
"Shit! Shit!" And you see them both go (gurgling).

00:52:29.389 --> 00:52:34.377
TRAVIS: Since the rest of the group doesn't seem
to have noticed them, I will charge up two

00:52:34.377 --> 00:52:36.659
Eldritch Blasts and send one in each direction.

00:52:36.659 --> 00:52:37.545
MATT: All righty.

00:52:37.545 --> 00:52:39.027
TRAVIS: Point both of them out.

00:52:39.037 --> 00:52:40.899
MATT: Go for it. Roll attacks for each.

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.413
TRAVIS: I will do it.

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.845
That is 16 to hit.

00:52:45.845 --> 00:52:51.930
MATT: It (poofing) just dissipates without
effect across its rocky, armored surface.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:57.051
TRAVIS: Not good. Can I bonus action Hex
the second one?

00:52:57.051 --> 00:52:57.975
MATT: Sure.

00:52:57.975 --> 00:52:59.647
TRAVIS: Before the other attack?

00:52:59.647 --> 00:53:00.888
MATT: Which one? This one?

00:53:00.888 --> 00:53:01.714
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:53:01.714 --> 00:53:02.879
MATT: All right.

00:53:02.879 --> 00:53:06.480
TRAVIS: That'll at least help a little bit. 17.

00:53:06.481 --> 00:53:10.194
MATT: (poofing). No effect. You watch as
the Eldritch energy, the green burst, just

00:53:10.194 --> 00:53:14.061
scatters across its rocky exterior.
No impact.

00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:15.670
TRAVIS: Big trouble!

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:16.974
SAM: What?

00:53:16.974 --> 00:53:18.299
MARISHA: What did you roll?

00:53:18.299 --> 00:53:22.675
TRAVIS: 17 didn't hit it. I'll come up on top of
that platform and take a little bit of cover

00:53:22.675 --> 00:53:27.154
behind that-- Yeah. Just right there is good.
I don't know what the fuck they do.

00:53:27.154 --> 00:53:30.864
SAM: Did we see these attacks fail?

00:53:30.865 --> 00:53:35.786
MATT: You all of a sudden heard a (poof) and
you heard him shout as you turn around and saw

00:53:35.786 --> 00:53:41.945
Fjord shout, "Big trouble!" and then vanish behind
a nearby rock. Like a hero.

00:53:41.945 --> 00:53:44.602
TRAVIS: Or a tactician!

00:53:44.602 --> 00:53:50.424
MATT: I know. In this moment of realization
of what's happening, these two large

00:53:50.424 --> 00:53:55.393
stalagmites suddenly have a single eye
that opens in the center, this burning red

00:53:55.393 --> 00:54:01.054
orange-ish eye with a vertical slit. The
center of it opens up into this large,

00:54:01.054 --> 00:54:05.036
gaping mouth of sharpened teeth and a
liquid tongue on the inside that's

00:54:05.036 --> 00:54:10.240
slimy-ing around. These four tendrils
that unravel. So it's now their turn.

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:14.264
It's going to move there. Five, ten.

00:54:14.264 --> 00:54:17.192
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter)

00:54:17.192 --> 00:54:19.945
SAM: They don't move fast, but-- oops.

00:54:19.945 --> 00:54:24.149
MATT: They shift, it looks like they're
gliding, but there's thousands of tiny cilia

00:54:24.149 --> 00:54:30.033
underneath that just cause them to glide
across the ground. This one on this end is

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:40.386
going to go ahead and make three attacks.
Each can make four tendril attacks.

00:54:41.306 --> 00:54:42.558
TRAVIS: Four?!

00:54:42.558 --> 00:54:43.737
MATT: Yes. So.

00:54:43.737 --> 00:54:45.501
LAURA: Oh my god, we're going to die.

00:54:45.501 --> 00:54:46.555
MARISHA: Oh, we might.

00:54:46.555 --> 00:54:47.935
SAM: No, you're going to die.

00:54:47.936 --> 00:54:50.167
MATT: Jester, that is a 21 to hit.

00:54:50.167 --> 00:54:51.482
LAURA: It hits me.

00:54:51.482 --> 00:54:53.105
MATT: All right. You are grappled.

00:54:53.105 --> 00:54:54.155
LAURA: Oh no.

00:54:54.155 --> 00:54:58.347
MATT: While you're grappled, you are restrained
and have disadvantage on strength checks.

00:54:58.347 --> 00:55:02.673
There's one now to Beau. That's going
to be a 14 to hit.

00:55:02.673 --> 00:55:03.734
MARISHA: Miss.

00:55:03.734 --> 00:55:06.718
MATT: Against Beau again, that's going
to be a 25 to hit.

00:55:06.718 --> 00:55:08.098
MARISHA: Ah yeah.

00:55:08.099 --> 00:55:11.510
MATT: So you are grappled.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:12.627
MARISHA: Just grappled?

00:55:12.627 --> 00:55:13.884
MATT: Yep.

00:55:13.885 --> 00:55:15.375
SAM: Oh, okay, they don't hurt.

00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:17.893
LAURA: Maybe the next turn they will
swallow us whole.

00:55:17.894 --> 00:55:19.114
SAM: I don't think so.

00:55:19.114 --> 00:55:21.083
TRAVIS: No evidence to support that.

00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:27.642
MATT: We'll say you're grappled, Beau.
You're also grappled. I'm putting

00:55:27.642 --> 00:55:31.895
restrained there because you are technically
restrained as well. Against Nott--

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:33.208
SAM: What, me?

00:55:33.208 --> 00:55:40.148
MATT: Yep. As it (whoosh) out that way,
that one's going to be 17?

00:55:40.148 --> 00:55:41.027
SAM: Miss.

00:55:41.027 --> 00:55:44.559
MATT: Misses. You just duck underneath.
The fourth one's going to swing out

00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:47.589
towards you as well. That's going to be a 20.

00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:48.570
SAM: Hit.

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:50.659
MATT: You are also grappled.

00:55:50.659 --> 00:55:54.618
LAURA: Oh my god, wait, was that all just
one creature attacking us or was that--?

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:55.987
MATT: Correct.

00:55:55.987 --> 00:55:58.154
SAM: There's no save against this grapple?

00:55:58.154 --> 00:56:02.060
MATT: You can try and escape it. It's an
action to try and escape from the grapple.

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:06.100
You can still attack, but you're restrained,
so you have disadvantage on your attacks.

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:09.714
MARISHA: Strength check versus their
strength check, if I remember correctly.

00:56:09.714 --> 00:56:12.974
MATT: It's your athletics or acrobatics,
you choose.

00:56:12.974 --> 00:56:13.963
LAURA: Okay.

00:56:13.963 --> 00:56:17.677
MATT: Now it's going to go ahead and make
a bite attack against Jester, because

00:56:17.677 --> 00:56:21.729
you're the closest one to it. Since you're
restrained, it has advantage on the attack.

00:56:21.729 --> 00:56:30.846
It's a natural 20 and a three. So natural 20
it is. So that's going to be-- Ooh, oh no.

00:56:32.417 --> 00:56:35.029
LAURA: If I go unconscious right away--

00:56:35.173 --> 00:56:36.917
SAM: It was a great game.

00:56:36.917 --> 00:56:39.217
LAURA: This was really fun, guys.

00:56:39.217 --> 00:56:41.136
TRAVIS: Stop rolling so many dice.

00:56:41.136 --> 00:56:43.833
LAURA: I went out doing what I love.

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:45.417
SAM: Painting dicks?

00:56:45.417 --> 00:56:51.089
MATT: 34 points of piercing damage from
the critical hit, as its tendril pulls you

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:56.077
in towards its mouth, shoves your shoulder
and the side of your neck into it, and it

00:56:56.077 --> 00:56:59.881
grinds down onto you. The armor pulls in
and you can feel it piercing the back of

00:56:59.881 --> 00:57:02.174
your neck. Sharp pain arcs through your body.

00:57:02.175 --> 00:57:03.296
LAURA: (pained noises)

00:57:03.296 --> 00:57:06.194
TRAVIS: Maybe we get the fuck out of here?
That was a big hit.

00:57:06.195 --> 00:57:09.568
MATT: This one here is going to go ahead
and go for Caleb for an attack.

00:57:09.568 --> 00:57:10.777
LIAM: Yeah.

00:57:10.777 --> 00:57:13.450
MATT: That's going to be a 14 to hit?

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:14.455
LIAM: Shield.

00:57:14.455 --> 00:57:19.065
MATT: Shield. (whoosh) It actually almost grabs
you and in the last minute, you throw your hand up

00:57:19.065 --> 00:57:23.635
and an arcane barrier flashes in front and
the tentacle gets knocked off limply. Yes?

00:57:23.635 --> 00:57:25.331
LAURA: Can I use my Hellish Rebuke?

00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:26.453
MATT: Yes, you may.

00:57:26.453 --> 00:57:28.297
LAURA: Okay. Is it okay?

00:57:28.298 --> 00:57:29.856
MATT: Go for it.

00:57:29.856 --> 00:57:31.198
LAURA: Ah, okay, okay, okay!

00:57:31.198 --> 00:57:33.194
MATT: He's got three more tendril attacks.

00:57:33.195 --> 00:57:34.092
LAURA: Oh, god!

00:57:34.092 --> 00:57:35.076
TRAVIS: Three more?

00:57:35.076 --> 00:57:36.804
MATT: Each round they get four each.

00:57:36.804 --> 00:57:38.018
TALIESIN: And a bite.

00:57:38.018 --> 00:57:38.769
MATT: Yep.

00:57:38.769 --> 00:57:42.448
TRAVIS: How about they fought in the
last week and one of them is missing one?

00:57:42.448 --> 00:57:45.513
MATT: Haven't encountered adventurers
in a while, buddy!

00:57:45.514 --> 00:57:48.999
TRAVIS: Like sharks in the wild and
they've got battle damage, you know?

00:57:48.999 --> 00:57:50.600
MATT: I admire your creativity.

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.580
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.939
LAURA: 3d10 damage.

00:57:52.939 --> 00:57:56.417
MATT: 3d10 damage. As it bites into you,
you angrily focus--

00:57:56.417 --> 00:58:02.449
LAURA: (screams) Ooh, 19 points of cold damage.

00:58:02.449 --> 00:58:04.027
MATT: And what's its save?

00:58:04.027 --> 00:58:06.538
LAURA: Oh, it's a dex save.

00:58:06.538 --> 00:58:08.458
MATT: Dex save. Haha, a two.

00:58:08.458 --> 00:58:10.133
LAURA: Yes!

00:58:10.133 --> 00:58:12.935
TALIESIN: The damage seems to take?

00:58:12.936 --> 00:58:17.089
MATT: The damage definitely takes.
(shattering) These ice crystals suddenly

00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:22.105
apparate around its mouth where it bit into
Jester, and it seems to pull back a bit,

00:58:22.106 --> 00:58:26.311
its eye closes and winces with the impact.
Now its other attacks. Its second attack

00:58:26.311 --> 00:58:28.737
against you, Caleb. That's going to be
an 18 to hit.

00:58:28.737 --> 00:58:29.643
LIAM: Does not hit.

00:58:29.643 --> 00:58:31.361
MATT: Because the Shield's still up.

00:58:31.361 --> 00:58:32.092
LIAM: Yeah.

00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:33.663
MATT: Deflects the second attack.

00:58:33.663 --> 00:58:34.632
TALIESIN: Thank god.

00:58:34.632 --> 00:58:36.682
MATT: Third one's going to go for Caduceus.

00:58:36.682 --> 00:58:38.063
TALIESIN: Is it close enough?

00:58:38.063 --> 00:58:40.263
MATT: It has a 50-foot range on its tendrils.

00:58:40.263 --> 00:58:43.716
(exclamations of shock)

00:58:43.716 --> 00:58:46.210
MATT: Reaches out. That's going to be a 21.

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:47.511
TALIESIN: That hits.

00:58:47.511 --> 00:58:48.508
MATT: All right.

00:58:48.508 --> 00:58:50.555
TRAVIS: That's terrible!

00:58:50.556 --> 00:58:55.291
TALIESIN: Okay, good to know! No, this
is good. So we're not going to waste time

00:58:55.291 --> 00:58:57.537
trying to be safe from these things.

00:58:57.537 --> 00:59:00.011
MATT: Now you are also grappled.

00:59:00.012 --> 00:59:03.060
TALIESIN: Again, what does grappled mean?
It means I can't move--

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:07.145
MATT: Well, you are considered grappled, but
while you're grappled, you are restrained,

00:59:07.146 --> 00:59:10.675
which means you have disadvantage on
attacks. You also have disadvantage on

00:59:10.675 --> 00:59:12.719
strength checks and strength saving throws.

00:59:12.719 --> 00:59:14.287
TALIESIN: Okay, and I can't move.

00:59:14.287 --> 00:59:16.283
MATT: You cannot move, your speed is zero.

00:59:16.283 --> 00:59:17.283
TALIESIN: That'll do.

00:59:17.283 --> 00:59:21.848
MATT: Its fourth and final tendril, it's going to
go ahead and shoot for Caleb again. Natural 20.

00:59:21.848 --> 00:59:22.844
LIAM: That hits.

00:59:22.844 --> 00:59:25.039
TALIESIN: He's within 30 feet of me, isn't he?

00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:26.135
MATT: Yeah.

00:59:26.135 --> 00:59:28.468
TALIESIN: All right, I'm canceling
the natural 20.

00:59:28.468 --> 00:59:30.701
MATT: Well it still hits, but it doesn't--

00:59:30.701 --> 00:59:33.065
TALIESIN: But the critical does not take.

00:59:33.065 --> 00:59:36.389
MATT: Right, it doesn't do any damage.
The tendril is just a--

00:59:36.389 --> 00:59:40.350
TALIESIN: Oh it's not a damage-- Oh, never
mind. So it doesn't get anything special.

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:43.872
MATT: Right, it gets one bite attack per
turn, but it grapples each of you.

00:59:43.872 --> 00:59:46.631
Just letting you know, you probably
want to hold onto that.

00:59:46.631 --> 00:59:49.921
TALIESIN: Okay, no, if it's not doing
anything, then there's no point.

00:59:49.921 --> 00:59:52.781
MARISHA: No, don't. Please stop, please stop,
don't touch me.

00:59:53.306 --> 00:59:55.958
TALIESIN: I am panicking, just a little.

00:59:56.007 --> 00:59:59.341
MATT: That's okay. You are also grappled
there, Caleb, and restrained.

00:59:59.341 --> 01:00:04.087
MARISHA: It was so pretty when we slept in a
geode. That was awesome. Remember that?

01:00:04.087 --> 01:00:05.237
TRAVIS: Yeah, draw that.

01:00:05.237 --> 01:00:08.960
TALIESIN: Is it time to start having the
flashbacks? Are we at flashback point?

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.343
MATT: It's going to use reel.

01:00:10.343 --> 01:00:14.410
TRAVIS: What do you mean "reel"?!
These attacks are real!

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:17.605
MATT: Pulls Caduceus into it,
and Caleb into it.

01:00:17.606 --> 01:00:22.828
TALIESIN: Okay, that's going to be interesting.

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:26.052
SAM: I lose all the close men in my life!

01:00:26.052 --> 01:00:30.043
MATT: It's going to make an attack against
you. As you are restrained, attack rolls

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:37.511
against you have advantage. A two and a one,
motherfuck. It goes towards to bite you,

01:00:37.511 --> 01:00:41.319
and the shield is still holding, and it's
pulling you in towards its mouth but

01:00:41.319 --> 01:00:44.724
you see the barrier pressing and bits of
its rock exterior are cracking,

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:47.593
being pressed up against this shield.

01:00:47.593 --> 01:00:51.165
LIAM: Caleb says: (whimpering apprehensively)

01:00:51.165 --> 01:00:54.946
MATT: All right, surprise round's done.
Top of the round, Beau, you're up first.

01:00:54.946 --> 01:01:00.344
MARISHA: Okay. Can I get closer to the roper?

01:01:00.344 --> 01:01:04.107
MATT: You are currently grappled and
restrained. You have no movement.

01:01:04.107 --> 01:01:10.142
MARISHA: I was hoping he would do the reel
thing, but to me, because I'd love to get real.

01:01:10.142 --> 01:01:13.939
MATT: Well, technically, you are adjacent
to it, because you're both right there

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.086
and it's in this space. You and
Jester are both adjacent to it.

01:01:17.086 --> 01:01:19.017
MARISHA: So I can hit it?

01:01:19.017 --> 01:01:22.937
MATT: Yes, you can hit it. Nott, it did not
reel you in that turn, because I forgot

01:01:22.937 --> 01:01:25.183
it can do the reel as part of its action.

01:01:25.183 --> 01:01:30.638
MARISHA: Well, I don't know what else
to do but to wail on this motherfucker.

01:01:31.201 --> 01:01:40.804
First attack is real bad; it's a natural two.
Next attack is not that much better, 20 total.

01:01:40.804 --> 01:01:44.871
MATT: Your attacks have disadvantage,
by the way, because you're restrained.

01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:50.121
MARISHA: Okay, then I will reroll that one
with a natural one. So that's cool.

01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:52.832
MATT: Miss. That two attacks so far?

01:01:52.832 --> 01:01:54.504
MARISHA: That's two attacks so far.

01:01:54.504 --> 01:01:58.513
MATT: The first attack, you can't quite get
your hand free. You manage to get it free

01:01:58.513 --> 01:02:04.198
for a second attack, and it hits the rock.
No impact. Still have your bonus action.

01:02:04.198 --> 01:02:06.821
SAM: She punched and it does nothing?

01:02:06.821 --> 01:02:08.263
MATT: She rolled low.

01:02:08.263 --> 01:02:13.036
MARISHA: I rolled a two then a one,
technically, but you roll disadvantage.

01:02:16.279 --> 01:02:19.690
Does disengage count if you're grappled?

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:21.749
TRAVIS: I don't know what these things are!

01:02:21.749 --> 01:02:26.485
MATT: You can disengage, but you still have no
movement. You have to escape from it to gain your

01:02:26.485 --> 01:02:30.767
movement speed back. Right now, you're wrapped
up by its tendril and you can't go anywhere.

01:02:30.767 --> 01:02:33.553
MARISHA: So disengage wouldn't help me
escape from it?

01:02:33.554 --> 01:02:37.132
MATT: No. Disengage prevents attacks of
opportunity, but you cannot get away

01:02:37.132 --> 01:02:38.463
from it to even trigger one.

01:02:40.943 --> 01:02:43.608
TRAVIS: Could you use your action,
if she hadn't already?

01:02:43.608 --> 01:02:47.163
MATT: Fjord, you're on deck, with Yasha
after that. You can use your action

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:49.479
to try and break free, yeah.

01:02:49.479 --> 01:02:59.368
MARISHA: But I already used my action to
attack, so I might as well Flurry of Blows.

01:02:59.368 --> 01:03:03.503
MATT: There you go. Flurry of Blows, get two
more strikes on it, each with disadvantage.

01:03:03.503 --> 01:03:09.312
MARISHA: Disadvantage on the first one.
Nope, that's a two again, second one is

01:03:09.312 --> 01:03:14.426
a natural 20 and a 12, bringing me
to a 20 total.

01:03:14.426 --> 01:03:19.585
MATT: 20 just hits. The first one doesn't
even get out, the second one hits the rock

01:03:19.586 --> 01:03:23.902
and hurts. You get your other arm free and
(impacts) into the stone again. This time

01:03:23.902 --> 01:03:26.882
you look down as the eye opens up and you
see the eye and go (whack) right into the

01:03:26.882 --> 01:03:31.305
center of its giant glowing eye.
Roll damage on that one.

01:03:31.305 --> 01:03:39.507
MARISHA: It's terrible. Two! Seven damage.
I turn to everyone and go:

01:03:39.507 --> 01:03:42.239
I think I broke my wrist. Then that's it.

01:03:42.239 --> 01:03:44.151
MATT: That's the end of your turn?

01:03:44.151 --> 01:03:45.729
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:45.729 --> 01:03:49.660
MATT: Cool. That brings us to Fjord.

01:03:49.661 --> 01:03:55.408
TRAVIS: I'll use my 30 feet and I will come around
that cover and I will run down to the--

01:03:55.408 --> 01:03:59.346
MARISHA: Can I do the thing? No, I have
to hit twice. Never mind, nope.

01:03:59.346 --> 01:04:02.634
MATT: You can do stunning strike if you
want to, but that's up to you.

01:04:02.634 --> 01:04:05.283
MARISHA: Oh! Can I do that?

01:04:05.283 --> 01:04:09.339
MATT: Yeah, even when you attack on your
Flurry of Blows, as long as you hit with

01:04:09.339 --> 01:04:10.670
an attack, you can do that.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:12.010
MARISHA: Stunning strike!

01:04:12.047 --> 01:04:17.158
MATT: All right, spend another ki point.
Constitution save, it's a natural one.

01:04:19.718 --> 01:04:21.326
Motherfuck.

01:04:21.698 --> 01:04:27.984
MARISHA: (fake crying) There is a god.
Okay, that's my turn.

01:04:27.984 --> 01:04:30.069
LIAM: And she's smiling on you.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:33.597
MARISHA: Yes, she is.

01:04:33.597 --> 01:04:38.692
MATT: We'll take this stunned token
and put it on this one.

01:04:39.632 --> 01:04:40.866
TRAVIS: That is a lot.

01:04:40.866 --> 01:04:43.335
LAURA: What is that other purple thing on him?

01:04:43.336 --> 01:04:44.372
MATT: That's Hex.

01:04:44.372 --> 01:04:45.348
LAURA: He's hexed?

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:49.198
MATT: Correct. Now, Fjord, you can take
your turn. As you take your turn, you look

01:04:49.198 --> 01:04:55.435
over and watch as Beau plunges her fist into
the eye of this living stalagmite and it

01:04:55.435 --> 01:05:00.982
starts suddenly wriggling in place.
It looks like it's having a rough time.

01:05:00.982 --> 01:05:05.300
TRAVIS: Amazing. I will run up and take
two swings with the Summer's Dance

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.368
falchion against the stunned...

01:05:08.368 --> 01:05:11.649
MATT: Your attacks have advantage on it
because it is stunned, yes.

01:05:11.861 --> 01:05:16.585
TRAVIS: That's amazing, okay.
That is a 29 to hit.

01:05:16.586 --> 01:05:18.006
MATT: That hits.

01:05:18.006 --> 01:05:21.950
TRAVIS: The second one is not as great.
That is only a 19. Misses.

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:26.417
MATT: Got you. 19 just barely misses,
unfortunately.

01:05:26.418 --> 01:05:40.017
TRAVIS: Yeah. All right. Eight, 12-- oh,
1d6 for Hex. 15 points of slashing damage.

01:05:40.017 --> 01:05:45.410
MATT: You rush up with one attack, carve
across with the scimitar, and you expect it

01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:49.478
to completely deflect the blow, but the blade
does cut through the rock. Where it splits

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:54.583
where the blade was, there is a muscly,
fleshy interior. The creature is heavily

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:59.836
armored by the shell it's created around
itself, but it's definitely mortal. Your

01:05:59.836 --> 01:06:04.891
second strike, however, glides against the
outside of its rocky shell and makes no damage.

01:06:04.891 --> 01:06:09.069
TRAVIS: I am going to use my bonus action
and use Misty Step on the falchion

01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:11.614
to bamf back up on the platform.

01:06:11.749 --> 01:06:13.548
MATT: All right. Right there?

01:06:13.548 --> 01:06:16.274
TRAVIS: Yep. And that is my turn.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:22.130
MATT: I would say, because you can only
Misty Step to places you can see, you can

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:25.745
go there, but you have five feet of
movement left, so you move there anyways.

01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:28.790
Just as a point of reference. That ends
Fjord's turn. Yasha's up.

01:06:28.791 --> 01:06:34.611
TRAVIS: Yasha would like to rage. She will
rush the traffic cone from hell that is

01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:42.198
attacking Caduceus and Caleb and take two
strikes with her Magician's Judge.

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:43.520
MATT: Go for it.

01:06:45.055 --> 01:06:46.942
TRAVIS: Reckless attacks, please.

01:06:47.096 --> 01:06:48.522
MATT: All righty.

01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:59.104
That is a natural 20 for the first one,
and the second one is only a ten.

01:06:59.104 --> 01:07:04.248
MATT: That first hit, all the impact and
might smashes into this creature's face,

01:07:04.249 --> 01:07:07.547
and she pulls back and, "That's all I had."

01:07:07.608 --> 01:07:20.836
TRAVIS: I love barbarians so much.
(counting) 13 times three is 39, right?

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:23.522
Yeah, 39 points of slashing damage.

01:07:23.522 --> 01:07:24.845
MATT: Times two, you mean?

01:07:24.845 --> 01:07:31.086
TRAVIS: Oh, times two, sorry, 26.
Not times three, times two. 26.

01:07:31.086 --> 01:07:33.163
MATT: Any bonuses on top of that?

01:07:33.163 --> 01:07:40.069
TRAVIS: That's it, yeah. Oh no, sorry,
rage is three. 29.

01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:45.643
MATT: 29 points of damage from that first strike
as the Magician's Judge carves down through it.

01:07:45.643 --> 01:07:49.858
One of the tentacles gets damaged and you can
see it still holding tight, but starting to wear

01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:53.646
this thing down. Still looking okay,
though. That finishes Yasha's turn?

01:07:53.646 --> 01:07:54.387
TRAVIS: It does.

01:07:54.387 --> 01:07:57.285
LIAM: Is that all the 12s? Is that all the
12s in a row?

01:07:57.285 --> 01:08:01.799
MATT: They're after the ropers. They're right
before you guys. They're squeezed right between

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:18.676
Yasha and your trio's turn. This one here is
going to reel in Nott. Now you get pulled.

01:08:18.676 --> 01:08:21.312
SAM: Wait, they can do that even though
they're stunned?

01:08:21.312 --> 01:08:27.517
MATT: Oh, that one's stunned, so it can't. Never
mind. That one right there is going to attempt to

01:08:27.518 --> 01:08:35.034
ensnare, with one of its free tendrils,
Yasha. That is going to be a 15 to hit?

01:08:35.034 --> 01:08:36.118
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:08:36.118 --> 01:08:41.048
MATT: It hits! She is also now grappled
and restrained. It's going to make

01:08:41.049 --> 01:08:43.814
a bite attack against Caleb.

01:08:43.814 --> 01:08:46.891
TRAVIS: So hitting it doesn't make them
drop the grapple.

01:08:46.891 --> 01:08:48.287
MATT: You have to break free.

01:08:48.287 --> 01:08:50.091
TRAVIS: I was hoping that would be the case.

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:51.512
MATT: That's another natural 20!

01:08:51.512 --> 01:08:52.533
TALIESIN: Cancelled.

01:08:52.533 --> 01:08:58.816
MATT: Reaction from Caduceus to-- what's
the ability called again? Channel Divinity?

01:08:58.816 --> 01:09:05.762
TALIESIN: It's actually not a Channel Divinity.
It's called "Sentinel at Death's Door."

01:09:05.762 --> 01:09:08.022
MATT: Was it once per short rest?

01:09:08.022 --> 01:09:10.235
TALIESIN: No, it's five times per long rest.

01:09:10.235 --> 01:09:12.737
LAURA and SAM: Five times?!

01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:15.712
TALIESIN: As long as I'm "within 30 feet of
somebody who suffers a critical hit, you can

01:09:15.712 --> 01:09:18.973
"turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effect
triggered by the critical hit is canceled."

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.069
MATT: Grave clerics, man. That's awesome.

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:22.372
TALIESIN: Five times per long rest.

01:09:22.372 --> 01:09:31.201
MATT: Well, be thankful he reduced
that critical. 28 points of piercing damage

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:39.710
as it jams your entire arm into its mouth
and it's starting to pull you in from the

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:47.047
torso up. The other one is stunned and does
not get its turn. That brings us to the trio.

01:09:47.047 --> 01:09:51.466
LIAM: One handed, Caleb gets the molasses
out and starts smearing it and casting--

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:52.868
TALIESIN: Wait, should I--

01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:54.564
MATT: He's already going. He's already on it.

01:09:54.564 --> 01:09:58.383
LIAM: I'm going, too late, and I cast Slow
on both of them.

01:09:58.384 --> 01:10:00.201
MATT: What's the save?

01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:01.385
LIAM: 16.

01:10:01.385 --> 01:10:03.128
MATT: What is it, wisdom?

01:10:03.128 --> 01:10:05.319
LIAM: Wisdom, yeah.

01:10:06.062 --> 01:10:09.537
MATT: This is for the guy over there.
14. He is slowed.

01:10:09.537 --> 01:10:15.983
LIAM: He can do one thing per round now,
while that's up. Yeah, it just brought all

01:10:15.983 --> 01:10:18.708
those tentacles down to one thing per round.

01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:21.570
MATT: That guy is a 15.

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:22.531
LIAM: Fails.

01:10:22.531 --> 01:10:23.800
MATT: They're both slowed.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.394
TALIESIN: Okay. It's about to get worse
for them.

01:10:26.394 --> 01:10:28.488
TRAVIS: Those circles are so great.

01:10:28.488 --> 01:10:31.465
MATT: Yeah, a fan sent those, actually.

01:10:31.465 --> 01:10:36.430
LIAM: A negative two penalty to AC and
dexterity saving throws. Can't use reactions.

01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:39.653
It can use either an action or a
bonus action, not both.

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:43.159
MATT: You've got it. Caleb, that's your go.

01:10:43.159 --> 01:10:45.930
LIAM: (pained yelling)

01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:50.715
MATT: Casting frantically with the off-hand.
Their whipping tendrils that are wrapping

01:10:50.715 --> 01:10:56.743
you all of a sudden go (slow-down sound).
Its chewing on Caleb is like (slow grinding).

01:10:56.743 --> 01:11:00.840
LIAM: I'm getting the molasses everywhere!

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:06.020
MATT: Jester's still part way in, like,
"Oh, god!" Slow chews. Nott or Caduceus.

01:11:06.021 --> 01:11:09.821
TALIESIN: I'll take it. Slow down, cowboy.
I'm casting Bane on these two.

01:11:09.821 --> 01:11:11.872
MATT: What's the save?

01:11:11.872 --> 01:11:14.073
TALIESIN: The save is a 16 charisma.

01:11:14.073 --> 01:11:15.997
MATT: Charisma? Oh, they are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; charismatic.

01:11:15.997 --> 01:11:18.039
TALIESIN: Yep. I didn't think they would be.

01:11:18.039 --> 01:11:22.401
MATT: There is a 12 and a zero.

01:11:22.401 --> 01:11:28.903
TALIESIN: That means that you have to take a
negative d4 to attack rolls and saving throws.

01:11:28.976 --> 01:11:30.497
MATT: Yeah, you've got it.

01:11:30.497 --> 01:11:33.653
TALIESIN: On both of them. I'm going to
then spend my bonus action, and

01:11:33.653 --> 01:11:42.252
I'm going to call a swarm of insects. I'm
going to drop it on the-- let's get one of

01:11:42.252 --> 01:11:45.401
these out of the way first. Let's get the
one that's far away from me.

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:49.932
I'm going to drop it right on him. That
swarm of insects is going to take a bite.

01:11:49.932 --> 01:11:54.996
MATT: Caduceus is pulled in, manages to
curse them both with this divine power

01:11:54.996 --> 01:12:02.631
pulled from the Wildmother's darker side of
nature, and then holds the staff up through.

01:12:02.631 --> 01:12:08.010
A burst of insects, beetles, then fly out
of it, clouding around this central

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:12.353
stalagmite, and begin to assault
the opposite side of the creature.

01:12:12.353 --> 01:12:14.975
TALIESIN: Hard to hit. Let's see if I can
actually hit because my to-hit is--

01:12:14.976 --> 01:12:16.587
MATT: It is still stunned, so you have
advantage on your attack.

01:12:16.587 --> 01:12:18.453
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's exciting.

01:12:18.453 --> 01:12:22.584
MATT: It's stunned until Beau's next turn.

01:12:22.584 --> 01:12:24.376
TALIESIN: 18 is the highest hit.

01:12:24.376 --> 01:12:27.837
MATT: 18 just hits because of the Slow
spell. Their AC is reduced by two.

01:12:27.837 --> 01:12:35.437
TALIESIN: This is a bite attack, which is
4d4. Hit ten, 4d4 piercing damage?

01:12:35.437 --> 01:12:38.385
It's ten plus 4d4, I believe?

01:12:38.385 --> 01:12:40.430
MATT: No, it's just 4d4.

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:42.485
TALIESIN: Why does it say ten?
I don't know.

01:12:42.485 --> 01:12:44.505
MATT: Ten is the average damage.

01:12:44.505 --> 01:12:49.800
TALIESIN: Oh. (counting) That's ten.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.806
MATT: Ten points of damage. The beetles are
now biting into the side of this entity.

01:12:53.806 --> 01:12:55.066
That finish your turn?

01:12:55.066 --> 01:12:57.107
TALIESIN: That finishes my turn.

01:12:57.107 --> 01:13:03.267
SAM: I will not try to leave the grapple.
Instead, I will fire a crossbow bolt

01:13:03.344 --> 01:13:06.425
at this one that has me grappled.

01:13:06.425 --> 01:13:07.440
MATT: You've got it.

01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:09.125
SAM: With advantage, because it's stunned?

01:13:09.125 --> 01:13:10.954
MATT: It is stunned, yes.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:14.193
SAM: Oh, not good. Both of them not good. 15.

01:13:14.193 --> 01:13:20.146
MATT: 15 misses. It ricochets off of its
rock-like hide. The bolt goes scattering

01:13:20.147 --> 01:13:21.328
off into the shadows somewhere.

01:13:21.328 --> 01:13:22.778
SAM: Bonus action, fire again.

01:13:22.778 --> 01:13:23.824
MATT: Go for it.

01:13:23.824 --> 01:13:25.525
TRAVIS: Tentacles made of rock as well?

01:13:25.525 --> 01:13:28.436
MATT: They appear to be of similar material.
They have a similar look to them,

01:13:28.436 --> 01:13:31.257
but they're flexible, so they're
probably not as--

01:13:31.257 --> 01:13:32.478
SAM: 28.

01:13:32.478 --> 01:13:36.056
MATT: 28 does hit, and it is adjacent--
well, it's stunned anyway,

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.329
so you do get your sneak attack damage on it.

01:13:38.329 --> 01:13:39.914
SAM: Yeah!

01:13:39.914 --> 01:13:41.128
MATT: All the dice.

01:13:41.128 --> 01:13:42.074
LAURA: Woo!

01:13:42.074 --> 01:13:52.477
SAM: Oh, there's a couple ones. Okay, 22.
Plus I'll do Fury of the Small;

01:13:52.477 --> 01:13:54.556
that's another eight. That's
30 points of damage.

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:55.996
TRAVIS: Boom!

01:13:55.996 --> 01:14:01.100
MATT: 30 points of damage, nice. As the first bolt
ricochets, you see a spark as the rock-like

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:06.186
exterior shoots it off. As it's sitting there
(groaning) with its one eye open, its jaw still

01:14:06.186 --> 01:14:11.418
chewing on Jester. Jester manages to wedge herself
out of its mouth just in time for you to aim the

01:14:11.418 --> 01:14:18.517
bolt into its throat. It begins to cough a bit
of its own blood. It's looking pretty hurt.

01:14:18.517 --> 01:14:20.216
SAM: Good, good.

01:14:20.216 --> 01:14:21.472
MATT: That ends your turn, Nott?

01:14:21.473 --> 01:14:22.326
SAM: That's all I've got.

01:14:22.326 --> 01:14:23.439
MATT: Jester, you're up.

01:14:23.439 --> 01:14:32.392
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to turn, since that one's
letting me go, and I'm going to put my hand

01:14:32.416 --> 01:14:38.409
towards the other one. I'll say: Get the fuck out
of my temple! I'm going to cast Banishment.

01:14:38.409 --> 01:14:40.410
MATT: Oh, shit!

01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:43.926
SAM: Banishment?! What!

01:14:43.926 --> 01:14:45.688
LAURA: Yeah. That's a charisma save.

01:14:45.688 --> 01:14:48.056
TRAVIS: Good call.

01:14:48.056 --> 01:14:52.510
MATT: It rolled a natural 16, minus two.

01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:55.561
(cheering)

01:14:55.561 --> 01:14:57.613
LAURA: It needed a 16 save, so--

01:14:57.613 --> 01:15:04.331
MATT: This guy vanishes. The tendrils are no
longer around you, so none of them are--

01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:07.605
TRAVIS: Thank god he didn't take anybody
with him.

01:15:07.606 --> 01:15:10.087
LAURA: Well, he wouldn't have done that here.

01:15:10.087 --> 01:15:14.763
MATT: You're all of a sudden released from it,
and the creature's just not there anymore.

01:15:14.763 --> 01:15:17.765
LAURA: He'll only be gone for a little bit.
We should probably get out of here.

01:15:17.765 --> 01:15:21.507
Also, kill this guy, huh? Then I turn back
to the dude that's in front of me.

01:15:21.507 --> 01:15:23.526
MATT: Right, because you're still
wrapped up by its tendrils.

01:15:23.526 --> 01:15:28.247
LAURA: Yeah. I can't do anything else,
I don't think. Yeah, that's all I can do.

01:15:28.247 --> 01:15:29.813
MATT: Beau, you're up.

01:15:29.813 --> 01:15:32.650
MARISHA: Ah! Doo-bah!

01:15:34.073 --> 01:15:36.602
MATT: It is stunned until the end of your
next turn, I believe, right?

01:15:36.683 --> 01:15:38.358
MARISHA: That's the way it works.

01:15:38.358 --> 01:15:41.316
MATT: You still have advantage on the
attacks. You have disadvantage

01:15:41.317 --> 01:15:44.313
because you're restrained, so it's just
a straight roll for you.

01:15:44.313 --> 01:15:45.417
MARISHA: I'm still restrained.

01:15:45.418 --> 01:15:47.161
TRAVIS: That Cobalt fighting style. Doo-bah!

01:15:47.161 --> 01:15:53.360
MARISHA: I'm going to stir around my stick
and try and jab it into his eyeball.

01:15:53.361 --> 01:15:54.591
MATT: Go for it.

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:56.186
MARISHA: Wait, straight roll?

01:15:56.187 --> 01:15:57.926
TRAVIS: Yeah, straight roll.

01:15:57.926 --> 01:16:02.133
MARISHA: I'm going to get rid of all those.
It never happened. I don't think it worked,

01:16:02.133 --> 01:16:05.361
nope. That's a 14?

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:10.107
MATT: 14 misses. You're punching a rock,
and it's hurting,

01:16:10.176 --> 01:16:12.556
but you're going to get through.
Looking for those soft spots.

01:16:12.556 --> 01:16:14.847
MARISHA: Second attack.

01:16:14.847 --> 01:16:17.065
LIAM: Ooh, it was almost a one,
and then it was better.

01:16:17.065 --> 01:16:19.472
MARISHA: Now it's a 19, so it definitely hits.

01:16:19.472 --> 01:16:20.908
MATT: Yes, that hits.

01:16:20.908 --> 01:16:29.356
MARISHA: That was with my staff I said,
so it's a d8. Seven points of damage.

01:16:29.357 --> 01:16:30.855
MATT: Seven points of damage.

01:16:30.855 --> 01:16:36.152
MARISHA: I'm going to re-stun it. Can I
do that? Stunning strike.

01:16:36.152 --> 01:16:40.948
MATT: That is an 18, so it resists it.

01:16:40.948 --> 01:16:43.131
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to move on from that.

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:48.190
TALIESIN: The d4! Wait, and also, is there
anything else he gets from Slow for saving throws?

01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:51.114
LIAM: Negative two AC and dex saves.

01:16:51.114 --> 01:16:54.488
MATT: That's minus two to it, so it's a 16.
What's your DC?

01:16:54.488 --> 01:16:56.001
MARISHA: 14.

01:16:56.001 --> 01:16:57.730
MATT: Yeah, so it resists it.

01:16:57.730 --> 01:17:03.449
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows! Wait, why do I
keep rolling twice? I keep thinking

01:17:03.449 --> 01:17:11.404
I need to roll twice. Just once. Ah!
Natural 20! It's so manic, but it's true.

01:17:11.404 --> 01:17:12.559
MATT: I saw it.

01:17:12.559 --> 01:17:17.966
MARISHA: Doubling the dice. That's a three
plus a six, so that's 11.

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:23.270
MATT: 11 points of damage on that strike. As
you jam the staff into the middle of its mouth

01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:27.458
and are prying it open, you get down and
see where its eye is trying to keep closed,

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:32.220
and the moment it flicks open to be aware of
its surroundings, you whack, poking it right there.

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:37.190
MARISHA: Going for the uvula. Last one. 18.

01:17:37.191 --> 01:17:39.659
MATT: 18 just hits, because of the Slow spell.

01:17:39.659 --> 01:17:44.041
MARISHA: For this one, I'm going to try and
grab onto its tongue, because I know,

01:17:44.041 --> 01:17:53.358
lot of blood vessels in the tongue, and
start trying to rip it. Another 11 damage.

01:17:53.358 --> 01:17:57.967
MATT: 11 points of damage. Oof, this thing
is not having a great moment.

01:17:57.968 --> 01:18:00.432
MARISHA: I say: Drop it! Drop it!

01:18:00.432 --> 01:18:03.201
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:07.521
TRAVIS: I'll run back up and take two
swipes with the Summer's Dance falchion.

01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:10.285
LAURA: I really hope you guys kill it
before it gets back to its turn.

01:18:10.285 --> 01:18:17.133
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too. First one is a 28,
and the second one is a 29.

01:18:17.133 --> 01:18:22.985
MATT: Both hit. Damn, nice. It is no
longer stunned. Actually, did you roll

01:18:22.985 --> 01:18:25.096
with advantage, or did you roll regularly?

01:18:25.096 --> 01:18:25.943
TRAVIS: Just straight.

01:18:25.943 --> 01:18:28.287
MATT: Good. It's no longer stunned, so you
do not have advantage on the attack.

01:18:28.369 --> 01:18:34.940
TRAVIS: Nice. Ten plus four is 14 points
of slashing damage, with four points

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:42.473
of necrotic in there from the Hex. The
second one is eight plus six, 14,

01:18:42.473 --> 01:18:47.716
plus five points of necrotic
for 19 points of damage.

01:18:47.716 --> 01:18:49.027
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:18:49.027 --> 01:18:51.378
(cheering)

01:18:51.379 --> 01:18:59.318
TRAVIS: Like a hero, I run up behind it and take
inspiration from Beau, and I go (whoosh).

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:00.859
Doo-bah!

01:19:00.859 --> 01:19:07.340
MATT: You see Fjord holding the pose there
for a second, as Beau's holding its tongue,

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:12.577
and the tongue comes out. You look past
and watch as its eye goes limp,

01:19:12.577 --> 01:19:16.360
and it shifts off into three separate pieces.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.816
LAURA: Hi, Fjord! Thank you.

01:19:18.816 --> 01:19:20.050
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:21.563
LAURA: We should leave.

01:19:21.563 --> 01:19:23.563
TALIESIN: How long does that thing stay--?

01:19:23.563 --> 01:19:26.706
LAURA: Not long at all. Like probably
another minute or so, so run?

01:19:26.706 --> 01:19:27.662
SAM: Okay, let's go.

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:30.538
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's book. Wait, who's--
yeah, we'll heal on the way.

01:19:30.538 --> 01:19:32.000
MATT: You guys book it.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.668
SAM: Do we need to loot the bodies?

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.197
LAURA: There's not-- it's rocks.

01:19:35.197 --> 01:19:38.872
TRAVIS: Actually, Yasha will run up to
Caleb as we're running, and she will do

01:19:38.872 --> 01:19:42.590
Healing Touch because she never does that
shit, to Caleb, and put-- what is it?

01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:50.194
Healing Hands, healing seven points.
She never wastes an action on that.

01:19:50.195 --> 01:19:51.577
SAM: Ropers.

01:19:51.577 --> 01:19:54.112
MATT: Ropers, man.

01:19:54.112 --> 01:19:55.832
TRAVIS: Is that what they're called?

01:19:55.832 --> 01:19:56.535
MATT: Yep.

01:19:56.535 --> 01:20:00.031
LIAM: We're on the move, &lt;i&gt;ja&lt;/i&gt;?
Hup, hup, hup.

01:20:00.031 --> 01:20:05.131
MARISHA: Caleb, do you have any use
for this? Nott? Nott.

01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:06.536
SAM: What's that? A tongue?

01:20:06.536 --> 01:20:07.601
MARISHA: Roper tongue.

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:08.869
SAM: Yeah, I'll take that.

01:20:08.869 --> 01:20:11.247
MATT: You can add a roper tongue to your
inventory.

01:20:11.247 --> 01:20:12.168
SAM: To my belly.

01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:14.640
MATT: There you go. That's the other inventory.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:17.348
LAURA: It's like beef jerky?

01:20:17.348 --> 01:20:18.910
MATT: It's pretty tough.

01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:20.124
TRAVIS: Like octopus.

01:20:20.124 --> 01:20:26.959
MATT: Strangely salty. It's the minerals.
As you guys are rushing up around the edge,

01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:33.284
the cavern ends about another 50 or 60 feet
up front. It just ends.

01:20:33.284 --> 01:20:34.344
MARISHA: What?

01:20:34.344 --> 01:20:35.868
SAM: This is not the right way.

01:20:35.868 --> 01:20:39.254
TRAVIS: Oh. Let's go back and check that water.

01:20:39.254 --> 01:20:41.479
SAM: But if we go back the thing will be back.

01:20:41.479 --> 01:20:44.585
TALIESIN: Why don't we all prepare?
I haven't put my insects away,

01:20:44.585 --> 01:20:46.684
and we can just kill this thing off, really.

01:20:46.684 --> 01:20:48.489
MATT: Jester, make a perception check.

01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:53.724
TALIESIN: I still have a swarm of insects.
I'm, for the moment,

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:56.279
going to keep my insects down there,
just in case.

01:20:56.279 --> 01:20:58.037
LAURA: 12.

01:20:58.037 --> 01:21:07.717
MATT: You're looking around, and the tracks
that you noticed earlier, you guys pick up on,

01:21:07.717 --> 01:21:14.452
and you see that it is still traveling this
direction. You can glance at the area,

01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:19.409
though the wall itself is this surface of
loose rock and stone formations there.

01:21:19.409 --> 01:21:23.119
TRAVIS: Can I walk up and touch it, and
see if any of it moves or is different?

01:21:23.119 --> 01:21:26.833
MATT: Following the tracks, there is an
area where it looks like the stones are

01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:30.118
just loosely there. Part of the wall fell
in and covered the interior,

01:21:30.118 --> 01:21:31.740
but you can pull stones out of it.

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.458
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll start doing that.

01:21:33.458 --> 01:21:36.832
LIAM: I'm going to keep my eyes behind us
where we just ran away from.

01:21:36.832 --> 01:21:38.402
LAURA: Yeah, same, I'm going too.

01:21:38.402 --> 01:21:42.256
MATT: Okay, so you start pulling stones
out and passing them off. Some of them are

01:21:42.257 --> 01:21:46.153
pretty heavy. Yasha is helping. You guys
are pulling them out one by one. You get a

01:21:46.153 --> 01:21:50.055
small section of opening available to you.
It wasn't a huge collapse. It looks like

01:21:50.055 --> 01:21:54.001
when it was passing through, it might have
bumped into the wall and caused a portion

01:21:54.001 --> 01:21:58.050
of it to fall in, and it's only the lack of
light in here that's really making it hard

01:21:58.050 --> 01:22:01.524
to originally even notice this exit.
You get halfway through it before you

01:22:01.524 --> 01:22:03.282
hear (whoosh) in the room behind you.

01:22:03.282 --> 01:22:04.663
SAM and LAURA: Oh, it's back.

01:22:04.664 --> 01:22:07.038
TALIESIN: Is it back to exactly
where it was before?

01:22:07.038 --> 01:22:07.746
MATT: Yes.

01:22:07.746 --> 01:22:10.316
TALIESIN: It's immediately attacked
by an insect swarm.

01:22:10.317 --> 01:22:14.561
MATT: Go for it. It moves very slow. You
glance back in the area and it goes (squelching).

01:22:14.561 --> 01:22:18.474
It moves ten feet a round, and you're about
a hundred feet from it around that way.

01:22:18.474 --> 01:22:20.478
LAURA: Good. But it's got a 50-foot reach!

01:22:20.478 --> 01:22:21.199
TALIESIN: 22.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.919
MATT: It'll be about another minute before
it gets within range. 22? That hits!

01:22:24.919 --> 01:22:28.743
Technically, it's still-- No, it's not slowed
anymore, because Slow has worn off.

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:31.117
LIAM: It's a minute duration.

01:22:31.117 --> 01:22:33.258
MATT: Right, it's been banished for a minute.

01:22:33.259 --> 01:22:37.163
LIAM: Okay. Magic Missiles.

01:22:37.163 --> 01:22:38.523
MATT: (laughing) Go for it!

01:22:38.523 --> 01:22:40.856
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's right. We can
shoot at it.

01:22:40.867 --> 01:22:45.195
MATT: You can still attack from a distance. It's
about a hundred, now it's 90 feet from you.

01:22:45.195 --> 01:22:46.646
TALIESIN: Ten points of damage.

01:22:46.646 --> 01:22:49.884
TRAVIS: I'll do the same thing. I'll throw
some Eldritch Blast at it.

01:22:49.884 --> 01:22:50.650
MATT: Go for it.

01:22:50.650 --> 01:22:52.273
MARISHA: I'm still throwing rocks.

01:22:52.273 --> 01:22:53.463
SAM: I'll shoot an arrow.

01:22:53.464 --> 01:22:56.432
MATT: Yasha and Beau are moving rocks.
Make an athletics check for me.

01:22:56.432 --> 01:22:58.835
Make an athletics check for Yasha.
Yeah, she's good.

01:22:58.835 --> 01:22:59.694
MARISHA: Fuck. 11.

01:22:59.695 --> 01:23:01.506
TRAVIS: I'll move my Hex over onto it.

01:23:01.506 --> 01:23:02.253
SAM: 28.

01:23:02.253 --> 01:23:02.964
MATT: 28 hits.

01:23:02.964 --> 01:23:05.435
TALIESIN: I'm also going to throw
Sacred Flame at it.

01:23:05.435 --> 01:23:07.578
LAURA: It's not within range of Sacred Flame.

01:23:07.578 --> 01:23:09.211
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, it is 60 feet.

01:23:09.211 --> 01:23:11.592
MATT: It's not in range yet. It's 90 feet
from you.

01:23:11.593 --> 01:23:13.353
TRAVIS: 16 points of Eldritch damage.

01:23:13.353 --> 01:23:16.048
SAM: 12 points of bolt damage.

01:23:16.069 --> 01:23:17.448
LAURA: Guiding Bolt!

01:23:17.448 --> 01:23:19.200
MATT: Roll for attack.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:25.569
SAM: Oh no, it's getting closer. I back up
a little. Another five feet.

01:23:25.569 --> 01:23:29.231
MATT: All right, that's as far as you can get.
You're up against the wall now.

01:23:29.232 --> 01:23:32.277
LAURA: 13 points. Oh wait, I didn't roll
to attack. I'm an idiot.

01:23:32.277 --> 01:23:34.136
MATT: You have to roll attack for that.

01:23:34.137 --> 01:23:35.843
LAURA: Oh, that definitely hits.
19 plus eight.

01:23:35.843 --> 01:23:36.833
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

01:23:36.833 --> 01:23:38.282
LAURA: So that was 13 points.

01:23:38.282 --> 01:23:41.614
MATT: 13 points of radiant damage, and
it's also glowing. The next attack on it

01:23:41.615 --> 01:23:44.717
has advantage. It moves forward again.
It is now 70 feet from you.

01:23:44.717 --> 01:23:49.386
LIAM: I said Magic Missiles, but I don't have that
prepared, so I'm going to throw Fire Bolt at it.

01:23:49.386 --> 01:23:50.173
MATT: Go for it.

01:23:50.173 --> 01:23:51.147
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:23:51.147 --> 01:23:53.103
MARISHA: Kill it with cantrips.

01:23:53.103 --> 01:23:55.037
MATT: That's the way to do it.

01:23:55.037 --> 01:23:56.676
TRAVIS: One of those hits. 21.

01:23:56.676 --> 01:23:58.085
LIAM: 18 for me.

01:23:58.085 --> 01:23:59.850
MATT: 21 damage for you? 18 from you?

01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:01.233
TRAVIS: No, sorry, 21 to hit.

01:24:01.233 --> 01:24:02.905
MATT: 21 hits, yeah. And 18 damage.

01:24:02.906 --> 01:24:03.768
LIAM: 18 total.

01:24:03.768 --> 01:24:10.551
MATT: All right. It's taking hits and
slowly moving towards you. It feels like

01:24:10.551 --> 01:24:16.238
the old 1950s sci-fi movie with the weird
carrot looking creatures that these are

01:24:16.238 --> 01:24:20.892
loosely based on visually? This is like a
dude in a suit, trying to scoot it forward.

01:24:20.892 --> 01:24:24.560
They don't chase very well, ropers.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.998
SAM: I'm going to carefully aim and
fire a gun at it. My pistol.

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.044
MATT: Okay, go for it!

01:24:31.044 --> 01:24:33.859
TRAVIS: Before he fires, 19 points
of damage, four necrotic.

01:24:33.859 --> 01:24:35.291
MATT: You got it.

01:24:35.291 --> 01:24:37.248
LIAM: Say goodnight, Grimace.

01:24:37.249 --> 01:24:42.729
SAM: It is disadvantage because it's longer
than 30 feet away, right?

01:24:42.729 --> 01:24:46.152
MATT: But it's advantage because the--
well, no, because you already used

01:24:46.152 --> 01:24:47.631
the Guiding Bolt. That's right.

01:24:47.632 --> 01:24:53.187
SAM: So it would be not great. 13.

01:24:53.187 --> 01:25:00.167
MATT: There's a burst of powder and smoke.
You've never fired a firearm. It's still a

01:25:00.167 --> 01:25:04.458
relatively new technology for most people
outside of the main military, and even then,

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:08.617
they've only been producing them out of
Hupperdook for the past ten years. So your

01:25:08.617 --> 01:25:12.376
first time really using this, and yeah,
the ringing's in your ears, your hand

01:25:12.376 --> 01:25:20.426
feels numb from the blowback. Not great.
It (pings) off of the front of it.

01:25:20.426 --> 01:25:24.305
TRAVIS: I don't know what that is, but
I don't think you should use it no more.

01:25:24.305 --> 01:25:26.113
SAM: Reload!

01:25:26.415 --> 01:25:29.192
LAURA: Is it within 60 feet of us yet?

01:25:29.192 --> 01:25:32.089
TALIESIN: When do the insects get another
attack? Thank you.

01:25:32.089 --> 01:25:34.881
MATT: Now it's 60 feet.

01:25:34.881 --> 01:25:37.420
LAURA: Toll the Dead! Bong!

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.269
MATT: A natural 20 on its save.

01:25:39.269 --> 01:25:42.217
LIAM: Everybody's in a line, shaking their
heads at this thing.

01:25:42.217 --> 01:25:44.415
TRAVIS: Two more Eldritch Blasts.
Ooh, natural 20!

01:25:44.415 --> 01:25:47.441
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying. Oh, wait,
sorry. Sacred Flame.

01:25:47.441 --> 01:25:49.137
SAM: You're going to make it live?!

01:25:49.137 --> 01:25:50.194
MATT: That is a 15.

01:25:50.194 --> 01:25:51.101
TALIESIN: Nope, 16.

01:25:51.101 --> 01:25:52.198
MATT: Yep. Roll damage.

01:25:52.198 --> 01:25:53.318
TRAVIS: Natural 20 and a 20.

01:25:53.318 --> 01:25:57.534
MATT: Ooh! So both hits, one with a crit!
That first attack's a crit. Double.

01:26:00.344 --> 01:26:01.782
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage.

01:26:02.732 --> 01:26:06.989
LAURA: It's getting really close, so it's going
to be able to grapple us again very soon.

01:26:06.989 --> 01:26:08.425
MATT: Very next round.

01:26:08.425 --> 01:26:18.320
TRAVIS: 13 points of Eldritch Blast on the
first one, and 13 points on the second one.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:19.951
Man, that's so weird.

01:26:19.951 --> 01:26:22.894
MATT: Okay. Mighty Nein,
how do you want to do this?

01:26:23.688 --> 01:26:25.194
TALIESIN: With vague interest.

01:26:25.194 --> 01:26:29.501
MATT: With vague interest! It's starting
to loom forward (blasting).

01:26:29.501 --> 01:26:32.998
TRAVIS: No scoot! No! No!

01:26:32.999 --> 01:26:35.579
TALIESIN: Drop it!

01:26:35.579 --> 01:26:39.421
MATT: It goes limp. It gets really tense
for a second and then really sad, and is

01:26:39.421 --> 01:26:41.556
like, okay. It's dead.

01:26:41.556 --> 01:26:43.330
LAURA: Yay!

01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:47.770
TALIESIN: Now that that's done, I'm going to
start doing a ten minute heal for whoever.

01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:49.080
Who needs a heal?

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.605
LAURA: I need a heal!

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.864
SAM: You were eaten by it.

01:26:52.864 --> 01:26:56.036
TALIESIN: I'm going to start a ten minute
while you guys dig.

01:26:56.036 --> 01:26:58.515
TRAVIS: Yasha's pulling rocks.
Fjord's pulling rocks.

01:26:58.516 --> 01:27:00.607
LAURA: I think they were a couple, you guys.

01:27:00.607 --> 01:27:03.364
SAM: I think they were a couple.
I think they were married.

01:27:03.364 --> 01:27:07.786
LAURA: I think they've been living down here for
a long time. They were this wonderful couple.

01:27:07.786 --> 01:27:09.596
LIAM: Should we look for their babies?

01:27:09.596 --> 01:27:13.973
LAURA: (gasps) Little rock babies! Maybe that's
why they were mad. Maybe the crystals we took

01:27:13.973 --> 01:27:18.957
were their rock babies. What if it was their
giant baby nest, and we broke their babies out?

01:27:18.957 --> 01:27:20.479
LIAM: How's that tunnel coming?

01:27:20.479 --> 01:27:21.637
TRAVIS: Not fast enough.

01:27:21.638 --> 01:27:27.043
MATT: At this point in time, Beau and Yasha
have managed to pull enough rocks out of

01:27:27.043 --> 01:27:31.607
that tunnel to make it large enough for each
of you-- and Fjord-- to squeeze through.

01:27:31.607 --> 01:27:35.469
You can step through, each of you, and
eventually find yourself on the other side.

01:27:35.469 --> 01:27:39.466
The burrowed tunnel continues
ahead of you into darkness.

01:27:39.467 --> 01:27:43.177
TALIESIN: Who needs healing, by the way?
Okay, so just you two?

01:27:43.177 --> 01:27:45.471
LAURA: I think we're the only two that got hurt.

01:27:45.471 --> 01:27:46.745
LIAM: Need it a lot.

01:27:46.745 --> 01:27:48.077
SAM: Beau, did you get hurt?

01:27:48.077 --> 01:27:48.854
MARISHA: No.

01:27:48.854 --> 01:27:51.694
SAM: What are you doing over there?

01:27:51.694 --> 01:27:56.749
TALIESIN: 12 points of healing.

01:27:56.750 --> 01:28:00.631
LIAM: Did I mention I'm a monk?

01:28:00.631 --> 01:28:07.487
LAURA: Then I'm going to cast Cure Wounds
on myself as well at 2nd-level.

01:28:12.876 --> 01:28:18.592
SAM: Well, we only have about another two
weeks of walking before we get to Xhorhas.

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.042
LAURA: Yeah, no joke.

01:28:20.042 --> 01:28:24.785
SAM: Unless you make us a wagon with paint
and also horses.

01:28:24.785 --> 01:28:26.583
LIAM: And pavement.

01:28:26.583 --> 01:28:35.188
SAM: And pavement. What about bicycles?
You could paint eight bicycles.

01:28:35.188 --> 01:28:37.372
TRAVIS: Nobody knows what that is.

01:28:37.372 --> 01:28:39.967
SAM: It's a weird dream I had.

01:28:40.846 --> 01:28:45.939
MATT: Strange gnomish engineering that's
still in the early development stages.

01:28:45.939 --> 01:28:51.695
LAURA: I don't think there's anything that would
really help us down here that I could paint.

01:28:51.695 --> 01:28:58.379
SAM: Do one of you magic-y people have
some way of, next time we see a monster,

01:28:58.379 --> 01:29:02.775
instead of killing it, we could command it
to carry us, or something?

01:29:03.245 --> 01:29:07.014
TALIESIN: We could command it to carry us.
We could ask it politely to carry us.

01:29:07.014 --> 01:29:11.484
LAURA: Yeah, I actually do have the ability to
command things, but they have to be able to

01:29:11.484 --> 01:29:15.780
understand me, and I didn't think that those
rock things probably spoke our language.

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:18.203
TALIESIN: We never used the magic words,
to be fair.

01:29:18.203 --> 01:29:20.819
LAURA: Well, you know, we could have said
pretty please.

01:29:20.819 --> 01:29:23.055
TALIESIN: Please, thank you.
It gets you so far.

01:29:23.055 --> 01:29:24.869
LAURA: You don't know. I could try it.

01:29:24.872 --> 01:29:25.590
SAM: Next time.

01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:26.402
LAURA: Next time!

01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:30.014
SAM: On we go.

01:29:30.294 --> 01:29:38.522
MATT: Continuing down the familiar,
monotonous carved tunnel. If you're

01:29:38.522 --> 01:29:42.259
keeping the same order, make your perception
checks, keeping a watch out front.

01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:45.420
LIAM: Dancing Lights is up.

01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.728
LAURA: Ooh! 24.

01:29:49.728 --> 01:29:56.719
MATT: Nice. You move on for the remainder
of the day before getting to a point where

01:29:56.719 --> 01:30:01.809
you're starting to get a little tired, and you
figure you can continue to push on if you

01:30:01.809 --> 01:30:06.909
want to, but you'll begin to push into
possible exhaustion territory. You've now

01:30:06.909 --> 01:30:10.770
hit what would be a full day's worth of
travel, and this burrowed tunnel continues

01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:14.386
on. You've found one chamber and then
passed it, so at least you know there's

01:30:14.386 --> 01:30:18.623
probably more to come in the level you are
currently traveling in, but this day's

01:30:18.623 --> 01:30:22.070
travel, after that last encounter,
you have not found another chamber.

01:30:22.152 --> 01:30:26.413
MARISHA: I haven't seen any form of
writing, no offshoots, nothing like that?

01:30:26.413 --> 01:30:32.718
MATT: Nope. But the good news is as long as
you have this tunnel, you know

01:30:32.718 --> 01:30:34.370
at least you're probably on the right track.

01:30:35.042 --> 01:30:38.930
TALIESIN: If you want, I can Stone Shape.
I can push us in a--

01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:40.228
LIAM: We can do the same.

01:30:40.228 --> 01:30:45.951
TALIESIN: I'm going to carve a hole about
the size of what we need so we can be

01:30:45.951 --> 01:30:47.478
pressed into the wall.

01:30:47.478 --> 01:30:49.615
MATT: Okay. And the width of that is?

01:30:49.616 --> 01:30:53.139
LIAM: Oh, it's-- hold on a second.

01:30:53.185 --> 01:30:56.591
TALIESIN: It might be too big for me to carve.

01:30:56.939 --> 01:31:01.133
MATT: I think it might be a bit large to
carve the whole thing.

01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:04.029
LIAM: I can't remember. Almost there.
Ten-foot radius, yeah.

01:31:04.029 --> 01:31:08.689
MATT: Ten-foot radius, yeah. So you can carve part
of it, and it'll still be partially exposed, but

01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:12.615
he can color it as he wants, and with the
stone, it'll help somewhat camouflage it.

01:31:12.616 --> 01:31:15.149
LAURA: Yeah, nothing can get through it anyway.

01:31:15.149 --> 01:31:20.722
LIAM: We'll repeat everything, and I will
send Frumpkin up ahead of us 50 feet

01:31:20.722 --> 01:31:25.084
to stay up all night, as a guard to come
running back in if need be.

01:31:25.084 --> 01:31:27.741
MATT: So you guys spend the evening.
Another long rest.

01:31:27.741 --> 01:31:30.743
Roll perception for Frumpkin for the evening,
if you don't mind.

01:31:30.743 --> 01:31:32.311
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.

01:31:32.311 --> 01:31:33.041
MATT: Okay.

01:31:33.055 --> 01:31:40.896
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending for Yeza.
I'm going to say: It's me again. Can you

01:31:40.897 --> 01:31:49.701
let us know if you've been on the move,
or if you're staying in the same place?

01:31:49.701 --> 01:31:51.573
SAM: Out of the tunnels?

01:31:53.673 --> 01:31:56.245
LAURA: Are you in the tunnels still?

01:31:56.543 --> 01:31:58.984
TRAVIS: Are you in the tunnels?

01:31:59.402 --> 01:32:12.032
MATT: There's a brief pause and then, "Ah.
No, they just have me in a room. We haven't

01:32:12.032 --> 01:32:20.283
been traveling underground since we got out,
but they have me in the city now."

01:32:20.283 --> 01:32:21.416
LAURA: (whispers) Shit.

01:32:21.417 --> 01:32:24.908
SAM: Why'd you say "shit"? What's going on?

01:32:26.418 --> 01:32:31.797
LAURA: He's already in the city. We're not
going to be able to ambush them, you guys.

01:32:35.335 --> 01:32:39.429
SAM: Okay, well, we'll come up with
another plan. You guys are smart.

01:32:39.704 --> 01:32:42.910
TRAVIS: Yeah, and there wasn't much of an
ambush we could do anyway.

01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:45.615
It's one way in, one way out. We'll be fine.

01:32:45.751 --> 01:32:48.221
MARISHA: It's more information, which is
always good.

01:32:51.073 --> 01:32:52.002
LAURA: Yeah.

01:32:54.375 --> 01:32:58.114
SAM: Let's go to sleep so we can start early
in the morning.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:32:59.559
MATT: Perception for Frumpkin?

01:32:59.559 --> 01:33:00.637
LIAM: 17 for Frumpkin.

01:33:00.644 --> 01:33:08.168
MATT: Good to know. The evening goes by. Frumpkin
does notice throughout the evening some movement

01:33:08.168 --> 01:33:17.683
through the tunnel: a strange creature, similar to
what seemed to be the stalagmite-type roper

01:33:17.683 --> 01:33:23.777
creatures who you had fought before, but a little
smaller, scooting along the ceiling. It made it

01:33:23.777 --> 01:33:30.938
through the tunnel, over top of you guys, and then
continued on without noticing or caring about the

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:40.936
location where you had placed and camouflaged your
evening's rest. The next morning comes to.

01:33:40.937 --> 01:33:47.424
You continue traveling? All right. Keeping a
watch out, Laura, please, as Jester, roll your

01:33:47.424 --> 01:33:53.823
perception check. It's a long subterranean journey
for me doing day-to-day here. I'm sorry.

01:33:55.193 --> 01:33:56.469
TALIESIN: Oof.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.815
SAM: Barf.

01:33:58.615 --> 01:34:00.472
LAURA: That's a bad one. Eight.

01:34:00.562 --> 01:34:04.130
MATT: Okay. You got a keen eye out there
in front of you.

01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:08.807
LAURA: Sorry, guys. I rolled really well
yesterday, though.

01:34:08.807 --> 01:34:15.799
MATT: This day is the hardest so far, because
it is an entire eight-plus hours of just

01:34:15.799 --> 01:34:23.751
winding tunnel. Once again, that continuous
pace. It seems to dip at times and then

01:34:23.751 --> 01:34:33.228
it picks up. It has its own organic shifting
to it in small bits, but it is a day of travel

01:34:33.228 --> 01:34:38.270
of that same ten-foot wide, continuous
tunnel, and it is maddening.

01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:43.465
LAURA: (singing) 66 bottles of beer on the wall,
66 bottles of beer.

01:34:43.465 --> 01:34:50.480
ALL: (singing) Take one down, pass it around,
65 bottles of beer on the wall.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.264
LAURA: (strained singing) 21 bottles of beer
on the wall--

01:34:55.264 --> 01:34:59.983
LIAM: Also, all throughout the day, once
an hour, Caleb says: It's 2:00.

01:34:59.983 --> 01:35:01.005
SAM: Shut up.

01:35:01.635 --> 01:35:03.128
LIAM: An hour goes by--

01:35:03.128 --> 01:35:04.367
MATT: Perfect.

01:35:05.377 --> 01:35:06.345
LIAM: It's 3:00.

01:35:06.345 --> 01:35:07.047
SAM: No.

01:35:07.047 --> 01:35:10.805
TRAVIS: You know, if you're going to do those,
maybe put some chimes behind them

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:12.487
so you can be like a bell tower.

01:35:12.487 --> 01:35:16.462
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy every time he says it
to make the bing-bong noise.

01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:21.356
LIAM: An hour later: Ding-dong ding-dong.
It's 4:00.

01:35:23.506 --> 01:35:30.874
MATT: All right. That day's travel goes by
uneventful. So day three is done,

01:35:30.874 --> 01:35:33.358
do you guys set up camp once more
here in the tunnel?

01:35:33.358 --> 01:35:36.963
LAURA: Same deal? I'm going to send
a message to Yeza.

01:35:37.354 --> 01:35:38.347
MATT: Okay.

01:35:40.388 --> 01:35:41.680
LAURA: S'me again.

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:45.681
TRAVIS: Is "s'me" one word? "s" apostrophe
m-e? Okay.

01:35:46.196 --> 01:35:47.549
MATT: I think so.

01:35:48.073 --> 01:35:53.597
LAURA: How long were you in these tunnels?
Do you know? How do you feel?

01:35:54.807 --> 01:36:03.398
We're on the way. Your wife misses you
a lot. She loves you.

01:36:03.717 --> 01:36:04.889
TRAVIS: She loves.

01:36:05.643 --> 01:36:10.356
LAURA: Shit. I thought that meant I used
two, I had three left. Shit. She loves.

01:36:11.866 --> 01:36:13.152
MATT: She loves a lot.

01:36:13.277 --> 01:36:14.927
TRAVIS: I'm roughly counting, so I don't know.

01:36:16.915 --> 01:36:18.766
MATT: All you hear is, "I can't."

01:36:19.811 --> 01:36:20.777
LAURA: Oh no!

01:36:21.039 --> 01:36:24.568
SAM: What is that? What's the "oh no"?
What is that? That's even worse than

01:36:24.568 --> 01:36:25.886
"oh shit." What is that?

01:36:27.038 --> 01:36:31.374
LAURA: I just think somebody was-- he wasn't alone
this time and he couldn't respond is all.

01:36:31.374 --> 01:36:32.473
SAM: Is he okay?

01:36:32.473 --> 01:36:35.901
LAURA: Yeah! He just said "I can't" so
I was like "Oh! Okay." That's all.

01:36:35.901 --> 01:36:38.184
SAM: Like I can't breathe? I can't live anymore?

01:36:38.184 --> 01:36:42.747
LAURA: No like, I can't talk to you he basically
said, "I can't talk to you right now, I'm busy."

01:36:42.747 --> 01:36:46.833
TALIESIN: I can't eat this, I can't floss,
there's all sorts of things people can't do.

01:36:46.833 --> 01:36:49.019
LAURA: I think he was in the middle of dinner.

01:36:49.019 --> 01:36:52.113
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I can't do all sorts
of things when I'm eating.

01:36:52.123 --> 01:36:57.176
LAURA: Yeah. It'll be okay, Nott.
It'll be okay.

01:36:57.176 --> 01:37:00.028
SAM: Yes, I know. We'll find him.

01:37:00.193 --> 01:37:07.212
TRAVIS: Nott, I have to say I've been feeling
pretty bad hearing that you drowned previously.

01:37:07.212 --> 01:37:14.954
I want to apologize for making you face your fear
over and over again. No, I've been giving you some

01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:22.294
shit, and as someone who has experienced the
same thing, I commend you for your bravery.

01:37:22.294 --> 01:37:25.122
SAM: You've experienced the same thing;
you've drowned?

01:37:25.122 --> 01:37:26.184
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:37:26.184 --> 01:37:28.271
SAM: Oh, that's right.

01:37:29.801 --> 01:37:32.470
TRAVIS: That's cool, don't worry about it. Yeah.

01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:34.775
SAM: Well, you didn't know.
How would you have known?

01:37:37.196 --> 01:37:40.532
TRAVIS: No, but thank you all the same.

01:37:42.372 --> 01:37:47.412
LIAM: You took a lot of courage to go in. I was
not very helpful in that regard either. You did

01:37:47.412 --> 01:37:54.766
not tell us what was going on. Why would you?
You still went in for a long time. So, sorry.

01:37:55.536 --> 01:38:06.635
SAM: No, it's all right. I'm sorry that I wasn't
more helpful in that earlier fight when I panicked

01:38:06.635 --> 01:38:16.633
and didn't go in the water. But it's not so bad if
you're down in the water with your friends.

01:38:19.194 --> 01:38:21.922
LIAM: Oh! It's nine o'clock.

01:38:22.212 --> 01:38:23.674
SAM: Fuck you!

01:38:23.674 --> 01:38:30.144
(laughter)

01:38:30.144 --> 01:38:32.201
SAM: Your people did this to me!

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:41.021
(laughter)

01:38:43.201 --> 01:38:46.612
MATT: So you settle in for your third evening
here underground.

01:38:46.719 --> 01:38:48.680
LAURA: I'm going to use a spell!

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.480
SAM: I assume they've been making food for us
and stuff?

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.070
LAURA: Yeah!

01:38:53.071 --> 01:38:56.250
MATT: I would hope so, because your provisions
are going to run out pretty quickly otherwise.

01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:58.984
LAURA: Sure, we've been making food.

01:38:58.984 --> 01:39:01.511
TALIESIN: Yeah, I had that spell set up. Sure.

01:39:02.781 --> 01:39:08.022
MATT: Divine mac and cheese. Doesn't taste divine,
just is divine.

01:39:08.212 --> 01:39:12.428
LAURA: I can't do the spell I was going to do
because I forgot I didn't have it prepared,

01:39:12.428 --> 01:39:13.964
but maybe tomorrow!

01:39:13.964 --> 01:39:19.365
MATT: Maybe tomorrow. So same set up?
Evening's rest, Frumpkin's keeping watch.

01:39:19.365 --> 01:39:21.653
Go ahead and roll perception check
for Frumpkin.

01:39:24.823 --> 01:39:25.829
LIAM: Ah, six.

01:39:25.829 --> 01:39:27.309
MATT: Six, okay good to know.

01:39:27.309 --> 01:39:29.110
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking balls.

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:35.987
MATT: As the evening goes on...
Frumpkin doesn't notice anything.

01:39:37.287 --> 01:39:38.435
LIAM: Good cat.

01:39:38.895 --> 01:39:47.234
MATT: You wake up. Your fourth day begins.
You gather your things and begin to trek

01:39:47.234 --> 01:39:51.051
even further into this single,
perpetual, tunnel.

01:39:51.051 --> 01:40:01.006
MARISHA: Hey guys. I'm just saying, if we're going
to be underground in a blank, boring, shit-hole

01:40:01.006 --> 01:40:07.525
tunnel for a whole 'nother day, I still have some
of these mushrooms left over from Mollymauk.

01:40:08.545 --> 01:40:10.315
SAM: It would pass the time.

01:40:10.315 --> 01:40:12.521
MARISHA: Might just help make it fun.

01:40:12.521 --> 01:40:14.844
TRAVIS: Wow, really? Now?

01:40:14.844 --> 01:40:16.061
MARISHA: I'm real bored.

01:40:16.062 --> 01:40:20.775
TRAVIS: It's super dark. Lives could be at
jeopardy at any moment, and you want to trip?

01:40:20.775 --> 01:40:26.919
LAURA: Yeah, it's true. If those cone-head
thingys come out again, I don't want

01:40:26.919 --> 01:40:30.053
any of you not being aware of what's happening.

01:40:31.073 --> 01:40:32.385
MARISHA: I'm just so bored.

01:40:32.385 --> 01:40:33.476
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:40:33.476 --> 01:40:34.770
LIAM: You're bored?

01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:35.508
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:40:35.508 --> 01:40:42.291
LIAM: Really? Look at this. Frumpkin gets
up onto his hind legs and does a little--

01:40:42.291 --> 01:40:44.789
(laughter)

01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:49.694
LAURA: Oh, Beau! You know what we could do?
Here, take this. I'm going to give her the

01:40:49.694 --> 01:40:52.512
smutty book that you gave me just recently.

01:40:52.512 --> 01:40:54.216
MARISHA: (gasps)

01:40:54.216 --> 01:40:56.704
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait! Read it out loud!

01:40:56.705 --> 01:40:58.282
MARISHA: Okay!

01:40:58.282 --> 01:41:00.988
TRAVIS: Why do you do these things?

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:03.905
LAURA: Now we can all have entertainment
while we're walking!

01:41:03.905 --> 01:41:07.002
SAM: It's like listening to a podcast
when you're driving to work.

01:41:07.002 --> 01:41:11.372
MARISHA: It already starts good, you guys.
It was a glistening night--

01:41:11.372 --> 01:41:13.186
TRAVIS: Oh, crap. No.

01:41:13.187 --> 01:41:16.806
MARISHA: The snow fell on the winding paths.

01:41:16.806 --> 01:41:18.875
SAM: Oh, just like the path we're on!

01:41:18.875 --> 01:41:23.287
MARISHA: It was chilly. She could feel her
nipples getting hard.

01:41:23.287 --> 01:41:26.122
It starts so soon, it starts so soon!

01:41:26.122 --> 01:41:29.778
LAURA: I mean, normally it doesn't take, but--

01:41:29.778 --> 01:41:31.896
TALIESIN: That was going right into it.

01:41:31.897 --> 01:41:33.529
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw!

01:41:33.529 --> 01:41:36.718
MATT: This is just an overall penalty to stealth.

01:41:36.718 --> 01:41:40.382
(laughter)

01:41:40.382 --> 01:41:44.076
TRAVIS: Is there anything on the ceiling as I
awkwardly stare up at it?

01:41:44.076 --> 01:41:47.388
MATT: Both you and Jester both make
perception checks.

01:41:47.388 --> 01:41:49.242
TRAVIS: Oh, I was kidding, but--

01:41:49.242 --> 01:41:55.744
MARISHA: She felt the warmth of a fire. She could
feel his warm touch as it was grasping around--

01:41:55.744 --> 01:41:59.253
SAM: Around what? Around her waist? Around
her buttocks? What?

01:41:59.253 --> 01:42:00.366
TRAVIS: 17.

01:42:00.366 --> 01:42:06.278
MARISHA: As his strong, burly, hairy arms
wrapped around her waist, she could feel

01:42:06.278 --> 01:42:10.368
her breath leaving her bodice.
This is so good, Jester!

01:42:10.368 --> 01:42:11.931
LAURA: I know! Thank you, Caleb.

01:42:11.931 --> 01:42:12.790
MATT: Travis.

01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:13.564
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:42:13.564 --> 01:42:20.079
MATT: Fjord, at this point, trying to ignore that
and facing forward, is continuing. The path, this

01:42:20.079 --> 01:42:27.747
protracted tunnel, you begin to notice smaller
tunnels intersecting with it.

01:42:27.747 --> 01:42:29.503
TRAVIS: Like on the sides, or--?

01:42:29.504 --> 01:42:32.609
MATT: Like one on the side, one a little higher.

01:42:32.609 --> 01:42:34.344
TRAVIS: Up in front of us?

01:42:34.344 --> 01:42:38.474
SAM: While I'm listening to Beau, I'm
going to fold my arms so no one can

01:42:38.474 --> 01:42:40.837
see the shape of my nipples right now.

01:42:40.837 --> 01:42:44.162
(laughter)

01:42:44.162 --> 01:42:45.123
MATT: All right.

01:42:45.123 --> 01:42:48.807
LIAM: You know, you are a very good reader.
You give it a lot of character.

01:42:48.997 --> 01:42:53.163
MARISHA: (stuttering) Thanks.
As she reached down--

01:42:53.163 --> 01:42:59.944
TRAVIS: Man, I hate to interrupt, but you know,
we have some divergent pathways ahead.

01:42:59.944 --> 01:43:02.179
TALIESIN: How big are they?

01:43:02.179 --> 01:43:07.849
MATT: You look up and you can see. They are maybe
about two, three feet wide each. From what you can

01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:15.918
see, the entrance to the first one on the right
that's on the right side, a lot of dirt and rock

01:43:15.919 --> 01:43:22.298
has been pushed into it. It's kind of closed off.
You walk up to the second one. It's a little more

01:43:22.298 --> 01:43:28.880
up on the left, higher range of it, and you can
see there are bits of stone and dirt that have

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:32.306
fallen out and created a small pile
on the ground beneath it.

01:43:33.116 --> 01:43:34.673
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:43:34.673 --> 01:43:38.094
LIAM: Do they bear any resemblance
to the giant hole that we were following?

01:43:38.094 --> 01:43:39.672
MATT: No.

01:43:39.673 --> 01:43:44.025
TRAVIS: Hey, you want to send that cat
of yours about 50 feet behind us?

01:43:44.025 --> 01:43:45.285
LIAM: Oh, behind us?

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:48.101
LAURA: Do we hear anything coming from
the tunnels?

01:43:48.101 --> 01:43:52.157
MATT: You, who have been so distracted by the
reading of the book, hear nothing.

01:43:52.157 --> 01:43:54.798
TRAVIS: It looks like two of those had
stuff pushed into it.

01:43:54.799 --> 01:43:56.691
That one looks like something came out of it.

01:43:56.691 --> 01:44:01.660
TALIESIN: Wouldn't maybe if you were traveling
these caves, you would've capped them because of

01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:04.299
things that kept popping out of the wall?

01:44:04.299 --> 01:44:10.066
MATT: Caleb, looking at this, you figure these
tunnels existed before this burrowing happened,

01:44:10.066 --> 01:44:14.706
and it looks like when this worm came through,
it tore through whatever these tunnels were

01:44:14.706 --> 01:44:20.613
and pushed shit into them and wrecked
a little bit of this tunnel structure.

01:44:20.613 --> 01:44:23.435
TRAVIS: That one came into this one, though.
After the big guy came through.

01:44:23.935 --> 01:44:24.923
TALIESIN: What?

01:44:25.103 --> 01:44:30.115
MARISHA: That's funny, that was exactly
what was about to happen. I'm sorry, what?

01:44:30.876 --> 01:44:34.940
I'm going to-- I bookmarked it.

01:44:37.901 --> 01:44:40.640
TRAVIS: Caduceus, go look up front!
Jesus, god.

01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:42.831
SAM: He can't see in the dark.

01:44:42.831 --> 01:44:46.939
TALIESIN: I've got a light. Does it look like
these were-- I'm going to go up to one

01:44:46.939 --> 01:44:50.798
and examine it. Do I hear anything? Do I see
any scrapings that would give a sign?

01:44:50.798 --> 01:44:52.440
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:57.532
TALIESIN: It's 15.

01:44:57.532 --> 01:45:07.246
MATT: Listening in, looking up there,
you don't see anything-- the one to the right,

01:45:07.246 --> 01:45:09.903
you don't see anything,
you don't hear anything.

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:12.280
TALIESIN: These markings on the interior--

01:45:12.281 --> 01:45:19.458
MATT: You do notice some markings,
quick little cuts in the dirt or stone,

01:45:19.458 --> 01:45:23.604
like hand or claw marks dragged
across bits of it. Small.

01:45:23.604 --> 01:45:25.213
TALIESIN: Something burrowed.

01:45:25.213 --> 01:45:29.934
MATT: You see the pile of rocks and dirt that have
fallen along the top. You glance over and you can

01:45:29.934 --> 01:45:34.588
see something somewhat shiny that's
picking up the light from your globe.

01:45:34.588 --> 01:45:38.460
TALIESIN: I'm going to clean it off a bit.

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:50.243
MATT: It looks like a hammer, but it's not well
taken care of, per se. Your nose picks up a little

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:56.037
bit of the air here; it smells somewhat rancid,
a little bit. Just a faint hint of rot.

01:45:56.037 --> 01:46:01.686
TRAVIS: Anything behind us?

01:46:01.687 --> 01:46:04.649
TALIESIN: I'm worried about the things around us.

01:46:04.649 --> 01:46:07.663
LIAM: How high off of the ground is that hole?

01:46:07.663 --> 01:46:13.988
MATT: It's about ten feet up. The whole
tunnel is one big ten-foot side to side.

01:46:13.988 --> 01:46:17.320
TALIESIN: I'm going to clear away a little bit
more. Is there a body underneath this pile?

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.229
MATT: No body.

01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:19.372
TALIESIN: Just a hammer?

01:46:19.372 --> 01:46:21.269
MATT: Yeah, just like a discarded tool.

01:46:21.489 --> 01:46:23.453
TALIESIN: I'll take a look at the hammer.

01:46:23.453 --> 01:46:28.712
MATT: It's a hammer. It looks like it's
seen a lot of use.

01:46:28.712 --> 01:46:30.140
TRAVIS: Why? Why a hammer?

01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:36.338
MATT: The metal's wrecked a little bit in places
and it's been bludgeoned and misused.

01:46:36.339 --> 01:46:38.374
TALIESIN: I think someone got grabbed.

01:46:38.374 --> 01:46:44.593
SAM: Are the rocks around here dug out,
like someone was digging?

01:46:44.593 --> 01:46:47.778
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:46:47.778 --> 01:46:51.353
SAM: 28.

01:46:51.353 --> 01:46:57.561
MATT: They have been dug, and you see
signs that they were dug out by hand

01:46:57.562 --> 01:47:01.614
and dug out by shovel, or some sort
of a tool used for digging.

01:47:01.614 --> 01:47:03.419
SAM: From above, or from--?

01:47:03.419 --> 01:47:08.281
MATT: From above and the side. You get the sense
that the one that opens up here connected to the

01:47:08.281 --> 01:47:13.574
other one, and this tunnel was burrowed in the
middle and took out that connecting point.

01:47:13.574 --> 01:47:15.152
TALIESIN: I've got a crazy idea.

01:47:15.152 --> 01:47:19.112
TRAVIS: What, that we can be under the Ashkeeper
Peaks and these are mining tunnels?

01:47:19.112 --> 01:47:22.715
TALIESIN: Well, no-- that's great.
That's way better.

01:47:24.145 --> 01:47:25.952
SAM: He just wanted to play Parcheesi.

01:47:27.562 --> 01:47:29.484
LAURA: What were you thinking, Caduceus?

01:47:29.484 --> 01:47:35.396
TALIESIN: I think that this was some sort
of pathway and maybe this closed-off

01:47:35.396 --> 01:47:42.652
pathway here is possibly the way to go,
I don't know. I feel like we might have

01:47:42.652 --> 01:47:45.855
found a way of sneaking into
where we're going.

01:47:47.126 --> 01:47:48.136
SAM: Sneaking in?

01:47:48.136 --> 01:47:54.792
MARISHA: Is there any remnants of precious
metals, coals, things that would be mined?

01:47:55.922 --> 01:48:00.193
MATT: Looking around here, most of it
appears to be carved stone and dirt.

01:48:00.193 --> 01:48:04.592
TALIESIN: If anyone doesn't mind, I'm going to
pull out my shovel and start working on this.

01:48:04.593 --> 01:48:08.455
TRAVIS: I think we're dead under this
mountain-peak, right? (counting)

01:48:08.455 --> 01:48:09.308
We're like (taps).

01:48:09.308 --> 01:48:10.830
MARISHA: We've got to be, right?

01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:13.454
TALIESIN: This blocked off path that this
got bisected--

01:48:13.454 --> 01:48:16.169
SAM: So we could go up to get out
if we wanted to get out.

01:48:16.169 --> 01:48:20.419
TALIESIN: Or we could go down this way, because I
don't think there's that much dirt in this--

01:48:20.419 --> 01:48:23.179
MATT: Well, the tunnel continues also.
It's up to you guys.

01:48:23.179 --> 01:48:25.685
LIAM: We can bail if we wanted to, perhaps.

01:48:25.685 --> 01:48:30.886
MARISHA: Would I know the exact boundary
line of Xhorhas between the Empire?

01:48:30.886 --> 01:48:33.103
Do they use the mountains?

01:48:33.103 --> 01:48:37.701
MATT: The Ashkeeper Peaks are what divides the two
sides of eastern and western Wynandir, yeah.

01:48:37.701 --> 01:48:42.362
TRAVIS: Might as well see where this thing goes.
We can keep going if we have to.

01:48:42.362 --> 01:48:46.792
SAM: We can go see the sun for a couple of hours,
get some vitamin D, and then come back down.

01:48:46.793 --> 01:48:51.222
MARISHA: If we're under the mountains, it could be
a long way up, and we don't know what those

01:48:51.222 --> 01:48:57.517
mountains look like. I mean, I don't know, it also
could be fall and temperate and beautiful.

01:48:57.517 --> 01:49:00.201
TRAVIS: There could be pigeons on the
mountaintop.

01:49:00.201 --> 01:49:02.298
SAM: Edible pigeons?

01:49:02.298 --> 01:49:04.448
TRAVIS: Is there another kind?

01:49:04.448 --> 01:49:06.036
SAM: No.

01:49:06.036 --> 01:49:10.864
LAURA: I read scary books when I was little about
these creatures that lived in the mountains that

01:49:10.864 --> 01:49:15.431
were see-through because they lived underground
for so long, but they had really long claws and

01:49:15.431 --> 01:49:18.360
they would snatch up babies.

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.270
TRAVIS: Not helping.

01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:22.608
LAURA: I'm just saying maybe we should
avoid them.

01:49:22.608 --> 01:49:26.697
TALIESIN: I'm going to start prodding to see
how deep this cap on this bottom one goes.

01:49:26.697 --> 01:49:31.215
MATT: It's a couple of feet deep, and the rest of
the tunnel goes beyond, but for you, Caduceus,

01:49:31.215 --> 01:49:34.970
it's a tight squeeze. We're talking Bishop in
Aliens getting through the tunnel.

01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:38.529
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look in there.
Do I feel any wind, anything--?

01:49:38.529 --> 01:49:39.281
MATT: No.

01:49:39.281 --> 01:49:40.895
TALIESIN: It's just stagnant air?

01:49:40.895 --> 01:49:43.170
MATT: Yeah. There's no breeze in here, no.

01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:49.951
SAM: If we go topside, what are the
possible benefits of doing that?

01:49:49.951 --> 01:49:54.931
LIAM: Well, not going to Xhorhas and
getting murdered by far greater forces--

01:49:54.931 --> 01:49:56.339
SAM: We're going to Xhorhas.

01:49:56.339 --> 01:49:58.436
LIAM: -- but I think we're going to Xhorhas.

01:49:58.436 --> 01:50:02.968
SAM: We could go up and maybe find a horse or
something and coax it down here to take us faster.

01:50:02.968 --> 01:50:05.113
TALIESIN: A horse on the top of the mountain?

01:50:05.113 --> 01:50:09.771
SAM: I don't know, if this miner fellow who was
eaten alive left a couple of horses tied up there--

01:50:09.771 --> 01:50:12.430
TALIESIN: Why would he leave horses
on top of a mountain?

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:16.439
SAM: Why would you bring them into the mountain?
You would leave them tied up on top.

01:50:16.439 --> 01:50:20.284
LAURA: What if it's not a miner from the top?
What if it's one of the creatures that

01:50:20.284 --> 01:50:23.438
I was talking about and this is his hammer
and the tunnel actually--

01:50:23.438 --> 01:50:24.529
SAM: The worm's hammer?

01:50:24.529 --> 01:50:28.435
LAURA: No, what if it's a creature that
lives in the mountain and he's got a hammer

01:50:28.435 --> 01:50:32.617
and one of these tunnels leads to his village
under the mountain and it's a whole village

01:50:32.617 --> 01:50:35.287
of scary people that's going to
attack us as soon as we--

01:50:35.287 --> 01:50:39.128
SAM: Caduceus, cast Talk to Objects.
Ask the hammer.

01:50:39.129 --> 01:50:42.029
TALIESIN: What would you like me
to ask the hammer?

01:50:42.029 --> 01:50:44.105
SAM: Who was your owner?

01:50:44.105 --> 01:50:45.692
LIAM: There is really only one reason
to use the side tunnels.

01:50:45.692 --> 01:50:47.068
TALIESIN: Who was your owner?

01:50:47.068 --> 01:50:48.199
LIAM: To leave.

01:50:48.199 --> 01:50:51.829
LAURA: (whispering) To go poop, because
there's not really a lot of privacy--

01:50:51.829 --> 01:50:53.300
LIAM: You can do that anywhere.

01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:57.441
TALIESIN: The hammer is very obstinate, but
I would imagine that's expected of a hammer.

01:50:57.442 --> 01:51:01.015
I'm not going to say it wasn't worth a try.
I would have been surprised, but

01:51:01.015 --> 01:51:02.730
I would have been delighted as well.

01:51:02.730 --> 01:51:06.579
TRAVIS: Do we have any real positives for
going up? I honestly can't think of any.

01:51:06.579 --> 01:51:10.202
LIAM: Only if we wanted to give up, which
we are not doing, so we go forward.

01:51:10.202 --> 01:51:15.614
MARISHA: (laughs) Okay, here's the other thing,
though-- sorry, I'm dying at the hammer.

01:51:15.615 --> 01:51:23.208
This is, arguably, going to lead to a nexus,
right? Like an entry point?

01:51:23.588 --> 01:51:24.607
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:51:25.327 --> 01:51:31.793
MARISHA: So what's on the other si-- Did they
build a military base around the entrance

01:51:31.793 --> 01:51:34.936
to this tunnel system and is that
what we're about to walk into?

01:51:34.936 --> 01:51:36.030
SAM: If we go up?

01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:41.865
MARISHA: If we go forward. If we keep
following this, is it going to lead us--

01:51:41.865 --> 01:51:44.455
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: There's no way to know.

01:51:44.455 --> 01:51:47.740
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I know. I was just
kind of throwing it out there.

01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:49.498
TRAVIS: How far can Frumpkin go?

01:51:49.498 --> 01:51:53.837
TALIESIN: Actually, that's a good idea. Can we
send Frumpkin down one of these tiny tunnels?

01:51:53.837 --> 01:51:59.608
LIAM: Quite a ways, but if he gets too far away, I
no longer have the ability to communicate with him.

01:51:59.608 --> 01:52:01.613
TRAVIS: How about just to that edge, then?

01:52:03.953 --> 01:52:05.070
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, okay.

01:52:05.070 --> 01:52:06.203
TALIESIN: Cool.

01:52:06.203 --> 01:52:07.777
MATT: So you send Frumpkin ahead?

01:52:07.777 --> 01:52:08.708
LIAM: Sure.

01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:13.909
MATT: Roll a perception check for Frumpkin. In the
dark, so disadvantage on the perception check.

01:52:14.089 --> 01:52:17.354
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, but advantage with smell
if there's anything stinky.

01:52:17.354 --> 01:52:18.851
MATT: Okay, good to know.

01:52:18.851 --> 01:52:22.456
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea.

01:52:22.456 --> 01:52:24.087
MATT: What's your idea?

01:52:24.088 --> 01:52:30.140
LAURA: What if I cast Daylight? We could tie a
ribbon around Frumpkin's neck, I cast Daylight

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:33.978
on his neck, on the ribbon, and then
he can see wherever he goes.

01:52:33.978 --> 01:52:37.787
TALIESIN: I can cast Light on the ribbon,
too, so you don't have to burn a spell.

01:52:37.787 --> 01:52:39.516
LAURA: Hey, that's better than that.

01:52:39.516 --> 01:52:43.578
TALIESIN: I cast Light on something
tied to Frumpkin.

01:52:43.578 --> 01:52:47.010
LAURA: I take a ribbon off my horn
and wrap it around Frumpkin's neck.

01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:48.640
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:53.389
LIAM: Put the ribbon on the backside
so it's not right in his eyes.

01:52:53.389 --> 01:52:58.814
MATT: You tie a little ribbon around Frumpkin's
neck, you cast Light, and now the ribbon gives off

01:52:58.814 --> 01:53:01.623
this torchlight glow from the back of Frumpkin.

01:53:01.623 --> 01:53:04.228
LIAM: For the first ten seconds, Frumpkin goes--

01:53:04.228 --> 01:53:08.078
(laughter)

01:53:08.078 --> 01:53:09.301
TRAVIS: Get it off!

01:53:09.821 --> 01:53:13.571
LIAM: But gets used to it, and then trots off.

01:53:13.571 --> 01:53:16.628
MATT: Now roll a straight perception roll
for Frumpkin.

01:53:16.628 --> 01:53:19.598
LIAM: I did, I rolled twice, so it's a 16
perception.

01:53:19.598 --> 01:53:31.109
MATT: 16, okay. Frumpkin continues on 50 feet, 80
feet. About another hundred feet or so, there's

01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:40.715
another tunnel intersection; it's breached by this
carving path. Then, about another 130 feet or so,

01:53:40.715 --> 01:53:49.346
another chamber opens up. This chamber is about 40
foot by 80 foot and the smell here is strong,

01:53:49.347 --> 01:53:59.979
Frumpkin picks up on. It smells of rot, mildew,
feces. It's not a pleasant smell, and there are

01:53:59.979 --> 01:54:14.851
piles of refuse and furs and utensils and belts
and odd objects that are thrown into piles here.

01:54:14.852 --> 01:54:19.839
You can see a number of other tunnels that all
intersect into this area.

01:54:19.839 --> 01:54:23.970
LIAM: Is there any immediate reaction to a glowing
cat entering into this big chamber?

01:54:23.970 --> 01:54:24.856
MATT: Nope.

01:54:25.236 --> 01:54:29.065
TALIESIN: Maybe roll back and try
one of these smaller tunnels also,

01:54:29.065 --> 01:54:33.549
just to see what's a few feet down, maybe?

01:54:33.549 --> 01:54:36.022
LIAM: I can't hear anybody.

01:54:36.022 --> 01:54:38.777
TALIESIN: I mean, it seems like the thing to do.

01:54:38.777 --> 01:54:39.967
TRAVIS: He can't hear us.

01:54:39.968 --> 01:54:41.019
TALIESIN: What?

01:54:41.489 --> 01:54:42.625
LAURA: Oh, Caduceus.

01:54:42.625 --> 01:54:43.374
TALIESIN: Yeah?

01:54:43.374 --> 01:54:45.848
LAURA: He can't hear us when he's
doing these things.

01:54:45.848 --> 01:54:46.690
TALIESIN: Really?

01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:49.166
LIAM: How many chambers are--
Is it just many, many--

01:54:49.166 --> 01:54:54.453
MATT: Ten or so different tunnels lead
into this chamber, all ranging between

01:54:54.453 --> 01:54:56.528
two feet wide to about three feet wide.

01:54:56.528 --> 01:55:01.059
LIAM: I'm just watching. I can no longer send
commands, I can only go along for the ride

01:55:01.059 --> 01:55:05.180
to watch. Am I seeing anything like
mining equipment?

01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:16.975
MATT: You see a small broken shovel. There are
piles of dirt, bones, coins. Looks like a lot of

01:55:16.975 --> 01:55:23.423
things that have been gathered. You can see
warped pieces of wood that are partially

01:55:23.424 --> 01:55:32.509
whittled and then abandoned in the moment.
Stacks of a bunch of junk.

01:55:37.639 --> 01:55:38.400
LIAM: Okay.

01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:45.520
MATT: Frumpkin hears a small growl and looks,
and in the far-right corner, there's a small cage.

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:51.399
In the cage, there's some sort of a furred
creature, no more than that big or so,

01:55:51.399 --> 01:55:57.198
that's missing tufts of fur, and it's
in the cage going (growling).

01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:01.272
LIAM: Okay, I leave him there and come out of it.

01:56:01.272 --> 01:56:02.814
LAURA: What'd you see?

01:56:02.814 --> 01:56:06.547
LIAM: Well, it's a good walk a ways,
and then there is a larger chamber with

01:56:06.547 --> 01:56:14.361
many different exits to it, and my good boy
saw some sort of creature in a cage.

01:56:14.361 --> 01:56:16.269
LAURA: How big of a creature?

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:18.449
LIAM: Wuh.

01:56:20.089 --> 01:56:21.421
LAURA: Did it seem cute?

01:56:21.421 --> 01:56:22.774
LIAM: Hard to tell.

01:56:23.394 --> 01:56:26.701
SAM: You said there's a lot of entrances
and exits to this place?

01:56:26.701 --> 01:56:27.633
LIAM: Yeah.

01:56:27.633 --> 01:56:32.004
MATT: They're platforms, the topography of the
inside-- it's not just a perfectly oval thing.

01:56:32.004 --> 01:56:36.052
It has a bunch of pieces of rock and stone
and levels where these tunnels

01:56:36.052 --> 01:56:38.524
are emerging and appearing.

01:56:38.524 --> 01:56:45.025
SAM: We know that the cricks have been making
many attacks, so maybe this is where they go,

01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:49.180
this is Grand Central and then they shoot off
to different places to attack.

01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:52.288
LIAM: Or this is an old abandoned place. You know,
I don't know what the right thing to do is because

01:56:52.288 --> 01:56:58.448
if we keep following this tunnel, we could roll
right up into their backyard where they ended

01:56:58.448 --> 01:57:03.753
their journey, walk right into them. However,
we don't really know where this place is going;

01:57:03.753 --> 01:57:09.001
we don't know how far it is from where your
husband is going to be. We don't know

01:57:09.001 --> 01:57:16.587
what dangers are above us. However, we could
come in and try to find him, not walking directly

01:57:16.587 --> 01:57:21.113
into their line of sight, right into their face,
or their butt, or what-have-you.

01:57:21.113 --> 01:57:23.191
I don't know what the right thing to do is.

01:57:23.191 --> 01:57:24.192
SAM: I don't either.

01:57:24.192 --> 01:57:30.962
TRAVIS: My two cents: I think they did a pretty
good job of closing up these tunnels, right? Made

01:57:30.962 --> 01:57:35.766
it so that the average Joe or even someone
able-bodied would be unable to follow them.

01:57:35.766 --> 01:57:39.057
I think this is probably the last place they
think someone would come from.

01:57:39.057 --> 01:57:41.075
Above ground, pretty sure they're covered.

01:57:41.075 --> 01:57:43.039
LAURA: That's a good point, Fjord.

01:57:43.039 --> 01:57:44.464
LIAM: That is a good point.

01:57:44.464 --> 01:57:49.075
TALIESIN: I just wish we knew what these things
were. I would have loved to explore some of these.

01:57:49.075 --> 01:57:51.554
TRAVIS: They're small, right? They're small
tunnels.

01:57:51.554 --> 01:57:52.405
MATT: Yeah.

01:57:52.406 --> 01:57:56.977
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, we're already dealing with
the two-body-width tunnel as it is; I don't want

01:57:56.977 --> 01:57:59.571
to shrink it down any lower and really be fucked.

01:57:59.571 --> 01:58:03.955
TALIESIN: My thought was we could send the cat up
and down really quick and just take a look.

01:58:03.955 --> 01:58:04.961
TRAVIS: Send the cat?

01:58:04.961 --> 01:58:08.646
TALIESIN: We have a cat we can just send
down the smaller tunnel really quick.

01:58:08.647 --> 01:58:10.693
I don't know why we don't just take a peek.

01:58:10.693 --> 01:58:12.217
LAURA: That is what we're doing.

01:58:12.218 --> 01:58:14.404
TALIESIN: We sent the cat down the big tunnel.

01:58:14.404 --> 01:58:18.308
MATT: Yeah, the cat continued down the big
tunnel and found that other chamber. The

01:58:18.308 --> 01:58:20.507
tunnel continues past that chamber,
by the way.

01:58:20.507 --> 01:58:22.892
TRAVIS: I thought the cat went up the
small tunnel.

01:58:22.892 --> 01:58:23.647
LAURA: Me too.

01:58:23.647 --> 01:58:25.174
TALIESIN: I had a funny feeling.

01:58:25.174 --> 01:58:29.267
MATT: No, this was Frumpkin going ahead on
the tunnel you guys were traveling and found

01:58:29.267 --> 01:58:32.977
that other chamber, and the tunnel continues
on the other side of this chamber.

01:58:32.977 --> 01:58:36.413
LIAM: We didn't take the side with
Frumpkin. Just confusion, that's fine.

01:58:36.413 --> 01:58:39.864
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's send him up the
small one. That's what I was thinking.

01:58:39.864 --> 01:58:41.193
LAURA: Yeah, bring him back.

01:58:41.193 --> 01:58:45.806
LIAM: Well, he knows to come back in five minutes
if he does not hear from me, so we have to wait.

01:58:45.807 --> 01:58:47.142
MATT: Yep. Frumpkin returns.

01:58:47.142 --> 01:58:51.305
TALIESIN: I'd say the downward one,
just a quick look, not too far down.

01:58:51.305 --> 01:58:53.019
Top one, quick look, not too far up.

01:58:53.019 --> 01:58:54.782
LAURA: Yeah. Go down the little ones?

01:58:54.782 --> 01:59:06.298
MATT: Frumpkin heads into the small side tunnel.
Curves around about 20 or so feet, and then it

01:59:06.299 --> 01:59:18.416
opens up into another small chamber. What Frumpkin
sees is a ten by 15-foot opening area with a pile

01:59:18.416 --> 01:59:25.824
of matted material, like cloth-- it may have been
at one point, but it's soiled. You see two figures

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:32.144
sitting there. One of them is in the process of
fitting something together or pulling something

01:59:32.144 --> 01:59:43.090
apart, and the other is currently gnawing on some
sort of a long-dried bone. They're tiny, humanoid,

01:59:43.090 --> 01:59:57.828
longer snout, tails, scaly skin. I would say,
lizard- or almost dragon-like, but very tiny.

01:59:57.829 --> 02:00:03.994
They're both sitting in there,
spears set to the side (gnawing noises).

02:00:03.994 --> 02:00:06.787
LIAM: About how far away from me has
Frumpkin gone at this point?

02:00:06.787 --> 02:00:08.333
MATT: About 30 or so feet.

02:00:08.333 --> 02:00:12.407
LIAM: 30 or so feet. (snaps fingers)
Pull him back. I don't know

02:00:12.407 --> 02:00:14.672
if they saw him or not; he is glowing.

02:00:14.672 --> 02:00:16.171
MATT and LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:00:16.171 --> 02:00:18.789
MATT: The last thing Frumpkin sees is
them go (hiss).

02:00:18.789 --> 02:00:26.613
LIAM: (fwoomp) Little lizard people down
that way, and they saw my cat.

02:00:26.613 --> 02:00:27.932
LAURA: Cool.

02:00:27.933 --> 02:00:29.585
TALIESIN: I'd rather them see us now than--

02:00:29.585 --> 02:00:32.886
TRAVIS: I'll run up and push myself up against
the wall, against where the tunnel is,

02:00:32.887 --> 02:00:35.487
just in case they decide to come out that way.

02:00:35.487 --> 02:00:40.024
LIAM: I will take the other side of it
and do the same thing.

02:00:40.024 --> 02:00:43.010
MATT: Okay. You guys all heading to split
to the sides?

02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:44.677
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to fan out.

02:00:44.678 --> 02:00:48.588
TRAVIS: Do we hear any movement coming
from the tunnel?

02:00:48.588 --> 02:00:58.909
MATT: You hear a (snarling), and you see a
spearhead slowly emerge from the tunnel

02:00:58.909 --> 02:01:07.747
and its head poke out ever so slightly.
Make stealth checks, guys, by the way,

02:01:07.747 --> 02:01:10.201
because this is now going to see you.

02:01:10.201 --> 02:01:14.857
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all
of us while we were hiding. Is that okay?

02:01:14.857 --> 02:01:18.686
MATT: I'll say a straight stealth check on
this one, this happened too quickly.

02:01:18.686 --> 02:01:20.049
LAURA: Okay.

02:01:20.049 --> 02:01:21.766
SAM: May I use my cloak?

02:01:21.766 --> 02:01:25.078
MATT: Yeah, your cloak affects any stealth
check you make, for the most part.

02:01:25.078 --> 02:01:28.109
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a six.

02:01:28.109 --> 02:01:29.231
MATT: Cool.

02:01:29.232 --> 02:01:30.765
TRAVIS: Fjord rolled a 15.

02:01:30.765 --> 02:01:32.253
MARISHA: 17.

02:01:32.253 --> 02:01:33.734
MATT: All right.

02:01:33.734 --> 02:01:35.611
SAM: Caleb?

02:01:35.611 --> 02:01:37.201
LIAM: Oh, a 17.

02:01:37.201 --> 02:01:38.490
SAM: 21.

02:01:38.490 --> 02:01:39.801
LAURA: Eight.

02:01:39.801 --> 02:01:41.190
TALIESIN: 20.

02:01:41.190 --> 02:01:50.453
MATT: Okay. It pokes its head out.
(sniffs) Looks right over towards Fjord

02:01:50.453 --> 02:01:52.460
and goes (questioning chitters).

02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:54.923
TRAVIS: I reach down and grab the spear
and yank it out of its hands!

02:01:54.924 --> 02:01:56.431
MATT: (yelling)

02:01:56.431 --> 02:01:58.232
TRAVIS: What are you?! (yells)

02:01:58.232 --> 02:02:01.665
MATT: The one behind it looks through
and is like (alarmed hiss) and turns around

02:02:01.665 --> 02:02:04.561
and runs down the hall, and the one
that's there is like (panting).

02:02:04.561 --> 02:02:08.706
LIAM: I pull out a small, little stone pyramid
in my hand and mutter a few words

02:02:08.706 --> 02:02:11.957
and then cast Tongues and
speak to this little thing.

02:02:11.957 --> 02:02:17.068
MATT: All right. Well, as you're casting
the spell, you hear the one that ran back

02:02:17.068 --> 02:02:19.557
go like (shouts of alarm).

02:02:19.558 --> 02:02:20.860
LAURA: Oh no.

02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:22.193
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

02:02:22.193 --> 02:02:26.117
MATT: You begin to hear this echoing sound
of lots of claws scurrying their way

02:02:26.117 --> 02:02:27.913
through the nearby tunnels.

02:02:27.914 --> 02:02:29.281
TRAVIS: No! No, no!

02:02:29.384 --> 02:02:31.794
MATT: And that's where we're going to go
and take a break.

02:02:31.794 --> 02:02:33.785
(yelling)

02:02:33.785 --> 02:02:36.322
LIAM: That's the best!

02:02:36.322 --> 02:02:38.801
TALIESIN: We've got to get both out of them.

02:02:38.802 --> 02:02:40.904
MARISHA: Talk to them,
tell them we're friends!

02:02:40.904 --> 02:02:42.358
LAURA: Stop them!

02:02:42.358 --> 02:02:44.889
MATT: We'll come back here in just a moment
to pick up from there.

02:02:44.889 --> 02:02:48.059
LIAM: Did I hear something like,
"Look at these motherfuckers out there!"?

02:02:48.059 --> 02:02:51.547
MATT: As you were casting the spell, this
suddenly happens-- it wasn't finished--

02:02:51.548 --> 02:02:54.504
and when we come back, I'll begin to give you
the idea of what you're beginning to hear.

02:02:54.504 --> 02:02:55.959
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:02:55.959 --> 02:03:00.275
MATT: So we'll be back here in a few minutes from
break. As part of our giveaway, we have these

02:03:00.275 --> 02:03:07.658
really cool custom Valentine's Day dice vaults
here. You can pick up your own special vault.

02:03:07.705 --> 02:03:13.009
They're customized with five wood and inlay
options, and your own message is translated in

02:03:13.009 --> 02:03:17.796
Elvish, which you can see there. They'll arrive
before Valentine's Day if you order before

02:03:17.796 --> 02:03:21.539
February 7th, so you've got to get to that soon.
We're giving away these two tonight, two lucky

02:03:21.539 --> 02:03:29.063
winners. The key word for this is "underground,"
one word, "underground." Come on over to the

02:03:29.063 --> 02:03:32.545
Critical Role Twitch chat, that's
twitch.tv/criticalrole. Enter the word

02:03:32.545 --> 02:03:35.636
"underground" once-- more than once, you'll be
disqualified-- and we'll come back with the

02:03:35.637 --> 02:03:40.284
winners. This is only good, of course, in the
United States and Canada, excluding Quebec.

02:03:40.284 --> 02:03:42.313
But yeah, we'll see you guys here
in a few minutes.

02:03:42.313 --> 02:03:44.697
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

02:03:45.468 --> 02:03:50.113
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back. We have
our two winners for the two dice vaults.

02:03:50.113 --> 02:03:52.830
The first winner is Rickymarooo!

02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:55.476
SAM and TRAVIS: Rickymarooo!

02:03:55.476 --> 02:04:02.074
MATT: The second one, it appears to be--
it's 2r0m0c0. Congratulations, you?

02:04:02.074 --> 02:04:03.364
TRAVIS: Bot username.

02:04:03.744 --> 02:04:05.375
MARISHA: Yeah, bot!

02:04:05.375 --> 02:04:10.027
MATT: We'll get you guys your successful
wins soon. Before I forget,

02:04:10.027 --> 02:04:12.889
I was going to mention it beforehand,
I totally forgot. For those who don't know,

02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:15.374
there's a Rick and Morty versus
Dungeons and Dragons comic book.

02:04:15.374 --> 02:04:16.821
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

02:04:16.821 --> 02:04:18.931
MATT: They just released the fourth and
final issue. It's written by our friend

02:04:18.931 --> 02:04:23.129
of the show, Patrick Rothfuss, if you
remember from campaign one.

02:04:23.129 --> 02:04:28.365
ALL: (mimicking Matt) Patrick Rothfuss.

02:04:28.425 --> 02:04:29.909
LAURA: Author extraordinaire.

02:04:29.966 --> 02:04:34.647
MATT: Patrick Rothfuss! Drawn by Jim Zub.
It's a great team, and a number of people

02:04:34.647 --> 02:04:41.959
from the community make little cameos in it.
Our friend and love of all D&amp;D, Chris Perkins,

02:04:41.959 --> 02:04:45.545
is in it, Satine's in it. Apparently I'm in
this issue? Which is kind of nuts. So yeah.

02:04:45.545 --> 02:04:50.118
It's pretty awesome, you should
check it out if you have the opportunity.

02:04:50.118 --> 02:04:51.943
TALIESIN: It's pretty great.

02:04:51.974 --> 02:04:56.299
MATT: It's pretty awesome. Gary Gygax's
ghost says a fun phrase.

02:04:56.316 --> 02:04:58.722
TRAVIS: Same page as you.

02:04:58.722 --> 02:05:07.153
MATT: Indeed. Anyway. Getting back into the
insanity, you had just grabbed the spear from a

02:05:07.153 --> 02:05:12.870
nearby kobold as the other one rushed off. I would
like for you to make a strength check, please.

02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:17.374
TRAVIS: Oh, good. This is my forte these days.

02:05:17.452 --> 02:05:20.212
MARISHA: You were just lifting so many
pebbles, you'll be great.

02:05:21.385 --> 02:05:23.014
TRAVIS: 11.

02:05:23.015 --> 02:05:26.019
SAM: Against a tiny little thing.

02:05:26.019 --> 02:05:29.994
MATT: No. You grab its spear and it goes (yell).

02:05:29.994 --> 02:05:32.542
TRAVIS: Fuck! That's so embarrassing!

02:05:32.542 --> 02:05:37.807
MATT: And pulls it back from you as you hear the
mounting skittering of numerous creatures now

02:05:37.807 --> 02:05:43.331
coming from behind where you were and from
the nearby tunnels. What are you guys doing?

02:05:43.331 --> 02:05:47.753
LIAM: Wait, just to specify, from up where
Frumpkin just was, from that direction?

02:05:47.753 --> 02:05:49.043
Or multiple directions?

02:05:49.043 --> 02:05:50.345
MATT: Multiple directions, behind you.

02:05:50.345 --> 02:05:51.813
LIAM: They're in the honeycombs in
the ceiling, right?

02:05:51.813 --> 02:05:52.481
MATT: Apparently.

02:05:52.481 --> 02:05:53.671
LIAM: Yeah.

02:05:53.671 --> 02:05:57.381
LAURA: I cast Disguise Self and
make myself look like a giant one of them.

02:05:57.382 --> 02:06:00.117
MARISHA: Oh man, not again!

02:06:00.117 --> 02:06:02.219
TRAVIS: We should run. We should go.

02:06:02.219 --> 02:06:04.180
TALIESIN: Let's head to the tunnel,
then head to the main room.

02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:05.252
TRAVIS: Just run forward.

02:06:05.252 --> 02:06:07.137
MARISHA: (yelling)

02:06:07.137 --> 02:06:09.681
MATT: As you're casting the spell,
transforming into a larger kobold,

02:06:09.681 --> 02:06:14.575
you start rushing forward. Are you guys
all heading forward with Fjord?

02:06:14.575 --> 02:06:16.622
MARISHA: I will head forward--

02:06:16.622 --> 02:06:18.038
LIAM: Mage Armor.

02:06:18.038 --> 02:06:22.728
MARISHA: -- but power walking
like a badass, strolling behind, in case

02:06:22.728 --> 02:06:24.876
I want to deck some kobolds in the face.

02:06:24.876 --> 02:06:30.553
MATT: Okay. You guys charge forward around the
corner into the next chamber. That chamber has

02:06:30.553 --> 02:06:36.603
about 20 or so kobolds that have emerged from, or
are in the process of emerging from, the different

02:06:36.604 --> 02:06:46.634
tunnels, that are all facing your direction with
small, dinged blades and crossbows that look like

02:06:46.634 --> 02:06:53.029
they might work. Spears, and small leather and
wood shields, and they all fill the chamber

02:06:53.029 --> 02:06:58.877
in front of you, going (chittering, snarling).
They're holding the line. What are you doing?

02:06:58.877 --> 02:07:04.151
LIAM: We have come to speak, I say, in whatever
language I now understand and speak.

02:07:04.151 --> 02:07:05.325
TALIESIN: I'm going to augment that.

02:07:05.325 --> 02:07:07.425
LAURA: I act like I'm saying it.

02:07:10.252 --> 02:07:12.756
LIAM: Oh, I made it very clear and held my hand.

02:07:12.756 --> 02:07:17.032
MATT: Yeah. There's definitely a confused division
and attention here as they're like (chittering).

02:07:17.032 --> 02:07:19.052
TRAVIS: World of magic and mystery!

02:07:19.052 --> 02:07:21.525
TALIESIN: They can all hear you.

02:07:21.525 --> 02:07:28.699
LIAM: We have come through to chase a large
serpent through these caves and eradicate it.

02:07:29.061 --> 02:07:33.965
MATT: The ones behind Beau-- as you're strolling
up and he's shouting this out, there are about ten

02:07:33.965 --> 02:07:38.598
or so kobolds that begin to rush up from behind,
and they see you, and they slow their step and

02:07:38.598 --> 02:07:42.447
start taking their spears and prodding you
to join the rest of the people.

02:07:42.447 --> 02:07:45.665
LAURA: Also, tell them that I'm their god.

02:07:45.666 --> 02:07:47.400
LIAM: Easy.

02:07:48.777 --> 02:07:53.799
MATT: There's one in the center. Of all of them
that are there, there's one that is covered in

02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:58.770
cages and boxes and leather straps. There's
another that has heavy pieces of armor,

02:07:58.770 --> 02:08:05.913
almost weighing him down. You see others that look
like skirmishers that are all gathered around,

02:08:05.913 --> 02:08:12.554
and they all have this growling, barking energy.
They look a bit hungry, a bit sallow,

02:08:12.554 --> 02:08:17.613
and the one that's in the full armor steps forward
towards you and you and is looking

02:08:17.614 --> 02:08:19.958
back and forth and gives you this curious look.

02:08:19.958 --> 02:08:30.226
LIAM: We are here looking for a scourge
in these mountains. Oh boy.

02:08:30.226 --> 02:08:35.026
We mean you no harm. We wish to pass through.

02:08:36.594 --> 02:08:40.926
MATT: (grunts) You hear him say,
in Draconic, "Come forth, loud meal."

02:08:40.926 --> 02:08:43.929
TRAVIS: Nice, Draconic!

02:08:43.929 --> 02:08:49.233
LAURA: Oh man, I was trying to make it
look like I was talking, Caleb! Argh!

02:08:49.308 --> 02:08:53.019
MATT: There are a number that are
staring at you in half awe, like--

02:08:53.019 --> 02:08:54.543
TRAVIS: Deity!

02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:00.934
LIAM: In Draconic, saying-- well,
through the spell: I am one meal,

02:09:00.935 --> 02:09:05.971
but my friends can make more
food than me. I am--

02:09:05.971 --> 02:09:07.244
MATT: Do you approach?

02:09:07.244 --> 02:09:08.415
LIAM: I take two steps forward.

02:09:08.415 --> 02:09:09.946
MATT: All right, make a dexterity saving throw.

02:09:09.946 --> 02:09:11.276
LIAM: Okay.

02:09:12.385 --> 02:09:15.040
MARISHA: What? Why though?

02:09:15.433 --> 02:09:18.741
LIAM: Two steps forward-- that's an 11.

02:09:18.741 --> 02:09:24.615
MATT: As you're saying this with intensity and
force, you guys watch as suddenly there's a cloud

02:09:24.615 --> 02:09:32.718
of dust around his ankles, and a rope loop wraps
and pulls your legs together and hoists you up,

02:09:32.719 --> 02:09:37.591
and you're now dangling about three,
four feet off the ground.

02:09:37.591 --> 02:09:42.556
LIAM: I only take this as a minor setback.
We can still work this out.

02:09:42.556 --> 02:09:46.606
MATT: At which point all the kobolds--
there's this large wave of cackles.

02:09:46.606 --> 02:09:49.620
The one raises his hand up and
they all get quiet and he goes--

02:09:49.621 --> 02:09:51.483
TALIESIN: That's pretty funny!

02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:53.411
MARISHA: That's pretty good!

02:09:53.411 --> 02:09:59.080
MATT: "You! Loud food!"
Points at the rest of you.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:03.530
MARISHA: You're just dangling.

02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:09.164
MATT: "You want pass?" Yep, as your hair is just
dripping there and you're slowly (creaking).

02:10:09.164 --> 02:10:12.987
LAURA: His coat up. Yeah.

02:10:13.764 --> 02:10:18.271
MATT: He's following you with this nasty looking
shortsword that looks like the edges of it

02:10:18.271 --> 02:10:23.113
are grimed up with black oil or something.

02:10:23.641 --> 02:10:29.958
LIAM: You do not want to tangle with the spirits I
command. I snap my fingers and Frumpkin appears,

02:10:29.958 --> 02:10:36.256
and four globules of light float
in a circle around Frumpkin.

02:10:37.534 --> 02:10:40.330
MATT: "Ugh!" Takes a step back.
Make an intimidation check.

02:10:41.366 --> 02:10:42.974
TRAVIS: Upside down.

02:10:43.708 --> 02:10:46.969
MARISHA: Beware the spirit of the Maine Coon.

02:10:47.941 --> 02:10:50.426
LIAM: Intimidation? That's a 19.

02:10:50.426 --> 02:10:56.869
MATT: "He who summoned kitty spirit."

02:10:59.087 --> 02:11:02.385
LIAM: You will be cursed for decades.

02:11:02.385 --> 02:11:05.085
MATT: "We already cursed!"

02:11:05.085 --> 02:11:06.684
LAURA: What does it say?

02:11:06.684 --> 02:11:19.568
MATT: "You in no position. You in &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; position.
So you give one to feed, or trade for food."

02:11:19.568 --> 02:11:25.357
He's looking at you. He's making this challenge
to you, but is definitely keeping a distance,

02:11:25.357 --> 02:11:29.839
and is taking a step back from where he was
standing so confidently in your direction.

02:11:29.839 --> 02:11:32.915
LIAM: You expect me to hand over one of my own?

02:11:34.402 --> 02:11:35.718
MATT: "Yes!"

02:11:35.718 --> 02:11:43.248
LIAM: This cat will burn you-- burn you all.

02:11:43.248 --> 02:11:45.605
LAURA: He sounds very intimidating right now.

02:11:45.605 --> 02:11:46.325
TALIESIN: I heard that, right?

02:11:46.325 --> 02:11:47.002
MATT: Yeah--

02:11:47.002 --> 02:11:50.852
LIAM: No, it's in Drac-- well, I don't know.
I'm speaking through a spell, so--

02:11:50.852 --> 02:11:51.943
TALIESIN: Oh. Yeah.

02:11:51.943 --> 02:11:55.326
MATT: Looking at the specifics of Tongues here.

02:11:55.326 --> 02:11:57.075
SAM: Tongues.

02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:04.665
MATT: "Any creature that knows at least one
language can hear and understand it,"

02:12:04.666 --> 02:12:06.714
so it's not so much that you're speaking
Draconic, but any creature that knows

02:12:06.714 --> 02:12:08.433
language can understand you.
So all of you hear this.

02:12:08.434 --> 02:12:09.520
LIAM: So we're all on the same page.

02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:10.062
MATT: Yes.

02:12:10.062 --> 02:12:11.264
LIAM: Oh, that's excellent.

02:12:11.265 --> 02:12:12.516
LAURA: Yay! We can make food.

02:12:12.516 --> 02:12:13.995
TALIESIN: We can't understand them,
but we can understand you.

02:12:13.995 --> 02:12:16.129
MATT: Actually, strangely enough,
it's speaking in broken Common.

02:12:16.129 --> 02:12:18.278
TALIESIN and LAURA: Oh.

02:12:18.278 --> 02:12:27.189
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, we can make some food
I suppose, or we can let the cat have his way.

02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:32.345
Is there any way I can just add a Thaumaturgy
effect to the cat really quickly?

02:12:32.346 --> 02:12:33.960
MATT: How so? What do you want to enhance?

02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:37.290
TALIESIN: I want the ground around the cat
to shake gently and start having

02:12:37.290 --> 02:12:40.109
a minor earthquake effect.

02:12:40.367 --> 02:12:43.615
LIAM: Frumpkin stands and does that little--

02:12:43.615 --> 02:12:46.750
MATT: As Frumpkin does that, and the rocks shake
and tumble around in this small quaking noise,

02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:50.861
about six of the nearby kobolds go (gasping),
and start skitting away from it,

02:12:50.862 --> 02:12:55.030
holding their weapons at bay. Two of them in
the tunnels all of a sudden go (squeaking),

02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:56.369
and climb up in the tunnels and vanish.

02:12:56.369 --> 02:12:57.403
LAURA: Aww!

02:12:57.403 --> 02:12:59.201
TALIESIN: We have food, though.

02:12:59.201 --> 02:13:08.949
LAURA: Yes, little me's, we have food for you!
Worship me! I am your leader!

02:13:08.949 --> 02:13:10.602
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:13:10.602 --> 02:13:11.822
SAM: "I am your leader!"

02:13:11.822 --> 02:13:13.460
TALIESIN: Oh lord.

02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.408
LAURA and TALIESIN: Ah!

02:13:15.408 --> 02:13:17.275
LAURA: 12.

02:13:17.275 --> 02:13:21.393
MATT: You see two of them begin to reach towards
you, like-- (excited breathing).

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:22.853
LAURA: Yes!

02:13:22.854 --> 02:13:26.497
MATT: The one in the full armor goes,
"No pay attention!" and slaps them

02:13:26.497 --> 02:13:30.412
with his spear and they (snarl).

02:13:30.412 --> 02:13:32.145
TRAVIS: How about the food?

02:13:32.145 --> 02:13:34.207
LAURA: We bring food for you.

02:13:34.207 --> 02:13:35.626
MATT: "Trade!"

02:13:35.626 --> 02:13:42.843
TALIESIN: We'll need containers. Do you
have a couple of pots? Big containers.

02:13:42.843 --> 02:13:48.540
MATT: "Sybil!" Points to one in there and you see
this one kobold that's covered in rags-- kind of

02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:55.443
looks like the collector lady from Labyrinth--
and pulls out this large, billowing leather sack

02:13:55.443 --> 02:14:00.697
that's stained of all sorts of colors around its
basis. (heavy breathing) It holds it up. Its jaw

02:14:00.697 --> 02:14:07.305
is slightly dislodged on one side and gives it
this crooked grin to its face. Holds it open.

02:14:07.305 --> 02:14:12.469
TALIESIN: Do you have one more? I can do two,
if you've got two. I can do water, also.

02:14:12.469 --> 02:14:14.712
Do you care about water? I can do water.

02:14:14.712 --> 02:14:16.302
MATT: "We have water."

02:14:16.302 --> 02:14:17.067
TALIESIN: That's fair.

02:14:17.067 --> 02:14:18.772
MATT: "Fill food!"

02:14:18.772 --> 02:14:27.006
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a little piece
of fungus off the stick, and I'm going to

02:14:27.006 --> 02:14:29.425
put it in there, and I'm going to start
casting Create Food and Water

02:14:29.425 --> 02:14:33.873
and it's going to suddenly become
45 pounds of food.

02:14:33.873 --> 02:14:37.652
MATT: (thudding) The thing all of a sudden slams
into the ground, the heavy weight from the

02:14:37.652 --> 02:14:44.125
summoned meal hitting the heavy rock floor.
As soon as that kobold leans forward,

02:14:44.125 --> 02:14:48.995
pulled off of his feet and manages to stumble
into it and look inside. (sniffs) "Whoa!"

02:14:48.995 --> 02:14:53.841
Begins to shovel it. The leader then goes,
"Stop! We eat!"

02:14:53.841 --> 02:14:56.475
TALIESIN and LAURA: It's good.

02:14:57.155 --> 02:15:01.790
MATT: "Two may pass. More food
for trade rest. Huh?"

02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:09.209
LIAM: The Fey King is growing angry with you, and
the globules of light start to spin a little quicker.

02:15:09.209 --> 02:15:12.261
TALIESIN: A little more thunder maybe.

02:15:12.261 --> 02:15:15.717
MATT: "Two and the Fey King can also pass."

02:15:15.717 --> 02:15:19.741
LAURA: What about the leader-- your leader?
Can I go?

02:15:19.741 --> 02:15:24.350
MATT: You see the others all nervously looking
towards the other, and you can see him feeling

02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:29.963
really intimidated by your presence. There's this
idea of him being the head of this sect and you

02:15:29.963 --> 02:15:35.190
storming in here, and he's just-- this jealous
intensity as it stares towards you and goes,

02:15:35.190 --> 02:15:41.806
"Do not listen! Why you come?"

02:15:41.806 --> 02:15:45.879
LAURA: I came because I'm a really good
friend of yours. I'm a leader here,

02:15:45.879 --> 02:15:50.969
and also I just wanted to go
through with my friends?

02:15:52.361 --> 02:15:55.064
MATT: "False leader may go as well!"

02:15:55.064 --> 02:15:57.048
LAURA: Yes!

02:15:57.048 --> 02:16:00.093
TRAVIS: We have two gator skins
in the bag of holding.

02:16:00.093 --> 02:16:01.806
MATT: "What? Gator?"

02:16:01.806 --> 02:16:02.598
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:16:02.598 --> 02:16:03.289
MATT: "What?"

02:16:03.290 --> 02:16:06.269
TRAVIS: Are you interested in gator?
It's like real tough leather.

02:16:06.269 --> 02:16:07.666
I mean, bet you could use it as some--

02:16:07.666 --> 02:16:09.385
TALIESIN: I don't think they'd be interested.
It's way too nice for them.

02:16:09.385 --> 02:16:10.862
I don't think that they really--

02:16:10.863 --> 02:16:14.247
MATT: You can see four other mouths watering
as you're describing this tough gator skin.

02:16:14.247 --> 02:16:17.011
TALIESIN: That's so expensive and difficult
to come by, in this part of the world.

02:16:17.011 --> 02:16:19.090
TRAVIS: I know, yeah, it's so rare. I mean, maybe
it's better we just hold onto the gator.

02:16:19.090 --> 02:16:20.722
TALIESIN: You don't want-- I mean, we certainly
don't want to give it up.

02:16:20.722 --> 02:16:21.930
MATT: "Give us gator skin!"

02:16:21.930 --> 02:16:23.247
TALIESIN: Well.

02:16:23.248 --> 02:16:26.544
TRAVIS: I don't know. I mean, I could maybe part
with one for the rest of us--

02:16:26.544 --> 02:16:28.189
MATT: "No! All of it!"

02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:34.002
TRAVIS: Well, all right. I pull out two
gator skins. My friends will

02:16:34.002 --> 02:16:36.709
have to be able to go on their way.

02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:39.089
TALIESIN: Mister Fjord, are you sure?

02:16:39.089 --> 02:16:42.250
TRAVIS: I mean, I hate to. They're worth
a fortune and, boy, the protection

02:16:42.250 --> 02:16:52.857
that they yield, mmm dogie. Ah-- okay.

02:16:54.261 --> 02:17:02.339
MATT: (satisfied grunt) Puts it over the side
pouch of one of the other ones-- carries it and,

02:17:02.339 --> 02:17:06.039
(excited grunt). Is that both of them?

02:17:06.039 --> 02:17:07.472
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:17:07.472 --> 02:17:10.036
LAURA: That's all of us then, huh?
We can go then?

02:17:10.036 --> 02:17:13.038
TALIESIN: Yeah, because there was the two,
and then the other two, and then the king,

02:17:13.038 --> 02:17:14.026
and the leader.

02:17:14.026 --> 02:17:15.258
LAURA: Then the leader, and then
we had the friends with the--

02:17:15.258 --> 02:17:16.849
SAM: I'm only a half, really. I'm half.

02:17:16.849 --> 02:17:19.299
LAURA: Then the guy that's hanging.
That's important, too.

02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:21.649
TALIESIN: I think that's half of the next person,
that comes through at that point.

02:17:21.649 --> 02:17:22.934
LAURA: Definitely.

02:17:22.934 --> 02:17:30.273
MATT: One of them steps forward and goes,
"I think that is--" "Shh! I'm making number!"

02:17:30.273 --> 02:17:35.659
SAM: I can also offer you this-- I have a pouch of
smoking tobacco. You could smoke this

02:17:35.659 --> 02:17:39.738
and it will make you forget your troubles.

02:17:40.675 --> 02:17:45.311
MATT: It leans forward towards you, giving a look
and goes, "You (sniffs), goblin."

02:17:45.311 --> 02:17:48.813
SAM: Yes.

02:17:49.748 --> 02:17:52.035
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:17:53.224 --> 02:17:54.765
SAM: Jesus. 17.

02:17:54.766 --> 02:17:56.458
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:17:56.458 --> 02:17:59.458
MATT: Takes the pouch from you. (sniffs)

02:17:59.458 --> 02:18:06.958
SAM: No. Don't eat it. It's for smoking, really.
You can eat it. Ugh!

02:18:09.961 --> 02:18:12.285
MATT: "Accepted."

02:18:12.285 --> 02:18:13.491
SAM: All right.

02:18:13.491 --> 02:18:19.128
MATT: Takes and places it in the pouch.
"(shouting Draconic)," it shouts.

02:18:19.128 --> 02:18:23.578
You being able to recognize, saying,
"All right, let them pass."

02:18:23.578 --> 02:18:29.852
MARISHA: I jump down and take out one of
my shurikens and chop Caleb free.

02:18:29.852 --> 02:18:32.168
MATT: (thudding) Like a sack of potatoes.

02:18:32.168 --> 02:18:33.489
LIAM: Is that 1d6?

02:18:33.489 --> 02:18:37.209
MATT: From that height? Yeah, that would
be four points of bludgeoning damage.

02:18:37.209 --> 02:18:38.472
MARISHA: Ah, jeez.

02:18:38.472 --> 02:18:42.336
TALIESIN: I'm just making sure nobody's tried to--
I've been trying to keep an eye on things.

02:18:42.337 --> 02:18:43.996
LAURA: Yeah, I don't want them ganking our stuff.

02:18:43.996 --> 02:18:45.827
TALIESIN: Nobody's tried to gank anything, right?

02:18:45.827 --> 02:18:47.401
LAURA: I've got my hands on our stuff
the whole time.

02:18:47.401 --> 02:18:49.773
MATT: Okay. You're keeping watch, and a few do get
close and they're definitely eyeing the various

02:18:49.774 --> 02:18:53.791
trinkets that dangle from your belts, but as any
of them start getting close you grab and they pull

02:18:53.791 --> 02:19:02.335
back. The leader goes, "Go. Follow path of big
worm. Make big mess. Go!"

02:19:02.335 --> 02:19:03.622
LAURA: Nugget, come on!

02:19:03.622 --> 02:19:04.613
TRAVIS: Wait, a path the big one?

02:19:04.613 --> 02:19:05.838
MARISHA: Make big mess?

02:19:05.838 --> 02:19:12.726
LAURA: Oh yeah, question about that: Did you see
how many of them there were with the big worm?

02:19:12.726 --> 02:19:16.042
MATT: Just looking at you angrily, this--

02:19:16.042 --> 02:19:18.037
LAURA: The guys that made a big mess?

02:19:18.037 --> 02:19:20.688
MATT: "Big mess. Move through. No longer here."

02:19:20.688 --> 02:19:23.772
LAURA: How long ago, do you know?

02:19:23.773 --> 02:19:25.500
MATT: "Days, weeks."

02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:28.794
LAURA: Did it seem like a lot of people?

02:19:28.794 --> 02:19:31.246
MATT: "Very loud. Ruin tunnel."

02:19:31.247 --> 02:19:33.099
LAURA: How big was the worm?

02:19:33.099 --> 02:19:35.427
MATT: "Very big."

02:19:35.427 --> 02:19:38.953
SAM: They're very small though, so in relation to
them it may well be--

02:19:38.953 --> 02:19:40.869
LAURA: That's true, it's kind of--

02:19:40.869 --> 02:19:43.017
TRAVIS: Ask them if they've been all the way to
the end of the--

02:19:43.017 --> 02:19:43.915
SAM: You can ask them.

02:19:43.916 --> 02:19:45.036
LAURA: They understand us.

02:19:45.036 --> 02:19:49.273
TRAVIS: Have you been all the way to the end of
big mess tunnel?

02:19:49.274 --> 02:19:50.880
MATT: "No. No go."

02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:51.659
TRAVIS: Why not?

02:19:51.659 --> 02:19:55.145
MATT: "Stay here, home. Eat food from you."

02:19:55.145 --> 02:19:57.661
TALIESIN: That is fair.

02:19:57.661 --> 02:20:02.075
LIAM: Do you know who is caged up, aways down this
tunnel?

02:20:02.075 --> 02:20:07.014
MATT: "What?" Points over to the small cage with
the little creature, you mean?

02:20:07.014 --> 02:20:08.314
LIAM: Oh, it's in this room?

02:20:08.314 --> 02:20:09.543
TRAVIS: Yeah, we ran forward.

02:20:09.543 --> 02:20:10.992
LIAM: Oh, I see. Got it.

02:20:10.992 --> 02:20:13.366
TRAVIS: Yeah, what is in that cage?

02:20:13.366 --> 02:20:15.765
MATT: "Is food."

02:20:15.766 --> 02:20:18.655
LAURA: No, don't eat it!

02:20:18.655 --> 02:20:20.198
SAM: Is it cute, or not?

02:20:20.198 --> 02:20:21.852
MATT: It's pretty ragged.

02:20:21.852 --> 02:20:26.273
TRAVIS: Are we going to pass judgment
on this thing? Come on!

02:20:26.273 --> 02:20:29.462
Let's just keep going and turn a blind eye.

02:20:29.462 --> 02:20:31.526
TALIESIN: Is the cage locked, or is it just shut?

02:20:31.526 --> 02:20:33.572
MATT: From this distance, it looks closed.

02:20:33.572 --> 02:20:38.201
SAM: If you rescue this thing,
could it be cute ever?

02:20:38.202 --> 02:20:40.745
MATT: With a little TLC, maybe.

02:20:40.745 --> 02:20:44.076
LAURA: I mean, we shouldn't let it just die.

02:20:44.076 --> 02:20:46.714
MATT: You're not even sure what kind of
creature it is. It kind of resembles

02:20:46.714 --> 02:20:52.678
a squirrel, kind of resembles a small dog,
but it's greasy and ratty and--

02:20:52.678 --> 02:20:54.340
SAM: Trade your dog for it.

02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:55.933
LAURA: I'm not going to trade Nugget, no!

02:20:55.933 --> 02:20:57.223
SAM: Just trade Nugget for it.

02:20:57.223 --> 02:20:58.067
LAURA: No.

02:20:58.068 --> 02:21:00.215
TALIESIN: Are we going to be walking
within 30 feet of that cage?

02:21:00.215 --> 02:21:01.823
MATT: Most likely, yeah.

02:21:01.823 --> 02:21:03.622
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

02:21:03.622 --> 02:21:10.412
LIAM: I tell you what. Do you want this creature?

02:21:10.412 --> 02:21:14.148
LAURA: I mean, I don't want it to
suffer in a cage, Caleb.

02:21:14.149 --> 02:21:21.097
LIAM: I will make one last offering to you.
I will give you the Fey King,

02:21:21.097 --> 02:21:24.557
in exchange for this creature here.

02:21:24.558 --> 02:21:26.392
SAM: The cat? No, you can't!

02:21:26.392 --> 02:21:27.768
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:21:27.768 --> 02:21:30.783
TRAVIS: I know where you're going with this.
This is going to backfire.

02:21:30.784 --> 02:21:33.591
LIAM: Deception, you said?

02:21:33.591 --> 02:21:34.428
MATT: Yes.

02:21:34.428 --> 02:21:35.370
LIAM: 16.

02:21:35.371 --> 02:21:41.446
MATT: 16? "You can give Fey King?"

02:21:41.446 --> 02:21:45.905
LIAM: He will bring blessings to your people.

02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:49.404
MATT: "Take food, keep king."

02:21:49.404 --> 02:22:04.426
LIAM: Okay. Take the f-- okay. Telepathically, I
tell Frumpkin: I'll bring you back in one day,

02:22:04.426 --> 02:22:09.247
buddy. In my head, and he trods forward.

02:22:09.247 --> 02:22:21.721
MATT: Okay, picks up the Fey King from the scruff
of the neck and goes, "You I eat. Gain power.

02:22:21.898 --> 02:22:24.660
"Bigger than that one. False leader."

02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:28.397
MATT and LAURA: (snarling)

02:22:28.398 --> 02:22:34.294
MATT: "Let go!" All of them pull back and begin to
disappear into the tunnels behind, and you guys

02:22:34.294 --> 02:22:35.647
are given a path through.

02:22:35.648 --> 02:22:38.554
LIAM: We have food, the creature in the cage?

02:22:38.554 --> 02:22:40.046
MATT: The cage is just right there.

02:22:40.046 --> 02:22:40.886
LIAM: I pick it up.

02:22:40.886 --> 02:22:41.956
LAURA: Let's open it up.

02:22:41.956 --> 02:22:43.744
SAM and MARISHA: Take the whole cage.

02:22:43.744 --> 02:22:46.568
TALIESIN: Once the cage is within 30 feet, I'm
just going to pop it open with Thaumaturgy.

02:22:46.568 --> 02:22:51.292
MATT: Okay, the creature immediately jumps out
(shrieks), and darts off down the tunnel.

02:22:51.292 --> 02:22:53.620
MARISHA: Ah, it's rabies.

02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:56.285
LAURA: Yay, it's alive. Thanks, Caleb!

02:22:56.285 --> 02:22:58.024
TALIESIN: Bye, buddy.

02:22:58.025 --> 02:23:01.897
MARISHA: The thing is going to die in ten more
feet from something else.

02:23:01.897 --> 02:23:03.584
TALIESIN: It's going to be like one of those
YouTube videos, where they

02:23:03.584 --> 02:23:06.968
let the mouse go in the forest
and just the hawk-- like ten feet.

02:23:06.968 --> 02:23:08.975
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:23:08.975 --> 02:23:10.443
MATT: You guys continue on the path?

02:23:10.443 --> 02:23:11.541
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:23:11.541 --> 02:23:12.848
TALIESIN: It didn't last one day.

02:23:12.848 --> 02:23:16.049
MATT: As you're leaving, Caduceus, you notice,
that the leader leans over to two other kobolds,

02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:18.650
and whispers something to them.

02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:20.263
TALIESIN: What do I hear?

02:23:20.263 --> 02:23:24.684
MATT: You hear a low muttering, but
not in a language you understand.

02:23:24.684 --> 02:23:32.759
TALIESIN: That's interesting. Can your cat
hear what they're talking about?

02:23:32.759 --> 02:23:36.957
LIAM: Sure, but I'm not zooming
into him right now.

02:23:36.957 --> 02:23:40.966
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to walk by you and
be like: They're talking about something.

02:23:40.966 --> 02:23:43.700
I don't know if we want to keep an ear out
for what they're up to.

02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:46.053
LIAM: (swoosh)

02:23:46.053 --> 02:23:47.816
MATT: So what was that?

02:23:47.816 --> 02:23:51.651
LIAM: Oh, I just jumped into the Fey King really
quick to see if anything was happening.

02:23:51.651 --> 02:23:55.902
MATT: Okay, after you guys leave, everyone
scatters into the chambers, but stays behind

02:23:55.902 --> 02:24:03.369
and watches, and two of the kobolds slowly begin
to follow behind the group in the tunnel after you.

02:24:03.369 --> 02:24:04.867
LAURA: Yeah.

02:24:04.867 --> 02:24:06.558
TALIESIN: Cool.

02:24:06.559 --> 02:24:09.171
MARISHA: Let's let them do it for a little bit.

02:24:09.171 --> 02:24:14.776
MATT: One of them is the one that's covered in all
the different boxes and pouches.

02:24:14.776 --> 02:24:20.695
There's a staff and it has an actual small cage,
like the one that you just opened, on its side

02:24:20.695 --> 02:24:25.439
with something inside it. The other one just
looks to be a small spear-holding scout

02:24:25.439 --> 02:24:30.451
and they're both being quiet as they can, but
the one carrying everything isn't very quiet.

02:24:30.451 --> 02:24:33.045
SAM: They're on our tail?

02:24:33.045 --> 02:24:38.447
MATT: Caduceus, you can hear the gentle
clanging of various accessories of this kobold

02:24:38.447 --> 02:24:41.477
trying to be quiet, pursuing you down the tunnel.

02:24:41.477 --> 02:24:44.649
TALIESIN: As long as they're
keeping some distance.

02:24:44.649 --> 02:24:47.797
SAM: Want me to take them out? Or at least--

02:24:47.797 --> 02:24:48.898
TALIESIN: Not yet.

02:24:48.898 --> 02:24:50.072
SAM: Disarm them?

02:24:50.072 --> 02:24:52.321
LIAM: Let's lead them away from the pack.

02:24:52.321 --> 02:24:55.205
MARISHA: They might have useful information.

02:24:55.205 --> 02:24:59.638
LAURA: They're so cute.

02:24:59.638 --> 02:25:02.446
TRAVIS: I don't think that's accurate.

02:25:02.446 --> 02:25:04.363
SAM: They both have weapons?

02:25:04.364 --> 02:25:06.523
MATT: Well, one of them is just covered in--

02:25:06.523 --> 02:25:07.262
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:25:07.262 --> 02:25:11.944
MATT: --random shit. The other one has a spear.
You travel for about an hour or so, away from

02:25:11.944 --> 02:25:18.477
that, the tunnel continuing before you. They're
still staying back by about 60 or so feet.

02:25:18.477 --> 02:25:21.315
MARISHA: Oh, so they're not even
being secretive about it.

02:25:21.315 --> 02:25:24.041
MATT and MARISHA: They think they are.

02:25:24.041 --> 02:25:26.136
TRAVIS: They're watching us leave.
They're escorting us out.

02:25:26.136 --> 02:25:27.176
MARISHA: Got it.

02:25:27.176 --> 02:25:30.588
TALIESIN: I think at some point-- When's
the point where it's time to bed down?

02:25:30.588 --> 02:25:32.473
Are we getting to that point?

02:25:32.473 --> 02:25:34.985
MATT: I'd say you're probably within
another hour or so of that.

02:25:34.985 --> 02:25:37.936
TALIESIN: I think at some point
we're going to "bed down."

02:25:37.936 --> 02:25:39.394
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:25:39.394 --> 02:25:44.867
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:25:44.867 --> 02:25:47.207
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

02:25:47.207 --> 02:25:48.901
LAURA: Yeah, and then we'll go to sleep?

02:25:48.901 --> 02:25:50.557
TALIESIN: And then we'll go to sleep.

02:25:50.557 --> 02:25:51.874
SAM: "Go to sleep."

02:25:51.874 --> 02:25:56.553
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Good idea.

02:25:56.553 --> 02:26:02.589
MATT: All right. So you guys eventually reach that
point and you begin to bed down. What do you do?

02:26:02.589 --> 02:26:06.961
TALIESIN: I'm just going to-- I think we should--

02:26:06.962 --> 02:26:09.857
LAURA: Put on a show. I think
they need some entertainment.

02:26:09.857 --> 02:26:11.669
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:26:11.669 --> 02:26:12.688
LAURA: Yeah.

02:26:12.688 --> 02:26:18.795
MARISHA: You mean like as in: (projecting)
Hey! We should go to sleep! Like that?

02:26:18.795 --> 02:26:22.611
LAURA: Yes! Oh, I'm feeling so tired.

02:26:22.611 --> 02:26:25.146
MARISHA: My feet, they hurt.

02:26:25.146 --> 02:26:30.958
LAURA: Also, I'm not a giant lizard anymore.
I'm not a big kobold. I'm me again.

02:26:30.958 --> 02:26:33.397
MARISHA: Because you're a god!

02:26:33.397 --> 02:26:36.366
LAURA: That's right, I can take any form I want.

02:26:36.366 --> 02:26:39.575
MARISHA: I'm glad to see your
true form, mistress!

02:26:39.576 --> 02:26:43.865
LAURA: Yes! I'm glad everyone worships me
like they should.

02:26:43.865 --> 02:26:49.228
SAM: While they're shouting at each other,
I'm going to turn invisible.

02:26:49.229 --> 02:26:50.576
MATT: Okay.

02:26:50.576 --> 02:26:51.455
TRAVIS: There you go.

02:26:51.455 --> 02:26:53.124
SAM: And I'm going to sneak back there.

02:26:53.124 --> 02:26:53.958
MATT: Okay.

02:26:53.958 --> 02:26:55.697
SAM: Back towards them.

02:26:55.697 --> 02:26:59.594
MATT: Do you guys... lay down?
What do you do?

02:26:59.594 --> 02:27:03.204
LAURA: I walk around dramatically for a while.

02:27:03.204 --> 02:27:06.255
TRAVIS: Is the dome out?
Are we summoning the whole thing?

02:27:06.256 --> 02:27:07.835
MATT: Is the dome out or are you waiting?

02:27:07.835 --> 02:27:09.732
LIAM: I have not done that yet--

02:27:09.732 --> 02:27:13.853
MARISHA: I'll try to look for firewood,
but I'm so exhausted.

02:27:13.854 --> 02:27:17.882
LAURA: It's going to be so hard to find
wood down here in the tunnels.

02:27:17.882 --> 02:27:20.581
LIAM: Point of clarification: are we travelling
through worm tunnel at this point?

02:27:20.581 --> 02:27:21.678
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:27:21.678 --> 02:27:23.209
LIAM: Okay. Which is how wide again, ten--?

02:27:23.209 --> 02:27:23.922
MATT: Ten feet.

02:27:23.922 --> 02:27:24.554
LIAM: Ten feet across.

02:27:24.554 --> 02:27:25.206
MATT: Always been ten feet.

02:27:25.206 --> 02:27:27.033
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, thank you.

02:27:27.034 --> 02:27:31.386
TRAVIS: I'm sitting cross-legged
on the floor, staring at the dirt.

02:27:31.386 --> 02:27:33.840
LIAM: I don't think we need to pull up
the dome right now.

02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:34.854
LAURA: Not yet, no.

02:27:34.855 --> 02:27:35.638
MARISHA: No.

02:27:35.638 --> 02:27:37.095
MATT: Okay. You guys--

02:27:37.095 --> 02:27:38.646
SAM: Am I nearing them?

02:27:38.646 --> 02:27:42.532
MATT: As you're invisible-- are you walking
back towards their direction?

02:27:42.532 --> 02:27:43.443
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:27:43.443 --> 02:27:48.284
MATT: Okay. You see the two of them, around the
bend, are both looking and the one with the spear

02:27:48.284 --> 02:27:52.118
is looking kind of eager. The one with all the
shit on it is looking a little apprehensive

02:27:52.118 --> 02:27:58.549
and they're both just watching and talking
back and forth. (kobold speech)

02:27:58.549 --> 02:28:00.383
LIAM: Is Nott out of our sight?

02:28:00.383 --> 02:28:02.378
MATT: Yeah. Nott vanished a few minutes ago.

02:28:02.379 --> 02:28:04.846
SAM: I'm going to try to sneak up
on the one with the spear.

02:28:04.846 --> 02:28:06.489
MATT: All right.

02:28:06.489 --> 02:28:13.143
SAM: And get close to he or she
and grab the spear out of their hand.

02:28:13.143 --> 02:28:17.983
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a...
I would say, with advantage,

02:28:17.983 --> 02:28:21.374
make an athletics check to try and--

02:28:25.805 --> 02:28:26.491
SAM: 20.

02:28:26.491 --> 02:28:31.665
MATT: Seven. The spear vanishes from its hand.

02:28:31.665 --> 02:28:36.139
SAM: I'll throw it the opposite direction
down the tunnel away from us.

02:28:36.139 --> 02:28:45.457
MATT: (confused kobold noises) He looks confused
and rubs his wrist and starts walking

02:28:45.457 --> 02:28:49.509
back towards the spear on the opposite side.

02:28:49.509 --> 02:28:58.968
SAM: Then while he or she is going to get their
spear, I'm going to try and grapple the weird one.

02:28:58.968 --> 02:29:01.912
The one that's all weird and shit.

02:29:01.912 --> 02:29:05.838
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

02:29:05.838 --> 02:29:07.458
SAM: Oh, not advantage.

02:29:07.459 --> 02:29:10.941
MATT: I would say advantage because it doesn't
know you're there. I'll allow it. It's fine.

02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:12.555
SAM: Okay. 19.

02:29:12.555 --> 02:29:18.287
MATT: 19. Okay. If you'd like to
describe your kobold.

02:29:18.287 --> 02:29:23.597
(yells of surprise and disbelief)

02:29:23.597 --> 02:29:27.843
TRAVIS: You son of a bitch! You slow-playing
son of a bitch.

02:29:27.844 --> 02:29:32.336
LIAM: Playing the long game. The long con!

02:29:32.336 --> 02:29:33.710
MATT: Move over, Taliesin.

02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:35.618
TALIESIN: Oh, am I moving over? Okay.

02:29:35.618 --> 02:29:38.430
(pandemonium)

02:29:38.430 --> 02:29:40.402
LIAM: Oh my god! Long con!

02:29:40.402 --> 02:29:43.867
TRAVIS: That was good.
That was some bullshit.

02:29:43.867 --> 02:29:47.206
TALIESIN: Holy shit.

02:29:47.206 --> 02:29:49.751
MATT: There we go.

02:29:49.751 --> 02:29:51.153
TALIESIN: I'm going to make some room here.

02:29:51.153 --> 02:29:51.829
MATT: Welcome, Chris.

02:29:51.829 --> 02:29:53.226
CHRIS: Thank you very much!

02:29:53.227 --> 02:29:55.779
SAM: What?! We were specifically told...

02:29:55.779 --> 02:29:58.313
TRAVIS: Not playing.

02:29:58.313 --> 02:30:00.714
ALL: Not playing!

02:30:00.714 --> 02:30:02.169
MARISHA: Just visiting!

02:30:02.169 --> 02:30:03.970
CHRIS: This is a house of lies!

02:30:03.971 --> 02:30:06.663
(laughter)

02:30:06.663 --> 02:30:08.433
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

02:30:08.433 --> 02:30:09.702
CHRIS: No peeking.

02:30:09.702 --> 02:30:11.119
TALIESIN: No peeking.

02:30:11.119 --> 02:30:17.129
MATT: So. Suddenly, out of nowhere, apparates
in the nervous energy of the moment

02:30:17.129 --> 02:30:22.204
the small goblin creature that you've
been eyeing nervously as the group

02:30:22.204 --> 02:30:26.564
wandered through, and it just reaches out
and grabs a hold of you.

02:30:26.564 --> 02:30:29.178
CHRIS: Ah! Mommy! Mommy!

02:30:29.178 --> 02:30:32.696
SAM: Yeah, I am your mommy!
Yeah! Deal with it!

02:30:34.187 --> 02:30:44.149
CHRIS: So this kobold has... he's got flasks
hanging off him by ropes and you can see

02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:49.398
that these flasks are basically just
stoppered gourds and they're clattering

02:30:49.398 --> 02:30:58.701
and banging together. He's got a basket of
swarming centipedes slung over his back.

02:30:58.701 --> 02:30:59.771
SAM: Open?

02:30:59.771 --> 02:31:02.977
CHRIS: No, it's also closed off, almost
like a closed off net of centipedes.

02:31:02.977 --> 02:31:03.725
SAM: Ugh.

02:31:03.725 --> 02:31:05.092
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:31:05.092 --> 02:31:11.556
CHRIS: With a rope attached to it. And then
there is a clay pot hanging from that,

02:31:11.556 --> 02:31:20.410
that has an acrid smell rising from it and
another clay pot tied to a rope that's lashed

02:31:20.410 --> 02:31:29.785
around his shoulders. His weapon is a staff
with a living scorpion tied at the top of it.

02:31:29.785 --> 02:31:32.097
SAM: Caduceus, where are you when I need you?

02:31:32.097 --> 02:31:38.683
CHRIS: Its little tail jabbing at the air.
And the cage holds a creature

02:31:38.684 --> 02:31:41.947
that you recognise as a skunk.

02:31:43.656 --> 02:31:44.932
TRAVIS: This fucking--

02:31:44.932 --> 02:31:46.392
TALIESIN: This is chemical warfare, man.

02:31:46.392 --> 02:32:00.991
CHRIS: The worst is, tied to this stick with
the scorpion on it is a bag that is buzzing

02:32:00.991 --> 02:32:03.224
loudly like it's full of hornets.

02:32:03.224 --> 02:32:04.433
SAM: Hey, bees.

02:32:04.434 --> 02:32:06.791
LAURA: Hey, bees!

02:32:06.791 --> 02:32:12.436
MATT: So as you hear this sudden clattering
commotion, and both this kobold voice

02:32:12.436 --> 02:32:18.796
screaming out, "Mommy!" and Nott going, "Yeah,
mommy!" the other kobold down the way goes,

02:32:18.796 --> 02:32:22.047
(panicked kobold yelling) and runs off to grab
the spear, you guys hear this noise.

02:32:22.047 --> 02:32:23.446
What are you two doing?

02:32:23.446 --> 02:32:26.076
SAM: I'm going to-- Oh, you two
meaning me and Chris?

02:32:26.077 --> 02:32:27.791
MATT: Yeah. What's your reaction.

02:32:27.791 --> 02:32:31.054
CHRIS: I am trying to take my stick
and hit him with the scorpion.

02:32:31.054 --> 02:32:34.056
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack.

02:32:34.056 --> 02:32:36.770
TRAVIS: Little scorpion on the end of the stick?

02:32:36.770 --> 02:32:38.969
CHRIS: Little scorpion.

02:32:38.969 --> 02:32:40.968
TRAVIS: Please hit.

02:32:40.968 --> 02:32:42.689
CHRIS: That is a-- What is that?

02:32:42.689 --> 02:32:44.092
TALIESIN: That, I believe, is in fact a--

02:32:44.092 --> 02:32:44.868
LAURA: A natural 20?

02:32:44.868 --> 02:32:46.164
TALIESIN: I think that's a natural 20.

02:32:46.164 --> 02:32:50.341
(laughter)

02:32:50.341 --> 02:32:56.836
TALIESIN: Yeah, that is! That's your old Keyleth
die, too. I've never seen it roll one in my life.

02:32:56.836 --> 02:32:59.502
CHRIS: So it stings you on your eyelid. (Pfff!)

02:32:59.502 --> 02:33:00.693
SAM: Ah!

02:33:00.693 --> 02:33:04.091
TRAVIS: Yeah, best place.

02:33:04.091 --> 02:33:08.515
CHRIS: You take one piercing damage and
have to make a constitution saving throw.

02:33:08.516 --> 02:33:10.639
MATT: So two piercing damage with the crit.

02:33:10.639 --> 02:33:12.485
CHRIS: Oh. Sure, I like it. Yeah; two.

02:33:12.485 --> 02:33:13.802
SAM: Con save? 21.

02:33:13.802 --> 02:33:19.795
CHRIS: Okay. You succeed and take half
of this amount of damage. Which is...

02:33:19.795 --> 02:33:22.100
LIAM: 79.

02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:24.836
MATT: Technically, the dice damage is doubled
because it's a crit too. So it's just straight damage.

02:33:24.837 --> 02:33:29.431
CHRIS: Oh, right yeah! Double poison damage, shit.
So that will be seven points of poison damage on you.

02:33:29.431 --> 02:33:36.551
MATT: The eye immediately swells up from
the impact and you're like, "Ah!"

02:33:36.551 --> 02:33:41.148
Just spinning around in a circle. The one
with the spear rushes up like, "Ergh!"

02:33:41.148 --> 02:33:43.714
Can't quite figure out where to go.
What are you guys doing?

02:33:43.714 --> 02:33:44.834
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up.

02:33:44.835 --> 02:33:46.125
LIAM: Walking towards the noise, &lt;i&gt;ja&lt;/i&gt;.

02:33:46.125 --> 02:33:48.099
SAM: I've got one!

02:33:48.099 --> 02:33:55.342
MATT: You rush around the corner and you see this
whirling whirlwind of clattering pots and cage and

02:33:55.342 --> 02:34:00.343
goblin and kobold screaming. Anyone doing
anything or are you just watching?

02:34:00.343 --> 02:34:02.439
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command.

02:34:02.439 --> 02:34:03.806
MATT: All right.

02:34:03.806 --> 02:34:14.566
LAURA: At second le-- no. Yeah, second level.
And try to get both of them and say, Stop it!

02:34:14.566 --> 02:34:16.532
SAM: You're commanding me too?

02:34:16.532 --> 02:34:18.990
LAURA: No, both of the...

02:34:18.990 --> 02:34:20.574
MATT: Gotcha.

02:34:20.575 --> 02:34:25.470
LIAM: The second one ran off down the hall a bit.

02:34:25.470 --> 02:34:27.278
LAURA: Yeah, but it's still within range.

02:34:27.278 --> 02:34:28.697
MATT: All right. So it's wisdom saving throws?

02:34:28.697 --> 02:34:29.970
LAURA: Yes, wisdom saving throw.

02:34:29.971 --> 02:34:31.956
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw,
if you don't mind.

02:34:31.956 --> 02:34:35.597
LIAM: And simultaneously, I am casting
Enlarge on Nott the Brave.

02:34:35.597 --> 02:34:40.552
MATT: Okay. So--

02:34:40.552 --> 02:34:43.060
CHRIS: I rolled a 14 minus two is 12.

02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:46.330
MATT: 12. 17 minus two which is 15.

02:34:46.330 --> 02:34:48.173
LAURA: They both have to stop it!

02:34:48.174 --> 02:34:52.003
MATT: So immediately, the one holding the
spear looks at you, "Huh!" And you find yourself

02:34:52.003 --> 02:34:56.445
all of a sudden stop struggling and weapon
freezes in place. At the same time, the tiny

02:34:56.445 --> 02:35:01.432
goblin arms around you suddenly Hulk out
and you find yourself lifted off the ground,

02:35:01.433 --> 02:35:05.278
your legs dangling a few inches off
the floor of the cavern.

02:35:05.278 --> 02:35:08.452
SAM: Don't make mommy (much deeper) mad!

02:35:08.452 --> 02:35:11.857
(laughter)

02:35:11.857 --> 02:35:16.254
TALIESIN: Aww, come on.

02:35:16.255 --> 02:35:18.356
LAURA: I mean...

02:35:18.356 --> 02:35:20.984
SAM: Who are you?
(deeper) What do you want?

02:35:20.984 --> 02:35:22.811
CHRIS: I'm Spurt!

02:35:22.811 --> 02:35:24.765
TRAVIS, MARISHA, SAM: Spurt?!

02:35:24.766 --> 02:35:26.337
MATT: "I'm Bex."

02:35:26.337 --> 02:35:28.313
LAURA: Spurt and Bex?

02:35:28.313 --> 02:35:30.724
MATT: "Yeah."

02:35:30.724 --> 02:35:34.690
CHRIS: We're supposed to follow you
to make sure you don't drop any food!

02:35:34.690 --> 02:35:40.268
LAURA: Oh. We don't have any food.
We already gave you all the food.

02:35:40.268 --> 02:35:43.548
MATT: "Oh! (sigh)"

02:35:43.548 --> 02:35:47.953
CHRIS: Also, I'm supposed to stick a bunch of rock
grubs in your mouth while you're sleeping!

02:35:47.953 --> 02:35:50.255
SAM: What? Stick a bunch of what?

02:35:50.255 --> 02:35:52.309
MATT: "Don't have to tell them this."

02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:53.811
CHRIS: He's really big!

02:35:53.811 --> 02:35:58.762
MATT: "Okay. Sorry!"

02:35:58.763 --> 02:36:02.182
LAURA: You guys, what the fuck are you doing?

02:36:02.182 --> 02:36:04.047
TALIESIN: I mean, I just feel bad, really,
at this point.

02:36:04.047 --> 02:36:08.664
LAURA: You're so cute and stuff but like,
don't attack us; we're really big.

02:36:08.664 --> 02:36:10.655
TRAVIS: Jester, you killing them or what?

02:36:10.655 --> 02:36:12.285
LAURA: Yeah, no I'm going to kill them.

02:36:12.285 --> 02:36:14.311
MATT: (scared kobold noises)

02:36:14.311 --> 02:36:15.949
LAURA: (whispered) I'm not going
to kill you, don't worry.

02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:16.512
SAM: Run.

02:36:16.512 --> 02:36:18.976
CHRIS: If you let us go, I'll let you
play with our centipault.

02:36:18.976 --> 02:36:20.347
LAURA: What's a centipault?

02:36:20.347 --> 02:36:22.193
MARISHA: I'm interested.

02:36:22.194 --> 02:36:24.870
TRAVIS: You don't want to play with that.

02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:27.326
TALIESIN: No, I feel like we should
hear this out.

02:36:27.431 --> 02:36:29.604
SAM: Your centipault?

02:36:29.604 --> 02:36:31.878
CHRIS: Yeah. It's an invention.

02:36:31.878 --> 02:36:34.573
SAM: What does it do?

02:36:35.321 --> 02:36:37.535
CHRIS: It throws centipedes real far.

02:36:37.535 --> 02:36:39.468
LAURA: That's awesome!

02:36:39.892 --> 02:36:45.503
LIAM: Show us a demonstration and we will
induct you to the Mighty Nein.

02:36:45.697 --> 02:36:47.688
CHRIS: Tell mommy to let me go.

02:36:47.688 --> 02:36:49.975
TALIESIN: Um... well...

02:36:49.975 --> 02:36:51.336
SAM: All right.

02:36:51.337 --> 02:36:52.351
TALIESIN: Mommy?

02:36:53.361 --> 02:36:55.491
SAM: Show us the centipault.

02:36:56.572 --> 02:36:59.920
LAURA: But not on us.
Don't attack us, okay?

02:37:00.331 --> 02:37:02.490
MATT: There's only one other target
in the chamber.

02:37:02.490 --> 02:37:07.229
CHRIS: All right. Yes, exactly. So I will take off
my green slime pot, and I will take off my rock

02:37:07.230 --> 02:37:12.262
grub pot, and I'll lay down my scorpion stick, and
my skunk in a cage, and my wasp in a bag.

02:37:13.603 --> 02:37:15.483
TALIESIN: I like it.

02:37:15.657 --> 02:37:20.181
CHRIS: And then I will begin assembling my
centipault out of other oddities that I have on me.

02:37:20.181 --> 02:37:24.264
LAURA: I'm going to open my sketchbook
and draw all of it.

02:37:24.264 --> 02:37:26.721
MATT: Learning the cutting-edge
kobold technology.

02:37:26.721 --> 02:37:30.810
SAM: Maybe we should set up some sort of
target for the young man.

02:37:30.810 --> 02:37:33.024
CHRIS: I'll use him.

02:37:33.024 --> 02:37:34.276
TRAVIS: What'd he say?

02:37:34.276 --> 02:37:36.939
SAM: He's going to shoot centipedes at you.

02:37:36.939 --> 02:37:38.970
LAURA: Don't worry, we'll heal you.

02:37:39.072 --> 02:37:41.282
TRAVIS: Sounded like there's something that
shoots centipedes on me.

02:37:41.283 --> 02:37:42.461
MARISHA: No, that's exactly what he said.

02:37:42.461 --> 02:37:44.719
CHRIS: Then you hear this sound: (pthwoing).

02:37:44.719 --> 02:37:47.205
MARISHA: Do you have bug allergies? Oh, no.

02:37:47.205 --> 02:37:53.021
TRAVIS: (panicked screaming)

02:37:53.605 --> 02:37:54.863
MARISHA: Have you been stung?

02:37:54.863 --> 02:37:56.991
LIAM: Leeches!

02:37:57.364 --> 02:37:59.230
MATT: Fjord just comes running down the hallway.

02:37:59.230 --> 02:38:00.946
TRAVIS: (screaming)

02:38:00.946 --> 02:38:04.255
MATT: The kobold in right in front of you goes,
"Ah!" Just screams at you as you slam into it.

02:38:04.256 --> 02:38:06.499
The spear goes clattering to the ground.

02:38:06.499 --> 02:38:07.947
TALIESIN: That's really neat.

02:38:07.947 --> 02:38:10.009
LAURA: That's really cool.

02:38:10.009 --> 02:38:12.794
MARISHA: It works! It's amazing.

02:38:12.794 --> 02:38:14.037
TALIESIN: Aw man.

02:38:14.037 --> 02:38:15.993
SAM: That's ingenious.

02:38:15.993 --> 02:38:19.302
MATT: At which point, the Enlarge spell fades.
(whoosh)

02:38:20.163 --> 02:38:23.008
TRAVIS: That was fucking terrible.

02:38:23.008 --> 02:38:26.914
CHRIS: Want to see my skunk?
I hold it up by the tail.

02:38:26.914 --> 02:38:29.093
TRAVIS: Oh, no!

02:38:29.093 --> 02:38:30.096
LAURA: Is it alive?

02:38:30.096 --> 02:38:31.217
CHRIS: Oh, yeah.

02:38:31.217 --> 02:38:32.944
TALIESIN: Hey, hi. How's it going?

02:38:32.944 --> 02:38:38.599
MATT: As he holds up the skunk, the nervous energy
around it, the skunk just instinctually-- (snarl)

02:38:38.599 --> 02:38:39.445
LAURA: No!

02:38:39.445 --> 02:38:40.443
MATT: (spray)

02:38:40.444 --> 02:38:42.186
TRAVIS, MARISHA: (groans)

02:38:42.186 --> 02:38:44.052
MATT: Dexterity saving throw for Jester and Nott.

02:38:44.577 --> 02:38:45.951
LAURA: Ugh!

02:38:47.331 --> 02:38:48.424
TALIESIN: Great!

02:38:48.424 --> 02:38:49.215
LIAM: Come on.

02:38:49.215 --> 02:38:50.323
MARISHA: Dodge those juices.

02:38:50.323 --> 02:38:51.046
LIAM: No.

02:38:51.046 --> 02:38:51.966
SAM: 18.

02:38:51.966 --> 02:38:52.863
LAURA: 15.

02:38:52.863 --> 02:38:53.895
LIAM: Damn it!

02:38:53.895 --> 02:38:57.363
MATT: All right. You manage to just barely
escape out of the way as it--

02:38:57.717 --> 02:38:59.366
CHRIS: No! Bad, Pepé! Bad!

02:38:59.366 --> 02:39:00.936
(laughter)

02:39:00.936 --> 02:39:03.003
MATT: (skunk noises)

02:39:03.004 --> 02:39:04.750
CHRIS: I beat it with my stick.

02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:05.938
MATT: Okay.

02:39:05.938 --> 02:39:10.158
LAURA: No, don't beat it! Poor Pepé.

02:39:10.543 --> 02:39:17.085
MATT: The other kobold has fled. It saw the
running Fjord centipede nightmare and just left.

02:39:17.456 --> 02:39:22.879
TRAVIS: As fun as that was, you know,
instead of killing this adorable little guy,

02:39:22.879 --> 02:39:27.765
maybe we could enlist him as a scout or guide?

02:39:28.007 --> 02:39:33.394
SAM: Do you know these tunnels at all? Have you
explored since the worm came through?

02:39:33.394 --> 02:39:34.827
CHRIS: Yeah!

02:39:35.358 --> 02:39:38.093
SAM: What was that? What did you just do?

02:39:38.093 --> 02:39:40.129
MATT: Still hitting the skunk.

02:39:40.949 --> 02:39:43.406
TRAVIS: Stop! No, hey, hey!

02:39:43.909 --> 02:39:45.347
LAURA: Stop hitting it.

02:39:45.347 --> 02:39:47.652
SAM: Don't beat your skunk.

02:39:47.949 --> 02:39:49.458
CHRIS: I put it back in its box.

02:39:49.458 --> 02:39:53.097
LIAM: Yeah, I have a question for you,
my little friend. Do you eat enough

02:39:53.097 --> 02:39:55.762
under your current leadership?

02:39:57.113 --> 02:39:58.314
CHRIS: No!

02:39:58.512 --> 02:40:06.021
LIAM: We will keep your belly full. If you travel
with us, you will have never eaten so much

02:40:06.021 --> 02:40:12.508
in your life. But we do need a guide
down here, and you could be that guide.

02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:20.699
CHRIS: (shouting) I'm very quiet! Tie off
the cage, sling it over my hornets,

02:40:20.699 --> 02:40:24.452
tie them back to my staff.

02:40:24.452 --> 02:40:28.519
TALIESIN: If it gets us to where we need to be,
I'd be willing to drop another spell.

02:40:30.269 --> 02:40:31.387
LAURA: Yeah.

02:40:32.374 --> 02:40:38.898
TALIESIN: Another 45 pounds, whatever we don't
need of that 45 pounds, which is an awful lot of food.

02:40:38.899 --> 02:40:43.681
TRAVIS: I think you'll have no trouble finding
your way back. How far down this tunnel

02:40:43.681 --> 02:40:47.719
have you ventured before, Spurt?

02:40:48.047 --> 02:40:50.881
CHRIS: I point back the way we came
about 60 feet.

02:40:50.882 --> 02:40:54.574
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Brave new world.

02:40:54.574 --> 02:40:57.689
LIAM: Oh. That is less appealing.

02:40:58.075 --> 02:41:03.086
SAM: But you're quiet and you can stealth, right?
You snuck up on us very well.

02:41:03.086 --> 02:41:05.817
TALIESIN: Is that a bag of bees you've got
over there?

02:41:05.817 --> 02:41:07.544
LAURA: Oh hello, bees!

02:41:07.544 --> 02:41:10.055
CHRIS: I've got plus zero, is that high?

02:41:10.514 --> 02:41:11.726
SAM: Sure.

02:41:12.066 --> 02:41:13.638
CHRIS: Here are my bees.

02:41:14.318 --> 02:41:16.076
TALIESIN and LAURA: Hi, bees.

02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:19.413
LIAM: Not the bees. Not the bees.

02:41:19.413 --> 02:41:23.140
LAURA: Hey Spurt, how long have you lived down
here?

02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:25.315
CHRIS: 11 days!

02:41:25.315 --> 02:41:26.668
LAURA: 11 days?

02:41:26.668 --> 02:41:28.460
SAM: How long do kobolds live?

02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:29.875
CHRIS: 11 days!

02:41:29.875 --> 02:41:31.656
(laughter)

02:41:31.656 --> 02:41:33.943
TRAVIS: Oh god, this is it! The swan song!

02:41:34.083 --> 02:41:38.665
LIAM: And in your 11 days, what is the worst thing
you have ever seen down here?

02:41:39.797 --> 02:41:42.823
CHRIS: My brother got eaten by a green slime.

02:41:42.823 --> 02:41:45.880
MARISHA: Wait, like the green slime you have
right there in the--

02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:47.124
CHRIS: Yeah, that's the one!

02:41:47.124 --> 02:41:48.206
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

02:41:48.206 --> 02:41:50.505
(laughter)

02:41:53.654 --> 02:41:55.203
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:41:57.209 --> 02:42:01.485
SAM: Do you like it down here?
Do you want to come with us?

02:42:01.485 --> 02:42:03.017
CHRIS: Where else is there?

02:42:03.017 --> 02:42:04.198
SAM: There's other places.

02:42:04.198 --> 02:42:05.564
CHRIS: Really?

02:42:05.564 --> 02:42:11.256
SAM: Yes. There's light and other terrain.

02:42:11.257 --> 02:42:14.908
MARISHA: Would you like to follow us towards
the light at the end of the tunnel?

02:42:16.852 --> 02:42:18.745
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

02:42:18.745 --> 02:42:20.318
CHRIS: Okay!

02:42:20.318 --> 02:42:23.043
LAURA: Except we're leading him to
a really scary place, y'all.

02:42:23.043 --> 02:42:27.838
SAM: We don't know that. We don't know,
Xhorhas might love kobolds.

02:42:31.658 --> 02:42:36.370
LIAM: Plus he's near the end of his life.
We might as well show him great things,

02:42:36.394 --> 02:42:42.371
going to eat better than he ever has.
We could let him look at the dodecahedron.

02:42:42.371 --> 02:42:45.892
LAURA: We shouldn't pull that shit out.

02:42:45.892 --> 02:42:50.458
LIAM: Or leave it in the bag. I'm just
kidding, forget it. That's a bad idea.

02:42:50.458 --> 02:42:52.535
LAURA: That could be a really bad idea, Caleb.

02:42:52.535 --> 02:42:54.438
LIAM: It's funny, but it's not wise.

02:42:54.438 --> 02:42:55.999
TRAVIS: We should keep going.

02:42:55.999 --> 02:42:57.838
LAURA: Yeah. You want to come with us?

02:42:57.838 --> 02:42:59.144
CHRIS: Yeah!

02:42:59.144 --> 02:43:03.231
LAURA: Hey, this kid thinks you're his mom.

02:43:05.131 --> 02:43:08.182
SAM: That's super duper sad right now.

02:43:09.453 --> 02:43:11.706
TALIESIN: Way to bring the whole room down.

02:43:12.808 --> 02:43:15.578
MARISHA: I'm dying. I am dying.

02:43:17.991 --> 02:43:21.359
LIAM: D&amp;D, happiness and sadness tied together.

02:43:21.518 --> 02:43:24.514
MATT: (laughing) All right, so
what's the marching order?

02:43:24.861 --> 02:43:26.840
SAM: Spurt 30 feet ahead?

02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:28.832
MATT: All right.

02:43:30.313 --> 02:43:33.717
CHRIS: I walk with my staff out so
Stingy is actually in the lead.

02:43:33.717 --> 02:43:41.063
MATT: Got you, so you're leading with your
scorpion, perfect. Spurt continues forward.

02:43:41.063 --> 02:43:42.421
Do you guys follow?

02:43:42.421 --> 02:43:43.684
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:43:43.685 --> 02:43:50.059
MATT: All right. Spurt, roll a
perception check for me.

02:43:50.264 --> 02:43:53.193
CHRIS: Something around here's stinky!

02:43:53.438 --> 02:43:55.969
LIAM: This is the best. This is the best!

02:43:55.969 --> 02:43:57.812
TALIESIN: Wow!

02:43:59.418 --> 02:44:01.660
MATT: (laughing) Okay!

02:44:02.039 --> 02:44:04.698
CHRIS: Hey, it's dark down here!

02:44:08.366 --> 02:44:10.636
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is going to be great.

02:44:10.636 --> 02:44:17.493
TRAVIS: (laughing) "It's dark down here."
Not good, not good.

02:44:17.493 --> 02:44:24.527
MATT: Continuing on for the next few hours,
getting slowly used to the smell of kobold--

02:44:24.527 --> 02:44:31.947
especially a moving-hoarder of a kobold-- the
tunnel continues to curve and it goes down a

02:44:31.947 --> 02:44:38.197
little further, then it evens out and goes down a
little further, then evens out. You get pretty

02:44:38.197 --> 02:44:47.508
late into the day before you begin to notice the
rock and stone having some slight changes.

02:44:47.508 --> 02:44:55.217
The general bits of materials that you've been
used to seeing down here-- the heavy gray and

02:44:55.217 --> 02:45:01.577
brown rocks-- occasionally, you see flecks and
glimmers that your passing light puts

02:45:01.577 --> 02:45:07.865
a shine across. You go over and inspect it
and it is a black, glass-like substance.

02:45:09.528 --> 02:45:10.977
MARISHA: Is it obsidian?

02:45:10.977 --> 02:45:16.585
MATT: It's obsidian. You continue moving forward
and there's more sections of it, and you can see

02:45:16.585 --> 02:45:21.452
where bits of it are broken and flaked off where
the worm was burrowing through and battered

02:45:21.452 --> 02:45:24.953
through a section of obsidian
that then shattered.

02:45:24.953 --> 02:45:27.085
TALIESIN: If there's any way to scoop up
a couple of pieces.

02:45:27.085 --> 02:45:29.826
MATT: Yeah, definitely. You gather up a bunch
of obsidian shards. A lot of it is broken and

02:45:29.826 --> 02:45:35.244
brittle, but there are some larger bits that you
can find that are pretty jagged, really. You see

02:45:35.244 --> 02:45:37.845
them first, so you gather what you want.

02:45:37.845 --> 02:45:40.472
CHRIS: Oh, I'm too busy eating the poop
out of my skunk's cage.

02:45:40.472 --> 02:45:42.020
MATT: There you go.

02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:43.691
MARISHA: Goodberries!

02:45:43.691 --> 02:45:46.913
MATT: Hey, guys, kobolds have ecology down.

02:45:48.833 --> 02:45:50.887
CHRIS: Nothing goes to waste!

02:45:51.672 --> 02:45:53.927
LIAM: It's like a Dune suit, man, you can't let
that shit go to waste.

02:45:53.927 --> 02:45:54.967
MATT: Exactly!

02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:57.501
LIAM: Reduce, reuse, recycle!

02:45:57.840 --> 02:45:59.733
MARISHA: Stop, I just got better.

02:45:59.978 --> 02:46:06.210
MATT: I'm just saying, none of you has a weapon
that feeds you. The air gets steadily warmer and

02:46:06.210 --> 02:46:16.504
warmer as the hours pass, and the floor itself
begins to give way from the softer dirt and dust

02:46:16.504 --> 02:46:23.382
with loose pebbles to become a harder, more porous
rock, and the obsidian begins to become more

02:46:23.382 --> 02:46:33.650
apparent and more consistent. You, Spurt, begin to
see a dull light ahead. A dull, low, red light.

02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:35.240
CHRIS: Perception zero.

02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:36.699
MATT and SAM: Yeah.

02:46:36.699 --> 02:46:41.788
CHRIS: Light! I see the light! I run toward it.

02:46:42.678 --> 02:46:44.713
LAURA: Can we see what it is?

02:46:45.355 --> 02:46:51.724
MATT: It looks to be the tunnel coming to an end
for some sort of chamber. You're too far away to

02:46:51.724 --> 02:46:57.719
make out any details, but it looks like there is a
room beyond it that has a dull, red glow to it.

02:46:57.720 --> 02:46:59.945
LAURA: Oh no, Spurt, don't run!

02:47:00.453 --> 02:47:02.345
MATT: You just run out?

02:47:02.345 --> 02:47:03.318
CHRIS: Yes.

02:47:03.318 --> 02:47:13.556
MATT: You guys see Spurt run out. The temperature
here is getting warmer and warmer as you progress.

02:47:13.556 --> 02:47:20.146
You're starting to find yourselves sweat
uncomfortably. You rush out into an open field of

02:47:20.146 --> 02:47:28.058
rock, like hewn, carved rock floor-- like a
courtyard, if you will. It's about a hundred feet

02:47:28.058 --> 02:47:36.131
or so across at first glance. Across the way,
there is a wall, or portions of a stone wall built

02:47:36.131 --> 02:47:43.005
into parts of an obsidian and stone cliff face or
the interior of a cavern. You look on the inside,

02:47:43.005 --> 02:47:48.588
and in this brief instant, you take in the
vicinity, through your kobold eyes, this large

02:47:48.588 --> 02:47:58.245
chamber that continues on far to your left. To the
right is, at a very steep incline, an obsidian

02:47:58.246 --> 02:48:06.431
wall, where a pouring river of molten magma is
coming down into a trough that goes across this

02:48:06.431 --> 02:48:13.463
open chamber-- this river of lava with a bridge
that goes across it to the opposite side. To the

02:48:13.463 --> 02:48:25.165
left, there is a very interesting, massive black
iron citadel that sits maybe a quarter mile to

02:48:25.166 --> 02:48:33.005
the left of you. At the peak of it-- and this is a
very large chamber-- dozens of thick, heavy black

02:48:33.005 --> 02:48:42.596
chains affixed to its peak drape off and connect
to the odd corners of this large cavern. This is

02:48:42.596 --> 02:48:48.477
far to your left; you're in a small side courtyard
on this side. As you stop and look around--

02:48:53.449 --> 02:49:03.844
(laughs) hilariously unnoticed by the two massive
fire giants that are currently playing sentinel.

02:49:03.844 --> 02:49:08.862
There's one across the way, leaning against the
wall, standing at roughly 18 to 20 feet tall, dark

02:49:08.862 --> 02:49:13.763
gray skin. What little bit of red hair you see
peeking from underneath its armored helmet as

02:49:13.763 --> 02:49:20.904
it's wearing heavy, dark armor covered in spikes,
metallic thorns. One hand is holding a tower

02:49:20.904 --> 02:49:26.678
shield, roughly its full height, also covered in
spikes in the front, with another shield just like

02:49:26.678 --> 02:49:31.997
that that's leaning on the wall. It looks like
it's currently spacing out for a moment, looking

02:49:31.998 --> 02:49:38.198
back towards the citadel. To the immediate left of
you, on this side of that molten river, you see a

02:49:38.198 --> 02:49:43.086
female fire giant, wielding a giant maul, who is
in the process of picking her teeth with some sort

02:49:43.087 --> 02:49:49.123
of pointed bone, and neither have noticed you,
strangely. They rolled really shitty.

02:49:50.290 --> 02:49:52.950
LIAM: You said citadel. We are seeing
a fortress down here?

02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:55.711
MATT: You guys aren't seeing this.
You just see the kobold rush out.

02:49:55.711 --> 02:49:57.533
LIAM: Okay.

02:49:57.855 --> 02:50:00.989
MATT: So what do you do, Spurt?

02:50:00.989 --> 02:50:04.235
CHRIS: How far away is the closest one to me?

02:50:04.235 --> 02:50:07.799
MATT: The closest one to you is about
20 feet to your left.

02:50:07.799 --> 02:50:10.416
CHRIS: I throw my wasp nest in a bag at it.

02:50:10.416 --> 02:50:11.301
MATT: Okay!

02:50:11.301 --> 02:50:12.787
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:50:15.926 --> 02:50:18.214
MATT: Roll for attack on it-- or is it a saving
throw on their part?

02:50:18.214 --> 02:50:25.145
CHRIS: I throw the bag into a five-foot square
within 20 feet of me and it bursts open

02:50:25.145 --> 02:50:28.987
into a swarm of wasps with 11 hit points.

02:50:28.987 --> 02:50:44.253
MATT: Spurt runs out, turns, and, "Ah!" (impact,
buzzing). The giant goes (grunts) and slaps--

02:50:44.253 --> 02:50:46.997
CHRIS: You dead! You dead!

02:50:48.292 --> 02:50:49.969
LAURA: I love him!

02:50:49.969 --> 02:50:51.565
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:50:52.355 --> 02:50:54.644
TRAVIS: Please have some real armor!

02:50:55.026 --> 02:50:56.755
MATT: 22 to hit against you.

02:50:56.756 --> 02:50:58.697
CHRIS: (laughs) Okay.

02:51:00.932 --> 02:51:02.374
MATT: You take...

02:51:03.854 --> 02:51:06.014
TRAVIS: Remember that number, kids.

02:51:07.315 --> 02:51:09.532
28 points of bludgeoning damage.

02:51:09.532 --> 02:51:10.889
CHRIS: I win! (splats)

02:51:12.592 --> 02:51:16.327
MATT: You watch as Spurt turns after throwing
this, and then a giant hammer (slamming,

02:51:16.327 --> 02:51:21.802
squishing) Gallaghers Spurt across the stone floor
of this open way.

02:51:24.872 --> 02:51:26.839
LAURA and SAM: No!

02:51:27.823 --> 02:51:32.334
TRAVIS: I run to the side of the cavern wall and
lean up against it and shrink down.

02:51:32.334 --> 02:51:35.145
CHRIS: A little green slime seeps out underneath
the hammer.

02:51:35.145 --> 02:51:40.567
MATT: The hammer lifts up and you see the stringy
mess that was once Spurt detaching from the hammer.

02:51:40.693 --> 02:51:43.519
SAM: My boy! He was my boy!

02:51:43.519 --> 02:51:45.492
TRAVIS: Shh! Shh!

02:51:48.155 --> 02:51:49.709
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check here.

02:51:49.709 --> 02:51:51.960
LIAM: Caleb starts walking slowly back through the
entire walking formation.

02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:53.705
MATT: Your work is done here.

02:51:53.705 --> 02:51:57.127
(cheering, laughter)

02:51:57.699 --> 02:51:59.254
TRAVIS: Holy fuck!

02:51:59.254 --> 02:52:01.694
SAM: He died as he lived, as a spurt.

02:52:02.744 --> 02:52:04.814
MATT: Thank you, Chris.

02:52:06.594 --> 02:52:07.875
LAURA: What are we rolling, stealth?

02:52:07.875 --> 02:52:09.296
MATT: Stealth check.

02:52:09.296 --> 02:52:11.286
MARISHA: We fulfilled our end of the bargain.
I feel okay.

02:52:11.286 --> 02:52:12.286
TALIESIN: That happened.

02:52:12.286 --> 02:52:14.475
LIAM: That spurt was quick, but potent.

02:52:15.035 --> 02:52:17.388
MATT: No, Pass Without a Trace was not cast.

02:52:18.356 --> 02:52:19.874
MARISHA: We're stealthing?

02:52:21.517 --> 02:52:23.041
Natural 20!

02:52:23.042 --> 02:52:24.649
TALIESIN: (singing) Natural 20!

02:52:24.649 --> 02:52:27.789
LIAM: Well, fuck y'all, because I rolled a two.

02:52:28.899 --> 02:52:30.603
SAM: 23.

02:52:30.603 --> 02:52:32.747
LIAM: That's a four for me.

02:52:32.747 --> 02:52:36.117
TRAVIS: 23, natural 20, 19, and Yasha rolled an
11.

02:52:36.117 --> 02:52:37.787
LAURA: I rolled an 11.

02:52:37.787 --> 02:52:39.493
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

02:52:39.493 --> 02:52:41.681
MATT: Oh, wow. Okay.

02:52:41.681 --> 02:52:44.155
LAURA: Should I be rolling stealth checks
for Nugget?

02:52:44.155 --> 02:52:45.329
SAM: Is that Dani?

02:52:45.368 --> 02:52:47.827
TALIESIN: I just heard Dani break
in the other room.

02:52:47.827 --> 02:52:50.849
LIAM: There's a delayed reaction
out in the lobby!

02:52:50.849 --> 02:52:52.844
TALIESIN: The delay is the best.

02:52:53.559 --> 02:52:58.328
TRAVIS: Is that the quickest we've ever
had a player character come in and die?

02:52:58.328 --> 02:53:00.655
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

02:53:01.735 --> 02:53:08.733
MATT: As you guys all pull to the sides, you hear
(heavy stomping). A hand reaches down and rubs it

02:53:08.733 --> 02:53:14.747
through the smear that was once the kobold and
rises up. A couple of pieces (plopping) into the

02:53:14.748 --> 02:53:22.743
stonework, then the light goes dark as the giant's
head bends down and one giant eye peeks

02:53:22.743 --> 02:53:25.304
through the tunnel in your direction.

02:53:25.304 --> 02:53:28.374
TALIESIN: Is it on its way down into the tunnel?
How big is this tunnel, again?

02:53:28.374 --> 02:53:33.975
MATT: The tunnel is ten feet wide. The giant is
going to have a hard time. It could probably get

02:53:33.975 --> 02:53:40.250
in there if it crawled. Right now, it's leaning
down and looking inside.

02:53:40.628 --> 02:53:41.890
TALIESIN: Lights are dimmed.

02:53:41.890 --> 02:53:43.934
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're pressed flush.

02:53:43.934 --> 02:53:49.276
MATT: It glances around inside, bends its
head inside-- and it's completely engulfing

02:53:49.276 --> 02:53:50.657
the entire exit.

02:53:54.300 --> 02:53:58.181
(grunts) Backs out of
the tunnel and then steps to the side.

02:53:58.181 --> 02:54:02.310
You guys just barely fucking made that.

02:54:02.310 --> 02:54:05.098
TRAVIS: Thank you, two natural 20s.

02:54:05.431 --> 02:54:07.768
MATT: You hear it shout something in Giant.
Any of you guys speak Giant?

02:54:08.738 --> 02:54:09.982
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:54:10.166 --> 02:54:11.827
MATT: You do, that's right!

02:54:11.827 --> 02:54:14.014
SAM: Because he's a what?!

02:54:14.014 --> 02:54:18.737
MATT: Because of his background, his race.

02:54:18.737 --> 02:54:20.814
LIAM: Because he's so awesome!

02:54:20.814 --> 02:54:24.029
MATT: It's not a secret! It's actually one
of the languages that you get as a--

02:54:24.029 --> 02:54:25.211
SAM: It's secrets.

02:54:25.211 --> 02:54:26.141
MATT: Sure enough.

02:54:26.689 --> 02:54:29.164
TALIESIN: I was once a giant, there we go.
Carry on.

02:54:29.164 --> 02:54:38.469
MATT: There you go. What you hear is: (speaking
Giant). You recognize it as, "Be careful. Looks

02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:44.890
like we got rodents." You guys hear, on the
opposite side, the one that was laying with the

02:54:44.890 --> 02:54:52.981
shield sits up for a second and takes the shield,
walks over to the river of lava, scoops up some of

02:54:52.981 --> 02:54:58.485
it and pours it across the top of the shield. It's
like a pachinko machine; the lava fills the front

02:54:58.485 --> 02:55:02.427
of it, on the inside there's a pocket, and where
once there was just dark iron shield, now is

02:55:02.427 --> 02:55:08.967
heating up and the shields have a fiery exterior
to them. After it fills both the shields, it holds

02:55:08.967 --> 02:55:14.491
both of them, gets back to its position,
and they're both looking around.

02:55:14.865 --> 02:55:17.281
LIAM: Does Caduceus see that, or everybody?

02:55:17.282 --> 02:55:21.191
MATT: You guys, who are off to the side,
can glance over and watch this happen.

02:55:21.191 --> 02:55:25.062
It's across the way. You have no idea what the other
giant's doing, but this one is across the way

02:55:25.062 --> 02:55:27.120
and is visible from your position.

02:55:27.900 --> 02:55:30.411
TALIESIN: They think there are
more kobolds coming.

02:55:30.411 --> 02:55:32.740
LAURA: How are we going to get out of here?

02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:35.309
MARISHA: And where are we?

02:55:35.926 --> 02:55:44.751
SAM: Do we see into the chamber, across on the
other side? It's not a chamber; it's huge, right?

02:55:44.751 --> 02:55:49.880
MATT: It looks, you would guess, probably a
hundred or more feet across to the other side,

02:55:49.881 --> 02:55:52.527
but there is a wall there.
Make a perception check.

02:55:53.444 --> 02:55:55.349
SAM: I'm terrible at this. Five.

02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:57.006
MATT: It's hard to see from this distance.

02:55:57.007 --> 02:56:00.270
TRAVIS: Caleb, you ever read about
anything like this?

02:56:00.270 --> 02:56:06.941
LIAM: Have I ever read-- I've read a lot--
about fire giants under the earth? Yes.

02:56:06.941 --> 02:56:09.565
TRAVIS: Yeah, crazy, dark-- oh, you have?

02:56:09.565 --> 02:56:12.767
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, my grandmother used to keep me up
late at night, reading me stories about

02:56:12.767 --> 02:56:15.389
things like this. No, I don't know anything!
I don't know!

02:56:15.390 --> 02:56:19.099
TRAVIS: No dark citadels? I mean,
this is an accident, right?

02:56:19.099 --> 02:56:21.452
This isn't where we're trying to go.

02:56:21.453 --> 02:56:25.467
LIAM: I know about the history of the country I
grew up in, not about underground fortresses.

02:56:25.467 --> 02:56:29.840
LAURA: Ooh, you know what we should do?
We should mark this on the map.

02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:32.325
LIAM: Let's put a pin in that and get back to it.

02:56:32.325 --> 02:56:34.047
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll get back to that.

02:56:34.047 --> 02:56:37.414
TALIESIN: In a map? Should we mark this
on the map then, with a pin?

02:56:37.414 --> 02:56:39.215
LIAM: I was speaking in metaphor.

02:56:39.215 --> 02:56:41.411
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I like those.

02:56:41.411 --> 02:56:46.565
SAM: What do we do? We can sneak in.
We can create a diversion.

02:56:46.565 --> 02:56:53.574
LAURA: We could create a diversion. Hold on,
let me see what kind of spells I have taken.

02:56:53.574 --> 02:56:56.162
SAM: But then to what end? We're going to
run in there and do what?

02:56:56.162 --> 02:56:59.990
TRAVIS: How far from the opening of
the tunnel that we're at, off to the left,

02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:02.438
are both of the fire giants?

02:57:04.118 --> 02:57:08.190
MATT: Make a perception check for me
to take in the details of the scenery.

02:57:10.692 --> 02:57:11.887
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:57:11.887 --> 02:57:19.524
MATT: No shit. Okay, not only, as you lean forward
and poke through, really assess the scene--

02:57:19.524 --> 02:57:24.713
I'll just pull out the map and show you, because
you rolled a natural 20. I'll be right back.

02:57:24.713 --> 02:57:27.392
TRAVIS: Got to love those Critical Role dice.

02:57:27.392 --> 02:57:29.947
MARISHA: So attractive, so sexy.

02:57:29.947 --> 02:57:35.399
LIAM: Perkins! You are such a fun player! Jeez!

02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:42.015
TRAVIS: You chaotic motherfucker. How much
shit can I throw on one person?

02:57:42.015 --> 02:57:47.126
LIAM: Such a 180 from Shale, when you were
here the last time.

02:57:49.776 --> 02:57:56.512
MATT: Here's where you guys are. This is the
tunnel. Because you rolled a natural 20, you can

02:57:56.597 --> 02:58:04.190
see on the other side a continuation. You gather
that when the Kryn traveled through, they probably

02:58:04.191 --> 02:58:10.097
had to make their way through this chamber, and
you gather from the surrounding and the vicinity,

02:58:10.097 --> 02:58:16.505
the obsidian was probably a difficult thing to
pass through for this worm, and probably

02:58:16.506 --> 02:58:20.729
why it was forced to briefly make its way
through this courtyard.

02:58:20.729 --> 02:58:22.969
TRAVIS: What is this? Where the fuck are we?

02:58:22.969 --> 02:58:28.581
SAM: Do we think that the Kryn went through
and were allowed to pass?

02:58:28.581 --> 02:58:33.491
LAURA: I bet that these people are posted here&lt;i&gt;
because&lt;/i&gt; the Kryn came through.

02:58:33.491 --> 02:58:36.726
MATT: That's an interesting observation.

02:58:36.726 --> 02:58:44.630
TRAVIS: I think diplomacy will be
our best tactic. Let's use words.

02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:47.028
SAM: Let's offer them some food.

02:58:47.028 --> 02:58:52.713
TRAVIS: Yeah, it worked well before.
And the other fire giant--

02:58:52.713 --> 02:58:54.495
SAM: Is that the splatter of dead Spurt?

02:58:54.496 --> 02:58:57.260
MATT: Yeah, that's where Spurt met his end.

02:58:57.260 --> 02:58:58.434
SAM: Here lies Spurt.

02:58:58.435 --> 02:59:01.705
TRAVIS: The second fire giant is on this
side of the molten river of death?

02:59:01.705 --> 02:59:02.941
MATT: Right there.

02:59:02.941 --> 02:59:04.062
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, one.

02:59:04.062 --> 02:59:05.755
MATT: Then that's the other one
on the opposite side.

02:59:05.756 --> 02:59:08.736
TRAVIS: That's a fire giant? I thought
that was the citadel.

02:59:08.736 --> 02:59:11.081
MATT: No, the citadel's way that way.

02:59:11.081 --> 02:59:12.737
TRAVIS: Those are shields?!

02:59:12.738 --> 02:59:13.371
MATT: Yeah.

02:59:13.371 --> 02:59:16.266
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can't see the actual figure.

02:59:16.266 --> 02:59:21.907
LIAM: Yeah. That's a dude, double fisting, full on--

02:59:21.907 --> 02:59:23.943
TRAVIS: This the worst American Gladiators
course ever.

02:59:23.943 --> 02:59:28.091
(laughter)

02:59:28.091 --> 02:59:31.747
TRAVIS: He's right next to where we need to go.
It's a big problem.

02:59:31.748 --> 02:59:33.589
SAM: Pugil sticks.

02:59:33.589 --> 02:59:38.564
MATT: There's Laser and Target! And you're going
to fight: fucked!

02:59:38.564 --> 02:59:41.039
TRAVIS: Fire shield! Magma shield!

02:59:41.039 --> 02:59:50.255
LAURA: So potentially-- Okay, I have an idea. What
if, Caleb, you make your bubble then one of us

02:59:50.255 --> 02:59:55.759
just yells out to the fire giants, "Hey. We just
want to pass through; we don't want to have

02:59:55.759 --> 02:59:59.039
"anything to do with you. We're just chasing down
these dicks that passed through your land,

02:59:59.039 --> 03:00:04.448
"that's it." Then we hide in your bubble
so that they can't attack us.

03:00:04.448 --> 03:00:06.020
SAM: Then they know we are here.

03:00:06.020 --> 03:00:10.719
LAURA: Well, yeah, but what are we going to do?
We can't all be invisible and they're right here.

03:00:10.719 --> 03:00:13.189
TRAVIS: What happens after they attack us
in the bubble?

03:00:13.189 --> 03:00:16.071
TALIESIN: How much can the bubble take?

03:00:16.071 --> 03:00:18.562
LAURA: They can't get us through the bubble.

03:00:18.562 --> 03:00:22.304
LIAM: Maybe they will go to sleep eventually.
Maybe we can come back a little later.

03:00:22.304 --> 03:00:25.797
LAURA: You don't think they're going to have other
sentries posted when they leave their post?

03:00:26.172 --> 03:00:28.743
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know about
the bubble thing.

03:00:28.743 --> 03:00:32.165
TALIESIN: I can throw my voice if we have to.

03:00:32.165 --> 03:00:34.861
TRAVIS: What if it breaks, what about
when it expires?

03:00:34.861 --> 03:00:39.357
LAURA: I'm just saying in the tunnel.
It's just an extra bonus of being in the

03:00:39.357 --> 03:00:41.345
tunnel and extra protection or something.

03:00:41.346 --> 03:00:43.320
SAM: We could have it there
in case we need to retreat.

03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:46.815
LIAM: Yeah, if we are crazy enough to start
a fight with these two--

03:00:46.815 --> 03:00:49.260
LAURA: Which I don't want to do. I just
want to talk to them.

03:00:49.260 --> 03:00:52.145
LIAM: But if we do, the bubble is a good idea,
although I have to stay in the bubble

03:00:52.145 --> 03:00:55.408
for the bubble to be in effect.

03:00:55.408 --> 03:01:01.524
TRAVIS: Non-fighting options: I can take one
person with me, 90 feet, in a single direction.

03:01:01.524 --> 03:01:05.195
TALIESIN: I can also make my voice, I believe,
come from wherever I like within 30 feet.

03:01:05.195 --> 03:01:08.572
MARISHA: I mean, use a distraction,
get them looking at something else.

03:01:08.572 --> 03:01:11.517
TALIESIN: Just to have a conversation with these
guys, see if they're willing to make a deal.

03:01:11.517 --> 03:01:13.672
SAM: Jester can get across the entire span.

03:01:13.672 --> 03:01:15.361
LAURA: Yes, I could do it.

03:01:15.361 --> 03:01:18.130
SAM: I could turn invisible.
I could create a diversion.

03:01:18.130 --> 03:01:23.702
MARISHA: I am a great sprinter, like,
real good, 100 meter dash.

03:01:23.702 --> 03:01:24.524
SAM: Sure.

03:01:24.524 --> 03:01:26.380
MARISHA: Right, just saying.

03:01:26.380 --> 03:01:27.884
TALIESIN: I can get across.

03:01:27.884 --> 03:01:33.399
TRAVIS: I could create a false diversion that's a
massive beast in the opposite direction of us

03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:35.242
or I could make a real beast.

03:01:35.242 --> 03:01:40.151
LAURA: Yeah, can you make it look like
it comes from the cave and then runs off

03:01:40.151 --> 03:01:43.137
so that it doesn't appear out of nowhere?

03:01:43.137 --> 03:01:45.171
MARISHA: Which cave? Our cave?

03:01:45.171 --> 03:01:48.139
LAURA: Or the other cave maybe, no.
I don't know.

03:01:48.139 --> 03:01:49.863
SAM: Or just emerge from the lava.

03:01:49.863 --> 03:01:51.934
LAURA: Or just come out of the lava.

03:01:51.934 --> 03:01:54.767
MARISHA: Ooh. Lava monster.

03:01:54.767 --> 03:02:01.298
LIAM: What about this? What if Fjord does
that distraction we talked about across the fire.

03:02:01.299 --> 03:02:09.629
You Banished that stone creature? I know
how to do that as well. If you and I both

03:02:09.629 --> 03:02:14.419
take a shot at the one on our side,
one of us maybe will succeed.

03:02:14.419 --> 03:02:19.316
TALIESIN: If I hit it with Bane beforehand it
would also have a slightly harder time doing that.

03:02:19.316 --> 03:02:27.212
LAURA: Oof. But it could also succeed against us
and then we'll have to fight a giant. I think it

03:02:27.212 --> 03:02:32.945
would be better if, you know, I could Dimension
Door with you, Caleb, over to the other side.

03:02:32.945 --> 03:02:33.904
LIAM: And?

03:02:33.905 --> 03:02:37.757
LAURA: And then we just keep going.
We never engage with these fucks.

03:02:37.757 --> 03:02:40.324
SAM: Wait, what about us? What about the
rest of us? You're just going to leave us?

03:02:40.324 --> 03:02:43.226
LAURA: Well, he's going to make a
big distraction and then we all run.

03:02:43.226 --> 03:02:55.683
TALIESIN: I have a sneaking suspicion that
there's probably-- These giants are fast,

03:02:55.683 --> 03:03:01.774
faster than we are. Probably with some range.

03:03:01.774 --> 03:03:06.858
MARISHA: Would I know anything about giants,
reading up on them or anything?

03:03:06.858 --> 03:03:13.062
MATT: Go ahead and roll a history check for me.

03:03:13.062 --> 03:03:18.142
MARISHA: Cobalt. 19.

03:03:18.142 --> 03:03:26.954
MATT: They generally live beneath mountain ranges
and areas of heavy volcanic activity. They are

03:03:26.954 --> 03:03:44.814
considered the artisan crafters and forgers of
giant kin and the Ordning. They have-- They're evil.

03:03:45.350 --> 03:03:47.526
TRAVIS: Oh, they both are?

03:03:47.526 --> 03:03:49.768
MATT: No, that's just giants.

03:03:49.768 --> 03:03:57.916
MARISHA: So probably not amicable
or prone to negotiation?

03:03:57.917 --> 03:04:07.233
MATT: They can be. If it suits them well.
They enjoy free labor, so they like to

03:04:07.233 --> 03:04:10.621
take slaves to force to do the menial tasks.

03:04:10.621 --> 03:04:14.782
MARISHA: And they craft things so
they're not stupid?

03:04:14.782 --> 03:04:21.616
MATT: No. They're intelligent like
an average being would be.

03:04:21.616 --> 03:04:23.716
MARISHA: Averagely smart.

03:04:23.716 --> 03:04:28.899
MATT: From what you've heard. You don't
have a whole lot of knowledge necessarily.

03:04:28.900 --> 03:04:34.392
You haven't heard of tales of the great
crafty intelligence, but nevertheless,

03:04:34.392 --> 03:04:37.984
they still built this entire underground city.

03:04:37.984 --> 03:04:41.619
MARISHA: Yeah, I read this tome once in
the library, but I was a little distracted

03:04:41.981 --> 03:04:46.168
when reading it because the monks had also
drawn a bunch of dick and dudes putting

03:04:46.168 --> 03:04:50.177
horns up their butts in the margins.
It just happens, yeah.

03:04:50.177 --> 03:04:52.828
LAURA: Shut up. Wait, which library was this?

03:04:52.828 --> 03:04:54.196
MARISHA: In the Cobalt Soul.

03:04:54.196 --> 03:04:55.425
SAM: Focus.

03:04:55.426 --> 03:05:01.373
TRAVIS: I have a suggestion. I can make a
manticore appear, run from the cave and leap/fly

03:05:01.373 --> 03:05:06.049
over the river and carry off in the direction
that is opposite of where we need to go.

03:05:06.049 --> 03:05:08.124
LAURA: Yeah. Then we all run.

03:05:08.124 --> 03:05:11.101
SAM: Is this a real manticore or is it
an image of one?

03:05:11.101 --> 03:05:17.434
TRAVIS: It sounds and looks like a real manticore,
but if you make contact with it, it's just an illusion.

03:05:17.434 --> 03:05:24.555
LIAM: While they are all debating this, I channel
a little bit of transmutive energy into my

03:05:24.555 --> 03:05:30.870
stone and change its focus from constitution
to fire resistance for myself.

03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:36.476
TRAVIS: So you can go invisible, you can go
the entire distance, you're fast as balls.

03:05:36.730 --> 03:05:38.351
LAURA: Go the distance!

03:05:38.351 --> 03:05:40.145
TRAVIS: Caleb's fast as balls.

03:05:40.145 --> 03:05:43.015
TALIESIN: I can briefly go invisible,
but not for this whole run.

03:05:43.016 --> 03:05:44.458
LIAM: Not today, I didn't study that last night.

03:05:44.458 --> 03:05:45.926
TRAVIS: I can take one person with me.

03:05:45.926 --> 03:05:48.217
LAURA: Can you get that far, too?

03:05:48.217 --> 03:05:50.142
TRAVIS: With one person.

03:05:50.142 --> 03:05:53.427
TALIESIN: Mister Caleb is the one to go.

03:05:53.427 --> 03:05:54.906
SAM: What about Yasha?

03:05:54.906 --> 03:05:57.578
LAURA: Somebody take Caleb. I'll take Yasha.

03:05:57.578 --> 03:05:59.155
SAM: You can't take Yasha.

03:05:59.155 --> 03:06:01.954
LAURA: Why?

03:06:01.954 --> 03:06:04.508
SAM: She's bigger than you.

03:06:04.508 --> 03:06:06.931
MATT: They're both medium sized.

03:06:06.931 --> 03:06:07.799
LAURA: Yeah. She's not large.

03:06:07.799 --> 03:06:12.539
TRAVIS: Who's the odd man out? Who doesn't
have a way to get over there real quick?

03:06:12.920 --> 03:06:14.668
SAM: I can run and I'm invisible.

03:06:14.668 --> 03:06:17.757
MARISHA: How fast can you run?
You're pretty fast.

03:06:17.757 --> 03:06:20.135
LIAM: Yeah, it's you two.
You are the quickest.

03:06:20.135 --> 03:06:25.412
TALIESIN: I can be invisible for one run--
for one action.

03:06:25.412 --> 03:06:28.791
TRAVIS: How long is your speed?

03:06:28.792 --> 03:06:30.970
TALIESIN: I can get 60 feet.

03:06:30.970 --> 03:06:36.145
LAURA: I could Blessing Of The Trickster
you here and that way you're a little

03:06:36.145 --> 03:06:38.218
more stealthy as you're going.

03:06:38.218 --> 03:06:41.178
TALIESIN: Oh, I mean, I'll be invisible
until I'm visible.

03:06:41.178 --> 03:06:44.306
TRAVIS: Nott, how do you feel about---

03:06:44.306 --> 03:06:47.758
LAURA: I could Polymorph someone!

03:06:47.758 --> 03:06:48.928
SAM: Into what?

03:06:48.928 --> 03:06:50.450
LAURA: Into something that, you know—

03:06:50.451 --> 03:06:51.428
SAM: Dragonfly.

03:06:51.428 --> 03:06:55.144
LAURA: Yeah! That can get across! I could
Polymorph. I could Polymorph you

03:06:55.144 --> 03:06:58.085
and I could Dimension Door me and Yasha.

03:06:58.086 --> 03:06:59.739
TRAVIS: Sure, okay.

03:06:59.739 --> 03:07:05.083
MATT: You hear this heavy smacking sound as
the fire giant on your side of this courtyard

03:07:05.083 --> 03:07:10.011
is putting to bed the rest of the bees that
have been harrying its kneecap.

03:07:10.011 --> 03:07:13.469
TRAVIS: Caleb, do you have a plan?

03:07:13.469 --> 03:07:14.691
LIAM: A plan?

03:07:14.691 --> 03:07:16.508
TRAVIS: To get across?

03:07:16.508 --> 03:07:18.451
LIAM: I'm the odd man out.

03:07:18.452 --> 03:07:19.558
TRAVIS: I'm asking.

03:07:19.558 --> 03:07:23.289
LIAM: No, there are many things I could do,
but I did not do my homework last night

03:07:23.289 --> 03:07:25.420
that would facilitate those things.

03:07:25.420 --> 03:07:27.482
SAM: Are you going to bamf with him?
Weren't you going to Dimension Door?

03:07:27.482 --> 03:07:29.518
LAURA: One of us needs to take Yasha,
one of us needs to take Caleb.

03:07:29.518 --> 03:07:31.271
TRAVIS: I'm taking Caleb.

03:07:31.271 --> 03:07:32.487
LAURA: I'll take Yasha.

03:07:32.487 --> 03:07:33.950
TRAVIS: You're running balls, you're invisible.

03:07:33.950 --> 03:07:34.847
SAM: How far can you go?

03:07:34.847 --> 03:07:35.610
TRAVIS: 90 feet.

03:07:35.610 --> 03:07:40.645
SAM: That is not across the way. That is just to
the other side of the bridge, maybe.

03:07:40.645 --> 03:07:43.432
LAURA: I thought you could go farther than that,
Fjord, that's not as far.

03:07:43.432 --> 03:07:46.632
TRAVIS: It would be pretty close. We're going to
send both of them in the opposite direction.

03:07:46.632 --> 03:07:48.799
MARISHA: Are we dashing partners, me and you?

03:07:48.799 --> 03:07:49.550
SAM: Yeah.

03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:50.450
MARISHA: All right.

03:07:50.450 --> 03:07:53.390
TRAVIS: Yeah. We don't do any of this until they
fucking move away from where we need to go.

03:07:53.390 --> 03:07:54.136
Ready?

03:07:54.136 --> 03:07:54.996
MARISHA: I like it.

03:07:54.996 --> 03:08:00.119
LAURA: Wait. How about &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; take Caleb the entire
distance, you and Yasha bamf 90 feet and run

03:08:00.119 --> 03:08:02.936
because Caleb is squishy.

03:08:02.936 --> 03:08:04.832
TRAVIS: Sure, sounds good, I like it.

03:08:04.832 --> 03:08:07.392
TALIESIN: Should I be invisible at the beginning
or at the end?

03:08:07.392 --> 03:08:08.988
LAURA: Do you want to be Polymorphed?

03:08:08.989 --> 03:08:11.400
TALIESIN: I can be invisible for 60 feet.

03:08:11.400 --> 03:08:13.914
LAURA: Okay, well I won't be able to
Polymorph you once you're out.

03:08:13.914 --> 03:08:16.535
TALIESIN: I'll Polymorph, then, I guess.

03:08:16.535 --> 03:08:19.647
LAURA: Do you keep your intelligence
when you're polymorphed?

03:08:19.648 --> 03:08:22.752
TRAVIS: Here's the order. You're going to
Polymorph Caduceus. You're going to go invisible

03:08:22.752 --> 03:08:26.106
and get started. I'm going to set the diversion
and then we start going.

03:08:26.106 --> 03:08:28.186
MARISHA: And then we're going to go. Okay.

03:08:28.186 --> 03:08:31.893
SAM: Do you need me to do anything to make the
diversion look even more realistic?

03:08:31.893 --> 03:08:33.315
TRAVIS: I don't think so.

03:08:33.315 --> 03:08:34.864
SAM: Because I could--

03:08:34.864 --> 03:08:41.537
LIAM: Jester, bring the haversack over, open it up
so that Beauregard can focus on the mote of possibility.

03:08:41.537 --> 03:08:42.388
LAURA: Here, Beau.

03:08:42.388 --> 03:08:44.034
MARISHA: Is that bad? Is that going to
send stuff to-- okay.

03:08:44.034 --> 03:08:45.546
LAURA: Don't take it out just let it in.

03:08:45.546 --> 03:08:47.974
LIAM: Just look into the bag.
Just like huffing gasoline.

03:08:47.974 --> 03:08:50.772
MARISHA: (deep inhale)

03:08:50.772 --> 03:08:52.889
SAM: Oh, you're huffing literally right now?

03:08:52.889 --> 03:08:57.549
MATT: Okay, you take a moment
and focus on the dodecahedron.

03:08:57.549 --> 03:08:59.260
TRAVIS: You are doing that?

03:08:59.260 --> 03:09:01.193
LAURA and LIAM: It's in the bag.

03:09:01.193 --> 03:09:04.843
MATT: You take your fragment of possibility.

03:09:04.843 --> 03:09:07.270
LIAM: Beauregard's face goes into
another dimension for a moment.

03:09:07.270 --> 03:09:09.689
SAM: You got silver paint all over.

03:09:09.689 --> 03:09:15.198
(laughter)

03:09:15.198 --> 03:09:16.108
MARISHA: Okay.

03:09:16.108 --> 03:09:23.992
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to Blessing Of The
Trickster you. You're still super stealthy,

03:09:23.992 --> 03:09:25.237
I don't know if it matters.

03:09:25.237 --> 03:09:26.086
SAM: Jester.

03:09:26.086 --> 03:09:26.956
LAURA: What?

03:09:26.956 --> 03:09:29.985
SAM: It was so wonderful having Nugget around.

03:09:29.985 --> 03:09:33.426
LAURA: Nugget's just going to run out and he's
going to blink and blink and blink as far as he can.

03:09:33.426 --> 03:09:35.080
SAM: He's going to be fine.

03:09:35.080 --> 03:09:37.084
LAURA: Yeah. He's going to be fine.

03:09:37.085 --> 03:09:40.637
TALIESIN: I'm also going to add resistance to
you so you can add a d4 to any saving throw

03:09:40.637 --> 03:09:43.061
for the next 60 seconds.

03:09:43.061 --> 03:09:46.369
LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth checks.

03:09:46.370 --> 03:09:49.305
TALIESIN: You can add a d4 to any saving throw.

03:09:52.435 --> 03:09:54.213
MATT: All right.

03:09:54.213 --> 03:09:58.880
TRAVIS: I turn to Yasha and say: When I give
you the signal, you and I are going to run

03:09:59.145 --> 03:10:03.388
towards the river of magma and hold on tight.

03:10:03.388 --> 03:10:04.794
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:10:04.794 --> 03:10:06.949
MATT: You guys are over on this side here.

03:10:06.949 --> 03:10:10.542
SAM: This is going to go so good.

03:10:10.542 --> 03:10:14.019
TALIESIN: This is going to go great.
It's a great plan.

03:10:14.019 --> 03:10:17.561
SAM: Mighty Nein, we have to do this
for the memory of Spurt.

03:10:17.561 --> 03:10:19.354
TALIESIN: Who?

03:10:19.355 --> 03:10:20.643
SAM: For Spurt!

03:10:20.643 --> 03:10:21.831
LAURA: He was so cute.

03:10:21.831 --> 03:10:25.928
SAM: The kobold who was just introduced to us
and killed.

03:10:25.928 --> 03:10:29.752
LAURA: Okay, what should I make you?
What do you want to be?

03:10:29.752 --> 03:10:34.126
TALIESIN: I don't know. Man, there are so many
options. What would be fun? I don't know.

03:10:34.126 --> 03:10:35.505
LAURA: Maybe a dragonfly could be really cool.

03:10:35.505 --> 03:10:37.616
TALIESIN: I mean, dragonflies are pretty cool.

03:10:37.616 --> 03:10:38.602
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:10:38.602 --> 03:10:44.445
LAURA: Okay. Well, if you're a dragonfly, will
you remember what you're supposed to do?

03:10:44.445 --> 03:10:47.112
TALIESIN: Well, I don't know, but to be fair,
I'm not sure if I remember

03:10:47.113 --> 03:10:49.287
what I'm supposed to do anyway.

03:10:49.287 --> 03:10:52.290
MATT: While you guys are working out the
specifics, I'm going to grab something real fast.

03:10:52.290 --> 03:10:53.929
Keep talking amongst yourselves.

03:10:53.929 --> 03:10:58.717
LAURA: If you cast Polymorph-- If I were to cast
it on myself, I would remember what I was doing.

03:10:58.717 --> 03:11:03.584
LIAM: Yes, you keep all your thoughts.
Look, there's the creative lead

03:11:03.584 --> 03:11:05.760
of Dungeons &amp; Dragons over there.

03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:08.583
TALIESIN: Who would be like: "Um, actually--"

03:11:08.583 --> 03:11:12.434
LIAM: You take all the stat adjustments except for
your brains in there, so all your decision making

03:11:12.434 --> 03:11:17.426
is the same. But dexterity saves and stuff,
that's the creature's stats, right?

03:11:17.426 --> 03:11:20.658
TRAVIS: But Nugget's like, in your pocket, right?

03:11:20.658 --> 03:11:23.631
LAURA: No, Sprinkle's in my pocket.

03:11:23.631 --> 03:11:27.646
SAM: Doesn't everyone have the creative lead
of D&amp;D next to them when they play a game?

03:11:27.646 --> 03:11:31.602
TALIESIN: You get the limited edition
from the local store, you know.

03:11:31.602 --> 03:11:33.622
LAURA: I actually have a question, Matt.

03:11:33.622 --> 03:11:34.280
MATT: Yes?

03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:37.778
LAURA: When I Dimension Door, I can take
another creature.

03:11:37.778 --> 03:11:38.603
MATT: Yes.

03:11:38.603 --> 03:11:43.059
LAURA: Does that mean I can't have Sprinkle on me
or else I won't be able to take Caleb.

03:11:43.059 --> 03:11:44.077
MATT: Correct.

03:11:44.686 --> 03:11:50.490
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to take Sprinkle off, out
of my hood. Okay, Beau? Take care of Sprinkle.

03:11:50.490 --> 03:11:52.270
TALIESIN: It's on you.

03:11:52.270 --> 03:11:59.243
LAURA: No, it's okay, Sprinkle. Just hold onto him
when you run, okay? Don't let him get left behind.

03:11:59.243 --> 03:12:02.321
MARISHA: Can't he do-- He's more
magical than I am.

03:12:02.321 --> 03:12:04.584
LAURA: It's Sprinkle, he's my weasel.

03:12:04.585 --> 03:12:05.220
MARISHA: Oh.

03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:16.477
LIAM: Just imagine if Jester had teleported away
and went with Sprinkle and Caleb is just going: Uh?

03:12:16.477 --> 03:12:17.872
MATT: I love it.

03:12:17.872 --> 03:12:22.829
LAURA: Nugget's going to blink, blink, blink.

03:12:22.829 --> 03:12:31.976
TALIESIN: I'm going to hide, probably in your
pocket. I'm going to hide on you as the dragonfly.

03:12:31.976 --> 03:12:34.478
MARISHA: Okay. I'm a one-woman petting zoo.
Let's go.

03:12:34.478 --> 03:12:37.022
TRAVIS: Three, two, one.

03:12:37.022 --> 03:12:38.476
LAURA: Polymorph.

03:12:38.476 --> 03:12:40.016
SAM: Invisible!

03:12:40.016 --> 03:12:42.210
MATT: So what order are we doing this, guys?

03:12:42.210 --> 03:12:43.454
LAURA: Polymorph.

03:12:43.454 --> 03:12:45.054
SAM: Invisible!

03:12:45.054 --> 03:12:47.445
MATT: So you're Polymorphing Caduceus into what?

03:12:47.445 --> 03:12:49.182
LAURA and TALIESIN: A dragonfly.

03:12:49.183 --> 03:12:51.793
TRAVIS: Get your head start, both of you.

03:12:51.793 --> 03:12:55.834
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of that,
we'll say this is you.

03:12:55.834 --> 03:12:58.475
MARISHA: You're hitching a ride on me.

03:12:58.475 --> 03:13:01.068
TALIESIN: I'm going to hitch a ride on you.

03:13:01.069 --> 03:13:05.880
MATT: All right. The dragonfly jumps onto Beau.
Beau is now in the position to hold—

03:13:05.880 --> 03:13:08.565
TRAVIS: You're not just going to fly across
the room by yourself?

03:13:08.565 --> 03:13:09.670
TALIESIN: She's faster.

03:13:09.670 --> 03:13:11.772
LIAM: Beauregard is now Noah's ark.

03:13:11.772 --> 03:13:14.830
TALIESIN: You are the Mighty Menagerie.

03:13:14.830 --> 03:13:19.750
TRAVIS: Beau and Nott, I'm going to give you
15 seconds before we start.

03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:24.028
SAM: I think we should start with the monster.

03:13:24.028 --> 03:13:25.821
TRAVIS: It's your call.

03:13:25.821 --> 03:13:28.754
SAM: Because if I go out there and trip,
the jig is up.

03:13:28.754 --> 03:13:31.080
TRAVIS: Are you going to trip?

03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:33.117
LAURA: Plus, it's expecting something
to come out the door.

03:13:33.117 --> 03:13:42.291
TRAVIS: All right, fine. I will use Major Image
and I will cast the image of a manticore

03:13:42.292 --> 03:13:49.391
climbing out of the magma river on this side
of the bank, roaring at the fire giant

03:13:49.391 --> 03:13:52.624
and then leap, flying over to the other side.

03:13:52.624 --> 03:13:54.120
MATT: Okay.

03:13:54.121 --> 03:13:55.908
TALIESIN: That's epic.

03:13:55.908 --> 03:13:59.948
SAM: Jar of peanut butter? Get ready for a dick.

03:13:59.948 --> 03:14:08.068
(laughter)

03:14:08.069 --> 03:14:18.630
MATT: Out of the molten rock. Wings. (growling)
The manticore begins to rise. Both of the giants

03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:24.389
look confused towards it and then each other. The
one with the shields braces the shields in front.

03:14:24.897 --> 03:14:29.010
The other one, looking off to the side, goes and
reaches off to one of the boulders off to the side

03:14:29.010 --> 03:14:33.130
and grabs it. As it picks it up, those at the
front can see, the rock seems to heat up. There

03:14:33.131 --> 03:14:41.460
are veins of heat on the inside as it grips it. So
you create the effect. This is Major Image, right?

03:14:41.460 --> 03:14:44.887
SAM: Major Image. Visuals and sounds.

03:14:44.887 --> 03:14:46.400
TRAVIS: Visuals and sounds.

03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:50.392
MATT: Yes. All right. They're both going to look
forward towards it to see what the hell it is.

03:14:50.392 --> 03:14:54.047
Watching a manticore rise out of magma is insane.

03:14:54.047 --> 03:14:55.444
LIAM: Very heavy metal.

03:14:55.444 --> 03:14:56.560
MATT: Correct.

03:14:56.560 --> 03:14:58.866
TRAVIS: Yeah, he comes out here, roars,
and then jumps over.

03:14:58.866 --> 03:15:06.049
MATT: Correct. The guy with the shields, he's
attempting to ascertain, with his investigation,

03:15:06.050 --> 03:15:11.961
as to what the fuck is going on. He rolled
a natural 19 minus one. That's an 18.

03:15:11.961 --> 03:15:13.930
What's your spell DC?

03:15:13.930 --> 03:15:20.020
TRAVIS: I think it's a 16. Shit. Where the hell is
that on this thing?

03:15:20.020 --> 03:15:22.755
SAM: Perfect plan. Foiled on the first step.

03:15:22.755 --> 03:15:25.889
TRAVIS: Anyone know where that is?

03:15:25.889 --> 03:15:27.255
MARISHA: Your spell save DC?

03:15:27.255 --> 03:15:30.207
LAURA: It's right at the top of your--
If you hit Spells, it'll say at the top.

03:15:30.207 --> 03:15:31.302
TRAVIS: Oh. 16.

03:15:31.302 --> 03:15:36.612
MATT: Yeah. The one with the shields goes like--
just looks confused as it takes off.

03:15:36.612 --> 03:15:39.468
The other one...

03:15:39.468 --> 03:15:43.027
LIAM: One? 20?

03:15:43.027 --> 03:15:45.754
LAURA: What is it? Is it a natural 20?

03:15:45.754 --> 03:15:47.681
MATT: No, I literally rolled two 19s in a row.

03:15:47.681 --> 03:15:48.528
LAURA and LIAM: Aw.

03:15:48.528 --> 03:15:50.070
MATT: I'm sorry!

03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:51.479
TRAVIS: I'm not.

03:15:51.480 --> 03:15:57.040
MATT: As the manticore takes off, the one holding
the rock is like-- It twists the rock in the other

03:15:57.040 --> 03:16:05.813
hand and reaches over to the side and grabs a
chain and starts ringing this loud bell. It's

03:16:05.813 --> 03:16:11.695
echoing through the chamber. They're both
confused as this thing flies off and

03:16:11.695 --> 03:16:13.372
they look at each other like--

03:16:13.373 --> 03:16:14.955
LAURA: Are they looking at each other?

03:16:14.955 --> 03:16:17.539
MATT: Yeah, they're looking at each other.
What's up next?

03:16:17.539 --> 03:16:19.020
LAURA: Should we--

03:16:19.020 --> 03:16:22.451
MARISHA: Run? Plan still goes?

03:16:22.451 --> 03:16:25.286
MATT: I can't believe I rolled-- It was such
a great idea, I just rolled really high!

03:16:25.286 --> 03:16:27.942
LAURA: Do we have any other thingies?

03:16:27.942 --> 03:16:32.148
SAM: Is Invisibility? It's concentration.
I can't do anything else.

03:16:32.148 --> 03:16:37.622
MARISHA: I still have bottle rockets.
That's all I got.

03:16:37.622 --> 03:16:39.402
MATT: Who's doing what?

03:16:39.402 --> 03:16:41.522
LAURA: Hold on!

03:16:41.523 --> 03:16:43.992
LIAM: They're clanging?

03:16:43.992 --> 03:16:49.231
TRAVIS: If we run out of here are we--
How far is his melee, ten feet?

03:16:49.231 --> 03:16:50.706
MATT: You don't know.

03:16:50.706 --> 03:16:52.396
SAM: I would say 20.

03:16:52.396 --> 03:16:53.784
TRAVIS: Massive.

03:16:53.784 --> 03:16:56.002
LIAM: It's probably ten or 15.

03:16:56.002 --> 03:17:02.348
MATT: You would imagine it has larger reach
than an average creature, being a giant.

03:17:02.348 --> 03:17:10.984
LAURA: Well, should we just wait
until it dies down then go?

03:17:10.984 --> 03:17:19.445
LIAM: Hey, I'll do it. Caleb leans out the
passageway and casts Polymorph on the giant.

03:17:19.445 --> 03:17:22.616
MATT: On the giant? Okay.
What's the save on that?

03:17:22.616 --> 03:17:28.272
LIAM: It is 16, I believe.

03:17:28.272 --> 03:17:29.711
MATT: 16 wisdom?

03:17:29.711 --> 03:17:31.420
LIAM: 16 wisdom.

03:17:31.420 --> 03:17:36.531
MATT: You got it. For that one, five.

03:17:36.532 --> 03:17:38.116
LIAM: It's a cow.

03:17:38.116 --> 03:17:45.014
MATT: (laughs) All right. I don't have a
cow mini on me at the moment.

03:17:45.015 --> 03:17:46.358
TALIESIN: My god, man.

03:17:46.358 --> 03:17:47.648
MARISHA: How dare you.

03:17:47.648 --> 03:17:51.498
MATT: I know. How fucking dare I?
I'll use this horse.

03:17:51.498 --> 03:17:54.542
LIAM: You call yourself a dungeon master? Jesus.

03:17:54.542 --> 03:17:58.939
MATT: So the fire giant suddenly (swoosh) (moo).

03:17:58.939 --> 03:18:01.665
ALL: (yelling) Go! Run!

03:18:01.665 --> 03:18:03.672
TRAVIS: We break out. Yasha and I run.

03:18:03.672 --> 03:18:07.100
MATT: The one over here goes and looks
confused at that.

03:18:07.100 --> 03:18:11.401
Everyone needs to roll initiative on this
because you're entered official combat.

03:18:11.401 --> 03:18:14.075
MARISHA: (singing) Don't fuck me, Gil.

03:18:14.075 --> 03:18:22.136
LIAM: Oh my god. One. Well, wait, no. There's
no natural ones in initiative. That's a three.

03:18:22.136 --> 03:18:23.519
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:18:23.519 --> 03:18:24.449
ALL: Eyy!

03:18:24.449 --> 03:18:27.051
MATT: All righty. 25 to 20.

03:18:27.051 --> 03:18:29.538
LAURA: 20 plus four. 24.

03:18:29.538 --> 03:18:30.722
MARISHA: 26.

03:18:30.722 --> 03:18:32.029
MATT: Damn, Beau.

03:18:32.029 --> 03:18:33.922
MARISHA: I'm going to burn my boots.

03:18:33.922 --> 03:18:37.887
MATT: All right. 20 to 15.

03:18:37.887 --> 03:18:38.909
TALIESIN: 18.

03:18:38.909 --> 03:18:39.889
TRAVIS: 19.

03:18:39.889 --> 03:18:45.871
LIAM: If anyone attacks the cow, I'm going to
beat you up in the lobby tonight. Don't do it.

03:18:45.871 --> 03:18:47.951
LAURA: Who would attack the cow?

03:18:47.951 --> 03:18:49.358
MATT: 15 to ten?

03:18:49.358 --> 03:18:51.698
TRAVIS: Yasha hates cows.

03:18:51.698 --> 03:18:53.210
MATT: No one 15 to ten?

03:18:53.210 --> 03:18:55.556
LIAM: (like Yasha) A cow killed my wife.

03:18:55.556 --> 03:18:57.179
LAURA: What did Yasha roll?

03:18:57.179 --> 03:18:58.136
TRAVIS: Nine.

03:18:58.136 --> 03:18:59.374
MATT: All right. So Yasha's at nine?

03:18:59.374 --> 03:19:00.155
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:19:00.155 --> 03:19:01.671
SAM: Seven.

03:19:01.671 --> 03:19:07.249
LAURA: Hey, Caleb. Polymorph happens
immediately so you can do it again.

03:19:07.249 --> 03:19:09.611
MATT: Caleb at three.

03:19:09.612 --> 03:19:11.292
LAURA: Oh, you're at the bottom.

03:19:11.292 --> 03:19:13.484
LIAM: Yeah. It's concentration.

03:19:13.484 --> 03:19:15.553
MATT: All right. Beau, you're up first.

03:19:15.553 --> 03:19:19.752
MARISHA: I am hauling ass across the bridge.

03:19:19.752 --> 03:19:22.255
MATT: All right. (counting)

03:19:22.255 --> 03:19:24.155
SAM: Oh no, the giant totally sees you.

03:19:24.155 --> 03:19:28.356
MARISHA: Step of the wind, step of the wind, step
of the wind!

03:19:28.356 --> 03:19:31.680
MATT: As a bonus action. (counting)

03:19:31.680 --> 03:19:35.880
MARISHA: I get to move 45 feet-- is my movement,
so add ten more to both of those.

03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:37.607
MATT: Oh, right. It's actually ten more,
and you still have your action.

03:19:37.607 --> 03:19:42.912
MARISHA: I don't want to get close to that guy.
I'm going to parkour, and then action to run

03:19:42.912 --> 03:19:48.720
again, but I'm going to swing a little wide.
I don't want to fuck with this guy.

03:19:48.721 --> 03:19:53.628
MATT and MARISHA: (counting)

03:19:53.628 --> 03:20:00.167
MATT: Beau goes (swoosh) and is already on the
opposite side. The giant with the shields goes,

03:20:00.442 --> 03:20:06.981
(exasperated grunt) and goes to go for a shove and
watches her vanish and goes, (confused grunt)

03:20:06.981 --> 03:20:10.509
and looks back at the tunnel on the other side.
She completely just skids off, no effect.

03:20:10.509 --> 03:20:12.213
LIAM: Usain Bolt just comes (swoosh).

03:20:12.213 --> 03:20:14.758
TALIESIN: I'm also un-Polymorphed
over there, as well.

03:20:14.830 --> 03:20:17.592
MARISHA: When we get to the other side,
I smack Caduceus.

03:20:17.592 --> 03:20:18.968
TALIESIN: Just squeeze. That's all you've got to--

03:20:18.968 --> 03:20:21.783
MATT: Okay, so you go, (smacking and falling)
and Caduceus suddenly apparates

03:20:21.783 --> 03:20:27.180
next to you, almost collapsing you from
the weight of his much larger body.

03:20:27.180 --> 03:20:28.164
TALIESIN: Hi.

03:20:28.164 --> 03:20:29.696
MARISHA: All right, get off.

03:20:29.696 --> 03:20:32.321
MATT: You got it, all right. That finishes
your go. Jester, you're up.

03:20:32.321 --> 03:20:38.370
LAURA: I'm going to run up, grab Caleb and
Dimension Door to the other side.

03:20:38.370 --> 03:20:42.987
MATT: All right. (swoosh) On the other
side of the tunnel.

03:20:42.987 --> 03:20:44.623
SAM: Oh no, it's just us.

03:20:44.623 --> 03:20:47.684
MATT: All right, that finishes Jester's go.
Fjord, you're up.

03:20:47.684 --> 03:20:50.259
TRAVIS: I need Yasha.

03:20:50.259 --> 03:20:55.693
LAURA: Nugget's going to run and starts running
out and fucking blinking as well, oh my god!

03:20:55.694 --> 03:20:57.624
TRAVIS: (poofing)

03:20:57.624 --> 03:20:59.859
MATT: There we go. Got me a horse.

03:20:59.859 --> 03:21:01.272
MARISHA: What is happening?

03:21:01.272 --> 03:21:04.060
LIAM: (barking, poofing)

03:21:04.060 --> 03:21:09.301
MATT: Nugget comes out. Blink dogs have
a movement of 40, so that's (counting).

03:21:09.301 --> 03:21:10.563
LAURA: Oh no, he's so cute.

03:21:10.563 --> 03:21:12.460
SAM: Oh, that's pretty fast.

03:21:12.967 --> 03:21:15.888
MATT: He's going to do action to run as well,
(counting) and then is going to use his

03:21:15.888 --> 03:21:35.131
teleport ability, which he gets to teleport
40 feet. Gets right there. (panting, teleporting).

03:21:35.203 --> 03:21:39.940
That finishes your go. Fjord,
what are you doing?

03:21:39.940 --> 03:21:44.089
TRAVIS: Fjord's going to run out and hug to the
right, and he's going to head in this direction

03:21:44.089 --> 03:21:47.260
towards the magma river and go:
Yasha, come on!

03:21:47.260 --> 03:21:48.515
MATT: All right.

03:21:48.516 --> 03:21:54.872
TRAVIS: 30 feet, okay. That's it. Awesome.
Yeah, and I will hold Thunder Step

03:21:54.872 --> 03:21:57.524
until Yasha is next to me.

03:21:57.524 --> 03:22:03.225
MATT: You got it. All righty.
That ends your turn?

03:22:03.225 --> 03:22:04.139
TRAVIS: It does.

03:22:04.139 --> 03:22:05.366
MARISHA: She's next, right? No?

03:22:05.366 --> 03:22:06.888
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

03:22:06.888 --> 03:22:09.239
TALIESIN: I'm going to poke my head out
and cast Blindness on the giant.

03:22:09.239 --> 03:22:12.995
MATT: (counting) You get there to cast it?

03:22:12.995 --> 03:22:13.856
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:22:13.856 --> 03:22:16.012
MATT: All right. What's the DC on that?

03:22:16.013 --> 03:22:17.622
TALIESIN: 16 constitution.

03:22:17.622 --> 03:22:24.412
MATT: Constitution. 26. They got a lot of
constitution, these fire giants.

03:22:24.412 --> 03:22:25.836
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. It was a good thought.

03:22:25.837 --> 03:22:27.269
MATT: Sorry.

03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:29.496
TALIESIN: That's all right. No, it was worth
the thought. I've got a bonus action,

03:22:29.496 --> 03:22:30.586
I suppose, still.

03:22:30.586 --> 03:22:31.395
MATT: You do.

03:22:31.395 --> 03:22:39.554
TALIESIN: Where have I got my bonus actions?
Just for fun, let's give him some more bees.

03:22:39.554 --> 03:22:45.588
(knocking) Wake up again, guys. I'm going
to cast the swarm right in his face.

03:22:45.588 --> 03:22:47.441
MATT: Isn't that once per long rest, though?

03:22:47.442 --> 03:22:49.575
TALIESIN: We took a long rest since
the last time I used that.

03:22:49.575 --> 03:22:51.281
LAURA: With the-- oh, we did!

03:22:51.281 --> 03:22:54.211
MATT: You did, I believe. That's right.
All righty.

03:22:54.211 --> 03:22:55.817
TALIESIN: It's been a while.

03:22:55.817 --> 03:22:58.067
MATT: The beetles scatter and go--

03:22:58.067 --> 03:22:59.324
TALIESIN: I think it's been a long rest.

03:22:59.324 --> 03:23:01.714
MATT: It has been, yeah. I was thinking of the
kobolds, but no. It was earlier, before that.

03:23:01.714 --> 03:23:03.635
SAM: Your movement's 45?

03:23:03.635 --> 03:23:09.402
TALIESIN: So yeah. That's a swarm of insects
and I think they're going to attack.

03:23:09.402 --> 03:23:10.807
MATT: Go for it.

03:23:10.807 --> 03:23:12.589
SAM: I'll be short 30 feet.

03:23:12.589 --> 03:23:13.897
LAURA: You can go 30 feet?

03:23:13.897 --> 03:23:15.619
SAM: No. I'll be short 30 feet.

03:23:15.619 --> 03:23:19.635
TALIESIN: That's-- oh god, that is terrible.
It's eight, nine, ten, 11. That's 11 to hit?

03:23:19.635 --> 03:23:26.482
MATT: They're attacking the shield, and it's
burning up the beetles because it's a flaming shield.

03:23:26.482 --> 03:23:29.117
TALIESIN: I was going to try to get them
on the face, but--

03:23:29.117 --> 03:23:31.707
MATT: Right. They couldn't quite get there.
There's so much shield for it to get to.

03:23:31.707 --> 03:23:33.613
(sizzling)

03:23:33.613 --> 03:23:35.448
TRAVIS: Yeah, just popping.

03:23:35.448 --> 03:23:41.107
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm going to pop back in
all the way as far as I can, against the wall.

03:23:41.107 --> 03:23:43.682
MATT: You popped out and-- this is
the wall here. This is a tunnel.

03:23:43.682 --> 03:23:45.396
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Yeah.

03:23:45.396 --> 03:23:54.547
MATT: For better appearance here.
There, that's the tunnel. All righty.

03:23:54.547 --> 03:23:58.402
That finishes Caduceus' turn.
It is now the fire giants' turn.

03:23:58.402 --> 03:23:59.654
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:23:59.654 --> 03:24:11.356
MATT: Seeing Fjord there. (counting)

03:24:11.356 --> 03:24:13.138
SAM: Oh, that's lava. He can't walk in there.

03:24:13.139 --> 03:24:16.667
LAURA: He is going straight through the lava?
But there's a bridge!

03:24:16.667 --> 03:24:19.022
MARISHA: Fuck bridges.

03:24:19.022 --> 03:24:22.366
MATT: He's going to go ahead-- he doesn't know
if he's going to have enough range for it.

03:24:22.366 --> 03:24:24.430
He's going to attempt his shield charge.

03:24:24.430 --> 03:24:26.842
SAM: Shield charge.

03:24:26.842 --> 03:24:37.401
MATT: No, actually. It's going to instead
cruise up 30 up to that point and

03:24:37.401 --> 03:24:42.818
it's going to grab a rock off the ground
and chuck it straight at you, Fjord.

03:24:42.819 --> 03:24:44.447
TRAVIS: Like a rock, or like a rock?

03:24:44.447 --> 03:24:46.522
MATT: Like a rock. It's about
the size of your torso.

03:24:46.522 --> 03:24:47.690
TRAVIS: Just wanted to check.

03:24:47.690 --> 03:24:49.949
MATT: It reaches off the side, and it's been
sitting next to the lava and it's actually

03:24:49.949 --> 03:24:53.656
orange on one side from the nearby heat.
Picks it up-- drops the shield

03:24:53.656 --> 03:24:57.236
for a second, picks it up and (swoosh)
lobs it right towards you.

03:24:57.236 --> 03:24:58.974
LIAM: Princess Bride moment.

03:24:58.974 --> 03:25:04.822
MATT: Oh, that's going to be 32 to hit.

03:25:04.822 --> 03:25:05.834
SAM: To hit?

03:25:05.834 --> 03:25:06.694
MATT: Yeah.

03:25:06.694 --> 03:25:07.569
LIAM: Holy shit.

03:25:07.569 --> 03:25:08.669
TRAVIS: Oh no.

03:25:08.669 --> 03:25:09.600
SAM: Miss.

03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:12.493
TRAVIS: (explosion) Fjord just explodes.

03:25:12.493 --> 03:25:13.949
LIAM: Just powder.

03:25:13.949 --> 03:25:16.388
TRAVIS: The second splat on the fucking ground.

03:25:16.388 --> 03:25:20.135
MATT: You can't tell where Fjord ends
and Spurt begins.

03:25:20.135 --> 03:25:22.594
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. That definitely hits.

03:25:22.595 --> 03:25:27.397
MATT: Oh, fuck. All right, that is 34
points of bludgeoning damage.

03:25:27.397 --> 03:25:28.844
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:25:28.844 --> 03:25:30.319
MATT: I need you to make a concentration check.

03:25:30.319 --> 03:25:31.968
MARISHA and LAURA: What?

03:25:31.968 --> 03:25:33.580
MATT: Because you are currently
holding your spell.

03:25:33.580 --> 03:25:34.584
SAM: Polymorph.

03:25:34.585 --> 03:25:39.651
MATT: No, not Polymorph. He's holding-- like,
when you begin casting your Thunder Step.

03:25:39.651 --> 03:25:43.129
TRAVIS: Constitution check or saving throw?

03:25:43.130 --> 03:25:49.373
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw, and you
have to have half of 34, that puts it at 17.

03:25:49.373 --> 03:25:53.252
The DC of 17 you have to beat
to maintain concentration.

03:25:53.252 --> 03:26:02.019
TRAVIS: 20. That was going to be a
plan ruiner for the second time.

03:26:02.019 --> 03:26:06.255
MATT: The boulder slams into you and for a
minute your lights just go white.

03:26:06.255 --> 03:26:12.577
Your eyes go to complete and utter absence
of image; just the color white. The pain

03:26:12.577 --> 03:26:17.672
streaks through you. You can feel the burning
scrape of when it impacted your forehead,

03:26:17.672 --> 03:26:20.966
and as soon as you right yourself, you look
down and the spell begins to fade from your

03:26:20.966 --> 03:26:25.029
fingertips, and you just barely hold on to it.
It's like rocketing in your hands.

03:26:25.029 --> 03:26:28.449
You can see the energy and the thunderous
power beginning to build in your palm.

03:26:28.449 --> 03:26:32.846
That finishes that giant's turn.
The cow's going to move.

03:26:32.846 --> 03:26:36.364
SAM and LIAM: It's going to moo-ve?

03:26:36.364 --> 03:26:41.440
MATT: Oh god. All right, I don't have
movement for a cow here.

03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:43.428
SAM: Probably 15 feet?

03:26:43.428 --> 03:26:45.140
TRAVIS: Bison, Buffalo?

03:26:45.141 --> 03:26:48.239
LIAM: "Speed 40 feet" is what the internet
is telling me.

03:26:48.239 --> 03:26:49.453
MARISHA: No way.

03:26:49.453 --> 03:26:52.018
SAM: Cows can--? I mean, they're fast.
They have four legs.

03:26:52.018 --> 03:26:53.249
MATT: Yeah, dude, they can move.

03:26:53.249 --> 03:26:54.245
TRAVIS: (mooing)

03:26:54.246 --> 03:26:58.059
MATT: Hold on. Cow. There it is:
"Large beast, 30 feet"

03:26:58.059 --> 03:27:00.281
SAM: (singing) What does the cow say?

03:27:00.281 --> 03:27:04.258
MATT and TRAVIS: (counting)

03:27:04.258 --> 03:27:05.448
TRAVIS: Jesus.

03:27:05.448 --> 03:27:07.635
MATT: The cow's going to go ahead
and attempt to attack you.

03:27:07.635 --> 03:27:10.879
LIAM: Just let it happen. Just let it happen.

03:27:10.879 --> 03:27:14.231
TRAVIS: (ramming) Bitch slap a cow.

03:27:14.231 --> 03:27:15.584
MATT: 21 to hit. What's your armor class?

03:27:15.585 --> 03:27:16.944
TRAVIS: That hits.

03:27:16.944 --> 03:27:18.735
LAURA: The cow gets you?

03:27:18.735 --> 03:27:19.975
SAM: With what?

03:27:19.975 --> 03:27:21.544
TRAVIS: They got big-ass teeth.

03:27:21.544 --> 03:27:26.107
MATT: You take eight points of piercing
damage as the cow gores you with its horn.

03:27:26.107 --> 03:27:29.162
I need you to make another constitution
saving throw.

03:27:29.162 --> 03:27:32.419
TRAVIS: Another constitution saving throw?

03:27:32.419 --> 03:27:34.437
MATT: Correct. It's DC ten.

03:27:34.437 --> 03:27:37.781
TRAVIS: Okay, all right. Come on, come on.
Natural 20.

03:27:37.782 --> 03:27:40.841
MATT: Oh my god! Damn it.

03:27:40.841 --> 03:27:43.849
LIAM: Take 30 points of cow damage.

03:27:43.849 --> 03:27:47.128
TRAVIS: Next time, you specify dairy cow.

03:27:47.128 --> 03:27:48.947
MARISHA: This has been too much.

03:27:48.947 --> 03:27:50.595
MATT: Yasha's turn.

03:27:50.596 --> 03:27:59.148
TRAVIS: Yasha will use 40 feet of movement to run
past the cow to come into contact with Fjord.

03:27:59.148 --> 03:28:02.175
SAM: Does the cow get an attack of cow-portunity?

03:28:02.175 --> 03:28:05.992
TALIESIN: The cow is going to probably
turn back into a giant when they move.

03:28:05.992 --> 03:28:09.554
MATT: She just barely makes it around with
her 40 feet of movement to get to you,

03:28:09.554 --> 03:28:12.592
the cow now blocking that space that she
was going to run through.

03:28:12.592 --> 03:28:14.183
TRAVIS: Does the cow get an attack of
opportunity?

03:28:14.183 --> 03:28:16.006
MATT: No, she hasn't left the cow's melee range.

03:28:16.006 --> 03:28:17.099
TRAVIS: I understand.

03:28:17.099 --> 03:28:19.040
MATT: Yasha runs up to you and--

03:28:19.041 --> 03:28:22.594
TRAVIS: Fjord summons the falchion and
stabs it into the ground casting

03:28:22.594 --> 03:28:25.830
Thunder Step and will go 90 feet
in the direction of the tunnel.

03:28:25.830 --> 03:28:29.615
MARISHA: How many times have we said cow
in the past 30 seconds?

03:28:29.615 --> 03:28:33.744
MATT: Yeah, you guys appear already
in the tunnel across the way.

03:28:33.744 --> 03:28:35.215
SAM: That didn't damage the cow at all,
did it?

03:28:35.215 --> 03:28:38.360
MATT: It does.

03:28:38.360 --> 03:28:42.666
TRAVIS: It does. It does 3d10
thunder damage.

03:28:42.666 --> 03:28:44.119
LAURA: Low damage to the cow.

03:28:44.119 --> 03:28:45.456
TRAVIS: I forgot about that.

03:28:45.456 --> 03:28:47.399
LAURA: Roll three ones, three ones.

03:28:47.400 --> 03:28:51.934
TRAVIS: (counting) 20 points
of thunder damage.

03:28:51.934 --> 03:28:53.428
MATT: Is there a save?

03:28:53.428 --> 03:28:57.610
MARISHA: Is the cow super dexy?

03:28:57.610 --> 03:28:59.190
TRAVIS: Constitution 16.

03:28:59.190 --> 03:29:01.441
SAM and MARISHA: Cow-stitution.

03:29:01.441 --> 03:29:03.307
MATT: 13, fail. Takes 20 damage.

03:29:03.307 --> 03:29:05.578
TRAVIS: Actually, it takes 22 damage.

03:29:05.578 --> 03:29:06.692
MATT: (poof)

03:29:06.692 --> 03:29:08.595
LAURA and TALIESIN: No!

03:29:08.595 --> 03:29:12.212
MATT: The cow form is sundered as the
thunder blast destroys its Polymorph form

03:29:12.212 --> 03:29:18.405
and then, (grunt) emerging from it: the
second fire giant, pissed off, &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; angry.

03:29:18.405 --> 03:29:22.329
But that does carry over seven points
of thunder damage to the fire giant.

03:29:22.329 --> 03:29:24.196
TRAVIS: Hey! All right.

03:29:24.196 --> 03:29:26.291
MARISHA: What did we do?

03:29:26.292 --> 03:29:28.430
MATT: All right, that finishes Yasha's turn.
Nott, you're up.

03:29:28.430 --> 03:29:30.474
SAM: What the fuck?

03:29:30.474 --> 03:29:34.100
MARISHA: Nott's the only one!

03:29:34.100 --> 03:29:36.218
TRAVIS: Super invisible, right?

03:29:36.218 --> 03:29:37.519
LAURA: You're invisible.

03:29:37.519 --> 03:29:38.173
SAM: Yeah.

03:29:38.173 --> 03:29:39.737
LAURA: And I blessed you.

03:29:39.737 --> 03:29:41.199
SAM: Sure, what does that do again?

03:29:41.199 --> 03:29:42.731
LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth.

03:29:42.731 --> 03:29:45.324
LIAM: That just means you're going to Bilbo Baggins
your way across this bridge, motherfucker!

03:29:45.324 --> 03:29:47.319
LAURA and TRAVIS: Take your time.

03:29:47.319 --> 03:29:48.839
SAM: Okay, I will stealthily--

03:29:48.839 --> 03:29:50.008
LAURA: How long can you stay invisible?

03:29:50.008 --> 03:29:51.895
SAM: One minute. I will stealthily emerge--

03:29:51.895 --> 03:29:53.478
MATT: So you've already cast Invisibility
on yourself?

03:29:53.478 --> 03:29:55.824
SAM: Yes. It's probably been one round now.

03:29:55.824 --> 03:29:57.234
MATT: There you go.

03:29:57.234 --> 03:29:59.885
MARISHA: You have to get across that
bridge, right? There is no other way?

03:29:59.885 --> 03:30:03.841
MATT: Your speed is now 35, because
you took the halfling feat.

03:30:03.841 --> 03:30:08.838
SAM: Correct. I will stealthily make
my way to the bridge, around the--

03:30:08.838 --> 03:30:17.746
MATT: So if you're moving at full speed--
the stealth rules, looking this up right here.

03:30:17.747 --> 03:30:25.431
As you're invisible, "Impossible to see--
The creature's location can be detected by

03:30:25.431 --> 03:30:28.480
"any noise it makes, tracks it leaves--"
So still means stealth check, but you have

03:30:28.480 --> 03:30:31.927
advantage on the stealth check. I believe
if you're moving your full speed

03:30:31.927 --> 03:30:35.804
it's disadvantage on stealth?
I'm trying to remember.

03:30:35.804 --> 03:30:39.876
LAURA: But with Blessing of the Trickster it might
be balanced out, because you get advantage on--

03:30:39.876 --> 03:30:42.777
MATT: If you have disadvantage and advantage
it just cancels out, no matter how much you

03:30:42.777 --> 03:30:46.267
have of each. So it would be just a straight
roll. I'll put it there. That's fine.

03:30:46.267 --> 03:30:49.397
So go ahead and make a stealth check.

03:30:49.398 --> 03:31:03.501
SAM: 15. Not great. Oh wait, I also get-- I have
the hood, the cloak, but it's all canceled out.

03:31:03.501 --> 03:31:14.348
MATT: It all cancels out. So (counting) that's
your movement. As you come through quietly,

03:31:14.348 --> 03:31:23.030
the giant who just appeared goes-- and looks over.
Passive perceptions are 15 and 16. Both giants

03:31:23.030 --> 03:31:27.466
look, and they see footsteps and they're both
like, (grunts). They still don't know-- they know

03:31:27.466 --> 03:31:30.095
the general vicinity where you are. Anything
against you still has disadvantage,

03:31:30.096 --> 03:31:33.442
but it's still your turn. You still have
your bonus action and your attack.

03:31:33.442 --> 03:31:35.762
SAM: Sure. Yeah, I'll just kill them both.

03:31:35.762 --> 03:31:37.360
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

03:31:37.360 --> 03:31:42.614
SAM: I can use an action to dash?

03:31:42.614 --> 03:31:43.563
MATT: Yeah.

03:31:43.563 --> 03:31:49.969
SAM: Okay. I'll action dash, but not up the
bridge. Around the side closest to me.

03:31:49.970 --> 03:31:51.128
MATT: This way?

03:31:51.128 --> 03:31:52.288
SAM: Uh-huh.

03:31:52.288 --> 03:31:57.410
MATT: All right. So five, ten. As soon as the
footsteps are happening, it makes an attack

03:31:57.410 --> 03:32:00.531
of opportunity in your general direction.
It has disadvantage on the attack.

03:32:00.532 --> 03:32:01.871
SAM: Sure. Yeah.

03:32:01.871 --> 03:32:09.357
MATT: So for this here-- this is with
its giant maul. That is a 20 to hit.

03:32:09.582 --> 03:32:11.208
SAM: Sure, that hits.

03:32:11.614 --> 03:32:21.726
MATT: Okay. So it's a giant hammer that's
large enough that sweeps through the

03:32:21.796 --> 03:32:26.479
general area and catches you in the back.
You take--

03:32:26.479 --> 03:32:28.344
TALIESIN: Oh, wow. That's a lot of rolling.

03:32:28.344 --> 03:32:30.055
LAURA: Does that drop your invisibility
once you're hit?

03:32:30.055 --> 03:32:31.732
SAM: Oh, yeah. I think so.

03:32:31.732 --> 03:32:33.487
LIAM: Don't kill my goblin, Matthew.

03:32:33.488 --> 03:32:35.546
MATT: 28 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:32:35.546 --> 03:32:37.990
SAM: I'll do whatever you call it to halve that.

03:32:37.990 --> 03:32:41.190
MATT: Okay, so you use your reaction, so
that makes it a 14. Go ahead and make a

03:32:41.191 --> 03:32:44.779
constitution saving throw, DC ten, to try and
maintain concentration on Invisibility.

03:32:44.779 --> 03:32:46.680
SAM: Oh, it doesn't just automatically drop?

03:32:46.680 --> 03:32:49.589
MATT: No.

03:32:49.589 --> 03:32:52.204
SAM: What kind of check?

03:32:52.204 --> 03:32:53.711
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

03:32:53.712 --> 03:32:55.090
SAM: Ten.

03:32:55.090 --> 03:32:57.484
MATT: You just barely maintain concentration.
That was the base DC.

03:32:57.484 --> 03:32:58.918
TRAVIS: You maintain?

03:32:58.918 --> 03:33:01.597
LAURA: Yeah, she's still invisible.

03:33:01.757 --> 03:33:04.863
MATT: 15, 20, 25. You still have ten more
feet of movement there.

03:33:04.863 --> 03:33:06.979
SAM: Under the bridge.

03:33:06.979 --> 03:33:08.837
MATT: Okay.

03:33:08.837 --> 03:33:14.388
SAM: And-- (pained screaming)
I'm coming for you, Spurt!

03:33:14.388 --> 03:33:17.589
MATT: You're under the bridge now.

03:33:17.589 --> 03:33:22.809
SAM: And then I will press my body to
the bridge and bonus action just hide.

03:33:22.810 --> 03:33:26.443
MATT: Go for it. Go ahead and make a
stealth check. This is with advantage.

03:33:26.443 --> 03:33:31.203
SAM: Thank jesus! Terrible.
This is stealth?

03:33:31.330 --> 03:33:32.548
MATT: Yes.

03:33:32.548 --> 03:33:33.796
SAM: 18.

03:33:33.796 --> 03:33:35.854
MATT: 18. Okay.

03:33:35.855 --> 03:33:38.425
TRAVIS: Just wait, just wait. Don't do anything yet.

03:33:38.425 --> 03:33:42.534
MATT: They both saw where you went, but they
don't know exactly where you are.

03:33:42.534 --> 03:33:47.214
That finishes your turn. Caleb, you're up,
if you want to do anything.

03:33:47.214 --> 03:33:54.011
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, I'm going to lean out. I'm going
to extend my middle finger to the giant

03:33:54.107 --> 03:34:00.808
on the bridge, mutter a few arcane words
around my hand, and cast Banishment.

03:34:00.809 --> 03:34:04.173
MATT: Okay. What's the save on that?

03:34:04.173 --> 03:34:09.475
LIAM: 16 charisma. Components are an item
distasteful to the target.

03:34:09.475 --> 03:34:14.800
MATT: Gotcha. Natural 19 plus five. I'm rolling
really fucking good for these guys.

03:34:14.801 --> 03:34:16.630
SAM: Good, that's good.

03:34:16.647 --> 03:34:17.706
MATT: That is ridiculous.

03:34:17.832 --> 03:34:19.389
LAURA: Big fire giants, they are really--

03:34:19.389 --> 03:34:20.934
MATT: They are. That's a plus five--

03:34:20.934 --> 03:34:22.552
TRAVIS: This is vengeance for
the traffic cone guys.

03:34:22.552 --> 03:34:23.835
MATT: There you go.

03:34:23.888 --> 03:34:29.571
LIAM: So for my movement, I am going to just
take a step, not back in, but to the side.

03:34:29.571 --> 03:34:31.183
MATT: There?

03:34:31.184 --> 03:34:34.022
LIAM: Actually, and I will walk--
To the other side of the dog.

03:34:34.022 --> 03:34:35.537
MATT: There?

03:34:35.537 --> 03:34:36.910
LIAM: Yeah, right there.

03:34:36.910 --> 03:34:38.740
MATT: All right. Okay. Is that your turn?

03:34:38.811 --> 03:34:40.903
LIAM: Yeah. And I'm just looking for Nott.

03:34:40.903 --> 03:34:46.321
MATT: You got it. That finishes your go, to the
top. Beau, anything? Are you staying put?

03:34:46.321 --> 03:34:52.500
MARISHA: I am going to peek around
the corner. And I'm going to hold

03:34:52.500 --> 03:35:02.606
my action to run and grab Nott,
if I see her.

03:35:02.606 --> 03:35:04.004
MATT: To what? To--

03:35:04.005 --> 03:35:05.667
MARISHA: To run and grab Nott,
if I see her.

03:35:05.667 --> 03:35:07.930
MATT: Okay, you got it.
That's your action.

03:35:07.930 --> 03:35:09.410
MARISHA: I'll hold, though.

03:35:09.410 --> 03:35:11.236
MATT: Jester, your turn.
You doing anything?

03:35:11.237 --> 03:35:14.537
LAURA: Sure. Yes, I am going to.

03:35:14.537 --> 03:35:16.978
MATT: You're back in the tunnels, so you
have to move out to really get a good view.

03:35:16.978 --> 03:35:20.324
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to just pop my head
and out and see what's happening.

03:35:20.324 --> 03:35:21.772
MATT: All right.

03:35:21.772 --> 03:35:28.985
LAURA: And I'm going to cast... Jesus.

03:35:28.985 --> 03:35:31.063
MATT: Fjord, you're on deck.

03:35:31.063 --> 03:35:32.760
SAM: Cast Jesus.

03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:41.496
LAURA: Fuck. Okay I'm not concentrating
anymore. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

03:35:41.497 --> 03:35:44.976
MATT: Okay. Where are you placing your—

03:35:44.976 --> 03:35:49.020
LAURA: I'm going to send my duplicate
30 feet in front of me.

03:35:49.020 --> 03:35:51.656
MATT: Right there.

03:35:51.656 --> 03:36:00.645
LAURA: And then I'm going to make her run out and
leap over the lava and land on the other side.

03:36:00.645 --> 03:36:04.964
MATT: As it is an illusory duplicate,
it does not need to make a check.

03:36:04.964 --> 03:36:07.145
It just appears to leap and land.

03:36:07.145 --> 03:36:09.550
LAURA: And then she's going to act like
she's readying for the fight

03:36:09.550 --> 03:36:11.524
and getting ready to cast something.

03:36:11.524 --> 03:36:15.752
MATT: Okay. I will say, make
a deception check.

03:36:15.752 --> 03:36:18.140
LAURA: Okay.

03:36:18.140 --> 03:36:21.370
LIAM: Come on, La. Come on.

03:36:21.370 --> 03:36:28.750
LAURA: God fucking dammit. Seven.

03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:31.738
MATT: Okay.

03:36:31.739 --> 03:36:33.468
SAM: I think it worked.

03:36:33.468 --> 03:36:34.956
MATT: That finishes your turn, Jester.

03:36:34.956 --> 03:36:36.735
SAM: Our deceptions are so deceptive.

03:36:36.735 --> 03:36:38.247
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

03:36:38.247 --> 03:36:40.957
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't want to draw
any more attention to the cave,

03:36:40.957 --> 03:36:43.019
because that's where he's got to go.

03:36:43.019 --> 03:36:44.764
SAM: Do not. They haven't found me yet.

03:36:44.765 --> 03:36:48.162
TRAVIS: I'm going to do nothing.
That's my turn.

03:36:48.162 --> 03:36:51.470
MATT: All righty. Caduceus.

03:36:51.471 --> 03:36:59.761
TALIESIN: I am definitely not 30 feet away
from that big mo with the--

03:36:59.761 --> 03:37:01.545
MATT: Nope.

03:37:01.545 --> 03:37:03.647
TALIESIN: I would have to get way out
there to be 30 feet.

03:37:03.647 --> 03:37:05.498
MATT: You would have to get a lot closer
than you are, yes.

03:37:05.498 --> 03:37:07.916
TALIESIN: I am 60 feet away from Nott,
however, correct?

03:37:07.916 --> 03:37:12.238
MATT: You are actually further than
60 feet from Nott.

03:37:12.238 --> 03:37:14.922
TALIESIN: But getting 60 feet
from Nott is not--

03:37:14.922 --> 03:37:18.406
MATT: Not too bad. You can move 15 feet
and get pretty close.

03:37:18.406 --> 03:37:19.783
TALIESIN: And then hop back in.

03:37:19.783 --> 03:37:22.132
MATT: You could do that, yes.

03:37:22.132 --> 03:37:24.999
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to
hop out and--

03:37:24.999 --> 03:37:26.762
LAURA: You don't know where Nott went.

03:37:26.763 --> 03:37:28.563
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. I don't know
where Nott is, do I?

03:37:28.563 --> 03:37:31.808
MATT: Yeah. You walk out and go--
And don't see Nott.

03:37:31.809 --> 03:37:33.908
TALIESIN: Then I would have just...

03:37:33.908 --> 03:37:36.359
TRAVIS: You going to join me
on the nope train?

03:37:36.359 --> 03:37:38.233
TALIESIN: I'm going to be
on the nope train.

03:37:38.233 --> 03:37:39.931
MATT: All right, do you move back in?

03:37:39.931 --> 03:37:41.518
TALIESIN: Yeah. In fact, if anything--

03:37:41.518 --> 03:37:43.875
LAURA: You could prep a healing for
when you see Nott.

03:37:43.875 --> 03:37:46.235
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to hold
a healing spell for--

03:37:46.235 --> 03:37:48.125
MATT: What spell?

03:37:48.125 --> 03:37:50.746
TALIESIN: Oh, just Cure Wounds.
Just the bonus action one.

03:37:50.747 --> 03:38:00.096
MATT: You got it. Okay, now it's their turn.
The dreadnaught is going to step off there

03:38:00.096 --> 03:38:04.489
and use its shield charge against the bridge.

03:38:04.661 --> 03:38:10.032
Stepping forward and slamming
into the stone there.

03:38:10.188 --> 03:38:13.354
TRAVIS: But my fake manticore is
still flying around!

03:38:13.399 --> 03:38:16.277
MATT: It is. And there's a lot of people
really confused out by that citadel.

03:38:16.277 --> 03:38:18.384
SAM: (screeching)

03:38:18.384 --> 03:38:21.654
TRAVIS: Whatever that citadel is.
We should go attack the citadel.

03:38:21.654 --> 03:38:24.774
MATT: Ooh.

03:38:24.775 --> 03:38:27.953
LIAM: Fuck our culture.

03:38:27.953 --> 03:38:34.204
MATT: The whole bridge comes crashing down.

03:38:34.204 --> 03:38:36.075
LIAM: Oh, man.

03:38:36.076 --> 03:38:40.031
MATT: Into the lava there. This bridge part
collapses. Nott, I need you to make

03:38:40.031 --> 03:38:41.842
a dexterity check. Or saving throw, please.

03:38:41.976 --> 03:38:43.918
LAURA: Saving throw.

03:38:43.918 --> 03:38:45.895
SAM: 19.

03:38:45.895 --> 03:38:50.258
MATT: 19. You avoid some of the damage.
You manage to just skitter out of the way.

03:38:50.258 --> 03:38:57.679
So you take half. That puts you at, it would be
14 down to 7 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:38:57.679 --> 03:39:01.120
LAURA: If she would have rolled a one,
would she be in the lava?

03:39:01.121 --> 03:39:09.548
MATT: Yeah. So pushes into this area, knocks
the bridge over, continues the movement

03:39:09.548 --> 03:39:16.020
into that point there. This one here is
going to go ahead and move forward.

03:39:16.020 --> 03:39:20.524
SAM: Do I have to make a concentration check?

03:39:20.524 --> 03:39:22.447
MATT: You do, yes.

03:39:22.447 --> 03:39:24.309
SAM: 18.

03:39:24.310 --> 03:39:31.690
MATT: You're fine. And it's going to use its action
try to perceive you. It has no idea where you are.

03:39:31.810 --> 03:39:37.856
That is total-- you rolled an 18, right?

03:39:37.856 --> 03:39:39.532
SAM: I believe so.

03:39:39.533 --> 03:39:41.455
MATT: Still cannot see you.

03:39:41.455 --> 03:39:43.789
TRAVIS: What's your jumping distance?

03:39:43.789 --> 03:39:45.667
MATT: All right. Yasha's turn. Anything?

03:39:45.667 --> 03:39:47.725
TRAVIS: Negative. Nope train.

03:39:47.852 --> 03:39:49.893
MATT: Yasha's staying put.
Nott, your turn.

03:39:49.893 --> 03:39:55.490
SAM: I close my eyes and imagine my beautiful
husband waiting for me, needing me,

03:39:55.490 --> 03:39:58.942
and I run across the lava.

03:39:58.943 --> 03:40:00.519
LAURA: No.

03:40:00.519 --> 03:40:02.558
SAM: With my ring of water walking.

03:40:02.558 --> 03:40:10.109
MATT: Okay. You can do it. You can.
You run across. (burning)

03:40:10.109 --> 03:40:13.639
SAM: Not right at the giant.
I'll go around in a--

03:40:13.639 --> 03:40:15.970
LAURA: Can you leap on the
crumbled bridge parts?

03:40:15.970 --> 03:40:17.592
SAM: Sure, I'll try to leap on some rocks.

03:40:17.592 --> 03:40:20.441
MATT: It's up to you. Are you going to
try and leap across?

03:40:20.441 --> 03:40:22.554
SAM: Are there chunks in the water?

03:40:22.554 --> 03:40:25.871
MATT: Yes, there is one chunk here that is
splashing and hasn't sunken in yet.

03:40:25.872 --> 03:40:28.045
SAM: All right. I'll do that.

03:40:28.045 --> 03:40:31.094
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an
athletics check, we'll say, just to try and--

03:40:31.095 --> 03:40:32.818
SAM: Just a check?

03:40:32.818 --> 03:40:34.240
MATT: Yep.

03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:37.067
SAM: Ten.

03:40:37.240 --> 03:40:42.494
MATT: That's fine. That's the base you needed.
(swish) Making it across this way. As you rush

03:40:42.494 --> 03:40:47.333
across, though, the movement catches its
attention. It gets an attack of opportunity

03:40:47.333 --> 03:40:56.929
on you. However, it's at disadvantage on
the attack. So that would be 17 to hit.

03:40:56.929 --> 03:41:00.370
SAM: My armor class, as of today, is 18.

03:41:00.370 --> 03:41:04.693
TRAVIS: Because of the level up?

03:41:04.693 --> 03:41:06.356
SAM: Yeah.

03:41:06.356 --> 03:41:08.349
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:41:08.349 --> 03:41:13.925
MATT: As soon as you rush up and leap in the air,
it sees the push off of rocks and backhands with

03:41:13.926 --> 03:41:20.197
the hammer, and as it swings out you pull your
legs up and it just barely (swoosh) misses from

03:41:20.197 --> 03:41:24.777
beneath your feet as you tuck them closer to
your chest and land on that rock piece there.

03:41:24.777 --> 03:41:29.418
So that's (counting). You can attempt
one more jump.

03:41:29.418 --> 03:41:31.308
SAM: Absolutely.

03:41:31.308 --> 03:41:32.808
MATT: Athletics check.

03:41:32.808 --> 03:41:36.129
SAM: Less. It's nine.

03:41:36.129 --> 03:41:42.498
MATT: Nine. (burning sound) So the good
news is you don't (splash) into it,

03:41:42.498 --> 03:41:48.679
because lava doesn't really work that way.
However, it's a lot of fire damage.

03:41:48.679 --> 03:41:54.089
Yeah, I'm trying to remember
where that is.

03:41:54.089 --> 03:41:57.956
TALIESIN: You get to keep
moving though, right?

03:41:57.956 --> 03:42:00.460
LIAM: This is what happened the last time
we went to the Underdark.

03:42:00.460 --> 03:42:02.214
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah!

03:42:02.214 --> 03:42:03.131
MATT: Yeah, it is.

03:42:03.132 --> 03:42:05.601
TALIESIN: Man, you had to regrow a leg.

03:42:05.601 --> 03:42:07.064
MATT: That's right!

03:42:07.064 --> 03:42:08.967
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's going to
happen again!

03:42:08.967 --> 03:42:12.751
MATT: Okay, pardon me here--

03:42:12.751 --> 03:42:15.043
TRAVIS: What is that citadel?

03:42:15.043 --> 03:42:20.271
LIAM: It's just where these people
live, man.

03:42:20.271 --> 03:42:22.316
MATT: It's not in that book.

03:42:22.316 --> 03:42:24.188
SAM: Other beautiful book.

03:42:24.188 --> 03:42:25.964
LIAM: But they are really gorgeous
to look at.

03:42:25.964 --> 03:42:28.237
SAM: Chris Perkins, ladies and gentlemen.

03:42:28.238 --> 03:42:30.749
LIAM: Yeah, hats off. Great books.

03:42:30.749 --> 03:42:33.539
SAM: Book designer. Lead book designer.

03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:36.172
LAURA: Lava fire damage is what
you're looking up right now?

03:42:36.172 --> 03:42:40.149
MATT: Yeah, it's all good.
Thank you, Google.

03:42:40.149 --> 03:42:42.750
LAURA: I remember this being
ludicrously horrible.

03:42:42.750 --> 03:42:44.648
MATT: It's pretty bad. It's pretty bad.

03:42:44.649 --> 03:42:46.230
TALIESIN: It's going to be fine.

03:42:46.230 --> 03:42:49.419
LIAM: It took several days of Pike
giving me good mojo to heal.

03:42:49.419 --> 03:42:51.682
LAURA: And that was before we
did the full lava damage.

03:42:51.682 --> 03:42:54.329
MATT: On page 249 of the
Dungeon Master's Guide.

03:42:54.329 --> 03:42:55.674
LIAM: Holy shite.

03:42:55.675 --> 03:42:57.136
SAM: Did Chris just say that?

03:42:57.136 --> 03:42:58.472
LAURA: Yeah.

03:42:58.472 --> 03:42:59.964
MATT: Bless you.

03:42:59.964 --> 03:43:02.961
TALIESIN: Monster! I got a plan.

03:43:02.962 --> 03:43:05.137
LAURA: I got a better plan.

03:43:05.137 --> 03:43:08.173
TALIESIN: I got a plan. Everything's
going to be fine.

03:43:08.173 --> 03:43:09.676
SAM: Sure.

03:43:09.676 --> 03:43:11.217
TALIESIN: I got a plan.

03:43:11.217 --> 03:43:13.117
LAURA: Do you have the ability
to roll back time?

03:43:13.117 --> 03:43:14.573
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:43:14.573 --> 03:43:17.037
TRAVIS: (singing) If I could turn back time.

03:43:17.037 --> 03:43:22.282
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (singing) If I could
find a way.

03:43:22.441 --> 03:43:30.533
MATT: All right. Your foot hits the edge
and just skips. You fall back and land

03:43:30.533 --> 03:43:37.107
and hit the lava on your back and legs.
The ring keeps you from sinking into it,

03:43:37.107 --> 03:43:41.806
so I'm not giving you full submerged
damage, so you don't take the full 18d10.

03:43:41.806 --> 03:43:48.210
(shocked screaming)

03:43:48.210 --> 03:43:50.664
LIAM: Don't you take my goblin mom away!

03:43:50.732 --> 03:43:52.555
TRAVIS: 9d10?

03:43:52.555 --> 03:43:54.637
MARISHA: Yeah, is that 9d10?

03:43:54.637 --> 03:43:56.040
MATT: It is.

03:43:56.040 --> 03:43:57.862
TRAVIS: (chanting) Ones! Ones!

03:43:57.862 --> 03:44:00.266
SAM: If he rolls a one on all of them,
I'll be okay.

03:44:00.266 --> 03:44:04.158
MARISHA: Are you full health?

03:44:04.158 --> 03:44:05.688
TALIESIN: No.

03:44:05.688 --> 03:44:07.528
LIAM: It's going to be around 45.

03:44:07.528 --> 03:44:09.300
MARISHA: Because you got baseball-batted.

03:44:09.300 --> 03:44:10.890
TRAVIS: He's counting.

03:44:10.890 --> 03:44:12.385
LIAM: What's your full HP?

03:44:12.385 --> 03:44:13.804
SAM: I'm not at full HP.

03:44:13.804 --> 03:44:15.626
LIAM: Oh shit. It's got to be low then
to survive that.

03:44:15.626 --> 03:44:19.925
MATT: 48 points of fire damage.

03:44:19.925 --> 03:44:25.044
SAM: Can I use my whatever it's called--
Uncanny Dodge?

03:44:25.044 --> 03:44:27.408
MATT: It's not an attack.

03:44:27.409 --> 03:44:29.130
SAM: It doesn't work. It's an effect.

03:44:29.130 --> 03:44:31.057
MATT: You can't really dodge the fire.

03:44:31.057 --> 03:44:34.211
TALIESIN: Here's the thing though: I am holding
a healing spell for the second I see him.

03:44:34.211 --> 03:44:36.926
MATT: A Cure Wounds which has to be
up next to him.

03:44:36.926 --> 03:44:38.509
TALIESIN: No, Healing Word. I'm so sorry--

03:44:38.509 --> 03:44:39.945
MATT: You said Cure Wounds earlier--

03:44:39.945 --> 03:44:43.182
TALIESIN: I meant the 60 foot because--
I was trying for the 60 foot range. I am so sorry.

03:44:43.183 --> 03:44:46.895
I said the wrong thing because I was not running
out there. I was going for the 60 foot range.

03:44:46.895 --> 03:44:49.468
SAM: He did say, "I'm within 60 feet of Nott."

03:44:49.468 --> 03:44:53.052
MATT: I'll allow it, all right. I need you to make
a constitution saving throw please.

03:44:53.182 --> 03:44:56.290
SAM: I mean, I'm dead, so--

03:44:56.290 --> 03:44:58.170
TRAVIS: You're unconscious.

03:44:58.170 --> 03:44:59.647
SAM: I'm unconscious.

03:44:59.648 --> 03:45:01.467
MATT: Oh, you're unconscious? Oh, okay.

03:45:01.467 --> 03:45:05.640
TALIESIN: So the second I see--

03:45:05.704 --> 03:45:12.572
MATT: The second Nott falls, you see a burst of
fire and Nott's unconscious body is currently in flames.

03:45:12.572 --> 03:45:14.545
TRAVIS and MATT: Becomes visible.

03:45:14.545 --> 03:45:18.533
TALIESIN: The second Nott is visible, I cast
Cure Wounds. I cast Healing Word. I'm so sorry.

03:45:18.534 --> 03:45:20.470
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll that.

03:45:20.470 --> 03:45:22.105
TALIESIN: I don't have to roll it.

03:45:22.105 --> 03:45:24.061
MATT: That's right, because
you are a grave cleric.

03:45:24.061 --> 03:45:25.843
TALIESIN: You are 17 points up.

03:45:25.844 --> 03:45:27.285
SAM: Oh.

03:45:27.285 --> 03:45:28.960
MATT: You're also on fire.

03:45:28.961 --> 03:45:30.831
SAM: Oh great.

03:45:30.831 --> 03:45:36.285
TRAVIS: 18d10? What is the matter
with you, Perkins? Didn't you know

03:45:36.285 --> 03:45:40.675
this moment was coming when you made those
rules?!

03:45:40.676 --> 03:45:41.813
MARISHA: Blame Perkins for everything.

03:45:41.816 --> 03:45:45.049
TRAVIS: I get that lava is dangerous, but fuck!

03:45:45.049 --> 03:45:48.425
LIAM: So what I did last time did not work
so I am going to change tactics

03:45:48.425 --> 03:45:53.173
and I am going to cast instead Polymorph
on the same giant--

03:45:53.173 --> 03:45:55.194
MATT: Okay, on the big one?

03:45:55.194 --> 03:45:56.667
LIAM: Yeah.

03:45:56.667 --> 03:45:58.428
MATT: What are you polymorphing them into?

03:45:58.428 --> 03:46:00.170
LIAM: A giant octopus.

03:46:00.170 --> 03:46:01.814
MATT: Okay. So that is a what?

03:46:01.814 --> 03:46:03.349
LIAM: 16 wisdom.

03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:11.807
MATT: 16 wisdom. That is a 15. The large
giant suddenly turns into a large octopus.

03:46:11.807 --> 03:46:13.842
LIAM: He has a movement of ten.

03:46:13.915 --> 03:46:18.220
MATT: I will say for the purposes of not
having a giant octopus thing,

03:46:18.220 --> 03:46:20.252
we will just use that for now.

03:46:20.252 --> 03:46:22.002
SAM: It's actually pretty close.

03:46:22.002 --> 03:46:27.227
MATT: It's aquatic in nature. It suddenly (wet
impacts) and is now trying to pull itself forward

03:46:27.304 --> 03:46:32.330
on its new cephalopod body.
So that's your action, Caleb.

03:46:32.496 --> 03:46:38.508
LIAM: I'm going to move back into the--
nope. I'm going to stay right there.

03:46:38.508 --> 03:46:41.199
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn.
Beau, you're up.

03:46:41.200 --> 03:46:49.407
MARISHA: I was holding my action to
go run and grab Nott.

03:46:49.407 --> 03:46:56.800
MATT: So as soon as that happened, you would be
(counting) 35. So you move up with your action.

03:46:56.800 --> 03:47:00.112
You haven't grabbed yet. That was
your holding your dash.

03:47:00.112 --> 03:47:02.514
MARISHA: I'm going to grab flaming Nott.

03:47:02.514 --> 03:47:05.700
MATT: So you reached down and the flames
are burning your hand. The heat is causing

03:47:05.700 --> 03:47:11.707
the skin on your face and arms to begin
to bubble from just the sheer intensity

03:47:11.707 --> 03:47:19.004
of it. As you reach down and pull Nott's
flaming body up from the lava, Nott, your

03:47:19.004 --> 03:47:22.578
eyes come open at that moment and you realize
you're on fire, but Beau is holding you.

03:47:22.578 --> 03:47:24.999
SAM: (screams)

03:47:24.999 --> 03:47:27.407
MARISHA: Through the flames. (screams)

03:47:27.408 --> 03:47:29.032
MATT: You're going to go ahead and--?

03:47:29.032 --> 03:47:31.120
MARISHA: Dash back. Step of the wind!

03:47:31.120 --> 03:47:34.234
MATT: Well, you still have a movement and
your bonus so it was just your action to

03:47:34.234 --> 03:47:40.474
pick up-- it's half-speed to drag somebody
with you so you move 20 feet (counting)

03:47:40.474 --> 03:47:47.469
and then you can move (counting)
15 to get Nott into the tunnel.

03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:49.857
MARISHA: And then I stop, drop,
and roll with Nott.

03:47:49.857 --> 03:47:55.148
MATT: Okay. That would be your next turn
because that was all your actions left.

03:47:55.149 --> 03:47:56.333
LIAM: That was a lot.

03:47:56.333 --> 03:47:59.257
TRAVIS: That was amazing. What are you talking
about? We're fine.

03:47:59.257 --> 03:48:05.705
MATT: Jester, your turn. You see Beau suddenly
rush in and drop to the ground and Nott is on fire.

03:48:05.914 --> 03:48:07.542
MARISHA: Are we both on fire or--

03:48:07.542 --> 03:48:12.140
MATT: Nott currently is the only one on fire
but you do take five points of fire damage

03:48:12.140 --> 03:48:15.715
just from the proximity of reaching out
and grabbing Nott's body.

03:48:15.715 --> 03:48:17.423
MARISHA: Sure.

03:48:17.423 --> 03:48:19.008
LAURA: Okay.

03:48:19.008 --> 03:48:22.289
LIAM: Caleb's standing like a doofus because he
didn't want to leave Nott so he's still out there.

03:48:22.290 --> 03:48:26.197
TRAVIS: Kill that fire giant with your duplicity.

03:48:26.197 --> 03:48:33.125
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to run up with my duplicate
and cast Inflict Wounds at 3rd-level.

03:48:33.125 --> 03:48:34.503
TRAVIS: Kick him in the shin.

03:48:34.503 --> 03:48:35.930
LAURA: Just kick him!

03:48:35.930 --> 03:48:37.537
LIAM: Just make him mad.

03:48:37.537 --> 03:48:39.414
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

03:48:39.414 --> 03:48:41.099
MARISHA: Come on! Yes!

03:48:41.099 --> 03:48:42.708
TALIESIN: This is not a bad idea.

03:48:42.708 --> 03:48:44.208
MARISHA: You are their god!

03:48:44.208 --> 03:48:46.116
LIAM: To keep it occupied: the octopus
is going nowhere.

03:48:46.116 --> 03:48:47.333
LAURA: 17 plus eight. 25!

03:48:47.333 --> 03:48:50.557
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:48:50.557 --> 03:49:04.823
LAURA: 5d10! Oh! 30?! (counting)
36 points.

03:49:04.823 --> 03:49:09.778
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage. As your
duplicate rushes forward and reaches out and

03:49:09.778 --> 03:49:15.640
grabs the knee right in front of the storming
fire giant. You watch as the surge of divine

03:49:15.641 --> 03:49:20.862
energy goes from a blue to a green to a black
and as it pierces the knee cap and shoots up

03:49:20.862 --> 03:49:27.968
the leg, the giant just howls in extreme pain and
while it was currently focused and reaching down

03:49:27.968 --> 03:49:32.376
for another boulder while watching Beau carry
Nott away, it suddenly drops the rock,

03:49:32.376 --> 03:49:36.857
grabs its hammer, and looks down
at your duplicate, furious.

03:49:36.857 --> 03:49:39.383
LIAM: Ooh, meniscus tear.

03:49:39.383 --> 03:49:44.594
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn, Jester?
Is that your turn?

03:49:44.595 --> 03:49:47.570
LAURA: That's-- yeah. I mean,
that's all I could do.

03:49:47.570 --> 03:49:49.537
MATT: All right, Fjord. Anything?

03:49:49.537 --> 03:49:51.940
LAURA: Or-- no, that was my action.

03:49:51.940 --> 03:49:55.220
TALIESIN: I mean, you could grab Caleb.
I don't know.

03:49:55.360 --> 03:49:59.579
TRAVIS: No, Caleb can walk his happy ass inside.
No, Fjord is doing nothing.

03:49:59.579 --> 03:50:01.558
MARISHA: Let's bounce.

03:50:01.708 --> 03:50:03.559
TRAVIS: Fjord's doing nothing.

03:50:03.559 --> 03:50:05.950
MATT: Nothing? All right. Caduceus?

03:50:05.973 --> 03:50:11.384
LAURA: Heal Nott or put the fire out or something.
You guys can put the fire out on Nott at least.

03:50:11.423 --> 03:50:13.161
SAM: (screams)

03:50:13.161 --> 03:50:15.263
TRAVIS: I thought you put it out? Oh yeah, I will
run over and pat the fire out.

03:50:15.264 --> 03:50:21.614
MATT: Okay, you use your action to put the
fire out on Nott.

03:50:21.614 --> 03:50:25.268
MATT: You're just watching. "You got this."

03:50:25.500 --> 03:50:28.431
TRAVIS: Yeah. You good?

03:50:28.431 --> 03:50:30.062
MARISHA: Looks fine to me.

03:50:30.062 --> 03:50:31.603
TALIESIN: I'm holding Stone Shape.

03:50:31.604 --> 03:50:34.546
MATT: You got it. That brings us to their turn.
This one is going to--

03:50:35.245 --> 03:50:36.892
LIAM: Ten feet of movement!

03:50:36.892 --> 03:50:40.372
MATT: No, just up there and then dashes.

03:50:40.373 --> 03:50:42.531
LIAM: What? Okay.

03:50:42.531 --> 03:50:47.661
MATT: It's still not in range but it's
curling over the ruins of the bridge.

03:50:47.661 --> 03:50:56.915
Your blink dog gets into your space there.
Now at the end of Polymorph,

03:50:56.916 --> 03:50:59.767
it doesn't get a saving throw, right?
I don't believe.

03:50:59.767 --> 03:51:02.820
LIAM: I don't think so. It's just that unless it
gets hit.

03:51:02.968 --> 03:51:08.201
MATT: Yeah, that's what I thought it was.
Okay. All righty.

03:51:08.201 --> 03:51:14.310
LIAM: Lasts for the duration or until
the target drops to zero hit points--

03:51:14.310 --> 03:51:20.028
MATT: Right, it's just concentration. That's
right. Cool. The other fire giant is going to--

03:51:20.028 --> 03:51:26.152
it does not discern that this is an illusion and
just spends its turn with two giant hammer

03:51:26.152 --> 03:51:31.764
swings towards your illusory Jester just through
it with no effect. Angrily swings again.

03:51:31.765 --> 03:51:36.756
No effect. Definitely knows it's an illusion now
but wasted its entire turn doing that. That

03:51:36.756 --> 03:51:45.217
being the case, it's going to go ahead and move.
(counting) 20. The thing sinks into the lava

03:51:45.217 --> 03:51:51.644
and its feet (sizzling sounds) into it. Doesn't
matter. It is now starting to step out of the

03:51:51.644 --> 03:51:56.447
lava. Has one leg up and its hammer ready,
and it's just steaming towards like you

03:51:56.447 --> 03:52:01.701
like an angry freight train. That ends their
turn. Moving forward, Yasha's up. Anything?

03:52:01.701 --> 03:52:05.233
TRAVIS: Yasha will put her hand on Fjord
and hit healing hands, giving him

03:52:05.233 --> 03:52:09.772
seven hit points and yell to Caleb: Caleb!

03:52:09.772 --> 03:52:12.523
MATT: All right, Nott's turn.

03:52:12.523 --> 03:52:15.128
SAM: (screams) Am I on fire?

03:52:15.128 --> 03:52:18.359
MATT: No. Fjord has put the fire out.

03:52:18.359 --> 03:52:23.568
SAM: Then I will stick my head out through
the door and shoot a crossbow bolt

03:52:23.568 --> 03:52:30.210
at that giant that is stalking my friend
Caleb. Not great. 16.

03:52:30.210 --> 03:52:34.191
MATT: 16 misses or it hits but it hits the plate
armor in its chest and just ricochets off.

03:52:34.191 --> 03:52:38.735
SAM: I shoot him again. Bonus action.
Not great. 17.

03:52:38.735 --> 03:52:41.931
MATT: 17. Actually, it hits the armor and
gets stuck but it didn't pierce enough

03:52:41.931 --> 03:52:43.717
to actually hurt the giant.

03:52:43.717 --> 03:52:45.152
SAM: Okay. That's it.

03:52:45.152 --> 03:52:46.957
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. Caleb,
your turn.

03:52:46.957 --> 03:52:52.068
LIAM: For an action, I will disengage and
juke left-right and run into the hole.

03:52:52.068 --> 03:53:00.495
TALIESIN: The second Caleb is through the hole,
the stone is sealing. The entire door is gone.

03:53:00.495 --> 03:53:02.106
It's just rock again.

03:53:02.106 --> 03:53:04.125
MATT: The entire door wall closes off
with five feet of stone.

03:53:04.125 --> 03:53:07.390
TRAVIS: Five feet is not enough.
We must keep running.

03:53:07.391 --> 03:53:11.065
MATT: As soon as that happens, you're like,
"Awesome. All right, let's go!" and you hear

03:53:11.065 --> 03:53:15.220
(pounding) from the back. The stone is already
(cracking).

03:53:15.220 --> 03:53:17.080
TRAVIS: Must go faster.

03:53:17.170 --> 03:53:21.148
MATT: All right. You guys go running and running.
You hear the impacts from behind get more and more

03:53:21.149 --> 03:53:30.520
distant as you feel like you've managed to safely
make your way beyond this strange encounter from

03:53:30.520 --> 03:53:37.220
the outskirts of this unknown fire giant citadel.
And that's when we'll finish tonight's episode.

03:53:37.405 --> 03:53:40.759
(cheering)

03:53:40.759 --> 03:53:43.006
LIAM: Chris! Join us at the table.

03:53:43.007 --> 03:53:44.702
TALIESIN: Dude! Come here.

03:53:44.702 --> 03:53:46.315
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

03:53:46.315 --> 03:53:49.546
LAURA: Oh my goodness gracious.

03:53:49.546 --> 03:53:56.260
CHRIS: Somebody wrote a poem for me:
Here lay the chunks / Of a kobold named Spurt /

03:53:56.260 --> 03:54:05.065
He beat his skunks / So they wouldn't squirt. /
He feared no foes / And snacked on scat /

03:54:05.065 --> 03:54:09.349
But against a giant's blows / He soon went splat.

03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:11.751
(cheering)

03:54:11.751 --> 03:54:12.729
MATT: Who sent that?

03:54:12.730 --> 03:54:15.414
CHRIS: That was Dusty Patron of Hugs, @geonerd.

03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:17.081
LAURA: That was lovely.

03:54:17.081 --> 03:54:20.508
MATT: Well done. Well, thank you guys.
Thank you so much Chris for jumping in.

03:54:20.508 --> 03:54:22.122
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yay!

03:54:22.123 --> 03:54:24.451
TALIESIN: That was such a surprise.

03:54:24.451 --> 03:54:32.101
TRAVIS: Fuck you and your magma damage.
18d8. Oh my god.

03:54:32.101 --> 03:54:40.340
MATT: Just to remind everyone: we are taking a
week off from Critical Role next Thursday and

03:54:40.340 --> 03:54:47.276
Talks will be off on that Tuesday the 12th
so we'll be back the 14th at 7pm here.

03:54:47.276 --> 03:54:53.779
LAURA: Also, poster and prints in the store now.
Art prints. I'm still talking like Jester

03:54:53.779 --> 03:54:56.660
and we still have our awesome shirt.

03:54:56.660 --> 03:54:58.760
SAM: But Talks is going to be on this Tuesday?

03:54:58.760 --> 03:55:05.924
MATT: Yes, this Tuesday but not the Tuesday after.
But yeah, we'll see you soon enough. Until then,

03:55:05.924 --> 03:55:10.112
we love you guys, have a wonderful week,
and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

03:55:10.112 --> 03:55:11.961
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:55:11.961 --> 03:55:22.107

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.258
MATT: Hello, and welcome to Critical Role,

00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:05.540
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.748
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:09.540
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:11.266
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.866
MATT: Missed you guys so much.
ASHLEY: Oh man!

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.310
SAM: Oh man.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.560
MATT: Missed <i>you</i> guys so much.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.890
Thank you, all, so much for your patience,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.480
as we all adjusted to this pandemic.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.150
We kept ourselves and our crew safe and healthy

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.840
and worked on a process of getting us

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.180
to this optimal setup, which was brainstormed

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.800
and developed by our fantastic production team.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.290
Thank you so much to our production team

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.928
and Marisha.
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes!

00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:41.520
Yeah, snap.
MATT: The content team's working

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.860
so hard throughout this time to get us back here

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.030
in a very safe manner.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.590
And thank you for your patience, guys, sincerely.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.497
This is really exciting.

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:54.100
It's not until-- and I'm sure some of you can speak

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.270
to this, too-- it's not until this is taken from you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.390
that you realize how important of a rock it is

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.810
in your weekly life, let alone daily life and--

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.029
LIAM: Straight up.

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:04.241
MATT: (sighs) I'm so happy to
be back here with you guys.

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.060
LIAM: Yeah.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.744
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: How do we do this?

00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:08.884
(laughter)

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:10.560
LAURA: I'm so nervous.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.760
MATT: That's the crazy thing about D&amp;D.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.112
You just kind of improvise.

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:14.945
LAURA: Just make it up.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:17.090
MATT: Just figure it out, you'll be fine.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.450
Quick housekeeping note,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690
we will not be hosting a giveaway at the break,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.060
as we have previously.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.520
For the time being, at least, we won't be doing that.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.550
And we'll let you know whenever that changes.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.220
But big thanks to our friends at Wyrmwood

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.000
for helping us make our break times for the show so epic,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.140
for as long as they have been around.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.270
We really appreciate it. You guys are awesome.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.940
Let's see, we have some announcements.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.773
We'll begin--

00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:41.010
Sam, you had something you wanted

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.184
to mention.
SAM: Yes, there's no--

00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:44.440
(clears throat) There's no sponsor for tonight,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.700
but if I don't speak for a
minute at the top of the show,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.234
I have no purpose in life.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.710
(laughter)

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.633
So rather than wither into a husk, I wrote a poem.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.070
(clears throat)
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.960
SAM: This isn't an ad.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.210
There's no sponsor today,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850
just some friends and some dice,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.780
here to laugh and to play.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.050
It's scary outside, filled with hard news and strife.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.830
But in here, Fjord sails us through a fantasy life,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.150
where we battle for gold and drink from a flagon,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.800
unless we get snapped up by a turtle or dragon.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.060
We know that reality's been quite pernicious,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.090
but you made it this far, and we're so glad you're with us.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.420
Us in our studio, you safe at home,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.630
and though we sit by ourselves, we don't feel alone.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.540
We're surrounded by love, of all colors and races,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.370
by Pride, by Black Lives, by Critters in all places.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.250
So thank you.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.490
Thanks to the techies, the staff, and the crew,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.230
but most importantly, thank you to you.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.720
While we were gone, you patiently wait.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.810
You guys are our antidote.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.240
You let us create.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.300
And so I raise a glass,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.290
and though we can't clink 'em,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.532
we can still toast, and we can still drink 'em.

00:02:53.532 --> 00:02:55.611
(laughter)

00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.650
We love all you Critters, and I'm happy to say,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.468
tonight, you're going to watch a really great TPK.

00:03:01.468 --> 00:03:05.326
(laughter)

00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:06.656
It's been a while--

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:08.480
ALL: ♪ It's been a while ♪

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.980
SAM: But in case you forget, you can always ask,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.280
is it Thursday yet?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.650
Cheers!
ALL: Oh!

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.735
TRAVIS: Love you, man.
LAURA: Cheers!

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:16.249
MATT: Love you, buddy.

00:03:17.242 --> 00:03:19.370
TRAVIS: You made the wizard cry before the game started.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.203
MARISHA: I know.

00:03:20.203 --> 00:03:21.970
I'm all watery now.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.387
ASHLEY: Yeah, that got me.
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:23.387 --> 00:03:24.950
ASHLEY: Jeesh!
TALIESIN: Goddamn.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.783
LAURA: Oh man.
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:25.783 --> 00:03:27.636
That was really sweet.
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:29.056
TALIESIN: It should've rhymed, though.
MATT: A broken clock.

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:30.390
(laughter)

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.210
ASHLEY: And finding a rhyme with "pernicious," no less.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.110
MATT: Yeah!

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.509
SAM: Come on, who are you talking to?

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.571
(laughter)

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:39.812
TALIESIN: I'll admit that rhyme, it made me suspicious.

00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:42.340
SAM: Oh!
ASHLEY: Ay!

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.761
TALIESIN: Still, no.
MATT: No (laughs).

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:45.600
Thank you, Sam.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.620
Marisha, you had some things you wanted to talk about.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.700
MARISHA: Yes, so in case you missed it,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.150
we released a brand new State of the Role

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.910
that explains a lot about the process

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.370
of bringing the show back

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.420
and the safety measures that went into this

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.050
and what you can expect from the channel

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.830
in the near future, so be sure to check it out.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.045
It kind of explains a lot more of what you see here.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.080
It'll be on our YouTube channel.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.940
And yeah, with that, this is prerecorded.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.580
So when you see this, it'll be the future.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.380
But now, it's the past.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.530
So just know that.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.870
You should probably know that.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.870
We're pre-taping this, for safety.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.293
LIAM: (as Caleb) How did you
accomplish this great feat?

00:04:27.293 --> 00:04:28.727
(laughter)

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:32.904
MARISHA: The magic of scrying stones
has gotten (clicks) top notch.

00:04:32.904 --> 00:04:33.910
SAM: It's the future.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.200
That means that things are better and better, right?

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.733
That's how things have been going.

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:39.783
MARISHA: Yes.

00:04:39.783 --> 00:04:41.420
SAM: Great.
MATT: They will be eventually.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.454
MARISHA: We'll see, right?
TRAVIS: 2020 might have something

00:04:42.454 --> 00:04:43.632
to say about that (laughs).

00:04:43.632 --> 00:04:45.343
MARISHA: The chat will let us know.

00:04:45.343 --> 00:04:48.385
(laughter)

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.390
With that, join us, next Tuesday, on July 7th,

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.320
at 4:00pm Pacific, for our latest episode

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.250
of Narrative Tal-- uh, Narrative Taliesin,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.727
featuring Telephone.

00:04:58.727 --> 00:05:01.853
(laughter)

00:05:01.853 --> 00:05:03.680
I don't know how words work anymore.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.013
I've been locked in a room.

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:07.420
Yeah, you're doing a thing.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.640
You're doing your Narrative Telephone, and it's next.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.500
TALIESIN: It's also in the future and in the past.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.333
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: That's true.

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:14.850
TRAVIS: Just like you.
LAURA: Whoa.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.360
MARISHA: And that's it, that's it.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.550
I'm glad to be back.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.565
Holy shit.

00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:20.660
(laughter)

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.352
MATT: Thank you, Marisha.

00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:23.751
And speaking of Narrative Taliesin,

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:25.910
Taliesin, Liam, you guys wanted to talk a little bit.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.490
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, I'll start this off.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.220
While we were on our imposed hiatus,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.130
we apparently released a third art book,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.470
in our series of art books, The Chronicles of Exandria.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.790
This one is kind of special, because the writing team,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.400
which was myself, Dani Carr, and whoever I could wrangle

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.030
from the cast, and also Marisha's notes,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.850
which were very helpful, put together this book

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.560
as The Mighty Nein, from Beau's point of view.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.240
It's got a lot of interesting narrative stuff,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.320
and I'm really excited for you all

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.056
to see what we put together.

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:57.889
ASHLEY: Cool.

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:58.722
TALIESIN: Oh, well.

00:05:58.722 --> 00:06:00.410
LIAM: This beautiful beast,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.180
the deluxe version is currently sold out in our shops,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.150
but we're going to try to get it restocked in the store,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.920
sometime later in the summer, but for now,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.390
the standard edition, you can find it, right now,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.550
through your favorite local bookstores

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.520
and online through Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.950
And since we're back, since we're in the past

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.280
and in the future, and talking to you guys again,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.300
I just want to take a moment--

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.030
this is not the standard, it is still the deluxe--

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.970
but just to thank every artist who contributed to this.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.800
It was a work of love, from top to bottom,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.500
that wouldn't exist without you.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.360
I'm going to just gush and show a couple of like, uh--

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.060
SAM: Sneakie-peakies?
LIAM: Some beautiful stuffs here.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.360
Here, we have a spread with art

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.530
by Jonah Baumann, @GalacticJonah,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.870
as well as Meghan Pagliaroni, who I know better

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.040
as @SmallTownInk, because I know people's handle first,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.690
because it's 2020.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.559
That's a beautiful spread.
MATT: Yeah!

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:51.400
TALIESIN: Oh!
MARISHA: Look at that.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.010
LIAM: That one.
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh, man.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.140
MATT: It's so purty.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.360
LIAM: I also flagged this one, with this great Yasha.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.411
TALIESIN: Oh!
ASHLEY: Hey!

00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:05.020
LIAM: Which is done by Azra or Azra, @Azraillu,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.815
I don't know how to pronounce that.

00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:09.690
MATT: (laughs) That's beautiful.
LIAM: And then, one more I'm going to show,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.223
this one was done by Will Kirkby,

00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:13.310
and it was one that no one has seen before.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.250
It only exists in this book, and it's gorgeous.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.083
SAM: Oh, really?

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.540
LIAM: Everyone looks sad, because something bad happened

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.940
just moments before this.
SAM: Spoilers, spoilers.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.950
Oh wow.
LIAM: But just so layered

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.980
and complicated, and the color is amazing.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.920
Will, you've outdone yourself again

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.110
and again and again, and it's full,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.700
I'm just not going to give away the whole story.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.390
It's just everything, top to bottom,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.990
every page is gorgeous.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.500
Thank you, artists, always.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.333
That's it for me.

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:41.176
MATT: Awesome, thank you.

00:07:41.176 --> 00:07:42.519
(cheering)

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.352
SAM: Good job, guys.

00:07:43.352 --> 00:07:44.400
MATT: We've got a few more things to talk about.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.415
It's been a while.

00:07:45.415 --> 00:07:46.920
ALL: ♪ It's been a while ♪

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.900
MATT: So we've got a little bit
of catching up to do here.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.620
But, Laura, you're up next.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.230
LAURA: I'm up!

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.340
Okay, so, you guys-- (laughs)

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.320
so we've been working on this thing for a while,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.500
and we've been holding onto it,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.710
because this is for the 100th episode.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.150
And now we can finally show it to you.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.805
It is a spell scroll.

00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:09.100
SAM: A spell scroll?

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.399
LAURA: Well, I mean, sort of.

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:14.910
So, it's in conjunction with our pals at Die Hard Dice.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.074
They helped us make--

00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:17.450
MATT: ♪ Die Hard Dice ♪

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.133
LAURA: This amazing scroll, which
is based on...

00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:23.809
Fortune's Favor.

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:25.132
SAM: Ooh!

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.080
LAURA: So yeah, these are sketches done by Taliesin,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.560
with input from Matt.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.710
There's little Easter eggs on the page,

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.870
so you can check it out.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.850
And then it's to roll your dice on,

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.488
because everything has to do with dice, here.

00:08:38.488 --> 00:08:39.830
And then, in here,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.420
it's also got this fabulous little pocket,

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.330
so you can put, like, your figures

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.167
or some dice and stuff, you know.

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:48.763
Pretty great, and over here

00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:50.390
you've got a whole other pouch.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.798
You guys, it's the coolest! Anyway.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.523
(laughter)

00:08:54.523 --> 00:08:56.420
Seriously, check it out.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.950
It's in the store... a-now.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:07.675
This is our commemorative item.
TRAVIS: "A-now!"

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.160
LAURA: And then, also,
I'm not going to talk about everything,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.000
but we also released a bunch of items

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.150
while we've been on hiatus,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.220
so go to the store, check them out,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.940
some of it's really fricking cute.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.430
I just sent you guys a picture of one of them.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.310
SAM: Holy--
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.810
SAM: That's available now?

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.750
LAURA: Yes!
TALIESIN: That was a lot.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.110
LAURA: Go to the store!
SAM: Oh boy.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.380
MATT: Awesome.
SAM: Oh boy, oh.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.820
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.190
That spell scroll, because Taliesin is an insane person,

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.328
not only does it have a bunch of Easter eggs in it.

00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:28.076
TRAVIS: It does?

00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:29.140
MATT: It's functional,

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.250
in as much a spell scroll can be functional in its design.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.440
LAURA: I should say this was also helped designed

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.248
by Aaron Monroy, who works at the company.

00:09:36.248 --> 00:09:37.256
MATT: Oh, yeah.

00:09:37.256 --> 00:09:38.447
LAURA: He's phenomenal.

00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:39.680
He does such amazing work, so yeah.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.710
ASHLEY: Oh, this is so cool.
MATT: But, anyway.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.683
We'll talk about that another time.
TALIESIN: I'll talk about that, another time.

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:46.110
That's a Talks Machina thing.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.073
MATT: All right, and, Ashley, I believe you're up last.

00:09:49.073 --> 00:09:51.442
ASHLEY: Yes, hey, guys, hello.
SAM: Ashley, it's your

00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:53.750
standard announcement.
ASHLEY: My standard announcement.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.800
Listen, we wanted to remind everyone

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.530
to continue supporting organizations working

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.500
towards ending systemic racism and promoting equality

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.960
in our communities.
(fists thumping)

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.830
MARISHA: Yes!
(fingers snapping)

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.430
ASHLEY: We stand with the Black Lives Matter movement,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.030
and we wanted to share some of our favorite organizations

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.060
who are all working towards ending complex

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.920
and unjust systems in our communities.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.450
Color of Change, which you can check out

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.620
at colorofchange.org.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.160
Race Forward, which you can check out at raceforward.org.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.600
And the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.600
which you can check out at A-- nope.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.998
(laughter)
naacpldf.org.

00:10:39.998 --> 00:10:43.560
So if you are able to, please consider a donation

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.000
to one of these three amazing organizations

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.970
or any one of your choosing.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.480
Don't forget to love each other.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.790
SAM: Yay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.370
MATT: Thank you, Ashley, and thank you, guys.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.070
So happy to be back.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.000
And since I believe that concludes our announcements--

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.543
SAM: No, no!

00:10:59.543 --> 00:11:00.380
TRAVIS: Can we talk about something else?

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.855
MATT: I believe it's time to
jump into tonight's episode of--

00:11:03.855 --> 00:11:05.188
(squealing and nervous noises)

00:11:05.188 --> 00:11:07.400
MARISHA: Did you guys watch Tiger King?

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400
MATT: Critical Role!

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.793
(yelling)

00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:49.940
MATT: And welcome back.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.648
SAM: What? Oh!

00:12:51.648 --> 00:12:52.883
TRAVIS: Oh god.

00:12:52.883 --> 00:12:55.130
LAURA: We didn't even say any weird things.
SAM: Kill the feed!

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.805
MATT: No, you did not.
LAURA: Oh god!

00:12:56.805 --> 00:12:59.152
MATT: Not my problem.

00:12:59.152 --> 00:13:01.608
Last we left off, The Mighty Nein,

00:13:01.608 --> 00:13:04.265
who had long been trying to bring some semblance

00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:06.210
of peace between the two warring nations

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.070
of the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire, had

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.830
finally, allied with some unique allies,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.450
made for some strange bedfellows,

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.300
as you accompanied armadas to meet

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.360
in the southern reaches of the Lucidian Ocean,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.242
south of Wildemount.

00:13:24.242 --> 00:13:28.667
There, you helped watch

00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:31.125
the proceeding completion

00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:33.710
and success of these peace negotiations.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.610
Prisoners of war were traded.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.251
The last, as far as they're aware, beacon

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:42.220
was given back to the Kryn Dynasty,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.960
and you all decided to make your way towards Rumblecusp,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.160
in preparation for the coming date

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.117
of Traveler Con, over a week from now.

00:13:52.543 --> 00:13:53.830
You had all--

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.140
over a week from the moment we start this session,

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.960
at the time, about two weeks out.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.170
You had began traveling southwest,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.760
beneath the island of Urukayxl,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.280
where you once fought your way into an ancient temple

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.231
and unlocked one of the various seals of Uk'otoa.

00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:11.428
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:14.060
MATT: You went around the Inkclaw Reef,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.340
continuing towards this island of Rumblecusp.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.630
And it was on this fourth day of your journey

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.850
that Caduceus began to notice something off the stern.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.490
It appeared to be a landmass of some kind.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.325
TRAVIS: It took you four days.
MATT: But after--

00:14:26.325 --> 00:14:27.800
Well, on the fourth day, it was noticed.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.600
It doesn't mean it was there for four days, but--

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.320
You noticed it seemed to be keeping pace.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.770
No, in fact, it seemed to be gaining--

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.795
SAM: Oh boy.
MATT: -- on your ship.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:43.490
As word got around, you all begin to realize

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.270
that this wasn't an island or a landmass at all.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.040
Instead, this was a massive creature, beneath the waves,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.270
a domed-shell, covered in spikes--

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.790
SAM: Oh boy.
MATT: -- and armored scales.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:00.790
You saw massive, fin-like limbs
pushing through beneath the water,

00:15:01.636 --> 00:15:05.278
as its snout pointed, angry,

00:15:05.278 --> 00:15:06.580
emerged from the water.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.550
This gargantuan

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.920
dragon turtle was rocketing through the waters,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.570
in the direction of your ship.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.610
And, my friends--

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.443
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:15:16.443 --> 00:15:17.810
MATT: -- that is where we are picking up.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.980
So, as you are all gathering now, looking off of the stern

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.180
of the ship, you notice this massive entity is careening

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.860
towards you and, I'd say, at this point,

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.290
it's about 200 or so feet out,

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.880
and it is rapidly gaining.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.020
MARISHA: Two, two, 200 feet?

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.198
LAURA: 200 feet?
MARISHA: Feet?

00:15:36.198 --> 00:15:38.860
TRAVIS: So a quick status check.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.940
Do we see any land anywhere, any horizon?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.530
MATT: From where you currently are, no.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.930
You can make off, in the distance from where you had been,

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.630
elements of, well, you wouldn't be able

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.660
to see it so much, from this distance,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.410
but you know you're far past the Inkclaw Reef,

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.790
and that's the closest landmass

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.130
that you've been near, and Urukayxl itself.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.040
TRAVIS: And can we currently tell if we are sailing

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.650
with the wind, against the wind?

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.450
MATT: You're sailing perpendicular to the wind.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.090
So it is not helping you or harming you.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:07.940
TRAVIS: Cool, cool.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.793
Shit, shit.

00:16:09.793 --> 00:16:11.300
SAM: (giggles)
TRAVIS: Right.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.410
LIAM: Captain, do you have any experience

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.900
with this sort of thing?

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.010
TRAVIS: That is a fucking great question.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.963
Has Fjord got any experience with dragon turtles?

00:16:20.963 --> 00:16:22.110
(laughter)

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.690
MATT: No! Up to this point,

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.630
dragon turtles were just a spooky ghost story

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.900
that drunken sailors would tell in taverns,

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.210
or they would tell sailors that were new

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.470
to the shipping industry, just to spook them.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.700
LAURA: Would Jester have heard any of these ghost stories?

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.880
MATT: Make a history check.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.280
TRAVIS: Fucking roll, first roll back.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.110
MARISHA: Come on.
SAM: This is it, Laura.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.450
MARISHA: Come on.
LAURA: If I roll poorly,

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.611
we're all going to die, tonight.
SAM: Yep.

00:16:47.611 --> 00:16:48.860
MARISHA: No.
LIAM: It's on you.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.693
LAURA: Oh no, it's-- oh.

00:16:49.693 --> 00:16:51.591
(laughter)

00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:53.040
This is history?

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.880
I mean, I have shit history, but I rolled an 11,

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.955
so it's 12.

00:16:57.955 --> 00:16:59.090
MATT: 12?

00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.923
No.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.870
But you've heard this.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.340
And you may have heard, in passing, of their existence.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.030
But in the same context,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.650
they're just known to destroy ships

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.190
and carry their contents down beneath the waves,

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.510
supposedly probably dragging what remnants within,

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.490
onward to where they call their home.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.510
MARISHA: So they're giant pirates.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.770
They're big pirate turtles,

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.145
pirate dragon turtles.

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:25.978
MATT: Yeah.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.800
LAURA: Did you cast Water Breathing this morning?

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.790
TRAVIS: Yeah, 2:30, every day, while we're on the water.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.190
LAURA: Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.290
ASHLEY: So we can all breathe underwater.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.380
TALIESIN: I can take this moment-- what?

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.410
ASHLEY: We can breathe underwater.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.243
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:17:37.243 --> 00:17:38.076
MARISHA: I feel like we should use that in, like,

00:17:38.076 --> 00:17:39.190
an emergency situation.
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a moment

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.350
to just cast Water Walk on everybody,

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.440
except Nott and plus Orly

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.460
and three other crew members, whoever's around.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.293
TRAVIS: What do you mean "Water Walk"?

00:17:46.293 --> 00:17:47.790
Like, we literally walk on the water?

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.530
TALIESIN: Yeah, you'll hit it like ground.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.550
MARISHA: What if you want to swim?

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.800
Can you choose to swim if you water walk?

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.490
SAM: Why would you want to swim?

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.323
MARISHA: Well, you know--

00:17:56.323 --> 00:17:58.027
SAM: It's gross.
MARISHA: It's great exercise.

00:17:58.027 --> 00:18:00.320
TRAVIS: Like, our speed on the water is the same

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.060
as if we were on solid ground?

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.040
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Correct,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.500
for the next hour.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.360
LIAM: Look at that creature approach.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.220
TALIESIN: No drowning.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.165
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, I'm going to--

00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:11.612
I'm going to use Divine Intervention.

00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:12.810
SAM: Oh!

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.850
MATT: You're going to use Divine Intervention?

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.600
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.480
LAURA: How do I do it?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.620
MATT: You roll 2d10. Or a percentile dice.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.760
A d10 and a percentile dice.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.920
And you are trying to roll a 12 or under.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.070
LIAM: We need the Traveler drop kicking

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.390
out of the ocean.
LAURA: Which one is the first?

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.290
Oh, okay, the percentile is the first number?

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.910
MATT: It's the first number, the first digit, yes.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.020
TRAVIS: The old Atomic Elbow.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.140
LIAM: Come on, Traveler.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.140
I believe in you.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.140
LAURA: Oh yeah, no.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.550
(laughter)

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.907
LAURA: I rolled a 95.

00:18:40.907 --> 00:18:42.125
(laughter)

00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:44.260
TRAVIS: The opposite.
LAURA: He's definitely not coming.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.130
MATT: As you clutch onto your holy symbol,

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.180
looking off to the horizon, desperately wishing

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.690
for the Traveler's attention, a voice just goes,

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.523
"I'm terribly sorry.

00:18:51.523 --> 00:18:52.569
"I'm really busy."

00:18:52.569 --> 00:18:53.960
LAURA: (groans)

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.760
MATT: "But soon, sorry!"

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.190
TRAVIS: I'm afraid nothing good can come of this.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.450
We might as well try and buy ourselves some time.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.670
We should set full speed ahead

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.260
and try and go as fast as possible

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.720
to give ourselves time to prepare

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.010
for this, any way we can, so--

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.430
MARISHA: Is that the direct order, Captain?

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.322
TRAVIS: Yes, actually--
MARISHA: (hollering) Full speed ahead!

00:19:13.322 --> 00:19:14.700
LIAM: Ooh!
MATT: Okay.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.930
TRAVIS: First Mate, you'll stay with me.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.570
The rest of the crew will engage.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:21.950
So the other four, Orly, Marius, Gallan, and Delles,

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.570
will all join you, but we're going

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.820
to be going as quickly as possible.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.860
The Boatswain will help exhort a crew

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.530
to work harder and drive a ship forward.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.120
So I'll roll a d6 and multiply the result by five,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.770
and we'll apply that bonus to the ship speed,

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:39.680
which is a flat, because we're not with or against the wind,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.230
35 feet per turn.
MATT: Okay.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.931
ASHLEY: Hello, sir!
LAURA: I know!

00:19:44.931 --> 00:19:46.560
Go Captain Tusktooth.
MARISHA: Before he does that--

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.130
Er, sorry, go ahead and do your thing.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.740
I was going to bust out the fan,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.800
the wind Mortal Kombat fan, and give us a nice

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.930
burst of wind--
MATT: A burst of speed?

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.448
MARISHA: As we go.
MATT: Okay, cool.

00:19:57.448 --> 00:19:58.997
All right, so as you,

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.750
(whooshes) and create that one column

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.930
of wind blasting into the back of the sail,

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.970
it manages to give it a little bit of a push,

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.010
a magical nudge, if you will.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.340
TRAVIS: That went as well as it could.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.360
It was a six times five, which is 30,

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.870
so 65 feet is our speed.
MATT: Okay, so with that,

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:17.956
as you all push the sails,

00:20:17.956 --> 00:20:19.120
(whooshes) unfurling, trying

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.703
to catch as much of the wind as possible, at an angle,

00:20:21.703 --> 00:20:23.807
you feel the ship lurch a little bit more

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.400
in the direction you're trying to go.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.890
It cuts a little bit of an angle

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.460
towards the straight direction it was traveling,

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.530
because it's just the nature of the wind itself coming

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.230
at the odd angle it is.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.480
But between that and with Beau's helping,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.980
it does gain a little bit of speed. Caduceus?

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.088
TALIESIN: I have a question. How big is this turtle?

00:20:40.088 --> 00:20:41.480
MATT: From what you can see,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.720
because you can't see the full shape of it.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.620
You only see maybe about 20% of it,

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.660
that's breaking the surface,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.520
and you could see the the shape of the shadow of it,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.740
before it all just vanishes beneath the waves,

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.470
and you can see, occasionally, the giant clawed flippers,

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.740
underneath the water, (gurgles),

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.532
and the wake being left behind it.

00:20:59.532 --> 00:21:03.936
But you're guessing it's somewhere
in the neighborhood of about

00:21:03.936 --> 00:21:06.761
40-ish feet, from side to side.

00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:07.973
SAM: Whoa.

00:21:07.973 --> 00:21:09.090
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.150
LAURA: How big is our ship from side to side?

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.680
TRAVIS: We are 90 feet by 25 feet.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.513
MATT: Yep.

00:21:15.513 --> 00:21:16.810
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay.
MATT: Yeah, it is wider

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:17.643
than your ship.

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:20.150
LAURA: And as long as half of our ship.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.760
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Wow.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.518
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:21:23.518 --> 00:21:26.168
I'm going to take this opportunity to just sort of,

00:21:26.168 --> 00:21:28.857
eh, let's cast Whirlpool right on that bugger.

00:21:28.857 --> 00:21:29.850
SAM: Whoa!

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:30.870
MATT: Okay!

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.703
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:21:31.703 --> 00:21:32.765
MATT: What's the range on Whirlpool?

00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:33.673
SAM: We're attacking.

00:21:33.673 --> 00:21:35.000
TALIESIN: It's not an attack.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.765
MATT: No, I know, what's the range on it, though?

00:21:36.765 --> 00:21:37.598
LIAM: It's a swirly.

00:21:37.598 --> 00:21:40.060
TALIESIN: It's 300 feet.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.320
MATT: Okay, yeah, you can definitely catch it.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.010
TRAVIS: It's a "what you make of it."

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.360
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah (laughs).

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.445
SAM: Wee!
MARISHA: Water parks are fun.

00:21:46.445 --> 00:21:48.130
LIAM: (warbles)

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.460
TALIESIN: It's going to slow him down.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.520
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.320
MATT: Now, Whirlpool, what level spell is that?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.240
TALIESIN: Fourth.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.420
MATT: 4th-level, okay.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.420
Now what does it do?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.233
TALIESIN: Let's see.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.210
It's 50 feet square.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.500
And the vortex is five feet wide.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.100
And any creature or object in the water within 25 feet

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.152
of the vortex, which is, so it's 70 feet,

00:22:12.152 --> 00:22:13.810
is pulled 10 feet towards it.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.360
So it pulls him 10 feet back.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.070
And the only way you can swim away is

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.490
by making a strength check

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.630
against my spell DC.
MATT: Spell DC.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.770
ASHLEY: And he dies instantly.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.585
LIAM: (like Stefon from SNL) The Lucidian Ocean's
greatest attraction is the Vortex.

00:22:26.585 --> 00:22:29.826
(laughter)

00:22:29.826 --> 00:22:31.374
MARISHA: Tuesdays is Turtles Night.
SAM: (like Stefon) It's got everything.

00:22:31.374 --> 00:22:33.830
LIAM: This place has everything.
(laughter)

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.430
MATT: So to that point, as you guys all begin to scatter

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.940
to your places on the ship, after you get your orders

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.470
from Captain, over here,

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.261
you go ahead and summon this

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:45.540
swirling whirlpool right in front

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.560
of this dragon turtle's current trajectory.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.520
As it does, the water (hisses) careens around it,

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.330
and you watch it push in,

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.640
and it gets pulled back a bit.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.080
Between the benefits you guys are doing,

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.260
you actually prevent it from gaining on you, this round.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.090
TALIESIN: It also has to make a strength saving throw.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.256
MATT: Well, that's a--

00:23:04.256 --> 00:23:05.939
I'm not joking, a natural 20.

00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:07.040
TALIESIN: That's fine.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040
That's just to not take bludgeoning damage.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.560
MATT: Yeah, so it doesn't take any bludgeoning damage,

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.810
and is it's a strength check to try and escape from it?

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:14.940
TALIESIN: It isn't caught,

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.110
but it's still in it.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.920
MATT: Okay, 26 is what it rolls,

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.200
so I'm pretty sure it breaks out of the whirlpool.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.170
TRAVIS: 26 strength check.
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.830
TALIESIN: It's not out of it, depending on its speed,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.370
it's not out of it yet, because it has to be--

00:23:28.325 --> 00:23:29.910
MATT: It got pulled 10 feet towards it,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.500
and at its speed, going full speed towards you,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.553
it does manage to make its way out.
TALIESIN: Okay, never mind.

00:23:34.553 --> 00:23:35.730
MATT: It's moving pretty quickly.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.000
Just eyeballing it, it's traveling about 80 feet a round.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.420
TALIESIN: Okay, because that's 75 feet, to get away from it.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.040
Or, actually, no, if it was on the other side of it,

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.390
that's more than 75 feet.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.970
So it's 100 feet, technically.
MATT: Right.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.010
TRAVIS: We're about five feet per turn faster than it--

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:48.990
MATT: We'll say it's still on the cusp of it.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.160
TALIESIN: All right, that's fine.
MATT: It's still in there.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.030
Next round, I'll make

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.130
another check for it.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.600
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: I know it ain't going to work.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.170
MATT: Nevertheless, now, we go into the initiative order

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.580
between the ship and the dragon turtle.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.320
So I would like you to roll initiative for the ship,

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.710
if you don't mind.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.520
TRAVIS: Yeah, not a problem, not a problem, not a problem.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.480
MATT: So it's the dexterity modifier of the ship plus your--

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.295
TRAVIS: Which is four.
MATT: Ship's crew quality bonus, which is five.

00:24:10.295 --> 00:24:12.160
TRAVIS: So, nine.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.680
LAURA: Plus...

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.180
TRAVIS: 13, so 22.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.640
SAM: Okay.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.653
MATT: Your dex modifier is, for the ship,

00:24:19.653 --> 00:24:21.160
the dex is four. The modifier is minus three.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.230
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking balls, right,

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.370
so that would be only a two, so 15.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.203
MATT: 15?

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.052
15?

00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:31.751
TRAVIS: What does that mean? The higher dex?

00:24:31.751 --> 00:24:34.992
MATT: That means you guys are going at the same time.

00:24:34.992 --> 00:24:36.530
I'll say roll one more time

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.780
to see just who nudges out on this.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.030
TRAVIS: 14, just flat 14.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.230
MATT: Flat 14?
TRAVIS: No modifiers.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.063
MATT: All right, 11.

00:24:44.063 --> 00:24:45.280
TRAVIS: Okay.
SAM: Hey!

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.460
LAURA: (pants)
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.760
TRAVIS: Well done, well done.
SAM: First victory.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.175
MATT: So you guys are just barely ahead of it.

00:24:50.175 --> 00:24:51.495
TRAVIS: (hollering) Master Gunner!

00:24:51.495 --> 00:24:53.080
SAM: Yes, Captain Tusktooth!

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.900
TRAVIS: I need you to prepare three people per cannon.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.900
That is how we will be able to fire a cannon each action,

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.270
but only two of our four cannons per side.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.700
SAM: This is a lot of math.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.710
MARISHA: Do we have that many people on the ship?

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.480
TRAVIS: You stay with me.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.660
SAM: You have four people doing full speed ahead, right now.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.493
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:25:13.493 --> 00:25:15.250
SAM: So that leaves the people--

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.800
LAURA: Here?
SAM: Here,

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.510
to help me with my cannonry.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.040
TRAVIS: Full Speed Ahead was only for one turn.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.330
We'd have to do it, each turn.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:22.470
SAM: Yeah, but you need those four people

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.303
to do it, each turn, right?

00:25:23.303 --> 00:25:24.330
TRAVIS: Not anymore.
MARISHA: You also have Gallan,

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.130
Orly, Shelda, and Marius.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.270
TRAVIS: We made five feet on him, that turn.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.880
If I didn't roll a six, which is what I rolled,

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.740
the highest, he's going to gain each turn,

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.280
so we need to start getting ready.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.200
If you're cool with it, the ship has,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.530
the hull has 500 hit points.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.330
So I think we need to fight from that.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.210
SAM: "If you're cool with it?"

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.910
You're the captain. Tell us what to do!

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.460
TRAVIS: No, this is me, Travis, talking.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.050
SAM: No, you're the captain!

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.260
TRAVIS: We're going to go down fighting!

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.550
SAM: Yes!
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.850
LIAM: What's the rough distance, did we say,

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.960
between us and it?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.020
TRAVIS: 200 feet.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.120
LAURA: But can the cannons do more damage

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.320
than spells against him?

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.880
TRAVIS: It depends.
LIAM: No.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.130
TRAVIS: It can do 8d10 bludgeoning damage, if it hits.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.960
LAURA: That's great.
TRAVIS: If it hits.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.793
ASHLEY: Wait, how many cannons are

00:26:10.793 --> 00:26:11.720
on this side?
SAM: If it hits?

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.210
It'll hit.
MATT: Four cannons on each side.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.330
SAM: My crew is tip-top.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.162
TRAVIS: It's only a plus six to hit.

00:26:16.162 --> 00:26:18.140
Maybe I'll make you roll for the cannon fire.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.230
MATT: To shoot a cannon every round,

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.240
it needs three people manning it,

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.810
because one person to load, one person to aim,

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:22.960
and one person to actually fire.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.300
SAM: How many cannons do we have?

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.580
MATT: Four on each side.
TRAVIS: We have four on each side,

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.200
but we can only operate two per round,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.080
and I figure, because we used Control Water,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.570
the last time we had a chance to engage,

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:32.403
and we haven't really don't it,

00:26:32.403 --> 00:26:34.740
let's just fucking try it, and if it starts to go shitty,

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.350
then we can break up and go individually.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.360
MATT: Now, as a note too, to fire cannons from the side

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.840
of the ship, when you're going forward,

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.120
you have to turn.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.290
TRAVIS: I know.
MATT: So just

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.520
make sure you're aware of that.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.740
LAURA: Oh no!
TRAVIS: They don't come out,

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.316
and automatically (whirring)?

00:26:46.316 --> 00:26:47.970
(laughter)

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.930
MATT: Unfortunately, it's not Hupperdook-made.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.260
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.160
SAM: Captain, should I Pack the Good Powder?

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.480
TRAVIS: Not yet, because you have

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.000
to be really, really close.
MATT: Not yet.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.233
SAM: All right.

00:26:59.233 --> 00:27:00.833
By the way, I might say

00:27:00.833 --> 00:27:04.580
that you're taking a sense of commanding in this.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.620
It's very, it's sort of turning me on, a little bit.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.913
TRAVIS: It's just all urine, below this table.

00:27:07.913 --> 00:27:09.740
LAURA: Hey, Veth.
SAM: What, what?

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.841
LAURA: Fucking get to the cannons.

00:27:10.841 --> 00:27:12.730
SAM: Oh, well, okay, I'm sorry.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.032
I was just complimenting the captain, ooh!

00:27:15.032 --> 00:27:17.120
(laughter)

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.990
TALIESIN: Spicy.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.823
MATT: All right.
SAM: All right,

00:27:18.823 --> 00:27:20.980
so I'll go down and take, I guess, the crew.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.060
Can I take the crew?

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.170
TRAVIS: Our range, so you know, is 120 feet.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.890
Anything farther than that, we're at disadvantage.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.210
So we got to get them closer, right.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.610
That's why we bought the round for,

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.510
so you'll have time to move to the cannons,

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.930
three per cannon.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.720
SAM: Can I take the crew, or do you need them

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.960
to do full speed ahead?
TRAVIS: You can take all four

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.190
of the crew, and it's just the First Mate and I

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.023
are going to stay out here.

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.810
ASHLEY: I'll come with.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.450
LAURA: All of us will.
TRAVIS: When we get in range,

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.650
we'll move to Fire at Will,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.630
which means she or I will join you,

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.511
and it'll give us a bonus on one of those shots.

00:27:46.511 --> 00:27:48.065
But we'll prep them.

00:27:48.065 --> 00:27:49.360
SAM: Okay.
MATT: Just for the purposes of,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.510
I've set up an arrangement here,

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.188
so we know where everyone is in the ship.

00:27:53.188 --> 00:27:56.445
We're going in a similar set-up here.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:01.410
So you're sending the crew down into the--

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.540
SAM: Wow!
MATT: -- the cannon deck.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.410
SAM: Look at these--
LAURA: What if he eats the side

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.950
of the boat, and we're all underwater?

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.390
Oh, good thing we can breathe.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:08.223
SAM: And walk.

00:28:08.223 --> 00:28:09.630
ASHLEY: We can breathe and walk.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.050
MATT: And as well as Veth is heading down into the--

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.050
TRAVIS: This is all conceptual.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.360
We've never done this before.
MATT: And Yasha's going down,

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.790
as well?
ASHLEY: I'm going down, too.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.083
SAM: So we'll take two cannons.

00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:18.572
ASHLEY: Four--
MATT: All right.

00:28:18.572 --> 00:28:20.500
ASHLEY: We have four crew and then you and me.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.250
That's enough to--

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.320
SAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Two cannons?

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.320
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: You got it, okay.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.150
Where are the rest of you?

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.360
LAURA: Should we help with the cannons?

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.343
SAM: No, we're okay.
LAURA: Or should we be on the deck?

00:28:31.343 --> 00:28:32.176
SAM: You just stay on deck.

00:28:32.176 --> 00:28:33.830
TRAVIS: If the First Mate would stay

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.930
at the bridge that goes down to the galley,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.445
just so I have eyesight with you--

00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:38.490
MARISHA: Copy.
TRAVIS: -- and I'll stay at the helm.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.070
LAURA: Then me and you, Caleb, can--

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.990
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: So you're staying

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.823
up here?
LAURA: -- use spells.

00:28:41.823 --> 00:28:42.910
You too, Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.560
MARISHA: I'll be the walkie-talkie.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.960
LIAM: Improvise.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.480
TALIESIN: I'll stay near the bottom, near the stairs.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.990
That's right, stairs.
MATT: Are you at the helm?

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.823
All right, cool.

00:28:53.823 --> 00:28:55.620
LAURA: I'm going to stay near the side.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.760
MATT: Spinning the wheel as

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.260
Fjord's looking over, shouting orders.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.427
Caduceus?
SAM: Why are you turning so much?

00:29:01.427 --> 00:29:04.761
TRAVIS: Isn't this how you drive in the movies?

00:29:04.761 --> 00:29:06.560
LIAM: Whoa, whoa!
MATT: Where are you guys?

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.530
LAURA: We're at the side of the boat.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.110
LIAM: Yeah, facing towards the turtle.
TRAVIS: Serpentine, serpentine!

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.567
MATT: Right now, the turtle's behind you guys,

00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:15.290
like back this way.
TALIESIN: One on either side.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.590
LIAM: Then leaning out over the side, looking back--

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.390
MATT: Okay, so you guys look off this way.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.290
LIAM: I like turtles.
MATT: And Caduceus,

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.956
you would've been up here, when you first noticed it.

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:22.789
TALIESIN: Sure.

00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:23.622
MATT: So do you want to move back down to the side,

00:29:23.622 --> 00:29:25.210
or do you want to stay up here?

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.890
TALIESIN: I'll stay up there, for now, and keep an eye.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.370
LAURA: And then I'll be on the opposite side

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.220
of Caleb, just to--
TRAVIS: Beau, after this round

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.260
of attacks, you'll move down to the cannon,

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.340
and we'll do a Fire at Will.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.670
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Because he has to be close.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.350
MARISHA: Okay, copy that.
LAURA: I'll be on the other side.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.960
MATT: Other side, you got it.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.570
All right, Jester is on this side.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.370
SAM: Captain, which side of the cannonry should we prepare,

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.370
the starboard or port?

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.360
Captain!

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.100
TRAVIS: Let's do (sighs),

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.280
let's do starboard.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.172
SAM: That's the right side, Yasha!

00:29:52.172 --> 00:29:53.580
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.720
TRAVIS: I'm right-handed, so fuck it.
MARISHA: He peeks at his cheat sheet,

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.220
in the back of his flask.
TALIESIN: Just whatever brings it

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.310
to the wind, I suppose would be the way to go.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.570
MATT: Nevertheless, you've taken--

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:06.390
so for this next turn, as you've done-- after this,

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.790
you're setting people into their different locations.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.303
Everyone's scattering to their places.

00:30:10.303 --> 00:30:11.730
All right, so everyone gets to their places.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.630
TRAVIS: And actually, if I'm reading this right,

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.430
Fire at Will grants advantage on the next attack roll,

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.170
not this one, right, because we have to get into place?

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.003
MATT: Correct.

00:30:19.003 --> 00:30:21.550
TRAVIS: So, Beau, let's go ahead and Fire at Will--

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.040
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: -- for the next round.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.980
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Because he'll close

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.100
within that-- I think,

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.100
he'll close within that 120-foot distance.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.330
MARISHA: Okay.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.580
Come on, bitches!

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.500
Man your cannons!

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.810
TRAVIS: The first mate will be joining the first

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.310
of the two cannons.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.130
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.270
So as you guys all situate, you now watch

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:45.020
as the ship begins to slow from that first round

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.870
of immediate forceful push of movement.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.480
The dragon turtle itself begins

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.950
to increase its speed as best as it can.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.320
The sides of the wake, the water itself, is now starting

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.620
to (hisses) spray up at the sides of its shell,

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.920
as it seems to be rising up more and more,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.580
and you're getting a better view of just the intense mass

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.410
of this creature, but it just takes its turn,

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.750
just careening towards you, double move,

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.120
and it's gaining.
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.220
MATT: So now we come back to the ship's next round.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.710
So that closes it.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.970
You're able to move that round--

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.350
TRAVIS: Yeah, Fire at Will was the first action.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.233
Second action is the turn. So we're starting

00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:18.066
to turn towards starboard.
MATT: Correct,

00:31:18.066 --> 00:31:19.780
so you guys are turning and heading over towards starboard,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.292
which will put you in this direction there.

00:31:23.292 --> 00:31:25.934
And we'll shift it like this, because it's fun to do that.

00:31:25.934 --> 00:31:28.038
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (screeching)

00:31:28.038 --> 00:31:29.067
TALIESIN: Drift.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:31:29.067 --> 00:31:30.460
MATT: (laughs)

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.270
And that brings you to,

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.432
not a stop, but you guys coast.

00:31:34.432 --> 00:31:36.060
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.240
MATT: So with the speed of it, per round, is--

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.770
TRAVIS: 35.
MATT: 35?

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:40.970
TRAVIS: Unassisted, without-- yeah.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:41.840
No wind, right?

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.190
Turning doesn't put us in one or the other?

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.450
MATT: Turning this direction, if you're going to this side--

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:47.407
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, I should've checked which way

00:31:47.407 --> 00:31:48.240
the wind was fucking--
MATT: Yeah.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.073
You did not check that.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:49.906
SAM: (laughs)

00:31:49.906 --> 00:31:52.040
MATT: But it doesn't (laughs).

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.240
TRAVIS: Eh, who gives a shit?

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.850
SAM: You're not the navigator. Orly is.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.920
TRAVIS: Well, that's true.
MATT: No, but it puts you

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.360
in the direction of the wind.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.193
LAURA: Oh good!
MATT: So it's not coming

00:32:00.193 --> 00:32:01.026
against you.
TALIESIN: Oh, I meant to do that.

00:32:01.026 --> 00:32:02.760
MATT: If you'd gone to the port side,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.510
it would've been against you.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.257
You got lucky, for not checking.

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:07.920
TRAVIS: So the speed's 50 now?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.753
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:32:08.753 --> 00:32:09.586
MATT: When it moves on its turn.

00:32:09.586 --> 00:32:11.360
TRAVIS: Right, right, thank you.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.570
MATT: So you were at 200, end of last round.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.770
It's going to roll to try and pull out

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.920
of the vortex that you left.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.870
That is a 19.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.820
Is it your spell DC?

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.890
TALIESIN: It's 17.
MATT: So yeah.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.230
So it does manage to escape from it,

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.360
but you did slow it a little bit.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.790
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.330
MATT: It gains an additional 80 feet on you,

00:32:30.402 --> 00:32:31.560
which brings it to 120.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.035
You guys move, with the rotation turn

00:32:35.035 --> 00:32:37.401
there, I'd say 15 feet.

00:32:37.401 --> 00:32:40.510
So that brings it to 135 feet from you.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.079
TRAVIS: 135?
MATT: Yeah.

00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:46.530
I'll put it at half speed because of the turn,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.230
as you went in that way.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.330
Back to your turn now, the ship's go.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.010
TRAVIS: So 135 feet, it's just without our--

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.350
MARISHA: It's just outside our range.
TRAVIS: Just outside of our range.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.510
Are we perfectly perpendicular to it?

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:01.393
MATT: You are now, yes.

00:33:01.393 --> 00:33:02.600
TRAVIS: We are?

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.120
Fucking light it up.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.200
SAM: Remember, everyone,

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.680
don't fire until you hear the proper chain of command.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.090
It has to go Fjord, first.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:12.100
Then it goes to our first mate,

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.421
then to me, then to Yasha.

00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:14.830
Then we do the command.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.040
TRAVIS: Okay.
ASHLEY: Copy.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.520
TRAVIS: First mate, light it up!

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.200
MARISHA: Fire at will!
LIAM: Ooh!

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.790
SAM: Fire at will.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.955
ASHLEY: (uncertain) Firing.

00:33:21.955 --> 00:33:24.270
(laughter)

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.310
MATT: You watch, rapidly, as the rest

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.730
of your crew loads up two cannonballs,

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.350
one into each of the starboard-side cannons,

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.270
that you guys are currently manning.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.930
On opposite ends of it, other crew help pull and aim it,

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.950
as you get it towards the direction

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:38.602
of this massive creature.

00:33:38.602 --> 00:33:41.498
(heavy swimming)

00:33:41.498 --> 00:33:43.180
LAURA: Are you allowed to cast spells?
MATT: Just sprays of water.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.013
We'll get to that

00:33:44.013 --> 00:33:45.010
in just a second.
LAURA: Okay!

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:45.843
TRAVIS: Quiet.

00:33:45.843 --> 00:33:49.326
MATT: As it emerges, you all (sizzling).

00:33:49.326 --> 00:33:50.780
(explosion)

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.380
The cannons come flying back about 10 or so feet

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.960
from the blast impact of it, and Yasha,

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.237
make a strength check, if you want to.

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:00.903
ASHLEY: If I want to?
SAM: She's fucking holding a cannon.

00:34:00.903 --> 00:34:02.096
MATT: Yeah, if you want to try and keep it at bay.

00:34:02.096 --> 00:34:04.016
ASHLEY: 'Cause I was like, nah.

00:34:04.016 --> 00:34:05.540
MATT: Maybe if you'd let it go.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.650
ASHLEY: Ah, shit, it's cocked.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.625
Oh, oh, this is good, okay.

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:14.730
(groans) Oh boy, math, 27, total.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.790
SAM: Oh wow!
MATT: 27!

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.130
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:17.963
MATT: Whew!

00:34:17.963 --> 00:34:18.796
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:34:18.796 --> 00:34:20.290
MATT: That was a strength--
ASHLEY: Wait, hold on a second.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.270
MATT: Strength check?

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.345
ASHLEY: Nope, apologies.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.483
22, 22!

00:34:25.483 --> 00:34:26.870
MATT: 22, still really good.
ASHLEY: Sorry.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.850
MATT: So as one cannon rolls back, 10 feet,

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.660
and, Veth, you have to, like, step aside real fast,

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.760
as you guys begin to push it back into place.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.860
Yasha, you take the brunt of it, in your chest.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.950
Your feet dig

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:38.830
into the already partially splintered floor

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.980
from the previous battle that the ship had endured.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.320
And as you dig in and push back,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.850
you only go about three feet.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.250
You're, actually, heels digging about three inches

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:51.096
into the wood, as it's splintering
behind you, and you stop--

00:34:51.096 --> 00:34:52.110
ASHLEY: (grunts)
MATT: -- in your tracks

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.650
and push it right back to the entrance of the gun port.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.200
LIAM: Flex!
ASHLEY: (booming sound)

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.810
TRAVIS: So one cannon will get advantage on its fire.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.220
The second one's a straight roll.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.650
SAM: Who's rolling?

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.370
MATT: You guys are firing, so you guys roll.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.250
Which one of you is taking advantage?

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.310
SAM: You take advantage.
ASHLEY: Why?

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.720
SAM: I'm, I--
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.930
SAM: I'm an expert cannoneer.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.320
TRAVIS: Let's dominate the situation.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.860
MATT: The bonus to this is plus--

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.093
TRAVIS: Six.
MATT: So plus six to the roll.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:18.753
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.900
23.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.160
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:24.993
Yeah, plus six, yeah.

00:35:24.993 --> 00:35:25.900
MATT: Plus six.
ASHLEY: 23.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.750
SAM: 11!

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.480
MATT: So the blast of the cannon,

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.930
the reason it shot back so hard

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.430
on Nott's side was it was a little bit too well packed,

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.240
and the flare on the blast of the flame

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.540
and the actual firing of the cannon was too strong,

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.480
and as such, it goes wide.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.960
You watch it actually overshoot the creature

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.020
and then vanish (splashes) into the ocean behind.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.348
SAM: Goddamn it, Marius!

00:35:47.348 --> 00:35:49.470
MATT and LAURA: (laugh)

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.330
MATT: However, you do notice

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.700
that you Yasha's does (explosion) impact

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.342
and explode across the outside of his shell.

00:35:55.342 --> 00:35:56.220
TRAVIS: Whoa, good hit!

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.540
MATT: You can go ahead and roll damage on that one,

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.010
which is--
TRAVIS: 8d10.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.150
LAURA and ASHLEY: 8d10?!

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.519
MATT: 8d10 bludgeoning damage.

00:36:01.519 --> 00:36:02.750
LAURA: What, what!

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.900
TRAVIS: We might as well. This ship's our baby.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.150
We're going to ride or die.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.130
LAURA: Yeah.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.690
ASHLEY: I haven't rolled a 10 in a minute.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.150
SAM: First mate, P to RL!

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.983
MARISHA: P, uh--

00:36:11.983 --> 00:36:13.332
SAM: Permission to reload!

00:36:13.332 --> 00:36:14.690
MARISHA: Uh, of course!

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.090
Fucking-- you don't need my permission.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.340
TRAVIS: (laughing) P to RL!

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.340
Is that a real thing?

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.890
SAM: No, I just made it up.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.840
Chain of command, chain of command!

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.230
MARISHA: Real words here!

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.063
SAM: It's boat talk!

00:36:27.063 --> 00:36:28.370
TRAVIS: I don't know that terminology!

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:29.828
SAM: It's boat talk!

00:36:29.828 --> 00:36:32.611
(laughter)

00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:34.117
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.930
SAM: Marius, reload.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.330
And do it better this time.

00:36:42.688 --> 00:36:44.180
ASHLEY: Oh, nice.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.180
SAM: Nice!

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.013
TALIESIN: Nice.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.588
SAM: Must be 69 points.
ASHLEY: 53!

00:36:48.588 --> 00:36:49.820
SAM: Oh, whoa!
MATT: Nice.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.970
SAM: That's great!
MATT: 53 points

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.445
of bludgeoning damage to the dragon turtle.

00:36:56.155 --> 00:36:57.250
(explosion) It impacts.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.860
You can see bits of the outer shell itself

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.010
splinter and crack,

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.230
and shards flying off from the impact.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.680
The cannonball itself, you see, after it blasts into it,

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.170
is actually wedged in the shell now.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.038
It's stuck in it.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.480
There is smoke billowing out the front of it,

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.360
but you push it back into place.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.880
Marius is like, "All right, I'm trying! Come on!"

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.530
And he's going to load it back in.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.830
So that's the two attack actions

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.160
that turn.
TRAVIS: It is.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.480
MATT: Your ship is now perpendicular,

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.780
and while the wind is going with it,

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.360
it's only trailing at 50 miles per hour in that direction.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.450
SAM: 50 miles an hour.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.460
MATT: At a perpendicular rate.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.100
It is now the dragon turtle's turn.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.919
It's going to take an 80-foot movement action.

00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:35.628
LAURA: Oh, but I wanted to cast a spell.

00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:36.461
LIAM: Yeah.

00:37:36.461 --> 00:37:37.310
MATT: Yep.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:38.143
So you guys?

00:37:38.143 --> 00:37:38.976
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.080
MATT: Generally, it's, like, ship combat goes back and forth

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.280
between things, but because we have casters on board,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.113
what do you guys want to do?

00:37:45.113 --> 00:37:47.270
LIAM: What's the distance, roughly, right now?

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.570
MATT: Right now, it's about 135 feet,

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.403
if you're taking your turn.

00:37:49.403 --> 00:37:50.390
LAURA: I wanted--
LIAM: No, we're, go.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.180
You go.
LAURA: I wanted to cast--

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.410
after seeing Caduceus do it,

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:55.550
I wanted to cast a Whirlpool,

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:56.730
in front of the turtle as well,

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.560
to keep it from ramming the boat.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.020
MATT: Okay, cool, all right.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.620
So it is a strength saving throw?

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.453
LAURA: Yes.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:10.150
SAM: Oh, Fjord, should I Pack the Good Powder?

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.047
TRAVIS: Not yet.

00:38:11.047 --> 00:38:11.980
SAM: Goddamn it.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.120
TRAVIS: It's only a 1d10, extra bludgeoning damage.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.560
If we roll a one or two--
MATT: 22.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.990
TRAVIS: -- it kills the cannon.
LAURA: 17.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:18.440
MATT: Okay, so it doesn't take any bludgeoning damage.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.273
LAURA: But it slows him down.

00:38:19.273 --> 00:38:21.490
MATT: But it does pull him 10 feet towards it,

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.300
which will slow its advancement by 10 feet.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.340
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: And it has to make a check

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.990
to try and escape it, next round.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.800
LIAM: We've already blasted, right, with cannons?

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.633
Yeah, sure.

00:38:29.633 --> 00:38:32.770
MATT: That lowers its movement there by 10,

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:33.700
and what are you doing?

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.470
LIAM: Caleb slaps some sulfur and batshit together

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:37.590
and pulls his hands apart,

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:41.380
and a 5th-level Fireball pulls out between his hands,

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.440
and I'm going to lob it.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.590
It is 150-foot distance towards the dragon turtle.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.620
That is a dex save.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.493
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: I love that you

00:38:48.493 --> 00:38:52.050
low-key asked if we were going to, like, mix it up.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.210
We shot it with a cannon, right?

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:54.992
Okay, (claps) oh fuck it!

00:38:54.992 --> 00:38:56.848
(laughter)

00:38:56.848 --> 00:38:57.910
SAM: Nuclear weapon.
MATT: 16!

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:58.930
TRAVIS: Doctor Manhattan.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:00.090
LIAM: Fail, it's a failure.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.200
MATT: All right, so go ahead and do damage.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.033
LIAM: That is...

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.780
♪ Do, doo, doo, dah, doo, dah, la, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo ♪

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.120
I lost it. Where did you go?

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.667
I lost it, I lost it.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.091
Okay, so it's 8d6.
ASHLEY: Oh!

00:39:12.091 --> 00:39:14.160
TRAVIS: I think. I mean, we're in the water, so--

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.310
LIAM: Okay, here we go, 10d6.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:21.640
Two, 12, 18, 22,

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.040
26, 30, 36,

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.120
42 points of fire damage.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.420
TRAVIS: Nice!
MATT: 42.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.086
All righty.
SAM: It'll be dead before it gets to us.

00:39:29.086 --> 00:39:31.210
MATT: The fireball blasts on its shell.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.590
TRAVIS: You shut up (laughs).

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.810
MATT: Seems to not have as much impact as you had hoped.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:36.960
SAM: Aw!

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.810
LIAM: But a little impact.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:38.998
MATT: A little impact.
LIAM: Got it.

00:39:38.998 --> 00:39:41.490
MATT: But the dark burn mark on it,

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:43.450
the shell beneath it is pretty solid

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:44.920
and holding in place.
LIAM: Understood.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.660
TRAVIS: Not a deep impact.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.190
Kind of an impact.
MATT: Yeah.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:51.400
LIAM: Yeah, maybe avoid fire.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.600
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: All right.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.510
Now coming to its turn, that's double movement

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:58.770
at 70 feet gained, because of the whirlpool.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.130
That puts it at--

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.770
LAURA: Does it have to make a
save to get out of the whirlpool?

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.810
MATT: It doesn't make it completely out of the range,

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.726
because of the distance to get through that.

00:40:08.726 --> 00:40:09.612
So it has to do that next round.

00:40:09.612 --> 00:40:11.450
TALIESIN: But if it starts its turn in the whirlpool,

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.065
it has to make that save as well.

00:40:13.065 --> 00:40:15.385
MATT: It does, as well?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:40:15.385 --> 00:40:16.426
LIAM: I love the boats battles!

00:40:16.426 --> 00:40:17.259
MATT: 19.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.331
SAM: So cool.
MATT: It's awesome.

00:40:20.331 --> 00:40:22.950
All right, sorry.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.704
My brain is not used to math.

00:40:24.704 --> 00:40:28.088
TRAVIS: This page is so intense.

00:40:28.088 --> 00:40:29.180
There's so much on here.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.753
ASHLEY: Wait, turn it around. Not that I could see it.

00:40:31.753 --> 00:40:32.890
A lot going on there.
MATT: All right.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.950
It gets within 65 feet of the ship,

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.672
which now means you can see it.

00:40:37.672 --> 00:40:39.443
ALL: Ooh!

00:40:39.443 --> 00:40:42.032
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh no!

00:40:42.032 --> 00:40:43.385
MARISHA: Oh, he's so cute!

00:40:43.385 --> 00:40:45.018
TRAVIS: I don't want it!
LAURA: He is really cute, though.

00:40:45.018 --> 00:40:45.851
TRAVIS: I don't like it!

00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:47.350
MARISHA: Oh!
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:48.400
SAM: But that's just--
LIAM: He's so big.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.440
SAM: That's just a turtle.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.820
That's, like, an actual turtle.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.120
TRAVIS: That's like Squirt from Finding Nemo.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.603
LAURA: Oh, he's just really big.

00:40:55.603 --> 00:40:56.453
TRAVIS: Noggin!

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:58.040
LAURA: Maybe he's nice.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.570
TRAVIS: Oh lord.
LAURA: Not anymore.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.260
LIAM: We shot him up.
MATT: Yep, 65 feet.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.620
So you can now see it currently coming towards the ship,

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.180
and as it's coming to this level,

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:15.180
you see it beginning to submerge beneath the water.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.740
TRAVIS: Can dragon turtles, can they talk?

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.700
Okay.
MATT: I don't know.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.538
You guys shot it with cannonballs.

00:41:22.538 --> 00:41:25.070
It hasn't had a chance to converse yet.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:25.903
LAURA: Oh no.

00:41:25.903 --> 00:41:27.310
MATT: But it is now going beneath the water.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.445
LIAM: I say, old chap, would you stop firing at me?

00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:30.973
(laughter)

00:41:30.973 --> 00:41:33.975
LAURA: He did seem angry, though, when he came up and out.

00:41:33.975 --> 00:41:35.333
TRAVIS: It was his face. He had a real--

00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:37.820
LAURA: He has the angry eyebrows.
MATT: Yeah, angry eyebrows.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.000
MARISHA: Drawn on with Sharpie.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.198
MATT: It is about 10 feet beneath the water's surface now.

00:41:42.198 --> 00:41:44.540
The actual-- its shell is now below the water,

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.440
and you can see the water bubbling up over it

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.950
from the displacement.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:52.598
TRAVIS: Would I know, from my years of sailing,

00:41:52.598 --> 00:41:57.598
if 10 feet of water does anything to
a cannonball fired into it?

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.954
MATT: It might.

00:41:58.954 --> 00:42:01.610
LAURA: (groans)
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:02.620
Cool.
MATT: I mean, cannonballs

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.230
are pretty big, and there's a lot of heft behind it.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.630
It is pretty close.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.010
It may or may not.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:08.843
It's right on that cusp,

00:42:08.843 --> 00:42:10.920
10 feet, with that much force.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.540
It's a lot of water to displace, though,

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.920
to get to its target, so you won't know until you try.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.500
Nevertheless, it's now back to the ship

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.500
and the party's turn.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.690
So what do you want to do?

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:23.760
TRAVIS: We're going to empty both cannons at it, again.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.010
No Fire at Will, because you have to do it

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.510
on the previous turn.
MARISHA: Copy.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.613
TRAVIS: Go for it.

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:30.580
SAM: Awaiting orders.

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.430
MARISHA: Hit 'em again!

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.610
SAM: Light 'em up!

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:34.592
ASHLEY: Here we go!

00:42:34.592 --> 00:42:37.130
(laughter)

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.550
MATT: Loading the cannons back up,

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.190
both of you guys take shots with disadvantage.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.023
ASHLEY: Disadvantage?

00:42:42.023 --> 00:42:43.556
TRAVIS: I thought it was within 120.

00:42:43.556 --> 00:42:45.040
Is he beyond 120?

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.210
MATT: It's because he's under the water.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.510
LAURA: Is he fully under?

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.360
MATT: He's about 10 feet below the surface.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.850
LAURA: (blows raspberry)

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.340
SAM: That would be a natural one.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.590
MATT: Ah!
MARISHA: Jeez.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.040
ASHLEY: 17.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.680
MATT: 17, okay.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.120
Both of the cannons fire off

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.138
and, boom, boom, big sprays into the ocean, but no impact

00:43:04.138 --> 00:43:05.651
on the target.
ASHLEY: Goddamn it!

00:43:05.651 --> 00:43:06.760
SAM: Dammit.
MARISHA: That was an awesome

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.630
splash, though.
SAM: It was.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.480
MARISHA: That was dope.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.481
LAURA: Uh-oh!

00:43:11.481 --> 00:43:12.850
This is going to go real bad.

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.950
ASHLEY: Maybe it was a good distraction.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:16.090
SAM: Yeah, maybe, maybe.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.250
It certainly looks cool in slow motion.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.930
P to RL?

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:21.999
MARISHA: Yes.

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:22.974
SAM: Reload!

00:43:22.974 --> 00:43:24.260
TRAVIS: Seeing that not how--

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.330
I'm also going to just shout out: Brace!

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.400
Just because it seems like it's going low and approaching.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.500
I know they have their turns,

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.780
but just so people are aware of the shit above their heads.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.913
MATT: No worries.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.620
Caduceus, everyone else?

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.000
TALIESIN: Is it within 60 feet, at this point?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.780
MATT: From you, right now, on that side, no.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.210
It is about 80 feet from you.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.076
TALIESIN: I'm happy to go down,

00:43:47.076 --> 00:43:50.474
move as close as I can to--

00:43:50.474 --> 00:43:52.660
MATT: Okay, it's 65 feet from the boat,

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.160
so it's about 65 feet from you,

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.620
as close as you can get to it.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.790
TALIESIN: 65 is as close as I can get to it?

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.629
MATT: Yes, because anything more, you're in the water.

00:43:59.629 --> 00:44:01.648
TALIESIN: (sighs)

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:03.943
That's too far.

00:44:03.943 --> 00:44:05.910
LAURA: (laughs)

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.592
TALIESIN: That makes me unhappy.

00:44:07.592 --> 00:44:08.990
TRAVIS: You want me to throw out the parachute,

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.501
and we'll just slow down a little bit?

00:44:10.501 --> 00:44:13.500
TALIESIN: Man.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.243
All right, I'm going to-- okay,
I'm going to try something else.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.730
If I use Redirect Flow,

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.450
can I make the boat suddenly move faster?

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.260
LAURA: Well, we're stopped, right?

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.040
MATT: You guys have spun, and you fired,

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.210
and the wind's starting to pick up,

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.440
so it does get to move a little bit,

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.480
on its turn, but it's not...

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.680
Well, actually, for the actions there,

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.520
you have the two actions are--?

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.645
TRAVIS: We fired both cannons.
MATT: Correct.

00:44:48.645 --> 00:44:49.910
TRAVIS: But you can also turn or do other things.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.720
But we haven't turned, because
we're still where we need to be.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.540
MATT: Right, you guys are still there.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.450
So I'd say, for right now, you're just coasting

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:58.070
with the wind, which is 15 feet.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.590
TRAVIS: 50, if we're with.

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:00.423
MATT: Right, because you're with it there.

00:45:00.423 --> 00:45:01.760
So it'd be, yeah, so it'd be 50 feet.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.735
You're just going in that
direction, after the turn.

00:45:03.735 --> 00:45:05.218
TRAVIS: And he's just doing...

00:45:05.218 --> 00:45:07.610
MATT: Yeah, so you're turning around it a bit.

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:11.370
TALIESIN: Hmm, okay, so that really...

00:45:12.855 --> 00:45:13.780
LAURA: (laughs)

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:17.071
TALIESIN: So I wouldn't be able to
speed this up, really, at this point.

00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:18.630
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't think we're trying to outrun anything.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:19.890
TALIESIN: All right, I'm just going to hold on,

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:22.680
and I'm going to hold a spell until...

00:45:25.293 --> 00:45:26.930
He's-- well, no, I can do it now.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:28.820
I'm going to try and just sideswipe him

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.430
so that he misses the boat, so that he's no longer

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:32.263
on course towards us--

00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:33.763
TRAVIS: A little Hunt for Red October.
TALIESIN: -- with the Redirect Flow,

00:45:33.763 --> 00:45:34.960
under the water.
ASHLEY: Tight.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.538
MATT: Okay, so you're using Redirect Flow?

00:45:36.538 --> 00:45:38.020
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.111
MATT: Okay.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.163
TALIESIN: So... yeah.
TRAVIS: Close the distance.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.400
TALIESIN: So yeah, I can just make water within 300 feet go

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.720
in whichever direction I want,

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.780
and I'm going to just try and--
I'm not going to do it directly.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.870
I'm just going to try and sideswipe it.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.270
MATT: What level spell is it?

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:56.560
TALIESIN: That's a 4th-level spell.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.200
MATT: 4th-level spell.
LAURA: It's Control Water.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.400
TALIESIN: It's Control Water.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.510
MATT: Oh, it's Control Water.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.200
I was like, what is Redirect Flow?

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.130
SAM: Redirect Flow, you know.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:05.750
TALIESIN: It's one of the subsets.
MATT: One of the subsets.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.416
I was looking for the spell "Redirect Flow."

00:46:07.416 --> 00:46:08.607
MATT: I was like, I don't remember that spell.

00:46:08.607 --> 00:46:09.440
LIAM: You know how Caduceus do.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.803
LAURA: Did she send that tonight?

00:46:10.803 --> 00:46:12.261
Oh (laughs).

00:46:12.261 --> 00:46:14.019
TRAVIS: What is wrong with his hair?

00:46:14.019 --> 00:46:16.265
MATT: Okay. Uh--

00:46:17.465 --> 00:46:21.160
So as-- okay, so you as you move the water

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.570
beneath the surface, the Redirect Flow,

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.140
you're not certain it's going
to have much of an impact yet.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.250
You can't quite see, as it is just starting

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:29.590
to careen with that, in a sense,

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.040
but you feel the water flow direct,

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.010
going in that direction.
TALIESIN: Trying to throw him off.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.080
MATT: You got it. Next up.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.830
TALIESIN: And grabbing hold, grabbing hold.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.060
LIAM: Caleb will just prepare

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.550
with a raven feather in hand, will cast Fly

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.540
and hover up and hold on to the sail,

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.910
just to move with the ship, as it goes.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:50.110
MATT: Okay, so you will then head up into here.

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:50.943
LIAM: Yeah.

00:46:50.943 --> 00:46:51.776
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:46:51.776 --> 00:46:53.680
LIAM: Holding the sail and just hovering in the air.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.513
MATT: You got it.

00:46:54.513 --> 00:46:56.480
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- I don't know if this goes

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.160
through the water, but I can't imagine why it wouldn't,

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.300
Guiding Bolt, at level five.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.133
MATT: Go for it.

00:47:04.133 --> 00:47:05.130
Go ahead and roll an attack now.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:09.260
That, indeed, is not halted by the flow of water.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.093
SAM: Yeah.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.050
ASHLEY: Get to it.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.750
LAURA: I have too many dice to choose from, right now,

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:15.060
and I'm freaking out.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.242
TALIESIN: I'm an idiot.

00:47:16.242 --> 00:47:18.382
TRAVIS: It's finally happened!
MATT: Bailey problems.

00:47:18.382 --> 00:47:21.290
TRAVIS: Just a few.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.926
LAURA: (gasps) 28!

00:47:22.926 --> 00:47:23.759
MATT: 28 hits.

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:25.270
LIAM: Ooh.
ASHLEY: Ooh!

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.160
TRAVIS: Have we established what its AC is yet, ish?

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.510
LAURA: No, we haven't.
TALIESIN: No idea.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:32.490
LAURA: So that is 8d6 damage.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.330
MATT: Nice, and the next attack against it has--

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.690
LAURA: Gets advantage.
MATT: -- advantage.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:37.670
SAM: Nice.
TALIESIN: What kind of damage?

00:47:38.848 --> 00:47:40.980
MATT: Radiant.
TALIESIN: Nice.

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.556
LIAM: God damage.

00:47:42.556 --> 00:47:46.920
MATT: (laughs) God damage!

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.930
TRAVIS: That means even a
cannon shot would have advantage?

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:50.530
MATT: Yeah, whatever the next attack on it is.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:52.260
TRAVIS: That'll change what you do.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.760
ASHLEY: Wait, what are the cannons, 23?

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.500
What is it, 24?

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.640
LIAM: It's been a void in my life.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.960
TALIESIN: Oh man.
LIAM: Now it's back.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.740
LAURA: 35 points of radiant damage.

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.600
MATT: 35 points of radiant damage, nice.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.130
So as you look over the edge,

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:08.130
and for this, yeah, you peek over,

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:09.700
right as it's going beneath the surface,

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.970
and the bubbling of water starting to transition

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.500
over the shell, as it begins to vanish

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.430
into the dark depth below, you put your hands out

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:22.280
and release this bolt of divine, Traveler-guided energy

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.680
that gets brighter and brighter

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.460
as it just scoots into the water.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:29.002
It splashes back and (whooshes) like a depth charge,

00:48:29.002 --> 00:48:30.360
(explosion) beneath the water.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.877
LAURA: Cool.
MATT: For a second as it a blasts,

00:48:31.877 --> 00:48:34.000
you see the entire outline of the creature,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.833
and for the first time,

00:48:34.833 --> 00:48:38.310
you really see how massive this creature is.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.110
As there is this sparkling energy

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.750
that is currently encircling its entire body,

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.560
giving it this glowing halo, beneath the water.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.560
LAURA: It's a pink halo.
It's really beautiful.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.493
ASHLEY: It's beautiful.
TALIESIN: Oh, it looks great.

00:48:50.493 --> 00:48:51.751
ASHLEY: Wow.
MATT: Well done.

00:48:51.751 --> 00:48:53.850
LIAM: (whispering) I missed this.
MATT: All right.

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:54.927
Me too.
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too.

00:48:54.927 --> 00:48:57.110
MATT: So I think that everyone's done their turn--

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.890
SAM: I was doing cannon stuff.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.180
Can I also cast a spell on myself or--

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.916
MATT: No, your action was to fire, yeah.

00:49:02.916 --> 00:49:04.313
SAM: That's fine.

00:49:04.313 --> 00:49:06.360
MATT: All right, now it is the turtle's turn.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.768
You guys move 50 feet this way.

00:49:07.768 --> 00:49:11.190
At the trajectory it's at, I'll
say that adds about 25 feet

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.220
to the distance that you're at,

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.570
which puts it at 85.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.460
TRAVIS: It's going to change.
We're going to change it up.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.490
LAURA: Oh god.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.550
MATT: It's going to continue to disappear beneath the water.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:21.880
You can just barely see it, but it is currently--

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.230
LAURA: Did it fully escape the whirlpool?

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.230
MATT: It does need to check for that.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.761
That is, oh man...

00:49:30.095 --> 00:49:31.270
25.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.103
LAURA: (sadly) Yeah.

00:49:32.103 --> 00:49:34.223
MATT: It's got a high strength bonus. I'm sorry.

00:49:34.223 --> 00:49:35.056
ASHLEY: "Yeah."
LAURA: "Yeah."

00:49:35.056 --> 00:49:36.230
MATT: It's rolling really well on that.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.063
TALIESIN: Man.

00:49:37.063 --> 00:49:39.270
TRAVIS: The distance from the boat, it's now--

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:40.598
MATT: You don't know.

00:49:40.598 --> 00:49:41.781
It is--

00:49:41.781 --> 00:49:43.839
you can see--

00:49:43.839 --> 00:49:46.220
Okay, actually, because of the glow,

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.718
you do have an idea.

00:49:48.655 --> 00:49:51.080
It went down below, and it's now, like,

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.260
as you guys have moved forward--

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.361
LAURA: Ooh!
MARISHA: He's trying to get under the boat?

00:49:54.361 --> 00:49:57.940
MATT: It's now about there.
MARISHA: He's under the boat!

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.550
MATT: He's about five feet from the outside of the boat

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.159
and about 25 feet below, right now.

00:50:03.159 --> 00:50:04.920
TALIESIN: Did the current have any effect,

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:05.753
or is it having any--

00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:06.586
MATT: It did not, unfortunately.

00:50:06.586 --> 00:50:07.500
TALIESIN: Oh well, it was worth a try.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.590
LAURA: I just feel bad for him.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:11.600
MATT: Redirect Flow is, for this,
is just not powerful enough

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.730
to stop a creature of this size, unfortunately.

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:16.010
SAM: We scared him away, boys.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.330
TRAVIS: Can we see-- can I see, from my helm position,

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:22.240
that he is no longer in line of sight of the cannons?

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.772
MATT: Correct, you do see that, yeah.

00:50:23.772 --> 00:50:26.419
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:50:26.419 --> 00:50:27.300
Okay.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.490
Is it back to the boat's turn?

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:29.452
MATT: It is.

00:50:29.452 --> 00:50:31.090
TRAVIS: Okay. First Mate?

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:32.570
MARISHA: Yeah?

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.180
TRAVIS: Gallan, Marius, Delles.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.000
MARISHA: Gallan, Marion, Delles.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.270
TRAVIS: And, Beau, I want you to run

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.760
to the stern-side port cannon.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:48.160
No, actually, just Gallan, Marius, and Delles,

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.790
stern-side port cannon, just one.

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:52.310
Everybody else comes up--

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.690
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: -- from the galley.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.660
MARISHA: You three assholes, that cannon.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.930
Everybody else, on the deck.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:00.120
SAM: Wait, who's the asshole on the cannon?

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.440
TRAVIS: So you two are coming up.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.986
ASHLEY: We come up. Okay.
TRAVIS: From the galley.

00:51:02.986 --> 00:51:06.060
SAM: With all due respect, I will not leave my post.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.155
ASHLEY: Let's go.
SAM: Okay.

00:51:07.155 --> 00:51:12.155
(laughter)

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:15.330
MATT: So Marius, Gallan, and--

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:17.850
TRAVIS: Marius, Gallan, and Delles are on

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:19.710
that stern-side port cannon.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:20.930
MATT: All right, stern-side port cannon.

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:21.763
TALIESIN: Good god.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:24.040
Ho, ho!
MATT: All righty.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.850
TRAVIS: I'm sure there's a
more efficient way of saying that.

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:27.740
I just don't know.
LIAM: I love Matt's giant hands

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:28.630
on our view cam.

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:29.588
SAM: Yeah.

00:51:29.588 --> 00:51:32.140
MATT: And the other are staying where?

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.540
TRAVIS: Everybody else is coming up

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.270
out of the galley of the ship.
MATT: You got it.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:39.130
TRAVIS: As far as their speed'll let them move.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:40.300
MATT: At double speed, on their point,

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.240
I'll say that can get them to the deck, without issue.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.410
Yasha coming up as well?

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:44.243
ASHLEY: Yep.

00:51:44.243 --> 00:51:46.070
MATT: All righty, as well as Orly.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.570
TRAVIS: There's no reason to waste a cannon shot

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.070
when we have advantage from Guiding Bolt.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:50.530
So there was no reason to do Fire at Will.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:51.600
Just get everybody else up,

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.090
and you don't want to be under there when like--

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:53.923
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:51:53.923 --> 00:51:55.190
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Fair enough.

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:58.730
MARISHA: He's about to Jaws start eating this boat.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:00.347
TRAVIS: Maybe. Right, if he continues around,

00:52:00.347 --> 00:52:03.113
then we'll open it back up again, but--

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.980
Fire that first cannon.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:09.813
MARISHA: Okay.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.270
Gallan, Marius, fire!

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.320
LAURA: But do the cannonballs go underwater?

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.330
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:18.230
LAURA: They do?

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.390
TRAVIS: Yeah, but disadvantage and advantage

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:23.380
cancel each other out. So it's a straight shot.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.430
MATT: Okay, so if you want to roll for it then, Captain?

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.310
TRAVIS: Oh, sure.

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.410
Well, actually, the turtle hasn't moved

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:31.780
to the port side yet, right?

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.030
He's still--
MATT: Correct.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.360
TRAVIS: Right, so they've just finished the move.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.460
Then they'll just hold.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.418
MATT: Okay, they're just holding an action?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:52:36.418 --> 00:52:38.400
MATT: You got it. So when it appears, it's to fire.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.233
TRAVIS: Correct.
MATT: You got it.

00:52:39.233 --> 00:52:40.780
MARISHA: Fire <i>when</i> he appears!

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.940
MATT: Everyone else?

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:44.090
SAM: Fire when he appears.

00:52:44.953 --> 00:52:45.786
MATT: So--

00:52:45.786 --> 00:52:47.190
TRAVIS: You got to swear, if you're the First Mate.

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:48.540
They're not going to respect you, otherwise.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.700
MARISHA: You fucking douchebags!

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.900
TRAVIS: Much better.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.720
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and hold an action

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.762
until the turtle's within 60 feet.

00:52:56.762 --> 00:52:59.420
MATT: For Veth and Yasha, it took you guys,

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.340
to get to the deck, your turn, of, like, double move

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.430
to get up there.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:04.530
MATT: But you guys got up there okay.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:05.750
SAM: Great.
MATT: You're holding which one?

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:09.890
TALIESIN: Holding a spell until the turtle's within 60 feet.

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:10.800
MATT: What spell are you holding?

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.633
TALIESIN: Command.

00:53:11.633 --> 00:53:13.740
LAURA: Oh, I was going to do the same thing (laughs)!

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.280
MATT: All right, so we have two people holding Command, or--

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.860
LAURA: I mean, yeah, I would've done it,

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:18.800
if I hadn't heard you say it.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.040
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I've got it,
just because I can talk to animals.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.290
MATT: So you're both holding Command.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:24.840
TRAVIS: If you can see him, you can let it go.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:25.740
You can't see him?

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:27.850
TALIESIN: It's a 60-foot--

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:29.790
LAURA: It's a 60-foot--
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:32.740
Yeah, I don't think he's within 60 feet yet.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.890
TRAVIS: Is he within 60 feet?

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:36.350
MATT: Currently, yes.
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:38.230
LAURA: Oh, go for it.
TALIESIN: Then I'm casting Command.

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:39.750
MATT: Okay, what are you commanding?

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:40.583
TALIESIN: Flee.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.603
ASHLEY: What if that fucking worked?

00:53:44.603 --> 00:53:46.080
MARISHA: That would be amazing.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.680
TALIESIN: And I can talk to animals, so no matter what,

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.230
there's not a language barrier.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.400
MATT: It's not an animal.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.233
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:53:53.233 --> 00:53:55.423
LIAM: It's a monster!
LAURA: He's a turtle, though!

00:53:55.423 --> 00:53:56.323
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:53:56.323 --> 00:53:57.550
MATT: It's more dragon than turtle.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:01.130
TALIESIN: Oh, well, then-- Dragons speak Common anyway.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:02.270
MATT: What languages do you have?

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:03.640
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.410
TRAVIS: It's like a lion-fish. It's more a fish.

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:09.090
TALIESIN: I have Common, Elvish, Giant, and Sylvan.

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:10.380
MATT: What language do you speak it in?

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.970
LIAM: You have to speak turtle, dude.
TALIESIN: Common.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:12.861
MATT: Common?

00:54:12.861 --> 00:54:13.694
Okay.

00:54:14.629 --> 00:54:15.897
It doesn't seem to have any effect.

00:54:15.897 --> 00:54:18.121
LAURA: Oh!
LIAM: Mm.

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:20.950
SAM: Cowabunga.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:22.320
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to spend the rest

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.260
of my action getting to the other side

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.940
of the top of the deck and holding on.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:29.520
MATT: Okay. Holding on that side?

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.736
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:54:30.736 --> 00:54:32.019
Jester, what are you doing?

00:54:32.019 --> 00:54:34.727
LAURA: I'm going to cast

00:54:34.727 --> 00:54:36.427
Guiding Bolt!

00:54:37.577 --> 00:54:38.780
At 4th-level!

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.790
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.310
You have advantage on this attack roll

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:43.290
because of your previous Guiding Bolt.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:45.790
LAURA: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Fuck yeah!

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.080
LAURA: 28 again!

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.050
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:51.550
Go ahead and roll some damage.

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:00.799
LAURA: Ooh!

00:55:00.799 --> 00:55:02.650
SAM: Oh no, that ring on the turtle's back,

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:06.130
is that, like, a six-pack soda can ring

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.760
that someone didn't snip before they threw away?

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.886
MARISHA: Oh no!

00:55:10.886 --> 00:55:13.070
(laughter)

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:15.030
TALIESIN: Protect the oceans, you guys, come on.

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:17.500
MATT: Our ecology message comes through in our battles.

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.691
LAURA: 26.
MATT: 26 points of radiant damage, nice.

00:55:21.691 --> 00:55:23.510
So even though it's vanished below,

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.850
the second blast smashes into it,

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:28.350
from your divine pink radiant energy,

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:30.840
as it blasts a second time beneath the surface.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.420
The glow is maintained.

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.480
TRAVIS: Yes!
LAURA: Yay!

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.760
SAM: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Yes!

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.110
MATT: All righty.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:37.360
SAM: Pink power.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.868
LIAM: Throw of dust in the air, lodestone in hand.

00:55:39.868 --> 00:55:41.771
Disintegrate.

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:43.050
MATT: Disintegrate on it?
LIAM: Yeah.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:44.100
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Whoa.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.833
MATT: Go for it.

00:55:45.833 --> 00:55:48.168
SAM: He's using all the heavy spells.

00:55:48.168 --> 00:55:51.207
ASHLEY: <i>Was ist das?</i>

00:55:51.207 --> 00:55:52.879
MARISHA: <i>Was ist</i> Häagen-Dazs?

00:55:52.879 --> 00:55:55.780
SAM, ASHLEY, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: (laugh)

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.350
LIAM: 73 total.

00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:59.080
MATT: Okay, that's a dex save, right?

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.110
LIAM: Yeah, a dex save.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.844
MATT: All righty. That is--

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:05.640
18.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.560
LIAM: Beats it.

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.620
MATT: Okay, so it takes half damage.

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.560
LIAM: 35, 36, 36 or 37.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.448
MATT: 37 points of damage.

00:56:13.448 --> 00:56:15.490
So after the blast beneath the surface

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.620
of the water, (explosion) down below,

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.420
you can see this suddenly hovering Caleb,

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.750
holding on to the sail, reach over, lower his hand,

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.380
and this beam just (hisses),

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:27.630
this, like, weird, dull, green laser beam seems

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:30.020
to just emit from the finger, for but a second,

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.910
and at the surface of the water, a moment later,

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:33.270
we haven't seen impact, but at the surface of the water,

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:37.710
you see chunks of shell and brown foam, the same color

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:40.740
of the turtle, begin to rise to the surface.

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:41.720
TALIESIN: I'm a fan.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.553
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:56:42.553 --> 00:56:43.690
MATT: That finishes your turn.

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:46.020
LAURA: Do sharks start showing up because of the chum?

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:46.960
SAM: Chum in the water.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.950
ASHLEY: Nom nom nom.

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:49.200
MATT: Let me tell you,

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.720
sharks don't fuck with dragon turtles very often.

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.970
So I can't say it's--

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:53.803
LAURA: Sharks are smart, though.

00:56:53.803 --> 00:56:56.553
MATT: -- probable, but we'll see.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:58.520
That finishes your turn.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.700
LIAM: I'm going to pass.

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.533
SAM: Okay, here it comes.

00:57:00.533 --> 00:57:03.380
MATT: The dragon turtle vanishes beneath the surface.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.690
And you're not quite sure where it is.

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:05.590
Everyone loses sight of it.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:07.280
Even with your glow, you can't see it.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.280
LAURA: Oh no.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.750
MATT: And there is a calm.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:11.720
There is a quiet, where everyone just holds still,

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.589
and you hear just the waves.
ASHLEY: I brace.

00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:14.431
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:15.976
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:15.976 --> 00:57:17.129
LIAM: <i>Scheiße.</i>

00:57:17.129 --> 00:57:18.472
MATT: (explosion)

00:57:18.472 --> 00:57:21.370
The ship suddenly lurches heavily from underneath

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:24.080
as something impacts it from the very bottom of the hull.

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:28.406
The ship rises up 45 degrees into the air,

00:57:28.406 --> 00:57:31.957
(whooshes) before slamming on to the ocean there.

00:57:31.957 --> 00:57:34.273
LAURA: Oh no!
MATT: What's the AC of the ship?

00:57:34.273 --> 00:57:38.260
TRAVIS: It is 15. The hull is 15.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.940
LAURA: That's it?!
MATT: 15.

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.620
All right, 30 to hit.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.130
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.202
MATT: 27 to hit.

00:57:45.202 --> 00:57:46.170
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:47.690
MATT: And 23 to hit.

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:50.310
TRAVIS: Sure, all three of whatever just happened hit.

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:51.143
MATT: Okay.

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.870
So first, from the impact, as it bites

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:56.370
and slams from underneath--

00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:58.869
LAURA: What are we, what are--

00:57:58.869 --> 00:58:00.453
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:58:00.453 --> 00:58:02.100
ASHLEY: The ship has 500 hit points?

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.009
TRAVIS: The hull has 500 hit points.

00:58:03.009 --> 00:58:04.090
ASHLEY: The hull has 500 hit points.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:06.160
TRAVIS: The hull, the helm, the sails,

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.000
and the cannons all have different AC.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.260
LAURA: But if the hull is damaged,

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.103
everything's gone.
SAM: No, we'll still be fine.

00:58:11.103 --> 00:58:12.235
We still have the cannons.

00:58:12.235 --> 00:58:14.350
MARISHA: We can ride the cannons.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:15.884
TRAVIS: Yeah, just stick them between your legs and--

00:58:15.884 --> 00:58:16.880
(explosion)

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.500
MATT: 36 points of piercing damage from that impact.

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.333
LIAM: Okay, okay.

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.660
MATT: From its two claws, that then rake underneath.

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:26.493
LAURA: Yeah.

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:30.670
One claw aims at the cannons, though, because--

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:34.100
MATT: 24 points of slashing damage.

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.485
MARISHA: Gah, gah, tink.

00:58:37.485 --> 00:58:38.318
LAURA: Shiny.

00:58:38.318 --> 00:58:39.723
MATT: Ooh, that's not good.

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.020
30 points of slashing damage.

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.570
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:50.293
SAM: We're fine. It's 90 points. We're fine.

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:52.710
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're at 410.

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:54.890
MATT: So the ship slams back

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:57.150
on to the ocean, and you hear the (squeaks)

00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:59.780
creaking sound of elements of the hull

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.680
where the impact was just shifting.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.600
But it is now right alongside the back

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.980
and is riding the rudder.

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.280
TRAVIS: Dammit.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.240
LAURA: Just holding on?

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.620
TRAVIS: I'm glad I got everybody up, then.

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:16.890
So if you have any ranged shit, go to town.

00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:19.410
MATT: And it's going to use the last bit of its movement

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.580
to begin to submerge once more.

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:23.080
It only gets about 10 feet, though.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.560
TRAVIS: Okay, Guiding Bolt's still giving a little--

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.280
MATT: Yep, it still has its shimmer.

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.360
But it is visible primarily from the very back of the ship,

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.310
so you guys would have to--

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:33.143
SAM: Get over there.
MATT: You can't,

00:59:33.143 --> 00:59:34.690
don't really have-- oh god, Caduceus, why?

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:35.523
TALIESIN: Oh no!

00:59:35.523 --> 00:59:36.612
Long legs.

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.470
MATT: In order to see it, you would have to be

00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:42.000
towards the back of the ship

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.850
or on the very, very edges, peering off to the side.

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:46.070
It is wide enough where you can see it

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.220
from the very, very sides.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.540
SAM: Oh boy.
TRAVIS: (reading) "Move up to the speed

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:54.540
"of one of its moving components, with one 90-degree turn."

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.630
So for the first action of the ship,

00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:00.058
we're going to turn 90 degrees port.

01:00:02.026 --> 01:00:02.859
LAURA: I don't envy--

01:00:02.859 --> 01:00:05.340
MATT: Okay, 90 degrees port side.
LAURA: -- being the captain.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.173
TRAVIS: We're going to try and bring

01:00:06.173 --> 01:00:08.890
that port-side cannon back into range.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:09.723
MATT: Okay.

01:00:09.723 --> 01:00:10.556
LIAM: We're just the wild cards.

01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:11.720
MATT: That'll put it about there.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.160
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: (nervous noise)

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:13.993
LIAM: Oh jeez.

01:00:13.993 --> 01:00:15.070
TRAVIS: And we only have one cannon to fire,

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:18.810
so, everybody, get ready and fucking Get Some.

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:20.230
MARISHA: All right.

01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:22.710
TRAVIS: No, that's the command, to Get Some.

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:25.645
MARISHA: Oh, oh, fucking Get Some!

01:00:25.645 --> 01:00:27.100
Fucking fire!

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.360
SAM: But I think we loaded the starboard cannons.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.010
MARISHA: No, the port, the port.

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:33.260
MARISHA: Port, assholes!

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.880
MATT: No, the port quarter, yeah, yeah.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.770
You guys are on top, but there is one cannon, down below,

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:37.760
that can be fired.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.390
MARISHA: Not you, you're useless, Veth.

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:40.223
Gallan, go!

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.250
MATT: All right, so they go ahead and load it up,

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.400
aim (explosion), fire towards it.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.900
TRAVIS: Do you want to roll for the cannon?

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:48.733
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Right in the mouth!

01:00:48.733 --> 01:00:50.116
Right into the mouth.
MARISHA: What do I do?

01:00:50.116 --> 01:00:51.090
LAURA: Natural 20.

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:52.530
MATT: Because it is 10 feet beneath the surface,

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:53.650
it has disadvantage on the attack,

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.160
but thanks to your Guiding Bolt, it has advantage,

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.770
so it's just a singular roll plus six.

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:58.800
MARISHA: Plus six.

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:03.784
Oh, ew, 12, total, I rolled a six.

01:01:03.784 --> 01:01:05.740
MATT: (splashing) Into the water,

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.900
no impact, unfortunately.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.550
MARISHA: Fucking Gallan!

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:11.210
SAM: He's the worst.
MARISHA: God, you suck!

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.667
MATT: "I'm trying!"

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:14.390
MARISHA: Marius, I haven't forgotten about you.

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:17.200
MATT: "I'm-- jeez!"

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.400
The crew's getting very stressed.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.760
TRAVIS: That's all the ship's actions.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.890
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: The turn and the fire.

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:23.790
MATT: You got it.

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:25.050
All right, the rest of you.

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:27.660
TALIESIN: I'm going to get within 30 feet, if I can.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.770
MATT: Yeah, you are within 30 feet.

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:29.990
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bane.

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.180
MATT: Well, actually, you have to get a little close--

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.843
TALIESIN: I'll get a little closer,

01:01:32.843 --> 01:01:34.970
cast Bane, and then I'm going to back up,

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:36.680
underneath the stairs for cover.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.810
MATT: You got it, Bane?

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.110
TALIESIN: Bane.

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:40.540
SAM: ♪ Bane! ♪

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.000
MATT: All right, and you're going to back up to the stairs

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.170
for cover.
TRAVIS: ♪ Bane ♪

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:45.410
♪ I'm going to live forever ♪
TALIESIN: Like, behind the stairs,

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.430
going up.
MATT: Oh, like here?

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:48.780
TALIESIN: Yeah, like over there.
MATT: You can get about there.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.613
That's about as far as you can

01:01:49.613 --> 01:01:50.516
get with your movement.
ASHLEY: Give it to me.

01:01:50.516 --> 01:01:51.467
MATT: All right.
LIAM: (like Bane) Am I within 30 feet?

01:01:51.467 --> 01:01:53.120
MATT: Caduceus, that's your turn?

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.780
TALIESIN: Did Bane work?

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:55.613
MATT: Is it a save?

01:01:55.613 --> 01:01:57.950
TALIESIN: A charisma save.
MATT: Charisma save.

01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:58.835
TRAVIS: Look at that fucking mini.
ASHLEY: (like Bane) Would anybody

01:01:58.835 --> 01:02:00.937
like a sandwich?
TRAVIS: I mean, look at the mini.

01:02:00.937 --> 01:02:02.973
MARISHA: (laughs)
ASHLEY: I can't do it.

01:02:02.973 --> 01:02:04.401
MATT: I'm not exaggerating, natural 20.

01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:06.278
TRAVIS: Wow!
MATT: It only had a plus one.

01:02:06.278 --> 01:02:07.470
SAM: ♪ Bane! ♪
MATT: But it rolled a natural 20.

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:09.480
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: So Bane does not work.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.910
TRAVIS: He's been saving them up, for the last three months.

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:13.420
MATT: Apparently, we'll see how long it lasts.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.114
LIAM: (like Bane) This is bullshit.

01:02:15.114 --> 01:02:16.110
MATT: I've been rolling okay.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.990
It has a lot of bonuses to a lot of stuff.

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.920
MARISHA: But your hair looks great.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.950
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: Your hair does look great.

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:21.750
TRAVIS: Can I also assume that, because I'm on the helm,

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:22.680
I don't have an action?

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.070
I have to complete the turn?

01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:25.760
MATT: Yes, like, you can, if you want to--

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.990
somebody else has to take the helm, in order,

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:28.715
but for you, you're taking the actions of the ship

01:02:28.715 --> 01:02:30.003
to allow it to do its own things.

01:02:30.003 --> 01:02:33.016
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast can just
sit out for a fucking second.

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:34.120
LIAM: I got something.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.520
So Caleb is flying by the-- holding on to the sail.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.710
I'm going to get to some ropes and just get my arm wrapped

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:43.445
around in it and cast Polymorph on the turtle.

01:02:43.445 --> 01:02:45.690
TRAVIS: Oh, oh!
MATT: Okay.

01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:47.000
TRAVIS: Big swings, big swings.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.570
SAM: Are you going to turn it into a turtle?

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:50.240
TALIESIN: I wish I'd had that Bane up.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.500
TRAVIS: That would be really great.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.070
MATT: What's the DC on that?

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:53.970
LIAM: It's 17.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.460
MATT: 17, and what save is it?

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.340
LIAM: It's a wisdom save.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.340
MATT: A wisdom save.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.070
TRAVIS: Just maybe no giant turtles that are sentient.

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.100
MATT: 17!

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.690
LIAM: Oh!

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.430
And now I'm hanging from a rope.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:04.620
TALIESIN: Ah, if Bane had worked, oh!

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.840
LIAM: Because that is a concentration spell

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.015
for concentration spell.

01:03:07.015 --> 01:03:08.090
MATT: Oh yeah, all right.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:09.980
And from that, you're no longer flying, but you are now--

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.813
LIAM: Hanging.

01:03:10.813 --> 01:03:13.180
MATT: Kind of the worst Errol Flynn impression

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.030
that anyone's ever done.

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:16.070
SAM: Oh no, Caleb!

01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:17.960
TRAVIS: You look like you've done that for years.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.560
LAURA: Planning on doing the exact same thing.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.190
I'm going to cast Polymorph, as well.

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:22.290
MATT: Okay.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.670
LIAM: My arms are really not very strong.

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:30.632
MATT: That is going to be a 15.

01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:31.465
LAURA: (gasps)

01:03:31.465 --> 01:03:33.680
(cheering)

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:34.513
MARISHA: What does it do?

01:03:34.513 --> 01:03:35.960
What, what does it do?
SAM: Wait.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.900
Does that end the fight?

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.050
TRAVIS: No, I don't, no, it depends.

01:03:40.881 --> 01:03:43.081
LIAM: It depends on what she says next (laughs).

01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.250
TRAVIS: You thought about that part, right?

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:46.750
LAURA: No.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:48.394
I didn't get that far ahead!

01:03:48.394 --> 01:03:51.010
MATT: So you cast Polymorph.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:54.930
I'm going to turn him into just a regular sea turtle.

01:03:59.010 --> 01:03:59.843
MATT: Okay.

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:05.550
You watch as the shimmering energy

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:09.380
encircles its body beneath the waves,

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.290
and suddenly, it goes dark.

01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:12.123
You can't even see it.

01:04:12.123 --> 01:04:14.230
Like, it just disappeared beneath the surface

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.380
That's all you know.

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:19.790
TRAVIS: Jester, what'd you do?

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:21.590
LAURA: I turned him into a sea turtle!

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:22.630
TRAVIS: Like a regular sea turtle?

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.280
LAURA: Like a regular sea turtle, they can swim.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.820
TRAVIS: And mind you, Fjord, like,
your heart's in your chest.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.040
You have bad previous experience with turtles, in general,

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.455
especially big ones.

01:04:30.455 --> 01:04:33.041
TRAVIS: It's canon.
MATT: Yeah, it's just really, you're like--

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:33.930
(panting)

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:35.010
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, think about it,

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.630
what kind of a face does this inspire?

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:38.920
Bah, bah, bah. Terror!

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.120
LIAM: Jester has just bought us some time,

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.130
and I think that we should use it.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.650
LAURA: We should maybe go, go?

01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:46.530
We should just--
MARISHA: Go, go, go, go,

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:47.902
go, go, go!
TALIESIN: Yeah, full speed.

01:04:47.902 --> 01:04:50.361
TRAVIS: It's not our turn.
MATT: No.

01:04:50.361 --> 01:04:51.993
SAM: Sea turtles probably can swim pretty fast, I think.

01:04:51.993 --> 01:04:53.190
MATT: Veth, what are you doing?

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.023
SAM: Oh, I get a turn? Okay.

01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:58.120
I'll cast Spider Climb on myself

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.610
and march up that middle mast.

01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:01.810
MATT: All righty.

01:05:02.927 --> 01:05:04.580
So you cast that, and you get about,

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.243
your speed is what, 35, 40? What is it?

01:05:07.243 --> 01:05:08.741
SAM: No, no, it's only 30 now.

01:05:08.741 --> 01:05:11.360
I'm a halfling.
MATT: That's right. You're a halfling again.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.785
You get about 30 feet up to there, we'll say, about,

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:19.963
partway up the mast.

01:05:19.963 --> 01:05:24.100
SAM: And for my bonus action, I will--

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.510
oh, I can't cast another spell, never mind.

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:29.085
Never mind.
MATT: Never mind?

01:05:29.085 --> 01:05:31.603

01:06:53.895 --> 01:06:55.360
SAM: Did you multiclass into bard?

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.980
TALIESIN: I did.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.210
TRAVIS: You did?
TALIESIN: You know where I've been.

01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:59.980
It's been weird.
MATT: Yeah, you're a willing creature,

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.240
so sure.
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm giving myself

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.990
inspiration for this.

01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:05.800
That's pretty good.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.660
That's 18.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.360
MATT: 18, okay.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.501
You do see, below the water,

01:07:12.501 --> 01:07:14.920
probably about 35 or so feet,

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.080
there is a sea turtle, about six feet across,

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.540
from side to side, the shape of it below.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.090
So the Polymorph did succeed.

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:25.510
TALIESIN: We're good. I'm taller than he is. Let's run.

01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:26.890
TRAVIS: All right, all hands,

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:29.440
you get those barnacles up from below decks,

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.570
and we go full speed ahead!

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:36.428
MARISHA: Get your flig-flappy legs up

01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:40.086
and your sea legs are--

01:07:40.086 --> 01:07:41.250
go full speed ahead!

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:43.946
TRAVIS: Seagulls, crab, any kind of sea terminology works.

01:07:43.946 --> 01:07:45.380
LIAM: ♪ Welcome back ♪

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.560
MARISHA: I want you, Willem Dafoe

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.410
in the lighthouse, and arrgh!
LAURA: We're losing time!

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:53.190
MARISHA: Eat my lobster, and argh!

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:54.552
ASHLEY: Flappy legs.

01:07:54.552 --> 01:07:57.100
TRAVIS: Flappy legs.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.727
ASHLEY: You hear that all the time at sea.

01:07:58.727 --> 01:08:01.990
TRAVIS: Can we also make sure that
Orly puts the wind at our back?

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:03.960
I don't care which direction we're going.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.730
I just want full sail with full wind behind us.

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:07.830
SAM: What's our speed?

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:10.140
TRAVIS: 50, if the wind's behind us.

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:11.910
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: No way.

01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:14.570
MATT: So you guys correct yourselves.

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:15.403
LAURA: It's going to catch up to us.

01:08:15.403 --> 01:08:17.020
MATT: The tension remains.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.860
And you adjust the sails, go back on the course

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:21.850
where you were previously,

01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:23.010
or are you staying on the--

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:23.843
TRAVIS: Just with the wind.

01:08:23.843 --> 01:08:24.912
I don't care where it fucking takes us.

01:08:24.912 --> 01:08:26.040
MATT: Okay, it will take you further north.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.560
It might make your overall journey a little longer,

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.192
but you continue course.

01:08:33.746 --> 01:08:34.788
A little bit of time passes.

01:08:34.788 --> 01:08:35.621
TRAVIS: No.

01:08:35.621 --> 01:08:36.910
MATT: You can hear the creaking of the ship.

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.178
TRAVIS: It's an hour, man.

01:08:38.178 --> 01:08:39.249
MATT: (creaking)

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:40.702
LAURA: Is the turtle keeping up with us?

01:08:40.702 --> 01:08:41.535
Can we look and see if it's still--

01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:42.630
TRAVIS: I'm going to keep an eye for that.

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:45.170
MATT: Make another perception check.

01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:46.730
TALIESIN: Making another perception check.

01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:47.563
TRAVIS: Could we have tried

01:08:47.563 --> 01:08:48.980
to, like, banish the sea turtle or something?

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.410
LAURA: I can't see it at all.

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:51.410
SAM: We have an hour to figure it out.

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:52.610
LAURA: We have an hour, yeah.

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:55.080
TALIESIN: 18, 27.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.088
MATT: 27.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.920
You glance over and peer down below,

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.753
and it's hard to see,

01:09:00.753 --> 01:09:02.230
because you're not only just looking down into the ocean.

01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:03.460
You're looking in the wake of the ship,

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:04.820
and so above the break,

01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:08.230
and the ocean itself is obscuring your vision.

01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:09.080
With that perception check, though,

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.470
you do catch what you think is a glimmer

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:13.800
of a shadow in the water, deep below,

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.700
that is keeping pace with the ship.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.658
TALIESIN: We have a--
MARISHA: He's stalking us.

01:09:17.658 --> 01:09:20.260
TALIESIN: We have a turtle still stalking us.

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.200
LAURA: So-- that's a good idea.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.737
We can Banish him!

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:26.640
TALIESIN: I don't know how to do that.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.280
LAURA: I do, I do! But I have to be able to see him.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.339
SAM: What's the range?

01:09:30.339 --> 01:09:31.430
LAURA: Let me look.

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:33.240
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, Polymorph, you actually have

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.860
to do damage to something to change it back, right?

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.693
ASHLEY: We could swim down there.

01:09:37.693 --> 01:09:38.526
MATT: Correct.

01:09:38.526 --> 01:09:39.580
LIAM: Or run the clock out.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:40.990
MATT: Or run the clock out.

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:43.330
TRAVIS: Is the turtle's speed 50 fucking feet?

01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:44.270
MATT: Yep.

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:46.675
TRAVIS: Oh god, they're so fast!

01:09:46.675 --> 01:09:48.150
I thought they were slow.

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:49.510
MATT: It's actually faster in this form

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:50.343
than it is dragon turtle form.

01:09:50.343 --> 01:09:51.365
LAURA: Oh!

01:09:51.365 --> 01:09:53.880
(laughter)

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.452
SAM: Never polymorph anything into a turtle ever.

01:09:57.452 --> 01:09:59.148
TRAVIS: Fucking turtles!

01:09:59.148 --> 01:10:02.020
What if you picked, like, a clown fish or something?

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:02.880
That'd been better.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.210
LAURA: That would've been way better, yes.

01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:07.270
LIAM: I was going to do seahorse.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.930
LAURA: That's smarter than a sea turtle,

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:10.450
but I saw a turtle, you know.

01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:13.250
I was just going with a turtle motif.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:14.630
SAM: How close do you have to be for Banish?

01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:15.463
LAURA: 60 feet!

01:10:15.463 --> 01:10:17.080
SAM: So here's my idea.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.550
We wrap a rope around you,

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:21.000
and we sort of throw you over the ship

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.820
and sort of trail you behind us--

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.653
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Awesome.

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:25.669
SAM: Right?
LAURA: How long has it been?

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:27.490
MATT: How long has it been right now?
LAURA: When we're realizing all this.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.930
MATT: I say it's probably been about 15 minutes

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:31.590
of you guys quietly looking and keeping tabs on this

01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:34.250
and waiting, before Caduceus manages to,

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:36.120
after a while of looking down below the ship

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.540
and looking through the surf

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.460
to actually get a bead on the creature.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.640
MARISHA: We can still breathe underwater, yeah?

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.270
TALIESIN: How far away is the turtle from us?

01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:46.920
MATT: It's about 35, 40 feet below the water,

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.860
but it just, last you saw,

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:50.800
it's right at the cusp, if not below the ship.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.633
So you're not sure.

01:10:51.633 --> 01:10:53.260
LAURA: I don't think I should do Banishment.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.350
MARISHA: What do you need to do?

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:57.900
LAURA: I shouldn't, because it's also a concentration spell,

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.370
and it only lasts for a minute.

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:01.407
So it would not be as good.

01:11:01.407 --> 01:11:02.860
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought it was an hour.

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.360
LAURA: Nope, not Banishment.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.510
LIAM: Jester, Jester, let's just both go together,

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:08.250
and we both try to change it into something

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:09.400
like a seahorse, yeah?
LAURA: More Polymorph,

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.390
okay, okay, okay.
LIAM: Two chances.

01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:14.490
LAURA: To be, too, we'll cast, make him a heavy--

01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:15.530
SAM: Do we have a dinghy?

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:16.850
LAURA: -- slow--
MATT: A dinghy?

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:18.550
LAURA: -- sea creature.
SAM: A small boat?

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:19.390
MATT: Yes, yes.
LIAM: A sea slug,

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:20.950
a seahorse, something--
MATT: Technically--

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:22.340
LAURA: Slow.
LIAM: Yeah, a sea slug.

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.173
TRAVIS: A rowboat?

01:11:23.173 --> 01:11:24.006
LAURA: Sea slug.
LIAM: Sure.

01:11:24.006 --> 01:11:25.960
MATT: Less of a dinghy, more of a rowboat, or--

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.980
SAM: You know what, forget the rowboat.

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.080
TALIESIN: We can all walk on water right now.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.240
SAM: Oh, that's true.
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.190
We jump over the side

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:32.480
and walk above it.
TALIESIN: Grab the ropes.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.600
SAM: But you know what, before you go, just for flair,

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.650
I'm going to just attach two planks to your feet.

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:37.483
MARISHA: Uh-huh, skis.

01:11:37.483 --> 01:11:38.980
SAM: Yeah, and a rope.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:39.813
LAURA: Caleb can go, too.

01:11:39.813 --> 01:11:41.110
SAM: Yeah.

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:42.711
MATT: Tender, that's the phrase I was looking for.

01:11:42.711 --> 01:11:45.111
SAM: (laughs) Great.
MATT: But yes.

01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:47.370
But yes, you do have one of those.

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.680
SAM: Awesome.
MATT: So what's happening?

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.540
What are you guys doing?
LIAM: Okay, so Jester

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.373
and Caleb are going to--

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:52.800
LAURA: Can you enhance abilities, Caduceus?

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.633
TALIESIN: I can.

01:11:53.633 --> 01:11:54.466
I'm going to--
LAURA: No, wait,

01:11:54.466 --> 01:11:56.220
that doesn't matter.

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.740
TALIESIN: No, I was going to say if Bless will help--

01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:58.830
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: But I don't think it will,

01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:00.450
will it?

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:01.630
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: That's attack and saves.

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:02.680
LAURA: No, it won't.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.340
TALIESIN: If I get Bane before we do it.

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.465
I can try Bane again, but we've got to be 30 feet.

01:12:11.537 --> 01:12:12.370
MATT: What are you guys doing?
ASHLEY: We can still breathe

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.450
underwater, right?
SAM: Yeah.

01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:14.400
MATT: Everyone can breathe underwater, and--

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.790
SAM: Do you want to go down and kill it?

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:17.150
LAURA: No, no, you hit it--
MATT: -- and walk on water,

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:17.983
at the moment.

01:12:17.983 --> 01:12:20.020
You still have another, like, 40 minutes

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:20.853
of walking on water.

01:12:20.853 --> 01:12:23.360
TALIESIN: So I'm going to join you and Caleb,

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.193
back down there.
LAURA: Okay, the three of us

01:12:24.193 --> 01:12:26.650
will go out, on the water.
TALIESIN: Okay, holding ropes.

01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.920
LIAM: You keep your spell up.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.270
I will go first to try to challenge the turtle's wisdom.

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:33.600
MATT: You guys are all just water skiing behind the boat?

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.570
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:35.750
TALIESIN: Although, if I hit--
LAURA: One arm.

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:37.170
TALIESIN: -- a d4 disadvantage on that.

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:38.710
LIAM: Okay, so we're going to get super close.

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:39.710
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to try.

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:41.307
TRAVIS: Just turn the boat around.

01:12:41.307 --> 01:12:42.720
LAURA: No, no, no, we got to keep--

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.970
TRAVIS: No, I mean, we could really, like, just--

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:45.439
LAURA: That's true. We could, because
we're not going to outrun it.

01:12:45.439 --> 01:12:46.843
SAM: No, no, no, just give her the water skiing.

01:12:46.843 --> 01:12:47.734
LAURA: I like skiing, though.

01:12:47.734 --> 01:12:49.074
MARISHA: Water skiing sounds great.

01:12:49.074 --> 01:12:49.907
Okay, so--

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:50.740
LAURA: It looks cooler.

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.860
MARISHA: I feel like I need to help.

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:55.740
Yasha, I'll hold Jester's rope with you.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.720
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.700
MARISHA: Who is going to hold Caduceus' rope?

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.660
SAM: I feel like Yasha can hold all the ropes.

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.060
MARISHA: Let me feel useful, man.

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.120
TALIESIN: Everybody hold some ropes.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.261
Everybody hold all the ropes.

01:13:05.261 --> 01:13:08.895
LAURA: Also you can tie the ropes onto part of the ship.

01:13:08.895 --> 01:13:13.190
MARISHA: Okay, I start-- to the cleats of ship-- shirt--

01:13:13.190 --> 01:13:14.480
tying them off.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.890
LAURA: Okay, so we get within 30 feet of the turtle.

01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:19.890
MATT: You have to go beneath the surface.

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:21.870
It is about 35 to 40 feet below the surface.

01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:23.980
LAURA: Caduceus is going to go
below the surface a little bit.

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.120
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- actually,
because it will shoot me back up,

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.710
once I dive down, so I'm going to jump off the hull,

01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:34.300
tied to the rope, and use that to get myself down,

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.950
before it shoots me back up to the surface.

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:36.783
MATT: Okay.

01:13:36.783 --> 01:13:37.880
MARISHA: Do you have your life vest on

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.860
when you walk on water?

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.163
TALIESIN: It moves you 60 feet up, if you're

01:13:40.163 --> 01:13:41.910
underwater. It'll just shoot you 60 feet up

01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:42.743
'til you're on the surface.

01:13:42.743 --> 01:13:43.576
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

01:13:43.576 --> 01:13:48.170
MATT: So, all right, so Caduceus takes the rope--

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:49.865
LIAM: Yeah, like turtle exterminate.

01:13:49.865 --> 01:13:53.010
MATT: If there's any member of the Mighty Nein

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:56.280
who has shown a love for water and the open ocean

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.499
as much as Veth has experienced, it's Caduceus.

01:13:59.499 --> 01:14:00.332
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:14:00.332 --> 01:14:01.820
MATT: (laughs)

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.390
TALIESIN: Trying to expand my horizons.

01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:06.550
MARISHA: All right, Caduceus, if something goes wrong,

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:09.410
pull on the rope twice, and we'll yank you up.

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:12.330
TALIESIN: Can I speak underwater,
out of curiosity, with--

01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:14.590
can I speak underwater with this,

01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:16.020
with Breathe Underwater?

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:16.853
MATT: Yes.
TALIESIN: All right.

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:18.208
MATT: We've said that's allowed, yeah.

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:20.100
TALIESIN: All right, going for it, bang.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.520
MATT: All right, you--
LAURA: Woo!

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.950
MATT: Well, you jump.
TALIESIN: Yep!

01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:25.560
MATT: You leap, and you break the surface of the water.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.010
I need you to make another perception check,

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:29.740
because you are-- this is not
your trained vision on a creature.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.830
This is you leaping off a boat, into the surf,

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:34.390
and then trying to reengage your position

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:36.010
and trying to find it beneath the water,

01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:37.370
where it's super murky.
TALIESIN: 29!

01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:38.203
SAM: Whoa!

01:14:38.203 --> 01:14:40.944
MATT: You do manage to still see it.

01:14:40.944 --> 01:14:42.870
You still manage to see it, you motherfucker.

01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:44.560
SAM: Aqua cow!

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.530
TALIESIN: Bane!
LIAM: Manatee.

01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:47.570
MATT: All right, the save on that is--

01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:49.150
TALIESIN: Is a charisma 17.

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:50.780
MATT: Charisma 17.

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.110
No, that is a 10.

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:54.590
Bane is a success.
TALIESIN: Now I pop back up,

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.829
and I start-- I'm reeling myself back in.

01:14:56.829 --> 01:14:58.510
LAURA: Great, great.
TALIESIN: All yours!

01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:59.840
SAM: What does Bane do, what does Bane do?

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.270
TALIESIN: d4 against saves and attacks.

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:03.910
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:04.743
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: So, Caleb.

01:15:04.743 --> 01:15:08.120
LIAM: I'm going to Polymorph wisdom of the turtle.

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.411
MATT: Okay, you cannot see it.
LIAM: Oh.

01:15:09.411 --> 01:15:11.980
MATT: Make a perception check to see
if you can try and peer beneath water.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.793
LIAM: Okay, I stick my face into the water.
LAURA: But Caduceus is pointing out where it was.

01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:15.626
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I hold his belt.

01:15:15.626 --> 01:15:16.459
MATT: So you guys are all now--

01:15:16.459 --> 01:15:18.930
now the three of you, you guys follow Caduceus,

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:20.880
hit the water, splash up, and you grab the rope,

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.918
and you're skidding.

01:15:21.918 --> 01:15:24.200
TRAVIS: How's it going back there?

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.695
LAURA: This is really fun.

01:15:26.695 --> 01:15:29.580
TALIESIN: I'm trying to walk through
the water to tell them where.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.720
MATT: Okay, because this is
a lot of unique physicality,

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.840
that you are not really familiar with, necessarily,

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.770
can I have each of you guys

01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:43.430
just make a general dexterity saving throw, for me.

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:45.590
LIAM: All right.
LAURA: Sure.

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:47.990
MATT: This is your attempt to--
while you can walk on water,

01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:49.700
you're being dragged by a boat on a rope.

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.058
SAM: Ooh, while you're back there, could you do that--

01:15:52.058 --> 01:15:54.290
TRAVIS and SAM: (groaning)

01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:55.915
LIAM: What good is Walk on Water?

01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:58.820
MATT: Well, the good news is you don't sink.

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.337
But you do stone skip a bit.

01:16:00.337 --> 01:16:01.716
TRAVIS: (thumps)

01:16:01.716 --> 01:16:02.680
MATT: You haven't, like--
LIAM: That's on brand.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:03.970
MATT: You haven't let go of the rope.

01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:04.812
But you are--

01:16:04.812 --> 01:16:06.040
(crashing).
LIAM: Sure.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.810
TALIESIN: I assume we're tied to the ropes, anyway.

01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.385
LIAM: I weigh 98 pounds.
LAURA: You got water up your butt.

01:16:10.385 --> 01:16:12.676
MATT: You do take seven points of
bludgeoning damage in the process.

01:16:12.676 --> 01:16:14.784
LIAM: How many points?
MATT: Seven point of bludgeoning damage.

01:16:14.784 --> 01:16:16.810
And you are currently unable
to cast a spell this round,

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:17.643
because you cannot concentrate.

01:16:17.643 --> 01:16:18.630
LIAM: Aww!
ASHLEY: Oh no!

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:20.101
LIAM: Get it, Jester.

01:16:20.101 --> 01:16:21.190
MATT: Jester, what'd you roll?

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:22.121
LAURA: I rolled 20.

01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:24.705
SAM: Why don't you try that thing where two

01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:28.540
of you are standing up and one
of you is on their shoulders,

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.021
sort of like a pyramid thing?

01:16:31.021 --> 01:16:32.880
(laughter)

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:33.713
TRAVIS: Jaws II.

01:16:33.713 --> 01:16:35.720
LAURA: I have an important question about spells,

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.410
which I feel like I would already know.

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:38.400
MATT: Sure, what's your question?

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.410
TRAVIS: But it's been three months.

01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:43.228
LAURA: If I am doing a concentration spell,

01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:47.130
and I'm holding it, and I try to do another spell,

01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:48.100
and it doesn't succeed,

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:50.140
does the concentration still hold from the previous one?

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.398
MATT and LIAM: No.
LAURA: It drops.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:52.648
MATT: It drops.
LIAM: You're giving it up.

01:16:52.648 --> 01:16:53.910
LAURA: Okay, so here's the thing.

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:56.430
If I try to do this Polymorph
and it doesn't succeed--

01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:58.750
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:00.866
SAM: I think it's worth it.
MARISHA: It goes back to a regular dragon turtle.

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.810
SAM: I think it's worth it.
TALIESIN: No!

01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:04.140
SAM: He's got Bane on him.
LIAM: No, you're risking it.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.224
LIAM: With us in the water you're
risking it turning into Godzilla.

01:17:07.224 --> 01:17:09.020
LAURA: Then I'm going to wait.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.903
I'm going to help Caleb stand up,
so that he can do it.

01:17:10.903 --> 01:17:12.686
SAM: This is the best chance we're going to get.

01:17:12.686 --> 01:17:14.231
It's going to fade.
TRAVIS: We have an hour.

01:17:14.231 --> 01:17:15.350
LAURA: We have an hour.
LIAM: An hour!

01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:16.780
LAURA: It's only been, like, 20 minutes.

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.030
TRAVIS: We can turn the boat around.

01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:19.340
LIAM: Shut up, you anarchist!

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.010
MATT: The process of getting the ropes,

01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:22.380
making the deal, jumping over the water,

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:25.540
getting in there, surveying the territory to

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.158
actually get a visual bead on this creature,

01:17:27.158 --> 01:17:28.640
as you guys are currently attempting to,

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.690
getting Caleb from stone-skipping himself to death,

01:17:30.690 --> 01:17:32.345
in the back.
LIAM: (popping)

01:17:32.345 --> 01:17:33.950
(laughter)

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:35.699
TRAVIS: Like [inaudible].
MATT: Yeah!

01:17:35.699 --> 01:17:38.241
As you the rest of you are just kind
of watching this happen-

01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:40.193
LIAM: It is so in-character.
MATT: Yep!

01:17:40.193 --> 01:17:42.450
We're hitting about the 25, 30-minute mark.

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.460
So we're hitting near the halfway point

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:47.030
of the Polymorph.
TRAVIS: Can I shout: Lower sail!

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:50.050
And do a 180-degree turn, so we just like--

01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:52.450
LAURA: Aah!
TRAVIS: Spin it around, right? Just, like, to stop--

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:53.874
just to stop our our forward momentum.

01:17:53.874 --> 01:17:54.972
MATT: Yes, you can.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:17:54.972 --> 01:17:57.105
LAURA: But wait, we have to cast the sp-- oh god!

01:17:57.105 --> 01:18:00.422
MATT: At this point, you guys now
are being yanked with centrifugal force,

01:18:00.422 --> 01:18:02.670
as the ship begins to turn around.

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:03.990
It's not super strong, but it's enough

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:06.440
to just whip you a bit (splashes),

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.740
across the water.
TALIESIN: I'm trying to keep--

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:09.930
I'm keeping-- I'm trying to keep a--

01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:10.870
MATT: You can see it.

01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:11.830
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm, I'm--

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:13.760
MATT: He's pointing in the direction.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.910
But this is less about knowing

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:17.520
where it is and more, actually, trying

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.450
to make out the shape beneath the surface of the water.

01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:22.030
It says our travel pace is four miles an hour,

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.113
so-- (laughs)

01:18:24.207 --> 01:18:26.260
MATT: You guys aren't super fast, necessarily,

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.280
but it's the ocean.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.610
LAURA: Oh, we just turn the fan, at this point.

01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:30.902
MARISHA: We can only use it once.

01:18:30.902 --> 01:18:32.843
LAURA: Shit.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

01:18:32.843 --> 01:18:33.880
It's done.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.800
MATT: Nevertheless, what are you guys doing?

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.353
LIAM: Will you help me get me to my feet?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:38.353 --> 01:18:40.050
LIAM: I'm going to shove my face into the water again

01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:41.710
and try to see it, again.

01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:42.720
MATT: Okay, all right.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.470
We'll say, for the sake

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.720
of not just doing repeated perception checks over

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.830
and over and over and over again,

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:49.800
this takes a period of time to try and reorient yourself.

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.633
LIAM: Okay.

01:18:50.633 --> 01:18:53.010
MATT: So this'll get us to the...
just past the 30-minute mark.

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:54.530
LAURA: Oh my god.
MATT: Attempt it again.

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:56.200
LIAM: The perception check, yes?
MATT: Yeah.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.483
TRAVIS: Goddamn.
LAURA: Guidance!

01:18:57.483 --> 01:18:59.483
LIAM: 21.
MATT: 21?

01:18:59.483 --> 01:19:01.702
LAURA: Guidance, Guidance.

01:19:01.702 --> 01:19:03.644
LIAM: Is that an extra d4?
LAURA: Yes.

01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:05.420
LIAM: 22.

01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.410
MATT: You do see it beneath the surface.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:10.760
You can just barely see the shape of the sea turtle,

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.820
beneath the boat, and as the boat turns around,

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:15.250
you see it rests, and it's down below,

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.400
resting in the water,

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.345
glancing up in the direction.

01:19:18.345 --> 01:19:19.178
SAM: Oh man.

01:19:19.178 --> 01:19:22.610
LIAM: Yeah, be a sea slug, <i>bitte</i>.

01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:23.650
MATT: All right, and that is a--

01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:24.600
LIAM: 17 wisdom.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.950
MATT: 17 wisdom!
TALIESIN: With a negative d4.

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:27.640
TRAVIS: That's an actual animal, right?

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:28.473
LIAM: Yeah.

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:31.940
MATT: That is--
TALIESIN: With the d4 minus?

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:32.970
MATT: With the d4 minus.

01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:34.640
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: No worries.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.810
Sorry, what are you turning it into, you said?

01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:37.290
LIAM: 17 is--
MATT: No, what?

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:38.340
LIAM: Oh, a sea slug.

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.000
MATT: A sea slug, all righty.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.490
That brings it to a 13.

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:43.398
LAURA and SAM: (gasp)
MATT: So yeah.

01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:48.745
The shadow of the creature
becomes near impossible to see.

01:19:48.745 --> 01:19:49.745
TALIESIN: Run!

01:19:49.745 --> 01:19:51.193
MATT: You do not see it, at this time.

01:19:51.193 --> 01:19:52.476
TRAVIS: Are we good?
TALIESIN: Run!

01:19:52.476 --> 01:19:53.935
TRAVIS: Are we good?
LAURA: Run!

01:19:53.935 --> 01:19:56.003
LIAM: It's a slug! Let's go!
TRAVIS: Full sail! Full speed ahead!

01:19:56.003 --> 01:19:57.719
LAURA: Wait, we have an hour.
We have a whole other hour.

01:19:57.719 --> 01:19:59.720
TRAVIS: Throw Marius, Gallan, and Delles off!

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.192
We need all the excess weight off the ship!

01:20:02.192 --> 01:20:03.959
MARISHA: Fucking Marius!

01:20:03.959 --> 01:20:06.080
LAURA: I'm going to cast, from behind the boat,

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.710
I'm going to cast Control Water, to speed us up.

01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:10.700
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:13.318
SAM: Maybe you should polymorph it
again, into something else.

01:20:13.318 --> 01:20:14.151
LAURA: Mm-mm.
SAM: No?

01:20:14.151 --> 01:20:14.984
LAURA: Well, I can't.

01:20:14.984 --> 01:20:16.300
It's too low.

01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.070
TRAVIS: I actually will do the same, at some point.

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:20.030
I'll throw a Control Water out there,

01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:21.270
to do the same.

01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:23.880
MATT: Okay, now, sea slug--

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.060
TRAVIS: Oh god, what?

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.897
SAM: Can go 80 feet per round.

01:20:26.897 --> 01:20:28.880
(laughter)

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.040
MARISHA: And can fly.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.580
LIAM: It immediately gets eaten by a guppy.

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:33.960
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.252
MARISHA: And then breaks.

01:20:35.252 --> 01:20:37.030
TRAVIS: (gasps)

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.863
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:20:37.863 --> 01:20:41.520
MATT: No, I'm just, there is no particular stat block

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.020
for a sea slug, so I'm just having to figure it out.

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.632
It's not going to move fast.

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:49.030
It is not a free ocean speedy creature.

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:50.280
Okay.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.113
TALIESIN: Full speed.

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:52.860
MATT: So full speed, the ship picks up.

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:55.140
Are you going along with the wind,
or are you going back on your path?

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:57.290
TRAVIS: The wind at our backs, 50.

01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:59.500
MATT: Okay, okay.
TRAVIS: North.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.620
LIAM: Caleb's hands on both
of the clerics' shoulders,

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.090
just, like, tripping and slipping on the water

01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:04.650
and holding on to them to try to get back.

01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:06.580
TALIESIN: Are we already out of range of the--

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:08.753
I can't even see the sea slug.
I don't know why I bother.

01:21:08.753 --> 01:21:10.020
MATT: Yeah, the sea slug is--
TALIESIN: Gone, all right.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.020
MATT: That's a whole nother perception check,

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.723
if you want to try and make it.
TALIESIN: No, no, I'm cool.

01:21:12.723 --> 01:21:15.210
MATT: Okay, so as the boat now picks up,

01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:17.550
you guys are still on the back, on the ropes,

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:19.050
as it turns back into the wind

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:20.330
and then (whooshes) picks up full speed,

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:21.770
as people are shouting above.

01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:23.050
The crew is scattering about.

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:25.000
They're pulling the sails fully open.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.720
And the three of you are now still like (shushes).

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.330
TALIESIN: We were supposed to be getting pulled in,

01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:30.990
for this whole--
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm pulling him in.

01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.823
I'm pulling him in.
MATT: All right.

01:21:31.823 --> 01:21:33.623
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! I forgot about you guys! (laughs)

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:36.860
MATT: Yeah, I was wondering when
that was going to happen. (laughs)

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:40.322
So, eventually, you pull them back up, on to the ship.

01:21:40.322 --> 01:21:41.480
LAURA: I tried to do some cool tricks.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.710
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)
TRAVIS: Sorry, sorry.

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:45.920
MATT: But you continue to go for a while,

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.950
a little bit off course,

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:49.560
so probably out about a day or so,

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.020
or a half a day of travel, I'd say,

01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:53.490
once you correct.

01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:55.742
But you continue, up until sunset.

01:21:57.350 --> 01:22:00.048
And at what point do you want to correct,

01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:03.260
at this point or in the morning?

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.100
TRAVIS: Has it been an hour, a couple of hours?

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:06.430
MATT: It's been more than a few hours, yeah.

01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:07.263
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: About three hours.

01:22:07.263 --> 01:22:09.130
TRAVIS: Any land in sight?

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:11.300
MATT: From this point, no.

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.300
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.900
I mean, anybody see any fucking swimming islands?

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.100
TALIESIN: I'm keeping my eyes peeled.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.720
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.630
All right, good to know.
LAURA: Oh god!

01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:24.441
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:22:24.441 --> 01:22:25.570
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:26.480
Natural one.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.110
MARISHA: Oh boy. Oh no.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.732
MATT: It seems fine.
LIAM: That's impossible!

01:22:29.732 --> 01:22:30.652
TALIESIN: I think I'm a little shook.

01:22:30.652 --> 01:22:34.077
There's chlorine in my eyes.
TRAVIS: So we came around the bottom of Urukayxl,

01:22:34.077 --> 01:22:35.622
and now we're going like this, right?

01:22:35.622 --> 01:22:38.630
SAM: Sea chlorine.
MATT: Well, you're just past

01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:42.050
the Inkclaw Reefs, and you're heading northwest,

01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:44.940
and so you're just passing the tip of the Inkclaw Reef.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.220
TRAVIS: Up here?

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.828
MATT: No, right there, on that corner there.

01:22:50.317 --> 01:22:52.850
The weather's good, right now, which is nice.

01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:55.140
TRAVIS: We were heading west, right,
so we were coming this direction?

01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:55.973
MATT: Correct.

01:22:55.973 --> 01:22:57.230
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's--

01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:59.320
MATT: So yeah, you're loosely heading now

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.420
in the direction of Rumblecusp.

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.810
You're a little bit off.

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.640
But you say you're probably about,

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.545
you're guessing four days of travel.

01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:06.645
TRAVIS: Well, I would assume

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.240
that if we headed in the direction that we were moving

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.460
when the dragon turtle started tracking us,

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.270
that it would search for us in that direction.

01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:18.200
So I think we add time and keep going

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:19.640
with the wind at our back, north,

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.960
and just add time to the--

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:21.880
TALIESIN: Especially if there's somewhere

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.320
where we can repair the ship.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.400
TRAVIS: Well, we're out in the middle of fucking nowhere.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.710
Rumblecusp is the closest thing.

01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:30.210
We're kind of down here.

01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:33.880
So it's Rumblecusp or the bottom part of Nicodranas,

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.230
or whatever this is.
LAURA: We can't miss Traveler Con.

01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:38.070
TRAVIS: It's a week.

01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:39.390
I mean, it might add a day or two,

01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:41.550
but I think we'll still be okay.

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:44.510
I think we keep going north for at least another,

01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:49.000
let's call it, half a day and keep an eye out,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.490
and if nothing shows, then we can start to course correct,

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:53.650
back west.
MATT: Okay, got it, cool.

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:55.470
So you guys continue northward,

01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:57.550
for the remainder of the day, into the night,

01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:00.830
no sight of the creature.

01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:02.210
SAM: Great.

01:24:02.210 --> 01:24:04.850
MATT: Evening's rest comes, the next day,

01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:06.400
three days of travel away from Rumblecusp.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.480
TRAVIS: Re-up Underwater Breathing at 2:30.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.313
MATT: You got it.

01:24:09.313 --> 01:24:10.670
TRAVIS: I will also pray to the Wild Mother

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:12.440
and say: I'm sorry I didn't check in

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.818
before I got on the water, like a fucking noob!

01:24:14.818 --> 01:24:16.180
MATT: (laughs)

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.677
TRAVIS: Please watch over the cast. The crew.

01:24:18.677 --> 01:24:21.060
(laughter)

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.270
LIAM: Both, both, both!

01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:23.480
MATT: You got it.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.755
You got it.

01:24:24.755 --> 01:24:25.790
TRAVIS: Yeah, both.

01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:27.973
MATT: All righty.

01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:31.050
MARISHA: That's such a Freudian slip.

01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:32.550
Oh no.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:35.450
MATT: The next day of travel, you are now correcting course?

01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:36.283
Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:24:36.283 --> 01:24:37.510
MATT: Then you now head straight.

01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:38.810
It's a little bit of a deviation.

01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:39.750
It's not terribly off.

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:42.310
You weren't wildly going in the opposite direction.

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:44.980
But you head back true, towards Rumblecusp.

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:47.100
With Orly's help, easy enough to figure out

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.520
where you were and where you're going.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.430
Continuing through that day--

01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:53.200
TRAVIS: Would you say about 12 hours have passed,

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.327
with us on a deviated course?

01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:57.950
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:24:57.950 --> 01:25:00.220
MATT: So you lost about six hours of travel, I'd say,

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.590
so a little under half a day.

01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:02.960
ASHLEY: That's terrible.
MATT: Not too bad.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.793
TRAVIS: No, I'm just trying

01:25:03.793 --> 01:25:06.150
to go the opposite direction we were going.

01:25:06.150 --> 01:25:07.510
MATT: Yeah.

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:09.270
Yeah, you'll still get there with days to spare.

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.103
LIAM: Yeah.

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:14.119
MATT: Next day, seems uneventful.

01:25:14.119 --> 01:25:15.250
SAM: Okay.

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:16.420
MATT: If you're keeping watch again, Caduceus,

01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:18.100
make a perception check for me.

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.900
TALIESIN: Let's do a little better than last time.

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.050
TRAVIS: Oh--

01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:21.883
LIAM: Long rest.

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:24.400
TALIESIN: Eh, it's okay.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.680
18.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.950
MATT: 18, okay.

01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:27.783
No sign.

01:25:27.783 --> 01:25:31.930
TRAVIS: First Mate, will you take some crew

01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:33.830
and check for any damage to the ship

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:34.960
from when we got rammed?

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.870
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.
TRAVIS: We probably should've done that already.

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:38.070
MARISHA: All right.

01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:41.310
Marius, Shelda, Gallan, come on,

01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:42.870
we're going below deck.

01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:43.703
Who was the carpenter?

01:25:43.703 --> 01:25:45.700
Jester, you're a carpenter, right?
LAURA: I'm a carpenter,

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:50.039
and also there's another dude who is Gallan,

01:25:50.039 --> 01:25:50.970
is a carpenter.
MARISHA: Gallan, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:52.030
TRAVIS: Old Axe-Head.

01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:54.177
MATT: Both you and Gallan together.

01:25:54.177 --> 01:25:55.010
TRAVIS: (axe impact)

01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.843
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

01:25:55.843 --> 01:25:58.460
So you and Gallan, together, both are the most trained

01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:59.490
and skilled for this particular task.

01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:01.000
LAURA: We're very trained and skilled.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
MATT: So you take some supplies,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.370
and the two of you can take the better part of the day

01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:05.350
to work on some of the hull damage below.

01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:07.200
It's not too bad, thankfully.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.260
It was a heavy hit,

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.620
and you would've started seeing serious penalties

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.950
to everything, probably with the next round of attacks.

01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:16.990
TRAVIS: Is there a way to regain hit points for the hull?

01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.930
MATT: That's what we're doing right now.

01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:19.880
So I need for you and Gallan,

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.482
go ahead and roll 2d12, for me.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.513
LAURA: Each?

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:26.346
MATT: No, together.

01:26:26.346 --> 01:26:27.670
Just one d12 for each of you.

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:31.653
LAURA: Eight.

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:33.450
MATT: So you repair eight points to the hull.

01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:34.780
SAM: Oh, okay!
LAURA: Oh, eight whole points.

01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:35.890
TRAVIS: Eight points, okay.

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:36.960
MATT: Hey, everything helps.

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.290
MATT: It's two people at sea, with
whatever materials you have

01:26:40.290 --> 01:26:41.540
and a couple of tools, fixing a ship

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:44.140
from the inside.
LAURA: What about with my Mending spell, though?

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:46.410
MATT: It's a bit much for a Mending spell, unfortunately.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:47.770
LAURA: Shit, I keep trying it, every time.

01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:49.490
MATT: I know.
SAM: You could paint a new hull.

01:26:50.490 --> 01:26:52.120
LAURA: No, we tried this before.

01:26:53.153 --> 01:26:56.160
It just would be a plank of wood that would fall down.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:56.993
MATT: Yeah.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:58.970
All right, so--

01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:00.530
SAM: Sounds fun.

01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:03.900
MATT: This day seems to close, uneventfully.

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:07.610
Go through the night, on to the second-to-last day

01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:10.550
before your approach to Rumblecusp.

01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:15.530
TRAVIS: Can I ask Caduceus to try and-- (sighs).

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:18.410
You might know this better than I.

01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:20.960
Does the Wild Mother have any sort of, I don't know,

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.590
early warning system for incoming dragon turtles,

01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:27.370
anything in her oceans?

01:27:27.370 --> 01:27:28.310
TALIESIN: I mean--

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:31.270
TRAVIS: She could give us a
stiff breeze, a fart on the wind.

01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:32.103
I don't know.

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:37.390
TALIESIN: I suppose I can make an attempt.

01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:40.657
So I'm going to try--

01:27:41.963 --> 01:27:44.463
where is it-- Divine Intervention.

01:27:44.463 --> 01:27:45.296
MATT: Sure.

01:27:45.296 --> 01:27:48.938
TALIESIN: To see if I can store up

01:27:48.938 --> 01:27:52.350
some safe passage for us once we get there.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:55.620
TRAVIS: Or maybe even any knowledge about a dragon turtle,

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:58.440
since no one knows anything, right?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.090
MATT: That would be less Divine Intervention.

01:28:00.090 --> 01:28:02.570
That'd be more of a Commune.

01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:04.250
TALIESIN: I don't have Commune loaded up.

01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:05.940
MATT: Okay, so you have to wait for the next day to do that.

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:06.900
But for Divine Intervention,

01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.842
you are trying to assure safer passage?

01:28:08.842 --> 01:28:09.675
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.380
SAM: Yasha fell off the boat.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.213
TALIESIN: 21.

01:28:14.213 --> 01:28:15.046
MARISHA: Meh.
MATT: 21.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:17.510
TALIESIN: Not that I can really think of,

01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:21.320
although I can do, and every now and then,

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.270
throughout the night, I'm going to cast--

01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:26.760
hold on, I haven't hit my long rest,

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.339
because I used a lot of spells--

01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:36.360
the Locate Object, which should work for turtle dragons,

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.710
within 1,000 feet.
MATT: It's not an object.

01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:39.550
TALIESIN: It's not an object, gah.
MATT: It's a creature.

01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:41.550
Sorry, buddy.
TALIESIN: Do I have Locate Creature?

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:43.200
I don't, do I?

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.033
No.

01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:47.770
Yeah, I can maybe do something tomorrow, maybe.

01:28:47.770 --> 01:28:48.603
TRAVIS: Just keep in mind.

01:28:48.603 --> 01:28:52.630
Can we also ask the crew, anyone, even the other,

01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:54.560
Marius, Gallan, Delles,

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.280
does anyone have any knowledge of dragon turtles, at all,

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.070
encounters, what they've heard, hearsay?

01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:01.360
MATT: You ask around.
TRAVIS: Knowledge?

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:04.810
MATT: Gallan goes, "If I'm going to be honest,

01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:08.130
"there was, supposedly, and this was sort of a wives' tale,

01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:10.580
"back in Darktow, but there was supposedly a dragon turtle

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:13.630
"that had an arrangement with the Revelry,

01:29:13.630 --> 01:29:15.010
"as part of the defenses, to make sure

01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:17.763
"that unapproved ships made it through the reef safely."

01:29:17.763 --> 01:29:20.210
TRAVIS: Around the island, around Darktow?

01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:21.043
MATT: "Right, right.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.570
"We're a bit far from Darktow,

01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:26.110
"so I don't think it's the same creature."

01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:27.560
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.380
MATT: "But at least, from what I know,

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.110
"there was an arrangement made."

01:29:32.110 --> 01:29:34.260
LAURA: Oh, so they're--
TRAVIS: Intelligent.

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:37.110
LAURA: They're, like, really smart and stuff.

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:39.818
And they can be bargained with.

01:29:39.818 --> 01:29:40.968
SAM: So next time we see it,

01:29:40.968 --> 01:29:42.638
we should bargain with it.

01:29:42.638 --> 01:29:46.018
LAURA: We should definitely be like, "So sorry, man."

01:29:46.018 --> 01:29:47.593
SAM: (imitating Jester) Yeah, sorry, man.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:29:47.593 --> 01:29:48.877
MARISHA: Do we have anything that

01:29:48.877 --> 01:29:51.855
we could've bargained with?
SAM: Marius.

01:29:51.855 --> 01:29:53.250
MARISHA: Ah, that's a good point.

01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:55.935
TALIESIN: Well, what do dragon turtles want?

01:29:56.830 --> 01:30:01.160
TRAVIS: Well, if the post around
Darktow is such a sweet gig,

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:06.160
maybe we would lead it to Darktow and let them fight.

01:30:06.556 --> 01:30:08.452
(laughter)

01:30:08.452 --> 01:30:09.505
TALIESIN: I love that movie.

01:30:09.505 --> 01:30:13.440
TRAVIS: Right, I mean, Darktow's got riches.

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.273
We don't.

01:30:15.146 --> 01:30:16.630
Maybe that's what it's looking for.

01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:18.730
LAURA: Maybe it just wanted a friend.

01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:20.390
Maybe it was really lonely out here.

01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:21.223
Maybe the turtle

01:30:21.223 --> 01:30:24.260
that was protecting Darktow was its mate,

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:27.190
and it just wanted help freeing the other turtle

01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:30.260
from the Darktow and then we kept it from being--

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:31.910
SAM: Oh, that's a sweet love story.

01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:32.990
LAURA: I know, it would've been really sweet.

01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:34.920
TRAVIS: Was this in one of your books or something?

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.939
LAURA: I'm just saying that's possible.

01:30:36.939 --> 01:30:37.772
TRAVIS: Huh.

01:30:37.772 --> 01:30:39.210
LIAM: I wonder if it has a dragon's hoard,

01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:41.230
somewhere beneath the waves.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:45.150
TRAVIS: Oh.
LIAM: Don't you?

01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:47.247
MARISHA: Always, yeah.

01:30:47.247 --> 01:30:49.463
That was my first thought as well.

01:30:49.463 --> 01:30:50.830
SAM: (laughs)

01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:52.663
TALIESIN: I'm officially lost.

01:30:54.363 --> 01:30:55.630
LAURA: Do you want to go look for it?

01:30:57.550 --> 01:31:00.690
LIAM: I think we have pressing matters at Rumblecup, no?

01:31:00.690 --> 01:31:01.750
LAURA: Yeah, I think you're right.

01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:03.030
LIAM: Crumblerusp?

01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.900
LAURA: Yeah.

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:05.440
TALIESIN: Rumblecrumbs.
LIAM: Fumbleschnauss.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.270
MATT: There you go. Rumpleschmutz, yeah.

01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:11.820
All right, finishing the second-to-last day,

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.960
you had spells you've prepared, you said.

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:18.090
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have to change my spells.

01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:18.923
TRAVIS: And they did repairs

01:31:18.923 --> 01:31:21.090
for this day, already?
MATT: Correct.

01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:22.710
Yeah, we're now getting into the second-to-last day here,

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.460
which you would have newer spells prepared.

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.100
You can make another perception check.

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.150
And you can attempt more repairs, if you'd like.

01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:30.733
So roll 2d12.

01:31:33.648 --> 01:31:35.700
TALIESIN: So yeah, I'll--
LAURA: 19.

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:36.970
SAM: Hey!

01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:37.803
MATT: Got it.

01:31:37.803 --> 01:31:39.286
TALIESIN: I can use Commune.

01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:42.003
MATT: Yes, you may.

01:31:42.003 --> 01:31:44.110
TALIESIN: I will, at the break of day,

01:31:45.010 --> 01:31:49.790
as the sun slowly rises... in the west.

01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:50.730
TRAVIS: Ooh.

01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:52.230
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm just--

01:31:52.230 --> 01:31:54.203
I don't actually really-- yeah.

01:31:54.203 --> 01:31:55.369
SAM: It rises in the west?

01:31:55.369 --> 01:31:57.373
TALIESIN: The sun slowly rises in the south.

01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:00.260
MATT: He's not good with directions, Caduceus.

01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:01.510
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:03.291
I've got people for that.

01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:06.960
TRAVIS: The Menagerie is pretty weird.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.093
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and begin my meditation.

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.150
We came across a dragon turtle.

01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:21.033
Are we still being pursued?

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:26.360
MATT: As you close your eyes and
envision the ocean around you,

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:31.170
serene and beautiful, you can feel the waves churning,

01:32:31.170 --> 01:32:36.170
and you can sense the waves slightly

01:32:36.927 --> 01:32:40.320
spreading like an arrowhead, in your direction,

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:43.897
which leads you to believe: probably.

01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.063
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.270
Well, that answers my--

01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:55.407
Can this creature be reasoned with?

01:32:58.270 --> 01:33:01.660
Is this creature likely to be reasoned with?

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:03.790
MATT: This piercing arrowhead, through the ocean

01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:07.170
that heads your direction, heads with purpose,

01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:11.730
and seems to have an intelligence to it.

01:33:11.730 --> 01:33:16.170
The wind that blows along with it gives you this answer

01:33:16.170 --> 01:33:19.297
that would say: likely.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.150
TALIESIN: Likely?
MATT: Likely.

01:33:22.150 --> 01:33:23.171
TALIESIN: Ah.

01:33:23.171 --> 01:33:26.620
TRAVIS: <i>Can</i> be reasoned with.

01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:35.056
SAM: Does this creature have a mate

01:33:35.056 --> 01:33:36.423
near Darktow?

01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:41.717
TALIESIN: Does this creature know where we are, right now,

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:47.960
versus where we're going, I suppose, really, right?

01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.750
MATT: Where the waves divide,

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:58.988
the direction of travel is determined.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.000
The horizon is cloudy, but it continues to push.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.032
So the answer is uncertain.

01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:12.510
TALIESIN: It's still following us.

01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:14.270
TRAVIS: Or searching.

01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:16.200
TALIESIN: No, it's following us.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:19.255
It's right behind us.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.040
MARISHA: What did we do to piss it off?

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.533
Aren't there, like, hundreds of other ships in the sea?

01:34:25.533 --> 01:34:27.825
SAM: We're pretty awesome.
LAURA: Well, we sort of attacked it.

01:34:27.825 --> 01:34:29.410
LIAM: Yeah, we kind of lit it up.

01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:31.440
Maybe it's holding a grudge.
ASHLEY: It's probably just mad.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.273
LAURA: And also we turned it

01:34:32.273 --> 01:34:35.040
into a regular turtle and then a sea slug.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.950
SAM: Also, it hasn't had sex in a long time.

01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:39.730
LAURA: Because its mate is stuck in Darktow!

01:34:39.730 --> 01:34:40.760
SAM: Its mate is in Darktow!

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.520
It's an epic love story.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.590
MARISHA: Maybe we just need to hook it up, man.

01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:46.490
Maybe he just needs to get laid.

01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:47.810
SAM: Just finger bang that thing.

01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:48.930
It'll all be okay.

01:34:48.930 --> 01:34:50.149
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:52.060
(laughter)

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:52.893
ASHLEY: Oh man.

01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:55.150
TALIESIN: And we're back, we're back.

01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:57.240
TRAVIS: Are we volunteering here?

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:01.110
SAM: Sure, man, I'll do whatever it
takes to defend my cannons.

01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:03.330
ASHLEY: You just, you know, swim down and--

01:35:05.290 --> 01:35:06.180
TALIESIN: Since it's a new day,

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:07.820
I'm going to try another Divine Intervention

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.820
to throw this thing off our trail.

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:11.040
LIAM: Oh, man.
MATT: Okay.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:14.675
TALIESIN: To confuse it and throw it in the wrong direction.

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:17.508
TRAVIS: (giggling)

01:35:20.405 --> 01:35:21.861
TALIESIN: (groans) 19.

01:35:21.861 --> 01:35:23.061
MATT: No.

01:35:23.061 --> 01:35:24.540
TALIESIN: (groans)

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:27.780
MATT: You do notice that there
is a storm passing to the west

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:32.780
that is not heading in your direction.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.680
So at the very least, while there is not an immediate hand

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.840
in the matters by the entity of your faith,

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:44.250
there is active intent to try and at least help

01:35:44.250 --> 01:35:46.358
with safe passage, in general.

01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:51.690
TALIESIN: This is kind of the way of things.

01:35:51.690 --> 01:35:52.990
We're sort of stuck in it.

01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:55.400
TRAVIS: Best see it through, then.

01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:58.140
All right?
MARISHA: Maybe if we hang out

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:02.230
on Rumblecusp for a week, he'll forget.

01:36:02.230 --> 01:36:03.990
TRAVIS: I'm not as concerned about that.

01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:06.010
I'm just trying to get us there.

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:07.310
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:09.640
LAURA: I'm going to climb up to the crow's nest.

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:10.585
MATT: Okay.

01:36:10.585 --> 01:36:13.190
LAURA: And I'm going to draw in my journal

01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:15.880
a couple of giant sea dragons,

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.290
turtle dragons humping.

01:36:19.237 --> 01:36:20.376
MATT: (squeals)

01:36:20.376 --> 01:36:22.722
(laughter)

01:36:22.722 --> 01:36:23.812
TALIESIN: Waiting for it.

01:36:23.812 --> 01:36:26.870
LIAM: (nasally moaning)

01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:28.950
MATT: All righty, there you go.

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:33.250
SAM: With these days, we've been at
sea for another two days?

01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:34.430
MATT: You've been at sea for three days,

01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:36.010
since the encounter with the sea turtle.

01:36:36.010 --> 01:36:39.130
SAM: I'm going to try to, with some black powder

01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:42.960
and maybe a hollowed-out cannonball,

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.890
I'm going to try to fashion a crude depth charge.

01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:47.680
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:48.740
MATT: Sure.

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:51.000
TRAVIS: Fluffernutter and depth charges.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.610
MARISHA: Are you going to do that on the boat?

01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:53.443
SAM: Yep!

01:36:53.443 --> 01:36:54.276
TRAVIS: Cool.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:36:54.276 --> 01:36:55.150
MARISHA: Are you going to do that

01:36:55.150 --> 01:36:56.880
by the rest of the powder?

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.630
SAM: No, that would be crazy.

01:36:58.630 --> 01:36:59.970
MARISHA: Our boat's made of wood.

01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:04.970
MATT: Yeah, well, as a note, most cannonballs? Not hollow,

01:37:05.303 --> 01:37:06.440
so you have to hollow one out.

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.550
SAM: Maybe I'll just find a cask then, a cask.

01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:10.984
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.
MARISHA: Solid iron.

01:37:10.984 --> 01:37:12.240
MATT: You can do that.

01:37:13.091 --> 01:37:14.610
That's going to be a little easier for you,

01:37:14.610 --> 01:37:16.800
your halfling fingers.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.980
TRAVIS: No, let him bore out a cannonball.

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:24.020
SAM: Got a Phillips head screwdriver, just going to--

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.530
TRAVIS: Seeing some,

01:37:25.530 --> 01:37:26.680
just a sec, here.

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:31.310
MATT: Terrible Trivium is like, here, do this for me.

01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:35.870
All righty, so go ahead and make a tinkering check for me.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.410
SAM: With advantage?

01:37:38.410 --> 01:37:40.280
MATT: No.
SAM: Okay.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.100
MATT: Add your intelligence modifier.

01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:46.230
And are you proficient with tinker's tools?

01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:47.780
LIAM: Tinker's tools?

01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:50.653
SAM: No, no.

01:37:50.653 --> 01:37:52.000
MATT: All right, so just add your intelligence modifier.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.467
SAM: Eight!
MATT: Okay.

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:55.150
LIAM: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

01:37:55.150 --> 01:37:58.860
MATT: All right, so you craft what smells

01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:03.710
like a vile explosive material

01:38:03.710 --> 01:38:04.660
from your alchemical interest,

01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:07.040
but trying to get it into a pot of some kind,

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.360
you have what you think might be a functional depth charge.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.193
SAM: Nice.

01:38:10.193 --> 01:38:11.400
TRAVIS: You made napalm.
MARISHA: Yeah, you did.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.627
TRAVIS: With a screw-top, a cork.

01:38:13.627 --> 01:38:15.680
MARISHA: What's that chemical smell?

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.310
SAM: Nothing!

01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:18.230
TRAVIS: Are you drinking that?

01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:19.400
Are you passing it around?

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.138
SAM: No, this is explosive.

01:38:21.138 --> 01:38:24.116
TRAVIS: Oh! You made that?
ASHLEY: How does it work? Do you throw it?

01:38:24.116 --> 01:38:26.260
SAM: Well, I think, if it works correctly,

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:27.370
you light the fuse.

01:38:27.370 --> 01:38:29.140
You throw it in the water.

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:33.460
You count five, four, three, two, one, and then...

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.393
TRAVIS: How do you measure--
SAM: (explosion)

01:38:35.393 --> 01:38:38.960
the time until the explosion, effectively?

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.540
SAM: I did some tests with the wick, with the fuse.

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:45.010
ASHLEY: If you throw it in the water, won't it defuse?

01:38:45.010 --> 01:38:47.910
SAM: The fuse is in the barrel, so it won't get,

01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:50.290
I coated it with a little wax, just in case.

01:38:50.290 --> 01:38:51.410
LAURA: That's really cool.
MARISHA: I imagine it's a cross

01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:53.000
between a dragon and a turtle.
LAURA: I'm on the crow's nest.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.610
I am not paying attention to this.

01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:56.910
MATT: Your drawings are now complete,
and they are wonderful.

01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:59.060
LAURA: And I also want to do something else.

01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.140
MATT: Okay.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.170
LAURA: I want to cast Sending.

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:03.530
MATT: Okay.

01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:04.720
LAURA: To the turtle.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.183
MATT: Okay.

01:39:06.183 --> 01:39:07.320
LAURA: To the turtle dragon.

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.153
MATT: Okay.

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.790
In Common?

01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:14.330
LAURA: Sure, but creatures with intelligence scores

01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:16.459
of at least one understand the meaning of your message.

01:39:16.459 --> 01:39:19.610
SAM: Oh!
MATT: You got it, okay.

01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:24.030
LAURA: So with my brainpower,
I'm going to send it a message.

01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:25.250
MATT: Okay.

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:26.083
SAM: You pooping?

01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:30.353
LAURA: O dragon turtle,

01:39:30.353 --> 01:39:33.510
(chuckling)

01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:35.860
I'm so very sorry we attacked you.

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:40.160
I didn't realize you were just searching for your mate.

01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:42.740
And now I feel really guilty.

01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.140
If you need help,

01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:45.120
how many words is this?

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.290
SAM: That's it.
LAURA: Anybody?

01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:47.550
MATT: Yeah, you're done.
TRAVIS: I forgot.

01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:48.400
It's been three months.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:49.280
That's still my thing.
LAURA: I know.

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.550
I was looking to see if you were helping me.

01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:51.580
TRAVIS: I was enjoying the story.

01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:53.003
MATT: You got to keep up with this, Travis.

01:39:53.003 --> 01:39:54.170
TRAVIS: Sorry.

01:39:54.170 --> 01:39:55.720
Fucking boats.
MATT: Okay.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:57.917
Your message is delivered.

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:02.350
What languages do you know?

01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:03.670
LAURA: Common and Infernal.

01:40:03.670 --> 01:40:04.503
MATT: Okay.

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.750
The message returns.

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:10.890
This forceful presence,

01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:13.970
in this deep, gargly, gravelly voice,

01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:17.000
like rocks grinding against each other, beneath the waves,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.241
you hear

01:40:18.241 --> 01:40:23.094
(guttural foreign language)

01:40:23.094 --> 01:40:26.734
(guttural foreign language)

01:40:26.734 --> 01:40:28.170
You have no idea what's being said.

01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:30.060
LAURA: But if I have an intelligence of one,

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.920
do I understand what they are saying?

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:33.430
MATT: Does it say that in the spell?

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:36.800
SAM: We're really pushing the limits--

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.950
LAURA: (reading) "The creature
hears the message in its mind,

01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:41.430
"recognizes you as the sender, and if it knows you,

01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:43.420
"it can answer in a like manner."

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:44.253
SAM: Oh!

01:40:45.690 --> 01:40:49.500
MATT: In a like manner, then yes, then yes,

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.750
you get the--
SAM: If it knows you.

01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:52.440
MATT: You get the gist of it.
LAURA: He knows me!

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.056
It saw me cast spells at it!

01:40:54.056 --> 01:40:55.480
MATT: (laughs)

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.690
Eh, technically.

01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:02.040
The gist of its return message is,

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.360
"I need no mate.

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:06.940
"I take what I want."

01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:09.495
That's it.

01:41:09.495 --> 01:41:10.870
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry)

01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:12.690
TALIESIN: Well, that's good to know.

01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:15.580
LIAM: You possibly remember that Caleb has the ability

01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.890
to help himself or someone understand any language.

01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:19.723
LAURA: Oh, I do too.

01:41:19.723 --> 01:41:21.070
I have that spell.

01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:21.903
SAM: Oh, well.

01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:23.683
LAURA: Oh, it doesn't matter.

01:41:23.683 --> 01:41:25.360
I can still communicate with Sending.

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.770
LIAM: Yeah, there's always tomorrow.

01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:28.170
TRAVIS: What spell is that?

01:41:28.170 --> 01:41:29.450
LIAM: Tongues.
TRAVIS: Tongues.

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:30.940
LAURA: I might have that prepared.

01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.790
TRAVIS: So we should talk to it, the next time.

01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:36.060
By the way, each day, could we have Caduceus, Jester,

01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:38.320
and myself do Control Water, one at a time,

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.170
to give it that extra push behind the boat,

01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:42.030
just because every little bit helps.

01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:43.230
MATT: Sure enough.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:44.610
TALIESIN: I can do it, multiple times, if need be.

01:41:44.610 --> 01:41:46.010
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending again.

01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:46.843
MATT: Okay.

01:41:46.843 --> 01:41:48.220
TRAVIS: And doing it multiple times is a given,

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:49.053
so if you wouldn't mind.

01:41:49.053 --> 01:41:50.070
TALIESIN: Are you doing the fan as well?

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:53.850
LAURA: So if you take what you want,

01:41:53.850 --> 01:41:56.460
why are you following us?

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.750
Do you need something?

01:41:57.750 --> 01:42:02.270
Do you need us to take something for you?

01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:03.470
MARISHA: Yeah, excellent points.

01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:04.380
LAURA: Maybe?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:07.760
MATT: And you've cast Tongues on yourself or not?

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.000
LAURA: Nope, I'm just communicating

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.100
with Sending.
MATT: Okay.

01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.540
The gist is,

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:17.080
"Ships carry treasure.

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.630
"I take what I want."

01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:21.463
LIAM: Ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:42:24.138 --> 01:42:25.470
TRAVIS: Tell him we're broke as fuck?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:27.928
I'm going to send one more Sending.

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.150
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to say:

01:42:31.090 --> 01:42:34.750
Oh man, we are broke as fuck.

01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:36.930
We got nothing!

01:42:36.930 --> 01:42:38.970
MARISHA: Yeah, we got dick statues.

01:42:38.970 --> 01:42:42.090
LAURA: Yeah, I got, like, lots of little dick statues.

01:42:42.090 --> 01:42:43.560
MARISHA: Green cloaks?

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.930
LAURA: That's it.
MARISHA: And Marius.

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.290
MATT: Marius is like, "What was that?"

01:42:52.290 --> 01:42:54.170
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.
MATT: "Okay."

01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:56.933
LAURA: But Darktow has lots.

01:42:56.933 --> 01:42:58.730
SAM: Hmm!

01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:00.390
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:01.770
MARISHA: Yeah!
TRAVIS: Interesting, interesting,

01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:03.080
interesting.
LIAM: Get it, get it, get it.

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.820
TALIESIN: It is very specific that
you mentioned the dick statues.

01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:07.365
That would definitely make me go:

01:43:07.365 --> 01:43:09.229
Hmm, perhaps they're telling the truth.

01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:11.550
MATT: (laughs) Or perhaps I'm going after that ship.

01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:13.100
LAURA: Yeah, right maybe I need to (sobs)!

01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:14.750
TRAVIS: What I've always wanted!

01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:16.288
LAURA: Ee-ooh, ee-ooh, eek!
MATT: ♪ Look at this stuff, ♪

01:43:16.288 --> 01:43:18.595
♪ Isn't it-- ♪
(laughter)

01:43:18.595 --> 01:43:20.814
No, no!

01:43:20.814 --> 01:43:24.020
MARISHA: No, it was so good!

01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:25.083
TRAVIS: It was such a good idea.

01:43:25.083 --> 01:43:26.340
ASHLEY: It was such a good idea.

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.288
MATT: What'd you roll?

01:43:27.288 --> 01:43:28.560
LAURA: One!

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.393
MATT: Okay.

01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.794
LAURA: One measly little one.

01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:39.650
MATT: The essence of the return message you gather is,

01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:44.727
"I have your scent.

01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:47.530
"I take what I want."

01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:48.363
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.
LAURA: Ew!

01:43:48.363 --> 01:43:50.480
SAM: He has our scent, let's change our scent.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.600
TRAVIS: Or let's start pooping in the water.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.433
SAM: Yeah!

01:43:52.433 --> 01:43:54.992
LIAM: I am the original bad dragon.

01:43:54.992 --> 01:43:55.825
TRAVIS: Ah!

01:43:55.825 --> 01:43:56.658
MATT: (laughs)

01:43:56.658 --> 01:43:58.130
TRAVIS: (laughs) Nope, nope.

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.300
LIAM: ♪ Look at this stuff ♪

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:01.960
MATT: See now, that's the Uk'otoa present

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:04.060
I got to get everybody for Christmas.

01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:05.990
TRAVIS: Collecting now.
LIAM: Oh!

01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:07.610
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: Can I ask Orly,

01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:11.520
according to his calculations, how far do you think we are

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.910
from Rumblecusp, the nearest shore?

01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:15.890
MATT: You're a little over a day from it.

01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:16.950
You have one more night's travel,

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:19.640
and you'll hit it, at some point, probably midday, tomorrow.

01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.880
TALIESIN: What if we burn everything we have

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.470
to speed this up, as well?

01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:24.310
MATT: That could help.

01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:27.390
TRAVIS: What else do we have?
TALIESIN: So I'm going to burn,

01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:28.540
since we're doing this,

01:44:33.190 --> 01:44:36.020
I can burn several Control Waters,

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:38.110
to give us a boost.
LAURA: Same.

01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:38.960
MATT: Define several.

01:44:42.257 --> 01:44:46.030
TALIESIN: I'll burn, let's just start,

01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:48.822
how much of a boost does each one give us?

01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:52.900
MATT: Not a tremendous amount, but for about 10 minutes,

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:54.950
it does increase your speed, I'll say,

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.470
I'll say approximately--

01:45:01.164 --> 01:45:03.650
I'll say it'll increase your speed about 25% for 10 minutes,

01:45:03.650 --> 01:45:06.260
which does give you additional coverage,

01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:07.560
with 10 minutes per.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.880
TRAVIS: So, like, 65 miles an hour, instead of 50?

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.310
MATT: Correct.

01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:12.860
And you have four to cast, you said?

01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:14.660
TALIESIN: Well, I currently, well, technically,

01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:16.017
I have three at 4th-level.

01:45:16.017 --> 01:45:19.190
I got to see what it does.

01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:20.680
MATT: You can cast it at higher levels,

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:23.740
it doesn't have a higher-level benefit,

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:25.490
but you can use higher-level slots.

01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:28.570
I mean, if all of you were to cast, I'd say,

01:45:28.570 --> 01:45:32.650
Control Water 10 times, you could be there by the morning.

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:36.830
LAURA: But if he attacks us--

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:37.820
TRAVIS: I only have one.

01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:41.150
LAURA: -- in the evening when we've
used all our spell slots,

01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:42.360
we're fucked.

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.280
LIAM: What about a killer whale towing the boat?

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.530
Could I chip in that way?

01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:50.033
MATT: It's a big boat.

01:45:50.033 --> 01:45:52.500
I don't know if a killer whale pulling is going to

01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:54.750
do a lot, unfortunately.
LIAM: Okay.

01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:55.650
MATT: Fun idea, but.

01:45:57.770 --> 01:46:00.548
LAURA: Can you make our boat weigh less?

01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:03.510
LIAM: No.

01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:05.600
TRAVIS: I mean, we could, if we threw all

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.085
of the defensive shit--
MARISHA: Marius.

01:46:07.085 --> 01:46:09.750
TRAVIS: -- off the boat.
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:10.610
MATT: "What, what's going on?

01:46:10.610 --> 01:46:11.450
"Can I help?"

01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:12.340
MARISHA: No, don't worry about it.

01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:13.180
I already said that.

01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:14.013
MATT: "I'm just trying to help.

01:46:14.013 --> 01:46:15.860
"I'm sorry."
MARISHA: Go away, go cook food.

01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:16.830
MATT: "Fine, I will."
LIAM: I mean, a little,

01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:18.120
I could make the cannons,

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:21.010
I could turn them into wood, for periods of time,

01:46:21.010 --> 01:46:24.000
but if we are overcome by the turtle,

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.150
that would be bad.

01:46:26.150 --> 01:46:27.090
MATT: What, wood cannon?

01:46:27.090 --> 01:46:29.464
Nah, it's great.
LIAM: It only lasts for an hour.

01:46:29.464 --> 01:46:31.514
Then it just reverts back.

01:46:32.490 --> 01:46:33.323
There's the turtle!

01:46:33.323 --> 01:46:35.799
Fire (explosion)!

01:46:35.799 --> 01:46:36.890
MATT: (shrieks)

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:39.520
TALIESIN: Honestly, actually, if the cannons become wood

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.330
for an hour, and then we burn three and three,

01:46:42.330 --> 01:46:47.050
that's an hour of increased speed plus less weight

01:46:47.050 --> 01:46:49.150
on the, I mean, that's both.

01:46:49.150 --> 01:46:51.210
MATT: That is a cannon of eight.

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.430
Amongst the rest of the cargo there,

01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:54.490
it's not going to make that much of a difference.

01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:56.250
LIAM: If I burn the ship, it'll weigh almost nothing.

01:46:56.250 --> 01:46:58.150
MATT: That's true. That's true.

01:46:58.150 --> 01:47:00.430
Now you're cooking with gas, all right.

01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:01.880
TRAVIS: The ship can carry 100 tons,

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.451
so it won't make a difference.

01:47:03.451 --> 01:47:04.643
LAURA: Yeah.

01:47:04.643 --> 01:47:06.522
TALIESIN: Yeah, I suppose it's up to you, Captain.

01:47:06.522 --> 01:47:10.180
Every push is one last thing I can't do later,

01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.642
but I'll give you whatever you want.

01:47:11.642 --> 01:47:15.540
TRAVIS: Until the new day, I would love that you could burn

01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.190
whatever you feel like you can.

01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:18.023
TALIESIN: All right.

01:47:18.023 --> 01:47:20.620
TRAVIS: And we'll just ride.

01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.330
LAURA: I'm too scared to do it.

01:47:22.330 --> 01:47:23.671
I'm too scared to do it.

01:47:23.671 --> 01:47:25.070
I think he's going to attack us soon.

01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:26.960
He sounded pretty aggressive about it.

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.250
TALIESIN: Let's, uh, maybe one each, at least.

01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:32.083
LAURA: All right.

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:36.640
MARISHA: By the way, "I don't need a mate" is the battle cry

01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.302
of a horny, lonely person.

01:47:38.302 --> 01:47:41.182
(laughter)

01:47:41.182 --> 01:47:42.400
LIAM: I don't need a mate.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.200
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: You're burning a single one?

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.970
MARISHA: He clearly has a hole

01:47:45.970 --> 01:47:47.732
in his heart.
TALIESIN: You burn one?

01:47:47.732 --> 01:47:50.293
LAURA: I just don't think it makes
that much of a difference.

01:47:50.293 --> 01:47:52.350
Two wouldn't make that much of a difference.

01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:53.790
MATT: Two isn't going to make a huge difference.

01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:54.840
TALIESIN: Okay, then.

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.450
LAURA: And it would just keep us from being able

01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:57.690
to do something.
MATT: 10 total casts,

01:47:57.690 --> 01:48:01.750
you'll cut off, like, roughly six hours of travel time.

01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:03.715
That's up to you guys, though.

01:48:06.439 --> 01:48:08.855
LIAM: This thing isn't in shape to fight, right?
TRAVIS: Beau.

01:48:08.855 --> 01:48:11.240
If we do find sight

01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:13.760
on the dragon turtle again, I want you to steer the ship,

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.820
and I'll make myself available for magics.

01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:20.500
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, whatever you need, Captain.

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.610
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:48:22.610 --> 01:48:24.340
TALIESIN: Oh, is this a new day, by the way?

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.330
Oh, and that's not an answer.

01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:28.090
MARISHA: Touch and steer.

01:48:28.090 --> 01:48:30.580
TRAVIS: Have you steered the ship before?

01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:31.705
MARISHA: I think I have.

01:48:31.705 --> 01:48:33.550
I think I have, once.

01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:34.870
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: No, I still have,

01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:36.460
I still have my 5th-level Commune, don't I--

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:38.200
TRAVIS: You want to, like, shadow me

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:40.770
for a little bit here.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:42.790
MATT: Yes, you would have another Commune.

01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:44.590
TALIESIN: Okay, and then I'm going to burn

01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:46.470
one more Commune.
TRAVIS: Less than 24 hours.

01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:48.365
LIAM: So either fight it or get to land.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:48:48.365 --> 01:48:50.340
LIAM: Get on land, we're fine.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:53.040
Well, it can go on land, too, but.

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.460
LIAM: Can it?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:55.980
I mean, it's a turtle, right?

01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:57.450
LIAM: It's got these.

01:48:57.450 --> 01:49:00.945
TALIESIN: As things stand right now--

01:49:00.945 --> 01:49:02.422
MATT: This is the same day, right?

01:49:02.422 --> 01:49:03.604
TALIESIN: Hmm?
MATT: Same day.

01:49:03.604 --> 01:49:06.070
TALIESIN: Oh, same day? So this is
my second 5th-level, right?

01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:09.250
MATT: Right? Yes, the second-to-last, yeah.

01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:13.350
TALIESIN: So all things-- as things stand--

01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:14.860
TRAVIS: I hadn't thought about that part.

01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:18.180
TALIESIN: Will we come in contact with this turtle dragon

01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:23.162
in the next day, in the next 24 hours?

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.280
MATT: The ocean breeze surrounds you, as your eyes close,

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:30.850
and you once again envision the waters parting,

01:49:30.850 --> 01:49:32.040
below the surface.

01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.570
You can sense, along with the Wild Mother's guidance

01:49:34.570 --> 01:49:38.460
and her connection with all things within the ocean,

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:41.450
that while this entity trudges forward,

01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:44.837
it doesn't trudge directly on the right course.

01:49:45.730 --> 01:49:46.563
SAM: Ooh.
TRAVIS: I love it.

01:49:46.563 --> 01:49:47.857
The Wild Mother's our Garmin.

01:49:47.857 --> 01:49:49.400
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.233
TALIESIN: All things--

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.840
All things as they stand-- two days?

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:57.930
MARISHA: GPS [inaudible]?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:49:57.930 --> 01:50:01.820
MARISHA: Oh jeez (laughs).

01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:02.653
MATT: No.

01:50:05.170 --> 01:50:07.040
TRAVIS: Took it right back.

01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.340
TALIESIN: Can it smell us?

01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:20.573
MATT: You get the sense that it--

01:50:22.388 --> 01:50:25.021
it's not scent more than

01:50:25.021 --> 01:50:29.390
that it has a way of following, to an extent.

01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:30.510
TALIESIN: All right.

01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:32.038
LAURA: (like Vex) Hunter's Mark!

01:50:32.038 --> 01:50:34.170
TRAVIS: It can feel the disturbance in the water.

01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:36.860
TALIESIN: So yeah, so from what I took from that,

01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:38.740
and sorry, just communication's weird,

01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:42.720
because the set's weird, the next 24 hours,

01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:45.460
it's probably not going to make it's way to it,

01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:46.460
to us, all things being equal.

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:48.550
MATT: You feel pretty confident that
it's not going to happen, yeah.

01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:49.550
TALIESIN: I say we burn it all.

01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:51.400
I'm going to burn it all.

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.100
Thank you, all right.

01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.240
MARISHA: We're going to have to fight this guy

01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.140
on our way out of Rumblecusp.

01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:56.130
TALIESIN: That's fine.

01:50:56.130 --> 01:50:58.680
TRAVIS: We're going to build a community on Rumblecusp

01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.270
and live there for the rest of our lives.

01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:01.340
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, that's fine.

01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:03.450
ASHLEY: Or at least we'll save the ship.

01:51:03.450 --> 01:51:04.283
SAM: You know what?

01:51:04.283 --> 01:51:05.970
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: When we leave Rumblecusp,

01:51:05.970 --> 01:51:09.610
we'll send all the followers out, before us.

01:51:09.610 --> 01:51:11.395
LAURA: Oh, good thinking, and that way--

01:51:11.395 --> 01:51:12.353
TRAVIS: Chum the waters.
LAURA: -- we don't have to deal

01:51:12.353 --> 01:51:14.901
with them anymore.

01:51:14.901 --> 01:51:18.720
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn four, if you've got six.

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:20.020
LAURA: I don't have six.

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.750
TALIESIN: Even at higher levels?

01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:22.990
I don't have six, too.

01:51:22.990 --> 01:51:24.119
I'm just burning everything.

01:51:24.119 --> 01:51:26.540
LAURA: ♪ A little la, dee, dooh-dee, dah, lee ♪

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:28.460
But if he's not going to reach us within 24 hours,

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.500
what difference does it make?

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.680
TALIESIN: I'm just playing it safe.

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.440
LIAM: You have to sign a release form,

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.420
if you want to travel on.
TALIESIN: Or at least,

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:35.730
I'll burn three, at the very least.

01:51:35.730 --> 01:51:36.563
MATT: So burn three? All right,

01:51:36.563 --> 01:51:38.230
you'll get there a few hours early then.

01:51:38.230 --> 01:51:41.480
TALIESIN: And if Beau's going to do her fan thing--

01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:43.430
LAURA: Oh yeah, it's a new day.
MARISHA: Ooh, I can do that.

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:44.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:48.120
It does a little gust of wind for a hot second.

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:49.570
MATT: And the percentage to see if it destroys itself is

01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:50.960
if you do it multiple times in the same day, right?

01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:51.793
MARISHA: Correct.

01:51:51.793 --> 01:51:52.700
So I'm only doing it once a day,

01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:53.533
because I don't want to risk it.

01:51:53.533 --> 01:51:54.670
MATT: You got it, of course.

01:51:54.670 --> 01:51:57.120
All right, so we'll say, for the sake of brevity,

01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:00.960
between the spells that you cast that help to push it along,

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:04.260
as the waves swell behind, to push your ship

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.090
in the direction you wish it to go,

01:52:06.090 --> 01:52:08.360
the wind itself working, not against you,

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:10.650
maybe slightly in your favor, at times,

01:52:10.650 --> 01:52:13.010
the fan giving you a little boost,

01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:15.488
you go through the final night of travel.

01:52:15.488 --> 01:52:18.150
The sun rises on the final day,

01:52:18.150 --> 01:52:22.310
and about 9:30, 10 o'clock in the morning or so,

01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:26.340
you begin to see the shape of a landmass,

01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:29.480
in the direction you are facing on the ship.

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:34.370
Getting closer, you can see, at this distance,

01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:36.750
these winding mountains,

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:41.343
this unique shape to them, like

01:52:44.101 --> 01:52:46.477
like tower trees that poke out of a flower,

01:52:46.477 --> 01:52:48.800
like the mountain range itself is very wild,

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:53.800
and these very thin switchback ridges give it this odd,

01:52:55.967 --> 01:52:57.860
an opening-flower appearance to it.

01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:00.720
And in the center of it, you see this one massive mountain,

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:03.630
in which this lazy trail of smoke just drifts

01:53:03.630 --> 01:53:04.917
from the peak.

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:10.920
The majority of this mountain is dense, lush jungle,

01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:14.690
entirely across, and you can see this faint ring

01:53:14.690 --> 01:53:17.860
of white sand beaches and rocky cliffs

01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:20.830
that meet on the outskirts of it.

01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:24.913
But there before you, you see, approaching quickly--

01:53:24.913 --> 01:53:26.350
LAURA: Rrr-umble!

01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:28.103
MATT: The island of Rumblecusp.

01:53:28.103 --> 01:53:29.124
We're going to go and take a break.

01:53:29.124 --> 01:53:31.630
(cheering)

01:53:31.630 --> 01:53:32.463
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:53:32.463 --> 01:53:33.621
TRAVIS: We made it to break!

01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:35.050
MARISHA and ASHLEY: We made it to break!

01:53:35.050 --> 01:53:36.717
MATT: You did. You made it to break.
LIAM: We're alive!

01:53:36.717 --> 01:53:38.077
MARISHA: I've never been so excited for a break.

01:53:38.077 --> 01:53:39.370
SAM: Feels so great.

01:53:39.370 --> 01:53:40.580
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.100
to pick up where Rumblecusp has in store.

01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:47.340
Yeah, we have no other announcements or giveaways and stuff,

01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:48.700
during the break, so we're just going to go ahead

01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:50.520
and see you guys in a few minutes.

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.369
(cheering)

02:18:33.771 --> 02:18:35.181
MATT: And welcome back.

02:18:35.181 --> 02:18:37.781
So before we jump into it, I want to give a big thanks

02:18:37.781 --> 02:18:41.691
to Critter Hannah Lampe, who send out this mini

02:18:41.691 --> 02:18:44.911
that they had painted three months ago,

02:18:44.911 --> 02:18:47.211
after the last episode, and I've kept

02:18:47.211 --> 02:18:48.970
care of it very soon, but you should check them out

02:18:48.970 --> 02:18:52.601
at @Art_ForArtsSake, on Twitter.

02:18:52.601 --> 02:18:53.434
Thank you so much, Hannah.

02:18:53.434 --> 02:18:55.121
ASHLEY: It is so cool.
TRAVIS: Oh, oh boy!

02:18:56.241 --> 02:18:59.661
MATT: So you guys approach

02:18:59.661 --> 02:19:04.661
what would be the southeastern inlet to Rumblecusp.

02:19:05.011 --> 02:19:07.741
You can see this faint mist that still sits

02:19:07.741 --> 02:19:11.071
over a large portion of the outer jungle vicinity.

02:19:11.071 --> 02:19:13.361
Between that and the strange winding,

02:19:13.361 --> 02:19:16.261
switchback mountain range that lead to that giant,

02:19:16.261 --> 02:19:19.921
pinnacle mountaintop, has a very dreamlike quality,

02:19:19.921 --> 02:19:24.141
in this still morning phase of the day.

02:19:24.141 --> 02:19:27.231
Eventually, you push up into the main inlet,

02:19:27.231 --> 02:19:29.971
and you don't know if you can get much closer

02:19:29.971 --> 02:19:33.591
without getting your ship into some serious trouble.

02:19:33.591 --> 02:19:35.681
You can look beneath the water and see there are sand banks

02:19:35.681 --> 02:19:37.891
that wind out beyond the beach,

02:19:37.891 --> 02:19:41.001
that look like these white tendrils

02:19:41.001 --> 02:19:44.201
beneath the ocean, and you're a few hundred feet back

02:19:44.201 --> 02:19:46.781
from the actual island itself, before you probably have

02:19:46.781 --> 02:19:49.861
to drop anchor and then go out on a small skiff.

02:19:49.861 --> 02:19:51.901
LAURA: Do we see any other boats?

02:19:51.901 --> 02:19:53.121
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:19:56.391 --> 02:19:57.788
LAURA: Ooh!

02:19:57.788 --> 02:19:58.624
24.

02:19:58.624 --> 02:19:59.651
MATT: Nice.

02:19:59.651 --> 02:20:02.771
Looking around the vicinity, you do not see any boats.

02:20:02.771 --> 02:20:04.491
LAURA: We're the first ones here, you guys!

02:20:04.491 --> 02:20:05.381
TRAVIS: Anyone on the beaches?

02:20:05.381 --> 02:20:07.401
Anything that we can see, structures, people?

02:20:07.401 --> 02:20:08.571
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:20:08.571 --> 02:20:10.148
SAM: We're the first ones here?

02:20:10.148 --> 02:20:11.908
LAURA: Traveler!

02:20:11.908 --> 02:20:12.821
Are you here yet?

02:20:12.821 --> 02:20:14.571
MATT: Isn't it in, like, a couple of days?

02:20:14.571 --> 02:20:16.091
<i>No one</i> has shown up yet?

02:20:16.091 --> 02:20:17.201
LAURA: Traveler!

02:20:17.201 --> 02:20:20.351
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, you don't want to be early.

02:20:20.351 --> 02:20:24.101
SAM: I know, but it's a long journey for many people.

02:20:24.101 --> 02:20:26.211
ASHLEY: Well, it does give us a little time to set up.

02:20:26.211 --> 02:20:27.161
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Sure, sure.

02:20:27.161 --> 02:20:28.621
LAURA: Artagan!

02:20:28.621 --> 02:20:31.071
MATT: You have roughly a week or so, or just under a week.

02:20:31.071 --> 02:20:32.411
ASHLEY: Oh, okay.
LAURA: Oh!

02:20:32.411 --> 02:20:33.361
We're super early.
MATT: I'll look at the specifics,

02:20:33.361 --> 02:20:34.681
but yeah.
SAM: Great, no, that's good.

02:20:34.681 --> 02:20:37.401
We can set up bathrooms and things.

02:20:37.401 --> 02:20:38.234
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:20:38.234 --> 02:20:39.091
Some tents, make them

02:20:39.091 --> 02:20:40.271
some sandwiches.
TRAVIS: We have our pick

02:20:40.271 --> 02:20:42.981
of the Fyre Fest tents.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:20:42.981 --> 02:20:45.611
And make some booths, so people can get their badges

02:20:45.611 --> 02:20:47.019
upon arrival.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:20:47.019 --> 02:20:48.301
MARISHA: A little check-in station.

02:20:48.301 --> 02:20:49.929
TALIESIN: What? All right.

02:20:49.929 --> 02:20:52.401
TRAVIS: I guess we'll bring the ship
within a reasonable distance

02:20:52.401 --> 02:20:55.651
and go ahead and drop anchor, prepare the tenders.

02:20:55.651 --> 02:21:00.301
Do we need to bring anything from the boat ashore with us?

02:21:00.301 --> 02:21:02.791
Gunpowder, are you going to make fluffernutters,

02:21:02.791 --> 02:21:04.901
in case of emergency?

02:21:04.901 --> 02:21:07.621
SAM: This is up to the mistress of ceremonies.

02:21:07.621 --> 02:21:10.641
LAURA: Well, I personally think we should take everything

02:21:10.641 --> 02:21:11.951
off the boat and bring it to shore,

02:21:11.951 --> 02:21:14.621
because I'm pretty sure the dragon turtle is going

02:21:14.621 --> 02:21:19.424
to come and destroy the boat, while we're here.

02:21:19.424 --> 02:21:21.971
TALIESIN: That is a distinct possibility, yes.

02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:25.871
LIAM: That would be a shame, to lose the boat.

02:21:25.871 --> 02:21:27.321
LAURA: Yeah.

02:21:27.321 --> 02:21:28.321
TRAVIS: We could run it--

02:21:29.491 --> 02:21:32.951
So there are reefs about 200 yards outside of

02:21:32.951 --> 02:21:34.011
where the actual shoreline is?

02:21:34.011 --> 02:21:35.491
MATT: Not reefs so much as they're sand banks.

02:21:35.491 --> 02:21:36.324
TRAVIS: Sand banks, right,

02:21:36.324 --> 02:21:38.071
and there's no way inside of those, right?

02:21:38.071 --> 02:21:39.821
MATT: I mean, you can get as close as you can,

02:21:39.821 --> 02:21:42.351
but you're still going to be probably about 100 and--

02:21:42.351 --> 02:21:45.391
TRAVIS: I mean, we can try and
run the ship slightly aground,

02:21:45.391 --> 02:21:47.826
but it's so, eww!

02:21:47.826 --> 02:21:48.781
TALIESIN: Wow.
SAM: Yeah, and also,

02:21:48.781 --> 02:21:50.291
what if we need to leave in a hurry?

02:21:50.291 --> 02:21:52.021
That's not very wise.

02:21:52.021 --> 02:21:55.351
We should just leave our shit on the boat.

02:21:55.351 --> 02:21:57.781
TRAVIS: Yeah, what would we take from here?

02:21:57.781 --> 02:21:59.091
TALIESIN: Anything valuable.

02:21:59.091 --> 02:21:59.992
LIAM: Anything valuable--
LAURA: Lots and lots

02:21:59.992 --> 02:22:02.331
of little dick statues.
LIAM: I mean, I could get us all

02:22:02.331 --> 02:22:04.391
off of this island, easily,

02:22:04.391 --> 02:22:05.921
but we would lose the boat.

02:22:05.921 --> 02:22:08.761
TRAVIS: But we don't need the cannons or the--

02:22:08.761 --> 02:22:09.681
SAM: Or Marius.

02:22:11.111 --> 02:22:13.591
TRAVIS: Oh, right, I mean, I think they all come with us.

02:22:13.591 --> 02:22:15.781
MATT: You see him, Marius, like, raising his, like, "What?"

02:22:15.781 --> 02:22:18.258
And Orly goes, "No, no."

02:22:18.258 --> 02:22:20.451
(laughter)

02:22:20.451 --> 02:22:25.191
TRAVIS: All right, let's prepare to exit the ship,

02:22:25.191 --> 02:22:29.401
and how many tenders do we have on this?

02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:30.594
MATT: Currently, only one.

02:22:30.594 --> 02:22:31.531
TRAVIS: (lips smacking)

02:22:31.531 --> 02:22:32.364
Right, trips.

02:22:32.364 --> 02:22:34.671
SAM: We can all walk on water, can't we?

02:22:34.671 --> 02:22:36.251
MATT: You guys can all make it in one tender,

02:22:36.251 --> 02:22:39.909
just the eight of you, or seven of you, sorry.

02:22:39.909 --> 02:22:42.041
But there won't be anybody to bring it back to shore,

02:22:42.041 --> 02:22:42.874
which means it'll have

02:22:42.874 --> 02:22:45.191
to reside on the beach.

02:22:45.191 --> 02:22:46.841
TRAVIS: I am worried about Orly and the rest

02:22:46.841 --> 02:22:48.711
of them being on a ship, out here.

02:22:48.711 --> 02:22:50.541
LAURA: Well, we can walk there.
TALIESIN: Perhaps they should camp

02:22:50.541 --> 02:22:53.201
off the ship then.

02:22:53.201 --> 02:22:57.401
TRAVIS: So maybe two trips, and we'll bring seven ashore,

02:22:57.401 --> 02:22:58.461
and then someone will go back

02:22:58.461 --> 02:23:01.218
and bring the other four crew members.

02:23:01.218 --> 02:23:03.239
MATT: (as Orly) "Very well, Captain.

02:23:03.239 --> 02:23:04.791
"No worries.

02:23:04.791 --> 02:23:07.041
"Bring it around, everybody."

02:23:07.041 --> 02:23:09.711
TRAVIS: Orly is dependable as fuck.

02:23:09.711 --> 02:23:11.081
MATT: He goes ahead and gathers the crew.

02:23:11.081 --> 02:23:14.051
They start getting supplies, camping materials,

02:23:14.051 --> 02:23:16.841
and slowly, you make your way to shore,

02:23:16.841 --> 02:23:18.731
not an intense process at all,

02:23:18.731 --> 02:23:20.931
two trips back, in under 20 or so minutes.

02:23:20.931 --> 02:23:22.121
You have everybody on the beaches.

02:23:22.121 --> 02:23:23.921
The beaches aren't long.

02:23:23.921 --> 02:23:27.701
They're about maybe 30 feet between the water's edge

02:23:27.701 --> 02:23:30.891
and where the treeline, the very thick treeline, begins.

02:23:30.891 --> 02:23:34.518
So it's enough, but it's not a massive swathe of land.

02:23:34.518 --> 02:23:36.491
LAURA: I'm just shouting into the trees.

02:23:36.491 --> 02:23:40.313
Traveler, are you here?

02:23:40.313 --> 02:23:41.616
Hello, we're here!

02:23:41.616 --> 02:23:43.231
MATT: Make a perception check, if you want.

02:23:45.151 --> 02:23:46.611
LAURA: Guidance!

02:23:47.801 --> 02:23:49.084
Oh no (laughs).

02:23:52.176 --> 02:23:54.411
11.

02:23:54.411 --> 02:23:55.426
MATT: 11?
TRAVIS: Were those wings?

02:23:55.426 --> 02:23:57.181
LAURA: Yeah (laughs).
MATT: Not great.

02:23:58.321 --> 02:23:59.154
All right.

02:24:00.321 --> 02:24:01.881
You see no movement.

02:24:01.881 --> 02:24:03.571
Though, as you are shouting, you watch as some

02:24:03.571 --> 02:24:04.571
of the trees rustle a bit,

02:24:04.571 --> 02:24:07.161
and (flapping) a cluster

02:24:07.161 --> 02:24:10.111
of jungle birds escape from the nearby canopy

02:24:10.111 --> 02:24:13.490
and just coast around and out of sight.

02:24:13.490 --> 02:24:15.781
LAURA: Do you think this island is safe?

02:24:15.781 --> 02:24:18.761
SAM: Well, there's one way to find out.

02:24:18.761 --> 02:24:20.961
We should do an assessment, right?

02:24:20.961 --> 02:24:24.591
We need to find a place for people to congregate.

02:24:24.591 --> 02:24:28.316
We need a place for you to hold your ceremonies or whatever.

02:24:28.316 --> 02:24:30.641
We should do a sort of--

02:24:30.641 --> 02:24:31.661
LIAM: We need to scout the island to--

02:24:31.661 --> 02:24:32.891
SAM: We need to scout the island.

02:24:32.891 --> 02:24:34.211
LIAM: -- understand the lay of the land

02:24:34.211 --> 02:24:35.451
and what we can do.
LAURA: I'm going to set

02:24:35.451 --> 02:24:38.011
down a ritual to commune with the Traveler.

02:24:38.011 --> 02:24:39.611
MATT: All righty.

02:24:39.611 --> 02:24:42.419
SAM: This is your thing, though, not his.
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

02:24:42.419 --> 02:24:44.831
TRAVIS: While you're doing that, could we have one of you,

02:24:44.831 --> 02:24:46.181
that are able to change your form,

02:24:46.181 --> 02:24:48.041
perhaps to do a little aerial investigation

02:24:48.041 --> 02:24:49.671
of this side of the island, from the air.

02:24:49.671 --> 02:24:51.121
MARISHA: I was just thinking the same thing.

02:24:51.121 --> 02:24:55.051
Want to make sure there's no fiends abound.

02:24:55.051 --> 02:24:57.031
TRAVIS: Trees moving, clearings,

02:24:57.031 --> 02:24:58.651
things that can be spotted from about.

02:24:58.651 --> 02:24:59.484
TALIESIN: Giant turtles.

02:25:00.401 --> 02:25:02.461
MARISHA: I'll take the west side

02:25:03.507 --> 02:25:06.481
and do a little perimeter scout--

02:25:06.481 --> 02:25:10.091
MATT: Just go around the perimeter of the waterline?

02:25:10.091 --> 02:25:12.581
MARISHA: Yeah, just into the treeline where we are,

02:25:12.581 --> 02:25:15.211
and do a beach line and see.
MATT: Okay, got it.

02:25:15.211 --> 02:25:16.421
You got it.

02:25:16.421 --> 02:25:19.271
LIAM: I'll take some time to turn my cat into more

02:25:19.271 --> 02:25:22.081
of a bird of paradise and send him up--

02:25:22.081 --> 02:25:23.397
LAURA: That's a plant.

02:25:23.397 --> 02:25:25.134
LIAM: Is it?
MARISHA: (thwacks)

02:25:25.134 --> 02:25:26.281
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

02:25:26.281 --> 02:25:27.661
MARISHA: Well, it's a plant and a bird.

02:25:27.661 --> 02:25:29.811
MATT: It's both, it's both.

02:25:30.742 --> 02:25:31.575
They're giving you shit.
MARISHA: There are, like, several

02:25:31.575 --> 02:25:34.121
birds of paradises, but also, yeah, we're giving you shit.

02:25:34.121 --> 02:25:35.520
TALIESIN: They talk at the enchanted tiki room, though.

02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:36.681
LIAM: I probably wouldn't make it a plant, then.

02:25:36.681 --> 02:25:38.381
I'd probably make the bird, like I intended.

02:25:38.381 --> 02:25:40.611
TRAVIS: Toucan, toucan.

02:25:40.611 --> 02:25:42.151
TALIESIN: They croon.
MATT: All right, so,

02:25:42.151 --> 02:25:43.782
bird of paradise, fair enough.

02:25:43.782 --> 02:25:47.721
LIAM: A beautifully colorful bird is now up in the air,

02:25:47.721 --> 02:25:48.554
10 minutes later.
MATT: Indeed.

02:25:48.554 --> 02:25:50.211
You can produce a colorless mana.

02:25:50.211 --> 02:25:51.121
LIAM: And I will remove

02:25:51.121 --> 02:25:54.971
the shit from my--
TALIESIN: (whistling)

02:25:54.971 --> 02:25:58.163
MATT: Sorry, I had--
wow, that was a middle school flashback.

02:25:59.731 --> 02:26:01.041
Well, mana of any color, not colorless.

02:26:01.041 --> 02:26:01.901
That's my bad.

02:26:01.901 --> 02:26:02.881
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:26:02.881 --> 02:26:04.751
MATT: So you complete that.

02:26:04.751 --> 02:26:06.891
You're having a Commune.

02:26:06.891 --> 02:26:07.941
SAM: Is anyone going to turn--

02:26:07.941 --> 02:26:10.749
so Frumpkin's going to be a bird and search around?

02:26:10.749 --> 02:26:11.582
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
SAM: I'll go

02:26:11.582 --> 02:26:13.541
the opposite direction from Beau

02:26:13.541 --> 02:26:16.721
and just scout the other beach, the other way on the beach.

02:26:16.721 --> 02:26:19.461
MATT: Okay, you guys are just keeping an eye out

02:26:19.461 --> 02:26:20.661
for anything out of the ordinary?

02:26:20.661 --> 02:26:23.491
SAM: Looking for any structures or anything weird.

02:26:23.491 --> 02:26:25.911
MATT: Perception check.
MARISHA: Animals, beasts.

02:26:25.911 --> 02:26:27.928
MATT: You got it. Perception check, each of you guys.

02:26:27.928 --> 02:26:28.783
MARISHA: Perception?
SAM: Yeah.

02:26:28.783 --> 02:26:30.361
MARISHA: Why is it always perception?

02:26:30.361 --> 02:26:31.291
MATT: There's only a minute casting time.

02:26:31.291 --> 02:26:32.451
MARISHA: Natural one!

02:26:32.451 --> 02:26:35.661
MATT: Oof.
MARISHA: Fucking titties.

02:26:35.661 --> 02:26:37.651
SAM: 11!
LIAM: That's the goal.

02:26:37.651 --> 02:26:38.484
MATT: All right.

02:26:38.484 --> 02:26:42.863
(laughter)

02:26:42.863 --> 02:26:46.230
TALIESIN: Took me a minute to get there.
TRAVIS: Well done.

02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:47.467
ASHLEY: Very well done.

02:26:49.677 --> 02:26:52.465
MATT: Even when Beauregard loses, she wins.

02:26:52.465 --> 02:26:55.181
All right, so you guys spend time doing a bit

02:26:55.181 --> 02:26:58.514
of perimeter search around the vicinity.

02:26:59.541 --> 02:27:01.208
Nothing catches your eye.

02:27:03.345 --> 02:27:05.801
The sands here seem fairly untouched, if hot now,

02:27:05.801 --> 02:27:08.406
with the sunlight coming down.

02:27:11.941 --> 02:27:15.071
It is a hot day, and it is a clear day.

02:27:15.071 --> 02:27:18.161
But there's still mist visible in element of the jungle.

02:27:18.161 --> 02:27:20.621
From a natural weather standpoint,

02:27:20.621 --> 02:27:22.413
that does not quite--

02:27:23.281 --> 02:27:25.121
MARISHA: Make sense.
MATT: -- coincide.

02:27:25.121 --> 02:27:26.971
TRAVIS: About what time of day?

02:27:26.971 --> 02:27:28.801
MATT: At this point, after you've gotten to land

02:27:28.801 --> 02:27:31.381
and situated yourself, you're pushing noon,

02:27:31.381 --> 02:27:33.101
because you did make a little time from the Control Waters.

02:27:33.101 --> 02:27:34.481
LAURA: Is my ritual complete yet?

02:27:34.481 --> 02:27:36.034
MATT: The ritual takes a minute to cast,
so it's super quick.

02:27:36.034 --> 02:27:37.071
LAURA: Well, I did it as a ritual,

02:27:37.071 --> 02:27:39.231
so it's a 10-minute--
MATT: Oh, okay, so 10 minutes.

02:27:39.231 --> 02:27:40.121
Okay.

02:27:40.121 --> 02:27:40.954
Wait, can it be done?

02:27:40.954 --> 02:27:41.991
Yes, it can.
LAURA: Those little statues

02:27:41.991 --> 02:27:44.451
with little drawings in the sand, around me.

02:27:44.451 --> 02:27:47.081
MATT: All right, so as you do your little sketches

02:27:47.081 --> 02:27:48.951
and prepare yourself, as everyone wanders off

02:27:48.951 --> 02:27:53.491
to find their places, you concentrate and think real hard

02:27:53.491 --> 02:27:56.591
about the Traveler, and after a moment,

02:27:56.591 --> 02:27:59.221
you feel the hands on the shoulders

02:27:59.221 --> 02:28:02.121
and leaning in over on of you, he goes,

02:28:02.121 --> 02:28:03.641
"Yes, Jester, may I help you?"

02:28:05.341 --> 02:28:06.174
LAURA: You're here!

02:28:06.174 --> 02:28:08.771
MATT: He spins around and sits down
on the sand across from you.

02:28:08.771 --> 02:28:09.641
"I am."

02:28:12.421 --> 02:28:14.421
LAURA: Do you have a place picked out for us?

02:28:15.331 --> 02:28:16.531
MATT: "We're here, aren't we?"

02:28:17.801 --> 02:28:19.001
That's your first question.

02:28:19.001 --> 02:28:20.501
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: Oh boy.

02:28:22.861 --> 02:28:25.851
LAURA: Is there anything dangerous on the island?

02:28:25.851 --> 02:28:27.341
MATT: "What island would it be

02:28:27.341 --> 02:28:29.521
"if there wasn't anything dangerous on it?

02:28:29.521 --> 02:28:31.082
"Of course, there is."
LAURA: Okay, that's cool,

02:28:31.082 --> 02:28:32.778
cool, cool.

02:28:35.303 --> 02:28:38.571
Third question, yes or no,

02:28:40.461 --> 02:28:42.286
am I still your favorite?

02:28:42.286 --> 02:28:46.742
MATT: "(laughs) Very yes, always yes.

02:28:46.742 --> 02:28:47.871
"It's not even a question, my dear."

02:28:47.871 --> 02:28:51.251
LAURA: Oh, good. We saw a dragon turtle.

02:28:51.251 --> 02:28:52.471
MATT: "That's impressive."

02:28:52.471 --> 02:28:53.304
LAURA: I know.

02:28:54.291 --> 02:28:57.361
It tried to kill us.

02:28:57.361 --> 02:28:59.221
I turned it into a little turtle.

02:28:59.221 --> 02:29:00.831
It was still following us.

02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:02.581
Caleb turned it into a slug.

02:29:02.581 --> 02:29:04.211
I think it's still tracking us.

02:29:04.211 --> 02:29:05.686
MATT: "Interesting."

02:29:08.125 --> 02:29:09.781
LAURA: No, I'm your favorite!
MATT: "I'm terribly sorry.

02:29:09.781 --> 02:29:11.701
"You are my favorite, but I have others

02:29:11.701 --> 02:29:14.461
"that are requesting my presence.

02:29:14.461 --> 02:29:16.531
"I have to run.

02:29:16.531 --> 02:29:18.001
"Take care, be safe.

02:29:18.001 --> 02:29:19.731
"Time's quick. I'll be back soon."

02:29:19.731 --> 02:29:20.564
LAURA: So soon?

02:29:20.564 --> 02:29:21.471
MATT: "Yes, very.

02:29:21.471 --> 02:29:22.304
"Oh, what's over there?"

02:29:22.304 --> 02:29:25.451
LAURA: Hmm, I'm not falling for that, but you can poof.

02:29:25.451 --> 02:29:28.176
It's okay.
SAM: (chokes, laughs)

02:29:28.176 --> 02:29:30.661
MATT: (whooshes)

02:29:30.661 --> 02:29:32.261
And he vanishes into the wind.

02:29:33.542 --> 02:29:36.961
TRAVIS: You can poof.
MATT: (laughs)

02:29:36.961 --> 02:29:38.341
LAURA: There's something dangerous on the island.

02:29:38.341 --> 02:29:41.731
We're probably going to have to fight it.

02:29:41.731 --> 02:29:43.051
Is anybody around?

02:29:43.051 --> 02:29:44.141
Where is everyone?

02:29:44.141 --> 02:29:45.631
TALIESIN: I'm not that far away.

02:29:45.631 --> 02:29:46.921
MARISHA: Coast is clear over here.

02:29:46.921 --> 02:29:49.476
TRAVIS: Caleb's flying his bird around.

02:29:50.621 --> 02:29:51.941
MARISHA: Veth.
LIAM: I'm sending Frumpkin--

02:29:51.941 --> 02:29:53.991
SAM: East beach is clear!
MARISHA: Yeah, we're great.

02:29:53.991 --> 02:29:54.824
LIAM: --in a wide arc.

02:29:54.824 --> 02:29:56.221
I'll spend 30 minutes doing it.

02:29:56.221 --> 02:29:58.241
MATT: You got it. Perception check from Frumpkin.

02:29:58.241 --> 02:30:00.441
LIAM: Balls, I'm sure it's going to be balls.

02:30:00.441 --> 02:30:01.961
Oh, it's not balls.

02:30:01.961 --> 02:30:02.881
19.

02:30:02.881 --> 02:30:04.614
MATT: 19, okay.

02:30:05.811 --> 02:30:08.721
LAURA: First. Time. Ever.

02:30:08.721 --> 02:30:10.101
MATT: No, actually, Frumpkin's had a good couple

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:10.934
of rolls recently.
LIAM: Second.

02:30:10.934 --> 02:30:12.441
MATT: There you go, second.

02:30:12.441 --> 02:30:14.661
Second time's the charm.

02:30:14.661 --> 02:30:15.631
No, it isn't.

02:30:15.631 --> 02:30:20.011
Anyway, beyond the mist,

02:30:20.011 --> 02:30:22.411
the trees here are extremely tall.

02:30:22.411 --> 02:30:24.711
The canopies are 100 or more feet up.

02:30:24.711 --> 02:30:28.271
The jungle trees themselves, their trunks are thick

02:30:28.271 --> 02:30:31.063
and very, very, very alive and tall.

02:30:32.791 --> 02:30:33.631
Not peering into it,

02:30:33.631 --> 02:30:36.891
but above it, you can see it is so dense

02:30:36.891 --> 02:30:40.091
that it gives this cloud blanket-like feel

02:30:40.091 --> 02:30:44.201
that seems to rise and roil with the landscape,

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:46.601
rising up over mountain ridges and over the edge.

02:30:46.601 --> 02:30:48.001
Some of them pushing up

02:30:48.001 --> 02:30:49.801
and causing these strange tower-like structures

02:30:49.801 --> 02:30:51.831
with certain trees that have the best view

02:30:51.831 --> 02:30:55.731
or best access to sustenance themselves grow much larger

02:30:55.731 --> 02:30:57.451
than all their surrounding elements.

02:30:57.451 --> 02:31:01.951
You do see, however, a clearing, a little further in,

02:31:01.951 --> 02:31:05.651
not quite at the base of the massive central volcano

02:31:05.651 --> 02:31:08.071
of Rumblecusp, where it gets its name,

02:31:08.071 --> 02:31:10.111
but on the path to that,

02:31:10.111 --> 02:31:12.569
on the southern side of the mountain.

02:31:13.911 --> 02:31:16.261
TRAVIS: And we're currently on
the eastern side of the mountain?

02:31:16.261 --> 02:31:18.391
MATT: You're on the southeastern side.
TRAVIS: Southeastern side.

02:31:18.391 --> 02:31:22.111
LIAM: Okay, so after experiencing that for a while,

02:31:22.111 --> 02:31:24.291
I come out of it, and I find Jester

02:31:24.291 --> 02:31:25.861
and relate it all to you.

02:31:25.861 --> 02:31:29.158
MATT: Did you want Frumpkin to
see what the clearing's about?

02:31:29.158 --> 02:31:30.261
LIAM: Oh, I thought you were done.

02:31:30.261 --> 02:31:31.094
Of course, I do.

02:31:31.094 --> 02:31:32.301
MATT: No.
LIAM: Yeah, I want us to spend 30

02:31:32.301 --> 02:31:33.651
or 40 minutes just watching.
ASHLEY: Yes, please.

02:31:33.651 --> 02:31:34.731
MATT: Yeah, so it's not a clearing as in, like,

02:31:34.731 --> 02:31:35.601
it's just an open land.

02:31:35.601 --> 02:31:36.621
You could just see part

02:31:36.621 --> 02:31:38.161
where the canopy just kid of falls away,

02:31:38.161 --> 02:31:42.151
except for a couple of (pops) little tufts of treetop there.

02:31:42.151 --> 02:31:44.661
As Frumpkin swoops in,

02:31:44.661 --> 02:31:48.921
the lingering mist gives way as he gets closer and closer,

02:31:48.921 --> 02:31:50.311
and where the mist begins to part,

02:31:50.311 --> 02:31:54.677
there, in this clearing,

02:31:54.677 --> 02:31:55.852
there is a village.

02:31:55.852 --> 02:31:56.901
SAM: Ooh!
LIAM: Ooh.

02:31:56.901 --> 02:31:58.681
MATT: There are about two dozen

02:31:58.681 --> 02:32:01.591
or more structures built across the ground,

02:32:01.591 --> 02:32:04.351
and some up into the tree canopies themselves,

02:32:04.351 --> 02:32:08.921
so you can see networks of ropes and other long pulleys

02:32:08.921 --> 02:32:11.811
and cords that are bound between trees at a distance,

02:32:11.811 --> 02:32:13.551
and there are buildings held aloft in them

02:32:13.551 --> 02:32:15.561
with bridges connecting.

02:32:15.561 --> 02:32:17.491
You can see elements of it that look like driftwood,

02:32:17.491 --> 02:32:19.131
elements that were carved from local trees,

02:32:19.131 --> 02:32:21.551
elements like pieces of ships that have been scavenged,

02:32:21.551 --> 02:32:24.111
and maybe, at this distant glance,

02:32:24.111 --> 02:32:25.301
what you peer through the mist,

02:32:25.301 --> 02:32:26.831
and you can only really see, like, the tops

02:32:26.831 --> 02:32:28.251
of the lower level of the village

02:32:28.251 --> 02:32:31.551
and a decent view of the ones that are higher up,

02:32:31.551 --> 02:32:34.901
amongst the trees, about maybe 50 or 60 feet off the ground,

02:32:34.901 --> 02:32:37.471
maybe a dozen or so humanoid figures,

02:32:37.471 --> 02:32:38.951
walking and traversing these bridges

02:32:38.951 --> 02:32:43.341
or within these small ramshackle buildings themselves.

02:32:43.341 --> 02:32:44.174
ASHLEY: Endor!

02:32:44.174 --> 02:32:46.691
LIAM: Any kind of descriptive features to the humanoids

02:32:46.691 --> 02:32:48.011
that I can--
MATT: Does Frumpkin want

02:32:48.011 --> 02:32:49.151
to get close enough to look?

02:32:49.151 --> 02:32:52.741
LIAM: I'll fly in, yeah.
MATT: Yeah, okay.

02:32:52.741 --> 02:32:53.574
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:32:53.574 --> 02:32:56.449
MATT: Getting close, Frumpkin notices

02:32:57.341 --> 02:32:59.001
it's an eclectic batch.

02:32:59.001 --> 02:33:02.859
You see a couple of

02:33:02.859 --> 02:33:04.900
suntanned humanoids,

02:33:04.900 --> 02:33:08.811
humans specifically, both men, different ages.

02:33:08.811 --> 02:33:11.261
You can see one has a very long, unkept beard.

02:33:11.261 --> 02:33:13.671
The other one looks older and has lost most of his hair,

02:33:13.671 --> 02:33:17.571
but they're both wearing clothes, where elements

02:33:17.571 --> 02:33:20.421
of it seem very what would have been nice clothes,

02:33:20.421 --> 02:33:22.931
anyone wandering the Menagerie Coast in Nicodranas

02:33:22.931 --> 02:33:25.411
or north of the empire, that are just,

02:33:25.411 --> 02:33:27.251
been tattered and worn, over time,

02:33:27.251 --> 02:33:30.731
and piecemealed with leathers

02:33:30.731 --> 02:33:33.621
and bits of dried palm frond.

02:33:34.561 --> 02:33:38.521
You can see another figure that appears to be elven,

02:33:38.521 --> 02:33:41.491
themself also sunburned to the point

02:33:41.491 --> 02:33:44.771
where it becomes a tanned leathery texture,

02:33:44.771 --> 02:33:46.021
their hair pulled back

02:33:46.021 --> 02:33:49.451
into a very, very a wild ponytail

02:33:49.451 --> 02:33:51.811
that puffs out the back of the head a bit

02:33:51.811 --> 02:33:54.381
and falls to almost mid-back.

02:33:54.381 --> 02:33:55.931
It would've been black hair,

02:33:55.931 --> 02:33:58.351
but you can see some of it's going gray.

02:33:58.351 --> 02:34:02.346
And you can see another figure that appears to be full orc,

02:34:02.346 --> 02:34:06.261
tall but relatively lithe for an orc

02:34:06.261 --> 02:34:11.161
who is wearing partially very rusted ring mail

02:34:11.161 --> 02:34:13.061
that part of it has fallen away,

02:34:13.061 --> 02:34:17.331
and it's been attached with other leathers

02:34:17.331 --> 02:34:21.761
that look rough cut and probably tanned, locally, and is

02:34:21.761 --> 02:34:25.521
in the process of giving out different directions,

02:34:25.521 --> 02:34:28.454
but they're all crafting,

02:34:28.454 --> 02:34:31.062
building, tanning.

02:34:31.062 --> 02:34:33.511
Many of these figures-- it looks like a small commune.

02:34:33.511 --> 02:34:36.401
LIAM: And it's the garb, the weathered garb

02:34:36.401 --> 02:34:40.861
of the Menagerie Coast, augmented with what I would theorize

02:34:40.861 --> 02:34:41.805
can be found here.
MATT: Some of it does.

02:34:41.805 --> 02:34:43.711
Some of it does, but the kind

02:34:43.711 --> 02:34:44.971
of clothing you would see there as opposed

02:34:44.971 --> 02:34:45.804
to in the middle of an island

02:34:45.804 --> 02:34:48.518
in the middle of nowhere is more the point.

02:34:48.518 --> 02:34:50.351
Some of it has a Menagerie Coast vibe.

02:34:50.351 --> 02:34:53.171
Some of it has another individual.

02:34:53.171 --> 02:34:57.571
The elf that you see has something that would almost be

02:34:58.886 --> 02:35:01.811
lower- to middle-class garb for the Empire.

02:35:01.811 --> 02:35:05.181
It all seems relatively sourceless

02:35:05.181 --> 02:35:07.341
or at least scattershot from its source,

02:35:07.341 --> 02:35:09.741
which means a lot of it could've been scavenged.

02:35:10.901 --> 02:35:11.841
It's hard to tell.

02:35:11.841 --> 02:35:12.931
LIAM: And it's a low-key day.

02:35:12.931 --> 02:35:16.751
People are just going about their lives here.

02:35:16.751 --> 02:35:17.584
MATT: It appears to be.

02:35:17.584 --> 02:35:18.421
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: From what you can make out

02:35:18.421 --> 02:35:20.201
at this distance and with the mist still kind

02:35:20.201 --> 02:35:24.951
of obscuring the lower regions of this village.

02:35:24.951 --> 02:35:28.761
LIAM: Okay, I will send Frumpkin away from here

02:35:28.761 --> 02:35:31.411
and send him up, up, up, up, up, up

02:35:31.411 --> 02:35:36.051
to the zenith of the volcano

02:35:36.051 --> 02:35:39.221
to try to see if there was anything to be seen inside.

02:35:39.221 --> 02:35:42.343
This will be my final task with Frumpkin.

02:35:42.343 --> 02:35:45.341
Is it just smoke billowing up from the center of the island?

02:35:46.381 --> 02:35:47.631
LIAM: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

02:35:47.631 --> 02:35:50.099
TRAVIS: (parched gasp)
LIAM: Come on, you cat.

02:35:50.099 --> 02:35:51.401
TRAVIS: (explosion)

02:35:51.401 --> 02:35:53.441
MARISHA: Right in the ash.

02:35:53.441 --> 02:35:54.761
LIAM: Eight.
MATT: Eight?

02:35:54.761 --> 02:35:56.261
LIAM: Eight.
MATT: Okay.

02:35:56.261 --> 02:35:57.101
MATT: He's losing altitude.

02:35:57.101 --> 02:35:58.405
He's losing-- aww.

02:35:58.405 --> 02:36:01.297
TRAVIS: (plane engine)

02:36:01.297 --> 02:36:03.423
MATT: Just (pops).

02:36:03.423 --> 02:36:05.201
It's like a bug zapper (crackles).

02:36:05.201 --> 02:36:06.034
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:36:06.034 --> 02:36:06.940
(laughter)

02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:09.621
LIAM: One hit point, is at one hit point, right now.

02:36:09.621 --> 02:36:11.541
MATT: No, Frumpkin does not get close enough to incinerate.

02:36:11.541 --> 02:36:14.431
But Frumpkin does get close enough to notice

02:36:14.431 --> 02:36:17.586
that there is, at the very point,

02:36:18.831 --> 02:36:19.701
and it is a point.

02:36:19.701 --> 02:36:21.561
There isn't a caldera that's visible.

02:36:22.501 --> 02:36:26.281
It looks like this island either hasn't erupted, previously,

02:36:26.281 --> 02:36:31.121
and is just a state of sustained volcanic activity.

02:36:31.121 --> 02:36:32.371
There is a bit of an orange glow

02:36:32.371 --> 02:36:35.581
where it looks like there is a faint magma trickle,

02:36:35.581 --> 02:36:39.149
near the very, very zenith of this mountain,

02:36:40.111 --> 02:36:42.651
where the smoke emerges, and there is an opening.

02:36:42.651 --> 02:36:44.641
There is a fissure of some kind

02:36:44.641 --> 02:36:46.761
where it is emerging from, but--

02:36:46.761 --> 02:36:49.778
LAURA: That's a zit that needs to be popped.

02:36:50.770 --> 02:36:51.994
TALIESIN: (groans)

02:36:51.994 --> 02:36:54.401
MATT: That's what Frumpkin makes out.

02:36:54.401 --> 02:36:55.888
TRAVIS: The magma zit.
LIAM: The Laura and Liam story.

02:36:55.888 --> 02:36:59.231
(sings Welcome To Jurassic Park)

02:36:59.231 --> 02:37:00.661
Okay, so I snap out of it.

02:37:00.661 --> 02:37:03.773
I call Frumpkin back, and I snap out of it and just,

02:37:05.671 --> 02:37:08.291
we are not the only ones here.

02:37:08.291 --> 02:37:09.731
LAURA: Yeah, I know the Traveler told me we have

02:37:09.731 --> 02:37:11.181
to fight something, probably.

02:37:12.231 --> 02:37:13.611
LIAM: Fight?

02:37:13.611 --> 02:37:15.720
LAURA: I don't know. He said there's dangerous things here.

02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:17.848
LIAM: Well, I saw some sort of a village

02:37:17.848 --> 02:37:21.761
with folk who look like they are not--

02:37:21.761 --> 02:37:24.504
possibly not from here, but living here.

02:37:26.091 --> 02:37:27.661
LAURA: Like castaways?

02:37:27.661 --> 02:37:28.631
LIAM: Maybe so.
LAURA: (gasps)

02:37:28.631 --> 02:37:30.931
Like shipwreck survivors?

02:37:30.931 --> 02:37:31.764
LIAM: Possibly, yeah.

02:37:31.764 --> 02:37:32.951
LAURA: Like, what if it's all the survivors

02:37:32.951 --> 02:37:34.911
from the dragon turtle attacks,

02:37:34.911 --> 02:37:37.251
and they all make their way here?

02:37:37.251 --> 02:37:39.571
What if they are the dragon's hoard?

02:37:39.571 --> 02:37:40.731
What if he downs the ships,

02:37:40.731 --> 02:37:42.581
and then he's like, here, you guys, stay over here.

02:37:42.581 --> 02:37:43.751
This island is mine.

02:37:43.751 --> 02:37:45.751
TALIESIN: I wonder if they have, like,
a self-help group or something.

02:37:45.751 --> 02:37:46.584
LAURA: Yeah.

02:37:46.584 --> 02:37:47.931
TALIESIN: That could be very convenient.

02:37:47.931 --> 02:37:50.341
LIAM: We should round up the others, and,

02:37:50.341 --> 02:37:53.221
I mean, we need to throw a party here, so--

02:37:53.221 --> 02:37:55.751
LAURA: Yeah, did you see a good place to throw the party?

02:37:55.751 --> 02:37:57.961
TRAVIS: What part of the island and how far away was it?

02:37:57.961 --> 02:38:01.411
LIAM: Well, up towards the slope of

02:38:01.411 --> 02:38:03.552
the volcano or the mountain,

02:38:03.552 --> 02:38:05.811
not right at the foot of it, but close.

02:38:05.811 --> 02:38:07.451
So we would have to travel up a bit.

02:38:07.451 --> 02:38:08.451
LAURA: The whole time we're talking--

02:38:08.451 --> 02:38:10.311
MATT: It's a number of miles to the northwest

02:38:10.311 --> 02:38:13.001
of the beach landing, you guys were at, so...

02:38:13.001 --> 02:38:15.371
LAURA: I'm using the green fabric.

02:38:15.371 --> 02:38:16.821
And I'm making a giant sign.

02:38:16.821 --> 02:38:19.651
I'm painting Traveler Con 3000 on it.

02:38:19.651 --> 02:38:20.484
MATT: Okay.

02:38:20.484 --> 02:38:24.244
LAURA: And I'm going to attach it to two big poles

02:38:24.244 --> 02:38:25.661
as a greeting banner.

02:38:25.661 --> 02:38:27.131
MATT: Okay, it'll take you a little while,

02:38:27.131 --> 02:38:29.181
but you begin the process of constructing that.

02:38:29.181 --> 02:38:30.014
LAURA: Yeah.

02:38:30.014 --> 02:38:31.888
TRAVIS: Make sure you poke holes in it, for air flow,

02:38:31.888 --> 02:38:32.721
the breeze--
SAM: The wind.

02:38:32.721 --> 02:38:34.513
TALIESIN: It'll get blown down, otherwise.

02:38:34.513 --> 02:38:36.181
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay, okay.
TALIESIN: With a little half circle thing.

02:38:36.181 --> 02:38:37.014
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

02:38:37.014 --> 02:38:38.111
ASHLEY: So they can (soft whoosh).

02:38:38.111 --> 02:38:40.241
MATT: An important lesson on aerodynamics is absorbed

02:38:40.241 --> 02:38:43.266
by Jester, and in doing so, the sign is improved.

02:38:44.805 --> 02:38:48.163
LAURA: So you were saying, Caleb, about people?

02:38:48.163 --> 02:38:52.521
LIAM: Just that I saw the type of clothes

02:38:52.521 --> 02:38:55.841
that we have seen in different parts of the world.

02:38:55.841 --> 02:38:58.491
I really have more questions than I have answers.

02:38:58.491 --> 02:39:00.383
Oh, that's fancy.

02:39:00.383 --> 02:39:02.241
More questions than I have answers.

02:39:02.241 --> 02:39:03.381
I don't know why these people are here,

02:39:03.381 --> 02:39:05.371
but they look like they'd been here a while.

02:39:05.371 --> 02:39:10.151
So before we throw the Fyre Festival here,

02:39:10.151 --> 02:39:11.421
maybe we need permission

02:39:11.421 --> 02:39:14.018
or at least an agreement with them.

02:39:15.001 --> 02:39:18.601
I doubt what you have in mind would go unnoticed.

02:39:18.601 --> 02:39:21.331
SAM: Should we send a group to sort of negotiate

02:39:21.331 --> 02:39:23.864
and introduce, or should we all go?

02:39:25.411 --> 02:39:26.491
TALIESIN: Good question.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:39:26.491 --> 02:39:28.633
LAURA: How hard is it to get to the people?

02:39:29.471 --> 02:39:31.371
LIAM: Well, it's up that way.

02:39:31.371 --> 02:39:34.476
I think it might take a day or so, yeah?

02:39:34.476 --> 02:39:36.071
TRAVIS: I think we should go together, yeah?

02:39:36.071 --> 02:39:38.951
MATT: Based on how dense the jungle appears to be

02:39:38.951 --> 02:39:41.791
and how tight the canopy was,

02:39:41.791 --> 02:39:46.131
even though it's maybe, you're surmising,

02:39:46.131 --> 02:39:47.511
anywhere from five to eight miles

02:39:47.511 --> 02:39:50.321
from where you currently are, travel will be slow.

02:39:50.321 --> 02:39:54.781
So we'll say half a day, if not more,

02:39:54.781 --> 02:39:56.931
based on what gets in your way.

02:39:56.931 --> 02:39:57.831
SAM: Let's go.

02:39:57.831 --> 02:39:58.851
TRAVIS: Yeah, together.

02:39:58.851 --> 02:40:00.971
LIAM: Look, a couple of people are out.

02:40:00.971 --> 02:40:01.941
SAM: No, we're back.

02:40:01.941 --> 02:40:03.231
LIAM: Oh, that's it, huh?

02:40:03.231 --> 02:40:04.331
SAM: We saw shit.

02:40:04.331 --> 02:40:05.561
MARISHA: Yeah, it was foggy,

02:40:05.561 --> 02:40:08.361
foggy day in the forest.
LIAM: I forgot how D&amp;D works.

02:40:08.361 --> 02:40:11.784
ASHLEY: How many people are expected to come?

02:40:11.784 --> 02:40:16.006
LAURA: I think it was around 200?

02:40:17.031 --> 02:40:19.751
20, maybe 20 people?
SAM: Did he give you a number?

02:40:19.751 --> 02:40:21.871
LAURA: I feel like he gave me a number a long time ago.

02:40:21.871 --> 02:40:23.976
MARISHA: In between 200 and 20?

02:40:25.251 --> 02:40:26.551
LAURA: Yeah, 20 to 200.

02:40:26.551 --> 02:40:27.428
MARISHA: To 200?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:40:27.428 --> 02:40:28.261
somewhere around there.
ASHLEY: Just so we know

02:40:28.261 --> 02:40:29.771
what kind of space--
LAURA: Depending on how many people

02:40:29.771 --> 02:40:31.414
don't die on the way here from

02:40:31.414 --> 02:40:32.431
the dragon turtle attack.
ASHLEY: Yeah, because

02:40:32.431 --> 02:40:33.991
the dragon turtle and what else?

02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:36.441
TRAVIS: The weather that was brewing off in one direction,

02:40:36.441 --> 02:40:38.351
that's not near us or moving towards us,

02:40:38.351 --> 02:40:39.591
the storm that was moving in--

02:40:39.591 --> 02:40:40.881
MATT: No, that was heading southward.

02:40:40.881 --> 02:40:42.971
It passed over.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:40:42.971 --> 02:40:45.181
Relatively clear, middle of the day?

02:40:45.181 --> 02:40:47.061
MATT: Yeah, actually.
TRAVIS: Awesome, okay.

02:40:47.061 --> 02:40:49.811
TALIESIN: Perhaps, like, some people should set up

02:40:49.811 --> 02:40:53.191
some emergency stuff here, and then if it's all good,

02:40:53.191 --> 02:40:55.071
at this village, we could just bring everybody.

02:40:55.071 --> 02:40:58.001
Maybe they have an inn or something.

02:40:58.001 --> 02:41:00.181
LAURA: Did you see a doorway to the volcano at all?

02:41:00.181 --> 02:41:01.431
Like, can we go in it?

02:41:01.431 --> 02:41:02.391
TALIESIN: A restaurant?

02:41:02.391 --> 02:41:04.911
LIAM: I saw a fissure.

02:41:04.911 --> 02:41:06.301
LAURA: A fish area?

02:41:06.301 --> 02:41:07.931
LIAM: Yeah, a fish-- no.

02:41:07.931 --> 02:41:09.651
SAM: A fissure, a fissure.
TALIESIN: Like a lake?

02:41:09.651 --> 02:41:11.921
LIAM: You know, we have been
traveling together for a long time.

02:41:11.921 --> 02:41:14.951
I though you would have gotten used to my accent by now,

02:41:14.951 --> 02:41:19.121
but a crack, a hole.

02:41:19.121 --> 02:41:20.301
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Oh!

02:41:20.301 --> 02:41:21.401
LIAM: Like a urethra.

02:41:21.401 --> 02:41:22.831
LAURA: Oh!
LIAM: To the--

02:41:22.831 --> 02:41:23.701
TRAVIS: To the penis.

02:41:23.701 --> 02:41:26.011
MARISHA: Oh, a fissure.

02:41:26.011 --> 02:41:27.441
LAURA: See?
LIAM: That's what I said, yeah?

02:41:27.441 --> 02:41:28.274
LAURA: Beau knows.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:41:28.274 --> 02:41:29.107
LIAM: A fissure, a fissure.
TALIESIN: Oh!

02:41:29.107 --> 02:41:29.940
LIAM: A fish area.

02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:31.431
MARISHA: Well, yeah, a fish area, yeah.

02:41:31.431 --> 02:41:32.264
TRAVIS: Like a tip.

02:41:33.511 --> 02:41:35.061
LIAM: No, not like a tit.

02:41:35.061 --> 02:41:37.503
TRAVIS: No, a tip, with a p.

02:41:37.503 --> 02:41:38.421
(laughter)

02:41:38.421 --> 02:41:41.514
LAURA: Wow.
LIAM: Hey, we play games here.

02:41:43.951 --> 02:41:45.611
SAM: People aren't supposed to arrive for a week.

02:41:45.611 --> 02:41:48.351
Let's just take our half-day journey into the jungle

02:41:48.351 --> 02:41:49.184
and meet these people.

02:41:49.184 --> 02:41:50.041
LAURA: We'll figure it out.

02:41:50.041 --> 02:41:51.811
We should at least let them know that a lot

02:41:51.811 --> 02:41:52.911
of people could be on their way here.

02:41:52.911 --> 02:41:53.771
SAM: That's right.

02:41:53.771 --> 02:41:55.991
LIAM: And unlike the turtle,

02:41:55.991 --> 02:42:00.331
maybe we don't throw fireballs or vortexes at them.

02:42:00.331 --> 02:42:01.681
TALIESIN: No.
LIAM: We just walk in.

02:42:01.681 --> 02:42:02.591
TRAVIS: Yes.
SAM: Yeah.

02:42:02.591 --> 02:42:04.741
TRAVIS: Or at least observe first, reconnaissance,

02:42:04.741 --> 02:42:07.231
and then we decide, yeah?

02:42:07.231 --> 02:42:08.064
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: If they look

02:42:08.064 --> 02:42:11.171
like they have a community, then I'm sure it'll be fine.

02:42:11.171 --> 02:42:12.571
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Maybe they're looking

02:42:12.571 --> 02:42:16.351
to boost tourism in the area.

02:42:16.351 --> 02:42:18.971
This could be a good thing for the local economy.

02:42:18.971 --> 02:42:19.804
SAM: Yeah, that's true.

02:42:19.804 --> 02:42:21.431
LAURA: Yeah, we can trade with them.

02:42:21.431 --> 02:42:24.241
TALIESIN: Maybe they've been looking
for a way off the island.

02:42:24.241 --> 02:42:25.074
MARISHA: Oh!
TRAVIS: They'll just kill us

02:42:25.074 --> 02:42:26.261
and take our ship.
SAM: Or we can give them--

02:42:26.261 --> 02:42:27.094
TALIESIN: I mean,

02:42:27.094 --> 02:42:28.191
that would be an attempt.
SAM: We can give them things

02:42:28.191 --> 02:42:30.121
in exchange for their hospitality.

02:42:30.121 --> 02:42:31.141
SAM: Yeah, we got stuff.

02:42:31.141 --> 02:42:32.361
TRAVIS: Let's go!
MARISHA: What do we have?

02:42:32.361 --> 02:42:33.971
Hang on.
TRAVIS: Let's go into the jungle!

02:42:33.971 --> 02:42:35.981
MARISHA: While we walk, what do we have?

02:42:35.981 --> 02:42:37.411
TALIESIN: Winning personalities.
SAM: Cannonballs.

02:42:37.411 --> 02:42:38.244
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:42:38.244 --> 02:42:39.721
MATT: All right, in the interim, Orly and the rest

02:42:39.721 --> 02:42:41.901
of the crew set up there encampment on the beach there

02:42:41.901 --> 02:42:43.581
to help keep an eye on the ship,

02:42:43.581 --> 02:42:45.811
to also keep an eye for anybody

02:42:45.811 --> 02:42:47.851
who also is traveling inward, to the islands.

02:42:47.851 --> 02:42:49.751
LAURA: Hey, Orly!

02:42:49.751 --> 02:42:50.971
MATT: "(grunts)"

02:42:50.971 --> 02:42:54.029
LAURA: If you see a big dragon
turtle coming to attack everything,

02:42:54.029 --> 02:42:57.001
play your bagpipes, okay, because they're really loud.

02:42:58.671 --> 02:43:02.838
MATT: "I'll take that as a compliment (sniffs).

02:43:03.881 --> 02:43:05.207
"Stay safe."

02:43:05.207 --> 02:43:06.341
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:43:06.341 --> 02:43:07.881
LAURA: You, too.

02:43:07.881 --> 02:43:09.831
MATT: As you guys begin to head into the jungle,

02:43:09.831 --> 02:43:13.081
you can hear the classic warmup sound of

02:43:13.081 --> 02:43:16.247
(bagpipe honks).

02:43:16.247 --> 02:43:18.010
Yeah, it's great.

02:43:18.010 --> 02:43:20.097
TRAVIS: That was better than your war horn.

02:43:20.097 --> 02:43:21.810
TALIESIN: You got to get a little bagpipe in.

02:43:21.810 --> 02:43:23.281
(laughter)

02:43:23.281 --> 02:43:25.161
MATT: Look, as a Scotsman, I can't fuck up my bagpipes.

02:43:25.161 --> 02:43:27.494
(laughter)

02:43:31.321 --> 02:43:33.881
Almost immediately, upon entering the jungle,

02:43:33.881 --> 02:43:37.776
the density of the vine tangle is impressive.

02:43:38.691 --> 02:43:41.981
The shaded canopy of the trees is already climbing 100

02:43:41.981 --> 02:43:45.401
or more feet into the air, which is further shattered

02:43:45.401 --> 02:43:48.011
by the network of intertwining vines that seems

02:43:48.011 --> 02:43:50.721
to cluster into the branches above

02:43:50.721 --> 02:43:53.171
and create, like, a net web,

02:43:53.171 --> 02:43:56.351
multiple layers, throughout this jungle,

02:43:56.351 --> 02:44:00.061
beyond just this open beneath-canopy.

02:44:00.061 --> 02:44:01.831
The air begins to slowly shift

02:44:01.831 --> 02:44:04.861
from the salty sea air into a sweet,

02:44:04.861 --> 02:44:09.761
earthy scent of lush vegetation, a damp ground,

02:44:09.761 --> 02:44:13.773
and, occasionally, you see little colorful flowers,

02:44:13.773 --> 02:44:15.941
orange and purple in color,

02:44:15.941 --> 02:44:18.421
that seem to be growing where the canopy begins

02:44:18.421 --> 02:44:21.141
to break up a bit, and a bit of light begins to make its way

02:44:21.141 --> 02:44:22.789
to the jungle floor.
TALIESIN: Hey.

02:44:22.789 --> 02:44:23.764
LAURA: Yasha, Yasha.

02:44:23.764 --> 02:44:25.529
TALIESIN: You guys are real pretty.

02:44:25.529 --> 02:44:28.121
I'm assuming you're probably safe.

02:44:28.121 --> 02:44:29.581
We're not going to disturb you or anything,

02:44:29.581 --> 02:44:31.781
but yeah, if you got a thing,

02:44:31.781 --> 02:44:33.511
we'd appreciate if you didn't--

02:44:33.511 --> 02:44:34.344
TRAVIS: Yasha might.

02:44:34.344 --> 02:44:36.571
TALIESIN: -- I don't know, eat us.

02:44:36.571 --> 02:44:39.021
We're just going to try and leave you to your thing.

02:44:39.861 --> 02:44:42.311
LAURA: Caduceus, will you ask if it's okay

02:44:42.311 --> 02:44:44.578
if Yasha takes some flowers?

02:44:46.721 --> 02:44:48.922
TALIESIN: Would it be all right if--

02:44:48.922 --> 02:44:49.791
I don't know.

02:44:49.791 --> 02:44:51.316
Well--

02:44:51.316 --> 02:44:53.057
No polite way to--

02:44:54.079 --> 02:44:55.541
SAM: Can we kill some of you?
ASHLEY: I never thought about

02:44:55.541 --> 02:44:58.241
picking flowers as a bad thing,

02:44:58.241 --> 02:44:59.331
but when you talk to plants,

02:44:59.331 --> 02:45:00.951
it makes me feel a little funny.

02:45:00.951 --> 02:45:04.781
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, they grow back,

02:45:04.781 --> 02:45:06.371
so it's more of just--

02:45:06.371 --> 02:45:08.161
LAURA: It's like hair or fingernails.

02:45:08.161 --> 02:45:08.994
LAURA: It's more like hair.

02:45:08.994 --> 02:45:09.871
TRAVIS: Aww, you're pulling their fingernails out.

02:45:09.871 --> 02:45:12.161
SAM: Like picking fingernails off of somebody.

02:45:12.161 --> 02:45:14.361
TALIESIN: Would it be all right if we just took one,

02:45:15.621 --> 02:45:18.351
just to remember you by?

02:45:18.351 --> 02:45:23.351
MATT: You gather the nearby trees and foliage heard you.

02:45:23.351 --> 02:45:24.975
TALIESIN: Yep, I don't know.

02:45:24.975 --> 02:45:25.911
TRAVIS: Heard you.

02:45:25.911 --> 02:45:28.311
MARISHA: Technically, it's like picking their genitals.

02:45:28.311 --> 02:45:29.144
LAURA: What?

02:45:29.144 --> 02:45:30.471
Whoa.
SAM: (laughs)

02:45:30.471 --> 02:45:31.471
MARISHA: It's-- what?

02:45:31.471 --> 02:45:32.431
That's science.

02:45:32.431 --> 02:45:33.601
I am not--
LAURA: No!

02:45:33.601 --> 02:45:34.434
TRAVIS: You're pickin' a testes.

02:45:34.434 --> 02:45:35.267
TALIESIN: Never thought of it that way.

02:45:35.267 --> 02:45:36.771
MARISHA: That's how they have sex!
TRAVIS: Picking a pube.

02:45:36.771 --> 02:45:37.891
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: I did not want

02:45:37.891 --> 02:45:41.811
to say it out loud, but it is a bit like pubic hair.

02:45:41.811 --> 02:45:43.521
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: But that's fine.

02:45:43.521 --> 02:45:44.991
It's like trimming a pubic hair.

02:45:44.991 --> 02:45:46.371
That's all, Yasha.
SAM: What on earth

02:45:46.371 --> 02:45:48.001
are you people talking about?

02:45:48.001 --> 02:45:49.931
MARISHA: Picking flowers!

02:45:49.931 --> 02:45:51.273
Clearly!

02:45:51.273 --> 02:45:53.911
MATT: Look, The Dwendalian public school system,

02:45:53.911 --> 02:45:55.541
unfortunately, was lost on--

02:45:55.541 --> 02:45:56.551
LIAM: That is just science, Veth.

02:45:56.551 --> 02:45:57.384
MARISHA: That's high-level shit.

02:45:57.384 --> 02:45:59.041
TRAVIS: Not a lot of sexual awareness--
ASHLEY: I'm going to pick one

02:45:59.041 --> 02:46:01.051
of the flowers.
TRAVIS: -- in the Dwendalian Empire.

02:46:01.051 --> 02:46:01.911
MATT: Which one?

02:46:01.911 --> 02:46:03.671
There is an orange variety

02:46:03.671 --> 02:46:05.391
that are about that large or so,

02:46:05.391 --> 02:46:07.161
and there are a handful, you can see

02:46:07.161 --> 02:46:08.841
as you begin this travel, of purple,

02:46:08.841 --> 02:46:10.671
that are a little larger

02:46:10.671 --> 02:46:13.481
and anchored independently at the base

02:46:13.481 --> 02:46:14.314
of a few of these trees.

02:46:14.314 --> 02:46:15.261
SAM: The purple ones are really nice.

02:46:15.261 --> 02:46:17.376
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MARISHA: Purple ones are rare.

02:46:17.376 --> 02:46:19.311
ASHLEY: I mean, I really wanted to go for a purple one,

02:46:19.311 --> 02:46:21.189
but that one feels like a--

02:46:21.189 --> 02:46:22.141
I'm going to pick a purple one.

02:46:22.141 --> 02:46:23.071
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:46:23.071 --> 02:46:23.931
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

02:46:23.931 --> 02:46:24.871
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know.

02:46:24.871 --> 02:46:26.421
I know what's coming.

02:46:26.421 --> 02:46:27.901
LIAM: Ah!

02:46:27.901 --> 02:46:30.601
MATT: You walk over and reach towards the base

02:46:30.601 --> 02:46:32.246
of this purple flower.

02:46:32.246 --> 02:46:35.001
(laughter)

02:46:35.001 --> 02:46:37.821
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- one more time,
I'm going to use a charisma bonus.

02:46:37.821 --> 02:46:40.504
Please don't do anything terrible to us.

02:46:40.504 --> 02:46:41.658
I'm so sorry.

02:46:41.658 --> 02:46:43.341
I'm going to attempt

02:46:43.341 --> 02:46:46.251
to influence the flower not to do something.

02:46:46.251 --> 02:46:48.421
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Cup the base!

02:46:48.421 --> 02:46:50.231
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:46:50.231 --> 02:46:52.011
TALIESIN: So I have advantage on this.

02:46:52.011 --> 02:46:55.411
LIAM: This group has been so horny for D&amp;D,

02:46:55.411 --> 02:46:57.581
for three months.

02:46:57.581 --> 02:47:01.881
TALIESIN: Make a persuasion check, okay.

02:47:01.881 --> 02:47:03.422
22!
MATT: The dental dam is burst.

02:47:03.422 --> 02:47:04.672
(laughter)

02:47:04.672 --> 02:47:08.071
TALIESIN: 22.
MATT: 22, okay.

02:47:08.071 --> 02:47:10.041
ASHLEY: I very gently cup underneath.

02:47:10.041 --> 02:47:12.161
MATT: Right, right, and as you give it--

02:47:12.161 --> 02:47:12.994
TRAVIS: One hand or two?

02:47:12.994 --> 02:47:14.789
MATT: You give it just a little tug.

02:47:15.738 --> 02:47:18.201
ASHLEY: When I feel some resistance, I put another hand.

02:47:18.201 --> 02:47:19.681
MATT: Okay, and you know what?

02:47:19.681 --> 02:47:21.991
ASHLEY: It really comforts the pulling.

02:47:21.991 --> 02:47:23.687
MATT: It pops right off.

02:47:23.687 --> 02:47:26.811
(giggling)

02:47:26.811 --> 02:47:28.181
ASHLEY: Great.
TRAVIS: No endurance.

02:47:28.181 --> 02:47:30.591
TALIESIN: It usually takes a lot longer.

02:47:30.591 --> 02:47:33.791
MATT: You have effectively deflowered the plant.

02:47:33.791 --> 02:47:36.241
But you have this beautiful purple flower.

02:47:36.241 --> 02:47:40.986
ASHLEY: I'll mark the deflowering
down in my book of many-- yeah.

02:47:40.986 --> 02:47:42.801
TALIESIN: The book of conquests.
ASHLEY: Book of conquests.

02:47:42.801 --> 02:47:45.381
SAM: Does it smell good?
MATT: Three months.

02:47:45.381 --> 02:47:48.835
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, how does it smell?

02:47:48.835 --> 02:47:49.668
SAM: Musky?

02:47:49.668 --> 02:47:51.198
MARISHA: (giggles)

02:47:51.198 --> 02:47:55.181
MATT: No, this smells very saccharine-sweet.

02:47:55.181 --> 02:47:56.861
In fact, smelling very closely to it,

02:47:56.861 --> 02:47:58.474
I would like you to make a wisdom saving throw.

02:47:58.474 --> 02:47:59.381
LAURA: Oh!

02:47:59.381 --> 02:48:01.583
TALIESIN: Yep.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

02:48:03.171 --> 02:48:04.621
SAM: Guidance!

02:48:06.591 --> 02:48:07.627
MATT: You have no idea this is happening.

02:48:07.627 --> 02:48:09.277
SAM: I don't have Guidance.

02:48:09.277 --> 02:48:10.161
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:48:10.161 --> 02:48:10.994
TRAVIS: Shout it out.

02:48:10.994 --> 02:48:12.401
ASHLEY: Let's do this one.
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

02:48:12.401 --> 02:48:13.754
I was waiting for this.

02:48:17.941 --> 02:48:18.774
ASHLEY: Nine.

02:48:18.774 --> 02:48:19.671
LAURA: Oh!
MATT: Nine?

02:48:19.671 --> 02:48:21.081
ALL: <i>Nein</i>!

02:48:21.081 --> 02:48:22.222
MATT: Okay.

02:48:22.222 --> 02:48:26.555
You smell this very sweet,

02:48:29.338 --> 02:48:32.438
floral honey smell to it.
ASHLEY: This smells so good.

02:48:32.438 --> 02:48:35.521
MATT: And you immediately feel your mouth salivating,

02:48:35.521 --> 02:48:37.131
and your stomach begin to gurgle,

02:48:37.131 --> 02:48:39.281
and you compulsively find yourself--

02:48:39.281 --> 02:48:40.701
and you all watch as Yasha begins

02:48:40.701 --> 02:48:43.261
to stuff this freshly-picked purple flower

02:48:43.261 --> 02:48:44.094
into her mouth.

02:48:44.094 --> 02:48:44.941
TALIESIN: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:48:44.941 --> 02:48:47.061
I'm going to try and-- oh, no.

02:48:47.061 --> 02:48:48.211
MARISHA: Does she always do that?

02:48:48.211 --> 02:48:49.311
SAM: She eats weird shit.

02:48:49.311 --> 02:48:50.231
She eats rats.

02:48:50.231 --> 02:48:52.001
MARISHA: Is this a Xhorhas thing?

02:48:52.001 --> 02:48:53.541
MATT: As you go and try and pull it out,

02:48:53.541 --> 02:48:55.711
she animalistically pulls away

02:48:55.711 --> 02:48:56.791
and continues to chew.

02:48:56.791 --> 02:48:57.624
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

02:48:57.624 --> 02:48:58.471
SAM: No, that's fine.

02:48:58.471 --> 02:48:59.901
She just likes eating weird shit.

02:48:59.901 --> 02:49:00.821
LAURA: Yasha, don't eat it!

02:49:00.821 --> 02:49:03.154
SAM: She's mostly animal.

02:49:03.154 --> 02:49:04.471
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw for me, Yasha.

02:49:04.471 --> 02:49:06.081
ASHLEY: Oh no.

02:49:06.081 --> 02:49:07.595
Okay.

02:49:07.595 --> 02:49:08.478
LAURA: Uh-oh.

02:49:10.511 --> 02:49:11.811
This is how we die.

02:49:11.811 --> 02:49:13.344
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh.

02:49:13.344 --> 02:49:14.451
21.

02:49:14.451 --> 02:49:15.284
MATT: 21.

02:49:17.441 --> 02:49:22.151
As you devour a part of this flower, it smells great.

02:49:22.151 --> 02:49:26.361
The flavor is very ashy and unpleasant, bitter,

02:49:26.361 --> 02:49:28.861
and the flower petals seems to crumble

02:49:28.861 --> 02:49:33.861
in your gullet, and this burning sensation begins

02:49:33.901 --> 02:49:36.431
to take from the inside of your throat

02:49:36.431 --> 02:49:39.681
and inside your chest.

02:49:39.681 --> 02:49:41.411
You resist it, though.

02:49:41.411 --> 02:49:43.671
You're used to eating harsh things

02:49:43.671 --> 02:49:46.831
in the wastes of Xhorhas to survive, and you manage

02:49:46.831 --> 02:49:49.172
to shrug off

02:49:49.172 --> 02:49:53.201
what may have been a more terrible experience.

02:49:53.201 --> 02:49:55.361
Right now, you're just suffering indigestion.

02:49:55.361 --> 02:49:57.371
ASHLEY: It has a little bit of spice to it,

02:49:57.371 --> 02:49:59.929
but the top note smelled

02:49:59.929 --> 02:50:02.120
like it was going to be a lot sweeter than it was.

02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:03.001
SAM: Do you recommend it?

02:50:03.001 --> 02:50:03.851
Is it worth it?

02:50:04.731 --> 02:50:06.161
ASHLEY: I mean, I thought it was delicious.

02:50:06.161 --> 02:50:08.441
I think you should try it.

02:50:10.111 --> 02:50:12.291
TALIESIN: I'm going to vote no on that.

02:50:12.291 --> 02:50:13.291
That seems a--

02:50:13.291 --> 02:50:14.791
LIAM: You are sweating a little bit.

02:50:15.781 --> 02:50:18.511
MARISHA: Yeah, you got, like, hives.

02:50:18.511 --> 02:50:19.821
Some red.

02:50:19.821 --> 02:50:21.011
TALIESIN: There's some gunk coming out.

02:50:21.011 --> 02:50:23.181
MARISHA: Just a little.
ASHLEY: I got a little color?

02:50:23.181 --> 02:50:24.014
MARISHA: Just a little, yeah.

02:50:24.014 --> 02:50:26.387
LIAM: It's your nodes.
MARISHA: I think it's more prominent,

02:50:26.387 --> 02:50:27.661
because you're so pale.
TALIESIN: Kind of violet, yeah.

02:50:27.661 --> 02:50:28.921
ASHLEY: Oh, a little violet?

02:50:28.921 --> 02:50:30.701
TALIESIN: Yeah, it looks like a swelling.

02:50:30.701 --> 02:50:33.441
TRAVIS: Did you manage to salvage any of the flower,

02:50:33.441 --> 02:50:34.961
or did you eat all of it?

02:50:34.961 --> 02:50:35.794
ASHLEY: I couldn't.

02:50:35.794 --> 02:50:38.531
It was such an overwhelmingly good smell.

02:50:38.531 --> 02:50:41.161
I had to consume the whole thing.

02:50:41.161 --> 02:50:42.041
TRAVIS: You had to eat that shit.

02:50:42.041 --> 02:50:45.261
LAURA: Can I go down and look at the stem of the flower?

02:50:45.261 --> 02:50:46.371
Is there any of that, like,

02:50:46.371 --> 02:50:48.161
you know how some flowers have white stuff

02:50:48.161 --> 02:50:50.721
that comes out of the stem when you pick it?

02:50:50.721 --> 02:50:52.001
MATT: Yeah.

02:50:52.001 --> 02:50:53.431
LAURA: Can I look and see if it has any

02:50:53.431 --> 02:50:54.871
of that white stuff coming out?

02:50:54.871 --> 02:50:55.799
MATT: Sure.

02:50:55.799 --> 02:50:57.778
(laughter)

02:50:57.778 --> 02:50:58.611
ASHLEY: He's writing it down, like, "uh..."

02:50:58.611 --> 02:50:59.531
LAURA: I'm not trying to be dirty.

02:50:59.531 --> 02:51:01.371
I'm literally talking about, like, dandelions.

02:51:01.371 --> 02:51:03.041
MATT: No, I know what you're talking about.

02:51:03.041 --> 02:51:05.146
You're just also Laura Bailey, so we all assume.

02:51:05.146 --> 02:51:06.951
(laughter)

02:51:06.951 --> 02:51:09.651
SAM: Does the purple shaft have white stuff coming out

02:51:09.651 --> 02:51:10.484
of end of it?

02:51:10.484 --> 02:51:11.317
(laughter)

02:51:11.317 --> 02:51:12.998
TRAVIS: What if we shake it?

02:51:14.141 --> 02:51:14.974
MATT: It does not.

02:51:14.974 --> 02:51:16.596
LAURA: It doesn't.
MATT: No.

02:51:16.596 --> 02:51:20.236
LIAM: This is three months of pent-up frustration.

02:51:21.127 --> 02:51:23.201
ASHLEY: Ah, but I want a flower for my book.

02:51:23.201 --> 02:51:24.391
LAURA: Go pick another one.

02:51:24.391 --> 02:51:25.471
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab the orange one.

02:51:25.471 --> 02:51:26.641
LAURA: Just don't smell it.
MATT: Okay.

02:51:26.641 --> 02:51:27.901
LAURA: Keep it away from your face, Yasha.

02:51:27.901 --> 02:51:30.091
SAM: What is a flower for, if not to smell?

02:51:30.091 --> 02:51:31.661
LAURA: To dry and put it in your book.

02:51:31.661 --> 02:51:33.591
TALIESIN: Certainly not to eat.
LIAM: Or appreciate growing

02:51:33.591 --> 02:51:34.981
in the wild.

02:51:34.981 --> 02:51:36.051
MATT: Okay, you pluck the orange one.

02:51:36.051 --> 02:51:37.671
LIAM: Then eat it.
MATT: It is smaller.

02:51:38.859 --> 02:51:40.611
It doesn't seem to react

02:51:40.611 --> 02:51:42.371
to the plucking.
SAM: Eat it!

02:51:42.371 --> 02:51:44.584
TALIESIN: Don't eat the-- no.

02:51:44.584 --> 02:51:46.141
ASHLEY: I'm going to press it into my book.

02:51:46.141 --> 02:51:47.311
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: And I'm going to close it.

02:51:47.311 --> 02:51:49.331
TRAVIS: How is the general fog of the area,

02:51:49.331 --> 02:51:51.841
that we saw from outside the treeline?

02:51:51.841 --> 02:51:54.171
MATT: The mist is--
TRAVIS: The mist.

02:51:54.171 --> 02:51:56.621
MATT: It's not so thick where you lose visibility

02:51:56.621 --> 02:51:59.321
in 10 feet or all, but like--

02:51:59.321 --> 02:52:02.451
Honestly, the dangling vines are more of a worry,

02:52:02.451 --> 02:52:04.511
as far as visibility than the mist itself.

02:52:04.511 --> 02:52:07.151
The mist really only becomes an issue,

02:52:07.151 --> 02:52:10.341
obscuring about 30 to 40 feet from where you are.

02:52:10.341 --> 02:52:12.481
It begins to really make things a little hard,

02:52:12.481 --> 02:52:15.161
beyond shapes and elements of light

02:52:15.161 --> 02:52:18.381
that do manage to come through, beneath the canopy.

02:52:18.381 --> 02:52:22.671
SAM: As a scientist, I'm going to take two clippings

02:52:22.671 --> 02:52:24.871
of two more of those purple flowers,

02:52:24.871 --> 02:52:27.021
just to take back with us.

02:52:27.021 --> 02:52:29.521
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:52:29.521 --> 02:52:31.201
Mark it down.

02:52:31.201 --> 02:52:34.499
You have purple flower clippings from Rumblecusp.

02:52:35.431 --> 02:52:37.531
SAM: Great.

02:52:37.531 --> 02:52:40.201
MARISHA: Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah?

02:52:41.209 --> 02:52:45.241
MARISHA: Doesn't fog normally burn
off at a certain time of day?

02:52:45.241 --> 02:52:47.841
Or does this feel right to you?

02:52:47.841 --> 02:52:50.651
TRAVIS: The marine layer should've dissipated by this point.

02:52:50.651 --> 02:52:52.951
TALIESIN: I mean, I appreciate that you're asking me that,

02:52:52.951 --> 02:52:54.761
but I think this may have been one of the first couple

02:52:54.761 --> 02:52:56.261
of islands I've ever been on,

02:52:56.261 --> 02:52:57.821
and we don't really have

02:52:57.821 --> 02:53:01.391
whatever marine layer--
MARISHA: Landlocked, yeah.

02:53:01.391 --> 02:53:02.861
TALIESIN: Mist, I don't know.

02:53:02.861 --> 02:53:04.361
I mean, there's a volcano, too.

02:53:04.361 --> 02:53:05.207
I don't know if that affects things.

02:53:05.207 --> 02:53:06.345
TRAVIS: Doesn't feel quite right.

02:53:06.345 --> 02:53:11.345
I mean, perhaps, it's some sort of geothermal activity.

02:53:12.031 --> 02:53:13.091
It's not normal.

02:53:13.091 --> 02:53:14.441
MARISHA: That's a good point, though.

02:53:14.441 --> 02:53:15.941
Can I do, like, a quick scan?

02:53:15.941 --> 02:53:19.561
Do I see any type of fissures leaking

02:53:19.561 --> 02:53:21.691
through the jungle or anything?

02:53:21.691 --> 02:53:23.041
LIAM: On the sides of the volcano?
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:53:23.041 --> 02:53:24.961
TALIESIN: Does the mist have a scent?

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:26.161
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say.

02:53:26.161 --> 02:53:28.381
MATT: Yeah, if you're glancing around the vicinity.

02:53:30.817 --> 02:53:33.533
MARISHA: Goddamn it, fucking balls. Nine.

02:53:33.533 --> 02:53:34.421
MATT: Nine.
MARISHA: Nine.

02:53:34.421 --> 02:53:37.551
MATT: You don't see anything that resembles that sort

02:53:37.551 --> 02:53:42.454
of a geothermal activity, as Fjord was saying.

02:53:42.454 --> 02:53:45.961
TALIESIN: Does the mist have a scent or a taste, the air?

02:53:45.961 --> 02:53:49.069
MATT: The air still has that earthy

02:53:51.156 --> 02:53:56.156
combination of sweet decomposition meets wet dirt and earth,

02:53:56.156 --> 02:53:59.222
but nothing--
TALIESIN: There's no sulfur in the mist?

02:53:59.222 --> 02:54:00.511
MATT: No, no sulfur in the air, no.

02:54:00.511 --> 02:54:01.591
This is not Rotorua.

02:54:01.591 --> 02:54:04.411
LIAM: And it's real damn hot, right?

02:54:04.411 --> 02:54:07.411
MATT: It's pretty warm, especially at this point in the day.

02:54:07.411 --> 02:54:09.361
The canopy gives you shade, which helps.

02:54:09.361 --> 02:54:11.011
The beach itself is a lot hotter.

02:54:12.171 --> 02:54:15.391
And the mist doesn't make it more humid.

02:54:15.391 --> 02:54:20.391
It's helping cool the interior of the shaded canopy.

02:54:20.811 --> 02:54:23.781
TALIESIN: Is the ground warm?

02:54:23.781 --> 02:54:24.631
MATT: The ground is not warm.

02:54:24.631 --> 02:54:26.211
TALIESIN: All right, well, that's good.

02:54:26.211 --> 02:54:28.101
TRAVIS: Can I fire off a Divine Sense

02:54:28.101 --> 02:54:30.711
and just check 60 feet around us?

02:54:30.711 --> 02:54:32.101
MATT: Yeah.

02:54:32.101 --> 02:54:33.721
You take a moment to concentrate

02:54:33.721 --> 02:54:38.211
and take in the presence of your surroundings.

02:54:38.211 --> 02:54:40.491
Nothing catches your mind.

02:54:40.491 --> 02:54:42.091
TRAVIS: Celestial, fiend, or undead.

02:54:42.091 --> 02:54:42.924
Okay.

02:54:44.151 --> 02:54:45.091
SAM: So paranoid.

02:54:45.091 --> 02:54:46.181
TRAVIS: Good to carry on?

02:54:46.181 --> 02:54:48.551
SAM: Yeah, of course, we're just walking through the woods.

02:54:48.551 --> 02:54:49.431
MATT: It's hard to shake,

02:54:49.431 --> 02:54:51.221
but since you've entered here,

02:54:51.221 --> 02:54:55.151
and you've all been shrugging it off independently,

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:58.221
but you all start looking to each other,

02:54:58.221 --> 02:55:01.781
there's a nervousness in
your stomach you can't quite explain.

02:55:01.781 --> 02:55:05.311
There's a sense, and you catch other members

02:55:05.311 --> 02:55:06.451
of your party occasionally

02:55:06.451 --> 02:55:08.451
quickly looking over their shoulders,

02:55:09.521 --> 02:55:13.438
and there's an element of feeling like you're being watched,

02:55:14.291 --> 02:55:16.676
but you see nothing watching you.

02:55:25.161 --> 02:55:26.251
SAM: We're fine.

02:55:26.251 --> 02:55:28.001
We're fine!
LAURA: Fine.

02:55:28.001 --> 02:55:29.671
SAM: Let's just keep going.
LAURA: We just had to go say hi

02:55:29.671 --> 02:55:31.821
to these people.
SAM: That's right,

02:55:31.821 --> 02:55:32.991
the people in the woods.

02:55:32.991 --> 02:55:34.541
MARISHA: What if they hate us?

02:55:34.541 --> 02:55:35.631
SAM: How could you hate us?

02:55:35.631 --> 02:55:36.464
TRAVIS: Do you hate us?

02:55:36.464 --> 02:55:37.991
TALIESIN: We are pretty charming.

02:55:37.991 --> 02:55:40.251
MARISHA: Of course not, no, I'm just--

02:55:40.251 --> 02:55:44.609
I also know how we present,

02:55:44.609 --> 02:55:46.578
which is assholes, sometimes.

02:55:46.578 --> 02:55:47.411
TRAVIS: That's true.

02:55:47.411 --> 02:55:48.961
LIAM: How long have we been traveling, at this point,

02:55:48.961 --> 02:55:50.391
towards this village?

02:55:50.391 --> 02:55:53.171
MATT: You've only been but an hour into the jungle.

02:55:53.171 --> 02:55:54.751
You still have quite a ways of travel.

02:55:54.751 --> 02:55:57.041
LIAM: And we thought half a day to a whole day to get there?

02:55:57.041 --> 02:55:58.411
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: All right.

02:55:58.411 --> 02:55:59.749
LAURA: Oy.

02:55:59.749 --> 02:56:03.791
I'm going to leave a Traveler statue on the ground.

02:56:03.791 --> 02:56:04.624
MATT: Okay.

02:56:04.624 --> 02:56:08.148
LAURA: I'm going to leave a little
trail of Traveler statues as we walk.

02:56:08.148 --> 02:56:09.814
MATT: You got it, you got it.

02:56:09.814 --> 02:56:11.391
Can I get a marching order as you guys continue

02:56:11.391 --> 02:56:13.391
to push further into the jungle, please?

02:56:14.281 --> 02:56:16.241
LIAM: I'll take the middle of the line.

02:56:16.241 --> 02:56:17.411
MATT: All right, we have--

02:56:17.411 --> 02:56:19.821
LIAM: Because I have 70-something hit points.

02:56:19.821 --> 02:56:20.831
SAM: I'll take point.

02:56:20.831 --> 02:56:23.241
MARISHA: I'll be behind Veth.
MATT: All right, you have Veth taking point.

02:56:23.241 --> 02:56:27.521
We have Beauregard, along with, pardon me, along with Veth.

02:56:27.521 --> 02:56:29.671
TRAVIS: I'll be behind Beauregard.

02:56:29.671 --> 02:56:31.481
ASHLEY: I'll take the back.

02:56:31.481 --> 02:56:34.121
LAURA: I'll be between Caleb and Yasha.

02:56:34.121 --> 02:56:35.651
LIAM: So it's Veth, Beauregard, Fjord?

02:56:35.651 --> 02:56:36.591
MATT: Caduceus?

02:56:36.591 --> 02:56:38.531
TALIESIN: I'll be behind Yasha.

02:56:38.531 --> 02:56:39.601
LIAM: Right now, I would be behind Fjord.

02:56:39.601 --> 02:56:42.101
TALIESIN: Whichever is far enough away from Jester.

02:56:42.101 --> 02:56:44.661
MATT: Okay, so we'll put you at the back then.

02:56:44.661 --> 02:56:45.494
LAURA: Right.

02:56:45.494 --> 02:56:46.981
MATT: Okay, so we have Caduceus at the back,

02:56:46.981 --> 02:56:51.973
then Yasha, then Jester, Caleb, Fjord, Beau, and Veth.

02:56:53.181 --> 02:56:55.931
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave, for fun, just popping it on

02:56:55.931 --> 02:56:57.591
for a second.
MATT: Yeah, no worries.

02:56:57.591 --> 02:57:00.421
You take a moment and focus on your surroundings.

02:57:00.421 --> 02:57:02.911
You sense the color of the world drop for a moment,

02:57:02.911 --> 02:57:07.031
as you tune into the essence of undeath around you.

02:57:07.031 --> 02:57:08.311
And as your eyes open--

02:57:09.601 --> 02:57:10.661
and Yasha, you see this.

02:57:10.661 --> 02:57:11.494
It's the first time you've

02:57:11.494 --> 02:57:14.277
really watched Caduceus

02:57:14.277 --> 02:57:16.860
going into this brief mode,

02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:20.031
but the eyes are black.

02:57:20.031 --> 02:57:23.491
And then he blinks and have returned to normal.

02:57:23.491 --> 02:57:24.551
Nothing catches your attention.

02:57:24.551 --> 02:57:25.401
TALIESIN: All right.

02:57:25.401 --> 02:57:26.621
ASHLEY: Wow.

02:57:26.621 --> 02:57:28.151
TALIESIN: Nothing undead.

02:57:28.151 --> 02:57:29.771
Just keeping an eye out.

02:57:29.771 --> 02:57:31.841
ASHLEY: Your eyes just went completely black.

02:57:31.841 --> 02:57:32.674
TALIESIN: Oh, like this?

02:57:32.674 --> 02:57:33.939
Thaumaturgy.

02:57:33.939 --> 02:57:36.487
ASHLEY: (gasps)

02:57:36.487 --> 02:57:38.111
I don't know how I haven't noticed that before,

02:57:38.111 --> 02:57:39.091
but that's very cool.

02:57:39.091 --> 02:57:42.106
TALIESIN: Yeah, watch this. Purple, red, green, yellow.

02:57:42.106 --> 02:57:43.751
(laughter)

02:57:43.751 --> 02:57:46.178
TALIESIN: Rave.
(fingers snapping)

02:57:46.178 --> 02:57:47.245
SAM: (electronic dance beat)

02:57:47.245 --> 02:57:48.626
LIAM: Just Taliesin changing his hair.

02:57:48.626 --> 02:57:49.842
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:57:51.171 --> 02:57:53.281
MATT: Beauregard, you're the first to notice.

02:57:53.281 --> 02:57:56.421
within this second hour of travel pushing

02:57:56.421 --> 02:57:59.481
through this jungle. There are times where,

02:57:59.481 --> 02:58:01.251
as you're leading the troop, Veth, you have

02:58:01.251 --> 02:58:03.401
to pull out your dagger and cut through.

02:58:03.401 --> 02:58:05.341
The vines are just too dense.

02:58:05.341 --> 02:58:09.651
And there's no clear path or previously walked avenues here

02:58:09.651 --> 02:58:12.281
that would be easier to traverse.

02:58:12.281 --> 02:58:16.101
You begin to notice signs of footprints

02:58:16.101 --> 02:58:19.081
in some of the lower troughs between the bases

02:58:19.081 --> 02:58:22.061
of these heavy, rooted trees.

02:58:22.061 --> 02:58:23.581
MARISHA: What kind of footprints?

02:58:23.581 --> 02:58:27.421
MATT: Some look beast-like, though you can't quite,

02:58:27.421 --> 02:58:29.271
at a glance, make out the shape.

02:58:29.271 --> 02:58:31.601
They are large and the gait seems

02:58:31.601 --> 02:58:36.601
to be multiple footprints in a walking pattern.

02:58:38.098 --> 02:58:41.051
MARISHA: Just animal/beast tracks or--

02:58:41.051 --> 02:58:42.131
MATT: Make a nature check.

02:58:42.131 --> 02:58:44.711
MARISHA: -- animal with humanoid-- okay.

02:58:44.711 --> 02:58:46.543
Nature check?

02:58:46.543 --> 02:58:47.851
MATT: Just to see if you recognize--

02:58:47.851 --> 02:58:49.084
LIAM: Dubstep.

02:58:50.261 --> 02:58:52.081
MARISHA: 13.
MATT: 13.

02:58:54.031 --> 02:58:58.521
The tracks you see are not deep,

02:58:58.521 --> 02:59:01.301
and you can't quite make out what type of creature,

02:59:01.301 --> 02:59:04.611
but you assume, based on the faint claw marks

02:59:04.611 --> 02:59:07.931
and the lightness of their pressure, based on the size,

02:59:07.931 --> 02:59:10.791
that they're probably some sort of predatory creature.

02:59:10.791 --> 02:59:11.624
MARISHA: Okay.

02:59:13.016 --> 02:59:13.849
MATT: A little ways forward,

02:59:13.849 --> 02:59:15.561
you do see some humanoid footprints.

02:59:17.211 --> 02:59:18.451
MARISHA: Okay.

02:59:18.451 --> 02:59:19.311
MATT: And because you're at the front,

02:59:19.311 --> 02:59:23.073
and you have a really high passive perception,

02:59:24.211 --> 02:59:27.931
you also notice, in one of the tree trunks,

02:59:27.931 --> 02:59:31.191
you can see some carvings to the right,

02:59:31.191 --> 02:59:32.441
as you push forward.

02:59:32.441 --> 02:59:37.231
MARISHA: Using my background, do I recognize it

02:59:37.231 --> 02:59:40.531
as a cant of some sort or any type of, like, communication?

02:59:40.531 --> 02:59:42.051
MATT: It is not a particular language,

02:59:42.051 --> 02:59:44.051
but the marking is deliberate,

02:59:44.051 --> 02:59:48.411
and it looks like a circle with a dot in the center

02:59:48.411 --> 02:59:51.381
and a line in one direction, and it's pointing

02:59:51.381 --> 02:59:53.311
in the direction you guys are traveling.

02:59:53.311 --> 02:59:55.541
And because of your high passive investigation,

02:59:55.541 --> 02:59:59.041
you surmise that these are markings used

02:59:59.041 --> 03:00:00.661
by anyone who traverses these jungles,

03:00:00.661 --> 03:00:02.911
probably from the village that Caleb was mentioning,

03:00:02.911 --> 03:00:04.621
to ensure that if they ever get lost,

03:00:04.621 --> 03:00:06.741
it can guide them in the direction to get home.

03:00:07.781 --> 03:00:09.092
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

03:00:09.092 --> 03:00:12.259
TRAVIS: So we go the other way (laughs).

03:00:12.259 --> 03:00:13.619
MATT: Fjord, great on the water,

03:00:13.619 --> 03:00:16.326
a little shifty on land. (laughs)

03:00:16.326 --> 03:00:18.461
SAM: Yeah, Beau,

03:00:18.461 --> 03:00:21.391
Beau, I'm grateful for you noticing all this stuff,

03:00:21.391 --> 03:00:24.211
but I'm taking point, so I mean--

03:00:24.211 --> 03:00:27.665
MARISHA: Well, I'm behind you, and you're so short,

03:00:27.665 --> 03:00:28.498
so I can just see--
SAM: I know, but you're just kind

03:00:28.498 --> 03:00:30.111
of making me look like an asshole a little.

03:00:30.111 --> 03:00:31.191
MARISHA: Well, no, you were--

03:00:31.191 --> 03:00:33.651
SAM: You're seeing everything.

03:00:33.651 --> 03:00:34.851
And I'm not seeing anything.

03:00:34.851 --> 03:00:39.631
MARISHA: My successes don't deter from you as a person.

03:00:39.631 --> 03:00:42.873
SAM: I just feel like a failure, a little bit.

03:00:42.873 --> 03:00:45.141
MARISHA: Don't compare yourself
to me. It's an impossible task.

03:00:45.141 --> 03:00:45.974
LIAM: Are we there yet?

03:00:45.974 --> 03:00:47.461
(laughter)

03:00:47.461 --> 03:00:48.931
MATT: While they're having this conversation,

03:00:48.931 --> 03:00:52.361
Caleb, you're listening to this, but looking

03:00:52.361 --> 03:00:55.771
around your surroundings, and you can glance up,

03:00:55.771 --> 03:00:57.811
in that larger netted canopy

03:00:57.811 --> 03:00:59.981
of vines and branches that entwine

03:00:59.981 --> 03:01:04.981
and create these small tethered pathways,

03:01:05.131 --> 03:01:08.361
too thin perhaps for a heavier creature

03:01:08.361 --> 03:01:10.231
to traverse, but you glance up,

03:01:10.231 --> 03:01:15.111
and you can see a shadowed shape,

03:01:15.111 --> 03:01:16.541
pressed against one of the trees,

03:01:16.541 --> 03:01:19.561
chest curving around upon one of these,

03:01:19.561 --> 03:01:21.141
with these faintly glowing eyes,

03:01:21.141 --> 03:01:23.608
just peering down, straight at you.

03:01:27.245 --> 03:01:29.401
LIAM: Do they seem like eyes as large as my own

03:01:29.401 --> 03:01:31.011
or something smaller than my own?

03:01:31.011 --> 03:01:32.211
MATT: Larger that yours.

03:01:33.121 --> 03:01:33.954
LIAM: Okay.

03:01:33.954 --> 03:01:35.901
SAM: I'm just saying, you should let me notice something

03:01:35.901 --> 03:01:37.481
every once in a while.

03:01:37.481 --> 03:01:38.511
MARISHA: Okay, well, you know what?

03:01:38.511 --> 03:01:40.671
You can help me with these tracks.

03:01:40.671 --> 03:01:41.971
Do you know how to--

03:01:41.971 --> 03:01:43.601
SAM: I don't know anything about animals.

03:01:43.601 --> 03:01:44.911
MARISHA: Well, what do you got?
LAURA: I'm going to go up

03:01:44.911 --> 03:01:46.461
to the cant that Beau found,

03:01:46.461 --> 03:01:49.156
and I'm just going to add a couple more lines.

03:01:49.156 --> 03:01:52.814
(laughter)

03:01:52.814 --> 03:01:56.781
TRAVIS: Fucking trickster ass cleric!

03:01:56.781 --> 03:01:58.033
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:01:58.033 --> 03:02:00.441
MARISHA: Just switching the street signs, yeah (laughs).

03:02:00.441 --> 03:02:01.274
TRAVIS: Oh man!

03:02:01.274 --> 03:02:02.107
LIAM: Hold on a moment.

03:02:02.107 --> 03:02:05.091
MATT: You're a terrible person.
LIAM: My shoelace has come untied.

03:02:05.091 --> 03:02:09.619
And I pull a small copper wire out, and I say to Veth,

03:02:09.619 --> 03:02:12.791
yeah, okay, there are things in the trees.

03:02:12.791 --> 03:02:13.731
We are not alone.

03:02:13.731 --> 03:02:15.511
MARISHA: I mean, I'm just saying
you can pull your own weight.

03:02:15.511 --> 03:02:17.501
SAM: I noticed something.

03:02:17.501 --> 03:02:18.971
I just noticed something.

03:02:18.971 --> 03:02:19.804
MARISHA: Oh really?

03:02:19.804 --> 03:02:22.718
SAM: Yep, I noticed something in the trees.

03:02:22.718 --> 03:02:24.521
LAURA: Did you say it that loud?

03:02:24.521 --> 03:02:25.416
TRAVIS: Yes.
SAM: Yep.

03:02:25.416 --> 03:02:26.841
Ah!

03:02:26.841 --> 03:02:28.181
MATT: Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah?

03:02:28.181 --> 03:02:29.541
MATT: At this point, you're watching this thing,

03:02:29.541 --> 03:02:30.851
and, Caduceus, as you guys have traversed,

03:02:30.851 --> 03:02:32.351
you pick up on this thing, too.

03:02:32.351 --> 03:02:33.184
TALIESIN: Oh boy!

03:02:33.184 --> 03:02:35.424
MATT: You see what looks to be a--

03:02:36.421 --> 03:02:38.321
it's hard to make out the defined shape,

03:02:38.321 --> 03:02:40.101
because the moment you glance up and notice it,

03:02:40.101 --> 03:02:42.971
it shifts and notices you

03:02:42.971 --> 03:02:45.731
getting a clock on it, and it curves around,

03:02:45.731 --> 03:02:48.201
behind the tree, out of sight.

03:02:48.201 --> 03:02:49.381
But then you also both hear,

03:02:49.381 --> 03:02:50.411
and, Beauregard, you hear this, too,

03:02:50.411 --> 03:02:53.771
you hear the sound (thumps) of two sets

03:02:53.771 --> 03:02:58.461
of light feet hitting the ground from behind that tree.

03:02:58.461 --> 03:03:00.011
MARISHA: Okay, we're being stalked.

03:03:00.011 --> 03:03:00.881
TALIESIN: I'm just going to say--

03:03:00.881 --> 03:03:01.714
SAM: You're welcome.

03:03:01.714 --> 03:03:03.380
TALIESIN: We're--
MARISHA: (sputters) What?

03:03:03.380 --> 03:03:05.051
TALIESIN: We're not here to hurt anybody,

03:03:05.051 --> 03:03:06.851
and if you just let us go on our way.

03:03:06.851 --> 03:03:09.661
We're just heading our way.

03:03:09.661 --> 03:03:10.691
We won't be trouble.
TRAVIS: Are you saying that

03:03:10.691 --> 03:03:11.851
to the trees again?

03:03:11.851 --> 03:03:13.551
TALIESIN: I'm saying it to anything that's listening.

03:03:13.551 --> 03:03:17.451
LIAM: I pull out a small, clay,

03:03:19.021 --> 03:03:21.471
pyramid-shaped statue that I have,

03:03:21.471 --> 03:03:23.271
with little glyphs and characters all over it,

03:03:23.271 --> 03:03:26.661
and I cast Tongues on myself.

03:03:26.661 --> 03:03:27.494
SAM: Ooh.

03:03:27.494 --> 03:03:28.327
MATT: All right.

03:03:28.327 --> 03:03:30.341
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

03:03:30.341 --> 03:03:31.466
MATT: Okay.

03:03:32.453 --> 03:03:36.516
(whooshes) Secondary Jester appears to the right side.

03:03:36.516 --> 03:03:39.631
You cast Tongues on yourself.
TALIESIN: I love that.

03:03:39.631 --> 03:03:41.279
MARISHA: Everyone maybe--
SAM: Can everyone [inaudible]?

03:03:42.871 --> 03:03:45.101
TRAVIS: We saw, like, a monkey in the trees,

03:03:45.101 --> 03:03:47.361
and all of a sudden, we're on full fucking lockdown.

03:03:47.361 --> 03:03:50.391
I don't know why.
TALIESIN: I don't think that was a--

03:03:50.391 --> 03:03:52.041
LIAM: Oh goodness.
MARISHA: I think it's got claws.

03:03:52.041 --> 03:03:56.521
LIAM: I think that we are almost to the village

03:03:56.521 --> 03:03:58.751
that I caught wind of.

03:03:58.751 --> 03:04:01.151
I'm saying out loud, and anything

03:04:01.151 --> 03:04:03.611
that can hear me can understand me right now.

03:04:03.611 --> 03:04:05.091
I hope we can find somewhere

03:04:05.091 --> 03:04:07.284
to rest peacefully for the night.

03:04:08.901 --> 03:04:10.521
MARISHA: Yeah, no, that was always the goal.

03:04:10.521 --> 03:04:11.808
LAURA: Yeah, Caleb,

03:04:11.808 --> 03:04:12.641
that's what we want to do.
MARISHA: You didn't have to like

03:04:12.641 --> 03:04:13.474
state that to us.

03:04:13.474 --> 03:04:15.341
TRAVIS: I think he's, you know--

03:04:15.341 --> 03:04:16.174
MARISHA: Oh!

03:04:17.061 --> 03:04:21.461
ASHLEY: (stilted) Yes, just a place to rest so nicely.

03:04:21.461 --> 03:04:22.541
MATT: Okay--
TALIESIN: It may not--

03:04:22.541 --> 03:04:23.442
TRAVIS: Yasha, you also have Tongues?

03:04:23.442 --> 03:04:25.771
MATT: Caleb, Caduceus, Beauregard--

03:04:25.771 --> 03:04:27.021
ASHLEY: Shit.
MATT: -- the three of you guys

03:04:27.021 --> 03:04:29.429
now see, from around

03:04:29.429 --> 03:04:33.681
that trunk of that tree, where that entity was,

03:04:33.681 --> 03:04:35.931
the shape leaps to another tree

03:04:35.931 --> 03:04:37.391
and comes around the corner,

03:04:37.391 --> 03:04:39.546
thinking that it's out of sight,

03:04:40.701 --> 03:04:44.441
but still visible, and a second pair of eyes now appears

03:04:44.441 --> 03:04:46.151
to the right side of you.

03:04:46.151 --> 03:04:49.161
And you hear this faint (growls).

03:04:49.161 --> 03:04:49.994
TALIESIN: Oh, oh!

03:04:49.994 --> 03:04:51.521
MARISHA: It might have us surrounded.
LAURA: Clever girl.

03:04:51.521 --> 03:04:53.691
MARISHA: There might be multiple--
TALIESIN: Guys, I really wouldn't.

03:04:53.691 --> 03:04:55.291
You don't know what you're getting into.

03:04:55.291 --> 03:04:59.491
LIAM: Yeah, hello, we are not here to pick any fights.

03:04:59.491 --> 03:05:01.941
We are just trying to get by.

03:05:01.941 --> 03:05:03.811
MATT: You can see this--
LIAM: So perhaps step out,

03:05:03.811 --> 03:05:05.591
and we could just discuss this.

03:05:05.591 --> 03:05:08.171
MATT: -- this large black panther-like creature begins

03:05:08.171 --> 03:05:09.991
to emerge from the shadows,

03:05:09.991 --> 03:05:13.491
with these two additional lengthy tentacle-like appendages

03:05:13.491 --> 03:05:14.831
that curl.
LIAM: No.

03:05:14.831 --> 03:05:16.241
MATT: Its image (whooshes)--
LIAM: No, Matthew.

03:05:16.241 --> 03:05:17.632
MATT: Kind of distorts slightly.
MARISHA: Oh no!

03:05:17.632 --> 03:05:19.061
Oh!
TRAVIS: No.

03:05:19.061 --> 03:05:20.011
LAURA: Oh no!

03:05:20.011 --> 03:05:20.861
LIAM: Those are not humanoids.

03:05:20.861 --> 03:05:22.311
MARISHA: Oh, kitties.

03:05:22.311 --> 03:05:23.241
MATT: They are not humanoids.

03:05:23.241 --> 03:05:24.074
LIAM: No.

03:05:24.074 --> 03:05:25.713
MATT: And you see a second one now,

03:05:25.713 --> 03:05:27.671
coming around from that initial growl sound.

03:05:27.671 --> 03:05:29.249
LIAM: It's been a long time

03:05:29.249 --> 03:05:30.661
since Campaign One.
LIAM: And a third one begin

03:05:30.661 --> 03:05:31.931
to come from behind.

03:05:31.931 --> 03:05:32.764
LAURA: Uh-oh!

03:05:32.764 --> 03:05:34.941
MATT: They've surrounded you, at this point.

03:05:34.941 --> 03:05:37.522
MATT: As you guys begin to look amongst them.
SAM: Clever girl.

03:05:37.522 --> 03:05:39.834
LIAM: Meow!
LAURA: Clever girl!

03:05:39.834 --> 03:05:41.241
MARISHA: All right.

03:05:41.241 --> 03:05:42.271
MATT: They're not attacking yet.

03:05:42.271 --> 03:05:46.171
They're just slowly closing the circle.

03:05:46.171 --> 03:05:48.651
MARISHA: So they're, okay, all right.

03:05:48.651 --> 03:05:50.461
TRAVIS: Who's got a big display, hmm?

03:05:50.461 --> 03:05:54.531
Something that looks big and loud and dangerous?

03:05:54.531 --> 03:05:55.921
MARISHA: I still have firecrackers.
LIAM: No!

03:05:55.921 --> 03:05:57.871
SAM: There's Fluffernutter.
LIAM: No, no, no, no.

03:05:57.871 --> 03:05:59.774
LAURA: I've got quasit chunks.

03:05:59.774 --> 03:06:02.231
I'm going to pull them out and throw them.

03:06:02.231 --> 03:06:05.121
MARISHA: I'm going to light a firecracker and throw it, too.

03:06:05.121 --> 03:06:06.001
SAM: Oh boy.

03:06:06.001 --> 03:06:09.151
LAURA: All right, you watch quasit chunks (air whooshing),

03:06:09.151 --> 03:06:11.684
and they (snorts).

03:06:11.684 --> 03:06:13.840
(air whooshing, sputtering)

03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:15.288
(snarling)

03:06:15.288 --> 03:06:16.121
TRAVIS: Cool, cool!

03:06:16.121 --> 03:06:17.781
LAURA: Oh, why, Beau?
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:06:17.781 --> 03:06:19.491
MATT: Right at this point,

03:06:19.491 --> 03:06:23.289
you hear this earth-shattering roar, from out of nowhere.

03:06:23.289 --> 03:06:26.841
(roaring, booming)

03:06:26.841 --> 03:06:28.951
Heavy footfalls getting louder and louder.

03:06:28.951 --> 03:06:29.784
TRAVIS: What?

03:06:29.784 --> 03:06:30.731
MATT: You see the creatures shift over

03:06:30.731 --> 03:06:32.101
and look to the right side.

03:06:32.101 --> 03:06:35.951
As suddenly a shape, a blur of fur and muscle

03:06:35.951 --> 03:06:38.661
and rock seems to just slam out of the side of the jungle.

03:06:38.661 --> 03:06:41.581
You see a flash of a reflective light

03:06:41.581 --> 03:06:44.921
or metal just (hisses) streak across the middle of the air,

03:06:44.921 --> 03:06:47.961
and you watch as one of these panther creatures (shrieks)

03:06:47.961 --> 03:06:51.601
screams out in pain, as it backs away, itself

03:06:51.601 --> 03:06:53.081
leaving a trail of blood.

03:06:53.081 --> 03:06:55.161
You all look around and see this massive,

03:06:55.161 --> 03:06:57.566
like massive, bear.

03:06:57.566 --> 03:07:00.590
(growling)

03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:02.751
MARISHA: Well, we took care of the cat problem.

03:07:02.751 --> 03:07:07.181
MATT: The bear, bipedal and holding on to what looks

03:07:07.181 --> 03:07:10.731
to be a massive great ax, as it withdraws,

03:07:10.731 --> 03:07:12.681
and swings a second time.

03:07:12.681 --> 03:07:14.671
As it goes towards and strikes the same creature,

03:07:14.671 --> 03:07:16.291
the creature (whooshes) shifts out of the way

03:07:16.291 --> 03:07:17.586
and was in the wrong place.

03:07:17.586 --> 03:07:19.481
(roars) Rushes forward

03:07:19.481 --> 03:07:20.931
and it's not paying attention to you guys.

03:07:20.931 --> 03:07:24.101
It is just going to town on this one displacer beast.

03:07:24.101 --> 03:07:25.221
One strike after another,

03:07:25.221 --> 03:07:26.221
as the creature's trying to attack.

03:07:26.221 --> 03:07:28.061
Its tentacles whipping out and hitting it.

03:07:28.061 --> 03:07:28.894
Are you guys just watching?

03:07:28.894 --> 03:07:29.727
TRAVIS: No, let's fucking

03:07:29.727 --> 03:07:30.747
get in there!
LAURA: Go help him!

03:07:30.747 --> 03:07:31.580
MARISHA: Go, go, let's go, let's go.

03:07:31.580 --> 03:07:33.151
LAURA: The bear is carrying a weapon!

03:07:33.151 --> 03:07:35.331
TRAVIS: Are there two other displacer beasts now?

03:07:35.331 --> 03:07:37.623
MATT: You go and look, and they've scattered.

03:07:38.501 --> 03:07:39.951
TRAVIS: The displacer beasts have scattered?

03:07:39.951 --> 03:07:41.331
MATT: The other two are just (whooshes).

03:07:41.331 --> 03:07:43.571
They're rushing off and have vanished into the jungle.

03:07:43.571 --> 03:07:47.271
There is this one now, a second bear-like creature,

03:07:47.271 --> 03:07:48.701
comes rushing out of the side

03:07:48.701 --> 03:07:51.096
of where the displacer beast is backing into,

03:07:51.096 --> 03:07:52.661
and immediately just grabs it

03:07:52.661 --> 03:07:56.601
and (crunches) tears its head off its shoulders.

03:07:56.601 --> 03:07:59.261
As you guys are all preparing to engage in this,

03:07:59.261 --> 03:08:01.611
you can see the one displacer beast now lies limp

03:08:01.611 --> 03:08:05.451
on the ground, and these two hulking bipedal bears just kind

03:08:05.451 --> 03:08:08.201
of stand there (pants).

03:08:08.201 --> 03:08:09.311
TRAVIS: Maybe do your Tongue shit.

03:08:09.311 --> 03:08:10.579
LIAM: Thank you.
LAURA: That was amazing!

03:08:10.579 --> 03:08:12.004
MATT: The larger of the two turns around.

03:08:12.004 --> 03:08:13.761
(roars)

03:08:13.761 --> 03:08:14.951
TALIESIN: Anybody need a heal?

03:08:14.951 --> 03:08:17.232
LIAM: Speaking through Tongues,

03:08:17.232 --> 03:08:18.351
thank you.

03:08:18.351 --> 03:08:21.261
We have just arrived, and we are strangers here,

03:08:21.261 --> 03:08:23.611
and you have just saved our lives, and we would like

03:08:23.611 --> 03:08:25.668
to repay the favor.

03:08:25.668 --> 03:08:28.043
LAURA: Tell them they're really cool looking.

03:08:28.043 --> 03:08:29.361
LIAM: They know that.
MATT: You watch as their bear form

03:08:29.361 --> 03:08:32.627
seems to shimmer for a second before it begins to shrink--

03:08:32.627 --> 03:08:34.481
TRAVIS and LAURA: (gasp)
MATT: -- and slightly withdraw,

03:08:34.481 --> 03:08:39.424
and left in its place, you see a half-elf female form,

03:08:41.071 --> 03:08:45.751
muscular, built like a barrel, or a keg, if you will,

03:08:45.751 --> 03:08:50.531
but elven, with patches of hair

03:08:50.531 --> 03:08:54.291
across their body, amongst tattered leathers,

03:08:54.291 --> 03:08:57.471
a pair of standard, nice, tailored pants

03:08:57.471 --> 03:09:01.281
that are like just torn and dirty as fuck.

03:09:01.281 --> 03:09:04.611
The elf woman has these muttonchops

03:09:04.611 --> 03:09:06.781
that come down to the edge of the chin,

03:09:06.781 --> 03:09:08.601
very uncommon for an elf.

03:09:09.761 --> 03:09:13.851
The other bear is halting in the other side,

03:09:13.851 --> 03:09:18.541
smaller than the elven bear, begins to slowly revert

03:09:18.541 --> 03:09:20.631
to, and you know see, a humanoid man,

03:09:20.631 --> 03:09:23.691
younger, baby-faced, though also very muscular,

03:09:23.691 --> 03:09:27.251
in torso and arms, shirtless but just covered

03:09:27.251 --> 03:09:30.441
in heavy, thick patches of wiry hair,

03:09:30.441 --> 03:09:32.411
toss the axe to the ground and go,

03:09:34.161 --> 03:09:35.711
"Well, thank you for distracting him.

03:09:35.711 --> 03:09:37.963
"At least, it helped us get one kill."

03:09:37.963 --> 03:09:39.352
LAURA: (gasps) You--

03:09:39.352 --> 03:09:40.401
TALIESIN: That was really cool.

03:09:40.401 --> 03:09:41.775
SAM: Whoa!

03:09:41.775 --> 03:09:43.471
LAURA: Are you here for Traveler Con, too?

03:09:43.471 --> 03:09:45.551
SAM: (laughs) I don't think so.

03:09:47.021 --> 03:09:48.891
MATT: "What's Traveler Con?"

03:09:48.891 --> 03:09:50.381
And the elf woman goes,

03:09:50.381 --> 03:09:51.881
"Don't worry about him.

03:09:51.881 --> 03:09:56.151
"He's, uh, well, he--

03:09:56.151 --> 03:09:59.171
"Hmm. He's a nice guy.

03:09:59.171 --> 03:10:00.004
"Who are you?

03:10:00.004 --> 03:10:02.251
"What are you doing here?"

03:10:02.251 --> 03:10:03.421
SAM: Is she speaking Common?

03:10:03.421 --> 03:10:05.311
MATT: She's speaking Common, yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:10:05.311 --> 03:10:06.341
LAURA: Well--
SAM: Hi!

03:10:07.431 --> 03:10:08.771
MARISHA: We're The Mighty Nein.

03:10:10.041 --> 03:10:10.874
MATT: "All right."

03:10:10.874 --> 03:10:13.701
LIAM: We've been on the island for less than a day.

03:10:13.701 --> 03:10:16.971
MATT: "Oh, welcome, welcome, we're happy to have you."

03:10:16.971 --> 03:10:17.891
SAM: Oh.

03:10:17.891 --> 03:10:21.741
LIAM: Are you from the village we are aware of,

03:10:21.741 --> 03:10:23.521
further up the way?

03:10:23.521 --> 03:10:24.971
MATT: "We both are."

03:10:24.971 --> 03:10:27.111
And then he goes, "That's true.

03:10:27.111 --> 03:10:29.371
"Have you come to join us, as well?"

03:10:29.371 --> 03:10:32.211
SAM: Join, join, join the village?

03:10:32.211 --> 03:10:35.522
TRAVIS: How long have you been a part of this village?

03:10:35.522 --> 03:10:37.131
MATT: And they both look at each other.

03:10:38.531 --> 03:10:40.351
(as man) "As far as I can remember.

03:10:40.351 --> 03:10:42.099
"What about you?"

03:10:42.099 --> 03:10:46.231
(as woman) "A long time, a few years at least, I think."

03:10:46.231 --> 03:10:48.871
TRAVIS: And were you stranded, shipwrecked,

03:10:48.871 --> 03:10:50.741
on this island, and you all came together,

03:10:50.741 --> 03:10:53.301
or was it an intentional community

03:10:53.301 --> 03:10:56.091
that you started?
LAURA: Have you always been bears?

03:10:56.091 --> 03:10:56.924
MATT: They both look at each other

03:10:56.924 --> 03:10:58.081
and chuckle for a minute.

03:10:58.081 --> 03:10:59.721
(as man) "We've both been bears."

03:11:02.151 --> 03:11:04.621
And you can see the guy scratches this bite mark

03:11:04.621 --> 03:11:06.611
on his shoulder and goes, "Well, I mean,

03:11:06.611 --> 03:11:10.031
"I wasn't originally, but, you know,

03:11:10.031 --> 03:11:13.201
"some circumstance get out of hand."

03:11:13.201 --> 03:11:16.171
TALIESIN: Where are you from, originally, out of curiosity?

03:11:16.171 --> 03:11:17.202
MATT: As you're asking these questions,

03:11:17.202 --> 03:11:19.911
they're both now starting to take the displacer beast

03:11:19.911 --> 03:11:22.191
and tie its legs up and find a local branch

03:11:22.191 --> 03:11:25.591
to get it ready for travel
and bringing it back to the village.

03:11:25.591 --> 03:11:27.566
SAM: Maybe we could help you.
ASHLEY: You need any help?

03:11:27.566 --> 03:11:31.141
I can take that for you and carry it.

03:11:31.141 --> 03:11:32.761
MATT: "I mean, you're welcome to.

03:11:32.761 --> 03:11:33.891
"It'll make it easier."

03:11:33.891 --> 03:11:36.821
TALIESIN: Was one of them hurt by the displacer beast?

03:11:36.821 --> 03:11:37.981
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:11:37.981 --> 03:11:40.221
MATT: It seemed you guys holding their attention

03:11:40.221 --> 03:11:43.001
gave them the chance to actually sneak up upon one

03:11:43.001 --> 03:11:44.681
and take it out without an issue.

03:11:44.681 --> 03:11:48.101
TALIESIN: Yeah, where were from,
originally, out of curiosity?

03:11:48.101 --> 03:11:51.831
MATT: The guy, after taking this branch

03:11:51.831 --> 03:11:54.811
and tying the top half of the front legs

03:11:54.811 --> 03:11:58.231
around the pole begins to direct you to go ahead

03:11:58.231 --> 03:11:59.721
and take care of the other side,

03:11:59.721 --> 03:12:02.721
as the female begins to take and wipe off the axe.

03:12:02.721 --> 03:12:04.504
He goes, "Um,

TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, also.

03:12:17.593 --> 03:12:19.231
What are your names again?

I feel so bad.

"That I am.

TALIESIN: And, Jaina, do you remember where you're from,

out of curiosity?

03:12:39.391 --> 03:12:41.531
SAM: These are probing questions, Mr. Caduceus.

03:12:41.531 --> 03:12:42.511
MATT: "West?"

03:12:42.511 --> 03:12:43.494
SAM: Maybe we'll just--

03:12:43.494 --> 03:12:45.181
TALIESIN: I'm working a theory.

03:12:46.801 --> 03:12:47.721
MATT: "West, I think."

03:12:47.721 --> 03:12:49.231
TALIESIN: West?

West is nice.

"a lot of us here have a hard time remembering."

03:13:00.186 --> 03:13:01.718
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:13:01.718 --> 03:13:04.691
TALIESIN: Do you have any siblings?
LAURA: Do you eat the flowers?

ASHLEY: I feel fine.

03:13:17.054 --> 03:13:18.511
It was just a little bit,

03:13:18.511 --> 03:13:21.207
had, like, a little bit of a spice to it.

03:13:21.207 --> 03:13:23.957
MATT: "(laughs)" She punches you
in the shoulder and is like,

03:13:24.881 --> 03:13:26.491
"You'll be fine."

03:13:27.324 --> 03:13:28.291

MATT: "You're a bit skinny.

"Don't eat the flowers."

03:13:39.761 --> 03:13:41.861
She goes and grabs the part of the stick as well,

the center, where the displacer beast is picked up,

03:13:43.641 --> 03:13:46.521
and Pono is now pointing for you to grab the back half

03:13:46.521 --> 03:13:48.351

Oh god, are we going to have to fight a god

03:14:40.011 --> 03:14:41.141
to get to Traveler Con?
SAM: No, no, no,

03:14:41.141 --> 03:14:43.841
maybe they just call him a different name.

MATT: (as Pono) "Well, I've not seen them.

03:19:01.631 --> 03:19:03.191
"They live within the mountain itself.

03:19:03.191 --> 03:19:07.271
"But from what I hear, it's a great fiery beast,

03:19:07.271 --> 03:19:11.421
"an entity that resembles and encompasses the creation

03:19:11.421 --> 03:19:13.491
"of the world and its eventual destruction,

03:19:13.491 --> 03:19:17.474
"but here is its home, its nest,

03:19:17.474 --> 03:19:19.351
"and we care to it,

03:19:19.351 --> 03:19:21.861
"and as such, are given whatever we need."

03:19:21.861 --> 03:19:23.821
SAM: Do you guys, do any of you

03:19:23.821 --> 03:19:27.015
in the tribe do, like, (breathing like "Midsommar") hoh-hah, ever?

03:19:27.015 --> 03:19:28.551
Is that something any

03:19:28.551 --> 03:19:29.384
of you ever do?
MATT: "Breathing?"

03:19:29.384 --> 03:19:30.217
SAM: Hoh-hah!

03:19:30.217 --> 03:19:31.671
TRAVIS: I think it's the other way.

03:19:31.671 --> 03:19:32.971
Isn't it hah-hoh?
SAM: Hah-hoh!

03:19:32.971 --> 03:19:35.011
LAURA: No.
SAM: No, it's hoh-hah!

03:19:35.011 --> 03:19:37.081
Is that something that you guys do on the regular?

03:19:37.081 --> 03:19:37.914
MATT: They look at each other.

03:19:37.914 --> 03:19:39.131
LIAM: Do you group groan, do ya?

03:19:39.131 --> 03:19:40.391
MATT: "No."

03:19:40.391 --> 03:19:42.531
SAM: Okay, good, good to know, good to know.

03:19:42.531 --> 03:19:45.371
MATT: No, we have, as a hunting group, underneath Terra,

03:19:45.371 --> 03:19:47.861
we have certain calls, to make sure we know where we are.

03:19:47.861 --> 03:19:48.721
LAURA: Ah!

03:19:48.721 --> 03:19:49.727
MATT: "I can show you that."

03:19:49.727 --> 03:19:50.851
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:19:50.851 --> 03:19:53.551
MATT: And you watch as the elven woman, Jaina, goes

03:19:53.551 --> 03:19:56.071
and gives out this weird

03:19:56.071 --> 03:19:59.301
(sung tones) sound,

03:19:59.301 --> 03:20:01.021
this faint bird noise.

03:20:01.021 --> 03:20:02.161
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll learn how to do that.

03:20:02.161 --> 03:20:03.281
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: Can I try it?

03:20:03.281 --> 03:20:05.271
MATT: Wait, did you just do that to summon someone else,

03:20:05.271 --> 03:20:07.421
or that's just what you do?

03:20:07.421 --> 03:20:09.321
MATT: "I don't hear any returning hunting parties,

03:20:09.321 --> 03:20:12.361
"so we're not close to any of the others under Terra."

03:20:12.361 --> 03:20:13.612
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and do that.

03:20:13.612 --> 03:20:14.951
LAURA: (imitates Jaina)

03:20:14.951 --> 03:20:17.277
LIAM: Caduceus, play your flute.

03:20:17.277 --> 03:20:19.091
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't have my flute anymore.

03:20:19.091 --> 03:20:20.029
SAM: Hey, maybe when we get there.

03:20:20.029 --> 03:20:20.971
LIAM: What?!

03:20:20.971 --> 03:20:22.091
MATT: He gave the flute to his sister.

03:20:22.091 --> 03:20:23.757
TALIESIN: I gave my flute away.
LIAM: That's terrible.

03:20:23.757 --> 03:20:26.681
TRAVIS: I actually cannot wait to see your community.

03:20:26.681 --> 03:20:30.722
This great fiery beast, are the flames a certain color?

03:20:30.722 --> 03:20:33.411
LAURA: (imitates Jaina)

03:20:33.411 --> 03:20:34.991
MATT: "I have not seen.

03:20:34.991 --> 03:20:36.251
"There are some.

03:20:36.251 --> 03:20:40.291
"In fact, our spiritual leader has gone to visit this god.

03:20:40.291 --> 03:20:42.101
"Viridian, oh you should meet Viridian.

03:20:42.101 --> 03:20:43.151
"She could probably answer your questions."

03:20:43.151 --> 03:20:43.984
SAM and TRAVIS: Viridian?

03:20:43.984 --> 03:20:45.221
SAM: Is that one of the three leaders?

03:20:45.221 --> 03:20:47.421
MATT: "Yes, yes, there's Terra, who's the leader

03:20:47.421 --> 03:20:52.101
"of the hunting parties and our personal individual.

03:20:52.101 --> 03:20:56.431
"There's Lukash, who is in charge of construction

03:20:56.431 --> 03:20:59.281
"and organization of the actual community.

03:20:59.281 --> 03:21:00.761
"And then there is Viridian,

03:21:00.761 --> 03:21:03.331
"who is the spiritual leader,

03:21:03.331 --> 03:21:07.664
"and the one who

03:21:07.664 --> 03:21:09.639
"guides everyone

03:21:09.639 --> 03:21:12.571
"underneath the eye of Vokodo."

03:21:12.571 --> 03:21:14.911
TALIESIN: Oh.
SAM: This sounds amazing.

03:21:14.911 --> 03:21:18.121
We're so fortunate to have met you.

03:21:18.121 --> 03:21:21.751
Yes, we'd love to be introduced to the rest of your village

03:21:21.751 --> 03:21:24.961
and then maybe we could talk to your three leaders

03:21:24.961 --> 03:21:29.751
about our plans, while guests here.

03:21:29.751 --> 03:21:30.650
MATT: "Of course."
LAURA: Yeah, do you have any, like,

03:21:30.650 --> 03:21:32.842
big hotels or anything?

03:21:34.091 --> 03:21:36.131
MATT: "Don't have much in the way of, like, inns or hotels,

03:21:36.131 --> 03:21:37.831
"but we have places you could stay.

03:21:39.711 --> 03:21:40.544
"There's some room,

03:21:40.544 --> 03:21:43.421
"but we can start putting on something together, for you.

03:21:43.421 --> 03:21:44.331
"It's always expanding.

03:21:44.331 --> 03:21:47.731
"We're cutting down and making this place just grow

03:21:47.731 --> 03:21:49.001
"and swell with each new member."

03:21:49.001 --> 03:21:49.834
SAM: Amazing.

03:21:49.834 --> 03:21:53.191
LIAM: Have you any memories of the mainland,

03:21:53.191 --> 03:21:55.583
outside of this island?

03:21:57.691 --> 03:21:58.524
MATT: "I mean--"

03:22:00.871 --> 03:22:02.738
LIAM: Do you remember an inn?

03:22:04.091 --> 03:22:06.671
MATT: And she looks over to Pono, and Pono goes,

03:22:09.171 --> 03:22:10.954
"The thing is,

03:22:10.954 --> 03:22:13.437
"when you come to

03:22:13.437 --> 03:22:14.762
"the center of the world,

03:22:14.762 --> 03:22:17.571
"the rest of it doesn't matter that much."

03:22:23.131 --> 03:22:25.881
SAM: You know, sometimes, Cay-Cay,

03:22:25.881 --> 03:22:27.951
sometimes, people just don't want

03:22:27.951 --> 03:22:30.011
to remember some things, right, Caleb?

03:22:30.011 --> 03:22:30.961
I mean--
LIAM: Yeah, but the center

03:22:30.961 --> 03:22:32.994
of the world seems like such a--

03:22:35.320 --> 03:22:36.987
MARISHA: An opinion? Yeah.
LIAM: Subjective thing.

03:22:38.448 --> 03:22:40.221
SAM: I mean, we all think we're the center

03:22:40.221 --> 03:22:41.651
of our worlds, right?

03:22:41.651 --> 03:22:43.301
LIAM: We're all the center of our own world.

03:22:43.301 --> 03:22:48.011
MATT: "And yet, you found yourself here.

03:22:48.011 --> 03:22:51.731
"And that is a true sign

03:22:51.731 --> 03:22:54.101
"of a blessed guided journey, is it not?"

03:22:54.101 --> 03:22:55.572
SAM: It is not.

03:22:55.572 --> 03:22:57.560
(laughter)

03:22:57.560 --> 03:23:00.721
LIAM: That's some pretty culty talk.

03:23:00.721 --> 03:23:04.221
LAURA: I think the Traveler and Vokodo
should definitely meet.

03:23:05.261 --> 03:23:09.381
MATT: "I mean, this Traveler's your god, you say?"

03:23:09.381 --> 03:23:10.214
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

03:23:11.121 --> 03:23:12.161
MATT: "That would be interesting."

03:23:12.161 --> 03:23:13.461
SAM: Maybe they know each other, already.

03:23:13.461 --> 03:23:14.294
LAURA: Maybe they do. I mean,

03:23:14.294 --> 03:23:16.501
you know, the Traveler gets around,

03:23:16.501 --> 03:23:18.491
so he's been here already.

03:23:18.491 --> 03:23:20.063
SAM: If there's a--
LIAM: He's a pretty big deal.

03:23:20.063 --> 03:23:20.921
MATT: "Then Viridian, you should,

03:23:20.921 --> 03:23:22.671
"definitely, speak to."
SAM: I bet Traveler

03:23:22.671 --> 03:23:25.051
knows about him.

03:23:25.051 --> 03:23:29.141
TALIESIN: You mentioned an eye, the eye of--

03:23:29.141 --> 03:23:33.181
MATT: "Oh, just at night, the glowing sight,"

03:23:33.181 --> 03:23:35.881
and you see she points to the top of the mountain

03:23:35.881 --> 03:23:38.691
and Pono gives another backup point and goes,

03:23:38.691 --> 03:23:40.291
"Yeah, when it's real dark at night,

03:23:40.291 --> 03:23:43.421
"sometimes you can see the glowing top of the mountain,

03:23:43.421 --> 03:23:47.161
"and that, we know, is Vokodo looking down over us

03:23:47.161 --> 03:23:47.994
"and keeping us safe."

03:23:47.994 --> 03:23:49.651
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm really excited to see that.

03:23:49.651 --> 03:23:51.161
MARISHA: Or, you know, magma.

03:23:51.161 --> 03:23:54.761
LIAM: Right, it could just be
where the rock surface is thinned

03:23:54.761 --> 03:23:57.491
to the point of where the--
TALIESIN: Don't displace the magic

03:23:57.491 --> 03:23:59.431
of this moment.
SAM: This is their religion.

03:23:59.431 --> 03:24:00.481
TALIESIN: The natural world is wonderful.

03:24:00.481 --> 03:24:01.691
SAM: It's totally respectable.

03:24:01.691 --> 03:24:04.141
MARISHA: You just shat on their
religion, like, 30 second ago.

03:24:04.141 --> 03:24:05.934
SAM: Never did, not at all.

03:24:05.934 --> 03:24:07.221
TALIESIN: Ah--

03:24:07.221 --> 03:24:10.671
MATT: Beauregard, because you're all--

03:24:10.671 --> 03:24:12.931
TRAVIS: Level 12?
MATT: The same level, practically,

03:24:12.931 --> 03:24:16.341
of passive perception, you do notice that Pono,

03:24:16.341 --> 03:24:19.131
amongst the thick back hair, as he's walking,

03:24:19.131 --> 03:24:21.991
there's a very intricate tattoo that is hidden

03:24:21.991 --> 03:24:25.327
beneath that back hair.

03:24:26.801 --> 03:24:28.848
It's a unique symbol.

03:24:28.848 --> 03:24:32.531
It's like a little curved C with a line through it

03:24:32.531 --> 03:24:34.521
and another one behind it.

03:24:34.521 --> 03:24:36.201
You can make a history check, if you'd like.

03:24:36.201 --> 03:24:38.471
SAM: Chaos Crew?

03:24:38.471 --> 03:24:39.441
LAURA: The Clasp.

03:24:39.441 --> 03:24:41.112
LIAM: Natural 20!

03:24:41.112 --> 03:24:42.551
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: This is indeed a symbol

03:24:42.551 --> 03:24:46.111
of the Clasp, which is a prominent thieves' guild,

03:24:46.111 --> 03:24:47.801
largely based out of Tal'Dorei

03:24:47.801 --> 03:24:49.631
to the far west of Wildemount.

03:24:49.631 --> 03:24:51.591
SAM: Does Caleb know about them?

03:24:51.591 --> 03:24:53.031
MATT: Caleb would know about it from the history,

03:24:53.031 --> 03:24:53.864
with a history check.

03:24:53.864 --> 03:24:55.530
SAM: Oh, that was your history check.

03:24:55.530 --> 03:24:57.101
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
SAM: Oh.

03:24:57.101 --> 03:24:57.934
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

03:24:57.934 --> 03:24:59.642
TRAVIS: Are we being poisoned by this mist?

03:24:59.642 --> 03:25:00.961
LIAM: Did you say where--
LAURA: That's what I think.

03:25:00.961 --> 03:25:03.049
LIAM: Or just from the mainland?
LAURA: I think it's the mist.

03:25:03.049 --> 03:25:04.545
SAM: You said Tal'Dorei.

03:25:04.545 --> 03:25:06.391
MATT: Tal'Dorei is where the Clasp is based.

03:25:06.391 --> 03:25:07.771
LIAM: Okay.

03:25:07.771 --> 03:25:09.461
A far-off land that we're not from.

03:25:09.461 --> 03:25:10.701
MATT: To the west of Wildemount.

03:25:10.701 --> 03:25:12.673
LIAM: Yes, never been there.

03:25:12.673 --> 03:25:13.831
MATT: But nevertheless, you guys continue

03:25:13.831 --> 03:25:16.271
to journey along with them.

03:25:16.271 --> 03:25:18.071
They're happy to answer any questions you guys have

03:25:18.071 --> 03:25:19.911
on the way, if you have any more.

03:25:19.911 --> 03:25:21.181
TALIESIN: I'm pretty--

03:25:21.181 --> 03:25:23.921
TRAVIS: Well, you mentioned Lukash, Viridian.

03:25:23.921 --> 03:25:26.001
You said there was a third leader.

03:25:26.001 --> 03:25:30.101
MATT: "Ah, Terra. Terra is our hunting master,

03:25:30.101 --> 03:25:33.991
"the one that helps guide and organize us

03:25:34.901 --> 03:25:38.842
"to procure the meats and the

03:25:40.567 --> 03:25:42.525
"destruction of the dangerous creatures

03:25:42.525 --> 03:25:44.111
"and denizens of the land,

03:25:44.111 --> 03:25:46.571
"to give thanks for their bountiful gifts

03:25:46.571 --> 03:25:50.001
"of their own bodies, of which
we use to feed our community."

03:25:50.001 --> 03:25:52.231
TRAVIS: Because you seem to be a part of the hunting party,

03:25:52.231 --> 03:25:56.191
is Terra also a bear person?

03:25:56.191 --> 03:25:58.571
MATT: "Oh no, that's primarily just us.

03:25:58.571 --> 03:26:00.311
"There's one other lycanthrope on the island,

03:26:00.311 --> 03:26:02.241
"but they're more of the tiger variety."

03:26:02.241 --> 03:26:03.161
LAURA: Ooh!

03:26:03.161 --> 03:26:03.994
MATT: "We're an eclectic bunch.

03:26:03.994 --> 03:26:04.861
"We're from all over.

03:26:04.861 --> 03:26:05.911
"It's kind of fun.

03:26:05.911 --> 03:26:10.891
"We all get to mingle and see
"who's going to show up next."

03:26:10.891 --> 03:26:12.661
LIAM: How many of you are there,

03:26:12.661 --> 03:26:15.321
here, approximately?
MATT: "I'd say we're close

03:26:15.321 --> 03:26:17.351
"to maybe, like-- where we at?"

03:26:17.351 --> 03:26:19.261
Pono's like, "Last count,

03:26:19.261 --> 03:26:21.131
"I think we were close to 70."

03:26:21.131 --> 03:26:22.671
LAURA: Wah!

03:26:22.671 --> 03:26:23.504
That's a lot.

03:26:23.504 --> 03:26:26.911
SAM: Do the three make decisions
as a group, as a triumvirate,

03:26:26.911 --> 03:26:30.663
or is there one who's a prime of the three?

03:26:32.221 --> 03:26:35.911
MATT: Jaina goes, "I mean, they all commune

03:26:35.911 --> 03:26:39.011
"over serious issues that require all their attention,

03:26:39.011 --> 03:26:41.291
"but they each have their own domains.

03:26:41.291 --> 03:26:45.051
"I guess Viridian's the spiritual head of that."

03:26:45.051 --> 03:26:47.531
SAM: And so if we were going to request a favor

03:26:47.531 --> 03:26:52.021
of your group, is there any advice you can give us,

03:26:52.021 --> 03:26:53.881
some gift that we could offer

03:26:53.881 --> 03:26:57.231
to sort of make ourselves in good favor?

03:26:57.231 --> 03:27:00.231
MATT: "Be nice, be helpful, show that you're useful

03:27:00.231 --> 03:27:01.441
"and part of the community."

03:27:01.441 --> 03:27:04.765
SAM: And never leave, right? Haha, right?

03:27:04.765 --> 03:27:08.101
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:27:08.101 --> 03:27:09.611
MATT: "We're not keeping you here."

03:27:09.611 --> 03:27:10.671
SAM: Of course not, why would you?

03:27:10.671 --> 03:27:11.504
That would be weird.

03:27:11.504 --> 03:27:13.541
LIAM: But is your god, like, a vengeful god

03:27:13.541 --> 03:27:17.011
or a benevolent god, a relaxed and groovy?

03:27:17.011 --> 03:27:18.314
MATT: They both look at each other.

03:27:18.314 --> 03:27:22.311
"I don't know, we keep him happy, and he keeps us happy.

03:27:22.311 --> 03:27:23.711
"There hasn't really been a problem.

03:27:23.711 --> 03:27:25.821
"So I don't think it's a vengeful thing.

03:27:25.821 --> 03:27:27.421
"There's nothing to avenge." (laughs)

03:27:28.324 --> 03:27:32.111
MARISHA: When you talk about making these sacrifices,

03:27:32.111 --> 03:27:35.686
giving these gifts to Vokodo,

03:27:36.669 --> 03:27:38.771
how do you do that?

03:27:38.771 --> 03:27:41.681
How do you give back the gems?

03:27:41.681 --> 03:27:46.231
MATT: "Well, I'm not privy to that, neither is Pono,

03:27:46.231 --> 03:27:49.481
"but organizing, Viridian and other individuals,

03:27:49.481 --> 03:27:52.871
"when some of these treasures, these riches are gathered,

03:27:52.871 --> 03:27:54.451
"whether they be pulled from the earth,

03:27:54.451 --> 03:27:57.081
"whether they be scavenged from beneath the waves,

03:27:57.081 --> 03:27:59.151
"whether they be brought here

03:27:59.151 --> 03:28:02.401
"by those who washed up on shore,

03:28:02.401 --> 03:28:07.401
"these are gathered and brought to, apparently,

03:28:07.931 --> 03:28:11.021
"doors into the mountain itself.

03:28:11.021 --> 03:28:14.691
"And these are gifted to the god, and as such,

03:28:14.691 --> 03:28:18.711
"Vokodo thus brings the blessing down upon us."

03:28:18.711 --> 03:28:21.241
LAURA: You don't know where the doors are, though?

03:28:21.241 --> 03:28:22.561
MATT: "We're not privy to that, right?"

03:28:22.561 --> 03:28:24.831
And Pono's like, "We're not.

03:28:24.831 --> 03:28:26.251
"We're the hunters.

03:28:26.251 --> 03:28:28.201
"I wouldn't even know what to do if I went there, honestly.

03:28:28.201 --> 03:28:29.791
"I'd be too nervous." (laughs)

03:28:29.791 --> 03:28:32.051
ASHLEY: Wait, you might have already answered this,

03:28:32.051 --> 03:28:36.721
but who decides what the offerings are?

03:28:36.721 --> 03:28:39.461
MATT: "Well, Viridian speaks to Vokodo--"

03:28:39.461 --> 03:28:42.241
LAURA: Oh great!
MATT: "And then through Viridian,

03:28:42.241 --> 03:28:44.531
"the offers are brought, but as far as I know,

03:28:44.531 --> 03:28:47.411
"it's mostly just whatever we can find."

03:28:47.411 --> 03:28:48.244
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:28:48.244 --> 03:28:50.631
TRAVIS: You said there are some mines on the island, yes?

03:28:50.631 --> 03:28:52.151
MATT: "Right."
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:28:52.151 --> 03:28:57.151
MARISHA: And Vokodo primarily likes gems and metals,

03:28:57.241 --> 03:28:59.831
precious metals and treasures?
MATT: "Things shiny."

03:28:59.831 --> 03:29:02.501
MARISHA: Things that are shiny.
MATT: "Beautiful from the earth,

03:29:02.501 --> 03:29:05.341
"things that are brought in, well-crafted."

03:29:05.341 --> 03:29:08.391
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I bet Vokodo
would like one of these!

03:29:09.361 --> 03:29:12.131
And I pull out a little Traveler dick statue.

03:29:12.131 --> 03:29:15.281
MATT: They both go, "Oh, I bet they would!"

03:29:15.281 --> 03:29:16.696
LAURA: Yep, yep, yep.

03:29:16.696 --> 03:29:18.171
MATT: "Oh, bring that to Viridian.

03:29:18.171 --> 03:29:19.181
"We'll add it to the pile."

03:29:19.181 --> 03:29:20.151
LAURA: I will.

03:29:20.151 --> 03:29:22.281
MATT: "All right."

03:29:22.281 --> 03:29:24.181
Oh, and I'd say, at this point, you're getting--

03:29:24.181 --> 03:29:25.341
we'll say you've traveled for a while,

03:29:25.341 --> 03:29:26.921
and you've bantered back and forth a bit.

03:29:26.921 --> 03:29:29.401
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ.
MATT: "We're coming up!"

03:29:29.401 --> 03:29:30.941
And as you guys begin to approach,

03:29:30.941 --> 03:29:32.201
you see the treeline begin to thin,

03:29:32.201 --> 03:29:35.171
and you can see there are a few stumps

03:29:35.171 --> 03:29:37.321
where some trees have been felled in the past.

03:29:37.321 --> 03:29:41.581
You can see, as the mist itself clears a bit

03:29:41.581 --> 03:29:45.046
from your vision, into the opening of this village.

03:29:46.551 --> 03:29:51.551
You are caught off guard by all the heavy ropes

03:29:51.741 --> 03:29:53.381
that are tied to these higher trunks and branches.

03:29:53.381 --> 03:29:54.401
You've heard Caleb describe them,

03:29:54.401 --> 03:29:58.491
but now you can see this massive tangle

03:29:58.491 --> 03:30:01.861
of the wildest Swiss Family Robinson series

03:30:01.861 --> 03:30:04.591
of tree houses that all create this community

03:30:04.591 --> 03:30:08.121
of makeshift, scavenged materials.

03:30:09.361 --> 03:30:11.831
You can see the scavenged ship parts.

03:30:11.831 --> 03:30:15.231
You can see local lumber, intricately woven

03:30:15.231 --> 03:30:19.581
in grown vines and dried vegetation.

03:30:19.581 --> 03:30:21.611
You see a third of the buildings that are built up above,

03:30:21.611 --> 03:30:23.251
in different levels, that are all connected

03:30:23.251 --> 03:30:26.411
by these same bridges that Caleb had mentioned earlier.

03:30:26.411 --> 03:30:29.201
The supports and frames to a lot of it, it shouldn't stand.

03:30:29.201 --> 03:30:30.531
A lot of this looks rickety,

03:30:30.531 --> 03:30:32.651
but you can see most of these structures are supported

03:30:32.651 --> 03:30:37.531
by thick, healthy vines, green vines

03:30:37.531 --> 03:30:40.591
that are braided and entwined and tend to hold

03:30:40.591 --> 03:30:42.891
and wrap around them, in a very unnatural way.

03:30:44.431 --> 03:30:48.612
The jungle itself seems to have risen to support

03:30:48.612 --> 03:30:53.531
and help hold this village together, structure to structure.

03:30:53.531 --> 03:30:55.781
So you have this patchwork, ramshackle look

03:30:55.781 --> 03:31:00.248
and this beautiful, natural growth aspect to it.

03:31:02.311 --> 03:31:04.641
You also can see the buildings are diverse

03:31:04.641 --> 03:31:07.041
in styles, materials, apparent age.

03:31:07.041 --> 03:31:07.874
Some look newer.

03:31:07.874 --> 03:31:08.707
Some look older.

03:31:09.841 --> 03:31:12.271
It's a very charming feel to it,

03:31:12.271 --> 03:31:14.581
and you can see figures that live here,

03:31:14.581 --> 03:31:18.511
beginning to come into view, look over at the arrival

03:31:18.511 --> 03:31:23.371
of both Jaina and Pono and their successful hunt,

03:31:23.371 --> 03:31:26.111
but this batch of newcomers, and with each face,

03:31:26.111 --> 03:31:29.309
smiles light up, and individuals wave.

03:31:30.791 --> 03:31:33.341
Dozens of these various denizens begin

03:31:33.341 --> 03:31:36.591
to stop their work and turn to look to your direction

03:31:36.591 --> 03:31:40.601
and, excitedly, though not too intensely,

03:31:40.601 --> 03:31:43.568
just look and take each of you in.

03:31:44.811 --> 03:31:48.211
Some folks rush off to tell others, "New arrivals!"

03:31:49.151 --> 03:31:52.871
Some are saying, "We grow under his joy,"

03:31:52.871 --> 03:31:56.748
and give a blessing symbol with their hands.

03:31:56.748 --> 03:31:58.561
LAURA: Oh.

03:31:58.561 --> 03:32:00.241
MATT: Eventually, you have a crowd gather,

03:32:00.241 --> 03:32:04.901
of about 30 to 35 of the local villagers here,

03:32:04.901 --> 03:32:07.291
that begin to encircle around the base

03:32:07.291 --> 03:32:09.201
of the central massive tree

03:32:09.201 --> 03:32:12.071
that marks the middle point of this village.

03:32:12.071 --> 03:32:14.791
Here, the tree itself is lush and tall,

03:32:14.791 --> 03:32:17.191
maybe 200 or more feet up,

03:32:17.191 --> 03:32:18.581
with numerous levels of branches,

03:32:18.581 --> 03:32:20.431
and each of these branches is like a hand

03:32:20.431 --> 03:32:22.241
where the vines have grown out

03:32:22.241 --> 03:32:25.161
to clutch another small homestead,

03:32:25.161 --> 03:32:27.663
and all of these themselves have connected vine bridges.

03:32:27.663 --> 03:32:29.451
LAURA: (whispering) Wow.

03:32:29.451 --> 03:32:34.281
MATT: These vines are unnaturally directed and beautiful.

03:32:34.281 --> 03:32:38.281
It resembles a lot of the-- from what you guys have noticed

03:32:38.281 --> 03:32:40.731
in your travels, most of you would not have been

03:32:40.731 --> 03:32:45.731
to a high-elven establishment,

03:32:45.731 --> 03:32:48.191
but a lot of the architecture there resembles

03:32:48.191 --> 03:32:51.753
what naturally occurs here in the middle of the village,

03:32:52.921 --> 03:32:57.109
deliberate and balanced with the natural world around it.

03:32:58.291 --> 03:32:59.721
As you approach the people who have gathered,

03:32:59.721 --> 03:33:01.871
you see stepping out of the crowd

03:33:01.871 --> 03:33:06.091
that orcish figure that you noticed earlier.

03:33:06.091 --> 03:33:10.051
The tall orc figure steps, in his rusted ring mail,

03:33:10.051 --> 03:33:13.191
with a smile on his face.

03:33:13.191 --> 03:33:16.781
You can see the gray skin and bright smile,

03:33:16.781 --> 03:33:21.231
long hair that hangs to his belt, in multiple thick braids,

03:33:21.231 --> 03:33:24.221
and he wears a belt around the center of the ring mail,

03:33:24.221 --> 03:33:26.081
where you can see maybe a half dozen tools,

03:33:26.081 --> 03:33:28.581
jingle at the side.

03:33:28.581 --> 03:33:29.631
And as he approaches,

03:33:30.621 --> 03:33:35.621
"Ah, it has been some time since we've had new blood

03:33:35.751 --> 03:33:39.511
"in the village. Welcome.

03:33:39.511 --> 03:33:41.727
"I am Lukash. Oh--"

03:33:41.727 --> 03:33:43.671
He turns, and you can see one

03:33:43.671 --> 03:33:46.741
of the vines lowering and unfurls,

03:33:46.741 --> 03:33:48.101
and standing on the vine

03:33:48.101 --> 03:33:49.879
as it descends--
LAURA: What?

03:33:49.879 --> 03:33:53.411
MATT: Like Poison Ivy, as it unfurls,

03:33:53.411 --> 03:33:58.221
you see a half-elven woman, standing there,

03:33:58.221 --> 03:34:01.718
with dark, sunburned skin.

03:34:02.661 --> 03:34:05.791
You see dark-brown hair that is wild

03:34:05.791 --> 03:34:08.251
but sun-bleached at the tips.

03:34:09.281 --> 03:34:12.241
She stands with a presence that is formidable

03:34:12.241 --> 03:34:15.091
but a gentle smile and demeanor.

03:34:15.091 --> 03:34:17.321
She steps off from this vine,

03:34:17.321 --> 03:34:19.351
and you can see she's covered in leathers

03:34:19.351 --> 03:34:22.011
with elements of dried leaves and scales

03:34:22.011 --> 03:34:24.611
that blend together.

03:34:24.611 --> 03:34:27.061
The left leg is a vibrant green,

03:34:27.061 --> 03:34:30.181
made of tightly knotted vines, almost,

03:34:30.181 --> 03:34:34.111
and a staff descends into one hand,

03:34:34.111 --> 03:34:36.821
as she steps off of the vine and approaches.

03:34:36.821 --> 03:34:39.441
"And I am Viridian.

03:34:39.441 --> 03:34:41.831
"It is a pleasure to have you.

03:34:41.831 --> 03:34:43.511
"I'm curious,

03:34:43.511 --> 03:34:45.151
"what is your tale?

03:34:45.151 --> 03:34:47.644
"Please, tell us."

03:34:49.211 --> 03:34:50.141
And that's where we'll end tonight.

03:34:50.141 --> 03:34:51.430
ALL: Oh!

03:34:51.430 --> 03:34:53.421
No!

03:34:53.421 --> 03:34:55.071
TALIESIN: Oh boy.
SAM: What is our tale?

03:34:55.071 --> 03:34:57.331
LIAM: Oh shit, we did it! We played the game,

03:34:57.331 --> 03:34:59.251
with a beginning, a middle, and an end!

03:34:59.251 --> 03:35:00.640
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:35:00.640 --> 03:35:02.211
SAM: I like how

03:35:02.211 --> 03:35:03.621
during that whole description,

03:35:03.621 --> 03:35:05.321
Laura was like, "Ooh, this is creepy."

03:35:05.321 --> 03:35:10.187
You're organizing a cult!
MARISHA: A cult, yeah, cult v. cult.

03:35:10.187 --> 03:35:12.814
SAM: In, like, seven days!
LIAM: So much less established than these people.

03:35:12.814 --> 03:35:14.271
TALIESIN: This is somewhere I've been looking forward to.

03:35:14.271 --> 03:35:15.659
LAURA: Oh, maybe I should be taking notes.

03:35:15.659 --> 03:35:17.241
SAM: Yes!

03:35:17.241 --> 03:35:18.151
They've got their shit down.

03:35:18.151 --> 03:35:21.321
LAURA: "We grow under his blessing," or some shit like that.

03:35:21.321 --> 03:35:23.024
SAM: They have phrases. Come on, work on this stuff.

03:35:23.024 --> 03:35:24.471
LAURA: Wait, I need phrases.

03:35:24.471 --> 03:35:25.985
SAM: Yeah!

03:35:25.985 --> 03:35:29.458
LAURA: Oh, I need to work on some phrases.
MARISHA: I don't want to say it.

03:35:29.458 --> 03:35:31.591
He's-- dragon?

03:35:31.591 --> 03:35:32.941
He's a dragon. Right?

03:35:32.941 --> 03:35:35.551
TRAVIS: I was thinking a dragon or maybe that purple phoenix

03:35:35.551 --> 03:35:37.521
that was at the beginning of the campaign,

03:35:37.521 --> 03:35:39.446
one of those three deities that's like--

03:35:39.446 --> 03:35:40.537
ALL: Oh!

03:35:40.537 --> 03:35:43.370
TRAVIS: Or not the deities, like the other--
MARISHA: Oh, with the Uk'otoa shit.

03:35:43.370 --> 03:35:45.454
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was thinking that route.

03:35:45.454 --> 03:35:46.591
MARISHA: Worm and the phoenix.

03:35:46.591 --> 03:35:48.221
TALIESIN: But it's a purple fire or something like,

03:35:48.221 --> 03:35:49.054
blackish-purple.

03:35:49.054 --> 03:35:51.171
LAURA: Is she controlling the vines?

03:35:51.171 --> 03:35:52.921
Is that thing controlling the vines?

03:35:52.921 --> 03:35:54.191
Is the god controlling the vines?

03:35:54.191 --> 03:35:57.229
TRAVIS: Do you think if they're inhaling this mist--

03:35:57.229 --> 03:35:59.911
we have, like, Lay on Hands, I could cure a disease

03:35:59.911 --> 03:36:02.601
or a poison and see if one of them snaps out of it?

03:36:02.601 --> 03:36:03.434
MARISHA: Maybe.

03:36:03.434 --> 03:36:04.361
SAM: What if we spend the night here,

03:36:04.361 --> 03:36:06.331
and we wake up with--
TRAVIS: That's what I mean!

03:36:06.331 --> 03:36:07.321
ASHLEY: No.
MARISHA: What if we're all rolling

03:36:07.321 --> 03:36:09.431
saving throw, in the next morning.

03:36:09.431 --> 03:36:12.931
ASHLEY: The mist is--
TRAVIS: Fuck.

03:36:12.931 --> 03:36:13.764
LAURA: I think it's the mist.

03:36:13.764 --> 03:36:14.941
MARISHA: It's like the plane of Abyss,

03:36:14.941 --> 03:36:16.051
and the longer you're there,

03:36:16.051 --> 03:36:17.771
the more crazy you get.
TRAVIS: It's got to be.

03:36:17.771 --> 03:36:19.201
LAURA: They said something about time, too,

03:36:19.201 --> 03:36:21.081
like, time stands still here.

03:36:21.081 --> 03:36:23.064
How long have these people been here?

03:36:23.064 --> 03:36:27.361
MATT: As a note, too, since you've entered this jungle,

03:36:27.361 --> 03:36:30.181
that feeling, that feeling of being watched,

03:36:30.181 --> 03:36:33.822
of looking over your shoulder, has never stopped.

03:36:35.241 --> 03:36:37.258
The displacer beast encounter,

03:36:38.311 --> 03:36:41.291
that seems to have had nothing to do with that sense,

03:36:41.291 --> 03:36:44.461
that creeping sense that has just always been there.

03:36:44.461 --> 03:36:46.774
LAURA: Avocado <i>is</i> the mist.

03:36:46.774 --> 03:36:47.607
LIAM: Yes.

03:36:47.607 --> 03:36:50.780
SAM and MATT: Avocado.

03:36:50.780 --> 03:36:53.221
SAM: Ah yes, The Mighty Nein:

03:36:53.221 --> 03:36:56.661
Insulting people's gods since 2020.

03:36:56.661 --> 03:36:57.494
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:36:57.494 --> 03:37:00.001
MATT: Hey, it's a brand.

03:37:00.001 --> 03:37:03.071
Anyway, we'll pick up on there next week.

03:37:03.071 --> 03:37:04.021
TRAVIS: Guys, we did it.
MATT: We did it!

03:37:04.021 --> 03:37:05.687
We played an episode! Oh my god!

03:37:05.687 --> 03:37:06.901
MARISHA: Oh, we did it!

03:37:06.901 --> 03:37:09.448
LIAM: Ponzi scheme meet Ponzi scheme.

03:37:09.448 --> 03:37:11.876
(laughter)

03:37:11.876 --> 03:37:14.121
ASHLEY: Oh, this was so needed.
TRAVIS: So good to be back.

03:37:14.121 --> 03:37:15.561
MATT: Oh, I missed you guys so much.

03:37:15.561 --> 03:37:16.601
TALIESIN: Oh man.

03:37:16.601 --> 03:37:17.511
MATT: Missed you guys so much.

03:37:17.511 --> 03:37:19.001
MARISHA: Hey, we did it.

03:37:19.001 --> 03:37:21.101
MATT: I've been fighting getting emotional, all night.

03:37:21.101 --> 03:37:21.934
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

03:37:21.934 --> 03:37:23.321
MARISHA: I'm going to sleep so hard after this.

03:37:23.321 --> 03:37:25.725
TALIESIN: Oh man.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:37:25.725 --> 03:37:28.041
MATT: Well, thank you guys for joining us.

03:37:28.041 --> 03:37:29.111
We're so happy to be back.

03:37:29.111 --> 03:37:30.581
We're so happy to see you.

03:37:30.581 --> 03:37:31.501
LAURA: We love you.

03:37:31.501 --> 03:37:32.851
MATT: We love you guys so much.

03:37:34.254 --> 03:37:35.191
The world is dark.

03:37:35.191 --> 03:37:36.071
Find your light.

03:37:36.071 --> 03:37:37.201
We're happy to be that for each other.

03:37:37.201 --> 03:37:39.981
We hope we can be that for you, in some way.

03:37:39.981 --> 03:37:41.241
We love you very much.

03:37:41.241 --> 03:37:44.216
And is it Thursday yet?

03:37:44.216 --> 03:37:45.282
Good night.

03:37:45.282 --> 03:37:47.532
(cheering)

03:37:48.695 --> 03:37:49.995
ASHLEY: Yay!

01:53:53.055 --> 01:53:54.050
Hey, Critters!

01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:55.300
Laura Bailey here.

01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:58.040
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.390
(upbeat music)

01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:03.063
Ooh, check out the details on this thing!

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.152
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

01:54:08.152 --> 01:54:09.601
(meows)

01:54:09.601 --> 01:54:10.970
(water pouring)

01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:13.190
Darling, I recommend buying two.

01:54:13.190 --> 01:54:16.640
One for you, and another...for you.

01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:17.613
Let's be honest.

01:54:18.810 --> 01:54:20.760
This is a lot of stuff, you guys,

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:23.373
we have like so many cool things right now.

01:54:25.203 --> 01:54:27.500
You're only like five clicks
 away from owning this.

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:30.030
Maybe more, if you have a lot of windows open

01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:32.800
on your browser, I don't know your life.

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:33.920
All of this and more,

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.023
now available in the Critical Role shop.

01:54:42.127 --> 01:54:44.877
(cheerful music)

01:54:46.026 --> 01:54:48.609
(bell ringing)

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.120
So here at Critter Hug,

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:55.800
we have a serious and solemn belief

01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:57.790
that anything can and will be made better

01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:59.240
by adding drag queens to it.

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.210
That's why this hug is for the Queens of Adventure,

01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:05.420
a D&amp;D podcast where drag queens play D&amp;D!

01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.440
Now, the creator Matt Baume is a drag photographer

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.770
and an RPG enthusiast and he's theorized that

01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:12.320
drag fans and D&amp;D fans have way more in common

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:13.270
than one might think.

01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:15.874
In terms of, if I do it right, fucking--

01:55:15.874 --> 01:55:16.707
Oh no!

01:55:16.707 --> 01:55:17.540
There we go.

01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:18.410
And it turns out,

01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:19.938
Fucking, fucking...

01:55:19.938 --> 01:55:20.771
(laughing)

01:55:20.771 --> 01:55:22.750
I've presented the internet as a pasty-ass nerd boy

01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:24.588
enough as it is, let me have at least one moment of--

01:55:24.588 --> 01:55:25.421
(laughing)

01:55:25.421 --> 01:55:27.610
- Of enjoying a subculture that I do.

01:55:27.610 --> 01:55:29.030
And it turns out,

01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:30.730
he was correct.

01:55:30.730 --> 01:55:32.290
After a very successful Kickstarter,

01:55:32.290 --> 01:55:34.090
Queens of Adventure was born.

01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:35.870
Their first show sold out immediately

01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:37.410
and I mean, why wouldn't it?

01:55:37.410 --> 01:55:40.090
Matt acted as the DM alongside a group of fabulous queens

01:55:40.090 --> 01:55:43.135
including Arson Nicki, Butylene O'Kipple,

01:55:43.135 --> 01:55:45.310
Fraya Love, Harlotte O'Scara,

01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:47.010
Londyn Bradshaw, and Irene Dubois!

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:49.800
Ah, that's a lot of names.

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:52.180
This fan actually comes in quite handy.

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.930
After their first show, Matt and the queens started

01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:56.180
their first campaign which is still going on now

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:57.920
two years later.

01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.900
I'm gonna walk right up to the salamander--

01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:00.733
Oh no.

01:56:00.733 --> 01:56:04.140
And just extend my neck frills

01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:07.210
and hiss as loud as I possibly can.

01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:09.780
Okay, roll intimidation.

01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:10.613
Oh my god.

01:56:10.613 --> 01:56:11.750
You're like charging towards it?

01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:12.583
Mm-hmm.

01:56:12.583 --> 01:56:16.260
I'm like (silly lizard noises)

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:19.700
That was a natural one, my intimidation is minus one

01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:21.324
so that was fully a zero.

01:56:21.324 --> 01:56:22.852
Oh!
(laughing)

01:56:22.852 --> 01:56:25.604
Wow.
Sounds awesome.

01:56:25.604 --> 01:56:26.530
Wooh!

01:56:26.530 --> 01:56:28.113
Scary in a sick way.

01:56:29.474 --> 01:56:30.743
Get outta here!

01:56:30.743 --> 01:56:32.993
(laughing)

01:56:34.190 --> 01:56:35.410
I've heard about it for a long time

01:56:35.410 --> 01:56:36.920
and I actually had a chance to listen to it recently

01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:38.150
and they do an incredible job

01:56:38.150 --> 01:56:39.412
and have been doing this for quite some time.

01:56:39.412 --> 01:56:40.245
Yeah!

01:56:40.245 --> 01:56:41.078
If you haven't had a chance, check it out,

01:56:41.078 --> 01:56:42.020
I highly recommend it.

01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:42.970
I don't know, I just feel like both are

01:56:42.970 --> 01:56:44.070
such great self-expressions

01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:45.799
that queens doing D&amp;D is just like,

01:56:45.799 --> 01:56:48.090
the self-expression Venn diagram--

01:56:48.090 --> 01:56:48.923
Yeah.

01:56:48.923 --> 01:56:49.756
--Is just a circle?

01:56:49.756 --> 01:56:50.589
Yeah.

01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:51.422
Discovering your better self,

01:56:51.422 --> 01:56:52.560
through the creation of a different persona.

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:53.413
I have a question for you.

01:56:53.413 --> 01:56:54.246
Yeah?

01:56:54.246 --> 01:56:55.110
Do you have a drag name?

01:56:55.110 --> 01:56:55.943
I do not.
(gasps)

01:56:55.943 --> 01:56:57.070
One of these days I'll figure it out.

01:56:57.070 --> 01:56:58.160
Matt!

01:56:58.160 --> 01:56:59.900
I have a deep-seated dream, one of these days,

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:01.360
to find the right person to get me in full drag

01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:02.670
and figure out my drag name then.

01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:03.630
What about you, what's your drag name?

01:57:03.630 --> 01:57:06.330
My drag name is Misstress Bambi D'Biatch.

01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:07.780
It was given to me in college.

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:08.613
That's amazing!

01:57:08.613 --> 01:57:09.446
Thank you!

01:57:09.446 --> 01:57:11.240
And it's been my drag name ever since,

01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:12.820
Misstress Bambi D'Biatch.

01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:15.410
I myself am super excited to try and check out a live show

01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:17.650
when it comes through LA at some point in the near future.

01:57:17.650 --> 01:57:18.483
I feel like that would be

01:57:18.483 --> 01:57:20.200
a really good challenge on Drag Race,

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:21.940
like you have to take a D&amp;D class

01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:22.980
and make, like, a look out of it!

01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:24.277
Matt!

01:57:24.277 --> 01:57:27.250
If Ru needs a judge, or two, for the episode,

01:57:27.250 --> 01:57:28.083
I'm just saying.

01:57:28.083 --> 01:57:29.920 line:20%
RuPaul! Call us!

01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:31.780
But you can support the Queens of Adventure

01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:33.310
through their Patreon where you get access to

01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:35.230
bonus episodes, digital goodies,

01:57:35.230 --> 01:57:37.240
and even shape the game's story.

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:38.970
They actually just launched their second podcast,

01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:40.399
Queens of Adventure: Legends,

01:57:40.399 --> 01:57:42.400
which'll be oneshots only.

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:44.370
And they just finished a run of live shows,

01:57:44.370 --> 01:57:45.850
up and down the West Coast, actually,

01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:46.960
and are planning on doing many more

01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:49.030
across the entirety of this country,

01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:52.220
so maybe even your home town, if you ask.

01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:54.670
Never underestimate the power of writing letters.

01:57:55.890 --> 01:57:58.920
Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas is for

01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.570
the Queens of Adventure to come to my home town,

01:58:01.570 --> 01:58:03.880
play D&amp;D, and spit shade

01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:06.410
like the Dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park.

01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:11.010
(cheerful music)

01:58:21.391 --> 01:58:23.891
(jazzy music)

01:58:25.630 --> 01:58:27.030
Hello, everyone.

01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:29.440 line:20%
It's me, Marisha Ray.

01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:32.200 line:20%
Creative director for Critical Role content.

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.310 line:20%
And I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:37.380 line:20%
about how much we appreciate your support.

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:41.800
No frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:42.940
Over the past five years,

01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:46.520
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos in an attempt to

01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:49.080
earn your subscription here on Twitch.

01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:52.690
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor, cheap costumes,

01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:55.110
and putting our loyal employees

01:58:55.110 --> 01:58:56.960
in slightly embarrassing situations,

01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:00.110
eagerly hoping that we've captured your attention.

01:59:00.110 --> 01:59:03.610
Today, I am not resorting to edgelord jokes

01:59:03.610 --> 01:59:08.230
written by Brian W. Foster, or dressing Sam as a celebrity

01:59:08.230 --> 01:59:12.100
to recreate an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:15.060
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account

01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:17.890
requires you to resubscribe each month.

01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:21.260
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:24.010
or have to put Matt in cosplay to tell you that

01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:26.810
you can easily give subscriptions to fellow Critters

01:59:26.810 --> 01:59:28.530
if you're feeling generous.

01:59:28.530 --> 01:59:32.400
I mean hell, I've consumed entire production days

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:34.440
shooting complicated parody promos

01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:37.430
featuring Taliesin Jaffe as a vintage spooky boy

01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:39.760
in full monochromatic glory,

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.663
all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub.

01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:45.883
But not today.

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.890 line:20%
No weird graphics.

01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:50.193 line:20%
No puppet murder.

01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:53.117
No Sam Riegel.

01:59:56.749 --> 01:59:57.583
It's just me.

01:59:58.710 --> 02:00:01.273
Here to say, thank you.

02:00:02.770 --> 02:00:03.603
Love you all.

02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:06.340
Good night.

02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:08.423
(kisses)

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:15.591
Three, two, one.

02:00:15.591 --> 02:00:17.840
(growls)

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:19.220
Uh, six.

02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:20.083
11.

02:00:20.083 --> 02:00:21.069
Taliesin, it's you!

02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:22.600
No!
Yes!

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:25.557
I'm just gonna warn you, this is gonna hurt a lot.

02:00:25.557 --> 02:00:26.390
Oh, yay.

02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:28.540
This is gonna be pure chaos.

02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:29.730
Pure chaos.

02:00:29.730 --> 02:00:30.630
Okay.

02:00:30.630 --> 02:00:32.350
If it gets too bad, just don't forget:

02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:34.710
Taliesin's ideas come from here.

02:00:34.710 --> 02:00:35.670
Oh, yeah.

02:00:35.670 --> 02:00:36.703
Get in there!

00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:04.009
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome
to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.667
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:07.429
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.089
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.039
MATT: You dick. Left hook.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.792
Before we jump into tonight's game,

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:18.566
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:22.643
beginning with our first of two sponsors, Cortex. Sam.

00:00:22.643 --> 00:00:24.368
SAM: From our fans-- nope.

00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:25.776
From our friends at Fandom,

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:29.177
the people behind D&amp;D Beyond,
comes Cortex.

00:00:29.177 --> 00:00:31.228
It's not a new game, but rather a box of tools

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:33.081
you can use to craft your own game,

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:35.315
from hundreds of modular parts to best suit the way

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:37.358
you and your friends like to play.

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:41.010
Right now till December 31st, Critters can use the code--

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.244
I skipped a whole paragraph.

00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:43.333
Using a system--

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.583
(laughter)

00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:48.921
Using a system of dice and descriptive traits,

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.361
you have the freedom to build within your favorite genres

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:54.679
and worlds, from books, TVs, movies, and video games.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.126
And from now until December 31st,

00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:00.756
Critters can use the code, CORE20, at checkout

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:04.013
to get a 20% discount on the digital edition of the book.

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:08.538
Just go to cortexrpg.site,

00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:12.006
which is apparently a thing, /crcore, and grab a copy.

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.665
Now, last time I used Cortex to develop my own horror game,

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.315
Tax Code Carnage: IRS Annihilation,

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:21.620
but Ivan and the folks at Darrington Press rejected my idea.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.019
So this week I'm going to pitch a new one, it's called

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.505
Tea &amp; Tea.

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:29.171
Hold on.

00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:32.526
Steep yourself in an aromatic new RPG system.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:36.458
The first ever interactive tea-brewing adventure game!

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:39.218
Play as three soothing character classes,

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:44.126
Oolong, Assam, and if you're feeling nasty,

00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:45.659
Jasmine Matcha.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.611
(laughter)

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.286
Balance tannins, soak up caffeine,

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:55.286
and fight the evil forces of Lapsang Souchong.

00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:59.284
Super interactive! All you need is dice, a cup, hot water,

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:01.734
and a thirst for excitement.

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:02.567
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:06.379
SAM: Tea &amp; Tea is a truly immersive experience.

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:09.930
Here, I'll demonstrate one of the modules right now.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.046
Oh no! The evil Earl Gray has flooded the realm

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:17.599
with his undead bergamot bestiary.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.119
He's forcing us to eat scones without the créme fraíche.

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.892
That is, until Rooibos the Red attacks.

00:02:24.892 --> 00:02:25.725
ASHLEY: Oh!

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:28.966
SAM: Now, you roll a d4 to see how many minutes to steep.

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.728
It's a four. And now we wait.

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:36.585
(laughter)

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:40.543
(laughter)

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:43.778
I guess, I guess while we're waiting,

00:02:43.778 --> 00:02:45.370
what do you guys think?

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.094
LAURA: You know, it was really good.

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.418
LIAM: Strong, this is strong.

00:02:50.418 --> 00:02:51.326
SAM: Okay!

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:56.326
Well, I guess we'll check back later, see how it turns out.

00:02:56.952 --> 00:02:58.571
Until then, back to you, Matt.

00:02:58.571 --> 00:02:59.404
MATT: Thank you.

00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:00.656
No, I'm super--

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:03.335
SAM: Thanks to Cortex for sponsoring the show.

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:04.729
MATT: Thank you, Cortex.

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.575
I'm super excited to try out this game, and like,

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:08.441
run a one-shot for all of 2021.

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.008
(laughter)
TRAVIS: "For all of 2021."

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.215
MATT: But yes, thank you so much, Cortex, for sponsoring,

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:15.565
our friends at Fandom.

00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:19.704
Our second sponsor tonight is NordVPN.

00:03:19.704 --> 00:03:21.553
This episode-- as you know,

00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:23.544
they are the sponsors of the-- providers of the

00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:24.942
highest quality of encryption

00:03:24.942 --> 00:03:27.462
for your internet traffic and they hide your IP

00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:29.997
and physical location on the internet.

00:03:29.997 --> 00:03:31.869
Right now, they have a special Christmas deal going on,

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:33.940
with every purchase of a two-year plan,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.318
you get four additional months for free.

00:03:36.318 --> 00:03:37.943
That is four, that is the right numbers,

00:03:37.943 --> 00:03:39.472
of fingers I'm holding up.

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:42.640
But you can go to nordvpn.com/criticalrole right now

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.916

I recommend you do as well. Check it out when you can.

00:03:56.978 --> 00:04:00.963
NordVPN (deep exhale).

00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:02.196
For the rest of the announcements, we have a few things

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:04.074
to go through. First, beginning with Marisha.

00:04:04.074 --> 00:04:05.785
MARISHA: Oh my goodness, you guys.

00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:08.868
I've got announcements on this paper.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.228
The most important one:

00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:13.531
This is our last episode of the year.

00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:14.972
ALL: Aww!

00:04:14.972 --> 00:04:17.692
MARISHA: We're going on Christmas break or holiday break,

00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:20.964
or whatever you celebrate. We made it.

00:04:20.964 --> 00:04:24.455
Yeah. And we'll be returning for episode 121

00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:29.331
on Thursday, January 14th, is our next episode back.

00:04:29.331 --> 00:04:30.872
LAURA: Oh wow.
MARISHA: So.

00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:32.389
SAM: Oh, we get time off.
MARISHA: We will see you then.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.764
SAM: To travel-- Nope.

00:04:33.764 --> 00:04:35.358
MARISHA: Nope.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:39.569
Nope. Just wait it out a little longer.

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.168
Also, if you're watching this episode live on Twitch

00:04:42.168 --> 00:04:43.218
as it is airing,

00:04:43.218 --> 00:04:46.201
you should totally stay tuned during the break.

00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:48.986
We have a special viewing over our newest project,

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:52.079
which is Crit Recap Animated.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:53.106
(cheering)

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:56.260
Yeah, it's going to be airing during the break.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.160
Yeah, really excited about this one.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.759
Crit Recap Animated is a series of short videos

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.384
that's going to be breaking down our Mighty Nein arc in--

00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:08.917
sorry, our campaign in little arcs,

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:10.542
those are the words.

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:15.071
And it is a narrated by our local resident Lore Keeper,

00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.427
Dani Carr, who we all love.

00:05:17.427 --> 00:05:18.315
(cheering)

00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:21.906
Yeah, the episodes feature animation by Offworld Studios

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:22.898
and the writing team--

00:05:22.898 --> 00:05:25.148
Aww, they added the writing team

00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:28.892
of myself, Dani, and producer, Kyle Shire.

00:05:28.892 --> 00:05:30.395
(cheering)

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:32.138
Yeah, written in-house, of course.

00:05:32.138 --> 00:05:34.929
And yeah, our first episode is an introduction

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:37.053
to the characters of the Mighty Nein.

00:05:37.053 --> 00:05:38.628
So if you miss it live during the break,

00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:40.881
look for it on YouTube on Wednesday.

00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:43.303
Yeah. But we're hoping that these are little ways

00:05:43.303 --> 00:05:47.705
that people can quickly get caught up with the series

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:50.621
as they come out. That way you can pick up

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:55.621
as they come out and get refreshers on the arcs.

00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:59.197
It's super cute. You guys are going to love it.

00:05:59.197 --> 00:06:00.415
Those are my announcements.

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:01.956
MATT: Thank you, Marisha.
MARISHA: You're welcome.

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:03.497
LAURA: Good job, Marisha!
MARISHA: Thank you!

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:05.586
MATT: More announcements from Laura.

00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:06.886
Laura, go.

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:10.564
LAURA: This is just-- Hi guys.

00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:12.263
(laughter)

00:06:12.263 --> 00:06:15.811
So first thing I want to talk about is-- hold on.

00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:17.121
Should I take it off the hanger?

00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.511
SAM: Uh, maybe?

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.848
LAURA: No, I'll keep it on the hanger.

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:22.139
MATT: What?

00:06:23.158 --> 00:06:26.754
LAURA: Our Critical Role Cobalt Soul varsity jacket.

00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:27.739
TRAVIS: So good.

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:29.864
LAURA: Ooh, what?!

00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:33.977
Now you can be a Expositor in real life.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:34.927
MATT: That's really cool.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:37.798
LAURA: This is amazing, and it's available right now

00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:42.363
in our US, UK, and Australian shops.

00:06:42.363 --> 00:06:43.239
TRAVIS: Shops.

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:44.683
MARISHA: Mighty Nein patch.

00:06:44.683 --> 00:06:46.540
LAURA: Stores shops.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.607
Also, we-- get off me.

00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:55.415
Also, we recently announced our partnership with Sideshow.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.740
Also, we recently announced our partnership with Sideshow.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.399
You guys may know them as the amazing creators

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.683
of museum quality statues, and art prints,

00:07:03.683 --> 00:07:06.046
and figures, and all of that.

00:07:06.046 --> 00:07:08.536
And we have, I'm nervous because I'm so excited

00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:09.485
about these things.
MARISHA: I know.

00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:12.570
LAURA: We have our first releases in the studio today

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.409
that we're going to show you guys.

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.468
So first off we have our Mighty Nein--

00:07:17.468 --> 00:07:19.342
don't pull-- don't do anything yet.

00:07:19.342 --> 00:07:20.197
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:22.023
LAURA: Everybody just hold on.

00:07:22.023 --> 00:07:24.805
We have our Mighty Nein, "This Is How We Roll"

00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:28.225
fine art print by the incredible Ian MacDonald,

00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:32.104
which is available for pre-order right this moment.

00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:34.021
MATT: That's so awesome.

00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:35.567
MARISHA: Wait, does it come with the matting?

00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:37.152
LAURA: I think that's how it comes.

00:07:37.152 --> 00:07:38.461
MARISHA: Wait, what?!

00:07:38.461 --> 00:07:40.133
TRAVIS: That's beautiful. Holy shit.

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.235
LIAM: So gorgeous. I'll put this on my wall.

00:07:42.235 --> 00:07:43.885
LAURA: It's beautiful.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:07:43.885 --> 00:07:46.360
LAURA: Second, that I should talk about,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.276

00:07:49.276 --> 00:07:53.109

Whoa, you're so tall.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.833
You can pre-order our first two collectible figures,

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:03.957
Fjord and Beau!

00:08:03.957 --> 00:08:07.470
ALL: (excited noises)
MARISHA: Oh, you go first, you go first!

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.361
LIAM: Look at the beast!

00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:13.344
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:15.032
LAURA: You guys, they are so amazing.

00:08:15.032 --> 00:08:16.985
Yeah, bring it in Marisha, bring it in more

00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:18.046
so you can see them.

00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:19.128
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:08:19.128 --> 00:08:21.489
And the blue, I know--

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:25.152
I'll use my pasty arm as a backdrop.

00:08:25.152 --> 00:08:26.819
There we go.
TRAVIS: -- fucker.

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:27.855
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:08:27.855 --> 00:08:29.619
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.940
LAURA: Woo!

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.058
Fjord is so attractive.

00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:36.368
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: I don't want to drop him.

00:08:36.368 --> 00:08:38.374
He's casting a spell on you.

00:08:38.374 --> 00:08:39.332
(laughter)

00:08:39.332 --> 00:08:40.681
MATT: (exaggerated southern accent) Eldritch Blast.

00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:42.629
LAURA: So that's happening.

00:08:44.203 --> 00:08:47.083
Pretty amazing. More reveals are coming soon.

00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:52.083
Check out side.show/criticalrole

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:56.438
to RSVP to be notified of pre-order launches.

00:08:56.438 --> 00:08:59.216
SAM: Did you just say side dot show slash?

00:08:59.216 --> 00:09:01.209
LAURA: Side.show/

00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:02.992
SAM: That's their website, side.show?

00:09:02.992 --> 00:09:04.441
LAURA: That's what it says.
SAM: Cool.

00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:06.092
TRAVIS: That's awesome.

00:09:06.092 --> 00:09:07.008
Mercer and I were talking about this:

00:09:07.008 --> 00:09:10.249
First place we go when we go to Comic-Con every year

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:12.979
is the Sideshow booth, because it is the hottest thing ever.

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:14.563
So this is--
MATT: For years and years and years.

00:09:14.563 --> 00:09:17.270
TRAVIS: -- a crazy dream.
MATT: It really is.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.517
LIAM: You can zap a man's eye out
with that Fjord sword there.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.683
TRAVIS: And I will.
LIAM: Ah.

00:09:21.683 --> 00:09:23.288
(lip pop)

00:09:23.288 --> 00:09:24.121
MATT: Fantastic.
LAURA: So yeah.

00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:26.709
TRAVIS: It's real pretty!
LAURA: That's all I got.

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:29.179
MATT: Thank you guys. Ah, it's so cool!

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:31.222
SAM: Oh, Matt. Quick update by the way.

00:09:31.222 --> 00:09:32.619
MATT: Yeah? Where we at?

00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:33.747
LAURA: Oh. Oh.
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:09:33.747 --> 00:09:35.486
SAM: Over-steeped. I failed it.

00:09:35.486 --> 00:09:36.569
It was a fail.

00:09:36.569 --> 00:09:38.235
ASHLEY: No.
SAM: Sorry.

00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:39.601
MATT: That's okay. Well.

00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:40.434
SAM: I'll just roll again.

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:42.607
MATT: Yeah. Just roll up some new characters and we'll

00:09:42.607 --> 00:09:43.915
try a campaign.
SAM: That's the whole game.

00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:46.104
MATT: That's it, it's the entire thing.

00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:50.910
LIAM: Sam, that bit is in my Top 50 of your bits.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.198
SAM: That is high?

00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:55.906
That's medium praise! That's medium praise.

00:09:55.906 --> 00:09:57.658
MATT: Awesome.

00:09:57.658 --> 00:09:58.783
Last couple things here.

00:09:58.783 --> 00:09:59.716
Earlier this week, we announced

00:09:59.716 --> 00:10:01.376
our new comic book series with our friends at

00:10:01.376 --> 00:10:04.167
Dark Horse Comics, "Tales of Exandria."

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:06.111
This series actually expands a lot of the stories

00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:09.548
beyond the main campaign characters in the world of Exandria

00:10:09.548 --> 00:10:11.401
beyond Vox Machina and Mighty Nein,

00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:13.921
starting with a run centering on the Bright Queen

00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:18.269
written by Darcy Van Poelgeest, with art by CoupleOfKooks.

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:20.651
It is awesome, we've been working and developing

00:10:20.651 --> 00:10:23.456
the narrative, and Darcy's done an amazing job.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.285
And can't wait for you guys check it out,

00:10:26.285 --> 00:10:27.663
and you can see the art from a CoupleOfKooks,

00:10:27.663 --> 00:10:28.787
which their art's amazing.

00:10:28.787 --> 00:10:31.360

So keep an eye out. And that's it.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.417
It's lot to come back to the new year with!

00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:03.750
SAM: It's the last one of the year,

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.705
we got to get it all in.

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:07.318
MATT: Yeah, yeah. It's a great way to kick it off.

00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:09.755
Kick it off better than last year.
TRAVIS: Peace out, 2020.

00:11:09.755 --> 00:11:11.659
MARISHA: I just love these so much.

00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:13.421
TALIESIN: I know. I mean, look at them.
LIAM: How could you not?

00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:15.731
ASHLEY: Ugh, it's just--
LIAM: They're so fierce.

00:11:15.731 --> 00:11:18.531
LAURA: I know, I'm jealous that
they're the first two figures.

00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:19.764
MARISHA: Wait, I got an idea, I got an idea.

00:11:19.764 --> 00:11:21.166
This should be better.

00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:21.999
Here we go.

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:23.151
Yeah!

00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:25.235
LIAM: I want to see them side by side.

00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:26.681
SAM: I want to see them fight.

00:11:26.681 --> 00:11:28.139
MATT: We'll post pictures on socials and stuff.

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:29.114
LIAM: They'll break.
MATT: Yeah.

00:11:29.114 --> 00:11:31.149
TRAVIS: So dope. The detail is killer.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.137
LAURA: Yeah.

00:11:32.137 --> 00:11:34.410
MATT: But nevertheless, with that done, let's go ahead

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.493
and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:43.101
(water bubbling)

00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:44.949

(dragon roaring)

00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:18.591
MATT: And welcome back.

00:13:18.591 --> 00:13:20.624
So last we left off:

00:13:20.624 --> 00:13:23.939
The Mighty Nein, making their way through Eiselcross

00:13:23.939 --> 00:13:27.998
with the eventual destination plan of reaching the ruins,

00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:32.075
the central ruins of Aeor, which currently is to the east

00:13:32.075 --> 00:13:34.799
across a volcanic river of magma.

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:36.159
ASHLEY and LAURA: (like Dr. Evil) Magma.

00:13:36.159 --> 00:13:37.584
MATT: You have-- (laughs)

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:38.808
ASHLEY: Sorry.

00:13:38.808 --> 00:13:40.509
MATT: I missed you guys, too.

00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:41.782
MARISHA: It's gonna be one of those games.

00:13:41.782 --> 00:13:42.615
MATT: I know.

00:13:42.615 --> 00:13:45.053
We're already, out of the gate, loopy.

00:13:45.053 --> 00:13:46.243
But.

00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:49.599
You traveled here in trying to head off

00:13:49.599 --> 00:13:52.365
Lucien and the Tomb Takers for what seemed to be

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:54.340
one of the artifacts they're attempting to gather

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.420
before heading to Aeor themselves.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.696
You managed to gain some time by flying in the air

00:13:58.696 --> 00:14:02.288
via giant eagles, and upon trekking deep within,

00:14:02.288 --> 00:14:07.288
you encountered strange locales, ancient Aeorian citizens,

00:14:07.326 --> 00:14:10.650
frozen in some sort of weird, magical time bubble.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.763
You made yourself scarce as you went deeper into the ruin,

00:14:14.763 --> 00:14:18.272
discovering strange laboratories,

00:14:18.272 --> 00:14:22.874
encountering a horrifying, mutated abomination.

00:14:22.874 --> 00:14:24.860
After battling it, you discovered the remnants

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.712
of one of these laboratories and an eventual escape hatch

00:14:28.712 --> 00:14:31.692
that led to an even further subterranean,

00:14:31.692 --> 00:14:34.914
nearly petrified forest, corrupted by some sort

00:14:34.914 --> 00:14:38.900
of unknown source. But beyond that forest,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.900
you began to come upon a hallway and stairs that descended

00:14:43.902 --> 00:14:48.256
into a blue-lit chamber,

00:14:48.256 --> 00:14:49.732
in the same direction that Jester's magic

00:14:49.732 --> 00:14:53.944
had said the second threshold crest you seek would be.

00:14:53.944 --> 00:14:56.585
And so as we left off,

00:14:56.585 --> 00:14:59.524
you had just dispelled the magical barrier

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:03.425
that had prevented entry, and began trekking down,

00:15:03.425 --> 00:15:08.287
down the stairways into this blue-lit, familiar chamber.

00:15:08.287 --> 00:15:10.343
down the stairways into this blue-lit, familiar chamber.

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:12.209
MARISHA: Before we walk in.

00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:13.149
MATT: Okay.

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:16.693
MARISHA: I wanted to do this at the end of the last game,

00:15:16.693 --> 00:15:20.618
and just stop Yasha, because we're in the back.

00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:21.451
MATT: Okay.

00:15:22.886 --> 00:15:25.303
MARISHA: I'm really, really nervous.

00:15:26.623 --> 00:15:30.031
ASHLEY: Yeah. Really, really, really nervous.

00:15:31.644 --> 00:15:34.532
MARISHA: Oddly, it's not because of this.

00:15:34.532 --> 00:15:35.365
ASHLEY: Oh!

00:15:35.365 --> 00:15:38.740
MARISHA: It's-- you make me nervous,

00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:44.480
in a good way-- I've got cotton mouth-- in a good way.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.313
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:15:45.313 --> 00:15:48.058
MARISHA: I read your note.

00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:49.806
Y-y-yeah, no.

00:15:49.806 --> 00:15:54.358
ASHLEY: I thought I really fucked up and I just was like,

00:15:54.358 --> 00:15:57.433
was it too much? No, I just--

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:58.266
MARISHA: No.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:15:58.266 --> 00:15:59.099
MARISHA: It was great.

00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:00.826
ASHLEY: You did read it. I thought
maybe you didn't read it yet

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:03.697
or maybe you did, and you just were like, I don't want to--

00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:06.865
MARISHA: Yeah, it was like, I read it, but-- and then like,

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.061
we kept having house guests.

00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:11.706
Like we had the yetis, and then we had Dagen,

00:16:11.706 --> 00:16:13.444
and then we just kept bringing in weird people

00:16:13.444 --> 00:16:14.704
into the tower.

00:16:14.704 --> 00:16:15.541
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:17.773
MARISHA: So it was just like-- it was--
and then we'd be like, good night,

00:16:17.773 --> 00:16:21.606
and then we'd be like, ah, it-- I'm rambling.

00:16:24.603 --> 00:16:26.436
It's a weird question.

00:16:28.607 --> 00:16:31.271
But we might die soon.

00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:32.562
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:16:32.562 --> 00:16:36.562
MARISHA: Do you want to, like, go on a date or something?

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:41.798
ASHLEY: Yes, of course.

00:16:41.798 --> 00:16:43.467
MARISHA: Yeah? Okay.

00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:45.698
I never like do anything the right way,

00:16:45.698 --> 00:16:49.190
and so I figured that maybe with this, I should just go like

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.709
start from the beginning, and we haven't really had a beg-

00:16:52.709 --> 00:16:54.912
We had like a beginning and then we had like, like a,

00:16:54.912 --> 00:16:56.838
"You stabbed me" thing, and then,

00:16:56.838 --> 00:17:01.322
and then now we need like a second beginning.

00:17:01.322 --> 00:17:03.823
ASHLEY: I would love that more than anything.

00:17:03.823 --> 00:17:04.752
MARISHA: Okay.

00:17:04.752 --> 00:17:07.933
ASHLEY: And just-- Uh--

00:17:07.933 --> 00:17:11.000
Oh, I feel weirdly

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:16.933
happy and excited in this really weird place, but um--

00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:21.597
Wow, I feel really good.

00:17:21.597 --> 00:17:25.725
I think I just thought that, you know, when, when, when,

00:17:25.725 --> 00:17:30.593
when like, you start acting weird or stupid around someone?

00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:31.426
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:34.094
ASHLEY: And then you're just like,
why can't I just act normal?

00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:34.927
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:17:34.927 --> 00:17:39.792
ASHLEY: But I think, it's--

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:41.754
I like you, Beau.

00:17:41.754 --> 00:17:44.596
MARISHA: Yeah, I like you a lot, too.

00:17:47.648 --> 00:17:49.314
I dunno, we'll figure something out.

00:17:49.314 --> 00:17:51.906
I kind of asked Caleb if we could, like, change

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.382
the tower, you know?

00:17:53.382 --> 00:17:55.038
Because we're kind of in like a weird situation where

00:17:55.038 --> 00:17:58.638
I don't think there's bars, but I've got some ideas, so--

00:17:58.638 --> 00:17:59.471
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:18:00.582 --> 00:18:03.282
Yeah. I would love that.

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:04.215
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: If--

00:18:04.215 --> 00:18:06.831
MARISHA: Uh... (stammering)

00:18:06.831 --> 00:18:08.394
Tomorrow night? Is that too soon?

00:18:08.394 --> 00:18:11.398
Should we wait till the weekend? What day is it?

00:18:11.398 --> 00:18:12.321
ASHLEY: I don't even know.

00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:15.653
SAM: Yeah, we're all standing right next to you.

00:18:15.653 --> 00:18:17.174
MARISHA: No, you guys went ahead and I stopped her.

00:18:17.174 --> 00:18:18.007
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:19.691
MATT: Yeah, you guys have descended into the chamber.

00:18:19.691 --> 00:18:20.922
We'll get to you all in a second.

00:18:20.922 --> 00:18:23.011
TRAVIS: We might be like--
LIAM: Much less fun.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.703
TALIESIN: I have a perception of 20;
I'm listening to this. Yeah.

00:18:26.703 --> 00:18:27.655
Sorry.

00:18:27.655 --> 00:18:28.613
ASHLEY: If--

00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:33.145
If we live, let's go on a date tomorrow night.

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.479
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

00:18:34.479 --> 00:18:35.312
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:18:35.312 --> 00:18:37.718
ASHLEY: I mean, we'll see. If we're still in here,

00:18:37.718 --> 00:18:38.551
we'll figure it out.

00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:40.500
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, we got some time.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.948
We'll, as we're trekking through the tundra

00:18:42.948 --> 00:18:46.756
and saving the universe, we'll make plans.

00:18:46.756 --> 00:18:49.752
ASHLEY: And then if we go on the date and you're, like,

00:18:49.752 --> 00:18:51.481
not into it anymore, that's okay too.

00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:52.955
MARISHA: Yeah, same!
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

00:18:52.955 --> 00:18:54.326
MARISHA: Like, no-- I don't want to make it weird,

00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:57.553
you know? Because we're like, working together.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.977
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's weird.

00:18:58.977 --> 00:19:01.928
But I-- wow, I don't even know what to say.

00:19:01.928 --> 00:19:05.195
I was not expecting that, but--

00:19:05.195 --> 00:19:08.894
MARISHA: I wanted to ask you earlier,
but it just kind of, just--

00:19:08.894 --> 00:19:10.538
I'm sweating.

00:19:10.538 --> 00:19:12.372
ASHLEY: Yeah. Me, too. I get really squirrely.

00:19:12.372 --> 00:19:13.632
MARISHA: It's like--

00:19:13.632 --> 00:19:14.909
ASHLEY: Nervous.

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:17.379
But you look great. It's like-- you have a very nice dew.

00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:18.596
MARISHA: (breathless laugh)

00:19:20.578 --> 00:19:21.411
Thanks.

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:25.364
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, I'm looking forward to it.

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:26.418
Stay alive, please.

00:19:26.418 --> 00:19:27.325
MARISHA: Yeah, you, too.

00:19:27.325 --> 00:19:28.254
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:19:28.254 --> 00:19:29.837
MARISHA: Let's go

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:31.754
steal an ancient relic.

00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:33.892
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:19:33.892 --> 00:19:35.400
MARISHA: (stammering)

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.194
After you.

00:19:37.194 --> 00:19:38.860
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.011
ASHLEY: I walk away and try to look really cute.

00:19:42.011 --> 00:19:44.393
(laughter)

00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:45.460
TRAVIS: "Really cute."

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.701
ASHLEY: Like move my hips a little bit more,

00:19:47.701 --> 00:19:50.292
MARISHA: I just, like, wipe the spittle that gathered

00:19:50.292 --> 00:19:52.126
in the corner of my mouth.

00:19:53.784 --> 00:19:56.151
And then I go forward.

00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:59.257
MATT: As you strut your way behind your compatriot--

00:19:59.257 --> 00:20:00.445
ASHLEY: Hey, what are we doing?

00:20:00.445 --> 00:20:03.385
Are we all figured-- you know, we got to figure it out.

00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:04.394
SAM: Well, we thought that you guys

00:20:04.394 --> 00:20:05.964
were talking strategy. It seemed like

00:20:05.964 --> 00:20:07.359
an intense conversation.

00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:08.800
MARISHA: It was a str- It's a strategy

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.042
of a different kind.
LAURA: So what's the plan?

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.992
SAM: Yeah, what did you guys come up with?

00:20:11.992 --> 00:20:13.305
TRAVIS: You were gone for a while, so.

00:20:13.305 --> 00:20:14.138
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:14.138 --> 00:20:16.803
MARISHA: The plan is to stay alive.

00:20:16.803 --> 00:20:18.063
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:20:18.063 --> 00:20:19.467
MARISHA: Until tomorrow night.

00:20:19.467 --> 00:20:20.609
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:20:20.609 --> 00:20:23.281
SAM: You had a much more intricate, like, thing

00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:27.324
before we went into the last one of these places,

00:20:27.324 --> 00:20:30.087
it was like, you wanted to talk and be allies

00:20:30.087 --> 00:20:33.425
and all sorts of stuff. This is just, stay alive?

00:20:33.425 --> 00:20:34.554
MARISHA: Hmm.
ASHLEY: Well, you know--

00:20:34.554 --> 00:20:36.553
MARISHA: Lucien's not here and now it's

00:20:36.553 --> 00:20:38.070
just get the job done, right?

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.157
And just, like, make it, and just live in the moment, yeah?

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.307
LIAM: Here, take this handkerchief.

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:44.173
You are oddly sweating in this cold place.

00:20:44.173 --> 00:20:45.492
MARISHA: I know. It's--

00:20:45.492 --> 00:20:47.840
LAURA: Yeah, you look like my dad.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.673
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.334
LAURA: No, it's a good thing.
TRAVIS: You feeling all right?

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.167
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:55.608
TRAVIS: You were farting back there, weren't you?

00:20:55.608 --> 00:21:00.169
MARISHA: I didn't want to infect the room, you know.

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:01.591
We're kind of in a--

00:21:01.591 --> 00:21:02.424
TRAVIS: It's very considerate.

00:21:02.424 --> 00:21:04.473
MARISHA: It's limited oxygen down here, I didn't want to--

00:21:04.473 --> 00:21:08.470
ASHLEY: Weirdly, because I can't
smell her farts for some reason.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.756
So she held me back just to stay with her in the, well,

00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:12.971
she had tummy issues.

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.793
TRAVIS: A very unique trait, Yasha.

00:21:14.793 --> 00:21:16.001
SAM: Is that like some people--

00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:18.843
LIAM: It's that crayon smell. It's very overpowering.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.727
ASHLEY: It's just farts, I don't know.

00:21:24.264 --> 00:21:26.798
Because flowers, you know.

00:21:26.798 --> 00:21:29.689
SAM: I think I've heard of that. It's like some people pee,

00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:31.496
when they eat asparagus, it smells funny.

00:21:31.496 --> 00:21:33.577
Some people just can't smell farts.

00:21:33.577 --> 00:21:34.801
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: It's a genetic thing.

00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.419
ASHLEY: It's just, it's-- It's a weird thing.

00:21:37.419 --> 00:21:38.252
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah.

00:21:38.252 --> 00:21:41.780
TRAVIS: If you got to drop a bomb, Yasha is your wingman.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.625
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:45.875
MATT: So as you take in the environment around you...

00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:47.544
(laughter)

00:21:47.544 --> 00:21:49.551
LIAM: Just like we did in rehearsal, Matt.

00:21:49.551 --> 00:21:52.809
(laughter)

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.311
MATT: Having this conversation,

00:21:55.311 --> 00:21:58.937
as you slowly descend the staircase into a familiar chamber.

00:21:58.937 --> 00:22:03.195
This is a room that is nearly identical to the previous

00:22:03.195 --> 00:22:05.732
Threshold Vault that you had encountered at

00:22:05.732 --> 00:22:07.899
the site of A5 on the map.

00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:12.644
The shape's a little bit larger of the overall chamber.

00:22:12.644 --> 00:22:17.056
You can see there are the two somewhat

00:22:17.056 --> 00:22:20.196
rounded balcony edges that go to the right and left

00:22:20.196 --> 00:22:22.011
and in the stairs that descend in the central chamber,

00:22:22.011 --> 00:22:24.190
and the central part of stairs that go towards

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:27.006
the middle of the chamber.

00:22:27.006 --> 00:22:29.600
And there below you can see the familiar sigils in the floor

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.248
and the glyph against the wall.

00:22:31.248 --> 00:22:34.109
And there above, affixed to the ceiling, you see embedded

00:22:34.109 --> 00:22:37.743
the large blue, glowing threshold crest.

00:22:37.743 --> 00:22:39.634
There is a lot of fallen rubble in here

00:22:39.634 --> 00:22:43.524
and you can see there are a couple of heavy stacks or piles

00:22:43.524 --> 00:22:48.509
of rock, stone, and other structural materials

00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:52.946
that have fallen. But overall, the room is holding.

00:22:52.946 --> 00:22:55.673
LIAM: Well, I know this looks very much like the last one,

00:22:55.673 --> 00:22:58.276
but let's not take it for granted, and start looking

00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:01.020
around for any threats in the room.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.171
TRAVIS: Any sort of inlaid statues or things that could

00:23:03.171 --> 00:23:05.619
come to life, or traps.

00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:06.452
LIAM: Or zap us.

00:23:06.452 --> 00:23:07.717
MATT: Well, you can make a perception check.

00:23:07.717 --> 00:23:09.609
You do see at the--
TRAVIS: Assist you.

00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:12.257
MATT: Perception check.

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:15.193
LIAM: Can I go full on poke about with an investigation,

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:16.866
or is that too involved?

00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:18.045
MATT: If you want to, like, spend the time

00:23:18.045 --> 00:23:19.180
rummaging through stuff, sure,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.305
make an investigation check, then.

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:27.651
LIAM: It is-- where is investigation? It is in 18.

00:23:27.651 --> 00:23:28.995
MATT: 18. Okay. So it'll take you a little while,

00:23:28.995 --> 00:23:29.929
so while you're doing that--

00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:30.762
LIAM: Okay.

00:23:31.848 --> 00:23:33.809
MATT: There are the two curved staircases

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:35.367
that head into the middle chamber on the side.

00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:38.098
And then at the base of each of those, you see pillars

00:23:38.098 --> 00:23:40.537
that have orbs on them that are just these

00:23:40.537 --> 00:23:43.927
hollow, dark, glassed orb.

00:23:43.927 --> 00:23:46.158
Somewhat frosted, it seems like, from the inside.

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:47.824
SAM: That seems bad.

00:23:47.824 --> 00:23:48.657
ASHLEY: Yup.

00:23:48.657 --> 00:23:52.062
SAM: I'll go down towards one of those and specifically

00:23:52.062 --> 00:23:54.787
check it for traps.

00:23:54.787 --> 00:23:58.670
Hmm, maybe someone should scan it for magic first.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.946
TALIESIN: Are we close enough in for Detect Magic to...?

00:24:01.946 --> 00:24:02.779
MATT: Likely.

00:24:02.779 --> 00:24:05.954
TALIESIN: All right. I'll do a Detect Magic.

00:24:05.954 --> 00:24:07.454
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: So yeah.

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:13.200
MATT: So you Detect Magic in the chamber. There is magic

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.766
throughout a majority of this chamber. You see threads woven

00:24:16.766 --> 00:24:21.766
like small subterranean roots and trees that seem to mingle

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.898
and all gather towards the base of the ground,

00:24:24.898 --> 00:24:27.393
and then weave within this glyph that then folds up

00:24:27.393 --> 00:24:29.894
into the top. And that heavy, heavy magical source

00:24:29.894 --> 00:24:34.116
from the central crest, it is nearly blinding,

00:24:34.116 --> 00:24:37.058
and even just extending your consciousness

00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:40.483
to accept this, is a little harsh.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.690
As you were investigating and looking around

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.440
the area, the two orbs in the sides,

00:24:49.397 --> 00:24:51.025
they just briefly flash and then go back

00:24:51.025 --> 00:24:54.240
to a dull sensation. You sense a brief flash

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.240
of magical energy, and then they just go inert.

00:25:00.466 --> 00:25:02.195
TALIESIN: That was something. There's nothing now,

00:25:02.195 --> 00:25:03.403
but that was something.

00:25:03.403 --> 00:25:04.236
LAURA: What?

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:08.653
TALIESIN: Oh, the orbs just sort of--
they had a magic moment.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.734
(laughter)

00:25:11.734 --> 00:25:13.052
TRAVIS: The regret.

00:25:13.052 --> 00:25:14.803
(loud laughing)

00:25:14.803 --> 00:25:17.424
MATT: That's why I'm trying to pull you back in.

00:25:17.424 --> 00:25:19.631
TRAVIS: Tractor beams failing.

00:25:19.631 --> 00:25:21.973
LIAM: You're still thinking about Beau and Yasha.

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:28.576
TALIESIN: I think we should be careful. This seems--

00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:29.409
TRAVIS: Dangerous.

00:25:29.409 --> 00:25:30.706
TALIESIN: I'm not getting anything from them now,

00:25:30.706 --> 00:25:33.701
but there was a brief flash of something, I don't know.

00:25:33.701 --> 00:25:36.238
And this whole room is just lit up.

00:25:36.238 --> 00:25:38.679
LAURA: Do we have to cross between the two orbs in order

00:25:38.679 --> 00:25:41.611
to get to the Threshold Crest?

00:25:41.611 --> 00:25:45.348
MATT: The staircases would descend around them,

00:25:45.348 --> 00:25:47.577
but the central stairs would go between the two of them.

00:25:47.577 --> 00:25:48.410
Yes.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.005
LAURA: I'm going to around them, I'm not going to walk

00:25:50.005 --> 00:25:51.112
between them.

00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:51.945
MATT: Okay.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.890
As you guys all make your way down

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.968
to the lower area and you are currently

00:25:57.968 --> 00:26:01.343
rummaging through them, there is piles of loose rock

00:26:01.343 --> 00:26:04.124
and fallen stone and materials that either belonged

00:26:04.124 --> 00:26:06.870
to the structure here, or have since slid into it

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.620
at some point due to the impact of this ruin.

00:26:11.531 --> 00:26:14.204
But you do see an armored hand

00:26:14.204 --> 00:26:17.752
that is loosely visible near one of the piles of stone

00:26:17.752 --> 00:26:22.157
on the far left hand corner of this room.

00:26:22.157 --> 00:26:24.307
LIAM: All right. Caduceus!

00:26:24.307 --> 00:26:27.312
TALIESIN: I can see from here, is that weird?

00:26:27.312 --> 00:26:29.183
Is it magic?

00:26:29.183 --> 00:26:32.107
MATT: It does not appear to emit a magical aura.

00:26:32.107 --> 00:26:35.652
TALIESIN: Just a hand, or at least
just a glove. I don't know,

00:26:35.652 --> 00:26:37.705
is there anything in it?

00:26:37.705 --> 00:26:39.518
LIAM: Yeah. For safety, here.

00:26:39.518 --> 00:26:43.519
SAM: Sure. I'll come over and I'll cast my magic hand

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:46.621
and just try to, sort of, tug on it from 30 feet away

00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:48.496
and see if it moves or--

00:26:48.496 --> 00:26:52.131
MATT: I mean, it lifts with it, like it's being lifted

00:26:52.131 --> 00:26:54.074
from its place, but is attached.

00:26:54.074 --> 00:26:56.551
SAM: Okay. It's not just a hand. There's a body in there.

00:26:56.551 --> 00:27:00.648
So I'll come closer and investigate to see if it's trapped.

00:27:00.648 --> 00:27:03.065
MATT: Go ahead and check and see.

00:27:04.032 --> 00:27:05.382
SAM: 12 plus--

00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:08.234
25.

00:27:08.234 --> 00:27:11.239
MATT: 25. All righty. It does not appear to be trapped.

00:27:11.239 --> 00:27:12.950
It does appear to be buried.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.991
Whatever it's attached to is currently under

00:27:14.991 --> 00:27:16.134
quite a bit of stone.

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:17.467
TALIESIN: Detect Undead.

00:27:18.439 --> 00:27:21.111
MATT: You get no undead essence in the vicinity.

00:27:21.111 --> 00:27:22.277
TALIESIN: All right.
TRAVIS: Divine Sense

00:27:22.277 --> 00:27:24.469
for celestial and fiend?
SAM: Wow, we are being super careful.

00:27:24.469 --> 00:27:27.695
LAURA: Yeah, we are being so careful.
MATT: (multiple firing noises)

00:27:27.695 --> 00:27:29.187
I love it.

00:27:29.187 --> 00:27:31.068
Nothing catches your attention.

00:27:31.068 --> 00:27:32.544
ASHLEY: Nott, do you want me to come--

00:27:32.544 --> 00:27:34.369
do we want to unbury this thing?
SAM: Do you need help

00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:35.719
to dig it out?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:27:37.619 --> 00:27:40.958
I'll try to-- yeah, do we want to look at this thing?

00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:41.928
SAM: Let's see what this is.

00:27:41.928 --> 00:27:43.205
MATT: It'll take you a bit,

00:27:43.205 --> 00:27:45.418
but you don't have to roll for it necessarily.

00:27:45.418 --> 00:27:46.726
With the aid of your friends, you managed to pull

00:27:46.726 --> 00:27:50.578
some of this off and you see some sort of--

00:27:50.578 --> 00:27:52.368
you think it's a soldier in armor at first,

00:27:52.368 --> 00:27:57.302
but the armor pieces are bolted or sealed onto the body.

00:27:59.405 --> 00:28:00.988
You don't see skin.

00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:04.239
LAURA: Is it a golem?

00:28:04.239 --> 00:28:05.832
LIAM: Is it a Willi arm?

00:28:05.832 --> 00:28:07.191
SAM: A what?

00:28:07.191 --> 00:28:08.424
LIAM: Like the golem from--

00:28:08.424 --> 00:28:09.684
MARISHA: Willi.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:28:09.684 --> 00:28:10.517
SAM: Oh, oh.

00:28:10.517 --> 00:28:13.392
MATT: It resembles an automaton
that you've encountered before,

00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:16.325
but this one is more humanoid in size.

00:28:16.325 --> 00:28:21.325
It's maybe about-- I'd say a little bit shorter

00:28:21.627 --> 00:28:25.721
than Caduceus and has the proportions of a human,

00:28:25.721 --> 00:28:28.810
but it looks like it's crafted from enchanted metals,

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.425
and stone, and other weird rubbery materials,

00:28:32.425 --> 00:28:34.523
similar to the cables that you saw torn

00:28:34.523 --> 00:28:36.390
through some of the chambers and walls on your way in.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.679
LAURA: What does his face look like?

00:28:38.679 --> 00:28:40.216
MATT: As you pull it over, you see the face,

00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:43.665
the face looks smooth. There's no hair.

00:28:43.665 --> 00:28:48.665
It's just a metallic dome, almost like a helmet.

00:28:49.065 --> 00:28:52.024
But you can see there are sockets where eyes would be,

00:28:52.024 --> 00:28:54.400
and an area where a mouth would be that looks like it has

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.983
some sort of a joint to it, like a jaw,

00:28:57.983 --> 00:29:00.189
but it is partially crushed inward.

00:29:00.189 --> 00:29:03.069
TRAVIS: Should we leave this buried?
It's going to come to life and--

00:29:03.069 --> 00:29:03.902
LIAM: Actually--

00:29:03.902 --> 00:29:05.259
LAURA: What if it's a buddy?

00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:06.711
LIAM: I'm going to kneel down and start seeing

00:29:06.711 --> 00:29:09.303
if there is any sort of power source,

00:29:09.303 --> 00:29:12.748
the likes of which I've read about and which

00:29:12.748 --> 00:29:17.748
I've been hoping for, ever since the Folding Halls of Halas.

00:29:18.562 --> 00:29:19.879
MATT: Go ahead and make an arcana check.

00:29:19.879 --> 00:29:20.712
LIAM: Yeah.

00:29:20.712 --> 00:29:23.632
LAURA: What, like a charger or--

00:29:23.632 --> 00:29:25.503
SAM: Battery.
LAURA: Battery of some sort.

00:29:25.503 --> 00:29:26.526
LIAM: 15.

00:29:26.526 --> 00:29:28.563
MATT: 15.
LIAM: I rolled low.

00:29:28.563 --> 00:29:30.967
MATT: Looking at this, and from
the knowledge that you did gain

00:29:30.967 --> 00:29:34.361
from actually crafting with your friends here,

00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:38.033
that golem within the Folding Halls,

00:29:38.033 --> 00:29:40.327
this is a different physicality to it.

00:29:40.327 --> 00:29:45.327
It's weirdly far more complicated than the simple--

00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:48.484
comparatively simple golem creations.

00:29:49.418 --> 00:29:52.603
This has more maneuverability.

00:29:52.603 --> 00:29:56.520
Its joints are more natural. It's almost a--

00:29:58.066 --> 00:30:02.599
an imitation of a human body, but crafted.

00:30:03.856 --> 00:30:08.002
You can see within the armor, there are grooves and runes,

00:30:08.002 --> 00:30:10.635
so there was some sort of enchantment, though it appears

00:30:10.635 --> 00:30:13.967
to be bereft of any sort of life or source.

00:30:13.967 --> 00:30:15.063
LIAM: Is there any language on it?

00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:17.000
I still have Comprehend Languages up.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.835
MATT: There is no language written on it, no.

00:30:19.835 --> 00:30:23.269
LIAM: I pull out the collar that got thrown around my neck

00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:24.685
and say: I'm looking for something

00:30:24.685 --> 00:30:29.281
to bring this back to life, and I think if we are lucky

00:30:29.281 --> 00:30:30.927
somewhere here, I might.

00:30:30.927 --> 00:30:32.218
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: Maybe.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.607
TALIESIN: The orbs haven't flashed again, have they?

00:30:36.607 --> 00:30:37.440
MATT: No.

00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:41.971
LAURA: If you get close to them, do they flash?

00:30:41.971 --> 00:30:44.464
MATT: Do you want to walk close to it?

00:30:44.464 --> 00:30:47.507
LAURA: How close was-- was it Caleb who was--

00:30:47.507 --> 00:30:49.874
is anybody close to it before when it flashed?

00:30:49.874 --> 00:30:50.707
LIAM: It was me.

00:30:50.707 --> 00:30:51.725
MATT: Yeah, you were all moving in,

00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:53.083
but it was Caleb who was the first to go in

00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:54.955
and begin, like, looking through and searching

00:30:54.955 --> 00:30:56.064
the local rubble and such.

00:30:56.064 --> 00:30:59.097
LAURA: I'll get within...

00:30:59.097 --> 00:31:02.156
TRAVIS: Or I could do it. You don't-- you know, just

00:31:02.156 --> 00:31:02.989
maybe not you.

00:31:02.989 --> 00:31:04.419
LAURA: I'm really strong, Fjord.

00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:07.588
TRAVIS: There's no doubt. Sure.

00:31:07.588 --> 00:31:10.026
TALIESIN: Someone with-- Can you still teleport?

00:31:10.026 --> 00:31:11.476
Can you still jump?

00:31:11.476 --> 00:31:12.601
LAURA: Me?

00:31:12.601 --> 00:31:14.544
TALIESIN: Either of you, honestly.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:31:14.544 --> 00:31:15.377
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.041
This place is giving me feels.

00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:22.456
LAURA: I'll get within--

00:31:22.456 --> 00:31:25.011
Oh, I'm about to sneeze.

00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:26.923
Oh, it went away.

00:31:26.923 --> 00:31:29.098
MATT: Ah! Ooh!
LAURA: It went away!

00:31:29.098 --> 00:31:31.365
I'll get within

00:31:31.365 --> 00:31:32.561
20 feet of the orbs.

00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:33.788
LIAM: Look at the crystal in the ceiling.

00:31:33.788 --> 00:31:35.396
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:31:35.396 --> 00:31:37.951
MATT: 20 feet is relatively easy because of the space

00:31:37.951 --> 00:31:39.230
where you guys are even inspecting

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.783
this crushed construction was about 20 feet.

00:31:43.783 --> 00:31:46.797
So you step closer, still nothing, no reaction.

00:31:46.797 --> 00:31:48.148
LAURA: 15 feet.

00:31:48.148 --> 00:31:49.588
MATT: No reaction.

00:31:49.588 --> 00:31:50.421
LAURA: Hmm.

00:31:51.379 --> 00:31:52.599
10 feet.

00:31:52.599 --> 00:31:53.580
MATT: No reaction.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.617
LAURA: What the heck, man. How close was Caleb?

00:31:55.617 --> 00:31:56.624
TALIESIN: I don't remember.

00:31:56.624 --> 00:31:59.342
MATT: He was about, maybe, 15 to 10 feet from it.

00:31:59.342 --> 00:32:00.175
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:32:01.764 --> 00:32:05.157
Well, how are we going to get this crest?

00:32:05.157 --> 00:32:08.064
LAURA: Well, we could, you know, you could spider climb

00:32:08.064 --> 00:32:10.204
up to the ceiling and we could try to pry it out.

00:32:10.204 --> 00:32:12.158
Somebody could fly up and we could--

00:32:12.158 --> 00:32:14.001
SAM: What did we see when we walked into

00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:16.629
the last one of these? How were they getting it down?

00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:17.462
LIAM: They cut it down.

00:32:17.462 --> 00:32:18.295
TRAVIS: Prying it out.

00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:21.164
LIAM: I could probably get it, if we take a moment.

00:32:21.164 --> 00:32:22.746
I could get it the same way.

00:32:22.746 --> 00:32:25.829
You've seen me pulverize gems, and--

00:32:27.171 --> 00:32:28.599
TALIESIN: Let's just keep an eye out, and stay as far away

00:32:28.599 --> 00:32:30.452
from it as possible.

00:32:30.452 --> 00:32:32.638
LAURA: What if we just try to dispel it, you know,

00:32:32.638 --> 00:32:33.563
just make it inert.

00:32:33.563 --> 00:32:35.507
SAM: I don't think we have that much magic, do we?

00:32:35.507 --> 00:32:37.007
This thing's huge.

00:32:38.387 --> 00:32:39.872
LAURA: We can always try.
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:32:39.872 --> 00:32:41.924
LAURA: It'd take a really high level, but--

00:32:41.924 --> 00:32:45.100
TALIESIN: Better to save that for
getting out of here, I think.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.784
TRAVIS: But we don't want to make it inert, right?

00:32:46.784 --> 00:32:48.584
I mean, we want to remove it.

00:32:48.584 --> 00:32:51.208
LAURA: Why wouldn't we want to make it inert?

00:32:51.208 --> 00:32:52.677
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

00:32:52.677 --> 00:32:54.616
SAM: Because then it's not a bargaining chip anymore.

00:32:54.616 --> 00:32:56.832
LAURA: Yeah, but why would we bargain with them?

00:32:56.832 --> 00:32:58.823
What would we bargain for it? You know what I mean?

00:32:58.823 --> 00:33:01.863
SAM: I don't know. We won't know until we get to that point.

00:33:01.863 --> 00:33:03.333
LIAM: You want to destroy it?

00:33:03.333 --> 00:33:04.717
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:04.717 --> 00:33:07.381
If we keep it not broken,

00:33:07.381 --> 00:33:09.757
then they have the opportunity to use it.

00:33:09.757 --> 00:33:11.576
SAM: But if we break it, then they can just say,

00:33:11.576 --> 00:33:14.104
"Oh, well, I'll go get another one, then."

00:33:14.104 --> 00:33:18.021
TALIESIN: I say we get it out of here then we break it.

00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:18.947
I don't want to--

00:33:18.947 --> 00:33:20.377
TRAVIS: Spend time?

00:33:20.377 --> 00:33:21.618
TALIESIN: I want to get out of here quickly,

00:33:21.618 --> 00:33:24.060
and I want to make sure that we get out of here

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.310
with everything we need.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.739
I'm afraid that it's going to be hard to leave.

00:33:28.739 --> 00:33:30.747
LAURA: I just think if we get it out,

00:33:30.747 --> 00:33:33.030
we use a lot of power doing it,

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.888
they happen upon us, we're already weakened,

00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:39.735
they take it from us, and then we did the work for them.

00:33:39.735 --> 00:33:41.627
TALIESIN: It's possible.

00:33:41.627 --> 00:33:45.073
SAM: You know what we should've done? That guy up above

00:33:45.073 --> 00:33:48.395
the gnome. Iver, Eever, Eever, Iver.

00:33:48.395 --> 00:33:50.997
The guy that we've met when we entered this?

00:33:50.997 --> 00:33:52.295
TRAVIS: Yep.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

00:33:52.295 --> 00:33:54.217
SAM: We should have fucking wiped his memory,

00:33:54.217 --> 00:33:56.530
so he didn't remember seeing us,

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.636
because if people come down, they're going to be like,

00:33:58.636 --> 00:33:59.716
"Where are you're friends?"

00:33:59.716 --> 00:34:02.155
And he's going to be like, "They went that way." Fuck.

00:34:02.155 --> 00:34:03.755
TALIESIN: I think they know.

00:34:03.755 --> 00:34:06.686
MARISHA: We told him that bad people
might be coming and to hide.

00:34:06.686 --> 00:34:07.786
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Said he was going to hide.

00:34:07.786 --> 00:34:10.700
TALIESIN: And they can watch us any time they like,

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.679
they probably know we're--

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.288
SAM: Oh, yeah? Are they watching us now?

00:34:13.288 --> 00:34:14.955
TRAVIS: Mm. I don't know.

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:17.698
SAM: Why don't you

00:34:17.698 --> 00:34:19.276
find out?

00:34:19.276 --> 00:34:20.428
TRAVIS: That's fair.

00:34:20.428 --> 00:34:22.423
I feel like I use it rather frivolously.

00:34:22.423 --> 00:34:23.920
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh, and I think I've used it--

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.945
MATT: I think you've already used it today.

00:34:24.945 --> 00:34:27.140
LAURA: Yeah, because we've used
a lot of spells already today.

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.247
TALIESIN: This is precisely why we shouldn't try

00:34:29.247 --> 00:34:32.225
and destroy it here. We should destroy it once we're--

00:34:32.225 --> 00:34:33.533
TRAVIS: Let's get it out first. Let's get it.

00:34:33.533 --> 00:34:36.367
TALIESIN: It's probably going to need more than we have.

00:34:36.367 --> 00:34:37.200
LAURA: Okay.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.938
LIAM: Well, I think I can get it out of the ceiling.

00:34:39.988 --> 00:34:42.507
It's going to take me about 10 minutes.

00:34:42.507 --> 00:34:44.226
We probably want to wait to catch it, unless we want to see

00:34:44.226 --> 00:34:46.206
if it smashes when it hits the ground.

00:34:46.206 --> 00:34:47.294
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

00:34:47.294 --> 00:34:50.310
LAURA: Yeah. Let's just try to get it smashed.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:51.570
TALIESIN: It smashes, it smashes.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.696
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:34:52.696 --> 00:34:54.677
MARISHA: Fine with that.

00:34:54.677 --> 00:34:57.105
LIAM: Okay, so I will go, not directly beneath it,

00:34:57.105 --> 00:35:00.447
so I do not get crushed, but just 10 feet out

00:35:00.447 --> 00:35:03.795
and spend 10 minutes and I will cast the spell Fabricate

00:35:03.795 --> 00:35:08.795
and I will use that to meld the stone that's holding it

00:35:08.823 --> 00:35:10.710
away from the gem.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.201
Just sort of (sucking sound)

00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:13.193
hollow out.

00:35:13.193 --> 00:35:14.399
MATT: All righty.

00:35:14.399 --> 00:35:17.273
TRAVIS: Let's see if these columns react to magic.

00:35:17.273 --> 00:35:19.234
LAURA: Yeah. I'll stand pretty far away.

00:35:19.234 --> 00:35:23.132
Maybe in the door. I'm going to stand in the doorway.

00:35:23.132 --> 00:35:26.732
SAM: I'm going to lie underneath, or next to that robot man.

00:35:26.732 --> 00:35:28.711
He seemed like he was in a safe place.

00:35:28.711 --> 00:35:31.186
(laughter)

00:35:31.186 --> 00:35:32.429
LAURA: He was crushed.

00:35:32.429 --> 00:35:33.850
TRAVIS: Whatever happened there,

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.510
the worst already happened.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.843
SAM: Lightning doesn't strike the same place twice.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:39.723
TALIESIN: Ehh.

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:46.102
MATT: Okay. Fabricate, just is less of a shape as it is

00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:48.624
and more of taking raw materials and then building

00:35:48.624 --> 00:35:52.250
them into an actual constructed object.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.517
LIAM: If I could, it's up to you, but if I can take pieces

00:35:55.517 --> 00:35:57.317
of wood and make them "Vroop!",

00:35:57.317 --> 00:35:59.469
couldn't I do the reverse and go "Vroop!" and just make

00:35:59.469 --> 00:36:02.488
the shape a wider, bubbled--

00:36:02.488 --> 00:36:05.155
MATT: I would say, come up with a--

00:36:07.386 --> 00:36:12.386
Currently, the spell requires a final visualized structure.

00:36:12.652 --> 00:36:15.747
LIAM: I have it. I will make a sort of stone lattice work

00:36:15.747 --> 00:36:18.140
bubble underneath where the gem is.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.172
So all the stone around it will drip down

00:36:20.172 --> 00:36:22.892
and make like a thin spider web of stone

00:36:22.892 --> 00:36:24.754
that will either catch it or smash through.

00:36:24.754 --> 00:36:25.674
MATT: That'll work.

00:36:25.674 --> 00:36:29.257
SAM: Wait, do we want to catch it? Because I could catch it.

00:36:29.257 --> 00:36:30.513
LIAM: We've got 10 minutes to think about it.

00:36:30.513 --> 00:36:32.159
TRAVIS: It's up to you.

00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:35.523
SAM: Okay, I can cast Levitate then and catch it,

00:36:35.523 --> 00:36:36.764
if you want me to.

00:36:36.764 --> 00:36:37.655
LIAM: That sounds good.

00:36:37.655 --> 00:36:38.491
MATT: Okay.

00:36:38.491 --> 00:36:39.699
MARISHA: Or we could just see if it smash--

00:36:39.699 --> 00:36:41.454
LAURA: Or we could try to break it.

00:36:41.454 --> 00:36:42.687
SAM: Do we want it? Okay.

00:36:42.687 --> 00:36:44.406
Well, getting mixed messages.

00:36:44.406 --> 00:36:45.990
MATT: Okay.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.139
LAURA: From yourself, mostly.

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:50.014
You're the one that doesn't want to break it.

00:36:50.014 --> 00:36:51.554
MATT: So you begin casting.

00:36:51.554 --> 00:36:52.525
LIAM: Yeah.

00:36:52.525 --> 00:36:54.217
Yeah, currently I'm going to put it in, like,

00:36:54.217 --> 00:36:58.025
a little bit of a stone net, which should be easy to break,

00:36:58.025 --> 00:37:02.108
one of us to break it if we want, in a quick hit.

00:37:03.913 --> 00:37:05.134
MATT: Caduceus.

00:37:05.134 --> 00:37:06.344
As they're all focusing on this,

00:37:06.344 --> 00:37:08.442
you hear this very, very faint--

00:37:08.442 --> 00:37:09.289
MARISHA: Son-of-a-bitch.

00:37:09.289 --> 00:37:11.295
MATT: (soft approaching footsteps)

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:12.150
TALIESIN: Something's coming.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.332
MATT: (soft approaching footsteps)

00:37:13.332 --> 00:37:15.003
TALIESIN: Back up.

00:37:15.003 --> 00:37:16.655
LAURA: Against the wall, Invoke Duplicity.

00:37:16.655 --> 00:37:18.421
MARISHA: Yeah. (stammering) Guard.

00:37:18.421 --> 00:37:20.838
ASHLEY: I get in front of Caleb. So he can--
MARISHA: Patient Defense.

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:21.954
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: -- do his thing.

00:37:21.954 --> 00:37:24.355
MATT: As you're focusing, you guys begin to hear this, too,

00:37:24.355 --> 00:37:26.622
and as the chamber begins to echo,

00:37:26.622 --> 00:37:28.496
this impact is something like heavy footfalls

00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:30.620
making their way to your direction.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.565
You hear

00:37:31.565 --> 00:37:36.290
(scraping and thudding footsteps)

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.607
(scraping and thudding footsteps)

00:37:38.607 --> 00:37:40.808
And you begin to see light,

00:37:40.808 --> 00:37:43.760
like sparks lighting up an aspect of the hallway

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.900
from where you guys entered from, when you were all within

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.555
this cul-de-sac of an ended chamber.

00:37:48.555 --> 00:37:50.770
And you watch as through the opening,

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.110
as you all found your space to hide

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.510
within the interior, you are at the moment-- you're on

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.242
probably no more than 30 seconds into the spell before--

00:37:59.242 --> 00:38:00.233
LIAM: Yeah, have to bail on it.

00:38:00.233 --> 00:38:01.157
MATT: Yeah, you have to bail on it

00:38:01.157 --> 00:38:04.689
and try to move out of the way, as you watch this towering,

00:38:04.689 --> 00:38:08.803
15-foot tall automaton come charging through,

00:38:08.803 --> 00:38:10.716
(loud footsteps)

00:38:10.716 --> 00:38:12.645
Top of the stairs, you see it standing there.

00:38:12.645 --> 00:38:17.645
This massive armored centurion, if you will.

00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:21.691
This guardian golem-type entity stands there.

00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:25.363
Its head itself, this juggernaut-like,

00:38:25.363 --> 00:38:27.900
gradual hill to the shoulder. In the middle of its face,

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.285
you see this glowing, bright red gem

00:38:30.285 --> 00:38:33.533
that's scanning the room. You see its armored torso,

00:38:33.533 --> 00:38:35.326
its upper chest, reaching wide,

00:38:35.326 --> 00:38:37.810
and his one arm is a massive fist.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:42.022
The other one is this long lance that ends in a barb.

00:38:42.022 --> 00:38:43.470
As it stands there, you also see

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.713
that it's sustained heavy damage.

00:38:45.713 --> 00:38:48.747
Its body is somewhat cracked open, on the inside you can see

00:38:48.747 --> 00:38:49.672
these cables that are

00:38:49.672 --> 00:38:52.340
(electrical wire sparking) sparking.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.452
MARISHA: Recent damage?

00:38:54.452 --> 00:38:57.476
MATT: If you want to make a
perception check real fast on it.

00:38:57.476 --> 00:38:59.259
MARISHA: I do.

00:38:59.259 --> 00:39:01.624
Oh. Real bad, I think that's a six.

00:39:01.624 --> 00:39:02.525
LIAM: Oh boy.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:39:02.525 --> 00:39:05.997
MATT: Hard to tell, but nevertheless,

00:39:05.997 --> 00:39:07.834
let me pull the chamber out so you know what it looks like.

00:39:07.834 --> 00:39:10.577
(yelling)

00:39:10.577 --> 00:39:12.535
LAURA: This is why nervous, because we're all going to die.

00:39:12.535 --> 00:39:13.368
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:13.368 --> 00:39:16.018
SAM: This chamber's surprised by-- I mean--

00:39:16.018 --> 00:39:16.851
TRAVIS: Surprised by?

00:39:16.851 --> 00:39:18.833
SAM: Supported by Dwarven Forge.

00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:21.328
Surprise that special dungeon master in your life

00:39:21.328 --> 00:39:23.754
this holiday season with Dwarven Forge gaming terrain.

00:39:23.754 --> 00:39:26.798
Go check out their amazing stuff at dwarvenforge.com

00:39:26.798 --> 00:39:28.418
or right here.

00:39:28.418 --> 00:39:30.307
TRAVIS: Oh, snap.

00:39:30.307 --> 00:39:31.723
LAURA: Ooh!

00:39:33.378 --> 00:39:35.167
ASHLEY: Look at those globes.

00:39:35.167 --> 00:39:37.517
Those are big orbs.

00:39:37.517 --> 00:39:39.300
LAURA: They're way bigger than I envisioned.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.133
ASHLEY: Same, same.

00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:42.271
MATT: Where are you placed in this Chamber, everybody?

00:39:42.271 --> 00:39:43.279
LAURA: Oh god.

00:39:43.279 --> 00:39:46.004
SAM: I'm crouching behind the robit. Where's the robit?

00:39:46.004 --> 00:39:48.535
TRAVIS: I'm on the stairs to your left.

00:39:48.535 --> 00:39:53.510
MATT: This would be the rubble where the creature thing

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.526
automaton is.

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:56.396
There you go.

00:39:56.396 --> 00:39:57.617
So you're couching behind it over, here?

00:39:57.617 --> 00:39:58.867
SAM: Yep.
MATT: Okay.

00:39:58.867 --> 00:40:01.070
Everyone else?
TRAVIS: I was right here.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.103
TRAVIS: Top.
MATT: Fjord, you over here?

00:40:02.103 --> 00:40:02.936
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:40:02.936 --> 00:40:04.880
LIAM: Yasha and Caleb would have been near the center

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.095
of the room, and the moment we saw that thing,

00:40:07.095 --> 00:40:09.479
Caleb would have taken a step left, so he is directly

00:40:09.479 --> 00:40:12.000
behind Yasha, hiding from it.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.424
MATT: So right over here?

00:40:13.424 --> 00:40:14.547
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: No, I got it.

00:40:14.547 --> 00:40:15.411
MATT: And Yasha, you'd be about there?

00:40:15.411 --> 00:40:16.630
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.494
LAURA: I'm right here.

00:40:18.494 --> 00:40:19.792
Can you see where my thing is?

00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:22.683
TRAVIS: Did you paint symbols on the floor?

00:40:22.683 --> 00:40:23.724
ASHLEY: That looks amazing.

00:40:23.724 --> 00:40:25.339
LAURA: Can you see where my thingy is?
MATT: No, these are glowing.

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:26.647
SAM: No, he can't see that.
MARISHA: On the backside, ba--

00:40:26.647 --> 00:40:27.570
You can't see it.
MATT: Over here?

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.626
LAURA: On the other side. Yeah.
MATT: Gotcha.

00:40:29.626 --> 00:40:32.289
TALIESIN: And I'm doing the same thing on the other side.

00:40:32.289 --> 00:40:34.004
LAURA: And I invoked duplicity.

00:40:34.004 --> 00:40:36.009
MATT: Indeed, and where did you invoke it?

00:40:36.009 --> 00:40:38.908
LAURA: I invoked duplicity right next to

00:40:38.908 --> 00:40:42.193
the stairway in the middle. Yeah, right there.

00:40:42.193 --> 00:40:44.694
TRAVIS: The symbols are glowing on the floor, they pulse.

00:40:44.694 --> 00:40:45.904
SAM: No, they don't.

00:40:45.904 --> 00:40:49.045
TRAVIS: They are pulsing right now!
Look at that! Look, look.

00:40:49.045 --> 00:40:51.070
LAURA: What?! How?!
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.433
Tucked against the wall.

00:40:52.433 --> 00:40:53.684
MATT: There?
MARISHA: Yes, please.

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.853
LIAM: I've done the same thing with ladders in my home game.

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:57.961
I love the railings.

00:40:57.961 --> 00:40:59.165
Yes!

00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:02.505
TRAVIS: Matt, that is a little large.
LAURA: That's so cool.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.313
MARISHA: That's cool.

00:41:04.313 --> 00:41:06.419
SAM: We should have used the

00:41:06.419 --> 00:41:08.290
new Fjord figurine to be like--

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.869
(laughter)

00:41:10.869 --> 00:41:13.437
ASHLEY: Does he only have one one arm?

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:16.123
MATT: It has one massive fist and then--

00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:18.605
This mini isn't perfectly accurate to the vision.

00:41:18.605 --> 00:41:20.623
One arm is this long, pointed lance

00:41:20.623 --> 00:41:22.245
with a barb at the end.

00:41:22.245 --> 00:41:23.597
But--
MARISHA: Lance.

00:41:23.597 --> 00:41:25.123
MATT: It is very aware of your presence.

00:41:25.123 --> 00:41:26.353
LIAM: Shite.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:27.541
MATT: And I need you all to roll initiative.

00:41:27.541 --> 00:41:29.045
SAM: Oh, snap.
TRAVIS: Oh fuck,

00:41:29.045 --> 00:41:31.268
I just thought we'd have a little bit more time.

00:41:31.268 --> 00:41:32.559
MATT: Nope.
LIAM: No!

00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:33.885
TALIESIN: No.

00:41:33.885 --> 00:41:35.659
MATT: Oh, wow. Okay.
MARISHA: Is that good or bad?

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.953
LIAM: I hate going first and I rolled a 20.

00:41:37.953 --> 00:41:40.079
MARISHA: I hate going last and I rolled a one.

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:41.411
Can we tradesies?
LAURA: No!

00:41:41.411 --> 00:41:42.588
MARISHA: Can we just trade?

00:41:42.588 --> 00:41:44.054
TRAVIS: Is there a stock market for initiative?
SAM: In this scenario you want--

00:41:44.054 --> 00:41:45.711
MATT: Apparently. No.
SAM: -- to go first. Otherwise, he's gonna whack you.

00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:46.754
MARISHA: Damn it!
LAURA: Yeah.

00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:48.449
MATT: 25 to 20.

00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:49.311
LIAM: 22.

00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:51.917
MARISHA: I'm going roll my d8.
LAURA: 20.

00:41:51.917 --> 00:41:53.488
MARISHA: Oh my god. Are you serious?

00:41:53.488 --> 00:41:55.738
ASHLEY: They're glowing.

00:41:55.738 --> 00:41:58.664
MATT: All right. 20 to 15.

00:41:58.664 --> 00:41:59.697
SAM: 15.

00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:02.940
TRAVIS: Okay. This is not (laughs) a surprise.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.093
MARISHA: Wait, who is-- oh, wait.

00:42:05.093 --> 00:42:06.378
TRAVIS: Caleb, Jester, Nott.

00:42:06.378 --> 00:42:07.590
MARISHA: Caleb.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.045
MATT: 15 to 10.

00:42:09.045 --> 00:42:09.879
ASHLEY: 13.

00:42:09.879 --> 00:42:11.504
TRAVIS: 10.
MATT: All right.

00:42:15.518 --> 00:42:17.142
All righty. 10 to five?

00:42:17.142 --> 00:42:18.836
MARISHA: Seven.

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:19.705
TALIESIN: Seven.

00:42:19.705 --> 00:42:20.673
TRAVIS: Okay.
SAM: Shit.

00:42:20.673 --> 00:42:21.952
TRAVIS: Who has the higher dex between you two?

00:42:21.952 --> 00:42:24.077
MARISHA: Me.
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a dumb question.

00:42:24.077 --> 00:42:26.868
(laughter)

00:42:26.868 --> 00:42:28.229
MATT: All righty.
SAM: He's made of electricity.

00:42:28.229 --> 00:42:29.390
He's probably impervious to--

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.418
MATT: Top of the round, as it stands there, looming over.

00:42:32.418 --> 00:42:33.947
The burning red gem

00:42:33.947 --> 00:42:35.092
in the middle of the face,

00:42:35.092 --> 00:42:36.961
giving this light that

00:42:36.961 --> 00:42:38.597
scans across the chamber at once.

00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:40.225
Its shoulder sparks once

00:42:40.225 --> 00:42:42.073
and its body jostles to one side

00:42:42.073 --> 00:42:44.781
before it rights itself.

00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:46.405
Caleb, you're up first. What are you doing?

00:42:46.405 --> 00:42:48.820
LIAM: I lean out from behind Yasha

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.347
and take the cat mint

00:42:50.347 --> 00:42:52.314
from inside my coat and go (foomph)

00:42:52.314 --> 00:42:55.086
and a spectral Frumpkin floats

00:42:55.086 --> 00:42:58.848
and the Cat's Ire claw is right above that

00:42:58.848 --> 00:42:59.920
glowing circle.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.574
TRAVIS: It's a big sword.

00:43:01.574 --> 00:43:05.682
LIAM: And I will use it to shred

00:43:07.482 --> 00:43:09.899
and hit the automaton.

00:43:09.899 --> 00:43:10.970
MATT: All righty.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.763
TRAVIS: We're going after it. We're getting it.

00:43:13.763 --> 00:43:18.325
MATT: As it rushes over to meet it to strike.

00:43:18.325 --> 00:43:20.198
LIAM: Make a melee spell attack, okay.

00:43:20.198 --> 00:43:21.031
MATT: Indeed.

00:43:22.765 --> 00:43:25.093
LIAM: Oh, that hits. That's a 26.

00:43:25.093 --> 00:43:26.353
MATT: That definitely hits.

00:43:26.353 --> 00:43:27.953
LIAM: And it is 4d8.

00:43:28.853 --> 00:43:31.296
TRAVIS: Does an automaton count as a creature?

00:43:31.296 --> 00:43:33.134
MATT: I mean, it counts as a creature.

00:43:33.134 --> 00:43:35.017
It's just its type is a construct.

00:43:35.017 --> 00:43:36.618
LIAM: 25 of slashing damage.

00:43:36.618 --> 00:43:38.535
MATT: Nice.
LIAM: With the claw.

00:43:39.728 --> 00:43:44.043
And I will back up to the opposite wall from it.

00:43:44.043 --> 00:43:45.252
MATT: Over here?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:43:45.252 --> 00:43:46.432
MATT: All righty.

00:43:46.432 --> 00:43:48.510
So as you're now up against the wall, concentrating,

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.910
you see this giant apparated arcane cat claw rushes up

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.797
and strikes across the front.

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:56.690
The claws spark and carve across the front of it.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.585
You see the giant gash marks where it managed to fit

00:43:59.585 --> 00:44:02.911
through its armor and leave this visible wound.

00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:04.847
The metal giving way ever so slightly,

00:44:04.847 --> 00:44:06.903
but still holding strong.

00:44:06.903 --> 00:44:07.736
That finishes--

00:44:07.736 --> 00:44:09.193
LIAM: With a slightly shell-shocked face,

00:44:09.193 --> 00:44:11.426
I just go: Hey, go, Yasha.

00:44:11.426 --> 00:44:14.138
MATT: (laughs)

00:44:14.138 --> 00:44:16.519
All righty. Jester, you're up next.

00:44:16.519 --> 00:44:19.309
LAURA: I'm going to have my duplicate

00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:21.243
run up a couple of the steps,

00:44:23.523 --> 00:44:27.598
and say, because she can talk now, she's going to say:

00:44:29.789 --> 00:44:31.651
It's me you want!

00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:32.709
(laughter)

00:44:32.709 --> 00:44:33.920
LAURA: I don't know.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.604
And I'm going to have her cast Banishment.

00:44:37.604 --> 00:44:38.509
MATT: On the creature?

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.342
LAURA: Yeah, at the creature.
SAM: Dang.

00:44:39.342 --> 00:44:41.300
MATT: Okay. All right.
MARISHA: Get it, get it queen.

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.801
MATT: What's the DC on it?

00:44:42.801 --> 00:44:43.952
LAURA: 18, charisma.

00:44:43.952 --> 00:44:46.179
MATT: 18 charisma. Nice.

00:44:46.179 --> 00:44:49.004
LIAM: That's a very handsome robot.

00:44:52.057 --> 00:44:54.840
TALIESIN: I know that look.
TRAVIS: Say it. Say it.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.317
MATT: I legitimately rolled a 19 and a 20,

00:44:58.317 --> 00:45:02.047
for reasons. It still fails.

00:45:02.047 --> 00:45:03.147
SAM: Oh, wow.

00:45:03.147 --> 00:45:06.499
LAURA: It might have a low charisma.

00:45:06.499 --> 00:45:07.860
MATT: All righty. So--

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.513
TALIESIN: Nobody likes you.

00:45:09.513 --> 00:45:11.136
(laughter)

00:45:11.136 --> 00:45:13.925
MATT: It vanishes from the space here for a moment.

00:45:13.925 --> 00:45:15.266
MARISHA: Oh my god.
SAM: A 20 isn't

00:45:15.266 --> 00:45:17.597
an automatic success for?

00:45:17.597 --> 00:45:19.659
TRAVIS: Like a dirt-- oh.

00:45:19.659 --> 00:45:21.633
SAM: No, I guess not.

00:45:21.633 --> 00:45:22.696
Wow, cool.

00:45:22.696 --> 00:45:24.307
TRAVIS: With disadvantage?

00:45:24.307 --> 00:45:26.019
MARISHA: How long has it gone for?

00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:27.235
A minute?
LAURA: A minute.

00:45:27.235 --> 00:45:29.346
TRAVIS: Did you roll at disadvantage?

00:45:29.346 --> 00:45:30.179
SAM: At advantage.

00:45:30.179 --> 00:45:31.601
LAURA: Advantage.

00:45:31.601 --> 00:45:34.079
TRAVIS: 20
LAURA: He had advantage.

00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:37.568
SAM: So he's got a negative three charisma.

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:38.401
LAURA: At least.

00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:39.780
TRAVIS: At least.
SAM: Yeah.

00:45:42.625 --> 00:45:44.958
MATT: Yeah. I mean, just like skills.

00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:47.825
It's not like there's a critical success on a save.

00:45:47.825 --> 00:45:48.658
LAURA: Okay.

00:45:48.658 --> 00:45:50.622
MATT: Just wanted to double-check just to be safe, so.

00:45:50.622 --> 00:45:52.872
All right. Double-checking.

00:45:55.407 --> 00:45:56.901
TALIESIN: Just gives us a time limit, is all, really.

00:45:56.901 --> 00:45:59.014
LAURA: Yeah. We have a minute until he comes back.

00:45:59.014 --> 00:46:00.452
SAM: We can prepare.

00:46:00.452 --> 00:46:02.099
TALIESIN: Or we can get and run.

00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:03.110
MARISHA: Okay.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.159
SAM: We're going to get that thing in a minute?

00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:07.823
MARISHA: We can't. It takes him
10 minutes to cast his spell.

00:46:07.823 --> 00:46:09.773
LAURA: Yeah, we're not going to--
TALIESIN: Just try and cut it the hell out.

00:46:09.773 --> 00:46:11.631
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Well, I've got the claw.

00:46:11.631 --> 00:46:13.270
I could try to smash the shit out of it instead.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.401
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: It's not a bad idea.

00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:17.730
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I could go to the roof, right? Or, well.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.558
MARISHA: I have a deep feeling I can't stun this thing.

00:46:20.558 --> 00:46:22.742
LAURA: Probably not, but we have a minute.

00:46:22.742 --> 00:46:23.875
He's going to come back in a minute.

00:46:23.875 --> 00:46:25.883
So we should prepare to attack him when he comes back

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:26.791
in this spot, regardless.

00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:28.279
MATT: Well, 30 seconds now.

00:46:28.279 --> 00:46:29.112
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:46:29.112 --> 00:46:30.325
Get it. Let's go. Let's go.
MARISHA: Do the claw. Get the claw.

00:46:30.325 --> 00:46:31.158
LAURA: You guys do your thing.

00:46:31.158 --> 00:46:33.656
I'm going to stand there and get ready to cast--

00:46:33.656 --> 00:46:37.272
SAM: Fuck. Do you want me to lift up Yasha

00:46:37.272 --> 00:46:39.482
so she can start whacking at it?
LIAM: I'll start swiping with the claw, see what happens.

00:46:39.482 --> 00:46:41.458
ASHLEY: If you want to, I can try to help.
MATT: Swiping with the?

00:46:41.458 --> 00:46:43.903
LIAM: Cat's claw. Striking the gem in the roof.

00:46:43.903 --> 00:46:45.036
MATT: Oh, okay.
LIAM: In the ceiling.

00:46:45.036 --> 00:46:47.758
SAM: I will levitate Yasha,

00:46:47.758 --> 00:46:51.502
so she can also strike at the roof of the gem.

00:46:51.502 --> 00:46:52.912
ASHLEY: Great.
MATT: Okay.

00:46:52.912 --> 00:46:57.412
MARISHA: I'll move and get in place
opposite of Jester clone.

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.139
MATT: Okay, right there?
MARISHA: Yes.

00:47:00.139 --> 00:47:00.972
MATT: You've got it.

00:47:00.972 --> 00:47:04.798
MARISHA: And wait and take the dodge action and just wait.

00:47:04.798 --> 00:47:06.617
MATT: Okay, you're just waiting for it to arrive?

00:47:06.617 --> 00:47:08.027
Okay, Yasha, you're now hovering

00:47:08.027 --> 00:47:10.700
up with the claw towards the top.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.358
MARISHA: Or I guess just hold my action.

00:47:12.358 --> 00:47:13.649
MATT: All righty.
ASHLEY: Hell yeah.

00:47:13.649 --> 00:47:16.187
MATT: So you begin slowly drifting up there.

00:47:16.187 --> 00:47:17.568
What are you doing--
TRAVIS: On the--

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:19.962
MATT: What are you doing to prepare as you drift upward?

00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:22.320
ASHLEY: I'm pulling out Magician's Judge

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.390
and I'm getting ready to

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.730
try to help with the claw and go to town on it.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:27.967
MATT: You've got it. What are you doing, Fjord?

00:47:27.967 --> 00:47:29.863
TRAVIS: I'm going to run backside
to where he disappeared from.

00:47:29.863 --> 00:47:32.096
So we form a little triangle between the duplicate

00:47:32.096 --> 00:47:33.012
and Beau.
MATT: Here, you mean?

00:47:33.012 --> 00:47:34.655
TRAVIS: Yeah. Maybe a little more to your right?

00:47:34.655 --> 00:47:36.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah, perfect.
MATT: Like, right up against it?

00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:38.464
TRAVIS: Yeah, so when he appears, I'm behind him

00:47:38.464 --> 00:47:41.124
in a triangle between the duplicate Jester and Beau.

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:42.876
MATT: Okay. Right there?
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:47:42.876 --> 00:47:46.333
LAURA: I'm going to cast Stone Shape,

00:47:46.333 --> 00:47:48.801
and I'm going to cast it on the ground where

00:47:48.801 --> 00:47:52.371
one of his feet were, and I'm going to create a large hole.

00:47:52.371 --> 00:47:54.536
So when he bamfs back in, he topples.

00:47:54.536 --> 00:47:55.444
MARISHA: That's a great idea.

00:47:55.444 --> 00:47:56.419
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: A little bit.

00:47:56.419 --> 00:47:57.427
MATT: You've got it.

00:47:57.427 --> 00:47:58.552
MARISHA: I'll hold my attack.

00:47:58.552 --> 00:48:01.992
I said dodge, but I'm holding my attack.
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up to Beau.

00:48:01.992 --> 00:48:03.182
TRAVIS: Holding my attack.

00:48:03.182 --> 00:48:04.192
TALIESIN: Tap you.

00:48:04.192 --> 00:48:05.433
MARISHA: Tap me.

00:48:05.433 --> 00:48:06.628
SAM: Tap that Beau.

00:48:06.628 --> 00:48:08.560
MARISHA: Tap that Beau.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.401
TALIESIN: And I'm going to give you--

00:48:11.372 --> 00:48:13.629
Is this a "fuck it" moment?

00:48:13.629 --> 00:48:14.462
LIAM: Yes.

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:16.420
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.681
TALIESIN: You know, I'm going to hold off on the--

00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:20.073
big spell or no big spell?
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:48:20.073 --> 00:48:22.224
TALIESIN: I'm going to just give you Freedom of Movement.

00:48:22.224 --> 00:48:24.458
MARISHA: Okay.

00:48:24.458 --> 00:48:28.975
Can't be grappled and other stuff.

00:48:28.975 --> 00:48:30.371
TALIESIN: No difficult terrain.

00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:31.991
MARISHA: No difficult terrain.
SAM: Probably nothing.

00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:34.942
TALIESIN: Target speed.
Yeah, you can't be paralyzed or restrained.

00:48:34.942 --> 00:48:36.058
MARISHA: Okay.

00:48:36.058 --> 00:48:37.065
TALIESIN: And you can spend five feet

00:48:37.065 --> 00:48:38.523
of movement to automatically escape

00:48:38.523 --> 00:48:40.223
from non-magical restraints such as manacles,

00:48:40.223 --> 00:48:41.916
creatures that have you grappled.

00:48:41.916 --> 00:48:42.855
MARISHA: Can't-- okay.

00:48:42.855 --> 00:48:44.491
MATT: There's a whole floor element
that goes up to the wall.

00:48:44.491 --> 00:48:46.141
MARISHA: Thank you. That's great.
MATT: And the ceiling where the gem is.

00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:47.952
MARISHA: If he grabs me.

00:48:47.952 --> 00:48:49.242
TRAVIS: That's so cool.

00:48:49.242 --> 00:48:50.728
TALIESIN: For an hour.
TRAVIS: How are they glowing?

00:48:50.728 --> 00:48:51.660
LAURA: Cute, though.

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:53.403
MARISHA: What's it called again?

00:48:53.403 --> 00:48:56.166
TALIESIN: Also, if this creature went through my guardian,

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.341
it would have taken some damage, so.

00:48:58.341 --> 00:48:59.584
MATT: The guardian was set up at--

00:48:59.584 --> 00:49:01.162
TALIESIN: At the base, at the entrance of the tunnel.

00:49:01.162 --> 00:49:02.984
MATT: Correct. And it did not--

00:49:02.984 --> 00:49:04.130
TALIESIN: Cool. Just checking.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.096
TRAVIS: It ignores walls (laughs).

00:49:06.096 --> 00:49:07.129
SAM: Matthew?
MATT: Yes.

00:49:07.129 --> 00:49:08.207
SAM: While we're waiting our 30 seconds,

00:49:08.207 --> 00:49:11.173
I'm going to move up to the orb closest to me

00:49:11.173 --> 00:49:13.351
and hide behind it.
MATT: You've got it. You are now--

00:49:13.351 --> 00:49:16.861
SAM: And take out my Corecut Dagger!

00:49:16.861 --> 00:49:17.863
MATT: You got it.

00:49:17.863 --> 00:49:19.372
(laughter)

00:49:19.372 --> 00:49:21.364
SAM: Corecut Dagger!
MATT: All righty.

00:49:21.364 --> 00:49:22.938
SAM: Get ready and hold my attack.

00:49:22.938 --> 00:49:24.212
TRAVIS and SAM: Corecut Dagger.

00:49:24.212 --> 00:49:25.938
MATT: So Caduceus, are you doing anything position-wise,

00:49:25.938 --> 00:49:28.340
or are you staying put?

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.647
TALIESIN: I think I'm going, uh--

00:49:30.647 --> 00:49:31.905
LAURA: Can you give us blessings,

00:49:31.905 --> 00:49:34.355
or buff us or something?
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can, actually.

00:49:34.355 --> 00:49:38.242
I'm going to run over to, since it's only

00:49:38.242 --> 00:49:40.605
six seconds to do this, I'm going to run over to where

00:49:40.605 --> 00:49:44.239
I can get the most of them within 30 feet of me.

00:49:44.239 --> 00:49:47.693
And everyone's too spread out.

00:49:47.693 --> 00:49:50.213
MATT: From there, you could probably get

00:49:50.213 --> 00:49:53.571
most everybody except for Nott and Caleb and Yasha.

00:49:53.571 --> 00:49:55.208
TALIESIN: How many-- okay, how many people is that?

00:49:55.208 --> 00:49:56.756
MATT: That would be five, including yourself.

00:49:56.756 --> 00:49:57.964
TRAVIS: Where are you, physically?

00:49:57.964 --> 00:50:00.671
MATT: Sorry, four, because
Jester's duplicate is not a target.

00:50:00.671 --> 00:50:01.504
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:50:01.504 --> 00:50:02.960
MATT: So four, including yourself.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.201
SAM: But Jester's over there.

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.121
LAURA: Yeah.

00:50:05.121 --> 00:50:05.954
SAM: You just can't see her, Matt.

00:50:05.954 --> 00:50:08.337
MATT: No, I realize that,
but I'd counted five because of her figure.

00:50:08.337 --> 00:50:09.801
SAM: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:09.801 --> 00:50:13.166
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to cast Bless on

00:50:13.166 --> 00:50:15.711
everybody who's currently in range, including myself.

00:50:15.711 --> 00:50:17.381
MATT: Jester.

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:19.209
Caduceus.

00:50:19.209 --> 00:50:20.859
Fjord.
TRAVIS: d4.

00:50:20.859 --> 00:50:22.309
MATT: And Beauregard.

00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:23.150
TRAVIS: Or advantage?

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.191
TALIESIN: d4 to--

00:50:24.191 --> 00:50:25.608
MATT: Attacks.
TALIESIN: Attacks and saves.

00:50:25.608 --> 00:50:26.949
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Thanks.

00:50:26.949 --> 00:50:30.532
MATT: All righty.
LAURA: And I am going to prepare--

00:50:32.881 --> 00:50:34.353
Oof.

00:50:34.353 --> 00:50:35.368
MATT: Are you heading back to where you were,

00:50:35.368 --> 00:50:36.763
or are you staying put or moving?

00:50:36.763 --> 00:50:38.772
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

00:50:38.772 --> 00:50:40.482
MATT: You've got, like, two more rounds--

00:50:40.482 --> 00:50:43.591
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: -- before this comes back.

00:50:43.591 --> 00:50:45.136
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm going to head back to where I was.

00:50:45.136 --> 00:50:45.969
MATT: Okay.

00:50:45.969 --> 00:50:48.724
LAURA: I'm going to prepare Guiding Bolt at 4th-level

00:50:48.724 --> 00:50:51.143
for the minute he's here again.

00:50:51.143 --> 00:50:52.866
MATT: You've got it.

00:50:52.866 --> 00:50:54.799
Well, okay,

00:50:54.799 --> 00:50:56.957
preparing a spell is concentrating on it

00:50:56.957 --> 00:50:59.325
and that will end your concentration on--

00:50:59.325 --> 00:51:00.491
LAURA: My duplicate?
MATT: Your duplicate.

00:51:00.491 --> 00:51:01.490
LAURA: Okay. Well, then I--
MATT: No, sorry.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:04.152
Your duplicate is gone, because when you cast Banishment,

00:51:04.152 --> 00:51:05.677
you have to concentrate on Banishment

00:51:05.677 --> 00:51:07.896
to keep them away.

00:51:07.896 --> 00:51:08.820
LAURA: Ah, okay,

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.875
then I guess I myself ran over to do the Stone Shape

00:51:11.875 --> 00:51:13.598
that I talked about.

00:51:13.598 --> 00:51:15.435
MATT: Fair enough. Yep.

00:51:15.435 --> 00:51:16.268
LAURA: So yeah.
MATT: And there is a pit

00:51:16.268 --> 00:51:18.143
in the ground about five feet deep.

00:51:18.143 --> 00:51:20.276
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:51:21.227 --> 00:51:23.202
MATT: Okay?
TALIESIN: Any luck getting the crystal out?

00:51:23.202 --> 00:51:24.408
LIAM: Well, yeah, so I would say,

00:51:24.408 --> 00:51:26.751
in all that helter skelter action, I would,

00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:30.431
at least one time, try to use the claw to just go and pull.

00:51:30.431 --> 00:51:32.079
And if that doesn't work, take a slash.

00:51:32.079 --> 00:51:34.538
MATT: You got it. So go ahead and make a--

00:51:34.538 --> 00:51:36.131
is there a strength score?
LIAM: It's 26.

00:51:36.131 --> 00:51:38.156
MATT: 26. All right. So go ahead and roll a d20.

00:51:38.156 --> 00:51:39.851
LIAM: Plus eight.
MATT: And add plus eight to it.

00:51:39.851 --> 00:51:41.482
MARISHA: Come on, kitty cat.

00:51:41.482 --> 00:51:44.325
(groaning)

00:51:44.325 --> 00:51:46.462
MATT: The claw digs in and tries to pull,

00:51:46.462 --> 00:51:47.460
but that first round,

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.401
it's just not quite getting the resistance you want for it.

00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:51.345
It's stuck in there.
SAM: It doesn't have a thumb.

00:51:51.345 --> 00:51:53.491
That's the problem.
MATT: Yasha, what are you trying?

00:51:53.491 --> 00:51:57.456
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to try to wedge the--.

00:51:57.456 --> 00:51:58.289
MARISHA: Make biscuits?

00:51:58.289 --> 00:52:02.889
ASHLEY: Trying to get it in there and try to pop it out as--

00:52:02.889 --> 00:52:04.148
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.368
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check for me.

00:52:08.368 --> 00:52:10.484
So just roll a d20, and add your strength modifier.

00:52:10.484 --> 00:52:11.317
SAM: Jam it.

00:52:11.317 --> 00:52:13.325
ASHLEY: I wonder if I should just try to break it.

00:52:13.325 --> 00:52:16.551
Just start hacking at it instead.

00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:19.218
I'll try to get it out of there.

00:52:22.215 --> 00:52:23.048
Okay.

00:52:24.156 --> 00:52:25.556
15.
MATT: 15.

00:52:25.556 --> 00:52:28.379
You find there's a slight gap in there,

00:52:28.379 --> 00:52:31.241
probably from the impact and slightly jostled by the pull

00:52:31.241 --> 00:52:34.723
of the claw, but it's not enough to start getting it out.

00:52:34.723 --> 00:52:35.979
But you do find there is a bit

00:52:35.979 --> 00:52:38.488
of an area where you can find the blade,

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:39.528
get some purchase in there.

00:52:39.528 --> 00:52:40.922
And you're like, there might be a way to do this,

00:52:40.922 --> 00:52:42.718
with enough time and enough strength.

00:52:42.718 --> 00:52:43.551
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:52:43.551 --> 00:52:46.194
MATT: But that's your turn there. Everyone else is prepping.

00:52:46.194 --> 00:52:47.617
We'll do your guys' rounds a couple more times here

00:52:47.617 --> 00:52:50.655
because you guys are catching up
with what they've all been preparing for.

00:52:50.655 --> 00:52:51.563
So do you want to make another check?

00:52:51.563 --> 00:52:52.918
LIAM: I'm going to try to pull it again.

00:52:52.918 --> 00:52:54.179
MATT: Okay.

00:52:54.179 --> 00:52:55.596
LIAM: Not roll a one this time. That's better.

00:52:55.596 --> 00:52:56.842
24.

00:52:56.842 --> 00:52:58.708
MATT: 24.

00:52:58.708 --> 00:53:01.002
It's beginning to pull a little bit free,

00:53:01.002 --> 00:53:03.327
but it's--
LIAM: Look a lot like Christmas?

00:53:03.327 --> 00:53:05.037
(laughter)

00:53:05.037 --> 00:53:07.142
MATT: It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

00:53:07.142 --> 00:53:08.222
LIAM: Okay.

00:53:08.222 --> 00:53:10.497
MATT: So there you go. But it's still holding fast.

00:53:10.497 --> 00:53:11.881
LIAM: Okay.
ASHLEY: Go again.

00:53:11.881 --> 00:53:13.213
LIAM: Get it, get it, girl.

00:53:13.213 --> 00:53:14.745
LAURA: Get it, get it, girl.
SAM: Fry it.

00:53:14.745 --> 00:53:16.229
ASHLEY: Get it, girl. Get it, get it.

00:53:16.229 --> 00:53:17.834
It's cocked.

00:53:17.834 --> 00:53:20.973
SAM: Don't you have an advantage
because you're, like, awesome?

00:53:20.973 --> 00:53:21.831
ASHLEY: No.

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:23.280
MATT: If she's raging, she would, but.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.648
LAURA: Rage! Why aren't you raging?

00:53:24.648 --> 00:53:28.326
ASHLEY: Wait, are we on our, yeah.

00:53:28.326 --> 00:53:29.184
SAM: (pigeon coo)

00:53:29.184 --> 00:53:30.830
MATT: It would just use one of your rages for the day

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:31.887
if you were to do it, so.

00:53:31.887 --> 00:53:33.360
TRAVIS: Just remember it'll drop afterwards

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.594
because you're not hitting anyone or being hit.
LAURA: Right, right, right.

00:53:35.594 --> 00:53:36.427
MATT and ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:53:38.202 --> 00:53:39.901
ASHLEY: I would like to rage.
TRAVIS: Yeah, you would!

00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:40.926
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (roar)

00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:42.478
MATT: All right. So you use another rage.

00:53:42.478 --> 00:53:44.480
You do get advantage on your ability check.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.313
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:53:45.313 --> 00:53:46.647
LIAM: Maybe because she knows she has a date coming up.

00:53:46.647 --> 00:53:47.713
ASHLEY: Yeah, that one's better.

00:53:47.713 --> 00:53:48.771
Okay.

00:53:48.771 --> 00:53:52.387
So that would be a total of

00:53:53.995 --> 00:53:54.906
23.

00:53:54.906 --> 00:53:55.739
MATT: 23.

00:53:56.746 --> 00:53:58.532
Both of you are pulling at this

00:53:58.532 --> 00:54:01.238
and it's starting to feel like it's getting closer

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:04.025
to coming free, but neither of you
are able to close that gap.

00:54:04.025 --> 00:54:06.590
It's pretty tight in there.
MARISHA: We can buy time. Keep at it.

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:08.005
MATT: This is the last round for both of you--

00:54:08.005 --> 00:54:12.064
MARISHA: Come on! Come on, kitty cat!
MATT: -- before the creature returns.

00:54:12.064 --> 00:54:13.825
LIAM: Not as good.

00:54:13.825 --> 00:54:16.421
15 on that one.
LAURA: The orbs, I bet were.

00:54:16.421 --> 00:54:18.444
MATT: 15.
LIAM: Finish it.

00:54:18.444 --> 00:54:19.452
Finish it!

00:54:19.452 --> 00:54:20.964
ASHLEY: Here we go.

00:54:20.964 --> 00:54:21.797
Cocked.

00:54:21.797 --> 00:54:23.206
MARISHA: Release him from his cage.

00:54:23.206 --> 00:54:24.940
ASHLEY: (groans) Oh, but advantage!

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.857
MATT: Are you raging again?

00:54:28.048 --> 00:54:29.220
It's using another rage, if you're going to do it.

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.685
TALIESIN: Have enough rages to keep up, or?

00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:33.232
ASHLEY: Let me see.

00:54:33.232 --> 00:54:34.874
I have three more.

00:54:34.874 --> 00:54:36.088
LAURA: Yeah, do it!
LIAM: Oh, gosh.

00:54:36.088 --> 00:54:37.248
SAM: Tons!
ASHLEY: I'll take it.

00:54:37.248 --> 00:54:39.056
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Tons of rage.

00:54:40.291 --> 00:54:41.319
LIAM: It's 2020, after all.

00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:42.902
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:54:44.258 --> 00:54:45.299
18.

00:54:45.299 --> 00:54:46.724
MATT: 18.
ASHLEY: Damn it!

00:54:46.724 --> 00:54:48.686
MATT: You're both trying and you're not quite getting free.

00:54:48.686 --> 00:54:52.866
It's very heavily wedged in there, and at this moment--

00:54:52.866 --> 00:54:54.656
LAURA: Fuck.
ASHLEY: Shit.

00:54:54.656 --> 00:54:56.921
MATT: There's a flash of light

00:54:56.921 --> 00:54:58.574
and the creature appears where it was,

00:54:58.574 --> 00:55:02.371
and then sinks in and then falls to one side.

00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:04.166
You can see it's technically prone at the moment.

00:55:04.166 --> 00:55:05.591
MARISHA and LAURA: Yes!

00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:06.805
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:55:06.805 --> 00:55:08.386
MATT: As it is now within a five--

00:55:08.386 --> 00:55:11.062
It is 15 feet tall, so the five-foot drop is just enough

00:55:11.062 --> 00:55:14.743
to make it a little inconvenienced.

00:55:14.743 --> 00:55:16.583
But since it does drop at the end of your turn,

00:55:16.583 --> 00:55:19.543
we're back in the initiative order here.

00:55:19.543 --> 00:55:22.063
It was after you, so it takes its turn.

00:55:22.063 --> 00:55:23.433
LIAM: Dalek!

00:55:23.433 --> 00:55:24.856
MATT: Stands back up.

00:55:24.856 --> 00:55:26.419
MARISHA: Exterminate.

00:55:26.419 --> 00:55:27.415
LAURA: Nobody prepped anything?

00:55:27.415 --> 00:55:29.265
Nobody was prepping to attack it the minute it appeared

00:55:29.265 --> 00:55:30.098
or anything?
MATT: You were.

00:55:30.098 --> 00:55:30.931
MARISHA: We all were.

00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:32.389
MATT: Well, no, you are holding onto the--

00:55:32.389 --> 00:55:33.737
sorry, you were holding onto your--

00:55:33.737 --> 00:55:34.691
LAURA: Banishment, but they were both--

00:55:34.691 --> 00:55:36.425
MATT: You were and you were, you're both holding onto stuff.

00:55:36.425 --> 00:55:37.423
SAM: I've got my dagger up.

00:55:37.423 --> 00:55:38.423
MATT: Yep. So go for it.

00:55:38.423 --> 00:55:40.627
Those who are holding actions, take them now.

00:55:40.627 --> 00:55:42.085
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: Berergerd and Verth.

00:55:42.085 --> 00:55:44.343
SAM: But as he appears, he's prone, right?

00:55:44.343 --> 00:55:45.782
MATT: As he appears, he's prone, correct.

00:55:45.782 --> 00:55:47.695
So your attacks would have an advantage on him.

00:55:47.695 --> 00:55:51.986
SAM: Except mine would have disadvantage?

00:55:51.986 --> 00:55:54.503
MATT: Technically, because it's ranged, yeah.
LAURA: Sorry, buddy.

00:55:54.503 --> 00:55:55.731
MARISHA: Ours have advantage?

00:55:55.731 --> 00:55:57.703
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Pop, pop.

00:55:57.703 --> 00:55:58.754
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:55:58.754 --> 00:55:59.862
(cheering)

00:55:59.862 --> 00:56:01.059
MATT: Nice!

00:56:01.059 --> 00:56:02.058
TRAVIS: It was because of that advantage.

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:03.400
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead.

00:56:04.742 --> 00:56:09.066
MARISHA: Okay, that first one is a dirty 30.

00:56:09.066 --> 00:56:10.614
MATT: That'll hit.

00:56:10.614 --> 00:56:12.655
MARISHA: The second one-- oh my goodness,

00:56:12.655 --> 00:56:15.813
I rolled two fours.

00:56:15.813 --> 00:56:17.109
16.
MATT: Misses.

00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:18.791
MARISHA: Okay.
TALIESIN: You also get the d4.

00:56:18.791 --> 00:56:20.248
MARISHA: (gasps) But I get a d4?

00:56:20.248 --> 00:56:21.277
MATT: You do, from Bless.

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:23.119
MARISHA: Come on.
TRAVIS: Do I want to Divine Smite?

00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:26.335
MARISHA: Give me, yes! A four, so 20 total.

00:56:26.335 --> 00:56:27.302
MATT: 20? Misses.

00:56:27.302 --> 00:56:28.423
SAM: Ooh!

00:56:28.423 --> 00:56:30.713
MARISHA: Even though he's prone? Well, yeah.

00:56:30.713 --> 00:56:31.679
MATT: Yeah. That gave you the advantage,

00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:33.504
but he's still heavy armor.
ASHLEY: 24 misses?!

00:56:33.504 --> 00:56:34.476
MARISHA: 20 misses.

00:56:34.476 --> 00:56:35.309
ASHLEY: 20 misses.
LIAM: Thick metal armor.

00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:36.573
MATT: Heavily armored figure.

00:56:36.573 --> 00:56:37.873
MARISHA: Okay. But the first one hits?

00:56:37.873 --> 00:56:39.018
MATT: The first one hits. The second one,

00:56:39.018 --> 00:56:40.321
you actually go to strike

00:56:40.321 --> 00:56:43.441
and part of its open, wounded chest area sparks,

00:56:43.441 --> 00:56:45.449
and you recoil from it.

00:56:45.449 --> 00:56:48.702
But so you take your attack. Take your attack.

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.121
MARISHA: Okay. 10 damage for me.

00:56:51.121 --> 00:56:52.947
MATT: 10 damage from you, all righty.

00:56:55.847 --> 00:56:57.865
TRAVIS: 20. I don't think I'm going to--

00:56:57.865 --> 00:56:59.410
LAURA: No, do it!

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:00.260
TRAVIS: Really?

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.459
SAM: Do it!

00:57:01.459 --> 00:57:02.369
TRAVIS: All right.

00:57:02.369 --> 00:57:06.891
I'll pump a 5th-level Divine Smite into it.

00:57:06.891 --> 00:57:08.493
MATT: All righty.

00:57:08.493 --> 00:57:11.359
TALIESIN: Going for it, apparently.

00:57:11.359 --> 00:57:14.124
SAM: Matthew, I have a feat called Sharpshooter,

00:57:14.124 --> 00:57:17.615
and it says it ignores half cover and three quarters cover.

00:57:17.615 --> 00:57:18.856
Is that what prone is or no?

00:57:18.856 --> 00:57:20.022
MATT: No, no.
SAM: Prone is different. Cool.

00:57:20.022 --> 00:57:22.023
Disadvantage, then.

00:57:24.379 --> 00:57:25.992
TALIESIN: You don't have a d4, do you?

00:57:25.992 --> 00:57:26.825
MARISHA: I think--

00:57:26.825 --> 00:57:28.231
MATT: But you were hidden from it,

00:57:28.231 --> 00:57:29.959
technically, when it arrived.
SAM: I was.

00:57:29.959 --> 00:57:32.183
MATT: So you would have advantage,
which would cancel it out.

00:57:32.183 --> 00:57:33.248
So it'd be just a straight roll.

00:57:33.248 --> 00:57:35.230
SAM: Okay. I will re-roll.
MATT: Just roll.

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:36.650
MARISHA: I think Veth was in the--

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:37.895
SAM: 22.

00:57:37.895 --> 00:57:39.824
LAURA: Wait, did you add a d4?
MATT: 22?

00:57:39.824 --> 00:57:40.740
SAM: I'm not blessed.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.658
MATT: Not blessed. 22 misses.

00:57:42.658 --> 00:57:43.738
(groaning)

00:57:43.738 --> 00:57:45.840
LAURA and MARISHA: Whoa!

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.025
MATT: You throw the blade and watch as it--

00:57:47.025 --> 00:57:48.291
MARISHA: Oh boy!

00:57:48.291 --> 00:57:50.557
MATT: -- just streaks off the armor and ends up

00:57:50.557 --> 00:57:52.306
clattering to the ground somewhere near it.

00:57:52.306 --> 00:57:54.149
LIAM: Aw, honey badger don't give a shit.

00:57:54.149 --> 00:57:55.182
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:57:56.384 --> 00:57:57.342
MATT: All right.

00:57:57.342 --> 00:58:02.073
TRAVIS: That's 83 points of Divine Smite damage.

00:58:02.073 --> 00:58:03.439
SAM: Damn!
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:58:03.439 --> 00:58:05.255
ASHLEY: Wow!

00:58:05.255 --> 00:58:06.799
83 points?

00:58:06.799 --> 00:58:08.470
TRAVIS: Crit. Oh, and I got one more.

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:09.591
MATT: Paladin crits, they're nas--

00:58:09.591 --> 00:58:10.549
well, no, you get one attack

00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:11.984
because you have the reaction.
TRAVIS: Great.

00:58:11.984 --> 00:58:13.183
LIAM: Is there any wild magic?

00:58:13.183 --> 00:58:14.267
MATT: Well, no, you guys are holding your actions.

00:58:14.267 --> 00:58:15.225
So no, this--

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:16.516
You guys can--
TRAVIS: Doubles it all up.

00:58:16.516 --> 00:58:18.599
MATT: Correct. So you can take
another attack. It's all right.

00:58:18.599 --> 00:58:20.948
LIAM: Is there any shenanigans from his 20?

00:58:20.948 --> 00:58:21.781
LAURA: No.
LIAM: It's not magic?

00:58:21.781 --> 00:58:24.388
MATT: It's just a physical attack.

00:58:24.388 --> 00:58:26.849
LIAM: But not the smite, though? All right.

00:58:26.849 --> 00:58:29.211
I want something crazy to happen.

00:58:29.211 --> 00:58:30.316
MATT: It was Divine Smite.

00:58:30.316 --> 00:58:32.130
TRAVIS: 28, okay?

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:32.963
MATT: What's that?

00:58:32.963 --> 00:58:34.038
28 also hits.

00:58:34.038 --> 00:58:37.396
Roll a d100, if you don't mind.
SAM: Yeah!

00:58:37.396 --> 00:58:40.084
MATT: It was a melee attack, but since it was Divine Smite,

00:58:40.084 --> 00:58:43.549
there was some divine magic blasted into that.

00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:45.557
MARISHA: Give me something Fjord-ish.

00:58:45.557 --> 00:58:47.401
LAURA: Come on.
TRAVIS: (laughs) 65.

00:58:47.401 --> 00:58:48.427
LAURA: 65.

00:58:48.427 --> 00:58:50.539
MATT: 65.

00:58:50.539 --> 00:58:51.831
(chuckles)

00:58:51.831 --> 00:58:53.206
SAM: Oh no.
TALIESIN: No.

00:58:53.206 --> 00:58:54.220
ASHLEY: Oh no.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.593
MATT: Okay, okay.
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

00:58:56.593 --> 00:58:58.825
SAM: End of campaign.
MARISHA: What's about to happen?

00:59:00.034 --> 00:59:00.867
LAURA: What happens?

00:59:00.867 --> 00:59:02.249
MARISHA: Oh, this is a journey.
LIAM: Grog drops out of a portal.

00:59:02.249 --> 00:59:04.732
MATT: Sorry, I'm looking for something.

00:59:04.732 --> 00:59:07.111
SAM: Everyone you know and love died.

00:59:07.111 --> 00:59:10.507
MATT: Okay, no, I think, hilariously enough,

00:59:10.507 --> 00:59:12.179
as you strike them with this,

00:59:12.179 --> 00:59:14.041
the flash of divine energy smacks into it,

00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:15.881
and you watch the divine energy streak off

00:59:15.881 --> 00:59:18.241
and seem to float in the air for a second.

00:59:18.241 --> 00:59:20.998
Almost like time slowed down from the flash of the energy

00:59:20.998 --> 00:59:22.903
and they turn into a bunch of little butterflies.

00:59:22.903 --> 00:59:23.911
ALL: Again?

00:59:23.911 --> 00:59:27.000
MATT: You got the same spectrum.
MARISHA: Wait, how did you do that?

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.174
Is that what you rolled?

00:59:28.174 --> 00:59:30.043
LAURA: I guess I rolled a 65 as well.

00:59:30.043 --> 00:59:31.636
MATT: You rolled right in the same space, yeah.

00:59:31.636 --> 00:59:32.628
LAURA: Oh!

00:59:32.628 --> 00:59:35.101
MARISHA: ♪ Can you feel the love tonight ♪
SAM: You guys!

00:59:35.101 --> 00:59:37.091
MATT: So now it is surrounded by these

00:59:37.091 --> 00:59:40.080
slightly light green floating butterflies

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.470
that are just drifting around the creature.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:43.904
TRAVIS: Melora for the win.

00:59:43.904 --> 00:59:47.262
It was 17 points of damage for a total of 100.

00:59:47.262 --> 00:59:49.542
MATT: 100 damage on a held action.

00:59:49.542 --> 00:59:51.495
ASHLEY: Damn!
MATT: Not too bad. Not too bad.

00:59:51.495 --> 00:59:52.328
Okay.

00:59:52.328 --> 00:59:53.960
TALIESIN: I've got a Sacred Flame, also, so.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:54.920
MATT: All right, go for it.

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.142
TALIESIN: That's just a dex save.

00:59:56.142 --> 00:59:58.259
MATT: Dex save.

00:59:58.259 --> 00:59:59.092
TALIESIN: Prone.

01:00:00.158 --> 01:00:01.633
MATT: Well, prone--

01:00:01.633 --> 01:00:03.938
LAURA: I don't think you're at disadvantage on a dex save

01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:04.771
if you're prone, are you?

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:06.012
TALIESIN: Maybe not.
MATT: No, it doesn't.

01:00:06.012 --> 01:00:07.137
TALIESIN: All right.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.400
MATT: That would, even with the penalty, it's 19.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.645
TALIESIN: Yep. He saves. So that's--

01:00:10.645 --> 01:00:11.553
MATT: Rolled a natural 20.

01:00:11.553 --> 01:00:14.072
I'm getting all natural 20s on saves here.

01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:15.451
Not any attacks yet.

01:00:15.451 --> 01:00:16.284
All right.

01:00:17.873 --> 01:00:20.485
TALIESIN: That's 18 points halved, so.

01:00:20.485 --> 01:00:22.423
MATT: Mm-hmm, it's nine.
TALIESIN: Nine.

01:00:22.423 --> 01:00:23.541
ALL: <i>Nein</i>.

01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:24.492
MATT: For its return round,

01:00:24.492 --> 01:00:27.037
it's taken some heavy hits. Not too bad, not too bad.

01:00:27.037 --> 01:00:28.834
All right, that finishes all the held actions.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:29.949
TRAVIS: Yep.
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:00:29.949 --> 01:00:31.857
MATT: All right, as it stands there,

01:00:31.857 --> 01:00:36.137
it gets up from prone and one of his legs begins to step

01:00:36.137 --> 01:00:39.070
out of the hole that it's currently in.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:40.495
As it does,

01:00:40.495 --> 01:00:44.769
you watch as these runes in its body light up around it,

01:00:44.769 --> 01:00:49.343
and suddenly it emits steam from beneath the armor.

01:00:49.343 --> 01:00:52.733
This energy seems to just dissipate 10 feet around it.

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:53.904
Beau and Fjord,

01:00:53.904 --> 01:00:56.834
I need you both to make a wisdom saving throw, please.

01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:57.723
MARISHA: Oof.

01:00:57.723 --> 01:00:58.782
TRAVIS: Thank you for the d4.

01:00:58.782 --> 01:00:59.848
LIAM: Disco lights, here they come.

01:00:59.848 --> 01:01:01.693
MARISHA: Wisdom saving throw?

01:01:01.693 --> 01:01:02.893
MATT: Indeed.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:05.236
TALIESIN: I don't like that.

01:01:05.236 --> 01:01:08.025
MARISHA: Oh, it's cocked. It was cocked.

01:01:08.025 --> 01:01:09.875
That's terrible.
ASHLEY: I just look and go, I'm safe

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:10.708
up here.

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:12.652
TRAVIS: 18, with your Bless.

01:01:12.652 --> 01:01:13.947
SAM: 18's okay.

01:01:13.947 --> 01:01:14.806
LAURA: Maybe.

01:01:14.806 --> 01:01:16.747
MARISHA: 10.
MATT: 10.

01:01:16.747 --> 01:01:17.580
Both fail.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.997
(screaming)

01:01:20.873 --> 01:01:23.290
You are both slowed as you feel your bodies--

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:24.488
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

01:01:24.488 --> 01:01:25.404
MATT: Your body is suddenly like--

01:01:25.404 --> 01:01:26.437
LAURA: It's bad.

01:01:26.437 --> 01:01:29.175
MATT: Time seems to drag on and people around you begin

01:01:29.175 --> 01:01:30.389
to move faster and quicker.

01:01:30.389 --> 01:01:33.209
Your reaction time is nullified. You--

01:01:33.209 --> 01:01:35.225
TRAVIS: (slowed down) Help me!

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:37.081
MATT: Neither of you can use reactions.

01:01:37.081 --> 01:01:37.956
LAURA: Oh no.

01:01:37.956 --> 01:01:39.118
MATT: Your speed is halved,

01:01:39.118 --> 01:01:41.250
and you cannot make more than one attack a turn.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.216
TRAVIS: Okay. Ooh.

01:01:43.216 --> 01:01:45.809
SAM: Beau has been rendered useless.

01:01:45.809 --> 01:01:47.549
MARISHA: Awful.
ASHLEY: Bad.

01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:49.431
MARISHA: De-monked.

01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:50.531
TALIESIN: Wait.

01:01:50.531 --> 01:01:52.398
For the duration, target's movement is unaffected

01:01:52.398 --> 01:01:54.422
by difficult terrain and spells.

01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:55.752
And other magical effects can

01:01:55.752 --> 01:01:56.861
neither reduce the target's speed

01:01:56.861 --> 01:01:58.891
nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.

01:01:58.891 --> 01:02:00.850
MATT: Okay. So your speed's normal.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.574
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: But you're still slowed.

01:02:02.574 --> 01:02:03.978
Everything else still affects you.

01:02:03.978 --> 01:02:05.682
TRAVIS: Good.
MARISHA: Well, yeah.

01:02:05.682 --> 01:02:06.806
SAM: Okay, that helps. That helps.

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:08.349
MARISHA: So I'm only half-monked.

01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:12.775
MATT: Okay, and after that weird, like, energy steam emits,

01:02:12.775 --> 01:02:17.658
the red beam, right over to the one that banished it.

01:02:17.658 --> 01:02:18.491
And it begins to--
LAURA: Yeah, I did say,

01:02:18.491 --> 01:02:19.897
"It's me you want," after all.

01:02:19.897 --> 01:02:20.847
(laughter)

01:02:20.847 --> 01:02:22.914
TRAVIS: And you took its place!

01:02:22.914 --> 01:02:23.887
LAURA: Oops!

01:02:25.598 --> 01:02:27.626
Oh no! It can get all the way to me?!

01:02:27.626 --> 01:02:28.459
MATT: It can.

01:02:28.459 --> 01:02:29.797
LAURA: Oh no!

01:02:29.797 --> 01:02:31.268
TALIESIN: Even after getting up?
MATT: Oh, no, you know what?

01:02:31.268 --> 01:02:33.498
It doesn't get all the way to you because it was prone.

01:02:33.498 --> 01:02:34.829
(cheering)

01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:37.207
TALIESIN: I have to, I have to. I'm just, anything--

01:02:37.207 --> 01:02:38.286
MATT: There you go.
TRAVIS: You're fine.

01:02:38.286 --> 01:02:40.247
MATT: No, that's a valid point.

01:02:40.247 --> 01:02:42.043
So it begins to, like, gets up halfway

01:02:42.043 --> 01:02:43.923
and begins making its way in your direction.

01:02:43.923 --> 01:02:48.041
MARISHA: I can't even take a reaction to Sentinel him.

01:02:48.041 --> 01:02:49.354
MATT: That finishes its turn.

01:02:49.354 --> 01:02:52.670
TRAVIS: Oh! Fucking run!
MATT: That brings it to Veth.

01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:54.112
You're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

01:02:54.112 --> 01:02:56.028
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:02:56.028 --> 01:02:59.563
SAM: Did it see me? Am I hidden?

01:02:59.563 --> 01:03:00.438
MATT: You are not hidden,

01:03:00.438 --> 01:03:01.761
when you revealed yourself when you attacked.

01:03:01.761 --> 01:03:03.102
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:03.102 --> 01:03:05.822
(laughter)

01:03:05.822 --> 01:03:08.930
SAM: Well, that limits me.
ASHLEY: What is this shirt?

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:09.994
MARISHA: Oh, yes.

01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:12.344
MATT: (laughs)

01:03:12.344 --> 01:03:16.468
Yes. Let you all suffer as I have suffered for years!

01:03:16.468 --> 01:03:17.301
LAURA: Oh no.

01:03:17.301 --> 01:03:18.386
SAM: I am cute.

01:03:18.386 --> 01:03:22.425
MARISHA: Young Ashley kind of looks like young Billy Boyd.

01:03:22.425 --> 01:03:26.227
LAURA: Oh my god!
ASHLEY: Hell yes! Thanks!

01:03:26.227 --> 01:03:28.284
LAURA: In the cutest way. I love Billy Boyd!

01:03:28.284 --> 01:03:30.452
MATT: (like Pippin Took) What about second breakfast?

01:03:30.452 --> 01:03:31.598
I dig it.

01:03:31.598 --> 01:03:32.798
LIAM: Second eye!

01:03:32.798 --> 01:03:34.734
MATT: (laughs)

01:03:34.734 --> 01:03:37.830
ASHLEY: I always wanted to be an elf, but I'm a hobbit.

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:40.163
(laughter)
TRAVIS: You were born of this world.

01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:43.094
MATT: All right. So, what're you doing, Veth?

01:03:43.094 --> 01:03:44.619
SAM: Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:47.575
Gotta protect Jester.

01:03:47.575 --> 01:03:50.748
Gotta do all kinds of stuff.

01:03:50.748 --> 01:03:51.998
I can't do much

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.901
because some of these things are concentration,

01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:57.046
and then Yasha will fall.

01:03:57.046 --> 01:03:58.846
So that's no good.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:03.483
So why don't I just shoot something at it?

01:04:03.483 --> 01:04:04.840
How about this?

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.628
(breathes heavily)

01:04:08.628 --> 01:04:11.527
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:04:11.527 --> 01:04:13.520
SAM: I'm going to try something stupid.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.644
MATT: Do it.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:04:14.644 --> 01:04:16.873
TRAVIS: Let's go.
SAM: A long time ago.

01:04:16.873 --> 01:04:17.883
MARISHA: Yes.
TALIESIN: In a galaxy--

01:04:17.883 --> 01:04:21.175
SAM: Jester painted me a banana peel.

01:04:21.175 --> 01:04:23.019
MARISHA: Yes.
SAM: It's a magical banana peel.

01:04:23.019 --> 01:04:25.562
LAURA: (cackles)
MARISHA: Yes.

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:27.881
SAM: I'm going to sneak up and throw it

01:04:27.881 --> 01:04:30.759
right in front of the monster's foot

01:04:30.759 --> 01:04:32.703
and see if it will slip on the banana peel.

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:35.080
MATT: Okay. Okay.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.222
So if you're going to sneak up, roll a stealth check.

01:04:37.222 --> 01:04:38.297
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:38.297 --> 01:04:40.081
LAURA: This is so stupid.

01:04:42.019 --> 01:04:43.929
SAM: (stutters) A lot. 34.

01:04:43.929 --> 01:04:44.762
MATT: All right.

01:04:44.762 --> 01:04:46.552
So you bonus action hide behind there.

01:04:46.552 --> 01:04:48.310
SAM: Yeah, and then like, sort of make my way around,

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:49.710
through the--
MATT: Coast along the sides here.

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:51.397
SAM: Yeah. Yep.
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

01:04:51.397 --> 01:04:52.901
MATT: And grab the edge, leap up,

01:04:52.901 --> 01:04:54.601
and chuck it out there.

01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:56.817
SAM: Because it's making its way towards Jester,

01:04:56.817 --> 01:04:57.650
so like--
MATT: Towards Jester, yep.

01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:59.192
SAM: -- just toss it right in front of that foot.

01:04:59.192 --> 01:05:00.400
MATT: You got it.
SAM: That's it.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.732
MATT: Okay. Okay.

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:02.718
All right. That's your turn?

01:05:02.718 --> 01:05:03.634
SAM: Yep.
TRAVIS: I like it.

01:05:03.634 --> 01:05:04.700
MARISHA: So funny.
MATT: Okay.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.907
That brings us to Yasha.

01:05:05.907 --> 01:05:09.755
Yasha, you are on the ceiling and levitating, free-floating.

01:05:09.755 --> 01:05:11.439
ASHLEY: Okay, I think I'm still going to try to go

01:05:11.439 --> 01:05:12.449
to town on this thing.

01:05:12.449 --> 01:05:13.282
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:05:15.606 --> 01:05:18.756
ASHLEY: Wonder if I should just hack
at it or try to pull it down.

01:05:20.442 --> 01:05:21.887
(growls)

01:05:21.887 --> 01:05:23.212
LIAM: Ack, ack, ack, ack.

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:25.837
LIAM and MARISHA: ♪ You oughta know by now. ♪
ASHLEY: All right. I'll try to--

01:05:25.837 --> 01:05:27.968
I'll try to keep prying it out.

01:05:27.968 --> 01:05:29.352
MATT: Roll a strength check.

01:05:29.352 --> 01:05:31.899
LIAM: ♪ Yasha can't fight with a broken back. ♪

01:05:31.899 --> 01:05:34.505
SAM: When did you start rolling like me?
TRAVIS: You're raging, right?

01:05:34.505 --> 01:05:36.393
ASHLEY: Shitty? Yeah.

01:05:36.393 --> 01:05:37.942
Still raging.

01:05:37.942 --> 01:05:38.933
MATT: You're not--
ASHLEY: Oh, I wasn't hit.

01:05:38.933 --> 01:05:40.559
MATT: You're not attacking and you're not being hit.

01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:42.634
This isn't mid-battle. This is just
trying to pull something free.

01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:43.611
So every turn you do this,

01:05:43.611 --> 01:05:45.335
you are expending a rage to do so.

01:05:45.335 --> 01:05:46.442
So you have to decide.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.405
TRAVIS: You have a limited number.

01:05:48.405 --> 01:05:50.226
MARISHA: Is it per day or per short rest?

01:05:50.226 --> 01:05:51.059
TRAVIS: Per day.

01:05:51.059 --> 01:05:53.605
ASHLEY: Yeah, per long rest. I have five.

01:05:53.605 --> 01:05:55.193
Yeah. Forever.

01:05:55.193 --> 01:05:57.946
Um, um, um, um, um.

01:05:57.946 --> 01:05:58.779
Fuck!

01:05:59.881 --> 01:06:01.043
Okay. I'm going to rage again.

01:06:01.043 --> 01:06:02.435
SAM: Yeah!
MATT: Okay.

01:06:03.476 --> 01:06:05.163
So you have advantage for a second roll.

01:06:05.163 --> 01:06:06.964
TRAVIS: Slap yourself.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

MATT: 18.

01:06:13.379 --> 01:06:14.220
It's getting closer.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.120
You are slowly prying it free, it's just not coming out.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.355
It is starting to show some looseness to it.

01:06:21.355 --> 01:06:22.792
All right.

01:06:22.792 --> 01:06:23.719
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:06:23.719 --> 01:06:25.249
MATT: So that's your action.

01:06:25.249 --> 01:06:26.187
If you want to keep going,

01:06:26.187 --> 01:06:30.104
you could stay there, or you can attempt to move.

01:06:32.263 --> 01:06:33.383
ASHLEY: I'll stay since I'm up there.

01:06:33.383 --> 01:06:35.818
MATT: You got it, all right. That finishes your go.

01:06:35.818 --> 01:06:38.493
Fjord, you're up. Beau, you're on deck.

01:06:38.493 --> 01:06:41.435
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action to cast

01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:44.369
Hexblade's Curse on this giant--

01:06:44.369 --> 01:06:45.649
Wait. Yes.

01:06:45.649 --> 01:06:47.904
MATT: Hexblade's Curse, is that once per day?

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:48.737
TRAVIS: It is--

01:06:49.976 --> 01:06:52.143
MATT: Long rest or short rest?

01:06:53.312 --> 01:06:54.691
TRAVIS: Once per short rest.

01:06:54.691 --> 01:06:56.265
MATT: Short rest. And you guys did have a short rest?

01:06:56.265 --> 01:06:57.098
TRAVIS: We did.
MATT: Yes.

01:06:57.098 --> 01:06:58.624
TRAVIS: Yeah. We healed up.

01:06:58.624 --> 01:07:02.775
MATT: So it is indeed cursed.

01:07:02.775 --> 01:07:06.613
TRAVIS: And I will actually use my movement--

01:07:06.613 --> 01:07:08.248
MATT: In addition, the target can either take an action

01:07:08.248 --> 01:07:10.189
or a bonus action on its turn, not both.

01:07:10.189 --> 01:07:12.339
So you can either curse or you can take an action.

01:07:12.339 --> 01:07:13.172
Your call.

01:07:13.172 --> 01:07:15.528
TRAVIS: I understand. I will take the curse off.

01:07:15.528 --> 01:07:17.228
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: And I will--

01:07:17.228 --> 01:07:19.216
So if my movement speed is 30,

01:07:19.216 --> 01:07:20.617
that means I have 15 now?

01:07:20.617 --> 01:07:21.450
MATT: Correct.

01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:23.485
TRAVIS: So I'm going to use 15 to move away from it

01:07:23.485 --> 01:07:24.759
back towards that corner.

01:07:24.759 --> 01:07:26.404
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: And I will fire--

01:07:26.404 --> 01:07:28.925
MATT: It will use its reaction to swing back

01:07:28.925 --> 01:07:32.458
at you with its bladed lance, because it has a reach.

01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:33.669
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:07:33.669 --> 01:07:35.368

01:08:26.113 --> 01:08:28.288
this lance pierces out middle of his stomach

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:35.915

TRAVIS: Do I just get one of the three

LAURA: He has a lance

01:09:28.843 --> 01:09:29.709
through his belly.
MATT: No. Technically,

01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:31.384
it's not an attack, it's an action.
ASHLEY: That happened so fast!

01:09:31.384 --> 01:09:33.020

TRAVIS: That's a 24 for the first one.

01:09:37.374 --> 01:09:40.104

28 on the second.

MATT: All three hit.
TRAVIS: On the third one.

01:10:03.558 --> 01:10:06.607
I am so fucking harpooned right now. I can't think.

01:10:07.849 --> 01:10:09.915
That's-- plus three, 13,

01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:11.317
so that's 16 points of damage.

01:10:11.317 --> 01:10:13.038
LAURA: And that was just on his reaction.

01:10:13.038 --> 01:10:16.417

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:20.456
TRAVIS: 14 points of damage.
MATT: 14. Nice.

01:10:20.456 --> 01:10:21.411
TRAVIS: And then--

01:10:21.411 --> 01:10:22.646
LAURA: I barfed a little bit in the mouth.

01:10:22.646 --> 01:10:26.641
TRAVIS: Nine plus three is 12. 12 points of damage.

01:10:26.641 --> 01:10:28.823
MATT: Got it. Nice. Still a decent round on it.

01:10:28.823 --> 01:10:32.617
So as you're (groan). You lean back and release it,

01:10:32.617 --> 01:10:33.766
but it's a slow arc.

01:10:33.766 --> 01:10:35.295
And as they fire out, (impacts)

01:10:35.295 --> 01:10:37.051
they blast into its chest, leaving these

01:10:37.051 --> 01:10:39.264
scorch marks and part of the broken armor

01:10:39.264 --> 01:10:40.713
is a little crinkled inwards.

01:10:40.713 --> 01:10:44.480
TRAVIS: I just look out everybody and go: Ah! Ah!

01:10:51.662 --> 01:10:53.048
MATT: You currently cannot see this happening.

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:54.742
You're hiding behind the wall

01:10:54.742 --> 01:10:55.697
and trying to avoid this creature.

01:10:55.697 --> 01:10:57.417
And you just hear the noises from around the side,

01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:58.928
but you do not have an eye line to Fjord on this.

01:10:58.928 --> 01:10:59.973

MARISHA: Okay.

01:10:59.973 --> 01:11:00.806

01:11:10.993 --> 01:11:11.826
MARISHA: Okay.

01:11:11.826 --> 01:11:14.118

01:11:14.118 --> 01:11:17.672
MARISHA: So my mind is blown by seeing Fjord impaled.

01:11:17.672 --> 01:11:20.355
I'm just going to run over,

01:11:20.355 --> 01:11:21.946
which is weird because I can move--

01:11:21.946 --> 01:11:26.319
I can run fast, but my arms are in slow motion.

01:11:26.319 --> 01:11:27.596
MATT: Yeah, you are--

01:11:27.596 --> 01:11:29.182
you are a walking speed ramp shot, is what you are.

01:11:29.182 --> 01:11:31.108

01:11:31.108 --> 01:11:33.882

01:11:33.882 --> 01:11:35.899
MATT: All right. Are you going for the creature?

01:11:35.899 --> 01:11:39.532
MARISHA: I am going to utilize his lance

01:11:39.532 --> 01:11:41.699
being impaled through Fjord. Sorry, Fjord.

01:11:41.699 --> 01:11:43.780
I'm going to jump up on the lance.

MARISHA: And I'm going scurry.

01:11:48.996 --> 01:11:53.645
I'm going to use it to scurry up his shoulders.

01:11:53.645 --> 01:11:55.357
TRAVIS: (retches)

01:11:55.357 --> 01:11:56.865
MARISHA: I have one good-- one attack.

01:11:56.865 --> 01:11:59.307
And I'm going to take my bo and I'm going to try

01:11:59.307 --> 01:12:04.153
and jam it down in between his plate and his--

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:04.986
SAM: Jam on it.

01:12:04.986 --> 01:12:07.236

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:11.919
with disadvantage because you are slowed.

01:12:11.919 --> 01:12:13.210

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:14.740

01:12:17.137 --> 01:12:19.318

MATT: It would make sense.

01:12:19.318 --> 01:12:22.817
MARISHA: Just straight acrobatics?
MATT: Sure. Straight acrobatics.

01:12:22.817 --> 01:12:23.952
MARISHA: Okay.

01:12:24.877 --> 01:12:25.821
25.

01:12:25.821 --> 01:12:29.879
MATT: 25? Yeah, you manage to leap off of the harpoon

01:12:29.879 --> 01:12:32.718
with a slight jostling of your body. Leap up,

01:12:32.718 --> 01:12:34.191
come up the side, and now you're on top,

01:12:34.191 --> 01:12:36.573
standing over it, and you can look down into that,

01:12:36.573 --> 01:12:39.716
one of the larger separations in its armor,

01:12:39.716 --> 01:12:41.885
where you can see these arcane sparks

01:12:41.885 --> 01:12:44.980
jumping back and forth in the middle of its torso cage.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.355
So go ahead and make the attack.
MARISHA: I'm just going to try

01:12:46.355 --> 01:12:47.230
and plunge it in there.

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:51.196
So just one. Just, nope, only one pop, right?

01:12:51.196 --> 01:12:52.329
LAURA: What if we can't--
MARISHA: Oh, my god!

01:12:52.329 --> 01:12:53.953
TALIESIN: d4.
MARISHA: It's not going to make it.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:55.361
TALIESIN: I know.

01:12:55.361 --> 01:12:57.113
MARISHA: I rolled terribly.
TRAVIS: I'm right here.

01:12:57.113 --> 01:12:59.025
MARISHA: No.
TALIESIN: No.

01:12:59.025 --> 01:12:59.858
MARISHA: 15.

01:12:59.858 --> 01:13:02.258
MATT: 15. Unfortunately--
MARISHA: 17. 17.

01:13:02.258 --> 01:13:04.885
MATT: You try and slam it downward
and it jostles just enough that

01:13:04.885 --> 01:13:09.533
you have to spend most of your physical mindset to stay

01:13:09.533 --> 01:13:11.463
atop of it without falling into it.

01:13:11.463 --> 01:13:12.488
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: No impact.

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.200
I do need both of you to,

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.033
at the end of your turn to make

01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:16.191
the saving throws again for me.

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.031
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:13:17.031 --> 01:13:18.190
SAM: Wisdom, again?

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:19.564
MATT: Yes. Wisdom.
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:13:19.564 --> 01:13:20.937
LAURA: We can save against it.

01:13:20.937 --> 01:13:22.500
MARISHA: Natural 20!

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.769
TALIESIN: Not even with a d4?

01:13:23.769 --> 01:13:26.943
MARISHA: 20, not even with a d4. 25 total!

01:13:26.943 --> 01:13:28.692
MATT: All right. So you are no longer slowed.

01:13:29.942 --> 01:13:31.946
You, however, unfortunately are, Fjord.

01:13:31.946 --> 01:13:33.396
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Payback.

01:13:33.396 --> 01:13:35.702
TALIESIN: What was in that gas, man?

01:13:35.702 --> 01:13:38.350
LAURA: (laughs)

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:39.390
TALIESIN: I'm talking about-- this is what you get

01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:41.474
for talking about farts.

01:13:41.474 --> 01:13:43.836
MATT: Caduceus, it's your turn.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:46.186
TALIESIN: That's not cool.
MATT: Caleb, you're on deck.

01:13:46.186 --> 01:13:47.623
LIAM: Okay.

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:48.623
TALIESIN: All right.

01:13:49.616 --> 01:13:52.675
I don't have a ton I can do, so.

01:13:55.415 --> 01:13:56.473
That's-- he's too far.

01:13:56.473 --> 01:13:59.017
Fjord's way too far for me to reach him.

01:14:00.167 --> 01:14:01.141
MATT: Basically, yeah.

01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:02.600
TALIESIN: Okay. That's fine.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.326
I'm going to take a couple steps forward

01:14:04.326 --> 01:14:05.355
and I'm just going to do,

01:14:05.355 --> 01:14:09.026
because I've got nothing better to do at the moment,

01:14:09.026 --> 01:14:11.544
I'm going to cast another Sacred Flame.

01:14:11.544 --> 01:14:14.071
MATT: Okay. Dex save?
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:14:14.071 --> 01:14:14.929
MATT: 13.

01:14:14.929 --> 01:14:15.870
TALIESIN: Nope.

01:14:16.772 --> 01:14:18.772
Hey, that's really good!

01:14:19.934 --> 01:14:24.030
That's 10, 18, 19--

01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:25.044
24 points.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:25.969
MATT: 24 points. Nice.
MARISHA: It's so cute.

01:14:25.969 --> 01:14:27.136
LAURA: Yeah. It's really cute.

01:14:27.136 --> 01:14:27.969
MARISHA: I love it.

01:14:27.969 --> 01:14:29.916
MATT: All righty. Well done.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:33.074
MATT: So that's your action, and that's 10 feet of movement?

01:14:33.074 --> 01:14:36.586
TALIESIN: Yep. I'm just going to stay there for now.

01:14:36.586 --> 01:14:37.552
MATT: Okay. You got it.

01:14:37.552 --> 01:14:39.318
That finishes your go. Caleb, you're up.

01:14:39.318 --> 01:14:41.946
LIAM: Okay, I will move towards the center of the room,

01:14:41.946 --> 01:14:44.717
and with Fjord in my eyesight, I will call out:

01:14:44.717 --> 01:14:47.111
Fjord! I am so sorry.

01:14:47.111 --> 01:14:49.674
You are not going to like any part of this.

01:14:49.674 --> 01:14:52.522
And I use my bonus action to send Cat's Ire claw

01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:54.154
and surround him.

01:14:54.154 --> 01:14:55.732
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:14:55.732 --> 01:14:59.067
LIAM: And then pull him to the left.

01:14:59.067 --> 01:15:01.203
TRAVIS: (panting heavily)
LAURA: Pull him to the left!?

01:15:01.203 --> 01:15:02.036
TALIESIN: Throw him to me. Throw him to me.

01:15:02.036 --> 01:15:04.960
MATT: Go ahead. Go ahead and-- yeah, push him even further.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.401
(laughter)
TRAVIS: (screaming)

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:10.127
LIAM: Just going to put some peppers and onions on this.

01:15:10.127 --> 01:15:12.510
(laughter)

01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:15.748
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20, adding eight to it.

01:15:15.748 --> 01:15:17.535
LIAM: Is he-- are you willing?

01:15:17.535 --> 01:15:18.572
TRAVIS: Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:15:18.572 --> 01:15:19.405
LIAM: Okay.

01:15:19.405 --> 01:15:20.691
MATT: This is against the creature's grapple.

01:15:20.691 --> 01:15:21.524
LIAM: Okay.

01:15:21.524 --> 01:15:23.609
Aw, I thought it would be Fjord, okay.

01:15:23.609 --> 01:15:24.774
It's just a 16.

01:15:24.774 --> 01:15:25.632
MATT: 16.

01:15:25.632 --> 01:15:26.465
That does actually work.

01:15:26.465 --> 01:15:27.847
(cheering)

01:15:27.847 --> 01:15:28.950
It's a 13 on its end.

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:31.109
It has a great bonus, but it rolled low.

01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:34.448
So you do manage to (whooshing). No longer grappled.

01:15:34.448 --> 01:15:38.448
You do, using the cat's cradle, yank Fjord back off of it.

01:15:38.448 --> 01:15:41.274
The barb tears through again.

01:15:41.274 --> 01:15:42.131
TRAVIS: (whimpers)

01:15:42.131 --> 01:15:44.923
MATT: I'll say for that. (laughs)

01:15:44.923 --> 01:15:49.752
(laughing) You take another four points of piercing damage.

01:15:49.752 --> 01:15:52.677
(laughter)

01:15:52.677 --> 01:15:53.968
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Thank you.

01:15:53.968 --> 01:15:56.880
(laughter)

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.360
MATT: But you are no longer grappled.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.875
(laughter)

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:02.864
LIAM: That was a bonus action.

01:16:02.864 --> 01:16:04.866
So my hand is outstretched for that.

01:16:04.866 --> 01:16:07.530
Then my left hand just does a little curve ball

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:09.732
Fire Bolt, which is my action.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.644
MATT: You got it.

01:16:11.644 --> 01:16:13.025
LIAM: Ranged spell attack.

01:16:13.025 --> 01:16:15.987
That is a-- oh, it's a 20, which doesn't hit.

01:16:15.987 --> 01:16:17.638
MATT: 20 does not hit.
LIAM: Because it's so tough. All right.

01:16:17.638 --> 01:16:19.217
MATT: Indeed. Sorry, buddy.

01:16:19.217 --> 01:16:20.154
LIAM: That's okay.

01:16:20.154 --> 01:16:21.933
MATT: All right. Is that your turn?

01:16:21.933 --> 01:16:23.400
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Jester, you're up.

01:16:24.565 --> 01:16:26.119
LAURA: Okay.

01:16:26.119 --> 01:16:28.177
I am going to

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:32.373
step out and say:

01:16:32.373 --> 01:16:36.380
It's me you want! And cast Banishment again.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.526
I'm going to banish him again.

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:38.609
MATT: Okay. What's the--
LAURA: And I'm going to assume

01:16:38.609 --> 01:16:40.353
he can't do it, because he rolled a 19

01:16:40.353 --> 01:16:43.254
and a 20 the last time and it still banished him,

01:16:43.254 --> 01:16:45.109
so he's definitely going to go away.
MATT: Yeah.

01:16:45.109 --> 01:16:48.298
SAM: That's fair.
MATT: Just going to roll for the fun of it.

01:16:48.298 --> 01:16:49.664
He's rolling super high.

01:16:49.664 --> 01:16:51.283
It was another 19, but no.

01:16:51.283 --> 01:16:53.332
TALIESIN: Get them out of your system now.

01:16:53.332 --> 01:16:57.376
MATT: So as it's running, (booming steps, whooshes).

01:16:57.376 --> 01:16:58.757
And it vanishes yet again.

01:16:58.757 --> 01:17:00.095
Beau, you fall.

01:17:00.095 --> 01:17:00.958
MARISHA: Ah!

01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:02.626
LIAM: Auto-banish is pretty cool.

01:17:02.626 --> 01:17:04.245
LAURA: Auto-banish is nice.
MATT: And take six points

01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:05.078
of bludgeoning damage.

01:17:05.078 --> 01:17:07.798
MARISHA: Even though I have slow fall, as a monk?

01:17:07.798 --> 01:17:08.939
MATT: Yes, you take no damage.

01:17:08.939 --> 01:17:09.772
MARISHA: No damage?

01:17:09.772 --> 01:17:12.477
MATT: None, as I knock everything over.

01:17:12.477 --> 01:17:14.993
Three point land on the ground. No issue.

01:17:14.993 --> 01:17:16.751
TALIESIN: Immediately--

01:17:16.751 --> 01:17:17.999
LAURA: Heal them!

01:17:17.999 --> 01:17:19.332
SAM: Heal Fjord.

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:24.128
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- let's see, hold on.

01:17:24.128 --> 01:17:25.582
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:17:25.582 --> 01:17:27.112
TRAVIS: I don't want to look.

01:17:27.112 --> 01:17:28.567
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to heal Fjord,

01:17:28.567 --> 01:17:30.804
but I will figure out how much that is and when--

01:17:30.804 --> 01:17:31.637
MATT: Okay.

01:17:31.637 --> 01:17:33.374
Everyone else, you have a minute.

01:17:33.374 --> 01:17:34.207
LAURA: A minute!

01:17:34.207 --> 01:17:35.681
SAM: Keep hacking away at it!
LIAM: The claw will dive

01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:37.731
back up next to Yasha to help.
MATT: All right.

01:17:37.731 --> 01:17:39.823
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what if we can't
pull this thing because of the--

01:17:39.823 --> 01:17:41.065
maybe it's, like, the orbs or the--

01:17:41.065 --> 01:17:42.514
LAURA: You can try. Try it! Try it!

01:17:42.514 --> 01:17:43.697
You were getting it.
LIAM: -- five times,

01:17:43.697 --> 01:17:44.990
and I don't have to rage, I could just--

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:46.038
ASHLEY: Could you slap me?

01:17:46.038 --> 01:17:47.412
LAURA: It's been, you have 10 rounds.

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:48.957
You have a whole minute now. Just go.

01:17:48.957 --> 01:17:50.303
SAM: Yeah, you can slap her.

01:17:50.303 --> 01:17:51.660
LIAM: The claw goes (impacts)

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.724
ASHLEY: (roars)

01:17:52.724 --> 01:17:53.557
TRAVIS: (roars)

01:17:53.557 --> 01:17:55.441
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

01:17:55.441 --> 01:17:58.123
ASHLEY: Will that work? Can I keep my rage that way?

01:17:58.123 --> 01:17:59.369
LIAM: That's probably my action.

01:17:59.369 --> 01:18:01.545
MATT: I will say by the time it comes back around,

01:18:01.545 --> 01:18:03.359
because that was his action, doing that.

01:18:03.359 --> 01:18:05.237
The rage would have dropped before it got to you.

01:18:05.237 --> 01:18:06.411
ASHLEY: Probably.
MATT: So you have to spend a rage again.

01:18:06.411 --> 01:18:08.535
But from there, that point forward,

01:18:08.535 --> 01:18:10.879
if you want to keep using the claw to plink her,

01:18:10.879 --> 01:18:12.169
to keep her angry, I'd allow it.

01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:14.795
MARISHA: Pretty good.

01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:16.169
LIAM: That's what I'll do initially,

01:18:16.169 --> 01:18:18.551
but just assume that on each subsequent round

01:18:18.551 --> 01:18:19.914
I actually just go like this to your back

01:18:19.914 --> 01:18:22.357
and just start sinking claw in to push forward.

01:18:22.357 --> 01:18:23.572
LAURA: Ooh.
MATT: That'll do it.

01:18:23.572 --> 01:18:25.355
MARISHA: That's hot.
ASHLEY: I love it. Okay.

01:18:25.355 --> 01:18:27.200
TALIESIN: 13 points just to--

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.474
TRAVIS: No. Yeah. I'll take it.

01:18:28.474 --> 01:18:29.474
TALIESIN: 13 points.

01:18:31.227 --> 01:18:33.570
TRAVIS: I will also heal myself a little.

01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:35.894
MATT: Yeah. There's a moment of shock, Fjord,

01:18:35.894 --> 01:18:39.512
as it vanishes and the cat releases you and you look down.

01:18:39.512 --> 01:18:42.563
and the armor, the plate is wedged apart,

01:18:42.563 --> 01:18:43.864
and you look down to see how bad it is

01:18:43.864 --> 01:18:45.277
and you just see a hole.

01:18:45.277 --> 01:18:49.603
Like, a hole that big where it's just muscle and blood.

01:18:49.603 --> 01:18:51.741
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at 1st-level.

01:18:51.741 --> 01:18:53.051
Sorry. So that's--

01:18:53.051 --> 01:18:55.837
LIAM: Wait. Put the Cloven Crystal back in him first.

01:18:55.837 --> 01:18:58.427
(laughter)

01:18:58.427 --> 01:18:59.655
MATT: Just plug it.

01:18:59.655 --> 01:19:01.129
TRAVIS: He's got this little tumor for the rest of the campaign.

01:19:01.129 --> 01:19:04.493
Like, how's it going?

01:19:04.493 --> 01:19:05.502
MATT: All righty.

01:19:05.502 --> 01:19:07.471
LAURA: 12 points of healing as well from me.

01:19:07.471 --> 01:19:09.278
TRAVIS: 12. Amazing.

01:19:09.278 --> 01:19:12.131
And I'll do 1st-level Cure Wounds

01:19:12.131 --> 01:19:13.101
on myself as well.

01:19:13.101 --> 01:19:14.871
LAURA: We got to figure out something to do

01:19:14.871 --> 01:19:16.367
to attack him right away.

01:19:16.367 --> 01:19:18.933
MARISHA: I'll get into place and hold my attack.

01:19:18.933 --> 01:19:20.382
MATT: Yasha, are you trying again?
ASHLEY: Yep.

01:19:20.382 --> 01:19:22.207
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: You also get to make saves.

01:19:22.207 --> 01:19:24.434
You get to make 10 saves.

01:19:24.434 --> 01:19:26.420
MATT: Correct, Fjord. Make some saves for me.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.948
TALIESIN: You get 10 saves against Slow.

01:19:27.948 --> 01:19:28.781
ASHLEY: Nope.

01:19:28.781 --> 01:19:32.747
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. That was 11 points of healing.

01:19:32.747 --> 01:19:33.932
MATT: No?
ASHLEY: Nope.

01:19:33.932 --> 01:19:35.017
TRAVIS: Okay. 10 saves.

01:19:35.017 --> 01:19:36.646
MATT: Claw crushes. Roll again.

01:19:36.646 --> 01:19:38.431
LIAM: I'm going to burn another spell slot

01:19:38.431 --> 01:19:40.103
to keep this thing alive, too, by the way.

01:19:40.103 --> 01:19:41.736
TRAVIS: Natural 20. There it goes.
LIAM: Because it's only a minute.

01:19:41.736 --> 01:19:43.554
MATT: There you go. You're no longer slowed.

01:19:43.554 --> 01:19:46.137
MARISHA: Will you remove my Slow, too?

01:19:47.356 --> 01:19:48.959
LAURA: (imitates Marisha) Will you remove my Slow, too?

01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:50.351
MATT: I did.
MARISHA: Oh. I thought it was still--

01:19:50.351 --> 01:19:51.625
what's on me?
MATT: That is your Bless.

01:19:51.625 --> 01:19:52.458
MARISHA: Oh!

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:53.678
MATT: All that Bless lasts for a minute, though.

01:19:53.678 --> 01:19:56.005
So that will fade before it returns as well.

01:19:56.005 --> 01:19:57.437
LAURA: We can bring it back?

01:19:57.437 --> 01:19:58.917
TALIESIN: Yeah, I will once it's time.

01:19:58.917 --> 01:20:00.819
SAM: Matthew, I'd like to walk up the stairs,

01:20:00.819 --> 01:20:03.084
grab my dagger, and walk back down again.

01:20:03.084 --> 01:20:04.200
MATT: Okay.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.538
SAM: And hide in a slightly different position,

01:20:07.538 --> 01:20:11.288
but close by, and just ready a dagger throw.

01:20:11.288 --> 01:20:12.121
MATT: You got it.

01:20:12.121 --> 01:20:13.438
The banana peel still is out there

01:20:13.438 --> 01:20:15.213
in the middle of the floor.

01:20:15.213 --> 01:20:17.336
SAM: Soon as it gets back, it's going to slip.

01:20:17.336 --> 01:20:18.177
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll move.

01:20:18.177 --> 01:20:20.100
I'll actually move over here.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.200
MATT: Over here?
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.432
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to move

01:20:22.432 --> 01:20:23.890
and hide on the other orb.

01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:25.494
I want to be in a completely different place

01:20:25.494 --> 01:20:26.512
than I was before.

01:20:26.512 --> 01:20:27.932
MATT: Over here?

01:20:27.932 --> 01:20:28.765
LAURA: No. Down.

01:20:28.765 --> 01:20:30.211
Hiding as much as I can.

01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:31.044
MATT: Right here, you mean?

01:20:31.044 --> 01:20:32.639
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:20:32.639 --> 01:20:34.152
MARISHA: And put me where--

01:20:34.152 --> 01:20:35.984
since it was heading towards Jester,

01:20:35.984 --> 01:20:38.888
put me in her path, on this side,

01:20:38.888 --> 01:20:41.092
but still closer. A little closer.

01:20:41.092 --> 01:20:44.129
Still so it's towards the banana peel.

01:20:44.129 --> 01:20:44.971
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:47.506
TRAVIS: That is where he's coming. I don't want to be here!

01:20:47.506 --> 01:20:49.484
(laughter)

01:20:49.484 --> 01:20:51.468
TRAVIS: I'll go down here, down in the middle.

01:20:51.468 --> 01:20:53.784
LIAM: And Matt, Caleb backed about

01:20:53.784 --> 01:20:55.693
15 or 20 feet away from you.
TRAVIS: Not to abandon you,

01:20:55.693 --> 01:20:56.859
but fuck that thing.
MATT: Right here?

01:20:56.859 --> 01:20:57.974
MARISHA: No, you're good.

01:20:57.974 --> 01:20:59.176
You're good.

01:20:59.176 --> 01:21:00.642
TALIESIN: And I can get with Bless--

01:21:00.642 --> 01:21:02.422
MARISHA: He just Death Becomes Her'd you.
TALIESIN: -- one, two, three, four.

01:21:02.422 --> 01:21:03.839
I'm going to get--

01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:08.457
I'm going to get the four of us right there.

01:21:08.457 --> 01:21:11.481
I think-- can I get four or five right now?

01:21:11.481 --> 01:21:13.420
I mean, how many people can I Bless right now?

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.976
MATT: If you were to come down here to cast it,

01:21:14.976 --> 01:21:17.918
you could get everybody except for Beauregard.

01:21:17.918 --> 01:21:19.085
TALIESIN: So that's--

01:21:20.705 --> 01:21:22.363
Well, right now, I can only do

01:21:22.363 --> 01:21:25.134
four people other than myself, anyway, so.

01:21:25.134 --> 01:21:26.364
TALIESIN: Everybody except for Beauregard

01:21:26.364 --> 01:21:27.889
and technically--

01:21:27.889 --> 01:21:30.264
No, Yasha would be in range because
you'd be close to where she is.

01:21:31.464 --> 01:21:32.811
It's up to you.

01:21:32.811 --> 01:21:34.469
TALIESIN: I'll get--

01:21:34.469 --> 01:21:37.219
MATT: You'd have to be down here.
TALIESIN: I have no spells left.

01:21:38.197 --> 01:21:40.730
So 3rd-level, hold on. All right, doing it.

01:21:43.217 --> 01:21:45.956
So that's three, four, five, so.

01:21:45.956 --> 01:21:46.789
MATT: Blessed.

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.355
Blessed.
TALIESIN: Two.

01:21:51.187 --> 01:21:52.090
MATT: So that's five there,

01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:54.193
and then Yasha would be a sixth.

01:21:54.193 --> 01:21:55.705
TALIESIN: I'll get Yasha instead of Caleb.

01:21:55.705 --> 01:21:58.964
MARISHA: If I moved closer to him,
would I be able to get it?

01:22:00.256 --> 01:22:02.225
TALIESIN: I'd have to pull it from someone else.

01:22:02.225 --> 01:22:03.266
MARISHA: Oh, okay, okay. That's fine.

01:22:03.266 --> 01:22:05.800
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.826
back up into the far corner in the very back.

01:22:08.826 --> 01:22:10.487
MATT: Over here?
LIAM: Into the fart corner.

01:22:10.487 --> 01:22:12.295
TALIESIN: Yeah. That way.
LAURA: "Into the fart corner."

01:22:12.295 --> 01:22:14.076
MARISHA: That's the hallway.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:22:14.076 --> 01:22:16.564
MATT: You got it.
ASHLEY: I rolled a 23.

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:17.535
MATT: 23?

01:22:17.535 --> 01:22:19.107
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:22:19.107 --> 01:22:20.073
MATT: (creaking)

01:22:20.073 --> 01:22:20.906
Tink!

01:22:20.906 --> 01:22:21.821
(gasping)

01:22:21.821 --> 01:22:24.018
It begins to plummet.

01:22:24.018 --> 01:22:24.929
LIAM: (whooshing)

01:22:24.929 --> 01:22:27.426
MATT: (grasping) The claw catches it underneath,

01:22:27.426 --> 01:22:29.866
about six or seven feet off the ground.

01:22:29.866 --> 01:22:32.479
And now it's holding the threshold crest in its grip.

01:22:32.479 --> 01:22:34.221
LAURA: How big is the threshold crest?

01:22:34.221 --> 01:22:36.837
MATT: It's about two and a half feet
across from side to side.

01:22:36.837 --> 01:22:39.767
It's a large shape. It's heavy.

01:22:39.767 --> 01:22:42.452
LAURA: That won't fit into a Bag of Holding, would it?

01:22:42.452 --> 01:22:43.449
MATT: Likely not.

01:22:43.449 --> 01:22:44.954
It won't even fit through the opening.

01:22:44.954 --> 01:22:47.154
You'd have to carry it with you.

01:22:50.671 --> 01:22:52.274
MARISHA: Can we get out of here?

01:22:52.274 --> 01:22:53.632
LAURA: Yeah. Let's make for the doors.

01:22:53.632 --> 01:22:55.095
MATT: Right about now is when it would fade.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:57.108
You guys have taken some time here to set up,

01:22:57.108 --> 01:22:58.015
cast spells.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.615
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: Arrange,

01:22:59.615 --> 01:23:00.849
to wedge that free, pull it down,

01:23:00.849 --> 01:23:03.311
have a conversation, plan what's going to happen.

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.230
We'll say right about now

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.117
is when it returns.

01:23:06.117 --> 01:23:08.458
LIAM: All right. I would have floated it back by Caleb,

01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:10.554
I would say, since it caught it by the ground.

01:23:10.554 --> 01:23:12.075
MATT: Okay. So it's now on the ground over here?

01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:13.467
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:23:13.467 --> 01:23:15.373
LIAM: With the basketball in its hand.

01:23:15.373 --> 01:23:20.373
MATT: (heavy impact) It appears right there where it was.

01:23:20.399 --> 01:23:22.443
Beauregard is right there in front of it.

01:23:22.443 --> 01:23:24.076
MARISHA: Holding my action.
TALIESIN: Did it hit the banana?

01:23:24.076 --> 01:23:25.712
Well, yeah, because it hasn't moved yet.
So it would've hit--

01:23:25.712 --> 01:23:27.270
MATT: It hasn't moved yet. And it doesn't have to move

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:28.578
because Beauregard is right there.

01:23:28.578 --> 01:23:31.625
SAM: It doesn't get frozen in mid-stride? No, I guess--

01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:32.762
MATT: Well, no, it's not frozen in time.

01:23:32.762 --> 01:23:35.337
It gets banished elsewhere and gets confused

01:23:35.337 --> 01:23:37.232
and tries to figure out where it is.

01:23:37.232 --> 01:23:39.064
And then it re-emerges.

01:23:39.064 --> 01:23:41.993
Yeah. It's not, it does not, a locked point in time.

01:23:41.993 --> 01:23:43.592
TRAVIS: It's not questioning its existence,

01:23:43.592 --> 01:23:44.663
having been banished twice in a row?

01:23:44.663 --> 01:23:46.503
LAURA: I know. It's probably so confused.

01:23:46.503 --> 01:23:49.400
MATT: It is a being often, you can see,

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.772
drawn towards having extensive, internal existential crises.

01:23:53.772 --> 01:23:55.341
(laughter)

01:23:55.341 --> 01:23:59.345
No, it's an automaton designed to guard a space.

01:23:59.345 --> 01:24:00.178
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:24:00.178 --> 01:24:02.331
MATT: But now with you there,

01:24:02.331 --> 01:24:03.680
it does get its ability back,

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:04.513
but it's not going to use that.

01:24:04.513 --> 01:24:05.902
Instead, it's going to attempt to slam

01:24:05.902 --> 01:24:07.372
and hit you with its bladed lance.

01:24:07.372 --> 01:24:08.606
TRAVIS: Beau, watch out!
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait!

01:24:08.606 --> 01:24:09.806
Wasn't Beau holding an action?

01:24:09.806 --> 01:24:10.837
MARISHA: Yeah, I had held an action.
MATT: Yep. You do, so you go first.

01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:12.095
SAM: So was I.

01:24:12.095 --> 01:24:14.391
MATT: That's right. Go for it.

01:24:14.391 --> 01:24:15.224
MARISHA: Pop pop.

01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:19.301
Oh! Oh, yeah, okay. 25.
SAM: One.

01:24:19.301 --> 01:24:20.945
MARISHA: Sorry. 27 total.

01:24:21.967 --> 01:24:23.031
MATT: 27 hits.
MARISHA: On both of them.

01:24:23.031 --> 01:24:24.247
MATT: Yeah. Both hit.
MARISHA: I rolled two 15s.

01:24:24.247 --> 01:24:25.557
SAM: I'm hiding. Does that--

01:24:25.557 --> 01:24:26.786
MATT: You have advantage if you're hiding, yeah.

01:24:26.786 --> 01:24:27.922
SAM: Okay. Thank god.

01:24:27.922 --> 01:24:29.639
Much better. 27.

01:24:29.639 --> 01:24:30.472
MATT: That hits.

01:24:30.472 --> 01:24:32.082
SAM: Yeah!

01:24:32.082 --> 01:24:32.915
MARISHA: Okay.

01:24:33.946 --> 01:24:35.187
Fine.

01:24:36.941 --> 01:24:38.407
13 damage on the first one.

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:39.526
MATT: All righty.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:43.704
MARISHA: And 11 damage on the second.

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:44.771
MATT: You got it.

01:24:48.885 --> 01:24:52.310
SAM: (whispering) 28. 34.

01:24:54.123 --> 01:24:58.473
34 points of damage.

01:24:58.473 --> 01:24:59.351
MATT: Nice.

01:24:59.351 --> 01:25:01.076
All right. So. (impacting)

01:25:01.076 --> 01:25:03.724
It takes all these impacts as soon as it reappears.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:06.269
It's currently running in an opposite direction,

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:07.762
trying to figure out where it was.

01:25:07.762 --> 01:25:10.528
From the impact, turns its head back towards you.

01:25:10.528 --> 01:25:12.946
Its whole body shifts in your direction, Beauregard.

01:25:12.946 --> 01:25:14.881
You see the sparks jettisoning

01:25:14.881 --> 01:25:16.978
from various damage it's taken on its body.

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:19.539
You see one of his knees is busted,

01:25:19.539 --> 01:25:21.023
now that you're this much closer to it.

01:25:21.023 --> 01:25:22.722
And it's just moving itself forward

01:25:22.722 --> 01:25:24.865
as it takes one giant swing towards you

01:25:24.865 --> 01:25:26.795
with its bladed lance to try and pierce it down

01:25:26.795 --> 01:25:30.244
into you from on top, like a giant hypodermic needle.

01:25:30.244 --> 01:25:31.695
SAM: Matt, sorry.
LAURA: Dodge it!

01:25:31.695 --> 01:25:32.805
SAM: I did wrong math.

01:25:32.805 --> 01:25:33.878
It's 40 points of damage.

01:25:33.878 --> 01:25:35.102
MATT: Got it, 40. Okay.

01:25:35.102 --> 01:25:36.078
TRAVIS: Four-zero?
SAM: Four-zero.

01:25:36.078 --> 01:25:37.194
LAURA: Beau, dodge it.

01:25:37.194 --> 01:25:38.911
MARISHA: I'll try.

01:25:38.911 --> 01:25:41.753
MATT: That is going to be a 23 to hit.

01:25:41.753 --> 01:25:43.094
MARISHA: Jeez, it hits.

01:25:43.094 --> 01:25:45.190
MATT: And the slam against you is going to be

01:25:45.190 --> 01:25:46.540
a natural 19.

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.373
MARISHA: Miss,

01:25:47.373 --> 01:25:49.098
oh, natural 19.

01:25:49.098 --> 01:25:51.613
MATT: Yeah. So it'd be 31.

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:53.673
SAM: Did it have to move to get to her?

01:25:53.673 --> 01:25:55.760
MATT: It did not because she was right where it--
SAM: Goddamn it, Beau!

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:58.343
MARISHA: I thought-- I was trying.

01:25:58.343 --> 01:25:59.402
I was trying.

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:04.697
SAM: The camera like, zooms in on its foot.

01:26:04.697 --> 01:26:06.217
MATT: It's, like, right there.

01:26:06.217 --> 01:26:08.634
(laughter)

01:26:09.686 --> 01:26:12.211
LIAM: (as Veth) Come on, you son of a bitch.
MATT: You take 33 points of piercing damage.

01:26:12.211 --> 01:26:13.780
SAM: Just step forward, motherfucker.

01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:14.613
MARISHA: 33.

01:26:14.613 --> 01:26:16.043
MATT: Yep. And you are grappled.

01:26:16.043 --> 01:26:17.406
LAURA: And grappled.
TALIESIN: No, you're not.

01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:20.650
MARISHA: Well, I can use
five feet of movement to be un-grappled.

01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:22.387
MATT: Correct. So you are grappled.

01:26:22.387 --> 01:26:24.619
You are pierced as it goes through your shoulder

01:26:24.619 --> 01:26:26.290
and comes out of the back of your shoulder blade.

01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:27.204
MARISHA: (groans)

01:26:27.204 --> 01:26:29.254
TRAVIS: Sucks, right?
MARISHA: Yeah, it really sucks.

01:26:29.254 --> 01:26:30.994
MATT: But you already know it missed everything vital,

01:26:30.994 --> 01:26:32.978
and there is a way that you could probably

01:26:32.978 --> 01:26:36.425
arrange your bones and muscle and shift

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:37.702
to maneuver you out, not too hard.

01:26:37.702 --> 01:26:39.350
MARISHA: Yeah. It's not my spleen, but it hurts.

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:41.098
LIAM: She never uses those muscles.

01:26:41.098 --> 01:26:42.906
MATT: Never, never, never.

01:26:44.547 --> 01:26:45.380
LIAM: (deflating sound)

01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:47.971
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah.

01:26:47.971 --> 01:26:49.487
LIAM: Pop pop?

01:26:49.487 --> 01:26:51.131
Fuh fuh?

01:26:51.131 --> 01:26:52.318
MATT: The slam attack does--

01:26:52.318 --> 01:26:53.876
MARISHA: It's okay. They're insured.

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:55.383
(laughter)

01:26:55.383 --> 01:26:58.129
MATT: 24 points of bludgeoning damage.
As you're reacting to that--

01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:59.572
MARISHA: How many? How many?

01:26:59.572 --> 01:27:01.218
MATT: Because it does have advantage against you

01:27:01.218 --> 01:27:02.103
after you've been grappled by it.

01:27:02.103 --> 01:27:03.925
So like, it basically pulls you up

01:27:03.925 --> 01:27:05.675
and then just slams you

01:27:05.675 --> 01:27:07.039
as you're on the edge of its lance.

01:27:07.039 --> 01:27:08.105
MARISHA: So 22?

01:27:08.105 --> 01:27:09.611
MATT: 22, yeah.

01:27:09.611 --> 01:27:11.702
TRAVIS: 50.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.729
Yikes!
LAURA: Wow. Don't let him catch you.

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:17.630
MARISHA: Took me down by half.
LAURA: He does some serious damage.

01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:18.580
MATT: All righty. So.

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:19.663
TALIESIN: Two attacks and you're out.

01:27:19.663 --> 01:27:22.155
MATT: That finishes its turn.

01:27:22.155 --> 01:27:23.348
Veth, you're up.

01:27:23.348 --> 01:27:26.566
SAM: Oh, me? Oh shit, I just threw my knife.

01:27:26.566 --> 01:27:29.289
(laughter)

01:27:29.289 --> 01:27:31.839
And he probably knows where I am.

01:27:31.839 --> 01:27:33.069
MATT: Yeah.

01:27:33.069 --> 01:27:36.042
LAURA: But he's next to a friend, so yeah.

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:38.399
SAM: Oh yeah, that's right. You're engaged.

01:27:38.399 --> 01:27:43.374
I'll just sort of rock around the thingy-thing.

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.584
Yeah, just around to the other side of it.

01:27:46.584 --> 01:27:48.525
And I will-- (cocks crossbow)

01:27:48.525 --> 01:27:50.643
I'll fire my--
MATT: You got it.

01:27:50.643 --> 01:27:53.403
SAM: My Tinkertop Boltblaster.

01:27:53.403 --> 01:27:54.803
See if I can hit.

01:27:55.806 --> 01:27:57.298
Natural 20!

01:27:57.298 --> 01:27:58.875
TRAVIS: Let's go!

01:27:58.875 --> 01:28:01.566
(cheering)

01:28:01.566 --> 01:28:02.596
MARISHA: (air horn)

01:28:02.596 --> 01:28:06.149
SAM: Plus sneak attack because it's engaged with Beau?

01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:08.659
MATT: Yes, it would. Yeah. It's a critical sneak attack.

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:11.953
TRAVIS: Let's go, rogue shit.
LAURA: Come on. All sixes. All sixes.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.986
SAM: The boltblaster.
LIAM: Is it a magical bolt?

01:28:13.986 --> 01:28:16.280
SAM: I don't know. It is a magical weapon for sure.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.080
MATT: Yeah. You get a secondary attack after this

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.190
because you rolled a natural 20.

01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:21.814
SAM: But no-- is it a magic one?

01:28:21.814 --> 01:28:24.117
MATT: What's that? No, it's not magical weapon.

01:28:24.117 --> 01:28:27.615
It's spells and effects that are like, casting magic.

01:28:27.615 --> 01:28:29.482
LAURA: You really want it.
LIAM: But what if it was?

01:28:30.782 --> 01:28:32.165
It'll be me.
TALIESIN: Liam.

01:28:32.165 --> 01:28:33.521
LIAM: It'll warp me away.

01:28:33.521 --> 01:28:34.545
MATT: (chuckles)

01:28:34.545 --> 01:28:36.457
SAM: (whispering) Plus six is

01:28:36.457 --> 01:28:37.565
42.

01:28:39.307 --> 01:28:40.355
But it's--

01:28:40.355 --> 01:28:41.407
LAURA: Doubled?

01:28:41.407 --> 01:28:44.000
SAM: Well, I mean it's a natural 20.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:44.916
So is that doubled?

01:28:44.916 --> 01:28:46.586
MATT: Double the dice.

01:28:46.586 --> 01:28:48.806
LIAM: And then add your bonuses.

01:28:48.806 --> 01:28:52.718
SAM: Doubling the dice would make it an extra 36.

01:28:52.718 --> 01:28:53.592
MARISHA: Whoa.

01:28:53.592 --> 01:28:56.134
SAM: That's 78. Right?

01:28:56.134 --> 01:28:57.459
LIAM: (whispers) Rogue.

01:28:59.246 --> 01:29:01.217
LAURA: And that's just the first attack?

01:29:02.475 --> 01:29:05.275
MATT: So as you fire this one bolt, you see

01:29:05.275 --> 01:29:09.401
now it has Beau dangling from this lance in its arm.

01:29:09.401 --> 01:29:10.942
And it just like, slams into her once,

01:29:10.942 --> 01:29:12.163
her body goes limp for a second.

01:29:12.163 --> 01:29:13.368
The limbs just fall back.

01:29:13.368 --> 01:29:15.056
She tenses to grab the edge.

01:29:15.056 --> 01:29:16.084
She pulls back the fist again.

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:17.476
And you can see the red beam from

01:29:17.476 --> 01:29:20.301
its one central gem eye focused on her.

01:29:20.301 --> 01:29:22.401
As it pulls back, you fire up and see this opening

01:29:22.401 --> 01:29:23.842
in its armor where the sparks are coming from it.

01:29:23.842 --> 01:29:26.334
As you fire, it sinks in.

01:29:26.334 --> 01:29:27.972
And at first, it's like it didn't hit anything.

01:29:27.972 --> 01:29:29.765
And suddenly (spraying)

01:29:29.765 --> 01:29:31.846
sparks go flying out of it.

01:29:31.846 --> 01:29:32.938
You see its body--

01:29:32.938 --> 01:29:34.230
(electrical crackling)

01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:36.491
It's still holding her, but it's <i>hurt</i>.

01:29:36.491 --> 01:29:38.919
It's having a rough time holding together.

01:29:38.919 --> 01:29:41.799
SAM: Because it was a 20, it automatically fires again.

01:29:41.799 --> 01:29:43.146
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:29:43.146 --> 01:29:44.496
SAM: Ooh, that's no good.

01:29:44.496 --> 01:29:46.288
TALIESIN: You got a d4, add it to that.

01:29:46.288 --> 01:29:48.416
SAM: Now I do. It's still no good.

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:50.066
Nine plus 11. 20.

01:29:50.066 --> 01:29:50.899
MATT: 20 does not hit him.

01:29:50.899 --> 01:29:53.169
SAM: But I also have a bonus action to shoot again!

01:29:53.169 --> 01:29:54.594
MATT: You do.
LAURA: Yeah!

01:29:54.594 --> 01:29:56.006
SAM: Natural one.

01:29:56.006 --> 01:29:56.934
(laughter)

01:29:56.934 --> 01:29:58.852
That means it hits me!
MATT: Yep!

01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:00.282
(laughter)

01:30:00.282 --> 01:30:02.109
TALIESIN: Battle [inaudible] things.

01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:04.109
MATT: That was a rollercoaster of a round!

01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:05.201
(laughter)

01:30:05.201 --> 01:30:07.343
TRAVIS: (shoots) Yes! (shoots, screams)

01:30:07.343 --> 01:30:10.405
(laughter)

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:12.891
SAM: It gives me five points of damage.

01:30:12.891 --> 01:30:14.285
TALIESIN: End the game. End the game.

01:30:14.285 --> 01:30:15.368
MATT: All righty.

01:30:16.391 --> 01:30:18.465
SAM: Yeah, I fire once. I fire twice.

01:30:18.465 --> 01:30:21.425
It didn't work so then I'm like: What the--?! (screams)

01:30:21.425 --> 01:30:23.875
(laughter)

01:30:23.875 --> 01:30:25.568
MATT: All righty. As Veth is like (yelps)

01:30:25.568 --> 01:30:27.108
cursing on the side from the pain.

01:30:27.108 --> 01:30:28.585
We move to...

01:30:28.585 --> 01:30:29.454
Yasha.

01:30:29.454 --> 01:30:30.399
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:30:30.399 --> 01:30:33.841
So can I try to float over to--

01:30:35.193 --> 01:30:37.198
TRAVIS: Please breast stroke over.

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.315
ASHLEY: Over to him?

01:30:38.315 --> 01:30:40.180
MATT: So what you do know right now

01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:43.342
is that you cannot control the direction of this at all.

01:30:43.342 --> 01:30:44.834
Only Veth can.

01:30:46.144 --> 01:30:46.980
ASHLEY: Veth!

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:47.813
MATT: However--

01:30:47.813 --> 01:30:51.095
SAM: Also, I can only go up and down.
MATT: Can only control up and down.

01:30:51.095 --> 01:30:52.904
If you want to try and grab a hold of the ceiling

01:30:52.904 --> 01:30:54.746
and pull yourself along like an astronaut,

01:30:54.746 --> 01:30:55.789
you could try that.

01:30:55.789 --> 01:30:58.048
ASHLEY: Would that be considered an action?

01:30:58.048 --> 01:30:59.152
MATT: That would be your movement.

01:30:59.152 --> 01:31:00.489
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, let's do it.
MATT: All right.

01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:01.406
ASHLEY: Because I want to get over the--

01:31:01.406 --> 01:31:04.203
MATT: So you see you reach up and
grab the edge and begin grabbing

01:31:04.203 --> 01:31:07.254
some of the lip of where you just carved
out the threshold crest from and

01:31:07.254 --> 01:31:09.006
give yourself a shove, and you just (whooshing)--

01:31:09.006 --> 01:31:11.065
TRAVIS: Space walk that shit.
MATT: Drift for 20 feet.

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:11.898
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:31:13.684 --> 01:31:14.532
MATT: Three, four.

01:31:14.532 --> 01:31:16.245
That gets you about there.

01:31:16.245 --> 01:31:17.728
SAM: Come on, Sandy Bullock.

01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:18.787
MATT: But you're not quite there yet.

01:31:18.787 --> 01:31:20.664
You could use another action to--

01:31:20.664 --> 01:31:22.502
or you can use your action to move further.

01:31:22.502 --> 01:31:24.325
You're not quite close enough to get to it.

01:31:24.325 --> 01:31:27.051
At this point, unfortunately,
the levitation is not helping you.

01:31:27.051 --> 01:31:28.111
ASHLEY: No, not at all.

01:31:28.986 --> 01:31:31.529
So if I--
(laughter)

01:31:31.529 --> 01:31:34.046
SAM: Well, what do you want me to do? Drop you?

01:31:37.794 --> 01:31:40.107
ASHLEY: But then-- okay, so I'll--

01:31:40.107 --> 01:31:41.112
but if I try to get over there,

01:31:41.112 --> 01:31:45.051
then I can't attack him because that's the-- fuck!

01:31:45.051 --> 01:31:45.952
Okay. Um, um--

01:31:45.952 --> 01:31:48.331
SAM: Do you want me to drop you?

01:31:48.331 --> 01:31:50.397
ASHLEY: Yes! Drop me, drop me.

01:31:50.397 --> 01:31:51.717
But that's-- I'm still not going to be--

01:31:51.717 --> 01:31:53.143
Yeah. Drop me.

01:31:53.143 --> 01:31:54.375
SAM: Drop.

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:55.873
MATT: All right. You fall 30 feet.

01:31:55.873 --> 01:31:58.740
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:00.824
MATT: (theater yells) Onto the ground.

01:32:00.824 --> 01:32:02.931
LAURA: But you're raging still?
TALIESIN: Now you're raging still.

01:32:02.931 --> 01:32:03.764
ASHLEY: Yeah?
MATT: Yeah.

01:32:03.764 --> 01:32:05.577
LAURA: So you're, at least that's resistance--

01:32:05.577 --> 01:32:08.380
MATT: So it would be seven points of
bludgeoning damage reduced to three.

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.213
ASHLEY: Okay. That's fine.

01:32:09.213 --> 01:32:10.855
MATT: You are prone.
ASHLEY: Worth it.

01:32:14.553 --> 01:32:15.751
I'll stand up.

01:32:15.751 --> 01:32:16.584
MATT: Okay.

01:32:16.584 --> 01:32:17.430
(laughter)

01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:20.405
TALIESIN: You could probably get a little ways over there.

01:32:20.405 --> 01:32:22.584
MATT: So--
ASHLEY: What a turn!

01:32:23.295 --> 01:32:25.145
MATT: What's your movement?

01:32:25.145 --> 01:32:26.275
ASHLEY: 50 feet.
MATT: 50 feet.

01:32:26.275 --> 01:32:28.424
You have five feet of movement.

01:32:28.424 --> 01:32:29.275
ASHLEY: I'll stand up.

01:32:29.275 --> 01:32:30.254
Oh, am I standing up?

01:32:30.254 --> 01:32:31.735
MATT: Well, it takes half your movement to get up--

01:32:31.735 --> 01:32:33.195
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: -- we'll say, so it's 25,

01:32:33.195 --> 01:32:36.055
and you moved 20 feet across the ceiling

01:32:36.055 --> 01:32:38.115
by just floating and pulling yourself along,

01:32:38.115 --> 01:32:39.245
so you have five feet of movement.

01:32:39.245 --> 01:32:40.528
ASHLEY: Got it, okay, so--

01:32:40.528 --> 01:32:42.394
TALIESIN: It was burning an action, too.

01:32:42.394 --> 01:32:44.035
LAURA: Yeah.

01:32:44.035 --> 01:32:45.155
MATT: You haven't burned an action yet.

01:32:45.155 --> 01:32:46.753
LAURA: Oh, that was just movement.
MATT: She had that option.

01:32:46.753 --> 01:32:49.167
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, so you haven't-- oh, never mind me, oh.

01:32:49.167 --> 01:32:53.285
ASHLEY: But I can't do anything,
because I'm a up close, you know?

01:32:53.285 --> 01:32:54.118
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately.

01:32:54.118 --> 01:32:55.710
TRAVIS: Throw the sword.
SAM: Do you have anything to throw?

01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:57.995
ASHLEY: I'll throw the sword.

01:32:57.995 --> 01:32:59.995
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: Sure.

01:32:59.995 --> 01:33:01.545
Make an attack roll with disadvantage.

01:33:01.545 --> 01:33:03.355
LAURA: Straight into the sparking part.

01:33:03.355 --> 01:33:06.238
MATT: And with your angle it does have half cover, so.

01:33:06.238 --> 01:33:08.035
ASHLEY: Ooh, okay, that's not bad.

01:33:08.035 --> 01:33:10.509
MARISHA: Beau's like, oh thank god, Yasha's just-- no!

01:33:10.509 --> 01:33:11.435
ASHLEY: Disadvantage you said?
MATT: Yeah.

01:33:11.435 --> 01:33:12.446
ASHLEY: A natural one.

01:33:12.446 --> 01:33:15.190
(laughter)

01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:17.465
MATT: Okay, Beauregard...

01:33:17.465 --> 01:33:20.940
MARISHA: (high pitched sounds) I was joking!

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:23.925
MATT: Beauregard, I would like you

01:33:23.925 --> 01:33:25.555
to just make a dexterity saving throw for me, please.

01:33:25.555 --> 01:33:28.940
ASHLEY: Oh my god, if I stab you again.

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.265
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:33:30.265 --> 01:33:32.211
SAM: Don't you guys have a date tomorrow?

01:33:32.211 --> 01:33:34.069
TRAVIS: Honey? Honey?

01:33:34.069 --> 01:33:35.711
MARISHA: Oh, I don't have the d4.

01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:36.843
You didn't get me.

01:33:36.843 --> 01:33:39.342
ASHLEY: Oh, do I have a d4!?

01:33:39.342 --> 01:33:41.285
But wait, I rolled a natural one.
MATT: It's still a natural one.

01:33:41.285 --> 01:33:43.272
MARISHA: 19.
MATT: 19.

01:33:43.272 --> 01:33:44.555
You, out of the corner of your eye,

01:33:44.555 --> 01:33:47.255
see Yasha throwing this blade and there's this moment,

01:33:48.753 --> 01:33:50.775
where you're like, this is uncomfortable,

01:33:50.775 --> 01:33:52.888
and you just twist back a little bit

01:33:52.888 --> 01:33:55.835
and it sheers of the metal right in front of you.

01:33:55.835 --> 01:33:57.658
Unfortunately, it does not impact--

01:33:57.658 --> 01:34:00.967
MARISHA: Anything.
MATT: Anything. (laughs)

01:34:00.967 --> 01:34:01.908
And what did you throw?

01:34:01.908 --> 01:34:02.805
Did you throw Magician's Judge

01:34:02.805 --> 01:34:04.125
because that was the one that was out?

01:34:04.125 --> 01:34:05.035
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay,

01:34:05.035 --> 01:34:07.185
so you do not have Magician's Judge at the moment.

01:34:07.185 --> 01:34:08.604
It is somewhere over here against the wall.

01:34:08.604 --> 01:34:10.725
(laughter)

01:34:10.725 --> 01:34:11.783
ASHLEY: All of the dumb decisions.

01:34:11.783 --> 01:34:13.225
MATT: It was a worthy endeavor.

01:34:13.225 --> 01:34:15.795
ASHLEY: I'm just like, I have butterflies in my stomach,

01:34:15.795 --> 01:34:17.885
I don't want to fight anymore.

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:20.343
I'm going to have a date soon. She might die.

01:34:20.343 --> 01:34:23.010
MATT: It is a lot to concentrate on.
MARISHA: My knight in shining armor,

01:34:23.010 --> 01:34:24.493
she's here to save me-- oh god!

01:34:24.493 --> 01:34:27.515
(laughter)

01:34:27.515 --> 01:34:29.465
MATT: My god, all right
TALIESIN: Reschedule your date.

01:34:29.465 --> 01:34:30.915
ASHLEY: I just scream out in rage.

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:31.748
MATT: There you go.

01:34:32.745 --> 01:34:33.578
TRAVIS: That's rage-worthy.

01:34:33.578 --> 01:34:36.239
MATT: That definitely maintains the rage, no issue.

01:34:36.239 --> 01:34:37.795
ASHLEY: Fuck!
MATT: That was pretty cool,

01:34:37.795 --> 01:34:40.325
to be like (sword whooshing). Just--

01:34:40.325 --> 01:34:43.015
TALIESIN: Clank, clank.
MATT: -- not a very learned

01:34:43.015 --> 01:34:44.795
or experienced form an attack.

01:34:44.795 --> 01:34:46.465
(laughter)

01:34:46.465 --> 01:34:47.595
MATT: Fjord, you're up. Beau, you're on deck.

01:34:47.595 --> 01:34:49.115
TRAVIS: Oh shit, I'm up.

01:34:50.278 --> 01:34:51.525
God, I'm down at the bottom.

01:34:51.525 --> 01:34:56.093
Yeah, I'll fire three more Eldritch Blasts at this POS.

01:34:56.093 --> 01:34:59.755
♪ Eldritch Blast ♪ in the face, hiyah! ♪

01:35:00.825 --> 01:35:02.183
Bless still up? It's not, right?

01:35:02.183 --> 01:35:03.528
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:35:03.528 --> 01:35:04.602
LIAM: ♪ Eldritch take the wheel. ♪

01:35:04.602 --> 01:35:06.025
TRAVIS: Oh, I finally had cast,

01:35:06.025 --> 01:35:09.155
but that's 19 plus ten-- it's a 19 to hit,

01:35:09.155 --> 01:35:11.255
or 29 to hit, sorry.
MATT: 29 hits.

01:35:11.255 --> 01:35:14.403
TRAVIS: Second one, that's a natural one,

01:35:14.403 --> 01:35:17.485
and third one, is 26, plus--

01:35:17.485 --> 01:35:18.318
LAURA: A natural one.

01:35:18.318 --> 01:35:20.002
MATT: Yep, on a spell.
TRAVIS: 29.

01:35:20.002 --> 01:35:20.835
MATT: So two hit.

01:35:20.835 --> 01:35:22.258
Roll damage twice.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:25.645
MATT: And also roll a 100 dice too.
TALIESIN: Did you add the d4?

01:35:25.645 --> 01:35:26.575
Or does it matter?

01:35:26.575 --> 01:35:28.165
MATT: It doesn't matter.
TALIESIN: Yeah, brain.

01:35:28.165 --> 01:35:30.595
TRAVIS: Should I do the 100 dice first?

01:35:30.595 --> 01:35:32.515
MATT: Yeah, why not?
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. Okay.

01:35:32.515 --> 01:35:33.505
Hold on, I have this.

01:35:33.505 --> 01:35:35.238
LIAM: Just only ever butterflies.

01:35:35.238 --> 01:35:36.710
MARISHA: 65, 65, 65, 65!
LAURA: If it's 65,

01:35:36.710 --> 01:35:38.637
I'm going to be so impressed

01:35:38.637 --> 01:35:40.353
TRAVIS: 77.

01:35:40.353 --> 01:35:42.311
MATT: 77, okay.

01:35:43.302 --> 01:35:47.052
LIAM: ♪ Back in the summer of '65. ♪

01:35:48.235 --> 01:35:50.261
MATT: In your childhood--
SAM: Oh no.

01:35:50.261 --> 01:35:53.785
MATT: What is a smell that would
remind Fjord of his childhood?

01:35:53.785 --> 01:35:55.335
TRAVIS: Salt of the sea.

01:35:55.335 --> 01:35:56.285
MATT: For some odd reason,

01:35:56.285 --> 01:35:58.085
the air in the chamber surrounding this creature

01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:01.325
begins to smell like a fresh shoreline.

01:36:01.325 --> 01:36:04.335
It's like Port Damali's seaside.

01:36:04.335 --> 01:36:06.035
You begin to have sense memory

01:36:06.035 --> 01:36:07.165
of growing up along the beach,

01:36:07.165 --> 01:36:10.543
of doing medial chores and looking out upon the horizon,

01:36:10.543 --> 01:36:13.125
and just knowing the possibility for adventure.

01:36:13.125 --> 01:36:15.465
It's a very strong smell. It's like you're right there.

01:36:15.465 --> 01:36:18.075
Do your damage.
SAM: That's it?

01:36:18.075 --> 01:36:20.165
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: (laughs)

01:36:20.165 --> 01:36:20.998
LAURA: I love it.

01:36:20.998 --> 01:36:22.287
TALIESIN: Did anyone else think he was going to summon

01:36:22.287 --> 01:36:23.575
the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man?

01:36:23.575 --> 01:36:25.565
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36:25.565 --> 01:36:27.871
TRAVIS: 22 points of force damage.

01:36:27.871 --> 01:36:29.090
MATT: 22 points of force damage.
TRAVIS: That's it.

01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:30.765
TALIESIN: Teleport into another dimension.

01:36:30.765 --> 01:36:32.555
TRAVIS: And I will use my movement

01:36:32.555 --> 01:36:36.605
to just move further back towards that alcove back here.

01:36:36.605 --> 01:36:37.958
MATT: Over here? You got it.

01:36:39.265 --> 01:36:40.735
All right, that finishes your go, Fjord.

01:36:40.735 --> 01:36:42.835
Beau, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

01:36:44.135 --> 01:36:48.375
MARISHA: Okay, I'm just going to
stay gripped onto this thing.

01:36:48.375 --> 01:36:50.095
I'm actually going to do some sort of metal shit,

01:36:50.095 --> 01:36:50.928
I'm going to grab it

01:36:50.928 --> 01:36:53.475
and I'm just going to pull myself in even further,

01:36:53.475 --> 01:36:56.635
and I'm just going to go for that open spot

01:36:56.635 --> 01:36:58.475
that Veth already made,

01:36:58.475 --> 01:37:00.115
and I'm just going to take my bare fist

01:37:00.115 --> 01:37:01.497
and just start slamming it--

01:37:01.497 --> 01:37:02.913
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: -- right into--

01:37:02.913 --> 01:37:04.958
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.
MATT: Two attacks on it.

01:37:04.958 --> 01:37:08.905
MARISHA: Pop. Geez, Louise.

01:37:08.905 --> 01:37:11.600
24?
MATT: 24 hits.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.195
MARISHA: And I don't think this one will.

01:37:13.195 --> 01:37:16.675
I know this one will-- oh, I don't know, nope.

01:37:16.675 --> 01:37:18.255
20 total.
MATT: Nope.

01:37:18.255 --> 01:37:19.255
First one hits.

01:37:19.255 --> 01:37:20.222
MARISHA: First one hits.

01:37:20.222 --> 01:37:21.665
LAURA: Come on, big money.

01:37:21.665 --> 01:37:22.565
MATT: You're just being jostled around

01:37:22.565 --> 01:37:24.882
on the edge of its giant big piercing arm.

01:37:24.882 --> 01:37:26.585
MARISHA: Oh no, oh, that's a seven.

01:37:26.585 --> 01:37:28.928
Okay, okay, okay.

01:37:28.928 --> 01:37:31.985
LIAM: Hit the off button.
MARISHA: 14?

01:37:31.985 --> 01:37:35.082
MATT: 14, all righty, that does damage.

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:36.095
MARISHA: That does damage?

01:37:36.095 --> 01:37:36.969
Flurry of Blows.

01:37:36.969 --> 01:37:38.505
MATT: Go for it.

01:37:38.505 --> 01:37:40.095
LAURA: (laughs)

01:37:40.095 --> 01:37:45.095
MARISHA: Lord, one's a two and one's a 16, so...

01:37:45.528 --> 01:37:46.420
28?

01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.822
MATT: 28 hits, so one of them hits.

01:37:47.822 --> 01:37:50.897
MARISHA: Come on, you motherfucker.

01:37:50.897 --> 01:37:51.988
10 damage.

01:37:51.988 --> 01:37:53.185
MATT: 10 damage, all righty.

01:37:55.005 --> 01:37:56.755
You do have Extract Aspects, though.

01:37:56.755 --> 01:37:59.468
MARISHA: Extract Aspects, I guess.

01:37:59.468 --> 01:38:01.785
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:38:01.785 --> 01:38:03.728
MATT: It is resistant to fire and ice.

01:38:03.728 --> 01:38:05.136
MARISHA: Okay.

01:38:05.136 --> 01:38:06.575
MATT: It's immune to poison and psychic,

01:38:06.575 --> 01:38:10.105
and bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from
non-magical weapons that aren't adamantine.

01:38:10.105 --> 01:38:11.647
It is vulnerable to lightning.

01:38:11.647 --> 01:38:12.480
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:14.235
SAM: To what?
LIAM: Vulnerable to lightning.

01:38:14.235 --> 01:38:15.582
MARISHA: Great to know now.

01:38:15.582 --> 01:38:17.735
SAM: Fuck, I specifically didn't add lightning

01:38:17.735 --> 01:38:18.702
to my shot.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:38:18.702 --> 01:38:20.405
MARISHA: I was afraid to add lightning,

01:38:20.405 --> 01:38:21.708
because I was afraid it might soup it up or something.

01:38:21.708 --> 01:38:22.897
SAM: It's got electricity on it.

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:23.955
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

01:38:23.955 --> 01:38:26.221
LIAM: Bet it overloads.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:38:26.221 --> 01:38:29.393
MATT: It's a damaged exposed automaton.

01:38:29.393 --> 01:38:32.488
LAURA: Mm-hmm, that makes sense.
LIAM: Sure, sure, sure.

01:38:33.575 --> 01:38:36.255
MARISHA: We should've been using lightning this whole time,

01:38:36.255 --> 01:38:41.255
I say as I'm losing blood at an exponential level.

01:38:41.735 --> 01:38:43.645
LAURA: You can use your movement to get off it.

01:38:43.645 --> 01:38:45.885
MARISHA: Oh yeah, I'll use my
movement to get off of it, then.

01:38:45.885 --> 01:38:48.745
MATT: All right, you pull yourself off of its arm,

01:38:48.745 --> 01:38:51.018
and you still have the rest of your
movement if you'd like to shift somewhere.

01:38:51.018 --> 01:38:53.475
MARISHA: I'm going to look at the banana peel

01:38:53.475 --> 01:38:55.630
that it's like six inches away from.

01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:57.075
SAM and MATT: (laugh)

01:38:57.075 --> 01:39:00.218
MARISHA: And I'm going to back up,
and I'm going to look at it,

01:39:00.218 --> 01:39:01.893
and I'm going to say,

01:39:01.893 --> 01:39:05.705
"I'm the one you're looking for"?

01:39:05.705 --> 01:39:07.965
MATT: How far back do you go?

01:39:07.965 --> 01:39:09.985
MARISHA: As far as I can into that corner, I guess.

01:39:09.985 --> 01:39:12.185
LAURA: Oh no, Beau-Beau!
MARISHA: I just want to lean it,

01:39:12.185 --> 01:39:13.455
not that far, not that far.

01:39:13.455 --> 01:39:14.565
I want it to come towards me.

01:39:14.565 --> 01:39:15.925
Split the difference.
MATT: There?

01:39:15.925 --> 01:39:19.495
MARISHA: Split, even less, even less, that's good.

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:21.682
SAM: You said as far back as I can go.

01:39:21.682 --> 01:39:23.705
MARISHA: That's good, that's good.
MATT: Okay.

01:39:23.705 --> 01:39:25.175
SAM: I meant two squares.

01:39:25.175 --> 01:39:26.343
MARISHA: One square back, one square back.

01:39:26.343 --> 01:39:27.576
MATT: One square back?

01:39:27.576 --> 01:39:28.825
Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good,

01:39:28.825 --> 01:39:30.696
that's good.
MATT: Confirmed, okay.

01:39:30.696 --> 01:39:31.529
It will use it will use its reaction

01:39:31.529 --> 01:39:32.735
to take an attack of opportunity against you

01:39:32.735 --> 01:39:35.055
as you move out of the range of its piercing arm.

01:39:35.055 --> 01:39:37.495
TRAVIS: If it fucking recaptures you.

01:39:37.495 --> 01:39:39.548
MATT: That is going to be...
MARISHA: Probably will.

01:39:42.427 --> 01:39:43.767
MATT: 24 to hit.

01:39:43.767 --> 01:39:45.803
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:39:45.803 --> 01:39:48.645
SAM: You've been Sentinel'ed.

01:39:48.645 --> 01:39:51.152
MATT: Sucks, don't it?
TRAVIS: Other shoulder. (groans)

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:56.043
(laughter)

01:39:58.345 --> 01:40:00.685
MATT: You take 39 points of piercing damage.

01:40:00.685 --> 01:40:02.255
LAURA: Oh my god, Beau,

01:40:02.255 --> 01:40:03.705
are you alive?
MATT: As you begin backing up,

01:40:03.705 --> 01:40:05.965
it just reaches out

01:40:05.965 --> 01:40:08.245
and pierces you right in the abdomen,

01:40:08.245 --> 01:40:09.505
poking out the backside,

01:40:09.505 --> 01:40:11.382
and as it pulls back, it (whooshing) into your back

01:40:11.382 --> 01:40:12.865
and the barb catches you,

01:40:12.865 --> 01:40:14.615
and you can feel yourself dragging your feet,

01:40:14.615 --> 01:40:15.785
grinding against the ground.

01:40:15.785 --> 01:40:18.145
MARISHA: I'm just like, "Oh, the banana, though!"

01:40:18.145 --> 01:40:20.095
MATT: But you can continue to use your movement

01:40:20.095 --> 01:40:21.445
to get off of it, if you want.

01:40:21.445 --> 01:40:22.285
MARISHA: I can?
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:40:22.285 --> 01:40:23.735
MATT: Because you still have more movement.

01:40:23.735 --> 01:40:27.225
MARISHA: Oh, then I will plant my feet into the stone

01:40:27.225 --> 01:40:29.355
and try and find a crevice and yank back.

01:40:29.355 --> 01:40:31.798
MATT: Okay, and you pull of of it without issue,

01:40:32.665 --> 01:40:35.475
managing to make another 10 feet of movement backwards.

01:40:35.475 --> 01:40:37.285
You are not grappled, you are fine.

01:40:37.285 --> 01:40:38.765
Well, fine, respectively.
MARISHA: Okay, good.

01:40:38.765 --> 01:40:40.418
I'm glad I didn't-- okay, great.

01:40:40.418 --> 01:40:43.288
TALIESIN: It's bad to move.
MARISHA: Great. Geez Louise.

01:40:43.288 --> 01:40:45.035
MATT: All right, that finishes Beau's turn,

01:40:45.035 --> 01:40:46.090
Caduceus, you're up.

01:40:46.090 --> 01:40:48.658
TALIESIN: I am-- this is not cool.

01:40:49.815 --> 01:40:50.905
Yeah, I was going to hit it,

01:40:50.905 --> 01:40:52.455
but I've decided I've got a better idea

01:40:52.455 --> 01:40:54.225
and I'm going to cast Heal on Beau.

01:40:54.225 --> 01:40:55.105
MARISHA: Thank you.
MATT: Okay.

01:40:55.105 --> 01:40:56.333
TALIESIN: 70 hit points up.

01:40:56.333 --> 01:40:57.648
(cheering)

01:40:57.648 --> 01:41:00.125
TRAVIS: That's fucking huge.
MATT: Cleric spells, man.

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:01.683
TALIESIN: You're about to get your ass kicked,

01:41:01.683 --> 01:41:05.263
so I didn't want to try and do a full Resurrect on you.

01:41:05.263 --> 01:41:08.755
MATT: Okay, now you going to move or you going to stay put?

01:41:08.755 --> 01:41:09.685
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay put.

01:41:09.685 --> 01:41:10.675
MATT: What's the range on Heal, by the way?

01:41:10.675 --> 01:41:12.265
TALIESIN: 60 feet.
MATT: 60 feet?

01:41:12.265 --> 01:41:13.545
Yeah, you get her in that, you're good.

01:41:13.545 --> 01:41:15.286
TALIESIN: I'll probably take a couple steps forward.

01:41:15.286 --> 01:41:17.861
Let me come forward.

01:41:17.861 --> 01:41:19.661
I want to-- even the-- like--

01:41:19.661 --> 01:41:22.205
not quite on the glowing disc, but like--

01:41:22.205 --> 01:41:23.725
MATT: There?
TALIESIN: A little closer

01:41:23.725 --> 01:41:25.025
to the glowing disc of doom.

01:41:25.025 --> 01:41:27.248
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah, there.

01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:28.695
MATT: What could possibly happen?

01:41:28.695 --> 01:41:30.105
All right, that finishes your go.

01:41:30.105 --> 01:41:33.305
Top of the round, we are Caleb. Jester, you're on deck.

01:41:33.305 --> 01:41:35.555
LIAM: Caleb just saw all of that madness play out,

01:41:35.555 --> 01:41:36.795
looks at his hand, looks at the jewel,

01:41:36.795 --> 01:41:38.065
looks at the claw, looks at the thing,

01:41:38.065 --> 01:41:40.815
and I'll just use my bonus action to whip--

01:41:40.815 --> 01:41:43.145
with the gem in its claw--

01:41:43.145 --> 01:41:46.099
and just punch the robot as hard as I can.

01:41:46.099 --> 01:41:47.585
MATT: How can far can it move?
LIAM: 60 feet.

01:41:47.585 --> 01:41:48.983
MATT: 60 feet, yeah, it can get there.

01:41:48.983 --> 01:41:49.816
(air whooshing)

01:41:49.816 --> 01:41:52.256
As it rushes over toward it.

01:41:55.054 --> 01:41:57.279
SAM: Robot punch!

01:41:57.279 --> 01:41:58.237
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:41:58.237 --> 01:42:00.155
(cheering)

01:42:00.155 --> 01:42:01.675
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

01:42:01.675 --> 01:42:03.322
SAM: Is it magic, is it magic?
LIAM: Yes, it is!

01:42:03.322 --> 01:42:05.045
MATT: Oh yeah.
LIAM: It's a magic claw.

01:42:05.045 --> 01:42:06.922
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d100 for me, please.

01:42:06.922 --> 01:42:08.061
LAURA: The claw turns into butterflies.

01:42:08.061 --> 01:42:09.820
TRAVIS: Not the fucking butterflies.

01:42:11.815 --> 01:42:14.030
SAM: What's a pleasant smell from Caleb's childhood?

01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:15.655
(as Caleb) The blood of my parents.

01:42:15.655 --> 01:42:16.912
(laughter)

01:42:16.912 --> 01:42:19.285
LIAM: Well, it might be, because I rolled a 73?

01:42:19.285 --> 01:42:20.735
Which is really close to what you rolled.

01:42:20.735 --> 01:42:22.441
TRAVIS: That's right, 77.

01:42:22.441 --> 01:42:24.282
MATT: (disappointed) Aw, hmm.

01:42:25.449 --> 01:42:27.615
You see this brief sparkle

01:42:27.615 --> 01:42:29.875
of magical energy form around it

01:42:29.875 --> 01:42:32.201
and then sink in its body, and no effect.

01:42:32.201 --> 01:42:33.505
LAURA and ASHLEY: (gasp)

01:42:33.505 --> 01:42:37.126
SAM: Wait, what?
TRAVIS: Oh, it cancels the nat 20?

01:42:37.126 --> 01:42:38.635
MATT: No, no, you still do the damage.

01:42:38.635 --> 01:42:42.015
The additional effect here, in this particular circumstance,

01:42:42.015 --> 01:42:43.101
does nothing, unfortunately.

01:42:43.101 --> 01:42:45.385
LAURA: Oh, bummer.
LIAM: Okay.

01:42:45.385 --> 01:42:47.382
MATT: It would have been be really funny if it did.

01:42:47.382 --> 01:42:49.518
LAURA: Did the automaton cancel it out?

01:42:50.415 --> 01:42:51.564
MATT: No, I mean--

01:42:51.564 --> 01:42:53.865
LIAM: The magic got sucked up by Eiselcross, right?

01:42:53.865 --> 01:42:55.289
SAM: Or it's an effect that doesn't

01:42:55.289 --> 01:42:56.355
pertain to this situation.
MATT: It's an effect

01:42:56.355 --> 01:42:59.705
that does not apply to this creature, unfortunately.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:43:00.724 --> 01:43:02.525
LIAM: But it's a crit.
TALIESIN: Turned it into a pig or something.

01:43:02.525 --> 01:43:03.645
MATT: A sheep.
TALIESIN: Sheep.

01:43:03.645 --> 01:43:05.311
TRAVIS: It is a crit.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:43:05.311 --> 01:43:08.477
MATT: Yeah. Legitimately, it would
have Polymorphed it into a sheep.

01:43:08.477 --> 01:43:09.310
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck, man.

01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:11.845
(groaning)

01:43:11.845 --> 01:43:13.188
LIAM: That'd would've been dope.
MATT: It can't be Polymorphed.

01:43:13.188 --> 01:43:15.075
TALIESIN: We could've sheered it and run.

01:43:15.075 --> 01:43:17.619
MARISHA: If you would've punched it into a sheep.

01:43:17.619 --> 01:43:20.991
(laughter)

01:43:20.991 --> 01:43:22.335
TRAVIS: Pretty amazing stuff.

01:43:22.335 --> 01:43:23.492
LIAM: Caleb would've been like,

01:43:23.492 --> 01:43:26.945
"Oh, I'm the greatest wizard ever."

01:43:26.945 --> 01:43:29.995
46 points of bludgeoning damage for my bonus action.

01:43:29.995 --> 01:43:31.574
MATT: Gotcha, yeah, and--?

01:43:31.574 --> 01:43:34.875
LIAM: And then, but he sent it--
he didn't even see that happen.

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:37.735
He went down, pulled out a snake adder's stomach,

01:43:37.735 --> 01:43:39.965
and then just pulled it back down his arm,

01:43:39.965 --> 01:43:42.785
and let go Acid Arrows at level four.

01:43:42.785 --> 01:43:44.470
So I'm sending acid arrows at it as well.

01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:46.425
SAM: Ooh.
MATT: Okay.

01:43:46.425 --> 01:43:48.125
SAM: Acid arrows, bro.

01:43:48.125 --> 01:43:49.937
TALIESIN: But it doesn't-- well, 19.

01:43:49.937 --> 01:43:52.255
TALIESIN: Dream about the sheep, man.

01:43:52.255 --> 01:43:53.435
LIAM: What's the deal with--

01:43:53.435 --> 01:43:56.095
MATT: Liam, I'll save you the spell slot.

01:43:56.095 --> 01:43:57.326
How do you want to do this?

01:43:57.326 --> 01:43:59.398
(cheering)

01:43:59.398 --> 01:44:00.615
LIAM: What did it? Was it the claw?

01:44:00.615 --> 01:44:02.895
MATT: It was the punch, yeah.
LIAM: Oh, the claw.

01:44:02.895 --> 01:44:04.151
TALIESIN: Counted sheep to death.

01:44:04.151 --> 01:44:04.984
MATT: (laughs)

01:44:04.984 --> 01:44:08.565
LIAM: I would say that the claw, as it was rocketing,

01:44:08.565 --> 01:44:12.485
it almost like a handful of quarters, a quarter roll,

01:44:12.485 --> 01:44:15.415
grips the gem and if this breaks the gem, so be it,

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:18.463
and just goes-- (fist pounding)

01:44:18.463 --> 01:44:19.638
MARISHA: (bleats)
LIAM: -- smashing it against the wall.

01:44:19.638 --> 01:44:22.785
MATT: As it repeatedly bludgeons into the torso--

01:44:22.785 --> 01:44:24.385
LIAM: I do my best Beau impression.

01:44:24.385 --> 01:44:25.375
MATT: There you go.

01:44:25.375 --> 01:44:26.655
You watch with each impact,

01:44:26.655 --> 01:44:29.425
its body begins to crack open wider and wider,

01:44:29.425 --> 01:44:32.195
until eventually one impact of the cat's claw fist

01:44:32.195 --> 01:44:33.685
hits the armor, it buckles,

01:44:33.685 --> 01:44:37.395
and you watch as the fist seems to vanish into its chest.

01:44:37.395 --> 01:44:40.685
It stands there for a second. (sparking)

01:44:40.685 --> 01:44:43.235
The back side of its armor explodes

01:44:43.235 --> 01:44:44.985
and a flash of electrical energy

01:44:44.985 --> 01:44:46.955
and bits of its armor just shatters

01:44:46.955 --> 01:44:48.646
and scatters across the entire back wall.

01:44:48.646 --> 01:44:49.665
(metal clanging)

01:44:49.665 --> 01:44:51.475
All the way down the sides of the stairs

01:44:51.475 --> 01:44:52.585
and the middle of the chamber,

01:44:52.585 --> 01:44:54.665
as its body now has this gaping hole in the center

01:44:54.665 --> 01:44:55.825
and the cat's claw on the other side

01:44:55.825 --> 01:44:58.383
is sitting there, floating, clutching the gem.

01:44:58.383 --> 01:45:01.595
The central red gem in its face (sparks)

01:45:01.595 --> 01:45:04.645
and just goes dull before it (creaking)

01:45:04.645 --> 01:45:06.295
falls over the railing.

01:45:06.295 --> 01:45:07.239
(whooshing)

01:45:07.239 --> 01:45:08.765
Yasha, you have to back out of the way,

01:45:08.765 --> 01:45:11.325
as it clatters to the ground with a heavy impact

01:45:11.325 --> 01:45:14.645
and you see smoke, and dust, and bits of stone debris

01:45:14.645 --> 01:45:17.450
gets caught up into the air as it slowly settles

01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:18.283
(air whooshing)

01:45:18.283 --> 01:45:20.316
into quiet. You can see its ruined,

01:45:20.316 --> 01:45:22.174
no longer functioning form there,

01:45:22.174 --> 01:45:24.245
lying still on the ground.

01:45:24.245 --> 01:45:27.720
MARISHA: Woo hoo hoo! Yeah!
(applause)

01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:28.911
TRAVIS: Nicely done!

01:45:28.911 --> 01:45:31.620
LIAM: Somewhere, a spectral sheep is going, eh eh. Mm.

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:35.595
MATT: I know, I know.
MARISHA: Now's my cha-- eh.

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:36.765
TALIESIN: Sheep in the NPC lounge.

01:45:36.765 --> 01:45:38.157
LAURA: Ooh, we should get out of here.

01:45:38.157 --> 01:45:39.665
LIAM: ♪ God, I hope I get it. ♪

01:45:39.665 --> 01:45:43.425
LAURA: I'm want to go over and
try to get that gem out of its head.

01:45:43.425 --> 01:45:44.872
MATT: Okay.

01:45:44.872 --> 01:45:46.397
SAM: I'm going to use--
TRAVIS: It explodes.

01:45:47.336 --> 01:45:49.236
MATT: How do you try and remove it?

01:45:50.188 --> 01:45:51.646
SAM: How would you like to remove this?

01:45:51.646 --> 01:45:52.479
MATT: (laughs)

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:54.909
LAURA: I guess, I don't have any daggers or anything.

01:45:54.909 --> 01:45:56.575
TRAVIS: You have a handaxe, right?
LAURA: Yeah, I've got an axe,

01:45:56.575 --> 01:45:58.037
so I'll try to take the axe out and go--

01:45:58.037 --> 01:46:00.095
SAM: My banana peel.
LAURA: -- and like--

01:46:00.095 --> 01:46:02.128
TALIESIN: It's screwed in, you just have to twist.

01:46:03.325 --> 01:46:05.085
Like a light bulb.

01:46:05.085 --> 01:46:07.955
LAURA: Get the edge of the axe in and pop it like a hammer.

01:46:07.955 --> 01:46:10.455
LAURA: Okay, go ahead and make a strength check for me.

01:46:11.295 --> 01:46:14.490
TALIESIN: Still with-- no, never mind.
LAURA: Guide me!

01:46:14.490 --> 01:46:15.323
Aw.

01:46:16.404 --> 01:46:20.975
Oh, my patron didn't appreciate that.

01:46:20.975 --> 01:46:24.125
Five plus three.

01:46:24.125 --> 01:46:26.355
MATT: This is your standard, basic handaxe?

01:46:26.355 --> 01:46:29.405
LAURA: This was with my-- yes.

01:46:29.405 --> 01:46:32.058
My handaxe of two, plus two, plus one.

01:46:33.035 --> 01:46:35.095
MATT: Wait, two, plus two, plus one?

01:46:35.095 --> 01:46:36.556
LAURA: My handaxe plus one.

01:46:36.556 --> 01:46:37.656
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:46:37.656 --> 01:46:39.772
So it doesn't break, because it is magical.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:46:39.772 --> 01:46:42.685
MATT: But as you slam it, it's like clink. Ugh!

01:46:42.685 --> 01:46:44.165
It does hurt your hand.

01:46:44.165 --> 01:46:45.245
It's not quite giving.

01:46:45.245 --> 01:46:47.032
This isn't like the gem in the ceiling

01:46:47.032 --> 01:46:48.707
that was placed in as part of this.

01:46:48.707 --> 01:46:51.845
This is embedded deeply within its armored head

01:46:51.845 --> 01:46:52.795
and it's going to take a little more

01:46:52.795 --> 01:46:54.465
than just wedging it out with a handaxe.

01:46:54.465 --> 01:46:57.905
LAURA: I pull my axe out and chop the head off.

01:46:57.905 --> 01:47:01.635
MATT: Okay, it's pretty heavy armor.

01:47:01.635 --> 01:47:03.497
You can do this, it'll take a while.

01:47:03.497 --> 01:47:04.945
LAURA: Oh, come on.

01:47:04.945 --> 01:47:09.475
LIAM: The claw vanishes and the gem
just goes (thudding) onto the ground.

01:47:09.475 --> 01:47:12.045
And I come over and start looking over the body as well,

01:47:12.045 --> 01:47:14.958
trying to see if I can find
that part that I was looking for.

01:47:14.958 --> 01:47:16.872
MATT: Make an arcana check.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:47:16.872 --> 01:47:19.015
TALIESIN: I think my Detect Magic is still up

01:47:19.015 --> 01:47:20.168
because it's 10 minutes.

01:47:22.205 --> 01:47:23.955
MATT: Is it concentration?

01:47:23.955 --> 01:47:26.423
TALIESIN: No, well, maybe. Let's find out.

01:47:26.423 --> 01:47:27.865
MATT: Double check.
TALIESIN: That's a good question.

01:47:27.865 --> 01:47:29.838
LIAM: 27.
MATT: 27.

01:47:30.775 --> 01:47:33.415
The gem that's in its face--

01:47:33.415 --> 01:47:34.345
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're right, never mind.

01:47:34.345 --> 01:47:35.475
MATT: Yeah, so that would have faded.

01:47:35.475 --> 01:47:36.615
The gem that in its face

01:47:36.615 --> 01:47:40.706
is more of a specific visual-based element.

01:47:42.875 --> 01:47:44.915
If you would want to inspect its body,

01:47:44.915 --> 01:47:47.245
there is a possible chance of finding

01:47:47.245 --> 01:47:49.055
a power core of some kind

01:47:49.055 --> 01:47:50.845
if it hasn't been destroyed

01:47:50.845 --> 01:47:53.045
in the circumstances of the previous battle.

01:47:53.045 --> 01:47:54.212
So make an investigation check.

01:47:54.212 --> 01:47:55.045
LIAM: Okay.

01:47:59.645 --> 01:48:02.105
24.
MATT: 24, okay.

01:48:02.105 --> 01:48:04.583
And I would like for you to roll a d20 for me,

01:48:04.583 --> 01:48:07.335
just standard d20. On an 11 or higher,

01:48:07.335 --> 01:48:09.443
it's still intact.

01:48:09.443 --> 01:48:11.265
LIAM: 12.
(gasping)

01:48:11.265 --> 01:48:12.635
MATT: As you're rummaging through the body,

01:48:12.635 --> 01:48:15.326
you find, embedded and attached to it,

01:48:15.326 --> 01:48:18.467
this semi-spherical cage,

01:48:18.467 --> 01:48:19.595
like this lattice work,

01:48:19.595 --> 01:48:20.995
not dissimilar from the stone latticework

01:48:20.995 --> 01:48:25.355
you were going to create beneath the threshold crest.

01:48:25.355 --> 01:48:28.315
But you find this cage that's bent and twisted backward

01:48:28.315 --> 01:48:31.795
and it looks like it just narrowly missed being destroyed

01:48:31.795 --> 01:48:33.805
from the impact of your spell,

01:48:33.805 --> 01:48:36.675
but you pull in, and with Jester's help,

01:48:36.675 --> 01:48:39.655
the two of you detach the elements of the cage

01:48:39.655 --> 01:48:41.945
that are currently holding via these metal spikes,

01:48:41.945 --> 01:48:43.275
the core in the center,

01:48:43.275 --> 01:48:44.505
and you gingerly remove it.

01:48:44.505 --> 01:48:48.455
And it's an almost octagonal,

01:48:48.455 --> 01:48:50.988
if not slightly oblong, gem

01:48:50.988 --> 01:48:54.745
that has this very, very faint,

01:48:54.745 --> 01:48:59.225
dull orangish-yellow color to it

01:48:59.225 --> 01:49:02.406
that just gives off this very faint glow of light.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.395
LIAM: Could you just saw away that
little bit of metal near it?

01:49:11.726 --> 01:49:15.323
LAURA: That was an axe, sawing with an axe.

01:49:16.185 --> 01:49:19.525
MARISHA: Oh god, she's going to cut herself one day, oh no.

01:49:19.525 --> 01:49:20.775
LIAM: I'll save that for a rainy day.

01:49:20.775 --> 01:49:22.408
We should get out of here.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:49:22.408 --> 01:49:23.606
LAURA: We should definitely get out of here.

01:49:23.606 --> 01:49:26.405
TRAVIS: How are we moving this huge stone?

01:49:26.405 --> 01:49:27.465
LAURA: We carry it.

01:49:27.465 --> 01:49:31.365
LIAM: We carry it, if we think we have 10 or 15 minutes,

01:49:31.365 --> 01:49:32.198
I can put it in here,

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:34.495
and I hold up amber.

01:49:34.495 --> 01:49:35.676
TRAVIS: It's true.
LIAM: It's heavy.

01:49:35.676 --> 01:49:36.588
TRAVIS: Be the easier way to do it.

01:49:36.588 --> 01:49:37.829
Do we have 15 minutes?
MARISHA: That's a great idea.

01:49:37.829 --> 01:49:39.455
TALIESIN: That's a great idea.

01:49:39.455 --> 01:49:41.155
LIAM: Okay, so I set to work,

01:49:41.155 --> 01:49:42.665
put out the pieces of amber, start casting,

01:49:42.665 --> 01:49:43.498
takes 10 minutes.

01:49:43.498 --> 01:49:47.475
LAURA: During that time, I'll try to
get this gem out of the head.

01:49:47.475 --> 01:49:49.845
MATT: Okay. I'll say, with a little bit of time,

01:49:49.845 --> 01:49:52.465
you manage to, along with the help of your friends

01:49:52.465 --> 01:49:54.545
and some spotted eye work by Caleb,

01:49:54.545 --> 01:49:57.185
who understands the inner workings of this,

01:49:57.185 --> 01:49:58.205
you manage to dislodge it.

01:49:58.205 --> 01:50:00.685
And this one is spherical.

01:50:00.685 --> 01:50:02.565
It has an attachment point at the back of it

01:50:02.565 --> 01:50:05.895
where it looks like a jeweler's filagree

01:50:05.895 --> 01:50:06.728
at the back of it,

01:50:06.728 --> 01:50:09.775
where this rubbery cord was attached to.

01:50:09.775 --> 01:50:11.235
And as you finally manage to pull it free,

01:50:11.235 --> 01:50:14.085
easier to do from the inside out, from underneath the neck

01:50:14.085 --> 01:50:15.235
as opposed to the front of the face

01:50:15.235 --> 01:50:16.735
and where it's specifically designed

01:50:16.735 --> 01:50:19.845
to be too closed off for it to be pulled forward,

01:50:19.845 --> 01:50:21.645
you manage to pull it, instead, reverse-wise

01:50:21.645 --> 01:50:22.895
from inside and pluck it out.

01:50:22.895 --> 01:50:25.415
And it's lighter weight than you expected,

01:50:25.415 --> 01:50:28.145
it doesn't feel like a solid gem,

01:50:28.145 --> 01:50:29.555
or at least it doesn't match the weight

01:50:29.555 --> 01:50:31.737
of other similar materials.

01:50:31.737 --> 01:50:33.715
LAURA: Hmm, and it's red in color?

01:50:33.715 --> 01:50:34.548
MATT: It's red, yeah.

01:50:34.548 --> 01:50:36.404
And you hold it up to a little bit of the light,

01:50:36.404 --> 01:50:37.675
and you can hold up near the light

01:50:37.675 --> 01:50:41.945
of where the source is emanating from the threshold crest.

01:50:41.945 --> 01:50:43.865
You can see it looks very cloudy towards its center.

01:50:43.865 --> 01:50:45.365
LAURA: Ooh!

01:50:45.365 --> 01:50:48.048
TRAVIS: Is it a rough gem or is it cut?

01:50:48.048 --> 01:50:52.335
MATT: It's smooth. It's a polished, almost perfect sphere

01:50:52.335 --> 01:50:54.675
except for the very back of it where it was attached.

01:50:54.675 --> 01:50:56.517
LIAM: Okay, would you like to me to--

01:50:56.517 --> 01:50:57.980
I'll figure it out later.

01:50:57.980 --> 01:50:59.315
And I just put it in the circle.

01:50:59.315 --> 01:51:00.935
MATT: Okay.

01:51:00.935 --> 01:51:01.985
ASHLEY: I go get my sword.
TRAVIS: Should we exfil

01:51:01.985 --> 01:51:03.435
with quickness?

01:51:03.435 --> 01:51:04.835
LAURA: Yeah, well, he's got to put it in the thing.

01:51:04.835 --> 01:51:06.215
SAM: We got 10 minutes.
TRAVIS: Oh yes, no. I'm sorry.

01:51:06.215 --> 01:51:07.815
SAM: I'm going to grab my banana peel.

01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:10.310
Make sure it doesn't...
ASHLEY: Yeah, banana peel

01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:12.045
and I'll grab my sword.

01:51:12.045 --> 01:51:13.495
MATT: Carefully retrieved, oh,

01:51:13.495 --> 01:51:15.247
you were so close to having that banana peel

01:51:15.247 --> 01:51:17.575
do possibly something, but--

01:51:17.575 --> 01:51:19.378
SAM: Could've killed everyone in the room.

01:51:19.378 --> 01:51:22.065
(laughter)

01:51:22.065 --> 01:51:25.236
LIAM: Slowly put the banana back in the peel.

01:51:25.236 --> 01:51:27.973
ASHLEY: It's okay, my weapon didn't do anything, either.

01:51:27.973 --> 01:51:29.078
SAM: I'm sorry I left you up there.

01:51:29.078 --> 01:51:31.355
ASHLEY: Banana peel-- no, it's not your fault.

01:51:31.355 --> 01:51:32.785
Hey, we got the stone out.

01:51:32.785 --> 01:51:34.415
SAM: Yeah, you did great up there.

01:51:34.415 --> 01:51:37.365
You were so angry at that thing.

01:51:37.365 --> 01:51:38.835
ASHLEY: Well, I was trying to get it out.

01:51:38.835 --> 01:51:41.285
I just felt like I couldn't do anything,

01:51:41.285 --> 01:51:42.575
I wasn't helping in the fight.

01:51:42.575 --> 01:51:44.004
SAM: You did it, though.

01:51:44.004 --> 01:51:46.665
ASHLEY: (growls)
(laughter)

01:51:46.665 --> 01:51:48.555
SAM: We should celebrate somehow.

01:51:48.555 --> 01:51:50.972
Oh, you know what, tomorrow, you and me,

01:51:50.972 --> 01:51:52.348
we're going to do something to celebrate.

01:51:52.348 --> 01:51:55.813
MARISHA: You dick, you piece of fucking shit.
ASHLEY: I feel like--

01:51:55.813 --> 01:51:58.725
SAM: Because the chips were down in this fight,

01:51:58.725 --> 01:52:00.745
but we came back and we proved our worth,

01:52:00.745 --> 01:52:02.095
you and me, tomorrow night.

01:52:03.265 --> 01:52:04.815
We'll figure out something.
ASHLEY: I'm busy.

01:52:04.815 --> 01:52:06.065
I have plans.

01:52:06.065 --> 01:52:08.545
SAM: No, I mean, we're on a crazy island of doom,

01:52:08.545 --> 01:52:10.466
you don't have plans, that's impossible.

01:52:10.466 --> 01:52:14.035
(laughter)

01:52:14.035 --> 01:52:18.335
ASHLEY: I do, though, that I need to stick to.

01:52:18.335 --> 01:52:19.805
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:52:21.068 --> 01:52:23.159
ASHLEY: (stammering) I have a--

01:52:23.159 --> 01:52:25.673
Why do I need to tell you guys?!

01:52:25.673 --> 01:52:27.257
LIAM: We have no secrets in this group.

01:52:27.257 --> 01:52:29.780
SAM: You know, we're a found family or whatever.

01:52:31.758 --> 01:52:33.805
LIAM: We tell each other everything.

01:52:33.805 --> 01:52:35.796
ASHLEY: Sure.

01:52:35.796 --> 01:52:37.504
What should we do?

01:52:37.504 --> 01:52:39.587
We're unsafe and it's dangerous.

01:52:39.587 --> 01:52:41.092
SAM: We have eight more minutes.

01:52:41.092 --> 01:52:42.414
TRAVIS: "What should we do?"

01:52:43.730 --> 01:52:46.635
SAM: We're just sitting around for eight minutes!

01:52:46.635 --> 01:52:49.794
LIAM: Sorry it's taking me so long. (casting noises)

01:52:49.794 --> 01:52:51.215
TRAVIS: Wubba, wubba, wizard, wizard.

01:52:51.215 --> 01:52:53.075
TALIESIN: I'll step over there with the...

01:52:53.075 --> 01:52:55.435
ASHLEY: I'm going to check out this room a little bit more

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:57.935
just to see if there's anything else we need.

01:52:57.935 --> 01:53:00.555
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: (garbles)

01:53:00.555 --> 01:53:04.825
ASHLEY: I'm going to look around
and see if there's any extra items.

01:53:04.825 --> 01:53:09.758
Hey, the lance, the sword in his hand!

01:53:09.758 --> 01:53:11.202
TRAVIS: Yeah, the big shish kebab.
ASHLEY: I'm going to take it.

01:53:11.202 --> 01:53:13.575
MATT: Okay, and you're able to eventually

01:53:13.575 --> 01:53:16.208
dislodge it from the arm after cutting through its area.

01:53:16.208 --> 01:53:18.945
It is like a lance,

01:53:18.945 --> 01:53:23.875
like what people would joust with on a horse,

01:53:23.875 --> 01:53:26.315
except for on one end, it seems to be rounded on one end

01:53:26.315 --> 01:53:29.415
and is bladed on the other, like a long rapier

01:53:29.415 --> 01:53:30.248
with a little hook,

01:53:30.248 --> 01:53:32.835
a little barb on the end that comes backward.

01:53:32.835 --> 01:53:36.555
ASHLEY: Can we store this anywhere or this is too big?

01:53:36.555 --> 01:53:37.435
TRAVIS: You could store it.

01:53:37.435 --> 01:53:38.815
LAURA: On your back.

01:53:38.815 --> 01:53:41.148
TRAVIS: You can put it in the bag of holding, if you want.

01:53:41.148 --> 01:53:43.148
ASHLEY: I don't know if I want a lance, though.

01:53:44.437 --> 01:53:45.595
MARISHA: You can always sell it.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:53:45.595 --> 01:53:46.955
TALIESIN: We'll get rid of it.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:53:46.955 --> 01:53:48.125
TRAVIS: Did the other body,

01:53:48.125 --> 01:53:49.732
the other suit of armor that was under the rubble,

01:53:49.732 --> 01:53:52.296
did it have a weapon near it?

01:53:52.296 --> 01:53:53.855
LAURA: It was just like a person, right?

01:53:53.855 --> 01:53:56.095
MATT: Yeah, it didn't appear to have a weapon of any kind.

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:58.298
LAURA: It was just like a C-3PO.
LIAM: The android.

01:53:59.405 --> 01:54:01.175
MARISHA: While they're doing that,

01:54:01.175 --> 01:54:04.785
and I'm not hearing the conversation that Veth was having,

01:54:04.785 --> 01:54:06.858
I'm going to go over to Caduceus.

01:54:09.555 --> 01:54:11.880
Thank you, again.

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.463
TALIESIN: Of course.
MARISHA: For keeping me alive.

01:54:13.463 --> 01:54:16.178
TALIESIN: Well, you know, you got stuff to do later, so.

01:54:17.345 --> 01:54:18.728
MARISHA: Speaking of.
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:54:18.728 --> 01:54:22.436
MARISHA: I was kind of curious about your stuff to do.

01:54:24.105 --> 01:54:26.485
You seem very uneasy with this forest

01:54:26.485 --> 01:54:28.725
that we're about to have to go back through

01:54:28.725 --> 01:54:30.845
and that you have thoughts, and feelings,

01:54:30.845 --> 01:54:33.155
and I don't know.

01:54:33.155 --> 01:54:34.128
We're about to go back through.

01:54:34.128 --> 01:54:37.736
I just wanted to get your temperature on this.

01:54:37.736 --> 01:54:42.033
TALIESIN: This place is-- I don't like this place.

01:54:45.225 --> 01:54:49.035
That thing in there, that's not a forest,

01:54:49.035 --> 01:54:50.335
I don't know what that is.

01:54:55.018 --> 01:54:57.635
I don't even know how to explain what it felt like

01:54:57.635 --> 01:55:00.016
and what we saw in there. It's--

01:55:03.165 --> 01:55:07.990
I was sort of raised to

01:55:09.507 --> 01:55:13.073
protect and respect life and death.

01:55:13.935 --> 01:55:16.343
And

01:55:16.343 --> 01:55:20.593
there are things in this world that are,

01:55:22.975 --> 01:55:24.735
I would say, perversions of death,

01:55:24.735 --> 01:55:29.735
things that mock death, and that, I'm used to.

01:55:30.245 --> 01:55:34.984
That in there, it mocks life.

01:55:34.984 --> 01:55:39.289
It's whatever, it's whatever--

01:55:39.289 --> 01:55:40.822
it's everything that's wrong,

01:55:40.822 --> 01:55:43.613
it's nothing I ever even imagined. It's--

01:55:45.861 --> 01:55:48.328
I kind of want to burn it on the way out.

01:55:50.065 --> 01:55:51.395
MARISHA: Do you think it even can burn?

01:55:51.395 --> 01:55:54.805
It's lived underground, devoid of sunlight

01:55:54.805 --> 01:55:56.155
for thousands of years.

01:55:56.155 --> 01:55:58.185
TALIESIN: It's not living, it's not lived underground,

01:55:58.185 --> 01:55:59.251
I don't know what that is.

01:55:59.251 --> 01:56:00.585
MARISHA: But it's not dead either?

01:56:00.585 --> 01:56:04.555
TALIESIN: No, it's just wrong.

01:56:04.555 --> 01:56:07.065
MARISHA: Does it remind you of the corruption in the grove?

01:56:07.065 --> 01:56:10.218
TALIESIN: No, it is--
MARISHA: Worse?

01:56:10.218 --> 01:56:12.258
TALIESIN: I don't have the imagination for it.

01:56:13.385 --> 01:56:14.585
I don't know what it is.

01:56:17.615 --> 01:56:19.645
I'm going to see some of the things

01:56:19.645 --> 01:56:23.865
that we've been seeing for a long time when I sleep.

01:56:23.865 --> 01:56:27.295
This is just-- I don't know what this is, I don't like it.

01:56:27.295 --> 01:56:28.745
I don't like a lot down here.

01:56:29.665 --> 01:56:32.495
MARISHA: What if burning it unleashes something worse?

01:56:32.495 --> 01:56:34.505
What if it's harboring something?

01:56:34.505 --> 01:56:37.358
TALIESIN: That is the only thing that's giving me pause.

01:56:39.395 --> 01:56:40.436
MARISHA: All right.
TALIESIN: But it--

01:56:40.436 --> 01:56:41.894
LIAM: (whispering) Arboring.

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:43.927
TALIESIN: It would be a mercy.
MARISHA: Arboring?

01:56:43.927 --> 01:56:44.760
LIAM: Sorry.

01:56:45.981 --> 01:56:50.098
TALIESIN: Whatever's going on in these places is just,

01:56:51.355 --> 01:56:52.655
we can't let this get out.

01:56:54.325 --> 01:56:56.975
I know Jester thinks that I'm not taking this seriously

01:56:56.975 --> 01:56:58.835
because I don't want to just break it here and now,

01:56:58.835 --> 01:57:00.305
but I don't think we can,

01:57:00.305 --> 01:57:02.875
and I want to live to get out of here

01:57:02.875 --> 01:57:04.368
so that we can stop this.

01:57:07.715 --> 01:57:09.445
Getting in here has, I'm very tired.

01:57:09.445 --> 01:57:12.358
I don't know where you are, but I am very tired.

01:57:13.225 --> 01:57:16.585
MARISHA: Well, I have feeling back
in my hands thanks to you,

01:57:16.585 --> 01:57:21.292
so that's a step forward.

01:57:21.292 --> 01:57:23.885
TALIESIN: Getting out of here could be rough.

01:57:23.885 --> 01:57:25.835
MARISHA: I think you're right.

01:57:25.835 --> 01:57:28.825
TALIESIN: And we got to take that
thing as far away as we can

01:57:28.825 --> 01:57:31.105
so that we can figure out what to do with it,

01:57:31.105 --> 01:57:34.385
but I don't think it's going to break.

01:57:34.385 --> 01:57:36.485
MARISHA: You're probably right, but I agree with Jester,

01:57:36.485 --> 01:57:37.810
and my biggest fear is that

01:57:37.810 --> 01:57:42.810
we encounter Lucien

01:57:43.055 --> 01:57:44.835
and he takes it from us.

01:57:44.835 --> 01:57:46.676
TALIESIN: There's something wrong with your friend.

01:57:47.855 --> 01:57:49.400
MARISHA: Yeah!
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:57:50.535 --> 01:57:53.075
MARISHA: I've always known that, since day one,

01:57:53.075 --> 01:57:54.385
let me just tell you that.

01:57:54.385 --> 01:57:55.845
TALIESIN: Well, I mean from the stories I've heard,

01:57:55.845 --> 01:57:56.915
there's something really wrong.

01:57:56.915 --> 01:57:59.215
I mean, there's wrong-- there's cute wrong

01:57:59.215 --> 01:58:00.698
and then there's whatever--

01:58:01.705 --> 01:58:03.471
I respect cute wrong.

01:58:05.413 --> 01:58:06.246
MARISHA: Same.

01:58:07.735 --> 01:58:09.285
All right, well, I guess--

01:58:09.285 --> 01:58:10.235
let me know what you think

01:58:10.235 --> 01:58:11.935
as we go back through this forest.

01:58:13.785 --> 01:58:15.025
We're with you.

01:58:15.025 --> 01:58:17.285
TALIESIN: I'll talk to Jester and I'll see what she thinks.

01:58:17.285 --> 01:58:20.626
MARISHA: Hey, are we going to have to deal with

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:22.612
this lava river again?

01:58:22.612 --> 01:58:24.198
TALIESIN: The what?
MARISHA: The lava.

01:58:26.385 --> 01:58:30.315
TALIESIN: I'd forgotten. I'd forgotten that we'd even--

01:58:30.315 --> 01:58:33.658
MARISHA: May be a good place to destroy things.

01:58:34.975 --> 01:58:38.015
TALIESIN: Or at least a good place to prove that we can't.

01:58:38.015 --> 01:58:38.931
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:58:40.182 --> 01:58:41.039
TALIESIN: That's a plan,

01:58:41.039 --> 01:58:42.065
that's a good plan.

01:58:42.065 --> 01:58:45.430
MARISHA: Just reminds me of the kiln in Uthodurn.

01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:46.263
Outside of it.

01:58:46.263 --> 01:58:47.865
TALIESIN: Kiln is special.

01:58:47.865 --> 01:58:50.265
There's lava and then there's...

01:58:50.265 --> 01:58:51.448
MARISHA: Magic lava?

01:58:51.448 --> 01:58:53.089
TALIESIN: The blood of the earth.

01:58:54.225 --> 01:58:55.958
That's just--

01:58:55.958 --> 01:58:57.605
MARISHA: Okay, you're saying a lot of weird shit, Caduceus.

01:58:57.605 --> 01:58:58.721
TALIESIN: I'm having a weird day.

01:58:58.721 --> 01:59:00.388
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:03.925
I don't want to fill your head with stuff;

01:59:03.925 --> 01:59:04.775
you've got stuff to do.

01:59:04.775 --> 01:59:06.735
Congratulations, by the way, well done.

01:59:06.735 --> 01:59:07.785
I won't tell anybody.

01:59:09.573 --> 01:59:11.195
LAURA: (giggles)

01:59:11.195 --> 01:59:13.088
MARISHA: What? As he walks away.

01:59:14.547 --> 01:59:15.380
TALIESIN: And I walk away.

01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:17.180
MATT: Okay, yeah.

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.589
MARISHA: (stammering)

01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:21.465
MATT: While that conversation's happening,

01:59:21.465 --> 01:59:23.895
you were heading up the hallway.

01:59:23.895 --> 01:59:26.505
As you ascend the stairs, you can see now,

01:59:26.505 --> 01:59:31.505
that smooth, well-carved, high, tall hallway arches

01:59:31.985 --> 01:59:33.675
that you guys had walked through,

01:59:33.675 --> 01:59:36.515
there are edges of the walls that are just scraped

01:59:36.515 --> 01:59:38.535
and ground where you see this creature

01:59:38.535 --> 01:59:41.875
was not able to maintain a direct flow of movement.

01:59:41.875 --> 01:59:45.015
It was just crashing into and scraping along the sides

01:59:45.015 --> 01:59:46.415
as it barrelled towards you.

01:59:48.105 --> 01:59:49.365
It already came through

01:59:49.365 --> 01:59:52.468
sustaining quite some physical damage.

01:59:54.665 --> 01:59:57.435
But you continue beyond that.

01:59:57.435 --> 01:59:59.695
You come to the two sides of the T intersection

01:59:59.695 --> 02:00:04.695
where the force field had been placed, still good.

02:00:04.695 --> 02:00:06.305
TRAVIS: No sounds, no voices?

02:00:06.305 --> 02:00:07.665
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:00:07.665 --> 02:00:08.865
TALIESIN: I'll join you in that.

02:00:11.766 --> 02:00:13.525
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: Okay.

02:00:15.564 --> 02:00:16.905
TALIESIN: 22.
MATT: 22, okay.

02:00:16.905 --> 02:00:18.695
When you eventually catch up, we'll get to that.

02:00:18.695 --> 02:00:20.515
TALIESIN: Oh sorry, yeah.
MATT: It's okay.

02:00:20.515 --> 02:00:23.365
But listening out, you don't hear anything, eerily still,

02:00:24.455 --> 02:00:28.638
like a lot of what you traversed here beneath the ice.

02:00:29.555 --> 02:00:30.855
TRAVIS: I'll just stay.
MATT: Okay.

02:00:33.345 --> 02:00:35.258
You complete your spell,

02:00:36.585 --> 02:00:39.155
managing to take the stone and encapsulate it

02:00:39.155 --> 02:00:41.138
within your amber vault.

02:00:42.875 --> 02:00:45.095
You catch up with Fjord while this is happening

02:00:45.095 --> 02:00:47.678
and also listening, it's eerily still.

02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:51.155
Joining him, looking past the exit

02:00:51.155 --> 02:00:52.395
that leads into that forest,

02:00:52.395 --> 02:00:56.355
you can see the same purple-gray foliage

02:00:57.225 --> 02:01:00.465
that just haunts you.

02:01:00.465 --> 02:01:02.955
It's alien, yet still so familiar

02:01:04.335 --> 02:01:05.435
and you don't like it.

02:01:06.686 --> 02:01:07.538
TRAVIS: Quiet so far.

02:01:09.705 --> 02:01:11.555
TALIESIN: We should avoid this.

02:01:11.555 --> 02:01:13.065
This is bad.

02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:14.828
TRAVIS: Avoid what, this intersection?

02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:18.865
TALIESIN: This isn't a forest.

02:01:18.865 --> 02:01:21.868
Just be careful. It's malevolent.

02:01:23.105 --> 02:01:24.255
TRAVIS: So find another way?

02:01:25.775 --> 02:01:27.125
TALIESIN: Is there a way around it?

02:01:28.297 --> 02:01:30.155
I dunno. We flew, if I recall.

02:01:30.155 --> 02:01:32.055
TRAVIS: We did.

02:01:32.055 --> 02:01:34.695
If we can find another way, we could try.

02:01:34.695 --> 02:01:35.985
LIAM: Should we check the perimeter

02:01:35.985 --> 02:01:39.155
outside of the treeline all around?

02:01:39.155 --> 02:01:40.346
Here, by the way, take this.

02:01:40.346 --> 02:01:42.332
And I hand you the amber.

02:01:42.332 --> 02:01:44.145
Put that in the bag.

02:01:44.145 --> 02:01:46.755
TRAVIS: Oh! Are you sure?

02:01:46.755 --> 02:01:48.118
This is usually on you.

02:01:49.327 --> 02:01:51.525
LIAM: Well, we don't want Lucien to see it.

02:01:51.525 --> 02:01:53.795
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's smart. In the bag.

02:01:53.795 --> 02:01:55.644
TALIESIN: Do you want to send a cat?

02:01:55.644 --> 02:01:57.342
LAURA: It's not another dimension, right?

02:01:57.342 --> 02:01:58.969
Your little amber thing, that's not another dimension?

02:01:58.969 --> 02:02:02.104
LIAM: No, no, it's just on ice.

02:02:02.104 --> 02:02:03.830
MATT: It's just for ease of carry.
LAURA: Okay.

02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:06.349
LIAM: And I pat Fjord on the shoulder, too, and say,

02:02:06.349 --> 02:02:07.945
"I thought we were going to lose you there."

02:02:07.945 --> 02:02:11.165
And before he notices it, I brush away some cat hairs,

02:02:11.165 --> 02:02:12.845
before he even notices they're there.

02:02:12.845 --> 02:02:13.685
MATT and LAURA: (laugh)

02:02:13.685 --> 02:02:15.198
LIAM: Let's go, let's check the room.

02:02:18.033 --> 02:02:20.845
(laughter)

02:02:20.845 --> 02:02:21.803
LIAM: Oh, I kicked up the dander.

02:02:21.803 --> 02:02:22.860
TALIESIN: Don't.
MARISHA: Oh no.

02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:24.593
TALIESIN: Don't.

02:02:26.085 --> 02:02:28.585
TRAVIS: Somebody start talking about something else.

02:02:28.585 --> 02:02:29.845
LIAM: Dogs, right, aren't they the best?

02:02:29.845 --> 02:02:31.345
TRAVIS: There ya go.
MATT: There ya go.

02:02:33.305 --> 02:02:34.345
Anybody else doing anything in particular

02:02:34.345 --> 02:02:35.345
while this is happening?

02:02:35.345 --> 02:02:38.019
SAM: While all this was going on, is there--

02:02:38.019 --> 02:02:41.805
the thing that attacked us is made out of metal, right?

02:02:41.805 --> 02:02:43.685
MATT: Which one?
SAM: The big golem thing.

02:02:43.685 --> 02:02:45.905
LIAM: The robot.
MATT: Yes, metal, and stone,

02:02:45.905 --> 02:02:50.263
and other internal...

02:02:50.263 --> 02:02:51.713
yeah, mostly metal and stone.

02:02:51.713 --> 02:02:53.675
SAM: I'm just going to find a shiny piece of metal,

02:02:53.675 --> 02:02:55.721
so I can sort of see my reflection on it,

02:02:55.721 --> 02:02:58.801
and I was just going to practice for a couple minutes.

02:02:58.801 --> 02:03:00.322
I was just going to stare at it and be like,

02:03:00.322 --> 02:03:03.458
"Oh, oh, y-you walkin' at me?

02:03:04.352 --> 02:03:05.185
"You walkin' at me?

02:03:05.185 --> 02:03:07.685
"No one else seems to be walkin' at me, so you must be--"

02:03:07.685 --> 02:03:09.855
(yelps) And I'm going to throw the banana peel,

02:03:09.855 --> 02:03:12.965
just figure out a way to quick throw it.

02:03:12.965 --> 02:03:13.956
TRAVIS: Quick draw?
MATT: Sure.

02:03:13.956 --> 02:03:15.565
SAM: Quick draw.
MATT: Sure, all right,

02:03:15.565 --> 02:03:17.705
so you're quick draw practicing your banana peel.

02:03:17.705 --> 02:03:18.828
SAM: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: You got it.

02:03:18.828 --> 02:03:19.990
Okay, good to know.

02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:21.565
SAM: You know, like a good place to stow it.

02:03:21.565 --> 02:03:22.898
MATT: Make a note of that here.

02:03:22.898 --> 02:03:24.375
MARISHA: Just right in the sleeve?
SAM: Yeah.

02:03:24.375 --> 02:03:26.177
MARISHA: So you can just--
TRAVIS: You walkin' at me, punk?

02:03:26.177 --> 02:03:27.199
SAM: You walkin' at me?
ASHLEY: You walkin' at me?

02:03:27.199 --> 02:03:28.303
LIAM: (gun cocking noise)

02:03:28.303 --> 02:03:30.211
(laughter)

02:03:31.050 --> 02:03:33.501
LIAM: Perfect.
LAURA: I'm going to...

02:03:33.501 --> 02:03:35.770
(laughter)

02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:38.125
MARISHA: Try to just do butterfly knife skills?

02:03:38.125 --> 02:03:40.215
SAM: With a banana peel?

02:03:40.215 --> 02:03:41.595
LAURA: I'm going to sit down on the ground,

02:03:41.595 --> 02:03:45.745
watching Nott play ninja with a banana peel,

02:03:45.745 --> 02:03:47.955
and I'm going to pull out some of the bugs

02:03:47.955 --> 02:03:51.255
that I've been gathering and feed them to Sprinkle.

02:03:51.255 --> 02:03:54.115
SAM: Hey, look at that!

02:03:54.115 --> 02:03:56.675
MATT: Comes out. (smacking)

02:03:56.675 --> 02:03:58.950
LAURA: That was a pretty crazy fight, huh?

02:03:58.950 --> 02:04:01.965
MATT: (chittering)

02:04:01.965 --> 02:04:03.066
LAURA: You're welcome.

02:04:03.066 --> 02:04:04.592
MATT: (chitters) And goes back into your hood.

02:04:04.592 --> 02:04:06.020
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) This changes nothing.

02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:09.275
(laughter)

02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:11.145
MATT: All right, so those of you that are at the front,

02:04:11.145 --> 02:04:12.735
what are you doing?

02:04:12.735 --> 02:04:16.035
LIAM: I think we're going to start checking

02:04:16.035 --> 02:04:17.955
all around the outer edges of this room

02:04:17.955 --> 02:04:20.515
to see if there are any other passages out of here.

02:04:20.515 --> 02:04:24.985
And I will sprinkle some soot and cast Comprehend Languages

02:04:24.985 --> 02:04:28.535
in case there's any writing to be found.
MATT: Okay, no worries.

02:04:28.535 --> 02:04:30.225
Okay.
TALIESIN: Just out of curiosity,

02:04:30.225 --> 02:04:33.255
I'm going to try a Divine Intervention.

02:04:33.255 --> 02:04:34.721
MATT: Okay.

02:04:36.013 --> 02:04:39.071
TALIESIN: If you can see this place,

02:04:39.071 --> 02:04:40.425
what's the safest way out of it

02:04:40.425 --> 02:04:42.625
and what should we do with it once we leave?

02:04:44.575 --> 02:04:46.687
TALIESIN: No.
MARISHA: Oh.

02:04:46.687 --> 02:04:49.975
MATT: Aw, her vision can not pierce the ruin, unfortunately.

02:04:49.975 --> 02:04:52.694
TALIESIN: 39 on the table, so, sorry, no.

02:04:52.694 --> 02:04:54.683
MATT: Doesn't work for that, but yeah.

02:04:54.683 --> 02:04:57.566
LAURA: Can I catch up with Caduceus as we're going?

02:04:57.566 --> 02:04:59.325
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:01.515
LAURA: What do you want to do, Caduceus?

02:05:01.515 --> 02:05:03.905
TALIESIN: Part of me wants to burn it on our way out.

02:05:03.905 --> 02:05:06.515
LAURA: Yeah?
TALIESIN: What do you think?

02:05:06.515 --> 02:05:08.835
Beau thinks it might make things worse.

02:05:10.249 --> 02:05:13.535
LAURA: I dunno, it seems pretty terrible.

02:05:13.535 --> 02:05:17.685
Maybe if we fly up and over it and we're coming out,

02:05:17.685 --> 02:05:20.585
I can send down some fire,

02:05:20.585 --> 02:05:22.745
maybe some radiant fire to take it out?

02:05:22.745 --> 02:05:25.015
It seems so evil.

02:05:26.821 --> 02:05:29.155
TALIESIN: I think just fire oughta do it.

02:05:29.155 --> 02:05:30.713
LAURA: Well, I can do that, too.

02:05:32.425 --> 02:05:33.825
TALIESIN: Is it--

02:05:34.975 --> 02:05:38.808
from what I remember when you talked to it,

02:05:38.808 --> 02:05:40.670
and when we tried to talk to it,

02:05:42.555 --> 02:05:44.035
it seemed like there was pain,

02:05:44.035 --> 02:05:46.866
if I recall.
LAURA: And hunger.

02:05:50.525 --> 02:05:52.275
TALIESIN: We've got to stay away from these things

02:05:52.275 --> 02:05:53.428
as much as possible.

02:05:54.615 --> 02:05:56.265
We've got to get out of here soon.

02:05:57.495 --> 02:05:58.328
LAURA: Yeah.

02:06:00.515 --> 02:06:01.645
MATT: While you're doing that, both of you,

02:06:01.645 --> 02:06:03.735
go ahead and roll perception checks for me, please.

02:06:03.735 --> 02:06:06.665
Who's taking the right side and who's taking the left?

02:06:06.665 --> 02:06:08.765
LIAM: I will take the left side.
MATT: All right.

02:06:11.095 --> 02:06:13.615
TRAVIS: Balls, five.
LIAM: 27.

02:06:13.615 --> 02:06:18.455
MATT: 27, okay. Fjord, as you
move along the right side, right?

02:06:18.455 --> 02:06:20.835
You're taking the right?
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

02:06:20.835 --> 02:06:23.435
MATT: You take a good long look around,

02:06:23.435 --> 02:06:25.685
your attention keeps being pulled towards the forest.

02:06:25.685 --> 02:06:28.558
You swear you're hearing movement,

02:06:28.558 --> 02:06:30.935
or just feeling something looking at you

02:06:30.935 --> 02:06:33.535
over in that direction, and you keep kind of--

02:06:35.727 --> 02:06:37.135
no, nothing.

02:06:37.135 --> 02:06:38.075
And you keep walking,

02:06:38.075 --> 02:06:39.565
and keep walking.
LAURA: Oh, I hate it.

02:06:39.565 --> 02:06:43.635
MATT: And it's just-- it's making you feel gross,

02:06:43.635 --> 02:06:45.065
like you just want to shower,

02:06:45.065 --> 02:06:47.985
in proximity to whatever this strange collection

02:06:47.985 --> 02:06:51.058
of unnatural forest would be.

02:06:52.745 --> 02:06:54.035
You do eventually come upon

02:06:54.035 --> 02:06:55.575
what looks to be a similar archway

02:06:55.575 --> 02:06:57.015
to the one that you guys had gone through

02:06:57.015 --> 02:06:59.675
to find where the vault was,

02:06:59.675 --> 02:07:02.115
but it is collapsed about 10 feet back in.

02:07:02.115 --> 02:07:03.325
You can see, it is filled with rubble

02:07:03.325 --> 02:07:04.905
and closed off entirely.

02:07:06.195 --> 02:07:08.745
You, moving along,

02:07:08.745 --> 02:07:12.298
find another hallway that continues onward.

02:07:13.195 --> 02:07:14.505
And as you continue,

02:07:14.505 --> 02:07:15.705
almost the same distance

02:07:15.705 --> 02:07:17.505
to the previous chamber you were in,

02:07:17.505 --> 02:07:21.038
you can see what looks to be another T intersection.

02:07:23.445 --> 02:07:25.355
LIAM: Well, I will stay away from that T intersection

02:07:25.355 --> 02:07:27.147
until I discuss with the group.

02:07:28.735 --> 02:07:30.845
So, that dipped out of the chamber,

02:07:30.845 --> 02:07:32.208
another hallway, another T.

02:07:34.765 --> 02:07:39.012
I Message to Beauregard and say,

02:07:39.012 --> 02:07:42.968
"I found another passage off to the left ahead,

02:07:42.968 --> 02:07:44.462
"but I'm going to keep moving around

02:07:44.462 --> 02:07:45.522
"to see if there is anything

02:07:45.522 --> 02:07:48.710
"on the opposing side from you all."

02:07:48.710 --> 02:07:50.815
So, I will exit there and keep going around.

02:07:50.815 --> 02:07:52.635
LAURA: You're just by yourself.
LIAM: Yes.

02:07:52.635 --> 02:07:56.225
LAURA: You're just by yourself, a little wizard,

02:07:56.225 --> 02:07:58.841
by yourself, wandering around.

02:07:58.841 --> 02:08:03.148
TALIESIN: Do we have like dun,
and dun, the four and the three?

02:08:03.148 --> 02:08:04.485
LIAM: But I did tell everyone where I was going.

02:08:04.485 --> 02:08:05.785
MARISHA: I relay the message.

02:08:05.785 --> 02:08:07.555
He found another passageway.

02:08:07.555 --> 02:08:08.815
TALIESIN: Let's head that way.

02:08:08.815 --> 02:08:10.885
Keep going around, not through the forest.

02:08:10.885 --> 02:08:13.185
Don't-- not into it.

02:08:13.185 --> 02:08:16.385
TALIESIN: As you step out of the hallway here,

02:08:16.385 --> 02:08:18.428
you look over, back towards the forest,

02:08:18.428 --> 02:08:23.045
and you feel that same kind of just odd draw,

02:08:23.045 --> 02:08:24.265
like something's over your shoulder.

02:08:24.265 --> 02:08:27.015
You keep catching yourself just flinching back,

02:08:27.925 --> 02:08:29.425
and there's nothing there.

02:08:31.715 --> 02:08:34.855
Continuing around, eventually you and Fjord meet each other

02:08:34.855 --> 02:08:35.688
on the opposite end.

02:08:35.688 --> 02:08:37.325
And this is a wide chamber,

02:08:37.325 --> 02:08:39.195
the perimeter of it is quite large to--

02:08:39.195 --> 02:08:41.355
it feels like you're walking along the outside

02:08:41.355 --> 02:08:43.985
of a legitimate underground small forest.

02:08:43.985 --> 02:08:46.695
But eventually, you do meet up and realize that you've--

02:08:46.695 --> 02:08:51.285
it looks to be almost like there are three exits

02:08:51.285 --> 02:08:53.005
that would have been from the central chamber,

02:08:53.005 --> 02:08:55.135
like a Y, if you will.

02:08:55.135 --> 02:08:56.715
One of which is entirely collapsed

02:08:56.715 --> 02:08:58.595
and the other two you've come across.

02:08:58.595 --> 02:09:00.145
LIAM: Okay.

02:09:00.145 --> 02:09:02.185
You getting the creepy crawlies in here?

02:09:02.185 --> 02:09:04.743
TRAVIS: Yeah, it feels like we're being watched.

02:09:04.743 --> 02:09:07.310
LIAM: Come on, I found a passageway and I call the others.

02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:08.655
So, I'll just double back to meet.

02:09:08.655 --> 02:09:11.176
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: We meet up in the middle.

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:14.378
MATT: You all eventually gather back at that third chamber.

02:09:16.035 --> 02:09:18.950
You come upon the same T intersection.

02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:19.783
What do you do?

02:09:19.783 --> 02:09:22.638
LIAM: Well, let's try what we tried before.

02:09:23.635 --> 02:09:27.290
I'll throw up Detect Magic.
MATT: Okay.

02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:28.723
LIAM: To see if the same is here.

02:09:30.085 --> 02:09:32.815
MATT: As you throw up Detect Magic,

02:09:32.815 --> 02:09:36.889
you can immediately sense the strong magical field

02:09:36.889 --> 02:09:38.915
that cuts off that hallway ahead of you,

02:09:38.915 --> 02:09:41.175
similar to the first chamber you came across.

02:09:41.175 --> 02:09:43.935
LIAM: Okay, Dispel at third.

02:09:43.935 --> 02:09:45.785
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a d20

02:09:45.785 --> 02:09:47.935
and add your intelligence modifier, please.

02:09:49.232 --> 02:09:52.140
LIAM: Balls.
LAURA: (laughs)

02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:53.701
I rolled a five.
SAM: Bless.

02:09:53.701 --> 02:09:55.241
LIAM: 10.
TRAVIS: Balls.

02:09:55.241 --> 02:09:58.675
MATT: All right, unfortunately, as the Dispel completes,

02:09:58.675 --> 02:09:59.845
you guys see a brief shimmer,

02:09:59.845 --> 02:10:03.968
like someone threw dust across a glass floor.

02:10:04.865 --> 02:10:06.265
And you can, for a brief second there,

02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:07.785
see the outer edge shimmering

02:10:07.785 --> 02:10:09.685
of this Wall of Force in front of you.

02:10:13.345 --> 02:10:14.978
LIAM: Well.
MARISHA: Did you do it?

02:10:16.145 --> 02:10:18.943
LIAM: No.
LAURA: Can you try again?

02:10:18.943 --> 02:10:20.968
LIAM: <i>Nein</i>.
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

02:10:22.005 --> 02:10:24.472
What about either of you?

02:10:24.472 --> 02:10:25.305
SAM: Do you have yours?

02:10:25.305 --> 02:10:26.766
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think.

02:10:28.125 --> 02:10:29.829
I don't think I used it, right?

02:10:29.829 --> 02:10:30.985
MARISHA: I don't think you did.

02:10:30.985 --> 02:10:33.745
ASHLEY: Let me double check to see if it is marked.

02:10:33.745 --> 02:10:36.068
LAURA: I mean, I can-- I-I-I--

02:10:36.068 --> 02:10:37.974
MATT: I believe you did last session.

02:10:37.974 --> 02:10:38.807
ASHLEY: I think I did.
LAURA: I have a couple

02:10:38.807 --> 02:10:40.875
third levels left. I'll try it as well.

02:10:40.875 --> 02:10:42.025
MARISHA: While they're talking about that,

02:10:42.025 --> 02:10:44.295
can I look at the archway above this hallway

02:10:44.295 --> 02:10:45.458
that we're going to go to?

02:10:45.458 --> 02:10:48.912
Is there a sign or writing above it?

02:10:48.912 --> 02:10:50.925
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

02:10:50.925 --> 02:10:52.595
MARISHA: Perception, not investigation?

02:10:52.595 --> 02:10:53.585
LAURA: That's okay, I already said it.

02:10:53.585 --> 02:10:55.135
LIAM: Yeah, you got it.

02:10:55.135 --> 02:11:00.125
MARISHA: Oh, oh, oh, that's good,
that's good, that's good, 23.

02:11:00.125 --> 02:11:02.055
MATT: 23, you look up at the ceiling above,

02:11:02.055 --> 02:11:03.325
and you can see the heavy cracks,

02:11:03.325 --> 02:11:04.645
structural damage that it's taken,

02:11:04.645 --> 02:11:06.012
but it's still holding okay.

02:11:06.012 --> 02:11:09.465
The arch design of this makes it fairly strong

02:11:09.465 --> 02:11:11.875
to hold any sort of above weight.

02:11:11.875 --> 02:11:13.685
So, while there is some structural damage,

02:11:13.685 --> 02:11:15.785
you don't feel any immediate danger of it collapsing

02:11:15.785 --> 02:11:17.345
or falling inward.

02:11:17.345 --> 02:11:19.385
You don't see any signs of any sort of writing or language

02:11:19.385 --> 02:11:20.875
at this moment and this juncture.

02:11:20.875 --> 02:11:22.965
LAURA: Was there any words on the outside of the archway

02:11:22.965 --> 02:11:24.315
like there was on the other archway?

02:11:24.315 --> 02:11:26.795
MARISHA: That's what I was just checking and he said no.

02:11:26.795 --> 02:11:27.705
LAURA: Oh, okay.
MATT: Oh.

02:11:27.705 --> 02:11:29.775
On the outside of the chamber you mean?

02:11:29.775 --> 02:11:31.785
MARISHA: Yeah, on the archway, yes.
MATT: Sorry, yes,

02:11:31.785 --> 02:11:33.585
you did see writing.
MARISHA: Oh, oh.

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:34.493
LAURA: Oh, so you would have seen it

02:11:34.493 --> 02:11:35.932
because you had Comprehend Languages up.
LIAM: Caleb would have been able to read them,

02:11:35.932 --> 02:11:38.213
because I have Comprehend up?
MATT: Correct.

02:11:38.213 --> 02:11:40.710
This says "Centurion Quarters."

02:11:40.710 --> 02:11:44.409
LIAM: Oh, this is where our robot came from.
LAURA: Oh, oh.

02:11:44.409 --> 02:11:45.592
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:11:45.592 --> 02:11:48.065
SAM: Oh, they have a bedroom, that's nice.

02:11:48.065 --> 02:11:50.995
LAURA: Do we want to waste-- Do we want to spend time here

02:11:50.995 --> 02:11:52.895
or do we want to try to get out?

02:11:52.895 --> 02:11:54.795
SAM: Well, we know that every moment we spend here,

02:11:54.795 --> 02:11:57.325
the baddies are getting closer and closer.

02:11:57.325 --> 02:11:58.645
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: So we should get out

02:11:58.645 --> 02:11:59.995
and get away.
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:11:59.995 --> 02:12:01.965
SAM: And the fastest way that we know to get out

02:12:01.965 --> 02:12:04.335
is through the forest of doom, but we're not going that way.

02:12:04.335 --> 02:12:06.485
LAURA: We can fly up and over it

02:12:06.485 --> 02:12:10.295
if anybody has spells that can do it.

02:12:10.295 --> 02:12:12.888
I don't have any left.
LIAM: I do.

02:12:13.745 --> 02:12:15.025
LAURA: For all of us?
LIAM: I have one last--

02:12:15.025 --> 02:12:17.255
well, I can shepherd us up--
TALIESIN: Up and down.

02:12:17.255 --> 02:12:18.185
LIAM: -- one at a time.

02:12:18.185 --> 02:12:20.425
MARISHA: How high was that, the way we came?

02:12:20.425 --> 02:12:22.045
It was like 30 feet or something, right?

02:12:22.045 --> 02:12:23.615
LAURA: It was like 80 feet.

02:12:23.615 --> 02:12:26.465
MATT: Oh, from the ceiling of this chamber

02:12:26.465 --> 02:12:31.298
where the rope dangled down from, that was about 100 feet.

02:12:32.391 --> 02:12:34.315
MARISHA: And we got the rope back, right?

02:12:34.315 --> 02:12:35.148
LAURA: No, the rope should still--

02:12:35.148 --> 02:12:38.948
MATT: The rope is dangling about 20,
30 feet from the top there.

02:12:38.948 --> 02:12:40.528
TALIESIN: Oh.
LAURA: So yeah, we should try it.

02:12:40.528 --> 02:12:43.695
MATT: Well, the top of the trees ends--

02:12:43.695 --> 02:12:45.575
the tallest tree that was there beneath it,

02:12:45.575 --> 02:12:48.065
20 feet below the rope.

02:12:48.065 --> 02:12:50.205
LAURA: But Caleb could fly from the ground level,

02:12:50.205 --> 02:12:52.508
around the forest, and up to the rope?

02:12:53.475 --> 02:12:54.645
Potentially?
MATT: Potentially, yeah.

02:12:54.645 --> 02:12:56.311
MARISHA: So we can get out the way we came.
LAURA: Okay, yeah,

02:12:56.311 --> 02:12:57.527
I think we should do that.

02:12:57.527 --> 02:13:01.615
LIAM: Yeah, I have have one four left, so I will owl it up,

02:13:01.615 --> 02:13:02.855
giant owl it up.

02:13:02.855 --> 02:13:05.745
SAM: So, we're specifically trying to not touch those trees?

02:13:05.745 --> 02:13:07.542
LAURA: Don't touch the trees, up and out.

02:13:07.542 --> 02:13:09.304
SAM: But nothing happened last time.

02:13:09.304 --> 02:13:11.535
We were on them.

02:13:11.535 --> 02:13:13.905
LAURA: I'll be the last one that you take, Caleb.

02:13:13.905 --> 02:13:14.738
LIAM: Okay.
MARISHA: You're right,

02:13:14.738 --> 02:13:16.615
we did smash through the branches of some trees.

02:13:16.615 --> 02:13:17.985
LAURA: Yeah, but I don't want to touch it now,

02:13:17.985 --> 02:13:19.545
now that I know what it's like.

02:13:19.545 --> 02:13:21.145
I don't want to touch them again.

02:13:21.145 --> 02:13:22.485
MARISHA: Fine with me.

02:13:22.485 --> 02:13:24.710
LAURA: I feel like they know us.

02:13:24.710 --> 02:13:26.226
I don't like it.
TALIESIN: I don't like it.

02:13:29.055 --> 02:13:31.605
Are we still going to have somewhere to sleep tonight?

02:13:33.275 --> 02:13:34.845
LIAM: Yes, a very comfortable dome.

02:13:34.845 --> 02:13:37.098
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

02:13:38.775 --> 02:13:39.842
LAURA: Up and out.
MARISHA: All right,

02:13:39.842 --> 02:13:41.055
let's get out.
LIAM: Okay, one at a time.

02:13:41.055 --> 02:13:43.415
I will take Veth first.

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:46.075
SAM: I mean, I can spider climb

02:13:46.075 --> 02:13:47.935
if you need it for other people,

02:13:47.935 --> 02:13:49.768
but if we have enough, if you can ferry us, then --

02:13:49.768 --> 02:13:50.601
LAURA: There's enough time, it's an hour.

02:13:50.601 --> 02:13:53.875
LIAM: It's an hour.
SAM: Great, so then take me.

02:13:53.875 --> 02:13:56.378
LAURA: Do I need to do anything to avoid tree, or--?

02:13:58.525 --> 02:14:00.025
MATT: Not necessarily, I mean,

02:14:00.025 --> 02:14:01.875
there's enough space between the edges of this chamber.

02:14:01.875 --> 02:14:04.675
If you're ferrying people up one-by-one to that rope,

02:14:04.675 --> 02:14:05.575
you could do so.

02:14:05.575 --> 02:14:07.155
LIAM: I will fly Veth all the way up

02:14:07.155 --> 02:14:12.155
to the very top of the chamber where
the rope goes into the ventilation shaft,

02:14:12.525 --> 02:14:15.385
so that she can be there to be our scout.

02:14:15.385 --> 02:14:20.132
And then I will go one at a time, starting with Beauregard,

02:14:20.132 --> 02:14:23.308
Yasha, Fjord, Caduceus, and end with Jester.

02:14:24.165 --> 02:14:25.723
MATT: Okay.

02:14:25.723 --> 02:14:29.073
One by one, you manage to, in your eagle form,

02:14:29.073 --> 02:14:32.508
lift them up and go over this darkened forest below.

02:14:33.355 --> 02:14:34.775
You have no light source

02:14:34.775 --> 02:14:36.955
beyond the individuals you are carrying.

02:14:36.955 --> 02:14:39.845
LIAM: I cast an owl, so the owl should be okay.

02:14:39.845 --> 02:14:42.275
MATT: Right, so you have darkvision,

02:14:42.275 --> 02:14:43.806
but I'm saying, from a visual standpoint,

02:14:43.806 --> 02:14:45.075
for those of you who do not have a light source,

02:14:45.075 --> 02:14:46.105
this darkened chamber,

02:14:46.105 --> 02:14:49.695
you are just being carried and guided through

02:14:49.695 --> 02:14:52.755
this subtle stale wind of the interior of this chamber,

02:14:52.755 --> 02:14:56.805
this nearly sealed interior has held,

02:14:56.805 --> 02:15:00.798
untouched by most for probably a millennia or more.

02:15:02.255 --> 02:15:05.095
Until one by one, you make your way up to the rope,

02:15:05.095 --> 02:15:08.485
heading up into the broken decline

02:15:08.485 --> 02:15:10.145
where you guys had originally descended

02:15:10.145 --> 02:15:12.005
into the ceiling of this chamber.

02:15:12.005 --> 02:15:15.846
LAURA: Before I leave--
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:15:15.846 --> 02:15:18.205
So, we're going to get to the rope,

02:15:18.205 --> 02:15:22.053
and I'm going to assume you have to drop your form.

02:15:22.053 --> 02:15:23.955
LIAM: Oh, if you are talking to me, yeah.

02:15:23.955 --> 02:15:26.345
LAURA: I mean, if you want to get up and out of that tunnel,

02:15:26.345 --> 02:15:28.105
you can't go up through as an owl.

02:15:28.105 --> 02:15:29.555
It's a tight tunnel.

02:15:29.555 --> 02:15:32.835
LIAM: Caleb recognizes the look in
her eye, and (poof) onto the rope.

02:15:32.835 --> 02:15:35.075
LAURA: So, the two of us are hanging from the rope,

02:15:35.075 --> 02:15:36.955
yes?
LIAM: Right, yeah.

02:15:36.955 --> 02:15:39.105
LAURA: That forest needs to be destroyed, Caleb.

02:15:40.025 --> 02:15:41.465
I dunno how much magic you have left,

02:15:41.465 --> 02:15:44.775
but I have one high level Fire Storm left,

02:15:44.775 --> 02:15:46.188
and I want to use it.

02:15:46.188 --> 02:15:48.995
TALIESIN: I don't think we need-- I assume I'm--

02:15:48.995 --> 02:15:50.775
because I would have been waiting for this.

02:15:50.775 --> 02:15:53.435
MATT: Well no, if you want to wait at this point,

02:15:53.435 --> 02:15:55.315
so you're waiting at the edge?

02:15:55.315 --> 02:15:56.745
TALIESIN: I would probably be in the tunnel

02:15:56.745 --> 02:15:58.145
because this is a conversation

02:15:58.145 --> 02:15:59.401
I would have wanted to be a part of.

02:15:59.401 --> 02:16:00.615
MATT: Okay, so you would have been on the rope

02:16:00.615 --> 02:16:02.505
and waiting for everyone else to go above.

02:16:02.505 --> 02:16:04.165
Because they're currently hanging from the rope.

02:16:04.165 --> 02:16:07.405
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, so yeah, I'm not there yet.
Never mind, that's fine.

02:16:07.405 --> 02:16:08.625
LAURA: You said you wanted to destroy it,

02:16:08.625 --> 02:16:10.134
I'm just going with what we talked about, Caduceus.

02:16:10.134 --> 02:16:11.935
TALIESIN: Definitely thinking about it, yeah.

02:16:13.075 --> 02:16:14.715
MATT: So, what are you doing?

02:16:14.715 --> 02:16:17.485
LIAM: I mean, I could, but you know what you're doing.

02:16:17.485 --> 02:16:20.125
LAURA: Okay, get ready to move, I guess.

02:16:20.125 --> 02:16:22.575
I don't know what these trees are going to do.

02:16:22.575 --> 02:16:24.435
TALIESIN: Wait, we haven't gotten everybody out yet.

02:16:24.435 --> 02:16:26.625
LAURA: Everybody's-- I'm assuming we're the last ones.

02:16:26.625 --> 02:16:27.936
Everybody's gone up the tunnel.

02:16:27.936 --> 02:16:30.284
LIAM: Hanging above us or in the tube.

02:16:30.284 --> 02:16:33.005
SAM: Is it easy to climb up the air conditioning shaft,

02:16:33.005 --> 02:16:34.658
or wait-- there is a rope, right?

02:16:34.658 --> 02:16:36.396
MATT: There is a rope you guys still have affixed.

02:16:36.396 --> 02:16:38.469
SAM: I'm going to just slowly start moving.

02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:40.533
MATT: Yeah, as you guys are all making it up there--

02:16:40.533 --> 02:16:45.215
I will say, with all of you all at once, in succession,

02:16:45.215 --> 02:16:46.625
heading up the rope--

02:16:46.625 --> 02:16:47.645
well, you're not all in succession

02:16:47.645 --> 02:16:49.625
because you've been ferrying them up, so yeah, no.

02:16:49.625 --> 02:16:51.869
There's no worry, continue.

02:16:51.869 --> 02:16:54.675
LIAM: You're going to go onto this rope, yeah?

02:16:54.675 --> 02:16:56.995
LAURA: Yeah, of course, so go up above me.

02:16:56.995 --> 02:16:58.698
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: I'll come up quickly.

02:17:00.415 --> 02:17:03.945
And I'm going to cast seventh level...

02:17:03.945 --> 02:17:05.511
SAM: Napalm.

02:17:07.012 --> 02:17:08.128
LAURA: Fire Storm.

02:17:08.128 --> 02:17:10.236
SAM: Yeah!

02:17:10.236 --> 02:17:11.761
LAURA: Into the forest below.

02:17:11.761 --> 02:17:14.265
TRAVIS: You have Fire Storm?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:17:14.265 --> 02:17:16.065
MATT: As you stand there, holding onto the rope,

02:17:16.065 --> 02:17:19.105
just on the lip of the bent metal shaft

02:17:19.105 --> 02:17:21.195
that you had all climbed down through,

02:17:21.195 --> 02:17:24.845
you glance down, clutch your symbol of the Traveler,

02:17:24.845 --> 02:17:28.098
and look down at this extremely malevolent space beneath.

02:17:29.865 --> 02:17:33.845
And with a nod, you watch as-- (flames whooshing)

02:17:33.845 --> 02:17:35.805
this circle of bright radiant flame

02:17:35.805 --> 02:17:38.755
just suddenly burns and travels beneath the canopy.

02:17:38.755 --> 02:17:41.925
It's almost like this burning ember of an underlight.

02:17:41.925 --> 02:17:43.595
And as it immediately bursts up,

02:17:43.595 --> 02:17:48.008
you see flames begin to catch, and swell, and expand.

02:17:48.008 --> 02:17:51.895
This is going to be a raging forest fire very soon.

02:17:51.895 --> 02:17:54.577
And with that, smoke begins to rise up,

02:17:54.577 --> 02:17:56.270
and you begin to climb up.

02:17:57.735 --> 02:18:02.405
As you get within this chamber, partway in,

02:18:02.405 --> 02:18:04.185
climbing to meet the rest of your friends

02:18:04.185 --> 02:18:06.835
who are all currently up in the laboratory chambers

02:18:06.835 --> 02:18:08.185
where they're awaiting you,

02:18:09.185 --> 02:18:11.435
you hear this sound.

02:18:11.435 --> 02:18:12.635
This faint...

02:18:15.393 --> 02:18:18.359
echoing screeching, this--

02:18:19.459 --> 02:18:24.392
(creaking, screeches)

02:18:25.226 --> 02:18:27.935
But dozens of them,

02:18:27.935 --> 02:18:32.441
shifting and screaming, horrible.

02:18:35.795 --> 02:18:38.368
You don't know what they're coming from,

02:18:41.215 --> 02:18:43.073
but they're shrieks of...

02:18:44.739 --> 02:18:46.572
fear, pain,

02:18:49.013 --> 02:18:50.163
who knows.

02:18:51.535 --> 02:18:53.545
By the time you finish that thought,

02:18:53.545 --> 02:18:58.545
you catch yourself coughing because this domed chamber

02:18:58.665 --> 02:19:00.865
that currently holds a forest fire

02:19:00.865 --> 02:19:05.175
is now pumping smoke directly into this tiny flue

02:19:05.175 --> 02:19:06.325
that you are climbing through.

02:19:06.325 --> 02:19:07.748
SAM: We're all idiots.

02:19:08.725 --> 02:19:12.516
MATT: So, as Jester and Caleb--
SAM: (hacking coughing)

02:19:12.516 --> 02:19:14.785
MATT: -- begin making their way up.
LAURA: Everybody else has gone.

02:19:14.785 --> 02:19:17.378
MATT: You guys are standing up there waiting for them

02:19:17.378 --> 02:19:18.615
and you just watch black smoke

02:19:18.615 --> 02:19:20.605
start pouring out.
TALIESIN: I would be pulling.

02:19:20.605 --> 02:19:22.365
MATT: You guys start pulling the rope and helping them up,

02:19:22.365 --> 02:19:24.708
and eventually you drag them back out.

02:19:25.675 --> 02:19:27.125
MATT: How long does your Spiritual Guardian last for?

02:19:27.125 --> 02:19:28.185
TALIESIN: A long time.
MATT: Yeah, eight hours?

02:19:28.185 --> 02:19:29.335
It's still floating there,

02:19:29.335 --> 02:19:34.335
this radiant image of a celestial, translucent warrior

02:19:34.535 --> 02:19:36.975
in curled leaf and vine armor,

02:19:36.975 --> 02:19:39.015
this faint greenish glow to it,

02:19:39.015 --> 02:19:43.535
this feathered crown upon this not quite there head.

02:19:43.535 --> 02:19:46.318
TALIESIN: Yeah, weird crystally thing.
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:19:46.318 --> 02:19:48.475
TRAVIS: Hell yes.
TALIESIN: No head.

02:19:48.475 --> 02:19:50.665
MATT: And eventually, you all manage
to catch up into this chamber.

02:19:50.665 --> 02:19:52.695
LIAM: Caleb would have-- just to rewind a second,

02:19:52.695 --> 02:19:55.615
would have waited at the edge of that entrance and watched.

02:19:55.615 --> 02:19:57.525
And like the fire bug he is,

02:19:57.525 --> 02:20:01.245
would have just stared at it all

02:20:01.245 --> 02:20:02.826
until the smoke overwhelmed.

02:20:02.826 --> 02:20:05.017
LAURA: Until I pushed your butt.
LIAM: And you swatted his ass.

02:20:05.017 --> 02:20:07.295
LAURA: Get out, get out.
LIAM: Absolutely. Absolutely.

02:20:07.295 --> 02:20:10.575
MATT: All righty, as you all reconvene,

02:20:10.575 --> 02:20:12.845
you, knowing exactly what transpired,

02:20:12.845 --> 02:20:15.388
and you feel however you feel about that.

02:20:16.225 --> 02:20:17.115
There's that quiet moment

02:20:17.115 --> 02:20:19.945
as you all begin to hear those dozens,

02:20:19.945 --> 02:20:22.765
now almost hundreds of screeching voices,

02:20:22.765 --> 02:20:27.325
echoing, and the reverb giving this weird

02:20:27.325 --> 02:20:32.325
discordant resonance to this sound of something,

02:20:32.583 --> 02:20:34.385
something dying.

02:20:34.385 --> 02:20:36.555
LAURA: They weren't going to be saved.

02:20:36.555 --> 02:20:37.921
TALIESIN: There was--

02:20:41.221 --> 02:20:45.955
this was-- this was closest to kindness.

02:20:45.955 --> 02:20:48.648
That was not okay.

02:20:51.871 --> 02:20:53.129
We should go.

02:20:55.301 --> 02:20:59.908
MATT: You all take a beat, look about the surroundings,

02:21:01.579 --> 02:21:02.785
and begin to continue your trek

02:21:02.785 --> 02:21:06.905
out of this portion of the fallen Aeor ruin.

02:21:06.905 --> 02:21:09.496
We're going to take a break.
MARISHA: (groans)

02:21:09.496 --> 02:21:10.511
MATT: Be back here in a few minutes.

02:21:10.511 --> 02:21:13.444
LIAM: Good shit.
ASHLEY: (groans)

02:21:13.444 --> 02:21:14.395
TRAVIS: What the fuck are those?

02:21:14.395 --> 02:21:16.338
MARISHA: I don't know.
LAURA: I want to know.

02:21:16.338 --> 02:21:17.673
MARISHA: Was it the trees?

02:21:17.673 --> 02:21:21.338
LAURA: Oh, it was definitely the trees.
TRAVIS: Had to be. Or something in the tree trunk?

02:21:21.338 --> 02:21:23.605
LAURA: Those trees were alive!
TALIESIN: The trees were alive and--

02:21:23.605 --> 02:21:26.195
they were not-- they were weird, they were weird.

02:21:26.195 --> 02:21:27.638
ASHLEY: Alive as something.

02:21:29.341 --> 02:21:32.765
LAURA: Can you take your Spiritual Guardian--

02:21:32.765 --> 02:21:34.902
can it come with us?

02:21:34.902 --> 02:21:36.775
TALIESIN: I'm just going to cancel it

02:21:36.775 --> 02:21:41.225
once we're at the entrance of the--

02:21:41.225 --> 02:21:43.182
I'm just going to make our traces go away.

02:21:43.182 --> 02:21:44.373
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:21:45.798 --> 02:21:46.635
MATT: Okay.

02:21:46.635 --> 02:21:48.075
TRAVIS: Minus the black smoke portion.

02:21:48.075 --> 02:21:50.838
LAURA: Yeah, oh yeah, we're definitely going to be seen.

02:21:51.895 --> 02:21:54.392
MATT: But nevertheless, we'll see you here in a few minutes.

02:21:54.392 --> 02:21:55.979
TALIESIN: (sighs)

02:21:56.407 --> 02:21:59.740
(calm orchestral music)

02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:29.930
Wow.

02:22:29.930 --> 02:22:31.610
Oh god.

02:22:31.610 --> 02:22:32.443
Cool.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.279
Oh god! Oh, Brian, Brian, Brian!

02:22:37.279 --> 02:22:40.029
(women laughing)

02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:45.317
What is happening?

02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:49.247
This is worse than the last time.

02:22:49.247 --> 02:22:50.547
No no no no no, hold on.

02:22:52.210 --> 02:22:54.533
Are we on the internet?

02:22:56.390 --> 02:22:59.876
Yes! It's our final show of 2020!

02:22:59.876 --> 02:23:01.980
Oh!
Yay!

02:23:01.980 --> 02:23:05.980
Oh god, okay, I'm so glad you clarified that,

02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:08.210
'cause when you said final show,

02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:11.850
I thought you meant this was gonna be our final show.

02:23:11.850 --> 02:23:13.070
Scared me for a second there.

02:23:13.070 --> 02:23:15.982
Well, I mean, it could be our final show.

02:23:15.982 --> 02:23:17.284
It could be.

02:23:17.284 --> 02:23:19.750
It really just depends on how just awful your jokes are.

02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:20.863
My jokes?

02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:23.480
How is so much riding on my jokes?

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:25.480
Okay, okay, there's no way.

02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:26.313
It's all riding on your jokes.

02:23:26.313 --> 02:23:29.080
There's no way, ladies. Here, I've got one for you.

02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:30.790
Knock knock.

02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:32.480
Who's there?

02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:36.470
Okay, a naked horse walks into an opium den.

02:23:36.470 --> 02:23:38.365
Nope. No no no, no, no, nope.

02:23:38.365 --> 02:23:40.516
A naked horse walks into an opium den who?

02:23:40.516 --> 02:23:42.628
No, intro. Intro time.

02:23:42.628 --> 02:23:44.970
Overruled by Dani.

02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:47.480
It was the night before Winter's Crest.

02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:49.725
And all through the Xhorhaus.

02:23:49.725 --> 02:23:53.250
All the creatures, all the Mighty Nein was stirring.

02:23:53.250 --> 02:23:55.942
Not a creature was stirring.

02:23:55.942 --> 02:24:00.942
The Mighty Nein was stirring. Even a little mouse.

02:24:03.350 --> 02:24:04.523
It can't be mouse.

02:24:06.225 --> 02:24:08.725
(chill music)

02:24:22.690 --> 02:24:24.810
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:24:24.810 --> 02:24:27.253
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:24:28.498 --> 02:24:33.333
Ooh, look at this, look at the details, ooh.

02:24:35.125 --> 02:24:39.173
Roll an investigation if you want, it's basically perfect.

02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:44.183
This holiday season, give the gift of effortless style.

02:24:46.021 --> 02:24:49.353
These holidays, you know, they're just around the corner.

02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:53.680
This is a lot of stuff, you guys,

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:56.273
we have like so many cool things right now.

02:24:59.086 --> 02:25:01.953
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:07.864
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:25:07.864 --> 02:25:10.160
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:11.110
You still got time.

02:25:14.698 --> 02:25:17.198
(smooth jazz)

02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:19.620
Hello, everyone.

02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:22.040
It's me, Marisha Ray,

02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:24.800
creative director for Critical Role content,

02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:26.910
and I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:30.000
about how much we appreciate your support.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:34.390
No frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

02:25:34.390 --> 02:25:36.100
Over the past five years we've made

02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:38.950
a lot of ridiculous promos in an attempt

02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:41.670
to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:45.840
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor, cheap costumes,

02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:48.230
and putting our loyal employees in slightly

02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:50.490
embarrassing situations eagerly hoping that

02:25:50.490 --> 02:25:52.720
we've captured your attention.

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:56.210
Today I am not resorting to edgelord jokes

02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:58.780
written by Brian W. Foster,

02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:01.700
or dressing Sam as a celebrity to recreate

02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:04.710
an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:07.670
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account

02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:10.490
requires you to resubscribe each month.

02:26:10.490 --> 02:26:13.860
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:16.600
or have to put Matt in cosplay to tell you that

02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:19.420
you can easily gift subscriptions to fellow Critters

02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:21.140
if you're feeling generous.

02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:21.990
I mean hell,

02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:25.380
I've consumed entire production days shooting

02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:28.390
complicated parody promos featuring Taliesin Jaffe

02:26:28.390 --> 02:26:32.370
as a vintage spooky boy in full monochromatic glory,

02:26:32.370 --> 02:26:36.263
all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub.

02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:38.493
But not today.

02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:44.193
No weird graphics, no puppet murder, no Sam Riegel.

02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:53.933
It's just me, here to say thank you.

02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:57.163
Love you all. Goodnight.

02:40:03.878 --> 02:40:05.464
MATT: And welcome back.

02:40:05.464 --> 02:40:09.804
So as you all had just finished ascending

02:40:09.804 --> 02:40:14.234
the subterranean duct that led to the now burning forest

02:40:14.234 --> 02:40:15.657
beneath the laboratory,

02:40:16.514 --> 02:40:21.144
you all took stock of a successful delve thus far

02:40:21.144 --> 02:40:22.537
into here, A2.

02:40:24.054 --> 02:40:29.054
And now you stand in the center of this quiet, darkened,

02:40:29.184 --> 02:40:32.394
half-collapsed laboratory chamber,

02:40:32.394 --> 02:40:36.423
where behind you, not but 20 feet, there are numerous,

02:40:36.423 --> 02:40:39.020
large, liquid-filled glass tubes were living beings

02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:42.041
occasionally twitch from within. What do you do?

02:40:42.041 --> 02:40:44.641
LAURA: Keep going. We keep going. We leave.

02:40:44.641 --> 02:40:48.354
MATT: Okay. You all head back down the long hallway,

02:40:48.354 --> 02:40:51.244
eventually curving over into the chamber

02:40:51.244 --> 02:40:55.584
where you've battled the cherub-faced lure abomination.

02:40:55.584 --> 02:40:57.984
Its body is still on its side there.

02:40:57.984 --> 02:41:00.224
The smell awful in the chamber,

02:41:00.224 --> 02:41:03.161
as it's expressed whatever it needed to in death.

02:41:03.161 --> 02:41:05.936
SAM: Ew.
(laughter)

02:41:05.936 --> 02:41:08.434
TRAVIS: "Expressed whatever it needed to."

02:41:08.434 --> 02:41:09.400
LIAM: Its feelings.

02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:11.404
MATT: Yeah, its feelings.

02:41:11.404 --> 02:41:14.984
But you head to the opposite entrance portion

02:41:14.984 --> 02:41:18.574
and that door's now back out of its wedge,

02:41:18.574 --> 02:41:21.214
where you previously found it upon arriving.

02:41:22.074 --> 02:41:24.951
SAM: It's out of its wedge, meaning someone moved it?

02:41:24.951 --> 02:41:26.167
LAURA: Oh, that's right.
SAM: Or it's where we left it.

02:41:26.167 --> 02:41:27.533
MATT: Impacted and slipped out of it this mooring

02:41:27.533 --> 02:41:28.366
and it's locked.

02:41:28.366 --> 02:41:29.374
SAM: We got to get through it again.

02:41:29.374 --> 02:41:30.582
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: The screen door--

02:41:30.582 --> 02:41:33.539
ASHLEY: Should we try to just get it back up again?

02:41:33.539 --> 02:41:34.484
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it.

02:41:34.484 --> 02:41:35.464
ASHLEY: Yeah, ready?

02:41:35.464 --> 02:41:37.304
LAURA: One, two, three.

02:41:37.304 --> 02:41:39.162
MATT: You both can roll or one of
you can roll with advantage.

02:41:39.162 --> 02:41:40.164
LAURA: Let's both roll.

02:41:40.164 --> 02:41:40.997
ASHLEY: Let's both roll.

02:41:40.997 --> 02:41:41.953
MARISHA: Smooth.

02:41:41.953 --> 02:41:43.253
ASHLEY: The way I'm rolling tonight.
LAURA: Guidance!

02:41:43.253 --> 02:41:45.986
ASHLEY: Guidance? Oh.
LAURA: Oh, I guided you.

02:41:47.034 --> 02:41:49.469
ASHLEY: You guided me?
SAM: Is that true?

02:41:49.469 --> 02:41:51.175
MATT: Nope, nope.

02:41:51.175 --> 02:41:52.935
LAURA: I guided myself, I'm sorry.

02:41:52.935 --> 02:41:54.401
ASHLEY: No, I--

02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:58.059
Hopefully, you guided well.
TRAVIS: That didn't help you, did it.

02:41:58.059 --> 02:42:00.182
LAURA: Nope.

02:42:00.182 --> 02:42:01.102
11.

02:42:03.519 --> 02:42:04.440
ASHLEY: 13.

02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:05.273
MATT: 13.

02:42:05.273 --> 02:42:08.621
You both, exhausted, sore from the series of battles

02:42:08.621 --> 02:42:13.291
you've suffered in climbing up from this subterranean space.

02:42:13.291 --> 02:42:14.252
It is not moving.

02:42:14.252 --> 02:42:17.274
In fact, it's more wedged now than it was when you found it.

02:42:17.274 --> 02:42:19.224
And it is, like, locked at an angle.

02:42:19.224 --> 02:42:21.816
Part of its mooring is slightly cracked and off-kilter.

02:42:21.816 --> 02:42:23.642
It's not moving.

02:42:23.642 --> 02:42:26.186
TRAVIS: Caleb, you want to show them
how it's done, you and me?

02:42:26.186 --> 02:42:27.269
LAURA: It's--

02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:30.098
SAM: Good idea. Come on, boys.
LIAM: Yeah, I will assist you.

02:42:30.098 --> 02:42:31.264
TRAVIS: Yeah, Caleb, let's go.

02:42:31.264 --> 02:42:32.444
LIAM: I will assist you.

02:42:32.444 --> 02:42:33.552
TRAVIS: It's just that you've done so much.

02:42:33.552 --> 02:42:34.664
LAURA: Hey, Fjord?
TRAVIS: Hmm?

02:42:34.664 --> 02:42:36.089
ASHLEY: Give it a go. You can do it.
LAURA: Guidance.

02:42:36.089 --> 02:42:36.922
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:42:36.922 --> 02:42:38.391
ASHLEY: You've been doing your reps with Beau.

02:42:38.391 --> 02:42:39.234
LIAM: Lift with the legs.

02:42:39.234 --> 02:42:40.900
TRAVIS: Yep.
LIAM: That's my part.

02:42:40.900 --> 02:42:43.494
TRAVIS: What, that's it?
LIAM: Here we go (grunts).

02:42:43.494 --> 02:42:44.560
TRAVIS: We both roll.

02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:46.510
MATT: All right. Both of you guys roll strength checks.

02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:51.510
MARISHA: I pass Nott's flask over to Yasha, as we watch.

02:42:51.899 --> 02:42:53.399
TRAVIS: That's good. Where the hell did my d4 go?

02:42:53.399 --> 02:42:54.426
There he is.

02:42:55.275 --> 02:42:56.366
LIAM: Made about what you'd expect.

02:42:56.366 --> 02:42:57.266
TRAVIS: 22!

02:42:57.266 --> 02:43:00.037
SAM: Ooh, hoo hoo hoo!
ASHLEY: Okay!

02:43:00.037 --> 02:43:02.344
LIAM: <i>Dreizehn.</i> 13.

02:43:02.344 --> 02:43:04.444
LAURA: You did better than I did (laughs).
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

02:43:04.444 --> 02:43:05.794
MATT: As both Caleb and Fjord

02:43:05.794 --> 02:43:09.434
get down, fingers beneath the wedge and they strain,

02:43:09.434 --> 02:43:12.004
the exhausted women who had just done it before, themselves

02:43:12.004 --> 02:43:16.295
taken, you know, a heavy brunt of this initial work.

02:43:16.295 --> 02:43:18.099
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:43:18.099 --> 02:43:22.634
MATT: Veth, you are surprised to see the statuesque figure

02:43:22.634 --> 02:43:26.244
of Fjord Stone (grunts) flexing his muscles,

02:43:26.244 --> 02:43:28.983
bulging, lifting this as it creaks.

02:43:28.983 --> 02:43:30.694
(creaking)

02:43:30.694 --> 02:43:34.264
Slides into the mooring, then (chains rattling),

02:43:34.264 --> 02:43:37.314
lifts itself back up, the previous doorway closing behind.

02:43:37.314 --> 02:43:40.070
ASHLEY: Clearly, we loosened it for you, but, you know.

02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:43.561
LAURA: I'm saving that mental image
from my sketchbook later.

02:43:43.561 --> 02:43:44.444
SAM: That was amazing!

02:43:44.444 --> 02:43:45.751
Did you strain anything?

02:43:45.751 --> 02:43:46.844
Did anything tweak?

02:43:46.844 --> 02:43:49.074
TRAVIS: I think I gave myself a new hernia.

02:43:49.074 --> 02:43:51.351
(laughter)
SAM: A new hernia.

02:43:51.351 --> 02:43:54.944
TRAVIS: I got one hold and
that's the bulge on the other side.

02:43:54.944 --> 02:43:57.066
LIAM: Yeah, I just go and I give it a little (dings)

02:43:57.066 --> 02:43:59.314
pop it right in.

02:43:59.314 --> 02:44:00.828
TRAVIS: That's good.
LIAM: Right as rain.

02:44:00.828 --> 02:44:03.017
TRAVIS: It's warm. We should go.

02:44:03.017 --> 02:44:03.944
It's spreading.

02:44:03.944 --> 02:44:05.954
ASHLEY: I see you've been doing your reps with Beau.

02:44:05.954 --> 02:44:07.574
You can see, stronger.

02:44:07.574 --> 02:44:09.893
TRAVIS: The inverted sit-ups are A-plus.

02:44:09.893 --> 02:44:11.574
ASHLEY: Ah.

02:44:11.574 --> 02:44:12.501
MARISHA: Proud of you.

02:44:15.264 --> 02:44:19.158
MATT: Slowly, you all return to the--

02:44:19.158 --> 02:44:20.964
head through this chamber, heading towards

02:44:20.964 --> 02:44:25.094
the open doorway that you had originally pulled forward

02:44:25.094 --> 02:44:27.854
to expose this chamber, and you head into

02:44:27.854 --> 02:44:31.384
the cold, subterranean opening

02:44:31.384 --> 02:44:33.304
where you had first descended into this.

02:44:33.304 --> 02:44:35.614
You can see the ground still covered

02:44:35.614 --> 02:44:37.944
in a layer of rubble and shale,

02:44:37.944 --> 02:44:38.777
and ice chips.

02:44:40.464 --> 02:44:42.913
ASHLEY: Is he in here?

02:44:42.913 --> 02:44:45.564
SAM: Is it Iver, Ivver, Iver?

02:44:45.564 --> 02:44:46.814
MATT: You don't see anything.

02:44:48.089 --> 02:44:50.104
And there was no light from above, by the way.

02:44:50.104 --> 02:44:52.109
Night has come.

02:44:52.109 --> 02:44:53.524
SAM: Iver?
TALIESIN: Iver?

02:44:53.524 --> 02:44:55.034
SAM: You around?

02:44:55.034 --> 02:44:56.034
LIAM: A little bit of fire in my hand.

02:44:56.034 --> 02:44:57.354
TALIESIN: Iver?

02:44:57.354 --> 02:44:58.977
SAM: It's us, you can show yourself.

02:45:00.194 --> 02:45:01.444
MATT: There's a slight pause.

02:45:04.284 --> 02:45:05.214
"Hello?"

02:45:05.214 --> 02:45:06.214
TALIESIN: Hey.

02:45:06.214 --> 02:45:08.550
MATT: "Sorry. I was hiding.

02:45:08.550 --> 02:45:11.714
"So everything went well, hopefully?"

02:45:11.714 --> 02:45:13.594
TALIESIN: Well, we didn't find what we were looking for,

02:45:13.594 --> 02:45:15.264
but we feel confident we're going to find it

02:45:15.264 --> 02:45:16.603
in the next site.

02:45:16.603 --> 02:45:17.811
SAM: Ho, ho ho!

02:45:17.811 --> 02:45:19.068
MATT: Make a deception check, please.

02:45:19.068 --> 02:45:22.398
MARISHA: Has Caduceus ever had to make a deception check?

02:45:22.398 --> 02:45:24.571
TRAVIS: The trees fucked his shit up!

02:45:24.571 --> 02:45:25.404
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:45:25.404 --> 02:45:26.270
TALIESIN: Nine.

02:45:26.270 --> 02:45:28.353
(laughter)

02:45:31.304 --> 02:45:32.565
MATT: He just stabs you-- no.

02:45:32.565 --> 02:45:34.991
TALIESIN: Ow!
(laughter)

02:45:34.991 --> 02:45:36.981
TRAVIS: There's a reason I don't do this!

02:45:36.981 --> 02:45:38.906
MATT: He just goes, "Huh."

02:45:41.414 --> 02:45:42.247
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:45:45.187 --> 02:45:46.304
MATT: "Very well, then.

02:45:49.014 --> 02:45:53.084
"Did you have any luck coming upon my comrades?"

02:45:53.084 --> 02:45:53.917
SAM: Oh.

02:45:53.917 --> 02:45:57.184
LAURA: Oh, that we did find.

02:45:57.184 --> 02:45:59.967
SAM: Just to make sure,

02:45:59.967 --> 02:46:01.694
maybe describe them?

02:46:01.694 --> 02:46:06.094
We saw some fallen bodies down there and we don't,

02:46:06.094 --> 02:46:08.774
we can't be sure they're your friends.

02:46:08.774 --> 02:46:11.654
MATT: And you see now eyes look extremely untrusting.

02:46:11.654 --> 02:46:14.004
The combination of reading a lie out of the gate

02:46:14.004 --> 02:46:15.884
and not finding his friends.

02:46:15.884 --> 02:46:18.634
You can already see the math in his head going

02:46:18.634 --> 02:46:20.171
and he just begins to step back a little bit.

02:46:20.171 --> 02:46:22.574
TALIESIN: Did we take anything to prove?

02:46:22.574 --> 02:46:24.054
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Yes.

02:46:24.054 --> 02:46:25.987
SAM: It wasn't us. We didn't--

02:46:25.987 --> 02:46:27.744
LAURA: We didn't-- There was a creature.

02:46:27.744 --> 02:46:28.904
TALIESIN: The big baby.

02:46:28.904 --> 02:46:30.444
ASHLEY: That thing that you were hearing.

02:46:30.444 --> 02:46:32.224
Remember when you got scared and you were like,

02:46:32.224 --> 02:46:34.244
"It's a scary noise"?

02:46:34.244 --> 02:46:35.444
It was very scary.

02:46:35.444 --> 02:46:36.647
TALIESIN: It was a big baby.

02:46:36.647 --> 02:46:39.774
LAURA: And your friends came upon it.

02:46:39.774 --> 02:46:41.384
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:46:41.384 --> 02:46:42.719
SAM: Yeah. We didn't kill your friends.

02:46:42.719 --> 02:46:44.151
It was a large baby.

02:46:44.151 --> 02:46:45.184
(laughter)

02:46:45.184 --> 02:46:46.017
Believe us.

02:46:47.364 --> 02:46:48.554
TRAVIS: It kind of looked like this.

02:46:48.554 --> 02:46:51.434
And I use a Mask of Many Faces and be like (screams).

02:46:51.434 --> 02:46:53.784
LAURA: Do I have advantage on it because everybody else

02:46:53.784 --> 02:46:55.221
is talking to him?

02:46:55.221 --> 02:46:56.529
MATT: No.
LAURA: Just me?

02:46:56.529 --> 02:46:58.834
MATT: You're not getting disadvantage

02:46:58.834 --> 02:47:00.214
because everyone's talking with you,

02:47:00.214 --> 02:47:02.424
because he, right now, does not trust you at all.

02:47:02.424 --> 02:47:05.297
LAURA: Well, I rolled a one, so.

02:47:05.297 --> 02:47:06.130
(laughter)

02:47:06.130 --> 02:47:07.830
SAM: Shit, we're going to have to kill this guy.

02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:09.134
ASHLEY: I--

02:47:09.134 --> 02:47:10.451
MATT: Roll initiative. No.

02:47:11.552 --> 02:47:14.214
ASHLEY: I'm going to pull out the bone from the baby.

02:47:14.214 --> 02:47:15.330
That's still kind of--
SAM: The what?

02:47:15.330 --> 02:47:16.180
LAURA: Oh.

02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:17.434
ASHLEY: I took some of the bones.

02:47:17.434 --> 02:47:19.754
LAURA: Yeah, that's right, the back bone.
ASHLEY: This was from the thing.

02:47:19.754 --> 02:47:20.604
SAM: The baby.

02:47:20.604 --> 02:47:21.957
That's a bone of a baby.

02:47:22.824 --> 02:47:23.657
TALIESIN: This place is weird.

02:47:23.657 --> 02:47:25.604
MATT: "Look just go, just get out of here."

02:47:25.604 --> 02:47:26.784
ASHLEY: Wait, are you stuck here?

02:47:26.784 --> 02:47:27.739
Do you want to stay?

02:47:27.739 --> 02:47:28.939
SAM: You can't stay here.

02:47:28.939 --> 02:47:29.772
You have to go.

02:47:29.772 --> 02:47:30.605
MARISHA: They're not coming back.

02:47:30.605 --> 02:47:32.782
We found a half-elven woman corpse.

02:47:32.782 --> 02:47:36.754
It's the woman you came with, as well as a few other bodies.

02:47:36.754 --> 02:47:40.834
They're being digested in the corpse

02:47:40.834 --> 02:47:41.886
of a giant baby right now.

02:47:41.886 --> 02:47:44.381
LAURA: Seriously, you can go down that hallway and see it.

02:47:44.381 --> 02:47:46.474
TRAVIS: But it's dangerous. You risk--

02:47:47.324 --> 02:47:48.554
TALIESIN: There's still some weird stuff.

02:47:48.554 --> 02:47:50.470
And it might be on fire.

02:47:50.470 --> 02:47:53.754
LAURA: And, yeah, it might burn down soon.

02:47:53.754 --> 02:47:54.694
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:47:54.694 --> 02:47:56.514
LAURA: This place is fucked.
TRAVIS: You're welcome to,

02:47:56.514 --> 02:47:58.654
but we would be remiss if we didn't try

02:47:58.654 --> 02:48:00.494
and steer you towards safety.

02:48:00.494 --> 02:48:01.544
LIAM: Here's the other thing,

02:48:01.544 --> 02:48:05.604
we know that there are other parties coming here.

02:48:05.604 --> 02:48:07.094
And it is not safe for you.

02:48:07.094 --> 02:48:07.927
Yeah.

02:48:07.927 --> 02:48:11.124
So we can see in your eyes, you're having a hard time

02:48:11.124 --> 02:48:15.814
with us, but we can offer you about as safe a harbor

02:48:15.814 --> 02:48:18.494
tonight as you're going to find on your own.

02:48:18.494 --> 02:48:20.034
MATT: And he starts walking away

02:48:20.034 --> 02:48:22.297
and then you hear some shuffling,

02:48:24.004 --> 02:48:25.814
some movement of something heavy.

02:48:25.814 --> 02:48:28.704
A pan goes like (clanking noise).

02:48:28.704 --> 02:48:30.534
Eventually, he comes back with a pack over his shoulder

02:48:30.534 --> 02:48:32.384
and goes,

02:48:33.908 --> 02:48:35.824
"Wide berth, please."

02:48:35.824 --> 02:48:37.382
And he just starts climbing quickly.

02:48:37.382 --> 02:48:39.834
Just skittering up the rope to get away from you all.

02:48:39.834 --> 02:48:43.069
He is very much not convinced that you didn't kill his

02:48:43.069 --> 02:48:44.611
compatriots for treasure.

02:48:44.611 --> 02:48:47.754
MARISHA: Does anyone got any
ability to modify this guy's memory?

02:48:47.754 --> 02:48:50.329
LAURA: Oh yeah. I just used all my spells, so.

02:48:50.329 --> 02:48:52.674
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

02:48:52.674 --> 02:48:54.654
LAURA: Yeah. If you want to, like--

02:48:54.654 --> 02:48:55.487
MARISHA: Kill him?

02:48:55.487 --> 02:48:57.094
LAURA: Or like tie him up or something,

02:48:57.094 --> 02:48:59.077
I can wipe his memory in the morning.

02:48:59.077 --> 02:49:00.986
I just can't do it now.

02:49:00.986 --> 02:49:03.544
Grab him. I can wipe his memory in the morning.

02:49:03.544 --> 02:49:05.397
MARISHA: How far up is he? Can I grab him?

02:49:05.397 --> 02:49:07.344
MATT: Right now he's about 60, 70 feet.

02:49:07.344 --> 02:49:08.184
LIAM: Oh, that's--

02:49:08.184 --> 02:49:09.024
TALIESIN: No, let's just--

02:49:09.024 --> 02:49:09.984
LAURA: Grab him at the top, Beau.

02:49:09.984 --> 02:49:11.284
We'll go up.
MARISHA: I'll grab him at the top.

02:49:11.284 --> 02:49:13.014
SAM: I will say, he's dangerous to us.

02:49:13.014 --> 02:49:13.984
He could go back to the--

02:49:13.984 --> 02:49:18.014
MARISHA: Exactly. We need to wipe his
memory before he goes anywhere.

02:49:18.014 --> 02:49:18.847
SAM: He's a witness.

02:49:18.847 --> 02:49:20.544
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: We got to kill all the witnesses.

02:49:20.544 --> 02:49:23.221
MARISHA: We will either slit his throat,
or we will wipe his memory.

02:49:23.221 --> 02:49:25.178
LAURA: Wipe his memory, grab him.
MARISHA: So let me, let me go get him.

02:49:25.178 --> 02:49:26.619
Can I go get him?

02:49:26.619 --> 02:49:29.674
LIAM: I'm pretty sure we could subdue him successfully

02:49:29.674 --> 02:49:30.704
amongst the nine of us.

02:49:30.704 --> 02:49:33.224
MARISHA: I'm not going to hurt him.

02:49:33.224 --> 02:49:34.057
I go.

02:49:35.074 --> 02:49:37.634
LIAM: In such.
MATT: So you're climbing up?

02:49:37.634 --> 02:49:40.518
MARISHA: I'm following behind him.
TALIESIN: This is what happens when we lie.

02:49:40.518 --> 02:49:43.204
MATT: So Beauregard, you climb up to the top

02:49:43.204 --> 02:49:45.294
and there's a bit of a lip before it angles,

02:49:45.294 --> 02:49:47.382
if you recall, and then head straight up again.

02:49:47.382 --> 02:49:50.194
You get into the lip and he's on the opposite

02:49:50.194 --> 02:49:52.796
end of it, and he looks over in your direction.

02:49:52.796 --> 02:49:54.054
(slice) Cuts the rope.

02:49:54.054 --> 02:49:55.429
SAM: Oh!

02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:57.910
MATT: You slide out and then fall.

02:49:59.118 --> 02:50:01.124
MARISHA: Can I grab the ledge?

02:50:01.124 --> 02:50:01.975
I'm a monk.

02:50:01.975 --> 02:50:03.082
I'm awesome.

02:50:03.082 --> 02:50:04.140
MATT: You're a monk.

02:50:04.140 --> 02:50:05.674
It is solid ice.

02:50:05.674 --> 02:50:07.814
Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw

02:50:07.814 --> 02:50:09.654
with disadvantage.
TALIESIN: Wait-- ah.

02:50:09.654 --> 02:50:11.984
MARISHA: Fair.
LAURA: You were so far below.

02:50:11.984 --> 02:50:14.056
MARISHA: That's on this.
TALIESIN: Does she still have Freedom of Movement?

02:50:15.135 --> 02:50:17.214
MARISHA: With disad-- oh my god, that's funny.

02:50:17.214 --> 02:50:18.395
MATT: Lasts an hour?

02:50:18.395 --> 02:50:21.376
TALIESIN: Uh, that's a good--
MATT: I would say no.

02:50:21.376 --> 02:50:23.082
TALIESIN: One hour, nevermind. Okay.

02:50:23.082 --> 02:50:25.033
MATT: With all the trekking.
MARISHA: Dex saving throw?

02:50:25.033 --> 02:50:27.758
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Stopping for Caleb to cast.

02:50:27.758 --> 02:50:31.114
MARISHA: Okay, I, hilariously, rolled two nines.

02:50:31.114 --> 02:50:32.659
So 19.

02:50:32.659 --> 02:50:33.492
MATT: Mm-mm.

02:50:34.391 --> 02:50:37.406
You literally reach up and try and grab, and your hand

02:50:37.406 --> 02:50:39.594
grabs onto just smooth solid ice

02:50:39.594 --> 02:50:41.594
and just slides off.

02:50:41.594 --> 02:50:42.554
MARISHA: Slow Fall.

02:50:42.554 --> 02:50:45.374
MATT: Right. So you do fall and you take--

02:50:46.614 --> 02:50:49.074
MARISHA: I'm more pissed at this guy more than anything.

02:50:49.074 --> 02:50:50.874
MATT: He did not trust you all.

02:50:50.874 --> 02:50:53.534
He got to go first and may have overheard some of you

02:50:53.534 --> 02:50:56.841
talking about slitting his throat or taking care of him

02:50:56.841 --> 02:50:58.614
in a large chamber that echoes well.

02:50:58.614 --> 02:50:59.869
So he cut that fucking rope.

02:50:59.869 --> 02:51:02.211
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.
ASHLEY: Fair enough.

02:51:06.736 --> 02:51:09.364
MATT: 27 points of bludgeoning damage from the fall.

02:51:09.364 --> 02:51:10.254
MARISHA: Negated.

02:51:10.254 --> 02:51:11.174
SAM: Negated?!

02:51:11.174 --> 02:51:12.699
LAURA: As soon as I see--
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:51:12.699 --> 02:51:13.961
LAURA: -- Beau start falling--

02:51:13.961 --> 02:51:15.369
MATT: You guys are watching and all of a sudden

02:51:15.369 --> 02:51:18.154
you see the rope begin to fall

02:51:18.154 --> 02:51:20.304
and Beauregard just plummeting.

02:51:20.304 --> 02:51:22.320
LAURA: Yeah, the minute I see that happen,

02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:23.320
I know she's safe.

02:51:23.320 --> 02:51:26.633
I'm going to use Message.

02:51:26.633 --> 02:51:28.213
And I'm going to send a message to Daygen.

02:51:28.213 --> 02:51:29.046
MATT: Okay.

02:51:29.046 --> 02:51:30.348
SAM: (whispering) Dagen.

02:51:30.348 --> 02:51:31.762
LAURA: Dagen.

02:51:31.762 --> 02:51:32.595
Dagen!

02:51:33.794 --> 02:51:37.804
And I'm going to say: There's a guy coming out. Catch him.

02:51:37.804 --> 02:51:39.364
Don't let him leave.

02:51:39.364 --> 02:51:41.084
It's really important.

02:51:42.034 --> 02:51:43.124
He's dangerous.

02:51:44.114 --> 02:51:45.329
SAM: He's going to fucking kill him.

02:51:45.329 --> 02:51:46.454
TRAVIS: I didn't know she was doing that,

02:51:46.454 --> 02:51:48.954
but as soon as I see Beau falling,

02:51:48.954 --> 02:51:51.424
I summon the sword and you see it glow,

02:51:51.424 --> 02:51:52.694
and I'll cast Fly

02:51:52.694 --> 02:51:54.847
and just take off right up.

02:51:54.847 --> 02:51:57.254
MARISHA: I just slam my fist into the wall,

02:51:57.254 --> 02:51:58.774
and as I'm sliding down, I go:

02:51:58.774 --> 02:52:02.214
Somebody get 'im. As I'm coming down.

02:52:02.214 --> 02:52:03.301
MATT: Had you not used Fly today?

02:52:03.301 --> 02:52:04.684
TRAVIS: Mm-mm.
MATT: Okay, then, yeah.

02:52:04.684 --> 02:52:08.084
TRAVIS: No. Faerie Fire and Fly.
MARISHA: I can negate 65 fall damage,

02:52:08.084 --> 02:52:09.483
just off the top.
SAM: Damn!

02:52:09.483 --> 02:52:10.784
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Whoa.

02:52:10.784 --> 02:52:13.404
LIAM: Crouching Tiger, just flying like Chow Yun-fat.

02:52:13.404 --> 02:52:14.846
MATT: Okay.

02:52:14.846 --> 02:52:16.307
Dagen responds,

02:52:18.105 --> 02:52:21.924
"Okay, let me just make my way over there

02:52:21.924 --> 02:52:23.549
"I'm a little holed up right now."

02:52:23.549 --> 02:52:25.624
SAM: I'm going to start levitating.

02:52:25.624 --> 02:52:26.914
MATT: Okay. You start levitating.

02:52:26.914 --> 02:52:28.630
SAM: I will fly just like Fjord did,

02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:30.930
same pose, but way slower.

02:52:30.930 --> 02:52:32.963
(laughter)

02:52:32.963 --> 02:52:34.940
MATT: Fjord just full-on Neo jumps.

02:52:34.940 --> 02:52:35.913
(whooshes)

02:52:35.913 --> 02:52:37.177
(slower whoosh)

02:52:37.177 --> 02:52:38.310
LAURA: Get him, get him, get him.

02:52:38.310 --> 02:52:39.963
MATT: (laughs)

02:52:39.963 --> 02:52:40.796
Okay.

02:52:40.796 --> 02:52:42.544
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

02:52:42.544 --> 02:52:43.377
MATT: Yeah.

02:52:43.377 --> 02:52:45.494
You used Superman up like (whooshing)

02:52:45.494 --> 02:52:48.554
and he's currently quickly climbing up.

02:52:48.554 --> 02:52:50.404
There is-- do you have darkvision?

02:52:50.404 --> 02:52:53.004
Yeah, if you're half orc, you do. So does he.

02:52:53.004 --> 02:52:55.732
He gets maybe about 40 feet from

02:52:55.732 --> 02:52:57.734
the lip before you catch up to him.

02:52:57.734 --> 02:52:59.130
TRAVIS: I'll just go past.
MATT: He's like, (whimpers).

02:52:59.130 --> 02:53:01.060
TRAVIS: Right up top.

02:53:01.060 --> 02:53:02.444
MATT: And just scurries up as fast as he can.

02:53:02.444 --> 02:53:04.834
TRAVIS: I'll just look over the lip and be like:

02:53:04.834 --> 02:53:06.567
That was very rude.

02:53:07.831 --> 02:53:11.304
MATT: He gets to the top and steps onto it.

02:53:11.304 --> 02:53:13.334
MARISHA: Yep, we're back, baby!

02:53:13.334 --> 02:53:14.532
Yeah, this feels good.
MATT: Clutches his pack

02:53:14.532 --> 02:53:15.854
in one hand and reaches to

02:53:15.854 --> 02:53:17.374
the side where he has a little shortsword

02:53:17.374 --> 02:53:20.016
and he's like, "Listen, I don't want any trouble,

02:53:20.016 --> 02:53:20.955
"I don't, I--"

02:53:20.955 --> 02:53:23.194
TRAVIS: I just put the Star Razor on the ground.

02:53:23.194 --> 02:53:24.260
I'm just spinning it.

02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:25.984
(laughter)

02:53:25.984 --> 02:53:28.609
MATT: "Just let me go. I'm just going to go back to Balen--

02:53:28.609 --> 02:53:31.084
TRAVIS: Let you go, as if we had any ill intentions for you,

02:53:31.084 --> 02:53:33.934
but you cut the rope on my friends.

02:53:33.934 --> 02:53:36.247
That was not the thing to do.

02:53:37.084 --> 02:53:39.062
Sit down.

02:53:39.062 --> 02:53:40.354
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:53:41.434 --> 02:53:43.254
SAM: This is how we treat allies.

02:53:43.254 --> 02:53:44.134
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:53:44.134 --> 02:53:45.844
This feels like the good old days. I love it.

02:53:45.844 --> 02:53:47.399
TRAVIS: 25.

02:53:47.399 --> 02:53:49.114
Plus 10 to intimidation.

02:53:49.114 --> 02:53:50.421
SAM: He jumps to his death.

02:53:50.421 --> 02:53:52.173
(laughter)

02:53:52.173 --> 02:53:55.621
MARISHA: We catch him. No, dude, no. Stop.

02:53:55.621 --> 02:53:58.531
MATT: "I was just hired to do this.

02:53:58.531 --> 02:54:00.214
"I have no stake in this.

02:54:00.214 --> 02:54:03.094
"I am not trying to hurt anybody,

02:54:03.094 --> 02:54:04.817
"but I'm not about to get killed by--"

02:54:04.817 --> 02:54:05.954
TRAVIS: No one's going to kill you.

02:54:05.954 --> 02:54:07.704
Look, you seem to have the wrong idea.

02:54:07.704 --> 02:54:08.914
We meant what we said.

02:54:08.914 --> 02:54:10.934
Your friends were already dead.

02:54:10.934 --> 02:54:13.074
We clearly had lots of trouble down there,

02:54:13.074 --> 02:54:15.961
but I'm not going to let you leave my friends to their death

02:54:15.961 --> 02:54:17.341
and let you just run away.

02:54:17.341 --> 02:54:20.084
MATT: There's this crunching sound behind him.

02:54:20.084 --> 02:54:21.974
And he turns and looks and you see there,

02:54:21.974 --> 02:54:23.454
just over the edge of the snow,

02:54:23.454 --> 02:54:25.746
hood up, Dagen.
LIAM: Dope.

02:54:25.746 --> 02:54:28.145
MATT: In his combat chair,

02:54:28.145 --> 02:54:30.328
the ax out in front, just goes,

02:54:30.328 --> 02:54:32.326
"You should probably listen to the man, huh?"

02:54:32.326 --> 02:54:34.925
ALL: Yeah!
(laughter)

02:54:34.925 --> 02:54:38.104
MATT: You see snow frost in his beard.

02:54:38.104 --> 02:54:39.004
He looks pretty good.

02:54:39.004 --> 02:54:40.924
You can see he's pretty good

02:54:40.924 --> 02:54:42.294
at camouflaging himself out here.

02:54:42.294 --> 02:54:44.304
He has a separate white cloak that he puts on

02:54:44.304 --> 02:54:45.364
and the frost that gathers around it,

02:54:45.364 --> 02:54:48.234
you can barely see him except for when he adjusted himself.

02:54:48.234 --> 02:54:49.067
TRAVIS: Believe me,

02:54:49.067 --> 02:54:51.284
I really don't want to arrange a meeting between

02:54:51.284 --> 02:54:53.360
you and Sheila, but I will.

02:54:58.214 --> 02:54:59.264
Just sit.

02:54:59.264 --> 02:55:00.097
<i>Sit</i>.

02:55:01.244 --> 02:55:03.913
MATT: He sits in the yellow snow
that has gathered around him.

02:55:03.913 --> 02:55:04.987
MARISHA: Aww.
ASHLEY: Oh.

02:55:04.987 --> 02:55:06.404
LAURA: Buddy.
MATT: (laughs)

02:55:06.404 --> 02:55:10.120
SAM: I crest the top and land and say:

02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:11.980
That was a mistake.

02:55:11.980 --> 02:55:13.721
(laughter)

02:55:13.721 --> 02:55:16.948
SAM: You cut the rope on my friends.

02:55:16.948 --> 02:55:19.044
And I am not going to let that--

02:55:19.044 --> 02:55:20.890
Seems like I'm--

02:55:20.890 --> 02:55:23.489
TRAVIS: Veth, we-- that was inspired.

02:55:23.489 --> 02:55:24.370
Already--

02:55:24.370 --> 02:55:25.859
It was pitch perfect.
SAM: We take care of it already?

02:55:25.859 --> 02:55:27.613
TRAVIS: Yep.
SAM: (sighs) Okay.

02:55:27.613 --> 02:55:29.084
(laughter)

02:55:29.084 --> 02:55:30.854
TRAVIS: Now in all of that package you have,

02:55:30.854 --> 02:55:32.284
I don't suppose you have any,

02:55:32.284 --> 02:55:34.834
I don't know, additional rope, do you?

02:55:37.944 --> 02:55:38.777
MATT: (as Iver) "No."

02:55:39.754 --> 02:55:40.587
TRAVIS: No.

02:55:41.559 --> 02:55:42.392
Right.

02:55:42.392 --> 02:55:45.594
Did we grab the rope as we were fleeing the smoking chimney

02:55:45.594 --> 02:55:47.164
that we created?

02:55:47.164 --> 02:55:48.193
LAURA: Sure.

02:55:48.193 --> 02:55:49.512
LIAM: I think we would have.
TALIESIN: We pulled it.

02:55:49.512 --> 02:55:51.178
MATT: Yeah. You were pulling to help with the rope, yeah.

02:55:51.178 --> 02:55:52.803
LIAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

02:55:52.803 --> 02:55:54.089
Who has that?

02:55:55.425 --> 02:55:56.549
ASHLEY: I do!
SAM: Not either of us.

02:55:56.549 --> 02:55:57.691
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:55:57.691 --> 02:55:59.654
My friends are going to watch you

02:55:59.654 --> 02:56:03.084
so that we can all make our way out of here safely.

02:56:03.084 --> 02:56:03.917
I'll be back.

02:56:03.917 --> 02:56:08.281
I just jump off the edge and float back down using Fly.

02:56:08.281 --> 02:56:09.114
I'll grab the rope,

02:56:09.114 --> 02:56:11.814
fly back up, and our friends will start

02:56:11.814 --> 02:56:13.253
to make our way back up.

02:56:13.253 --> 02:56:14.941
LAURA: ♪ Making my way back up ♪

02:56:14.941 --> 02:56:16.941
TALIESIN: ♪ Making my way back up ♪

02:56:19.584 --> 02:56:21.714
MATT: Slowly, you all get back to the top,

02:56:21.714 --> 02:56:23.314
and it is pitch black out here

02:56:23.314 --> 02:56:25.634
and it is freezing cold.

02:56:25.634 --> 02:56:27.074
The wind is starting to pick up.

02:56:27.074 --> 02:56:29.865
And while there isn't any snowfall at the moment,

02:56:31.698 --> 02:56:34.723
Dagen, as he starts to notice you all approaching, goes,

02:56:37.085 --> 02:56:38.774
"I think there's a storm coming.

02:56:38.774 --> 02:56:42.704
"Probably some heavy sleet.

02:56:42.704 --> 02:56:46.844
"Let's try and find ourselves someplace to shelter up."

02:56:46.844 --> 02:56:49.397
TALIESIN: We're not going to have--
LIAM: Caleb's still halfway down the rope.

02:56:49.397 --> 02:56:51.517
(wheezing) Oh gods.
TALIESIN: We're not going to have the good--

02:56:51.517 --> 02:56:53.368
LAURA: I help him, I'm pulling the rope.
LIAM: Oh gods.

02:56:53.368 --> 02:56:55.373
MATT: "We're not doing the tower thing?"

02:56:55.373 --> 02:56:56.844
SAM: We can't.

02:56:56.844 --> 02:56:58.974
LAURA: We used a lot of energy.

02:56:58.974 --> 02:57:00.264
SAM: We're at a magical deficit,

02:57:00.264 --> 02:57:02.480
but we could make some--

02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:04.346
well, I think the dome keeps us warm, right?

02:57:04.346 --> 02:57:05.488
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll be okay.

02:57:05.488 --> 02:57:07.722
We have alternate accommodations.

02:57:07.722 --> 02:57:09.868
We should get away from the mouth of this thing, though.

02:57:09.868 --> 02:57:10.701
TALIESIN: We should move as far away from this--

02:57:10.701 --> 02:57:11.796
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: It's really high.

02:57:11.796 --> 02:57:14.613
LAURA: Where were you holed up before, Dagen?

02:57:14.613 --> 02:57:16.557
MATT: Points over and you can see a little ways away,

02:57:16.557 --> 02:57:18.704
there's a small bit of a snowbank that

02:57:18.704 --> 02:57:20.584
he had carved out,

02:57:20.584 --> 02:57:23.244
and it looks like it may have been utilized

02:57:23.244 --> 02:57:24.094
to form a snowbank

02:57:24.094 --> 02:57:26.724
where he can keep his eyes peeled and glance over towards

02:57:26.724 --> 02:57:28.424
the entrance where you guys were.

02:57:28.424 --> 02:57:29.304
LAURA: Was it--

02:57:29.304 --> 02:57:31.084
Maybe we should be a little farther away.

02:57:31.084 --> 02:57:32.688
Let's keep going.
TRAVIS: Unless we can change the appearance

02:57:32.688 --> 02:57:34.621
to be white, like snow.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:57:34.621 --> 02:57:36.894
MARISHA: Even if we can get an hour away from here.

02:57:36.894 --> 02:57:38.135
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: As far as we can go.

02:57:38.135 --> 02:57:41.424
TRAVIS: Iver, aren't you glad you
decided to stick with friends?

02:57:41.424 --> 02:57:43.047
Look at these conditions.

02:57:44.844 --> 02:57:46.494
MATT: "But where are you all going?"

02:57:46.494 --> 02:57:47.881
TRAVIS: Somewhere safe.

02:57:47.881 --> 02:57:48.714
MATT: "Balenpost?"

02:57:50.524 --> 02:57:51.757
LAURA: Eventually.

02:57:52.664 --> 02:57:54.659
MATT: "Can I just make my way towards Balenpost?"

02:57:54.659 --> 02:57:57.275
TRAVIS: I don't think so.
LAURA: You can, totally. Yes.

02:57:57.275 --> 02:57:59.604
You know what? Let's just hole up together tonight.

02:57:59.604 --> 02:58:02.114
We want you to be safe and then you can go wherever

02:58:02.114 --> 02:58:02.947
you need to go.

02:58:02.947 --> 02:58:03.780
TRAVIS: That's what I meant.

02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:04.757
TALIESIN: This on me.

02:58:04.757 --> 02:58:07.647
I'm just a bad liar, I'm so sorry.

02:58:09.472 --> 02:58:11.354
I'm not good at it.

02:58:11.354 --> 02:58:13.234
MATT: "You're a very strange group of people."

02:58:13.234 --> 02:58:14.651
TALIESIN: I know.

02:58:16.654 --> 02:58:18.374
LAURA: Let's get an hour away.

02:58:18.374 --> 02:58:19.684
Let's get an hour away.

02:58:19.684 --> 02:58:22.204
SAM: Just throwing this out there.

02:58:22.204 --> 02:58:25.304
What's to say that they aren't watching us

02:58:25.304 --> 02:58:29.164
right now and will know where we camp for the night?

02:58:29.164 --> 02:58:30.254
Just throwing it out there.

02:58:30.254 --> 02:58:33.314
LAURA: Because when you're scrying on somebody,

02:58:33.314 --> 02:58:35.484
when you're you're looking at them,

02:58:35.484 --> 02:58:38.054
you don't see everything around them.

02:58:38.054 --> 02:58:40.534
You just see them.

02:58:40.534 --> 02:58:44.494
So if we're in the middle of nothing in the middle of snow,

02:58:44.494 --> 02:58:45.327
we won't--

02:58:45.327 --> 02:58:47.604
SAM: So we should find a place with no

02:58:47.604 --> 02:58:49.324
immediate landmarks.

02:58:49.324 --> 02:58:50.608
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

02:58:51.883 --> 02:58:53.924
LIAM: But still post watch.

02:58:53.924 --> 02:58:54.757
LAURA: Sure, of course.

02:58:54.757 --> 02:58:56.404
TRAVIS: Much agreed. Yeah.

02:58:56.404 --> 02:58:59.690
Anything that comes on the horizon or close, yes.

02:58:59.690 --> 02:59:02.648
MATT: Okay. Dagen gathers his things.

02:59:02.648 --> 02:59:05.054
All right. Well, point in a direction, and

02:59:05.054 --> 02:59:07.914
I guess I'll take you the fastest route I can muster.

02:59:07.914 --> 02:59:10.514
LIAM: Well, <i>ja</i>, Dagen, find us the most nondescript spot

02:59:10.514 --> 02:59:12.344
you can out here.

02:59:12.344 --> 02:59:13.460
MATT: "Nondescript.

02:59:13.460 --> 02:59:14.914
"Plenty of that going around, don't worry."

02:59:14.914 --> 02:59:17.664
And he pulls his lever on the side and you watch as the

02:59:17.664 --> 02:59:21.388
heavy metallic sled front clicks up into place.

02:59:21.388 --> 02:59:25.694
Pulls his hood up, thicker to keep heat in,

02:59:25.694 --> 02:59:27.702
brushes some of the ice from his beard.

02:59:28.734 --> 02:59:29.634
"All right, get ready."

02:59:29.634 --> 02:59:31.184
Throws his scarf around the front of his mouth

02:59:31.184 --> 02:59:32.984
to keep that bundled up and warm,

02:59:32.984 --> 02:59:35.739
and he begins to push forward as

02:59:35.739 --> 02:59:38.331
the little pointed hook parts in

02:59:38.331 --> 02:59:40.624
the outside of the wheel

02:59:40.624 --> 02:59:43.094
begin to pull him forward through the heavy snow and ice,

02:59:43.094 --> 02:59:44.614
and as you all follow behind.

02:59:44.614 --> 02:59:48.276
Who is watching your new friend Iver?

02:59:48.276 --> 02:59:50.410
Okay. Okay.

02:59:51.447 --> 02:59:53.994
You guys trudge on for the next hour or so,

02:59:53.994 --> 02:59:57.404
following the path of your guide.

02:59:57.404 --> 02:59:59.584
LAURA: I'm assuming we've tied his hands too and his--

02:59:59.584 --> 03:00:00.634
TRAVIS: No, no, no, he's free.

03:00:00.634 --> 03:00:02.704
And I'm going to pull out one of the cloaks

03:00:02.704 --> 03:00:05.797
from the Bag of Holding and just offer it in case he's cold.

03:00:06.674 --> 03:00:08.774
MATT: He takes it and bundles up even further.

03:00:11.034 --> 03:00:13.764
"So what are you doing out here, then?

03:00:13.764 --> 03:00:15.214
"You're just treasure hunters?"

03:00:16.265 --> 03:00:18.084
TALIESIN: Oh, it's complicated.

03:00:18.084 --> 03:00:20.204
TRAVIS: We're on a bit of a secretive state business.

03:00:20.204 --> 03:00:22.317
We'd love to share, but I think it's safer for you--

03:00:22.317 --> 03:00:23.874
LAURA: It's of dire importance.

03:00:23.874 --> 03:00:26.703
We're saving the world!

03:00:28.170 --> 03:00:29.474
MATT: "Fine, keep your secrets.

03:00:29.474 --> 03:00:30.307
"It's fine."

03:00:31.284 --> 03:00:34.084
And just keeps walking alongside you quietly after that.

03:00:36.254 --> 03:00:37.814
As you guys continue on, there's a certain point,

03:00:37.814 --> 03:00:40.114
Jester, you hear a familiar voice in your ear say,

03:00:41.944 --> 03:00:44.370
(as Artagan) "Can I just trip him, just once?"

03:00:46.018 --> 03:00:47.515
LAURA: Well, yeah, obviously.

03:00:47.515 --> 03:00:50.094
MATT: You here "Ah!" (grunts)

03:00:50.094 --> 03:00:51.694
Glance over and it's this face

03:00:51.694 --> 03:00:55.239
full of-- like a pie to the face of snow.

03:00:55.239 --> 03:00:58.347
TRAVIS: You all right? Let us help you up.
LAURA: Oh, are you okay?

03:00:58.347 --> 03:00:59.655
MATT: "I saw--"

03:00:59.655 --> 03:01:01.084
TRAVIS: What happened?

03:01:01.084 --> 03:01:02.817
In the middle of snow, what did you trip on?

03:01:03.931 --> 03:01:04.764
MATT: He looks back.

03:01:04.764 --> 03:01:06.974
"I don't, I thought I saw--"

03:01:08.955 --> 03:01:10.177
He keeps walking.

03:01:11.484 --> 03:01:13.093
Voice creeps back into your ear and goes,

03:01:13.093 --> 03:01:14.684
"Thank you.

03:01:14.684 --> 03:01:15.884
"I needed that."

03:01:15.884 --> 03:01:16.900
LAURA: I did, too.

03:01:18.464 --> 03:01:19.772
TRAVIS: Got to get a fix.

03:01:19.772 --> 03:01:21.424
MATT: At the end of the hour, the temperature

03:01:21.424 --> 03:01:23.871
continues to plummet.

03:01:23.871 --> 03:01:25.164
And you all

03:01:26.404 --> 03:01:29.799
find comfort in Dagen pulling you over towards

03:01:29.799 --> 03:01:31.294
this stone archway.

03:01:31.294 --> 03:01:33.184
It's like there are elements of rock

03:01:33.184 --> 03:01:34.934
that have built up to create

03:01:34.934 --> 03:01:38.894
this natural arch about, maybe 10 feet off the ground,

03:01:38.894 --> 03:01:41.569
15, 20 across, and he goes,

03:01:41.569 --> 03:01:45.514
"I mean, this is so it's not terribly nondescript.

03:01:45.514 --> 03:01:47.034
"You know, either we're camping out

03:01:47.034 --> 03:01:48.514
"in the middle of an open snow field,

03:01:48.514 --> 03:01:50.824
"or we're hoping to use some of the environment,

03:01:50.824 --> 03:01:52.844
"to give us a little bit of shelter.

03:01:52.844 --> 03:01:56.017
"Since we're not using your fancy wizard tower,

03:01:57.004 --> 03:01:58.352
"this is our best bet to make something

03:01:58.352 --> 03:01:59.702
"that could house all of us."

03:02:01.394 --> 03:02:02.924
SAM: Well, we won't need that, right?

03:02:02.924 --> 03:02:04.444
LIAM: I can help us out a little bit

03:02:04.444 --> 03:02:06.060
I have a bit of a halfway measure.

03:02:06.060 --> 03:02:07.791
TALIESIN: It's going to be tight.

03:02:07.791 --> 03:02:09.311
LAURA: Yeah. We'll be cozy.

03:02:11.310 --> 03:02:13.864
SAM: I don't think we need to use this.

03:02:13.864 --> 03:02:15.114
TALIESIN: We should do both.

03:02:15.114 --> 03:02:16.084
SAM: Both? Okay.

03:02:16.084 --> 03:02:17.672
LIAM: I think so.

03:02:17.672 --> 03:02:18.505
LAURA: Okay.

03:02:18.505 --> 03:02:19.755
LIAM: There've got to be a lot of ridges

03:02:19.755 --> 03:02:21.696
and mountainsides here.

03:02:23.794 --> 03:02:24.627
MATT: Okay.

03:02:24.627 --> 03:02:25.854
SAM: All right. We'll make camp.

03:02:25.854 --> 03:02:26.687
MATT: "All right.

03:02:26.687 --> 03:02:28.674
"Follow me, Wizard Boy."

03:02:28.674 --> 03:02:30.644
He goes and takes you around the side

03:02:30.644 --> 03:02:32.464
and finds on the opposite side of this,

03:02:32.464 --> 03:02:33.704
it's leaning over to the edge

03:02:33.704 --> 03:02:35.074
and there's a bit of a lip at the top,

03:02:35.074 --> 03:02:38.904
which does offer a little bit of protection.

03:02:38.904 --> 03:02:41.596
Which is good. It does cut the wind off from this area, too.

03:02:41.596 --> 03:02:45.011
The wind has been heavily blowing from east to west

03:02:45.011 --> 03:02:45.844
and in your face.

03:02:45.844 --> 03:02:47.104
And once you get to this side

03:02:47.104 --> 03:02:49.264
it's a little bit to the left of where you arrived

03:02:49.264 --> 03:02:51.124
and you're able to block off most of the heavy wind

03:02:51.124 --> 03:02:53.204
from hitting you, setting up where Dagen

03:02:53.204 --> 03:02:54.377
has you guys situated.

03:02:55.367 --> 03:02:58.017
LIAM: Okay, so I'll take 10 minutes to throw up the dome.

03:03:02.814 --> 03:03:04.747
Here, Iver, have a seat.

03:03:06.094 --> 03:03:06.927
MATT: He sits down.

03:03:06.927 --> 03:03:08.454
LIAM: No one is more surprised than me,

03:03:08.454 --> 03:03:10.384
but I'm going to be the good cop tonight here.

03:03:10.384 --> 03:03:11.567
Take this glass jar,

03:03:12.774 --> 03:03:14.354
eat one of those little balls in there

03:03:14.354 --> 03:03:16.234
that will fill you up for the night.

03:03:16.234 --> 03:03:17.659
Have a cat.

03:03:17.659 --> 03:03:19.114
Frumpkin appears in his lap

03:03:19.114 --> 03:03:21.554
and just starts turning circles,

03:03:21.554 --> 03:03:24.444
nestles down into his criss-cross applesauce lap,

03:03:24.444 --> 03:03:27.174
and just starts to purr as loud as possible.

03:03:27.174 --> 03:03:28.916
Have a cat. It will make you feel better.

03:03:29.882 --> 03:03:34.882
LAURA: I'm going to cast Charm Person on him as well.

03:03:35.124 --> 03:03:35.957
MATT: Okay.

03:03:40.194 --> 03:03:41.444
Yeah, he does not resist.

03:03:43.123 --> 03:03:46.664
LAURA: I'm just going to try to charm the pants off him

03:03:46.664 --> 03:03:48.654
and make him feel like he's the safest

03:03:48.654 --> 03:03:50.204
that he's ever been in his whole life.

03:03:50.204 --> 03:03:52.344
You know, don't worry. Everything's okay.

03:03:52.344 --> 03:03:54.154
You know, you're probably pretty exhausted

03:03:54.154 --> 03:03:56.924
after everything. You should just go to sleep.

03:03:56.924 --> 03:03:59.524
We'll talk about everything in the morning.

03:03:59.524 --> 03:04:01.204
MATT: "No, you're right.

03:04:01.204 --> 03:04:03.404
"I apologize for getting off the wrong foot.

03:04:03.404 --> 03:04:05.970
"I just, you know.

03:04:06.928 --> 03:04:08.828
"Have you been up this far north before?"

03:04:09.944 --> 03:04:10.777
LAURA: Never.

03:04:10.777 --> 03:04:12.177
MATT: "There's a lot of,

03:04:13.385 --> 03:04:16.510
"well, throat cutting,

03:04:17.624 --> 03:04:22.624
"a lot of competition for relics

03:04:22.914 --> 03:04:25.664
"and being the first to delve the deepest

03:04:25.664 --> 03:04:28.784
"as people continue to explore further into these places."

03:04:28.784 --> 03:04:30.494
LAURA: And some people are crazy.

03:04:30.494 --> 03:04:31.974
MATT: "I just, you know,

03:04:31.974 --> 03:04:34.384
"I was not one to trust when you arrived,

03:04:34.384 --> 03:04:36.724
"but when you returned, there was, I don't know,

03:04:36.724 --> 03:04:41.297
"such an air of deceit about you

03:04:41.297 --> 03:04:42.614
"that I assume the worst.

03:04:42.614 --> 03:04:44.404
"So that is on me.

03:04:44.404 --> 03:04:45.564
"I apologize."

03:04:45.564 --> 03:04:48.204
LIAM: We have learned to take up
a harsh exterior to better deal

03:04:48.204 --> 03:04:50.771
with unsavory types ourselves.

03:04:50.771 --> 03:04:52.730
MATT: "And this, I understand."

03:04:53.963 --> 03:04:56.823
(laughter)

03:04:56.823 --> 03:04:58.554
MARISHA: And Caduceus never lied again.

03:04:58.554 --> 03:05:03.554
MATT: "How does a cat live so comfortably

03:05:03.554 --> 03:05:05.077
"in such a cold environment?"

03:05:06.084 --> 03:05:08.784
LIAM: Well, he is not just an ordinary cat.

03:05:08.784 --> 03:05:13.784
He is special. King of cats.

03:05:14.314 --> 03:05:16.144
LAURA: He's a cat prince, if you will.

03:05:16.144 --> 03:05:17.864
MATT: "Is he a king or a prince?"

03:05:17.864 --> 03:05:19.903
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: "Yeah?

03:05:19.903 --> 03:05:20.784
"That's confusing."

03:05:20.784 --> 03:05:21.764
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:05:21.764 --> 03:05:23.490
MATT: "Well, thank you, Cat King Prince."

03:05:23.490 --> 03:05:25.669
(laughter)

03:05:25.669 --> 03:05:27.374
LIAM: Frumpkin just rolls over

03:05:27.374 --> 03:05:30.204
with his belly exposed, and the arms

03:05:30.204 --> 03:05:31.552
go out like that.

03:05:31.552 --> 03:05:34.630
MATT: "Oh ho ho ho!" And he scratches on his stomach.

03:05:34.630 --> 03:05:36.314
ASHLEY: Do you spend a lot of time out here?

03:05:36.314 --> 03:05:38.071
LIAM: Dome's already built.
LAURA: Oh, dome's already built.

03:05:38.071 --> 03:05:40.344
We're warming up. Everything's great.

03:05:40.344 --> 03:05:42.021
ASHLEY: Yeah. Oh, yeah?

03:05:42.021 --> 03:05:47.021
MATT: "This far out, not too much. Usually, just to these

03:05:47.021 --> 03:05:49.188
"particular sites."

03:05:49.188 --> 03:05:50.321
He looks over towards Dagen

03:05:50.321 --> 03:05:53.084
and Dagen says, "I'm familiar.

03:05:53.084 --> 03:05:56.684
"We both do a similar work.

03:05:56.684 --> 03:05:59.104
"Though you've only been here a few months.

03:05:59.104 --> 03:06:01.474
"Isn't that right, little one?"

03:06:01.474 --> 03:06:04.494
(as Iver) "Well, yes, but we all need income.

03:06:04.494 --> 03:06:05.327
"Right?

03:06:07.109 --> 03:06:09.104
"I'm not as good as he is."

03:06:10.110 --> 03:06:11.235
ASHLEY: It's okay.

03:06:11.235 --> 03:06:12.517
You're learning.

03:06:12.517 --> 03:06:13.650
MATT: And Dagen goes, "Well, yeah,

03:06:13.650 --> 03:06:18.625
"I kept my employers alive for one thing."

03:06:20.801 --> 03:06:23.294
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh.

03:06:23.294 --> 03:06:25.240
MATT: Just gets quiet at that point.

03:06:25.240 --> 03:06:27.323
(laughter)

03:06:29.094 --> 03:06:31.964
But, eventually, if you guys need
to bed down for the evening.

03:06:31.964 --> 03:06:35.307
TRAVIS: It'll be a long night; I'll take the first watch.

03:06:35.307 --> 03:06:36.334
Yep?

03:06:36.334 --> 03:06:37.604
MATT: You put the dome up?

03:06:37.604 --> 03:06:38.827
LIAM: Yeah. I'm sorry.

03:06:38.827 --> 03:06:39.894
I thought I made that clear. Yeah.

03:06:39.894 --> 03:06:42.994
MATT: Well, the dome lasts for eight hours,

03:06:42.994 --> 03:06:44.514
and you need an eight-hour rest period.

03:06:44.514 --> 03:06:45.794
So the domes should be put up right

03:06:45.794 --> 03:06:46.724
when you're ready to sleep.

03:06:46.724 --> 03:06:47.868
LAURA: Yeah.

03:06:47.868 --> 03:06:50.910
LIAM: Well, we're not going to do
a lot of talking here right now.

03:06:50.910 --> 03:06:52.535
LAURA: No.
LIAM: So...

03:06:52.535 --> 03:06:57.535
I've been petting Iver's back

03:06:57.594 --> 03:07:00.194
to help him go to sleep as fast as possible.

03:07:00.194 --> 03:07:03.523
MATT: He's like, "What are you-- oh, okay."

03:07:03.523 --> 03:07:05.664
TRAVIS: He's not Ronin.
LAURA: Go to sleep, go to sleep.

03:07:05.664 --> 03:07:07.264
I'm charming him, too. Don't worry.

03:07:07.264 --> 03:07:10.561
♪ Go to sleep, little Iver. ♪
MATT: It's so weird.

03:07:10.561 --> 03:07:11.682
LAURA: ♪ Go to sleep-- ♪
TRAVIS: He's just crying.

03:07:11.682 --> 03:07:14.761
LAURA: ♪ --while we're sleeping ♪
TRAVIS: He's like, "She's going to kill me."

03:07:14.761 --> 03:07:16.573
MATT: If he wasn't charmed, he probably would be.

03:07:16.573 --> 03:07:18.352
(laughter)

03:07:18.352 --> 03:07:20.562
MATT: He's just waiting for the (shushing).

03:07:20.562 --> 03:07:23.065
LIAM: Frumpkin is right here just going (cat purring).

03:07:23.065 --> 03:07:25.590
LAURA: Yeah. I just want him to sleep through the night.

03:07:26.834 --> 03:07:27.814
MATT: Okay.

03:07:27.814 --> 03:07:28.647
Yeah. He conks out.

03:07:28.647 --> 03:07:31.682
He's exhausted, physically and emotionally.

03:07:33.294 --> 03:07:35.964
But the rest of you find your space in here.

03:07:35.964 --> 03:07:40.155
And when the dome itself appears
and-- what was the coloration

03:07:40.155 --> 03:07:41.412
you're going for now?
LIAM: Oh, white.

03:07:41.412 --> 03:07:42.787
MATT: White, okay.

03:07:44.437 --> 03:07:46.124
As you're all settling up,

03:07:46.124 --> 03:07:48.154
Dagen leans over to you and goes,

03:07:48.154 --> 03:07:52.694
"I don't mean to question your capabilities,

03:07:52.694 --> 03:07:55.869
"but this doesn't look like it's hiding much."

03:07:57.361 --> 03:07:58.714
LIAM: You don't think it's going to hide us?

03:07:58.714 --> 03:08:03.714
Well, from the outside it looks like the snow about us.

03:08:03.954 --> 03:08:06.173
MATT: "Oh, oh, oh.

03:08:06.173 --> 03:08:07.939
"I take that back."
LIAM: And here it's

03:08:07.939 --> 03:08:09.644
see-through from the inside.

03:08:09.644 --> 03:08:10.477
MATT: "Gotcha."

03:08:10.477 --> 03:08:11.826
LIAM: Yeah.

03:08:11.826 --> 03:08:14.044
MATT: "Oh, you wizard types are weird."

03:08:14.044 --> 03:08:15.874
LIAM: I'll get us back into the tower tomorrow night.

03:08:15.874 --> 03:08:18.504
MATT: "Please. It's a nice place.

03:08:18.504 --> 03:08:20.144
"I like what you've put together there."

03:08:20.144 --> 03:08:23.334
LIAM: Do you have any requests or adjustments to your room

03:08:23.334 --> 03:08:26.324
or within reason to the rest of the tower?

03:08:26.324 --> 03:08:27.424
Within reason.

03:08:30.754 --> 03:08:32.124
MATT: "Let me think on that."

03:08:32.124 --> 03:08:33.482
LIAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:08:33.482 --> 03:08:36.968
MATT: "I got some ideas (laughs)."

03:08:36.968 --> 03:08:38.059
MARISHA: That's so good.

03:08:39.154 --> 03:08:41.994
MATT: But if you guys want to prepare yourselves--

03:08:41.994 --> 03:08:45.227
SAM: Just before we sleep, I'm going to mosey over to Beau.

03:08:47.522 --> 03:08:48.361
(whispered) Hey! Beau.

03:08:48.361 --> 03:08:49.784
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:08:49.784 --> 03:08:51.767
SAM: Listen, I've noticed that you

03:08:53.174 --> 03:08:56.594
have been spending some time talking to Yasha a bit more?

03:08:56.594 --> 03:08:59.024
MARISHA: Yeah, what's it to you?

03:08:59.024 --> 03:09:01.834
SAM: Well, wonder if you could help me.

03:09:01.834 --> 03:09:05.644
She and I are going to have sort of a hangout tomorrow night

03:09:05.644 --> 03:09:08.554
and I wondered if you could tell me

03:09:08.554 --> 03:09:11.822
what she likes to do or what I should do for her.

03:09:11.822 --> 03:09:14.934
It's just sort of a one-on-one thing that we're going to do.

03:09:14.934 --> 03:09:17.794
And I thought it'd be nice to do something nice for her.

03:09:17.794 --> 03:09:19.114
You know?
MARISHA: She agreed to this?

03:09:19.114 --> 03:09:20.484
SAM: Yeah. She's all down for it.

03:09:20.484 --> 03:09:24.174
MARISHA: Or did you, like, invite yourself and force it upon

03:09:24.174 --> 03:09:25.462
her without any other--?
SAM: I'm trying to remember.

03:09:25.462 --> 03:09:28.129
No, I think she invited me, actually.

03:09:28.129 --> 03:09:30.278
MARISHA: (suspicious humming)

03:09:30.278 --> 03:09:32.396
SAM: But we're definitely getting together tomorrow

03:09:32.396 --> 03:09:34.879
and I just wanted to do something really nice for her.

03:09:34.879 --> 03:09:36.954
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
(laughter)

03:09:36.954 --> 03:09:39.174
SAM: What do you think I should do? Like a food thing

03:09:39.174 --> 03:09:41.864
or a drink thing or a flower thing?

03:09:41.864 --> 03:09:44.504
MARISHA: What-- why don't you start?

03:09:44.504 --> 03:09:46.404
Why don't you tell me what you have in mind?

03:09:46.404 --> 03:09:49.111
And then maybe I can critique from there.

03:09:49.111 --> 03:09:51.784
SAM: I don't really know her as well as you, but I just,

03:09:51.784 --> 03:09:55.067
you know, she's been through a lot.

03:09:55.067 --> 03:09:57.154
MARISHA: Yeah, hang on let me sit up a little bit

03:09:57.154 --> 03:10:00.178
because it feels like it's going to be a conversation.

03:10:01.671 --> 03:10:02.980
Yeah.

03:10:02.980 --> 03:10:06.381
SAM: I just-- I just want her to--
I sometimes I feel like she

03:10:06.381 --> 03:10:08.434
doesn't feel like she's part of the family, you know,

03:10:08.434 --> 03:10:09.644
and--
MARISHA: Sure, sure.

03:10:09.644 --> 03:10:10.984
Yeah.
SAM: I'm thinking really sweet.

03:10:10.984 --> 03:10:12.874
MARISHA: I mean, you could almost say the same

03:10:12.874 --> 03:10:14.674
thing about Caduceus though too, you know,

03:10:14.674 --> 03:10:15.864
I've been trying to like,

03:10:15.864 --> 03:10:18.341
make sure he feels included.

03:10:18.341 --> 03:10:19.564
SAM: That's a great idea.

03:10:19.564 --> 03:10:21.874
Why don't you do something with him tomorrow night?

03:10:21.874 --> 03:10:24.564
Make him feel welcome.

03:10:26.667 --> 03:10:27.934
It's a great idea.

03:10:27.934 --> 03:10:29.169
MARISHA: You know.

03:10:29.169 --> 03:10:33.858
(laughter)

03:10:33.858 --> 03:10:36.324
MARISHA: Maybe we could circle back around

03:10:36.324 --> 03:10:41.274
and have a family night at a later time.

03:10:42.361 --> 03:10:43.647
SAM: That's a good idea.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:10:43.647 --> 03:10:46.159
SAM: So tomorrow just me and Yasha and then later we'll do

03:10:46.159 --> 03:10:48.309
a big family--
MARISHA: No, no.

03:10:49.711 --> 03:10:51.858
No.
SAM: Good night, Beau.

03:10:51.858 --> 03:10:56.850
(laughter)

03:10:56.850 --> 03:10:58.290
MARISHA: Good night, Veth.

03:10:58.290 --> 03:11:03.290
(laughter)

03:11:03.984 --> 03:11:06.260
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:11:06.260 --> 03:11:07.443
"Well, good night, then."

03:11:07.443 --> 03:11:09.451
(laughter)

03:11:09.451 --> 03:11:10.798
ASHLEY: "No."

03:11:10.798 --> 03:11:12.040
MATT: "No."

03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:14.965
"Good night."
(laughter)

03:11:16.004 --> 03:11:17.614
Perfect.

03:11:17.614 --> 03:11:19.041
All right, who's taking first watch?

03:11:19.041 --> 03:11:20.334
TRAVIS: I am. Fjord.

03:11:20.334 --> 03:11:21.474
MATT: All right.

03:11:21.474 --> 03:11:22.784
LAURA: I'll stay up, too.

03:11:22.784 --> 03:11:24.074
MATT: Okay, so you're both taking first watch?

03:11:24.074 --> 03:11:25.344
Who's taking second watch?

03:11:25.344 --> 03:11:26.634
LIAM: I'll stay up for second.

03:11:26.634 --> 03:11:27.467
MATT: All right.

03:11:27.891 --> 03:11:28.971
MATT: And who's taking third watch?

03:11:28.971 --> 03:11:29.951
TALIESIN: I'll take third.

03:11:29.951 --> 03:11:30.784
MATT: You got it.

03:11:31.691 --> 03:11:34.331
Okay, so first watch,

03:11:34.331 --> 03:11:37.226
everyone else is all bundled up in the dome,

03:11:37.226 --> 03:11:39.211
and it is a very tight camping situation,

03:11:39.211 --> 03:11:42.151
especially with two additional allies in this space.

03:11:42.151 --> 03:11:45.281
It's pretty clustered and tetrised,

03:11:45.281 --> 03:11:46.591
but you all managed to get yourself in there.

03:11:46.591 --> 03:11:48.321
Occasionally, someone will shift,

03:11:48.321 --> 03:11:49.951
and a hand will go out of the dome

03:11:49.951 --> 03:11:50.931
into the freezing cold and be like,

03:11:50.931 --> 03:11:52.798
"Oh, that's a bad idea, bad idea,"

03:11:52.798 --> 03:11:54.461
(chuckling)

03:11:54.461 --> 03:11:56.341
MATT: But it's comfortable enough.

03:11:56.341 --> 03:11:58.385
Both of you stay up and keep your eyes peeled.

03:11:58.385 --> 03:12:00.290
LAURA: I'm leaning my head on Fjord's shoulder.

03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:02.373
MATT: Aww. Okay.

03:12:02.373 --> 03:12:04.421
Do you want to both make perception checks for me, please?

03:12:04.421 --> 03:12:05.614
Or one of you will do the--

03:12:05.614 --> 03:12:06.911
TRAVIS: I will give her advantage.

03:12:06.911 --> 03:12:07.981
LAURA: Oh, really?

03:12:07.981 --> 03:12:09.204
TRAVIS: I think so.
LAURA: Okay.

03:12:09.204 --> 03:12:10.601
TRAVIS: I only have plus three.

03:12:10.601 --> 03:12:12.731
LAURA: Okay, mine's a little bit better.

03:12:12.731 --> 03:12:13.603
Perception?

03:12:13.603 --> 03:12:16.228
MATT: Perception with advantage.

03:12:16.228 --> 03:12:17.978
LAURA: Woo, woo, woo, woo!

03:12:19.110 --> 03:12:20.381
24!

03:12:20.381 --> 03:12:22.514
MATT: Nice, nice, not too bad.

03:12:23.881 --> 03:12:26.111
You both continue,

03:12:26.111 --> 03:12:28.941
enjoying the quiet proximity to each other,

03:12:28.941 --> 03:12:32.671
keeping eyes out amongst the dark freezing cold

03:12:32.671 --> 03:12:34.248
of which now the storm has blown in

03:12:34.248 --> 03:12:38.952
and you can see there is an ice fall.

03:12:38.952 --> 03:12:43.911
You can see smashing stones of hail,

03:12:43.911 --> 03:12:46.471
impacting and breaking against the dome above.

03:12:46.471 --> 03:12:49.275
And this faint pitter-patter.

03:12:49.275 --> 03:12:50.421
(pattering)

03:12:50.421 --> 03:12:52.061
And it's now this droning sound.

03:12:52.061 --> 03:12:53.911
You're all exhausted, and it doesn't wake any of you up,

03:12:53.911 --> 03:12:57.701
but it's weirdly comfortable.

03:12:57.701 --> 03:13:00.334
It's a lulling drone after a time, yeah,

03:13:01.321 --> 03:13:03.871
but it does begin to coat the outside of the dome

03:13:03.871 --> 03:13:06.421
and the ice begins to freeze up,

03:13:06.421 --> 03:13:09.661
and it's starting to obscure visual

03:13:09.661 --> 03:13:11.689
outside of the dome slightly.
LAURA: Okay.

03:13:11.689 --> 03:13:13.151
MATT: As is the nature of the storm.

03:13:13.151 --> 03:13:14.421
You're protected,

03:13:14.421 --> 03:13:18.521
but the ice fall is starting to coat the exterior.

03:13:18.521 --> 03:13:20.521
TRAVIS: Might need to tell the others to step outside

03:13:20.521 --> 03:13:22.441
to take a peek every once in a while.

03:13:22.441 --> 03:13:23.991
LAURA: Yeah.

03:13:23.991 --> 03:13:25.361
I'm not doing it.

03:13:25.361 --> 03:13:27.001
TRAVIS: No, no, that's why you take first watch.

03:13:27.001 --> 03:13:28.463
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

03:13:28.463 --> 03:13:29.612
That's a good idea.

03:13:31.841 --> 03:13:35.601
While we're waiting, towards the end of the first watch,

03:13:35.601 --> 03:13:40.601
can I pull out the tarot cards?

03:13:41.065 --> 03:13:42.341
MATT: Yeah.

03:13:42.341 --> 03:13:45.851
LAURA: And I'm going to stare at
the blank cards for a little bit,

03:13:45.851 --> 03:13:47.367
and then

03:13:50.267 --> 03:13:54.302
I want to make a card with Caduceus on it,

03:13:54.302 --> 03:13:57.041
I want to make a card with Caduceus on it,

03:13:57.041 --> 03:14:00.651
and I'm going to put Caduceus in the middle.

03:14:00.651 --> 03:14:04.831
And then at the bottom, at the bottom of the card,

03:14:04.831 --> 03:14:08.641
I'm going to put beautiful trees,

03:14:08.641 --> 03:14:12.971
like a forest that surrounds him growing,

03:14:12.971 --> 03:14:14.801
and then on the other side,

03:14:14.801 --> 03:14:19.522
I'm going to put the trees of the Savalirwood

03:14:19.522 --> 03:14:20.838
I'm going to put the trees of the Savalirwood

03:14:20.838 --> 03:14:23.921
and the trees that we saw underneath

03:14:25.261 --> 03:14:30.237
that are white and rotten and full of hatred.

03:14:30.237 --> 03:14:33.136
that are white and rotten and full of hatred.

03:14:34.991 --> 03:14:39.096
And then I'm going to write at the bottom "Growth,"

03:14:39.096 --> 03:14:41.959
and on the inverse I'm going to call it "Rot."

03:14:41.959 --> 03:14:44.421
MATT: Hmm, okay.

03:14:44.421 --> 03:14:45.537
MARISHA: That's dope.

03:14:47.821 --> 03:14:50.026
LAURA: That was fucked up in there.

03:14:50.026 --> 03:14:50.859
TRAVIS: Yes, it was.

03:14:52.141 --> 03:14:53.271
LAURA: I hope we can help Caduceus

03:14:53.271 --> 03:14:55.221
make everything better at his home, too.

03:14:56.361 --> 03:14:58.186
TRAVIS: If he's ready to go back.

03:14:58.186 --> 03:14:59.269
LAURA: Eventually.

03:15:05.754 --> 03:15:06.841
MATT: Okay.

03:15:06.841 --> 03:15:08.884
You finish your watch, uneventful.

03:15:10.161 --> 03:15:13.091
You go to rest, waking Caleb for the second watch.

03:15:13.091 --> 03:15:15.101
Caleb, if you can make a perception check for me, please.

03:15:15.101 --> 03:15:17.441
TRAVIS: I will tell them to go outside if you want to look.

03:15:17.441 --> 03:15:18.274
LIAM: Hmm?

03:15:18.274 --> 03:15:20.121
TRAVIS: Oh, go outside if you want to look.

03:15:20.121 --> 03:15:21.851
It's sort of covered the dome.

03:15:21.851 --> 03:15:22.684
MATT: As you do wake up,

03:15:22.684 --> 03:15:24.431
it does look like the interior of an igloo.

03:15:24.431 --> 03:15:26.874
It is just a solid white snow.

03:15:27.811 --> 03:15:28.691
LIAM: Top as well?

03:15:28.691 --> 03:15:30.321
MATT: Top as well, yeah.

03:15:30.321 --> 03:15:32.781
TRAVIS: Yeah, just sort of covered in the night.

03:15:32.781 --> 03:15:34.989
Super bummer about that.
LIAM: Before they fall asleep,

03:15:34.989 --> 03:15:38.551
I just stick my arm only out through the top

03:15:38.551 --> 03:15:41.801
to see if I feel cold air or snow.

03:15:41.801 --> 03:15:43.381
MATT: Freezing cold, you do feel air,

03:15:43.381 --> 03:15:46.347
but it's about six or seven inches before you get to it.

03:15:46.347 --> 03:15:47.180
TRAVIS: Whew.

03:15:48.393 --> 03:15:49.801
MATT: And when your hand comes out,

03:15:49.801 --> 03:15:52.161
you can feel the snow fall on your hand.

03:15:52.161 --> 03:15:55.531
It's not a blizzard, but it is a snowstorm coming through.

03:15:55.531 --> 03:15:57.992
LIAM: Okay, I grab Frumpkin by the scruff,

03:15:57.992 --> 03:15:59.061
and then I put him under the butt,

03:15:59.061 --> 03:16:01.321
and I go, (blows heavily).

03:16:01.321 --> 03:16:02.154
MATT: Out the top?

03:16:02.154 --> 03:16:03.551
TRAVIS: Oh right, he can't leave.

03:16:03.551 --> 03:16:05.621
LAURA: Mm-mm.
TRAVIS: Right, fuck.

03:16:05.621 --> 03:16:09.631
LIAM: And just look around to see if there's anything bad.

03:16:09.631 --> 03:16:10.464
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: In Frumpkin's eyes.

03:16:10.464 --> 03:16:12.651
Make a perception check with disadvantage,

03:16:12.651 --> 03:16:13.963
because he doesn't have darkvision.

03:16:13.963 --> 03:16:15.263
LIAM: Oh, that'll be terrible.

03:16:16.471 --> 03:16:17.691
Nine, probably, nine.

03:16:17.691 --> 03:16:20.041
MATT: You feel pretty confident there's no problems.

03:16:20.041 --> 03:16:21.096
LIAM: Okay.

03:16:21.096 --> 03:16:24.261
TRAVIS: (laughs) What a shitty way to say that.

03:16:24.261 --> 03:16:26.635
LIAM: Okay, he's never failed us before, so I think--

03:16:26.635 --> 03:16:28.935
(laughter)

03:16:28.935 --> 03:16:30.321
All right, good night, get some sleep.

03:16:30.321 --> 03:16:31.154
LAURA: Good night.

03:16:32.771 --> 03:16:35.759
LIAM: Do you think that you would snuggle?

03:16:36.911 --> 03:16:38.091
LAURA: I'd be leaning against him.

03:16:38.091 --> 03:16:39.070
LIAM: Lean against him?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:16:39.070 --> 03:16:39.903
LIAM: Okay.

03:16:41.631 --> 03:16:42.951
So then I would just sit down

03:16:42.951 --> 03:16:45.854
and take Frumpkin into Caleb's lap,

03:16:46.771 --> 03:16:50.179
and once they dozed off, silently,

03:16:50.179 --> 03:16:53.628
just a little recognition.

03:17:01.381 --> 03:17:04.624
And I scoop Frumpkin up onto my shoulders like a scarf,

03:17:06.201 --> 03:17:09.174
and just look out through the hole at the top,

03:17:10.321 --> 03:17:12.331
and wait and pass my time.

03:17:12.331 --> 03:17:13.164
MATT: Okay.

03:17:15.261 --> 03:17:19.871
You finish your watch, and completing that,

03:17:19.871 --> 03:17:22.904
you wake up Caduceus to take final watch.

03:17:25.091 --> 03:17:27.848
LIAM: Big guy. It's cold.
TALIESIN: All right.

03:17:30.581 --> 03:17:33.531
Actually, will you lift my cat as high as you can

03:17:33.531 --> 03:17:34.364
up through the dome?

03:17:34.364 --> 03:17:35.791
TALIESIN: All right, miss me.

03:17:35.791 --> 03:17:37.172
No, that's fine.

03:17:37.172 --> 03:17:38.005
MARISHA: (chuckles)

03:17:38.005 --> 03:17:39.911
LIAM: I hold his arm and look around

03:17:39.911 --> 03:17:41.561
like it's a submarine periscope.

03:17:41.561 --> 03:17:43.186
MARISHA: Submarine cat, yeah, perfect.

03:17:43.186 --> 03:17:44.621
(chuckling)

03:17:44.621 --> 03:17:45.964
LIAM: Turn your arm around a bit.

03:17:45.964 --> 03:17:46.797
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

03:17:46.797 --> 03:17:48.293
MARISHA: A catascope.

03:17:48.293 --> 03:17:49.376
ASHLEY: (chuckles)

03:17:50.511 --> 03:17:51.344
LIAM: Yeah.

03:17:54.601 --> 03:17:56.101
At disadvantage.

03:17:57.671 --> 03:17:59.414
Woo, 14.

03:18:00.691 --> 03:18:01.971
MATT: Okay, at the end of your watch,

03:18:01.971 --> 03:18:03.001
as you're transitioning over,

03:18:03.001 --> 03:18:04.971
you don't see anything that catches your attention, yeah.

03:18:04.971 --> 03:18:06.321
LIAM: All right, thank you.

03:18:08.527 --> 03:18:09.914
(exhales heavily)

03:18:09.914 --> 03:18:11.842
MATT: Okay.

03:18:11.842 --> 03:18:13.431
With Caleb going to sleep,

03:18:13.431 --> 03:18:16.231
the rest of the interior of this is quiet,

03:18:16.231 --> 03:18:19.341
except for the occasional bout of snoring from,

03:18:19.341 --> 03:18:23.844
well, probably a combination of Dagen and Yasha.

03:18:24.761 --> 03:18:29.741
The cold weather has been rough on your nostrils up here.

03:18:29.741 --> 03:18:33.061
But in order to take a watch,

03:18:33.061 --> 03:18:34.561
you'd have to push through some of the snow.

03:18:34.561 --> 03:18:37.854
TALIESIN: Well, here's a question, how tall is the dome?

03:18:39.021 --> 03:18:40.251
SAM: 20 feet, right?

03:18:40.251 --> 03:18:41.861
Because in a 20-foot radius?

03:18:41.861 --> 03:18:44.134
LIAM: It's wide, but it's not super high.

03:18:45.071 --> 03:18:46.471
SAM: It's not a circle?

03:18:46.471 --> 03:18:49.023
MARISHA: I want this to be real, just--

03:18:49.023 --> 03:18:50.274
Yeah.

03:18:50.274 --> 03:18:52.834
Those cupcakes that you can get?
LAURA: I don't think it's a 20-foot radius.

03:18:52.834 --> 03:18:53.748
LIAM: 10-foot radius.
SAM: It's a 10-foot radius,

03:18:53.748 --> 03:18:55.031
so it's a 10 foot...

03:18:55.031 --> 03:18:56.161
MATT: It is, yeah.
LAURA: Snuggled in.

03:18:56.161 --> 03:18:57.349
MATT: 10-foot tall, yeah.

03:18:57.349 --> 03:18:58.969
TALIESIN: So I'm just going to take a step forward

03:18:58.969 --> 03:19:01.951
until my head just peeks out of it.

03:19:01.951 --> 03:19:03.681
MATT: Okay, so you step forward.

03:19:03.681 --> 03:19:05.691
TALIESIN: If I get cold, I just lean back.

03:19:05.691 --> 03:19:09.133
MATT: You just go face first into a pillow of snow.

03:19:09.133 --> 03:19:10.221
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

03:19:10.221 --> 03:19:12.601
MATT: It is freezing cold in your
face, immediately going numb,

03:19:12.601 --> 03:19:13.891
trying to brush it out of your face,

03:19:13.891 --> 03:19:15.201
and it tumbles down,

03:19:15.201 --> 03:19:16.721
and some of the snow above the dome,

03:19:16.721 --> 03:19:18.291
as you push through slides down

03:19:18.291 --> 03:19:20.131
and begins to bury over the top a bit,

03:19:20.131 --> 03:19:23.931
until eventually you push it all off of you, push it,

03:19:23.931 --> 03:19:25.201
you eventually carve through

03:19:25.201 --> 03:19:26.921
and you look like a person whose face hit a cake.

03:19:26.921 --> 03:19:29.541
You're just like all over.

03:19:29.541 --> 03:19:32.111
Eventually you look out into the darkness around you.

03:19:32.111 --> 03:19:33.476
You do not have darkvision.
TALIESIN: No.

03:19:33.476 --> 03:19:36.131
MATT: So make a perception check at disadvantage, please.

03:19:36.131 --> 03:19:38.261
TALIESIN: And I'm actually going to give myself,

03:19:38.261 --> 03:19:42.678
just going to be hitting myself with some extra mojo.

03:19:43.708 --> 03:19:46.771
Oh, terrible for me, 14.

03:19:46.771 --> 03:19:48.491
MATT: 14, okay.

03:19:48.491 --> 03:19:52.041
It's hard to see, with both the heavier snowfall,

03:19:52.041 --> 03:19:54.431
the cold temperature, the wind blowing,

03:19:54.431 --> 03:19:57.721
and the lack of any light source in the vicinity,

03:19:57.721 --> 03:19:59.058
glancing about.

03:20:01.321 --> 03:20:02.431
Don't see anything.
TALIESIN: Suppose the closer

03:20:02.431 --> 03:20:03.523
the sun gets to us,

03:20:03.523 --> 03:20:04.751
the more I'll be able to see stuff.

03:20:04.751 --> 03:20:06.168
MATT: Probably, yeah.

03:20:08.410 --> 03:20:13.410
So, about six hours into this

03:20:13.581 --> 03:20:15.261
keeping your eyes out,

03:20:15.261 --> 03:20:17.001
the light begins to shift ever so slightly

03:20:17.001 --> 03:20:18.431
since you guys did get a late start

03:20:18.431 --> 03:20:20.531
before resting into the evening,

03:20:20.531 --> 03:20:22.611
and it is an eight hours of full rest are needed

03:20:22.611 --> 03:20:25.108
before you can complete your rest

03:20:25.108 --> 03:20:26.458
and get the benefits of it.

03:20:28.651 --> 03:20:30.751
About six hours into it, the sun begins to rise,

03:20:30.751 --> 03:20:32.651
and a little bit of light begins to come through.

03:20:32.651 --> 03:20:34.791
It seems that the snowfall has lessened.

03:20:34.791 --> 03:20:37.841
The heaviness of the night storm has passed over,

03:20:37.841 --> 03:20:39.841
and it's more of just a gentle flutter,

03:20:39.841 --> 03:20:43.521
but it still left a soft powder around.

03:20:43.521 --> 03:20:47.731
You push through and glance through the snow,

03:20:47.731 --> 03:20:52.641
and it's, you know, that beautiful early sunrise coloration

03:20:52.641 --> 03:20:54.691
begins to carve through, the gray sky breaks a bit,

03:20:54.691 --> 03:20:58.441
and you can see that orangish golden hue

03:20:58.441 --> 03:20:59.671
that's rimmed with red

03:20:59.671 --> 03:21:01.914
just breaking over the distant mountains.

03:21:03.561 --> 03:21:06.211
And take a deep cold breath of morning air,

03:21:06.211 --> 03:21:09.791
and glance about, and glance over there,

03:21:09.791 --> 03:21:13.211
and you see, sitting in the snow across the way,

03:21:13.211 --> 03:21:18.211
a purple-skinned figure with horns sitting there

03:21:18.689 --> 03:21:20.041
looks like he's taking the dirt out

03:21:20.041 --> 03:21:23.371
from under his fingernails and his heavy furred cloak.

03:21:23.371 --> 03:21:24.761
And looks up.

03:21:24.761 --> 03:21:25.594
TALIESIN: Damn it.
MATT: "Ah!

03:21:25.594 --> 03:21:28.209
I was wondering when you'd awaken."

03:21:28.209 --> 03:21:29.442
TALIESIN: I've been awake.

03:21:30.451 --> 03:21:31.721
MATT: "Well."

03:21:31.721 --> 03:21:36.054
TALIESIN: I just was-- I was busy. This is nice.

03:21:36.911 --> 03:21:39.011
MATT: Snaps his fingers and you see shifting around,

03:21:39.011 --> 03:21:39.881
a few other figures

03:21:39.881 --> 03:21:42.771
that have been settled around this dome.

03:21:42.771 --> 03:21:43.604
SAM: Is the dome still--

03:21:43.604 --> 03:21:44.437
The dome's still up?

03:21:44.437 --> 03:21:45.270
MATT: The dome's still up, yeah.

03:21:45.270 --> 03:21:46.181
SAM: It's just his watch now?

03:21:46.181 --> 03:21:48.031
MATT: It's just him poking his head out of it right now.

03:21:48.031 --> 03:21:50.054
Part of his watch.
SAM: Oh god.

03:21:51.160 --> 03:21:52.993
TALIESIN: It's a nice sunrise.

03:21:53.951 --> 03:21:55.531
MATT: "I agree.

03:21:55.531 --> 03:21:59.448
"We'll take a moment and appreciate it together."

03:22:00.436 --> 03:22:02.051
TALIESIN: Eh, give me a minute.

03:22:02.051 --> 03:22:02.986
I sit down.

03:22:02.986 --> 03:22:04.281
LAURA: (chuckles)

03:22:04.281 --> 03:22:06.514
TALIESIN: Hey, we got a problem.

03:22:11.181 --> 03:22:13.241
LAURA: Does this mean we don't get a long rest if we've--

03:22:13.241 --> 03:22:14.491
MATT: You have not completed a long rest.

03:22:14.491 --> 03:22:16.838
SAM: Oh, shit!
LIAM: (groans)

03:22:16.838 --> 03:22:18.434
TRAVIS: We got a short rest though, right?

03:22:19.596 --> 03:22:20.429
MARISHA: Shit.

03:22:20.429 --> 03:22:21.470
MATT: I'll say yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:22:21.470 --> 03:22:24.801
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.
LAURA: I hit my long rest button.

03:22:24.801 --> 03:22:25.634
MARISHA: I did, too.

03:22:25.634 --> 03:22:27.554
SAM: I did, too. I think I can undo it.

03:22:28.501 --> 03:22:30.488
MARISHA: But I remember--
SAM: I mean, I think I remember.

03:22:30.488 --> 03:22:33.513
I know what I had and used.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:22:34.926 --> 03:22:36.538
TALIESIN: (sighs)

03:22:36.538 --> 03:22:37.371
LIAM: Damn it.

03:22:37.371 --> 03:22:39.831
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

03:22:39.831 --> 03:22:41.566
I was at 80 hit points.

03:22:46.141 --> 03:22:48.711
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to stand back up.

03:22:48.711 --> 03:22:49.611
MATT: As you peek out,

03:22:49.611 --> 03:22:52.421
you can see now Lucien's leaning against the dome.

03:22:52.421 --> 03:22:53.571
Most of the snow's been kicked off,

03:22:53.571 --> 03:22:54.691
and is to your side

03:22:54.691 --> 03:22:55.810
where your head pokes through

03:22:55.810 --> 03:22:58.458
and he's looking over at the sunrise

03:22:58.458 --> 03:22:59.458
and smiling.

03:23:00.401 --> 03:23:01.576
TALIESIN: I needed that.

03:23:04.441 --> 03:23:06.071
MATT: "Occasionally you get a good pretty one.

03:23:06.071 --> 03:23:10.311
"Not always, but right now it's worth appreciating."

03:23:10.311 --> 03:23:12.161
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was a rough day yesterday.

03:23:14.631 --> 03:23:17.321
MATT: "This whole landscape is made of rough days."

03:23:17.321 --> 03:23:18.471
TALIESIN: It's got its moments.

03:23:20.863 --> 03:23:22.213
How was your day yesterday?

03:23:23.501 --> 03:23:24.511
MATT: "Exhausted.

03:23:24.511 --> 03:23:25.344
"Not a lot of sleep, you know,

03:23:25.344 --> 03:23:29.339
"when you're trying to catch up to some folks that--"

03:23:29.339 --> 03:23:31.221
TALIESIN: (chuckles)

03:23:31.221 --> 03:23:32.721
MATT: "-- seem to be overachievers."

03:23:32.721 --> 03:23:35.824
TALIESIN: Well, they're industrious.

03:23:35.824 --> 03:23:38.201
MATT: "(chuckles)"

03:23:38.201 --> 03:23:42.201
TALIESIN: We've never technically met
before, really, by the way.

03:23:42.201 --> 03:23:43.511
I don't know if you know that.

03:23:43.511 --> 03:23:45.771
MATT: "I don't think I've technically met most of you,

03:23:45.771 --> 03:23:47.151
"just the blue one."

03:23:47.151 --> 03:23:50.581
TALIESIN: Well, I don't have any previous experience

03:23:50.581 --> 03:23:52.731
with anybody who looks like you,

03:23:52.731 --> 03:23:53.961
I suppose would be how I'd put it.

03:23:53.961 --> 03:23:56.111
MATT: "Oh, right, right, yeah, the weird period.

03:23:56.111 --> 03:23:58.677
"Don't worry about it."

03:23:58.677 --> 03:24:03.108
TALIESIN: It occupies a lot of the thoughts of my friends,

03:24:04.721 --> 03:24:05.744
but not me.

03:24:08.631 --> 03:24:09.464
For the record.

03:24:13.441 --> 03:24:14.854
So did you go down there?

03:24:17.011 --> 03:24:17.861
MATT: "Didn't have to.

03:24:20.581 --> 03:24:24.371
"Apparently, you all found what we were looking for,

03:24:24.371 --> 03:24:26.831
"and went rushing off.

03:24:26.831 --> 03:24:30.211
"So twice now we've changed our trajectory,

03:24:30.211 --> 03:24:31.531
"trying to keep up with you."

03:24:31.531 --> 03:24:32.991
TALIESIN: (chuckles)

03:24:32.991 --> 03:24:35.281
Really, where were you headed?

03:24:35.281 --> 03:24:36.331
MATT: "Same place, originally."

03:24:36.331 --> 03:24:38.770
TALIESIN: Oh, you just had a--

03:24:38.770 --> 03:24:42.015
there was a lot of discussion about that, so.

03:24:42.015 --> 03:24:42.848
MATT: "Yeah.

03:24:42.848 --> 03:24:44.831
"Not going to lie, kind of impressed."

03:24:44.831 --> 03:24:45.664
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:24:46.773 --> 03:24:48.316
That means something.

03:24:50.801 --> 03:24:54.321
MATT: "We've all not really had much of a meal, not slept."

03:24:54.321 --> 03:24:55.221
TALIESIN: No.

03:24:55.221 --> 03:24:56.431
MATT: "I think it's time for a discussion,

03:24:56.431 --> 03:24:58.281
"if you don't mind getting the
rest of your friends up there."

03:24:58.281 --> 03:25:00.451
TALIESIN: Oh, they're getting up.

03:25:00.451 --> 03:25:01.284
MATT: "Good, good."

03:25:03.021 --> 03:25:05.234
TALIESIN: You know, no sense making a thing of it.

03:25:07.861 --> 03:25:08.811
MATT: "What's your deal?"

03:25:10.491 --> 03:25:12.916
TALIESIN: You know, I had an answer to that

03:25:12.916 --> 03:25:14.132
a couple days ago.

03:25:16.761 --> 03:25:17.971
I don't know anymore.

03:25:17.971 --> 03:25:21.224
I got some ideas, but I'm not sure.

03:25:23.031 --> 03:25:24.621
Does that make sense?

03:25:24.621 --> 03:25:26.491
MATT: "Ambition but no direction?"

03:25:26.491 --> 03:25:27.501
TALIESIN: Ambition's a big word.

03:25:27.501 --> 03:25:32.501
I suppose direction, but confused ambition.

03:25:33.121 --> 03:25:35.096
No, not even ambition, that's weird.

03:25:35.096 --> 03:25:38.487
MATT: "'Confused ambition.' Would you call that curiosity?"

03:25:41.211 --> 03:25:42.211
TALIESIN: I'm trying to figure out

03:25:42.211 --> 03:25:47.011
what kind of fruit I'm supposed to grow,

03:25:47.011 --> 03:25:48.094
if that makes sense.

03:25:49.611 --> 03:25:50.793
MATT: "Strange analogy."

03:25:50.793 --> 03:25:52.181
TALIESIN: Well, I'm supposed to--

03:25:52.181 --> 03:25:54.151
I think I'm supposed to do something for this world,

03:25:54.151 --> 03:25:56.704
and I'm just not entirely sure what it's supposed to be.

03:25:58.156 --> 03:25:59.830
MATT: "Maybe our paths aren't too far off anyway."

03:25:59.830 --> 03:26:00.663
TALIESIN: Huh.

03:26:02.153 --> 03:26:03.779
People are people.

03:26:03.779 --> 03:26:04.779
MATT: "Hmm."

03:26:07.435 --> 03:26:09.118
TALIESIN: (grunts)

03:26:09.118 --> 03:26:12.141
MATT: "At the very least--"
TALIESIN: If you want,

03:26:12.141 --> 03:26:14.544
yeah, soon as you guys are ready, we should eat.

03:26:17.211 --> 03:26:18.461
SAM: Hey,

03:26:20.727 --> 03:26:23.584
if we just keep resting--

03:26:23.584 --> 03:26:25.641
TRAVIS: (laughs) Keep sleeping?

03:26:25.641 --> 03:26:30.621
SAM: I mean, I know it'll be hard, but could you meditate?

03:26:30.621 --> 03:26:32.531
And some of us can stay up.

03:26:32.531 --> 03:26:35.381
I don't mind staying up and talking strategy and stuff,

03:26:35.381 --> 03:26:38.211
but if you guys, magic-y people want to

03:26:38.211 --> 03:26:39.879
meditate and rest,

03:26:39.879 --> 03:26:42.011
it's okay with me.
TRAVIS: I'm okay to stay.

03:26:42.011 --> 03:26:43.573
MARISHA: Your dome is about to go, right?

03:26:43.573 --> 03:26:44.888
I don't mind staying up.

03:26:44.888 --> 03:26:46.911
MATT: You have two more hours of the dome.

03:26:46.911 --> 03:26:48.871
TALIESIN: That's a long to wait.
TRAVIS: Unless he dispels it

03:26:48.871 --> 03:26:50.021
or does something else.
LAURA: Well.

03:26:50.021 --> 03:26:51.031
TRAVIS: Impatiently.

03:26:51.031 --> 03:26:51.864
MARISHA: Well, what is he going to do

03:26:51.864 --> 03:26:54.061
if he can't get in the dome, right?

03:26:54.061 --> 03:26:55.356
So why not?
TRAVIS: Can he?

03:26:55.356 --> 03:26:57.005
LAURA: Why not just say--
TRAVIS: Can he?

03:26:57.005 --> 03:26:58.471
MARISHA: Unless--
LIAM: We don't know, but--

03:26:58.471 --> 03:26:59.521
TALIESIN: He got all those damn eyes.

03:26:59.521 --> 03:27:01.731
What if one of them flashes, and it's like-- (crumbling)?

03:27:01.731 --> 03:27:02.781
MARISHA: You're right, yeah.

03:27:02.781 --> 03:27:03.684
LAURA: But we can try.

03:27:03.684 --> 03:27:05.794
TRAVIS: We can try.

03:27:05.794 --> 03:27:08.729
I only needed a short rest; I can stay up.

03:27:09.579 --> 03:27:12.001
MARISHA: Yeah, I can be okay with a short rest.

03:27:12.001 --> 03:27:14.691
SAM: We can strategize while you meditate.

03:27:14.691 --> 03:27:16.921
LAURA: Here's the thing: they can hear you guys.

03:27:16.921 --> 03:27:18.001
The dome is not soundproof.

03:27:18.001 --> 03:27:19.719
SAM: We'll speak in Thieves' Can't.
TRAVIS: I thought it was.

03:27:19.719 --> 03:27:20.552
LAURA: Nope.

03:27:20.552 --> 03:27:21.628
MATT: Its not soundproof.

03:27:21.628 --> 03:27:23.791
There is a layer of snow around most of it,

03:27:23.791 --> 03:27:25.751
except for where Caduceus and Lucien

03:27:25.751 --> 03:27:27.601
have created--
MARISHA: I do know Halfling.

03:27:27.601 --> 03:27:30.943
MATT: -- created Taliesin angels in the snow,

03:27:30.943 --> 03:27:31.836
I guess we'd call them.

03:27:31.836 --> 03:27:33.128
MARISHA: Oh, you know Halfling? You're a halfling.

03:27:33.128 --> 03:27:35.014
LIAM: She is a halfling.
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, okay.

03:27:36.351 --> 03:27:38.821
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean I can stay up, too.

03:27:38.821 --> 03:27:40.491
TRAVIS: And they're just sitting on the

03:27:40.491 --> 03:27:42.701
literal outside of the dome, like outside of a tent.

03:27:42.701 --> 03:27:44.821
TALIESIN: I'm standing in it.
MATT: Yeah, they're just waiting.

03:27:44.821 --> 03:27:46.271
TALIESIN: Leaning.

03:27:46.271 --> 03:27:49.281
MARISHA: I look at Veth and I say in Halfling--

03:27:49.281 --> 03:27:51.261
TRAVIS: Keep sleeping.
LAURA: I'm going to keep sleeping.

03:27:51.261 --> 03:27:53.351
MARISHA: Do you think he understands Halfling?

03:27:53.351 --> 03:27:56.446
SAM: I don't know if he understands Halfling.

03:27:56.446 --> 03:27:57.279
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:27:57.279 --> 03:27:58.684
What if-- we could test it.

03:28:00.441 --> 03:28:02.741
I'll tell you a joke or something in Halfling.

03:28:02.741 --> 03:28:04.211
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: If he laughs--

03:28:04.211 --> 03:28:06.021
MARISHA: Then we know?
SAM: Then we know.

03:28:06.021 --> 03:28:07.521
MARISHA: What if it's just a
shitty joke and he doesn't laugh?

03:28:07.521 --> 03:28:09.455
SAM: Oh, it's going to be a shitty joke.

03:28:09.455 --> 03:28:10.691
(laughter)

03:28:10.691 --> 03:28:12.191
TRAVIS: Digging deep into something.

03:28:13.188 --> 03:28:14.541
ASHLEY: You have jokes written down?

03:28:14.541 --> 03:28:16.671
SAM: I do. (laughs)

03:28:16.671 --> 03:28:17.504
MATT: Of course you do.

03:28:17.504 --> 03:28:19.221
SAM: For my Hideous Laughter spell.

03:28:19.221 --> 03:28:20.241
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:28:20.241 --> 03:28:23.971
SAM: I have one that I wrote down maybe six months ago.

03:28:23.971 --> 03:28:24.804
Okay, ready?

03:28:24.804 --> 03:28:28.591
In Halfling, I'll say: What did Captain Tusktooth say

03:28:28.591 --> 03:28:30.674
when he forgot how to captain the ship?

03:28:31.851 --> 03:28:33.181
MARISHA: I don't know, what did he say?

03:28:33.181 --> 03:28:35.857
SAM: Long time, no <i>sea.</i>

03:28:35.857 --> 03:28:40.434
MARISHA: (laughs loudly)

03:28:40.434 --> 03:28:41.853
MATT: You don't hear any reaction.

03:28:41.853 --> 03:28:42.695
(laughter)

03:28:42.695 --> 03:28:44.781
TRAVIS: For one reason or the other.

03:28:44.781 --> 03:28:47.681
MATT: Though you do hear a mild groan

03:28:47.681 --> 03:28:49.600
from a voice you don't recognize

03:28:49.600 --> 03:28:51.957
on the other side of the outside of the dome.

03:28:51.957 --> 03:28:52.927
SAM: One of them speaks Halfling!

03:28:52.927 --> 03:28:54.221
MARISHA: One of them speaks Halfling.
SAM: Successful test.

03:28:54.221 --> 03:28:55.692
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:28:55.692 --> 03:28:58.071
(laughter)

03:28:58.071 --> 03:28:59.895
MARISHA: That's right, because doesn't he have a halfling?

03:28:59.895 --> 03:29:01.685
One of them is a halfling.
SAM: Oh, shit. I should've known that.

03:29:01.685 --> 03:29:04.478
(laughter)

03:29:04.478 --> 03:29:07.081
TALIESIN: Does anybody want me
to say anything, or am I just--

03:29:07.081 --> 03:29:09.358
I dipped, just going to go out.

03:29:09.358 --> 03:29:11.241
All right, I'm just going to go out.

03:29:11.241 --> 03:29:13.338
MARISHA: You need to keep resting.
LAURA: Don't--!

03:29:13.338 --> 03:29:15.583
TALIESIN: I've been up for--

03:29:15.583 --> 03:29:17.570
MARISHA: But do you need your other rest?

03:29:17.570 --> 03:29:19.376
Like, your other two hours?

03:29:20.511 --> 03:29:22.871
TALIESIN: Technically speaking, I would have hit my point,

03:29:22.871 --> 03:29:24.541
because I was taking the last shift anyway.

03:29:24.541 --> 03:29:26.911
So would I have hit my--?

03:29:26.911 --> 03:29:27.744
I know it's very--

03:29:27.744 --> 03:29:29.232
MATT: It's a bit fiddly because the idea is

03:29:29.232 --> 03:29:31.315
it's eight hours of rest.

03:29:32.182 --> 03:29:34.131
Two hours of it can be spent on watch,

03:29:34.131 --> 03:29:36.731
but it's still an eight hour period of rest.

03:29:36.731 --> 03:29:38.931
TALIESIN: So I can't do anything for another two hours,

03:29:38.931 --> 03:29:40.514
as long as I just, like, chill.

03:29:40.514 --> 03:29:41.464
MATT: You can do things,

03:29:41.464 --> 03:29:43.278
you just don't regain all the spells that you would have.

03:29:43.278 --> 03:29:45.119
TALIESIN: Yeah, unless, yeah, so.

03:29:45.119 --> 03:29:46.727
MARISHA: Unless you chill.

03:29:48.521 --> 03:29:52.099
TALIESIN: I mean, it'd be weird if I weren't out there.

03:29:53.071 --> 03:29:54.454
LAURA: I wouldn't go out there.

03:29:55.536 --> 03:29:57.944
MARISHA: We just want to wait, just wait it out.

03:29:59.661 --> 03:30:01.261
What are they going to do?

03:30:01.261 --> 03:30:03.081
They could do a million things, like Fjord said,

03:30:03.081 --> 03:30:03.914
but I don't know.

03:30:03.914 --> 03:30:04.930
ASHLEY: Yeah, we could just try to sleep,

03:30:04.930 --> 03:30:06.661
and then if they (snaps fingers)

03:30:06.661 --> 03:30:08.674
then we're out there with them.

03:30:09.541 --> 03:30:11.004
MARISHA: I'll stay up, I'm good.

03:30:12.721 --> 03:30:13.821
TALIESIN: You want to let them know, or?

03:30:13.821 --> 03:30:14.871
I'll let them know.

03:30:15.711 --> 03:30:18.024
MARISHA: I mean, sure.

03:30:20.349 --> 03:30:22.091
I don't think he's going to go for it.

03:30:22.091 --> 03:30:22.924
TALIESIN: No.

03:30:24.191 --> 03:30:25.291
I guess we can just,

03:30:25.291 --> 03:30:27.454
yeah, it just feels rude, I don't know.

03:30:29.121 --> 03:30:30.380
MARISHA: Rude?!

03:30:30.380 --> 03:30:32.221
SAM: (laughs)

03:30:32.221 --> 03:30:34.446
TALIESIN: I dipped my toe into the world

03:30:34.446 --> 03:30:36.246
of deceit and ill intention

03:30:36.246 --> 03:30:37.922
and it did not turn out well.

03:30:37.922 --> 03:30:39.858
(laughter)

03:30:39.858 --> 03:30:40.694
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:30:42.861 --> 03:30:45.771
TALIESIN: I knew I would pick up
some bad habits with you all,

03:30:45.771 --> 03:30:47.761
but this feels like a step too far.

03:30:47.761 --> 03:30:50.191
I feel like I've wandered too far off the path.

03:30:50.191 --> 03:30:51.741
MARISHA: Well, we've picked up plenty of good habits

03:30:51.741 --> 03:30:55.677
from you, so it balances out, yeah.
TALIESIN: It's give and take, but--

03:30:55.677 --> 03:30:57.871
MATT: (deep voice) "Hey, Nonagon, they awake or what?"

03:30:57.871 --> 03:31:00.651
You hear another voice coming through, it's like,

03:31:00.651 --> 03:31:02.531
(as Lucien) "They're rousing, they're rousing.

03:31:02.531 --> 03:31:04.601
"Be patient, eat your jerky.

03:31:04.601 --> 03:31:09.214
"Don't want any untoward behavior unearned yet, Zoran."

03:31:10.531 --> 03:31:12.271
SAM: Zoran, did we know that name?

03:31:12.271 --> 03:31:14.268
LAURA: Yeah, there's one named Zoran.

03:31:15.291 --> 03:31:17.732
SAM: Oh, that's the goliath, maybe?

03:31:17.732 --> 03:31:18.673
LAURA: There's--

03:31:19.951 --> 03:31:22.341
SAM: I only have "Lucien, Cree."

03:31:22.341 --> 03:31:25.701
MARISHA: I shuffle to the edge of the dome, pop my head out.

03:31:25.701 --> 03:31:28.794
LAURA: Tyffial, Cree, Zoran, Otis.

03:31:29.851 --> 03:31:30.684
And Lucien.

03:31:30.684 --> 03:31:31.731
MARISHA: Lucien.

03:31:31.731 --> 03:31:33.095
Hi, good morning.

03:31:33.095 --> 03:31:35.122
TRAVIS: Oh shit, we're going.

03:31:35.122 --> 03:31:35.955
MATT: "Morning."

03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:39.751
MARISHA: If you could just give us a little bit of time,

03:31:39.751 --> 03:31:44.751
we're going to brush our teeth, maybe brew some tea.

03:31:44.878 --> 03:31:47.703
MATT: Okay, turns around, looks towards you, goes,

03:31:47.703 --> 03:31:49.078
"Oh, I'm sorry, you all resting?

03:31:49.078 --> 03:31:51.176
You have a nice night's sleep?"

03:31:52.231 --> 03:31:54.391
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, we would like to continue our rest,

03:31:54.391 --> 03:31:58.251
unless you're in some sort of astronomical hurry.

03:31:58.251 --> 03:31:59.641
MATT: "Of course, of course,

03:31:59.641 --> 03:32:00.951
"we're happy to wait here for a bit.

03:32:00.951 --> 03:32:01.784
"I figure, you know,

03:32:01.784 --> 03:32:04.504
"we've only trudged through a night in the dark,

03:32:06.021 --> 03:32:07.251
"trying to catch up to and your group

03:32:07.251 --> 03:32:09.351
"for grabbing the thing that we were after."

03:32:10.651 --> 03:32:11.941
MARISHA: Grabbing the thing you were after.

03:32:11.941 --> 03:32:16.173
MATT: "Well, you all got extremely, how do I put it,

03:32:17.541 --> 03:32:20.021
"eager to not walk the path I left for you,

03:32:20.021 --> 03:32:22.351
"instead cut us off at the pass.

03:32:22.351 --> 03:32:26.681
"And you know what, I appreciate initiative.

03:32:26.681 --> 03:32:29.901
"But unfortunately I can't say

03:32:29.901 --> 03:32:32.848
that we're really in a mood for
waiting that much longer, so..."

03:32:32.848 --> 03:32:34.831
And you watch as the eye on the chest

03:32:34.831 --> 03:32:37.667
flares bright for a second and the dome

03:32:37.667 --> 03:32:38.500
MATT: (puffs heavily)
SAM: Fuck!

03:32:38.500 --> 03:32:40.229
MATT: -- vanishes.
SAM: He fucking did the thing!

03:32:40.229 --> 03:32:43.405
MATT: All the snow falls on top of all of you.

03:32:43.405 --> 03:32:45.988
(groaning)

03:32:47.291 --> 03:32:49.031
SAM: It was Iver. He did it!

03:32:49.031 --> 03:32:51.231
It was his idea!
MATT: Iver's like, "What?!"

03:32:51.231 --> 03:32:52.638
"Who are you, what's going on?

03:32:52.638 --> 03:32:54.660
"Who are these people?"

03:32:54.660 --> 03:32:56.577
TALIESIN: I tried to tell them.

03:32:57.561 --> 03:32:58.931
MARISHA: Well, Lucien,

03:33:01.361 --> 03:33:03.891
from my memory or at least where I come from,

03:33:03.891 --> 03:33:08.321
invitations are suggested.

03:33:08.321 --> 03:33:10.981
You can take them or you can leave them.

03:33:10.981 --> 03:33:13.961
So while we did not follow along the path--

03:33:13.961 --> 03:33:15.691
LIAM: We're covered in snow. We're waking up.

03:33:15.691 --> 03:33:18.257
MARISHA: -- that you laid out for us.

03:33:18.257 --> 03:33:20.381
TALIESIN: (grunts)

03:33:20.381 --> 03:33:21.974
SAM: (quietly) We'll stall for two more hours.

03:33:21.974 --> 03:33:24.381
MARISHA: Seems like it's a free tundra, right?

03:33:24.381 --> 03:33:29.031
I didn't know, and you made no claim of...

03:33:30.731 --> 03:33:32.039
this crest,

03:33:32.039 --> 03:33:36.104
so I'm not entirely sure what you're so upset about.

03:33:37.061 --> 03:33:38.961
MATT: "I'm not upset. Do I appear upset?"

03:33:38.961 --> 03:33:42.031
MARISHA: Yeah, you do, considering you and your men

03:33:42.031 --> 03:33:44.781
have surrounded our campsite in the middle of the night

03:33:44.781 --> 03:33:46.941
after trekking through the long dark night.

03:33:46.941 --> 03:33:50.461
To me, that feels like someone who's pretty upset.

03:33:50.461 --> 03:33:53.271
MATT: You see a vein bulge in the
side of the head for a second,

03:33:53.271 --> 03:33:55.487
and one of the hands closes before he takes a breath.

03:33:55.487 --> 03:33:57.071
(inhales heavily)

03:33:57.071 --> 03:33:58.881
MARISHA: Yeah, see that?
MATT: "Well."

03:33:58.881 --> 03:34:01.442
MARISHA: That vein, yeah.

03:34:02.401 --> 03:34:04.804
MATT: "So my question would be,

03:34:05.808 --> 03:34:07.815
"what purpose did you have in acquiring this?

03:34:07.815 --> 03:34:09.162
"Did you acquire it for us?"

03:34:11.221 --> 03:34:12.741
MARISHA: Maybe we did.

03:34:12.741 --> 03:34:15.691
MATT: "Well, then that would be a
gracious blessing upon us all,

03:34:15.691 --> 03:34:18.571
"doing us a great favor,

03:34:18.571 --> 03:34:21.951
"and for that, we would be very thankful."

03:34:21.951 --> 03:34:24.191
MARISHA: We were kind of hoping it would be a surprise

03:34:24.191 --> 03:34:26.384
when we met you at Aeor,

03:34:27.751 --> 03:34:30.268
but I guess we could talk about it now.

03:34:32.801 --> 03:34:35.751
ASHLEY: Or you could let us sleep for two hours,

03:34:35.751 --> 03:34:40.034
and then we could give it.
(laughter)

03:34:42.341 --> 03:34:43.174
It's fine.

03:34:45.061 --> 03:34:47.684
MATT: "Let's have a conversation, and when that's done,

03:34:48.571 --> 03:34:51.561
"you're welcome to continue sleeping, having your breakfast.

03:34:51.561 --> 03:34:53.511
"You can go about your merry way.

03:34:53.511 --> 03:34:56.904
"Or if the hooks are in you,

03:34:58.171 --> 03:35:00.288
"there are more answers where you walk.

03:35:03.711 --> 03:35:07.899
"But nevertheless, you took something.

03:35:09.791 --> 03:35:11.291
"Where would it be?"

03:35:13.371 --> 03:35:15.254
MARISHA: (chuckles)
SAM: (exhales)

03:35:16.212 --> 03:35:17.645
I-- What makes you think

03:35:17.645 --> 03:35:21.381
that we're going to disclose that information?

03:35:21.381 --> 03:35:23.521
MATT: "Well, you said you got it possibly as a favor for us.

03:35:23.521 --> 03:35:24.841
"I think this is a fantastic chance

03:35:24.841 --> 03:35:28.001
"to show that you are indeed a friend.

03:35:28.001 --> 03:35:31.301
"Someone whose been wanting to learn,

03:35:31.301 --> 03:35:33.091
"someone whose been wanting to see

03:35:34.161 --> 03:35:37.296
"what most eyes are not capable of seeing."

03:35:38.871 --> 03:35:40.538
MARISHA: Oh, Lucien, we've seen a lot.

03:35:41.471 --> 03:35:43.979
I wouldn't underestimate how much we've seen.

03:35:45.231 --> 03:35:46.651
MATT: "I can guarantee there're some things

03:35:46.651 --> 03:35:48.981
you've never seen, dear."

03:35:48.981 --> 03:35:50.221
He says, and as he says that,

03:35:50.221 --> 03:35:53.274
all the other voices finish the sentence with him.

03:35:54.121 --> 03:35:56.611
LIAM: Just got to stall him another hour and 55 minutes.

03:35:56.611 --> 03:35:59.071
(laughter)

03:35:59.071 --> 03:35:59.904
TRAVIS: Plus it feels like--

03:35:59.904 --> 03:36:01.474
LAURA: This snow blanket is so comfy.

03:36:01.474 --> 03:36:03.541
TRAVIS: There's so much room to cover.

03:36:03.541 --> 03:36:04.601
I mean, aren't there,

03:36:04.601 --> 03:36:08.721
what five, six of these excavation sites?

03:36:08.721 --> 03:36:11.821
Have you visited everything and gotten everything you need?

03:36:12.907 --> 03:36:15.014
MATT: "We're on the cusp.

03:36:16.081 --> 03:36:17.287
"A brief journey.

03:36:19.301 --> 03:36:20.701
"And I think it's quite fortuitous

03:36:20.701 --> 03:36:22.991
"that our paths have converged in this way,

03:36:22.991 --> 03:36:27.991
"as you've helped us now on two occasions."

03:36:28.661 --> 03:36:30.941
TRAVIS: We just figured you were going east.

03:36:30.941 --> 03:36:34.871
We heard of locations that were further northeast

03:36:34.871 --> 03:36:39.009
from that site where we first met you,

03:36:39.009 --> 03:36:40.291
and we just figured we'd converge

03:36:40.291 --> 03:36:41.471
in the middle at some point.

03:36:41.471 --> 03:36:42.941
Have you collected everything that you need

03:36:42.941 --> 03:36:44.961
from those locations?

03:36:44.961 --> 03:36:47.961
MATT: "So far, at least the things
that we need from the outside.

03:36:47.961 --> 03:36:50.537
"Everything else lies within the actual ruin itself."

03:36:50.537 --> 03:36:52.696
MARISHA: Did you not continue your...

03:36:54.161 --> 03:36:54.994
Nope, never mind.

03:36:54.994 --> 03:36:58.429
Taking back what I said, nope. (chuckles)

03:36:58.429 --> 03:36:59.343
TRAVIS: Did you say that out loud?

03:36:59.343 --> 03:37:03.348
MARISHA: Nope, that was Marisha saying. Beau did not speak.

03:37:03.348 --> 03:37:06.421
(laughter)

03:37:06.421 --> 03:37:07.787
LIAM: Smooth criminal.

03:37:07.787 --> 03:37:09.461
ASHLEY: What's weird is though,

03:37:09.461 --> 03:37:12.327
I--I--I don't understand, um,

03:37:13.352 --> 03:37:16.610
why we need to give this to you.

03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:18.370
LIAM: (quietly) No, just two more hours.

03:37:18.370 --> 03:37:20.070
ASHLEY: You know-- (chuckles)

03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:21.101
Two more, two more hours.

03:37:21.101 --> 03:37:22.676
MARISHA: I know I am, but what are you?

03:37:22.676 --> 03:37:24.261
LAURA: (chuckles)

03:37:24.261 --> 03:37:28.631
ASHLEY: You know, because it seems
like finders keepers out here

03:37:28.631 --> 03:37:30.186
in Eiselcross.

03:37:32.551 --> 03:37:33.384
No?

03:37:34.261 --> 03:37:36.291
MATT: "Perhaps.

03:37:36.291 --> 03:37:38.741
"You're right, you found that,

03:37:38.741 --> 03:37:41.422
"and now we found you.

03:37:42.321 --> 03:37:46.841
"So the law would say under these conditions,

03:37:46.841 --> 03:37:50.054
"that perhaps you're ours for the taking.

03:37:51.001 --> 03:37:52.881
"Wouldn't that be right?"

03:37:52.881 --> 03:37:56.801
MARISHA: Yeah, you could pick a fight
if you really wanted to, but--

03:37:56.801 --> 03:37:58.231
MATT: "I'm not here to pick a fight.

03:37:58.231 --> 03:38:00.571
"I'm here to ask--
MARISHA: Really?

03:38:00.571 --> 03:38:05.144
MATT: "-- for something that I was after.

03:38:06.321 --> 03:38:09.451
"And I'm giving you the opportunity

03:38:11.921 --> 03:38:15.614
"to be a friend and help us."

03:38:18.521 --> 03:38:21.076
SAM: It's true that we haven't...

03:38:22.001 --> 03:38:23.741
You haven't shown any aggression to us

03:38:23.741 --> 03:38:26.291
and we haven't shown any aggression to you so far.

03:38:26.291 --> 03:38:29.074
So it's probably best if we keep it that way.

03:38:29.941 --> 03:38:32.581
You have concealed some things from us.

03:38:32.581 --> 03:38:34.941
We asked you lots of questions last time we met,

03:38:34.941 --> 03:38:37.111
and some were not answered.

03:38:37.111 --> 03:38:38.481
MATT: "Well, you hadn't yet proven

03:38:38.481 --> 03:38:41.631
"that you were on the up and up.

03:38:41.631 --> 03:38:43.411
"As you can imagine, there are a lot of people here

03:38:43.411 --> 03:38:45.211
"who would be curious about what we're doing,

03:38:45.211 --> 03:38:48.721
"and would be eager to put a knife in our back.

03:38:48.721 --> 03:38:52.421
"So I assumed if you were indeed curious,

03:38:52.421 --> 03:38:56.262
"if you were wanting to learn more about...

03:38:57.946 --> 03:38:59.971
"the Eyes of Nine,

03:38:59.971 --> 03:39:03.011
"then you'd follow.

03:39:03.011 --> 03:39:04.771
"I was surprised that you

03:39:06.551 --> 03:39:08.571
"seem to have a bit more gumption and get up and go

03:39:08.571 --> 03:39:10.601
"than we were expecting."

03:39:10.601 --> 03:39:13.394
TALIESIN: Well, I feel like we wanted some insurance.

03:39:17.281 --> 03:39:18.821
SAM: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

03:39:18.821 --> 03:39:21.488
I mean, we are curious, you're right,

03:39:21.488 --> 03:39:24.591
but we're also-- we have some experience,

03:39:24.591 --> 03:39:25.911
and we know that curiosity

03:39:25.911 --> 03:39:28.701
doesn't really get you anywhere on its own,

03:39:28.701 --> 03:39:33.701
so now we are curious and we have a little bit of leverage,

03:39:33.711 --> 03:39:37.241
and so I think we're okay with a conversation,

03:39:37.241 --> 03:39:39.761
as long as some information is shared on your end,

03:39:39.761 --> 03:39:43.801
we'll share some on our end and we'll see where we get.

03:39:43.801 --> 03:39:48.191
MATT: He pulls this black, jet black metal scimitar

03:39:48.191 --> 03:39:49.431
out of the sheath in the side

03:39:49.431 --> 03:39:51.451
and plants it in the snow in front,

03:39:51.451 --> 03:39:55.371
and leans on it, arms crossed, hands in front of the chin,

03:39:55.371 --> 03:39:58.979
resting on the tip looking forward towards you, goes,

03:40:00.021 --> 03:40:03.304
"Leverage, well that makes this a negotiation.

03:40:04.711 --> 03:40:08.071
"You know what I want, what we want.

03:40:08.071 --> 03:40:09.209
"What do you want?"

03:40:11.791 --> 03:40:14.581
TRAVIS: I would say, what your ultimate plans are.

03:40:14.581 --> 03:40:17.441
I mean, after all, if we're to be at the table and to play,

03:40:17.441 --> 03:40:20.321
we have to at least have a card and now we do.

03:40:20.321 --> 03:40:23.111
So you said that if the hooks are in,

03:40:23.111 --> 03:40:26.787
we can continue and see what this is all about.

03:40:26.787 --> 03:40:29.201
Would that mean our next stop is Aeor?

03:40:31.081 --> 03:40:32.721
MATT: "That it would be."

03:40:32.721 --> 03:40:34.671
TRAVIS: Well, I for one am very curious

03:40:34.671 --> 03:40:36.541
as to where this is leading to,

03:40:36.541 --> 03:40:39.161
and frankly what it's all about.

03:40:39.161 --> 03:40:41.011
I wouldn't mind traveling a bit further

03:40:41.011 --> 03:40:43.351
knowing that you've hit all the rest of your stops,

03:40:43.351 --> 03:40:45.810
we can't seem to be of any further service to you

03:40:45.810 --> 03:40:47.681
in expediting your cause,

03:40:47.681 --> 03:40:51.551
and well, I think we'll all be safer traveling in numbers,

03:40:51.551 --> 03:40:52.471
don't you think?

03:40:52.471 --> 03:40:54.271
Although this poor chap, I think he's had enough,

03:40:54.271 --> 03:40:55.304
yes, Avar?

03:40:55.304 --> 03:40:56.184
Iver?

03:40:56.184 --> 03:40:57.361
MATT: (laughs)

03:40:57.361 --> 03:40:59.621
He's still half-buried in the snow

03:40:59.621 --> 03:41:03.271
trying to not be seen, and is like-- "(shushing)"

03:41:03.271 --> 03:41:07.794
"Hi," and just disappears even
further under one of his coats.

03:41:10.231 --> 03:41:12.794
You glance around and you cannot see Dagen.

03:41:14.931 --> 03:41:15.856
TRAVIS: Interesting.

03:41:15.856 --> 03:41:16.689
MARISHA: Good, that's good.
SAM: Let's not mention him.

03:41:16.689 --> 03:41:19.281
MARISHA: That's fine, yeah exactly, good.

03:41:19.281 --> 03:41:21.451
TALIESIN: I mean, I can't speak for the others,

03:41:21.451 --> 03:41:24.461
they have baggage, but I...

03:41:25.731 --> 03:41:27.131
MARISHA: Hey.

03:41:27.131 --> 03:41:28.581
TALIESIN: You do.

03:41:28.581 --> 03:41:29.871
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Fair.

03:41:29.871 --> 03:41:31.565
MARISHA: Fair.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:41:32.611 --> 03:41:35.541
I just feel a little safer

03:41:35.541 --> 03:41:37.444
just having something going forward.

03:41:38.491 --> 03:41:42.591
I mean, I appreciate what you've been trying to do,

03:41:42.591 --> 03:41:43.464
I've just been...

03:41:44.311 --> 03:41:49.051
I feel like I've had probably more polite people

03:41:49.051 --> 03:41:53.574
betray my trust in my time outside of my home, so.

03:41:55.240 --> 03:41:56.761
MATT: "Have I betrayed your trust at all?"

03:41:56.761 --> 03:41:59.301
TALIESIN: Not yet, obviously you've been--

03:41:59.301 --> 03:42:00.321
MATT: "But you're the kind of person

03:42:00.321 --> 03:42:02.021
"that waits for someone to betray their trust

03:42:02.021 --> 03:42:03.661
"all the day is long?"

03:42:03.661 --> 03:42:06.011
TALIESIN: I'm learning to expect--
MATT: "That's a sad way to live."

03:42:06.011 --> 03:42:10.274
TALIESIN: Well, I'm learning to
expect a lot of things out here,

03:42:11.411 --> 03:42:14.224
and it is, it's unfortunate, but I figure,

03:42:15.891 --> 03:42:19.011
it's going to be a lot harder getting what you want

03:42:19.011 --> 03:42:21.341
if you have to figure out how to get it

03:42:21.341 --> 03:42:24.231
once we're all gone,

03:42:24.231 --> 03:42:27.591
and honestly you seem pretty convincing,

03:42:27.591 --> 03:42:29.151
so I really don't imagine that

03:42:30.291 --> 03:42:31.921
once we've had a couple conversations,

03:42:31.921 --> 03:42:34.611
that you're not going to get it in the first place.

03:42:34.611 --> 03:42:35.444
MATT: "Well."

03:42:36.291 --> 03:42:38.231
TALIESIN: So why wait, why not wait?

03:42:38.231 --> 03:42:43.051
MATT: "The thing that you have
is not the only one of its kind.

03:42:43.051 --> 03:42:45.311
"It would be far more convenient for us to have it now,

03:42:45.311 --> 03:42:49.886
"but should you not wish to, we can find another."

03:42:51.271 --> 03:42:53.791
TALIESIN: So let's eat and let's talk about it.

03:42:53.791 --> 03:42:54.624
MATT: "Indeed.

03:42:56.191 --> 03:42:59.794
"So what is the trade then?

03:43:00.961 --> 03:43:04.126
"You will give us the stone,

03:43:07.411 --> 03:43:10.734
"and we tell you what it is we're after."

03:43:11.651 --> 03:43:12.937
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so.
LAURA: No.

03:43:12.937 --> 03:43:15.911
TRAVIS: I don't think that has the
right weight to it, does it?

03:43:15.911 --> 03:43:18.401
I think it's more like we come with you,

03:43:18.401 --> 03:43:23.004
and you inform us, as much as you're comfortable,

03:43:24.241 --> 03:43:25.371
a little bit about what you're after

03:43:25.371 --> 03:43:27.211
and what you expect to happen.

03:43:27.211 --> 03:43:31.171
See, the thing about having one piece of a puzzle is yes,

03:43:31.171 --> 03:43:32.254
you could go find another,

03:43:32.254 --> 03:43:34.441
but it just might not fit right.

03:43:34.441 --> 03:43:37.051
So you really <i>do</i> need our piece of the puzzle.

03:43:37.051 --> 03:43:38.393
And I sure would like to know

03:43:38.393 --> 03:43:41.541
what the whole picture looks like, or at least get a hint.

03:43:41.541 --> 03:43:42.561
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:43:42.561 --> 03:43:43.601
MARISHA: Damn, that's good.

03:43:43.601 --> 03:43:45.331
Damn, that's so good.

03:43:45.331 --> 03:43:47.974
TRAVIS: Oh, natural 19 for a 24!

03:43:49.401 --> 03:43:50.731
SAM: Wild magic, butterflies.

03:43:50.731 --> 03:43:52.181
MATT: Lucien leans back and goes.

03:43:53.056 --> 03:43:54.364
(laughter)

03:43:54.364 --> 03:43:55.522
TRAVIS: Pah!

03:43:59.921 --> 03:44:02.001
And as he looks towards Fjord,

03:44:02.001 --> 03:44:03.541
Caduceus, you swear,

03:44:03.541 --> 03:44:06.511
you swear that the eye tattoo on the side of the neck

03:44:06.511 --> 03:44:09.774
seems to turn and look your direction.

03:44:09.774 --> 03:44:11.332
SAM: Gross.
MATT: "He just goes,

03:44:17.881 --> 03:44:19.404
"Well, boys and girls,

03:44:20.611 --> 03:44:23.111
"it has been a bit lonely traveling out here alone.

03:44:25.051 --> 03:44:27.251
"Are we against having a few more companions?"

03:44:29.331 --> 03:44:30.986
(as Zoran) "Not particularly.

03:44:31.909 --> 03:44:35.001
"Wouldn't be too bad to have some more knuckleheads

03:44:35.001 --> 03:44:37.638
"to toss some laughs with, eh?"

03:44:39.128 --> 03:44:40.834
The halfling looks up and goes,

03:44:42.428 --> 03:44:44.571
"Yeah, yeah sure, more friends.

03:44:44.571 --> 03:44:46.021
"We can take more friends, eh?"

03:44:47.291 --> 03:44:51.591
The elf looks back, initially curious to the group, goes,

03:44:51.591 --> 03:44:52.424
"Well...

03:44:55.049 --> 03:44:57.021
"sure, why not?

03:44:57.021 --> 03:44:58.271
"Could be fun."

03:44:59.221 --> 03:45:01.521
And Cree is leaning behind Lucien,

03:45:01.521 --> 03:45:02.511
just looking at all of you

03:45:02.511 --> 03:45:04.561
with this very stoic expression and goes,

03:45:07.107 --> 03:45:09.828
"Whatever the Nonagon says, goes."

03:45:12.331 --> 03:45:13.879
Lucien goes-- (hands clap)

03:45:13.879 --> 03:45:14.895
"Very well.

03:45:18.253 --> 03:45:19.436
"Is that one coming?"

03:45:19.436 --> 03:45:22.201
Points over to your new gnome friend, Iver,

03:45:22.201 --> 03:45:24.801
who's now not visible beneath the snow.

03:45:24.801 --> 03:45:26.471
Iver's like, "No, no, no,

03:45:26.471 --> 03:45:29.944
I'm going back to Balenpost." (laughs nervously)

03:45:32.391 --> 03:45:33.224
TALIESIN: Works for us.

03:45:33.224 --> 03:45:34.959
LAURA: I don't have my spells still, if I'm not...

03:45:34.959 --> 03:45:36.741
If we haven't gotten a rest, I can't do it.

03:45:36.741 --> 03:45:37.574
MARISHA: Fuck.

03:45:39.551 --> 03:45:41.391
TRAVIS: It's kind of the least of our worries at the moment.

03:45:41.391 --> 03:45:42.224
SAM: Yeah, that's true.

03:45:42.224 --> 03:45:45.742
ASHLEY: We could give him the stone for two hours of sleep.

03:45:47.068 --> 03:45:48.441
(chuckling)

03:45:48.441 --> 03:45:50.301
SAM: Let us sleep for an hour and 55 minutes

03:45:50.301 --> 03:45:51.774
and we'll give you everything you want.

03:45:51.774 --> 03:45:54.435
(laughter)

03:45:54.435 --> 03:45:55.585
TRAVIS: What a negotiation!
MARISHA: I mean.

03:45:55.585 --> 03:45:56.418
TRAVIS: There are times in my life

03:45:56.418 --> 03:45:58.069
where I would been like--
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been there.

03:45:58.069 --> 03:46:00.110
(laughter)

03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:03.952
TALIESIN: Take it, take it.
ASHLEY: Take anything, let me sleep.

03:46:03.952 --> 03:46:04.951
LIAM: I mean we're not sleeping,

03:46:04.951 --> 03:46:07.231
we're holding still and listening to all this shit.

03:46:07.231 --> 03:46:10.571
LAURA: I'm trying so hard to keep my eyes closed.

03:46:10.571 --> 03:46:12.474
SAM: I guess we can let Iver go.

03:46:14.451 --> 03:46:17.041
Is Iver-- are you going to be okay

03:46:17.041 --> 03:46:19.641
crossing the tundra by yourself?

03:46:19.641 --> 03:46:22.031
TALIESIN: Only for an hour.
SAM: No provisions?

03:46:22.031 --> 03:46:24.781
MATT: "I can travel faster just by myself,

03:46:24.781 --> 03:46:27.684
"and I've done this as a job for quite some time,

03:46:27.684 --> 03:46:28.829
"so I'll be fine."

03:46:28.829 --> 03:46:30.129
TALIESIN: We're only an hour away.

03:46:31.531 --> 03:46:32.922
SAM: Just remember,

03:46:35.455 --> 03:46:37.071
we're good guys,

03:46:38.021 --> 03:46:39.974
these guys are not--

03:46:41.291 --> 03:46:42.851
We protected you from them.

03:46:42.851 --> 03:46:43.971
TRAVIS: TBD.

03:46:43.971 --> 03:46:45.841
TALIESIN: Yeah, just let it--
SAM: Well--

03:46:45.841 --> 03:46:47.050
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:46:47.050 --> 03:46:48.058
(laughter)

03:46:48.058 --> 03:46:49.396
TRAVIS: Goddamn it!

03:46:50.401 --> 03:46:51.651
LAURA: One.

03:46:51.651 --> 03:46:52.853
SAM: Oh, eight!

03:46:52.853 --> 03:46:54.155
(laughter)

03:46:54.155 --> 03:46:56.388
MARISHA: Oh, lord.
TRAVIS: Where is Shorthalt?

03:46:56.388 --> 03:46:59.497
(laughter)

03:46:59.497 --> 03:47:02.366
LIAM: Is that a hand cone of clarity?
MATT: Iver's going--

03:47:02.366 --> 03:47:04.321
(laughter)

03:47:04.321 --> 03:47:05.361
SAM: Okay.
MATT: He's already leaving.

03:47:05.361 --> 03:47:06.881
He's like pack on his shoulder, like,

03:47:06.881 --> 03:47:09.781
"Oh, okay all right, I'll-- travel safe."

03:47:09.781 --> 03:47:12.051
MARISHA: Iver.
MATT: "Yeah?"

03:47:12.051 --> 03:47:13.761
MARISHA: This one sees all.

03:47:16.381 --> 03:47:18.416
TRAVIS: I make my face look like his.

03:47:18.416 --> 03:47:19.499
I wink.
SAM: Ooh.

03:47:20.500 --> 03:47:21.500
Change back.

03:47:22.571 --> 03:47:24.421
MARISHA: So then you know.
MATT: And he just turns around

03:47:24.421 --> 03:47:27.271
and starts trudging in the snow in a southward direction.

03:47:28.781 --> 03:47:30.331
MATT: You see Lucien's watching

03:47:30.331 --> 03:47:31.313
and goes--
MARISHA: Sorry.

03:47:31.313 --> 03:47:32.871
That's what I know best.

03:47:32.871 --> 03:47:36.455
MATT: Lucien raises a finger over
towards the halfling, goes,

03:47:38.429 --> 03:47:40.841
"Do, um... do you need--"

03:47:42.351 --> 03:47:43.534
TALIESIN: No, he's fine.

03:47:44.731 --> 03:47:45.714
MATT: "Very well."

03:47:47.989 --> 03:47:49.205
(exhales)

03:47:51.006 --> 03:47:52.331
"Well then,

03:47:53.311 --> 03:47:56.264
"y'all look a bit tired and I think
we can use a bit of rest.

03:47:57.111 --> 03:47:58.401
"Finish up, have some breakfast,

03:47:58.401 --> 03:48:00.797
"then I guess we'll be on our way together."

03:48:02.371 --> 03:48:04.161
TALIESIN: That sounds nice, actually.

03:48:04.161 --> 03:48:06.591
TRAVIS: Bit more sleep, some food.

03:48:06.591 --> 03:48:08.224
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yep, yeah-- (mumbles)

03:48:10.991 --> 03:48:13.201
MATT: "I think we've got quite a bit to talk about

03:48:13.201 --> 03:48:14.404
"on the road ahead."

03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:18.261
(smacks lips)

03:48:18.261 --> 03:48:19.359
And that's where we'll end tonight.

03:48:19.359 --> 03:48:20.441
(groaning)

03:48:20.441 --> 03:48:22.344
MARISHA: Oh no!
TRAVIS: How'd he find us?!

03:48:22.344 --> 03:48:23.355
ASHLEY: No!

03:48:23.355 --> 03:48:24.600
TRAVIS: How did he find us?!

03:48:24.600 --> 03:48:26.109
MARISHA: (groaning)

03:48:26.109 --> 03:48:28.473
TRAVIS: I guess if he's seen us, he
can scry on any of us, right?

03:48:28.473 --> 03:48:29.306
LAURA: Locate Creature.
SAM: It's because

03:48:29.306 --> 03:48:31.041
we slept near the thing!

03:48:31.041 --> 03:48:33.431
TALIESIN: Oh my god, we're going
to get two more hours sleep.

03:48:33.431 --> 03:48:34.781
Do you know what that means?

03:48:34.781 --> 03:48:36.920
It means brunch with the devil. I'm so excited.

03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:38.325
(laughter)

03:48:38.325 --> 03:48:42.861
MATT: There's a lot of things someone can do

03:48:43.811 --> 03:48:45.670
with a fraction of your blood.

03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:49.053
(groaning)
TRAVIS: Oh, that fucking cat.

03:48:49.053 --> 03:48:50.286
LAURA: Has our blood.

03:48:50.286 --> 03:48:51.875
TRAVIS: <i>El gato es diablo,</i> I told you.

03:48:51.875 --> 03:48:54.549
SAM: That blood was so long ago!

03:48:54.549 --> 03:48:58.371
TALIESIN: It's gone bad by now, right? Right?

03:48:58.371 --> 03:48:59.837
You got to refrigerate that-- oh, it's cold.

03:48:59.837 --> 03:49:01.486
ASHLEY: Well, we're cold out here.
TRAVIS: Vials of blood.

03:49:01.486 --> 03:49:02.502
Son of a bitch.

03:49:02.502 --> 03:49:04.261
MATT: Well, it's a blood cleric.
They got all sorts of tricks,

03:49:04.261 --> 03:49:06.331
even beyond what the player--

03:49:06.331 --> 03:49:08.406
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, figure out the slice.

03:49:08.406 --> 03:49:09.704
MATT: Yeah, I know, I know.

03:49:09.704 --> 03:49:10.679
ASHLEY: Damn.

03:49:10.679 --> 03:49:13.935
MATT: All right, we'll pick up from there next week.

03:49:13.935 --> 03:49:15.657
LAURA: Oh, next year!

03:49:15.657 --> 03:49:18.357
MATT: Next year. That's right! Yeah, yeah.

03:49:18.357 --> 03:49:20.332
Oh my god. Aaah!

03:49:20.332 --> 03:49:21.759
Next year in 2021.

03:49:21.759 --> 03:49:23.251
TRAVIS: May it be a better one.

03:49:23.251 --> 03:49:24.984
MATT: May it indeed be a fucking better one.

03:49:24.984 --> 03:49:26.534
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:49:26.534 --> 03:49:28.131
MATT: Oh man, that went weird places.

03:49:28.131 --> 03:49:32.541
Okay, let's see what traveling with the Nonagon

03:49:32.541 --> 03:49:35.041
is going to be like, oh man.

03:49:35.041 --> 03:49:37.257
TALIESIN: Maybe we'll get to do
a group combat against something.

03:49:37.257 --> 03:49:39.146
It'll be like a bonding exercise,

03:49:39.146 --> 03:49:40.494
like going on one of those weird--
TRAVIS: I've never quite gone up

03:49:40.494 --> 03:49:42.741
against another adventuring party.

03:49:42.741 --> 03:49:44.401
Like they're pretty stacked.

03:49:44.401 --> 03:49:45.234
ALL: Yeah.

03:49:45.234 --> 03:49:47.181
TRAVIS: It's not like a foe or two.

03:49:47.181 --> 03:49:48.523
MARISHA: He's got weird tricks.
SAM: I feel like we could take out

03:49:48.523 --> 03:49:50.601
some of the side buddies, but--

03:49:50.601 --> 03:49:51.593
MARISHA: But Nonagon--

03:49:51.593 --> 03:49:53.001
LAURA: That guy is like legit.
SAM: Not him.

03:49:53.001 --> 03:49:54.426
Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:49:54.426 --> 03:49:55.573
LIAM: There are nein of us, though.

03:49:55.573 --> 03:49:57.155
TRAVIS: It's going to give and take if we do that.

03:49:57.155 --> 03:49:58.331
MARISHA: And we are mighty.

03:49:58.331 --> 03:49:59.961
MATT: Yeah, indeed.

03:49:59.961 --> 03:50:03.388
But we shall see what that looks like next year.

03:50:03.388 --> 03:50:04.221
(groaning)

03:50:04.221 --> 03:50:05.709
MATT: (laughs)

03:50:05.709 --> 03:50:07.544
ASHLEY: It's too far to wait.
MATT: I know.

03:50:07.544 --> 03:50:10.121
Thank you all so much for following along with us.

03:50:10.121 --> 03:50:14.211
Have very happy holidays all of you, and a happy new year.

03:50:14.211 --> 03:50:17.344
Of course, we'll see you in the new one.

03:50:18.271 --> 03:50:21.391
Enjoy, know that we love you very much, and...

03:50:21.391 --> 03:50:22.657
is it Thursday yet?

03:50:22.657 --> 03:50:23.562
Good night.

03:50:23.562 --> 03:50:26.510
(cheering)
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck 2020!

00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:03.506
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role where a bunch of us nerdy

00:00:03.506 --> 00:00:07.775
ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp;
Dragons. Before we dive into tonight's game, we

00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:12.335
got some announcements to get through. First and
foremost, we have two fantastic sponsors tonight.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:18.856
The first of which is our good friend D&amp;D Beyond!
They've been with us since we began this campaign.

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:25.374
The new book, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes,
releases tomorrow. I got one last month and it's

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:30.964
amazing. Oh my god, it's so good. It has the
Astral Dreadnought, I'm so happy. Hope you guys

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:38.100
never have to fight one. You can order that now on
D&amp;D Beyond and check out the wonderful content

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.174
there. If you order on D&amp;D Beyond, you also
receive the Rrakkma Adventurers League

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:50.455
gith-focused introductory adventure for free. If
you know what that means, we're of like mind. The

00:00:50.455 --> 00:00:53.995
githyanki is such an amazing part of D&amp;D lore.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:55.303
LIAM: Go Yankees!

00:00:55.303 --> 00:01:03.468
MATT: Go Razi! Anyway, as a reminder, Tome of Foes
is also available in D&amp;D Beyond's legendary

00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:09.841
bundle, which is still 25% off using the code
826LA. If you want it to do the legendary bundle,

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:15.809
get the huge discount, Tome of Foes is included in
that, so go and check it out. It's amazing. Thank

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:21.755
you, D&amp;D Beyond, and hope you enjoy the new
release tomorrow. Sam? You want to talk about our

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:23.089
other sponsor for the evening?

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:26.708
SAM: Yes, our second sponsor for the evening is
Backblaze!

00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:29.132
(cheering)

00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:36.886
SAM: If you don't know Backblaze-- I'm sorry. If
you guys don't know Backblaze, it is unlimited

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:44.868
cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $5 a month.
Yes, Backblaze stores docs, music, photos, videos,

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:51.602
fanart, and more. I use the service, and to be
honest, I always thought, "It sounds magical."

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:57.892
Well guys, I've discovered that it is actual
magic. Faery magic to be exact; In fact, I

00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:03.879
captured one of their head faeries, Yev, a little
sprite named Yev, in this trash bag.

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:06.821
TRAVIS: Look at him flittering around!

00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:09.574
SAM: Flits around a lot. He's just settling down
in here.

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:11.424
MARISHA: There is no air hole; that's so
irresponsible.

00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:22.757
SAM: It's okay! Oh look! Magic is real! I have it
right here in the bag! Yev, how does Backblaze work?

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.019
TOY IN BAG: (bird tweeting)

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:32.138
SAM: Oh! He says you can restore files anywhere
via direct download.

00:02:32.138 --> 00:02:33.748
LAURA: Did you think that was going to be loud
enough?

00:02:33.748 --> 00:02:42.770
SAM: Shh. I've got a backup if it doesn't work. He
says you can restore files anywhere via direct

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.091
download, or restore by mail and receive a hard
drive with your files. Yes, Yev, but how does

00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:51.094
Backblaze keeps all those backups for such a low
price?

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:54.271
TOY IN BAG: (garbled speech imitation)

00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.247
(laughter)

00:02:56.247 --> 00:03:02.648
SAM: Wait! Yev says that they harness the power of
love to store data and that love also sustains

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:09.324
your life? Wait a second, without your love,
you'll die?! Oh my god!

00:03:09.324 --> 00:03:11.073
TOY IN BAG: (squealing)

00:03:11.073 --> 00:03:12.942
SAM: Oh god, everyone! Yev is sick!

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:13.854
LAURA: No!

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:21.369
SAM: Maybe the power of our applause will cure
him. Everyone clap. Oh my god no, it's made it

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:28.374
worse! His lung has collapsed. He's bleeding
internally. Oh my god, what can we do?! He says

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:34.095
that not enough people have visited
backblaze.com/criticalrole.

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.550
TRAVIS: You're shaking it!

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.570
SAM: That's him shaking, it's not me. My puppetry
work is amazing.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.995
TOY IN BAG: (squealing)

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:48.540
SAM: Not enough people have visited
backblaze.com/criticalrole to sign up to get a

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.807
15-day free trial. Critters! If you want Yev to
live, you need to click on the site right now! Oh

00:03:56.807 --> 00:04:01.573
god! Oh god, he's flatlining. He's dead.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:02.709
LAURA: No!

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.269
SAM: Yev is dead! The Backblaze faery is dead.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.930
TOY IN BAG: (squealing)

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.539
SAM: Oh! What?! It's a miracle!

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:14.191
LAURA: Don't clap!

00:04:14.263 --> 00:04:21.034
SAM: Enough critters visited
backblaze.com/criticalrole and signed up. You

00:04:21.034 --> 00:04:24.978
saved his life! We can continue the show.

00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:28.399
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:33.718
MATT: You are a master at building tension.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.732
SAM: Puppetry. That was a real faery, guys.

00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:42.538
LIAM: The Jim Henson studio was mad to let you
go.

00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:46.724
TRAVIS: How you ever snagged it with just a
kitchen garbage bag is beyond me.

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:48.896
MATT: He's thrifty.

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.203
SAM: A child's lightsaber toy thing.

00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:54.763
MATT: Don't ruin the illusion!

00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:55.912
ASHLEY: What are you doing?

00:04:55.912 --> 00:04:57.367
MARISHA: Why do you show your tricks?

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:58.652
ASHLEY: Yes, stop it!

00:04:58.652 --> 00:04:59.816
LAURA: That's so quiet.

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:01.315
SAM: I know, it's too quiet.

00:05:01.315 --> 00:05:04.660
MATT: The faery escaped and left us presents.

00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:13.923
SAM: It's a dragon. Oh no, it ran out of
batteries! Everyone clap! Yeah, it's alive!

00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:16.257
TALIESIN: My face hurts.

00:05:17.038 --> 00:05:32.242
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Backblaze,
for your amazing support. Getting us on track

00:05:32.242 --> 00:05:46.213
here, we have the Vox Machina: Origins hardcover
that will be on sale next week on 5/31. Very soon,

00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:53.937
LAURA: It's beautiful!

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.087
MATT: It's pretty awesome, we're excited.

00:05:56.087 --> 00:05:58.614
LIAM: It's gorgeous on paper.

00:05:58.614 --> 00:06:03.443

00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:41.955
LAURA: Somebody wasn't asked.

00:06:41.955 --> 00:06:43.049
SAM: Is that true?

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:44.332
LAURA: This girl right here.

00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:46.043
TRAVIS: No, we asked, you just don't pay attention
to email.

00:06:46.043 --> 00:06:49.153
(laughter)

00:06:49.153 --> 00:06:51.066
LAURA: Oops.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.744
MATT: It's okay, you've got stuff going on.

00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:55.719
LAURA: You know, there are other things happening.

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:58.459
ASHLEY: Human growing in.

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:04.698
LAURA: I totally was like, "Nobody asked me." All
the oops. Sorry guys!

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:14.723
MATT: We'll see you guys there. Some of you. We
have our fantastic Talks Machina every Tuesday at

00:07:14.723 --> 00:07:20.334
7:00pm Pacific. Our fantastic host and maestro of
cabbages, Brian W. Foster, will be there with a

00:07:20.334 --> 00:07:24.065
few guests from the show to discuss the events of
tonight's episode. It will be available on Twitch

00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:30.827
and Project Alpha so go check it out there. Also,
a reminder for Twitch Prime: If you have an Amazon

00:07:30.827 --> 00:07:35.617
Prime account, you can sign up to subscribe to a

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:47.696
Critical Role Live dice sets are currently back in
stock and in the store.

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:52.030
LAURA: Yes, and if they're still there, the Vox
Machina dice set is around as well.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.332
MATT: Oh shit.

00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:58.850
LAURA: I know! I tweeted it out because I was
like, "No one told me that one was in"! That's exciting.

00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:05.340
MATT: To finish up, I will be flying bright and
early tomorrow up to Calgary to be part of

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:16.116
Otafest. All you wonderful folks in the Canadian
area, come and say hi, visit our panels, signings,

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:24.042
and all that good stuff in between. I'll see you
guys there. Unless we have anything else to

00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:28.981
discuss, I believe that it's the end of the
announcements for tonight. That also heralds our

00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:34.318
diving back into tonight's episode of Critical
Role.

00:08:36.492 --> 00:08:38.411
[click, TV static]

00:08:40.443 --> 00:09:04.425
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:09:58.314 --> 00:10:02.740
MATT: Hello and welcome back! Wow, you're going
back to basics tonight.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.180
LIAM: We've got to.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:13.489
MATT: Apparently, going back full circle. Back at
255 and zero. Last we left off: The Mighty Nein

00:10:13.489 --> 00:10:22.573
have been caught up in the political turmoil of
the Empire, noticing that the king has declared

00:10:22.573 --> 00:10:31.224
war on the eastern realm of Xhorhas, specifically
the Kryn dynasty. There was an assault on one of

00:10:31.224 --> 00:10:37.061
the garrisons in the east. There were many lives
lost and the sky now darkens. You've begun to

00:10:37.061 --> 00:10:43.515
decide what it is you can do and what your current
plan of action is. As you began to gather your

00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:49.172
things as you decide where your next trajectory
would be, you were summoned to the King's Hall,

00:10:49.172 --> 00:10:54.723
and brought before the Lawmaster of the town of
Zadash. She implored you if you're interested,

00:10:54.723 --> 00:10:59.829
having proven your mettle in the past and in the
Victory Pit not too long ago, if you'd be

00:10:59.829 --> 00:11:05.122
interested as signing off as legionnaires to help
aid, protect, and do work for the Empire at home

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:09.556
while all the military forces of the Righteous
Brand had moved to the east to engage with the

00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:15.730
enemy. You took it under consideration and left,
went back to gather some more supplies at your

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:21.669
inn. You were delivered a missive from an old
friend, Kara, saying the The Gentleman would like

00:11:21.669 --> 00:11:27.851
to speak with you. That was where we left off.
Mighty Nein, having just returned to the Leaky

00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:32.602
Tap, being briefly met with Kara who delivered
this information and then vanished back into the

00:11:32.602 --> 00:11:35.430
afternoon, what would you like to do?

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.969
TRAVIS: Clearly, we're going to talk to El Jefe.

00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:42.517
(laughter)

00:11:42.517 --> 00:11:49.207
TRAVIS: Got it out of the way right away.
Autocorrect. Inside story. Inside joke. Whatever.

00:11:49.207 --> 00:11:53.940
SAM: The inside story.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.050
LAURA: Yes, I think we should go talk to him. That
seems like it would be smart, right?

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.193
MARISHA: Yeah, and we already signed one contract
with him.

00:12:02.193 --> 00:12:04.691
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's not like he wouldn't know where
we went if we left, anyway.

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.650
SAM: What time of day is it right now?

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.938
MATT: If I recall, it's later afternoon.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.774
SAM: That is my voice.

00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:12.935
LAURA: Is it?

00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:19.438
SAM: I'm dialing it in still. (vocalizes trying to
find Nott's voice)

00:12:19.952 --> 00:12:21.825
MATT: And we got there.

00:12:22.296 --> 00:12:24.675
TRAVIS: A little more mid, a little less treble.

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:26.596
SAM: What time is it?

00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:28.942
MATT: It's late afternoon, I believe.

00:12:28.942 --> 00:12:30.463
TRAVIS: We can head over.

00:12:30.463 --> 00:12:31.680
SAM: Let's do it.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.652
TALIESIN: I get nervous spending too much time in
one place, but if everyone's going, then we're going.

00:12:36.273 --> 00:12:38.601
TRAVIS: It's like a step in the way out.

00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:42.960
LAURA: What if what he wants us to do means that
we have to stay here for a while, though?

00:12:43.967 --> 00:12:46.101
TRAVIS: Then we'll have to make it worth our
while.

00:12:46.101 --> 00:12:50.723
LAURA: Like for a lot of money, would you stay?

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:54.248
TALIESIN: You're at a table, you're doing well.
Eventually, you're going to want to walk away from the table.

00:12:54.615 --> 00:12:58.632
LAURA: What if the table offers you four times the
amount you've ever seen?

00:12:59.632 --> 00:13:02.637
TALIESIN: The table always offers you four times
the amount you've ever seen. You got to walk away

00:13:02.637 --> 00:13:05.712
while you're winning. But all right!

00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:07.366
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll make a decision.

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:21.234
MATT: You make your way across the Pentamarket, to
the familiar down, dank, and broody interior of

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:27.430
the Evening Nip tavern. You pass by Clive, who
gives you a nod. You head towards the hidden

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:34.212
staircase down to the subterranean tavern. There a
different sound catches your ears. There's the

00:13:34.212 --> 00:13:42.798
familiar sound of warm music and tavern flair, but
you also hear rowdy shouts and cheers and the

00:13:42.798 --> 00:13:48.784
occasional sound of something heavy against a
skidding table. As you slowly descend toward the

00:13:48.784 --> 00:13:53.402
base of the curved staircase to enter the main
chamber, you can see some folks are sitting at the

00:13:53.402 --> 00:13:57.492
tables, The Gentleman is in his far corner at the
back, and they're all watching a small circle of

00:13:57.492 --> 00:14:03.255
people in the center as two individuals in the
process of beating the shit out of each other.

00:14:03.255 --> 00:14:09.212
Bare fists, bare knuckled. People are making bets,
laughing and cheering, and throwing beer and

00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:14.337
various objects into the ring to mess with them.
It is mid-craze scuffle at the moment.

00:14:14.337 --> 00:14:19.616
MARISHA: There's a fight club! You guys, it's a
fucking fight club!

00:14:19.616 --> 00:14:21.446
TRAVIS: Beau is in her element.

00:14:21.446 --> 00:14:26.359
MATT: As you guys step down into the main area,
the large ogre bodyguard stands and turns back.

00:14:26.359 --> 00:14:36.343
His low guttural grunt come through his protruding
jawline with a (grunt) and gives you a sign to continue inward.

00:14:36.823 --> 00:14:39.231
TRAVIS: How have you been, Kutha?

00:14:39.231 --> 00:14:41.357
MATT: "All right."

00:14:41.357 --> 00:14:43.718
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too, all right.

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:48.743
MATT: Getting a glimpse here as you watch a bit of
parting between shoulders as everyone's standing

00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:54.384
end to end. You hear this heavy crack and the two
people nearest to you bow backward. Apparently,

00:14:54.384 --> 00:14:58.579
one of the two fighting individuals being thrusted
into the circle is immediately pushed back into

00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:03.298
the center. You hear another couple of swings go
before they both breakaway. You can hear the heavy

00:15:03.298 --> 00:15:10.059
breaths of them now exhausted, pouring with sweat.
You recognize them, one is Louis, one of the

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:16.054
agents who fled from the research facility that
you were then going after, and the other is Thed,

00:15:16.054 --> 00:15:20.618
the halfling fellow with the neck tattoo that you
saved in the sewers not but a week and half

00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:22.709
earlier. They are both bloodied--

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:24.160
MARISHA: The one we got the information from.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.711
LAURA: Yeah! I remember he was trapped down by the
spider.

00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:27.990
TRAVIS: The first guy's name was Louis?

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.817
MATT: Yes.

00:15:28.817 --> 00:15:30.497
MARISHA: Louis and Thed?

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:33.681
MATT: Yes. They are both bloodied and tensely
attempting to pummel the other into

00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:38.737
unconsciousness. The people seem to be happily
cheering it on as they go.

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:40.526
MARISHA: Wait, who was Louis?

00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:41.941
TRAVIS: From the research facility?

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.182
MATT: There were three people that went there and
fled the research facility.

00:15:44.182 --> 00:15:45.495
LAURA: The ones we made fun of.

00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:46.052
MATT: Yes.

00:15:46.052 --> 00:15:47.453
LAURA: Woo, go Thed!

00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:48.761
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's right.

00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:50.565
SAM: Research facility?

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:53.298
LAURA: I'm going to jump up on the table and watch
it.

00:15:53.298 --> 00:15:56.346
MARISHA: The ones that we hazed. The Gentlemen's
guys that we talked to before we went to go kill

00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:58.091
the will-o'-wisps.

00:15:58.091 --> 00:15:59.838
SAM: Oh! Got it.

00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:06.390
MATT: Jester ascends to one of the nearby untaken
tables and watches down into the mix. Thed crawls

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:11.388
upward, fists up in front of his face, trying to
guard. He goes for a duck, and comes in for an

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:16.260
uppercut. Louis slaps it away, but it still
manages to catch the edge of his jaw. He slaps his

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.513
head a little bit to the side and as such he
pushes off, and gives a kick to the chest of Thed,

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:25.568
who falls back a second and goes to his back leg,
and comes forward with a huge haymaker. Louis

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:30.192
tries to back out of the way but it comes at an
upward angle, slams into the side of his temple.

00:16:30.192 --> 00:16:34.552
You watch as his face goes starry eyed for a
second as he tries to grab the edge of one of the

00:16:34.552 --> 00:16:39.476
chairs to catch himself. Thed runs up and then
knees him right in the center of the chest and

00:16:39.476 --> 00:16:44.431
stomach region, and you hear the (pained moan).
The whole group goes "Oh!" around, and you watch

00:16:44.431 --> 00:16:50.230
as Louis pushes off the chair and steps back and
tries to back swing towards Thed. Thed slaps it

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:55.215
out of the way, and goes in for a headbutt. It's
at this point that Louis appears to have pulled

00:16:55.215 --> 00:17:03.153
something from his back pocket, and as he swings
his hand upwards, a scattering of sand and dust

00:17:03.153 --> 00:17:08.028
goes into Thed's face, who backs up going (pained
yell), starts to rub it right into his face. He

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:12.565
begins to step away, trying to get his fists up.
Louis uses the opportunity to go forward and sweep

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:17.183
his legs out from under him. As he hits the
ground, chest up, he goes into a double handed

00:17:17.183 --> 00:17:23.360
hammer fist right down into Thed's chest. The air
escapes him. Once again, the crowd goes "Oooh!"

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.606
There's a slight in the back from the Gentlemen,
who's trying to watch over the shoulders of everybody.

00:17:28.628 --> 00:17:30.693
LAURA: Jump up on the table, you can see better!

00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:36.204
MATT: This first time he's acknowledged your
entry, he gives you a look over going, a bit of a

00:17:36.204 --> 00:17:42.301
smile from the distance. Louis goes for a
secondary blow. However, Thed manages to push off.

00:17:42.301 --> 00:17:49.169
His smaller halfling form able to dexterously
dodge out of the way. He's got one eye partially

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:56.866
open, the other one watering thick, and he waits
and paces himself for a moment. Louis, however,

00:17:56.866 --> 00:18:02.907
follows up behind it very quickly and goes for a
knee straight to Thed's face. It slams in, and as

00:18:02.907 --> 00:18:07.158
he backs up you can see the nose is permanently
pushed to one side, and blood is pouring down the

00:18:07.158 --> 00:18:12.233
front of his face. He has a hand up. You can't
tell if he's going to say he's going to stop or if

00:18:12.233 --> 00:18:18.241
he's trying to defend, and there's no one looking
over this battle to stop it if it happens.

00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:22.378
SAM: I turn to Mollymauk and say: I got three gold
on Thed.

00:18:23.158 --> 00:18:25.766
TALIESIN: Seems a little late for a wager at this
point.

00:18:25.766 --> 00:18:27.418
SAM: Just you and me.

00:18:27.418 --> 00:18:28.580
TALIESIN: Fair, I'm in.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:38.782
MATT: Louis comes in to try and finish off what he
started. Thed waits for the final moment and then

00:18:38.782 --> 00:18:45.278
ducks down below, gets underneath and between the
legs of Louis, and lifts, throwing him up, ass

00:18:45.278 --> 00:18:50.119
over tea kettle, until he slams on the back of the
ground. He turns around, wiping the other eye out

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:58.051
of the way. He pulls his leg up and attempts to
stomp down onto Louis's neck, and connects.

00:18:58.051 --> 00:19:01.775
Immediately there's a (choking) and he's holding
him to the ground and jamming and grinding his

00:19:01.775 --> 00:19:05.561
heel into his throat. Everyone's shouting, "Get
him!"

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:06.534
LAURA: Finish him!

00:19:06.534 --> 00:19:08.185
TRAVIS: Should we stop this?

00:19:08.185 --> 00:19:10.717
MARISHA: What? Why would you?

00:19:11.057 --> 00:19:16.577
MATT: Louis is desperately trying to pull the boot of
Thed up off his throat, but Thed's able to keep it

00:19:17.026 --> 00:19:20.902
down. He's pushing and pushing. He spits blood
right in the face of Louis, like onto one of his

00:19:20.902 --> 00:19:32.529
eyes. The consciousness of Louis begins to fade,
eyes roll back, and then eventually, as the rest

00:19:32.529 --> 00:19:36.965
of his body goes limp, they pull Thed off. "Yeah!"
They cheer and lift him up and carry him off. They

00:19:36.965 --> 00:19:40.950
pull Louis up into a chair and start slapping
him and pour water in his face. He

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:46.051
comes to consciousness and spits out a tooth, and
then the crowd's energy begins to die down a bit,

00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:49.309
and they drag them to different sides of the room
and the people being to go about their business,

00:19:49.309 --> 00:19:51.167
get another drink at the bar.

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:52.454
SAM: That was amazing.

00:19:52.454 --> 00:19:53.947
LAURA: Does that happen often in here?

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.668
SAM: Thank you!

00:19:57.365 --> 00:19:59.284
TALIESIN: Shit.

00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:02.012
SAM: That's the fury of the small.

00:20:05.754 --> 00:20:07.262
MARISHA: That was awesome.

00:20:07.421 --> 00:20:08.818
LAURA: Fight me!

00:20:08.818 --> 00:20:09.520
MARISHA: Okay!

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.672
LAURA: Fight me right now! Do you want to do it?

00:20:13.892 --> 00:20:18.626
MATT: As you're doing that, some of the crowd that
had began to disperse suddenly turns and starts

00:20:18.626 --> 00:20:20.347
tapping each other.

00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:24.172
MARISHA: What are the rules?

00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:25.711
LAURA: Just hit each other!

00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:26.513
MARISHA: Okay!

00:20:26.513 --> 00:20:30.677
MATT: (laughing) Do you wa-- Okay!

00:20:30.677 --> 00:20:32.892
LIAM: Round one!

00:20:33.773 --> 00:20:39.371
MATT: You both charge into the center, starting
seemingly with no purpose other then the necessary

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:42.047
adrenaline to kickstart the rest of your evening.

00:20:42.047 --> 00:20:43.946
TALIESIN: Not like it hasn't happened before.

00:20:43.946 --> 00:20:45.535
MATT: I need you both to roll initiative.

00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:50.345
LIAM: I cast Haste on Beauregard.

00:20:50.345 --> 00:20:53.237
LAURA: You piece of shit!

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:56.675
MARISHA: What does that mean?

00:20:56.675 --> 00:20:58.480
LAURA: 22!

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.139
MARISHA: Do I get to roll twice?

00:21:00.139 --> 00:21:01.299
MATT: Roll initiative.

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:03.806
MARISHA: Okay. I did. 17.

00:21:03.806 --> 00:21:05.703
MATT: Okay but-- Hold on, let me check real fast.

00:21:05.703 --> 00:21:08.223
LIAM: It's licorice. I just need licorice.

00:21:08.223 --> 00:21:09.581
TALIESIN: Did I notice him casting Haste?

00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:10.680
LIAM: I didn't try to hide it.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.025
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:21:12.025 --> 00:21:13.243
TRAVIS: (Laughing) Okay.

00:21:13.243 --> 00:21:16.705
MATT: Saving throws, not ability checks. You don't
get advantage on your initiative.

00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:18.129
MARISHA: All right, 17.

00:21:18.129 --> 00:21:26.223
MATT: You feel this sudden strange surge of
adrenaline and energy. Time around you seems to

00:21:26.223 --> 00:21:31.249
slow ever so slightly as you watch Jester starting
rushing in, swinging towards you, faster than you

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:32.398
expect though. What are you doing?

00:21:32.398 --> 00:21:35.427
LAURA: I'm going to punch her in the face and cast
Inflict Wounds.

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:36.854
SAM: Oh Jesus!

00:21:36.854 --> 00:21:38.213
MARISHA: What!

00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:41.053
TRAVIS: You just got this!

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:43.931
MATT: At first level?

00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:45.437
MARISHA: I thought we were having funsies!

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:48.508
LAURA: At first level. I could do it at third, but
I'm doing it at first.

00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:52.193
MATT: Okay, so it's a relatively soft punch as
you're using it as a delivery method for the spell.

00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:53.442
LAURA: Yeah.

00:21:53.442 --> 00:21:57.253
MATT: So it doesn't do any actual punch damage.
However, you do have to roll to see if you

00:21:57.253 --> 00:21:59.542
connect, so a melee spell attack.

00:22:01.662 --> 00:22:03.953
LAURA: 18!

00:22:06.102 --> 00:22:08.525
MARISHA: That hits.

00:22:08.525 --> 00:22:09.989
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

00:22:09.989 --> 00:22:11.529
LAURA: Oh no.

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:13.196
MATT: I believe that 3d10 necrotic.

00:22:13.196 --> 00:22:15.376
LAURA: 3d10. I think so.

00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:16.722
SAM: Oh god!

00:22:16.722 --> 00:22:20.628
MARISHA: Let's wrestle! Okay! Mace in your face!

00:22:20.628 --> 00:22:23.384
TRAVIS: Third level is like 5d10.

00:22:23.384 --> 00:22:25.266
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:29.029
MATT: Let's thumb wrestle, and you shoot him in
the head. Like what?

00:22:29.449 --> 00:22:30.755
LAURA: 17?

00:22:30.755 --> 00:22:32.894
MARISHA: Holy fuck balls!

00:22:32.894 --> 00:22:38.058
MATT: Suddenly your energy is instilled within
your body, your vision goes wide, all the colors

00:22:38.058 --> 00:22:44.362
come into focus and you look up to see Jester to
distract yourself from the sudden sensation you've

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:48.703
never experienced before. The one thing you see is
this fist connect with your chest, and you all

00:22:48.703 --> 00:22:55.453
watch as a series of blood vessels in the sides of
Beauregard's face and neck suddenly burst and

00:22:55.453 --> 00:23:00.874
splash blood in different directions. You see
white for a second. Your body racked with pain and

00:23:00.874 --> 00:23:05.363
you recoil briefly from the sudden shock to your
system.

00:23:05.363 --> 00:23:11.804
TRAVIS: With this flash of action, I mask my voice
and go: I've got five gold on the horny one!

00:23:11.804 --> 00:23:17.741
MARISHA: The fuck, Jester?!

00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:18.900
LAURA: I don't know!

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:24.683
MARISHA: Boom! Boom! Boom! I'm going to do some Ip
man like (punching noises). Like all the way down

00:23:24.683 --> 00:23:30.499
her spine. Right in the fucking ribs. Yeah, going
for that.

00:23:30.499 --> 00:23:32.039
MATT: You've got two attacks now.

00:23:33.033 --> 00:23:36.046
LIAM: Caleb is stress chewing on the licorice root
that he used to cast the spell.

00:23:36.046 --> 00:23:39.967
MATT: You don't have your shield for this because
you're fist fighting. So your AC is technically two lower.

00:23:40.414 --> 00:23:43.664
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:23:44.946 --> 00:23:48.835
MARISHA: Okay the first one definitely hits with a
20.

00:23:48.835 --> 00:23:49.650
LAURA: Yeah.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:54.095
MARISHA: The second one is a 15.

00:23:54.095 --> 00:23:55.421
LAURA: No, it doesn't hit!

00:23:57.541 --> 00:24:00.404
MARISHA: Okay, and then I'm going to spend a ki to
do stunning strike.

00:24:00.404 --> 00:24:02.729
MATT: What's your AC normally?

00:24:02.729 --> 00:24:04.115
LAURA: Normally 18.

00:24:04.115 --> 00:24:04.889
MATT: Yeah.

00:24:04.889 --> 00:24:06.236
TRAVIS: She's cracking it out!

00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.892
MARISHA: Okay, wait, hang on.

00:24:07.892 --> 00:24:09.340
LAURA: I should have done it 3rd-level!

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.113
MARISHA: As in one ki-- Do I have to-- Hang on.
Sorry!

00:24:11.113 --> 00:24:12.331
MATT: You roll damage.

00:24:12.331 --> 00:24:13.425
MARISHA: Roll damage and then do I do?

00:24:13.425 --> 00:24:19.382
MATT: And then she has to make a saving throw. I
believe it's a constitution saving throw.

00:24:19.382 --> 00:24:23.042
MARISHA: Not great damage. Seven damage.

00:24:23.042 --> 00:24:26.794
MATT: Seven points of bludgeoning damage as she
begins to pummel you repeatedly, across the front

00:24:26.794 --> 00:24:32.838
of the face, down into the side of the torso, and
I need you to roll a constitution saving throw

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:33.875
please, Jester.

00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:38.680
LAURA: Oh god. Oh no.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.091
ASHLEY: You guys are fucking each other up.

00:24:43.091 --> 00:24:45.160
LAURA: Five! No! Six. Oh no.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:51.355
MATT: Okay, as she continues down your torso
there's one portion on the back of your armor

00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:57.209
where your spine is exposed beyond the clothing
you're wearing, and after she finishes the round

00:24:57.209 --> 00:25:01.674
she uses the momentum and strikes straight into
base of the spine where the nerve would divide

00:25:01.674 --> 00:25:06.778
down to the pelvis, and your entire body locks up,
all your muscles all spasm at once. You are stunned.

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:10.502
MARISHA: Can I have another attack action because
of haste?

00:25:10.502 --> 00:25:12.755
LAURA: I think I pooped myself a little.

00:25:12.755 --> 00:25:15.802
TRAVIS: I walk over to the other side of the crowd
and go: I got ten gold on the one with the

00:25:15.802 --> 00:25:20.160
bandages! Trying to whip up a betting frenzy.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:28.796
MATT: The haste doesn't give you a fourth attack.
What does haste does is it gives you--

00:25:28.796 --> 00:25:31.023
LIAM: An extra attack action.

00:25:31.023 --> 00:25:35.171
MATT: An extra attack action, yeah. You have your
bonus action so yeah. You can attack with your

00:25:35.171 --> 00:25:39.566
staff if you want to, whatever your main attack is
and then you still have your bonus action.

00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:40.722
MARISHA: And I still have my bonus action?

00:25:40.722 --> 00:25:41.259
MATT: Yes.

00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:42.947
MARISHA: Because my stunning strike didn't use my
bonus action, right?

00:25:42.947 --> 00:25:43.886
MATT: Correct.

00:25:43.886 --> 00:25:48.009
MARISHA: Okay. That's not great. That misses. It
was a natural four.

00:25:48.009 --> 00:25:50.134
MATT: Hold on, she is stunned.

00:25:50.134 --> 00:25:51.563
MARISHA: Oh right! She's stunned!

00:25:51.563 --> 00:25:52.753
MATT: Attack rolls against her are at advantage.
You roll again.

00:25:52.753 --> 00:25:57.945
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

00:25:57.945 --> 00:26:03.632
MATT: This hit you do pull back and hit the armor
unfortunately, and your fingers snap back a bit,

00:26:03.632 --> 00:26:06.058
you feel the numbness from the attack.

00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:07.177
LAURA: That was my shield!

00:26:07.177 --> 00:26:08.356
MARISHA: You keep your shield in your ass?

00:26:08.356 --> 00:26:09.207
LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:09.207 --> 00:26:13.687
MARISHA: Ow! Then I have one more bonus action,
right?

00:26:13.687 --> 00:26:14.756
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:26:14.756 --> 00:26:21.857
MARISHA: Okay, that's good. That's 19 to hit.

00:26:21.857 --> 00:26:24.204
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

00:26:25.535 --> 00:26:27.185
MARISHA: Six!

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:32.783
MATT: That's six bludgeoning damage to you. As
Beau recoils from this and steadies herself from

00:26:32.783 --> 00:26:40.145
this round, Jester you are unable to move. You're
sluggishly trying to get your joints to function

00:26:40.145 --> 00:26:45.779
again, you try and speak and it comes out in a
stuttering phrase that fades away, your tongue not

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:47.114
listening to your impact.

00:26:47.114 --> 00:26:50.497
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and ASHLEY: (chanting) Level
five! Level five!

00:26:51.122 --> 00:26:53.407
MARISHA: Right in that sciatic nerve! Right in
there.

00:26:53.407 --> 00:26:54.451
LAURA: Oh no, it hurts already.

00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:55.976
MATT: Too close to home.

00:26:55.976 --> 00:26:57.683
LIAM: Beat that practice dummy!

00:26:58.957 --> 00:27:02.146
MATT: That ends your turn. Back to Beau.

00:27:02.146 --> 00:27:03.485
MARISHA: I'm going to just do--

00:27:03.485 --> 00:27:04.563
MATT: You are no longer stunned.

00:27:04.563 --> 00:27:10.038
MARISHA: Once again take my staff out and I'm
going to gut strike her right in the stomach. The

00:27:10.038 --> 00:27:14.730
first attack, that's a natural 18.

00:27:15.429 --> 00:27:18.170
MATT: Let me double check and see when the actual
stun wears off.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.964
SAM: And I'll take five. Five gold, I've got
Jester.

00:27:21.964 --> 00:27:26.611
MATT: Until the end of your next turn, so you
still have advantage on attacks against her.

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:33.871
MARISHA: Let's see if-- Okay, no. I'll take that
18. That first strike is 12 damage with my staff.

00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:38.242
MATT: 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the staff
slams right into your clavicle, shoulder area,

00:27:38.242 --> 00:27:39.412
almost knocking you off your feet.

00:27:39.412 --> 00:27:47.857
MARISHA: Then I'm supposed to state flurry of
blows as my bonus, right?

00:27:47.857 --> 00:27:48.948
MATT: Correct, yes.

00:27:48.948 --> 00:27:51.050
MARISHA: But I get one more attack and then I can
do flurry of blows.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.072
LAURA: I'm going to use my reaction, because I'm
not stunned, to use Hellish Rebuke on you.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.739
MATT: Technically, you're still stunned until the
end of her turn.

00:27:55.739 --> 00:27:58.418
LAURA: Fuck!

00:27:58.418 --> 00:27:59.935
LIAM: Is what Jester thought.

00:27:59.935 --> 00:28:03.772
MARISHA: Second attack. Okay. 18.

00:28:03.772 --> 00:28:06.030
MATT: 18 hits.

00:28:06.312 --> 00:28:09.959
MARISHA: This is still my regular attacks.

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:13.136
MATT: This is still the second strike with the
staff after one knocking her back from the

00:28:13.136 --> 00:28:14.457
shoulder blow.

00:28:14.457 --> 00:28:20.355
MARISHA: I'm going to do a six damage crack just
right in her gut, knock the wind out of her.

00:28:20.355 --> 00:28:23.387
MATT: The wind gets knocked out of you from a
sudden blow to your stomach area.

00:28:23.387 --> 00:28:25.581
MARISHA: And I'm going to do flurry of blows.

00:28:25.581 --> 00:28:26.975
LAURA: Oh no!

00:28:28.379 --> 00:28:31.540
TALIESIN: Blood curse of the eyeless. Full
strength.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.187
MATT: All right, go ahead and take your damage.

00:28:33.187 --> 00:28:34.312
TRAVIS: On who?

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:40.481
MATT: All of a sudden your vision goes black. For
whatever reason where we saw the brief burst of

00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:45.118
the veins from the first strike from Jester, you
watch as bits of crimson begin to pour out the

00:28:45.118 --> 00:28:47.493
corners of Beau's mouth, as her eyes go over
black.

00:28:47.493 --> 00:28:48.488
MARISHA: Motherfucker.

00:28:48.488 --> 00:28:51.464
MATT: You don't have advantage, it's just a
straight roll for your attacks.

00:28:51.464 --> 00:28:56.383
MARISHA: Okay, first one. 14.

00:28:56.383 --> 00:28:57.623
LAURA: Nope.

00:28:57.623 --> 00:29:01.712
MARISHA: Second one. No, even worse, natural four.

00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:11.629
MATT: Eventually your vision comes back, but your
knuckles hurt from the fact that you just punched

00:29:11.629 --> 00:29:14.165
twice in the thickest parts of her breast plate.

00:29:14.165 --> 00:29:16.577
MARISHA: And I have one more attack action, right?

00:29:16.577 --> 00:29:20.343
MATT: Because of haste, you do. Yes, and that one
has advantage.

00:29:22.086 --> 00:29:24.560
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 14, 20 total.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.296
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

00:29:27.624 --> 00:29:29.197
MARISHA: Another 12 damage.

00:29:29.197 --> 00:29:30.804
LAURA: Aww no! I'm unconscious!

00:29:30.804 --> 00:29:33.263
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:29:35.037 --> 00:29:36.047
MATT: And with that--

00:29:36.047 --> 00:29:37.053
MARISHA: It was pretty good, though.

00:29:37.053 --> 00:29:41.993
MATT: Jester got one good opening blow, and
then--

00:29:41.993 --> 00:29:45.120
LAURA: And then Caleb fucked me.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.734
MATT: I mean, partially, but you also chose a fist
fight against a monk, which is a rough scenario.

00:29:49.734 --> 00:29:51.379
MARISHA: Fight club!

00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:54.529
MATT: The whole crowd goes, "Yeah!"

00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:56.310
MARISHA: Sorry Jester.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.538
MATT: Jester's unconscious.

00:29:57.538 --> 00:30:01.010
MARISHA: Oh wait, I thought you were going to
Fjord. I'm sorry.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.080
LIAM: Oh, no I'm just being my same, awkward self.
It's fine.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.540
SAM: Guys, she's our healer.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.045
MARISHA: Oh shit.

00:30:09.045 --> 00:30:13.232
SAM: Can someone-- she's dying right now.

00:30:13.232 --> 00:30:17.971
MATT: You watch as one of the patrons of the bar
comes up with a small jug of

00:30:17.971 --> 00:30:20.178
water and throws it in her face.

00:30:20.178 --> 00:30:23.778
LAURA: (coughing) Whoa!

00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:25.451
SAM: Is she okay?

00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:27.043
MATT: She's at one hit point.

00:30:27.043 --> 00:30:31.210
LAURA: That was seriously awesome!

00:30:32.142 --> 00:30:37.212
MARISHA: So awesome! Dude, what did you do? That
was crazy.

00:30:37.212 --> 00:30:40.434
LAURA: I would have done it worse, but
I thought we were taking it easy on

00:30:40.434 --> 00:30:42.106
each other and then you went crazy on me.

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:44.965
MARISHA: Well, I got a little blood lusty after
that. I'm so sorry.

00:30:44.965 --> 00:30:48.170
LAURA: I understand completely. How come you were
you hitting me so much though? Because usually you

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.848
don't have that much speed.

00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:54.555
MARISHA: I don't really know. Do I know that he
cast Haste on me? Would I be aware of that?

00:30:54.555 --> 00:30:57.914
MATT: Not at the moment, no, and you're still
affected by it.

00:30:57.914 --> 00:31:01.360
MARISHA: I don't know. Maybe it was a relapse of
the those mushrooms that Molly and I did.

00:31:01.948 --> 00:31:03.243
I don't know.

00:31:03.243 --> 00:31:04.475
LAURA: That was a while ago.

00:31:04.475 --> 00:31:06.144
TRAVIS: Talking super fast. All coked up.

00:31:06.144 --> 00:31:10.083
MARISHA: It's really great. I don't know. I feel
really good about myself right now.

00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:14.162
MATT: At about this point in the conversation, the
adrenaline leaves your body, and you almost keel

00:31:14.162 --> 00:31:17.071
over. You become, suddenly, super lethargic and
exhausted.

00:31:17.071 --> 00:31:18.277
MARISHA: (groans) Oh god.

00:31:18.277 --> 00:31:19.544
LIAM: Definitely the mushrooms.

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:25.082
MARISHA: We're going to take a nap after this,
right?

00:31:25.082 --> 00:31:26.697
TRAVIS: Nah, we're walking out of this city,
miles.

00:31:26.697 --> 00:31:27.992
MARISHA: Ah fuck.

00:31:27.992 --> 00:31:32.095
LIAM: I send Frumpkin over to start lapping the
blood off of Jester's face.

00:31:32.943 --> 00:31:39.707
LAURA: Oh, hi Frumpkin. You're a little, evil
creature that drinks blood!

00:31:41.532 --> 00:31:45.311
MATT: The crowd begins to go back to their
scenarios. Some of them seem confused by the

00:31:45.311 --> 00:31:49.176
display of joyous hugging afterwards.
Some seem to be down with it and are like,

00:31:49.176 --> 00:31:50.723
"Yeah, this is what it is about!"

00:31:50.723 --> 00:31:59.001
MARISHA: I take my canteen and clean Jester up and
trying to help her out. Now that the adrenaline's

00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:00.976
wearing off, I'm feeling a little guilty.

00:32:00.976 --> 00:32:03.598
LAURA: No, it's totally fine. I did it to myself.

00:32:04.161 --> 00:32:08.609
MATT: Sitting on one of the table edges, you see
Dweez, the little creepy gnome who you met

00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:13.679
earlier, who's like, (breathy laugh).

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:17.848
LAURA: I don't like him. That was creepy.

00:32:17.848 --> 00:32:23.534
MATT: At this point, a familiar voice kicks up
from the back corner, "Friends, come sit. Thank

00:32:23.534 --> 00:32:29.193
"you for such a fine display of sportsmanship."

00:32:29.632 --> 00:32:33.359
TRAVIS: That's us. Always down for a scrap.

00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:40.827
MATT: "Apparently." The Gentleman now sits there.
His comfortable attire today comes in a billowing

00:32:40.827 --> 00:32:48.958
linen, a dark navy blue shirt that frills at the
wrists. You can see his rings and jewelry

00:32:48.958 --> 00:32:54.485
available as his fingers are crossed and partially
stapled-- steepled in front of him. Not stapled to

00:32:54.485 --> 00:32:58.805
him. That's a whole different thing. Ah! Oh god!

00:32:59.464 --> 00:33:02.055
LAURA: I'm going to use this time talking to him
as a short rest.

00:33:02.055 --> 00:33:03.068
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:33:03.068 --> 00:33:04.355
MATT and SAM: That's an hour.

00:33:04.355 --> 00:33:05.759
LAURA: Well, hopefully--

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:14.898
MATT: You spend an hour here, and you'll be fine.
"Thank you for coming so quickly."

00:33:14.898 --> 00:33:21.487
TRAVIS: Of course. It didn't seem like our options
above ground were all that plentiful. We were more

00:33:21.487 --> 00:33:23.637
than anxious to hear what you might offer.

00:33:23.637 --> 00:33:28.974
MATT: "Rather tenuous times these are, wouldn't
you say? Word is the breach of the Ashguard

00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:37.158
"Garrison was a massacre, and now the skies there
hang dark with ill-magic. I'm glad that's hundreds

00:33:37.158 --> 00:33:43.131
"of miles from here, though. Now with the bulk of
the military moving east, and the Crownsguard

00:33:43.384 --> 00:33:48.643
"stretched thin, we should begin bolstering our
plots, yes?"

00:33:48.643 --> 00:33:49.508
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:33:49.747 --> 00:33:52.598
SAM: What does that mean?

00:33:52.598 --> 00:33:59.970
MATT: "Well, a distracted empire is an easy empire
to bend to our will. Or at least, to not pay

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.435
"attention to what we're doing."

00:34:02.435 --> 00:34:06.291
TRAVIS: Indeed. I assume it doesn't mean
overthrowing it.

00:34:06.291 --> 00:34:09.321
More manipulating it to your
individual gain.

00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:12.369
MATT: "Oh, I have no interest in political
endeavors. Just the more confused they are, the

00:34:12.369 --> 00:34:13.653
"better for business."

00:34:14.945 --> 00:34:16.974
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:34:16.974 --> 00:34:24.492
MATT: "I have a few possible jobs here, if you're
interested. I don't mean to act so quickly, but

00:34:24.492 --> 00:34:31.350
"word comes to me that you had been summoned to the
King's Hall. I would hate to think I missed the

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:37.989
"opportunity to get more work under your wing,
before losing you to some unfortunate, state-based

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:46.674
"conscription. First order of business, should you
be interested." He leans forwards and sets his

00:34:46.674 --> 00:34:54.687
"glass a little further from the edge. His voice
hushes a bit as he leans in, "I've some friends to

00:34:54.687 --> 00:35:03.638

with. Allies, who would be very profitable

attention, at the moment, and I have a hard time

missions!"

00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:14.981
SAM: He means Louis.

00:35:15.288 --> 00:35:17.598
MATT: "Anyway, if you have any interests--"

00:35:17.598 --> 00:35:19.248
MARISHA: Fucking Louis.

00:35:19.248 --> 00:35:25.397
MATT: "Indeed." You glance back over your shoulder
and see Louis at the bar, who's still dazed and

00:35:25.397 --> 00:35:34.502
"drinking a giant cup of ale and wiping the blood
off of his whole torso. "If you've interest in

"making coin, doing some interesting work and
getting to see most of our beautiful, imperial

"countryside, I can go on."

00:35:43.992 --> 00:35:46.134
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> who are these friends of yours up
north?

00:35:46.134 --> 00:35:53.594
MATT: "An old friend of mine, named Ophelia
Mardun. She has a base of operations about 350

00:35:53.594 --> 00:36:00.873
"miles northeast of here. Past Nogvurot and the
Quannah Breach, on the outskirts of Shadycreek

00:36:00.873 --> 00:36:03.522
"Run. I'm sure you've heard of it."

00:36:03.522 --> 00:36:05.351
LAURA: Yes, we have, actually.

00:36:05.351 --> 00:36:12.239
MATT: "A sovereign town, outside of the Dwendalian
Empire and outside of the law. That uses the

00:37:15.193 --> 00:37:16.169
SAM: Question.

00:37:16.169 --> 00:37:17.111
MATT: "Yes?"

00:37:17.111 --> 00:37:19.332
SAM: Will she come willingly?

00:37:19.332 --> 00:37:24.206
MATT: "She will, once you manage to free her from
her predicament."

00:37:24.206 --> 00:37:25.907
SAM: Oh.

00:37:25.907 --> 00:37:30.347
LIAM: Complications, predicament, do you have any
more specifics than that, perhaps?

00:37:30.347 --> 00:37:38.077
MATT: "I do not. That is the intent and language
she used, when last we had correspondence. I think

"the nature of her business, much like ours, is
meant to be on an absolutely necessary basis only.

00:37:47.379 --> 00:37:50.058
"I'm sure once you speak to her, you'll have better
information on that."

00:37:50.516 --> 00:37:53.220
TRAVIS: A tantalizing offer. You said you had
others?

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:59.242
MATT: "I do. If this seems to be beyond your
depth, I'd hate to see the coin go to someone

00:37:59.242 --> 00:38:01.248
"else, but I understand."

00:38:01.248 --> 00:38:05.228
LIAM: No, we are interested in more of a buffet,
here today.

00:38:05.228 --> 00:38:13.192
MATT: "Understood. That underground tunnel, that
you've already visited, happens to be a major

straight up to the Lebenda Swamp. The Lebenda

until you need to find them. As well as a direct

rather worried that no shipments have made their

your friend up to Berleben last week, it was

went to investigate and never returned. Now the

"swamp-folk are a superstitious lot, an unfortunate
facet with working with them."

00:38:57.203 --> 00:38:58.984
LAURA: Like swap creatures?

00:38:58.984 --> 00:39:04.928
MATT: "And the like, I'm sure of it. My contacts
in town are refusing to investigate, recounting

00:39:05.184 --> 00:39:15.653
"howls from the deep swamp. I would need you to
head up to Berleben. Locate a fellow named Febron

the Puddles. The Puddles is the part of the town

shipments, and the only one who knows where our

fucking missing. Meet with him, secure the safe

00:39:35.133 --> 00:39:42.726
"house and its contents, and return to me. Consider
a 250 gold piece advance and a purse of 1,750 gold

00:39:42.726 --> 00:39:49.636
"pieces upon completion. Heck, if you can handle
both (laughs) and with timely mind, there might be

00:39:49.636 --> 00:39:50.492
"a bonus."

00:39:50.492 --> 00:39:54.837
LIAM: As a sidebar, should we be worried about our
friend that we sent north to that area?

00:39:54.837 --> 00:39:56.364
MARISHA: Yeah, where's Horris?

00:39:56.364 --> 00:40:00.462
MATT: "Oh, he's in Berleben. He should be fine.
This is all based in the swamp."

00:40:00.462 --> 00:40:02.491
LAURA: Leading to Berleben.

00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:06.380
TRAVIS: Could you describe your friend, Vabron?

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.421
MARISHA, LIAM, and LAURA: Febron Keyes.

00:40:08.421 --> 00:40:20.596
MATT: "Febron Keyes, (chuckles) he's memorable.
Based by his fairly emanate lack of teeth. His one

00:40:20.596 --> 00:40:28.044
"wandering left eye. A bit of a skin condition."

00:40:28.044 --> 00:40:30.700
TRAVIS: No grill, busted eye. Okay.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.135
MARISHA: I just drooled a little. Oh god.

00:40:33.135 --> 00:40:35.272
MATT: "But he's good at the work he does."

00:40:35.272 --> 00:40:37.842
SAM: What work is that?

00:40:37.842 --> 00:40:43.990
MATT: "Keeping his mouth shut and knowing where
the secrets are and not giving those secrets up.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:48.651
"He's been pressed for it a few times and has
proven to be trustworthy, and I admire that."

00:40:48.651 --> 00:40:52.111
TRAVIS: Would we have the same sort of timetable
for this mission, a month?

00:40:52.111 --> 00:40:57.182
MATT: "The sooner the better, as the longer these
shipments continues to elude us, the more money

00:40:57.182 --> 00:41:02.359
"we're losing. Like I said, a timely manner, there
may be a bonus."

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:04.706
TRAVIS: Anything else?

00:41:04.706 --> 00:41:09.861
MATT: "Those are the two at the moment. If those
don't tickle your fancy, I'm sure we could have

00:41:09.861 --> 00:41:16.071
"another opportunity in the next week or two. I
just would hate to see these go to less qualified

00:41:16.071 --> 00:41:18.243
"individuals."

00:41:18.243 --> 00:41:21.638
TRAVIS: Well, perhaps we'll partake of some
beverages and discuss.

00:41:21.638 --> 00:41:22.157
MATT: "Of course."

00:41:22.157 --> 00:41:31.057
SAM: One more thing though, our other offer was
for 10,000 gold. Seems like maybe you could match

00:41:31.057 --> 00:41:37.479
that just to make it a little bit more equal?

00:41:37.479 --> 00:41:47.721
MATT: "You mistake this business as some sort of a
push for an inherently equal pay, my friend. I

00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:53.892
"don't know what business the Crown wishes to offer
you, but I can guarantee you it has a ceiling."

00:41:53.892 --> 00:42:00.313
LAURA: Okay, well the other side of that was that
we would get access to some potions and supplies

00:42:00.313 --> 00:42:05.772
and stuff. Is this something you can provide to us
when we go on missions for you?

00:42:06.455 --> 00:42:08.497
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:42:11.132 --> 00:42:12.510
LAURA: Natural 20!

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.888
(cheering)

00:42:16.024 --> 00:42:18.717
LAURA: I wipe a little blood from my mouth.

00:42:19.343 --> 00:42:22.024
MARISHA: Super endearing with that black eye.

00:42:22.024 --> 00:42:23.275
TRAVIS: Anime sparkles.

00:42:23.275 --> 00:42:28.227
MATT: You're leaning on one leg a little bit,
unintentionally leaning in.

00:42:28.227 --> 00:42:31.919
TRAVIS: Your one busted eye is wandering.

00:42:31.919 --> 00:42:34.211
LIAM: Return of the Vex.

00:42:34.211 --> 00:42:41.869
MATT: "I'm sure we could provide a few supplies.
Remember, we try not to dip into our own

00:42:41.869 --> 00:42:50.596
"contraband, but we could assume that we could
provide some things, yes."

00:42:50.596 --> 00:42:54.952
LIAM: Does that contraband include high-quality
paper and ink?

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.255
MATT: "We can provide paper and ink, sure."

00:42:58.255 --> 00:43:00.878
MARISHA: You know what contraband means, right?

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:03.409
LIAM: High-quality paper and ink.

00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:04.902
TRAVIS: We'll learn him, it's all right.

00:43:04.902 --> 00:43:06.239
MARISHA: Okay.

00:43:06.239 --> 00:43:09.894
TRAVIS: Give us some time to discuss, and we'll
get back to you shortly.

00:43:09.894 --> 00:43:16.428
MATT: "Of course. Well, drink, be merry. You know
where to find me."

00:43:16.428 --> 00:43:19.597
TRAVIS: Is there an open booth or--

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:20.676
TALIESIN: The darkest.

00:43:20.676 --> 00:43:22.787
TRAVIS: Yeah, the darkest corner.

00:43:22.787 --> 00:43:25.472
SAM: Or like a bumper pool table that we can
all--

00:43:25.472 --> 00:43:29.384
MATT: There is that, yeah. It's more like a
shufflepuck thing, with the sand on the side.

00:43:29.384 --> 00:43:30.649
LIAM: Just Pacman table.

00:43:30.649 --> 00:43:31.652
MATT: Yeah.

00:43:31.652 --> 00:43:32.625
TALIESIN: Galaga.

00:43:32.625 --> 00:43:36.776
MATT: The darkest table is the one that is tucked
right inside the spiral staircase, where you enter.

00:43:36.776 --> 00:43:38.229
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

00:43:38.229 --> 00:43:41.876
MATT: Which normally has somebody sitting there,
but at the moment, it looks like they're getting a

00:43:41.876 --> 00:43:44.711
drink. If you swipe it now you'll probably piss
somebody off, but you'll get the table.

00:43:44.711 --> 00:43:46.625
TALIESIN: I pull the full Riker hop over the
chair.

00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:55.634
(laughter)

00:43:55.634 --> 00:44:05.726
MATT: As you guys approach, you can see the same
muscular, thuggish individual with the tanned skin

00:44:05.726 --> 00:44:11.706
and the thick bracers around his rough and tumble
exterior, begins to approach with a large, fully

00:44:11.706 --> 00:44:16.963
filled flagon of ale. Who stops, sees that you're
sitting there and grumbles to himself and finds

00:44:16.963 --> 00:44:25.549
another seat. But you are as private as you can be
in this relatively not private space. You have a table.

00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:29.889
TRAVIS: Well, what do you think?

00:44:29.889 --> 00:44:31.314
LAURA: I think it sounds like fun.

00:44:31.314 --> 00:44:32.214
MARISHA: I agree.

00:44:32.214 --> 00:44:35.748
SAM: Well, Molly, you've been talking about
getting out of town.

00:44:35.748 --> 00:44:36.976
TALIESIN: And it is out of town.

00:44:36.976 --> 00:44:37.875
SAM: It gets us out of town.

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:42.597
TALIESIN: It's almost perfectly out of town. I've
always wanted to go to Deadwood.

00:44:42.597 --> 00:44:47.523
MARISHA: We've already-- yeah. How awesome does
that place sound?

00:44:47.523 --> 00:44:48.668
LAURA: Shadygrove?

00:44:48.668 --> 00:44:49.476
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:44:49.476 --> 00:44:51.235
SAM: The shitty swamp?

00:44:51.235 --> 00:44:52.352
TRAVIS: Shadycreek Run.

00:44:52.352 --> 00:44:56.745
LAURA: No, Shadycreek. Well that would be probably
the second one, right?

00:44:56.745 --> 00:44:57.879
MARISHA: After, yeah.

00:44:57.879 --> 00:44:58.947
TALIESIN: I am feeling greedy.

00:44:58.947 --> 00:45:00.933
LAURA: How do you feel about it, Yasha?

00:45:00.933 --> 00:45:04.734
ASHLEY: I am along for the ride.

00:45:04.734 --> 00:45:05.735
TRAVIS: You have no preference?

00:45:05.735 --> 00:45:15.725
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm up for all of it, you know?
Whatever you guys decide.

00:45:15.725 --> 00:45:21.715
TRAVIS: Any preference to water versus, perhaps,
an abundance of dry ground?

00:45:21.715 --> 00:45:23.112
TALIESIN: Versus both.

00:45:23.112 --> 00:45:28.717
LAURA: Well, I mean, we're all leaning more
towards this than going to the Menagerie Coast for

00:45:28.717 --> 00:45:30.236
the Empire right?

00:45:30.236 --> 00:45:32.762
TALIESIN: Yeah, it does sound like fun.

00:45:32.762 --> 00:45:36.575
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't like contracts. We already
gave our blood to this guy.

00:45:36.575 --> 00:45:37.610
TALIESIN: We're already in.

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:39.838
LAURA: That is as contract-y as contract gets.

00:45:39.838 --> 00:45:40.795
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:45:40.795 --> 00:45:45.252
TRAVIS: Plus, if this is as aggressive as they say
it is, an attack on the border, I'm sure that

00:45:45.252 --> 00:45:49.948
legionnaire's job will be there when we return
anyway. Price might have increased.

00:45:49.948 --> 00:45:56.833
MARISHA: Yeah. Seems like the Empire has enough
money to just throw at problems. I don't think

00:45:56.833 --> 00:45:58.872
that's going to change. Yeah.

00:45:58.872 --> 00:46:04.330
TRAVIS: Better to bet on the underbelly rising up
than the top maintaining what it has.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:08.215
SAM: Also, this way gets us to go straight through
Hupperdook.

00:46:08.215 --> 00:46:12.936
LAURA: (gasps) It does! We can stop by
Hupperdook!

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:13.755
SAM: I'm just saying.

00:46:13.755 --> 00:46:15.119
TRAVIS: Remind me what's in Hupperdook?

00:46:15.119 --> 00:46:16.319
LAURA: I have no idea!

00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:18.576
SAM: It's like a cool name for a town.

00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:22.699
LAURA: I imagine that all of the buildings look
like mushrooms.

00:46:22.699 --> 00:46:25.769
MARISHA: They've got a wax museum. Largest ball of
twine.

00:46:25.769 --> 00:46:27.973
TRAVIS: Hupperdook?

00:46:27.973 --> 00:46:29.371
SAM: Hupperdook!

00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:30.526
MATT: The Branson of Wildemount.

00:46:30.526 --> 00:46:33.478
MARISHA: The Branson of Wildemount, yeah. I hope
it is!

00:46:33.478 --> 00:46:35.595
TRAVIS: Okay, definitely stopping in Hupperdook.

00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:39.727
SAM: They've got a soft serve place there. It'll
be great.

00:46:39.727 --> 00:46:43.886
TRAVIS: So we're going to take that shady
underground river out.

00:46:43.886 --> 00:46:47.222
LAURA: Yes. We have to be careful of those
monsters that came out of the--

00:46:47.222 --> 00:46:55.044
SAM: We know those monsters, though. I took care
of all those traps. Could someone remind me,

00:46:55.044 --> 00:46:59.960
because when The Gentleman looks at me I get a
little bit-- yeah, you know, flippity-flee?

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.136
TRAVIS: Turned on?

00:47:01.136 --> 00:47:04.593
MARISHA: Yeah, that's it. Like <i>into</i> it.

00:47:04.593 --> 00:47:05.563
TRAVIS: Are you crushing on him?

00:47:05.563 --> 00:47:07.782
SAM: No, the sweat thing bothers me.

00:47:07.782 --> 00:47:09.041
LAURA: It's not sweat. I think it's--

00:47:09.041 --> 00:47:09.934
SAM: I think it's sweat.

00:47:09.934 --> 00:47:14.948
LAURA: I'm going to peek around and look at the
Gentleman.

00:47:14.948 --> 00:47:19.117
MATT: Okay. He's back at the far table. He's
currently drinking and it looks like he has a

00:47:19.117 --> 00:47:21.184
small book of some kind that he's thumbing
through.

00:47:21.184 --> 00:47:22.696
SAM and LAURA: Is he moist?

00:47:22.696 --> 00:47:23.880
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.980
LIAM: Are you?

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.950
TRAVIS: How many of us are uncomfortable hearing
that word?

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.277
LIAM: All of us.

00:47:30.277 --> 00:47:31.171
LAURA: Eight.

00:47:31.171 --> 00:47:34.958
MATT: In this low light, it's hard to see. But
when you were speaking to him earlier there was a

00:47:34.958 --> 00:47:37.025
layer of general moisture across his skin.

00:47:37.025 --> 00:47:38.704
LAURA: What kind of shirt is he wearing?

00:47:38.704 --> 00:47:44.961
MATT: The shirt he's wearing now is a navy blue,
linen, billowy shirt, open in the chest a bit, you

00:47:44.961 --> 00:47:48.060
can see a bit of his chest hair and frilled at the
sleeves.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:53.406
LAURA: The thing is if he was sweaty, then why
would he be wearing long sleeves?

00:47:53.406 --> 00:47:58.416
SAM: To hide all the sweat stains on his
undershirt? I don't know! It's just weird, right?

00:47:58.416 --> 00:48:00.254
Like he's always sweating?

00:48:00.254 --> 00:48:04.950
LAURA: He doesn't look like he's warm, though.
Normally when people are sweaty they're going like

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:06.874
this: (breathing heavily)

00:48:06.874 --> 00:48:07.862
SAM: That's true.

00:48:07.862 --> 00:48:08.937
LAURA: You know?

00:48:08.937 --> 00:48:13.205
SAM: Yes. Anyway, I missed the whole part about
the swamp. What's that mission again?

00:48:13.205 --> 00:48:14.354
What do we have to do?

00:48:14.354 --> 00:48:20.043
LAURA: We go in, we try to find Fabron Keyes and
secure the safehouse in the swamp and there's

00:48:20.043 --> 00:48:22.890
howling there so probably wolves or something.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:26.208
SAM: But wait-- find the safehouse and do what to
it?

00:48:26.208 --> 00:48:28.809
LAURA: Secure it and come back and tell him where
it is--

00:48:28.809 --> 00:48:29.687
SAM: Secure it?

00:48:29.687 --> 00:48:33.129
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's gone dark, right? So either
remove whatever's in there and get it back up and

00:48:33.129 --> 00:48:34.171
running again.

00:48:34.171 --> 00:48:42.117
LIAM: And hey, DM, knowing the Empire, how direct
a route is it from Fabron Keyess area, Berleben to

00:48:42.117 --> 00:48:43.831
Shadycreek Run?

00:48:43.831 --> 00:48:45.469
MATT: You have a map for that.

00:48:45.469 --> 00:48:48.047
MARISHA: There's a map for that.

00:48:48.047 --> 00:48:50.047
TALIESIN: I'll get it.

00:48:50.047 --> 00:48:52.208
SAM: Straight shot.

00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:54.122
LIAM: We have to go around some mountains right?

00:48:54.122 --> 00:48:56.410
MATT: You have to go around the Silberquel Ridge.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:58.986
TALIESIN: Oh, that's up there.

00:48:58.986 --> 00:49:04.583
LAURA: Yeah, so we need to go to Berleben or we
need to go to the swamp, come back here and then go.

00:49:04.583 --> 00:49:05.649
MARISHA: You have a printout?

00:49:05.649 --> 00:49:06.509
LIAM: Yeah.

00:49:06.509 --> 00:49:07.951
MARISHA: I don't have a printout.

00:49:07.951 --> 00:49:12.193
SAM: Yeah, I'm special. Nott has a dot matrix
printer.

00:49:12.193 --> 00:49:15.898
LIAM: (printer noises)

00:49:15.898 --> 00:49:18.052
TRAVIS: That's a pretty good printer.

00:49:18.052 --> 00:49:20.965
LIAM: Berleben. Hupperdook is over here--

00:49:20.965 --> 00:49:22.873
SAM: Oh, yes it is.

00:49:22.873 --> 00:49:24.189
MARISHA: And where are we?

00:49:24.189 --> 00:49:25.720
LIAM: We're down there.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.416
SAM: Jester, do you think people who live in
Hupperdook are called Dookies?

00:49:29.416 --> 00:49:31.686
TALIESIN: Huppers.

00:49:31.686 --> 00:49:33.238
SAM: Or Huppers?

00:49:33.238 --> 00:49:35.661
MARISHA: Oh is it this the Zubenda Swamp? Is that
what it is?

00:49:35.661 --> 00:49:36.635
MATT: Lebenda Swamp.

00:49:36.635 --> 00:49:38.032
LAURA: I think we should call them Dookies.

00:49:38.032 --> 00:49:39.713
SAM: We should call them Dookies, for sure.

00:49:39.713 --> 00:49:44.130
LIAM: And Shadycreek Run was what area again, did
you say?

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:48.293
MATT: Quannah Breach. Northeast of Nogvurot.

00:49:48.293 --> 00:49:50.714
MARISHA: Northeast of what?

00:49:50.714 --> 00:49:56.445
LIAM: Quannah Breach. There it is. We're very
close to Berleben and then it seems like quite a--

00:49:56.445 --> 00:49:58.347
MARISHA: A trek.

00:49:58.347 --> 00:49:59.739
LIAM: Stray, yeah, a trek to--

00:49:59.739 --> 00:50:05.514
MARISHA: We'll have to go here, come back, and
then go again. Also, if we're going to go through

00:50:05.514 --> 00:50:08.128
Berleben anyway, we might as well check in on
Horris.

00:50:08.128 --> 00:50:10.622
TRAVIS: Why?

00:50:10.622 --> 00:50:13.301
MARISHA: To make sure he's, like, <i>alive</i>?

00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:14.742
LAURA: What are we going to do if he's not?

00:50:14.742 --> 00:50:16.639
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:18.488
MARISHA: Not tell anyone.

00:50:18.488 --> 00:50:18.819
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:18.819 --> 00:50:21.303
LAURA: Exactly. Wouldn't it be better if we just
don't know?

00:50:21.303 --> 00:50:22.729
MARISHA: Schrödinger's Horris?

00:50:22.729 --> 00:50:27.905
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've held up our part of the
bargain.

00:50:27.905 --> 00:50:29.198
MARISHA: All right.

00:50:29.198 --> 00:50:38.631
SAM: If I may, Yasha? We're going to be really
close to your old, you know, place where you lived?

00:50:38.631 --> 00:50:41.225
ASHLEY: May I see the map just to make sure?

00:50:41.225 --> 00:50:42.011
SAM: Yes.

00:50:42.011 --> 00:50:43.288
LIAM: Xhorhas is over there.

00:50:43.288 --> 00:50:48.114
SAM: Xhorhas isn't <i>just</i> here. Xhorhas goes all
the way up here.

00:50:48.114 --> 00:50:53.526
ASHLEY: It's pretty big, but I mean, I'm from the
south, anyway.

00:50:53.526 --> 00:50:57.213
MATT: Actually, northward is not Xhorhas,
technically. Just east.

00:50:57.213 --> 00:50:58.534
LAURA: The Greying Wildlands are in the north.

00:50:58.534 --> 00:50:59.784
MATT: Yes, the Greying Wildlands are in the
north.

00:50:59.784 --> 00:51:03.623
SAM: Oh, it's the Greying Wildlands. Oh.

00:51:03.623 --> 00:51:09.010
LIAM: If there is a chance to look in on Horris,
if it is easy, if it doesn't put us out, you know?

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.106
If it's put right in front of us.

00:51:11.106 --> 00:51:18.341
TRAVIS: Yeah, if he's there. I just don't want to
go out of our way looking for him and all of a

00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:20.629
sudden have the guilt of, you know.

00:51:20.629 --> 00:51:24.839
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true. I hate guilt.

00:51:24.839 --> 00:51:29.007
TRAVIS: I mean, don't get me wrong, I like our
efforts here in the city. I think we've done good.

00:51:29.007 --> 00:51:30.608
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:51:30.608 --> 00:51:33.955
TRAVIS: Hard to keep track of parties outside of
our purview.

00:51:33.955 --> 00:51:36.488
LIAM: I am over Zadash.

00:51:36.488 --> 00:51:41.217
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just over it, huh? Plus, it'll give
us time to leave? Maybe things will change by the

00:51:41.217 --> 00:51:48.909
time we come back? Or maybe not. We'll see. Never
know what happens outside.

00:51:48.909 --> 00:51:52.631
MARISHA: So we're going to take them all? Hop on
both of his offers, I think?

00:51:52.631 --> 00:51:56.382
LIAM: Well, quite frankly, I am a little more
comfortable in Quannah Breach anyway.

00:51:56.382 --> 00:51:56.939
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

00:51:56.939 --> 00:51:57.520
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.353
TRAVIS: You're more nomadic?

00:51:58.353 --> 00:51:59.363
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:59.363 --> 00:52:00.726
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:52:00.726 --> 00:52:01.944
MARISHA: Let's do it!

00:52:01.944 --> 00:52:07.104
TRAVIS: Let's do it, yeah. We'll pound our drinks;
keep them away from Beau because

00:52:07.104 --> 00:52:08.163
she'll drink all of them.

00:52:08.163 --> 00:52:12.493
LAURA: I just want to make sure we're here for a
full hour, though. I'm going to drink slowly.

00:52:12.493 --> 00:52:14.514
TALIESIN: I can use a little-- yeah.

00:52:14.514 --> 00:52:15.810
LAURA: I'm going to sip it.

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:16.807
TRAVIS: All right.

00:52:16.807 --> 00:52:20.236
MARISHA: The exhaustion point lasts until you take
a long rest.

00:52:20.236 --> 00:52:23.407
MATT: You don't get an exhaustion point, you just
become stunned for a round.

00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:24.474
LIAM: For a round, it's gone.

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:25.841
MARISHA: For the Haste?

00:52:25.841 --> 00:52:27.264
MATT: Yeah. You're fine.

00:52:27.264 --> 00:52:30.193
LIAM: It's just a pain in the ass in combat, not
in out of combat.

00:52:30.193 --> 00:52:32.678
MARISHA: Oh! Once it wears off you're like--

00:52:32.678 --> 00:52:33.834
LAURA: I thought you get a point of exhaustion
after Haste.

00:52:33.834 --> 00:52:34.442
LIAM: No.

00:52:34.442 --> 00:52:37.870
MATT: No. It just stuns you for one round. Which
in combat is really bad.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.301
MARISHA: Okay.

00:52:39.301 --> 00:52:46.749
TRAVIS: We'll leave Molly and Jester here to nurse
their drinks and their short rests and we'll go

00:52:46.749 --> 00:52:49.312
back up and speak to the Gentleman. No?

00:52:49.312 --> 00:52:52.190
SAM: Yes, of course. I'll come with you, Fjord.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:54.570
TRAVIS: Yeah. Anybody that's not nursing a short
rest.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:56.388
MARISHA: I'm nursing a short rest.

00:52:56.388 --> 00:52:57.535
ASHLEY: I'll go with you.

00:52:57.535 --> 00:52:59.379
LIAM: Yeah, I will as well.

00:52:59.379 --> 00:53:00.601
TALIESIN: Are you going to be able to heal enough
to--

00:53:00.601 --> 00:53:04.228
LAURA: Am I going to be able to heal enough what?

00:53:04.228 --> 00:53:07.474
TALIESIN: For going down river. Or, well, I
suppose it's going to be--

00:53:07.474 --> 00:53:09.468
LAURA: I'll just use the one little spell.

00:53:09.468 --> 00:53:10.945
MARISHA: We'll be all right.

00:53:10.945 --> 00:53:13.488
TALIESIN: Oh, that's, well-- your hit points.

00:53:13.488 --> 00:53:17.952
TRAVIS: Is Sorad the female goliath?

00:53:17.952 --> 00:53:19.738
MATT: Oh. Sorah.

00:53:19.738 --> 00:53:22.891
TRAVIS: Sorah. Is she present in the tavern at the
moment?

00:53:22.891 --> 00:53:27.486
MATT: She is. She's not right by the Gentleman.
She's actually sitting at the table in the-- or

00:53:27.486 --> 00:53:33.616
sitting at the bar 15 feet away from him, but
she's always in his direction. She's perpetually

00:53:33.616 --> 00:53:38.463
hawking his presence and ensuring that nobody
tries anything funny and that she can get there

00:53:38.463 --> 00:53:40.065
quickly if she needs to.

00:53:40.065 --> 00:53:42.287
TRAVIS: Nice. I will approach.

00:53:42.287 --> 00:53:43.403
MARISHA: That's cool.

00:53:43.403 --> 00:53:47.574
MATT: He's in the process of thumbing through a
small book. He's finishing a sip from his goblet

00:53:47.574 --> 00:53:51.820
and watches you push. "Ah. That was quicker than I
anticipated."

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:55.890
TRAVIS: Indeed. We have good news. We have decided
to take you up on your offer.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:57.170
MATT: "Which one?"

00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:58.699
TRAVIS: The Lebenda Swamp.

00:53:58.699 --> 00:54:00.482
LAURA: All of it.

00:54:00.482 --> 00:54:04.890
TRAVIS: <i>The Lebenda Swamp</i> is what we've decided
to take you up on.

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:09.990
MATT: "Very well. And you're not choosing the
Shadycreek Run?"

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:14.377
SAM: Well, will you be reassigning it very quickly
if we don't take it?

00:54:14.377 --> 00:54:17.834
MATT: "I need it to be taken care of so if you
won't do it I'll find somebody else who can."

00:54:17.834 --> 00:54:19.270
LAURA: Hmm-mm.

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.861
MATT: "Time is of the essence here."

00:54:21.861 --> 00:54:23.298
SAM: That's the Lebenda one?

00:54:23.298 --> 00:54:24.921
TRAVIS: Oh. I thought we were doing the beginner's
course?

00:54:24.921 --> 00:54:26.725
LAURA: We're going to do that one and then the
other one! We'll say yes to both.

00:54:26.725 --> 00:54:28.150
TRAVIS: Oh, we're doing both?

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.424
LIAM: Well, we'll hope we can do both. Can we do
both?

00:54:30.424 --> 00:54:36.657
MATT: "You can indeed. If you do both, I'll be
happy to reward you with something nice at the end

00:54:36.657 --> 00:54:39.791
"of it because that's quite a feat."

00:54:39.791 --> 00:54:43.032
TRAVIS: Apparently our ambition has no limit. Both
it is.

00:54:43.032 --> 00:54:46.884
(laughter)

00:54:46.884 --> 00:54:48.611
TRAVIS: Fucking...

00:54:48.611 --> 00:54:54.218
MATT: "Very well. Well, I'm happy to know we're
doing business together once more. I would

00:54:54.218 --> 00:55:01.224
"recommend, if you're heading to Berleben and
Lebenda Swamp to take the Bromkiln Byway. We do

00:55:01.224 --> 00:55:09.492
"have the river, but one, you have quite a number
of individuals that aren't the most quiet, and

00:55:09.492 --> 00:55:19.718
"there are certain things that exist throughout
that 70-ish mile journey you'd be taking underground."

00:55:19.718 --> 00:55:23.698
TRAVIS: By water or also on foot?

00:55:23.698 --> 00:55:29.729
MATT: "Either way, it's still 70 miles to
Berleben. That's a long journey to take

00:55:29.729 --> 00:55:32.814
"underground if you are--"

00:55:32.814 --> 00:55:34.120
LAURA: Not quiet?

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:39.874
MATT: "Not quiet and inconspicuous. Our smuggling
run usually goes in groups of two to three at most

00:55:39.874 --> 00:55:41.630
"to keep it quick and unseen."

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:46.383
LIAM: When you say "underground," are you speaking
metaphorically, or do you literally have a way

00:55:46.383 --> 00:55:47.881
underground to get there?

00:55:47.881 --> 00:55:48.970
MATT: "You've already been there."

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:50.204
LIAM: The river goes that far?

00:55:50.204 --> 00:55:50.857
MATT: "Yes."

00:55:50.857 --> 00:55:52.211
LAURA: The passage that we were in.

00:55:52.211 --> 00:55:55.463
LIAM: Yeah, we took that for an hour, not 70
miles.

00:55:55.463 --> 00:56:01.868
MATT: "Which is why I'm saying, if you choose to
otherwise, that's up to you, but I would recommend

00:56:01.872 --> 00:56:11.208
"taking above ground on the Bromkiln Byway. It's a
well-carried road. It sees a lot of foot traffic,

00:56:11.248 --> 00:56:15.320
"shouldn't be that dangerous, and it's nearly a
straight shot to the swamp."

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:22.845
SAM: It sounds like it's going to be no sweat.
We'll stay high and dry.

00:56:22.845 --> 00:56:25.731
LIAM: What would we have to be wary of in the
river?

00:56:25.731 --> 00:56:29.168
MATT: "Whatever decides to take up residence down
there."

00:56:29.168 --> 00:56:31.146
TRAVIS: Do we still have the cart, and the two
horses?

00:56:31.146 --> 00:56:33.902
TALIESIN: Of course we have the cart and the two
horses, yeah. We have the cart, at least.

00:56:33.902 --> 00:56:36.425
MATT: You have five horses, if I recall.

00:56:36.925 --> 00:56:38.940
TALIESIN: We have horses. Horses for days.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:42.888
SAM: Crapper, Shitter, W.C., Toilet, John.

00:56:42.888 --> 00:56:44.595
MARISHA: I wrote them down.

00:56:44.595 --> 00:56:50.325
TRAVIS: We're unfortunately a little short on
transportation. We could use a few horses.

00:56:50.325 --> 00:56:55.969
MATT: "Seeing as how you're accepting both, that
would put you in the business of acquiring the

00:56:55.969 --> 00:57:08.133
"advance from both, so that would be-- Dweez!
Please retrieve the advances. 750." There's a

00:57:08.133 --> 00:57:15.335
brief break before you hear the familiar
chuckling, and three large sacks are put up onto

00:57:15.335 --> 00:57:20.214
the table. "750 gold. The advances for both
missions."

00:57:20.214 --> 00:57:29.940
TRAVIS: Outstanding. Jester did have an excellent
question. We'll need certain remedies, especially

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.496
near the water. Anything that you can provide that
might put us in an advantageous position would be

00:57:34.496 --> 00:57:37.265
most appreciated.

00:57:37.265 --> 00:57:43.823
MATT: "Dweez, gather what we can spare from the
supply cabinet, please." He wanders off for a

00:57:43.823 --> 00:57:51.716
moment, and comes back with two small,
over-the-shoulder satchels. He sets them on the

00:57:51.716 --> 00:57:57.891
table. (chuckling) Opens the little lids for them
and pushes them forward. You watch as one of them

00:57:57.891 --> 00:58:05.167
falls forward and clattering out a few inches or
so, some vials in there. "The one on the right

00:58:05.167 --> 00:58:11.959
"should be able to tend to any wounds you sustain
along the journey. The one on the left can aid

00:58:11.959 --> 00:58:15.680
"you, should you find yourself pricked with some
terrible disease."

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.912
LAURA: Poison and healing, got it.

00:58:17.912 --> 00:58:22.532
MATT: "Disease, not poison. Unfortunately, we have
not that."

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:25.065
SAM: One of each.

00:58:25.065 --> 00:58:37.648
MATT: Two vials in one of healing. They're both of
greater healing. The other one is cure disease.

00:58:37.648 --> 00:58:42.360
LIAM: Paper and ink?

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.743
MATT: "We can provide you with paper and ink,
should you be so interested. Dweez?"

00:58:46.743 --> 00:58:50.091
MARISHA: Didn't you buy a fuckton of paper and
ink? You've used it all?

00:58:50.091 --> 00:58:51.237
LIAM: I've used it.

00:58:51.237 --> 00:58:56.902
TRAVIS: Do you know what is also as valuable as
resources, is knowledge. In this swamp area, are

00:58:56.902 --> 00:59:03.349
there any particular hazards that we should keep
an eye out for that your men have seen repetitively?

00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:11.650
MATT: "None that I've cared to remember. That
would be more of a question to my ally there, if

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:16.484
"you don't mind. Speak with Febron. He is very
familiar with the area and can give you the

00:59:16.484 --> 00:59:18.315
"information you seek."

00:59:18.315 --> 00:59:23.501
TRAVIS: I wouldn't presume to be as lucky as to
have Louis have tried this mission before and

00:59:23.501 --> 00:59:26.067
fucked it up as well, has he?

00:59:26.067 --> 00:59:31.651
MATT: "No, I would not ensure such a mission to
him." He glances past you, in the far corner you

00:59:31.651 --> 00:59:38.918
can see him now leaning over the bar, two full
cups in, starting to get a little dazed on the stool.

00:59:38.918 --> 00:59:41.857
TRAVIS: Hey, Louis! Fuck you!

00:59:41.857 --> 00:59:44.303
MATT: His hand does this.

00:59:44.303 --> 00:59:45.937
TRAVIS: Yep, he's a winner.

00:59:45.937 --> 00:59:49.040
LAURA: You will get 107 gold.

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:55.764
MATT: "Anything else you require?"

00:59:55.764 --> 00:59:59.455
SAM: No. This has really whet our appetite.

00:59:59.455 --> 01:00:01.701
TRAVIS: Swamp pun?

01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:02.942
LIAM: Sure.

01:00:02.942 --> 01:00:11.247
SAM: I just can't stop staring at his face, it's
soaking wet! Sorry.

01:00:11.247 --> 01:00:17.730
MATT: "Anyway, if our business is complete. I
appreciate your patronage, I look forward to our

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:22.553
"continued partnership, and I wish you all the
luck."

01:00:22.553 --> 01:00:24.065
LAURA: Thank you.

01:00:24.065 --> 01:00:25.317
MATT: "Thank you."

01:00:25.317 --> 01:00:27.378
SAM: Don't sweat the small stuff.

01:00:27.378 --> 01:00:30.360
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

01:00:30.911 --> 01:00:36.149
LIAM: Caleb hangs back all by himself and says:
(stuttering) Paper and ink?

01:00:36.826 --> 01:00:42.487
MATT: Dweez comes up from behind a moment later
with a stack of regular parchment and ink. He

01:00:42.487 --> 01:00:49.956
hands it over. It does not look like it would be
the necessary enchanted or prepared inks that you

01:00:49.956 --> 01:00:53.736
could use to scribe spells per se, but it's
parchment and ink.

01:00:53.736 --> 01:00:57.301
LIAM: <i>Ja, danke.</i> Okay.

01:00:57.301 --> 01:01:01.383
TRAVIS: This is very exciting, two missions at
once.

01:01:01.383 --> 01:01:05.553
LAURA: Well one and then-- Oh, I run back to The
Gentleman. Should we come back here after the

01:01:05.553 --> 01:01:09.413
first part or should we continue on and take care
of them both and then come tell you?

01:01:09.413 --> 01:01:13.241
MATT: "That's up to you, I can't pay you unless
you come back, but if you complete them both, and

01:01:13.241 --> 01:01:19.199
"do so in ample time, I'll be happy to pay you when
you return from both. Just send word, if you

01:01:19.199 --> 01:01:21.624
"could, upon clearing our safehouse."

01:01:21.624 --> 01:01:23.627
LAURA: That way you know we did it timely and we
can get that bonus part.

01:01:23.627 --> 01:01:24.301
MATT: "Precisely."

01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:25.525
LAURA: Okay.

01:01:25.525 --> 01:01:33.474
MATT: "All right. Thank you very much. Good
luck."

01:01:33.474 --> 01:01:38.718
SAM: Just going to leave a handkerchief. Just in
case.

01:01:38.718 --> 01:01:45.494
MATT: He just glares at you. Glowering at Nott as
you all step away from his corner of the chamber.

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:51.817
TRAVIS: Well, it's still a really good time in the
day we should go ahead and make preparations. Make

01:01:51.817 --> 01:01:53.256
our way back up?

01:01:53.256 --> 01:01:55.798
TALIESIN: We're already ready to leave at a
moment's notice.

01:01:55.798 --> 01:01:57.520
LAURA: Yeah, we already packed our rooms up.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.419
SAM: There's nothing at Pumat's anymore.

01:01:59.419 --> 01:02:01.257
LAURA: No more Pumat's.

01:02:01.257 --> 01:02:07.745
MATT: You've almost cleared out-- Between you and
other patrons in the recent weeks, they've cleared

01:02:07.745 --> 01:02:11.394
him out. It's not an endless emporium.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:15.663
TRAVIS: As we pass that big ogre on the way out I
say: Kutha, keep it real, all right?

01:02:15.663 --> 01:02:22.629
MATT: As you do that, he turns around and a hand
slaps onto your shoulder, the finger and thumb of

01:02:22.629 --> 01:02:27.072
it go from the front of your chest to your small
back as it grapples you and spins you around and

01:02:27.072 --> 01:02:32.403
goes (grunts) and then releases you.

01:02:32.403 --> 01:02:41.472
TRAVIS: That's a big hand.

01:02:41.472 --> 01:02:47.053
LAURA: As I leave, I flick the Wand of Smiles at
him again.

01:02:47.053 --> 01:02:49.378
TRAVIS: Fucking Kutha can't catch a break.

01:02:51.131 --> 01:02:51.885
MATT: Four.

01:02:51.885 --> 01:02:56.149
(laughter)

01:02:56.149 --> 01:03:03.185
MATT: As he peels his large mitt off of Fjord's
body and grunts, he turns to the rest of the chamber.

01:03:03.185 --> 01:03:06.264
SAM: Here it is.

01:03:06.264 --> 01:03:19.076
(laughter and pained yelling)

01:03:19.076 --> 01:03:22.665
MATT: He starts pulling at his jaw. It's almost
like getting a charlie horse where you can't stop

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:26.550
the muscles and he tries to stop it.

01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:29.235
ASHLEY: The Wand of Smiles.

01:03:29.235 --> 01:03:31.129
LAURA: Now I feel guilty.

01:03:31.129 --> 01:03:39.218
MATT: Eh, he probably deserved it. You guys ascend
the stairs back into the main front of The Evening

01:03:39.218 --> 01:03:44.232
Nip, and the rest of the afternoon is yours. What
would you like to do?

01:03:44.232 --> 01:03:47.418
TRAVIS: I mean, we can head over to the cart and
horses.

01:03:47.418 --> 01:03:50.045
ASHLEY: Should we just get that started, and we'll
go?

01:03:50.045 --> 01:03:53.641
LIAM: I am going to run over to Pumat's to buy
some paper and ink.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.317
TRAVIS: More?

01:03:55.317 --> 01:03:56.321
LIAM: I'm gone.

01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:57.479
MATT: Okay, Caleb is just--

01:03:57.479 --> 01:04:01.987
MARISHA: I join Caleb, because I went pee last
time when you guys went to go to Pumat's.

01:04:01.987 --> 01:04:03.878
TRAVIS: Okay, there's nothing there.

01:04:03.878 --> 01:04:05.710
LAURA: It's cleared out.

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:07.387
MATT: Well, there's some things.

01:04:07.387 --> 01:04:08.796
TRAVIS: But you can finally kill him if you want
to.

01:04:08.796 --> 01:04:11.632
(laughter)

01:04:11.632 --> 01:04:13.624
MARISHA: Ah, shit there are four more!

01:04:13.624 --> 01:04:15.554
MATT: Massacre in downtown Zadash this afternoon.

01:04:15.554 --> 01:04:18.086
TRAVIS: As you run off I say: Meet us at the cart
and horses.

01:04:18.086 --> 01:04:20.046
MARISHA: All right. Super fast.

01:04:20.046 --> 01:04:23.268
MATT: As you guys charge over to the Pentamarket,
you make your way to the exterior of The

01:04:23.268 --> 01:04:32.689
Invulnerable Vagrant. Stepping inside, there is a
rather chill, customer-less interior, as two of

01:04:32.689 --> 01:04:39.545
the regular Pumats sit at the front. As you step
into the chamber, "Oh you're back so soon. I

01:04:39.545 --> 01:04:44.544
"figured you had completed all your intended means
of purchasing."

01:04:44.544 --> 01:04:48.736
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> This is a quick stop, I don't want to
take up too much of your time and we don't have

01:04:48.736 --> 01:04:54.720
much. We have a busy day planned. I was wondering
if you had, perhaps, maybe 100 gold's worth more

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.404
of that good paper and ink that you have supplied
me with already.

01:04:58.404 --> 01:05:03.835
MATT: "I can go ahead and look. You're starting to
really diminish our stockpile."

01:05:03.835 --> 01:05:14.217
LIAM: Oh, <i>ja</i>, I am sorry. Also, I am in need of
maybe 20-30 gold's worth of fine incense, if you

01:05:14.217 --> 01:05:15.155
have that as well.

01:05:15.155 --> 01:05:18.456
MATT: "That I'm pretty sure we can supply, is that
right? You checking the back?

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:24.301
"I know it was there yesterday, we got plenty
of incense. Don't worry, we got you covered." He

01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:31.390
comes back in with two sacks of very strong,
pungent smelling, incense that, when burning, has

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:38.630
a more pleasant scent. These have been treated
specifically for rituals and various arcane means.

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:47.079
You get 30 gold worth of incense at your disposal,
and the 100 gold worth of enchanted inks and

01:05:47.079 --> 01:05:53.388
scribing materials and paper that you can utilize
to make those notes and transition it into a spellbook.

01:05:53.388 --> 01:05:56.444
LIAM: Is there anything that you wanted to
purchase while we are here?

01:05:56.444 --> 01:06:01.551
MARISHA: A little birdy told me there might be
bracers here?

01:06:01.551 --> 01:06:08.255
MATT: "That's one of the few items we have left.
Yeah. I apologize, it's a little embarrassing,

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:11.835
"we've all been talking about how it's really
embarrassing.

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:15.598
"It's hard to have a shop without inventory."

01:06:15.598 --> 01:06:16.505
MARISHA: Bracers?

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:23.705
MATT: "Oh, yeah. Right over here." Goes and pulls
one of the boxes from the shelves. It has a glass

01:06:23.705 --> 01:06:30.249
top and he presents it to you. There's a velvet
interior with two little alcoves inside where

01:06:30.249 --> 01:06:37.852
these very beautiful, silver bracers with
scrolling and runic sigils carved into it across

01:06:37.852 --> 01:06:46.041
the band are present, "These would make a better
defensive capability for someone who does not

01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:49.525
"themselves partake in the use of armor."

01:06:49.525 --> 01:06:53.092
MARISHA: Oh. I don't partake in the use of armor.

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:57.090
MATT: "Well, that sounds like it's meant to be."

01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:58.503
MARISHA: Uh-huh. How much?

01:06:58.503 --> 01:06:59.833
MATT: "1200 gold pieces."

01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:05.971
MARISHA: Holy shit, Pumat! The fuck?!

01:07:05.971 --> 01:07:08.575
MATT: "What?"

01:07:08.575 --> 01:07:11.307
MARISHA: I'll come back when I'm fucking rich,
aight?

01:07:11.307 --> 01:07:13.193
MATT: "Okay, they'll be here waiting for you."

01:07:13.193 --> 01:07:14.222
MARISHA: All right.

01:07:14.222 --> 01:07:15.992
LIAM: Holy shit, Pumats.

01:07:15.992 --> 01:07:17.398
MARISHA: Holy shit, Pumats.

01:07:17.398 --> 01:07:20.580
MATT: "Thank you." "Thank you." "Thank you."
"Thank you."

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.033
MARISHA: I don't have fucking 1200 gold.

01:07:22.033 --> 01:07:22.803
TRAVIS: I do.

01:07:22.803 --> 01:07:28.684
MARISHA: How do you have 1200 gold?

01:07:28.996 --> 01:07:30.584
LIAM: You don't want to know how much I have.

01:07:30.584 --> 01:07:36.940
MATT: "I apologize, didn't mean to send you into
an existential financial crisis. But it's a really

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.731
"powerful enchantment and--"

01:07:38.731 --> 01:07:41.443
MARISHA: I'm always in an existential crisis. I'm
going to go now.

01:07:41.443 --> 01:07:47.564
MATT: "Fair enough. Okay well, Pumat Prime worked
very hard on those. When you come back to get them

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:52.412
"I think you'll be very happy with amount that
you've spent to keep yourself alive."

01:07:52.412 --> 01:07:56.542
LIAM: We are very appreciative and I don't know if
you have already, but you should look into some

01:07:56.542 --> 01:08:00.253
sort of membership card or frequent customer
points.

01:08:00.253 --> 01:08:02.065
MARISHA: Stamp punch.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.343
MATT: "I'll go ahead and bring it up with the big
guy himself."

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:07.578
MARISHA: Ten visits.

01:08:07.578 --> 01:08:09.763
TALIESIN: Nine potions, the tenth one's free.

01:08:09.763 --> 01:08:11.016
MATT: "Fantastic."

01:08:11.016 --> 01:08:16.312
LIAM: Thousand gold's worth of paper and the 11th
ream is free. We'll go now.

01:08:16.312 --> 01:08:18.571
MATT: "Yeah. Okay, thank you."

01:08:18.571 --> 01:08:23.278
MARISHA: We go. Very quickly. Bolt over to the
cart.

01:08:23.278 --> 01:08:24.298
MATT: You guys hastily make your way to the cart.

01:08:24.298 --> 01:08:30.794
LIAM: You know that little boost you had back
there in your fist fight with the blue one? You're welcome.

01:08:30.794 --> 01:08:34.912
MARISHA: Did you fucking slip something into my
drink, Caleb? What the fuck, man?

01:08:34.912 --> 01:08:38.798
LIAM: I cast-- That was arc-- That was a spell.

01:08:38.798 --> 01:08:44.725
MARISHA: Oh. Dude, that shit was awesome. Yeah, I
was into it.

01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:47.882
LIAM: You scratch my back, I will scratch yours.

01:08:47.882 --> 01:08:49.764
MARISHA: All right.

01:08:54.594 --> 01:08:56.750
LIAM: The others are on a mission, let's go.

01:08:57.107 --> 01:09:01.027
MATT: The rest of you guys gather the carts and
the horses you have at your disposal. Prepared

01:09:01.027 --> 01:09:09.027
yourself for exit from the town. Eventually Caleb
and Beauregard catch up to the rest of you. What

01:09:09.027 --> 01:09:10.480
would you like to do?

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.670
TRAVIS: Who's riding on the cart first?

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.683
ASHLEY: I don't need to. I'd feel weird.

01:09:16.683 --> 01:09:18.045
SAM: Are you just going to walk?

01:09:18.045 --> 01:09:19.458
LAURA: We have horses, you can ride a horse.

01:09:19.458 --> 01:09:20.546
ASHLEY: Well yeah, I'll ride a horse.

01:09:20.546 --> 01:09:25.319
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got like five horses and a cart.
Two horses pulling the cart? Or two and three solos?

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:27.604
MARISHA: Who is good to be lookout while the
others?

01:09:27.604 --> 01:09:32.496
SAM: Do four horses pulling the cart and two
solo?

01:09:32.496 --> 01:09:34.628
LAURA: Two horses pulling the cart.

01:09:34.628 --> 01:09:35.772
TRAVIS: How many horses do we have?

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:37.118
SAM: Six. We have six horses.

01:09:37.118 --> 01:09:37.926
LAURA: Five.

01:09:37.926 --> 01:09:38.616
SAM: We have six horses.

01:09:38.616 --> 01:09:39.672
LAURA: We have six horses?!

01:09:39.672 --> 01:09:45.548
SAM: Yes. Only five of them have names. We never
came up with a name for the sixth horse.

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:46.923
LAURA: I'll drive the cart.

01:09:46.923 --> 01:09:49.402
LIAM: Loaf. How about Loaf?

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:54.424
SAM: Loaf is a good name. We have: WC, Lou, John,
Crapper, Toilet, and Loaf.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:10:01.771
TRAVIS: Okay. Two horses pulling the cart, and
four solos?

01:10:01.771 --> 01:10:03.450
MARISHA: Jester said she's riding in the cart.

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:06.032
LAURA: I'll drive the cart.

01:10:06.032 --> 01:10:07.689
TRAVIS: Who else wants to be on the cart?

01:10:07.689 --> 01:10:08.567
LIAM: I want to be on the cart.

01:10:08.567 --> 01:10:09.647
SAM: I want it as well.

01:10:09.647 --> 01:10:10.505
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:10:10.505 --> 01:10:11.861
TALIESIN: I'll take Water-Closet.

01:10:11.861 --> 01:10:12.669
TRAVIS: What?

01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:13.621
MARISHA: I'll take Loaf.

01:10:13.621 --> 01:10:14.406
TALIESIN: W.C.

01:10:14.406 --> 01:10:15.373
SAM: That's the name of the horse.

01:10:15.373 --> 01:10:18.169
TRAVIS: That's right, sorry. I'll take a horse as
well.

01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:21.832
ASHLEY: I'll take a horse as well, because you
guys are all in the cart, yeah?

01:10:21.832 --> 01:10:27.636
LIAM: Yasha, will you hold this for me? I put
Frumpkin on her shoulder and start transcribing.

01:10:27.636 --> 01:10:29.713
ASHLEY: (sneezes)

01:10:29.713 --> 01:10:30.499
MARISHA: Oh god!

01:10:30.499 --> 01:10:31.919
SAM: Oh no!

01:10:31.919 --> 01:10:38.523
TRAVIS: Keep that demon cat away from me. El gato
es el diablo, all right?

01:10:38.523 --> 01:10:43.954
ASHLEY: I give him a pet. But is it real? I don't
understand because sometimes it just poofs, you know?

01:10:43.954 --> 01:10:46.792
LIAM: It is a real cat.

01:10:46.792 --> 01:10:50.958
ASHLEY: I am not trying to make you upset or
anything, just sometimes it goes away then it

01:10:50.958 --> 01:10:53.988
comes back. I'm confused.

01:10:53.988 --> 01:10:59.375
LIAM: Frumpkin can be here or Frumpkin can be
there, and right now he is here.

01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:00.994
ASHLEY: Can I touch him?

01:11:00.994 --> 01:11:05.014
LIAM: He would like you to touch him, yeah. But
respectfully.

01:11:05.014 --> 01:11:10.667
LAURA: When someone kicks him and he poofs, does
he automatically go to the other place or does he

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:13.459
die for a little bit and come back?

01:11:13.459 --> 01:11:18.460
LIAM: No, I think it's pretty instantaneous and
honestly I am so glad to have him, but I think

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:25.670
that it is probably nicer on the other side. Does
your mother ever read stories about the Feywild

01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:30.772
and sprites and blumpkins? That's not the word.

01:11:30.772 --> 01:11:35.220
LAURA: My mother never did, but the Traveler told
me lots of stories.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.123
LIAM: Of the Feywild?

01:11:37.123 --> 01:11:39.564
LAURA: Of everywhere.

01:11:39.564 --> 01:11:43.406
TRAVIS: The Feywild? Is it like another city?

01:11:43.406 --> 01:11:50.998
LIAM: It's another plane of existence that is a
mirror slightly off of our own. With us, but apart

01:11:50.998 --> 01:11:52.112
from us at all times.

01:11:52.112 --> 01:11:56.925
LAURA: There's faeries, and that is how the
unicorns get over here.

01:11:56.925 --> 01:12:01.254
TRAVIS: One thing at a time.

01:12:01.254 --> 01:12:05.395
ASHLEY: He's making a very strange noise right
now.

01:12:05.395 --> 01:12:06.433
TRAVIS: What's it sound like?

01:12:06.433 --> 01:12:09.246
ASHLEY: (purring)

01:12:09.246 --> 01:12:11.174
LIAM: That means he likes you.

01:12:11.174 --> 01:12:14.010
SAM: Did you not have cat where you grew up?

01:12:14.534 --> 01:12:20.331
ASHLEY: No, I have heard of cats, but Frumpkin
is one of the first.

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:22.472
SAM: Did they have dogs?

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:24.409
TRAVIS: Only rats that they ate.

01:12:24.409 --> 01:12:26.570
ASHLEY: That's true, we have lots of rats. We have
many creatures.

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:27.507
LAURA: Do you have wolves?

01:12:27.507 --> 01:12:28.779
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:12:28.779 --> 01:12:31.517
MARISHA: What did you keep as pets?

01:12:31.517 --> 01:12:33.543
ASHLEY: We didn't really have any.

01:12:33.543 --> 01:12:34.918
MARISHA: You didn't have any pets?

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:35.872
ASHLEY: No.

01:12:35.872 --> 01:12:37.007
MARISHA: Oh.

01:12:37.007 --> 01:12:39.071
ASHLEY: But I like him.

01:12:39.071 --> 01:12:42.469
LIAM: I tell Frumpkin to nestle in and he starts
doing that thing where they claw their way in when

01:12:42.469 --> 01:12:46.237
they're getting cozy. It hurts, but it's also
lovable at the same time.

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:47.647
MARISHA: Making biscuits!

01:12:47.647 --> 01:12:50.104
MATT: Roll for kitty biscuits.

01:12:50.104 --> 01:12:55.345
TRAVIS: Pure death. Fucking anaphylactic shock.

01:12:55.345 --> 01:12:59.376
LIAM: Then I stop talking to everybody and I start
transcribing things.

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:05.911
TRAVIS: I guess I'll take the lead and we'll make
our way out the city. Heading northeast, right?

01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:07.094
TALIESIN: North.

01:13:07.094 --> 01:13:09.251
MARISHA and LAURA: To the Swamp!

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:11.385
TRAVIS: To the Bronchial Byway.

01:13:11.385 --> 01:13:18.959
MATT: The Bromkiln, yeah. The Bronchial Byway, the
life breath of the land.

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:21.133
MARISHA: We ruin everything Matt creates.

01:13:21.133 --> 01:13:29.766
LIAM: Sometimes you do make them bulletproof and
we get mad. But most of the time, we can crack the code.

01:13:29.766 --> 01:13:35.495
MATT: I enjoy it, and I'm sure every Dungeon
Master out there who watches knows exactly how I

01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:43.722
feel when it happens. You gather your things up
into the cart, the horses begin to push off and

01:13:43.722 --> 01:13:49.272
you make your way through the city streets of
Zadash to the Northern Wall. You can still see

01:13:49.272 --> 01:13:56.525
some of the townsfolk coming out and going about
their day, but the general air of tension and

01:13:56.525 --> 01:14:04.464
nervousness still holds court throughout the
city's streets. There are clusters of crownsguard.

01:14:04.464 --> 01:14:12.305
They're escorting the Righteous Brand to the
eastern side. You make your way to the northern

01:14:12.335 --> 01:14:16.290
side of the city where the Signet Wall district
begins where you have the large fortresses, where

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:22.087
the military stays, and the barracks that surround
that region. To the large gate that exits the

01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:28.400
building out into the rest of the Marrow
Valley. As you make it through the large, raised

01:14:28.493 --> 01:14:33.771
portcullis, along with a few other folks that are
in the process of making their own journey into

01:14:33.771 --> 01:14:39.825
the north or to the west or to the east, you step
out onto the dirt road, into the green blowing

01:14:39.825 --> 01:14:46.995
fields, the cold breeze that's blowing beneath the
graying skies of Wildemount and you push off.

01:14:46.995 --> 01:14:52.589
Being here for a while, it seems strange, but also
welcoming to be back on the open road for a

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:58.711
moment. You glance around and take a deep breath
as that clean post-rain air still seems to linger

01:14:58.711 --> 01:15:05.443
in the vicinity. As you make a sweep on the
horizon, with the rolling hills and patches of

01:15:05.443 --> 01:15:10.750
trees, catch your vision off to the far east on
the outside of the Signet Wall district, you see

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:20.333
hundreds if not thousands of soldiers, all
gathered and making their way east in small

01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:28.800
troops. Here the mainstay source, the bulk of
military power in the center of the Empire makes

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:39.275
its way to war. You see horses, siege engines, and
large ballista on wheels all being carried and

01:15:39.275 --> 01:15:47.977
prepared for the journey to the borders of Xhorhas
and beyond. With that, you pick up and continue

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:56.960
northward, making your way long the Amber Road,
towards to where the Bromkiln Byway carves off to

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:02.941
your destination. First, I want to ask you guys:
what pace are you travelling at? You can go slow

01:16:02.941 --> 01:16:09.481
pace if you try to be super stealthy. Normal pace
is fine. Fast pace you go quickly, but you

01:16:09.481 --> 01:16:13.668
threaten exhaustion if you continue to push that
way.

01:16:13.668 --> 01:16:18.609
TRAVIS: I think we'll go at a regular pace until
we get to the Bromkiln Byway. At the Amber Road,

01:16:18.609 --> 01:16:21.886
we should be all right.

01:16:21.886 --> 01:16:27.163
MATT: You're looking at about a 75-mile journey.
With the cart and the horses, you're looking at

01:16:27.163 --> 01:16:31.447
about 30 miles a day at a normal pace. You're
probably looking at two nights' stay on the road

01:16:31.447 --> 01:16:32.816
before you reach your destination.

01:16:32.816 --> 01:16:35.470
LAURA and MARISHA: Okay.

01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:44.104
MATT: You guys push forward and watch as, behind
you, the large, looming walls and towers and

01:16:44.104 --> 01:16:54.377
buildings of Zadash that had been your home for
weeks disappear slowly behind you. Once again,

01:16:54.377 --> 01:17:03.720
you're embraced by the wilds and open landscapes
of the valley. You take a moment to reflect upon

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:11.894
the insanity and craziness of the urban atmosphere
and the peace, as well as the unknown, that comes

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:25.943
with traversing such an open plain. I'd say you
have maybe a few hours before the sun sets. Right

01:17:25.943 --> 01:17:32.555
as you hit the intersection between the Amber Road
and the Bromkiln Byway, the sun has set. The sky

01:17:32.555 --> 01:17:40.076
is dark; the clouds prevent starlight from coming
through, and what moonlight would be visible is

01:17:40.076 --> 01:17:45.450
choked, giving you only the faint glimmer of the
moon's location behind the cloud cover.

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:47.316
What would you like to do?

01:17:47.316 --> 01:17:50.100
SAM: It's nighttime now?

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.278
MATT: It is.

01:17:51.278 --> 01:17:54.318
LAURA: I bet someone's going to try to jump out at
us.

01:17:54.318 --> 01:17:57.127
SAM: We should not let them do that.

01:17:57.127 --> 01:17:59.209
LAURA: They do that to people that are on the open
road.

01:17:59.209 --> 01:18:03.462
SAM: Why would you tell me that? Now I'm very
scared!

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:13.679
TRAVIS: Are there any tree clusters or rock
clusters or boulders or anything that provides shelter?

01:18:13.679 --> 01:18:18.053
MATT: At your current location? Make a perception
check with disadvantage because it is nighttime.

01:18:18.053 --> 01:18:19.415
TRAVIS: I'm the wrong person to be doing this.

01:18:19.415 --> 01:18:21.376
TALIESIN: I was going to say I was hoping to find
the same thing.

01:18:21.376 --> 01:18:22.929
MARISHA: I put on the goggles.

01:18:22.929 --> 01:18:25.297
MATT: Then you can both make individual rolls, or
one of you can aid the other.

01:18:25.297 --> 01:18:27.192
TRAVIS: I'll aid you.

01:18:27.192 --> 01:18:29.398
MATT: You take your advantage on your roll.

01:18:29.761 --> 01:18:33.488
TALIESIN: Nope. That was a two with advantage.

01:18:33.488 --> 01:18:36.467
MARISHA: What did you roll, a one and a two?

01:18:36.467 --> 01:18:38.524
TALIESIN: A two and a one.

01:18:38.524 --> 01:18:40.273
LAURA: That's really shit.

01:18:40.273 --> 01:18:43.951
MATT: As the night has fallen and you spend the
better part of the next hour trying to look for

01:18:43.951 --> 01:18:53.982
any physical representation of safety or cover, it
is just open rolling hills and field. There might

01:18:53.982 --> 01:18:59.812
be places where you could stay low and perhaps
keep relatively safe, but nothing that sticks out

01:18:59.812 --> 01:19:03.487
to you, unfortunately. What do you plan to do?

01:19:03.487 --> 01:19:07.446
LAURA: We should probably pull over or something
and look around and see.

01:19:07.446 --> 01:19:11.792
TRAVIS: Just off the road is fine. At this point,
I'd like to see the road as well. That way we can

01:19:11.792 --> 01:19:14.296
see anyone coming.

01:19:14.296 --> 01:19:18.811
MARISHA: Can I go ahead and light a torch, see if
I can start a fire? Gather some wood?

01:19:18.811 --> 01:19:21.182
MATT: Which is a good thing because it gets cold
at night out here.

01:19:21.182 --> 01:19:23.290
SAM: Did we bring any warm clothes?

01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:24.637
LIAM: We're going north.

01:19:24.637 --> 01:19:26.476
SAM: We're the worst.

01:19:26.476 --> 01:19:31.639
MATT: It'll only get colder the further north you
go. Even at night here-- most mornings in

01:19:31.639 --> 01:19:40.122
Wildemount, at least this area of Wildemount, all
the grass is frosted, the windows are frosted. Few

01:19:40.122 --> 01:19:45.975
moisture survives the evening without some sort of
frozen state. As the temperature begins to plummet

01:19:45.975 --> 01:19:50.621
continuously after sunset, you begin to find a
place to set up camp for the evening. Beau takes

01:19:50.621 --> 01:19:59.135
the torch, ignites it, and sets a small fire. You
begin to set up a small circle and maintain warmth

01:19:59.135 --> 01:20:03.829
by taking what bits of-- and it's very sparse
vegetation. If you want to check for anything to

01:20:03.829 --> 01:20:07.462
keep the fire going, roll a survival check.

01:20:09.613 --> 01:20:12.442
MARISHA: Not great, ten.

01:20:12.442 --> 01:20:16.678
MATT: You manage to get some brush gathered,
you're probably not going to be able to keep the

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:17.832
fire going all night.

01:20:17.832 --> 01:20:22.272
LIAM: I donate the paper that The Gentleman gave
me.

01:20:22.272 --> 01:20:24.546
LAURA: That's a fast burn, that's not going to
last very long.

01:20:24.546 --> 01:20:25.875
TRAVIS: I have a torch as well.

01:20:25.875 --> 01:20:27.457
TALIESIN: I've got a torch.

01:20:27.457 --> 01:20:31.834
MATT: Let's say if you throw in three torches,
that'll keep a modicum of the flame going through

01:20:31.834 --> 01:20:35.995
the night. Not the most heat, but it'll be enough
to prevent you from dealing with the biting cold

01:20:35.995 --> 01:20:37.796
as you rest through the night.

01:20:37.796 --> 01:20:39.469
TRAVIS: I'll throw in two, Molly.

01:20:39.469 --> 01:20:45.913
LAURA: We could camp on top of the cart because we
won't be on the ground, it's warmer on there.

01:20:45.913 --> 01:20:49.613
MARISHA: That's true, park the cart next to the
fire.

01:20:49.613 --> 01:20:52.049
MATT: Who's taking watch?

01:20:52.049 --> 01:20:55.958
LIAM: I'm taking this silver thread and making a
20-foot cube around the cart.

01:20:55.958 --> 01:20:57.136
TRAVIS: I'll take first watch.

01:20:57.136 --> 01:21:02.341
LAURA: I'll take first watch with him.

01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:07.995
MATT: As the rest of you manage to find yourself
asleep for the evening, Jester and Fjord take the

01:21:07.995 --> 01:21:12.076
first watch. Do you wish to make a perception
check?

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:13.085
LAURA: Yeah.

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:15.433
MATT: Which one of you is helming?

01:21:15.433 --> 01:21:17.561
TRAVIS: My perception's shit. How's yours?

01:21:17.561 --> 01:21:20.402
LAURA: It's not awesome, but it's not horrible.

01:21:20.402 --> 01:21:22.721
TALIESIN: For this group, that's pretty good.

01:21:22.721 --> 01:21:24.679
TRAVIS: I'll aid you, how about that?

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:26.063
LAURA: I'm helm.

01:21:26.063 --> 01:21:28.059
MATT: Advantage.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:42.715
LAURA: Oh, goddamn it. 13.

01:21:42.715 --> 01:21:48.660
MATT: Keeping an eye out there, other than a
couple bits of whistling wind that blow through in

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:55.726
segments, you don't pick up anything shifty, and
your watch comes to a close without issue.

01:21:55.726 --> 01:21:57.754
LAURA: That was an easy watch, then!

01:21:57.754 --> 01:21:59.552
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:21:59.552 --> 01:22:00.486
MATT: Next watch?

01:22:00.486 --> 01:22:01.569
ASHLEY: I'll take second watch.

01:22:01.569 --> 01:22:02.719
MARISHA: I'll take second watch as well.

01:22:02.719 --> 01:22:07.999
(laughter)

01:22:07.999 --> 01:22:12.831
LIAM: Perception check at disadvantage.

01:22:12.831 --> 01:22:15.791
MATT: Who's helming perception check on this?

01:22:15.791 --> 01:22:17.707
MARISHA: How's your perception?

01:22:17.707 --> 01:22:19.183
ASHLEY: Plus two.

01:22:19.183 --> 01:22:21.783
MARISHA: I have plus three.

01:22:21.783 --> 01:22:23.441
ASHLEY: You do it.

01:22:23.441 --> 01:22:29.347
MATT: So you're aiding. Technically, because it's
night, it would be a straight roll.

01:22:29.347 --> 01:22:32.913
MARISHA: No, she's advantaging me.

01:22:32.913 --> 01:22:39.213
MATT: The goggles are only a radius. This is a
general awareness, so it's just a single roll.

01:22:39.213 --> 01:22:41.871
You're helping her to maintain.

01:22:41.871 --> 01:22:46.576
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil, and 14.

01:22:46.576 --> 01:22:55.797
MATT: Keeping your senses around you and looking
about, the watch seems to go through, uneventful.

01:22:55.797 --> 01:23:00.268
MARISHA: Want to huddle together for body warmth?

01:23:00.268 --> 01:23:03.716
ASHLEY: Sure, but Frumpkin is making me so warm.

01:23:03.716 --> 01:23:06.580
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I'm good.

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:13.647
ASHLEY: I have a very warm shawl, too, but do you
want my--?

01:23:13.647 --> 01:23:25.227
MARISHA: No, my robe is good. It's thin, but it's
high thread count. It's very good.

01:23:25.227 --> 01:23:33.373
ASHLEY: This is as far as I've ever been, you
know?

01:23:33.373 --> 01:23:35.149
MARISHA: In terms of?

01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:37.364
SAM: (whispered) Romantically.

01:23:40.745 --> 01:23:49.690
ASHLEY: Here, I've only been to Xhorhas and
Zadash.

01:23:49.690 --> 01:24:01.163
MARISHA: How long since you left Xhorhas? Did you
grow up there? That's a better question, take that one.

01:24:01.163 --> 01:24:13.498
ASHLEY: I did grow up in Xhorhas. I did grow up
there, but I left there, I think it was about--

01:24:13.498 --> 01:24:16.748
SAM: (whispered) Eight months ago.

01:24:16.748 --> 01:24:25.947
ASHLEY: I think it was about eight months ago,
yeah, from what I can remember. All of this is

01:24:25.947 --> 01:24:36.952
still very new, you know? I like this stuff, grass
and things, you know?

01:24:36.952 --> 01:24:40.563
MARISHA: You appreciate grass?

01:24:40.563 --> 01:24:49.790
ASHLEY: I think so, it's a much softer ground to
sit on, you know? Instead of a marshy, sandy--

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:50.986
MARISHA: Wow, yeah?

01:24:50.986 --> 01:24:51.855
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:24:51.855 --> 01:25:01.438
MARISHA: Uh-huh. What was your favorite part about
Zadash? Xhorhas?

01:25:04.856 --> 01:25:11.157
ASHLEY: I don't know if I had a favorite part.

01:25:11.157 --> 01:25:13.966
MARISHA: Is it that bad?

01:25:13.966 --> 01:25:19.142
ASHLEY: I mean, it's all I know, but it's probably
not the best place to grow up, now that I'm seeing

01:25:19.142 --> 01:25:28.897
everything else, you know? I think, sometimes I
wish maybe it was a little different.

01:25:28.897 --> 01:25:39.366
MARISHA: Do you still have that "This is home"
connection with it though? No?

01:25:39.366 --> 01:25:45.549
ASHLEY: Yes. I think I will always have that.

01:25:45.549 --> 01:25:48.571
MARISHA: That's nice.

01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:51.464
ASHLEY: Well.

01:25:52.334 --> 01:25:54.494
MARISHA: I hope to see it someday.

01:25:54.494 --> 01:25:59.559
ASHLEY: I don't know if you're going to be that
impressed by it, but maybe you'll like it.

01:26:01.511 --> 01:26:06.068
MARISHA: You can see your breath (exhales).

01:26:07.331 --> 01:26:20.972
ASHLEY: Yeah. Well, I wonder, I mean, I wonder if
anyone else-- I think, is our time up, or--?

01:26:20.972 --> 01:26:21.977
MARISHA: I think so.

01:26:21.977 --> 01:26:26.507
(laughter)

01:26:26.507 --> 01:26:29.694
TRAVIS: That was such church youth trip flirting!

01:26:29.694 --> 01:26:32.074
MATT: I know.

01:26:32.074 --> 01:26:34.073
SAM: Great first date.

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:39.966
MATT: With that, your watch comes uneventful.

01:26:39.966 --> 01:26:44.122
LIAM: God's really cool, right? Right, right.

01:26:44.122 --> 01:26:46.098
MATT: Third and final watch.

01:26:46.098 --> 01:26:51.063
SAM: Me and Caleb. Me and Molly, I guess. I'm on
third watch.

01:26:51.063 --> 01:26:52.222
TALIESIN: I'll take third watch.

01:26:52.222 --> 01:26:54.760
MATT: Nott and Molly. Who's helming this one?

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.706
TALIESIN: What's your-- your perception's probably
high as balls.

01:26:56.706 --> 01:26:58.066
SAM: You don't know!

01:26:58.066 --> 01:26:59.656
TALIESIN: Yeah, you take it.

01:26:59.656 --> 01:27:04.749
MATT: Advantage on yours. Actually, it would have
been the first one. I started to realize, it's

01:27:04.749 --> 01:27:07.340
advantage, but disadvantage because it's night.

01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.194
SAM: Oh, ten. Why is it disadvantage?

01:27:09.194 --> 01:27:11.155
TRAVIS: Because it's night.

01:27:11.155 --> 01:27:20.969
MATT: As you guys get part way through your watch,
conversing, muttering about the recent events, the

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:22.232
sun comes up, uneventful.

01:27:22.232 --> 01:27:25.962
TALIESIN: Should've put money on Beau. Kicking
myself for not putting money on Beau.

01:27:25.962 --> 01:27:31.195
SAM: If it makes you feel any better, I lost money
on Jester on the next one.

01:27:31.195 --> 01:27:32.879
TALIESIN: It does actually make me feel better,
thank you!

01:27:32.879 --> 01:27:35.600
LAURA: What, you guys? I was at a disadvantage!

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.083
TALIESIN: You're not there, you can't hear any of
this.

01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:38.023
LAURA: We're all camping together!

01:27:38.023 --> 01:27:39.079
TALIESIN: You're asleep.

01:27:39.079 --> 01:27:41.387
LAURA: Oh, you guys are still on your watch.

01:27:43.997 --> 01:27:46.691
TALIESIN: Although that would be what I would
imagine Jester saying.

01:27:46.691 --> 01:27:51.515
MARISHA: That was just an impression.

01:27:51.515 --> 01:27:56.460
TALIESIN: (as Jester) Guys, it's so crazy, you
know? (as Taliesin) That was terrible.

01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:01.225
MARISHA: Wait, she's like Luigi? (as Luigi) It's
a-crazy!

01:28:01.225 --> 01:28:05.153
LIAM: Wild and crazy guys!

01:28:06.568 --> 01:28:14.551
MATT: (as Luigi) Let's-a go. (as Matt) With that,
morning comes. Without the necessary heat, the

01:28:14.551 --> 01:28:20.900
fire, the torch, goes out, and right as the frost
begins to cause you to shake yourself awake, the

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:24.659
morning comes, melting the dew, and you are
prepped up on your cart and ready for the next

01:28:24.659 --> 01:28:26.041
length of your journey.

01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:27.849
LAURA: It's so brisk and wonderful.

01:28:27.849 --> 01:28:31.699
LIAM: That was the best sleep I have had in a long
time.

01:28:31.699 --> 01:28:36.590
LAURA: Do you think The Gentleman wakes up with
frost on his face or his whole body?

01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:39.550
SAM: Probably! Unless he mops himself down at
night.

01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:42.545
LAURA: I wonder if he has to crack himself.

01:28:42.545 --> 01:28:48.648
SAM: Wait, think about his sheets! What a disaster
his sheets must be!

01:28:48.648 --> 01:28:51.886
LAURA: He has to wash them every night. They would
be so gross.

01:28:51.886 --> 01:28:55.567
TRAVIS: Like when you get a sunburn and you wake
up, and they're fucking sticking to you and stuff?

01:28:55.567 --> 01:28:58.465
It sucks.

01:28:58.465 --> 01:29:00.924
MARISHA: You're a little dewy, and you don't know
why?

01:29:00.924 --> 01:29:03.161
TRAVIS: You've got to rip them off, just one big
one.

01:29:03.161 --> 01:29:06.972
LAURA: Hey Nott, do you think we're going to go by
your hometown when we're driving up here?

01:29:06.972 --> 01:29:12.357
SAM: No, my hometown is further to the south, it's
the opposite direction.

01:29:12.357 --> 01:29:13.307
LAURA: Oh really?

01:29:13.307 --> 01:29:26.297
SAM: Yes. But there is no hometown. We travel
around a lot, we have an area of operation, but

01:29:26.297 --> 01:29:29.289
never really called one place home.

01:29:29.289 --> 01:29:36.767
LAURA: So you're nomadic. Do you have little huts
you put up as camping tents?

01:29:36.767 --> 01:29:42.131
SAM: Yeah, there's tents, and some people sleep in
bags or huddle together.

01:29:42.131 --> 01:29:45.247
Whatever we can find, really, leaves.

01:29:45.247 --> 01:29:48.559
LAURA: Did you like that?

01:29:48.559 --> 01:29:51.065
SAM: No, it's terrible. Would you like that?

01:29:51.065 --> 01:29:53.279
LAURA: I don't know, I've never tried it!

01:29:53.279 --> 01:29:59.766
SAM: No, it's not fun at all. You find whatever
piece of cloth you can and wrap yourself in it and

01:29:59.766 --> 01:30:03.412
some mud and that's your bed. It's terrible.

01:30:03.412 --> 01:30:05.853
LAURA: Is that why you left?

01:30:05.853 --> 01:30:11.331
SAM: That and many other things, yes. Have you
ever seen a goblin before?

01:30:13.793 --> 01:30:15.697
LAURA: I saw you.

01:30:15.697 --> 01:30:18.142
SAM: Yes. Well, have you seen any others?

01:30:18.142 --> 01:30:19.342
LAURA: No.

01:30:19.342 --> 01:30:22.218
SAM: Have you heard stories of them?

01:30:22.218 --> 01:30:28.173
LAURA: I could tell you, but I feel like it's
offensive or something.

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:34.250
SAM: I mean, you can tell me. There's no love
there. Everything you've heard about goblins is

01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:37.461
true. They're awful in every way.

01:30:37.461 --> 01:30:41.178
LAURA: Well, my mom used to tell me that if you
act up too much, the goblins will come in the

01:30:41.178 --> 01:30:43.491
middle of the night and steal you away.

01:30:43.491 --> 01:30:46.155
LIAM: My father used to tell me that they would
steal children. <i>Ja.</i>

01:30:46.155 --> 01:30:47.567
LAURA: Yeah.

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:55.710
SAM: All right, so that's true. But it doesn't
really matter if you're good or bad; we will come

01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:59.447
and steal you if you are a child, anyway.

01:30:59.447 --> 01:31:02.237
LAURA: And would you eat? Because my mom said you
would eat them!

01:31:02.237 --> 01:31:08.523
SAM: Take it easy. We would share with the rest of
the clan. But of course we would eat children.

01:31:08.523 --> 01:31:12.217
TRAVIS: Is she telling the truth? Do I feel like
she's telling the truth?

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:16.084
LIAM: Excuse me, Nott, are you taking the piss
right now?

01:31:16.084 --> 01:31:22.348
SAM: I'm really not. Goblins are terrible,
terrible creatures.

01:31:22.348 --> 01:31:26.236
LAURA: Did you ever eat a little child, Nott?

01:31:26.236 --> 01:31:30.365
SAM: With great honesty I can tell you that I've
never eaten a child.

01:31:30.365 --> 01:31:36.101
TALIESIN: Insight check. I've been holding out.

01:31:36.101 --> 01:31:39.396
MATT: If you wish to see if she's telling the
truth, roll an insight check.

01:31:39.396 --> 01:31:44.112
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:31:44.112 --> 01:31:46.179
TALIESIN: Nope. Natural one.

01:31:46.179 --> 01:31:48.308
SAM: Kind of hard to read.

01:31:48.308 --> 01:31:53.587
MATT: She's hard to read. She seems honest and
forthright in what she's saying.

01:31:53.587 --> 01:31:56.171
TALIESIN: Has she tasted human flesh?

01:31:56.171 --> 01:32:09.775
SAM: Listen. My clan, I can't speak for other
clans, but the goblins that I was with for quite

01:32:09.775 --> 01:32:18.323
some time, we stole from people. We stole food, we
stole money when we could, we stole clothing and

01:32:18.323 --> 01:32:24.921
provisions, but when times were tough, we would
steal the people, too.

01:32:24.921 --> 01:32:30.091
TRAVIS: You and your brothers and sisters? Or you
and your children or parents?

01:32:30.091 --> 01:32:37.628
SAM: Well, goblins don't really-- I'm sure I have
parents.

01:32:37.628 --> 01:32:40.473
TRAVIS: Oh. But you're not super tight with them.

01:32:40.473 --> 01:32:51.969
SAM: Yeah. Once a child is born and nursed for a
bit and then it's communal property. As soon as

01:32:51.969 --> 01:32:55.310
you can work, they give you a job and you do the
job.

01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:58.195
TRAVIS: No favorite brother or sister or playmate
or--

01:32:58.195 --> 01:33:00.717
LAURA: Do you even know who your brothers and
sisters are?

01:33:00.717 --> 01:33:06.166
SAM: Everyone in the clan, I assume, is related
somehow, but--

01:33:06.166 --> 01:33:08.815
LAURA: Oh.

01:33:09.477 --> 01:33:12.835
SAM: Yeah. There was no real family ties.

01:33:12.835 --> 01:33:17.151
TRAVIS: Do you fight any urges when you see a
small child walking through the city, to go up

01:33:17.151 --> 01:33:22.515
and, I don't know, I don't mean any disrespect,
but to snatch it?

01:33:22.515 --> 01:33:24.383
LAURA: That sounds a little shitty, Fjord.

01:33:24.383 --> 01:33:26.928
MARISHA: That's definitely a little shitty.

01:33:26.928 --> 01:33:29.929
ASHLEY: But yeah, you don't see it and you don't
get hungry?

01:33:29.929 --> 01:33:33.639
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I'm being honest. Because if I
know there's a little kid running around, and if

01:33:33.639 --> 01:33:38.127
you're fucking tracing the damn thing, I want to
know that I can put a hand out.

01:33:38.127 --> 01:33:41.850
LIAM: With all due respect, she is smarter than
that.

01:33:42.563 --> 01:33:49.480
SAM: Caleb, as always, is right. I do not have an
urge to kill and eat children.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.832
TRAVIS: Just checking. I haven't met many that do,
so pardon my, you know--

01:33:52.832 --> 01:34:01.695
SAM: I do have cravings for things I assume you,
other species, do not.

01:34:01.695 --> 01:34:04.407
LAURA: Like what? Maybe we do.

01:34:04.407 --> 01:34:05.360
SAM: Rats.

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.736
ASHLEY: Well, that I understand.

01:34:07.736 --> 01:34:09.520
SAM: Cats sometimes.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.323
LIAM: Frumpkin goes back to the Feywild.

01:34:12.323 --> 01:34:15.227
SAM: Bacon. I really like bacon.

01:34:15.227 --> 01:34:17.694
LAURA: Everyone likes bacon. Bacon is super good.

01:34:17.694 --> 01:34:24.874
SAM: Just in general, meat is pretty good, but no.
A human child is a wonderful thing. Why would I

01:34:24.874 --> 01:34:27.946
want to kill or hurt a human child?

01:34:27.946 --> 01:34:30.316
LAURA: Yeah! She doesn't want to hurt her baby,
Caleb!

01:34:30.316 --> 01:34:39.225
SAM: No. I'm not bloodthirsty. I just get hungry
for food sometimes. Not for flesh. I just like meat.

01:34:39.225 --> 01:34:41.279
MARISHA: I think I still have some pocket bacon.
You want some?

01:34:41.279 --> 01:34:42.259
SAM: I would love some.

01:34:42.259 --> 01:34:43.696
MARISHA: Yeah, here you go. Yeah.

01:34:43.696 --> 01:34:51.909
SAM: (eating noises) No. I like children a great
deal.

01:34:51.909 --> 01:34:52.892
TRAVIS: In your belly?

01:34:52.892 --> 01:34:56.813
SAM: No! Not in my belly! You're borderline
offensive!

01:34:56.813 --> 01:35:01.718
TRAVIS: All Fjord sees is a little kid's hand,
like chewing on a little kid's hand

01:35:01.718 --> 01:35:05.035
MATT: Who's helming watch as you guys are
traveling?

01:35:05.035 --> 01:35:07.085
TALIESIN: I mean, I'm on one of the horses. Yeah.

01:35:07.085 --> 01:35:09.399
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

01:35:09.662 --> 01:35:16.381
TALIESIN: Oh no. This'll be funny. Come on, first
good roll of the day. That'll do. That's a 16.

01:35:16.381 --> 01:35:23.243
MATT: That's enough. As you guys are continuing,
about midday or so, you're hitting the noonday

01:35:23.243 --> 01:35:30.849
sun, and some of the clouds have broken up
briefly. You notice a tiny distant curl of smoke

01:35:30.849 --> 01:35:37.830
over one of the hills. Just a lazy little line of
darkness across the--

01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:42.030
TALIESIN: Does it look like happy fire smoke, or
bad, unfortunate, something's burning, dark?--

01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:43.518
MATT: It looks very localized.

01:35:43.518 --> 01:35:48.024
SAM: Listen everyone, this is what happened to me.
Here is my definite backstory.

01:35:48.024 --> 01:35:51.388
TALIESIN: No, we'll do this later. Do you see the
smoke over there?

01:35:51.388 --> 01:35:52.431
SAM: --one day--

01:35:52.431 --> 01:35:57.540
TALIESIN: (loudly) Everybody, there's smoke over
there. We've got to get hold of this right now.

01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:03.286
There's definitely a plume of smoke. I don't know
what it means, I don't know what it's about, it

01:36:03.286 --> 01:36:07.597
could be a good thing, it could be a bad thing,
but we have to stop this conversation right in its tracks.

01:36:07.597 --> 01:36:11.170
SAM: All right, what is it? Does it look like good
smoke or bad smoke?

01:36:11.170 --> 01:36:14.271
TALIESIN: Honestly, I can't tell from here. It's
very localized.

01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:16.461
LAURA: Is it into the woods or is it further
along?

01:36:16.461 --> 01:36:18.300
TALIESIN: Is it into the woods, or further along?

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:24.456
MATT: You cannot see. It's over one of the larger
hills that's blocking what its source is. It's

01:36:24.456 --> 01:36:30.832
about a mile or so off of the road if you were to
go ahead in that direction.

01:36:30.832 --> 01:36:32.045
TALIESIN: It's about a mile off the road.

01:36:32.045 --> 01:36:33.698
MARISHA: It's just chimney smoke. Just keep
moving.

01:36:33.698 --> 01:36:36.461
TALIESIN: It doesn't look like chimney smoke. I'm
not sure.

01:36:36.461 --> 01:36:38.431
TRAVIS: So there's fire. So what?

01:36:38.431 --> 01:36:39.889
MARISHA: Campfire smoke?

01:36:39.889 --> 01:36:42.447
TALIESIN: Does it look like campfire smoke?

01:36:42.447 --> 01:36:47.294
MATT: It could be. It could be chimney smoke. It's
not a billowing column.

01:36:47.294 --> 01:36:51.470
MARISHA: It's not a <i>billowing column.</i>

01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:55.073
SAM: When you say it, it has such a different
color to it.

01:36:55.073 --> 01:37:01.777
TALIESIN: There's people, though. Or something.

01:37:01.777 --> 01:37:03.304
SAM: They're burning people?

01:37:03.304 --> 01:37:05.423
TALIESIN: I mean, just be on alert. They could be
burning anything.

01:37:05.423 --> 01:37:06.881
SAM: We call that a barbecue.

01:37:06.881 --> 01:37:10.888
(laughter)

01:37:10.888 --> 01:37:13.180
TALIESIN: We'll find, once and for all, the
answer: What do children taste like?

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:18.033
MATT: Continuing onward, about ten minutes later
you get just around the edge of where that hill

01:37:18.033 --> 01:37:25.774
was, and you can see the source of the smoke.
There, nestled between a small cluster of trees

01:37:25.774 --> 01:37:33.320
and a bit of natural rock formations, a small
shack that the smoke is coming from.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.941
LAURA: It's a small shack.

01:37:35.941 --> 01:37:37.999
MATT: Continue going forward on the road?

01:37:37.999 --> 01:37:40.784
LAURA: Should we go knock on the door?

01:37:40.784 --> 01:37:45.275
TRAVIS: Did you want to see if somebody worth
bargaining with or something?

01:37:45.275 --> 01:37:47.088
LIAM: Why don't we send my cat?

01:37:47.088 --> 01:37:47.956
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:37:47.956 --> 01:37:50.283
MARISHA: Weird people live in shacks in the woods.

01:37:50.283 --> 01:37:52.035
TALIESIN: They'll be happy to see a cat.

01:37:52.035 --> 01:37:52.891
TRAVIS: Send the cat.

01:37:52.891 --> 01:37:54.511
TALIESIN: I don't think we're even going to pull
over.

01:37:54.511 --> 01:37:55.660
LAURA: No, we'll just keep going.

01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:58.060
TRAVIS: Is the shed from where we are now, still
like a mile away?

01:37:58.060 --> 01:37:59.134
MATT: Yeah, it's about a mile away.

01:37:59.134 --> 01:38:00.794
LIAM: If it's of interest, we can turn around.

01:38:00.794 --> 01:38:02.070
LAURA: The shack is a mile away.

01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:03.222
LIAM: A mile away?

01:38:03.222 --> 01:38:04.805
LIAM: Oh.

01:38:04.805 --> 01:38:08.251
LAURA: Can Frumpkin be a bird?

01:38:08.251 --> 01:38:10.635
LIAM: (reluctantly) Yeah.

01:38:10.635 --> 01:38:12.232
TALIESIN: For a bit.

01:38:12.232 --> 01:38:13.550
TRAVIS: I want to check out the shack.

01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:18.402
LIAM: All right. For you, Fjord, I will make
Frumpkin a bird.

01:38:18.402 --> 01:38:21.532
LAURA: Not for me, though. Caleb hates me.

01:38:21.532 --> 01:38:27.219
SAM: We could just walk over there. It's a hassle
to turn him into a bird.

01:38:27.219 --> 01:38:29.118
TRAVIS: Yeah. Keep your cat.

01:38:29.118 --> 01:38:32.828
LIAM: You are more sensitive than I would have
imagined.

01:38:32.828 --> 01:38:34.486
LAURA: I want people to like me.

01:38:34.486 --> 01:38:37.511
LIAM: You're so tough, but everybody here likes
you.

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:40.061
SAM: Yasha's leading the way?

01:38:40.061 --> 01:38:41.490
LAURA: You're checking out the shack?

01:38:41.490 --> 01:38:44.776
LIAM: I was just about to make a really cool owl.
Are we really? Okay.

01:38:44.776 --> 01:38:47.189
MARISHA: A really cool hour?

01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:49.528
MATT: Yasha's going to the shack. Is it just
Yasha?

01:38:49.528 --> 01:38:50.475
TALIESIN: I'm following.

01:38:50.475 --> 01:38:51.300
TRAVIS: I'm going too.

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.121
LIAM: Wait, she's going to the shack?

01:38:52.121 --> 01:38:53.239
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:38:53.239 --> 01:38:55.182
MATT: Okay, so Yasha, Molly, and Fjord are heading
to the shack.

01:38:55.182 --> 01:38:57.202
ASHLEY: We'll be right back!

01:38:57.202 --> 01:39:00.332
LIAM: I put Frumpkin back on her shoulder.

01:39:00.332 --> 01:39:06.150
MATT: As you guys make your way up, cresting the
hill, down into this small, localized valley

01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:11.502
toward where the shack is with the clusters of
trees and the edge of a small forest cluster is a

01:39:11.502 --> 01:39:14.895
little bit past it. You approach the shack, and as
you get towards it you get a better look at it.

01:39:14.895 --> 01:39:21.811
It's made of simple masonry and stones lodged
together to create the outer walls of it. It can't

01:39:21.811 --> 01:39:28.392
be more than 20 feet by 20 feet in size. It's not
a large abode. There is one brick chimney where

01:39:28.392 --> 01:39:33.870
that single curl of smoke that was visible off
your end was there, there's a wood chopping block

01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:38.398
on the outside with an axe embedded and left in it
with couple of pieces of firewood off to the side.

01:39:38.398 --> 01:39:47.710
There's a tanning easel set there for whoever has
been utilizing it. There is a front door. You see

01:39:47.710 --> 01:39:55.324
a window that has no glass in it. It's maybe that
big or so, it's more for keeping an eye out, or

01:39:55.324 --> 01:39:56.575
looking through it.

01:39:56.575 --> 01:39:59.929
TRAVIS: Scanning the land and the trees around,
doing a quick once-over of the close area.

01:39:59.929 --> 01:40:01.704
MATT: Perception check.

01:40:02.789 --> 01:40:03.917
TRAVIS: Six.

01:40:03.917 --> 01:40:06.954
MATT: Looks fine.

01:40:06.954 --> 01:40:08.581
TRAVIS: Looks clear.

01:40:08.581 --> 01:40:12.329
TALIESIN: Great.

01:40:14.876 --> 01:40:16.217
TRAVIS: I'll head around back.

01:40:16.217 --> 01:40:19.496
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to get off my horse.

01:40:19.496 --> 01:40:20.640
MATT: You get off the horse.

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.619
LIAM: I'm going to start looking through Frumpkin
in an attempt to let Yasha know I am with her. I

01:40:24.619 --> 01:40:32.028
make Frumpkin do this to her forehead (knocking)
with his paw.

01:40:32.028 --> 01:40:34.280
MATT: This soft paw starts tapping you in the
face.

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.351
ASHLEY: (spitting) Stop it.

01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:43.323
LIAM: Oh, that's a good question. I know that we
were loosey-goosey with familiar things. I know

01:40:43.323 --> 01:40:47.978
that we've said that I can see this far away, but
I probably cannot make him do that this far away.

01:40:47.978 --> 01:40:49.075
MATT: Command, right.

01:40:49.075 --> 01:40:52.426
LIAM: 100 feet, I take it back.

01:40:52.426 --> 01:40:57.543
MATT: You still blow, and the fur gets in your
nose. Fjord, you head around back? In the back,

01:40:57.543 --> 01:41:04.742
there's a couple of cured and salted meats that
are hanging from the back of the ramshackled roof

01:41:04.742 --> 01:41:11.688
that ends, and curves down a bit. Over time the
weathering has caused it to curl under. There is

01:41:11.688 --> 01:41:14.912
another doorway that leads in the back. It looks
like there is no window back here. There is a

01:41:14.912 --> 01:41:18.373
single window out front, and there are two doors
in the front and back of it.

01:41:18.373 --> 01:41:22.919
TRAVIS: I'll make my way another quarter way
around the house so I can see Yasha and Molly, and

01:41:22.919 --> 01:41:27.982
I'll say: Go ahead, I'll keep an eye out. I can
see both.

01:41:27.982 --> 01:41:29.456
ASHLEY: I'm going to knock on the door, yeah?

01:41:29.456 --> 01:41:31.188
TALIESIN: That seems fair.

01:41:31.188 --> 01:41:34.490
ASHLEY: (knocking)

01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:47.217
MATT: You hear a little bit of rustling, a couple
heavy footsteps. You hear a large metal rod shift,

01:41:47.217 --> 01:42:01.584
and it creaks open, about two to three inches.
There you see what I can only describe as an

01:42:01.584 --> 01:42:09.457
elderly full-blood orc. His head wreathed and
tangled grey coarse hair, like a crown around the

01:42:09.457 --> 01:42:15.396
top of the head that goes past the mouth and over
the chest to about mid-point there. A foot-long

01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:21.455
beard around his chin that ends at about the
bottom of the clavicle, or the sternum. Muscular

01:42:21.455 --> 01:42:29.345
and hunched, his gray-green skin looks thick and
weathered, and folded crow's nests under where the

01:42:29.345 --> 01:42:35.401
nose and the mouth is, the two heavy tusks
protruding from underneath the lower jaw. His eyes

01:42:35.401 --> 01:42:42.477
are sunken and bloodshot, around the side of the
yellow sclera. One hand opens the door, while

01:42:42.477 --> 01:42:49.456
another one remains out of sight. As the face
pushes forward to inspect you, a low voice says,

01:42:49.456 --> 01:42:52.876
"Your business?"

01:42:52.876 --> 01:42:59.750
ASHLEY: Oh, yes, hello. We were just passing
through and we saw some smoke, so we just wanted

01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:06.986
to make sure everything was okay, and come over
here and check on you, but you seem to be fine.

01:43:06.986 --> 01:43:09.241
MATT: "Everything is fine."

01:43:09.241 --> 01:43:14.656
TALIESIN: Selling any wares? Or do you need any
news from the other side of the road?

01:43:14.656 --> 01:43:17.360
MATT: "Have you news to share?"

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.530
TALIESIN: There are skirmishes at the border, and
soldiers are moving east, lots of them, worth

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:26.368
noting. We're trying to avoid it.

01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:31.404
MATT: "Good to know." The door begins to close.

01:43:31.404 --> 01:43:34.528
ASHLEY: But did you have-- I don't think you
answered the other part of what he was saying. Do

01:43:34.528 --> 01:43:37.599
you have any wares for--

01:43:37.599 --> 01:43:40.217
TALIESIN: For sale.

01:43:40.217 --> 01:43:41.698
ASHLEY: For sale?

01:43:41.698 --> 01:43:43.486
MATT: Leans further in.

01:43:43.486 --> 01:43:44.831
ASHLEY: Like some meats.

01:43:44.831 --> 01:43:46.064
MATT: Make a charisma check.

01:43:46.064 --> 01:43:48.516
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah!

01:43:52.211 --> 01:43:53.770
ASHLEY: Now, I have a minus two, guys.

01:43:53.770 --> 01:43:56.159
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's still.

01:43:56.159 --> 01:43:57.838
ASHLEY: Yeah. 11.

01:43:57.838 --> 01:44:00.242
MATT: Okay, all right.

01:44:00.242 --> 01:44:03.394
ASHLEY: Shimmy the shake.

01:44:03.394 --> 01:44:10.518
MATT: Glaring at you with one eye peeking through.
There's a bit of a grunt, and the breath emanates,

01:44:10.518 --> 01:44:21.168
and it smells of heavy pepper and dust. A bit of
smokiness to it. The door opens slightly more, and

01:44:21.168 --> 01:44:29.225
the head peeks through to give you a good look
over. "Maybe for trade."

01:44:29.225 --> 01:44:32.468
ASHLEY: What kind of trade?

01:44:32.468 --> 01:44:38.239
MATT: "What do you have to trade?"

01:44:38.239 --> 01:44:40.776
SAM: The cat!

01:44:40.776 --> 01:44:42.857
MATT: Reaches out and--

01:44:42.857 --> 01:44:44.837
ASHLEY: No.

01:44:44.837 --> 01:44:46.271
SAM: Yeah, do it.

01:44:46.271 --> 01:44:49.885
ASHLEY: I'm just moving him around. I can't!

01:44:49.885 --> 01:44:55.650
TALIESIN: We have some bits and pieces, what do
you need? We have gold, but you don't really

01:44:55.650 --> 01:44:57.522
strike me as the type who cares.

01:44:57.522 --> 01:45:02.575
MATT: "Gold doesn't hurt other passersby."

01:45:02.575 --> 01:45:09.531
TALIESIN: I've got a few bits. What do you need?
Do you need tools?

01:45:09.531 --> 01:45:12.335
MATT: "Tools are helpful."

01:45:12.335 --> 01:45:14.925
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out--

01:45:14.925 --> 01:45:19.134
MATT: "Vegetables. Fresh produce, maybe."

01:45:19.134 --> 01:45:23.419
TALIESIN: Do we have anything? Fresh produce we're
a little thin on because we're just on the road,

01:45:23.419 --> 01:45:24.983
but we do have--

01:45:24.983 --> 01:45:27.481
ASHLEY: We might have some bacon.

01:45:27.481 --> 01:45:31.871
MATT: He opens the door a bit further and looks to
the left. He looks to the right. You're off to the

01:45:31.871 --> 01:45:39.614
side of the wall, though, so you don't see him and
he doesn't see you. He goes, "Come in," and opens

01:45:39.614 --> 01:45:44.941
the door fully and steps back. You can now see he
had, in the other hand, a really nasty-looking,

01:45:44.941 --> 01:45:50.744
somewhat rusted battleaxe that he had right around
the door, just in case. He goes and sets the loop

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:54.905
of the handle of it and puts it over a knob that's
in the wall and then steps inside his small hovel

01:45:54.905 --> 01:46:01.976
as you look in the inside. It's fairly bare, but
there are lots of furs that have been skinned and

01:46:01.976 --> 01:46:07.401
cured that are up on the walls that are hanging,
from wolves, from badgers, different other

01:46:07.401 --> 01:46:12.128
creatures that he's probably hunted and brought in
here for the tanning process. You see, hanging on

01:46:12.128 --> 01:46:20.300
the edge, a handmade piece of hide armor that has
been recently stained, and as soon as you get

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:29.102
close you can smell the stained scent off of it.
You get the sense here, based on the tanning stuff

01:46:29.102 --> 01:46:33.024
set up outside, that that's probably part of his
trading business.

01:46:33.024 --> 01:46:37.560
TALIESIN: That's a nice piece of hide armor.
That's very nice.

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:46.596
MATT: "It's also for trade or purchase. Also, I
have meats. I have pelts."

01:46:46.596 --> 01:46:50.354
ASHLEY: How much are you selling the hide armor
for?

01:46:50.354 --> 01:46:58.662
MATT: He thinks to himself for a second and
considers the time and energy he's put into it.

01:46:58.662 --> 01:47:06.358
"Handmade. 15 gold pieces."

01:47:06.358 --> 01:47:16.146
TALIESIN: How about 16 gold pieces and you throw
in a little bit of meat?

01:47:16.146 --> 01:47:19.151
MATT: "I give you two pounds of meat."

01:47:19.151 --> 01:47:22.194
TALIESIN: Perfect.

01:47:22.194 --> 01:47:31.353
MATT: He coughs a bit, goes over, and starts
grabbing the armor and pulling it off of the knob

01:47:31.353 --> 01:47:35.712
and setting it down, grabbing some meat. He opens
the back door and steps out and starts pulling it

01:47:35.712 --> 01:47:39.816
off of some of the racks of nails on there.

01:47:39.816 --> 01:47:42.066
TRAVIS: I can hear it, but I can't see it.

01:47:42.066 --> 01:47:44.341
MATT: Yeah. You're staying where you are?

01:47:44.341 --> 01:47:49.314
TRAVIS: I'll start making my way over to their
horses, having heard them go inside. I think.

01:47:49.314 --> 01:47:51.873
LIAM: I would say Caleb has been narrating this to
everybody back.

01:47:51.873 --> 01:47:54.046
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

01:47:56.744 --> 01:47:58.273
TALIESIN: Ten.

01:47:58.273 --> 01:48:09.074
MATT: Ten? Okay. He grabs the meats, sets them in
a small sack, ties it up, hands it over. The armor

01:48:09.074 --> 01:48:12.777
he preps and folds and sets over, hands it to
you.

01:48:12.777 --> 01:48:17.078
TALIESIN: I pay the man. Pleasure doing business
with you. Be careful. There's soldiers running

01:48:17.078 --> 01:48:20.127
around all over the place right now.

01:48:20.127 --> 01:48:21.692
MATT: "I'm aware."

01:48:21.692 --> 01:48:22.931
TALIESIN: Have a lovely day.

01:48:22.931 --> 01:48:26.627
ASHLEY: Thank you very much. Apologies for
intruding.

01:48:26.627 --> 01:48:34.188
MATT: "Good luck." He closes the door. You hear
(deadbolts locking).

01:48:34.188 --> 01:48:35.173
TRAVIS: Who was that?

01:48:35.173 --> 01:48:36.620
TALIESIN: I've met weirder.

01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:38.728
TRAVIS: What was in there?

01:48:38.728 --> 01:48:40.790
ASHLEY: It looks like there's some hide armor.

01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:41.770
TALIESIN: And meat.

01:48:41.770 --> 01:48:43.722
TRAVIS: Oh. Nice.

01:48:43.722 --> 01:48:45.723
ASHLEY: Yeah, we got some food for the road.

01:48:45.723 --> 01:48:47.900
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:51.786
TALIESIN: There was a trapdoor in the floor and
there were just people stuck underneath there,

01:48:51.786 --> 01:48:57.749
wasn't there? Three more points on that perception
roll and I'd have been like "That carpet looks

01:48:57.749 --> 01:48:59.524
like it's been moved recently."

01:48:59.524 --> 01:49:03.042
ASHLEY: Shit.

01:49:03.042 --> 01:49:05.159
TALIESIN: It's all right.

01:49:05.159 --> 01:49:06.989
TRAVIS: Was it just the one guy in there?

01:49:06.989 --> 01:49:09.235
ASHLEY: It seemed like it.

01:49:09.235 --> 01:49:11.066
TALIESIN: I think I've met weirder people.

01:49:11.066 --> 01:49:13.554
ASHLEY: He is selling stuff if you want to go
check.

01:49:13.554 --> 01:49:16.697
TRAVIS: What did he have? Just meat and--

01:49:16.697 --> 01:49:17.962
ASHLEY: Meat and--

01:49:17.962 --> 01:49:19.755
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Armor.

01:49:19.755 --> 01:49:20.636
TRAVIS: Nah.

01:49:20.636 --> 01:49:25.255
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay. Shall we?

01:49:25.255 --> 01:49:29.901
MATT: You guys mount back up on your horses and
make your way back to the rest of the group on the cart.

01:49:30.315 --> 01:49:32.858
TALIESIN: What kind of armor is it out of?

01:49:32.858 --> 01:49:33.780
MATT: It's hide armor.

01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:34.727
TALIESIN: It's hide armor?

01:49:34.727 --> 01:49:40.608
MATT: It's well-made, hand-crafted hide armor, for
anybody who would have use for it, whether it be

01:49:40.608 --> 01:49:42.118
using or reselling it. That's up to you.

01:49:42.118 --> 01:49:44.923
TALIESIN: All right.

01:49:44.923 --> 01:49:45.684
SAM: Nothing?

01:49:45.684 --> 01:49:47.076
TALIESIN: We made a friend.

01:49:47.076 --> 01:49:48.834
LAURA: Did you kill someone for that?

01:49:48.834 --> 01:49:50.411
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:49:50.411 --> 01:49:51.542
ASHLEY: He's dead.

01:49:51.542 --> 01:49:55.081
TALIESIN: He's very dead. And then he rose up from
the grave again and we had to kill him again.

01:49:55.081 --> 01:49:56.906
Twice. Same man.

01:49:56.906 --> 01:49:58.577
ASHLEY: But that shack is now ours.

01:49:58.577 --> 01:50:00.245
LAURA: Great!

01:50:00.245 --> 01:50:01.961
SAM: Great! Can we stay the night there?

01:50:01.961 --> 01:50:04.763
LAURA: Maybe we should just live here instead of
going anywhere else.

01:50:04.763 --> 01:50:06.564
TALIESIN: I'm thinking of planting soybeans.

01:50:06.564 --> 01:50:09.604
LIAM: This is our kingdom.

01:50:09.604 --> 01:50:11.993
ASHLEY: This is our keep. What do we name it?

01:50:11.993 --> 01:50:14.920
LIAM: Small Shit Keep.

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.173
TRAVIS: Shall we?

01:50:16.173 --> 01:50:18.004
LAURA: Let's keep going.

01:50:18.004 --> 01:50:23.474
MATT: You guys continue onward for the rest of the
day until, eventually, the sun sets and you find

01:50:23.474 --> 01:50:27.656
yourselves with evening quickly taking the sky.

01:50:27.656 --> 01:50:31.000
MARISHA: Let's make camp before we completely lose
light this time.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.879
TRAVIS: Good call.

01:50:32.879 --> 01:50:34.908
MATT: Who's helming the search for a good place to
camp?

01:50:34.908 --> 01:50:36.259
TRAVIS: I'll look this time.

01:50:36.259 --> 01:50:37.625
MARISHA: I'll help.

01:50:37.625 --> 01:50:41.168
MATT: Perception check with advantage because the
sun is still up.

01:50:41.168 --> 01:50:43.284
LAURA: Don't fuck this up, Fjord.

01:50:43.284 --> 01:50:46.687
MARISHA: You rolled the same, well, almost the
same.

01:50:46.687 --> 01:50:47.679
TRAVIS: Ten.

01:50:47.679 --> 01:50:48.983
MARISHA: Wait, but I'm helping him.

01:50:48.983 --> 01:50:50.273
MATT: So he got advantage.

01:50:50.273 --> 01:50:52.395
MARISHA: Plus? But you said advantage? Oh, right.

01:50:52.395 --> 01:50:53.350
TRAVIS: Ten.

01:50:53.350 --> 01:51:01.041
MATT: You glance off, and maybe about 30 minutes
up the road you can see a small forest, maybe two

01:51:01.041 --> 01:51:07.766
or three miles in diameter. It's a cluster of
trees and would probably be a way

01:51:07.766 --> 01:51:09.763
to camp off of the road.

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:12.321
TRAVIS: There's a cluster of trees up ahead. We
could aim for that.

01:51:12.321 --> 01:51:13.524
TALIESIN: That'll do.

01:51:13.524 --> 01:51:14.964
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

01:51:14.964 --> 01:51:17.071
TALIESIN: What kind of meat is this, out of
curiosity?

01:51:17.071 --> 01:51:19.847
MATT: Make a nature check.

01:51:21.417 --> 01:51:24.654
TALIESIN: Nope. It's just going today.

01:51:24.654 --> 01:51:27.172
MATT: It is meat.

01:51:27.172 --> 01:51:29.622
TALIESIN: As far as I know, it could be veggie.

01:51:29.622 --> 01:51:31.583
ASHLEY: I'm going to take a little niblet of it.

01:51:31.583 --> 01:51:35.905
MATT: It's good. It's a little dry, but it's
salted. It's cured. It'll keep for a while.

01:51:35.905 --> 01:51:38.007
A little chewy.

01:51:38.007 --> 01:51:42.835
ASHLEY: It's very good. From tasting it, do I know
what it is?

01:51:42.835 --> 01:51:44.171
MATT: Make a nature check.

01:51:45.401 --> 01:51:47.702
TALIESIN: If only I had help counting to the
number four!

01:51:47.702 --> 01:51:49.841
LAURA: Have you ever tried human before?

01:51:52.159 --> 01:51:58.048
ASHLEY: We'll see. Don't fuck me, Gil. Five.

01:51:58.048 --> 01:52:00.103
MATT: It's good.

01:52:00.103 --> 01:52:01.871
ASHLEY: It's very good.

01:52:01.871 --> 01:52:03.887
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to want more of this.
I'm not sure where it's coming from,

01:52:03.887 --> 01:52:04.871
but I definitely think--

01:52:04.871 --> 01:52:06.243
ASHLEY: Yeah, I like it a lot.

01:52:06.243 --> 01:52:07.822
TALIESIN: I'm getting a taste for it.

01:52:07.822 --> 01:52:09.326
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's a delicacy.

01:52:09.326 --> 01:52:16.526
LAURA: I'm going to start making a nice, pretty
bed in the cart. It's going to be really nice looking.

01:52:16.526 --> 01:52:18.249
SAM: For all of us or just you?

01:52:18.249 --> 01:52:20.411
LAURA: For anyone who wants to stay in here with
me.

01:52:20.411 --> 01:52:21.740
SAM: I would like that.

01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.516
LAURA Okay.

01:52:23.516 --> 01:52:25.631
MARISHA: I'm going to make a fire again.

01:52:25.631 --> 01:52:28.902
TRAVIS: We can break off some branches and some
kindling.

01:52:28.902 --> 01:52:30.937
TALIESIN: There's trees.

01:52:30.937 --> 01:52:34.906
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. You manage to set up
right as the sun completes setting. You build up

01:52:34.906 --> 01:52:40.079
this little campfire in the center. You set up
your bedding around it. The cart is a little ways

01:52:40.079 --> 01:52:45.034
off. Unless you're putting the bedding in the cart
and putting that there next to it? Okay. You put

01:52:45.034 --> 01:52:45.992
the cart there.

01:52:45.992 --> 01:52:47.638
LIAM: Silver thread.

01:52:47.638 --> 01:52:50.320
MATT: Thread around the edges. Okay. Who's taking
first watch?

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.231
ASHLEY: I'll take first watch.

01:52:52.231 --> 01:52:56.048
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take first watch. Unless
someone objects. All right, that'll do. Do you

01:52:56.048 --> 01:53:00.700
want to or-- What's your-- I'll take it.

01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:04.645
MATT: Roll a normal roll because you are keeping
an eye through darkness.

01:53:04.645 --> 01:53:06.039
TALIESIN: But I have night vision?

01:53:06.039 --> 01:53:08.066
MATT: Night vision is only out to a certain
radius.

01:53:10.929 --> 01:53:12.131
TALIESIN: 12.

01:53:12.131 --> 01:53:17.368
MATT: You both maintain the first watch as you
continue looking out towards the darkness beyond

01:53:17.368 --> 01:53:23.135
the visible trees that are refracting what little
bit of light makes it to their bark. Looking into

01:53:23.135 --> 01:53:28.772
the shadows, your watch comes to an end,
uneventful.

01:53:28.772 --> 01:53:31.234
TALIESIN: I'm so glad to be out of that bloody
city.

01:53:31.234 --> 01:53:35.602
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too, I guess. I just am excited
to see more, you know.

01:53:35.602 --> 01:53:36.824
TALIESIN: It's nice to be on the road again.

01:53:36.824 --> 01:53:38.817
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's nice to be on the road.

01:53:38.817 --> 01:53:40.151
TALIESIN: I've never been up this way before.

01:53:40.151 --> 01:53:41.162
ASHLEY: You haven't?

01:53:41.162 --> 01:53:43.918
TALIESIN: Not that I can remember. Not that I
know.

01:53:43.918 --> 01:53:46.036
ASHLEY: That's true.

01:53:46.036 --> 01:53:53.567
(laughter)

01:53:53.567 --> 01:53:56.661
ASHLEY: If I look around, are there flowers
anywhere?

01:53:56.661 --> 01:53:59.524
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:53:59.524 --> 01:54:01.514
TALIESIN: You haven't done that before.

01:54:02.555 --> 01:54:10.903
ASHLEY: Where's investigation? Oh, eight.

01:54:10.903 --> 01:54:14.360
MATT: It takes you a little while. You start
getting a little nervous, because Yasha just

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:17.456
vanishes in the darkness, saying, "I'll be right
back," and is gone for like 40 minutes.

01:54:17.456 --> 01:54:21.221
TALIESIN: Well, she's going to be gone for another
six days now.

01:54:21.221 --> 01:54:23.121
LIAM: I found poison oak, you guys!

01:54:23.121 --> 01:54:28.397
MATT: You do come back with a handful of small
posies. They're nothing special, but they're flowers.

01:54:28.397 --> 01:54:37.453
ASHLEY: I found some of these. I'm going to put
them in my book. I've gotten a lot

01:54:37.453 --> 01:54:41.133
of different ones now.

01:54:41.133 --> 01:54:42.977
TALIESIN: That's lovely.

01:54:42.977 --> 01:54:56.139
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm going to save them. I'm getting
quite the collection.

01:54:56.139 --> 01:55:00.696
LAURA: Then I'm going to crumple them up!

01:55:00.696 --> 01:55:02.847
MATT: You guys finish your watch. Who's taking the
next watch?

01:55:02.847 --> 01:55:03.524
SAM: We will.

01:55:03.524 --> 01:55:04.317
LIAM: I got it.

01:55:04.317 --> 01:55:06.736
LAURA: Never mind.

01:55:06.736 --> 01:55:08.560
MATT: All right. Nott and Caleb. Who's taking
point on this?

01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:09.712
LIAM: I am.

01:55:09.712 --> 01:55:10.797
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

01:55:10.797 --> 01:55:12.260
SAM: But you can't see in the dark.

01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:13.854
LIAM: I have (popping noises)

01:55:13.854 --> 01:55:15.167
SAM: Oh yeah.

01:55:15.167 --> 01:55:16.322
LIAM: With advantage or straight?

01:55:16.322 --> 01:55:17.904
SAM: I will aid.

01:55:17.904 --> 01:55:19.540
MATT: This would be a straight roll for you.

01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:20.521
LIAM: Straight roll.

01:55:20.521 --> 01:55:22.889
MATT: The lanterns, they're helping you see the
close vicinity.

01:55:22.889 --> 01:55:24.499
LIAM: I will still do it.

01:55:24.499 --> 01:55:28.411
MATT: I'll say sure. How far can the lights go
out? What's the range?

01:55:28.411 --> 01:55:34.329
LIAM: Oh, I think it's 60 feet? I bet that's
wrong. It is 120 feet.

01:55:34.329 --> 01:55:36.401
MATT: Yeah, so roll with advantage.

01:55:36.401 --> 01:55:44.115
LIAM: Ok, I'll roll the twins. Hey, really good.
That's a 22.

01:55:44.115 --> 01:55:55.632
MATT: 22? Nice. You guys are sitting there for a
bit, enjoying the time by the fire, conversing.

01:55:55.632 --> 01:56:02.100
Caleb, you're keeping an eye out beyond the
various tree trunks. You hear the snapping of a

01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:08.862
twig and you see some shifting of shadow.

01:56:08.862 --> 01:56:10.346
LIAM: Nott, there's something.

01:56:10.346 --> 01:56:11.320
SAM: Hmm, what?

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.387
LIAM: Something.

01:56:12.387 --> 01:56:13.526
SAM: What is it?

01:56:13.526 --> 01:56:14.901
MATT: A few things.

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.144
LIAM: Whack!

01:56:16.144 --> 01:56:17.330
MARISHA: Ow.

01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:18.634
SAM: Which direction? Point to it.

01:56:18.634 --> 01:56:19.689
LIAM: I just smack Beau and then--

01:56:19.689 --> 01:56:27.924
SAM: Oh, shit. Are they all on one? Do I see
anything?

01:56:27.924 --> 01:56:31.231
MATT: As you glance around and he's pointing this
out and you begin to come to consciousness--

01:56:31.231 --> 01:56:32.745
LIAM: I cast Mage Armor.

01:56:32.745 --> 01:56:34.678
MARISHA: (whispered) Jester!

01:56:34.678 --> 01:56:35.899
LAURA: What?

01:56:35.899 --> 01:56:37.303
MARISHA: Shh!

01:56:37.303 --> 01:56:41.324
MATT: At that moment, as soon as you finish
casting Mage Armor, there's a little flash of

01:56:41.324 --> 01:56:51.415
arcane energy and two arrows come shooting out of
the shadows, right towards you. Natural 20 and a

01:56:51.415 --> 01:56:56.395
six, which would bring it to ten.

01:56:56.395 --> 01:56:58.401
LIAM: The second does not hit, but the first one
obviously does.

01:56:58.401 --> 01:57:06.792
MATT: All right. You suffer five points of
piercing damage as the arrow catches you right in

01:57:06.792 --> 01:57:10.552
the left pectoral muscle, and I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

01:57:10.552 --> 01:57:14.354
MARISHA: What was that?

01:57:14.354 --> 01:57:16.167
TRAVIS: Poison arrow.

01:57:16.167 --> 01:57:17.765
LAURA: Or a sleep arrow.

01:57:17.765 --> 01:57:21.474
SAM: Or a health cure arrow.

01:57:21.474 --> 01:57:25.707
LIAM: Not great. Ten.

01:57:25.707 --> 01:57:30.505
MATT: You feel this burst of poison begin to pulse
through your veins. You are considered poisoned.

01:57:30.505 --> 01:57:34.325
As you guys all see this happen, you glance around
and you can see a bunch of small shapes beginning

01:57:34.325 --> 01:57:41.452
to skitter from around some of the trees. This
growling sound, almost barking sound. There's a

01:57:41.452 --> 01:57:48.707
few strange, furred wolves emerging from one side,
two or three of them, their eyes glistening as the

01:57:48.707 --> 01:57:53.549
light from the fire manages to catch it from an
angle. Behind them, these two heavy forms begin to

01:57:53.549 --> 01:58:07.940
emerge, and one of them goes, "Oh no! They've
awakened! Gonah!" "I know, Emmett!" And we'll come

01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:11.363
back to roll initiative here as we're going to
take a quick break.

01:58:11.363 --> 01:58:14.726
MARISHA: The break? Okay. That felt like the end
for some reason.

01:58:14.726 --> 01:58:16.116
ASHLEY: It did! I got panicked.

01:58:16.116 --> 01:58:17.455
MARISHA: No cliffhanger!

01:58:17.455 --> 01:58:21.528
MATT: No. We have a water break. We'll come back
on that and roll initiative.

01:58:21.528 --> 01:58:23.834
MARISHA: Oh my god!

01:58:23.834 --> 01:58:29.562
MATT: As your guys' campfire caught someone's
attention. For our Wyrmwood giveaway tonight--

01:58:29.562 --> 01:58:33.858
LIAM: Shit! I wanted to talk to Nott!

01:58:33.858 --> 01:58:37.952
SAM: Never going to happen.

01:58:37.952 --> 01:58:40.122
MARISHA: So I was thinking (grunts)

01:58:40.122 --> 01:58:46.021
MATT: Tonight we're giving out our fantastic
ziricote dice tray from our friends at Wyrmwood.

01:58:46.021 --> 01:58:47.661
MARISHA: Oh, that's sexy.

01:58:47.661 --> 01:58:48.995
LIAM: Matt's wood.

01:58:48.995 --> 01:58:52.751
MATT: I'm pretty sure, yeah. This is the wood that
I use on mine. Very slick. Tonight's keyword is

01:58:52.751 --> 01:58:59.812
"memories." If you want to, come into the Twitch
chat. Enter the phrase once. More than once and

01:58:59.812 --> 01:59:03.732
you'll be disqualified and, unfortunately, it's
only available to friends in the U.S. and Canada

01:59:03.732 --> 01:59:07.479
except for Quebec. But we'll come back with the
winner here at the end of the break.

01:59:07.479 --> 01:59:11.289
MARISHA: And stay tuned because during the break,
we're going to play the first episode of Key

01:59:11.289 --> 01:59:19.016
Question, because it's Deadpool related, and
Deadpool's tomorrow. It's an edited version

01:59:19.016 --> 01:59:24.655
because it's a long episode but you get a sample.
Okay bye.

01:59:24.655 --> 01:59:28.158
MATT: Thank you. We'll see you back here in a few
minutes.

01:59:28.158 --> 02:19:18.839
[break]

02:19:18.931 --> 02:19:26.024
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. That was all right.
Before we jump in, we do have a winner from the

02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:32.540
break for our fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway. The
winner is Brian Spinkicker! Brian Spinkicker,

02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:39.755
congratulations. We'll get that out to you ASAP.
Congrats to you, my friend. Exactly. I guess I

02:19:39.755 --> 02:19:41.313
should bring out the map.

02:19:41.313 --> 02:19:43.036
TRAVIS: Bring it out!

02:19:43.036 --> 02:19:49.440
LAURA: At least we got a surprise attack. That's
good.

02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:56.497
SAM: Anyway Caleb, this is what happened to me
as-- Oh no!

02:19:56.497 --> 02:19:59.830
LAURA: Oh my god, they're huge!

02:19:59.830 --> 02:20:01.730
LIAM: There's big people. There's little people.

02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:13.416
MATT: Glancing around, you see a cluster of
goblin-like creatures coming out of the nearby

02:20:13.416 --> 02:20:16.907
forest, helmed by two large ogres that are yelling
across the way.

02:20:16.907 --> 02:20:18.657
SAM: You said goblin-<i>like</i> creatures.

02:20:18.657 --> 02:20:24.350
MATT: It is very shadowy and dark. You can't even
see. A cluster of wolves also are circling from

02:20:24.350 --> 02:20:25.650
that side.

02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:28.727
LAURA: Wolves? Goblins? Oh shit balls.

02:20:28.727 --> 02:20:34.921
MATT: I did not have the cart and horses with me,
I thought I did and I left them at home. We'll say

02:20:34.921 --> 02:20:38.739
that they got spooked after the arrows were fired
and are off the side of it.

02:20:38.739 --> 02:20:40.132
SAM: Nice improv!

02:20:40.132 --> 02:20:45.161
MATT: To that note, everyone, I need you to roll
initiative.

02:20:45.161 --> 02:20:48.056
Oh my god.

02:20:48.056 --> 02:20:49.756
MARISHA: Here we go!

02:20:49.791 --> 02:20:52.250
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (chanting) Level five!

02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:56.360
MARISHA: Natural 20!

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:57.739
MATT: Oh shit!

02:20:57.739 --> 02:20:59.362
SAM: You're asleep, though.

02:20:59.362 --> 02:21:07.947
MATT: I-- (concerned sound) Okay. All right, to
that note, friends: 25 to 20?

02:21:07.947 --> 02:21:17.766
MARISHA: 24! A natural 20 on the most useless
category. Not a useless category, but in terms of

02:21:17.766 --> 02:21:24.319
a Nat 20, meh. But exciting! I don't want to shit
on it!

02:21:24.319 --> 02:21:26.551
LAURA: You don't want to curse it, right.

02:21:26.551 --> 02:21:27.569
MARISHA: I'm not cursing!

02:21:27.569 --> 02:21:28.682
MATT: 20 to 15?

02:21:28.682 --> 02:21:29.524
LIAM: 18.

02:21:29.524 --> 02:21:30.276
TRAVIS: 17.

02:21:30.276 --> 02:21:31.044
TALIESIN: 16.

02:21:31.044 --> 02:21:33.275
TRAVIS: Caleb, Fjord, Molly.

02:21:33.275 --> 02:21:42.286
ASHLEY: It's really what I do best, guys. It's my
most consistent thing that I do is roll shit

02:21:42.286 --> 02:21:43.311
initiative.

02:21:43.311 --> 02:21:44.613
TRAVIS: Through both campaigns.

02:21:44.613 --> 02:21:47.531
ASHLEY: In life and in-- Yeah, always.

02:21:47.531 --> 02:21:51.637
MATT: 15 to ten?

02:21:51.637 --> 02:21:53.605
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:21:53.605 --> 02:21:55.100
MATT: Wow. Ten to five?

02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:56.775
ASHLEY: Six!

02:21:56.775 --> 02:22:00.393
SAM: Oh wait, I never said mine. 15. Sorry.

02:22:00.393 --> 02:22:03.854
LAURA: I was expecting another six.

02:22:03.854 --> 02:22:06.858
SAM: Wait, what'd you have Molly?

02:22:06.858 --> 02:22:09.321
TALIESIN: I had 16.

02:22:09.321 --> 02:22:10.526
SAM: Okay.

02:22:10.526 --> 02:22:21.205
MATT: Jester and Yasha at the same time. Top of
the combat round, after the arrows were fired and

02:22:21.205 --> 02:22:25.539
Caleb is wincing and pulling back from the blow.
As these creatures begin to come out of the

02:22:25.539 --> 02:22:30.263
shadows, preparing for their continuation of their
assault, Beau, you're up first.

02:22:30.263 --> 02:22:34.892
MARISHA: Oh Jesus. Oh boy. Where am I?

02:22:34.892 --> 02:22:38.763
MATT: You're right there. Caleb nudged you awake.

02:22:38.763 --> 02:22:50.144
MARISHA: I wake up and I go: Fight Club! I run
towards whatever I see first. Do I see the wolf?

02:22:50.144 --> 02:22:51.643
Do I see the goblins?

02:22:51.643 --> 02:22:56.532
MATT: Looking this way, as he nudged you, you see the
wolves, these goblin creatures here, and this

02:22:56.632 --> 02:23:02.457
large, looming ogre that was shouting across the
way to the other ogre, who's now pushing past the

02:23:02.457 --> 02:23:04.217
tree and coming into view.

02:23:04.217 --> 02:23:10.568
MARISHA: Beau, in her hazy boss phase, goes: Ogres
are the leaders. And she runs straight for the ogre.

02:23:10.568 --> 02:23:16.349
MATT: As you dart past, it'll put you right
there.

02:23:16.349 --> 02:23:22.388
MARISHA: I'm going to unleash a round of attacks.
Two attacks.

02:23:22.388 --> 02:23:26.658
MATT: As you rush up, grabbing your staff from the
ground, getting the sleep from your face, you run

02:23:26.658 --> 02:23:28.037
towards it. Swing!

02:23:28.037 --> 02:23:31.432
MARISHA: The first attack is a ten?

02:23:31.432 --> 02:23:32.871
MATT: Ten misses.

02:23:32.871 --> 02:23:34.704
MARISHA: No, and the second attack also misses.

02:23:34.704 --> 02:23:39.022
MATT: Both first strikes attack. That's your
attack action.

02:23:39.022 --> 02:23:45.570
MARISHA: Those are both my attack actions. I'm
going to use a ki point to go into Patient Defense

02:23:45.687 --> 02:23:48.145
at that point because that sucked.

02:23:48.145 --> 02:23:52.411
MATT: You swing twice. You're still groggy from
being woken up and your blows go a bit wide. The

02:23:52.411 --> 02:23:56.280
ogre laughs as it palms away one of your strikes.

02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:59.053
MARISHA: I yawn and then go into a stance.

02:23:59.053 --> 02:24:04.346
MATT: As you get into a stance, you look down and
there's the wolf growling, its jaws open, its

02:24:04.346 --> 02:24:05.645
teeth exposed.

02:24:05.645 --> 02:24:11.308
MARISHA: I turn back to Jester and I go: Jester!
Puppies! Patient Defense.

02:24:11.308 --> 02:24:16.004
MATT: The goblins are taking their turn now. I
rolled really high on their initiative.

02:24:16.004 --> 02:24:17.398
LAURA: They are goblins!

02:24:17.398 --> 02:24:22.084
MATT: They are goblins, as now you've gotten a
moment to look. You see them in their greenish

02:24:22.084 --> 02:24:28.641
skin. They're wearing bits of cobbled-together
leather and hide and pelts of whatever they've

02:24:28.641 --> 02:24:34.641
scavenged around. They have bits of red and purple
paint smeared on their face in some war paint

02:24:34.641 --> 02:24:40.188
style. They're all like (goblin sounds). You,
speaking Goblin, know that they're essentially

02:24:40.188 --> 02:24:45.624
shouting commands. "Don't engage! Pull back and
fire!" They're all keeping their distance, at this

02:24:45.624 --> 02:24:51.742
point, this close up to fire, they're starting to
back away and rotate, firing volleys of arrows

02:24:51.742 --> 02:25:00.040
again towards everybody in the center. That's
going to be two against Caleb, one against Nott,

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:12.604
two against Yasha, two against Jester, and two
against Fjord. Actually, it should be only one

02:25:12.604 --> 02:25:23.186
against Fjord, because there's only eight goblins.
Yeah, so two against Caleb. That's cocked. That's

02:25:23.186 --> 02:25:24.809
going to be a 12?

02:25:24.809 --> 02:25:26.349
LIAM: 12 does not hit.

02:25:26.349 --> 02:25:27.511
MATT: And a six.

02:25:27.511 --> 02:25:28.523
LIAM: Does not hit!

02:25:28.523 --> 02:25:31.880
MATT: Okay, both miss. Both deflecting off of the
Mage Armor you put up before.

02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:33.921
LIAM: (vomiting)

02:25:33.921 --> 02:25:38.279
MATT: That's going to be one against Nott. It's
going to be an eight.

02:25:38.279 --> 02:25:39.114
SAM: Miss.

02:25:39.114 --> 02:25:43.267
MATT: You duck out of the way and it goes
vanishing into the darkness beyond. That's going

02:25:43.267 --> 02:25:56.476
to be two against Yasha. That's going to be a
nine? And a 23?

02:25:56.476 --> 02:25:57.741
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:25:57.741 --> 02:26:02.037
MATT: You take four points of piercing damage and
you need to make a constitution saving throw.

02:26:02.037 --> 02:26:03.238
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

02:26:03.238 --> 02:26:05.724
ASHLEY: How many points of damage did you say? I'm
sorry?

02:26:05.724 --> 02:26:09.761
MATT: Four points of piercing damage, and make a
constitution saving throw.

02:26:09.761 --> 02:26:12.028
SAM: Oh that's right, from the first shot.

02:26:12.028 --> 02:26:13.701
LIAM: There's an arrow sticking out of my ribs.

02:26:13.701 --> 02:26:17.881
ASHLEY: 22.

02:26:17.881 --> 02:26:22.453
MATT: 22. The arrow hits you, and you feel the
poison pulse through. You flex and grit your

02:26:22.453 --> 02:26:27.911
teeth, and your body manages to prevent the poison
from taking root into your system.

02:26:27.911 --> 02:26:34.191
ASHLEY: Oh shit, sorry! I was just trying to--
That's how I get rid of the poison. (airy fart)

02:26:34.191 --> 02:26:44.503
MATT: That's going to be two to Jester. That's
going to be a 14? And a 19!

02:26:44.503 --> 02:26:48.536
LAURA: As I'm lifting my shield, the other one
gets underneath it.

02:26:48.536 --> 02:26:52.737
MATT: That's five points of piercing damage to
you. Make a constitution saving throw.

02:26:52.737 --> 02:26:56.818
LAURA: Oh no! Natural 20!

02:26:56.818 --> 02:27:01.444
MATT: Natural 20. You manage to shrug off the
venom of these arrow strikes. One against you, Fjord.

02:27:01.444 --> 02:27:04.451
That's going to be a 15.

02:27:04.451 --> 02:27:05.387
TRAVIS: Misses.

02:27:05.387 --> 02:27:09.209
MATT: Misses. As you have your shield now.

02:27:09.209 --> 02:27:11.258
LAURA: Did I take damage from that one arrow?

02:27:11.258 --> 02:27:17.743
MATT: You did. You took five points of piercing
damage. Just splinters across it. With that, they

02:27:17.743 --> 02:27:24.377
all begin to dart back behind cover. This one
vanishes over here. This one's going to dart over

02:27:24.377 --> 02:27:33.973
to this space there. This darts behind here. They
both vanish behind the tree there. They all just

02:27:33.973 --> 02:27:39.200
dash into the shadows and vanish behind the
various trees around you. That finishes the round.

02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:41.036
Caleb, you're up with Fjord on deck.

02:27:41.036 --> 02:27:46.923
LIAM: I'm going to push through the pain in my
veins and reach into my satchel and smear molasses

02:27:46.923 --> 02:27:57.114
on my hand. I'm going to cast Slow on this batch
here. They have to make a wisdom save against my DC.

02:27:57.114 --> 02:27:58.895
MATT: All righty.

02:27:58.895 --> 02:28:05.202
MARISHA: That's some southern shit. Get the
molasses out your ass!

02:28:05.202 --> 02:28:06.843
MATT: Wisdom save.

02:28:06.843 --> 02:28:08.390
LIAM: 16 is the DC.

02:28:08.390 --> 02:28:17.665
MATT: 16 is the DC! All right. For that ogre over
there, that's a failure. He's going to be slow.

02:28:17.665 --> 02:28:23.709
LIAM: Speed is halved. Takes negative two to AC and
dexterity saving throws. Can't use reactions. On

02:28:23.709 --> 02:28:27.991
its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus
action, not both.

02:28:27.991 --> 02:28:39.595
MATT: All right. Then the other goblins there.
That's an 18. It succeeds. That one there. That's

02:28:39.595 --> 02:28:43.479
another 18! Two in a row! Sorry about that.

02:28:43.479 --> 02:28:52.844
LIAM: That's okay. I'm going to use my movement to
get closer into the fire. Maybe over towards Molly

02:28:52.844 --> 02:28:53.872
and Yasha.

02:28:53.872 --> 02:28:54.743
MATT: Right there?

02:28:54.743 --> 02:28:55.675
LIAM: Yeah.

02:28:55.675 --> 02:29:00.283
MATT: All righty. You are maintaining Slow
concentration on him.

02:29:00.283 --> 02:29:03.126
TALIESIN: Do you roll a save against poison, or
no?

02:29:03.126 --> 02:29:05.171
MATT: No, he's just poisoned.

02:29:05.171 --> 02:29:06.159
TRAVIS: What'd you cast on the big guy?

02:29:06.159 --> 02:29:07.300
LIAM: Slow.

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:16.001
MATT: That being the case, that finishes up
Caleb's turn. Fjord, you're up with Molly on deck.

02:29:16.001 --> 02:29:24.181
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my bonus action to cast
Hexblade's Curse on the big ol' fellow that Caleb

02:29:24.181 --> 02:29:25.331
pointed at.

02:29:25.331 --> 02:29:33.370
MATT: As you suddenly watch him, already a
sluggish creature, moving at an even more sluggish

02:29:33.370 --> 02:29:37.871
pace, the shadows around, all of a sudden, jump
off of the nearby tree trunks and cling to the

02:29:37.871 --> 02:29:43.560
interior of its form, around where the nooks and
crannies are. Almost like a small-scale Venom

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:44.903
symbiote at times.

02:29:44.903 --> 02:29:50.146
TRAVIS: I use my 30 feet of speed to run this way,
southeast.

02:29:50.146 --> 02:29:52.147
MATT: Southeast. Around this way, or this way?

02:29:52.147 --> 02:29:55.994
TRAVIS: Between these two trees, if I can. Towards
this direction.

02:29:55.994 --> 02:29:58.331
MATT: Okay. That's ten. 15. 20. 25.

02:29:58.331 --> 02:30:00.184
TRAVIS: Can I get within melee of this guy?

02:30:00.184 --> 02:30:04.000
MATT: You do get past this guy, who does get
an attack of opportunity on you, if you'd like.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.912
TRAVIS: Oh really? Five, ten, 15, 20.

02:30:08.912 --> 02:30:11.171
SAM: Take it!

02:30:11.171 --> 02:30:15.112
TRAVIS: No. I'm going to come this way, over here,
if I can.

02:30:15.112 --> 02:30:18.864
MATT: Okay. Five. Ten. 15. 20. 25. 30.

02:30:18.864 --> 02:30:19.795
TRAVIS: Great.

02:30:19.795 --> 02:30:20.828
MATT: That's where you get, there.

02:30:20.828 --> 02:30:28.069
TRAVIS: I will use Eldritch Blast against those
two goblins hiding behind the tree.

02:30:28.158 --> 02:30:32.870
MATT: Right there? As you rush past, you spin
around with the sword and shield in one hand. I

02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:34.284
mean, you haven't drawn your falchion yet.

02:30:34.284 --> 02:30:35.275
TRAVIS: I haven't pulled it yet.

02:30:35.275 --> 02:30:37.366
MATT: Yeah, so you just spin around, releasing
from your grip--

02:30:37.366 --> 02:30:40.339
TRAVIS: I now have two bursts of Eldritch Blast.

02:30:40.339 --> 02:30:41.889
MATT: You do. One attack for each.

02:30:41.889 --> 02:30:44.596
TRAVIS: That's a 12 for the first one?

02:30:44.596 --> 02:30:45.947
MATT: That does not hit.

02:30:45.947 --> 02:30:48.032
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:30:48.032 --> 02:30:51.947
MATT: The second one hits! The first one, the
goblin has a shield affixed to its wall and it

02:30:51.947 --> 02:30:56.551
knocks it out of the way. The Eldritch Blast just
poofs without any sort of impact. The second one

02:30:56.582 --> 02:30:59.276
does hit the other-- it poops!

02:30:59.276 --> 02:31:07.210
TRAVIS: That's four plus four is eight, plus four
is 12. 12 points of damage.

02:31:07.210 --> 02:31:11.774
MATT: The other goblin goes flying back about five
or six feet, tumbles to the ground, and is not

02:31:11.774 --> 02:31:12.853
moving.

02:31:12.853 --> 02:31:15.462
TRAVIS: Nice. That completes my turn.

02:31:15.462 --> 02:31:18.014
MATT: Finishing Fjord's turn. Molly, you're up.

02:31:18.014 --> 02:31:27.739
TALIESIN: I'm going to run directly at the
creature right there. On the way, I'm going to use

02:31:27.739 --> 02:31:34.225
my bonus action to start one of my scimitars. I
think I get two attacks with that scimitar, then.

02:31:34.225 --> 02:31:36.428
MATT: You do. Is this with your Rite of the Dawn?

02:31:36.428 --> 02:31:37.466
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:31:37.466 --> 02:31:44.223
MATT: The scimitar gleams with this faint,
glowing, radiant energy, this luminescent glow to

02:31:44.223 --> 02:31:48.507
the blade as he swings towards the singular
goblin. Make your attacks, if you'd like.

02:31:48.507 --> 02:32:00.568
TALIESIN: Setting my new max HP. All right! Attack
number one is 16 to hit?

02:32:00.568 --> 02:32:01.961
MATT: 16 hits!

02:32:01.961 --> 02:32:04.085
LAURA: 16 hits the goblin?

02:32:04.085 --> 02:32:05.216
MATT: Yep!

02:32:05.216 --> 02:32:07.866
TALIESIN: Just double checking, I'm still at a d4
for--

02:32:07.866 --> 02:32:09.413
MATT: Correct.

02:32:09.413 --> 02:32:16.330
TALIESIN: All right. That's (counting) 11 points
of damage.

02:32:16.330 --> 02:32:20.184
MATT: 11 points of damage. That'll do it. You rush
up and carve right through his torso.

02:32:20.184 --> 02:32:21.417
TALIESIN: Do I still have movement?

02:32:21.417 --> 02:32:22.361
MATT: You do.

02:32:22.361 --> 02:32:24.347
TALIESIN: I'm going to head around the tree for
the other one that--

02:32:24.347 --> 02:32:29.603
MATT: That's (counting) 30. You can get right up
behind with that goblin.

02:32:29.603 --> 02:32:31.210
TALIESIN: I'm going to take one shot at him.

02:32:31.210 --> 02:32:32.539
MATT: Go for it.

02:32:32.539 --> 02:32:34.818
TALIESIN: Ugh. Ten.

02:32:34.818 --> 02:32:39.905
MATT: As you swing towards it, it manages to take
a shield and deflect the blade, and your scimitar

02:32:39.905 --> 02:32:44.263
sticks into the side of the tree, and you have to
pull it forth and dislodge and prepare yourself

02:32:44.263 --> 02:32:45.209
for the next round.

02:32:45.209 --> 02:32:46.196
TALIESIN: All right.

02:32:46.196 --> 02:32:51.710
MATT: That finishes Molly's go. Now, the ogres
take their turn. This one right here, next to

02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:57.579
Beau, as you charged up and attempted to pummel
it, go in a defensive stance, (chuckles). He's going

02:32:57.579 --> 02:33:11.214
to make two greatclub swings towards you, with
disadvantage, because you have your-- Even with

02:33:11.214 --> 02:33:14.205
disadvantage, that is a 19 to hit? I rolled a 19
and a 13.

02:33:14.205 --> 02:33:15.354
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:33:15.354 --> 02:33:22.575
MATT: That hits. The second one, that is an 18 and
a 14.

02:33:22.575 --> 02:33:23.671
MARISHA: Okay, miss.

02:33:23.671 --> 02:33:30.072
MATT: The second one misses. The first one, as it
swings down towards you with heavy aggression.

02:33:30.072 --> 02:33:36.796
That is 13 points of bludgeoning damage as it
slams into you and you hit up against the tree. As

02:33:36.796 --> 02:33:40.753
you barely catch yourself and right, the second
swing goes through, and with that, you manage to

02:33:40.753 --> 02:33:44.521
pull underneath, your defensive stance ready to
go, and you jam the club into the tree. The tree

02:33:44.521 --> 02:33:50.363
actually shakes, sending a bunch of leaves and a
couple of birds scatter out from the inside as the

02:33:50.574 --> 02:33:52.192
ogre pulls the club back.

02:33:52.192 --> 02:33:53.489
MARISHA: 13, correct?

02:33:53.489 --> 02:34:03.654
MATT: Correct. With that, the ogre goes ahead
and-- Actually, he's just going to move over here,

02:34:03.654 --> 02:34:13.147
and is going to shout at the dogs, "Go! Carve
face!" The dogs get ready to pounce.

02:34:13.147 --> 02:34:14.860
MARISHA: Did they say carve face?

02:34:14.860 --> 02:34:15.888
SAM: Car face!

02:34:15.888 --> 02:34:17.025
MARISHA: Car face!

02:34:17.025 --> 02:34:19.139
MATT: Ogre only has 20 feet of movement.

02:34:19.139 --> 02:34:21.697
MARISHA: It's All Dogs Go to Heaven, you guys!

02:34:21.697 --> 02:34:25.201
LIAM: Is that half of his movement?

02:34:25.201 --> 02:34:26.169
MATT: Yep!

02:34:26.169 --> 02:34:27.310
LAURA: He has 40 movement?

02:34:27.310 --> 02:34:35.468
MATT: Yeah. He's like (heavy movement) (confused
grumbles). Not within distance, however, pulls a

02:34:35.468 --> 02:34:41.887
javelin out of a small pouch on the side and right
there, in immediate view, is the tiny goblin that,

02:34:41.887 --> 02:34:48.810
at the moment, the ogre thinks might be one of his
own. Instead, is going to assault the mage that

02:34:48.810 --> 02:34:54.815
affected him with the Slow spell and still,
throwing it slowly, it goes in your direction.

02:34:54.815 --> 02:34:56.308
It's the only action it takes, though.

02:34:56.308 --> 02:34:57.480
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:02.580
MATT: That is going to be a 23 to hit? Natural
17.

02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:05.682
LIAM: I'll take it because Shield won't match the
difference.

02:35:05.682 --> 02:35:11.699
MATT: That's the javelin, which does-- (pained
inhale)

02:35:11.699 --> 02:35:14.213
TRAVIS: Ooh, the in-suck is the worst!

02:35:14.213 --> 02:35:22.781
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage. The javelin
sinks into your stomach and embeds itself about

02:35:22.878 --> 02:35:26.770
four or five inches into your torso to the point
where the javelin's now holding itself out from

02:35:26.770 --> 02:35:32.004
your body. You immediately grab it, and the shock
hits you that it managed to drive itself so deep

02:35:32.004 --> 02:35:36.374
inside. You aren't even aware of the damage it's
done to your internals, it's put you in a state of

02:35:36.374 --> 02:35:42.559
shock. That's going to end that guy's turn, but it
gets to make a saving throw to try and resist the

02:35:42.559 --> 02:35:48.360
Slow spell. That is going to be 15.

02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:49.682
LIAM: No.

02:35:49.682 --> 02:35:56.333
MATT: Your spell DC is 16, yeah! It rolled a
natural 17, minus two. Not very wise, these guys,

02:35:56.333 --> 02:36:00.276
so he remains slow. However, I need you to make a
concentration check.

02:36:00.276 --> 02:36:02.265
MARISHA: Oh boy, roll high.

02:36:02.265 --> 02:36:06.625
LIAM: I did well. Concentration is-- I've never
done this before.

02:36:06.625 --> 02:36:07.776
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw.

02:36:07.776 --> 02:36:09.165
LIAM: That is a 19.

02:36:09.165 --> 02:36:14.346
MATT: You manage to maintain your Slow spell on
him, no issue. The ogre's turns are done. Nott,

02:36:14.346 --> 02:36:15.641
you're up.

02:36:15.641 --> 02:36:24.876
SAM: I yell to Caleb: Modern Literature! Then I
run towards these two goblins over here.

02:36:24.876 --> 02:36:26.319
MATT: Over this side?

02:36:26.319 --> 02:36:27.176
SAM: Yep.

02:36:27.176 --> 02:36:29.084
MATT: All right. 15, 20.

02:36:29.084 --> 02:36:35.282
SAM: I take out my hand crossbow and I point it
from the goblins to Caleb, and I fire.

02:36:35.282 --> 02:36:37.273
MATT: Okay.

02:36:37.273 --> 02:36:45.421
SAM: I'm aiming for the book strapped under his
armpit that only I know is under his clothes, and

02:36:45.421 --> 02:36:46.990
I rolled a natural 20.

02:36:46.990 --> 02:36:48.507
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh!

02:36:48.507 --> 02:36:51.159
MARISHA: That's good, right?

02:36:51.159 --> 02:36:56.476
MATT: It is. Essentially, because you're aiming
for such a small piece there, I was going to add

02:36:56.476 --> 02:37:03.592
five to the armor class, but a natural 20 hits. As
he's pulled back and clutching himself, you hit

02:37:03.592 --> 02:37:09.475
the book that's harnessed under his arm. You feel
the impact-- nope!

02:37:09.475 --> 02:37:11.678
LIAM: Oh, <i>Gottsverdammt!</i>

02:37:11.678 --> 02:37:13.471
SAM: He's going to play dead.

02:37:13.471 --> 02:37:21.606
MATT: You fall prone on the ground. I will ask you
to make another concentration check because you

02:37:21.606 --> 02:37:25.852
are averting your gaze and attention from the
creature you are focusing on.

02:37:25.852 --> 02:37:26.868
LIAM: Ten.

02:37:26.868 --> 02:37:29.043
MATT: Ten? You're fine. Ten is the DC you had to
hit.

02:37:29.043 --> 02:37:32.476
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. He's like this.

02:37:32.476 --> 02:37:34.107
MATT: Yeah, just out of the corner of his eye.

02:37:34.107 --> 02:37:35.369
TRAVIS: Mom coming into the room.

02:37:35.369 --> 02:37:37.415
LIAM: I'm looking through my eyelashes.

02:37:37.415 --> 02:37:41.984
MATT: I do need you to make a deception check, but
with advantage, because you managed to pull this

02:37:41.984 --> 02:37:44.729
off pretty well so far. This is just to convince
others.

02:37:44.729 --> 02:37:46.268
LIAM: Where's my Percy die?

02:37:46.268 --> 02:37:49.102
ASHLEY: What do you guys call this one? What do
you call this con?

02:37:49.102 --> 02:37:50.606
SAM: Modern Literature.

02:37:50.606 --> 02:37:56.955
LIAM: Deception, you say? It is an 18.

02:37:56.955 --> 02:38:00.512
MATT: 18? As far as they're concerned, Caleb is
dead.

02:38:00.512 --> 02:38:07.182
MARISHA: Whoa, that was sexy! You guys, we need
formations! We need code words!

02:38:07.182 --> 02:38:10.925
SAM: That was my bonus action. For my action, I
will tell the two goblins--

02:38:10.925 --> 02:38:14.824
MATT: Well, in order to do the bonus action
strike, you have to have attacked with your

02:38:14.824 --> 02:38:18.702
action. It's either two attacks or something
else.

02:38:18.702 --> 02:38:20.434
SAM: Now I have a bonus action?

02:38:20.434 --> 02:38:21.698
MATT: You have a bonus action, yes.

02:38:21.698 --> 02:38:22.721
SAM: Can I use it to talk?

02:38:22.721 --> 02:38:23.587
MATT: I'll say sure.

02:38:23.587 --> 02:38:30.107
SAM: Okay, so in Goblin, I'm going to say to them:
I'll hold them off! You get the loot with the

02:38:30.107 --> 02:38:31.425
horses!

02:38:31.425 --> 02:38:33.461
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:38:33.461 --> 02:38:34.997
SAM: It's in Goblin.

02:38:34.997 --> 02:38:36.331
MATT: Yeah, I know.

02:38:36.331 --> 02:38:40.263
SAM: 13?

02:38:40.263 --> 02:38:41.737
MATT: 13, okay.

02:38:41.737 --> 02:38:43.538
SAM: Wait, this is persuasion or deception?

02:38:43.538 --> 02:38:44.922
MATT: This would be deception.

02:38:44.922 --> 02:38:46.067
SAM: 13.

02:38:46.067 --> 02:38:52.199
MATT: Okay. They look at you, confused. One of
them looks over towards the horses. The other one

02:38:52.199 --> 02:38:56.708
seems to be holding his ground, but it looks like
one of them is in the moment of looking off to

02:38:56.708 --> 02:39:01.357
something else. That ends your turn. Jester and
Yasha, you guys are up.

02:39:01.357 --> 02:39:03.684
LAURA: (screaming) Caleb!

02:39:03.684 --> 02:39:11.149
MATT: Yeah. As far as you guys know, Nott just
turned on you with the rest of the goblins and

02:39:11.149 --> 02:39:12.736
shot down Caleb.

02:39:12.736 --> 02:39:18.094
LAURA: If I fucking waste one of my fucking
spells... Caleb! I rush over and I cast Cure

02:39:18.094 --> 02:39:22.017
Wounds at 2nd-level to heal Caleb.

02:39:22.017 --> 02:39:24.695
MATT: Okay, there you go. You move over, stepping
over the campfire.

02:39:24.695 --> 02:39:27.451
SAM: No! Don't save him!

02:39:27.451 --> 02:39:30.573
MARISHA: Laura, committing to RP! Yes!

02:39:30.573 --> 02:39:35.589
TRAVIS: No meta in this family, y'all. No meta in
this family. Not in this house!

02:39:35.589 --> 02:39:37.224
SAM: You're blowing it!

02:39:37.224 --> 02:39:39.317
TRAVIS: We won't have it!

02:39:39.317 --> 02:39:42.625
SAM: I should have told everyone the names of all
the set plays!

02:39:42.625 --> 02:39:57.748
LAURA: That would be 2d8 plus four. Oh, that's 12
plus eight, so 20 points of healing.

02:39:57.748 --> 02:40:02.579
MATT: You heal 20 hit points, Caleb. Do you
continue to play dead?

02:40:02.579 --> 02:40:04.194
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:40:04.194 --> 02:40:07.871
MATT: Okay. The spell doesn't have an effect on
Caleb.

02:40:07.871 --> 02:40:15.935
LAURA: (crying) It's not working! I don't know
what's going on! I'm going to use my bonus

02:40:15.935 --> 02:40:17.337
action--

02:40:17.337 --> 02:40:18.861
LIAM: But really, I'm up to full!

02:40:18.861 --> 02:40:22.547
ASHLEY: You're at full?

02:40:22.547 --> 02:40:24.522
LIAM: Yeah, because I have no hit points.

02:40:24.522 --> 02:40:29.316
LAURA: I'm going to use my bonus action to cast
Sacred Flame at the ogre that is attacking us.

02:40:29.316 --> 02:40:31.338
MATT: Sacred Flame is an action though, isn't it?

02:40:31.338 --> 02:40:35.752
LAURA: Oh, it is. I'm sorry, I was thinking,
because it's a cantrip-- you're right.

02:40:35.752 --> 02:40:36.988
MATT: That's okay.

02:40:36.988 --> 02:40:41.565
LAURA: Bonus action. There's not really anything I
can do, is there?

02:40:41.587 --> 02:40:45.126
MATT: You can move. You still have like 20 feet of
movement.

02:40:45.126 --> 02:40:52.068
LAURA: (tearily) I'm going to try to drag Caleb
away from the fire, behind Yasha.

02:40:52.068 --> 02:40:59.413
MATT: At half movement, you grab and start
dragging Caleb face down through the dirt to about

02:40:59.413 --> 02:41:05.621
there is as far as you can get him through rocks
and sticks. Twigs and shit are getting caught in

02:41:05.621 --> 02:41:06.563
your hair.

02:41:06.563 --> 02:41:08.088
LIAM: She's re-dirtying me for me!

02:41:08.088 --> 02:41:09.247
MATT: Yeah!

02:41:09.247 --> 02:41:10.958
MARISHA: (through clenched teeth) Stop it, stop!

02:41:10.958 --> 02:41:12.491
TRAVIS: (similarly) For fuck's sake!

02:41:12.491 --> 02:41:13.707
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

02:41:13.707 --> 02:41:15.632
TRAVIS: (high pitched) He's alive!

02:41:15.632 --> 02:41:21.445
MATT: That finishes Jester's turn. Yasha, what are
you doing?

02:41:21.445 --> 02:41:24.696
LIAM: This is what Dungeons &amp; Dragons is all
about.

02:41:24.696 --> 02:41:29.054
TRAVIS: Give me that pigeon any day, man. (coos)
He's alive!

02:41:29.054 --> 02:41:36.944
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to walk up to this guy.
I'll look back at Jester: I'll save us, it's okay.

02:41:36.944 --> 02:41:38.385
MATT: To this guy?

02:41:38.385 --> 02:41:40.582
ASHLEY: No, the other one, up here. Yeah.

02:41:40.582 --> 02:41:45.052
MATT: You step forward past there, and you get
right up into the grill of the slowed ogre.

02:41:45.052 --> 02:41:53.018
ASHLEY: I'm going to get really mad, and I'm going
to use Necrotic Shroud.

02:41:53.018 --> 02:41:55.705
SAM and TRAVIS: What is that?

02:41:55.705 --> 02:42:06.248
MATT: As you guys watch here, the campfire
suddenly dims. The flames flicker and cool to this

02:42:06.343 --> 02:42:14.078
low, orange glow from the vibrant yellow flame it
was before as Yasha steps past the flame. Behind

02:42:14.078 --> 02:42:22.271
the shawl, two large, skeletal, black wings emerge
from the back of her shoulder blades.

02:42:22.271 --> 02:42:24.183
SAM: Like real, or like see-through?

02:42:24.183 --> 02:42:29.342
ASHLEY: Can they see it? Because it's only if
you're within ten feet of the person.

02:42:29.342 --> 02:42:31.723
MATT: It has that effect, but it's still visible,
I'm pretty sure.

02:42:31.723 --> 02:42:33.972
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, I think you're right. The
effect is only--

02:42:33.972 --> 02:42:35.246
MATT: The effect is only within ten feet.

02:42:35.246 --> 02:42:37.250
SAM: Are they real, or are they see-through?

02:42:37.250 --> 02:42:46.894
MATT: You look at a somewhat translucent, skeletal
wing structure with membranous, undead-looking wings.

02:42:46.894 --> 02:42:49.115
TRAVIS: What the shit?

02:42:49.115 --> 02:42:56.654
MATT: As that happens, this dark energy emanates
from her body, and for a second, the white tips of

02:42:56.654 --> 02:43:02.337
her hair go completely black. As she steps
forward, striding, with her blade in her hands--

02:43:02.337 --> 02:43:13.576
TRAVIS: (electric guitar riff)

02:43:13.576 --> 02:43:23.545
MATT: Currently, Nott, you're the only one who can
see this, but her eyes go jet black. Entirely full

02:43:23.545 --> 02:43:32.448
darkness, a void of light where her eyes once were
as this happens and she strides forward. Charisma

02:43:32.448 --> 02:43:34.174
saving throw on his point, there.

02:43:34.174 --> 02:43:35.986
TRAVIS: On all of our points.

02:43:35.986 --> 02:43:41.190
MATT: Well, you're more than ten feet.
Unfortunately, he does succeed. However, you do

02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:44.427
manage to maintain the rest of your ability.

02:43:44.427 --> 02:43:49.899
ASHLEY: Okay, so now I have an attack, because of
Extra Attack?

02:43:49.899 --> 02:43:56.192
MATT: Yep, you have two attacks. Oh, no, this is
an action to do that, so no, you cannot attack

02:43:56.192 --> 02:43:57.259
this round.

02:43:57.259 --> 02:43:58.611
ASHLEY: Even the extra action?

02:43:58.611 --> 02:44:02.164
MATT: No, because you get two attacks for the
attack action. But that's your action.

02:44:02.164 --> 02:44:03.957
ASHLEY: Well, I'd like to rage.

02:44:03.957 --> 02:44:14.802
MATT: Yes, you may. As you step up to this ogre,
your wings unfurled, you give out this heavy Yasha

02:44:14.802 --> 02:44:20.891
roar that echoes in the space around you as your
wings flex out even further. This dark energy

02:44:20.891 --> 02:44:25.155
pulling in, and the ogre's like (confused
grunts)-- looking taken aback by this unexpected

02:44:25.155 --> 02:44:26.964
display of power.

02:44:26.964 --> 02:44:32.960
TRAVIS: We might need a mini for that, because
that sounds awesome. Holy shit.

02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:35.345
MATT: Going to have to look into that. Is that
your turn, Yasha?

02:44:35.345 --> 02:44:37.347
ASHLEY: Yeah, because I'm not going to move.

02:44:37.347 --> 02:44:39.295
MATT: All right, it is the wolves' turn.

02:44:39.295 --> 02:44:41.071
SAM: Wolves? Where are the wolves?

02:44:41.071 --> 02:44:42.423
TRAVIS: There's two wolves, right?

02:44:42.423 --> 02:44:49.196
MATT: There are three wolves. These wolves here,
watching you drag Caleb backward, all rush in to

02:44:49.196 --> 02:44:50.924
charge against you.

02:44:50.924 --> 02:44:52.192
LAURA: Great.

02:44:52.192 --> 02:44:53.359
MARISHA: Do I get a hit?

02:44:53.359 --> 02:44:56.025
MATT: No, because they moved outside of your range
there.

02:44:56.025 --> 02:44:57.439
MARISHA: He ran by me!

02:44:57.439 --> 02:44:58.580
MATT: This one does.

02:44:58.580 --> 02:44:59.470
MARISHA: Okay.

02:44:59.470 --> 02:45:05.703
MATT: You get one attack of opportunity against
that guy. Go ahead and roll for it. If you hit him

02:45:05.703 --> 02:45:07.260
he gets-- That's cocked.

02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:12.659
MARISHA: (disappointed) Okay. 12?

02:45:12.659 --> 02:45:14.853
MATT: 12 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:45:14.853 --> 02:45:17.679
MARISHA: As part of the Sentinel feat--

02:45:17.679 --> 02:45:19.101
MATT: He doesn't get to move.

02:45:19.101 --> 02:45:20.887
MARISHA: Hey-oh, 12 damage!

02:45:20.887 --> 02:45:23.166
MATT: 12 damage?

02:45:23.166 --> 02:45:24.723
MARISHA: Yes, I rolled an eight.

02:45:24.723 --> 02:45:30.474
MATT: As the wolf rushes from you, you crack down
with the staff. It yelps. It's still standing, but

02:45:30.474 --> 02:45:34.584
it's hurt really bad. It's limping and turns
around towards you with this heavy growl, this

02:45:34.584 --> 02:45:38.432
angry glare at you. It's going to attempt to
attack you with disadvantage, because you're still

02:45:38.432 --> 02:45:46.289
in your-- 18 and a 17 plus four, that's going to
be--

02:45:46.289 --> 02:45:47.921
MARISHA: 18 and a 17? It hits.

02:45:47.921 --> 02:45:53.543
MATT: I'm rolling really good, yeah. I know! It's
almost like I have a dice that lets me do that.

02:45:53.543 --> 02:45:55.725
TRAVIS: You son of a bitch!

02:45:55.725 --> 02:45:56.692
TALIESIN: I know.

02:45:56.692 --> 02:46:01.181
MATT: And double fours on the d4s. That will be
ten points of piercing damage, and I need you to

02:46:01.181 --> 02:46:02.513
make a strength saving throw.

02:46:02.513 --> 02:46:11.062
MARISHA: Hang on, one, two, three-- Oh god, hang
on. You know what, I'll come back to that. A

02:46:11.062 --> 02:46:12.190
strength saving throw.

02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:13.339
MATT: Yes.

02:46:13.339 --> 02:46:17.583
MARISHA: Okay! Thank you, Gil. 19.

02:46:17.583 --> 02:46:21.546
MATT: 19, okay. It does not knock you prone. As it
strikes you, it attempts to push you off your

02:46:21.579 --> 02:46:26.763
feet, and you resist it using your hand against
the tree to push yourself back up and get back

02:46:26.763 --> 02:46:28.109
into position.

02:46:28.109 --> 02:46:29.378
MARISHA: Bad dog!

02:46:29.378 --> 02:46:32.689
MATT: The two other ones, however, are going to go
against Jester, and because they have Pack

02:46:32.689 --> 02:46:35.875
Tactics, they both have advantage on their strikes
against you because they're coming at you from

02:46:35.875 --> 02:46:39.049
flanking you as a wolf. First one is going to
be--

02:46:39.049 --> 02:46:42.050
LAURA: Caleb, fucking me again!

02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:44.159
MATT: A 20, on the first one. Not a natural 20.

02:46:44.159 --> 02:46:45.558
LAURA: Natural 20?

02:46:45.558 --> 02:46:50.636
MATT: No. That's going to be double 19s on that
one, Jesus Christ! I'm rolling really good

02:46:50.636 --> 02:46:52.434
tonight! Both hit you.

02:46:52.434 --> 02:46:53.785
TRAVIS: So celebratory.

02:46:53.785 --> 02:47:01.927
MATT: I am. I'm excited. The first one is going to
be eight points of piercing damage, and the other

02:47:01.927 --> 02:47:06.214
one is going to be nine points of piercing damage.
I need you to make two strength saving throws.

02:47:06.214 --> 02:47:07.862
SAM: You're strong.

02:47:07.862 --> 02:47:12.077
LAURA: How much? Eight and nine?

02:47:12.077 --> 02:47:13.286
MATT: Yes.

02:47:13.286 --> 02:47:24.713
LAURA: That's 17. Wait, no, I think-- did I? No, I
did that wrong, didn't I? Shit balls. Anyway,

02:47:24.713 --> 02:47:26.018
strength saving throws?

02:47:26.018 --> 02:47:27.443
MATT: Yes, two of them, please.

02:47:27.443 --> 02:47:32.792
SAM: You got to close out of that to see the--

02:47:32.792 --> 02:47:40.209
LAURA: I got to close out of that. Okay, strength.
12 and 13.

02:47:40.209 --> 02:47:45.622
MATT: You manage to resist being knocked prone, as
they both begin jumping at you and clawing. One of

02:47:45.622 --> 02:47:48.922
them bites towards the back of your armor. You
throw it to the ground. You almost get knocked

02:47:48.922 --> 02:47:52.158
off, but you kept yourself there between the two
of them, standing, Caleb at your feet.

02:47:52.158 --> 02:47:55.913
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hellish Rebuke in
response to one of the--

02:47:55.913 --> 02:48:00.840
MATT: He's going to attempt to make a dexterity
saving throw. That's a natural four, nope. That's

02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:03.357
full damage on this wolf here.

02:48:03.357 --> 02:48:06.751
LAURA: That would be 15 points of damage to him.

02:48:06.751 --> 02:48:12.842
MATT: 15 points of damage. That wolf suddenly is
blasted in freezing cold energy as you yell in

02:48:12.842 --> 02:48:14.640
response to its assault.

02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:18.350
LAURA: You stay away, you piece of--! It's okay.

02:48:18.350 --> 02:48:23.883
MATT: As you pull back and look, the wolf is
frozen solid, and tumbles into a bunch of ice

02:48:23.883 --> 02:48:29.081
chunks. Off the battlefield. That ends the wolf's
turn. Top of the round: Beau, you're up.

02:48:29.081 --> 02:48:33.165
MARISHA: I'm going to unleash on this ogre in
front of me.

02:48:33.165 --> 02:48:34.197
MATT: Go for it.

02:48:34.197 --> 02:48:35.566
MARISHA: I have the ogre and the wolf, right?

02:48:35.566 --> 02:48:36.373
MATT: Yep.

02:48:36.373 --> 02:48:42.331
MARISHA: I'll do my first two attacks on the ogre.
Natural 18 on the first one, and the second one

02:48:42.331 --> 02:48:46.150
sucks at a four, with a ten total?

02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:48.399
MATT: That misses. The first one hits.

02:48:48.399 --> 02:48:53.969
MARISHA: Okay. Goddamn it, six damage.

02:48:53.969 --> 02:48:55.162
MATT: Six points of damage.

02:48:55.162 --> 02:48:59.665
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and do a Flurry of Blows
for my bonus.

02:48:59.665 --> 02:49:02.607
MATT: So you have two more strikes. Against the
ogre as well?

02:49:02.607 --> 02:49:09.991
MARISHA: Yeah, let's unleash into the ogre. Okay,
19?

02:49:09.991 --> 02:49:11.271
MATT: 19 hits.

02:49:11.271 --> 02:49:13.273
MARISHA: And 14?

02:49:13.273 --> 02:49:17.133
MATT: 14 also hits. Roll damage on both of those.
d4s on those.

02:49:17.133 --> 02:49:25.453
MARISHA: Okay, ten damage on the first, eight on
the second.

02:49:25.453 --> 02:49:34.873
MATT: Nice, 18 points of damage on it. That
finishes Beau's turn. It is now the goblins' go.

02:49:34.873 --> 02:49:37.911
LIAM: What happened to me? I haven't gone in a
while.

02:49:37.911 --> 02:49:39.582
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're next.

02:49:39.582 --> 02:49:44.761
MATT: You come after the goblins, don't worry.
You're coming. This one here, who's up against

02:49:44.761 --> 02:49:50.288
you, Molly, is going to throw the shortbow over
its shoulder, pull out its scimitar, and lash out

02:49:50.288 --> 02:49:54.837
towards you. That's going to be a 15 to hit?

02:49:54.837 --> 02:49:56.379
TALIESIN: AC is 15.

02:49:56.379 --> 02:50:04.781
MATT: That hits, then. You suffer five points of
slashing damage. It strikes across you, backs up,

02:50:04.781 --> 02:50:08.356
pulls its shield up, and is getting ready to
defend itself from whatever assault you bring back

02:50:08.356 --> 02:50:13.773
at it. It's going to stay right there, because
it's liking the tree cover to its side, but

02:50:13.773 --> 02:50:19.873
keeping an eye over its shoulder to Fjord, who
tried to fire at it previously. These two goblins

02:50:19.873 --> 02:50:28.085
are going to step out and they're going to both
fire at Fjord, who is advancing towards them. That

02:50:28.085 --> 02:50:29.866
is going to be a 20 to hit.

02:50:29.866 --> 02:50:30.907
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:50:30.907 --> 02:50:32.479
MATT: And a ten to hit.

02:50:32.479 --> 02:50:33.672
TRAVIS: Does not hit.

02:50:33.672 --> 02:50:37.764
MATT One arrow, the other manages to catch you in
the side of the neck and stick in, before it falls

02:50:37.764 --> 02:50:45.607
out of the wound. Not deep enough to stick you too
hard, but you do suffer eight points of piercing

02:50:45.607 --> 02:50:48.755
damage. That's max damage, and I need you to make
a constitution saving throw.

02:50:48.755 --> 02:50:52.049
TRAVIS: 24.

02:50:52.049 --> 02:50:56.482
MATT: You resist the poison, no issue. This one is
going to use the rest of its movement to dart

02:50:56.482 --> 02:51:04.870
behind there. This one's going to move behind
there. These two here that are along with Nott are

02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:11.237
going to ignore Nott. This one is going to start
moving this way towards where the cart ran off,

02:51:11.237 --> 02:51:18.327
and it's off the grid there. This one is going to
saunter up right next to Nott and make a shot at

02:51:18.327 --> 02:51:25.880
Yasha. That's a natural 17, so it's going to be 21
to hit. You are raging, though, so you take half

02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:30.617
damage. Which is good, that'd be seven points of
piercing damage reduced to three, so you take

02:51:30.617 --> 02:51:35.727
three points of piercing damage. You do have to
make a constitution saving throw. All of the

02:51:35.727 --> 02:51:38.488
arrows they have are dipped in some sort of a
toxin or venom.

02:51:38.488 --> 02:51:40.029
TALIESIN: What's the effect of the toxin or venom
again?

02:51:40.029 --> 02:51:43.464
MATT: It poisons. They get the poisoned
condition.

02:51:43.464 --> 02:51:46.024
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural one.

02:51:46.024 --> 02:51:51.062
MATT: With that, even in your form, the poison
begins to take hold, and where the wound catches

02:51:51.062 --> 02:51:55.753
you off the side of the throat and the back of the
head, the veins begin to pulse black as the poison

02:51:55.753 --> 02:51:57.396
begins to take hold. You are poisoned.

02:51:57.396 --> 02:51:59.006
LAURA: You're still really cool looking, though!

02:51:59.006 --> 02:52:01.105
MATT: You don't take any additional damage, but
currently all of your attacks are at

02:52:01.105 --> 02:52:02.284
disadvantage.

02:52:02.284 --> 02:52:03.541
MARISHA: It goes really well with the wings.

02:52:03.541 --> 02:52:05.229
MATT: It does, actually.

02:52:05.229 --> 02:52:08.759
LAURA: That's what poison does? You get
disadvantage on all your attacks if you're

02:52:08.759 --> 02:52:09.725
poisoned?

02:52:09.725 --> 02:52:11.163
MATT: Poisoned: Disadvantage on attack rolls and
ability checks.

02:52:11.163 --> 02:52:14.170
LAURA: That sucks.

02:52:14.170 --> 02:52:20.451
MATT: It's pretty rough. That ends that guy's
turn. There's one goblin back here. Seeing that

02:52:20.451 --> 02:52:25.299
Molly is currently engaged, it's going to rush up
behind and attempt to flank the back of him. It's

02:52:25.299 --> 02:52:29.260
going to make a strike with its scimitar, with
advantage because it's flanking you. That's

02:52:29.260 --> 02:52:35.886
cocked. Even its highest roll there is a seven
plus four, that's 11. It goes to strike and you

02:52:35.886 --> 02:52:39.480
see it coming, hearing the little footsteps behind
you, you duck out of the way as it strikes,

02:52:39.480 --> 02:52:46.441
hitting air, and now you're holding them off on
both sides. I think that's all of them that have

02:52:46.441 --> 02:52:52.144
gone, so that is going to lead us to Caleb.

02:52:52.144 --> 02:52:55.942
LIAM: I'm poisoned, so any attack rolls are at
disadvantage, correct?

02:52:55.942 --> 02:52:57.048
MATT: Correct.

02:52:57.048 --> 02:53:03.287
LIAM: I'm going to struggle to my feet, and I'm
going to cast Sleep over and away in that

02:53:03.287 --> 02:53:10.222
direction, so it falls way back behind the ogre
and these two wolves. The goal is to get the ogre

02:53:10.222 --> 02:53:13.696
and two wolves just on the edges of it, so it
doesn't hit any of my friends. I'm aiming far

02:53:13.696 --> 02:53:16.096
behind them to get them on the perimeter.

02:53:16.096 --> 02:53:17.092
MATT: To get these two here?

02:53:17.092 --> 02:53:23.283
LIAM: The wolves are the primary goal, stopping
short of Jester. They are the wall, the outer edge.

02:53:23.283 --> 02:53:34.873
MATT: Go ahead and roll the points for sleep. It's
not concentration, so you get to maintain Slow.

02:53:34.873 --> 02:53:38.242
TRAVIS: What does a 20-foot sphere look like on the
map? Four squares?

02:53:38.424 --> 02:53:40.433
MATT: 20-foot radius?

02:53:40.433 --> 02:53:44.370
TRAVIS: Yeah, 20-foot sphere. Jesus.

02:53:44.370 --> 02:53:45.984
MARISHA: That's fucking big.

02:53:45.984 --> 02:53:48.877
ASHLEY: Wait, did you get the little goblin back
there?

02:53:48.877 --> 02:53:50.156
MATT: The 20-foot radius sphere?

02:53:50.156 --> 02:53:51.926
TRAVIS: It just says 20-foot sphere.

02:53:51.926 --> 02:53:55.449
LIAM: Bad roll, 13 hit points total.

02:53:55.449 --> 02:54:03.390
MATT: 13 hit points total? This one falls
unconscious, that one stays up.

02:54:03.390 --> 02:54:04.929
TRAVIS: Area's 20 feet, so it should be--

02:54:04.929 --> 02:54:16.135
MATT: Ten foot radius, then. That would be there.
Half the size.

02:54:16.135 --> 02:54:21.150
LIAM: I got to standing, which would take half my
movement, so I'm going to use my last 15 feet to

02:54:21.150 --> 02:54:27.041
get exactly opposite to the other side of the wall
by sliding around it. And killing Jester.

02:54:27.041 --> 02:54:31.145
LAURA: You're alive! How did--

02:54:31.145 --> 02:54:33.426
LIAM: Haha, funny joke.

02:54:33.426 --> 02:54:37.234
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

02:54:37.234 --> 02:54:42.024
TRAVIS: I'll use my 30 feet to run towards this
goblin.

02:54:42.024 --> 02:54:45.918
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20.

02:54:45.918 --> 02:54:52.953
TRAVIS: Great, and I will use Booming Blade to
make a melee attack against him.

02:54:52.953 --> 02:54:54.336
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:54:54.336 --> 02:54:55.725
SAM: (Texas drawl) Booming Blade.

02:54:55.725 --> 02:55:01.838
MATT: As you draw your falchion out of the side,
you focus on it, and as you do so, this spark of

02:55:01.838 --> 02:55:06.614
electrical thunder energy engulfs the edge of it
as you strike downward.

02:55:06.614 --> 02:55:10.396
TRAVIS: That is 18 plus seven, 23.

02:55:10.396 --> 02:55:12.040
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:24.959
TRAVIS: It's a d8 plus the thunder damage. This is
the first time I've used it, I'm real excited.

02:55:24.959 --> 02:55:30.800
(counting)

02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:32.350
MATT: An additional 1d8.

02:55:32.350 --> 02:55:33.872
TRAVIS: Eight, so 18 points.

02:55:33.872 --> 02:55:39.860
MATT: 18 point of damage. With that, as you cut
down into the goblin, the blade sinks in partway

02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:45.620
through the torso, and then the burst causes it to
tear apart in two different directions, exploding,

02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:51.064
spattering across the tree and the side of the
ogre that's ten feet in front of you. Doesn't seem

02:55:51.064 --> 02:55:52.298
to notice.

02:55:52.298 --> 02:55:56.498
TRAVIS: With Booming Blade, is that just one of
my two attacks per action?

02:55:56.498 --> 02:56:00.026
MATT: No, it's an action to use the cantrip, then
you get an attack as part of it, so you have to

02:56:00.026 --> 02:56:03.457
decide between doing two attacks with your
invocation that you took, or--

02:56:03.457 --> 02:56:07.596
TRAVIS: Lesson learned, and I'll use the rest of
my action to get up on the back.

02:56:07.735 --> 02:56:08.954
MATT: Your movement?

02:56:08.954 --> 02:56:12.582
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sorry, the rest of my movement.
So that's 20, 25, 30.

02:56:12.582 --> 02:56:15.652
MATT: You're not quite flanking, you have to get
one more square to be flanking with Yasha, but

02:56:15.652 --> 02:56:17.846
Yasha can possibly move and make that flanking on
your turn, if you'd like.

02:56:17.846 --> 02:56:21.749
That ends Fjord's turn. Molly, you're up.

02:56:21.749 --> 02:56:23.147
SAM: Yeah, Mollymauk!

02:56:23.147 --> 02:56:32.593
TALIESIN: I'm going to get the one in front of me.
First attack, that's all right. That's 19 to hit.

02:56:32.593 --> 02:56:34.131
MATT: 19 hits, that works.

02:56:34.131 --> 02:56:40.188
TALIESIN: That's eight points of damage.

02:56:40.188 --> 02:56:44.180
MATT: Eight points of damage. As you carve
through, it cuts a giant gash down the front of

02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:48.115
its body to part of its thigh. It's wounded, very
badly, but still standing.

02:56:48.115 --> 02:56:50.173
SAM: What did you attack?

02:56:50.173 --> 02:56:52.105
MATT: Carved that goblin right there.

02:56:52.105 --> 02:56:57.605
TALIESIN: One more. 19 to hit.

02:56:57.605 --> 02:56:59.181
MATT: That'll hit.

02:56:59.181 --> 02:57:03.026
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage.

02:57:03.026 --> 02:57:07.807
MATT: What you do is, you strike once and it
sticks into his body, then as he's still living,

02:57:07.807 --> 02:57:12.259
you double down push, and force it the rest of the
way down, carving it in half, and it splits in

02:57:12.259 --> 02:57:14.813
half and is destroyed.

02:57:14.813 --> 02:57:24.214
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn around to the one
that's behind me. I'm going to take a third hit.

02:57:24.214 --> 02:57:27.667
MATT: Striking down overhand towards it behind
you.

02:57:27.667 --> 02:57:28.664
TALIESIN: 12.

02:57:28.664 --> 02:57:29.755
MATT: Total of 12?

02:57:29.755 --> 02:57:30.752
TALIESIN: Total of 12.

02:57:30.752 --> 02:57:33.991
MATT: Does not hit. He's ready for you, and the
shield catches your blade. It sticks into it for a

02:57:33.991 --> 02:57:37.527
second, and shoves it off with you.

02:57:37.527 --> 02:57:43.566
TALIESIN: That's everything. Well, I could move,
but no. I'm going to stay locked with

02:57:43.566 --> 02:57:47.680
this one then. No, I'm done.

02:57:47.836 --> 02:57:51.419
MATT: I forgot to attack with that other ogre last
turn, but that's okay. He was slowed, it's fine.

02:57:51.419 --> 02:57:58.563
Now the ogres go. This one is going to continue to
pummel you, as now you've pummeled it, so it gets

02:57:58.563 --> 02:57:59.951
two strikes against you.

02:57:59.951 --> 02:58:02.143
TALIESIN: I'm going to use-- disadvantage.

02:58:02.143 --> 02:58:03.954
MARISHA: Oh, thank you.

02:58:03.954 --> 02:58:05.070
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

02:58:05.070 --> 02:58:11.288
MATT: That's going to put him at a nine, so the
first strike misses. Are you going full amplified?

02:58:11.288 --> 02:58:13.185
The second strike also has disadvantage.

02:58:13.185 --> 02:58:14.477
TRAVIS: What is that called?

02:58:14.477 --> 02:58:15.764
SAM: Full amplify.

02:58:15.764 --> 02:58:17.485
MATT: That's going to be a 15.

02:58:17.485 --> 02:58:18.740
MARISHA: Whoa, miss.

02:58:18.740 --> 02:58:24.652
MATT: Both swings go wide as its eyes suddenly are
filled with blackened blood, and it can't see

02:58:24.874 --> 02:58:31.971
where you are. It hits the side of the tree and
the tree actually tumbles over onto the ground there.

02:58:31.971 --> 02:58:34.571
MARISHA: Firewood!

02:58:34.571 --> 02:58:40.811
MATT: The other ogre who's now in front of Yasha
as you approached it, it's caught off guard.

02:58:40.811 --> 02:58:45.637
"Smash scary thing!" It's going to take two
strikes towards you.

02:58:45.637 --> 02:58:47.039
TALIESIN: Isn't it still slowed?

02:58:47.039 --> 02:58:49.974
MATT: Yeah. It was one action as multiattack.

02:58:49.974 --> 02:58:51.338
TALIESIN: Oh, it's two. Okay.

02:58:51.338 --> 02:58:55.679
MATT: That's going to be a 14. What's your armor
class?

02:58:55.679 --> 02:58:56.685
ASHLEY: 14.

02:58:56.685 --> 02:58:59.613
LAURA: Whoa, we need to get you some AC.

02:58:59.613 --> 02:59:15.921
MATT: That's going to be a 13. Second one misses,
but the first one does hit. That is 17 points of

02:59:15.921 --> 02:59:23.394
bludgeoning damage, halved to eight. It's still
(grunting), it's like it's trying to push through

02:59:23.394 --> 02:59:29.222
molasses every time it strikes or swings at you.
It's going to attempt to shift around, not even

02:59:29.222 --> 02:59:34.060
noticing Fjord there at the moment, around this
way. Fjord, you do get an attack of opportunity

02:59:34.060 --> 02:59:35.052
against it.

02:59:35.052 --> 02:59:41.843
TRAVIS: I do. Amazing. That is 26 to hit.

02:59:41.843 --> 02:59:43.408
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:59:43.408 --> 02:59:48.113
TRAVIS: Is this considered a monstrosity or a
beast?

02:59:48.113 --> 02:59:51.665
MATT: It is not. It is considered technically a
giant.

02:59:51.665 --> 02:59:58.352
TRAVIS: Gotcha. 13 points of damage.

02:59:58.352 --> 03:00:03.506
MATT: Nice. That finishes your reaction on that.
Ogre's turn is done. Nott, you're up.

03:00:03.506 --> 03:00:10.699
SAM: Okay. I'll hold up the hand crossbow, point
it in Yasha's general vicinity, and say: I'll

03:00:10.699 --> 03:00:14.205
finish the job, sister! I will fire at the ogre.

03:00:14.205 --> 03:00:15.880
MATT: Okay.

03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:22.857
SAM: Oh no! Only a 13-- oh wait, no, it went up.
14.

03:00:22.857 --> 03:00:25.641
MATT: That hits. Ogre is a big target.

03:00:25.641 --> 03:00:28.216
SAM: Yeah. I think I get all the sneak attack?

03:00:28.216 --> 03:00:29.313
MATT: You do.

03:00:29.313 --> 03:00:31.021
SAM: Ugh.

03:00:31.021 --> 03:00:34.154
LAURA: I saw one that was good and I was like: Oh,
no.

03:00:34.154 --> 03:00:39.913
SAM: 15 plus Fury of the Small. 19.

03:00:39.913 --> 03:00:46.220
MATT: Ooh, nice! As it's looming around, it gets
struck by Fjord as it's trying to stomp around

03:00:46.354 --> 03:00:51.821
Yasha, trying to pull away from that situation.
You shoot towards the base of its skull and it

03:00:51.821 --> 03:00:58.356
sticks in and the left arm for a second goes numb
and it has to flex its muscle to snap the bolt in

03:00:58.356 --> 03:01:02.519
its neck, leaving part of it still lodged in the
base of its skull, but at least now it's got the

03:01:02.519 --> 03:01:07.855
use of its other arm back, and goes to clutch onto
the club, still moving slowly and sluggish with

03:01:07.855 --> 03:01:08.981
every movement.

03:01:08.981 --> 03:01:09.614
SAM: All right.

03:01:09.614 --> 03:01:13.768
MATT: That's your action?

03:01:13.768 --> 03:01:21.302
SAM: Yes, I'll say: Shit, I missed! Let me try
again! I'll reload and I'll go pop and shoot the

03:01:21.302 --> 03:01:22.687
goblin right next to me.

03:01:22.687 --> 03:01:23.527
MATT: Okay!

03:01:23.527 --> 03:01:27.088
(laughter)

03:01:27.088 --> 03:01:28.804
SAM: Oh no, I missed!

03:01:28.804 --> 03:01:31.317
MARISHA: That was so badass, though!

03:01:31.317 --> 03:01:34.243
MATT: As you do so, it was literally holding the
shield in front of it, and you just shoot the

03:01:34.243 --> 03:01:37.921
shield. (growl)

03:01:37.921 --> 03:01:39.248
MARISHA: Oh no!

03:01:39.248 --> 03:01:41.642
(laughter)

03:01:41.642 --> 03:01:45.334
TRAVIS: You're just teeth-to-teeth! (growl)

03:01:45.334 --> 03:01:47.189
MATT: That finishes your turn, Nott?

03:01:47.189 --> 03:01:50.376
SAM: I have movement, but if I move away-- no,
I'll just stick.

03:01:50.376 --> 03:01:55.004
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn. That
brings us to Jester and Yasha. Jester.

03:01:55.004 --> 03:01:58.661
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at the
wolf in front of me.

03:01:58.661 --> 03:02:02.749
MATT: Wisdom save for him. That's going to be--

03:02:02.749 --> 03:02:05.509
LAURA: It's dex. Sacred Flame.

03:02:05.509 --> 03:02:07.100
MATT: Right, dex. It's a 13.

03:02:07.100 --> 03:02:08.601
LAURA: Does not succeed.

03:02:08.601 --> 03:02:09.816
MATT: Roll damage.

03:02:09.816 --> 03:02:21.547
LAURA: 2d8. Oh, five damage to him. Dang it. Then
I'm going to cast, for my bonus action, Spiritual

03:02:21.547 --> 03:02:22.578
Weapon!

03:02:22.578 --> 03:02:23.799
MATT: Oh shit!

03:02:23.799 --> 03:02:26.420
SAM: Spiritual <i>Weap</i>!

03:02:26.420 --> 03:02:27.771
MATT: Where do you want to place it?

03:02:27.771 --> 03:02:32.758
LAURA: Here. Oh, you have one? I want it right in
front of me because I might as well have it crash

03:02:32.758 --> 03:02:34.002
down on the wolf as well!

03:02:34.002 --> 03:02:36.245
MATT: There you go. Roll for a strike on that
wolf.

03:02:36.245 --> 03:02:41.344
LAURA: Okay. That is 16.

03:02:41.344 --> 03:02:42.553
MATT: 16 hits!

03:02:42.553 --> 03:02:48.100
LAURA: That is a d8 plus four, that's nine points
of damage to the wolf.

03:02:48.100 --> 03:02:53.326
MATT: Nine points of damage to the wolf. It clubs
down-- (yelp) You watch as one of the shoulders

03:02:53.326 --> 03:02:57.830
breaks. It's barely standing. It's like
(groaning).

03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:58.978
LAURA: Damn it!

03:02:58.978 --> 03:03:00.208
MATT: Does that finish your turn?

03:03:00.208 --> 03:03:05.227
LAURA: Yeah, because I can't move; he'll attack
me. But he's going to attack me anyway!

03:03:05.227 --> 03:03:06.587
MATT: Up to you. What do you want to do?

03:03:06.587 --> 03:03:10.279
LAURA: He could attack Caleb, though. He'll
probably attack me. I'm going to stay right

03:03:10.279 --> 03:03:11.334
there.

03:03:11.334 --> 03:03:13.165
MATT: Okay. Yasha, what are you doing?

03:03:13.165 --> 03:03:20.907
ASHLEY: It's time. Okay. I'm going to attack the
giant, big thing.

03:03:20.907 --> 03:03:22.697
MATT: You have disadvantage because you are
poisoned still.

03:03:22.697 --> 03:03:23.790
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:03:23.790 --> 03:03:25.504
SAM: But she's raging.

03:03:25.504 --> 03:03:26.715
ASHLEY: Do I need to roll for it?

03:03:26.715 --> 03:03:29.916
MATT: You're raging, but you have to roll twice
and take the lower, unless you do reckless, in

03:03:29.916 --> 03:03:31.325
which case it will balance it.

03:03:31.325 --> 03:03:39.062
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, I'll do reckless, I'm sorry. I
didn't say that before I rolled, so I'm not going

03:03:39.062 --> 03:03:43.426
to do it. Okay. I roll it again.

03:03:43.426 --> 03:03:48.504
MATT: What was that first one? The first attack?

03:03:48.504 --> 03:03:49.994
ASHLEY: It was 16. The first one.

03:03:49.994 --> 03:03:51.763
MATT: 16 hits. Second one is?

03:03:51.763 --> 03:03:54.756
ASHLEY: 13.

03:03:54.756 --> 03:03:59.574
MATT: 13 still hits. It's a big target. Its AC is
lower because of the Slow spell. He's like

03:03:59.574 --> 03:04:04.087
super-easy to hit. His armor class is effectively
nine right now.

03:04:04.087 --> 03:04:05.196
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

03:04:05.196 --> 03:04:08.265
ASHLEY: Divine Fury.

03:04:08.265 --> 03:04:13.815
SAM: By the way, Matt, last round I should have
done 20 points of damage, not 19 because I'm level

03:04:13.815 --> 03:04:14.958
five now.

03:04:14.958 --> 03:04:16.272
MATT: That's true.

03:04:16.272 --> 03:04:23.781
ASHLEY: 23 for the first hit.

03:04:23.781 --> 03:04:26.572
MATT: 23 for the first hit? How do you want to do
this?

03:04:26.572 --> 03:04:29.054
(cheering)

03:04:29.054 --> 03:04:38.050
ASHLEY: Okay, I'd like to take out my blade, and
I'm going to put it up to his chest, and I'm going

03:04:38.050 --> 03:04:41.109
to grab him on the shoulder and I'm going to yank
him down the blade.

03:04:41.109 --> 03:04:43.507
(appreciative groaning)

03:04:43.507 --> 03:04:48.260
MATT: As you pull him over the blade, it pushes up
into the clavicle and up into the throat. It

03:04:48.260 --> 03:04:53.183
emerges, actually knocking your bolt out of the
body because the blade managed to shove it outside

03:04:53.183 --> 03:05:00.700
of it, and as it slowly gurgles to the ground and
collapses, the Hex is gone, the Slow is gone, and

03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:03.179
the ogre is gone.

03:05:03.179 --> 03:05:08.745
TRAVIS: That regains nine hit points for me
because of Hexblade's Curse. Thank you!

03:05:08.745 --> 03:05:10.991
TALIESIN: Oh, that's cool.

03:05:10.991 --> 03:05:14.376
SAM: Matt's falling apart.

03:05:14.376 --> 03:05:15.233
LAURA: Oh no!

03:05:15.233 --> 03:05:16.621
MATT: I know. I hit my sleeve. It's all good. I
got it!

03:05:16.621 --> 03:05:18.118
SAM: How will the writers communicate with him?

03:05:18.118 --> 03:05:19.273
MARISHA: Your identity!

03:05:19.273 --> 03:05:21.223
LAURA: It happens. Oh, it's magnets?

03:05:21.223 --> 03:05:22.408
MATT: Yeah, magnets.

03:05:22.408 --> 03:05:24.636
SAM: Without those, we'll see his feminine wrists.

03:05:24.636 --> 03:05:26.498
(laughter)

03:05:26.498 --> 03:05:32.526
MATT: What's wrong with that? You have another
attack, if you want to move and attack something else.

03:05:32.526 --> 03:05:37.961
ASHLEY: Okay, so I will move. Can I make it to
this?

03:05:37.961 --> 03:05:42.753
MATT: Oh, easily. You saunter up aside from Beau.
Beau, as you're pummeling, you look over your

03:05:42.753 --> 03:05:46.558
shoulder and have Yasha arrive, eyes black, giant
skeletal wings.

03:05:46.558 --> 03:05:51.900
MARISHA: Dude, you look <i>dope</i>. I just want to
say.

03:05:51.900 --> 03:05:54.491
TRAVIS: She just snaps to you.

03:05:54.491 --> 03:05:57.061
MARISHA: You're fucking hot! Let's go!

03:05:57.061 --> 03:05:58.758
MATT: Fear effect only happens when you initiate
it. It's not--

03:05:58.758 --> 03:06:03.443
ASHLEY: Okay, great. Okay, I will attack him now.

03:06:03.443 --> 03:06:08.807
TALIESIN: Welcome to the world of tanking.

03:06:08.807 --> 03:06:13.482
ASHLEY: One less d6 because it's not the first
attack, right? So 2d6.

03:06:13.482 --> 03:06:20.319
MATT: Correct, 2d6. Plus five. You do get to deal
extra necrotic damage to it, equal to your level.

03:06:20.319 --> 03:06:21.684
Because of your transformation.

03:06:21.684 --> 03:06:22.871
ASHLEY: Because of the transformation.

03:06:22.871 --> 03:06:24.415
MATT: An additional five damage to this.

03:06:24.415 --> 03:06:29.138
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, on top of the extra five? It's
plus ten? Okay.

03:06:29.138 --> 03:06:30.364
SAM: Jesus.

03:06:30.364 --> 03:06:33.383
ASHLEY: 21.

03:06:33.383 --> 03:06:36.174
MARISHA: She's going to fucking kill this
motherfucker.

03:06:36.174 --> 03:06:37.519
MATT: 21 points of damage.

03:06:37.519 --> 03:06:41.110
SAM: 21 points against who?

03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:42.662
MARISHA and TALIESIN: The other ogre.

03:06:42.662 --> 03:06:44.024
SAM: Oh, shit!

03:06:44.024 --> 03:06:45.983
TRAVIS: Yasha came to game, dawg!

03:06:45.983 --> 03:06:47.315
ASHLEY: (growls)

03:06:47.315 --> 03:06:49.201
MATT: That finishes your turn.

03:06:49.201 --> 03:06:51.896
MARISHA: I thought she was going to take him out,
too.

03:06:51.896 --> 03:06:57.502
MATT: They've been beaten around quite heavily at
this point, and it looks like some of them may

03:06:57.502 --> 03:07:03.491
have been previously wounded from something else.
You have carved a giant chunk out of its torso.

03:07:03.491 --> 03:07:10.542
That finishes your turn. The wolves go. One of
them is still asleep. The other one that's

03:07:10.542 --> 03:07:17.572
currently being harried by three of you is going
to attempt to strike-- ah, damn it. There we go.

03:07:17.572 --> 03:07:24.320
Lollipop. It's going to attempt to strike at you.
Nope, that's a 14.

03:07:24.320 --> 03:07:25.728
LAURA: Ha!

03:07:25.728 --> 03:07:33.042
MATT: At this point, that finishes the wolf's
turn. The other one is sleeping, unconscious. Top

03:07:33.042 --> 03:07:34.451
of the round, Beau, you're up.

03:07:34.451 --> 03:07:41.664
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going towards this fucking
ogre. I'm going to do a pole vault situation. Lift

03:07:41.664 --> 03:07:55.905
myself up, and then come down with a big ol' slap.
First strike. Okay! 20 total for the first one.

03:07:55.905 --> 03:08:00.957
Okay, that's not good, five damage.

03:08:00.957 --> 03:08:02.487
MATT: Five damage.

03:08:02.487 --> 03:08:08.615
MARISHA: Second one, I'm on his shoulders and I'm
coming down, that's another 20 total.

03:08:08.615 --> 03:08:10.461
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

03:08:10.461 --> 03:08:15.288
MARISHA: Fucking-- okay, nine damage.

03:08:15.288 --> 03:08:23.620
MATT: (whacking) (snarl) You actually jam it in
part of the giant wound. Part of its muscle is

03:08:23.620 --> 03:08:25.876
flopping over from where Yasha had struck him.

03:08:25.876 --> 03:08:29.176
LAURA: Hit under his arm! Hit his ribs like you
did with me! Hit his ribs!

03:08:29.176 --> 03:08:35.393
MARISHA: Hit his ribs? Okay! Hearing Jester, I'm
going to do Flurry of Blows, which I wasn't going

03:08:35.393 --> 03:08:42.146
to do, but hearing Jester, I'm going to because I
felt so fucking inspired. I'm going to, leaning

03:08:42.146 --> 03:08:46.587
off of the ogre, do like a (pop pop pop pop) into
his ribs.

03:08:46.587 --> 03:08:48.006
MATT: All right. Two strikes.

03:08:48.006 --> 03:08:51.688
MARISHA: Okay.

03:08:51.688 --> 03:08:53.411
TRAVIS: You almost shattered that screen!

03:08:53.411 --> 03:09:01.047
MARISHA: Yes, I did. First one is 19, second one
is 13.

03:09:01.047 --> 03:09:02.262
MATT: Hits.

03:09:02.262 --> 03:09:20.121
MARISHA: Okay! Fucking want to (mumbling). Die!
Okay, first one is a seven, second one is a six.

03:09:20.121 --> 03:09:24.756
MATT: All right. Seven and six. Nice.

03:09:24.756 --> 03:09:26.571
MARISHA: (yelling) Ah, damn it!

03:09:26.571 --> 03:09:32.575
MATT: You're pummeling its torso, and its belly is
(jiggling).

03:09:32.575 --> 03:09:36.101
MARISHA: As I'm punching, I'm going: Die! Die!

03:09:36.101 --> 03:09:49.393
MATT: That ends Beau's go. It's now the goblins'
turn. Yeah. They're going to flee. This one's just

03:09:49.393 --> 03:09:50.346
running.

03:09:50.346 --> 03:09:51.614
SAM: Do I get a--?

03:09:51.614 --> 03:09:55.795
MATT: You don't have a melee weapon ready. Because
you have your crossbow out.

03:09:55.795 --> 03:09:57.091
SAM: Oh. Sure.

03:09:57.091 --> 03:09:58.060
TRAVIS: Is that you next to him?

03:09:58.060 --> 03:10:00.245
SAM: I mean, I can't use my crossbow as a melee--
no.

03:10:00.245 --> 03:10:01.501
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't work that way.

03:10:01.501 --> 03:10:04.044
SAM: Can I do a hand punch?

03:10:04.044 --> 03:10:05.537
MATT: Sure, I'll let you do that.

03:10:05.537 --> 03:10:07.742
LAURA: Hey!

03:10:07.742 --> 03:10:09.967
SAM: 20.

03:10:09.967 --> 03:10:11.940
MATT: Strength bonus, not dexterity.

03:10:11.940 --> 03:10:13.341
SAM: 20.

03:10:13.341 --> 03:10:15.029
MATT: Okay, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:10:15.029 --> 03:10:16.173
SAM: Strength bonus.

03:10:16.173 --> 03:10:17.024
LAURA: Yeah, 17.

03:10:17.024 --> 03:10:17.819
SAM: Oh, 17.

03:10:17.819 --> 03:10:19.137
MATT: One damage plus your strength modifier.

03:10:19.137 --> 03:10:22.175
SAM: My unarmed strike says plus three to hit for
some reason. I have no idea why.

03:10:22.175 --> 03:10:24.096
MATT: What's your strength modifier?

03:10:24.096 --> 03:10:25.451
SAM: Zero.

03:10:25.451 --> 03:10:32.247
MATT: You do one point of damage to it as you
slug it in the back of the head, it runs off the

03:10:32.247 --> 03:10:38.750
board in this direction. This one is going to run
this way.

03:10:38.750 --> 03:10:39.842
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a--

03:10:39.842 --> 03:10:41.545
MATT: Yes, you do. Go for it.

03:10:41.545 --> 03:10:44.948
TALIESIN: That's 19.

03:10:44.948 --> 03:10:46.346
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:10:46.346 --> 03:10:49.464
TALIESIN: That's five points of damage.

03:10:49.464 --> 03:10:56.211
MATT: Five points of damage. You strike past it.
It keeps running, charges this direction. The ogre

03:10:56.211 --> 03:11:01.658
right now, being surrounded and watching the rest
of its fellows run away, is backing up and

03:11:01.658 --> 03:11:10.325
looking, "Where Emmett?!" Oh yeah, thank you. He's
blocked from my position. He is going to, seeing

03:11:10.325 --> 03:11:17.925
everything else fleeing, scatter as well. Just
runs off the map. That finishes their go. Caleb,

03:11:17.925 --> 03:11:19.238
you're up.

03:11:19.238 --> 03:11:23.189
LIAM: Yeah, okay, I'm going to start muttering
under my breath and stretch out two hands and send

03:11:23.189 --> 03:11:29.006
two Magic Missiles: one at the one that ran that
way, and two at this one, and two at the one that

03:11:29.006 --> 03:11:30.476
ran that way.

03:11:30.476 --> 03:11:31.952
MATT: Okay. You're casting it at level two?

03:11:31.952 --> 03:11:35.947
LIAM: I'm casting it at level two.

03:11:35.947 --> 03:11:39.885
MATT: Yeah, so it's two missiles each. Go ahead
and roll damage. 1d4 plus one per missile.

03:11:39.885 --> 03:11:48.157
LIAM: Okay, so the one that was near Nott is three
and seven for that one.

03:11:48.157 --> 03:11:50.540
MATT: He gets hit by both, continues to run. He's
wounded, but still alive.

03:11:50.540 --> 03:11:55.508
LIAM: <i>Verdammt.</i> Two, three and seven for that
one as well.

03:11:55.508 --> 03:12:00.368
MATT: Seven for this one? The one that's running
past Molly, both missiles hit it from two

03:12:00.368 --> 03:12:05.175
different sides, and his head pops open from both
sides of the force damage hitting it. Its body

03:12:05.175 --> 03:12:09.299
runs for like three more steps before it (boom)
onto the ground on its own.

03:12:09.299 --> 03:12:14.134
LIAM: I will just stay put.

03:12:14.134 --> 03:12:17.877
MATT: Okay, finishing Caleb's go. Fjord, you're
up. Molly, you're on deck.

03:12:17.877 --> 03:12:22.962
TRAVIS: Amazing. I'm going to use my bonus action
to cast Hex on that tall--

03:12:22.962 --> 03:12:25.383
LAURA: (Texan accent) Drink of water?

03:12:25.383 --> 03:12:28.298
TRAVIS: Yeah. On that waterfall of ugliness.

03:12:28.298 --> 03:12:31.811
MATT: Okay. You have your sword in your hand, and
the shield.

03:12:31.811 --> 03:12:33.309
TRAVIS: Oh. I'll drop the sword.

03:12:33.309 --> 03:12:37.015
MATT: Okay, so you drop the sword. Cast Hex to
strike this fellow.

03:12:37.015 --> 03:12:42.665
TRAVIS: I will send two bursts of Eldritch Blast
in its direction.

03:12:42.665 --> 03:12:44.109
MATT: Go for it.

03:12:44.109 --> 03:12:45.777
TRAVIS: That's a 13.

03:12:45.777 --> 03:12:46.926
MATT: That hits.

03:12:46.926 --> 03:12:49.653
TRAVIS: And a 16.

03:12:49.653 --> 03:12:51.194
MATT: Hits. Roll damage for each.

03:12:51.194 --> 03:12:53.184
SAM: He's going down.

03:12:53.184 --> 03:13:07.309
TRAVIS: That's eight and six and 1d6. 12.

03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:08.682
MATT: Do that twice because you hit it twice.

03:13:08.682 --> 03:13:11.161
TRAVIS: Oh. 13.

03:13:11.161 --> 03:13:12.570
MATT: 13 points of damage?

03:13:12.570 --> 03:13:13.606
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:13:13.606 --> 03:13:14.570
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:13:14.570 --> 03:13:15.742
(cheering)

03:13:15.742 --> 03:13:21.844
TRAVIS: I'll see them whaling on that big fucker
and I release the falchion and send two across the

03:13:21.844 --> 03:13:23.124
way at him.

03:13:23.124 --> 03:13:28.224
MATT: Okay. Beau's been pummeling it, Yasha carved
into it, it's looking like it's ready to flee. As

03:13:28.224 --> 03:13:33.666
it turns around this way, it sees this flash of
greenish light out of the corner of its eye, looks

03:13:33.666 --> 03:13:42.451
back. They both impact right in the chest, outside
of its shoulder blades in the back, two blasts of

03:13:42.451 --> 03:13:46.708
crimson, leaving these two smoking holes in its
chest that you can partially see through, and it

03:13:46.708 --> 03:13:56.225
falls back, knocking this tree over in the
process. The rest, the surviving goblins have

03:13:56.225 --> 03:14:01.462
seemingly scattered, leaving you in the
battlefield with one wolf that is unconscious.

03:14:01.462 --> 03:14:06.344
(laughter)

03:14:06.344 --> 03:14:07.593
SAM: Take it as a pet!

03:14:07.593 --> 03:14:10.227
MATT: That finishes Fjord's go.

03:14:10.227 --> 03:14:11.521
TRAVIS: Indeed.

03:14:11.521 --> 03:14:12.608
MATT: Molly, you're up.

03:14:12.608 --> 03:14:16.555
TALIESIN: I'm going to run towards the horses,
where they came off to the left, and as I pass

03:14:16.555 --> 03:14:21.469
that wolf, I'm going to take a couple swipes at
it.

03:14:21.469 --> 03:14:23.168
MATT: Go for it.

03:14:23.168 --> 03:14:27.309
TALIESIN: That's an 18 and a 17 roll.

03:14:27.309 --> 03:14:29.035
MATT: Yeah, roll some damage.

03:14:29.035 --> 03:14:34.846
TALIESIN: Let's just see what that does, before I
see if I even take a third shot. That's (counting)

03:14:34.846 --> 03:14:37.099
18 points of damage.

03:14:37.099 --> 03:14:39.816
MATT: The wolf is misted.

03:14:39.816 --> 03:14:44.698
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep heading towards the
cart to see if that goblin is still there.

03:14:44.698 --> 03:14:46.196
LAURA: Yeah, Molly!

03:14:46.196 --> 03:14:51.559
MATT: You get right up next to Beau and that's the
extent of it there. That ends your turn, Molly?

03:14:51.559 --> 03:14:53.557
Ogres are done. Nott, you're up.

03:14:53.557 --> 03:14:58.669
SAM: Oh. I'm going to turn and chase the goblin
that ran away from me.

03:14:58.669 --> 03:15:02.635
MATT: You start giving chase?

03:15:02.635 --> 03:15:03.830
SAM: Mm-hmm.

03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:08.546
MATT: You run; you see him. You get up to this
point and you can see where he is.

03:15:08.546 --> 03:15:09.904
SAM: How far away is he?

03:15:09.904 --> 03:15:15.148
LIAM: It would've been about 60 feet away from you
if he used his action to dash.

03:15:15.413 --> 03:15:19.691
MATT: He's 60 feet away from you. He's right where
he is, essentially, and you got that far. He's 30

03:15:19.691 --> 03:15:20.820
feet from you.

03:15:20.820 --> 03:15:22.366
SAM: Okay. Well, with 30 feet, I will take a
shot.

03:15:22.366 --> 03:15:23.221
MATT: Go for it.

03:15:23.221 --> 03:15:24.524
SAM: Okay.

03:15:24.524 --> 03:15:26.070
SAM: That's a 20-something

03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:27.466
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:15:27.466 --> 03:15:28.917
SAM: Okay. Just one, right?

03:15:28.917 --> 03:15:29.971
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:15:29.971 --> 03:15:33.018
SAM: Seven points of damage.

03:15:33.018 --> 03:15:37.752
MATT: Seven points of damage to him. All right, he
has seven from him.

03:15:37.752 --> 03:15:38.998
SAM: He had seven from the magic missile.

03:15:38.998 --> 03:15:40.051
MATT: Yeah, magic missile. Yeah, that's enough.

03:15:40.051 --> 03:15:41.330
SAM: Plus a one point punch.

03:15:41.330 --> 03:15:52.279
MATT: You release the crossbow. It falls to the
ground, breathing hard and tries to stand up,

03:15:52.279 --> 03:15:55.653
falls down to its knee again, and then collapses
on the ground, no longer moving.

03:15:55.653 --> 03:16:01.207
SAM: Cool. I can't see the other one that went
towards the horses, right?

03:16:01.207 --> 03:16:02.471
MATT: Nope, not at the moment.

03:16:02.471 --> 03:16:11.224
SAM: All right, I'm going to use my bonus action
to dash closer to the body to see if I can

03:16:11.224 --> 03:16:12.660
recognize this goblin.

03:16:12.660 --> 03:16:17.522
MATT: Okay. You move up to it. We'll get to that
next round. For the narrative purposes of this,

03:16:17.522 --> 03:16:21.167
nothing is currently engaging you in combat. The
wolf that is on death's door is currently

03:16:21.167 --> 03:16:24.652
unconscious and bleeding out from the spell that
you gave it.

03:16:24.652 --> 03:16:29.074
LIAM: I would have said if we'd gotten around to it
that if I could go another 30 feet in this

03:16:29.092 --> 03:16:34.172
direction, if I could still see the last goblin
that went this way, I would fire off more magic

03:16:34.172 --> 03:16:36.707
missiles to finish it. But that's only if I can
see it.

03:16:36.707 --> 03:16:40.466
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage,
because it is dark and at night.

03:16:40.466 --> 03:16:43.698
LIAM: Terrible. Six.

03:16:43.698 --> 03:16:49.931
MATT: Nah, he's gone. It darted off. One survivor
made it.

03:16:49.931 --> 03:16:54.049
For the purposes of ease here, you've
managed to finish off the wolf that's currently

03:16:54.049 --> 03:16:58.112
unconscious really quickly. Molly, you're
standing next to it and it's on the ground.

03:16:58.128 --> 03:17:02.204
TALIESIN: Well, yeah, and I'm heading my way
because I saw that one run off to the--

03:17:02.204 --> 03:17:05.445
MATT: You had the bonus action, because you didn't
use it. You're going to run up and put it out of

03:17:05.445 --> 03:17:15.833
its misery. You guys gather at this point, and
with your wounds, the poison still (throbbing) in

03:17:15.833 --> 03:17:22.705
your veins for both you and Caleb. Around the
corner, you see there's the horse cart, about 30

03:17:22.705 --> 03:17:27.409
to 40 feet from where you are, and there's one
goblin grabbing a bunch of sacks. He's like,

03:17:27.409 --> 03:17:33.497
(excited panting). He turns around and sees all of
you standing there in the clearing, and goes--

03:17:33.497 --> 03:17:34.928
TRAVIS: Drop it.

03:17:34.928 --> 03:17:39.377
MATT: He goes into a full sprint in the opposite
direction.

03:17:39.377 --> 03:17:40.753
LIAM: Magic Missile.

03:17:40.753 --> 03:17:42.432
MATT: Roll damage. Level one?

03:17:42.432 --> 03:17:44.270
LIAM: No. Let's do level three.

03:17:44.270 --> 03:17:46.785
TALIESIN: With a Vicious Mockery, too.

03:17:46.785 --> 03:17:54.858
MATT: That is a 12, so I think it succeeds. It's
unfortunate.

03:17:54.858 --> 03:17:57.489
TALIESIN: Might as well.

03:17:57.489 --> 03:18:01.767
LIAM: That's 20.

03:18:01.767 --> 03:18:13.507
MATT: 20. You watch him run. These what would be
five missiles, anime Gundam-style. The goblin

03:18:13.507 --> 03:18:23.017
(panting) (poofing) It's harried repeatedly with
these missiles impacting him. It's pretty rough.

03:18:23.017 --> 03:18:32.087
With that, silence falls upon the field. Your cart
regained and the goblin running off spooks the

03:18:32.087 --> 03:18:35.901
horses a bit and they pull the cart another ten
feet or so, but they eventually slow down.

03:18:35.901 --> 03:18:37.704
TALIESIN: Go scrape that up off the ground.

03:18:37.704 --> 03:18:39.576
LIAM: Yeah. Who wants to go with me to go get our
stuff?

03:18:39.576 --> 03:18:41.798
TALIESIN: I was already on my way there.

03:18:41.798 --> 03:18:44.016
TRAVIS: Yasha?

03:18:44.016 --> 03:18:47.242
ASHLEY: Is it gone?

03:18:47.242 --> 03:18:53.961
MATT: At this point, the wings fold and vanish.
Her eyes come back to normal color. The white tips

03:18:53.961 --> 03:18:55.501
of her hair return.

03:18:55.501 --> 03:18:58.171
TRAVIS: You feeling okay?

03:18:58.171 --> 03:19:06.519
ASHLEY: I feel fine. Molly has seen this before.
If you sometimes startle me out of my sleep, it

03:19:06.519 --> 03:19:12.199
happens. Sorry. I got startled and I got mad
immediately because I saw him.

03:19:12.199 --> 03:19:16.611
TRAVIS: You had--

03:19:16.611 --> 03:19:18.756
LAURA: Are you an angel?

03:19:18.756 --> 03:19:20.806
ASHLEY: I don't--

03:19:20.806 --> 03:19:21.999
TRAVIS: You had wings.

03:19:21.999 --> 03:19:25.885
ASHLEY: Yeah. I guess. It just happens. I don't
know.

03:19:25.885 --> 03:19:27.819
SAM: Some people have sleep apnea.

03:19:27.819 --> 03:19:30.909
MARISHA: Yeah. Is that a Xhorhasian thing?

03:19:30.909 --> 03:19:39.821
ASHLEY: Not that I know of. I was the only one who
had this thing. I don't know.

03:19:39.821 --> 03:19:43.399
LAURA: At home, you mean? You were the only one of
your family that had it?

03:19:43.399 --> 03:19:46.399
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:19:46.490 --> 03:19:49.871
TRAVIS: Can you fly?

03:19:49.871 --> 03:19:51.148
LAURA: (gasp)

03:19:51.148 --> 03:19:52.375
ASHLEY: No.

03:19:52.375 --> 03:19:53.701
LAURA: Have you tried?

03:19:53.701 --> 03:19:54.968
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:19:54.968 --> 03:19:56.375
LAURA: Okay.

03:19:56.375 --> 03:19:58.449
TRAVIS: Only when you're really angry?

03:19:58.449 --> 03:20:08.259
ASHLEY: Yeah, sometimes I get really angry, you
know? Don't you wake up and get off on the wrong

03:20:08.259 --> 03:20:15.031
side of the cot, and someone startles you awake? I
don't know.

03:20:15.031 --> 03:20:21.576
LIAM: Caleb, in Celestial, says: No, but really,
are you an angel?

03:20:21.576 --> 03:20:23.857
ASHLEY: I reply back in Celestial.

03:20:23.857 --> 03:20:25.529
SAM: Oh shit!

03:20:25.529 --> 03:20:30.031
ASHLEY: I say: Well, of sorts, I guess.

03:20:30.031 --> 03:20:32.701
LAURA: What did you say?

03:20:32.701 --> 03:20:35.087
MARISHA: They're speaking a language.

03:20:35.087 --> 03:20:37.695
ASHLEY: I didn't know you spoke this language.

03:20:37.695 --> 03:20:41.575
LIAM: It's a secret nerdy language you wouldn't
understand.

03:20:41.575 --> 03:20:43.860
MARISHA: Oh god, what are they talking about?

03:20:43.860 --> 03:20:45.374
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's really--

03:20:45.374 --> 03:20:46.717
MARISHA: Oh, such FOMO.

03:20:46.717 --> 03:20:50.091
(laughter)

03:20:50.091 --> 03:20:56.741
LIAM: Continuing in Celestial.

03:20:56.741 --> 03:20:59.905
LAURA: Do you want us to leave the table?

03:20:59.905 --> 03:21:12.564
LIAM: Just Laura! Well, I figure you're going to
have to explain this a bit, either now or later.

03:21:12.564 --> 03:21:14.713
Do you want to do it now or later?

03:21:14.713 --> 03:21:21.366
MARISHA: I think he's hitting on her. I can't
tell, but--

03:21:21.366 --> 03:21:29.870
ASHLEY: I mean, I will tell you, but-- I will tell
everyone, it's fine, but should we clean up or, I

03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:31.126
don't know, something?

03:21:31.126 --> 03:21:33.276
TRAVIS: She's gesturing an awful lot, I don't
know.

03:21:33.276 --> 03:21:35.175
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe she's angry.

03:21:35.175 --> 03:21:37.343
LAURA: Her face looks angry.

03:21:37.343 --> 03:21:40.495
LIAM: There's nothing around, right? Perception
check?

03:21:40.495 --> 03:21:41.928
TRAVIS: Just us!

03:21:41.928 --> 03:21:44.784
LAURA: Just all of us staring at you.

03:21:44.784 --> 03:21:46.316
LIAM: Just a ten. Besides you.

03:21:46.316 --> 03:21:48.711
MATT: You don't see anything. You seem to be
relatively alone.

03:21:48.711 --> 03:21:53.165
LAURA: I pull down my Spiritual Weapon and start
licking it.

03:21:53.165 --> 03:21:55.269
TALIESIN: It tastes like wolf and ogre.

03:21:55.269 --> 03:21:57.884
LAURA: Only the parts that hit the wolf and the
ogre.

03:21:57.884 --> 03:21:59.028
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:21:59.028 --> 03:22:02.786
LIAM: In Celestial: The blue one is getting pouty,
we better switch back to Common.

03:22:02.786 --> 03:22:06.021
MARISHA: He seems passive, I don't know.

03:22:06.021 --> 03:22:15.693
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's do it because I've-- We'll
talk about it, I promise, I just, let's just--

03:22:15.693 --> 03:22:20.698
we'll talk about it, I promise. Okay? Hello.

03:22:20.698 --> 03:22:25.886
SAM and LAURA: Hello!

03:22:25.886 --> 03:22:31.261
ASHLEY: It's nice to talk with someone who has,
you know, language from--

03:22:31.261 --> 03:22:33.593
LAURA: Xhorhas?

03:22:33.593 --> 03:22:35.579
TRAVIS: What language is that?

03:22:35.579 --> 03:22:38.755
ASHLEY: I don't--

03:22:38.755 --> 03:22:40.468
LAURA: Xhorhasian, I think?

03:22:40.468 --> 03:22:47.575
MATT: It's less a Xhorhasian language, and more
one that you're not quite certain why you

03:22:47.575 --> 03:22:49.425
understand it.

03:22:49.425 --> 03:22:53.196
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's Xhorhasian, so it's amazing
that you know.

03:22:53.196 --> 03:22:56.365
TRAVIS: Caleb, you're very--

03:22:56.365 --> 03:22:57.969
LIAM: Well-read.

03:22:57.969 --> 03:23:00.566
LAURA: He's a spy.

03:23:00.566 --> 03:23:03.977
TALIESIN: At this point, am I back with all of the
gold and all of the sacks?

03:23:03.977 --> 03:23:05.365
TRAVIS: Oh, from--

03:23:05.365 --> 03:23:08.687
SAM: Did I look at the goblins?

03:23:08.687 --> 03:23:11.009
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:23:11.009 --> 03:23:19.461
SAM: Over 20. 23.

03:23:19.461 --> 03:23:21.323
MATT: You don't recognize them.

03:23:21.323 --> 03:23:24.723
SAM: Do I find anything interesting on the body?

03:23:24.723 --> 03:23:33.683
MATT: Short bows, scimitars, grungy, some of them
coated with excrement and other things to make

03:23:33.683 --> 03:23:36.224
them nasty when they carve through and infect
wounds.

03:23:36.224 --> 03:23:40.188
TRAVIS: What about the big old weapons that the
two bruisers were-- are they massive?

03:23:40.188 --> 03:23:42.082
MATT: Large greatclubs that are carved.

03:23:42.082 --> 03:23:43.524
ASHLEY: Did he say excrement?

03:23:43.524 --> 03:23:45.208
MATT: On some of the scimitars. They look nasty.

03:23:45.208 --> 03:23:46.955
LAURA: Are they wearing underwear?

03:23:46.955 --> 03:23:48.217
MATT: No.

03:23:48.217 --> 03:23:50.048
LAURA: (horrified yelling)

03:23:50.048 --> 03:23:58.748
MATT: But there are a few pouches that haven't
been spilled or utilized entirely of toxin.

03:23:58.748 --> 03:24:02.022
SAM: Of toxin? Can I grab those?

03:24:02.022 --> 03:24:08.566
MATT: With that investigation check, you manage to
pull five vials of toxin, unused. Each one has a

03:24:08.566 --> 03:24:11.514
single use on some sort of a weapon.

03:24:11.514 --> 03:24:14.756
TRAVIS: Five vials of toxin.

03:24:14.756 --> 03:24:16.374
SAM: I've got them.

03:24:16.374 --> 03:24:19.563
LAURA: I'm going to draw that in my journal.

03:24:19.563 --> 03:24:27.621
SAM: All right, I'm going to rejoin the group.

03:24:27.621 --> 03:24:38.858
TRAVIS: Well, not that that wasn't terribly
exciting. Still crazy dark out?

03:24:39.049 --> 03:24:42.137
MATT: Yeah, it's middle of the night, maybe one or
two in the morning.

03:24:42.137 --> 03:24:48.373
TRAVIS: Thanks for catching that, you two. If that
had snuck up on us, we would have been super

03:24:48.373 --> 03:24:49.334
fucked.

03:24:49.334 --> 03:24:53.049
LAURA: Oh my gods, can you imagine what would have
happened if they were all over us when we woke up?

03:24:53.049 --> 03:24:58.115
TRAVIS: Yeah, we would have been paste. Caleb,
Nott, thank you.

03:24:58.115 --> 03:25:01.927
MARISHA: Nott, did you recognize any of those
goblins?

03:25:01.927 --> 03:25:14.278
SAM: I did not. No, this is not my clan at all.
Which is not surprising, since we operated not in

03:25:14.278 --> 03:25:15.731
this area.

03:25:15.731 --> 03:25:17.491
LAURA: Did you hang out with ogres, too?

03:25:17.491 --> 03:25:29.728
SAM: No, we did not. I've heard of goblins hanging
out with ogres before, and I don't think they're

03:25:29.728 --> 03:25:32.789
too dissimilar. But we didn't.

03:25:32.789 --> 03:25:35.490
LAURA: Nott, are you okay?

03:25:35.490 --> 03:25:37.286
SAM: I think so.

03:25:37.286 --> 03:25:40.433
LAURA: Was it weird to fight other goblins?

03:25:40.433 --> 03:25:47.849
SAM: It was very rewarding.

03:25:47.849 --> 03:25:52.485
LAURA: Oh. You liked it?

03:25:52.485 --> 03:25:58.634
SAM: Yes. I'm only sad that one got away.

03:25:58.634 --> 03:26:06.614
MARISHA: Nott, do you share the same hatred in
yourself?

03:26:06.736 --> 03:26:09.688
SAM: What do you mean?

03:26:09.688 --> 03:26:14.153
MARISHA: You seem to hate your kind quite a lot. I
don't know.

03:26:14.153 --> 03:26:32.374
SAM: Do I hate myself? No, I'm cool. I mean, she
had wings, so you want to talk about that

03:26:32.374 --> 03:26:34.010
instead?

03:26:34.010 --> 03:26:35.566
MARISHA: Yeah, we can. Yeah, hey.

03:26:35.566 --> 03:26:40.808
TRAVIS: You seem real excited to hurt your own
kind.

03:26:40.808 --> 03:26:53.859
SAM: Well, I know that I'm a goblin. For as long
as I've been alive, I haven't felt comfortable in

03:26:53.859 --> 03:27:18.097
my skin for as long as I can remember. I just feel
like I shouldn't be-- I don't fit in with them.

03:27:18.189 --> 03:27:30.730
It's not just that. This feels wrong, like I
should be in a different body. The way they act,

03:27:30.730 --> 03:27:46.300
and the way they are. It's just not me. They do
horrible things to people, and they seem fine with

03:27:46.300 --> 03:28:00.957
it, but I don't know. I never felt the same as
them. It's not that I don't like myself or

03:28:00.957 --> 03:28:14.458
anything; I think I'm okay. But I just don't like
how I feel when I see my hands or my feet. They

03:28:14.458 --> 03:28:19.679
just feel wrong. I want to be different.

03:28:19.679 --> 03:28:23.285
LIAM: Was there anyone you were close to?

03:28:23.285 --> 03:28:39.651
SAM: Not in my clan, no. But there was someone. I
think I was telling you before that they give you

03:28:39.651 --> 03:28:52.037
a job as soon as you're able to do one. They tried
me on so many different jobs. But I was not a

03:28:52.037 --> 03:29:02.641
soldier, I was not a good cook, I wasn't good at
sewing or building. So they stuck me with the

03:29:02.641 --> 03:29:04.386
torturer.

03:29:04.386 --> 03:29:05.743
LAURA: What?!

03:29:05.743 --> 03:29:09.315
SAM: I wasn't the torturer. I was the torturer's
assistant.

03:29:09.315 --> 03:29:11.430
LAURA: Oh, you were <i>Nott</i> a torturer.

03:29:11.430 --> 03:29:27.839
SAM: No. I saw a lot of things, and there was a
halfling village not far away. They captured

03:29:27.839 --> 03:29:40.543
someone from the village and they wanted me to
kill him. But instead, I was kind to him, and he

03:29:40.543 --> 03:29:55.910
started talking. My fellow gobbies didn't like
that, but they allowed it because I was getting

03:29:55.910 --> 03:30:04.191
valuable information about where the halflings
kept their food, and where they went to harvest,

03:30:04.191 --> 03:30:12.230
and where we could attack them. But I became
friends with him. He was nice.

03:30:12.230 --> 03:30:14.002
LAURA: What happened to him?

03:30:14.002 --> 03:30:19.868
SAM: Well, I hope he got away.

03:30:19.868 --> 03:30:22.917
LAURA: Did you leave before he did?

03:30:22.917 --> 03:30:25.980
SAM: We left together.

03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:27.871
LAURA: (whispers) Really?!

03:30:27.871 --> 03:30:31.239
MARISHA: What was his name?

03:30:31.239 --> 03:30:39.525
SAM: It's not important. He was just a nice man.

03:30:39.525 --> 03:30:46.109
LAURA: Did you love him?

03:30:46.109 --> 03:30:59.211
SAM: I don't know. He was a chemist, so he taught
me about alchemy, and liquids, and potions and

03:30:59.211 --> 03:31:10.203
things. And he taught me his language. When he had
taught me everything he could, they said to kill

03:31:10.203 --> 03:31:23.975
him. But I didn't want to, so I got <i>real</i> drunk,
and I created a distraction, and I hope he got

03:31:23.975 --> 03:31:25.314
away.

03:31:25.314 --> 03:31:27.408
LAURA: What was the distraction?

03:31:27.408 --> 03:31:34.776
SAM: I shot one of my fellow goblins in the butt.

03:31:34.776 --> 03:31:37.713
LAURA: That's good.

03:31:37.713 --> 03:31:45.974
SAM: He yelled a lot. Then we ran off in separate
directions, and I've been running ever since.

03:31:45.974 --> 03:31:47.540
LAURA: Wow.

03:31:47.540 --> 03:31:50.225
MARISHA: Where would he go?

03:31:50.225 --> 03:31:52.458
SAM: I assume back to his village.

03:31:52.458 --> 03:31:56.495
LAURA: But your goblin friends knew where the
village was.

03:31:56.495 --> 03:32:07.517
SAM: Yes, I know, but I don't know, I can't go to
that village. I'll be stoned to death.

03:32:07.517 --> 03:32:09.184
LAURA: Why? But you helped him!

03:32:09.184 --> 03:32:10.355
SAM: I'm a goblin.

03:32:10.355 --> 03:32:12.356
LIAM: What if we went with you?

03:32:12.356 --> 03:32:16.385
SAM: You could maybe go.

03:32:16.385 --> 03:32:24.535
LAURA: What if we cast Disguise Person on you, and
you could find out if he was okay?

03:32:24.535 --> 03:32:30.620
SAM: I mean, we're going the opposite direction.

03:32:30.620 --> 03:32:36.933
LAURA: What if after we do this, we go down there
and see?

03:32:36.933 --> 03:32:42.300
SAM: I don't know if we should go back. There's
too many bad people around there. What if I run

03:32:42.300 --> 03:32:49.492
into the tribe? What if someone from the village
sees me? They hate goblins.

03:32:49.492 --> 03:32:51.743
LIAM: Did you see what Yasha just did though?

03:32:51.743 --> 03:32:54.619
SAM: Yeah, that was freaky deaky.

03:32:54.619 --> 03:33:00.637
LAURA: We just killed two ogres and some wolves,
and a bunch of other goblins. We could probably do

03:33:00.637 --> 03:33:04.575
some serious damage to your old, mean tribe.

03:33:04.575 --> 03:33:07.404
MARISHA: Nott, there are bad people everywhere.

03:33:07.404 --> 03:33:09.218
SAM: I know.

03:33:09.218 --> 03:33:13.400
MARISHA: Doesn't mean you have to associate
yourself with them.

03:33:13.400 --> 03:33:18.586
LAURA: Just because you look like them, doesn't
mean that you have to be like them.

03:33:18.586 --> 03:33:21.682
MARISHA: Yeah, you're one of us now. And aren't we
great?

03:33:21.682 --> 03:33:23.715
SAM: Yes?

03:33:23.715 --> 03:33:25.362
LAURA: There's that creepy smile again, Beau.

03:33:25.362 --> 03:33:29.291
MARISHA: I'm trying real hard to not make it super
scary.

03:33:29.291 --> 03:33:34.621
LIAM: I think it is a good idea to go there, when
we are finished.

03:33:34.621 --> 03:33:43.292
SAM: I'm okay for now, just getting away from them
has been wonderful. And I've met you, Caleb, and

03:33:43.292 --> 03:33:51.146
you don't seem to care how I look or who I was.

03:33:51.146 --> 03:33:58.361
LIAM: I do not care. I know who you are now. If
you don't want to go back there, we don't have to

03:33:58.361 --> 03:34:03.625
go back there. But if you actually do, don't be
afraid to ask. I will go with you.

03:34:03.625 --> 03:34:05.869
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we all will.

03:34:05.869 --> 03:34:11.609
MARISHA: I think we're all a little bit of an
island of misfits.

03:34:11.609 --> 03:34:15.967
TRAVIS: Knowing all that, you showed a lot of
bravery tonight.

03:34:15.967 --> 03:34:18.160
MARISHA: Nott the Brave.

03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:20.014
SAM: Well.

03:34:20.014 --> 03:34:22.102
LAURA: Maybe there is a comma.

03:34:22.102 --> 03:34:28.671
TRAVIS and MARISHA: You earned your comma.

03:34:28.671 --> 03:34:33.434
SAM: Let's just call it a hyphen for now.

03:34:33.434 --> 03:34:36.242
TRAVIS: Gradual steps.

03:34:36.264 --> 03:34:39.629
SAM: And maybe we'll move to an ellipsis or
something.

03:34:39.629 --> 03:34:42.286
TRAVIS: Working our way through syntax.

03:34:42.286 --> 03:34:45.519
ASHLEY: Nott, I'm very sorry we made fun of you
eating children.

03:34:45.519 --> 03:34:56.504
SAM: That's okay. I haven't eaten any children! I
have no desire to eat children! But I've seen

03:34:56.504 --> 03:35:04.646
children being eaten, and goblins are awful.
They're terrible in every way. If you're not good,

03:35:04.646 --> 03:35:07.822
they cut you, or kill you or throw you away.

03:35:07.822 --> 03:35:10.555
ASHLEY: Wait, so you ran away?

03:35:10.555 --> 03:35:13.497
SAM: As fast as I could.

03:35:13.497 --> 03:35:21.831
MARISHA: What got you locked up with this guy?

03:35:21.831 --> 03:35:30.761
SAM: Being me. I think I was probably stealing
some food or something.

03:35:30.761 --> 03:35:33.227
LIAM: You told me it was cherry wine.

03:35:33.227 --> 03:35:35.038
SAM: All right, it was booze.

03:35:35.038 --> 03:35:39.043
MARISHA: Cherry wine's real good though.

03:35:39.043 --> 03:35:49.332
SAM: But you know they're not wrong, right? The
people who arrested me are not incorrect. If you

03:35:49.332 --> 03:35:51.157
see a goblin, you should kill it on sight.

03:35:51.157 --> 03:35:52.316
TRAVIS: Well, no.

03:35:52.316 --> 03:35:53.536
LAURA: Maybe not, though.

03:35:53.536 --> 03:35:54.466
SAM: Yes.

03:35:54.466 --> 03:35:56.063
LAURA: Maybe some of them are nice like you.

03:35:56.063 --> 03:35:57.764
SAM: Absolutely not. None of them are.

03:35:57.764 --> 03:35:59.251
ASHLEY: You can't be the only one.

03:35:59.251 --> 03:36:03.819
SAM: I have never met another nice one. Ever. And
I really tried!

03:36:03.819 --> 03:36:07.189
LAURA: In your tribe. Have you gone to other
tribes?

03:36:07.189 --> 03:36:08.440
SAM: No.

03:36:08.440 --> 03:36:11.451
LAURA: Maybe you were just in a really shitty
tribe.

03:36:11.451 --> 03:36:14.573
SAM: It feels like I was in a very average tribe.

03:36:14.573 --> 03:36:26.223
TRAVIS: There could be enlightened tribes out
there, committed to changing their ways.

03:36:26.223 --> 03:36:38.636
SAM: That would be fine for them, but like I said,
this is not me. I don't want to be this.

03:36:38.636 --> 03:36:40.938
TRAVIS: That's fine. You're with us.

03:36:40.938 --> 03:36:43.517
SAM: I'm never going to be cool with this. Ever.

03:36:43.517 --> 03:36:51.154
MARISHA: I've counted. You've said "not"like five
times, in a circumstance that's not your name.

03:36:51.274 --> 03:37:01.661
It's super inspiring in a weird way. It's all like
super relevant. Just throwing it out there.

03:37:01.661 --> 03:37:06.606
MATT: There's a crack of thunder. The rain begins
to come down as one of the slowly encroaching

03:37:06.606 --> 03:37:09.385
storms begins to pour down in the middle of the
night.

03:37:09.385 --> 03:37:16.497
TALIESIN: Well, I'm sleeping underneath the cart.
I'm picking up all the stuff. This has been very

03:37:16.497 --> 03:37:21.721
enlightening. There is probably going to be
lightning. Anyone else who wants to join me?

03:37:21.721 --> 03:37:24.061
LAURA: I don't know if we will all fit.

03:37:24.061 --> 03:37:25.386
TALIESIN: We'll snuggle.

03:37:25.386 --> 03:37:26.744
TRAVIS: I'm all right in the rain.

03:37:26.744 --> 03:37:27.737
ASHLEY: Same.

03:37:27.737 --> 03:37:28.717
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:37:28.717 --> 03:37:30.160
LAURA: I'm okay in the rain.

03:37:30.160 --> 03:37:31.599
SAM: Too much water.

03:37:31.599 --> 03:37:32.748
LAURA: I am!

03:37:32.748 --> 03:37:37.626
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a little camp
underneath the cart.

03:37:37.626 --> 03:37:40.269
MARISHA: I don't know if I can sleep.

03:37:40.269 --> 03:37:47.961
LAURA: I need to sleep. I got injured.

03:37:47.961 --> 03:37:49.741
MARISHA: I'll take the next watch.

03:37:49.741 --> 03:37:55.752
ASHLEY: I can take the first watch. I'd like to
stay outside for a little bit.

03:37:55.752 --> 03:37:57.488
TRAVIS: I'll take the first-- oh wait.

03:37:57.488 --> 03:38:00.855
ASHLEY: Who had-- did you-- were you doing it?

03:38:00.855 --> 03:38:02.994
MARISHA: Boulders, parchment, shears for first
watch.

03:38:02.994 --> 03:38:05.025
TRAVIS: No, y'all got it. I'm just up anyway.

03:38:05.025 --> 03:38:07.556
LAURA: I'm going to sleep.

03:38:07.638 --> 03:38:09.261
TALIESIN: Join me under the cart?

03:38:09.261 --> 03:38:10.418
LAURA: Oh, all right.

03:38:10.418 --> 03:38:11.603
SAM: Are we on? What's going on?

03:38:11.603 --> 03:38:15.129
LIAM: We're arguing about who's going to take
the first watch.

03:38:15.270 --> 03:38:16.936
TRAVIS: You can sleep in the rain or under the
cart.

03:38:16.936 --> 03:38:19.121
LIAM: We could finish the watch that we didn't
really finish.

03:38:19.121 --> 03:38:20.839
SAM: Sure, let's do that.

03:38:20.839 --> 03:38:22.493
LIAM: Why don't you take the next one?

03:38:22.493 --> 03:38:31.846
MATT: Taking the final watch? Roll perception for
me if you don't mind.

03:38:31.846 --> 03:38:34.047
TALIESIN: A band of--

03:38:34.047 --> 03:38:36.649
MATT: Disadvantage for the darkness.

03:38:36.649 --> 03:38:38.822
LIAM: Can I say something short to Nott before we
switch to the last?

03:38:38.822 --> 03:38:40.078
MATT: Sure.

03:38:40.078 --> 03:38:50.184
LIAM: Sitting in the rain. You know, I never
talked about my past for obvious reasons, and I

03:38:50.184 --> 03:38:59.155
didn't want questions pointed back at me. Still no
pressure on you, but if you ever want to talk more

03:38:59.155 --> 03:39:10.834
about it, the door is always open for you, Nott.
When you are ready.

03:39:10.834 --> 03:39:13.994
SAM: Thank you, Caleb.

03:39:13.994 --> 03:39:22.621
I tasted a baby once, just once. I didn't 
know, they were handing around a

03:39:22.621 --> 03:39:34.279
bowl. I didn't know what was in it, and then later
somebody said there was like-- I mean, they put a

03:39:34.279 --> 03:39:40.066
bunch of different meat in there. How was I
supposed to know that it was like a goulashy thing?

03:39:40.066 --> 03:39:45.006
LIAM: Who am I to judge?

03:39:45.006 --> 03:39:48.662
SAM: Good night.

03:39:48.662 --> 03:39:52.667
LIAM: I fall asleep in the mud and rain.

03:39:52.667 --> 03:39:55.842
MATT: What did you roll?

03:39:55.842 --> 03:39:57.250
ASHLEY: I didn't roll yet.

03:39:57.250 --> 03:40:00.598
LIAM: More ogres and goblins.

03:40:00.598 --> 03:40:09.023
ASHLEY: 13.

03:40:09.023 --> 03:40:17.194
MATT: As you complete the final watch, the rain
doesn't subside. The flashes of lightning and the

03:40:17.194 --> 03:40:22.714
rolling of thunder makes it a bit difficult, but
the exhaustion of the previous battle manages to

03:40:22.714 --> 03:40:26.582
combat that enough for those of you who want to
complete your evening's rest, you do. Until

03:40:26.582 --> 03:40:31.798
eventually the glow of the morning's light brings
you all to consciousness once more. The rain

03:40:31.798 --> 03:40:39.245
reduces itself to a drizzle. You gather your
materials, do the best you can to warm up, shaking

03:40:39.245 --> 03:40:51.201
yourself in the cold, damp morning. Gather your
cart, slowly head back towards the roadway, and

03:40:51.201 --> 03:40:55.627
continue your journey towards the Labenda Swamp.
And that's where we will end tonight's episode.

03:40:55.627 --> 03:40:58.133
LIAM: Five more hours.

03:40:58.133 --> 03:41:02.539
MARISHA: Just live here.

03:41:02.539 --> 03:41:08.003
MATT: If I didn't have anything to do tomorrow. If
I wasn't flying to Canada tomorrow, I could keep

03:41:08.003 --> 03:41:09.071
going.

03:41:09.071 --> 03:41:10.047
SAM: Oh no, you have a thing?

03:41:10.047 --> 03:41:11.014
MATT: Yeah.

03:41:11.014 --> 03:41:13.084
SAM: Did I miss that in the announcements?

03:41:13.084 --> 03:41:13.979
MATT: I think you did.

03:41:13.979 --> 03:41:15.097
TRAVIS: You just don't pay attention.

03:41:15.097 --> 03:41:20.609
MATT: He was too busy with his own. Anyway, thank
you guys. We'll pick this up next week on Thursday

03:41:20.609 --> 03:41:26.824
from there, as we have about a day's worth of
travel before you get there. With enough speed,

03:41:26.824 --> 03:41:28.668
you will get there before the next dusk.

03:41:28.668 --> 03:41:30.320
SAM: Six more battles before we get there.

03:41:30.320 --> 03:41:40.615
MATT: Oh yeah, totally. Until then, you guys have
yourself a wonderful week, we love you very much,

03:41:40.615 --> 03:41:44.557
and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

03:41:44.557 --> 03:54:42.962

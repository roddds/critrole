00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.532
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:06.175
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:07.692
TRAVIS: Yeah we do!

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:11.766
MATT: If you recognize from those voices, we have
returning finally, after the first foray into

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.918
parenthood, Travis and Laura! Welcome back!

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:19.980
TRAVIS: You guys are a sight for sore eyes! Hi,
Matt.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.802
MATT: We have missed you so much.

00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:23.546
LIAM: I am so happy!

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.188
MATT: How's the kid?

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:26.244
LAURA: No, he's great.

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:32.141
TRAVIS: Yeah, no. He's just a love and (snoring).

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:36.083
LAURA: He's here in the studio right now, so you
might hear crying. If I get up from the table,

00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:37.537
it's because I'm going to go feed him.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.813
MATT: Aw. That's true.

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:41.166
TRAVIS: He dictates all.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.001
LAURA: We are at his whim.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:43.923
MATT: Welcome back.

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:45.114
TRAVIS and LAURA: Thank you!

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:47.066
MATT: We're happy to have you. We missed you at
the live show.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.169
TRAVIS: I know.

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:50.444
LAURA: We were with you there in spirit.

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.514
MATT: I know, we felt it.

00:00:51.514 --> 00:00:54.756
TRAVIS: Loved the birthday song, it was such great
energy. You guys did so good.

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:56.382
MATT: The audience was fantastic.

00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:59.262
LAURA: You guys looked wonderful. You especially,
Samuel.

00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:00.408
SAM: Thank you.

00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:05.728
MATT: Let's go ahead and get into our
announcements so we can kick into the game today.

00:01:05.728 --> 00:01:10.552
Tonight, we have two fantastic sponsors. Our
first, our wonderful returning sponsor for

00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:14.089
campaign two, our friends and D&amp;amp;D Beyond. Sam.

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:19.719
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond! Thanks to D&amp;amp;D Beyond for
sponsoring and helping out with the live show.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.712
Your sponsorship dollars will help our cast pay
for the therapy they need after seeing my junk so

00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:33.198
close and personal. It's been a while since Travis
and Laura were here, and this is their first show

00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:39.930
at the new studio. So D&amp;amp;D Beyond wanted me to
bring them up to speed, to catch them up with

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.853
things, with all things CR. Here is your update,
you might want to take notes: Laura, the new wifi

00:01:47.853 --> 00:01:54.791
password is "DallasSux" with an "x." Travis, we
rented out your parking spot to Brian Foster. The

00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:57.585
cardboard box he lives in will be parked there
until September 15th.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:02.741
LAURA: I thought he was in the cage!

00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:06.890
SAM: The Wayfarer's Guide to Eberron, The
Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica are both available

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.331
on D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:10.337
TRAVIS: Oh good! I'm writing this down.

00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:14.582
SAM: Travis, while you were gone, we discovered
Fjord's middle name is Bronco, so that's canon

00:02:14.582 --> 00:02:18.978
now. Laura, while you were gone, your dice were
all loaned to Wil Wheaton for a little while.

00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:19.809
LAURA: Oh no.

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:28.324
SAM: The break room is open to all, but from 9:00
to 11:00 in the morning, Max uses it to poop. We

00:02:28.324 --> 00:02:32.989
have a code system for reserving the makeup room,
so no one walks in. If you're breastfeeding, hang

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.794
a sock on the door. If you're waxing Sam Riegel's
chest hair, you hang a bandana on the door, and if

00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:47.900
you're having sex, leave the door open because
that's kinky. Travis, we reinforced your chair to

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.767
accommodate your baby weight.

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:54.860
TRAVIS: It's real! Guys can get it, too!

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.143
SAM: Laura, you are a perfect creature who creates
magical life with the power of womanhood.

00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:06.057
Taliesin's new character is a cleric, so you don't
have to heal anyone.

00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:06.739
LAURA: Fuck yes!

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.608
SAM: Liam shaved. It's Ashley's birthday. Marisha
no longer thinks sleeves are bullshit, now she

00:03:13.608 --> 00:03:21.451
thinks they're assholes. All firblogs--bolgs know
each other. If you go number one, please use the

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:30.654
bathroom marked "Peeastock." If you go number two,
use the one marked "Hupperdook." And there are

00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:34.368
flies motherfucking everywhere in the studio. And
that's it.

00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:37.866
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:41.075
SAM: To D&amp;amp;D Beyond, for sponsoring that inane
list.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:43.292
MATT: We appreciate that.

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:46.960
LIAM: I had a fur blog in the early 2000s.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.565
TALIESIN: Updated it every day, didn't you?

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:58.873
MATT: Our second sponsor tonight, our fantastic
friends at Dwarven Forge. You may have seen some

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:05.715
of their products used pretty consistently on this
show since I've had access to them. I've hungered

00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:15.144
after their work since I was a mid-20s-er,
whatever you'd call that. Yeah. Thanks to their

00:04:15.144 --> 00:04:18.874
Kickstarters and their update from dwarvenite to
resin, I was able to find them more affordable,

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:24.100
and I love using it. They're big time Critters as
well. They've been invested in the show, and

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.061
they're also general leaders in hand sculpted and
painted terrain sets. I love them, and they

00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:34.736
launched another Kickstarter recently for their
Caverns Deep! set, which is awesome. It offers 15

00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:41.188
different distinct encounter areas, like, as it
says here, the Webbed Lair, the Mushroom Grotto,

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:45.491
and a brand new forest terrain system called the
Dreadhollow Forest, which me and Liam got unveil

00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.926
at Gen Con in a live game, that looks so fucking
cool!

00:04:48.926 --> 00:04:52.686
LIAM: I know! I backed that shit!

00:04:52.686 --> 00:04:59.887
MATT: So did I. We're there, you should back it
too! They also put out a video, I think yesterday,

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.312
the day before, that unveils one of their
passages, I think it's the prison passage, where

00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:10.312
you get to watch me, as a little mini, get
imprisoned, brutalized, and then murdered! It's fun!

00:05:10.312 --> 00:05:15.657
LIAM: I didn't realize when we were trying to save
your voice box in the game at Gen Con, that that

00:05:15.657 --> 00:05:16.884
was part of a running inside joke.

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:23.768
MATT: They asked if I'd help out with that, and
I'm like, fuck yeah. You can become a backer now,

00:05:23.768 --> 00:05:28.049
if you're interested, at critrole.com/dwarvenforge
for all the information about the current

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:34.438
Kickstarter. It ends August 14th, so it's ending
really soon. If you want to get in there, with all

00:05:34.438 --> 00:05:39.904
the amazing stretch goals, go check it out, and be
the first to check out the exclusive Kickstarter

00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:47.598
at the price point that only the Kickstarter
enables. Honey Heist 2: Electric Beargaloo--

00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:48.839
MARISHA: Oh my god!

00:05:48.839 --> 00:06:01.445
MATT: --will air tomorrow at 7:00pm Pacific Time
here at twitch.tv/criticalrole. Critical Role.

00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:05.237
Also, if you haven't seen yet, my fireside chat
that we had on Tuesday, it's available on

00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:12.497
YouTube.com/criticalrole, where I drink a lot of
really nice ports and talk questions and fun

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:17.249
stuff. So it was a good hangout time. Hope to do
those more in the future as well. I actually

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.190
really enjoyed just sitting there and getting
mildly tipsy with the Internet. It's fun. What the

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.178
hell was that?

00:06:23.178 --> 00:06:24.732
SAM: It was the magnets.

00:06:24.732 --> 00:06:25.425
MATT: Oh god.

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:30.121
TRAVIS: Quit putting your sex toys on the desk,
man. Keep them underneath.

00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:32.607
LAURA: Did my hit points already get updated on my
thingie?

00:06:32.607 --> 00:06:33.285
MATT: Yeah.

00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:35.703
TRAVIS: That's the DM at work.

00:06:35.703 --> 00:06:38.560
MATT: That's what happens when people aren't
updating it fast enough and we need to update the

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.049
sheets here, so I do it for you.

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:41.066
LAURA: Sorry, Matthew.

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:42.179
SAM: Just blame the baby.

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.664
LAURA: I do.

00:06:42.664 --> 00:06:43.430
MATT: That's okay.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.796
LIAM: Can we get a show of hands for everyone who
got max HP this level-up?

00:06:47.796 --> 00:06:49.252
MATT: Yeah, it's fucking bullshit.

00:06:49.252 --> 00:06:51.165
LIAM: Fuck you, and you, and fuck you, and
especially fuck you.

00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:52.389
LAURA: I got three last time, though.

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.152
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got new baby magic, man. I'll
take it where I can get it.

00:06:55.152 --> 00:07:00.525
MATT: She did roll pretty poorly last time. Ashley
got an 11. Yeah.

00:07:00.525 --> 00:07:01.457
MARISHA: Yasha!

00:07:01.457 --> 00:07:07.952
MATT: Yeah, so whenever we get her back, she's
going to be a little beefier. Last but not least,

00:07:07.952 --> 00:07:11.713
we have a bunch of new items in the shop. We have
our retro tees back, we have the new Critter cap

00:07:11.713 --> 00:07:12.484
is in stock.

00:07:12.484 --> 00:07:14.478
LAURA: Hey, wait! That's my job!

00:07:14.478 --> 00:07:16.215
MATT: I thought you said you didn't have anything
to update.

00:07:16.215 --> 00:07:18.446
LAURA: No, I said I didn't have anything to hold
up!

00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:19.626
MATT: Then here, go for it!

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:21.724
LAURA: We have new shirts! We have new hats!

00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:25.095
MARISHA: She's been gone so long, don't take her
job!

00:07:25.095 --> 00:07:29.447
LAURA: I don't know which camera to look at
because it's a little different than before.

00:07:29.447 --> 00:07:30.833
SAM: That one right there.

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:31.536
LAURA: This one?

00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:32.044
SAM: Yeah.

00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:34.999
LAURA: There's a bumper sticker that says, "The
Traveler is My Co-Pilot."

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:37.930
TRAVIS: Beautiful. Keep going, yeah. Do it for
your son.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.845
LAURA: There's-- we have The Mighty Nein shirt. I
don't know what else is there anymore.

00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:43.904
LIAM: Jeez, get off my back, Mom!

00:07:43.904 --> 00:07:45.378
MARISHA: The shirt, yeah, good.

00:07:45.378 --> 00:07:46.374
SAM: The bumper sticker.

00:07:46.374 --> 00:07:50.363
LAURA: We have the bumper sticker, we have the
hats, we have the t-shirts, and we have a pin,

00:07:50.363 --> 00:07:54.398
which is going to come back in the store. It's not
in the store just at this moment, but it will be back.

00:07:54.398 --> 00:07:55.466
MATT: It will be back, yeah.

00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:58.171
LAURA: And there's other things coming in the
store soon, too.

00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:00.040
TRAVIS: Nice job, babe. A-one. Top shelf.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.171
MATT: As a reminder, we have our Wyrmwood
giveaways at the break. We'll have information on

00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:09.397
that when we get to it, but you'll have to move
over to the twitch.tv/criticalrole chat to jump

00:08:09.397 --> 00:08:15.243
into it and be a part of it. But we'll talk of
that when we get to it. With that, our

00:08:15.243 --> 00:08:16.749
announcements for the evening are done.

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:17.629
TRAVIS: I have a question.

00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:18.303
MATT: Yes?

00:08:18.303 --> 00:08:22.996
TRAVIS: Where do I add the +2 to strength for the
dad strength I have now?

00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:25.790
(laughter)

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.312
TRAVIS: Okay, that's it. I'm already a dad. That's
all I had to say!

00:08:29.312 --> 00:08:34.915
MATT: Your timing is impeccable. With that, let's
go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of

00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:37.495
Critical Role.

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:41.762
[click, TV static]

00:08:41.762 --> 00:09:59.325
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:09:59.325 --> 00:10:12.845
MATT: And welcome back, everybody. That was a
unique rush. Last we left off-- we're going to do

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:17.554
a little bit of time bending here, so we can make
sure we get everything we want to. Last we left

00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:24.280
off, The Mighty Nein, upon heading towards the
second leg of their journey, completing a task for

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:30.828
The Gentleman, of who they had left Zadash to earn
money and praise with, found themselves in the

00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:34.825
outskirts of Hupperdook, where three members of
their team were captured in the middle of the

00:10:34.825 --> 00:10:36.565
night by a group of traveling slavers.

00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:38.297
LAURA: Which members?

00:10:38.297 --> 00:10:40.266
TRAVIS: Pay attention!

00:10:40.266 --> 00:10:43.297
MARISHA: Oh no, Jester has amnesia, you guys.

00:10:43.297 --> 00:10:46.753
MATT: Oh, the amnesia arc. You've got to have one
at every point in the party. We lost one, we gain

00:10:46.753 --> 00:10:56.236
one. I know. These three members-- Yasha, Jester,
and Fjord-- all captured by the Iron Shepherds,

00:10:56.236 --> 00:11:02.838
this group of slavers, and dragged north to
Shadycreek Run, outside of the laws of the Empire.

00:11:02.838 --> 00:11:10.930
The rest of the members, finding new allies in
Keg, the dwarven fighter; Nila, the firbolg druid;

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:19.942
and a brief reappearance of the fantastic human
cleric, Shakäste. These friends together managed

00:11:19.942 --> 00:11:26.298
to storm the gifted stronghold of The Sour Nest,
attack and destroy, one by one, this team of

00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:31.025
slavers, leaving The Iron Shepherds down to their
last few in the subterranean basement where these

00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:37.879
cages contained their friends, chained and held in
darkness. There, the battle with Lorenzo,

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:42.636
revealing his final form after stalking them
invisibly from the air for their entire journey

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:51.053
through that fortress, revealed himself to be an
oni, a terrible creature of nightmare and entirely

00:11:51.053 --> 00:11:55.804
unnatural strength and capability. However,
through some ingenuity, fast thinking, and some

00:11:55.804 --> 00:12:05.409
incredible luck, Lorenzo found himself unable to
escape. The members of your team, knocked

00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:12.588
unconscious, brought back from the brink, and a
final blow was dealt by Caleb, as his arcane

00:12:12.588 --> 00:12:22.135
cinders burned away the final remnants of
Lorenzo's demonic form. There, as you began to

00:12:22.135 --> 00:12:28.941
inspect the interior of the subterranean chamber,
you discovered in one set of these prison cells to

00:12:28.941 --> 00:12:38.284
the left, there lie chained Jester and Fjord. In
the other, an unconscious Yasha. With that, you

00:12:38.284 --> 00:12:44.750
made your way through the bars, unlocking the
mechanisms that held them at bay, and have now

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:52.541
come back face to face with your taken friends,
with one new friend, and one missing. And that's

00:12:52.541 --> 00:13:04.869
where we come in. Jester, you and Fjord both, in
the chamber after enduring the sounds of other

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:14.958
captors being punished, being tortured, and a
nearby friend enduring it silently just to

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:20.689
frustrate them. You've been trying desperately to
contemplate ways of escape, to try and find a way

00:13:20.689 --> 00:13:28.504
to relieve yourself of your bindings to no avail.
Then suddenly, there's the sound of battle,

00:13:28.504 --> 00:13:35.735
weapons scraping on stone and metal and flesh,
screams, familiar voices, flashes of light, the

00:13:35.735 --> 00:13:42.452
air rushing warm and cold with the nearby blasting
of arcane energies, divine forces and powers

00:13:42.452 --> 00:13:49.545
brought in to sustain and snuff life, and then
silence. You hear the voices come close, and as

00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:56.641
you barely manage to move over and glance over
your shoulder, you watch as the bars swing open to

00:13:56.641 --> 00:14:02.358
the chamber where you're held, and the tiny form
of Nott the Brave rushes over and embraces you, saying:

00:14:02.358 --> 00:14:04.120
SAM: Case closed.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.442
LAURA: (muffled speech)

00:14:08.442 --> 00:14:15.221
SAM: Oh, yes, okay! I'll take whatever is on her
mouth off.

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.004
MATT: You pull off what is essentially a thick
leather gag that has been keeping her from

00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:19.545
speaking.

00:14:19.545 --> 00:14:23.402
LAURA: (gasps) Oh!

00:14:23.402 --> 00:14:25.452
SAM: Hello.

00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:28.487
LAURA: How did you guys find us?

00:14:28.487 --> 00:14:37.914
SAM: Well, we followed the clues, we traced the
evidence, we thought about it logically, and also

00:14:37.914 --> 00:14:41.231
this girl who was walking down the street told us
where to go.

00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:41.827
LAURA: Really?

00:14:41.827 --> 00:14:42.331
SAM: Yeah!

00:14:42.331 --> 00:14:48.015
LAURA: I didn't even get to tell anyone! I tried
to. I tried to cast Sending, but my hands are bound.

00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:50.813
SAM: Oh, let me untie you. I'll cut out-- cut off
her hands.

00:14:50.813 --> 00:14:55.821
MATT: They're bound by chained manacles, but we'll
say, given the fact that there is no immediate

00:14:55.821 --> 00:14:59.935
pressure of time, you take your time with the
bindings, using your lock picks, and manage to

00:14:59.935 --> 00:15:01.070
free her of the manacles.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.433
LAURA: Thank you. Fjord is also tied up, though,
really bad.

00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:08.733
SAM: How are you doing? Oh, sorry.

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:15.729
LAURA: Oh, my muscles would be really sore. This
is really hard for me. Somebody else should help

00:15:15.729 --> 00:15:16.480
him out.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.946
SAM: Are you sure he's not just--?

00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:21.197
LAURA: Seriously, though, this is really painful,
somebody should help him.

00:15:21.197 --> 00:15:22.758
SAM: Okay, we'll help him out.

00:15:22.758 --> 00:15:26.879
LAURA: Do you know how bad it is to have your
hands tied behind your back for several days?

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:27.791
SAM: I don't, no.

00:15:27.791 --> 00:15:28.706
LAURA: It's not fun.

00:15:28.706 --> 00:15:34.251
SAM: Oh no! Fjord, are you all right? Are you
injured? Did they cut off your thumbs?

00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:41.020
TRAVIS: No, we got our thumbs. Where is-- Where is
Yasha?

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.231
SAM: Oh, I don't know. Do you guys see Yasha?

00:15:44.231 --> 00:15:46.245
TRAVIS: They took her out of here. They were--

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:48.413
LAURA: They knocked her unconscious.

00:15:48.413 --> 00:15:51.978
SAM: Hey! Beau, do you see Yasha out there?

00:15:51.978 --> 00:15:53.846
MARISHA: I look in the other chamber. Is she in
there?

00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:57.007
MATT: As you guys had noticed, at this point
you've glanced over in the other chamber and you

00:15:57.007 --> 00:16:04.187
do see, faced away and lying within the other
chamber, is Yasha. You manage to eventually get it

00:16:04.187 --> 00:16:08.375
open, and inside, she is lying there, motionless.

00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:11.315
MARISHA: Can I check her to see if she's still
breathing?

00:16:11.785 --> 00:16:19.306
MATT: Mm-hmm. It's really relatively easy to
check: she's breathing. She looks pretty

00:16:19.306 --> 00:16:25.316
brutalized. There are gashes and tear marks in the
flesh where hooks were pulled through, there are

00:16:25.316 --> 00:16:32.867
streaks of dried blood on her. But she's not
unconscious within an inch of her life. She's a

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:42.274
hardy woman, and she's endured a lot and then
some, and she lies here unconscious before you,

00:16:42.274 --> 00:16:44.288
still bound in manacles.

00:16:44.288 --> 00:16:50.124
LIAM: Seeing Beau go in ahead of me, still sitting
on the table, I mutter a word and cast Knock and

00:16:50.124 --> 00:16:51.610
the manacles fall away.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.023
MARISHA: Deuces.

00:16:54.023 --> 00:16:54.939
TALIESIN: Hmm?

00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:56.668
MARISHA: Have any healing left?

00:16:56.668 --> 00:16:58.063
TALIESIN: Not a drop.

00:16:58.063 --> 00:17:04.798
LAURA: You have-- I have healing, though. Don't
worry, I have healing. Who are you? I have healing.

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:06.302
MARISHA: Are you okay?

00:17:06.302 --> 00:17:11.490
LAURA: Yes. I mean, I can heal. I haven't been
using any spells-- I can't use anything when your

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.321
hands are tied.

00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:14.976
MARISHA: I just give Jester a big hug.

00:17:14.976 --> 00:17:21.434
LAURA: Thank you, Beau. Thank you guys.

00:17:21.434 --> 00:17:24.518
SAM: Well, let's-- let's move.

00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:26.697
LAURA: I go cast Cure Wounds on Yasha.

00:17:26.697 --> 00:17:40.987
MATT: The wounds seal up and she notably becomes
healthier. Some scars still remain, but she's

00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:44.106
further from the brink. But still unconscious.

00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:49.231
TRAVIS: Is the room clear? Did you take care of
all of them?

00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:54.310
SAM: Yes. Yes, I think so. We haven't scouted
around every--

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.275
TRAVIS: There were so many.

00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:57.251
SAM: We had some help.

00:17:57.251 --> 00:17:58.632
TRAVIS: You did?

00:17:58.632 --> 00:18:00.292
SAM: Shakäste's here.

00:18:00.292 --> 00:18:01.410
LAURA: I saw Shakäste!

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:01.990
TRAVIS: Shakäste?

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.829
LAURA: No, we saw him in one of the-- I just
couldn't tell you! I saw him in one of the other cages.

00:18:06.858 --> 00:18:08.759
TRAVIS: I didn't see him.

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:16.363
MARISHA: There was also a really nice firbolg
named Nila. Her son and her mate got scooped up.

00:18:16.363 --> 00:18:18.782
LAURA: Is that like Pumat Sol?

00:18:18.782 --> 00:18:22.548
MARISHA: Yeah. It's like him, too.

00:18:24.058 --> 00:18:24.885
TALIESIN: Hi.

00:18:24.885 --> 00:18:27.948
MARISHA: This is Caduceus, he also came with us to
help out.

00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:28.972
LAURA: Caduceus.

00:18:28.972 --> 00:18:29.797
TALIESIN: Hello.

00:18:29.797 --> 00:18:30.443
LAURA: Hi.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:31.842
SAM: We met him this morning.

00:18:31.842 --> 00:18:36.254
MARISHA: We've had an interesting 24 hours.

00:18:36.254 --> 00:18:40.200
TALIESIN: I'm here to help. I made a deal with
this one. It's okay.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.621
LAURA: I like your hair.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.484
TALIESIN: Thank you. I like your hair, too.

00:18:43.484 --> 00:18:44.153
LAURA: Thank you.

00:18:44.153 --> 00:18:47.388
TRAVIS: Caduceus, I'm Fjord. Appreciate your
help.

00:18:47.388 --> 00:18:49.722
TALIESIN: You want to get up out of this thing?

00:18:49.722 --> 00:18:50.341
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:51.975
LAURA: Where's Molly?

00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:53.408
TALIESIN: Who?

00:18:53.408 --> 00:18:54.951
TRAVIS. Molly.

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:57.778
TALIESIN: Oh, your friend.

00:19:00.078 --> 00:19:00.938
LIAM: Jester.

00:19:00.938 --> 00:19:03.706
LAURA: Is he waiting upstairs?

00:19:05.996 --> 00:19:07.301
MARISHA: He didn't make it.

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:15.166
LAURA: To this dungeon? Because he's waiting
upstairs?

00:19:18.576 --> 00:19:24.008
MARISHA: He didn't survive the trip. I'm really
sorry.

00:19:24.008 --> 00:19:26.320
LAURA: Was that when we heard you guys?

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.069
TRAVIS: The caravan.

00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:30.884
LAURA: We were in the caravan, we heard you guys
fighting.

00:19:32.074 --> 00:19:32.833
MARISHA: Fuck!

00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:35.957
LAURA: We heard people shouting, I heard you call
for Molly.

00:19:37.037 --> 00:19:37.945
SAM: Yeah.

00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:43.506
TRAVIS: We couldn't see you. We could barely see
anything. We were stuck, they had us gagged and

00:19:43.506 --> 00:19:50.706
bound. I swore I heard a few voices, but we were
moving before we knew it.

00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:54.045
LAURA: We tried shouting. There's just no way you
could hear us.

00:19:54.045 --> 00:20:02.761
LIAM: No, we are sorry. We tried our best, but it
wasn't good enough.

00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:11.195
SAM: He tried his best. He got right up in
Lorenzo's face, and he just wasn't strong enough.

00:20:11.195 --> 00:20:21.500
MARISHA: We got cocky and underestimated our
enemies.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.484
TRAVIS: It's not your fault.

00:20:23.484 --> 00:20:24.978
LAURA: Where did you leave him?

00:20:24.978 --> 00:20:31.187
MARISHA: He's buried in the wood. The Bramblewood.
Right? No, that's not right. That's the old campaign.

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:35.052
MATT: You buried him along the Glory Run Road.

00:20:35.052 --> 00:20:44.681
MARISHA: That's a fitting name. We can take you
there.

00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:47.064
LAURA: Okay.

00:20:47.064 --> 00:20:51.071
MARISHA: It's on the way back to Zadash. We've got
to talk to the Gentleman, anyway.

00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:57.001
LAURA: Did you kill everyone here?

00:20:57.001 --> 00:20:59.155
SAM: I think so.

00:20:59.155 --> 00:21:00.692
LAURA: Lorenzo?

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:02.209
SAM: Yep.

00:21:02.209 --> 00:21:04.859
LAURA: What about that short guy that was really
mean?

00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:05.633
SAM: Protto?

00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:07.320
MARISHA: Fuck him. Protto.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.253
LIAM: We should be sure.

00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:14.812
TRAVIS: They were a nasty bunch. Lorenzo was not
what he seemed.

00:21:14.812 --> 00:21:15.629
MARISHA: No.

00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:24.468
LIAM: We need to give the house the once-over.
Make sure there is nobody left. We agreed to clear

00:21:24.468 --> 00:21:25.883
this house of everything.

00:21:25.883 --> 00:21:44.557
TRAVIS: Fuck! I'm sorry. We should have seen them
coming, heard them. We just weren't expecting it.

00:21:48.027 --> 00:21:49.589
MARISHA: It's no one's fault.

00:21:51.829 --> 00:21:53.154
TRAVIS: It doesn't feel that way.

00:21:53.154 --> 00:21:55.327
MARISHA: No, it doesn't. I was lying.

00:22:00.887 --> 00:22:03.705
TRAVIS: Yasha. Yasha doesn't know.

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:14.068
LAURA: She won't know for a while. It always takes
them a while to wake up. That elven woman, she

00:22:14.068 --> 00:22:18.776
would cast something, she would do something to
the manacles.

00:22:18.776 --> 00:22:22.272
SAM: To make them impossible to--?

00:22:22.272 --> 00:22:26.596
TRAVIS: They'd beat the fucking hell out of us,
and then if there was anything left, one touch,

00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:29.305
and that was it. Darkness.

00:22:29.305 --> 00:22:38.323
MARISHA: We overheard them saying that they were
trying to break people mentally. Do you know what

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:40.030
they were trying to use you guys for?

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.967
LAURA: They were going to sell us.

00:22:41.967 --> 00:22:43.818
MARISHA: To who?

00:22:43.818 --> 00:22:45.372
LAURA: Whoever would buy us.

00:22:45.372 --> 00:22:50.053
TRAVIS: Whoever was paying. I think they were
trying to work on our minds first. Sounds like

00:22:50.053 --> 00:22:57.205
Yasha got the physical part next. It was a long
night. I preferred it to the beating, though.

00:22:59.255 --> 00:23:03.289
SAM: We saw blood when we woke up. Was that yours
or theirs?

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:06.133
TRAVIS: Probably ours.

00:23:07.763 --> 00:23:10.624
MARISHA: Fuck, you guys. I am so sorry.

00:23:12.264 --> 00:23:19.892
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say.

00:23:22.162 --> 00:23:28.390
MARISHA: Well, piece of shit is dead, all his
fucking cronies are dead.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:41.338
LIAM: And we learn for the future: this won't
happen again. You understand me?

00:23:44.108 --> 00:23:50.416
TALIESIN: I mean, this is pretty good from a
certain perspective. I mean, if you think about

00:23:50.416 --> 00:24:00.202
it. Bad things happen to people every day, and
then you have a bunch of people who care about you

00:24:00.202 --> 00:24:08.409
so much that they come and save you, fix it,
defeat a great evil. I mean, nothing this good

00:24:08.409 --> 00:24:13.551
ever happens. This is great. I'm going to go check
upstairs. I think you guys have a lot to talk

00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:17.523
about. I'm going to head upstairs and start
searching.

00:24:17.523 --> 00:24:22.345
MATT: You turn around and there's Keg awkwardly
standing in the back of the chamber, hearing all

00:24:22.345 --> 00:24:32.456
this. You can see the guilt in her eyes, and she
goes, "I'm going to go join Caduceus." Pulls out a

00:24:32.456 --> 00:24:34.683
cigarette and lights it as she follows him up.

00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:38.321
MARISHA: Caduceus is an interesting one.

00:24:38.321 --> 00:24:40.513
LAURA: I liked his hair.

00:24:40.513 --> 00:24:42.209
MARISHA: He's got great hair.

00:24:42.209 --> 00:24:43.621
LAURA: I wish I had hair like that.

00:24:43.621 --> 00:24:44.689
MARISHA: Yeah, me too.

00:24:44.689 --> 00:24:45.680
TRAVIS: Pretty positive.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.441
MARISHA: Whatever he says.

00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:55.060
LAURA: You guys did come to save us, though. Thank
you, really.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:02.057
MARISHA: Molly laid down his life for you guys. He
was the best of us.

00:25:02.057 --> 00:25:05.547
SAM: We had no choice, I mean--

00:25:05.547 --> 00:25:08.307
LAURA: You did! You did have a choice.

00:25:08.307 --> 00:25:17.601
TRAVIS: Yeah, you did. You could have let us go. I
wouldn't be telling you the truth if I didn't say

00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:20.046
I didn't consider it for a couple days.

00:25:21.516 --> 00:25:23.975
MARISHA: I would have laid down my life for you
guys.

00:25:26.545 --> 00:25:29.203
LAURA: I would have tried to heal you back.

00:25:29.203 --> 00:25:37.849
MARISHA: Thanks, Jester. Here. I pull out from the
back of my--

00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:40.779
LAURA: From your butt? What did you pull out of
your butt?

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:44.037
MARISHA: It's Molly's sword.

00:25:44.037 --> 00:25:44.859
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:45.781
SAM: Big butt.

00:25:45.781 --> 00:25:50.297
(laughter)

00:25:50.297 --> 00:25:51.488
TRAVIS: Beau got a big ol' butt.

00:25:57.078 --> 00:26:02.896
MARISHA: I think it would suit both of you, but I
feel like one of you should have it.

00:26:05.586 --> 00:26:07.560
LAURA: I mean, you roomed with him the most.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.606
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:19.678
LAURA: But I like really cool things, so, I mean,
I will take it if, you know. I was also tiefling,

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:22.718
he's a tiefling, we were both really cool.

00:26:22.718 --> 00:26:24.214
TRAVIS: What about his jacket?

00:26:24.214 --> 00:26:32.682
MARISHA: We left it to mark his grave. It's
probably stolen, but the thought was nice.

00:26:32.682 --> 00:26:35.292
TRAVIS: People need killing if that happened, so,
you know.

00:26:35.292 --> 00:26:37.263
LAURA: If I ever see anyone wearing Molly's
coat--

00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:38.920
MARISHA: We're going to fucking slit their
throats.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.146
SAM: Unless it's him. He could come back from the
dead or something. He's done it before.

00:26:43.146 --> 00:26:48.485
TRAVIS: He's done it before? Oh, right. Lucien?

00:26:48.485 --> 00:26:49.246
LAURA: Lucius.

00:26:49.246 --> 00:26:50.015
TRAVIS: Lucien.

00:26:50.015 --> 00:26:52.441
LAURA: Lucius. Lu-chel.

00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:53.746
SAM: Nonagon?

00:26:53.746 --> 00:26:56.451
LIAM: Kind of a moot point at this moment.

00:26:56.451 --> 00:27:10.594
TRAVIS: You're right. I would be honored to have
this sword. Caleb. Thank you.

00:27:13.744 --> 00:27:18.125
LIAM: Oh. Group effort.

00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:24.955
TRAVIS. Sure it was. Nott. Thanks.

00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:27.052
SAM: It's an honor.

00:27:27.052 --> 00:27:28.812
LAURA: Beau?

00:27:28.812 --> 00:27:30.054
MARISHA: Hmm?

00:27:30.054 --> 00:27:31.020
LAURA: Thank you.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.296
MARISHA: Thank you, Jester.

00:27:34.296 --> 00:27:36.317
TRAVIS: Maybe we can hold on to some of those
gags.

00:27:36.317 --> 00:27:40.279
LAURA: Me and Fjord spent a lot of time together
in this cell.

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:42.983
TRAVIS: Okay. None of that happened. No.

00:27:42.983 --> 00:27:45.876
LAURA: Lots of eye contact happening. Just between
me and you.

00:27:45.876 --> 00:27:52.020
SAM: I've heard stories about people in captivity
sort of resorting to primal instincts.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.638
LAURA: Yeah. I noticed him rolling over towards me
several times, if you know what I mean.

00:27:56.638 --> 00:27:57.861
SAM: I do know what you mean.

00:27:57.861 --> 00:28:02.603
LAURA: He kept wiggling. You can't really move
very much, you wiggle like a little--

00:28:02.603 --> 00:28:05.727
SAM: Must have been cold at night. You had to
snuggle for body heat.

00:28:05.727 --> 00:28:07.524
LAURA: Like shoulder to shoulder, like this.

00:28:07.524 --> 00:28:10.268
SAM: Ooh! That's all I need to know.

00:28:10.268 --> 00:28:16.251
(laughter)

00:28:16.251 --> 00:28:20.202
LAURA: But really, we should get Yasha out of
here, because she's still unconscious. This is

00:28:20.202 --> 00:28:24.415
fucked up. Stop joking, you guys, this is
serious.

00:28:24.415 --> 00:28:27.395
SAM: Oh, oh, oh! Kiri's fine.

00:28:27.395 --> 00:28:29.311
LAURA: Did you-- wait.

00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:32.829
SAM: Kiri's okay, Kiri's fine. We found a new
home.

00:28:32.829 --> 00:28:34.803
LAURA: I know. I was there, I said goodbye to
her.

00:28:34.803 --> 00:28:35.401
SAM: Oh, you did.

00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:38.925
(laughter)

00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:41.796
LAURA: I understand how you would think, because I
wasn't quite myself, but--

00:28:41.796 --> 00:28:46.882
SAM: Oh, also, there's this town where there's
these gnomes and they dance all night!

00:28:46.882 --> 00:28:47.763
LAURA: What?!

00:28:47.763 --> 00:28:49.719
SAM: Yeah, it's called Hupperdook. It's the
funniest name.

00:28:49.719 --> 00:28:51.034
LAURA: I love that name.

00:28:51.034 --> 00:28:56.550
SAM: Before that-- I'd forgotten how long you were
gone.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.978
LIAM: Too long.

00:28:58.978 --> 00:28:59.920
LAURA: Too long.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:07.526
TRAVIS: You've done a marvelous job, and we can't
thank you enough. Let us help you with whatever--

00:29:07.526 --> 00:29:12.068
SAM: Insight check. Has he been turned? Is he
different, is he weird?

00:29:12.068 --> 00:29:13.535
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check.

00:29:13.535 --> 00:29:18.296
(laughter)

00:29:18.296 --> 00:29:18.864
SAM: 15.

00:29:18.864 --> 00:29:22.781
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

00:29:22.781 --> 00:29:23.889
LAURA: Whispers!

00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:26.174
LIAM: Laslo has jumped bodies.

00:29:29.864 --> 00:29:31.799
SAM: Who are you, really?!

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:41.101
(laughter)

00:29:41.101 --> 00:29:42.549
MARISHA: Good times, you guys.

00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:43.626
SAM: Let's get out of here.

00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:46.032
TRAVIS: Yeah, please, get us the fuck out of
here.

00:29:46.032 --> 00:29:49.770
LAURA: Are there other prisoners in this area,
too, or is it just us?

00:29:50.112 --> 00:29:53.759
MATT: You guys were the first ones that were-- you
were the prime candidates to be broken.

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:55.522
LAURA: We were extra special.

00:29:55.522 --> 00:30:02.793
MARISHA: Hey, guys? Fuck human traffickers, am I
right?

00:30:02.793 --> 00:30:03.375
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:30:03.375 --> 00:30:04.050
LAURA: They're terrible.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.694
LIAM: Let's go rob them blind.

00:30:06.694 --> 00:30:09.002
MARISHA: Okay, let's do it.

00:30:09.002 --> 00:30:12.028
LAURA: I bet they have so much stuff!

00:30:12.028 --> 00:30:14.164
MARISHA: We rob them blind!

00:30:14.164 --> 00:30:17.880
TRAVIS: Shouldn't we try and wake up Yasha?

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.835
SAM: We have two healers here. Three.

00:30:20.835 --> 00:30:22.178
MARISHA: Well, we healed her, she's still just--

00:30:22.178 --> 00:30:24.448
TRAVIS: She's just out because of the effect of
the--

00:30:24.448 --> 00:30:30.408
LIAM: I will hang out with her while you guys go
check the house. Please bring me any books.

00:30:30.408 --> 00:30:35.681
MARISHA: We get everyone out of the basement and
we lay Yasha down upstairs some place comfortable.

00:30:36.024 --> 00:30:36.764
LIAM: I will sit with her.

00:30:36.764 --> 00:30:41.014
MATT: As you guys bring her up and you look for
other people who were in the cages, you notice

00:30:41.014 --> 00:30:47.163
that they're all missing. Shakäste has ushered
them out of the complex to get them to safety as

00:30:47.163 --> 00:30:47.961
he said he would.

00:30:47.961 --> 00:30:49.446
MARISHA: Oh Shakäste, yay.

00:30:49.446 --> 00:30:55.358
MATT: Caduceus and Keg are up there sharing a
conversation, feeling like the proverbial outsiders.

00:30:55.752 --> 00:30:59.412
TALIESIN: Yeah, I didn't actually search the
house, I just ended up in the kitchen. I'm

00:30:59.412 --> 00:31:05.883
starting to cook food. It was a nice kitchen when
we ran through it. I'm trying to see if I can put

00:31:05.883 --> 00:31:08.019
together some sort of omelette or something.

00:31:08.019 --> 00:31:10.265
MARISHA: I love that so much.

00:31:10.265 --> 00:31:14.982
MATT: I love it. Keg is going through the corpses
of the different thugs and rolling them for

00:31:14.982 --> 00:31:20.750
change. She's got a cigarette hanging out of the
mouth feeling through pockets. Who's helming the

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.695
investigation of the stronghold?

00:31:22.695 --> 00:31:23.647
MARISHA: I'll take one.

00:31:23.647 --> 00:31:25.171
SAM: I will assist.

00:31:25.171 --> 00:31:28.733
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll twice and
roll with advantage.

00:31:28.733 --> 00:31:39.269
MARISHA: What was that thing where I could spend a
ki point and do another roll on my insight check?

00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:42.883
MATT: Well no, it gives you advantage to spend a
ki point to do it.

00:31:42.883 --> 00:31:49.263
MARISHA: It gives me-- oh. Which I already have.
Okay, 16. Oh sorry. 15.

00:31:49.263 --> 00:31:58.714
MATT: 15, all right. Over the next hour or so, you
guys begin to tear through. If someone wants to

00:31:58.714 --> 00:32:00.565
take note of this, these are the things that you
find--

00:32:00.565 --> 00:32:02.124
LIAM: Short rest!

00:32:02.124 --> 00:32:04.058
LAURA: Oh, this is me writing this stuff down
now?

00:32:04.058 --> 00:32:05.374
SAM: That's your job, isn't it?

00:32:05.374 --> 00:32:08.025
LAURA: Well, somebody hijacked all my good pencils
when I was gone.

00:32:08.025 --> 00:32:09.148
SAM: Here's a pencil.

00:32:09.148 --> 00:32:20.167
MATT: All right. Amongst the bodies and materials
that have been set aside to equip those who exist

00:32:20.167 --> 00:32:30.247
within The Sour Nest, you get: six shortswords,
two longswords, two crossbows, three shortbows,

00:32:30.247 --> 00:32:38.638
and eight sets of partially damaged leather armor.
They're all used, they're not the highest quality.

00:32:38.638 --> 00:32:39.556
They're functional.

00:32:39.556 --> 00:32:41.426
MARISHA: We can sell them.

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:48.911
MATT: Possibly, depending on where you take them.
That's the low end. Because you got higher than a

00:32:48.911 --> 00:32:56.271
12, you do find-- the bottom floor is a number of
the-- the second basement floor, you find a

00:32:56.271 --> 00:33:08.089
plethora of torture implements. Plenty of brands
and small blades and hooks. You find flaying

00:33:08.089 --> 00:33:13.670
knives. It's a terrible array. If you were to
choose to take any, you could write down torture

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:25.535
implements. Should you be so inclined. You do find
on the bodies of the--

00:33:25.535 --> 00:33:27.493
MARISHA: Shooting a Hostel sequel.

00:33:27.493 --> 00:33:36.601
MATT: Yeah. On the bodies of everyone who-- all
the bodies that still remain here, as the body of

00:33:36.601 --> 00:33:43.633
Lorenzo is destroyed other than the glaive, you
find 131 gold pieces across all those bodies.

00:33:43.633 --> 00:33:46.066
LAURA: That'll make up for what you stole from
me!

00:33:46.066 --> 00:33:52.461
MATT: In the storage chests that are in various
bunkers in the top floor, you also find a potion

00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:58.506
that looks like a weird, syrupy, quicksilver type
of a liquid on the inside of this little glass

00:33:58.506 --> 00:34:05.582
vial and you find this receipt.

00:34:05.582 --> 00:34:08.113
MARISHA: (singing) Gimme gimme gimme!

00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:10.414
SAM: It'll be good for our taxes.

00:34:10.414 --> 00:34:20.121
MARISHA: Service and payments to the Iron
Shepherds. House Jagentoths. Who's Jagentoths?

00:34:20.121 --> 00:34:21.318
LIAM: We've heard that before.

00:34:21.318 --> 00:34:24.925
MATT: Yeah, Keg has spoken. That's the opposing
house to House Mardun.

00:34:24.925 --> 00:34:28.411
MARISHA: Oh, the house that sponsors The Iron
Shepherds.

00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:29.084
MATT: Yeah.

00:34:29.084 --> 00:34:32.503
MARISHA: These are the receipts (gasp)-- these are
the receipts of--!

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:33.532
SAM: Of people!

00:34:33.532 --> 00:34:35.415
MARISHA: Yeah! Oh my god!

00:34:35.415 --> 00:34:37.617
TRAVIS: Travel for hire, bribery--

00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:40.781
MARISHA: Oh, this could take down the Jagentoths.

00:34:40.781 --> 00:34:43.698
TRAVIS: Tools and materials, delivered goods
polished.

00:34:43.698 --> 00:34:50.782
MATT: Could take them down in a place that has
law. But it may have some use, you don't know.

00:34:51.254 --> 00:34:51.989
MARISHA: Blackmail!

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:59.146
MATT: You did get the baseline 15 DC, though, in
going through the upstairs chamber that you found

00:34:59.146 --> 00:35:09.810
to be Lorenzo's chamber. Through the bed, you find
15 gold pieces scattered in some of the shelves

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:14.850
near the bed unit, beneath where there's the
platter containing the remains of some young

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:22.942
creature. Then beneath, tucked underneath the bed
and up into the slats, you find a heavy leather

00:35:22.942 --> 00:35:26.939
bag of some kind. You pull it out, and what you
find is--

00:35:26.939 --> 00:35:28.368
MARISHA: Nothing's trapped, right?

00:35:28.368 --> 00:35:32.365
MATT: You can check if you want to. Go ahead and
make an investigation check.

00:35:32.365 --> 00:35:33.522
SAM: Do you want me to check?

00:35:33.522 --> 00:35:34.500
MARISHA: Are you with me?

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.842
SAM: I was assisting.

00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:38.720
TRAVIS: That rogue shit.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.003
SAM: Investigation? 22.

00:35:43.003 --> 00:35:45.523
LAURA: You're not even drunk.

00:35:45.523 --> 00:35:53.737
MATT: Not trapped, just well hidden. You do find
this thick leather satchel. As you pull it back,

00:35:54.024 --> 00:36:01.381
it's well made. It has some stains on it, it looks
like. Some more of a crimson history, some that

00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:02.837
look like general dirt wear and tear.

00:36:02.837 --> 00:36:04.685
TRAVIS, MARISHA and MATT: Crimson.

00:36:04.685 --> 00:36:12.021
MATT: The stitching is really well done, and the
front of it looks like a face, the way it's designed.

00:36:12.494 --> 00:36:18.746
MARISHA: Does it have an open drawstring? Can I
look inside?

00:36:18.746 --> 00:36:23.635
MATT: It has a little flap that opens up, yeah.
You look inside and it looks like an empty bag.

00:36:23.635 --> 00:36:25.120
LIAM: Blue ink (puffing).

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.208
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:36:26.208 --> 00:36:28.934
TRAVIS: Maybe it's another haversack?

00:36:28.934 --> 00:36:33.121
MARISHA: Does it seem magical to you?

00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:35.057
SAM: Let me reach in.

00:36:35.057 --> 00:36:37.321
MARISHA: Okay. See how far you hand goes.

00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:41.835
SAM: I reach in and think of gold. See if I pull
it out.

00:36:41.835 --> 00:36:43.003
MATT: No gold.

00:36:43.003 --> 00:36:45.429
SAM: Did it feel cold in there or anything?

00:36:45.429 --> 00:36:50.811
MATT: The temperature felt consistent with the
temperature of the room you're in.

00:36:50.811 --> 00:36:51.796
LAURA: Did you reach the bottom?

00:36:51.796 --> 00:36:56.224
TRAVIS: I got an idea. I'll take one of these long
swords and I'll put it in the bag.

00:36:56.224 --> 00:36:59.402
SAM: Might just poke through the the thing. Why
don't we do something that won't poke through?

00:36:59.402 --> 00:37:00.610
TRAVIS: Too late. It's happening.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.337
MATT: It vanishes into the satchel.

00:37:03.337 --> 00:37:06.292
(gasping)

00:37:06.292 --> 00:37:07.424
TRAVIS: Motherfucker!

00:37:07.424 --> 00:37:09.351
MARISHA: What else could be in here?

00:37:09.351 --> 00:37:11.079
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's right.

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.380
SAM: I'm going to reach in and think of--

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.404
LAURA: (whispering) Doughnuts. Think of something
good to eat.

00:37:17.404 --> 00:37:18.463
SAM: Finger foods!

00:37:18.463 --> 00:37:22.055
MATT: Nothing comes out.

00:37:22.055 --> 00:37:27.864
LAURA: Think of something magical. Think of poop.

00:37:27.864 --> 00:37:31.191
SAM: I'm going to think of gems. Precious stones.

00:37:31.191 --> 00:37:34.488
MATT: You don't get any stones, no.

00:37:34.488 --> 00:37:39.490
LAURA: Think of jewelry. That was close, though.
Think of jewelry.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.306
SAM: How do you know that was close?

00:37:40.306 --> 00:37:41.322
LAURA: I feel like it was.

00:37:41.322 --> 00:37:43.080
MARISHA: Think of the heads of his enemies.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.620
SAM: I don't want to touch that.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:50.002
MARISHA: But what if they're in there? We don't
want to be walking around with heads.

00:37:50.002 --> 00:37:51.152
LAURA: I think of jewelry!

00:37:51.152 --> 00:37:53.575
MATT: No jewelry.

00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:56.361
MARISHA: He's looking at something. There's
something in there!

00:37:56.361 --> 00:37:58.124
TRAVIS: What's in it?!

00:37:58.124 --> 00:38:02.436
SAM: We'll take it to Caleb!

00:38:03.876 --> 00:38:09.813
LAURA: Here's the thing. I do know that with my
haversack-- where is it, by the way? Who has my haversack?

00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:11.225
SAM: We have it.

00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:13.633
MARISHA: I think Caleb has it, actually, yeah.

00:38:13.633 --> 00:38:17.744
MATT: Which is great too, when you see the dirty
coat and the giant, bright, hot pink haversack

00:38:17.744 --> 00:38:19.696
over the shoulder. It's a pretty great visual.

00:38:19.696 --> 00:38:21.468
LIAM: I was waiting for the right moment to give
it back.

00:38:21.468 --> 00:38:26.665
LAURA: If you cut the haversack, all of its
contents spill out.

00:38:26.665 --> 00:38:28.896
SAM: You could've ruined it! Oh, but wait--

00:38:28.896 --> 00:38:35.140
LAURA: From the outside. If you cut it from the
outside, if you pierce it, all of its stuff falls out.

00:38:35.527 --> 00:38:36.880
MARISHA: Can we repair after that?

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.197
LAURA: No, it's doneskies.

00:38:38.197 --> 00:38:40.227
SAM: Let's see what Caleb can do with it first.

00:38:40.227 --> 00:38:44.602
TRAVIS: True, yeah. Are there any books in his
room specifically for Caleb?

00:38:44.602 --> 00:38:54.096
MATT: Looking through, not much of a reader. Not a
lot of readers in here. The few that had any sort of

00:38:54.096 --> 00:39:01.839
magical persuasion, none of it was
knowledge-based. Most of it was instinct or

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:04.743
natural innate ability.

00:39:04.743 --> 00:39:06.777
TRAVIS: Piece of shit ability, is that what you
mean?

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:07.394
MATT: Sure.

00:39:07.394 --> 00:39:09.814
MARISHA: Douchebag ability.

00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:20.719
SAM: Can I go through and look around for any
papers or documents that would point to anyone

00:39:21.033 --> 00:39:23.877
else that he was working for or selling to?

00:39:23.877 --> 00:39:30.532
MATT: You guys did together. This is the next
hour, hour and a half of you guys going through as

00:39:30.532 --> 00:39:35.258
much as you can, as quickly as you can, because
you are still not supposed to be seen or found in

00:39:35.258 --> 00:39:40.157
connection with this. You all eventually gather
everything and come back to Caleb.

00:39:40.157 --> 00:39:46.956
LIAM: You find him-- while they were gone, Caleb,
holding the huge slash on his chest together, and

00:39:46.956 --> 00:39:54.303
the coat is ripped, laid down next to Yasha,
looking at the ceiling. After a long moment of

00:39:54.303 --> 00:39:57.809
silence, said: Oh, that's quite a day, ja?

00:39:57.809 --> 00:40:01.986
LAURA: You're injured? I didn't even know! Is
everybody injured?

00:40:01.986 --> 00:40:04.768
LIAM: I'm sorry we weren't faster.

00:40:04.768 --> 00:40:07.588
MARISHA: We're a little banged up, but we're
fine.

00:40:07.588 --> 00:40:09.576
LIAM and MARISHA: We're fine.

00:40:09.576 --> 00:40:12.211
LAURA: (whispering) Why was he talking to Yasha?

00:40:12.211 --> 00:40:13.436
TRAVIS: Heal, Jester.

00:40:13.436 --> 00:40:15.312
MARISHA: What time is it actually?

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:28.981
MATT: You would gather at this time it's maybe
close to three in the morning. Sunrise is not that

00:40:28.981 --> 00:40:30.144
far away.

00:40:30.144 --> 00:40:32.176
TRAVIS: Did we see Caduceus upstairs?

00:40:32.176 --> 00:40:35.408
MATT: Yeah, Caduceus is in the kitchen cooking,
and you begin to hear some pots rattle around, and

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:47.929
you smell some nice scents of fried herbs and
veggies and some other non-meat based food preparation.

00:40:47.929 --> 00:40:53.366
TRAVIS: Before we get back down to Caleb I say: do
you need a hand?

00:40:53.366 --> 00:40:56.185
TALIESIN: Oh no, I'm fine. I've got this. This is
no problem.

00:40:56.185 --> 00:41:00.694
TRAVIS: Oh. Okay. I'll go back down--

00:41:00.694 --> 00:41:03.864
TALIESIN: If you find anything that looks good to
eat, actually, bring it back up. I'll cook it

00:41:03.864 --> 00:41:05.586
right up. That's no problem.

00:41:05.586 --> 00:41:06.855
TRAVIS: From downstairs?

00:41:06.855 --> 00:41:12.168
TALIESIN: You never know. It's a good basement.
You could keep a lot of roots down there. It'd be

00:41:12.168 --> 00:41:12.859
very fresh.

00:41:12.859 --> 00:41:13.566
TRAVIS: Roots.

00:41:13.566 --> 00:41:18.276
TALIESIN: Potatoes, turnips, carrots. Roots.

00:41:18.276 --> 00:41:21.065
TRAVIS: Yeah, roots. Sure.

00:41:21.065 --> 00:41:22.744
TALIESIN: You've had a carrot before, right?

00:41:22.744 --> 00:41:24.169
TRAVIS: Yeah, no I've had a carrot.

00:41:24.169 --> 00:41:25.609
TALIESIN: Ah yeah that's good. They're really
good.

00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:30.246
TRAVIS: Do I smell anything in the-- no, it smells
like breakfast. Fuck it. I go back downstairs.

00:41:30.246 --> 00:41:36.849
(laughter)

00:41:36.849 --> 00:41:37.457
TRAVIS: Patchouli.

00:41:37.457 --> 00:41:40.403
(laughter)

00:41:40.403 --> 00:41:49.034
MARISHA: Hey, Matt? Question. Do I-- between me
and Caleb-- who has keen memory-- would we

00:41:49.034 --> 00:41:55.754
remember how many prisoners were in the stronghold
including these guys?

00:41:55.754 --> 00:41:56.983
MATT: Including these guys?

00:41:56.983 --> 00:41:58.676
LIAM: Caleb would know how many they've seen.

00:41:58.676 --> 00:42:02.981
MARISHA: And escaped. How many did we let go
including Shakäste?

00:42:02.981 --> 00:42:06.097
MATT: Including Shakäste, if I'm recalling...
Nine?

00:42:06.097 --> 00:42:07.470
LIAM: Nein?

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.969
MATT: Nine.

00:42:08.969 --> 00:42:15.767
MARISHA: Is that what "deliver goods polished"
means? Nine delivered? Okay, just making sure.

00:42:15.767 --> 00:42:19.277
TRAVIS: Yep. Polished...

00:42:19.277 --> 00:42:21.359
MARISHA: We have polished-- does that mean
like--?

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:22.026
TRAVIS: Erased.

00:42:22.026 --> 00:42:23.576
MARISHA: Beaten in? Yeah, erased.

00:42:23.576 --> 00:42:24.924
SAM: All right.

00:42:24.924 --> 00:42:25.736
MARISHA: Broken.

00:42:25.736 --> 00:42:27.770
SAM: Let's get the fuck out of here.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:32.018
TRAVIS: You don't want to get a little healing
first in case there are fucking hyenas outside or

00:42:32.018 --> 00:42:32.711
some shit?

00:42:32.711 --> 00:42:33.619
SAM: There's bears.

00:42:33.619 --> 00:42:35.134
TRAVIS: Oh that counts.

00:42:35.134 --> 00:42:36.446
SAM: There's bone bears.

00:42:36.446 --> 00:42:37.783
TRAVIS: Bone bears?

00:42:37.783 --> 00:42:39.522
LAURA: Caleb is slashed across his chest.

00:42:39.522 --> 00:42:42.091
SAM: There's also a road so we'll be okay.

00:42:42.091 --> 00:42:44.808
TALIESIN: Can I hear this conversation?

00:42:44.808 --> 00:42:46.433
SAM: Sure, we're around.

00:42:46.433 --> 00:42:49.715
TALIESIN: I'd recommend staying the night; you're
all pretty banged up.

00:42:49.715 --> 00:42:52.904
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say we do have cover
here, right?

00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:54.481
TALIESIN: There's even beds.

00:42:54.481 --> 00:42:58.614
SAM: What if they have others working with them
who come home?

00:42:58.614 --> 00:43:00.461
TRAVIS: That is a good point.

00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:02.372
MARISHA: Someone will keep watch.

00:43:02.372 --> 00:43:06.388
LAURA: That worked out really well for us last
time.

00:43:06.388 --> 00:43:08.314
TRAVIS: Okay, let's take it easy.

00:43:08.314 --> 00:43:11.473
LIAM: Are we all in the same room at this point?

00:43:11.473 --> 00:43:12.026
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:43:12.026 --> 00:43:13.854
MATT: At this point you guys have gathered
together we'll say.

00:43:13.854 --> 00:43:15.290
MARISHA: We handed you that haversack.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:19.159
LIAM: I have a-- Never mind, I'll tell you
tomorrow.

00:43:19.159 --> 00:43:21.235
LAURA: Cure Wounds.

00:43:21.235 --> 00:43:22.737
LIAM: This is-- Oh!

00:43:26.217 --> 00:43:28.522
LAURA: Because I'm a healer. I'm a really good
one.

00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:30.428
SAM: What's that new magic you used?

00:43:30.428 --> 00:43:34.446
(laughter)

00:43:34.446 --> 00:43:35.049
SAM: Amazing!

00:43:35.049 --> 00:43:37.399
LAURA: I know. It's pretty impressive.

00:43:37.399 --> 00:43:44.953
MARISHA: Healers are like cats. You have to have
two so they can keep each other motivated. So funny.

00:43:45.378 --> 00:43:46.975
TRAVIS: One's just fat and never moves.

00:43:46.975 --> 00:43:49.962
MARISHA: (laughing) Competition.

00:43:49.962 --> 00:43:52.053
LIAM: I have been carrying this for you.

00:43:52.053 --> 00:43:58.579
LAURA: My bag! Thank you, Caleb! Although, it
looks really good with your coat.

00:43:58.579 --> 00:43:59.363
LIAM: I know.

00:43:59.363 --> 00:44:02.078
LAURA: Thank you.

00:44:02.078 --> 00:44:03.425
LIAM: Looks better on you.

00:44:03.425 --> 00:44:06.189
TRAVIS: We didn't find any books upstairs, sorry.

00:44:06.189 --> 00:44:08.098
LIAM: No, I didn't think-- Thank you.

00:44:08.098 --> 00:44:11.937
SAM: We found a strange bag. Maybe, when you're
feeling a little better, you can look at it and

00:44:11.937 --> 00:44:13.650
tell us its magicalness.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.782
LIAM: Yep. Oh, now?

00:44:18.782 --> 00:44:20.900
SAM: Oh no, whenever you like.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.530
LIAM: Who has it?

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:29.227
LAURA: I hold my bag up to Caduceus-- Cad's hair.
Does it match?

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:35.839
LIAM: Okay, book out and on the floor and start
tracing the symbols on the floor and give me ten minutes.

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:40.807
MARISHA: I'm going to lay down and take a short
rest, as Beau's feeling rough.

00:44:40.807 --> 00:44:41.939
TALIESIN: There's food.

00:44:41.939 --> 00:44:45.064
MARISHA: Tired. I'm going to eat some of Caduceus's
food.

00:44:45.064 --> 00:44:50.142
MATT: Caduceus eventually comes and joins you
guys, with platters of all sorts of well-cooked,

00:44:50.142 --> 00:44:57.895
well-spiced, organic vegetables, and whatever else
you happen to have on you.

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.329
TALIESIN: It's D&amp;amp;D: Everything's organic!

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.262
MATT: True.

00:45:00.262 --> 00:45:02.184
MARISHA: Mushrooms, and beans.

00:45:02.184 --> 00:45:03.600
LIAM: Blood pudding.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.631
MARISHA: So good.

00:45:05.631 --> 00:45:06.816
LIAM: Mmm, coffee.

00:45:06.816 --> 00:45:08.573
MATT: So what are you casting, Caleb?

00:45:08.573 --> 00:45:09.231
LIAM: Hmm?

00:45:09.231 --> 00:45:10.315
MATT: What are you casting?

00:45:10.315 --> 00:45:11.200
LIAM: Oh, Identify.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.088
MATT: Identify, okay.

00:45:12.088 --> 00:45:15.462
LAURA: Whoa, it's long!

00:45:15.462 --> 00:45:17.440
TALIESIN: That's an epic poem right there.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.026
LIAM: You guys know what this is!

00:45:19.026 --> 00:45:19.501
SAM: No.

00:45:19.501 --> 00:45:20.377
LAURA: Is it?

00:45:20.377 --> 00:45:23.776
MARISHA: Is it the thing? Is it The Bag?

00:45:23.776 --> 00:45:25.434
LIAM: This is a bottomless bag.

00:45:25.434 --> 00:45:26.705
TRAVIS: Bottomless bag?

00:45:26.705 --> 00:45:28.000
SAM: Different from what we have?

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.032
MATT: Well, it's got a bottom.

00:45:29.032 --> 00:45:31.674
LIAM: It can hold a lot, though. It can hold a
lot. More than--

00:45:31.674 --> 00:45:32.900
LAURA: Can it hold more than mine?

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.350
LIAM: Yeah.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:38.708
LAURA: Well, then it's expensive. Because mine was
very pricey and it holds some stuff.

00:45:38.708 --> 00:45:40.366
TRAVIS: If you knew how to bargain, maybe.

00:45:40.366 --> 00:45:41.798
LAURA: What is that?

00:45:41.798 --> 00:45:43.823
LIAM: Who wants it?

00:45:43.823 --> 00:45:46.108
SAM: Who wants it?

00:45:46.108 --> 00:45:49.745
LAURA: Whoa! What happened? I mean, I know what
happened. Fuck.

00:45:49.745 --> 00:45:51.494
TRAVIS: How about I hold it for you?

00:45:51.494 --> 00:45:54.400
LIAM: Yeah. Tradition.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:59.504
TRAVIS: (singing) Tradition! Wow!

00:45:59.504 --> 00:46:01.994
LAURA: You can cook?

00:46:01.994 --> 00:46:08.561
TALIESIN: I definitely can cook. I mean, whether
or not it's any good, I'm not sure. But if

00:46:08.965 --> 00:46:10.075
everybody's happy with it.

00:46:10.075 --> 00:46:15.697
LIAM: What are we doing? Are we staying here, or
are we hitting the road?

00:46:15.697 --> 00:46:19.433
LAURA: I just start scarfing.

00:46:19.433 --> 00:46:21.718
MATT: Make sure you know everything it can do, so
you guys don't--

00:46:21.718 --> 00:46:24.396
MARISHA: Sorry. I was napping for a moment, what?

00:46:24.396 --> 00:46:27.779
LIAM: Badass, what do you want to do? Are we
staying here, or are we hitting the road?

00:46:27.779 --> 00:46:29.974
SAM: Well, you're the leader, Caleb. You tell us.

00:46:29.974 --> 00:46:31.079
LAURA: You're the leader?

00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:36.984
SAM: Oh yes! He took a position of authority while
you were gone, and he rose to the occasion.

00:46:36.984 --> 00:46:39.377
LAURA: Oh, that's wonderful, Caleb. I'm very proud
of you.

00:46:39.377 --> 00:46:46.602
TALIESIN: Ah, Mr. Caleb, you don't really look in
the state to travel, really. I mean, just to point

00:46:46.602 --> 00:46:49.538
it out, you've taken a bit of a beating today.

00:46:49.538 --> 00:46:52.382
LIAM: Well, I don't always look great, but point
taken.

00:46:52.382 --> 00:46:54.575
TALIESIN: There's a bed upstairs.

00:46:54.575 --> 00:46:56.706
MARISHA: I think we should stay here.

00:46:56.706 --> 00:47:00.318
LAURA: We can all sleep in the same bedroom and
you can put your wire thingy in front of it, and

00:47:00.318 --> 00:47:02.789
then we'll know if anyone tries to break in.

00:47:02.789 --> 00:47:06.125
MARISHA: We can drag mattresses down into the
living room, light a fire.

00:47:06.125 --> 00:47:07.883
SAM: Have a fort party?

00:47:07.883 --> 00:47:08.756
MARISHA: Fort party.

00:47:08.756 --> 00:47:13.255
LIAM: That's a good idea. I have a surprise for
you all.

00:47:13.255 --> 00:47:14.477
LAURA: What is it?

00:47:14.477 --> 00:47:18.319
LIAM: (shushing) (groaning) Oh, shit.

00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:23.376
TRAVIS: Is there light in where we are? Is there
torchlight or anything in the lower space?

00:47:23.376 --> 00:47:28.685
MATT: I think you guys are probably not hanging
down in the torture dungeon now, which has very

00:47:28.685 --> 00:47:35.040
low red light from occasional low-burning wall
sconces. The main chambers are well-lit with

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.777
torches in the hallway areas, and the interior
chambers are a little low-lit. So there is light;

00:47:39.777 --> 00:47:40.996
there's just not a lot.

00:47:40.996 --> 00:47:47.340
TRAVIS: Can I take the bag and hold it up under a
light source and look in, see if there's stuff

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.270
rumbling around and it just looks empty?

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.957
MATT: You look inside, and it looks pretty empty.

00:47:50.957 --> 00:47:53.426
TRAVIS: Can I shake it, does it make any noise?

00:47:53.426 --> 00:47:54.238
MATT: No noise.

00:47:54.238 --> 00:48:00.802
TRAVIS: I'll reach in and just grab the inside of
it and turn it out, see if there's stuff.

00:48:00.802 --> 00:48:07.696
MATT: Okay. As you pull the bag inside-out, it
jolts away from one side of your grasp, and a

00:48:07.696 --> 00:48:11.767
bunch of things spill out of it onto the ground.
(clattering, clanging)

00:48:11.767 --> 00:48:12.596
MARISHA: From the bag?

00:48:12.596 --> 00:48:13.485
MATT: From the bag.

00:48:13.485 --> 00:48:15.694
SAM and LAURA: How'd you do that? What is that?
What's in there? What was it?

00:48:15.694 --> 00:48:17.306
MARISHA: He just flipped it inside out!

00:48:17.306 --> 00:48:21.210
LIAM: Yeah, take all the hidden goodies inside.
It's a piñata.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.026
TRAVIS: Yeah. I have deep arcane ability.

00:48:25.026 --> 00:48:27.561
SAM: What is it? What'd we get?

00:48:27.561 --> 00:48:30.210
LAURA: Did you pierce it? Is it ruined forever
now?

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.486
TRAVIS: No, I just turned it inside out, and all
this shit poured out.

00:48:32.486 --> 00:48:33.033
MARISHA: Magic.

00:48:33.033 --> 00:48:34.796
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up a couple things.

00:48:34.796 --> 00:48:36.252
LIAM: Yer a wizard, Harry!

00:48:36.252 --> 00:48:41.075
TRAVIS: (Harry Potter voice) I'm a what? (Hagrid
voice) And a thumpin' good one, I'd wager.

00:48:41.075 --> 00:48:48.713
MATT: The heavy noise that draws you guys over to
this involves collecting 101 platinum pieces that

00:48:48.713 --> 00:48:49.604
were in the bag--

00:48:49.604 --> 00:48:52.007
(yelling)

00:48:52.007 --> 00:48:52.618
LAURA: Whoa!

00:48:52.618 --> 00:48:54.739
LIAM: We are dumbasses.

00:48:54.739 --> 00:48:57.409
MATT: Four additional sets of manacles.

00:48:57.409 --> 00:48:58.764
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:48:58.764 --> 00:49:00.114
LAURA: Those things-- those fucking things!

00:49:00.114 --> 00:49:01.525
MARISHA: Why do these things follow us
everywhere?

00:49:01.525 --> 00:49:03.586
LAURA: They're evil! Those are really evil!

00:49:03.586 --> 00:49:07.029
TALIESIN: The big villain for this campaign will
become Mister Manacle.

00:49:07.029 --> 00:49:10.457
LAURA: Did the lady ever say anything when she was
casting, or was it just touching?

00:49:10.457 --> 00:49:13.913
MATT: It was just casting a spell, and she wasn't
always touching it necessarily. She was just near

00:49:13.913 --> 00:49:15.336
it, and sometimes would touch it.

00:49:15.336 --> 00:49:17.212
LAURA: (growling)

00:49:17.212 --> 00:49:28.526
MATT: About two dozen teeth clatter to the ground,
from varying backgrounds, and levels of decay. A

00:49:28.526 --> 00:49:32.951
meat hook: a handheld meat hook. Looks a bit
rusted.

00:49:32.951 --> 00:49:33.718
LAURA: Gross.

00:49:33.718 --> 00:49:43.163
MATT: There is a red gem: a well-carved red gem
about that big, not quite a ruby, called a

00:49:43.163 --> 00:49:52.337
corundum gem. A sealed envelope-- a wax-sealed
envelope, but as part of the seal there's a coin

00:49:52.337 --> 00:49:53.965
pressed into the seal.

00:49:53.965 --> 00:49:56.924
LAURA: A special coin? What does the coin look
like?

00:49:56.924 --> 00:49:58.908
MATT: That's what it looks like.

00:49:58.908 --> 00:50:01.260
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck! Physical props!

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.620
MATT: In fact, you recognize it immediately. This
is called a galley.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.763
LAURA: This is a galley.

00:50:06.763 --> 00:50:11.775
MATT: A galley is specifically a gold piece that
is produced along the Menagerie Coast.

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:14.808
LAURA: Ooh, it even smells good. It smells like
home!

00:50:14.808 --> 00:50:17.493
SAM: Maybe we should open it.

00:50:17.493 --> 00:50:18.655
LAURA: Is it trapped?

00:50:18.655 --> 00:50:20.954
SAM: I will look at the coin for traps!

00:50:20.954 --> 00:50:22.407
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:50:22.407 --> 00:50:24.806
LIAM: Caleb is doing the silver wire while that
happens.

00:50:24.806 --> 00:50:25.382
SAM: 23!

00:50:25.382 --> 00:50:27.374
MATT: Okay. It does not appear to be trapped.

00:50:27.374 --> 00:50:28.755
LAURA: You guys, should I open it?

00:50:28.755 --> 00:50:30.428
MARISHA: Looks like there's a handprint on the
back.

00:50:30.428 --> 00:50:36.832
LAURA: Ew, is it blood? Does it look like blood,
or-- it looks like somebody spilled their hand in

00:50:36.832 --> 00:50:37.982
tea or coffee.

00:50:37.982 --> 00:50:43.408
MATT: It's a little more like the grease stain of
somebody who was holding it, not necessarily any

00:50:43.408 --> 00:50:50.334
bloodstain. Like Lorenzo maybe had grasped it
while a little greasy.

00:50:50.334 --> 00:50:51.131
LAURA: Should I open it?

00:50:51.131 --> 00:50:53.159
SAM: Yes! It could be a wedding invitation!

00:50:53.159 --> 00:50:56.830
LAURA: Okay, I did it already. Ooh!

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:58.739
TRAVIS: Oh my god, this is so awesome.

00:50:58.739 --> 00:51:07.102
LAURA: Oh goodness-- whoa, what is this thing?
There's a drawing on it. It's a really good drawing.

00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:08.448
MARISHA: Oh. It is a very good drawing.

00:51:08.448 --> 00:51:09.196
TRAVIS: That a peach?

00:51:09.196 --> 00:51:09.916
LIAM: It's a cantaloupe.

00:51:09.916 --> 00:51:15.251
LAURA: It's like a melon with a cut in it. Many
thanks to you-- What is that name?

00:51:15.251 --> 00:51:16.083
SAM: Jonas?

00:51:16.083 --> 00:51:18.513
LAURA: Ionos, I think is what it is.

00:51:18.513 --> 00:51:19.221
SAM: Maybe.

00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:20.081
MATT: It's an I.

00:51:20.081 --> 00:51:24.119
LAURA: "For dealing with the thieves who
appropriated my possession. Reliability like this

00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:30.259
"will prove profitable for you and your house,
should you continue to be. One half of our agreed

00:51:30.259 --> 00:51:37.072
"payment is enclosed--" (gasp) Is that what the
hundred platinum was? One half of it? "With the

00:51:37.072 --> 00:51:43.762
"other being paid upon recovery of the cloven
crystal--" I think that's what this thing is. "It is

00:51:43.762 --> 00:51:50.163
"imperative that you find this bauble and return it
to me. It has great sentimental value to me and my

00:51:50.163 --> 00:51:55.761
"family. This rendering should suffice to guide the
discerning eyes of your hunters."

00:51:55.761 --> 00:52:00.107
MARISHA: I pull out the red gem and hold it next
to the picture. Does it look like the same?

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:09.204
MATT: The red gem is just a square-shaped, hewed
gem. That looks like a crystal sphere with a

00:52:09.204 --> 00:52:12.013
giant, hacked crack across the front of it.

00:52:12.013 --> 00:52:16.534
SAM: "Time is of the essence, and should I not
have it by the end of--"

00:52:16.534 --> 00:52:18.316
MATT: It's really familiar to you, though.

00:52:18.316 --> 00:52:19.685
SAM: Queen... pillar? Queen's--

00:52:19.685 --> 00:52:21.214
LAURA: Quen'pillar?

00:52:21.214 --> 00:52:22.607
SAM: Quen'pillar? Is that a month? What is that?

00:52:22.607 --> 00:52:23.984
MATT: Quen'pillar is a month, yes. It's the next
month.

00:52:23.984 --> 00:52:25.143
LAURA: Yeah, we know that month.

00:52:25.143 --> 00:52:28.533
SAM: "Time is of the essence. Should I not have it
by the end of Quen'pillar, I will be forced to end

00:52:28.533 --> 00:52:34.413
"our agreement and seek a business relationship
elsewhere. I warn you: we are fiercely loyal to

00:52:34.413 --> 00:52:39.776
"those who appease us, and staunchly resentful to
those who do not."

00:52:39.776 --> 00:52:42.557
LAURA: And then he said, "Ah!" when he was writing
it, for sure.

00:52:42.557 --> 00:52:44.591
SAM: "When recovered, please deliver to--"

00:52:44.591 --> 00:52:50.255
LAURA: "Marius LePual at the Wayfarer's Cove."

00:52:50.255 --> 00:52:54.322
SAM: Thank you? No-- "Tell him you have a gift--"

00:52:54.322 --> 00:52:55.924
SAM and LAURA: "for the Captain."

00:52:55.924 --> 00:52:57.092
LAURA: And it's signed--

00:52:57.092 --> 00:52:59.170
SAM and LAURA: Evantica!

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:08.848
MATT: The Wayfarer's Cove you're also familiar
with. It's one of the three main shipping yards of Nicodranas.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.363
LAURA: That is-- you guys.

00:53:10.363 --> 00:53:18.535
SAM: What's the gist of this letter? Someone hired
someone to get some stuff back from a thief.

00:53:18.535 --> 00:53:25.624
There's more stuff. If they don't get it soon,
someone will be pissed off. Marius LePen?

00:53:25.624 --> 00:53:31.974
LAURA: Wait... Somebody hired-- Oops! Do you think
somebody hired Lorenzo to do this? Or do you think

00:53:31.974 --> 00:53:34.242
that Lorenzo stole this from somebody--

00:53:34.242 --> 00:53:37.915
TRAVIS: Jester, will you hold up that letter so
that I can see the drawing, please?

00:53:37.915 --> 00:53:39.583
LAURA: Do you recognize it, Fjord?

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:40.890
TRAVIS: Doesn't everybody?

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:46.223
LAURA: It looks kind of like a cantaloupe with a
hole in it--

00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:48.843
SAM: Oh yes! Yes, we saw one of these! It's in
your belly!

00:53:48.843 --> 00:53:51.573
LAURA: Is that what's in your belly?

00:53:51.573 --> 00:53:53.752
MATT: It's pretty damn close.

00:53:53.752 --> 00:53:55.494
MARISHA: Ah!

00:53:55.494 --> 00:53:56.847
TRAVIS: It looks like an eye.

00:53:56.847 --> 00:53:59.781
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait! We just need to return--

00:53:59.781 --> 00:54:02.590
SAM: Hold on, this letter was for you?! Are you
Marius LePen?

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:04.210
LAURA: Do you know Evantica?!

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:07.146
TRAVIS: I just sit down on the floor and lean back
against the wall.

00:54:07.146 --> 00:54:10.627
LAURA: Have you ever been to the Wayfarer's Cove?

00:54:10.627 --> 00:54:12.208
TRAVIS: No. Well--

00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:13.620
LAURA: I have. I've been there before.

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.766
TRAVIS: That's not true, I have.

00:54:14.766 --> 00:54:17.729
MARISHA: But you're from the Menagerie Coast,
that's when you guys met.

00:54:17.729 --> 00:54:18.673
TRAVIS: I've been there--

00:54:18.673 --> 00:54:20.501
LAURA: Yeah, but he wasn't in Nicodranas with me.

00:54:20.501 --> 00:54:23.535
TRAVIS: I've been to those harbors before. Many
times.

00:54:23.535 --> 00:54:27.471
LAURA: Wait wait wait! If we bring you there,
we'll get a hundred platinum, you think?

00:54:27.471 --> 00:54:28.893
SAM: Where did we find this?

00:54:28.893 --> 00:54:38.010
LIAM: Excuse me just a moment, I'm sorry. Does
anyone have a glass bead? Just a glass bead:

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:39.288
cheap, doesn't matter.

00:54:39.288 --> 00:54:40.326
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so.

00:54:40.326 --> 00:54:41.120
SAM: Glass bead?

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.968
LAURA: Do I have something on me? Would I have a
glass bead?

00:54:42.968 --> 00:54:47.408
LIAM: You have fifty rings; do you have a glass
bead? Necklaces, anything? Do you wear a glass

00:54:47.408 --> 00:54:48.295
bead on you?

00:54:48.295 --> 00:54:54.046
MARISHA: I gave my beaded bracelet to Nott. Nott,
you still have my beaded bracelet, right?

00:54:54.046 --> 00:54:55.471
SAM: Was it beaded? The jade bracelet?

00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:56.536
MARISHA: The jade beaded bracelet?

00:54:56.536 --> 00:54:57.471
LAURA: It's jade, it's not glass.

00:54:57.471 --> 00:54:58.156
LIAM: Do you have a bead?

00:54:58.156 --> 00:54:58.944
MARISHA: Would it work?

00:54:58.944 --> 00:55:06.476
SAM: I have shards of shiny pottery, silverware
from the fish people. Human jerky, a dead rat--

00:55:06.476 --> 00:55:09.658
TRAVIS: Human jerky? Where the fuck have you
guys been?

00:55:09.658 --> 00:55:11.078
SAM: A vase, some old flowers--

00:55:11.078 --> 00:55:14.884
LIAM: Your rings, do any of them have just a
glass-- are they costume jewelry?

00:55:14.884 --> 00:55:15.659
LAURA: Sure.

00:55:15.659 --> 00:55:18.780
LIAM: He pries it-- He's not very good at it.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.731
LAURA: Aw, man. I really liked the look of that.

00:55:20.731 --> 00:55:23.408
MATT: You bring out what looks to be
a really nice pearl.

00:55:23.408 --> 00:55:25.318
LIAM: Yeah, okay, good. Throws the ring away.

00:55:25.318 --> 00:55:27.727
LAURA: No, I can mend it! Caleb.

00:55:27.727 --> 00:55:33.090
LIAM: As you were. Then he starts muttering again
and walking around the circle that the silver wire makes.

00:55:33.491 --> 00:55:36.969
MATT: You get the sense that it's not a real
pearl. This is a pretty cheap piece of jewelry.

00:55:36.969 --> 00:55:41.043
SAM: Okay, wait. Let the masters work here.

00:55:41.043 --> 00:55:42.550
LAURA: Okay, let's figure this out.

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:45.892
SAM: Where did we see that? Where was that? Was
that in the tree? That was in the tree.

00:55:45.892 --> 00:55:47.651
LAURA: No, that was in that thing--

00:55:47.651 --> 00:55:48.925
TRAVIS: Down underneath, in the well.

00:55:48.925 --> 00:55:50.416
SAM: Underneath the tree, with the fish people.

00:55:50.416 --> 00:55:51.916
MARISHA and LAURA: With the fish people.

00:55:51.916 --> 00:55:53.721
MARISHA: They were like, worshiping it.

00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:54.698
TRAVIS: What do they call those people?

00:55:54.698 --> 00:55:55.630
MATT: They're called merrow.

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:56.170
TRAVIS: Merrow.

00:55:56.170 --> 00:56:03.199
SAM: Okay, so the merrow stole that from a water
place, right? The Way--

00:56:03.199 --> 00:56:06.073
LAURA: You just spit on this letter. I saw it
happen.

00:56:06.073 --> 00:56:07.333
SAM: I'm a goblin, I spit.

00:56:07.333 --> 00:56:11.833
LAURA: Did you know, Fjord, that the thing inside
of you is called the cloven crystal?

00:56:11.833 --> 00:56:13.846
SAM: Or the clover crystal?

00:56:13.846 --> 00:56:14.594
TRAVIS: No, I didn't.

00:56:14.594 --> 00:56:16.060
SAM: Cloven? cloven crystal.

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.597
LAURA: Well now we know something.

00:56:18.597 --> 00:56:21.862
SAM: And the merrow stole it from someone here.

00:56:21.862 --> 00:56:23.985
LAURA: Wait, do I know Marius LePule?

00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:28.626
MATT: You have no idea who that is. You've lived
in the town for a while, and you know a lot of

00:56:28.626 --> 00:56:33.241
things about the locations, but you haven't
traveled around Nicodranas. The people you know

00:56:33.241 --> 00:56:37.197
are those that have come in and out of where you
grew up, and that name does not ring a bell.

00:56:37.197 --> 00:56:38.939
Neither does the Captain.

00:56:38.939 --> 00:56:43.590
SAM: This is a mystery.

00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:46.135
LAURA: It is. We'll solve this.

00:56:46.135 --> 00:56:49.577
TRAVIS: Can I see it for just a second? I'll give
it right back.

00:56:49.577 --> 00:56:51.332
SAM: It's evidence! Wear gloves.

00:56:51.332 --> 00:56:54.522
LAURA: Make sure you don't get your fingerprints
all over it!

00:56:54.522 --> 00:57:00.150
MATT: I would like Caleb and Beauregard, and
Fjord, actually-- the three of you to roll

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:01.351
intelligence checks.

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:03.159
LAURA: Why not us? Why aren't we--

00:57:03.159 --> 00:57:07.528
LIAM: Caleb is not paying attention to anything
going on.

00:57:07.528 --> 00:57:09.044
MATT: That's true. So just Beauregard.

00:57:09.044 --> 00:57:09.580
TRAVIS: Seven.

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.723
MARISHA: Just straight intelligence?

00:57:11.723 --> 00:57:12.649
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:57:12.649 --> 00:57:19.075
MARISHA: Oh boy. Five.

00:57:19.075 --> 00:57:19.598
MATT: Okay.

00:57:19.598 --> 00:57:22.157
MARISHA: Bummer.

00:57:22.157 --> 00:57:26.503
LAURA: Would I roll an intelligence check?

00:57:26.503 --> 00:57:28.358
MATT: No.

00:57:28.358 --> 00:57:30.976
LAURA: Damn it. Is this a real coin?

00:57:30.976 --> 00:57:35.523
MATT: That is a real coin, yes. It is a gold coin;
if you'd like to take it off of the envelope, you

00:57:35.523 --> 00:57:36.859
may add one gold to your--

00:57:36.859 --> 00:57:39.128
LAURA: No, it's so pretty on the envelope,
though.

00:57:39.128 --> 00:57:41.369
SAM: Evantica?

00:57:41.369 --> 00:57:44.694
TRAVIS: Evan-tee-ca? Ev-ahn-tica?

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:49.554
LAURA: It really does smell like home.

00:57:49.554 --> 00:57:50.157
MARISHA: Ionos.

00:57:50.157 --> 00:57:54.153
SAM: The Captain. The Captain was the person who
stole it? No. What?

00:57:54.153 --> 00:57:56.283
LAURA: No, the Captain-- he has the letter, I
can't tell you.

00:57:56.283 --> 00:58:00.252
TRAVIS: "Tell him you have a gift for the Captain
when you see Marius--"

00:58:00.252 --> 00:58:01.640
LAURA: LePual.

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:12.635
TRAVIS: "LePual at the Wayfarer's Cove." (inhale)
Well, I have the cloven crystal. I do not have

00:58:12.635 --> 00:58:15.374
access to it at the moment.

00:58:15.374 --> 00:58:21.180
LAURA: I poke his belly. Do I feel a little hard
spot on it? Do I feel it? I rub it. Do I feel a

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:26.255
little circle on there? Little globe under the
armor there?

00:58:26.255 --> 00:58:27.781
TRAVIS: Please. Stop.

00:58:27.781 --> 00:58:29.822
MATT: Fjord is expecting.

00:58:29.822 --> 00:58:34.890
TRAVIS: Maybe we should have Caleb check out some
of these items. I mean, what if this meat hook,

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:35.694
like, you know--

00:58:35.694 --> 00:58:37.969
LIAM: He's muttering and walking in circles.

00:58:37.969 --> 00:58:41.425
TRAVIS: -- is magic; you throw it and it comes
back to you or some shit.

00:58:41.425 --> 00:58:45.181
LAURA: You should just try throwing it and see if
it comes back to you.

00:58:45.181 --> 00:58:48.821
MARISHA: Matt, what was the Cult of the Caustic
Heart? I'm trying to remember.

00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:49.535
MATT: Which one?

00:58:49.535 --> 00:58:50.876
MARISHA: Cult of the Caustic Heart?

00:58:50.876 --> 00:58:57.503
MATT: The Cult of the Caustic Heart. That was, if
I recall, with Calianna.

00:58:57.503 --> 00:58:58.793
LAURA: Ooh!

00:58:58.793 --> 00:59:01.795
MARISHA: Yep, yeah. Yep, that's exactly what that
was.

00:59:01.795 --> 00:59:06.593
TRAVIS: The two dozen teeth, are there any of the
tusk variety?

00:59:06.593 --> 00:59:14.658
MATT: Looking over them, it appears that one of
them would be similar to a tusk, yes.

00:59:14.658 --> 00:59:16.203
TRAVIS: Can I take that?

00:59:16.203 --> 00:59:16.872
MATT: Sure.

00:59:16.872 --> 00:59:24.395
LIAM: Everybody hears some muttering behind them
of words they don't understand, and then they hear

00:59:24.395 --> 00:59:31.367
Caleb say: Huaah! A large bubble goes (voom) in
the entire entryway, and there is a giant

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:41.112
half-dome of pale, orangish-brown energy; and then
you just see Caleb's head go "Hey, look what I

00:59:41.112 --> 00:59:42.561
"made!" (whoosh)

00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:43.504
SAM: What is it?

00:59:43.504 --> 00:59:44.377
TRAVIS: What is that?

00:59:44.377 --> 00:59:45.217
LAURA: Can we go into it?

00:59:45.217 --> 00:59:47.626
MARISHA: Are we going-- (gasps) Is it a dope
pillow fort?

00:59:47.626 --> 00:59:49.542
TRAVIS: Can we see through it?

00:59:49.542 --> 00:59:53.881
MATT: At the moment? Looking at the specifics of
this...

00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:56.710
LAURA: (shouting) Caleb, can you hear through it?

00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:57.524
LIAM: (shouting) Ja!

00:59:57.524 --> 00:59:58.918
LAURA: Can we come into it?

00:59:58.918 --> 00:59:59.947
LIAM: Only you!

00:59:59.947 --> 01:00:00.972
LAURA: Yeah!

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:01.815
SAM: Is there a door?

01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:04.616
LAURA: Do I just hit the side of it? How do I get
in?

01:00:04.616 --> 01:00:08.551
LIAM: No, you walk in and as soon as you're in and
look back where you came, you don't see what you

01:00:08.551 --> 01:00:12.365
walked through, you just see the room and
everybody around it. (whispering) They can all

01:00:12.365 --> 01:00:13.294
come in, but be quiet.

01:00:13.294 --> 01:00:20.667
LAURA: Okay. This is so cool! Well, you need
pillows in here, Caleb. This is really neat.

01:00:20.667 --> 01:00:25.057
SAM: I'm going to walk in. Did it work?

01:00:25.057 --> 01:00:25.673
LIAM: Hello.

01:00:25.673 --> 01:00:27.563
SAM: Hi! Ooh!

01:00:27.563 --> 01:00:29.514
TRAVIS: Does sound come out of it? Do I hear them
talking?

01:00:29.514 --> 01:00:30.029
SAM: Yeah!

01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:32.431
LIAM: Probably.

01:00:32.431 --> 01:00:33.702
SAM: Hi!

01:00:33.702 --> 01:00:36.007
TRAVIS: Are you okay?

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:42.637
LIAM: Yeah, you can't see us, but we can see you.
I've been working on this for weeks.

01:00:42.637 --> 01:00:44.113
LAURA: This is really cool!

01:00:44.113 --> 01:00:51.503
MATT: It looks like a solid dome of faintly
orange-ish brown colored energy and you can pass

01:00:51.503 --> 01:00:54.346
through it. It feels like there's nothing there
except for the temperature on the inside. It's

01:00:54.346 --> 01:00:55.462
nice and comfortable.

01:00:55.462 --> 01:01:01.623
LAURA: Can anybody come through, or only your
friends? Only people that you like.

01:01:01.623 --> 01:01:03.519
LIAM: You can come in.

01:01:03.519 --> 01:01:04.905
LAURA: That means you like me.

01:01:04.905 --> 01:01:06.867
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and push my hand
through.

01:01:06.867 --> 01:01:08.997
MATT: It goes through.

01:01:08.997 --> 01:01:10.209
LIAM: I pull Fjord in.

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:13.841
TRAVIS: (yells) Cool.

01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:21.522
LIAM: So the idea behind this is that if we sleep
in a field or something, nobody's going to come

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:23.522
and take us off to be tortured in the night.

01:01:23.522 --> 01:01:27.023
LAURA: I like that idea. A lot.

01:01:27.023 --> 01:01:31.670
LIAM: We can go through it, you can go through it,
I can go through it-- well, I have to stay inside

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:33.817
it, but (chair squeaks) excuse me.

01:01:33.817 --> 01:01:35.039
LAURA: Did you just fart?

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:39.852
SAM: Oh, now we're trapped in here with the fart!
It's like a big Dutch oven!

01:01:39.852 --> 01:01:47.268
TRAVIS: Oh god it's magnified. It's unbelievable!
Human jerky!

01:01:47.268 --> 01:01:53.582
LIAM: I have bigger ideas for a big place, but I
can't... But this I can do!

01:01:53.582 --> 01:01:54.842
SAM: It's a starter house, right?

01:01:54.842 --> 01:01:55.474
LIAM: A yurt.

01:01:55.474 --> 01:01:56.380
SAM: Yeah.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.700
LAURA: I like it, it's cozy.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.200
SAM: I like it, too.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:07.382
LIAM: It feels like outside, but, you know. Also,
if we're ever in a tight spot and we know something--

01:02:07.852 --> 01:02:11.433
LAURA: (devious chuckling)

01:02:11.433 --> 01:02:12.394
TRAVIS: First game back.

01:02:12.394 --> 01:02:13.002
MARISHA: Yep.

01:02:13.002 --> 01:02:18.607
LIAM: I don't know if I'm looking at Laura or
Jester-- if we're ever in a tight spot, I can also

01:02:18.607 --> 01:02:23.591
do this if we are in real danger. That's a little
tricky because it takes some time to do it.

01:02:23.591 --> 01:02:29.080
SAM: Yes. It's brilliant. I love it! Caduceus,
come check it out.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.274
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk in. Yeah, this is
really nice.

01:02:32.274 --> 01:02:37.641
(laughter)

01:02:37.641 --> 01:02:40.098
SAM: How tall is he? Is his head touching the
ceiling?

01:02:40.098 --> 01:02:41.693
TRAVIS: Yeah, how tall is Caduceus?

01:02:41.693 --> 01:02:42.309
TALIESIN: Tall.

01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:43.237
LAURA: How tall?

01:02:43.237 --> 01:02:45.485
TALIESIN: About seven feet tall.

01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:49.054
MATT: Yeah, he's a tall fellow.

01:02:49.054 --> 01:02:50.876
SAM: How tall is the roof in here?

01:02:50.876 --> 01:02:52.532
LIAM: Like a hundred feet up, I think.

01:02:52.532 --> 01:02:56.046
MATT: The dome is about a ten foot radius.

01:02:56.046 --> 01:02:58.288
TALIESIN: So ten feet at the top.

01:02:58.288 --> 01:03:07.793
LIAM: I couldn't make any furniture yet. But
anyway, in a pinch, and tonight. And the alarm is up.

01:03:08.271 --> 01:03:10.159
SAM: You can do both at the same time?

01:03:10.159 --> 01:03:11.336
LIAM: It's been done, Nott.

01:03:11.336 --> 01:03:13.640
SAM: You're incredible!

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:18.339
MARISHA: Beau goes out, grabs a bunch of pillows
from the couches and starts throwing them in.

01:03:18.339 --> 01:03:21.613
MATT: A voice on the outside goes, "Uh, where'd
everyone go?"

01:03:21.613 --> 01:03:23.216
SAM: Oh, sorry.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.220
LAURA: Who's that?

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.088
SAM: That's Keg, probably. Keg, we're in here!

01:03:27.088 --> 01:03:28.041
MARISHA: Hey, Keg.

01:03:28.041 --> 01:03:29.852
MATT: Can she come in?

01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:31.010
LIAM: Of course.

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:40.935
MATT: Keg steps in. You see the dirt smeared side
of the face of this really intense, square-jawed

01:03:40.935 --> 01:03:45.962
dwarf woman with what was once five o'clock shadow
that is now coming into some decent stubble now.

01:03:45.962 --> 01:03:54.363
Short, reddish brown hair. Currently in the last
elements of a hand rolled cigarette, in full

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.708
armor, smattered with blood.

01:03:55.708 --> 01:04:05.644
LIAM: I can't make a side bubble, so-- I don't
mean to intrude, but what you said--

01:04:05.644 --> 01:04:07.470
MARISHA: Stop talking to me, Caleb.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.480
MATT: "Hey, so I guess we saved you?"

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.833
LAURA: You helped?

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:19.383
MATT: (doubtful groans)

01:04:19.383 --> 01:04:20.584
SAM: Yeah, she fought bravely.

01:04:20.584 --> 01:04:21.620
TALIESIN: Quite a bit.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.112
LAURA: Thank you.

01:04:23.112 --> 01:04:25.155
TRAVIS: Appreciate you.

01:04:25.155 --> 01:04:30.348
LAURA: I don't know what would have happened
without you guys. Really.

01:04:30.348 --> 01:04:36.369
SAM: You would have been tortured and brainwashed.
Sold and probably killed in a few months in a horrible--

01:04:36.624 --> 01:04:39.915
LAURA: I don't know. I feel like I would be really
nice to have around the house. People might have

01:04:39.915 --> 01:04:40.885
kept me around.

01:04:40.885 --> 01:04:41.439
TRAVIS: Well.

01:04:41.439 --> 01:04:45.332
MARISHA: That's not-- That doesn't make anything
better.

01:04:45.332 --> 01:04:49.525
SAM: But thank you, Keg. You were amazing.

01:04:53.745 --> 01:04:57.917
MATT: "I'm just happy to make up for past
mistakes."

01:04:57.917 --> 01:05:03.666
LAURA: I drag Yasha's body into the thing with
us.

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:10.536
TRAVIS: I'll go gather up the money and the teeth
and the meat hook and the red gem and all that

01:05:10.536 --> 01:05:13.317
shit in the bag. And then turn it back out.

01:05:13.317 --> 01:05:18.755
MATT: Teeth and coin and gem all come clattering
into the middle of your circle.

01:05:18.755 --> 01:05:22.466
TRAVIS: I brought you stuff to identify.

01:05:22.466 --> 01:05:30.312
LIAM: That's a lot. I will spend the next hour or
so before bed going through every single thing

01:05:30.372 --> 01:05:32.285
slowly and methodically with my spellbook.

01:05:32.285 --> 01:05:38.716
MATT: The potion that you found earlier is
magical.

01:05:38.716 --> 01:05:44.617
LIAM: And that gem that you had, Beauregard. The
red gem.

01:05:44.617 --> 01:05:46.115
MATT: The red gem is also magical.

01:05:46.115 --> 01:05:46.644
MARISHA: Yes!

01:05:46.644 --> 01:05:52.265
MATT: The sets of manacles emit a faint magical
aura.

01:05:52.265 --> 01:05:56.661
MARISHA: All the things! Yes!

01:05:56.661 --> 01:06:00.204
SAM: What did we get?

01:06:00.204 --> 01:06:01.555
LIAM: Leave me alone, I'm reading.

01:06:01.555 --> 01:06:02.180
SAM: Okay.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.005
TRAVIS: Meat hook?

01:06:04.005 --> 01:06:05.722
MATT: Meat hook is not magical.

01:06:05.722 --> 01:06:06.540
TRAVIS: Damn it.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:10.010
LIAM: This has great power.

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:11.225
SAM: What is it?

01:06:11.225 --> 01:06:12.113
LIAM: It's a meat hook.

01:06:12.113 --> 01:06:15.140
TRAVIS: What's it do?

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:19.199
LAURA: You look really scary with it on you.

01:06:19.199 --> 01:06:28.855
SAM: Whoa! It's probably been through people's
skulls, actually.

01:06:28.855 --> 01:06:30.367
TRAVIS: Yeah, probably.

01:06:30.367 --> 01:06:38.659
SAM: I'll take it. You said there was lots of
shortbows and longbows? Arrows?

01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:39.785
TRAVIS: Six shortswords.

01:06:39.785 --> 01:06:40.775
SAM: Bolts?

01:06:40.775 --> 01:06:46.693
MATT: There are bolts. If you wanted to restock,
there's probably close to 300 bolts.

01:06:46.693 --> 01:06:51.857
SAM: I'll fill up. Also, I'll take some arrows as
well.

01:06:51.857 --> 01:06:54.225
MATT: Probably about a hundred arrows.

01:06:54.225 --> 01:06:56.492
MARISHA: Anything I can throw?

01:06:56.492 --> 01:07:02.544
MATT: I'd say yeah. If you're looking around I say
you find an errant dagger or two.

01:07:02.544 --> 01:07:05.703
MARISHA: I'll take an errant dagger or two.

01:07:05.703 --> 01:07:06.876
MATT: Two daggers.

01:07:06.876 --> 01:07:07.845
MARISHA: Two daggers.

01:07:07.845 --> 01:07:11.122
MATT: Not too difficult to locate in this space.

01:07:11.122 --> 01:07:15.319
LIAM: Is this what Yasha had on her? Yeah.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.895
SAM: All right. Should we go to sleep?

01:07:29.995 --> 01:07:32.602
TRAVIS: I'll make sure Caleb's square.

01:07:32.602 --> 01:07:39.627
LIAM: No, we're good. This potion will give you a
silver tongue for an hour or so.

01:07:39.627 --> 01:07:42.022
LAURA: Like you'll be a really good talker?

01:07:42.022 --> 01:07:53.697
LIAM: Yeah, like this one over here. Or made this
one inhuman. I'll come back to this. This is the

01:07:53.697 --> 01:08:02.856
manacles Yasha had on her when we found her. This
is strange, you put them on a person and someone

01:08:02.856 --> 01:08:09.765
like me, maybe Fjord, could make that person fall
asleep for at least a day.

01:08:09.765 --> 01:08:13.657
LAURA: That's what all of us were wearing, dude.

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:16.772
LIAM: Well, now we have it.

01:08:16.772 --> 01:08:21.346
LAURA: What do I say to make them fall asleep?

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:24.171
LIAM: Nothing.

01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:26.821
LAURA: I don't want it.

01:08:26.821 --> 01:08:33.711
MATT: Glancing over the chains, you can only begin
to fathom how many people have been put in that set.

01:08:33.962 --> 01:08:35.694
LAURA: I don't want it at all.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:38.136
LIAM: I pocket it.

01:08:38.136 --> 01:08:39.776
MATT: It's pretty big.

01:08:39.776 --> 01:08:40.983
LIAM: What is it?

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:43.619
MATT: It's a set of manacles. It's like two wrist
manacles--

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:46.919
LIAM: How big is it?

01:08:46.919 --> 01:08:51.775
MATT: It's two cuffs for the wrists that goes
behind the back, and then two cuffs that go around

01:08:51.775 --> 01:09:00.840
the ankles, and then chains that connect them.
It's maybe about 15, 20 pounds of metal.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.832
LIAM: (southern accent) I was thinking oversized
handcuffs, but nevermind.

01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:06.756
LAURA: (southern accent) That can go in the bag of
holding for sure. Or the bottomless bag.

01:09:06.756 --> 01:09:19.604
LIAM: You got that. You can have this, this is a
gem that can summon a creature of fire.

01:09:19.604 --> 01:09:20.435
MARISHA: What?

01:09:20.435 --> 01:09:22.772
TRAVIS: A creature of fire?

01:09:22.772 --> 01:09:31.186
LIAM: Yeah. That is amazing. That is powerful.

01:09:34.676 --> 01:09:38.956
MARISHA: I mean, I feel like fire is kind of your
thing. You sure you want me to have this?

01:09:41.776 --> 01:09:43.622
LIAM: It's not my thing.

01:09:43.622 --> 01:09:45.863
LAURA: It kind of is your thing.

01:09:48.473 --> 01:09:50.480
LIAM: Not me and me alone.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:57.279
MARISHA: That's true, there are like four
elements. Means you're going to be sharing a lot.

01:09:57.279 --> 01:09:59.823
There's going to be a lot of overlap.

01:10:02.023 --> 01:10:02.974
LIAM: I'm good.

01:10:02.974 --> 01:10:06.423
MARISHA: Yeah. I'll hold on to it.

01:10:06.423 --> 01:10:15.765
MATT: You guys all resting up for the evening? As
the sun is right about now, Caleb, rising. It's

01:10:16.009 --> 01:10:17.338
about 5:30 in the morning.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:18.532
LIAM: Is it? Ooh.

01:10:18.532 --> 01:10:20.778
MATT: You guys have been doing all this through
the night.

01:10:20.778 --> 01:10:22.536
TRAVIS: Are we taking a long rest?

01:10:22.536 --> 01:10:25.500
LIAM: Yeah. Sleep until the afternoon.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:30.272
TRAVIS: Before I turn in, can I sit with Molly's
sword?

01:10:30.272 --> 01:10:30.985
MATT: Yeah.

01:10:30.985 --> 01:10:47.272
TRAVIS: Staring at it. Thank you, you were very
kind to me. I hope to do right by you and make it

01:10:47.272 --> 01:10:52.016
up to you one day. And I'll try to concentrate on
the sword.

01:10:52.016 --> 01:11:06.007
MATT: Okay. As you focus and attune to the weapon,
you feel the essence of the blade that you had

01:11:06.007 --> 01:11:18.870
previously bound yourself to begin to slip. Faint,
interior rumbling of your ribcage begins to feel

01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:26.004
like a heavy bass that is quaking on the inside of
your torso. It's uncomfortable at first, and then

01:11:26.004 --> 01:11:35.255
you realize it's this burrowing, for lack of a
better term, appetite with the previous weapon now

01:11:35.255 --> 01:11:42.973
gone and that void, that hunger, focusing in.
You're looking at the blade and you blink and as

01:11:42.973 --> 01:11:51.333
your eyes open, that shadowed depths are around
you once more. You look around for an instant and

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:59.860
all you see is the deep, dark recesses of some
endless ocean. You look down at the blade in your

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:09.634
grasp, the Summer's Dance blade, and then blink
once more and you're back in the chamber and it's

01:12:09.634 --> 01:12:11.425
gone from your hand.

01:12:13.155 --> 01:12:14.639
SAM: The blade's gone?

01:12:14.639 --> 01:12:15.206
MATT: Yeah.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:19.013
LAURA: Dude, you just swallowed that thing whole.
Like totally.

01:12:19.013 --> 01:12:30.185
MATT: You guys watched as he focused on it over
time, the blade seemed to fade away. It looks like

01:12:30.185 --> 01:12:36.476
the exterior begins to turn to ash and crumble,
but then nothing hits the ground below it. Then

01:12:36.476 --> 01:12:37.102
it's gone.

01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:38.420
LIAM: We all saw this?

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.877
MATT: All those who were paying attention and
hadn't gone to sleep yet.

01:12:41.877 --> 01:12:51.014
MARISHA: Where does all this stuff inside of you
go? You have so much extra storage space in you.

01:12:51.014 --> 01:12:55.241
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm kind of like this bag of
holding, huh?

01:12:55.241 --> 01:12:55.823
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:12:55.823 --> 01:13:08.018
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't know. I want to keep Molly
with us, though. With me.

01:13:08.018 --> 01:13:11.086
MARISHA: I know what you mean.

01:13:15.286 --> 01:13:24.374
MATT: With that awkward silence, you see Keg
staring straight out, the guilt on the face of the

01:13:24.631 --> 01:13:34.354
mention of Molly once more. "I'm going to have
to-- I'm just going to leave you guys to rest. I'm

01:13:34.354 --> 01:13:41.062
"going to take some me time." Then backs out of the
dome and one quick glance at Beau as she exits.

01:13:41.062 --> 01:14:01.015
MARISHA: I poke my head out and I go: You owe me a
night! And I go back in. I pop back in and I go:

01:14:01.015 --> 01:14:04.199
I'll be back in like an hour and 20 minutes.

01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:06.778
TRAVIS: Why don't you make it two hours?

01:14:06.778 --> 01:14:11.121
MARISHA: If it's two hours, don't come looking for
me. If it's two and a half, then get worried.

01:14:11.121 --> 01:14:12.249
TRAVIS: You're explaining too much.

01:14:12.249 --> 01:14:14.470
MARISHA: All right. Follow Keg.

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:15.038
MATT: Okay.

01:14:16.268 --> 01:14:20.873
LAURA: Can I look in the haversack? Is my
sketchbook still in there?

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.080
MATT: Your sketchbook is.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:32.817
LAURA: Going to get out my sketchbook and I'm
going to leave the little bubble for a little bit

01:14:33.194 --> 01:14:44.856
and wander out and I see Beau and Keg. I wander a
little further away and I sit down with my sketchbook.

01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:49.531
MARISHA: You just see blankets. It's like when the
Sims.

01:14:49.531 --> 01:14:53.325
LIAM: You just see a windmill of legs.

01:14:53.325 --> 01:15:06.868
LAURA: "Woohoo." I'm going to try to think of what
to draw for the last few days to tell The Traveler

01:15:06.868 --> 01:15:24.940
about, but I don't really know what to draw.
Instead I just write: "Well, why didn't you come?"

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:34.782
And then I close the book. I go back inside after
a little bit.

01:15:34.782 --> 01:15:52.379
MATT: Okay. You all finish a very necessary long
night's rest. Coming to consciousness as the dome

01:15:52.841 --> 01:16:02.064
vanishes, exposing the center of the base floor
walkway, where Caleb had set up both the

01:16:02.064 --> 01:16:07.620
protections of his spells and the dome in the
first place. Beau has not returned.

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.660
TRAVIS: Atta girl.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:18.173
MATT: You all wake up. The front door which is
right across from where you are is partially ajar,

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:20.122
partway open.

01:16:20.122 --> 01:16:26.239
LIAM: I go outside and get some fresh air and see
what I see.

01:16:26.239 --> 01:16:28.081
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

01:16:28.081 --> 01:16:34.429
LIAM: 17.

01:16:34.429 --> 01:16:48.515
MATT: You walk outside. It's early afternoon now.
It's chilly. Snowfall has set in now, and there

01:16:48.515 --> 01:16:53.050
is a faint snowfall over the entire grounds of the
interior of this courtyard where the trees have

01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:59.159
been cleared for the construction of The Sour
Nest, is just white. You see it gathering up on

01:16:59.159 --> 01:17:03.746
the tops of the walls on the outside. It's almost
beautiful, if not for the connotation of where you

01:17:03.746 --> 01:17:09.482
are. All around you, on the outskirts of the wall
you can see where the white is dusting over the

01:17:09.482 --> 01:17:15.619
purple and grays of the Savalierwood that
surrounds you. You do notice, across the way, the

01:17:15.619 --> 01:17:21.251
open gates on the southern side of the wall that
enters into the courtyard are also partially ajar.

01:17:21.251 --> 01:17:28.018
You see faint footsteps leading from the gate to
where you are.

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:31.344
LIAM: Are they deep, heavy dwarf footprints?

01:17:31.344 --> 01:17:33.227
MATT: They are, and they're heading away from
you.

01:17:33.227 --> 01:17:40.648
LIAM: I rub my thumb along the lucky rock in my
pocket, and smile at the snow and think about

01:17:40.648 --> 01:17:47.569
playing in it when I was younger, and go inside to
wake up anyone who's still sleeping.

01:17:47.569 --> 01:17:55.776
MATT: Okay. Beau, at one point you did wake up
this morning. Halfheartedly, as some people aren't

01:17:55.776 --> 01:17:58.877
as stealthy in their exits as others.

01:17:58.877 --> 01:18:01.314
LIAM: Cling clang, clung clung!

01:18:01.314 --> 01:18:09.650
MATT: Open one eye and glance over, and the door
closes.

01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:14.855
MARISHA: I chuckle and roll over and go back to
sleep. Smile as I dig into my pillow.

01:18:14.855 --> 01:18:27.136
MATT: All right. You all come to consciousness as
Caleb wakes you. On the outskirts of the dome by

01:18:27.136 --> 01:18:32.051
where Nott was sleeping, there is a tiny little
piece of paper.

01:18:32.051 --> 01:18:51.657
SAM: Oh, it's a note! For me! It's really badly
written. It's like Frankenstein wrote a letter.

01:18:51.657 --> 01:18:54.117
LIAM: Name is spelled wrong, too.

01:18:57.547 --> 01:18:59.095
LAURA: "Sory."

01:18:59.095 --> 01:19:09.546
SAM: Should I read it to you guys? It says, "Nott,
sorry for going before you woke up. Bad at

01:19:09.546 --> 01:19:16.310
"goodbyes, never really had friends before. Yuto
was my only friend, but now you and I are friends.

01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:28.102
"This medalon, medalion, medallon-- this
thing, was from Yuto. It will protect you. Thank

01:19:28.102 --> 01:19:33.133
"you for helping me. Keg. P.S. If anyone hurts you
I will kill them." "Kill" is spelled wrong.

01:19:33.133 --> 01:19:40.116
MATT: There is, underneath the paper where you
pulled it away, you saw it was a medallion that

01:19:40.116 --> 01:19:51.620
was hanging from the bottom of her warhammer. It
has a symbol of a star or a sun of multiple points

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.988
sticking out on all sides.

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:57.215
SAM: I'll take it and put it around my neck.

01:19:57.215 --> 01:19:58.090
MATT: All right.

01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:01.007
SAM: I am now invincible.

01:20:01.007 --> 01:20:11.952
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Medallion of cigar smoke.
Medallion of stogies.

01:20:11.952 --> 01:20:13.716
MARISHA: Medallion of five o'clock shadow.

01:20:13.716 --> 01:20:19.177
MATT: Have to have one character in every campaign
that grows facial hair for no reason.

01:20:19.177 --> 01:20:20.618
TRAVIS: You fucking know it.

01:20:20.618 --> 01:20:24.686
LIAM: A charmed bracelet of dwarvenkind? Just gets
a little bit of stubble.

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:29.086
LAURA: Did you cast Identify on the ruby thingy at
all?

01:20:29.086 --> 01:20:31.958
TRAVIS: Yeah, I didn't do nothing.

01:20:32.701 --> 01:20:34.756
MATT: Beau, you wake up and there is a letter.

01:20:34.756 --> 01:20:37.584
TRAVIS: Fucking secret Santa in this bitch!

01:20:37.584 --> 01:20:39.337
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:20:39.337 --> 01:20:42.757
TALIESIN: I hope it's a terrible drawing of some--
sorry.

01:20:42.757 --> 01:20:48.025
MARISHA: You guys, I've never gotten morning
after--

01:20:48.025 --> 01:20:55.937
(laughter)

01:20:55.937 --> 01:20:58.990
TRAVIS: (wheezing) That's fucking great!

01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:01.654
MARISHA: It's almost as good as the Kerrek letter,
you guys!

01:21:01.654 --> 01:21:02.973
TRAVIS: The immediate regret!

01:21:02.973 --> 01:21:07.359
(laughter)

01:21:07.359 --> 01:21:12.424
MARISHA: Hang on, you've got to have the full
experience. First off, "For Bo," spelled wrong.

01:21:12.424 --> 01:21:18.366
SAM: (reading) "Bo," everything's crossed out,
"Thanks."

01:21:18.366 --> 01:21:21.910
(laughter)

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:24.845
MATT: Those letters were actually written by Ashly
Burch for you guys.

01:21:24.845 --> 01:21:27.439
TRAVIS: Oh yeah?! Oh, amazing.

01:21:27.439 --> 01:21:28.466
MATT: Yeah.

01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:29.750
MARISHA: "I love--"

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.195
TRAVIS: You can see it!

01:21:31.195 --> 01:21:40.472
MARISHA: You can see it! She was trying to write,
"Your eyes are beautiful when you smile. I love-- Thanks."

01:21:40.472 --> 01:21:45.682
(laughter)

01:21:45.687 --> 01:21:46.665
LIAM: Amazing.

01:21:46.665 --> 01:21:50.326
MARISHA: I'll cherish this forever.

01:21:50.326 --> 01:22:04.824
TRAVIS: I forgot to ask. Before we do anything
else, Lorenzo's glaive, his weapon, did we get that?

01:22:05.219 --> 01:22:08.805
MATT: It was left below, yeah.

01:22:08.805 --> 01:22:12.067
MARISHA: I feel like we grabbed it, right?

01:22:12.067 --> 01:22:16.922
MATT: Yeah, you have it. It's a wicked looking
weapon.

01:22:16.922 --> 01:22:18.700
LIAM: Just give it to me.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.155
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go grab it and give it to
Caleb.

01:22:21.155 --> 01:22:25.854
LIAM: (muttering)

01:22:25.854 --> 01:22:27.205
MATT: It is not magical.

01:22:27.205 --> 01:22:33.411
LIAM: That is magical, in that it is very finely
crafted. But it doesn't do anything expect cut me

01:22:33.411 --> 01:22:35.489
across the chest quite deeply.

01:22:35.489 --> 01:22:42.563
TRAVIS: If it had spelled the end of one of my
closest friends I know I would want it, so we

01:22:42.563 --> 01:22:49.131
should probably keep it for Yasha when she wakes.
In the Bag of Holding.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:53.974
LAURA: Whoa, that bag is way better than my bag.

01:22:53.974 --> 01:22:55.264
TRAVIS: It's pretty big.

01:22:55.264 --> 01:22:57.658
LAURA: We could always dye that one pink too.

01:22:57.658 --> 01:22:58.864
TRAVIS: We don't have to do that.

01:22:58.864 --> 01:23:01.141
TALIESIN: I can help with that.

01:23:01.141 --> 01:23:02.838
LAURA: You can?

01:23:02.838 --> 01:23:04.066
TALIESIN: Yeah, probably.

01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:05.883
LAURA: You can dye things colors?

01:23:05.883 --> 01:23:12.885
TALIESIN: I mean, possibly it could work. I don't
know, yeah maybe. Probably.

01:23:12.885 --> 01:23:16.439
LIAM: We have a long way to walk, so is that what
we're doing?

01:23:16.439 --> 01:23:17.810
SAM: Where are we going?

01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:24.475
LAURA: Oh! We have to finish the thing for The
Gentleman, oh my gosh!

01:23:24.475 --> 01:23:28.440
MARISHA: It's okay. We already got in touch.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:32.555
LIAM: But also we should go back to Ophelia
Mardun.

01:23:32.555 --> 01:23:38.024
MARISHA: With Ophelia Mardun, who was-- yes that's
what I was about to say.

01:23:38.024 --> 01:23:39.688
TRAVIS: Glad you guys are keeping track.

01:23:39.688 --> 01:23:41.495
LAURA: How much time do we left on that thing?

01:23:41.495 --> 01:23:47.146
MARISHA: We're doing okay. We already got in touch
with Ophelia, who is the woman we were supposed to

01:23:47.146 --> 01:23:53.536
get in contact with. We were like a day or so
late, but she was fine with it. But she wanted us

01:23:53.536 --> 01:24:02.122
to go kill Lorenzo and the rest of the Iron
Shepherds, so it was a very convenient killing one

01:24:02.122 --> 01:24:04.406
group of slavers with one stone.

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:10.183
LAURA: Oh, so you didn't really come to save us.
You came to get the money.

01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:14.203
SAM: No, no! We came to save you, the money's the
bonus.

01:24:14.203 --> 01:24:17.785
LAURA: I know, Nott! I know you did. I was just
joking with you.

01:24:17.785 --> 01:24:21.179
LIAM: No, it is true. The money meant fuck all.

01:24:21.179 --> 01:24:25.308
TALIESIN: This is literally the first they've
mentioned it in my presence, so.

01:24:25.308 --> 01:24:27.481
LAURA: That means you get all of the money.

01:24:27.481 --> 01:24:29.601
TALIESIN: Eh, I'm fine.

01:24:29.601 --> 01:24:37.151
LAURA: Everybody's so generous here! You can give
me all of the platinum, then. I don't mind.

01:24:37.151 --> 01:24:42.932
LIAM: No, that is incorrect. I would like my share
of the platinum to be sure. Any coin that we

01:24:42.932 --> 01:24:43.821
found, please.

01:24:43.821 --> 01:24:46.871
SAM: Divide it up now?

01:24:46.871 --> 01:24:53.281
TRAVIS: Caduceus, can I ask what your involvement
is? How you became involved in this?

01:24:53.281 --> 01:25:00.962
TALIESIN: I'll go so far as to say I feel that the
fates have intertwined us for a while. I need to

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:03.528
head east at some point.

01:25:03.528 --> 01:25:04.697
LIAM: What is east?

01:25:04.697 --> 01:25:15.620
TALIESIN: I don't know. But I'm going to find out.
Everything's telling me that I should stick around

01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:20.500
and see where you're headed. I think that's where
I'm supposed to be.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:25.394
SAM: Didn't we promise to do something for you,
like give you our blood or something?

01:25:25.394 --> 01:25:25.972
LAURA: What?

01:25:25.972 --> 01:25:30.476
SAM: We never really discussed the finer points. I
assumed that you were a vampire and that you were

01:25:30.476 --> 01:25:31.870
going to suck our blood.

01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:35.692
MARISHA: He makes dead people tea. It's very nice
tea.

01:25:35.692 --> 01:25:36.826
TRAVIS: He makes what?

01:25:36.826 --> 01:25:40.951
SAM: He makes tea out of things that grow on
corpses.

01:25:40.951 --> 01:25:42.624
MARISHA: Cemetery tea.

01:25:42.624 --> 01:25:47.951
MATT: Interesting point, too. Some of the corpses
you passed by in the middle of the arena were

01:25:47.951 --> 01:25:50.949
starting to be overgrown with fungus. It's quite
disgusting.

01:25:50.949 --> 01:25:55.662
TRAVIS: You make dead people into tea.

01:25:55.662 --> 01:26:01.621
TALIESIN: I mean, they're going to do it
eventually anyway. I just usher the process along

01:26:01.621 --> 01:26:02.538
a little bit.

01:26:02.538 --> 01:26:03.412
LAURA: Is it good tea?

01:26:03.412 --> 01:26:04.266
TALIESIN: It's very good tea.

01:26:04.266 --> 01:26:05.092
SAM: It's pretty good.

01:26:05.092 --> 01:26:10.124
TALIESIN: To be fair I think we've had two rounds
of it at this point. I've been making breakfast.

01:26:10.124 --> 01:26:14.236
MARISHA: Honestly, you could make a lot of money
setting up a shop somewhere and selling tea.

01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:14.942
TALIESIN: Huh.

01:26:14.942 --> 01:26:19.044
LAURA: Don't tell them it's dead people tea, and
then wait until they drink it and then go, "Guess

01:26:19.044 --> 01:26:20.784
"what that was made from!"

01:26:20.784 --> 01:26:25.531
TALIESIN: I mean, all tea is really dead people
tea when you think about it, so.

01:26:25.531 --> 01:26:33.024
LIAM: Are we going to go to Ophelia first and then
to Mollymauk, or?

01:26:33.024 --> 01:26:36.941
MARISHA: Ophelia first, then Mollymauk. It's all
along the way.

01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:37.903
SAM: Sounds good.

01:26:37.903 --> 01:26:42.151
TRAVIS: Should we wait for Yasha to wake up, or do
we bring her with?

01:26:42.151 --> 01:26:42.898
SAM: Oh, shoot.

01:26:42.898 --> 01:26:45.172
TRAVIS: She's got a day and a spell.

01:26:45.172 --> 01:26:51.426
MARISHA: There's some carts around back. Two, to
be exact. Some horses that'll make up for Waterloo

01:26:51.426 --> 01:26:59.170
and-- or Water Closet and Loo and Toilet. Oh yeah
by the way, we also lost like three horses.

01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:00.312
They're all dead, too.

01:27:00.312 --> 01:27:01.253
SAM: All the horses are gone.

01:27:01.253 --> 01:27:02.126
TRAVIS: Yeah, I figured.

01:27:02.126 --> 01:27:03.319
LAURA: No, W.C.?

01:27:03.319 --> 01:27:04.853
MARISHA: W.C.'s gone.

01:27:04.853 --> 01:27:06.080
SAM: Crapper, John.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.145
LIAM: He's in the fields.

01:27:07.145 --> 01:27:08.827
LAURA: This is the worst.

01:27:08.827 --> 01:27:13.082
TRAVIS: Kind of already was, but yeah.

01:27:13.082 --> 01:27:19.238
SAM: But we have a new lease on life. We have new
horses, we have a new day. Let's go name some

01:27:19.238 --> 01:27:20.726
horses and steal them!

01:27:20.726 --> 01:27:22.174
MARISHA: Sounds good.

01:27:22.174 --> 01:27:22.879
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

01:27:22.879 --> 01:27:24.829
MATT: All right.

01:27:24.829 --> 01:27:28.670
MARISHA: We steal horses. We make a nice little
bed for Yasha and lay her down.

01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:30.031
LAURA: We carry her out to the cart.

01:27:30.031 --> 01:27:31.106
TRAVIS: I put her in the Bag of Holding and--

01:27:31.106 --> 01:27:34.212
(laughter)

01:27:34.212 --> 01:27:36.612
SAM: Are there invisible cages on the carts?

01:27:36.612 --> 01:27:42.190
MATT: If you go ahead and check, the carts still
appear to be saddled up with the cages. When you

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:49.743
approach, it looks to be small bundles of produce
and various packs, but upon reaching the edge and

01:27:49.743 --> 01:27:56.764
peering in, your face immediately goes past the
illusion and you see the tarp, a heavy tarp that's

01:27:56.764 --> 01:28:00.700
laid over the cages. Pulling it open, the cages
are still there in the cart, yes.

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:06.140
SAM: The cages are invisible, or whatever's in the
tarp is invisible?

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:13.195
MATT: Best you can tell, whatever's under the tarp
is invisible. Everything in the cart.

01:28:13.195 --> 01:28:18.671
MARISHA: Can we break down the cages easily, or
bring the cages off the cart?

01:28:18.981 --> 01:28:25.862
MATT: They're pretty large cages. They're 6-foot
by 4-foot by 4-foot. They're stacked up two at a time.

01:28:25.862 --> 01:28:27.763
MARISHA: Can we get rid of them, though?

01:28:27.763 --> 01:28:32.671
MATT: You can, yeah. You pull off the cages and
pull off the tarp, and they all come out of the

01:28:32.671 --> 01:28:34.797
illusion, and they're normal.

01:28:34.797 --> 01:28:39.237
LAURA: Can we put the tarp back up and get under
the tarp and see if we can see each other?

01:28:39.237 --> 01:28:40.988
MATT: You get under the tarp, and you're under a
tarp.

01:28:40.988 --> 01:28:43.895
SAM: If I stay outside and look in?

01:28:43.895 --> 01:28:45.814
TRAVIS: It's not the tarp that's the source of the
illusion.

01:28:45.814 --> 01:28:48.215
MATT: You see all your friends getting under a
tarp.

01:28:48.215 --> 01:28:52.526
MARISHA: I put my hand through the cage bar. Do I
see anything?

01:28:52.526 --> 01:28:53.125
MATT: Nope.

01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:53.901
MARISHA: Fuck!

01:28:53.901 --> 01:28:57.523
SAM: Wait, what's invisible now?

01:28:57.523 --> 01:29:00.182
MATT: Wait, you guys pulled the cages and the tarp
off the cart.

01:29:00.182 --> 01:29:00.852
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:00.852 --> 01:29:07.506
MATT: Currently, nothing seems to be changed. The
cart still looks like it's filled with some small bundles--

01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:08.710
LAURA: I get up on the cart.

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:09.522
TALIESIN: The cart's magic.

01:29:09.522 --> 01:29:14.909
MATT: The cart is where the illusion is focused.
As Jester steps into the cart, she vanishes.

01:29:14.909 --> 01:29:15.489
LAURA: Hey!

01:29:15.489 --> 01:29:18.003
SAM: We have an invisible cart! How long will this
last?

01:29:18.003 --> 01:29:20.285
LAURA: (singing) Can you see me right now?

01:29:20.285 --> 01:29:24.503
LIAM: Just give me ten goddamn minutes. Identify
the cart.

01:29:24.503 --> 01:29:25.323
MATT: Okay.

01:29:25.323 --> 01:29:27.342
LIAM: How does it work?

01:29:27.342 --> 01:29:37.419
MATT: What it is, is it's a localized illusion to
give a fake interior appearance of a cart, but

01:29:37.419 --> 01:29:41.017
that enchantment has been made permanent through
some other magical means.

01:29:41.017 --> 01:29:41.653
SAM: Cool.

01:29:41.653 --> 01:29:42.973
MARISHA: Sick.

01:29:42.973 --> 01:29:43.903
TRAVIS: We'll take it.

01:29:43.903 --> 01:29:45.110
SAM: Stealth cart!

01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:49.577
TRAVIS: Between the stealth cart and the dome,
we're going to be rolling dirty.

01:29:49.577 --> 01:29:55.757
LIAM: Also, how long was the ride from Shady Creek
to this compound? Like three or four hours?

01:29:55.757 --> 01:30:02.445
MATT: From Shady Creek? It's only about an hour or
so. From Ophelia's, it's about an hour and a half

01:30:02.783 --> 01:30:09.014
by foot. By cart, you're not too sure. These woods
can be thick and hard to get through in large carts.

01:30:09.014 --> 01:30:11.050
LIAM: Oh, so slower by cart because--

01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:16.316
MATT: Slower by cart because you're having to
ferry it through some more difficult terrain.

01:30:16.316 --> 01:30:18.235
LIAM: Ja. But worth it.

01:30:18.235 --> 01:30:23.385
TALIESIN: Grab some stuff from the kitchen, some
blankets from upstairs, some pillows so you can

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:27.254
actually be comfortable in the cart. Yeah. Be
nice.

01:30:27.254 --> 01:30:33.581
MATT: All right. You grab two of the horses that
are still set up on the exterior, you get them

01:30:33.581 --> 01:30:37.781
forded to the cart. You guys throw your cushions
and blankets into the back. Who's going to be

01:30:37.781 --> 01:30:45.332
guiding the cart? There is still the front where
the actual seat is where you can hold the reins

01:30:45.332 --> 01:30:46.887
and steer it where it goes.

01:30:46.887 --> 01:30:47.831
LIAM: I'll sit up front.

01:30:47.831 --> 01:30:48.545
TALIESIN: I'll join.

01:30:48.545 --> 01:30:50.797
MATT: All right, so Caduceus and Caleb up front,
the rest in the back?

01:30:50.797 --> 01:30:52.547
MARISHA: I'll take one of the other horses.

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:56.114
SAM: We're going to take four horses.

01:30:56.114 --> 01:31:00.009
LAURA: Oh, so nobody's in the cart. Except for
Yasha.

01:31:00.009 --> 01:31:01.804
SAM: We need horses to pull the cart, right?

01:31:01.804 --> 01:31:04.192
LAURA: That is important, yes.

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:09.022
MATT: Two horses on the cart, two horses that are
free, ridden by--

01:31:09.022 --> 01:31:10.983
TRAVIS: Caduceus and Caleb.

01:31:10.983 --> 01:31:12.542
LIAM: We're on the cart.

01:31:12.542 --> 01:31:14.399
TRAVIS: That's right. I'll ride a horse.

01:31:14.399 --> 01:31:15.762
MARISHA: I'll ride a horse.

01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:22.140
MATT: All right. That puts Jester and Nott in the
cart with Yasha. With that, you pull the cart free

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:28.770
from where it has sunken into some of the
cold mud that seems to have closed around the

01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:36.179
wheels as the frozen temperatures of the snowfall
caused it to harden. Eventually it pulls itself

01:31:36.425 --> 01:31:40.506
out of that section on the side of the Sour Nest
and begins trekking, cutting its way, leaving

01:31:40.506 --> 01:31:46.245
little tracks in the snow along with the hoof
prints. With that, Beauregard, you jump off and

01:31:46.245 --> 01:31:53.416
quickly push the gates outside from the courtyard
out into the Savalierwood. With that, you begin to

01:31:53.416 --> 01:32:01.397
trek back towards Shady Creek Run, in the mid
afternoon of this now somewhat cold, snowfallen

01:32:01.397 --> 01:32:05.897
portion of the day. And that's where we'll go
ahead and take a break. Picking up with you guys

01:32:05.897 --> 01:32:12.869
approaching the fantastic Estate Sybaritic. Before
we get to there, we're going to go ahead and do

01:32:12.869 --> 01:32:17.800
our giveaway. Today we have this awesome white oak
tabletop dice tray from our friends at Wyrmwood.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:24.067
It's nice, smells good. It's got a leather interior.
It's kind of awesome. We need you guys to jump

01:32:24.067 --> 01:32:30.020
over to the Twitch chat on Critical Role, that's
twitch.tv/criticalrole, during the break and

01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:33.315
enter, only once, the keyword tonight, which is
"reunion."

01:32:33.315 --> 01:32:34.462
TRAVIS: Reunion.

01:32:34.462 --> 01:32:35.445
SAM: Aw.

01:32:35.445 --> 01:32:38.509
MATT: Yes. Enter it once, more than once and
you'll be disqualified. Once again, because of

01:32:38.509 --> 01:32:43.483
weird giveaway laws, only residents in the United
States and Canada excluding Quebec are able to

01:32:43.483 --> 01:32:47.239
enter. Go ahead and jump over to the Critical Role
Twitch chat, enter your code, and we'll see you

01:32:47.239 --> 01:32:49.606
back here in a little bit. All right, guys.

01:32:52.517 --> 01:32:54.815
MATT: And--

01:32:54.815 --> 01:32:56.332
TALIESIN: Wow!

01:32:56.332 --> 01:32:59.314
MARISHA: That was good! Snaps for that one!

01:32:59.314 --> 01:33:01.507
LIAM: No snaps for that one!

01:33:01.507 --> 01:33:02.597
TRAVIS: That was almost forensic.

01:33:02.597 --> 01:33:04.914
TALIESIN: I've never felt anything like that
before.

01:33:04.914 --> 01:33:11.130
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Laura will be back
when she finishes feeding the baby.

01:33:11.130 --> 01:33:13.984
LIAM: I feel like Lorenzo had his way with me just
now.

01:33:13.984 --> 01:33:21.728
MATT: However, we do have our winner of the
giveaway at the break. It is LandonFoster1. Congratulations.

01:33:22.058 --> 01:33:22.739
LIAM: Nice try, Foster.

01:33:22.739 --> 01:33:27.559
MATT: I know, he's trying to win his own
giveaways. Damn it! We'll have that sent to you

01:33:27.559 --> 01:33:31.958
ASAP. We'll contact you and get your information
and congrats for your new Wyrmwood dice box coming

01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:37.598
your way. All righty. Y'all--

01:33:37.598 --> 01:33:41.738
SAM and MARISHA: Happy Birthday Ashley!

01:33:41.738 --> 01:33:45.461
MATT: Yes! For those who didn't know, it is Ashley
Johnson's birthday.

01:33:45.461 --> 01:33:45.963
TRAVIS: Today!

01:33:45.963 --> 01:33:48.395
MARISHA: You could have said it, too!

01:33:48.395 --> 01:33:57.335
LIAM: The reason we're not overflowing with "Happy
Birthday" joy and radiance is because we also have

01:33:57.335 --> 01:34:01.655
a cold, dead, fury that she's not at the table.

01:34:01.655 --> 01:34:08.070
MATT: Yeah, we wanted her here badly, but her
shoot schedule did not allow it. We wish her happy

01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:12.590
birthday on social media and such. She is amazing
and we love her, and we want her back ASAP.

01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:13.465
LIAM: Come back.

01:34:13.465 --> 01:34:14.043
MATT: Yes.

01:34:14.043 --> 01:34:15.511
MARISHA: (singing) Ashley, come back!

01:34:15.511 --> 01:34:25.234
MATT: You all begin to make your way through this
section of the Savalierwood, following the best

01:34:25.456 --> 01:34:31.127
pathways you can for the next hour, hour and a
half before you begin to break into the North

01:34:31.127 --> 01:34:38.371
Clover area of the city. Trying to maneuver
around carefully so as to not be conspicuous.

01:34:38.371 --> 01:34:47.282
Thankfully, the enchantment on the cart enables
you to do so without much issue. However, it is

01:34:47.282 --> 01:34:55.115
also a very populated area with friends and
enemies of the house you are traveling to. Who

01:34:55.115 --> 01:34:59.519
wants to be responsible for trying to remain
inconspicuous?

01:34:59.519 --> 01:35:04.542
LIAM: Remain inconspicuous, you mean in the open,
not hidden by the illusion of the cart?

01:35:04.542 --> 01:35:08.678
MATT: Yes, well, you still have four of you who
are out in the open. Two on horseback, and two

01:35:08.678 --> 01:35:10.417
actually bringing the cart forward.

01:35:10.417 --> 01:35:17.580
MARISHA: Weird question. The carts aren't sprayed
on the side with "Iron Shepherds?"

01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:19.676
TRAVIS: There's no branding we have to worry
about?

01:35:19.676 --> 01:35:24.611
TALIESIN: White Stallions! There's a Death Star
painted on the side.

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:28.023
MARISHA: Okay, cool.

01:35:28.023 --> 01:35:30.602
LIAM: Just a Jesus fish.

01:35:30.602 --> 01:35:38.594
MARISHA: I'll flip my coat inside out to my brown
side and put up the hood.

01:35:38.594 --> 01:35:39.212
MATT: Perfect.

01:35:39.212 --> 01:35:41.975
LIAM: I look like a peasant, I'll stay put.

01:35:41.975 --> 01:35:54.257
TALIESIN: I'll switch to something inconspicuous.
I'll join the somewhat inconspicuous-looking

01:35:54.257 --> 01:35:58.597
humans attempting to create a uniform similar to
Beau's.

01:35:58.597 --> 01:35:59.141
MATT: Okay.

01:35:59.141 --> 01:36:01.165
TRAVIS: Oh shit! You can do that too, huh?

01:36:01.165 --> 01:36:01.671
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:36:01.671 --> 01:36:02.609
SAM: Are you going to do that?

01:36:02.609 --> 01:36:06.330
TRAVIS: Well, I don't want to be the only one.
I'll make myself a disheveled brunet-looking guy

01:36:06.516 --> 01:36:08.285
with a sick-ass goatee.

01:36:08.285 --> 01:36:09.543
MATT: All righty.

01:36:09.543 --> 01:36:12.374
SAM: Me and Jester will be in the invisibility
cone.

01:36:12.374 --> 01:36:16.332
MARISHA: I take everything I just said back.

01:36:16.332 --> 01:36:24.289
SAM: We're going to do each other's hair, and make
faces at everyone else in the group.

01:36:24.289 --> 01:36:26.443
TRAVIS: Birds galore.

01:36:26.443 --> 01:36:36.267
MATT: This part in the afternoon, it's bustling
enough towards the central main Clover Street.

01:36:36.267 --> 01:36:43.748
With your preparation, it doesn't seem that you
catch too much attention, thankfully. You do

01:36:43.748 --> 01:36:50.822
eventually make your way to the outskirts of the
two-story Estate Sybaritic where you see the

01:36:50.822 --> 01:37:02.020
familiar dark red wood and the fence with six-inch
spear tips still aggressively daring anybody to

01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:08.160
vault over or make entry. The guards that you had
previously encountered when you first arrived

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:11.709
immediately turn, and you see the two on the
inside of the courtyard, and the one that's

01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:16.478
outside of the gate as another one appears to be
stepping into his position he had left for a

01:37:16.478 --> 01:37:22.377
moment. All look over as you begin to approach,
get their crossbows ready. One of the guards at

01:37:22.377 --> 01:37:25.844
the very front, the one that's on the outside of
the wall already, begins to approach with his hand

01:37:25.844 --> 01:37:30.856
on the side of a sheathed blade. "Who goes there?"

01:37:30.856 --> 01:37:32.045
TRAVIS: What are we doing?

01:37:32.045 --> 01:37:41.836
LIAM: Good evening. Good day. Good afternoon. We
are expected by Miss Mardun.

01:37:42.446 --> 01:37:50.652
MATT: "Please wait here, I'll be right back. I'm
going to go check." He closes the gate behind him,

01:37:50.652 --> 01:37:55.137
locks it, leaves you there, and the two other
guards keep their crossbows at the ready, but not

01:37:55.137 --> 01:37:57.704
aimed. Just careful and ready to go.

01:37:57.704 --> 01:37:59.448
TRAVIS: We've met with her already?

01:37:59.448 --> 01:38:00.333
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:02.056
TRAVIS: How did it go?

01:38:02.056 --> 01:38:03.243
LIAM: Very well.

01:38:03.243 --> 01:38:04.769
MARISHA: She's super hot.

01:38:04.769 --> 01:38:05.736
LIAM: True.

01:38:09.496 --> 01:38:14.676
MATT: A few moments pass, and the front doors to
the estate open once more. The guard returns,

01:38:14.676 --> 01:38:21.630
approaches, unlocks the gate, opens it, "Very
well, you may enter. Bring your--" He opens the

01:38:21.630 --> 01:38:25.088
other side of the gate, but it looks like it's not
quite wide enough to get the full cart into it.

01:38:25.088 --> 01:38:26.501
"You'll have to leave your cart here."

01:38:26.501 --> 01:38:30.948
MARISHA: No, that's not doable. Do you have a
wider gate around back or something like that?

01:38:30.948 --> 01:38:38.985
MATT: "We do not. We'll watch it, don't worry.
We'll keep an eye on it. It's not going anywhere."

01:38:39.346 --> 01:38:40.392
MARISHA: You personally?

01:38:40.392 --> 01:38:43.285
MATT: "Yes! It's my job. I'm stationed literally
right here."

01:38:43.285 --> 01:38:47.365
TRAVIS: I hope you have some extra hands. We're
going to be picking up very heavy equipment and

01:38:47.365 --> 01:38:52.420
lugging it all the way from the house back to the
gate if we can't bring the cart in. I don't mind,

01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:53.071
it's just--

01:38:53.071 --> 01:38:55.202
MATT: "All right, we can muster a few additional
hands."

01:38:55.202 --> 01:38:56.700
TRAVIS: (coughs)

01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:00.949
MATT: "I'll go ahead and put in the request."

01:39:00.949 --> 01:39:06.706
LIAM: I know this cart like the back of my hand,
and if one inch of it is touched, I will know.

01:39:07.714 --> 01:39:08.685
MATT: "Do not worry."

01:39:08.685 --> 01:39:18.605
TRAVIS: I would tell this cart that we'll be right
back. Stay put, cart.

01:39:18.605 --> 01:39:20.442
SAM: (cooing)

01:39:20.442 --> 01:39:22.104
MARISHA: He's very personal with the cart.

01:39:22.104 --> 01:39:36.770
MATT: He gives an awkward stare, "Very well. The
mistress is waiting for you." He steps inside. The

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:44.398
guards flank behind as the rest of you-- Nott,
Yasha, and Jester are staying within the cart. The

01:39:44.398 --> 01:39:48.859
rest of you make your way through the courtyard
into the main chamber, into the familiar interior.

01:39:48.859 --> 01:39:53.820
Noticing this for the first time, this beautiful
estate looks like it was built from imported wood,

01:39:53.820 --> 01:40:02.665
a dark, red-brown, maroon wood color. You can see
elements of gold leafing in some of the designs

01:40:02.665 --> 01:40:07.335
have been carved at the edges where different
large wall areas come together, and there's a

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:13.945
slight pillar that separates it from panel to
panel. The closer you get to it, you also see that

01:40:13.945 --> 01:40:17.967
they've been weathered over time. Some of the wood
is starting to warp a bit, and upon closer

01:40:17.967 --> 01:40:23.774
inspection, upkeep is better seen at a distance.
You enter the interior of the warm foyer, you can

01:40:23.774 --> 01:40:29.560
see the staircase that ascends upward. You can see
the portraits of figures that seem to be members

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:36.147
of this same family. It is both beautiful and
imposing to enter this chamber. The energy here

01:40:36.147 --> 01:40:39.463
seems very tense. While you've only seen a handful
of guards, you feel like there are more eyes on

01:40:39.463 --> 01:40:49.008
you than meets the eye. A moment later, stepping
down the staircase, you hear the footsteps of

01:40:49.008 --> 01:41:00.170
Ophelia Mardun. You see a voluptuous tiefling
woman with dark, ash-gray skin, vibrant yellow

01:41:00.170 --> 01:41:07.910
eyes, pupil-less; sharpened fangs that curl down
from the top of her teeth, slicked back long black

01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:15.405
hair that seems to almost meet the back of her
ankles. Her horns curve backward and go straight

01:41:15.405 --> 01:41:20.883
up towards the rear of her head. Her coat, this
time not of the same colonial garb you had seen

01:41:20.883 --> 01:41:26.982
before, but appears to be wearing a long, deep
maroon robe that drags down the steps behind her.

01:41:26.982 --> 01:41:34.468
It's tight across in the front. She's in more of a
leisurely appearance, but she descends, one hand

01:41:34.468 --> 01:41:40.383
on the front of the robe, the other slightly
gliding down the banister, looking over this

01:41:40.383 --> 01:41:45.312
strange bunch that have entered. Recognizing you
two, not recognizing you two, and says so as she

01:41:45.312 --> 01:41:51.807
begins to descend down the final bit of the
staircase. "I see some familiar faces, but,

01:41:51.807 --> 01:41:57.427
"strangely, some I do not. Who are your friends
before I come any closer?"

01:41:57.427 --> 01:42:03.008
LIAM: Well, as I said on our previous meeting, we
have vetted appropriate people for the task at

01:42:03.316 --> 01:42:06.963
hand, which has been completed. That is all you
need to know.

01:42:06.963 --> 01:42:13.046
MATT: "Completed, you say? Are you to tell me that
these Iron Shepherds have been dealt with?"

01:42:13.046 --> 01:42:20.392
LIAM: Everyone other than the common folk that
they had taken away have been put to the blade or

01:42:20.392 --> 01:42:22.357
burnt to cinders.

01:42:22.357 --> 01:42:25.281
MATT: "And what proof have you brought me?"

01:42:25.281 --> 01:42:31.202
TRAVIS: I open up the Bag of Holding and pull out
Lorenzo's glaive.

01:42:34.611 --> 01:42:40.096
MATT: "Fetch it for me." One of the guards comes
over and puts his hands on the glaive and waits

01:42:40.096 --> 01:42:50.670
for you to release it. He walks over and hands it
to Ophelia. She grasps it and (grunts). It's got

01:42:50.670 --> 01:43:05.444
some heft to it. She takes it and looks it over,
"Very well. You are absolutely certain there are

01:43:05.444 --> 01:43:10.346
"no signs left behind to trace it? No one saw you?
No one followed you?"

01:43:10.346 --> 01:43:12.720
LIAM: You know the one who wields that weapon?

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:17.436
MATT: "I know of the one that did, yes."

01:43:17.436 --> 01:43:29.746
LIAM: This one broke his jaw almost off of his
face, and then his skull was burned to ash. We

01:43:30.001 --> 01:43:36.834
murdered everyone in that house who was not a
farmer. It is empty.

01:43:36.834 --> 01:43:43.593
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage. She
wants to believe you, but is--

01:43:47.033 --> 01:43:48.456
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:43:51.836 --> 01:44:00.845
MATT: Her yellow eyes darken into slits as she
inspects you. For that brief, pregnant pause in

01:44:00.845 --> 01:44:07.454
conversation, you feel this probing stare. You
cannot see where the pupils glance, but you feel

01:44:07.454 --> 01:44:13.531
like you are being looked up and down, and then
every aspect of your facial expressions and

01:44:13.531 --> 01:44:22.904
mannerisms being instantaneously processed. She
leans back comfortably in her stance, now

01:44:22.904 --> 01:44:28.806
previously with an intense force of
confrontational energy, she now seems to relax,

01:44:28.806 --> 01:44:34.951
takes the glaive and hands it off to one of her
guards and says, "Please prepare that for mounting

01:44:34.951 --> 01:44:36.410
"within my collection."

01:44:38.650 --> 01:44:50.520
MARISHA: Um. If you don't mind, it would actually
be greatly appreciated to us if we kept that for

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:54.571
the fallen member of our party.

01:44:54.571 --> 01:45:01.943
MATT: "Right. Very well. Leave it with them
please." The guard that was taking it off turns

01:45:01.943 --> 01:45:04.390
around and brings it back and hands it to you.

01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:05.430
MARISHA: That's very kind of you.

01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:20.272
MATT: "Consider it a favor. Remember it, please.
Very well. I am indeed impressed and intrigued.

01:45:21.711 --> 01:45:26.620
"Zemas!" she shouts off, down one of the hallways,
and you see a servant rush around the corner,

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:36.681
"Yes?" "Prepare two carriages and a package for
entry to the Empire. We shall be gone for a couple

01:45:36.681 --> 01:45:45.128
"of weeks to secure business with a contact of
mine. Notify Anselm of my absence, please. We

01:45:45.128 --> 01:45:55.691
"leave at dusk." "Of course, my lady," and he
rushes off. "Are you ready to leave at dusk?"

01:45:55.691 --> 01:46:00.018
MARISHA: You want us to go with you?

01:46:00.018 --> 01:46:04.631
MATT: "I was under the impression, based on my
contacts with The Gentleman, that we were to

01:46:04.631 --> 01:46:05.570
"return together."

01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:07.678
MARISHA: That's right, we were supposed to escort
her back. Yep.

01:46:07.678 --> 01:46:10.296
LIAM: We are amenable.

01:46:10.296 --> 01:46:11.875
MATT: "Very well."

01:46:11.875 --> 01:46:17.027
LIAM: That is just fine. There are more of us
waiting a ways away.

01:46:17.027 --> 01:46:23.523
MATT: "How many? I've only called two carriages:
one for myself and one for you. Do you require more?"

01:46:23.901 --> 01:46:25.881
LIAM: We have three more, drei.

01:46:25.881 --> 01:46:31.224
MATT: "So a third carriage? It becomes a bit
conspicuous in travel."

01:46:31.224 --> 01:46:36.726
LIAM: Well, we have come with our own means of
transportation. We can travel with you.

01:46:36.726 --> 01:46:48.914
MATT: "Very well. Two carriages, same as said
before. I will prepare, collect my things. I

01:46:48.914 --> 01:47:02.201
"suggest you do the same. We leave soon. I am
excited to travel alongside you." She smiles,

01:47:02.201 --> 01:47:04.163
turns, and begins to ascend the steps.

01:47:04.163 --> 01:47:06.915
TRAVIS: What in the hot fuck is going on with
her?

01:47:06.915 --> 01:47:13.425
MARISHA: I think hot fuck is actually very
appropriate on a few levels.

01:47:13.425 --> 01:47:16.531
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:18.591
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:47:18.591 --> 01:47:23.704
LIAM: (clears throat) You could keep some of those
puns in your head, you know.

01:47:23.704 --> 01:47:30.542
MARISHA: Why does she want to leave? This can't be
good, right?

01:47:30.542 --> 01:47:36.585
TRAVIS: We were supposed to escort her back. I'm
sure she has more business with The Gentleman, no?

01:47:36.585 --> 01:47:43.995
LIAM: Well, the job is the job. We will be
watching our own backs regardless, but the job is

01:47:43.995 --> 01:47:44.666
the job.

01:47:44.666 --> 01:47:47.113
TRAVIS: We were going to stop on the way back,
though, weren't we?

01:47:47.113 --> 01:47:51.175
LIAM: That's not too much to ask.

01:47:51.175 --> 01:47:52.167
TRAVIS: No, it's not.

01:47:52.167 --> 01:47:55.820
MARISHA: It's along the way.

01:47:55.820 --> 01:48:03.985
TALIESIN: This is the job. This is what brought
you up here? Interesting.

01:48:03.985 --> 01:48:09.101
MARISHA: It's not that this was really the job, it
was more like there were two jobs. You had to

01:48:09.101 --> 01:48:19.492
accept both as opposed to one or the other, and
the one was doable and we did it, and the other one--

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:22.385
TRAVIS: Bit off more than we could chew by us
saying yes to both.

01:48:22.385 --> 01:48:26.246
LIAM: Boy, I wonder how long before Ophelia's
ready to go.

01:48:26.246 --> 01:48:28.039
MARISHA: Well, she said the morning.

01:48:28.039 --> 01:48:29.535
TRAVIS: Dusk.

01:48:29.535 --> 01:48:35.134
MATT: Which, right now, based on how early in the
afternoon it is, gives you roughly about two and a

01:48:35.134 --> 01:48:37.025
half, three hours before dusk hits.

01:48:37.025 --> 01:48:43.348
TRAVIS: Maybe we'll wait for her outside the
gates? With our cart.

01:48:43.348 --> 01:48:50.062
MATT: Is there anything you guys wish to do or
prepare while you're waiting for her to join you

01:48:50.062 --> 01:48:51.502
outside of the estate?

01:48:51.502 --> 01:48:53.901
SAM: Us?

01:48:53.901 --> 01:48:55.263
MATT: Anybody.

01:48:55.263 --> 01:48:57.661
LIAM: This is the sticks, right?

01:48:57.661 --> 01:49:06.841
MATT: Comparably. This is the northern side of the
Clover Plaza, a little bit to the northwest.

01:49:06.841 --> 01:49:17.340
Imagine this is like the sparse, gated community
of the lawless city. The northern side of the

01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:22.418
street is where most of the houses live, the
various feuding factions. It's where the money

01:49:22.418 --> 01:49:30.378
goes. Right around the road, especially south of
it and east of it, is where you start getting into

01:49:30.378 --> 01:49:35.374
the slums and the folks that exist here because
they have no other choice.

01:49:35.374 --> 01:49:42.260
TRAVIS: The guards, or the people that she has
working for her, are they wearing any sort of face

01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:44.410
protection, head protection, or is it open?

01:49:44.410 --> 01:49:52.497
MATT: The guards that are inside the house are not
wearing face protection. They're wearing hide

01:49:52.497 --> 01:50:01.902
armor comprised of multiple thick strips of cured
hide dyed to a dark maroon color. There is

01:50:01.902 --> 01:50:07.143
definitely a color scheme going on here in the
interior and Ophelia's preferred means of wear.

01:50:07.143 --> 01:50:16.373
The ones outside do have a very simple leather cap
with heavy straps, like a Roman-type style, that

01:50:16.373 --> 01:50:19.921
descend past the sides of the chin, but that's
about it.

01:50:19.921 --> 01:50:28.836
TRAVIS: Can I ask, in your previous engagements
with her, how far are we trusting her?

01:50:28.836 --> 01:50:31.843
LIAM and MARISHA: Eh.

01:50:31.843 --> 01:50:33.504
TRAVIS: No, superficial, yeah?

01:50:33.504 --> 01:50:36.484
MARISHA: Not at all, yeah.

01:50:36.484 --> 01:50:40.695
LIAM: I think that everyone in this town is
dangerous, so eyes wide open.

01:50:40.695 --> 01:50:45.403
MARISHA: Yeah, you guys probably didn't see a lot,
considering you were in cages when you came

01:50:45.403 --> 01:50:50.318
through, but this is a shitty shit-hole. Like a
really shitty shit-hole.

01:50:50.318 --> 01:50:51.658
TALIESIN: I do live here.

01:50:55.958 --> 01:51:05.453
MARISHA: You live in a very nice garden an hour
north of here. The city is garbage.

01:51:05.453 --> 01:51:08.069
LIAM: Do you spend time in the-- no, you have been
alone--

01:51:08.069 --> 01:51:09.603
MARISHA: You haven't left in 18 years!

01:51:09.603 --> 01:51:16.707
TALIESIN: Well, I've left. I just haven't left in
a while. I've got to come to town sometimes. Get

01:51:16.707 --> 01:51:17.952
things, get supplies.

01:51:17.952 --> 01:51:21.436
LIAM: It still stands: it's pretty shitty.

01:51:21.436 --> 01:51:25.313
TRAVIS: Yeah, and good things come from shit,
right? Like flowers?

01:51:25.313 --> 01:51:30.529
TALIESIN: I'm going to have to make a little
confession. I really haven't been many other

01:51:30.529 --> 01:51:35.840
places, so I suppose I really don't actually have
a great basis of comparison.

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.253
TRAVIS: You didn't travel much?

01:51:37.253 --> 01:51:41.498
TALIESIN: No-- oh yeah, I haven't traveled much at
all.

01:51:41.498 --> 01:51:45.630
LIAM: He's been living in a cemetery--

01:51:45.630 --> 01:51:46.874
TRAVIS: Living?

01:51:46.874 --> 01:51:49.172
LIAM: Exclusively for a number of years.

01:51:49.172 --> 01:51:50.699
MARISHA: It is very beautiful.

01:51:50.699 --> 01:51:51.137
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:51:51.137 --> 01:51:53.177
LIAM: Still a cemetery, though.

01:51:53.177 --> 01:51:59.329
TRAVIS: We asked this, I'm sure. You're--
(whispering) He's alive, right?

01:51:59.329 --> 01:52:02.352
MARISHA: He is. We asked the same question.

01:52:02.352 --> 01:52:04.044
TALIESIN: Very much so.

01:52:04.044 --> 01:52:05.886
TRAVIS: (strained) Cool, yep.

01:52:05.886 --> 01:52:13.502
MARISHA: Yeah, the smell comes with it. It's got a
little musk? Yeah.

01:52:13.502 --> 01:52:15.184
TRAVIS: Musty as shit? Yeah, okay.

01:52:15.184 --> 01:52:17.609
LIAM: It's strong at first, but--

01:52:17.609 --> 01:52:18.990
TRAVIS: Like sandalwood, kind of?

01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:23.726
LIAM: Yes, but you get used to it and it mellows
the longer you're around him.

01:52:23.726 --> 01:52:28.915
MARISHA: When you two mix together, it has this
meatloaf smell.

01:52:29.229 --> 01:52:34.016
LIAM: It has not been that long since I took a
shower. I don't know why this running gag is continuing.

01:52:34.016 --> 01:52:39.398
MATT: As this is happening, you guys are talking
and spending time within the cart.

01:52:39.398 --> 01:52:45.509
LAURA: We're doing each other's hair, and I'm
using my Mending cantrip to fix up Yasha's clothes.

01:52:45.509 --> 01:52:48.340
MATT: Which is helping tremendously in the
process.

01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:50.049
SAM: But she's still lying unconscious?

01:52:50.049 --> 01:52:56.180
MATT: She's still unconscious. The enchantment
does last for a protracted period of time. You do

01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:07.870
begin to hear a few pairs of horse hooves coming
up louder, behind where the cart is currently set.

01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:09.521
LAURA: Can they see the cart?

01:53:09.521 --> 01:53:12.523
SAM: I think they can see the cart. They just
can't see us in it.

01:53:12.523 --> 01:53:14.148
LAURA: Can they hear us?

01:53:14.148 --> 01:53:18.616
MATT: You guys can see outside of it because there
is no tarp covering the space.

01:53:18.616 --> 01:53:19.863
LAURA: Do they look like they can hear us?

01:53:19.863 --> 01:53:25.119
MATT: You turn around and look. You don't know if
they can hear you or not, but you see two rather

01:53:25.119 --> 01:53:35.024
extravagant-looking carriages making their way
towards you. You can see this dark wood with gold

01:53:35.024 --> 01:53:43.740
detailing on the outsides. Each has a curtained
window on the right and the left, sets of large,

01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:48.146
spoked wheels on each side, and each one has two
horses affixed to the front. There is a driver at

01:53:48.146 --> 01:53:49.903
the front of each one.

01:53:49.903 --> 01:53:52.518
LAURA: Nott, moon them. Moon them right now.

01:53:52.518 --> 01:53:55.512
SAM: Yes. I will moon them.

01:53:55.512 --> 01:53:59.396
MATT: There is no reaction, but you are, indeed,
mooning them.

01:53:59.396 --> 01:54:02.548
LAURA: (laughs loudly) I mean, we laugh very
quietly, just in case.

01:54:02.548 --> 01:54:03.787
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:54:03.787 --> 01:54:10.259
LAURA: Oh no, I rolled really bad on my stealth
check. Eight.

01:54:10.259 --> 01:54:18.879
MATT: This one older fellow, his nose has grown
over time to the point where it's overpowering the

01:54:18.879 --> 01:54:24.541
front of his face, and he's got this rough, white
hair across his chin where he hasn't shaved in a

01:54:24.541 --> 01:54:31.353
bit, but he's dressed raggedly, though nice? If
you imagine one of the ghosts in Haunted Mansion

01:54:31.353 --> 01:54:36.685
before it died, it's how he's dressed, and as it
(horse clopping), he hears you laughing and he

01:54:36.685 --> 01:54:38.549
looks, "Hello?"

01:54:43.529 --> 01:54:46.358
TRAVIS: Yasha wakes up: (startles)

01:54:46.358 --> 01:54:57.490
MATT: He steps down from it-- (laughter). As you
guys are stepping outside, you hear this as well,

01:54:57.683 --> 01:55:04.955
and you see the two carriages brought up on the
sides of the estate. Shortly thereafter, Ophelia

01:55:04.955 --> 01:55:10.616
comes behind you, through the door, in the long
colonial coat that you had first met her in.

01:55:10.616 --> 01:55:21.525
Behind her, you see two other guards carrying a
number of packed handbags. She points, "All right,

01:55:21.525 --> 01:55:26.354
"please place them-- the front one is mine-- within
there." They start loading the bags up into the

01:55:26.354 --> 01:55:31.230
carriage, up on top of it. One of the guys are
lifting the other up and they are passing the bags

01:55:31.230 --> 01:55:35.209
along as he's putting it up and they're strapping
it down with rope across the top of it for travel

01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:43.716
until, eventually, she is escorted outside of the
grounds. She looks to you all outside of the

01:55:43.716 --> 01:55:52.173
cart-- those that she can see, and she goes,
"Should anyone ask along our journeys, I am Lady

01:55:52.474 --> 01:56:08.155
"Quinn Denzala of Nogvurot going to see my ailing
mother in Deastok. You are my personal guard. If

01:56:08.155 --> 01:56:16.063
"you mess that up-- well, you may have more blood
on your hands, so it would behoove you to pay

01:56:16.063 --> 01:56:18.942
"attention. Hmm?"

01:56:18.942 --> 01:56:21.021
TRAVIS: Of course.

01:56:21.021 --> 01:56:22.727
LIAM: Of course, Quinn.

01:56:22.727 --> 01:56:31.597
MATT: "Very good. Now, let us be off in comfort."
She steps up into the carriage and one of the

01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:36.175
guards helps her. She closes the door behind her.
The other carriage doors open and are left open

01:56:36.175 --> 01:56:37.738
for whoever would like to travel along with them.

01:56:37.738 --> 01:56:40.161
SAM: Are you guys going to go with her?

01:56:40.161 --> 01:56:45.042
LIAM: We need our cart to be driven--

01:56:45.042 --> 01:56:46.286
TALIESIN: I can drive that.

01:56:46.286 --> 01:56:47.136
LAURA: Yeah!

01:56:47.136 --> 01:56:51.035
LIAM: In the two carriages?

01:56:51.035 --> 01:56:54.583
MATT: There's one carriage that's her's, and
another carriage--

01:56:54.583 --> 01:56:55.372
LIAM: Just hers?

01:56:55.372 --> 01:56:58.252
MATT: She does not want to travel with anybody. At
least, not at the moment.

01:56:58.252 --> 01:57:02.294
LIAM: I will enter the second carriage, if they
are looking for people.

01:57:02.294 --> 01:57:04.198
MATT: All right, that's Caleb.

01:57:04.198 --> 01:57:05.315
MARISHA: How many people?

01:57:05.315 --> 01:57:06.792
MATT: Currently, just one--

01:57:06.792 --> 01:57:07.922
MARISHA: That are sitting with her?

01:57:07.922 --> 01:57:08.571
MATT: Oh, with her?

01:57:08.571 --> 01:57:09.951
MARISHA: How many that she wants to sit with
her--?

01:57:09.951 --> 01:57:11.419
SAM and LAURA: She doesn't want anyone.

01:57:11.419 --> 01:57:12.735
MATT: She has her own carriage.

01:57:12.735 --> 01:57:19.867
LIAM: I think perhaps we are the intermediaries
here. Why don't you ride with me?

01:57:19.867 --> 01:57:20.563
MARISHA: Okay.

01:57:20.563 --> 01:57:23.585
LAURA: There's still a horse that has to be
ridden.

01:57:23.585 --> 01:57:25.635
SAM: We can tie it to the other ones.

01:57:25.635 --> 01:57:26.461
LAURA: Okay.

01:57:26.461 --> 01:57:32.498
TALIESIN: I'll explain what's happening to the
horses so that they move appropriately.

01:57:32.498 --> 01:57:35.683
LAURA: You can speak to the horses?

01:57:35.683 --> 01:57:39.104
MATT: As you guys are hitching the horses to the
other horses, Ophelia leans out of a window and

01:57:39.104 --> 01:57:44.730
goes: "This is intended to be nothing but a
visitation travel, there is no reason to have

01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:50.140
"additional beasts. Do you care for your beasts?
Are they sentimental to you?"

01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:52.086
LIAM: No, not at all. Cut them loose.

01:57:52.086 --> 01:57:57.251
MATT: "Cut them loose, and whatever you lose, I
will happily repurchase for you when we arrive in Zadash."

01:57:57.336 --> 01:58:00.733
MARISHA: It's not that we don't care for these
animals, it's just that we cared for Water Closet,

01:58:00.733 --> 01:58:05.353
and Loo, and John way more.

01:58:05.353 --> 01:58:07.725
LIAM: She's missing a lot of context on that
sentence.

01:58:07.725 --> 01:58:09.014
MARISHA: I just wanted you to know.

01:58:09.014 --> 01:58:11.440
MATT: "I appreciate your clarification."

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:13.867
MARISHA: But yeah, fuck these horses.

01:58:13.867 --> 01:58:18.638
MATT: "Indeed." Closes the curtains on her
window.

01:58:18.638 --> 01:58:23.325
TALIESIN: I explain this to the horses, I let them
know what's going on; telling the two that they're

01:58:23.325 --> 01:58:24.905
ready to go about their business.

01:58:24.905 --> 01:58:26.485
SAM: Who's going to pull our carriage?

01:58:26.485 --> 01:58:32.574
MATT: You still have two horses on your cart, but
there are the two being ridden separately. Those

01:58:32.574 --> 01:58:36.478
horses begin to wander off, finding their way
through the Savalierwood southward.

01:58:36.478 --> 01:58:37.640
SAM: I named them and everything.

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:40.110
LAURA: They're just going to be eaten, though!
They're just horses.

01:58:40.110 --> 01:58:46.023
SAM: I named all of the horses while you guys were
in there! I named them Waterloo, Fernando, Mamma

01:58:46.023 --> 01:58:47.378
Mia, and Dancing Queen.

01:58:47.378 --> 01:58:51.638
(laughter)

01:58:51.638 --> 01:58:53.805
MATT: Well, say goodbye to the two of your
choosing, Nott.

01:58:53.805 --> 01:58:54.596
TRAVIS: Yeah, which ones?

01:58:54.596 --> 01:58:55.701
MARISHA: Definitely Mamma Mia--

01:58:55.701 --> 01:58:56.716
LIAM: Got to keep Mamma Mia.

01:58:56.716 --> 01:58:58.720
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and LAURA: No.

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:02.228
SAM: I guess Fernando and Waterloo.

01:59:02.228 --> 01:59:06.196
LAURA: Mamma Mia and Dancing Queen are staying
with us.

01:59:06.196 --> 01:59:13.728
MATT: There you go, okay. As they wander off, you
hear "Hyah!" (lashing, horse clopping), the

01:59:13.728 --> 01:59:17.374
carriages begin to pick up speed. Caduceus, you're
driving the cart?

01:59:17.374 --> 01:59:19.331
TALIESIN: Yeah, give them a little: If you
wouldn't mind?

01:59:19.331 --> 01:59:23.627
MATT: With that, it picks up as well, and now your
train of two carriages and your cart begin to make

01:59:23.627 --> 01:59:30.214
their way southward, through Shadycreek Run. You
guys begin to curve through the Clover Plaza,

01:59:30.214 --> 01:59:36.129
where you can see the bustle of the city is
definitely making its way towards the latter half

01:59:36.129 --> 01:59:43.870
of the day. The sunset is cresting probably in the
next hour or so. Keeping watch, the ones that are

01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:49.235
looking about would be-- Caduceus, you'd have a
good view? You guys have a view throughout the

01:59:49.235 --> 01:59:51.516
illusion, so you three--

01:59:51.516 --> 01:59:52.957
LIAM: Can I interject for a second?

01:59:52.957 --> 01:59:53.378
MATT: Sure.

01:59:53.378 --> 01:59:58.339
LIAM: Since this is a lot of time that's passing,
and it's just Beauregard and I in this carriage,

01:59:58.339 --> 02:00:04.838
can I, as a ritual spell, cast Detect Magic and
check out the cart around us?

02:00:04.838 --> 02:00:13.777
MATT: Sure. You finish focusing on the spell and
as you release your arcane incantation to sense

02:00:13.777 --> 02:00:22.320
the area around you, there's nothing about the
cart that appears magical. Since you're focusing

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:25.014
on that, and you are--

02:00:25.014 --> 02:00:26.935
TRAVIS: I guess I'm up front with Caduceus.

02:00:26.935 --> 02:00:30.316
MATT: All right, I would like you four-- or you
three, and you to go ahead and roll perception

02:00:30.316 --> 02:00:31.149
checks, please.

02:00:32.599 --> 02:00:34.269
SAM: 14. Jesus.

02:00:36.649 --> 02:00:37.648
TRAVIS: 12.

02:00:37.648 --> 02:00:39.268
TALIESIN: 24.

02:00:39.268 --> 02:00:42.868
LAURA: Aw, 21. But still good.

02:00:42.868 --> 02:00:51.013
MATT: The two of you noticing as the cloud covered
skies-- the snowfall has lightened, it's not as

02:00:51.093 --> 02:00:57.604
heavy as it was in the morning, but there is still
a faint, soft falling of snowflakes in the air.

02:00:57.604 --> 02:01:05.474
The now gray and white city with the edges of the
roads mucked with dirty snow and mud, being

02:01:05.474 --> 02:01:11.633
tracked through from all the foot and cart
traffic. You do notice off to the sides near one

02:01:11.633 --> 02:01:19.832
of the inns or taverns that you have not had the
opportunity to visit yet, within the Clover Plaza,

02:01:19.832 --> 02:01:26.636
you see a small gathering or meeting that catches
your attention. You glance over and-- you wouldn't

02:01:26.636 --> 02:01:32.656
have context. Actually, none of you have the
context for this. The two of you see a small

02:01:32.656 --> 02:01:43.163
meeting, between two really burly-looking figures
in armor. A similar style-- or at least a

02:01:43.163 --> 02:01:48.201
haphazard patchwork-style of armor and adornments
as some of the others that patrol the streets,

02:01:48.201 --> 02:01:55.526
keeping an eye out. Look like thugs a bit. You see
two of them meeting with two figures that are in

02:01:55.526 --> 02:02:03.147
heavy cloak and hood. Because of your perceptive
abilities, you notice that they are of a similar

02:02:03.147 --> 02:02:15.686
skin color as Ophelia. Their features are very
fine, and their lithe bodies vanish within the

02:02:15.686 --> 02:02:21.381
heavy cloaks that guide them. You do see bits of
armor protruding off the side of one that appear

02:02:21.381 --> 02:02:26.166
to be dark and insect-like.

02:02:26.166 --> 02:02:28.726
LAURA: Does it look like the guy that we met down
in the sewers?

02:02:28.726 --> 02:02:34.948
MATT: It does. As you're watching out you see them
discussing-- there is a brief transaction in the

02:02:34.948 --> 02:02:40.067
shadows of this alleyway and a handshake from the
two cloaked figures and these two others. As you

02:02:40.067 --> 02:02:42.088
ride by and continue southward.

02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:45.284
LAURA: Shady deals happening over there.

02:02:45.284 --> 02:02:53.176
TALIESIN: Oh, I've never seen one before. Are they
buying--

02:02:53.176 --> 02:02:57.014
LAURA: I don't know. They're probably selling
drugs to each other.

02:02:57.014 --> 02:03:01.487
TALIESIN: Oh, that's cool. That's super cool.

02:03:01.487 --> 02:03:06.556
LAURA: Wait a minute-- (gasps) Wait a minute!
Those were those guys!

02:03:06.556 --> 02:03:07.428
TALIESIN: Which guys?

02:03:07.428 --> 02:03:12.587
LAURA: The guys that were-- (gasps) Nott!

02:03:12.587 --> 02:03:13.048
SAM: What?!

02:03:13.048 --> 02:03:16.005
LAURA: I just saw one of those guys that had the
thing!

02:03:16.005 --> 02:03:18.213
TRAVIS: The dodecahedron.

02:03:18.213 --> 02:03:27.855
SAM: You saw a drow creature from Xhorhas? You saw
a crick?

02:03:27.855 --> 02:03:33.713
LAURA: Don't say that! That's really rude. I saw
them. They were over there, they had cloaks on and

02:03:33.731 --> 02:03:38.085
I saw them! What if they can sense us and they
know that we have the thing that they're looking

02:03:38.085 --> 02:03:42.531
for? I keep looking at them to see if they notice
us.

02:03:42.531 --> 02:03:47.654
MATT: You pay very close attention as you pass
through the main thoroughfare of the Clover Plaza.

02:03:47.654 --> 02:03:53.738
They don't seem to notice or pay any mind to your
presence and eventually they are out of sight, and

02:03:53.738 --> 02:03:59.131
you have no means of keeping tabs on them. As you
now head towards the southern side of the Clover

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:06.026
Street, heading towards the outskirts of
Shadycreek Run. Eventually out of the city

02:04:06.026 --> 02:04:18.998
entirely. As the buildings begin to give way to
hovels and huts, and tents, and shacks, you begin

02:04:18.998 --> 02:04:25.773
to see really where the bulk of those who have
escaped or not allowed entry into the Empire now

02:04:25.773 --> 02:04:34.068
reside. You see mud-covered folks that are bundled
up for body heat in this cold weather. Many that

02:04:34.068 --> 02:04:40.486
are outstretching hands in your direction for
handouts, and others that get too close to the

02:04:40.486 --> 02:04:49.487
outside of Ophelia's carriage. The cart-driver
grabs a switch off the side and whacks one of them

02:04:49.487 --> 02:04:54.349
on the hand and he recoils from it and darts off,
and a few others hiss and run off with him.

02:04:54.349 --> 02:05:02.948
Eventually, that gives way to the path that leads
to the Quannah Breach. Familiar for those of you

02:05:02.948 --> 02:05:10.428
who had traveled here previously, you can see the
Dunrock Mountains ahead: the large, spiky crags

02:05:10.428 --> 02:05:17.489
that make up that mark this mountain range that is
the divide between the northern Grey Wastes and

02:05:17.489 --> 02:05:23.518
the descent into the Dwendalian Empire. The
Greying Wildlands that you reside in begin to give

02:05:23.518 --> 02:05:32.281
way as you see the gate of the Uttolot family's
exit from the region. As you approach, similar

02:05:32.281 --> 02:05:39.970
figures that originally greeted you at dusk when
you had arrived here seem to be stationed there.

02:05:39.970 --> 02:05:46.546
As they approach the carriage, before they can
even raise a word, Ophelia leans one arm out the

02:05:46.546 --> 02:05:51.949
side and throws a small coin purse in their
direction. One of them catches it, opens it real

02:05:51.949 --> 02:06:00.077
fast, and gives a motion. The two gates open
before the carriage. There you get to see the

02:06:00.077 --> 02:06:07.343
familiar sharpened wooden pikes that are adorned
with skulls and pieces of whatever other warnings

02:06:07.343 --> 02:06:13.676
they could amass for anybody who attempted to pass
without paying the toll. Passing beyond those

02:06:13.676 --> 02:06:19.496
gates, you curve around the corner and now you're
between the sheared cliffs of the Quannah Breach,

02:06:19.496 --> 02:06:25.385
where it looks like this mountain was pulled
apart, leaving behind this strange, snaking maze

02:06:25.385 --> 02:06:31.416
of open pathway. Smooth on the inside of these
otherwise rough mountains, like wind has, over

02:06:31.416 --> 02:06:37.438
time, eroded and driven smooth the interior
through here. You can hear the faint winds blowing

02:06:37.438 --> 02:06:47.495
through, occasionally bursting with loud whistles
and this droning moan sound that seems to be

02:06:47.495 --> 02:06:56.436
created by the wind pushing against these weirdly
carved pathways through. These drivers have done

02:06:56.436 --> 02:07:02.224
this many times and very deftly maneuver through.
When it does fork off in different directions,

02:07:02.224 --> 02:07:09.212
they knowingly take the path that you assume will
bring you to the end of this journey. After a bit

02:07:09.212 --> 02:07:16.726
of time passing through this strange ravine, it
opens up once more to a very large gate. You can

02:07:16.726 --> 02:07:26.367
see crownsguard there, expecting you as you pass
through. The crownsguard begin to approach. The

02:07:26.367 --> 02:07:34.887
carriages stop, and Ophelia steps out. As she does
so, another one of the carriage drivers, the one

02:07:34.887 --> 02:07:45.646
that's driving your carriage, Beau and Caleb,
steps off to join her with a small scroll case.

02:07:45.646 --> 02:07:55.878
She steps up to the captain of this watch. From a
distance, they begin to have a conversation. You

02:07:55.878 --> 02:07:59.603
can't hear it. It's hushed voices, or at least not
loud enough to reach your distance.

02:07:59.603 --> 02:08:01.306
MARISHA: I wish you could still read lips.

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:03.719
LAURA: I know, that's what I was thinking: I can't
read lips!

02:08:03.719 --> 02:08:04.724
MATT: Nah, that's the old campaign.

02:08:04.724 --> 02:08:07.226
SAM: I could sneak up and--

02:08:08.084 --> 02:08:10.361
TRAVIS: Caleb, what about your cat?

02:08:10.361 --> 02:08:13.110
LIAM: Are you whispering to me through the doorway
or--

02:08:13.110 --> 02:08:17.531
TRAVIS: No, I'm leaning over the carriage like:
Hey what about your gato?

02:08:17.531 --> 02:08:19.141
LIAM: Ja (dying sound)

02:08:19.141 --> 02:08:21.561
LAURA: Hey, look what I can do.

02:08:21.561 --> 02:08:22.339
SAM: What?

02:08:22.339 --> 02:08:32.506
LAURA: I am going to use-- what is the thing? The
Cloak of Shadows? I'm going to use Cloak of

02:08:32.506 --> 02:08:33.700
Shadows on myself.

02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:36.310
MATT: All right. It gives you about 12 seconds of
invisibility.

02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:40.060
LAURA: Wait, that's it? Motherfucker, I thought it
gave me a lot more than that.

02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:41.398
MATT: It's until the end of your next turn.

02:08:41.398 --> 02:08:44.949
LAURA: Ah shit, it's in-battle. Hold on, look what
I can do!

02:08:44.949 --> 02:08:48.504
SAM: Where'd you go? Oh my god! Oh hi.

02:08:48.504 --> 02:08:55.361
MATT: Best use of Channel Divinity in D&amp;amp;D history
right there, ladies and gentlemen.

02:08:55.361 --> 02:08:57.145
LAURA: I thought it lasted longer than that.

02:08:57.145 --> 02:08:59.579
SAM: It was really cool, though.

02:08:59.579 --> 02:09:01.589
LAURA: Did you see that I went invisible?

02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:03.935
SAM: You were gone! It was crazy.

02:09:03.935 --> 02:09:05.826
LAURA: I've been thinking about that for a while.

02:09:05.826 --> 02:09:10.990
SAM: Well, next time you use it maybe it will have
a purpose.

02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:16.923
(laughter)

02:09:16.923 --> 02:09:17.559
TRAVIS: Status quo.

02:09:17.559 --> 02:09:21.575
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say: I do not miss
Sam Riegel giving me shit about my spell usage.

02:09:21.575 --> 02:09:28.422
MATT: As this is happening, and you're watching
carefully across the way, the scroll case is

02:09:28.422 --> 02:09:34.601
opened and a series of papers are handed to the
crownsguard there. Then a handful of coin are

02:09:34.601 --> 02:09:42.470
passed over by Ophelia to the captain. Reads over
the papers, hands them back, gives a hand motion

02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:51.598
to a group of about six or seven crownsguard at
the gate. They begin to open it, and entry is

02:09:51.598 --> 02:09:59.364
given to the Empire. In the few days you've been
gone, the carriages pick up speed once more and

02:09:59.364 --> 02:10:03.682
you re-enter the Dwendalian Empire, heading
towards the northern side of the Marrow Valley.

02:10:03.682 --> 02:10:04.994
Welcome back.

02:10:04.994 --> 02:10:06.439
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:10:06.439 --> 02:10:15.601
LIAM: Excuse me. Once we're past the border, and
time has passed, and the two Empire kids are

02:10:15.793 --> 02:10:28.070
sitting alone in this carriage. Caleb, staring out
the window not even looking at Beauregard: Beauregard?

02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:29.262
MARISHA: Mm-hmm?

02:10:31.992 --> 02:10:49.903
LIAM: Who are you? You know an awful lot about me
now. You are not some (sigh) youth throwing

02:10:49.903 --> 02:11:03.027
themselves on drink, as you tried to claim when we
first met. You are clearly tied to something

02:11:03.027 --> 02:11:11.415
greater than that. You are not some fuck-up. Who
are you?

02:11:11.415 --> 02:11:16.338
MARISHA: It's funny. I thought you were going to
say something like, "Man, the Empire's sure fucked

02:11:16.338 --> 02:11:20.946
up." I was going to be like: Right? I was just
thinking the same thing. It's just like what

02:11:20.946 --> 02:11:23.750
Jester said: we can read each other's thoughts.

02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:36.861
LIAM: That's a separate issue. We're very
different, but not completely. I would feel a

02:11:36.861 --> 02:11:39.589
little safer if I knew a little more about you.

02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:50.858
MARISHA: Well, you know I'm a monk of the Cobalt
Soul. I actually dumped a lot of this on Nott. She

02:11:50.858 --> 02:11:53.441
asked. We were a little tipsy.

02:11:53.441 --> 02:11:54.402
LIAM: Okay.

02:11:54.402 --> 02:11:58.215
MARISHA: I was feeling vulnerable in the moment.
It doesn't happen often. She caught me in a

02:11:58.215 --> 02:11:59.176
perfect window.

02:11:59.176 --> 02:12:00.254
LIAM: Her or you?

02:12:00.254 --> 02:12:04.877
MARISHA: Nott did. Wait-- both? Nevermind.

02:12:04.877 --> 02:12:05.810
LIAM: Right.

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:23.539
MARISHA: I never intended to be a monk of the
Cobalt Soul. My father sent me away to the

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:36.402
monastery when I wasn't what he wanted me to be.
And I was kind of a dick. So.

02:12:36.402 --> 02:12:40.994
LIAM: Why are you out here in the wastelands?

02:12:43.894 --> 02:12:55.077
MARISHA: I ran away from the Cobalt Soul and they
gave me a raise in rank because of it. That was

02:12:55.077 --> 02:13:00.936
kind of cool. Really just further instilled my
rebellion, to be totally honest.

02:13:00.936 --> 02:13:07.852
LIAM: Now you what? You want to follow the orders
of the Cobalt Soul? You want to do whatever they

02:13:07.852 --> 02:13:14.967
ask you to do? Or something you want to do? Why
are you running around with criminals? And me?

02:13:17.497 --> 02:13:24.854
MARISHA: My whole life was dictated by
establishment that I didn't have a lot of control

02:13:24.854 --> 02:13:43.809
over. The Cobalt Soul has this underlying faction
that helps uproot corrupt establishment. I know, I

02:13:43.809 --> 02:13:53.425
scoffed at the idea of being a part of a system
that's supposed to take down systems. It doesn't

02:13:53.425 --> 02:14:00.886
really make sense, but you know. Maybe you, if
anyone, can understand the idea of fighting fire

02:14:00.886 --> 02:14:10.436
with fire. That's why I'm doing this.

02:14:14.906 --> 02:14:18.630
LIAM: This is all orders you are following?

02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:39.105
MARISHA: No. They just want information. I'm out
in the world at the ground level. People like us

02:14:39.387 --> 02:14:46.875
tend to have our fingers on the pulse of what's
being said around the city sometimes. It's not

02:14:46.875 --> 02:14:53.432
necessarily something that a monk in full
accolades can always accomplish.

02:14:53.432 --> 02:15:04.336
LIAM: Okay. So a little bit of official business.
A little bit of your own personal axe to grind.

02:15:04.336 --> 02:15:04.869
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:15:04.869 --> 02:15:12.446
LIAM: (repeating) Ja. Danke.

02:15:12.446 --> 02:15:15.205
MARISHA: Does that make you uncomfortable?

02:15:15.205 --> 02:15:16.604
LIAM: No.

02:15:20.094 --> 02:15:21.361
MARISHA: Cool.

02:15:23.371 --> 02:15:24.995
LIAM: (exaggerated) Cool.

02:15:24.995 --> 02:15:26.604
MARISHA: Ew. Don't do that.

02:15:26.604 --> 02:15:32.702
(laughter)

02:15:32.702 --> 02:15:41.064
MATT: Continuing southward through the night.
Eventually, the carriages pull off to the side for

02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:42.081
the evening.

02:15:42.081 --> 02:15:43.872
LAURA: Me and Nott are having a dance party in
ours.

02:15:43.872 --> 02:15:46.270
MATT: (laughs) That no one can see.

02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:50.086
LIAM: (high pitched) I'm alive, I'm happy!

02:15:50.086 --> 02:15:58.063
MATT: Ophelia doesn't leave her carriage, but
eventually the carts and the two carriages are

02:15:58.063 --> 02:16:04.272
circled around a campfire. The drivers begin to
cook their own meal and you are allowed to use the

02:16:04.272 --> 02:16:05.583
space to make what you wish.

02:16:05.583 --> 02:16:11.108
MARISHA: Have we made it outside the city?

02:16:11.108 --> 02:16:15.349
MATT: You guys are far beyond the city, you're
beyond the Quannah Breach. You haven't reached the

02:16:15.349 --> 02:16:23.397
main road yet. You are just south of the breach,
maybe by four hours or so. You're still north,

02:16:23.397 --> 02:16:24.534
north side if you want to--

02:16:24.534 --> 02:16:29.757
MARISHA: So we're still north of the Crispvale
Thicket.

02:16:29.757 --> 02:16:35.415
MATT: Yes, far north. A few days north of that.
Like three days north.

02:16:35.415 --> 02:16:38.297
TALIESIN: I'll cook up what's there and we'll have
a meal.

02:16:38.297 --> 02:16:47.028
MATT: All right. For the purpose of expediency,
you have another day and a half, two days worth of

02:16:47.028 --> 02:16:53.722
travel. The snowfall hasn't come in flurries,
thankfully. It's just been a gentle, continuous

02:16:53.722 --> 02:17:00.346
snowfall. Chilled as it is, the blankets have come
in handy for those riding in the cart as the

02:17:00.346 --> 02:17:10.357
carriages themselves help insulate somewhat from
the temperature. There comes a point where all of

02:17:10.357 --> 02:17:27.977
you who were present: Beauregard, Caleb, Nott.
Where your hair begins to stand on your skin, and

02:17:27.977 --> 02:17:38.188
this deep, lead-like sinking sensation clenches
the bottom of your stomach. As you've, a short

02:17:38.188 --> 02:17:44.310
time ago, met up with the Glory Run Road heading
southward. You begin to come upon two

02:17:44.310 --> 02:17:51.550
familiar-looking mounds, hills that flank the
sides of the road.

02:17:54.270 --> 02:18:04.266
SAM: I will message Caleb with my little wire and
say: Do you think we should stop? You can reply to

02:18:04.266 --> 02:18:05.033
this message.

02:18:05.033 --> 02:18:14.139
LIAM: Yes. I pull out my own wire and I aim
towards Ophelia and say: Miss Denzala, we require

02:18:14.139 --> 02:18:18.852
a few moments on the side of the road here.

02:18:18.852 --> 02:18:24.382
MATT: She responds, "A quick pit stop, if that is
what you require?"

02:18:24.382 --> 02:18:26.409
LIAM: Ja, ten, 20 minutes. Nothing more.

02:18:26.409 --> 02:18:33.325
MATT: "Very well." The carriage at the front comes
to a slow stop. The second carriage comes to a

02:18:33.325 --> 02:18:43.845
stop. As you all begin to step out of your spaces,
the soft white hills and white fields and small

02:18:43.845 --> 02:18:51.875
elements of the slushy road immediately catch your
vision. There, towards the southern side of the

02:18:51.875 --> 02:19:00.679
eastern hill, you see the single wooden cross
embedded in the somewhat hard, cold earth. There,

02:19:00.679 --> 02:19:08.353
not yet removed from the cross, whether it be by
luck or superstition, there is the white,

02:19:08.353 --> 02:19:12.693
snow-dappled, multicolored coat of Mollymauk
Tealeaf.

02:19:12.693 --> 02:19:21.035
MARISHA: I grab Jester by the hand and walk her
over.

02:19:32.987 --> 02:19:35.651
LAURA: I've never actually been to a grave
before.

02:19:35.651 --> 02:19:36.517
MARISHA: Really?

02:19:36.717 --> 02:19:38.868
LAURA: Not of someone I knew.

02:19:39.297 --> 02:19:42.714
MARISHA: Right. That makes sense.

02:19:46.184 --> 02:19:59.118
LAURA: I get down on my knees. I think he's still
here with us.

02:20:06.008 --> 02:20:07.843
MARISHA: I think so, too.

02:20:12.473 --> 02:20:14.270
LAURA: Thank you, Molly.

02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:22.679
MARISHA: You know, I grabbed his stupid cards.

02:20:22.679 --> 02:20:25.998
LAURA: I love those cards.

02:20:25.998 --> 02:20:28.873
MARISHA: You want to draw one?

02:20:31.593 --> 02:20:32.517
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:32.517 --> 02:20:39.029
LIAM: Caleb scoops Nott up out of the cart that
she's in, and we watch from a distance.

02:20:41.379 --> 02:20:43.174
LAURA: What did I pull?

02:20:43.174 --> 02:20:45.308
MATT: What did she pull?

02:20:50.976 --> 02:20:56.710
TALIESIN: Oh god, I got to think about this. I
think you pulled the moon again.

02:21:02.210 --> 02:21:05.130
LAURA: I pulled this the first time I met him.

02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:09.428
MARISHA: Old faithful.

02:21:13.438 --> 02:21:18.400
LAURA: Well, this is his card. I put it next to
the little stick.

02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:25.208
MARISHA: (sighs)

02:21:25.208 --> 02:21:37.862
TRAVIS: I'll hop off the carriage and walk over.
Staring at the coat, I'll summon the new sword.

02:21:41.582 --> 02:21:53.156
MATT: You watch as the blade emerges. The golden
sheen of the Summer's Dance is crooked towards the

02:21:53.156 --> 02:22:01.299
tip, the previously smooth curvature of it seeming
to have blended with the design of the falchion.

02:22:01.299 --> 02:22:06.906
It's a strange exaggerated blend of the two.

02:22:06.906 --> 02:22:15.724
TRAVIS: In the way that I was taught by Vandren, I
extend the sword to my side, bring it up in a

02:22:15.975 --> 02:22:28.458
salute, swing it back down. I've met a lot of
people, but I don't think I'll ever meet another

02:22:28.458 --> 02:22:32.333
character as unique as you, Molly.

02:22:35.083 --> 02:22:37.489
LIAM: What time of day is it?

02:22:37.489 --> 02:22:44.842
MATT: It's about midday. As you look around at the
nearby clouds, you glance back towards the cart,

02:22:44.842 --> 02:22:55.695
and you see, stepping out of the cloak of
illusion, the leathered, conscious figure of

02:22:55.695 --> 02:23:09.256
Yasha, having shaken herself from the illusory
binds. Groggy and confused, she steps towards the

02:23:09.256 --> 02:23:21.389
rest of you. "What's going on?"

02:23:22.859 --> 02:23:24.784
LAURA: I'm sorry, Yasha.

02:23:27.864 --> 02:23:31.681
TRAVIS: While they were coming to rescue us--

02:23:33.851 --> 02:23:35.664
SAM: We lost him.

02:23:35.664 --> 02:23:40.889
LIAM: He tried to get to your side. He tried very
hard.

02:23:48.509 --> 02:23:55.499
MATT: She takes a few more steps. She seems to
have tuned the rest of you out and is focused on

02:23:55.499 --> 02:24:20.791
the marker. "It happened again." She walks towards
the grave, the crunching of her boots through the

02:24:20.791 --> 02:24:30.164
condensed snowfall, until eventually she comes to
rest at the very point of where he was interred.

02:24:30.164 --> 02:24:39.740
Falls to her knees, her shoulders slumped forward,
her hair, dark to white tumbling past the front of

02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:49.422
her torso. Turned away from you all. Just quiet.

02:24:59.012 --> 02:25:02.340
LAURA: I put my hand on her shoulder.

02:25:05.493 --> 02:25:08.051
MARISHA: I put my hand on the other one.

02:25:12.461 --> 02:25:24.323
MATT: Both of you feel her shoulders quaking. You
can't tell if it's tears, anger, whatever it is,

02:25:24.323 --> 02:25:43.717
it's emotion. You hear a growl. The growl gets
louder and louder as she begins to stand up. All

02:25:43.717 --> 02:25:59.177
of you hear this echoing scream from the depths of
Yasha's soul-- this mournful, baleful cry of anger

02:25:59.177 --> 02:26:14.831
and anguish-- shatter the still, cold air of this
midday sky. The blackened, skeletal wings of her

02:26:14.831 --> 02:26:27.785
fallen aasimar form force both of your hands to
recoil. She looks up to the sky. In the distance,

02:26:27.785 --> 02:26:39.404
you see two or three flashes of blue lightning
from a coalescing storm far to the east. Her head

02:26:39.404 --> 02:26:51.392
lowers, without meeting any of your gaze. She puts
her hand forward on the top of the marker, steps

02:26:51.392 --> 02:26:54.058
around it, and begins walking towards the storm.

02:26:54.058 --> 02:26:56.128
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yasha--

02:26:56.128 --> 02:27:07.520
MATT: She puts her hand up. "I'll find you when
I'm ready." The wings flicker out.

02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:15.323
LIAM: Knowing how young Nott is, I hold her closer
and rest her head on my shoulder and walk away

02:27:15.323 --> 02:27:19.953
from this very painful thing to look at.

02:27:24.493 --> 02:27:34.450
TALIESIN: May I? I'm going to walk up. Move a
little bit of the snow and dig my hand as deep

02:27:34.450 --> 02:27:42.789
into the ground as I can, and attempt to do the
full casting of Decompose and see what I get.

02:27:45.439 --> 02:27:47.737
LAURA: Are you going to make Molly tea?

02:27:53.177 --> 02:27:55.333
MARISHA: (whispering) What's he doing?

02:27:55.333 --> 02:28:03.617
MATT: You finish focusing on the cantrip. It feels
like it sufficiently took root, although you do

02:28:03.617 --> 02:28:07.249
not see any difference, as it is a bit beneath the
dirt.

02:28:07.249 --> 02:28:10.080
TALIESIN: Something will be here.

02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:12.389
MARISHA: What did you just do?

02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:24.647
TALIESIN: I made the earth remember him. Something
will be here. I get back on the cart and leave them.

02:28:29.836 --> 02:28:39.741
TRAVIS: I've said it before, but I'm sorry we
weren't here. To help. We haven't known each other

02:28:39.741 --> 02:28:53.496
that long, but you've shown us incredible kindness
and care, and I'm very grateful for that. I will

02:28:53.496 --> 02:28:58.753
return the favor, if it's ever needed.

02:28:58.753 --> 02:29:09.432
MARISHA: After a while, you lose track of favors.
It's okay.

02:29:09.432 --> 02:29:16.672
TRAVIS: I've never had many favors done my way.

02:29:16.672 --> 02:29:35.832
MARISHA: It wasn't a favor, though. You guys are
the only friends I've ever had. Most people in my

02:29:36.114 --> 02:29:50.082
life just leave. Anyone I'm not driving away. I
guess I should probably try and start keeping

02:29:50.082 --> 02:29:54.150
people around at this point.

02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:57.371
LAURA: I need to get myself some diamonds.

02:29:57.371 --> 02:29:59.941
MARISHA: That is an incredibly random thought.

02:29:59.941 --> 02:30:05.027
LAURA: No, it's so that this doesn't happen
again.

02:30:14.557 --> 02:30:22.977
SAM: I think he would have been happy that you got
to say goodbye. But we should keep going.

02:30:25.639 --> 02:30:30.068
LAURA: (softly) Yeah.

02:30:33.405 --> 02:30:37.990
LIAM: Come, everyone. Molly wanted us to keep
living.

02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:42.627
MARISHA: And make things better.

02:30:46.533 --> 02:30:50.241
LIAM: Back in the carts.

02:30:50.241 --> 02:30:56.888
MATT: As you all turn around and begin making your
way, crunching through the snow, outside of her

02:30:56.888 --> 02:31:03.928
carriage you see Ophelia Mardun, arms crossed,
leaning against the outside of it. As you

02:31:03.928 --> 02:31:09.538
approach, she has a curious tilt to her head, and
she goes, "I assume this is where you lost

02:31:09.538 --> 02:31:12.939
"someone? Unfortunate."

02:31:12.939 --> 02:31:15.746
LIAM: There is always a cost.

02:31:15.746 --> 02:31:26.486
MATT: "Don't I know it. Well, may whoever they
are, may their soul find peace. To whatever that

02:31:26.486 --> 02:31:33.529
"means to them." She turns around and gets back up
into the carriage. With that, you all assemble

02:31:33.529 --> 02:31:43.047
back onto your respective carts and places and
"Hyah!" The carts begin to pick up pace once more,

02:31:43.047 --> 02:31:49.216
and silently, you all glance over your shoulder,
unable to look away, until eventually the hills

02:31:49.216 --> 02:32:11.753
break the horizon, and you're unable to see the
last standing coat and grave site of Mollymauk.

02:32:11.753 --> 02:32:16.947
Now heading southward for a few more days,
trekking down, you find your way towards the

02:32:16.947 --> 02:32:27.240
Crispvale Thicket on the Glory Run Road. There is
the crossroads which turn westward, and then

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:37.045
curving outside of the Crispvale Thicket, towards
Hupperdook and the Silberquel Ridge. Eventually,

02:32:37.045 --> 02:32:43.992
after a couple more days, you pass by and you can
see in the distance, as the night gets dark, the

02:32:43.992 --> 02:32:52.501
glowing lights and the fireworks of Hupperdook's
evening celebrations. Memories calling back to

02:32:52.501 --> 02:33:07.895
that wonderfully colored person. All the joy they
brought. The flowers in their hair and horns.

02:33:07.895 --> 02:33:15.332
Eventually heading back towards the crossroads
that leads towards Felderwin and Berleben.

02:33:15.332 --> 02:33:26.834
Following that path, about eight days of travel
lead you finally to the visual sight of the

02:33:26.834 --> 02:33:34.061
central metropolis of Zadash ahead of you. For
whatever a home could be for this motley family,

02:33:34.061 --> 02:33:42.910
this is it, and you've made it. By the time you
arrive after an evening's camp, you hit the

02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:50.496
northern gates outside of Zadash by about one
o'clock in the afternoon, it would be. Ophelia

02:33:50.496 --> 02:33:59.356
presents her paperwork to the crownsguard that
guard the exterior gate. Without issue, you're let

02:33:59.356 --> 02:34:07.428
in and back to the familiar cobblestone streets of
the district. You can see the Tri-Spires towering

02:34:07.428 --> 02:34:13.816
over the exterior walls that mark that district.
Memories of what you've done here and times that

02:34:13.816 --> 02:34:19.658
you've first met and made whatever small impact
and strange experiences this city had before,

02:34:19.658 --> 02:34:25.189
you've returned. So, Mighty Nein, what do you wish
to do?

02:34:25.189 --> 02:34:28.949
TRAVIS: Out of game, how long have we been gone?
When did we leave Zadash? We've been gone for--

02:34:28.949 --> 02:34:31.286
MARISHA: At least three weeks, right?

02:34:31.286 --> 02:34:33.422
TRAVIS: Feels like a year.

02:34:33.422 --> 02:34:36.683
LIAM: I don't know, but Caleb would know it
exactly.

02:34:36.683 --> 02:34:41.500
MATT: Caleb would know, and I'm sure
CritRoleStats, too, would know. I will

02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:46.497
guesstimate, since the last time I checked in with
them on this and the events you guys have gone

02:34:46.497 --> 02:34:53.465
through, you're three and a half weeks in. You're
pushing somewhere, I'm guessing after all that

02:34:53.465 --> 02:35:04.821
eight days of travel coming down here-- a little
bit less than that, probably. You guys were moving

02:35:04.821 --> 02:35:12.099
slow because you're moving carts, not on
horseback. You're getting pretty close to the 30-day mark.

02:35:12.099 --> 02:35:20.931
LIAM: Also, since we spent so much time in those
carriages, I would have spent a full day with my

02:35:20.931 --> 02:35:31.064
lucky rock that I found, and those ideas I had
have come to fruition. I have set it just so.

02:35:31.064 --> 02:35:33.367
MATT: All right.

02:35:33.367 --> 02:35:35.429
TRAVIS: You got a lucky rock?

02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:37.428
SAM: Yep. That's what this game is about now,
Travis.

02:35:37.428 --> 02:35:40.189
LIAM: I have Luck again. I got a new feat.

02:35:40.189 --> 02:35:41.636
TRAVIS: Oh!

02:35:41.636 --> 02:35:42.440
LIAM: Cheers.

02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:45.035
TRAVIS: Hey, man. Old trick's the best trick.

02:35:45.035 --> 02:35:46.358
MATT: No.

02:35:46.358 --> 02:35:47.529
LIAM: Never again.

02:35:47.529 --> 02:35:50.828
MATT: So what do you wish to do? You've returned
to--

02:35:50.828 --> 02:35:55.316
SAM: We have to bring Ophelia to The Gentleman,
right?

02:35:55.316 --> 02:36:02.049
LIAM: Yeah, but hold on. Also rewind. Seven or
eight days on the road, how much money do we all have?

02:36:02.049 --> 02:36:09.059
SAM: Oh, I did the math between all the platinum
and gold that we found, we should each get 163 gold pieces.

02:36:09.059 --> 02:36:11.585
LIAM: 163?

02:36:11.585 --> 02:36:13.401
MARISHA: Did you break down the platinum?

02:36:13.401 --> 02:36:14.029
SAM: Yes.

02:36:14.029 --> 02:36:15.437
TRAVIS: 101 platinum, 131 gold.

02:36:15.437 --> 02:36:16.625
LIAM: Not as much as I wanted.

02:36:16.625 --> 02:36:18.411
LAURA: Wait a minute. How much gold do I--

02:36:18.411 --> 02:36:20.885
SAM: Including Yasha, who I assume took her
share.

02:36:20.885 --> 02:36:22.235
LIAM: Of course she did.

02:36:22.235 --> 02:36:26.138
TRAVIS: Yes. We threw it and it landed in her
pocket when she ghosted out.

02:36:26.138 --> 02:36:30.167
TALIESIN: Am I getting in this as well?

02:36:30.167 --> 02:36:32.172
SAM: You're part of this as well.

02:36:32.172 --> 02:36:36.440
TALIESIN: Wow! That's awfully nice.

02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:39.142
TRAVIS: We're going to have an introductory
period. You stay for two weeks and then we give

02:36:39.142 --> 02:36:40.416
you your money.

02:36:40.416 --> 02:36:42.344
TALIESIN: That seems very prudent.

02:36:42.344 --> 02:36:45.300
LAURA: Where do I add money?

02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:47.792
MATT: There's a currency tab.

02:36:47.792 --> 02:36:53.293
LIAM: Actions. Spell. Equipment and then touch on
the icons of the coins in D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

02:36:53.293 --> 02:36:55.815
LAURA: Wait a minute, but didn't you guys steal
some money from me?

02:36:55.815 --> 02:36:57.010
SAM: We took a bunch of your gold.

02:36:57.010 --> 02:36:58.134
MARISHA: We took about 70 gold.

02:36:58.134 --> 02:36:59.563
LIAM: No, of course not.

02:36:59.563 --> 02:37:01.219
SAM: We took 70 gold.

02:37:01.219 --> 02:37:02.884
LAURA: I got a lot of tweets about it.

02:37:02.884 --> 02:37:06.045
TALIESIN: Thanks, guys.

02:37:06.045 --> 02:37:07.789
SAM: We took some of Molly's gold.

02:37:07.789 --> 02:37:10.359
LIAM: The internet's full of troublemakers.

02:37:10.359 --> 02:37:17.228
TALIESIN: Thanks, guys. That's the last time we
let you be in on our secrets. So it's how much

02:37:17.228 --> 02:37:18.718
gold, how much platinum?

02:37:18.718 --> 02:37:21.653
SAM: 163 gold. I just broke it down into gold.

02:37:21.653 --> 02:37:24.859
LIAM: But it's all platinum. Right?

02:37:24.859 --> 02:37:26.215
SAM: Who cares?

02:37:26.215 --> 02:37:27.977
LIAM: He might.

02:37:27.977 --> 02:37:31.054
SAM: Matt, did we find a bank to break change on
the way?

02:37:31.054 --> 02:37:36.901
MATT: I can say, if you'd like to, there are ways
to transition the money. For ease, you can say

02:37:36.901 --> 02:37:42.233
gold piece value for keeping tabs on it, but you
can say that a portion of it is platinum for ease

02:37:42.233 --> 02:37:44.216
of travel. Though you have a bag of holding; it's
not a huge issue.

02:37:44.582 --> 02:37:45.793
SAM: Okay.

02:37:45.793 --> 02:37:48.442
MATT: Bag of holding is one of those items where
eventually, when you reach a certain level, you're

02:37:48.442 --> 02:37:53.425
like, "You know what? Let's not worry about all
that copper and silver and gold piece weight with you."

02:37:53.622 --> 02:37:55.370
LIAM: We all have roughly 30-something platinum.

02:37:55.370 --> 02:37:57.150
TRAVIS: Dope.

02:37:57.150 --> 02:38:00.275
MATT: Be glad you rolled at least a 15 on that
investigation check, or you never would have found

02:38:00.275 --> 02:38:02.202
a bag of holding.

02:38:02.202 --> 02:38:03.746
TRAVIS: Holy Jesus.

02:38:03.746 --> 02:38:04.825
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:38:04.825 --> 02:38:06.118
LIAM: Detective!

02:38:06.118 --> 02:38:08.787
MARISHA: I rolled like crap, considering.

02:38:08.787 --> 02:38:15.521
MATT: I know I don't show the notes there
regularly, but that is the 15 plus investigation.

02:38:15.521 --> 02:38:16.718
TRAVIS: Yep. Oh my god.

02:38:16.718 --> 02:38:20.963
LIAM: We don't doubt you, Matt. We don't doubt
you. I know you don't sleep. I know you stare at a

02:38:20.963 --> 02:38:23.813
computer monitor and think up numbers for us
non-stop.

02:38:23.813 --> 02:38:27.458
MATT: I should be better about being a human
being.

02:38:27.458 --> 02:38:31.948
LIAM: (robotic voice) It's all good.

02:38:31.948 --> 02:38:39.448
MATT: The carriages make their way, beelining, as
if they know where to go, towards The Evening Nip.

02:38:39.448 --> 02:38:43.707
SAM: Do we remember the code to get in? What is
it? You say, like, "I need a drink."

02:38:43.707 --> 02:38:45.969
LIAM: "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

02:38:45.969 --> 02:38:49.436
SAM: Yeah. What is it? "I am here to help."

02:38:49.436 --> 02:38:52.117
MARISHA: It's like, "I need to speak to The
Gentleman?"

02:38:52.117 --> 02:38:55.053
LAURA: "I want some milk," or something.

02:38:55.053 --> 02:38:56.440
LIAM: It's a phrase.

02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:57.897
MARISHA: I have it written down somewhere.

02:38:57.897 --> 02:38:59.710
SAM: Maybe Ophelia knows.

02:38:59.710 --> 02:39:01.060
MARISHA: I'm sure we're fine.

02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:03.539
SAM: Ophelia, do you know the secret code?

02:39:03.539 --> 02:39:06.101
LIAM: "I'd like to offer many gifts."

02:39:06.101 --> 02:39:07.542
MATT: That is indeed it.

02:39:07.542 --> 02:39:10.050
LIAM: Bitches.

02:39:10.050 --> 02:39:15.536
MATT: The carriages eventually find their way,
snaking through the sometimes narrow streets of

02:39:15.536 --> 02:39:21.066
Zadash, until eventually you find your way to the
outskirts of The Evening Nip. The carriages stop.

02:39:22.846 --> 02:39:27.751
I imagine the carts would come to a stop as well,
those who are driving them. Ophelia steps out and

02:39:27.751 --> 02:39:34.413
her drivers hold view on this. Ophelia heads
towards and waits at the doorway to The Evening

02:39:34.413 --> 02:39:39.992
Nip. One of her drivers comes up behind her with
the bags that she had packaged in the carriage,

02:39:39.992 --> 02:39:44.475
and as you guys step off of them, one of the
carriages is then brought around the back to The

02:39:44.475 --> 02:39:49.227
Evening Nip. She has her arms crossed. "Well, are
you all coming?"

02:39:49.227 --> 02:39:51.412
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:39:51.412 --> 02:39:53.151
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

02:39:53.151 --> 02:39:59.359
MATT: "Good. Follow me." She steps inside. As you
all step into the dark interior of the tavern, the

02:39:59.359 --> 02:40:05.327
first thing you see amongst the various empty
tables and booths in this small, divey tavern. The

02:40:05.327 --> 02:40:11.751
familiar smell of stained wood and strong liquors
spilled on floors that have long warped and been

02:40:11.751 --> 02:40:19.244
stained with all sorts of drinks and chemicals.
You see the gruff, dwarven bartender, Clive, look

02:40:19.244 --> 02:40:25.323
back at you. His chin chewing something on the
inside of his mouth. "Ah, I was given word you

02:40:25.323 --> 02:40:30.911
"might show up. Most likely not, mind you, but word
was given. Go ahead."

02:40:30.911 --> 02:40:32.666
LAURA: I have many gifts.

02:40:32.666 --> 02:40:34.179
MATT: "Right, right. No, I've seen you before."

02:40:34.179 --> 02:40:36.149
LAURA: Yeah, but I do have many gifts, though.

02:40:36.149 --> 02:40:37.850
MATT: "All right, well bring them up."

02:40:37.850 --> 02:40:41.581
SAM: It worked!

02:40:41.581 --> 02:40:48.999
MATT: Ophelia looks like she is trying to recall
something. She's like, "It's round that way." She

02:40:48.999 --> 02:40:52.727
follows you in. It looks like she is trying to
recall, like it's been a while since she's been here.

02:40:52.727 --> 02:40:56.335
MARISHA: I go: Yeah, it's this way. That's to the
bathroom.

02:40:56.335 --> 02:40:57.776
MATT: "Right, I know. I remember."

02:40:57.776 --> 02:41:02.245
TRAVIS: As were heading down, I'll drop my Mask of
Many Faces.

02:41:02.245 --> 02:41:09.164
MATT: You find the trap door, open it, and you
begin to descend the tight spiral staircase that

02:41:09.164 --> 02:41:16.578
leads into the under-chambers of The Gentleman's
lair. As you reach the base of it, you can hear

02:41:16.578 --> 02:41:22.836
the sound of a lazy harp playing inside the
stone-case chamber. Across the way, you can see

02:41:22.836 --> 02:41:28.768
the individual playing the harp is Kara, who's
leaned against the bar on a stool. Her legs up on

02:41:28.768 --> 02:41:33.510
the edge of a table and just a little, small
compact harp, which she is plucking away at

02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:42.240
lazily. Looks like she may have been imbibing
early this day. The usual suspects fill two of the

02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:49.076
tables. The same ogre guardian eyeing you all with
both familiarity and general mindless suspicion.

02:41:49.076 --> 02:41:51.992
TRAVIS: Kutha, how's it been?

02:41:51.992 --> 02:41:55.147
MATT: (grunts)

02:41:55.147 --> 02:41:59.647
TRAVIS: Yeah, very talkative for him, actually.

02:41:59.647 --> 02:42:07.918
MATT: The left table appears to be rather crowded.
There is a card game afoot. The Gentleman is

02:42:07.918 --> 02:42:14.096
amongst this group, most of the general attendees
of this area, the Underworks, seem to have been

02:42:14.096 --> 02:42:18.410
gathered here. There's seven players at the table
at this point and the others are just watching

02:42:18.410 --> 02:42:23.129
from the outskirts and they're in the middle of a
rather tense hand. There is quite a pile of coin;

02:42:23.129 --> 02:42:27.758
a variety of copper, silver, and gold all thrown
in, a handful of platinum thrown in the mix. This

02:42:27.758 --> 02:42:33.667
looks like some sort of crescendo as The Gentleman
is there looking at his cards in his hand. His

02:42:33.667 --> 02:42:37.905
eyes quickly glance up and notice you approach,
and he gives an acknowledging nod and he goes

02:42:37.905 --> 02:42:42.568
right back to his hand. He's focused on the other
players at the table. Behind him, you can see

02:42:42.568 --> 02:42:50.369
looming Sorah, his half-giant guardian, still
standing there over him. Her arms crossed and she

02:42:50.369 --> 02:42:54.770
just watches as you approach, and then looks very
carefully over everyone at the table to make sure

02:42:54.853 --> 02:43:03.227
everyone's hands are visible. At this point,
everyone's hands are called and one by one each

02:43:03.227 --> 02:43:09.161
hand hits the table and then, at once, you see
this raucous cry and scream of excitement and boos

02:43:09.161 --> 02:43:15.400
all at once and The Gentleman throws his cards
down, shaking his head as he accepts defeat, and

02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:20.648
one of his handyman manages to scrape the coins
off the table. He goes and reaches over to a bowl

02:43:20.648 --> 02:43:25.152
on the table behind him and pulls what looks to be
a fresh strawberry that's been cleaned perfectly,

02:43:25.152 --> 02:43:29.657
none of the green remaining at the top, pops it
into his mouth, chews for a second, and looks over

02:43:29.657 --> 02:43:33.982
to the rest of you. As he glances at the direction
and points a finger, everyone looks over their

02:43:33.982 --> 02:43:37.804
shoulder and notices your approach and they begin
to pick up their cards and it seems like the

02:43:37.804 --> 02:43:45.659
gaming session is done with your arrival. The
Gentleman looks over and goes, "My, my, my.

02:43:45.659 --> 02:43:52.241
"(laughs) I would have easily read my opponents had
my eyes not been so blinded by beauty." As he

02:43:52.241 --> 02:43:59.227
looks towards Ophelia, he sits up and she puts her
hand out and he takes the hand and kisses it, and

02:43:59.227 --> 02:44:05.326
then in one rapid movement grabs her arm, stands
up, and sweeps her around in his arm and brings

02:44:05.326 --> 02:44:10.503
her in for this really passionate kiss. There's a
moment where they're both just locked in before he

02:44:10.503 --> 02:44:15.575
goes (loud grunt) and pulls away and grasps his
lip, and you can see there's blood now curling

02:44:15.575 --> 02:44:23.642
down. She sits there and licks the blood and goes,
"It has been awhile, my azure lover. However,

02:44:23.642 --> 02:44:38.950
"business before pleasure." He wipes his lip a bit
for a second, "Well, you've upheld your promise

02:44:38.950 --> 02:44:47.741
"and sent, it seems, a successful endeavor, right?
I assume since you've returned with her." She

02:44:47.741 --> 02:44:55.143
goes, "They are a very capable team, indeed.
Consider our debt paid," she says to The

02:44:55.143 --> 02:45:01.989
Gentleman. "Now, I would like to see their debt
paid, as well, for they have paid for their

02:45:01.989 --> 02:45:10.898
"service in blood." The Gentleman stands up at his
table: "Of course, my dear, of course. I am sorry

02:45:10.898 --> 02:45:18.789
"to hear that." He looks amongst you all and looks
over to you and gives a curious look, and keeps

02:45:18.789 --> 02:45:31.718
glancing about. "Ah. I see what she refers to. My
apologies. However, that is the way of the

02:45:31.718 --> 02:45:39.452
"entrepreneurial sellsword, is it not? And--" He
seems to be making a calculation in his mind for a

02:45:39.452 --> 02:45:45.492
moment. "We are on schedule!"

02:45:45.492 --> 02:45:47.151
LAURA: Did you get my messages?

02:45:47.151 --> 02:45:53.160
MATT: "I did, and thank you very much. Actually,
the storehouse is already up and running again, so

02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:56.895
thank you very much for the notification. That
saved us some time, as well."

02:45:56.895 --> 02:45:59.316
SAM: That's the tree place, right?

02:45:59.316 --> 02:46:03.386
MATT: "That is a way of explaining it, yes."

02:46:03.386 --> 02:46:10.666
SAM: Also, Mr. Gentleman, sir, we didn't catch you
at a bad time, did we? It seems that you just

02:46:10.666 --> 02:46:19.804
stepped out of the shower, or something? Should we
come back after you've dried yourself off and made

02:46:19.804 --> 02:46:24.896
yourself presentable?

02:46:24.896 --> 02:46:30.657
MATT: You watch as the glimmer of confidence in
his eyes sets into this glare for a second, and

02:46:30.657 --> 02:46:41.733
then he (laughs) "I'll be fine. Well, your
contract is fulfilled. Ms. Mardun and I will take

02:46:41.733 --> 02:46:49.797
"the week to re-establish our trade line, and I
think you've earned every copper." He looks over

02:46:50.087 --> 02:46:58.269
his shoulder and two of his various goons come
over with a heavy chest. (strained grunt) onto the

02:46:58.269 --> 02:47:03.175
table. It hits with a very mighty strike and the
whole table shakes for a second. They open it: it

02:47:03.175 --> 02:47:08.374
is filled with gold and platinum coins.

02:47:08.374 --> 02:47:13.387
MARISHA: Pay day!

02:47:13.387 --> 02:47:16.597
MATT: Glancing in, it's mostly platinum.

02:47:16.597 --> 02:47:20.160
TRAVIS: Got hundreds, y'all!

02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:31.496
MATT: He pushes it forward, and it comes to about
600 platinum pieces and 250 gold pieces.

02:47:31.496 --> 02:47:41.945
LIAM: 3250 gold, it's platinum plus gold, around
600 platinum pieces times five.

02:47:41.945 --> 02:47:43.163
SAM: Times five?

02:47:43.163 --> 02:47:44.387
MATT: Times ten.

02:47:44.387 --> 02:47:48.412
LIAM: Times ten? Even better.

02:47:48.412 --> 02:47:55.399
MATT: The remaining sum for the agreement you had
made was 6250 gold pieces for both jobs being

02:47:55.399 --> 02:48:01.777
completed. He had paid some in advance and given
you some funds, but this is the rest of the agreed upon amount.

02:48:01.777 --> 02:48:05.207
LIAM: Hundred silver, y'all.

02:48:05.207 --> 02:48:08.103
SAM: I think your math is off.

02:48:08.103 --> 02:48:13.414
MATT: He then reaches back into a small belt pouch
that is carefully hidden on the inside of his

02:48:13.414 --> 02:48:20.072
belt, counts out a few coins and throws them
across the table towards you. It looks to be

02:48:20.072 --> 02:48:23.222
another 50 or so platinum.

02:48:23.222 --> 02:48:24.291
MARISHA: We got a tip?

02:48:24.291 --> 02:48:25.488
SAM: What is this, a tip?

02:48:25.488 --> 02:48:29.251
MATT: "For your loss and your troubles."

02:48:29.251 --> 02:48:31.801
SAM: That is very honorable.

02:48:31.801 --> 02:48:39.667
MATT: "I'm nothing if not. So you have a new
companion that you've dragged into my sanctum?"

02:48:39.667 --> 02:48:42.419
LAURA: He has many gifts to offer.

02:48:42.419 --> 02:48:45.234
TALIESIN: I have no idea what's going on right
now.

02:48:45.234 --> 02:48:53.017
SAM: Mr. Clay, this is "money" and you can use it
to by things like goods or services.

02:48:53.017 --> 02:48:54.631
TALIESIN: What kind of goods and services?

02:48:54.631 --> 02:48:56.882
SAM: Oh, you know, like tailoring services.

02:48:56.882 --> 02:48:59.050
LIAM: What are you interested in?

02:48:59.050 --> 02:49:02.820
TALIESIN: I know what money is; I'm just having
fun with Nott.

02:49:02.820 --> 02:49:05.486
LIAM: Well, but still, what are you interested
in?

02:49:05.486 --> 02:49:13.417
TALIESIN: You know, I've never really thought
about it before. Yeah, I can think of about four

02:49:13.417 --> 02:49:17.468
things I'd like to get. That's nice. Yeah.

02:49:17.468 --> 02:49:19.942
LIAM: I'm sure they have a lot of tea blends here
in Zadash.

02:49:19.942 --> 02:49:26.904
TALIESIN: Well, and I could probably use a new tea
set and maybe a new skillet--

02:49:26.904 --> 02:49:29.684
LIAM: You had three cups, so you need (counting).

02:49:29.684 --> 02:49:33.570
SAM: Yeah, so are the four things to make a set of
seven?

02:49:33.570 --> 02:49:36.933
TALIESIN: This ought to cover it just fine.

02:49:36.933 --> 02:49:38.468
LAURA: You like rings?

02:49:38.468 --> 02:49:39.235
TALIESIN: No, I'm okay.

02:49:39.235 --> 02:49:41.412
LAURA: Whoa!

02:49:41.412 --> 02:49:50.600
MATT: "Well, regardless, you have two choices
here: either we kill you or we take a bit of your

02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:53.388
"essence to keep tabs."

02:49:54.571 --> 02:49:56.125
LAURA: Sorry about that.

02:49:56.125 --> 02:49:58.302
MARISHA: Yeah, we probably should've told you that
before we brought you in here.

02:49:58.302 --> 02:50:00.578
TRAVIS: They all have a little collection of our
blood in vials.

02:50:00.578 --> 02:50:04.466
MATT: "It's just a formality. We need to protect
our interests as much as yours. I hope you

02:50:04.466 --> 02:50:10.622
"understand, Mr.--? Miss? Whatever you'd like."

02:50:10.997 --> 02:50:12.687
TALIESIN: Clay. Mr. Clay.

02:50:12.687 --> 02:50:14.618
MATT: "Mr. Clay."

02:50:14.618 --> 02:50:26.539
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and get an insight
check on this interesting individual. 23.

02:50:26.539 --> 02:50:29.479
SAM: Ooh, secrets.

02:50:29.479 --> 02:50:32.141
LIAM: (whispering) Secrets.

02:50:32.141 --> 02:50:33.180
SAM: Hey, Laura?

02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:34.321
LAURA: Hey, yeah, Sam?

02:50:34.321 --> 02:50:38.323
SAM: How do you like the new layout of the D&amp;amp;D
Beyond app? I don't think you've used it yet.

02:50:38.323 --> 02:50:42.973
LAURA: No, this is my first time looking at it,
but I'll tell you what, it sure is... great.

02:50:42.973 --> 02:50:45.302
SAM: Wow.

02:50:45.302 --> 02:50:49.038
LAURA: My brain isn't working. I was trying to
think of a word for--

02:50:49.038 --> 02:50:53.529
TRAVIS: Boy, is it efficient! Everything I want is
now in condensed--

02:50:53.529 --> 02:50:58.381
LIAM: Man, your schlocky bit is great and all, but
it is really good to have you two at the table

02:50:58.381 --> 02:51:04.802
again. It'd only be better if Ashley was here, but
it is really good to have you two back. Fucking

02:51:04.802 --> 02:51:09.565
for real. Ja, okay, as you were.

02:51:09.565 --> 02:51:12.133
TALIESIN: Okay, but I'm going to need something.

02:51:12.133 --> 02:51:15.038
MATT: (chuckles) "Curious. Tell me what you
need."

02:51:15.038 --> 02:51:23.815
TALIESIN: I need you to promise not to do anything
untoward with it. Whatever you're going to do and

02:51:23.815 --> 02:51:28.639
what you need it for, obviously everyone seemed
okay with that. I need you to promise that you're

02:51:28.639 --> 02:51:34.205
not going to cast anything weird or-- you know.

02:51:34.205 --> 02:51:37.612
MATT: "You have my word as a gentleman."

02:51:37.612 --> 02:51:39.528
TALIESIN: That seems fair.

02:51:39.528 --> 02:51:45.640
MATT: "All right. Cree!" From around the corner,
finishing a meal, the dark-furred, yellow-eyed

02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:54.224
tabaxi woman begins to approach, pulling a small
satchel, pulling open the flap,

02:51:54.224 --> 02:51:58.189
and taking out a small blade.

02:51:58.189 --> 02:52:05.641
TALIESIN: I can do it. I'm going to get one of my
beetles to come out and bite my finger for me.

02:52:05.641 --> 02:52:08.537
MATT: "Oh! How strange."

02:52:08.537 --> 02:52:10.332
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:52:10.332 --> 02:52:18.200
MATT: She pulls one vial out of her satchel,
uncorking it. As she curls a finger upward, the

02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:25.361
blood seems to lift in a slow arc out of the
wound, and drift, dancing through the air, and

02:52:25.361 --> 02:52:32.238
then into the vial, before it's filled to about
halfway. The blood flow staunches, and it

02:52:32.238 --> 02:52:37.633
completes the vial to about three quarters. She
corks it and puts it back into the satchel,

02:52:37.633 --> 02:52:41.731
closing it. "Thank you very much for your
donation."

02:52:41.731 --> 02:52:44.878
TALIESIN: You're welcome. I'm going to really
quickly cast Eyes of the Grave. Are there any

02:52:44.878 --> 02:52:47.456
undead within 60 feet?

02:52:47.456 --> 02:52:50.791
MATT: Interesting point. No. No undead within 60
feet.

02:52:50.791 --> 02:52:52.022
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:52:52.022 --> 02:52:54.144
MATT: You feel a little more comfortable knowing
that.

02:52:54.144 --> 02:52:55.371
TALIESIN: Just wanted to check.

02:52:55.371 --> 02:53:00.749
MATT: Cree turns to you and goes, "I hate to
bother, but-- I'm happy to see you return. I see

02:53:00.749 --> 02:53:02.724
"that Lucien is not with you."

02:53:02.724 --> 02:53:05.067
SAM: Oh. Yes.

02:53:05.067 --> 02:53:13.460
LIAM: That is correct. He had his own business to
attend to. We parted ways.

02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:17.312
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:53:17.312 --> 02:53:20.959
SAM: Oh, boy.

02:53:20.959 --> 02:53:26.266
LIAM: Natural 20. Thanks, Matt Colville!

02:53:26.266 --> 02:53:37.817
MATT: "All right. Should you cross paths with him
again, tell him that Cree would like to see him.

02:53:37.817 --> 02:53:40.809
"It's been so brief since we've been reunited."

02:53:40.809 --> 02:53:47.303
LIAM: It didn't end well. It seems doubtful, but
ja, if we see him again, rest assured.

02:53:47.303 --> 02:53:54.725
MATT: "Very well. Anyway, it is good to see all of
you. Welcome back. The Gentleman is pleased with

02:53:54.725 --> 02:54:02.878
"your success. Yes." Then turns around and shuffles
her way back to where she was sitting.

02:54:02.878 --> 02:54:04.307
LAURA: Can I ask a question, Matthew?

02:54:04.307 --> 02:54:05.784
MATT: Yes, you may.

02:54:05.784 --> 02:54:11.287
LAURA: Do we know what day it is? Is it past
Quen'pillar?

02:54:11.287 --> 02:54:23.233
MATT: It's probably right on the cusp of
Quen'pillar, because that shift happened with the

02:54:23.233 --> 02:54:27.940
Harvest Close festival, if I recall. I'll
double-check, after the episode, to be sure it's

02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:34.216
the right answer. You're right on the cusp, if not
right now entering to that month.

02:54:34.216 --> 02:54:44.314
TRAVIS: Could I get The Gentleman's attention and
say: This adventure has been thorough. A name came

02:54:44.314 --> 02:54:52.141
up in our travels, and I was wondering if you may
have heard of someone, a Marius LePual.

02:54:52.141 --> 02:54:56.619
SAM and LAURA: (whispering furiously) What are you
doing!?

02:54:56.619 --> 02:55:00.235
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

02:55:00.235 --> 02:55:01.612
SAM: Go on.

02:55:01.701 --> 02:55:08.305
MATT: "Ah--" As you're talking to him, his eyes
are locked over to Ophelia. "I can't say that

02:55:08.305 --> 02:55:13.043
"rings a bell, but I can certainly ask my contacts,
if you're looking for information about this

02:55:13.043 --> 02:55:15.403
"individual. What was his name?"

02:55:15.403 --> 02:55:22.724
TRAVIS: Marius LePwel. Pwal. P-U-A-L.

02:55:22.724 --> 02:55:26.419
MATT: "I'll look into it. Don't worry."

02:55:26.419 --> 02:55:29.041
TRAVIS: Appreciate it.

02:55:29.041 --> 02:55:33.552
MATT: "Pleasure is mine, Fjord. Anything else you
require? Otherwise, I believe you have some money

02:55:33.552 --> 02:55:35.340
"to spend."

02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:36.311
SAM: Oh, yes!

02:55:36.311 --> 02:55:36.936
LAURA: So much!

02:55:36.936 --> 02:55:37.741
SAM: Thank you!

02:55:37.741 --> 02:55:39.704
MARISHA: Is it still an open bar?

02:55:39.704 --> 02:55:43.754
MATT: "When is it not? Please, be my guests."

02:55:43.754 --> 02:55:46.403
MARISHA: I go to the bar.

02:55:46.403 --> 02:55:49.712
MATT: A round of liquor for all you'd like.

02:55:49.712 --> 02:55:52.747
TALIESIN: I'll take whatever's not liquor.

02:55:52.747 --> 02:55:54.058
TRAVIS: Do you have any milk?

02:55:54.058 --> 02:55:55.650
LAURA: They do have milk. I've had it before.

02:55:55.650 --> 02:55:56.860
MATT: They do have milk.

02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:57.937
TALIESIN: I don't think I've ever had milk.

02:55:57.937 --> 02:56:01.823
LAURA: (gasp) Oh, you have to try it. It's so
good.

02:56:01.823 --> 02:56:02.977
TALIESIN: I'm going to try milk.

02:56:02.977 --> 02:56:09.505
MATT: It's not particularly chilled. It's thick,
and creamy. It's your choice whether or not it's

02:56:09.505 --> 02:56:15.690
your preference based on how you lived most of
your life.

02:56:15.690 --> 02:56:18.579
TALIESIN: This is weird. I'm not sure.

02:56:18.579 --> 02:56:23.471
SAM: It's from a cow!

02:56:23.471 --> 02:56:25.857
LAURA: Or a goat. It could be from a goat.

02:56:25.857 --> 02:56:26.747
SAM: Could be a goat.

02:56:26.747 --> 02:56:28.748
LAURA: It could be from a mom.

02:56:28.748 --> 02:56:32.717
TALIESIN: That's just weird. It's very weird.

02:56:32.717 --> 02:56:38.244
SAM: Maybe just have some tea. They might have
tea. Do you have tea?

02:56:38.244 --> 02:56:43.674
MATT: Then the barkeep, who's the ragged
middle-aged man who's running the bar at the

02:56:43.674 --> 02:56:49.250
moment. One eye, you don't know if it's swollen
shut or if he's missing an eye or he's just

02:56:49.250 --> 02:56:56.493
wanting to study you very closely with the left
one. He leans forward and goes, "You're joking, right?"

02:56:56.493 --> 02:57:00.304
SAM: (forced) Ha! Yeah. (forced laughter)

02:57:00.304 --> 02:57:03.143
MATT: "It's funny, It's a funny joke, that's a
really funny joke."

02:57:03.143 --> 02:57:04.295
SAM: It's a good one. I've been working on it.

02:57:04.295 --> 02:57:05.944
MATT: "I can tell. It's workshopped well."

02:57:05.944 --> 02:57:08.928
SAM: Well, we'll just have some whiskey, then.

02:57:08.928 --> 02:57:13.758
MATT: "Whiskey, I got you whiskey." Puts a couple
shots on the bar, fills them up.

02:57:13.758 --> 02:57:15.739
SAM: Try it, Mr. Clay.

02:57:15.739 --> 02:57:17.775
TALIESIN: (sniffs) Oh, that's a little strong.

02:57:17.775 --> 02:57:21.905
SAM: It's from the earth, though, they made it
from grains.

02:57:21.905 --> 02:57:25.725
TALIESIN: (sniffs) I'm not sure this is-- this
doesn't--

02:57:25.725 --> 02:57:31.386
SAM: They take wheat and barley and stuff and then
they mash it up and let sit outside-- they let it

02:57:31.386 --> 02:57:37.661
decompose a little bit!

02:57:37.661 --> 02:57:39.625
TRAVIS: Please Roger Rabbit--

02:57:39.625 --> 02:57:42.644
TALIESIN: Am I aware that he doesn't know-- okay.
Am I aware that Sam doesn't actually know how

02:57:42.644 --> 02:57:44.481
whiskey's made?

02:57:44.481 --> 02:57:48.196
SAM: That's how you do it! You take some, mash it
together. Put it in a barrel.

02:57:48.196 --> 02:57:55.334
TALIESIN: Oh, god, I don't know any of this, do I?
Okay. Yeah, sure, okay, apparently.

02:57:55.334 --> 02:57:58.468
TRAVIS: Yeah! Drink it!

02:57:58.468 --> 02:57:59.998
SAM: Let's have a shot!

02:57:59.998 --> 02:58:03.372
TALIESIN: Finish getting angry at Sam. Here we
go.

02:58:03.372 --> 02:58:10.076
MATT: Together, both tiny goblin Nott, with her
rather large, comparatively, shot glass and very

02:58:10.076 --> 02:58:15.840
large Caduceus Clay, with a comparatively really
tiny shot glass, both, in unison, slam back.

02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:24.695
TALIESIN: (coughing)

02:58:24.695 --> 02:58:27.803
MATT: Bartender's already refilled yours.

02:58:27.803 --> 02:58:30.196
TALIESIN: (hoarsely) Is it supposed to do that?

02:58:30.196 --> 02:58:39.657
SAM: Oh, yes, very much. The earth is calling you
to her.

02:58:39.657 --> 02:58:50.726
TALIESIN: (groaning and coughing) (hoarsely) Do
you have anything to take the edge off?

02:58:50.726 --> 02:58:52.386
LAURA: Try some milk. That always helps.

02:58:52.386 --> 02:58:55.085
MATT: He pours another glass of milk and pushes it
forward.

02:58:55.085 --> 02:58:57.728
TRAVIS: A milk chaser for your whiskeys?

02:58:57.728 --> 02:59:03.801
TALIESIN: Oh, this is what people drink?

02:59:03.801 --> 02:59:06.477
MARISHA: (stage whisper) Someone give him a white
russian!

02:59:06.477 --> 02:59:09.737
(laughter)

02:59:09.737 --> 02:59:13.973
TRAVIS: How did we not go there first! Oh my god.

02:59:13.973 --> 02:59:15.830
MARISHA: If you like milk, you'll love this.

02:59:15.830 --> 02:59:18.721
TRAVIS: You got any Kahlua back there?

02:59:18.721 --> 02:59:20.465
TALIESIN: You're the worst people!

02:59:20.465 --> 02:59:23.392
MATT: Ever had a Cement Mixer?

02:59:23.392 --> 02:59:27.587
TRAVIS: Can I find-- is it Kara?

02:59:27.587 --> 02:59:31.833
MATT: Kara. She's at the back, waiting. She's
watching you as you approach.

02:59:31.833 --> 02:59:39.830
TRAVIS: We were gone for a while. When we left,
Zadash was in a it of a tizzy. How is it in the city?

02:59:39.834 --> 02:59:46.447
MATT: "It's apparently all right. Most of the
business has made its way eastward. Things have

02:59:46.731 --> 02:59:48.477
gone back to normal."

02:59:48.477 --> 02:59:50.605
TRAVIS: Troop presence about the same?

02:59:50.605 --> 02:59:55.557
MATT: "Oh, most of the troop presence made its way
out towards where the outposts were."

02:59:55.557 --> 02:59:58.948
TRAVIS: Any coming back? Any wounded, any--?

02:59:58.948 --> 03:00:01.023
MATT: "Not that I've been paying attention to at
least."

03:00:01.023 --> 03:00:03.354
TRAVIS: No incursions, no security problems?

03:00:03.354 --> 03:00:06.046
MATT: "Not right now."

03:00:06.046 --> 03:00:07.437
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:00:07.437 --> 03:00:16.685
MATT: "Of course. Come back and ask tomorrow, it
might change, but-- Hey. Glad you're well."

03:00:16.685 --> 03:00:22.104
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:00:22.104 --> 03:00:28.057
MARISHA: You all right there, bud?

03:00:28.057 --> 03:00:29.952
TRAVIS: I don't think I take compliments very
well.

03:00:29.952 --> 03:00:31.035
MARISHA: No, you don't.

03:00:31.035 --> 03:00:36.056
TRAVIS: Yeah. Whiskey!

03:00:36.056 --> 03:00:41.500
MATT: The drinks are served around, you guys can
take as much time here as you'd like to. Whatever

03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:43.057
you'd like to do.

03:00:43.057 --> 03:00:44.477
SAM: We can leave, right?

03:00:44.477 --> 03:00:47.223
MATT: Yeah, whatever you want. You can do whatever
you want to do. The city is yours.

03:00:47.223 --> 03:00:50.805
LIAM: I'm going to plonk down in front of Fjord,
just for a minute, after everybody's milling about

03:00:50.805 --> 03:00:53.192
for a while.

03:00:53.192 --> 03:01:01.609
MARISHA: I'm going to sit down as well. Sit in a
little booth in the back corner. Back corner boothin'.

03:01:02.715 --> 03:01:18.815
LIAM: This may be the alcohol-- it's the alcohol.
Raise a glass, you two assholes. Here is to

03:01:18.815 --> 03:01:21.350
fucking making it work.

03:01:21.350 --> 03:01:24.327
MARISHA: Oh god.

03:01:24.327 --> 03:01:27.169
TRAVIS: You got out of that without any liquor on
you. Real impressive.

03:01:27.169 --> 03:01:29.844
MARISHA: Yeah, it was honestly-- this is why I
don't wear white.

03:01:29.844 --> 03:01:31.583
TRAVIS: Cheers.

03:01:31.583 --> 03:01:33.461
LIAM: Congratulations on being alive.

03:01:33.461 --> 03:01:37.834
TRAVIS and LIAM: Yeah.

03:01:37.834 --> 03:01:47.331
MARISHA: Fjord, you survived being chained up and
tortured. That's got to fuck with a person, right?

03:01:47.331 --> 03:01:58.415
TRAVIS: Yeah, it-- More the disappointment. I
expect better of myself. Let you guys down, I let

03:01:58.415 --> 03:02:04.246
Jester down, I let Yasha down. I'll never be able
to shake this.

03:02:04.246 --> 03:02:09.758
MARISHA: Fjord, you cannot keep blaming yourself
when you were the victim in this circumstance. You

03:02:09.758 --> 03:02:12.222
understand that, right?

03:02:12.222 --> 03:02:14.194
TRAVIS: No, I don't.

03:02:14.194 --> 03:02:18.607
MARISHA: There are people to blame. I wasn't
joking when I said it was someone's fault earlier,

03:02:18.607 --> 03:02:25.476
but it is not yours. The only person whose fucking
fault it was is that fucking asshole Lorenzo's and

03:02:25.476 --> 03:02:29.392
fucking human traffickers.

03:02:29.392 --> 03:02:32.420
TRAVIS: No, I get that. I do.

03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:45.248
LIAM: You cannot blame yourself when you are taken
advantage of. You know what I mean?

03:02:45.248 --> 03:02:54.077
TRAVIS: You don't understand, though. My whole
life was trying to blend in, trying to keep an eye

03:02:54.077 --> 03:03:01.004
out for someone that was looking to take
advantage, that was going to exploit. I got

03:03:01.004 --> 03:03:10.053
comfortable. I felt relaxed. There's no reason why
the three of us out on watch couldn't see them

03:03:10.053 --> 03:03:14.082
coming out and raise an alarm fast enough.

03:03:14.082 --> 03:03:20.417
MARISHA: There's also no reason that the three of
us couldn't have made a fucking plan that couldn't

03:03:20.417 --> 03:03:22.555
have gotten Molly killed.

03:03:22.555 --> 03:03:24.575
TRAVIS: I'll drink to that.

03:03:24.575 --> 03:03:31.561
LIAM: No, and we're never going to forget it. It's
going to ride with us until we're dead.

03:03:31.561 --> 03:03:38.276
TRAVIS: Yeah. It puts everything in perspective,
though, I'll tell you that much.

03:03:38.276 --> 03:03:43.680
LIAM: Yeah, those things don't go away. You carry
that shit with you.

03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:53.670
TRAVIS: I was floating around, trying to find my
way to the Cerberus. I don't know if that's what I

03:03:53.670 --> 03:03:56.617
want to do anymore.

03:03:56.617 --> 03:04:00.549
MARISHA: What do you want to do?

03:04:00.549 --> 03:04:05.170
TRAVIS: I felt like I almost died and I hadn't
taken care of any of the shit that got me here in

03:04:05.170 --> 03:04:15.245
the first place. I was so worried about trying to
learn about these new abilities that-- I felt like

03:04:15.245 --> 03:04:26.909
I got distracted. I have people I want to find and
things I want to remedy.

03:04:26.909 --> 03:04:36.555
MARISHA: Yeah. How did Jester do? No offense, but
she seems like she's a little bit more willfully

03:04:36.555 --> 03:04:38.722
stronger than you are.

03:04:38.722 --> 03:04:42.939
TRAVIS: I mean, fuck, it's really disturbing.
Like, she came out of there like a little kettle

03:04:42.939 --> 03:04:49.074
of popcorn, just no problem. I mean-- Can I see
Jester? Is she nearby?

03:04:49.074 --> 03:04:52.138
MATT: Jester, are you nearby?

03:04:52.138 --> 03:04:57.064
LAURA: I'm across the bar just fucking dancing
alone.

03:04:57.064 --> 03:05:02.311
(laughter)

03:05:02.311 --> 03:05:04.304
LIAM: Just Sixteen Candles-ing it.

03:05:04.304 --> 03:05:05.118
MARISHA: Yep.

03:05:07.541 --> 03:05:14.096
TRAVIS: I was worried. There were really dark
times. I would hear Jester singing to herself at

03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:19.427
night and then she'd change lyrics, and then my
name would be in the lyrics sometimes. Every

03:05:19.427 --> 03:05:25.435
morning, she would try and cheer everybody up that
was around her, but she had the muffle? So I

03:05:25.435 --> 03:05:31.393
couldn't tell if my brain was playing tricks on
me, or if she was just-- I don't think there's

03:05:31.393 --> 03:05:37.254
much that gets her down. It's kind of inspiring.

03:05:37.254 --> 03:05:39.510
LIAM: I think it is an act.

03:05:39.510 --> 03:05:43.572
TRAVIS: An act?

03:05:44.512 --> 03:05:45.940
LIAM: I think it is an act.

03:05:45.940 --> 03:05:49.157
TRAVIS: It is kind of fucked that there's no music
right now, and she's just--

03:05:50.574 --> 03:05:54.353
MATT: Can't force the playlist.

03:05:54.353 --> 03:06:10.282
LIAM: No, she has a lot of-- she's an amazing
woman, but talent is different than happiness, I guess.

03:06:10.282 --> 03:06:12.875
MARISHA: I don't know, she looks fucking stoked to
me right now.

03:06:12.875 --> 03:06:14.216
LIAM: Well, she's very drunk.

03:06:14.216 --> 03:06:15.334
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:06:15.334 --> 03:06:17.766
LAURA: Nuh-uh.

03:06:17.766 --> 03:06:19.590
LIAM: Yeah.

03:06:19.590 --> 03:06:25.936
TALIESIN: I'm going to join this table. I've had
six drinks. I'm in the biggest city I've ever been

03:06:25.936 --> 03:06:34.374
in. Everything tastes terrible! I don't even know
what these last two are; they're just terrible!

03:06:34.374 --> 03:06:36.411
MARISHA: You don't drink it because it tastes
good.

03:06:36.411 --> 03:06:38.919
LIAM: Mr. Clay, have a seat. Drop a deuce.

03:06:38.919 --> 03:06:41.231
MARISHA: Eyy!

03:06:41.231 --> 03:06:45.036
TRAVIS: That was well placed.

03:06:45.036 --> 03:06:46.467
MARISHA: If it had to be anywhere.

03:06:46.467 --> 03:06:48.651
SAM: He's making fun of your name!

03:06:48.651 --> 03:06:51.539
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I've heard it before.

03:06:51.539 --> 03:06:55.384
LIAM: I mean, it's well-natured, though.

03:06:55.384 --> 03:06:56.193
SAM: Of course!

03:06:56.193 --> 03:07:02.100
TRAVIS: You've heard it before? Did you have a lot
of cemetery folks that were good for good-natured ribbing?

03:07:02.100 --> 03:07:06.466
TALIESIN: You'd be amazed at how people deal with
a grieving process. I mean, you're going through

03:07:06.466 --> 03:07:07.548
it right now.

03:07:07.548 --> 03:07:08.309
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:10.856
MARISHA: I go: (yelling) Jester! Nott!

03:07:10.856 --> 03:07:12.500
SAM: What?

03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:14.302
MARISHA: (yelling) Come sit down! Damn it!

03:07:14.302 --> 03:07:21.015
SAM: Okay! Have you not thrown up yet?

03:07:21.015 --> 03:07:23.518
TALIESIN: Is that part of-- are you supposed to?

03:07:23.518 --> 03:07:24.770
SAM: You will.

03:07:24.770 --> 03:07:27.773
TRAVIS: How's your face feel?

03:07:27.773 --> 03:07:31.442
TALIESIN: Normal face style, I suppose.

03:07:31.442 --> 03:07:33.682
MARISHA: Go like this, go: (trills)

03:07:33.682 --> 03:07:34.875
TALIESIN: (trills)

03:07:34.875 --> 03:07:36.323
MARISHA: Can you feel it? Can you feel that?

03:07:36.323 --> 03:07:37.589
TALIESIN: I can feel my lips doing that.

03:07:37.589 --> 03:07:38.858
TRAVIS: He's pretty tall. He's a big guy.

03:07:38.858 --> 03:07:40.076
SAM: It's a lot of weight.

03:07:40.076 --> 03:07:45.100
LIAM: You can't properly be part of civilization
until you've gotten shit-faced and thrown up.

03:07:45.100 --> 03:07:49.945
TRAVIS: Oh! You know what you're going to be good
for when it's cold? Fucking hot toddies.

03:07:49.945 --> 03:07:51.576
MARISHA: (gasps)

03:07:51.576 --> 03:07:54.140
TALIESIN: I've made a hot toddy before.

03:07:54.140 --> 03:07:58.092
TRAVIS: I bet you make a great hot toddy. Out of
some dead folks' feet.

03:07:58.092 --> 03:08:01.329
MARISHA: Oh, man.

03:08:01.329 --> 03:08:05.193
TALIESIN: Cinnamon lemon tea.

03:08:05.193 --> 03:08:10.744
LIAM: Bit of a little side conversation. I slap
down the rest of my Goldschläger.

03:08:10.744 --> 03:08:13.466
TALIESIN: Eww! God!

03:08:13.466 --> 03:08:17.902
MATT: Your Hpnotiq? Your Malibu?

03:08:17.902 --> 03:08:25.912
LIAM: No. You, have some more. You will dance
better, ja. You have just survived death!

03:08:25.912 --> 03:08:28.493
LAURA: I don't need any help to dance better! I
dance pretty good.

03:08:28.493 --> 03:08:37.389
LIAM: I understand that, but we are dancing along
the razor's edge of death, so, you know, I feel

03:08:37.389 --> 03:08:42.593
like you should embrace the morbidity of life.

03:08:42.593 --> 03:08:44.473
SAM: You don't have to drink it--

03:08:44.473 --> 03:08:45.713
LIAM: You definitely do not have to.

03:08:45.713 --> 03:08:46.841
MARISHA: No, you don't have to.

03:08:46.841 --> 03:08:48.113
LIAM: Definitely don't have to.

03:08:48.113 --> 03:08:49.685
MARISHA and LIAM: Not at all.

03:08:49.685 --> 03:08:52.080
LAURA: I feel like this is reverse psychology.

03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:55.185
LIAM: Don't drink it, whatever you do.

03:08:55.185 --> 03:08:58.860
LAURA: I don't know what I'm supposed to do now!

03:08:58.860 --> 03:09:00.830
LIAM: You are supposed to not drink that--

03:09:00.830 --> 03:09:02.719
SAM: Have you ever had liquor?

03:09:02.719 --> 03:09:03.673
LAURA: Yes, of course.

03:09:03.673 --> 03:09:05.428
SAM: Oh. Well, what happened?

03:09:05.428 --> 03:09:06.307
LIAM: Ja.

03:09:06.307 --> 03:09:09.520
LAURA: Well. I mean I had like--

03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:11.722
LIAM: Are we talking when you were a little girl
with the--?

03:09:11.722 --> 03:09:13.409
LAURA: There you go. Nothing happens!

03:09:13.409 --> 03:09:14.164
SAM: That's it?

03:09:14.164 --> 03:09:14.878
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:14.878 --> 03:09:16.953
SAM: I don't think-- no, she's never drunk.

03:09:16.953 --> 03:09:18.756
LIAM: I don't think so.

03:09:18.756 --> 03:09:20.717
SAM: Why not?

03:09:20.717 --> 03:09:22.623
LAURA: You know, milk is just so good.

03:09:22.623 --> 03:09:24.093
SAM: It is very good.

03:09:24.093 --> 03:09:26.593
TALIESIN: I don't know if I agree with that,
but--

03:09:26.593 --> 03:09:31.100
SAM: Is there a reason why you won't drink? Are
you afraid?

03:09:31.100 --> 03:09:34.589
LAURA: Afraid? I'm not afraid of anything!

03:09:34.589 --> 03:09:36.982
SAM: Wow, that's intense.

03:09:36.982 --> 03:09:41.389
LIAM: Look at her biceps, they're quite large.
There's no reason to be afraid of anything. Nevermind.

03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:42.711
LAURA: Look at these things!

03:09:42.711 --> 03:09:43.683
SAM: They're huge!

03:09:43.683 --> 03:09:47.464
LIAM: Do you know what, we are all just happy to
be alive. It was just the spirit of the moment. I

03:09:47.464 --> 03:09:49.025
don't mean to pressure you.

03:09:49.025 --> 03:09:51.937
TALIESIN: I would like to try something that
tastes good. That's what I would like to have.

03:09:51.937 --> 03:09:55.801
Should have just ordered that from the first
place, something that tastes good.

03:09:55.801 --> 03:10:02.482
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Mr. Clay, have you ever had a
doughnut?

03:10:02.482 --> 03:10:03.341
TALIESIN: No.

03:10:03.341 --> 03:10:04.992
LAURA: Have you ever had any pastries?

03:10:04.992 --> 03:10:09.140
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, I've made bread, but I
don't--

03:10:09.140 --> 03:10:11.515
LAURA: (gasps) You know where we should take him?

03:10:11.515 --> 03:10:15.193
MARISHA: That one place right next to the smut
shop that had the really good doughnuts?

03:10:15.193 --> 03:10:17.229
TALIESIN: What's a smut shop?

03:10:17.229 --> 03:10:21.568
TRAVIS: (singing) Oh, life is going to unfold in
front of you!

03:10:21.568 --> 03:10:26.524
LAURA: I feel like we should go to the bathhouse.
That's where Molly would want us to go.

03:10:26.524 --> 03:10:28.150
MARISHA: Molly would want us to go to the
bathhouse.

03:10:28.150 --> 03:10:33.759
LIAM: You know, hold on a second. Grab your milk.
Everybody raise a glass.

03:10:33.759 --> 03:10:35.650
LAURA and MARISHA: (singing) To freedom!

03:10:35.650 --> 03:10:36.681
LIAM: No.

03:10:36.681 --> 03:10:41.125
(laughter)

03:10:41.125 --> 03:10:45.678
LIAM: Oh. To that purple devil. To Mollymauk
Tealeaf.

03:10:45.678 --> 03:10:46.725
MARISHA: To the Tealeaf.

03:10:46.725 --> 03:10:48.957
TRAVIS: Hear, hear.

03:10:48.957 --> 03:10:55.987
MARISHA: Now to our new Tealeaf.

03:10:55.987 --> 03:10:58.192
TALIESIN: (laughs) That's funny.

03:10:58.192 --> 03:10:59.136
LIAM: That's ironic.

03:10:59.136 --> 03:11:01.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.

03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:08.151
TALIESIN: Purely coincidental. Really, purely
coincidental.

03:11:08.151 --> 03:11:12.349
TRAVIS: Oh, definitely the bathhouse and Pumat,
right?

03:11:12.349 --> 03:11:13.611
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

03:11:13.611 --> 03:11:17.925
TRAVIS: It's been like a month. He's got to have
some cool shit.

03:11:17.925 --> 03:11:19.994
LIAM: Fjord, you want to go shopping this week,
yeah?

03:11:19.994 --> 03:11:21.405
TRAVIS: Sure. (sniffs)

03:11:21.405 --> 03:11:26.546
(laughter)

03:11:26.546 --> 03:11:28.772
SAM: He's very drunk. Must be drunk.

03:11:28.772 --> 03:11:33.787
LIAM: What would you like? What kind of swords
would you like to eat this week? Would you like to

03:11:33.787 --> 03:11:41.828
eat like a sai? Like, you know, like Raphael's
weapon? Or would you like to have, maybe--

03:11:41.828 --> 03:11:44.472
TRAVIS: Raphael, the mason?

03:11:44.472 --> 03:11:45.390
SAM: The tortle!

03:11:45.390 --> 03:11:47.375
LIAM: He's a bard from--

03:11:47.375 --> 03:11:50.180
MARISHA: You talking about experimenting with how
many weapons we can see--

03:11:50.180 --> 03:11:53.533
LIAM: Yeah, what could we put into his mouth? This
is all out of character, I don't know any of this

03:11:53.533 --> 03:11:58.269
stuff, but I would like to talk to Travis about
swallowing whole, long swords.

03:11:58.269 --> 03:12:02.410
TRAVIS: I didn't really swallow the last one. It
just kind of absorbed.

03:12:02.410 --> 03:12:04.508
LIAM: Yeah, keep telling yourself that, big guy.

03:12:04.508 --> 03:12:10.345
MARISHA: So here's my question. If we don't turn
in the crystal eyeball--

03:12:10.345 --> 03:12:12.515
TALIESIN and MARISHA: cloven crystal.

03:12:12.515 --> 03:12:13.773
LIAM: Fuckable cantaloupe.

03:12:13.773 --> 03:12:20.836
MARISHA: If we don't have that, does that mean
bounty hunters are going to come after you?

03:12:20.836 --> 03:12:26.798
LAURA: No, no, they would come after Ionos. Lonos.
Jonas. I'm not sure.

03:12:26.798 --> 03:12:27.583
MATT: It's Ionos.

03:12:27.583 --> 03:12:28.366
SAM: Ionos?

03:12:28.366 --> 03:12:29.873
TRAVIS: Jonos!

03:12:29.873 --> 03:12:32.548
LAURA: It's a special "I" on there. I can't tell.

03:12:32.548 --> 03:12:39.033
LIAM: May I have a look at that? Oh, Keen Mind.

03:12:39.430 --> 03:12:45.052
MATT: There you go. You have to delete that in 30
days.

03:12:45.903 --> 03:12:50.396
TRAVIS: No, nobody knows about its current
origins. We just know who was looking for it and

03:12:50.396 --> 03:12:51.889
who it was supposed to go to.

03:12:51.889 --> 03:12:55.152
SAM: Did you notice The Gentleman's face when you
mentioned that name?

03:12:55.152 --> 03:12:56.960
TRAVIS: Yeah?

03:12:56.960 --> 03:13:00.108
SAM: He looked over at Ophelia. It was very
suspicious.

03:13:00.108 --> 03:13:02.275
TRAVIS: Yeah, I thought that was just the
bone-dogging look.

03:13:02.275 --> 03:13:07.742
SAM: No, you have to pick up on the subtleties of
the human expression to get this stuff. Jester and

03:13:07.742 --> 03:13:10.537
I saw it. It was definitely suspicious.

03:13:10.537 --> 03:13:12.433
LIAM: Yeah, he started sweating out of
nervousness.

03:13:12.433 --> 03:13:21.195
SAM: He did! Very good, Caleb! It's a tell, is
what it is.

03:13:21.195 --> 03:13:25.272
LAURA: We should see if he knows the name
Evantica.

03:13:25.272 --> 03:13:27.389
SAM: I think I'll go mention it to The Gentleman.

03:13:27.389 --> 03:13:28.476
LAURA: But just say it like--

03:13:28.476 --> 03:13:29.116
SAM: In passing!

03:13:29.116 --> 03:13:33.047
LAURA: Yeah, don't make it obvious. It's a casual
sort of name.

03:13:33.047 --> 03:13:34.797
SAM: Is he still in the bar?

03:13:34.797 --> 03:13:38.175
MATT: He's in the bar. He's actually near the
stairs. At this point, the two drivers have

03:13:38.175 --> 03:13:43.281
brought down all the handbags for Ophelia and have
placed them in a pile at the base of it.

03:13:43.281 --> 03:13:44.682
TRAVIS: Matching Gucci luggage?

03:13:44.682 --> 03:13:50.387
MATT: Yeah. It looks like she's shacking up in the
Underworks for a little bit while they

03:13:50.387 --> 03:13:58.099
re-establish this trade route. So they're in a bit
of conversation, flirtatiously. He seems-- it's

03:13:58.099 --> 03:14:04.842
like a subtle Pepe le Pew scenario, where he's
definitely laying it on a bit thick and she's

03:14:04.842 --> 03:14:09.092
being very dodgy and playful, but, you know.

03:14:09.092 --> 03:14:10.783
TALIESIN: "Establishing trade routes."

03:14:10.783 --> 03:14:13.133
MARISHA: Do we see this? Do we see this
happening?

03:14:13.133 --> 03:14:14.439
MATT: You can see it at a distance, yeah.

03:14:14.439 --> 03:14:17.125
MARISHA: She's totally flirting with him just to
get the goods.

03:14:17.125 --> 03:14:18.102
LIAM: You think so?

03:14:18.102 --> 03:14:22.855
MARISHA: Oh, yeah! She doesn't actually, like,
want this, she just wants to maintain a good relationship.

03:14:22.855 --> 03:14:25.090
LIAM: He is laying it on thick.

03:14:25.090 --> 03:14:30.423
MARISHA: Yep. Look, she's like, "Mmm, please stop
touching me."

03:14:30.423 --> 03:14:35.225
LIAM: Well, I will trust you, because you are--
I'm going to quit while I'm ahead.

03:14:35.225 --> 03:14:40.209
TRAVIS: That was a good bail-out.

03:14:40.209 --> 03:14:40.991
MARISHA: Hey, Caleb.

03:14:40.991 --> 03:14:42.505
LIAM: Yeah?

03:14:42.505 --> 03:14:49.355
MARISHA: You're a good friend. Please don't ever
ask me about my sex life.

03:14:49.355 --> 03:14:58.643
LIAM: I say this with the utmost gravity. I have
no interest in your sex life. Do you believe me?

03:14:58.643 --> 03:15:01.350
Insight check me.

03:15:01.350 --> 03:15:04.854
LAURA: What's an insight check?

03:15:04.854 --> 03:15:08.473
MARISHA: I only have gold; I don't have checks.

03:15:08.473 --> 03:15:13.429
LIAM: (sighs) You're a good friend.

03:15:13.429 --> 03:15:17.164
SAM: Let's get out of this place.

03:15:17.164 --> 03:15:24.364
TRAVIS: Aren't you going to yell the name out?
(shouting) Antigua! Antigua!

03:15:24.364 --> 03:15:25.931
SAM and LAURA: That's not the name.

03:15:25.931 --> 03:15:27.223
SAM: That's an island.

03:15:27.223 --> 03:15:32.678
LIAM: We're going to Florida!

03:15:32.678 --> 03:15:35.065
TRAVIS: Did it work?

03:15:35.065 --> 03:15:37.539
SAM: No, I don't think that would do it.

03:15:37.539 --> 03:15:42.974
LIAM: Every 50th episode, Critical Role has to
have a drunken bar night. It's in a contract somewhere.

03:15:42.974 --> 03:15:46.297
MATT: I think it is, yeah. It's in our own
internal friend contract.

03:15:46.297 --> 03:15:48.117
TALIESIN: Pub crawl? Pub crawl?

03:15:48.117 --> 03:15:50.656
LAURA: Go, go, go!

03:15:50.656 --> 03:15:55.662
SAM: Okay, I'm going to stumble over to The
Gentleman, and say: I think we're going to head

03:15:55.662 --> 03:16:00.423
out now, but if you need us, we'll probably be at
The Leaky Tap or something.

03:16:00.423 --> 03:16:04.449
MATT: "Oh, that's fine. You know where to find me
if you need anything as well."

03:16:04.449 --> 03:16:11.493
SAM: Sure, sure. We've been summoned by this
person named Evantica, so we're probably going to go find--

03:16:11.493 --> 03:16:14.355
MATT: "All right. Well, if there's anything you
require from me, let me know."

03:16:14.355 --> 03:16:18.847
SAM: Okay. You don't know where she is in town?

03:16:18.847 --> 03:16:20.823
MATT: "Can't say I do."

03:16:20.823 --> 03:16:23.110
SAM: Or he? I'm not really sure.

03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:25.220
MATT: "No."

03:16:25.220 --> 03:16:28.955
SAM: Okay. Cool, cool, cool.

03:16:28.955 --> 03:16:32.740
LAURA: (whispering) Can you insight check him?

03:16:32.740 --> 03:16:43.616
SAM: Well, off we go! Oh, Jester! Don't forget!
We're going to talk about the Captain later!

03:16:43.616 --> 03:16:47.852
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:16:47.852 --> 03:16:54.165
MATT: He's already talking to Ophelia. He isn't
paying attention. He's now having various members

03:16:54.165 --> 03:16:57.556
of his troupe pick up her bags for her and move
her into one of the other chambers.

03:16:57.556 --> 03:17:00.549
LAURA: I was insight checking him while Nott was
talking to him.

03:17:00.549 --> 03:17:03.770
MATT: Make an insight check.

03:17:03.770 --> 03:17:05.124
LIAM: Come on.

03:17:05.124 --> 03:17:09.299
LAURA: No. 12.

03:17:09.299 --> 03:17:13.560
MATT: At this distance, you can't even see his
face, unfortunately, so it's hard. You're seeing

03:17:13.560 --> 03:17:18.744
body movement a little bit, but his gestures seem
to be in line with classic Gentleman.

03:17:18.744 --> 03:17:23.747
LAURA: I feel like his hands moved a little bit
more, but I can't tell for sure. There was

03:17:23.747 --> 03:17:30.353
tension! There was tension in his fist. Right
here, I saw.

03:17:30.353 --> 03:17:39.460
SAM: Yeah. I couldn't focus because there was so
much dripping going on. It's a mask of water. It's disgusting.

03:17:39.460 --> 03:17:41.578
LAURA: I kind of like it. I think it looks cool.

03:17:41.578 --> 03:17:44.984
TALIESIN: How do you make a non-tense fist? I'm
trying to--

03:17:44.984 --> 03:17:48.096
LAURA: Like this. Well, you know--

03:17:48.096 --> 03:17:50.603
SAM: No, no.

03:17:50.603 --> 03:17:55.953
TRAVIS: Keep going! Follow that thread! Pull on
that string!

03:17:55.953 --> 03:18:00.958
LIAM: Be like water.

03:18:00.958 --> 03:18:04.543
SAM: All right, let's get the fuck out of here!

03:18:04.543 --> 03:18:08.173
TRAVIS: Super hammered, we stumble out.

03:18:08.173 --> 03:18:15.724
MATT: You guys stumble your way out of The Evening
Nip, back into the streets of Zadash, to find your

03:18:15.724 --> 03:18:27.628
fortune, to enjoy the fruits of your labor, and,
the best way you can, maintain the memory of a man

03:18:27.628 --> 03:18:33.983
who lived life to its fullest. A man, a woman, a
they-- to the fullest.

03:18:33.983 --> 03:18:39.669
MARISHA: I light a few cherry bombs and throw them
at my friends in celebration.

03:18:39.669 --> 03:18:42.100
TRAVIS: You have cherry bombs? The fuck those come
from?!

03:18:42.100 --> 03:18:45.583
MATT: Fireworks are going off in the center of the
street. (popping)

03:18:45.583 --> 03:18:47.062
MARISHA: For Molly!

03:18:47.062 --> 03:18:50.727
MATT: Some horses freak out, and some carts get
dragged down at a fast pace down the road.

03:18:50.727 --> 03:18:54.545
LIAM: Yeah, I drunkenly form the Goblight!

03:18:54.545 --> 03:19:05.070
SAM: Oh! (vocalizing) My whole body starts glowing
with the light. You set me on fire!

03:19:05.070 --> 03:19:07.554
MARISHA: (shouting) It's all for Molly!

03:19:07.554 --> 03:19:10.245
MATT: A confusing display follows you.

03:19:10.245 --> 03:19:12.389
TALIESIN: I've made a terrible mistake.

03:19:12.389 --> 03:19:16.511
MATT: Heading towards the Pentamarket. That's
where we'll pick up next week.

03:19:16.511 --> 03:19:20.033
LIAM: Caduceus Clay! We are your destiny!

03:19:20.033 --> 03:19:24.570
TALIESIN: Oh no. This is a lot.

03:19:24.570 --> 03:19:28.228
MATT: We'll pick up on that next Thursday. You
guys will have some downtime! We'll have a couple

03:19:28.228 --> 03:19:33.401
weeks of game downtime for your characters, if
there's anything you want to accomplish.

03:19:33.401 --> 03:19:34.570
LIAM: I'm going to do so much!

03:19:34.570 --> 03:19:35.786
SAM: Do we tell you now, or later?

03:19:35.786 --> 03:19:38.982
MATT: Think about it over the next week, and the
beginning of the next episode, we'll discuss what

03:19:38.982 --> 03:19:42.569
it is you want to accomplish, and we might have a
few momentary role play moments depending on what

03:19:42.569 --> 03:19:49.446
it is you want to do. That involves contacts,
purchases, research, looking for information,

03:19:49.446 --> 03:19:54.061
anything you want to do specific to your
character. Start thinking about that throughout the week.

03:19:54.061 --> 03:19:59.221
SAM: Money-wise, we each get 964 more gold.

03:19:59.221 --> 03:20:02.591
LAURA: Can we make that platinum? Because most of
that is platinum. What would that be?

03:20:02.591 --> 03:20:05.576
SAM: 964 each.

03:20:05.576 --> 03:20:08.721
MATT: That's 96 platinum and four gold.

03:20:08.721 --> 03:20:16.133
LIAM: Oh, man, that's great. All my spell books
and scrolls will be converted in the next week!

03:20:16.133 --> 03:20:29.342
Huzzah! Are you sure we can't play for another
seven hours tonight? Just this once? Just one

03:20:29.342 --> 03:20:31.986
ten-hour Critical Role episode?

03:20:31.986 --> 03:20:34.645
LAURA: Do you remember that tavern called The
Leaky Nip?

03:20:34.645 --> 03:20:42.445
TALIESIN: Wow. Have you been sitting on that all
night? Because that was amazing.

03:20:42.445 --> 03:20:49.048
MATT: If I didn't have a 9:00am call time in Santa
Monica tomorrow, I would be totally down for it.

03:20:49.048 --> 03:20:50.611
LIAM: So you're saying there's a chance.

03:20:50.611 --> 03:20:55.875
MATT: Yes. No, I'm good. Anyway, thank you guys.

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.303
MATT: Hello everyone,

00:00:01.303 --> 00:00:03.110
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.340
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.855
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:09.630
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.150
MATT: Before--

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.880
before we jump into-- why is it every episode?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.280
And it's still the most ridiculous thing.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.670
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.810
we have some announcements to get through

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.130
beginning with the first of our two sponsors,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.300
Ravensburger, Sam.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.947
SAM: We love Ravensburger so much--

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:29.570
(laughter)

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.660
that we've almost learned how to say their name.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.630
But no matter how you say it,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.020
their new game Wonder Woman: Challenge of the Amazons

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.150
is a must have.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.490
The Amazon tribe of warriors have lived in peace

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.400
for centuries on Themyscira.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.593
I think that's how you say that.
TRAVIS: It is.

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:46.258
SAM: But now enemies have invaded and it's up to you

00:00:46.258 --> 00:00:48.040
to defend the island against Ares,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.530
the Cheetah, or Circe.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.800
To celebrate their new game, Ravensburger, maybe,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.800
sent me Wonder Woman's actual golden Lariat of Truth.

00:00:58.104 --> 00:01:00.050
ASHLEY: What?!
SAM: Amazing. Yeah.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.250
And tonight, I'm going to see if it works.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.290
Get ready, Ash.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.123
ASHLEY: Oh!

00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:06.375
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:08.320
(laughter)

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.807
ASHLEY: Phew, I'm so glad it didn't work.

00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:12.287
SAM: (grunts)

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:13.234
(cheering)

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:15.920
ASHLEY: Oh no, please no.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.502
Don't do it.

00:01:17.502 --> 00:01:18.800
SAM: Okay!

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.633
LAURA: Oh god.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:22.130
SAM: Ashley is now-- oh boy.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.703
You okay, over there?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:26.880
SAM: Stunts! Ashley is now in a trance of truth.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.380
Everything she says must be the truth.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.740
Let's test it out with an easy one.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.530
Ashley, please state your name.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.010
ASHLEY: Ashley Marsupial Bernadette Russell Crowe

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.100
Von Chex Mix W Johnson the 24th.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.450
SAM: Very truthful; it works.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.860
All right, Ashley,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.480
tell me about the new Wonder Woman game.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.360
ASHLEY: It's a cooperative game for two to five players.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
Where are you strategize, face foes,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.800
and rise to meet the challenge of the Amazons together.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.633
SAM: Very truthful indeed.

00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:03.530
Now for a little fun.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.410
Okay, let's play some Kiss, Marry, Kill.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.360
Between Brian Foster, Laura Bailey, and Matt Mercer.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.660
Who would you rather kiss?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.800
Who would you rather marry?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.300
And who would you rather kill?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.260
ASHLEY: Kiss Laura Bailey,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.670
marry Brian W. Foster,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.153
kill Sam Riegel.

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:24.345
SAM: Oh.
TALIESIN: Harsh, but fair.

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:25.890
SAM: Okay, that was not one of the options

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.060
so that's weird.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.230
Let's just try it again.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.650
Kiss, Marry, Kill: Marisha, Liam, and Taliesin in this time.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.000
ASHLEY: Kill Sam Riegel,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.100
drive the body to the
Brown Mountain Dam in the Angeles Forest,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.640
dump it in the creek behind the dam

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.000
because no one ever looks there.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.957
SAM: Okay, okay, we're going to stop that right now.

00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:42.870
(laughter)

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.510
Yeah, maybe we should just wrap it up.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.080
The game includes five paintable Amazon miniatures,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.710
including Diana and is available

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.550
where games are sold in the US.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.990
Enter for your chance to win the game

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.680
at @RavenburgerNA on Twitter.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.010
They're giving away 10 copies right now,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.000
or buy yours at bit.ly/WWChallengeOfTheAmazons

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.230
and thanks to Ravensburger.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.648
Back to you, Matt.

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:08.451
MATT: Thank you Sam and thank you, Ravensburger--

00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:10.170
TRAVIS: Sam shared that info.
MATT: -- for supporting.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.003
Yeah, of course.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.900
Second sponsor tonight, our returning friends

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.744
since the beginning of this campaign at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:18.130
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪
(cheering)

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.960
MATT: They actually just launched their new character app,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.030
which is pretty rad.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.890
It gives you the chance to track your characters

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.600
from the palm of your hand, wherever you are.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.770
It's on the phone now,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.480
which is really, really fricking useful, actually.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.210
All your character stats, spell slots, equipment,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.440
everything else about your character

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.590
is now editable within the app character sheet.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.390
And it's always being updated with new features,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.554
which is awesome.

00:03:38.554 --> 00:03:40.178
You can get it now for Android or Apple

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:45.060
and check out more at dndbeyond.link/CRapp.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.600
SAM: Wait, C R app?

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.117
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Does that spell crap?

00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:53.309
MARISHA: It totally does.

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.136
MATT: Yes, it does.

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:56.804
MARISHA: It's crahp.

00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:58.012
MATT and LAURA: Crahp.

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:00.858
SAM: My hat's off to you, D&amp;D Beyond,

00:04:00.858 --> 00:04:02.821
that was an excellent trolling of us.

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:03.689
MATT: Yes.

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.510
(laughter)

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.343
ASHLEY: Grand.

00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:08.970
MATT: It's pretty great.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.515
Marisha, you had some announcements.

00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:12.800
MARISHA: Yes.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.730
Join us on Twitch on Tuesday,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.730
August 4th at 4:00pm Pacific

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:24.263
for Mini Primetime After Dark,

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.430
which is a special one-off that we created

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.860
with all of the mini painting footage

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.730
from when we were making Mini Primetime,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.330
because we shot all those minis in their entirety.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.540
It's actually something that we wanted to do

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.760
a really long time ago.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.700
But now thanks to quarantine,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.880
we had time to put it together.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.180
Yeah, it's super chill vibes,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.170
mini painting, eye candy.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.220
And, of course, the VOD will be available on YouTube

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.959
the following Thursday.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.685
(laughter)

00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:55.561
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.970
MARISHA: Yeah, I did it.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.018
MATT: I believe, oh!

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:03.660
I believe those are all the announcements

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.493
we have tonight.

00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:05.326
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, no big deal.

00:05:05.326 --> 00:05:07.870
MATT: So let's go ahead and jump into

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.286
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:13.510

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.601

MATT: Welcome back.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.262
So.

00:06:52.262 --> 00:06:53.645
Last we left off:

00:06:53.645 --> 00:06:55.970
The Mighty Nein, upon arriving in Rumblecusp

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.715
in hopes of setting up Traveler Con in the next week or so.

00:07:00.715 --> 00:07:02.595
You've met some individuals.

00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:04.330
You've discovered that the people that

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.934
already exist here on the island have

00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:09.637
lost their memories, it seems, and have come to enjoy

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.955
a rather simple life here in the village of Vo

00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:15.934
in the shadow of some sort of a fire god

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:17.769
known as Vokodo.

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.588
You, with the help of one of their druidic

00:07:20.588 --> 00:07:24.013
spiritual leaders, traveled to meet with this Vokodo,

00:07:24.013 --> 00:07:26.346
and seemed to have suspicions that it's not a god,

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:28.129
but some sort of,

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:29.978
malicious entity that is itself

00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:31.663
affecting and controlling this island,

00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:34.942
robbing memories and requiring those that live here

00:07:34.942 --> 00:07:38.500
to bring all their goods and precious things

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.785
as gifts, to mine from the island

00:07:40.785 --> 00:07:43.502
and gift everything to this entity.

00:07:43.502 --> 00:07:45.502
You managed to make your way out

00:07:45.502 --> 00:07:47.544
after making some offerings to it.

00:07:47.544 --> 00:07:49.281
(coughs) Pardon me.

00:07:50.464 --> 00:07:52.980
Through the use of a Greater Restoration spell,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.350
returned the memories of the druid leader

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.360
that you had traveling with you,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.200
discovering that they were named Vilya,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.440
apparently from another continent

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.782
known as Tal'Dorei.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.940
You then, together as a team,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.940
transformed some of you into birds

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.958
and began to fly across the island for faster and

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.390
mostly safer travel.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.000
Making your way towards the eastern side,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.370
where the Heaven's Falls exist.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.000
A little bit of a bumpy landing, but nevertheless,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.960
you found yourselves searching the exterior of these falls

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.970
and coming to a night's rest.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.460
The next morning, some of you did begin to lose your memory,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.440
but after cleansing these with spells,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.860
you began to inspect the falls.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.690
Some pearls were found, some accidents were had.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.510
But after briefly separating the falls themselves

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.267
and discovering the illusion behind it

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:48.750
you found a cavern which held numerous,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.750
numerous boats and ships from all different ages

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.030
there, crowded and left in the shadows.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.980
As you began to inspect the interior of this cavern

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.810
Fjord, you noticed what looked to be the entrance to

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.840
a torchbloom-covered

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.300
subterranean water tunnel.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.890
Caduceus, you went to inspect it

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.530
and found yourself suddenly

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.090
affected by some sort of strange compulsion

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.580
to find out what's at the end of these tunnels.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.770
TALIESIN: I remember.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.209
MATT: You began swimming feverishly into it.

00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:27.260
(laughter)

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.540
Fjord, you attempted to stop him

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.758
through multiple grapples and spells thrown.

00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:33.591
TRAVIS: I really tried.

00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:36.340
MATT: You were left blinded and kicked backward

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.328
as Caduceus thus has vanished from your grasp,

00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:41.090
eyes left to darkness.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.740
As you swam to the surface and shouted for aid--

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.990
TRAVIS: In a super macho voice.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.240
MATT: Yeah, straight up.
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Help!

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.540
MATT: The rest of you guys,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.580
hearing this, gather towards Fjord to discover

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.630
how best to deal with the recently

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.330
vanished Caduceus.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.750
And that is where we left off.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.420
So as you all now begin to make your way towards Fjord,

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.587
what are you doing?

00:10:05.587 --> 00:10:08.758
LAURA: What's going on, what's happening, Fjord?

00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:10.748
TRAVIS: Oh, did we not establish that
at the end of the last game?

00:10:10.748 --> 00:10:12.106
SAM: I don't think so.

00:10:12.106 --> 00:10:13.930
TRAVIS: Caduceus was, seems like he was compelled.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.720
He just kept swimming towards the creature.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.930
I think it's what happened last time.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.050
We have to go after him!

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.580
LAURA: Oh no, so he's out there by himself!

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.940
LIAM: The way, point the way.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.090
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay, okay, so.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.370
LAURA: You're not blind any more, right?

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.360
TRAVIS: No, I can see.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.350
Somebody made me not,

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.409
somebody made me not blind.

00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:31.444
MARISHA: Holy shit.

00:10:31.444 --> 00:10:32.640
TRAVIS: ♪ Somebody made me not blind. ♪

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.860
LAURA: I think Vilya made him not blind.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.160
Vilya made him not blind.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.410
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Yes, okay.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.050
TRAVIS: You have fast monk shit, right?

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:40.883
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:10:40.883 --> 00:10:43.120
TRAVIS: Okay, you have fast wizard shit.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.160
LIAM: In a pinch, <i>ja</i>.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.190
TRAVIS: Okay, so in the water, who has the fastest speeds?

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.000
Because we should send like

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.210
two people after him.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.292
LAURA: I can cast Freedom of Movement.

00:10:52.292 --> 00:10:53.510
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure--
SAM: What does that mean, what does that do?

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.120
TRAVIS: What does that make your max speed in the water?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.840
LAURA: Hold on, let me get to my spells.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.170
MARISHA: And then you can cast--

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.090
LAURA: Freedom of Movement, I can cast on--

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.908
MARISHA: Uh huh, uh huh.
LIAM: He's going.

00:11:02.908 --> 00:11:04.740
MATT: Yeah, I'm taking this away as we're--

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.013
LAURA: Oh god, go!

00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:08.310
LIAM: Let's just retreat. And I'm swimming--

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.230
MARISHA: How many times can you do that?

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.988
LIAM: -- towards the direction--

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.870
LAURA: I'm just going to cast
it on you, Freedom of Movement.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.280
SAM: What does it do, what does it do?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.290
LIAM: I can only do it once it's concentration.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.300
LAURA: No, it's not.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.133
LIAM: No, me.

00:11:20.133 --> 00:11:21.680
MATT: Okay.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.513
MARISHA: She's swimming already!

00:11:22.513 --> 00:11:23.980
LAURA: You get no penalty for water.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.580
MARISHA: No penalty movement.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.128
Move, action to move.

00:11:28.128 --> 00:11:29.450
Step of the Wind.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.130
MATT: Okay, so first,

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.660
so you cast the spell.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.530
While you are swimming.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.140
You feel suddenly the resistance of the water give way

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.090
and it is just like pushing through air.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.690
However, you're able to grab handholds almost

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.390
as you swim forward. It's odd,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.090
and you just begin coasting through
the water without resistance.

00:11:50.217 --> 00:11:51.050
So that takes away there,

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.540
you were casting Expeditious Retreat.
LIAM: Expeditious Retreat, yeah.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.011
MATT: Okay.

00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:55.240
You have been moving double movement

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.180
this whole time, heading through the tunnels,

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.260
which at this point puts you at

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.643
120.

00:12:04.983 --> 00:12:06.130
So you guys get within--

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.570
both of you are giving chase here?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.020
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.310
MATT: Okay.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.830
SAM: Fjord, you're not?

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.400
TRAVIS: I thought we all talked about deciding

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.470
who had the fastest speed,

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.730
but we're just doing shit, I guess.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.640
LAURA: Well, she has a lot of speed.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.476
TRAVIS: So have fun.

00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:23.561
(laughter)

00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:24.607
LAURA: He's ticking down the clock!

00:12:24.607 --> 00:12:25.515
We don't have time to talk!

00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:27.192
TRAVIS: Sure.
TALIESIN: Been fun.

00:12:27.192 --> 00:12:28.355
SAM: Fjord, are you going to go in after them?

00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:30.488
TRAVIS: No. These fucking yahoos could go.

00:12:32.025 --> 00:12:32.858
It's cool.

00:12:32.858 --> 00:12:34.912
SAM: They can't even see the dark, they're humans.

00:12:36.277 --> 00:12:37.168
LAURA: She can see.
TRAVIS: I was trying to--

00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:38.226
MARISHA: I can see.
TRAVIS: -- talk stuff out,

00:12:38.226 --> 00:12:39.340
but let's just shoot.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.000
LAURA: He said he was counting our clock.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.570
LIAM: Aren't the plants phosphorescent?

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.480
MATT: They are.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.820
It's easy to see once you go beneath the surface.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.008
Which you can see, though, it is dark beneath here.

00:12:52.008 --> 00:12:53.532
TRAVIS: Enjoy my cookie.

00:12:53.532 --> 00:12:55.880
(laughter)

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.020
MARISHA: I am trucking, I am going.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.240
MATT: All right, so how fast can you go in one round?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.230
MARISHA: 150 feet.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.740
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Damn.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.789
SAM: Whoa.
MATT: Monks.

00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:07.030
LAURA: Yeah, because I cast Freedom of Movement.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.143
So she gets no water penalty.
MARISHA: I get no penalties.

00:13:09.143 --> 00:13:09.976
MATT: So you are--

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:10.809
LIAM: I can do 90,

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:12.220
but that's halved and I don't have Freedom of Movement.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.053
MATT: Right, so 45.

00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:14.540
So you're trailing a little bit behind.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.373
LIAM: Oh yeah.

00:13:15.373 --> 00:13:17.040
MATT: But you will be catching up.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.453
Okay.

00:13:21.866 --> 00:13:22.960
And everyone else is staying behind?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.250
LAURA: We're going to swim up, but not get close.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.710
I don't want to get within the range

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:27.543
that we got before.

00:13:27.543 --> 00:13:28.750
MATT: Okay, so the rest of you guys keep

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.810
an exterior radius?

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.400
LIAM: And my goal, I don't know what the tunnels look like,

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.810
but if it's a straight shot and I could see a long way,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.950
I'm not going to go in.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.370
If it winds away and I can't see past the bend,

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.203
I guess I'll--

00:13:40.203 --> 00:13:41.036
MATT: It's a little windy.

00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:42.740
Like, you can't-- it's not like this

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.600
continuous straight tunnel.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.150
LIAM: So we don't, okay.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.940
SAM: I mean, someone should go in after them,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.070
in case they both get mind controlled

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.140
like Caduceus, right?

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.640
MARISHA: If you save from it,
because I've saved from it before,

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.830
do I have to save from it again?

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.139
MATT: Yes, you do.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:58.710
MATT: So the two people that are going into that space,

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.800
which would be Caleb and Beauregard,

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.480
I need you both to make a wisdom saving throws, please.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.540
MARISHA: All right, come on.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.850
TRAVIS: We had a whole text thread about this.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.683
MARISHA: Come on.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.800
LAURA: Then go.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.716
MARISHA: I don't want to fuck this up.

00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:10.263
SAM: I think you should go.

00:14:10.263 --> 00:14:11.263
TRAVIS: Oh, that wasn't the point,

00:14:11.263 --> 00:14:12.570
the point is to limit the number of people

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.086
going after him.
LAURA: That's what we were doing.

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.680
TRAVIS: Just two people, yeah.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.540
TRAVIS: But you're the only person
that can help any of them.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.240
LAURA: And everybody said I should stay back.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.307
I'm staying back.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.150
SAM: Jester, you should go.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.050
LIAM: 17.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.050
MATT: 17, okay.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:25.940
SAM: Let's change the plan,

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.930
let's change the plan.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.260
MARISHA: 22.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.990
MATT: Okay, both of you guys feel this strange

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.140
wave of influence pass over your mind

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.440
and you push forward.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.050
It does not take hold or effect.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.734
MARISHA: Fuck you, blooms, fuck you!

00:14:40.734 --> 00:14:42.963
SAM: Fuck you, Steve Blum.

00:14:42.963 --> 00:14:44.220
MARISHA: No, I love you, Steve Blum,

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.040
but fuck you, torchblooms.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.550
MARISHA: So you get about 80 feet in there

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.380
and you see it split into two different directions.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.250
You do not have sight on Caduceus.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.160
You're catching up now,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.100
you're a little ways into the tunnel.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.270
Caduceus does move ahead.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.390
MARISHA: Fjord, Fjord, which way?

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.739
LIAM: We're so far away from him.

00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:02.340
MARISHA: I go to the left.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.550
MATT: I mean, he can hear you because it is water,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.100
but it's very

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.440
difficult to make out the language

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.164
at this distance necessarily.
LAURA: Call for Caduceus!

00:15:10.164 --> 00:15:12.750
MARISHA: (yelling) Caduceus!

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.920
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check for me.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.920
MARISHA: Shit, balls, tits.
LIAM: Went left, though, right?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.090
LAURA: Well, depending.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.790
MARISHA: Natural 20!

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.650
MATT: Which is a total of?

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.810
MARISHA: Natural roll 20, 24.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.935
MATT: Some good rolls.
MARISHA: Best <i>Buy</i>!

00:15:26.935 --> 00:15:29.030
MATT: Paying attention, you look

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.480
at the two different paths in front of you

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.950
and you can see the torchblooms on the right hand side

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.010
are swaying slightly, like the recent water

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.918
has been disturbed.
MARISHA: Okay, okay,

00:15:36.918 --> 00:15:37.751
I'll head to the right, the right.

00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:40.440
MATT: So you go ahead and follow that side.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.957
TALIESIN: Dragon Slayer shit right here.

00:15:42.957 --> 00:15:45.980
MATT: You are just swimming as hard as you can

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.100
without noticing Beauregard quickly enough,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.283
because you can with the aid of that spell--

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.333
MARISHA: Thank you, Jessie.
MATT: -- immediately curve up and over

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:55.920
and you can see Caduceus up ahead.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.710
You can catch up without issue.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.950
You have gotten a little ways in.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.910
You reach that same intersection.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:02.970
LIAM: Do I see her?

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.610
MATT: I would say you--

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.910
you're far enough away from her where you can just

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.410
catch enough of her shift as she exits that space.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.320
So you do--

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.670
you are able to follow the path that she's taking.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.760
So Beauregard,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.740
you manage to catch up to Caduceus.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.200
What are you doing?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.170
MARISHA: Caduceus?

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.370
TALIESIN: Hey!

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.853
MARISHA: Whack!
TALIESIN: (exclaims)

00:16:22.853 --> 00:16:25.310
MARISHA: I'm cracking him over the head, Stunning Strike.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.100
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll an attack.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.060
MARISHA: Okay.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.740
MARISHA: Sorry, Cad.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.570
MATT: With no disadvantage, because
you have Freedom of Movement.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.460
MARISHA: Perfect, 23.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.200
MATT: I believe that-- does that hit your armor class?

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.260
TALIESIN: That does hit, yes.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.147
LIAM: Wow.
MARISHA: A Stunning Strike.

00:16:38.147 --> 00:16:39.263
MATT: Okay.

00:16:40.222 --> 00:16:41.600
Are you doing damage or are you just--

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.552
are you...?

00:16:42.552 --> 00:16:44.210
MARISHA: Um,

00:16:45.286 --> 00:16:46.119
yeah.
MATT: All right, go ahead and

00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:47.200
roll damage for it.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.033
LAURA: Why?

00:16:49.644 --> 00:16:50.793
MARISHA: Because Beau.

00:16:50.793 --> 00:16:51.950
MATT: Yeah, roll damage.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.392
TALIESIN: I'm okay with this.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.353
MARISHA: 10.

00:16:56.353 --> 00:16:58.030
MATT: So you take 10 points of bludgeoning damage, Caduceus.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.180
I need you to roll a constitution saving throw.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.460
MARISHA: Roll low, please.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.293
LAURA: Come on.

00:17:02.293 --> 00:17:03.860
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw?
MATT: Yes.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.590
TALIESIN: Okay, here's one die that had been sucking.

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.310
SAM: Legendary action.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.250
TALIESIN: 20.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.789
MARISHA: Fuck!

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:14.470
Ah, pop, pop! Cracking it and I'm trying it again.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.630
Stay down, stay down.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.090
MATT: Your turn around and say: Hi! (impacts)

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.410
You're just getting pummeled in the water.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.550
MARISHA: 20 to hit.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.880
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that hits.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.780
MATT: All right, roll damage a second time.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.250
MARISHA: Okay, eight damage and Stunning Strike.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.440
I will knock his ass unconscious.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.240
MATT: Another constitution saving throw.

00:17:40.127 --> 00:17:41.525
TALIESIN: 14?

00:17:41.525 --> 00:17:43.630
MARISHA: Fail, fail.
(cheering)

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.463
You fail.

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:46.120
MATT: Yeah, your body suddenly--

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.362
TALIESIN: I've rolled in--

00:17:48.572 --> 00:17:49.590
MATT: It tightens up. The muscles

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.900
lock up and you're no longer swimming.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.350
You're veering a bit towards the torchbloom.

00:17:56.621 --> 00:17:58.190
MARISHA: I'm going to loop,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.670
do the lifeguard vest hold,

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.490
and start kicking backwards and paddling

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.280
and dragging him out as quickly as I can.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.402
MATT: Okay, dragging him

00:18:06.402 --> 00:18:08.440
will halve your movement.
MARISHA: Will halve my movement.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.860
Yeah, so move, action, Step of the Wind again.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.983
MATT: Okay, you--

00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:16.810
using your-- okay. To get up to him to this point

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.730
because you're moving so fast, it took maybe about,

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.660
with him going forward, I'd say 50 more feet.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.860
So you have, at your double movement,

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.650
you have another 50 feet.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.900
To move backwards now at 25.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.380
And if using your bonus action Step of the Wind,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.740
so you can drag him back 50 feet.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.413
MARISHA: Awesome, I'll drag him back 50 feet.

00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:35.880
MATT: Okay, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.780
because you're now maneuvering you and him

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.630
as fast as you can, backward through a tunnel

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.110
that is surrounded in torchbloom.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.743
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.570
Okay, 19.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.910
MATT: 19, okay.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.903
You manage to just barely maneuver past.

00:18:49.903 --> 00:18:52.360
There are moments where the orange glow gets very intense

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.830
and you instinctually kick away and manage to avoid

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.780
going shoulder first into a batch

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.810
of very thick tangled torchbloom.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.360
MARISHA: Does Caleb see me yet?

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.510
MATT: At this point, with you moving forward,

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.450
you would be able to see her and Caduceus.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.840
You both are now meeting partway in the tunnel,

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.223
MARISHA: Help, it's again.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.360
LIAM: I pull cat's mint out of--

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.550
out of a deep pocket

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.080
and the cat's claw appears near them,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.130
because it's 120-foot range.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.270
And I will just try to grab Caduceus

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.600
and pull them both through,

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.850
like I'm working one of those things in an arcade

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.330
where the claw goes down and grabs a stuffed animal

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.040
and I will pull them through the tunnel.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.290
MATT: Both of them?

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.390
LIAM: Well, they're connected right now.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.577
MATT: They are yes, okay.

00:19:34.577 --> 00:19:36.620
LIAM: I'll grab Caduceus' body.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.680
MATT: Okay.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.190
How much-- how far can you move your

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.140
cat hand in one round?

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.596
LIAM: There is so much text on this spell.

00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:48.278
SAM: I think it's at least 60,

00:19:48.278 --> 00:19:50.486
if not 120.
LIAM: That sounds familiar.

00:19:50.486 --> 00:19:51.450
That's familiar.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.630
So I should see 60 somewhere in this wall of text.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.600
Yeah, 60 feet.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.433
MATT: 60 feet, okay.

00:19:56.433 --> 00:19:59.020
Because it is a magical creation,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.520
it does not deal with the resistance of the water.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.045
Are you holding onto that or are you letting Caduceus go?

00:20:06.853 --> 00:20:07.686
LAURA: (whispered) Let go.

00:20:07.686 --> 00:20:09.370
MARISHA: I'll let go, yeah.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.858
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I'll let go.

00:20:10.858 --> 00:20:13.280
MATT: You let go of Caduceus.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.180
MARISHA: But then I'm going to, like, start

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.540
still swimming that direction,

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.430
like playing goalie on the way back.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.708
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, got it.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:21.708 --> 00:20:22.541
MATT: Got it, okay.

00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:24.382
So as you--
LIAM: It's like Operation.

00:20:24.382 --> 00:20:28.565
MATT: Exactly. As the mystical cat's claw appears

00:20:28.565 --> 00:20:30.430
and it wraps its claws around Caduceus,

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.450
Caduceus still reeling from the impact

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.700
and you holding yourself there,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.450
blocking any further transition into the tunnel.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.780
You guys are a little bit further in.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.540
You've backtracked past the area where it's split.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.060
So now it's just a singular tunnel

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.210
and ahead it would split

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.500
if you were to continue going again.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.810
Using the cat's claw, you watch as Caduceus,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.868
eyes wide, around, suddenly goes

00:20:51.868 --> 00:20:52.701
(whooshing)

00:20:52.701 --> 00:20:55.180
and gets yanked backward out through the tunnel,

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.220
while you guys are both standing there.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.430
From that distance, it's not quite to the entrance,

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.190
but it's right at the cusp.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.980
You guys can barely see in the torchbloom ahead,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.550
you see this mystical, large, familiar,

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.580
orange-colored cat claw

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.160
begin to visually appear from the upward arc

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.110
that the tunnel began to take.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.110
Caduceus.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.230
You are...

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.220
You stunned him, pulled him back.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.140
It's not until your next turn.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.204
So you're stunned, so you can't do anything.

00:21:27.204 --> 00:21:28.963
MARISHA: Yes, that's right!

00:21:28.963 --> 00:21:31.245
MATT: Just until the end of your next turn.

00:21:31.245 --> 00:21:32.440
MARISHA: Monks are the best.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.273
TALIESIN: Darn it!

00:21:33.273 --> 00:21:34.106
Thank you.

00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:36.130
(laughter)

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.090
MATT: Okay, so that would now bring it back to

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.120
Beauregard's turn.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.760
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to follow the cat paw.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.610
MATT: Okay, so--

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.765
TRAVIS: (southern accent) The cat paw.
MARISHA: (southern accent) Cat paw.

00:21:45.765 --> 00:21:47.840
MATT: After you've, Caleb, as you're there floating,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.323
Beauregard has been playing goalie just

00:21:49.323 --> 00:21:50.156
(whooshing)

00:21:50.156 --> 00:21:51.942
darts off and follows afterward.

00:21:51.942 --> 00:21:53.950
You very easily catch up to Caduceus,

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.090
who's now starting to rouse

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.290
and begin to fight against the claw.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.123
MARISHA: And then--

00:21:59.123 --> 00:22:00.520
MATT: There's not enough room for you to go past it.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.550
MARISHA: Still backs up like he said.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.050
I don't entirely know even which sport that's referencing,

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.296
but that's what I'm doing.

00:22:06.296 --> 00:22:09.117
And ... Patient Defense.

00:22:09.117 --> 00:22:11.600
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, just ring his bell if he starts acting up.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.680
MARISHA: Should I just punch him again?

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.690
Just for good measure?
LAURA: Nope.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:15.523
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:22:15.523 --> 00:22:16.356
LAURA: Just push him.

00:22:16.356 --> 00:22:17.878
LIAM: It couldn't hurt.
MATT: What are you going to do?

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:19.253
MARISHA: I'll just wait.
LIAM: It could hurt.

00:22:19.253 --> 00:22:20.680
MARISHA: Just going to wait.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.660
Just keep dragging him.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.780
Are you holding an action or are you?

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.670
MARISHA: I'm going to Patient Defense.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.510
MATT: Okay, so you're--

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.400
LIAM: As we move away from you?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.320
MARISHA: Wait, is that the right call?

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.362
MATT: It's up to you.
LAURA: Just keep moving forward.

00:22:30.362 --> 00:22:32.760
MARISHA: Okay, I'll keep following.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.593
I'll keep following.

00:22:33.593 --> 00:22:34.730
MATT: Right, well, you're right there against them.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.910
There's not enough room to go around.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:36.743
So you have to wait until--

00:22:36.743 --> 00:22:37.576
MARISHA: Can I push them?

00:22:37.576 --> 00:22:39.470
Can I just, like, is that doable?

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.303
MATT: Right now?

00:22:40.303 --> 00:22:42.363
He's being held by an arcane force.

00:22:42.363 --> 00:22:43.610
MARISHA: Oh, fuck it. Crack!

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.780
I'm going to try to knock him again.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.210
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.043
Go for it.

00:22:48.043 --> 00:22:48.876
TRAVIS: When in doubt.

00:22:48.876 --> 00:22:50.050
MATT: He is still stunned, so you have an advantage

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.634
on the attacks.

00:22:51.634 --> 00:22:53.560
LIAM: That's my partner.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.510
MARISHA: There we go. 26.
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.580
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.980
SAM: You're holding Caduceus while
Beau is just pummeling him.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.730
LIAM: I'm all for it.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.630
MARISHA: I rolled shitty. Seven damage.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.011
LIAM: Shouldn't have gone down that hole.

00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:07.250
MATT: Are you Stunning Strike?

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.187
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:10.953
So mark another ki point. Make
another constitution saving throw.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.030
TALIESIN: That would be five.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.438
MARISHA: Failed. He's stunned again.

00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:19.938
MATT: Crack!
TALIESIN: (groans)

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.268
MARISHA: Okay, that's my turn.

00:23:22.268 --> 00:23:23.534
I don't know, I just to wait for him

00:23:23.534 --> 00:23:25.737
to be dragged the fuck out of here.
MATT: Caleb.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.890
LIAM: I'll keep looking over my shoulder

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.110
to get out of the tunnel if I still can.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.380
MATT: Yep, and so you start swimming

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.480
to catch up with them.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.100
And you get a little closer.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:35.933
LIAM: Okay.

00:23:35.933 --> 00:23:37.120
MATT: Your Expeditious Retreat is gone

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.430
because you're now concentrating on the--

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.263
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

00:23:39.263 --> 00:23:40.470
MATT: So you're moving slowly--

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.920
LIAM: We're still in the tunnels at this point?

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.910
MATT: Yeah, you're still in the tunnel.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.200
Because you had to push the claw

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.690
to move him basically ahead of you--

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.553
LIAM: Correct.
MATT: -- towards the exit.

00:23:47.553 --> 00:23:49.240
So you have lost

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.330
for the most part

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.160
sight of the exit,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.300
but you can just barely see where they are

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.940
as it curves upward.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.970
LIAM: Right, I would not let the claw

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.430
get so far ahead of me that I can't

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.421
obviously focus on it.
MATT: Right, but it's just

00:24:01.421 --> 00:24:02.643
at that point where they're about to vanish.

00:24:02.643 --> 00:24:06.450
So you can either continue to move the claw--

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.283
LIAM: No, I will--

00:24:07.283 --> 00:24:08.540
no, I'll wait.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.710
I'll keep moving towards it and pause it--

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.490
the paws as I approach it.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.015
TRAVIS: Pause the paws.
MATT: All right, so still stationary,

00:24:16.015 --> 00:24:19.130
unmoving, holding Caduceus, who is stunned.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.430
All of you-- the rest of you

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.460
can just barely see

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.480
the familiar sight of the cat's claw there

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.130
and some movement and

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.610
a little bit of air escape

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.580
from some sort of strange--

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.250
TRAVIS: Just wait, just let it--

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.460
LAURA: Is he okay?

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.898
Did you get him?

00:24:34.898 --> 00:24:36.377
MARISHA: Yeah. I did.

00:24:36.377 --> 00:24:38.651
Yeah. I don't know if he's okay.

00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:39.820
To be totally honest,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.929
he's probably not.
TRAVIS: You hit him didn't you?

00:24:40.929 --> 00:24:43.996
MARISHA: Yeah. A few times, but I had to.

00:24:43.996 --> 00:24:45.190
TALIESIN: Are we out yet?
MARISHA: I didn't have to.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.023
MATT: Not yet.

00:24:46.023 --> 00:24:48.430
Because the claw hasn't moved since the time before.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.950
LAURA: We're shouting through the water.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.770
MARISHA: Yeah, I hit him!

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.350
MATT: There you go.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.610
Although, if you're just using your action to move as well.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.170
Because it's bonus action to move the claw, right?

00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.430
LIAM: No-- bonus-- oh, yes.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.540
Bonus action to use the claw, that's right.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.130
MATT: You could actually swim 30 feet,

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.230
if you use your action and your movement

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.432
to go 15, 15 underneath.
LIAM: That's true.

00:25:04.432 --> 00:25:05.720
Then all I would be doing is moving the claw.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.220
MATT: Right, so you would be able to move the claw

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.330
just beyond--

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:09.828
LAURA: Yay!

00:25:09.828 --> 00:25:11.502
MATT: -- the entrance, if you'd like to with your bonus.

00:25:11.502 --> 00:25:12.335
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: You guys watch

00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:15.568
as it just pushes past the entranceway.

00:25:15.568 --> 00:25:18.570
The torchbloom themselves are about 10 feet

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.910
from where Caduceus is now being held

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.560
and you can see him limp,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.718
eyes lolling back in the head a little bit.

00:25:24.718 --> 00:25:26.700
A little bit of a blood cloud

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.054
starting to appear at one side of the jaw.

00:25:29.054 --> 00:25:30.890
And there's Beauregard behind going--

00:25:32.207 --> 00:25:33.960
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.020
LIAM: As I catch up the claw goes from this--

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.250
this position to this position

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.158
and Caleb just starts doing this:

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.120
raises Caduceus out.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.330
And the water dripping.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.870
MATT: Okay, Beauregard?

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.660
MARISHA: I'll follow and come up to the surface, yeah.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.601
MATT: Okay.

00:25:51.601 --> 00:25:53.530
MARISHA: Is he still like--

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.340
MATT: He's stunned until the end of your turn.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.608
LAURA: So get him far away.

00:25:56.608 --> 00:25:58.970
Get him as far away from the blooms as we can.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.080
And we can hold on to him.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.920
MATT: All right so coming back to Caleb's next turn.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.960
You're no longer stunned,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.310
but it's not back to your turn yet.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.020
TRAVIS: Nott, you be ready to shoot him.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.415
SAM: I'm ready. (cocks crossbow)

00:26:08.415 --> 00:26:09.520
TRAVIS: We'll kill him if we have to.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.850
SAM: Explosive arrow.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.970
MATT: You watch as the cat's claw-- every time.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.500
The cat's claw, much like a cat's claw machine,

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.050
drags the soaking wet Caduceus out of the water

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.470
and above the surface.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.650
And he's now dangling wet, dripping,

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.130
and just shaking his head.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.310
You are in a lot of pain.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.810
Your head is pounding,

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:36.632
but the compulsion to swim
towards the tunnel has passed.

00:26:36.632 --> 00:26:40.210
(cheering)

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.230
MARISHA: Shit.

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:42.320
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.199
SAM: That was crazy.

00:26:43.199 --> 00:26:44.032
TALIESIN: That's really dangerous.

00:26:44.032 --> 00:26:46.160
You shouldn't go anywhere near that.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.820
LAURA: Get him on to-- get him onto the deck

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.860
of one of the ships.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.090
LIAM: That's what I was waiting to do.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.300
Yeah, I'm going to get him onto the nearest deck of a boat.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.350
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That we can gather.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.700
TALIESIN: That was my bad, oh.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.660
MATT: All righty.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.760
ASHLEY: I mean, to be fair it happened to us, too.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.410
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.890
We just weren't alone, and you know.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.248
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, buddy system.
LIAM: Yes, buddy system.

00:27:06.248 --> 00:27:07.382
SAM: Yes, buddy system.

00:27:07.382 --> 00:27:08.490
TRAVIS: I think it's more than that.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.590
I kind of was with you and you blinded me twice.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.423
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

00:27:12.423 --> 00:27:14.190
TRAVIS: It was a bit overt.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.690
TALIESIN: I mean...

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.823
you know.

00:27:16.823 --> 00:27:18.126
TRAVIS: "You know"?

00:27:18.126 --> 00:27:19.726
SAM: (laughs) That's his--

00:27:19.726 --> 00:27:21.340
TALIESIN: It seemed to be the thing to do at the time.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.280
TRAVIS: I understand.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.113
Not at all.

00:27:23.113 --> 00:27:24.880
MATT: The nearest ship that you find is a

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.960
small fishing vessel

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.930
called the Fiona and you just go ahead

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.590
and drag Caduceus up onto it.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.120
You guys gather up onto it there.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.711
TALIESIN: I think-- I-- well.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.420
Yeah, I'll-- I'll fix this.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.017
This is-- this is my fault.
LAURA: You want me to fix you, Caduceus?

00:27:43.017 --> 00:27:44.242
TALIESIN: I mean, I feel--

00:27:44.242 --> 00:27:45.693
well, I feel a little bad.

00:27:45.693 --> 00:27:47.000
I'm a little embarrassed, but--

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.440
LAURA: We should take a rest.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.115
We should take a rest.
TALIESIN: Oh my god, we should take a rest.

00:27:51.115 --> 00:27:52.098
TALIESIN: I think a rest would be good.

00:27:52.098 --> 00:27:53.490
LAURA: You know what we should do?

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.059
TALIESIN: Make-- make tea.

00:27:57.059 --> 00:27:59.233
LAURA: You know what we should do?
TALIESIN: Put a kettle on.

00:27:59.233 --> 00:28:00.480
LAURA: We should have a feast.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.390
TRAVIS: Oh, what kind of feast?

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.160
LIAM: A fancy one?
LAURA: A fancy feast.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.360
A Heroes' Fancy Feast.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.440
SAM: Cat food?

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.190
LAURA: No, just a-- you know, just a feast that's fancy.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.020
SAM: Where are we going to get a feast that's fancy?

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.210
We're in a bunch of old boats.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.217
LAURA: I can make one.

00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:19.540
SAM: You're not a cook.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.200
LAURA: No, I can make a magical one.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.980
And I even prepared for this a long time ago.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.746
Because I have a jeweled chalice.

00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:26.862
TRAVIS: Hey!

00:28:26.862 --> 00:28:28.410
And that will help us?

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.920
LAURA: Oh, it's going to help us do so many things.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.300
Let me tell you all about it.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.580
When I find the spell.
SAM: Wait, before you do this--

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.580
TALIESIN: I don't think we're going to go

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.510
back in there anytime soon.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.530
LAURA: We're not?

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.860
LIAM: Caleb huffs and heaves over to Beauregard

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.527
because he's not an athlete and goes

00:28:44.527 --> 00:28:46.520
(breathing heavily)

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.030
and gives a weak little punch to her arms.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.590
That's-- that's-- you do good work.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.190
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MARISHA: Thank you-- what?

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.065
Thank you-- what?

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.460
LAURA: Would you guys rather,

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.490
we not go in again today and wait til tomorrow?

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.030
TALIESIN: I'm pretty tapped.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.960
And we could go to the Ruins maybe.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.783
LIAM: Maybe we could just sit down for a little bit.

00:29:07.783 --> 00:29:10.149
TRAVIS: Yeah, short rest, the minimum.

00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:11.840
SAM: Is it day time?

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.710
TRAVIS: We have to-- and we can check on all these ships.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.150
SAM: Oh yeah, we woke up and just walked in here.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.860
It's, like, 10 in the morning.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.490
TRAVIS: We're going to check out these boats and then nope.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.133
TALIESIN: Elevensies.

00:29:22.133 --> 00:29:23.860
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: Still pre-noon.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.549
SAM: So then should we wait on the feast until we know

00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:30.460
like, if we're going to do something else today?

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.879
TALIESIN: I feel like--
SAM: I'm not really hungry.

00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:33.640
LAURA: It lasts 24 hours.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.210
TRAVIS: If we know we're going in, we should do it.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.260
LAURA: If we know what we're
going to go in tomorrow morning,

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.160
we should do it.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.650
I just don't want to let it get too late again.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:41.922
And then it's too late.

00:29:41.922 --> 00:29:42.982
LIAM: What are we doing in the morning?

00:29:42.982 --> 00:29:45.000
TALIESIN: I would say breakfast in the morning, maybe.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.940
MARISHA: Well, remember every time we sleep here--

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.292
TRAVIS: That's the other part.

00:29:48.292 --> 00:29:51.866
LAURA: This will give us advantage
on all of our wisdom saving throws.

00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:52.917
You know, whatever that means.

00:29:52.917 --> 00:29:54.690
TRAVIS: If we were going to try to go to the Ruins

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.840
and gamble with another wake up.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.148
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:29:58.148 --> 00:30:00.150
TRAVIS: Or we could kill him and then try.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.833
MARISHA: We could also--
ASHLEY: I like that idea.

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.200
MARISHA: Because, you know,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.160
it's like, it's a mental thing, right?

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.260
So if we have the feast right before we go to bed,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.770
maybe it'll help the next morning?

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.053
Was it a wisdom saving throw all that we were making?

00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:16.250
LAURA: Yeah, that's the thing.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.083
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:17.083 --> 00:30:18.610
MARISHA: So let's do it right before we go to bed.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.870
TALIESIN: I love supper. It's after dinner.
LIAM: (breathless) How about

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.645
a rest with a snack,

00:30:24.645 --> 00:30:27.080
and then we tour the boats.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.910
SAM: You guys rest, I'm going
to go start touring some boats.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.270
TALIESIN: You've never hit me before.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.860
TRAVIS: Are you all right, Caleb?

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:34.743
LIAM: Oh, you know.

00:30:34.743 --> 00:30:36.720
TALIESIN: That's amazing. You're really good at that.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.950
LIAM: Swimming's not my strong suit.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:39.783
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:30:39.783 --> 00:30:41.865
LAURA: You were really brave, Caleb.
TRAVIS: You did very well.

00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:45.830
LIAM: Well, we need the tall guy.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.388
LAURA: Yes, we do.

00:30:47.388 --> 00:30:49.138
He's really good at healing.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.490
TRAVIS: Is there a particular boat that we should all

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.920
sit on and check out?

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.610
SAM: We're on The Fiona.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.360
Maybe we can at least check this one out

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.537
while we're sitting here, right?

00:30:58.537 --> 00:31:00.300
MARISHA: What's the biggest, fanciest looking boat?

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.300
You mentioned it.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.159
LIAM: Yeah.

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:04.120
MATT: The biggest boat that you came across is massive.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.220
It's much larger than the Balleater was.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.560
It looked like what you could see from

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.393
just the glances.

00:31:11.393 --> 00:31:13.170
You were swimming by when you first were inspecting.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.708
You can see the tips of a couple of ballistae

00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:18.370
that were set up on the deck.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.590
Or not on the deck, but like,

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.400
like inside the gun deck with the--

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.200
some of them were open.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.360
Which leads you to believe it might've been

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.127
been here pre-cannon technology.
LIAM: I was going to ask

00:31:32.127 --> 00:31:35.300
if it looks the same as the boats of the day

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.080
or how old it seems.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.540
MATT: I mean, boat technology

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.340
doesn't advance dramatically, but.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.750
LIAM: But decoration, flags, symbols.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.510
MATT: It seems at least it was built in the last

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.910
maybe hundred years or so

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.418
is the best you can gather.
You're not a master of ship--

00:31:51.418 --> 00:31:53.501
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: -- architecture, necessarily.

00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:55.050
You, if you want to make a history check

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.772
might be able to have a
better view on that.

00:31:57.772 --> 00:31:59.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, history.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.490
Rolled for that before in this campaign.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.270
13.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:04.730
MATT: 13, okay.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.730
Looking at how well the ship

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.530
has been kept in here,

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:13.300
like the quality and shape it it's in, the construct of it.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:18.300
You gather it probably once belonged to

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:22.892
somebody like a major, major shipping company

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.495
out of Port Damali.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.920
And it was converted with defenses

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.650
because it was carrying probably a lot

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.260
of really, really nice goods.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.390
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:38.030
MATT: But based on the fact that
it's using older ballista,

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.962
it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of

00:32:40.962 --> 00:32:42.440
60 to a 100 years old.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.010
TRAVIS: Probably in the neighborhood
of 60 to a 100 years old

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.630
and heavily armed, probably.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:47.463
LIAM: I'll tell you what,

00:32:47.463 --> 00:32:49.594
I don't know how we get it out of here yet,

00:32:49.594 --> 00:32:52.600
but I'd like to see you the captain of that ship.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.460
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.758
MATT: You do see the name of it, too.

00:32:54.758 --> 00:32:57.600
It's called Eden's Horizon.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.810
TRAVIS: Eden's Horizon.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.430
LAURA: Does that mean anything to you, Fjord?
TRAVIS: Does that mean anything to me?

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.730
MATT: Not specifically.
TRAVIS: Not specifically.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.320
(laughter)

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.140
LAURA: 60 to 70 years old you said, Fjord?

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.110
TRAVIS: Roughly.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.943
LAURA: Wow.

00:33:12.943 --> 00:33:16.376
That means Vo's been here that long?

00:33:16.376 --> 00:33:17.682
TRAVIS: It seems so.

00:33:17.682 --> 00:33:20.690
MATT: At least it was built during that time.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.050
TRAVIS: A properly kept ship could
be on the water for quite a while.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.460
LAURA: That's true.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.610
TRAVIS: Maintained.

00:33:29.385 --> 00:33:31.020
LAURA: Do you think there's still
really fancy things on there?

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.920
Let's go find out.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.710
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.710
Should we finish this short rest here on Fiona?

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.000
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.650
MATT: Okay, so you complete your short rest.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:39.810
Easy enough, so you guys go and take that.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.330
Spend your hit dice to heal up, if you'd like,

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.010
and get spells back or anything that has a

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.885
short rest recovery period.

00:33:49.184 --> 00:33:50.141
SAM: Doing a short rest?

00:33:50.141 --> 00:33:51.730
MATT: Yes.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.500
TALIESIN: Fuck, I'm killing it.

00:33:54.433 --> 00:33:58.650
Miss my-- I miss my-- my-- little pendant.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.320
LIAM: I've done a bit.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.153
TALIESIN: Three.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.465
TRAVIS: Caduceus, while we're resting, there's no, like,

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.930
communicating with the Wild Mother to see if

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:14.617
anyone is still on our tail from previous chases, is there?

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.980
TALIESIN: Not today.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.446
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: I mean, other than--

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.480
I mean, sometimes you can just get lucky, but--

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.110
TRAVIS: We're just in such a unique pickle,

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.070
I would hate for, you know,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.151
scouts of Uk'otoa to show up here.

00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:31.540
MARISHA and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.
TRAVIS: Jesus.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.373
TALIESIN: I'm a--

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.160
I'm a big believer in just dealing

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.220
with what's in front of you

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.190
until it's not there any more and then,

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.270
when you've got breathing room

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.310
look beyond the horizon.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.800
TRAVIS: I normally would agree with you,

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.000
but the last time I did that, I got stabbed in the chest

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.290
in the middle of my REM sleep.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.265
TALIESIN: That's fair. That's never happened to me before.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.620
Yeah, that definitely--

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.920
that'd leave a mark.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.999
TRAVIS: Yeah, it did.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.173
Okay.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.600
TALIESIN: I suppose--

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.570
I haven't used my

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.240
Hail Mary percentile roll today.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.948
MATT: You have not.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.160
TRAVIS: You don't-- you don't--

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.020
TALIESIN: No, I'm thinking of-- if there's a big ask

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.862
that would be amusing.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.940
LAURA: Have her send somebody along to help us defeat...

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.550
TRAVIS: Guacamole.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.160
TALIESIN: That feels like a different kind of ask

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.190
than you normally get out of something like this.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.790
LAURA: Oh, really?

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.965
I don't know how it works.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.430
TALIESIN: I would love to know
who we face, and what he is,

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.610
and where he comes from.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.800
TRAVIS: Mmm, good.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.062
Roll high, low.

00:35:44.062 --> 00:35:45.923
TALIESIN: Low.
LAURA: Roll low.

00:35:45.923 --> 00:35:47.773
(gasps)
MARISHA: Wait, what.

00:35:47.773 --> 00:35:48.740
LAURA: Did you succeed?

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.070
TALIESIN: Let me-- I got to look it up.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.610
LAURA: If you rolled below your level.
MATT: Below your level.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.551
TALIESIN: I rolled a five.

00:35:54.551 --> 00:35:56.190
MARISHA: (screaming)

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.773
TRAVIS: You did? You really did?

00:35:57.773 --> 00:36:00.790
SAM: Is this Divine Intervention?
ASHLEY: No way, this is going to work.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.225
TALIESIN: I've been rolling so low
and finally it's paid off.

00:36:04.225 --> 00:36:06.080
(laughter)

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.130
Yep, yep, that's the zero zero five.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.427
Yep yep, that's--

00:36:10.327 --> 00:36:12.177
I'm so sorry, Matt.
MATT: No, no, no, no.

00:36:12.177 --> 00:36:14.363
TALIESIN: Holy shit.
MATT: Okay, okay.

00:36:14.363 --> 00:36:16.283
TRAVIS: Zero zero is zero, right? It's not a hundred?

00:36:16.283 --> 00:36:18.482
TALIESIN: I had to double check because
I was like eight, nine, oh yeah.

00:36:18.482 --> 00:36:19.315
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:36:19.315 --> 00:36:21.767
MATT: Okay, so while you all are resting and snacking

00:36:21.767 --> 00:36:26.767
and hearing the heavy dripping sound of water

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.730
and streams breaking through from the pools above,

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.780
at the base of the volcanic mountain.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.950
You sit here and quietly concentrate.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.270
Close your eyes, finding that space of peace,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.600
that point of connection with nature

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.649
and with the Wild Mother herself.

00:36:39.649 --> 00:36:40.740
You hear the droplets

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.216
(water droplets plopping)

00:36:43.216 --> 00:36:45.300
around and then with each impact,

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.493
there's an echo and the echo gets louder.

00:36:47.493 --> 00:36:50.440
(droplets echoing)

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.750
As the echoes begin to swirl,

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.510
it becomes this low hum.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.960
This strange rhythmic beat.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.450
And as the beat comes through,

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:03.210
you can feel your consciousness lifting.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.800
And it's not you expanding, but it's her.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.023
It's the Wild Mother.

00:37:08.023 --> 00:37:10.940
You can feel her arms taking you by the head

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.928
and lifting you into a dark space.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.160
In this dark space, as the echoes are surrounding you,

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.990
the loud swirling noise of water droplets

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.320
hitting surfaces and rocks crumbling.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.080
You suddenly see

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.790
a silver gossamer sky.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.615
Swirls of

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.170
strange clouds and sparkles

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.540
a familiar space.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.130
You've been here before.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.046
Briefly.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:51.670
You stepped into a creature's
mouth in a space like this.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:56.190
And here you see, you sense something.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.980
You sense fear.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.415
You sense something fleeing.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.686
Something

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.800
desperately trying to escape.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:08.845
You sense

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.870
whatever this Vokodo was and is,

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.570
but <i>was</i>, running.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.730
Running from something.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.570
And as it crashes through

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.230
the silver,

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.390
it crashes through the boundaries.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:30.300
It crashes into this island.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.180
And the impact of it crashing

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.390
drags shards of other places with it.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.973
And you see as it lands at the base of this volcano,

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.060
the volcano changes it.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.813
And it changes the island that houses this volcano.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:56.290
You don't fully understand what this is,

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.900
but you know it's not from here.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:03.107
It has origins somewhere in the Astral Sea.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.297
And it came here to hide.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.140
TALIESIN: From something in the Astral Sea?

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.230
SAM: (whispering) Astral Sea.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.570
MATT: And with that, you

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.973
feel that sense of something looking upon you once more.

00:39:22.973 --> 00:39:27.840
That familiar glaring, present

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.230
intrusive sense of Vokodo sensing you nearby

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.540
and the Wild Mother sets you back

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.140
as to where you once were sitting,

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.850
knowing that to peer any further into places

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.399
you shouldn't be looking would be unwise.

00:39:42.399 --> 00:39:43.715
TRAVIS: (laughs in awe)

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:46.050
MATT: And with that, she releases you.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.940
The droplets, the echoes subside.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.921
And once again, you're left there
sitting on the deck of the ship hearing:

00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:53.892
(water droplets plopping)

00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:56.180
As you take a deep breath and open your eyes

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.260
once more amongst your friends,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.760
chewing on their rations, bandaging their wounds

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.750
and preparing for whatever the next step

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.140
of your journey may be.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.970
LAURA: You okay, Caduceus? You look
like you're having a day dream.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.520
TALIESIN: I, uh

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.425
I know where he came from.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.650
LAURA: Who?

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:15.680
TALIESIN: Vokodo.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.740
LAURA: What?

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.510
ASHLEY: How do you know that?

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.093
TALIESIN: I had a vision.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:22.060
LAURA: You had a vision?

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.580
TALIESIN: Very, very nice cave.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.520
LAURA: That's so fucking cool.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.710
TRAVIS: Do you know where he came from?

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:28.543
SAM: Where?

00:40:28.543 --> 00:40:30.690
TALIESIN: He escaped from the Astral Sea.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.580
Being chased by something,

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.670
something he fears.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.430
He's hiding from it.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:38.263
His escape,

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.260
shattered reality on this island.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.350
He's the reason why it's broken

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.310
and the volcano did something to him.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.200
He's been changed by it.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.120
He's afraid.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.654
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: But not of us.

00:40:54.654 --> 00:40:56.020
TRAVIS: You said he's hiding.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.853
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:40:56.853 --> 00:40:59.320
TRAVIS: Was he being chased?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.590
TALIESIN: At one point, or at the very least he was running.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.540
LAURA: The Astral Sea.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.340
SAM: Vilya-- is Vilya with us?

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.170
MATT: Vilya is with you and is currently listening to this.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:13.260
SAM: Is the Astral Sea where you were hunting this kraken

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.673
or is that a different place?
MATT: "No, no."

00:41:14.673 --> 00:41:18.400
LAURA: The Astral Sea, that's where we were
in the Happy Fun Ball wasn't it?

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.590
TALIESIN: I believe there was a moment of that, yes.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.480
MARISHA: Beau-- would Beau know?

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.280
MATT: Yes, you and Caleb both

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.610
were conscious of

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.660
the plane that you were stepping through,

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.510
where you can upon the astral dreadnought.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:31.980
The large chained creature in

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.250
the Folding Halls of Halas that you had

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.400
stepped into its maw.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.557
LAURA: Like you do.
MATT: Like you do.

00:41:40.557 --> 00:41:41.615
TRAVIS: No problem.

00:41:41.615 --> 00:41:44.180
SAM: So if he came from the Astral Sea,

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.870
does that mean that

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:49.280
like this spout of seawater that's coming in,

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.870
there's another rift somewhere on
this island that leads there, maybe?

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.520
TALIESIN: Could be.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.800
TRAVIS: Sounds like a few other rifts.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.633
LAURA: Yikes.

00:41:58.633 --> 00:42:01.823
TALIESIN: I think he broke the island.

00:42:01.823 --> 00:42:03.630
MARISHA: He broke through a barrier.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.250
TRAVIS: And if he's hiding does that mean that something

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.490
bigger or worse is coming?

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.700
LAURA: Or is looking for him?

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.440
Like maybe we could find whatever's looking for him

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.800
and let them know where he is.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.780
TRAVIS: He's been here for almost 25 years, at least.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.320
Because of Vilya.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.380
MATT: Best that you can tell based on the information,

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.280
if it's reliable,

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.518
because it's hard to rely on
the memories of those who live here.

00:42:25.518 --> 00:42:27.940
There've been many generations that have lived

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.100
their time on the island.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.540
If that's true, he's been here for

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.540
possibly a couple of hundred years.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.760
TRAVIS: Hiding very successfully.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.220
MATT: But at the very least, he's been here for 25 to 30

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.770
based on what Vilya was saying.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.837
LIAM: Maybe we could send him back.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:46.225
LAURA: That'd be cool.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.560
Let's just use-- I have Banishment.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.360
I mean, I think it would probably work.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.510
TRAVIS: Can you pick where he goes?

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.020
LIAM: Yeah, as do I.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.890
TALIESIN: You send them back.
LIAM: As do you.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.890
TRAVIS: Can you choose to send him

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.160
to a specific place?

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.150
MATT: Banishment sends them to their home plane.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:02.751
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:03.830
MATT: Wherever that may be.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.078
SAM: For a minute.
MATT: For a minute.

00:43:05.078 --> 00:43:07.090
And if they're in their home plane,

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:08.640
it shunts them to...

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.280
I don't know if it's something
you choose or if it's just at random.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.460
LAURA: Once they go to their
home plane they can't come back, or--?

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.540
LIAM: If the spell lasts its duration

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.950
and doesn't get interrupted.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:19.390
They're there, they stay there.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.860
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can lock them.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.730
If you know their home plane, you can lock them there.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:28.730
LIAM: So you, and you and I could--

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:29.933
TALIESIN: Especially if we--

00:43:29.933 --> 00:43:32.070
LIAM: -- take turns trying to--

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.630
TALIESIN: I can also maybe weaken him.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:35.560
LAURA: We'd have to weaken his wisdom.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.300
Is that what it is? I think it's wisdom.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.349
TALIESIN: I can do that. Maybe.

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:46.100
I bet he's hard to banish.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.071
LAURA: Yeah-- his charisma.

00:43:48.071 --> 00:43:50.252
Ooh, I bet his charisma's pretty high.

00:43:50.252 --> 00:43:53.590
SAM: You might not even need to do that, though.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.290
If you just threatened him with that,

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:59.060
it might be enough to make a bargain or something?

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.405
No?
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:44:00.405 --> 00:44:01.690
TALIESIN: I think a bargain is possible.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.743
TRAVIS: Someone threatens us,
we normally, you know (click click).

00:44:04.743 --> 00:44:06.490
SAM: Oh, we're real stupid, though.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:07.423
TRAVIS: That's true.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.070
TALIESIN: Maybe we can offer
him something he <i>really</i> wants?

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.590
Maybe he's collecting all these things just in case.

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:18.100
SAM: Maybe we could act.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.120
We could pretend to be the thing that's hunting him.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.970
LAURA: What if I sent him a message?
SAM: We were like, "We found you,

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.261
"we came from the Astral Sea!"

00:44:25.261 --> 00:44:28.200
TRAVIS: "We're a bunch of kobolds in a jacket!"

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.587
SAM: "We're here to get you!"

00:44:30.587 --> 00:44:31.980
MARISHA: We're going to serve him papers.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.367
LAURA: I could send him a message.

00:44:33.367 --> 00:44:36.310
Did you get the image of what it was that was hunting him?

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:37.840
TALIESIN: Did I get an image of what was hunting him?

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.198
I don't think I did.
MATT: You didn't.

00:44:39.198 --> 00:44:40.990
TALIESIN: I did not.
LIAM: We are also not entirely sure

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.927
he's not watching this conversation right now.

00:44:43.927 --> 00:44:44.760
LAURA: Well.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.535
SAM: Well, we've been calling him Guacamole, so he

00:44:47.535 --> 00:44:49.535
doesn't know we're talking about him at all.

00:44:49.535 --> 00:44:51.680
TALIESIN: It's possible we can-- knowing that.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.665
TRAVIS: And he has your thing--

00:44:52.665 --> 00:44:54.737
TALIESIN: We may be able to
offer him something he really wants.

00:44:54.737 --> 00:44:56.520
TRAVIS: -- that allows you to remain hidden right?

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.353
LAURA: Like what?

00:44:57.353 --> 00:44:59.282
TALIESIN: Safety.
LIAM: Correct.

00:44:59.282 --> 00:45:00.315
TALIESIN: That's why he's here.

00:45:00.315 --> 00:45:03.205
LIAM: Although he had quite a lot of bling attached to him,

00:45:03.205 --> 00:45:06.370
so he might not be able to use everything on him.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.920
TRAVIS: Right.
TALIESIN: Actually, hm.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.192
Huh.

00:45:11.192 --> 00:45:12.890
I have an idea, just in case I don't want to say it

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.380
out loud, but maybe.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.430
Maybe we have exactly the thing he wants.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.223
TRAVIS: Which is...?

00:45:19.223 --> 00:45:21.390
MARISHA: Do we need to do charades?

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.300
SAM: We probably should.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.133
ASHLEY: Sounds like--

00:45:23.133 --> 00:45:24.833
MARISHA: Three.
SAM: The happy?

00:45:24.833 --> 00:45:26.750
LAURA: Oh!

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.800
SAM: We don't have it.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.890
TALIESIN: We can get it.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.180
SAM: Oh, not today.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.637
TALIESIN: No, but deals can be made.

00:45:33.637 --> 00:45:34.730
If you really want to hide,

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:35.970
there's nowhere better to hide.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:37.390
ASHLEY: Wait, who has that?

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.720
SAM: We gave it to Yoda, Yuzo.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.080
LAURA: Yussa.
SAM: Yussa.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.100
LAURA: I don't think he's going to
give it back to us, though.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.570
SAM: Yuzu.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:46.880
MARISHA: Definitely not going to give it back

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.920
to give it to an astral

00:45:50.962 --> 00:45:51.800
deity.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.510
LAURA: Is he, like, a god, is he actually a god then?

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.870
Is he from, like, a long, long, long time ago?

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.160
Wasn't there, like, a Calamity or something?

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.700
TALIESIN: I think there's less of a god and more of a goon.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.740
MARISHA: What would I know about the Astral Plane?

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:04.990
Would I know a decent amount?

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:06.560
MATT: Make an arcana check.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.400
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Arcana check?

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.440
TRAVIS: No, you're just very excited.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.320
TALIESIN: Not give it to him, but let him hide inside of it.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.140
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: 16.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:16.973
TRAVIS: Do you want to?

00:46:16.973 --> 00:46:19.410
MATT: From what you know of the Astral Sea.

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.650
It is one of those boundary planes

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.760
that sits between many of the other realms.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.593
It is

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.178
an amorphous

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.700
realm where

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.380
the will and the imagination has influence

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.380
over the space around you.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.850
That's how you're able to will yourselves

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:41.760
to fly and float in the time that you spent there.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.230
Some creatures that live there

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.590
and have been there for an extended period of time

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:48.440
or their species has been there for a long time,

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.620
have learned to actually shape the

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.020
amorphous matter and energy of it

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.385
of it into actual structures and objects.

00:46:58.052 --> 00:47:00.960
If this creature, if it hails from there

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.840
probably is a very psychic-oriented creature,

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.740
and based on what Caduceus said,

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.670
explains why whatever it did

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.110
to try and break through to escape, also

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.270
took these shards of other places and jammed it here,

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:21.280
was a very singular, dangerous,

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.570
little burst.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:26.400
And that's as much as you can really gather out of it.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.320
Based on how it looks, it definitely fits

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.680
the somewhat, you know,

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.570
tentacled, floaty type cosmic creature

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:36.880
that you would assume some,

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.570
some things there might look like,

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.731
but that's as best as you can ascertain with that roll.

00:47:41.731 --> 00:47:43.340
TALIESIN: A little bit of the

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.606
Beetlejuice.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.300
TRAVIS: So we have two options, we--

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.020
TALIESIN: We should be looking at
boats while we talk about this.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.780
TRAVIS: Yeah. We face him or we

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.250
check out the Ruins first.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:00.260
TALIESIN: If we can find something of the Astral Sea

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.470
that might be helpful.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:03.520
SAM: What do you think we'll find at the Ruins?

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.900
I mean, given what we know about the island

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.180
and given what we've seen here,

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.680
possibly a rift to another place, right?

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.590
Other than that, what do you really expect that we can

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:16.640
have that we can use?

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.920
LIAM: Well, the Ruins were described to us

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.750
as very other worldly and unlike this place.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:25.220
So it could possibly lead us to answers

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.260
for what this thing is running from, its real story.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.230
And we also know that he didn't want us to find this place,

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.040
which has shown us

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.960
very probably a backdoor to his home.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.447
And a new boat for you.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:41.860
TRAVIS: For us, for us.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.593
LIAM: Yeah.

00:48:43.593 --> 00:48:44.426
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at this thing.

00:48:44.426 --> 00:48:46.120
SAM: Were the Ruins off-limits as well?

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.320
LIAM: That is correct.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.470
SAM: Were they off-limits or were they just dangerous?

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:50.780
LAURA: No, they were off-limits.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.210
LIAM: Vokodo didn't--
LAURA: Right, Vilya?

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:56.010
MATT: "Yes, pretty much everyone within Vo

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.060
"was told not to go to the Ruins,

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.230
"that it was too dangerous,

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.160
"and we were being protected by Vokodo

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.560
"from what ever resided there."

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.720
TRAVIS: Well, that's bullshit.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.420
LAURA: There were T-rexes, I mean.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.460
LIAM: This creature is manipulating all the people of Vo

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.590
So he is using them.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.600
He's lying to them and he doesn't want them to go there.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.440
Which means we want to go there.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.890
TRAVIS: It could be an item, a weapon,

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:16.880
something we could use.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.110
LAURA: Maybe one of these shards that broke through.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.360
TALIESIN: Whatever's pissed off about him.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.193
LIAM: Correct.

00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:23.330
TALIESIN: A magic mirror to talk to, like,

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.590
pissed off people in the Astral Sea.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.950
TRAVIS: Is that something that you have seen previously?

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.190
TALIESIN: I mean, we were in that very,

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.550
like, I had a vision with a lot of glass.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.210
There was a lot going on.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.180
I don't know.

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.013
SAM: You've had a day.

00:49:37.013 --> 00:49:38.319
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:39.830
LAURA: Think about it, if you had been taken

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:40.940
and eaten by him,

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.600
we would have never known all these things.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.100
TALIESIN: That would have been unfortunate, yeah.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.350
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:47.470
MARISHA: Vilya.

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:50.290
Does anyone tell you what these buildings,

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:53.772
what these Ruins look like?

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.140
At Heaven's Gate?

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.716
MATT: "From the--"
MARISHA: Heaven's break?

00:49:58.716 --> 00:49:59.627
No, wait.

00:49:59.627 --> 00:50:02.344
MATT: Heaven's Gate is a whole different thing.

00:50:02.344 --> 00:50:03.986
TRAVIS: The Nikes!
MARISHA: Different cult.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.430
MATT: Heaven Falls is where you are right now.

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:08.200
The Ruins is what I think you're discussing.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.475
MARISHA: Yes, the Ruins.

00:50:09.475 --> 00:50:10.320
MATT: She says,

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.110
"I've only gotten close enough to look overhead.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:15.826
"And I mean, some of them look,

00:50:15.826 --> 00:50:17.470
"I mean, at least terrestrial,

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:21.300
"though old, but nothing I recognize.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.668
"Definitely ominous."

00:50:24.737 --> 00:50:26.290
MARISHA: Terrestrial.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.350
LAURA: Ooh.
LIAM: Well.

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.600
MARISHA: I wonder if that's where he crashed.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.830
LIAM: Here's what we have to weigh.

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:33.760
We want to nip this in the bud because, obviously,

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.660
the clock is ticking on us being able

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.830
to remember who we are.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:40.940
Right, but we also don't know what we are marching into.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.890
We just went to great trouble to bring you back

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.320
so that we didn't go in unprepared.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.750
We could be more prepared.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:48.360
TRAVIS: True.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.220
LIAM: I say we go to the Ruins.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.400
After spending some time here.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.710
SAM: We're going to look around the boats, right?

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.046
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's search The Fiona,

00:50:55.046 --> 00:50:56.879
and then we'll make our way--
LAURA: The Fiona's a fishing boat,

00:50:56.879 --> 00:50:59.100
but yeah, let's search the fancy one.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.840
We're going to search the fancy one.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.950
SAM: We're on The Fiona. Let's just go look

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:04.460
downstairs for 10 minutes.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.870
TRAVIS: Don't judge a book by its cover.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.870
MATT: So as you guys finish your short rest.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.620
TALIESIN: Yeah, sure.

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.313
MATT: I would like you all--

00:51:12.313 --> 00:51:15.360
LAURA: Oh no.
MARISHA: (sings circus music)

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.343
LAURA: We should have had a feast.

00:51:16.343 --> 00:51:19.010
MATT: -- to make an investigation check.
LIAM: To reach under your chair.

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.843
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:20.930
TRAVIS: So worried about it.

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.250
LAURA: Can we Guide ourselves to do better?

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.560
MATT: No, because you are not aware of this happening.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.458
LAURA: Oh no.

00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:27.676
MARISHA: Is it one of those things?

00:51:27.676 --> 00:51:29.290
SAM: Is this for investigating The Fiona?

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:30.500
LAURA: This is for investigating--

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.370
MATT: This is just everyone make an investigation check.

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.190
MARISHA: This is because the gnomes.
TRAVIS: 25.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.373
Natural 19.

00:51:36.373 --> 00:51:37.464
MARISHA: The garden gnomes--
LIAM: 27.

00:51:37.464 --> 00:51:39.170
MARISHA: -- have stolen our stuff again.

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:40.003
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:51:40.003 --> 00:51:40.836
SAM: 30.

00:51:40.836 --> 00:51:42.340
LIAM: Ooh!

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.660
MATT: Got some minds in here.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:44.910
LAURA: 15.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:45.870
MATT: All right.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:47.510
TALIESIN: 13, which is good for me.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.750
ASHLEY: 21.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:49.583
MARISHA: 24.

00:51:49.583 --> 00:51:50.416
MATT: Jesus!

00:51:50.416 --> 00:51:51.890
SAM: These are sick!

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.130
LIAM: We found everything, we found everything.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:55.800
MATT: Yeah, that's great.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.798
TRAVIS: On the fishing boat.
MATT: Caduceus,

00:51:57.798 --> 00:52:01.695
pick an item on your equipment list.
LAURA: It's all going missing still.

00:52:01.695 --> 00:52:02.528
MATT: And it's gone.

00:52:02.528 --> 00:52:04.140
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: I mean, keep tabs on it.

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.275
You had it, but it's gone.
TALIESIN: But I haven't noticed anything's gone.

00:52:06.275 --> 00:52:07.333
Well, I haven't looked for any--

00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:09.660
Well, actually, I would've
looked for my hat, at this point.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.630
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:11.463
MATT: Yeah, your hat.

00:52:11.463 --> 00:52:13.120
Where'd your hat go? That's weird.

00:52:15.442 --> 00:52:17.830
LAURA: How does he keep taking our stuff?

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:18.734
TRAVIS: Ricochet.

00:52:18.734 --> 00:52:19.567
SAM: I haven't missed anything.

00:52:19.567 --> 00:52:20.508
Well, I have missed anything.

00:52:20.508 --> 00:52:22.991
I haven't been looking for it.
TRAVIS: Who's talking right now?

00:52:22.991 --> 00:52:24.900
LIAM: Could be unrelated. Maybe.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.640
MARISHA: How is he taking our stuff?

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.583
LAURA: How's he doing our stuff?
SAM: What'd you lose there, Caducey?

00:52:28.583 --> 00:52:30.900
ASHLEY: That's the thing that's weird.

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.868
TALIESIN: My wok.
ASHLEY: But you don't know?

00:52:33.868 --> 00:52:35.790
TALIESIN: My cooking--
LIAM: He's from the Astral Plane.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.460
MARISHA: Yeah, he can probably just reach through

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:38.890
and be like, "Mine now."

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:40.307
LIAM: He sees it, he thinks it, it's gone.

00:52:40.307 --> 00:52:41.700
MARISHA: And then thinks it and wants it, yeah.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.810
Absolutely.

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:45.350
LAURA: Keep an eye on your bracers, Beau.

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.360
MARISHA: I am going to watch them.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.840
LIAM: But you don't have any bracers.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.690
MARISHA: No, they're right--

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:52.110
LIAM: No, I know you do, but you don't have them.

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:53.110
MARISHA: No, I don't.

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:54.357
I do not love these.

00:52:54.357 --> 00:52:56.307
I do not have bracers.
LIAM: They're really shitty.

00:52:56.307 --> 00:52:58.405
TRAVIS: What's on the boat?

00:52:58.405 --> 00:53:00.160
MATT: Who wants to check through The Fiona?

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:04.030
SAM: Fjord, you should go check, you know boats.

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.863
TRAVIS: Yes, I do.

00:53:04.863 --> 00:53:07.260
SAM: I'll go with you because I'm (click, click)

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.093
good at this.

00:53:08.093 --> 00:53:10.120
MATT: You could either both make
individual investigation checks,

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.610
or one of you can make it with advantage.

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.032
SAM: I don't need him.

00:53:13.032 --> 00:53:15.222
(laughter)

00:53:15.222 --> 00:53:17.163
MATT: Holy shit, okay.
SAM: I'm good on my own.

00:53:18.157 --> 00:53:19.786
You can do your own, I'll do my own.

00:53:19.786 --> 00:53:21.150
TRAVIS: You don't want to do it twice?

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:21.983
SAM: Nah, you do you.

00:53:21.983 --> 00:53:23.450
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.850
If I roll higher than you this will be-- ooh.

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:27.230
It's not going to be higher, 19.

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.150
SAM: 26.
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:30.300
MATT: You guys take a moment.

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.320
It's not an extensive ship.

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.640
So, I'd say, about 20 or so minutes,

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.860
you do a pretty thorough pass of the

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.610
immediate visible regions of the ship.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:41.210
It's picked clean.

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:43.690
Like anything of worth is gone.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:44.523
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:53:44.523 --> 00:53:47.020
MATT: You see there's some basic equipment.

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:47.930
There's some nets.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:50.170
You can see maybe

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.290
some building supplies,

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.458
but it's all very basic, very...

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.393
very...

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:01.070
things that aren't worth anything.

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:03.380
TRAVIS: Fishing nets or hempen rope nets?

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:05.750
MATT: Fishing nets.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:07.750
LAURA: All of us are missing something?

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:08.583
MATT: No.

00:54:08.583 --> 00:54:10.890
LIAM: No, just the people who failed that roll.

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.080
LAURA: Understood.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.750
LIAM: I'd like to make my way over to the Eden's Horizon.

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.990
And yeah, look for stuff,

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:19.540
but I want to see how sound,

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.530
see if there's damage on the inside--

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:24.520
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: -- of the hull, all that.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.340
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll help, too.

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.380
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll all go over.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.540
Let's be honest, the ship's dope.

00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.860
MATT: So make an investigation check,

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.460
with Yasha's help you can take it with advantage

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:33.715
or you can roll individually, Yasha, up to you.

00:54:33.715 --> 00:54:37.140
ASHLEY: Go for it.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.380
LIAM: That is a 28.

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.190
MATT: Nice.

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:42.030
Looking over it, the ship is in very good shape.

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:43.410
There's some very minor damage.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.740
It looks like mostly scuffs on the sides of the hull

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.190
that you envision probably occurred

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:51.070
when it was wedging its way into this cavern originally.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:53.610
The ship is wide enough where it would just barely fit,

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:56.650
but it looks like there had been some elements of the

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:58.690
the perimeter rock

00:54:58.690 --> 00:54:59.750
through the illusion where it

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.748
scraped along the hull, but it's

00:55:02.748 --> 00:55:04.590
fairly superficial.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.682
It could probably use some fixing.

00:55:08.428 --> 00:55:10.340
The rest of the ship,

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.220
aside from the ballista weapons,

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:17.160
which are these long iron rods with points at the end

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.330
that can be loaded in,

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:20.790
anything of worth is picked clean.

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:21.710
LIAM: Except for the boat.

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:23.100
This is our ticket out of here.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:23.933
LAURA: Well, maybe.

00:55:23.933 --> 00:55:24.766
SAM: Are there sails?

00:55:24.766 --> 00:55:26.110
Haven't they been rotted away?

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:27.230
MATT: The sails are still there.

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:28.140
They're kept up.

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.070
The sails--

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.870
LAURA: Wouldn't this boat be really slow?

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:35.010
I feel like-- shouldn't we look for a fast ship?

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.270
TRAVIS: It depends on what

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.000
we want the mission to be.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.951
Speed, or defense and attack.

00:55:41.951 --> 00:55:43.880
TALIESIN: I feel like we can make that decision at a

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.300
future point.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.980
TRAVIS: Can I make my way up to the highest point?

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.120
And so that I can see the rest of the ships?

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.310
From my time in Port Damali,

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:53.580
do I recognize any of the ships?

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.942
Any names that I recognize?

00:55:55.942 --> 00:55:57.300
MATT: Um,

00:55:58.769 --> 00:55:59.977
I mean, you see a number of ships.

00:55:59.977 --> 00:56:02.210
There's-- just getting the names nearby,

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.620
you see there's one called The Mistral

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.900
that's a decent sailing ship.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.590
You see one called the Sea Banshee.

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.727
That's more of a longship that looks to be

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.710
not from around the Menagerie Coast, at the very least.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:16.860
There's one called the Drunken Mariner.

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.360
That's another fishing vessel.

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:21.600
There's a Kingfisher, which

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.850
looks to be another sailing ship.

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:26.020
This one looks to be, maybe

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.070
it does have some elements of it

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:29.610
that looked like it's seen some war time

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.760
or at least seen some battles.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.350
It has some visible damage,

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:36.540
and you could see the where the repairs were done,

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:40.330
not for aesthetic reasons, but for sheer purpose.

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.530
None of them catch your attention as anything you've seen

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:43.690
in Port Damali.

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:45.310
TRAVIS: No Tide's Breath, right?

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:46.943
MATT: No, no Tide's Breath.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.970
But the Eden's Horizon

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:52.430
is definitely the largest ship.

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:54.154
It would

00:56:54.154 --> 00:56:55.710
be the equivalent of

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.910
between a galley and a sailing ship.

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:02.640
So with the size of the sails there,

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.340
it would travel

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.970
at pace with probably the Balleater,

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:08.870
if not slightly slower.

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:10.980
But it is larger, it can carry more

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.510
and has the opportunity, if upgraded,

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:14.580
to have more firepower.

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.230
LAURA: Oh!

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:17.063
SAM: I like it.

00:57:17.063 --> 00:57:17.896
LAURA: Yeah, that sounds cool.

00:57:17.896 --> 00:57:20.542
TRAVIS: I really feel like we're not going to outrun a

00:57:20.542 --> 00:57:22.236
dragon turtle.

00:57:22.236 --> 00:57:23.850
TALIESIN: And we're probably going to have a lot of people

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:26.390
who want to leave, if everything goes to plan.

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:27.928
It's a big crew.

00:57:27.928 --> 00:57:29.700
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:30.533
TRAVIS: I'm sure they'd get

00:57:30.533 --> 00:57:32.890
more than just one ship up and running at that point.

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:34.115
TALIESIN: Sure.
TRAVIS: But yeah.

00:57:34.115 --> 00:57:36.920
MARISHA: Plus, you could totally rename it to the

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.550
Eden's Ball-rizon.

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:42.220
And it's, like, a spiritual successor.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.836
Or the--
LAURA: Yeah, I don't know,

00:57:43.836 --> 00:57:45.726
it doesn't have the same ring to it.
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:57:45.726 --> 00:57:47.910
I used the first thing that came to my head.

00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:50.372
We could totally workshop it, yeah.
LAURA: I'll think about it.

00:57:51.332 --> 00:57:52.360
MARISHA: Dope.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.988
MATT: All righty.

00:57:53.988 --> 00:57:54.860
MARISHA: Hmm. It's a tough one.

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.508
SAM: You got some more ball names over there?

00:57:56.508 --> 00:57:58.950
MARISHA: I'm working on it.

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:00.300
TRAVIS: You know, I did give the ball up.

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.380
It's actually with Caleb.

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.213
LAURA: I know.

00:58:02.213 --> 00:58:06.786
And honestly, Fjord, he's not with Uk'otoa anymore.

00:58:06.786 --> 00:58:08.002
SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.
TALIESIN: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

00:58:08.002 --> 00:58:11.220
LAURA: So it doesn't have the same ring to it, you know.

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:14.132
SAM: I've got an idea for the name, actually,

00:58:14.132 --> 00:58:17.150
if we do commandeer this ship.

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.983
I just--

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.530
DM, the name of the ship,

00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:23.080
it's not just crudely painted on,

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.510
I assume it's, like, in letters that are nailed

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:27.340
to the side or something?

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.410
MATT: Oh, on this,

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:31.640
it's actually loosely scrolled in.

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.440
It's been carved into a large piece of wood

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.890
that has been applied to the area.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:37.800
SAM: If we took that wood and chopped it up a bit,

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.840
rearranged some of the letters.

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:40.673
TRAVIS: No.

00:58:40.673 --> 00:58:42.228
SAM: No, no, it's so good.

00:58:42.228 --> 00:58:45.581
It would spell Nein Heroez.

00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:46.740
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh!

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.710
SAM: With a Z at the end.

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:50.070
MARISHA: Oh!

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.940
MATT: Like an Xbox gamer tag.

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.220
MARISHA: That's my favorite tag.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.110
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:57.480
TRAVIS: Like N-I-N-E or N-E-I-N?

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.030
SAM: It's up to us.

00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:01.331
LAURA: Aww, that's wonderful.
TRAVIS: All right.

00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:05.290
TALIESIN: I am both impressed and a little embarrassed.
LIAM: We could put a little Mountain Dew logo.

00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:07.480
SAM: And for you, Jester.

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.413
LAURA: Yeah?
SAM: There's an extra D at the end

00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:11.733
that you can do whatever you want with.

00:59:11.733 --> 00:59:13.450
LAURA: That's wonderful!

00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.973
MARISHA: Nein Heroezd.

00:59:17.665 --> 00:59:19.120
TRAVIS: Did you do that in your head?

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:21.448
SAM: No, I've been working on that for a while.

00:59:21.448 --> 00:59:23.615
(laughter)

00:59:25.496 --> 00:59:28.390
LAURA: That's lovely. Now I really want this ship.

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:29.650
TRAVIS: All right.

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:32.960
So I guess our last thing to decide is Ruins and--

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.970
Ruins, right?

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:36.020
Worth the night?

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.890
Heroes' Feast beforehand and then Ruins?

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:39.814
LAURA: Definitely.
SAM: Can we transport there?

00:59:39.814 --> 00:59:41.514
Do you guys have, you magickies?

00:59:41.514 --> 00:59:42.700
Can you get us there?

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.230
Can you turn into a fly-y thing again?

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:45.560
LAURA: Oh yeah, we can fly again today.

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.300
MATT: "After that rest we've taken,

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.660
"I can go ahead and continue to take that form

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.500
"at least twice more before I have to rest again."

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.040
TALIESIN: Perfect.
SAM: Three, four hours of flying? How long?

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.233
TRAVIS: Someone else can obviously fly with Vilya.

00:59:56.233 --> 00:59:57.400
It's quite exhilarating.

00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.180
I don't want to hog the experience.

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.013
SAM: That's all yours.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.491
TRAVIS: No, I mean, you know.

01:00:01.491 --> 01:00:03.018
SAM: It looked like you had a hoot up there.

01:00:03.018 --> 01:00:04.988
ASHLEY: Yeah, it looked like you were having fun.

01:00:04.988 --> 01:00:06.210
TRAVIS: Yeah, yes.

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:08.990
LIAM: How do we get out of here without being

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.330
catapulted into the heavens?

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:13.190
LAURA: Oh, well, I could open up--

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:14.560
I could Control Water again.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.300
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, that opened the doorway,

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.590
but we still lost a couple of our fighting women to the sky.

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:20.998
SAM: Ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:00:20.998 --> 01:00:23.361
What if we just embrace it?

01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:26.888
LAURA: (gasps) Shoot us up-- Polymorph as we go.

01:00:26.888 --> 01:00:29.184
SIRI ON SAM'S WATCH: I didn't get that.
LIAM: Have you--

01:00:29.184 --> 01:00:30.470
(laughter)

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:32.210
LIAM: Even Siri knows that's a bad idea.

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:33.470
MARISHA: That's a bad idea-- yeah.

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:35.150
LAURA: I love it. Let's do it.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:38.217
TRAVIS: Well, isn't water dripping from above?

01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:39.742
Like, couldn't we--
SAM: But those are little holes.

01:00:39.742 --> 01:00:41.210
We saw those, right?

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:43.040
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, but I don't know if they're big enough

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.531
for us to go through.
TRAVIS: But if it's volcanic

01:00:44.531 --> 01:00:45.789
and it's, like, a porus rock,

01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:48.280
could we try and make them bigger?

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.530
TALIESIN: That's a-- that seems--

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.160
I mean, like, those holes are

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.680
tiny, right?

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.630
TRAVIS: Volcanic rock can be pretty brittle.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.530
SAM: Blow up the roof?

01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.570
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I feel like--

01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:03.290
SAM: Then it will, like, hit on the Nein HeroeZ?

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:05.295
TALIESIN: Let's--

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.283
let's not mess up the camp, though.

01:01:07.283 --> 01:01:09.437
LAURA: Launching pad, launching pad!

01:01:10.322 --> 01:01:11.988
TRAVIS: A fire hydrant.
MATT: Vilya answers your questions.

01:01:11.988 --> 01:01:16.980
"I can maintain my forms for about six or so hours."

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.813
TRAVIS: Straight?

01:01:17.813 --> 01:01:20.590
SAM: But I mean, is that how long it will take to fly there?

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:23.570
MATT: "No, for flying from here to the Ruin."

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:24.816
TRAVIS: Oh, here.
TALIESIN: Map.

01:01:24.816 --> 01:01:26.100
MATT: Which you have over there.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.555
LAURA: Right there.
TRAVIS: Thanks.

01:01:27.555 --> 01:01:29.055
Watch out, cookie.

01:01:30.455 --> 01:01:33.071
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: You know, it's fine.

01:01:33.071 --> 01:01:34.886
(laughter)

01:01:34.886 --> 01:01:36.290
I have it in my notes here somewhere.

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:38.154
SAM: Oh, watch your face, watch your eyes.

01:01:38.154 --> 01:01:39.780
TRAVIS: Is the X where the--

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.613
LIAM: Yeah, but you love me.

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:41.670
TRAVIS: Where the Ruins are?

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:43.330
MATT: The X up top is where the Ruins are,

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.600
and that little path there.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.997
TRAVIS: Oh, wait, yeah.

01:01:47.164 --> 01:01:50.020
So we're going here and we're over here.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.350
MARISHA: Okay, so like--

01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:52.260
MATT: So that would go--

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.952
MARISHA: -- a quarter way?

01:01:53.952 --> 01:01:55.460
TRAVIS: It's from here to here.

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:57.440
SAM: Four inches?

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.707
TRAVIS: Three and a half.

01:01:58.707 --> 01:02:00.230
MATT: Flight--
LIAM: (wheezing laughter)

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:02.252
MATT: -- of flight, it would be about--

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:05.490
LIAM and LAURA: (wheezing laughter)

01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:06.740
LIAM: Sorry.
MATT: It's all right.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.350
I'll say a little over three hours.

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:11.183
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Looks like

01:02:11.183 --> 01:02:12.560
a little over three hours.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.393
LAURA: Oh gosh.

01:02:13.393 --> 01:02:15.451
TRAVIS: I'm Professor X.

01:02:15.451 --> 01:02:18.240
LAURA: Well, here's the thing. If I control the water

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.882
to get out of here,

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:25.400
I can't do three hours worth of Polymorph

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.510
and do a Heroes' Feast.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.050
SAM: That's why we have to use the water--

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:30.720
LAURA: We have to use it to go or else

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.830
I won't be able to do it.

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:34.230
I can only do three Polymorphs.

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.222
TALIESIN: I've got a terrible idea.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.660
Oh, you want to hear it? Okay.

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:43.750
If you turn into a big bird,

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.940
a big bird.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.600
And one at a time, catch us as we come up

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.690
and then place us back down on the

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:52.910
top of the fountain

01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:55.400
and then wait for the next one and catch us.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.930
I mean, that's only a little crazy.

01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:57.940
And then if--

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.780
and if-- who has Feather Fall?

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.613
SAM: I do.

01:03:01.613 --> 01:03:05.090
TALIESIN: Oh, so-- and if she misses you can (snaps).

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:06.560
LAURA: Yeah, so you're the first one out.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.310
TALIESIN: You're the net.

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:09.440
MARISHA: So just for clarification,

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.870
we're talking about riding the spigot up

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:14.395
to the upper level and then just walking around?

01:03:14.395 --> 01:03:16.620
Is that what you were talking about?
TALIESIN: Well, we can fly from there.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.390
LAURA: I think what we should do

01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:20.812
is we should do the Polymorphs now,

01:03:20.812 --> 01:03:23.700
snatch up everybody that's riding,

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.180
run full force--

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.650
fly full force to the waterfall.

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.820
That way we launch kind of through it and up.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.127
That way we don't risk--

01:03:31.127 --> 01:03:34.200
SAM: In bird form we're shooting up into the sky.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.310
We'd look so epic.

01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.560
LAURA: Oh my gosh, that would be so much fun.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.440
TRAVIS: Don't you think the flying creatures

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.240
will separate from the ones they're carrying?

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.415
SAM: Probably not.
LAURA: No, I'll hold on

01:03:41.415 --> 01:03:43.315
really tight, you guys.
TRAVIS: Probably not. You're right.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:47.360
MARISHA: I'm just confused as to why we need to do that.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.318
MATT: Vilya looks noticeably,

01:03:50.318 --> 01:03:51.693
extremely nervous.
MARISHA: Can't we just

01:03:51.693 --> 01:03:54.634
take a normal takeoff?

01:03:54.634 --> 01:03:55.720
LAURA: Fluffernutter!

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.391
SAM: Just think about it in slow motion, like

01:03:58.391 --> 01:04:01.070
(explosion sound effect)
MARISHA: I mean, I'm here for it.

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:02.770
I just want to know the reason.

01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:05.200
MATT: "I don't mean to interject
into your group conversation--"

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.142
TRAVIS: You really should.

01:04:07.142 --> 01:04:09.390
MATT: "I've spent quite a bit of time

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:12.340
"in various bird and avian forms."

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.860
LAURA: Yeah.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.840
MATT: "Water and flight with feathers
that could absorb liquid

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.940
"tend to not go together as well."

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.783
LAURA: Well, but...

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:24.980
MATT: "If you want to elevate--

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.010
"if you're limited on your capabilities

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:28.220
"of maintaining your form,

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.880
"we could hike around the mountain a bit to the north

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.810
"until we can get within a two hour flight distance

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:34.610
"and take us directly to the Ruin,

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:36.630
"or we could fly from here, land,

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:38.910
"and then hike the rest of the way towards the Ruin.

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:40.687
"You have to choose...

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.610
"Are you ready to spend everything you have to get there?

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:48.190
"Or if you're trying to conserve, do we want to brave--"

01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:49.023
LAURA: Not to conserve.

01:04:49.023 --> 01:04:51.520
I just want to be able to do Heroes' Feast.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.070
MATT: "Well, then we want to brave

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:55.110
"a bit of the mountain or brave a bit

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:56.550
"of the approach to the Ruin?"

01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:57.383
ASHLEY: Well.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:00.145
SAM: Or we can all just jump

01:05:00.145 --> 01:05:02.870
out through the thing at the same time.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:03.840
MARISHA: It is really fun.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.460
SAM: And I could cast Feather Fall on--

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:08.401
MARISHA: It is-- it's like Raging Waters. It's great fun.

01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:09.770
MATT: "Look, if you're looking for fun in this,

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:10.850
"I'm not going to stop you from that.

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.580
"I just think combining it with the use of a

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.380
"flight-based feathered creature would be

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.290
"not optimal."

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.280
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe we wait to do the flying

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.070
after we've already gone out and up.

01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:22.903
TALIESIN: Dried off a bit.

01:05:22.903 --> 01:05:23.736
MARISHA: So out and up--

01:05:23.736 --> 01:05:26.500
ASHLEY: It's very cool, but just in case.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.350
MARISHA: Wait, what did you just say?

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:28.670
TRAVIS: I agree.

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:30.250
ASHLEY: Maybe not waiting to fly--

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:33.593
MARISHA: Right, until after we shoot up--
ASHLEY: And then you all can get a ride.

01:05:33.593 --> 01:05:35.360
TRAVIS: Are we all holding hands and going into the geyser?

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.350
Is that what we're doing?

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:37.300
LAURA: Oh, geez Louise.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.468
ASHLEY: We can try to see if we can--

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.928
LIAM: Is the idea to link hands

01:05:40.928 --> 01:05:43.930
and get thrown willy nilly into the sky

01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:47.190
and then have some of turn into birds,

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:50.110
while I am cartwheeling into the heavens?

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:51.120
TRAVIS: I don't know.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.496
ASHLEY: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:05:53.496 --> 01:05:55.740
SAM: Caleb, you taught me Feather Fall.

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.040
We could all join hands.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.330
We all spring up together.

01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:59.560
You and me cast Feather Fall--

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.368
LIAM: I don't have that prepared today--

01:06:01.368 --> 01:06:03.198
SAM: Yeah, you do! We'll be fine.

01:06:03.198 --> 01:06:05.381
(laughter)

01:06:05.381 --> 01:06:06.523
I believe in you!

01:06:06.523 --> 01:06:08.160
LAURA: Here's the other thing, though.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.230
I mean, I'm not brilliant with

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.290
mathematics or physics or stuff,

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.340
but I feel like if we're on the inside

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.870
and it shoots us up,

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:18.660
we're not going to make it through the waterfall.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.090
So it's just going to shoot us up

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:22.730
and we're going to catch the edge of the ceiling.

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:24.110
TRAVIS: Or out.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:25.750
MARISHA: Well, I thought we had to go out,

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.060
right? And then up?

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.450
ASHLEY: What could possibly go wrong?

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:29.900
LIAM: The idea that you--

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.300
ASHLEY: I think that's the way we need to go for sure.

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:34.560
LIAM: I am pretty good with math

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.400
and the idea that you think you can predict the direction

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.100
you are going to be thrown into the sky

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:43.361
by jumping into a geyser is ludicrous.

01:06:43.361 --> 01:06:47.220
(laughter)

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.170
ASHLEY: But the thing is if we all hold hands.

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:50.850
And then we can have, like, a contest,

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:52.920
like whoever lets go loses.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.400
LIAM: Oh, she convinced me.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.429
She convinced me. I changed my mind.

01:06:57.429 --> 01:06:58.861
TRAVIS: (high-pitched laughter)

01:06:58.861 --> 01:07:00.590
MARISHA: It's high stakes Red Rover.

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:02.762
LAURA: Okay, okay, forget it.

01:07:02.762 --> 01:07:04.930
We can hike for an hour if it means

01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:06.450
saving all of our lives.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:08.010
TRAVIS: The important stuff.

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:09.570
LIAM: Just imagine.

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:14.538
Just imagine Matt killing all of us goldfish.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.653
We're all goldfish.

01:07:17.653 --> 01:07:19.087
TALIESIN: We're all going to go goldfish?

01:07:19.087 --> 01:07:20.285
MARISHA: We're basically gods at this point.

01:07:20.285 --> 01:07:21.660
MATT: I--
MARISHA: No.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:22.600
What's the worst that could happen?

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.563
MATT: -- am down for whatever you want to do.

01:07:24.563 --> 01:07:26.000
(laughter)

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.661
LAURA: I'm going to jump into the water

01:07:28.661 --> 01:07:30.900
and start swimming towards the geyser.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.850
MATT: So Jester dives in and is heading toward the geyser.

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:34.250
Do you guys follow suit?

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.183
LIAM: Nope.
MARISHA: Sure! Yeah.

01:07:36.183 --> 01:07:38.307
LAURA: I've got 10 minutes of this stupid spell.

01:07:38.307 --> 01:07:41.078
You guys better get over here.
SAM: Yeah, yeah, we're coming, we're coming.

01:07:41.078 --> 01:07:41.986
MARISHA: Wait, what spell?

01:07:41.986 --> 01:07:45.510
LAURA: I cast Control Water on the geyser and open it up.

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.380
ASHLEY: We're flying over-- swimming over.

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.790
MARISHA: So we're just exiting the cave

01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:51.267
in a safe and orderly manner, okay.

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:52.380
LAURA: As much as possible.

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.950
I'm going to control the water a little bit

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:57.580
below the surface so where it maybe

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.714
gives more of a gap

01:07:59.714 --> 01:08:01.112
for people to swim through.
MATT: Okay, yeah,

01:08:01.112 --> 01:08:02.753
now that you see the width of the cavern,

01:08:02.753 --> 01:08:04.400
you can safely put the water off to the side.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.060
So easy enough for you to do,

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.150
you watch as Jester from this side

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:12.490
divides the singular upward waterfall geyser

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:14.430
and leaves an open doorway,

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:16.460
a pathway out into the lagoon itself.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.320
And you all one by one, swim your way through safely

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.893
without having to make any saves.

01:08:21.893 --> 01:08:25.080
And you're now out into the bright day, sunlight,

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.728
a blue, nearly cloudless sky.

01:08:27.728 --> 01:08:29.390
And as you look up, you can see along the mountain

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:32.190
in the nearby jungle, that mist still hangs.

01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:35.550
But you are all are outside of the cavern safely.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:36.530
And what would you like to do?

01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:39.160
LIAM: A plan so simple it just might work.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.177
(quiet laughter)

01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:45.128
MARISHA: So fly now, walk later?

01:08:45.128 --> 01:08:47.203
Is that what we're doing?
LAURA: What's safer, do you think?

01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:51.180
MATT: "Well, the mountain is treacherous in its own right.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.460
"I don't know what creatures might be living

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.000
"on the northeastern side of it, if at all.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.880
"And it is, at some points,

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.468
"crumbly and a bit of a fall could occur.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.010
"As far as the exterior of the Ruin,

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.440
"I do not know what lies there.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.290
"I've avoided it since I've been here."

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:13.000
LAURA: Let's fly now and walk towards the Ruins.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.050
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:16.539
LAURA: That way we can know what
we're approaching as we're--

01:09:16.539 --> 01:09:17.863
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:09:17.863 --> 01:09:19.440
LAURA: We can do it stealthily.

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.780
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: I like that.

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.087
MATT: "Very well." (whooshing)

01:09:23.087 --> 01:09:25.660
And you watch as Vilya suddenly leaps from the water and

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.980
(whooshing) wings shoot out. (flapping)

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.530
LAURA: Oh god, be ready, Fjord.

01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:31.400
MATT: She's now flying above, waiting.
TRAVIS: I'm not going first.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.450
Am I going first?

01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:34.240
SAM: No, you're going with her.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.820
MARISHA: Which I think is first.

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.810
I think that is one and the same.

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:39.241
TRAVIS: I thought we were going to talk about this

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:40.970
first, though, before we did this.

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:42.740
TALIESIN: The time for talking is over.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.271
TRAVIS: I really don't know if that's ever true.

01:09:44.271 --> 01:09:47.064
(laughter)

01:09:47.064 --> 01:09:48.230
SAM: Do you want to do--

01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:49.171
MARISHA: Call back.

01:09:49.171 --> 01:09:51.000
LAURA: Do you want to do parchment--

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.767
SAM: Parchment, Boulder, Shears?

01:09:52.767 --> 01:09:54.100
LAURA: (laughing) Is that what it was?

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.573
SAM: Boulder, Parchment, Shears?

01:09:56.573 --> 01:09:57.940
TRAVIS: Who am I doing it with?

01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.245
SAM: Not me. I'm fine.

01:09:59.245 --> 01:10:00.745
ASHLEY: Well, maybe I can go with her.
LAURA: Yasha and Beau.

01:10:00.745 --> 01:10:02.378
MARISHA: I'll go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, ready?
ASHLEY: Okay, ready?

01:10:02.378 --> 01:10:03.785
TRAVIS: Wait, wait, all three of us are going?

01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:06.034
SAM: Threeway, threeway, it's threeway.

01:10:06.034 --> 01:10:07.470
ASHLEY: It feels like this is a dumb idea.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.020
TRAVIS: Yeah, threeway!
MARISHA: Maybe it should just be

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:09.853
just you two.

01:10:09.853 --> 01:10:11.470
LAURA: No, no, no.
TRAVIS: Threeway, threeway.

01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:12.881
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

01:10:12.881 --> 01:10:14.547
TRAVIS: Uh, uh, uh.

01:10:14.547 --> 01:10:16.696
MARISHA: Um.
LAURA: Oh wait.

01:10:16.696 --> 01:10:18.110
(laughter)

01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.961
ASHLEY: Wait.

01:10:18.961 --> 01:10:23.244
(laughter)

01:10:24.857 --> 01:10:26.323
TALIESIN: It's been a long week.

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:27.846
Oh god.

01:10:27.846 --> 01:10:30.290
(laughter)

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:33.186
ASHLEY: That's why it doesn't work with three people.

01:10:33.186 --> 01:10:35.189
TRAVIS: We'll just have to do it again.

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:36.122
(laughter)

01:10:36.122 --> 01:10:36.955
LIAM: I know threeways.

01:10:36.955 --> 01:10:38.805
That is not how you accomplish them.

01:10:38.805 --> 01:10:40.483
(laughter)

01:10:40.483 --> 01:10:42.521
MATT: How have you all survived to level 12?

01:10:42.521 --> 01:10:46.422
(laughter)

01:10:46.422 --> 01:10:48.033
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
LIAM: Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!

01:10:48.033 --> 01:10:50.630
(laughter)

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:52.033
TRAVIS: There's no way that happens twice.

01:10:52.033 --> 01:10:53.566
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

01:10:53.566 --> 01:10:54.420
LAURA: Try it again.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.550
TRAVIS: Ready, go.

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.360
ASHLEY: One, two, three.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.775
TRAVIS: Yes, I win!

01:10:58.775 --> 01:10:59.860
(laughter)

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.500
ASHLEY: That means you're going with her?

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.575
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going.

01:11:02.575 --> 01:11:04.074
(laughter)

01:11:04.074 --> 01:11:06.060
TRAVIS: That's how this game works. (screams)

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.168
(laughter)

01:11:07.168 --> 01:11:10.500
MATT: As Vilya's talons grasp you in the water

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.590
and pull you from the lagoon.

01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:13.646
You guys watch as Fjord

01:11:13.646 --> 01:11:15.500
begins to crest off,

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.210
ocean dripping from him below.

01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.950
SAM: Well worth it.

01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:20.557
(laughter)

01:11:20.557 --> 01:11:23.399
MARISHA: "I win, fuck you gu-- ah!"

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.006
MATT: All right.

01:11:26.006 --> 01:11:27.003
ASHLEY: Holy moly.

01:11:27.003 --> 01:11:29.560
MATT: What's the flight marching order here?

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.660
(laughter)

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:32.526
LIAM: Mixing it up!

01:11:32.526 --> 01:11:35.520
I transform and grab the lesbians and take off.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.353
MATT: All righty.

01:11:37.598 --> 01:11:39.023
TALIESIN: All right, we're apparently we're together.

01:11:39.023 --> 01:11:39.889
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

01:11:39.889 --> 01:11:42.139
MARISHA: Yasha, I'm flying.

01:11:43.233 --> 01:11:44.380
I'm really flying.

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.057
LAURA: I'm going to turn into a light blue owl today.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:49.045
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: I was going to say

01:11:49.045 --> 01:11:50.011
"You're doing it, Peter,"

01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:51.859
but that's the wrong movie.

01:11:51.859 --> 01:11:53.868
(laughter)

01:11:53.868 --> 01:11:55.416
I'm very tired.

01:11:55.416 --> 01:11:57.880
(laughter)

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.713
ASHLEY: Wait, no--

01:11:58.713 --> 01:12:00.171
TRAVIS: I'm tired now.

01:12:01.031 --> 01:12:02.750
MATT: All right, so a bright blue--

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:03.660
LAURA: A <i>light</i> blue.

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:05.350
MATT: Light blue, which bird?

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:06.702
LAURA: Giant owl.
MATT: Giant owl, okay.

01:12:06.702 --> 01:12:08.417
TRAVIS: Bangarang.
ASHLEY: I'm flying, Yasha!

01:12:08.417 --> 01:12:09.328
LAURA: Although--

01:12:09.328 --> 01:12:10.978
Yeah. Fuck it, I said it.

01:12:10.978 --> 01:12:11.936
MATT: Sure.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:13.500
LAURA: All right, Nott, get on my back.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.440
SAM: Okay.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.273
LAURA: Caduceus?

01:12:15.273 --> 01:12:18.280
TALIESIN: All right, I'm doing the thing.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.113
MATT: All right.

01:12:20.346 --> 01:12:21.179
So.

01:12:21.179 --> 01:12:22.720
LAURA: While I fly,

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.810
I'm going to hold my feet like this

01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:27.207
so Caduceus can just sit in my hands

01:12:27.207 --> 01:12:29.590
and let his feet dangle.
TALIESIN: Okay, that's much more, yeah.

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:31.507
TRAVIS: Enjoy some tea.

01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:34.720
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.553
MATT: There you go.

01:12:35.553 --> 01:12:36.660
ASHLEY: That's adorable.
TALIESIN: I have chai.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.143
MATT: All right, so as the three birds coast--

01:12:40.143 --> 01:12:41.223
TALIESIN: Pumpkin chai.

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:43.920
MATT: -- along the eastern side of the mountain,

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.220
you can see the little wisps of cloud that are above.

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.340
Just the little elements, little pockets

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:51.750
of condensation in the atmosphere shooting by

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:53.170
as you make your way around

01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:56.220
the eastern side of the island and over the volcanic edge.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.660
You can see the blackened smoke still rising,

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.145
still thick and angry as it was the night before.

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:06.140
As the first hour passes.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.115
LAURA: So dumb.

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:09.020
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.629
TRAVIS: There're aftershocks.

01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:12.237
(laughter)

01:13:12.237 --> 01:13:13.070
MATT: Oh yeah.

01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:14.745
MARISHA: That's totally what it is.

01:13:14.745 --> 01:13:16.420
(laughter)

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:17.570
ASHLEY: We're the worst.

01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:18.930
MARISHA: Oh, we're loopy.

01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:20.473
Okay, keep going.

01:13:20.473 --> 01:13:23.270
(laughter)

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:26.522
LIAM: (dramatically) Come to Critical Role
for epic adventure.

01:13:26.522 --> 01:13:31.522
(laughter)

01:13:32.122 --> 01:13:34.087
MATT: Oh no, no.

01:13:34.087 --> 01:13:35.872
Oh no.

01:13:35.872 --> 01:13:37.472
This is a problem.

01:13:38.365 --> 01:13:39.640
LIAM: We better start the show over.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.531
MATT: Yeah, I know, we got to start from the beginning.

01:13:41.531 --> 01:13:43.156
It's the only way.

01:13:43.156 --> 01:13:45.250
(laughter)

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.761
Actually, yeah, as you guys are headed--

01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:48.594
(laughter)

01:13:48.594 --> 01:13:49.585
MATT: I have to--

01:13:49.585 --> 01:13:52.310
as you head your way through the atmosphere,

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:55.577
three-- two regular owls and one light blue one.

01:13:56.816 --> 01:13:58.066
We're going to go to break.

01:13:58.066 --> 01:14:00.300
(laughter)

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.197
SAM: Descent into madness.

01:14:02.197 --> 01:14:03.780
(laughter)

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.138
MATT: Give us a moment to cool down.

01:14:06.138 --> 01:14:07.330
(laughter)

01:14:07.330 --> 01:14:08.163
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

01:14:08.163 --> 01:14:10.980
MATT: We'll see you guys back here in a few minutes.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.280
Stay tuned.

01:14:13.706 --> 01:14:14.539

into the palm of your hand.

01:15:12.277 --> 01:15:15.297
Access your character sheets and browse their stats

Even when you're offline.

01:15:17.127 --> 01:15:19.107
Choose your spells and actions

01:15:19.107 --> 01:15:20.607

01:15:20.607 --> 01:15:22.517
and find your next tale.

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:25.857
Track hit points, spell slots, conditions, and features

01:15:25.857 --> 01:15:29.677
to make playing D and D smoother than ever before.

01:15:29.677 --> 01:15:32.147
This is beyond pen and paper.

01:15:32.147 --> 01:15:34.270
This is D and D Beyond.

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:36.367
Hey critters,

01:15:36.367 --> 01:15:37.617
Laura Bailey here.

01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:40.000
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role Shop.

01:15:41.596 --> 01:15:42.757 line:20%
(smooth music)

01:15:42.757 --> 01:15:43.757 line:20%
Ooh, look at this,

01:15:43.757 --> 01:15:45.120 line:20%
look at the details.

01:15:47.747 --> 01:15:49.987
Darling, I recommend buying two,

01:15:49.987 --> 01:15:53.287
one for you and another for you,

01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:54.370
let's be honest.

01:15:56.167 --> 01:15:58.117
This is, this is a lot of stuff you guys,

01:15:58.117 --> 01:16:00.824
we have like so many cool things right now.

01:16:02.007 --> 01:16:03.357
Oh there's some more,

01:16:03.357 --> 01:16:05.510
now available in the Critical Role Shop.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.010
(grunting)

01:16:16.876 --> 01:16:17.857
(laughing)

01:16:17.857 --> 01:16:19.167
Would you look at that?

01:16:19.167 --> 01:16:20.587
I think it worked.

01:16:20.587 --> 01:16:22.627
You were right Pumat Number Three,

01:16:22.627 --> 01:16:25.007
all we had to do was invoke that subscription.

01:16:25.007 --> 01:16:28.190
Cantrip, Pumat Number Three?

01:16:31.047 --> 01:16:32.127
Oh boy.

01:16:32.127 --> 01:16:33.427
Well hello there.

01:16:33.427 --> 01:16:34.897
I'm Pumat Prime.

01:16:34.897 --> 01:16:38.927
It's good to finally join you here in the prime dimension.

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:42.937
I see this as the Twitch prime realm, I think

01:16:42.937 --> 01:16:46.537
and, oh, we're in that Critical Role channel

01:16:46.537 --> 01:16:47.415
aren't we?

01:16:47.415 --> 01:16:48.248
(laughing)

01:16:48.248 --> 01:16:49.081
Wow, would you look at that,

01:16:49.081 --> 01:16:50.502
you got chat and everything.

01:16:50.502 --> 01:16:51.335
(laughing)

01:16:51.335 --> 01:16:54.847
Respectfully I was looking for the prime rib realm,

01:16:54.847 --> 01:16:57.517
but this isn't too bad.

01:16:57.517 --> 01:16:58.350
You see,

01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:01.237
if you already have access to the Amazon Prime realm,

01:17:01.237 --> 01:17:02.837
you can get a free subscription

01:17:02.837 --> 01:17:05.677
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch prime realm.

01:17:05.677 --> 01:17:08.497
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship

01:17:08.497 --> 01:17:09.677
after that peace treaty,

01:17:09.677 --> 01:17:12.607
the prime minister signed a few years back.

01:17:12.607 --> 01:17:14.667
You just have to remember renew

01:17:14.667 --> 01:17:17.487
your Twitch prime subscription at the top of each month,

01:17:17.487 --> 01:17:18.367
respectfully.

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:21.417
And hey, if you're already a subscriber,

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:23.957
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

01:17:23.957 --> 01:17:26.707
using the gift a sub button,

01:17:26.707 --> 01:17:29.097
that is assuming the empire hasn't sent

01:17:29.097 --> 01:17:31.157
the tax man to your shop here recently.

01:17:31.157 --> 01:17:33.797
(laughing)

01:17:33.797 --> 01:17:34.647
All right, well

01:17:34.647 --> 01:17:37.497
I'll have to find that darn elusive prime rib realm

01:17:37.497 --> 01:17:40.000
who knew the prime dimension had so many pockets.

01:17:41.147 --> 01:17:42.102
Good luck.

01:17:42.102 --> 01:17:44.844
(laughing)

01:17:44.844 --> 01:17:45.927
Pumat Three!

01:17:47.367 --> 01:17:49.259
(soft music)

01:17:49.259 --> 01:17:52.950
Subscribe.

01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:53.950
Resubscribe.

01:17:56.137 --> 01:17:59.620
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.670
MATT: And welcome back.

01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:08.170
So everyone.

01:31:08.170 --> 01:31:10.768
As you make your way, as we left off.

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.780
Flying, some as birds, some as passengers

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:18.620
through the sky, over the

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:22.410
mountainous regions of the volcano of Rumblecusp.

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.100
Heading across the northern edge,

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:27.020
you come to the end of the hour-long

01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:28.710
first length of the journey, in which those

01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:31.380
who are using the spell must re-up.

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:36.380
So Jester and Caleb, I take it you spend another slot?

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.690
Are you able to spend another slot?

01:31:37.690 --> 01:31:40.280
LAURA: Yes, I'll spend a 5th-level.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.103
MATT: All righty.
LAURA: Oh!

01:31:42.103 --> 01:31:43.028
Oh yeah.

01:31:43.028 --> 01:31:44.940
Two, two, yes.

01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.520
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.680
LAURA: We get two hours of it.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.330
These are my last time I can cast it,

01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:51.230
okay, good bye.

01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:55.130
MATT: Okay, the brief stop on a somewhat shaky,

01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:59.650
but semi-safe place to take a moment.

01:31:59.650 --> 01:32:01.550
You all take a rest except for you,

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:03.103
Vilya just keeps you up there.

01:32:03.103 --> 01:32:04.880
TRAVIS: (gasping)

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.522
MARISHA: Just blood trickling down your arm.
TRAVIS: I feel ready.

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.030
MATT: You recast and then lift off once more.

01:32:13.290 --> 01:32:16.530
And as you take on this next leg of the journey,

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.850
you can begin to see from above

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.730
what you assume is where the Ruin resides.

01:32:23.730 --> 01:32:27.500
The thick dense jungle ahead of you

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:28.650
eventually gives way.

01:32:28.650 --> 01:32:32.320
You can see the trees begin to turn brown

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.680
and then begin to fall in.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:38.220
There is a region,

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:41.530
a wide grove where the jungle has just

01:32:41.530 --> 01:32:45.020
died away and is now fallen and

01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:48.550
rotting vegetation into gray,

01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:53.130
dusty, rock-filled emptiness.

01:32:53.130 --> 01:32:55.640
You can see this

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.930
texture to it at this distance.

01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:58.967
You're not quite sure what the landscape is

01:32:58.967 --> 01:33:01.317
other than the change in color.

01:33:03.170 --> 01:33:04.910
Any folks who also want to make a perception check,

01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:06.610
just in the general vicinity

01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:07.510
of the island around you.

01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:10.090
SAM: Dinosaur check, dinosaur check.

01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:12.103
MARISHA: What did you say?
LIAM: Are we still airborne?

01:33:12.103 --> 01:33:13.320
MATT: You're still airborne, yes.

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.520
MARISHA: Oh, so we get advantage on our check.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.353
MATT: You have advantage, but you have to use

01:33:16.353 --> 01:33:17.886
the modifier from your--

01:33:17.886 --> 01:33:19.670
LAURA: Yes, which is nine, yo.

01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:21.356
LIAM: Oh, I rolled terribly.

01:33:21.356 --> 01:33:23.120
LAURA: 25.

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.650
LIAM: Not worth mentioning.

01:33:24.650 --> 01:33:25.870
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:27.940
LAURA: What what, Beau again!

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:29.164
SAM: Isn't that your third one tonight?
MARISHA: Second one.

01:33:29.164 --> 01:33:30.008
SAM: Second one.

01:33:30.008 --> 01:33:31.550
MARISHA: It's on a perception check, too.

01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:33.090
TRAVIS: Fifth one tonight.

01:33:33.090 --> 01:33:34.640
MARISHA: My eighth one tonight.

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:35.473
SAM: Whoa.

01:33:36.335 --> 01:33:38.710
MARISHA: Monks are OP.

01:33:38.710 --> 01:33:40.820
MATT: So Beauregard and

01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:43.980
owl-Jester.

01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:46.270
Looking down below, you do see,

01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:48.500
as you're moving ahead,

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.400
covered mostly by the canopy, but on the

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.830
north-northwestern side of where

01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:55.580
the mountain reaches the jungle,

01:33:56.490 --> 01:33:57.990
you can barely make out what looks like

01:33:57.990 --> 01:34:00.010
some sort of a chasm

01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:04.240
or a crack in the floor of the jungle

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.020
that snakes through.

01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:07.600
You can see areas where some trees

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.450
have slightly fallen in.

01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:12.850
And it just is this darkened

01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:14.680
crevasse.

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.240
LAURA: Is it far off of where we're flying?

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.440
MATT: Correct, it's far off from where you're flying,

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:19.547
but you do notice.

01:34:19.547 --> 01:34:22.350
Just mark that as you're continuing forward.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:28.080
Towards the end of the second hour, you are getting closer

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.270
to the point that you can start making out some

01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:33.440
details in the middle of this

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:38.340
grayed space where the Ruin supposedly resides.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.890
But you're not going to be able to make it.

01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:41.640
You're going to have to stop,

01:34:43.023 --> 01:34:46.170
say about three or so miles beyond the boundary.

01:34:46.170 --> 01:34:47.040
SAM: 30 or three?

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.040
MATT: Three.
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.870
MATT: Beyond the boundary there.

01:34:51.930 --> 01:34:54.580
So eventually you begin to crest lower and lower

01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.980
with your perception checks,

01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.870
you do see in the middle of this,

01:34:57.870 --> 01:35:00.880
while the area is gray,

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.403
there was once a jungle here,

01:35:02.403 --> 01:35:04.500
or at least elements of it that has just fallen in

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.090
and petrified. Rotted, and then petrified.

01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:09.480
So a lot of the wood elements you can see

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.940
look sagged and partially sunken in,

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:12.910
and then dried.

01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:15.390
Almost like they were frozen

01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:18.120
and then left to gray.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.900
You see a number of broken buildings.

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:24.040
Maybe, like, a small village,

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.730
a very small village of some kind

01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:26.920
that it is dilapidated.

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:31.150
You can see structures that are mostly intact.

01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:34.750
And some that are just the bare bones exterior.

01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:35.920
The corners and

01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:39.720
the bare remnants of where they once stood.

01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:43.080
And there was a singular obelisk-like spire

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.730
emerging from the center of that region.

01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:48.510
Too far to make out the details of it.

01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:51.220
But there is something, a larger central structure

01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:55.340
that rises up in the center at a slight angle.

01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:57.330
TRAVIS: Anything in the air above it?

01:35:57.330 --> 01:35:59.790
MATT: Not that you can make out at this moment.

01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:01.840
ASHLEY: It's at a slight-- it's like--?

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.660
MATT: A very faint angle.

01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:06.750
But the mists that permeate to the jungle

01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:10.930
across the entire island do continue into this space.

01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:14.260
And the mists are now met with a heavy fog.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.030
A fog layer,

01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:20.363
that's why you can just make out
the various details at this point.

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.920
It is a fog-shrouded region.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.770
LAURA: Oh no.

01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:26.870
MATT: And you are coming down into the canopy.

01:36:27.730 --> 01:36:29.840
You begin to reach the point where you're going to

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.720
have to slow down a bit

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:31.830
or you're going to start whipping

01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:33.850
towards the top edges of the trees.

01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:37.680
And Vilya can keep this up,

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:39.500
but you guys have to land eventually.

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:43.640
And so after a moment, you all slowly begin to circle

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.050
and then make your way safely through the canopy,

01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:47.610
amongst the high ends of the trees,

01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:52.150
and then down, touching onto the soft jungle floor.

01:36:52.150 --> 01:36:54.120
You can hear the sound of the insects

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:55.450
and other creatures around you,

01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:58.280
the bird calls and other clicking creatures

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.880
that live in the area.

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:03.170
The soft floor meets your feet.

01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:05.080
And both of you revert back to your forms

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.690
and you are gingerly placed down by Vilya

01:37:07.690 --> 01:37:12.520
before she returns to her humanoid self.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.640
LAURA: How you doing, Fjord?

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.857
TRAVIS: Great. I am ready for more.

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:18.983
Sad to be on the ground.

01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:22.088
The air is where I belong.

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:26.010
ASHLEY: Would you like to ride on my shoulders?

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.407
TRAVIS: No.

01:37:29.407 --> 01:37:30.240
But thank you.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.090
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:37.030
LIAM: So the spire, you all saw that on the way in?

01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:38.870
SAM: Yeah, it looks promising.

01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:39.760
LIAM: Okay.

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.040
SAM: Could be something.

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.873
MARISHA: It's a word.

01:37:41.873 --> 01:37:43.230
TALIESIN: Interesting, isn't it?

01:37:43.230 --> 01:37:44.063
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:46.560
Where would it have come from?

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.470
Like a building.

01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:51.290
TRAVIS: Well, at an angle,

01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:53.957
and with everything around it dead,

01:37:53.957 --> 01:37:55.800
like a crater, almost.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.420
MARISHA: I have a feeling, yeah.

01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:58.680
LAURA: It's the shard?

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.940
MARISHA: I think this is where he crash landed.

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.550
TRAVIS: Or a reject pile or something?

01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:05.270
LIAM: Yeah, when I throw a ball of flame,

01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:07.600
it looks a little bit like that afterwards.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.750
TRAVIS: It's true.
LIAM: A little bit.

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:12.170
MARISHA: So he crash landed and
then shards from other dimensions

01:38:12.170 --> 01:38:16.480
scattered like fallout, like debris.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.510
This could be, you know, ground zero.

01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:19.750
TALIESIN: Does this look anything like,

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:21.520
like the vision I had or

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:22.800
is it too--

01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:25.200
MATT: I mean.

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.180
TALIESIN: -- odd?

01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:28.600
MATT: You didn't see any specifics other than

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.850
shards of different locations

01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:34.230
within this realm and beyond

01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:37.510
being dragged through when this entity punctured

01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:40.180
beyond the Astral Sea and landed here.

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.780
But you did not pick up specifics

01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:43.430
to the outside details.

01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:44.546
TRAVIS: And underfoot,

01:38:44.546 --> 01:38:48.410
it's just dead, earthen, no moisture?

01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:49.243
MATT: Once you're there.

01:38:49.243 --> 01:38:50.760
You haven't quite reached the perimeter.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.130
You guys are still a ways in the jungle.

01:38:52.130 --> 01:38:53.120
LAURA: We're in the jungle right now.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.290
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:55.810
MATT: Are you moving full pace?

01:38:55.810 --> 01:38:57.040
Are you moving through stealthily?

01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:57.873
What are you applying?

01:38:57.873 --> 01:38:59.200
LAURA: We should be quiet.
LIAM: Carefully, yeah.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.830
MATT: Okay, it is around noon at this time

01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:02.620
with the travel you've made.

01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.410
You're approaching noon.

01:39:04.410 --> 01:39:06.050
So you've made some decent time with the flight.

01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:08.410
MARISHA: Like a medium pace?

01:39:08.410 --> 01:39:09.243
A medium pace.

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.430
LAURA: I wish it was nighttime already

01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:13.740
so that I could sleep and get my spells back.

01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:14.573
MATT: Sorry.

01:39:15.926 --> 01:39:17.340
SAM: Yeah, medium pace.

01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:20.400
MATT: Okay, so not stealthy, just going casually.

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:23.260
SAM: Stealthy is slow. We've got three miles.

01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:24.520
TRAVIS: We're trying to get to the jungle line, right?

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:25.353
To the clearing?

01:39:25.353 --> 01:39:27.530
LIAM: Yeah, once we start to lose tree cover--

01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:28.920
I mean, I know there is a lot of fog,

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.409
but the closer we get, maybe we could slow it.

01:39:32.409 --> 01:39:34.320
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.462
MATT: Okay, what is the marching order, if you don't mind?

01:39:39.535 --> 01:39:40.840
SAM: I'll go first.

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.690
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, I'll be behind Veth.

01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:45.210
TRAVIS: Rogue's going to rogue, right?
TALIESIN: I'll be behind you.

01:39:45.210 --> 01:39:46.180
MATT: Veth and Beauregard.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:48.193
SAM: Yep, expert perception, yep.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:39:48.193 --> 01:39:50.100
LIAM: I will be behind, Caleb after Caduceus.

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.320
MATT: Caleb after Caduceus.

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.645
And it doesn't have to be a single file.

01:39:52.645 --> 01:39:55.390
I have Beauregard and Caduceus shoulder-to-shoulder.

01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:57.770
LIAM: Then I will take five

01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:58.990
or 10 feet out to the side

01:39:58.990 --> 01:40:00.360
so I have a clear line of sight ahead of me.

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.400
MATT: Right there?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.360
MATT: Okay.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.180
LAURA: I'll follow behind that.

01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:05.013
MATT: All right.

01:40:05.013 --> 01:40:06.700
TRAVIS: I'll be in the back, I suppose.

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.280
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll stay in the back with Fjord.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.180
MATT: Okay, Vilya will be coming up in the center

01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:11.396
with you, Jester.
LAURA: Okay.

01:40:11.396 --> 01:40:12.979
TRAVIS: Swords in the back.

01:40:12.979 --> 01:40:13.812
MATT: All right.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.130
Pushing through the sweltering jungle,

01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:19.690
the insects are thick,

01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:23.790
reminiscent of the mosquitoes that had

01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:25.840
pursued you when you first made it through.

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:28.240
Vilya, however, as they arrive, you watch as

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.580
she puts her hand up and creates this gust of wind

01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:32.080
that blows them back.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:34.030
As you press forward,

01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:36.220
she steps a little bit further up

01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:38.930
and begins to create this wind gust barrier

01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:40.360
to the front that keeps any insects

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.680
from flying close enough to you,

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.520
now that she's aware that it's an issue.

01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:46.480
You push forward through the jungle,

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.770
pushing past the various heavy vines and tangles.

01:40:49.770 --> 01:40:51.270
She points out a few other

01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:55.830
danger spots or familiar bits of carnivorous vegetation.

01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:58.360
The similar blood-colored vines

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:01.250
that you approached when you first arrived on the island are

01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:04.117
fairly thick in some elements of this region.

01:41:06.301 --> 01:41:09.896
Let's see, who's guiding this primarily?

01:41:09.896 --> 01:41:11.290
Who's the one who's taking point on this?

01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:12.890
Is that you, Veth?

01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:14.050
SAM: I guess so.

01:41:14.050 --> 01:41:15.750
MATT: Make a survival check for me, if you don't mind.

01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:17.280
SAM: That's me.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.310
I'm in the lead.

01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:21.136
Natural 20.

01:41:21.136 --> 01:41:22.550
(cheering)

01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:24.060
MATT: A total of?

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:24.900
SAM: 21!

01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:26.170
MATT: There we go.

01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:27.830
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:28.750
MATT: Easy enough.

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:31.230
Thankfully, you were taking stock

01:41:31.230 --> 01:41:33.240
while you were descending towards the jungle.

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:35.390
And in the brief moment before you broke the canopy,

01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:37.130
you paid attention to as many

01:41:37.130 --> 01:41:40.330
landmark trees and the general direction

01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:42.580
you had to continue to go based on the direction of the sun

01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:45.020
in a way that would make Caleb proud.

01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:48.350
And with that, you press on without veering from the path,

01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:50.200
taking the shortest route possible.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:53.280
You begin to notice the coloration of the jungle around you

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.400
begin to shift.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.160
You can see the vines are beginning to sag.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.850
The branches are beginning to slightly bow.

01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:03.230
You can see the thick lush foliage

01:42:03.230 --> 01:42:06.150
beginning to curl at the edges,

01:42:06.150 --> 01:42:07.730
begin to brown.

01:42:07.730 --> 01:42:11.600
The ground itself gives off this sweet, musky smell

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.950
of rotting vegetation.

01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:17.470
And as you continue forward, it begins to wither.

01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:20.669
LAURA: Wait, wait. Before we go fully into,

01:42:20.669 --> 01:42:22.406
like, the dead stuff.
MATT: Okay.

01:42:22.406 --> 01:42:25.230
LAURA: I'm going to use my charm of plant command.

01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:26.360
MATT: Okay.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.600
LAURA: And

01:42:29.664 --> 01:42:31.760
I forget, it's not like.

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.040
Oh, that isn't like, Speak with Plants, is it?

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:36.790
MATT: Speak with Plants is you can talk to them.

01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:39.110
LAURA: Yeah, is that basically the same?

01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:39.943
Oh, that is what it is.

01:42:39.943 --> 01:42:41.050
I Speak with Plants.

01:42:41.050 --> 01:42:41.883
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:42:41.883 --> 01:42:42.760
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:45.210
I'm going to talk to a tree.

01:42:45.210 --> 01:42:47.770
MATT: Okay, you walk up to one that's still living

01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:51.501
though it's starting to wither a little bit.

01:42:51.501 --> 01:42:55.607
LAURA: Oh, how are you feeling?

01:42:55.607 --> 01:42:56.690
Are you okay?

01:42:57.708 --> 01:43:00.567
MATT: (low-pitched and sad) "Not really."

01:43:00.567 --> 01:43:02.830
LAURA: What happened to you?
TRAVIS: I love the tree.

01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:07.830
MATT: "Ah, it's been like this for a while.

01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:09.630
"It's...

01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:10.940
"icky."

01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:13.470
LAURA: Yeah, it looks like it feels icky.

01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:15.150
MATT: "Yeah."

01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:16.680
LAURA: Oh man.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.450
Do you--

01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:22.060
you don't remember what it was that caused this?

01:43:23.604 --> 01:43:24.820
MATT: "Uh."

01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:28.553
LAURA: How many rings have you gotten since it's happened?

01:43:28.553 --> 01:43:30.500
(laughter)

01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:32.508
MATT: "I haven't looked."

01:43:32.508 --> 01:43:35.999
(laughter)

01:43:35.999 --> 01:43:37.500
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.607
MARISHA: It's Cad-spruces.

01:43:39.607 --> 01:43:42.470
TALIESIN: Aw.
(laughter)

01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:43.461
Wow.

01:43:43.461 --> 01:43:45.152
ASHLEY: Good one.
MARISHA: No.

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:47.500
(laughter)

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.200
MATT: "It's a rough place around here."

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.060
LAURA: Yeah.

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:54.120
MATT: "I'm one of the lucky ones."

01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.970
LAURA: Yeah, it looks like if you'd have been

01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:59.430
a little bit further in-- oof.

01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:00.667
Bad news bears.

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:01.620
MATT: "You're telling me.

01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:04.170
"Some of the others are losing their minds."

01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:05.003
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:44:05.003 --> 01:44:05.836
Like how?

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:11.258
MATT: "Like their minds are being lost."

01:44:11.258 --> 01:44:12.274
LAURA: Wow.

01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:15.963
What would make you feel better?

01:44:15.963 --> 01:44:17.279
Do you know?

01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:24.490
MATT: "I could move back a little bit more."

01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:26.340
LAURA: Yeah, that would be great.

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.960
I'll see what I can do about that, okay?

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.420
MATT: "Oh, that's very swell, thank you."

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:35.665
LAURA: You're welcome. Hmm.

01:44:35.665 --> 01:44:39.314
You don't remember how long you've been like this at all?

01:44:39.314 --> 01:44:42.460
MATT: "I mean, I don't know.

01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:46.150
"Better part of half a century, maybe."

01:44:46.150 --> 01:44:47.608
LAURA: That's a long time.

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:55.040
So I'll try to get it fixed for you, okay?

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.310
MATT: "I appreciate that.

01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:57.350
"That's real nice."

01:44:57.350 --> 01:45:00.990
LAURA: All right, well, see you around.

01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:03.192
MATT: "Bye."
LAURA: Bye.

01:45:04.371 --> 01:45:05.884
Ooh.

01:45:05.884 --> 01:45:07.730
Poor guy.

01:45:07.730 --> 01:45:10.310
TRAVIS: Not very, um, chipper?

01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:13.090
LAURA: No, he sounds like he is

01:45:13.090 --> 01:45:15.810
just real, you know, almost drunk, but like

01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:17.870
just ugh, like, fatigued.

01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:19.886
LIAM: The tree did?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:45:19.886 --> 01:45:21.689
LIAM: What does that sound like?

01:45:21.689 --> 01:45:24.106
LAURA: Kind of like Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:28.920
LAURA: He said it could have been, like,

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.922
around 50 years that he's been like this.

01:45:33.085 --> 01:45:34.660
SAM: Wow.

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:38.060
TRAVIS: So 25, and now potentially 50.

01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:39.370
TALIESIN: Makes you think.

01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:40.703
TRAVIS: Generations.

01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:44.670
MARISHA: I mean, it tracks, yeah.

01:45:44.670 --> 01:45:46.110
With the information that we know.

01:45:46.110 --> 01:45:49.160
LIAM: Plus trees we know now have units of measurement.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.212
MARISHA: Yeah, who fucking knew that?

01:45:51.212 --> 01:45:52.809
LIAM and TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: I mean, it makes sense.

01:45:52.809 --> 01:45:54.120
LAURA: Seasons.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.436
MARISHA: Huh?
SAM: Sure, seasons.

01:45:55.436 --> 01:45:57.050
LAURA: They can see the sun.

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:58.660
MARISHA: Yeah, and they grow rings.

01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.247
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: You know.

01:46:00.247 --> 01:46:01.597
TALIESIN: If you lost all your hair every year,

01:46:01.597 --> 01:46:03.300
I mean, you could probably keep count.

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.900
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.510
LIAM: Do you?

01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:08.700
TALIESIN: No, no, of course.

01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:09.830
I mean, I can keep count.

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:11.510
Oh, I mean, to be fair,

01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:14.777
I didn't really keep count, now that I think about it.

01:46:14.777 --> 01:46:17.550
Would have helped.

01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:19.075
Yeah, no, you got me there.

01:46:19.075 --> 01:46:20.247
LAURA: Do you know if--

01:46:20.247 --> 01:46:24.300
is there a way we can just, like, move this tree back a few?

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:27.820
Vilya, can we move this tree back a little bit?

01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:29.228
MATT: "Um...

01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:32.540
"We can try?"

01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:35.395
TRAVIS: But, Jester, aren't we trying to be a tad bit--
SAM: This is our side quest now?

01:46:35.395 --> 01:46:37.898
TRAVIS: Low impact?
LAURA: Well, it's just he's--

01:46:37.898 --> 01:46:40.930
okay, but he sounded really sad.

01:46:40.930 --> 01:46:43.040
SAM: If we solve the crisis on the island,

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.710
this won't be a problem at all.

01:46:44.710 --> 01:46:45.543
TRAVIS: Good.

01:46:45.543 --> 01:46:47.740
LAURA: That is true, that is true.

01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:48.950
MATT: "You're sure about that?"

01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:50.720
SAM: No, but I'm also like,

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.650
I don't know, it's a tree, you know?

01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:54.130
LAURA: Hey man, he has--

01:46:54.130 --> 01:46:55.660
he-- he was talking to me.

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.940
Just like you're talking to me right now, Veth.

01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.040
SAM: I don't mean to be heartless.

01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:00.990
It's just that--

01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:02.890
LAURA: Just because he can't, you know,

01:47:02.890 --> 01:47:05.000
talk to everybody or get up and walk around

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.430
doesn't mean he's any less of a person.

01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:08.800
TRAVIS: No, he's not a person.

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.511
SAM: Yeah, he's not a person.

01:47:10.511 --> 01:47:11.860
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:12.693
(snorts)

01:47:12.693 --> 01:47:14.270
SAM: All I'm saying is,

01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:17.610
I bet if you talk to each of these trees,

01:47:17.610 --> 01:47:19.640
they would have their own tree story,

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.920
their own tree past and their own tree family.

01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:22.753
LAURA: Yeah!

01:47:22.753 --> 01:47:26.410
SAM: And I think that as sad as that is,

01:47:26.410 --> 01:47:29.050
it's better to concentrate on all of them as a whole,

01:47:29.050 --> 01:47:31.360
rather than that one tree.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.193
LAURA: That's true.

01:47:32.193 --> 01:47:33.660
If we moved him back then all the other trees

01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:34.790
next to him would be really sad

01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:37.260
that they didn't get chosen to be pushed back, right?

01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.093
SAM: Yeah.

01:47:39.337 --> 01:47:40.660
TRAVIS: (snorts)

01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.843
LAURA: This is complicated.
TRAVIS: (muffled laughs)

01:47:42.843 --> 01:47:43.970
SAM: Every tree has a story.

01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:46.640
TRAVIS: I just start walking towards the--

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.570
MATT: Okay, so you guys are
progressing in the same order then?

01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:52.236
LAURA: Yes?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:47:52.236 --> 01:47:53.679
MATT: Same medium pace?

01:47:53.679 --> 01:47:56.062
MARISHA: Uh, it's starting to get a little weird.

01:47:56.062 --> 01:47:57.786
MATT: You're starting to--

01:47:57.786 --> 01:48:00.570
LIAM: Slow it down and be warier and listen.

01:48:00.570 --> 01:48:03.760
Listen for any kind of threat.

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.323
TALIESIN: Eyes peeled.
MATT: All right.

01:48:05.323 --> 01:48:06.880
So two of you who are taking point,

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.400
go ahead and roll perception checks.

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.940
And I would, once we finished that,

01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.090
I would like at group stealth check.

01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:13.040
Because you guys are slowing to a stealthy pace.

01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.070
TALIESIN: All right, perception.

01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:16.805
SAM: I guess-- oh, you guys are doing perception?

01:48:16.805 --> 01:48:17.950
LIAM: I did well.

01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:19.300
TALIESIN: I did well as well.

01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.850
LIAM: 25.
TALIESIN: 26.

01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:21.760
SAM: Oh.

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.370
MATT: All right.

01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:26.054
So you guys are keeping a pretty, pretty,

01:48:26.054 --> 01:48:28.240
a pretty intense look as you progress forward.

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:29.540
Everybody, please make a stealth check.

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:30.373
LAURA: Wait, I can--

01:48:30.373 --> 01:48:32.568
I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

01:48:32.568 --> 01:48:33.593
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:36.490
One of my favies.

01:48:36.490 --> 01:48:40.088
LAURA: And I'm going to bless Fjord.

01:48:40.088 --> 01:48:40.921
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.130
LAURA: Blessing of the Trickster.
Not like Bless blessed.

01:48:46.130 --> 01:48:47.850
TRAVIS: Blessing of the Trickster, which is what?

01:48:47.850 --> 01:48:49.748
LAURA: Advantage on stealth checks.

01:48:49.748 --> 01:48:50.581
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:58.120
Blessing of the Trickster.

01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.570
MATT: So stealth checks, Fjord.

01:48:59.570 --> 01:49:00.470
TRAVIS: 27.

01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:01.770
LAURA: Did you add 10?
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.730
LAURA: 21.

01:49:04.730 --> 01:49:05.850
LIAM: 20.

01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:08.470
SAM: 39.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:09.303
ASHLEY: 17.

01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:11.530
TALIESIN: 28.

01:49:11.530 --> 01:49:12.860
MARISHA: 25.

01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:15.276
MATT: Okay, and Vilya rolled okay.

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:17.282
ASHLEY: Yep.

01:49:17.282 --> 01:49:18.170
MATT: Pressing forward--

01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:20.348
MARISHA: Some things never change.
ASHLEY: Old habits die hard.

01:49:20.348 --> 01:49:22.349
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Evergreen.

01:49:22.349 --> 01:49:25.313
MATT: The canopy begins to have larger holes.

01:49:25.313 --> 01:49:28.698
You can see where trees have fallen and left open sky.

01:49:28.698 --> 01:49:29.789
And as you push forward further,

01:49:29.789 --> 01:49:32.927
the canopy eventually begins to fall away.

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:35.450
Caduceus and

01:49:36.610 --> 01:49:39.640
Caleb, you begin to see some movement

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.710
in the canopies as well.

01:49:40.710 --> 01:49:43.853
You see some of the leaves shake.

01:49:43.853 --> 01:49:46.110
And shift heavily.

01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:48.970
And you glance over and you see one of the trees

01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:52.690
seems to have partially uprooted itself

01:49:52.690 --> 01:49:54.790
and then step forward.

01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:57.380
Its body is gnarled.

01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:00.370
And this spreading, gray color

01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:03.910
is winding through its trunk and up through its bark.

01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:07.010
Branches themselves, some hang in this awful

01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:10.110
withered limb-like appearance,

01:50:10.110 --> 01:50:12.310
while other parts appear semi-healthy.

01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:13.910
And you can see it erratically

01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:16.420
begin step around this,

01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:20.430
large, living, awakened tree-like creature.

01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:22.530
And as it steps a few times it stops

01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:24.640
and then shakes and twitches.

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.227
LAURA: Oh, I don't like.

01:50:26.227 --> 01:50:28.445
MATT: And right as it does that, you hear this

01:50:28.445 --> 01:50:32.300
(clicking)

01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:34.530
clicking sound beginning to come from deep within

01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:36.910
a resonant hollow within its trunk.

01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:39.013
As it does two other trees

01:50:39.013 --> 01:50:41.250
(whooshing)

01:50:41.250 --> 01:50:43.077
shake (crunching).

01:50:43.077 --> 01:50:44.230
TALIESIN: I think we've got a problem.

01:50:44.230 --> 01:50:46.027
MATT: Then begin to shimmy slightly to follow it

01:50:46.027 --> 01:50:47.970
before they both stop and come to rest

01:50:47.970 --> 01:50:49.570
for a moment.

01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:52.550
Gently swaying, though no breeze finds it.

01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:53.637
They gently sway.

01:50:55.418 --> 01:50:58.730
(clicking)

01:50:58.730 --> 01:51:01.477
LAURA: Does it look like they noticed us?

01:51:01.477 --> 01:51:02.800
MATT: Nope.

01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:04.310
MARISHA: Oh.

01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:06.260
SAM: Every tree has a story.

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.750
Some are bad.

01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:12.370
MATT: They do not know you're present.

01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:15.410
You all feel pretty well hidden, at the moment.

01:51:15.410 --> 01:51:16.590
What would you like to do?

01:51:16.590 --> 01:51:18.670
SAM: Are they just standing in our path?

01:51:18.670 --> 01:51:20.660
MATT: There's one, that's a little ways to the left of you.

01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:22.120
And there's two other ones that are about

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.670
a hundred or so feet from it, different directions.

01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:28.140
You can try and do a wide circle around

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:30.550
or you could brave going between.

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:33.049
LAURA: Do they make clicking noises

01:51:33.049 --> 01:51:35.417
consistently, even if they're not moving?

01:51:36.850 --> 01:51:38.150
MATT: It's not consistent.

01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:39.128
LAURA: Okay.

01:51:39.128 --> 01:51:41.340
MATT: It goes this eerie, quiet for a while.

01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:45.060
And you can hear some of the leaves swaying a bit.

01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.850
You can hear some--
actually, at this point,

01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:48.880
the creature sounds have stopped.

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:51.610
The sounds of the various bugs, birds,

01:51:51.610 --> 01:51:54.060
other calls that you're used to in the jungle

01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.040
have gone silent.

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:56.590
And so it's just quiet.

01:51:56.590 --> 01:51:57.670
And then about every...

01:51:59.030 --> 01:52:01.590
30 seconds to every two minutes you hear

01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:02.890
nearby or distant

01:52:04.183 --> 01:52:07.770
(clicking).

01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:08.603
SAM: Oh, boy.

01:52:08.603 --> 01:52:12.340
LIAM: Do they blend in with other trees remains around them?

01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:14.920
MATT: Somewhat, and they vary as well.

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:16.560
But there is definitely

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.830
a visible sickness to them.

01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:23.560
MARISHA: Caduceus, have you ever seen anything like this?

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:25.080
TALIESIN: Just for shits and giggles,

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:26.890
I'm going to burn an Eyes of the Grave

01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:27.840
to see if these are

01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:30.126
undead constructs.

01:52:30.126 --> 01:52:31.670
SAM: Undead trees?

01:52:31.670 --> 01:52:33.240
MATT: Okay.

01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:35.140
You can stealth to get close enough

01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:36.700
to sense for it.

01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:37.660
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:38.493
MATT: Yeah.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.490
There is an undead essence to them.

01:52:44.490 --> 01:52:46.970
These trees are no longer living.

01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:48.332
SAM: Zombie trees.
MARISHA: Clickers!

01:52:48.332 --> 01:52:51.330
LAURA: Zombie fucking trees!

01:52:51.330 --> 01:52:52.440
TRAVIS: That's new.

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.110
TALIESIN: Recommend we try and just avoid these things.

01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:56.470
SAM: They can't be very fast.

01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:57.620
If we created a diversion,

01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:59.090
we could probably just run past them.

01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:00.220
TALIESIN: They can be very fast.

01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:02.075
SAM: You're talking about trees.

01:53:02.075 --> 01:53:04.060
They're made of wood, they're dead.
LAURA: Haven't you ever seen 28 Days Later?

01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:05.570
Some zombies are really fast.

01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:07.553
SAM: Did you say 28 Trees Later?

01:53:07.553 --> 01:53:09.297
(laughter)

01:53:09.297 --> 01:53:11.230
ASHLEY: We don't know how fast they can move.

01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:12.370
TALIESIN: That's a lot of assumption.

01:53:12.370 --> 01:53:15.370
TRAVIS: We really should try to go around, yeah?

01:53:15.370 --> 01:53:16.560
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, go around.

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:19.400
TALIESIN: Carts don't have legs and they're very fast.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:21.068
SAM: That is really smart.

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.330
TALIESIN: Haven't you ever noticed?

01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:24.600
SAM: Yeah.

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:27.800
TALIESIN: Ships are made of wood, they're very fast.

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:29.940
SAM: What else is fast?
TRAVIS: -- go around the danger.

01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.320
TALIESIN: Squirrels are very fast.

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:32.440
SAM: They have legs.

01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:34.460
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair.

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:35.940
Fish are very fast.

01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:36.940
SAM: They don't have legs.

01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:38.580
TALIESIN: No, they're hard to catch.

01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:40.578
SAM: Snakes-- all right, let's go.

01:53:40.578 --> 01:53:42.718
MATT: Okay. So you guys begin--

01:53:42.718 --> 01:53:43.810
TALIESIN: I'm getting into this.

01:53:43.810 --> 01:53:46.689
MATT: -- take a wide circle around these three

01:53:46.689 --> 01:53:50.670
and you make your way around the outer edge carefully,

01:53:50.670 --> 01:53:52.843
quietly, moving along.

01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:58.477
You manage to scoot past the
third one to the far right

01:53:58.477 --> 01:54:00.500
to curve around the path.

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.380
As you push past from the other trees,

01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:05.749
you hear very loudly directly above you.

01:54:05.749 --> 01:54:07.484
(clicking)
SAM: Oh.

01:54:07.484 --> 01:54:10.728
MATT: (clicking)

01:54:10.728 --> 01:54:12.502
LIAM: Hey, Abbot!

01:54:14.391 --> 01:54:18.260
MATT: The roots begin to pull out of the dry ground.

01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:20.660
You can see elements of the cracked earth

01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:22.570
begin to rise and splinter with it.

01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:25.690
And as it does, they fall into the sinkhole, left behind

01:54:25.690 --> 01:54:28.880
as one of six thick roots

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.728
begin to pull their way up.

01:54:30.728 --> 01:54:31.640
And it begins to shift forward.

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.430
You all quietly

01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:35.780
move around and keep from touching

01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:37.760
or being bowled over by them.

01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:42.710
I need everyone to make a dexterity saving throw.

01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:44.220
SAM: Ooh, snapkins.

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:45.710
MARISHA: Dex save, okay.

01:54:45.710 --> 01:54:48.003
TRAVIS: Does Pass Without a Trace give us anything?
LAURA: Nope.

01:54:48.003 --> 01:54:49.144
MATT: It does not.

01:54:52.648 --> 01:54:54.478
ASHLEY: Advantage.

01:54:54.478 --> 01:54:55.707
SAM: Advantage?

01:54:55.707 --> 01:54:56.865
ASHLEY: I get advantage on dex.

01:54:56.865 --> 01:54:58.093
MATT: Fjord.
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:00.230
LAURA: 16.

01:55:00.230 --> 01:55:03.810
LIAM: I rolled a one, but I
will use ring of evasion to succeed.

01:55:03.810 --> 01:55:04.760
MATT: All right, you've got it.

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:06.600
SAM: 24.
MATT: 24.

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:08.090
Yasha?

01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:09.500
You do get advantage on it because you can see it.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:12.410
ASHLEY: I know I rolled the same thing, 10.

01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:13.450
MATT: 10, okay.

01:55:13.450 --> 01:55:15.380
TALIESIN: 19.
MATT: Great.

01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:16.790
MARISHA: 22.
MATT: 22.

01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:18.168
And Vilya.

01:55:22.450 --> 01:55:25.880
In this extra quiet

01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:26.713
almost

01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:30.560
group dance-like series of maneuvers.

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.600
You all, making eye contact,

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:35.470
begin to duck and weave and shift

01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:37.220
between hanging roots

01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:39.160
and falling bits of vegetation,

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.390
low-hanging branches,

01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:43.753
as it steps through and around you.

01:55:43.753 --> 01:55:45.603
(cracking and moving noises)

01:55:45.603 --> 01:55:48.395
(clicking)

01:55:48.395 --> 01:55:53.007
(thudding)

01:55:53.007 --> 01:55:57.114
And begins shifting westward, leaving you all there.

01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:00.000
The hairs on the back of your neck stood up,

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.793
sweat pouring down the back of your neck.

01:56:04.410 --> 01:56:07.360
And you all slowly begin to
continue your path northward

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.220
towards the outer circle.

01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:11.351
LAURA: Did it seem like they have eyes?

01:56:11.351 --> 01:56:13.275
Do you see--?
MATT: You don't see any eyes.

01:56:13.275 --> 01:56:15.270
LAURA: Like, any kind of facial features at all.

01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:16.643
MATT: No.

01:56:16.643 --> 01:56:17.493
LAURA: Weird.

01:56:17.493 --> 01:56:18.910
MATT: And it's only when they start moving

01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:23.050
that your brain begins to look for humanoid-like shifting

01:56:23.050 --> 01:56:26.080
and that's in the way the branches sway.

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.660
It would be a creature with dozens of arms

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:31.050
and multiple legs with a tall, thin body

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:34.000
with hanging, sagging hair,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.280
that would be the leaves and bits of vines

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:37.460
hanging off of it.

01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:40.300
But once they stop moving and hold still,

01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.240
then it just becomes another tree in the vicinity.

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.180
SAM: But they all were wearing underwear.

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:45.540
MATT: Every single one of them,

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:47.620
big fans of MeUndies.

01:56:50.110 --> 01:56:52.740
Pressing forward, eventually

01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:55.420
the canopy ends.

01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:58.910
All forest cover is now gone.

01:56:58.910 --> 01:57:00.600
As all the trees before you have fallen.

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:03.070
And it is just a sea

01:57:03.070 --> 01:57:08.070
of fallen, overlapping and rotting trunks

01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:10.480
and dead vegetation.

01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:15.480
Just this textured graveyard of nature before you.

01:57:15.570 --> 01:57:18.900
And the mist begins to form into the fog.

01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:21.110
And you can just barely make out the darkened shape

01:57:21.110 --> 01:57:23.750
of that spire in the center of it.

01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:25.320
You're still moving forward stealthily?

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.345
SAM: I think so.

01:57:26.345 --> 01:57:28.410
TRAVIS: It sure feels counter to logic

01:57:28.410 --> 01:57:31.840
to move towards the thing that's radiating death.

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.247
SAM: Yeah, but that's what we--

01:57:33.247 --> 01:57:35.170
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm just stating the obvious.

01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:36.750
TALIESIN: Also, we're going to want to check out any

01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:39.510
of those buildings that are between us and it.

01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:41.380
LAURA: Are there buildings?

01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:43.160
TRAVIS: I thought there were, like, remnants of buildings.

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.940
MATT: From what you can see from that distance,

01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:47.310
there were shapes that looked like structures

01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:48.240
or parts of structures,

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:51.042
but from the distance and the--

01:57:51.042 --> 01:57:52.550
well, only because you rolled so fucking high.

01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:53.837
LAURA: ♪ From a distance. ♪

01:57:53.837 --> 01:57:57.170
MATT: With the fog as well, you could make out no detail.

01:57:57.170 --> 01:58:00.770
Just like the shadows of the shapes.

01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:03.000
SAM: ♪ God is watching. ♪

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:03.833
Sorry.

01:58:03.833 --> 01:58:05.880
MATT: So are you continuing?

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.670
At a medium pace, or at a stealthy pace?

01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:09.770
LIAM: Stealthy pace.

01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:11.000
MATT: All right, all right.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:11.980
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:13.830
MATT: So you begin to move forward.

01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:15.380
LIAM: Hunched over, creeping.

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:17.980
MATT: You are now, at this point in the journey,

01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:20.380
with walking the miles there at a stealthy pace.

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:22.160
You are now in the early afternoon.

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.980
So you're getting around two o'clock.

01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:27.857
MARISHA: And how much further does it feel like we're going?

01:58:29.131 --> 01:58:31.600
LAURA: Are we going to camp here?

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:32.440
TRAVIS: I just don't want to be here

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:34.380
when the sun goes down, I think.

01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:35.820
LAURA: How are we going to--

01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:36.653
MARISHA: How much further?

01:58:36.653 --> 01:58:38.280
MATT: You can get there in about, at this pace,

01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:41.000
about an hour, hour and a half.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.475
SAM: No problem.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:45.253
MATT: Okay.

01:58:45.253 --> 01:58:46.460
TALIESIN: We may have to retreat a little faster

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:48.080
than we came in, but--

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:48.913
LIAM: Correct.

01:58:48.913 --> 01:58:50.330
MATT: Okay.

01:58:50.330 --> 01:58:53.590
Now, going forward, because of the fallen trees,

01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:56.500
there are plenty of places where you can

01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:59.500
move and try and find ways to obfuscate yourself

01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:00.810
from being just out in the open.

01:59:00.810 --> 01:59:03.400
And the fog does help, but it is a blue sky above,

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:06.530
and it is an odd thing to see a blue sky

01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:08.860
with just small little puffs of clouds.

01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.370
It is a beautiful tropical day.

01:59:11.370 --> 01:59:16.370
And then it just comes down into this thick fog.

01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:18.770
But you move forward.

01:59:18.770 --> 01:59:21.180
I will say,

01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:24.770
pushing onward at a stealthy pace,

01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:27.660
nothing seems to

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:28.750
broach you on your journey.

01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:30.740
Nothing interrupts you.

01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:33.460
Eventually, you begin to see the shapes

01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:36.210
arriving, these outer structures,

01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:37.260
these buildings,

01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:40.048
these skeletons of

01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:45.450
homes begin to come into your vision.

01:59:45.450 --> 01:59:46.283
LAURA: Homes?

01:59:47.150 --> 01:59:48.310
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:49.960
MATT: You can see

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:56.260
some appear to be collapsed

01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.070
abodes,

01:59:58.070 --> 02:00:00.637
buildings of pale stone.

02:00:02.692 --> 02:00:04.450
LAURA: There's going to be so many dead people.

02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:08.040
MATT: If anybody here is proficient in history,

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:10.273
go ahead and make a history check.

02:00:11.984 --> 02:00:12.817
LIAM: Come on.

02:00:13.687 --> 02:00:15.562
SAM: One of us? There's two of us.

02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:18.950
LIAM: 16.
MATT: 16.

02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:21.580
MARISHA: 17.
MATT: 17, okay.

02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:24.350
Looking at these buildings, what elements you can make out.

02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:26.710
They are not of Dwendalian make.

02:00:26.710 --> 02:00:28.650
They are not of Concordian make,

02:00:28.650 --> 02:00:31.302
nor are they of Dynasty make.

02:00:31.302 --> 02:00:32.880
So-- the Clovis Concord.

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:33.770
SAM: Oh yeah.

02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:35.800
MATT: So these--

02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:38.550
Elements of it

02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:40.184
remind you of Rosohna.

02:00:40.184 --> 02:00:42.992
Or at least the ruins on the outside of Rosohna

02:00:42.992 --> 02:00:44.625
and the Ghostlands.

02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:48.060
That's the closest thing you can

02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:49.460
equate them towards.

02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:54.360
There are similarities to that heavy, heavy ruined area

02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:57.510
that resides beyond the city of the Dynasty.

02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:02.965
And that's all you know on that.

02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:06.530
ASHLEY: Similarity, what's--
TRAVIS: Which is also a wasteland.

02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:08.370
ASHLEY: What's the heavy ruined area?

02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:10.880
TRAVIS: It was up north of Xhorhas,

02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:12.330
it was, like, a barren wasteland.

02:01:12.330 --> 02:01:16.420
It's where we were chasing you and Obann.

02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:18.180
LIAM: I'm going to keep my eyes peeled, too,

02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:21.688
for any kind of writing, even if I don't--

02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:24.040
MATT: Okay, make a perception check for me.

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:24.873
LIAM: Okay.

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:28.513
18.

02:01:29.370 --> 02:01:30.203
MATT: Okay.

02:01:31.230 --> 02:01:34.798
Now, as you guys continue onward--

02:01:34.798 --> 02:01:38.263
My playlist order got messed up here,
so I'm relearning everything.

02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:42.970
The air itself

02:01:42.970 --> 02:01:43.803
is growing cold.

02:01:43.803 --> 02:01:46.470
Similar to that first

02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:48.580
strange pocket of the jungle that you encountered

02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:50.840
when Vilya was leading you towards the mountain,

02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.840
but colder still, the closer you travel through these Ruins.

02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:59.490
You notice sheets of ice forming

02:01:59.490 --> 02:02:02.870
on the edge of some of these stone structures.

02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:04.880
You begin to see your breath

02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.373
merge with the mist and fog around you.

02:02:08.690 --> 02:02:10.650
It is quite cold

02:02:10.650 --> 02:02:14.118
the further and further you move towards the center.

02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:19.580
And as you step into this broken element of

02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:21.960
the remnants of some fallen structure,

02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.541
parts of stone

02:02:23.541 --> 02:02:26.280
and possibly what were once upper floors now

02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:29.860
scattered into broken rock around you,

02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:34.843
the shape begins to emerge of the center spire.

02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:37.937
You notice it is

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.673
a tower.

02:02:39.673 --> 02:02:41.913
It is a built tower.

02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:45.186
Part of one.

02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:49.180
The tower itself is not angled,

02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:52.697
but only part of the tower is here.

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:55.640
You can see where it would be built.

02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:00.590
This perfect continuously

02:03:00.590 --> 02:03:02.050
kind of--

02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:03.540
what am I'm looking for--

02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:05.260
every layer of this tower grows smaller

02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:06.340
and taller as it goes,

02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:09.920
this escalation of structure,

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.760
but it looks sheared at a perfect angle.

02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:16.710
Like it was carved from top to bottom, perfectly.

02:03:16.710 --> 02:03:19.740
Like some god had cut it with an axe and as such,

02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:21.800
it is just at an odd angle.

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:26.470
LIAM: Sliced and taken away?

02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:28.546
SAM: So it's not leaning, it's straight--
MATT: It's not leaning.

02:03:28.546 --> 02:03:31.300
SAM: -- it's just been diagonally bisected.

02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:33.660
MATT: And it's only part of a tower.

02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:36.626
Meaning there is a much larger tower

02:03:36.626 --> 02:03:39.000
and this is just a small section of it

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.510
that's been carved away.

02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:43.490
MARISHA: It's a little slice of the Abyssal Plane.

02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:47.040
TRAVIS: Is the line, like, sharp or jagged?

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.930
MATT: The line, from what you can see from this far,

02:03:49.930 --> 02:03:51.897
it looks pretty sharp.

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:56.180
You and you,

02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:59.408
Caduceus and Beauregard,

02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:05.368
hear what you think are whispers.

02:04:06.330 --> 02:04:07.163
Voices.

02:04:08.050 --> 02:04:09.260
MARISHA: You hear that?

02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:11.090
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave.

02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:12.290
MATT: Okay.

02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:15.550
Part of it,

02:04:15.550 --> 02:04:17.330
as you first hear them,

02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:19.620
some of it seems to be Common.

02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:21.760
Some of it is another language.

02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:24.010
Anyone here understand or speak Infernal?

02:04:24.010 --> 02:04:25.260
LAURA: Yes!

02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:27.140
MARISHA: Yes, get it, tiefling, yes!

02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:30.740
MATT: You do not hear the whispers yet, unfortunately.

02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:33.310
But if you point it out to her,

02:04:33.310 --> 02:04:34.894
she can begin to listen in.

02:04:34.894 --> 02:04:37.380
TALIESIN: Does anyone else hear that?

02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:38.640
LAURA: Hear what?

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.181
TALIESIN: It's, like, a

02:04:40.181 --> 02:04:42.590
(whispering sounds)

02:04:42.590 --> 02:04:43.720
MATT: You begin to hear--

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:44.910
SAM: Muppets?

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:47.758
MATT: -- in Common, phrases that resemble,

02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:51.828
"Your warmth

02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:55.980
"is ours."

02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:56.840
SAM: What is ours?

02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:58.514
ALL: Your warmth.

02:04:58.514 --> 02:04:59.583
SAM: Ugh.

02:04:59.583 --> 02:05:01.050
(laughter)

02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:06.050
MATT: "Oracs demands our return."

02:05:06.841 --> 02:05:08.100
MARISHA: Oracs?

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:10.869
MATT: Oracs demands our return.

02:05:10.869 --> 02:05:12.300
TRAVIS: Oracs?

02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:14.150
LAURA: Is that his name?

02:05:14.150 --> 02:05:16.100
TRAVIS: How would one spell such a name?

02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:17.543
MATT: O-R-A-C-S.

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:20.000
LAURA: O-R-A-C-S.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.691
LAURA: You, Jester

02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:26.772
pick up in Infernal.

02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:30.730
"Broken

02:05:30.730 --> 02:05:33.760
"and taken.

02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:38.570
"Displaced,

02:05:38.570 --> 02:05:41.745
"we suffer."

02:05:41.745 --> 02:05:43.169
LAURA: We suffer.

02:05:43.169 --> 02:05:45.531
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

02:05:45.531 --> 02:05:47.572
MATT: As you guys stand in the midst of these Ruins

02:05:47.572 --> 02:05:49.605
and you use Eyes of the Grave.

02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:54.730
There, there, there, there.

02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:59.633
You are surrounded by

02:05:59.633 --> 02:06:01.362
five.

02:06:04.670 --> 02:06:06.253
LAURA: What's going on?

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.600
TALIESIN: Do you want to talk,
or do you want to make this ugly?

02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:14.120
MARISHA: I think we should talk.

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:17.050
TALIESIN: We have things to offer you.

02:06:17.050 --> 02:06:18.583
More than warmth.

02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:25.820
MATT: You begin to see, out of the fog, as they swirl,

02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:28.740
you see a face and it's gone.

02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:29.660
TRAVIS: <i>In</i> the fog?

02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:31.710
MATT: In the fog.
LAURA: Ooh, creepy.

02:06:31.710 --> 02:06:36.557
MATT: Another hand and the profile of a

02:06:36.557 --> 02:06:38.808
woman's face (gasps)

02:06:38.808 --> 02:06:42.840
and then vanishes in the mist around you.

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:46.680
Ahead of you, towards where the base of the tower shape is,

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:48.871
something from the shadow seems to emerge.

02:06:48.871 --> 02:06:51.971
You watch as darkened, billowing, black clouds

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:54.880
You watch as darkened, billowing, black clouds

02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:59.795
of lightless mist begin to unfold and roll out as tendrils

02:06:59.795 --> 02:07:01.720
as something rises from it.

02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:03.380
You can see a humanoid form,

02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:06.590
its shoulders coming to these hooked points.

02:07:06.590 --> 02:07:09.100
Tattered bits of shroud and black sackcloth

02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:11.240
hanging from the edges of its wrists.

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:13.510
You see a blade dangling

02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:16.770
from one hand and a skeletal face folds up

02:07:16.770 --> 02:07:19.587
from the inside of it. "(gasping)"

02:07:19.587 --> 02:07:21.340
LAURA: Can I speak Infernal to it?

02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:22.360
MATT: If you'd like to.

02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:24.450
LAURA: I'm going to speak Infernal and say:

02:07:24.450 --> 02:07:26.841
Let us get you home.

02:07:26.841 --> 02:07:29.059
MARISHA: Yes!

02:07:29.059 --> 02:07:32.240
MATT: "How?"

02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:33.928
SAM: Good question.

02:07:35.690 --> 02:07:38.081
MARISHA: Tell him, fuck Vokodo.

02:07:38.081 --> 02:07:39.560
MATT: I'm going to go ahead

02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.852
and ask you guys to roll initiative.

02:07:40.852 --> 02:07:44.050
(yelling)

02:07:44.050 --> 02:07:47.020
SAM: This frightening combat is sponsored by Dwarven Forge.

02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:49.190
Get ready to journey out into the wildlands,

02:07:49.190 --> 02:07:51.400
Dwarven Forge's eighth terrain Kickstarter

02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:55.080
launching Sunday, August 9th, join the mailing list.

02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.042
dwarvenforge.com/wildlands.

02:07:58.042 --> 02:08:01.520
TRAVIS: What the fuck? Look at that!

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.353
SAM: That's a big tower.

02:08:02.353 --> 02:08:04.730
That's way bigger than I thought it was.

02:08:04.730 --> 02:08:06.240
MARISHA: So is it from the Astral Sea

02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:08.430
or is it from, like, one of the layers of Hell?

02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:09.870
LIAM: I think a layer of Hell.

02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:10.703
MARISHA: Is this like--

02:08:10.703 --> 02:08:11.690
SAM: I thought we were going to see

02:08:11.690 --> 02:08:13.774
fucking dinosaurs over here.

02:08:13.774 --> 02:08:15.350
MARISHA: Yeah, this is a slice of the City of Dis

02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:16.183
or something, right?

02:08:16.183 --> 02:08:18.460
LIAM: Yeah, this is just, like, one side of a tower--

02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:20.080
MARISHA: A hundred percent, yeah.

02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:21.740
LIAM: And everybody that was in it, is here.

02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:23.590
MARISHA: Is here, and pissed off.

02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:24.830
Well, okay, wait.

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:25.930
Oracs.

02:08:25.930 --> 02:08:27.780
LAURA: Who's Oracs?

02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:29.600
LIAM: It's a Dr. Seuss character.

02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:30.890
MATT: Make a history check.

02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:33.132
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: Can any of us do that?

02:08:33.132 --> 02:08:34.910
Before initiative?

02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:36.536
MATT: I'll allow it.
LIAM: 21.

02:08:36.536 --> 02:08:37.694
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, hang on.

02:08:37.694 --> 02:08:39.227
That was my initiative.

02:08:40.463 --> 02:08:42.670
Okay, 19.

02:08:42.670 --> 02:08:45.470
MATT: 19, does not ring a bell.

02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:46.953
LIAM: 21 either?
LAURA: 21.

02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:49.162
TRAVIS: 21 doesn't do it?

02:08:49.162 --> 02:08:50.630
SAM: Deep knowledge.
MATT: Nope.

02:08:50.630 --> 02:08:52.170
SAM: Hidden, hidden mysteries.

02:08:52.170 --> 02:08:53.712
LIAM: Old magic.

02:08:54.570 --> 02:08:56.338
TRAVIS: What about Scaro?

02:08:57.620 --> 02:08:59.480
SAM: Ooh, that's it backwards?

02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:00.313
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:09:00.313 --> 02:09:03.080
SAM: Definitely, everyone talks backwards in Hell.

02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:04.513
That's right.

02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:07.322
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Why does that sound familiar?

02:09:07.322 --> 02:09:08.155
SAM: Scaro?

02:09:08.155 --> 02:09:10.827
TRAVIS: It sounds like Orcus, Horn of Orcus, but--

02:09:10.827 --> 02:09:12.281
LIAM: Orthax, a little bit.

02:09:12.281 --> 02:09:13.543
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:09:13.543 --> 02:09:14.963
ASHLEY: But the--

02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:18.140
MATT: 25 to 20?

02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:19.070
TRAVIS: Do you remember it?
MARISHA: 22.

02:09:19.070 --> 02:09:20.460
MATT: 22.

02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:23.020
ASHLEY: No, I don't think so.

02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:24.447
SAM: Oh, 21.

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.000
MATT: Okay.
SAM: 21.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.710
MATT: 20 to 15.

02:09:30.710 --> 02:09:32.712
TALIESIN: 17.
ASHLEY: 17.

02:09:32.712 --> 02:09:34.228
MARISHA: Oh, wow.

02:09:36.663 --> 02:09:39.280
SAM: What can I do against dead people?

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.080
TALIESIN: Need magic.

02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:45.050
MATT: 15 to 10.

02:09:45.050 --> 02:09:47.187
LAURA: 13.
MATT: 13.

02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:49.985
MARISHA: Shit.

02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:54.743
MATT: Ten to five.

02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:58.100
LAURA: Uh-oh.

02:09:58.100 --> 02:09:59.590
MATT: Five to one?

02:09:59.590 --> 02:10:01.030
Three?
TRAVIS: Four.

02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:02.597
MATT: Okay.

02:10:02.597 --> 02:10:04.305
TRAVIS: (nervous noise)

02:10:08.010 --> 02:10:09.730
MATT: All right, top of the round.

02:10:09.730 --> 02:10:11.979
Actually, because I can do this now.

02:10:11.979 --> 02:10:13.337
SAM: Ooh.

02:10:13.337 --> 02:10:15.076
The foggy foggies.

02:10:15.076 --> 02:10:16.890
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:10:16.890 --> 02:10:18.248
TALIESIN: Oh, I've been missing this.

02:10:18.248 --> 02:10:19.640
MATT: Been a while.

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.640
TRAVIS: Light up my body with that smoke, bitch.
LAURA: I'm warm and I'm cold at the same time.

02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:28.050
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:10:28.050 --> 02:10:30.150
MARISHA: I don't think I have anything to try and negotiate

02:10:30.150 --> 02:10:31.730
with these people.

02:10:31.730 --> 02:10:32.670
TRAVIS: Why would you negotiate?

02:10:32.670 --> 02:10:33.694
LAURA: They're so angry.

02:10:33.694 --> 02:10:34.527
MARISHA: They're so mad.

02:10:34.527 --> 02:10:36.620
TALIESIN: I think that maybe they're part of the people

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:37.610
looking for Vokodo.

02:10:37.610 --> 02:10:38.443
I don't know.

02:10:38.443 --> 02:10:42.140
MARISHA: Well, that's the thing like--
TRAVIS: Can you banish one of them back to their plane?

02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.680
LAURA: Don't want to waste it.
MARISHA: Fight Vokodo with us?

02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:45.560
LAURA: Well, no, I can't do shit because I don't have any

02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:46.970
4th- or 5th-level spells left.

02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:48.410
TALIESIN: Do you have Turn Undead?

02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:50.368
TRAVIS: Why not? Why'd you get rid of them?

02:10:50.368 --> 02:10:51.461
(fake laughter)

02:10:51.461 --> 02:10:53.980
MATT: All righty. So top of the round is Beauregard.

02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:56.080
As you can now see all these shapes

02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.000
coming out of the mist around you,

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.280
what are you going to do?

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.260
TALIESIN: Oh my god, look at that.

02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:01.380
TRAVIS: It's so dope.

02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:02.940
It's so great.

02:11:04.338 --> 02:11:06.040
What happens if we do this?

02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:06.873
MARISHA: Is this--

02:11:06.873 --> 02:11:08.990
is there, like, a big baddy up in front of me

02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:10.860
that I'm seeing? Is that a big baddy?

02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:12.490
Who looks the beefiest?

02:11:12.490 --> 02:11:13.960
MATT: This is the one that you saw

02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:18.160
that evoked these black tendrils of shadow

02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:19.470
amongst the mist and fog.

02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:22.770
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:11:22.770 --> 02:11:24.740
Yeah, let's go for him, I guess.

02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:26.852
SAM: We're just attacking?

02:11:26.852 --> 02:11:29.180
MARISHA: What else do I got?
LAURA: We rolled initiative.

02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:31.900
SAM: Yeah, but they haven't done anything towards us.

02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:33.190
She just asked a question.

02:11:33.190 --> 02:11:34.770
They haven't answered.

02:11:34.770 --> 02:11:36.078
ASHLEY: Nice.

02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.180
LAURA: It's true.

02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:40.855
MATT: Kids.

02:11:40.855 --> 02:11:41.788
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: These are

02:11:41.788 --> 02:11:45.163
hell spawn that are going to fuck our shit up.

02:11:45.163 --> 02:11:46.125
LAURA: It's up to you, Beau, go for it.

02:11:46.125 --> 02:11:49.040
SAM: Every tree has a story.

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.820
MARISHA: Those trees would fucking
murder us and you know it.

02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:53.951
I'm going to fucking punch this guy in his face.

02:11:53.951 --> 02:11:55.708
SAM: Don't ghost punch yet.

02:11:55.708 --> 02:11:57.940
TRAVIS: Will your finger indicate again where

02:11:57.940 --> 02:11:59.860
the wraith, not the main dude.

02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:02.520
MATT: There, there, there, and there.
TRAVIS: One, two, three, and four.

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:03.900
Okay, so five total.

02:12:05.730 --> 02:12:07.080
MATT: Beauregard, what are you doing?

02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:10.490
MARISHA: Punching him in his face.

02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:12.732
SAM: Ghost punch.
MARISHA: Ghost punch!

02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:15.200
MATT: Moving straight through.

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:17.510
MARISHA: Last time I tried to negotiate with a spooky thing,

02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:19.170
It fucking...

02:12:19.170 --> 02:12:20.003
didn't work.

02:12:22.533 --> 02:12:23.449
LAURA: You learned your lesson.

02:12:23.449 --> 02:12:25.105
SAM: That was hardly a negotiation.
MARISHA: Yeah, it was!

02:12:25.105 --> 02:12:26.763
SAM: You mocked it from behind it.

02:12:26.763 --> 02:12:29.232
MARISHA: But it didn't work, am I right?

02:12:29.232 --> 02:12:30.450
It didn't work.

02:12:30.450 --> 02:12:34.355
SAM: "Ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm sad." That's how I negotiate.

02:12:34.355 --> 02:12:35.960
MARISHA: I tried to empathize,

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:38.970
and I'm done empathizing with ghosts.

02:12:38.970 --> 02:12:40.855
ASHLEY: Ooh, he's scary.
TRAVIS: Go with what you know.

02:12:40.855 --> 02:12:41.874
LAURA: Yeah, no he's scary.

02:12:41.874 --> 02:12:42.916
MATT: Okay, go for it, Beauregard.

02:12:42.916 --> 02:12:45.923
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: That bastard did not want to negotiate.

02:12:45.923 --> 02:12:47.448
MARISHA: Pop pop.

02:12:49.890 --> 02:12:51.890
That first pop is a 26.

02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:54.440
MATT: That hits.
MARISHA: Second pop is a 17.

02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:56.690
MATT: Both hit.

02:12:56.690 --> 02:12:57.523
MARISHA: Okay.

02:12:59.270 --> 02:13:02.205
MARISHA: Using my fists to punch with ghosts.

02:13:02.205 --> 02:13:03.181
TALIESIN: Between the two of us--

02:13:03.181 --> 02:13:04.014
SAM: Two clerics?

02:13:04.014 --> 02:13:05.372
MARISHA: First one is eight damage.

02:13:05.372 --> 02:13:06.838
LIAM: You can turn in the same turn.

02:13:06.838 --> 02:13:08.163
MARISHA: Second one is also eight damage.

02:13:08.163 --> 02:13:09.719
SAM: We could convince them to help us.
MARISHA: So 16 total.

02:13:09.719 --> 02:13:11.090
Stunning Strike on that first one.

02:13:11.090 --> 02:13:11.923
TRAVIS: There you go.

02:13:11.923 --> 02:13:14.246
MARISHA: For my second. I should've
stunning struck him first.

02:13:14.246 --> 02:13:15.454
MATT: That'd be--

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:18.800
LIAM: Can you stun a ghost?
MATT: 17?

02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:21.180
MARISHA: Save.
MATT: Save, okay.

02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:22.920
MARISHA: But Stunning Strike on the second.

02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:24.601
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Pop, pop.

02:13:24.601 --> 02:13:26.384
LAURA: You can stun a ghost?
LIAM: Can you stun? That's my question.

02:13:26.384 --> 02:13:28.102
MATT: That is a 20.

02:13:28.102 --> 02:13:29.591
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Apparently not.

02:13:29.591 --> 02:13:30.755
LIAM: Well, we just haven't found out yet.

02:13:30.755 --> 02:13:31.588
TRAVIS: Two ki points.

02:13:31.588 --> 02:13:32.438
MATT: So your first two strikes.

02:13:32.438 --> 02:13:34.090
LIAM: I think the answer is no.

02:13:34.090 --> 02:13:35.250
MARISHA: A Flurry of Blows.

02:13:35.250 --> 02:13:37.160
MATT: All right, two more strikes, go for it.

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:38.826
LAURA: Is it landing? Are you hitting him?

02:13:38.826 --> 02:13:40.330
MARISHA: I'm hitting him.
MATT: Yeah.

02:13:40.330 --> 02:13:41.850
Monks can punch ghosts at a certain level.

02:13:41.850 --> 02:13:42.720
And she is doing it.

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:44.380
MARISHA: My fists are magic.

02:13:44.380 --> 02:13:47.730
LIAM: Ki, fists wrapped in ki.

02:13:47.730 --> 02:13:49.912
MARISHA: Okay, a-pop pop.

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:53.797
Yikes, yikes!

02:13:53.797 --> 02:13:54.723
A one and a two!

02:13:54.723 --> 02:13:55.648
LAURA: Oh no.

02:13:55.648 --> 02:13:57.110
MARISHA: So 11 and 12.

02:13:57.110 --> 02:13:58.310
MATT: Both miss.

02:13:58.310 --> 02:14:00.360
So with the first two strikes, you could see

02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:03.430
the shaded undead, spectral creature,

02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:07.160
looking over and talking to Jester in Infernal.

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.870
You rush up and punch it twice.

02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:11.720
As both impacts hit its chest,

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:13.420
you see the mist around it swirl

02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:15.530
and the shadow spikes for a second.

02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:18.258
The inside of its dark sockets suddenly burn bright red.

02:14:18.258 --> 02:14:19.091
LAURA: Uh-oh.

02:14:19.091 --> 02:14:20.720
MATT: And it (gasping)

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:21.553
back towards you.

02:14:21.553 --> 02:14:26.480
You swing two more times and it moves around each fist.

02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:28.122
Like it's not even there.
MARISHA: I'm going to say:

02:14:28.122 --> 02:14:30.172
Fuck Vokodo, am I right?

02:14:31.927 --> 02:14:33.809
MATT: (rasping roar)

02:14:33.809 --> 02:14:35.635
MARISHA: See? They can't be negotiated with.

02:14:35.635 --> 02:14:38.360
(laughter)

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.305
MATT: Veth, it's your turn.

02:14:39.305 --> 02:14:43.070
SAM: Well, I guess my options are limited.

02:14:43.070 --> 02:14:46.400
MARISHA: No, you can try and talk to it.

02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:50.050
SAM: So I will take a few steps to my left.

02:14:50.050 --> 02:14:50.883
MATT: All right.

02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:53.320
Two, three.

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.550
SAM: Well, you know what, I'll fire first then I'll step.

02:14:55.550 --> 02:14:57.870
So I will take out a bit of fur,

02:14:57.870 --> 02:15:02.450
rub it on my bolt and cast Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt.

02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:03.283
MATT: All righty.

02:15:03.283 --> 02:15:05.710
SAM: Then I will fire my bolt

02:15:05.710 --> 02:15:08.810
at the creature that's engaged with Beauregard.

02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:10.053
MATT: Go for it.

02:15:10.053 --> 02:15:11.847
LIAM: "I rub some fur on the bolt."

02:15:11.847 --> 02:15:12.972
SAM: Natural one.

02:15:12.972 --> 02:15:14.600
LAURA: Oh no!

02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:17.302
SAM: So it shoots me.
MATT: Yes.

02:15:17.302 --> 02:15:19.670
(groaning)

02:15:19.670 --> 02:15:22.920
SAM: Yeah, so it's not just six points of damage.

02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:24.590
It's 4d6.

02:15:24.590 --> 02:15:26.820
MATT: Correct, because you shot
yourself with your own spell.

02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:29.390
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:30.947
SAM: Not a great start.

02:15:32.347 --> 02:15:33.555
LAURA: I think he loved it.

02:15:33.555 --> 02:15:35.552
SAM: 11 points of damage. (yelps)

02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.852
TRAVIS: Good, good, good.

02:15:37.852 --> 02:15:39.710
ASHLEY: That's a side effect of it not working?

02:15:39.710 --> 02:15:42.248
SAM: If I roll a one with this particular weapon,

02:15:42.248 --> 02:15:43.820
it will misfire.

02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:46.361
I also just made it way more powerful.

02:15:46.361 --> 02:15:47.243
MATT: Yes.

02:15:47.243 --> 02:15:49.470
Yes, it's beautiful.

02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:50.680
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:52.300
ASHLEY: Cool cool.
TRAVIS: Good spell.

02:15:53.188 --> 02:15:55.670
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was great.
TRAVIS: That was the worst.

02:15:55.670 --> 02:15:57.740
SAM: So yeah.
TRAVIS: Fun as long as you don't roll--

02:15:57.740 --> 02:15:59.114
LIAM: Cellphone.

02:15:59.114 --> 02:16:00.587
SAM: I don't know what to do now.

02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:02.940
I guess I'll--

02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:04.090
TRAVIS: Act like you're dead.

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:08.148
SAM: I'll hide-- nope.

02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:10.430
I've got nothing.

02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:12.220
I will tactical retreat.

02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:13.053
Tactical retreat!

02:16:13.053 --> 02:16:14.340
I'm going backwards.

02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:15.380
MATT: You're going backwards?
All right, where are you going?

02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:16.440
TRAVIS: Into the one that's behind you?

02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:18.370
SAM: No, between the two that are behind us.

02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:20.523
LAURA: Just straight into the building.
MATT: Over here?

02:16:20.523 --> 02:16:21.850
SAM: Yeah. Yeah.

02:16:21.850 --> 02:16:23.303
LIAM: Oh boy.
MATT: Full movement?

02:16:23.303 --> 02:16:24.502
LIAM: That's a great spot to be.
SAM: Sure!

02:16:24.502 --> 02:16:26.365
TRAVIS: Splitting the enemy.

02:16:26.365 --> 02:16:27.971
LAURA: What are you doing?

02:16:27.971 --> 02:16:29.046
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, now go in the tower!

02:16:29.046 --> 02:16:30.547
Go in the tower!

02:16:30.547 --> 02:16:32.370
Maybe there's an off switch to this nightmare.

02:16:32.370 --> 02:16:33.960
MATT: That ends Veth's turn.

02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:38.860
The other spectral creatures are next.

02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:40.987
TRAVIS: Just the only ones on the map, right?

02:16:40.987 --> 02:16:42.410
TALIESIN: Oh, darn. Ah.

02:16:42.410 --> 02:16:44.343
Why did you-- ah! No.

02:16:46.238 --> 02:16:48.830
MATT: This one is going to move up to Yasha.

02:16:48.830 --> 02:16:50.660
This one's going to move up to Fjord.

02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:54.540
This one is going to move up to Beauregard.

02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:57.440
And this one is going to move up to Caduceus.

02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:03.480
I need Yasha, Fjord, Beauregard, and Caduceus

02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:06.043
to all make charisma saving throws for me.

02:17:06.043 --> 02:17:07.358
ASHLEY: Wonderful.
MARISHA: Shit.

02:17:07.358 --> 02:17:08.420
LAURA: Fuck.
MARISHA: Not good!

02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:09.753
TRAVIS: Nipples on a horse.
MARISHA: Charisma?

02:17:09.753 --> 02:17:10.845
LAURA: Fucking fuck.

02:17:10.845 --> 02:17:11.884
LIAM: Oh no.

02:17:11.884 --> 02:17:12.924
TRAVIS: 20.

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:14.482
MARISHA: Oh <i>no</i>.

02:17:14.482 --> 02:17:17.110
Ooh, okay, okay. 16.
SAM: Charisma saves.

02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:18.527
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Nine.

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:21.905
MATT: And Yasha?

02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:25.090
TRAVIS: What did you do, what did you do?

02:17:25.090 --> 02:17:29.420
ASHLEY: I rolled a four and I get a minus one, so a three.

02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:30.253
MATT: Okay.

02:17:31.248 --> 02:17:33.430
TALIESIN: You're going to have to Turn Undead real quick.

02:17:33.430 --> 02:17:34.530
MARISHA: Yeah, help?

02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:37.541
ASHLEY: Why did I roll that?

02:17:37.541 --> 02:17:39.690
TRAVIS: Why are you taking them away?

02:17:39.690 --> 02:17:40.531
MARISHA: Who are you taking?

02:17:40.531 --> 02:17:41.531
LIAM: Because they're possessed.

02:17:41.531 --> 02:17:42.807
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

02:17:42.807 --> 02:17:44.590
MARISHA: No. Way.

02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:48.530
MATT: You watch as two of these creatures suddenly

02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:51.360
jump into Yasha's torso and she tenses

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:53.090
as it vanishes inside,

02:17:53.090 --> 02:17:55.890
her whole body tenses and pulls back and then--

02:17:55.890 --> 02:17:57.580
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:17:57.580 --> 02:18:00.190
ASHLEY: I'm just an empty shell of a person.

02:18:00.190 --> 02:18:01.890
MATT: Caduceus, you try and resist,

02:18:01.890 --> 02:18:03.910
but before you can go for the symbol of the Wild Mother,

02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:05.670
you see it leaps into your throat

02:18:05.670 --> 02:18:07.130
and goes through your mouth,

02:18:07.130 --> 02:18:08.630
and for a second you tense,

02:18:08.630 --> 02:18:11.360
and pull back before your arms go limp to the side.

02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:14.210
And you stand there.

02:18:15.736 --> 02:18:17.270
ASHLEY: Gerd derm it.
MATT: And your consciousness

02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:19.560
is removed and you're now watching yourself

02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:21.100
puppeted from within.

02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:23.835
MARISHA: This is adding to Yasha's complex.

02:18:23.835 --> 02:18:25.110
MATT: Both Beauregard and Fjord,

02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:26.226
you do manage to--

02:18:26.226 --> 02:18:28.089
LIAM: Susceptible.
MATT: -- shunt them off,

02:18:28.089 --> 02:18:30.310
resist their attempt to push into your body

02:18:30.310 --> 02:18:31.999
and as such, they

02:18:31.999 --> 02:18:35.548
shriek and re-present themselves.
TRAVIS: Not today, Satan!

02:18:35.548 --> 02:18:37.631
(laughter)

02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:41.278
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: ♪ Get thee behind me! ♪

02:18:41.278 --> 02:18:43.630
MATT: So that ends their go.

02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:45.960
It's now Caduceus and Yasha's turn.

02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:46.793
SAM: Oh no.

02:18:48.810 --> 02:18:51.190
MATT: With that, Yasha turns around

02:18:52.470 --> 02:18:54.530
towards you, Jester.

02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:55.920
LAURA: Yep.

02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:00.077
MATT: And Caduceus is going to go ahead and

02:19:00.077 --> 02:19:02.700
turn

02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:04.166
towards Vilya.

02:19:05.550 --> 02:19:06.950
I need you to make an attack

02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:08.600
with your blight staff.

02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:09.433
TALIESIN: Gotcha.

02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:14.078
LAURA: "Blight"? Blight?

02:19:15.523 --> 02:19:17.140
TALIESIN: That's a

02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:19.220
12.

02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:20.630
MATT: A 12?

02:19:20.630 --> 02:19:22.102
That misses.

02:19:22.102 --> 02:19:24.608
TALIESIN: I'm not good with my stick.

02:19:24.608 --> 02:19:25.900
MATT: So as you turn around

02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:29.000
and swing your blight staff towards Vilya,

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.490
she pulls back

02:19:30.490 --> 02:19:33.470
and two of the vines from her leg whip out

02:19:33.470 --> 02:19:34.910
and deflect it off to the side.

02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:35.743
No impact.

02:19:36.610 --> 02:19:39.772
Yasha, I need you to make two attacks against Jester.

02:19:39.772 --> 02:19:41.040
LAURA: No, Yasha, fight it.

02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:43.020
TRAVIS: Is this something you're going to make saves against

02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:44.270
or do we have to hit you?

02:19:45.570 --> 02:19:46.796
LAURA: Fight it!

02:19:46.796 --> 02:19:47.764
ASHLEY: We'll find out.

02:19:47.764 --> 02:19:48.930
We'll use the same dice.

02:19:48.930 --> 02:19:49.763
Okay, good.

02:19:51.390 --> 02:19:53.248
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:55.690
16.

02:19:55.690 --> 02:19:56.523
LAURA: No.

02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:58.730
ASHLEY: Okay, second attack.

02:20:00.146 --> 02:20:01.546
That was a little beter.

02:20:01.546 --> 02:20:02.920
That's 19.

02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:04.521
LAURA: 19 is my armor class.

02:20:04.521 --> 02:20:05.590
MATT: So go ahead and roll your damage.

02:20:06.541 --> 02:20:07.607
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:20:07.607 --> 02:20:08.515
TRAVIS: You just punched her, right?
LAURA: I'm looking at you

02:20:08.515 --> 02:20:10.680
dead in the eyes as it's happening.

02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:11.868
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:17.040
ASHLEY: I rolled snake eyes.

02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:18.772
LAURA: Oh, good.

02:20:18.772 --> 02:20:20.720
ASHLEY: Six total.

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.920
Or wait, no, I'm so sorry.

02:20:23.425 --> 02:20:25.153
Yep.
TRAVIS: That seems low.

02:20:25.153 --> 02:20:26.750
LAURA: It does.
ASHLEY: It does seem low, doesn't it?

02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:28.016
TRAVIS: But you're not raging.

02:20:28.016 --> 02:20:28.849
ASHLEY: I'm not raging.

02:20:28.849 --> 02:20:29.682
MATT: Correct.

02:20:29.682 --> 02:20:31.170
LAURA: So six points of damage?

02:20:31.170 --> 02:20:32.930
ASHLEY: Six points of damage.

02:20:32.930 --> 02:20:33.763
MATT: All right.

02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:36.940
So as Yasha is just, like, dead stare,

02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:38.460
slamming the blade into you,

02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:40.450
you're pushing off the shield and one

02:20:40.450 --> 02:20:42.380
gets you on the edge of the shoulder.

02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:43.213
Impact pain.

02:20:43.213 --> 02:20:45.200
You look back up and it's still that dead expression

02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:46.916
in her face.
ASHLEY: My heart's not into it.

02:20:46.916 --> 02:20:48.341
MATT: Aww.
ASHLEY: You can tell.

02:20:48.341 --> 02:20:50.890
MATT: All right, finishing their go,

02:20:50.890 --> 02:20:53.843
it is now the shadow creature's turn.

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:56.413
TALIESIN: Cool.

02:20:57.518 --> 02:20:58.801
MATT: The shadow creature,

02:20:58.801 --> 02:21:01.580
the red piercing eyes angrily stare at Beauregard

02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:03.970
who came fist first toward it.

02:21:03.970 --> 02:21:06.160
It is going to go ahead and attempt

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:09.640
to take its blade and swing towards you with one strike.

02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:10.473
MARISHA: Right.

02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:14.461
MATT: Ooh, that's a 25 to hit.

02:21:14.461 --> 02:21:16.039
MARISHA: Yep, that hits, yep.

02:21:16.039 --> 02:21:18.030
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:20.070
MARISHA: Should have done Patient Defense, yep.

02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:22.229
MATT: 11 points of slashing damage.

02:21:22.229 --> 02:21:23.295
MARISHA: Okay.

02:21:23.295 --> 02:21:24.749
MATT: As well as

02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:30.030
15 points of necrotic damage.

02:21:30.030 --> 02:21:32.088
MARISHA: So wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.

02:21:33.210 --> 02:21:34.043
Wait, wait.

02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:36.460
11 and then 15.

02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:37.293
MATT: Correct.

02:21:37.293 --> 02:21:40.688
MARISHA: So 26 total.

02:21:40.688 --> 02:21:42.460
MATT: And then with it's other hand it's going to

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.717
attempt to push.

02:21:48.530 --> 02:21:50.050
20. Does that hit?

02:21:50.050 --> 02:21:50.910
MARISHA: No, it does not.

02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:52.000
MATT: Does not.
MARISHA: 21 is my armor class.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.540
MATT: With its other hand is it pulls back,

02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:56.680
you watch black energy swirl around the forearm

02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:59.820
and it thrusts it forward to try and reach into your chest.

02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:01.260
MARISHA: I've seen this, I've seen this!

02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:04.030
MATT: And as you do, you just deflect it out of the way.

02:22:04.030 --> 02:22:06.530
No purchase found.

02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:08.960
TRAVIS: What does that do?

02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:09.793
TALIESIN: Damn.

02:22:09.793 --> 02:22:11.820
SAM: Maybe because there's no heart to grab.

02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:14.160
MARISHA: Yeah, I know better than anyone.

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:16.990
MATT: It's going to attempt to shift back.

02:22:16.990 --> 02:22:18.905
You do get attack of opportunity on it.

02:22:18.905 --> 02:22:20.560
MARISHA: Ooh, pop.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:22.030
MATT: Go for it.

02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:23.960
MARISHA: 24.

02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:25.780
MATT: 24 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:29.040
MARISHA: And Sentinel, he is not moving.

02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:32.180
MATT: Correct, so he does not-- he is not able to

02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:33.700
merge with the terrain.

02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:35.633
MARISHA: 11 damage.
LIAM: Oh, nice.

02:22:35.633 --> 02:22:37.070
MATT: All righty.

02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:39.797
MARISHA: And-- nope.

02:22:39.797 --> 02:22:40.710
You go.

02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:44.820
MATT: Okay, that finishes his go.

02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:48.430
So now, as two of your allies have been possessed,

02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:50.770
the two other ghostly creatures,

02:22:50.770 --> 02:22:53.430
still wandering through the mists,

02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:54.470
haunting around you.

02:22:54.470 --> 02:22:57.436
The shadow creature trading blows with Beauregard,

02:22:57.436 --> 02:22:59.410
its eyes now burning red with anger.

02:22:59.410 --> 02:23:01.545
It is Jester's turn.

02:23:03.102 --> 02:23:04.450
LAURA: I'm going to look at Yasha.

02:23:04.450 --> 02:23:07.720
Then I'm going to hold up my symbol of the Traveler and say:

02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:09.686
Oh, help me right now.

02:23:09.686 --> 02:23:11.700
And then I'm going to cast Turn Undead.

02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:13.016
MATT: Okay.

02:23:14.290 --> 02:23:16.850
And at this level, what does that do?

02:23:16.850 --> 02:23:18.790
LAURA: Uh, Destroy Undead--

02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:20.770
MATT: At what CR challenge rating?

02:23:20.770 --> 02:23:22.907
LAURA: Destroy Undead is

02:23:24.119 --> 02:23:26.950
level two or lower destroys.

02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:28.540
MATT: Okay, does not destroy.

02:23:28.540 --> 02:23:31.010
So that's wisdom saves?

02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:32.140
LAURA: Yes.

02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:34.229
MATT: You got it.

02:23:34.229 --> 02:23:36.898
So, for Yasha

02:23:36.898 --> 02:23:39.110
that is a fail.

02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:41.040
Caduceus, that is a fail.

02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:41.873
LAURA: Oh, good.

02:23:41.873 --> 02:23:44.380
MATT: The one next to Beauregard

02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:46.560
is a fail.

02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:49.507
The one that is currently next to Fjord is

02:23:49.507 --> 02:23:50.340
a fail.

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:51.510
SAM: Does that mean they all die?

02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:53.210
LAURA: No, that means they have to flee.

02:23:53.210 --> 02:23:54.090
LIAM: Flee from Jester.

02:23:54.090 --> 02:23:55.585
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:23:55.585 --> 02:23:58.420
MATT: So you watch as-- I mean, it's not their turn yet.

02:23:58.420 --> 02:24:01.650
But immediately, the two that had taken possession

02:24:01.650 --> 02:24:03.550
of your friends are--

02:24:03.550 --> 02:24:06.160
SAM: Oh wow, that's great.
MATT: -- shunted out of the bodies

02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:08.150
of your allies and now--

02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:10.270
you see them now reeling as Jester stands there,

02:24:10.270 --> 02:24:11.310
clutching her symbol.

02:24:11.310 --> 02:24:13.660
You've seen the burst of

02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:16.640
divine resonant, Wild Mother energy

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:19.070
radiate from Caduceus on a few occasions like this.

02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:21.190
For Jester, it's unique.

02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:23.480
You, for a brief second, watch

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:26.620
as if these faint shadows of a green cloaked figure,

02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:28.590
appear next to the ghosts and tap them on their shoulders

02:24:28.590 --> 02:24:30.847
and go, "Boo!"

02:24:30.847 --> 02:24:32.250
And all the ghosts go (shriek)

02:24:32.250 --> 02:24:35.030
and begin to flee or preparing themselves to run

02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:36.790
from Jester, who now you can see

02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:38.790
this shimmering green cloak around her as well,

02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:40.750
like she herself is within

02:24:40.750 --> 02:24:45.163
this spectral image of the Traveler himself.

02:24:45.163 --> 02:24:46.738
LAURA: I got goosebumps.

02:24:46.738 --> 02:24:47.754
MATT: That's your action.

02:24:47.754 --> 02:24:49.130
You still have your movement and bonus, if you'd like.

02:24:49.130 --> 02:24:50.438
ASHLEY: That's so cool.

02:24:51.930 --> 02:24:53.071
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:53.950 --> 02:24:55.757
Two got hurt.

02:24:55.757 --> 02:25:00.330
I guess for my bonus action-- is anybody hurt?

02:25:00.330 --> 02:25:01.830
TALIESIN: Beau.

02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:02.988
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Beau?

02:25:02.988 --> 02:25:05.770
MARISHA: I'm okay, though, but I'll take it.

02:25:05.770 --> 02:25:09.057
LAURA: I don't know if I have it prepared.
SAM: I mean, I shot myself in the face.

02:25:09.057 --> 02:25:11.700
LAURA: Hold on, hold on. Oh, I do.

02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:13.470
Hmm, it's not that much,

02:25:13.470 --> 02:25:17.260
but I'm going to cast a Healing Word at Beau.

02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:19.110
MARISHA: Fuck yes.

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:21.750
LAURA: So that's a 1d4, sorry.

02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:23.310
MARISHA: Nope, I'll take it.

02:25:23.310 --> 02:25:25.813
LAURA: Oh, that's four plus five, so nine points.

02:25:25.813 --> 02:25:26.960
MARISHA: Yes.

02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:28.953
Yep.

02:25:31.410 --> 02:25:33.430
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Dope.

02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:34.988
MATT: All righty.

02:25:34.988 --> 02:25:35.922
So that finishes your turn, Jester?

02:25:35.922 --> 02:25:37.470
Are you going to stay put or are you going to move?

02:25:37.470 --> 02:25:38.650
LAURA: I'm going to stay where I am.

02:25:38.650 --> 02:25:41.200
MATT: All right, finishing Jester's
go. That brings us to Fjord.

02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:42.710
Caleb, you're on deck.

02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:47.240
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to summon the sword and ignite it.

02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:48.720
MATT: All right.

02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:52.903
TRAVIS: And I'm going to take two swipes against the

02:25:52.903 --> 02:25:55.960
ghostly shit fuck that's right behind me.

02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:57.110
MATT: All righty.

02:25:58.470 --> 02:26:00.000
TRAVIS: That's a 20--

02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:02.060
30 to hit.

02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:02.910
MATT: That hits!

02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:05.270
TRAVIS: Okay, and second one.

02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:07.860
Is also a 30 to hit, both a 19.

02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:08.890
MATT: Damn.

02:26:08.890 --> 02:26:09.723
TRAVIS: Which is crazy.

02:26:09.723 --> 02:26:12.807
LAURA: Yeah, did the main one
have to make a save against me?

02:26:12.807 --> 02:26:13.900
The big shadow guy.

02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:15.260
MATT: The big one is--

02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:16.140
no, it is within radius.

02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:18.970
So yeah, he will make one as well.

02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:21.486
He-- does an 18...?

02:26:21.486 --> 02:26:23.153
LAURA: He succeeded.
MATT: He does it.

02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:27.602
TRAVIS: 17...

02:26:29.109 --> 02:26:32.573
26 plus...

02:26:35.717 --> 02:26:37.458
28, 30.

02:26:37.458 --> 02:26:40.590
30 total points of slashing damage.

02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:42.199
MATT: Very nice.

02:26:42.199 --> 02:26:44.897
The blade-- as the blade lights up and you strike

02:26:44.897 --> 02:26:45.730
twice against it,

02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:48.340
you watch as it carves through parts of its spectral form.

02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:50.810
It shivers and shakes and shrieks,

02:26:50.810 --> 02:26:52.700
as it begins to pull away.

02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:56.540
I believe it does get to make a save against your--

02:26:56.540 --> 02:26:57.958
LAURA: Turn Undead? It does?

02:26:57.958 --> 02:26:58.940
MATT: I think when it--
LAURA: If it gets damage?

02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:01.620
MATT: If it takes damage.
TALIESIN: Yeah, when it takes damage.

02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:02.453
MATT: It succeeds.

02:27:02.453 --> 02:27:04.310
So that one is no longer fleeing right there.

02:27:04.310 --> 02:27:05.300
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:07.561
LAURA: That's okay.
MATT: But it is wounded.

02:27:07.561 --> 02:27:09.440
TRAVIS: Did we call that out and I just wasn't listening?

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:10.273
Okay.

02:27:10.273 --> 02:27:11.597
TALIESIN: That's just how Turn Undead works.

02:27:11.597 --> 02:27:13.790
TRAVIS: Got it. With my bonus action,

02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:15.990
can I cast Hexblade's Curse

02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:19.510
on the shadow creature?

02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:21.029
MATT: Yes, you may.

02:27:21.029 --> 02:27:21.862
LAURA: Yeah.

02:27:21.862 --> 02:27:23.900
MATT: Now you watch...

02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:25.850
normally you're used to seeing the curse

02:27:25.850 --> 02:27:27.210
apparate through nearby shadow.

02:27:27.210 --> 02:27:30.080
This creature is made of pure shadow.

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:32.400
And instead you see these faint,

02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:37.400
glowing, green-like tendrils that form into vines,

02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:39.340
but still very dark

02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:43.280
and oil-slicked vines

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.260
that begin to tear up and wrap around it.

02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:46.350
And as that--

02:27:46.350 --> 02:27:47.930
that is essentially the apparition

02:27:47.930 --> 02:27:48.980
of your Hexblade's Curse.

02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:52.090
The Wild Mother now focusing your attention

02:27:52.090 --> 02:27:55.148
and the blessing of your weapon upon that entity.

02:27:56.495 --> 02:27:57.861
Does that finish your go?
TRAVIS: It does.

02:27:57.861 --> 02:28:00.902
MATT: All right. Caleb, you're up.

02:28:00.902 --> 02:28:02.210
LIAM: Yeah.

02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:05.410
So we've had a lot of experience

02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:07.410
with people being possessed or taken over.

02:28:07.410 --> 02:28:08.770
And I don't know the nature of these things,

02:28:08.770 --> 02:28:11.140
but rather than letting them take over me

02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:12.380
and really hurting somebody,

02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:14.230
I'm just going to unload

02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:16.580
Disintegrate now into the creature

02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:18.563
in front of Beauregard.

02:28:18.563 --> 02:28:21.210
So lodestone comes out,

02:28:21.210 --> 02:28:25.002
dust flies through the air, and here come all the d6s.

02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:27.530
MATT: So it's a dexterity saving throw?

02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:28.363
LIAM: Yeah.

02:28:28.363 --> 02:28:29.196
MATT: Okay.

02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:32.875
Wow, that is a 21.

02:28:34.451 --> 02:28:35.790
LIAM: 24,

02:28:37.499 --> 02:28:41.308
(counting)

02:28:41.308 --> 02:28:42.410
40.

02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:43.900
80 total, so 40--

02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:45.180
MATT: So 40 points of--

02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:46.300
TRAVIS: Jesus.

02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:48.016
SAM: 80?
TRAVIS: Eight-zero?

02:28:48.016 --> 02:28:50.888
LAURA: Oh, that's amazing.

02:28:50.888 --> 02:28:53.943
MATT: So as you aim your ray,

02:28:53.943 --> 02:28:56.726
it strikes it and you can see where the green tethers

02:28:56.726 --> 02:28:59.130
that wrap around it for the Hexblade's Curse,

02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:01.540
the impact causes the shadow

02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:03.130
to turn gray and ashy.

02:29:03.130 --> 02:29:05.850
Parts of its body almost seem to become physical

02:29:05.850 --> 02:29:07.362
and then crumble away as it

02:29:07.362 --> 02:29:08.490
(gasping moan)

02:29:08.490 --> 02:29:10.640
recoils in severe pain.

02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:12.198
That's a pretty heavy hit on it.

02:29:12.198 --> 02:29:13.620
LIAM: Yeah.

02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:15.400
And then I will use my movement

02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:17.833
to go crawl up on the stones

02:29:18.700 --> 02:29:20.347
diagonally from Caleb.

02:29:20.347 --> 02:29:21.180
MATT: Over here?

02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:23.870
LIAM: Yeah, up onto the rock even.

02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:25.853
MATT: There you go.
LIAM: And cower.

02:29:25.853 --> 02:29:28.230
MATT: Okay. Cowering done.

02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:29.063
All right.

02:29:29.063 --> 02:29:30.830
At this point, you still hear the voices

02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:33.500
encircling the space, saying things like,

02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:36.158
"Left here.

02:29:36.158 --> 02:29:38.467
"Hungry.

02:29:38.467 --> 02:29:42.870
"Never returning.

02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:45.603
"Taken."

02:29:45.603 --> 02:29:46.910
Beau, it's your turn.

02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:48.467
MARISHA: Okay.

02:29:48.467 --> 02:29:49.784
LAURA: These pour souls.

02:29:49.784 --> 02:29:53.200
MARISHA: Yeah, real sorry, man.

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:54.507
Pop pop.

02:29:54.507 --> 02:29:56.510
(laughter)

02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:58.217
I feel-- we're so mad.

02:29:58.217 --> 02:29:59.435
SAM: Di-Beau-macy.

02:29:59.435 --> 02:30:03.253
(laughter)

02:30:03.253 --> 02:30:05.302
MARISHA: That's good, that's good. Pop pop.

02:30:05.302 --> 02:30:06.342
TRAVIS: Good good, pop pop.

02:30:06.342 --> 02:30:08.070
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good.

02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:10.910
16 and 21.

02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:12.270
MATT: The 21 hits.

02:30:12.270 --> 02:30:13.570
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:30:13.570 --> 02:30:14.450
LIAM: By the end of the campaign,

02:30:14.450 --> 02:30:16.395
Marisha only says pop.

02:30:16.395 --> 02:30:18.990
MARISHA, LIAM, TRAVIS, and MATT: Pop pop! Pop pop!

02:30:18.990 --> 02:30:20.780
SAM: It means, like, it's Smurf.

02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:22.720
You know, it means whatever you want to.

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:25.160
MARISHA: Snarf snarf snarf.

02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:26.690
MARISHA: 18-- or sorry, sorry.

02:30:26.690 --> 02:30:28.090
Eight, eight damage.

02:30:28.090 --> 02:30:29.400
MATT: Eight points of damage, all righty.

02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:30.410
MARISHA: A Stunning Strike.

02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:32.427
MATT: All righty.

02:30:32.427 --> 02:30:34.093
That's cocked.

02:30:35.690 --> 02:30:37.511
MATT: 21.
TRAVIS: Damn.

02:30:37.511 --> 02:30:39.640
MATT: This guy's rolling really high on these saves.

02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:40.850
Natural 18 on that one.

02:30:40.850 --> 02:30:41.993
LIAM: Look at the smile on that--

02:30:41.993 --> 02:30:42.826
TRAVIS: Look at these ki points.
MATT: Yeah!

02:30:42.826 --> 02:30:43.801
(laughter)

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:45.136
MATT: I'm so used to Stunning Strike

02:30:45.136 --> 02:30:46.350
wrecking my guys.

02:30:46.350 --> 02:30:47.270
And it's like, when they roll high,

02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:48.350
I'm like, yeah, that's right.

02:30:48.350 --> 02:30:49.867
You show that monk.

02:30:51.921 --> 02:30:53.660
LAURA: Don't let her get away with this.

02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:55.690
MATT: That's your first hit.

02:30:55.690 --> 02:30:56.910
MARISHA: Patient Defense-- huh?

02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:57.743
MATT: Patient Defense?

02:30:57.743 --> 02:30:59.205
MARISHA: Yep.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

02:30:59.205 --> 02:31:00.104
All right.

02:31:00.104 --> 02:31:01.970
You go into a defensive stance.

02:31:01.970 --> 02:31:02.880
That ends your go.

02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:04.670
Veth, you're up.

02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:06.290
SAM: Redo.

02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:09.160
Going to cast Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt.

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:11.502
LAURA: You can do it!
ASHLEY: Let's do it, let's do it! Come on.

02:31:11.502 --> 02:31:13.395
SAM: Rev up my old--

02:31:13.395 --> 02:31:15.660
LAURA: Oh my god, if you do this again.

02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.952
SAM: Going to run over towards that

02:31:17.952 --> 02:31:20.830
post over there and slide and fire.

02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:24.730
As I disappear behind it at the big boss.

02:31:24.730 --> 02:31:26.321
MATT: You got it.

02:31:26.321 --> 02:31:27.689
SAM: (groans)

02:31:27.689 --> 02:31:29.007
MARISHA: Oh no!

02:31:29.007 --> 02:31:30.150
SAM: 16?

02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:31.510
MATT: 16 just misses it.

02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:33.850
(groaning)

02:31:33.850 --> 02:31:35.433
TRAVIS: Just missed it.

02:31:35.433 --> 02:31:38.020
LAURA: It was the slide that did it.

02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:39.727
SAM: Goddamn it!

02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:42.990
MATT: Sorry, buddy.

02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:44.590
SAM: It's all good. That's all I got.

02:31:44.590 --> 02:31:46.440
LAURA: You don't get a bonus attack?

02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:48.754
SAM: The bonus is charging it up.

02:31:48.754 --> 02:31:49.587
LAURA: Oh.

02:31:49.587 --> 02:31:50.870
MATT: Yeah, all right that finishes Veth's go.

02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:52.590
LIAM: You have to rub it really fast with fur

02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:54.354
to give it a static charge.

02:31:54.354 --> 02:31:56.527
(laughter)

02:31:56.527 --> 02:31:57.702
SAM: I could carry a balloon around.

02:31:57.702 --> 02:32:00.520
MATT: None of the ghosts recharge their possession ability.

02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:02.810
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good.
TALIESIN: They'd have to run anyway.

02:32:02.810 --> 02:32:04.520
MATT: I know, but, but there's
a chance that they recharge it.

02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:08.130
LAURA: Oh, okay.
MATT: It's going to flee,

02:32:08.130 --> 02:32:10.110
40 feet,

02:32:10.110 --> 02:32:11.979
and hover up to here.

02:32:13.337 --> 02:32:14.978
ASHLEY: Damn it.

02:32:14.978 --> 02:32:16.390
MATT: Over to this direction.

02:32:16.390 --> 02:32:19.040
LAURA: You wanted to hit it?

02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:21.200
MATT: You do get attack opportunity against them.

02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:23.125
LAURA: No, but don't hit it, don't hit it.
ASHLEY: Don't hit it.

02:32:23.125 --> 02:32:25.200
LIAM: That's the one that Fjord already tagged isn't it?

02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:26.950
TRAVIS: The one he's got in his hand now.

02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:30.910
SAM: How are you going to tell Yasha not to hit something?

02:32:30.910 --> 02:32:32.300
That's all she does.

02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:33.820
ASHLEY: I know.

02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:37.000
MATT: And this one does flee over to here.

02:32:38.770 --> 02:32:41.140
LAURA: Oh good. See, there's one still there.

02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:43.900
MATT: The one that's right there is going to use its...

02:32:44.930 --> 02:32:45.790
Okay.

02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:46.710
So the ghost is next to you.

02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:47.760
After you strike it,

02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:49.918
it turns back to you and you see this, like,

02:32:49.918 --> 02:32:51.720
this younger

02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:54.090
warrior female in spectral form.

02:32:54.090 --> 02:32:55.668
This, like, thick hooked armor

02:32:55.668 --> 02:32:57.248
look at you and--

02:32:58.373 --> 02:32:59.550
(roars)

02:32:59.550 --> 02:33:04.550
The body shifts into this terrifying demonic scream.

02:33:04.900 --> 02:33:07.890
Its whole body stretches in this nightmarish scenario.

02:33:07.890 --> 02:33:08.780
LAURA: Yeah.

02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:10.992
MATT: Yeah, straight up, straight up.

02:33:10.992 --> 02:33:12.480
All right I need <i>everybody</i>--

02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:15.060
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: -- to make a wisdom saving throw, please.

02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:17.430
MARISHA: Wis save? Oh boy.
SAM: Everybody?

02:33:17.430 --> 02:33:19.650
MATT: Yes, everyone within 60 feet.

02:33:19.650 --> 02:33:20.483
SAM: 60 feet?

02:33:20.483 --> 02:33:23.160
MATT: Which is everybody.
LIAM: Oh, no! Low roll.

02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.050
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

02:33:24.050 --> 02:33:25.220
TRAVIS: 17.

02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:27.460
MATT: Except for maybe Veth,

02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:29.050
who's hiding behind that and doesn't see it.

02:33:29.050 --> 02:33:31.170
So you're fine. You're fine, Veth, you don't--

02:33:31.170 --> 02:33:33.210
SAM: Okay, so my seven won't come into play?

02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:34.661
MATT: Correct.

02:33:34.661 --> 02:33:35.494
Because of your placement,

02:33:35.494 --> 02:33:36.860
when you would not be able to see this creature.

02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:37.693
SAM: Awesome.

02:33:37.693 --> 02:33:39.000
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: 17.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.510
LAURA: 28.
MATT: 28.

02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:41.890
LIAM: Seven.
MATT: A seven.

02:33:42.730 --> 02:33:44.238
MATT: Yasha?

02:33:44.238 --> 02:33:45.204
ASHLEY: Five.

02:33:45.204 --> 02:33:46.757
LIAM: Wow.
TRAVIS: Fuck!

02:33:46.757 --> 02:33:48.368
TALIESIN: 28, I don't know what happened.

02:33:48.368 --> 02:33:49.747
MARISHA: 18.
SAM: What is wrong with you?

02:33:49.747 --> 02:33:51.500
ASHLEY: I am rolling shitty.

02:33:51.500 --> 02:33:52.930
SAM: But you always do.

02:33:52.930 --> 02:33:55.378
ASHLEY: I know!
MATT: Most-- even as close as you are...

02:33:56.410 --> 02:33:58.401
You've seen some shit.
And this isn't-- this isn't much.

02:33:58.401 --> 02:34:01.610
And most of you guys see this and it's scary,

02:34:01.610 --> 02:34:03.080
but you're confident.

02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:06.300
You have more pressing matters to get to,

02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:07.420
except for

02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:09.520
Caleb and Yasha.

02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:11.720
You are frightened for the next minute.

02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:12.893
LIAM: See ya.
MARISHA: Fuck.

02:34:15.204 --> 02:34:16.862
LIAM: I was already halfway there.
MARISHA: For one minute?

02:34:16.862 --> 02:34:17.884
MATT: Yes.

02:34:17.884 --> 02:34:19.850
LAURA: It doesn't mean you have to flee, right?

02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:21.060
Does that mean you have to flee or does that mean

02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:22.247
you just can't get closer?

02:34:22.247 --> 02:34:24.490
MATT: You cannot get closer to it, actively.

02:34:24.490 --> 02:34:25.900
And while it's within your line of sight

02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:28.520
you have disadvantage on attacks,
ability checks, stuff like that.

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:30.503
LIAM: On <i>it</i>, or on everything?
MATT: On anything.

02:34:30.503 --> 02:34:32.140
As long as it's within the line of sight,

02:34:32.140 --> 02:34:34.840
you're scared and you can't do things very well.

02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:36.890
LAURA: If you turn your back to it--

02:34:36.890 --> 02:34:38.810
If you turn your back, does that count?

02:34:38.810 --> 02:34:41.160
MATT: No, within line of sight means that

02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:43.110
in theory, if you were to just turn, it's there.

02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:44.220
You know it's there.

02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:46.364
You have to get behind a wall or something and be--

02:34:46.364 --> 02:34:48.290
(breathing heavily)

02:34:48.290 --> 02:34:50.995
Which really keeps ghosts from getting to you.

02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:53.440
That finishes their ghosts because they all fled.

02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:56.550
That brings us to Caduceus and Yasha so--

02:34:57.900 --> 02:34:59.000
TALIESIN: All right.

02:34:59.930 --> 02:35:02.210
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do just for--

02:35:02.210 --> 02:35:03.230
for fun.

02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:05.160
Let's see how this works.

02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:06.820
TRAVIS: Yasha, your sword's magic, right?

02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:10.360
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up behind,

02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:12.520
as far away from that creepy guy as possible.

02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:14.960
And I'm just going to tap Beau on the shoulder.

02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:15.793
MATT: Okay.

02:35:17.793 --> 02:35:20.400
TALIESIN: And say: You've got this, you're fine.

02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:22.550
And I'm going to cast--
MARISHA: What?

02:35:23.530 --> 02:35:24.790
TALIESIN: Where did it go?

02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:26.083
Holy Weapon.

02:35:26.083 --> 02:35:28.446
(cheering)

02:35:28.446 --> 02:35:32.920
So let's just add 2d8 radiant damage to everything you do.

02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:34.910
MATT: There you go.
TRAVIS: "Everything you do."

02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:37.170
TALIESIN: Now, I'm going to

02:35:37.170 --> 02:35:38.003
kind of

02:35:39.270 --> 02:35:42.070
back-- move me the rest of my movement

02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:44.790
towards the problem ghost.

02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:48.110
MATT: That's about as close as you can get,

02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:49.210
there or there.

02:35:49.210 --> 02:35:51.920
TALIESIN: I don't want to quite
be in the group, so like a little--

02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:52.870
MATT: About there?

02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:53.703
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good.

02:35:53.703 --> 02:35:55.182
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

02:35:56.605 --> 02:35:57.740
Is that your go?

02:35:58.784 --> 02:36:00.020
That's you action, that's your movement.

02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:02.960
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just really
quickly looking at other options.

02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:03.793
MATT: I don't know if you have much,

02:36:03.793 --> 02:36:05.160
you can't cast another spell as a bonus.

02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:06.410
TALIESIN: No, the only thing I can really--

02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:08.570
yeah, the only other thing I'm saving later.

02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:09.780
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:11.590
ASHLEY: Okay, I would like--
MATT: You are scared.

02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:13.265
ASHLEY: -- to rage.
MATT: All right, you rage.

02:36:13.265 --> 02:36:15.080
SAM: I would like to rage.
TALIESIN: Actually, hold on.

02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:16.280
Oh, wait, wait, sorry.

02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:17.390
I'm so sorry, one second.

02:36:17.390 --> 02:36:19.570
TRAVIS: Which makes the fear go away?

02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:23.420
MATT: That's a berserker barbarian thing.

02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:24.253
LAURA: Oh.

02:36:24.253 --> 02:36:26.080
TALIESIN: Can I-- if that was a bonus action.

02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:27.630
I think Holy Weapon is a bonus action.

02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:28.690
MATT: Is Holy Weapon a bonus action?

02:36:28.690 --> 02:36:30.190
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

02:36:30.190 --> 02:36:31.170
Oh, yep it's a bonus action.

02:36:31.170 --> 02:36:32.910
So can I still cast a cantrip?

02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:33.743
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:36:33.743 --> 02:36:35.540
TALIESIN: So I'm going to attack that ghost.

02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:36.373
MATT: All right.

02:36:36.373 --> 02:36:37.630
TALIESIN: With a Sacred Flame.

02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:39.817
MATT: Sacred Flame, is that dexterity?
TALIESIN: It's dexterity.

02:36:39.817 --> 02:36:41.890
LAURA: I'm going to attack that ghost.
MATT: That is a fail with an eight.

02:36:41.890 --> 02:36:44.074
TALIESIN: So let's find--

02:36:44.074 --> 02:36:46.910
LAURA: You do a lot of damage with your cantrips, too.

02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:48.270
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, I'm--

02:36:48.270 --> 02:36:49.570
this is going to hurt him.

02:36:51.735 --> 02:36:53.050
ASHLEY: "This is going to hurt him."

02:36:53.050 --> 02:36:53.883
TALIESIN: That's, uh...

02:36:58.300 --> 02:37:00.570
22 radiant damage.

02:37:00.570 --> 02:37:01.830
MATT: 22 radiant damage.

02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:03.413
TALIESIN: Fuck off.

02:37:06.730 --> 02:37:07.930
MATT: You blast it at the ghost.

02:37:07.930 --> 02:37:10.520
You can see now it's flickering in and out.

02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:12.900
It's on the cusp of dis--

02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:15.550
just completely vanishing from this realm

02:37:15.550 --> 02:37:16.540
and any realm beyond.

02:37:16.540 --> 02:37:17.859
TALIESIN: Scoot, scoot.

02:37:17.859 --> 02:37:19.820
MATT: (laughs)

02:37:19.820 --> 02:37:21.378
TALIESIN: Ghosts.

02:37:21.378 --> 02:37:22.900
MARISHA: Like you're getting possums off the front porch.

02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:23.900
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:26.040
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to attack it.

02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:27.873
SAM: Attack what?

02:37:27.873 --> 02:37:29.548
ASHLEY: Oh, you piece of shit.

02:37:30.597 --> 02:37:32.090
It was on such a good one and then it--

02:37:32.090 --> 02:37:34.790
MATT: Well, you cannot attack it
because it is not next to you

02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:36.850
and you cannot move closer to it.

02:37:36.850 --> 02:37:39.420
LAURA: You can go attack the shadow guy.

02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:40.800
ASHLEY: Because I'm scared of this one.

02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:43.169
MATT: Yes, you're scared of
the ghost in front of you, correct.

02:37:43.169 --> 02:37:44.843
ASHLEY: I'm going to run away from it, then.

02:37:44.843 --> 02:37:46.630
I'm going to go to attack the other one.

02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:48.004
But since I already rolled--

02:37:48.004 --> 02:37:50.257
MATT: Okay, so you move up this way?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:37:50.257 --> 02:37:52.570
MATT: So you run, dodging behind them.

02:37:52.570 --> 02:37:53.680
Get your blade ready.

02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:54.620
It's still an eye line.

02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:56.490
So you do have a disadvantage on your attacks.

02:37:56.490 --> 02:37:57.323
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:37:57.323 --> 02:37:58.780
MATT: But you know, if you're going to take your

02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:00.050
oh, you already rolled so.

02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:01.310
ASHLEY: Wasn't any better.

02:38:01.310 --> 02:38:02.692
MATT: Okay.

02:38:02.692 --> 02:38:04.619
TRAVIS: Do you have a way to get rid of your fear?

02:38:04.619 --> 02:38:06.285
LIAM: I can't hear you.
TRAVIS: Do you have a way to get rid--

02:38:06.285 --> 02:38:07.420
ASHLEY: I rolled that for disadvantage.

02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:09.700
It's already rolled once, but I'll take the first one,

02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:10.660
which was

02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:13.190
13.

02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:14.598
MATT: 13 is a miss.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:38:14.598 --> 02:38:15.748
MATT: Don't forget you have

02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:18.180
reckless attacks.

02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:19.670
That's a big barbarian thing too.

02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:21.110
I know it's been awhile.

02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:23.410
ASHLEY: So if I have disadvantage then that'll just give me--

02:38:23.410 --> 02:38:25.996
MATT: It will give you a single attack,
yeah, but it's too late now.

02:38:25.996 --> 02:38:27.363
But just for future reference.

02:38:27.363 --> 02:38:28.768
ASHLEY: Okay, second attack.
MATT: Okay.

02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:33.765
ASHLEY: Okay, disadvantage still?
MATT: Yes.

02:38:33.765 --> 02:38:35.383
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:38:35.383 --> 02:38:36.857
18?
MATT: 18 does hit.

02:38:36.857 --> 02:38:39.111
(cheering)

02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:44.510
SAM: ♪ Every little thing she kills with magic ♪

02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:45.543
ASHLEY: That's not true.

02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:49.780
MARISHA: ♪ Everything she kills just turns me on ♪

02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:52.313
LAURA: That-- that--
ASHLEY: That might be true.

02:38:52.313 --> 02:38:54.410
Okay, I'm going to try Savage Attacker.

02:38:54.410 --> 02:38:55.960
See if I get something better.

02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:58.290
That's the same.

02:38:58.290 --> 02:38:59.710
Okay.

02:38:59.710 --> 02:39:01.400
Okay, 15 total.

02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:03.590
MATT: 15 damage, all righty.

02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:06.630
As you swing by and strike, the first swing goes wide.

02:39:07.903 --> 02:39:09.660
It turns back, the skull spinning around.

02:39:09.660 --> 02:39:11.530
You can see the red trail

02:39:11.530 --> 02:39:12.870
left behind briefly

02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:14.610
as it spins its head in your direction,

02:39:14.610 --> 02:39:15.870
it fades behind it.

02:39:15.870 --> 02:39:17.770
There's a slight drag behind the movement

02:39:17.770 --> 02:39:20.140
of its piercing, coal-like, red, angry eyes.

02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:21.920
And with that you take a second strike

02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:24.360
reeling back and it does manage to find its way

02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:26.450
into the middle of this spectral wraith-like creature.

02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:27.585
And as it cuts through

02:39:27.585 --> 02:39:28.860
(shrieking)

02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:30.570
It shrieks, you can see once again,

02:39:30.570 --> 02:39:34.030
this is now starting to look very hurt.

02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:37.180
This is-- this is turning, quite quickly.

02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:39.220
That finishes your go, Yasha.

02:39:39.220 --> 02:39:40.053
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:39:40.053 --> 02:39:42.400
MATT: It's now this entity's turn.

02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:45.330
It's going to go ahead and take a swing

02:39:45.330 --> 02:39:46.990
at you, Beauregard, because you have now

02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:49.740
glowing holy fists and that scares the

02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:50.573
fuck out of it.

02:39:50.573 --> 02:39:51.406
MARISHA: Bring it bitch.

02:39:51.406 --> 02:39:53.052
MATT: All right, you did take your Patient Defense, right?

02:39:53.052 --> 02:39:54.415
MARISHA: Yes, I did.

02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:58.900
MATT: Oh, that would be a 14.

02:39:58.900 --> 02:39:59.733
MARISHA: A-miss.

02:39:59.733 --> 02:40:01.620
MATT: With the sword, it swings towards you.

02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:02.995
You just--

02:40:02.995 --> 02:40:03.936
dodge out of the way.

02:40:03.936 --> 02:40:06.360
And it's going now for its necrotic hand.

02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:07.770
It's spinning up with that dark energy

02:40:07.770 --> 02:40:09.740
and it's going to push towards your chest.

02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:11.665
With disadvantage...

02:40:11.665 --> 02:40:12.823
that's a 16.

02:40:14.890 --> 02:40:16.824
MARISHA: Miss.
MATT: So you just--

02:40:16.824 --> 02:40:17.720
duck out of the way.

02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:20.560
This creature's hurt and it's swinging wildly at you

02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:22.290
and it just cannot find its mark on you.

02:40:22.290 --> 02:40:23.483
MARISHA: Can I use my...

02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:27.300
No, I haven't hit with Flurry of Blows.

02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:28.970
I can't use my Preternatural Counter, can I?

02:40:28.970 --> 02:40:31.850
MATT: Correct, you cannot.
MARISHA: Never mind, okay.

02:40:31.850 --> 02:40:33.040
Miss.

02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:33.900
MATT: Okay.

02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:35.320
MARISHA: Miss, miss.

02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:36.440
MATT: All right.

02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:38.115
That finishes its turn. It is now Jester.

02:40:38.115 --> 02:40:39.490
Fjord, you're up on deck.

02:40:39.490 --> 02:40:41.315
TALIESIN: I love that you're doing
the Last Dragon right now.

02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:47.680
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to assume that
Beau can handle the big guy.

02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:50.670
I'm going to turn around and I'm going to

02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:57.080
cast a 1st-level Guiding Bolt at the

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:59.680
spirit behind Fjord so it doesn't possess him.

02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:00.722
MATT: You've got it.

02:41:00.722 --> 02:41:02.660
TRAVIS: (surprised) Oh.

02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:03.920
LAURA: So that is--

02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:07.410
TRAVIS: That's a thing.

02:41:07.410 --> 02:41:08.440
LAURA: 22.

02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:10.100
MATT: That hits.

02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:11.030
LAURA: Okay.

02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:13.880
ASHLEY: I can take care of the big guy, too.

02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:15.850
LAURA: You could, but Beau's going to go before you.

02:41:15.850 --> 02:41:18.420
So that's why I just figured--

02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:19.760
SAM: Sure you can.
ASHLEY: Kill it.

02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:21.160
MARISHA: But you're here, too.

02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:23.910
ASHLEY: I'm here for moral support.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:25.100
LAURA: 16 points.

02:41:25.100 --> 02:41:27.650
MARISHA: Yasha, Yasha, watch me.
LAURA: Of radiant damage.

02:41:27.650 --> 02:41:30.700
MARISHA: Ya-- Yasha, are you watching?
ASHLEY: I'm watching.

02:41:30.700 --> 02:41:34.660
MATT: With that, you blast that ghost
with radiant spearing energy.

02:41:34.660 --> 02:41:36.510
It hits it,

02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:38.498
screams, and then just

02:41:38.498 --> 02:41:40.270
vanishes into the mist.

02:41:40.270 --> 02:41:41.280
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:42.530
LAURA: Be free.

02:41:42.530 --> 02:41:45.980
MATT: As it's destroyed, the central wraith figure just

02:41:47.007 --> 02:41:49.450
screams out in anger.

02:41:49.450 --> 02:41:51.430
Those near it, you can see the eyes burn now

02:41:51.430 --> 02:41:52.750
twice as bright.

02:41:52.750 --> 02:41:55.950
It's now giving off red light from the front of its face.

02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:58.820
It is furious at the destruction of one of its allies.

02:41:58.820 --> 02:41:59.653
LAURA: Oops.

02:41:59.653 --> 02:42:01.490
MATT: And it seems like the shadows around it grow darker

02:42:01.490 --> 02:42:05.205
and it grows a little larger in anger.

02:42:05.205 --> 02:42:07.410
MARISHA: Good to know.
SAM: Like it got more powerful?

02:42:07.410 --> 02:42:08.683
LAURA: Probably, yeah.

02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:11.980
MATT: So Jester, it's still your turn.

02:42:11.980 --> 02:42:12.980
LAURA: Okay.

02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:17.470
For my bonus action...

02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.900
I'm going to...

02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:22.980
turn around

02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:24.813
back to...

02:42:26.971 --> 02:42:29.373
Beau, and I'm going to

02:42:30.656 --> 02:42:31.840
give her another Healing Word

02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:34.570
and say: Get better, Beau!

02:42:34.570 --> 02:42:36.303
MARISHA: Thanks, Jes.
MATT: There you go.

02:42:36.303 --> 02:42:37.480
Staying put?

02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:39.890
SAM: (as Jester) Get good.
LAURA: Get good!

02:42:39.890 --> 02:42:41.880
Yeah, that's seven more points.

02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:43.040
MARISHA: Fuck yes.

02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:45.200
MATT: Are you staying put or are you...?

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:46.340
LAURA: Yes, sir.

02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:47.840
MATT: All right that finishes Jester's go.

02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:50.270
Fjord, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:53.710
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my-- make sure I say it right--

02:42:53.710 --> 02:42:56.560
my Relentless Hex

02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:59.418
to magically teleport up to 30 feet

02:42:59.418 --> 02:43:01.060
next to my Hexblade's Curse.

02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:02.895
So I'm going to appear behind him.

02:43:04.970 --> 02:43:07.703
MATT: Out of the shadows and the green tendrils

02:43:07.703 --> 02:43:09.940
that you left there, you watch as this

02:43:09.940 --> 02:43:11.700
giant angry wraith creature

02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:13.860
with this blackened rune blade in one hand

02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:15.590
and its swirling necrotic energy

02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:17.520
that is currently shouting in anger

02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:18.353
Fjord just--

02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:20.730
emerges behind it.

02:43:20.730 --> 02:43:22.510
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage on this because they're--

02:43:22.510 --> 02:43:24.430
my peoples are flanking him?

02:43:24.430 --> 02:43:27.130
MATT: Technically none of you are-- are flanking.

02:43:27.130 --> 02:43:28.310
Flanking is directly across.

02:43:28.310 --> 02:43:31.298
LIAM: Those squares, man.
LAURA: You could have bamfed directly behind him.

02:43:31.298 --> 02:43:33.845
MATT: You could move here.
TRAVIS: I'll do it so I can do that.

02:43:33.845 --> 02:43:34.803
MATT: You got it.

02:43:34.803 --> 02:43:39.300
TRAVIS: And I will take two swings with the Star Razor.

02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:40.759
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: With advantage.

02:43:40.759 --> 02:43:42.380
LIAM: I like spooky Fjord.

02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:45.387
LAURA: Spooky Fjord is cool.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:43:45.387 --> 02:43:47.929
TRAVIS: That's a 21-- 22 to hit.

02:43:47.929 --> 02:43:48.870
MATT: That hits.

02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:49.703
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:43:49.703 --> 02:43:50.784
TALIESIN: Man, do I have some shit I can do.

02:43:50.784 --> 02:43:54.354
TRAVIS: And I will dump a 5th-level Divine Smite.

02:43:54.354 --> 02:43:55.232
SAM: Ooh.

02:43:55.232 --> 02:43:56.671
MATT: Roll some damage on that.

02:43:56.671 --> 02:43:59.155
SAM: That sounds brutal.
TALIESIN: I can burn--

02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:02.222
LIAM: Let's do it.

02:44:04.601 --> 02:44:07.990
MARISHA: The divine-- divine spikes or whatever,
what are they called, that he just said?

02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:09.630
TRAVIS: 30, 32.

02:44:09.630 --> 02:44:11.850
And then Divine Smite is how many?

02:44:11.850 --> 02:44:13.683
TALIESIN: 4d8 radiant.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:17.430
TRAVIS: What is divine-- how many--
how many divine-- is Divine Smite?

02:44:17.430 --> 02:44:18.263
LIAM: Oh boy.

02:44:18.263 --> 02:44:19.240
SAM: 5d8.

02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:21.920
MATT: I forgot to roll for Viya's initiative, my bad.

02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:23.410
LAURA: Whoops.

02:44:23.410 --> 02:44:26.568
Vilya's just standing there like, "Wow, this fucking sucks."

02:44:26.568 --> 02:44:29.120
MATT: Well, you know what? We'll get to that.

02:44:30.094 --> 02:44:30.927
We'll get to that.

02:44:30.927 --> 02:44:34.530
TRAVIS: Yeah, 5d8.
LAURA: Whoa, it is 5d8?

02:44:34.530 --> 02:44:36.630
Holy moly.

02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:39.318
TALIESIN: Sweet Christmas.
MATT: It is undead.

02:44:40.310 --> 02:44:41.978
LIAM: So an extra d8?

02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:44.785
LAURA: Or he's just gets double damage?

02:44:44.785 --> 02:44:45.618
MATT: No, no, no.

02:44:45.618 --> 02:44:48.210
There isn't actually do additional damage.

02:44:48.210 --> 02:44:51.535
TRAVIS: 22, 27.

02:44:51.535 --> 02:44:53.220
MATT: It's 6d8 because it is undead.

02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:54.610
TRAVIS: Oh!

02:44:54.610 --> 02:44:56.120
MATT: Undead and fiends get an additional d8.

02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:59.346
TRAVIS: Nine-- I mean, uh-- that's a six.

02:44:59.346 --> 02:45:01.660
(laughter)

02:45:01.660 --> 02:45:02.910
LAURA: Nine-- it's an eight--

02:45:02.910 --> 02:45:04.460
TRAVIS: It's a six.
LAURA: It's a six.

02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:08.170
TRAVIS: That is 65 points of damage.

02:45:08.170 --> 02:45:10.110
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

02:45:10.110 --> 02:45:11.372
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:45:11.372 --> 02:45:13.640
(cheering)

02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:15.440
TRAVIS: I'll pop up opposite of my ladies

02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:18.175
and be like: Let's wreck this.

02:45:18.175 --> 02:45:20.130
(whooshing)

02:45:20.130 --> 02:45:24.153
MATT: As the blade strikes down, you watch as the fog

02:45:24.153 --> 02:45:26.880
separates and a single beam of sunlight

02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:29.970
seems to carve through from the open sky.

02:45:29.970 --> 02:45:31.830
As the Wild Mother's wrath comes through,

02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:33.050
channeled into your blade,

02:45:33.050 --> 02:45:36.260
and as it carves into this being of shadow,

02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:38.090
it doesn't even have a chance to screech.

02:45:38.090 --> 02:45:40.940
You watch as the shadow folds,

02:45:40.940 --> 02:45:43.710
curls inward, and then (poof)

02:45:43.710 --> 02:45:44.590
is gone.

02:45:44.590 --> 02:45:45.650
There left in the ground,

02:45:45.650 --> 02:45:48.140
there is a slight crater, as you hear

02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:49.950
the crackling impact sound of stone

02:45:49.950 --> 02:45:51.780
that was cast to the side.

02:45:51.780 --> 02:45:54.410
And a little series of red, coal-burning lights,

02:45:54.410 --> 02:45:57.318
where the eyes once were in the creature just slowly

02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:01.909
streaks smoke and vanish.

02:46:01.909 --> 02:46:03.050
TRAVIS: Tricep flex.

02:46:03.050 --> 02:46:05.682
MATT: All the other ghosts immediately

02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:07.613
flee.

02:46:08.850 --> 02:46:09.983
LAURA: Whoa.

02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:13.070
MARISHA: Yasha, were you watching?

02:46:14.170 --> 02:46:17.030
ASHLEY: I saw all of it. You guys were all amazing.

02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:18.230
It was so great.

02:46:18.230 --> 02:46:19.063
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:46:19.063 --> 02:46:22.646
ASHLEY: Remember that time that I got possessed yet again?

02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:24.893
MARISHA: Are you okay?

02:46:26.156 --> 02:46:26.989
ASHLEY: Eh.

02:46:26.989 --> 02:46:28.204
TALIESIN: (laughs)

02:46:28.204 --> 02:46:29.620
LAURA: We got to work on your, like, wisdom saves.

02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:31.935
We got to figure out the way to make your brain--

02:46:31.935 --> 02:46:33.380
maybe I could make you, like, a tinfoil hat.

02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:34.434
ASHLEY: Like a-- yeah.

02:46:34.434 --> 02:46:36.190
TRAVIS: Can I use Divine Sense to see

02:46:36.190 --> 02:46:38.950
within 60 feet, if there are any more celestial, fiends,

02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:40.190
or undead around us?

02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:41.200
MATT: Sure.

02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:42.033
And as you do that,

02:46:42.033 --> 02:46:45.330
you concentrate and focus and there are none.

02:46:45.330 --> 02:46:47.290
The whispers have ceased.

02:46:47.290 --> 02:46:49.940
Looks like some of the local--

02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:51.420
the mist remains,

02:46:51.420 --> 02:46:53.210
but it looks like some of the fog in the vicinity

02:46:53.210 --> 02:46:55.530
begins to slightly dissipate.

02:46:55.530 --> 02:46:57.849
LAURA: Did we kill the bad guy in this area?

02:46:57.849 --> 02:46:59.140
TALIESIN: Why don't we check out what's in that tower?

02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:01.820
LIAM: Yeah, as soon as it seems like the danger is past,

02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:03.490
eyes on the obelisk.

02:47:03.490 --> 02:47:05.607
SAM: I found it! I found it.

02:47:05.607 --> 02:47:08.440
There was a pebble in my crossbow.

02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:10.020
It was making it shoot crazy.

02:47:10.020 --> 02:47:11.000
TRAVIS: Is that what it was?

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:11.833
SAM: It was a pebble.

02:47:11.833 --> 02:47:13.650
I took it out. Should be fine now.

02:47:13.650 --> 02:47:15.334
Sorry about that, everybody.

02:47:15.334 --> 02:47:16.380
LAURA: It's okay, Nott.

02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:17.520
Veth, I'm sorry.

02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:18.730
SAM: No, it's fine.

02:47:18.730 --> 02:47:21.925
LIAM: You have a lot of ash and dirt on your

02:47:21.925 --> 02:47:23.010
tush and your butt side from--

02:47:23.010 --> 02:47:25.620
SAM: Yeah, I was sitting there trying to fix it.

02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:26.570
LIAM: Yeah.

02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:28.762
MATT: All right, so--
TALIESIN: You're going to glow for an hour.

02:47:28.762 --> 02:47:30.090
MARISHA: Oh, this lasts for an hour?

02:47:30.090 --> 02:47:31.874
TALIESIN: Yep.
MARISHA: Oh, hell yeah.

02:47:31.874 --> 02:47:33.560
LAURA: Let's-- yeah, it will light the tower.

02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:36.270
MATT: Okay, you can see Vilya looks a bit shaken by this

02:47:36.270 --> 02:47:39.770
and goes, "You're certainly capable.

02:47:39.770 --> 02:47:41.388
"You're not wrong."

02:47:41.388 --> 02:47:43.320
LAURA: Vilya?

02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:46.368
Did you just not want to fight with us?

02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:49.640
MATT: "I was going to try and talk to them."

02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:50.473
LAURA: Oh.

02:47:51.690 --> 02:47:54.530
MATT: "But that option went away quickly.

02:47:54.530 --> 02:47:57.260
"When you killed them."

02:47:57.260 --> 02:47:59.160
TRAVIS: Dis-dispatched them.

02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:00.191
MATT: "Dispatched."

02:48:00.191 --> 02:48:01.860
TRAVIS: Gave them an opportunity to return.

02:48:01.860 --> 02:48:05.070
LAURA: Yeah, they could maybe be back on the plane maybe.

02:48:05.070 --> 02:48:06.930
TRAVIS: They kind of were already dead.

02:48:06.930 --> 02:48:08.930
SAM: She's not wrong, though. We could have learned more

02:48:08.930 --> 02:48:10.987
about how they got here or

02:48:10.987 --> 02:48:14.260
what they wanted from this place.

02:48:14.260 --> 02:48:15.790
LIAM: Well, maybe we still will.

02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:17.510
MARISHA: I mean, it kind of feels like it's clear

02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:20.841
where they came from and what they wanted, though, right?

02:48:20.841 --> 02:48:22.588
TRAVIS: They did say--
MARISHA: What would you have said?

02:48:23.980 --> 02:48:26.630
MATT: "I would have asked if they had

02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:31.460
"reason to perhaps join our side or..."

02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:32.560
MARISHA: That's more or less what I said

02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:35.470
when I said "Fuck Vokodo," am I right?

02:48:35.470 --> 02:48:36.760
LAURA: Next time say "Fuck Vokodo"

02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:38.540
before you punch them in the face.

02:48:38.540 --> 02:48:40.110
MARISHA: Well, it was, you know--

02:48:40.110 --> 02:48:41.670
TRAVIS: What if they couldn't leave this area?

02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:43.420
What if this was, like, part of their realm

02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:45.590
and this was as far as their reach would go?

02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:47.450
MATT: "That's very possible."

02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:48.810
LAURA: That's true.
TRAVIS: We just don't know.

02:48:48.810 --> 02:48:51.601
LAURA: That's true.
TRAVIS: Because you punched it in the face.

02:48:51.601 --> 02:48:52.780
MATT: "Well--
TRAVIS: Just kidding.

02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:55.428
MATT: "-- to be fair, none of you really

02:48:56.800 --> 02:48:59.020
"stopped either."

02:48:59.020 --> 02:49:01.160
LAURA: Yeah, well, at that point
he was already attacking Beau.

02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:04.060
I can't defend somebody that's attacking--

02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:07.210
SAM: I was firing warning shots, to--

02:49:07.210 --> 02:49:08.700
LAURA: Directly into your own face.

02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:10.007
SAM: -- to shoot-- to show them that

02:49:10.007 --> 02:49:11.680
we could attack them.

02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:13.517
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:18.230
SAM: Ooh, 17 minus

02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:19.940
two so 15.

02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:20.960
MATT: 15.

02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:25.080
Vilya looks at you and goes, "Uh huh."

02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:28.645
MARISHA: Into your face.
LIAM: Caleb is already ascending

02:49:28.645 --> 02:49:31.170
those stairs and casting Detect Magic during that squabble.

02:49:31.170 --> 02:49:32.190
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:49:32.190 --> 02:49:33.215
MATT: Okay.

02:49:34.410 --> 02:49:36.610
As you begin to make your way

02:49:36.610 --> 02:49:38.590
up to an entrance

02:49:38.590 --> 02:49:40.330
to this one sliver,

02:49:40.330 --> 02:49:43.352
this fragment of tower, this strange

02:49:44.350 --> 02:49:46.058
open portion.

02:49:46.058 --> 02:49:48.680
You don't detect any magic,

02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:49.830
but you begin to see

02:49:49.830 --> 02:49:52.628
writing on the inside of the walls.

02:49:54.130 --> 02:49:56.410
A language that you don't necessarily understand.

02:49:56.410 --> 02:49:59.270
LIAM: Well, I know Celestial and Sylvan,

02:49:59.270 --> 02:50:01.790
but I pull out my book because I don't understand it.

02:50:01.790 --> 02:50:04.310
And I turn to the page for Comprehend Languages

02:50:04.310 --> 02:50:06.740
and I begin the process of casting that.

02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:08.020
MATT: Okay, and that will take you 10 minutes?

02:50:08.020 --> 02:50:08.853
LIAM: Ten minutes, yeah.

02:50:08.853 --> 02:50:10.250
MATT: What are the rest of you
doing while Caleb's doing that?

02:50:10.250 --> 02:50:12.910
SAM: Searching the tower.

02:50:12.910 --> 02:50:14.673
LAURA: All of it?
TRAVIS: Well, yeah.

02:50:14.673 --> 02:50:16.013
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at least

02:50:16.013 --> 02:50:17.221
at the ground floor.

02:50:17.221 --> 02:50:18.512
So you see if it's safe.

02:50:18.512 --> 02:50:21.920
LAURA: How tall-- how many floors up does it seem to go?

02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:23.510
MATT: Before it carves off?

02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:24.830
It looks like seven.

02:50:24.830 --> 02:50:26.110
SAM: Whoa.

02:50:26.110 --> 02:50:29.140
TRAVIS: Also stairs are probably missing.

02:50:29.140 --> 02:50:30.598
MATT: There is that.

02:50:32.050 --> 02:50:34.723
TRAVIS: But we can see how far we can go?

02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:36.813
TALIESIN: Let's take a look.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:50:36.813 --> 02:50:38.190
LAURA: Beau can climb up the side of it.

02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:39.890
MARISHA: That's kind of what I was thinking, too.

02:50:39.890 --> 02:50:43.098
TRAVIS: Well, get after it, Miles Morales.

02:50:43.098 --> 02:50:44.640
MARISHA: Yeah, race you to the top.

02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:46.900
I'll go to the outside and see how far I can get.

02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:47.940
TRAVIS: That's not a fair race.

02:50:47.940 --> 02:50:48.773
No one else can do that.

02:50:48.773 --> 02:50:53.170
MARISHA: Climbing-- it's fair to me, woo!

02:50:53.170 --> 02:50:55.520
MATT: Okay, so as you sit down and begin studying,

02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:57.350
they begin stepping around you, Caleb,

02:50:57.350 --> 02:50:59.700
and making their way into the interior of the tower.

02:50:59.700 --> 02:51:02.250
Beauregard begins parkouring up the side.

02:51:02.250 --> 02:51:03.520
As you come around the edge, Beauregard,

02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:07.680
you can see the portion of the tower that was facing you

02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:10.500
and somewhat this side is the outer wall.

02:51:10.500 --> 02:51:12.857
Once you come around the edge, it is open.

02:51:12.857 --> 02:51:14.540
It is just--

02:51:14.540 --> 02:51:18.210
the portions of floor that remain just coming to an end

02:51:18.210 --> 02:51:21.570
with loose bricks, dangling off the edge.

02:51:21.570 --> 02:51:23.970
Once again, it looks like it was just carved out

02:51:23.970 --> 02:51:27.512
and it's like a slice of cake.

02:51:27.512 --> 02:51:28.840
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:30.350
TALIESIN: Too topical.

02:51:30.350 --> 02:51:31.450
MATT: Fair enough.

02:51:31.450 --> 02:51:34.002
Everything's cake.
LIAM: Everything's cake.

02:51:34.002 --> 02:51:35.582
MATT: That will be an old meme by the time this comes out.

02:51:35.582 --> 02:51:36.707
(laughter)

02:51:36.707 --> 02:51:37.890
So

02:51:39.910 --> 02:51:41.430
from best you can tell,

02:51:41.430 --> 02:51:44.500
it's much taller than it is thick.

02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:46.780
And as far as interior substance of it,

02:51:46.780 --> 02:51:49.150
the architecture is

02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:51.410
gorgeous, if ominous.

02:51:51.410 --> 02:51:53.760
And once again, calling back to the Ruins

02:51:53.760 --> 02:51:55.550
on the outside of Rosohna,

02:51:55.550 --> 02:51:58.100
some of the larger ruined

02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:00.260
what looked like citadels from

02:52:01.270 --> 02:52:05.142
the Calamity days of Xhorhas.

02:52:05.142 --> 02:52:07.560
Reminiscent in structure and design to that.

02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:09.292
A lot of angular

02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:15.300
pointed and jagged archways over doors and passages.

02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:18.240
The stairs themselves seem to be

02:52:19.540 --> 02:52:23.630
a very finely hewn stone with older

02:52:23.630 --> 02:52:26.000
now mold-soaked velvets

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:29.590
and ceremonial materials placed on walls

02:52:29.590 --> 02:52:33.550
as tapestries and such that have just rotted over time.

02:52:33.550 --> 02:52:36.320
Everything here is

02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:39.700
of black stone and obsidian,

02:52:39.700 --> 02:52:41.860
to elements of darkened iron

02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:43.510
that have now rusted over and added

02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:46.810
a brown and red tint to where

02:52:46.810 --> 02:52:49.422
certain areas in certain

02:52:49.422 --> 02:52:50.420
elements of the structure are

02:52:50.420 --> 02:52:52.665
joined together by the metal.

02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:55.780
As you ascend,

02:52:55.780 --> 02:52:58.920
you see the main chamber, the base chamber

02:52:58.920 --> 02:52:59.970
which is the largest part.

02:52:59.970 --> 02:53:00.803
And just the corner of it,

02:53:00.803 --> 02:53:02.880
because as soon as you step up past Caleb

02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:05.260
through the staircase that leads into that area,

02:53:05.260 --> 02:53:06.093
there's light.

02:53:06.093 --> 02:53:07.160
There is no back wall.

02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:09.300
It just opens up into

02:53:09.300 --> 02:53:12.290
the rest of the surrounding area of the Ruin.

02:53:12.290 --> 02:53:16.020
And there are no other structures beyond this tower.

02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:16.950
Everything that you walked by,

02:53:16.950 --> 02:53:18.770
whatever portion of a city or a village

02:53:18.770 --> 02:53:20.170
that you walked through,

02:53:20.170 --> 02:53:23.700
it looks like that ended along with the line of

02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:25.955
whatever ended this tower.

02:53:27.370 --> 02:53:29.380
SAM: And down on the ground.

02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:30.213
Is there a--

02:53:31.070 --> 02:53:31.950
is there a rift?

02:53:31.950 --> 02:53:32.783
Is there a line?

02:53:32.783 --> 02:53:34.390
Is there a glowing?
MATT: No rift.

02:53:34.390 --> 02:53:37.390
It's just like someone took a portion of

02:53:37.390 --> 02:53:41.700
a ruined village and a corner of a tower somewhere

02:53:41.700 --> 02:53:43.800
and just shunted it here.

02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:46.540
TRAVIS: And it is more of a tower than like

02:53:46.540 --> 02:53:49.270
a stair-stepping pyramid structure?

02:53:49.270 --> 02:53:50.550
MATT: Correct. It is a tower.

02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:52.740
There's just some layers

02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:55.540
as far as it gets, you know, thinner towards the top.

02:53:55.540 --> 02:53:57.940
But the floor that is here, you can see it being

02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:00.935
very well-crafted.

02:54:02.493 --> 02:54:03.590
The stonework is beautiful.

02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:06.330
And you do see a handful of

02:54:06.330 --> 02:54:07.555
stone

02:54:08.610 --> 02:54:10.268
sarcophagi.

02:54:13.986 --> 02:54:15.110
SAM: On the ground floor?

02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:19.207
MATT: On the ground floor, you see two present here.

02:54:20.180 --> 02:54:21.610
TRAVIS: Do we want to check out the graves?

02:54:21.610 --> 02:54:22.690
LAURA: Check out for traps.

02:54:22.690 --> 02:54:23.780
TRAVIS: I'll hop down there, too.

02:54:23.780 --> 02:54:25.120
SAM: Okay, I'll go check for traps.

02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:29.000
LAURA: I heard it's dangerous to open random sarcophagi.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:30.250
SAM: You heard that?

02:54:30.250 --> 02:54:31.373
LAURA: Somewhere.
TALIESIN: That's weird.

02:54:31.373 --> 02:54:33.410
TRAVIS: In a song or something?

02:54:33.410 --> 02:54:36.550
ASHLEY: Is there anything written on-- I'd love to.

02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:38.000
MATT: There is.

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:39.435
Also in Infernal.

02:54:40.594 --> 02:54:42.027
LAURA: Oh!

02:54:42.027 --> 02:54:43.277
I can read that.

02:54:43.277 --> 02:54:44.220
MATT: Okay.

02:54:44.220 --> 02:54:46.120
So as you approach one of the two--

02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:47.730
and they're both, like,

02:54:47.730 --> 02:54:49.180
fairly well-made, though

02:54:49.180 --> 02:54:51.170
the detail doesn't change the two of them.

02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:53.310
They're fairly

02:54:53.310 --> 02:54:56.163
similar in shape, design.

02:54:57.110 --> 02:55:02.000
They both say "Retainers to the Lord."

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.230
And there are--

02:55:04.230 --> 02:55:06.300
what looked to be where names would be placed,

02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:09.330
there are no names there.

02:55:09.330 --> 02:55:10.830
Like they are left nameless.

02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:13.180
But just given the title of Retainers to the Lord.

02:55:13.180 --> 02:55:16.270
LAURA: Retainers to the Lord, like Oracs?

02:55:17.400 --> 02:55:18.925
SAM: You mean like--

02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:22.380
like teeth retainers?

02:55:22.380 --> 02:55:24.120
Like, is this where he keeps his...

02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:25.960
TRAVIS: No, no.

02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:27.972
ASHLEY: Are there's symbols anywhere?

02:55:29.470 --> 02:55:31.950
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:55:31.950 --> 02:55:34.170
LAURA: So this is-- these are--

02:55:35.610 --> 02:55:36.940
this is from Hell?

02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:39.530
SAM: If this is from Hell--
ASHLEY: 22.

02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:42.860
SAM: They don't bury their dead. They're in dead land.

02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:45.370
Like, why would they bury or entomb--

02:55:45.370 --> 02:55:47.320
TRAVIS: Retainers?

02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:49.160
LAURA: What does that mean?

02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:50.390
LAURA: Beau, you're smart.

02:55:50.390 --> 02:55:51.810
Caleb, you're smart.

02:55:51.810 --> 02:55:55.000
SAM: Retainers could be helpers of the lord, right?

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:56.130
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: Like a servant or another thing.

02:55:56.130 --> 02:55:58.120
TALIESIN: Perhaps these are retainer containers.

02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:01.195
TRAVIS: Or something that you put away to be used later.

02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:03.620
MATT: Yasha, what'd you roll?

02:56:03.620 --> 02:56:04.453
ASHLEY: 22.

02:56:04.453 --> 02:56:06.610
MATT: 22, nice.

02:56:06.610 --> 02:56:09.520
You see symbols

02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:12.240
across the top of each of these

02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:15.790
stone tablets, as well as the archway on the inside.

02:56:15.790 --> 02:56:18.590
Like once you walk past and enter this base floor,

02:56:18.590 --> 02:56:20.610
looking back over the archway, there's a similar symbol.

02:56:20.610 --> 02:56:23.370
And it is a long dark blade.

02:56:23.370 --> 02:56:25.320
You can see with a couple of runes

02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:27.420
around the base of it.

02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:29.470
Very similar to the one that was being wielded

02:56:29.470 --> 02:56:33.772
by the shadow spectral creature that you defeated outside.

02:56:37.950 --> 02:56:39.357
MATT: Beauregard.
MARISHA: Is he a retainer?

02:56:39.357 --> 02:56:40.306
Yeah.

02:56:40.306 --> 02:56:42.920
MATT: You've climbed up to look onto the second floor.

02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:44.540
And loosely over one of these,

02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:46.660
and hanging off the edge,

02:56:46.660 --> 02:56:47.560
not quite falling,

02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:49.480
but it's on that teetering edge of the stone

02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:51.356
that's just starting to fall and crumble,

02:56:51.356 --> 02:56:54.600
you see a very large,

02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:57.290
very gorgeous, adorned,

02:56:57.290 --> 02:56:59.712
black metal sarcophagus.

02:57:00.870 --> 02:57:03.150
MARISHA: On the second floor?
MATT: On the second floor.

02:57:03.150 --> 02:57:04.660
TRAVIS: So three total sarcophagi?

02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:06.330
MARISHA: Two on the bottom floor

02:57:06.330 --> 02:57:08.725
and the larger more orate one on the second.

02:57:08.725 --> 02:57:09.733
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:57:09.733 --> 02:57:10.566
SAM: I wonder if we--

02:57:10.566 --> 02:57:11.980
LAURA: And it doesn't look disturbed at all?

02:57:11.980 --> 02:57:14.010
It's, like, perfectly closed?

02:57:14.010 --> 02:57:15.130
MATT: From what you can see, yeah.

02:57:15.130 --> 02:57:17.940
It's just slightly tilted because the floor

02:57:17.940 --> 02:57:22.065
that it rests upon is broken off at that same angle.

02:57:22.065 --> 02:57:23.160
And it looks like, over time,

02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:25.850
it's starting to bow and

02:57:25.850 --> 02:57:29.170
whether through general weathering or other elements,

02:57:29.170 --> 02:57:31.010
it's starting to crumble a bit.

02:57:31.010 --> 02:57:32.470
SAM: Are there any more up higher?

02:57:32.470 --> 02:57:33.770
MARISHA: That's what I'm going to look for.

02:57:33.770 --> 02:57:34.736
I'm going to keep going.

02:57:34.736 --> 02:57:37.828
MATT: Okay. You climb up the two more floors above.

02:57:37.828 --> 02:57:41.560
You see two more identical sarcophaguses

02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:43.230
to the ones in the bottom floor

02:57:43.230 --> 02:57:45.260
that are loosely overlapping,

02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:48.490
where the large one is, but those are the last you see.

02:57:48.490 --> 02:57:50.600
The two floors above, they're too small.

02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:52.740
Similar design, but the floor space gets smaller

02:57:52.740 --> 02:57:55.330
with each one as the pointed sliver of it

02:57:55.330 --> 02:57:57.070
comes to its apex.

02:57:57.070 --> 02:57:59.090
And it just looks like you're catching the edges of rooms,

02:57:59.090 --> 02:58:01.350
uncertain of what may have been within the larger structure.

02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:03.900
And once again, this would be the corner

02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:05.900
of a much larger tower.

02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:09.970
So this is just a small section of a massive structure,

02:58:09.970 --> 02:58:11.630
wherever it may have come from.

02:58:11.630 --> 02:58:13.460
LIAM: It seems to match up to the numbers on the ground.

02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:14.293
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.

02:58:15.420 --> 02:58:19.940
TRAVIS: Yeah, a retainer is normally
used at some point later.

02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:24.920
MARISHA: So one big one and four ghost tiny ones.

02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:25.753
LIAM: Yeah.

02:58:27.140 --> 02:58:29.010
TRAVIS: We're definitely opening them, yes?

02:58:29.010 --> 02:58:29.843
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

02:58:29.843 --> 02:58:31.480
SAM: We should open it up one of the smaller ones first

02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:33.353
in case they're--
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:58:33.353 --> 02:58:34.690
<i>After</i> checking for traps.

02:58:34.690 --> 02:58:35.750
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:37.760
MARISHA: I'm back down to the ground floor with them

02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:38.940
and relay what I saw.

02:58:38.940 --> 02:58:39.850
MATT: Okay.

02:58:39.850 --> 02:58:41.520
LIAM: Have my 10 minutes gone by, at this point?

02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:42.813
MATT: At this point, I'd say yeah.

02:58:42.813 --> 02:58:44.570
LIAM: Okay.

02:58:44.570 --> 02:58:48.360
What am I looking at on the outside of the building?

02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:52.365
MATT: You see statements that essentially equate to:

02:58:57.170 --> 02:59:01.160
"The one of 12 here to guard

02:59:01.160 --> 02:59:02.965
"for all of time."

02:59:07.600 --> 02:59:09.190
That's primarily what you get across

02:59:09.190 --> 02:59:10.349
from just the entryway.

02:59:10.349 --> 02:59:11.182
LIAM: Okay.

02:59:13.580 --> 02:59:15.305
LAURA: 12. So whatever this--

02:59:15.305 --> 02:59:19.807
LIAM: Does that jostle anything
in his noodle from reading over?

02:59:19.807 --> 02:59:21.463
MATT: Make a history check.

02:59:22.340 --> 02:59:23.770
TRAVIS: 25 or higher.

02:59:23.770 --> 02:59:24.870
LIAM: 27.

02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:26.345
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:59:26.345 --> 02:59:27.405
MATT: No.

02:59:27.405 --> 02:59:28.363
LAURA: Oh, wow.

02:59:28.363 --> 02:59:30.610
LIAM: Deep shit.
SAM: Ancient knowledge.

02:59:30.610 --> 02:59:32.557
ASHLEY: Wait, did you ask what language it is?

02:59:32.557 --> 02:59:33.500
LIAM: It's probably Infernal.

02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:35.340
MATT: It's Infernal.

02:59:35.340 --> 02:59:37.710
LIAM: It's cool how Jester walked by, could totally read it,

02:59:37.710 --> 02:59:39.747
and Caleb's like--

02:59:39.747 --> 02:59:41.543
(laughter)

02:59:41.543 --> 02:59:42.876
LAURA: Oh, did you want to read that?

02:59:42.876 --> 02:59:46.137
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Sorry.

02:59:46.137 --> 02:59:48.190
SAM: Shall we check one for traps?

02:59:48.190 --> 02:59:49.070
One of the smallies?

02:59:49.070 --> 02:59:50.620
TALIESIN: We've got Beau here.

02:59:50.620 --> 02:59:52.270
SAM: All right I'll check one of the small--

02:59:52.270 --> 02:59:53.936
TALIESIN: Because you're still glowing.
SAM: -- tombs for traps.

02:59:53.936 --> 02:59:55.770
They haven't been opened yet.

02:59:55.770 --> 02:59:57.036
MATT: Not, from that you can tell.

02:59:57.036 --> 02:59:58.996
SAM: Okay, I'll check one for traps.

03:00:00.380 --> 03:00:01.310
What am I doing?

03:00:01.310 --> 03:00:02.570
Investigation?
MATT: This would be investigation.

03:00:02.570 --> 03:00:03.500
SAM: 21.

03:00:03.500 --> 03:00:06.160
MATT: 21. Does not appear to be trapped.

03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:08.160
LAURA: Does it appeared to be magic?

03:00:08.160 --> 03:00:09.180
SAM: I can't tell that.

03:00:11.010 --> 03:00:14.460
TRAVIS: Maybe we wait for the wizard to get in here.

03:00:14.460 --> 03:00:16.580
MATT: Caleb has now joined the rest of you

03:00:16.580 --> 03:00:17.670
as you've slowly made your way through

03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:19.550
looking for any other inscription.

03:00:19.550 --> 03:00:20.890
LIAM: And I heard Fjord say that

03:00:20.890 --> 03:00:24.730
and I will instantly cast Detect Magic.

03:00:24.730 --> 03:00:26.330
MATT: Okay.

03:00:26.330 --> 03:00:27.163
LIAM: Re-up it.

03:00:27.163 --> 03:00:29.070
MATT: Nothing magical catches your attention

03:00:29.070 --> 03:00:30.960
from either of these sarcophagi.

03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:32.210
SAM: All right, let's try to open it.

03:00:32.210 --> 03:00:34.820
TRAVIS: Who's going to be the one to push it open?

03:00:34.820 --> 03:00:35.653
LAURA: I mean--

03:00:35.653 --> 03:00:38.020
SAM: My Mage Hand can only do, like, five pounds so.

03:00:38.020 --> 03:00:39.550
ASHLEY: I'll push it open.

03:00:39.550 --> 03:00:41.680
LIAM: And we're doing one of the basic ones, right?

03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:42.513
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:46.790
LAURA: I'll hold my hand out, get ready to heal Yasha

03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:48.471
if, whatever.

03:00:48.471 --> 03:00:49.321
Yeah, yeah.

03:00:49.321 --> 03:00:50.437
TALIESIN: You're good.

03:00:50.437 --> 03:00:51.390
ASHLEY: Push it open.

03:00:51.390 --> 03:00:56.140
MATT: Okay, you push it open. (sliding)

03:00:56.140 --> 03:01:01.140
Immediately this smell of very, very old

03:01:01.150 --> 03:01:05.550
dusty decay gets to your nose, but it is been--

03:01:06.970 --> 03:01:08.000
it's just brief.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.200
Because whatever has been sealed in here has

03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:13.410
been finished rotting

03:01:13.410 --> 03:01:14.940
for a very long time.

03:01:14.940 --> 03:01:16.970
You look down and as the scent passes,

03:01:16.970 --> 03:01:21.970
you can see the skeletal remains of a figure in robes

03:01:22.292 --> 03:01:25.409
and faint bits of armor that is

03:01:25.409 --> 03:01:26.270
just left there.

03:01:26.270 --> 03:01:28.070
This blackened metal armor.

03:01:29.010 --> 03:01:30.030
Long rotted.

03:01:30.030 --> 03:01:33.346
LAURA: Does the armor look like the ghosts that we saw?

03:01:33.346 --> 03:01:34.779
MATT: It looks pretty identical.

03:01:34.779 --> 03:01:36.090
TRAVIS: Leather or metal?

03:01:36.090 --> 03:01:36.950
MATT: Metal.

03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:37.890
LAURA: We should open the big one.

03:01:37.890 --> 03:01:39.380
That was for the shadow creature.

03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:40.270
MARISHA: Absolutely.

03:01:40.270 --> 03:01:43.630
TRAVIS: Well, that armor is pretty cool, right?

03:01:43.630 --> 03:01:46.534
MARISHA: You want to wear that nasty--

03:01:46.534 --> 03:01:48.100
MATT: It's considered half plate.

03:01:48.100 --> 03:01:48.933
TRAVIS: What is it?

03:01:48.933 --> 03:01:49.766
MATT: Considered half plate.

03:01:49.766 --> 03:01:51.370
TRAVIS: Half plate.

03:01:51.370 --> 03:01:53.238
I know what that means.

03:01:53.238 --> 03:01:54.071
(laughter)

03:01:54.071 --> 03:01:56.040
TALIESIN: It's not magical armor
or anything like that, right?

03:01:56.040 --> 03:01:58.070
MATT: You don't get a magical essence from the armor.

03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.990
It has beautiful scrolling.

03:01:58.990 --> 03:02:00.900
It looks more ornamental

03:02:00.900 --> 03:02:03.340
or ceremonial than

03:02:03.340 --> 03:02:05.610
anything really meant to be brought into battle.

03:02:05.610 --> 03:02:07.760
It doesn't have any war scars on it or anything--

03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:08.593
LAURA: Which makes sense.

03:02:08.593 --> 03:02:10.330
MATT: These are designed for the burial and entombment

03:02:10.330 --> 03:02:12.210
of these corpses.

03:02:12.210 --> 03:02:13.390
TALIESIN: One more small one or the big one?

03:02:13.390 --> 03:02:14.223
LAURA: Big one.

03:02:14.223 --> 03:02:16.600
LIAM: I just want to get within range of the big one

03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:18.210
before my spell.

03:02:18.210 --> 03:02:19.760
MARISHA: Oh, we got to go up a floor.

03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:21.300
MATT: There are no stairs that go to the second floor,

03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:22.938
by the way. Much like Fjord,

03:02:22.938 --> 03:02:25.040
any sort of entranceway to the upper floors

03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:27.320
apparently exist elsewhere in this larger structure

03:02:27.320 --> 03:02:28.153
that are not present.

03:02:28.153 --> 03:02:29.030
So you're going to have to climb.

03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:31.740
LAURA: Well, you can give the rope to Beau,

03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:33.630
you can climb up, and then just toss it down

03:02:33.630 --> 03:02:35.380
so we can have the aid of a rope.

03:02:35.380 --> 03:02:36.213
MATT: That's easy enough to do,

03:02:36.213 --> 03:02:37.450
it'll take you a little bit time.

03:02:37.450 --> 03:02:38.440
Vilya just

03:02:39.980 --> 03:02:42.180
walks over and takes a gust of wind,

03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:43.950
takes a leap and parkours off the wall

03:02:43.950 --> 03:02:44.913
and gets up to the second floor.

03:02:44.913 --> 03:02:46.063
LAURA: She's cool.
TALIESIN: That's cool.

03:02:47.660 --> 03:02:48.785
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: I'll take the rope,

03:02:48.785 --> 03:02:51.088
anchor it to a pillar nearby.

03:02:51.088 --> 03:02:53.020
MATT: Vilya helps you situate it.

03:02:53.020 --> 03:02:54.450
Eventually, you guys all make it to the second floor

03:02:54.450 --> 03:02:55.860
and there, you can see the large sarcophagus

03:02:55.860 --> 03:02:58.980
at its odd, precarious angle.

03:02:58.980 --> 03:03:00.520
SAM: Checking for traps.

03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:01.520
MATT: All right.

03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:02.560
SAM: 21.

03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:04.430
MATT: 21, does not appear to be trapped.

03:03:04.430 --> 03:03:05.810
LIAM: And is there any magical read on it

03:03:05.810 --> 03:03:08.710
from the last few minutes of my Detect Magic?

03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:09.543
MATT: Um,

03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:12.500
no, there is not.

03:03:12.500 --> 03:03:13.333
LIAM: Okay.

03:03:15.420 --> 03:03:17.270
SAM: All right.
ASHLEY: I open this one, too?

03:03:17.270 --> 03:03:18.103
SAM: Sure?

03:03:18.103 --> 03:03:19.340
TALIESIN: Back up again in the corner.

03:03:19.340 --> 03:03:20.690
TRAVIS: No weapons with these, right?

03:03:20.690 --> 03:03:21.800
MARISHA: Guard.

03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:23.750
TRAVIS: No weapons in the sarcophagi?

03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:25.110
MATT: The ones that you saw below?

03:03:25.110 --> 03:03:26.600
Or the one that you opened? No.

03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:28.950
LAURA: I bet there's one in this one.

03:03:28.950 --> 03:03:30.565
Come on, big weapon.

03:03:31.770 --> 03:03:32.960
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm just going to one hand,

03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:35.230
put one hand on my blade and then one hand

03:03:35.230 --> 03:03:36.510
and try to push it open.

03:03:36.510 --> 03:03:37.343
MATT: Okay.

03:03:37.343 --> 03:03:38.620
TALIESIN: Get myself-- oh no, I can't.

03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:39.930
I'm not going to do that, carry on.

03:03:39.930 --> 03:03:42.414
MATT: Okay. Make a strength check for me.

03:03:43.363 --> 03:03:44.196
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:03:45.212 --> 03:03:46.045
LIAM: Come on, muscles.

03:03:46.045 --> 03:03:47.080
LAURA: I'm going to guide her.

03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:47.930
You got this, Yasha.

03:03:47.930 --> 03:03:49.490
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:03:49.490 --> 03:03:50.323
Natural 20.

03:03:50.323 --> 03:03:53.173
TRAVIS: Oh. Get on it.

03:03:53.173 --> 03:03:54.320
MATT: Okay.

03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:58.070
So you push the lid

03:03:58.070 --> 03:04:00.245
relatively easily, actually.

03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:02.780
It shifts back.

03:04:02.780 --> 03:04:06.030
As it does, the weight shifts on the sarcophagus

03:04:06.030 --> 03:04:08.680
and it begins to lift up on that side.

03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:12.660
With a natural 20, yes.

03:04:12.660 --> 03:04:15.190
You catch it, but you are locked in place.

03:04:15.190 --> 03:04:17.430
And the floor, like, you're now in the process where now

03:04:17.430 --> 03:04:18.540
you can't pull it back up,

03:04:18.540 --> 03:04:20.180
but you're keeping it from toppling.

03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:22.260
And this thing weighs a lot.

03:04:22.260 --> 03:04:24.590
So you can't move and you don't know how long you have.

03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:27.220
LAURA: I'm going to go up and hold Yasha around the waist

03:04:27.220 --> 03:04:28.310
and pull back as well.

03:04:28.310 --> 03:04:30.400
MATT: I need you to make a strength check with disadvantage.

03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:32.260
Because this is now two of you pulling back

03:04:32.260 --> 03:04:34.450
what equates to maybe

03:04:34.450 --> 03:04:36.390
close to a ton and a half of stone and metal.

03:04:36.390 --> 03:04:38.140
ASHLEY: Do you want to just peek in and,

03:04:38.140 --> 03:04:39.310
peek in?

03:04:39.310 --> 03:04:41.750
LIAM: I will pull out Cat's Ire

03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:44.110
and bring the hand down to the other side

03:04:44.110 --> 03:04:45.960
of the sarcophagus and push up.

03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:47.550
MATT: Okay, well, hold on.

03:04:47.550 --> 03:04:49.190
It's going to take a second to cast that spell.

03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:50.300
You go ahead and roll your check.

03:04:50.300 --> 03:04:52.435
ASHLEY: Shit.
LAURA: Disadvantage.

03:04:55.230 --> 03:04:56.490
Saving throw or just a check?

03:04:56.490 --> 03:04:57.838
MATT: Just a check.

03:04:57.838 --> 03:04:59.038
LAURA: A seven.

03:04:59.038 --> 03:05:00.920
MATT: Seven, okay.

03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:07.730
You go to help her and Yasha as you're holding it,

03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:08.660
it goes.

03:05:08.660 --> 03:05:10.780
The whole sarcophagus

03:05:10.780 --> 03:05:13.540
peers off the edge, the stones crack and break.

03:05:13.540 --> 03:05:15.060
And you see it begin to tumble.

03:05:15.060 --> 03:05:17.000
You do create Cat's Ire.

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:18.600
I need you to go ahead and just

03:05:19.830 --> 03:05:22.130
roll a straight dexterity check for me.

03:05:22.130 --> 03:05:23.860
This is to see if you can--

03:05:23.860 --> 03:05:24.693
LIAM: Not great.

03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:28.450
That is a seven.

03:05:28.450 --> 03:05:30.790
MATT: Cat's Ire paw appears as you rush

03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:32.770
towards the edge to make eye contact

03:05:32.770 --> 03:05:34.370
with the sarcophagus to try and catch it.

03:05:34.370 --> 03:05:37.160
And as the cat's paws swoops,

03:05:37.160 --> 03:05:38.120
it meets air

03:05:38.120 --> 03:05:39.790
as the sarcophagus

03:05:39.790 --> 03:05:41.190
slams into the ground,

03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:43.755
breaks into three pieces and dust

03:05:45.190 --> 03:05:46.820
fills the space around it.

03:05:46.820 --> 03:05:48.920
SAM: We broke our loot.

03:05:48.920 --> 03:05:51.200
LIAM: I walk over to the edge and the claw floats down

03:05:51.200 --> 03:05:52.150
and I just sort of (shifting).

03:05:53.820 --> 03:05:55.280
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:05:55.280 --> 03:05:56.113
TRAVIS: Kitty litter.

03:05:57.410 --> 03:05:59.373
LAURA: Anything?
MARISHA: Anything good?

03:05:59.373 --> 03:06:01.090
MATT: Okay.

03:06:01.090 --> 03:06:03.180
It's about 20 feet below you.

03:06:03.180 --> 03:06:04.070
LIAM: Yeah.

03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:05.920
MATT: You push apart some of the pieces.

03:06:05.920 --> 03:06:08.820
You look and see what is a ruined corpse

03:06:08.820 --> 03:06:11.530
in a black, burial shroud

03:06:11.530 --> 03:06:15.668
over very, very intricate looking metallic armor.

03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:19.520
It is busted.

03:06:19.520 --> 03:06:20.353
That's what you see.

03:06:20.353 --> 03:06:21.186
LIAM: Okay.

03:06:22.240 --> 03:06:23.370
Good times, guys.

03:06:23.370 --> 03:06:25.190
LAURA: Oops.

03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:28.430
TRAVIS: Can we pull the busted looking armor out?

03:06:28.430 --> 03:06:29.290
SAM: Yeah, let's go down there.

03:06:29.290 --> 03:06:31.220
LAURA: Yeah, let's go down. We'll go down and look at it.

03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:33.620
Maybe we can flip over the sarcophagus

03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:34.860
and see if there's any--

03:06:34.860 --> 03:06:38.412
I mean, the lid and see if there's
any writing on the inside of it.

03:06:38.412 --> 03:06:40.963
Sometimes they have those things, right?

03:06:40.963 --> 03:06:42.471
In the story books.

03:06:42.471 --> 03:06:45.905
MATT: All right, you guys make your way down there to it.

03:06:45.905 --> 03:06:48.210
The lid itself is broken in, like, six pieces.

03:06:48.210 --> 03:06:50.040
The sarcophagus fell 20 feet

03:06:50.040 --> 03:06:54.313
and then just hit hard floor and stone and busted.

03:06:54.313 --> 03:06:56.055
Make an investigation check for me.

03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:59.630
SAM: Who?

03:06:59.630 --> 03:07:01.029
Jester, okay.

03:07:07.360 --> 03:07:08.193
LAURA: 18.

03:07:08.193 --> 03:07:09.330
MATT: 18, okay.

03:07:09.330 --> 03:07:11.250
Piecing some of it together, you do see

03:07:13.370 --> 03:07:14.470
on the top,

03:07:14.470 --> 03:07:17.280
a sculpture of what looked to be

03:07:17.280 --> 03:07:20.640
a knight of some kind in the same armor as

03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:23.390
the tattered corpse is adorned in.

03:07:23.390 --> 03:07:25.620
Wearing a small

03:07:25.620 --> 03:07:27.890
pointed crown on it.

03:07:27.890 --> 03:07:29.200
It doesn't look regal by any means,

03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:31.250
but it represents station and importance.

03:07:32.780 --> 03:07:34.340
Clutching blade to its chest

03:07:34.340 --> 03:07:36.430
that goes down to the length of its body.

03:07:36.430 --> 03:07:38.810
Similar design as to the

03:07:38.810 --> 03:07:40.580
symbols you saw on the other sarcophagi,

03:07:40.580 --> 03:07:42.790
as well as the entranceway there.

03:07:42.790 --> 03:07:46.220
And you see a name in Infernal that is carved across

03:07:46.220 --> 03:07:49.460
a chiseled ribbon that stretches across

03:07:49.460 --> 03:07:51.150
from one elbow to the other where it's holding

03:07:51.150 --> 03:07:52.460
the sword at the front.

03:07:52.460 --> 03:07:55.042
It says "Lord Cioro."

03:07:55.042 --> 03:07:58.531
C-I-O-R-O is what it would be, Cioro.

03:07:58.531 --> 03:08:01.256
TRAVIS: C-I-R-O?

03:08:01.256 --> 03:08:04.637
MATT: C-I-O-R-O. Cioro
LAURA: Cioro.

03:08:04.637 --> 03:08:07.820
TRAVIS: C-I-O-R-O.
LAURA: Damn it.

03:08:07.820 --> 03:08:09.380
SAM: So wait,

03:08:09.380 --> 03:08:11.680
he's just broken into a million pieces, right?

03:08:13.050 --> 03:08:14.720
This creature?

03:08:14.720 --> 03:08:17.470
TRAVIS: The sarcophagus.
MATT: The sarcophagus is busted.

03:08:17.470 --> 03:08:20.430
And the corpse inside has been

03:08:20.430 --> 03:08:22.070
heavily damaged by the process

03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:23.810
of the sarcophagus being destroyed.

03:08:23.810 --> 03:08:25.140
TRAVIS: What does the armor look like?

03:08:25.140 --> 03:08:28.010
Even though it's been probably dented and--

03:08:28.010 --> 03:08:30.630
MATT: In similar ceremonial way to the other ones.

03:08:30.630 --> 03:08:31.680
It's the armor itself.

03:08:31.680 --> 03:08:32.513
It's full plate.

03:08:32.513 --> 03:08:35.070
It's a full, awesome suit of full plate.

03:08:35.070 --> 03:08:37.940
Really intricately carved with designs and runes.

03:08:37.940 --> 03:08:39.150
And you can see that the inside of it

03:08:39.150 --> 03:08:40.830
probably had a lot of old herbs

03:08:40.830 --> 03:08:42.540
and things that were placed around the corpse

03:08:42.540 --> 03:08:44.875
when it was buried, but all that's been also

03:08:44.875 --> 03:08:47.840
scattered and thrown askew in the space around it

03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:49.210
LAURA: What about its blade?

03:08:49.210 --> 03:08:52.360
I feel like he would have been buried with his sword.

03:08:52.360 --> 03:08:56.310
MATT: You do find the hilt and handle of a blade.

03:08:56.310 --> 03:08:58.450
TRAVIS: Hilt and handle.

03:08:58.450 --> 03:08:59.283
LAURA: Okay.

03:09:01.060 --> 03:09:03.260
SAM: Did you guys check this for magic as well?

03:09:04.450 --> 03:09:07.100
ASHLEY: Is his skull still intact and everything?

03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:09.783
MATT: Nope.

03:09:10.770 --> 03:09:11.920
Skull is crushed.

03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:13.720
SAM: Can it be put back together

03:09:13.720 --> 03:09:15.237
so we can talk to it?

03:09:16.150 --> 03:09:17.500
TALIESIN: Once it's done, it's done.

03:09:19.194 --> 03:09:21.229
TRAVIS: Can't mend a skull?

03:09:21.229 --> 03:09:23.290
LAURA: I feel like we could have banished him,

03:09:23.290 --> 03:09:26.100
and he would have gone back to his home plane.

03:09:26.100 --> 03:09:27.500
I'm feeling really guilty right now.

03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:29.410
TRAVIS: The corpse?

03:09:29.410 --> 03:09:30.930
LAURA: The ghost.

03:09:30.930 --> 03:09:32.515
The shadow creature.

03:09:33.610 --> 03:09:34.960
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:38.488
LAURA: He probably would have been real happy.

03:09:38.488 --> 03:09:40.112
TALIESIN: You're still sad about that tree, aren't you?

03:09:40.112 --> 03:09:41.330
TRAVIS: Do we want to-- did we look at it?

03:09:41.330 --> 03:09:43.230
See if the hilt and handle is magical?

03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:45.230
TALIESIN: I'm a big believer in always--

03:09:45.230 --> 03:09:47.440
LIAM: I didn't get a read on the outside of the sarcophagus.

03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:48.840
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right it would have--

03:09:48.840 --> 03:09:50.328
SAM: You scanned this one too?
MATT: Not magical.

03:09:50.328 --> 03:09:51.340
LIAM: There's no lead or anything.

03:09:51.340 --> 03:09:52.770
SAM: Okay.

03:09:52.770 --> 03:09:54.600
TRAVIS: Can we grab it?
MATT: Make an arcana check.

03:09:55.670 --> 03:09:57.610
TALIESIN: Oh, we're grabbing it.

03:09:57.610 --> 03:10:00.490
LIAM: Nope. 12. I rolled a two.

03:10:00.490 --> 03:10:02.110
MATT: Okay, yeah, you--

03:10:02.110 --> 03:10:03.802
it just looks like a busted blade.

03:10:03.802 --> 03:10:05.010
LAURA: I'm going to take it.

03:10:05.010 --> 03:10:05.868
MATT: Okay.

03:10:05.868 --> 03:10:07.070
TALIESIN: Take a look at it in a little bit.

03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:08.768
MATT: All right.

03:10:08.768 --> 03:10:11.110
SAM: Are there any skulls or anything that we can talk to?

03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:14.080
TALIESIN: I say we go open sarcophagus.

03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:15.900
LAURA: Well, we're on the ground floor again,

03:10:15.900 --> 03:10:18.478
so might as well talk to the one we uncovered.

03:10:18.478 --> 03:10:19.753
TALIESIN: Well, there's a third one too.
TRAVIS: The breastplate,

03:10:19.753 --> 03:10:21.920
like, I know there are runes and designs on it.

03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:24.100
Did it look like at one time it was capable of magic

03:10:24.100 --> 03:10:25.580
or more just ornate?

03:10:25.580 --> 03:10:27.261
MATT: It's just ornate and ornamental.

03:10:27.261 --> 03:10:28.218
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:10:30.010 --> 03:10:31.844
Dope-ass plate armor.

03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:36.520
TALIESIN: Let's check box number three.

03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:38.090
LIAM: Yeah, are we going to bother with every single one?

03:10:38.090 --> 03:10:40.370
Are we going to do our due diligence?

03:10:40.370 --> 03:10:42.330
TALIESIN: And we'll take one of them with us.

03:10:42.330 --> 03:10:43.950
LAURA: Sorry, Yasha.

03:10:43.950 --> 03:10:45.860
ASHLEY: Well, that's--

03:10:50.093 --> 03:10:52.460
I should have moved it in or something.

03:10:52.460 --> 03:10:54.410
TRAVIS: Do we have room in the bag for this armor?

03:10:54.410 --> 03:10:55.720
I don't know, I just feel like

03:10:55.720 --> 03:10:58.940
if this was from somewhere else and it's decorative armor,

03:10:58.940 --> 03:11:01.010
if we could find someone talented enough to repair it,

03:11:01.010 --> 03:11:03.850
it might be worth something or a trade of interest

03:11:03.850 --> 03:11:05.575
to someone at some point.

03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:08.513
LAURA: If you want to take it.

03:11:08.513 --> 03:11:09.346
TRAVIS: Is that all right?

03:11:09.346 --> 03:11:11.012
LAURA: I feel like--
SAM: I think it's fine.

03:11:11.012 --> 03:11:12.800
For some reason, I feel like

03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:16.260
the body itself is more important than the armor.

03:11:16.260 --> 03:11:18.500
LAURA: Yeah, and it's destroyed.

03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:20.080
TRAVIS: Caduceus?

03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:23.110
LIAM: What does this tell us about the questions we have

03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:24.718
for our purpose here?

03:11:26.660 --> 03:11:30.550
It doesn't teach us anything new about Vokodo.

03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:32.770
This just seems like another slice

03:11:32.770 --> 03:11:34.270
of the multiverse.
MARISHA: Yeah, it just feels like it reaffirms

03:11:34.270 --> 03:11:35.470
what we already know.

03:11:35.470 --> 03:11:37.105
LIAM: Yeah. Slice of onion.

03:11:37.105 --> 03:11:39.320
SAM: We can ask him questions.

03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:41.500
He would be able to tell us where he's from,

03:11:41.500 --> 03:11:43.750
what happened, how he got here.

03:11:43.750 --> 03:11:46.833
LIAM: Yeah, but this tower looks like it was just cut

03:11:46.833 --> 03:11:50.420
from whatever reality it was in.
MARISHA: I don't think it has anything to do with Vokodo.

03:11:50.420 --> 03:11:52.130
I mean, we can ask and we can learn

03:11:52.130 --> 03:11:53.660
and get more further confirmation.

03:11:53.660 --> 03:11:55.200
TRAVIS: Let's do it, let's ask.

03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:56.460
LAURA: You have Speak with Dead?

03:11:56.460 --> 03:11:57.650
TALIESIN: I can tomorrow.

03:11:57.650 --> 03:11:59.060
LAURA: I can tomorrow, might as well

03:11:59.060 --> 03:12:00.880
take a skull with us or something.

03:12:00.880 --> 03:12:02.462
TALIESIN: Yeah, my thought.

03:12:03.330 --> 03:12:05.070
LIAM: How late in the day is it now?

03:12:05.070 --> 03:12:06.718
MATT: At this point it's

03:12:08.492 --> 03:12:09.441
mid-afternoon.

03:12:09.441 --> 03:12:11.207
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: It'd be, like,

03:12:11.207 --> 03:12:14.290
three to four o'clock-ish, 3:30.

03:12:14.290 --> 03:12:16.260
TRAVIS: Do we need to mend this crushed skull?

03:12:17.210 --> 03:12:20.240
LAURA: I don't know if I can mend this.

03:12:20.240 --> 03:12:22.200
It seems like it's in a bunch of pieces,

03:12:22.200 --> 03:12:25.590
the skull, or is it just cracked?

03:12:27.550 --> 03:12:28.820
MATT: Let me--

03:12:31.430 --> 03:12:34.210
"Repairs a single break or tear in an object."

03:12:34.210 --> 03:12:36.300
LAURA: Yeah, I just didn't know if it was, like--

03:12:37.260 --> 03:12:39.080
MATT: Yeah, no that skull is--

03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:41.166
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Let's try one of the retainers.

03:12:41.166 --> 03:12:42.100
MATT: Yeah.

03:12:42.100 --> 03:12:43.360
TALIESIN: Let's open the other retainer box,

03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:44.700
that's what I say.

03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:46.595
SAM: Sure.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:12:46.595 --> 03:12:49.080
SAM: Well, we got the first one's already open, right?

03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:52.492
TALIESIN: Let's check, no sense leaving one closed.

03:12:52.492 --> 03:12:54.930
ASHLEY: And then there's two more on the third level?

03:12:54.930 --> 03:12:56.790
MATT: Yeah. One and then one, yeah.

03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:57.623
SAM: All right.

03:12:57.623 --> 03:13:00.050
TALIESIN: Oh, maybe go to the top, then.

03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:01.539
LAURA: Let's just do this one right here.

03:13:01.539 --> 03:13:03.290
MARISHA: It's all the same, yeah.

03:13:03.290 --> 03:13:04.665
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:13:04.665 --> 03:13:06.140
ASHLEY: I think he was the big boy.

03:13:06.140 --> 03:13:07.400
LIAM: Did you just mime opening it up?

03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:08.760
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: One's open.

03:13:08.760 --> 03:13:10.580
MATT: So you opened the other sarcophagus right there?

03:13:10.580 --> 03:13:11.840
LAURA: Yeah, the third one.

03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:12.740
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Getting it done.

03:13:12.740 --> 03:13:14.530
MATT: You push it open.

03:13:14.530 --> 03:13:16.970
And you see another similar corpse

03:13:16.970 --> 03:13:18.710
dressed in the same burial vestments

03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:20.140
as the other retainer.

03:13:20.140 --> 03:13:21.440
MATT: Make a--

03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:22.570
LAURA: Uh oh.

03:13:22.570 --> 03:13:23.690
TRAVIS: No way.

03:13:23.690 --> 03:13:25.300
MATT: Make a charisma saving throw.

03:13:25.300 --> 03:13:27.495
LAURA: Of course the one that we don't check.

03:13:27.495 --> 03:13:28.371
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:13:28.371 --> 03:13:31.367
SAM: Wait, you just opened it?
MARISHA: And it's you again! (laughs)

03:13:31.367 --> 03:13:32.200
TRAVIS: I'm sure it's fine.

03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:34.100
SAM: What could go wrong?

03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:35.810
TRAVIS: Maybe you'll just be scared.

03:13:37.400 --> 03:13:38.490
MARISHA: Please, please make it.

03:13:38.490 --> 03:13:40.462
LAURA: 16.
SAM: Oh, thank god.

03:13:40.462 --> 03:13:42.190
MATT: 16, okay.

03:13:42.190 --> 03:13:43.930
As you lean in

03:13:43.930 --> 03:13:45.310
from the corpse that is there,

03:13:45.310 --> 03:13:46.790
the skeleton, you watch

03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:49.953
suddenly the ghostly visage--

03:13:49.953 --> 03:13:52.150
one of the ghosts that was in the battle before

03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:53.970
emerges from the body and (gasps)

03:13:53.970 --> 03:13:55.820
reaches towards you and you push back.

03:13:55.820 --> 03:13:58.800
And it shrinks back into the corpse.

03:13:58.800 --> 03:14:01.220
You get the sense that the three ghosts that fled

03:14:01.220 --> 03:14:03.230
may have fled to their sarcophagus.

03:14:03.230 --> 03:14:05.710
LAURA: Oh, they went to their home.

03:14:05.710 --> 03:14:08.291
Oh, so maybe we can send this one home?

03:14:08.291 --> 03:14:10.460
SAM: Wait, why do we care about this one?

03:14:10.460 --> 03:14:13.170
It was a ghost that we punched in the face.

03:14:13.170 --> 03:14:14.920
Ask it questions.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:18.100
LAURA: Well, now I can't take its head.

03:14:18.100 --> 03:14:19.340
He's in it.

03:14:20.910 --> 03:14:23.655
Go take the other dead head.

03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:26.330
MARISHA: Nice.

03:14:26.330 --> 03:14:28.520
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over

03:14:28.520 --> 03:14:30.583
to the box we just opened.

03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:33.740
We feel a little bad about that.

03:14:33.740 --> 03:14:35.490
I don't suppose you'd want to talk?

03:14:36.920 --> 03:14:38.950
I feel like that got off into the wrong foot.

03:14:40.630 --> 03:14:42.250
MATT: No response.

03:14:42.250 --> 03:14:43.810
TALIESIN: No.

03:14:43.810 --> 03:14:45.985
LAURA: What if we could send you home?

03:14:46.850 --> 03:14:48.141
MATT: No response.

03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:51.730
TRAVIS: Yasha?

03:14:51.730 --> 03:14:54.772
ASHLEY: No, I was just going to say what he said.

03:14:54.772 --> 03:14:56.660
LIAM: Can we see the volcano peering up

03:14:56.660 --> 03:14:58.630
over the mist in the distance from here?

03:14:58.630 --> 03:15:00.236
MATT: Right now,

03:15:00.236 --> 03:15:02.140
the fog that surrounds this space is still

03:15:02.140 --> 03:15:04.080
too thick to look beyond the horizon

03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:05.530
to see the mountain from where you are.

03:15:05.530 --> 03:15:07.330
You'd have to get some--

03:15:07.330 --> 03:15:08.690
actually, if you climb up towards the tower,

03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:10.580
you might be able to have a vantage point to see.

03:15:10.580 --> 03:15:11.570
But from where you're standing now,

03:15:11.570 --> 03:15:12.870
you would not be able to.

03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:14.362
MARISHA: You want me to go?

03:15:18.680 --> 03:15:19.513
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:15:19.513 --> 03:15:22.030
TRAVIS: And our history buffs don't
know anything about the name?

03:15:22.030 --> 03:15:23.268
LIAM: I can't get up there right now.

03:15:23.268 --> 03:15:24.817
TRAVIS: Cioro or whatever.

03:15:24.817 --> 03:15:26.083
MARISHA: Cioro?

03:15:26.083 --> 03:15:27.350
Yeah, do we do recognize...?

03:15:27.350 --> 03:15:28.525
MATT: You can make a history check, if you want to.

03:15:28.525 --> 03:15:29.358
MARISHA: Another history check?

03:15:29.358 --> 03:15:31.470
SAM: It would have to be, like, a 50.

03:15:31.470 --> 03:15:32.710
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

03:15:32.710 --> 03:15:34.730
Big money.

03:15:34.730 --> 03:15:35.970
TRAVIS: Boom.

03:15:35.970 --> 03:15:37.770
MARISHA: Yeah, 21?

03:15:37.770 --> 03:15:40.603
MATT: Doesn't ring a bell.
MARISHA: I think that's weaker than his.

03:15:42.654 --> 03:15:43.583
All right, I'll climb--

03:15:43.583 --> 03:15:44.574
SAM: We've wasted a day.

03:15:44.574 --> 03:15:46.150
MARISHA: -- climb the tower,

03:15:46.150 --> 03:15:48.550
see if the volcano is still mad at us.

03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:50.560
LIAM: You know what, I'll send from Frumpkin up with you.

03:15:50.560 --> 03:15:51.500
MATT: Okay, you both head up.

03:15:51.500 --> 03:15:52.520
LIAM: He'll land on your shoulder.

03:15:52.520 --> 03:15:54.030
MATT: Okay, glancing over you can see

03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:55.620
the smoke is still billowing.

03:15:55.620 --> 03:15:57.340
Not more intense, not less intense,

03:15:57.340 --> 03:15:59.730
but consistent with the recent

03:16:01.130 --> 03:16:04.410
mild fury you seem to sense from

03:16:04.410 --> 03:16:07.670
the Vokodo entity that exists deep within.

03:16:07.670 --> 03:16:10.917
LIAM: Is there anything we missed between here and there

03:16:12.530 --> 03:16:14.883
in the landscape that stands out?

03:16:15.940 --> 03:16:17.551
MATT: Not that you're aware of at the moment.

03:16:17.551 --> 03:16:19.109
Not from where you stand.

03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:24.100
TALIESIN: I'd like to see the rest
of this village on our way out.

03:16:24.100 --> 03:16:25.450
Any of the other buildings.

03:16:26.890 --> 03:16:28.160
TRAVIS: Oracs, Scario.

03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:29.870
MARISHA: I don't know what else we can learn

03:16:29.870 --> 03:16:31.070
from any of this.

03:16:31.070 --> 03:16:33.360
SAM: Circle up, huddle up, come on guys,

03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:36.360
share our brains here.

03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:38.610
Mind-meld, come on, what are we missing?

03:16:38.610 --> 03:16:40.360
TRAVIS: Because right now Vokodo just sounds like

03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:43.160
he's actually warning us about dangerous areas.

03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:45.720
I mean, besides the thing that was hiding the ship.

03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:48.130
What would he not want someone to see here?

03:16:48.130 --> 03:16:49.420
LAURA: I know, he's hiding something.

03:16:49.420 --> 03:16:51.890
SAM: Why would he bring this piece here?

03:16:51.890 --> 03:16:53.160
Maybe he gets to choose.

03:16:53.160 --> 03:16:55.020
LAURA: How close was that crack in the earth

03:16:55.020 --> 03:16:57.180
that we saw to the Ruins?

03:16:57.180 --> 03:16:58.965
Was it the whole other area?
MATT: Oh, it was quite far.

03:16:58.965 --> 03:16:59.898
It was a whole other area.

03:16:59.898 --> 03:17:02.060
And if you ask Vilya about that, she actually

03:17:03.880 --> 03:17:06.210
confirms that that crack is--

03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:08.635
where is that here?

03:17:08.635 --> 03:17:12.190
MARISHA: He doesn't necessarily have to be hiding anything.

03:17:12.190 --> 03:17:14.230
MATT: "That's actually a part of the Winding Core."

03:17:14.230 --> 03:17:15.110
LAURA: The Winding Core?

03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:18.030
MATT: "That chasm runs from that northwestern side,

03:17:18.030 --> 03:17:19.020
"underneath the mountain,

03:17:19.020 --> 03:17:22.900
"and then peeks out on the southern, southeast side,

03:17:22.900 --> 03:17:24.900
"which is where most of our mining is done."

03:17:24.900 --> 03:17:27.190
SAM: Where's the Winding Core start?

03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:29.620
What entrance is she talking about?

03:17:29.620 --> 03:17:31.350
MATT: The chasm that was seen earlier.

03:17:31.350 --> 03:17:32.320
LAURA: We flew over a thing.

03:17:32.320 --> 03:17:34.730
LIAM: Yeah, Beauregard and owl-Jester

03:17:34.730 --> 03:17:36.980
spotted a crack in the earth.

03:17:36.980 --> 03:17:39.390
MARISHA: I mean, if I was like, you know,

03:17:39.390 --> 03:17:42.640
trying to pass as a god, I'd be like,

03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:44.910
yeah, I'm going to give you a cookie for this one

03:17:44.910 --> 03:17:47.200
and say don't go to where you might die.

03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:48.570
Because that's going to make me look

03:17:48.570 --> 03:17:50.410
like I'm an empathetic god.

03:17:50.410 --> 03:17:52.520
MATT: "Vokodo seemed pretty emphatic

03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:54.750
"about not coming here

03:17:54.750 --> 03:17:59.265
"in the same way that he was saying to not go to--"

03:17:59.265 --> 03:18:00.756
LAURA: Heaven's Falls.
TALIESIN: Is there anything below the tower?

03:18:00.756 --> 03:18:02.040
MARISHA: Right, but you can be

03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:04.180
hiding something at Heaven's Fall,

03:18:04.180 --> 03:18:06.250
but then use

03:18:06.250 --> 03:18:09.200
"don't go here because it's dangerous at the Ruins"--

03:18:09.200 --> 03:18:10.121
MATT: "That's true."

03:18:10.121 --> 03:18:12.285
MARISHA: -- as a way to mask that you're hiding

03:18:12.285 --> 03:18:13.557
anything at all at one location.

03:18:13.557 --> 03:18:15.820
SAM: Or there's evidence here to prove

03:18:15.820 --> 03:18:17.887
that he is not what he says he is.

03:18:17.887 --> 03:18:20.937
LAURA: What if what he was fleeing from was whatever god

03:18:20.937 --> 03:18:22.753
these people were serving?

03:18:23.810 --> 03:18:27.486
SAM: These people aren't from the Astral whatever, Sea.

03:18:27.486 --> 03:18:29.530
TALIESIN: The Astral Sea is kind of--

03:18:29.530 --> 03:18:32.717
I mean, everything's weird.
MARISHA: The Astral Sea's kind of like--

03:18:32.717 --> 03:18:34.260
it's like the packing peanuts

03:18:34.260 --> 03:18:37.150
in between other planes.

03:18:37.150 --> 03:18:38.880
LAURA: What if he'd gone into another plane

03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:40.975
and he pissed off something else?

03:18:40.975 --> 03:18:43.070
LIAM: You pack things with peanuts?
LAURA: Maybe Vokodo had the ability

03:18:43.070 --> 03:18:45.590
to punch through the Astral Plane.

03:18:45.590 --> 03:18:46.423
MARISHA: They're cheap.

03:18:46.423 --> 03:18:47.770
TRAVIS: We should change our perspective.

03:18:47.770 --> 03:18:50.640
You and Frumpkin should go up to the top.

03:18:50.640 --> 03:18:53.930
See if it looks different from up there, down here.

03:18:53.930 --> 03:18:55.880
MARISHA: I did. Didn't I?
LIAM: Yeah, that happened.

03:18:55.880 --> 03:18:57.757
MATT: Yeah, you guys looked up.

03:18:57.757 --> 03:18:59.715
TRAVIS: I'm paying attention.

03:18:59.715 --> 03:19:01.510
MARISHA: He's still just mad.

03:19:01.510 --> 03:19:03.140
TALIESIN: There's nothing below
the ground floor of the tower.

03:19:03.140 --> 03:19:05.900
There's no doors on the bottom, there's no--

03:19:05.900 --> 03:19:07.890
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:19:07.890 --> 03:19:10.160
SAM: If I were Vokodo on the run from something--

03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:12.620
TALIESIN: Would anyone want to--
SAM: This thing was here,

03:19:12.620 --> 03:19:15.330
why would I not want anyone to go here?

03:19:15.330 --> 03:19:17.470
TALIESIN: 12. Wait, nope.

03:19:17.470 --> 03:19:19.080
Yes, 12.

03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:20.400
MATT: 12, okay.

03:19:20.400 --> 03:19:22.233
Don't really find anything.

03:19:23.260 --> 03:19:25.800
Passive investigation in Beauregard is very high.

03:19:25.800 --> 03:19:29.140
As part of this discussion and piecing things together,

03:19:29.140 --> 03:19:30.720
you begin to think.

03:19:30.720 --> 03:19:32.430
If a creature had punched through and

03:19:32.430 --> 03:19:37.030
dragged other pieces away from their homes,

03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:39.700
whatever was dragged along and misplaced

03:19:39.700 --> 03:19:42.692
would be very angry that it was misplaced.

03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:47.430
If something was very angry that it was misplaced,

03:19:47.430 --> 03:19:49.140
it would be prone to be an enemy

03:19:49.140 --> 03:19:50.840
of the thing that brought it here.

03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:55.710
Maybe Vokodo didn't want anyone to make friends with

03:19:55.710 --> 03:19:58.540
or allies with the spirits

03:19:58.540 --> 03:19:59.900
that were displaced.

03:19:59.900 --> 03:20:03.140
SAM: We could have. Could have teamed up.

03:20:03.140 --> 03:20:04.708
MATT: But--
SAM: We punched it in the face

03:20:04.708 --> 03:20:05.901
and then threw it off a balcony.

03:20:05.901 --> 03:20:07.975
MATT: The leader has been destroyed.

03:20:09.690 --> 03:20:13.180
The lord vanquished, the spirit scattered.

03:20:13.180 --> 03:20:14.270
MARISHA: It is not my fault.

03:20:14.270 --> 03:20:15.637
SAM: No, it's not your fault.
MATT: No, no.

03:20:15.637 --> 03:20:16.470
MARISHA: I punched it in the face.

03:20:16.470 --> 03:20:18.250
MATT: It is not your fault.

03:20:18.250 --> 03:20:20.242
MARISHA: It went (hisses)

03:20:20.242 --> 03:20:22.910
at me and, you know.

03:20:22.910 --> 03:20:24.774
LIAM: Yeah, when you think about it--
ASHLEY: Normally that's scary.

03:20:24.774 --> 03:20:26.349
MATT: There was

03:20:28.320 --> 03:20:29.750
very little attempt

03:20:30.730 --> 03:20:32.850
to speak with,

03:20:32.850 --> 03:20:37.490
beseech, and communicate with these creatures.

03:20:37.490 --> 03:20:41.320
And the path of wanton destruction was chosen instead.

03:20:41.320 --> 03:20:42.590
TRAVIS: Wanton destruction.

03:20:42.590 --> 03:20:43.550
MARISHA: That feels

03:20:44.640 --> 03:20:47.640
so blown out of proportion

03:20:47.640 --> 03:20:49.310
of what actually happened.
MATT: It's fine!

03:20:49.310 --> 03:20:51.053
No, I know.

03:20:51.053 --> 03:20:53.725
You gather with your investigation that perhaps

03:20:54.933 --> 03:20:57.126
an opportunity to make

03:20:57.126 --> 03:20:59.012
some allies here has passed.

03:21:00.260 --> 03:21:01.570
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool.

03:21:02.520 --> 03:21:03.850
SAM: It's okay.

03:21:03.850 --> 03:21:05.040
We gave it a shot.

03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:07.880
TRAVIS: Where else are we not supposed to go on the island?

03:21:07.880 --> 03:21:08.770
SAM: That's pretty much it.

03:21:08.770 --> 03:21:11.010
MARISHA: Yeah, pretty much it.

03:21:11.010 --> 03:21:13.370
ASHLEY: So that spire that we were seeing, that's the--

03:21:13.370 --> 03:21:15.653
MATT: That's the tower you're at now, yeah.

03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:18.900
SAM: Okay, we've checked off all the boxes.

03:21:18.900 --> 03:21:20.800
We know what we have to do now.

03:21:20.800 --> 03:21:21.633
We sleep.

03:21:21.633 --> 03:21:22.780
We feast.

03:21:22.780 --> 03:21:24.217
We kill Vokodo.

03:21:26.180 --> 03:21:29.710
No allies to help. We don't need 'em!

03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:32.530
MARISHA: I tried to empathize with ghosts before.

03:21:32.530 --> 03:21:33.980
TRAVIS: The only thing we haven't done

03:21:33.980 --> 03:21:36.775
is checked out the Winding Core.

03:21:36.775 --> 03:21:38.830
MARISHA: I mean, it's just a mine, though.

03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:39.663
What are we going to get?

03:21:39.663 --> 03:21:42.170
TRAVIS: Just a mine that we haven't checked out?

03:21:42.170 --> 03:21:44.787
MATT: "It's not just a mine."
ASHLEY: Okay, wait, hold on.

03:21:44.787 --> 03:21:48.230
MATT: "It is, in its own way a
sliver, but with the Underdark."

03:21:49.430 --> 03:21:51.400
TRAVIS: But pissed off things from the Underdark

03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:54.008
that might be mad that it got drug.

03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:56.840
MARISHA: Is that true?

03:21:56.840 --> 03:21:58.623
MATT: "We don't go that deep."

03:21:59.480 --> 03:22:02.710
TRAVIS: But you also haven't been yourself for 25 years.

03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:04.000
MATT: "That's true."

03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:05.740
TALIESIN: Is it on the way?

03:22:05.740 --> 03:22:08.480
SAM: But there are beings down there?

03:22:08.480 --> 03:22:11.613
MATT: "There are all sorts of horrible things down there."

03:22:15.220 --> 03:22:17.768
ASHLEY: What is it, Yasha?
TRAVIS: Maybe they're looking to get even.

03:22:17.768 --> 03:22:20.610
ASHLEY: So this--

03:22:20.610 --> 03:22:23.810
explain the-- how this looks--

03:22:23.810 --> 03:22:26.010
it looks familiar to the architecture

03:22:26.010 --> 03:22:27.752
that was, like, around...

03:22:29.020 --> 03:22:30.537
MATT: Around Rosohna.

03:22:32.360 --> 03:22:35.030
ASHLEY: Like around in the Barbed Fields area?

03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:36.020
MATT: South of the Barbed Fields.

03:22:36.020 --> 03:22:37.300
There's an area called the Ghostlands

03:22:37.300 --> 03:22:39.050
that surrounds Rosohna,

03:22:39.050 --> 03:22:40.610
which is where a bunch of ruins

03:22:40.610 --> 03:22:43.760
from the final battles of the Calamity remained.

03:22:43.760 --> 03:22:46.150
It's similar to those, though not quite.

03:22:46.150 --> 03:22:49.590
ASHLEY: Like where all those shards were?

03:22:49.590 --> 03:22:52.970
MATT: Yeah, like broken--
TRAVIS: Like spines, spires

03:22:52.970 --> 03:22:54.320
MATT: Well, there's the Barbed Fields

03:22:54.320 --> 03:22:56.210
that are large pointed barbs.

03:22:56.210 --> 03:22:57.660
These are just--

03:22:57.660 --> 03:22:59.230
it was just ruins and buildings

03:22:59.230 --> 03:23:03.170
from what was once the central city of the Betrayer Gods

03:23:03.170 --> 03:23:05.920
during the Calamity, that was then destroyed

03:23:05.920 --> 03:23:07.337
and left to ruin.

03:23:08.310 --> 03:23:09.202
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:23:09.202 --> 03:23:12.006
LIAM: It was an ice cream scoop of another dimension.

03:23:12.006 --> 03:23:13.450
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:23:13.450 --> 03:23:15.110
TRAVIS: I mean,

03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:17.860
we don't need to go shopping in the place

03:23:17.860 --> 03:23:19.100
with all the terrible creatures.

03:23:19.100 --> 03:23:21.050
LAURA: I think that the terrible creatures

03:23:21.050 --> 03:23:22.770
will be much harder to reason with

03:23:22.770 --> 03:23:25.437
than sentient beings here.

03:23:26.277 --> 03:23:27.920
MATT: "I think you might be right."

03:23:29.230 --> 03:23:32.530
LIAM: And the Underdark-- that's this plane.

03:23:32.530 --> 03:23:35.980
That's just a fissure into the birth.

03:23:35.980 --> 03:23:39.963
It's not like Vokodo has

03:23:39.963 --> 03:23:43.210
harmed whatever's down there, that we know of.

03:23:43.210 --> 03:23:44.660
It's not part of this.

03:23:44.660 --> 03:23:46.280
SAM: You know what?

03:23:46.280 --> 03:23:49.575
Let's not be too down on Beau, all right?

03:23:50.420 --> 03:23:52.633
She's fine.

03:23:52.633 --> 03:23:54.646
But also, look.

03:23:54.646 --> 03:23:58.193
MARISHA: I feel like no one said
that until you did just now.

03:23:58.193 --> 03:24:00.220
SAM: I'm just saying we shouldn't be--

03:24:00.220 --> 03:24:01.208
TRAVIS: Drag her.

03:24:01.208 --> 03:24:02.970
MARISHA: Right, so once again,

03:24:02.970 --> 03:24:05.040
bringing up a point that no one said.

03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:07.065
SAM: Then we're all in agreement.

03:24:09.205 --> 03:24:10.649
Here's the point.

03:24:10.649 --> 03:24:11.630
Here's the point.

03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:14.020
The thing that we just met

03:24:14.020 --> 03:24:17.637
and could have allied ourself with:

03:24:17.637 --> 03:24:20.350
We killed it in 18 seconds!

03:24:20.350 --> 03:24:21.183
MARISHA: Right.

03:24:21.183 --> 03:24:23.930
SAM: It couldn't have helped us that much anyway!

03:24:23.930 --> 03:24:25.460
We're much more powerful than it.

03:24:25.460 --> 03:24:26.293
We don't need it.

03:24:26.293 --> 03:24:28.020
Let's go fucking kill Vokodo.

03:24:28.020 --> 03:24:30.610
MARISHA: I said, fuck Vokodo.

03:24:30.610 --> 03:24:32.890
I'm just going to stand by that.

03:24:32.890 --> 03:24:34.660
And no one else said anything.

03:24:34.660 --> 03:24:35.493
LAURA: I did, too.

03:24:35.493 --> 03:24:36.390
I said, I could

03:24:36.390 --> 03:24:37.480
and he said, "How?"

03:24:37.480 --> 03:24:39.040
And then we attacked them.

03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:40.990
MARISHA: Well, no one anything afterwards.

03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:44.490
LAURA: Sure, anyway, not a big deal.

03:24:44.490 --> 03:24:47.790
MARISHA: Okay, everyone seems to be making it a big deal.

03:24:47.790 --> 03:24:49.680
LAURA: No, it's not a big deal, though.

03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:52.300
MARISHA: The DM just made it a big deal.

03:24:52.300 --> 03:24:53.940
SAM: It's not a big deal.

03:24:53.940 --> 03:24:56.350
MATT: I was clarifying because there was some confusion

03:24:56.350 --> 03:24:57.410
as to what may have transpired here

03:24:57.410 --> 03:24:59.050
and I didn't want to talk in circles.
SAM: We're talking about it so much

03:24:59.050 --> 03:25:01.303
because it's so not a big deal.

03:25:01.303 --> 03:25:04.021
TRAVIS: Yeah, you shit the bed--
LAURA: It's not a big deal.

03:25:04.021 --> 03:25:06.187
TRAVIS: -- but we can clean the sheets.

03:25:06.187 --> 03:25:07.880
LAURA: Beau, no. No shitting happened.

03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:09.540
It is fine.

03:25:09.540 --> 03:25:10.550
Here's the thing.

03:25:10.550 --> 03:25:12.436
SAM: No shitting.
LAURA: Veth makes a really good point.

03:25:12.436 --> 03:25:13.652
MARISHA: Fuck you, Veth.

03:25:13.652 --> 03:25:16.772
LAURA: We totally beat it super duper easy.

03:25:16.772 --> 03:25:19.000
I didn't even have any of my high level spells,

03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.080
neither did Caduceus.

03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:23.900
And Vilya, she didn't do anything.

03:25:23.900 --> 03:25:26.110
So when she goes in against Vokodo with us,

03:25:26.110 --> 03:25:26.980
she'll be fighting.

03:25:26.980 --> 03:25:29.522
It's like, we got a free ally with Vilya.

03:25:30.450 --> 03:25:31.867
LIAM: Look sometimes in the heat--

03:25:31.867 --> 03:25:33.367
MARISHA: I feel like you're just as upset

03:25:33.367 --> 03:25:34.200
and you're trying to make it better.

03:25:34.200 --> 03:25:35.578
LAURA: I'm not upset at all.

03:25:35.578 --> 03:25:37.647
MARISHA: I can tell, Jester.

03:25:37.647 --> 03:25:39.807
LAURA: Beau, I'm not.
TALIESIN: I'm not.

03:25:40.840 --> 03:25:42.515
LIAM: Hindsight--
LAURA: I'm trying to defend you.

03:25:42.515 --> 03:25:46.327
LIAM: Hindsight is 20-20, especially in 2020.

03:25:47.230 --> 03:25:48.340
Okay?

03:25:48.340 --> 03:25:49.706
Sometimes you kill a horse

03:25:49.706 --> 03:25:53.160
that you did not need to kill.
MARISHA: 2020 was two thousand years ago.

03:25:53.160 --> 03:25:54.850
LIAM: Sometimes you throw a knife into the back

03:25:54.850 --> 03:25:57.034
of a friendly nothic's head.

03:25:57.034 --> 03:25:58.930
He could have had a friendly story for you to know.

03:25:58.930 --> 03:26:01.174
You don't know.
SAM: These are strange hypotheticals.

03:26:01.174 --> 03:26:03.639
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a deep cut.

03:26:03.639 --> 03:26:05.640
That was good. Nothic.

03:26:05.640 --> 03:26:07.577
LIAM: Feels pretty fresh to me.

03:26:09.285 --> 03:26:10.673
TRAVIS: What horse?

03:26:10.673 --> 03:26:12.170
What horse did we kill?

03:26:12.170 --> 03:26:13.780
LIAM: We?

03:26:13.780 --> 03:26:14.855
There was no "we" who killed a horse.

03:26:14.855 --> 03:26:16.429
<i>I</i> killed a horse.

03:26:16.429 --> 03:26:19.487
(laughter)

03:26:19.487 --> 03:26:21.271
SAM: Lesson learned.

03:26:21.271 --> 03:26:22.914
Not that there needed to be a lesson!

03:26:22.914 --> 03:26:25.259
There's no lesson!

03:26:25.259 --> 03:26:26.843
ASHLEY: No lesson.
SAM: There's no lesson to be learned!

03:26:26.843 --> 03:26:29.072
ASHLEY: No lesson learned.
SAM: Nothing learned!

03:26:29.072 --> 03:26:30.750
Tomorrow we kill Vokodo.

03:26:30.750 --> 03:26:32.303
TRAVIS: God, you fucked up.
SAM: At dawn.

03:26:32.303 --> 03:26:34.040
(laughter)

03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:36.930
LAURA: We're probably safe to camp here, though.

03:26:36.930 --> 03:26:38.570
TALIESIN: Do we want to get part way?

03:26:38.570 --> 03:26:39.500
SAM: That's right! You made us--

03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:41.200
MATT: Seemed to act like the first punch

03:26:41.200 --> 03:26:42.667
stopped a possible conversation.

03:26:42.667 --> 03:26:43.683
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

03:26:43.683 --> 03:26:45.820
MATT: Any of you had a chance
to have any sort of interaction

03:26:45.820 --> 03:26:47.348
with these things to that battle.

03:26:47.348 --> 03:26:48.831
LAURA: Well, by that point,

03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:53.250
our friends were possessed pretty fast and,

03:26:53.250 --> 03:26:54.820
you know, they were attacking us.

03:26:54.820 --> 03:26:55.850
MATT: Yeah, totally.

03:26:55.850 --> 03:26:59.030
MARISHA: I just want to say, our track record with ghosts

03:26:59.030 --> 03:27:00.940
hasn't been great.

03:27:00.940 --> 03:27:02.130
MATT: That's true.
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:27:02.130 --> 03:27:03.790
LAURA: Well, that's not totally true, Beau,

03:27:03.790 --> 03:27:06.980
because I did read porn to some and they liked it.

03:27:06.980 --> 03:27:08.540
MARISHA: You're-- that is correct.

03:27:08.540 --> 03:27:10.070
TALIESIN: I don't remember that.

03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:11.570
MARISHA: It's rare you find horny ghosts.

03:27:11.570 --> 03:27:12.960
LIAM: How did you forget that?

03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:16.210
LAURA: Oh, I don't think Caduceus was with us at that point.

03:27:16.210 --> 03:27:18.168
TRAVIS: What are we doing next?

03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:20.830
SAM: At dawn we kill Vokodo.

03:27:20.830 --> 03:27:22.797
LAURA: Or do we head back

03:27:22.797 --> 03:27:23.830
to the beach?
MATT: Caduceus was with

03:27:23.830 --> 03:27:25.405
you guys when you did that.
LAURA: What?

03:27:25.405 --> 03:27:26.238
TALIESIN: Oh, I was.
MATT: Caduceus was with you.

03:27:26.238 --> 03:27:28.237
LAURA: Oh, okay, you remember.

03:27:28.237 --> 03:27:30.400
Maybe you were just distracted.

03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:32.510
TALIESIN: I may have just tried not to pay attention.

03:27:32.510 --> 03:27:36.750
TRAVIS: Are we actually weighing
sleeping in a dome out here?

03:27:36.750 --> 03:27:38.110
SAM: There's nothing here to hurt us.

03:27:38.110 --> 03:27:40.167
LIAM: I think maybe on the top floor?

03:27:40.167 --> 03:27:41.860
LAURA: Well, the top floor is very teeny.

03:27:41.860 --> 03:27:43.360
TRAVIS: We don't think that the little specter

03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:44.580
that was in the sarcophagus

03:27:44.580 --> 03:27:47.100
is going to, like, gain power by resting

03:27:47.100 --> 03:27:49.220
and then come up through the floor and (choking)

03:27:49.220 --> 03:27:50.102
in the middle of the night?

03:27:50.102 --> 03:27:51.351
LAURA: It's possible.
MARISHA: That's a good point.

03:27:51.351 --> 03:27:53.510
LIAM: But then back that way are those walking

03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:54.720
bloody tree things.

03:27:54.720 --> 03:27:55.853
TRAVIS: That's true.

03:27:57.040 --> 03:27:57.873
TALIESIN: I say we--

03:27:57.873 --> 03:28:00.060
MARISHA: Do you think we can ally with the bloody trees?

03:28:00.060 --> 03:28:01.750
LIAM: But if we-- Hmm.

03:28:01.750 --> 03:28:03.557
But we could throw the dome up there so that the trees--

03:28:03.557 --> 03:28:04.390
TRAVIS: I mean.

03:28:04.390 --> 03:28:05.530
SAM: If we save that one?

03:28:05.530 --> 03:28:07.590
TRAVIS: Should we talk to the walking talking--

03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:09.500
they lost their minds, though.

03:28:09.500 --> 03:28:11.268
MARISHA: I just want to make it right, guys.

03:28:11.268 --> 03:28:12.243
SAM: No, no, no.

03:28:12.243 --> 03:28:15.725
MARISHA: Okay, I'll find you some allies.

03:28:15.725 --> 03:28:17.110
(laughter)

03:28:17.110 --> 03:28:19.170
ASHLEY: We-- we-- we all

03:28:20.900 --> 03:28:22.810
didn't make the right decisions here, maybe.

03:28:22.810 --> 03:28:24.300
TALIESIN: I made your hands glow.

03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:27.130
LIAM: It's not like you offered to restart a war

03:28:27.130 --> 03:28:28.440
between two nations.

03:28:28.440 --> 03:28:31.032
SAM: That would be...
(laughter)

03:28:31.032 --> 03:28:32.700
That would be crazy!

03:28:32.700 --> 03:28:34.640
Who would do such a thing?

03:28:34.640 --> 03:28:36.975
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Of all the fucking...

03:28:36.975 --> 03:28:39.410
(laughter)

03:28:39.410 --> 03:28:41.520
What?

03:28:41.520 --> 03:28:44.130
You offered <i>what</i>?!

03:28:44.130 --> 03:28:46.380
LAURA: Maybe, you know, it's still light outside.

03:28:46.380 --> 03:28:49.265
We can try making our way back.

03:28:49.265 --> 03:28:51.135
ASHLEY: What time is it?
TRAVIS: ♪ Making our way back. ♪

03:28:52.060 --> 03:28:52.893
MATT: What was that?

03:28:52.893 --> 03:28:54.737
ASHLEY: What time is it?
SAM: Today?

03:28:54.737 --> 03:28:55.628
MATT: At this time--
SAM: We can't fly.

03:28:55.628 --> 03:28:56.831
MATT: -- it's about 3:30, four o'clock in the afternoon.

03:28:56.831 --> 03:28:57.848
TALIESIN: Yeah, so let's

03:28:57.848 --> 03:28:59.200
take time to start making our way

03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:00.690
so there's less to travel tomorrow.

03:29:00.690 --> 03:29:03.160
LAURA: And, honestly, the less spells we have to expend

03:29:03.160 --> 03:29:04.860
getting back to the beach tomorrow,

03:29:04.860 --> 03:29:05.760
the more we can do.

03:29:05.760 --> 03:29:08.110
LIAM: Honestly, we either camp here,

03:29:08.110 --> 03:29:09.990
which we don't need to do,

03:29:09.990 --> 03:29:14.028
or we just try to sneak back several hours on foot

03:29:14.028 --> 03:29:15.970
and park it in the jungle somewhere.

03:29:15.970 --> 03:29:17.073
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, that sounds right.

03:29:17.073 --> 03:29:18.164
TALIESIN: I'm into that.

03:29:18.164 --> 03:29:18.997
LAURA: All right.

03:29:18.997 --> 03:29:21.260
ASHLEY: There's nothing else to see around here?

03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:22.110
LAURA: I think we did it.

03:29:22.110 --> 03:29:23.811
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's it.
LAURA: I think we saw it.

03:29:23.811 --> 03:29:26.184
TALIESIN: They do have a Dole Whip around the corner.

03:29:26.184 --> 03:29:28.269
(laughter)

03:29:28.269 --> 03:29:29.663
LAURA: There's a decrepit
LIAM: (creature hissing)

03:29:29.663 --> 03:29:31.354
Slayer's Cake somewhere around here.

03:29:31.354 --> 03:29:32.530
TRAVIS: Pineapple's good.

03:29:32.530 --> 03:29:35.250
LIAM: That's what would have soothed their spirits.

03:29:35.250 --> 03:29:36.859
The Dole Whip.
TRAVIS: (ghost whisper) Pineapple.

03:29:36.859 --> 03:29:38.500
(laughter)

03:29:38.500 --> 03:29:40.966
MATT: All right.
LAURA: (ghost whisper) I hunger.

03:29:40.966 --> 03:29:43.000
(laughter)

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:44.460
MATT: You gather yourselves

03:29:44.460 --> 03:29:46.150
and begin to make your trek back.

03:29:46.150 --> 03:29:46.983
The same path?

03:29:46.983 --> 03:29:49.410
The direction you were previously traveling?

03:29:49.410 --> 03:29:50.920
LAURA: Yeah, we know that one.

03:29:50.920 --> 03:29:52.045
MATT: Okay.

03:29:53.220 --> 03:29:54.760
A few hours journey, you make your way back

03:29:54.760 --> 03:29:57.870
to the edge of the jungle itself,

03:29:57.870 --> 03:29:59.910
where it begins to rise back up

03:29:59.910 --> 03:30:03.010
in its somewhat diseased state.

03:30:03.010 --> 03:30:05.210
You guys going stealthily from that point?

03:30:05.210 --> 03:30:06.043
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Sure.

03:30:06.043 --> 03:30:07.456
MATT: All right, everyone make a group stealth check

03:30:07.456 --> 03:30:08.731
for me, please.

03:30:09.860 --> 03:30:11.309
MARISHA: No Pass Without a Trace, I'm assuming?

03:30:11.309 --> 03:30:12.375
LAURA: Well, hold on, let me look.

03:30:12.375 --> 03:30:13.208
I might have some left.

03:30:13.208 --> 03:30:14.658
LIAM: You got it?
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace.

03:30:14.658 --> 03:30:16.260
LIAM and TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:30:16.260 --> 03:30:18.180
MATT: All right, round the tables.

03:30:18.180 --> 03:30:20.315
MARISHA: A natural 20. Fuck you, Veth!

03:30:20.315 --> 03:30:22.515
(laughter)

03:30:22.515 --> 03:30:24.130
TALIESIN: Can't even hear you, you're so stealthy.

03:30:24.130 --> 03:30:25.130
SAM: Aggressive stealth.

03:30:25.130 --> 03:30:26.680
MATT: To a total of-- what's the total?

03:30:26.680 --> 03:30:28.547
MARISHA: Oh, 29.

03:30:28.547 --> 03:30:30.053
LIAM: (whispers) Fuck you, Veth!
TALIESIN: 23.

03:30:30.053 --> 03:30:31.753
MATT: 23. Well, plus 10 for--

03:30:31.753 --> 03:30:33.320
TRAVIS: Yasha, come on, come on.

03:30:33.320 --> 03:30:35.053
TALIESIN: Was that plus 10?

03:30:35.053 --> 03:30:36.270
MARISHA: Oh, plus 10, 39.

03:30:36.270 --> 03:30:37.520
MATT: 39, all righty.

03:30:37.520 --> 03:30:38.943
LIAM: Rogue style.

03:30:38.943 --> 03:30:40.550
TALIESIN: 23.
MATT: 23.

03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:41.600
SAM: 39.

03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:42.824
ASHLEY: 18.

03:30:42.824 --> 03:30:44.690
LAURA: Nice, nice.

03:30:44.690 --> 03:30:47.200
MATT: Veth and Beauregard, both equally vanishing

03:30:47.200 --> 03:30:48.160
into another campaign.

03:30:48.160 --> 03:30:50.690
MARISHA: So Veth knew exactly--

03:30:50.690 --> 03:30:52.044
she heard me.

03:30:52.044 --> 03:30:56.053
(laughter)

03:30:56.053 --> 03:30:57.200
MATT: Yasha?

03:30:57.200 --> 03:30:58.316
ASHLEY: 18.

03:30:58.316 --> 03:30:59.730
LIAM: Just through the trees.

03:30:59.730 --> 03:31:00.920
MATT: Exactly.

03:31:00.920 --> 03:31:01.753
Caleb?
LIAM: 15.

03:31:01.753 --> 03:31:02.853
MATT: 15. Okay.

03:31:02.853 --> 03:31:03.686
LAURA: 17.

03:31:03.686 --> 03:31:05.815
MARISHA: I just fart right in her path.
TRAVIS: 27.

03:31:05.815 --> 03:31:06.926
(laughter)

03:31:06.926 --> 03:31:07.875
LIAM: Hold up, there's danger.

03:31:07.875 --> 03:31:08.908
SAM: But she's so stealthy.

03:31:08.908 --> 03:31:10.822
She cups it and throws it back.

03:31:10.822 --> 03:31:12.130
(laughter)

03:31:12.130 --> 03:31:13.430
MATT: Like a hadouken?
MARISHA: Deflect Missiles!

03:31:13.430 --> 03:31:15.513
(laughter)

03:31:16.440 --> 03:31:17.273
MATT: Okay,

03:31:18.230 --> 03:31:21.227
through this stealth fart duel,

03:31:21.227 --> 03:31:23.520
you do manage to quietly make your way

03:31:23.520 --> 03:31:26.110
beyond the boundaries of the dangerous

03:31:26.110 --> 03:31:28.660
animated trees that wander through

03:31:28.660 --> 03:31:30.880
this portion of the diseased forest.

03:31:30.880 --> 03:31:33.680
Eventually making your way deeper into the jungle,

03:31:33.680 --> 03:31:36.460
coming about the time dusk hits

03:31:36.460 --> 03:31:40.192
towards the northern base of the mountain of Rumblecusp.

03:31:41.090 --> 03:31:42.190
You can continue your journey

03:31:42.190 --> 03:31:44.920
or you could bed down here.

03:31:45.790 --> 03:31:46.623
You could,

03:31:46.623 --> 03:31:49.113
if you wanted to, continue and

03:31:50.410 --> 03:31:53.317
get more distance across the mountainside,

03:31:54.170 --> 03:31:55.540
into the evening, you're welcome to,

03:31:55.540 --> 03:31:56.578
or you could stop now.

03:31:56.578 --> 03:31:59.260
SAM: Would we make it all the way back to the boats?

03:31:59.260 --> 03:32:00.583
Probably not, right?

03:32:00.583 --> 03:32:02.110
MATT: You could if you traveled throughout the entire night.

03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:05.390
You could make part of the way there before midnight hits.

03:32:05.390 --> 03:32:07.840
Four hours of travel across the mountain range will get you

03:32:07.840 --> 03:32:08.700
a fair distance.

03:32:08.700 --> 03:32:12.920
LAURA: If we sleep here and we fly in the morning,

03:32:12.920 --> 03:32:14.500
is it going to be just

03:32:14.500 --> 03:32:15.620
an hour of flight?

03:32:15.620 --> 03:32:16.453
MATT: No,

03:32:16.453 --> 03:32:18.850
it would still be two hours from where you are.

03:32:18.850 --> 03:32:20.880
If you continue on for the mountain for a bit,

03:32:20.880 --> 03:32:23.994
you may be able to cut one hour off of that flight.

03:32:23.994 --> 03:32:25.262
MARISHA: Try and do that.
SAM: It seems worth it, s

03:32:25.262 --> 03:32:26.095
Save a spell.

03:32:26.095 --> 03:32:26.928
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:26.928 --> 03:32:28.740
TALIESIN: I still have spells to burn.

03:32:28.740 --> 03:32:30.300
Not a lot of them, but I have a couple.

03:32:30.300 --> 03:32:31.133
LAURA: Okay.

03:32:31.133 --> 03:32:32.320
TRAVIS: And plus, are we going back to

03:32:32.320 --> 03:32:34.000
where the ships are, to the rear entrance?

03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:36.490
Are we going to try and go and turn Terra as well

03:32:36.490 --> 03:32:38.132
and add one to our number?

03:32:38.970 --> 03:32:41.270
Before we fight Vokodo?

03:32:41.270 --> 03:32:43.010
TALIESIN: That's a good point.

03:32:43.010 --> 03:32:44.593
TRAVIS: The hunting leader.

03:32:46.240 --> 03:32:48.468
LAURA: We could try to do that.

03:32:48.468 --> 03:32:50.370
I don't have the ability to do that.

03:32:50.370 --> 03:32:52.672
Do you have any Greater Restoration left?

03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:55.540
MATT: Well, you couldn't get to Vo tonight.

03:32:55.540 --> 03:32:56.880
LAURA: We couldn't get to Vo.

03:32:56.880 --> 03:32:58.920
MATT: Vo is on the opposite side of the mountain from you.

03:32:58.920 --> 03:33:00.687
LAURA: We couldn't get to Vo tonight.

03:33:01.820 --> 03:33:04.277
TALIESIN: I have one left if we had to.

03:33:05.610 --> 03:33:08.123
MARISHA: But not tonight.
TALIESIN: No.

03:33:08.123 --> 03:33:09.348
MARISHA: How many of those

03:33:10.240 --> 03:33:13.367
fancy bowls you got for Heroes' Feast?

03:33:15.350 --> 03:33:18.000
SAM: Could we have Terra meet us?

03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:20.110
LAURA: Meet us at Heaven Falls?
SAM: At Heaven Falls?

03:33:20.110 --> 03:33:23.430
TRAVIS: Ooh, the place where she-- they?

03:33:23.430 --> 03:33:25.420
He, she, I can't remember.

03:33:25.420 --> 03:33:26.253
Firbolg.

03:33:27.550 --> 03:33:28.542
MATT: She.
MARISHA: Terra?

03:33:28.542 --> 03:33:30.990
TRAVIS: She is not supposed to go?

03:33:30.990 --> 03:33:32.420
Would she do that?

03:33:32.420 --> 03:33:34.810
SAM: She could come close, maybe?

03:33:34.810 --> 03:33:37.230
Just to the edge of something.

03:33:37.230 --> 03:33:38.540
LAURA: Vilya could maybe--

03:33:38.540 --> 03:33:40.755
could you snag her?

03:33:40.755 --> 03:33:42.726
And fly her to us?

03:33:45.920 --> 03:33:47.860
MATT: "Terra's is a prickly sort.

03:33:47.860 --> 03:33:51.440
"You'd have to be mighty convincing to get her to break rank

03:33:51.440 --> 03:33:53.400
"from whatever she's in the middle of doing

03:33:53.400 --> 03:33:55.200
"to walk out on a limb towards a place

03:33:55.200 --> 03:34:00.180
"that Vokodo vehemently warns not to go near.

03:34:00.180 --> 03:34:02.770
"It's possible, I'm just saying

03:34:03.660 --> 03:34:04.870
"it's challenging."

03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:07.250
TRAVIS: We might have to lie to her.

03:34:07.250 --> 03:34:09.370
LAURA: Right.
TRAVIS: Send a message saying that.

03:34:09.370 --> 03:34:12.050
LAURA: Hey Terra, Vilya needs your help.

03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:13.780
SAM: No, not Vilya. Viridian, yeah.

03:34:13.780 --> 03:34:16.238
LAURA: Viridian needs your help.

03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:19.333
MATT: "You can try it."

03:34:20.200 --> 03:34:22.600
SAM: And then-- just to game this out--

03:34:22.600 --> 03:34:25.700
would lying to Terra to get her to come

03:34:25.700 --> 03:34:27.100
to a place where she's not supposed to be

03:34:27.100 --> 03:34:28.200
when she gets there, we're like,

03:34:28.200 --> 03:34:31.560
"Haha! We lied! But seriously, we need your help." Right?

03:34:31.560 --> 03:34:33.282
LAURA: No, no, no. We'll--

03:34:33.282 --> 03:34:35.540
Vilya would go up and be like,

03:34:35.540 --> 03:34:36.780
"I'm still Viridian,"

03:34:36.780 --> 03:34:38.910
and then she would shake her hand and be like,

03:34:38.910 --> 03:34:40.480
"I'm so glad you came, I need your help."

03:34:40.480 --> 03:34:42.530
But she would cast Greater Restoration

03:34:42.530 --> 03:34:43.450
when she shook her hand

03:34:43.450 --> 03:34:45.590
and Terra will be totally free of it

03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:46.423
and she will help us.

03:34:46.423 --> 03:34:49.110
TALIESIN: Takes about six seconds for Greater Restoration

03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.943
to take hold.

03:34:49.943 --> 03:34:52.440
And it was one thing to get you to sit still

03:34:52.440 --> 03:34:53.273
I don't know if--

03:34:53.273 --> 03:34:57.650
MATT: "I can't say that I'm a great liar, but I can try?"

03:34:57.650 --> 03:34:59.930
TRAVIS: Is Terra a magic user?

03:34:59.930 --> 03:35:01.320
MATT: "No, not that I know of."

03:35:01.320 --> 03:35:03.904
TRAVIS: Is Terra--
MATT: "Maybe on a small scale."

03:35:03.904 --> 03:35:06.270
TRAVIS: Does she ever move alone as a hunting leader?

03:35:06.270 --> 03:35:08.430
Or does she usually travel with a troop?

03:35:08.430 --> 03:35:10.830
MATT: "She travels with the troop.
Best to survive that way."

03:35:10.830 --> 03:35:12.790
LIAM: And if you are talking about sending a message,

03:35:12.790 --> 03:35:15.920
we need to word that one very carefully so that

03:35:15.920 --> 03:35:17.780
she doesn't come with a whole party.

03:35:17.780 --> 03:35:19.850
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Because we cannot handle that.

03:35:19.850 --> 03:35:20.700
At the moment.

03:35:20.700 --> 03:35:22.050
TRAVIS: Maybe not worth the risk

03:35:23.090 --> 03:35:26.170
just to get one. I dunno how we would get just her.

03:35:26.170 --> 03:35:28.770
LIAM: It's got to be one, otherwise it's

03:35:28.770 --> 03:35:30.637
a negative, not a positive.
TRAVIS: Big problem.

03:35:31.750 --> 03:35:33.810
Well, we get her that we kill all of her friends

03:35:33.810 --> 03:35:34.680
and then we turn her.

03:35:34.680 --> 03:35:36.140
LIAM: There it is.

03:35:36.140 --> 03:35:36.973
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:35:36.973 --> 03:35:38.080
TRAVIS: Kidding.

03:35:38.080 --> 03:35:39.815
MARISHA: Oh, y-yeah.

03:35:41.501 --> 03:35:43.668
(laughter)

03:35:45.640 --> 03:35:48.155
TRAVIS: Maybe not, maybe without Terra, then?

03:35:49.380 --> 03:35:51.760
And if so, are we taking that second entrance

03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:52.930
into Vokodo's lair?

03:35:52.930 --> 03:35:57.930
It's still pulled us towards, I'm assuming, it.

03:35:58.220 --> 03:36:00.333
LAURA: Yeah, but maybe from a different direction.

03:36:00.333 --> 03:36:01.610
TRAVIS: One it wasn't anticipating?

03:36:01.610 --> 03:36:04.410
LAURA: Maybe it'll go above him or something.

03:36:04.410 --> 03:36:06.320
TRAVIS: And it fights in water.

03:36:06.320 --> 03:36:07.310
There's no way to get him out

03:36:07.310 --> 03:36:10.430
unless we can collapse a volcano somehow.

03:36:10.430 --> 03:36:12.870
No one can do that-- you can't do that, can you?

03:36:12.870 --> 03:36:16.780
MATT: "I don't believe I can, my apologies."

03:36:16.780 --> 03:36:19.530
TRAVIS: You can't make the ground shake or anything?

03:36:19.530 --> 03:36:22.786
MATT: "Not to that scale, no."

03:36:22.786 --> 03:36:25.786
TRAVIS: You made a leg out of vines.

03:36:26.670 --> 03:36:28.720
MATT: "Scales up a bit for what you're asking."

03:36:29.940 --> 03:36:31.050
SAM: So no Terra,

03:36:31.050 --> 03:36:33.250
we just go in lean and mean?

03:36:33.250 --> 03:36:34.350
Is that what we're saying?

03:36:34.350 --> 03:36:36.230
LIAM: I think that's right.

03:36:36.230 --> 03:36:39.820
TRAVIS: We could try to coax it out.

03:36:39.820 --> 03:36:41.264
I mean, I did manage to--

03:36:41.264 --> 03:36:43.366
I mean, <i>something</i> managed to piss it off.

03:36:43.366 --> 03:36:45.418
So maybe if we got close.

03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:47.948
I just feel like

03:36:47.948 --> 03:36:49.220
we're slower in the water.

03:36:49.220 --> 03:36:51.370
That's where it is.

03:36:51.370 --> 03:36:54.290
The influence is deeper down there.

03:36:54.290 --> 03:36:58.170
SAM: Its lair might be trapped and protected.

03:36:58.170 --> 03:36:59.828
LIAM: That's its home turf.

03:37:02.320 --> 03:37:05.710
TRAVIS: We could send it a message when we got close, maybe?

03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:07.050
Talk some shit?

03:37:07.050 --> 03:37:09.270
MARISHA: Vilya, do you know any reason why

03:37:09.270 --> 03:37:11.860
Vokodo would have a reason to come out?

03:37:11.860 --> 03:37:14.818
MATT: "I've never, ever seen him emerge from his lair."

03:37:16.690 --> 03:37:18.487
LIAM: Also, when angered

03:37:19.350 --> 03:37:23.688
we've already seen the volcano stoked.

03:37:23.688 --> 03:37:26.355
If it were really angered,

03:37:26.355 --> 03:37:28.440
who knows if that thing would blow or not?

03:37:29.840 --> 03:37:33.520
Is Vo directly beneath, down below?

03:37:33.520 --> 03:37:36.500
MATT: It would be in a path of a full eruption, yes.

03:37:36.500 --> 03:37:39.700
And Vilya responds to that with like,

03:37:39.700 --> 03:37:42.515
"While my life

03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:45.750
"was robbed from me for that time,

03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:47.980
"and these people in this village

03:37:49.090 --> 03:37:49.923
"are not

03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:52.390
"truly my family,

03:37:52.390 --> 03:37:56.300
"I'm still responsible for them to a degree.

03:37:56.300 --> 03:37:58.233
"They're still good people.

03:37:58.233 --> 03:38:00.790
"They're still trying to live and be happy.

03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:02.960
"I would not want to put them

03:38:03.820 --> 03:38:05.550
"in harm's way."

03:38:05.550 --> 03:38:07.210
TRAVIS: Do you think fighting Vokodo

03:38:07.210 --> 03:38:09.550
would activate a volcano that would endanger them

03:38:09.550 --> 03:38:11.850
on the outside if we were fighting underneath?

03:38:13.906 --> 03:38:15.205
MATT: "I don't...

03:38:16.900 --> 03:38:19.840
"not if you were to finish the job."

03:38:19.840 --> 03:38:21.443
TRAVIS: Boy.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:38:21.443 --> 03:38:23.050
I think he's holding the cards.

03:38:23.050 --> 03:38:25.090
I think we have to go to the source.

03:38:25.090 --> 03:38:27.597
Because he's holding the town hostage.

03:38:28.570 --> 03:38:30.340
So flipping him the double birds

03:38:30.340 --> 03:38:32.740
from outside is just going to get people

03:38:32.740 --> 03:38:34.564
burned in magma.

03:38:37.300 --> 03:38:39.970
I think we just need to pick our place to camp

03:38:39.970 --> 03:38:41.860
and prepare ourselves the best we can

03:38:41.860 --> 03:38:44.330
and do what we do best:

03:38:44.330 --> 03:38:45.705
improvise.

03:38:47.307 --> 03:38:49.100
SAM: Okay.

03:38:49.100 --> 03:38:51.047
Just throwing it out there,

03:38:51.047 --> 03:38:53.530
we could go in from both directions.

03:38:53.530 --> 03:38:55.100
TRAVIS: Just thinking that.

03:38:55.100 --> 03:38:56.360
MARISHA: Oh, that's interesting.

03:38:56.360 --> 03:38:58.390
SAM: It would be nice to have more people, of course.

03:38:58.390 --> 03:38:59.223
TRAVIS: It'd be nice to know where

03:38:59.223 --> 03:39:01.010
that second entrance actually goes.

03:39:01.010 --> 03:39:01.843
LAURA: Yeah.

03:39:03.060 --> 03:39:05.440
TRAVIS: And if there are all those weaving tunnels,

03:39:05.440 --> 03:39:06.940
where do those go?

03:39:06.940 --> 03:39:09.390
MARISHA: Yeah, not all of them connect to the main chamber,

03:39:09.390 --> 03:39:10.790
there's no way.

03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:12.130
TRAVIS: There's almost no way to explore it, though,

03:39:12.130 --> 03:39:15.590
without one of us being like, "uhh," and going towards the--

03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:16.873
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:39:18.100 --> 03:39:19.790
TRAVIS: Unless you want to (popping)

03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:21.160
and we're out.

03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:22.630
MARISHA: I'm always ready, yeah.

03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:24.730
TRAVIS: I know that about you.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:39:24.730 --> 03:39:26.046
TALIESIN: We could also

03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:30.010
tie a line just as an early warning

03:39:30.010 --> 03:39:31.910
if someone starts to go.

03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:33.143
TRAVIS: Oh, right.
TALIESIN: Like we've done before.

03:39:33.143 --> 03:39:34.080
TRAVIS: Kind of tethered.

03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:35.800
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:37.510
That's a good idea.

03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:39.270
LIAM: If you were tethered and you were in that state

03:39:39.270 --> 03:39:41.300
you were in, do you think you would cut that rope?

03:39:41.300 --> 03:39:42.300
TALIESIN: I think I'd try.

03:39:42.300 --> 03:39:44.080
If we weren't going the way I wanted to go.

03:39:45.390 --> 03:39:47.090
SAM: We take all of our weapons away.

03:39:48.310 --> 03:39:50.255
TALIESIN: I honestly don't have anything to cut it.

03:39:50.255 --> 03:39:51.505
TRAVIS: This plan.

03:39:52.901 --> 03:39:54.059
We go naked.

03:39:55.238 --> 03:39:57.110
TALIESIN: It would give us an opportunity to see

03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:58.380
that someone was trying to leave, though.

03:39:58.380 --> 03:40:00.300
SAM: Bind all of our hands and teeth

03:40:00.300 --> 03:40:01.950
so we can't cut or bite anything.

03:40:03.520 --> 03:40:05.540
MARISHA: It's weird. I feel like we know so much

03:40:05.540 --> 03:40:07.940
more information about this enemy

03:40:07.940 --> 03:40:09.360
than we normally do.

03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:10.750
And yet

03:40:10.750 --> 03:40:12.740
I still have no idea how to fight it.

03:40:12.740 --> 03:40:14.740
LAURA: We know none of his weaknesses.

03:40:14.740 --> 03:40:16.540
MARISHA: We know he's greedy.

03:40:16.540 --> 03:40:18.470
LIAM: Don't exactly know what he is.

03:40:18.470 --> 03:40:21.360
TALIESIN: We know that if we
shift him into another dimension,

03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:24.193
we could possibly hold them there.

03:40:25.338 --> 03:40:26.970
TRAVIS: He doesn't want to go back.

03:40:26.970 --> 03:40:29.520
He was running from something.

03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:32.160
MARISHA: We know he's greedy and we know he's afraid.

03:40:32.160 --> 03:40:33.650
SAM: We do have a lot of cool stuff.

03:40:33.650 --> 03:40:35.760
So if someone wanted to go through the front door

03:40:35.760 --> 03:40:37.290
with an offering

03:40:37.290 --> 03:40:38.440
that could maybe distract it

03:40:38.440 --> 03:40:40.080
while the others go through the back door.

03:40:40.080 --> 03:40:42.060
TRAVIS: Take my sword.

03:40:42.060 --> 03:40:43.357
TALIESIN: We don't know how long that back door

03:40:43.357 --> 03:40:45.138
is going to take, though.

03:40:45.138 --> 03:40:46.774
SAM: True.

03:40:46.774 --> 03:40:49.010
TALIESIN: Or where it lets out.
SAM: We have means of communication.

03:40:49.010 --> 03:40:50.500
We could send messages to each other

03:40:50.500 --> 03:40:51.500
when we're in place.

03:40:52.740 --> 03:40:55.490
TRAVIS: That back door comes with a charm chance, though.

03:40:55.490 --> 03:40:56.850
That's the fucking--

03:40:56.850 --> 03:40:58.870
MARISHA: I mean, I think it all does.

03:40:58.870 --> 03:41:00.145
LAURA: Yeah.

03:41:01.610 --> 03:41:03.060
And the only person that could probably

03:41:03.060 --> 03:41:04.600
get us through the

03:41:04.600 --> 03:41:06.180
original tunnels

03:41:06.180 --> 03:41:07.850
would be Caleb.

03:41:07.850 --> 03:41:09.870
He's the only one that would remember how

03:41:11.170 --> 03:41:12.440
to navigate.

03:41:12.440 --> 03:41:14.790
TRAVIS: Or Frumpkin, but only to a distance, right?

03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:16.290
To explore those tunnels.

03:41:17.950 --> 03:41:19.720
SAM: You mean the front door tunnels?

03:41:19.720 --> 03:41:20.570
He could draw a map.

03:41:20.570 --> 03:41:22.480
LIAM: Any tunnels--
MARISHA: That's true.

03:41:22.480 --> 03:41:24.160
LIAM: -- Frumpkin could go through, but

03:41:24.160 --> 03:41:28.467
I'm unaware if Vokodo's mojo

03:41:28.467 --> 03:41:31.392
would work on a fey creature.

03:41:31.392 --> 03:41:33.270
MARISHA: Vilya also knows the way.

03:41:33.270 --> 03:41:35.187
A map's not a bad idea.

03:41:38.273 --> 03:41:41.291
LAURA: I just don't think we should split the party.

03:41:41.291 --> 03:41:42.816
MARISHA: It's a risk.

03:41:42.816 --> 03:41:45.070
TRAVIS: It seems weird to be given
a second entrance, though,

03:41:45.070 --> 03:41:46.330
and not utilize it.

03:41:46.330 --> 03:41:48.620
LAURA: Yeah, I think we should just go in the back.

03:41:48.620 --> 03:41:49.590
LIAM: We should.

03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:53.230
We can send my

03:41:53.230 --> 03:41:55.010
cat octopus ahead.

03:41:55.870 --> 03:41:57.620
Just to take a look.

03:41:57.620 --> 03:41:58.453
It might not work,

03:41:58.453 --> 03:42:00.657
but it is definitely worth the effort.

03:42:03.470 --> 03:42:04.303
TALIESIN: By then we'll have--

03:42:04.303 --> 03:42:06.470
LAURA: Are we still walking, or are we camping right now?

03:42:06.470 --> 03:42:08.060
MATT: You guys are deciding whether or not

03:42:08.060 --> 03:42:09.240
you're taking the mountain pass

03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:12.032
or camping here at the base of the volcano.

03:42:12.032 --> 03:42:13.631
MARISHA: Walk and talk. We're walk and talking.

03:42:13.631 --> 03:42:15.147
MATT: Along the journey here, but you're

03:42:15.147 --> 03:42:16.040
deciding that stuff.

03:42:16.040 --> 03:42:18.710
SAM: Just one more question for Viridian. Vilya.

03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:21.780
Has anyone else ever given an offering

03:42:21.780 --> 03:42:24.653
to Vokodo with you from the village?

03:42:26.050 --> 03:42:27.380
MATT: "No, it's primarily just been me.

03:42:27.380 --> 03:42:29.920
"Because the path is too dangerous

03:42:29.920 --> 03:42:33.380
"for me to travel with more than just myself."

03:42:33.380 --> 03:42:35.240
SAM: So Terra doesn't know how to get there,

03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:37.022
no one else knows how to get there.

03:42:37.022 --> 03:42:37.880
MATT: "I mean, Terra might.

03:42:37.880 --> 03:42:39.435
"Terra was here before I was, but--"

03:42:39.435 --> 03:42:42.170
LAURA: How did they do the offerings without you?

03:42:42.170 --> 03:42:44.330
MATT: "They had the previous spiritual guardian

03:42:44.330 --> 03:42:45.790
"that would go ahead and make the offerings

03:42:45.790 --> 03:42:46.623
"before they passed away."

03:42:46.623 --> 03:42:49.750
SAM: Oh, they just died of old age or something?

03:42:49.750 --> 03:42:51.210
MATT: "They had an accident."

03:42:51.210 --> 03:42:54.260
LAURA: What kind of accident?
SAM: What was that? What's that?

03:42:54.260 --> 03:42:58.480
MATT: "They never came back from their trip."

03:42:58.480 --> 03:42:59.580
TRAVIS: Oh, that kind.

03:42:59.580 --> 03:43:01.340
LAURA: Oh, he didn't like the offering.

03:43:01.340 --> 03:43:03.380
MATT: "Well, we found their body

03:43:03.380 --> 03:43:04.450
"during one of my journeys

03:43:04.450 --> 03:43:06.170
"when we were looking for them.

03:43:06.170 --> 03:43:10.710
"And it looks like the island took them.

03:43:10.710 --> 03:43:12.977
"Those vines that I warned you about?"

03:43:17.880 --> 03:43:19.630
MARISHA: It's an interesting point, though.

03:43:21.330 --> 03:43:23.583
Vokodo is comfortable around Vilya.

03:43:24.610 --> 03:43:27.510
SAM: So Vilya could go in the front door with an offering.

03:43:27.510 --> 03:43:28.650
MARISHA: Distract.

03:43:28.650 --> 03:43:29.483
MATT: "I could."

03:43:29.483 --> 03:43:32.090
TRAVIS: Vilya would still be
susceptible to the pull, though.

03:43:32.090 --> 03:43:34.490
LAURA: Well, yeah, but that's fine.

03:43:34.490 --> 03:43:35.681
MATT: "I'm

03:43:37.300 --> 03:43:38.400
"fairly strong of will.

03:43:39.310 --> 03:43:40.585
"It's a gamble.

03:43:42.610 --> 03:43:44.290
"And I could hope to

03:43:44.290 --> 03:43:46.790
"and have probably the history to keep him

03:43:47.970 --> 03:43:50.100
"engaged in conversation.

03:43:50.100 --> 03:43:52.390
"I don't know if I could keep him entirely distracted.

03:43:52.390 --> 03:43:56.110
"He senses, it seems,

03:43:56.110 --> 03:43:58.220
"most anything on this island.

03:43:58.220 --> 03:44:00.230
"Not to mention,

03:44:00.230 --> 03:44:01.312
"well, the eyes."

03:44:02.260 --> 03:44:06.090
TRAVIS: And the pull wears off once you're there, correct?

03:44:06.090 --> 03:44:08.340
MATT: "It seems so, yes."

03:44:08.340 --> 03:44:10.140
LIAM: Do we still have the same feeling

03:44:10.140 --> 03:44:11.490
of being watched right now?

03:44:12.580 --> 03:44:14.730
MATT: As you take a moment to pull back

03:44:14.730 --> 03:44:15.563
and just

03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:19.175
look for that sensation, indeed, yes.

03:44:21.140 --> 03:44:22.420
TRAVIS: Mountain pass?

03:44:22.420 --> 03:44:23.530
TALIESIN: Mountain path.

03:44:23.530 --> 03:44:25.190
LIAM: Sure, I can be down with that.

03:44:25.190 --> 03:44:26.320
TRAVIS: Vilya goes to the front,

03:44:26.320 --> 03:44:28.990
we go to the back after Heroes' Feast?

03:44:28.990 --> 03:44:30.990
SAM: Unless we come up with something better

03:44:30.990 --> 03:44:33.055
over text this week.

03:44:33.055 --> 03:44:35.410
ASHLEY: Wouldn't he sense us?

03:44:35.410 --> 03:44:36.243
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

03:44:36.243 --> 03:44:37.076
ASHLEY: You know, isn't he

03:44:37.076 --> 03:44:39.220
always going to know where we are?

03:44:39.220 --> 03:44:40.503
LAURA: I can try

03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:43.310
asking the Traveler.

03:44:43.310 --> 03:44:46.820
Maybe I can use Divine Intervention the way you did.

03:44:48.090 --> 03:44:49.440
I mean, that's a long shot.

03:44:50.480 --> 03:44:51.730
It's never worked for me.

03:44:53.440 --> 03:44:54.573
ASHLEY: I wonder if the Traveler could--

03:44:54.573 --> 03:44:56.500
SAM: But that's what faith is, right?

03:44:56.500 --> 03:44:57.790
LAURA: Yeah, totally.

03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:59.760
ASHLEY: I wonder if the Traveler could

03:44:59.760 --> 03:45:02.142
put out the volcano so it doesn't

03:45:04.290 --> 03:45:06.300
erupt if it gets bad.

03:45:06.300 --> 03:45:08.450
LAURA: But what if the Traveler could shroud us,

03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:11.772
keep him from being able to see us?

03:45:13.367 --> 03:45:16.370
TALIESIN: It's always worth going for the smaller miracle.

03:45:16.370 --> 03:45:17.203
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:45:17.203 --> 03:45:18.550
LAURA: Does that seem like a smaller one?

03:45:18.550 --> 03:45:19.860
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: I think so.

03:45:19.860 --> 03:45:21.180
TALIESIN: I mean, volcano's a lot.

03:45:21.180 --> 03:45:22.132
ASHLEY: A volcano's a lot.

03:45:22.132 --> 03:45:23.862
MATT: It's an interesting idea.

03:45:26.340 --> 03:45:27.832
Okay, go ahead and roll.

03:45:29.840 --> 03:45:30.800
MARISHA: What is that?

03:45:30.800 --> 03:45:31.840
What was that?

03:45:31.840 --> 03:45:33.390
MATT: This is me--

03:45:33.390 --> 03:45:36.130
TRAVIS: Weighing it?
MATT: Well, no, this is me going,

03:45:36.130 --> 03:45:37.390
given the circumstances,

03:45:37.390 --> 03:45:39.620
given Traveler Con's arrival.

03:45:39.620 --> 03:45:41.203
LAURA: No.
MATT: Given the idea,

03:45:41.203 --> 03:45:44.600
I was going to give advantage on the roll, so you could--

03:45:44.600 --> 03:45:47.730
you don't really have advantage on a percentile die,

03:45:47.730 --> 03:45:49.421
but we're doing it here.

03:45:50.894 --> 03:45:52.060
LIAM: It's a long shot but.

03:45:52.060 --> 03:45:52.990
LAURA: It's a long shot.

03:45:52.990 --> 03:45:54.358
LIAM: Chance is a chance.

03:45:55.543 --> 03:45:56.634
LAURA: No.

03:45:56.634 --> 03:45:59.072
I wonder what it would have been if it hadn't fallen.

03:45:59.072 --> 03:46:01.090
No, okay.

03:46:01.090 --> 03:46:02.732
MATT: Worthy attempt, worthy attempt.

03:46:02.732 --> 03:46:04.610
TALIESIN: Can I see that sword hilt when you get a second?

03:46:04.610 --> 03:46:05.790
LAURA: I have it.

03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:07.340
TALIESIN: I'm just going to run Detect Magic over it

03:46:07.340 --> 03:46:09.240
really quick, just to--

03:46:09.240 --> 03:46:11.890
MATT: Not magic, unfortunately.

03:46:11.890 --> 03:46:14.640
LAURA: Does it have any kind of runes or anything on it?

03:46:14.640 --> 03:46:16.530
MATT: It does have some language.

03:46:16.530 --> 03:46:17.720
LAURA: Infernal?

03:46:17.720 --> 03:46:18.920
MATT: Yeah, actually.

03:46:18.920 --> 03:46:19.980
So you go ahead and look into it

03:46:19.980 --> 03:46:22.030
and it looks like

03:46:22.030 --> 03:46:24.920
this blade was the blade of

03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:26.610
the lord.

03:46:26.610 --> 03:46:29.710
And as part of the

03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:31.410
interring of the body,

03:46:31.410 --> 03:46:33.120
the blade was

03:46:33.120 --> 03:46:36.890
destroyed to gift the power of the blade

03:46:36.890 --> 03:46:37.850
to the spirit.

03:46:37.850 --> 03:46:40.060
LAURA: Oh, that's cool.

03:46:40.060 --> 03:46:41.460
TALIESIN: Did we take the armor, too?

03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:44.430
MATT: No, the armor was left.

03:46:44.430 --> 03:46:45.355
TALIESIN: Darn.

03:46:46.430 --> 03:46:47.870
MARISHA: With that, though, is there--

03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:50.580
we know Vokodo is greedy.

03:46:50.580 --> 03:46:51.528
TALIESIN: I was definitely going to think about

03:46:51.528 --> 03:46:52.644
giving it as a gift.

03:46:53.660 --> 03:46:55.080
MARISHA: Is there something

03:46:55.080 --> 03:46:56.960
any of you magic users can do

03:46:56.960 --> 03:46:58.800
where you can infuse a trap

03:46:58.800 --> 03:47:01.598
onto an item or something?

03:47:01.598 --> 03:47:02.431
LAURA: Ooh!

03:47:03.560 --> 03:47:05.990
TALIESIN: I've never done it before, but--

03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:07.830
LAURA: We do have a thing.

03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:10.100
TALIESIN: Yeah, maybe.

03:47:10.100 --> 03:47:13.016
MARISHA: If that's part of Vilya's offering.
TRAVIS: Caduceus, you can imbue an item

03:47:13.016 --> 03:47:14.482
with, like, sunlight, right so?

03:47:14.482 --> 03:47:16.590
TALIESIN: I can imbue an item with a lot of things.

03:47:16.590 --> 03:47:17.650
LAURA: I can--

03:47:17.650 --> 03:47:19.420
what is it, that ward?

03:47:20.422 --> 03:47:23.770
MATT: Oh, (chuckles). I know what you're talking about.

03:47:23.770 --> 03:47:25.610
SAM: Yeah, the--
MARISHA: Me, are you talking to me?

03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:27.990
MATT: No, I'm talking to

03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.970
Jester.

03:47:28.970 --> 03:47:32.770
SAM: You can put a symbol on something that explodes, right?

03:47:32.770 --> 03:47:35.849
LAURA: Yeah. I can't remember what level it is.

03:47:35.849 --> 03:47:37.160
SAM: It's pretty big.

03:47:37.160 --> 03:47:39.085
LAURA: It's either 5th or 6th.

03:47:39.970 --> 03:47:41.578
MATT: Let me see here.

03:47:43.900 --> 03:47:45.340
MARISHA: That could be our cue.

03:47:45.340 --> 03:47:48.100
If you're able to hand off a couple of grenades to it.

03:47:48.100 --> 03:47:48.933
LAURA: Yeah.

03:47:50.000 --> 03:47:52.600
MARISHA: When we hear the bomb goes off, we go in.

03:47:52.600 --> 03:47:54.504
Finish it off.
LAURA: Cad, what is the fucking--?

03:47:54.504 --> 03:47:55.880
SAM: I think it's called Glyph of Warding?

03:47:55.880 --> 03:47:58.113
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it is.

03:47:59.340 --> 03:48:00.550
Oh, I'm not looking at my--

03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:01.450
MATT: 3rd-level.

03:48:01.450 --> 03:48:02.860
LAURA: It's 3rd-level? That's it?

03:48:02.860 --> 03:48:04.230
MATT: Correct. But at higher levels--

03:48:04.230 --> 03:48:06.450
you can cast it at higher levels to do more damage.

03:48:06.450 --> 03:48:08.240
MARISHA: And you can set when--

03:48:08.240 --> 03:48:10.660
the parameters around which it--

03:48:10.660 --> 03:48:13.060
MATT: Correct. It lasts until dispelled or triggered.

03:48:13.060 --> 03:48:14.180
Because it takes an hour to cast.

03:48:14.180 --> 03:48:16.924
So in theory, you could cast it the night before.

03:48:16.924 --> 03:48:18.007
LIAM: On a good item.

03:48:18.007 --> 03:48:20.080
MATT: Depending on how many 3rd-level slots you have

03:48:20.080 --> 03:48:21.680
on multiple items.

03:48:21.680 --> 03:48:25.660
MARISHA: Hand it over, plant a bunch of grenades on it.

03:48:25.660 --> 03:48:26.860
Trigger it when we're ready.

03:48:26.860 --> 03:48:28.670
TALIESIN: Or any spell.

03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:30.170
3rd-level or lower.

03:48:30.170 --> 03:48:31.213
LAURA: Yeah.

03:48:31.213 --> 03:48:32.279
MATT: Ah, but if you choose an object

03:48:32.279 --> 03:48:33.860
that object must remain in its place.

03:48:33.860 --> 03:48:35.280
If the object is moved more than 10 feet

03:48:35.280 --> 03:48:37.239
from where you cast the spell, the glyph is broken.

03:48:37.239 --> 03:48:38.189
LAURA: Aw.

03:48:39.214 --> 03:48:40.250
MATT: So you have to be real creative

03:48:40.250 --> 03:48:42.265
in how you'd move that item.

03:48:44.310 --> 03:48:45.950
SAM: You put it on an item--

03:48:45.950 --> 03:48:49.468
MARISHA: If it's moved more than 10 feet in this dimension?

03:48:50.450 --> 03:48:51.370
Fuck.

03:48:51.370 --> 03:48:52.801
But then, okay.

03:48:52.801 --> 03:48:54.533
TALIESIN: That will be an experiment for another day.

03:48:54.533 --> 03:48:57.790
SAM: Yeah, it could go in a little pocket dimension.

03:48:57.790 --> 03:48:58.830
Doesn't Caleb have those?

03:48:58.830 --> 03:49:00.540
MARISHA: Pull it up, but then as soon as he grabs it--

03:49:00.540 --> 03:49:03.088
does it trigger once it's moved 10 feet or...?

03:49:03.088 --> 03:49:06.510
MATT: When it's moved 10 feet from
where it is, it's triggered.

03:49:06.510 --> 03:49:08.380
But if you cast the spell, and then were like,

03:49:08.380 --> 03:49:09.990
for say, seal it amber.

03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:11.000
MARISHA: Yeah, put it in amber.

03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:12.480
MATT: Technically, it's not being moved from where--

03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:13.313
MARISHA: Give it to it.

03:49:13.313 --> 03:49:16.850
If it yanks it, then it's going to explode.

03:49:16.850 --> 03:49:18.640
MATT: That's pretty interesting.

03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:22.482
LIAM: Oh, Vokodo, here we present you (thumping)

03:49:22.482 --> 03:49:24.984
these fine gifts to you.
MARISHA: With this platter.

03:49:24.984 --> 03:49:26.656
Here you go.
SAM: And we're just going to back up.

03:49:26.656 --> 03:49:29.918
(laughter)

03:49:29.918 --> 03:49:31.220
LIAM: The only question is,

03:49:31.220 --> 03:49:33.790
is he listening to us right now?

03:49:33.790 --> 03:49:37.540
But it is a fine idea and worth trying all the same.

03:49:37.540 --> 03:49:39.420
MARISHA: Well, that's why we've been calling him Guacamole

03:49:39.420 --> 03:49:41.130
this whole time and he definitely

03:49:41.130 --> 03:49:43.480
doesn't know who we're talking about.

03:49:43.480 --> 03:49:48.090
MATT: Vilya does speak up on this and says,

03:49:48.090 --> 03:49:49.420
"It's interesting.

03:49:49.420 --> 03:49:51.410
"Whenever I visit,

03:49:51.410 --> 03:49:54.790
"he often asks about the goings on within the village

03:49:54.790 --> 03:49:56.410
"and around.

03:49:56.410 --> 03:49:59.770
"So I don't know if he hears what we say.

03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:04.080
"He just knows where we are."

03:50:04.080 --> 03:50:05.880
LAURA: Okay.

03:50:05.880 --> 03:50:08.240
MATT: "That's my assumption based on all the time I've been.

03:50:08.240 --> 03:50:10.780
"Because he has asked questions that, if

03:50:10.780 --> 03:50:13.600
"he were indeed listening in, he would know the answer."

03:50:13.600 --> 03:50:14.580
TALIESIN: Oh!
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

03:50:14.580 --> 03:50:16.280
TALIESIN: Well, we've been scouting--

03:50:16.280 --> 03:50:17.873
LIAM: Super. He has sight.

03:50:17.873 --> 03:50:20.480
TALIESIN: We've been scouting for places to

03:50:20.480 --> 03:50:21.670
have the event.

03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:22.580
LAURA: Obviously.

03:50:22.580 --> 03:50:26.890
TALIESIN: And we've at least found
a sword hilt so far to give.

03:50:26.890 --> 03:50:28.240
LAURA: Yeah.

03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:30.330
SAM: But if he senses where we are,

03:50:30.330 --> 03:50:33.260
then he'll know that we're coming up the back door.

03:50:33.260 --> 03:50:35.320
TALIESIN: Yep.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:50:35.320 --> 03:50:36.153
LAURA: Maybe.

03:50:36.153 --> 03:50:38.757
SAM: Unless you're extremely distracting.

03:50:39.640 --> 03:50:42.900
MATT: "I can't tell you. I don't know."

03:50:42.900 --> 03:50:43.960
SAM: It's worth a shot.

03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:45.930
LIAM: But this is an excellent idea.

03:50:45.930 --> 03:50:49.810
And it might make it worth it to enter the front door now.

03:50:49.810 --> 03:50:51.610
MARISHA: And we just all put a glyph

03:50:51.610 --> 03:50:54.610
or as many glyphs as we can on items?

03:50:54.610 --> 03:50:57.020
LIAM: And we still need to

03:50:57.020 --> 03:51:01.312
think things through and be ready for a head to head battle

03:51:01.312 --> 03:51:02.530
in case this does not work.

03:51:02.530 --> 03:51:04.820
And it very well might not.

03:51:04.820 --> 03:51:07.760
Probably won't, but worth trying.

03:51:07.760 --> 03:51:08.718
TRAVIS: Definitely.
MARISHA: He did say

03:51:08.718 --> 03:51:12.993
that these gifts were good for now.

03:51:12.993 --> 03:51:14.230
That they were initial gifts

03:51:14.230 --> 03:51:18.310
and that he anticipated us returning anyway, so...

03:51:20.110 --> 03:51:21.800
It's not going to seem shifty,

03:51:21.800 --> 03:51:23.630
I wouldn't think, if we come back and

03:51:23.630 --> 03:51:25.030
report our findings and tell him

03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:27.262
where we're going to have Traveler Con.

03:51:29.110 --> 03:51:30.585
With a new offering.

03:51:30.585 --> 03:51:32.550
TALIESIN: It also takes diamond to do it.

03:51:32.550 --> 03:51:33.383
MARISHA: Yikes.

03:51:33.383 --> 03:51:35.360
TALIESIN: Powdered diamond.
MARISHA: Powdered?

03:51:35.360 --> 03:51:37.190
TALIESIN: 200 gold worth.
LAURA: Well, we can do it.

03:51:37.190 --> 03:51:39.100
LIAM: Well, I can powder it if you have it.

03:51:39.100 --> 03:51:40.510
LAURA: I have one.

03:51:40.510 --> 03:51:43.627
TALIESIN: I think I'm a little
nervous about powdering diamond.

03:51:45.720 --> 03:51:47.310
LIAM: How do you mean?

03:51:47.310 --> 03:51:49.430
TALIESIN: Diamond is a

03:51:49.430 --> 03:51:51.400
very useful component for

03:51:51.400 --> 03:51:54.299
if something goes really wrong.

03:51:54.299 --> 03:51:56.082
And we don't have a lot.

03:51:59.828 --> 03:52:02.720
TRAVIS: I think we should take the lesson from today and

03:52:02.720 --> 03:52:04.999
just try and talk to Vokodo.

03:52:04.999 --> 03:52:07.766
(laughter)

03:52:07.766 --> 03:52:09.420
Let's learn from Beau's mistake.

03:52:09.420 --> 03:52:10.740
TALIESIN: I cast Blindness.

03:52:10.740 --> 03:52:14.957
TRAVIS: (yells)
(laughter)

03:52:14.957 --> 03:52:16.141
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

03:52:16.141 --> 03:52:17.810
TRAVIS: No!
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:24.068
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not-- Oh, constitution, that's worse.

03:52:24.068 --> 03:52:25.151
15.

03:52:25.151 --> 03:52:26.262
MATT: You go blind.

03:52:27.373 --> 03:52:29.215
TALIESIN: What did we learn now?

03:52:30.840 --> 03:52:32.270
TRAVIS: I'm fine.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:52:32.270 --> 03:52:34.090
(laughter)

03:52:34.090 --> 03:52:35.400
There's a time and place.

03:52:35.400 --> 03:52:39.205
And at the time for talking, sadly, has definitely passed.

03:52:40.540 --> 03:52:42.158
TRAVIS: You're still talking.

03:52:44.400 --> 03:52:46.598
TALIESIN: Just trying to teach.

03:52:46.598 --> 03:52:48.423
(snaps) There we are.

03:52:48.423 --> 03:52:49.256
MATT: And it fades.

03:52:49.256 --> 03:52:51.790
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

03:52:51.790 --> 03:52:53.790
TALIESIN: Oh, I miss my siblings.

03:52:53.790 --> 03:52:55.794
That's fine.

03:52:55.794 --> 03:52:59.130
LAURA: It doesn't do, like, a crazy ton of damage.

03:52:59.130 --> 03:53:00.680
TALIESIN: No, I think there are better--

03:53:00.680 --> 03:53:04.460
LAURA: Unless you did it at a high
level and then that's wasting a...

03:53:04.460 --> 03:53:05.443
TALIESIN: I'd rather just--

03:53:05.443 --> 03:53:07.093
MATT: Well, depends on if you--

03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:08.840
Depends on if you use a bunch--

03:53:08.840 --> 03:53:10.570
I mean, depending on how many 3rd-level slots you have

03:53:10.570 --> 03:53:11.403
the night before.

03:53:11.403 --> 03:53:14.037
LAURA: Yeah, but it takes a 200--

03:53:14.037 --> 03:53:16.910
a diamond worth 200 gold each time.

03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:21.057
LIAM: What about a good case of Fluffernutter?

03:53:21.057 --> 03:53:24.730
Could we get a nice gilded case or box

03:53:24.730 --> 03:53:27.490
full of powder with a glyph on it?

03:53:27.490 --> 03:53:31.340
LAURA: I mean, I can paint a really beautiful gilded box.

03:53:31.340 --> 03:53:32.800
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Hey!

03:53:32.800 --> 03:53:35.090
LAURA: I can paint a lot of treasure.

03:53:35.090 --> 03:53:37.320
Upon close inspection he would know,

03:53:37.320 --> 03:53:40.590
but it would look like something amazing

03:53:40.590 --> 03:53:41.423
before that.

03:53:41.423 --> 03:53:44.573
LIAM: Maybe there's some powder in the boats?

03:53:45.610 --> 03:53:47.030
TRAVIS: Picked clean, right?

03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:48.010
SAM: Our boat's gone.

03:53:48.010 --> 03:53:49.430
LAURA: Veth has a lot of--

03:53:49.430 --> 03:53:50.600
SAM: But I have two bombs.

03:53:50.600 --> 03:53:53.808
I have a Fluffernutter and I have a depth charge.

03:53:54.930 --> 03:53:57.080
TALIESIN: I don't think they're going to do.

03:53:57.080 --> 03:53:59.060
I think this is going to be a lot of

03:53:59.060 --> 03:54:01.920
magic and a lot-- maybe light.

03:54:01.920 --> 03:54:03.878
Since there's so much shadow.

03:54:04.731 --> 03:54:06.110
I don't know.

03:54:06.110 --> 03:54:07.368
Not fire.

03:54:09.010 --> 03:54:11.280
SAM: But hey, if we're going to deliver an item,

03:54:11.280 --> 03:54:14.990
might as well have it full of black powder.

03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:16.490
Just gives us one more,

03:54:17.380 --> 03:54:18.640
one more

03:54:18.640 --> 03:54:20.701
weapon in the fight, I suppose?

03:54:20.701 --> 03:54:21.734
LAURA: Sure.

03:54:23.630 --> 03:54:25.540
We can work on that when we camp tonight.

03:54:25.540 --> 03:54:28.320
TRAVIS: Yeah, it wasn't nothing
when we used it against the hydra.

03:54:28.320 --> 03:54:29.778
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:54:32.032 --> 03:54:34.026
MARISHA: What do I have?

03:54:34.026 --> 03:54:36.185
LAURA: Are we still walking?
LIAM: Well, all we have to decide now--

03:54:36.185 --> 03:54:38.377
SAM: To be continued.

03:54:38.377 --> 03:54:40.620
MATT: You guys are continuing to discuss

03:54:40.620 --> 03:54:42.760
and plot your plans

03:54:42.760 --> 03:54:45.770
for whatever may come in the morrow.

03:54:45.770 --> 03:54:50.770
You precariously hike alongside the volcano's edge,

03:54:51.260 --> 03:54:54.932
the northeastern and eastern edge

03:54:54.932 --> 03:54:56.870
in the dark of night.

03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:58.920
And we'll pick up there next week.

03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:01.010
LIAM: Scratching their heads as they go.

03:55:01.010 --> 03:55:01.843
TALIESIN: I am ready.

03:55:01.843 --> 03:55:03.600
MATT: Got some interesting plots and plans to do.

03:55:03.600 --> 03:55:05.240
SAM: D&amp;D.
MATT: Yeah.

03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:07.820
SAM: Coming up with all the answers on the fly.

03:55:07.820 --> 03:55:08.780
MATT: Oh yeah.

03:55:08.780 --> 03:55:11.370
All righty, we'll pick up there next week.

03:55:11.370 --> 03:55:13.030
Thank you guys so much for joining us.

03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:15.920
I hope you had fun with this chaos as much as we do.

03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:17.050
We love you very much,

03:55:17.050 --> 03:55:19.120
and is it Thursday yet?

03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:20.286
Good night!

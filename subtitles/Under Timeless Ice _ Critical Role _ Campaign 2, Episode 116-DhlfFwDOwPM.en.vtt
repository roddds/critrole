00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.991
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role

00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:05.780
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.829
ALL: (singing and hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.140
MATT: Just like that.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.515
Before we get into tonight's episode,

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:14.107
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:17.200
beginning with the first of our two sponsors, Cortex.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.580
Sam, if you don't mind.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.160
SAM: This episode is sponsored by Cortex,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
a brand new gaming toolset from our pals at Fandom,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.550
the D&amp;D Beyond folks, that lets you create

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.540
your own original game from hundreds of modular parts

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.830
to best suit your world and play style.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.370
Using dice and descriptive traits, you can craft

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.510
and play in all kinds of genres and worlds

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.750
from books, TV, movies, and video games.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.100
Cortex is designed for episodic one shots

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.460
as well as longer epic story arcs online or in person.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.150
To show you how easy it is, I used Cortex to design

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.610
the most immersive horror game you'll ever experience.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.810
I call it Tax Code Carnage:

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.101
IRS Annihilation,

00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.870
the thrilling and chilling game of adventure and accounting

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.010
as you and your party delve into the darkness

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.620
of the federal tax code and file your returns by April 15th

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.754
before evil audit monsters garnish your soul.

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:11.210
(laughter)

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.930
I'll demonstrate.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.210
Oh, wait, I'm rolling too early.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.874
Oh no!

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:16.707
(laughter)

00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:18.354
Oh no.

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:20.430
I'm making up my own rules of the stupid game

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.256
and I've already broken my own rules.

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:23.581
(laughter)

00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:24.414
Oh no!

00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:27.750
A CPA aboleth is trying to shred my form 1040.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.650
Time to file an extension.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.670
A seven?

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.870
My deductibles weren't itemized,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.670
so much red tape, no problem.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.180
I'll cast a 4th-level fixed asset cash flow spell.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.154
Nat one, I'm insolvent!

00:01:42.154 --> 00:01:44.040
(laughter)

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.740
So my question to you guys is, does it need some more work

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.398
or can Darrington Press publish this, like, right away?

00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:52.820
TRAVIS: I mean, a little more play testing.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.530
LAURA: I think it's great.
ASHLEY: I think it's ready to go.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.900
SAM: Or is it too spooky?

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.820
Is it too scary?

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.197
ASHLEY: It's terrifying, my god.

00:01:59.197 --> 00:02:01.197
LIAM: Great commercial read.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.020
SAM: Anyway, right now Fandom is giving away free copies

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.330
of the main Cortex rule book on Twitter,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
twitter.com/cortexrpg.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.600
So head over for a chance to get a copy

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.150
or simply grab your own digital or physical copy

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.446
right now at bit.ly/cortexrpgcr.

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:18.629
LAURA: Woo!
MARISHA: Ey!

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.996
SAM: Ey!
MARISHA: Ey!

00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:21.850
TRAVIS: Nice job, taxman.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.720
MARISHA: Good game.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.896
LIAM: Physical copy.
SAM: File early!

00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:26.762
(laughter)

00:02:26.762 --> 00:02:28.290
MATT: Awesome. Thank you very much, Sam.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.620
And thank you, Fandom friends and Cortex.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.509
Our second sponsor for tonight is Hocus Pocus the game.

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.503
That is a thing that exists, like the OG,

00:02:39.503 --> 00:02:42.570
awesome Hocus Pocus classic of the era.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.730
In the game, players must match the color of the ingredients

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.510
on the game board to stun the Sanderson sister and stop--

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.952
sisters-- or stop their sinister plot.

00:02:50.952 --> 00:02:51.804
LAURA: There's three of them.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:52.956
MATT: That's what I said!

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:53.900
Well, it's a singular on the page.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.550
TRAVIS: Black flame candle.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.911
MATT: The sisters-- which I knew--

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:58.880
and stop their sinister plot.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.790
The game's packaging is designed to look like a spell book

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.570
to reflect the theme of the original Disney movie.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.780
And it makes a wonderful addition to bookshelves.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.412
We're going to have to get one for ourselves.

00:03:07.412 --> 00:03:08.901
LAURA: I want it!

00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:11.060
MARISHA: I had such a crush on Billy.
MATT: Hell, yeah.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.210
LAURA: Me, too!
MATT: It also includes beautiful artwork faithful

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.760
to the original Disney film, as well

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.710
as high quality components, like
the adorable wooden Binx game piece.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.360
Easy to learn and quick to play for two to six players.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.040
It's perfect for family game night this fall season.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.681
So check it out at

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:29.861
bit.ly/CritRoleHocusPocus

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.760
for more details.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.895
SAM: Can I just say that I watched that movie

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:35.950
for the first time this Halloween season?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.560
MARISHA: Wait, for the first time?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.388
SAM: I had never seen it.

00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:40.606
It's really good.

00:03:40.606 --> 00:03:43.063
Sarah Jessica Parker's so good!

00:03:43.063 --> 00:03:45.706
LAURA: She's so adorable. We were just talking about this.

00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:49.110
She was, like, the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen in my life.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.770
MARISHA: My lucky rat's tail.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.620
She's so good! I love her.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.790
Why didn't we watch that?

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.290
LIAM: With the Looney Tunes humor too she was like--

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.404
MATT: I still think she was better

00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:01.073
in Fight of the Navigator, but anyway.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.200
So we have a few other announcements we have here.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.320
We are excited to announce our next project

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.070
with our friends at Dark Horse Comics,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.296
the Mighty Nein Origins.

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.996
TRAVIS: Let's go, fam! Let's go!
(cheering)

00:04:15.996 --> 00:04:18.350
MATT: It's a series of hard cover graphic novels

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.950
that explores the origin story of each member

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.910
of the Mighty Nein.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.360
The first two volumes that are scheduled

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.320
for release are Jester Lavorre due in June 2021

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.761
and Caleb Widogast in July of 2021.

00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.794
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:33.610
MATT: They're both available for pre-order now

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.780
at your local game shops and other book retailers.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.613
And they're fantastic.

00:04:37.613 --> 00:04:39.590
We can't wait to be able to announce the creative team

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.540
helping put this together.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.140
And to learn more about the creative team I'm talking about,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.333
go check out our announcement article at critrole.com.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.350
Marisha, you got an announcement as well.

00:04:52.723 --> 00:04:53.840
MARISHA: Oh, I do!

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.893
I should really read these before we get started.

00:04:57.893 --> 00:04:59.618
TRAVIS: Professionals!
MARISHA: Oh, man.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.530
Oh, yeah we're back for another episode

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.030
of Narrative Telephone Round Two this Tuesday,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.320
November 17th at 4:00 PM Pacific

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.253
and our storyteller is the one and the only Brian W. Foster.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.750
Buckle up for this one.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.890
LAURA: The cabbage man.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.955
MARISHA: Buckle up, it's special.

00:05:20.955 --> 00:05:22.972
MATT: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: That's a good word.

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:25.283
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: Definitely. Thank you, Marisha.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.810
MARISHA: Don't watch, it's-- I'd say not safe for work.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.140
Not that any of us are at work, but not safe for work.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.210
MATT: Brian definitely kicked us down that alleyway.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.043
Thank you, Marisha.

00:05:36.043 --> 00:05:37.683
Thank you... Brian.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.440
And Laura, you have an announcement.
LAURA: Oh, I do!

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.820
So you guys know our Vox Machina d20 set

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.553
that we released before, but I'm excited to let you know

00:05:48.553 --> 00:05:52.140
that we're doing full sets of dice.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.217
So right now we have available a Vex set,

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:01.330
a Grog set, and a Vax set.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.260
They're in the store. These are the pretty, like,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.170
leather bags that they come in.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.670
They're lined all beautifully.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.730
They're so lovely.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.980
LIAM: They are beautiful.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.050
LAURA: Yeah, I love them.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.930
They're with our friends at Diehard Dice.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.900
So yeah, go check them out.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.050
LIAM: Good looking set of dice.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.555
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
LAURA: No, shut up!

00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:22.330
MATT: Right out of the gate.
TRAVIS: The mug came up.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.705
LAURA: Oh, I got a n-n-nineteen on mine.

00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:25.671
SAM: What the--

00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:28.112
ASHLEY: Oh, I got a natural 20 on the Vax one!

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.743
TRAVIS: These are weighted properly, we swear.

00:06:32.743 --> 00:06:34.795
They're correctly weighted.
LAURA: They're fancy, I love them.

00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:36.990
MATT: You guys better not be using those dice tonight.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.837
They're already rolling way too high.

00:06:38.837 --> 00:06:39.670
TALIESIN: Ooh, it's got a liner.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.240
MATT: All righty, then thank you so much, Laura.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.440
TRAVIS: Why, what happens tonight, Matt?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.048
MATT: Well, let's find out shortly because...

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:49.690
with that I believe we are done with our announcements.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.023
Let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:30.594
(dragon roaring)

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.600
MATT: And welcome back.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.150
So, last we left off:

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.000
the Mighty Nein, making their way north

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.620
into the realm of Eiselcross, hired by Vess DeRogna

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.620
of the Cerberus Assembly to help bring her and protect her

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.197
towards the ruins of Aeor on the region of Foren.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:56.197
Unfortunately, Vess was murdered by,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.830
by the previous ally-- or at least the body

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.230
of the previous ally-- Mollymauk,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.630
traveling with other individuals northward

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.260
on a similar path.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.770
You discovered Vess' dead corpse, covered for it,

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.690
so nobody else would discover it as well,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.180
and made your rapid escape from Balenpost

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.560
along with your scout, Dagen Underthorn,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.010
who has been leading you through the icy frigid realm

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.650
towards the first location on the map

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.720
which you've decided to explore.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.120
Dubbed A5 on the map, it is one of the numerous

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.780
early excavations of fallen Aeorian debris.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.220
And after making your way across some mysterious encounters,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.220
some strange weather and making some allies

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.333
out of possible enemies in the shape of intelligent Yeti,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.630
you discovered the outside of this excavation site.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.750
As you found a number of long frozen bodies left

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.580
in the surrounding debris in ice and stone,

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.810
you begin to approach the entrance to it.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.890
And so picking up where we left off

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.843
as Dagen once more goes,

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.760
"All right so, got ya here.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.210
"That's what I'm being paid for.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.620
"I'll just set up camp out here.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.870
"And if I see anything strange I'll,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.629
"I dunno, shout loudly down the hall for you.

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:23.530
"But stay alive."

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.410
TRAVIS: For sure, but also don't feel like you need

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.040
to just remain outside; if there is trouble

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.400
you'll come in, won't you?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.530
MATT: "Well, yeah, I mean-- but I'm not going to go

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:33.672
"super deep in there.

00:10:33.672 --> 00:10:35.558
"I don't know what kind of dangers are in--

00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:38.640
"to be honest I'm not being paid quite enough for that, so."

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.590
TALIESIN: Fair.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.690
SAM: Do we have any sort of communication rock

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.664
or anything that we can give-- do we--

00:10:45.664 --> 00:10:49.008
we don't have anything like that in this campaign do we?

00:10:49.008 --> 00:10:50.883
TRAVIS: We just pierce his ear for no reason.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.970
Hold still.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.520
LAURA: But I can send him a message.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.315
SAM: Yeah, yeah maybe, maybe like,

00:10:58.315 --> 00:10:59.556
well, I can send him a message

00:10:59.556 --> 00:11:01.888
unless we go farther than 150 feet away.

00:11:01.888 --> 00:11:03.970
LAURA: Which I think you might, yeah.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.120
SAM: All right, well, I'll send you a message

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.760
right before we get 150 feet away.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.503
MATT: "Fair, and if things get real dangerous or,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.230
"I dunno, if you find yourselves being suddenly attacked

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.190
"by a bunch of terrible beasts that are climbing

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.290
"their way to the surface and you're not going to survive,

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.623
"if you could just let me know in advance so I can skedaddle

00:11:23.623 --> 00:11:26.315
"that would be great."
LAURA: I'll try to remember that before I die.

00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:28.060
MATT: "I appreciate it.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.780
"All right then, stay safe.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.180
"See you on the other side."

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.760
SAM: We have a rule in the Mighty Nein.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.980
If we don't come back within seven days,

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.313
you have to hold a funeral for all of us.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.998
MATT: "How elaborate are you thinking?"

00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:44.007
SAM: I mean--

00:11:44.007 --> 00:11:45.048
TALIESIN: Pretty elaborate I feel like.

00:11:45.048 --> 00:11:46.490
SAM: We gave you a thousand gold, right?

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.730
So at least a thousand gold worth of stuff.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.771
MARISHA: For sure you have to--

00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:52.230
MATT: "How about I pay for the funeral

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.930
"out of the extra I was paid when we took this journey.

00:11:56.094 --> 00:11:57.950
"That sound like a plan?"
SAM: That sounds good.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.070
MATT: "Perfect."
LAURA: Yeah.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.500
MATT: "I'm going to go ahead and cook up a meal. Good luck."

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.450
He goes ahead and makes his way away

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.910
from the initial alcove where you guys

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.750
are currently standing at the precipice

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.520
of the entrance to find a safer space

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.610
to set up his small camp out of sight.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.358
TRAVIS: I had See Invisibility up when

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:20.842
Mollymauk or Admin Profile or whoever was talking to Jester.

00:12:20.842 --> 00:12:22.550
That's down now, right?

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.800
It's been, like, an hour plus, right?

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.880
MATT: I'd say it's probably--

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.040
because you guys did begin looking

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.649
through the bodies and stuff and that was--

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:34.070
I'm trying to remember when you did that.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.935
I would say yeah. I'd say it's down by now.

00:12:35.935 --> 00:12:37.018
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.832
LIAM: So... now what?

00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:47.390
TRAVIS: I think we agreed we're going to enter?

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.923
<i>But</i>, be open

00:12:50.923 --> 00:12:55.300
to hearing a story before we kick shit off?

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.133
Yes?

00:12:56.133 --> 00:12:57.950
TALIESIN: I mean, there's no surprise happening here.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.783
LIAM: No.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.740
LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.290
SAM: Is there anything that <i>we</i>
can do to surprise <i>them</i>?

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.464
Like, they'll expect seven

00:13:09.464 --> 00:13:12.164
people walking down a hallway.

00:13:12.164 --> 00:13:15.950
Should we make ourselves look like six or eight?

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.408
Or should three of us hide

00:13:18.408 --> 00:13:19.683
or be invisible?
LAURA: I just have this weird feeling

00:13:19.683 --> 00:13:24.224
because Lucien could see me scrying,

00:13:24.224 --> 00:13:25.691
he can probably see

00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:29.362
if one of us is invisible or, you know,

00:13:29.362 --> 00:13:31.254
if we're disguised or something.

00:13:31.254 --> 00:13:33.690
LIAM: So he can see through our usual bullshit.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.940
TRAVIS: Yeah, I feel like those nine eyes will flare up

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.824
at different moments to activate something.

00:13:38.824 --> 00:13:40.630
Didn't you say when you scrying

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.273
an eye lit up and they turned and could see you?

00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:46.020
LAURA: I can't remember.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.900
Maybe?

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.541
SAM: Yes, but two of--

00:13:50.541 --> 00:13:52.066
two of you can be,

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.030
you know, worms or cockroaches.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.611
They can't-- they can't see through that, right?

00:13:58.611 --> 00:14:01.947
TALIESIN: I think we save our tricks
until we know what we need.

00:14:01.947 --> 00:14:03.950
TRAVIS: Didn't we do that once before and the cockroach

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.525
was a little on the (whistles).

00:14:05.525 --> 00:14:06.900
LAURA: I was a moth. TRAVIS: A moth, yeah.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.716
And you weren't super with it, right?

00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:09.771
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

00:14:09.771 --> 00:14:12.270
TRAVIS: A little easily distracted, maybe not just yet.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.095
SAM: All right.
TRAVIS: I think you ate a curtain.

00:14:14.095 --> 00:14:18.000
ASHLEY: Wait, what did the stone in the arch say?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.632
That had markings? Did we not-- did we figure that out?

00:14:21.632 --> 00:14:23.340
LAURA: What stone?
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't think we looked.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.630
MATT: Ah, so as the entrance to this, you can see

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.270
there once was solid ice that had just sealed it off

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.330
and has since been worked away. You saw signs of

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.210
large chunks of ice and rock being chiseled

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.000
and broken to expose the entrance that leads

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.330
further down beneath the surface.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.590
But it doesn't look like
there were any markings, necessarily,

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.890
or script or writing or glyphs on it.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.920
It's just the sign that this was a space

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.660
that was intentionally dug and excavated

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.667
to delve within.

00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:55.177
ASHLEY: That's what that means. That's what I wrote down.

00:14:55.177 --> 00:14:57.140
It didn't make any sense.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.640
TRAVIS: Translated it says, "days since last accident."

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.555
MATT: I mean, possibly.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.933
So, you make your way in?

00:15:07.933 --> 00:15:09.060
LAURA: I guess so.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.710
LIAM: I think we are just going in and having a discussion.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.660
LAURA: Is it super duper dark?

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.288
MATT: There is no light inside there.

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.879
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:19.310
I'll take out the Star Razor and say "<i>galas-var</i>"

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.040
and it'll put out that 20 foot--

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.020
MATT: As it ignites the air around with bright divine light,

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.530
you can see immediately in the first few steps

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.750
within the entrance, it pincers a little bit

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.550
and it opens up into a smaller chamber

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.080
maybe no more than five feet within the interior.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.400
LAURA: I come up right behind
Fjord and I go: "<i>galas-var</i>!"

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.905
Does it turn it off?

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.970
MATT: No, unfortunately, the wielder has to say the phrase.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:46.845
LAURA: Too bad.
MATT: That is pretty funny.

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.338
TRAVIS: That's very, very clever, though.

00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:49.362
LAURA: I was just trying to see.

00:15:49.362 --> 00:15:52.583
SAM: I'm going to just power up a bolt

00:15:52.583 --> 00:15:57.563
with a spell. I'll Voltaic Bolt a spell-- a bolt.

00:15:57.563 --> 00:16:00.000
Just so it's ready to go.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.500
MATT: Okay, how long does it last?

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.363
SAM: It just says until I use it.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.110
MATT: Should be concentration.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.370
SAM: Oh, you're totally right.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.666
I don't do that.

00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:12.394
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh)

00:16:12.394 --> 00:16:14.310
MARISHA: And how many sets of footprints do we see

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.540
going into the cave?

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.610
MATT: A number of sets.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.340
There are fresher ones you can see,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.629
but there are older ones that come in and out so

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:23.060
you know a lot of people have been through here

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.210
and who knows how many sets have been wiped out

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.450
by the weather and then been left behind in recent times.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.740
It's a smattering, but there you do see a number

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.440
of sets that are at least within the last a day or so.

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.879
MARISHA: All right.

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:44.028
SAM: Do you want me to scout ahead and check for things?

00:16:44.028 --> 00:16:45.975
Trappies and stuff?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:47.928
MATT: And the marching order would be preferred.

00:16:47.928 --> 00:16:49.777
SAM: I guess I'll go first.
MATT: Okay.

00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:52.592
MATT: Veth up first.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.220
TRAVIS: Walk in the park.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.610
MATT: Who else is coming up after Veth?

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.170
TRAVIS: Nobody for at least a hundred feet.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.270
MATT: Okay, so.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.007
(laughter)
LAURA: I'll follow Veth.

00:17:03.007 --> 00:17:06.643
LIAM: If you're going to message Dagen, now's the time.

00:17:06.643 --> 00:17:09.350
SAM: Dagen, we're 150 feet away from you.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.890
(laughter)

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.045
MATT: All right, so.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.000
You, go ahead and roll a stealth check

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.350
as you enter into darkness.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:20.920
Do you have darkvision?

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.013
SAM: I do. My stealth is 25.

00:17:25.013 --> 00:17:26.254
MATT: Okay.

00:17:27.971 --> 00:17:30.320
Halflings have darkvision?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.205
SAM: Who ha?

00:17:31.205 --> 00:17:33.731
MATT: Halflings have darkvision?
SAM: Uh--

00:17:33.731 --> 00:17:36.906
LAURA: Ooh, that's goblin.

00:17:36.906 --> 00:17:37.960
SAM: Let's see here.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.730
Racial traits, is that where it would be?

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.510
MATT: Yep.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.350
SAM: It doesn't say it in racial traits.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.590
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.770
SAM: Do I not have darkvision?

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.319
TRAVIS: I think you did.
MARISHA: I think that goblins did.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.719
MATT: Not as a halfling.

00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:52.043
SAM: Whoa!

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:56.072
I didn't know they made characters
that didn't have darkvision.

00:17:56.072 --> 00:17:57.797
(laughter)

00:17:57.797 --> 00:17:59.730
But seriously, don't all the characters

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.360
have darkvision except for humans?

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.220
MARISHA: All but two.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.570
MATT: A lot of-- a number of them do, yes.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.200
And even darkvision, you still can see in pitch darkness,

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.100
but it's considered very, very low light.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.992
And it's still very limited, so.

00:18:14.197 --> 00:18:15.305
SAM: I can't see shit!

00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:17.555
(laughter)

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.390
MARISHA: Do you want to borrow my goggles?

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.030
SAM: Sure, do I have to attune to them?

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.769
MARISHA: I don't... think... so.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.035
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:18:25.035 --> 00:18:26.387
What <i>do</i> we know?

00:18:26.387 --> 00:18:27.512
(laughter)

00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:30.260
TALIESIN: How does darkvision even work?

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.777
MATT: About 30 feet away on the precipice
of an ice cliff Dagen's going,

00:18:34.777 --> 00:18:36.776
"My god."

00:18:36.776 --> 00:18:39.410
MARISHA: It's been a while since this has been relevant.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.553
MATT: "Well, glad I got some pay up front."

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:42.844
LIAM: You guys got something on your mind?

00:18:42.844 --> 00:18:45.119
MARISHA: It's not. It's not.

00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:46.110
SAM: It's not? I can wear them?

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.024
MARISHA: Yeah, you can just put them on.
They're just night vision goggles.

00:18:48.024 --> 00:18:50.123
SAM: All right, gimme.
MARISHA: Yeah, but I want them back.

00:18:50.123 --> 00:18:51.693
But I want them back?

00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:55.040
But I want them back.
SAM: Oh, this is weird.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.200
MARISHA: Will you, will you acknowledge
that you're going to give them back?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.600
SAM: Yep, yeah, I got it.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.660
MARISHA: They don't make you-- look straight,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.385
They don't make you cross eyed.
SAM: I am looking straight.

00:19:03.385 --> 00:19:05.034
TRAVIS: That's the wall Veth, that's the wall.

00:19:05.034 --> 00:19:06.709
SAM: This is how I do it.

00:19:06.709 --> 00:19:07.952
All right, let's go.

00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:09.854
MATT: Roll a stealth check.
MARISHA: You might need to go see an optometrist.

00:19:09.854 --> 00:19:14.240
LAURA: I'm going to Blessing of the Trickster him-- her.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.923
MATT: Okay, you got it.
TALIESIN: Oh, my god what the hell?

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:17.110
SAM: That is a dainty ring.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.390
TALIESIN: It is, and it should be off.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.531
LAURA: What is happening right now?

00:19:21.531 --> 00:19:23.260
(laughter)

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.897
TRAVIS: Molly!

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.807
MARISHA: Pure chaos.

00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:27.845
MATT: All right Blessing of the Trickster

00:19:27.845 --> 00:19:30.195
means you have advantage on your stealth check,

00:19:30.195 --> 00:19:31.345
which you would have already.

00:19:31.345 --> 00:19:32.603
But now you're blessed by the Trickster,

00:19:32.603 --> 00:19:33.869
so there you go.
LAURA: Oh, wow nevermind.

00:19:33.869 --> 00:19:35.080
SAM: So roll again?

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.163
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Okay.

00:19:37.207 --> 00:19:38.373
MATT: Sure.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.005
SAM: Slightly better than before, 29.

00:19:43.005 --> 00:19:44.463
MATT: 29, okay.

00:19:44.463 --> 00:19:47.060
So as you vanish into shadow,

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.180
all of you wait for a moment.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.205
You make your way inside where
it begins to open up slightly.

00:19:52.205 --> 00:19:53.288
It kind of--

00:19:54.355 --> 00:19:57.355
you enter a sort of kidney-shaped

00:19:57.355 --> 00:20:02.355
slightly curved antechamber of natural rock and ice.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.810
It's about 15 feet wide maybe 25, 30 feet long

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.090
and-- make a perception check for me.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.790
SAM: Well, those are my specialty.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.660
Twelve.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.826
MATT: Twelve.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.870
What you do see within this room,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.950
are signs of an abandoned encampment.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:30.917
Small, but you can see there is an old frayed rope

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:32.530
that is partially coiled in the ground

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.540
and discarded at the side.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.400
You see heavy tools that have been--

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.840
like pickaxes and elements that are used

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.853
for simple excavation.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.215
You see a pile of rags and burlap, sacks and stuff.

00:20:47.215 --> 00:20:50.720
Two different black soot-marked fire pits in here

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.720
that currently are just in disuse.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.260
But it looks like this was a resting place

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.900
or a temporary encampment or a rotating encampment

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.940
for those who are coming to excavate this location.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.531
And then the chamber continues on.

00:21:06.448 --> 00:21:07.950
You can see it goes deeper and deeper and

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.110
becomes a steady decline into darkness below.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:15.110
And it pincers into about a wide enough space for

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.163
single file travel.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.310
SAM: And everyone else is like 30 feet behind me?

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.150
MATT: Yeah, they're still at the entrance.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.580
So they're about 20, 30 feet.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.880
SAM: Let me just go and look and see how--

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.838
if those fire pits or whatever

00:21:29.838 --> 00:21:31.563
are recently used.

00:21:31.563 --> 00:21:33.733
MATT: All right, make an investigation check for me.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.480
SAM: 23.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.243
MATT: 23, looking at the fire pits,

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.090
one of them looks like it hasn't been used in a while.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:47.690
One of them looks like the recent ash and soot in there

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.765
puts it somewhere neighborhood for the past week or so.

00:21:50.765 --> 00:21:52.100
It could be a day ago.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.470
It could be a few days ago, but it's relatively recent.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.090
SAM: Okay, I'll take some soot from there

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:01.097
and just do this, get ready for battle, you know?

00:22:01.097 --> 00:22:02.114
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.050
SAM: And I'll just message back to the friends.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.730
Okay, first room's clear, nothing here.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.980
I'm going to keep going down, but come,

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.170
come up and then I'll go down.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.328
I don't know how to-- go!

00:22:15.328 --> 00:22:17.211
(laughter)

00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:20.060
TRAVIS: What was that?

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.590
Of all the movies you've seen, did you ever see?

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.310
That was like do re mi shit in choir.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.526
SAM: Okay, let's go.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.114
That's what the SWAT teams do.

00:22:32.114 --> 00:22:35.460
MARISHA: That was the cutest thing I've ever seen.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.416
TRAVIS: OSD is no longer going to take our support.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.567
TRAVIS: Stop, ♪ la. ♪

00:22:43.616 --> 00:22:45.543
SAM: Serpentine, serpentine.
TRAVIS: ♪ Ti, do. ♪

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.920
SAM: All right, I'll continue down.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.410
MATT: Okay, you all still staying outside?

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.330
LAURA: No, we're following 30 feet behind.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.170
MATT: Okay, so you follow in after Veth

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.850
and you, too, see this small encampment here

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.570
with the scattered elements and piles

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.607
of disused tools and rags and things

00:23:05.607 --> 00:23:08.170
that lead you to believe that people stayed here

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.030
at some point.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.130
And the tunnel continues on beyond that in a very thin,

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.170
maybe six foot tall, two and a half foot wide opening

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.950
that itself looks partially broken into the ice and rock.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.850
Like, it may be at once point-- at one point itself

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.933
was just sealed, solid ice.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.470
MARISHA: Can I check to see if there's
any markings on the walls?

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.843
Any codes, anything utilizing my cant?

00:23:34.843 --> 00:23:37.740
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: My thieves' cant background?

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.916
Perception?

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.035
No, not good, eight.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.040
MATT: Eight?

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.952
MARISHA: That wouldn't be an investigation?

00:23:49.952 --> 00:23:54.950
MATT: Well, either way, either way

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.550
you don't see any markings, you don't see any writing,

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.540
you don't see any symbols.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.190
It looks like this is just simple bare rock and ice.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.620
MARISHA: Okay, so nothing directing miners

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.130
or anything like that, or any of excavation--
MATT: No.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.615
LIAM: Miners or minors?

00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:11.967
MARISHA: That's-- miners.
TRAVIS: One second.

00:24:11.967 --> 00:24:13.740
TALIESIN: Minor miners.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.890
Minor minor miners.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.450
TRAVIS: Can I go up and just put hands on the wall?

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.247
Just drag fingers across it

00:24:19.247 --> 00:24:21.560
and just make sure it's actually real?

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.220
MATT: Yeah, so you work around one side

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.510
and drag your fingers through and as it does,

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.060
you hear the grinding of ice crystals

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.410
and then, occasionally, the slick elements of smoother ice,

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.120
stone. It's all solid, cold to the fingertips,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.740
but thankfully you have gloves.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.052
LIAM: Before Veth takes off, I apparate Frumpkin

00:24:41.052 --> 00:24:45.330
and scooch Frumpkin into the hood of your cloak

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.400
so that he crawls in a bit like a mink stole.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.710
SAM: It's warm.
LAURA: Like Sprinkle.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.322
LIAM: Yeah, a little weightier.

00:24:52.322 --> 00:24:54.047
A little more healthy.

00:24:54.047 --> 00:24:54.880
MATT: Okay.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.640
ASHLEY: Can I check the fire pit that has been used

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.880
to see if there's anything in there other than,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.053
you know, ash?

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.260
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.090
SAM: Some old insects you can eat?

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.310
LAURA: Guidance.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.700
LIAM: Ooh, just in time.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.740
LAURA: You get an extra d4.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.573
ASHLEY: I do?

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.140
ASHLEY: This would be-- ooh.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:15.973
Okay,

00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:20.800
what's my investigation?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.660
15.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.660
MATT: 15. You see within the ashes that remain here,

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.090
some of it's wood-based burnt carbon,

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.950
some of it is melted fats.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.590
It looks like with a lack of nearby timber,

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.670
you know, the abundance of timber is

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:41.503
not available here.

00:25:41.503 --> 00:25:43.930
So you would-- you see, there
are various different materials

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.640
that were used to start and maintain a fire.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.910
That's what you acquire from that.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.340
Beauregard because you have a super high

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.250
passive investigation, you also glance over

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.050
while she's looking at the fire pit.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.310
The pile of rags and burlap that rests off to the side,

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.130
you can see some of it looks like long discarded

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.893
bedroll elements.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.751
And you see the edge of a boot under it.

00:26:12.841 --> 00:26:14.358
TRAVIS: They left their shoes here.

00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:16.616
MARISHA: (laughing) Does this--

00:26:16.616 --> 00:26:19.482
take your shoes off before we go any further.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.630
Does this look shaped, you know,

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.589
like there's a body that goes with that boot?

00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:29.823
MATT: It's a large enough pile where
a body could fit under it, but...

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:36.310
MARISHA: All right. I'm just going to look at it fast and go

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.228
towards the pile of clothes.

00:26:40.228 --> 00:26:41.603
SAM: You mean you're going or do you want me to?

00:26:41.603 --> 00:26:43.390
MARISHA: I don't know. I'm just following.
SAM: I'm going!

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.565
MARISHA: I don't know your language.
SAM: I'm going to go there, too.

00:26:45.565 --> 00:26:48.398
(laughter)

00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:49.540
MARISHA: And then we go.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.661
But before I pull anything off, can I

00:26:53.661 --> 00:26:54.820
poke with my staff?

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.860
MATT: Sure. You poke the boot and the boot shifts

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.693
when you poke it.

00:26:58.693 --> 00:27:00.870
MARISHA: Did you see that, did you see
that, did you fucking see that?

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:01.980
MATT: Not on its own.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.070
MARISHA: Oh.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.585
MATT: But when you push it, you push it.

00:27:06.578 --> 00:27:07.570
It gives.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.592
MARISHA: I'm going to poke the--

00:27:11.592 --> 00:27:12.590
SAM: The bear.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.970
MARISHA: The bear. I want to poke the mound.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.557
MATT: Okay.

00:27:15.557 --> 00:27:18.050
(low impact sounds)

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:18.883
No reaction.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.240
TRAVIS: Uncover that shit.
LAURA: Just look and see what it is.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.515
MARISHA: You think he's dead?

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.052
TRAVIS: Is that another military hand sign for...?

00:27:30.052 --> 00:27:33.190
SAM: Yeah. Two. Body.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.513
LIAM: Doggy paddle, doggy paddle.
SAM: Doggy paddle.

00:27:35.513 --> 00:27:38.872
(laughter)

00:27:38.872 --> 00:27:41.970
TRAVIS: General sense of tension here.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.080
MATT: Pulling back the scattered elements

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.810
of forgotten and tossed aside material, you uncover

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.368
indeed a frozen corpse.

00:27:52.368 --> 00:27:54.280
MARISHA: Oh, it's frozen.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.620
MATT: It appears to be a rather tough-looking drow

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.520
in heavy leather armor.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.900
His face aghast in terror with trails of frozen blood

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.463
against his face, heading from his eyes,

00:28:06.463 --> 00:28:08.820
his ears, his nose, his mouth.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.870
SAM: Do we recognize him?

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.420
MATT: You do not recognize this individual specifically, no.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.770
TRAVIS: Dynasty-type attire?

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.420
MATT: Indeed. The blade by his
side and the armor he's wearing

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.700
does bear distinctly Kryn dynasty design.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.690
LAURA: Can I do a medicine check to see if-- I mean,

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.440
obviously, this has to be within the last--

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.870
if it's in the last week or if maybe this is much older?

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.415
MATT: Make a medicine check for me.

00:28:36.203 --> 00:28:40.040
LAURA: Guide-- oh, I didn't say it beforehand. Gui-- 24.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.490
MATT: Twenty four?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.820
MATT: Yes, in fact, this body, the elements of it

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.510
that are currently cold are beginning to freeze over,

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.782
let you know that this was probably
within the past few days.

00:28:50.782 --> 00:28:54.260
MARISHA: Oh, can I inspect the body?

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.810
Any special markings?

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.900
Any eyeball tattoos?

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.998
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.
SAM: Eyeball tattoos?

00:28:59.998 --> 00:29:02.440
LIAM: I'm going to kneel down next to her with small flames

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.766
in each hand and bring it close enough to start--

00:29:05.766 --> 00:29:07.860
MATT: Thawing?
LAURA: Guidance!

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.730
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.140
This is an investigation check, you said?

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.450
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.610
Okay, 18.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.113
MATT: 18. So looking at the--

00:29:18.327 --> 00:29:20.290
there are no distinct wounds on the body.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.590
Between both of your checks,

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.000
it looks like the trauma was internal.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.930
And the wounds, or at least the pattern of bleeding

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.760
is identical to how you found Vess DeRogna,

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.180
but you do not see any, eye-like markings on the body.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.170
Nothing akin to what you found on hers.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.200
LAURA: When we-- I can't remember when we were in

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.730
the chamber with Avocado and we got the vision,

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.030
did our ears bleed?

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.450
Did our nose bleed with that?

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.270
Or like, or was it just a bad vision?

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.110
MATT: It was just a bad vision.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.943
LAURA: Okay.

00:29:54.117 --> 00:29:58.070
TRAVIS: The sword next to his body, plain-looking?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.494
I mean, not plain. It's obviously a Kryn sword.

00:30:00.494 --> 00:30:02.110
MATT: I mean, it's well made, you know.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.050
TRAVIS: I'll take it and I'll put it in the Bag of Holding.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:04.883
MATT: Okay.

00:30:04.883 --> 00:30:07.900
MARISHA: Searching through his clothes, pockets any notes?

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.680
Any messages, any ordinances?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.780
MATT: The blade left behind remains,

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.320
everything else on the body has been taken.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.308
MARISHA: Okay.

00:30:16.308 --> 00:30:17.603
LAURA: Can we talk to it?

00:30:17.603 --> 00:30:18.761
TALIESIN: I don't have that today.

00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:21.038
I didn't think it would--

00:30:21.038 --> 00:30:22.310
I thought we would have trouble today.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.653
So I packed for trouble.

00:30:25.653 --> 00:30:26.653
LAURA: That's totally fine.

00:30:26.653 --> 00:30:27.870
Should we take his head?

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.728
TALIESIN: I mean, it couldn't hurt.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.300
LIAM: Pull that back out, please.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.190
TRAVIS: The sword?
LIAM: Yeah.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.193
LAURA: Take out my axe.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.840
Is this fucked up?

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.673
TALIESIN: No.

00:30:38.673 --> 00:30:39.593
TRAVIS: What are you doing, what are you doing?!

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.900
MATT: You watch as Jester cleaves the head

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.950
from the drow corpse.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.990
It rolls about three or four feet before coming to rest

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.823
at your feet.

00:30:47.823 --> 00:30:49.027
TRAVIS: Why did you do that?

00:30:49.027 --> 00:30:49.990
SAM: Is this a thing that we do now?

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.029
We desecrate the body?

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:54.530
LAURA: No, it's just so Caduceus can talk to him later!

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.260
TRAVIS: Oh, just clue us in first.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.093
TALIESIN: Well, we were talking,

00:30:58.093 --> 00:30:59.693
I assumed everyone was listening.
TRAVIS: I thought you snapped

00:30:59.693 --> 00:31:01.718
and we were going to have to turn on you now.

00:31:01.718 --> 00:31:03.130
TALIESIN: Hold on.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.120
Casting Decompose on everything but the head,

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.040
just to get it going.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.482
Whatever the hell is going to grow out here.

00:31:08.482 --> 00:31:09.373
MATT: Okay.

00:31:09.373 --> 00:31:10.908
TRAVIS: Caleb, do something with this sword.

00:31:10.908 --> 00:31:12.010
What did you want?

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.420
LIAM: Well, he's holding two flames and I shake one out

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.930
and then I cast Detect Magic on the sword.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.785
MATT: Okay, the sword itself is inert.

00:31:19.785 --> 00:31:20.800
It is a mundane weapon.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.853
It is well-made, but it is a normal weapon.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:27.810
TALIESIN: That does the full radius, though, to the--

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.643
MATT: Correct.

00:31:28.643 --> 00:31:29.860
TALIESIN: Anything else around that's glowing?

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.870
MATT: Nothing else that catches your attention.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.510
TRAVIS: What about the head that's on my toe?

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.730
MATT: Not magical, but a little ghastly.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:37.563
TALIESIN: It's frozen, it'll keep.

00:31:37.563 --> 00:31:40.383
LAURA: Just take it and put it in the bag or something.

00:31:40.383 --> 00:31:42.470
TRAVIS: Don't we have a bag of colding?

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.530
LAURA: No, that was another person.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.180
LIAM: <i>Ja, ja ja</i>.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.910
TRAVIS: You do?
LIAM: Well, this.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.660
TRAVIS: Oh, it's okay.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.493
SAM: Wait, what is that?

00:31:50.493 --> 00:31:52.200
That's not the thing that shattered?

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.033
That's a new thing?`

00:31:53.033 --> 00:31:53.980
LIAM: It's a new piece.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.266
LAURA: You can put multiple bodies in it?

00:31:56.266 --> 00:31:57.135
TRAVIS: Takes a minute, doesn't it?

00:31:57.135 --> 00:31:59.223
LAURA: I mean, it can just be the corpse holder, you know?

00:31:59.223 --> 00:32:00.783
TRAVIS: I just toss him the head.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.730
LIAM: I put the flames out.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.800
TALIESIN: No, no, no, we need that.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.783
LIAM: Not in time.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.901
After catching it.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.690
Okay, I need a moment.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.410
So I need 10 minutes to put this on ice.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.910
(like Mr. Freeze) Ice, everybody freeze.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.960
I'll put down--

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.818
SAM: I'll go scout ahead while you take your 10 minutes.

00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:26.403
So, you know.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.610
TALIESIN: I'm going to, before you head off

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:33.090
I'm just going to really quickly give you some Resistance

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.160
just in case, tap.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.320
SAM: Oh, thank you.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.300
TALIESIN: Tap Resistance.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.860
SAM: I'm tapped.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.810
MATT: Okay, so you go to scout ahead.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.643
Roll a stealth check for me.

00:32:42.643 --> 00:32:45.350
LAURA: You've still got, for an hour.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.770
SAM: I always have advantage.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.980
LAURA: I know, but now you've got an extra, extra.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.090
Nevermind, I cast Guidance as concentration,

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.590
doesn't matter anyway.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.810
SAM: 30.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.927
MATT: Okay, so you continue on ahead.

00:32:55.927 --> 00:32:57.035
LIAM: 20 minutes.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.630
MATT: You do see

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:06.120
through this space, there's a shift in the ice patterns

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.593
as the tunnel gets smaller and smaller.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.860
The ice seems to take on strange shapes around you.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.310
The hanging icicles bending at odd angles,

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:19.630
and it almost appears organic at a flash from time to time

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.430
giving you the faint sensation like you're stepping

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.900
deeper and deeper into some massive creature's gullet.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.840
It makes you feel a little anxious and nervous.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.120
And as the tunnel tightens and tightens,

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.880
you reach that point rather rapidly where

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.163
only one person at a time could pass through.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.880
You curve around and follow it down at the steady decline.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.420
At some points, it's slippery and you have to

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.370
put your hands up to keep yourself going

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.800
and not begin to slide downward.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.210
The slick ice here will continue to be an issue

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.853
depending on the steepness of the area ahead of you.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.430
But as you continue forward and forward down

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:59.380
for a good hundred or so feet,

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.240
it comes to a wall.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.522
It ends at just a stone wall--
SAM: A sheer wall?

00:34:04.522 --> 00:34:07.530
MATT: A sheer wall, where you can see there is a crack

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.150
at the base of it, a little bit to the left.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.890
There is a a large, heavy crack in the stone

00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:14.750
that heads from floor to ceiling

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.100
and where it meets the edge corner

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.710
of that stone wall to the floor.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.530
There was an opening where a person

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.300
could probably squeeze through

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.300
SAM: Oh, it's that big.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.900
MATT: Squeeze through very uncomfortably.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.270
We're talking, like,

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.950
like The Descent, you know.

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:32.880
Having to squeeze through.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.463
And you don't quite know how far in it goes.
TRAVIS: Underground, too?

00:34:35.463 --> 00:34:37.188
(unhappy) Mm-mm.
MATT: Yeah.

00:34:38.296 --> 00:34:41.160
SAM: I scritch Frumpkin and say:

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.750
Wow, this would be a good job for you,

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.023
but I can't command you, so.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.033
I guess, go!

00:34:52.418 --> 00:34:54.935
MATT: (hissing)

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.450
SAM: Shoo, go, go in the hole.
MATT: (unhappy cat chittering)

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.870
SAM: Go in the hole, go!

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.166
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

00:35:04.166 --> 00:35:06.505
LIAM: (yowling)

00:35:06.505 --> 00:35:07.338
SAM: Eight.

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:08.325
MATT: Eight?

00:35:08.325 --> 00:35:10.500
Frumpkin runs through your legs and heads back

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.750
to the rest of the group.

00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:16.192
(chittering snarls)

00:35:16.192 --> 00:35:17.901
SAM: All right, all right.
LIAM: (yowling)

00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:19.860
MARISHA: I think Frumpkin has rabies.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.223
(laughter)

00:35:22.223 --> 00:35:23.406
LAURA: (drawn-out yowling)

00:35:23.406 --> 00:35:26.180
SAM: I'll peek through the crack

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.790
and see if I can see anything.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.170
First, I'll check it for traps.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.861
I'll check that crack for traps.
MATT: Got it.

00:35:31.861 --> 00:35:33.677
ASHLEY: Oh, long Johnson.

00:35:33.677 --> 00:35:36.037
(laughter)

00:35:36.037 --> 00:35:38.695
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh don piano.

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:41.940
SAM: 23 for traps.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.115
MATT: Why my eyes-- yeah. Sorry.

00:35:45.992 --> 00:35:47.450
MARISHA: Oh, internet.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.120
MATT: Oh, classic internet.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.290
All right, but now Frumpkin is waiting.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:54.990
Didn't go completely back, but is now just waiting

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.740
at the edge and letting you do your thing.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.410
Looking around the entrance here,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.770
you rolled a 15, you said?

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.862
SAM: For traps, 23.

00:36:03.862 --> 00:36:06.883
MATT: Rolled a 23 for traps. No traps visible around this.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.790
SAM: Then I'll peek my head through the crack

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:11.770
and see if I can see anything.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.610
MATT: Okay, you glance through and the stone

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:20.530
opening seems to progress for about five or six more feet.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:24.060
And then you just see darkness beyond that.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:24.893
TRAVIS: No, problem.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.503
Not a fall at all.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.770
SAM: I will take a piece of wire and send a Message back.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.880
I know that Caleb is otherwise occupied right now,

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.440
so I will send a message to Caduceus.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.362
Mr. Clay?

00:36:40.362 --> 00:36:41.493
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah?

00:36:41.493 --> 00:36:44.880
SAM: There's there's a void. There's a crack and a hole

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.623
and a void that keeps going for forever.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.220
TALIESIN: One after another or all together at once?

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.370
SAM: What? Oh, hold on.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.203
What?

00:36:54.203 --> 00:36:55.750
TALIESIN: What?

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.394
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:36:57.394 --> 00:36:59.992
MARISHA: (laughing) Caduceus doesn't
know how answering machines work.

00:36:59.992 --> 00:37:02.220
SAM: Hi. Hi, it's me again.
TALIESIN: Oh, hey.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.748
SAM: I can only hear--

00:37:03.748 --> 00:37:06.260
(laughter)

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.920
SAM: Hi. I can only hear you after I'm done talking

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.170
and then that's it. You get to say one thing,

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.484
so say it now.

00:37:12.484 --> 00:37:13.317
TALIESIN: Now.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.685
SAM: Okay, great.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.760
So there's a void.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.490
Should I keep going or should I wait for you. Now talk.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.240
TALIESIN: I would wait if there's a void.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.680
Void sounds like a lot.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.208
You should wait.

00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:28.574
LAURA: What?
SAM: Okay.

00:37:28.574 --> 00:37:29.657
LAURA: What's going on?

00:37:29.657 --> 00:37:31.540
LIAM: ♪ There's a void, in the crack, in the wall ♪

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.790
♪ at the bottom of the sea ♪

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.623
TALIESIN: Trying to remember,

00:37:34.623 --> 00:37:36.530
it was a very confusing message.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.853
Oh, there's a void and a crack and a tunnel.

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.590
Veth didn't say if there was all together

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.327
or one at a time, but it's up ahead

00:37:44.327 --> 00:37:46.802
and I told her to wait.

00:37:46.802 --> 00:37:47.977
LAURA: Oh, that's probably pretty smart.

00:37:47.977 --> 00:37:51.450
TALIESIN: Yeah, it seems like the thing to do.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.900
MATT: So what's the marching order here?

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.130
TRAVIS: To meet up with Veth?

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.110
LAURA: Yes.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.260
TRAVIS: Oh, right, we're going down the slippery shit.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.540
MATT: Yep, one at a time.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:00.820
LAURA: I'll go.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.330
MATT: All right, so Jester's up first.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.297
Who's after Jester?

00:38:03.297 --> 00:38:05.480
MARISHA: Do we have light?
TRAVIS: I'll go after Jester.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.260
LIAM: I can have lights.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.410
MATT: Who's after Fjord?

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.900
ASHLEY: I'll go after Fjord.
LIAM: It's pitch black down here, <i>ja</i>?

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.405
MATT: All right, Yasha after Fjord?

00:38:11.405 --> 00:38:13.320
TALIESIN: I'll go after Yasha.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.590
I'll turn on a light, too.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.210
MATT: Then Beau and Caleb, who's last?

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:18.724
LIAM: I will not go last.

00:38:18.724 --> 00:38:19.730
MARISHA: I'll go last.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.490
LIAM: Yes, you will.
MATT: All righty.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.290
So. Pardon me.

00:38:25.497 --> 00:38:28.430
TALIESIN: Do we want to rope this, by the way, or no?

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.620
MATT: As you all carefully make your way down the tunnel,

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.880
which is a little tighter for the rest of you

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.950
in comparison to Veth's first go, but you use the walls

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:37.260
and you can find little finger holds

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.900
to get yourself through.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.490
Occasionally, one of the icicle handholds

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.180
snaps off and you have to drop it.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.260
Elements are fragile, some elements are actual stone

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.350
and well solidified in the environment.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.650
But nevertheless, it's a little disconcerting.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:54.001
The variations of the topography.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.759
Frumpkin is still waiting back from Veth

00:38:58.759 --> 00:39:00.870
and you can see Frumpkin's acting a little strange.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:01.933
This is like

00:39:01.933 --> 00:39:04.970
(yowling, growling)

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.840
Hair's standing up a little bit.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.870
LIAM: I see this now?

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.214
MATT: Yeah, as you enter the room.
LIAM: Well, I ask him:

00:39:09.214 --> 00:39:10.330
Here, what is the matter?

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:11.950
What has got you on edge?

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.170
MATT: You get the sense that Frumpkin just senses

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.596
strange magical energies,

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.194
and it's making him uncomfortable.

00:39:21.194 --> 00:39:22.597
LAURA: Uh-oh.

00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:25.476
LIAM: Okay, go with her. Go with Veth, go.

00:39:25.476 --> 00:39:27.690
MATT: (meows)

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.290
Trots up next to Veth.

00:39:30.158 --> 00:39:32.590
So you are all now at the end of this tunnel,

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:36.198
after making your way down the curved and descending slope.

00:39:36.198 --> 00:39:37.840
Veth, you watch as they all approach,

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.080
and you see Veth now there at the cracking opening

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.810
at the bottom of this large wall,

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.913
and just sitting there looking back at you all.

00:39:45.913 --> 00:39:47.513
LAURA: What's the plan?

00:39:47.513 --> 00:39:49.480
SAM: I mean, I don't want to volunteer anyone's pet,

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.140
but it seems like this is a job for a pet.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.748
TRAVIS: What can you see?

00:39:54.748 --> 00:39:58.450
SAM: There's this crack and through it about six feet later,

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.283
there's nothing.

00:39:59.283 --> 00:40:00.958
It could be a fall,

00:40:00.958 --> 00:40:04.933
could be gateway to the Abyss.

00:40:04.933 --> 00:40:07.739
It could be just very dark.

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:09.513
LAURA: Caleb?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay, okay.

00:40:09.513 --> 00:40:12.000
LAURA: Can you send Dancing Lights

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.400
down the little hole or something so we can see?

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.073
LIAM: I could do that.

00:40:16.073 --> 00:40:18.830
We could do either that, or we could send the cat in

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:19.840
first to look?
MARISHA: Yeah,

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.198
TALIESIN: I can put a Light spell on the cat's tail.

00:40:22.198 --> 00:40:23.031
LAURA: Ooh.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.010
LIAM: Well, I really don't feel like we're going to

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.400
surprise anyone, but perhaps we just let him go take a look.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.915
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: Does he have darkvision?

00:40:31.915 --> 00:40:33.142
LIAM: A cat?

00:40:33.142 --> 00:40:33.991
Probably not.

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:37.423
SAM: Cats can see in the dark, that seems--

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.743
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're of the devil.

00:40:39.743 --> 00:40:40.927
They can see in the dark.

00:40:40.927 --> 00:40:42.074
(laughter)

00:40:42.074 --> 00:40:44.820
TALIESIN: Wow, oh yeah.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.020
MARISHA: Don't piss off the internet, Travis.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.135
TRAVIS: (deep voice) This is my domain!

00:40:53.923 --> 00:40:56.020
LIAM: "-- rely on smell." Perception check on smell

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.146
doesn't say one way or the other.

00:40:58.146 --> 00:41:00.107
LAURA: I would put light on Frumpkin's tail.

00:41:00.107 --> 00:41:01.565
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do Frumpkin light tail.
TALIESIN: (whistling)

00:41:01.565 --> 00:41:02.906
MARISHA: 'Cause you can see through Frumpkin,

00:41:02.906 --> 00:41:05.123
but you can't see through the darkness.

00:41:06.092 --> 00:41:11.010
LIAM: Little golden globules float up to the party

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.650
and the Fey King returns as he enters the crack in the wall.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.770
MATT: All right. As as the globs one by one

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:20.015
vanish into this small squeezing tunnel,

00:41:20.015 --> 00:41:21.730
Frumpkin heads on inside.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.378
And you're looking through Frumpkin, you said?

00:41:23.378 --> 00:41:24.373
LIAM: I was about to, yeah.

00:41:24.373 --> 00:41:27.423
I put my hand behind me and grab onto Beau's shoulder.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.556
MATT: Okay.

00:41:29.556 --> 00:41:32.730
Watching Frumpkin slowly curl through this tunnel,

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.080
it does come to an abrupt end, and there is

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:40.080
about a three foot drop into a new chamber.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.350
And as the globes slowly begin to drift outward

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.560
like faintly glowing balloons

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.740
that illuminate the immediate vicinity,

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.183
you see a new chamber.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.763
Here you emerge--

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.347
well, actually you wouldn't know that

00:41:57.347 --> 00:41:59.570
because it's just Frumpkin.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.610
Shards of broken stone litter the floor in front of you.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.160
You can see smooth shapes that are left

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.650
jagged and broken, things have either impacted

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.890
or just been completely broken,

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:15.180
thrown asunder across the floor here.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.560
You can see now the floor has unique

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.300
intricately carved decorative patterns

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.033
that resemble simple geometric fractals.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.930
But it is a very, very large chamber.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.300
Just from what little bit of light you have

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.740
here in the vicinity.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.910
You do not see any other walls immediately.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.010
You'd probably have to send the light out further

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.710
and continue to explore.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.550
But as Frumpkin steps down and looks around,

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.680
you don't see a ceiling yet.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.040
You don't see a wall to either side.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.710
It's just this weird

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:51.330
broken stone surface before you

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:52.986
LAURA: Does it looks safe, Caleb?

00:42:54.683 --> 00:42:57.067
LIAM: It's very big in here

00:42:57.067 --> 00:42:59.090
and there's stones everywhere.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.150
I need more of a look around.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.070
I don't think Frumpkin's too far away.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.210
I tell him telepathically to hook to the left

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:11.090
and start going along the perimeter.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.371
TALIESIN: Probably get the ropes out.

00:43:12.371 --> 00:43:14.019
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:14.019 --> 00:43:15.630
SAM: Is there a big drop?

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:16.463
Or was it--

00:43:16.463 --> 00:43:18.110
LIAM: No, he jumped down three or four feet.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.340
MATT: Yeah, just a little drop.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.750
As Frumpkin curves around the left side of the chamber

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.620
roughly 15 or so feet later comes to a corner

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.070
and you could see there is a--

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.970
looks to be another wall,

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.430
though it is a little smoother and the designs are different

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.870
and a little more disparate in comparison to the floor.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.520
And also looking to the left, the same pattern

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.160
that's on the floor is on the wall behind Frumpkin.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.633
The wall where you pass through and out of.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.573
Heading along that side, Frumpkin heads on

00:43:50.573 --> 00:43:54.290
for about 50 or so feet walking the perimeter.

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.290
You can now see similar design, similar patterns,

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:01.170
but the broken bits of stone also now throw in

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:03.210
elements of shattered furniture.

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:05.650
You can see stone sculptures

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:09.570
that themselves are in seven, eight different pieces.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:12.860
And then hundreds of small bits just thrown around

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.693
in the vicinity.

00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:15.310
LIAM: Before you go any further, do the patterns

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.256
mean anything to me? Are they at all

00:44:17.256 --> 00:44:21.370
resembling dunamantic patterns or anything?

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:22.520
MATT: Make an arcana check.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:26.263
LIAM: Natural 20.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:28.103
MATT: Okay.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.770
The patterns, you gather

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.670
nothing dunamantic about them.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:40.660
There are elements to them that remind you of simple,

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.120
rudimentary glyphs.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.930
We're talking beginning of school

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.390
when you're first learning to write,

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:49.380
copy and understand spellcraft.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.130
But these are not functional.

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:55.060
They're artistic interpretations.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.415
They are--

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.073
they are implicitly made to be decorative.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.720
LIAM: But related to--?

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.750
MATT: Related to.
LIAM: Arcane glyphs, so--

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.880
MATT: Like if you were to see the letter M,

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.100
but there was so much unique scrolling

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.650
and design work around the M that it just becomes

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:16.910
this beautiful piece of art that is based on an M.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:20.480
LIAM: There is a decoration inside that is meant

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.196
to emulate and embellish and revere

00:45:26.213 --> 00:45:27.954
the arcane.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:30.790
TALIESIN: That worries me, but okay.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:32.114
MARISHA: I mean, that tracks.

00:45:32.114 --> 00:45:34.583
LAURA: I mean, it's a magic city.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.120
Can we go, is it safe?

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:39.953
Should we go?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.894
LIAM: I will send him further.

00:45:42.894 --> 00:45:45.593
MATT: All right. Make a perception check with him.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.900
LIAM: One.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.970
MARISHA: Sometimes it's just
about expression and storytelling.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:52.803
TALIESIN: Why not use paint?

00:45:52.803 --> 00:45:55.360
MATT: Continuing on for another 50 or 60 feet

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.560
comes to another corner.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.400
LIAM: What shape are we talking about?

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.910
MATT: So you're entering, and there was a wall behind--

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:03.460
LIAM: So flat?
MATT: -- and a floor; flat.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.330
LIAM: Flat, okay.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.560
MATT: And then eventually there was a corner here

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.160
in which the surface area changed.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.873
But the wall here and the floor is the same pattern.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.450
And then the corner hits here

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:15.660
and there's another edge to it.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.350
You can now see the opposite wall about 60 or so feet

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.790
beyond where you first came into the chamber

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.250
and there, the floor pattern continues again on this side.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.910
LIAM: Okay.

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:28.200
Looking for other passages out of here, doors.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.310
MATT: Indeed. Frumpkin goes around, seeing nothing.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:33.723
LIAM: Nothing, yeah.

00:46:33.723 --> 00:46:34.980
I think we're going to have to go in.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.920
I don't see anything immediately.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.453
It looks like ruins, old ruins.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.120
LAURA: Can we fit through the crack or is it?

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.853
MATT: You can, very uncomfortably, but it's doable.

00:46:46.853 --> 00:46:48.930
MARISHA: Does there look like any sign

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.550
that Molly &amp; Co. have been through here?

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:54.020
If this is the direction that they went?

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.650
MATT: You can check the ground, if you'd like to.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.700
Investigation or perception, your choice.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:59.950
MARISHA: Why not?

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:03.320
Not rolling great at all tonight.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.630
19.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.137
MATT: 19, still pretty decent.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.410
Unfortunately, you don't see anything that specifically says

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:15.650
Molly's crew or Molly, but you do see a number of footprints

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.670
going in and out, some of different ages.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.677
Some that might've been your group's at this point

00:47:19.677 --> 00:47:21.950
since you've all been in here waiting.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.720
Just can't quite see anything that

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.080
definitively tells you that.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:26.913
MARISHA: Cool.

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:29.143
All right.

00:47:29.143 --> 00:47:30.590
TALIESIN: I say we run a rope.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:31.423
SAM: Run a rope?

00:47:31.423 --> 00:47:34.010
TALIESIN: And you go first,
put a little weight on it so that

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.320
if somebody gets stuck, they can pull their way through.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.153
LAURA: Oh, smart.

00:47:37.153 --> 00:47:39.750
TALIESIN: And then the last person
will just take it with them.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.583
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:40.583 --> 00:47:42.160
SAM: Sure, who's got rope?

00:47:43.877 --> 00:47:46.324
LAURA: Fjord?
SAM: Give me a rope.

00:47:46.324 --> 00:47:47.865
TRAVIS: (tossing)

00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:48.961
SAM: Ugh!

00:47:48.961 --> 00:47:50.795
(laughter)

00:47:50.795 --> 00:47:51.911
TRAVIS: It's 50 feet of rope.

00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:53.044
SAM: It's very heavy.

00:47:53.044 --> 00:47:55.961
50 feet of rope is, like, 100 pounds.

00:47:57.189 --> 00:47:59.219
TRAVIS: It's like one and a half, but yeah, sure, okay.

00:47:59.219 --> 00:48:01.088
(laughter)

00:48:01.088 --> 00:48:03.407
Nah, it's heavy.
You're right, I'm sorry.

00:48:03.407 --> 00:48:05.600
TALIESIN: Really, it's too much to add to this conversation.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.110
SAM: All right, I will

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.540
defy everyone's advice and I will turn invisible.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.010
MATT: Okay.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.720
SAM: And carry the rope in.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.070
MATT: All right.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.870
So you squeeze through, and for you--

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:20.050
for Veth you can get onto your hands and knees

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:21.670
and make your way through without much of an issue,

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.813
holding the rope as you go invisible.

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:25.967
The ones that'll have the biggest issue

00:48:25.967 --> 00:48:29.000
getting in here will be probably Yasha and Caduceus.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.983
And even Fjord, to an extent.

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.820
It's not a huge challenge, but it does make you feel

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.410
a little claustrophobic in having to push through

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:41.050
this six, seven-foot period where you are having to

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:44.110
exhale at certain points to force your body

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:45.673
through the next few inches.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.650
But one by one, with the rope's aid,

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.200
you all eventually make your way into this chamber.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.090
TRAVIS: Just getting vague flashbacks to when

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:57.865
someone followed us into a place

00:48:57.865 --> 00:49:00.255
and let us open a thing--
MARISHA: Uh-huh, and we did all of the work for them?

00:49:00.255 --> 00:49:01.088
Absolutely.

00:49:01.088 --> 00:49:02.835
ASHLEY: Can we make this bigger?

00:49:02.835 --> 00:49:03.823
You know what I mean?

00:49:03.823 --> 00:49:05.451
It's like if they already made an entrance

00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:06.670
they should carve out a bigger.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:07.700
TRAVIS: I agree.
ASHLEY: This is stupid.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.533
TRAVIS: Lazy.

00:49:08.533 --> 00:49:10.305
TALIESIN: Is there any way we can

00:49:10.305 --> 00:49:12.030
put an alarm or something on this

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:13.270
so we know if someone--

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.300
LIAM: Sure, we could do that.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.930
But I send the four globules spiraling slowly up

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:20.466
into the room and I want to get

00:49:20.466 --> 00:49:23.520
a better picture of the room we're in.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.928
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check for me.

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:26.153
LIAM: Ay yi yi yi.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.870
20.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:31.083
MATT: Okay, so.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.410
You can now see that fractal pattern

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:38.810
that you recognize along the floor, the wall behind you,

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:40.070
the wall on the opposite end

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:43.760
and now the ceiling above you, it continues.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.260
And the more disparate pattern

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:51.027
and marble-like texture is on the wall to left

00:49:51.027 --> 00:49:53.080
and the wall to the right.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:57.096
You do see two different openings

00:49:57.096 --> 00:49:58.612
that exit this chamber.

00:49:58.612 --> 00:50:02.280
On the opposite wall and it's fit against

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.890
the far right side and it's coming out at an angle.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:06.833
Just an opening.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:12.830
And then on the ceiling, you see another similar

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:17.340
arched opening that is affixed to where the ceiling

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.340
and the far right wall meet.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:21.510
SAM: Does it look like we are in a room

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.180
that's been turned on its side?

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:25.220
MATT: That's exactly what it looks like.

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.280
You also see, on the far right wall,

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.180
there is a large stone circular structure that looks

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.030
like it's splintered and broken and numerous pieces

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:37.030
of the shattered stonework that you see all across the floor

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.720
appears to have originated from

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.140
mostly whatever was once there, whether it be a fountain

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.633
or an art piece or numerous art pieces.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:51.400
All the things that you see scattered across the floor here

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.940
that aren't just broken structural pieces of stone

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.440
and other materials are bits of shale

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.350
and shattered pottery and elements of wooden furniture

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:06.800
that has long either frozen over or left

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.890
dried and forgotten amongst the rest of the debris.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.740
But you do see around the room, beyond just those elements,

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:15.460
what you now recognize to be a sideways doorway

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.550
on the opposite wall.

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:17.910
And then one in the ceiling.

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:20.040
LIAM: How high up is that ceiling?

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.614
MATT: Roughly 40, 45 feet.

00:51:22.614 --> 00:51:23.647
LIAM: Okay.

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:26.723
MARISHA: Can we get any type of idea
of what this room once was?

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.310
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.153
SAM: Guidance.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.523
MARISHA: Not-- I'm rolling horribly, nine.

00:51:41.413 --> 00:51:42.869
MATT: Nine?

00:51:42.869 --> 00:51:43.702
TRAVIS: Nein!

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:45.563
MATT: It's hard to tell.

00:51:45.563 --> 00:51:49.000
I mean, based on the size of it,

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.570
it's not incredibly massive,

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.880
but where it would be, the ceiling would be high.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.640
It seems to be well-decorated

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.183
and there's intricacy to the interior, so.

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:02.840
Whatever it was used for, there was definitely a--

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:06.310
it was intentionally aesthetically pleasing.

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:12.710
TALIESIN: What kind of furniture is still left unbroken

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:16.543
or recognizable other than a couple chairs?

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:20.740
MATT: It looks like splintered elements of a table

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.083
or a bench of some kind.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.710
There's not a lot of wood. Most of it's stone

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:27.113
or clay.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:30.100
TRAVIS: The two exits in the room,

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.020
the foot traffic that we've been seeing

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.193
outside of this room,

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:37.330
majority of it heading to either of those two exits?

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:38.690
MATT: You can go ahead and check, if you'd like.

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:41.196
TRAVIS: I'd like to.
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:52:41.196 --> 00:52:42.212
And the room is still cold.

00:52:42.212 --> 00:52:47.020
It's not as cold as the previous entrance

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.047
and the exterior of this.

00:52:48.047 --> 00:52:50.430
But the interior of this chamber itself,

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.920
while you do see an element of ice in some places,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.940
it seems to have gotten warmer since you've entered.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.030
TALIESIN: There's a stone table?

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:58.700
TRAVIS: 25 on the foot traffic.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.790
MATT: There are elements of a broken stone table

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:02.290
in, like, 17 different pieces.

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:04.507
TALIESIN: I'd like to find a
couple of pieces, not touch them,

00:53:04.507 --> 00:53:06.820
but I want to look to see if they're stained at all

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.000
or off-color.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.950
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I have a hunch.

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.191
MATT: Okay, while you're doing that, you rolled a what?

00:53:13.191 --> 00:53:14.198
TRAVIS: 25.

00:53:14.198 --> 00:53:15.365
MATT: 25.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.440
You're hard pressed to find specific footprints

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.310
since there is no dirt or sediment here,

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:26.210
but you see some patterns of movement through the debris

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:28.950
where plainly things that should have been

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:30.550
left undisturbed had been moved.

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.100
It's hard to tell exactly which ones have

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:39.030
been most recently turned, but there has been traffic

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:41.470
to the previous doorway and back.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.200
As well as some areas where you can see a lot of the

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:47.660
local debris has been broken into smaller pieces

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.410
from an impact from above.

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:52.590
So there's been traffic to both.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.423
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:53:53.423 --> 00:53:55.150
LAURA: We could just levitate up, right?

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.720
SAM: I can levitate up, if you want.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.110
LAURA: With a rope and hook it on

00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:59.830
and we can all climb up.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.990
SAM: Sure, should we check the one that we can see

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:04.020
down here first?

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.853
ASHLEY: Can I--

00:54:04.853 --> 00:54:06.230
LAURA: That one seems more interesting.

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:07.770
SAM: I agree 100 percent.

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:08.603
By the way, I'm over here.

00:54:08.603 --> 00:54:10.960
MATT: Nothing stained that you can tell.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.640
The stone chunks that you can find have themselves

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.550
intricate carvings, not quite as intricate as like

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.120
the walls that you see around here

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.040
and of a different design.

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.320
It's more just for aesthetics.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.120
Grooves and--

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.610
TALIESIN: No, weird stains or anything?

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:30.170
No sign that anything weird was used on it?

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:31.003
SAM: Shine a black light on it.

00:54:31.003 --> 00:54:33.765
MATT: Not to that degree that you can discover.

00:54:33.765 --> 00:54:38.750
ASHLEY: Can I, this is so stupid, but I'm going to go over

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:43.729
and does my foot stick to the floor of the wall?

00:54:43.729 --> 00:54:45.920
and does my foot stick to the floor of the wall?

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.690
Like--
SAM: Like Spider-Man?

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:52.057
ASHLEY: Like, you know, if we maybe--
if we can start walking.

00:54:52.057 --> 00:54:53.910
Yeah, it's like a--

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:56.500
MATT: So you walk over, put your foot on the wall

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:59.440
and then go to lift your other foot.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.160
And there's no purchase there.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.760
You catch yourself.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:04.582
A good idea, but--

00:55:04.582 --> 00:55:06.371
TRAVIS: Yeah, that'd have been gang busters.

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:08.543
TALIESIN: That would have been cool.

00:55:08.543 --> 00:55:10.500
TRAVIS: All right, so help me out
on the layout of this room.

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.700
So we're in a room that looks like

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.800
it was turned on its side.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.821
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: There's a wall behind us, two on--

00:55:14.821 --> 00:55:17.237
LAURA: Which is the ceiling.
The wall behind us is the ceiling.

00:55:17.237 --> 00:55:20.076
MATT: It's a mostly cube-looking chamber on its side.

00:55:20.076 --> 00:55:22.060
You have an entrance across the way

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.510
and an entrance above.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.670
TRAVIS: Okay, so one in front of us and one above us.

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:27.448
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: I feel like the one above us is the way out.

00:55:27.448 --> 00:55:28.980
TRAVIS: So to the back and to the left and to the right

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.910
are just flat walls.

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:30.743
MATT: Correct.

00:55:30.743 --> 00:55:34.150
LIAM: And the doorway that's relatively level with us

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:35.738
is sealed or open?

00:55:35.738 --> 00:55:38.550
MATT: It's open. They're both not-- they're both archways,

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:39.383
on their sides.

00:55:39.383 --> 00:55:40.883
They're just open. There's no door.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.230
MARISHA: So the one, the upstairs one

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:49.000
would theoretically be the one that was

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.680
going down, maybe, right?

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.000
TRAVIS: No, I think it went like this.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.121
MARISHA: It was like this so it would go, I don't know.

00:55:56.121 --> 00:55:58.220
MATT: They both would have been level, right?

00:55:58.220 --> 00:55:59.782
Like, so if this was here

00:55:59.782 --> 00:56:01.644
and then the room is now like this.

00:56:01.644 --> 00:56:03.164
LIAM: So one door is lying down--

00:56:03.164 --> 00:56:04.820
LAURA: So it's just a horizontal doorway in front of us.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.890
TRAVIS: The hole that we crawled in from is in the ceiling?

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.290
MATT: It's on the wall behind you just a few feet.

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.720
It wasn't intentionally.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.340
LIAM: I'm walking over to the one that is lying

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.120
on its side because that's easy, and I'm going to peer

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.680
into whatever is next.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.533
MATT: Okay, it's about, this one that you see

00:56:19.533 --> 00:56:20.840
is about 10 feet off the ground.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.100
So you would have to climb up a little bit

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.400
to look through.
TALIESIN: Or send the cat.

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.750
SAM: Are you guys talking the floor ceiling

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:28.892
or the ceiling floor?
LAURA: I lift Caleb up on my shoulders.

00:56:28.892 --> 00:56:30.760
LIAM: All right, I am on top of Jester's shoulders.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.346
So walk me over.
LAURA: I'm pushing him up so that he can look

00:56:32.346 --> 00:56:33.340
through the doorway.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.598
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Easy does it.

00:56:34.598 --> 00:56:36.990
MATT: All right, so as you both make your way

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:40.430
over to the edge, you lock your arms onto the outer rim

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:43.240
of this archway and pull yourself and look in.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.000
There is no light in the next chamber.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.411
If you'd like to move your globules in there as well.
LIAM: Oh, yeah I'll bring the globules--

00:56:47.411 --> 00:56:49.414
Oh, I grab hold of Jester's horns.

00:56:49.414 --> 00:56:50.247
LAURA: Ow!

00:56:50.247 --> 00:56:53.118
LIAM: And bring the globules over.
LAURA: They're more sensitive than you think.

00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:57.126
LIAM: Vroom vroom, vroom.

00:56:58.690 --> 00:56:59.950
TRAVIS: Moped.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.438
MATT: All right.
LAURA: I take off.

00:57:02.438 --> 00:57:04.460
(laughter)

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:07.550
TRAVIS: ♪ The leader of the pack ♪ Vroom vroom.

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:10.147
MATT: So looking into this next area.

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:16.000
There's a brief hallway that continues on

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.430
that is broken and shifted.

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:21.680
So whatever this chamber you're in right now,

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.270
it looks like it dislodged and is at a different angle

00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:25.940
than the next chamber ahead of you.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.106
LIAM: Interesting.
MATT: The next one

00:57:27.106 --> 00:57:30.090
looks to be mostly righted,

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:33.983
but it still begins to go to a decline.

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:36.520
It's at an odd angle and downward.

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.450
LIAM: Okay, and any doors or archways of any kind

00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:41.897
along its path?

00:57:41.897 --> 00:57:42.837
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:57:42.837 --> 00:57:44.156
LIAM: Just because of the darkness.

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:47.190
That is 25.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.228
MATT: 25, dang.

00:57:48.637 --> 00:57:51.957
MATT: All right, looking in, this is a larger chamber.

00:57:51.957 --> 00:57:53.597
As the globules make their way in,

00:57:53.597 --> 00:57:55.687
you immediately can see the glittering around you

00:57:55.687 --> 00:57:58.927
of numerous ice crystals everywhere,

00:57:58.927 --> 00:58:00.887
the floor, the wall, the ceilings.

00:58:00.887 --> 00:58:04.607
The temperature is much colder in this room.

00:58:04.607 --> 00:58:06.837
And you can see along all surfaces

00:58:06.837 --> 00:58:08.527
it is just a coating of ice.

00:58:08.527 --> 00:58:11.547
You can see some elements of jagged rising crystal

00:58:11.547 --> 00:58:13.697
that has just been building up over time.

00:58:13.697 --> 00:58:17.357
Some small-- actually, the entire ceiling, as you look up

00:58:17.357 --> 00:58:19.747
itself is covered in icicles.

00:58:19.747 --> 00:58:22.477
It looks almost like just row after row after row of teeth,

00:58:22.477 --> 00:58:24.387
as they all ominously make their way down

00:58:24.387 --> 00:58:26.627
from this high ceiling.

00:58:26.627 --> 00:58:28.197
Glancing inside, you can see

00:58:29.467 --> 00:58:32.547
four stone braziers,

00:58:32.547 --> 00:58:34.197
five feet tall, that sit

00:58:34.197 --> 00:58:35.617
in the middle of the chamber.

00:58:35.617 --> 00:58:37.507
And then as it slides down

00:58:37.507 --> 00:58:41.004
to the very very bottom of the opposite edge, as you

00:58:41.004 --> 00:58:44.427
will the lights to make their way further in,

00:58:44.427 --> 00:58:46.320
you can see a set of double doors

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.807
on the opposite end.

00:58:47.807 --> 00:58:49.707
A different coloration, but also themselves

00:58:49.707 --> 00:58:51.697
glittering a little bit from the nearby light

00:58:51.697 --> 00:58:53.867
with it looks like ice that has coated the vicinity.

00:58:53.867 --> 00:58:57.027
LIAM: So, a long, icy path, lots of icicles coming down,

00:58:57.027 --> 00:58:58.507
four stone braziers in the center

00:58:58.507 --> 00:58:59.787
and then it keeps slanting down

00:58:59.787 --> 00:59:01.407
with two sealed double doors.
MATT: Correct. Yes.

00:59:01.407 --> 00:59:02.857
LAURA: Do you see footprints, Caleb?

00:59:02.857 --> 00:59:05.517
LIAM: Do I see footprints is a great question.

00:59:05.517 --> 00:59:08.737
MATT: From your angle here, looking up into the tunnel,

00:59:08.737 --> 00:59:10.677
you'd have to get closer to really inspect the floor.

00:59:10.677 --> 00:59:13.877
You don't see anything at this distance.

00:59:13.877 --> 00:59:15.817
LIAM: This-- you know, I just wanted to take a peek in here.

00:59:15.817 --> 00:59:17.047
Maybe we want to figure out--

00:59:17.047 --> 00:59:19.607
Fjord, you were poking around underneath

00:59:19.607 --> 00:59:22.503
the hole in the ceiling?

00:59:22.503 --> 00:59:23.670
SAM: The wall door.

00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:25.411
LIAM: The wall door? The wall door...

00:59:25.411 --> 00:59:26.244
TRAVIS: Which one is that?

00:59:26.244 --> 00:59:27.703
LAURA: The one in the...
LIAM: The other one.

00:59:27.703 --> 00:59:29.157
The one that's not this.

00:59:29.157 --> 00:59:31.142
LAURA: That was in the ceiling.
TRAVIS: The one that's 40 feet in the air?

00:59:31.142 --> 00:59:32.350
SAM: No!

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:33.490
Wait, yes?
LAURA: Yes.

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:34.898
MATT: Yes.

00:59:34.898 --> 00:59:36.557
LIAM: Yes.

00:59:36.557 --> 00:59:39.167
So we could go in here, but you seemed interested

00:59:39.167 --> 00:59:40.857
in the one above us.

00:59:40.857 --> 00:59:41.737
So maybe we want to-

00:59:41.737 --> 00:59:43.748
TRAVIS: (laughing) I was just generally interested in the

00:59:43.748 --> 00:59:46.917
structure of this fucking hamster cage!

00:59:46.917 --> 00:59:47.967
I'm just trying to get my bearings.

00:59:47.967 --> 00:59:51.117
LIAM: Well, I think we should take a peek into both

00:59:51.117 --> 00:59:53.437
and make our decision after we've peeked into both.

00:59:53.437 --> 00:59:56.277
So, I relay everything that I just saw.

00:59:56.277 --> 00:59:59.217
But let's work on the harder to reach.

00:59:59.217 --> 01:00:00.977
LAURA: Can you float up, Veth?

01:00:00.977 --> 01:00:01.820
SAM: I could.

01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:04.577
Is that-- yes, I can.

01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:06.835
Anyone else prefer to?

01:00:06.835 --> 01:00:08.267
MARISHA: That would use a spell?

01:00:08.267 --> 01:00:09.259
SAM: Yeah, that's okay.

01:00:09.259 --> 01:00:10.287
LIAM: I could also use my boots--
SAM: That's what they're for.

01:00:10.287 --> 01:00:11.787
LIAM: -- if you don't want to go alone.

01:00:11.787 --> 01:00:14.124
LAURA: If you can do that without using a spell slot.

01:00:14.124 --> 01:00:15.492
LIAM: Yeah, I can.
LAURA: Yeah, sure!

01:00:15.492 --> 01:00:16.757
TALIESIN: Take the rope.
ASHLEY: Take the end of the rope.

01:00:16.757 --> 01:00:18.273
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

01:00:18.273 --> 01:00:19.106
Okay.

01:00:19.106 --> 01:00:21.367
MARISHA: Is this a situation--
LAURA: You could just use your boots to lift, okay--

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:24.027
MARISHA: -- where my movement would be useful?

01:00:24.027 --> 01:00:25.837
LIAM: I can only do it once a day.
MARISHA: To run up a wall?

01:00:25.837 --> 01:00:27.177
LAURA: Okay, okay.
ASHLEY: Oh, I didn't need to do it.

01:00:27.177 --> 01:00:28.297
MARISHA: My wall and...

01:00:29.467 --> 01:00:32.157
TALIESIN: Technically...
MARISHA: My walls and water?

01:00:32.157 --> 01:00:33.190
TALIESIN: Technically, the door would be--

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:35.027
MATT: For your movement?
MARISHA: My unarmored movement

01:00:35.027 --> 01:00:36.227
that I have as a monk?

01:00:36.227 --> 01:00:38.577
MATT: It's-- unfortunately, because the doorway

01:00:38.577 --> 01:00:40.497
is not flush against the wall,

01:00:40.497 --> 01:00:41.797
it's flush against the ceiling,

01:00:41.797 --> 01:00:42.630
you would run up the wall

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:45.354
and then have no way of running across the ceiling

01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:47.617
to get there, the way that gravity

01:00:47.617 --> 01:00:48.450
and physics work.
MARISHA: Just didn't know if there

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:51.147
was a chandelier for me to swing on, you know?

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.517
MATT: Not really, unfortunately.

01:00:52.517 --> 01:00:53.350
MARISHA: Okay.

01:00:54.407 --> 01:00:55.927
TALEISIN: Once there's a rope, though, you can--

01:00:55.927 --> 01:00:57.077
MATT: That's true.

01:00:57.077 --> 01:00:58.947
So what's doing what? Who's doing what?

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:01.027
LIAM: I take the rope from Caduceus,

01:01:01.027 --> 01:01:04.285
and say, look at me, I'm Yasha! (whoosh)

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:07.837
And I use the boots-- the Stormrider Boots

01:01:07.837 --> 01:01:09.847
to launch myself up through the hole.

01:01:09.847 --> 01:01:10.680
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: The door.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.513
MATT: How far can it take you?

01:01:11.513 --> 01:01:13.557
LIAM: Oh, very far.

01:01:13.557 --> 01:01:14.567
90 feet.

01:01:14.567 --> 01:01:17.237
MATT: Yeah, so you guys watch as Caleb,

01:01:17.237 --> 01:01:20.787
like an electric rocket, suddenly just (whooshes)

01:01:20.787 --> 01:01:23.487
takes off. There's a circle of dust

01:01:23.487 --> 01:01:26.287
that goes (boof) around the base, clearing out

01:01:26.287 --> 01:01:29.037
a lot of the shards of nearby rock and shale.

01:01:29.037 --> 01:01:30.967
Just (whooshes) shoot out from the sides,

01:01:30.967 --> 01:01:35.230
leaving this little circle of clean floor beneath him.

01:01:36.347 --> 01:01:38.998
As you rocket upward--
LIAM: Coming through!

01:01:38.998 --> 01:01:42.101
MATT: (zooming sound) It's about 40
or so feet up, you go through it

01:01:42.101 --> 01:01:45.577
and then quickly realize, the next ceiling is shorter.

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:47.037
It's only about 25 feet.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.467
LIAM: I'm in control of distance.

01:01:48.467 --> 01:01:50.187
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: It's not 90 feet, splat.

01:01:50.187 --> 01:01:51.097
MATT: Right, no, I know.

01:01:51.097 --> 01:01:52.880
LIAM: Okay. That'd be cool.
MATT: I'm letting you know,

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.607
you realize you haven't--

01:01:54.607 --> 01:01:55.847
you realize as you go upward

01:01:55.847 --> 01:01:58.347
to slow and you would have to

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.797
arc a little bit so you don't plummet

01:01:59.797 --> 01:02:01.657
back through the entrance you came with.

01:02:01.657 --> 01:02:03.337
So, you do so.

01:02:03.337 --> 01:02:05.997
You land with a bit of a heavy hit,

01:02:05.997 --> 01:02:08.297
catch yourself on your knees

01:02:08.297 --> 01:02:10.177
and look within the surrounding chamber around you.

01:02:10.177 --> 01:02:11.767
It is dark up in here.

01:02:11.767 --> 01:02:12.900
You wait a moment to go ahead

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.492
and bring the lights--
MARISHA: Up in here! Up in here! (laughs)

01:02:16.565 --> 01:02:17.398
Sorry.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.815
LIAM: Up in here!

01:02:19.815 --> 01:02:22.577
(laughter)

01:02:22.577 --> 01:02:26.290
MATT: You are met with a partially collapsed chamber.

01:02:27.337 --> 01:02:31.837
About 60 or so feet from side to side,

01:02:31.837 --> 01:02:33.227
and then 30 feet wide across

01:02:33.227 --> 01:02:35.307
and only about 25 feet above.

01:02:35.307 --> 01:02:38.557
It looks like what would have been a wall or a ceiling here

01:02:38.557 --> 01:02:40.137
has collapsed in at an angle,

01:02:40.137 --> 01:02:42.577
and a majority of this room is under rubble

01:02:42.577 --> 01:02:43.730
on the opposite side.

01:02:44.757 --> 01:02:46.917
It would've been larger but now,

01:02:46.917 --> 01:02:49.877
much of it is just under debris.

01:02:49.877 --> 01:02:53.727
Large 10, 15, 20-foot slabs of stone

01:02:53.727 --> 01:02:55.947
are partially broken and over and blocking

01:02:55.947 --> 01:02:58.997
any sort of other exit on the opposite side of the room.

01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:01.200
And if you look behind you on the other end,

01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:04.337
you can see other elements of broken stone

01:03:04.337 --> 01:03:05.927
and other pieces of furniture,

01:03:05.927 --> 01:03:07.827
actually more furniture in here than there was

01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:09.247
in the room you just came from.

01:03:09.247 --> 01:03:11.047
But also, similarly shattered

01:03:11.047 --> 01:03:13.807
and sent scattered all across the ground.

01:03:13.807 --> 01:03:16.097
This room also does contain a similar glitter

01:03:16.097 --> 01:03:19.900
of just a general sheet of ice over everything.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.781
And as you exhale a bit into the low light

01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:24.157
and your breath clouds around you,

01:03:24.157 --> 01:03:26.887
you can see there's odd striations

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:29.477
in some of the ice in certain edges.

01:03:29.477 --> 01:03:33.297
And there are a lot of these tall stalagmites

01:03:33.297 --> 01:03:35.977
that seem to have risen up and gathered

01:03:35.977 --> 01:03:37.417
from stalactites that are reaching down

01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:38.887
and haven't quite connected in the middle

01:03:38.887 --> 01:03:42.827
in certain places, but some of these are extremely long.

01:03:42.827 --> 01:03:45.377
LIAM: Have some of them met in the middle?

01:03:45.377 --> 01:03:47.077
MATT: I would say maybe two of them,

01:03:47.077 --> 01:03:49.177
but many have just been--

01:03:49.177 --> 01:03:52.597
they haven't found enough moisture at a certain point.

01:03:52.597 --> 01:03:55.737
LIAM: So I will find a column of ice,

01:03:55.737 --> 01:03:58.937
the thickest I can find to start tying the rope

01:03:58.937 --> 01:04:00.627
tight so that the others can climb up,

01:04:00.627 --> 01:04:02.087
and while I'm doing that, I'm looking around

01:04:02.087 --> 01:04:05.427
for any possible exit out of this chamber that I'm in.

01:04:05.427 --> 01:04:06.597
MATT: Okay.

01:04:06.597 --> 01:04:08.807
You guys watch as the rope gets pulled up

01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:12.627
and then you get the signal that it's been tied taught,

01:04:12.627 --> 01:04:14.247
and who's going to climb up first?

01:04:14.247 --> 01:04:15.818
LIAM: Hurry up, slowpokes!

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:18.114
SAM: Is that-- is up-- is this the way we want to go?

01:04:18.114 --> 01:04:19.207
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go.
SAM: We're doing this?

01:04:19.207 --> 01:04:20.392
MARISHA: Yeah, are we going this way?
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll climb up.

01:04:20.392 --> 01:04:21.227
MATT: So Fjord is climbing up.

01:04:21.227 --> 01:04:23.577
Make a perception check while you're doing that.

01:04:23.577 --> 01:04:27.018
LIAM: Perception check, that is 15.

01:04:27.018 --> 01:04:28.073
MATT: 15. Okay.

01:04:30.817 --> 01:04:34.107
You do not see any signs of exits

01:04:34.107 --> 01:04:36.377
or egress from this chamber.

01:04:37.337 --> 01:04:38.837
That odd striation once again

01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:40.727
catches your eye and you look

01:04:40.727 --> 01:04:44.127
to the edges of these icy corners.

01:04:44.127 --> 01:04:46.257
And it looks textured.

01:04:46.257 --> 01:04:50.403
Almost like some sort of material.

01:04:50.403 --> 01:04:54.087
Some patterned material is heavily bundled

01:04:54.087 --> 01:04:56.912
in some of these corner regions.

01:04:58.587 --> 01:04:59.565
ASHLEY: Underneath the ice?

01:04:59.565 --> 01:05:00.398
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:05:00.398 --> 01:05:03.217
LIAM: Not within ice, but hidden below it?

01:05:03.217 --> 01:05:05.117
Like it was part of this chamber to being with?

01:05:05.117 --> 01:05:06.383
MATT: Possibly, yeah.

01:05:08.139 --> 01:05:09.997
LIAM: (sighs)

01:05:09.997 --> 01:05:11.822
Detect Magic.
MATT: You get up.

01:05:13.727 --> 01:05:15.967
SAM: Is that a SWAT team signal,
Travis, that you were doing?

01:05:15.967 --> 01:05:16.827
TRAVIS: Just climbing a rope.

01:05:16.827 --> 01:05:17.660
SAM: Oh, cool.

01:05:19.152 --> 01:05:19.985
TRAVIS: Go, go.

01:05:19.985 --> 01:05:21.693
LIAM: Go, go, go.
SAM: Go, go, go, go!

01:05:21.693 --> 01:05:23.068
(chuckling)

01:05:23.068 --> 01:05:24.777
MATT: So, detecting magic, you do not get

01:05:24.777 --> 01:05:28.967
any specific magical auras localized around you,

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.797
but there is a general film in the air in general.

01:05:31.797 --> 01:05:36.797
There's just a faint, ever-present, magical aura

01:05:36.877 --> 01:05:40.517
that fills all space around you.

01:05:40.517 --> 01:05:43.337
MARISHA: And it's making patterns in the ice?

01:05:43.337 --> 01:05:47.567
Almost like when you put a speaker next to water?

01:05:47.567 --> 01:05:48.837
Is it that type of a thing?

01:05:48.837 --> 01:05:50.044
Where you can almost see the...?

01:05:50.044 --> 01:05:51.817
MATT: And at the distance where he is right now

01:05:51.817 --> 01:05:53.397
towards the entrance, that's what it looks like,

01:05:53.397 --> 01:05:54.863
but it's still low light--
MARISHA: Oh sorry.

01:05:54.863 --> 01:05:56.077
MATT: -- and those are at the far edges of the chamber.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:57.220
MARISHA: Climb.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.270
LAURA: What do you see?
TRAVIS: Milk the cow.

01:05:58.270 --> 01:05:59.587
MARISHA: Milk the cow? Milk the cow.

01:05:59.587 --> 01:06:01.256
MATT: There you go.

01:06:01.256 --> 01:06:02.239
MARISHA: I'm up.
TALIESIN: All right.

01:06:02.239 --> 01:06:03.072
MATT: All right.

01:06:03.072 --> 01:06:04.365
LIAM: I'm going to wait 'til everyone's up.

01:06:04.365 --> 01:06:05.739
LAURA: Are we all going up?
LIAM: I'm not going to poke at anything.

01:06:05.739 --> 01:06:06.864
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.
SAM: We're not going to

01:06:06.864 --> 01:06:08.917
do the other?
LAURA: We all fit in here?

01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:09.750
MATT: Yeah.

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:10.583
It's...

01:06:12.037 --> 01:06:13.040
Yeah, you'd all fit in here.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.537
LAURA: Okay, is it like being in a attic?

01:06:15.537 --> 01:06:17.647
MATT: Certain edges, because it is a a slanted ceiling

01:06:17.647 --> 01:06:19.187
and it's a partial collapse,

01:06:19.187 --> 01:06:20.737
and the chamber is, because of that,

01:06:20.737 --> 01:06:23.157
smaller than it was originally built to be.

01:06:23.157 --> 01:06:25.687
But you all fit in here with various levels of comfort

01:06:25.687 --> 01:06:27.397
and the floor, since it is a lot of broken rock,

01:06:27.397 --> 01:06:30.067
you can't all be clustered together in one spot.

01:06:30.067 --> 01:06:31.647
You have to separate out a little bit

01:06:31.647 --> 01:06:34.387
and make your way into a more

01:06:34.387 --> 01:06:36.761
open pocket to feel comfortable.

01:06:36.761 --> 01:06:37.970
TRAVIS: ♪ Making my way. ♪

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:40.259
MARISHA: Are we going this way or
are we just checking it out?

01:06:40.259 --> 01:06:41.092
TALIESIN: I'm looking around,

01:06:41.092 --> 01:06:42.333
seeing anything weird.
LIAM: We can decide.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:43.449
You were poking about

01:06:43.449 --> 01:06:48.432
and it looked like there was movement beneath this archway.

01:06:49.317 --> 01:06:50.150
In the ceiling.

01:06:51.177 --> 01:06:52.927
Is what Matt told you.

01:06:52.927 --> 01:06:54.427
TRAVIS: He did?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:55.427
MATT: Movement?
MARISHA: Movement?

01:06:55.427 --> 01:06:57.577
LIAM: No, earlier,

01:06:57.577 --> 01:07:00.357
people asked if we could tell where people had been

01:07:00.357 --> 01:07:02.257
and you had described it looked like there was

01:07:02.257 --> 01:07:05.275
scattered stuff underneath the hole in the--

01:07:05.275 --> 01:07:07.947
MATT: Signs of individuals dropping down from above.

01:07:07.947 --> 01:07:09.317
LIAM: Hmm.

01:07:09.317 --> 01:07:10.977
LAURA: Can we see an exit in this room?

01:07:10.977 --> 01:07:12.587
Any kind of cracks, like there was

01:07:12.587 --> 01:07:14.857
in that stone that we all saw?

01:07:14.857 --> 01:07:16.327
MATT: Right, if you'd like to follow up,

01:07:16.327 --> 01:07:17.857
make a perception check as well.

01:07:17.857 --> 01:07:19.981
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll assist you.

01:07:19.981 --> 01:07:21.797
LAURA: Guidance!

01:07:21.797 --> 01:07:22.891
Whoa.
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:07:22.891 --> 01:07:24.133
LAURA: Oh! Natural 20!

01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:25.502
MATT: Nice!
TALIESIN: Never mind, we're good.

01:07:25.502 --> 01:07:26.335
LIAM: Guidance.

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:28.267
MATT: Glancing around,

01:07:28.267 --> 01:07:30.817
you don't yet see

01:07:30.817 --> 01:07:34.627
another opening, crack, tunnel.

01:07:34.627 --> 01:07:37.287
This chamber seems to be, through its collapse,

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:39.533
for the most part, locked off.

01:07:40.597 --> 01:07:43.197
But you do catch that same kind of striated bunches

01:07:43.197 --> 01:07:45.317
beneath the ice in the corners.

01:07:45.317 --> 01:07:49.895
And it reminds you of finely-wound silk.

01:07:50.937 --> 01:07:55.067
And you look past some of the tall stalagmites,

01:07:55.067 --> 01:07:58.857
some clear, some clouded with imperfections

01:07:58.857 --> 01:08:00.048
in the moisture that have gathered

01:08:00.048 --> 01:08:02.987
with other elements that may have been brought forth

01:08:02.987 --> 01:08:05.687
or just gradually dripped through the ceiling

01:08:05.687 --> 01:08:08.154
with the water that gathered and froze over.

01:08:10.647 --> 01:08:14.337
And you see, some look almost like they're attached

01:08:14.337 --> 01:08:16.390
at odd angles.

01:08:17.677 --> 01:08:20.260
Like tall, angled limbs.

01:08:21.527 --> 01:08:22.487
LAURA: Ice spiders?

01:08:22.487 --> 01:08:25.757
MATT: And you see a,

01:08:25.757 --> 01:08:29.367
up until this point, very well hidden,

01:08:29.367 --> 01:08:33.457
mostly translucent and white arachnid beast.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:36.037
About 12 feet from side to side.

01:08:36.037 --> 01:08:36.870
TRAVIS: What?!

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:38.167
LIAM: 12?!

01:08:38.167 --> 01:08:39.480
ASHLEY: Under the ice, or...

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.820
LAURA: Or out, just hiding on the ice?

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:44.477
MATT: Just clustered in between all the stalagmites

01:08:44.477 --> 01:08:45.418
in the corner.

01:08:45.418 --> 01:08:46.790
LIAM: We're in the hive. We're in the nest.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:50.415
LAURA: We're in the spider nest!
MARISHA: Just watching us?

01:08:50.415 --> 01:08:51.406
MATT: Just watching.
LIAM: Yeah,

01:08:51.406 --> 01:08:53.027
it wasn't people jumping down from here.

01:08:53.027 --> 01:08:54.924
MARISHA: Yeah, it was spiders. Should we go?

01:08:54.924 --> 01:08:56.987
TALIESIN: Make our way out?
MARISHA: We should go, right?

01:08:56.987 --> 01:08:58.577
TRAVIS: Just pretend like you didn't see it.

01:08:58.577 --> 01:09:01.177
Just pretend and just, no, there's nothing in here,

01:09:01.177 --> 01:09:02.341
perhaps we should...
LAURA: Do you see there any openings

01:09:02.341 --> 01:09:04.900
in here or should we maybe just get out of here?

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.767
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't want to fight this thing in here,

01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:08.337
so why don't we move really fast

01:09:08.337 --> 01:09:09.512
so we can fight it down there?

01:09:09.512 --> 01:09:12.157
LAURA: Go. Go, go, go.
MARISHA: Go, go, go, we go down.

01:09:12.157 --> 01:09:14.247
MATT: One by one, you all begin to descend the rope.

01:09:14.247 --> 01:09:16.087
LAURA: I'll go last so I can--

01:09:16.087 --> 01:09:16.920
no, what am I doing?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.007
Beau, go last so you can jump.
MARISHA: I'll go last.

01:09:20.007 --> 01:09:22.357
MATT: Okay, so all begin rushing down.

01:09:22.357 --> 01:09:23.897
You keep an eye over at it.

01:09:23.897 --> 01:09:26.057
Doesn't appear to be moving or reacting to any of you.

01:09:26.057 --> 01:09:27.807
MARISHA: Just staring at it the whole time.

01:09:27.807 --> 01:09:29.707
Untie the rope.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:30.990
Jump down.
MATT: Okay.

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:33.521
TALIESIN: Is there a way to seal that off?

01:09:33.521 --> 01:09:36.617
LAURA: I have Stone Shape prepared.

01:09:36.617 --> 01:09:39.344
I could try to do that?

01:09:40.365 --> 01:09:41.677
TALIESIN: It's not a bad idea.
SAM: Or just keep going

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:43.598
through the other door.

01:09:43.598 --> 01:09:44.799
TALIESIN: There is no other door up there.

01:09:44.799 --> 01:09:46.577
ASHLEY: It didn't come after us.
MARISHA: Yeah, why didn't it

01:09:46.577 --> 01:09:48.467
come after us?
ASHLEY: That was weird.

01:09:48.467 --> 01:09:49.300
SAM: What's wrong with us?

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:51.994
LAURA: Did it look like it was looking at us?

01:09:51.994 --> 01:09:54.577
MATT: You watched it for the time that you noticed it,

01:09:54.577 --> 01:09:55.677
and before the fear,

01:09:55.677 --> 01:09:59.968
it didn't seem to react or move.

01:09:59.968 --> 01:10:02.637
It was just facing loosely your direction,

01:10:02.637 --> 01:10:04.303
hunched there in the back corner.

01:10:04.303 --> 01:10:06.043
TRAVIS: Still?
ASHLEY: Was it alive?

01:10:06.043 --> 01:10:07.668
MATT: It didn't move.

01:10:09.195 --> 01:10:14.195
LIAM: Maybe it was some sort of ice automaton, or

01:10:14.207 --> 01:10:17.807
maybe it was not-- maybe it was dormant.

01:10:17.807 --> 01:10:19.737
SAM: Maybe it doesn't eat things

01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.737
unless they fall into its web?

01:10:21.737 --> 01:10:23.637
MARISHA: We saw those striations

01:10:23.637 --> 01:10:28.077
on other icicles other than just up there, correct?

01:10:28.077 --> 01:10:29.690
MATT: No, that was the first you've seen.

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.303
MARISHA: That was the first we'd seen, okay.

01:10:31.303 --> 01:10:33.857
TRAVIS: Well, we haven't seen a web, right? No webs?

01:10:33.857 --> 01:10:35.330
LIAM: No.
LAURA: Just frozen webs.

01:10:37.204 --> 01:10:38.627
TRAVIS: Have we seen frozen webs?

01:10:38.627 --> 01:10:41.037
LAURA: That's what those things were.

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:43.517
MARISHA: Frozen egg sacs, maybe?

01:10:43.517 --> 01:10:44.508
LAURA: Tightly wound--

01:10:44.508 --> 01:10:45.500
TRAVIS: Silk. Right.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:49.017
LAURA: But, like, it seemed like some of the ice--

01:10:49.017 --> 01:10:50.917
oh no, the icicles, the bent icicles

01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:51.942
were the limbs of--

01:10:51.942 --> 01:10:53.423
MATT: Were the limbs of the spider.

01:10:54.507 --> 01:10:55.417
TALIESIN: Well...

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.527
MARISHA: Why you didn't it come after us?

01:10:57.527 --> 01:10:58.360
LAURA: Maybe it was nice.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.027
Maybe it was friendly and just lonely.

01:11:00.027 --> 01:11:02.587
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe we just didn't attack it, so it's fine.

01:11:02.587 --> 01:11:04.567
ASHLEY: Yeah, but it wasn't moving.

01:11:04.567 --> 01:11:06.167
TRAVIS: Let's check out the other room!

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:08.167
MARISHA: Yeah!
SAM: (laughs)

01:11:08.167 --> 01:11:09.000
MARISHA: Let's do that.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.897
LIAM: With eyes on our six.

01:11:10.897 --> 01:11:12.407
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:11:12.407 --> 01:11:14.317
SAM: Yeah. Eyes--

01:11:14.317 --> 01:11:17.077
MARISHA: In fact, I'm just going to walk backwards

01:11:17.077 --> 01:11:18.677
while we walk in that direction.

01:11:18.677 --> 01:11:20.894
MATT: Okay, keeping an eye up there.

01:11:20.894 --> 01:11:22.217
MARISHA: See if it follows.

01:11:22.217 --> 01:11:23.050
MATT: Okay.

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:25.017
So keeping an eye out, you all make your way

01:11:25.017 --> 01:11:26.907
towards the other exit of the chamber,

01:11:26.907 --> 01:11:29.712
where you had previously looked before. Okay.

01:11:29.712 --> 01:11:31.085
LAURA: You think I should seal it?

01:11:32.277 --> 01:11:33.110
TALIESIN: Be prepared to--

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:34.517
SAM: Feel it?
TALIESIN: Seal something.

01:11:34.517 --> 01:11:35.370
SAM: Oh, seal it.

01:11:37.962 --> 01:11:40.351
TRAVIS: 12 feet across? (laughs)

01:11:40.351 --> 01:11:41.184
ASHLEY: That's a big boy.

01:11:41.184 --> 01:11:42.767
TRAVIS: That's a big boy! (laughs)

01:11:42.767 --> 01:11:43.600
ASHLEY: Big boy!

01:11:44.757 --> 01:11:46.750
SAM: I guess we'll go into the other chamber?

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:47.967
TRAVIS: Wait, should we seal it?

01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:49.175
Can you just seal it that easy,

01:11:49.175 --> 01:11:50.307
40 feet in the air?
LAURA: I don't know, let me look.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:52.497
I don't use this spell very often.

01:11:52.497 --> 01:11:53.657
TRAVIS: Yeah, take a quick gander

01:11:53.657 --> 01:11:56.947
because that could be, you know, smart.

01:11:56.947 --> 01:11:59.467
SAM: I'll climb into the other chamber while she's sealing.

01:11:59.467 --> 01:12:02.037
TRAVIS: You get snatched by another fucking one!

01:12:02.037 --> 01:12:05.973
TALIESIN: Is the doorway big enough
for the spider to get out of?

01:12:07.367 --> 01:12:08.857
MATT: You didn't get quite a look

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.787
at the entire spider's body.

01:12:10.787 --> 01:12:11.647
It's possible.

01:12:11.647 --> 01:12:12.605
LAURA: Probably.

01:12:12.605 --> 01:12:14.124
Spiders can crawl through little spots.

01:12:14.124 --> 01:12:14.957
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair.

01:12:14.957 --> 01:12:16.787
MARISHA: Yeah, they can get weird their legs.

01:12:17.635 --> 01:12:19.389
TRAVIS: What does it say?
MARISHA: You know?

01:12:19.389 --> 01:12:21.037
LAURA: I have to touch it.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:23.027
TRAVIS: Have to touch the stone?
LAURA: So I'd have to get up there

01:12:23.027 --> 01:12:25.849
and touch it in order to shape the stone.

01:12:25.849 --> 01:12:28.967
TRAVIS: And then what happens, can you close off a doorway?

01:12:28.967 --> 01:12:30.734
Like an archway?

01:12:30.734 --> 01:12:33.137
LAURA: I can touch a stone

01:12:33.137 --> 01:12:36.341
no more than five feet in any dimension

01:12:36.341 --> 01:12:39.817
and form it into any shape that suits my purpose.

01:12:39.817 --> 01:12:41.117
TRAVIS: Five feet in any dimension?

01:12:41.117 --> 01:12:43.317
LAURA: Five feet in any dimension, so,

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:44.927
I could...

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:48.137
TRAVIS: The archway is like, two people wide?

01:12:48.137 --> 01:12:50.107
LAURA: No. Was it that big?

01:12:50.107 --> 01:12:51.527
MATT: The archway was about...

01:12:53.505 --> 01:12:56.407
I'd say about eight-foot tall, its actual size

01:12:56.407 --> 01:12:59.067
and about six feet wide, so it'd be about the size

01:12:59.067 --> 01:13:01.159
to let comfortably a person or two people

01:13:01.159 --> 01:13:02.767
walk through it, yeah.
LAURA: So I could seal it

01:13:02.767 --> 01:13:06.157
to where there was only a foot of space in the doorway?

01:13:06.157 --> 01:13:06.990
MATT: Yeah.

01:13:08.237 --> 01:13:09.837
LAURA: I mean, it might be able to fit through still,

01:13:09.837 --> 01:13:11.047
I don't know.

01:13:11.047 --> 01:13:13.458
TRAVIS: Does it cost a valuable spell for you?

01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:15.030
LAURA: It's a spell.

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.987
TRAVIS: Huh?
LAURA: It's a spell,

01:13:15.987 --> 01:13:16.820
but I can try it.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.967
But I have to be up 40 feet in the--

01:13:18.967 --> 01:13:21.276
I can't get up there!
TRAVIS: What level spell?

01:13:21.276 --> 01:13:23.481
LAURA: Fourth.
TRAVIS: I cast Fly on you.

01:13:23.481 --> 01:13:25.286
LAURA: But now you used a spell, Fjord!

01:13:25.286 --> 01:13:26.473
TRAVIS: (noncommittal noise)

01:13:26.473 --> 01:13:28.707
LAURA: (distressed noise) I fly up.

01:13:28.707 --> 01:13:31.947
MATT: So, Jester, you now, for the-- how long does it last?

01:13:31.947 --> 01:13:32.837
TRAVIS: 10 minutes.

01:13:32.837 --> 01:13:34.605
MATT: 10 minutes you can fly.

01:13:34.605 --> 01:13:36.117
As long as he maintains concentration.

01:13:36.117 --> 01:13:38.177
TRAVIS: Yeah. The sword pulses.

01:13:38.177 --> 01:13:39.480
And you go up.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.477
LAURA: Thanks, Fjord!

01:13:40.477 --> 01:13:43.279
MATT: Without issue, you float up to the entrance

01:13:43.279 --> 01:13:45.787
and, what faint, since the light has been removed,

01:13:45.787 --> 01:13:48.267
it's just a dark lightless interior

01:13:48.267 --> 01:13:51.290
of the upper chamber.
LAURA: Can I have some globules?

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:53.093
LIAM: Do you want some? Yeah.

01:13:53.093 --> 01:13:55.289
I send up two.
LAURA: Okay.

01:13:55.289 --> 01:13:56.907
I'm going to touch the side of the doorway,

01:13:56.907 --> 01:13:59.937
so I can shape it and try to block off the doorway

01:13:59.937 --> 01:14:00.987
as much as possible.

01:14:00.987 --> 01:14:03.667
MATT: Okay, you begin to press against it

01:14:03.667 --> 01:14:06.127
with your hand, much like it's wettened clay.

01:14:06.127 --> 01:14:09.817
You watch as this detailed ceiling,

01:14:09.817 --> 01:14:12.550
this extremely carefully carved,

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:16.957
artistic, Aeorian wall

01:14:16.957 --> 01:14:20.627
becomes shaped like a kindergartner's mug they made

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:22.585
for their adult.
LIAM: Papier-mâché.

01:14:22.585 --> 01:14:26.307
MATT: To cover the majority of this entrance.

01:14:26.307 --> 01:14:28.727
But functionally, seems to be blocking the majority of it.

01:14:28.727 --> 01:14:30.207
TRAVIS: You're talking nicely to the spider

01:14:30.207 --> 01:14:31.167
while you're doing this?

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.678
LAURA: Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Stay in there.

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:38.678
(to the tune of Brahms' "Lullaby")
♪ Go to sleep, little spider ♪

01:14:38.784 --> 01:14:42.073
♪ Don't come and attack us! ♪

01:14:42.073 --> 01:14:44.377
(laughter)

01:14:44.377 --> 01:14:45.997
MATT: All right. Once you complete that--

01:14:45.997 --> 01:14:47.997
LAURA: I just keep, I just fly around

01:14:47.997 --> 01:14:49.986
as long as I can.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.927
LIAM: In the time that she's taking to do that,

01:14:51.927 --> 01:14:54.387
I ask Yasha for a hand up into the doorway,

01:14:54.387 --> 01:14:57.047
the other doorway that's like 10 feet up.

01:14:57.047 --> 01:15:00.177
And if she hoists me up, I'm going to try

01:15:00.177 --> 01:15:02.287
to climb myself up into that area.

01:15:02.287 --> 01:15:03.120
MATT: Okay.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.309
LIAM: And ritually cast Alarm.

01:15:05.309 --> 01:15:07.819
I'm going to pull silver thread

01:15:08.767 --> 01:15:10.363
along the length of it

01:15:10.363 --> 01:15:12.165
so that I can know if anything is coming behind us.

01:15:12.165 --> 01:15:12.998
MATT: You got it.

01:15:12.998 --> 01:15:14.117
And Veth, you've already climbed

01:15:14.117 --> 01:15:15.787
your way up there, you said?

01:15:15.787 --> 01:15:17.947
SAM: I don't know which door he's talking about.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:18.847
MATT: The only other door.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:20.877
MARISHA: The floor ceiling door.

01:15:20.877 --> 01:15:22.597
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

01:15:22.597 --> 01:15:24.730
Yeah. That's the one I'm going into.

01:15:25.949 --> 01:15:28.667
MATT: Technically, it's the floor wall door, but yeah.

01:15:28.667 --> 01:15:29.575
MARISHA: Semantics.

01:15:29.575 --> 01:15:30.817
(laughter)

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:33.087
MATT: No, it's actual layout.

01:15:33.087 --> 01:15:34.197
MARISHA: Whatever.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:35.844
SAM: Agree to disagree.

01:15:35.844 --> 01:15:37.667
(laughter)

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:38.877
TALIESIN: Potato, potahto.

01:15:38.877 --> 01:15:40.870
LIAM: Guys, we broke the fourth wall years ago.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.037
(groaning)

01:15:43.037 --> 01:15:43.987
TALIESIN: Boo.

01:15:43.987 --> 01:15:45.024
SAM: Get out!

01:15:45.024 --> 01:15:46.837
(laughter)

01:15:46.837 --> 01:15:47.769
LIAM: All right, I will.

01:15:47.769 --> 01:15:49.185
(laughter)

01:15:49.185 --> 01:15:50.927
SAM: Oh no, he's leaving!
LAURA: No!

01:15:50.927 --> 01:15:53.834
SAM: I have that kind of power? Wow!

01:15:53.834 --> 01:15:55.415
MATT: Do not empower him. It's too much to give him.

01:15:55.415 --> 01:15:56.807
SAM: Marisha, get out!

01:15:56.807 --> 01:15:58.007
TRAVIS: He's like, I have to pee anyway.

01:15:58.007 --> 01:16:00.149
MARISHA: No.
SAM: Oh. It doesn't work.

01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:02.975
MARISHA: No, it doesn't! (laughs)

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:04.142
MATT: All righty, so.

01:16:05.637 --> 01:16:07.148
He's-- okay.

01:16:07.148 --> 01:16:09.518
MARISHA: Taking the opportunity to go pee, I think.

01:16:09.518 --> 01:16:12.557
MATT: I respect that, I respect that.

01:16:12.557 --> 01:16:14.857
So, Veth, you're the first to climb in there,

01:16:14.857 --> 01:16:17.357
the little bit of light that's beginning to peek inward.

01:16:17.357 --> 01:16:19.477
You get up over this entryway

01:16:19.477 --> 01:16:21.147
and you see that hall where it's broken

01:16:21.147 --> 01:16:22.427
and shifted to the side.

01:16:22.427 --> 01:16:24.847
It's now this triangular-shaped space

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:26.977
that you would have to peer through and step.

01:16:26.977 --> 01:16:28.077
And as you get to that point,

01:16:28.077 --> 01:16:31.447
you can see where the jagged stone meeting part itself

01:16:31.447 --> 01:16:33.397
has been disjointed and shifted to the side.

01:16:33.397 --> 01:16:35.797
But it is still large enough for a person to go through.

01:16:35.797 --> 01:16:39.060
Roughly one, maybe two small figures at a time.

01:16:40.437 --> 01:16:42.253
MARISHA: So not a Caduceus size?

01:16:42.253 --> 01:16:43.497
TALIESIN: One Caduceus.
MATT: One Caduceus.

01:16:43.497 --> 01:16:45.497
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to float down

01:16:45.497 --> 01:16:48.760
with my ability to fly and land softly,

01:16:49.607 --> 01:16:51.393
next to Veth.

01:16:52.627 --> 01:16:54.107
And then I'll lean over the side

01:16:54.107 --> 01:16:56.242
and try to hoist everybody else up.

01:16:56.242 --> 01:16:57.857
MATT: Okay.

01:16:57.857 --> 01:16:59.907
You all eventually make your way back up

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:04.210
into this odd joint portion of the hall.

01:17:05.407 --> 01:17:06.657
Looking into the next chamber,

01:17:06.657 --> 01:17:09.117
the one that Caleb had already seen once,

01:17:09.117 --> 01:17:12.987
the decline is steeper than his perspective

01:17:12.987 --> 01:17:14.287
allowed him to really see.

01:17:15.497 --> 01:17:20.477
It's probably not quite a 45 degree angle downward,

01:17:20.477 --> 01:17:23.227
but it's pushing about 35.

01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:25.087
MARISHA: And it's smooth? It's like a hall?

01:17:25.087 --> 01:17:26.557
MATT: No, it's not smooth.

01:17:26.557 --> 01:17:27.977
Elements of it are smoother than others

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.527
and there are some where you can see

01:17:29.527 --> 01:17:31.407
rocky shapes that have ice sheets over it

01:17:31.407 --> 01:17:32.295
that are fairly smooth,

01:17:32.295 --> 01:17:34.397
but some of it's broken rock, too, and broken ice.

01:17:34.397 --> 01:17:36.477
But regardless, it is slick

01:17:36.477 --> 01:17:37.547
and it is precarious.

01:17:37.547 --> 01:17:38.937
MARISHA: We don't want to hit anything

01:17:38.937 --> 01:17:41.297
as we potentially slide out of control.

01:17:41.297 --> 01:17:43.117
TALIESIN: Grab the rope, and I hand it to Jester.

01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:44.617
TRAVIS: Yeah. She can fly through it.

01:17:44.617 --> 01:17:46.086
MARISHA: Perfect.

01:17:46.086 --> 01:17:49.825
LAURA: Ooh, yes. Do I still
have the ability to fly? Probably.

01:17:49.825 --> 01:17:52.127
TRAVIS: 10 minutes, yeah. Make good use of it.

01:17:52.127 --> 01:17:53.265
LAURA: Right?
MATT: Yeah, you have

01:17:53.265 --> 01:17:54.917
maybe a couple more minutes of it left, yeah.

01:17:54.917 --> 01:17:56.487
LAURA: Okay, I'll lift up

01:17:56.487 --> 01:17:59.290
and fly down,

01:18:00.347 --> 01:18:02.217
and land at the bottom.

01:18:02.217 --> 01:18:03.375
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Is there anything

01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:05.027
to hook the rope onto

01:18:05.027 --> 01:18:06.760
or is it just me holding onto it?

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:10.257
MATT: It's just you holding onto it at the moment.

01:18:10.257 --> 01:18:12.340
The room is freezing cold.

01:18:13.487 --> 01:18:15.327
The temperature significantly dropped

01:18:15.327 --> 01:18:18.117
when you stepped through the threshold.

01:18:18.117 --> 01:18:19.847
And now looking inside this chamber,

01:18:19.847 --> 01:18:23.177
as you fly through with the light granted by Caleb's orbs,

01:18:23.177 --> 01:18:25.497
you can see it's beautiful.

01:18:25.497 --> 01:18:27.577
The ice crystals refract the light

01:18:27.577 --> 01:18:30.767
in hundreds of thousands of different facets,

01:18:30.767 --> 01:18:32.754
like a room of diamonds surrounding you.

01:18:32.754 --> 01:18:34.707
And as you coast through holding the rope,

01:18:34.707 --> 01:18:35.540
you get to the opposite side.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.587
How long is the rope that was given?

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:37.420
50 feet?
TRAVIS: 50.

01:18:38.407 --> 01:18:40.917
MATT: You cannot get to the-- the rope is not long enough

01:18:40.917 --> 01:18:42.083
to reach the other side of the chamber.
TALIESIN: Do we have a second

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:43.541
to double up the rope?
MARISHA: Yeah, I do.

01:18:43.541 --> 01:18:45.457
Here. I pull out my rope.

01:18:45.457 --> 01:18:47.614
Toss it Caduceus so he can tie the end.

01:18:47.614 --> 01:18:49.897
TALIESIN: Knot, and a knot, and a knot, and should, yeah.

01:18:49.897 --> 01:18:51.147
MATT: That puts you at your final minute

01:18:51.147 --> 01:18:53.117
of your Fly, just so you know.
LAURA: Okay.

01:18:53.117 --> 01:18:55.527
MATT: But you head back, fly to the opposite side

01:18:55.527 --> 01:18:56.877
and you see there are the double doors.

01:18:56.877 --> 01:18:58.377
And as you get there,

01:18:58.377 --> 01:19:00.080
there's no handle.

01:19:01.077 --> 01:19:04.557
There's no knob, there's nothing to grab the doors with.

01:19:04.557 --> 01:19:06.007
They're just there.

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:07.892
And you can see a thick sheet of ice

01:19:07.892 --> 01:19:10.238
that has slowly built around the edges of them

01:19:10.238 --> 01:19:11.297
that fill the gaps

01:19:11.297 --> 01:19:13.397
from where the rest of the stone walls

01:19:13.397 --> 01:19:15.797
currently would meet with this door.

01:19:15.797 --> 01:19:19.197
LAURA: I'm going to pull my little mittens up over my hands

01:19:19.197 --> 01:19:20.870
and touch the doorway.

01:19:21.717 --> 01:19:24.592
Does it feel like there's anything?

01:19:24.592 --> 01:19:26.227
Like, is it safe to lean on

01:19:26.227 --> 01:19:27.797
and brace myself against the door?

01:19:27.797 --> 01:19:29.005
Like, it's just a wall?

01:19:29.005 --> 01:19:30.857
MATT: You touch it and it's very cold,

01:19:30.857 --> 01:19:35.129
but it doesn't react in any unexpected way.

01:19:35.129 --> 01:19:36.777
LAURA: All right, I'm just going to stand here

01:19:36.777 --> 01:19:39.447
and brace on the wall and hold the rope as tight as I can

01:19:39.447 --> 01:19:42.597
for everybody so they can descend

01:19:42.597 --> 01:19:44.367
as slowly as possible.

01:19:44.367 --> 01:19:45.917
MATT: Okay. Who's going first?

01:19:45.917 --> 01:19:47.597
MARISHA: Before we descend,

01:19:47.597 --> 01:19:50.847
can I get to the threshold of this door that we're in?

01:19:50.847 --> 01:19:53.387
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: Kind of step out into the main chamber

01:19:53.387 --> 01:19:55.067
and step back in.

01:19:55.067 --> 01:19:59.500
Is the temperature difference noticeable by the threshold?

01:20:01.447 --> 01:20:04.007
MATT: It's not like you're stepping into another room

01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:06.130
and it immediately shifts. It's gradual

01:20:07.297 --> 01:20:08.605
in that little in-between area,

01:20:08.605 --> 01:20:10.030
but it is noticeable.
MARISHA: Okay, so no serious drop.

01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:11.954
SAM: It's like when you step into the

01:20:11.954 --> 01:20:13.647
frozen room at Costco,

01:20:13.647 --> 01:20:15.824
like where they keep the milk?
MATT: Yeah.

01:20:15.824 --> 01:20:16.657
Like that.

01:20:16.657 --> 01:20:18.467
MARISHA: Like the ice spa, Wi spa?

01:20:18.467 --> 01:20:19.450
The ice room?

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:20.737
LIAM: I'll slide down the rope.

01:20:21.937 --> 01:20:22.770
MATT: Okay.

01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:23.603
LAURA: It's really beautiful.

01:20:23.603 --> 01:20:25.557
MATT: So it is who going down the rope, then?

01:20:25.557 --> 01:20:26.926
If we already had-
SAM: Caleb.

01:20:26.926 --> 01:20:29.097
LIAM: Caleb.
TRAVIS: Do we need to set a thread

01:20:29.097 --> 01:20:31.347
in case ice spider finds a way?

01:20:31.347 --> 01:20:32.663
LAURA: He did, Caleb said that.
LIAM: I did that.

01:20:32.663 --> 01:20:33.504
SAM: That spider's sealed up.

01:20:33.504 --> 01:20:34.737
MATT: Are you going one at a time

01:20:34.737 --> 01:20:37.940
or are you guys going with a distance between each other?

01:20:39.014 --> 01:20:40.823
TALIESIN: I think one at a time will be the way to go.
MARISHA: I think so, too.

01:20:40.823 --> 01:20:41.867
LAURA: Yeah, plus I'm holding it,

01:20:41.867 --> 01:20:44.457
so I don't know if I can support more than one person.

01:20:44.457 --> 01:20:46.047
MATT: So Caleb makes his way down--

01:20:46.047 --> 01:20:48.247
MARISHA: It's like water-slide rules.
MATT: -- to the base. Who's next?

01:20:48.247 --> 01:20:49.355
MARISHA: One kid at a time.

01:20:49.355 --> 01:20:50.877
TALIESIN: I'll go next.

01:20:50.877 --> 01:20:52.562
MATT: Okay.

01:20:52.562 --> 01:20:53.562
Caduceus steps down.

01:20:54.407 --> 01:20:57.667
About halfway down the rope,

01:20:57.667 --> 01:21:00.317
the temperature noticeably gets even colder.

01:21:00.317 --> 01:21:02.757
You find your teeth

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:04.957
chittering against your jaw.

01:21:04.957 --> 01:21:09.567
And you feel this numbness

01:21:09.567 --> 01:21:11.517
beginning to hit the outside of your skin

01:21:11.517 --> 01:21:13.867
by just the sheer drop in temperature.

01:21:13.867 --> 01:21:17.927
You, because you have a very high passive perception,

01:21:17.927 --> 01:21:21.307
glance around and from the cavalcade

01:21:21.307 --> 01:21:23.667
of teeth-like icicles above you,

01:21:23.667 --> 01:21:27.620
you see this strange, pulsing, faint blue light

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:32.167
that has a number of crystal-like ice protrusions,

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:33.767
just floating around it.

01:21:33.767 --> 01:21:37.147
Like a small orb of jagged jewelry

01:21:37.147 --> 01:21:38.987
just hovering towards you

01:21:38.987 --> 01:21:40.460
with this faint mist

01:21:41.317 --> 01:21:42.557
drifting off of it.
TALIESIN: That's a thing.

01:21:42.557 --> 01:21:45.057
That's a thing, there's a thing, and, wow,

01:21:45.057 --> 01:21:46.337
this is-- oh, yeah.

01:21:46.337 --> 01:21:48.987
MATT: You guys hear him say this and look up and you see,

01:21:50.257 --> 01:21:51.707
maybe a half dozen or more of these,

01:21:51.707 --> 01:21:53.570
all descending from the ceiling towards Caduceus.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:55.052
MARISHA: Oh, they're all coming towards us?

01:21:55.052 --> 01:21:56.327
Oh, I think they're elementals!

01:21:56.327 --> 01:21:58.467
Oh, I think they're ice elementals.

01:21:58.467 --> 01:22:00.011
MATT: Let's go ahead and get out the battle map.

01:22:00.011 --> 01:22:01.124
ASHLEY: Oh no!

01:22:01.124 --> 01:22:02.888
SAM: Oh, god, what's happening?
LIAM: Oh no!

01:22:02.888 --> 01:22:04.221
We're being attacked.
LAURA: Oh, and it's like an incline,

01:22:04.221 --> 01:22:05.214
so you can't stand on it.
SAM: I don't know what's happening,

01:22:05.214 --> 01:22:06.117
but whatever it is,

01:22:06.117 --> 01:22:08.457
is sponsored by Dwarven Forge's

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.087

LAURA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: Oh we got a slab going on!

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:19.594
ASHLEY: Oh, god!
LAURA: Oh, this is so cool!

01:22:19.594 --> 01:22:20.927
SAM: A raked stage?

01:22:22.249 --> 01:22:23.410
I love it.
MARISHA: It is totally

01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:24.510
a raked stage.
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:22:25.927 --> 01:22:28.567
MARISHA: Aw, this means we can call downstage and upstage.

01:22:28.567 --> 01:22:30.232
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:30.232 --> 01:22:31.300
MATT: Now the rest of you are all up here.

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:34.710
TRAVIS: Or we could, if we were stupid enough.

01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:36.207
SAM: Ashley, get out of there.

01:22:36.207 --> 01:22:38.017
Get out!
TRAVIS: I'm going to be downstage.

01:22:38.017 --> 01:22:39.547
Downstage right.

01:22:39.547 --> 01:22:40.457
ASHLEY: Got to figure out our order.

01:22:40.457 --> 01:22:42.907
MARISHA: Can I please enter stage left?

01:22:42.907 --> 01:22:44.507
It's closer to my dressing room.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.954
LIAM: And I, Medea!

01:22:47.954 --> 01:22:49.373
(laughter)

01:22:49.373 --> 01:22:50.627
MATT: Oh my god.

01:22:50.627 --> 01:22:52.827
SAM: I love your movies, Tyler Perry movies.

01:22:52.827 --> 01:22:55.079
TALIESIN: Why did I not know this? Of course!

01:22:55.079 --> 01:22:56.397
MATT: Okay.

01:22:56.397 --> 01:22:58.887
So, I don't have a piece of cord I was going to use

01:22:58.887 --> 01:23:01.410
to set the rope-like protrusion here.

01:23:02.487 --> 01:23:05.722
What I can do is use this power cord--

01:23:05.722 --> 01:23:08.167
LAURA: What?
MATT: -- to make it work. Why not?

01:23:08.167 --> 01:23:09.217
Little iPad cord.

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:11.887
SAM: But won't your iPad die?
MATT: Nope, it's good.

01:23:13.177 --> 01:23:14.278
There we go.

01:23:14.278 --> 01:23:16.427
(laughter)

01:23:16.427 --> 01:23:17.260
Mostly works!

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:19.890
SAM: Amazing map, and an iPhone charger.

01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:21.477
(laughter)

01:23:21.477 --> 01:23:22.527
MATT: I didn't know you guys were going to be putting a rope

01:23:22.527 --> 01:23:23.418
through here when I set it up.

01:23:23.418 --> 01:23:25.051
It's fine.
SAM: I love it.

01:23:26.476 --> 01:23:28.477
TALIESIN: Are those cauldrons?

01:23:28.477 --> 01:23:31.319
MARISHA: He mentioned there being braziers.
LAURA: I thought it was a narrower--

01:23:31.319 --> 01:23:32.357
I thought it was like a hallway.

01:23:32.357 --> 01:23:34.553
I didn't realize it was a full room.

01:23:35.704 --> 01:23:38.220
MATT: Keep the sides. So.

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.257
If I could have everyone roll initiative, please.

01:23:39.257 --> 01:23:40.915
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Yeah, braziers.

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:43.520
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:23:44.894 --> 01:23:46.677
LIAM: Yep.
MARISHA: Son of a bitch...

01:23:52.497 --> 01:23:54.817

01:23:54.817 --> 01:23:56.008
LAURA: 20.

01:23:56.008 --> 01:23:57.955

01:24:38.391 --> 01:24:40.512
MATT: So, you see about...

01:24:42.197 --> 01:24:43.817
half a dozen of these entities

01:24:43.817 --> 01:24:45.377
floating down towards Caduceus.

01:24:45.377 --> 01:24:46.797

01:24:46.797 --> 01:24:47.989
LAURA: Geez, look.

01:24:47.989 --> 01:24:50.570

TRAVIS: It's fine. It's fine.

01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:52.317
LAURA: Oh, cool, though!
MATT: And you see numerous

01:24:52.317 --> 01:24:54.007
other ones floating above. I'll go ahead

01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:57.057
and get a few placement markings here,

01:24:57.057 --> 01:24:58.782
so you can see where they are.

01:25:00.497 --> 01:25:02.217

LIAM: How high is the ceiling

01:25:02.217 --> 01:25:03.050
from the floor?

01:25:04.097 --> 01:25:05.907
MATT: It's roughly 20 or so feet.

01:25:05.907 --> 01:25:07.377

at some point in time, somewhere in the world.

01:25:31.952 --> 01:25:35.077

01:25:35.077 --> 01:25:36.135
LAURA: Okay.

01:25:38.607 --> 01:25:41.500
Since I'm stuck at the base,

01:25:44.577 --> 01:25:48.837
I'm going to Invoke Duplicity as my action.

01:25:48.837 --> 01:25:50.227
MATT: All righty. Where are you placing her?

01:25:50.227 --> 01:25:54.254

MARISHA: Should we light

01:30:02.923 --> 01:30:05.407
you feel the heat in your body being siphoned out.

01:30:05.407 --> 01:30:07.167
The cold beginning to oppress you

01:30:07.167 --> 01:30:08.897
and already at the edges of your face,

01:30:08.897 --> 01:30:11.007
at your eyes, any point of moisture in your body,

01:30:11.007 --> 01:30:13.477
you can them beginning to freeze

01:30:13.477 --> 01:30:16.597

25.

TALIESIN: Weird question, if one of them missed,

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:49.007
would I be able to bounce it off the shield?

01:30:49.007 --> 01:30:50.717
MATT: You would've. These are attacks on you.

01:30:50.717 --> 01:30:52.957
TALIESIN: Oh, is it okay to do that, then?

01:30:52.957 --> 01:30:54.247
I know that I should've called that.

01:30:54.247 --> 01:30:55.080
MATT: It's still during their turn,

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.707
so we'll do that in a second. I'll resolve this.

01:30:56.707 --> 01:30:57.540
TALIESIN: Sure.

01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:59.857

01:31:03.347 --> 01:31:05.347
26 points of cold damage, reduced to 13.

01:31:06.187 --> 01:31:08.427
TRAVIS: Wow. 26?

01:31:08.427 --> 01:31:11.267
Are these considered melee hits or spell attacks?

01:31:11.267 --> 01:31:13.390
MATT: They're considered attacks.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:15.007
MATT: There's something about their essence

01:31:15.007 --> 01:31:18.477
that reaches out to you and draws the heat from you.

01:31:18.477 --> 01:31:21.268
TALIESIN: It's not-- okay, it's not a melee attack.

01:31:21.268 --> 01:31:22.101
MATT: It is considered a melee attack.

01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:24.274

01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:35.697
MATT: Shield. (booms)

01:31:35.697 --> 01:31:37.497
As it tries to reach out with its energy,

01:31:37.497 --> 01:31:40.277
the shield protects it and cuts off that element

01:31:40.277 --> 01:31:43.117
of its reach, the other one is a 20, which--

01:31:43.117 --> 01:31:45.117

MATT: So you take...

01:31:50.767 --> 01:31:53.157
15 points of cold damage and your movement is halved.

01:32:02.437 --> 01:32:03.707
and hit the one that already got hit

01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:25.094
definitely takes the damage, it fails its save miserably.

TALIESIN: 20 feet back.

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:27.350

LIAM: Revenge is a dish.

LIAM: Cold!

01:32:32.927 --> 01:32:36.367

one of these elemental creatures backward.

01:32:40.407 --> 01:32:41.907
And you see it gets jammed off

01:32:41.907 --> 01:32:42.977
and then catches itself in the air

01:32:42.977 --> 01:32:45.063
and slowly the crystals begin to spin around it once more.

01:32:45.063 --> 01:32:46.171
LAURA: Is that the same one that I hit

01:32:46.171 --> 01:32:47.243
with the Spiritual Weapon?
MATT: It is.

01:32:47.243 --> 01:32:48.199
LAURA: Okay.

01:32:48.199 --> 01:32:49.849
TALIESIN: Does it look damaged at all, or?

01:32:49.849 --> 01:32:51.207
MATT: It looks damaged, yeah.

01:32:51.207 --> 01:32:54.057
That brings us now to Yasha's turn. Beau, you're on deck.

01:32:55.207 --> 01:32:56.930
TRAVIS: Dude, one of us have gone.

01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:58.587
One.
ASHLEY: So I will make my way

01:32:58.587 --> 01:33:00.747
into the room.
MARISHA: ♪ Making my way! ♪

01:33:00.747 --> 01:33:03.830
ASHLEY: How much of this do you think I have seen?

01:33:04.777 --> 01:33:06.297
Like, is the opening pretty big?

01:33:06.297 --> 01:33:07.417
MATT: You were right towards the opening here,

01:33:07.417 --> 01:33:09.577
which is about 10 feet wide-ish.

01:33:09.577 --> 01:33:11.527
And you have a clear view of all these things

01:33:11.527 --> 01:33:13.519
swarming in on Caduceus in the middle

01:33:13.519 --> 01:33:14.767
and in the distance, Caleb.

01:33:14.767 --> 01:33:16.377
You have the globules of light

01:33:16.377 --> 01:33:17.617
throughout the chamber from Caleb,

01:33:17.617 --> 01:33:20.027
so you have a clear view.

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:22.937
ASHLEY: Okay, so I will make my way in

01:33:22.937 --> 01:33:26.848
to the closest-- ♪ making my way into! ♪

♪ This cold room. It's so cold. ♪

01:33:31.877 --> 01:33:35.807
So, I'll go to the-
MARISHA: Ashley sings the classics.

01:33:35.807 --> 01:33:38.327
ASHLEY: Whichever one is closest.

01:33:38.327 --> 01:33:40.997
MATT: That'd be the one right
across you towards Caduceus there.

01:33:40.997 --> 01:33:42.727
ASHLEY: Great.
MATT: Okay.

01:33:42.727 --> 01:33:44.947
Are you going carefully for half movement?

01:33:44.947 --> 01:33:49.297
Because it is slick, or you going full bore?

01:33:49.297 --> 01:33:50.837
ASHLEY: Yeah. I mean, might as well go full bore.

01:33:50.837 --> 01:33:52.485
MATT: All right, make a
dexterity saving throw for me, please.

01:33:52.485 --> 01:33:53.833
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.
TALIESIN: Raging?

01:33:55.977 --> 01:33:57.585
ASHLEY: Yes, I am raging.

01:33:58.747 --> 01:34:01.267
MATT: So as you rage, you go running across the ice.

01:34:01.267 --> 01:34:02.287
TRAVIS: Ragé!
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:34:02.287 --> 01:34:03.527
MATT: You do have an advantage on it

01:34:03.527 --> 01:34:06.127
because you are a barbarian, so.

01:34:06.127 --> 01:34:06.960
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:34:07.867 --> 01:34:08.867
Ooh...

01:34:08.867 --> 01:34:10.173
That's a one.

01:34:11.177 --> 01:34:13.317
That's not much better.

01:34:13.317 --> 01:34:14.340
Okay, so,

01:34:16.207 --> 01:34:17.587
seven.

01:34:17.587 --> 01:34:18.587
MATT: Seven.

01:34:18.587 --> 01:34:21.216
You go raging and charging towards Caduceus

01:34:21.216 --> 01:34:24.887
and as you do, you pass an area of slick ice

01:34:24.887 --> 01:34:27.037
and your feet (whooshes) out from under you.

01:34:27.037 --> 01:34:30.133
You slam and fall prone on your back and slide.

01:34:31.647 --> 01:34:32.927
LAURA: Oh, all the way down?
MATT: All the way

01:34:32.927 --> 01:34:34.097
to bottom of the chamber.

01:34:34.097 --> 01:34:36.005
ASHLEY: Can I kick it on the way there?

01:34:36.005 --> 01:34:38.242
SAM: Can I kick it?
ASHLEY: As I land?

01:34:38.242 --> 01:34:39.075
LIAM: Yes, you can!

01:34:39.075 --> 01:34:40.366
SAM: Can I kick it?

01:34:40.366 --> 01:34:42.097
LIAM: Yes, you can!
MATT: I'll say you can take

01:34:42.097 --> 01:34:44.007
your attack on the way, if you'd like,

01:34:44.007 --> 01:34:45.200
but you're still prone.

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:49.037
You could use, I'll say about half your movement.

01:34:49.037 --> 01:34:50.437
So you would not be able to move past this

01:34:50.437 --> 01:34:52.060
if you get back up.

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:52.987
LIAM: Damn it, Yasha.

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:54.115
MATT: Or you can take the attack as you go,

01:34:54.115 --> 01:34:55.194
but it'll be at disadvantage because you're

01:34:55.194 --> 01:34:57.240
prone during the attack as you're sliding.

01:34:59.707 --> 01:35:00.540
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:35:01.488 --> 01:35:02.947
Oh, man, I want to try to get up.

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:05.037
I'm going to just, yeah, I'm going to get up.

01:35:05.037 --> 01:35:06.327
I have to get up. I have to get up.

01:35:06.327 --> 01:35:07.160
MATT: Okay.

01:35:08.087 --> 01:35:09.397
Now, as you get up,

01:35:09.397 --> 01:35:10.897
frost has gathered around you.

01:35:10.897 --> 01:35:14.710
As you tore through a number of their frozen auras.

01:35:15.826 --> 01:35:16.659
MARISHA: Oh.

01:35:17.527 --> 01:35:19.107
MATT: You take...

01:35:20.932 --> 01:35:22.516
LAURA: Uh-oh.
ASHLEY: Brr!

01:35:23.877 --> 01:35:26.047
MATT: 16 points of ice damage.

01:35:26.047 --> 01:35:28.897
As you just coast through a bunch

01:35:28.897 --> 01:35:32.827
of their freezing auras and flash frost

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:35.267
just begins to burn into your skin.

01:35:35.267 --> 01:35:36.704
But you stand up and you're there now

01:35:36.704 --> 01:35:38.429
at the bottom, right next to Caleb.

01:35:41.154 --> 01:35:45.167
Four of them.
ASHLEY: Okay, that is my turn.

01:35:45.167 --> 01:35:46.399
MATT: You can still attack.

01:35:46.399 --> 01:35:49.269
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness! That's not my turn, then.

01:35:49.269 --> 01:35:51.027
I will attack.

01:35:51.027 --> 01:35:52.197
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:35:52.197 --> 01:35:54.824
MATT: You have two right now that are swarmed around Caleb

01:35:54.824 --> 01:35:56.697
and you have access to each of them.

01:35:56.697 --> 01:35:58.627
ASHLEY: Okay, so whichever one is closest to me,

01:35:58.627 --> 01:36:02.427
which I think is the one right in front.

01:36:02.427 --> 01:36:03.609
MATT: Right there? Okay, go for it.

01:36:03.609 --> 01:36:04.467
So roll for an attack.

01:36:04.467 --> 01:36:06.607
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: Light them on fire.

01:36:06.607 --> 01:36:07.440
ASHLEY: Ooh!

01:36:08.517 --> 01:36:09.350
24.

01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:10.787
MATT: 24 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:36:10.787 --> 01:36:11.620
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:36:15.077 --> 01:36:17.620
MARISHA: I bet he's going to make lighting them an action.

01:36:22.627 --> 01:36:24.027
ASHLEY: I'm going to roll that again.

01:36:25.477 --> 01:36:27.137
Not much better.

01:36:27.137 --> 01:36:29.207
TRAVIS: Caleb, do you have the Glove of Blasting,

01:36:29.207 --> 01:36:30.040
or do I still have it?

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:30.873
LIAM: You have it.

01:36:34.147 --> 01:36:36.297
ASHLEY: 28 for the first hit.

01:36:36.297 --> 01:36:39.027
MATT: 28 for the first, 28 to damage, you mean?

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:41.467
ASHLEY: 28, yeah, sorry.

01:36:41.467 --> 01:36:42.327
Yes, damage.

01:36:42.327 --> 01:36:43.977
MATT: That's awesome, all right, great.

01:36:44.947 --> 01:36:46.230
ASHLEY: And then second hit.

01:36:48.217 --> 01:36:49.427
Is 18.

01:36:49.427 --> 01:36:50.836
MATT: 18 hits.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:36:57.578 --> 01:37:01.527
SAM: ♪ (sings with background music) ♪

01:37:01.527 --> 01:37:02.707
ASHLEY: 13.

01:37:02.707 --> 01:37:04.827
MATT: 13. All righty.

01:37:04.827 --> 01:37:06.747
So after you slide down,

01:37:06.747 --> 01:37:08.567
slamming your feet against the wall,

01:37:08.567 --> 01:37:10.007
barely kick yourself back up

01:37:10.007 --> 01:37:11.317
and use that momentum, you take the blade

01:37:11.317 --> 01:37:14.457
and swing once, twice heavily down upon this creature,

01:37:14.457 --> 01:37:16.757
the first strike, it's like cutting through

01:37:16.757 --> 01:37:18.797
a piece of frail brick.

01:37:18.797 --> 01:37:21.567
It impacts and breaks and then crumbles a bit.

01:37:21.567 --> 01:37:23.427
The second swipe, you cut through

01:37:23.427 --> 01:37:25.927
and you actually feel the resistance of the cold energy.

01:37:25.927 --> 01:37:27.497
And as you pull back, the blade itself

01:37:27.497 --> 01:37:29.717
now has a layer of frost across it.

01:37:29.717 --> 01:37:32.177
And as you look up, it's holding itself together,

01:37:32.177 --> 01:37:33.507
but you see it shaking a bit

01:37:33.507 --> 01:37:34.527
and the ice crystals on it

01:37:34.527 --> 01:37:37.137
are partially broken and chipped.

01:37:37.137 --> 01:37:38.867
So it's taken some heavy damage.

01:37:38.867 --> 01:37:39.867
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:37:39.867 --> 01:37:40.700
MARISHA: To one?

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:41.983
MATT: To one of them.
MARISHA: Wow.

01:37:41.983 --> 01:37:43.727
And you said there's 12?

01:37:43.727 --> 01:37:44.560
MATT: There's nine.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.393
MARISHA: There's nine.

01:37:45.393 --> 01:37:47.362
LAURA: Nein! Nine...

01:37:48.647 --> 01:37:49.480
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Look at that.

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.154
MARISHA: He always brings it around.
TRAVIS: Look at that look.

01:37:51.154 --> 01:37:52.400
LIAM: The Nonagon!

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.877
MATT: So.
LAURA: ♪ The Nonagon! ♪

01:37:53.877 --> 01:37:55.483
MARISHA: Can I get there?

01:37:55.483 --> 01:37:57.127
Oh, sorry. Are you moving on?

01:37:57.127 --> 01:37:58.944
MATT: No, is that the end of your turn?

01:38:00.117 --> 01:38:01.457
Now it's your go, Beauregard,

01:38:01.457 --> 01:38:03.827
and Caduceus, you're on deck.

01:38:03.827 --> 01:38:06.067
MARISHA: Can I get there with my speed, 50?

01:38:06.067 --> 01:38:07.054
MATT: Over to here, you mean?

01:38:07.054 --> 01:38:09.017
MARISHA: No, that brazier.

01:38:09.017 --> 01:38:09.850
MATT: With your speed, you can.
MARISHA: Can you see me

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.190
hitting that brazier, yeah.

01:38:12.111 --> 01:38:13.361
MATT: Four, five...

01:38:15.079 --> 01:38:16.937
50, you can get there, yeah.

01:38:16.937 --> 01:38:18.587
LAURA: Just think about how pretty this fight is,

01:38:18.587 --> 01:38:20.984
with all the diamond reflections on everything.

01:38:20.984 --> 01:38:22.657
MATT: It's beautiful.
LAURA: Fucking gorgeous.

01:38:22.657 --> 01:38:24.950
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw for me, please.

01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:27.007
TALIESIN: I was going to say, you want to be on that side.

01:38:27.007 --> 01:38:29.471
MARISHA: Let me roll better. Let me roll better.

01:38:29.471 --> 01:38:31.807
(laughs nervously) 29.

01:38:31.807 --> 01:38:32.927
MATT: 29.

01:38:32.927 --> 01:38:35.387
You actually use it to glide a bit.

01:38:35.387 --> 01:38:37.865
You get a few steps and then can slide.

01:38:37.865 --> 01:38:39.477
You see frost shooting off

01:38:39.477 --> 01:38:41.937
the back of your heels until you hit a bit of stone

01:38:41.937 --> 01:38:43.927
and you kick off of it to slow your momentum

01:38:43.927 --> 01:38:45.257
and then dodge around the side,

01:38:45.257 --> 01:38:46.927
right up against that one piece of ice

01:38:46.927 --> 01:38:48.917
on the side of the brazier there.

01:38:48.917 --> 01:38:49.750
MARISHA: Cool.

01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:51.387
MATT: With your passive perception,

01:38:51.387 --> 01:38:54.687
you do see, at the base of the brazier on this side,

01:38:54.687 --> 01:38:57.777
there is a small cubby about that big.

01:38:57.777 --> 01:38:59.287
MARISHA: Oh! Yeah.

01:38:59.287 --> 01:39:01.187
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get to the cubby.

01:39:01.187 --> 01:39:02.020
What's with the cubby?

01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.371
MATT: I mean, you're adjacent it, you see it.
MARISHA: Oh, I'm adjacent to the cubby.

01:39:04.371 --> 01:39:05.954
Okay.
ASHLEY: Get to the cubby!

01:39:06.799 --> 01:39:08.087
Can't do it.
MARISHA: What's in the cubby?

01:39:08.087 --> 01:39:09.167
MATT: You do take...

01:39:11.477 --> 01:39:13.077
LIAM: There's some pencils and a point eraser.

01:39:13.077 --> 01:39:15.437
MARISHA: Yeah!
MATT: You take eight points--

01:39:15.437 --> 01:39:17.647
eight points of cold damage as you enter

01:39:17.647 --> 01:39:20.790
the frozen aura of the elemental to the left of you.

01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:22.953
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:39:22.953 --> 01:39:24.619
What's in the box?

01:39:24.619 --> 01:39:25.985
What's in the cubby?

01:39:25.985 --> 01:39:27.707
MATT: You glance inside.

01:39:27.707 --> 01:39:29.487
You look and it just looks like an empty,

01:39:29.487 --> 01:39:31.827
like an empty shelf space.

01:39:31.827 --> 01:39:34.497
And you can see it opens up on the top,

01:39:34.497 --> 01:39:37.617
like it's leading up higher in the pillar.

01:39:37.617 --> 01:39:39.782
But there's nothing else you really see in there,

01:39:39.782 --> 01:39:41.687
unless you want to use your action to investigate.

01:39:41.687 --> 01:39:42.617
MARISHA: I do.

01:39:42.617 --> 01:39:45.207
MATT: Go ahead and do that,
roll an investigation check for me.

01:39:45.207 --> 01:39:47.607
MARISHA: All right. All right, all right, all right.

01:39:47.607 --> 01:39:48.547
25.

01:39:48.547 --> 01:39:49.380
MATT: Okay.

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:51.477
25. You glance inside as you feel the frost

01:39:51.477 --> 01:39:52.807
gathering around your ears now.

01:39:52.807 --> 01:39:54.597
You can't even feel that side of your face.

01:39:54.597 --> 01:39:55.430
But as you look inside,

01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:57.051
with what very little light you have,

01:39:57.051 --> 01:39:58.314
and you don't have your goggles on you

01:39:58.314 --> 01:39:59.147
because you gave those to Veth,

01:39:59.147 --> 01:40:00.637
but thankfully so rolled pretty high,

01:40:00.637 --> 01:40:02.577
so you managed to still meet the DC.

01:40:02.577 --> 01:40:03.997
You can see in the opening that heads up,

01:40:03.997 --> 01:40:05.807
at the base of it, there is some sort of

01:40:05.807 --> 01:40:08.187
a series of circles, like small,

01:40:08.187 --> 01:40:09.637
concentric circles that get smaller and smaller

01:40:09.637 --> 01:40:11.023
that are connected with various lines.

01:40:11.023 --> 01:40:12.418
MARISHA: Series of concentric circles, right?

01:40:12.418 --> 01:40:14.930
MATT: Yes. Some sort of a glyph.

01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:16.788
MARISHA: A glyph?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.117
TRAVIS: That's in the bottom of the brazier?

01:40:20.117 --> 01:40:22.457
MATT: Inside of it at the base of that opening.

01:40:23.327 --> 01:40:25.186
MARISHA: Any type of glyph that I would recognize

01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:27.486
in this quick glance?
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:40:28.659 --> 01:40:29.652
SAM: Know your glyphs.

01:40:30.697 --> 01:40:32.307
MARISHA: Name that glyph!

01:40:32.307 --> 01:40:33.357
17.

01:40:33.357 --> 01:40:34.967
MATT: 17?

01:40:34.967 --> 01:40:38.227
Vaguely, at this angle, it's kind of tough.

01:40:38.227 --> 01:40:41.892
You're getting either Transmutation or Evocation.

01:40:41.892 --> 01:40:43.097
LAURA: Oh god.

01:40:43.097 --> 01:40:44.907
MATT: Somewhere in that space.

01:40:44.907 --> 01:40:45.740
MARISHA: All right.

01:40:46.997 --> 01:40:49.847
Can I take whatever left action that I have

01:40:49.847 --> 01:40:51.504
and shout to Caleb?

01:40:51.504 --> 01:40:53.887
MATT: I'll let you shout something.
MARISHA: Or to people?

01:40:53.887 --> 01:40:55.267
All right.

01:40:55.267 --> 01:40:56.100
I'm just going to say:

01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:58.677
I think we need magic to light up these glyphs.

01:40:58.677 --> 01:40:59.697
These, sorry.

01:40:59.697 --> 01:41:02.147
I think we need magic to light up these braziers!

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:05.257
Glyph in the brazier!

01:41:05.257 --> 01:41:06.631
Brazier glyph!

01:41:06.631 --> 01:41:09.457
TRAVIS: And just to be clear, you said columns somewhere?

01:41:09.457 --> 01:41:12.244
MATT: These braziers are about five, six feet tall.

01:41:12.244 --> 01:41:14.427
And they're just these columns in the middle of the ground.

01:41:14.427 --> 01:41:16.727
And they look just solid

01:41:16.727 --> 01:41:18.503
except for on the opposite end.

01:41:18.503 --> 01:41:21.644
There's a slight opening, like a tiny oven,

01:41:21.644 --> 01:41:23.242
like a clay oven entrance.

01:41:23.242 --> 01:41:24.937
SAM: ♪ (vocalizes horn wail in background music) ♪

01:41:24.937 --> 01:41:26.477
MARISHA: Do I have a bonus action still?

01:41:26.477 --> 01:41:27.377
MATT: You do.

01:41:27.377 --> 01:41:28.507
MARISHA: Patient Defense.

01:41:28.507 --> 01:41:30.240
MATT: Okay. You get ready.

01:41:31.967 --> 01:41:34.036
MARISHA: That's my turn.
LAURA: What's happening?

01:41:34.036 --> 01:41:35.597
MATT: Caduceus, you're up. Veth, you're on deck.

01:41:35.597 --> 01:41:36.560
SAM: Bad ice.

01:41:38.787 --> 01:41:40.257
TALIESIN: It'd be a bad thing to find out

01:41:40.257 --> 01:41:43.558
if these guys get an attack of opportunity.

01:41:43.558 --> 01:41:44.667
MATT: At the start of your turn.

01:41:44.667 --> 01:41:46.287
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

01:41:46.287 --> 01:41:48.247
MATT: Because you are standing within the frozen aura

01:41:48.247 --> 01:41:49.449
of four of these creatures.

01:41:49.449 --> 01:41:50.557
LAURA: Oh no!

01:41:52.065 --> 01:41:53.207
MATT: Rolled pretty low.

01:41:54.877 --> 01:41:56.977
You take 11 points of cold damage.

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:57.810
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:42:00.287 --> 01:42:01.510
TALIESIN: Don't like that.

01:42:02.837 --> 01:42:04.140
Oh boy, okay.

01:42:05.787 --> 01:42:07.287
That certainly changes things.

01:42:10.195 --> 01:42:12.657
MATT: Yasha, because I almost forgot.

01:42:12.657 --> 01:42:14.337
You take an additional eight points of cold damage

01:42:14.337 --> 01:42:16.607
from striking it with a melee attack.

01:42:16.607 --> 01:42:17.440
ASHLEY: Eight points?

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.273
MATT: Correct.

01:42:20.627 --> 01:42:24.197
MARISHA: I can maybe move and like, tank for you.

01:42:24.197 --> 01:42:25.547
Maybe draw them away.

01:42:25.547 --> 01:42:26.802
LIAM: I'm surrounded.

01:42:26.802 --> 01:42:28.547
MARISHA: I know, but...

01:42:28.547 --> 01:42:32.717
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians at level three.

01:42:32.717 --> 01:42:34.007
MATT: Spirit Guardians, all righty.

01:42:34.007 --> 01:42:35.577
MARISHA: Can you cast from a distance?

01:42:35.577 --> 01:42:37.217
You don't necessarily need to get up to them.

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:39.077
LIAM: No, I know, that's probably

01:42:39.077 --> 01:42:40.007
what I'm going to do--
TALIESIN: 15 feet.

01:42:40.007 --> 01:42:41.407
LIAM: But I'm like, is it going to light them up

01:42:41.407 --> 01:42:44.217
or is it going to damage?
MATT: 15 feet radius, you said?

01:42:44.217 --> 01:42:45.050
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:42:45.050 --> 01:42:46.697
MATT: So 15 feet radius would be this.

01:42:46.697 --> 01:42:48.167
MARISHA: Evocation or Transmutation?

01:42:48.167 --> 01:42:51.065
LIAM: Yeah, I mean that's either hit it with fire

01:42:51.065 --> 01:42:53.687
or dump some transmutation, but it's probably fire.

01:42:53.687 --> 01:42:54.520
TALIESIN: Let's see.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:55.353
LIAM: That's what I was going to do

01:42:55.353 --> 01:42:56.611
before you even got there.

01:42:56.611 --> 01:42:59.570
TALIESIN: So I'm going to just try and curl my way around

01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:02.247
where Jester's duplicate is and I'm just going to see

01:43:02.247 --> 01:43:05.118
what happens when I step away from one of them.

01:43:05.118 --> 01:43:06.151
MATT: Try and step away from--

SAM: ♪ (vocalizes horn wail in background music) ♪

01:43:07.383 --> 01:43:08.216
MATT: From one of them?

01:43:08.216 --> 01:43:10.090
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to stay in the--

01:43:10.090 --> 01:43:11.647
MATT: Right there?
TALIESIN: -- attack realm of, yeah.

01:43:11.647 --> 01:43:12.480
MATT: Okay.

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:15.147
So as you move back that one as a reaction,

01:43:15.147 --> 01:43:18.470
you feel this energy lash at you like a frozen whip.

01:43:21.057 --> 01:43:22.027
That is a 13.

01:43:22.027 --> 01:43:22.860
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:24.807
MATT: So you manage to move aside.

01:43:24.807 --> 01:43:25.640
TALIESIN: Shit.

01:43:27.129 --> 01:43:30.297
All right, can I do anything as a bonus action

01:43:30.297 --> 01:43:31.430
or am I just?

01:43:37.738 --> 01:43:40.377
Nope, there's nothing I can do as a bonus action

01:43:40.377 --> 01:43:41.847
because all of my spells are

01:43:43.447 --> 01:43:44.537
bullshit at the moment.

01:43:44.537 --> 01:43:45.767
I can't cast Healing Word

01:43:45.767 --> 01:43:46.600
because I just put up Spirit Guardians, right?

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.307
MATT: Correct, yes.
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

01:43:48.307 --> 01:43:50.377
MATT: Sorry, buddy.
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

01:43:50.377 --> 01:43:51.210
Is that your turn?

01:43:51.210 --> 01:43:53.117
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's my fucking turn.

01:43:53.117 --> 01:43:54.156
(laughter)

01:43:54.156 --> 01:43:55.739
MATT: Okay!

01:43:55.739 --> 01:43:56.824
ASHLEY: Oh, I hate that feeling.

01:43:56.824 --> 01:43:58.730
MATT: Veth, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

01:44:00.547 --> 01:44:02.057
SAM: Jester's still holding the rope, right?

01:44:02.057 --> 01:44:03.277
LAURA: Yep!
MATT: Yep.

01:44:03.277 --> 01:44:05.671
SAM: I'm going to jump on it and run down the rope!

01:44:05.671 --> 01:44:06.921
(quick footsteps)

01:44:06.921 --> 01:44:09.647
MARISHA: Oh, ninja!

01:44:09.647 --> 01:44:11.289
LAURA: I let go of the rope. Just kidding.

01:44:11.289 --> 01:44:13.087
SAM: (screams)
(laughter)

01:44:13.087 --> 01:44:14.030
MATT: What's your speed?

01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:15.119
SAM: 35.

01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:16.227
MATT: 35 gets you right there.

01:44:16.227 --> 01:44:18.987
SAM: You know what though? I think I'll stop early.

01:44:20.319 --> 01:44:22.377
It seems dangerous in there.

01:44:22.377 --> 01:44:26.957
And also, I don't know who's engaged with who.

01:44:26.957 --> 01:44:28.857
So I'll stop even earlier, maybe just outside

01:44:28.857 --> 01:44:30.767
the Spirit Guardian range.
MATT: You got it.

01:44:30.767 --> 01:44:33.157
SAM: And I'm going to whip out this--

01:44:33.157 --> 01:44:34.857
somewhere I got this, but I have it,

01:44:34.857 --> 01:44:36.087
so I'm going to use it.

01:44:36.087 --> 01:44:39.487
I'm going to whip out this scroll and read it.

01:44:39.487 --> 01:44:41.912
And cast Flaming Sphere.

01:44:41.912 --> 01:44:42.997
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:44:42.997 --> 01:44:44.187
MATT: Okay.

01:44:44.187 --> 01:44:45.020
LIAM: Bowling.

01:44:48.217 --> 01:44:49.940
MATT: Where would you like to place the Sphere?

01:44:51.928 --> 01:44:53.757
SAM: The one next to Caduceus, but, you know,

01:44:53.757 --> 01:44:55.624
in a way that doesn't hurt Caduceus.

01:44:55.624 --> 01:44:56.457
TRAVIS: It'll roll downhill.

01:44:56.457 --> 01:44:57.290
MATT: Right, so right here?

01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:58.157
SAM: And, I don't know,

01:44:58.157 --> 01:44:59.357
I've never cast this before,

01:44:59.357 --> 01:45:00.937
I can roll it around, right?

01:45:00.937 --> 01:45:02.027
MATT: You can.

01:45:02.027 --> 01:45:02.867
LAURA: Cool!

01:45:02.867 --> 01:45:03.700
MATT: In fact.
LIAM: Like a bowling ball.

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:05.817
TALIESIN: Maybe there's three in a row, or.

01:45:05.817 --> 01:45:07.737
SAM: Yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to be

01:45:07.737 --> 01:45:10.654
a straight line, right? Like, I can go around with it?

01:45:10.654 --> 01:45:11.487
TRAVIS: Bend that shit?

01:45:11.487 --> 01:45:12.703
LAURA: Do a topsy-turvy ball?
MATT: I'll show you.

01:45:12.703 --> 01:45:16.745
LAURA: What are those little raccoon balls with the tails?

01:45:16.745 --> 01:45:19.567
MATT: It appears anywhere in 60 feet.

01:45:19.567 --> 01:45:21.287
And any creature that ends its turn

01:45:21.287 --> 01:45:23.587
within five feet of it has to make a dex save

01:45:23.587 --> 01:45:25.177
or take 2d6 damage.

01:45:25.177 --> 01:45:26.997
So anything nearby that ends its turn

01:45:26.997 --> 01:45:28.557
next to it takes damage.

01:45:28.557 --> 01:45:30.127
Also, as a bonus action, you can move it

01:45:30.127 --> 01:45:32.867
up to 30 feet and ram it into a creature.

01:45:32.867 --> 01:45:35.091
In which case, that creature also has to try

01:45:35.091 --> 01:45:36.257
and make the dex save.
SAM: But it can't just go,

01:45:36.257 --> 01:45:38.366
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop and hit them all?

01:45:38.366 --> 01:45:40.187
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: But if it's next to two?

01:45:40.187 --> 01:45:41.297
MATT: You can ram it next to a creature

01:45:41.297 --> 01:45:42.487
and then other creatures have to move away from it

01:45:42.487 --> 01:45:44.247
or if they end their turn next to it they take damage.

01:45:44.247 --> 01:45:45.095
SAM: Well then, in that case,

01:45:45.095 --> 01:45:48.227
I'll make it appear between two of them.

01:45:48.227 --> 01:45:50.027
Because it has a five-foot, I guess,

01:45:50.027 --> 01:45:51.397
radius or something, right?

01:45:51.397 --> 01:45:53.107
MATT: You can put it next to...

01:45:54.527 --> 01:45:56.287
You can put it here and get it next to three of them.

01:45:56.287 --> 01:45:57.120
SAM: Yeah, that!
MATT: But it'll also be

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.327
next to Caduceus, so you'll have to move

01:45:58.327 --> 01:46:01.043
out of its range next turn, your call.

01:46:01.043 --> 01:46:02.641
TALIESIN: Put it on the other side, maybe?

01:46:02.641 --> 01:46:04.717
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe I'll just go for two of them.

01:46:04.717 --> 01:46:05.550
I'll go for two of them.

01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:07.137
MATT: Two of them. There you go.

01:46:07.137 --> 01:46:08.377
So as you finish reading the scroll,

01:46:08.377 --> 01:46:09.677
as you're holding onto the rope

01:46:09.677 --> 01:46:12.283
and grabbing it, the scroll burns away

01:46:12.283 --> 01:46:14.667
and you guys hear this strange whining sound

01:46:14.667 --> 01:46:18.627
as this little opening seems to open in the air

01:46:18.627 --> 01:46:21.807
and (whooshes) this ball of fire emerges from it,

01:46:21.807 --> 01:46:24.020
slops onto the ground and begins rolling.

01:46:25.047 --> 01:46:26.517
So it lands there.

01:46:26.517 --> 01:46:28.887
You can use your bonus action
to ram one of those, if you'd like to.

01:46:28.887 --> 01:46:30.667
SAM: Oh wow. I will do that.

01:46:30.667 --> 01:46:33.487
I will pick a random ice thing to ram.

01:46:33.487 --> 01:46:34.717
MATT: All right, so the one directly--

01:46:34.717 --> 01:46:36.487
which of these two would you like to hit?

01:46:36.487 --> 01:46:37.650
SAM: The ice-y one.

01:46:38.827 --> 01:46:39.895
They're all the same to me.

01:46:39.895 --> 01:46:41.098
MATT: Sure!

01:46:41.098 --> 01:46:43.540
SAM: The better, the more attractive one.

01:46:44.567 --> 01:46:45.400
MATT: You got it.

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.637
(laughter)

01:46:49.637 --> 01:46:52.017
It does not make its saving throw.

01:46:52.017 --> 01:46:54.014
So go ahead and roll 2d6.

01:46:54.014 --> 01:46:55.017
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

01:46:55.017 --> 01:46:56.917
I assume it's vulnerable or--

01:46:56.917 --> 01:46:59.997
Oh, come on, double ones?!

01:46:59.997 --> 01:47:01.388
Poo.
MATT: Aw.

01:47:02.303 --> 01:47:05.046
SAM: Two points!
MARISHA: Double ones? Oh my god.

01:47:05.046 --> 01:47:07.384
MATT: So the sphere attempts to ram into it

01:47:07.384 --> 01:47:08.577
and it dodges out of the way,

01:47:08.577 --> 01:47:11.077
the flames lick past and it takes a little bit of damage.

01:47:11.077 --> 01:47:13.527
SAM: Does it double the damage because it's made of ice?

01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:15.567
MATT: You don't know, you barely hit the thing!

01:47:15.567 --> 01:47:19.087
SAM: But does it say,
"Argh! I'm so attractive, not the face!"

01:47:19.087 --> 01:47:19.920
Or anything?

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.097
MATT: You have no idea.
SAM: All right.

01:47:21.097 --> 01:47:22.977
MATT: You rolled double ones, yo.

01:47:22.977 --> 01:47:24.849
All right, that finish your turn, Veth?

01:47:24.849 --> 01:47:26.607
SAM: Yes.
MATT: You got it. Caleb, you're up.

01:47:26.607 --> 01:47:28.327
LIAM: I have a question about the spell

01:47:28.327 --> 01:47:30.187
that you and I worked out together.

01:47:30.187 --> 01:47:34.217
Web of Fire, it says "flame crackles out around the caster

01:47:34.217 --> 01:47:37.347
"and streaks of fire rapidly snake along the ground."

01:47:37.347 --> 01:47:40.187
It doesn't say-- we didn't write in stone:

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:42.880
straight lines, arching, curving?

01:47:43.727 --> 01:47:45.187
What kind of control do I have on them?

01:47:45.187 --> 01:47:46.047
MATT: We said you have control over

01:47:46.047 --> 01:47:47.500
to hit the certain creatures you want to,

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.467
you still have control of that.

01:47:48.467 --> 01:47:50.157
LIAM: Okay, well then I'm going to try this.

01:47:50.157 --> 01:47:51.897
I'm going to pull out the cat's cradle

01:47:51.897 --> 01:47:53.037
crusted over in phosphorus

01:47:53.037 --> 01:47:54.767
and then slam it down into the ground

01:47:54.767 --> 01:47:57.587
and send all five of them forward

01:47:57.587 --> 01:47:58.507
along the line of the rope

01:47:58.507 --> 01:48:00.277
and then splitting out

01:48:00.277 --> 01:48:02.377
and sending one to each of the braziers

01:48:02.377 --> 01:48:04.152
to erupt at each brazier.

01:48:04.152 --> 01:48:06.510
MARISHA: Oh, get it!
LIAM: And one

01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:09.228
on the one that is hurting Ca--

01:48:09.228 --> 01:48:13.023
the one closest to Jester's duplicate.

01:48:13.023 --> 01:48:15.085
MATT: Okay. What's the range on that?
LIAM: 60 feet.

01:48:15.085 --> 01:48:16.385
MARISHA: Please work.
MATT: 60 feet?

01:48:19.867 --> 01:48:21.697
Okay, so.

01:48:21.697 --> 01:48:24.977
You watch as Caleb, first at the top of your turn

01:48:24.977 --> 01:48:27.797
because you are in range of three of them,

01:48:27.797 --> 01:48:29.614
you immediately take...

01:48:32.417 --> 01:48:33.370
21 points of cold damage.

01:48:33.370 --> 01:48:34.297
LIAM: Okay.

01:48:34.297 --> 01:48:36.267
MATT: From the auras burning into you.

01:48:36.267 --> 01:48:38.247
And right now you begin to lose feeling

01:48:38.247 --> 01:48:39.907
in your fingers and arms,

01:48:39.907 --> 01:48:42.267
but you've practiced this over and over again.

01:48:42.267 --> 01:48:43.567
So even without feeling,

01:48:43.567 --> 01:48:44.987
you still go through the motions.

01:48:44.987 --> 01:48:46.277
And as you slam your hands down,

01:48:46.277 --> 01:48:48.077
you watch as this arcane energy sparkles

01:48:48.077 --> 01:48:49.337
at the tips of his fingers.

01:48:49.337 --> 01:48:52.317
And as it hits the frost and stone,

01:48:52.317 --> 01:48:54.577
they spider out into these little burning,

01:48:54.577 --> 01:48:57.627
web-like filaments, like you'd see five separate elements

01:48:57.627 --> 01:49:00.080
of black powder paths, or--

01:49:01.757 --> 01:49:02.699
what's the word I'm looking for?

01:49:02.699 --> 01:49:04.957
MARISHA: Fuse?
MATT: Fuses, thank you.

01:49:04.957 --> 01:49:06.427
Snaking across the ground, they (whooshes)

01:49:06.427 --> 01:49:08.244
up to the middle of it and then

01:49:08.244 --> 01:49:09.653
spread out to all five of them.

01:49:09.653 --> 01:49:12.754
Where do you send them on the braziers?

01:49:12.754 --> 01:49:16.477
LIAM: Well, Beauregard's at a little hole, a cubby, right?

01:49:16.477 --> 01:49:19.798
So I will do my best to aim, if I can see those,

01:49:19.798 --> 01:49:22.067
to the side, to hit the sides

01:49:22.067 --> 01:49:23.757
where those ports would be

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:25.757
to erupt along the side of it.

01:49:25.757 --> 01:49:27.427
To try to fart fire

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:28.637
into the little port.
MATT: I understand.

01:49:28.637 --> 01:49:30.227
I will say you can see all of them.

01:49:30.227 --> 01:49:32.847
The one that Beauregard's at is a little obscured.

01:49:32.847 --> 01:49:34.677
Make a perception check for me.

01:49:34.677 --> 01:49:36.827
LIAM: What if I just aimed where Beauregard is?

01:49:38.787 --> 01:49:40.077
MATT: Then you might hit Beauregard.

01:49:40.077 --> 01:49:40.910
LIAM: I know.

01:49:41.794 --> 01:49:43.187
MARISHA: I've got Evasion.

01:49:43.187 --> 01:49:44.767
LIAM: Yeah. That's what I do.

01:49:44.767 --> 01:49:46.717
TRAVIS: Wreck her!
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:49:46.717 --> 01:49:47.807
So...
MARISHA: Do it.

01:49:47.807 --> 01:49:49.182
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

01:49:49.182 --> 01:49:50.940
MARISHA: I approve of this message.

01:49:55.227 --> 01:49:57.687
LIAM: 26 points of fire damage.

01:49:57.687 --> 01:49:58.929
MATT: 26 points of fire damage?

01:49:58.929 --> 01:50:00.367
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:50:00.367 --> 01:50:01.980
Make a dexterity saving throw.

01:50:03.407 --> 01:50:06.017
MARISHA: I get to do Evasion, right?
TRAVIS: Higher than a 10!

01:50:06.017 --> 01:50:10.407
MATT: Evasion is if you succeed.
LIAM: Half or zero.

01:50:10.407 --> 01:50:13.537
MARISHA: If I succeed. Right, right, right, right, right.

01:50:13.537 --> 01:50:15.007
17.

01:50:15.007 --> 01:50:15.967
MATT: What's your DC?

01:50:15.967 --> 01:50:17.457
LIAM: Oh, higher than that.

01:50:17.457 --> 01:50:19.537
MARISHA: Yeah. I rolled terribly.
LIAM: 18.

01:50:19.537 --> 01:50:20.857
MATT: Yeah, so you take

01:50:20.857 --> 01:50:21.877
the full brunt of it.
TRAVIS: What are you doing today?

01:50:21.877 --> 01:50:24.877
MARISHA: I rolled a seven again. I've rolled so many sevens.

01:50:24.877 --> 01:50:26.192
LAURA: Are you changing out your dice?

01:50:26.192 --> 01:50:29.342
MARISHA: I am! This was supposed to be the Beau die!

01:50:29.342 --> 01:50:30.747
LIAM: Evasion makes it-- it's been a while

01:50:30.747 --> 01:50:32.477
since I've been a rogue, but half damage, right?

01:50:32.477 --> 01:50:33.957
MATT: It's half damage on a success

01:50:33.957 --> 01:50:37.427
and then no damage on a failure.

01:50:37.427 --> 01:50:38.797
Sorry, no, sorry.
MARISHA: The reverse.

01:50:38.797 --> 01:50:40.367
MATT: Half damage on a failure.
LIAM: If she succeeded,

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:41.537
she would've taken zero.

01:50:41.537 --> 01:50:42.407
MATT: Correct. Sorry.
LIAM: If she failed,

01:50:42.407 --> 01:50:43.240
she takes half.

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:44.376
MATT: Yes, so you take half the fire damage

01:50:44.376 --> 01:50:45.209
that was there.

01:50:45.209 --> 01:50:46.777
MARISHA: Which is 20, sorry, 14?
LIAM: 26 halved.

01:50:46.777 --> 01:50:48.969
MATT: So, 13. 13 points of fire damage.

01:50:49.957 --> 01:50:51.137
MARISHA: Oh, shit, shit, shit.
MATT: You suddenly,

01:50:51.137 --> 01:50:52.417
as you're like defending against

01:50:52.417 --> 01:50:54.837
this weird crystal, you see this,
out of the corner of your eye,

01:50:54.837 --> 01:50:56.767
this little red (whooshes).

01:50:56.767 --> 01:50:59.907
And right as you notice it, you burst into flames.

01:50:59.907 --> 01:51:01.910
You are on fire!

01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:03.517
TALIESIN: Yeah, you are!

01:51:03.517 --> 01:51:05.277
MARISHA: By all mathematics, I should've been able

01:51:05.277 --> 01:51:07.157
to dodge that, so...

01:51:08.394 --> 01:51:09.477
SAM: That's hot.

01:51:11.127 --> 01:51:14.313
MARISHA: Just rolled terribly.
TRAVIS: You are on fire!

01:51:14.313 --> 01:51:16.482
Hey, we got fucking fire!

01:51:16.482 --> 01:51:20.147
MARISHA: ♪ This girl is on fire ♪

01:51:20.147 --> 01:51:20.980
LAURA: Oh god!

01:51:23.801 --> 01:51:26.307
MARISHA: Worth it. Worth it.
TRAVIS: (sings)

01:51:26.307 --> 01:51:29.907
MATT: So you watch as the majority of these streak off,

01:51:29.907 --> 01:51:32.587
up inside of these small little open spaces.

01:51:32.587 --> 01:51:35.887
And then (whooshes), the top of the pillars

01:51:35.887 --> 01:51:38.067
suddenly burst into arcane flame.

01:51:38.067 --> 01:51:40.237
As it does, immediately you see

01:51:40.237 --> 01:51:43.637
all these ice entities seem to shiver and quiff,

01:51:43.637 --> 01:51:46.137
quiver at the immediate reaction, you know what I mean!

01:51:46.137 --> 01:51:47.517
TALIESIN: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:51:47.517 --> 01:51:49.233
Carry on.
SAM: Queef?

01:51:49.233 --> 01:51:50.525
MATT: Quiff! You know, quiff!

01:51:50.525 --> 01:51:53.917
(laughter)

01:51:53.917 --> 01:51:55.557
It's been a long day.

01:51:55.557 --> 01:51:56.767
TALIESIN: My last laugh, Matt, for the day.

01:51:56.767 --> 01:51:57.600
LIAM: Too dry in here for that.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.247
MATT: Indeed.

01:51:59.247 --> 01:52:00.425
Too cold in here for that!

01:52:00.425 --> 01:52:03.637
(laughter)

01:52:03.637 --> 01:52:07.615
Quiver and shift to the proximity of the fire.

01:52:07.615 --> 01:52:10.320
MARISHA: The shivering queef! (giggles)

01:52:11.630 --> 01:52:13.802
SAM: You're a child, Marisha. A child.

01:52:15.712 --> 01:52:18.087
LIAM: That's the Big Bad. That's the Big Bad.

01:52:18.087 --> 01:52:19.898
TALIESIN: Man, I haven't snorted in a while.

01:52:19.898 --> 01:52:24.265
(laughter)

01:52:24.265 --> 01:52:26.104
MARISHA: Oh, it's the exhaustion.

01:52:26.104 --> 01:52:27.137
TALIESIN: I know.

01:52:28.913 --> 01:52:29.971
LAURA: Okay.

01:52:29.971 --> 01:52:30.837
MATT: And then one of them hits the one

01:52:30.837 --> 01:52:33.217
that's by Caduceus, on this side, you said?

01:52:33.217 --> 01:52:35.987
LIAM: The one that's smack-dab against Jester's duplicate.

01:52:35.987 --> 01:52:37.357
MATT: You got it.

01:52:37.357 --> 01:52:40.697
It does not succeed on save, so it's 26 points of damage.

01:52:43.617 --> 01:52:46.117
As it (whooshes)

01:52:46.117 --> 01:52:48.767
shoots up and ignites and bursts around it--

01:52:50.307 --> 01:52:54.287
Jesus!
(laughter)

01:52:54.287 --> 01:52:56.307
You watch as the fire consumes

01:52:56.307 --> 01:52:59.107
a majority of its exterior and as the flames burn away,

01:52:59.107 --> 01:53:01.007
it's barely holding on.

01:53:01.007 --> 01:53:03.267
The crystals have mostly now melted away

01:53:03.267 --> 01:53:06.067
and its small pulsing blue energy

01:53:06.067 --> 01:53:09.058
is barely maintaining cohesion.

01:53:10.897 --> 01:53:12.370
That finish your turn?

01:53:12.370 --> 01:53:13.827
LIAM: Yeah. I'll stay put.

01:53:13.827 --> 01:53:15.627
I will get hurt if I try to move.

01:53:15.627 --> 01:53:17.489
MATT: All right, that finishes Caleb's go.

01:53:17.489 --> 01:53:18.967
Fjord, you're up.

01:53:18.967 --> 01:53:21.287
TRAVIS: Can I try and pull myself up this rope

01:53:21.287 --> 01:53:23.530
to the top of the entrance?

01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:26.887
Because I'm outside.

01:53:26.887 --> 01:53:27.720
MATT: Up to here, yeah.

01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:29.047
TRAVIS: Yeah, and then can I see

01:53:29.047 --> 01:53:31.293
any of this happening down below me?

01:53:31.293 --> 01:53:33.377
MATT: You've been able to see all this happen. You're like--

01:53:33.377 --> 01:53:35.074
at this point, everyone had pulled up inside

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:35.907
and there was a bit of tunnel

01:53:35.907 --> 01:53:36.967
before the entrance.

01:53:36.967 --> 01:53:38.220
So you've seen everything in front of you.

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:39.637
TRAVIS: I think I'll just hold onto the rope

01:53:39.637 --> 01:53:44.557
and I'll unleash some Eldritch Blast at that

01:53:46.327 --> 01:53:48.457
one that's nearest to Caduceus, closest to me.

01:53:48.457 --> 01:53:50.654
MATT: You got it, go ahead and roll an attack on that one.

01:53:51.707 --> 01:53:53.549
LIAM: I got this one move. It's crazy.

01:53:53.549 --> 01:53:54.382
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:53:54.382 --> 01:53:57.307
(laughter)

01:53:57.307 --> 01:53:59.493
MARISHA: Stop, I was just getting better!

01:53:59.493 --> 01:54:02.243
ASHLEY: Me, too. I got the giggles.
TRAVIS: 19?

01:54:03.257 --> 01:54:05.057
MATT: 19 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

01:54:05.997 --> 01:54:08.000
Ah, I'm going to
fucking murder all of you!

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.246
(laughter)

01:54:10.246 --> 01:54:11.079
TRAVIS: That's...

01:54:11.079 --> 01:54:14.045
(laughter)

01:54:14.045 --> 01:54:15.474
15 points of force damage.

01:54:15.474 --> 01:54:18.114
MATT: 15 points of force damage.
SAM: 50?!

01:54:18.114 --> 01:54:19.307
50?!

01:54:19.307 --> 01:54:20.657
TRAVIS: One five, one five.

01:54:20.657 --> 01:54:21.867
LAURA and SAM: Oh, 15.

01:54:21.867 --> 01:54:23.067
MATT: 15.

01:54:23.067 --> 01:54:24.097
TRAVIS: 19 to hit?

01:54:24.097 --> 01:54:25.637
MATT: 19 hits.

01:54:25.637 --> 01:54:27.717
TRAVIS: That is 12 points of force damage.

01:54:27.717 --> 01:54:28.742
MATT: 12 points, you got it.

01:54:28.742 --> 01:54:30.329
TRAVIS: And then the third--
SAM: 200 points?!

01:54:30.329 --> 01:54:31.885
TRAVIS: Yep!

01:54:31.885 --> 01:54:33.107
And another 18.

01:54:33.107 --> 01:54:33.940
MATT: Yep, hits.

01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:35.114
TRAVIS: Okay, great. Last one.

01:54:36.157 --> 01:54:38.930
Is 13 points of force damage.

01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:41.437
MATT: 13 points of force damage, nice.

01:54:41.437 --> 01:54:43.287
You fire them off. As they impact the sides of it,

01:54:43.287 --> 01:54:45.207
you see it hit the ground with a clatter

01:54:45.207 --> 01:54:46.917
and then lift back up.

01:54:46.917 --> 01:54:47.750
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: It looks hurt,

01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:49.250
but it's still fairly hearty.

01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:50.942
TRAVIS: I'll stay where I am.

01:54:50.942 --> 01:54:52.487
MATT: You got it. Finishing that, brings us to the top.

01:54:52.487 --> 01:54:53.617
Jester, you're up.

01:54:53.617 --> 01:54:54.450
LAURA: Okay.

01:54:54.450 --> 01:54:55.797
MATT: Beginning of your turn.

01:54:55.797 --> 01:54:57.011
SAM: Okay.

01:54:58.294 --> 01:55:01.127
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:55:02.067 --> 01:55:03.897
MATT: 19 points of cold damage, reduced to nine.

01:55:03.897 --> 01:55:04.730
SAM: Oh!

01:55:06.387 --> 01:55:07.220
LAURA: Okay.

01:55:08.177 --> 01:55:10.737
Oh my god.
MARISHA: You got this. (laughs)

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:12.047
LAURA: Okay.

01:55:12.047 --> 01:55:13.527
I'm going to...

01:55:16.407 --> 01:55:21.147
Would I know-- does radiant fire damage--

01:55:21.147 --> 01:55:22.827
that's not like fire damage?

01:55:22.827 --> 01:55:26.137
MATT: No, it's a holy burning, but it's not considered fire.

01:55:26.137 --> 01:55:27.237
LAURA: It's not fire, okay.

01:55:28.257 --> 01:55:29.090
Okay.

01:55:30.607 --> 01:55:32.167
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.

01:55:32.167 --> 01:55:35.447
Then I'm going to follow in Caduceus' footstep

01:55:35.447 --> 01:55:40.037
and I'm going to cast Spiritual Guardians.

01:55:40.037 --> 01:55:41.275
MATT: All righty.

01:55:41.275 --> 01:55:42.108
LAURA: On...

01:55:44.167 --> 01:55:47.560
I'm going to cast it on where I am.

01:55:49.535 --> 01:55:52.196
On my real person.

01:55:52.196 --> 01:55:53.304
MATT: All righty.

01:55:56.177 --> 01:55:59.290
LAURA: And that's at 3rd-level. Ooh!

01:55:59.290 --> 01:56:00.783
Yeah, 3rd-level.
MATT: Okay.

01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.670
LAURA: And then I'll use my Spiritual Weapon

01:56:04.670 --> 01:56:07.610
to attack the ice crystal that I attacked before.

01:56:07.610 --> 01:56:09.801
MATT: Okay, so you shift it over here.

01:56:09.801 --> 01:56:11.968
LAURA: Ooh, natural 20! (laughs)

01:56:11.968 --> 01:56:13.443
MATT: Great! So that's double damage on it.

01:56:13.443 --> 01:56:14.762
So go ahead and roll and double the dice.

01:56:14.762 --> 01:56:15.598
LAURA: Great.

01:56:17.948 --> 01:56:22.608
Ooh, 14 plus five, 19!
MATT: 14 plus five's 19, nice!

01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.160
So as it moves towards the edge of Caduceus' radius,

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:28.524
it slams into the--

01:56:28.524 --> 01:56:31.666
(laughter)

01:56:31.666 --> 01:56:33.355
SAM: It's still bouncing around!

01:56:33.355 --> 01:56:35.500
MATT: (laughs) Apparently! This is--

01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:36.807
TALIESIN: It's like The Wave,

01:56:36.807 --> 01:56:38.040
making its way around the circle.
MATT: It really is. It keeps making its way

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.500
around the circle, yeah.

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:42.317
LIAM: No eye contact, no eye contact.

01:56:42.317 --> 01:56:43.674
ASHLEY: But the thing is, guys,

01:56:43.674 --> 01:56:46.208
I love that we're all laughing about farts right now.

01:56:46.208 --> 01:56:48.270
MATT: Yep, yep.

01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:51.890
I love it. All right, so yeah. You swing past the barrier

01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:54.480
of spiritual guardians that are swarming around Caduceus.

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.910
As your giant serrated lollipop swings

01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:59.610
through the blanket of celestial beetles,

01:56:59.610 --> 01:57:01.210
it crashes into this elemental.

01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:02.043
It takes a heavy hit.

01:57:02.043 --> 01:57:03.463
It's starting to look pretty hurt.

01:57:03.463 --> 01:57:06.884
LAURA: Whoa, okay. It's taken three hits already

01:57:06.884 --> 01:57:09.050
and it's still only-- jeez louise!

01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:10.450
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn?

01:57:10.450 --> 01:57:12.290
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: It's now their turn.

01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:14.620
So at the beginning of the round--
TRAVIS: (fart noise)

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:16.640
MATT: Go ahead and roll your damage for both of your--

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:18.147
TALIESIN: And they have to all make wisdom saves.

01:57:18.147 --> 01:57:19.436
MARISHA: For my on fire?

01:57:20.386 --> 01:57:21.999
MATT: Here we go.

01:57:21.999 --> 01:57:24.164
TALIESIN: Boo!
LAURA: What is it?

01:57:24.164 --> 01:57:26.345
3d8.
TALIESIN: It's 3d8.

01:57:26.345 --> 01:57:27.403
LAURA: 3d8.

01:57:27.403 --> 01:57:29.764
TALIESIN: Boo, boo.
MATT: Success.

01:57:31.122 --> 01:57:32.272
Failure.

01:57:32.272 --> 01:57:34.310
And failure.

01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:35.380
So the top two over there are success.

01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:36.325
So what was the damage roll?

01:57:36.325 --> 01:57:38.122
TALIESIN: Seven.
MATT: Seven, all right,

01:57:38.122 --> 01:57:40.713
so not great, but that's okay.
TALIESIN: No.

01:57:40.713 --> 01:57:41.904
LAURA: 17.

01:57:41.904 --> 01:57:44.217
MARISHA: Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

01:57:44.217 --> 01:57:48.739
LAURA: Oh, wait, no. It's not plus anything.
It's just 3d8, right?

01:57:48.739 --> 01:57:51.920
TALIESIN: 3d8.
LAURA: 3d8 flat, 12.

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:52.753
MATT: All righty.

01:57:53.832 --> 01:57:56.849
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: (sighs)

01:57:56.849 --> 01:57:58.630
TALIESIN: And the fireball does damage on their turn

01:57:58.630 --> 01:57:59.980
as well, right?
MATT: It does.

01:58:01.539 --> 01:58:04.864
And then 12, two, fail.

01:58:04.864 --> 01:58:06.510
MARISHA: (cry-laughing) I don't know why.

01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:08.648
MATT: Success, no, fail, actually.

01:58:08.648 --> 01:58:10.500
LAURA: Oh. (laughs)

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.308
MATT: What's your DC again, 17?

01:58:12.308 --> 01:58:13.424
LAURA, TALIESIN, and MATT: 18.

01:58:13.424 --> 01:58:16.796
MATT: Fail, and fail.

01:58:16.796 --> 01:58:17.700
So 12 for all of it.

01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:18.550
TALIESIN: That was it.

01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:22.490
Do I have any other d4s to use if I'm conscious long enough?

01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:26.307
MATT: The one that Yasha had struck last round is assaulted.

01:58:26.307 --> 01:58:30.257
by a swirl of tiny pink hamster unicorns,

01:58:30.257 --> 01:58:31.657
and you watch as it shakes

01:58:31.657 --> 01:58:33.730
in place and then (explosion) shatters

01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:37.433
into frozen moisture and crystal ice upon the ground.

01:58:37.433 --> 01:58:40.320
LAURA: I want them to look like inferno unicorns now,

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:43.160
so they're-- they look like they're on fire.

01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:44.850
MATT: Okay. Angry, burning red eyes?

01:58:44.850 --> 01:58:45.683
LAURA: Yes, yes.
TRAVIS: Nightmares?

01:58:45.683 --> 01:58:47.224
MATT: Perfect. You got it.
LAURA: Yeah, nightmares!

01:58:47.224 --> 01:58:48.718
MATT: The two that are next to your--

01:58:48.718 --> 01:58:49.632
SAM: (surprised noise)

01:58:49.632 --> 01:58:52.490
MATT: -- all fail.
SAM: Do I roll?

01:58:52.490 --> 01:58:55.010
MATT: And-- you roll 2d6.

01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:56.280
And success.
SAM: This time, it was

01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:57.510
a one and a four!

01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:58.420
MATT: There you go.

01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:01.530
SAM: Five points.

01:59:01.530 --> 01:59:03.133
Doubled, I'm assuming.

01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:07.531
Because they're ice.

01:59:07.531 --> 01:59:09.510
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh)

01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:11.718
SAM: They're vulnerable to fire, maybe?

01:59:11.718 --> 01:59:14.093
MATT: So you watch as they burn in the proximity of it.

01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:17.960
Not a high fire damage, but nevertheless, it hurts them.

01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.530
It hurts them.

01:59:19.530 --> 01:59:22.440
All right, so now, it's their turn.

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.600
That's two against you, Jester.

01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:27.132
LAURA: Yeah.

01:59:27.132 --> 01:59:29.365
SAM: Two against you.
MATT: That is 20 to hit.

01:59:29.365 --> 01:59:31.470
LAURA: (scoffs) Yeah.

01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:32.974
MATT: And 21 to hit.

01:59:32.974 --> 01:59:34.657
TALESIN: Mm.
LAURA: (dejected) Yeah.

01:59:34.657 --> 01:59:35.500
SAM: Aww!

01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:37.833
MATT: As they swing towards you,

01:59:41.276 --> 01:59:42.310
16 points of cold damage

01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:45.335
reduced to eight, and...

01:59:47.850 --> 01:59:49.800
17 points of cold damage reduced eight,

01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:52.317
so 16 total on that one.

01:59:52.317 --> 01:59:53.763
TALIESIN: Ah, fuck, man.

01:59:53.763 --> 01:59:56.855
MATT: These all swarm in on Caduceus here.

01:59:56.855 --> 01:59:57.910
LAURA: Let's all just go to sleep

01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:59.940
after this!
TALIESIN: They're also half-speed,

01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:01.380
if that matters.
MATT: Indeed,

02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:03.441
but it doesn't matter, unfortunately, because you're

02:00:03.441 --> 02:00:04.435
still pretty close.

02:00:04.435 --> 02:00:06.180
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:07.080
MATT: And he flies.

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:08.550
TRAVIS: Where you at, Cad?

02:00:09.846 --> 02:00:12.254
TRAVIS: What number are you at?
TALIESIN: 67.

02:00:12.254 --> 02:00:13.370
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: But this is about

02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:15.505
to be brutal, unless he rolls really poorly.

02:00:15.505 --> 02:00:18.005
SAM: ♪ (sings to background music) ♪

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:21.583
MATT: 12. That misses.
TALIESIN: No.

02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:24.730
MATT: 15?
TALIESIN: No.

02:00:24.730 --> 02:00:27.710
LAURA: Wow, you got the shitty ones around you.

02:00:27.710 --> 02:00:29.152
MATT: 21?
TALIESIN: Hits.

02:00:29.152 --> 02:00:30.716
LAURA: Shit. Sorry!
TALIESIN: Shh, you did that.

02:00:30.716 --> 02:00:32.210
MATT: (laughs)

02:00:32.210 --> 02:00:33.210
SAM: Don't worry, he's fine!

02:00:33.210 --> 02:00:35.310
MATT: 23 points of cold damage.
SAM: Ooh.

02:00:36.277 --> 02:00:38.124
MATT: And natural 20.

02:00:38.124 --> 02:00:39.610
(groaning)
TALIESIN: I cancel!

02:00:39.610 --> 02:00:40.782
MATT: As a reaction, you do cancel it.

02:00:40.782 --> 02:00:42.762
TRAVIS: Oh, lucky!
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:00:42.762 --> 02:00:43.830
LAURA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:46.660
MATT: Oh, and it's a good thing you did!

02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:48.026
24 points of cold damage.
TALIESIN: Yep, that would've

02:00:48.026 --> 02:00:48.859
been the end of me.

02:00:48.859 --> 02:00:50.050
TRAVIS: Wow!
SAM: Whoa!

02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:51.145
LAURA: You're down? You're down?
TRAVIS: No!

02:00:51.145 --> 02:00:52.174
LAURA: Caduceus is down?
TRAVIS: No!

02:00:52.174 --> 02:00:53.550
SAM: He's okay. He's okay.

02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:54.880
TRAVIS: Would've been.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I would've been

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.596
if I had not canceled that.

02:00:56.596 --> 02:00:57.744
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:00:57.744 --> 02:00:58.625
TRAVIS: Definitely would've been--

02:00:58.625 --> 02:00:59.751
MARISHA: But you're not looking good.

02:00:59.751 --> 02:01:01.120
MATT: Beauregard.
TALIESIN: When it hits my turn,

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:01.953
I might be down.
SAM: You're a cleric!

02:01:01.953 --> 02:01:03.460
MATT: You do have Patient Defense, so it has disadvantage

02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.051
on it's attack against you.
MARISHA: Correct.

02:01:05.051 --> 02:01:06.662
Am I also on fire, you said?

02:01:06.662 --> 02:01:08.453
SAM: ♪ This girl-- ♪
MARISHA: Or was it that I just burst

02:01:08.453 --> 02:01:09.907
into flame?
LIAM: ♪ Hotter than a fantasy ♪

02:01:09.907 --> 02:01:11.110
MATT: No, no, it was a burst--
TALIESIN: I could use a heal--

02:01:11.110 --> 02:01:12.750
MATT: -- of flame, then.
TALIESIN: -- on your next turn.

02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:16.140
MATT: So it rolled a natural 20 and a two, so it misses.

02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:17.248
MARISHA: Awesome.
LAURA: So the one

02:01:17.248 --> 02:01:19.560
that you hit Beau with didn't even catch on fire?

02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:21.240
SAM: ♪ This girl is on-- ♪

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:22.073
MATT: She caught on fire.

02:01:22.073 --> 02:01:23.672
LIAM: I bet she absorbed it instead.

02:01:23.672 --> 02:01:25.750
MATT: Exactly. You said he was sending it towards her.

02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:27.990
If she would've--
LIAM: Well, I was...

02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.900
I did great.

02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:29.849
MATT: You did great!

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:30.682
(laughter)

02:01:30.682 --> 02:01:33.720
She had a high chance of dodging it with her evasion,

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:35.680
so if she would've managed to succeed and evaded,

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:37.025
it was going to go and, so,

02:01:37.025 --> 02:01:38.133
that was my--
LIAM: Makes sense to me.

02:01:38.133 --> 02:01:39.442
That's why I said nothing.

02:01:39.442 --> 02:01:40.650
MARISHA: I rolled like shit.

02:01:40.650 --> 02:01:43.160
MATT: So, that finishes their go.
MARISHA: Terrible.

02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:44.770
MATT: Now that brings us to Yasha.

02:01:44.770 --> 02:01:46.486
ASHLEY: Okay, so--
MATT: Yasha, top of your turn.

02:01:46.486 --> 02:01:48.310
Because of the aura of there,

02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:50.830
you take five points of fire damage.

02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:53.200
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: Mm.

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:58.270
ASHLEY: Okay, so what I'm going to do--

02:01:58.270 --> 02:02:01.950
I'm going to start with letting out a battle cry,

02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:05.410
and everyone within 60 feet gains advantage

02:02:05.410 --> 02:02:07.024
on attack rolls and saving throws.

02:02:07.024 --> 02:02:08.340
SAM: What's that? What's that now?

02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:11.883
ASHLEY: So I don't know if it'll
reach. Bonuses on attack rolls--

02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:15.400
I'm sorry, advantages on attack rolls and saving throws.

02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:16.454
MARISHA: This is your battle cry?

02:02:16.454 --> 02:02:17.400
ASHLEY: This is battle cry.

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:19.260
MATT: It reaches you. It does not reach you.

02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:20.261
SAM: Yeah!
MATT: And everyone else

02:02:20.261 --> 02:02:21.890
gets advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:22.790
SAM: Woo!
TALIESIN: Fuck!

02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:27.020
ASHLEY: Okay, and then I'm going
to attack the one closest to me.

02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:28.603
MATT: Go for it.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:33.726
Ooh, 25?
MATT: 25 hits!

02:02:33.726 --> 02:02:34.670
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:02:38.328 --> 02:02:39.494
Savage Attacker.

02:02:39.494 --> 02:02:41.940
SAM: ♪ (sings to background music) ♪

02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:43.063
ASHLEY: That's a little better.

02:02:48.187 --> 02:02:49.580
28 points of damage

02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:51.350
for the first attack.
MATT: 28, nice.

02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:54.908
You take seven points of cold damage
as the energy blasts back

02:02:54.908 --> 02:02:56.327
from your melee attack against it.

02:02:56.327 --> 02:02:59.740
ASHLEY: (exhales) Okay, second attack

02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:01.347
is a natural 20.

02:03:01.347 --> 02:03:02.472
MARISHA: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

02:03:02.472 --> 02:03:04.097
MATT: Roll damage.
TALIESIN: End it.

02:03:08.290 --> 02:03:10.950
Seven, so 14.
TALIESIN: Bonus dice for that?

02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:12.723
Oh, wow, losing my voice. I'm going away.

02:03:12.723 --> 02:03:14.268
ASHLEY: So just the dice, or--

02:03:14.268 --> 02:03:16.993
MATT: Just the dice double.
ASHLEY: Okay, so...

02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:23.438
LAURA: At least we [inaudible].

02:03:23.438 --> 02:03:25.620
ASHLEY: Okay, so 27 total.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I may go down hard.

02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:28.430
MATT: 28 and 27. That's over 50
points of damage in one round.

02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:29.430
That's great.
ASHLEY: (exhales)

02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:30.930
MATT: You do take eight points of cold damage

02:03:30.930 --> 02:03:32.000
from the second strike.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.430
ASHLEY: Oh boy.
MATT: And as you,

02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:35.430
with the second blow, the sword swings wide,

02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:36.750
and you (grunts) feel the pain,

02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:39.490
but look up and watch as the creature is no more.

02:03:39.490 --> 02:03:42.500
It is scattered in a spray of snow and ice chips

02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:44.273
in the direction of Caleb,

02:03:44.273 --> 02:03:46.100
(whooshing) spraying the front of him slightly.

02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.270
TRAVIS: Ice chips.

02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:48.570
MATT: You can still move if you'd like.

02:03:48.570 --> 02:03:49.403
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:55.610
Boy, I feel like there's a lot going on

02:03:55.610 --> 02:03:59.250
over by Caduceus and Jester.

02:03:59.250 --> 02:04:00.800
Wait, which is the real Jester?

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:04.232
Which is the duplicate?
LIAM: The one by the door.

02:04:04.232 --> 02:04:05.065
LAURA: The real me!
LIAM: Downstage.

02:04:05.065 --> 02:04:06.440
SAM: Ask both a question that only Jester

02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:08.029
would know the answer to.
ASHLEY: (laughing) That's true.

02:04:08.029 --> 02:04:10.350
LIAM: One of us only lies!
ASHLEY: I'm going to move

02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:13.800
a little closer to, but right out of range

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:16.700
of the little ice creature, just ready to attack.

02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:18.290
MATT: So stay put?

02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:19.123
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay put.

02:04:19.123 --> 02:04:20.780
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:23.000
All right, that finishes your go, Yasha?

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.066
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Beauregard, you're up.

02:04:24.066 --> 02:04:25.083
Caduceus, you're on deck.

02:04:25.083 --> 02:04:26.270
MARISHA: I don't think I can do anything

02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:27.860
to light this brazier, so I'm going to

02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:30.170
turn around and--
MATT: You do take three points

02:04:30.170 --> 02:04:32.780
of cold damage from being in the proximity of its aura.

02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:35.083
MARISHA: I take three points of ice damage,

02:04:36.330 --> 02:04:39.030
and then I'm going to do just big-- two sweeping swings

02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:41.910
with my Belaborer.

02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:43.430
I have advantage on these, don't I?

02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:44.460
MATT: You do.
MARISHA: Thank god,

02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:46.110
because one's a one.

02:04:46.110 --> 02:04:49.390
So 26 for the first one.
MATT: That hits.

02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:52.760
MARISHA: And 28 for the second.

02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:54.160
MATT: That hits. Roll damage on each.

02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:56.402
LIAM: Try to get him out of there.

02:04:56.402 --> 02:04:57.997
SAM: How do we get Caduceus out of there?

02:04:57.997 --> 02:04:59.762
LIAM: And we lift him out, he's going to get hit--

02:04:59.762 --> 02:05:00.595
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to be dead next round.

02:05:00.595 --> 02:05:03.661
SAM: Do you have a transportation type of spell?

02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:06.080
TALIESIN: I won't have time. I'm going to drop instantly.

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:06.913
SAM: But it's your turn!

02:05:06.913 --> 02:05:09.266
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop immediately on my turn.

02:05:09.266 --> 02:05:11.100
MARISHA: 10 and 12 damage.
TALIESIN: I'm out.

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:11.983
MATT: 10 and 12?
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:05:11.983 --> 02:05:13.483
LAURA: --before they get to go again.

02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.220
TALIESIN: I'm in aura. I'm out.
MATT: You do take

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:18.800
an additional eight points of cold damage

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:20.593
from the two strikes, but--

02:05:20.593 --> 02:05:21.960
MARISHA: Even with my staff?

02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:23.880
MATT: Even with your staff, but you do destroy

02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:26.120
with those final hits.
MARISHA: Oh!

02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:27.850
MATT: They'd taken quite a few hits previously,

02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:29.490
so as you slam it both with the staff,

02:05:29.490 --> 02:05:31.510
a second one sends it flying into the far wall,

02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:34.150
where it (shatters) just breaks into a thousand pieces.

02:05:34.150 --> 02:05:38.110
MARISHA: In that case, I'll move, and bonus action

02:05:38.110 --> 02:05:41.011
Flurry of Blows the one that's harassing Caduceus.

02:05:41.011 --> 02:05:42.730
MATT: Over here?
MARISHA: Whichever one feels

02:05:42.730 --> 02:05:44.500
like it's most harassing Caduceus.

02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:47.283
MATT: They're all pretty much most harassing Caduceus.

02:05:47.283 --> 02:05:49.460
All right, moving into that aura is a new cold aura.

02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:51.380
You take another one point of cold damage.

02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:52.884
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Bonus action:

02:05:52.884 --> 02:05:54.779
two more strikes against it.

02:05:54.779 --> 02:05:56.627
MARISHA: (grunting) Pop, pop, pop!

02:05:57.777 --> 02:05:58.920
Still at advantage?

02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:01.630
So 21 for the first one.

02:06:01.630 --> 02:06:02.463
MATT: 21.

02:06:02.463 --> 02:06:05.404
MARISHA: And 21 again.
MATT: Both hits.

02:06:05.404 --> 02:06:08.030
MARISHA: No, sorry, 22.

02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.972
Whatever, never mind.

02:06:08.972 --> 02:06:11.525
MATT: Well, so the first one--

02:06:11.525 --> 02:06:12.810
those are to hit, right?
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:06:12.810 --> 02:06:15.140
MATT: Roll damage for the first one.

02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:18.980
MARISHA: Okay. Wait, not those, not those.

02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:21.600
For the first one?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:25.420
MARISHA: Okay, 13, 14.

02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:27.350
MATT: You take four points of cold damage from the impact,

02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:29.450
but this one, which was already barely holding on

02:06:29.450 --> 02:06:32.490
because of Caleb's spell earlier, shatters at the blow.

02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:33.640
TALIESIN: I may live.
MARISHA: Great.

02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:37.410
Four damage? So my second one,

02:06:37.410 --> 02:06:39.080
can I attack the one that's

02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:40.240
on the other side of me?
MATT: You can continue to move

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.320
and come in for this one if you want to, or this one.

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:44.240
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll do that one
that's on the other side of me,

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:45.553
the one that, yes, yes, yes.

02:06:45.553 --> 02:06:47.400
MATT: You got it.

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:52.400
MARISHA: Just full-on superhero-style punching through ice.

02:06:52.530 --> 02:06:55.570
Yeah, that's a natural 18, so 30.

02:06:55.570 --> 02:06:56.747
No, sorry, 28, 28.

02:06:56.747 --> 02:06:58.288
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.
MARISHA: I'm not attacking with my staff.

02:06:58.288 --> 02:07:00.754
MATT: Because you're not moving, you're technically

02:07:00.754 --> 02:07:02.069
not moving more than half your movement,

02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.960
so you don't have to make

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:04.480
a dex save to try and maintain your footing.

02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.440
MARISHA: Terrible damage, seven on that one.

02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:07.612
MATT: Seven damage on that one, all right.

02:07:07.612 --> 02:07:10.640
MARISHA: And Extract Aspects.

02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:12.270
MATT: Good call. You do take four points

02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:13.510
of cold damage from the impact.

02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:14.420
MARISHA: Okay.

02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:16.311
MATT: They are resistant

02:07:16.311 --> 02:07:18.804
to nonmagical slashing and piercing.

02:07:18.804 --> 02:07:20.288
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: They are immune

02:07:20.288 --> 02:07:24.050
to cold and poison damage and vulnerable to fire damage.

02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:26.663
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, that all tracks.

02:07:26.663 --> 02:07:30.471
SAM: Oh, fire damage was just doing so much more!

02:07:30.471 --> 02:07:32.367
MATT: It was doubling. You were just rolling really shitty.

02:07:32.367 --> 02:07:34.600
(laughter)

02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:36.600
MARISHA: Fire is bad. Everyone knows that.

02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:38.500
Everyone knows that!

02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:40.335
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: Hey.

02:07:40.335 --> 02:07:43.289
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: But it's really helpful to know!

02:07:43.289 --> 02:07:47.150
MARISHA: Thanks. Thanks.

02:07:47.150 --> 02:07:48.290
That's my turn.
SAM: Come on, Caduce.

02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:51.050
MATT: All righty. Caduceus, beginning of your round.

02:07:51.050 --> 02:07:52.210
SAM: See what happens.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:53.055
MATT: You take

02:07:53.963 --> 02:07:56.554
one point of cold damage from one aura,

02:07:56.554 --> 02:07:58.560
eight from another,

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:01.310
and then six, so one,

02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:03.510
then eight, so nine total.

02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:05.196
Are you still up?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:08:05.196 --> 02:08:07.043
MATT: Then the six addition to that, so 14 total.

02:08:07.043 --> 02:08:08.050
TALIESIN: I am still up.

02:08:08.050 --> 02:08:08.883
MATT: All righty!

02:08:08.883 --> 02:08:11.774
TALIESIN: 14, thank you for knocking that out!

02:08:11.774 --> 02:08:13.740
MARISHA: Just the one made the difference?
TALIESIN: Because that

02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:15.130
would've fucking done me.

02:08:15.130 --> 02:08:18.005
I'm at six hit points. So yeah.

02:08:19.042 --> 02:08:22.092
Okay.

02:08:25.862 --> 02:08:26.754
MARISHA: Wow.

02:08:26.754 --> 02:08:29.860
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- okay, the wound closure,

02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:32.790
do you use-- I can't remember. If I use Cure Wounds,

02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:37.790
that doesn't use my healing,

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:40.370
the-- oh god, sorry, hold on.

02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:41.407
MATT: Look at your parapet again.

02:08:41.407 --> 02:08:42.853
MARISHA: Your parapet situation?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:48.090
This is my brain. That doesn't use my--

02:08:48.090 --> 02:08:49.590
MATT: No, when you roll a hit dice, you get hit points.

02:08:49.590 --> 02:08:50.785
That's during a short rest.

02:08:50.785 --> 02:08:51.950
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's just--
MATT: So it doesn't affect

02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:53.161
actually magical healing.

02:08:53.161 --> 02:08:55.340
TALIESIN: Okay, that's okay.

02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:59.223
I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at--

02:08:59.223 --> 02:09:00.239
LIAM: Periapt.

02:09:01.890 --> 02:09:04.830
TALIESIN: Let's do a 4th-level Cure Wounds.

02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:06.960
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: For fun, so.

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.603
MATT: 4d8 plus five, go for it.

02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:13.777
TALIESIN: Maybe I'll roll a better 4d8 than I have been.

02:09:15.601 --> 02:09:16.572
Eh.

02:09:20.554 --> 02:09:23.990
I'm 20 points back, so a little better than before.

02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.823
MATT: There you go.

02:09:27.630 --> 02:09:30.030
TALIESIN: And that's pretty much what I can do,

02:09:30.030 --> 02:09:32.220
so I'm just going to-- I ain't moving anymore.

02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:35.110
I'm just going to stay put and hope this all ends.

02:09:35.110 --> 02:09:35.943
MATT: Fair enough.

02:09:35.943 --> 02:09:38.230
If you could, make three concentration checks

02:09:38.230 --> 02:09:40.230
for me, please, to maintain

02:09:40.230 --> 02:09:41.500
your Spirit Guardians.
ASHLEY: You have advantage

02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:43.190
on saving throws.
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

02:09:43.190 --> 02:09:46.709
Oh, I already have advantage on concentration checks anyway.

02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:47.667
TRAVIS: Good thing.

02:09:47.667 --> 02:09:49.220
TALIESIN: Saves or checks?

02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:50.840
MATT: Checks, or it's a saving throw, so whatever

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:53.926
your constitution saving throw is.

02:09:53.926 --> 02:09:56.509
TALIESIN: 13.
MATT: All right, you maintain.

02:09:58.130 --> 02:09:59.790
TALIESIN: 22.

02:09:59.790 --> 02:10:02.830
MATT: Maintain.

02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:04.913
TALIESIN: Nine?
MATT: No.

02:10:04.913 --> 02:10:06.350
TALIESIN: Fuck!

02:10:08.814 --> 02:10:09.813
LAURA: Fuck.

02:10:11.738 --> 02:10:13.029
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

02:10:13.029 --> 02:10:14.810
MATT: All right, that finish your go?
MARISHA: Dang.

02:10:14.810 --> 02:10:17.473
TALIESIN: I mean, in more ways than one, yeah.

02:10:17.473 --> 02:10:19.840
(laughter)

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:21.217
MATT: Veth, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

02:10:21.217 --> 02:10:22.742
LIAM: Yes, sir.
ASHLEY: Wow.

02:10:22.742 --> 02:10:25.220
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laughing)

02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:27.336
SAM: So, before Caduceus' next turn,

02:10:28.428 --> 02:10:31.210
they're going to get a go,

02:10:31.210 --> 02:10:34.248
and Beauregard's going to get a go.

02:10:34.248 --> 02:10:35.523
MARISHA: Mm-mm.
SAM: No.

02:10:35.523 --> 02:10:36.573
MARISHA: Jester will get a go.

02:10:36.573 --> 02:10:37.870
And then they--
SAM: Is that real Jester

02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:38.870
or fake Jester?
TALIESIN: It's fake Jester.

02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:40.044
SAM: Oh, and Fjord.
LAURA: It doesn't matter.

02:10:40.044 --> 02:10:41.594
I can cast spells from my fake.

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:46.440
SAM: Okay, I will-- just because I--

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:50.273
MATT: By the way, is your duplicate concentration?

02:10:52.552 --> 02:10:54.170
LAURA: Yes.

02:10:54.170 --> 02:10:57.130
MATT: Much easier to keep track of
which one the real Jester is

02:10:57.130 --> 02:10:58.900
because with the Spiritual Guardians up,

02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:00.741
the duplicate is gone.

02:11:00.741 --> 02:11:03.094
LAURA: That's a good point.

02:11:03.094 --> 02:11:04.069
MATT: Sorry.
LAURA: That was a--

02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:05.300
TRAVIS: Still good, still good.

02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:06.207
SAM: We're fine. We're fine.

02:11:06.207 --> 02:11:07.040
LIAM: Absolutely.
LAURA: Fuck!

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:08.523
TALIESIN: You could eventually run over here, too,

02:11:08.523 --> 02:11:10.673
and then--
LAURA: I will, if I can.

02:11:10.673 --> 02:11:12.270
TALIESIN: You can't.
LAURA: I can climb the rope,

02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:13.510
maybe, and get uphill.

02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:15.570
It's uphill, so it'll be difficult.

02:11:15.570 --> 02:11:16.470
TALIESIN: It's a slope.

02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:19.080
SAM: I will-- just because I like

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:24.080
this rope so much, I'm going to hang on it with my knees.

02:11:24.253 --> 02:11:26.074
MATT: Well, who's holding the rope up here, by the way?

02:11:26.074 --> 02:11:28.028
TRAVIS: What's up?
MATT: Are you holding the rope up there?

02:11:28.028 --> 02:11:29.289
TRAVIS: I'm staying up at the top, yeah.

02:11:29.289 --> 02:11:30.634
MATT: Yeah.

02:11:30.634 --> 02:11:33.849
SAM: Sure, I'm going to hang on it with my knees like that,

02:11:33.849 --> 02:11:36.814
upside down, and shooting the thing.

02:11:36.814 --> 02:11:38.342
MATT: Okay.

02:11:38.342 --> 02:11:39.640
LAURA: I like that we're battling all these things

02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:41.285
and still, like, I'm-- (grunts)

02:11:41.285 --> 02:11:42.118
(laughter)

02:11:42.118 --> 02:11:44.640
SAM: Hold it steady, guys!

02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:47.323
And you know what, I will throw a knife instead of

02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:51.200
the thingy.
MATT: Okay.

02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:52.033
Who you throwing it at?

02:11:52.033 --> 02:11:53.970
SAM: I'll throw it at the one closest to me.

02:11:53.970 --> 02:11:55.660
MATT: Right there? Go for it. Roll for the attack.

02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:59.530
SAM: With advantage.
MATT: With advantage. (whooshing)

02:11:59.530 --> 02:12:01.860
SAM: 18 plus stuff, so it's got to hit.

02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:03.603
MATT: That hits. You can go ahead and roll damage.

02:12:03.603 --> 02:12:04.746
SAM: And--
MATT: And it is sneak attack

02:12:04.746 --> 02:12:05.750
because you had advantage on the attack roll.

02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:06.583
SAM: Yeah.

02:12:06.583 --> 02:12:08.441
MATT: And next to Caduceus, regardless.

02:12:09.503 --> 02:12:12.670
SAM: Okay. (counting)

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:18.063
25 plus

02:12:19.418 --> 02:12:23.050
six is 31, plus I will pump

02:12:23.050 --> 02:12:25.863
an extra 3d6 into it.
MATT: Sure.

02:12:25.863 --> 02:12:27.530
LAURA: (whispering) You're still good.

02:12:30.170 --> 02:12:32.370
SAM: 38 points of damage.

02:12:32.370 --> 02:12:33.813
MATT: 38 points of damage.

02:12:35.540 --> 02:12:37.480
The dagger strikes it, and you watch for a moment

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:39.360
as it lodges itself in the center

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:41.750
of this throbbing blue energy,

02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:44.420
and the crystal just shatters

02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:45.830
all across the chamber floor.

02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:48.720
The dagger plummets, then slides

02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:50.850
down the bottom of the floor--
SAM: Oh no!

02:12:50.850 --> 02:12:53.282
MATT: -- towards the other door.
SAM: No, no, no! (laughs)

02:12:53.282 --> 02:12:55.050
TRAVIS: (hissing)

02:12:55.050 --> 02:12:56.090
MATT: That's your action.
SAM: On bonus action,

02:12:56.090 --> 02:12:59.810
I'll charge with my Flaming Sphere

02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:01.002
at the other one.

02:13:01.002 --> 02:13:02.393
MARISHA: Get it.
MATT: Hit a side there.

02:13:02.393 --> 02:13:04.140
As it rolls across the ground,

02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:08.007
slamming into the crystal entity, it fails its save.

02:13:08.007 --> 02:13:10.200
(laughs) So 2d6.

02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:12.477
SAM: Four points of damage!

02:13:12.477 --> 02:13:13.310
MATT: Up to eight.

02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:16.055
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs)

02:13:16.055 --> 02:13:17.838
TRAVIS: What is it, 2d4?

02:13:17.838 --> 02:13:18.720
SAM: It's 2d6.

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:21.790
I just keep rolling terribly.

02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:24.590
MATT: All righty. (laughs)
SAM: Does the Flaming Sphere--

02:13:24.590 --> 02:13:28.590
does it catch the USB cord on fire, or am I okay?

02:13:28.590 --> 02:13:29.423
MATT: It will in a couple rounds.

02:13:29.423 --> 02:13:30.836
SAM: Okay, cool. (laughs)

02:13:30.836 --> 02:13:32.113
MARISHA: It's insulated, you know.

02:13:32.113 --> 02:13:34.371
It's got, it's good, yeah.
TRAVIS: Latched in.

02:13:34.371 --> 02:13:35.380
MARISHA: It's great.
TALIESIN: You could move it.

02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:37.370
No, never mind. Oh, okay.

02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:39.136
MATT: All right, so, that finishes your go.

02:13:39.136 --> 02:13:41.030
Caleb, you're up.
LIAM: I'm going to finish what I started.

02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:43.710
I raise the cat's cradle up, and I spin my finger around

02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:45.430
and wrap it up tighter in string and bring it

02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:48.060
right back down and cast at 5th-level,

02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:51.830
and I will send one of the snakes to the final brazier

02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:54.620
and hit every last creature on the map

02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:56.070
because there's four of them.

02:13:56.070 --> 02:13:57.593
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's five targets.

02:13:57.593 --> 02:14:00.698
SAM: (poofing)

02:14:00.698 --> 02:14:03.532
MATT: That one alights, and then roll damage for the other.

02:14:03.532 --> 02:14:05.890
LIAM: Yep, eight, so that's 9d6.

02:14:05.890 --> 02:14:07.940
MATT: Failed save.

02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:09.473
Failed save.

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:13.288
Success, and success.

02:14:15.570 --> 02:14:17.436
LIAM: It's 28 total.

02:14:17.436 --> 02:14:19.512
MATT: So they both take it.

02:14:19.512 --> 02:14:20.987
LAURA: So that's what, 52?

02:14:22.042 --> 02:14:24.625
No, 56?
LIAM: 56.

02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:28.873
LAURA: Wow.

02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:34.542
MATT: Both of them just shatter and melt in midair.

02:14:34.542 --> 02:14:37.400
You hear the explosion, and there's just a mist left behind

02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:39.110
as immediately, the ice is turned to vapor

02:14:39.110 --> 02:14:40.590
and this small cloud of fog, where they both

02:14:40.590 --> 02:14:42.870
just shriek.

02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:45.303
No longer exist to the right of you and Jester.

02:14:46.630 --> 02:14:47.907
You did at the top of your round

02:14:47.907 --> 02:14:48.980
take one point

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:50.250
of cold damage from proximity to one

02:14:50.250 --> 02:14:52.965
of them, just as a note.

02:14:52.965 --> 02:14:54.600
The other two impact

02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:57.070
and are extremely hurt.

02:14:57.070 --> 02:14:58.060
They are barely holding on.

02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:00.170
They have no seemingly intellect of their own,

02:15:00.170 --> 02:15:01.010
so they're not looking to flee.

02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:01.910
They don't have a sense of self.

02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:03.730
They are just hungry for heat.

02:15:03.730 --> 02:15:05.990
As the last brazier lights, (whooshes)

02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:08.720
the doors behind you and Jester (whooshes)--

02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:10.220
LAURA: (gasps) Uh oh!
MATT: -- open up, the two

02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:11.640
that you are leaning against.

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:14.233
I need you both to make dexterity saving throws for me.

02:15:14.233 --> 02:15:15.230
LAURA: Oops!

02:15:15.230 --> 02:15:16.910
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Oh, advantage!

02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:18.072
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15:18.072 --> 02:15:20.676
MATT: Yeah, you do have dex saves.
MARISHA: Tight, tight, tight, tight.

02:15:20.676 --> 02:15:23.180
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:15:23.180 --> 02:15:25.372
21 for me.
MATT: All righty.

02:15:25.372 --> 02:15:27.370
MARISHA: Remember that scene in the Titanic?

02:15:27.370 --> 02:15:28.888
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.
LIAM: 15 for me.

02:15:28.888 --> 02:15:31.080
TRAVIS: (imitates violin)
MARISHA: (sliding)

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:33.170
LIAM: If I fail, I'll succeed it with the ring.

02:15:33.170 --> 02:15:34.003
MATT: You do fail.

02:15:34.003 --> 02:15:35.500
LIAM: Okay, so I use the Ring of Evasion.

02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:38.190
ASHLEY: Is there any way I can--
MATT: So you do succeed, okay.

02:15:38.190 --> 02:15:40.462
You both barely manage to move to the sides.

02:15:40.462 --> 02:15:41.910
LAURA: Well, I'm holding onto the rope,

02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:45.870
so I'm assuming (laughs) Fjord probably gets yanked.
SAM: (yelping)

02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:46.703
TRAVIS: (yelps)

02:15:46.703 --> 02:15:49.180
MATT: Oh god, there you go.
TALIESIN: Yay!

02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:51.789
TRAVIS: I'm strong. I-- (shrieks)

02:15:51.789 --> 02:15:53.610
MATT: You both--

02:15:53.610 --> 02:15:55.920
LIAM: You just clench your glutes and hold the rope?

02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:57.403
MATT: Just shift over to the side.

02:15:57.403 --> 02:15:58.367
You hold the rope and pull off the end,

02:15:58.367 --> 02:16:00.470
and the door opens to the left of you.

02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:02.680
You both manage to prevent just falling

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:03.629
into the next chamber.

02:16:03.629 --> 02:16:05.880
LIAM: (laughs) That was close.

02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:06.963
MATT: All righty.

02:16:08.386 --> 02:16:10.620
That finishes Caleb's go.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:12.143
MATT: You can move if you'd like to.

02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:16.240
LIAM: I will move just maybe five
or 10 more feet to the left,

02:16:17.376 --> 02:16:18.800
so I don't fall in.

02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:21.520
MATT: Fair enough. That brings us
to Fjord. Fjord, you're up.

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:23.360
TRAVIS: Yeah, my dexterity's not so great,

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:27.020
and doors are opening and shit at the bottom of the room.

02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:28.770
You know, like when you go tubing,

02:16:28.770 --> 02:16:31.120
you can kind of aim where you want to go?

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:32.030
MATT: Yeah?
LIAM: Yeah!

02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:34.460
TRAVIS: Can I try and, like, jump and slide,

02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:37.300
so I'll slide right towards where Caduceus is?

02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:38.140
MATT: We can certainly try.

02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:40.460
TRAVIS: I will try and kaplinko my way down

02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:42.770
to Caduceus.

02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:43.603
MATT: I dig it.

02:16:43.603 --> 02:16:45.961
To get right where Caduceus is, you will be passing by Veth.

02:16:45.961 --> 02:16:47.060
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: Okay!

02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:48.368
SAM: You've also dropped the rope,

02:16:48.368 --> 02:16:49.387
I assume?
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck that rope.

02:16:49.387 --> 02:16:50.220
SAM: (surprised yell)

02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:51.053
(laughter)

02:16:51.053 --> 02:16:52.643
MATT: So you don't need to worry about that.

02:16:52.643 --> 02:16:55.715
Veth, make a dexterity check for me.
SAM: Check?

02:16:55.715 --> 02:16:57.360
MATT: A dexterity saving throw. I
would say with disadvantage

02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:58.193
because you weren't expecting it,

02:16:58.193 --> 02:16:59.990
but you have an advantage, so it's just a straight roll.

02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:01.145
SAM: Natural one.

02:17:01.145 --> 02:17:03.265
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Oh!

02:17:03.265 --> 02:17:06.177
MARISHA: No!
MATT: Veth. (whooshing)

02:17:06.177 --> 02:17:08.297
SAM: (screams)

02:17:09.139 --> 02:17:12.000
LAURA: I've still got the rope on the other end!

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:15.320
MATT: You do, but she's now just gliding off like this

02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:16.773
because you're holding one end of the rope.

02:17:16.773 --> 02:17:18.117
SAM: (screams)
MATT: So are you holding on to--

02:17:18.117 --> 02:17:20.670
she holds onto the rope, so you go falling out the side,

02:17:20.670 --> 02:17:22.350
but are you still holding the rope?

02:17:22.350 --> 02:17:23.374
SAM: No!
LAURA: No, you're not

02:17:23.374 --> 02:17:24.440
going to hold onto it?
MATT: You let go of the rope?

02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:26.430
SAM: I was never holding the rope. My legs were on it.

02:17:26.430 --> 02:17:27.263
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs)
LAURA: So you're still, like--

02:17:27.263 --> 02:17:28.930
MATT: That's right. Then, I'll tell you what:

02:17:28.930 --> 02:17:30.823
as you and the rope go sliding by,

02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:35.460
roll a d20 for me.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:36.940
LIAM: And the rope is going-- (whirs)

02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:40.590
LAURA: Yeah, just tangling back up.
SAM: Two! (laughs)

02:17:40.590 --> 02:17:41.760
LAURA: Yeah, I know. Can we try to catch her?

02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:43.980
ASHLEY: Or grab her on the way down?

02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:46.090
LAURA: That's like a reaction.
ASHLEY: Because I'm right there?

02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:48.490
MATT: I can't give you guys 16 different reactions,

02:17:48.490 --> 02:17:51.410
and when it's, like, three rolls have failed in a row here.

02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:53.540
LIAM: (like Sean Connery) Indiana, let it go.
MATT: Yeah.

02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:55.503
TRAVIS: Let it go.
ASHLEY: Let it go.

02:17:55.503 --> 02:17:58.125
MATT: Veth just slides into the next chamber.

02:17:58.125 --> 02:17:59.267
SAM: (surprised shout)

02:17:59.267 --> 02:18:00.620
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:04.083
SAM: Do I catch my knife on the way? (laughs)

02:18:04.083 --> 02:18:05.341
MATT: We'll get to you in a second.
SAM: Okay.

02:18:05.341 --> 02:18:06.357
(laughter)

02:18:06.357 --> 02:18:08.053
MATT: Fjord, what are you doing?
You trying to scoot this way?

02:18:08.053 --> 02:18:09.940
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm trying to slide
right down to where Caduceus is.

02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:12.415
MATT: Okay, make a dexterity check, not a saving throw.

02:18:12.415 --> 02:18:14.102
It's not a reaction.

02:18:14.102 --> 02:18:14.935
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:18:14.935 --> 02:18:16.010
MATT: But I will allow advantage

02:18:16.010 --> 02:18:19.243
on this because you are doing this
intentionally, and it's just sliding.

02:18:19.243 --> 02:18:20.110
TRAVIS: A dexterity check?

02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:21.440
MATT: Yes, you add your dexterity bonus.

02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:22.530
TALIESIN: With advantage. Everything should--

02:18:22.530 --> 02:18:24.790
Well, but, like, we have advantage on a ton of stuff.

02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:26.170
TRAVIS: 18, just an 18

02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:27.790
with no modifier.
MATT: Yeah, where you want to go?

02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:30.029
TRAVIS: Straight down to Caduceus.

02:18:30.029 --> 02:18:33.312
MATT: (whooshing) All right, so you are sliding past him.

02:18:33.312 --> 02:18:36.190
You will either bowl through Caduceus,

02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:38.050
or you can try and stop or go with him.

02:18:38.050 --> 02:18:41.270
TRAVIS: No, I literally want to give him a big-ass hug.

02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:43.020
I'm going to hit him, and when I hit him,

02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:44.611
I'm going to cast Thunder Step.

02:18:44.611 --> 02:18:46.303
LIAM: Boosh!
MATT: All righty!

02:18:46.303 --> 02:18:48.360
You do enter the frost radius

02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:50.090
of two of them when you do so,

02:18:50.090 --> 02:18:52.947
so you do take 14 points of cold damage.

02:18:52.947 --> 02:18:53.855
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:18:53.855 --> 02:18:55.363
MATT: As you slide into their space, but

02:18:55.363 --> 02:18:57.520
as you're scooting down, sending up ice bits

02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:00.190
and bits of rock and pebbles behind you,

02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:02.030
you reach out, scoop up Caduceus.

02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:04.505
You both go about to tumble as
you finish the spell, and then--

02:19:04.505 --> 02:19:05.346
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

02:19:05.346 --> 02:19:07.570
TRAVIS and MATT: (explosion)

02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:09.450
MATT: -- explode outward.

02:19:09.450 --> 02:19:11.058
The flaming sphere, I will say at this point

02:19:11.058 --> 02:19:14.080
because it's no longer in your sight, will dissipate.

02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:15.380
SAM: Sure, sure.

02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:17.020
MATT: So where do you two want to go?

02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:22.017
TRAVIS: I'm going to go to the
corner, down over here, right here.

02:19:22.017 --> 02:19:23.230
MATT: You both manage

02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:25.200
to stumble a bit and land against the wall,

02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:27.980
catching yourself, not quite falling completely over,

02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:30.400
using the edge of it to stop your momentum.

02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:32.203
It hurts. That shoulder's going to be sore in the morning.

02:19:32.203 --> 02:19:33.430
TALIESIN: Yep, everything's sore.

02:19:33.430 --> 02:19:35.690
MATT: But you're okay at the moment.

02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:37.010
How much damage do both of them take,

02:19:37.010 --> 02:19:38.843
and what's their save?

02:19:40.856 --> 02:19:43.650
TRAVIS: 21-- 21, 24,

02:19:43.650 --> 02:19:47.748
24 points of thunder damage, and it's a constitution 18.

02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:49.853
MATT: No,

02:19:51.170 --> 02:19:53.644
and yes.
MARISHA: Yes, damn.

02:19:53.644 --> 02:19:55.460
MATT: 24 to 12.

02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:57.420
They're already both pretty hurt,

02:19:57.420 --> 02:19:59.995
and so regardless of making its save,

02:19:59.995 --> 02:20:02.170
as you both vanish from sight,

02:20:02.170 --> 02:20:04.940
there's a brief moment where just, they go (whooshing),

02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:06.860
and the space where they were,

02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:09.740
suddenly (whooshing) impacts and then (explosion)

02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:13.180
detonates outward in this shockwave that sends all

02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:16.050
of their ice shards and essence just scattering

02:20:16.050 --> 02:20:18.570
across the room at enormous speed.

02:20:18.570 --> 02:20:21.250
The rest of you in the chamber have to protect yourself

02:20:21.250 --> 02:20:25.243
as you're suddenly pelted with tiny bits of broken ice,

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.310
and with that quiet moment, you realize

02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:31.680
that nothing else in the chamber beyond you

02:20:33.470 --> 02:20:36.733
seems to be moving, reacting.

02:20:36.733 --> 02:20:37.566
TRAVIS: Would I have hit you?

02:20:37.566 --> 02:20:40.091
LAURA: Yes!
TRAVIS: Would I have hit you also?

02:20:40.091 --> 02:20:41.650
MARISHA: I think you would've.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:42.483
LAURA: But what if you, like--

02:20:42.483 --> 02:20:43.740
MATT: That is within five feet, so yes,

02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:45.285
make a constitution saving throw.

02:20:45.285 --> 02:20:48.280
LAURA: You slid just down with Caduceus
and bamfed out when you were out

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:50.163
of close range?
MARISHA: I still have Battle Cry.

02:20:50.163 --> 02:20:51.913
MATT: You do.
TRAVIS: What?

02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:55.390
MARISHA: Natural 20.
ASHLEY: Ey!

02:20:55.390 --> 02:20:56.945
MATT: So you take 12 points of thunder damage.

02:20:56.945 --> 02:20:58.790
I think that's right, 'cause it was 24?

02:20:58.790 --> 02:21:01.570
TALIESIN: Maybe we should get into
the next room and take a minute.

02:21:01.570 --> 02:21:04.004
MATT: So Veth.
SAM: (yells)

02:21:04.004 --> 02:21:07.830
MATT: You slide into darkness, and where you are expecting

02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:08.995
a floor to meet you--

02:21:08.995 --> 02:21:10.620
LAURA: (gasps)

02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:11.737
MATT: You're free falling.

02:21:11.737 --> 02:21:13.538
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh, shit!

02:21:13.538 --> 02:21:15.940
MATT: And falling and falling.

02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:21.947
I need you to make-- just roll a d6 for me.

02:21:21.947 --> 02:21:23.005
SAM: Okay.

02:21:24.338 --> 02:21:25.920
Two.

02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:27.150
MATT: Two, okay.

02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:28.680
LAURA: Do you have anything?

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:29.823
SAM: I've got stuff.

02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:33.610
MATT: You fall for 50,

02:21:33.610 --> 02:21:35.980
60, 70 feet.
LIAM: What are you doing?

02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:38.320
MATT: You don't really see much around you

02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:40.608
because you don't have darkvision--
but you have the goggles on still, right?

02:21:40.608 --> 02:21:43.700
SAM: I do. I will at some point cast Feather Fall.

02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:45.310
MATT: Well, up to you.

02:21:45.310 --> 02:21:46.680
You've fallen for 70 feet at this point,

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:47.800
and looking around you, all you see

02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:50.822
is bits of jagged ice and stone-- (whooshing)

02:21:50.822 --> 02:21:52.848
SAM: I will cast Feather Fall.
MATT: Okay.

02:21:52.848 --> 02:21:54.514
(poofing)

02:21:54.514 --> 02:21:56.134
LIAM: No, better be sure.

02:21:56.134 --> 02:21:57.703
Wait another minute.
MATT: And you just slowly

02:21:57.703 --> 02:22:00.220
begin to drift for 80,

02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:02.689
90, 100,

02:22:02.689 --> 02:22:04.703
10, 120, 150,

02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:07.420
200 feet.
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

02:22:07.420 --> 02:22:09.030
MATT: 250 feet.
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:10.550
SAM: It doesn't last forever.

02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:13.470
MATT: At about 270-- you fall pretty fast, though.

02:22:13.470 --> 02:22:16.620
At about 270 feet, you begin to just barely see,

02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:20.372
rising up to you, the floor of this pit.

02:22:20.372 --> 02:22:23.670
LAURA: Oh my god.
MATT: You see broken

02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:26.550
bits of jagged stone walls and pillars

02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:29.810
that are like a spike trap at the bottom.

02:22:29.810 --> 02:22:32.720
Debris and elements of fallen architecture

02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:34.823
just litter the floor at the bottom of this pit,

02:22:34.823 --> 02:22:38.423
and you land on your feet gently, taking no damage.

02:22:38.423 --> 02:22:39.898
LAURA: (relieved) Ah!
SAM: (laughs)

02:22:39.898 --> 02:22:42.256
TRAVIS: I thought he was going to say lava.
"You took 75--", yeah.

02:22:42.256 --> 02:22:44.665
TALIESIN: If that had been literally anyone else--

02:22:44.665 --> 02:22:45.498
TRAVIS: Toast, toast.
MARISHA: Dead.

02:22:45.498 --> 02:22:47.114
TALIESIN: -- and done.

02:22:48.129 --> 02:22:49.690
Anybody else.
MATT: As soon as that rope went,

02:22:49.690 --> 02:22:51.190
I was, like, okay!

02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:52.870
LIAM: Spider-Man slide into dark.

02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:55.734
MATT: Yeah, hey--
SAM: No worries.

02:22:55.734 --> 02:22:59.041
ASHLEY: (shouting) Veth, are you okay?

02:22:59.041 --> 02:23:00.310
LAURA: Veth!
TALIESIN: Kay, kay, kay.

02:23:00.310 --> 02:23:01.520
SAM: I don't know. Can I even hear them?

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:03.600
That's far! Yeah, I can still hear them.

02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:05.356
MATT: You can hear them, yeah.

02:23:05.356 --> 02:23:07.213
SAM: (yells)

02:23:07.213 --> 02:23:08.046
ASHLEY: Are you hurt?

02:23:08.046 --> 02:23:10.050
SAM: (yelling) No, I'm okay!

02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:11.950
LIAM: I start sending the globules down

02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:14.053
just to get an idea of the space.

02:23:14.053 --> 02:23:15.094
MATT: No worries.

02:23:16.030 --> 02:23:20.907
As you peer over, you can see now a mostly collapsed chamber

02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:23.890
with jagged rock and ice punching through the top

02:23:23.890 --> 02:23:27.080
of what might have been once a beautiful structure,

02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:29.940
some sort of ceremonial interior,

02:23:29.940 --> 02:23:32.660
but the majority of it has tumbled inward,

02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:35.073
and the floor has bottomed out from underneath.

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:40.920
This 25 by 30-foot chamber area has no floor.

02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:44.010
All of it, all of whatever structure was there

02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:47.790
has fallen into this pit into endless darkness,

02:23:47.790 --> 02:23:51.530
and as you hear the faint echoes of Veth calling up to you,

02:23:51.530 --> 02:23:52.434
we're going to take a break.

02:23:52.434 --> 02:23:53.480
SAM: Ooh, good spot!

02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:55.210
TRAVIS: I'm going to hit you with a Cure Wounds.

02:23:55.210 --> 02:23:57.060
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a-- if we can take 10 minutes,

02:23:57.060 --> 02:24:00.270
I can also heal, give everybody who took damage

02:24:00.270 --> 02:24:01.702
a little bit of--
TRAVIS: Okay, we'll wait for that,

02:24:01.702 --> 02:24:02.730
after the break.
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:02.730 --> 02:24:05.680
LIAM: Fjord is the master of the drive-by Thunder Step.

02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:06.513
LAURA: Yep.

02:24:06.513 --> 02:24:07.890
MARISHA: Yeah, it's great.
LIAM: Moving target.

02:24:07.890 --> 02:24:09.993
MATT: I love it so much.

02:24:09.993 --> 02:24:11.459
It is, like, the hottest use of that spell.

02:24:11.459 --> 02:24:12.900
LIAM: (zooming) (poofing)

02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:14.845
TALIESIN: Oh, boy!
LIAM: (zooming) (poofing)

02:24:14.845 --> 02:24:16.412
TRAVIS: Heads up, heads up, heads up, heads up! (impact)

02:24:16.412 --> 02:24:18.870
(laughter)

02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:20.430
MATT: All righty, be back here in a few minutes,

02:24:20.430 --> 02:24:22.440
and we'll pick up from this scenario,

02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:23.640
and see where it goes from there.

02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:24.680
So see you guys in a minute!

02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:25.655
MARISHA: Lord, have mercy!

02:24:25.975 --> 02:24:28.695
Now experience the ultimate way to play

02:24:28.695 --> 02:24:31.685
by sitting in a table with your friends,

02:24:31.685 --> 02:24:34.975
with your face in a screen, progress!

02:24:34.975 --> 02:24:36.955
D&amp;D Beyond.

02:24:36.955 --> 02:24:40.905
Log in to explore strange worlds and fantastical cities.

02:24:40.905 --> 02:24:44.015
Thanks to a company based in a really boring one

02:24:44.015 --> 02:24:45.735
that handles all the tedious math

02:24:45.735 --> 02:24:47.185
and reference stuff for you.

02:24:47.185 --> 02:24:49.575
So you can finally unleash the epic quest

02:24:49.575 --> 02:24:52.465
you've been crafting since middle school on your friends.

02:24:52.465 --> 02:24:54.725
Or just do what most people use it for,

02:24:54.725 --> 02:24:56.345
cranking out endless new characters

02:24:56.345 --> 02:24:57.675
while they're bored at work.

02:24:57.675 --> 02:24:59.365
I could finish these spreadsheets,

02:24:59.365 --> 02:25:02.112
but what if this Paladin owned a horse?

02:25:02.112 --> 02:25:04.665
(uplifting music)

02:25:04.665 --> 02:25:05.825
Perfect.

02:25:05.825 --> 02:25:07.145
D&amp;D Beyond.

02:25:07.145 --> 02:25:09.678
Play with advantage

02:25:09.678 --> 02:25:12.511
(cinematic music)

02:25:40.415 --> 02:25:42.751
Yes, now they're drinking glizzys.

02:25:42.751 --> 02:25:44.245
What's a glizzy!?

02:25:44.245 --> 02:25:48.325
It very popular pop culture thing right now

02:25:48.325 --> 02:25:51.085
for people-
No, it's not. (laughing)

02:25:51.085 --> 02:25:53.835
To consume and talk about glizzys.

02:25:53.835 --> 02:25:57.145
This whole ad team just comes up with names with Zs in it.

02:25:57.145 --> 02:25:59.186
Try this out, a grizzy.

02:25:59.186 --> 02:26:01.158
(laughing)

02:26:01.158 --> 02:26:03.673
Hmm, okay, okay, don't like that one.

02:26:03.673 --> 02:26:05.255
How 'bout a whizzy?

02:26:05.255 --> 02:26:07.588
(laughing)

02:26:10.521 --> 02:26:13.104
(quirky music)

02:26:27.082 --> 02:26:28.625
I'm in the earliest stages

02:26:28.625 --> 02:26:30.488
of growing all my chest hair back, which I removed.

02:26:30.488 --> 02:26:33.085
Oh, interesting. (laughing)

02:26:33.085 --> 02:26:34.467
It's a shame you can't go swimming right now.

02:26:34.467 --> 02:26:36.075
Because Astrid's outfit was so low cut

02:26:36.075 --> 02:26:38.615
I didn't want to blow the illusion

02:26:38.615 --> 02:26:41.385
with my X-Men for-
Yeah, that's true.

02:26:41.385 --> 02:26:43.644
Yeah, you do have a nice, hairy chest.

02:26:43.644 --> 02:26:46.185
Hmm.
Fuzzy.

02:26:46.185 --> 02:26:47.145
We'll see what happens.

02:26:47.145 --> 02:26:49.412
I can't really show mine, but I can give you a little,

02:26:49.412 --> 02:26:52.955
you can see something.
Okay, all right.

02:26:52.955 --> 02:26:54.775
I'm trying to get this to attach here

02:26:54.775 --> 02:26:56.715
but I can't grow hair on my neck right here.

02:26:56.715 --> 02:26:57.665
Can you guys?

02:26:57.665 --> 02:26:59.149
I think you need an adapter for that.

02:26:59.149 --> 02:26:59.982
No.
Get like a nice

02:26:59.982 --> 02:27:01.705
thyroid mustache.

02:27:01.705 --> 02:27:04.135
I assume that your chest hair is just,

02:27:04.135 --> 02:27:06.828
is just manicured into the same shape as your goatee.

02:27:08.115 --> 02:27:09.125
With like a hole in the middle.

02:27:09.125 --> 02:27:10.245
Yeah, but it's upside down.

02:27:10.245 --> 02:27:11.078
Okay.

02:27:11.078 --> 02:27:13.505
So it's an upside down kind of smile on my chest.

02:27:13.505 --> 02:27:16.625
So when I look down, I'm smiling at myself via my hair.

02:27:16.625 --> 02:27:17.458
I mean, I've seen it.

02:27:17.458 --> 02:27:19.421
I saw you when you opened for The Fartiste that one time.

02:27:19.421 --> 02:27:21.688
(laughing)

02:27:21.688 --> 02:27:24.025
It was quite an act.
Ay, so I got this gig.

02:27:24.025 --> 02:27:25.881
They said if he can do that.

02:27:25.881 --> 02:27:27.845
(laughing)

02:27:27.845 --> 02:27:29.985
Hey, critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:27:29.985 --> 02:27:32.723
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:27:32.723 --> 02:27:34.385
(upbeat music)

02:27:34.385 --> 02:27:36.875
I mean, the traveler only says impulse purchases

02:27:36.875 --> 02:27:38.128
are a good decision.

02:27:40.695 --> 02:27:43.545
These holidays, you know, they're just around the corner.

02:27:45.685 --> 02:27:49.538
Rolling investigation if you want, it's basically perfect.

02:27:51.779 --> 02:27:54.598
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:27:56.872 --> 02:27:58.905
This is, this is a lot of stuff you guys,

02:27:58.905 --> 02:28:01.398
we have like so many cool things right now.

02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:05.922
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:28:05.922 --> 02:28:06.915
(laughing)

02:28:06.915 --> 02:28:08.815
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:28:08.815 --> 02:28:10.554
You still got time.

02:28:12.835 --> 02:28:17.225
(smooth jazz music)

02:28:17.225 --> 02:28:18.635
Hello, everyone.

02:28:18.635 --> 02:28:19.765
It's me.

02:28:19.765 --> 02:28:21.865
Marisha Ray, Creative director

02:28:21.865 --> 02:28:23.805
for Critical Role content.

02:28:23.805 --> 02:28:25.905
And I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

02:28:25.905 --> 02:28:28.985
about how much we appreciate your support.

02:28:28.985 --> 02:28:33.395
No frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

02:28:33.395 --> 02:28:34.545
Over the past five years

02:28:34.545 --> 02:28:37.245
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos

02:28:37.245 --> 02:28:40.309
in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:43.205
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor,

02:28:43.205 --> 02:28:46.705
cheap costumes, and putting our loyal employees

02:28:46.705 --> 02:28:48.555
in slightly embarrassing situations

02:28:48.555 --> 02:28:51.705
eagerly hoping that we've captured your attention.

02:28:51.705 --> 02:28:55.225
Today, I am not resorting to edge lords jokes

02:28:55.225 --> 02:28:57.775
written by Brian W. Foster

02:28:57.775 --> 02:29:00.705
or dressing Sam as a celebrity to recreate

02:29:00.705 --> 02:29:03.695
an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

02:29:03.695 --> 02:29:06.655
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account

02:29:06.655 --> 02:29:09.485
requires you to resubscribe each month.

02:29:09.485 --> 02:29:12.865
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

02:29:12.865 --> 02:29:14.895
or have to put Matt in cosplay

02:29:14.895 --> 02:29:17.645
to tell you that you can easily give subscriptions

02:29:17.645 --> 02:29:20.135
to fellow critters, if you're feeling generous.

02:29:20.135 --> 02:29:23.995
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days

02:29:23.995 --> 02:29:27.495
shooting complicated parody promos featuring Taliesin Jaffe

02:29:27.495 --> 02:29:29.005
as a vintage spooky boy

02:29:29.005 --> 02:29:31.365
in full monochromatic glory

02:29:31.365 --> 02:29:35.258
all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub,

02:29:36.345 --> 02:29:37.488
but not today.

02:29:38.535 --> 02:29:41.868
No weird graphics, no puppet murder.

02:29:43.215 --> 02:29:44.548
No Sam Riegel.

02:29:47.972 --> 02:29:49.198
It's just me,

02:29:50.305 --> 02:29:52.868
here to say thank you.

02:29:54.385 --> 02:29:55.222
Love you all.

02:29:56.407 --> 02:29:57.324
Good night.

02:42:34.667 --> 02:42:37.785
(laughter)
MATT: And welcome back!

02:42:37.785 --> 02:42:41.222
Wow, you all, you all came in hot on that, all right!

02:42:41.222 --> 02:42:42.492
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

02:42:44.769 --> 02:42:46.087
MATT: You make one quiff.

02:42:46.087 --> 02:42:48.309
(laughter)
All right.

02:42:48.309 --> 02:42:50.549
TRAVIS: It's all over.
(laughter)

02:42:50.549 --> 02:42:51.725
MATT: So.
TRAVIS: (tiny fart noise)

02:42:51.725 --> 02:42:54.549
(giggling)

02:42:54.549 --> 02:42:55.679
SAM: Oh boy.

02:42:55.679 --> 02:42:58.519
MATT: Fjord suddenly slips-- no.
(laughter)

02:42:58.519 --> 02:43:00.059
TRAVIS: Yeah, 275.
MARISHA: Oh god.

02:43:00.059 --> 02:43:04.039
MATT: We come back within the frost and ice-coated chamber,

02:43:04.039 --> 02:43:08.569
where you saw Veth vanish down the extensive pit

02:43:08.569 --> 02:43:10.659
into darkness below.

02:43:10.659 --> 02:43:12.519
Seemingly survived because you heard her shout back

02:43:12.519 --> 02:43:15.709
up to confirm that she is indeed alive.

02:43:15.709 --> 02:43:18.589
But as you all now glance into this floorless room

02:43:18.589 --> 02:43:21.049
around the rubble, all you see now below you

02:43:21.049 --> 02:43:25.779
is the endless expanse of dark, dark pit below.

02:43:25.779 --> 02:43:29.329
TRAVIS: There are no sorts of stairs working its way

02:43:29.329 --> 02:43:32.119
around in this shaft of darkness?

02:43:32.119 --> 02:43:33.439
MATT: Not that you can see, no.

02:43:33.439 --> 02:43:35.389
TALIESIN: What's above?

02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:39.699
MATT: A very low ceiling of broken, fallen stone, ice,

02:43:39.699 --> 02:43:42.119
and looks like elements of broken pillar

02:43:42.119 --> 02:43:44.909
that have buckled and are being pushed against the wall.

02:43:44.909 --> 02:43:46.286
Most of this room collapsed.

02:43:46.286 --> 02:43:47.899
LAURA: Veth, are you okay?

02:43:47.899 --> 02:43:50.629
SAM: I'm fine. I'm going to look for a way out.

02:43:50.629 --> 02:43:53.829
I don't know if this is the way or what, but--

02:43:53.829 --> 02:43:56.039
TRAVIS: Are you-- are you alone down there?

02:43:56.039 --> 02:43:57.139
TALIESIN: There, there, there.

02:43:57.139 --> 02:43:58.259
SAM: I don't know!

02:43:58.259 --> 02:43:59.614
LIAM: So hard to understand.

02:43:59.614 --> 02:44:02.741
SAM: Am I-- am I alone?
LIAM: (high-pitched noise)

02:44:04.599 --> 02:44:06.662
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:44:06.662 --> 02:44:08.820
TRAVIS: (growling)
SAM: 20!

02:44:10.347 --> 02:44:13.039
MATT: So here at the base of this ragged cavity,

02:44:13.039 --> 02:44:18.039
you do find two frozen, extremely broken bodies.

02:44:18.569 --> 02:44:20.919
One appears to be human at first glance.

02:44:20.919 --> 02:44:23.549
One appears to be halfling at first glance,

02:44:23.549 --> 02:44:27.039
and they lie amongst the shattered shale

02:44:27.039 --> 02:44:28.882
and fallen litter and debris.

02:44:30.529 --> 02:44:34.229
It's about 20, 25 feet wide, and the chamber walls itself

02:44:34.229 --> 02:44:35.909
are a little oblong and strangely shaped

02:44:35.909 --> 02:44:39.302
from the naturally formed tunnel that you plummeted through.

02:44:40.259 --> 02:44:44.346
But, I mean, that's what you see at that glance around you.

02:44:46.409 --> 02:44:49.159
SAM: I will look over the bodies real quick,

02:44:49.159 --> 02:44:51.329
see if I recognize them or if they're fresh,

02:44:51.329 --> 02:44:53.329
or anything like that.

02:44:53.329 --> 02:44:55.997
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

02:44:57.114 --> 02:44:58.379
SAM: 23.

02:44:58.379 --> 02:45:02.172
MATT: Okay, their bodies have been picked over.

02:45:04.359 --> 02:45:06.029
They look like they've been frozen

02:45:06.029 --> 02:45:07.729
and broken here for a while.

02:45:09.799 --> 02:45:13.069
SAM: Okay, then I will set about making my way

02:45:13.069 --> 02:45:15.439
through the spikes and trying to find

02:45:15.439 --> 02:45:20.082
some sort of wall or exit.

02:45:21.279 --> 02:45:24.159
MATT: Okay, make another investigation check for me, please.

02:45:24.159 --> 02:45:25.479
SAM: Okay.

02:45:25.479 --> 02:45:27.249
I don't know why I rolled twice, but the one

02:45:27.249 --> 02:45:29.359
that I would count is a natural one,

02:45:29.359 --> 02:45:32.852
but with all sorts of things, it becomes 23.

02:45:33.729 --> 02:45:36.209
MATT: Right, okay.

02:45:36.209 --> 02:45:40.376
You glance around at the interior here, and it is--

02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:45.039
the pit is solid, but it is cluttered here, and

02:45:47.333 --> 02:45:50.879
you can't seem to find any give,

02:45:50.879 --> 02:45:52.809
any entrance, any weak way here.

02:45:52.809 --> 02:45:55.609
It's hard to get through because there is little light.

02:45:55.609 --> 02:45:57.759
It is very cluttered.

02:45:57.759 --> 02:45:59.969
You do pick up a weird acerbic smell

02:45:59.969 --> 02:46:01.619
in the air that wasn't there previously.

02:46:01.619 --> 02:46:04.129
SAM: Acerbic smell; from my--
LAURA: What is "acerbic"?

02:46:04.129 --> 02:46:08.189
SAM: -- my alchemical knowledge, do I pick up any--

02:46:08.189 --> 02:46:11.149
is it acidic or any, or, or--

02:46:11.149 --> 02:46:14.869
MATT: It feels acidic, but you
can't quite pinpoint specifically

02:46:14.869 --> 02:46:17.248
what the smell is.

02:46:17.248 --> 02:46:18.801
ASHLEY'S TABLET: -- scientists were able to--

02:46:18.801 --> 02:46:22.800
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Sorry!

02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:27.800
(laughter)

02:46:28.181 --> 02:46:30.059
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry.

02:46:30.059 --> 02:46:31.478
SAM: I don't think that you are.

02:46:31.478 --> 02:46:36.320
(laughter)
TRAVIS and SAM: (yell)

02:46:37.469 --> 02:46:39.283
SAM: We'll post that later on.

02:46:39.283 --> 02:46:42.429
(laughter)

02:46:42.429 --> 02:46:44.189
MATT: But you do, after a moment of searching,

02:46:44.189 --> 02:46:46.229
following the smell, find what you think

02:46:46.229 --> 02:46:47.862
is the source of that scent.

02:46:48.699 --> 02:46:49.882
SAM: Okay?
MATT: As you glance

02:46:49.882 --> 02:46:53.282
in this one section, and there is, like, an oily,

02:46:53.282 --> 02:46:56.259
tar-like substance that is between a couple

02:46:56.259 --> 02:46:57.889
of these broken slab elements.

02:46:57.889 --> 02:47:01.227
SAM: A tar-like substance.
MATT: It looks like, a slick oil tar.

02:47:01.227 --> 02:47:02.752
LAURA: And it's not frozen?

02:47:02.752 --> 02:47:03.729
MATT: It's not frozen.
LAURA: I'm not there.

02:47:03.729 --> 02:47:04.562
MATT: You're not there.

02:47:04.562 --> 02:47:06.939
SAM: I will touch it.

02:47:06.939 --> 02:47:10.279
MATT: Okay, you touch it, and

02:47:11.579 --> 02:47:13.679
it tingles the end of the fingers.

02:47:17.177 --> 02:47:19.418
(slurping) It shoots out and begins to wrap around you.

02:47:19.418 --> 02:47:20.911
LIAM: Damn it, it's an ooze!

02:47:21.944 --> 02:47:23.090
MATT: I'm going to go get the other battlefield map.

02:47:23.090 --> 02:47:24.578
(groaning)
TRAVIS: Oh no,

02:47:24.578 --> 02:47:26.114
you're fucking by yourself!

02:47:26.114 --> 02:47:28.722
LIAM: He's with a black pudding or something, oh!

02:47:28.722 --> 02:47:30.613
MARISHA: No, it's the black-- oh no!

02:47:30.613 --> 02:47:32.779
That's not good.
SAM: I thought it was, like, a goo!

02:47:32.779 --> 02:47:34.870
LAURA: You survived a fall, and you--

02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:38.001
SAM: What do I got-- I'm trying to find a way out!

02:47:38.001 --> 02:47:39.249
TRAVIS: Oh no!
ASHLEY: Oh, that's so cool!

02:47:39.249 --> 02:47:40.579
LAURA: In such a teeny, tiny

02:47:40.579 --> 02:47:42.629
little room all alone, Veth.
TALIESIN: Oh no!

02:47:42.629 --> 02:47:44.379
TRAVIS: We didn't even short rest or nothing.

02:47:44.379 --> 02:47:46.419
LAURA: Can we-- did we hear her scream?

02:47:46.419 --> 02:47:49.369
MATT: You do. You hear the scream. (laughs)

02:47:49.369 --> 02:47:52.202
LAURA: Oh no!
MATT: You don't know what it means, but.

02:47:54.109 --> 02:47:56.832
First, we shall see,

02:47:57.919 --> 02:48:01.965
as it does get an ambush round on you.

02:48:03.020 --> 02:48:04.557
LAURA: (frustrated raspberry)

02:48:04.557 --> 02:48:07.724
LIAM: We got all these people up here. Shit.

02:48:11.095 --> 02:48:13.735
MARISHA: 275 feet down?
MATT: That is 17 to hit.

02:48:13.735 --> 02:48:15.629
MARISHA: That's far.
SAM: Misses.

02:48:15.629 --> 02:48:16.709
MATT: It misses.

02:48:16.709 --> 02:48:19.749
You (whooshing) pull back as these weird tendrils

02:48:19.749 --> 02:48:23.049
of black shoot out towards you and then withdraw,

02:48:23.049 --> 02:48:26.358
and with that, you watch as this black

02:48:26.358 --> 02:48:30.229
mass of thick, slimy, oily tar

02:48:30.229 --> 02:48:33.979
begins to slowly emerge from the cracks below.

02:48:35.409 --> 02:48:36.719
Roll initiative for me, please.

02:48:36.719 --> 02:48:38.499
SAM: Okay.

02:48:38.499 --> 02:48:42.097
Natural one!
MARISHA: Oh no!

02:48:42.097 --> 02:48:44.384
MATT: It's still an ability check, so.

02:48:44.384 --> 02:48:46.409
SAM: Ability check?
TRAVIS: What's your dex mod?

02:48:46.409 --> 02:48:49.179
SAM: I mean, it's six total.
MATT: Well, with your dex mod,

02:48:49.179 --> 02:48:50.869
and it's your Reliable Talent.

02:48:50.869 --> 02:48:53.709
I believe it does work for that, right?

02:48:53.709 --> 02:48:55.579
SAM: I don't think so. Wait, what?

02:48:55.579 --> 02:48:57.729
My initiative just says plus five.

02:48:57.729 --> 02:49:01.199
MATT: Initiative is an ability check.

02:49:01.199 --> 02:49:03.366
LAURA: Is it?
MATT: I'm pretty sure.

02:49:04.261 --> 02:49:06.135
LAURA: I never knew!

02:49:06.135 --> 02:49:09.735
TRAVIS: ♪ I never knew, I never ♪

02:49:09.735 --> 02:49:11.199
TALIESIN: That changes many things,
TRAVIS: ♪ I never knew ♪

02:49:11.199 --> 02:49:12.559
TALIESIN: I would say.
LAURA: ♪ Never knew ♪

02:49:12.559 --> 02:49:14.170
MATT: Doesn't change too much--
TRAVIS: ♪ I never knew ♪

02:49:14.170 --> 02:49:15.674
SAM: ♪ Knew, knew ♪
MATT: Because--

02:49:15.674 --> 02:49:17.449
SAM: ♪ I never knew ♪
TALIESIN: It changes the very concept

02:49:17.449 --> 02:49:19.719
of the universe right there.
(laughter)

02:49:19.719 --> 02:49:23.097
Everything I thought I believed. All bets are off now.

02:49:23.097 --> 02:49:24.931
LIAM: What the fuck is wrong with us?

02:49:24.931 --> 02:49:26.336
(laughter)

02:49:26.336 --> 02:49:29.269
TALIESIN: Look, it's coming out of my mouth.

02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:31.714
That video ruined me. (laughs)
MATT: I know.

02:49:31.714 --> 02:49:32.971
TRAVIS: (shrieking)

02:49:32.971 --> 02:49:35.128
MATT: It's a dexterity check. It is an ability check.

02:49:35.128 --> 02:49:37.182
LAURA and TALIESIN: Wow.

02:49:37.182 --> 02:49:41.019
SAM: But a dexterity check, I don't get Reliable Talent

02:49:41.019 --> 02:49:43.424
on dexterity checks.

02:49:43.424 --> 02:49:45.984
MATT: What does your Reliable Talent affect?

02:49:45.984 --> 02:49:47.381
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh no.

02:49:47.381 --> 02:49:50.819
Have you not been doing this?
SAM: What?

02:49:50.819 --> 02:49:52.113
MARISHA: What's a rogue?

02:49:52.113 --> 02:49:54.819
(laughter)
What?

02:49:54.819 --> 02:49:55.969
MATT: Whenever you make an ability check,

02:49:55.969 --> 02:49:57.504
oh, that lets you add your proficiency bonus,

02:49:57.504 --> 02:49:58.337
so no, you're right.

02:49:58.337 --> 02:49:59.749
SAM: Ah!
MATT: You are correct.

02:49:59.749 --> 02:50:03.199
SAM: I am the best at D&amp;D.
MATT: I just wanted to double check.

02:50:03.199 --> 02:50:05.694
So, so six, okay.
SAM: So six.

02:50:08.449 --> 02:50:09.739
MATT: Weirdly, you're going first.

02:50:09.739 --> 02:50:11.629
SAM: Hey!
(laughter)

02:50:11.629 --> 02:50:15.072
MATT: It rolled higher, but it's pretty--

02:50:16.537 --> 02:50:17.969
it has a really high negative.

02:50:17.969 --> 02:50:21.636
SAM: Okay, okay, I will...

02:50:24.599 --> 02:50:27.069
I will bonus action Disengage.

02:50:27.069 --> 02:50:29.835
MATT: Okay.
SAM: And then...

02:50:29.835 --> 02:50:33.309
back flip, back flip, back flip away from it.

02:50:33.309 --> 02:50:34.939
Or, you know, run.

02:50:34.939 --> 02:50:35.772
MATT: How far?

02:50:35.772 --> 02:50:38.069
SAM: As far as I can get.

02:50:38.069 --> 02:50:41.569
LIAM: That's so cool.
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20.

02:50:41.569 --> 02:50:43.118
LIAM: God, it's like something out of The Hobbit.

02:50:43.118 --> 02:50:46.097
MATT: 25 is about, that's about as
far as you can get right there.

02:50:46.097 --> 02:50:48.519
You're just in the bottom of this area, like, "Fuck, fuck!"

02:50:48.519 --> 02:50:53.519
SAM: Uh-huh, and I will-- I will shoot-- let's see here.

02:50:53.539 --> 02:50:56.616
Do I have spells that I could use on this thing?

02:50:56.616 --> 02:50:59.772
Not really, unless it doesn't like gusts of wind.

02:51:01.299 --> 02:51:02.747
Ooh, maybe this?

02:51:02.747 --> 02:51:05.259
Well, I don't know if it has wisdom.

02:51:05.259 --> 02:51:06.549
Let's see here.

02:51:06.549 --> 02:51:08.709
(reading and muttering) Has to make a wisdom saving throw

02:51:08.709 --> 02:51:11.199
on a failed save-- failed save. (mutters)

02:51:11.199 --> 02:51:12.529
Sure, I'll try this.

02:51:12.529 --> 02:51:15.549
I don't know what it is. Can it see?

02:51:15.549 --> 02:51:17.139
Does it need to see? I don't know, who knows!

02:51:17.139 --> 02:51:19.019
I take out a pocket full of buttons,

02:51:19.019 --> 02:51:22.449
and I throw them and cast Hypnotic Pattern.

02:51:22.449 --> 02:51:24.239
MATT: Hypnotic Pattern, okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

02:51:24.239 --> 02:51:26.899
SAM: Does it need to see? Does
it need to have intelligence?

02:51:26.899 --> 02:51:29.059
I don't know. We'll find out!

02:51:29.059 --> 02:51:30.709
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's pretty fair

02:51:30.709 --> 02:51:33.528
in the moment.
MATT: Wisdom saving throw.

02:51:33.528 --> 02:51:35.619
MARISHA: I like the idea of a
pocketful of buttons. That's cool.

02:51:35.619 --> 02:51:37.731
MATT: 13.
SAM: 16.

02:51:37.731 --> 02:51:41.017
MATT: You got it. So it is currently
charmed and incapacitated.

02:51:41.017 --> 02:51:43.475
ASHLEY: (to "Pocketful of Sunshine")

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:48.127
MATT: (laughing) Oh my god!

02:51:48.127 --> 02:51:50.143
TRAVIS: It's coming apart at the seams.
MATT: We are--

02:51:50.143 --> 02:51:52.526
TRAVIS: This is re-entry.
MATT: Yeah, oh yeah.

02:51:52.526 --> 02:51:53.939
TRAVIS: One of the heat shields cracked.

02:51:53.939 --> 02:51:56.249
MATT: We are a mentally broken crew tonight.

02:51:56.249 --> 02:51:57.830
ASHLEY: Well, when you're not around people
and then you get around people--

02:51:57.830 --> 02:51:59.742
TRAVIS: (falsetto) ♪ Oh, I got a pocketful of buttons ♪

02:51:59.742 --> 02:52:02.009
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

02:52:02.009 --> 02:52:04.442
So you watch as it begins to emerge. (squelches)

02:52:04.442 --> 02:52:06.309
You finish, you throw the buttons, and the buttons

02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:08.119
(whooshing) flash in the air above it

02:52:08.119 --> 02:52:11.644
in a multicolor spray as it reacts--

02:52:13.394 --> 02:52:15.119
(gurgles)

02:52:15.119 --> 02:52:16.441
It just holds its position there.

02:52:16.441 --> 02:52:17.549
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

02:52:17.549 --> 02:52:20.615
SAM: Okay, okay, I will call up:

02:52:20.615 --> 02:52:22.198
Um, guys!

02:52:23.226 --> 02:52:24.592
(screams)

02:52:24.592 --> 02:52:29.459
I'm being attacked by a black ooze of some sort!

02:52:29.459 --> 02:52:32.459
(yells) Maybe-- should I just come up,

02:52:32.459 --> 02:52:34.125
or are you coming down?

02:52:35.249 --> 02:52:37.109
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, you should come up.

02:52:37.109 --> 02:52:39.369
SAM: But what if this is the way out?

02:52:39.369 --> 02:52:41.659
ASHLEY: Can you look for any--?

02:52:41.659 --> 02:52:43.749
SAM: I've got 55 seconds.

02:52:43.749 --> 02:52:45.269
MATT: That's your turn.
SAM: 54 seconds.

02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:47.349
MATT: All right, that's all we got.
It's now the black ooze's turn.

02:52:47.349 --> 02:52:49.373
SAM: Okay.
MATT: It's incapacitated.

02:52:49.373 --> 02:52:50.298
Its friend, however--

02:52:50.298 --> 02:52:51.563
ALL: (gasps) No!

02:52:51.563 --> 02:52:53.345
MARISHA: Oh no, you got to get out of there!

02:52:53.345 --> 02:52:54.178
You got to get out!

02:52:54.178 --> 02:52:56.994
MATT: Emerges. (squelching)
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:52:56.994 --> 02:52:59.809
LIAM: "Go home and get your shine box."

02:52:59.809 --> 02:53:02.096
MATT: And 15, 20, it does

02:53:02.096 --> 02:53:05.180
manage to just get in range towards you.
SAM: Oh no!

02:53:05.180 --> 02:53:06.149
LAURA: Okay, wait. I have an idea.

02:53:06.149 --> 02:53:08.969
MATT: It's going to go ahead and-- its pseudopod (whooshes)

02:53:08.969 --> 02:53:11.535
strikes out towards you for...

02:53:11.535 --> 02:53:13.106
a 19 to hit.

02:53:13.106 --> 02:53:14.399
SAM: Hits!
MATT: All righty.

02:53:15.419 --> 02:53:16.485
You take...

02:53:17.344 --> 02:53:19.027
three points of bludgeoning damage.

02:53:19.027 --> 02:53:20.099
SAM: Well, I mean.

02:53:20.099 --> 02:53:21.242
MATT: Plus...

02:53:22.409 --> 02:53:24.492
TALIESIN: It's the plus that gets you.

02:53:26.649 --> 02:53:28.559
MATT: 16 points of acid damage.

02:53:28.559 --> 02:53:29.992
SAM: Ooh!
MARISHA: It's true, yeah. Yeah.

02:53:29.992 --> 02:53:31.175
TALIESIN: It's the plus that gets you.

02:53:31.175 --> 02:53:33.259
SAM: I can Uncanny Dodge that, I guess.

02:53:33.259 --> 02:53:36.119
MATT: You can, yeah, so you take eight points.

02:53:36.119 --> 02:53:37.899
SAM: Okay, plus the three.

02:53:37.899 --> 02:53:39.719
MATT: Is your armor magical?

02:53:40.578 --> 02:53:42.679
LIAM: Uh-oh.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:53:42.679 --> 02:53:44.909
SAM: It is.
MATT: It is.

02:53:44.909 --> 02:53:47.619
SAM: In that it can change its appearance--

02:53:47.619 --> 02:53:48.889
MATT: Correct, but it is magical armor.

02:53:48.889 --> 02:53:50.577
SAM: It is a magical armor.

02:53:50.577 --> 02:53:53.656
MATT: It resists the acidic effects of its pseudopod

02:53:53.656 --> 02:53:56.856
and does not diminish, so.
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:53:57.759 --> 02:53:59.749
So the 16 points are negated or no?

02:53:59.749 --> 02:54:02.027
MATT: No, no, you still take the damage, but the armor

02:54:02.027 --> 02:54:04.474
is not melted away.

02:54:04.474 --> 02:54:06.019
(groaning)

02:54:06.019 --> 02:54:08.058
MARISHA: Fuck, get out!

02:54:08.058 --> 02:54:09.139
SAM: Yeah!
MARISHA: Get out!

02:54:09.139 --> 02:54:11.539
SAM: You think?
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:54:11.539 --> 02:54:14.122
MATT: So that ends its turn.
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

02:54:15.219 --> 02:54:16.769
MATT: Go ahead and make a concentration check for me.

02:54:16.769 --> 02:54:18.949
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
LIAM: Shit.

02:54:18.949 --> 02:54:20.979
SAM: Pretty good, 17 plus something.

02:54:20.979 --> 02:54:23.070
MATT: Okay, you maintain concentration on your pattern.

02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:26.949
SAM: Okay, okay.
MATT: So now, you all heard what Veth said.

02:54:26.949 --> 02:54:28.378
What are you doing?

02:54:28.378 --> 02:54:30.729
LAURA: I'm going to Dimension Door.

02:54:30.729 --> 02:54:32.129
MATT: Okay.

02:54:32.129 --> 02:54:35.209
You cannot see the distance.

02:54:35.209 --> 02:54:37.760
You have to go-- is it somewhere you can--

02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:39.619
SAM: You can pick a direction.
MATT: You can just choose.

02:54:39.619 --> 02:54:41.069
That's true, you can just pick a direction.

02:54:41.069 --> 02:54:42.420
SAM: But you also have to pick a distance.

02:54:42.420 --> 02:54:45.399
So you would have to guess how far down it is.

02:54:45.399 --> 02:54:46.399
LAURA: Fuck.

02:54:46.399 --> 02:54:48.057
MATT: You could throw a torch down there. (laughs)

02:54:48.057 --> 02:54:50.209
That's a way to do it. Somebody else could.

02:54:50.209 --> 02:54:53.049
LAURA: Somebody else, so I can
Dimension Door down really fast?

02:54:53.049 --> 02:54:57.819
TALIESIN: Well, we'd have to wait
for the torch to land, but no.

02:54:57.819 --> 02:55:00.564
LAURA: Do we have a torch?
SAM: (laughs)

02:55:00.564 --> 02:55:02.299
I've got all the torches!
LAURA: We can see--

02:55:02.299 --> 02:55:05.471
we can see-- Caleb has lights down in the tunnel, right?

02:55:05.471 --> 02:55:07.789
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, he put down his globules, right?

02:55:07.789 --> 02:55:09.319
LIAM: Yeah, I sent them down already,

02:55:09.319 --> 02:55:11.489
so they-- they're some distance in.

02:55:11.489 --> 02:55:12.839
MATT: What's the range on that spell?

02:55:12.839 --> 02:55:14.992
LIAM: Oh, it's like, it's over 100 feet.

02:55:16.367 --> 02:55:18.349
TALIESIN: It wouldn't have made it all the way down, then.

02:55:19.857 --> 02:55:21.425
LIAM: 120 feet.

02:55:21.425 --> 02:55:23.927
MATT: So it can get less than halfway down.

02:55:25.438 --> 02:55:27.807
SAM: ♪ (vocalizes background music) ♪
LAURA: You can say--

02:55:29.489 --> 02:55:31.469
TRAVIS: You don't want us to engage? You're okay?

02:55:31.469 --> 02:55:33.602
MARISHA: Yeah, do you want us to jump in the hole?

02:55:34.789 --> 02:55:36.609
TRAVIS: Nott, do you need help? (laughs)

02:55:36.609 --> 02:55:38.419
SAM: No, I'm fine!
MARISHA: Okay.

02:55:40.179 --> 02:55:41.369
MATT: Okay.

02:55:41.369 --> 02:55:43.419
MARISHA: Get out of the hole.
SAM: Yeah.

02:55:43.419 --> 02:55:44.949
MATT: So, you guys are all staying up there?

02:55:44.949 --> 02:55:46.774
LAURA: She just said not to come down!
MARISHA: I guess so!

02:55:46.774 --> 02:55:49.376
MATT: Okay, all right, so y'all hold and wait.

02:55:49.376 --> 02:55:51.242
Top of the round. Veth, you're up.

02:55:51.242 --> 02:55:52.922
SAM: Bonus action: Disengage.

02:55:53.861 --> 02:55:56.469
(snaps fingers) Cast Spider Climb and start running up.

02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:57.302
ASHLEY: What if there's--

02:55:57.302 --> 02:55:59.048
LIAM: I'm going to pull up the Driftglobe and light it up

02:55:59.048 --> 02:56:00.209
in that moment of panic.
MATT: Okay.

02:56:00.209 --> 02:56:01.949
So you bonus action disengage.

02:56:01.949 --> 02:56:04.309
You cast Spider Climb, which means the charm goes away.

02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:05.788
MARISHA: What's the Driftglobe?

02:56:05.788 --> 02:56:07.169
Does it have a further range?
LIAM: Daylight.

02:56:07.169 --> 02:56:09.739
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: What if these things can go up the wall?

02:56:09.739 --> 02:56:10.572
LAURA: Well.
SAM: They probably can.

02:56:10.572 --> 02:56:13.239
MATT: All right, so you can now Spider Climb.

02:56:13.239 --> 02:56:17.399
That puts you at your full movement at 35 feet.

02:56:17.399 --> 02:56:18.699
SAM: Uh-huh, I think.
MATT: All right, so you are

02:56:18.699 --> 02:56:21.516
35 feet up the side here.

02:56:22.449 --> 02:56:23.439
Okay.
SAM: I hope they can't

02:56:23.439 --> 02:56:25.177
move faster.
MATT: That finishes your turn.

02:56:25.177 --> 02:56:26.969
SAM: Oh no, they probably can!

02:56:26.969 --> 02:56:29.086
MATT: Okay.

02:56:29.086 --> 02:56:32.860
And beginning of their turn. (slurping)

02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:36.665
(yelling)

02:56:36.665 --> 02:56:39.203
MARISHA: No way!
MATT: Moves 40 feet up the wall.

02:56:39.203 --> 02:56:41.528
SAM: 40 feet?!
MARISHA: No!

02:56:42.555 --> 02:56:45.046
MATT: And wraps around you with itself--

02:56:45.046 --> 02:56:46.279
(mini clatters) -- as you fall and die.

02:56:46.279 --> 02:56:48.739
TALIESIN: It doesn't even take its
action to get 40 feet up the wall?

02:56:48.739 --> 02:56:49.709
MATT: Yes.
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:56:49.709 --> 02:56:52.029
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

02:56:52.029 --> 02:56:54.379
we should help now.
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20.

02:56:54.379 --> 02:56:58.688
SAM: (yells) Remember when I said I was fine?

02:56:59.919 --> 02:57:02.572
MATT: So now, as you're going up the wall, you look behind,

02:57:02.572 --> 02:57:05.147
and one just slithers up the side of the wall

02:57:05.147 --> 02:57:06.788
and wraps around you.

02:57:06.788 --> 02:57:09.589
It's not holding you, but it's now filling the space

02:57:09.589 --> 02:57:10.569
around you.
MARISHA: You need to get down?

02:57:10.569 --> 02:57:13.519
MATT: The other one is now trying to
climb up after you as well.

02:57:13.519 --> 02:57:14.979
All right, so who's doing what?

02:57:14.979 --> 02:57:17.119
LAURA: I'm going to grab Beau.
MARISHA: Okay?

02:57:17.119 --> 02:57:19.219
LAURA: And I'm going to Dimension Door us

02:57:19.219 --> 02:57:21.372
down as much as I can see because he cast Daylight.

02:57:21.372 --> 02:57:23.651
MARISHA: Do you need a light to
get down there before we do this?

02:57:23.651 --> 02:57:24.867
LAURA: He cast Daylight.

02:57:24.867 --> 02:57:27.399
LIAM: But it's not everywhere. It's 60 feet.

02:57:27.399 --> 02:57:30.457
I shove the Driftglobe into Fjord's hand

02:57:30.457 --> 02:57:32.113
and turn into a giant eagle,

02:57:32.113 --> 02:57:36.059
(whooshes) and I grab Caduceus and Fjord

02:57:36.059 --> 02:57:38.557
and start flying down the passage.

02:57:38.557 --> 02:57:39.534
TRAVIS: You just want to stay up here?

02:57:39.534 --> 02:57:40.879
TALIESIN: I'm 26 hit points.

02:57:40.879 --> 02:57:42.682
TRAVIS: Yeah, just leave him up.

02:57:42.682 --> 02:57:44.179
LIAM: All right, all right.
TALIESIN: Nope, nope, nope, nope.

02:57:44.179 --> 02:57:46.799
LIAM: All right, I grab Yasha by the neck, yep, and Fjord.

02:57:46.799 --> 02:57:49.749
SAM: You know what, I'll be fine. It's okay, guys.
MATT: I think my giant eagle mini is at the old table.

02:57:49.749 --> 02:57:52.449
MARISHA: I will, right before Jester grabs me,

02:57:52.449 --> 02:57:54.629
I'm going to take out a celebone,

02:57:54.629 --> 02:57:55.843
and I'm going to crack it,

02:57:55.843 --> 02:57:57.643
and I'm going to throw the celebone down there

02:57:57.643 --> 02:57:59.209
at the end so that she can see

02:57:59.209 --> 02:58:00.589
as we go down.
LAURA: So it's a rave party.

02:58:00.589 --> 02:58:01.564
MARISHA: It's a rave.
MATT: You got it.

02:58:01.564 --> 02:58:03.335
MARISHA: It's a rave torch at the bottom.

02:58:03.335 --> 02:58:07.639
MATT: Okay, okay, it will fall, and by the end of the round,

02:58:07.639 --> 02:58:08.869
the full distance to go there.

02:58:08.869 --> 02:58:09.922
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Shit.

02:58:10.830 --> 02:58:11.663
MARISHA: It's your choice.
LIAM: But you're holding

02:58:11.663 --> 02:58:13.849
a cantaloupe that's glowing Daylight

02:58:13.849 --> 02:58:15.819
60 feet in every direction, in your hand.

02:58:15.819 --> 02:58:16.739
MATT: All right, so--

02:58:16.739 --> 02:58:21.259
LAURA: I'm going to just--
I'm going to bamf us 250 feet down.

02:58:21.259 --> 02:58:23.949
I don't know how much farther it is after that.

02:58:23.949 --> 02:58:24.929
MARISHA: Do it.

02:58:24.929 --> 02:58:25.856
MATT: You're just choosing 250?

02:58:25.856 --> 02:58:27.379
LAURA: I'm just choosing 250.

02:58:27.379 --> 02:58:31.599
MATT: Okay, both of you (whooshes) reappear

02:58:32.765 --> 02:58:35.096
(whooshes) and fall an additional 20 feet.

02:58:35.096 --> 02:58:37.339
MARISHA: Can I do like what I've done before

02:58:37.339 --> 02:58:40.969
and, like, brace Jester

02:58:40.969 --> 02:58:42.802
on top of me and take the blow?

02:58:42.802 --> 02:58:43.919
LAURA: No!

02:58:43.919 --> 02:58:45.819
MARISHA: I've got Slow Fall.
LAURA: Okay.

02:58:45.819 --> 02:58:49.539
MATT: Okay, so you manage to fall, you manage to kick

02:58:49.539 --> 02:58:52.889
off the wall, and what it does is instead,

02:58:52.889 --> 02:58:55.759
Slow Fall reduces the damage to you to little,

02:58:55.759 --> 02:58:57.549
but you don't take all of her damage away.

02:58:57.549 --> 02:58:58.629
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: So you just reduce

02:58:58.629 --> 02:58:59.462
her damage.
MARISHA: But I pad her a little bit?

02:58:59.462 --> 02:59:01.847
MATT: You do, so you take five points of bludgeoning damage

02:59:01.847 --> 02:59:02.680
from the impact.
LAURA: Okay.

02:59:02.680 --> 02:59:05.289
TRAVIS: Still falling 20 feet onto Beau.

02:59:05.289 --> 02:59:06.774
MATT: And both of you.

02:59:06.774 --> 02:59:07.989
MARISHA: (groans)

02:59:07.989 --> 02:59:09.069
LAURA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

02:59:09.069 --> 02:59:12.939
MARISHA: I'm good. I got this.
MATT: Right there in that space.

02:59:12.939 --> 02:59:14.809
LAURA: Okay, now you can do something!

02:59:14.809 --> 02:59:16.289
SAM: Well...

02:59:16.289 --> 02:59:18.249
MARISHA: Oh, am I there? Can I go, am I there?

02:59:18.249 --> 02:59:20.329
SAM: Hate to be a rules lawyer,

02:59:20.329 --> 02:59:22.079
but she doesn't have her goggles,

02:59:22.079 --> 02:59:22.969
and there's no light down there.

02:59:22.969 --> 02:59:23.802
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Well, I threw

02:59:23.802 --> 02:59:25.043
down the celebone.
MATT: Well, no,

02:59:25.043 --> 02:59:25.876
she threw the celebone down.

02:59:25.876 --> 02:59:27.819
SAM: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
MARISHA: So it's a rave

02:59:27.819 --> 02:59:28.698
down there right now.
MATT: Well, actually,

02:59:28.698 --> 02:59:30.069
well, it would've been your action to crack it

02:59:30.069 --> 02:59:32.199
and throw it down before you went, so that's your turn.

02:59:32.199 --> 02:59:35.919
MARISHA: I just look up,
and I wait for the LED stick to fall.

02:59:35.919 --> 02:59:38.439
MATT: Correct, and you watch as it, boom,

02:59:38.439 --> 02:59:40.299
and as soon as that happens, you look over,

02:59:40.299 --> 02:59:42.323
and you see these two giant black masses,

02:59:42.323 --> 02:59:44.109
(slurping) up the wall,

02:59:44.109 --> 02:59:46.078
and one of them turns around and goes, like,

02:59:46.078 --> 02:59:47.958
and begins to move back in your direction.

02:59:47.958 --> 02:59:49.679
SAM: (yelling)
MATT: (slurping)

02:59:49.679 --> 02:59:51.429
LAURA: Oh god, that would be so creepy!
MARISHA: It flashes

02:59:51.429 --> 02:59:53.706
in different colors every time it goes.

02:59:53.706 --> 02:59:54.839
LAURA: This reminds me of that

02:59:54.839 --> 02:59:57.164
Danny Elfman video that you sent.

02:59:57.164 --> 02:59:59.381
(laughter)

02:59:59.381 --> 03:00:00.747
MATT: Hell yeah.

03:00:00.747 --> 03:00:02.468
All righty, I need you both to roll initiative.

03:00:02.468 --> 03:00:05.249
LAURA: Okay.

03:00:05.249 --> 03:00:06.829
LIAM: Oh, you two.

03:00:06.829 --> 03:00:08.269
LAURA: 15.
MARISHA: Oh, roll for initiative?

03:00:08.269 --> 03:00:09.426
MATT: Yes.

03:00:11.192 --> 03:00:15.396
MARISHA: I'm going to roll with my boots with this one.

03:00:15.396 --> 03:00:18.809
Seven, eight, nine, 14 total.

03:00:18.809 --> 03:00:19.679
MATT: And you got, what was it?

03:00:19.679 --> 03:00:21.429
LAURA: 15.
MATT: All right, so.

03:00:23.849 --> 03:00:28.409
You got it, okay.
So now, Veth, your turn.

03:00:28.409 --> 03:00:30.879
You have Spider Walk on, you're on the side of the wall.

03:00:30.879 --> 03:00:33.429
The creature is starting to swirl around you.

03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:34.999
What are you going to do?

03:00:34.999 --> 03:00:37.922
SAM: I'm aware that it's faster than me.

03:00:39.759 --> 03:00:41.919
LAURA: How are they faster than you? (laughs)

03:00:41.919 --> 03:00:44.479
SAM: So I'm not going to disengage.

03:00:44.479 --> 03:00:46.692
I'm just going to run up the wall.

03:00:47.649 --> 03:00:50.329
MATT: Okay, so you're going to run up 35 feet?

03:00:50.329 --> 03:00:51.907
SAM: Yes.
MATT: You got it.

03:00:51.907 --> 03:00:53.407
Let's do this one.

03:00:54.808 --> 03:00:55.658
LIAM: Man, oh man.

03:00:57.169 --> 03:00:59.079
MATT: As you dart past, it's going to go ahead and swing out

03:00:59.079 --> 03:01:03.179
with its pseudopod. (whooshes)

03:01:03.179 --> 03:01:04.399
That is a 23 to hit.

03:01:04.399 --> 03:01:05.359
SAM: Well, it hits.

03:01:05.359 --> 03:01:07.109
MATT: All right, you take

03:01:08.089 --> 03:01:09.759
five points of bludgeoning damage.

03:01:09.759 --> 03:01:12.509
SAM: Yes?
MATT: And

03:01:17.369 --> 03:01:19.579
22 points of acid damage.

03:01:19.579 --> 03:01:22.299
SAM: I guess I'll Uncanny Dodge that.

03:01:22.299 --> 03:01:25.779
MATT: Okay, so 22, that's 27, so that's 13 points

03:01:25.779 --> 03:01:27.559
of damage to you total.

03:01:27.559 --> 03:01:30.025
Go ahead and make another concentration check.

03:01:31.519 --> 03:01:33.949
SAM: Not good, seven plus something.

03:01:33.949 --> 03:01:35.823
MATT: Your feet (releasing).

03:01:35.823 --> 03:01:38.115
SAM: Wait, oh, concentration on Spider Climb?

03:01:38.115 --> 03:01:40.289
MATT: Yes.
SAM: That's a concentration spell?

03:01:40.289 --> 03:01:41.769
MATT: Is it? Double check.

03:01:41.769 --> 03:01:43.839
SAM: Totally is.
MATT: Yeah.

03:01:43.839 --> 03:01:45.489
That's what I thought.
SAM: Oh!

03:01:45.489 --> 03:01:48.457
MATT: You suddenly, your feet (whooshes, gasps).

03:01:48.457 --> 03:01:50.586
TRAVIS: Oh no, oh no!
MATT: And you just plummet.

03:01:50.586 --> 03:01:52.249
SAM: Oh, jeez.

03:01:52.249 --> 03:01:53.399
MATT: Now, the good news is you didn't

03:01:53.399 --> 03:01:55.289
get your whole 35 feet up before it hit you.

03:01:55.289 --> 03:01:58.249
It hit you as you left.
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

03:01:58.249 --> 03:02:00.601
MATT: So you do fall 30 feet,

03:02:01.609 --> 03:02:03.866
right into the other slime, sploosh!

03:02:03.866 --> 03:02:05.896
(laughter)

03:02:05.896 --> 03:02:08.149
TALIESIN: I feel like that would
negate some fall damage there.

03:02:08.149 --> 03:02:09.549
MARISHA: Yeah, it's got to, right?

03:02:09.549 --> 03:02:11.709
He just collapses?
MATT: Ooze doesn't

03:02:11.709 --> 03:02:13.380
take fall damage.

03:02:13.380 --> 03:02:14.389
It's an ooze.
TRAVIS: It's not a big air cushion

03:02:14.389 --> 03:02:15.321
like for stunt guys?
TALIESIN: No, I mean, like--

03:02:15.321 --> 03:02:16.629
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:02:16.629 --> 03:02:20.579
MATT: It does cushion your blow, so you only take

03:02:20.579 --> 03:02:23.269
six points of bludgeoning damage from the fall.

03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:26.669
However, I will say because you are impacting full-body

03:02:26.669 --> 03:02:29.549
into an acidic entity--
MARISHA: It shivers a little.

03:02:29.549 --> 03:02:32.049
MATT: -- you will take--
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

03:02:32.049 --> 03:02:33.959
MARISHA: (giggling)

03:02:33.959 --> 03:02:35.340
MATT: -- 12 points of acid damage.

03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:37.349
SAM: Damn!

03:02:37.349 --> 03:02:40.459
MATT: And you are prone inside this creature.

03:02:40.459 --> 03:02:42.869
It's now (squelching) around you,

03:02:42.869 --> 03:02:44.249
starting to block your vision.
TALIESIN: This is so bad.

03:02:44.249 --> 03:02:46.753
SAM: Wow, how did I get here?

03:02:46.753 --> 03:02:48.729
(laughter)

03:02:48.729 --> 03:02:51.029
This is not going well.
LIAM: Rapidly makes an air cavity

03:02:51.029 --> 03:02:53.740
that immediately poofs it out?

03:02:53.740 --> 03:02:55.979
(whooshing)
MATT: (laughs) Yep!

03:02:55.979 --> 03:02:59.329
So it's now--
TRAVIS: (fart found)

03:02:59.329 --> 03:03:00.162
MATT: -- these creatures' turn.

03:03:00.162 --> 03:03:02.262
This one is going--

03:03:02.262 --> 03:03:04.241
MARISHA: (laughing) He's shoving Play-Doh back

03:03:04.241 --> 03:03:05.918
into the tube.
MATT: -- down here.

03:03:05.918 --> 03:03:08.009
It can't take an action because it used its action

03:03:08.009 --> 03:03:10.809
to get down there, but it's right next to you, Jester.

03:03:10.809 --> 03:03:12.549
The other one is going to strike you.

03:03:12.549 --> 03:03:14.392
Because you are prone, it has advantage

03:03:14.392 --> 03:03:16.650
in the attack roll.
SAM: Sure, sure.

03:03:16.650 --> 03:03:18.589
LIAM: No!

03:03:18.589 --> 03:03:20.859
MATT: All right, that is going to be a 23 to hit.

03:03:20.859 --> 03:03:22.249
SAM: Uh-huh, hits.

03:03:22.249 --> 03:03:25.507
MATT: You take six points of bludgeoning damage.

03:03:27.206 --> 03:03:28.039
And...

03:03:30.169 --> 03:03:31.557
18 points of acid damage.

03:03:31.557 --> 03:03:33.729
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:03:33.729 --> 03:03:36.994
MATT: Now, if you are prone-- let me double check.

03:03:36.994 --> 03:03:40.056
TALIESIN: Oh no.
ASHLEY: Whoa, whoa, where we at?

03:03:40.056 --> 03:03:42.549
SAM: I'm alive.
LIAM: Still a solid,

03:03:42.549 --> 03:03:43.439
not a liquid?
MATT: Yeah, you can still

03:03:43.439 --> 03:03:46.789
take your reaction, technically, so.

03:03:46.789 --> 03:03:48.609
SAM: I mean, I already took a reaction.

03:03:48.609 --> 03:03:50.896
MATT: Oh, you did, so you can't--
SAM: But I didn't actually

03:03:50.896 --> 03:03:53.799
get to take my action last turn.

03:03:53.799 --> 03:03:57.587
I started to walk, and then I fell, but I never actually

03:03:57.587 --> 03:03:59.129
took an action.
MATT: That's true, that's true,

03:03:59.129 --> 03:04:01.009
so what would you do with your action?

03:04:01.009 --> 03:04:04.279
SAM: There's not a lot I can do from inside.

03:04:04.279 --> 03:04:07.739
I'm prone. Do I have the ability to move my arms and things?

03:04:07.739 --> 03:04:09.737
MATT: You do.
SAM: Or am I oozed?

03:04:09.737 --> 03:04:12.039
I'm going to do the same goddamn thing

03:04:12.039 --> 03:04:13.339
and throw some more buttons up

03:04:13.339 --> 03:04:15.879
and try to hypnotize them again.

03:04:15.879 --> 03:04:18.119
MATT: Okay, since this technically goes first,

03:04:18.119 --> 03:04:21.339
if this works, then you will not take the damage

03:04:21.339 --> 03:04:23.522
I just told you to take.

03:04:23.522 --> 03:04:26.549
So the save is wisdom, correct?

03:04:26.549 --> 03:04:28.829
SAM: Yes.

03:04:28.829 --> 03:04:30.479
MATT: And that's against him or both?

03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:34.062
SAM: It says that it can do it,

03:04:36.109 --> 03:04:38.289
any creature within 30 feet.

03:04:38.289 --> 03:04:39.612
MATT: Okay, singular creature?

03:04:40.789 --> 03:04:42.172
SAM: Ah, sorry.

03:04:43.859 --> 03:04:44.699
MATT: Just double-checking.

03:04:44.699 --> 03:04:47.449
SAM: Yep, each creature in the area who sees the pattern

03:04:47.449 --> 03:04:49.812
must make a wisdom saving throw.

03:04:49.812 --> 03:04:53.079
MATT: A 30-foot cube, okay.

03:04:53.079 --> 03:04:54.919
SAM: So that includes my friends?

03:04:54.919 --> 03:04:57.860
MATT: It would because you haven't seen them arrive.

03:04:57.860 --> 03:04:59.343
SAM: Yes, yes, sure, sure, sure.

03:04:59.343 --> 03:05:00.439
MARISHA: It's a wisdom save?

03:05:00.439 --> 03:05:01.272
MATT: Indeed.

03:05:01.272 --> 03:05:02.531
TALIESIN: And you can always tap them

03:05:02.531 --> 03:05:04.231
to wake them up.
MATT: They both fail.

03:05:05.219 --> 03:05:07.419
Both of you guys, roll wisdom saving throws.

03:05:08.373 --> 03:05:09.289
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

03:05:09.289 --> 03:05:10.919
SAM: Good news, bad news.

03:05:10.919 --> 03:05:12.798
LAURA: 27.
MARISHA: Natural one.

03:05:12.798 --> 03:05:14.819
SAM: (laughs)
LAURA: Great!

03:05:14.819 --> 03:05:16.109
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

03:05:16.109 --> 03:05:17.359
LIAM: Tonight, at The Vortex.

03:05:17.359 --> 03:05:21.777
MARISHA: So, as, yeah, a flashing LED glow stick falls,

03:05:21.777 --> 03:05:24.579
and then you throw some buttons.

03:05:24.579 --> 03:05:26.539
MATT: The buttons explode--
MARISHA: And hypnotize me.

03:05:26.539 --> 03:05:28.243
MATT: -- in a splash of color and light,

03:05:28.243 --> 03:05:30.899
(whooshing) like a small, localized firework,

03:05:30.899 --> 03:05:33.809
and suddenly the creatures just go limp

03:05:33.809 --> 03:05:36.071
for a moment, and Beau stands there, staring into it.

03:05:36.071 --> 03:05:37.859
SAM: Beau's in a K-hole!
LIAM: Yeah.

03:05:37.859 --> 03:05:40.449
(laughter)

03:05:40.449 --> 03:05:42.987
Memories of Hupperdook.

03:05:42.987 --> 03:05:45.199
MATT: (laughs) All right.
LAURA: Okay, wait, wait, wait.

03:05:45.199 --> 03:05:46.032
MATT: That finishes their turn.

03:05:46.032 --> 03:05:47.799
We're back at the top of the initiative round.

03:05:47.799 --> 03:05:49.129
Before we get there, what's everybody else doing?

03:05:49.129 --> 03:05:50.469
You said you are?

03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:53.549
LIAM: I grab Yasha and Fjord and just jumped

03:05:53.549 --> 03:05:56.479
as a giant eagle, so I would use.

03:05:56.479 --> 03:05:57.312
MATT: What's the speed of the eagle?

03:05:57.312 --> 03:05:58.239
LIAM: 80 feet.

03:05:58.239 --> 03:05:59.409
MATT: So you can go 160 feet.

03:05:59.409 --> 03:06:02.799
LIAM: Right, which I imagine's just a straight dive fall

03:06:02.799 --> 03:06:04.829
for most of the, and then the wings go out

03:06:04.829 --> 03:06:07.299
like a drag parachute towards the end of that run.

03:06:07.299 --> 03:06:09.939
MATT: You got it, all righty, so you're still

03:06:09.939 --> 03:06:13.209
about a little over 100 feet above them,

03:06:13.209 --> 03:06:15.149
and since I don't have my eagle mini close to me

03:06:15.149 --> 03:06:16.799
and I can't grab right now, we're going to be using a frog.

03:06:16.799 --> 03:06:18.715
Same difference.
LIAM: Just imagine it.

03:06:18.715 --> 03:06:21.776
MATT: Imagination, but yeah, you are currently now up

03:06:21.776 --> 03:06:23.529
in the air, trying to make your way down

03:06:23.529 --> 03:06:25.129
to join the fray with the two of them.

03:06:25.129 --> 03:06:26.179
Caduceus, what are you doing?

03:06:26.179 --> 03:06:29.499
TALIESIN: I am sitting up there. God, what can I do?

03:06:29.499 --> 03:06:31.209
There's nothing I can, I'm too weak

03:06:31.209 --> 03:06:32.684
to go down there.
SAM and LAURA: Heal thyself!

03:06:32.684 --> 03:06:34.089
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to take a heal.

03:06:34.089 --> 03:06:35.746
MATT: Go for it.

03:06:35.746 --> 03:06:37.430
SAM: This is the worst foam party ever.

03:06:37.430 --> 03:06:40.769
(laughter)

03:06:40.769 --> 03:06:42.559
TALIESIN: Yeah, just assume I'm going to heal myself.

03:06:42.559 --> 03:06:46.403
MARISHA: Well, this was supposed to be like, a... Eh.

03:06:46.403 --> 03:06:48.339
MATT: Okay, Jester,

03:06:48.339 --> 03:06:49.353
you're up first.
MARISHA: I was going to make

03:06:49.353 --> 03:06:50.186
a gross joke.
LAURA: I'm going to use my

03:06:50.186 --> 03:06:52.039
Ring of Spell Splitting.

03:06:52.039 --> 03:06:56.129
I'm going to cast Polymorph on Nott, on Veth,

03:06:56.129 --> 03:06:59.769
and on myself, and I'm going to
turn us both into giant eagles.

03:06:59.769 --> 03:07:00.602
SAM: Oh no.

03:07:01.669 --> 03:07:02.502
MATT: Okay.

03:07:03.949 --> 03:07:05.632
LAURA: Sorry, Matt.
MATT: It's okay!

03:07:06.559 --> 03:07:08.738
I, if you give me a second, I can go grab some--

03:07:08.738 --> 03:07:10.780
LAURA: Go do it, go do it!
MATT: I'll be right back.

03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:11.969
I'm going to grab some giant eagles.

03:07:11.969 --> 03:07:14.116
TRAVIS: This battle map brought to you by--

03:07:14.116 --> 03:07:15.129
SAM: Oh, yeah.

03:07:15.129 --> 03:07:18.975
I threw it away, but it's
Dwarven Forge something or other.

03:07:18.975 --> 03:07:22.706
Check it out at dwarvenforge.com!

03:07:24.134 --> 03:07:25.092
TRAVIS: Can't dive by Nick--

03:07:25.092 --> 03:07:26.133
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god!
SAM: They have,

03:07:26.133 --> 03:07:27.899
they have new things!

03:07:29.574 --> 03:07:31.078
TALIESIN: All right, let's see.

03:07:31.078 --> 03:07:33.360
TRAVIS: Objection!
SAM: There's objection.

03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:34.960
MARISHA: Was that Phoenix Wright?

03:07:34.960 --> 03:07:36.272
Are these just old? (laughs)

03:07:36.272 --> 03:07:37.306
LIAM: Old bits.

03:07:37.306 --> 03:07:40.139
MARISHA: Old bits?
SAM: Just old bits.

03:07:40.139 --> 03:07:41.989
LAURA: You keep freaking out.

03:07:41.989 --> 03:07:43.390
SAM: Here's a bit I don't think I did.

03:07:43.390 --> 03:07:46.475
I don't think I ever did this bit.

03:07:46.475 --> 03:07:48.309
But it would've been real funny!

03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:50.029
MARISHA: No, no, no, wait, you did.

03:07:50.029 --> 03:07:52.720
MARISHA: What did you-- no?
LIAM: The eagles are coming!

03:07:52.720 --> 03:07:54.169
The eagles are coming!
MARISHA: You used that for something!

03:07:54.169 --> 03:07:56.599
TALIESIN: Almost half my hit points, thank god.

03:07:56.599 --> 03:07:57.559
LAURA: Yay!
SAM: (jingling)

03:07:57.559 --> 03:08:00.259
MARISHA: I might've used some of that for Hazel Copperpot.

03:08:00.259 --> 03:08:01.839
I might have stolen some of that.
ASHLEY: That looks familiar.

03:08:01.839 --> 03:08:03.688
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: The eagles are here!

03:08:03.688 --> 03:08:05.809
MATT: That works just fine, so.

03:08:05.809 --> 03:08:09.149
SAM: ♪ Welcome to the Hotel California ♪

03:08:09.149 --> 03:08:13.489
LAURA: Ooh, I'm a griffon or something!

03:08:13.489 --> 03:08:15.579
MATT: It's more of a sphinx.
LAURA: I'm a sphinx.

03:08:15.579 --> 03:08:16.529
MATT: You get the idea.

03:08:17.509 --> 03:08:21.343
Say for this purpose here you are

03:08:22.889 --> 03:08:26.840
right there, though, okay.

03:08:26.840 --> 03:08:28.449
Put these back here.

03:08:28.449 --> 03:08:32.477
So you are now both giant eagles.

03:08:32.477 --> 03:08:36.579
LAURA: I'm going to-- Can I use my movement still?

03:08:36.579 --> 03:08:38.589
MATT: You can because you only used your action.

03:08:38.589 --> 03:08:41.189
LAURA: For my movement, can I grab Beau and lift up

03:08:41.189 --> 03:08:42.439
off the ground?

03:08:46.289 --> 03:08:48.213
MATT: You would need your action to grab her

03:08:48.213 --> 03:08:50.429
because it is, like, a grab and then a move,

03:08:50.429 --> 03:08:52.692
so unfortunately not.

03:08:53.538 --> 03:08:55.253
LAURA: Hoh, okay.
MARISHA: I'm okay.

03:08:55.253 --> 03:08:56.759
I'm having a great time.

03:08:56.759 --> 03:08:58.059
MATT: She's just space raving.

03:08:59.553 --> 03:09:03.169
(laughter)

03:09:03.169 --> 03:09:04.666
LAURA: Then I'm going to-- oh god.

03:09:04.666 --> 03:09:06.526
(laughter)

03:09:06.526 --> 03:09:07.776
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:09:14.956 --> 03:09:15.789
TRAVIS: Under control.

03:09:15.789 --> 03:09:18.737
LAURA: I'm going to... fly up.
SAM: Episode title:

03:09:18.737 --> 03:09:21.103
The Quiff of Death.
LAURA: Fuck me running.

03:09:23.444 --> 03:09:26.605
I'm going to step in front of Beau.

03:09:26.605 --> 03:09:27.691
SAM: Step?

03:09:27.691 --> 03:09:29.834
MATT: Unfortunately, there's no
space to step in front of her,

03:09:29.834 --> 03:09:32.503
because that space is occupied by the other creature.

03:09:32.503 --> 03:09:33.754
LAURA: Then I'm just going to take my wing

03:09:33.754 --> 03:09:36.015
and bring it down in front of her.

03:09:36.015 --> 03:09:37.125
MATT: There you go.

03:09:37.125 --> 03:09:38.671
Not my child!
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:38.671 --> 03:09:40.962
MATT: You got it. All right, that finishes your go.

03:09:40.962 --> 03:09:42.457
TRAVIS: Oh no. (laughter)

03:09:42.457 --> 03:09:43.333
MATT: Beau.

03:09:43.333 --> 03:09:44.581
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:09:44.581 --> 03:09:46.080
Yep.
TRAVIS: Get that girl some orange juice.

03:09:46.080 --> 03:09:47.590
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:09:49.551 --> 03:09:50.534
Do you need some water?
MATT: Yeah,

03:09:50.534 --> 03:09:51.933
you're just standing there.

03:09:51.933 --> 03:09:53.843
That's your turn.

03:09:53.843 --> 03:09:55.242
Veth, you're an eagle.

03:09:55.242 --> 03:09:58.343
SAM: I'm an eagle, but we're not allowed to pick up Beau?

03:09:58.343 --> 03:09:59.642
Is that--
LAURA: No, you can for your action.

03:09:59.642 --> 03:10:02.226
SAM: Oh, okay, I'll go pick up Beau.

03:10:02.226 --> 03:10:04.932
Well, first I got to get out of the ooze, I guess,

03:10:04.932 --> 03:10:06.404
with my wings and stuff.

03:10:06.404 --> 03:10:08.238
MATT: Okay, well, you know you-- (whoosh)

03:10:08.238 --> 03:10:09.601
you burst out of its space.

03:10:09.601 --> 03:10:12.250
SAM: I just want to do it so that I don't harm the ooze.

03:10:12.250 --> 03:10:14.333
So this is a gentle lift.

03:10:15.578 --> 03:10:18.480
MATT: Easy enough to do because
it's incapacitated, no issue.

03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:20.938
SAM: And then I will grab Beau, gently,

03:10:20.938 --> 03:10:24.378
with my razor sharp claws.

03:10:24.378 --> 03:10:25.480
MATT: All righty.

03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:27.160
MARISHA: (whining) No, I'm not ready to go.

03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:28.240
(laughter)

03:10:28.240 --> 03:10:30.658
SAM: Oh, honey.
(laughter)

03:10:30.658 --> 03:10:33.109
MARISHA: (whining) Just 30 more minutes.

03:10:33.109 --> 03:10:36.789
SAM: And I will fly up into the air.

03:10:36.789 --> 03:10:38.417
MATT: Okay.

03:10:38.417 --> 03:10:40.729
TRAVIS: Wait til this beat drops.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:10:40.729 --> 03:10:42.908
Wait, wait, wait, this is my jam.

03:10:42.908 --> 03:10:44.177
MATT: So with that,

03:10:44.177 --> 03:10:47.132
you can lift up the speed of the giant eagle, which is--?

03:10:47.132 --> 03:10:48.066
SAM: Looking, looking.

03:10:48.066 --> 03:10:49.123
LAURA: 80 feet.
SAM: Thank you.

03:10:49.123 --> 03:10:50.510
MATT: So you're now 80 feet up.

03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:51.929
You see a giant eagle beginning to--

03:10:51.929 --> 03:10:53.662
LIAM: We're, like, probably 30 feet apart at this point.

03:10:53.662 --> 03:10:57.338
MATT: Yeah, you are 30 feet apart.
(mini clatters) Oh god.

03:10:57.338 --> 03:10:59.789
TRAVIS: Ah, oh, no!
SAM: Oh no!

03:10:59.789 --> 03:11:01.826
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: Everything's over!

03:11:01.826 --> 03:11:04.642
Hold on, I got to put this plastic thing up in...

03:11:04.642 --> 03:11:05.975
this eagle cooch.

03:11:05.975 --> 03:11:07.473
Okay, there we go.
(laughter)

03:11:07.473 --> 03:11:08.306
LIAM: Wow.

03:11:09.181 --> 03:11:10.023
Wow.

03:11:10.023 --> 03:11:11.506
This is the year we reclaim our dignity.

03:11:11.506 --> 03:11:14.346
(laughter)

03:11:14.346 --> 03:11:15.256
MATT: All righty, so...

SAM: ♪ Let the eagle soar ♪

03:11:18.802 --> 03:11:20.154
MATT: This has been a night.

(laughter)

03:11:24.423 --> 03:11:25.672
SAM: Symbol of our country.

MATT: There we go.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:30.753
MATT: Did it.

03:11:30.753 --> 03:11:32.143
LAURA: You did it!

03:11:32.143 --> 03:11:34.243
MATT: That finishes Veth's turn.

03:11:34.243 --> 03:11:36.953
They can't go, because they're charmed.

03:11:36.953 --> 03:11:38.641
Just sit there.

03:11:38.641 --> 03:11:40.317

MATT: Yep.

03:11:42.442 --> 03:11:43.658
All right.

Caleb.

03:11:47.492 --> 03:11:48.700
LIAM: I don't know what to make of it,

03:11:48.700 --> 03:11:50.127
because I just came rocketing

03:11:50.127 --> 03:11:51.987
down from the top, and there's birds down here.

03:11:51.987 --> 03:11:53.120
MATT: Yeah, and you just see a giant eagle

03:11:53.120 --> 03:11:54.720
flying up, clutching Beauregard,

03:11:54.720 --> 03:11:56.409
who's just limp in its grasp.

03:11:56.409 --> 03:11:57.470
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Whoa!

03:11:57.470 --> 03:11:59.649
MARISHA: "And there's birds down here."
LIAM: So I'm going to do my best

03:11:59.649 --> 03:12:02.529
to brake, and not smash into everybody,

03:12:02.529 --> 03:12:04.068
and I can't do anything except fly.

03:12:04.068 --> 03:12:05.522
I'm just the lift, at this point.

03:12:05.522 --> 03:12:07.296
So that's it.
MATT: Yeah, you could drop them off if you wanted to.

03:12:07.296 --> 03:12:10.523
TRAVIS: Yasha and I are like (screaming).

03:12:10.523 --> 03:12:11.671
MATT: If you're trying to get to the bottom,

03:12:11.671 --> 03:12:12.998
or you're staying where you are?

03:12:12.998 --> 03:12:14.347
LIAM: Well, I'm seeing eagles come up,

03:12:14.347 --> 03:12:15.688
and I'm assuming,

03:12:15.688 --> 03:12:16.787
in my dumb eagle state,

03:12:16.787 --> 03:12:18.375
that there weren't eagles down there,

03:12:18.375 --> 03:12:19.576
so these must be my friends.

03:12:19.576 --> 03:12:22.086
So I am just going to fly down

03:12:22.086 --> 03:12:25.117
to whatever height they're at.
MARISHA: You don't know.

03:12:25.117 --> 03:12:26.144
LIAM: That's fair, that's fair.

03:12:26.144 --> 03:12:29.456
MATT: Okay, you can fly about
30 feet above with your movement,

03:12:29.456 --> 03:12:32.227
or you can go the full distance with your action.

03:12:32.227 --> 03:12:33.558
LIAM: I don't want to go to the bottom,

03:12:33.558 --> 03:12:36.867
I want to stop with my eagle friends.

03:12:36.867 --> 03:12:37.908
MATT: Got it, okay.

03:12:37.908 --> 03:12:40.883
SAM: The only two people who can talk are Yasha and Fjord.

03:12:40.883 --> 03:12:43.916
Oh wait, and I guess Caduceus.
MATT: There is an eagle friend,

03:12:43.916 --> 03:12:45.295
and that is at 80 feet up,

03:12:45.295 --> 03:12:46.386
and that's the first one you see with Beau.

03:12:46.386 --> 03:12:47.219
LIAM: Right.

03:12:47.219 --> 03:12:49.099
MATT: There's a second eagle at
the bottom you can barely see.

03:12:49.099 --> 03:12:50.998
It's at the very bottom.
So which one are you going with?

03:12:50.998 --> 03:12:52.155
Eagle friends are at two different places.

03:12:52.155 --> 03:12:54.022
LIAM: I will pass the first eagle friend,

03:12:54.022 --> 03:12:56.429
and go down between the two eagle friends,

03:12:56.429 --> 03:12:58.013
to try to ascertain what's going on.

03:12:58.013 --> 03:12:59.534
MATT: All right, so you are 40 feet above,

03:12:59.534 --> 03:13:00.536
we'll say.
LIAM: There we go.

03:13:00.536 --> 03:13:01.438
MATT: So as you're 40 feet above,

03:13:01.438 --> 03:13:03.598
holding Fjord and Yasha--
LIAM: Let's do 50 feet.

03:13:03.598 --> 03:13:05.549
MATT: All right, 50 feet above.

03:13:05.549 --> 03:13:07.208
As you're flying there, clutching both of them,

03:13:07.208 --> 03:13:11.265
you look down, and you see these two writhing black oozes.

03:13:11.265 --> 03:13:12.576
LIAM: (squawk)
MATT: And you see a third eagle

03:13:12.576 --> 03:13:15.167
on the bottom with its, like, wings out.

03:13:15.167 --> 03:13:16.383
LAURA: I'm blue!

03:13:16.383 --> 03:13:18.773
MATT: A blue eagle, if you will.

03:13:18.773 --> 03:13:21.022
TRAVIS: "I'm blue!"
MATT: All righty, so that's your turn.

03:13:21.022 --> 03:13:22.213
Anybody else going to do anything?

03:13:22.213 --> 03:13:24.365
You guys are just being held by the giant eagle 50 feet up.

03:13:24.365 --> 03:13:29.024
ASHLEY: Wait, wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-what is happening?

03:13:29.024 --> 03:13:30.684
Who are you f-- (sighs)

03:13:30.684 --> 03:13:33.917
TRAVIS: Yeah, if we hit it, it'll become uncharmed, right?

03:13:33.917 --> 03:13:36.108
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: We don't want to do that.

03:13:36.108 --> 03:13:38.412
ASHLEY: But should we look around the room?

03:13:38.412 --> 03:13:41.565
There's a big white floofy thing.

03:13:41.565 --> 03:13:42.661
I wonder if we could--

03:13:42.661 --> 03:13:44.366
LAURA: Maybe there's a doorway behind it?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:13:44.366 --> 03:13:45.973
LIAM: Yeah, exactly.

03:13:45.973 --> 03:13:47.873
This could be the way forward.

03:13:49.235 --> 03:13:52.379
TALIESIN: Is that not the dead bodies that--

03:13:52.379 --> 03:13:54.079
No, maybe not.

03:13:54.079 --> 03:13:57.133
ASHLEY: I mean, we could try to give it a look-see,

03:13:57.133 --> 03:13:58.493
if you want to--

03:13:58.493 --> 03:13:59.457
LIAM: (squawks)

03:13:59.457 --> 03:14:01.944
TRAVIS: Well, how long are they charmed for?

03:14:01.944 --> 03:14:05.019
SAM: You don't know, unfortunately.
TRAVIS: Yeah, they save every round, right?

03:14:05.019 --> 03:14:06.902
We should be trying to smoke these things, right?
ASHLEY: Here's the thing, Fjord,

03:14:06.902 --> 03:14:08.595
I can probably get us out of here.

03:14:08.595 --> 03:14:09.963
SAM: If you see my buttons floating around,

03:14:09.963 --> 03:14:12.203
you know that those typically last a minute.

03:14:12.203 --> 03:14:15.705
TRAVIS: Okay.
(laughter)

03:14:15.705 --> 03:14:18.595
ASHLEY: We all just die down here
because we just can't leave.

03:14:18.595 --> 03:14:20.784
(laughter)

03:14:20.784 --> 03:14:22.883
MARISHA: It puts the lotion on its skin.

03:14:22.883 --> 03:14:25.133
(laughter)

03:14:26.595 --> 03:14:27.699
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

03:14:27.699 --> 03:14:29.282
You holding?
LIAM: Waffling.

03:14:30.759 --> 03:14:32.585
ASHLEY: Fjord, what do you want to do?

03:14:32.585 --> 03:14:33.584
SAM: (squawks)
TRAVIS: Are we trying to

03:14:33.584 --> 03:14:36.767
get out of here, and regroup up at the top?

03:14:37.774 --> 03:14:38.794
LAURA: Maybe.

03:14:38.794 --> 03:14:40.320
TRAVIS: Yeah?
MARISHA: I feel weightless.

03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:41.153
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

03:14:41.153 --> 03:14:42.464
Let's regroup at the top.
TALIESIN: I'm spending some time

03:14:42.464 --> 03:14:44.639
looking around, figuring out
what the fuck is going on up there.

03:14:44.639 --> 03:14:45.547
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:14:45.547 --> 03:14:47.435
TALIESIN: All right.

03:14:47.435 --> 03:14:48.870
LAURA: Because we can send, like, fireballs down,

03:14:48.870 --> 03:14:51.736
and try to knock 'em out, you know.

03:14:51.736 --> 03:14:55.533
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just shout out:
Regroup, meet back up at the top.

03:14:55.533 --> 03:14:56.683
SAM: It's just you and Yasha.

03:14:56.683 --> 03:14:58.185
TALIESIN: 25.
LAURA: We can understand.

03:14:58.185 --> 03:14:59.018
MATT: You understand.
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:14:59.018 --> 03:15:01.817
TRAVIS: Damn eagles!
MATT: 25? Okay.

03:15:01.817 --> 03:15:06.450
Best you call tell, this chamber is collapsed enough

03:15:06.450 --> 03:15:10.107
where you cannot ascertain any other position of exit.

03:15:10.107 --> 03:15:14.529
You could do a more intense search if there was a floor,

03:15:14.529 --> 03:15:17.136
but you're having to just look from a lightless expanse,

03:15:17.136 --> 03:15:18.370
and you have no lights.
TALIESIN: I have a light.

03:15:18.370 --> 03:15:20.754
MATT: Oh, you have light from there.
So you do have a little light to see, yeah.

03:15:20.754 --> 03:15:22.970
But nothing at this distance,

03:15:22.970 --> 03:15:25.125
like, at a glance, looks like an exit.

03:15:25.125 --> 03:15:27.456
TRAVIS: No white spider coming up behind you, right?

03:15:27.456 --> 03:15:28.289
MATT: Jester.

03:15:28.289 --> 03:15:29.515
TALIESIN: No, we would hear the trigger.

03:15:29.515 --> 03:15:31.085
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: You fly up?

03:15:31.085 --> 03:15:32.707
LAURA: Sure.

03:15:32.707 --> 03:15:33.725
MATT: All right, and so with that,

03:15:33.725 --> 03:15:35.507
Jester comes and joins the other eagles.

03:15:35.507 --> 03:15:37.257
Now you have these three eagles in this tunnel.

03:15:37.257 --> 03:15:39.096
It's a very tight space, by the way.

03:15:39.096 --> 03:15:41.707
That's as wide as the entire thing is, so you're all, like,

03:15:41.707 --> 03:15:43.707
having to carefully--
TRAVIS: Fuck.

03:15:43.707 --> 03:15:44.907
MATT: -- stay far away from each other,

03:15:44.907 --> 03:15:47.025
and not fuck with your flight patterns here.

03:15:47.025 --> 03:15:49.407
TRAVIS: Going back up to the top, back up to the top!

03:15:49.407 --> 03:15:51.646
MATT: (wings flapping)

03:15:51.646 --> 03:15:54.601
One after another, you all slowly spiral your way back up.

03:15:54.601 --> 03:15:55.980
And Caduceus, as you're sitting there looking,

03:15:55.980 --> 03:15:59.074
all of a sudden you glance down and see three massive eagles

03:15:59.074 --> 03:16:00.948
(whooshing) fly up in your space,

03:16:00.948 --> 03:16:03.772
and you have to step back because
they have to perch immediately.

03:16:03.772 --> 03:16:05.988
Since there's nothing else to grab a hold onto.

03:16:05.988 --> 03:16:07.604
TALIESIN: Since you're here, somebody should take a look

03:16:07.604 --> 03:16:08.756
at the other side of this.
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was

03:16:08.756 --> 03:16:10.137
planning on doing, actually--
TALIESIN: Since y'all fly.

03:16:10.137 --> 03:16:11.834
LAURA: -- is flying next to the wall,

03:16:11.834 --> 03:16:13.842
and see if I can spot any

03:16:13.842 --> 03:16:15.651
openings on the other side.
MATT: So you head over there.

03:16:15.651 --> 03:16:18.307
Make a perception check with the eagle's perception.

03:16:18.307 --> 03:16:19.556
LAURA: Okay.

03:16:21.583 --> 03:16:23.799
MATT: And they have keen sight, which
gives you an advantage, I believe.

03:16:23.799 --> 03:16:27.896
LAURA: Keen sight, okay, what is--

03:16:27.896 --> 03:16:30.156
LIAM: Advantage that rely on sight, yeah.

03:16:30.156 --> 03:16:31.797
LAURA: Is that a wisdom?
LIAM: Wisdom perception.

03:16:31.797 --> 03:16:33.065
LAURA: Wisdom? Okay.

03:16:33.065 --> 03:16:35.345
MATT: Just go for that.

03:16:37.404 --> 03:16:39.631
LAURA: Ooh-woo-woo.

03:16:39.631 --> 03:16:40.805
18.

03:16:40.805 --> 03:16:43.902
MATT: 18, looking about this area,

03:16:43.902 --> 03:16:47.632
you're hard pressed to find anything beyond the rubble.

03:16:47.632 --> 03:16:49.543
LAURA: Okay.

03:16:49.543 --> 03:16:51.472
So it's probably at the bottom.

03:16:52.388 --> 03:16:54.501
TRAVIS: I know we just busted out all these amazing spells

03:16:54.501 --> 03:16:56.588
to get down there and come right back up,

03:16:56.588 --> 03:16:58.831
but should we rest for a second?

03:16:58.831 --> 03:16:59.829
LAURA: Mm.

03:16:59.829 --> 03:17:00.855
MARISHA: Now that we know.

03:17:00.855 --> 03:17:04.071
TALIESIN: The eagles are only going to last so long.

03:17:04.071 --> 03:17:05.167
LIAM: A while.

03:17:05.167 --> 03:17:08.021
TALIESIN: And if anybody with some--

03:17:08.021 --> 03:17:09.762
doesn't have to get right up in it,

03:17:09.762 --> 03:17:14.341
we can hang from the eagles, maybe, and take shots.

03:17:14.341 --> 03:17:16.345
Stay out of the range of them.
TRAVIS: I mean, yeah,

03:17:16.345 --> 03:17:18.671
I have ranged stuff, I could do that.

03:17:18.671 --> 03:17:19.504
TALIESIN: Ditto.

03:17:20.749 --> 03:17:22.983
MARISHA: I could do my lightning gloves.

03:17:22.983 --> 03:17:24.250
SAM: (squawks)

03:17:24.250 --> 03:17:26.559
TALIESIN: Oh, you're-- yeah, never mind.

03:17:26.559 --> 03:17:28.469
LAURA: I'll grab Fjord,

03:17:28.469 --> 03:17:29.738
and fly back down?

03:17:29.738 --> 03:17:30.749
TRAVIS: Yeah, anybody else want to come

03:17:30.749 --> 03:17:31.582
with ranged stuff?
LAURA: So that he can shoot at them

03:17:31.582 --> 03:17:32.469
from a distance.
TRAVIS: You?

03:17:32.469 --> 03:17:34.130
TALIESIN: I'll come.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:17:34.130 --> 03:17:34.963
The two of us.

03:17:34.963 --> 03:17:36.746
SAM: I'll-- yeah-- do you need a--

03:17:36.746 --> 03:17:37.754
(squawks)

03:17:37.754 --> 03:17:39.366
(laughter)

03:17:39.366 --> 03:17:41.199
ASHLEY: I'll hop onto Caleb.

03:17:42.492 --> 03:17:43.584
MARISHA: Has it been a minute?

03:17:43.584 --> 03:17:45.495
Am I still hypnotized?

03:17:45.495 --> 03:17:47.503
MATT: No, your hypnosis has now broken.

03:17:47.503 --> 03:17:49.023
MARISHA: Okay.

03:17:49.023 --> 03:17:50.975
MATT: And everyone's talking, and
you're like, "What's going on?"

03:17:50.975 --> 03:17:53.055
MARISHA: What's the plan? What do you want me to do?

03:17:53.055 --> 03:17:55.064
TALIESIN: We're going to take
distanced shots at these things.

03:17:55.064 --> 03:17:57.545
We're going to stay at least, you know--

03:17:57.545 --> 03:18:01.785
LIAM: I'm going to land us on the lip at the top,

03:18:01.785 --> 03:18:04.412
and (whooshing) back into human form,

03:18:04.412 --> 03:18:07.796
and say: Sorry, we need to switch. (whooshing)

03:18:07.796 --> 03:18:10.245
And I turn you into a giant eagle.

03:18:10.245 --> 03:18:12.747
MATT: So Yasha is a giant eagle.
ASHLEY: Yes!

03:18:12.747 --> 03:18:15.293
LIAM: Yeah, and I climb on your back.

03:18:15.293 --> 03:18:16.699
MARISHA: And then I go in front of Yasha.

03:18:16.699 --> 03:18:17.532
Take me.

03:18:19.242 --> 03:18:20.663
TRAVIS: ♪ These broken wings ♪

03:18:20.663 --> 03:18:22.625
(laughter)

03:18:23.483 --> 03:18:27.713
MATT: Okay, so Yasha has Beau in one claw,

03:18:27.713 --> 03:18:30.663
and Caleb on the back, okay.

03:18:30.663 --> 03:18:33.171
TRAVIS: And Jester's taking--
LAURA: I'll let Fjord climb on my back.

03:18:33.171 --> 03:18:35.154
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: And I'll fly down,

03:18:35.154 --> 03:18:36.620
so you can have your arms free for--

03:18:36.620 --> 03:18:39.254
TRAVIS: Oh, I let you fly, now you let me fly.
LAURA: Yes!

03:18:39.254 --> 03:18:40.922

LIAM: Crisscross, crisscross.

TRAVIS: ♪ Make it jump, jump ♪
MATT: Oh, I love that movie.

03:18:43.482 --> 03:18:44.987
All righty.

03:18:44.987 --> 03:18:47.843
(intense music)

03:18:47.843 --> 03:18:49.260
LIAM: (with the music) Ba-donk-a-donk.

03:18:51.867 --> 03:18:53.906
TRAVIS: There better not be anymore
of these on the walls on the way down.

03:18:53.906 --> 03:18:57.567
MATT: So as you guys, now you've all got up onto it,

03:18:57.567 --> 03:19:01.310
you begin to (whooshing) fly down, and as you do,

03:19:01.310 --> 03:19:04.889
about 140 feet up the side of the cavern wall,

03:19:04.889 --> 03:19:05.977
both of them--
SAM: Oh!

03:19:05.977 --> 03:19:08.750
MATT: Who have been broken from it are-- (glopping)

03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:09.583
LAURA: Okay, okay.

03:19:09.583 --> 03:19:10.941
MARISHA: Shit.
MATT: Climbing up the side.

03:19:10.941 --> 03:19:12.434
MARISHA: I-- before we get close,

03:19:12.434 --> 03:19:15.212
I'm going to take out my gloves and (smashing)

03:19:15.212 --> 03:19:16.747
smash and turn on my lightning gloves.

03:19:16.747 --> 03:19:17.964
MATT: You got it.

03:19:17.964 --> 03:19:18.806
LAURA: Go, Fjord.

03:19:18.806 --> 03:19:20.437
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: (impacts)

03:19:20.437 --> 03:19:22.512
MATT: Go ahead and roll for attack.

03:19:23.408 --> 03:19:24.957
TRAVIS: That's a 24.

03:19:24.957 --> 03:19:25.790
MATT: Hits.

03:19:25.790 --> 03:19:26.623
TRAVIS: 20.

03:19:26.623 --> 03:19:27.483
MATT: Hits.

03:19:27.483 --> 03:19:28.481
TRAVIS: And a 28.

03:19:28.481 --> 03:19:29.605
MATT: Hits!

03:19:29.605 --> 03:19:31.300
All against a single target?

03:19:31.300 --> 03:19:32.859
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: All right, go for it.

03:19:33.775 --> 03:19:36.700
TRAVIS: That is 10 plus five, 15.

03:19:38.271 --> 03:19:40.710
14, so 24,

03:19:40.710 --> 03:19:43.960
and seven for 30--

03:19:45.178 --> 03:19:46.130
What was I going to say?

03:19:46.130 --> 03:19:46.963
31.

03:19:46.963 --> 03:19:49.023
MATT: 31 points of force damage to it.

03:19:49.023 --> 03:19:50.231
(crashing) As it impacts,

03:19:50.231 --> 03:19:51.631
you see little bits splattering off of it.

03:19:51.631 --> 03:19:53.579
It's still-- momentum is carrying

03:19:53.579 --> 03:19:54.675
as it's climbing up the sides.

03:19:54.675 --> 03:19:55.901
So it shrugs it off.

03:19:55.901 --> 03:19:58.212
It hits, but it's still moving.

03:19:58.212 --> 03:19:59.825
TRAVIS: Copy.
MATT: That finishes your go.

03:19:59.825 --> 03:20:00.891
What are you doing?

03:20:00.891 --> 03:20:02.437
MARISHA: I'm going to just pop, pop.

03:20:02.437 --> 03:20:03.878
I'm going to hit it with my lightning gloves.

03:20:03.878 --> 03:20:04.961
MATT: You got it.

03:20:07.219 --> 03:20:11.500
MARISHA: Okay, that first one is a 26 to hit, and a 16.

03:20:11.500 --> 03:20:12.411
26 and 16.

03:20:12.411 --> 03:20:14.088
MATT: Both hit. On the same one that Fjord's going after,

03:20:14.088 --> 03:20:16.111
or the other one?

03:20:16.111 --> 03:20:17.140
MARISHA: I'll do the other one.

03:20:17.140 --> 03:20:17.973
MATT: Okay.

03:20:18.936 --> 03:20:21.789
MARISHA: Terrible damage rolls.

03:20:21.789 --> 03:20:24.026
10 damage and 11 damage.

03:20:24.026 --> 03:20:27.109
MATT: 10 damage and 11 damage, all right.

03:20:28.208 --> 03:20:29.288
You got it.

03:20:29.288 --> 03:20:32.714
So those two attacks,

03:20:32.714 --> 03:20:34.499
bolts fire out and pummel on the side.

03:20:34.499 --> 03:20:36.528
You watch as the lightning (sucking)

03:20:36.528 --> 03:20:39.960
doesn't do quite as much damage as you'd hope.

03:20:39.960 --> 03:20:41.509
Also, you watch as it quivers,

03:20:41.509 --> 03:20:44.357
(wobbling, tearing) and splits

03:20:44.357 --> 03:20:47.782
into two smaller black oozes.
SAM: What?

03:20:48.913 --> 03:20:50.408
LAURA: Does lightning do that?

03:20:50.408 --> 03:20:51.475
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:20:51.475 --> 03:20:53.577
(laughter)

03:20:53.577 --> 03:20:55.218
MATT: So now there are these two.

03:20:55.218 --> 03:20:56.209
SAM: She's done.

03:20:56.209 --> 03:20:57.530
MARISHA: Fuck.
MATT: And that there.

03:20:57.530 --> 03:20:58.907
MARISHA: Just let me be high again.

03:20:58.907 --> 03:21:00.419
(laughter)

03:21:00.419 --> 03:21:01.742
TRAVIS: Bring out the rave!
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:21:01.742 --> 03:21:03.437
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

03:21:03.437 --> 03:21:04.608
MARISHA: I still have my bonus action?

03:21:04.608 --> 03:21:07.179
I guess it didn't do as much damage as I thought?

03:21:07.179 --> 03:21:08.677
Like it's resistant?

03:21:08.677 --> 03:21:09.510
MATT: Possibly.

03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:10.907
LIAM: How close are we saying we are to these things?

03:21:10.907 --> 03:21:13.317
If you were doing that, that's like 10 or 15 feet away?

03:21:13.317 --> 03:21:14.816
MATT: 20 feet away, yeah.
LIAM: 20 feet away.

03:21:14.816 --> 03:21:16.728
MARISHA: I have a range of 20 feet with my gloves,

03:21:16.728 --> 03:21:18.024
so it can't be more than that.

03:21:18.024 --> 03:21:19.487
LIAM: Okay, okay.

03:21:19.487 --> 03:21:21.631
MARISHA: I might as well hit it again, I guess. Pop pop.

03:21:21.631 --> 03:21:22.769
MATT: Okay.

03:21:22.769 --> 03:21:25.157
MARISHA: A natural 20, and a natural 19.

03:21:25.157 --> 03:21:27.304
MATT: Both hit.

03:21:27.304 --> 03:21:29.909
MARISHA: Okay, so--
TRAVIS: You crit on 19s, too?

03:21:29.909 --> 03:21:31.717
MARISHA: I don't crit on 19s, no.

03:21:31.717 --> 03:21:34.435
No, that's your cool barbarian thing.

03:21:34.435 --> 03:21:37.749
For the natural 20, I rolled a seven on that damage,

03:21:37.749 --> 03:21:41.297
so 14 plus six is 20 damage.

03:21:41.297 --> 03:21:44.487
MATT: 20 damage, nice.
MARISHA: And then on the 19,

03:21:44.487 --> 03:21:48.196
a two plus six, so eight damage on the 19.

03:21:48.196 --> 03:21:49.279
MATT: All righty.

03:21:50.514 --> 03:21:52.546
Got it, so (punching).

03:21:52.546 --> 03:21:55.315
The two additional hits slam into it, doing damage,

03:21:55.315 --> 03:21:56.906
but you see it seems to be absorbing

03:21:56.906 --> 03:21:59.466
a portion of the lightning impact.

03:21:59.466 --> 03:22:02.047
MARISHA: Do those split in half?

03:22:02.047 --> 03:22:02.880
No.

03:22:05.495 --> 03:22:07.264
MATT: Is this all against one or both?

03:22:07.264 --> 03:22:09.157
MARISHA: Just the one.

03:22:09.157 --> 03:22:10.794
Oh, I shouldn't have reminded him.

03:22:10.794 --> 03:22:11.794
MATT: It's okay.

03:22:12.693 --> 03:22:13.526
TRAVIS: You fool.

03:22:13.526 --> 03:22:14.777
MATT: That should be plenty now.

03:22:14.777 --> 03:22:16.194
LIAM: Fly, you fools.

03:22:17.467 --> 03:22:19.548
SAM: Is anyone riding me right now?

03:22:19.548 --> 03:22:21.563
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:22:21.563 --> 03:22:23.377
LAURA: You have Caduceus.
SAM: I mean sexually.

03:22:23.377 --> 03:22:26.044
Okay, good.
(laughter)

03:22:27.105 --> 03:22:30.092
MATT: The one that you hit splits in two more, smaller.

03:22:30.092 --> 03:22:32.886
SAM: Ugh.
MATT: So now there are four.

03:22:32.886 --> 03:22:34.625
SAM: Triplets.
MARISHA: I don't know, is it me?

03:22:34.625 --> 03:22:35.862
Is it me, I don't know?
TRAVIS: And just to clarify,

03:22:35.862 --> 03:22:37.512
when I hit him with the Eldritch Blast,

03:22:37.512 --> 03:22:38.502
they didn't split, right?
MATT: Correct.

03:22:38.502 --> 03:22:40.371
MARISHA: I might need to just stop being.
LIAM: Yeah, I think it's the electricity.

03:22:40.371 --> 03:22:42.050
LAURA: It's lighting, don't lightning.

03:22:42.050 --> 03:22:44.408
TRAVIS: ♪ Save a horse, ride an eagle ♪

03:22:44.408 --> 03:22:46.078
(laughter)

03:22:46.078 --> 03:22:48.207
LIAM: Can I step in?

03:22:48.207 --> 03:22:50.347
MATT: You can.
LIAM: Okay, I will slap

03:22:50.347 --> 03:22:51.757
guano and sulfur together,

03:22:51.757 --> 03:22:54.016
and do a 5th-Level Fireball,

03:22:54.016 --> 03:22:56.465
and I will huck it 10 to 15 feet below them,

03:22:56.465 --> 03:22:59.865
so that it erupts upward, and tickles their gooch.

03:22:59.865 --> 03:23:00.699
MATT: You got it,

03:23:00.699 --> 03:23:01.956
and as such,

03:23:01.956 --> 03:23:03.776
fire on their gooches.

03:23:03.776 --> 03:23:05.418
TRAVIS: Rad.

03:23:05.418 --> 03:23:06.472
MATT: Fail.

03:23:07.947 --> 03:23:09.062
Fail.

03:23:10.311 --> 03:23:12.206
Fail.

03:23:12.206 --> 03:23:13.107
Fail, yeah,

03:23:13.107 --> 03:23:14.856
they got to roll a 20 to even to get close.

03:23:14.856 --> 03:23:18.240

ASHLEY: Wow.
LAURA: That's good.

03:23:22.736 --> 03:23:24.844
MATT: Both of the small ones that just split--
LAURA and SAM: Yay!

03:23:24.844 --> 03:23:26.677
MATT: -- incinerate immediately.

03:23:26.677 --> 03:23:29.036
LAURA: Oh, so it's a good thing!

03:23:29.036 --> 03:23:30.905
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: That you split them in half.

03:23:30.905 --> 03:23:33.785
MARISHA: Yeah, I did amazingly.

03:23:33.785 --> 03:23:35.011
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Big favor.

03:23:35.011 --> 03:23:36.887
TRAVIS: Yep, big time.
MARISHA: Yeah, I think it's good.

03:23:36.887 --> 03:23:37.720
I don't know,

03:23:37.720 --> 03:23:39.711
I have no idea.
MATT: The other one looks--

03:23:39.711 --> 03:23:40.902
it's barely holding on,

03:23:40.902 --> 03:23:43.082
as it's like (wet sucking)

03:23:43.082 --> 03:23:43.915
making its way up there.

03:23:43.915 --> 03:23:45.648

MATT: That'd be that one there?
TALIESIN: Yeah,

03:24:11.626 --> 03:24:12.490
on the one that's looking rough.

03:24:12.490 --> 03:24:15.140
MATT: That one burns away,

the body turning to black ash

03:24:16.743 --> 03:24:18.358

03:24:18.358 --> 03:24:19.905
into the little bit of air

03:24:19.905 --> 03:24:21.560
dissipating into the floor below.
LAURA: Into the rave.

03:24:21.560 --> 03:24:22.881
TALIESIN: We don't need to be close, by the way.

03:24:22.881 --> 03:24:25.444

SAM: Oh, I mean, you attacked already,

03:24:34.678 --> 03:24:36.438
right?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:24:36.438 --> 03:24:38.927
SAM: We're trying to stay rangy, right?

03:24:38.927 --> 03:24:40.508
TALIESIN: I've got 60 feet of range with this.

03:24:40.508 --> 03:24:44.849

03:24:44.849 --> 03:24:46.769

03:24:46.769 --> 03:24:49.129
TALIESIN: Yeah, we can stay 50 feet away.

03:24:49.129 --> 03:24:49.962
SAM: Okay, great.

03:24:49.962 --> 03:24:50.937
TALIESIN: I did say that, I was like: You can,

SAM: (squawks)

03:24:54.558 --> 03:24:59.058
MATT: I'll say it moves up at an angle to get within range

03:25:00.647 --> 03:25:03.794
of Caleb on the back of the eagle.

03:25:03.794 --> 03:25:04.810
As it is a large creature,

03:25:04.810 --> 03:25:07.887
it fits out 10 feet from the side, with a five-foot range.

03:25:07.887 --> 03:25:11.078
So it gets one swing at you on the back.

03:25:11.078 --> 03:25:12.060
LIAM: Okay.

03:25:13.727 --> 03:25:15.807

TALIESIN: Hard to hit when you're hanging from an eagle.

03:25:21.098 --> 03:25:22.038
MATT: Indeed.

03:25:22.038 --> 03:25:24.066
So that finishes its turn.

03:25:24.066 --> 03:25:25.048
Back to the top of the round.

03:25:25.048 --> 03:25:28.263
Really, at this point, who wants to go next?

03:25:28.263 --> 03:25:30.159
TALIESIN: Hard to dodge when you're swinging from a snake.

TRAVIS: I'll send Eldritch Blasts its way.

LAURA: I'm starting to feel bad for this ooze, you know?

03:25:53.851 --> 03:25:55.984
It was just chilling.
LIAM: Take him to the tower.

03:25:55.984 --> 03:25:58.072
MARISHA: He was living his best life.

03:25:58.072 --> 03:25:59.624
TRAVIS: 31 points

03:25:59.624 --> 03:26:00.457
of force damage.
MARISHA: He just wanted to be a part

03:26:00.457 --> 03:26:02.024
of an Irish B&amp;B.

03:26:02.024 --> 03:26:03.376
MATT: You hit it with one, and as it does,

03:26:03.376 --> 03:26:05.254
it impacts the actual ice and stone,

03:26:05.254 --> 03:26:06.858
and it starts falling off the wall.

03:26:06.858 --> 03:26:07.977
LAURA: (gasps)

03:26:07.977 --> 03:26:09.616
MATT: The two others impact,

03:26:09.616 --> 03:26:11.925
and you watch it just (squishing),

03:26:11.925 --> 03:26:14.605
and just explode out, as it smatters and sprays

03:26:14.605 --> 03:26:17.144
on the nearby walls, leaving this black trail

03:26:17.144 --> 03:26:20.317
that hisses as burns down the stone.

03:26:20.317 --> 03:26:23.500
And with that, combat comes to an end.

03:26:23.500 --> 03:26:25.838
LAURA: I do a barrel roll down to the bottom.

03:26:25.838 --> 03:26:27.025
MATT: Awesome.
MARISHA: Do a barrel roll.

03:26:27.025 --> 03:26:29.846
LIAM: Do a barrel roll.
TRAVIS: Oh, that's with m-- ah!

03:26:29.846 --> 03:26:32.088
MATT: Yeah, you are brought along for that, Fjord.

03:26:32.088 --> 03:26:33.033
TRAVIS: Ah!

03:26:33.033 --> 03:26:33.907
MATT: Feeling good about that

03:26:33.907 --> 03:26:35.859
as you scream all the way to the bottom.

03:26:35.859 --> 03:26:38.406
TRAVIS: (growing fainter) We had an understanding!

03:26:38.406 --> 03:26:39.516
MATT: Okay.

03:26:39.516 --> 03:26:40.685
LAURA: We did it.
TALIESIN: Your vomit would freeze

03:26:40.685 --> 03:26:41.614
by the time it gets down.

03:26:41.614 --> 03:26:43.316
It'll come down like powdered rain.

03:26:43.316 --> 03:26:44.149
TRAVIS: (groans)
LAURA: We did it.

03:26:44.149 --> 03:26:45.085
TALIESIN: Brown powdered rain.

03:26:45.085 --> 03:26:45.918
TRAVIS: Dry oatmeal.

03:26:45.918 --> 03:26:48.085
LAURA: We should definitely rest.

03:26:48.085 --> 03:26:49.577
TRAVIS: Yes, we should.

03:26:49.577 --> 03:26:50.803
ASHLEY: (squawk)

03:26:50.803 --> 03:26:52.136
LAURA: (squawk)
TRAVIS: Let's make sure there are no

03:26:52.136 --> 03:26:53.577
other tricks on this floor.

03:26:53.577 --> 03:26:55.805
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Or entrances or exits,

03:26:55.805 --> 03:26:57.940
though, just in case.
SAM: I'm going to drop Caduceus,

03:26:57.940 --> 03:27:00.605
and then use my eagle eye vision.

03:27:00.605 --> 03:27:02.033
Can I see in the dark? I have no idea.

03:27:02.033 --> 03:27:02.949
TALIESIN: Well, it's not dark,

03:27:02.949 --> 03:27:04.024
because I've got a light up.
SAM: Oh, that's right.

03:27:04.024 --> 03:27:05.456
LIAM: And there's daylight in here.

03:27:05.456 --> 03:27:06.864
TALIESIN: Take a look around.
SAM: I'm going to look

03:27:06.864 --> 03:27:09.243
around the bottom.
MARISHA: And still a rainbow LED.

03:27:09.243 --> 03:27:12.523
SAM: I'm looking specifically for a dagger.

03:27:12.523 --> 03:27:14.776
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check on that.

03:27:14.776 --> 03:27:16.537
LAURA: I'm clawing at that ice chunk

03:27:16.537 --> 03:27:18.254
to see if there's anything underneath it.

03:27:18.254 --> 03:27:19.087
SAM: I need it.
MATT: Okay.

03:27:19.087 --> 03:27:20.648
LAURA: I'm in eagle form still.
MATT: Okay.

03:27:20.648 --> 03:27:21.556
TALIESIN: I'm taking a look around

03:27:21.556 --> 03:27:24.274
with my natural, "Huh."

03:27:24.274 --> 03:27:25.673
Huh.
TRAVIS: Huh.

03:27:25.673 --> 03:27:28.119
MATT: Okay, looking for anything specific?

03:27:28.119 --> 03:27:30.154
TALIESIN: Something odd, out of place.

03:27:30.154 --> 03:27:30.987
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:27:30.987 --> 03:27:33.634
MARISHA: My natural "huh."
TALIESIN: My natural "huh."

03:27:33.634 --> 03:27:34.659
MATT: 19?
SAM: 19.

03:27:34.659 --> 03:27:37.119
MATT: As you peek around,

03:27:37.119 --> 03:27:39.319
it takes you about two minutes or so,

03:27:39.319 --> 03:27:42.050
but you do find the dagger that you threw.

03:27:42.050 --> 03:27:43.428
As it slid down, it (tinging)

03:27:43.428 --> 03:27:44.388
off the wall--
MARISHA: A two and a one?

03:27:44.388 --> 03:27:45.259
MATT: -- and got itself wedged

03:27:45.259 --> 03:27:46.348
between two stones.
MARISHA: Oh.

03:27:46.348 --> 03:27:47.219
MATT: But you do find it, thankfully,

03:27:47.219 --> 03:27:48.660
because the light gleams off the metal

03:27:48.660 --> 03:27:51.539
from certain angles, and you-- that's the one.

03:27:51.539 --> 03:27:52.608
TALIESIN: 21.

03:27:52.608 --> 03:27:53.810
MATT: 21?
TALIESIN: Mm.

03:27:53.810 --> 03:27:54.700
MATT: Okay.

03:27:54.700 --> 03:27:56.973
And you're clawing away at that one there?

03:27:56.973 --> 03:27:59.100
TALIESIN: I may find gold, don't know.

03:27:59.100 --> 03:28:01.769
MATT: So you're keeping an eye out, keeping an eye out.

03:28:01.769 --> 03:28:03.620
LAURA: (scratching)

03:28:03.620 --> 03:28:07.490
MATT: You carve away at the ice right there.

03:28:07.490 --> 03:28:09.930
Once it begins to break away,

03:28:09.930 --> 03:28:12.610
you uncover a small opening

03:28:12.610 --> 03:28:14.890
that was hidden behind it.
SAM: Yeah.

03:28:14.890 --> 03:28:18.708
MATT: You peer at it, and it's not completely encased,

03:28:18.708 --> 03:28:22.323
but it was blocked from view unless you went to the side,

03:28:22.323 --> 03:28:24.940
and as you break down that chunk of ice wall there,

03:28:24.940 --> 03:28:27.940
it exposes this one particular exit.

03:28:29.078 --> 03:28:31.108
MARISHA: Good work.
LIAM: You are an eagle for another 55 minutes.

03:28:31.108 --> 03:28:35.039
Is there anything that you've ever wanted to do?

03:28:35.039 --> 03:28:36.909
ASHLEY: (squawks)

03:28:36.909 --> 03:28:38.157
TRAVIS: That's it?
ASHLEY: (squawks)

03:28:38.157 --> 03:28:39.240

03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:40.999
(laughter)

03:28:40.999 --> 03:28:43.219
SAM: Scientists have allowed her to make one sound.

03:28:43.219 --> 03:28:45.986
(laughter)

03:28:45.986 --> 03:28:46.819
ASHLEY: Ah!

03:28:46.819 --> 03:28:49.794
(laughter)

03:28:49.794 --> 03:28:52.122
TRAVIS: That's a pretty good one, actually.

03:28:52.122 --> 03:28:53.770
TALIESIN: That was really good.

03:28:53.770 --> 03:28:56.020
(laughter)

03:28:57.660 --> 03:28:59.968
LAURA: I'm going to drop my eagle form.
SAM: Ah!

03:28:59.968 --> 03:29:02.212
MATT: Okay, so you drop your eagle form.

03:29:03.054 --> 03:29:05.016
All right, so we have one more eagle.

03:29:05.016 --> 03:29:08.118
The eagle will not fit through this opening, unfortunately.

03:29:08.118 --> 03:29:11.301
TALIESIN: I'll also say, I can burn a 10-minute spell,

03:29:11.301 --> 03:29:13.416
and give us a little bit of cushion,

03:29:13.416 --> 03:29:14.654
or we can take a short rest.

03:29:14.654 --> 03:29:16.129
TRAVIS: Short rest.

03:29:16.129 --> 03:29:17.387
LAURA: Yeah, let's rest here.

03:29:17.387 --> 03:29:18.494

03:29:18.494 --> 03:29:20.084

ASHLEY: (flapping)

03:29:20.985 --> 03:29:22.816
LIAM: Look at the little lines of black lightning,

03:29:22.816 --> 03:29:23.997
along the inside of the wings.

03:29:23.997 --> 03:29:25.174
LAURA: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Oh, that's very clever.

03:29:25.174 --> 03:29:26.496
LIAM: That was not an accident.

03:29:26.496 --> 03:29:29.936
ASHLEY: I do a shiver so I get really floofy.

03:29:29.936 --> 03:29:30.884
You know how they get like (poof)?

03:29:30.884 --> 03:29:32.072

03:32:16.830 --> 03:32:20.062
and heavy furs, and their ruined armor

03:32:20.062 --> 03:32:22.334

03:32:29.973 --> 03:32:34.973
SAM: Well, Fjord, I forgive you for dropping the rope,

03:32:35.622 --> 03:32:37.982
and sending me to my doom.

03:32:37.982 --> 03:32:41.061
TRAVIS: That was my fault, I apologize.

03:32:41.061 --> 03:32:43.654
I thought you would just do your nimble stuff,

03:32:43.654 --> 03:32:46.163
and it would be no big deal.

03:32:46.163 --> 03:32:47.262
SAM: You had faith in me.

03:32:47.262 --> 03:32:48.095
TRAVIS: I did.

03:32:49.294 --> 03:32:50.342
SAM: That's flattering.

03:32:50.342 --> 03:32:53.341
TRAVIS: I didn't mean to put Caduceus' life ahead of yours.

03:32:53.341 --> 03:32:56.258
SAM: No, no, that was a wise decision.

03:32:57.637 --> 03:33:01.453
TALIESIN: I appreciate the faith that you have in her.

03:33:01.453 --> 03:33:04.832
I mean, misplaced faith in this particular situation--

03:33:04.832 --> 03:33:07.949
(laughter)
TALIESIN: -- but very healthy.

03:33:09.307 --> 03:33:10.315
Very healthy.
SAM: I mean,

03:33:10.315 --> 03:33:11.341
there was nothing I could do.

03:33:11.341 --> 03:33:14.600
As soon as I landed, they were on top of me.

03:33:14.600 --> 03:33:16.363
I was--

03:33:16.363 --> 03:33:17.869
TRAVIS: Just minding your own?

03:33:17.869 --> 03:33:19.378
SAM: I just was minding my own business.

03:33:19.378 --> 03:33:21.512
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: They jumped me.

03:33:21.512 --> 03:33:22.752
TALIESIN: Insight check.

03:33:22.752 --> 03:33:25.038
SAM: (laughs)

03:33:28.419 --> 03:33:29.452
TALIESIN: 14.

03:33:30.609 --> 03:33:31.442
SAM: What do I do?

03:33:31.442 --> 03:33:32.788
TALIESIN: You can roll against it, if you like?

03:33:32.788 --> 03:33:34.071
MATT: Make a deception check, yeah.
SAM: Sure.

03:33:34.071 --> 03:33:35.447
TALIESIN: Deception.

03:33:35.447 --> 03:33:38.055
SAM: Ooh, eight.

03:33:39.555 --> 03:33:40.447
TALIESIN: Right.

03:33:40.447 --> 03:33:41.630
(laughter)

03:33:41.630 --> 03:33:43.888
MATT: Remember, you can't roll lower than a 10,

03:33:43.888 --> 03:33:44.721
but you don't have proficiency at it.

03:33:44.721 --> 03:33:46.297
SAM: Deception, I can.
MATT: That's right.

03:33:46.297 --> 03:33:48.199
Yes, you can.
(laughter)

03:33:48.199 --> 03:33:49.201
Because you are not proficient with that.

03:33:49.201 --> 03:33:50.737
TALIESIN: All right, all right.

03:33:50.737 --> 03:33:51.879
LIAM: I doused the driftglobe,

03:33:51.879 --> 03:33:53.376
but all this conversation is happening

03:33:53.376 --> 03:33:55.062
in the light of the celebone stick.

03:33:55.062 --> 03:33:55.895
TALIESIN: No, I've got Light up.

03:33:55.895 --> 03:33:56.945
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, it is.

03:33:56.945 --> 03:33:58.017
LAURA: And a fire.
TALIESIN: Oh, that too, yeah.

03:33:58.017 --> 03:33:59.226
TRAVIS: And the sword, and everything.

03:33:59.226 --> 03:34:00.657
ASHLEY: (beatboxing)

03:34:00.657 --> 03:34:02.687
LIAM: The pulse is still going.
MARISHA: How does the celebone

03:34:02.687 --> 03:34:03.912
stick work, again?
LAURA: I'm just going to rave dance

03:34:03.912 --> 03:34:05.485
for my break.
TRAVIS: Boots and pants, and boots and pants.

03:34:05.485 --> 03:34:06.318
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to--

03:34:06.318 --> 03:34:07.895
ASHLEY: (beatboxing)
MARISHA: -- just, you know,

03:34:07.895 --> 03:34:09.544
do a little twirly with the stick

03:34:09.544 --> 03:34:10.605
in my hand, you know?
TRAVIS: Oh, slow it down.

03:34:10.605 --> 03:34:11.880
MATT: Sure, yeah, go for it.
LAURA: Nice, nice.

03:34:11.880 --> 03:34:13.156
MARISHA: How long does it last?

03:34:13.156 --> 03:34:14.545
Can I reuse the stick?

03:34:14.545 --> 03:34:16.001
Is it, like, battery operated?

03:34:16.001 --> 03:34:17.588
Can I charge it at the end of the night?

03:34:17.588 --> 03:34:18.663
LIAM: AA batteries.
MATT: I will answer all those

03:34:18.663 --> 03:34:20.103
questions right now.
TALIESIN: USB 3.

03:34:20.103 --> 03:34:21.525
MATT: The effect lasts until deactivated,

03:34:21.525 --> 03:34:23.205
or one hour has passed.

03:34:23.205 --> 03:34:25.024
MARISHA: Oh, I'll deactivate it, and save it.

03:34:25.024 --> 03:34:26.823
MATT: Well, it can't be used
again until after the next dawn.

03:34:26.823 --> 03:34:27.903
MARISHA: Aww.

03:34:27.903 --> 03:34:29.316
LAURA: But you can use it tomorrow.
MARISHA: Oh.

03:34:29.316 --> 03:34:30.149
MATT: Yes.

03:34:30.149 --> 03:34:32.215
LAURA: Don't worry, Beau, I've got, like,

03:34:32.215 --> 03:34:35.556
10 celebone sticks!
MARISHA: Hell yeah!

03:34:35.556 --> 03:34:36.433
I'll put it away.
LAURA: I hold them between

03:34:36.433 --> 03:34:38.433
my fingers like Wolverine.

03:34:38.433 --> 03:34:41.830
MARISHA: Save my battery for my rave stick.

03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:43.412
MATT: Okay, you got it.

03:34:43.412 --> 03:34:44.265
TALIESIN: Oh, it's over.

03:34:44.265 --> 03:34:45.131
MATT: All right.

03:34:45.131 --> 03:34:45.964
TRAVIS: Shall we?

03:34:45.964 --> 03:34:46.955
SAM: Yes, please.

03:34:47.838 --> 03:34:48.930
LIAM: Please.

03:34:48.930 --> 03:34:52.360
MATT: All right, so you've taken your short rest.

03:34:52.360 --> 03:34:55.206
The small, low-hanging entrance

03:34:55.206 --> 03:34:58.078
to this next hallway, it looks like, is before you.

03:34:58.078 --> 03:34:59.366
What's the order you are traveling?

03:34:59.366 --> 03:35:00.758
LAURA: Oh god.
TRAVIS: We take turns.

03:35:00.758 --> 03:35:02.427
Beau, you're up, go for it.

03:35:02.427 --> 03:35:03.986
MARISHA: What? Okay.

03:35:04.906 --> 03:35:06.638
LAURA: Beau can't see in the dark.

03:35:06.638 --> 03:35:09.639
MARISHA: I take Veth, and I shove Veth forward.

03:35:09.639 --> 03:35:11.169
With my goggles.

03:35:11.169 --> 03:35:12.894
I still want those back.
SAM: Do you want them back?

03:35:12.894 --> 03:35:13.935
MARISHA: I do want those back.

03:35:13.935 --> 03:35:16.667
SAM: Right now, or like--
MARISHA: No, you should-- you scout.

03:35:16.667 --> 03:35:18.358
SAM: Scouting! Looking for traps!

03:35:18.358 --> 03:35:19.191
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:35:20.105 --> 03:35:21.147
SAM: Searching ahead.

03:35:21.147 --> 03:35:24.078
TRAVIS: Should we put a rope around Veth?

03:35:24.078 --> 03:35:25.231
MARISHA: She's fine.

03:35:25.231 --> 03:35:26.296
SAM: Ah, I'm fine.

03:35:26.296 --> 03:35:27.824
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Or a bell.

03:35:27.824 --> 03:35:29.416
MATT: Are you stealthing your way in?

03:35:29.416 --> 03:35:30.838
MARISHA: One of those kid leashes.
SAM: Sure, I'll stealth in.

03:35:30.838 --> 03:35:32.806
MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

03:35:32.806 --> 03:35:34.958
MARISHA: Little bear backpack.
SAM: Tons, a million,

03:35:34.958 --> 03:35:35.947
30-something.

03:35:35.947 --> 03:35:39.596
MATT: Okay, jesus, fucking rogues.

03:35:39.596 --> 03:35:40.732
All right, so--

03:35:40.732 --> 03:35:41.565
LIAM: I think I'll do a rogue again

03:35:41.565 --> 03:35:43.448
next campaign.
MATT: Pushing through the small opening,

03:35:43.448 --> 03:35:45.652
you find a partial hallway

03:35:45.652 --> 03:35:50.403
that is also interrupted by the previous collapse.

03:35:50.403 --> 03:35:52.005
You are entering from the side of it;

03:35:52.005 --> 03:35:53.772
this is not part of the initial structure.

03:35:53.772 --> 03:35:57.921
This pit that unveiled through some sort of an impact,

03:35:57.921 --> 03:36:01.321
upon its collision with this part of the city,

03:36:01.321 --> 03:36:03.001
this Aeor ruin.

03:36:03.001 --> 03:36:04.423
You enter a hallway into the right.

03:36:04.423 --> 03:36:06.321
It is mostly fallen in

03:36:06.321 --> 03:36:08.812
about 15 or 20 feet down to the right side.

03:36:08.812 --> 03:36:11.311
The left continues on.

03:36:11.311 --> 03:36:14.721
It is not lit, but you have your goggles on.

03:36:14.721 --> 03:36:16.214
SAM: Uh-huh, <i>my</i> goggles.

03:36:16.214 --> 03:36:17.801
MATT: So you continue down that path,

03:36:17.801 --> 03:36:19.950
keeping, carefully as you can,

03:36:19.950 --> 03:36:21.420
and you see the faint orange glow

03:36:21.420 --> 03:36:25.711
as two, it looks like, light-emitting orbs

03:36:25.711 --> 03:36:27.612
are affixed to two sides of the wall.

03:36:27.612 --> 03:36:30.372
SAM: I will scan around for some traps

03:36:30.372 --> 03:36:32.652
and tripwires, and look at those for...

03:36:32.652 --> 03:36:35.881
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:36:35.881 --> 03:36:36.858
SAM: 23.

03:36:36.858 --> 03:36:37.833
MATT: 23.

03:36:38.876 --> 03:36:42.921
You look around, nothing trap-related catches your eye.

03:36:42.921 --> 03:36:45.523
SAM: Nothing trap-related.

03:36:45.523 --> 03:36:46.805
Oh boy. (sighs)

03:36:46.805 --> 03:36:48.217
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's loaded.

03:36:48.217 --> 03:36:49.740
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:36:49.740 --> 03:36:50.907
SAM: I'll run by.

03:36:52.191 --> 03:36:53.788
MATT: As you run passed the middle

03:36:53.788 --> 03:36:57.329
of these two orange spheres that are glowing,

03:36:57.329 --> 03:36:58.209
nothing happens.

03:36:58.209 --> 03:37:01.035
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's the shit, right there!

03:37:01.035 --> 03:37:02.458
TALIESIN: It's going to wait to hit me.

03:37:02.458 --> 03:37:03.962
(laughter)

03:37:03.962 --> 03:37:06.029
TRAVIS: Caduceus, you feel...
TALIESIN: Nothing.

03:37:06.029 --> 03:37:08.431
LIAM: She's too short.
MARISHA: Why?

03:37:08.431 --> 03:37:09.264
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:37:11.249 --> 03:37:13.558
MATT: You see another set about 20 feet ahead of you,

03:37:13.558 --> 03:37:15.889
and you vaguely see in the distance, another set.

03:37:15.889 --> 03:37:19.812
Like these are occasional marks of lighting

03:37:19.812 --> 03:37:21.633
throughout this lengthened hallway.

03:37:21.633 --> 03:37:22.700
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:37:22.700 --> 03:37:24.877
LIAM: I'm going to talk into a wire and just say:

03:37:24.877 --> 03:37:26.751
All good, are we all good?

03:37:26.751 --> 03:37:29.109
SAM: So far so good, yes. Please, come, follow.

03:37:29.109 --> 03:37:31.228
LIAM: Yeah?
SAM: Save my life.

03:37:31.228 --> 03:37:32.811
LIAM: I slip into the hole.

03:37:32.811 --> 03:37:34.699
She wants us to come.

03:37:34.699 --> 03:37:35.779
MARISHA: All right.

03:37:35.779 --> 03:37:37.200
MATT: Who's after Caleb?

03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:38.033
ASHLEY: I'll go after Caleb.
MARISHA: I'll go.

03:37:38.033 --> 03:37:39.349
MATT: You move two at a time in this chamber.

03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:40.942
It's wide enough for two folks, so...

03:37:40.942 --> 03:37:42.529
MARISHA: Okay, good.

03:37:42.529 --> 03:37:43.541
SAM: ♪ Two by two! ♪

03:37:43.541 --> 03:37:46.319
MATT: Beau and Caleb, followed by?

03:37:46.319 --> 03:37:48.027
TALIESIN: We'll go.
MARISHA: ♪ Orlando! ♪

03:37:48.027 --> 03:37:49.263
MATT: All right, Yasha and Caduceus,

03:37:49.263 --> 03:37:51.607
and then Fjord, and Jester in the rear.

03:37:51.607 --> 03:37:52.440
Okay, cool.
TRAVIS: (slapping)

03:37:52.440 --> 03:37:53.595
TALIESIN: Break up the clerics.

03:37:53.595 --> 03:37:55.359
TRAVIS: High five me.

03:37:55.359 --> 03:37:56.343
(laughter)

03:37:56.343 --> 03:37:57.285
TRAVIS: Fuck.
LAURA: Sorry, I was--

03:37:57.285 --> 03:37:59.454
MATT: (claps) There you go.
LAURA: I was worried about

03:37:59.454 --> 03:38:01.829
those orbs, Fjord, I'm sorry.

03:38:03.023 --> 03:38:04.091
MATT: Continuing on--

03:38:04.091 --> 03:38:06.812
(laughter)

03:38:06.812 --> 03:38:10.224
- for about 150 or so feet,

03:38:10.224 --> 03:38:13.549
the hall is just one long, straight shot.

03:38:14.732 --> 03:38:17.030
The sides of it are fairly simple.

03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:18.712
You see a little bit of inset stone

03:38:18.712 --> 03:38:20.267
in rectangular shapes,

03:38:20.267 --> 03:38:24.914
but it lack the detail and beautiful artistic scrolling

03:38:24.914 --> 03:38:27.307
that the first chambers you entered had.

03:38:27.307 --> 03:38:30.539
This is more of a utility hallway.

03:38:30.539 --> 03:38:33.213
It's about that point that you see

03:38:33.213 --> 03:38:35.646
something on the ground ahead.

03:38:35.646 --> 03:38:39.899
It's beyond one of the orange globe positions,

03:38:39.899 --> 03:38:41.252
so you don't get much light

03:38:41.252 --> 03:38:46.103
other then the faint backlight of the next set beyond it.

03:38:46.103 --> 03:38:51.103
It looks like something piled in the middle of the chamber.

03:38:51.328 --> 03:38:54.793
SAM: Look, up on the ground ahead.

03:38:54.793 --> 03:38:57.043
(laughter)

03:38:57.993 --> 03:39:02.077
I'll cast Mage Hand and poke it.

03:39:03.605 --> 03:39:06.629
MATT: It moves slightly with
the impact of the Mage Hand, but--

03:39:06.629 --> 03:39:09.854
SAM: Like, pull-- is it cloth? What is it?

03:39:09.854 --> 03:39:12.121
MATT: You tug at one point and you see something move,

03:39:12.121 --> 03:39:13.193
like an arm.

03:39:13.193 --> 03:39:14.553
LAURA: (sighs) It's a body.

03:39:14.553 --> 03:39:16.636
MARISHA: A pile of bodies, okay.

03:39:17.503 --> 03:39:19.143
MATT: When it does hit, it has a wet sound.

03:39:19.143 --> 03:39:20.912
(wet thud)
SAM: Ooh, fresh.

03:39:20.912 --> 03:39:22.692
TRAVIS: How far away are we?

03:39:22.692 --> 03:39:24.114
MATT: From where you are right now?

03:39:24.114 --> 03:39:25.924
I'd say, roughly, 50 or so feet.

03:39:25.924 --> 03:39:28.813
TRAVIS: I'll use Divine Sense, just in case.

03:39:28.813 --> 03:39:29.775
MATT: Okay.

03:39:29.775 --> 03:39:32.364
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep an eye behind us for a second.

03:39:32.364 --> 03:39:33.197
MATT: Okay.

03:39:34.044 --> 03:39:36.996
TRAVIS: Any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet?

03:39:36.996 --> 03:39:37.829
MATT: No.

03:39:40.575 --> 03:39:43.375
Looking back, nothing seems to be following.

03:39:43.375 --> 03:39:45.145
TALIESIN: All right.

03:39:45.145 --> 03:39:46.324
SAM: All right, I'll scoot up to it,

03:39:46.324 --> 03:39:49.082
and see if it's a trap.
MATT: As you get closer--

03:39:49.082 --> 03:39:50.935
SAM: Oh, boy.
MATT: You can now see

03:39:50.935 --> 03:39:51.945
with the faint bit of light,

03:39:51.945 --> 03:39:55.836
the walls surrounding this odd pile in the middle

03:39:55.836 --> 03:39:58.770
are smeared with blood.

03:40:00.454 --> 03:40:03.103
Liquid blood, not frozen.

03:40:03.103 --> 03:40:06.652
And the temperature in here, itself, is a little warmer,

03:40:06.652 --> 03:40:08.552
but it's fresher.

03:40:10.292 --> 03:40:13.663
And you get a glance at the pile here, and there are bodies,

03:40:13.663 --> 03:40:17.204
multiple bodies, lying in different positions,

03:40:17.204 --> 03:40:19.503
leaned against the wall and slumped over,

03:40:19.503 --> 03:40:21.724
some that are just face down on the ground,

03:40:21.724 --> 03:40:25.810
others looking upward, limbs just akimbo.

03:40:25.810 --> 03:40:27.477
SAM: Any sign of death?

03:40:28.513 --> 03:40:29.600
I mean, cause of death?

03:40:29.600 --> 03:40:31.428
MATT: Oh, you can go ahead and inspect,

03:40:31.428 --> 03:40:33.807
if you want to make a medicine check.
SAM: I would like to inspect.

03:40:34.974 --> 03:40:37.389
TRAVIS: Are his ears and mouth bleeding?

03:40:37.389 --> 03:40:38.869
SAM: Uh, 30.

03:40:38.869 --> 03:40:40.726
MATT: 30 medicine check?
SAM: Oh, medicine?

03:40:40.726 --> 03:40:42.771
No, no, god, no.

03:40:42.771 --> 03:40:45.379
Natural 20.
(laughter)

03:40:45.379 --> 03:40:47.203
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: Adding your wisdom save.

03:40:47.203 --> 03:40:48.491
SAM: One. (laughs)

03:40:48.491 --> 03:40:51.061
MATT: 21, yeah, that'll do.

03:40:51.061 --> 03:40:52.625
So you do notice, as you get close,

03:40:52.625 --> 03:40:56.779
these bodies are all wearing thick traveling attire

03:40:56.779 --> 03:40:58.792
for the weather, similar to what you have.

03:40:58.792 --> 03:41:01.792
Though you recognize the clothing as Dynasty

03:41:01.792 --> 03:41:03.691
in make and style.

03:41:03.691 --> 03:41:05.068
So this is Kryn in history.

03:41:05.068 --> 03:41:07.621
LAURA: The same group of the guy that was frozen up top.

03:41:07.621 --> 03:41:12.421
MATT: Two drow, a human, a goblin, and two orcs.

03:41:12.421 --> 03:41:13.710
LIAM: Oh, that's so...

03:41:13.710 --> 03:41:15.712
MARISHA: Wait, two drow.

03:41:15.712 --> 03:41:17.571
TRAVIS: A goblin, an orc.
MARISHA: A human, a goblin,

03:41:17.571 --> 03:41:18.811
and two orcs.

03:41:18.811 --> 03:41:19.831
MATT: Six bodies total.

03:41:19.831 --> 03:41:22.500
LIAM: Makes sense for a party from the Dynasty.

03:41:22.500 --> 03:41:24.408
MARISHA: Six bodies total,

03:41:24.408 --> 03:41:26.781
one more body if we count the guy upstairs.

03:41:26.781 --> 03:41:30.203
LAURA: Like, this lookout up top.
MARISHA: It's us.

03:41:30.203 --> 03:41:31.036
LAURA: What?

03:41:31.036 --> 03:41:33.133
MARISHA: Well, just, like, one, two, three, four...

03:41:33.133 --> 03:41:34.870
LIAM: There's nine of us.
SAM: There's nine of us, yeah.

03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:36.972
TRAVIS: It's the Sun Tree.
MATT: This is not The Sun Tree.

03:41:36.972 --> 03:41:39.342
MARISHA: No, no, no, I just, yeah.

03:41:39.342 --> 03:41:40.990
SAM: The goblin looks like me.

03:41:40.990 --> 03:41:42.421
(laughter)

03:41:42.421 --> 03:41:43.972
TRAVIS: That red thread's looking real hard

03:41:43.972 --> 03:41:47.068
to snag onto something. (laughs)

03:41:47.068 --> 03:41:48.789
MARISHA: It must be.

03:41:48.789 --> 03:41:50.258
MATT: You do notice, with that roll,

03:41:50.258 --> 03:41:53.474
the bodies are not that old.

03:41:54.986 --> 03:41:57.587
Maybe a week or less.

03:41:57.587 --> 03:41:59.476
SAM: Slashed, bludgeoned?

03:41:59.476 --> 03:42:02.287
MATT: A mix of stab and slash wounds.

03:42:02.287 --> 03:42:04.308
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

03:42:04.308 --> 03:42:07.458
LAURA: Would I be able to tell with a medicine check--?

03:42:07.458 --> 03:42:08.618
Oh no, you just rolled a medicine check.

03:42:08.618 --> 03:42:09.838
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:42:09.838 --> 03:42:12.365
TALIESIN: Blood to body ratio on the outside,

03:42:12.365 --> 03:42:14.032
does it seem like...

03:42:15.708 --> 03:42:17.728
How much blood is out

03:42:17.728 --> 03:42:20.988
versus how much would have been in these people?

03:42:20.988 --> 03:42:22.805
Like, is this the normal amount of blood?

03:42:22.805 --> 03:42:25.020
I mean, or does it seem--
MATT: It doesn't seem copious.

03:42:25.020 --> 03:42:26.325
This isn't a Nightmare on Elm Street scene.

03:42:26.325 --> 03:42:28.507
TALIESIN: Sure, but like,
is there less then there should be,

03:42:28.507 --> 03:42:29.557
I suppose?

03:42:32.459 --> 03:42:34.984
I feel like I might know that.
MATT: Make a medicine check.

03:42:36.319 --> 03:42:38.790
TRAVIS: It's the same day, so I can't do See Invisibility.

03:42:38.790 --> 03:42:42.215
TALIESIN: 28.
MATT: 28, it looks about standard.

03:42:42.215 --> 03:42:43.106
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:42:44.353 --> 03:42:47.281
Yeah, I'm keeping an eye out, by the way.

03:42:47.281 --> 03:42:50.041
This is freaking me out.
TRAVIS: These bodies are piled.

03:42:50.041 --> 03:42:53.119
Is there an end to chamber that's behind them, at all?

03:42:53.119 --> 03:42:55.131
MATT: The hallway continues.
TRAVIS: It just continues.

03:42:55.131 --> 03:42:57.370
LAURA: What's above the bodies?

03:42:57.370 --> 03:42:59.353
MATT: The top of the hall itself is no more

03:42:59.353 --> 03:43:02.651
than maybe four or five feet from Caduceus' head.

03:43:02.651 --> 03:43:05.792
A total of, you know, 11, 12,

03:43:05.792 --> 03:43:07.881
at its height, and it's just a long hallway.

03:43:07.881 --> 03:43:10.911
MARISHA: Do the bodies look deliberately piled?

03:43:10.911 --> 03:43:13.233
Or like something happened?

03:43:13.233 --> 03:43:15.001
MATT: Roll an investigation check?
LIAM: Yeah, is it a skirmish?

03:43:15.001 --> 03:43:17.359
I'll assist, because I want to know if it's a skirmish.

03:43:17.359 --> 03:43:18.553
MARISHA: You're going to assist?
LIAM: Or did they get Tetsuoed

03:43:18.553 --> 03:43:21.097
in the hallway?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:43:21.097 --> 03:43:22.342
TALIESIN: Or if they were just dropped there.

03:43:22.342 --> 03:43:23.492
MARISHA: All right.

03:43:24.375 --> 03:43:25.721
28.

03:43:25.721 --> 03:43:27.073
MATT: 28.

03:43:27.073 --> 03:43:28.439
This was a skirmish.

03:43:28.439 --> 03:43:31.462
The blood splatter, the positioning of the bodies.

03:43:31.462 --> 03:43:34.187
A fight happened in this hallway,

03:43:34.187 --> 03:43:36.681
and this group was butchered.

03:43:36.681 --> 03:43:38.211
Not necessarily like--

03:43:38.211 --> 03:43:41.452
Well-- hard to say they're butchered, they were killed,

03:43:41.452 --> 03:43:43.858
but it doesn't look like they

03:43:45.159 --> 03:43:46.371
were just completely annihilated.

03:43:46.371 --> 03:43:49.043
They had weapons ready, they were armed for combat.

03:43:49.043 --> 03:43:51.366
MARISHA: They were an adventuring party, yeah.
MATT: To some degree.

03:43:51.366 --> 03:43:52.663
You have no idea what their purpose was here,

03:43:52.663 --> 03:43:56.679
but they're all left here dead from this scuffle.

03:43:56.679 --> 03:43:58.519
TRAVIS: We're thinking Molly's working with the Dynasty

03:43:58.519 --> 03:43:59.610
in some way?

03:43:59.610 --> 03:44:01.673
LAURA: No, I think they ambushed a Dynasty group

03:44:01.673 --> 03:44:03.516
that was already--
LIAM: No, competing group.

03:44:03.516 --> 03:44:05.538
MARISHA: You mentioned--
TALIESIN: We should check the bodies.

03:44:05.538 --> 03:44:08.403
MARISHA: -- slash wounds and stab
wounds? Is that what you said?

03:44:08.403 --> 03:44:09.503
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:44:10.723 --> 03:44:11.556
MARISHA: Okay.

03:44:11.556 --> 03:44:13.141
LIAM: We all ready knew that the Dynasty was trying

03:44:13.141 --> 03:44:15.734
for the same thing that DeRogna was.

03:44:15.734 --> 03:44:17.403
TRAVIS: Picked clean like the other bodies have been,

03:44:17.403 --> 03:44:22.236
or because it seems like liquid blood, not as picked over?

03:44:23.280 --> 03:44:25.010
MATT: I'll say you go ahead and check through the bodies,

03:44:25.010 --> 03:44:28.043
and other than their weapons
that have been left at the side,

03:44:28.043 --> 03:44:30.010
and their ruined armor,

03:44:30.010 --> 03:44:32.920
most anything of worth has been picked clean.

03:44:32.920 --> 03:44:35.440
TALIESIN: I'm going to get them going,

03:44:35.440 --> 03:44:38.084
so I'm going to start the Decompose.

03:44:39.109 --> 03:44:41.449
Let them start rotting.

03:44:41.449 --> 03:44:43.269
MARISHA: Well, Caduceus--
MATT: Fungus begins to take ahold.

03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:44.630
TALIESIN: Hm?
MATT: Fungus begins to take hold

03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:46.070
rather rapidly.
TALIESIN: Yeah, take a little while.

03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:47.670
MARISHA: While Caduceus is doing that,

03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:51.228
I'm just going to talk at him over his shoulder.

03:44:52.595 --> 03:44:55.274
Do you have anything that might help

03:44:55.274 --> 03:44:59.249
against mental or psychic dam-- damage?

03:44:59.249 --> 03:45:01.458
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.
MARISHA: (burp) Sorry.

03:45:01.458 --> 03:45:04.439
Sorry, it's really cold.
LAURA: The smell, it's the smell.

03:45:04.439 --> 03:45:06.356
MARISHA: It's just real gross.

03:45:07.679 --> 03:45:08.929
TALIESIN: I don't know.

03:45:11.187 --> 03:45:13.270
Not today, I don't think.

03:45:14.385 --> 03:45:17.947
Other than-- I can do it for a minute at a time,

03:45:17.947 --> 03:45:20.376
but I can't do anything else.

03:45:20.376 --> 03:45:21.597
MARISHA: A minute at a time?

03:45:21.597 --> 03:45:25.397
TALIESIN: A minute at a time, I can give you a little pep.

03:45:25.397 --> 03:45:26.664
Just a little, not a lot.

03:45:26.664 --> 03:45:29.555
I don't have anything that's great, not right now.

03:45:31.147 --> 03:45:32.728
Tomorrow.

03:45:32.728 --> 03:45:33.768
MARISHA: Tomorrow.

03:45:33.768 --> 03:45:35.117
TRAVIS: And this hallway that extends,

03:45:35.117 --> 03:45:37.622
the same sort of dual beacons of light,

03:45:37.622 --> 03:45:39.416
just into the distance?
MATT: Yep.

03:45:39.416 --> 03:45:41.734
TRAVIS: How far-- Does it extend

03:45:41.734 --> 03:45:43.663
quite a distance until visual acuity gives out,

03:45:43.663 --> 03:45:46.013
or does it seem like--?
MATT: It's been that way for a while.

03:45:46.013 --> 03:45:47.752
It does look like...

03:45:49.894 --> 03:45:53.888
it has-- in the next four or five sets from where you are,

03:45:53.888 --> 03:45:55.595
it seems to stop.

03:45:55.595 --> 03:45:56.656
TRAVIS: The light does?

03:45:56.656 --> 03:45:57.756
Interesting.

03:45:57.756 --> 03:45:58.837
LIAM: Okay.

03:45:58.837 --> 03:46:00.457
LAURA: How did all these other guys get through

03:46:00.457 --> 03:46:03.258
without fighting those oozes? (laughs)

03:46:04.216 --> 03:46:05.549
TRAVIS: Good question.

03:46:06.627 --> 03:46:07.648
Should keep going.

03:46:07.648 --> 03:46:10.603
Also, didn't you have to chop through, like,

03:46:10.603 --> 03:46:11.744
a big thing of ice to get here?

03:46:11.744 --> 03:46:13.933
LAURA: They probably put the ice there.

03:46:13.933 --> 03:46:16.283
MATT: Well, the ice wasn't--
LIAM: It was obscuring it.

03:46:16.283 --> 03:46:17.253
MATT: It was obscuring it, it wasn't

03:46:17.253 --> 03:46:20.443
actually blocked.
LIAM: You just went to town on it.

03:46:20.443 --> 03:46:21.861
LAURA: Ah.

03:46:21.861 --> 03:46:24.253
TRAVIS: Plus, it looked like it had
been a week, so maybe it was formed--

03:46:24.253 --> 03:46:26.203
ASHLEY: Do any of the bodies that we've seen,

03:46:26.203 --> 03:46:29.523
any of them look even remotely familiar,

03:46:29.523 --> 03:46:31.131
or just random?

03:46:31.131 --> 03:46:33.821
MATT: Looking over them, no, not really.

03:46:33.821 --> 03:46:37.341
MARISHA: And are they all just
drow, or various Dynasty folk?

03:46:37.341 --> 03:46:38.973
LAURA: Two orcs, a goblin...

03:46:38.973 --> 03:46:39.832
MARISHA: Oh, right,

03:46:39.832 --> 03:46:41.421
we answered this question.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:46:41.421 --> 03:46:42.763
MARISHA: Yeah, we did.
TRAVIS: We should keep going.

03:46:42.763 --> 03:46:44.781
(laughter)
MARISHA: We should, yeah.

03:46:44.781 --> 03:46:47.600
TRAVIS: We're coming back around.
MARISHA: Getting in the loops, yep.

03:46:47.600 --> 03:46:48.433
LAURA: Let's go.

03:46:48.433 --> 03:46:50.430
LIAM: Our friend is waiting.

03:46:50.430 --> 03:46:52.358
TRAVIS: Veth, do you want to take point?

03:46:52.358 --> 03:46:53.580
SAM: Don't I?
TALIESIN: I do have a Locate Creature,

03:46:53.580 --> 03:46:55.348
when it comes time for it.

03:46:55.348 --> 03:46:57.246
LAURA: You do?
TALIESIN: I do, and I'll also say,

03:46:57.246 --> 03:47:01.876
did you-- just in case, do you have a Word of Recall?

03:47:01.876 --> 03:47:02.959
Just in case?

03:47:04.233 --> 03:47:08.044
LAURA: Let's see if I prepared that one today.

03:47:08.044 --> 03:47:09.544
I feel like I did.

03:47:10.905 --> 03:47:12.665
Looks like I didn't. (laughs)

03:47:12.665 --> 03:47:14.332
SAM: Oh, boy.
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

03:47:18.361 --> 03:47:19.910
SAM: Well...
TALIESIN: I have one of those, too.

03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:22.149
Okay, so that's the spell I'm not going to use,

03:47:22.149 --> 03:47:25.040
unless a bunch of people are already dead.

03:47:25.040 --> 03:47:26.761
MARISHA: Well, does anyone with magic have anything

03:47:26.761 --> 03:47:30.094
that can help us against psychic damage?

03:47:31.420 --> 03:47:33.253
TRAVIS: Nope.
TALIESIN: No.

03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:38.888
MARISHA: Just curious after encountering two corpses

03:47:38.888 --> 03:47:40.799
with blood coming out of their eyes,

03:47:40.799 --> 03:47:44.721
and horrible expressions on their faces.
TALIESIN: I have--

03:47:44.721 --> 03:47:47.133
LAURA: But these guys--
TALIESIN: -- Bless.

03:47:48.175 --> 03:47:49.366
TRAVIS: But these guys are tore up.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:47:49.366 --> 03:47:50.199
LAURA: Yeah.

03:47:51.928 --> 03:47:53.153
MARISHA: Because...

03:47:54.228 --> 03:47:55.603
M-moll--

03:47:55.603 --> 03:47:56.853
Lucien,

03:47:59.637 --> 03:48:04.521
we're assuming, killed Vess DeRogna by himself?

03:48:09.374 --> 03:48:10.207
LAURA: Yeah.

03:48:12.167 --> 03:48:13.350
SAM: But he also--

03:48:13.350 --> 03:48:14.816
LAURA: Oh, that's why.
SAM: I mean, if they are of the same order

03:48:14.816 --> 03:48:16.537
this Nine Eyes Order,

03:48:16.537 --> 03:48:19.735
maybe they know each other's weaknesses.

03:48:19.735 --> 03:48:22.287
TALIESIN: And the element of surprise.

03:48:22.287 --> 03:48:26.556
MARISHA: But we saw that drow at
the top of this excavation site

03:48:26.556 --> 03:48:29.016
that looked just like Vess,

03:48:29.016 --> 03:48:32.683
and he didn't have any eyes tattooed on him.

03:48:34.346 --> 03:48:37.996
If they died the same way, because Lucien can just--

03:48:37.996 --> 03:48:39.178
LAURA: Give them a vision,

03:48:39.178 --> 03:48:41.138
or overwhelm their brains.
MARISHA: Or do something.

03:48:41.138 --> 03:48:42.221
Right, right.

03:48:43.577 --> 03:48:45.261
How are we supposed to compete against that?

03:48:45.261 --> 03:48:49.165
He killed a member of the Cerberus Assembly by himself.

03:48:50.007 --> 03:48:52.506
LIAM: We are at a disadvantage.

03:48:52.506 --> 03:48:54.018
Nothing has changed.

03:48:54.018 --> 03:48:55.688
LAURA: I didn't prepare Word of Recall

03:48:55.688 --> 03:48:59.108
because Vess said that teleporting in these areas

03:48:59.108 --> 03:49:01.087
would be really, really dangerous,

03:49:01.087 --> 03:49:05.079
so I thought that would be a bad idea.

03:49:06.113 --> 03:49:08.166
TALIESIN: I got a thing I might be able to do.

03:49:08.166 --> 03:49:09.211
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

03:49:11.169 --> 03:49:13.879
TALIESIN: Fair point, we'll remember that for next time.

03:49:13.879 --> 03:49:16.989
Figured teleporting out is easier than teleporting in.

03:49:16.989 --> 03:49:19.519
TRAVIS: Let's go, let's go.

03:49:19.519 --> 03:49:22.183
MARISHA: Yeah, keep going.
TALIESIN: Next time, I got an idea.

03:49:22.183 --> 03:49:23.381
Just in case.
SAM: I'll take the point again,

03:49:23.381 --> 03:49:26.812
and keep going down the same hallway.

03:49:26.812 --> 03:49:28.154
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: If it comes to it.

03:49:29.183 --> 03:49:31.754
TRAVIS: Should we be checking the hallways for hidden doors,

03:49:31.754 --> 03:49:33.750
and just normal shit?

03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:34.675
SAM: Just run your sword

03:49:34.675 --> 03:49:35.547
along the sides as we go.
MARISHA: Just run your fingers

03:49:35.547 --> 03:49:36.886
along the wall.
TRAVIS: I'll take one side,

03:49:36.886 --> 03:49:38.040
you take the other.
MARISHA: All right, deal.

03:49:38.040 --> 03:49:39.494
TALIESIN: I'll keep my eyes open.

03:49:39.494 --> 03:49:40.327
MATT: Okay.

03:49:41.246 --> 03:49:43.605
Continuing on, running your hands
along both sides of the hall

03:49:43.605 --> 03:49:48.605
as you progress forward, eventually you pass the fifth,

03:49:48.772 --> 03:49:52.247
fourth, third, second,

03:49:53.274 --> 03:49:54.937
and final set of lights.

03:49:54.937 --> 03:49:56.396
And at that finale set of lights,

03:49:56.396 --> 03:49:58.363
the hall comes to an end.

03:49:59.909 --> 03:50:04.901
There before you, you see a single, rusted, iron door.

03:50:06.559 --> 03:50:08.059
It has no handles.

03:50:09.359 --> 03:50:10.959
It has no knobs.

03:50:12.280 --> 03:50:15.084
It has no break in the middle of it.

03:50:15.084 --> 03:50:17.874
It's just a solid iron slab

03:50:17.874 --> 03:50:20.658
of different material than the rest of the hallway,

03:50:20.658 --> 03:50:21.911
but it does have crossbars,

03:50:21.911 --> 03:50:24.639
and it seems to resemble a door in its construction,

03:50:24.639 --> 03:50:27.577
and it blocks your passage.

03:50:27.577 --> 03:50:30.883
What you do notice, is there is an empty shelf,

03:50:30.883 --> 03:50:33.179
not dissimilar to the pillars

03:50:33.179 --> 03:50:35.901
that you encountered in that previous chamber,

03:50:35.901 --> 03:50:38.883
though it is wider and further back.

03:50:38.883 --> 03:50:41.301
Looks like it's about six inches tall,

03:50:41.301 --> 03:50:43.134
and about a foot wide.

03:50:44.371 --> 03:50:45.821
Like, a little slot.

03:50:47.604 --> 03:50:49.025
LIAM: Are there--
MARISHA: In the door?

03:50:49.025 --> 03:50:50.855
MATT: In the door.

03:50:50.855 --> 03:50:52.648
LIAM: Is there any sort of etching or pattern

03:50:52.648 --> 03:50:55.224
in the way Beauregard encountered?

03:50:55.224 --> 03:50:57.428
MATT: You go ahead and glance inside.

03:50:57.428 --> 03:51:00.822
It looks like the entire interior is covered

03:51:00.822 --> 03:51:04.322
in etching and various types of arcane glyphs,

03:51:04.322 --> 03:51:07.372
sigils, and variation of Draconic,

03:51:07.372 --> 03:51:09.474
in the same sort of ancient script that you've seen

03:51:09.474 --> 03:51:13.254
in other elements of Aeorian reference.

03:51:13.254 --> 03:51:15.191
But as opposed to just seeing the one at the bottom,

03:51:15.191 --> 03:51:17.004
the entirety of the interior

03:51:17.004 --> 03:51:22.004
is just one massive network of arcane script.

03:51:22.303 --> 03:51:23.934
TALIESIN: Does the arcane script mean anything?

03:51:23.934 --> 03:51:25.185
Does it say anything?

03:51:25.185 --> 03:51:27.422
MATT: Make an arcana check.

03:51:27.422 --> 03:51:30.722
LAURA: Guidance because you're looking.

03:51:32.806 --> 03:51:37.556
LIAM: Also, I pull out one of my last two pearls,

03:51:37.556 --> 03:51:39.338
all that's left is the black one,

03:51:39.338 --> 03:51:41.637
and place it to my own head,

03:51:41.637 --> 03:51:45.232
and take a moment to cast a little dunamancy.

03:51:45.232 --> 03:51:46.104
MATT: All righty.

03:51:46.104 --> 03:51:47.271
LIAM: So Guidance.

03:51:53.486 --> 03:51:57.945
(sighs) Terrible, terrible.

03:51:57.945 --> 03:51:59.926
Guidance is a d4?

03:52:00.920 --> 03:52:02.122
20 total.

03:52:02.122 --> 03:52:04.772
MATT: 20 total.
SAM: Hey, not terrible.

03:52:04.772 --> 03:52:06.663
MATT: The essence of this seems to be

03:52:06.663 --> 03:52:09.818
some sort of an Abjuration-type nexus,

03:52:09.818 --> 03:52:13.201
some sort of an Abjuration-type nexus,

03:52:14.415 --> 03:52:18.655
but it is an incomplete glyph,

03:52:18.655 --> 03:52:21.284
and both the top and the bottom of it

03:52:21.284 --> 03:52:24.660
seem to direct towards the empty space

03:52:24.660 --> 03:52:26.530
in the middle of the shelf.

03:52:26.530 --> 03:52:28.652
Best you can ascertain,

03:52:28.652 --> 03:52:32.966
it requires something to complete the connection.

03:52:32.966 --> 03:52:34.204
it requires something to complete the connection.

03:52:34.204 --> 03:52:35.295
TRAVIS: (buzzing movement)

03:52:35.295 --> 03:52:36.844
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:52:36.844 --> 03:52:38.261
TRAVIS: Yeah, your arm.

03:52:39.928 --> 03:52:41.485
LAURA: But it's a rectangle shape?

03:52:41.485 --> 03:52:42.771
MATT: Yes, it's a little slot,

03:52:42.771 --> 03:52:44.764
about six inches tall and about a foot wide.

03:52:44.764 --> 03:52:47.512
LIAM: Is it a Gom Jabbar?

03:52:47.512 --> 03:52:50.286
MARISHA: Okay, wait, six inches...

03:52:50.286 --> 03:52:52.618
MATT: Six inches high, and about a foot wide.

03:52:52.618 --> 03:52:54.595
ASHLEY: In the middle of the...

03:52:54.595 --> 03:52:56.964
MATT: In the middle of the iron door.

03:52:56.964 --> 03:52:59.273
TRAVIS: No blood, dried blood on the ground,

03:52:59.273 --> 03:53:01.881
on the door, anywhere?

03:53:01.881 --> 03:53:04.281
MATT: Glancing around here, make an investigation check.

03:53:07.253 --> 03:53:08.245
TRAVIS: 19.
MATT: 19.

03:53:08.245 --> 03:53:09.893
Looking around, inspecting the area,

03:53:09.893 --> 03:53:12.761
looking at the inside, checking the floor around.

03:53:12.761 --> 03:53:14.788
Doesn't appear to be any signs of dried blood.

03:53:15.679 --> 03:53:18.410
SAM: So it requires something to complete it,

03:53:18.410 --> 03:53:20.843
but we don't know if that's something like blood, or magic?

03:53:20.843 --> 03:53:23.544
but we don't know if that's something like blood, or magic?

03:53:23.544 --> 03:53:26.168
Like, it could be magic?
MARISHA: What's the root of the glyph?

03:53:26.168 --> 03:53:28.179
Do we understand the root of the glyph?

03:53:28.179 --> 03:53:29.029
LIAM: Catalyst.
LAURA: He was saying,

03:53:29.029 --> 03:53:30.812
like, Abjuration.
MATT: It's Abjuration,

03:53:30.812 --> 03:53:33.070
sort of.
LIAM: Protection, a ward, keeping us out.

03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:34.414
MARISHA: Protection.

03:53:36.723 --> 03:53:39.136
TRAVIS: Same low ceiling that we were in in the hallway,

03:53:39.136 --> 03:53:42.347
about four feet above Caduceus' head?

03:53:42.347 --> 03:53:43.700
Width of the hallway is still the same.

03:53:43.700 --> 03:53:44.884
It's just this door.
MATT: Correct, it's just been

03:53:44.884 --> 03:53:47.429
one continuous long, straight hallway.

03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:48.512
MARISHA: Protection.

03:53:50.929 --> 03:53:54.592
TALIESIN: Nothing's pinged your emergency wire, either?

03:53:54.592 --> 03:53:57.925
LIAM: I mean, yeah, it would have mentally dinged.

03:53:58.773 --> 03:54:00.955
TALIESIN: Bodies had all their arms, right?

03:54:02.130 --> 03:54:02.963
MATT: Yes.

03:54:04.903 --> 03:54:07.149
Or, at least, all their arms were present.

03:54:07.149 --> 03:54:10.514
LAURA: Is there dust on the ground, or anything like that?

03:54:10.514 --> 03:54:12.816
Can we see, like, footprints and stuff

03:54:12.816 --> 03:54:14.944
that isn't ours on the ground, at all?

03:54:15.977 --> 03:54:18.000
MATT: There isn't a whole lot of dust in this chamber

03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:21.000
because there isn't a lot of traffic anymore.

03:54:22.625 --> 03:54:24.840
It's hard to really tell, I'd say.

03:54:24.840 --> 03:54:26.709
LIAM: I want to go back for one of those bodies.

03:54:26.709 --> 03:54:27.542
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:54:29.336 --> 03:54:30.169
Oh.

03:54:31.589 --> 03:54:32.519
LAURA: What?

03:54:32.519 --> 03:54:34.703
TALIESIN: Darn, we, yeah...

03:54:34.703 --> 03:54:36.087
SAM: What?
LAURA: What, Caduceus?

03:54:36.087 --> 03:54:38.727
TALIESIN: We have an arm with a tattoo.

03:54:38.727 --> 03:54:40.247
SAM: We do?

03:54:40.247 --> 03:54:41.197
LAURA: (gasps)
SAM: We also have a head.

03:54:41.197 --> 03:54:42.574
LAURA: We have Vess DeRogna's body.

03:54:42.574 --> 03:54:43.482
LIAM: Well--

03:54:43.482 --> 03:54:47.006
TALIESIN: Let's try one of the normal ones first.
LIAM: Yeah, let's try something else first.

03:54:47.006 --> 03:54:48.338
SAM: We have a head that you chopped off.

03:54:48.338 --> 03:54:49.372
LIAM: I also thought of that,

03:54:49.372 --> 03:54:52.870
but I just didn't want to take time to--
LAURA: But Vess DeRogna's body has the tattoos on it.

03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:54.448
LIAM: -- take everything out and put everything back.

03:54:54.448 --> 03:54:56.443
So let's just grab a person.

03:54:56.443 --> 03:54:57.276
TALIESIN: I'll help you.

03:54:57.276 --> 03:54:58.592
LIAM: Thank you.
MATT: Okay.

03:54:58.592 --> 03:54:59.825
TALIESIN: We're going to go back for a body.

03:54:59.825 --> 03:55:02.124
MATT: Which of the corpses do you want?

03:55:02.124 --> 03:55:02.957
LIAM: It was?

03:55:04.305 --> 03:55:06.536
MATT: Two orcs, two drow, a goblin, and a human.

03:55:06.536 --> 03:55:07.456
LIAM: I'll grab a drow.

03:55:07.456 --> 03:55:08.416
MATT: Okay.

03:55:08.416 --> 03:55:10.706
TALIESIN: Any of them have tattoos on their arm?

03:55:10.706 --> 03:55:12.516
MATT: You take a glace over them.

03:55:12.516 --> 03:55:15.210
Nothing beyond ornamental elements.

03:55:15.210 --> 03:55:16.435
Nothing that seems to be in line

03:55:16.435 --> 03:55:17.562
with what you were referring to.

03:55:17.562 --> 03:55:18.964
TALIESIN: Well, all right.

03:55:18.964 --> 03:55:20.873
LIAM: But as we're walking back.

03:55:20.873 --> 03:55:24.522
This is good, it's due diligence, but I think you're right.

03:55:24.522 --> 03:55:26.385
So we'll bring the corpse there,

03:55:26.385 --> 03:55:29.395
and we'll experiment with a hand.

03:55:29.395 --> 03:55:31.869
MATT: Okay. You place the hand in there.

03:55:31.869 --> 03:55:33.219
No reaction.

03:55:33.219 --> 03:55:38.210
TRAVIS: Just as a note, Beau, I do have Heroism,

03:55:39.437 --> 03:55:41.079
which, if I cast at a 5th-level,

03:55:41.079 --> 03:55:44.278
it makes creatures immune to being frightened,

03:55:44.278 --> 03:55:45.810
and you gain temporary hit points

03:55:45.810 --> 03:55:48.333
equal to your spell casting mod.

03:55:48.333 --> 03:55:51.892
So it's like four people, five people.

03:55:52.876 --> 03:55:54.165
Not much, but...

03:55:54.165 --> 03:55:58.065
ASHLEY: Do you still have Molly's vial of blood?

03:56:02.554 --> 03:56:04.258
LAURA: Did we end up getting that?
TALIESIN: We should, actually.

03:56:04.258 --> 03:56:05.924
LAURA: Yeah, we do, we have Molly's blood.

03:56:05.924 --> 03:56:07.015
MATT: You do.

03:56:07.015 --> 03:56:09.928
All the vials are less then they were when you gave them,

03:56:09.928 --> 03:56:12.314
but you do have some.

03:56:12.314 --> 03:56:14.416
MARISHA: Is there any other markings around?

03:56:14.416 --> 03:56:17.186
So we have this glyph that's Abjuration.

03:56:17.186 --> 03:56:20.314
Anything else that's indicative around it?

03:56:20.314 --> 03:56:23.877
MATT: Nope, it's just looks like
an iron door surrounding it.

03:56:23.877 --> 03:56:26.953
TRAVIS: And you think it needs
to be something with Abjuration?

03:56:26.953 --> 03:56:30.393
Like, the symbols indicate Abjuration?

03:56:30.393 --> 03:56:31.866
LAURA: What if they have the symbol

03:56:31.866 --> 03:56:33.895
on their wrist, one of the Nine Eyes.
TRAVIS: Well, I have

03:56:33.895 --> 03:56:36.296
Armor of Agathys, which is ice.

03:56:36.296 --> 03:56:37.603
LIAM: I'm going to sit on the ground,

03:56:37.603 --> 03:56:39.905
and place my necklace on the ground,

03:56:39.905 --> 03:56:42.051
and I'm going to say: Una.

03:56:42.051 --> 03:56:43.475
Which makes it all (whooshing).

03:56:43.475 --> 03:56:45.272
MATT: Okay, all the contents (whooshing)

03:56:45.272 --> 03:56:47.866
fill the bottom of the middle of this hallway,

03:56:47.866 --> 03:56:49.057
including the body of DeRogna.

03:56:49.057 --> 03:56:51.015
LIAM: Yeah, DeRogna's here.

03:56:51.015 --> 03:56:53.354
I grab her underneath her armpits,

03:56:53.354 --> 03:56:54.821
and drag her over to this thing.

03:56:54.821 --> 03:56:56.506
TALIESIN: I help.
LIAM: And take her hand,

03:56:56.506 --> 03:56:58.397
and stick it in.

03:57:00.796 --> 03:57:01.654
MATT: No reaction.

03:57:01.654 --> 03:57:03.388
LAURA: (groans)

03:57:03.388 --> 03:57:04.773
LIAM: Hm.

03:57:04.773 --> 03:57:06.351
MARISHA: Wait, flip it around, though.

03:57:06.351 --> 03:57:08.533
Try it this way. That's where the tattoo is.

03:57:08.533 --> 03:57:09.581
MATT: It's front and back.

03:57:09.581 --> 03:57:11.056
MARISHA: Oh, never mind.

03:57:11.056 --> 03:57:11.965
LAURA: It's a card reader.

03:57:11.965 --> 03:57:12.834
MARISHA: I just didn't know, like,

03:57:12.834 --> 03:57:15.464
if you're checking a passport, you know?

03:57:15.464 --> 03:57:16.670
LIAM: How big is it?

03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:21.565
MATT: Six inches tall, a foot wide,
and about a foot in depth.

03:57:21.565 --> 03:57:23.256
SAM: Magic. Abjuration magic.

03:57:23.256 --> 03:57:25.823
MARISHA: Yeah, Abjuration, try it.
ASHLEY: Wait, Abjuration is what, again?

03:57:25.823 --> 03:57:27.251
TRAVIS: Like, protective stuff.

03:57:27.251 --> 03:57:28.395
ASHLEY: Protective stuff.

03:57:28.395 --> 03:57:30.155
TALIESIN: I think it means it is a protective spell,

03:57:30.155 --> 03:57:31.863
not that protective spells open it.

03:57:31.863 --> 03:57:33.764
MARISHA: But that burns your shit?

03:57:33.764 --> 03:57:35.373
TRAVIS: No, I mean, it's a 1st-level spell.

03:57:35.373 --> 03:57:36.681
I can try it.

03:57:37.599 --> 03:57:39.414
Let's be honest, I don't use a ton of those.

03:57:39.414 --> 03:57:40.905
Want me to try it?
SAM: Sure.

03:57:40.905 --> 03:57:42.971
TRAVIS: All right, I'll cast Armor of Agathys

03:57:42.971 --> 03:57:45.474
on myself at 1st-level.

03:57:45.474 --> 03:57:47.723
MATT: Okay, like, standing at the door?

03:57:47.723 --> 03:57:49.864
SAM: Well, do you have to direct it into the hole?

03:57:49.864 --> 03:57:52.223
LIAM: Probably got to put your hand in and dump.

03:57:52.223 --> 03:57:53.151
MARISHA: And then do it?
LIAM: I have Shield, too.

03:57:53.151 --> 03:57:55.764
I can do it at level one.

03:57:55.764 --> 03:57:56.597
LAURA: Or is it a self?

03:57:56.597 --> 03:57:59.222
TRAVIS: Surrounds me, manifesting as a spectral frost

03:57:59.222 --> 03:58:01.200
that covers me and my gear.

03:58:01.200 --> 03:58:02.347
MARISHA: Stick your hand in there while you do it.

03:58:02.347 --> 03:58:03.784
LIAM: I think you could just do it.

03:58:03.784 --> 03:58:04.771
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

03:58:04.771 --> 03:58:08.982
I put my hand in and cast Armor of Agathys at 1st-level.

03:58:08.982 --> 03:58:12.815
MATT: Okay, does it have somatic components on it?

03:58:14.878 --> 03:58:16.398
TRAVIS: A cup of water.

03:58:16.398 --> 03:58:18.777
MATT: What does it say under components, like, V&amp;S?

03:58:18.777 --> 03:58:20.339
TRAVIS: VSM.
MATT: Okay, great.

03:58:20.339 --> 03:58:21.305
So as you put your hand in there,

03:58:21.305 --> 03:58:23.765
and you do the manipulation of your fingers,

03:58:23.765 --> 03:58:26.060
the spell begins to apparate,

03:58:26.060 --> 03:58:28.680
but then the energy (whooshes)

03:58:28.680 --> 03:58:30.260
vanishes inside the slot,

03:58:30.260 --> 03:58:32.810
and you see a faint blue glow from the inside.

03:58:32.810 --> 03:58:34.172
MARISHA: (snapping)

03:58:34.172 --> 03:58:38.153
MATT: You glance, and you can see the intricate sigils.

03:58:38.153 --> 03:58:39.993
A portion of it is now glowing.

03:58:39.993 --> 03:58:42.985
About, maybe, a sixth of the full equation.

03:58:42.985 --> 03:58:45.649
LAURA: (gasps) You have to do a spell of every type.

03:58:45.649 --> 03:58:46.809
MARISHA: We have to do more.

03:58:46.809 --> 03:58:49.419
TALIESIN: What's another--
LIAM: Or it's all Abjuration.

03:58:50.969 --> 03:58:52.670
MARISHA: What about the dome?

03:58:52.670 --> 03:58:53.503
Maybe it's just--

03:58:53.503 --> 03:58:54.849
LAURA: I've got an Abjuration spell.

03:58:54.849 --> 03:58:56.590
Do you think it's all Abjuration?

03:58:56.590 --> 03:58:59.841
Do we see any other type of glyphs, or?

03:58:59.841 --> 03:59:02.737
MARISHA: You said that was one out of...

03:59:02.737 --> 03:59:04.030
LIAM: Six.
MARISHA: Did you say one out of six?

03:59:04.030 --> 03:59:06.129
MATT: A sixth of it is now glowing.

03:59:06.129 --> 03:59:07.929
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was only at 1st-level.

03:59:07.929 --> 03:59:09.179
MARISHA: Because it was only 1st-level.

03:59:09.179 --> 03:59:11.556
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: Like, maybe it's a level thing.

03:59:11.556 --> 03:59:14.100
TRAVIS: Unless we're making Captain Planet.

03:59:14.100 --> 03:59:16.455
LIAM: I will stick my hand in, and just as an experiment,

03:59:16.455 --> 03:59:17.923
dump Shield in, as well.

03:59:17.923 --> 03:59:20.535
That's level one, as well, to see if it adds or...

03:59:20.535 --> 03:59:21.666
MATT: As you go ahead and put your hand in there,

03:59:21.666 --> 03:59:22.653
and release the Shield,

03:59:22.653 --> 03:59:24.934
once again the Shield is about to apparate,

03:59:24.934 --> 03:59:26.764
and the magic (whoosh) shoots inside,

03:59:26.764 --> 03:59:29.026
and you glance inside, and another sixth of it,

03:59:29.026 --> 03:59:30.202
about a third of the interior

03:59:30.202 --> 03:59:31.760
is now glowing.
TRAVIS: Ooh, doggy!

03:59:31.760 --> 03:59:33.218
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Was that the same?

03:59:33.218 --> 03:59:34.284
Was that also--

03:59:34.284 --> 03:59:35.263
MARISHA: That was also Abjuration.

03:59:35.263 --> 03:59:40.034
LIAM: I have lots of Shield, so I will do another two.

03:59:40.034 --> 03:59:42.326
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: I will do that twice more.

03:59:42.326 --> 03:59:43.522
MATT: Two thirds of it are now glowing,

03:59:43.522 --> 03:59:45.952
with this same process repeating itself.

03:59:45.952 --> 03:59:48.367
LIAM: Now, just so that I do not empty out--
MARISHA: Yeah, Caduceus,

03:59:48.367 --> 03:59:49.417
do you have anything?

03:59:49.417 --> 03:59:51.234
TALIESIN: I don't even know how to figure out what I have.

03:59:51.234 --> 03:59:54.914
LAURA: I've got-- Protection from
Energy is-- but I've used up--

03:59:54.914 --> 03:59:56.903
MARISHA: Anything protective is good.
LAURA: I've only got one 3rd-level

03:59:56.903 --> 03:59:58.525
spell left, and if we need that for

03:59:58.525 --> 03:59:59.566
Revivify, I'm--
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a good one.

03:59:59.566 --> 04:00:01.965
TRAVIS: I have another first level spell.
LIAM: I can keep doing it,

04:00:01.965 --> 04:00:03.382
if we need me to.

04:00:04.256 --> 04:00:05.339
TALIESIN: Location...

04:00:06.244 --> 04:00:08.854
SAM: We're sure nothing else will work, right?

04:00:10.190 --> 04:00:11.023
LAURA: No.

04:00:11.023 --> 04:00:14.804
TRAVIS: I can do it. I have first level spells.

04:00:14.804 --> 04:00:16.628
LIAM: I never use my lower slots anymore.

04:00:16.628 --> 04:00:17.794
LAURA: Then yeah, use them.

04:00:17.794 --> 04:00:19.077
SAM: (mocking) Oh, wow.

04:00:19.077 --> 04:00:20.049
LAURA: Because ours are higher level.

04:00:20.049 --> 04:00:21.052
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I got a fourth level.

04:00:21.052 --> 04:00:23.802
LIAM: I'll dump Shield twice at second level.

04:00:23.802 --> 04:00:25.530
I'll fill it up.

04:00:25.530 --> 04:00:28.713
MATT: Okay, the first time you cast Shield at second level--

04:00:28.713 --> 04:00:29.546
LIAM: Yeah?

04:00:30.388 --> 04:00:31.622
MATT: It fills up the rest of it.

04:00:31.622 --> 04:00:33.622
LIAM: Oh, okay.
LAURA: Oh, good.

04:00:33.622 --> 04:00:35.182
MATT: Second level slot was what was required.

04:00:35.182 --> 04:00:36.630
LIAM: Ah.
LAURA: Oh.

04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:39.908
MATT: So now with all six spell slots sacrificed,

04:00:39.908 --> 04:00:44.379
it glows blue, and the door (rumbling)

04:00:44.379 --> 04:00:45.753
opens before you.

04:00:45.753 --> 04:00:46.820
TALIESIN: Should put that stuff back.

04:00:46.820 --> 04:00:48.811
LIAM: Yeah, I was about to say.

04:00:50.035 --> 04:00:51.869
MATT: As the door opens before you--

04:00:51.869 --> 04:00:53.511
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

04:00:53.511 --> 04:00:57.991
MATT: -- the following chamber is
lit with a bright blue light

04:00:57.991 --> 04:01:02.551
that projects from the center of the ceiling

04:01:02.551 --> 04:01:04.612
of this nearly circular room,

04:01:04.612 --> 04:01:09.599
a very bright blue light source, affixed in the center.

04:01:09.599 --> 04:01:12.796
Walkways line the outer edges,

04:01:12.796 --> 04:01:15.371
while small staircases descend

04:01:16.212 --> 04:01:20.285
into the middle lower portion of this area.

04:01:21.594 --> 04:01:23.042
The far wall, you can see now,

04:01:23.042 --> 04:01:28.042
is adorned with an incredibly elaborate 15-foot sigil

04:01:28.434 --> 04:01:31.223
that wraps from the floor along the ceiling.

04:01:31.223 --> 04:01:32.869
Intricate designs that interweave

04:01:32.869 --> 04:01:35.722
like a puzzle of arcane inscriptions

04:01:35.722 --> 04:01:40.222
that rises up to wrap around that glowing blue source.

04:01:42.511 --> 04:01:45.132
You can see now, this bright, smooth

04:01:45.132 --> 04:01:47.922
cerulean blue-colored gem,

04:01:47.922 --> 04:01:51.791
about a foot and a half from edge to edge,

04:01:51.791 --> 04:01:55.958
that sits there above, roughly 30 feet in the air.

04:01:58.482 --> 04:02:01.492
In the far center of the room,

04:02:01.492 --> 04:02:05.421
you can immediately see

04:02:05.421 --> 04:02:07.838
scraps of a small encampment.

04:02:08.691 --> 04:02:11.922
Tents that have been pushed over.

04:02:11.922 --> 04:02:13.089
It's material.

04:02:14.842 --> 04:02:18.842
And what looks to be the middle of a heated fight.

04:02:20.151 --> 04:02:23.722
You can see other bodies strewn across the ground.

04:02:23.722 --> 04:02:28.147
Another figure standing down in the middle of that chamber.

04:02:30.120 --> 04:02:32.269
You see two humanoid figures are cut down immediately.

04:02:32.269 --> 04:02:34.781
(slicing) (thudding)

04:02:34.781 --> 04:02:36.198
Onto the ground.

04:02:37.450 --> 04:02:40.410
You see another one is left,

04:02:40.410 --> 04:02:43.119
lifted into the air by another figure,

04:02:43.119 --> 04:02:48.119
and you now see four other humanoids finishing carving,

04:02:48.749 --> 04:02:51.667
and standing back to return to the center.

04:02:51.667 --> 04:02:55.467
A woman is being held in the air, screaming,

04:02:55.467 --> 04:02:56.770
and the figure that's holding her,

04:02:56.770 --> 04:03:00.349
you just see a flash of nine points of red light

04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:02.389
(fluttering) across their body,

04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:06.677
as the screaming (snap) ceases, the limbs go limp,

04:03:06.677 --> 04:03:09.427
and the body drops to the ground.

04:03:12.387 --> 04:03:13.848
The figure then looks over,

04:03:13.848 --> 04:03:16.448
through the entrance to the hallway, right towards you.

04:03:16.448 --> 04:03:17.281
LAURA: Uh oh.

04:03:19.240 --> 04:03:22.400
MATT: (Irish accent) "My apologies, you've arrived early."

04:03:22.400 --> 04:03:25.067
"I was hoping to tidy up a bit."

04:03:26.180 --> 04:03:27.013
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

04:03:27.013 --> 04:03:29.338
(groaning)

04:03:30.273 --> 04:03:31.198
TRAVIS: Again!

04:03:31.198 --> 04:03:33.676
SAM: That is what we call in the business a quiff hanger.

04:03:33.676 --> 04:03:36.305
(laughter)

04:03:36.305 --> 04:03:39.206
TRAVIS: Oh, you've been sitting on that one.

04:03:39.206 --> 04:03:41.125
TALIESIN: Well done, well done.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:03:41.125 --> 04:03:44.012
TRAVIS: Taliesin, what did you make?

04:03:44.012 --> 04:03:45.194
LAURA: (laughs) Every time.

04:03:45.194 --> 04:03:47.892
TALIESIN: I just was like, "Hey, I wonder--

04:03:47.892 --> 04:03:49.263
"this'll be fun in act three."

04:03:49.263 --> 04:03:50.943
I just thought we'd be on the other end of it.

04:03:50.943 --> 04:03:52.202
(laughter)

04:03:52.202 --> 04:03:56.021
LIAM: Caleb, just with one foot, pushes DeRogna's body.

04:03:56.021 --> 04:04:00.321
(laughter)

04:04:00.321 --> 04:04:02.099
MARISHA: Tries to hide it.

04:04:02.099 --> 04:04:04.608
Don't worry about it.
TALIESIN: Take off my cloak, lay it over--

04:04:04.608 --> 04:04:05.524
(laughter)
LIAM: Yeah.

04:04:05.524 --> 04:04:06.357
TRAVIS: Wow.

04:04:06.357 --> 04:04:07.291
LIAM: Just a cat in a cat box,

04:04:07.291 --> 04:04:08.699
just shh, shh, shh.
LAURA: How big did you say

04:04:08.699 --> 04:04:10.531
the room is?

04:04:10.531 --> 04:04:12.241
MATT: The room would be

04:04:12.241 --> 04:04:15.521
about 45 to 50 foot from end to end,

04:04:15.521 --> 04:04:17.862
and it is a circular chamber.
LAURA: Okay.

04:04:17.862 --> 04:04:20.262
TRAVIS: Oh, boy, we are here.

04:04:20.262 --> 04:04:21.651
LAURA: It's happening. It's all happening.

04:04:21.651 --> 04:04:24.295
TRAVIS: We're going to have a great--
LAURA: Oh god, I forgot. I used up

04:04:24.295 --> 04:04:25.636
all my middle spells.
TRAVIS: -- great conversation.

04:04:25.636 --> 04:04:26.856
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

04:04:26.856 --> 04:04:29.818
Right, we had talky talkies, right?

04:04:29.818 --> 04:04:30.816
ASHLEY: Just some chats.

04:04:30.816 --> 04:04:34.656
MARISHA: Just a little convo.
LIAM: ♪ Final countdown ♪

04:04:34.656 --> 04:04:36.139
TRAVIS: It's going to be great. It's going to be fine.

04:04:36.139 --> 04:04:37.455
TALIESIN: I got a thing I can do.
LAURA: Oh god.

04:04:37.455 --> 04:04:38.754
SAM: Wow.

04:04:38.754 --> 04:04:40.871
TRAVIS: Oh, man, I'm-- okay.

04:04:40.871 --> 04:04:42.303
LIAM: I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

04:04:42.303 --> 04:04:44.283
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay, that's okay.

04:04:44.283 --> 04:04:46.563
TRAVIS: So there wasn't, like, beams came out of the eyes.

04:04:46.563 --> 04:04:48.023
They just boom-boom-boom-boom lit up red.

04:04:48.023 --> 04:04:49.223
MATT: They just all lit around him.

04:04:49.223 --> 04:04:51.306
Like, you just saw this black silhouette

04:04:51.306 --> 04:04:52.684
with the blue light from overhead,

04:04:52.684 --> 04:04:55.008
in shadow from the body it was holding,

04:04:55.008 --> 04:04:57.004
and then suddenly you see all these red light sources

04:04:57.004 --> 04:04:58.592
light up around the body,

04:04:58.592 --> 04:05:01.862
and the person in its hand just goes limp.

04:05:01.862 --> 04:05:04.562
TRAVIS: And it was Molly, plus one, with four other figures?

04:05:04.562 --> 04:05:07.434
And they had wiped out whoever was in there?

04:05:07.434 --> 04:05:08.295
Copy that.

04:05:08.295 --> 04:05:11.835
SAM: These eyes that appeared on the body,

04:05:11.835 --> 04:05:14.065
were they on the body, they just started to glow,

04:05:14.065 --> 04:05:17.876
or did they, like, get burned into the body?

04:05:17.876 --> 04:05:18.817
We don't know.
MATT: No,

04:05:18.817 --> 04:05:20.741
it was Molly's body.

04:05:20.741 --> 04:05:22.304
SAM: Oh, it was Molly's body that was glowing.

04:05:22.304 --> 04:05:23.137
MARISHA: Like, lighting up, yeah.
SAM: Oh, okay.

04:05:23.137 --> 04:05:24.824
LIAM: They surged.

04:05:24.824 --> 04:05:26.192
SAM: Oh, got it.

04:05:26.192 --> 04:05:27.331
I thought, I thought...

04:05:27.331 --> 04:05:28.917
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're in for it.

04:05:28.917 --> 04:05:30.208
ASHLEY: We're in for it.

04:05:30.208 --> 04:05:31.174
MATT: So we'll pick up from there, it'll be fun.

04:05:31.174 --> 04:05:33.400
LAURA: Oh god. Why'd you have to touch

04:05:33.400 --> 04:05:34.593
the damn oozes? We could of had

04:05:34.593 --> 04:05:36.076
all these spells available.

04:05:36.076 --> 04:05:37.991
TRAVIS: Don't get touched.
MARISHA: Don't get touched.

04:05:37.991 --> 04:05:40.458
No one get touched.

04:05:40.458 --> 04:05:42.218
TALIESIN: ♪ You got the touch ♪
TRAVIS: Beau, Beau.

04:05:42.218 --> 04:05:43.151
MARISHA: I know, I know.
MATT: Honestly,

04:05:43.151 --> 04:05:44.784
it wasn't until the shouting

04:05:44.784 --> 04:05:48.706
up through the tunnel that the oozes were like, "Oh."

04:05:48.706 --> 04:05:50.416
(laughter)

04:05:50.416 --> 04:05:51.418
(groaning)
TRAVIS: Oh, we could have just

04:05:51.418 --> 04:05:52.805
been quiet, gone through.
TALIESIN: We have company.

04:05:52.805 --> 04:05:55.544
MATT: Stealth has a lot of benefits in certain spaces.

04:05:55.544 --> 04:05:57.837
SAM: What was that spider?

04:05:57.837 --> 04:06:00.090
Was that spider alive. Was it just a statue?

04:06:00.090 --> 04:06:01.506
What was the spider?

04:06:01.506 --> 04:06:03.864
TALIESIN: If we had gone behind the spider statue,

04:06:03.864 --> 04:06:07.805
there would have been the slaying of the Nine Eyes Sword,

04:06:07.805 --> 04:06:08.784
and we would be like, whatever.

04:06:08.784 --> 04:06:10.477
(laughter)

04:06:10.477 --> 04:06:11.519
MATT: (silly voice) Oh well.

04:06:12.402 --> 04:06:13.235
Anyway.

04:06:13.235 --> 04:06:14.068
TRAVIS: Good shit, Matty.
LIAM: It would have actually

04:06:14.068 --> 04:06:16.539
lead to a door to a balcony overlooking the same scene.

04:06:16.539 --> 04:06:17.372
TRAVIS: Oh, damn it.

04:06:17.372 --> 04:06:18.286
Okay.
LAURA: God.

04:06:18.286 --> 04:06:19.581
MATT: All right, we'll pick up from there next week.
MARISHA: Okay, all right.

04:06:19.581 --> 04:06:20.724
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:06:20.724 --> 04:06:21.608
TALIESIN: Okay, okay, okay.

04:06:21.608 --> 04:06:23.882
MATT: Until then, thank you guys for joining us.

04:06:23.882 --> 04:06:26.281
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

04:06:26.281 --> 04:06:28.082
ASHLEY: No!
MATT: Good night.

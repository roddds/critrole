00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:02.752
MATT: Hello everybody, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:04.122
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:05.863
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:08.702
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.702 --> 00:00:10.392
MATT: Before we jump into our episode tonight,

00:00:10.392 --> 00:00:12.182
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:15.732
beginning with our sponsor for the night, Fandom Gaming.

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:17.505
Sam.
SAM: Oh, sorry.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.484
Sam.
MATT: Yeah, Sam.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.994
SAM: Tonight's sponsor is our friends at Fandom Gaming,

00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:22.682
makers of D&amp;D Beyond,

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.192
and their ongoing super sale on all products

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.782
from now through May 2nd.

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:30.202
They're offering 25% off all books at D&amp;D Beyond,

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:33.352
which includes the recently released Candlekeep Mysteries

00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:37.462
and upcoming Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft pre-order,

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:41.032
not to mention our own Explorer's Guilde-- Guide to...

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:42.692
I can't even say our book.

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:44.878
The Explorer's Guile to Wildemoult.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.642
(laughter)

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:48.592
Check everything out at

00:00:48.592 --> 00:00:53.166
dndbeyond.link/springsale.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.922
And speaking of spring sales,

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.552
after several hundred advertising gags,

00:00:57.552 --> 00:00:59.952
we've developed quite an inventory of props

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:01.052
in the back there.

00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:03.262
So inspired by the folks at Fandom,

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.075
I thought I'd do my own spring cleaning

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.722
clearing out the clutter to raise money for charity.

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:11.282
Maybe even to raise some money for our own

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:12.842
Critical Role Foundation

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:15.770
and their awesome 826LA fundraising push!

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.162
(gasping)

00:01:17.162 --> 00:01:19.962
ASHLEY: That actually, we do not want to be associated with

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:21.362
whatever it is that you're about to do.

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:22.622
SAM: I'll take that as a yes!

00:01:22.622 --> 00:01:26.592
So I've given the entire cast auction paddles.

00:01:26.592 --> 00:01:28.739
Go ahead and hold them up.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:32.522
And let's auction off some props for a good cause.

00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:34.072
Item one:

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:36.897
A bag of hair that I shaved off my scalp

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:39.332
in that haircut bit a few weeks ago.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.982
Smells like...
(sniffing)

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:43.142
Smells like Head &amp; Shoulders Extra Strength.

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:46.419
Let's start the bidding at 10 dollars! Anyone? 10 dollars?

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:48.732
10? Do I hear 10? Do I see 10?

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:50.202
No bidders? No bidders?

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.272
What if I told you this bag does not only

00:01:52.272 --> 00:01:54.021
contain hair from my head?

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:55.542
LIAM: (clearing throat)
I will take it.

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:59.032
SAM: Aha! Sold for 10 bucks to the creep who loves me.

00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:01.132
All right.

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:02.710
LIAM: What? It's for the Critical Role Foundation.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.041
ASHLEY: No, no, no, it's not! CRF, we just--

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:07.192
We don't want anything to do with

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:08.452
whatever the hell it is that you're doing.

00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:11.177
SAM: Thanks Ash, next up! Item two:

00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:14.454
My pink latex costume from
Gen Con a couple of years ago,

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:16.032
unwashed!
TRAVIS: Oh god.

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:17.288
SAM: Let's start the bidding...

00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:20.028
(sniffing)
Ooh, at 100 dollars.

00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:21.352
100 dollars.
MATT: I'll pay a hundred bucks.

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:24.382
SAM: Okay! Yes, Matt.
MATT: What?

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:26.672
It'll look good on the Playa, you know.

00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:29.287
MARISHA: That's actually a great point. 200 dollars?

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:31.701
SAM: Okay!
MATT: 300 dollars.

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:34.132
MARISHA: Hey, we live together, we can totally share.

00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:34.965
MATT: 500 dollars.

00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:38.899
SAM: 500! Sold to the man
who doesn't understand how auctions work.

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.165
Remember, this is all in support of our charity.

00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:43.589
ASHLEY: Please stop saying that!
SAM: Item three!

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:44.747
ASHLEY: No, it's not!

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:49.602
SAM: One bite guard, slightly used,
to prevent you from grinding your teeth.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:50.435
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:52.942
SAM: Nice, huh?

00:02:52.942 --> 00:02:55.962
Shall we start the bidding at some amount of money?

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:57.032
LIAM: I don't remember that gag.

00:02:57.032 --> 00:02:59.095
I also didn't remember this line.
It's not highlighted.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.222
Is that a prop from one of your skits?

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:03.952
SAM: Nope, I stole this bite guard

00:03:03.952 --> 00:03:06.462
from Travis' bedside table last night.

00:03:06.462 --> 00:03:09.034
Do I hear 50 dollars? 50 dollars, everybody!

00:03:09.034 --> 00:03:10.125
TRAVIS: Wait! What?!

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.003
That was you?
LAURA: How did you even

00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:12.836
get into our house?

00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:15.878
SAM: Through the vents! You should
really clean them out, by the way.

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:17.381
Do I hear 50 dollars?

00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.142
TRAVIS: I thought that was just, like, a weird nightmare!

00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:23.922
SAM: It was, it was!
50 dollars anyone? Do I hear 50?

00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:26.762
TALIESIN: Over here, I'd like to have that.

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:27.943
TRAVIS: What?!
TALIESIN: I'd like it very much.

00:03:27.943 --> 00:03:30.402
TRAVIS: Ew, why? That's my bite guard!

00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:34.222
SAM: Not any more its not!
Sold to the 30,000-year old man!

00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:36.302
TRAVIS: Why do you even want that?

00:03:36.302 --> 00:03:38.292
TALIESIN: I have my reasons.
LAURA: That's gross.

00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:41.722
SAM: Remember, all this money tonight is going straight

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:44.167
to the Critical Role Foundation.

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:47.602
ASHLEY: I will sue your ass, Riegel.
SAM: That's all the time we have.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.680
Back to you, Matt! Thanks, Fandom.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.359
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.926
And thank you, Fandom.

00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:57.832

00:04:00.812 --> 00:04:03.132
And of course, to join our live official,

00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:05.202
moderated community chat,

00:04:05.202 --> 00:04:07.625
please head on over to our Twitch channel for the show.

00:04:08.502 --> 00:04:10.422
Also, our Vox Machina Origins

series three, issue number two,

00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:14.622
is now available at local comic shops,

00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:16.544
as well as online digital platforms

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.622
TRAVIS: Number two!
(clapping)

00:04:20.622 --> 00:04:22.004
MATT: It's fantastic, I'm super excited you guys

00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:23.387
get to continue the story.

00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:25.330
ASHLEY: ♪ Give it to me now! ♪

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.161
(laughter)

00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.274
MATT: Oh, don't get me started on that song.

00:04:29.274 --> 00:04:30.201
♪ I want today ♪

00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.511
All right, Ashley, by the way,

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:33.111
since you spoke up, you have an announcement!

00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:34.835
ASHLEY: Oh, yes I do!

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:38.434
Okay, so thank you so much for your support

00:04:38.434 --> 00:04:42.101
of our Critical Role Foundation fundraising campaign.

00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:43.272
Sorry I said that so weird.

00:04:43.272 --> 00:04:44.521
(laughter)

00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:46.801
With...
(chuckles)

00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:49.018
With our friends @826LA!

00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:49.851
(cheering)

00:04:49.851 --> 00:04:52.201
So since we are pre-recording the show,

00:04:52.201 --> 00:04:55.661
the best way you can catch real time fundraising updates

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.381
is by following us at Critical Role FDN,

00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.101
on Facebook and Twitter,

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:03.581
and to learn more about our campaign

00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.601
to build a writer's room for students at Venice High School

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:09.321
here in Los Angeles, or to just donate,

00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:12.422
head on over to criticalrolefoundation.org.

00:05:12.422 --> 00:05:15.811

MATT: Thank you, Ashley.

00:05:16.644 --> 00:05:18.841
And thank you all so much for your tremendous support

00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:21.114
of the foundation and 826LA.

00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:23.371
Laura, you had some quick announcements to make?

00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:26.681
LAURA: Oh yeah! I just have
one little thing to say right here.

00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:30.179
So we made these patches for our live shows.

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:31.821
It's of the Darrington Brigade!

00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:34.201
It's like, you know,
LIAM: Love those guys.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.834
LAURA: Yeah, troop badges and whatnot, but

00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:40.215
we don't have a live show.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.571
We haven't had one for a while.

00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:45.526
So we put them in our store!
(cheering)

00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:47.391
So check them out! There's not a whole bunch.

00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:49.987
So they might already be gone! I don't know!

00:05:49.987 --> 00:05:52.570
(laughter)

00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:55.791
MATT: Perfect!

00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:56.641
Thank you, Laura.

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.661
And with that, I believe our announcements come to an end

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:01.851
which means it's time for us

00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.261
to jump into tonight's episode of--

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:05.601

00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:09.681
after making a new friend

00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:13.541
in the Aeormaton known as Charlie,

00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:16.606
dragging it through the rest of the Praesidis Ward,

00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:18.611
avoiding some dangers,

00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:20.421
encountering some dangers, getting a rest,

00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:23.331
you eventually found your way to the Genesis Ward

00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:26.211
where it seemed some great cataclysm,

00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:27.114
even more

00:08:28.381 --> 00:08:32.011
ruinous than the destruction of what you've come upon so far

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.841
seems to have carved out the center of the entire ward

00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:38.391
into this massive, lightless pit

00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:40.731
whereupon on the inside, you can see layer after layer

00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:42.571
of subterranean basement levels,

00:08:42.571 --> 00:08:46.141
some sort of a continuation beneath the surface

00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:50.201
where more arcane research once transpired.

00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:53.621
After finding your way down within a few of these levels,

00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:55.821
you did battle with a few entities.

00:08:55.821 --> 00:08:58.720
You managed to restore Charlie

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.591
to his former glory and all of his memories

00:09:00.591 --> 00:09:05.201
and found out that indeed the original name, Devexian,

00:09:05.201 --> 00:09:09.491
was what it once and now calls himself.

00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:12.641
Upon which, he gave you some information that you require

00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:15.481
as a thank you, but had his own business to tend to

00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:17.761
and left you abruptly.

00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:20.911
But you knew, thanks to Devexian,

00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:24.261
that what it is the Tomb Takers seek

00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:29.261
seems to lie somewhere in B-9, the basement floor below.

00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:33.191
However, the battle that transpired

00:09:33.191 --> 00:09:35.582
you found best to not necessarily see to its bitter end

00:09:35.582 --> 00:09:37.764
after banishing the remaining foe.

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:41.011
You all ran and leapt off the side

00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:44.611
to make your way past many floors in hopes of eventually

00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:47.161
finding which one was B-9.

00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:48.921
As you lept off the side, a few of you

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.611
managed to catch yourselves with some flight spells

00:09:51.611 --> 00:09:53.041
and sought to aid the rest of you

00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:54.451
to fall with Feather Fall.

00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:56.711
So now, as you all begin to drift

00:09:56.711 --> 00:10:00.071
downward into the dark lightless expanse,

00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:03.301
the first order of business, who cast Fly?

00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:04.901
You? Essek,

00:10:04.901 --> 00:10:06.621
and you with your sword,
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:09.288
MATT: Could you roll a d20 for me, please?

00:10:09.288 --> 00:10:12.705
LAURA: Oh no, you just got your hair back!

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:15.252
MATT: Four? All righty.

00:10:17.181 --> 00:10:19.411
TRAVIS: Ten.
MATT: Okay.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.141
So it seems that the Aeorian fields

00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:25.261
of strange, wild, odd magic

00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:27.411
did not affect those castings, so everything goes well.

00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:30.551
Feather Fall is below 3rd-level, so you're fine.

00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:33.751
But as you all begin to drift down...

00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:37.411
Who's keeping track of what floor?

00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:40.135
You were on and which ones are passing beyond?

00:10:40.135 --> 00:10:42.331
TRAVIS: Somebody that's perceptive, go.

00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:43.551
LAURA: I was keeping track.

00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:46.801
LIAM: Well, Caleb will assist because the Keen Mind feat,

00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:48.331
he would remember, even though I don't

00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:49.711
because it's been so long.
MATT: That's true.

00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:50.791
Go ahead and make a perception check for me.

00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.999
SAM: Is there light? Did you globules?

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:56.171
TRAVIS: My sword is glowing.
MATT: The sword is glowing.

00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:57.701
What did you get?
LIAM: I got a one.

00:10:57.701 --> 00:10:59.841
MATT: A one, and it is very bright.

00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:01.611
The sword is unnaturally bright

00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:02.880
from what you're used to, suddenly it's like,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.152
"Ah! I can't quite see."
TRAVIS: <i>Ja</i>, bro.

00:11:05.152 --> 00:11:06.831
LAURA: But I said I was keeping track, too.

00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:08.704
MATT: Okay, make a perception check as well.

00:11:10.901 --> 00:11:13.234
LAURA: I'll just move my auction--

00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:17.684
Natural 20!

00:11:17.684 --> 00:11:21.866
MATT: Look at that, back and forth on the scale. Damn!

00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:23.531
TRAVIS: (quick beat)

00:11:23.531 --> 00:11:25.311
MATT: Keeping tabs as you plummet slowly,

00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:29.011
thanks to Veth's magic. Watching as you go.

00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:31.371
And it's challenging because you'll only be able

00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:33.501
to really discern based on the

00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:37.761
fragments of light that reflect from Fjord's sword

00:11:37.761 --> 00:11:40.171
and your general ability to discern

00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:43.641
the dark, colorless shapes as you pass by them.

00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:45.671
But you count in your head as you go

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.061
between the levels, and they're scattered.

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:49.681
It isn't like each layer is an entire floor.

00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:53.121
There are different places beneath, an odd pattern

00:11:53.121 --> 00:11:54.351
as they were constructed,

00:11:54.351 --> 00:11:58.611
like a series of intentional, ant hill-type constructs

00:11:58.611 --> 00:12:00.181
beneath the surface.

00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:03.664
But as you believe, he began to count down to six,

00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:06.101
maybe seven, eight,

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.241
and you all began to hear, too,

00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:08.801
that sound of rushing water

00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:10.621
that you've been hearing in different areas throughout

00:12:10.621 --> 00:12:12.631
and seeing little bits of water and trickle

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:15.691
is getting louder and louder still.

00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:19.371
As you catch down to what the shelf of B-9 would be,

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:22.431
you see there is a wide, shelf-like platform,

00:12:22.431 --> 00:12:24.224
maybe about 30 feet across,

00:12:25.131 --> 00:12:28.341
and there is just water pouring off of it.

00:12:28.341 --> 00:12:30.911
Like it's a large, aqueduct-type vent,

00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:32.732
and it's just a layer of water, it's just...

00:12:32.732 --> 00:12:34.703
(whooshing) sprang off.

00:12:34.703 --> 00:12:35.611
And it's nine.

00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:37.291
And the tunnels continue down below.

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:39.151
LAURA: That's nine! The waterfall, that's level nine!

00:12:39.151 --> 00:12:40.896
That's level nine!
SAM: I can't get us over there!

00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:43.955
LAURA: Help! Help!
TRAVIS: (vrooming)

00:12:43.955 --> 00:12:46.622
(laughter)

00:12:47.655 --> 00:12:48.805
TRAVIS: Ferry tugboat.
MATT: Yeah.

00:12:48.805 --> 00:12:53.805
The three Team Flights are all
just slowly pushing the crews together.

00:12:54.568 --> 00:12:56.191
TRAVIS: Flying V!

00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:59.471
MATT: The gentle nudge you all begin to corral yourselves

00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.717
inward towards until eventually you all begin to step down

00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:06.731
(splashing) into the area, and the water
that's rushing past as you begin

00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:09.291
to eventually touch down, it's not super thick,

00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:12.141
maybe like an inch and a half to two inches tall,

00:13:12.141 --> 00:13:13.791
but it is a continuous layer of water

00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:15.441
that is now pouring through.

00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:16.421
And as your feet touch,

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.101
you can see it dividing amongst your ankles

00:13:19.101 --> 00:13:23.381
and beginning to feel a little bit of tension from it,

00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:25.336
pushing past you, but not too strongly.

00:13:25.336 --> 00:13:27.571
LIAM: I'm going to hover just above.

00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:31.276
SAM: If I'm walking on the water,

00:13:31.276 --> 00:13:34.591
is the current pushing me off?
LIAM: Is it like a treadmill?

00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:36.904
SAM: Or some sort of treadmill effect?

00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:41.741
MATT: Walk on Water is an interesting spell

00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:46.521
because you can walk across a surface that is liquid.

00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:49.411
I do not believe it says anything about being affected

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:53.046
by the speed in which it's going. I will double check.

00:13:53.046 --> 00:13:54.391
TALIESIN: Is it like a snowboarding thing

00:13:54.391 --> 00:13:56.331
where you can kind of maintain

00:13:56.331 --> 00:13:57.721
just by doing a little bit of left, right?

00:13:57.721 --> 00:14:00.081
And then you can let it take you when you need to?

00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:00.914
And kind of--

00:14:00.914 --> 00:14:02.991
MATT: "As if it were a harmless solid."

00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:04.551
So I would say no.
SAM: Okay.

00:14:04.551 --> 00:14:05.781
MATT: Essentially, there is...

00:14:05.781 --> 00:14:07.651
I will say that there's an arcane barrier

00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:09.811
that comes just in between where your feet

00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:10.921
actually contact the water,

00:14:10.921 --> 00:14:14.193
like a severely hydrophobic material.

00:14:14.193 --> 00:14:16.051
And you can just stay right there on the surface.

00:14:16.051 --> 00:14:18.821
So it is going quickly and you freak out for just a second,

00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:20.071
but your footing is still pretty solid

00:14:20.071 --> 00:14:21.211
as it just passes beneath you.

00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:24.341
SAM: I'm going to do some 180's.

00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:27.135
TALIESIN: What's the temperature of the water?

00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:28.376
MATT: Do you reach down into it?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:14:28.376 --> 00:14:31.721
MATT: It's quite cold.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:33.773
This is melting ice.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:36.571
LAURA: Oh, interesting.

00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:38.461
TALIESIN: That's my theory.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:43.241
Something hot up ahead, maybe.
LAURA: Ooh.

00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:45.331
MATT: As you all stand here on the broken ledge,

00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:47.001
the path continuing inward

00:14:47.001 --> 00:14:49.991
towards what looks to be the subterranean structure ahead,

00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:54.291
like a 50 foot-wide hall that you are currently standing at

00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:57.627
before it collapses down into the tunnel below.

00:14:57.627 --> 00:15:02.181
You can see maybe only a few bodies that still remain

00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:04.411
in the space strewn across the marble floor,

00:15:04.411 --> 00:15:06.621
partially submerged in this perpetual stream

00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:08.871
and not being forced out because they've been caught

00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:10.361
on some of the rubble and fallen debris

00:15:10.361 --> 00:15:11.601
that seems to have gathered

00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:14.404
at some of the edges that have held against the stream.

00:15:16.339 --> 00:15:18.761
And right off the right hand side of the ledge,

00:15:18.761 --> 00:15:20.161
to the right of where you all landed,

00:15:20.161 --> 00:15:24.171
you can see, there is the broken remnants of a doorframe

00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:28.355
and some sort of an entryway into a chamber beyond

00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:29.981
that has completely fallen

00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:32.311
or was carved off with the destruction

00:15:32.311 --> 00:15:34.171
that transpired behind you.

00:15:34.171 --> 00:15:36.921
So you're standing partially in this large hall

00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:39.701
and one of the large chambers that it connected to

00:15:39.701 --> 00:15:41.551
no longer exists.

00:15:41.551 --> 00:15:45.551
Looking ahead, in a westward direction

00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:47.721
you see a small set of four stairs

00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:51.511
that lead up into an arched hallway.

00:15:51.511 --> 00:15:54.991
And that currently appears to be the only place

00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:57.271
from this particular platform that you could head.

00:15:57.271 --> 00:15:58.971
LAURA: And water's pouring down from the hallway.

00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:00.262
MATT: Correct, and as you look ahead,

00:16:00.262 --> 00:16:02.904
you could see it like cascading down the stairs.

00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:07.541
MARISHA: Any writing? Does it look-- any--

00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:10.364
Once again, any signs or anything over the gateway?

00:16:13.134 --> 00:16:14.693
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:20.229
MARISHA: 12.
MATT: 12?

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:22.801
You do not see anything, unfortunately.

00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:24.231
Interesting point, though,

00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:26.131
as you gather yourself here

00:16:26.131 --> 00:16:27.221
and everyone's jumped off,

00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:30.054
you go to go for your goggles.

00:16:32.101 --> 00:16:35.284
But the shadows aren't quite as piercing as they once were.

00:16:37.323 --> 00:16:39.524
LAURA: (gasps)

00:16:39.524 --> 00:16:40.601
SAM: (gasps)

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:43.234
LAURA: Fucking eyes!

00:16:44.191 --> 00:16:45.224
MARISHA: I put them on.

00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:48.154
MATT: No real change.
MARISHA: No real change?

00:16:49.981 --> 00:16:52.229
TALIESIN: You all right?
LIAM: You, too.

00:16:54.791 --> 00:16:56.689
I wasn't sure.
ASHLEY: What, what, what, what?

00:16:57.549 --> 00:17:01.216
SAM: U2! What does that mean? It's a good band.

00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:04.771
ASHLEY: What's a band? I'm just kidding.

00:17:04.771 --> 00:17:05.879
TRAVIS: What's a Bono?

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.023
LIAM: You're the front woman of your own band.

00:17:09.023 --> 00:17:11.792
ASHLEY: I know, it was poorly-- It was a bad joke.

00:17:11.792 --> 00:17:12.781
SAM: She's just trying to break the tension!

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:15.151
ASHLEY: I'm trying to break the ice, so to speak.

00:17:15.151 --> 00:17:16.031
SAM: Oh no, no!
ASHLEY: And it's already broken.

00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:18.031
TRAVIS: The ice is melting, Yasha.
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know.

00:17:18.031 --> 00:17:19.440
What are you talking about?

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.551
(laughter)

00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:23.121
LIAM: I wasn't sure.

00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:25.061
MARISHA: Is it the same? Can you see better?

00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:26.511
Do you feel like you can see?

00:17:27.989 --> 00:17:30.854
The darkness or something else?

00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:34.121
Veth?
SAM: What?

00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:35.741
MARISHA: Put these on. Do they still help you?

00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:37.441
SAM: (yelps)

00:17:37.441 --> 00:17:38.924
MARISHA: You're three feet from me.

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:40.173
(laughter)

00:17:40.173 --> 00:17:41.823
SAM: I like to make things dramatic.

00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:45.344
Yeah, this helps a lot! Thank you!

00:17:47.071 --> 00:17:50.044
MARISHA: All right. Well, that
answers that question, I guess.

00:17:50.044 --> 00:17:52.221
LAURA: Hey, at least you're getting
some cool abilities out of it.

00:17:52.221 --> 00:17:54.454
LIAM: Can we try something?

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:59.401
Can you make your face look different? Like you do?

00:17:59.401 --> 00:18:03.202
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll try and look like Caduceus.

00:18:03.202 --> 00:18:04.552
TALIESIN: Huh, not bad.

00:18:06.774 --> 00:18:11.001
MATT: Where you both see the Caduceus face,

00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:14.371
it has a faint shimmer or transparency to it.

00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:17.401
And just beneath it you can see the outline

00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:20.576
of Fjord's facial composition.
TRAVIS: Oh ho ho ho, boy.

00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:24.231
LAURA: Whoa.
TRAVIS: What's the price, though?

00:18:24.231 --> 00:18:25.981
TALIESIN: You know, you two can use your words

00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.051
if you're doing like a weird psychic thing or...

00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:30.025
MARISHA: No, no, just processing.

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:31.971
ASHLEY: You two talking to each other now?

00:18:31.971 --> 00:18:33.901
LAURA: Can you read our thoughts? Can you read our thoughts?

00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:34.811
TALIESIN: What number am I thinking?

00:18:34.811 --> 00:18:36.254
TRAVIS: (like Caduceus) What number am I thinking of?

00:18:36.254 --> 00:18:37.580
TALIESIN: Whoa!
TRAVIS: (like Caduceus) Whoa!

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.430
(laughter)

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:44.121
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I wasn't sure.

00:18:48.401 --> 00:18:53.396
I was watching you talk to your friend.

00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:55.211
LAURA: Arty?
LIAM: Yeah.

00:18:55.211 --> 00:18:56.261
LAURA: Could you see Arty?

00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:58.311
LIAM: I could see Sprinkle

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.254
whispering in your ear.

00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:03.204
SAM: Sprinkle?

00:19:04.468 --> 00:19:06.220
Sprinkle's been dead for centuries.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.781
(laughter)

00:19:10.781 --> 00:19:13.064
LIAM: Is that something that you

00:19:13.064 --> 00:19:14.811
have been keeping to yourself?

00:19:14.811 --> 00:19:15.936
LAURA: Wait, what?

00:19:17.268 --> 00:19:20.051
LIAM: Yeah, once when I was a monkey

00:19:20.051 --> 00:19:23.051
and then later you talked to him again

00:19:23.051 --> 00:19:24.701
and when you were talking to him--

00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:28.218
SAM: Talking to Sprinkle?
LIAM: -- Sprinkle was

00:19:28.218 --> 00:19:30.071
chittering in your ear.

00:19:30.071 --> 00:19:31.161
LAURA: (gasps)

00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:33.961
MATT: You see Sprinkle slowly emerge from around her neck

00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:36.931
and look up with the eyes and--

00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:41.101
The glance over of the weasel and go,

00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:43.231
(as Artagan) "Well, how else was I supposed to stay with you--"
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up!

00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:44.503
MATT: "-- and keep tabs on you?"

00:19:44.503 --> 00:19:46.229
TRAVIS: Shut up!
SAM: What's happening?

00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:49.248
LAURA: You little sneaky! Oh my gosh.

00:19:49.248 --> 00:19:51.934
And you've just been here the whole time?!

00:19:51.934 --> 00:19:53.361
MATT: "I told you I'd be keeping an eye."

00:19:53.361 --> 00:19:55.771
LAURA: I love you so much, Arty.

00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:59.699
Should I call you Sprinkle? Should I call you Sprarty?

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.598
TRAVIS: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Ugh.

00:20:02.764 --> 00:20:04.969
MATT: "Stick with Arty for now."
TRAVIS: Sprinkle is the Traveler?!

00:20:04.969 --> 00:20:08.022
LAURA: Of course he is! That makes perfect sense.

00:20:08.022 --> 00:20:10.831
LIAM: It's the only reason he's still alive.

00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:12.231
MATT: "You're not entirely wrong,

00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:14.494
"and it's been a journey."
SAM: Wait a second.

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:16.152
MATT: He shakes off a bit.

00:20:16.152 --> 00:20:17.202
SAM: Did you know this?

00:20:17.202 --> 00:20:19.382
LAURA: (laughs) No!
ASHLEY: How did you know?

00:20:20.924 --> 00:20:22.551
LIAM: I wasn't sure if--

00:20:22.551 --> 00:20:24.434
I thought maybe I was imagining it, the first.

00:20:24.434 --> 00:20:27.591
I was a giant chimp, but then I saw it again,

00:20:28.631 --> 00:20:30.201
and then I started to--

00:20:31.341 --> 00:20:33.041
But I wasn't sure.

00:20:33.041 --> 00:20:34.914
LAURA: (gasps) You!

00:20:34.914 --> 00:20:36.555
MARISHA: Is there anything weird I have that I

00:20:36.555 --> 00:20:37.830
should have noticed?

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.046
Am I missing anything?
TRAVIS: Did you know?

00:20:39.046 --> 00:20:40.526
LAURA: No!

00:20:40.526 --> 00:20:42.842
MATT: You weren't as close a proximity during.

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:45.309
MARISHA: I didn't see.
TRAVIS: I think we joked about that one night.

00:20:45.309 --> 00:20:49.020
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh)

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.284
TRAVIS: Fucking weasel. Shit!

00:20:51.284 --> 00:20:52.117
SAM: What?!

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.833
LAURA: Oh my god, it makes perfect sense.

00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:57.221
Have you always been Sprinkle? Did you take over Sprinkle?

00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:59.401
Did Sprinkle die and you absorbed--?

00:20:59.401 --> 00:21:01.435
MATT: "No."
LAURA: You've always been Sprinkle?

00:21:01.435 --> 00:21:03.211
MATT: "Let's just say the gentleman who sold me,

00:21:03.211 --> 00:21:05.076
"was surprised to see he had a crimson weasel,

00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:06.731
"but wasn't against selling it to the first person

00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:09.086
"he came across, which I counted on."
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:21:09.086 --> 00:21:10.994
I even put a little blue bow--

00:21:10.994 --> 00:21:14.701
a little green bow on you. It makes perfect sense!

00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:17.169
TRAVIS: He killed the real Sprinkle, just saying.

00:21:17.169 --> 00:21:18.648
MATT: "Shh!"
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:21:18.648 --> 00:21:20.891
SAM: Wait, there was never a real Sprinkle!

00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:23.300
It was always the Traveler?
MARISHA: Yeah, what about Professor Thaddeus?

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.596
He actually just was a dick? Did you know him?

00:21:25.596 --> 00:21:27.260
MATT: "He's just an asshole owl."

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.802
MARISHA: Well, what the fuck!

00:21:28.802 --> 00:21:30.961
MATT: "Spent a little time with him, kind of a dick.

00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:32.501
"I'm just--"
LIAM: That was Kord.

00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:35.841
MATT: "You dodged an arrow on that one."

00:21:35.841 --> 00:21:37.835
MARISHA: What other gods are animals?

00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:38.860
LIAM: All of them.

00:21:39.825 --> 00:21:42.087
LAURA: I'm so happy!

00:21:42.087 --> 00:21:43.391
Do you still want to ride on my shoulder?

00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:45.521
Are you happy where you are?

00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:46.404
MATT: "I mean,

00:21:48.506 --> 00:21:49.447
"it's pretty comfortable."

00:21:49.447 --> 00:21:51.708
LAURA: Okay. Hang out!

00:21:51.708 --> 00:21:53.701
ASHLEY: Didn't I bathe you one time?

00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:56.781
MATT: "Yes."
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

00:21:56.781 --> 00:21:58.901
ASHLEY: You scratched me, though!

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:00.602
MATT: "Yes."
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:22:01.561 --> 00:22:02.611
TRAVIS: What else have you seen?

00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:04.819
And how long has this been going on?

00:22:04.819 --> 00:22:06.131
LIAM: Barely at all.

00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:07.701
DM, point of clarification,

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:10.051
the first time, as Capeleb,

00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:13.061
was two eyes, then a night's rest,

00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:16.211
and then three eyes, and I saw it again.

00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:18.909
So it was already going on with two.

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:19.742
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:22.204
TRAVIS: But only for you?

00:22:23.313 --> 00:22:24.729
LIAM: No.
MARISHA: I mean, did I notice?

00:22:24.729 --> 00:22:26.841
Because I was using my goggles just--

00:22:26.841 --> 00:22:28.876
SAM: She's not very perceptive.
MARISHA: -- the other night, though.

00:22:28.876 --> 00:22:30.191
But I'm not very perceptive.

00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:31.481
MATT: There has been a progression.

00:22:31.481 --> 00:22:33.581
TRAVIS: Oh wow.

00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:34.481
MATT: Circumstantially,

00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:36.952
and with that particular element--
LIAM: There's light all the time.

00:22:36.952 --> 00:22:38.368
From Fjord, from his blade.
MATT: Yeah.

00:22:38.368 --> 00:22:39.542
LAURA: It's true.
LIAM: Driftglobe.

00:22:39.542 --> 00:22:41.884
MATT: It's been very situational. You guys have been

00:22:41.884 --> 00:22:43.557
instinctually keeping light up

00:22:43.557 --> 00:22:46.041
for a lot of the time, regardless.

00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:47.071
LIAM: Yeah, so it's--

00:22:48.176 --> 00:22:49.841
We can see in the dark currently,

00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:51.811
and we're seeing through illusions.

00:22:51.811 --> 00:22:52.644
MARISHA: And see through illusions.

00:22:52.644 --> 00:22:54.785
SAM: Wait, but you have three eyes, right?

00:22:54.785 --> 00:22:56.035
LIAM: It's D&amp;D truesight.

00:22:56.035 --> 00:22:57.881
SAM: Three eyes?
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:22:57.881 --> 00:23:00.728
SAM: Doesn't that imply that you have a third power?

00:23:00.728 --> 00:23:03.151
LAURA: You're going to be able to read our minds.

00:23:03.151 --> 00:23:06.778
What can Lucien do that we don't, that we noticed?

00:23:06.778 --> 00:23:07.619
What could he do?

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.373
TRAVIS: Dispel, see magic.

00:23:09.373 --> 00:23:11.857
LIAM: Their magical stuff, everybody's magical stuff

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:14.182
is not glowing around me, is it? No?

00:23:15.031 --> 00:23:16.634
MARISHA: Seems selective.

00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:20.401
TRAVIS: So you've gained abilities for reading the book,

00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:22.327
but what did you give?

00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:25.174
LIAM: Well, I think we know what's at risk, Fjord.

00:23:25.174 --> 00:23:26.641
MARISHA: (sighs)

00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:28.912
Yeah, nothing's free.

00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:36.791
I am going to look at Caleb, though, and be like--

00:23:38.349 --> 00:23:39.641
SAM: You're going to try to communicate?

00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:40.474
MARISHA: Can you read my--

00:23:40.474 --> 00:23:42.910
Can you hear me in your head, though?
TRAVIS: Can you read my mind?

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:45.321
MARISHA: Can you hear me? Yes. I'm thinking this.

00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:46.484
LIAM: And I'm thinking:

00:23:46.484 --> 00:23:49.296
She's probably trying to send her thoughts to me.

00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:51.001
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:23:51.001 --> 00:23:52.398
MATT: As she stares at you--

00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:55.174
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.
You'll hear the faint echo of her words.

00:23:55.174 --> 00:23:58.223
MARISHA: You do not! He does not!
TRAVIS: Shut up!

00:23:58.223 --> 00:23:59.701
LAURA: (screams)

00:23:59.701 --> 00:24:01.631
Just you? Just you?

00:24:01.631 --> 00:24:03.171
I'm going to try too, I'm doing it, too.

00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:04.010
TRAVIS: No, you're not.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.843
LAURA: Yes, I am.

00:24:07.451 --> 00:24:09.101
MATT: Nothing from Jester.
LAURA: Thinking something-- nothing?

00:24:09.101 --> 00:24:10.251
MARISHA: Nothing from Jester?

00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:13.660
Wait, but does it work for us doing it to other people?

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.001
Yasha?

00:24:15.001 --> 00:24:17.051
ASHLEY: Who am I in love with? Oh, that's dumb.

00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:19.431
MARISHA: No, listen, can you hear me?

00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:20.706
TRAVIS: Say it out loud?
MARISHA: Can you hear me?

00:24:20.706 --> 00:24:22.041
ASHLEY: Can I hear you?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:23.216
I'm going to try and talk to you.

00:24:23.216 --> 00:24:24.049
ASHLEY: Okay, let me see.

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:26.957
SAM: I will very quietly cast Message.

00:24:26.957 --> 00:24:30.371
(laughter)

00:24:30.371 --> 00:24:31.204
And just say,

00:24:32.742 --> 00:24:34.848
(high-pitched voice) Hey girl.

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:37.008
It's me, Beauregard.

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:37.841
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:24:37.841 --> 00:24:40.461
SAM: You want to get freaky?
MATT: Ashley,

00:24:40.461 --> 00:24:42.221
it's hard to make any of these words

00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:45.468
as two voices are competing for the attention in your mind.

00:24:45.468 --> 00:24:47.821
(gasping)
TRAVIS: Shit!

00:24:47.821 --> 00:24:49.961
MARISHA: So we can-- so they can't--

00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:51.841
But we can--

00:24:51.841 --> 00:24:55.423
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait! You have two voices in your head

00:24:55.423 --> 00:24:58.312
and one of them sounds like Veth?

00:24:58.312 --> 00:25:00.895
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:25:02.881 --> 00:25:04.814
TALIESIN: Oh.
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:25:05.681 --> 00:25:07.331
SAM: It's because you can hear my thoughts.

00:25:07.331 --> 00:25:08.372
You could have done that before.

00:25:08.372 --> 00:25:10.594
ASHLEY: I could have done that before.
SAM: Yeah.

00:25:12.361 --> 00:25:13.691
LIAM: I look over at Jester,

00:25:13.691 --> 00:25:17.234
and think: Testing, testing, <i>eins, zwei, drei.</i>

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.115
LAURA: Do I get it?
MATT: You do.

00:25:20.115 --> 00:25:22.534
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god!

00:25:22.534 --> 00:25:24.891
ASHLEY: This is the coolest thing ever.

00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:26.094
MARISHA: So wait but then, is there a--
TALIESIN: This is concerning.

00:25:26.094 --> 00:25:29.018
MARISHA: Is there a third ability that we're missing?

00:25:29.018 --> 00:25:30.259
SAM: That's three. Isn't it?

00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:32.171
LIAM: Dark, illusion.

00:25:32.171 --> 00:25:34.584
SAM: And telepathy!
LIAM: Telepathy.

00:25:34.584 --> 00:25:35.991
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
MARISHA: I guess I was lumping

00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:38.286
the seeing better into one.

00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:39.561
LIAM: Could be.
SAM: Don't get greedy.

00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:40.501
LIAM: We'll have to stumble on it.

00:25:40.501 --> 00:25:43.281
MARISHA: Well, you know, better odds.
LIAM: No, it's possible.

00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:44.681
It's possible that something else.

00:25:44.681 --> 00:25:47.189
MARISHA: Maybe they have vision insurance, or something.

00:25:47.189 --> 00:25:48.771
LAURA: It's possible that he'll be able

00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:50.281
to control you like instantly,

00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:51.571
like he can the other people

00:25:51.571 --> 00:25:53.116
MARISHA: That's still my biggest fear this whole time.

00:25:53.116 --> 00:25:54.769
TALIESIN: Definitely means he can probably communicate

00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:58.151
with you, and you can probably think at him.

00:25:58.151 --> 00:25:59.941
LIAM: He already is.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:25:59.941 --> 00:26:00.774
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:26:00.774 --> 00:26:02.081
LAURA: He's talking in your brain?

00:26:02.081 --> 00:26:03.741
He's talking-- can you hear him right now?

00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:06.271
LIAM: No.
TALIESIN: How about now?

00:26:06.271 --> 00:26:08.664
LAURA: Ask him where he is.
TALIESIN: Don't do that.

00:26:09.731 --> 00:26:11.505
Don't do that!
LAURA: Why?

00:26:12.685 --> 00:26:14.930
TALIESIN: He'll think about us. It's weird.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.981
(laughter)

00:26:16.981 --> 00:26:20.441
SAM: It's just wild to me that the least amazing thing

00:26:20.441 --> 00:26:23.969
about this exchange is that Sprinkle is a god!

00:26:23.969 --> 00:26:25.911
(laughter)

00:26:25.911 --> 00:26:27.121
LAURA: I don't know, I think that's one

00:26:27.121 --> 00:26:28.758
of the most amazing things about it.

00:26:28.758 --> 00:26:32.212
SAM: I agree, but it seems secondary at this point.

00:26:32.212 --> 00:26:35.021
LIAM: I mean, he's also god. It's like the trinity.

00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:36.381
He is a god.

00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:37.581
He's not a god.

00:26:37.581 --> 00:26:38.541
He's a fey prince.

00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:39.374
He's a weasel.

00:26:39.374 --> 00:26:41.306
There's a third thing we haven't figured out yet.

00:26:41.306 --> 00:26:43.889
(laughter)

00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:49.661
MARISHA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Well, this is the thing.

00:26:49.661 --> 00:26:51.291
LAURA: We should keep moving.

00:26:51.291 --> 00:26:53.247
You guys should be <i>careful</i>.

00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:55.732
MARISHA: I'm also wondering

00:26:55.732 --> 00:26:57.923
if when Devexian said that we needed--

00:26:57.923 --> 00:26:59.864
SAM: (gasps)
MARISHA: -- to have a trained eye

00:26:59.864 --> 00:27:01.564
upon the gateway.
SAM: Sorry.

00:27:01.564 --> 00:27:03.141
MARISHA: What, did you just get the vapors

00:27:03.141 --> 00:27:04.281
just from me saying his name?

00:27:04.281 --> 00:27:06.551
SAM: I just swooned a little. I swooned a little, it's okay.

00:27:06.551 --> 00:27:07.631
MARISHA: Okay.

00:27:07.631 --> 00:27:10.324
LAURA: He was pretty dreamy.
MARISHA: It was really hot.

00:27:10.324 --> 00:27:11.561
LAURA: I mean.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:27:11.561 --> 00:27:13.021
SAM: Cut.
LAURA: Like,

00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:15.511
why would a robot need to be that attractive?

00:27:15.511 --> 00:27:16.852
LIAM and MARISHA: Why wouldn't you?

00:27:16.852 --> 00:27:18.691
LIAM: If you're manufacturing something--
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:20.421
Make it super hot.

00:27:20.421 --> 00:27:21.828
LIAM: Yeah,
LAURA: That's true.

00:27:21.828 --> 00:27:23.528
TRAVIS: Can I scoop down into the stream

00:27:23.528 --> 00:27:26.620
and taste the water? Does it tastes like salt or fresh?

00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:31.644
MATT: It's interesting.

00:27:31.644 --> 00:27:35.541
It's very cold and very clear.

00:27:35.541 --> 00:27:37.511
And then when you taste it

00:27:37.511 --> 00:27:40.634
it has a faint salty taste to it.

00:27:41.574 --> 00:27:45.431
TRAVIS: Slightly brackish, perhaps? A mix of the two?

00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:48.721
MATT: No, it's fairly clear. It's fairly clean.

00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:52.661
It just has a very faint saltiness to it. It's odd.

00:27:52.661 --> 00:27:57.646
It's not like an ocean level.

00:27:57.646 --> 00:28:00.041
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're in the middle of a land mass.

00:28:00.041 --> 00:28:01.681
MATT: Yeah, but--
TRAVIS: Ish.

00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:04.361
TALIESIN: What does that mean? I mean--

00:28:04.361 --> 00:28:06.674
MATT: Salt, bit of salt, taste is strange.

00:28:08.034 --> 00:28:09.034
TRAVIS: Do we know anything

00:28:09.034 --> 00:28:10.429
about the geography of this place?

00:28:10.429 --> 00:28:11.501
I mean, we're not on some sort of

00:28:11.501 --> 00:28:15.091
giant glacier ice shelf, are we? This is continent, yes?

00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:16.141
Earth? Rock?

00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:20.991
LAURA: I mean, I think Aeor is just a big ice. Isn't it?

00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:25.211
LIAM: Eiselcross is tundra, it's like our Arctic.

00:28:25.211 --> 00:28:28.529
MARISHA: Do we know? Do we know if it's an ice shelf

00:28:28.529 --> 00:28:29.783
or a landmass or--?

00:28:29.783 --> 00:28:31.624
MATT: You can make a history check, if you'd like.

00:28:31.624 --> 00:28:32.851
LAURA: Also, don't forget, guys,

00:28:32.851 --> 00:28:34.713
we have to do a Heroes' Feast today.

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.951
MARISHA: Yes.
SAM: While she's thinking about this,

00:28:36.951 --> 00:28:40.081
can I walk over to maybe the edge.

00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:43.804
There's edges of this river that's flowing? This stream?

00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:47.091
Or does it fill the whole space?

00:28:47.091 --> 00:28:49.301
MATT: It fills the whole hallway for the most part,

00:28:49.301 --> 00:28:51.951
with a slight edge where maybe there's a far end

00:28:51.951 --> 00:28:53.511
where a bit of it is out of the water

00:28:53.511 --> 00:28:54.701
because it's at a slight angle.

00:28:54.701 --> 00:28:57.391
SAM: Then can I just go to where it meets the wall?

00:28:57.391 --> 00:29:01.111
The sidewall? And just see if it looks like

00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:06.111
the water has smoothed out the edge of the wall,

00:29:06.491 --> 00:29:09.858
because it's been flowing for hundreds of years?

00:29:09.858 --> 00:29:12.111
MATT: Make an investigation check.
SAM: Or if it's pretty fresh?

00:29:12.111 --> 00:29:14.606
Okay.
TRAVIS: Fucking weasel's Artagan.

00:29:14.606 --> 00:29:15.631
SAM: 23.

00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:20.361
MATT: 23, you do see signs of erosion, long-term erosion.

00:29:20.361 --> 00:29:22.121
SAM: Oh, so it's not just a new effect.

00:29:22.121 --> 00:29:24.951
It's been melting for years.

00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:25.811
Thousands of years.

00:29:25.811 --> 00:29:28.301
MATT: In fact, the bodies that still remain in the water

00:29:28.301 --> 00:29:30.881
from what you can see, there is heavy

00:29:30.881 --> 00:29:35.151
general degradation to them from continuous,

00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:36.538
slow water flow.

00:29:36.538 --> 00:29:38.301
SAM: Wow.
TRAVIS: Salt water, at that.

00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:39.134
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:40.801 --> 00:29:42.151
TALIESIN: How old are these bodies?

00:29:43.724 --> 00:29:46.101
MATT: Make a medicine check.

00:29:46.101 --> 00:29:47.441
TRAVIS: Make a Caduceus check.

00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:49.523
MARISHA: I rolled a 17 on my history check.

00:29:49.523 --> 00:29:51.048
Which is low for me.

00:29:51.048 --> 00:29:52.053
TALIESIN: 19.

00:29:52.053 --> 00:29:53.871
MATT: 19. They're quite old.

00:29:53.871 --> 00:29:56.354
As old as any of the other bodies you've seen in Aeor.

00:29:56.354 --> 00:29:57.811
TALIESIN: But they're--

00:29:57.811 --> 00:29:59.311
MATT: The exposed portions of them that are

00:29:59.311 --> 00:30:02.841
up on the debris are as

00:30:02.841 --> 00:30:04.511
decayed as they can be, but they're not as mummified

00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:06.671
because of the proximity of the moisture

00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:08.121
and the elements that were in the water

00:30:08.121 --> 00:30:10.481
are grody and black

00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:14.545
and mostly remnants of heavily corroded bone

00:30:14.545 --> 00:30:16.634
and material.
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:18.691
MATT: For you, Beauregard,

00:30:19.586 --> 00:30:22.039
Eiselcross, there are--

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:23.471
The glacier elements are

00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:25.311
to the farther north of it.

00:30:25.311 --> 00:30:28.641
Most of where you are right now is just rocky continent.

00:30:28.641 --> 00:30:29.721
Though there is an ocean nearby.

00:30:29.721 --> 00:30:33.199
The Frigid Depths do surround Eiselcross, but

00:30:33.199 --> 00:30:36.421
there is a mountain range between the edges of the ocean

00:30:36.421 --> 00:30:38.654
and the ruins where you currently are.

00:30:41.037 --> 00:30:43.808
MARISHA: I mean, is it--

00:30:45.018 --> 00:30:47.628
It's so far, unless we're--

00:30:47.628 --> 00:30:50.898
TRAVIS: Very weird, especially for water to be moving down.

00:30:50.898 --> 00:30:52.408
MARISHA: Right.

00:30:52.408 --> 00:30:53.241
TRAVIS: From a--

00:30:53.241 --> 00:30:55.618
LIAM: Is it perhaps passing through something?

00:30:55.618 --> 00:30:57.288
TRAVIS: If it was an aqueduct.

00:30:57.288 --> 00:31:00.348
LAURA: Maybe it's coming out of a portal.

00:31:00.348 --> 00:31:02.138
This was the plane.

00:31:02.138 --> 00:31:02.971
MARISHA: The tethered--

00:31:02.971 --> 00:31:05.477
TALIESIN: Wow.
MARISHA: The plane tethered floor.

00:31:05.477 --> 00:31:06.332
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

00:31:06.332 --> 00:31:07.165
TALIESIN: Huh.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:09.156
MARISHA: Because we're looking for--
LIAM: Like in

00:31:09.156 --> 00:31:11.388
Rumblecusp, there could be a breach.

00:31:11.388 --> 00:31:12.342
LAURA: Exactly.

00:31:12.342 --> 00:31:14.010
MARISHA: We're looking for the Immensus Gate, but yes.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.261
TRAVIS: Instead of the Astral Sea,
there's a water plane, maybe?

00:31:16.261 --> 00:31:17.094
LAURA: Yeah.

00:31:17.094 --> 00:31:19.078
ASHLEY: Immensus Gate, that's right.

00:31:19.078 --> 00:31:21.198
SAM: If the water's been flowing for thousands of years,

00:31:21.198 --> 00:31:22.298
it can't just be from here.

00:31:22.298 --> 00:31:23.823
There'd be a huge depression,

00:31:23.823 --> 00:31:25.808
or something.
TRAVIS: I don't know what there'd be.

00:31:25.808 --> 00:31:26.641
LAURA: Yeah.

00:31:27.658 --> 00:31:29.351
MARISHA: All right, well.
TRAVIS: We should be going.

00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:30.348
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:31:30.348 --> 00:31:32.928
So, you said there was this broken down,

00:31:32.928 --> 00:31:35.818
clearly-collapsed tunnel off to the side,

00:31:35.818 --> 00:31:38.435
and then, towards the west, there

00:31:38.435 --> 00:31:39.372
is forward.
LAURA: We're going through the--

00:31:39.372 --> 00:31:41.368
LIAM: Steps up where the water's coming from.
LAURA: The stairs up and going.

00:31:41.368 --> 00:31:42.327
MATT: Caduceus--

00:31:42.327 --> 00:31:43.160
LAURA: (gasps)
TALIESIN: Yes?

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.501
MATT: -- Beauregard, Caleb,

00:31:45.748 --> 00:31:47.588
you've been discussing things,

00:31:47.588 --> 00:31:49.158
and there's been some noise around,

00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:51.308
but it's been pretty quiet in the vicinity.

00:31:52.338 --> 00:31:53.698
But, out of the silence that surrounds you

00:31:53.698 --> 00:31:55.808
in this open space, as hushed as you are being,

00:31:55.808 --> 00:31:57.371
you pick up on a certain sound.

00:31:59.967 --> 00:32:01.935
(coughing bark)

00:32:01.935 --> 00:32:03.898
(growls and barks)

00:32:03.898 --> 00:32:07.458
This distant growling bark sound,

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:09.634
way above, it seems.

00:32:10.618 --> 00:32:12.688
LIAM: Those creatures were canine

00:32:12.688 --> 00:32:14.078
that we tangled with above.

00:32:14.078 --> 00:32:15.088
TALIESIN: We should probably move.

00:32:15.088 --> 00:32:16.601
LIAM: Maybe more, maybe something else.

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:17.898
LAURA: Does it sound human?

00:32:17.898 --> 00:32:18.768
LIAM: No.

00:32:18.768 --> 00:32:21.458
SAM: Like back from whence we came up?

00:32:21.458 --> 00:32:24.028
MATT: From above, but because of the space

00:32:24.028 --> 00:32:25.798
and the openness of this area,

00:32:25.798 --> 00:32:28.138
you're not quite certain of the direction,

00:32:28.138 --> 00:32:30.148
plus the fact that you're inside a little bit

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:31.325
from where the ledge is.

00:32:31.325 --> 00:32:32.158
LAURA: We should move.

00:32:32.158 --> 00:32:34.583
TALIESIN: So it's outside of the cave we're currently in,

00:32:34.583 --> 00:32:35.874
but above.
MATT: But above.

00:32:35.874 --> 00:32:37.458
MARISHA: That--
ASHLEY: That doggy thing.

00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:40.233
LIAM: Those skinned doggies with the eyeball tails.

00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:43.918
SAM: Maybe it's Devexian is fighting with them.

00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:47.188
MARISHA: Well, yeah, or the Tomb Takers,

00:32:47.188 --> 00:32:48.838
because we could be ahead of them.

00:32:49.723 --> 00:32:51.348
Did it sound like a tussle,

00:32:51.348 --> 00:32:54.118
or did it sound like when, you know,

00:32:54.118 --> 00:32:56.731
the coyotes at night are just talking to each other?

00:32:58.098 --> 00:32:59.768
MATT: You do not have any experience

00:32:59.768 --> 00:33:01.518
with the creature that makes that sound,

00:33:01.518 --> 00:33:03.598
and you've never really heard it before,

00:33:03.598 --> 00:33:05.628
other than maybe some of the combat sounds

00:33:05.628 --> 00:33:06.461
of some of the creatures

00:33:06.461 --> 00:33:08.468
you encountered here in Aeor, so you're--

00:33:11.788 --> 00:33:13.068
Make an insight check with disadvantage.

00:33:13.068 --> 00:33:14.251
TRAVIS: We'd be ahead of them already?

00:33:14.251 --> 00:33:15.908
They would've seen us go whoosh.

00:33:15.908 --> 00:33:17.624
LIAM: He can't fly. We talked about that last time.

00:33:17.624 --> 00:33:20.078
TRAVIS: Right, but they could see us drop down.
LAURA: Oh, right, we might've gotten in front of them.

00:33:20.078 --> 00:33:21.108
LIAM: If they were looking.

00:33:21.108 --> 00:33:22.468
MARISHA: You said with disadvantage?

00:33:22.468 --> 00:33:23.449
MATT: Right.

00:33:23.449 --> 00:33:24.282
MARISHA: Insight?

00:33:24.282 --> 00:33:25.729
MATT: Yes.

00:33:25.729 --> 00:33:26.954
MARISHA: (sighs)

00:33:26.954 --> 00:33:28.020
Release too often.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.458
TRAVIS: Oh, that changes stuff.

00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:31.291
MARISHA: 21.

00:33:31.291 --> 00:33:32.278
MATT: With disadvantage?

00:33:32.278 --> 00:33:34.448
MARISHA: Yeah, rolled a 12, and I
have a plus nine on my insight.

00:33:34.448 --> 00:33:37.708
MATT: It doesn't sound like imminent combat.

00:33:37.708 --> 00:33:39.341
It sounds like

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.408
a call to hunt.

00:33:43.408 --> 00:33:44.241
MARISHA: Stalking.

00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:45.074
TRAVIS: Velociraptors.

00:33:45.074 --> 00:33:46.328
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Man.

00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:47.912
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: In the fucking kitchen.

00:33:47.912 --> 00:33:49.308
I ran out at that scene.

00:33:49.308 --> 00:33:51.268
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what it sounded like.

00:33:51.268 --> 00:33:52.338
TALIESIN: We don't have any way

00:33:52.338 --> 00:33:55.318
of sealing off this cave, do we?

00:33:55.318 --> 00:33:57.166
LAURA: Of scrying? Of what?

00:33:57.166 --> 00:33:58.728
TALIESIN: Of sealing off this cave.

00:33:58.728 --> 00:34:01.058
LAURA: Oh, let me see what I have.

00:34:01.058 --> 00:34:02.948
LIAM: What is the doorway made of?

00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:05.638
LAURA: I have Stone Shape.

00:34:05.638 --> 00:34:06.608
SAM: Fjord can shape the water

00:34:06.608 --> 00:34:08.358
into some sort of ice wall.

00:34:08.358 --> 00:34:09.655
MATT: The hall that you're in right now?

00:34:09.655 --> 00:34:11.415
SAM: Yes, you can, you got it.

00:34:11.415 --> 00:34:13.595
(laughter)

00:34:13.595 --> 00:34:14.478
MATT: The hall that you're in right now

00:34:14.478 --> 00:34:16.938
where the ledge comes is about 50 feet across

00:34:16.938 --> 00:34:18.578
from side to side, so it's an open ledge

00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:19.828
where the water's just pouring out,

00:34:19.828 --> 00:34:21.008
and off the side.

00:34:21.008 --> 00:34:22.418
Then the stairs that go up

00:34:22.418 --> 00:34:24.658
into the hall above looks to be about 15, 20 feet

00:34:24.658 --> 00:34:26.578
from side to side, and about 10 feet tall.

00:34:26.578 --> 00:34:28.193
LIAM: 20 feet? Oh, that's a lot.

00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:33.018
(sighs)

00:34:33.018 --> 00:34:35.858
TALIESIN: Might be a way to block it off, if need be.

00:34:35.858 --> 00:34:37.671
LIAM: How much stone can you move?

00:34:38.628 --> 00:34:39.461
LAURA: Um.

00:34:39.461 --> 00:34:41.868
LIAM: I could maybe pull one side of that doorway

00:34:41.868 --> 00:34:43.051
to the halfway point.

00:34:45.008 --> 00:34:47.398
LAURA: I can do five feet in any dimension,

00:34:47.398 --> 00:34:50.151
so I could probably close off a door.

00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:52.638
LIAM: I mean, I could close it off maybe entirely,

00:34:52.638 --> 00:34:55.168
but it takes me a while to do that.

00:34:55.168 --> 00:34:56.488
MARISHA: Maybe an alarm.

00:34:56.488 --> 00:34:57.920
Can you put up your wire?

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.348
TRAVIS: That might be the best, save your spells.

00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.288
MATT: (as Essek) "That is not a bad idea.

00:35:02.288 --> 00:35:06.013
"Trying to reserve what we have at our disposal.

00:35:06.013 --> 00:35:07.958
"(sighs)"

00:35:07.958 --> 00:35:09.888
LAURA: It could be cool to hide something,

00:35:09.888 --> 00:35:12.518
like something that will hurt them in the water,

00:35:12.518 --> 00:35:13.351
in the doorway, maybe,

00:35:13.351 --> 00:35:16.258
where we know they have to pass through.

00:35:16.258 --> 00:35:17.091
MARISHA: Can't see it?

00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:18.712
LAURA: Can't see it because it's underwater.
TRAVIS: If we're in front of them.

00:35:18.712 --> 00:35:19.545
<i>If</i> we're in front of them.

00:35:19.545 --> 00:35:20.628
SAM: We have the glyph anymore?

00:35:20.628 --> 00:35:21.918
The glyph's gone.

00:35:21.918 --> 00:35:24.578
LAURA: I mean, I have it still, again.

00:35:24.578 --> 00:35:27.758
Oh, wait, I don't have the supplies for it anymore.

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:29.010
It took a lot.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:29.918
TRAVIS: It was awesome.

00:35:30.778 --> 00:35:31.611
SAM: What supplies?

00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:32.841
TRAVIS: It was awesome.

00:35:33.888 --> 00:35:35.318
LAURA: Well, you know.

00:35:35.318 --> 00:35:38.998
Oh, I didn't prepare it today because I used it already.

00:35:38.998 --> 00:35:40.798
MATT: "Well, that certainly makes it easier to choose."

00:35:40.798 --> 00:35:42.733
LAURA: Yeah, sorry, Essek.

00:35:42.733 --> 00:35:44.116
MATT: "That's all right."
TRAVIS: Should we put a wire and move?

00:35:44.116 --> 00:35:45.408
MATT: "Regardless, we should move soon."

00:35:45.408 --> 00:35:46.537
LIAM: I didn't prepare that.

00:35:46.537 --> 00:35:47.370
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.128
LIAM: I can do it, but, again, it's a time suck

00:35:49.128 --> 00:35:50.509
since it's not prepared.

00:35:50.509 --> 00:35:51.616
TRAVIS: Let's go.
LAURA: What, the--?

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.390
LIAM: Alarm, 10 minutes.
LAURA: Oh.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.068
MATT: "Mayhaps just traveling quietly."

00:35:55.068 --> 00:35:57.608
TALIESIN: Let's just be very quiet.

00:35:57.608 --> 00:36:00.098
MARISHA: Maybe we'll find another opportunity for it.

00:36:00.098 --> 00:36:00.931
LIAM: Yep.

00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:02.598
MATT: So, if you all are moving quietly,

00:36:02.598 --> 00:36:04.326
I'd like the whole group to make a stealth check, please.

00:36:04.326 --> 00:36:05.159
LIAM: Okay.

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:06.688
I think my Fly has probably petered out

00:36:06.688 --> 00:36:07.980
after all that discussion.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.338
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Oh, Blessing of the Trickster

00:36:10.338 --> 00:36:11.668
so you get advantage.

00:36:11.668 --> 00:36:13.168
TRAVIS: Mine's up for an hour, so I'm just going to--

00:36:13.168 --> 00:36:15.009
LAURA: Oh, who needs advantage?

00:36:15.009 --> 00:36:15.858
TALIESIN: I do.
LAURA: Advantage on--

00:36:15.858 --> 00:36:18.222
Sorry, I already gave it to Caduceus.

00:36:18.222 --> 00:36:19.395
LIAM: Well, I got a six.

00:36:19.395 --> 00:36:20.358
LIAM: A six?
LAURA: It doesn't count

00:36:20.358 --> 00:36:21.978
after you've already rolled anyway, so.

00:36:21.978 --> 00:36:22.998
MATT: Yep, six?

00:36:22.998 --> 00:36:24.581
TRAVIS: I'm flying, do I need to roll?

00:36:26.687 --> 00:36:28.838
MATT: Because you're--
TRAVIS: Fly lasts for--

00:36:28.838 --> 00:36:29.771
MATT: How long does Fly last?

00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:32.168
TRAVIS: 10...
LIAM: 10 minutes for me.

00:36:32.168 --> 00:36:33.446
MATT: 10 minutes?

00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:34.540
TRAVIS: Oh, it's 10 minutes, yeah.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.631
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: I thought it was an hour.

00:36:35.631 --> 00:36:37.728
I'm full of shit.

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:39.318
15.

00:36:39.318 --> 00:36:40.168
MATT: 15, all right.

00:36:40.168 --> 00:36:41.001
LAURA: 15 as well.

00:36:41.001 --> 00:36:41.834
MATT: Okay.

00:36:41.834 --> 00:36:43.548
SAM: 32.
LIAM: Yes.

00:36:43.548 --> 00:36:44.428
ASHLEY: 15.

00:36:44.428 --> 00:36:46.121
I'm sorry, 13.

00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:47.438
TALIESIN: 21.

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:48.388
MARISHA: 12.

00:36:48.388 --> 00:36:50.028
LAURA: Whoa, we rolled bad.

00:36:50.028 --> 00:36:51.044
SAM: Yeah, you did.

00:36:51.044 --> 00:36:51.877
MATT: All right.

00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:53.184
LIAM: ♪ Splish, splash, I was taking a bath ♪

00:36:53.184 --> 00:36:57.091
MATT: So, as you all carefully progress,

00:36:58.148 --> 00:37:02.138
gently (water splashing) through the water

00:37:02.138 --> 00:37:03.588
as you begin to ascend the stairs,

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.968
can I get a marching order as you step into the hallway?

00:37:05.968 --> 00:37:09.458
There's enough room for you to travel by tightly,

00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:12.278
you know, somewhat, four at a time,

00:37:12.278 --> 00:37:15.238
or you can do three comfortably.

00:37:15.238 --> 00:37:16.295
MARISHA: I'll take the front-ish.

00:37:16.295 --> 00:37:19.303
TRAVIS: I'll be up there with Beau as well.

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:22.383
LAURA: Would I be able to tell that we're splashing a lot?

00:37:22.383 --> 00:37:23.216
SAM: Eh.

00:37:23.216 --> 00:37:24.188
MATT: I mean, every step you take is stepping

00:37:24.188 --> 00:37:25.518
into about two inches of water,

00:37:25.518 --> 00:37:27.978
so it's not making a huge splashing sound.

00:37:27.978 --> 00:37:29.261
You're just trying to be quiet before

00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:31.219
it breaks the surface every time, and-- (water splashing)

00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:33.728
TRAVIS: Plus, there's running water, so it'll get lost

00:37:33.728 --> 00:37:35.468
in the--
LAURA: Okay, okay.

00:37:35.468 --> 00:37:36.948
MATT: Correct.

00:37:36.948 --> 00:37:39.278
Hopefully, it's enough.
ASHLEY: Scent would be washed away.

00:37:39.278 --> 00:37:40.608
LAURA: I could cast Pass Without a Trace,

00:37:40.608 --> 00:37:42.588
but we've already rolled.

00:37:42.588 --> 00:37:44.778
TRAVIS: Jester, why don't you join us in the front?

00:37:44.778 --> 00:37:46.335
LAURA: Okay, I'll come up to the front.

00:37:46.335 --> 00:37:48.218
MATT: Okay, so Jester, and Beau, and Fjord are in front?

00:37:48.218 --> 00:37:49.051
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:50.581
MATT: All right, who's in the next wave?

00:37:51.618 --> 00:37:54.728
LIAM: I'll be in the center of the pod.

00:37:54.728 --> 00:37:55.828
TALIESIN: I'll be on the left.

00:37:55.828 --> 00:37:56.661
MATT: Okay.

00:37:56.661 --> 00:37:58.008
ASHLEY: I'll go on Caleb's other side.

00:37:58.008 --> 00:38:00.298
MATT: All right, with Veth and Essek taking up the rear.

00:38:00.298 --> 00:38:01.545
SAM: Mm-hmm.

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:04.988
LIAM: So, as everybody is moving up through that hallway,

00:38:04.988 --> 00:38:06.721
Beauregard would hear in her head:

00:38:08.018 --> 00:38:09.541
Keep each other in check.

00:38:10.718 --> 00:38:12.325
Do what needs to be done.

00:38:12.325 --> 00:38:13.388
LAURA: (quietly) It's fucking crazy.

00:38:13.388 --> 00:38:14.576
LIAM: If possible.

00:38:16.838 --> 00:38:21.009
MARISHA: I just respond back: Haven't forgotten it.

00:38:21.988 --> 00:38:23.078
MATT: All right.

00:38:23.078 --> 00:38:25.208
SAM: Creepy.
TALIESIN: I don't like it.

00:38:25.208 --> 00:38:28.409
MATT: Carefully and quietly stepping through the hallway.

00:38:28.409 --> 00:38:31.992
(water splashing)

00:38:33.418 --> 00:38:38.048
It continues on for about 30, 35 or so feet

00:38:39.058 --> 00:38:42.818
before a door, a closed door greets you

00:38:42.818 --> 00:38:46.278
on the right hand side, and it continues on,

00:38:46.278 --> 00:38:50.068
and you can see it taking a left

00:38:50.068 --> 00:38:52.518
about 25 or so feet ahead.

00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:53.791
LIAM: So, door to the south,

00:38:54.758 --> 00:38:56.118
turn toward the north if it's going--

00:38:56.118 --> 00:38:56.951
MATT: Well, you guys are heading--

00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:58.698
LIAM: West.
MATT: West, so it would be,

00:38:58.698 --> 00:39:01.138
door to the north, and then it turns to the south.

00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:02.431
LIAM: Door's not on the right?

00:39:03.498 --> 00:39:04.788
LAURA: I'm so confused.

00:39:04.788 --> 00:39:05.971
LIAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Door's on the right.

00:39:05.971 --> 00:39:07.533
LIAM: Door and pass.
MATT: Door's on the right hand side,

00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:09.341
but you're moving westward.

00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:11.107
Which means the door would be on the north.
LIAM: Yeah, other way around.

00:39:11.107 --> 00:39:12.190
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay, got it.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.331
MATT: There you go.
TRAVIS: Is there a handle, a knob,

00:39:14.331 --> 00:39:18.338
any sort of marking to denote a way to open said door?

00:39:18.338 --> 00:39:20.248
MATT: There is no knob,

00:39:20.248 --> 00:39:23.248
but there is a faint, teal crystal

00:39:23.248 --> 00:39:24.888
built into a small--

00:39:24.888 --> 00:39:25.919
LIAM: Ah.
LAURA: Oh, yeah,

00:39:25.919 --> 00:39:27.979
use the key cards.
MATT: -- stone circle.

00:39:27.979 --> 00:39:29.845
TALIESIN: Should we?
LAURA: Yeah, try it.

00:39:29.845 --> 00:39:32.966
TRAVIS: Real quick, is there a covering of dust,

00:39:32.966 --> 00:39:34.308
anything that looks like it's been disturbed,

00:39:34.308 --> 00:39:36.548
or wiped, or touched recently?

00:39:36.548 --> 00:39:38.166
MATT: No, but, you know, as you're glancing around,

00:39:38.166 --> 00:39:39.515
you can see, the bottom of the walls,

00:39:39.515 --> 00:39:40.348
and the bottom of the door,

00:39:40.348 --> 00:39:42.998
everything here has, like, a slight blackish tint to it

00:39:42.998 --> 00:39:45.999
from just years and years of perpetual corrosion.

00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:46.957
TRAVIS: Oxidation.

00:39:46.957 --> 00:39:48.757
MATT: Yeah, oxidation, and just general,

00:39:49.668 --> 00:39:52.593
just slow destruction by the running water here.

00:39:54.918 --> 00:39:57.038
There is script above the door.

00:39:57.038 --> 00:39:57.871
LAURA: Mm.

00:40:00.288 --> 00:40:02.108
LIAM: You're a spoken language, right?

00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:03.748
And I'm the reader.

00:40:03.748 --> 00:40:04.922
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

00:40:04.922 --> 00:40:05.755
Um...

00:40:08.277 --> 00:40:12.178
1st-level spell, yeah, I will take out my little pinch

00:40:12.178 --> 00:40:14.798
of salt and soot, and drop it in front of my eyes,

00:40:14.798 --> 00:40:16.918
and cast Comprehend Languages.

00:40:16.918 --> 00:40:18.016
MATT: All right.

00:40:18.016 --> 00:40:18.998
LIAM: Whew.

00:40:18.998 --> 00:40:22.158
MATT: It reads, "T-Dock Project,"

00:40:22.158 --> 00:40:24.736
the equivalent of T, hyphen, Dock Project.

00:40:24.736 --> 00:40:25.935
SAM: T-Dock.

00:40:25.935 --> 00:40:26.838
LIAM: T-Dock.

00:40:26.838 --> 00:40:28.258
TRAVIS: I'll cast a Divine Sense,

00:40:28.258 --> 00:40:30.658
and just see if anything is pinging from the other side

00:40:30.658 --> 00:40:31.630
of the door.
LIAM: T-Dock.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.463
MATT: Okay.

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:35.321
You concentrate, extend your senses.

00:40:36.608 --> 00:40:37.498
Nothing.

00:40:37.498 --> 00:40:38.331
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:40:39.169 --> 00:40:40.002
LAURA: Does that ring a bell

00:40:40.002 --> 00:40:42.408
with any of the papers that you were looking at?

00:40:42.408 --> 00:40:44.038
LIAM: I don't think so.

00:40:44.038 --> 00:40:44.871
MATT: Not currently.

00:40:44.871 --> 00:40:46.458
LIAM: Not in Liam's brain.

00:40:46.458 --> 00:40:49.478
I'm going to start a swirl of a Fire Bolt in my hand,

00:40:49.478 --> 00:40:52.218
and just be ready if something obviously comes thrusting

00:40:52.218 --> 00:40:53.988
out of the door just to kill us.

00:40:53.988 --> 00:40:54.821
MATT: All right.

00:40:54.821 --> 00:40:56.338
TALIESIN: Am I opening the door?

00:40:56.338 --> 00:40:57.171
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:40:57.171 --> 00:40:59.408
TALIESIN: Give it a swipe with the teal.

00:40:59.408 --> 00:41:01.618
MATT: As you do, the gem, both in your bracelet,

00:41:01.618 --> 00:41:04.128
and in the front little lock mechanism here,

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:07.148
glow for a moment, and you hear this grinding sound,

00:41:07.148 --> 00:41:09.348
this (grinding) as it seems

00:41:09.348 --> 00:41:13.578
like 1,000 years of stillness suddenly have to shift,

00:41:13.578 --> 00:41:16.618
and slowly (grinding) it opens halfway

00:41:16.618 --> 00:41:17.768
before coming to rest,

00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:20.311
enough for somebody to squeeze through one at a time.

00:41:21.168 --> 00:41:23.388
LAURA: Can we see anything beyond the door?

00:41:23.388 --> 00:41:24.968
MATT: There is no light source within,

00:41:24.968 --> 00:41:26.798
but for now, pretty much all of you,

00:41:26.798 --> 00:41:28.098
that's not an issue at that point,

00:41:28.098 --> 00:41:29.608
except for, maybe, Caduceus.

00:41:29.608 --> 00:41:30.808
TALIESIN: Can we hear anything?

00:41:30.808 --> 00:41:32.508
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:41:32.508 --> 00:41:33.876
LIAM: You have the goggles now, right?

00:41:33.876 --> 00:41:34.848
SAM: Mm-hmm.

00:41:34.848 --> 00:41:35.681
TALIESIN: 24.

00:41:35.681 --> 00:41:39.328
MATT: 24, nothing, silent.

00:41:39.328 --> 00:41:41.168
TRAVIS: 60 feet darkvision over his shoulder.

00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:42.001
MATT: Indeed.

00:41:42.001 --> 00:41:45.108
Glancing through, you can see another hallway,

00:41:45.108 --> 00:41:45.941
a little bit thinner

00:41:45.941 --> 00:41:47.488
than the one you've currently been walking through,

00:41:47.488 --> 00:41:49.778
for about 20 or so feet before opening

00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:51.368
into another chamber,

00:41:51.368 --> 00:41:54.928
where you can see some more scattered destruction,

00:41:54.928 --> 00:41:57.568
and some broken elements,

00:41:57.568 --> 00:42:00.488
and, actually, you see the other side of the wall.

00:42:00.488 --> 00:42:03.008
You see the 20-foot hallway that continues on,

00:42:03.008 --> 00:42:06.575
and you see this entire, another 20-foot-wide chamber

00:42:06.575 --> 00:42:07.798
that ends on the opposite side.

00:42:07.798 --> 00:42:11.643
You see some sort of a raised platform, some debris,

00:42:12.851 --> 00:42:15.478
a scattering of papers and other things

00:42:15.478 --> 00:42:17.128
around parts of the floor.

00:42:17.128 --> 00:42:19.370
TRAVIS: If there was a remnant of a doorway behind us,

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.988
and this is another door, this could be an aqueduct,

00:42:21.988 --> 00:42:23.028
or a means of travel,

00:42:23.028 --> 00:42:26.568
so this could just be a big-ass water pipe, essentially.

00:42:26.568 --> 00:42:29.148
This might be the way we need to go,

00:42:29.148 --> 00:42:31.218
rather than onward, west.

00:42:31.218 --> 00:42:34.201
TALIESIN: I found that confusing, but I'll trust you.

00:42:34.201 --> 00:42:37.098
LAURA: Caduceus, did you prepare Find the Path today?

00:42:37.098 --> 00:42:39.448
TALIESIN: I, uh--

00:42:39.448 --> 00:42:40.948
SAM: Nobody prepared shit.

00:42:40.948 --> 00:42:42.978
LAURA: I have Find the Path today, I do.

00:42:42.978 --> 00:42:44.552
TRAVIS: What'd you prepare, Veth?

00:42:44.552 --> 00:42:45.878
Lead by example.
SAM: I prepared Feather Fall,

00:42:45.878 --> 00:42:47.094
which saved half of our lives.

00:42:47.094 --> 00:42:48.763
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you, Veth.

00:42:48.763 --> 00:42:51.898
SAM: And I also prepared these awesome goggles.

00:42:51.898 --> 00:42:52.768
I tighten them up.

00:42:52.768 --> 00:42:54.598
My head's a little smaller than yours.

00:42:54.598 --> 00:42:56.069
TALIESIN: I did not do Find the Path.

00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:58.618
LAURA: Okay, I have Find the Path prepared today,

00:42:58.618 --> 00:43:02.831
but I also have Heroes' Feast prepared today.

00:43:02.831 --> 00:43:05.688
SAM: What do you need to know to do Find the Path?

00:43:05.688 --> 00:43:06.521
LAURA: That's a good question.

00:43:06.521 --> 00:43:08.468
SAM: Can you just say, find me the path to anything?

00:43:08.468 --> 00:43:11.598
TALIESIN: It will, it will point an arrow like a compass.

00:43:11.598 --> 00:43:14.228
SAM: But do you need to know what you're looking for?

00:43:14.228 --> 00:43:15.688
LAURA: Something that you're familiar with

00:43:15.688 --> 00:43:16.888
on the same plane of existence,

00:43:16.888 --> 00:43:18.838
so, if we know what the destination is,

00:43:18.838 --> 00:43:20.648
we're familiar with what it's called.

00:43:20.648 --> 00:43:21.481
TRAVIS: Which we don't know.

00:43:21.481 --> 00:43:23.528
LAURA: Well, we know, it's called the Immersion--

00:43:23.528 --> 00:43:25.368
MATT: Immensus Gate.
LAURA: The Immensus Gate.

00:43:25.368 --> 00:43:26.644
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.
MATT: If that's what you're looking for,

00:43:26.644 --> 00:43:27.618
then it would lead you there, yeah.

00:43:27.618 --> 00:43:29.518
TALIESIN: But I don't think--

00:43:29.518 --> 00:43:32.181
is it the path itself, or just a compass arrow?

00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:35.203
I can't remember.
MATT: That high level spell.

00:43:35.203 --> 00:43:36.718
I think it shows you the direct path.

00:43:36.718 --> 00:43:38.728
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's not the safest
path, but it's the shortest.

00:43:38.728 --> 00:43:40.361
MATT: Not the safest, but it's the shortest.

00:43:40.361 --> 00:43:41.521
TALIESIN: That's right.
SAM: Cool.

00:43:41.521 --> 00:43:43.516
LAURA: Like Waze.

00:43:43.516 --> 00:43:45.076
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:45.076 --> 00:43:48.337
SAM: Make a left turn, cross the 10?!

00:43:48.337 --> 00:43:49.684
(laughter)

00:43:49.684 --> 00:43:51.084
On foot.

00:43:52.067 --> 00:43:54.158
What? Okay.

00:43:54.158 --> 00:43:54.991
TRAVIS: Sure?
ASHLEY: All right,

00:43:54.991 --> 00:43:57.183
we'll get there three minutes faster.

00:43:58.728 --> 00:44:01.788
MATT: Helping overpopulation one
set of directions at a time.

00:44:01.788 --> 00:44:04.538
TALIESIN: Pay the ferryman at the LA River.
LIAM: Drive through Amoeba Music.

00:44:04.538 --> 00:44:06.498
(laughter)

00:44:06.498 --> 00:44:09.688
TRAVIS: And it's an hour for Heroes' Feast, to do it.

00:44:09.688 --> 00:44:11.038
LAURA: It's an hour for Heroes' Feast,

00:44:11.038 --> 00:44:13.798
but, so, both of them are 6th-level,

00:44:13.798 --> 00:44:16.107
and I only have one 6th-level.

00:44:16.107 --> 00:44:18.358
TALIESIN: It would be that and
burning a seventh then, which--

00:44:18.358 --> 00:44:19.191
LAURA: Yes.

00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:21.808
MARISHA: I say we keep looking for the Immensus Gate.

00:44:21.808 --> 00:44:23.488
TALIESIN: I say Find the Path is a last--

00:44:23.488 --> 00:44:25.218
MARISHA: Yeah, last ditch effort.

00:44:25.218 --> 00:44:27.138
TALIESIN: If everything goes wrong.

00:44:27.138 --> 00:44:28.048
LAURA: Okay.

00:44:28.048 --> 00:44:29.938
SAM: Wait, what do you mean, everything goes wrong?

00:44:29.938 --> 00:44:31.168
Don't we have two choices here,

00:44:31.168 --> 00:44:32.828
we don't know which way to go?

00:44:32.828 --> 00:44:33.708
LAURA: We don't know which way to go.

00:44:33.708 --> 00:44:36.168
This could lead us down a completely wrong labyrinth.

00:44:36.168 --> 00:44:37.518
SAM: This is it.

00:44:37.518 --> 00:44:39.988
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's either the tu-- well, yeah.

00:44:39.988 --> 00:44:43.108
MATT: You do see, the hallway that
you're looking into right now

00:44:43.108 --> 00:44:44.788
opens up into another room beyond,

00:44:44.788 --> 00:44:48.108
and you can see another wall

00:44:48.108 --> 00:44:49.878
at the edge of your visual range,

00:44:49.878 --> 00:44:51.178
so there does appear--

00:44:51.178 --> 00:44:54.031
unless that room goes into other directions,

00:44:55.178 --> 00:44:56.593
it's not a continued hallway.

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:58.359
LAURA: Oh, okay.
LIAM: Let's just stick our head in and look around.

00:44:58.359 --> 00:44:59.192
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:44:59.192 --> 00:45:00.025
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

00:45:00.025 --> 00:45:01.158
LIAM: Instead of arguing.

00:45:01.158 --> 00:45:02.524
SAM: Who wants to go in?

00:45:02.524 --> 00:45:03.357
LIAM: I'll go.

00:45:03.357 --> 00:45:04.762
SAM and LAURA: What?!

00:45:04.762 --> 00:45:06.457
LAURA: That doesn't make any sense.
SAM: You're fricking crazy.

00:45:06.457 --> 00:45:08.308
TRAVIS: I'll go.
TALIESIN: Send a couple of--

00:45:08.308 --> 00:45:10.146
ASHLEY: Oh, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

00:45:10.146 --> 00:45:10.979
SAM: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:10.979 --> 00:45:13.028
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't want you to go alone.

00:45:13.028 --> 00:45:14.758
LIAM: Yeah, you walk in front of me,

00:45:14.758 --> 00:45:15.591
please.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:45:15.591 --> 00:45:17.578
TALIESIN: Should a couple of us
stay on the inside of the door?

00:45:17.578 --> 00:45:18.768
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:45:18.768 --> 00:45:19.601
MATT: Okay.

00:45:19.601 --> 00:45:21.998
So who's going into the chamber, hallway?

00:45:21.998 --> 00:45:23.097
Got it.
LIAM: Only because I can read.

00:45:23.097 --> 00:45:24.497
LAURA: This is the one that he just--

00:45:24.497 --> 00:45:25.848
I'll go as well.

00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:27.728
MATT: So Jester, Yasha, and Caleb?

00:45:27.728 --> 00:45:29.788
LAURA: I've got Arty, nothing can hurt me.

00:45:29.788 --> 00:45:32.654
LIAM: Nothing can hurt <i>Sprinkle</i>.
TALIESIN: I think we're all going inside the door,

00:45:32.654 --> 00:45:34.288
but, like, not all of us are going past that.

00:45:34.288 --> 00:45:35.121
MATT: Got it, okay.

00:45:35.121 --> 00:45:36.078
So you're all staying in the hallway

00:45:36.078 --> 00:45:37.988
that leads towards that area,

00:45:37.988 --> 00:45:40.138
and the three of you are--

00:45:40.138 --> 00:45:42.178
LAURA: And we're going through the door that we just opened?

00:45:42.178 --> 00:45:44.438
Or we're going into the room at the far end?

00:45:44.438 --> 00:45:45.271
MATT: As far as I know, you guys are going

00:45:45.271 --> 00:45:46.128
into the room you just opened.

00:45:46.128 --> 00:45:47.438
LAURA: Got it, yes.
LIAM: Yeah, door opens, then--

00:45:47.438 --> 00:45:48.787
LAURA: Yes, I know, that's what we're doing.

00:45:48.787 --> 00:45:51.343
MATT: So, you squeeze through one at a time, that opening.

00:45:51.343 --> 00:45:52.891
LAURA: But <i>you</i> knew that.
MATT: Find your way through.

00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:53.724
Yes, indeed.

00:45:53.724 --> 00:45:55.498
Right there with you.

00:45:57.228 --> 00:45:59.768
The three of you, as you step within,

00:45:59.768 --> 00:46:01.688
the smell in here is different.

00:46:01.688 --> 00:46:05.888
There's an earthy elemental scent to it.

00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:07.491
It's hard to describe.

00:46:08.805 --> 00:46:12.538
And, as you enter this room, it is, indeed,

00:46:12.538 --> 00:46:13.768
20 by 20 feet.

00:46:13.768 --> 00:46:16.618
There does not appear to be a secondary exit.

00:46:16.618 --> 00:46:18.411
It is a contained chamber.

00:46:19.518 --> 00:46:20.918
It in some ways reminds you

00:46:20.918 --> 00:46:25.798
of the construction of the R 01, R 02 chamber

00:46:25.798 --> 00:46:28.641
that you had lept from not too far from here,

00:46:29.918 --> 00:46:32.068
though its layout's a little bit different.

00:46:32.928 --> 00:46:35.368
First, the walls in here, as you glance around,

00:46:35.368 --> 00:46:37.328
have a strange texture to them,

00:46:37.328 --> 00:46:39.888
and they are just continuous

00:46:39.888 --> 00:46:41.268
without any sort of additional grooves,

00:46:41.268 --> 00:46:42.598
or any other design to it,

00:46:42.598 --> 00:46:44.001
and, upon looking around,

00:46:45.308 --> 00:46:47.178
you put your finger across it,

00:46:47.178 --> 00:46:48.152
and, looking at your hand,

00:46:48.152 --> 00:46:50.761
there's a slight residue left on them.

00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:56.848
LIAM: Does the residue smell like the water?

00:46:56.848 --> 00:46:57.681
MATT: It does not.

00:46:57.681 --> 00:46:58.514
LIAM: Okay.

00:47:00.308 --> 00:47:03.408
MATT: Go ahead and make, any two of you,

00:47:03.408 --> 00:47:05.116
make an intelligence check.

00:47:10.198 --> 00:47:11.678
LIAM: Just add the modifier.
LAURA: Aw, it bounced up,

00:47:11.678 --> 00:47:13.101
and bounced off, that's not cool.

00:47:13.101 --> 00:47:14.098
LIAM: 17.

00:47:14.098 --> 00:47:15.498
MATT: 17?
LAURA: Plus--

00:47:18.011 --> 00:47:21.848
No, no, this is terrible.

00:47:21.848 --> 00:47:23.038
MATT: Okay.

00:47:23.038 --> 00:47:25.721
LAURA: Yeah, this is-- that's a eight.

00:47:26.568 --> 00:47:27.909
MATT: Gotcha. No worries.

00:47:29.298 --> 00:47:31.098
These walls are lined in lead.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:34.408
ASHLEY: I was just going to taste it,

00:47:34.408 --> 00:47:36.181
but I will leave it alone.

00:47:36.181 --> 00:47:38.897
(laughter)

00:47:38.897 --> 00:47:40.742
TRAVIS: (chomp)
TALIESIN: I respect the impulse.

00:47:40.742 --> 00:47:44.000
(laughter)

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.560
ASHLEY: I'll tell you what it is. (dying noise)

00:47:47.568 --> 00:47:50.638
MATT: You do see a multitude of material containers

00:47:50.638 --> 00:47:52.458
that are now askew and scattered

00:47:52.458 --> 00:47:54.888
across the floor, mostly broken.

00:47:54.888 --> 00:47:58.298
The water does not quite come all the way into here,

00:47:58.298 --> 00:48:00.478
so most of the floor here is dry,

00:48:00.478 --> 00:48:01.548
separate than the other chamber.

00:48:01.548 --> 00:48:03.368
It's at a slight angle,

00:48:03.368 --> 00:48:05.138
with whatever impact, it's been jostled

00:48:05.138 --> 00:48:07.471
from its initial placement.

00:48:09.777 --> 00:48:13.228
You do see, similar to the Rejuvenation Chamber before,

00:48:13.228 --> 00:48:15.858
another raised platform with some sort

00:48:15.858 --> 00:48:18.668
of casing and arcane construction

00:48:18.668 --> 00:48:21.881
affixed to its base, somewhat bulky and unrefined,

00:48:22.948 --> 00:48:24.458
which is odd.

00:48:24.458 --> 00:48:26.768
Most other forms of arcane constructions

00:48:26.768 --> 00:48:30.258
and/or enchantment-containing materials you've seen

00:48:30.258 --> 00:48:34.218
throughout Aeor, especially within this ward,

00:48:34.218 --> 00:48:38.578
have a level of refinement that is fairly consistent.

00:48:38.578 --> 00:48:41.178
But the previous chamber, the Rejuvenation Chamber,

00:48:41.178 --> 00:48:42.938
and even moreso this one,

00:48:42.938 --> 00:48:45.613
things appear a little more...

00:48:45.613 --> 00:48:46.796
experimental.

00:48:49.388 --> 00:48:51.578
There are no glass tubes in this one,

00:48:51.578 --> 00:48:53.998
but there is a deeply intricate runic circle

00:48:53.998 --> 00:48:56.708
sitting atop the raised platform here,

00:48:56.708 --> 00:49:00.331
where a lot of these devices, it seems, are surrounding.

00:49:02.966 --> 00:49:04.258
LAURA: Do you understand the runes?

00:49:04.258 --> 00:49:05.148
LIAM: It's not language,

00:49:05.148 --> 00:49:07.398
so it's arcane language.
MATT: It is not language.

00:49:07.398 --> 00:49:10.128
LIAM: Does it resemble anything from my experience?

00:49:10.128 --> 00:49:11.538
MATT: Make an arcana check.

00:49:11.538 --> 00:49:12.738
LIAM: Come on.
TRAVIS: Let's go!

00:49:12.738 --> 00:49:14.037
LAURA: Can I give him guidance?

00:49:14.037 --> 00:49:16.271
Since I know that he's checking it out?

00:49:17.518 --> 00:49:18.418
MATT: Yeah, I'll allow it.

00:49:18.418 --> 00:49:19.710
LAURA: I give you Guidance.

00:49:21.888 --> 00:49:22.908
LIAM: 31.

00:49:22.908 --> 00:49:24.436
TRAVIS: Fuck!
TALIESIN: Wah!

00:49:24.436 --> 00:49:25.602
SAM: D-damn.
TRAVIS: Woo!

00:49:25.602 --> 00:49:26.844
MATT: 31.

00:49:26.844 --> 00:49:28.125
TALIESIN: Didn't know it could go that high.

00:49:29.558 --> 00:49:30.488
MATT: You've--

00:49:33.748 --> 00:49:37.348
This is like if you had stumbled upon,

00:49:37.348 --> 00:49:42.208
after years and years of studying the greatest poets,

00:49:42.208 --> 00:49:44.858
finding the lost tome of the greatest poet ever.

00:49:44.858 --> 00:49:46.578
There is something about this circle

00:49:46.578 --> 00:49:49.388
that is unlike anything you've seen,

00:49:49.388 --> 00:49:53.214
and, while firmly based in transmutation,

00:49:53.214 --> 00:49:55.128
there's a level of intricacy

00:49:55.128 --> 00:49:57.008
that even you are having a hard time

00:49:57.008 --> 00:50:00.118
to grasp at first, until you realize,

00:50:00.118 --> 00:50:03.478
it's because it's not based in pure transmutation.

00:50:03.478 --> 00:50:07.523
It's a merger of transmutation and elements of dunamancy.

00:50:10.568 --> 00:50:14.893
In fact, with a 31, is heavily based in temporal alteration.

00:50:14.893 --> 00:50:15.926
LAURA: (gasps)

00:50:17.933 --> 00:50:19.001
(gasps)

00:50:19.868 --> 00:50:22.203
SAM: That means temperature.

00:50:22.203 --> 00:50:23.036
LAURA: Yeah.

00:50:23.036 --> 00:50:25.027
Can you make it warmer in here?

00:50:26.318 --> 00:50:29.298
LIAM: I wonder if Athodan stood in here once.

00:50:29.298 --> 00:50:31.040
LAURA: Who's Athodan?

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.078
LIAM: We just learned about him up above

00:50:34.078 --> 00:50:37.443
in the records room.

00:50:37.443 --> 00:50:38.758
LAURA: Oh, right.

00:50:38.758 --> 00:50:40.008
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:44.158
Should I go get Essek?

00:50:45.708 --> 00:50:47.138
LIAM: I'm memorizing the shit out of this.

00:50:47.138 --> 00:50:48.326
Yeah, that'd be a good idea.
LAURA: Oh, right.

00:50:48.326 --> 00:50:49.338
(gasps) Oh my gosh.

00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:50.718
You could recreate this later,

00:50:50.718 --> 00:50:52.498
and then open up a portal into--

00:50:52.498 --> 00:50:53.741
ASHLEY: I kind of speed walk.

00:50:53.741 --> 00:50:54.862
LAURA: -- fifth dimension.

00:50:54.862 --> 00:50:55.968
ASHLEY: Essek!

00:50:55.968 --> 00:50:57.813
MATT: "Yes?"
ASHLEY: Come here.

00:50:57.813 --> 00:50:59.598
MATT: "All right."
ASHLEY: Something interesting.

00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:00.608
MATT: Squeezes through the opening,

00:51:00.608 --> 00:51:03.218
and follows you into the chamber,

00:51:03.218 --> 00:51:05.078
looks down at, like, the scattered papers

00:51:05.078 --> 00:51:06.394
and grabs a couple,

00:51:06.394 --> 00:51:08.211
and looks over at you.
LIAM: See anything familiar?

00:51:11.038 --> 00:51:12.448
MATT: He glides forward,

00:51:12.448 --> 00:51:16.398
and starts looking over it in a very curious way,

00:51:16.398 --> 00:51:17.538
and then his eyes go wide,

00:51:17.538 --> 00:51:18.968
and then he gets down, like,

00:51:18.968 --> 00:51:22.558
on his hands and knees looking at it, and glancing about.

00:51:22.558 --> 00:51:24.375
LAURA: I give him Guidance.

00:51:24.375 --> 00:51:28.348
(laughter)

00:51:28.348 --> 00:51:30.108
(Matt rummaging through dice)

00:51:30.108 --> 00:51:34.607
(laughter)

00:51:34.607 --> 00:51:38.715
(laughter)

00:51:43.298 --> 00:51:44.873
MATT: "I've had theories...

00:51:47.531 --> 00:51:48.364
"but--"

00:51:59.338 --> 00:52:01.688
LIAM: What are the machines all around this circle?

00:52:03.088 --> 00:52:06.383
MATT: From what you can see around, a lot of them--

00:52:06.383 --> 00:52:09.518
some of them appear to be the equivalent

00:52:09.518 --> 00:52:11.358
of an arcane seismograph.

00:52:11.358 --> 00:52:14.900
They are record keeping,

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.298
and reading fluctuations

00:52:17.298 --> 00:52:19.788
in arcane energy, some of them even

00:52:20.628 --> 00:52:22.968
in different schools of magic,

00:52:22.968 --> 00:52:27.758
like there was some sort of tweaking and turning of knobs

00:52:27.758 --> 00:52:30.721
to see where a specific balance was, in some way.

00:52:33.098 --> 00:52:36.718
You can see the paper that Essek grabbed,

00:52:36.718 --> 00:52:38.018
and he looks down, and starts rummaging

00:52:38.018 --> 00:52:39.928
through some of the scattered notes,

00:52:39.928 --> 00:52:41.681
and small leather-bound books,

00:52:42.708 --> 00:52:44.071
starts glancing through.

00:52:49.594 --> 00:52:52.310
"This device borrows a lot of tenants

00:52:53.227 --> 00:52:55.888
"of dunamis development,

00:52:55.888 --> 00:53:00.196
"which even further confirms

00:53:00.196 --> 00:53:04.721
"that Aeor was dabbling in some familiar territory.

00:53:08.648 --> 00:53:09.978
"Maybe there's something here we can find."

00:53:09.978 --> 00:53:12.898
And he just starts to go rummaging through stuff.

00:53:12.898 --> 00:53:17.808
LIAM: And there's refuse, and shattered stuff around?

00:53:17.808 --> 00:53:21.058
MATT: Yeah, there's material containers,

00:53:21.058 --> 00:53:22.318
component containers that have been shattered

00:53:22.318 --> 00:53:23.388
and left to rot.

00:53:23.388 --> 00:53:26.298
LIAM: I'll start searching for anything written in here.

00:53:26.298 --> 00:53:27.723
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check

00:53:27.723 --> 00:53:29.188
with advantage because of Yasha's help.

00:53:29.188 --> 00:53:30.228
TRAVIS: With Essek going outside,

00:53:30.228 --> 00:53:32.828
I'm going to walk about 25 yards back

00:53:32.828 --> 00:53:36.408
the way we came, and just take a knee, and listen.

00:53:36.408 --> 00:53:37.637
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:53:37.637 --> 00:53:38.948
TALIESIN: I'm sitting at the door, listening as well.

00:53:38.948 --> 00:53:40.641
SAM: I'm coming with you.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:53:40.641 --> 00:53:41.474
LAURA: I'm going to help look

00:53:41.474 --> 00:53:43.558
for anything that isn't broken in the room.

00:53:44.598 --> 00:53:46.188
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

00:53:46.188 --> 00:53:48.831
So first, perception checks.

00:53:48.831 --> 00:53:49.820
TRAVIS: 18.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:50.653
TALIESIN: 12.

00:53:53.198 --> 00:53:55.068
MATT: Seems fairly clear.

00:53:55.068 --> 00:53:57.588
SAM: I'm with them, and I can also see anything invisible

00:53:57.588 --> 00:53:58.908
within 10 feet of--

00:53:58.908 --> 00:54:00.681
MATT: Indeed.
SAM: Or at least hear it.

00:54:03.244 --> 00:54:05.908
MATT: Nothing.
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

00:54:05.908 --> 00:54:08.409
LIAM: Natural 20 for a total of 31.

00:54:08.409 --> 00:54:10.398
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

00:54:10.398 --> 00:54:12.298
MATT: A lot of these are just general logs,

00:54:12.298 --> 00:54:16.028
like, day-to-day logs, quick notes about findings,

00:54:16.028 --> 00:54:19.748
adjustment of channeling.

00:54:19.748 --> 00:54:21.278
Actually, you would--

00:54:21.278 --> 00:54:23.958
Things referring to the primal artifact.

00:54:25.211 --> 00:54:26.368
SAM: Primal artifact.

00:54:26.368 --> 00:54:28.938
MATT: But what catches your attention is

00:54:28.938 --> 00:54:31.118
one of these thick log books, you open up,

00:54:31.118 --> 00:54:32.848
and within a quick glance through,

00:54:32.848 --> 00:54:35.698
there is an image that immediately catches yours

00:54:35.698 --> 00:54:37.566
and Essek's attention.

00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:40.960
It is a 12-sided object.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.268
MARISHA: There it is.

00:54:42.268 --> 00:54:46.318
MATT: To where, within, you can see artistic renditions

00:54:46.318 --> 00:54:47.994
of starscapes within.

00:54:47.994 --> 00:54:49.068
MARISHA: (chuckles)

00:54:49.068 --> 00:54:51.121
MATT: And as your spell is still there,

00:54:54.877 --> 00:54:59.470
it speaks of development between Athodan and Archmage

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.528
Ayoshadaf.

00:55:03.528 --> 00:55:04.558
LIAM: Ayoshadaf.

00:55:04.558 --> 00:55:07.078
MATT: And their study of the primal artifact,

00:55:07.078 --> 00:55:09.018
channeling the seemingly limitless source

00:55:09.018 --> 00:55:13.411
of temporal transmutation that is still vastly untapped.

00:55:15.005 --> 00:55:18.918
He believes one can anchor a point in one's history,

00:55:18.918 --> 00:55:21.343
and temporarily shunt oneself there.

00:55:21.343 --> 00:55:22.717
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: Fucking time travel.

00:55:22.717 --> 00:55:24.528
LAURA: Oh my god, they're Aeorians.

00:55:24.528 --> 00:55:28.058
MATT: If successful, expansion to designating anchor points

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:31.097
beyond one's own timeline may be possible.

00:55:31.097 --> 00:55:33.118
LAURA: (gasps)
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, temporal alteration.

00:55:33.118 --> 00:55:34.728
LIAM: And this is indicating

00:55:36.068 --> 00:55:37.737
this can be done with the beacons.

00:55:37.737 --> 00:55:39.470
TRAVIS: Don't give the wizard this.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:42.561
MATT: It's indicating that this device--

00:55:42.561 --> 00:55:43.553
LIAM: Here before us.

00:55:43.553 --> 00:55:45.619
MATT: -- right before you was the beginning

00:55:45.619 --> 00:55:48.173
experimental stages of sussing this out.

00:55:48.173 --> 00:55:49.006
TALIESIN: T-Dock.

00:55:49.006 --> 00:55:50.738
TRAVIS: No, oh no.

00:55:50.738 --> 00:55:52.318
MATT: You continue to read on,

00:55:52.318 --> 00:55:54.168
because you rolled super fucking high.

00:55:56.048 --> 00:55:58.468
It speaks on the experimentation process,

00:55:58.468 --> 00:55:59.658
after initial development,

00:55:59.658 --> 00:56:03.838
that an echo of the individual is left behind

00:56:03.838 --> 00:56:06.578
when they transfer, a shadowed echo

00:56:06.578 --> 00:56:09.468
that is the anchor of them to their own timeline,

00:56:09.468 --> 00:56:11.178
while they're shunted into their own.

00:56:11.178 --> 00:56:14.168
LIAM: So echo in present, full self in--

00:56:14.168 --> 00:56:15.927
MATT: Keeping them connected in their timeline.
LAURA: That's why they're in the bubbles?

00:56:15.927 --> 00:56:17.577
The echo is in the bubbles, you think?

00:56:17.577 --> 00:56:20.069
MARISHA: That's 100% what it is.
MATT: You don't know

00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:21.177
about that specifically.

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:22.788
This is dealing with this scenario.

00:56:22.788 --> 00:56:23.621
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:24.454
MATT: There could be connections.

00:56:24.454 --> 00:56:25.287
LIAM: Related.
MATT: That may require

00:56:25.287 --> 00:56:26.474
a lot more time and research.

00:56:26.474 --> 00:56:28.318
As you continue, perhaps.

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:30.218
TRAVIS: Plus, you could fuck with an anchor.

00:56:31.438 --> 00:56:33.258
MATT: Further logs speak of mages experimenting

00:56:33.258 --> 00:56:35.432
with the Temporal Dock.

00:56:35.432 --> 00:56:36.925
SAM: A T-Dock!
MATT: Which is the T-Dock.

00:56:36.925 --> 00:56:39.008
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:56:39.858 --> 00:56:41.808
MATT: Only spending a few seconds in transit,

00:56:41.808 --> 00:56:44.641
but the physical stress already proving worrying.

00:56:46.458 --> 00:56:49.708
Later experiments lament the individuals spending longer

00:56:49.708 --> 00:56:52.048
than predetermined within the dock,

00:56:52.048 --> 00:56:53.398
ending with the echo fading,

00:56:53.398 --> 00:56:55.148
and the individual never to return.

00:56:56.738 --> 00:56:58.398
And then the final notes complain

00:56:58.398 --> 00:57:03.028
of challenges in acquisition for funding

00:57:03.028 --> 00:57:05.778
and approval for continued research,

00:57:05.778 --> 00:57:07.114
and that's where the logs end.

00:57:07.114 --> 00:57:10.166
SAM: (scoffs) They never fund science enough.

00:57:10.166 --> 00:57:10.999
MARISHA: It's true.

00:57:10.999 --> 00:57:11.832
SAM: They just don't.

00:57:11.832 --> 00:57:13.788
LIAM: I look to Essek and say:

00:57:13.788 --> 00:57:14.868
Unbelievable, isn't it?

00:57:14.868 --> 00:57:18.008
Except I don't say it, I accidentally just think it.

00:57:18.008 --> 00:57:18.841
MATT: He kind of--

00:57:22.016 --> 00:57:24.933
"Like I said, it confirms some of my theories

00:57:24.933 --> 00:57:26.366
"on both sides.

00:57:30.128 --> 00:57:31.781
"If one could change the past..."

00:57:35.563 --> 00:57:36.571
LIAM: It's--

00:57:38.796 --> 00:57:40.504
It's interesting.

00:57:42.969 --> 00:57:45.008
MATT: "A chance to correct mistakes.

00:57:45.008 --> 00:57:47.501
"It's alluring, regardless of how dangerous."

00:57:50.408 --> 00:57:52.198
LIAM: Not enough to go on.

00:57:52.198 --> 00:57:53.428
Curious.

00:57:53.428 --> 00:57:54.320
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes, yes,

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.717
not enough to go on.
LIAM: Curious.

00:57:55.717 --> 00:57:59.641
LAURA: Yes, I agree. I concur?

00:58:02.828 --> 00:58:03.661
MATT: "Indeed."

00:58:03.661 --> 00:58:04.818
LAURA: Indeed.

00:58:04.818 --> 00:58:06.181
LIAM: How big is that log book?

00:58:07.768 --> 00:58:10.098
MATT: From what you see, it's maybe about 50 pages.

00:58:10.098 --> 00:58:10.931
LIAM: I take it.

00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:11.764
MATT: Okay.

00:58:13.608 --> 00:58:16.541
"Perhaps, if we survive this,

00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:18.411
"we can return and--"

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:22.178
LAURA: And change the past?

00:58:22.178 --> 00:58:24.281
MATT: "Exchange theories."

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:28.018
LAURA: (whispering) Does that mean what I think it means?

00:58:28.018 --> 00:58:29.678
Is he coming onto you?

00:58:29.678 --> 00:58:31.810
LIAM: I think: What do you think it means?

00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:34.393
LAURA: I think he's coming onto you.

00:58:38.108 --> 00:58:40.406
LIAM: She hears: It's complicated.

00:58:40.406 --> 00:58:42.406
LAURA: (gasps)

00:58:44.368 --> 00:58:48.284
LIAM: Well, we have a task at hand here, <i>ja</i>?

00:58:49.498 --> 00:58:51.189
I pick up a little bit of--

00:58:53.606 --> 00:58:56.085
a small piece of rubble from the room,

00:58:56.085 --> 00:58:58.458
and add it to my waypoints.

00:58:58.458 --> 00:58:59.768
MATT: Okay.

00:58:59.768 --> 00:59:02.538
LAURA: By the way, speaking of small piece of rubble,

00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:04.268
this is why Find the Path wouldn't work.

00:59:04.268 --> 00:59:05.771
We talked about it last time.

00:59:06.708 --> 00:59:08.938
You have to have something from the place

00:59:08.938 --> 00:59:12.058
in order to get there, which is so weird.

00:59:12.058 --> 00:59:14.828
SAM: You can't just be familiar with it?

00:59:14.828 --> 00:59:17.553
LAURA: No, you have to have an item from that location.

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.934
TRAVIS: You got to earn that HUD point.

00:59:18.934 --> 00:59:19.948
SAM: Maybe-- do we have something?

00:59:19.948 --> 00:59:23.498
LAURA: But, like, if you have an item from that location--

00:59:23.498 --> 00:59:26.068
SAM: But do we have something?
LAURA: Do we have something?

00:59:26.068 --> 00:59:27.448
SAM: Maybe.

00:59:27.448 --> 00:59:29.458
LIAM: Do we have something of Lucien-- Molly's, maybe?

00:59:29.458 --> 00:59:31.221
TRAVIS: Ask your weasel.
LAURA: Does it count?

00:59:31.221 --> 00:59:32.788
MATT: It's right about this time, Fjord.

00:59:32.788 --> 00:59:33.878
TRAVIS: Hmm?

00:59:33.878 --> 00:59:37.008
MATT: That you hear--
TRAVIS: (radar beeping)

00:59:37.008 --> 00:59:39.608
MATT: From the direction of where you had traveled from,

00:59:40.874 --> 00:59:42.957
(grunting)

00:59:44.157 --> 00:59:46.127
(water splashing)

00:59:46.127 --> 00:59:49.588
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
MARISHA: Shit, we got to go.

00:59:49.588 --> 00:59:50.868
TRAVIS: (quietly) Can you send a message?

00:59:50.868 --> 00:59:51.848
SAM: Yep.

00:59:51.848 --> 00:59:54.718
I do so. I pick out the wire

00:59:54.718 --> 00:59:57.885
and I will send a message to Capeleb.

00:59:58.855 --> 01:00:00.088
LIAM: (grunts)

01:00:00.088 --> 01:00:02.688
SAM: Saying: Hey, don't come out.

01:00:02.688 --> 01:00:06.058
There is a monster, and it is coming toward us,

01:00:06.058 --> 01:00:07.658
so don't come out of the closet.

01:00:09.498 --> 01:00:11.418
LIAM: Uh?

01:00:11.418 --> 01:00:12.278
That's what I say back.

01:00:12.278 --> 01:00:13.111
MATT: Okay.

01:00:14.368 --> 01:00:17.553
SAM: You can groan-reply to this message.

01:00:17.553 --> 01:00:18.598
LAURA: Oh no.

01:00:18.598 --> 01:00:20.098
SAM: So are we the only two in the hallway?

01:00:20.098 --> 01:00:21.656
TRAVIS: Yeah, correct.
SAM: Or was Caduceus out there, too?

01:00:21.656 --> 01:00:22.489
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, sorry.

01:00:22.489 --> 01:00:24.098
MATT: Caduceus was in the hallway between them.

01:00:24.098 --> 01:00:25.428
You guys were out

01:00:25.428 --> 01:00:26.918
towards the central hallway.

01:00:26.918 --> 01:00:27.751
SAM: And then where's Beau?

01:00:27.751 --> 01:00:29.628
MARISHA: Which means I'm still

01:00:29.628 --> 01:00:31.218
right in between the door and the hall.

01:00:31.218 --> 01:00:32.548
I'm in between two parties.

01:00:32.548 --> 01:00:34.295
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Again.

01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:35.948
SAM: You're in the splash zone,

01:00:35.948 --> 01:00:37.885
like, it's going to get to you first, right?

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:38.718
ALL: No.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:40.158
MATT: No, it would get to you both first.

01:00:40.158 --> 01:00:41.457
SAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: We're the farthest away.

01:00:41.457 --> 01:00:42.698
MARISHA: Then me, then them.
TRAVIS: Like, 25 yards

01:00:42.698 --> 01:00:43.538
from everybody else.

01:00:43.538 --> 01:00:44.379
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:00:44.379 --> 01:00:45.529
TRAVIS: Feet, sorry.

01:00:45.529 --> 01:00:47.458
MARISHA: I could probably see them, right?

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:48.758
They're just down the hall a bit?
MATT: Yeah.

01:00:48.758 --> 01:00:49.848
MARISHA: So I can see you,

01:00:49.848 --> 01:00:50.918
I'm just not with you.
MATT: 30, 35 feet

01:00:50.918 --> 01:00:51.751
from you at the most.

01:00:51.751 --> 01:00:53.988
TRAVIS: We can try and move backwards.

01:00:53.988 --> 01:00:54.829
LIAM: Face feels hot.
MARISHA: Warm?

01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:56.363
TRAVIS: We'll back up, we'll back up.

01:00:56.363 --> 01:00:57.679
SAM: But it'll follow us,

01:00:57.679 --> 01:00:58.804
and that'll lead it to our--

01:00:58.804 --> 01:01:00.420
TRAVIS: It's coming this way anyway.

01:01:02.172 --> 01:01:03.870
SAM: Should we set a trap?

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:04.703
TRAVIS: Do you have a trap?

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:05.543
SAM: I have a bomb.

01:01:09.319 --> 01:01:10.528
TRAVIS: Fluffernutter?

01:01:10.528 --> 01:01:12.008
SAM: That's loud, though.

01:01:12.008 --> 01:01:13.540
If it hunts in packs.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:16.247
MARISHA: Very loud.

01:01:16.247 --> 01:01:17.978
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true. (laughs)

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:19.698
Let's just back up.

01:01:19.698 --> 01:01:20.838
MATT: All right, have both of you

01:01:20.838 --> 01:01:22.416
roll stealth checks for me.
SAM: Marine Layer?

01:01:22.416 --> 01:01:26.172
TRAVIS: I want to, but it fucks me every time.

01:01:26.172 --> 01:01:28.028
LAURA: Can you use, like, Control Water,

01:01:28.028 --> 01:01:28.861
and shove it off to them?

01:01:28.861 --> 01:01:30.927
SAM: Oh, make your ice wall!

01:01:30.927 --> 01:01:32.084
LAURA: Or just make it a tidal wave

01:01:32.084 --> 01:01:33.968
that forces it off the side.

01:01:33.968 --> 01:01:35.558
TRAVIS: It's two inches of water.

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:37.148
LAURA: So what? You can control the water.

01:01:37.148 --> 01:01:37.981
Make it a bigger wave.

01:01:37.981 --> 01:01:39.425
TRAVIS: We experienced this with Keyleth,

01:01:39.425 --> 01:01:43.103
and that is not going to knock anything out of the aqueduct.

01:01:43.103 --> 01:01:44.558
It'll be like, (splash).

01:01:44.558 --> 01:01:46.631
LIAM: What a callback.

01:01:46.631 --> 01:01:47.768
MARISHA: It's true.

01:01:47.768 --> 01:01:48.975
TRAVIS: I learned.
MARISHA: He has a point.

01:01:48.975 --> 01:01:50.866
TRAVIS: Tidal Wave against Thordak, wasn't it?

01:01:50.866 --> 01:01:53.113
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought it was going to be really cool,

01:01:53.113 --> 01:01:54.238
and it wasn't, yeah.

01:01:54.238 --> 01:01:56.036
SAM: I can turn five--

01:01:56.036 --> 01:01:58.894
I can turn a five-square-foot

01:01:58.894 --> 01:02:01.230
part of the water slightly warmer.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:02.608
(laughter)

01:02:02.608 --> 01:02:04.428
ASHLEY: By peeing?
LIAM: It's like peeing, that's it.

01:02:04.428 --> 01:02:06.438
SAM: No, it's a spell,

01:02:06.438 --> 01:02:08.625
or I could pee, that would be faster, actually.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:09.588
MATT: You got options.

01:02:09.588 --> 01:02:12.968
MARISHA: To be fair, Thordak was fucking massive.

01:02:12.968 --> 01:02:14.017
TRAVIS: He was, he was.

01:02:14.017 --> 01:02:14.850
MARISHA: Fucking massive.

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:17.479
ASHLEY: Can you hide behind in the door?

01:02:17.479 --> 01:02:19.029
SAM: We're going to slowly back up,

01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:20.499
back towards where we were.

01:02:20.499 --> 01:02:23.129
MATT: Okay, whoever's backing up,

01:02:23.129 --> 01:02:25.789
which currently right now would be just you two?

01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:27.712
Go ahead and make stealth checks, please.

01:02:29.019 --> 01:02:29.852
LAURA: Oh god!

01:02:31.579 --> 01:02:33.178
TRAVIS: 17.
SAM: 26.

01:02:33.178 --> 01:02:34.669
MATT: 26.

01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:37.702
You both quietly back up to where the rest of the group is.

01:02:39.978 --> 01:02:44.098
You can just faintly hear the (breathes heavily),

01:02:44.098 --> 01:02:46.169
but it's not becoming any louder.

01:02:46.169 --> 01:02:48.899
SAM: Should we duck into the room?

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:50.449
TRAVIS: I'd just stay, no movement.

01:02:50.449 --> 01:02:51.669
SAM: But what if it comes? It'll see us.

01:02:51.669 --> 01:02:52.678
We should duck in the room

01:02:52.678 --> 01:02:54.739
so that it'll just walk on by.

01:02:54.739 --> 01:02:57.199
TRAVIS: If it comes in the room, then we're fucked.

01:02:57.199 --> 01:03:00.069
SAM: But we'll be in the room, we can shoot out of it.

01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:03.119
Or we can disguise the gap

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:04.419
in the door.
TRAVIS: Sure, let's go--

01:03:04.419 --> 01:03:05.762
Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.289
SAM: Guys, hey, there's a creature!

01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:09.614
MARISHA: What?
SAM: There's a creature.

01:03:09.614 --> 01:03:11.836
MARISHA: Oh, we should probably
just duck in this door, then.

01:03:11.836 --> 01:03:12.669
SAM: That's what I said.

01:03:12.669 --> 01:03:14.059
MARISHA: Right, yeah, let's do that.

01:03:14.059 --> 01:03:15.481
SAM: Okay, let's duck in.

01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:17.159
Caduceus, are you here?

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:18.709
Okay, cool. (laughs)

01:03:18.709 --> 01:03:21.625
TRAVIS: I definitely have
extinguished the sword and everything.

01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:22.689
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: If we do go

01:03:22.689 --> 01:03:24.792
in the room, I'll say: Caleb, lights out.

01:03:25.688 --> 01:03:26.521
LIAM: I don't have any lights on.

01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:27.596
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought you had a ball.

01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:28.546
LIAM: I see in the dark now.

01:03:28.546 --> 01:03:29.705
TRAVIS: Oh, fine, you fucker!

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.094
SAM: We can probably see in the dark, too.

01:03:31.094 --> 01:03:33.572
Can we-- Marine Layer!

01:03:33.572 --> 01:03:35.069
TRAVIS: No!

01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:37.408
SAM: So that if it looks in, it can't see anything.

01:03:37.408 --> 01:03:39.248
TRAVIS: Fuck you!
LAURA: Shut up!

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:40.348
We've gotten in trouble before

01:03:40.348 --> 01:03:42.348
with you being too loud!

01:03:44.113 --> 01:03:46.079
SAM: I'm just saying, Marine Layer.

01:03:46.079 --> 01:03:47.502
It's the one thing!

01:03:49.469 --> 01:03:51.208
Or we can put up a fake door.

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:52.914
I have-- I have an illusion.

01:03:52.914 --> 01:03:54.019
LAURA: Then do it!

01:03:54.019 --> 01:03:56.996
Why don't you set a noise out behind it

01:03:56.996 --> 01:03:58.928
so it chases off in the other direction?

01:03:58.928 --> 01:04:01.059
TRAVIS: I have it.
SAM: Oh, I can just throw something.

01:04:01.059 --> 01:04:02.089
LAURA: Oh, that'll work!

01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:04.308
MARISHA: I just slowly go--
SAM: I cast Mage Hand--

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:06.609
MARISHA: And close the door.

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:08.398
TRAVIS: No, it's all rusted, it'll be loud!

01:04:08.398 --> 01:04:09.549
MARISHA: Oh, is it loud?
LAURA: It's a thing.

01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:11.269
MATT: Make a strength check.
TRAVIS: Goddamn it!

01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:12.449
LIAM: Oh, it's a Star Trek door?
MARISHA: I'm not going to do that

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.859
LAURA: It's a Star Trek door.
(hisses)

01:04:14.859 --> 01:04:16.561
MARISHA: I thought it was just a hanging door.

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:17.849
MATT: No, no.
TRAVIS: Remember it was like-- (squeak)

01:04:17.849 --> 01:04:19.789
MATT: It slid into the doorway.

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.399
MARISHA: No.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:22.669
MATT: Partway.
SAM: With Mage Hand, I can

01:04:22.669 --> 01:04:23.899
just throw something down the hall?

01:04:23.899 --> 01:04:24.809
LAURA: Yeah!
TRAVIS: Just do it!

01:04:24.809 --> 01:04:27.329
LAURA: Throw something off of
the waterfall, but make it make a noise!

01:04:27.329 --> 01:04:28.209
SAM: Give me something!

01:04:28.209 --> 01:04:29.559
TALIESIN: We're nowhere near that,

01:04:29.559 --> 01:04:31.649
you'd have to go all the way round.

01:04:31.649 --> 01:04:33.229
TRAVIS: Give her your staff!
LAURA: No, no, no!

01:04:33.229 --> 01:04:38.229
Take one of the-- it's one of those disco sticks.

01:04:38.439 --> 01:04:40.799
It's a rave stick, make the Mage Hand light it up

01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:42.459
and then, after it passes by.

01:04:42.459 --> 01:04:43.733
MARISHA: Yasha?
ASHLEY: Yeah?

01:04:43.733 --> 01:04:44.958
MARISHA: Your hair looks really great.

01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:46.099
SAM: I'll send the Mage Hand out--

01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:47.579
MARISHA: Yeah, humidity in here, I think it's--

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:49.719
SAM: 60 feet, 59 feet away.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:50.819
MATT: Okay.

01:04:50.819 --> 01:04:52.429
SAM: Down the hall, past.

01:04:52.429 --> 01:04:54.257
LAURA: No, past us? No!
SAM: I don't know!

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:57.310
LAURA: Make it go back over the waterfall!

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:00.719
SAM: Okay. I'm sending it back.

01:05:00.719 --> 01:05:02.980
But I'm not breaking the rave stick yet.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:03.909
I'm just holding it.

01:05:03.909 --> 01:05:07.739
MATT: Okay, so the Mage Hand just drifts into the darkness.

01:05:07.739 --> 01:05:08.709
What's your--
SAM: Oh,

01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:10.435
it can only go 30 feet, shit!

01:05:10.435 --> 01:05:12.029
(laughter)

01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:13.469
MATT: So as you drift it out into the middle

01:05:13.469 --> 01:05:16.649
of the dark shadowed hall where you all came from,

01:05:16.649 --> 01:05:18.872
it just floats there 30 feet from you.

01:05:18.872 --> 01:05:20.249
(laughter)

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.583
LIAM: Just a beacon.
MARISHA: Yep! (laughs)

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:23.619
SAM: Put it right on the side

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.831
or down in the water, down in the water!

01:05:25.831 --> 01:05:28.389
MATT: The water begins to break--
LIAM: The water's going--

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:30.462
MATT: -- over it.
LIAM: (rave noises)

01:05:30.462 --> 01:05:32.829
SAM: Up on the ceiling, up on the ceiling!

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:34.844
MATT: It's not lit yet, thankfully.

01:05:34.844 --> 01:05:37.093
(laughs)

01:05:37.093 --> 01:05:38.692
ASHLEY: (laughs)

01:05:38.692 --> 01:05:39.808
The water!

01:05:42.346 --> 01:05:43.772
SAM: Okay, it's just waiting, just in case.

01:05:43.772 --> 01:05:46.122
TALIESIN: This is the worst case of we have to do something.

01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:48.609
LIAM: Could the water carry it, though?

01:05:48.609 --> 01:05:49.939
If you lit it would it--?

01:05:49.939 --> 01:05:52.597
SAM: Oh, it could!
LAURA: Send my duplicate!

01:05:52.597 --> 01:05:53.430
SAM: Yeah!
LAURA: Wait, wait,

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:54.459
why are we doing this?

01:05:54.459 --> 01:05:56.489
That can go way farther!

01:05:56.489 --> 01:05:58.497
TRAVIS: What happened to just throwing something?

01:05:58.497 --> 01:06:00.529
Just throw something past it!

01:06:00.529 --> 01:06:01.679
SAM: Okay, I'll just throw it,

01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:03.340
I'm throwing back the other way?

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.449
LAURA: No, you're throwing it over the waterfall!

01:06:05.449 --> 01:06:06.896
LIAM: He's behind me, isn't he?

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:08.859
(laughter)

01:06:08.859 --> 01:06:11.706
ASHLEY: In the deep dark hole so they jump off.

01:06:11.706 --> 01:06:13.709
SAM: Okay. I'm going to throw it over the waterfall

01:06:13.709 --> 01:06:14.916
if I can reach that far.

01:06:14.916 --> 01:06:16.006
LAURA: But light it up!

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:17.559
MATT: Mage Hand does not have much strength

01:06:17.559 --> 01:06:19.079
to throw something, but you can throw it yourself

01:06:19.079 --> 01:06:19.912
if you'd like.

01:06:19.912 --> 01:06:20.851
SAM: Okay, I'll go out the door.

01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:22.101
LAURA: No, no, no!

01:06:23.616 --> 01:06:25.011
SAM: How am I going to throw it over

01:06:25.011 --> 01:06:26.569
if I can't go out there to throw it?!

01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:29.689
LIAM: This is like if we, us, not the characters,

01:06:29.689 --> 01:06:32.219
<i>us</i> were trying to save the world.

01:06:32.219 --> 01:06:35.009
MARISHA: How have we ran a company successfully

01:06:35.919 --> 01:06:37.729
for the past how many--? (laughs)

01:06:37.729 --> 01:06:39.285
TALIESIN: Pure luck.

01:06:39.285 --> 01:06:41.467
SAM: Wait, I've got a crossbow!

01:06:41.467 --> 01:06:43.489
LIAM: We have our plusses.
SAM: I can just shoot it.

01:06:43.489 --> 01:06:44.447
LAURA: Yeah, do that!

01:06:44.447 --> 01:06:46.516
TALIESIN: Don't, oh--
ASHLEY: Shoot the rave stick?

01:06:46.516 --> 01:06:49.777
LAURA: No, to shoot the rave stick over the side.

01:06:49.777 --> 01:06:52.268
SAM: Okay, Mage Hand's coming back.
TALIESIN: Am I the only one who knows

01:06:52.268 --> 01:06:53.944
that we can't see the waterfall at all right now?

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:54.777
MATT: Correct.

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.439
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm the one who-- okay, that's good.

01:06:56.439 --> 01:06:57.486
SAM: Can we see the waterfall?

01:06:57.486 --> 01:07:00.929
TALIESIN: No! We're three corners around!

01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:01.762
TRAVIS: Yeah, it curved, right?

01:07:01.762 --> 01:07:04.429
MATT: From the main hallway, the hallway continues

01:07:04.429 --> 01:07:06.089
down the steps, descending to the main chamber.

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:07.239
You can see into the chamber

01:07:07.239 --> 01:07:08.839
when you're in the main hallway.

01:07:09.719 --> 01:07:12.699
But you do not have enough visual range

01:07:12.699 --> 01:07:14.039
to see the actual waterfall.

01:07:14.039 --> 01:07:15.449
TALIESIN: It would only call them to us.

01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:18.489
SAM: I do this when I shoot, it curves, right?

01:07:18.489 --> 01:07:19.799
MATT: Right, right, yeah.
SAM: Is that how that works?

01:07:19.799 --> 01:07:21.284
MATT: Yes, the bullets.
TRAVIS: Maybe we just wait

01:07:21.284 --> 01:07:22.117
and see what it does.

01:07:22.117 --> 01:07:25.009
LAURA: Or maybe we just walk out and walk away.

01:07:25.009 --> 01:07:26.089
MARISHA: Why don't we just walk away?

01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:29.444
We could have been a mile from it from now!

01:07:29.444 --> 01:07:30.722
LAURA: Let's just keep walking away from it.

01:07:30.722 --> 01:07:31.762
TRAVIS: Because we'd have to make stealth checks.

01:07:31.762 --> 01:07:34.177
LAURA: Okay, I'll cast Pass Without a Trace and let's go!

01:07:34.177 --> 01:07:35.234
MARISHA: Okay!
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:07:35.234 --> 01:07:36.734
LAURA: Okay. Bye, guys!

01:07:37.919 --> 01:07:38.869
MATT: So is that the plan?

01:07:38.869 --> 01:07:40.215
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Holy crap.

01:07:40.215 --> 01:07:41.479
(laughter)

01:07:41.479 --> 01:07:44.181
SAM: We're just going to slowly walk away?

01:07:44.181 --> 01:07:46.169
ASHLEY: Yeah, but now they're even closer, probably.

01:07:46.169 --> 01:07:47.149
LIAM: Worse!

01:07:47.149 --> 01:07:48.507
Yes, we took three minutes

01:07:48.507 --> 01:07:50.319
to achieve nothing.
SAM: But we could block the way

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:51.927
with Marine Layer!

01:07:51.927 --> 01:07:53.304
TRAVIS: (screams) No!

01:07:53.304 --> 01:07:58.304
(laughter)

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:02.334
You'll just see-- (hisses)
and then you'll hear-- (footsteps).

01:08:02.334 --> 01:08:04.481
Drop it, drop it, drop it!

01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:06.956
(laughter)

01:08:06.956 --> 01:08:08.219
MATT: So what's the plan?

01:08:08.219 --> 01:08:09.832
SAM: We're just going to walk?

01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:11.754
TRAVIS: Yes.
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:12.587
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: Pass Without a Trace.

01:08:12.587 --> 01:08:14.229
ASHLEY: We don't need anything else in here?

01:08:14.229 --> 01:08:15.279
This is good? We're good.

01:08:15.279 --> 01:08:16.149
LAURA: We're good.

01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:18.259
I'm going to cast-- okay, here's the thing.

01:08:18.259 --> 01:08:19.609
Here's what's going to happen.

01:08:19.609 --> 01:08:22.209
That's a concentration, I can't do Pass Without a Trace

01:08:22.209 --> 01:08:25.089
and Invoke Duplicity, so it's either or.

01:08:25.089 --> 01:08:26.559
TALIESIN: I think it's Pass Without a Trace.

01:08:26.559 --> 01:08:28.494
LAURA: Okay, Pass Without a Trace.

01:08:28.494 --> 01:08:29.779
Everybody!

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:31.169
MATT: All right, everyone make a stealth check, please.

01:08:31.169 --> 01:08:32.772
TRAVIS: How long does it last for?

01:08:32.772 --> 01:08:33.859
LAURA: I don't know!

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:36.169
MARISHA: Like an hour, right?
TALIESIN: Do we want to leave a rave stick in the room?

01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:39.049
LIAM: Plus 10, right?
LAURA: Yeah, it's a plus 10, and,

01:08:39.049 --> 01:08:40.609
who needs it, Blessing of the Trickster?

01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:42.492
Who's the worst?
LIAM: What is it?

01:08:42.492 --> 01:08:44.339
MARISHA: I'm pretty bad.
LIAM: Mine's not great.

01:08:44.339 --> 01:08:46.989
SAM: Blessing of the Sprinkle?
MARISHA: I have a higher base,

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:48.789
I'll be 23 in total.

01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:49.994
LIAM: I'm much lower than that.

01:08:49.994 --> 01:08:51.879
LAURA: Cast Blessing of the Trickster.

01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:52.779
LIAM: What's that, advantage?

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:53.612
LAURA: Yes.

01:08:54.739 --> 01:08:56.510
LIAM: Better. Not much better.

01:08:57.629 --> 01:08:58.512
TRAVIS: 23.

01:08:58.512 --> 01:09:00.139
LIAM: Oh, it is better, yeah.

01:09:00.139 --> 01:09:01.569
MATT: Essek got a 30.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.079
LAURA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:09:03.079 --> 01:09:05.162
He'd better, he fucking floats.
LAURA: Jester got a 30 as well!

01:09:05.162 --> 01:09:06.199
MATT: Nice.

01:09:06.199 --> 01:09:08.931
LIAM: 24, thanks to Blessing of the Trickster.

01:09:08.931 --> 01:09:10.014
SAM: 39.

01:09:10.014 --> 01:09:11.034
ASHLEY: 24.

01:09:11.034 --> 01:09:12.174
TALIESIN: 30.

01:09:12.174 --> 01:09:13.469
MARISHA: 23.

01:09:13.469 --> 01:09:15.039
MATT: That's some great rolls.
LAURA: Nice.

01:09:15.039 --> 01:09:17.889
MATT: As you all-- and it is one at a time

01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:21.339
squeezing through the doorway into the hallway,

01:09:21.339 --> 01:09:24.979
each of you can make out the-- (animal grunting)

01:09:24.979 --> 01:09:28.302
and with that proximity, you recognize the sounds.

01:09:29.529 --> 01:09:32.849
Those larger, furless, skinless-looking

01:09:32.849 --> 01:09:36.562
bear-like creatures that you had fought not long ago.

01:09:37.589 --> 01:09:41.209
There's one maybe about 15 feet

01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:44.049
beyond the hallway that you're standing in,

01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:46.089
15 feet from where the stairs ascend

01:09:46.089 --> 01:09:48.219
just stalking around,

01:09:48.219 --> 01:09:49.849
but it doesn't seem to take note of you

01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:52.769
as one by one, you all begin to enter the hallway.

01:09:52.769 --> 01:09:55.099
Hear it, see it, and back up

01:09:55.099 --> 01:09:56.459
further into the hall

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.779
where you guys were heading towards.

01:09:58.779 --> 01:09:59.989
LIAM: We haven't reached that point yet,

01:09:59.989 --> 01:10:01.791
and it is where we were initially?

01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:03.624
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Thank you.

01:10:05.389 --> 01:10:08.714
MATT: So what's the marching order now?

01:10:10.077 --> 01:10:11.439
Same?
TRAVIS: Same, I think.

01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:12.955
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: That works.

01:10:12.955 --> 01:10:13.876
MATT: All right.
LAURA: But are we having to go

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.709
one at a time or is it--?

01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:17.779
MATT: No, you're back into the wider hallway.

01:10:17.779 --> 01:10:18.612
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

01:10:18.612 --> 01:10:21.082
LIAM: I'll actually stay near the rear this time.

01:10:22.039 --> 01:10:23.197
MATT: Okay.

01:10:25.383 --> 01:10:27.309
LIAM: In case I need to fill the hallway with death.

01:10:27.309 --> 01:10:28.742
TALIESIN: Those bears don't have,

01:10:30.729 --> 01:10:33.129
projectile, any magic or anything like that?

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:34.187
LIAM: The Care Bears? Sure they do.

01:10:34.187 --> 01:10:35.829
TALIESIN: They do, okay.

01:10:35.829 --> 01:10:37.459
MATT: These ones do not, you don't recall.

01:10:37.459 --> 01:10:38.819
LIAM: I was talking about the Care Bears.

01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:39.652
MATT: Oh, the Care Bears, yes.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:40.809
LIAM: Yeah, it comes out of their tummy.

01:10:40.809 --> 01:10:43.872
MATT: Yeah, they do. The Stare.
TALIESIN: Anti-magic Stare.

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:47.670
MATT: Powerful and comes back on a five or six every turn.

01:10:48.599 --> 01:10:49.598
All righty.

01:10:49.598 --> 01:10:51.127
TALIESIN: (laughs)

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:55.562
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to hand an oops-stone to Caleb.

01:10:56.549 --> 01:10:57.959
You can--
LIAM: The stinky one?

01:10:57.959 --> 01:11:00.039
LAURA: Yeah, you can drop it at the back of the pack.

01:11:00.039 --> 01:11:00.872
LIAM: Oh, that's a good idea.

01:11:00.872 --> 01:11:02.359
LAURA: It'll keep people-- hopefully they won't

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:04.399
want to enter the area for at least 10 minutes.

01:11:04.399 --> 01:11:05.659
LIAM: Yeah, if they have a really good smell

01:11:05.659 --> 01:11:07.569
then this is maybe especially potent.

01:11:07.569 --> 01:11:08.619
LAURA: Yeah.

01:11:08.619 --> 01:11:09.679
LIAM: Thank you, I think.

01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:11.639
SAM: Do you need your rave stick back, or--?

01:11:11.639 --> 01:11:14.445
LAURA: I've got so many rave sticks, don't you worry.

01:11:14.445 --> 01:11:15.379
SAM: Okay.

01:11:15.379 --> 01:11:17.783
MATT: Actually, I checked on your inventory

01:11:17.783 --> 01:11:19.119
and it's like, celebone, celebone, celebone,

01:11:19.119 --> 01:11:20.599
celebone, celebone, celebone.
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:11:20.599 --> 01:11:23.759
MATT: It's like, ha ha, that's right!
LAURA: 20 oops-stones, 20 celebones.

01:11:23.759 --> 01:11:25.859
Shit ton of chuckle dust, I'm good.

01:11:25.859 --> 01:11:26.769
MATT: The important stuff.

01:11:26.769 --> 01:11:28.579
LIAM: All your Skyrim wheels of cheese?

01:11:28.579 --> 01:11:30.449
LAURA: Yes.

01:11:30.449 --> 01:11:32.092
TALIESIN: Trying to make some money at the rave.

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:34.129
MATT: Indeed.
TALIESIN: Glow stick, glow stick?

01:11:34.129 --> 01:11:35.332
MATT: All righty, so.

01:11:36.519 --> 01:11:38.659
Backing up and heading towards

01:11:38.659 --> 01:11:40.959
the rest of the left turn

01:11:40.959 --> 01:11:43.332
that's heading southward in the hall.

01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:47.154
It continues on for another 30 or so feet,

01:11:47.154 --> 01:11:48.929
but you can see now there are statues

01:11:48.929 --> 01:11:51.039
set on each side of the chamber,

01:11:51.039 --> 01:11:52.839
though some of them have fallen and broken

01:11:52.839 --> 01:11:56.019
and a lot of whatever remnants

01:11:56.019 --> 01:11:58.629
and broken chunks that may have been set free

01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:59.999
have since long washed away

01:11:59.999 --> 01:12:01.932
and you can see the same...

01:12:03.766 --> 01:12:06.432
darkening, elemental gathering

01:12:06.432 --> 01:12:07.569
where the water has been touching it

01:12:07.569 --> 01:12:09.619
for some time as the water continues to rush.

01:12:09.619 --> 01:12:11.889
And the hall is a very, very faint side angle

01:12:11.889 --> 01:12:14.409
and you can see the level's a little bit uneven

01:12:14.409 --> 01:12:15.999
from where you're standing.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:20.239
There is an open hall to the right

01:12:20.239 --> 01:12:25.239
and a partially ajar door

01:12:25.449 --> 01:12:27.029
across where the hallway ends

01:12:27.029 --> 01:12:28.379
about 30 feet ahead of you.

01:12:31.399 --> 01:12:33.799
MARISHA: So another offshoot door, essentially?

01:12:33.799 --> 01:12:34.819
MATT: There's an open archway.

01:12:34.819 --> 01:12:36.519
LIAM: A new door and a new passageway.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.159
MATT: Another hallway that goes this way.

01:12:38.159 --> 01:12:40.779
And then a door ahead that is partially open.

01:12:40.779 --> 01:12:42.479
LAURA: Okay.

01:12:42.479 --> 01:12:44.212
TRAVIS: Got to check the partially open.
SAM: Well, let's go look in the door, right?

01:12:44.212 --> 01:12:45.095
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Got to.

01:12:45.095 --> 01:12:47.019
MARISHA: Once again, any writing above it?

01:12:47.019 --> 01:12:50.319
Any boopies?
MATT: Writing above both,

01:12:50.319 --> 01:12:52.309
the archway that leads into the hall to the right

01:12:52.309 --> 01:12:54.396
and writing in the kitchen above.

01:12:54.396 --> 01:12:55.429
SAM: What's it say?

01:12:55.429 --> 01:12:56.969
LIAM: Comprehend Languages is still up.

01:12:56.969 --> 01:12:58.377
MATT: Indeed.

01:12:59.439 --> 01:13:01.389
Across from you where the partially open door,

01:13:01.389 --> 01:13:04.366
you do see it says "Kitchen."

01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:10.559
And the hall to the right says "Common Area."

01:13:10.559 --> 01:13:12.799
TRAVIS: And the water flow's coming from the common area?

01:13:12.799 --> 01:13:14.019
MATT: Correct.

01:13:14.019 --> 01:13:15.319
TALIESIN: You'd think the kitchen.

01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:19.271
MARISHA: Someone left the sink on?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:13:19.271 --> 01:13:22.950
TRAVIS: Any difference in the ceiling or the water level?

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:24.349
TALIESIN: That's going to be expensive.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:13:24.349 --> 01:13:25.949
LIAM: I'm just going to rinse these Brussels sprouts,

01:13:25.949 --> 01:13:27.532
I'll be right back!

01:13:27.532 --> 01:13:28.809
(laughter)

01:13:28.809 --> 01:13:30.519
MATT: The water level, no, but you do see

01:13:30.519 --> 01:13:33.859
the water is rushing from that area

01:13:33.859 --> 01:13:35.449
into this tunnel and is now spreading

01:13:35.449 --> 01:13:37.909
amongst both sides, but appears to mostly

01:13:37.909 --> 01:13:40.789
be flowing in the direction from where you traveled.

01:13:40.789 --> 01:13:42.599
TRAVIS: And is the ceiling in this area changed

01:13:42.599 --> 01:13:44.469
or opened up or gotten higher or anything?

01:13:44.469 --> 01:13:46.229
MATT: No, it's a continuation of the previous hall.

01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:47.062
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:13:48.729 --> 01:13:50.652
LAURA: We need to keep moving.
TRAVIS: Half open door.

01:13:50.652 --> 01:13:51.959
LIAM: Just in case.

01:13:51.959 --> 01:13:56.433
TALIESIN: I'll admit the common area does sound interesting.

01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:57.658
LAURA: That's where the water's coming from.

01:13:57.658 --> 01:13:58.932
MARISHA and LIAM: That's where we're going.

01:13:58.932 --> 01:14:01.497
MARISHA: But peek in the kitchen first, I guess?

01:14:01.497 --> 01:14:02.332
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:14:02.332 --> 01:14:03.482
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Just a couple of peeks.

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:04.929
LIAM: See some 2000 year-old food.

01:14:04.929 --> 01:14:06.379
MATT: Who's peeking in first?

01:14:06.379 --> 01:14:07.889
LAURA: Beau.
MARISHA: I'll peek in.

01:14:07.889 --> 01:14:09.852
MATT: All right, Beauregard, make a perception check.

01:14:11.069 --> 01:14:13.419
LAURA: I'm going to pat her back and give you Guidance!

01:14:13.419 --> 01:14:14.572
MARISHA: I'll take it!

01:14:15.729 --> 01:14:16.746
Oh, thanks, Jess.

01:14:18.689 --> 01:14:20.959
18, that was--

01:14:20.959 --> 01:14:21.952
MATT: 18, slick.

01:14:22.879 --> 01:14:24.609
Okay, glancing inside, you see--

01:14:24.609 --> 01:14:26.109
MARISHA: Wait, Guidance is advantage, right?

01:14:26.109 --> 01:14:26.942
MATT: No, Guidance is a 1d4.

01:14:26.942 --> 01:14:29.169
MARISHA: Add a d4, thank you, thank you.

01:14:29.169 --> 01:14:30.477
LAURA: You did it right?
MARISHA: I did it right.

01:14:30.477 --> 01:14:31.310
MATT: Okay.

01:14:33.079 --> 01:14:37.059
An absolutely ruined, smallish kitchen

01:14:37.059 --> 01:14:41.279
lies still with counters and stove-like installations

01:14:41.279 --> 01:14:43.249
that are overturned and broken.

01:14:43.249 --> 01:14:45.969
You see hundreds of shards of fine dishware

01:14:45.969 --> 01:14:49.239
and broken ceramic materials

01:14:49.239 --> 01:14:51.619
just scattered along the floor and piled up

01:14:51.619 --> 01:14:54.029
to where the water only comes to a certain point.

01:14:54.029 --> 01:14:57.139
It seems like the angle that this hall is at,

01:14:57.139 --> 01:14:59.779
the water only gets to a certain,

01:14:59.779 --> 01:15:01.199
maybe three or four feet into the entryway

01:15:01.199 --> 01:15:03.089
before some of the rubble closes it off,

01:15:03.089 --> 01:15:05.289
or the angle doesn't carry it any higher.

01:15:06.439 --> 01:15:09.652
You do see the remains of a few individuals.

01:15:11.119 --> 01:15:13.989
Heavily dismembered, long dead.

01:15:13.989 --> 01:15:14.822
TRAVIS: Dismembered?

01:15:16.019 --> 01:15:20.258
MATT: And-- you rolled-- was it 17?

01:15:20.258 --> 01:15:22.279
MARISHA: 18.
MATT: 18, yeah.

01:15:22.279 --> 01:15:26.029
You also see on the opposite corner,

01:15:26.029 --> 01:15:30.302
curled up in two various sections,

01:15:31.489 --> 01:15:35.447
these red and teal-colored

01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:37.063
panther-like beings

01:15:37.063 --> 01:15:41.799
that are in a wrapped resting state

01:15:41.799 --> 01:15:44.949
with a fleshy, muscle-like tail

01:15:44.949 --> 01:15:47.359
that ends in a singular eye.

01:15:47.359 --> 01:15:51.719
The eye phased out,

01:15:51.719 --> 01:15:53.693
twitching on occasion.

01:15:53.693 --> 01:15:55.629
TRAVIS: Marine Layer!
MATT: Glancing around.

01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:58.049
But they're both not moving,

01:15:58.049 --> 01:15:59.432
curled in on themselves.

01:16:00.879 --> 01:16:04.189
Seemingly just resting.

01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:07.922
MARISHA: I just very slowly--

01:16:09.179 --> 01:16:10.789
I don't even want to touch the door,

01:16:10.789 --> 01:16:12.122
just turn to everybody.

01:16:13.452 --> 01:16:14.937
ASHLEY: (whispering) No snacks?

01:16:16.087 --> 01:16:18.170
MARISHA: (whispering) We would be the snacks.

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:23.749
SAM: Do they have a KitchenAid in there?

01:16:23.749 --> 01:16:25.829
With a breadmaker attachment?

01:16:25.829 --> 01:16:28.499
MARISHA: It's out of commission.

01:16:28.499 --> 01:16:29.949
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:16:29.949 --> 01:16:30.843
SAM: Those are valuable.

01:16:30.843 --> 01:16:32.629
ASHLEY: I mean, if they're this good with magic,

01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:34.929
they probably have a box that you can open

01:16:34.929 --> 01:16:36.552
and it's just a full meal.

01:16:37.882 --> 01:16:40.099
Magic food.
SAM: Yeah!

01:16:40.099 --> 01:16:42.189
MARISHA: That full meal has been had.

01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:43.264
SAM and ASHLEY: Okay.

01:16:43.264 --> 01:16:44.171
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Keep going?

01:16:44.171 --> 01:16:46.119
MARISHA: Cooks have been cooked.

01:16:46.119 --> 01:16:47.659
LAURA: Common area?

01:16:47.659 --> 01:16:50.120
MARISHA: Common area, yeah.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:50.961
MATT: Okay.

01:16:50.961 --> 01:16:51.952
MARISHA: And just

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.342
back away.

01:16:55.342 --> 01:16:57.069
MATT: Okay, the same stealth checks remain.

01:16:57.069 --> 01:16:58.877
Nothing has been broken or noticed.

01:16:58.877 --> 01:16:59.710
LAURA: Great.

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:01.749
MATT: You head back and head into the hallway

01:17:01.749 --> 01:17:04.499
that leads towards what was labeled as the common area.

01:17:06.119 --> 01:17:08.639
There's only a few steps about 10 feet in

01:17:08.639 --> 01:17:11.509
that lead up, once more the water pouring down

01:17:11.509 --> 01:17:15.349
like small waterfalls before you slowly step up

01:17:15.349 --> 01:17:18.619
into a room that has light.

01:17:18.619 --> 01:17:23.559
This one has the orange-ish yellow overhead arcane orbs,

01:17:23.559 --> 01:17:25.779
though they've been long dying

01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:28.382
and left pale, some flickering,

01:17:29.289 --> 01:17:31.987
like they're just about to expire

01:17:31.987 --> 01:17:34.122
the last bit of arcana that has kept them going

01:17:34.122 --> 01:17:35.772
for the thousand years.

01:17:35.772 --> 01:17:37.998
LAURA: I mean, those things are pretty strong

01:17:37.998 --> 01:17:39.109
to last this long.

01:17:39.109 --> 01:17:40.339
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

01:17:40.339 --> 01:17:44.529
MATT: Before wizards did planned obsolescence enchanting.

01:17:44.529 --> 01:17:46.254
MARISHA: Planned obsolescence, it's real.

01:17:46.254 --> 01:17:47.181
MATT: It's a problem.

01:17:49.539 --> 01:17:52.659
But this wide room is approximately an L-shape

01:17:52.659 --> 01:17:56.829
from where you enter before it turns to the left.

01:17:56.829 --> 01:18:00.999
Inside you can see there are a handful of pillars

01:18:00.999 --> 01:18:02.509
beset to the side.

01:18:02.509 --> 01:18:04.859
The one across the way has fallen and crumpled.

01:18:04.859 --> 01:18:06.659
There is rubble everywhere.

01:18:06.659 --> 01:18:09.619
And maybe a half dozen or more

01:18:09.619 --> 01:18:12.089
tables that are overturned,

01:18:12.089 --> 01:18:15.299
some broken, some adjusted

01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:20.169
with some sort of chaotic impact of the city.

01:18:20.169 --> 01:18:22.889
Chairs and elements of what was once

01:18:22.889 --> 01:18:24.859
probably a vibrant common room

01:18:24.859 --> 01:18:27.169
and/or commissary-type chamber,

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:30.179
that is left abandoned and in disarray.

01:18:30.179 --> 01:18:33.829
There are a number of corpses here as well.

01:18:33.829 --> 01:18:37.769
The moisture not allowing the same level of mummification

01:18:37.769 --> 01:18:39.859
that other corpses have been allowed

01:18:39.859 --> 01:18:41.912
and are in a much more decayed state.

01:18:43.459 --> 01:18:44.609
Mainly just skeletal

01:18:44.609 --> 01:18:46.662
and partially blackened by proximity.

01:18:49.009 --> 01:18:51.289
You see on the opposite wall,

01:18:51.289 --> 01:18:54.799
between where the two pillars were, next to the fallen one

01:18:54.799 --> 01:18:58.219
there is another hallway that continues with,

01:18:58.219 --> 01:19:02.899
you can just barely see maybe a placard for text above it.

01:19:02.899 --> 01:19:05.509
And the L-shape of the hall continues to the left

01:19:05.509 --> 01:19:07.902
beyond where the right-hand wall goes.

01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:10.882
LIAM: One more time.

01:19:11.929 --> 01:19:13.289
The common room is shaped like an L

01:19:13.289 --> 01:19:14.626
that goes to the left when we enter?

01:19:14.626 --> 01:19:17.262
MATT: And you cannot see where the left-hand side of it is

01:19:17.262 --> 01:19:19.339
because the wall blocks the view

01:19:19.339 --> 01:19:20.172
of wherever that would go.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.019
LIAM: But we do see--

01:19:21.019 --> 01:19:22.979
MATT: You do see across the way there is an opening.

01:19:22.979 --> 01:19:25.219
LIAM: Got it, and you mentioned a placard?

01:19:25.219 --> 01:19:27.469
MATT: Yeah. Though you're too far to make out any details

01:19:27.469 --> 01:19:28.302
at the moment.
LAURA: And can we see where

01:19:28.302 --> 01:19:30.369
the water is coming from in this room?

01:19:31.579 --> 01:19:33.469
MATT: It's flowing your direction.

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:34.779
LIAM: So from around the bend?

01:19:34.779 --> 01:19:36.629
MATT: It could be. You probably have to get closer to look.

01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:37.462
TRAVIS: Let's get in there.

01:19:37.462 --> 01:19:39.769
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: We keep walking forward.

01:19:39.769 --> 01:19:42.029
LIAM: And not just the placard, I'm going to scan the room

01:19:42.029 --> 01:19:43.799
for anything written anywhere.

01:19:43.799 --> 01:19:44.682
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to scan the room

01:19:44.682 --> 01:19:45.989
for anything living.

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:47.289
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:54.059
LIAM: That is a 25.

01:19:54.059 --> 01:19:56.339
MATT: 25. Okay.

01:19:56.339 --> 01:19:58.699
Checking the wall, looking,

01:19:58.699 --> 01:20:00.752
you do see the placard ahead.

01:20:01.849 --> 01:20:04.699
You make out the text

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:07.866
"Immensus Hall" on that placard.

01:20:08.829 --> 01:20:12.589
Just as your eye peaks down towards the standing pillar

01:20:12.589 --> 01:20:16.949
in the rubble there, you see a faint pulsing glow

01:20:18.589 --> 01:20:20.699
of what you immediately recognize

01:20:20.699 --> 01:20:25.292
to be a hovering, triangular, pyramid-like device.

01:20:26.337 --> 01:20:29.211
LIAM: Oh--
MATT: (explosion)

01:20:29.211 --> 01:20:30.329
MARISHA: Glyph.

01:20:30.329 --> 01:20:33.459
MATT: I need everyone to go ahead and make a saving throw.

01:20:33.459 --> 01:20:34.935
TRAVIS: Oh!
MARISHA: Shit!

01:20:34.935 --> 01:20:38.669
TRAVIS: They gave us a taste of our own fucking medicine.

01:20:38.669 --> 01:20:40.789
We ain't in front, he is.

01:20:40.789 --> 01:20:41.702
SAM: Oh no.

01:20:42.769 --> 01:20:44.388
TRAVIS: What kind of saving throw?

01:20:44.388 --> 01:20:45.301
MATT: I'm going to look it up right now.

01:20:45.301 --> 01:20:46.734
SAM: Constitution?

01:20:46.734 --> 01:20:47.567
LAURA: Oh no.

01:20:47.567 --> 01:20:48.876
TRAVIS: Wow!
SAM: Oh no.

01:20:48.876 --> 01:20:50.001
ASHLEY: Oh.

01:20:50.999 --> 01:20:52.772
SAM: An intuit charge.

01:20:53.789 --> 01:20:55.359
MARISHA: Did it look like an intuit charge?

01:20:55.359 --> 01:20:56.669
MATT: It was an intuit charge,

01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:59.449
set for proximity detonation.

01:20:59.449 --> 01:21:00.881
Sorry, I'm pulling it up right now.

01:21:00.881 --> 01:21:02.502
TRAVIS: We're all up in that.
LIAM: Psychic damage.

01:21:02.502 --> 01:21:04.559
SAM: It says DC intelligence check.

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:07.017
MATT: Well, to check it. For the actual check.

01:21:07.017 --> 01:21:09.069
SAM: Oh that's to set it.
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw

01:21:09.069 --> 01:21:10.759
from all of you.

01:21:10.759 --> 01:21:12.104
MARISHA: Wisdom save.
TRAVIS: Man.

01:21:12.104 --> 01:21:13.354
MARISHA: And this isn't something

01:21:13.354 --> 01:21:15.369
that you can use Evasion from, Matt?

01:21:15.369 --> 01:21:16.289
MATT: No.

01:21:16.289 --> 01:21:18.259
TRAVIS: Where's my big one? Come here.

01:21:18.259 --> 01:21:19.659
MATT: Evasion is dexterity, right?

01:21:19.659 --> 01:21:20.492
MARISHA: Yes.

01:21:22.015 --> 01:21:22.848
LAURA: Did you get a natural 20?

01:21:22.848 --> 01:21:23.682
TRAVIS: Is that for real?
LIAM: No, but high.

01:21:23.682 --> 01:21:25.657
LAURA: I rolled high.
TALIESIN: I rolled high.

01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:30.229
MATT: Okay, so let me roll the damage here for a second.

01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:31.829
Hey, you guys set the precedent.

01:21:33.089 --> 01:21:34.359
MARISHA: I'm going to keep it.

01:21:34.359 --> 01:21:35.771
LIAM: Saucy DM.

01:21:35.771 --> 01:21:38.021
MATT: (chuckles)

01:21:38.919 --> 01:21:39.752
MARISHA: Actually, no.

01:21:39.752 --> 01:21:42.004
I'm going to spend a ki point to reroll this.

01:21:42.004 --> 01:21:43.509
LIAM: Get it, get it, get it, girl.

01:21:43.509 --> 01:21:45.209
MARISHA: That's better. I will take that.

01:21:49.379 --> 01:21:50.930
LAURA: No!

01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:52.849
LIAM: No!
ASHLEY: He's smiling.

01:21:52.849 --> 01:21:54.559
MARISHA: Yeah, he is.
LIAM: Oh no.

01:21:54.559 --> 01:21:55.889
LAURA: It's a lot?

01:21:55.889 --> 01:21:57.254
LIAM: Oh no, no, no.

01:21:57.254 --> 01:22:00.439
MATT: I have never rolled so many 10s.

01:22:00.439 --> 01:22:02.569
LIAM: You shut your mouth, Matthew Mercer!

01:22:02.569 --> 01:22:06.149
MATT: I feel like I have to take a picture. They're all--

01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:08.432
LIAM: You sit on a throne of lies!

01:22:08.432 --> 01:22:11.499
TALIESIN: (laughs)

01:22:14.339 --> 01:22:16.455
MATT: That would be

01:22:16.455 --> 01:22:18.438
72 points of psychic damage

01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:22.002
to anybody who didn't roll a 20 DC.

01:22:23.049 --> 01:22:24.189
TRAVIS: What happens if you roll a one?

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.599
ASHLEY: Well, yeah, I rolled a one.

01:22:26.599 --> 01:22:28.429
MATT: So you take the full damage.
ASHLEY: Did we both--?

01:22:28.429 --> 01:22:29.689
ASHLEY: I'm out.
MARISHA: You both rolled a one?

01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:30.522
ASHLEY: I'm unconscious.

01:22:30.522 --> 01:22:31.489
LAURA: You're unconscious?

01:22:31.489 --> 01:22:33.708
ASHLEY: I only had 45 hit points.
LIAM: Barbie?

01:22:33.708 --> 01:22:34.541
TRAVIS: You were down?

01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:36.109
ASHLEY: I think from the--

01:22:36.109 --> 01:22:38.366
MATT: From the previous fight.
ASHLEY: The previous fight.

01:22:38.366 --> 01:22:40.550
MARISHA: But we slept!
ASHLEY: Because-- no.

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:42.949
MARISHA: Oh, you got--
LAURA: The Genesis Ward.

01:22:42.949 --> 01:22:43.782
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:22:43.782 --> 01:22:44.615
TRAVIS: We've been walking around with--

01:22:44.615 --> 01:22:46.189
MARISHA: You got eaten.

01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:47.959
TALIESIN: That's-- I can deal with that.

01:22:47.959 --> 01:22:50.399
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:51.899
LAURA: How much damage-- is it half damage

01:22:51.899 --> 01:22:53.789
to anybody that had higher?

01:22:53.789 --> 01:22:56.389
MATT: That rolled a 20 or higher on the wisdom save.

01:22:56.389 --> 01:22:57.704
MARISHA: What's half damage on that one?

01:22:57.704 --> 01:22:58.724
30--

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.525
MATT: I just said it was 70?
LIAM: 70 something.

01:23:00.525 --> 01:23:02.399
LAURA: 72, I think.
MATT: 72 it was, yeah.

01:23:02.399 --> 01:23:03.232
LIAM: So 36.

01:23:03.232 --> 01:23:04.398
TALIESIN: 36?
MARISHA: 36.

01:23:04.398 --> 01:23:05.459
All right.
TALIESIN: Okay. Hold on.

01:23:05.459 --> 01:23:08.549
SAM: What is-- I made my save.

01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:09.948
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does other shit, though.

01:23:09.948 --> 01:23:11.882
SAM: I have Evasion?

01:23:11.882 --> 01:23:13.829
MATT: That's on dex-based, I believe, right?

01:23:13.829 --> 01:23:15.249
SAM: Yeah, you're right.
LIAM: Dex only.

01:23:15.249 --> 01:23:20.119
MATT: So 72 points of psychic damage.

01:23:20.119 --> 01:23:22.679
All of a sudden, there's a flash of white light

01:23:22.679 --> 01:23:24.189
and while you had never understood

01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:26.059
what it felt like on the receiving end,

01:23:26.059 --> 01:23:26.892
your mind is rocked with a searing white echoing pain.

01:23:26.892 --> 01:23:31.892
your mind is rocked with a searing white echoing pain.

01:23:31.899 --> 01:23:33.829
You, for a brief moment,

01:23:33.829 --> 01:23:37.119
can't even contemplate your existence.

01:23:37.119 --> 01:23:40.199
All you know is suffering.

01:23:40.199 --> 01:23:42.429
And as your body slowly begins

01:23:42.429 --> 01:23:46.545
to no longer be vibrating with absolute...

01:23:47.646 --> 01:23:48.879
desolation--

01:23:48.879 --> 01:23:50.749
everyone who failed their saving throw--

01:23:50.749 --> 01:23:51.599
LIAM: They're stunned for a minute.

01:23:51.599 --> 01:23:52.881
MATT: They're stunned for a minute

01:23:52.881 --> 01:23:56.781
and can make a save every turn to try and reject it.

01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:58.359
MARISHA: Everyone who failed?

01:23:58.359 --> 01:23:59.529
MATT: Everyone who failed.

01:23:59.529 --> 01:24:01.729
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying before anything happens.

01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:03.329
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Anybody who's down,

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:04.701
I'm just going to hit with Spare the Dying.

01:24:04.701 --> 01:24:06.170
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:09.922
LIAM: I stand over Fjord right now,

01:24:09.922 --> 01:24:13.309
looking around for an incoming attack.

01:24:13.309 --> 01:24:14.719
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Samesies.

01:24:14.719 --> 01:24:16.369
TALIESIN: I'm also now going to heal you.

01:24:19.199 --> 01:24:21.788
TRAVIS: Raise your hand if you're stunned.

01:24:21.788 --> 01:24:22.621
ASHLEY: Well--

01:24:22.621 --> 01:24:23.454
TALIESIN: Well, you're unconscious.

01:24:23.454 --> 01:24:24.767
LAURA: You're the only ones that failed it.

01:24:24.767 --> 01:24:26.433
TRAVIS: Okay.
SAM: Oh, we all made our saves!

01:24:26.433 --> 01:24:27.266
ASHLEY: Nice job.

01:24:27.266 --> 01:24:28.447
SAM: Wow.
MARISHA: Rolled a 24.

01:24:28.447 --> 01:24:29.492
MATT: DC 20 is pretty good.
LAURA: I rolled a 29.

01:24:29.492 --> 01:24:30.651
SAM: Rolled an 18.
LIAM: 25.

01:24:30.651 --> 01:24:33.042
MATT: That's crazy.
SAM: I mean, 18 plus six, so 24.

01:24:33.042 --> 01:24:34.554
MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled a 15.

01:24:37.469 --> 01:24:39.709
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 4th-level or 3rd-level,

01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:40.643
what do you think?

01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:42.135
ASHLEY: Just do third.
LAURA: Of what, Cure?

01:24:42.135 --> 01:24:43.929
ASHLEY: Just do third because--

01:24:43.929 --> 01:24:45.771
LAURA: We could take-- we're going to have to take a rest

01:24:45.771 --> 01:24:47.638
for Heroes' Feast.
MARISHA: Yes.

01:24:47.638 --> 01:24:48.959
TALIESIN: Okay.
MARISHA: You can burn some hit dice.

01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:50.589
MATT: So, Caleb, as you're glancing over you look

01:24:50.589 --> 01:24:53.126
and the other side of the L chamber--

01:24:53.126 --> 01:24:54.793
TALIESIN: You get 21 hit points.

01:24:54.793 --> 01:24:56.399
MATT: You can see a smaller doorway.

01:24:56.399 --> 01:24:58.219
And it is like a door that slides in

01:24:58.219 --> 01:24:59.509
like the previous ones, but it's a smaller one

01:24:59.509 --> 01:25:02.191
and there is a label above it that says "Brume Lift."

01:25:02.191 --> 01:25:03.647
LIAM: Brume lift? Are there umlauts?

01:25:03.647 --> 01:25:04.979
MATT: B-R-U-M-E.

01:25:04.979 --> 01:25:06.378
LIAM: B-R-U with an umlaut?

01:25:06.378 --> 01:25:08.079
LAURA: Oh, I bet they took the elevator down.

01:25:08.079 --> 01:25:09.479
MATT: It's a brume lift.

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:10.809
As in brumestone.

01:25:10.809 --> 01:25:12.969
MARISHA: Devexian said that the brume lift was out,

01:25:12.969 --> 01:25:14.659
so he was a goddamn liar.

01:25:14.659 --> 01:25:16.949
LAURA: Well, there might not be an elevator in there,

01:25:16.949 --> 01:25:17.782
they might've found a way

01:25:17.782 --> 01:25:18.879
to just drop down.
SAM: Shut your mouth!

01:25:18.879 --> 01:25:19.940
MARISHA: That's true.

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.180
TRAVIS: Or he had an intuit charge.
SAM: Devexian is the best!

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.339
MARISHA: What?

01:25:24.339 --> 01:25:26.699
TRAVIS: No, that's too much.
MARISHA: Devexian?

01:25:26.699 --> 01:25:27.532
LAURA: No--

01:25:29.059 --> 01:25:32.379
SAM: Did that explosion make a loud noise?

01:25:32.379 --> 01:25:35.486
MATT: It made no sound.
MARISHA: Never trust a sexy robot.

01:25:35.486 --> 01:25:37.924
MATT: But you all just gradually and--

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:40.769
I'd like you both to make saves for me.

01:25:40.769 --> 01:25:43.953
LAURA: I'm going to heal.
TRAVIS: There's only one Steve Rogers, goddamn it.

01:25:43.953 --> 01:25:45.090
Is it a wisdom save?

01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:46.430
MATT: Wisdom, yeah.

01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:48.779
LAURA: I'm going to hit Fjord
with a level three Cure Wounds.

01:25:48.779 --> 01:25:49.919
TRAVIS: 16.
LIAM: You going to hit that shit?

01:25:49.919 --> 01:25:51.680
TALIESIN: If she went unconscious--
ASHLEY: 20 total.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.435
MATT: Well, yeah, you're fine now,

01:25:54.435 --> 01:25:55.849
did you heal her?

01:25:55.849 --> 01:25:56.682
TALIESIN: Once she was unconscious,

01:25:56.682 --> 01:25:57.959
yeah, I brought her back.

01:25:57.959 --> 01:25:59.959
MATT: You said Spare the Dying, which keeps them from dying.

01:25:59.959 --> 01:26:00.792
TALIESIN: And then I healed her.

01:26:00.792 --> 01:26:01.625
MATT: Then you healed her? Okay.

01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:02.458
So yeah, you're no longer stunned,

01:26:02.458 --> 01:26:05.289
so you're conscious, coming to in horrible pain.

01:26:05.289 --> 01:26:07.909
And you remain stunned.
TRAVIS: 16, okay.

01:26:07.909 --> 01:26:09.669
ASHLEY: That was not fun.

01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:11.548
LAURA: You got-- wait, did I do that math right?

01:26:11.548 --> 01:26:12.381
15.

01:26:14.139 --> 01:26:16.019
15 plus seven?

01:26:16.019 --> 01:26:16.852
TRAVIS: 22.

01:26:16.852 --> 01:26:19.147
LAURA: 22, plus five?

01:26:19.147 --> 01:26:20.549
TRAVIS: 27.

01:26:20.549 --> 01:26:24.028
LAURA: That's a really good heal for a level three.

01:26:24.028 --> 01:26:26.279
MATT: (growling)

01:26:26.279 --> 01:26:27.112
SAM: Oh no.

01:26:27.112 --> 01:26:29.059
MATT: You glance over the source of the sound,

01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:30.609
which is in the room you're in,

01:26:30.609 --> 01:26:32.079
you look over into the far corner

01:26:32.079 --> 01:26:35.269
to the right of where the larger entrance is.

01:26:35.269 --> 01:26:36.288
Still stunned.

01:26:36.288 --> 01:26:39.509
ASHLEY: May I Healing Hands on myself?
MATT: You can, yes, you can.

01:26:39.509 --> 01:26:41.892
You see an opening or a pit of some kind

01:26:41.892 --> 01:26:43.239
in the far right hand of the chamber

01:26:43.239 --> 01:26:45.449
that has a metallic grate over it,

01:26:45.449 --> 01:26:47.279
though it appears to have been jostled a bit

01:26:47.279 --> 01:26:49.059
and is a little loose on its mooning.

01:26:49.059 --> 01:26:51.319
And you hear this deep alien growl

01:26:51.319 --> 01:26:53.413
that echoes from beneath the pit.

01:26:53.413 --> 01:26:55.419
TRAVIS: Sarlacc!

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:56.453
Rancor!

01:26:56.453 --> 01:26:58.429
Wrong one!

01:26:58.429 --> 01:26:59.932
The Star Wars monsters!

01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:04.649
MARISHA: You said-- is the grate ajar enough

01:27:04.649 --> 01:27:06.699
to where something could get out of it?

01:27:06.699 --> 01:27:07.732
MATT: It's possible.

01:27:08.649 --> 01:27:09.979
LIAM: The sound's coming from under it?

01:27:09.979 --> 01:27:10.812
MATT: Yeah.

01:27:10.812 --> 01:27:13.769
You also hear-- the three of you immediately

01:27:13.769 --> 01:27:15.849
splashing coming from the hallway

01:27:15.849 --> 01:27:17.039
where you guys came from.

01:27:17.039 --> 01:27:19.252
Remember, this is a 300-foot radius.

01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:21.702
LAURA: Right.

01:27:21.702 --> 01:27:24.739
MARISHA: I grab Yasha really quick and I just grab her

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:26.869
and try and get her to her feet.

01:27:26.869 --> 01:27:28.792
We either run or we're fighting.

01:27:30.039 --> 01:27:32.206
SAM: Which way are we running?

01:27:32.206 --> 01:27:34.106
TRAVIS: (unintelligible noises)
LIAM: He's not moving.

01:27:34.106 --> 01:27:34.939
LAURA: We can pick up Fjord.

01:27:34.939 --> 01:27:36.069
MATT: You guys can glance and you see

01:27:36.069 --> 01:27:39.409
in the door where you came from across the way,

01:27:39.409 --> 01:27:40.849
one of those dog creatures

01:27:40.849 --> 01:27:43.024
with the eye at the end of its tail--

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:45.781
(groans)
LAURA: Oh, he's hurt!

01:27:45.781 --> 01:27:46.763
He took a lot of damage too.

01:27:46.763 --> 01:27:47.742
LIAM: Oh, because it's 300 feet.

01:27:47.742 --> 01:27:50.792
MARISHA: Right, let's go into the archway.

01:27:51.909 --> 01:27:53.426
MATT: So, you're going over into the archway?

01:27:53.426 --> 01:27:55.169
TRAVIS: And there's two more in the kitchen.

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:56.229
MARISHA: Right.

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:57.069
I'm assuming--

01:27:57.069 --> 01:27:58.539
MATT: That was coming from the direction of the kitchen.

01:27:58.539 --> 01:28:00.705
LIAM: Yeah, these were hit in the kitchen.

01:28:00.705 --> 01:28:02.811
MARISHA: I'm going to start
moving towards the archway, personally.

01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:03.899
LAURA: Same.
TALIESIN: Same.

01:28:03.899 --> 01:28:05.345
SAM: We're just going to leave Fjord behind?

01:28:05.345 --> 01:28:06.259
LAURA: No, I'm picking up Fjord!

01:28:06.259 --> 01:28:08.362
MARISHA: We're grabbing our fallen.

01:28:08.362 --> 01:28:09.614
MATT: Make another wisdom save for me, Fjord.

01:28:09.614 --> 01:28:10.739
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:14.089
Oh! 19 plus four, 23!

01:28:14.089 --> 01:28:16.543
MATT: You shake off the stun.
LAURA: As I'm holding you.

01:28:16.543 --> 01:28:17.769
Oh, hi!

01:28:17.769 --> 01:28:19.160
TRAVIS: Hey, hi.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.346
LAURA: You want me to keep carrying you?

01:28:20.346 --> 01:28:22.057
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go!
LAURA: Okay.

01:28:22.057 --> 01:28:22.909
MARISHA: Move.

01:28:22.909 --> 01:28:24.889
MATT: Okay, you're moving into--?

01:28:24.889 --> 01:28:27.679
MARISHA: Towards the archway that is talking about

01:28:27.679 --> 01:28:29.219
heading to the Immensus Hall.

01:28:29.219 --> 01:28:30.709
MATT: Okay.

01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:33.799
As you duck down into this tight chamber,

01:28:33.799 --> 01:28:35.749
the stairs descend until the water

01:28:35.749 --> 01:28:37.152
gets to about waist level.

01:28:37.152 --> 01:28:38.060
LAURA: Oh, of course.

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:39.724
TRAVIS: Please look for more charges!

01:28:41.398 --> 01:28:42.589
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:28:42.589 --> 01:28:43.659
MATT: You can go ahead and make a perception check.

01:28:43.659 --> 01:28:44.967
MARISHA: Sure.

01:28:45.839 --> 01:28:46.879
MATT: Since you are at the forefront of this.

01:28:46.879 --> 01:28:48.509
MARISHA: This is not my fucking strong suit!

01:28:48.509 --> 01:28:50.799
Ooh, that was better though, 21.

01:28:50.799 --> 01:28:51.659
MATT: 21, okay.

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:52.879
As you get down in there,

01:28:52.879 --> 01:28:56.049
there is a heavy mist, sourceless, that gets heavier,

01:28:56.049 --> 01:28:57.618
denser and denser the further back it goes

01:28:57.618 --> 01:28:59.599
and this is a long, small tunnel.

01:28:59.599 --> 01:29:02.309
You can only maybe go about two at a time through this.

01:29:02.309 --> 01:29:04.499
And as you look beyond,

01:29:04.499 --> 01:29:05.999
there's all sorts of fallen rubble,

01:29:05.999 --> 01:29:07.459
bits of ceiling panels that have fallen

01:29:07.459 --> 01:29:09.929
that are causing the water flow to splash back.

01:29:09.929 --> 01:29:11.299
And you're pushing through the water a bit

01:29:11.299 --> 01:29:12.999
as it's coming up to about your waist.

01:29:12.999 --> 01:29:16.469
And you glance ahead and about a hundred feet ahead

01:29:16.469 --> 01:29:18.019
in the very faint glow in the mist,

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.904
you can see other similar,

01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:24.292
slightly gyrating intuit charges.

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:25.125
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:29:25.125 --> 01:29:26.583
MARISHA: Far enough away?

01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:27.981
MATT: About a hundred feet from you.

01:29:27.981 --> 01:29:29.659
LIAM: 60-foot range to set them off.

01:29:29.659 --> 01:29:32.779
MARISHA: Okay, so I stop everybody immediately.

01:29:32.779 --> 01:29:34.312
And point them out.

01:29:34.312 --> 01:29:36.799
TRAVIS: They're not just proximity based.

01:29:36.799 --> 01:29:39.082
MARISHA: Yeah, they can also be let go.

01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:39.999
LIAM: One or the other, though.

01:29:39.999 --> 01:29:41.549
MATT: As she points this out,

01:29:41.549 --> 01:29:44.107
you also hear on the other side of the chamber--

01:29:44.107 --> 01:29:46.779
(growling)

01:29:46.779 --> 01:29:48.519
TRAVIS: Oh, we got to go.

01:29:48.519 --> 01:29:49.879
LIAM: In the chamber we just came into

01:29:49.879 --> 01:29:51.761
or in--
TRAVIS: Other side?

01:29:51.761 --> 01:29:53.199
MATT: No, the chamber that you were just in,

01:29:53.199 --> 01:29:54.992
you have intuit charges ahead of you

01:29:54.992 --> 01:29:56.549
and you have--
ASHLEY: Monster behind us.

01:29:56.549 --> 01:29:58.810
MATT: Hurt monsters behind you.
MARISHA: Monster jaws behind us.

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:01.139
Yeah, we're sandwiched.

01:30:01.139 --> 01:30:02.159
TRAVIS: We're fighting monsters.

01:30:02.159 --> 01:30:03.825
MATT: Well, it's up to you guys, what do you want to do?

01:30:03.825 --> 01:30:05.549
LIAM: I use Allura's Staff of Power

01:30:05.549 --> 01:30:08.779
to fill the archway that we just came through

01:30:08.779 --> 01:30:11.079
with a Wall of Force once everyone is through it.

01:30:11.079 --> 01:30:12.629
TRAVIS: Or I could do the Gate!

01:30:13.509 --> 01:30:15.426
MARISHA: Oh, to get us on the other side!

01:30:15.426 --> 01:30:16.810
TRAVIS: Yeah!
LAURA: Do that!

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:18.495
TRAVIS: But I need to see--

01:30:18.495 --> 01:30:20.699
I only have darkvision for 60 feet, how far away

01:30:20.699 --> 01:30:21.532
are the intuit charges?
LIAM: I just bought us

01:30:21.532 --> 01:30:22.509
10 minutes of thinking time.

01:30:22.509 --> 01:30:24.319
MATT: The first one's a hundred feet from you

01:30:24.319 --> 01:30:27.339
and the mist blocks your vision

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:28.399
to even see the second one.

01:30:28.399 --> 01:30:30.199
You just see a faint glow in the mist of a similar light.

01:30:30.199 --> 01:30:31.869
TRAVIS: I have to be able to see--
TALIESIN: Have to go real far.

01:30:31.869 --> 01:30:34.319
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have to be able to see it.
LAURA: I can shoot--

01:30:34.319 --> 01:30:35.869
does Dispel Magic--?
LIAM: I already did it.

01:30:35.869 --> 01:30:37.499
There is a Wall of Force

01:30:37.499 --> 01:30:39.239
blocking anything in that chamber

01:30:39.239 --> 01:30:42.559
that we just left from coming after us physically.

01:30:42.559 --> 01:30:44.449
So if there were mages, they could cast at us,

01:30:44.449 --> 01:30:46.706
but physically nothing can come through.

01:30:46.706 --> 01:30:49.069
SAM: Can you send your duplicate ahead?

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:49.902
LAURA: I mean, yeah, but--

01:30:49.902 --> 01:30:51.339
TALIESIN: It would still set off and hurt us.

01:30:51.339 --> 01:30:53.974
LAURA: I don't think it would
because it's not a living creature.

01:30:53.974 --> 01:30:55.469
ASHLEY: But it's 300 feet?
SAM: It would still hurt us

01:30:55.469 --> 01:30:57.089
though, if it got set off.
LAURA: But I have to be able to see

01:30:57.089 --> 01:30:58.259
what my duplicate is doing.

01:30:58.259 --> 01:30:59.679
TALIESIN: Is there a way to dispel them?

01:30:59.679 --> 01:31:02.519
LIAM: That's what I'm thinking, I have Dispel Magic

01:31:02.519 --> 01:31:05.369
and it goes 120 feet.

01:31:05.369 --> 01:31:07.299
SAM: We had these intuit charges.

01:31:07.299 --> 01:31:08.479
Do we know what--?

01:31:08.479 --> 01:31:10.999
LAURA: Yeah, do we remember if Dispel Magic would work?

01:31:10.999 --> 01:31:11.832
MATT: You don't know.

01:31:11.832 --> 01:31:13.459
LIAM: How far does Mage Hand go?

01:31:13.459 --> 01:31:14.292
SAM: 30 feet.

01:31:15.339 --> 01:31:16.649
TRAVIS: Don't set it off.

01:31:16.649 --> 01:31:17.665
LAURA: No.

01:31:19.129 --> 01:31:23.149
SAM: You, Jester, you can get past it.

01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:24.729
You can Dimension Door past it.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:25.754
LAURA: Yeah, but I have to see.

01:31:25.754 --> 01:31:27.119
I mean, I would have no idea

01:31:27.119 --> 01:31:28.719
where I'm Dimension Door-ing to.

01:31:29.609 --> 01:31:31.359
SAM: You've got Sprinkle to guide you.

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:36.229
He just puked on your shoulder, but--

01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:38.089
TRAVIS: Dispel Magic's 120 feet?

01:31:38.089 --> 01:31:39.755
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Use it.

01:31:39.755 --> 01:31:40.659
Try, find out,

01:31:40.659 --> 01:31:42.339
otherwise we're fighting monsters.

01:31:42.339 --> 01:31:43.929
Can't take this fight into the room.

01:31:43.929 --> 01:31:45.212
We'll get popped.

01:31:46.569 --> 01:31:47.402
LAURA: Okay.

01:31:48.529 --> 01:31:50.292
I can do a level four.

01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:54.079
And how far are the two away from each other?

01:31:54.079 --> 01:31:56.950
MATT: You can't quite see how far the the second one is

01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:59.249
because the mist that fills the chamber

01:31:59.249 --> 01:32:01.219
and blocks your vision,

01:32:01.219 --> 01:32:02.569
it makes it hard to see depth.

01:32:02.569 --> 01:32:03.919
TRAVIS: Do you have Dispel Magic?

01:32:05.084 --> 01:32:06.307
TALIESIN: It's not my bag.

01:32:06.307 --> 01:32:07.539
Well, actually wait.

01:32:07.539 --> 01:32:09.769
MATT: At this distance, what you see is the one

01:32:09.769 --> 01:32:12.119
that's still-- you can see crisply

01:32:12.119 --> 01:32:12.969
some of the lights even though

01:32:12.969 --> 01:32:14.099
it is partially obscured by the mist.

01:32:14.099 --> 01:32:14.932
TALIESIN: I do.

01:32:14.932 --> 01:32:16.809
MATT: And you can see the second glow that's deep enough in

01:32:16.809 --> 01:32:18.039
where you can just see the glow,

01:32:18.039 --> 01:32:20.342
but you do not have a direct line of sight on it.

01:32:20.342 --> 01:32:22.289
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: If you guys both have 120,

01:32:22.289 --> 01:32:24.069
you should at least try one.

01:32:24.069 --> 01:32:24.969
Because if it doesn't work,

01:32:24.969 --> 01:32:27.381
then we're fighting these things.

01:32:27.381 --> 01:32:30.040
LIAM: I can do the same and regain it back if we rest

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.299
because I can draw on some energy.
LAURA: Oh, then maybe you should do it

01:32:32.299 --> 01:32:33.132
because we don't get our

01:32:33.132 --> 01:32:33.965
spells back at rests.
TALIESIN: Could we get

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:35.906
close enough to it where you might be able to hit both

01:32:35.906 --> 01:32:37.286
of them in one shot?

01:32:37.286 --> 01:32:39.729
LAURA: With a level four, you could try to get both.

01:32:39.729 --> 01:32:41.869
SAM: How many monsters were there?

01:32:41.869 --> 01:32:43.428
TALIESIN: Three minimum.
TRAVIS: At least.

01:32:43.428 --> 01:32:44.902
SAM: And they're injured badly.
LIAM: It's one object,

01:32:44.902 --> 01:32:47.589
I can't do both, it specifically states one object.

01:32:47.589 --> 01:32:50.569
SAM: Does anyone have the ability to charm

01:32:50.569 --> 01:32:52.002
or control the monster?

01:32:52.002 --> 01:32:53.029
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:32:53.029 --> 01:32:54.503
SAM: Yes?
LAURA: I can't control monsters.

01:32:54.503 --> 01:32:55.616
SAM: Great, he just said yes.

01:32:55.616 --> 01:32:59.589
TRAVIS: I do, but I thought when you Extracted Aspects

01:32:59.589 --> 01:33:03.314
it was immune to necrotic, fire,

01:33:03.314 --> 01:33:05.959
and charm?
MARISHA: It's immune to necrotic and--

01:33:05.959 --> 01:33:06.986
TRAVIS: The eye did something.
LIAM: Radiant.

01:33:06.986 --> 01:33:07.829
MARISHA: And radiant.

01:33:07.829 --> 01:33:08.719
SAM: But that was one kind of monster,

01:33:08.719 --> 01:33:09.839
are these all the same kind of monster?

01:33:09.839 --> 01:33:10.939
LIAM: So far, they're all.

01:33:10.939 --> 01:33:12.280
MARISHA: They've all been immune to

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.638
necrotic and radiant.
SAM: But we don't know what the Sarlacc

01:33:13.638 --> 01:33:14.649
monster is.

01:33:14.649 --> 01:33:17.159
MARISHA: Well, if it's the panther-like thing

01:33:17.159 --> 01:33:19.179
with the eyeball then it's the nullifier,

01:33:19.179 --> 01:33:21.123
which we've already faced.

01:33:21.123 --> 01:33:24.039
SAM: And it's also immune to charm?

01:33:24.039 --> 01:33:25.499
MARISHA: Yeah, I got that.
LIAM: Twice she's got that.

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:28.989
MARISHA: I didn't say charm, all I got was--

01:33:28.989 --> 01:33:30.769
I don't have those notes.

01:33:30.769 --> 01:33:33.019
TALIESIN: I thought it was the same as the psychic, charmed,

01:33:33.019 --> 01:33:35.189
frightened, you just can't mess with the brain.

01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:36.147
MARISHA: That's the Tomb Takers.

01:33:36.147 --> 01:33:37.699
TALIESIN: Yeah, I thought it had a similar build, though.

01:33:37.699 --> 01:33:40.409
MATT: The ones that you've gone against are the reverser

01:33:40.409 --> 01:33:42.869
and the absorber and the nullifier.

01:33:42.869 --> 01:33:45.479
The ones that you saw, the bear-like ones

01:33:45.479 --> 01:33:48.389
that were towards the ledge where you came in,

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:50.212
which are the reversers,

01:33:51.649 --> 01:33:53.759
and the absorbers are the ones with the eye

01:33:53.759 --> 01:33:56.369
that are coming in from the kitchen.

01:33:56.369 --> 01:33:58.829
None of them are immune to charm.

01:33:58.829 --> 01:34:00.027
They're only immune to

01:34:00.027 --> 01:34:01.694
radiant and necrotic damage.
LAURA: Okay.

01:34:02.104 --> 01:34:02.948
LIAM: So--

01:34:02.948 --> 01:34:06.243
SAM: So we could charm one to go in for us.

01:34:06.243 --> 01:34:08.125
LIAM: But it's 60 feet.
SAM: I know, I know.

01:34:08.125 --> 01:34:08.958
LIAM: The distance to set off,

01:34:08.958 --> 01:34:10.459
was 300 feet.
SAM: We can back up.

01:34:10.459 --> 01:34:13.103
MATT: Caleb, I would also like you to roll a d20.

01:34:13.103 --> 01:34:14.756
LIAM: Okay, I just put a Wall of Force up.

01:34:14.756 --> 01:34:16.063
TRAVIS: I could go for two.
LIAM: Eight.

01:34:16.063 --> 01:34:17.237
TRAVIS: Monsters.
MATT: Okay.

01:34:17.237 --> 01:34:19.424
And you cast a level three Heal, correct?

01:34:19.424 --> 01:34:20.257
LAURA: Yeah.

01:34:20.257 --> 01:34:22.465
MATT: I'd like you to roll a d20 for me.

01:34:24.057 --> 01:34:24.898
LAURA: Two.

01:34:24.898 --> 01:34:26.154
MATT: Okay, and you cast?

01:34:26.154 --> 01:34:27.062
TALIESIN: A level two heal.

01:34:27.062 --> 01:34:27.895
MATT: Then you're fine.

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:30.922
LIAM: To clarify, there's two intuit charges, you said?

01:34:30.922 --> 01:34:32.364
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: There are two that you can see.

01:34:32.364 --> 01:34:34.379
LIAM: One that's more visible than the other?

01:34:34.379 --> 01:34:35.737
LAURA: We could try for the front one--
MATT: Yes.

01:34:35.737 --> 01:34:37.928
LAURA: -- and then move forward
a little bit, try for the second one.

01:34:37.928 --> 01:34:39.300
LIAM: Yeah, we could do that.

01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:40.536
MATT: One is partially obscured by mist,

01:34:40.536 --> 01:34:42.639
the other is heavily obscured by the mist.

01:34:42.639 --> 01:34:43.627
You can only tell it's there

01:34:43.627 --> 01:34:46.193
because of the faint bit of a similar light glow.

01:34:46.193 --> 01:34:49.160
LIAM: I think I should try to dispel the first one.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.176
We could try to do the second.

01:34:50.176 --> 01:34:52.648
We could also try to gate and catch it

01:34:52.648 --> 01:34:55.818
in the Bag of Holding, through the door.

01:34:55.818 --> 01:34:57.994
TALIESIN: That's a big risk.
LIAM: That's a lot.

01:34:57.994 --> 01:34:59.326
MATT: You also don't have a Bag of Holding.

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:00.284
MARISHA: We don't have a Bag of Holding.

01:35:00.284 --> 01:35:01.350
LAURA: I have a Haversack.
LIAM: Well, we can't do that.

01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:02.830
Why would you suggest that, Fjord?

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:04.430
LAURA: A Haversack is basically a Bag of Holding,

01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:06.701
just smaller.
MATT: Yeah, smaller pouches.

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:09.467
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out my--
TRAVIS: It's a terrible idea.

01:35:09.467 --> 01:35:10.666
ASHLEY: -- the Holy Avenger,

01:35:10.666 --> 01:35:12.015
I'm just going to hold on to it.
MATT: Okay.

01:35:12.015 --> 01:35:14.615
TRAVIS: And I'll be facing the direction of the sound,

01:35:14.615 --> 01:35:15.605
just in case they come around.

01:35:15.605 --> 01:35:17.940
LAURA: You try Dispel; if it works,

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.286
can you regain more than one spell back on a short rest?

01:35:20.286 --> 01:35:23.962
LIAM: No, I can regain back a certain amount, so.

01:35:23.962 --> 01:35:24.987
TALIESIN: If we figure out it works--

01:35:24.987 --> 01:35:26.817
LIAM: It's not bad. I should do it,

01:35:26.817 --> 01:35:28.136
if both are successful, great,

01:35:28.136 --> 01:35:30.830
I can get some of my mojo back.

01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:32.244
So I'm going to try it on the first.

01:35:32.244 --> 01:35:33.967
MATT: So as you guys are doing this, by the way,

01:35:33.967 --> 01:35:37.276
the Wall of Force that Caleb put up is invisible.

01:35:37.276 --> 01:35:39.340
And you can see back into the archway,

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:41.108
into the chamber where that overhead yellow light

01:35:41.108 --> 01:35:42.911
is still flickering on and off;

01:35:42.911 --> 01:35:45.740
that faint orangish-yellow glow in the chamber.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.490
And you can see coming around the corner, (growls)

01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:51.440
one of the panther-like creatures, and the eye spin

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.402
as it (growls), runs and then hits the wall.

01:35:55.402 --> 01:35:57.344
You see an arcane wave off of it

01:35:57.344 --> 01:35:59.574
as it (growls) begins to stalk.

01:35:59.574 --> 01:36:00.969
And a second one comes up behind it;

01:36:00.969 --> 01:36:02.327
and like caged tigers,

01:36:02.327 --> 01:36:06.805
they're both paring back and forth, beyond that.

01:36:06.805 --> 01:36:10.284
TRAVIS: The globe that you made around us is a radius or?

01:36:10.284 --> 01:36:12.047
LIAM: It's not a globe, it's a wall

01:36:12.047 --> 01:36:14.057
that things cannot physically pass through.

01:36:14.057 --> 01:36:17.040
TRAVIS: Okay. And the distance away from us is--?

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:17.881
LIAM: What do you mean?

01:36:17.881 --> 01:36:19.364
TRAVIS: Like us, wall.
LAURA: It's right behind us.

01:36:19.364 --> 01:36:21.189
LIAM: We're right there, we're in front of a glass.

01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:22.055
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:36:22.055 --> 01:36:23.871
LIAM: Invisible barrier.
TALIESIN: An aquarium.

01:36:23.871 --> 01:36:25.133
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:36:25.133 --> 01:36:26.896
LIAM: It's like we're on the Nostromo right now.

01:36:26.896 --> 01:36:30.587
MATT: You also see crawling into vision, behind them,

01:36:30.587 --> 01:36:33.376
one of the greenish-red bear creatures

01:36:33.376 --> 01:36:35.292
clawing along the wall.
TRAVIS: So three.

01:36:35.292 --> 01:36:37.142
MATT: That also looks like it's a bit scrambled.

01:36:37.142 --> 01:36:40.017
It's (snarling), and it turns over,

01:36:40.017 --> 01:36:41.750
and you watch as a tentacle

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:43.731
whips out and grabs it and pulls it out of view.

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:45.114
TRAVIS: Ooh!
MATT: From something else

01:36:45.114 --> 01:36:48.299
that seems to have crawled up from the chamber below.

01:36:48.299 --> 01:36:49.799
SAM: And we don't recognize the tentacle?

01:36:49.799 --> 01:36:52.121
LIAM: Does it look like the thing that almost got Fjord,

01:36:52.121 --> 01:36:55.440
stopping him from teleporting, in that one room?

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.321
Bipedal, two footed little--

01:36:57.321 --> 01:36:58.886
MATT: You do not, you could not be able to tell from that.

01:36:58.886 --> 01:37:00.782
It was very quick.
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:37:00.782 --> 01:37:02.810
LIAM: That's what it is.
MATT: But immediately the two other creatures

01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:03.643
(growling).

01:37:03.643 --> 01:37:05.156
SAM: Ooh, yeah, maybe they'll kill each other.

01:37:05.156 --> 01:37:06.980
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: And you begin to hear the sounds

01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:10.386
of combat happening within the previous chamber you were in.

01:37:10.386 --> 01:37:11.219
SAM: Great, great.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah,

01:37:11.219 --> 01:37:12.915
kill each other, kill each other!
TALIESIN: Let's not wait until there's a winner.

01:37:12.915 --> 01:37:16.624
SAM: Ooh, wait, what about the dome?

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:18.819
TALIESIN: What about it?

01:37:18.819 --> 01:37:19.875
MARISHA: Could we get in the dome?

01:37:19.875 --> 01:37:22.539
SAM: Get in the dome and set off the intuit charge?

01:37:22.539 --> 01:37:25.607
MARISHA: (laughs) Well, it-- but the--

01:37:25.607 --> 01:37:27.918
LIAM: The wall will be down by the time the dome is up,

01:37:27.918 --> 01:37:29.152
but maybe they'll kill each other?

01:37:29.152 --> 01:37:30.569
MARISHA: Does the dome protect--
LAURA: Let's just try to dispel

01:37:30.569 --> 01:37:32.143
the intuit charge first.

01:37:32.143 --> 01:37:34.859
Give it a try, give it a try.

01:37:34.859 --> 01:37:37.367
TRAVIS: Can you do that and the Wall stays up?

01:37:37.367 --> 01:37:39.542
LIAM: Yeah, the wall is from the--

01:37:39.542 --> 01:37:41.790
Well, it's still concentra-- is it?

01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:42.631
Hold on.

01:37:42.631 --> 01:37:44.445
LAURA: Dispel isn't a concentration.

01:37:44.445 --> 01:37:47.687
LIAM: Wall of Force is concentration.

01:37:47.687 --> 01:37:50.121
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

01:37:50.121 --> 01:37:51.791
So I can't do any new concentration spells,

01:37:51.791 --> 01:37:53.750
but Dispel Magic is not concentration.

01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:54.997
MATT: Indeed.

01:37:54.997 --> 01:37:56.675
LIAM: So I will just try it on the first one.

01:37:56.675 --> 01:37:59.368
I will do it at 4th-level.

01:37:59.368 --> 01:38:01.768
MATT: 4th-level? All right.

01:38:02.804 --> 01:38:06.921
As you reach out and concentrate on the charge,

01:38:07.768 --> 01:38:12.768
releasing the unraveling tethers of your arcana,

01:38:12.798 --> 01:38:16.088
the charge hovering and slowly revolving in place.

01:38:16.088 --> 01:38:19.501
The lights around it, the glow within its runes,

01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:20.562
flash brightly,

01:38:20.562 --> 01:38:23.738
and then (click, impacts) splash into the water below.

01:38:23.738 --> 01:38:25.954
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.
LAURA: That's awesome.

01:38:25.954 --> 01:38:26.787
SAM: Can you do that again?

01:38:26.787 --> 01:38:27.764
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

01:38:27.764 --> 01:38:28.737
TRAVIS: We're picking that motherfucker up.
TALIESIN: Do you want to, or?

01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:29.930
MARISHA: Yeah, we are.
LIAM: Yes, we are.

01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:30.763
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:38:30.763 --> 01:38:33.365
LIAM: That's Solid Snake just (clicks).

01:38:33.365 --> 01:38:35.121
(laughter)

01:38:35.121 --> 01:38:35.954
TALIESIN: I'm going to do--

01:38:35.954 --> 01:38:37.670
TRAVIS: Just one of two that we can see.
TALIESIN: -- perception scan.

01:38:37.670 --> 01:38:39.042
Do we see anything else?

01:38:39.042 --> 01:38:39.875
TRAVIS: Can you guys do--

01:38:39.875 --> 01:38:41.615
how far is Detect Magic and shit?

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:43.740
TALIESIN: Oh.
SAM: 60?

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.933
TALIESIN: I've got a Detect Magic, that is--

01:38:46.933 --> 01:38:48.397
MATT: Detect Magic is level one, I believe, right?

01:38:48.397 --> 01:38:50.758
TALIESIN: Yeah, but I've got a use of it that's--

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:53.048
LAURA: Oh yeah, roll a d20.

01:38:53.048 --> 01:38:54.464
MATT: Indeed.
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:38:54.464 --> 01:38:55.297
LIAM: Eight.

01:38:55.297 --> 01:38:56.217
MATT: Okay, you're fine.

01:38:56.217 --> 01:38:58.281
TALIESIN: I've got a Detect Magic that's 30 feet,

01:38:58.281 --> 01:39:00.519
so maybe one more, a little further in.

01:39:00.519 --> 01:39:01.979
Actually, it stays up, doesn't it?

01:39:01.979 --> 01:39:03.279
MATT: It is concentration again.

01:39:03.279 --> 01:39:04.879
LIAM: Ten minutes, 30 feet.
TALIESIN: So I'll cast Detect Magic

01:39:04.879 --> 01:39:06.687
as we're moving forward.
MATT: Okay, all right.

01:39:06.687 --> 01:39:08.368
To remind you, too, you do detect beyond

01:39:08.368 --> 01:39:09.320
the equipment that's on you,

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.595
there is still the armor and the weapon

01:39:11.595 --> 01:39:13.683
that you found from the security corpse previously.

01:39:13.683 --> 01:39:14.950
LAURA: Oh, that we haven't identified!

01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:17.523
LIAM: Well, the weapon wasn't
the one that Veth has tried once?

01:39:17.523 --> 01:39:19.027
MATT: Correct, that one.

01:39:19.027 --> 01:39:22.061
LIAM: So, your newfangled Force Bolt.

01:39:22.061 --> 01:39:22.894
TALIESIN: Is magic.

01:39:22.894 --> 01:39:24.357
LIAM: Telekinesis crossbow?
TRAVIS: The blaster crossbow.

01:39:24.357 --> 01:39:25.323
LIAM: Remember?
SAM: Oh that's right,

01:39:25.323 --> 01:39:26.580
I have a crossbow!

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.724
LIAM: And some unidentified space armor.

01:39:28.724 --> 01:39:30.773
LAURA: Are we going to take an hour to do the Heroes' Feast?

01:39:30.773 --> 01:39:32.447
LIAM: Not here.
LAURA: No, no, no, but--

01:39:32.447 --> 01:39:33.689
LIAM: Hopefully.
SAM: What is that thing?

01:39:33.689 --> 01:39:35.589
MARISHA: I would like to.
MATT: Okay.

01:39:35.589 --> 01:39:36.688
MARISHA: I feel like it's clutch.
TALIESIN: 20 perception.

01:39:36.688 --> 01:39:37.530
MATT: 20 perception.

01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:39.403
As you guys glance ahead,

01:39:39.403 --> 01:39:41.178
the water that is rushing towards you,

01:39:41.178 --> 01:39:45.719
there is-- you see a slight change in the path of it.

01:39:45.719 --> 01:39:50.535
You can see some of it is drifting into
an opening to a side chamber down this hall.

01:39:51.405 --> 01:39:53.647
And this chamber goes into darkness

01:39:53.647 --> 01:39:57.207
beyond the faint orange or the faint bluish teal glow

01:39:57.207 --> 01:40:01.632
of the mist-obscured intuit charge.

01:40:01.632 --> 01:40:03.737
TALIESIN: All right, let's get
a little closer to this, then.

01:40:03.737 --> 01:40:04.998
LAURA: ♪ Get a little closer ♪

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:07.705
TRAVIS: Will the wall stay up, no matter how far we move?

01:40:07.705 --> 01:40:10.155
LIAM: It's concentration, so I think it stays.

01:40:10.155 --> 01:40:12.607
MATT: It stays, for as long as it lasts.

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:14.434
LIAM: I'm going to-- I don't want to fuck around.

01:40:14.434 --> 01:40:17.341
I'm going to do another 4th-level Dispel

01:40:17.341 --> 01:40:19.869
and get rid of the second intuit.

01:40:19.869 --> 01:40:20.726
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: As we get closer.

01:40:20.726 --> 01:40:21.717
MARISHA: As we creep forward.

01:40:21.717 --> 01:40:23.302
MATT: Okay. As you guys are creeping forward,

01:40:23.302 --> 01:40:24.876
you hear-- (heavy impacts)

01:40:24.876 --> 01:40:27.307
and you glance behind and you can see

01:40:27.307 --> 01:40:29.456
the edge of a creature coming into view.

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:33.519
This bulbous-looking abomination, itself

01:40:33.519 --> 01:40:37.454
three elephant-like legs out of the side of a central

01:40:37.454 --> 01:40:40.182
fleshy body with an open-toothed mouth.

01:40:40.182 --> 01:40:41.584
You see it has this

01:40:41.584 --> 01:40:43.487
long tendril and this weird eye stalk,

01:40:43.487 --> 01:40:46.448
and it seems to have this long tentacle

01:40:46.448 --> 01:40:49.167
with these teeth-like extrusions out of the bottom of it.

01:40:49.167 --> 01:40:51.132
And it looks like it's got gashes all over it,

01:40:51.132 --> 01:40:52.121
and it's whipping around.

01:40:52.121 --> 01:40:54.915
And one of the small, panther-like creatures

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:56.960
with the eye tail leaps onto it,

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:59.253
as it (growls) rummages back

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:01.356
and slams into a nearby wall out of sight.

01:41:01.356 --> 01:41:03.034
The battle continues to rage on behind you.

01:41:03.034 --> 01:41:04.857
TRAVIS: T-Rex and velociraptor!

01:41:04.857 --> 01:41:08.311
LAURA: There's a whole Kaiju battle happening over there.

01:41:09.794 --> 01:41:11.221
Pull out some popcorn.

01:41:11.221 --> 01:41:12.571
TALIESIN: Let them fight.

01:41:12.571 --> 01:41:13.512
(laughter)

01:41:13.512 --> 01:41:18.309
MATT: Continuing on, you begin
to get nervous with proximity,

01:41:18.309 --> 01:41:20.798
but slowly you begin to take in a little bit more shape.

01:41:20.798 --> 01:41:22.742
Make a perception check for me, Caleb.

01:41:22.742 --> 01:41:25.272
LIAM: Did I successfully Dispel the second charge?

01:41:25.272 --> 01:41:27.626
MATT: We're getting to the point
where you can see it enough to Dispel it.

01:41:27.626 --> 01:41:28.911
LIAM: Okay, what am I rolling for?

01:41:28.911 --> 01:41:30.086
MATT: Perception.
LIAM: Perception.

01:41:30.086 --> 01:41:31.373
LAURA: Can I Guidance him?

01:41:31.373 --> 01:41:32.741
MATT: Sure.
LIAM: I already rolled. Okay.

01:41:32.741 --> 01:41:34.296
MATT: I'll allow you to Guidance him.

01:41:34.296 --> 01:41:36.746
LIAM: Thank you, 18.

01:41:36.746 --> 01:41:38.037
MATT: 18.

01:41:38.037 --> 01:41:40.229
You start getting to that nervous point where you're like,

01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:41.745
"Are we getting too close?
We're getting too close."

01:41:41.745 --> 01:41:44.488
And then right as you begin to have that sense,

01:41:44.488 --> 01:41:47.030
you can just make out the fine detail of the runes,

01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:49.226
which is the part that you need to be able to see,

01:41:49.226 --> 01:41:50.821
to unravel the magic.

01:41:50.821 --> 01:41:51.983
You go ahead and cast it at what level?

01:41:51.983 --> 01:41:54.133
LIAM: 4th.
MATT: 4th-level again.

01:41:54.133 --> 01:41:55.191
(whooshes)

01:41:55.191 --> 01:41:57.068
SAM: Nice.
TRAVIS: Fucking yes!

01:41:57.068 --> 01:41:59.062
SAM: There could be more, there could be more.

01:41:59.062 --> 01:42:01.217
LAURA: Yeah, we look around for any glows.

01:42:01.217 --> 01:42:03.768
MATT: Okay, glancing around,
you don't see any additional glows,

01:42:03.768 --> 01:42:06.424
but what you do see is what
Caduceus had mentioned before;

01:42:06.424 --> 01:42:08.262
there is an open door, where some of the water

01:42:08.262 --> 01:42:12.203
is flowing into, as you're
slowly (whooshes) pushing through.

01:42:12.203 --> 01:42:16.426
You can read the top of the door, which reads,

01:42:16.426 --> 01:42:18.651
Security Storage.
LIAM: No, I can't, ah.

01:42:18.651 --> 01:42:19.484
MATT: Oh yeah, you can't.

01:42:19.484 --> 01:42:20.908
LIAM: Because the Wall's up.
MATT: That's right, never mind.

01:42:20.908 --> 01:42:22.950
LIAM: That says, (gibberish).

01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:25.146
MATT: Well, it looks to be a storage facility,

01:42:25.146 --> 01:42:26.702
where certain things may have been secured.

01:42:26.702 --> 01:42:28.291
(laughter)

01:42:28.291 --> 01:42:31.245
SAM: Is that the only door that we see?

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:32.871
MATT: Where you currently stand, yes.

01:42:32.871 --> 01:42:34.777
SAM: But it's not the only path?

01:42:34.777 --> 01:42:36.276
MATT: No, there's the hallway ahead of you

01:42:36.276 --> 01:42:37.232
where the mist continues,

01:42:37.232 --> 01:42:40.769
and this is just a side chamber here in the center.

01:42:40.769 --> 01:42:43.341
The room is maybe five by 10 feet, it is very small.

01:42:43.341 --> 01:42:45.941
You can see all manner of wall hooks

01:42:45.941 --> 01:42:49.660
and shelves and placement for all sorts of things.

01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.988
But it has been cleared out

01:42:51.988 --> 01:42:54.167
beyond the rubble and fallen cases.

01:42:55.225 --> 01:42:57.858
TALIESIN: I've got Detect Magic up, so.

01:42:57.858 --> 01:42:59.662
MATT: You do.

01:42:59.662 --> 01:43:03.914
You see a faint bit of magical essence

01:43:03.914 --> 01:43:06.525
coming from one of the heavily buried

01:43:06.525 --> 01:43:10.560
small leather cases, under the water.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.559
MARISHA: I was going to say,
we're still underwater, right?

01:43:12.559 --> 01:43:14.121
MATT: You guys are about waist-high in water, yeah.

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:14.954
LIAM: Oh!

01:43:14.954 --> 01:43:16.933
MATT: Except for Veth, who's walking onto it, thankfully.

01:43:16.933 --> 01:43:19.441
TRAVIS: It's very fucking cold.
TALIESIN: It's right over there.

01:43:19.441 --> 01:43:22.089
LIAM: They mostly come out at night.
TALIESIN: Guidance.

01:43:22.089 --> 01:43:25.371
LAURA: It could be a glyph hiding under things.

01:43:25.371 --> 01:43:26.696
TALIESIN: That's true.

01:43:26.696 --> 01:43:28.947
SAM: She already went under.

01:43:28.947 --> 01:43:30.099
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:43:30.099 --> 01:43:31.074
LAURA: I'm backing up.

01:43:31.074 --> 01:43:33.184
TRAVIS: Boom, depth charge.

01:43:33.184 --> 01:43:35.972
(laughter)

01:43:35.972 --> 01:43:37.438
TRAVIS: Shit!
LIAM: She just floats away.

01:43:37.438 --> 01:43:38.271
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:43:39.511 --> 01:43:40.941
MARISHA: Investigation, you said?

01:43:40.941 --> 01:43:42.099
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:43:42.099 --> 01:43:43.648
MARISHA: 20 total.

01:43:43.648 --> 01:43:44.633
MATT: 20 total.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:43:44.633 --> 01:43:45.674
MATT: All righty.

01:43:45.674 --> 01:43:49.115
MARISHA: If it looks like a glyph or an intuit charge,

01:43:49.115 --> 01:43:50.360
then I'm not going to fuck with it.

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.901
MATT: Fair enough.
TRAVIS: You're dead already!

01:43:51.901 --> 01:43:54.326
MATT: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:43:54.326 --> 01:43:55.384
TRAVIS: Is this uranium?

01:43:55.384 --> 01:43:58.479
MARISHA: Oh, shi--
MATT: (explosion)

01:43:58.479 --> 01:43:59.319
TALIESIN: Too real!

01:43:59.319 --> 01:44:00.602
LIAM: An intuit charge would have already gone off.

01:44:00.602 --> 01:44:01.435
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Right.

01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:04.024
MATT: It's just the Terminator 2
at the fence dream sequence.

01:44:04.024 --> 01:44:06.326
TRAVIS: (explosion)
(laughter)

01:44:06.326 --> 01:44:08.978
MATT: So you glance through and as you're pushing there--

01:44:08.978 --> 01:44:09.811
MARISHA: Was there is a leather case?

01:44:09.811 --> 01:44:11.535
MATT: It looks like there were a lot of cases

01:44:11.535 --> 01:44:13.136
that were tethered with arm straps

01:44:13.136 --> 01:44:14.629
to part of this shelf unit.

01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:15.902
They're just free floating in the water,

01:44:15.902 --> 01:44:17.618
and you (bubbles) push through them.

01:44:17.618 --> 01:44:22.618
One of them, it looks like it
wasn't cleaned out, and there is

01:44:23.110 --> 01:44:27.538
three very smooth, refined-looking
crystal vials within.

01:44:27.538 --> 01:44:30.520
MARISHA: All right, I'll just grab the whole leather satchel

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.044
and come back.
MATT: Okay, you grab it.

01:44:32.044 --> 01:44:33.609
What you do notice, and some of you pick up, too,

01:44:33.609 --> 01:44:34.606
when you're in the room,

01:44:34.606 --> 01:44:38.988
there are all these open cases on the shelf here.

01:44:38.988 --> 01:44:42.258
Within them, there is some sort of heavier padding,

01:44:42.258 --> 01:44:46.122
and across this padding in these multiple, multiple cases

01:44:46.122 --> 01:44:48.562
you can see cut openings;

01:44:48.562 --> 01:44:52.525
spaces where triangular-shaped devices were once set,

01:44:52.525 --> 01:44:53.912
but now lay empty.
MARISHA: This is where

01:44:53.912 --> 01:44:56.065
he fucking got them.

01:44:56.065 --> 01:44:57.595
ASHLEY: How many openings are there?

01:44:57.595 --> 01:44:58.594
So we know how many he's--

01:44:58.594 --> 01:45:00.035
MATT: Quick glance.
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

01:45:00.035 --> 01:45:02.426
MATT: About 15, 16.

01:45:02.426 --> 01:45:03.507
MARISHA: He could have a lot.

01:45:03.507 --> 01:45:05.314
LIAM: Fuck!
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:45:05.314 --> 01:45:07.995
SAM: He's only got two hands, he can only hold a few.

01:45:07.995 --> 01:45:09.138
ASHLEY: Well those, they're already gone.

01:45:09.138 --> 01:45:10.829
LIAM: They're also--
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:45:10.829 --> 01:45:11.662
MARISHA: Five are down.

01:45:11.662 --> 01:45:13.223
LIAM: They are hard to set.

01:45:13.223 --> 01:45:14.745
You have to roll real high arcana.

01:45:14.745 --> 01:45:16.205
LAURA: And they can only set two at a time,

01:45:16.205 --> 01:45:17.512
because there's only two of them.

01:45:17.512 --> 01:45:19.269
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.

01:45:19.269 --> 01:45:20.835
ASHLEY: But three of them--

01:45:20.835 --> 01:45:23.143
LAURA: Yeah it was farther away, that's why.

01:45:24.029 --> 01:45:25.612
TALIESIN: And it's very hard to get away from them

01:45:25.612 --> 01:45:26.479
once you've set them.

01:45:26.479 --> 01:45:28.350
SAM: Yeah, we're going to be fine.

01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:29.366
LIAM: Uh.
MARISHA: But it's a good point:

01:45:29.366 --> 01:45:32.099
There are basically 10 unaccounted for.

01:45:32.099 --> 01:45:33.808
TALIESIN: Wow.
LAURA: Well, some of them could have been

01:45:33.808 --> 01:45:35.232
from the last time, right?

01:45:35.232 --> 01:45:36.065
MARISHA: For sure, yeah.

01:45:36.065 --> 01:45:36.898
LAURA: I mean, we could have set off--

01:45:36.898 --> 01:45:38.655
TRAVIS: We have three now?

01:45:38.655 --> 01:45:40.137
LIAM: I think we had one leftover

01:45:40.137 --> 01:45:41.322
because we weren't able to use them.

01:45:41.322 --> 01:45:42.475
MARISHA: I think we are, too.

01:45:42.475 --> 01:45:44.522
MATT: Yeah, one leftover and the two that you recovered

01:45:44.522 --> 01:45:45.615
from the water as they came by,

01:45:45.615 --> 01:45:46.602
which cannot be set today.

01:45:46.602 --> 01:45:48.652
LIAM: Set until tomorrow, right?
MATT: Correct.

01:45:48.652 --> 01:45:50.315
TRAVIS: We could throw the shit out of them.

01:45:50.315 --> 01:45:53.378
ASHLEY: Do they make these things everywhere?

01:45:53.378 --> 01:45:54.452
LIAM: Ah, you hit my ear!

01:45:54.452 --> 01:45:55.285
SAM: Do they make them?

01:45:55.285 --> 01:45:57.435
ASHLEY: Do they make these intuit charges everywhere,

01:45:57.435 --> 01:45:59.441
or are these, like, super rare?
SAM: They came from here.

01:45:59.441 --> 01:46:00.274
LAURA: I think they came from here,

01:46:00.274 --> 01:46:02.129
so I think some of them have already been used.

01:46:02.129 --> 01:46:03.853
ASHLEY: Okay, so the ones that we had are probably?

01:46:03.853 --> 01:46:04.959
SAM: Yeah, they were from here as well.

01:46:04.959 --> 01:46:06.004
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:46:06.004 --> 01:46:10.543
MARISHA: Yeah, because we got ours
from the bag switcheroo from them.

01:46:10.543 --> 01:46:12.283
ASHLEY: That's right, okay.

01:46:12.283 --> 01:46:13.508
LAURA: Okay.

01:46:13.508 --> 01:46:16.217
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: So we keep moving forward.

01:46:16.217 --> 01:46:18.049
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: 10 minutes on the wall?

01:46:18.049 --> 01:46:18.882
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Can we sit down

01:46:18.882 --> 01:46:20.350
here and have a Heroes' Feast?

01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:21.183
LIAM: No!

01:46:22.351 --> 01:46:26.130
Unless we hear silence from
the Kaiju battle in the other room.

01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:27.509
LAURA: How long would that force wall stay up?

01:46:27.509 --> 01:46:29.109
LIAM: 10 minutes.
LAURA: Oh, that's what you just said?

01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:30.358
LIAM: Yep.
MATT: It's up to you guys.

01:46:30.358 --> 01:46:31.883
LAURA: Keep walking.
MATT: You're going to keep walking?

01:46:31.883 --> 01:46:33.723
MARISHA: Because we're still in the water, too, right?

01:46:33.723 --> 01:46:35.389
In waist-deep water?
MATT: You are.

01:46:35.389 --> 01:46:36.719
LIAM: How does it sound in the monster room?

01:46:36.719 --> 01:46:37.694
TRAVIS: And we're not going in,

01:46:37.694 --> 01:46:39.886
and the room-room is done and we're going in the mist.

01:46:39.886 --> 01:46:41.565
MATT: Well, it's been a few minutes
in searching through there,

01:46:41.565 --> 01:46:46.565
it sounds like the battle has ceased,

01:46:46.872 --> 01:46:51.453
or at least doesn't appear to be a raging battle any longer,

01:46:51.453 --> 01:46:52.732
as it has been a few minutes.

01:46:52.732 --> 01:46:54.954
LIAM: Is there any sound, any creature sound?

01:46:54.954 --> 01:46:57.750
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:59.867
LIAM: That is a 19.
MATT: 19.

01:47:02.607 --> 01:47:03.964
You don't hear anything.

01:47:03.964 --> 01:47:05.267
LIAM: Okay.

01:47:05.267 --> 01:47:07.106
TALIESIN: Let's just keep that up for a minute.

01:47:07.106 --> 01:47:09.193
TRAVIS: There's also a whole bunch of holes and passageways.

01:47:09.193 --> 01:47:10.252
They could be going around.

01:47:10.252 --> 01:47:11.368
LAURA: I mean, it's a trade-off, right?

01:47:11.368 --> 01:47:15.386
If we spend an hour resting, they could already be on--

01:47:15.386 --> 01:47:17.077
bringing the city back in that hour.

01:47:17.077 --> 01:47:19.013
LIAM: If we go a little bit farther,

01:47:19.013 --> 01:47:20.591
even if there's something alive behind us,

01:47:20.591 --> 01:47:23.704
they would maybe not follow us as far as we go and

01:47:23.704 --> 01:47:25.331
sniff around and lose interest.

01:47:25.331 --> 01:47:26.653
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:47:26.653 --> 01:47:27.918
Let's keep going a little more.
TRAVIS: Forward.

01:47:27.918 --> 01:47:29.134
LIAM: Possibly.

01:47:30.002 --> 01:47:31.379
MATT: Okay.

01:47:32.887 --> 01:47:34.772
LIAM: Keeping an eye out for intuit charges.

01:47:34.772 --> 01:47:36.780
MATT: All right.
LAURA: And for anything moving.

01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:38.700
LIAM: Nope! Just charges.
MARISHA: And glyphs.

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:41.890
MATT: So. Now, this is a two-by-two walkway here

01:47:41.890 --> 01:47:45.117
and you are pushing past hanging vent elements

01:47:45.117 --> 01:47:47.505
and cables and such.

01:47:47.505 --> 01:47:48.631
SAM: ♪ Two by two ♪

01:47:48.631 --> 01:47:51.846
MATT: So what is the marching order here?

01:47:51.846 --> 01:47:53.269
TRAVIS: Beau and I up front.

01:47:53.269 --> 01:47:56.399
MATT: Okay, Beau and Fjord up front.
LIAM: Use that truesight, girl.

01:47:56.399 --> 01:47:57.902
LAURA: I'll go second.

01:47:57.902 --> 01:47:59.719
MATT: Second, and who's with Jester?

01:47:59.719 --> 01:48:01.105
ASHLEY: I'll go with Jester.
LIAM: I'll stay at the back.

01:48:01.105 --> 01:48:02.242
MATT: All righty.

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:03.746
TALIESIN: I'll stay at the back with Caleb.

01:48:03.746 --> 01:48:06.338
MATT: Okay. Essek and Veth will be third,

01:48:06.338 --> 01:48:11.130
and then Caleb and Caduceus in the cabooses.

01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:12.930
All righty.
(laughter)

01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:13.763
TALIESIN: Jesus.

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.019
TRAVIS: You love it.

01:48:17.019 --> 01:48:20.125
MATT: You begin to push into the heavier mist.

01:48:20.125 --> 01:48:21.105
MARISHA: Still in water.

01:48:21.105 --> 01:48:24.105
MATT: Still in the water, still waist-deep.
MARISHA: All right, okay.

01:48:26.949 --> 01:48:29.386
MATT: Push on for about 30 or so feet.

01:48:29.386 --> 01:48:32.658
Those at front, Beauregard and Fjord,

01:48:32.658 --> 01:48:34.550
make perception checks.

01:48:38.789 --> 01:48:39.759
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:48:39.759 --> 01:48:41.781
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: Yay!

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:44.474
TRAVIS: 19! 16, natural 16.

01:48:44.474 --> 01:48:46.263
MATT: You both feel pretty confident

01:48:46.263 --> 01:48:50.349
that you don't immediately see any intuit charges

01:48:50.349 --> 01:48:54.341
that prevent your continued travel.

01:48:55.249 --> 01:48:56.630
What you do see,

01:48:56.630 --> 01:49:01.213
is that about 40 or so feet ahead of where you now are,

01:49:02.509 --> 01:49:05.342
the hallway opens into a new room.

01:49:06.215 --> 01:49:08.357
TRAVIS: Is there light in that room or darkness?

01:49:08.357 --> 01:49:09.286
MARISHA: Or people?

01:49:09.286 --> 01:49:11.255
MATT: There is a faint light in there, yeah.

01:49:11.255 --> 01:49:14.325
TRAVIS: What kind of light: white, colored?

01:49:14.325 --> 01:49:19.325
MATT: You can see some elements
of the same orange-yellow flickering.

01:49:19.763 --> 01:49:21.483
And with your high perception checks,

01:49:21.483 --> 01:49:23.886
a very, very faint blue light,

01:49:23.886 --> 01:49:25.787
like a deep cerulean blue

01:49:25.787 --> 01:49:28.454
along with some vibrant teal shifts.

01:49:28.454 --> 01:49:30.365
It's hard to tell, there's a lot of light

01:49:30.365 --> 01:49:33.815
fighting through the obscuring mist in this tight tunnel.

01:49:33.815 --> 01:49:38.369
MARISHA: And do I see anything
crossing in front of that light?

01:49:38.369 --> 01:49:41.179
Anything that is cutting that light off?

01:49:41.179 --> 01:49:42.820
MATT: You take a moment.

01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:44.120
You do.

01:49:45.361 --> 01:49:48.209
There is movement in that chamber.

01:49:48.209 --> 01:49:49.202
LAURA: Do you think it might be Lucien?

01:49:49.202 --> 01:49:50.869
TRAVIS: Steady or erratic?
LAURA: They're right there.

01:49:50.869 --> 01:49:54.170
TRAVIS: Like a pat-- Like a repeating, or?

01:49:54.170 --> 01:49:58.858
MARISHA: Like someone patrolling,
back and-- pacing, or yeah?

01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:02.000
MATT: With your high enough perception check,

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.936
it does not appear patterned.

01:50:03.936 --> 01:50:06.393
It appears to be a little erratic or at least,

01:50:06.393 --> 01:50:09.276
not a continuous repeating.

01:50:09.276 --> 01:50:11.000
TRAVIS: And we're still in waist-deep water, right?

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:11.929
MATT: You're still in waist-deep water

01:50:11.929 --> 01:50:13.234
that continues into the room.

01:50:13.234 --> 01:50:16.528
TRAVIS: Can I sink underneath
the water and do another check?

01:50:16.528 --> 01:50:17.361
LIAM: Oh, that's cool.

01:50:17.361 --> 01:50:19.027
MATT: Yeah, if you want to.
SAM: Rambo-style?

01:50:19.027 --> 01:50:20.152
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: Hey, wait,

01:50:20.152 --> 01:50:21.358
just out of curiosity,

01:50:21.358 --> 01:50:24.143
past where the intuit charges have been laid for us,

01:50:24.143 --> 01:50:25.833
how far have we come?

01:50:25.833 --> 01:50:27.611
MATT: You are standing a little bit past

01:50:27.611 --> 01:50:29.076
the second intuit charge.

01:50:29.076 --> 01:50:31.536
SAM: So if it went off, it would have affected

01:50:31.536 --> 01:50:34.136
the people in this room

01:50:34.136 --> 01:50:35.057
up ahead of us?

01:50:35.057 --> 01:50:36.827
MATT: It would seem so, yeah.

01:50:36.827 --> 01:50:38.023
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: It was probably--

01:50:38.023 --> 01:50:40.831
TRAVIS: 18 underneath the water.

01:50:40.831 --> 01:50:42.690
MATT: 18 underneath?
TRAVIS: It would also let him know we're here.

01:50:42.690 --> 01:50:44.366
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:50:44.366 --> 01:50:46.496
MATT: Glancing down under the water, it is murky

01:50:46.496 --> 01:50:49.041
and make it at disadvantage because it is underwater.

01:50:49.041 --> 01:50:51.242
TRAVIS: That's right.

01:50:51.242 --> 01:50:53.341
19, so 18.

01:50:53.341 --> 01:50:55.196
MATT: Yeah, okay, glancing ahead,

01:50:55.196 --> 01:50:57.723
you can see the same shimmering light

01:50:57.723 --> 01:50:59.968
coming through from the different perspectives.

01:50:59.968 --> 01:51:02.805
There is all sorts of fallen debris and such

01:51:02.805 --> 01:51:05.420
that have sunken to the bottom.

01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:06.992
You don't see anything swimming in it.

01:51:06.992 --> 01:51:08.184
TRAVIS: No glowing?

01:51:08.184 --> 01:51:10.468
MATT: I mean, there's no glowing in the water, no.

01:51:10.468 --> 01:51:13.174
The same kind of light sources from above.

01:51:13.174 --> 01:51:14.257
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

01:51:16.001 --> 01:51:17.858
LIAM: That means we can't count out,

01:51:17.858 --> 01:51:19.954
even though it's got a 300-foot damage range,

01:51:19.954 --> 01:51:23.373
you can't count out there being more of them

01:51:23.373 --> 01:51:26.513
because if an intuit charge went off in here,

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:28.372
where we were, and it would have hit them;

01:51:28.372 --> 01:51:31.339
that means they may have some sort of--

01:51:31.339 --> 01:51:34.043
SAM: Well, Lucien is immune to psychic damage anyway.

01:51:34.043 --> 01:51:34.876
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:51:34.876 --> 01:51:35.921
LIAM: But, is Cree as well, do we know?

01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:37.120
MARISHA: I don't know about Cree.

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:38.906
SAM: Cree was hurt, was Cree hurt?

01:51:38.906 --> 01:51:41.139
MARISHA: Cree was hurt really bad.
MATT: Cree was very hurt.

01:51:41.139 --> 01:51:42.053
TRAVIS: Can't you become invisible?
LIAM: It could have been

01:51:42.053 --> 01:51:42.886
from the fall and the pain.

01:51:42.886 --> 01:51:44.891
SAM: I can become invisible.
TRAVIS: I can make a gate here

01:51:44.891 --> 01:51:46.472
and put it in the other fucking room

01:51:46.472 --> 01:51:48.614
and you could walk out invisible and take a look.

01:51:48.614 --> 01:51:51.998
He'll see you, but if he's not looking at you--

01:51:51.998 --> 01:51:53.009
LAURA: He'll see the gate.
TRAVIS: You can just show up

01:51:53.009 --> 01:51:54.632
in the middle of the room.

01:51:54.632 --> 01:51:55.652
SAM: Wait, is the gate invisible?

01:51:55.652 --> 01:51:57.051
LAURA: Jump out and surprise him, right now.

01:51:57.051 --> 01:51:58.650
TRAVIS: The gate is invisible.
LIAM: No, it's not.

01:51:58.650 --> 01:52:01.844
We dealt with that at the sanitorium.

01:52:01.844 --> 01:52:04.897
TRAVIS: No, the gate is invisible to the back.

01:52:04.897 --> 01:52:06.619
LIAM: One side?
TRAVIS: One side of it, yeah.

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:10.733
Now, if he can see magic, then he can see it,

01:52:10.733 --> 01:52:12.025
but it normally appears--

01:52:12.025 --> 01:52:13.695
SAM: If he's looking.
TRAVIS: If he's looking.

01:52:13.695 --> 01:52:16.223
LAURA: We could jump out and attack him right now.

01:52:16.223 --> 01:52:17.798
SAM: Maybe you could put, can you put the gate?

01:52:17.798 --> 01:52:20.087
Does it have to be on the floor?

01:52:20.087 --> 01:52:21.514
SAM: It does, right?
TRAVIS: It does.

01:52:21.514 --> 01:52:23.928
TALIESIN: Wrecked, wrecked.

01:52:23.928 --> 01:52:27.119
SAM: I can just invisible up and just peek through the door?

01:52:27.119 --> 01:52:28.452
TRAVIS: Yeah, do that.

01:52:29.899 --> 01:52:30.732
SAM: Yeah?

01:52:30.732 --> 01:52:31.915
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: We're going to let him get away.

01:52:31.915 --> 01:52:34.145
TRAVIS: There's nothing we gain by sitting here,

01:52:34.145 --> 01:52:35.412
and we only got a couple more minutes.

01:52:35.412 --> 01:52:38.189
LAURA: We should heal them really fast, heal them.

01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:39.022
We should heal them.

01:52:39.022 --> 01:52:41.736
ASHLEY: I can keep fighting, so.

01:52:41.736 --> 01:52:44.237
SAM: Are you healing or am I going?

01:52:44.237 --> 01:52:45.672
TRAVIS: What about the vials, the crystal vials,

01:52:45.672 --> 01:52:47.383
do they look like healing potions or something?

01:52:47.383 --> 01:52:48.400
MARISHA: Do they look like healing potions

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.671
or do they look like some other residuum magic?

01:52:50.671 --> 01:52:54.466
LIAM: Are they silvery like the possibility potions?

01:52:55.641 --> 01:52:58.756
MATT: You glance inside of the vials.

01:52:58.756 --> 01:53:02.337
Two of them appear to be healing potions

01:53:02.337 --> 01:53:03.170
of some kind.

01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:06.110
You're not too specifically aware of what they are.

01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:09.478
And one has a deep purple coloration to it.

01:53:09.478 --> 01:53:11.386
You're unfamiliar with what it may or may not be.

01:53:11.386 --> 01:53:14.232
MARISHA: I toss a healing potion to Yasha.

01:53:14.232 --> 01:53:16.109
TRAVIS: I'm at 97, anybody lower than that?

01:53:16.109 --> 01:53:17.474
MARISHA: I toss one to Fjord.

01:53:17.474 --> 01:53:18.765
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

01:53:18.765 --> 01:53:19.854
MARISHA: Oh.
LIAM: 50.

01:53:19.854 --> 01:53:22.014
TRAVIS: (panicked noise) I toss mine over to Caleb.

01:53:22.014 --> 01:53:22.947
MARISHA: Great.
MATT: They're both

01:53:22.947 --> 01:53:24.122
greater healing potions,

01:53:24.122 --> 01:53:27.512
so you heal 4d4 plus four.

01:53:27.512 --> 01:53:29.262
ASHLEY: 4d4 plus four, okay.

01:53:30.255 --> 01:53:31.507
TRAVIS: And you're lower than 97?

01:53:31.507 --> 01:53:32.556
TALIESIN: I'm 85.

01:53:32.556 --> 01:53:33.444
TRAVIS: Great.

01:53:33.444 --> 01:53:36.283
MARISHA: Have I seen this purply liquidy before?

01:53:36.283 --> 01:53:37.681
MATT: I don't believe so.

01:53:37.681 --> 01:53:39.013
ASHLEY: Oh, come on.

01:53:39.013 --> 01:53:40.224
MARISHA: Veth?
SAM: What?

01:53:40.224 --> 01:53:41.545
MARISHA: Does this look familiar to you?

01:53:41.545 --> 01:53:43.241
I toss it to Veth.

01:53:43.241 --> 01:53:44.666
Purple potion.
SAM: I look at it

01:53:44.666 --> 01:53:47.728
with my keen alchemical mind.

01:53:47.728 --> 01:53:49.357
(laughter)

01:53:49.357 --> 01:53:51.211
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

01:53:51.211 --> 01:53:52.378
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:53:54.017 --> 01:53:56.479
SAM: Eh, it looks purple.

01:53:56.479 --> 01:53:58.170
(laughter)

01:53:58.170 --> 01:53:59.211
LIAM: Is it the same hue--

01:53:59.211 --> 01:54:01.373
SAM: It's 10, I rolled a 10.
MATT: Yeah.

01:54:01.373 --> 01:54:05.703
LIAM: Same hue as the gems in the regen room?

01:54:05.703 --> 01:54:06.536
MATT: Darker.

01:54:06.536 --> 01:54:09.858
But purple all the same, yeah.

01:54:09.858 --> 01:54:11.350
SAM: Here, take this for later.

01:54:13.408 --> 01:54:15.100
I will turn invisible.

01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:18.160
I'll take out an eyelash wrapped in gum arabic

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:22.359
and smash it in my hand, waving it across the air,

01:54:22.359 --> 01:54:25.077
touching my forehead and pinching my nose,

01:54:25.077 --> 01:54:29.318
activating the Invisibility spell as I always do.

01:54:29.318 --> 01:54:32.922
(laughter)

01:54:32.922 --> 01:54:35.048
MATT: So you are now invisible and standing on the water.

01:54:35.048 --> 01:54:38.363
SAM: Yes, and I will army crawl along the water.

01:54:38.363 --> 01:54:40.260
(laughter)

01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:42.642
LIAM: Is the water going (bubbles)?

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:44.294
MATT: Go ahead and roll a stealth check with advantage,

01:54:44.294 --> 01:54:45.306
because you are invisible.

01:54:45.306 --> 01:54:47.989
LIAM: Seeing a Veth-shape

01:54:47.989 --> 01:54:50.264
snow angel.
SAM: Stealth.

01:54:50.264 --> 01:54:51.726
34.

01:54:51.726 --> 01:54:56.499
MATT: Okay. As you elbow your way

01:54:56.499 --> 01:54:58.874
into the space,

01:54:58.874 --> 01:55:01.961
you push past where the door opens.

01:55:01.961 --> 01:55:04.040
And the first thing that you notice

01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:08.198
is familiar teal light sources to your right and left,

01:55:08.198 --> 01:55:09.852
beyond the door.

01:55:09.852 --> 01:55:11.296
There is an intuit charge

01:55:11.296 --> 01:55:14.343
maybe two feet to your right and two feet to your left.

01:55:14.343 --> 01:55:15.559
Both just glowing and

01:55:15.559 --> 01:55:17.168
slowly rotating.
SAM: They didn't go off?

01:55:17.168 --> 01:55:18.730
MATT: They have not gone off.

01:55:18.730 --> 01:55:21.192
SAM: Oh, because they're being-- they're not proximity.

01:55:21.192 --> 01:55:23.250
MARISHA: They're manually triggered.

01:55:23.250 --> 01:55:25.013
LIAM: Yep.
MARISHA: This is an ambush!

01:55:25.013 --> 01:55:26.297
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Yep.

01:55:26.297 --> 01:55:28.253
MATT: Looking into the room further, from what you can tell,

01:55:28.253 --> 01:55:29.246
make a perception check for me.

01:55:29.246 --> 01:55:30.961
SAM: I'm not good at those.

01:55:30.961 --> 01:55:33.719
But 19 anyway.

01:55:33.719 --> 01:55:35.413
MATT: Okay, okay!

01:55:37.475 --> 01:55:38.725
You can see now

01:55:40.827 --> 01:55:43.466
ceiling panels have fallen

01:55:43.466 --> 01:55:45.506
in a few places here and cables dangle

01:55:45.506 --> 01:55:47.197
and chain elements are affixed

01:55:47.197 --> 01:55:49.354
to parts of the walls around you.

01:55:49.354 --> 01:55:53.941
But this is probably a massive 90- to a 100-foot chamber.

01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:56.909
The center of it has a mostly roundish,

01:55:56.909 --> 01:55:59.892
cylindrical construction, aside from three offshoot alcoves

01:55:59.892 --> 01:56:01.789
of which this is one that you're in,

01:56:01.789 --> 01:56:04.503
where this hallway enters into.

01:56:04.503 --> 01:56:06.898
The mist hangs on everything here,

01:56:06.898 --> 01:56:09.553
and you can see the source of the mist

01:56:09.553 --> 01:56:11.565
as well as the source of the water.

01:56:11.565 --> 01:56:13.948
For in the middle of this cylindrical chamber,

01:56:13.948 --> 01:56:16.516
there is a raised series of stairs

01:56:16.516 --> 01:56:18.897
and a dais in the center where you can see

01:56:18.897 --> 01:56:22.474
other elements of mechanical arcane contraptions

01:56:22.474 --> 01:56:25.437
with glowing runes that are affixed to

01:56:25.437 --> 01:56:27.895
a large, 10-foot wide ring

01:56:27.895 --> 01:56:29.803
that stands the top center of this platform,

01:56:29.803 --> 01:56:33.245
about 10 feet side-to-side.

01:56:33.245 --> 01:56:34.294
SAM: A stargate?

01:56:34.294 --> 01:56:35.454
MATT: Essentially.
SAM: Okay.

01:56:35.454 --> 01:56:38.725
MATT: An arcane stargate.

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:41.392
In the middle of it, there is a very fine blue,

01:56:41.392 --> 01:56:45.257
glowing, crackling line, like a mostly-shut eye.

01:56:45.257 --> 01:56:48.900
And from it, weeping, is just water--

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:49.733
SAM: Cool!

01:56:49.733 --> 01:56:52.712
MATT: -- and mist drifting out.

01:56:53.552 --> 01:56:56.276
You immediately can see this is the source of all the water

01:56:56.276 --> 01:56:58.107
flooding this chamber,

01:56:58.107 --> 01:57:02.274
as well as the mist obscuring the top three or so feet

01:57:02.274 --> 01:57:04.000
of this entire room.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.650
SAM: And aside from the intuit charges,

01:57:07.650 --> 01:57:10.429
which are giving off this pale glow,

01:57:10.429 --> 01:57:14.112
yellow and blue light is coming from the--

01:57:14.112 --> 01:57:16.942
MATT: Blue light is coming the Immensus Gate--

01:57:16.942 --> 01:57:18.460
SAM: Immensus Gate.
MATT: -- in the center of the chamber.

01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:20.225
The yellow light is coming from similar

01:57:20.225 --> 01:57:21.711
affixed light sources in the ceiling

01:57:21.711 --> 01:57:23.461
from previous chambers you've been in.

01:57:23.461 --> 01:57:26.063
You do see along the walls,

01:57:26.063 --> 01:57:30.962
other tables and laboratory elements,

01:57:30.962 --> 01:57:32.975
similar to previous places you've explored

01:57:32.975 --> 01:57:35.159
and other elements of Aeor and other ruins,

01:57:35.159 --> 01:57:38.740
though arranged differently within the interior here.

01:57:39.615 --> 01:57:41.866
There's elements of metal carts and cracked debris

01:57:41.866 --> 01:57:43.694
that are lodged where the water source has

01:57:43.694 --> 01:57:44.758
pushed them out to the side.

01:57:44.758 --> 01:57:46.577
So a lot of the furniture has been shoved

01:57:46.577 --> 01:57:50.006
to the exterior walls of the room.

01:57:50.939 --> 01:57:55.939
You can also tell within the center of this raised platform,

01:57:56.211 --> 01:57:57.921
talking and darting amongst the materials

01:57:57.921 --> 01:57:59.888
are two humanoid figures

01:57:59.888 --> 01:58:02.075
that are in the process of adjusting things

01:58:02.075 --> 01:58:03.043
and moving things about.

01:58:03.043 --> 01:58:05.563
SAM: Close to the gate, or--?

01:58:05.563 --> 01:58:06.522
MATT: Very close to the gate.

01:58:06.522 --> 01:58:10.182
SAM: Okay, I'll back up immediately.

01:58:10.182 --> 01:58:12.042
Reverse army crawl.

01:58:12.042 --> 01:58:14.772
TRAVIS: Just throwing it out there, it's waist-high water.

01:58:14.772 --> 01:58:16.027
We have underwater breathing,

01:58:16.027 --> 01:58:18.611
if we wanted to go under the water as we went in,

01:58:18.611 --> 01:58:19.478
just a thought.

01:58:19.478 --> 01:58:21.295
LAURA: How would we take out the intuit charges?

01:58:21.295 --> 01:58:23.675
Sneak in and dispel them really fast

01:58:23.675 --> 01:58:25.333
before they realized that we've--

01:58:25.333 --> 01:58:27.016
TRAVIS: Those are the only two we saw.

01:58:27.016 --> 01:58:27.890
LAURA: Yeah.

01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:29.989
TALIESIN: I feel we would be able to,

01:58:29.989 --> 01:58:31.969
unless they had more hidden?

01:58:31.969 --> 01:58:33.356
SAM: Why would they hide more?

01:58:33.356 --> 01:58:36.482
TRAVIS: Lucien will smoke Cree.

01:58:36.482 --> 01:58:37.818
SAM: Yeah. In a second.
TRAVIS: And us.

01:58:37.818 --> 01:58:38.976
MARISHA: Yeah, he won't care.

01:58:40.836 --> 01:58:43.511
SAM: Okay, so I go back, oh my god.

01:58:43.511 --> 01:58:45.844
How far back are my friends?

01:58:47.559 --> 01:58:50.008
MATT: They're about, maybe 20 or so feet.

01:58:50.008 --> 01:58:50.841
You guys probably wouldn't have gotten any

01:58:50.841 --> 01:58:51.763
farther than that.

01:58:51.763 --> 01:58:53.105
SAM: I don't want to make any noise,

01:58:53.105 --> 01:58:56.522
so wave everyone further back,

01:58:56.522 --> 01:58:59.615
just so we don't make any noise.

01:58:59.615 --> 01:59:03.899
And I'll whisper what I saw to the crew

01:59:04.856 --> 01:59:06.990
using a lot of hand gestures.

01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:08.809
TRAVIS: Do we have time for a Heroes' Feast?

01:59:08.809 --> 01:59:10.375
I don't think we can wait an hour.
LAURA: We can't wait an hour.

01:59:10.375 --> 01:59:13.625
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just making sure we said it.

01:59:15.213 --> 01:59:18.266
LIAM: We're all clumped up within sight of these charges,

01:59:18.266 --> 01:59:19.319
that Veth located?

01:59:19.319 --> 01:59:21.000
MATT: No, you don't have sight.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.800
In order to see them, you'd have to step into the chamber.

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.633
TRAVIS: They did the same thing we did.

01:59:23.633 --> 01:59:25.686
They're on the inside of the door.

01:59:25.686 --> 01:59:26.646
LAURA: So we'd have to--

01:59:26.646 --> 01:59:27.796
MATT: Looks like they learned from you.

01:59:27.796 --> 01:59:31.029
LAURA: Can we do the Orb of Invulnerability

01:59:31.029 --> 01:59:33.159
and walk in, so they set them off and it doesn't affect us,

01:59:33.159 --> 01:59:34.878
and then we attack?

01:59:34.878 --> 01:59:38.738
MARISHA: Is that orb protected against psychic damage,

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:40.328
or is it just physical?

01:59:40.328 --> 01:59:42.215
LAURA: I don't know.
LIAM: It's spells.

01:59:42.215 --> 01:59:44.370
LAURA: It's spells.
LIAM: Of a certain level.

01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:45.203
MARISHA: Spells.

01:59:45.203 --> 01:59:46.458
TRAVIS: Instead of effects,

01:59:46.458 --> 01:59:47.291
it could be that--

01:59:47.291 --> 01:59:48.408
SAM: The duplicate could-- well, no,

01:59:48.408 --> 01:59:49.275
it would still go off.

01:59:49.275 --> 01:59:51.438
I mean, if they go off and we're anywhere close,

01:59:51.438 --> 01:59:52.812
we still get hit.
LAURA: 300 feet.

01:59:52.812 --> 01:59:53.937
TRAVIS: In our entire arsenal,

01:59:53.937 --> 01:59:56.987
how many Dispels do we have left between the three of you?

01:59:56.987 --> 01:59:57.886
LAURA: A lot.
TALIESIN: A lot.

01:59:57.886 --> 02:00:00.441
LAURA: So I could go in. I could sneak in underwater;

02:00:00.441 --> 02:00:02.705
if you give me underwater breathing.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:00:02.705 --> 02:00:04.162
TALIESIN: We both have it.
We can do it on the count of three.

02:00:04.162 --> 02:00:06.938
LAURA: We could swim in below.
TALIESIN: Knock them both out.

02:00:06.938 --> 02:00:09.778
LAURA: Do it and bamf them out.

02:00:09.778 --> 02:00:11.234
LIAM: We also can't use the globe.

02:00:11.234 --> 02:00:14.416
We fudged the rules last time; the globe doesn't travel.

02:00:14.416 --> 02:00:15.899
TRAVIS: Right, okay.
LIAM: It's stationary.

02:00:15.899 --> 02:00:17.292
LAURA: Oh, good to know.

02:00:17.292 --> 02:00:18.744
TRAVIS: So ballpark the Dispels, though,

02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:22.186
just in case we're only seeing two of six or eight.

02:00:22.186 --> 02:00:23.628
How many do you have, how many do you have,

02:00:23.628 --> 02:00:24.792
how many do you have?

02:00:24.792 --> 02:00:26.967
If you needed to max out your Dispels.

02:00:26.967 --> 02:00:27.952
LAURA: I mean, a ton.

02:00:27.952 --> 02:00:28.785
SAM: We also established--

02:00:28.785 --> 02:00:31.635
TRAVIS: A ton is what, four? Five? Six?

02:00:31.635 --> 02:00:35.217
LAURA: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

02:00:35.217 --> 02:00:36.755
TRAVIS: At least 4th-level?

02:00:36.755 --> 02:00:37.609
TALIESIN: Oh.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:38.442
LAURA: Oh.

02:00:38.442 --> 02:00:39.706
TALIESIN: Two, four.

02:00:39.706 --> 02:00:41.446
TRAVIS: That's the one that had success from Caleb.

02:00:41.446 --> 02:00:42.504
TALIESIN and LAURA: Six.

02:00:42.504 --> 02:00:44.921
LIAM: Five, if we're doing 4th and higher.

02:00:44.921 --> 02:00:46.572
TRAVIS: Five.

02:00:46.572 --> 02:00:47.638
LAURA and TALIESIN: Same.

02:00:47.638 --> 02:00:49.063
MATT: As you're having this discussion--

02:00:49.063 --> 02:00:49.896
TRAVIS: Fuck!
MATT: Caleb.

02:00:49.896 --> 02:00:50.904
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.
MATT: Beauregard.

02:00:50.904 --> 02:00:51.870
MARISHA: Son of a bitch,

02:00:51.870 --> 02:00:54.994
he knows we're here.

02:00:54.994 --> 02:00:56.765
MATT: A voice creeps into your minds.

02:00:56.765 --> 02:00:57.681
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:00:59.034 --> 02:01:01.778
MATT: "I was wondering when I'd sense your closure.

02:01:01.778 --> 02:01:04.946
"Oh, don't be shy. Let's have a conversation.

02:01:04.946 --> 02:01:08.015
"I've made some precautions, but

02:01:08.015 --> 02:01:11.640
"I think it's worth a talk, right?"

02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:15.037
That's all you hear.

02:01:16.545 --> 02:01:18.109
TRAVIS: Time for y'all to go.

02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:19.692
LIAM: What'd you say?

02:01:21.236 --> 02:01:23.931
TRAVIS: He senses you.

02:01:23.931 --> 02:01:24.764
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:01:28.241 --> 02:01:30.453
SAM: You want to send them in solo?

02:01:30.453 --> 02:01:31.792
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:01:31.792 --> 02:01:33.448
MARISHA: We could send us in, we could start talking

02:01:33.448 --> 02:01:35.281
while you guys set up.

02:01:36.923 --> 02:01:38.898
SAM: If you did that,

02:01:38.898 --> 02:01:42.523
how many hit points do you have?

02:01:43.810 --> 02:01:45.106
We'd want to be sure

02:01:45.106 --> 02:01:47.640
that you can take a full blast hit.

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.162
TRAVIS: Yeah, the only part of this plan

02:01:49.162 --> 02:01:50.725
we're talking about is you two walk in.

02:01:50.725 --> 02:01:51.558
SAM: 100 points.

02:01:51.558 --> 02:01:53.734
TRAVIS: Coming up with a story, how the two of you survived

02:01:53.734 --> 02:01:55.856
and we didn't and the rest of us are underwater

02:01:55.856 --> 02:01:58.745
so that you two can hit the intuit charges.

02:01:58.745 --> 02:02:01.749
I don't have anything after that,

02:02:01.749 --> 02:02:03.587
because we don't see any other intuit charges.

02:02:03.587 --> 02:02:06.436
ASHLEY: Is there any way he could know that we're all here?

02:02:06.436 --> 02:02:09.118
SAM: I assume he knows we travel together.

02:02:09.118 --> 02:02:11.083
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:02:11.083 --> 02:02:13.528
LIAM: Yeah, he's not going to
believe that you guys are gone.

02:02:13.528 --> 02:02:14.361
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:02:14.361 --> 02:02:16.331
LIAM: Also, if those both go off, I'm down.

02:02:16.331 --> 02:02:20.164
TALIESIN: We're all down if those both go off.
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all down.

02:02:21.031 --> 02:02:22.447
ASHLEY: I could just rage

02:02:22.447 --> 02:02:24.538
and then run in there and set them off.

02:02:25.496 --> 02:02:26.777
TRAVIS: We're within 300 feet.

02:02:26.777 --> 02:02:28.984
SAM: Yeah, but we could back up.

02:02:28.984 --> 02:02:31.068
TALIESIN: We can't back that far up.

02:02:31.068 --> 02:02:32.190
SAM: Sure we can.

02:02:32.190 --> 02:02:33.471
TALIESIN: It's very far.

02:02:33.471 --> 02:02:35.799
If you rage and get--

02:02:35.799 --> 02:02:37.082
TRAVIS: It'll kill you.

02:02:37.082 --> 02:02:38.443
TALIESIN: It'll kill you once you-- because you're--

02:02:38.443 --> 02:02:40.089
LAURA: Yeah, she can't die.

02:02:40.089 --> 02:02:41.935
LIAM: It'll surpass your total.

02:02:41.935 --> 02:02:42.768
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:02:42.768 --> 02:02:43.918
TALIESIN: Yeah, way past.

02:02:43.918 --> 02:02:45.531
MARISHA: I do have a feeling he's probably set it

02:02:45.531 --> 02:02:47.299
to where it's got to be triggered.

02:02:47.299 --> 02:02:48.646
SAM: Yeah, of course.

02:02:48.646 --> 02:02:50.639
TALIESIN: We'd already be dead.
LIAM: It would have gone off by now.

02:02:50.639 --> 02:02:52.551
Well--
SAM: Yes.

02:02:52.551 --> 02:02:53.767
LIAM: How far away in feet?
MARISHA: 60 feet.

02:02:53.767 --> 02:02:55.640
SAM: I was within 10 feet.

02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:57.270
MATT: Yeah, Nott was within 10 feet of each of them.

02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:59.020
LIAM: You were right there.

02:03:00.815 --> 02:03:02.515
LAURA: You want to go in and talk?

02:03:02.515 --> 02:03:04.708
TRAVIS: I mean, the options are sneaky and try to Dispel,

02:03:04.708 --> 02:03:07.780
or we talk our way into this poker game.

02:03:08.772 --> 02:03:10.264
TALIESIN: I don't think we have a choice.

02:03:10.264 --> 02:03:11.097
I don't think there's any--

02:03:11.097 --> 02:03:13.476
You can't be sneaky once they've invited you in.

02:03:13.476 --> 02:03:16.059
LAURA: We can be sneaky, they can't.

02:03:18.092 --> 02:03:21.953
LIAM: Well, he can sense us, but he can't--

02:03:21.953 --> 02:03:24.040
maybe he can't see us.

02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:28.325
You could send me and then I could Dispel those things

02:03:28.325 --> 02:03:29.848
from under the surface of the water

02:03:29.848 --> 02:03:32.346
and at least get the two.

02:03:32.346 --> 02:03:34.536
MATT: At about this time,

02:03:34.536 --> 02:03:39.300
the light flickers a bit through the mist.

02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:41.993
And you hear a voice echo from
within the chamber and it goes,

02:03:41.993 --> 02:03:44.008
(as Cree) "Ah, I think I've got it."

02:03:44.008 --> 02:03:44.916
LAURA: Go, just go.

02:03:44.916 --> 02:03:47.863
MATT: And you hear Lucien respond,

02:03:47.863 --> 02:03:50.370
"Shh, wait,

02:03:50.370 --> 02:03:51.936
"we've got company.

02:03:51.936 --> 02:03:54.964
"We don't want to be as impolite as they've been."

02:03:56.006 --> 02:03:57.128
LIAM: All right, I'm doing--

02:03:57.128 --> 02:03:58.891
SAM: I think, if Caleb and Beau go in,

02:03:58.891 --> 02:04:01.565
he's just going to be like, "Where are your friends?"

02:04:01.565 --> 02:04:02.398
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:04:02.398 --> 02:04:04.096
LAURA: Regardless, we have to fucking do something.

02:04:04.096 --> 02:04:06.316
MARISHA: Even if that, "Where are our friends?"

02:04:06.316 --> 02:04:09.617
gives us six seconds in order to Dispel those,

02:04:09.617 --> 02:04:11.675
even if it gives us a--
LIAM: Let me just get those two things.

02:04:11.675 --> 02:04:13.636
You send me underwater, all of us,

02:04:13.636 --> 02:04:14.878
give us all the ability.

02:04:14.878 --> 02:04:16.752
TRAVIS: I just cast Underwater Breathing on all of us.

02:04:16.752 --> 02:04:17.960
24 hours, done.

02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.920
You can do with it what you will.

02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:23.337
LIAM: I'm going to glide up under the surface

02:04:23.337 --> 02:04:24.593
and try to hit--
TRAVIS: I cast the Water Breathing.

02:04:24.593 --> 02:04:25.426
MATT: Okay.

02:04:25.426 --> 02:04:27.159
TRAVIS: Do I need to--

02:04:27.159 --> 02:04:28.909
Nine.
MATT: Okay.

02:04:28.909 --> 02:04:30.037
LAURA: I'm going to

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:33.017
Invoke Duplicity.

02:04:34.447 --> 02:04:36.411
I know that he'll probably be able to see it,

02:04:36.411 --> 02:04:37.898
but I'm going to just shuffle her in

02:04:37.898 --> 02:04:39.620
with the other people and hopefully

02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:40.999
it won't be as noticeable,

02:04:40.999 --> 02:04:42.166
and I'm going to go underwater

02:04:42.166 --> 02:04:44.021
while she walks with everybody.

02:04:44.021 --> 02:04:44.854
MATT: Okay.

02:04:46.464 --> 02:04:49.556
So you're going underwater

02:04:49.556 --> 02:04:53.038
while sending your duplicate with the rest of the troop.

02:04:53.038 --> 02:04:54.360
LIAM: I'm going to go ahead of the group.

02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.201
MATT: Okay.

02:04:55.201 --> 02:04:56.799
MARISHA: And I'll go ahead with you.

02:04:56.799 --> 02:04:57.632
MATT: All right.

02:04:57.632 --> 02:04:59.117
MARISHA: Caleb and Beau are walking in.

02:04:59.117 --> 02:05:00.208
MATT: Caleb and Beau.

02:05:00.208 --> 02:05:01.330
LIAM: Underwater.
SAM: I'm invisible.

02:05:01.330 --> 02:05:03.092
MARISHA: Underwater.

02:05:03.092 --> 02:05:04.839
ASHLEY: I'm right behind them, as well.

02:05:04.839 --> 02:05:06.645
LIAM: Get rid of at least these two charges

02:05:06.645 --> 02:05:08.700
before discussion begins.

02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:09.983
We can pop up out of the water.

02:05:09.983 --> 02:05:11.546
MARISHA: You get rid of them, I'll be watching.

02:05:11.546 --> 02:05:12.812
LIAM: Okay.

02:05:12.812 --> 02:05:13.719
MATT: All right.

02:05:13.719 --> 02:05:17.119
As you all begin to step towards the chamber

02:05:17.119 --> 02:05:19.057
to figure out how this interaction

02:05:19.057 --> 02:05:22.178
at the Immensus Gate is to transpire,

02:05:22.178 --> 02:05:23.013
we're going to take a break.

02:05:23.013 --> 02:05:23.846
SAM: Ah!
LIAM: Ooh.

02:05:23.846 --> 02:05:26.989
MARISHA: Instant sweat.
ASHLEY: Uh-huh.

02:05:26.989 --> 02:05:28.340
LIAM: We're bugs on a windshield.

02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:29.581
TRAVIS: I'm loving it!

02:05:29.581 --> 02:05:30.556
TALIESIN: We're so fucked.

02:05:30.556 --> 02:05:32.222
MATT: We're going to be right back here in a few minutes

02:05:32.222 --> 02:05:35.546
to see how this happens. (laughs)

02:05:35.546 --> 02:05:37.051
All right, see you guys in a minute.

02:05:38.092 --> 02:05:41.111
(fire crackles)

02:05:41.111 --> 02:05:43.463
(groans)

02:05:43.463 --> 02:05:44.546
Dwarvenite.

02:05:46.194 --> 02:05:50.027
The most precious substance among dwarven smiths.

02:05:51.924 --> 02:05:55.641
Able to absorb the very spirit of the craftsmen.

02:05:59.128 --> 02:06:02.216
(electrical crackle)

02:06:02.216 --> 02:06:06.287
Thus enthused, it becomes nearly indestructible.

02:06:09.654 --> 02:06:13.117
Able to forge heirlooms that will last for generations.

02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:16.113
(roars)

02:06:16.113 --> 02:06:18.863
(flames explode)

02:06:24.219 --> 02:06:25.552
Pure dwarvenite.

02:06:26.831 --> 02:06:28.494
Now you can get your hands

02:06:28.494 --> 02:06:31.674
on this legendary substance,

02:06:31.674 --> 02:06:34.074
with the new Dungeon of Doom.

02:06:36.212 --> 02:06:39.753
Available now at dwarvenforge.com

02:06:39.753 --> 02:06:42.420
(flames whoosh)

02:07:15.874 --> 02:07:18.433
Oh I can't wait to give Taliesin hugs.

02:07:18.433 --> 02:07:19.321
I know.

02:07:19.321 --> 02:07:21.962
I know.
I've missed him so much.

02:07:21.962 --> 02:07:23.751
Well, over a year now.

02:07:23.751 --> 02:07:24.924
(groaning)

02:07:24.924 --> 02:07:25.794
Well over a year.

02:07:25.794 --> 02:07:27.371
Taliesin, I think, you were my last hug.

02:07:27.371 --> 02:07:28.514
Was I your last hug?

02:07:28.514 --> 02:07:29.994
I think you were my very last hug.

02:07:29.994 --> 02:07:30.827
Oh god.

02:07:30.827 --> 02:07:31.764
Aww.

02:07:31.764 --> 02:07:33.414
I was thinking about it the other day,

02:07:33.414 --> 02:07:36.084
I'm pretty sure you were the last person I hugged.

02:07:36.084 --> 02:07:37.314
Oh man.

02:07:37.314 --> 02:07:38.147
So.

02:07:38.147 --> 02:07:41.404
My last hug was definitely that flight attendant

02:07:41.404 --> 02:07:42.907
as she threw me out.

02:07:44.174 --> 02:07:46.507
Coming back from wherever we were.

02:07:47.694 --> 02:07:49.229
All right, the question was--

02:07:49.229 --> 02:07:52.062
(everyone laughs)

02:07:53.789 --> 02:07:55.567
She doesn't wanna tell that story.

02:07:55.567 --> 02:07:57.699
(laughs)

02:07:57.699 --> 02:08:00.924
I love that nobody does anything anymore.

02:08:00.924 --> 02:08:01.917
We just stare.

02:08:32.904 --> 02:08:33.764
Hey critters.

02:08:33.764 --> 02:08:35.004
Laura Bailey here.

02:08:35.004 --> 02:08:37.437
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:08:39.318 --> 02:08:40.914
Oh, look at this.

02:08:40.914 --> 02:08:42.631
Look at the details, oh.

02:08:45.524 --> 02:08:46.674
Oh my gosh.

02:08:46.674 --> 02:08:48.367
It's so amazing.

02:08:51.354 --> 02:08:53.764
Can you put donuts in this?

02:08:53.764 --> 02:08:55.421
Only one way to find out.

02:08:58.150 --> 02:08:59.118
The cuteness!

02:08:59.118 --> 02:09:00.169
It's...

02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:01.502
...overpowering.

02:09:03.477 --> 02:09:05.114
I mean, the traveler always says

02:09:05.114 --> 02:09:07.427
impulse purchases are a good decision.

02:09:09.824 --> 02:09:12.117
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:09:12.984 --> 02:09:14.754
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:09:14.754 --> 02:09:15.704
You still got time!

02:09:21.637 --> 02:09:24.387
(birds chirping)

02:09:26.974 --> 02:09:29.114
I'm a fan of hot air balloon rides

02:09:29.114 --> 02:09:31.077
above the Venetian countryside.

02:09:32.624 --> 02:09:34.094
I'm a fan of Momlyn,

02:09:34.094 --> 02:09:35.947
she's always got my back.

02:09:37.104 --> 02:09:39.517
I'm a fan of wine older than Taliesin.

02:09:42.454 --> 02:09:44.497
I'm a fan of Twitch subscriptions.

02:09:46.644 --> 02:09:49.244
I'm a fan of emotes by Arsequeef.

02:09:49.244 --> 02:09:50.077
They're neat.

02:09:51.137 --> 02:09:54.847
I'm a fan of a wife, so cool people forget, I exist.

02:09:56.078 --> 02:09:59.066
(distorted noises)

02:09:59.066 --> 02:10:01.660
(elephant bellowing)

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.138
(loud explosion)

02:10:03.138 --> 02:10:05.805
(robotic noise)

02:10:13.812 --> 02:10:16.431
(baby crying)

02:10:16.431 --> 02:10:19.681
(heart beating loudly)

02:10:22.090 --> 02:10:23.340
I'm a fan of...

02:10:24.334 --> 02:10:26.707
...wearing your skin as a mask.

02:23:24.654 --> 02:23:26.413
MATT: And welcome back.

02:23:26.413 --> 02:23:29.843
So, last we left off,

02:23:29.843 --> 02:23:32.615
you were deciding-- whoa, after I dropped something--

02:23:32.615 --> 02:23:35.365
You were deciding what to do

02:23:35.365 --> 02:23:38.364
as you're seemingly sensed

02:23:38.364 --> 02:23:43.364
and invited to come talk with Lucien and Cree

02:23:43.884 --> 02:23:46.884
within the Immensus Gate chamber.

02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:50.476
What would you like to do?

02:23:51.736 --> 02:23:53.939
SAM: Here's my plan.

02:23:53.939 --> 02:23:55.090
We're all cows.

02:23:55.090 --> 02:23:55.923
(laughter)

02:23:55.923 --> 02:23:57.840
TRAVIS: Thank you, thank you.

02:23:59.199 --> 02:24:00.858
MARISHA: It kind of works.
TRAVIS: Where's a druid

02:24:00.858 --> 02:24:03.300
when you need it? We could be killer whales.

02:24:05.464 --> 02:24:08.527
LAURA: I mean, we said Caleb was going underwater.

02:24:08.527 --> 02:24:09.637
I was going underwater.

02:24:09.637 --> 02:24:10.735
Anybody else going underwater?

02:24:10.735 --> 02:24:12.847
SAM: I was going to sneak behind you guys, invisible.

02:24:12.847 --> 02:24:13.680
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:16.207
MARISHA: And I'm the mouthpiece to start us off?

02:24:16.207 --> 02:24:18.097
SAM: Ooh. We're dead.
MARISHA: I know.

02:24:18.097 --> 02:24:19.695
We're so dead.

02:24:19.695 --> 02:24:20.986
ASHLEY: She's wonderful!

02:24:20.986 --> 02:24:25.710
MATT: So Caleb and Beau up front with Veth sneaking

02:24:25.710 --> 02:24:27.245
underwater or on top of water.

02:24:27.245 --> 02:24:28.891
SAM: On top of the water, I'm still invisible

02:24:28.891 --> 02:24:29.778
for a bit longer.
MATT: Right.

02:24:29.778 --> 02:24:32.244
MARISHA: Admittedly, the worst thing that I'm at.
LAURA: I'm underwater.

02:24:32.244 --> 02:24:33.559
MATT: Jester's underwater.

02:24:33.559 --> 02:24:35.542
LAURA: I'm underwater right behind--

02:24:35.542 --> 02:24:36.971
SAM: (claps) Focus!

02:24:36.971 --> 02:24:39.079
MATT: Right behind?
LAURA: Right behind Beau.

02:24:39.079 --> 02:24:40.611
I'm potentially, if--
MARISHA: My innate ability to just

02:24:40.611 --> 02:24:42.389
charm the pants off people.

02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:45.932
LAURA: If Caleb is right behind,
because you said you were going to

02:24:45.932 --> 02:24:47.500
hang back just behind Beau?

02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:50.267
LIAM: I was going to just be
right at her ankle, essentially.

02:24:50.267 --> 02:24:51.100
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:51.933
MATT: All righty.

02:24:51.933 --> 02:24:53.808
LAURA: He's under water.
LIAM: Like a triangle we could do.

02:24:53.808 --> 02:24:54.928
MATT: So you're underwater as well, Caleb?

02:24:54.928 --> 02:24:58.401
LIAM: Yeah, yes, V-formation.
MATT: All right, got it. So Beau--

02:24:58.401 --> 02:25:00.876
LAURA: And I would be right next to Caleb then, underwater.

02:25:00.876 --> 02:25:02.594
MATT: Okay, you got it.

02:25:02.594 --> 02:25:04.998
Veth's on the water, who's up next?

02:25:04.998 --> 02:25:07.451
TALIESIN: I suppose it would be me.

02:25:07.451 --> 02:25:08.303
MATT: All righty.

02:25:08.303 --> 02:25:10.236
ASHLEY: I'll go next.

02:25:11.196 --> 02:25:12.836
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: (whispering) Why are we doing this?

02:25:12.836 --> 02:25:17.644
LAURA: And my duplicate is walking

02:25:17.644 --> 02:25:19.427
between Yasha and Caduceus.

02:25:19.427 --> 02:25:23.285
TALIESIN: They're clearly identifiable to someone
who has Detect Magic and can see though--

02:25:23.285 --> 02:25:25.753
LAURA: Sure, yeah, but-- I mean, if you're paying attention,

02:25:25.753 --> 02:25:27.713
but if she's just walking amidst everybody,

02:25:27.713 --> 02:25:29.605
hopefully, she'll just--
ASHLEY: Blend in.

02:25:29.605 --> 02:25:31.902
LAURA: -- look like she's there, you know what I mean?

02:25:31.902 --> 02:25:32.735
LIAM: Maybe.
MATT: Sure.

02:25:32.735 --> 02:25:33.568
TALIESIN: Could be.

02:25:33.568 --> 02:25:38.349
ASHLEY: And I'll try to, you know, make myself bigger.

02:25:38.349 --> 02:25:40.142
TRAVIS: Please explain what that was.

02:25:40.142 --> 02:25:41.913
ASHLEY: I'm making myself bigger.

02:25:41.913 --> 02:25:43.903
You know, covering her a little bit.

02:25:43.903 --> 02:25:45.232
TRAVIS: Look over here!

02:25:45.232 --> 02:25:49.627
MATT: Like one of those little desert frogs that puffs up?

02:25:49.627 --> 02:25:50.943
All right.

02:25:50.943 --> 02:25:52.444
(laughter)

02:25:52.444 --> 02:25:53.277
TRAVIS: (crocks)
LIAM: Yes.

02:25:53.277 --> 02:25:55.615
LAURA: We're trying it?

02:25:55.615 --> 02:25:58.874
MATT: So, you're in formation.

02:25:58.874 --> 02:26:01.107
MARISHA: (nervous sounds)

02:26:01.107 --> 02:26:05.707
TRAVIS: You got it, you got it, it's going to go great.

02:26:05.707 --> 02:26:07.578
MARISHA: I'm playing a--
TRAVIS: We hold all the cards.

02:26:07.578 --> 02:26:09.402
MARISHA: -- 20 charisma character next game.

02:26:09.402 --> 02:26:10.648
Okay, let's go.

02:26:10.648 --> 02:26:13.910
LIAM: I think what I would do is wait underwater

02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:18.305
and when I hear the vibration of Beauregard's voice

02:26:18.305 --> 02:26:21.442
is when I would fire off Dispel.

02:26:21.442 --> 02:26:23.020
MATT: Okay.

02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:25.160
So you all enter the chamber

02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:27.861
or begin to step into the space.

02:26:27.861 --> 02:26:29.500
MARISHA: But I'm just walking.

02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:33.167
MATT: With Jester and Caleb underwater.

02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:36.969
Beauregard, you begin to walk in

02:26:36.969 --> 02:26:41.969
and you see the mist still gathered across

02:26:42.502 --> 02:26:45.331
the surface of the water as you (splashing),

02:26:45.331 --> 02:26:46.852
with the sound of all the people behind

02:26:46.852 --> 02:26:51.852
(splashing) marching your way through the water.

02:26:52.337 --> 02:26:55.351
At which point, you see the two figures at the top,

02:26:55.351 --> 02:27:00.018
the sparking, glowing, and occasionally

02:27:00.018 --> 02:27:03.311
flashing line of energy in the center of this large,

02:27:03.311 --> 02:27:05.876
metallic, empty ring.

02:27:05.876 --> 02:27:09.209
And as you begin to step in, Beauregard,

02:27:10.430 --> 02:27:13.150
one of the figures turns around and, though

02:27:13.150 --> 02:27:16.494
you cannot see the face so much, the light source

02:27:16.494 --> 02:27:19.589
in here is very faint, other than the faint

02:27:19.589 --> 02:27:22.356
glow from the ring behind them

02:27:22.356 --> 02:27:24.106
that's giving them this back-lit appearance

02:27:24.106 --> 02:27:25.226
and just the front of shadow,

02:27:25.226 --> 02:27:27.826
you can tell from the outline, that it's Lucien.

02:27:27.826 --> 02:27:30.327
Also, because while you just see a shadow in the front,

02:27:30.327 --> 02:27:33.218
you see a number of red eyes that seem to be glowing

02:27:33.218 --> 02:27:36.418
from within the shadow across what parts of him are visible.

02:27:36.418 --> 02:27:38.711
LIAM: As she's taking that in, in your brain,

02:27:38.711 --> 02:27:42.044
you hear, "We believe in you."

02:27:46.151 --> 02:27:47.965
MARISHA: (groans)

02:27:47.965 --> 02:27:52.012
MATT: You step in and with Lucien turned around, he goes,

02:27:52.012 --> 02:27:54.375
"I think that's far enough,

02:27:54.375 --> 02:27:57.018
"for I've my thoughts on turnabout

02:27:57.018 --> 02:27:59.998
"should you take another step."

02:27:59.998 --> 02:28:00.831
MARISHA: I stop.

02:28:02.087 --> 02:28:03.454
MATT: "You may have to just twiddle the finger.

02:28:03.454 --> 02:28:08.014
"I know how you figured these little scramblers work,

02:28:08.014 --> 02:28:10.326
"seeing as how you murdered most of our crew with them,

02:28:10.326 --> 02:28:13.119
"so you know that if I think

02:28:13.119 --> 02:28:16.214
"so much as a greener color shade.

02:28:16.214 --> 02:28:17.498
"You all go.

02:28:18.807 --> 02:28:21.832
"And you bleed from every memory."

02:28:26.159 --> 02:28:27.550
TALIESIN: Color shade...

02:28:28.646 --> 02:28:31.163
SAM: Are we inside the threshold or is Beau in?

02:28:31.163 --> 02:28:33.542
MATT: Beauregard has stepped into the threshold

02:28:33.542 --> 02:28:36.138
and seems to have stopped. The rest of you are

02:28:36.138 --> 02:28:38.336
right on the inside of the tunnel. What are you doing?

02:28:38.336 --> 02:28:40.927
MARISHA: What can I see quickly? Can I see any more

02:28:40.927 --> 02:28:42.640
of those glowing teal--?

02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:44.576
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:28:44.576 --> 02:28:46.662
MARISHA: With my quick glance around the room?

02:28:46.662 --> 02:28:48.840
Come on, don't fail me now.

02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:50.380
LIAM: With Truesight!

02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:51.715
MARISHA: 17.

02:28:51.715 --> 02:28:55.123
MATT: 17, looking about right now,

02:28:55.123 --> 02:28:57.062
all you can see from your perspective

02:28:57.062 --> 02:29:00.044
are the two charges immediately to your right and left,

02:29:00.044 --> 02:29:02.224
raised above the water surface

02:29:02.224 --> 02:29:06.528
and the deep blue glow coming from the central,

02:29:06.528 --> 02:29:08.679
flickering portal sliver,

02:29:08.679 --> 02:29:11.806
and the lights glowing from above in the far walls.

02:29:11.806 --> 02:29:13.723
That's all you can see.

02:29:14.795 --> 02:29:18.878
MARISHA: I just think towards Caleb's direction.

02:29:20.702 --> 02:29:24.268
He's ready to kill us. Stand down.

02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:26.742
TRAVIS: Can't he hear that?

02:29:26.742 --> 02:29:28.203
LAURA: Probably.
MARISHA: Probably.

02:29:28.203 --> 02:29:29.615
LIAM: I stand up at that,

02:29:29.615 --> 02:29:32.145
knowing that he probably can hear.

02:29:32.145 --> 02:29:33.228
MATT: Okay.

02:29:34.447 --> 02:29:35.780
Caleb stands up.

02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:39.049
LAURA: I look over. (water bubbling)

02:29:42.523 --> 02:29:44.123
MATT: Make a stealth check, Jester.

02:29:44.123 --> 02:29:46.206
(laughter)

02:29:50.084 --> 02:29:51.911
LAURA: That was pretty good.

02:29:51.911 --> 02:29:53.370
LIAM: Fuck.

02:29:53.370 --> 02:29:55.400
LAURA: 21. (laughs)

02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:57.042
MATT: Okay, I mean--

02:29:58.475 --> 02:30:00.058
MARISHA: Sorry we're late.

02:30:01.156 --> 02:30:05.610
MATT: "I'll say you're quite quick in some ways.

02:30:05.610 --> 02:30:06.777
"I'm impressed."

02:30:07.717 --> 02:30:09.186
MARISHA: How long have you been here setting up

02:30:09.186 --> 02:30:11.378
the party by yourself?

02:30:11.378 --> 02:30:15.112
MATT: Cree grumbles over the shoulder. (grunts)

02:30:15.112 --> 02:30:19.525
(as Lucien) "Not terribly long, maybe
about a better part of an hour."

02:30:19.525 --> 02:30:22.520
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we actually did make pretty good time.

02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:25.447
MATT: "But we had to set up some precautions,

02:30:25.447 --> 02:30:28.779
"since you tend to follow and nip at our heels,

02:30:28.779 --> 02:30:33.128
"and well, you taught us a few tricks along the way."

02:30:33.128 --> 02:30:34.831
LIAM: Isn't this the part where you kick back

02:30:34.831 --> 02:30:38.648
and tell us all your clever plans?

02:30:41.505 --> 02:30:42.338
MATT: "Sure.

02:30:44.033 --> 02:30:45.200
"Step in a bit."

02:30:47.370 --> 02:30:50.901
LIAM: I take a step in and look
around for more of the things.

02:30:50.901 --> 02:30:53.568
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

02:30:55.332 --> 02:30:56.218
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:30:56.218 --> 02:30:57.971
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: (laughs)

02:30:57.971 --> 02:30:59.343
MATT: From your perspective, at the entrance

02:30:59.343 --> 02:31:02.282
of the chamber, right now you can only see the two

02:31:02.282 --> 02:31:04.704
to your right and left.

02:31:04.704 --> 02:31:06.029
MARISHA: Is he bluffing?

02:31:07.778 --> 02:31:08.914
LIAM: Impossible to say.

02:31:08.914 --> 02:31:09.747
I think.

02:31:10.714 --> 02:31:13.292
MARISHA: I take another step in as well--

02:31:13.292 --> 02:31:14.391
MATT: Everyone else--
MARISHA: -- slowly.

02:31:14.391 --> 02:31:17.357
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast a quick
spell on myself before I come in

02:31:17.357 --> 02:31:18.638
and then I'm going to come in.

02:31:18.638 --> 02:31:19.471
MATT: What spell do you cast?

02:31:19.471 --> 02:31:20.304
TALIESIN: Death Ward.

02:31:20.304 --> 02:31:22.577
MATT: Okay, Death Ward is on you.

02:31:22.577 --> 02:31:24.926
LIAM: They do, they're above the water surface.

02:31:24.926 --> 02:31:26.876
TRAVIS: Right, so they can't be under.

02:31:26.876 --> 02:31:29.086
MATT: Yeah, they're above on the platform right now

02:31:29.086 --> 02:31:32.396
which is about-- the full climb of it is maybe

02:31:32.396 --> 02:31:34.273
four and a half, five feet up,

02:31:34.273 --> 02:31:35.865
so it's about a foot out of the water.

02:31:35.865 --> 02:31:37.290
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I meant the intuit charges.

02:31:37.290 --> 02:31:40.065
They float far enough off the ground to be above water.

02:31:40.065 --> 02:31:41.326
MATT: Oh yeah.

02:31:41.326 --> 02:31:45.709
LIAM: Do we see the threshold stones

02:31:45.709 --> 02:31:47.166
that they need for this to work?

02:31:47.166 --> 02:31:48.118
MATT: With your perception check,

02:31:48.118 --> 02:31:50.686
you see, on the platform,

02:31:50.686 --> 02:31:52.285
right by where the ring is,

02:31:52.285 --> 02:31:54.373
there are the two satchels,

02:31:54.373 --> 02:31:57.851
the same heavy ones that are right there.

02:31:57.851 --> 02:31:59.768
At this point, as you guys are taking a couple of steps in,

02:31:59.768 --> 02:32:03.497
Lucien puts a hand up for you to, like, halt.

02:32:03.497 --> 02:32:05.537
And the rest of you filter in a little bit,

02:32:05.537 --> 02:32:09.892
right within just the beginning of that alcove.

02:32:09.892 --> 02:32:11.108
MARISHA: I don't like this.

02:32:11.108 --> 02:32:13.424
MATT: "I've not been a poor host.

02:32:13.424 --> 02:32:16.607
"I lent you my personal reading. (laughs)

02:32:18.057 --> 02:32:21.644
"And taking what I was owed, I borrowed a few things

02:32:21.644 --> 02:32:25.352
"with intent to return them, though some of these

02:32:25.352 --> 02:32:26.316
"pretties intrigue me."

02:32:26.316 --> 02:32:27.865
As he runs his hands across each other

02:32:27.865 --> 02:32:30.094
and apparating from his hand you see a small,

02:32:30.094 --> 02:32:33.551
glowing yellow orb that he begins to spin

02:32:33.551 --> 02:32:35.218
through his fingers.

02:32:36.659 --> 02:32:37.585
Bowie-style.

02:32:37.585 --> 02:32:39.668
(laughter)

02:32:41.023 --> 02:32:42.534
And then it vanishes.

02:32:42.534 --> 02:32:46.867
The familiar Cloven Crystal, somewhere in his grasp.

02:32:47.854 --> 02:32:50.617
"We defended ourselves when assailed

02:32:50.617 --> 02:32:54.079
"and even then I invited you to come see

02:32:54.079 --> 02:32:56.329
"what we've been working on.

02:32:57.255 --> 02:32:59.612
"Letting bygones be what they are

02:32:59.612 --> 02:33:02.921
"and still, you treat us with such animosity.

02:33:04.311 --> 02:33:05.144
"Shame.

02:33:06.356 --> 02:33:08.500
"Manners are important and the last thing to go

02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:09.975
"when an age runs dry.

02:33:12.233 --> 02:33:15.001
"I do still very much want to show you what I've

02:33:15.001 --> 02:33:18.633
"been working on, but I feel like you've shown me

02:33:18.633 --> 02:33:20.574
"how hard it can be to trust.

02:33:22.042 --> 02:33:24.125
"So I need you to earn it."

02:33:25.484 --> 02:33:27.351
Cree at this point, she goes,

02:33:27.351 --> 02:33:29.758
"Why don't we just kill them, Lucien?

02:33:29.758 --> 02:33:31.175
"Stop the games."

02:33:32.146 --> 02:33:34.509
Lucien puts the hand up.

02:33:34.509 --> 02:33:35.342
"Shh."

02:33:37.032 --> 02:33:38.398
Still looking over in your direction.

02:33:38.398 --> 02:33:42.918
"Because try as I might, a part of me still likes them."

02:33:42.918 --> 02:33:46.668
MARISHA: I just in my head look at Lucien and I say,

02:33:47.598 --> 02:33:50.315
"You should listen to the woman."

02:33:50.315 --> 02:33:52.089
Not audibly.

02:33:52.089 --> 02:33:54.027
MATT: As he looks towards you with a smile,

02:33:54.027 --> 02:33:56.780
there's a part of him that twitches for a moment,

02:33:56.780 --> 02:33:58.722
and he kind of--

02:33:58.722 --> 02:33:59.897
(exhales)

02:33:59.897 --> 02:34:00.940
(cracks fingers)

02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:02.023
LAURA: Ooh, he didn't like it.

02:34:02.023 --> 02:34:03.090
MARISHA: Yeah, what was that?

02:34:03.090 --> 02:34:04.932
LAURA: Also, I should say, my Pass Without a Trace

02:34:04.932 --> 02:34:06.883
was still up because it lasts for an hour

02:34:06.883 --> 02:34:08.835
from the last time I cast it.

02:34:08.835 --> 02:34:11.555
So my stealth roll would have been 31.

02:34:11.555 --> 02:34:12.388
MATT: Okay.

02:34:12.388 --> 02:34:13.563
Good to know.
TRAVIS: You're still just (water bubbling).

02:34:13.563 --> 02:34:15.413
LAURA: I'm just under the water.

02:34:19.452 --> 02:34:21.963
I just don't want to come up.

02:34:21.963 --> 02:34:25.480
LIAM: Well, tell us more, circus man.

02:34:26.755 --> 02:34:28.722
MATT: The twitch kicks in again and he's like,

02:34:28.722 --> 02:34:32.265
he looks confused for a minute and for a brief moment

02:34:32.265 --> 02:34:36.340
there's like a hollow confusion.

02:34:37.265 --> 02:34:39.773
MARISHA: What is-- why, why?
LAURA: It's Molly?

02:34:39.773 --> 02:34:40.943
MARISHA: Insight check?

02:34:40.943 --> 02:34:42.021
Insight check!

02:34:42.021 --> 02:34:44.021
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:34:45.253 --> 02:34:46.788
TALIESIN: Can I get in on that?

02:34:46.788 --> 02:34:47.621
MATT: Sure.

02:34:47.621 --> 02:34:49.204
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:34:50.576 --> 02:34:51.409
24.

02:34:51.409 --> 02:34:52.242
TALIESIN: 30.

02:34:53.146 --> 02:34:54.106
MARISHA: Not as good as him.

02:34:54.106 --> 02:34:55.564
TALIESIN: Well, Bless.

02:34:55.564 --> 02:34:59.147
MATT: Something about the words rang something.

02:35:00.034 --> 02:35:01.872
MARISHA: Something about the words?

02:35:01.872 --> 02:35:03.943
MATT: That Caleb used, rang something in him

02:35:03.943 --> 02:35:06.484
that even he doesn't quite understand,

02:35:06.484 --> 02:35:08.255
with the 30, you get that.

02:35:08.255 --> 02:35:11.804
TALIESIN: It's not-- it's the
message, not the delivery system

02:35:11.804 --> 02:35:15.016
is what I-- if that makes sense?

02:35:15.016 --> 02:35:16.190
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:17.090
LAURA: Circus man?

02:35:17.090 --> 02:35:18.765
MATT: With a 30.

02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:21.358
LAURA: Yeah.

02:35:21.358 --> 02:35:22.791
MATT: "Long ago,

02:35:24.724 --> 02:35:27.949
"there was a group of people

02:35:29.264 --> 02:35:33.847
"who had an idea to get away from oppressive minds

02:35:34.693 --> 02:35:36.693
"and pursue their dreams.

02:35:38.381 --> 02:35:41.948
"And when destruction came, not of their making,

02:35:41.948 --> 02:35:44.948
"they were ready, or so they thought,

02:35:46.593 --> 02:35:50.814
"as they shunted their people across the planes

02:35:50.814 --> 02:35:54.054
"to safety, in the astral plane where they knew

02:35:54.054 --> 02:35:57.774
"they could make their dreams a reality.

02:35:57.774 --> 02:36:01.675
"Unfortunately, what they didn't
account for was this terrible

02:36:01.675 --> 02:36:04.284
"psychic storm that awaited them,

02:36:05.605 --> 02:36:10.017
"that racked every mind and spirit and shattered them

02:36:10.017 --> 02:36:14.759
"until they became one with their own city.

02:36:17.067 --> 02:36:20.067
"Death would have been a sweet mercy,

02:36:21.622 --> 02:36:23.479
"but instead, thousands of people

02:36:23.479 --> 02:36:27.396
"and the Somnovem that guided them, were broken.

02:36:29.269 --> 02:36:31.960
"And over time, slowly reformed,

02:36:34.210 --> 02:36:35.043
"powerful.

02:36:36.836 --> 02:36:38.941
"The instinct of their dreams driving them

02:36:38.941 --> 02:36:43.924
"in a place where they could will their dreams to be,

02:36:45.879 --> 02:36:48.712
"were their will not so fragmented.

02:36:51.737 --> 02:36:52.904
"They needed help.

02:36:54.334 --> 02:36:57.868
"But it was hard to push through the hunger.

02:36:57.868 --> 02:37:00.389
"For now, the city was alive

02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:04.405
"and things that live need to eat.

02:37:08.314 --> 02:37:11.429
"I was lucky to be a mind free,

02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:16.233
"one to speak to it and there's so much that they could do,

02:37:16.233 --> 02:37:19.695
"but they just lack the guidance.

02:37:19.695 --> 02:37:21.862
"It's a waste of potential.

02:37:26.492 --> 02:37:28.742
"But I think I can show them.

02:37:30.301 --> 02:37:31.684
"And

02:37:33.926 --> 02:37:37.149
"maybe if you decide to be more friend than foe,

02:37:37.149 --> 02:37:42.066
"when all is done, I could make
your dreams come true as well."

02:37:46.890 --> 02:37:50.909
Glances over towards Cree, and Cree gives him a nod.

02:37:50.909 --> 02:37:54.284
(as Lucien) "Well, like I said.

02:37:55.878 --> 02:37:57.748
"You've got to earn your path.

02:37:57.748 --> 02:38:01.331
"Show me that you really have what it takes,

02:38:02.235 --> 02:38:05.152
"beyond being a thorn in my drawers."

02:38:07.236 --> 02:38:10.971
Cree you see adjusting something on the contraption.

02:38:10.971 --> 02:38:15.693
MARISHA: I watch every click that she makes, just take note.

02:38:15.693 --> 02:38:20.043
MATT: She reaches over and you
can see she's holding this rod

02:38:20.043 --> 02:38:24.763
in one hand and there is a separate rod in the device.

02:38:24.763 --> 02:38:25.596
MARISHA: Okay.

02:38:26.661 --> 02:38:30.157
MATT: And she looks back and gives a nod to Lucien.

02:38:30.157 --> 02:38:32.560
Reaches over towards this lever

02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:36.437
to his side and just shifts it ever so slightly upward,

02:38:36.437 --> 02:38:37.520
like an inch.

02:38:38.684 --> 02:38:42.561
As it does, you watch the thin sliver in the ring

02:38:42.561 --> 02:38:45.707
widen just a bit, like a tear in space,

02:38:45.707 --> 02:38:49.339
as the slight trickle of a waterfall becomes

02:38:49.339 --> 02:38:50.672
a brief torrent.

02:38:51.691 --> 02:38:53.370
Water begins to pour into the chamber,

02:38:53.370 --> 02:38:56.311
foaming as Lucien and Cree step to the side.

02:38:56.311 --> 02:38:58.959
For a moment you feel the waves rush past,

02:38:58.959 --> 02:39:03.956
as it sploshes in and then he lowers it entirely,

02:39:03.956 --> 02:39:06.947
returning to that thin sliver once more.

02:39:09.197 --> 02:39:11.230
(as Lucien) "This door can go many places."

02:39:12.421 --> 02:39:15.510
As Cree switches out the rod with the other

02:39:15.510 --> 02:39:17.651
that was in her hand.

02:39:18.787 --> 02:39:22.416
MARISHA: Assuming you want us to go on a little field trip?

02:39:22.416 --> 02:39:25.333
MATT: "Well, I'm certainly going on one.

02:39:28.731 --> 02:39:30.306
"I guess it's a shame to work so hard,

02:39:30.306 --> 02:39:34.347
"and, I don't know, not to have anyone who really

02:39:34.347 --> 02:39:36.386
"understands it, who's right there to see it.

02:39:38.203 --> 02:39:42.657
"But I've seen potential in at least a couple of you.

02:39:42.657 --> 02:39:44.690
"You're already walking the right path."

02:39:44.690 --> 02:39:49.690
LIAM: And you plan to go and stay
there or bring something back

02:39:49.856 --> 02:39:53.366
and make this world better than how you found it?

02:39:53.366 --> 02:39:54.432
MATT: "Yes."

02:40:00.314 --> 02:40:02.266
TALIESIN: And you want us to be an audience?

02:40:02.266 --> 02:40:05.074
MATT: "Well, I'd love an audience,

02:40:05.074 --> 02:40:08.643
"but I'd like for you all to earn your ticket.

02:40:08.643 --> 02:40:10.905
"Come join the show."

02:40:10.905 --> 02:40:13.965
MARISHA: Maybe you should take your bodyguard.

02:40:13.965 --> 02:40:18.382
MATT: The water that poured out of the lip

02:40:18.382 --> 02:40:23.123
begins to undulate and begin to gather,

02:40:23.123 --> 02:40:27.676
like something that spilled through the sliver

02:40:27.676 --> 02:40:31.510
of a doorway, at which point, Lucien goes,

02:40:33.125 --> 02:40:34.829
"The other side perhaps."

02:40:34.829 --> 02:40:38.258
Takes a bow, and as he stands up from the bow,

02:40:38.258 --> 02:40:42.008
he pulls the lever up with him

02:40:42.008 --> 02:40:46.998
and that thin line tears open to an entire portal

02:40:46.998 --> 02:40:51.998
to fill the central ring and where once you saw glimpses

02:40:52.297 --> 02:40:55.793
of this endless watery, oceanic expanse,

02:40:55.793 --> 02:40:58.567
now you see a starscape,

02:40:58.567 --> 02:41:03.567
filled with waves of purple and gossamer, silk-like silver.

02:41:03.609 --> 02:41:04.530
And in the center of it--

02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:06.670
MARISHA: I kick Jester underneath the water really quick

02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:08.670
while this is happening.

02:41:09.843 --> 02:41:14.834
MATT: In the center of this space, you see a city,

02:41:16.554 --> 02:41:21.554
hundreds of beautiful towers, rising up with arches

02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:25.314
and bridges that connect, streets that line through,

02:41:25.314 --> 02:41:27.802
of all the tales you've heard of the Age of Arcanum,

02:41:27.802 --> 02:41:31.322
this meets or exceeds those expectations

02:41:31.322 --> 02:41:35.026
and it's familiar because you've seen the city before,

02:41:35.026 --> 02:41:35.943
in flashes.

02:41:37.734 --> 02:41:42.734
And as you focus, you watch as one of the towers twitches.

02:41:43.462 --> 02:41:47.352
Another, an eye opens up before shutting,

02:41:47.352 --> 02:41:49.102
across the stonework.

02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:52.663
"Well,

02:41:55.565 --> 02:41:58.138
"I think it's time you paid the ticket taker."

02:41:58.138 --> 02:42:01.555
And both of them turn, grab the satchels.

02:42:02.686 --> 02:42:05.248
MARISHA: Are we letting them go or are we running?

02:42:05.248 --> 02:42:08.416
MATT: And run through the portal.

02:42:08.416 --> 02:42:09.249
TRAVIS: What?

02:42:09.249 --> 02:42:10.848
LAURA: I don't know, are we trying to stop them?

02:42:10.848 --> 02:42:13.389
TRAVIS: No.
LIAM: No, we're following.

02:42:13.389 --> 02:42:17.666
MATT: You watch as they both leap and just begin to drift

02:42:17.666 --> 02:42:20.723
and then at once, Lucien puts his arms

02:42:20.723 --> 02:42:23.789
at his side and spins around, looking back at you,

02:42:23.789 --> 02:42:27.564
his now longer purple hair drifting,

02:42:29.289 --> 02:42:32.383
waves and then rockets off.
MARISHA: I dart towards the portal.

02:42:32.383 --> 02:42:33.624
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Hmm?

02:42:33.624 --> 02:42:34.553
MARISHA: I dart towards the portal.

02:42:34.553 --> 02:42:35.875
LIAM: Same, this isn't over.

02:42:35.875 --> 02:42:38.142
TRAVIS: I reach down and I grab
Jester in the water, pull her up.

02:42:38.142 --> 02:42:41.376
MATT: As you all gather up, the central whirl

02:42:41.376 --> 02:42:45.259
in the center of the chamber shoots up

02:42:45.259 --> 02:42:50.181
into this mass of twirling, angry, elemental liquid.

02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:54.451
You see tether like tentacles whipping around,

02:42:54.451 --> 02:42:58.460
some sort of terrifying, octopi-like elemental leviathan

02:42:58.460 --> 02:43:01.097
rises up from the ground, having escaped from the elemental

02:43:01.097 --> 02:43:04.022
plane where it was waiting for a chance.

02:43:05.127 --> 02:43:06.110
I need you all to roll initiative.

02:43:06.110 --> 02:43:08.052
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

02:43:08.052 --> 02:43:09.738
The ticket-taker is a bitch!

02:43:09.738 --> 02:43:11.196
SAM: Oh man!

02:43:11.196 --> 02:43:13.852
This combat is brought to you by Dwarven Forge,

02:43:13.852 --> 02:43:16.770
makers of premium, hand-crafted gaming terrain.

02:43:16.770 --> 02:43:18.878
If you want to become a master of battle maps

02:43:18.878 --> 02:43:20.909
like Matt Mercer,

02:43:20.909 --> 02:43:23.618
the best place to do it is Dwarven Forge

02:43:23.618 --> 02:43:24.715
starter sets.

02:43:24.715 --> 02:43:26.855
These starter sets are so easy to build,

02:43:26.855 --> 02:43:30.008
even Sam Regal-- spelled slightly wrong-- could do it.

02:43:30.008 --> 02:43:31.774
(laughter)

02:43:31.774 --> 02:43:32.607
Maybe.

02:43:33.691 --> 02:43:34.533
MATT: So.

02:43:34.533 --> 02:43:35.911
TALIESIN: I don't like this.

02:43:35.911 --> 02:43:38.257
MATT: I need first off, for you to tell me--

02:43:38.257 --> 02:43:40.569
Okay, the marching order would have been,

02:43:40.569 --> 02:43:42.792
Beauregard about there.

02:43:42.792 --> 02:43:43.625
Caleb.

02:43:43.625 --> 02:43:45.172
MARISHA: Something is coming through the portal?

02:43:45.172 --> 02:43:46.130
SAM: It's already here.

02:43:46.130 --> 02:43:46.963
MARISHA: It's already through?

02:43:46.963 --> 02:43:48.942
LIAM: It's the gush of water that came through.

02:43:48.942 --> 02:43:49.836
It was a being.
LAURA: He let it out.

02:43:49.836 --> 02:43:51.652
ASHLEY: The first rod-- he let out--

02:43:51.652 --> 02:43:53.327
LAURA: I would have been floating underneath

02:43:53.327 --> 02:43:55.172
one of the Intuit Charges.

02:43:55.172 --> 02:43:57.100
MATT: Okay, so you're right over there.

02:43:57.100 --> 02:43:59.745
SAM: I was, like, right behind them.

02:43:59.745 --> 02:44:03.610
LIAM: But they're gone. They can't set them off.

02:44:03.610 --> 02:44:04.990
TRAVIS: You can.

02:44:04.990 --> 02:44:06.310
LIAM: From another dimension?

02:44:06.310 --> 02:44:07.793
TALIESIN: Probably not.
LAURA: No, probably not.

02:44:07.793 --> 02:44:09.132
TRAVIS: I mean, the doorway is open, right?

02:44:09.132 --> 02:44:11.301
MATT: It should say on the item if it does.

02:44:11.301 --> 02:44:12.782
TALIESIN: Yeah, because otherwise we would have set it off

02:44:12.782 --> 02:44:13.913
from inside the mansion.

02:44:13.913 --> 02:44:16.904
LIAM: Looking.
SAM and LIAM: (robot voice) Looking.

02:44:16.904 --> 02:44:18.677
TRAVIS: But that doorway is open.

02:44:18.677 --> 02:44:19.524
ASHLEY: Yeah, we're going in, right?

02:44:19.524 --> 02:44:20.357
SAM: Yeah, it's open.

02:44:20.357 --> 02:44:21.590
TRAVIS: That's what I mean, though.

02:44:21.590 --> 02:44:24.398
LAURA: The gateway is open?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:44:24.398 --> 02:44:26.289
(cries of alarm)

02:44:26.289 --> 02:44:28.684
SAM: What the fuck is that?

02:44:28.684 --> 02:44:30.073
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby!

02:44:30.073 --> 02:44:32.272
LAURA: That is huge.

02:44:32.272 --> 02:44:34.873
LIAM: It doesn't say anything about dimension.

02:44:34.873 --> 02:44:35.706
SAM: It does.

02:44:35.706 --> 02:44:37.530
It says--
LIAM: Where does it say it?

02:44:37.530 --> 02:44:38.902
SAM: "You link your mind to the device.

02:44:38.902 --> 02:44:41.315
"At any time, you can choose to detonate the charge

02:44:41.315 --> 02:44:45.487
"as long as you are on the same plane of existence."

02:44:45.487 --> 02:44:46.320
LAURA: Great.

02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:47.580
SAM: Under "Remote."

02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:49.202
LIAM: It doesn't say that on mine.

02:44:49.202 --> 02:44:50.350
SAM: You got a different one.

02:44:50.350 --> 02:44:52.420
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: I have to update it.

02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:54.087
TALIESIN: So we would be good.

02:44:55.472 --> 02:44:58.721
LAURA: You could do your gateway door behind the leviathan

02:44:58.721 --> 02:44:59.554
and then we just run.

02:44:59.554 --> 02:45:01.637
(laughter)
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:45:03.762 --> 02:45:04.788
SAM: Well.

02:45:04.788 --> 02:45:06.212
TRAVIS: Yeah, my initiative sucks.

02:45:06.212 --> 02:45:07.928
MATT: 25 to 20.

02:45:07.928 --> 02:45:08.761
SAM: 20.
LAURA: 21.

02:45:10.023 --> 02:45:10.872
ASHLEY: 23.

02:45:10.872 --> 02:45:12.059
SAM: Ooh!

02:45:12.059 --> 02:45:13.780
Classic Ashley roll.

02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:16.635
TRAVIS: Yasha, Jester, Veth.
ASHLEY: 22, sorry.

02:45:16.635 --> 02:45:18.069
MATT: Still high. And then?

02:45:18.069 --> 02:45:18.902
MARISHA: Jester.
MATT: Veth.

02:45:18.902 --> 02:45:20.147
MARISHA: Veth.

02:45:20.147 --> 02:45:21.138
MATT: 20 to 15.

02:45:21.138 --> 02:45:22.688
MARISHA: 19.

02:45:22.688 --> 02:45:23.771
SAM: Water, huh?

02:45:25.317 --> 02:45:26.709
What can we do to water?

02:45:26.709 --> 02:45:27.931
MATT: Waist-high in the water.

02:45:27.931 --> 02:45:29.339
MARISHA: Sorry--
MATT: Except for Veth,

02:45:29.339 --> 02:45:30.730
your movement is halved

02:45:30.730 --> 02:45:32.939
because it's considered difficult terrain

02:45:32.939 --> 02:45:33.958
so just be aware of that.

02:45:33.958 --> 02:45:34.791
SAM: Okay.

02:45:34.791 --> 02:45:36.985
MARISHA: Also 20, sorry.

02:45:36.985 --> 02:45:37.818
MATT: Okay.

02:45:37.818 --> 02:45:39.381
MARISHA: So I'm at the same time as Veth.
LIAM: Probably good to remember that we can all

02:45:39.381 --> 02:45:40.497
breathe water.

02:45:40.497 --> 02:45:42.830
MATT: You both have 20 dex?

02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:44.235
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

02:45:44.235 --> 02:45:45.902
MATT: So you guys decide who goes first.

02:45:47.144 --> 02:45:49.560
SAM: You're slightly further forward.

02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:50.993
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: You can go first.

02:45:50.993 --> 02:45:52.324
MARISHA: All right.

02:45:52.324 --> 02:45:53.245
TRAVIS: Beau then Veth?

02:45:53.245 --> 02:45:55.917
MARISHA: Yeah, sorry, it was my bad.
ASHLEY: We're going in, yeah?

02:45:55.917 --> 02:45:58.734
LAURA: We're going in the portal, that's the goal.

02:45:59.627 --> 02:46:00.460
SAM: If we can get past--

02:46:00.460 --> 02:46:02.317
MATT: 15 to 10.
SAM: -- OctoMom.

02:46:02.317 --> 02:46:03.900
LIAM and TRAVIS: 10.

02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:07.559
TRAVIS: Your dex is probably higher than mine.

02:46:07.559 --> 02:46:09.154
LIAM: My dex is 12.

02:46:09.154 --> 02:46:10.237
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Wow.

02:46:11.228 --> 02:46:12.228
I'm so fast.

02:46:13.695 --> 02:46:14.661
MATT: Caduceus?

02:46:14.661 --> 02:46:16.151
TALIESIN: Nine.
MATT: Okay.

02:46:16.151 --> 02:46:17.702
MARISHA: Caleb.

02:46:17.702 --> 02:46:19.889
MATT: Yasha, you are up first as this creature

02:46:19.889 --> 02:46:23.330
now essentially fills the majority of the chamber forward

02:46:23.330 --> 02:46:26.967
towards this portal. What would you like to do?

02:46:26.967 --> 02:46:27.800
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:46:29.501 --> 02:46:33.888
I have an idea. For starters, I would like to rage.

02:46:33.888 --> 02:46:35.846
MATT: There you go.

02:46:35.846 --> 02:46:36.679
SAM: Correct.

02:46:36.679 --> 02:46:38.262
ASHLEY: And then--

02:46:40.229 --> 02:46:43.354
I haven't had a long rest, okay, never mind.

02:46:46.257 --> 02:46:49.146
I want to try to book it to the portal.

02:46:49.146 --> 02:46:51.037
TRAVIS: ♪ I want to try to book it to the portal. ♪

02:46:51.037 --> 02:46:52.877
ASHLEY: ♪ I want to try to book it to the portal. ♪

02:46:52.877 --> 02:46:56.069
So where am I at in there?

02:46:58.029 --> 02:47:01.299
SAM: You're the one that's covered in mist.

02:47:01.299 --> 02:47:02.683
I think you're towards the back, actually.

02:47:02.683 --> 02:47:05.005
TALIESIN: You're towards the back.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was by--

02:47:05.005 --> 02:47:08.063
LAURA: Yeah, you're like the farthest one back.

02:47:08.063 --> 02:47:10.365
No, second.

02:47:10.365 --> 02:47:13.032
ASHLEY: I think I was beside Caduceus.

02:47:14.970 --> 02:47:16.636
MATT: Correct.
SAM: Yeah, that's about right.

02:47:16.636 --> 02:47:17.522
You're second to last.

02:47:17.522 --> 02:47:20.842
ASHLEY: That's me, okay, okay, okay. So--

02:47:20.842 --> 02:47:24.370
MATT: Fjord and Essek towards the back.
ASHLEY: Let me just try to make it to the portal.

02:47:24.370 --> 02:47:25.690
MATT: Okay.

02:47:25.690 --> 02:47:28.273
ASHLEY: I want to just start running.

02:47:29.270 --> 02:47:32.695
MATT: 35, 40, 45, 50.

02:47:34.845 --> 02:47:36.167
What's your movement?

02:47:36.167 --> 02:47:37.026
ASHLEY: Yeah, 50.

02:47:37.026 --> 02:47:39.426
MATT: 50, you can get there on your movement and your bonus.

02:47:39.426 --> 02:47:42.767
You still have an action. However.

02:47:42.767 --> 02:47:45.583
SAM: Didn't you just say all of our movement is halved?

02:47:45.583 --> 02:47:48.374
MATT: Correct, so you would have actually been--

02:47:48.374 --> 02:47:49.781
MARISHA: Wait, why-- our movement's halved?

02:47:49.781 --> 02:47:50.614
LIAM: Because of the water.

02:47:50.614 --> 02:47:52.125
MATT: Because you're waist-high in water.

02:47:52.125 --> 02:47:53.961
ASHLEY: We're in waist-high water, goddamn it.

02:47:53.961 --> 02:47:56.603
MATT: So yeah, so that's your movement there.

02:47:56.603 --> 02:47:59.020
ASHLEY: What a smart spot to be in.

02:48:01.877 --> 02:48:03.776
I'm going to take a swing.

02:48:03.776 --> 02:48:04.776
MATT: Go for it.

02:48:06.359 --> 02:48:07.192
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:48:08.555 --> 02:48:10.138
Get my paper ready.

02:48:12.785 --> 02:48:14.703
SAM: Be like water.

02:48:14.703 --> 02:48:15.896
ASHLEY: 14.

02:48:15.896 --> 02:48:18.325
MATT: 14, misses, I'm sorry.

02:48:18.325 --> 02:48:20.713
ASHLEY: Cool. Okay, second hit.

02:48:20.713 --> 02:48:22.421
MATT: Go for it.

02:48:22.421 --> 02:48:23.254
ASHLEY: Nope.

02:48:23.254 --> 02:48:24.087
SAM: What?

02:48:24.087 --> 02:48:25.754
TRAVIS: Can you roll a 14?

02:48:26.705 --> 02:48:27.587
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I--

02:48:27.587 --> 02:48:28.420
TRAVIS: So it hit?

02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:32.947
ASHLEY: Yeah, because I rolled a five and it's a plus nine,

02:48:32.947 --> 02:48:35.435
and then I just rolled a four.

02:48:35.435 --> 02:48:36.411
LAURA: Wow.

02:48:36.411 --> 02:48:38.075
TALIESIN: You were talking about those dices earlier,

02:48:38.075 --> 02:48:38.908
I'm just saying.

02:48:38.908 --> 02:48:39.741
LAURA: Yeah, me too.

02:48:39.741 --> 02:48:43.644
ASHLEY: This one was usually good.

02:48:43.644 --> 02:48:45.440
MATT: Strength is 18, right?

02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:47.927
ASHLEY: Wait, I was swinging with my--

02:48:47.927 --> 02:48:48.760
MATT: Holy Avenger?

02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:49.878
ASHLEY: My Holy Avenger, yeah.

02:48:49.878 --> 02:48:52.120
MATT: Right, so it's proficiency bonus which is five.

02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:52.953
ASHLEY: Jesus.

02:48:52.953 --> 02:48:54.548
MATT: Plus strength which is four,

02:48:54.548 --> 02:48:56.389
plus weapon which is three.

02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:57.222
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:48:57.222 --> 02:48:58.540
MATT: So plus 12 to whatever you rolled.

02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:01.262
ASHLEY: Oh, then I was looking at-- (mumbling).

02:49:01.262 --> 02:49:02.845
MATT: That's okay.

02:49:02.845 --> 02:49:03.789
TRAVIS: That index card.

02:49:03.789 --> 02:49:04.958
ASHLEY: Christ, 17.

02:49:04.958 --> 02:49:06.571
TRAVIS: I'm going to make you the barbarian index card.

02:49:06.571 --> 02:49:07.741
MATT: 17?

02:49:07.741 --> 02:49:08.791
TRAVIS: That's all you need.
ASHLEY: 17.

02:49:08.791 --> 02:49:10.289
MATT: Just hits.

02:49:10.289 --> 02:49:12.586
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay.

02:49:12.586 --> 02:49:13.644
MARISHA: 17?
ASHLEY: Jeez louise.

02:49:13.644 --> 02:49:15.169
Okay, so first hit.

02:49:17.217 --> 02:49:18.050
SAM: Those dice.

02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:18.973
ASHLEY: I know, they're so small.

02:49:18.973 --> 02:49:20.764
LAURA: Does it have giant boobies?

02:49:20.764 --> 02:49:21.597
SAM: It does have.

02:49:21.597 --> 02:49:23.180
LIAM: It does.
MATT: It does, yeah.

02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:24.746
MARISHA: Oh, it does!

02:49:25.888 --> 02:49:26.759
ASHLEY: I'm going to do a Savage Attacker.

02:49:26.759 --> 02:49:27.919
LAURA: Water boobies!

02:49:27.919 --> 02:49:29.119
MARISHA: Water boobies!

02:49:29.119 --> 02:49:30.137
LAURA: That's some water boobies!

02:49:30.137 --> 02:49:33.591
SAM: I can't attack her. She looks too much like me.

02:49:33.591 --> 02:49:35.890
(laughter)

02:49:35.890 --> 02:49:37.923
ASHLEY: That would be

02:49:37.923 --> 02:49:39.828
33 points of damage.

02:49:39.828 --> 02:49:40.839
SAM: She's beautiful.

02:49:40.839 --> 02:49:43.537
MATT: 33 points of damage, nice.

02:49:43.537 --> 02:49:45.724
ASHLEY: And I already rolled a second hit, which was a four,

02:49:45.724 --> 02:49:48.138
so that would bring me to 16, so.

02:49:48.807 --> 02:49:51.084
MATT: Okay, 16 just misses.

02:49:51.084 --> 02:49:53.594
All right, so first swing as you rush up,

02:49:53.594 --> 02:49:55.724
trudging to the water, blade at the ready.

02:49:55.724 --> 02:49:56.954
Cut through and you can see,

02:49:56.954 --> 02:49:58.354
it hits water and you're expecting it

02:49:58.354 --> 02:49:59.518
to just cut through water.

02:49:59.518 --> 02:50:02.824
And it does, but the form does react to the impact.

02:50:02.824 --> 02:50:04.164
It does take damage.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:50:04.164 --> 02:50:05.124
MATT: The second swing, you go wide

02:50:05.124 --> 02:50:07.124
and one of the tentacles, hits the blade

02:50:07.124 --> 02:50:08.124
and deflects it off

02:50:08.124 --> 02:50:09.604
and it just (splashes) into the water next to you

02:50:09.604 --> 02:50:11.224
before you ready it.

02:50:11.224 --> 02:50:12.964
That's the end of your turn?

02:50:12.964 --> 02:50:14.214
ASHLEY: That's the end of my turn.

02:50:14.214 --> 02:50:15.047
MATT: Jester, you're up.

02:50:15.047 --> 02:50:16.291
Beau, you're on deck.

02:50:17.694 --> 02:50:21.994
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to

02:50:21.994 --> 02:50:24.910
also run forward to try to get past it.

02:50:25.924 --> 02:50:27.642
MATT: Okay, you get up, which is half your movement.

02:50:27.642 --> 02:50:29.334
LAURA: Uh-huh.

02:50:29.334 --> 02:50:31.854
MATT: And you can get that far on your movement.

02:50:31.854 --> 02:50:34.514
LAURA: Well, I wasn't prone, I was crouched.

02:50:34.514 --> 02:50:35.347
How high was the water?

02:50:35.347 --> 02:50:37.934
It was waist-level, so I was like--

02:50:37.934 --> 02:50:38.904
Okay, but whatever.

02:50:38.904 --> 02:50:40.369
It's not like I was laying down.

02:50:40.369 --> 02:50:41.377
MATT: I'll allow it.

02:50:41.377 --> 02:50:42.627
Fine, fine, all right.

02:50:43.769 --> 02:50:47.224
TRAVIS: You did say you were on your back.

02:50:47.224 --> 02:50:48.444
LIAM: We're just booking it, right?

02:50:48.444 --> 02:50:49.454
We're all just running through this?

02:50:49.454 --> 02:50:50.824
MARISHA: Yeah, we're trying to get to the portal.

02:50:50.824 --> 02:50:52.490
Trying to get to the portal.
SAM: You were standing fully upright.

02:50:52.490 --> 02:50:54.287
LIAM: We're not trying to kill--
SAM: Just also underwater.

02:50:54.287 --> 02:50:56.135
MATT: (laughs)
LAURA: No, I was crouched!

02:50:56.135 --> 02:50:58.813
You know, you can be under--

02:50:58.813 --> 02:51:00.193
And look, I'm crouching.

02:51:00.193 --> 02:51:01.084
TRAVIS: Are you doing this right now?

02:51:01.084 --> 02:51:03.464
LAURA: Yeah, I'm showing you
how I can crouch and be underwater.

02:51:03.464 --> 02:51:04.785
SAM: Sure, sure.

02:51:04.785 --> 02:51:05.924
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:51:05.924 --> 02:51:07.724
LIAM: Are you pooping?
LAURA: I was pooping.

02:51:08.584 --> 02:51:11.514
Anyway, if you want to take half my movement, that's fine.

02:51:11.514 --> 02:51:12.834
MATT: No, that's fine.

02:51:12.834 --> 02:51:13.944
What are you going to do?

02:51:13.944 --> 02:51:16.094
LAURA: I'm going to try to cast a spell on it.

02:51:16.094 --> 02:51:18.074
MATT: It is still half your movement to get there, though.

02:51:18.074 --> 02:51:20.019
LAURA: Yeah, I'm right next to Yasha.

02:51:20.019 --> 02:51:21.585
SAM: Also, Sprinkle died again.

02:51:21.585 --> 02:51:23.234
LAURA: Sprinkle's fine.

02:51:23.234 --> 02:51:26.727
MATT: Sprinkle technically is partially archfey.
LAURA: Sprarty is fine.

02:51:27.867 --> 02:51:29.378
I'm going to say: Do something!

02:51:29.378 --> 02:51:30.711
And I'm going to cast...

02:51:31.869 --> 02:51:33.914
Polymorph.

02:51:33.914 --> 02:51:34.944
MATT: Polymorph?
SAM: Sure.

02:51:34.944 --> 02:51:36.244
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Sure.

02:51:36.244 --> 02:51:37.494
MATT: What's the save on it?

02:51:37.494 --> 02:51:38.704
LAURA: 18 wisdom.

02:51:38.704 --> 02:51:40.824
MATT: 18 wisdom.

02:51:40.824 --> 02:51:42.484
It rolled a 20.

02:51:42.484 --> 02:51:43.484
LAURA: Okay.

02:51:43.484 --> 02:51:44.594
SAM: It's wise.

02:51:44.594 --> 02:51:48.394
LAURA: I figured it would be,
but it was worth a shot, right?

02:51:48.394 --> 02:51:49.824
ASHLEY: Worth a shot, good.
MATT: But good try.

02:51:49.824 --> 02:51:51.615
All right, that finishes your go.

02:51:51.615 --> 02:51:52.906
LAURA: Yeah, I'm gonna--

02:51:52.906 --> 02:51:55.914
Can I use my bonus action?

02:51:55.914 --> 02:51:58.084
I'm going to move my duplicate.

02:51:58.084 --> 02:51:58.917
MATT: Okay.

02:52:00.264 --> 02:52:01.794
LAURA: Around to the other side of it,

02:52:01.794 --> 02:52:04.064
to where it looks like she's trying to flank.

02:52:04.064 --> 02:52:05.665
MATT: Okay, easy enough to do.

02:52:05.665 --> 02:52:07.564
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, ooh, lies!

02:52:07.564 --> 02:52:09.764
I'm going to move my duplicate to be

02:52:10.664 --> 02:52:13.022
on the other side of Yasha, so she's within five feet of me.

02:52:13.022 --> 02:52:14.104
I'm going to move her--

02:52:14.964 --> 02:52:16.094
MATT: Oh, so over--

02:52:16.094 --> 02:52:18.554
LAURA: Yeah, I want her to be next to me.

02:52:18.554 --> 02:52:19.387
MATT: Over here, you mean?

02:52:19.387 --> 02:52:20.834
LAURA: Yeah, because she'll give me--

02:52:20.834 --> 02:52:21.894
it'll be harder to hit me.

02:52:21.894 --> 02:52:23.064
MATT: Okay, you got it.

02:52:23.064 --> 02:52:24.834
All right, that finishes Jester's go.

02:52:24.834 --> 02:52:26.394
Beau, you're up, with Veth on deck.

02:52:26.394 --> 02:52:27.654
MARISHA: I will head to the direction

02:52:27.654 --> 02:52:30.514
that Jester's duplicate <i>was</i> heading in,

02:52:30.514 --> 02:52:34.124
on that flank side, on to the right of the creature.

02:52:34.124 --> 02:52:38.604
I have unarmored move, which means I can dart on water.

02:52:38.604 --> 02:52:39.594
MATT: You can.

02:52:39.594 --> 02:52:41.600
MARISHA: So, I can still get my full move, yeah?

02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:43.664
MATT: You can, so you can literally jump out of the water

02:52:43.664 --> 02:52:46.404
and just Naruto run across the surface.

02:52:46.404 --> 02:52:51.234
MARISHA: Which is what I do and I get to its hind side.

02:52:51.234 --> 02:52:52.067
MATT: Okay.

02:52:53.114 --> 02:52:53.947
Right there?

02:52:53.947 --> 02:52:54.844
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:52:54.844 --> 02:52:55.677
MATT: Easy enough to do.

02:52:55.677 --> 02:52:59.572
SAM: The Hind Side, starring Sandra Bullock.

02:52:59.572 --> 02:53:00.932
MATT: (laughs)

02:53:00.932 --> 02:53:02.864
LAURA: Oh, Matt, I read the thing wrong.

02:53:02.864 --> 02:53:04.154
I do want it on the other side.

02:53:04.154 --> 02:53:06.324
If we're both within five feet of the creature,

02:53:06.324 --> 02:53:07.274
I get advantage.

02:53:07.274 --> 02:53:08.304
MATT: Oh, I see.
LAURA: That's all.

02:53:08.304 --> 02:53:10.363
MATT: Okay, so there you go, the other corner.

02:53:14.356 --> 02:53:15.364
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to hit it.

02:53:15.364 --> 02:53:17.194
I'm gonna take out my stick.

02:53:17.194 --> 02:53:19.544
I'm gonna hit the abyssal monster.

02:53:19.544 --> 02:53:21.614
SAM: Wet pop, wet pop.

02:53:21.614 --> 02:53:22.788
MARISHA: Slap, slap.

02:53:22.788 --> 02:53:23.744
(laughter)

02:53:23.744 --> 02:53:24.736
LIAM: Slip slop.

02:53:24.736 --> 02:53:28.004
MATT: That's pretty accurate.
MARISHA: The first one is a 21.

02:53:28.004 --> 02:53:29.034
MATT: That hits.
TRAVIS: Splash, splash.

02:53:29.034 --> 02:53:31.031
MARISHA: Second one is a 15, which I believe misses.

02:53:31.031 --> 02:53:33.914
MATT: It misses.
MARISHA: Rolled really low, but--

02:53:33.914 --> 02:53:35.136
LAURA: That one got caught in the water.

02:53:35.136 --> 02:53:37.314
MARISHA: It did, it got a little drag

02:53:37.314 --> 02:53:39.858
as I tried to swing my staff around.

02:53:39.858 --> 02:53:41.506
LIAM: A little bit of a shiver and queef.

02:53:41.506 --> 02:53:43.127
(laughter)

02:53:43.127 --> 02:53:44.637
MARISHA: And that's 12 damage.

02:53:44.637 --> 02:53:48.227
MATT: 12 damage, you got it.

02:53:48.227 --> 02:53:49.160
MARISHA: Stunning Strike?

02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:52.484
MATT: Stunning Strike, okay.
MARISHA: Can I stun this thing?

02:53:52.484 --> 02:53:54.584
Did it invent stun?

02:53:54.584 --> 02:53:56.164
MATT: It has no effect on it.

02:53:56.164 --> 02:53:58.024
MARISHA: Of course it doesn't.

02:53:58.024 --> 02:53:58.857
MATT: Meaning, you attempt to stun

02:53:58.857 --> 02:54:01.347
and it does not seem to be stunned.

02:54:01.347 --> 02:54:02.472
TALIESIN: Extract--

02:54:02.472 --> 02:54:04.611
MARISHA: That is what I will do next,

02:54:04.611 --> 02:54:07.484
which I will do with my Flurry of Blows.

02:54:07.484 --> 02:54:09.126
MATT: Do it, two more.

02:54:09.126 --> 02:54:10.609
Slap, slap.
MARISHA: Two more.

02:54:10.609 --> 02:54:12.748
MATT: Slap, slap.
MARISHA: (mumbles)

02:54:12.748 --> 02:54:14.934
Shlap, shlap.
LIAM: Slap-a da bass.

02:54:14.934 --> 02:54:16.909
MARISHA: Those both hit.
MATT: All right.

02:54:17.767 --> 02:54:19.934
TRAVIS: Slap-a da bass.

02:54:19.934 --> 02:54:21.134
TALIESIN: Goddamn.

02:54:21.134 --> 02:54:22.633
MARISHA: And that is...

02:54:24.442 --> 02:54:27.325
13 damage and nine damage.

02:54:27.325 --> 02:54:28.416
MATT: 13 and nine.

02:54:28.416 --> 02:54:31.134
LAURA: This thing is going down.
MARISHA: So 22 total.

02:54:31.134 --> 02:54:32.791
Extract Aspects.

02:54:32.791 --> 02:54:35.124
MATT: All right, it is resistant to bludgeoning,

02:54:35.124 --> 02:54:37.354
piercing and slashing from non-magical attacks.

02:54:37.354 --> 02:54:40.914
MARISHA: Pierce, slicing, okay.

02:54:40.914 --> 02:54:43.474
MATT: It is immune to acid and poison.

02:54:43.474 --> 02:54:45.817
MARISHA: Immune to acid.

02:54:45.817 --> 02:54:47.556
SAM: Shoot some electricity at it.

02:54:47.556 --> 02:54:49.114
MARISHA: And poison, okay.

02:54:49.114 --> 02:54:51.184
ASHLEY: What was the first bit?

02:54:51.184 --> 02:54:52.554
MARISHA: Bludgeoning, piercing, slicing.

02:54:52.554 --> 02:54:54.678
ASHLEY: That's no good.

02:54:54.678 --> 02:54:55.511
MATT: For <i>non-magical</i> attacks.

02:54:55.511 --> 02:54:56.904
MARISHA: For non-magic-- we're all gold.

02:54:56.904 --> 02:54:58.834
MATT: Magic weapons will get through.

02:54:58.834 --> 02:55:03.474
It is also immune to exhaustion, grappled,

02:55:03.474 --> 02:55:08.426
paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone.

02:55:09.474 --> 02:55:12.674
MARISHA: All the Ps?
MATT: Restrained and stunned.

02:55:12.674 --> 02:55:16.524
LIAM: You read all its chi.
MARISHA: Restrained, stunned.

02:55:16.524 --> 02:55:18.230
Okay, cool, cool, cool.
TALIESIN: It can't be stopped.

02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:19.314
There's no stopping--

02:55:19.314 --> 02:55:22.124
MATT: This is an unstoppable water elemental.

02:55:22.124 --> 02:55:23.144
SAM: Did you say charm in there?

02:55:23.144 --> 02:55:24.424
MARISHA: Did not say charm.

02:55:24.424 --> 02:55:25.624
MATT: Charm is not in there.

02:55:27.529 --> 02:55:32.464
MARISHA: Acid, poison, exhaustion, grappling, paralyzed,

02:55:32.464 --> 02:55:35.647
petrification, poison, prone.

02:55:36.534 --> 02:55:37.784
TRAVIS: Personification.

02:55:37.784 --> 02:55:40.554
MARISHA: Rest, what is rest?

02:55:40.554 --> 02:55:41.874
SAM: Paprika.
MATT: Restrained.

02:55:41.874 --> 02:55:43.333
MARISHA: Restrained!

02:55:43.333 --> 02:55:46.230
MATT: It's immune to rest, guys.
MARISHA: And stun.

02:55:46.230 --> 02:55:47.304
MATT: It's a work horse.

02:55:47.304 --> 02:55:48.881
LAURA: I never sleep.

02:55:48.881 --> 02:55:50.824
LIAM: Oh, so it's us.

02:55:50.824 --> 02:55:53.594
LAURA: So, when you Extract Aspects,

02:55:53.594 --> 02:55:55.994
can you tell if it's, like, a sentient being?

02:55:55.994 --> 02:55:58.404
Or if it's a mindless attacking monster?

02:55:58.404 --> 02:56:02.054
MARISHA: I can only figure out what it's immune

02:56:02.054 --> 02:56:06.427
and resistant and vulnerable to,

02:56:07.984 --> 02:56:10.844
but since it's immune to stun and all these things,

02:56:10.844 --> 02:56:12.024
I feel like it's sentient.

02:56:12.024 --> 02:56:14.817
That feels, yeah.

02:56:16.644 --> 02:56:18.094
I don't know. It feels smart.

02:56:19.124 --> 02:56:20.744
Which I'd say. I tell people:

02:56:20.744 --> 02:56:24.764
It feels smart and tough, but it doesn't--

02:56:24.764 --> 02:56:28.984
not getting any pings on elemental damage, is what I say.

02:56:28.984 --> 02:56:29.974
MATT: There you go.

02:56:29.974 --> 02:56:32.264
Finishing Beau's go. Veth, you're up.

02:56:32.264 --> 02:56:33.747
SAM: I will dart left.

02:56:35.884 --> 02:56:37.506
Skimming across the water.

02:56:37.506 --> 02:56:39.373
TRAVIS: ♪ Skimming across. ♪

02:56:39.373 --> 02:56:41.534
MATT: Whereabouts?
SAM and MARISHA: ♪ Skimming my way. ♪

02:56:41.534 --> 02:56:42.534
SAM: As far as I can get.

02:56:42.534 --> 02:56:44.484
I can only move 30 feet.

02:56:44.484 --> 02:56:47.214
MATT: Yeah, you can get there's
about where you're going to sit.

02:56:47.214 --> 02:56:51.789
SAM: And then I will throw buttons at it and say:

02:56:51.789 --> 02:56:53.242
Buttons!

02:56:53.242 --> 02:56:55.784
(laughter)

02:56:55.784 --> 02:56:58.304
And I will cast Hypnotic Pattern

02:56:58.304 --> 02:57:02.179
in a sort of a desperate move

02:57:02.179 --> 02:57:03.824
to stun it or something.

02:57:03.824 --> 02:57:04.932
MATT: Okay, got it.

02:57:04.932 --> 02:57:07.744
LAURA: Does that affect me and Yasha as well?

02:57:07.744 --> 02:57:09.784
SAM: Well, maybe?
LAURA: And Beau?

02:57:09.784 --> 02:57:10.617
MATT: Where do you create?

02:57:10.617 --> 02:57:12.404
It's a 30-foot cube.
SAM: It's a 30-foot cube.

02:57:12.404 --> 02:57:14.254
I was hoping--

02:57:14.254 --> 02:57:17.084
LIAM: Aim high.
SAM: -- that I could center it

02:57:17.084 --> 02:57:21.044
in a way that is, like, if it's you, Matt,

02:57:21.044 --> 02:57:26.044
it would be your left side that way,

02:57:26.224 --> 02:57:28.844
but in a way that it wouldn't hit Jester and Yasha.

02:57:28.844 --> 02:57:31.084
MATT: The ceiling is about 30-feet tall.

02:57:31.084 --> 02:57:33.234
So if you were to point the center of it--

02:57:35.224 --> 02:57:37.464
SAM: Could I focus a cube to its back left,

02:57:37.464 --> 02:57:39.534
that it would hit only it?

02:57:39.534 --> 02:57:41.014
MATT: Over here? You could, yeah.

02:57:41.014 --> 02:57:42.322
SAM: Yes. That.
MATT: Okay.

02:57:42.322 --> 02:57:46.194
So you guys watch as this corner now becomes filled

02:57:46.194 --> 02:57:49.204
with this space of coloration.

02:57:49.204 --> 02:57:51.814
Weird semi-transparent patterns begin

02:57:51.814 --> 02:57:53.558
to just shiver.

02:57:53.558 --> 02:57:54.977
LAURA: And quiff.
MATT: And quiff.

02:57:54.977 --> 02:57:57.834
(laughter)

02:57:57.834 --> 02:58:02.024
MATT: Shiver and can move between them and tie and untie.

02:58:02.024 --> 02:58:03.374
It's pretty trippy.

02:58:03.374 --> 02:58:05.264
ASHLEY: Shiver and quiff.

02:58:05.264 --> 02:58:07.454
SAM: Shiver me quiffs.

02:58:07.454 --> 02:58:08.604
MATT: Thankfully, it's the only one within the--

02:58:08.604 --> 02:58:11.206
(laughter)
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

02:58:11.206 --> 02:58:13.794
MATT: It rolls a fail.

02:58:13.794 --> 02:58:15.474
So it's going to use a Legendary Resistance to succeed.

02:58:15.474 --> 02:58:18.006
SAM: Oh, it's a legendary creature.

02:58:18.006 --> 02:58:20.305
Everybody, I've extracted another aspect.

02:58:20.305 --> 02:58:22.682
(laughter)

02:58:22.682 --> 02:58:24.911
It's a legendary creature!

02:58:24.911 --> 02:58:26.744
MATT: All right. Is that your turn, Veth?

02:58:27.742 --> 02:58:29.794
SAM: Yeah, I have a bonus action.

02:58:29.794 --> 02:58:30.914
MATT: You do.

02:58:30.914 --> 02:58:33.564
SAM: I guess I can bonus action...

02:58:35.756 --> 02:58:37.624
dash? Keep dashing?

02:58:37.624 --> 02:58:38.865
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:58:40.194 --> 02:58:41.774
SAM: Towards that table with the levers

02:58:41.774 --> 02:58:43.184
and stuff on it, yeah.
MATT: Over here?

02:58:43.184 --> 02:58:44.207
SAM: Yeah, somewhere back there.

02:58:44.207 --> 02:58:46.354
MATT: Okay. Now, you can definitely get up onto there

02:58:46.354 --> 02:58:47.814
and get next to the table.

02:58:47.814 --> 02:58:51.264
The portal's flickering next to you and as you glance over,

02:58:51.264 --> 02:58:53.254
you look into the space and you can see

02:58:53.254 --> 02:58:55.434
the awe dreamy expanse of the Astral Sea.

02:58:55.434 --> 02:58:57.594
And there beyond it, Cognouza,

02:58:57.594 --> 02:58:59.914
the living city staring back at you.

02:58:59.914 --> 02:59:01.924
Literally staring back at you in some ways.

02:59:01.924 --> 02:59:03.844
SAM: Oh jesus, that's creepy.

02:59:03.844 --> 02:59:05.276
LAURA: Yeah, we should try to keep going.

02:59:05.276 --> 02:59:06.118
LIAM: Just go.

02:59:06.118 --> 02:59:08.526
SAM: The most livable city in the Abyss.

02:59:08.526 --> 02:59:10.974
Voted every-- three years running.

02:59:10.974 --> 02:59:12.254
MATT: All right, that finishes Veth's go.

02:59:12.254 --> 02:59:14.344
TRAVIS: So many Michelin stars.

02:59:14.344 --> 02:59:15.764
MATT: It is now the creature's turn.

02:59:15.764 --> 02:59:17.454
LAURA and LIAM: No.
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:59:17.454 --> 02:59:18.319
LIAM: Are you sure?
MARISHA: This is going to be bad.

02:59:18.319 --> 02:59:19.656
MATT: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
LAURA: It's gonna be bad.

02:59:19.656 --> 02:59:20.924
SAM: No, no, no, it's fine.

02:59:20.924 --> 02:59:21.944
It's got one attack.
LAURA: All of us

02:59:21.944 --> 02:59:25.234
are going to get sucked into a whirlpool vortex.

02:59:25.234 --> 02:59:29.744
SAM: It can just do a punch attack for six points of damage.

02:59:29.744 --> 02:59:31.174
That's it.
MATT: It's going to,

02:59:31.174 --> 02:59:33.084
as Beauregard sits right there on the edge.

02:59:33.084 --> 02:59:34.054
LAURA: Did it get--

02:59:34.054 --> 02:59:34.924
Oh.
MATT: It's going to go ahead

02:59:34.924 --> 02:59:37.504
and maneuver itself right here.

02:59:37.504 --> 02:59:38.337
LIAM: Nice. Nice.

02:59:38.337 --> 02:59:40.064
MARISHA: Do I get a Sentinel attack

02:59:40.064 --> 02:59:41.714
or is it still in my range?

02:59:41.714 --> 02:59:43.644
MATT: It does move out of your range, technically,

02:59:43.644 --> 02:59:44.802
as it tries to-- (whoosh)

02:59:46.604 --> 02:59:48.394
MARISHA: But it's immune to--

02:59:48.394 --> 02:59:49.227
SAM: Everything.

02:59:50.314 --> 02:59:52.034
MARISHA: But Sentinel doesn't technically--

02:59:52.034 --> 02:59:52.867
MATT: It doesn't grapple anything.

02:59:52.867 --> 02:59:54.254
It just reduces speed to zero.

02:59:54.254 --> 02:59:55.117
MARISHA: To zero.

02:59:56.394 --> 02:59:57.424
Who knows? Maybe this will--

02:59:57.424 --> 02:59:58.654
Oh, oh, yeah.

02:59:58.654 --> 03:00:02.000
I mean, it hits with an 18, so 30 to hit?

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.104
MATT: That'll hit, so it does not move.

03:00:04.104 --> 03:00:08.404
MARISHA: And 11 damage.

03:00:08.404 --> 03:00:09.324
LIAM: Thanks, Beauregard.

03:00:09.324 --> 03:00:10.605
ASHLEY: How do we want to do this?

03:00:10.605 --> 03:00:13.265
(laughter)

03:00:13.265 --> 03:00:14.374
MARISHA: I trip it.

03:00:14.374 --> 03:00:17.804
It just bumps its chin real bad.

03:00:17.804 --> 03:00:18.912
TALIESIN: You literally whipped the tide

03:00:18.912 --> 03:00:20.794
for daring to turn without your leave.

03:00:20.794 --> 03:00:22.364
MATT: It goes and tries to dive into the water

03:00:22.364 --> 03:00:25.194
as its tendrils begin to go underneath.

03:00:25.194 --> 03:00:27.954
And as it does, Beau takes a swing with the staff and hits.

03:00:27.954 --> 03:00:30.294
And as it does, its body forms up like a wave.

03:00:30.294 --> 03:00:33.354
And where it's, like, seemingly these faint, glowing orbs

03:00:33.354 --> 03:00:35.979
that float in the water where its face is, readjust

03:00:37.014 --> 03:00:39.134
to where the back of the head was.

03:00:39.134 --> 03:00:41.114
It reforms facing Beauregard.

03:00:41.114 --> 03:00:42.455
You've gotten its attention.

03:00:42.455 --> 03:00:44.294
LAURA: Do its boobs also go from one side

03:00:44.294 --> 03:00:45.734
of its body to the other?

03:00:45.734 --> 03:00:46.947
MATT: Yes, they do.
LAURA: Nice.

03:00:46.947 --> 03:00:49.004
TRAVIS: Creepy, yes, thank you.

03:00:49.004 --> 03:00:51.936
LIAM: Its nipples move through to the other side.

03:00:51.936 --> 03:00:54.402
MATT: All right. It's going to go ahead and take four--

03:00:54.402 --> 03:00:56.877
MARISHA: I wish I could do that. Yeah.

03:00:56.877 --> 03:00:58.904
MATT: -- four attacks with its tendrils.

03:00:58.904 --> 03:01:00.394
LIAM: Oh, damn it.
LAURA: Oh jeez.

03:01:00.394 --> 03:01:04.054
MATT: It's going to be one at Beau, one at Yasha,

03:01:04.054 --> 03:01:05.824
one at Caleb.
LIAM: That's not right.

03:01:05.824 --> 03:01:08.844
MATT: And roll a d6 for me, Laura.

03:01:08.844 --> 03:01:10.424
On a one to three, it goes after you,

03:01:10.424 --> 03:01:13.367
on a four to six, it goes after your duplicate.

03:01:14.454 --> 03:01:15.287
LAURA: Six.

03:01:15.287 --> 03:01:16.120
MATT: So it goes after the duplicates.

03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:18.074
LAURA: Yes!
MATT: So that does miss you.

03:01:18.074 --> 03:01:19.454
And whips to the duplicate.

03:01:19.454 --> 03:01:23.604
However, against Beauregard, that is 24 to hit.

03:01:23.604 --> 03:01:24.444
MARISHA: Yep.

03:01:24.444 --> 03:01:28.667
MATT: Against Yasha, that is 25 to hit.

03:01:29.544 --> 03:01:33.660
And then against Caleb, that is 24 to hit.

03:01:33.660 --> 03:01:34.984
LIAM: That hits.

03:01:34.984 --> 03:01:37.034
MATT: All right.
SAM: Doing a little Ringo Starr.

03:01:37.900 --> 03:01:40.870
(laughter)

03:01:40.870 --> 03:01:45.704
MARISHA: Like that octopus drummer in Aquaman?

03:01:45.704 --> 03:01:47.098
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Yep.

03:01:47.098 --> 03:01:47.931
MARISHA: And you were like,

03:01:47.931 --> 03:01:49.355
"Oh, that's an interesting choice."

03:01:49.355 --> 03:01:50.524
MATT: Beauregard.
LIAM: You were into that.

03:01:50.524 --> 03:01:51.357
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:01:51.357 --> 03:01:53.604
MATT: Beauregard, you take 23 bludgeoning damage.

03:01:53.604 --> 03:01:54.814
MARISHA: 23.

03:01:54.814 --> 03:01:56.667
MATT: And 11 points of acid damage.

03:01:56.667 --> 03:01:57.808
LAURA: Ooh, ooh!
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:01:57.808 --> 03:02:00.434
MARISHA: So for 33 total?
LAURA: It's acid water?

03:02:00.434 --> 03:02:02.664
MATT: The water from its body seems to be caustic

03:02:02.664 --> 03:02:03.984
when it wills it to be so.

03:02:03.984 --> 03:02:06.294
LIAM: That's why the water tasted so funny.

03:02:06.294 --> 03:02:07.816
SAM: It's peeing in the water.

03:02:07.816 --> 03:02:08.779
MATT: That's you.

03:02:08.779 --> 03:02:09.792
MARISHA: Okay.

03:02:09.792 --> 03:02:10.854
MATT: Yasha?

03:02:10.854 --> 03:02:13.594
LAURA: I was swimming in it. I was under pee water.

03:02:13.594 --> 03:02:15.554
MATT: 25 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:02:15.554 --> 03:02:16.387
ASHLEY: Halved?
MATT: Halved.

03:02:16.387 --> 03:02:17.237
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:02:17.237 --> 03:02:20.734
MATT: So only 12 and four points of acid damage.

03:02:20.734 --> 03:02:22.369
TRAVIS: These are big hits, guys.
MARISHA: Yeah, they are.

03:02:22.369 --> 03:02:23.924
MATT: And Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah?

03:02:23.924 --> 03:02:26.544
MATT: You take 18 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:02:26.544 --> 03:02:27.474
LIAM: Okay.

03:02:27.474 --> 03:02:28.874
MATT: And 11 points of acid.

03:02:28.874 --> 03:02:31.044
LIAM: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

03:02:31.044 --> 03:02:33.067
That makes my options clear.

03:02:33.067 --> 03:02:34.385
LAURA: You haven't gone yet, have you?

03:02:34.385 --> 03:02:35.284
LIAM: Nope.

03:02:35.284 --> 03:02:36.117
LAURA: No.

03:02:36.117 --> 03:02:36.974
MATT: I also need to each of you

03:02:36.974 --> 03:02:38.484
to make a strength saving throw.

03:02:38.484 --> 03:02:39.414
LIAM: Oh, this should go well.

03:02:39.414 --> 03:02:40.681
LAURA: Oh no.

03:02:40.681 --> 03:02:43.414
ASHLEY: You have advantage.

03:02:43.414 --> 03:02:45.204
LAURA: I am--

03:02:45.204 --> 03:02:47.274
MATT: She didn't get hit, but you're raging.

03:02:47.274 --> 03:02:48.284
You have advantage.

03:02:48.284 --> 03:02:49.184
ASHLEY: I do.

03:02:49.184 --> 03:02:50.294
MATT: And Beauregard?

03:02:50.294 --> 03:02:52.564
LIAM: I'm so strong.
MARISHA: Oh wait, what? Huh?

03:02:52.564 --> 03:02:53.397
What am I doing?

03:02:53.397 --> 03:02:54.584
(laughter)

03:02:54.584 --> 03:02:55.624
MATT: Strength saving throw.

03:02:55.624 --> 03:02:58.204
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, I was totally thinking

03:02:58.204 --> 03:02:59.857
of how to fight this thing.

03:02:59.857 --> 03:03:02.928
TALIESIN: That's the trouble with being 10 steps ahead.

03:03:02.928 --> 03:03:04.208
MARISHA: 19?

03:03:04.208 --> 03:03:05.053
MATT: Okay.

03:03:05.053 --> 03:03:06.094
LAURA: I've already been left behind.
ASHLEY: 26.

03:03:06.094 --> 03:03:07.154
MATT: 26.

03:03:07.154 --> 03:03:08.774
Both of you guys after being slammed by it,

03:03:08.774 --> 03:03:10.124
the tentacles wrap around you

03:03:10.124 --> 03:03:12.044
and you just manage to push away and squeeze out.

03:03:12.044 --> 03:03:14.474
Caleb, it maintains its grip on you and you are grappled.

03:03:14.474 --> 03:03:16.024
MARISHA: Oh no!
LIAM: Shit.

03:03:16.024 --> 03:03:17.677
Shit, shit.

03:03:18.684 --> 03:03:20.304
MARISHA: That's not good.
MATT: All right.

03:03:20.304 --> 03:03:22.114
Finishing its turn now,

03:03:22.114 --> 03:03:23.634
Caleb and Fjord.

03:03:23.634 --> 03:03:24.724
You're up, but Caleb goes first--

03:03:24.724 --> 03:03:26.137
LIAM: Fjord go first.

03:03:27.714 --> 03:03:29.225
Or I'll go.
TRAVIS: Go.

03:03:33.464 --> 03:03:35.747
LIAM: So I'm in water tentacles?

03:03:36.814 --> 03:03:37.647
MATT: Indeed. Oh, Jester,

03:03:37.647 --> 03:03:38.884
I also need you to roll a d20 for me, please,

03:03:38.884 --> 03:03:39.980
because you cast Polymorph.

03:03:39.980 --> 03:03:41.914
LIAM: Ooh, this is new information.
LAURA: I did.

03:03:41.914 --> 03:03:44.024
SAM: Oh, I also cast a spell, but it didn't work.

03:03:44.024 --> 03:03:44.857
Does that count?

03:03:44.857 --> 03:03:46.334
MATT: Yours was what level? Second level?

03:03:46.334 --> 03:03:47.604
SAM: No, third.

03:03:47.604 --> 03:03:48.714
MATT: So I need you to roll as well.

03:03:48.714 --> 03:03:49.794
LAURA: 16.

03:03:49.794 --> 03:03:51.444
MATT: 16?

03:03:51.444 --> 03:03:52.586
LAURA: It's 17 and up?

03:03:52.586 --> 03:03:54.407
MATT: 17 is the--
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:03:54.407 --> 03:03:55.240
SAM: 18.

03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:57.634
MATT: I need you to roll a d100 for me, Nott.

03:03:57.634 --> 03:03:58.705
TALIESIN: I better get that out.

03:03:58.705 --> 03:03:59.921
SAM: Oh boy!

03:04:01.208 --> 03:04:04.064
MARISHA: Maybe it's something good like the creature

03:04:04.064 --> 03:04:08.083
that you're fighting is teleported to hell.

03:04:08.083 --> 03:04:09.164
SAM: 81.

03:04:09.164 --> 03:04:10.094
MATT: 81.

03:04:10.094 --> 03:04:13.874
LAURA: Oh god, that sounds like it's going to be something.

03:04:13.874 --> 03:04:18.064
MATT: Your size shrinks by one category for one minute.

03:04:18.064 --> 03:04:20.194
You watch as Veth suddenly becomes

03:04:20.194 --> 03:04:22.334
from a medium-sized creature to--

03:04:22.334 --> 03:04:23.584
Oh, no, you're a small creature normally.

03:04:23.584 --> 03:04:25.129
You are now a tiny creature.

03:04:25.129 --> 03:04:26.374
(laughter)

03:04:26.374 --> 03:04:28.067
You're hiding and then--

03:04:28.067 --> 03:04:29.504
(laughter)

03:04:29.504 --> 03:04:33.206
TRAVIS: What does tiny mean?
SAM: (high voice) Guys, what's going on?

03:04:33.206 --> 03:04:35.306
What just happened?
TRAVIS: Like Sprinkle size?

03:04:36.174 --> 03:04:38.754
MATT: Almost, I'd say you're about--

03:04:38.754 --> 03:04:40.449
SAM: Foot and a half?
MATT: About a foot tall.

03:04:40.449 --> 03:04:41.504
LAURA: Oh!
ASHLEY: Oh!

03:04:41.504 --> 03:04:43.326
(laughs)
LAURA: That's so cute.

03:04:43.326 --> 03:04:45.324
SAM: What's happening?

03:04:45.324 --> 03:04:47.765
TRAVIS: Shut up!
LIAM: Oh my god!

03:04:47.765 --> 03:04:48.994
SAM: (short scream)

03:04:48.994 --> 03:04:51.312
MARISHA: Does your crossbow bolt also shrink with you?

03:04:51.312 --> 03:04:52.444
SAM: Everything's tiny.

03:04:52.444 --> 03:04:53.724
(laughter)

03:04:53.724 --> 03:04:56.065
I got to have a little sip of my flask.

03:04:59.144 --> 03:05:01.608
That's a whole half an ounce.

03:05:01.608 --> 03:05:02.608
MATT: All right.

03:05:03.932 --> 03:05:05.134
LIAM: Okay.

03:05:05.134 --> 03:05:05.967
Did I see that?

03:05:05.967 --> 03:05:07.714
Can I see Veth, tiny Veth?

03:05:07.714 --> 03:05:09.010
MATT: You cannot.

03:05:09.010 --> 03:05:12.144
Veth is completely on the opposite side of the room.

03:05:12.144 --> 03:05:14.634
LIAM: Am I being held up in the air or am I down low?

03:05:14.634 --> 03:05:15.854
MATT: You're just where you were standing.

03:05:15.854 --> 03:05:17.684
You're maybe lifted a little bit off the ground

03:05:17.684 --> 03:05:19.004
where it's holding you, but that's it.

03:05:19.004 --> 03:05:22.084
But it is literally blocking your line of sight to Veth.

03:05:22.084 --> 03:05:25.189
LIAM: Okay, this is a dumb move and I'm going to do it.

03:05:25.189 --> 03:05:28.784
I'm going to Teleport right in front of the portal.

03:05:28.784 --> 03:05:30.004
MATT: Okay, with the Teleport spell?

03:05:30.004 --> 03:05:31.382
LIAM: Yes.
SAM: Oh!

03:05:31.382 --> 03:05:32.694
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: (gasps)

03:05:32.694 --> 03:05:34.524
SAM: Oh god.
LAURA: Oh no!

03:05:34.524 --> 03:05:36.254
SAM: Oh no!
LAURA: Oh no!

03:05:36.254 --> 03:05:38.834
TRAVIS: He's taking his chance.
MATT: I need you to one,

03:05:38.834 --> 03:05:40.321
roll a d20 for me.

03:05:41.854 --> 03:05:43.184
LIAM: 18.
LAURA: (gasps)

03:05:43.184 --> 03:05:44.017
Oh no!

03:05:44.017 --> 03:05:46.892
MATT: Okay, So first roll a d100, and then roll a d100.

03:05:46.892 --> 03:05:50.209
(laughter)

03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:52.757
LIAM: 70--

03:05:53.859 --> 03:05:55.373
70.

03:05:55.373 --> 03:05:57.126
MATT: 70, okay.

03:05:57.126 --> 03:05:59.484
And then roll the second d100 for me.

03:05:59.484 --> 03:06:01.274
SAM: This is more d100s than I've ever rolled

03:06:01.274 --> 03:06:02.790
in both campaigns together.

03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:04.744
TRAVIS: 87-- what you roll, 83?

03:06:04.744 --> 03:06:06.714
MARISHA: He went-- an 81.
TRAVIS: 81.

03:06:06.714 --> 03:06:08.034
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Oh my god!

03:06:08.034 --> 03:06:13.034
MATT: So you cast Teleport and shunt out of the space

03:06:13.504 --> 03:06:15.584
and appear right in front of the portal.

03:06:15.584 --> 03:06:17.091
SAM: Oh, great!
LAURA: Good job.

03:06:18.014 --> 03:06:18.994
MATT: Which is awesome.

03:06:18.994 --> 03:06:20.938
LIAM: But I die on the spot.

03:06:20.938 --> 03:06:21.771
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:06:21.771 --> 03:06:24.387
SAM: But your testicles are made of hands.
MATT: Tiny Veth, you look over

03:06:24.387 --> 03:06:26.454
and see Caleb appear.

03:06:26.454 --> 03:06:30.224
And then, his form shifts as well.

03:06:30.224 --> 03:06:31.374
Only now,

03:06:31.374 --> 03:06:33.140
he's a sheep.

03:06:33.140 --> 03:06:34.065
LIAM: Yes!

03:06:34.065 --> 03:06:37.742
(laughter)

03:06:37.742 --> 03:06:38.994
TRAVIS: What?!

03:06:38.994 --> 03:06:40.700
LIAM: Yes!
TRAVIS: What?!

03:06:40.700 --> 03:06:41.882
MATT: I'm going to use this little turtle.

03:06:41.882 --> 03:06:43.173
TRAVIS: No!
MATT: We don't have a sheep,

03:06:43.173 --> 03:06:47.084
but you are polymorphed into a sheep.

03:06:47.084 --> 03:06:48.418
SAM: You sheep shifted?

03:06:48.418 --> 03:06:52.043
(laughter)

03:06:52.043 --> 03:06:53.667
MARISHA: Yes!

03:06:53.667 --> 03:06:54.703
SAM: Wow.

03:06:54.703 --> 03:06:55.869
LAURA: No!

03:06:55.869 --> 03:06:57.352
TALIESIN: Fuck!

03:06:57.352 --> 03:06:59.944
MARISHA: He got baa-anished.

03:06:59.944 --> 03:07:02.254
SAM: He's a sheep shifter.
MATT: But that's your action.

03:07:02.254 --> 03:07:03.584
LIAM: I should still have my movement.

03:07:03.584 --> 03:07:04.884
MATT: You do.

03:07:05.854 --> 03:07:06.921
LIAM: I step into the portal.

03:07:06.921 --> 03:07:10.004
LAURA: No, as a sheep?!
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:07:10.004 --> 03:07:11.544
MATT: You watch, those of you who can see,

03:07:11.544 --> 03:07:13.864
which is Beauregard looking over your shoulder.

03:07:13.864 --> 03:07:14.999
And Yasha.

03:07:14.999 --> 03:07:16.094
(laughter)
TRAVIS: (bleats)

03:07:16.094 --> 03:07:19.292
MATT: Jester, as you look past, you see Caleb land.

03:07:21.033 --> 03:07:22.484
(laughter)
MATT: (bleats)

03:07:22.484 --> 03:07:27.143
And just floats slowly into astral space.

03:07:27.143 --> 03:07:28.376
LIAM: How can I not?

03:07:28.376 --> 03:07:30.111
TRAVIS: Yes, I love it.
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:07:30.111 --> 03:07:31.294
LIAM: How dumb are sheep?

03:07:31.294 --> 03:07:32.892
They got to be real dumb.

03:07:32.892 --> 03:07:34.095
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

03:07:34.974 --> 03:07:36.645
Oh my god.

03:07:36.645 --> 03:07:39.954
LIAM: (laughs)
TRAVIS: (bleats)

03:07:39.954 --> 03:07:40.827
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:07:42.089 --> 03:07:44.024
TRAVIS: In space, no one can hear you bleat.

03:07:44.024 --> 03:07:47.034
(laughter)

03:07:47.034 --> 03:07:48.617
LIAM: Yep, intelligence 2.

03:07:48.617 --> 03:07:50.991
(bleating) Bye!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:07:52.384 --> 03:07:53.784
MATT: All right, that finishes Caleb's go.

03:07:53.784 --> 03:07:55.319
Fjord, you're up.
LAURA: Oh my god!

03:07:55.319 --> 03:07:56.152
TRAVIS: Holy fuck.

03:07:56.152 --> 03:08:00.474
MATT: From your perspective,
Caleb managed to escape the grasp.

03:08:00.474 --> 03:08:01.784
Hell yeah.

03:08:01.784 --> 03:08:02.709
TALIESIN: Help, help.
MATT: What are you doing?

03:08:02.709 --> 03:08:03.725
TRAVIS: Oh no, it's again.

03:08:03.725 --> 03:08:07.241
MARISHA: Am I the only one that saw

03:08:07.241 --> 03:08:08.916
Caleb sheep?
MATT: You, over your shoulder,

03:08:08.916 --> 03:08:10.594
Veth, Jester, and Yasha

03:08:10.594 --> 03:08:12.592
all had line of sight to that.

03:08:12.592 --> 03:08:15.888
Caduceus, Fjord, and Essek did not see this.

03:08:15.888 --> 03:08:17.137
MARISHA: Sheepleb!

03:08:17.137 --> 03:08:19.139
(laughter)

03:08:19.139 --> 03:08:22.781
SAM: Caleb turned into a gigantic sheep!

03:08:22.781 --> 03:08:26.061
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I'll cast Expeditious Retreat

03:08:26.061 --> 03:08:27.304
at 1st-level.

03:08:27.304 --> 03:08:28.137
MATT: You got it.

03:08:28.137 --> 03:08:31.214
TRAVIS: And I will use the dash action to run 60 feet

03:08:31.214 --> 03:08:32.924
around the right side.

03:08:32.924 --> 03:08:34.199
MATT: You've got it,

03:08:34.199 --> 03:08:37.139
which because of your armor, you do not suffer the penalty.

03:08:37.139 --> 03:08:39.584
TRAVIS: Mariner's breastplate.
LAURA: So you're just straight up and out.

03:08:39.584 --> 03:08:41.041
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

03:08:41.041 --> 03:08:42.904
TRAVIS: I don't know if I get all the way there, but--

03:08:42.904 --> 03:08:44.921
LIAM: Should've turned into a sheep.

03:08:46.456 --> 03:08:49.129
Worked for me. (laughs)

03:08:49.129 --> 03:08:50.121
MATT: 55.

03:08:50.121 --> 03:08:51.144
LIAM: Don't be sheepish, get in there.

03:08:51.144 --> 03:08:53.304
MATT: Which means you would be on the portal space.

03:08:53.304 --> 03:08:54.994
If you wanted to you could just,

03:08:54.994 --> 03:08:56.394
with your final five feet, jump in.

03:08:56.394 --> 03:08:57.227
TRAVIS: No, I'll wait.

03:08:57.227 --> 03:08:59.362
SAM: This is <i>shear</i> terror.
MATT: So that's your movement

03:08:59.362 --> 03:09:01.388
and your bonus action.

03:09:01.388 --> 03:09:02.271
TRAVIS: My action--
MARISHA: That's pretty good.

03:09:02.271 --> 03:09:03.419
Yeah, that's a good one.

03:09:03.419 --> 03:09:05.694
TRAVIS: (gum chomping and humming)

03:09:08.510 --> 03:09:10.932
Yeah, that's it. That's my turn.
SAM: You were made for water fights.

03:09:10.932 --> 03:09:12.825
MATT: You're holding your action for anything, or no?

03:09:15.284 --> 03:09:16.354
SAM: You're the water guy.

03:09:16.354 --> 03:09:17.964
MATT: Readying an action, if you want.

03:09:17.964 --> 03:09:19.599
MARISHA: Fuck it, in the portal.

03:09:21.454 --> 03:09:24.354
Caleb's already hoofing it that way.

03:09:24.354 --> 03:09:25.869
LIAM: This is veal bad, you guys.

03:09:25.869 --> 03:09:27.109
TRAVIS: Who's left on the ground?

03:09:27.109 --> 03:09:28.777
It's Jester and--?
LAURA: And Yasha.

03:09:28.777 --> 03:09:30.202
MATT: Jester and Yasha right there.

03:09:30.202 --> 03:09:31.254
Caduceus and Essek.

03:09:31.254 --> 03:09:32.934
TRAVIS: If it attacks Jester or Yasha,

03:09:32.934 --> 03:09:35.154
I'll let out some Eldritch Blast.

03:09:35.154 --> 03:09:36.711
MATT: All right, so you got Eldritch Blast at the ready.

03:09:36.711 --> 03:09:39.003
You got it.
MARISHA: It's veal bad.

03:09:39.003 --> 03:09:42.354
MATT: All right, finishing
Fjord's go, that brings us to Essek.

03:09:42.354 --> 03:09:44.548
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Essek.
SAM: He's got to have some tricks, right?

03:09:47.023 --> 03:09:49.764
MATT: Essek is going to--

03:09:58.708 --> 03:09:59.819
LAURA: (groans)

03:10:01.094 --> 03:10:03.094
MATT: You were saying "help"?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:10:04.490 --> 03:10:06.152
MATT: "(uncertain noise)"

03:10:06.152 --> 03:10:08.534
(laughter)

03:10:08.534 --> 03:10:10.434
MATT: "Well, I guess it's more important

03:10:10.434 --> 03:10:12.364
"that you keep everyone alive."

03:10:12.364 --> 03:10:15.714
He's going to go ahead and wrap his hands

03:10:15.714 --> 03:10:17.737
in an airspace and then put his--

03:10:18.624 --> 03:10:21.424
clenched fingers forward and rush upward like that.

03:10:21.424 --> 03:10:23.724
And as he does, you feel this gust of wind

03:10:23.724 --> 03:10:27.517
as these sparkling arcane wings appear on your back

03:10:27.517 --> 03:10:29.339
and you have Fly on you.

03:10:29.339 --> 03:10:30.986
ALL: Whoa!

03:10:30.986 --> 03:10:32.534
LAURA: Are they pink, are they like unicorn--?

03:10:32.534 --> 03:10:34.371
LIAM: Or are they purple, sparkly dunamancy wings?

03:10:34.371 --> 03:10:35.370
MATT: They're purple, sparkly dunamancy wings.

03:10:35.370 --> 03:10:36.528
LIAM: Yes!

03:10:37.454 --> 03:10:39.224
MATT: So you do have Fly cast on you.

03:10:39.224 --> 03:10:40.057
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

03:10:40.057 --> 03:10:41.534
MATT: He rolls a nine.
LIAM: Goth My Little Pony.

03:10:41.534 --> 03:10:43.824
MATT: So he's okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:10:43.824 --> 03:10:46.864
MATT: And he is going to take his movement.

03:10:46.864 --> 03:10:48.193
ASHLEY: Oh god!

03:10:48.193 --> 03:10:49.964
MATT: 15, that's all he can do.

03:10:49.964 --> 03:10:51.094
He's wading through the water

03:10:51.094 --> 03:10:54.364
and he's like, "Don't forget to return the favor."

03:10:54.364 --> 03:10:55.424
SAM: He can't float on the water?

03:10:55.424 --> 03:10:56.985
TRAVIS: Is Expeditious Retreat the spell--

03:10:56.985 --> 03:11:00.586
SAM: He can't float on the water with his little--

03:11:00.586 --> 03:11:02.564
LIAM: It's a three-inch spell.
MATT: It doesn't quite work like that.

03:11:02.564 --> 03:11:04.194
It keeps him off of solid ground,

03:11:04.194 --> 03:11:06.144
but it doesn't put him over surfaces.

03:11:06.144 --> 03:11:08.634
It's not a levitate type spell.

03:11:08.634 --> 03:11:11.384
TRAVIS: Do I need to roll for Expeditious Retreat?

03:11:11.384 --> 03:11:12.397
MATT: What level spell is that?

03:11:12.397 --> 03:11:13.244
TRAVIS: One.
MATT: I believe it's one.

03:11:13.244 --> 03:11:14.924
No, you're fine.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:11:14.924 --> 03:11:16.424
MATT: All right, so that finishes--

03:11:16.424 --> 03:11:18.114
SAM: You guys both thinking about Devexian?

03:11:18.114 --> 03:11:19.131
Is that what's going on?

03:11:19.131 --> 03:11:20.279
(laughter)

03:11:20.279 --> 03:11:21.336
MATT: Caduceus.

03:11:21.336 --> 03:11:23.529
TALIESIN: What's my speed with flight?

03:11:24.734 --> 03:11:26.654
MATT: So, Fly.

03:11:26.654 --> 03:11:28.547
TRAVIS: Get some ice tea in here!
MARISHA: We just turn into

03:11:28.547 --> 03:11:30.106
the Steel Magnolias cast.
MATT: 60 feet.

03:11:30.106 --> 03:11:32.576
MARISHA: Well, he was just the sweetest man.

03:11:32.576 --> 03:11:36.054
TALIESIN: Can I pick up Essek as I'm flying past?

03:11:36.054 --> 03:11:36.887
MATT: You could, yeah.

03:11:36.887 --> 03:11:38.064
It'll slow down your movement to half,

03:11:38.064 --> 03:11:39.174
but you can do it.

03:11:39.174 --> 03:11:40.864
TALIESIN: But I'll get that first chunk of my movement

03:11:40.864 --> 03:11:41.844
at full speed and then--

03:11:41.844 --> 03:11:42.714
MATT: You will.

03:11:42.714 --> 03:11:47.124
TALIESIN: All right, let's do that.

03:11:47.124 --> 03:11:48.054
MATT: Okay.

03:11:48.054 --> 03:11:49.784
Now, the reason it takes half your movement,

03:11:49.784 --> 03:11:51.334
though he's a relatively light individual,

03:11:51.334 --> 03:11:52.784
you're both waterlogged.

03:11:52.784 --> 03:11:55.784
And so your clothing is very heavy.

03:11:55.784 --> 03:11:59.014
So as you drift up, it does slow your movement in half,

03:11:59.014 --> 03:12:01.304
but you do manage to pick up Essek

03:12:01.304 --> 03:12:06.304
and five, 15, 20, 25, 30.

03:12:06.654 --> 03:12:08.441
You are essentially--

03:12:08.441 --> 03:12:09.300
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:12:09.300 --> 03:12:10.744
Yeah, great.
LAURA: Oh god, directly above him.

03:12:10.744 --> 03:12:12.893
TALIESIN: I would've gone around the side, I think.

03:12:12.893 --> 03:12:14.509
MATT: You'd like to go around the side?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:12:14.509 --> 03:12:16.577
MATT: Which way, over here?
TRAVIS: Towards the tendril.

03:12:16.577 --> 03:12:18.732
TALIESIN: Let's take the left, actually.
MATT: This over here?

03:12:18.732 --> 03:12:19.823
TALIESIN: Everyone keeps taking the right.

03:12:19.823 --> 03:12:21.771
Let's take the left.
MATT: I respect that.

03:12:21.771 --> 03:12:22.604
Okay.

03:12:24.131 --> 03:12:25.394
Put you about there.

03:12:25.394 --> 03:12:28.374
TALIESIN: Yeah, probably wouldn't
be quite that high, but yeah.

03:12:28.374 --> 03:12:29.404
MATT: Okay?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:12:29.404 --> 03:12:31.184
MATT: You get the gist, that was what I used.

03:12:31.184 --> 03:12:32.664
TALIESIN: I'll also say--

03:12:32.664 --> 03:12:34.033
No, never mind, it wouldn't work.

03:12:34.033 --> 03:12:36.064
LIAM: Got to go on the lamb you guys, let's go.

03:12:36.064 --> 03:12:37.524
SAM: (laughs)

03:12:37.524 --> 03:12:38.853
MATT: I'll go ahead and make it not as high.

03:12:38.853 --> 03:12:40.282
TRAVIS: We got a sheep in orbit.

03:12:40.282 --> 03:12:41.964
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:12:41.964 --> 03:12:43.954
MATT: The sheep in orbit.
TRAVIS: Baa!

03:12:43.954 --> 03:12:45.274
MATT: All righty.

03:12:45.274 --> 03:12:48.441
So as you lift, Essek's like-- (screams)

03:12:48.441 --> 03:12:51.134
You're just carrying him up in the air, he's like--

03:12:51.134 --> 03:12:51.967
the wings--

03:12:51.967 --> 03:12:53.697
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't want to die from fall damage.

03:12:53.697 --> 03:12:56.492
MATT: Tentacles are whipping around.

03:12:57.434 --> 03:12:58.267
It'll break some of it.

03:12:58.267 --> 03:12:59.884
That finishes your go, Caduceus?

03:12:59.884 --> 03:13:00.717
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:13:01.877 --> 03:13:04.936
MATT: Yasha, it's your turn.
ASHLEY: Well, hell.

03:13:04.936 --> 03:13:06.027
MATT: Actually, you know what? No.

03:13:06.027 --> 03:13:07.754
At the end of your turn,

03:13:07.754 --> 03:13:09.604
it's going to take a legendary action

03:13:10.984 --> 03:13:13.147
to go ahead and make a slam attack.

03:13:14.424 --> 03:13:16.764
Which right now, the smartest

03:13:16.764 --> 03:13:17.944
would be against you, Caduceus.

03:13:17.944 --> 03:13:18.777
I'm sorry.

03:13:20.374 --> 03:13:23.354
That would be 20.

03:13:23.354 --> 03:13:24.994
TALIESIN: That is my armor class.

03:13:24.994 --> 03:13:27.013
MATT: It does hit you.
LIAM: (groans)

03:13:27.013 --> 03:13:29.534
MATT: So the tentacle, whips up in the air

03:13:29.534 --> 03:13:31.944
and catches you in the side.

03:13:31.944 --> 03:13:32.894
You take--

03:13:32.894 --> 03:13:35.059
ASHLEY: Maybe he'll just hit you into the portal.

03:13:35.059 --> 03:13:36.804
(laughter)

03:13:36.804 --> 03:13:37.657
TALIESIN: Pinball wizard.

03:13:40.164 --> 03:13:42.464
MARISHA: This isn't a new round, is it?

03:13:42.464 --> 03:13:44.504
MATT: 23 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:13:44.504 --> 03:13:45.374
TALIESIN: Cool.

03:13:45.374 --> 03:13:47.674
MATT: And 10 acid.

03:13:47.674 --> 03:13:48.594
TRAVIS: Yasha starts it.

03:13:48.594 --> 03:13:50.544
TALIESIN: That's not cool.

03:13:50.544 --> 03:13:51.969
MATT: All right.

03:13:51.969 --> 03:13:52.928
Yasha, now it's your turn.

03:13:52.928 --> 03:13:54.129
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: Come on, Yasha.

03:13:54.129 --> 03:13:56.003
No more muttoning around.
ASHLEY: We're just going?

03:13:56.003 --> 03:13:58.916
TALIESIN: I mean, you got to get
everybody together, but yeah.

03:13:58.916 --> 03:14:02.795
ASHLEY: I'm going to start booking it into the portal.
MARISHA: Do you think sheep Caleb's eyes are square?

03:14:02.795 --> 03:14:06.556
(laughter)

03:14:06.556 --> 03:14:08.748
TRAVIS: (bleats)

03:14:09.792 --> 03:14:11.074
MATT: 50's your movement, you said?

03:14:11.074 --> 03:14:12.804
ASHLEY: 50's my movement.
TRAVIS: (goat scream)

03:14:12.804 --> 03:14:14.279
MATT: That's your movement there, you still have--

03:14:14.279 --> 03:14:17.604
LIAM: ♪ I knew you were trouble when you walked in ♪
MATT: -- your action and bonus action.

03:14:17.604 --> 03:14:18.720
LAURA: You could just go--

03:14:18.720 --> 03:14:19.977
SAM: ♪ Trouble, trouble ♪

03:14:19.977 --> 03:14:22.224
ASHLEY: Where's my girlfriend?

03:14:22.224 --> 03:14:25.114
MATT: She's 10 feet from you in front on the stairs,

03:14:25.114 --> 03:14:26.694
still facing off with the creature

03:14:26.694 --> 03:14:28.474
which is now faced in that direction.

03:14:28.474 --> 03:14:29.994
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Eyes, face, and boobs and all,

03:14:29.994 --> 03:14:31.324
facing off with Beauregard.
ASHLEY: Great.

03:14:31.324 --> 03:14:33.082
She knows how to handle that.

03:14:34.554 --> 03:14:35.754
I'll jump in.

03:14:35.754 --> 03:14:36.587
MATT: Okay.

03:14:36.587 --> 03:14:38.664
ASHLEY: Rest of my turn.

03:14:38.664 --> 03:14:39.912
MATT: You leap in.

03:14:41.864 --> 03:14:43.664
It <i>now</i> takes its reaction.

03:14:44.844 --> 03:14:47.104
It wasn't worried about the sheep.

03:14:47.104 --> 03:14:48.204
Wasn't too worried with you,

03:14:48.204 --> 03:14:49.894
but you've been a bit of a problem.

03:14:49.894 --> 03:14:51.664
It's going to go ahead and strike out with its reaction

03:14:51.664 --> 03:14:54.262
because it still has it, to try and hit you.

03:14:56.514 --> 03:14:58.747
That would be a twenty...

03:15:00.397 --> 03:15:02.030
five to hit you.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:03.921
MATT: All right, so you take...

03:15:06.505 --> 03:15:08.038
20 points of bludgeoning damage,

03:15:08.038 --> 03:15:10.054
reduced to 10.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:15:10.054 --> 03:15:11.704
MATT: And three points of acid damage

03:15:12.944 --> 03:15:14.009
and I need you to make a strength saving throw.

03:15:14.494 --> 03:15:17.770
LIAM: No, come on. Come on.

03:15:17.770 --> 03:15:19.078
ASHLEY: I have advantage.

03:15:20.514 --> 03:15:23.974
Oh, it's cocked.
I have no room in my box anymore.

03:15:23.974 --> 03:15:25.344
MATT: I know what that's like.
LIAM: Dice!

03:15:25.344 --> 03:15:26.247
ASHLEY: Okay, not bad.

03:15:28.244 --> 03:15:31.294
Ooh, okay, natural 19, so plus 10, so yeah.

03:15:31.294 --> 03:15:32.224
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Nice.

03:15:32.224 --> 03:15:34.704
MATT: It tries to hold onto you as you leap through,

03:15:34.704 --> 03:15:37.024
it catches you and you just kick it off

03:15:37.024 --> 03:15:39.464
and you give way into the space.

03:15:39.464 --> 03:15:41.624
You're now looking back over your shoulder,

03:15:41.624 --> 03:15:42.984
you see this tiny little pocket

03:15:42.984 --> 03:15:45.854
of the inside of the room and just this vast expanse

03:15:45.854 --> 03:15:48.927
of distant, floating, gyrating dark--

03:15:48.927 --> 03:15:50.864
ASHLEY: Do I see a sheep?
MATT: -- and one sheep.

03:15:50.864 --> 03:15:51.812
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:15:51.812 --> 03:15:53.214
MATT: (bleats)

03:15:53.214 --> 03:15:55.694
TRAVIS: And because it tried to attack Yasha or Jester,

03:15:55.694 --> 03:15:56.764
I'll release those Eldritch Blasts.

03:15:56.764 --> 03:15:59.194
MATT: Go for it, three strikes on it.

03:15:59.194 --> 03:16:01.457
TRAVIS: That's 18 to hit.

03:16:01.457 --> 03:16:02.774
MATT: 18 does hit.

03:16:02.774 --> 03:16:06.017
TRAVIS: Okay, second one is a 13, misses.

03:16:07.064 --> 03:16:11.054
And the last one is a 23, so two hit.

03:16:11.054 --> 03:16:11.887
MATT: Indeed.

03:16:13.943 --> 03:16:16.726
TRAVIS: Five, five, eleven.
LIAM: Maybe I could be like the yunie--

03:16:16.726 --> 03:16:20.064
TRAVIS: 22 points of force damage.
MATT: How much?

03:16:20.064 --> 03:16:21.497
TRAVIS: 22 total.
MATT: 22, nice.

03:16:22.585 --> 03:16:25.514
(impacts) Like small depth charges, both of them

03:16:25.514 --> 03:16:28.234
sink into the middle of the water about a foot

03:16:28.234 --> 03:16:30.264
into its body and then (small explosions) on the inside,

03:16:30.264 --> 03:16:32.044
giving this flash of light and you can see

03:16:32.044 --> 03:16:35.694
the impact bubble before it finds itself

03:16:35.694 --> 03:16:37.624
back to median.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:16:37.624 --> 03:16:39.744
MATT: Awesome, that finishes your reaction on there.

03:16:39.744 --> 03:16:43.686
Finishes Yasha's go. Jester, you're up. Beau, on deck.

03:16:43.686 --> 03:16:44.519
LAURA: Okay.

03:16:45.624 --> 03:16:49.114
I'm going to move and try to get up to the portal area.

03:16:49.114 --> 03:16:49.947
MATT: Okay.

03:16:51.414 --> 03:16:55.424
LIAM: That is such a big--
LAURA: I mean, it's so huge.

03:16:55.424 --> 03:16:57.404
MATT: Right there, that's your movement.

03:16:57.404 --> 03:16:59.095
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: You're like (splashing).

03:16:59.095 --> 03:17:00.954
LIAM: You want to dash?
MARISHA: Yeah, double it up.

03:17:00.954 --> 03:17:02.404
Go, go, go, go.
LAURA: Double it up.

03:17:02.404 --> 03:17:03.824
Would I be able to make it through the portal

03:17:03.824 --> 03:17:05.987
if I doubled it, if I dashed?

03:17:07.714 --> 03:17:08.894
MATT: You may.

03:17:08.894 --> 03:17:10.054
MARISHA: Out of water? Is she out of the water?

03:17:10.054 --> 03:17:12.154
LAURA: I'll use my action to get up.

03:17:12.154 --> 03:17:13.694
MATT: Yeah, you'd be out of water
on there, so it wouldn't be--

03:17:13.694 --> 03:17:15.124
LAURA: Okay, yeah, then...

03:17:17.931 --> 03:17:21.938
I'll get up to it.

03:17:21.938 --> 03:17:24.254
MATT: You can jump in or you could stay, up to you.

03:17:24.254 --> 03:17:29.169
LAURA: I'm going to use... (nervous chittering)

03:17:30.608 --> 03:17:31.933
(heavy sigh)

03:17:34.348 --> 03:17:35.398
(uncertain sound)

03:17:36.612 --> 03:17:38.458
MARISHA: You can fly, right?
TALIESIN: At the moment.

03:17:38.458 --> 03:17:40.664
LAURA: But we might be down a cleric.

03:17:40.664 --> 03:17:42.297
I'm going to stay off to the side.

03:17:43.344 --> 03:17:44.177
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Not jumping in?

03:17:44.177 --> 03:17:45.504
LAURA: I'm not jumping in,

03:17:45.504 --> 03:17:49.274
just in case somebody goes down and Caduceus is out.

03:17:49.274 --> 03:17:51.594
MATT: Okay, so you and Fjord are currently just settled

03:17:51.594 --> 03:17:53.984
right on the edge of the portal.
LAURA: Yeah, I'll be on the opposite,

03:17:53.984 --> 03:17:55.673
on the other side of the portal from Fjord.

03:17:55.673 --> 03:17:56.589
MATT: Okay, as you both stand there,

03:17:56.589 --> 03:17:59.342
there's this very faint sensation of the wind

03:17:59.342 --> 03:18:01.254
rushing past you into the space behind,

03:18:01.254 --> 03:18:04.574
both your hair is being blown in that direction

03:18:04.574 --> 03:18:06.047
as you look at each other, just.

03:18:07.534 --> 03:18:09.674
LAURA: I'm going to try to make it--

03:18:09.674 --> 03:18:11.224
I'm going to have my duplicate

03:18:11.224 --> 03:18:16.224
get underneath Caduceus and Essek just in case they fall,

03:18:16.544 --> 03:18:18.644
I'll be able to get to them really quickly.

03:18:18.644 --> 03:18:21.544
MATT: You got it. All right, that finishes your go, Jester.

03:18:21.544 --> 03:18:23.408
Beauregard, you're up. Veth, you're on deck.

03:18:23.408 --> 03:18:25.764
Veth, you're on deck.

03:18:25.764 --> 03:18:27.034
MARISHA: We running? We good?

03:18:27.034 --> 03:18:29.454
Because if so, I'm going to go.

03:18:29.454 --> 03:18:32.357
I'm going to start darting towards the portal.

03:18:33.528 --> 03:18:35.494
I'm still in combat with it?

03:18:35.494 --> 03:18:38.624
MATT: You are. You're in melee with it, yeah.

03:18:38.624 --> 03:18:40.134
MARISHA: Can I tell if it's looking rough?

03:18:40.134 --> 03:18:42.604
TRAVIS: Are you grappled?
MATT: It's hard to tell

03:18:42.604 --> 03:18:44.264
on a massive water creature.
MARISHA: No idea?

03:18:44.264 --> 03:18:45.574
MATT: It's taking some hits like a champ

03:18:45.574 --> 03:18:48.201
and doesn't appear to be changing its behavior, so.

03:18:48.201 --> 03:18:50.244
LIAM: That thing is a mess.
TALIESIN: Not yet.

03:18:50.244 --> 03:18:52.494
MATT: Not. Yet.

03:18:52.494 --> 03:18:55.054
TALIESIN: It's not a construct, is it? Technically?

03:18:55.054 --> 03:18:56.724
MATT: You think probably not.

03:18:56.724 --> 03:18:59.074
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm figuring out some shit.

03:18:59.074 --> 03:19:00.847
MATT: No, totally, totally. So, Beau?

03:19:01.954 --> 03:19:05.634
MARISHA: I am going to Step of the Wind to disengage.

03:19:05.634 --> 03:19:08.244
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: So it doesn't hit me.

03:19:08.244 --> 03:19:09.624
MATT: It did already use its reaction.

03:19:09.624 --> 03:19:11.094
MARISHA: Oh, it already used its reaction? Oh.

03:19:11.094 --> 03:19:12.334
MATT: To strike for Yasha.

03:19:12.334 --> 03:19:13.929
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. Well then, great.

03:19:13.929 --> 03:19:15.712
Then I'll just not do that.

03:19:15.712 --> 03:19:17.186
I'll save a ki point.
ASHLEY: I did that on purpose.

03:19:17.186 --> 03:19:19.265
Anything for my princess!

03:19:19.265 --> 03:19:23.722
(laughter)

03:19:23.722 --> 03:19:25.794
(laughter)

03:19:25.794 --> 03:19:27.253
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:19:27.253 --> 03:19:28.567
MATT: I love you so much, Ashley.

03:19:29.502 --> 03:19:30.826
TRAVIS: [inaudible]

03:19:30.826 --> 03:19:34.477
LIAM: Princess punch.
MARISHA: Anything for my princess.

03:19:34.477 --> 03:19:36.552
MATT: Ha ha. Ha ha.

03:19:36.552 --> 03:19:38.335
ASHLEY: Ah ha ha ha ha.

03:19:38.335 --> 03:19:40.184
MATT: All right, anyway, enough "Room" jokes.

03:19:40.184 --> 03:19:41.134
Beauregard, what're you doing?

03:19:41.134 --> 03:19:43.586
LIAM: I like the Tin Man.

03:19:43.586 --> 03:19:45.874
MARISHA: I run up to where Fjord and Jester are.

03:19:45.874 --> 03:19:47.879
TRAVIS: Hi, doggie!
MATT: All right.

03:19:49.064 --> 03:19:50.787
MARISHA: I look at them.

03:19:53.074 --> 03:19:54.397
Right behind me, yeah?

03:19:55.264 --> 03:19:56.947
And I jump in.

03:19:58.841 --> 03:20:02.651
MATT: You jump into the space. You vanish from view.

03:20:04.364 --> 03:20:05.794
It's the same thing, you glance out

03:20:05.794 --> 03:20:07.664
a little bit after Yasha as you both catch

03:20:07.664 --> 03:20:10.234
at the same trajectory, just floating there,

03:20:10.234 --> 03:20:11.574
looking at each other and looking back

03:20:11.574 --> 03:20:14.414
at the whipping whirlwind of water in the chamber

03:20:14.414 --> 03:20:15.864
where you previously were, where you see

03:20:15.864 --> 03:20:17.924
the backs of Jester and Fjord looking back towards you

03:20:17.924 --> 03:20:19.464
as they focus back on the inside of the chamber,

03:20:19.464 --> 03:20:20.649
hoping the rest of your friends can make it.

03:20:20.649 --> 03:20:22.314
MARISHA: And a sheep.
MATT: And a little, baa!

03:20:22.314 --> 03:20:25.194
MARISHA: It's like that beautiful scene
from Across the Universe,

03:20:25.194 --> 03:20:28.094
but then also a sheep is there.
MATT: But also a sheep, yeah, basically.

03:20:28.094 --> 03:20:29.494
All right, that finish your turn, Beau?

03:20:29.494 --> 03:20:31.577
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All right, Veth, you're up.

03:20:33.314 --> 03:20:35.947
SAM: In the contraption with the rods.

03:20:35.947 --> 03:20:37.205
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:20:37.205 --> 03:20:39.484
SAM: There's a rod in it still?

03:20:39.484 --> 03:20:40.625
MATT: There is.

03:20:43.234 --> 03:20:46.354
SAM: I just wonder if we should close the door

03:20:46.354 --> 03:20:48.674
on our way through or no.

03:20:48.674 --> 03:20:49.803
TALIESIN: I don't think that's possible.

03:20:49.803 --> 03:20:53.379
MARISHA: Can we?
LAURA: I don't know.

03:20:53.379 --> 03:20:54.254
MATT: You can make an arcana check

03:20:54.254 --> 03:20:56.307
if you want to see if that's something possible.

03:20:59.914 --> 03:21:01.824
SAM: Sure, I'll make an arcana check.

03:21:01.824 --> 03:21:02.657
MATT: Go for it.

03:21:03.834 --> 03:21:05.479
SAM: Four.
MATT: Four.

03:21:05.479 --> 03:21:06.954
(laughter)

03:21:06.954 --> 03:21:07.964
Possible.

03:21:07.964 --> 03:21:09.294
LIAM: Try to Mage Hand it on the way out.

03:21:09.294 --> 03:21:10.662
SAM: That's what I was going to do.
LIAM: But you got to

03:21:10.662 --> 03:21:13.084
do it once everyone's through.

03:21:13.084 --> 03:21:16.354
SAM: Yeah, I'm so--

03:21:16.354 --> 03:21:19.084
I want to stay and help them through,

03:21:19.084 --> 03:21:23.374
but I feel like, between Jester and Fjord.

03:21:23.374 --> 03:21:24.207
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:21:24.207 --> 03:21:27.024
SAM: They've got enough to get through.

03:21:27.024 --> 03:21:29.494
Both of you can do bamf-y things.

03:21:29.494 --> 03:21:31.384
MARISHA: It starts becoming a chicken and egg thing.

03:21:31.384 --> 03:21:33.644
SAM: Yeah, so I feel like I should just go.

03:21:33.644 --> 03:21:38.274
I'll cast Mage Hand and just leave it hovering near the rod.

03:21:38.274 --> 03:21:39.107
MATT: Okay.

03:21:39.107 --> 03:21:43.946
SAM: And I will climb up and into the portal.

03:21:43.946 --> 03:21:46.029
(laughter)

03:21:47.509 --> 03:21:48.342
(high-pitched) Come on!

03:21:48.342 --> 03:21:50.372
MATT: As opposed to a giant leap!
TRAVIS: Ugh!

03:21:50.372 --> 03:21:52.439
(laughter)
Fucking--

03:21:52.439 --> 03:21:54.675
(laughter)

03:21:54.675 --> 03:21:55.834
MATT: It's like you suddenly realize you got brushed

03:21:55.834 --> 03:21:58.071
by the chupacabra.
TRAVIS: Fuck this place!

03:21:58.071 --> 03:22:00.371
LIAM: Man, putting tiny Vax to shame.

03:22:01.296 --> 03:22:03.937
SAM: (high-pitched giggle)

03:22:03.937 --> 03:22:07.044
LIAM: You're like a baseball.

03:22:07.044 --> 03:22:10.684
MATT: That's really creepy.
Okay, does that finish your turn?

03:22:10.684 --> 03:22:11.517
SAM: Yeah.

03:22:11.517 --> 03:22:12.644
MATT: You're now floating through space,

03:22:12.644 --> 03:22:14.691
catching up with the two of them and a sheep.

03:22:14.691 --> 03:22:15.754
LIAM: Baa.

03:22:15.754 --> 03:22:17.475
MATT: You got it. All right, finishing Veth's go.

03:22:17.475 --> 03:22:19.684
LAURA: Veth is really far away from us!

03:22:19.684 --> 03:22:21.723
(laughter)

03:22:21.723 --> 03:22:22.775
LIAM: How did she get ahead?

03:22:22.775 --> 03:22:26.083
SAM: (high-pitched) It's perspective,
I'm right next to you!

03:22:26.943 --> 03:22:28.134
MATT: It's going to go ahead and move--

03:22:28.134 --> 03:22:28.967
LAURA: Oh no.

03:22:28.967 --> 03:22:30.477
MATT: -- in a little bit closer there.
LIAM: Oof.

03:22:30.477 --> 03:22:32.822
MATT: Angrily, it's going to go ahead
and take four more strikes.

03:22:32.822 --> 03:22:33.857
SAM: Oh, jesus.
LIAM: Oh, mama.

03:22:33.857 --> 03:22:36.140
LAURA: All right.
SAM: If it grapples all of these fuckers.

03:22:36.140 --> 03:22:37.544
LIAM: Oh, mama.

03:22:37.544 --> 03:22:40.140
MATT: It's going to take a strike at you, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

03:22:40.140 --> 03:22:43.424
MATT: It's going to take a strike at Fjord,

03:22:43.424 --> 03:22:46.294
a strike at Jester, and a strike at Essek.

03:22:46.294 --> 03:22:47.344
One of each.
LAURA: Is it going to try for my

03:22:47.344 --> 03:22:48.402
duplicate again, or?

03:22:48.402 --> 03:22:49.684
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll for the duplicate

03:22:49.684 --> 03:22:52.154
to see if it goes after one or the other.

03:22:52.154 --> 03:22:52.987
LAURA: Five!
MATT: Five.

03:22:52.987 --> 03:22:54.828
It goes after the duplicate.
Jester, you are free.

03:22:54.828 --> 03:22:57.045
SAM: All right, we've got one person.
MATT: As it swings once more,

03:22:57.045 --> 03:23:00.657
swiping at the nonexistent, technically, Jester Lavorre.

03:23:00.657 --> 03:23:02.584
SAM: (like Jester) Technically.
MATT: (like Jester) Technically.

03:23:02.584 --> 03:23:03.876
Swinging for you, Fjord.
SAM: You fleeced him!

03:23:03.876 --> 03:23:04.709
ASHLEY: Technically, it's not me.

03:23:04.709 --> 03:23:07.544
MATT: That is a 27.
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.

03:23:08.519 --> 03:23:12.184
MATT: Against you, Caduceus,

03:23:12.184 --> 03:23:13.924
that is a 19.

03:23:13.924 --> 03:23:16.904
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I have a reaction to that.

03:23:16.904 --> 03:23:18.014
MATT: Okay.

03:23:18.014 --> 03:23:20.299
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
TRAVIS: I'm appalled!

03:23:20.299 --> 03:23:22.573
(laughter)

03:23:22.573 --> 03:23:25.492
TALIESIN: How dare you? How dare you?

03:23:25.492 --> 03:23:27.583
(laughter)

03:23:27.583 --> 03:23:32.470
I've encountered many bodies of water in my life, but never!

03:23:33.499 --> 03:23:36.074
MATT: Man, grave clerics get all the good abilities.

03:23:37.229 --> 03:23:38.424
Technically, Cutting Words does well.

03:23:38.424 --> 03:23:42.914
TALIESIN: I'm going to retort with 4d6 force damage.

03:23:42.914 --> 03:23:46.084
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Two, three, four.

03:23:46.084 --> 03:23:50.044
And they have to succeed a strength saving throw.

03:23:50.044 --> 03:23:50.877
MATT: Okay.

03:23:53.654 --> 03:23:54.617
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

03:23:56.774 --> 03:23:58.624
20 points of force damage.
MATT: Nice.

03:23:58.624 --> 03:24:01.024
TALIESIN: That went well.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:24:01.024 --> 03:24:02.224
MATT: All righty, and a strength saving throw?

03:24:02.224 --> 03:24:03.414
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:24:03.414 --> 03:24:07.044
MATT: That is going to be 16.

03:24:07.044 --> 03:24:11.304
TALIESIN: I think it's off of my spell AC, which is 18.

03:24:11.304 --> 03:24:12.334
MATT: 18, so that'd be a fail.

03:24:12.334 --> 03:24:15.464
It's going to use a Legendary Resistance to succeed.

03:24:15.464 --> 03:24:16.997
TALIESIN: Awesome, how many-- wow.

03:24:17.894 --> 03:24:19.464
Two, three Legendary Resistances?

03:24:19.464 --> 03:24:22.864
Okay, we're at two Legendary Resistances now, right?

03:24:22.864 --> 03:24:24.854
MATT: All righty, as the shield flashes

03:24:24.854 --> 03:24:28.414
and you see the water form in itself hold strong

03:24:28.414 --> 03:24:30.724
like a bulwark until the shield flashes,

03:24:30.724 --> 03:24:33.164
and you watch as its shoulders dent inward

03:24:33.164 --> 03:24:35.544
for a moment before it has to reform

03:24:35.544 --> 03:24:37.984
the space where the impact blasted it.

03:24:37.984 --> 03:24:40.674
All right, and the last one is going to be Essek,

03:24:40.674 --> 03:24:43.374
which, a natural 19, that hits.

03:24:43.374 --> 03:24:44.244
LIAM: Ooh!

03:24:44.244 --> 03:24:46.764
MATT: All right, so Fjord, you take

03:24:47.914 --> 03:24:49.174
23 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:24:49.174 --> 03:24:52.264
TRAVIS: Woo, baby!
MATT: And four points of acid.

03:24:52.264 --> 03:24:53.772
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:24:53.772 --> 03:24:55.856
MATT: And Essek takes--

03:24:55.856 --> 03:24:57.504
Ooh, that's not good--

03:24:57.504 --> 03:24:59.244
29 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:24:59.244 --> 03:25:01.299
LIAM: (like Arnold Schwarzenegger)
Get to the portal!

03:25:02.984 --> 03:25:05.787
MATT: And two points of acid damage.

03:25:06.696 --> 03:25:08.904
Essek's looking a little rough.

03:25:08.904 --> 03:25:12.504
As he takes the hit, he's like,
"Ah! (coughing)" And begins coughing.

03:25:12.504 --> 03:25:13.834
I need you to make a strength saving throw.

03:25:13.834 --> 03:25:14.817
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: Oh god.

03:25:16.009 --> 03:25:17.317
LIAM: Should've gone sheep.

03:25:18.974 --> 03:25:20.690
TRAVIS: 21.
MATT: 21, you succeed.

03:25:20.690 --> 03:25:22.924
Essek, with a natural three, does not.

03:25:22.924 --> 03:25:24.664
LIAM: I didn't lose my hair, I got more.

03:25:24.664 --> 03:25:27.724
SAM: Oh, Essek is grappled?
MATT: Essek is grappled.

03:25:27.724 --> 03:25:29.501
TRAVIS: ♪ Natural 19! ♪

03:25:29.501 --> 03:25:33.864
MATT: So you are now clutching him, and you can't move

03:25:33.864 --> 03:25:35.124
as long as you're holding onto him

03:25:35.124 --> 03:25:38.664
as the creature has a strong hold on Essek Thelyss.

03:25:38.664 --> 03:25:40.924
TRAVIS: Can that fucker teleport or anything?

03:25:40.924 --> 03:25:44.402
TALIESIN: We'll find out.
MATT: All right, that finishes his turn.

03:25:44.402 --> 03:25:46.902
SAM: Maybe he had it coming.
MATT: Now we come to Caleb.

03:25:48.024 --> 03:25:50.354
You're a sheep.
LIAM: (bleats)

03:25:50.354 --> 03:25:52.247
MATT: Fjord, your turn.

03:25:54.174 --> 03:25:56.374
TRAVIS: And you're not grappled?
TALIESIN: I am not.

03:25:56.374 --> 03:25:57.874
TRAVIS: But Essek is.
TALIESIN: But Essek is.

03:25:57.874 --> 03:26:00.654
TRAVIS: And he's up in the air?
TALIESIN: Not high, but yes.

03:26:00.654 --> 03:26:04.114
MATT: Yeah, about 15 feet up in the air,
being held by Caduceus,

03:26:04.114 --> 03:26:07.084
who now is trying to hold and pull, his wings flapping hard,

03:26:07.084 --> 03:26:09.844
and Essek's just grabbed by him, and Essek's like (groans),

03:26:09.844 --> 03:26:13.504
just reeling from the pain of the crush and the acid burn.

03:26:13.504 --> 03:26:17.454
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to picture it,
so if I waded out to him,

03:26:17.454 --> 03:26:20.004
would I be able to jump up and reach him at all,

03:26:20.004 --> 03:26:21.334
if he's 15 feet in the air?

03:26:21.334 --> 03:26:22.624
MATT: 15 feet's a pretty high jump,

03:26:22.624 --> 03:26:25.184
especially from water, even with your armor.

03:26:25.184 --> 03:26:29.074
LAURA: Can you aim at the tentacles that's holding him?

03:26:29.074 --> 03:26:31.574
TRAVIS: I don't know if that'll drop him, though.

03:26:31.574 --> 03:26:33.974
MATT: You could certainly try.
TRAVIS: I certainly could.

03:26:35.671 --> 03:26:38.624
MATT: It's D&amp;D: If you can imagine it,
you can certainly try.

03:26:38.624 --> 03:26:39.457
TRAVIS: That's right.

03:26:39.457 --> 03:26:41.315
TALIESIN: ♪ [inaudible] ♪
Oh wait.

03:26:42.224 --> 03:26:44.324
TRAVIS: It's not a bad idea, actually.

03:26:44.324 --> 03:26:45.534
I do hate to stay here, though,

03:26:45.534 --> 03:26:47.987
and this is my whole fucking movement.

03:26:47.987 --> 03:26:50.308
I'm here for another round.

03:26:53.517 --> 03:26:54.410
Balls.

03:26:58.734 --> 03:27:00.142
My hit points.

03:27:00.984 --> 03:27:02.259
MATT: It's your call.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:27:02.259 --> 03:27:06.144
I'll fire three Eldritch Blasts at the tentacle.

03:27:06.144 --> 03:27:08.245
MATT: Okay, because you are
aiming specifically at a tentacle,

03:27:08.245 --> 03:27:10.744
it does have a higher AC than the creature's base AC,

03:27:10.744 --> 03:27:12.684
because you're aiming at a very specific part.

03:27:12.684 --> 03:27:15.674
So as opposed to aiming for the 17, you are aiming for a 22.

03:27:15.674 --> 03:27:16.507
Go ahead and roll.

03:27:16.507 --> 03:27:17.984
TRAVIS: At disadvantage, or just regular rolls?

03:27:17.984 --> 03:27:19.824
MATT: Just regular rolls at a 22.

03:27:19.824 --> 03:27:22.241
TRAVIS: That's off the table.
SAM: ♪ Regular rolls, regular rolls. ♪

03:27:24.483 --> 03:27:25.316
TRAVIS: 13 plus--

03:27:25.316 --> 03:27:26.573
MARISHA: All the way back to the beginning.

03:27:26.573 --> 03:27:27.644
LIAM: Yeah.

03:27:27.644 --> 03:27:29.904
TRAVIS: 10 is 23.
MATT: 23 hits.

03:27:29.904 --> 03:27:30.834
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:27:30.834 --> 03:27:33.571
SAM: What if this city is just no rules.
TRAVIS: That's a four.

03:27:33.571 --> 03:27:34.662
Ah! God, jesus.

03:27:34.662 --> 03:27:36.594
TALIESIN: Just rock and roll.
MARISHA: Just going bowling.

03:27:36.594 --> 03:27:38.254
TRAVIS: That's a natural one.

03:27:38.254 --> 03:27:40.247
MATT: Okay, so one hit.
TRAVIS: One hit.

03:27:44.854 --> 03:27:48.344
11 points of force damage.
MATT: 11 points of force damage.

03:27:48.344 --> 03:27:49.504
It hits it and you watch the tentacle

03:27:49.504 --> 03:27:52.504
bursts a bit on one side, but it holds true.

03:27:52.504 --> 03:27:54.484
The other two, unfortunately, go wide.

03:27:54.484 --> 03:27:57.634
It's not enough to sever its connection to Essek Thelyss.

03:27:57.634 --> 03:27:59.134
TRAVIS: I can't make myself a liability.

03:27:59.134 --> 03:28:00.734
I back up through the portal.

03:28:00.734 --> 03:28:02.924
SAM: Oh, you're just gone?

03:28:02.924 --> 03:28:04.164
TRAVIS: My hit points are too low

03:28:04.164 --> 03:28:06.441
and I can't stay here for another round.

03:28:06.441 --> 03:28:08.924
MATT: Fjord is now drifting out in the Astral Sea

03:28:08.924 --> 03:28:10.457
with the rest of the Mighty Nein.
TRAVIS: If I could've touched him,

03:28:10.457 --> 03:28:12.054
I could've done one thing, but.

03:28:12.054 --> 03:28:13.820
MATT: All right, that finishes Fjord's go.

03:28:13.820 --> 03:28:16.354
LIAM: We don't want to be Thelyss.
MATT: It is now Essek's.

03:28:16.354 --> 03:28:18.787
Essek, as you're holding on, is just like,

03:28:20.051 --> 03:28:23.214
"Don't worry, we've all got tricks up our sleeve."

03:28:23.214 --> 03:28:24.174
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

03:28:24.174 --> 03:28:26.624
MATT: He's going to bonus action cast Misty Step.

03:28:26.624 --> 03:28:27.774
LIAM: There we go.
LAURA: Nice.

03:28:28.704 --> 03:28:30.317
TRAVIS: That's clutch.

03:28:31.184 --> 03:28:35.687
MATT: Vanish out and appear right
in the space where Fjord was.

03:28:37.004 --> 03:28:39.624
Just drifting off the ground a bit,

03:28:39.624 --> 03:28:41.341
looks over at Jester.

03:28:41.341 --> 03:28:43.464
"Let's make it quick."
LAURA: Go.

03:28:43.464 --> 03:28:45.714
MATT: And then just glides into it and begins,

03:28:45.714 --> 03:28:47.734
just continues his gliding outward,

03:28:47.734 --> 03:28:49.887
almost like he just drifted into a fly.

03:28:50.744 --> 03:28:52.188
All right.

03:28:52.188 --> 03:28:53.847
LAURA: I'm going to shout from my duplicate:

03:28:53.847 --> 03:28:56.097
Come on, Caduceus!

03:28:56.097 --> 03:28:57.305
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: Nice.

03:28:57.305 --> 03:28:59.591
MATT: Okay, finishing Essek's turn.

03:28:59.591 --> 03:29:00.904
LIAM: Jester.
MATT: Caduceus.

03:29:00.904 --> 03:29:03.144
TALIESIN: Bonus action, turn invisible.

03:29:03.144 --> 03:29:04.444
MATT: Bonus action, turn invisible, you got it.

03:29:04.444 --> 03:29:08.044
TALIESIN: And I'm going to try
to make a beeline with my movement

03:29:08.044 --> 03:29:09.294
towards the portal.

03:29:09.294 --> 03:29:11.955
MATT: That is smart as fuck,
because it cannot make a reaction

03:29:11.955 --> 03:29:13.240
attacking something it cannot see.
TRAVIS: Nice!

03:29:13.240 --> 03:29:17.232
ASHLEY: Nicely done!
TRAVIS: Fucking Caduceus! Caduceus!

03:29:17.232 --> 03:29:19.767
TALIESIN: Does my reaction get me all the way to the portal?

03:29:20.614 --> 03:29:21.484
SAM: Your movement?

03:29:21.484 --> 03:29:22.895
TALIESIN: Does my movement get me all the way to the portal?

03:29:22.895 --> 03:29:24.261
MATT: You have a movement of 60 right now,

03:29:24.261 --> 03:29:25.889
because you're no longer holding Essek.

03:29:25.889 --> 03:29:26.974
TALIESIN: Because I'm no longer holding Essek.

03:29:26.974 --> 03:29:28.744
So on my way out...

03:29:31.494 --> 03:29:32.714
SAM: You're going to draw a dick.

03:29:32.714 --> 03:29:34.016
MATT: However, actually, this is a valid point.

03:29:34.016 --> 03:29:35.591
Essek did take damage.

03:29:37.244 --> 03:29:41.201
He took 31 damage. We'll see if he drops the Fly spell.

03:29:41.201 --> 03:29:42.124
LAURA: Oh, right.

03:29:42.124 --> 03:29:43.864
MARISHA: Does he have War Caster? He does, right?

03:29:43.864 --> 03:29:45.422
MATT: He does, so he gets--

03:29:45.422 --> 03:29:47.389
which is good, because his first roll was a three.

03:29:48.564 --> 03:29:49.997
That'll do it, natural 18.

03:29:49.997 --> 03:29:51.377
LIAM: Yes!
TRAVIS: Fuckin' A.

03:29:51.377 --> 03:29:53.779
LIAM: Yessek!
ASHLEY: Yessek!

03:29:53.779 --> 03:29:57.967
MATT: He maintains concentration on Fly.

03:29:57.967 --> 03:29:59.324
You remain able to make this turn.

03:29:59.324 --> 03:30:01.294
So as you glide towards the portal, invisible,

03:30:01.294 --> 03:30:04.154
you turn around at the last minute. What are you doing?

03:30:04.154 --> 03:30:05.917
TALIESIN: Is Jester the last one here?

03:30:05.917 --> 03:30:07.944
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Both of them.

03:30:07.944 --> 03:30:11.074
TALIESIN: I'm just going to tap a
Bless on my way out, just to--

03:30:11.074 --> 03:30:13.987
Actually, how do you look? Do you look fucking rough?

03:30:13.987 --> 03:30:15.194
LAURA: I don't look fucking rough.

03:30:15.194 --> 03:30:18.706
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to tap a
Bless on you on the way out.

03:30:18.706 --> 03:30:20.598
LIAM: Tap that Bless.
LAURA: Tap that Bless!

03:30:20.598 --> 03:30:22.464
TALIESIN: Tap that Bless.
SAM: Oh boy, Jessie.

03:30:22.464 --> 03:30:25.192
MATT: Okay. Essek.
SAM: Get through that door.

03:30:25.192 --> 03:30:27.244
LIAM: Don't do another Happy Fun Ball, please.
MATT: Essek gets through the door.

03:30:27.244 --> 03:30:28.894
LAURA: I know, right?
MATT: There you go.

03:30:29.994 --> 03:30:32.574
All right, that brings us around,

03:30:32.574 --> 03:30:35.294
as everyone else is drifting, Jester, it's your turn.

03:30:35.294 --> 03:30:39.147
You and your duplicate now stand confronting this

03:30:39.147 --> 03:30:43.644
angry elemental monstrosity.

03:30:43.644 --> 03:30:44.594
What are you doing?

03:30:46.534 --> 03:30:50.572
LAURA: I'm going to say: It's just you and me, Titties.

03:30:50.572 --> 03:30:51.774
(laughter)

03:30:51.774 --> 03:30:55.954
And I'm going to make my duplicate step up in front of me

03:30:55.954 --> 03:30:58.984
and have a standoff with it like she's putting up her dukes.

03:30:58.984 --> 03:31:01.034
She's going to pull out a handaxe

03:31:01.034 --> 03:31:02.584
and act like she's about to fight it

03:31:02.584 --> 03:31:05.034
as I back up and try to bamf through the door.

03:31:05.034 --> 03:31:06.844
MATT: Okay, it does have its reaction back.

03:31:06.844 --> 03:31:07.677
LAURA: I know.

03:31:07.677 --> 03:31:09.624
MATT: So it's going to go ahead and take a swipe,

03:31:09.624 --> 03:31:11.374
and since you're the one stepping out of range,

03:31:11.374 --> 03:31:13.404
not the duplicate, it is not--

03:31:13.404 --> 03:31:16.624
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: -- fooled, because it's reacting

03:31:16.624 --> 03:31:18.874
to the one that moves out of its 20-foot combat range.

03:31:18.874 --> 03:31:20.111
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Which its tentacles allow.

03:31:20.111 --> 03:31:22.514
TRAVIS: 20-foot combat range!
LAURA: That's fine.

03:31:22.514 --> 03:31:24.034
LIAM: Those titties have a long reach.

03:31:24.034 --> 03:31:25.254
MATT: As soon as she leaps through the portal,

03:31:25.254 --> 03:31:26.394
it attacks her through the portal.

03:31:26.394 --> 03:31:28.104
You make it through.

03:31:28.104 --> 03:31:30.704
You jump, and about five feet, a little over five feet

03:31:30.704 --> 03:31:35.017
out of the portal, whipping out through towards you.

03:31:36.884 --> 03:31:38.546
That's going to be a 25 to hit.

03:31:38.546 --> 03:31:39.984
(groaning)

03:31:39.984 --> 03:31:42.914
You take-- that's actually a pretty low roll.

03:31:42.914 --> 03:31:44.064
LIAM: She's a tank, she's a tank.

03:31:44.064 --> 03:31:46.116
MATT: 20 points of bludgeoning damage.
MARISHA: It's that's grapple.

03:31:46.116 --> 03:31:47.364
MATT: And two points of acid damage.

03:31:47.364 --> 03:31:48.838
I need you to make a strength saving throw.

03:31:48.838 --> 03:31:49.671
TALIESIN: With a d4.

03:31:49.671 --> 03:31:50.804
MARISHA: Roll high.
LIAM: Come on, stronk girl.

03:31:50.804 --> 03:31:52.064
MARISHA: Yeah, that's right, you got that Bless.

03:31:52.064 --> 03:31:54.189
ASHLEY: Are we close at all, to try to--

03:31:54.189 --> 03:31:55.022
LIAM: Stronk!

03:31:57.304 --> 03:31:59.501
LIAM: No.
ASHLEY: No. No, no.

03:31:59.501 --> 03:32:00.422
MARISHA: You lie!

03:32:00.422 --> 03:32:02.604
LAURA: Seven plus two is a nine!

03:32:02.604 --> 03:32:05.621
MATT: You guys, as Jester rushes out, going towards you,

03:32:06.654 --> 03:32:09.144
she's now held and tethered through the portal.

03:32:09.144 --> 03:32:10.797
SAM: I use my Mage Hand to pull!

03:32:12.564 --> 03:32:15.341
ASHLEY: Wait, isn't your Mage Hand on the lever?

03:32:15.341 --> 03:32:17.009
MATT: Okay. Okay.

03:32:17.009 --> 03:32:18.384
ASHLEY: Isn't your Mage Hand on the lever?

03:32:18.384 --> 03:32:21.044
MATT: Mage Hand is on the lever.
SAM: It is on the lever.

03:32:21.044 --> 03:32:23.704
ASHLEY: Oh, cut that tentacle!
MATT: So we come back, Veth, it's your turn.

03:32:23.704 --> 03:32:26.972
SAM: I will push down the lever!
MARISHA: Pull the lever!

03:32:26.972 --> 03:32:28.824
LIAM: She's on the Astral Plane side?

03:32:28.824 --> 03:32:31.044
MATT: Yeah. So.

03:32:31.044 --> 03:32:32.964
MARISHA: Because it doesn't pull, it just grapples.

03:32:32.964 --> 03:32:35.592
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Correct, so she's just held there.

03:32:35.592 --> 03:32:39.144
You watch as Jester's now pulled, and being pulled,

03:32:39.144 --> 03:32:43.408
drawn back into the portal, and the portal vanishes.

03:32:43.408 --> 03:32:47.366
(cheering)

03:32:47.366 --> 03:32:52.366
With just a (splash) of water
that drifts out, releasing you.

03:32:52.403 --> 03:32:55.864
TALIESIN: In the endless void!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:32:55.864 --> 03:32:59.499
LAURA: Good job, tiny Veth!
SAM: (high-pitched) Yay!

03:32:59.499 --> 03:33:02.390
TRAVIS: It's out here you guys! (impacts)

03:33:02.390 --> 03:33:03.717
TALIESIN: Papule, running through the--

03:33:05.234 --> 03:33:06.217
LIAM: You guys.

03:33:07.272 --> 03:33:09.542
(bleats)

03:33:09.542 --> 03:33:12.694
LAURA: Do you think we could
have a feast out here in the sea?

03:33:12.694 --> 03:33:14.789
ASHLEY: Boy, I sure hope so.
TALIESIN: Very "Alice in Wonderland", trying to to set up--

03:33:14.789 --> 03:33:17.954
TRAVIS: When the door closes, what is in its place?

03:33:17.954 --> 03:33:19.045
Just a door?

03:33:19.045 --> 03:33:19.878
MATT: Nothing.

03:33:19.878 --> 03:33:21.054
TRAVIS: Nothing.
LAURA: Just emptiness.

03:33:21.054 --> 03:33:25.224
MATT: Where it vanishes, you all now glance about.

03:33:25.224 --> 03:33:29.374
The wash of elation of your escape and that victory

03:33:29.374 --> 03:33:32.409
is short-lived as you all now look about yourselves,

03:33:32.409 --> 03:33:35.224
free-floating in the middle of a spatial expanse

03:33:35.224 --> 03:33:36.727
where you've been once before.

03:33:38.314 --> 03:33:40.554
Adjacent to the Folding Halls of Halas,

03:33:40.554 --> 03:33:43.714
you once engaged and stepped into the mouth

03:33:43.714 --> 03:33:46.554
of an astral dreadnought in a very similar realm.

03:33:46.554 --> 03:33:49.324
As you now find yourselves free floating

03:33:49.324 --> 03:33:52.594
through the Astral Sea. You take stock of everyone,

03:33:52.594 --> 03:33:55.848
including the sheep, and look back.

03:33:55.848 --> 03:33:59.144
SAM: "Take stock."
TRAVIS: Just floating around.

03:33:59.144 --> 03:34:03.734
MATT: Towards the mass of rock

03:34:04.754 --> 03:34:06.137
that now--

03:34:06.137 --> 03:34:09.128
It is challenging to figure out
perspective of how big it is,

03:34:09.128 --> 03:34:11.354
it is so immense before you below:

03:34:11.354 --> 03:34:15.877
an entire still-intact section of Aeor stares back,

03:34:16.814 --> 03:34:19.364
hundreds of structures and neighborhoods and streets

03:34:19.364 --> 03:34:23.764
intertwined, arches, walkways,

03:34:23.764 --> 03:34:28.064
tall, tall towers that seem to reach on forever.

03:34:29.714 --> 03:34:34.714
Somewhere in there is Lucien and Cree,

03:34:34.844 --> 03:34:36.894
heading towards whatever their goals are.

03:34:41.064 --> 03:34:44.277
And as you all look forward to where you're intended to go,

03:34:46.255 --> 03:34:48.204
you can't help but look out of the peripheral of your eyes

03:34:48.204 --> 03:34:53.204
and see bits of the city shift and flex,

03:34:54.144 --> 03:34:57.687
like muscles involuntarily awakening,

03:34:59.114 --> 03:35:02.564
and beneath the rock you can see these long tendrils,

03:35:02.564 --> 03:35:07.084
thin, sinew-like, like drifting threads

03:35:08.024 --> 03:35:09.174
that coast along with it

03:35:09.174 --> 03:35:11.137
as it moves forward, and it is moving,

03:35:12.244 --> 03:35:14.787
closer and closer.

03:35:18.204 --> 03:35:19.047
Caleb and Beau,

03:35:20.854 --> 03:35:22.524
it's at this point that you begin to hear

03:35:22.524 --> 03:35:25.457
in the inside of your head a familiar sound,

03:35:27.034 --> 03:35:28.325
a static

03:35:29.707 --> 03:35:32.544
of faint screams and laughs

03:35:33.494 --> 03:35:36.317
and sobs and shouts,

03:35:38.314 --> 03:35:39.614
and a voice peeks through.

03:35:40.675 --> 03:35:42.083
"Welcome.

03:35:43.011 --> 03:35:46.870
"Welcome," "Welcome," "Welcome," "Welcome."

03:35:48.033 --> 03:35:49.891
"Welcome."

03:35:52.328 --> 03:35:53.354
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

03:35:53.354 --> 03:35:56.447
TRAVIS: Oh boy, they just got themselves a sheep.

03:35:57.404 --> 03:35:59.208
LIAM: Everybody flock together.

03:35:59.208 --> 03:36:01.206
(laughter)

03:36:01.206 --> 03:36:04.330
TRAVIS: We are wool-fully unprepared for this.

03:36:04.330 --> 03:36:07.674
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm bleating out of all the places.

03:36:07.674 --> 03:36:09.464
TALIESIN: The shear horror of it.

03:36:09.464 --> 03:36:11.314
ASHLEY: We're looking rough.
LAURA: Terrible.

03:36:11.314 --> 03:36:12.997
TRAVIS: What's your HP?
TALIESIN: I wanted one.

03:36:12.997 --> 03:36:13.830
That's all I needed.
ASHLEY: My total?

03:36:13.830 --> 03:36:14.855
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:36:14.855 --> 03:36:16.670
ASHLEY: 154.
TRAVIS: No, where are you now?

03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:17.855
ASHLEY: 16.

03:36:17.855 --> 03:36:19.682
(laughter)

03:36:19.682 --> 03:36:20.515
That's why-- Because I was like,

03:36:20.515 --> 03:36:22.784
I don't want any of you guys
to have to peel me off the ground,

03:36:22.784 --> 03:36:24.945
so I was like, I'm going to go through the portal.
LIAM: That's why I did what I did.

03:36:24.945 --> 03:36:28.551
I was like, I could go out of here cool and dead, or alive.

03:36:28.551 --> 03:36:31.274
TRAVIS: You did go out cool. (laughs)

03:36:31.274 --> 03:36:32.107
MATT: It was pretty cool.

03:36:32.107 --> 03:36:33.962
LIAM: This thing is holding me and I have no strength.

03:36:33.962 --> 03:36:35.054
TRAVIS: Fuck.
MATT: Oh man.

03:36:35.054 --> 03:36:35.994
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:36:35.994 --> 03:36:36.827
SAM: Cool.

03:36:36.827 --> 03:36:40.214
MATT: Well, you've made it to Cognouza.

03:36:40.214 --> 03:36:41.994
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:36:41.994 --> 03:36:44.794
MATT: We'll see what lies in store for you next time.

03:36:44.794 --> 03:36:46.294
TALIESIN: I can't wait to go shopping.

03:36:47.474 --> 03:36:48.584
SAM: Shopping episode?

03:36:48.584 --> 03:36:50.504
TALIESIN: Shopping episode, shopping episode.

03:36:50.504 --> 03:36:52.468
MARISHA: Yes.
ASHLEY: Shop-nouza?

03:36:52.468 --> 03:36:53.658
MARISHA: Shop-nouza!

03:36:53.658 --> 03:36:58.281
TALIESIN: Do you have any healing potions? (retches)

03:36:58.281 --> 03:37:00.214
MATT: Just vomits into a glass.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:37:00.214 --> 03:37:02.429
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.
LIAM: We need a shearing episode.

03:37:02.429 --> 03:37:05.037
(laughter)

03:37:05.037 --> 03:37:07.194
MATT: Well, we'll pick up there next time.

03:37:07.194 --> 03:37:09.744
Thank you all so much for joining us.

03:37:09.744 --> 03:37:12.852
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

03:37:12.852 --> 03:37:13.994
Good night.
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

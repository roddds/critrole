00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.860
MATT: Hello, everybody, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.080
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.140
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.255
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.172
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.530
MATT: So yes, before we jump into tonight's session,

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.830
we have some announcements to get through,

8
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.030
so hang tight for just a second,

9
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.460
while we go into our first

10
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.030
of two sponsorships for the night.

11
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.240
Our first, our friends at Hero Forge.

12
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.073
Sam.

13
00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:23.360
MARISHA: ♪ Hero Forge ♪
SAM: Hero Forge?

14
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.510
Tonight's episode brought to you

15
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.550
by our friends at Hero Forge,

16
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.250
makers of on-demand miniatures of all types.

17
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.410
I've used it, and it is sweet.

18
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.480
But now, it's now even sweeter,

19
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.870
because of their newly updated online platform,

20
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.510
Hero Forge 2.0, where you can still customize and print

21
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.250
your 3D minis, but for the first time,

22
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.780
you can also do it in color.

23
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.655
Yes, you can now design and color your personal minis

24
00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.220
with a variety of colors and techniques,

25
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.040
including dry brushing, washing and more.

26
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.430
They just launched the update this week.

27
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.980
So be one of the first to get a 3D custom colored mini,

28
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.070
at heroforge.com/Kickstarter.

29
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.860
Now, as I said, this new update makes their platform

30
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.520
even sweeter, and it got me thinking,

31
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.350
everything is better when it's sweeter, right?

32
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.050
Well, thanks to Hero Forge, come bring it out, boys,

33
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.300
I'm going to put that theory to the test.

34
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.470
I've taken common food items, and with,

35
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.460
that we all know and love--

36
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.263
TALIESIN: No.
MARISHA: This is going to be gross.

37
00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:22.813
SAM: And I'm going to test if making them sweeter

38
00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:25.129
makes them better.

39
00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:26.550
So we'll start

40
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.310
with the common chili dog.

41
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.976
TRAVIS: What?
TALIESIN: Nope.

42
00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:31.683
SAM: Adding a little

43
00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:34.570
whipped cream to it.
ASHLEY: What's already on it?

44
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.960
SAM: Yep, and let's see.

45
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.693
LAURA: Nope.
SAM: If it makes it better.

46
00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:38.904
TALIESIN: May I use this as a shield?

47
00:01:38.904 --> 00:01:43.290
LAURA: No, wait, hold that down.

48
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.308
SAM: It's better.

49
00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:45.900
TRAVIS: No way.
SAM: That is better.

50
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.740
TRAVIS: You're such a foodie, how are you even doing this?

51
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.060
LAURA: Yeah, get that-- do not put that near me.

52
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.657
MARISHA: Don't, just ugh.

53
00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:55.913
SAM: Let's try a salad.
TRAVIS: No!

54
00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:57.080
SAM: This is your standard Caesar.

55
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.140
LAURA: That looks better than the chili dog.

56
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.214
SAM: Let's see what a salad tastes like with whipped cream.

57
00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:05.630
TALIESIN: Help!
ASHLEY: That might not be as bad.

58
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.630
LAURA: That one's not bad.
ASHLEY: That one's not--

59
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.620
TALIESIN: If there's vinegar in there, it's going to curdle.

60
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.161
It's going to curdle.
SAM: It's better.

61
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.732
(laughter)

62
00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.790
Oh! There's a sound effect.

63
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.282
LIAM: We'll miss you, Hero Forge, we'll miss you.

64
00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:20.980
SAM: Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

65
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.240
ASHLEY: Whoa, hey, ho, hey, hold on, hold on.

66
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.805
Give me some before you ruin them.

67
00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:25.750
SAM: Sure.

68
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.950
ASHLEY: Because I love Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

69
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.640
SAM: Are they better sweeter?

70
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.506
Let's find out.

71
00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:33.040
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm all right with this,
I'm all right with this.

72
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.873
MARISHA: It's like a--

73
00:02:33.873 --> 00:02:35.550
ASHLEY: I feel like it's going to be good.

74
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.807
LAURA: Why you do you have to
make such a mess about it, Sam?

75
00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:40.460
MARISHA: It's spicy.
TRAVIS: -- shit through the back of your chair.

76
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.293
LAURA: How is it?
TRAVIS: It's going to be

77
00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.070
a river of magma.
SAM: It's better.

78
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.985
TRAVIS: No!
DANI (V.O.): Better.

79
00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:47.877
ASHLEY: How is it?
LAURA: It's not bad.

80
00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:50.750
SAM: There's two more.
LAURA: It's really not bad.

81
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.393
SAM: There's two more, two more.
LAURA: No.

82
00:02:52.393 --> 00:02:54.037
SAM: Pepperoni pizza.
LAURA: Nope.

83
00:02:54.037 --> 00:02:56.373
MATT: Aw, that one's been sitting out for a while.

84
00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:57.910
LIAM: You going to fold that shit, fold that.

85
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.640
LAURA: No, no, be careful with the table.

86
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.194
SAM: Mm.
TRAVIS: (groaning)

87
00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:03.750
ASHLEY: It's all over your--
TRAVIS: Oh god.

88
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.087
TALIESIN: Oh, yep, no, it's on the, no.

89
00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:07.620
SAM: Not as good.
TRAVIS: Okay.

90
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.828
DANI (V.O.): Worse.

91
00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:10.784
(laughter)

92
00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:12.515
SAM: But last but not least--
TRAVIS: You're not.

93
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:14.109
MATT: Oh no.

94
00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.100
SAM: Fine wine.

95
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.471
LAURA: No!

96
00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:20.182
(yelling)

97
00:03:20.182 --> 00:03:22.570
MARISHA: It instantly curdled.

98
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.420
TRAVIS: Don't, no, don't, no!

99
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.470
ASHLEY: It's dessert.

100
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.690
TALIESIN: Go for it, go for it!

101
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.523
MARISHA: Ooh, did you see that?

102
00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:28.960
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, I did, I did.

103
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.793
SAM: Worse.

104
00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.610
(laughter)
DANI (V.O.): Worse.

105
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.754
SAM: Wait, let me try it again.

106
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.632
(yelling)

107
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.757
SAM: Worse.

108
00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:37.590
DANI (V.O.): Worse.

109
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.600
SAM: Oh, that was good.

110
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.990
Maybe I should brush my teeth a little.

111
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.170
MATT: (shouting) No, no, no!

112
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.322
SAM: You know, just clean off the old teeth.

113
00:03:45.322 --> 00:03:47.490
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

114
00:03:49.332 --> 00:03:51.174
MATT: I'm pretty sure all this is against TOS.

115
00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:53.922
SAM: Worse.

116
00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:55.565
DANI (V.O.): Worse.
SAM: Oh, wait.

117
00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:56.706
Better.

118
00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:58.167
DANI (V.O.): Better.

119
00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:00.800
SAM: Well, I think I've proven a point, guys.

120
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.350
Making things sweeter makes it better.

121
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.110
So go check out the sweet new update

122
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.713
at heroforge.com/Kickstarter and thanks to Hero Forge

123
00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:09.775
for supporting the show.

124
00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:11.257
TRAVIS: Don't!
(yelling)

125
00:04:11.257 --> 00:04:14.829
No, stop it!
(laughter)

126
00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.131
TALIESIN: No.

127
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:20.453
TRAVIS: You looked like you walked under a street lamp.

128
00:04:20.453 --> 00:04:21.903
SAM: Back to you, Matt.

129
00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:28.241
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: No, no, no, why?

130
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.575
(laughter)

131
00:04:33.692 --> 00:04:37.212
TRAVIS: Do you have antacids on standby?

132
00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:38.220
SAM: I'll just brush my teeth again.

133
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.080
LAURA: I'm so glad that I moved further away.

134
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.060
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

135
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.220
MARISHA: That got me a little in the back of my throat.

136
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.853
MATT: Thank you so much. And thank you, Hero Forge,

137

138
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:53.578
I'm sure none of us could have expected--

139
00:04:53.578 --> 00:04:54.642
MARISHA: Do it.

140
00:04:54.642 --> 00:04:56.757
LAURA: No, it's good, it's good.

141
00:04:56.757 --> 00:04:58.298
ASHLEY: (crunching)

142
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.031
Oh, that is actually really good.

143
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:01.260
MARISHA: Yeah, that makes the most sense.

144
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.862
ASHLEY: That makes the most sense to me.

145
00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:04.908
The wine one did, but--
TRAVIS: Get at us Frito Lay, we'll--

146
00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:06.633
MATT: All right, moving on.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:07.470
MATT: To our--

148
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.860

and colors by Stephan McGowan.

174
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.321
You can pick up your own
issue for Free Comic Book Day

175
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:14.930
at your local comic book
shop on Free Comic Book Day.

176
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.380
It's May 2nd, so keep
an eye on your calendars

177
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.700
now for it, it's exciting,

178
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.620
because it's a fun,
little stand alone piece.

179
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.670
Even if you haven't read
any of Vox Machina: Origins,

180
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.440
it sits a little bit outside

181
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.550
of the realm of the first campaign,

182
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.010
and it's got some cool perspective.

183
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.590
And we get to share a
cover with the name Neil Gaiman,

184
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.200
who has content in there, as well,

185
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.207
and that's kind of cool.

186
00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:34.907
TRAVIS: Sure.
MATT: Hi, Neil.

187
00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:37.280
ASHLEY: "Has content in there as well."
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

188
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.610
MATT: Well, it's weird, because it's like us,

189
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.820
and it's like, also Neil Gaiman.

190
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.460
I'm like, this should be
the other way around, but okay.

191
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.822
But yeah, check it out.

192
00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:45.840
I think that's it for me, and Marisha,

193
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.020
you have an announcement.

194
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.460
MARISHA: I do.

195
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.280
Speaking of Sam's ridiculous antics,

196
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.371
and also Liam,

197
00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:57.746
All Work, No Play is coming back!

198
00:06:57.746 --> 00:06:58.928
SAM: What?!

199
00:06:58.928 --> 00:07:00.220
LIAM: No, surely not, no!

200
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.622
MARISHA: I know.

201
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:04.030
Just-- you know, we had to
keep up with the tradition

202
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.890
of the podcast and make
it take forever for Season 2.

203
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.745
LIAM: We recorded a minute a week.

204
00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:12.830
TRAVIS: Did you drink the entire time?

205
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.400
MARISHA: Oh, yes, everyone continues
to have its signature cocktail

206
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.480
attached to it, but it is premiering

207
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.230
not this next Tuesday,
but the Tuesday after,

208
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.949
February 4th.
TRAVIS: Woo!

209
00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.130
MARISHA: At 4:00pm on our Twitch channel

210
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.520
for our Season 2 premiere.

211
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.320
We are airing the show
a little bit differently.

212
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.440
Instead of a Friday night
show, we're going to put it

213
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.690
in the Yee-Haw Game Ranch time slot.

214
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.656
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

215
00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:40.550
MARISHA: And it's going to air
biweekly for the entire season.

216
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.480
SAM: We're very excited about it.

217
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.140
Yep, we did some fun stuff.
MARISHA: It's hilarious.

218
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.140
There are some references
to times of the year.

219
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.194
SAM: When we shot it?
MARISHA: When we shot it.

220
00:07:52.194 --> 00:07:53.027
(laughter)

221
00:07:53.027 --> 00:07:56.153
LIAM: You will be shocked
at how long ago we started this season.

222
00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:59.344
MARISHA: Yes.
(laughter)

223
00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:01.170
It took a bit, but yes.

224
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.120
It's worth the wait.

225
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.242
TRAVIS: Old President Obama.
MARISHA: Yeah.

226
00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:07.990
(laughter)

227
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.220
MATT: The Force Awakens is coming up.

228
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.750
MARISHA: That's more accurate.

229
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.306
Yeah, there's like shit like that in it.

230
00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:16.590
Like, oh, wait, what?

231
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.030
Okay.

232
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.375
Yeah, it's great.

233
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.590
It's worth the wait, tune in.

234
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.020
MATT: There we go.
MARISHA: Content.

235
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.570
TRAVIS: Finger guns.
MARISHA: Pew, pew.

236
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.783
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Pew, pew, pew.

237
00:08:27.783 --> 00:08:29.250
MATT: Thank you, Marisha.
MARISHA: Yeah.

238
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.047
MATT: Laura, you have some
announcements as well.

239
00:08:31.047 --> 00:08:32.570
LAURA: Oh me?

240
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.700
MATT: You.
LAURA: Oh, well,

241
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.450
you guys may have noticed, I'm wearing this

242
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.805
fantabulous Traveler Con--
(yelling)

243
00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:42.849
What what!

244
00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:44.140
MARISHA: It's so cute.

245
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.680
LAURA: That's available in our stores right now.

246
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.078
MARISHA: You too can join the cult.

247
00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:52.380
LAURA: Were they handmade by Jester?

248
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.213
Possibly.

249
00:08:53.213 --> 00:08:56.110
TRAVIS: What's on the--
what's on the cuff there?

250
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.598
SAM: Oh, is that a secret?

251
00:08:57.598 --> 00:08:59.174
LAURA: Why you gotta
call it out like that?

252
00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:01.087
SAM: Let me see it.
TRAVIS: I just saw it. I don't know.

253
00:09:01.087 --> 00:09:01.920
SAM: Don't show them.

254
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.590
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

255
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.420
ASHLEY: Oh, that's cool.
LAURA: It's cute, right?

256
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.250
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: Ooh, there's an Easter egg.

257
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.720
LAURA: So anyway.
ASHLEY: You're supposed

258
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.830
to wear it this way, right?

259
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.355
LAURA: Yeah.
(laughter)

260
00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:13.360
TRAVIS: Are all the cultists ordering?
LAURA: So yeah, check them out,

261
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.660
they're in both our U.S. and UK shops.

262
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.271
And then, other thing that I wanted to mention

263
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:23.271
is on Saturday, I will be joining
the Pull Your Finger Out,

264
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.290
what finger, where it was, I don't know,

265
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.710
but I'll be joining the
Pull Your Finger Out

266
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.893
charity stream--

267
00:09:27.893 --> 00:09:30.840
MATT: That's a long name
for a charity stream.

268
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.398
TALIESIN: Is it better if it's sweeter
is really my question.

269
00:09:33.398 --> 00:09:35.998
(laughter)
LAURA: Oh, no.

270
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:39.230
It's a charity stream put
together by my very good friend,

271
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.310
Liam McIntyre to benefit those affected

272
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.623
by the Australian bush fires.

273
00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:47.420
So that's going on from 11:00 to 5:00 on Saturday.

274
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.150
Our good friends at
Retro Replay are hosting it,

275
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.640
so check it out on
youtube.com/c/RetroReplay.

276
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.400
I'll be joining around 3:00pm,

277
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.110
if you want to come show the critter love,

278
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.639
I would appreciate it.
ASHLEY: Give it a critter a hug!

279
00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:01.540
LAURA: That's right.
LIAM: Critter hug!

280
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.330
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

281
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.560
All right, then, I believe that concludes

282
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.938
our announcements for the evening.

283
00:10:07.938 --> 00:10:12.137
So let's go ahead and jump

MATT: And welcome back.

322
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.719
Oh, happy to have you join us, Sam.

323
00:11:56.719 --> 00:11:59.255
SAM: Just brushed my teeth again.
MATT: (laughs)

324
00:11:59.255 --> 00:12:01.096
Is that how you keep them so large?

325
00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:03.331
(laughter)

326
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:05.602
SAM: Wow.
TRAVIS: DM burn!

327
00:12:05.602 --> 00:12:07.606
Oh shit, we're in trouble.

328
00:12:07.606 --> 00:12:09.475
SAM: Burn.
TALIESIN: Mercer family hot sauce.

329
00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:11.427
TRAVIS: Two beholders and a fucking tarrasque--

330
00:12:11.427 --> 00:12:14.849
LIAM: Put a goatee on that man.
That is evil twin Matthew Mercer.

331
00:12:14.849 --> 00:12:16.044
(laughter)

332
00:12:16.044 --> 00:12:17.419
MATT: I get one every century.

333
00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:19.843
TALIESIN: That's the most shade
I've ever seen you throw.

334
00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:23.258
Holy shit.
ASHLEY: We should be nervous.

335
00:12:23.258 --> 00:12:25.723
TRAVIS: He's stunned, ladies and
gentlemen, he's on the ropes.

336
00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:27.131
MARISHA: I'm so proud!

337
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:29.464
ASHLEY: I know, it's like,
"I might kill you all."

338
00:12:29.464 --> 00:12:30.778
MATT: So.

339
00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:33.861
(laughter)

340
00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:38.861
Last we left off, The Mighty Nein had brokered

341
00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:41.777
a coming negotiation between the warring nations

342
00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:44.826
of the Dwendalian Empire in the Kryn Dynasty.

343
00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.009
Set to occur somewhere in the Lucidian Ocean

344
00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:50.174
between Nicodranas and the Whitedawn Lagoon,

345
00:12:50.174 --> 00:12:53.932
about four, roughly four weeks out,

346
00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:56.120
I think is when they had confirmed it.

347
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.029
You also heard that they
had acquired and arrested Vence,

348
00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:03.873
the fugitive who was part
of the Angel of Irons cult.

349
00:13:03.873 --> 00:13:06.788
And in the interim, you made
your way back to Xhorhas.

350
00:13:06.788 --> 00:13:11.788
You made it to your home, the Xhorhaus,

351
00:13:13.087 --> 00:13:15.599
and had an evening to rest
after an extended period

352
00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:18.970
of extreme duress and stress,

353
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.865
the recovery of your friend Yasha,

354
00:13:21.865 --> 00:13:25.685
some underground pit fighting,

355
00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:28.285
and a dinner with Essek after an invitation--
MARISHA: Hot boi!

356
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:29.781
ASHLEY: Hot boi!
TRAVIS: Wow.

357
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:31.960
MATT: In which you got a chance

358
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.410
to know each other a little better.

359
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.530
You then, in discussing your
plans moving forward,

360
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.940
some possibilities and pursuing
some of the various goals

361
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.660
that still remain looming for a few of you,

362
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.730
you were greeted by Essek and he offered

363
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.100
at one point to help you with this strange problem

364
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.720
you were having with this equation for the spell

365
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.380
that you had been developing since discovering

366
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.670
its early sketches, essentially,

367
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.240
or the first half of its development by Halas

368
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.010
within his Happy Fun Ball, as you put it.

369
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.780
With the aid of Essek, both Nott and Caleb,

370
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.560
up in his tower, finished the
development of this spell.

371
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.670
You all rushed to gather your materials

372
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.310
that were required for its casting and watched

373
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.800
as Caleb prepared the ritual

374
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.740
to bring Nott back to her original form,

375
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.270
the body she is meant to have.

376
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.910
The ritual progressed, seemingly without issue

377
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.340
until the moment in which the transition

378
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.970
of the body was meant to happen.

379
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.580
Reaching towards it, however,

380
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.240
the magic was balked by some sort of dark power,

381
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.120
a curse that remained laid upon Nott,

382
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.060
preventing it from succeeding,

383
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.110
locking herself still to the current goblin body

384
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.800
that she's grown to loathe.

385
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.450
Well, maybe grown a little more comfortable

386
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.220
with it since then, but.

387
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.497
SAM: She sure doesn't like her teeth anymore.

388
00:15:05.497 --> 00:15:08.414
(laughter)

389
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.371
MATT: As the ritual comes to a...

390
00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:18.488
unexpected end,

391
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.870
you look as the clay element of the tub

392
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.640
that Nott had been placed upon

393
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.060
has shattered and scattered across the room,

394
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.020
the magic itself suddenly flaring out,

395
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.490
the sigil that marked the ritual going cold,

396
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.380
and all of you look down to see Nott there,

397
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.100
sitting atop the broken sections of hardened clay,

398
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.220
a goblin as she's always been since you met her.

399
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.880
LIAM: Caleb just starts checking his notes

400
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.070
and everything that they worked on together

401
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.030
to see what went wrong.

402
00:15:53.713 --> 00:15:57.120
SAM: It didn't-- it didn't work, did it?

403
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.270
LAURA: I mean, I think you're a little less green

404
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.130
than you were before.

405
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.780
SAM: Just look at my hands and stuff. Looks the same?

406
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.613
MATT: Unchanged.

407
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.624
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yes,

408
00:16:11.624 --> 00:16:13.800
look all around, see if it's all the same.

409
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.200
LAURA: I'll check the ears

410
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.997
and I'll check the back of the head to see.

411
00:16:17.997 --> 00:16:22.340
MATT: Some flecks of dry, brown
clay that had gotten wedged

412
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.020
in the elements of the hair, but beyond that,

413
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.070
no noticeable change.

414
00:16:26.137 --> 00:16:27.937
SAM: (sighs)
LAURA: You're still Nott.

415
00:16:29.314 --> 00:16:30.617
SAM: Huh.

416
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.190
I-- well, I mean, did you do it right?

417
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.840
Did he do it right?

418
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.320
MATT: Essek goes,

419
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.190
"From what I could observe of this ritual,

420
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.640
"everything was done to the
required specifications."

421
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.515
LIAM: I'm meticulous.

422
00:16:47.515 --> 00:16:48.931
SAM: Yes, you are.

423
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.305
Did you all hear that? The--

424
00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:53.200
LAURA: Hear what?

425
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.350
SAM: The woman laughing?

426
00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.200
MARISHA: Did we?
LAURA: No, we didn't--

427
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.660
MATT: Only the both of you heard it.

428
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.280
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

429
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.060
TALIESIN: No.
ASHLEY: None of us were laughing.

430
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.646
SAM: I hope not.

431
00:17:06.646 --> 00:17:08.146
LIAM: I heard it.

432
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.790
LAURA: What did it sound like?

433
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.400
SAM: It sounded distant, and evil,

434
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.610
and it sounded like--
yeah, I mean, the only person

435
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.900
I can think of is the person who did this to me,

436
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.130
this woman, this mage woman.

437
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.990
It sounded like her, maybe.

438
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.310
Maybe?

439
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.510
LAURA: Did it sound like when
I send you a message?

440
00:17:36.282 --> 00:17:38.832
SAM: I don't know that you've ever sent me a message.

441
00:17:38.832 --> 00:17:40.890
LAURA: I'm going to send
Nott a message right now.

442
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.090
MATT: Okay, what are you going to send?

443
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.114
LAURA: I'm going to say--

444
00:17:43.114 --> 00:17:44.580
this is weird being right next to you.

445
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.020
Is it going to be like
feedback on a cellphone?

446
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.000
SAM: I can hear a delay.

447
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.210
LAURA: Can you-- What does it sound like?

448
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.482
SAM: Oh, I have to leave the room.

449
00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:53.504
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Go downstairs.

450
00:17:53.504 --> 00:17:54.400
SAM: I'll leave the room.

451
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.317
Okay, go.
LAURA: Does it sound like this?

452
00:17:57.317 --> 00:17:59.652
Did it sound like the laughing?
TRAVIS: That's it.

453
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.270
SAM: Did it sound like that?

454
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.930
MATT: A different kind of sense.

455
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.920
This is a series of words

456
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.100
being placed into your mind,

457
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.550
into your very aware consciousness.

458
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.510
The laughter felt deep-seated within you.

459
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.900
SAM: Not the same.
MATT: No.

460
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.877
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's
gotta to be exactly that.

461
00:18:23.877 --> 00:18:25.118
SAM: What does that mean?

462
00:18:25.118 --> 00:18:27.610
She's watching me, she's haunting me?

463
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.516
LIAM: She still has some
sort of grasp on you, yeah?

464
00:18:30.516 --> 00:18:31.349
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

465
00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:35.500
Do you think she can hear everything you do?

466
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.110
SAM: Has she been with us this whole time?

467
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.410
Who is she?

468
00:18:40.194 --> 00:18:43.240
LAURA: Do you remember anything about her, Nott?

469
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.580
LIAM: Go over it again in your mind.

470
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.010
Tell us the story again.

471
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.290
SAM: Oh, well.

472
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.272
I'll skip some of it.

473
00:18:58.018 --> 00:19:02.736
The pertinent parts are they took me to a river,

474
00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:06.610
they drowned me, and that's all I remembered

475
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.760
for a long time, except, then, when I woke up,

476
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.135
it was to the sound of that laughter.

477
00:19:14.135 --> 00:19:17.725
It was to the sound of that woman,

478
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.702
just enjoying whatever she had done to me.

479
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.288
I was in a sort of a state of shock,

480
00:19:32.622 --> 00:19:34.350
I didn't feel like myself.

481
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.320
I wasn't sure what was going on.

482
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.165
Things sounded louder, and felt different,

483
00:19:40.215 --> 00:19:44.730
and my body was colder, and
I wasn't paying much attention

484
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.859
but she was there. She was robed,

485
00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:52.550
and she was older, and--

486
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.410
TRAVIS: You were at the river still?

487
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.285
SAM: No, they had taken
me somewhere, to her...

488
00:19:58.218 --> 00:19:59.695
home?

489
00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:01.050
LAURA: Did she seem tall--
SAM: Lair?

490
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.700
LAURA: Did she seem short?
Do you remember?

491
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.341
SAM: Taller than me.

492
00:20:04.341 --> 00:20:07.313
MARISHA: What was the surrounding landscape?

493
00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:10.499
SAM: Okay, well, it wasn't Felderwin.

494
00:20:10.499 --> 00:20:12.499
It was-- it was--

495
00:20:12.499 --> 00:20:15.880
It wasn't terribly far,

496
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.700
but I-- it was a wooded area at the base

497
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.760
or in some mountains,
a wooded, mountainous area.

498
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.490
ASHLEY: How did you get out?

499
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.957
SAM: They took me.
The goblins were still there.

500
00:20:28.957 --> 00:20:31.390
TRAVIS: And you saw yourself
leave from this lair,

501
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.850
this house at the base of the mountains?

502
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.870
SAM: Well, yes, they put me in the back of--

503
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.378
just some sort of a cart and tied
me up and brought me with them.

504
00:20:41.378 --> 00:20:42.808
LAURA: Get the map out.

505
00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.575
TRAVIS: Which one-- which--
I have so many.

506
00:20:45.575 --> 00:20:47.917
LAURA: The Empire. The Empire one.

507
00:20:47.917 --> 00:20:50.890
SAM: Well, not near, but not terribly far.

508
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.050
LIAM: Well, it should take us back to this river.

509
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.220
LAURA: Where's our Empire map?

510
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.052
SAM: The river was close to Felderwin. I--

511
00:20:56.052 --> 00:20:57.800
LAURA: No, that's Xhorhas.

512
00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.200
LIAM: Well, if they didn't take you that far,

513
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.070
there cannot be many mountains--

514
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.578
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on,
let's look at the map.

515
00:21:02.578 --> 00:21:04.483
Let's look at the map.
Where's the map, Fjord?

516
00:21:04.483 --> 00:21:05.907
LAURA: Oh, there it is,
there it is, okay.

517
00:21:05.907 --> 00:21:07.990
TRAVIS: I've been sharing them with
Yasha, okay, it's not always me.

518
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.800
MATT: It was days of travel,
once you had been--

519
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.890
once you had reawoken and
they had pulled you away,

520
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.190
but it-- you never left--

521
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:20.231
once you left the mountains you
know you were in the Marrow Valley.

522
00:21:20.231 --> 00:21:21.700
SAM: Okay.

523
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.960
LAURA: This is all Marrow Valley?

524
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.617
MATT: Yeah, the whole Marrow Valley's
the southern area of the Empire.

525
00:21:26.617 --> 00:21:29.333
LAURA: How long did it take you
to get back to your goblin--

526
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:32.650
SAM: I wasn't counting, I was mostly crying

527
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.390
and trying to tear at my bindings, and--

528
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.120
TRAVIS: Damn your emotional state.
SAM: I know.

529
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.410
A day, two, three maybe?

530
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.434
Also, we--

531
00:21:43.434 --> 00:21:46.890
we were-- we were stopping frequently.

532
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.100
They were doing raids on the way.

533
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.940
I don't know how long it would've taken

534
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.130
if we had driven straight through.

535
00:21:54.005 --> 00:21:56.030
ASHLEY: Wait, what?
TALIESIN: Mm.

536
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.910
ASHLEY: Why did they take you to the river

537
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.460
to drown you anyway?

538
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.310
Why do you think they chose you to do this?

539
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.752
SAM: Well, I had killed one of them,

540
00:22:05.752 --> 00:22:08.620
and they didn't like that very much.

541
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.932
I had killed their leader,

542
00:22:13.264 --> 00:22:17.290
and in my frantic escape,

543
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.680
I had killed their leader,
and his wife was not

544
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.890
very happy about that,
and she wanted to make

545
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.620
an example of me, or punish me in a way

546
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.187
that was much more cruel than death.

547
00:22:33.202 --> 00:22:34.820
TALIESIN: Hmm.

548
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.470
LIAM: You want to restore yourself, don't you?

549
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.090
SAM: Of course.

550
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.830
LIAM: Then we have to go there.
SAM: Why?

551
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.100
How-- what are you talking about?

552
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.460
LAURA: We have to find
this woman and kill her.

553
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.340
LIAM: To find this woman.

554
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.900
We have to approach
this village of goblins

555
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.280
you're talking about,
to find some sort of lead,

556
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.372
or go to the place of your drowning.

557
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.921
TRAVIS: Yeah, the goblins could essentially,

558
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:03.190
hopefully, take us back to her,
point us in that direction?

559
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.696
SAM: And then what? We have--
MARISHA: What was it you were just saying?

560
00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:08.000
I was distracted by looking at
the map; about some woman

561
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.310
wanting to punish you?

562
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.290
What did you do, what?

563
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.484
SAM: The goblins, they didn't just kill me,

564
00:23:12.484 --> 00:23:15.880
because I had-- I had killed one of their own,

565
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.540
their chief or whatever,

566
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.340
and his wife was not very pleased,

567
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.670
and so, she--
MARISHA: A goblin wife.

568
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.450
TRAVIS: And so that Beau can be reminded

569
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.150
of things that we've already heard,

570
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.690
and you killed their chief because why?

571
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.000
SAM: I was escaping, I was trying to escape--

572
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.367
TRAVIS: She was trying to escape.
SAM: Yes.

573
00:23:34.367 --> 00:23:37.150
ASHLEY: Why were you captured in the first place?

574
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.680
SAM: They had captured many
of us from the village,

575
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.650
including my husband and my baby,

576
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.650
and we escaped one night.

577
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:51.650
I had them, we split off,
because I was faster,

578
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.940
and I drew--
LAURA: See?

579
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.100
SAM: Well, faster than Yeza, I mean, he's--

580
00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.180
he's a bit of a nerd, you know?

581
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.062
LAURA: So? Nerds can be fast.
SAM: Nope, they can't.

582
00:24:02.062 --> 00:24:03.354
They cannot be.

583
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:11.320
So we split up, they got away,
but I was captured,

584
00:24:12.853 --> 00:24:14.777
and in my struggle, I...

585
00:24:16.144 --> 00:24:18.503
I got in a good shot.

586
00:24:18.503 --> 00:24:19.653
TRAVIS: Sounds like it.

587
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.480
Caleb's right, we should try
and find these goblins again.

588
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.146
I know how terrible that must be,

589
00:24:25.146 --> 00:24:27.204
but that would be the fastest way to--

590
00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.170
SAM: To do what, though?

591
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.690
I mean, find this woman, and what?

592
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.710
Tell her to undo what she has done?

593
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.268
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Although I--

594
00:24:34.268 --> 00:24:35.318
SAM: What if I kill--

595
00:24:35.318 --> 00:24:37.440
what if we kill her,
and it doesn't wear off?

596
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.550
What if it's permanent?

597
00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.008
LIAM: Well, then we will coerce her. We will--

598
00:24:41.008 --> 00:24:42.024
TRAVIS: Of course, yeah.

599
00:24:42.024 --> 00:24:45.474
LAURA: Wait, maybe we can try a
Greater Restoration sort of thing

600
00:24:45.474 --> 00:24:47.410
and break a curse. Does that work?

601
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.872
MARISHA: What would we know
about this big curse?

602
00:24:50.872 --> 00:24:52.556
Does it sound like a curse?

603
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.140
MATT: You can go ahead and make a religion check.

604
00:24:58.317 --> 00:25:00.440
TRAVIS: Anything that has a residual laugh on it,

605
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.932
it sure sounds like it.

606
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.390
LIAM: 17.

607
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.310
MATT: 17.

608
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.810
The nature of what
prevented you from breaking

609
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.740
through this spell wasn't any sort

610
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.340
of abjuration-based defense.

611
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.380
It wasn't any sort of arcane deflection.

612
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.271
This was something outside of the spectrum

613
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:24.130
of general arcane development.

614
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.000
This was something older
and something with a little more

615
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
of a divine or outside magical force

616
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.983
than what you're used to dealing with,

617
00:25:33.983 --> 00:25:35.460
and the best thing you can attribute it to

618
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.660
with your experience is a curse or something

619
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.850
that is laid deeply within
that could resist a spell

620
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.987
such as what you were attempting.

621
00:25:43.987 --> 00:25:45.630
TALIESIN: It has its own rules.

622
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.840
LIAM: Yeah, which we have encountered curses

623
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.340
to an extent before?

624
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.773
MATT: Lesser ones.
LIAM: Yeah, lesser ones.

625
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.030
SAM: And there's no-- the only way to break it

626
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.760
is to find the caster, is that right?

627
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.020
LIAM: We don't know, but what is the other--

628
00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.420
LAURA: Dispel Magic!
LIAM: What is the alternative?

629
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.480
TRAVIS: Whoa.
SAM: Did it work?

630
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.313
LAURA: I don't know.

631
00:26:14.313 --> 00:26:15.598
MATT: What level did you cast it at?

632
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.614
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're throwing spaghetti at the wall.
LAURA: Sixth.

633
00:26:18.614 --> 00:26:19.448
MATT: Okay.

634
00:26:19.448 --> 00:26:20.306
SAM: Jesus.
MARISHA: Whoa.

635
00:26:20.306 --> 00:26:22.240
MATT: You cast Dispel Magic on Nott?

636
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.620
LAURA: Yeah.

637
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.465
At 6th-level.
MATT: Okay.

638
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.812
LAURA: Well, maybe it worked?

639
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.273
TRAVIS: Do you feel any different?

640
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.170
TALIESIN: You don't look any different.

641
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.650
TRAVIS: Do you have chills?

642
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.434
Are they multiplyin'?
(laughter)

643
00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:44.288
♪ Are you losing control? ♪

644
00:26:44.288 --> 00:26:45.439
MATT: I'm going to remember that.

645
00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:47.872
TRAVIS: Okay.
(laughter)

646
00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:48.997
MARISHA: He invoked Grease.

647
00:26:48.997 --> 00:26:51.410
SAM: I feel the same.
MATT: I hate Grease.

648
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.110
LIAM: Fjord would.
MARISHA: Fjord would.

649
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.060
MARISHA: So the woman that you
can remember turning you

650
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.440
into this form wasn't a goblin?

651
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.070
It was someone else?
SAM: No.

652
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.670
No, was she-- she was a human?
She was a humanoid?

653
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.800
MATT: From what I remember, humanoid.

654
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.258
Older, robed.

655
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.650
You were looking up at her, so it's hard

656
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.760
to remember the details,
and you only caught a glimpse

657
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.460
of her in the surroundings,
but she definitely seemed

658
00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.210
to be like an older humanoid,
human-type face,

659
00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.670
but definitely deep-set lines.

660
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.260
You can hear the brief
instance of the laughter

661
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.260
and then, the only words you
recall her saying dealt with...

662
00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.300
"A debt has been paid."

663
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.250
SAM: Okay.

664
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.820
I convey that to them.

665
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.440
LAURA: A debt has been paid, like
the goblins owed her a debt?

666
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.720
Or no, she owed the goblins a debt.
SAM: She must've owed them a debt.

667
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.445
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, that is what it sounds like.

668
00:27:51.445 --> 00:27:55.136
This goblin wife settled up

669
00:27:55.136 --> 00:27:57.794
with whoever this woman was,

670
00:27:57.794 --> 00:28:00.485
and an exchange was made, and...

671
00:28:01.452 --> 00:28:03.885
she must be close

672
00:28:03.885 --> 00:28:06.900
to that place, and otherwise,
you will just have

673
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.790
to throw up your hands and
accept that it's the only option.

674
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.839
SAM: Of course, but I mean,
we would have to go

675
00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:17.980
and find the goblins who did this first,

676
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.370
and there's many of them,
and they move a lot.

677
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.690
MARISHA: I've got cottonmouth.

678
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.550
Does anybody want anything to drink?

679
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.880
Are we still in the-- where are we?

680
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.330
MATT: You're still in Essek's tower.

681
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.930
MARISHA: We should go, why don't we go?

682
00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.190
Why don't we go back home?

683
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.450
SAM: Go back to the Xhorhaus?

684
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.960
MARISHA: God, I'm itchy.
TRAVIS: What is wrong?

685
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.076
SAM: Are you okay?
LAURA: Itchy?

686
00:28:38.076 --> 00:28:40.320
MARISHA: I'm just sweaty all of a sudden.

687
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.157
Let's go back to the--
LIAM: You feeling sick?

688
00:28:43.157 --> 00:28:45.490
MARISHA: A little.
LIAM: Yeah. We should get you back, then.

689
00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.581
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: And we can pick this up there.

690
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.120
She does this, it's an extreme case of syphilis

691
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.950
that surfaces once in a while, so you know,

692
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.320
she takes some STD--
SAM: It's in remission.

693
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.536
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: "All right."

694
00:28:57.536 --> 00:28:59.760
MARISHA: Try to keep it under wraps,
but thanks, Caleb.

695
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.080
LIAM: Oh, well, we are friends.

696
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:01.913
MARISHA: We are.

697
00:29:01.913 --> 00:29:04.173
We are good friends, aren't we, Essek?

698
00:29:04.173 --> 00:29:05.215
MATT: "Apparently.

699
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.567
"My apologies that this did
not work in your favor."

700
00:29:09.567 --> 00:29:12.420
SAM: No, thank you for
helping us get this far.

701
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.660
TALIESIN: Thank you for everything.

702
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.493
LAURA: Yeah.

703
00:29:14.493 --> 00:29:16.150
MATT: "I hope the cheese was all right."

704
00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.470
LAURA: It was delicious.

705
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.930
Your pastries could use some work,

706
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.580
but the cheese was delicious.

707
00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.730
MATT: "I accept the criticism."

708
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.897
TALIESIN: It's all right if I
take a little of the cheese--

709
00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.060
MATT: "I will punish the bakery."

710
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.380
SAM: So sorry for--
LAURA: Don't punish, Essek.

711
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.200
Just order better things next time.

712
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.874
MATT: "I was attempting a joke."
LAURA: Oh.

713
00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:37.040
MARISHA: (laughs)

714
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.856
SAM: Sorry for--
MATT: You see a crack of a smile.

715
00:29:38.856 --> 00:29:41.373
SAM: -- digging up your garden back there, too.

716
00:29:41.373 --> 00:29:43.690
MATT: "Eh, it is fine. Easy to fix.

717
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.520
"Anyway."

718
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.642
MARISHA: Sorry to dash like this.

719
00:29:51.642 --> 00:29:52.833
MATT: "Of course."

720
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:57.190
ASHLEY: We could also help you one day
to put together your garden again.

721
00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.190
MATT: "I can have some
servants take care of that."

722
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.165
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: We will see you soon.

723
00:30:03.165 --> 00:30:06.606
She snaps back like that.
She's like that.

724
00:30:06.606 --> 00:30:08.064
MATT: "Wonderful."

725
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:14.060
He gestures for you to make your exit.

726
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.470
As you're about to leave,
Caleb, he grabs your shoulder

727
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:17.786
for a minute and is like,

728
00:30:17.786 --> 00:30:19.811
"If at all possible,

729
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.290
"because I helped author with
the completion of this,

730
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.690
"would I be able to make
a copy of this,

731
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.930
"but for my own records?"

732
00:30:30.779 --> 00:30:31.612
LIAM: Of course.

733
00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.868
I would not have been
able to do it without you.

734
00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:38.344
MATT: "Wonderful."
LIAM: This is your spell, as well as mine.

735
00:30:38.344 --> 00:30:39.302
MATT: "Thank you."

736
00:30:39.302 --> 00:30:41.773
LIAM: And the archmage's.

737
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:45.890
All right?

738
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.660
MARISHA: You all talk so closely when
you speak to one another.

739
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.640
LIAM: We didn't want to upset you.

740
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.030
I know how you get when
it flares like that.

741
00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.797
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: So let's get you home.

742
00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.298
And I start to walk Beauregard out.
MATT: Okay.

743
00:30:59.298 --> 00:31:01.539
TRAVIS: Okay. Here we go. We're out.

744
00:31:04.855 --> 00:31:07.660
All right.
TRAVIS: Once in the street.

745
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.694
Do you really have syphilis?

746
00:31:09.694 --> 00:31:10.527
MARISHA: No.

747
00:31:10.527 --> 00:31:13.250
SAM: Because everyone was
sharing a hot tub with you.

748
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.897
LAURA: What's going on?
MARISHA: I am a little itchy.

749
00:31:14.897 --> 00:31:16.140
TRAVIS: Yeah, seriously.
MARISHA: I feel splotchy.

750
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.810
SAM: Are you okay?
LAURA: You look splotchy.

751
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.500
What's going on, Beau?
TRAVIS: We're just trying to leave.

752
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.080
MARISHA: No, I just, well, I
was also just trying to leave.

753
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.990
LAURA: Oh my god, what
if there was some shit

754
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.590
in the clay or something?

755
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.750
Nott, how do you feel?

756
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.780
Maybe there were like parasites or something.

757
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.288
SAM: What the fuck are you talking about?

758
00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:31.971
She wasn't in the clay.

759
00:31:31.971 --> 00:31:33.795
ASHLEY: Are you actually itchy?

760
00:31:33.795 --> 00:31:37.778
MARISHA: No, I just, it's
all freakishly...

761
00:31:38.986 --> 00:31:40.150
familiar.

762
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.550
It's reminding me of stuff
that my father babbled about

763
00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.790
all the fucking time.
SAM: What is, my story?

764
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.183
LIAM: Let's take this back to the Xhorhaus.

765
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.033
MARISHA: Ugh.
LAURA: Okay.

766
00:31:52.889 --> 00:31:55.610
LIAM: And Caleb starts leading, just
walking towards the home, in hope--

767
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.490
LAURA: I'm pretty sure I broke the curse on Nott,

768
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.040
we should just try the spell again.

769
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.032
I'm pretty sure I broke it.

770
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.000
We should try it.

771
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.790
TALIESIN: Is there an actual rash happening here?

772
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.060
Is Beau--
MATT: Your perception of--

773
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.120
TALIESIN: My passive perception.
MATT: Of 19.

774
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.803
TALIESIN: Is, yeah, my passive
perception is like...

775
00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:20.953
cartoonishly--
MATT: Yeah.

776
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.380
Beyond just the red marks for her scratching,

777
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.630
doesn't appear to be any
sort of actual rash or--

778
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.320
LAURA: Just mentally itchy.

779
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.150
TALIESIN: Can I--
LIAM: Strip?

780
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:35.629
TALIESIN: Come over and just,
may I look at whatever--

781
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:37.520
TRAVIS: (low voice noises)
(laughter)

782
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.378
TALIESIN: Do you mind if I take--

783
00:32:39.378 --> 00:32:42.092
is that what itches over there?

784
00:32:42.092 --> 00:32:44.132
Are you actually having a rash?

785
00:32:44.132 --> 00:32:45.250
MARISHA: No, I think I just--

786
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:47.628
LAURA: No, these are just scratch
marks, I rub Beau's arm.

787
00:32:47.628 --> 00:32:50.780
Looks like scratch mark, she's scratching.

788
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.460
MARISHA: We're focusing on the wrong part

789
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.285
of the role play, everybody.

790
00:32:54.285 --> 00:32:57.057
(laughter)

791
00:32:57.057 --> 00:32:59.434
LAURA: So she's mentally itchy--
SAM: Allergic to a fabric or--

792
00:32:59.434 --> 00:33:00.820
(laughter)
is it--

793
00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.110
TALIESIN: Started wearing--
TRAVIS: Do you have an EpiPen?

794
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.280
EpiPen--
TALIESIN: Of course I carry an EpiPen.

795
00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.690
LIAM: Should never have touched that chair.

796
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.578
LAURA: So are we back at the Xhorhaus yet?

797
00:33:09.578 --> 00:33:11.470
SAM: Yes, oh, here we are at the Xhorhaus.

798
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:12.770
LAURA: Beau--
SAM: Let's make sure

799
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.650
we don't come in contact
with any synthetic fabrics.

800
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.840
ASHLEY: Need an antihistamine?
LAURA: Beau, sit down.

801
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.115
Nott, sit down.
Both of you, sit down.

802
00:33:20.115 --> 00:33:22.510
SAM: I think, in this instance,
we should definitely focus

803
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:26.880
on Beau, because she's in
way worse shape than I am.

804
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.730
MARISHA: An oatmeal bath or something.

805
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.240
ASHLEY: Here.

806
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.490
MARISHA: No, no, wait, that's not, no.

807
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.023
TRAVIS: What is that? What do you have?

808
00:33:34.023 --> 00:33:34.989
What do you have for her?

809
00:33:34.989 --> 00:33:36.750
ASHLEY: You said you had cottonmouth.

810
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.855
MARISHA: Oh yeah.
LIAM: That's a trumpet.

811
00:33:38.855 --> 00:33:41.510
TALIESIN: We just passed imaginary water.

812
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.343
Sorry.

813
00:33:42.343 --> 00:33:44.768
LIAM: She didn't say. Now it's trumpet.

814
00:33:45.963 --> 00:33:49.166
TRAVIS: Where do you find all
these instruments, Yasha?

815
00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:52.760
(laughter)

816
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.770
ASHLEY: I have learned that a
trumpet helps with cottonmouth.

817
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.170
TRAVIS: Oh.
MARISHA: Actually gets the saliva going--

818
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.007
ASHLEY: Saliva going.
TRAVIS: Yep. (blowing)

819
00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:05.461
MARISHA: (imitates a dying trumpet)

820
00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:06.937
LIAM: Rewind, rewind, rewind.

821
00:34:06.937 --> 00:34:08.722
MATT: Wow.

822
00:34:08.722 --> 00:34:10.165
TRAVIS: Yep. Off the rails.

823
00:34:10.165 --> 00:34:12.680
SAM: You said that it
reminded you of something.

824
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.513
What?

825
00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:19.890
MARISHA: My dad said he made a deal with a woman,

826
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.246
in the woods,

827
00:34:22.246 --> 00:34:27.050
like, an old fortune teller woman.

828
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.050
SAM: Okay?

829
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.550
LAURA: Did he say she had a weird
laugh, or that she was in robes

830
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.115
and she did something with goblins?

831
00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:36.438
TRAVIS: What was the deal for?

832
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:42.248
MARISHA: He wanted to be successful, and to be wealthy,

833
00:34:44.768 --> 00:34:48.060
and to have the ability to marry my mother.

834
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:53.060
He was just a poor asshole street urchin

835
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.707
who was in love with this lady of the town.

836
00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.855
SAM: And it worked?

837
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.090
MARISHA: In a way.

838
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:06.890
It's-- he built his entire fucking life

839
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:09.320
around this fortune teller,

840
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.170
around a fucking tarot deck, basically.

841
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.950
SAM: But did it work, is he rich?

842
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.230
Is he married to your mom?

843
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.630
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: She-- yeah.

844
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:23.010
But she said that he would just--

845
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:28.000
he would be successful
and that she told him

846
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.550
that he should start-- he
should buy a plot of land

847
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:36.240
and just try farming,
and he ended up buying

848
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.310
this shitty piece of land
that no one wanted

849
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.970
because they couldn't grow anything,

850
00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.940
and he was able to get grapes to grow,

851
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.360
and then he turned it into
this really successful winery,

852
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.019
but he busted his ass doing it.

853
00:35:48.019 --> 00:35:49.560
It wasn't that he--

854
00:35:51.585 --> 00:35:56.130
he had fortune, or the future told.

855
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.200
He just--
LAURA: But what about the woman?

856
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.390
SAM: It sounds like--
LAURA: What did she--

857
00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.519
TRAVIS: Did he say how he
found her? Like how, who--

858
00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:07.902
LAURA: Did she talk about debts or something?

859
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.200
LIAM: Also, you two live very
far away from each other.

860
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.225
LAURA: Do you?

861
00:36:14.225 --> 00:36:16.941
LIAM: Many fairy tales with
an old crone in the woods.

862
00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:18.320
LAURA: Well, here's the thing.

863
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.050
You're up here, right?

864
00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.330
Where are you, Beau?

865
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.250
TRAVIS: Yeah, Pride's Call.
LIAM: Beau is here.

866
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.100
Felderwin is over here.
LAURA: Yeah, but if she lives

867
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.308
in the mountains or something, maybe Beau's--

868
00:36:28.308 --> 00:36:31.130
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're only
like four inches from each other.

869
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.288
ASHLEY: Should we ask your dad?

870
00:36:32.288 --> 00:36:34.130
MARISHA: Does Mount Mentiri--

871
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.005
SAM: What is Mount Mentiri?
MARISHA: --ring a bell?

872
00:36:36.005 --> 00:36:38.437
SAM: What is that, what does that mean?

873
00:36:38.437 --> 00:36:41.362
MATT: Mount Mentiri actually
is right in this region.

874
00:36:41.362 --> 00:36:42.328
LAURA: See?

875
00:36:42.328 --> 00:36:44.540
That's days, that's a day,
that's a couple days

876
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.417
traveling from Felderwin.

877
00:36:47.417 --> 00:36:48.250
You could do it.

878
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.040
SAM: Is that where he met this woman?

879
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.530
MARISHA: He said he walked on foot,

880
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:56.500
he heard about some
woman who could trade.

881
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.570
SAM: She had a home in the
woods, in the mountains?

882
00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.060
MARISHA: She had a home in the woods, and
he just walked barefoot

883
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.920
until he eventually found her.

884
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.630
TALIESIN: I'm setting up a little circle.

885
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:09.213
MARISHA: And he asked how he
could find his own wealth, and...

886
00:37:09.213 --> 00:37:13.860
she told him that he would be successful,

887
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.800
and that he would have a successful winery,

888
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.500
and that he would marry the woman he loved,

889
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.060
and that he would birth a young beau

890
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.930
to inherit the family business.

891
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.080
TRAVIS: Well, he didn't do that--
MARISHA: And he took it so literally

892
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.550
that he named me Beau.

893
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.400
LAURA: Wow, your dad is super superstitious.

894
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.460
MARISHA: Yeah.

895
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.450
This piece of jade that he gave me,

896
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.930
it's the only thing that I keep on me.

897
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.250
It's the only real gift he ever gave me,

898
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.663
because he thought it would protect me.

899
00:37:43.663 --> 00:37:46.765
He always gave me
good luck trinkets.

900
00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:47.756
SAM: It's a piece of jade?

901
00:37:47.756 --> 00:37:50.698
TRAVIS: Are you sure it's
just a good luck trinket?

902
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:54.220
MARISHA: It's just a piece--
it's just a jade necklace.

903
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.920
TRAVIS: Holy shit, you never checked?

904
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.120
LAURA: Ooh, Caleb, check it out.
Is it fancy?

905
00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.240
SAM: I feel like, okay--

906
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.670
you know, it's been a rough day,
but in the last six hours

907
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.650
we've learned that Caduceus
and Fjord are brothers.

908
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.250
TRAVIS: We've not learned that.

909
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.570
SAM: And that-- we've learned
everything about you and me.

910
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.220
Maybe we should all just say everything
that's ever happened to us--

911
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.182
ASHLEY: I've told my story before.
SAM: -- in our lives.

912
00:38:14.182 --> 00:38:17.115
Well, I've told my story before.
Why didn't you hear it before?

913
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.654
MARISHA: Because it--

914
00:38:19.654 --> 00:38:22.745
a woman dousing you in a river

915
00:38:22.745 --> 00:38:24.250
could be any old woman.

916
00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.060
I didn't-- I don't know.

917
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.148
TRAVIS: It's hard to hear on
this side of the table.

918
00:38:28.148 --> 00:38:30.944
(laughter)

919
00:38:30.944 --> 00:38:33.100
TALIESIN: I have begun casting Commune.

920
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.609
MATT: Okay.

921
00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:36.450
MARISHA: I thought it was a coincidence.

922
00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.758
I didn't think it had any merit...

923
00:38:39.616 --> 00:38:42.449
to connect our pasts.

924
00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.570
It sounded vague enough, I don't know.

925
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:48.735
SAM: Can you ask your father what
this woman looked like?

926
00:38:48.735 --> 00:38:49.990
LAURA: What was her name?

927
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.757
SAM: Or where she was found, or--

928
00:38:54.126 --> 00:38:56.267
can you send him a message?

929
00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:57.480
You connected--
LAURA: I'll send him a message.

930
00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.730
SAM: -- with her father?
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

931
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.855
TRAVIS: Yeah, it freaks him out.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay,

932
00:39:01.855 --> 00:39:04.490
What if I send him a message,

933
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:05.930
I pretend to be the old woman--

934
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.188
SAM: Of course, that's a no-brainer.
LAURA: Yeah.

935
00:39:07.188 --> 00:39:08.387
TRAVIS: Didn't you do that once already?

936
00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:10.446
LAURA: Well, I didn't know who I was pretending to be--

937
00:39:10.446 --> 00:39:11.687
I just spit a little bit.

938
00:39:11.687 --> 00:39:13.770
I didn't know who I was pretending to be,

939
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.410
but this time, I will
pretend to be the old woman.

940
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.760
SAM: So you just say,
"Hi, I'm the old woman who--"

941
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.090
LAURA: What's my name?!
SAM: What's my name

942
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.988
and where do I live?
LAURA: Where do I live?!

943
00:39:24.988 --> 00:39:26.090
Tell me that.

944
00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.485
If you can tell me that, you're free from all your curses.

945
00:39:29.485 --> 00:39:31.570
Can I do that?
TALIESIN: (clears throat)

946
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.228
MATT: About that moment, you see Caduceus,

947
00:39:33.228 --> 00:39:36.850
who has prepared a small circle of trinkets, implements

948
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.650
are on the ground, fall into a momentary trace.

949
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.610
Caduceus, all the sounds of chatting and bickering

950
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:49.099
and confused, raised voices here in the house begin to fade,

951
00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:53.150
as you feel the familiar warm breeze blow over you.

952
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:55.602
You can sense the clouds above traveling

953
00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:57.740
at a far greater speed.

954
00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.370
Time begins to accelerate,

955
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.740
but slow to a crawl simultaneously,

956
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.773
and you feel the warm,

957
00:40:04.773 --> 00:40:08.731
familiar presence of your protector.

958
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.590
TALIESIN: Does the woman who cursed Nott live?

959
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.000
MATT: The breeze comes cold and biting,

960
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.690
not in a way to deny it, but in a way that shivers

961
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.532
the truth through you.

962
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:37.360
TALIESIN: Has this creature ever had a conversation

963
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.778
with Beau's father?

964
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.690
MATT: The cold breeze rescinds,

965
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.602
and then, blows with equal strength.

966
00:40:48.602 --> 00:40:52.240
SAM: Oh.

967
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.466
MARISHA: Was that a yes or a no?

968
00:40:53.466 --> 00:40:54.299
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: I think it's a no.

969
00:40:54.299 --> 00:40:55.399
SAM: Can't you read wind?

970
00:40:55.399 --> 00:40:57.582
(laughter)

971
00:40:57.582 --> 00:40:59.291
LIAM: That's a yes from me.

972
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.199
(laughter)

973
00:41:01.199 --> 00:41:02.715
LAURA: (blows air)

974
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:18.110
TALIESIN: Does my family wait for me at the Menagerie?

975
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.770
MATT: The cold breeze comes once more,

976
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:27.410
but this time, it turns warm,

977
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.301
to confirm as well,

978
00:41:30.301 --> 00:41:34.284
but this answer with less intensity.

979
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.342
But all confirmations nonetheless.

980
00:41:40.342 --> 00:41:42.950
TALIESIN: Good.

981
00:41:45.915 --> 00:41:49.360
(sighing) I regret my weakness.

982
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.450
LAURA: What did you learn, Caduceus?

983
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.550
SAM: What does that mean?

984
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.830
TALIESIN: We need to go see your father.

985
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.160
MARISHA: What do you mean, you regret your weakness?

986
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.460
TALIESIN: Oh, that wasn't for you.

987
00:42:01.004 --> 00:42:01.880
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

988
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.080
TALIESIN: We need to talk to your father.

989
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.170
MARISHA: I don't wanna?

990
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.690
LAURA: Oh yeah, but if we talk to your dad,

991
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.490
we don't have to go see the goblins.

992
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.920
TALIESIN: More to the point, we
don't know where the goblins are,

993
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.720
but we do know where your father is.

994
00:42:17.056 --> 00:42:18.550
TRAVIS: If you don't want to talk to your father,

995
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.430
I could do it.

996
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.870
Hi, I'm Beau, I don't give a fuck.

997
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:23.210
Fuck you, Dad.

998
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.483
MARISHA: That's pretty good, actually.

999
00:42:24.483 --> 00:42:25.480
(laughter)

1000
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.700
ASHLEY: When was the last time that you saw your dad?

1001
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:33.570
MARISHA: The night he slapped me across the face

1002
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:35.670
as I was getting drug out by the monks.

1003
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.060
TRAVIS: Ooh.

1004
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.910
LAURA: He slapped you as you were leaving?

1005
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.598
MARISHA: Yeah.

1006
00:42:41.598 --> 00:42:43.120
LAURA: I really don't like your dad.

1007
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.060
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm starting to like him even less

1008
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.560
than I did before.

1009
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.875
MARISHA: He's a complicated man.

1010
00:42:53.426 --> 00:42:55.926
TALIESIN: I don't know, that didn't sound too complicated.

1011
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:04.170
LIAM: Yeah, but for our friend, would you--

1012
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.553
would you?

1013
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.113
MARISHA: Yeah.

1014
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.140
LIAM: Thank you, Beauregard.

1015
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.263
SAM: Yes, thank you.

1016
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.750
But do we need to go there in person?

1017
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.010
It's very far away.

1018
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.489
LAURA: It's kind of close to Rexxentrum.

1019
00:43:25.489 --> 00:43:27.120
TRAVIS: How would we not go there in person?

1020
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.720
MARISHA: Closest to Zadash.

1021
00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.522
SAM: Can we just send a message or--?

1022
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.640
MARISHA: If we're going to go find
her, we got to go there anyway.

1023
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.473
TRAVIS: It's true.

1024
00:43:36.473 --> 00:43:37.900
LIAM: Yeah, we need to go to that region.

1025
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.193
We could warn your father that we are coming.

1026
00:43:40.193 --> 00:43:41.420
I could take us to Zadash.

1027
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.160
We could travel on foot.

1028
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.790
MARISHA: Well, I don't know if this is a conversation

1029
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.330
I want to have in 25 words.

1030
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:48.460
TALIESIN: We should go in person.

1031
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.920
LIAM: You want to just show up at the doorstep?

1032
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.380
SAM: Wait, wait--
MARISHA: He threw me off the doorstep

1033
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.310
so why can't I just fucking show up?

1034
00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.780
LAURA: That's right.
TALIESIN: I'll also point out--

1035
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.420
LAURA: Show up.

1036
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.990
TALIESIN: He'd have a hard time throwing you off

1037
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.650
the doorstep again at this point.

1038
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.483
TRAVIS: That's true.

1039
00:44:04.483 --> 00:44:07.050
LAURA: We could throw him off the doorstep,

1040
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.310
and slap him across the face, right as we do it.

1041
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:12.784
SAM: But also, being nice enough so that he'll tell us

1042
00:44:12.784 --> 00:44:13.730
the information that we're--

1043
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.652
LAURA: We can make him talk if we're mean.

1044
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.050
TRAVIS: Jesus, Jester.
TALIESIN: In all seriousness,

1045
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.380
I do have it on pretty good authority

1046
00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.960
that there is something to be gained,

1047
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.830
of seeing one's parents once we've matured enough

1048
00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:32.705
to see how fragile they are.

1049
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.857
SAM: I appreciate all of you,

1050
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:43.610
you know, committing to go and do these things on my behalf

1051
00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.090
but we had a plan. We have a plan.

1052
00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:50.207
We're going to Caduceus' family and we're going to meet--

1053
00:44:50.207 --> 00:44:53.130
we have to. I think we've-- have we sent the boat

1054
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.550
to meet us already or no?

1055
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.210
TRAVIS: It's weeks away.

1056
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.760
TALIESIN: Weeks.
MARISHA: We still have time.

1057
00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:03.750
SAM: But this is the other direction by thousands of miles.

1058
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.583
TALIESIN: Not really.

1059
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560
SAM: It is, though.

1060
00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.130
TRAVIS: The Menagerie is where?

1061
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.810
TALIESIN: South.
LIAM: Straight down.

1062
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.740
LAURA: I can just tell Orly. It's been like what? An hour?

1063
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.830
He hasn't left yet. I can tell Orly:

1064
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:20.321
Hey, don't meet us there. Meet us in Nicodranas.

1065
00:45:20.321 --> 00:45:24.330
SAM: It's not just about that.

1066
00:45:27.737 --> 00:45:28.950
I mean, there's no immediacy.

1067
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:31.540
We don't have to find this woman today.

1068
00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.540
Caduceus, you are on a path.

1069
00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.420
TALIESIN: I don't know if I'm quite ready yet.

1070
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.860
SAM: You seemed to be.

1071
00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.693
TALIESIN: Hmm.

1072
00:45:44.173 --> 00:45:45.006
I don't know.

1073
00:45:45.969 --> 00:45:47.270
SAM: I mean, it's not just you, either.

1074
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.257
You've got a brother now.

1075
00:45:49.257 --> 00:45:52.430
MARISHA: (laughs)

1076
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:54.798
TRAVIS: Ah-- ha, mm.

1077
00:45:54.798 --> 00:45:56.870
SAM: I mean, he wants to meet his family, too.

1078
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.268
TRAVIS: No, it's not, no, nope.

1079
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.370
SAM: I see the resemblance.

1080
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:08.020
LIAM: Listen, you can't deny the
immense coincidence involved.

1081
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.370
TRAVIS: Of course, yes.

1082
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.790
LIAM: That has to mean something.

1083
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.480
TRAVIS: I don't think it does.

1084
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.720
TALIESIN: I think it does mean something.

1085
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.987
I just don't necessarily think we know what it means.

1086
00:46:21.068 --> 00:46:21.901
And--

1087
00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:25.658
I've--

1088
00:46:25.658 --> 00:46:29.119
(laughter)

1089
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:31.270
SAM: I mean, it's pretty obvious.

1090
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:32.578
TALIESIN: No, it really isn't.

1091
00:46:32.578 --> 00:46:34.170
SAM: You have the same nose.

1092
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.850
TALIESIN: We really don't.
TRAVIS: No.

1093
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.630
He is a totally different--
TALIESIN: Literally,

1094
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:39.940
it couldn't be more different.

1095
00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.300
TRAVIS: His hair is far better than mine.

1096
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.850
TALIESIN: Thank you.
SAM: Accents are the same.

1097
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.720
TALIESIN: I like your hair.
LIAM: You share a calling.

1098
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.808
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Well, that.

1099
00:46:47.808 --> 00:46:49.597
LIAM: But just that, it's a lot.
SAM: No.

1100
00:46:49.597 --> 00:46:51.120
Yeah, that's a lot.

1101
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.750
MARISHA: And sometimes, coincidences are just coincidences.

1102
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.700
TRAVIS: Exactly.

1103
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.290
LAURA: Sometimes, though, it means that, you know,

1104
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.270
your dad interacted with the person

1105
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:03.250
that cursed your friend.

1106
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:04.777
MARISHA: Do we know that for sure, or is that--

1107
00:47:04.777 --> 00:47:07.955
LAURA: Yeah. We got confirmation from the Wildmother.

1108
00:47:07.955 --> 00:47:09.370
TALIESIN: It's--
SAM: Yeah, I mean--

1109
00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.020
TALIESIN: We're going the right direction.

1110
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.430
SAM: Fjord talked to the Wild, oh, I'm sorry.

1111
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:14.920
You're Caduceus.

1112
00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.620
I get them mixed up sometimes,

1113
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.103
because they're so similar.

1114
00:47:18.103 --> 00:47:20.375
(laughter)

1115
00:47:20.375 --> 00:47:21.620
TALIESIN: It's bothered me.

1116
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.740
I've been trying to think of a way to help you through it

1117
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.567
for a long while, Nott, and what I can do to--

1118
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.200
Everyone else is easier to help with their struggles.

1119
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.550
You are complicated, and it's been difficult in this,

1120
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:38.540
and it's nice to finally have a path forward

1121
00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.053
as a way to help you.

1122
00:47:40.053 --> 00:47:42.880
TRAVIS: Yes, plus what if this is not the only hold

1123
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.760
that she has over you?

1124
00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.770
I mean, she prevented the tremendously powerful spell

1125
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:48.603
from taking effect.

1126
00:47:48.603 --> 00:47:50.840
What if there's something else?

1127
00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.760
We have to find out what this leads to.

1128
00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.040
We don't have to confront your dad,

1129
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.330
or even involve you if you're really uncomfortable about it.

1130
00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:59.670
We're not forcing anybody to do anything,

1131
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:03.050
but I think we need to clear your ledger.

1132
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.850
MATT: You do have access to the library,

1133
00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.360
to research if you wanted to.

1134
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.450
MARISHA: In Zadash?

1135
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.060
MATT: Well, in pretty much any of the Cobalt Soul Libraries,

1136
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.710
but that's the nearest one there.

1137
00:48:13.538 --> 00:48:16.290
LIAM: It's all you-- <i>we</i> have been working toward.

1138
00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.710
SAM: I know, but if I'm being honest,

1139
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:24.230
we got so close, and I think I had a little bit

1140
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.167
of cold feet.

1141
00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.973
LIAM: What do you mean?

1142
00:48:28.973 --> 00:48:30.073
LAURA: How do you feel now?

1143
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.240
MARISHA: You got really close. You committed to it.

1144
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.520
SAM: I know.
LAURA: Do you feel relief?

1145
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.953
SAM: A little bit, yeah.

1146
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:41.950
LAURA: Sometimes, when you play eenie, meenie, miny moe,

1147
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:43.420
because you don't know which choice you want,

1148
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.370
and then you get to the moe,

1149
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.250
and then, you know at the end if you wanted the thing

1150
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.040
or if you didn't want the thing by what you land on.

1151
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.090
You know what I mean?

1152
00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.840
It makes the choice for you when you find out

1153
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.673
what you can and can't do.

1154
00:48:54.673 --> 00:48:56.139
LIAM: I know what you mean.

1155
00:48:56.139 --> 00:48:57.555
SAM: I do know what you mean.

1156
00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.110
But--
TALIESIN: Well put.

1157
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.930
SAM: I mean, I can't, I have to pursue it.

1158
00:49:09.158 --> 00:49:10.990
I do want to be me again.

1159
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.450
It just, it was happening so fast.

1160
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.640
It was a little scary.

1161
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.310
I mean, Caduceus, you said you're not ready yet.

1162
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.340
I don't know if <i>I'm</i> ready yet.

1163
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.970
MARISHA: I don't know if I'm ready to see my dad yet,

1164
00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:30.615
but that's a bunch of us

1165
00:49:31.793 --> 00:49:34.660
waiting for something to happen to us.

1166
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.801
TALIESIN: And I've accepted the inevitability that

1167
00:49:36.801 --> 00:49:40.767
when we head towards the Traveler,

1168
00:49:40.767 --> 00:49:43.322
that we're going to be right where I need to be,

1169
00:49:43.322 --> 00:49:44.970
and that's inevitable.

1170
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.998
That's gravity pulling me there.

1171
00:49:48.833 --> 00:49:51.300
I think we have to spend the time before that

1172
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.200
doing as much as we can for everybody.

1173
00:49:54.678 --> 00:49:57.150
TRAVIS: How long has it been, Beau,
since you've seen your father?

1174
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:58.455
How many years?

1175
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:00.820
MARISHA: Two, three?

1176
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.816
MATT: Close to three years.
MARISHA: Three?

1177
00:50:03.816 --> 00:50:05.860
TRAVIS: A lot can happen in that amount of time.

1178
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.990
SAM: How would we get there?

1179
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.380
TALIESIN: Teleport.
MARISHA: We teleport to Zadash.

1180
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.240
SAM: It's still days away.

1181
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.370
LAURA: A couple days.
LIAM: A few days,

1182
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:19.210
but that would take us to Nicodranas.

1183
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.860
MARISHA: It's not that far on horseback.

1184
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:23.980
I know, I've done the trek.

1185
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:26.583
TRAVIS: Yeah, we ride.

1186
00:50:26.583 --> 00:50:28.617
ASHLEY: Has he reached out to you since?

1187
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.607
MARISHA: I got a letter from my mother,

1188
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.830
about six months or so, maybe more,

1189
00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:39.471
being at the Cobalt Soul,

1190
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:43.946
saying, um...

1191
00:50:46.303 --> 00:50:48.220
that they had been granted

1192
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.728
their greatest wish and had a son.

1193
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.383
Named him Thoreau, Jr. after my father.

1194
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.640
SAM: How many years ago?

1195
00:51:02.868 --> 00:51:04.560
MARISHA: I guess he's like two now.

1196
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.560
LAURA: You've never met your brother?

1197
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.950
ASHLEY: Do you want to?

1198
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.210
MARISHA: It's hard to even think of him as my brother.

1199
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:17.973
LAURA: Why?

1200
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.073
MARISHA: No connection or context for the kid.

1201
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:25.761
He's just a name and a letter.

1202
00:51:25.761 --> 00:51:26.880
LAURA: Do you wonder if, when you see him,

1203
00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.930
you'll feel that way?

1204
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:29.903
MARISHA: Maybe.

1205
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.760
SAM: You said that the woman told your father

1206
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.090
that he would have a beau,

1207
00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.550
and that that would do what?

1208
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:45.660
That that would complete the spell or what is that?

1209
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.910
MARISHA: Young beau to take on his name,

1210
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:52.920
continue his bloodline, and take over his family business

1211
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.090
and all of those things.

1212
00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:57.760
LAURA: I thought beau means like--
SAM: Boy.

1213
00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.730
LAURA: Your boyfriend or something.

1214
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:01.500
SAM: Or boy.
LAURA: Oh, it's just a boy?

1215
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.340
SAM: I think so.

1216
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.250
MARISHA: It has a few different interpretations.

1217
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.150
And he thought he was getting a boy,

1218
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:11.640
so as soon as my mom got pregnant,

1219
00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.252
he got really set on that son.

1220
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.820
And you know, for a long time,

1221
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.470
I tried to bend my life to what he wanted.

1222
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:26.840
I was willing to take over the family business.

1223
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:31.970
I just wanted to do it my way,

1224
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.280
and he didn't want that.

1225
00:52:36.712 --> 00:52:38.260
ASHLEY: What does your way look like?

1226
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:46.110
MARISHA: I liked traveling and fighting,

1227
00:52:48.026 --> 00:52:49.600
and talking to people, so.

1228
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:55.670
I wanted to take the Lionett wine,

1229
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.720
and take it to neighboring cities,

1230
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.400
and expand it into Zadash, and we'd get this big name

1231
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.520
and I tried to convince him several times to load up a cart

1232
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.240
and a couple horses, and give me a few crates

1233
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.600
and let me take off and see what I could do,

1234
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.710
selling crates to different taverns,

1235
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:15.110
anyone who would take it.

1236
00:53:17.008 --> 00:53:19.000
And he thought that that was a useless waste of time,

1237
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.450
and that I would get hurt, something would happen to me.

1238
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:26.230
And that it was best if I just learned

1239
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:29.805
how to crunch numbers

1240
00:53:29.805 --> 00:53:32.055
and do accounting and balance books.

1241
00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:33.880
He didn't want me to leave.

1242
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.490
He never wanted me to leave, because he was terrified

1243
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.063
that fate was going to come knocking at his door.

1244
00:53:44.801 --> 00:53:48.150
And then, one day, I realized that I was building

1245
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:52.130
my whole life around what someone else told him

1246
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.930
his life was going to be,

1247
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.590
and that it was this endless fucking cycle

1248
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:00.478
of everyone chasing a destiny.

1249
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.010
LIAM: Empire fathers do love their sons.

1250
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.500
MARISHA: Yes, they do.

1251
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.020
LAURA: Sounds like he was very protective of you.

1252
00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:09.853
MARISHA: He was.

1253
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:12.620
It always felt selfish,

1254
00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.510
like if something happened to me,

1255
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.100
his entire fucking dynasty

1256
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.950
would come crumbling down around him.

1257
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.910
TRAVIS: We have a picture of your family now;

1258
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.740
they're very successful in this area.

1259
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.290
Does that mean that you have lived on an estate?

1260
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.210
Is there security?

1261
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.760
Does your father have men?

1262
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.240
Or is it as simple as walking up and knocking on the door?

1263
00:54:36.332 --> 00:54:41.332
MARISHA: Pretty big winery, big house, a few stories.

1264
00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.203
Very upper-class life that he built.

1265
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.510
Does my dad have any men?

1266
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:48.610
Would he have bodyguards?

1267
00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.000
Maybe a couple?

1268
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.530
MATT: He'd probably have a couple of folks

1269
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:55.847
that work to both just watch the premises they lived at

1270
00:54:55.847 --> 00:54:58.860
and to keep watch on storage

1271
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.040
of their wines, as well as the process.

1272
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.480
MARISHA: I relay the message.

1273
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.350
ASHLEY: Does he know how capable you are in battle, Beau?

1274
00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:08.185
Because you're one of the best fighters I've ever seen.

1275
00:55:10.458 --> 00:55:11.908
MARISHA: I don't know what he knows.

1276
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:14.203
SAM: Hmm.

1277
00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.890
MARISHA: Him giving me away was the greatest thing

1278
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.140
that ever happened to me.

1279
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.900
It led me to all of you.

1280
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.180
LAURA: We should let him know that.

1281
00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:32.086
LIAM: Let him see what got away.

1282
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:37.260
We have to speak to him.

1283
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.950
Even if we don't go trudging into the mountains

1284
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.850
or into the middle of a goblin camp,

1285
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:42.800
we need to find out.

1286
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.040
We have talked about it for (sighs) ages.

1287
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.410
SAM: Yeah, I know.

1288
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.820
I know, yes, you're right.

1289
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.903
You're right.

1290
00:55:51.903 --> 00:55:54.450
LIAM: And we have the time now.

1291
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:57.810
We can follow this trail as far as we want,

1292
00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:00.142
and Beau can lead.

1293
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:07.300
SAM: Yes, and I suppose, even after we find this woman,

1294
00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.680
we don't have to do the thing right away, if--

1295
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.890
LAURA: Exactly.
SAM: If I'm not feeling it.

1296
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:18.550
Right? We can--
LIAM: It is an open offer.

1297
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:21.530
LAURA: We go find the woman, we destroy her,

1298
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:24.510
or we destroy the curse, whichever.

1299
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:26.210
TALIESIN: At least we take a step in that direction.

1300
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:30.620
LAURA: And then, you can be free to do whatever you want to.

1301
00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.477
SAM: If we destroy her or destroy her magic,

1302
00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:37.780
does that somehow mean that Beau's father

1303
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.950
will lose everything?

1304
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:41.080
LAURA: Hmm.

1305
00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.290
TALIESIN: I don't think so.

1306
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:43.123
LAURA: Possible.

1307
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:45.850
MARISHA: I don't think so, either.

1308
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:49.120
SAM: Like he won't die or anything, right?

1309
00:56:50.221 --> 00:56:52.250
It won't be like a Back to the Future situation?

1310
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:53.320
LAURA: Maybe it will protect him,

1311
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.010
because whatever deal he made with her,

1312
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:57.800
I'm sure she traded something pretty valuable for it.

1313
00:56:58.712 --> 00:56:59.830
TRAVIS: I don't know if there's any way to know.

1314
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:04.058
I threw the sword in the lava, and that was it.

1315
00:57:07.999 --> 00:57:09.310
LIAM: I'm sure if we did--

1316
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:10.410
SAM: You're Fjord, right?

1317
00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.270
MARISHA: That was it for Uk'otoa.

1318
00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.123
Sorry I dropped my staff again.

1319
00:57:18.123 --> 00:57:19.550
TRAVIS: You got to stop doing that.

1320
00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.420
It's getting tinier and tinier each time.

1321
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.398
It's splintering into pieces.

1322
00:57:23.398 --> 00:57:24.320
Let me get it for you--
MARISHA: Should get a new one.

1323
00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.353
Thank you, thank you.

1324
00:57:26.353 --> 00:57:28.153
TRAVIS: (whooshing)

1325
00:57:28.153 --> 00:57:31.078
MARISHA: It's nunchuks now, dope!

1326
00:57:31.078 --> 00:57:34.100
LIAM: I don't know, I think if we did destroy this woman,

1327
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.190
it would not undo time.

1328
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:40.650
It would, maybe at worst spoil the land, if that.

1329
00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.910
SAM: Well, it's evening now?

1330
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:50.470
MATT: No, after all the work and preparing

1331
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.920
for the ritual that you guys did, it's afternoon.

1332
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.977
SAM: I mean, do we go now?

1333
00:57:55.977 --> 00:57:58.870
TALIESIN: I say we go now.
LAURA: Let's go.

1334
00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:00.260
MARISHA: If we're going through Zadash,

1335
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.010
and we're going through the Cobalt Soul,

1336
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:04.570
we can do a little bit of research first before we leave.

1337
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:05.670
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1338
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:07.260
LAURA: Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.

1339
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.950
TALIESIN: I say we go now, and then get horses,

1340
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:11.020
and leave in the morning from--

1341
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.980
MARISHA: Yeah, we can always stay the night in my room.

1342
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.810
LAURA: Oh, yeah, all of us just pile in?

1343
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.333
MARISHA: Yeah.

1344
00:58:17.333 --> 00:58:18.283
TRAVIS: This is exciting.

1345
00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:20.710
Totally serious, but exciting.

1346
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:23.533
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, it's exciting, yeah.

1347
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.430
Yep.

1348
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:27.855
LAURA: Doing it?

1349
00:58:27.855 --> 00:58:28.796
We're doing it?
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

1350
00:58:28.796 --> 00:58:29.852
We're on our way.
MARISHA: All right.

1351
00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:33.700
All right, hang on, everyone.
Make sure everything's unplugged.

1352
00:58:34.891 --> 00:58:36.390
Turn off the hot water heater.

1353
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.290
ASHLEY: Oven's off.

1354
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:38.811
MARISHA: All right.

1355
00:58:38.811 --> 00:58:40.810
I'm going to go upstairs, check everything.

1356
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.760
SAM: It looks like some fruit over here.

1357
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.910
Should we throw--
LAURA: Just take it.

1358
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:45.970
No, put it in my bag, put it my bag.

1359
00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:47.710
TALIESIN: Compost into the kitchen--

1360
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:50.600
SAM: I mean, what are we going to do with 12 oranges?

1361
00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.870
LAURA: Take them with us.
SAM: Really?

1362
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:52.703
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: All right.

1363
00:58:52.703 --> 00:58:54.320
LAURA: I will eat that shit.

1364
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.320
LIAM: Caleb goes to their shared laboratory,

1365
00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.940
and just does 90% of what is required to travel to Zadash.

1366
00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.280
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Waits til everyone is ready.

1367
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.113
MATT: Fair enough.

1368
00:59:02.113 --> 00:59:03.329
TALIESIN: Drain the hot tub.

1369
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.281
MATT: You drain your hot tub.

1370
00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:07.872
(laughter)

1371
00:59:08.798 --> 00:59:11.847
LAURA: Oh, man, that's going to
take forever to fill back up.

1372
00:59:11.847 --> 00:59:13.370
TRAVIS: You don't want to come back to the green water.

1373
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.820
It's terrible.
LAURA: (gagging)

1374
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.237
TALIESIN: Best for everything.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1375
00:59:17.237 --> 00:59:19.137
SAM: Get syphilis from it.
MATT: All righty.

1376
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.910
Is there anything specific anyone needs to prep

1377
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:23.280
before you make your way

1378
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.150
towards Caleb's Teleportation Circle?

1379
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:27.113
LIAM: You ready?
TALIESIN: I feel pretty good.

1380
00:59:27.113 --> 00:59:28.412
LIAM: Here we go.

1381
00:59:28.412 --> 00:59:30.050
LAURA: Do we need to prep anything?

1382
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.400
MARISHA: The back of my neck is really sweaty.

1383
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.450
LIAM: Psyche yourself up.
MARISHA: Ugh.

1384
00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:36.040
SAM: We don't need to tell Essek we're leaving,

1385
00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:36.980
we don't need to do anything.

1386
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:38.430
We're just going to go.

1387
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.010
LAURA: I'm going to Essek we're leaving.

1388
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:41.210
LIAM: Yeah, last thing I said to him

1389
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.448
is that we would see him soon.

1390
00:59:42.448 --> 00:59:44.840
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I'm going to send Essek a message.

1391
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.270
MATT: All right.

1392
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:49.460
LAURA: Hey, Essek, we're going to
find that evil laughing lady

1393
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:52.910
so that means we'll be back, I don't know when.

1394
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.410
We'll be at the negotiations, though, don't worry.

1395
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.800
Breakfast was fun.

1396
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.577
MATT: He got most of that.
LAURA: Okay.

1397
01:00:00.577 --> 01:00:02.350
MATT: (chuckles)
TRAVIS: I forgot to count.

1398
01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:04.610
MATT: He responds,

1399
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.210
"Very well.

1400
01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:08.110
"I have my own business to attend to, as well.

1401
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:12.100
"So good luck, and I'm sure we'll cross paths

1402
01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.158
"again very soon."

1403
01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.700
LAURA: He says he loves you so much, Caleb.

1404
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.750
SAM: What?

1405
01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:19.191
TRAVIS: He did?

1406
01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:22.108
LAURA: Yeah, he was like, "Caleb--"
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, insight check, yeah.

1407
01:00:25.016 --> 01:00:26.263
TALIESIN: That was great.

1408
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.350
LIAM: That is a 23.
LAURA: Aw.

1409
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.090
(laughter)

1410
01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:34.319
MATT: Make a deception check, Jester.

1411
01:00:34.319 --> 01:00:35.735
(laughter)

1412
01:00:35.735 --> 01:00:38.161
TRAVIS: Roll versus roll! Boom!

1413
01:00:38.161 --> 01:00:39.104
LAURA: Aww!

1414
01:00:39.104 --> 01:00:40.795
(laughter)

1415
01:00:40.795 --> 01:00:41.753
LAURA: Seven.

1416
01:00:45.973 --> 01:00:47.740
MATT: All righty.

1417
01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.000
You've gathered your things from the Xhorhaus--

1418
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.170
TRAVIS: Fuck me.
MATT: You go and meet Caleb

1419
01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.340
in the laboratory as he
completes the majority

1420
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.810
of the teleportation circle
with the central sigil

1421
01:00:57.810 --> 01:01:00.510
that leads you towards Zadash.

1422
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:01.343
TALIESIN: Zadash.

1423
01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.500
MATT: He finishes the final marking,

1424
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.590
you see it light up in the familiar sense.

1425
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.030
The doorway is open.

1426
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:10.651
You rush through, one after another--

1427
01:01:10.651 --> 01:01:12.800
SAM: Were we supposed warn
them we're coming?

1428
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.734
(laughter)

1429
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.433
LIAM: Oh, shi--

1430
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.640
TALIESIN: We are the worst.

1431
01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:24.638
Oh.

1432
01:01:24.638 --> 01:01:26.168
LIAM: It's too much to track, man.

1433
01:01:26.168 --> 01:01:27.368
It's so much to track.

1434
01:01:27.368 --> 01:01:30.540
MATT: You return to the familiar
underground teleportation nexus

1435
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.200
of the Cobalt Soul where two of the guards,

1436
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.670
suddenly spin around--

1437
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:38.270
MARISHA: I'm sorry, I'm-- I'm sorry.

1438
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:41.350
LIAM: I didn't meant to do
the last marking on the floor.

1439
01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:43.420
I got a little overexcited--

1440
01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.860
MATT: "It's all right, it's all right."

1441
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.693
MARISHA: Forgetting the protocol.

1442
01:01:46.693 --> 01:01:47.830
LAURA: It's my bad.

1443
01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.790
I-- remember, I'm the one that does it.

1444
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:50.740
I should've sent a message.

1445
01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.690
MARISHA: It was a Sunday, I wasn't thinking of people

1446
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:55.170
being in on office hours.

1447
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.830
TRAVIS: What's Sunday?
LAURA: What's a Sunday?

1448
01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:01.364
LIAM: There's sun every day.
(laughter)

1449
01:02:01.364 --> 01:02:04.980
TRAVIS: That syphilis is hitting the mind real hard.

1450
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.252
SAM: Oh, that's fast.
(laughter)

1451
01:02:07.252 --> 01:02:08.740
There's the itch.
MARISHA: It itches.

1452
01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.550
SAM: Then you lose track of the days,

1453
01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:13.866
then your ears fall off.

1454
01:02:13.866 --> 01:02:15.650
(laughter)

1455
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:17.854
LIAM: You're the old crone, it's you.

1456
01:02:17.854 --> 01:02:21.130
LAURA: (laughing)

1457
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:23.040
TRAVIS: Let's research some shit.
MARISHA: All right.

1458
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.279
MATT: You have access to the Cobalt Soul.

1459
01:02:24.279 --> 01:02:26.761
If there's anything you want to
specifically try and research,

1460
01:02:26.761 --> 01:02:28.400
now is the time to do so.

1461
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.390
SAM: Is there a book on old women?

1462
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:33.790
MARISHA: Old hags in woods?
SAM: Who can grant wishes?

1463
01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.510
MARISHA: Is there-- there's got to be, right?

1464
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:38.242
LAURA: Like myths, local myths?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

1465
01:02:38.242 --> 01:02:39.800
MATT: Well, what is it your trying to research

1466
01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.592
I guess is more the question?

1467
01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:45.520
LIAM: Otherworldly deal-makers.

1468
01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.540
MARISHA: Old ladies in woods.

1469
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:50.030
LAURA: Women that trade in fortune.

1470
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:52.120
TALIESIN: The mysterious women who grant wishes

1471
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.928
who live in the forest calendar of this year.

1472
01:02:54.928 --> 01:02:56.943
(laughter)

1473
01:02:56.943 --> 01:02:57.968
It's got to be a calendar.

1474
01:02:57.968 --> 01:03:00.170
TRAVIS: There are no titles matching that search.

1475
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:03.520
TALIESIN: I found a calendar
for men with plants this week,

1476
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.610
I'm not kidding, it was just
pictures of men with plants.

1477
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:07.800
They've got a calendar for everything.

1478
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.290
SAM: Don't google that.
MATT: So--

1479
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:11.530
LAURA: Oh boy.
(laughter)

1480
01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:12.880
MATT: That Taliesin endorsed.

1481
01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.290
Who wants to research what?

1482
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:16.510
What preparation are you doing?

1483
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:18.280
Who's looking for what?

1484
01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.500
MARISHA: I'm going to hit local myths.

1485
01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.990
MATT: Local myths.

1486
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:24.480
MARISHA: That sound like old hags in--

1487
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.999
LIAM: Yeah, fairy tales in Kamordah.

1488
01:03:26.999 --> 01:03:30.980
I will assist Beauregard.
SAM: I'm going to do some research, too.

1489
01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.521
I'm going to do...

1490
01:03:33.438 --> 01:03:38.438
any books about goblin movements around--

1491
01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:40.170
goblin, goblin shit.
MATT: Okay.

1492
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.350
Goblin travel patterns.

1493
01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.650
Go ahead and make-- if you're assisting,

1494
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:45.831
go ahead and make an investigation
check with advantage.

1495
01:03:48.023 --> 01:03:49.720
MARISHA: ♪ Yay for advantage. ♪

1496
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.480
24.
MATT: 24.

1497
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.200
MARISHA: Oh, 23, 23.
MATT: 23.

1498
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.817
Still pretty damn good.

1499
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:58.473
That's actually really good, okay.

1500
01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:05.330
So what you end up finding is a record of

1501
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:12.620
somewhat, I'd say known,
but at least spoken about

1502
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:16.340
soothsayers and hermits that fit similar

1503
01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.260
to the realm of what you're looking for,

1504
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.130
within the region of the Marrow Valley.

1505
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:24.048
There's a number of them,
and some that are up north.

1506
01:04:24.048 --> 01:04:26.360
There are some that, you know,

1507
01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.680
wander through the Cyrios Mountains.

1508
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.930
On the Menagerie Coast side,

1509
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:33.330
there's talk of one hermit that lives

1510
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:37.113
way, way out in the Menagerie Coast, this...

1511
01:04:38.872 --> 01:04:42.840
female protector of
the island creatures.

1512
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.350
All these different, unique stories and stuff.

1513
01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:46.340
There's one that you--
there's two that you find

1514
01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.890
that are local to the
area you're looking

1515
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:50.640
in the Marrow Valley.

1516
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.760
One is Isharnai, the Prism Sage.

1517
01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.610
MARISHA: Ashani--
MATT: Isharnai, the Prism Sage.

1518
01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:00.840
TRAVIS: Do I dare ask you to spell that?

1519
01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.015
MATT: I-S-H-A-R-N-A-I.

1520
01:05:04.015 --> 01:05:05.640
MARISHA: Isharnai.

1521
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.090
TRAVIS: The Prison Sage?
LAURA: The Prism?

1522
01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:08.200
MATT: The Prism Sage.

1523
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.970
A woman who lives alone among
the Cyrios Mountain Woods,

1524
01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:14.600
north of the Bromkiln Hills.

1525
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.500
She wields strange magics,
weaving boons and hexes

1526
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.640
for those who make the journey to find her.

1527
01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.000
Demanding high prices for her deeds,

1528
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.250
sometimes beyond mere coin.

1529
01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.250
You also find Old Masqier.

1530
01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.920
MARISHA: Old?
MATT: Old Masqier.

1531
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.094
MARISHA: Mask?
MATT: M-A-S-Q-I-E-R.

1532
01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.230
LAURA: Mm, okay.
TALIESIN: Oh.

1533
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:34.685
LAURA: Yeah, that's a better spelling.

1534
01:05:34.685 --> 01:05:39.685
MATT: Old Masqier is a gnarled
gnome of terse temperament,

1535
01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:42.740
who migrates through
the Cyrengreen Forest.

1536
01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.060
Known to take sides with
the forest over civilization,

1537
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.230
he has both been a healer
and an adversary to some

1538
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:49.010
over the decades, depending on the disposition

1539
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:51.500
when encountering them.

1540
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.520
SAM: That's a man--
LAURA: That's a gnome?

1541
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.723
A gnomish man?
MATT: Yes.

1542
01:05:54.723 --> 01:05:56.106
LIAM: That's a wandering druid.

1543
01:05:56.106 --> 01:05:58.414
LAURA: That sounds like not the right one.
SAM: What was his name? Old--

1544
01:05:58.414 --> 01:05:59.455
LAURA: Old Maqier.

1545
01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.080
MATT: Old Masqier.
LAURA: Masqier.

1546
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.280
MARISHA: The Cyrengreen Forest,
is that what you said?

1547
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.738
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Common sense.

1548
01:06:04.738 --> 01:06:06.308
TRAVIS: Where is that?

1549
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.860
MATT: The Cyrengreen Forest is here.

1550
01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.980
TRAVIS: Okay.

1551
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.971
LAURA: Okay.

1552
01:06:11.971 --> 01:06:14.405
MATT: And the other is north of Bromkiln Hills.

1553
01:06:14.405 --> 01:06:16.005
LAURA: North of the Bromkiln Hills.

1554
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.965
TALIESIN: I'm excited by both these options.

1555
01:06:19.965 --> 01:06:21.805
MARISHA: Well it's not Old Masqier.

1556
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.650
LAURA: It's got to be Isharnai.

1557
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:27.000
MARISHA: Is that it, or are those the--

1558
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.890
MATT: Those are the two that find that match

1559
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:32.190
what you're looking for loosely,

1560
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:36.820
as far as hermited sages and you know,

1561
01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.550
soothsayers, people that
deal in the sort of stuff

1562
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:42.330
that you're looking for in the region.

1563
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.130
MARISHA: Any other detail on Isharnai?

1564
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.100
Is she old?

1565
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:55.100
Does it say how long these
stories go back, anything?

1566
01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:58.427
MATT: The stories go back about 50 or so years.

1567
01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:01.610
MARISHA: That doesn't feel right.

1568
01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:05.260
MATT: And they're just, you know,

1569
01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.440
loose mutterings of people who had encounters

1570
01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.340
with both of them.

1571
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.860
LIAM: Here's another stack, try these.

1572
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.026
MARISHA: Mm, okay.

1573
01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:17.660
All right.

1574
01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.430
This-- that's my roll.

1575
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:21.297
LIAM: It's pretty good.
MARISHA: Right?

1576
01:07:21.297 --> 01:07:22.130
MATT: Yeah.

1577
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:24.707
LAURA: Hey, maybe I can try
scrying on Isharnai.

1578
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.810
Describe what she looks like again.

1579
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:34.330
SAM: Well, she's a human,
so sort of like Beau,

1580
01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:37.110
except way older.
LAURA: Okay.

1581
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:41.760
SAM: And not strong like Beau?

1582
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.031
And also, with a hood, and also,

1583
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:48.830
not looking anything like
Beauregard in any way.

1584
01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:51.150
LAURA: So just basically human.

1585
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:52.350
SAM: Like a human.

1586
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:54.199
LAURA: Like an old ass human.

1587
01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:57.283
SAM: Yeah, yeah, like saggy jowls, and--

1588
01:07:57.283 --> 01:07:59.540
LAURA: Are you sure it was a
human and not like a half-elf?

1589
01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.980
SAM: You know what, I'm really not, no.

1590
01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.210
LAURA: Humanoid, old ass humanoid.

1591
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:06.890
SAM: Old ass humanoid.
LAURA: In robes.

1592
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:10.130
SAM: Yeah, that day.
LAURA: Okay.

1593
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:14.150
SAM: And she said, "Debt paid,"
and her voice sounded

1594
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:16.270
like this, "A debt paid."

1595
01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:18.000
LAURA: It sounded like you.

1596
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.430
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

1597
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.313
MATT: Well, if you want, roll
an intelligence check for me.

1598
01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.270
SAM: Just a straight intelligence?

1599
01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:26.380
13.
MATT: 13.

1600
01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:27.970
Okay, you have a fairly decent recollection

1601
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.353
of what she looks like from
the brief moment you encountered.

1602
01:08:30.353 --> 01:08:32.580
You actually have a pretty good mental image.

1603
01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.570
LAURA: Can you make yourself look like her?

1604
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:36.350
SAM: I can try.

1605
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.360
I will cast whatever that is.

1606
01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.743
LAURA: Disguise Self?
SAM: Disguise Self, thank you.

1607
01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:43.510
And do my best.

1608
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.570
There's some blurry bits.
LAURA: Okay.

1609
01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:48.530
MATT: Yeah, there's no hood
beyond the one that Nott has,

1610
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:50.300
so there's no clothing element to it,

1611
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.150
but from the face that you can see,

1612
01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:54.840
you see what appears to
be a humanoid woman,

1613
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.380
elongated features,

1614
01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:01.920
very high cheekbones that ride

1615
01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.200
the side of the face back far,

1616
01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.620
jowls that seem very deep,
but then hang below,

1617
01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:10.560
almost like a Droopy Dog type--

1618
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.990
LAURA: Ugh.
MATT: -- aesthetic.

1619
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:14.550
MARISHA: Droopy Dog.
MATT: But far less adorable.

1620
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.266
TRAVIS: (as Droopy Dog) Oh, shit.

1621
01:09:16.266 --> 01:09:17.474
(laughter)

1622
01:09:19.228 --> 01:09:21.753
MATT: And these dull, green eyes.

1623
01:09:21.753 --> 01:09:23.143
LAURA: Does she look human to me,

1624
01:09:23.143 --> 01:09:24.760
or does she look like otherworldly to me?

1625
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:28.130
MATT: It rides a line.
LAURA: Okay.

1626
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.443
SAM: And because I didn't see her hair--
LIAM: It's pretty stretched.

1627
01:09:30.443 --> 01:09:31.910
SAM: I'm going to just make it a mohawk.

1628
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:34.160
And because I didn't see
her body very much,

1629
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.156
I'm just going to make it
look like three kobolds.

1630
01:09:37.156 --> 01:09:39.387
(laughter)

1631
01:09:39.387 --> 01:09:42.930
LAURA: I'm going to focus on the face.
(laughter)

1632
01:09:44.155 --> 01:09:46.230
MATT: But it is quite a
sight for the rest of you.

1633
01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:47.560
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1634
01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.330
I'm going to try and scry on her.

1635
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:52.693
MATT: Okay, so you're saying
you're going to attempt a scry ritual.

1636
01:09:52.693 --> 01:09:55.080
LAURA: Yeah, in the library.
MATT: Okay.

1637
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.170
As you're sketching it up,
one of the monks is like,

1638
01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:01.112
"I'm sorry, miss?"
LAURA: Huh?

1639
01:10:01.112 --> 01:10:03.200
MARISHA: They're with me.

1640
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.033
What?

1641
01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.770
LAURA: I'm not-- what?
MATT: "Nothing, continue."

1642
01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:07.945
And they shuffle-- (laughs)

1643
01:10:07.945 --> 01:10:09.603
TRAVIS: That's awesome.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1644
01:10:11.404 --> 01:10:13.970
MATT: You finish the spell,
you close your eyes,

1645
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:17.900
reach your consciousness
out to the Traveler,

1646
01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.960
to take you where it needs to be.

1647
01:10:26.018 --> 01:10:27.282
SAM: Hello.

1648
01:10:28.207 --> 01:10:29.895
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

1649
01:10:29.895 --> 01:10:30.797
Uh-oh.

1650
01:10:30.797 --> 01:10:32.260
SAM: Some rolling over there.

1651
01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.670
MATT: The Traveler-- you see
the sleeves emerge

1652
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:40.420
from the ether around you,
the imagery of the arms

1653
01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:45.180
touching and framing yours
like a papa bear

1654
01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.013
over the cub.

1655
01:10:46.013 --> 01:10:47.360
LAURA: Kind of like matching my tattoo?

1656
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.752
MATT: A little bit, yeah.

1657
01:10:49.855 --> 01:10:51.420
And as you do, you feel your consciousness

1658
01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.920
drift out of the library,

1659
01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.310
brought up into the clouds once more,

1660
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:59.690
rushed through the darkened, rain-bearing sky,

1661
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:02.180
until eventually you're
brought down rapidly

1662
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:05.740
through fog, and through
mists into the treetops.

1663
01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.460
You come through bramble forests,

1664
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.640
and dark, dangerous wood,

1665
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.570
and rocky, mountainside cliffs

1666
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:15.000
before you come to rest where
it seems like the interior

1667
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.660
of some sort of a house.

1668
01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.530
Small, dense, cluttered,
organized, in a way.

1669
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:22.630
Everything has its place,

1670
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:24.700
but it is very, very jam packed,

1671
01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:27.080
filled, and you see that the radius,

1672
01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.050
what looks like the outline
of many collected books,

1673
01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:34.960
papers, broken lanterns and pieces,

1674
01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.430
elements of animal bone.

1675
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:41.020
You can see a large collection

1676
01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.120
of jars and vials of things
that you can't quite make out

1677
01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.853
the details of what's inside.

1678
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:49.800
You see just in the corner,

1679
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.120
what looks to be a collection of stones

1680
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:58.610
that are arranged in a pattern,

1681
01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.590
and then, in the center of the chamber,

1682
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:03.665
you see a woman

1683
01:12:03.665 --> 01:12:06.781
wrapped in heavy tattered robes

1684
01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:10.200
with these long elements of gold trim rope

1685
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.290
wrapped around shoulder to side shoulder

1686
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:15.890
to side, holding it on in a very unique

1687
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:17.520
sort of ready to travel pattern.

1688
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:23.550
You see the familiar face of
her, currently looking down,

1689
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:26.891
and grasp some of these
arranged runes on the side.

1690
01:12:26.891 --> 01:12:29.483
LAURA: Are her arms long?
MATT: Her arms are long.

1691
01:12:29.483 --> 01:12:31.658
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: The fingers extending outward,

1692
01:12:31.658 --> 01:12:33.750
reminding you of Keona the Keen,

1693
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.160
but with a physicality that matches.

1694
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.930
SAM: Ooh. What is she?

1695
01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:41.640
MATT: The movement seems--
while you were debating

1696
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.610
the human aspect of her
with the visual element

1697
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:48.460
of the illusion, the physicality
of her definitely

1698
01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:52.863
scatters any idea of your
standard human soothsayer.

1699
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:57.010
Unable to really gauge size,
it's hard to tell,

1700
01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:59.235
but the movements themselves are...

1701
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.693
sweeping unnatural grace

1702
01:13:03.693 --> 01:13:06.620
to rapid grasps, and then, snatching,

1703
01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:09.590
as she takes some of these arranged runes

1704
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:11.520
and you can see, to the
ground in front of her,

1705
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.330
there are these unique sketches with

1706
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:16.430
charcoal of some kind,

1707
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:17.670
these small circles.

1708
01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:19.610
She takes the runes and
scatters them onto the ground.

1709
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:22.320
As they all scatter and then arrange,

1710
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.490
almost like there are magnets
holding them to place.

1711
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.220
LAURA: Do the runes look familiar to me at all?

1712
01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.740
MATT: They're just outside
of the range to make

1713
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.620
any detail, but you can see them hitting

1714
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.370
and scattering into place.
LAURA: Okay.

1715
01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:34.603
MATT: At which point, her eyes go--

1716
01:13:34.603 --> 01:13:35.619
LAURA: (gasps)

1717
01:13:37.039 --> 01:13:40.398
MATT: "Hello."
LAURA: Oh, shi-i-i-t.

1718
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:46.150
MATT: "Who's this I see?"

1719
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:51.060
LAURA: Um, Fiona Fancypants.
(laughter)

1720
01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.110
MATT: You can't converse through it.

1721
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:53.330
LAURA: Oh no.

1722
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:56.770
MATT: But she just slowly stands up,

1723
01:13:56.770 --> 01:14:01.768
very aware of the scrying, arcane bobble

1724
01:14:01.768 --> 01:14:04.880
that you've sent there,
and just puts the arms

1725
01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.240
almost like wrapping around it,

1726
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.588
and just goes--

1727
01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:13.622
"Oh, my curiosity is piqued.

1728
01:14:15.087 --> 01:14:18.334
"I hope this means I'm having visitors."

1729
01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:19.245
LAURA: (gasps)

1730
01:14:19.245 --> 01:14:21.110
And it slams out.
LAURA: (yelling)

1731
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:23.293
SAM: Are you okay? What happened?
LAURA: Oh my god.

1732
01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:25.872
She's so scary, she's so scary.

1733
01:14:27.127 --> 01:14:30.150
She knew I was there, she
knew I was scrying on her.

1734
01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:31.800
Oh my god.
SAM: Did she threaten you?

1735
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.850
Did she see you?

1736
01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:34.820
Did she know who you are?

1737
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:35.740
LAURA: I don't know.

1738
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.460
I don't know if she saw me,
I don't know if she saw

1739
01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.190
who I was, I don't know, I don't know.

1740
01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:41.150
She just said that she thought she was going

1741
01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:45.170
to have company, because she
saw that I was looking at her.

1742
01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:47.500
She had really long hands and long arms,

1743
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.235
and she's scary as fuck.

1744
01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:51.920
LIAM: There goes the element of surprise.

1745
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.080
LAURA: Oh my god.

1746
01:14:54.325 --> 01:14:55.770
Oh my god.
SAM: She must be very magical.

1747
01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:59.290
LAURA: Her face was so
close to my scrying eye.

1748
01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:00.667
It was so close.

1749
01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:05.360
TRAVIS: (laughs) Did you see up her nose?

1750
01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.380
LAURA: I mean, I saw hair coming out of it,

1751
01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.900
I saw a booger hanging on the side of her nostril.

1752
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.780
That's how close she was.

1753
01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.240
ASHLEY: Did she say anything?

1754
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.880
LAURA: She said, "What is this curiosity?"

1755
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.520
SAM: See, I told you she sounded like that.

1756
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.970
LAURA: Yes, she did.

1757
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:25.037
SAM: Can you disguise yourself
and make you look like her?

1758
01:15:25.037 --> 01:15:27.230
LAURA: Oh my god, I cast Disguise Self,

1759
01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:30.320
and I do it so everyone
can see how scary she was.

1760
01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.545
SAM: Ugh.
ASHLEY: Ah!

1761
01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:33.770
LAURA: And she was like this.

1762
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:35.178
SAM: Ugh, with the fingers?

1763
01:15:35.178 --> 01:15:36.969
LAURA: And then she would go like this.
And then like--

1764
01:15:36.969 --> 01:15:38.510
SAM: What is that?

1765
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:40.870
MATT: You can see the gnarled clumps of hair

1766
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.710
that drift out of the sides of the robe,

1767
01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:45.920
tangled and knotted into these large,

1768
01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.330
gathered rats' nests.

1769
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:51.088
LAURA: I walk up and start
dancing next to Fjord.

1770
01:15:53.109 --> 01:15:56.280
(hissing)
TRAVIS: Please no.

1771
01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.170
MATT: There are now four members
of the Cobalt Soul Library

1772
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:01.320
that are about 25 feet away, going--

1773
01:16:03.535 --> 01:16:04.851
LIAM: It's all right.
LAURA: What do you want?!

1774
01:16:04.851 --> 01:16:06.470
MATT: A few others are coming to join.

1775
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:07.880
LIAM: We are The Mighty Nein.

1776
01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.530
TRAVIS: Beauregard, can we get
bottle service over here?

1777
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:12.746
What's wrong with you? Are you okay?

1778
01:16:12.746 --> 01:16:13.854
MARISHA: I'm okay.

1779
01:16:13.854 --> 01:16:16.350
TRAVIS: Does that ring any bells, that visage?

1780
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:17.910
SAM: Wait, have you seen this person?

1781
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:19.410
MARISHA: No.
SAM: Okay.

1782
01:16:20.436 --> 01:16:23.200
ASHLEY: Does this look like--
this looks like the woman, yeah?

1783
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.117
LAURA: Am I traumatizing you, Nott,
you want me to drop it?

1784
01:16:26.117 --> 01:16:28.390
SAM: No, I mean, I just looked
like her a second ago.

1785
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:29.350
LAURA: That's true.
SAM: So it's fine.

1786
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:31.210
LAURA: But then you can't see
that part, you know what I mean?

1787
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:32.745
SAM: That's true.

1788
01:16:32.745 --> 01:16:33.790
No, it's fine.

1789
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.650
You do look super creepy, though.

1790
01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:38.530
ASHLEY: Wait, you said she was laughing at you--?

1791
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:41.050
SAM: She was laughing, yes, and--

1792
01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:42.210
LAURA: I drop it. (laughs)

1793
01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:46.112
SAM: She seemed delighted that
whatever she did to me worked

1794
01:16:47.282 --> 01:16:50.977
and that she'd created something horrifying.

1795
01:16:50.977 --> 01:16:52.268
TRAVIS: You said you were hoping, what?

1796
01:16:52.268 --> 01:16:54.360
SAM: Why, do you know something
about her, as well?

1797
01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.077
ASHLEY: No. I was just going to se if maybe--

1798
01:16:56.077 --> 01:16:57.660
SAM: Because everyone seems to
be connected all of a sudden.

1799
01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.730
LAURA: Oh, man, she's really smart.

1800
01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.760
What if she connects the
dots that it's you,

1801
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.240
that it's something about
you that was scrying on her,

1802
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.970
because you know, she just laughed--

1803
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:06.810
SAM: How would she do that? What?
LAURA: Because she just laughed

1804
01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:07.830
in your head, you know?

1805
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:09.940
SAM: But that could've
been from ages ago.

1806
01:17:11.225 --> 01:17:13.692
LAURA: That's true. But maybe she
gets senses when it happens,

1807
01:17:13.692 --> 01:17:15.082
because she's really powerful.

1808
01:17:15.082 --> 01:17:17.370
MARISHA: Let's go get some drinks.

1809
01:17:17.370 --> 01:17:20.085
SAM: Oh, that's not a bad idea.

1810
01:17:20.085 --> 01:17:21.920
TRAVIS: Are we done looking up everything?

1811
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.380
MARISHA: I think so.

1812
01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.390
TRAVIS: Let's go.

1813
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:27.101
MARISHA: I have checked out all of
the information on where to find--

1814
01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:28.451
LAURA: I draw--

1815
01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.200
MATT: Okay, yeah, it's

1816
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.067
Cyrios Mountain Woods,
north of the Bromkiln Hills.

1817
01:17:34.067 --> 01:17:37.367
LAURA: Some Kama Sutra within the
Cobalt Soul books before we leave.

1818
01:17:37.367 --> 01:17:39.170
MATT: Roughly.
LAURA: Okay, goodbye.

1819
01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:41.040
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: It's canon.

1820
01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:43.770
She drew something in some books.

1821
01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:44.603
MATT: Mm.

1822
01:17:45.596 --> 01:17:47.303
Make a sleight of hand check.

1823
01:17:47.303 --> 01:17:48.378
LAURA: Give me Guidance--
TRAVIS: Really?

1824
01:17:48.378 --> 01:17:49.800
LAURA: Guide me.
TALIESIN: Not for this.

1825
01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.544
LAURA: I'm going to guide myself!
SAM: Guidance.

1826
01:17:51.544 --> 01:17:54.461
(laughter)

1827
01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:57.310
LAURA: ♪ Sleight of hand ♪

1828
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:59.340
19.
MATT: 19?

1829
01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:02.290
LAURA: Oh, wait, I got a d4, too.

1830
01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:05.466
Hold on, hold on, I guided myself.

1831
01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.700
TALIESIN: I'll remind you to guide it,
but I'm not going to guide it for you.

1832
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:10.970
LAURA: Ah, 20.
MATT: 20, okay.

1833
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:14.170
You proceed to leave a series--

1834
01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:17.390
LAURA: ♪ Churning the butter ♪
(Matt laughing)

1835
01:18:19.673 --> 01:18:22.010
TALIESIN: Call back.
MATT: And as tightly watched

1836
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:23.980
as you are, Beau's presence leaves them

1837
01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.500
a little more comfortable about the fact

1838
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.000
that they're not having to
look over your shoulder

1839
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.488
for the research you're doing.

1840
01:18:29.488 --> 01:18:31.690
You manage to leave a
few of these sketches

1841
01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:33.170
within the books you find, and put them away

1842
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:34.500
without being called on it.

1843
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.060
You're uncertain if you've been noticed,

1844
01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.530
but you certainly weren't called out

1845
01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:40.720
or publicly punished for it.

1846
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.553
LAURA: Nice.

1847
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:43.950
SAM: We're going to go get a drink.

1848
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:45.650
Are we staying in Beau's house tonight?

1849
01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:49.220
Or are we going to stay at dad's place?

1850
01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.730
TALIESIN: Dad's is a bit of a ways off.

1851
01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:52.420
LIAM: Yeah, we're in Zadash.

1852
01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.390
We probably need to find a place to stay
for the evening, and set out in the morning.

1853
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:56.850
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Beau's house was the plan.

1854
01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:59.030
LAURA: Beau's house is--
TRAVIS: I mean, Beau's place.

1855
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:00.710
MARISHA: They're talking about The Gentleman.

1856
01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:03.260
LAURA: The Gentleman, my mama, my dad.

1857
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.110
SAM: Yeah, the Evening Nip, The Gentleman.

1858
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:07.290
LAURA: We've got a room there, too, you know?

1859
01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:08.450
Wherever we want to go.

1860
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:11.590
Maybe we see where we'll end up after we drink.

1861
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:13.792
But Beau's room is nicer.

1862
01:19:15.648 --> 01:19:19.910
SAM: But the Gentleman's house
is your dad, right?

1863
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:20.840
LAURA: Yup.

1864
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.682
LIAM: Dads is the theme of the day.
LAURA: That is my dad.

1865
01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.670
TRAVIS: Should we go get drinks
at the Leaky Nip and then--

1866
01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:30.470
SAM: (laughs) It's the Evening Nip.

1867
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.980
TRAVIS: And then see if--

1868
01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.902
MARISHA: Have you told us that before?
LAURA: What?

1869
01:19:34.902 --> 01:19:37.173
MARISHA: Have you told us that dad bit?

1870
01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:38.915
SAM: I mean, we suspected it, right?

1871
01:19:38.915 --> 01:19:40.850
MARISHA: Do we have confirmation?

1872
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:41.932
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1873
01:19:41.932 --> 01:19:44.030
I mean, I'm assuming that I told you.

1874
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.350
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

1875
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:46.838
LAURA: We're roommates after all.

1876
01:19:46.838 --> 01:19:48.310
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: This is Jester and Marisha.

1877
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:50.530
LAURA: Yeah.
(laughter)

1878
01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:52.960
But yeah, you guys, he totally,
definitely told me,

1879
01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.140
he's definitely, totally my dad.

1880
01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:59.140
Yasha, my dad is The Gentleman.

1881
01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:02.310
ASHLEY: The, the--
LAURA: The blue guy?

1882
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:03.980
Remember, he's blue?

1883
01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:06.430
ASHLEY: The moist--?
LAURA: He's-- yeah, it's-- yeah.

1884
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:07.550
SAM: Tall drink of water.

1885
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:09.823
MARISHA: Who has all of our blood on file.

1886
01:20:09.823 --> 01:20:11.760
LAURA: Yeah, but now we know he's going to be cool about it,

1887
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.593
because he's my dad.

1888
01:20:12.593 --> 01:20:14.790
He's not going to do anything fucked up, you know?

1889
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:16.032
ASHLEY: That's really cool.

1890
01:20:16.032 --> 01:20:18.350
He seemed really cool.
TALIESIN: Uh.

1891
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:19.183
LAURA: He is.

1892
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.790
ASHLEY: I really, I liked him, I feel weird

1893
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:27.110
that he has some of my blood, but I really like him.

1894
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:29.160
I think it's very cool that you found your dad.

1895
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.940
TALIESIN: I feel like the moral of the last couple of months

1896
01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.630
is, "Dads can do some messed up things."

1897
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:34.038
I don't know if,

1898
01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:36.680
"He's my dad, he's not going to do anything uncool"

1899
01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.810
is really the moral we're supposed to walk away with.

1900
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:40.810
LAURA: I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

1901
01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:41.643
TALIESIN: Okay.

1902
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:44.880
SAM: Well, we have options.

1903
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.660
We can go to the Leaky Tap,

1904
01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.340
we can go to the Evening Nip,

1905
01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:50.040
we can go the Song and Supper Inn.

1906
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.350
It's a karaoke bar.

1907
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:52.886
We can go up to the Pillow Trove.

1908
01:20:52.886 --> 01:20:54.050
(laughter)

1909
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:58.320
We can go to Chastity's Nook porn shop.

1910
01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.190
We can go to--
LAURA: Always a solid option.

1911
01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:01.330
TALIESIN: Karaoke bar that only has public--

1912
01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:03.030
SAM: Pumat Sol's.

1913
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:05.060
LAURA: Did we have anything, is he making us anything?

1914
01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:05.893
TRAVIS: Nope.

1915
01:21:05.893 --> 01:21:07.363
ASHLEY: There's a porn shop?

1916
01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.430
TRAVIS: No, no. It wasn't really porn,

1917
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:11.346
it was more like cheap--
LAURA: That's where we got

1918
01:21:11.346 --> 01:21:13.507
Tusk Love, Yasha.

1919
01:21:13.507 --> 01:21:14.570
LIAM: Does anybody got a Player's Handbook?

1920
01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:17.050
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

1921
01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:19.165
LIAM: Here's one right there. I'll take that one, though.

1922
01:21:19.165 --> 01:21:21.200
SAM: Are we going to go to the karaoke place?

1923
01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.040
MARISHA: No, it's too loud at the karaoke place.

1924
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.706
TRAVIS: Let's go to The Gentleman's.
MARISHA: People sing.

1925
01:21:25.706 --> 01:21:27.190
LAURA: Yeah, let's go to--
SAM: What's wrong with singing?

1926
01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:28.340
Singing's nice.

1927
01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.600
MARISHA: When people do karaoke, they try too hard.

1928
01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:33.860
SAM: No, you have your song that you go,

1929
01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.940
you have a song that you always sing,

1930
01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:37.140
and you're good at it.
ASHLEY: Do you have a song

1931
01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.010
that you always sing?

1932
01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:38.843
LAURA: What do you sing?

1933
01:21:38.843 --> 01:21:40.170
SAM: Sweet Caroline.

1934
01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:41.670
ASHLEY: How does it go?

1935
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.090
SAM: Well, it's in--
(laughter)

1936
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:47.410
It's in Abyssal.
(laughter)

1937
01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:49.280
ASHLEY: I happen to speak Abyssal,

1938
01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.260
so I'll know exactly what you're singing.

1939
01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:56.227
(laughter)

1940
01:21:58.822 --> 01:22:01.242
SAM: (clears throat) It goes like this.

1941
01:22:02.463 --> 01:22:05.830
(to the tune of Sweet Caroline) ♪ Nach, whoa nehha ♪

1942
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:07.707
ALL BUT SAM: ♪ Bum, bum, bum ♪

1943
01:22:07.707 --> 01:22:10.940
SAM: ♪ No hha la ma whoa ne leia. ♪

1944
01:22:11.896 --> 01:22:14.254
♪ Mich hha me ka ♪

1945
01:22:14.254 --> 01:22:16.210
ALL BUT SAM: ♪ Bah, bah, bah ♪

1946
01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:19.596
SAM: ♪ Mo hhach Caroline me hhuh ♪

1947
01:22:19.596 --> 01:22:20.820
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Ow!

1948
01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.253
ASHLEY: Wow.

1949
01:22:23.253 --> 01:22:26.730
I feel like a lot of those,

1950
01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:29.667
you said, you had sentences that sometimes

1951
01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:32.640
didn't make sense.
(laughter)

1952
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.210
SAM: I learned it, like, third hand,

1953
01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:37.293
and I think, all the people, you know,

1954
01:22:37.293 --> 01:22:39.660
they had a selection of songs,

1955
01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.050
and some of them were in Abyssal.

1956
01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:43.891
I think they got their book from an Abyssal karaoke bar?

1957
01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:45.290
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1958
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:46.450
SAM: Or something, and so--
LAURA: That's weird

1959
01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:47.800
that that's your go to, though.

1960
01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.690
SAM: Well, I mean, nobody sang those songs,

1961
01:22:49.690 --> 01:22:51.960
so I felt like those were more open game.

1962
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.660
Everyone kept singing the same songs all the time.

1963
01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.580
ASHLEY: Yeah, because you said something like,

1964
01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:00.610
"Good times never felt so flute."

1965
01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:04.555
It was like wrong--
TALIESIN: Conjugation.

1966
01:23:04.555 --> 01:23:05.580
ASHLEY: Well, no, I think it's,

1967
01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:08.030
"Good times never felt so good," I think.

1968
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:09.070
TALIESIN: That makes a lot more sense.

1969
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:10.190
SAM: That doesn't make any sense.

1970
01:23:10.190 --> 01:23:11.790
"Good times never felt so <i>good</i>?"

1971
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:13.350
ASHLEY: What's the lyrics?
SAM: Stupid lyrics.

1972
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:14.183
MARISHA: Some lazy songwriting.

1973
01:23:14.183 --> 01:23:16.950
ASHLEY: ♪ Good times never felt so good ♪

1974
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:17.950
MARISHA: ♪ Bah blah blah ♪
SAM: That's stupid.

1975
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:19.940
I think it's flute.
MATT: This--

1976
01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:22.407
TALIESIN: Good times never felt so flute.

1977
01:23:23.902 --> 01:23:24.930
LIAM: What the shit is going on?

1978
01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:28.730
LAURA: So karaoke or Leaky Nip?

1979
01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:30.300
MARISHA and LIAM: Leaky Nip.

1980
01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:31.940
ASHLEY: Yeah, we already got some music from--

1981
01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:35.040
MATT: There's the Leaky Tap and there's the Evening Nip.

1982
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.580
Where you going? (laughs)

1983
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.530
TRAVIS: The Evening Nip.

1984
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:41.340
:IAM: We open our own pub called
The Leaky Nip in between the two places.

1985
01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:42.610
LAURA: We're going to The Gentleman's.

1986
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:44.967
MARISHA: I'm kind of into this.
MATT: Okay.

1987
01:23:44.967 --> 01:23:45.800
All righty.

1988
01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:49.597
MARISHA: We should save money for this. It's a good idea.

1989
01:23:49.597 --> 01:23:50.430
MATT: All righty.

1990
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:52.057
LIAM: Both businesses hate us.

1991
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:57.170
MATT: So you make your way to the familiar dive bar

1992
01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:59.883
that is The Evening Nip.

1993
01:23:59.883 --> 01:24:01.340
You remember the needed password,

1994
01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:04.110
and are let down within the subterranean bar.

1995
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:05.680
It's a bit empty at the moment.

1996
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:08.950
At this point, not entire sure whether people are busy

1997
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:11.220
or have other business to take care of.

1998
01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:12.690
The Gentleman is not immediately in the bar,

1999
01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.110
but you are recognized upon arrival,

2000
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:17.640
and are allowed your use of the space.

2001
01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.119
There is a bartender there who's in the process

2002
01:24:19.119 --> 01:24:21.100
of half-sleeping in the corner,

2003
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.140
that as soon as you approach,

2004
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:26.580
and speak with the familiar ogre bodyguard

2005
01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:29.520
at the interior, he's like, "(grunting)

2006
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.520
"All right," lets you in.

2007
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.560
The bartender shoots up and "Can I get you drinks?"

2008
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:38.226
LAURA: Yeah, my dad said give us whatever we want.

2009
01:24:38.226 --> 01:24:42.890
SAM: (laughs) Oh, she's a loud and crazy guy.

2010
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:44.670
MATT: "What would you want then?"

2011
01:24:44.670 --> 01:24:45.720
LAURA: Whatever they want.

2012
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.760
MARISHA and SAM: Whiskey.

2013
01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.103
MATT: "Whiskey all round.

2014
01:24:50.103 --> 01:24:51.544
TALIESIN: Juice.
LAURA: Milk!

2015
01:24:51.544 --> 01:24:53.120
MATT: "Whiskey juice."

2016
01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.175
LAURA: Milk.

2017
01:24:55.175 --> 01:24:58.130
MARISHA: I really hope he brings you a whiskey juice.

2018
01:24:58.130 --> 01:25:00.890
TALIESIN: What's a whiskey juice?
MARISHA: Exactly.

2019
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:03.990
MATT: He brings around--
ASHLEY: He brings a whiskey juice?

2020
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:06.480
MATT: A shot of whiskey, a shot of whiskey,
a shot of whiskey,

2021
01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.248
a shot of whiskey, milk, juice, whiskey.

2022
01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:12.620
SAM: All right, bottoms up.

2023
01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:17.470
MATT: That is a very, very terrible tasting, strong,

2024
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:20.730
pungent juice, very strong bite to it.

2025
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:22.530
TALIESIN: I got something for this, hold on.

2026
01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.740
MATT: Same with the milk.

2027
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.313
That's a whiskey milk.

2028
01:25:27.313 --> 01:25:29.480
SAM: Ooh.

2029
01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.510
LAURA: That's a whiskey milk.

2030
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:32.343
TALIESIN: I'm going to put a little--

2031
01:25:32.343 --> 01:25:34.009
MATT: Partially curdled.
TALIESIN: Just a tiny bit of that

2032
01:25:34.009 --> 01:25:35.240
I've saving some of that--

2033
01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.581
SAM: Put some whipped cream on it.
TALIESIN: -- hallucinogenic fruit

2034
01:25:37.581 --> 01:25:39.613
that I've now preserved as best I can.

2035
01:25:39.613 --> 01:25:41.310
I'm just going to use it like nutmeg,

2036
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:42.570
and see if I can fix this.

2037
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:43.403
LAURA: Put some in here, too.

2038
01:25:43.403 --> 01:25:44.828
TALIESIN: Okay, there we go.

2039
01:25:44.828 --> 01:25:46.180
MATT: Okay.

2040
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:47.013
TRAVIS: Upgrading this night.

2041
01:25:47.013 --> 01:25:48.756
MARISHA: Are you making a White Xhorhasian again?

2042
01:25:48.756 --> 01:25:52.120
MATT: (laughs) It helps with the sting of the flavor.

2043
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.445
LIAM: Oh, I love that.

2044
01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.310
MATT: Yeah.

2045
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:58.020
So you enjoy some drinks,

2046
01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.880
you have a space, you know,

2047
01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.750
to relax for a bit.

2048
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:03.180
SAM: Going to ask around for your pops or no?

2049
01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.590
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to go find
my dad's office, go say hello.

2050
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:07.640
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

2051
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.973
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Disguise Self

2052
01:26:08.973 --> 01:26:10.367
to still look just like me,

2053
01:26:10.367 --> 01:26:13.007
except Fjord in my clothes with my hair.

2054
01:26:13.007 --> 01:26:16.150
SAM: I knew it.
(laughter)

2055
01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:19.700
TALIESIN: Just trying to be off in the periphery,

2056
01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:20.675
sitting next to you.

2057
01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:22.230
TRAVIS: But you're super tall now.

2058
01:26:22.230 --> 01:26:24.430
TALIESIN: No, I can actually--
TRAVIS: Oh.

2059
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:25.610
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can do that.

2060
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:28.260
ASHLEY: Jester, have you ever had alcohol before?

2061
01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:29.202
LAURA: Yes.
ASHLEY: You have?

2062
01:26:29.202 --> 01:26:30.035
LAURA: Yeah.

2063
01:26:30.035 --> 01:26:31.976
SAM: But not many times.

2064
01:26:31.976 --> 01:26:33.420
ASHLEY: Not many times.

2065
01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:35.350
LAURA: I didn't down my milk, you can have my milk,

2066
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:36.900
whiskey milk if you want to.

2067
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.380
ASHLEY: I feel like-- I...okay.

2068
01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.690
LAURA: It's got some lumps in it.

2069
01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:42.550
That's, you know.

2070
01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.840
TALIESIN: Oh, it would curdle.

2071
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:45.990
LIAM: Those are the good parts.

2072
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:47.515
MATT: Yeah, it'd curdle.
TALIESIN: It'd curdle, oh.

2073
01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.380
MATT: It's chewy.
(groaning)

2074
01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.580
ASHLEY: Interesting taste.
TALIESIN: It's got chunks.

2075
01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.870
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel like I would just get the whiskey

2076
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:56.045
next time, maybe.

2077
01:26:56.045 --> 01:26:57.488
LAURA: Yeah.

2078
01:26:57.488 --> 01:26:58.530
MATT: You're starting to feel a little funny.

2079
01:26:58.530 --> 01:26:59.840
TALIESIN: That is, yeah.

2080
01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:04.150
Hello, I'm Fjord.
SAM and LAURA: (gasping)

2081
01:27:04.150 --> 01:27:05.270
TALIESIN: Try it, wait, wait.

2082
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:08.160
LIAM: You're so good with accents.
TALIESIN: (somewhat British accent) Hello, I'm Fjord.

2083
01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.860
Yeah, it's--
TRAVIS: Are you being old Fjord

2084
01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:12.290
or current Fjord?

2085
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:14.310
TALIESIN: Trying to do your accent.

2086
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:16.306
It's--

2087
01:27:16.306 --> 01:27:18.189
Hello, all.

2088
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:19.497
TRAVIS: That's very close.

2089
01:27:19.497 --> 01:27:20.850
SAM: That's pretty good.
TRAVIS: That's not bad, yeah.

2090
01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:22.090
SAM: Say this, say this:

2091
01:27:22.090 --> 01:27:24.770
I don't know, I can't remember.

2092
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:26.940
TALIESIN: I don't know, I can't remember.

2093
01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:29.210
SAM: It's just like him.
TRAVIS: No, I can't remember.

2094
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.120
TALIESIN: I cahn't, I cahn't remember?

2095
01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.670
LIAM: Hit us with a Eldritch Blast.

2096
01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:39.410
TALIESIN: Eldritch Blast! Ooh, that's hard to say.

2097
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:40.760
Blast, blast.
TRAVIS: You got caught up

2098
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:41.936
in the moment, and you got to, like,

2099
01:27:41.936 --> 01:27:44.360
just, Eldritch Blast.
TALIESIN: It's really cool

2100
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.420
when you do that, though.

2101
01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:47.130
It is-- you know, you know,

2102
01:27:47.130 --> 01:27:48.640
it's pretty cool when you do that.

2103
01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.150
MATT: As you come to the office door--

2104
01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:50.983
LAURA: Dad!

2105
01:27:50.983 --> 01:27:53.165
Dad! Dad, it's me.

2106
01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.440
MATT: "Yes?"

2107
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.070
LAURA: Dad, it's Jester, I'm here to say hi.

2108
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.226
MATT: "Open the door."
LAURA: Okay.

2109
01:28:00.226 --> 01:28:01.580
Hi.

2110
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:04.280
MATT: As you walk inside his office, you can see

2111
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.410
his desk currently is strewn with some papers,

2112
01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:09.570
and he's putting something away,

2113
01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:12.660
and turning in his chair toward you.

2114
01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:14.920
"Ah, I had no idea you'd be joining me."

2115
01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.330
LAURA: Well, I didn't either.

2116
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:18.900
We just found out.

2117
01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.410
MATT: "Well, welcome.

2118
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.960
"Are your friends here as well?"

2119
01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.480
LAURA: They are, they're drinking.

2120
01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.280
I told them it's on the house.

2121
01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.890
MATT: "Sure."
(laughter)

2122
01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:34.270
LAURA: So what have you been up to?

2123
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.633
MATT: "Business.

2124
01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.900
"What have you been up to?"

2125
01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.250
LAURA: Oh my god, you don't-- I tell him everything.

2126
01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.520
Just like launch into the whole thing.

2127
01:28:46.031 --> 01:28:48.290
MATT: As it progresses, he leans further

2128
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:49.440
and further back in his chair,

2129
01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.670
until he hits the back of the chair.

2130
01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:53.780
LAURA: Yeah, so anyway, we got to find this weird,

2131
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.810
creepy lady who totally saw me scrying on her.

2132
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:58.310
We got to find out what the deal with it is,

2133
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:59.443
so we can break the curse,

2134
01:28:59.443 --> 01:29:01.745
then we got to to go to the negotiations,

2135
01:29:01.745 --> 01:29:04.100
then Traveler Con, and somewhere,

2136
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.187
we're fitting into that Clay's family stuff.

2137
01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:14.300
MATT: "One of these days, I'm going to have to teach you

2138
01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.420
"something I've learned at a very young age,

2139
01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:21.183
"which is how to not have to do everything yourself.

2140
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:23.850
"It's much easier."

2141
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:25.553
LAURA: Okay, I'm okay with that.

2142
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:28.060
Teach me your ways.

2143
01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:31.040
MATT: "In time."
LAURA: Have you called Mom?

2144
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.800
Have you sent her a letter?

2145
01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.650
Have you gone to see her?

2146
01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:37.240
Have you been like, "Oh my gosh, I miss you?"

2147
01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.090
MATT: "No, there's been a lot to take care of here.

2148
01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.080
"There's, in the midst of

2149
01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.170
"conflict, if done right, in the Empire,

2150
01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:48.520
"can be a very profitable endeavor.

2151
01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.845
"But one has to be very on top of their

2152
01:29:53.719 --> 01:29:54.994
"organization

2153
01:29:54.994 --> 01:29:57.069
"to maintain it.

2154
01:29:57.069 --> 01:30:00.285
"So I've been working a lot."

2155
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:02.845
LAURA: Will you make me-- well,

2156
01:30:04.024 --> 01:30:05.174
will you do me a favor?

2157
01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.300
MATT: "Possibly."

2158
01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.430
LAURA: If, by any chance, when people offer you things

2159
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:15.780
or whatever, you come across smuggled items

2160
01:30:16.890 --> 01:30:20.240
that resemble the beacons that I told you about--

2161
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:22.600
MATT: "Right, right."

2162
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.880
LAURA: If you come across anything like that,

2163
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.030
will you let me know before you try to sell it

2164
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:28.230
to another person?

2165
01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:33.200
MATT: "For you, yes."

2166
01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:34.033
LAURA: Thank you.

2167
01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.370
I'll send you messages every once in a while

2168
01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:40.970
just so you can get it to me, if you, you know.

2169
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:42.450
Because we travel around a lot.

2170
01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:43.950
You won't know where I am, so.

2171
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:46.430
MATT: "Of course."
LAURA: Okay.

2172
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:51.700
MATT: "If I don't respond, don't take it personally.

2173
01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.437
"I might be indisposed."

2174
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.473
LAURA: Like how?

2175
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:58.170
MATT: "Many things."

2176
01:30:58.170 --> 01:30:59.750
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, here's the thing.

2177
01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:01.200
What if I send you a message,

2178
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:05.560
and you should have a way to communicate with me

2179
01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.590
that you're indisposed,

2180
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:09.420
like so I can know that you're not just in trouble

2181
01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:13.050
but you're boning somebody, or you're in a meeting

2182
01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:15.958
or something, you could be like "(squeaks)",

2183
01:31:15.958 --> 01:31:17.241
or you could be like--

2184
01:31:17.241 --> 01:31:19.510
what if you just cough when I send,

2185
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:21.440
or you say like--

2186
01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:24.430
MATT: "A cough, a cough will do well."
LAURA: Okay.

2187
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:25.510
MATT: "I'll cough,

2188
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:28.120
"and we'll pick it up another time."

2189
01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.470
LAURA: All right, all right, all right.

2190
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:31.820
Look at us, we have a code.

2191
01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.280
Can I sleep in the room tonight that you said we could have?

2192
01:31:38.610 --> 01:31:41.120
MATT: "Sure, sure."

2193
01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.970
LAURA: Thank you, Dad.
MATT: "I'll arrange it."

2194
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.480
He laughs in spite of himself.

2195
01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.900
You can see him trying to organize being in a deep

2196
01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:54.050
moment of thought and the whirlwind of chaos

2197
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:56.390
that is Jester just blowing in like a storm,

2198
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:59.130
and in spite of his momentary frustration,

2199
01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:00.680
he can't help but crack a smile.

2200
01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:05.382
"Well, say hello to your friends for me."

2201
01:32:05.382 --> 01:32:06.223
LAURA: Okay.

2202
01:32:06.223 --> 01:32:07.650
MATT: "Close the door on your way out."

2203
01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:09.570
LAURA: I will.

2204
01:32:12.616 --> 01:32:13.900
We have a room!

2205
01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.140
TALIESIN: So do you have to say Eldritch Blast every time,

2206
01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.310
or is that part of the spell, or do you just do it

2207
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:20.490
because it's just, like-- I've always wondered.

2208
01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:23.461
TRAVIS: Showmanship, right?

2209
01:32:23.461 --> 01:32:26.740
TALIESIN: So it's like going whoosh, when you're--

2210
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:27.890
TRAVIS: It's also like, "stay clear,

2211
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:29.365
"because shit's about to go down."

2212
01:32:29.365 --> 01:32:32.253
TALIESIN: Oh, so it's also for us.
ASHLEY: (slurred southern drawl) Eldritch Blast.

2213
01:32:32.253 --> 01:32:34.263
TRAVIS: You could try it for other things.
TALIESIN: THat's really good.

2214
01:32:34.263 --> 01:32:36.410
TRAVIS: You could say, "Magician's Judge,"

2215
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:38.000
and be really like, judge!

2216
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.770
ASHLEY: I'm going to hit you.

2217
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:41.800
TRAVIS: A little, maybe work that phrase more.

2218
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.050
It's kind of ordinary.

2219
01:32:43.050 --> 01:32:44.140
ASHLEY: I'm going to kill you.

2220
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.270
TALIESIN: I'm going to heal you.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2221
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:47.370
LAURA: Ooh, that's good, too.
TALIESIN: I like it.

2222
01:32:47.370 --> 01:32:49.390
ASHLEY: Here it comes!
TALIESIN: You're okay!

2223
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:51.750
LIAM: Sometimes, though, it's also good not to telegraph

2224
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:53.360
what you're about to do before you do it,

2225
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.960
because then you surprise them more.

2226
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.380
TALIESIN: What if you go, "I'm going to heal you,"

2227
01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:58.170
and then you Magician's Judge them?

2228
01:32:58.170 --> 01:33:00.110
TRAVIS: Or branding's very important, so maybe instead of,

2229
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:03.200
"I'm going to hit you," "I'm going to judge you"?

2230
01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.640
LAURA: Ooh.
ASHLEY: Oh, wow.

2231
01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.290
LAURA: You have been judged!
ASHLEY: Oh, that's good.

2232
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:09.670
LAURA: That's good, that's after you've killed him.

2233
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:11.960
TRAVIS: And the jury's going to deliberate.

2234
01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.793
TALIESIN: That's good.

2235
01:33:12.793 --> 01:33:14.030
SAM: And Caduceus could be like,

2236
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:16.900
"I'm going to drop a deuce on you."

2237
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.733
LAURA: Ooh.

2238
01:33:17.733 --> 01:33:20.230
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the deuce.
SAM: Yep.

2239
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:22.880
ASHLEY: Wait, Jester, how did it go with your dad?

2240
01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.590
LAURA: Oh my god, you guys, he loves me so much.

2241
01:33:26.678 --> 01:33:27.769
SAM: Of course he does.

2242
01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.096
What's there not to love?
TALIESIN: What's not to love?

2243
01:33:30.096 --> 01:33:32.330
LAURA: (laughs) He said we could have a room,

2244
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:34.840
he said that we could have free drinks,

2245
01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.870
he said that if he runs across any beacons,

2246
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:39.703
he'll let us know.

2247
01:33:39.703 --> 01:33:41.831
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice.
SAM: That's great.

2248
01:33:41.831 --> 01:33:45.140
Did you happen to ask him about any magical women

2249
01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:46.590
hidden in the woods or anything?

2250
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:48.130
LAURA: No, I mean, we already know--

2251
01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:49.350
SAM: Okay, okay.
LAURA: What exactly

2252
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:51.470
we're looking for here.
SAM: Maybe he's interacted

2253
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:52.453
with her in the past.

2254
01:33:52.453 --> 01:33:53.720
LAURA: Oh my god.

2255
01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.170
TRAVIS: I'll pick up my drink
and head over to where Beau is.

2256
01:33:57.170 --> 01:33:58.003
MATT: Mm.

2257
01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:01.748
TRAVIS: How are you doing?

2258
01:34:05.201 --> 01:34:06.226
MARISHA: I'm great.

2259
01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:11.480
TRAVIS: Your histamine reactions are going again.

2260
01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:14.382
MARISHA: Yeah.

2261
01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:16.010
I've been away from Zadash for a little bit,

2262
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:18.670
so the pollen, it's kicking a little, you know?

2263
01:34:20.981 --> 01:34:25.223
TRAVIS: I take it you don't fully, fully hate your dad.

2264
01:34:27.243 --> 01:34:29.993
It's got to be hard to hear this.

2265
01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.340
MARISHA: Everyone wants to make their dad proud, you know?

2266
01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:46.123
Just hoping he could,

2267
01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.710
he could show some of that.

2268
01:34:58.093 --> 01:34:59.570
TRAVIS: You don't know that he can't.

2269
01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.040
It's been years.

2270
01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:05.580
You've grown, you've changed.

2271
01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:10.970
I'm sure you were even more of an unbearable shit before.

2272
01:35:15.693 --> 01:35:17.870
I'm not saying he deserves a second chance, but

2273
01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:23.010
he is your father, and you do have a mother,

2274
01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:24.810
and a brother that you've never met.

2275
01:35:28.531 --> 01:35:31.198
MARISHA: (sniffs)

2276
01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:37.734
I guess it's hard when...

2277
01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:47.300
the word inevitable has been brought up several times

2278
01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.150
in the past 24 hours amongst us.

2279
01:35:53.673 --> 01:35:57.286
I feel like I've found my family with The Mighty Nein.

2280
01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.000
I don't like looking at my past,

2281
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.550
because it doesn't have The Mighty Nein in it,

2282
01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:10.740
and I think I put off the inevitable,

2283
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.931
because I'm going to--

2284
01:36:16.931 --> 01:36:18.789
I'm afraid it's going to be like my past.

2285
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:27.440
TRAVIS: I don't think one contaminates the other.

2286
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:32.918
You've got good, solid footing here.

2287
01:36:35.429 --> 01:36:37.730
I mean, shit, if we want to run, we run.

2288
01:36:37.730 --> 01:36:40.310
If we want to kick his ass, we'll kick his ass.

2289
01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.518
MARISHA: Yeah. (sniffing)

2290
01:36:44.518 --> 01:36:45.943
I kind of want to kick his ass,

2291
01:36:48.557 --> 01:36:49.657
and I don't want to run.

2292
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:56.770
TRAVIS: Could I ask you, in your wildest dreams,

2293
01:36:56.770 --> 01:36:59.420
and feel free to say you don't want to tell me,

2294
01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.119
what would you have happen when we go there?

2295
01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:13.920
MARISHA: I think I've worked so hard

2296
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:20.630
because I scripted this day,

2297
01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:29.170
in my inevitable future that I would go back to him,

2298
01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:34.960
successful woman, respectable member of society,

2299
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.523
Cobalt Soul, an Expositor,

2300
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:44.687
the thing he threw me away to, and I embraced.

2301
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:52.180
And then, I would get mad at myself,

2302
01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.380
because I felt like I was doing exactly

2303
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:58.560
what he was doing to me my entire life,

2304
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.460
scripting me to be something else.

2305
01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:08.699
And I'm still <i>doing it</i>.

2306
01:38:11.809 --> 01:38:13.530
I haven't seen him in three years,

2307
01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:15.907
and I'm still trying to be...

2308
01:38:19.166 --> 01:38:20.699
something.

2309
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:25.597
And I think what's scary is that I

2310
01:38:27.456 --> 01:38:29.931
like this, and what I've found,

2311
01:38:29.931 --> 01:38:31.770
and I don't think it was until

2312
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:37.963
Nott started talking about

2313
01:38:38.863 --> 01:38:40.379
having to go home

2314
01:38:40.379 --> 01:38:44.860
and go away that it truly started terrifying me.

2315
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:54.035
Because for the first time, I'm happy.

2316
01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.190
And what if that goes away?

2317
01:39:03.009 --> 01:39:04.190
TRAVIS: It could always go away.

2318
01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:06.321
It could go away tonight.

2319
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.618
The Gentleman's debtors could come calling.

2320
01:39:09.618 --> 01:39:12.379
MARISHA: (chuckling)

2321
01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:13.860
And I think I know that,

2322
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:17.720
and I think I say things to Nott like,

2323
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:22.980
"You don't have to put those stipulations on yourself"

2324
01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.850
because I've convinced myself that

2325
01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.600
destiny or the inevitability won't come knocking.

2326
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:37.703
If you ignore it, it won't exist,

2327
01:39:37.703 --> 01:39:41.703
and that's not true.

2328
01:39:44.236 --> 01:39:46.819
TRAVIS: (sighs)

2329
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:52.750
It'll be interesting either way.

2330
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:57.480
Your face is leaking.

2331
01:39:58.741 --> 01:39:59.940
MARISHA: I hate it.

2332
01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:01.450
TRAVIS: I won't tell anyone.
MARISHA: Don't tell anybody.

2333
01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:02.970
TRAVIS: Yep.

2334
01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:05.683
You're a good friend. You're a good trainer.

2335
01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:09.720
MARISHA: We're still working out tomorrow.

2336
01:40:13.512 --> 01:40:15.870
It's not like I'm letting you
off the hook is all I'm saying.

2337
01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:22.250
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

2338
01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:27.203
MARISHA: Thank you.

2339
01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:29.943
TRAVIS: Of course.

2340
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:33.670
MARISHA: And you're still my captain.

2341
01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.560
Balleater or no.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2342
01:40:42.027 --> 01:40:43.230
LIAM: Throwback Thursday.

2343
01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:48.973
MARISHA: Thank you.

2344
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.470
MATT: As you guys finish your drinks,

2345
01:40:57.470 --> 01:41:01.940
wind down for the night, share a bit of a rousing toast

2346
01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.670
with the Gentleman as we he emerges from his work

2347
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:06.550
for the day, to congratulate you on the multitude of things

2348
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:09.008
that he seems to know about.

2349
01:41:09.008 --> 01:41:10.657
Every detail of your travels.

2350
01:41:10.657 --> 01:41:12.323
LAURA: Eyy.
MARISHA: Wait, what I'd miss?

2351
01:41:12.323 --> 01:41:14.230
How does he, what'd I miss?

2352
01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:18.580
MATT: "Just have a drink."
MARISHA: Okay.

2353
01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.080
MATT: "You're all very talented, it seems,

2354
01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.430
"or extremely stupid, or both."

2355
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:27.590
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a bit of both.

2356
01:41:28.670 --> 01:41:31.220
MATT: "That's a rare combination, but it'll keep you alive.

2357
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:33.800
"Listen to her."

2358
01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:37.420
SAM: What?
TRAVIS: Listen to Jester?

2359
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.044
TALIESIN: Always.

2360
01:41:39.044 --> 01:41:39.985
MATT: "Good.

2361
01:41:45.115 --> 01:41:46.615
"She's got good blood in her.

2362
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:52.664
"Now, rest up.

2363
01:41:52.664 --> 01:41:55.890
"Apparently, you've got a bit
of travel to do in the morning."

2364
01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:57.810
LAURA: I sort of told him what we were doing.

2365
01:41:57.810 --> 01:41:59.360
SAM: That's okay, he's your dad.

2366
01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.300
You can trust him.
LAURA: Yeah.

2367
01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.370
MATT: "I need to go blow off some steam.

2368
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:07.050
"Don't message me for a while."

2369
01:42:07.050 --> 01:42:09.380
LAURA: Oh, he's going to go bone somebody. Gross.

2370
01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:13.530
SAM: Oh, if you're going to, maybe, you might want to just--

2371
01:42:13.530 --> 01:42:14.730
you're schvitzing still.

2372
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:18.469
MATT: His face just goes--

2373
01:42:18.469 --> 01:42:20.585
SAM: Just do a little dab.

2374
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:23.580
Don't wipe, just dab.

2375
01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:24.830
LIAM: A little dab'll do you.

2376
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:29.620
MATT: "Good night."

2377
01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:30.753
And he leaves.

2378
01:42:30.753 --> 01:42:33.820
(laughter)

2379
01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:35.115
TRAVIS: A little dab'll do ya.

2380
01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.806
(laughter)

2381
01:42:36.806 --> 01:42:38.396
MATT: Goddamn it.

2382
01:42:38.396 --> 01:42:40.870
You find a way to your quarters to rest for the night.

2383
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:45.110
Sleep takes you, thoughts of early morning travel

2384
01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:47.470
towards whatever strange direction

2385
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:49.630
and destination calls you.

2386
01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.190
We'll get to that when we come back from the break.

2387
01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:53.463
SAM: Oh.
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

2388
01:42:53.463 --> 01:42:54.990
SAM: Ooh.

2389
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:56.640
TALIESIN: Pick some spells for tomorrow.

2390
01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.740
MATT: We'll return shortly.

2391
01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:59.116
Make sure you get your spells prepared,

2392
01:42:59.116 --> 01:43:00.300
those of you who do that,

2393
01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:01.383
before the next morning.

2394
01:43:01.383 --> 01:43:03.274
We have our giveaway

2395
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.290

SAM: Guess what, America?

2453
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:35.100
Nope.
(beeping)

2454
01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:36.240
Guess what, world?

2455
01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.600
We're back.

2456
01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.310
All Work, No Play.
LIAM: That's inaccurate.

2457
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:41.689
SAM: We're not back?
LIAM: We're not back.

2458
01:45:41.689 --> 01:45:42.810
(beeping)
LIAM: We will be back.

2459
01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:45.636
SAM: Oh, okay.
LIAM: We're coming back at, in--

2460
01:45:45.636 --> 01:45:47.578
(beeping)
LIAM: We don't know when we're coming back.

2461
01:45:47.578 --> 01:45:48.960
We're very close, we've been shooting stuff,

2462
01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.715
we've been doing all kinds of activities, like--

2463
01:45:50.715 --> 01:45:52.445
SAM: Are you looking at that camera?
Should I look at that camera?

2464
01:45:52.445 --> 01:45:53.900
(beeping)
LIAM: Gene splicing,

2465
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.942
intelligence uploads.
SAM: But like that one

2466
01:45:55.942 --> 01:45:57.070
or this one?
(beeping)

2467
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:58.890
SAM: I'm going to just commit to this camera.

2468
01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:02.139
Anyway, catch all that and more on-- oh, hi.

2469
01:46:02.139 --> 01:46:05.320
(beeping)
MARISHA: Clones in the future of me.

2470
01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.470
SAM: I want that.

2471
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:07.303
I want clones.

2472
01:46:07.303 --> 01:46:08.136
LIAM: They won't remember you.

2473
01:46:08.136 --> 01:46:10.780
And you won't know them, and they won't be you.

2474
01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.377
SAM: But I just want more of me around.

2475
01:46:13.377 --> 01:46:14.210
(twinkling music)

2476
01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:17.050
SAM: This season is going to be
packed with amazing stuff like--

2477
01:46:17.050 --> 01:46:18.580
LIAM: Shark baiting.
SAM: Okay.

2478
01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.120
LIAM: Shark dating.
SAM: Uh-huh.

2479
01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.510
LIAM: Shark mating.
SAM: Oh boy!

2480
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:24.720
What else can we do with a shark, I wonder?

2481
01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.085
You'll have to wait to find out.

2482
01:46:26.085 --> 01:46:28.053
(beeping)

2483
01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.270
MARISHA: Yeah, that's pretty good.

2484
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:32.728
Let's do it again.
SAM: (laughs)

2485
01:46:32.728 --> 01:46:34.240
(upbeat music)

2486
01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.810

have a viewing party, I don't know.

2496
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.441
Just watch the (buzzing) show.

2497
01:47:02.441 --> 01:47:05.024
(upbeat music)

2498
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:16.980
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

2499
01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:18.450
BRIAN: Sam, I have a question.

2500
01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:21.240
Are they remaking The Wire and setting it in Beverly Hills

2501
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.341
about the plight of the bike messenger?

2502
01:47:23.341 --> 01:47:25.399
(laughter)

2503
01:47:25.399 --> 01:47:26.270
DANI: Harsh.

2504
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:27.707
BRIAN: What's happening here?

2505
01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:29.630
SAM: Guys, I'm just a hip teen.

2506
01:47:29.630 --> 01:47:31.000
My wife knitted this hat.

2507
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.960
She claims it takes four hours per hat,

2508
01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.000
but I don't know, there's a lot of hats

2509
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:35.833
at our house right now.

2510
01:47:35.833 --> 01:47:38.710
There's probably 15, 18, 20 hats at our house right now.

2511
01:47:38.710 --> 01:47:40.960
DANI: Share the Q hats.

2512
01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:42.802
TRAVIS: (laughing) You-- your--

2513
01:47:42.802 --> 01:47:44.230
SAM: (laughs)

2514
01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:45.710
TRAVIS: It's a huge bong rip, bro.

2515
01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:47.940
SAM: Hey, man.
TRAVIS: Turn your head to the left.

2516
01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:48.840
There you go, yeah.

2517
01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.960
BRIAN: I don't know if we can do this on Twitch.

2518
01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.430
"What was it that ultimately convinced her

2519
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:54.430
"to take the jump?"

2520
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:56.153
TRAVIS: Ooh.

2521
01:47:56.153 --> 01:47:57.911
SAM: (sighs) I mean, deep down, she knew

2522
01:47:57.911 --> 01:48:00.085
she was going to do it at some point,

2523
01:48:00.085 --> 01:48:04.100
and she wanted a moment

2524
01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:08.440
to think about-- this is a big shift, a big change,

2525
01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.360
and sometimes, you want something so long,

2526
01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.540
and you're right at the cusp of it,

2527
01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:14.048
right on the edge of getting it, and you're like,

2528
01:48:14.048 --> 01:48:16.180
"Ooh, wait, do I really want this?"

2529
01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:17.580
TRAVIS: It was also looking across the table,

2530
01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:20.830
and seeing us going, "Do it, you chickenshit coward.

2531
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:22.113
"Do it!" (laughs)

2532
01:48:22.113 --> 01:48:27.113
SAM: Well, there is a bit of Sam Riegel as a D&amp;D player,

2533
01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:28.320
I mean, you got to do stuff.

2534
01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.153
TRAVIS: Yeah.
BRIAN: You got to do stuff.

2535
01:48:29.153 --> 01:48:30.400
SAM: You going to make decisions and go.

2536
01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.390
TRAVIS: Not a play-it-safe-er.

2537
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:35.330
SAM: Yeah, you going to make hard
choices and live with them, so.

2538
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:36.230
BRIAN: Yeah.
SAM: That's,

2539
01:48:37.110 --> 01:48:39.430
you know, you also going to trust that Matt Mercer's

2540
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:42.072
going to have something on the other side for you.

2541
01:48:43.230 --> 01:48:45.170
BRIAN: I just figured it out.

2542
01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:48.650
You look like a homeless millionaire's son.

2543
01:48:48.650 --> 01:48:50.460
SAM: You know why?

2544
01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:53.587
If I may, I can tell why this is throwing you, Brian,

2545
01:48:53.587 --> 01:48:56.790
and why this look is throwing
literally everyone in the studio.

2546
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:58.423
TRAVIS: Oh, okay, yeah.

2547
01:48:58.423 --> 01:48:59.806
SAM: I look like Marisha.

2548
01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.270
BRIAN: Oh no.
SAM: People are confused,

2549
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:04.280
because they're like, why does Marisha look

2550
01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:07.190
particularly extra gorgeous today?

2551
01:49:07.190 --> 01:49:08.990
TRAVIS: Right, yep.
BRIAN: Hey, Travis?

2552
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:10.130
TRAVIS: Yes?

2553
01:49:10.130 --> 01:49:12.370
BRIAN: "This was not the first time that Caduceus mentioned

2554
01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:14.720
"the name Stone, like we talked about a minute ago,

2555
01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.650
"having told the story of Stone, Dust, and Clay before.

2556
01:49:17.650 --> 01:49:19.410
"Is there a reason it clicked with you now,

2557
01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:23.600
"or were you just not listening before?"

2558
01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.300
The question on everyone's mind.

2559
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:28.210
TRAVIS: No, I was not listening before, okay?

2560
01:49:28.210 --> 01:49:29.700
I check in and out.

2561
01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:32.250
Thursday nights for me are a time to enjoy my friends,

2562
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:33.600
some food--

2563
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.750
SAM: Marisha takes notes.

2564
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:36.680
TRAVIS: She is a note-taking machine.

2565
01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:37.990
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Why would I pay attention?

2566
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:39.040
SAM: Why would you pay attention?

2567
01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.150
BRIAN: You can't be bothered with intricate storytelling.

2568
01:49:41.150 --> 01:49:42.817
TRAVIS: No! Look, this is how I got through college.

2569
01:49:42.817 --> 01:49:45.560
I just looked at the person's paper next to mine.

2570
01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.904
SAM: It's rule one of improv, listen when you feel like it.

2571
01:49:47.904 --> 01:49:48.737
TRAVIS: Yep.

2572
01:49:48.737 --> 01:49:50.530
(laughter)

2573
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:52.596
SAM: It's funny to me that your name,

2574
01:49:52.596 --> 01:49:54.260
your last name was Stone.

2575
01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:56.390
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
SAM: And you start,

2576
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:59.570
at least in the theme song, title sequence,

2577
01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:02.600
by sinking to the bottom of the ocean.

2578
01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:03.890
SAM and TRAVIS: Like a stone.

2579
01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:06.240
DANI: What?
BRIAN: Are you fucking high?

2580
01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:09.810
SAM: Yeah, this is what high people think about, yeah.

2581
01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:13.028
TRAVIS: Have you ever looked at a $2 bill

2582
01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.635
on <i>weed</i>?

2583
01:50:15.635 --> 01:50:16.468
(laughter)

2584
01:50:17.756 --> 01:50:20.240
SAM: It looks like a $22 bill.

2585
01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:22.920
TRAVIS: Is there a guy in the bushes?

2586
01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:24.570
I don't know.

2587
01:50:24.570 --> 01:50:26.220
Red Team, go.

2588
01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:27.830
It's from Half Baked,

2589
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:28.663
the greatest movie.

2590
01:50:28.663 --> 01:50:30.821
SAM: Chaos c-- (laughing)

2591
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:33.405
BRIAN: Just take in the secondhand--

2592
01:50:33.405 --> 01:50:36.980
TRAVIS: (inhaling)

2593
01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:39.900
BRIAN: "After learning so much
about Essek in the previous episode,

2594
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:42.520
"and seeing him playing a major part in finishing

2595
01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.720
"that spell as well as the ritual for Nott,

2596
01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.790
"what is your respective character's opinion

2597
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:47.623
"about him now?"

2598
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:51.571
TRAVIS: I don't trust that motherfucker.
SAM: I don't trust him, either.

2599
01:50:51.571 --> 01:50:54.280
(both laughing)
BRIAN: Ah, interesting.

2600
01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.113
SAM: Not a bit.

2601
01:50:55.113 --> 01:50:56.150
BRIAN: Interesting.

2602
01:50:56.150 --> 01:50:59.960
TRAVIS: He just went from being cold and aloof

2603
01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:02.400
to being all of a sudden, really warm

2604
01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.350
and I know there's been time,

2605
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:06.550
and I know it seems like he lives

2606
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:09.520
a very isolated life, and he's probably putting himself

2607
01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:10.610
out there, and all those things,

2608
01:51:10.610 --> 01:51:14.758
and with time, it'll show that he's being genuine.

2609
01:51:14.758 --> 01:51:17.980
SAM: Maybe.
TRAVIS: But all of our haunches were up.

2610
01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.990
We were all on level five alert.

2611
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:23.870
SAM: We've also been giving Essek all this.

2612
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:25.900
We're spilling dirt left and right,

2613
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:30.470
sharing secrets, giving him vials of shit,

2614
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:32.422
telling him about extra dodecahedrons

2615
01:51:32.422 --> 01:51:34.370
that are out there in the world.

2616
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:36.960
We really have opened up.

2617
01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:38.530
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're making him look pretty good.

2618
01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:39.363
SAM: Yeah.

2619
01:51:39.363 --> 01:51:41.430
TRAVIS: I mean, he could just be riding the coattails of,

2620
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:43.610
you know, The Mighty Nein.

2621
01:51:43.610 --> 01:51:44.800
SAM: I would not be surprised, though,

2622
01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.830
if he stabs us in the back.

2623
01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:49.580
BRIAN: "Nott clearly loves Yeza and Luc,

2624
01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:53.950
"but is she still in love with Yeza?

2625
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:55.930
"If they don't have a child,

2626
01:51:55.930 --> 01:51:57.820
"if they didn't have a child, would she be considering

2627
01:51:57.820 --> 01:51:59.080
"going back at all?"

2628
01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.400
SAM: I mean, I don't know.

2629
01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.820
I don't know if she, she hasn't been with him

2630
01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:05.490
for a while, and she, like I said,

2631
01:52:05.490 --> 01:52:07.690
she loves her new life, she loves these people.

2632
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:10.010
TRAVIS: Had all these minotaurs
walking around in front of her.

2633
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:12.160
SAM: She's seen so much now.

2634
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.100
It's hard to be with your high school sweetheart

2635
01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:19.240
and then be exposed to the world.

2636
01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.740
Yeza isn't on her mind every second of every day anymore.

2637
01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:24.740
Used to be.
BRIAN: Well, yeah,

2638
01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:25.873
but there's a lot going on.

2639
01:52:25.873 --> 01:52:27.110
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Little bit.

2640
01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:27.960
BRIAN: Little bit.
TRAVIS: Little bit.

2641
01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:30.650
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

2642
01:52:30.650 --> 01:52:34.990
Oh, man, I feel guilty talking about Yeza.

2643
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:37.780
He's a fictional character, and I feel like

2644
01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:40.020
he's watching this show and he's like,

2645
01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.960
"What the fuck did you say about me?!"

2646
01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.320
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
DANI: He's sitting there, going,

2647
01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.710
"Did you just make fun of my hat?"

2648
01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:46.260
BRIAN: You look so cute doing, it, though.

2649
01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:48.493
You're dressed like Macaulay Cocaine.

2650
01:52:48.493 --> 01:52:51.112
(laughter)

2651
01:52:51.112 --> 01:52:53.170
BRIAN: Do you have any lines in the new Beverly Hills Cop,

2652
01:52:53.170 --> 01:52:54.438
or are you just robbing a Tiffany's?

2653
01:52:54.438 --> 01:52:57.188
(laughter)

2654
01:52:59.196 --> 01:53:00.911
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh my god.

2655
01:53:00.911 --> 01:53:01.744
SAM: Guys.

2656
01:53:02.674 --> 01:53:05.140
I took a big swing with this outfit.

2657
01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:06.820
BRIAN: Yeah.
SAM: Might've failed.

2658
01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:09.250
BRIAN: I mean, we've gotten 89 minutes of material

2659
01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:11.930
out of it tonight, so I think, (laughs).

2660
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:16.810
SAM: It's like, the components of this outfit

2661
01:53:16.810 --> 01:53:18.680
are things that I wear all the time.

2662
01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:19.630
BRIAN: Yeah, but--
SAM: But I think

2663
01:53:19.630 --> 01:53:23.030
when you put them together, it just doesn't feel right.

2664
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:24.710
TRAVIS: I commented back at the office,

2665
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:27.020
you looked very nice.

2666
01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:27.853
I did!

2667
01:53:27.853 --> 01:53:29.410
I said those words.

2668
01:53:29.410 --> 01:53:31.160
BRIAN: You look like you wrote Pitch Perfect.

2669
01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:33.910
(laughter)

2670
01:53:38.405 --> 01:53:40.853
SAM: I don't know what that means.

2671
01:53:40.853 --> 01:53:44.103
(upbeat country music)

2672
01:53:46.891 --> 01:53:49.170
SAM: (cheering) Yeah!

2673
01:53:49.170 --> 01:53:50.120
We did it, yeah!

2674
01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.610
DANI: Sam Riegel, you just won the Superb Bowl.

2675
01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:53.670
What are you going to do now?

2676
01:53:53.670 --> 01:53:56.210
SAM: I'm subscribing to Critical Role!

2677
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:59.137
DANI: Wonderful, and that's--
SAM: It's about perseverance,

2678
01:53:59.137 --> 01:54:01.110
like remembering to resubscribe

2679
01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:02.812
with Twitch Prime every month.

2680
01:54:02.812 --> 01:54:04.130
Yeah, woo, woo, woo.

2681
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:06.320
DANI: So could you--
SAM: Have done it without my teammates?

2682
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.597
Come on, no way.

2683
01:54:07.597 --> 01:54:08.680
And they couldn't have done it

2684
01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:11.670
without the Twitch subscriptions that I gave them.

2685
01:54:11.670 --> 01:54:12.530
Right, guys?

2686
01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:15.020
Yeah.
DANI: Okay, Sam, but what about--

2687
01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:17.455
SAM: What about, what about what inspires me, you mean?

2688
01:54:17.455 --> 01:54:19.800
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

2689
01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:23.110
I mean, watching that dehydrated piece of string cheese

2690
01:54:23.110 --> 01:54:25.340
Brian Foster every couple of weeks,

2691
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.720
really gets me pumped for the big game.

2692
01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.900
DANI: Sam, hold on, we have to--
(Klaxon blaring)

2693
01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.840
SAM: You can't believe it, you can't believe it?

2694
01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:32.780
Is that what you said?

2695
01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:35.460
Well, it's true, because every Yee-Haw VOD

2696
01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:38.610
is instantly available as soon as you subscribe.

2697
01:54:38.610 --> 01:54:39.790
It's amazing.
DANI: Sam.

2698
01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:41.070
SAM: We did it, guys.
DANI: Sam!

2699
01:54:41.070 --> 01:54:42.780
SAM: Yeah, yeah.
DANI: <i>Sam!</i>

2700
01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:44.680
SAM: Yeah! What, sorry?
DANI: Just say,

2701
01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.160
"I'm going to Disneyland."

2702
01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:47.952
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

2703
01:54:47.952 --> 01:54:49.040
SAM: Oh.

2704
01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:54.342
What's a Disneyland?

2705
01:54:54.342 --> 01:54:56.252
(dramatic music)

2706
01:54:56.252 --> 01:54:59.085
(whistle blowing)

2707
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:02.660
SAM: I don't know, I going to be honest with you.

2708
01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.378
DANI: Oh.
SAM: I got hit in the head

2709
01:55:04.378 --> 01:55:07.210
pretty hard out there.
DANI: Oh my god.

2710
01:55:07.210 --> 01:55:10.592
SAM: Woo, I'm not good at sports.

2711
01:55:10.592 --> 01:55:12.558
CROWD: Oh!

2712
01:55:12.558 --> 01:55:17.558
(thudding)
(cheering)

2713
01:55:19.777 --> 01:55:23.360
(folk orchestral music)

2714
02:08:04.252 --> 02:08:05.370
MATT: And welcome back.

2715
02:08:05.370 --> 02:08:08.270
So we have our winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway.

2716
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:12.727
The winner tonight is d__man.
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2717
02:08:12.727 --> 02:08:15.160
MATT: D__man, congratulations.

2718
02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:16.910
We'll get that to you ASAP.

2719
02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:23.720
So, Mighty Nein, after the evening's rest,

2720
02:08:24.010 --> 02:08:25.530
in the morning, you come to,

2721
02:08:25.530 --> 02:08:27.030
and underneath the Evening Nip,

2722
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:31.557
within the confines of the Gentleman's private,

2723
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:35.520
I'm going to say, organizational base,

2724
02:08:37.130 --> 02:08:38.450
the day is early and yours.

2725
02:08:38.450 --> 02:08:39.820
What would you like to do?

2726
02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:42.180
LIAM: How early we talking?

2727
02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:43.460
MATT: You would know, I'd say,

2728
02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:45.160
you guys probably went
to bed relatively early,

2729
02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:47.270
knowing you'd probably
be traveling fairly quick,

2730
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:49.210
so unless you want to
get up any earlier,

2731
02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:51.620
I was say naturally,
around probably 7:00,

2732
02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:53.660
8:00 in the morning.
LIAM: Okay.

2733
02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:56.000
TRAVIS: Should make the most of
the day, yeah, for travel?

2734
02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.392
SAM: Get horses, no?
TALIESIN: Yeah, get some horses.

2735
02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:02.388
TRAVIS: I suppose we could ask
on the way out, if your...

2736
02:09:02.388 --> 02:09:04.829
yeah, does your father have a, you know,

2737
02:09:04.829 --> 02:09:07.740
does he have any steeds, anyone he knows?

2738
02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.930
LAURA: That's a good question.

2739
02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:10.970
I should go ask him.

2740
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:11.803
MATT: Okay.

2741
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:15.670
He's-- it's early, you go to his chambers.

2742
02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:16.887
LAURA: Hey.

2743
02:09:16.887 --> 02:09:19.260
(knocking)

2744
02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:22.310
Are you naked? (knocking)

2745
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:24.230
It's your daughter. (knocking)
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2746
02:09:24.230 --> 02:09:26.389
LAURA: It's Jester. Are you awake? (knocking)

2747
02:09:26.389 --> 02:09:29.008
LIAM: Making up for lost time.

2748
02:09:29.008 --> 02:09:31.040
LAURA: (knocking) Are you awake?

2749
02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:34.520
MATT: You hear the iron
handle like (squeaking)

2750
02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:39.000
and you see a half-asleep,
half-elf woman come to the door

2751
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.616
and be like,

2752
02:09:40.616 --> 02:09:41.691
"Hello?"

2753
02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:45.550
LAURA: Hello.
(laughter)

2754
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:47.788
Is The Gentleman in here?

2755
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:52.580
MATT: "He's indis--" you hear a voice go,

2756
02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:53.950
(as The Gentleman) "Ugh, just leave,

2757
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:56.260
"it's-- go."

2758
02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:57.860
LAURA: Leave, go.

2759
02:09:59.379 --> 02:10:01.180
MATT: Goes and puts the robe over

2760
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.990
and walks out through the chamber.

2761
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:05.610
You can see one of the
other guardians through there,

2762
02:10:05.610 --> 02:10:08.423
like guides her upstairs to leave,

2763
02:10:10.241 --> 02:10:12.130
and the door's ajar, and he's like--

2764
02:10:12.130 --> 02:10:13.180
LAURA: I walk in.

2765
02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:18.458
She is not that great.

2766
02:10:20.170 --> 02:10:24.300
MATT: "Well, you don't know her."
(laughter)

2767
02:10:26.777 --> 02:10:28.320
"What can I do for you?"

2768
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:31.930
LAURA: Do you have any horses?
(laughter)

2769
02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:36.633
MATT: "I take it this is for your journey?

2770
02:10:39.330 --> 02:10:41.750
"I don't own horses.

2771
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:45.240
"I kept debts, and there is a livery that--

2772
02:10:48.370 --> 02:10:50.680
"let me write something for you."

2773
02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:53.940
And throws his robe on,
heads over to this little

2774
02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:56.130
end table task he has in the corner,

2775
02:10:56.130 --> 02:10:58.870
pulls out a sheet of paper,
and just writes something down,

2776
02:10:58.870 --> 02:11:03.610
folds it, goes and takes
one of the small candles

2777
02:11:03.610 --> 02:11:05.740
off to the side, and gets a wax seal,

2778
02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:08.160
presses it in, closes and hands it to you.

2779
02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:10.660
"For this--"
LAURA: While he's off doing that--

2780
02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:11.950
MATT: Okay?

2781
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:13.450
SAM: Ransack the room.

2782
02:11:13.450 --> 02:11:16.212
LAURA: I'm going to get
out my special paints,

2783
02:11:16.212 --> 02:11:17.845
and I'm going to paint...

2784
02:11:19.494 --> 02:11:21.490
a ruby,

2785
02:11:21.490 --> 02:11:23.050
about this big.
TRAVIS: Whoa.

2786
02:11:23.050 --> 02:11:24.790
LAURA: It's not, it doesn't
turn into a real ruby,

2787
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:26.880
but it'll be a glass ruby.

2788
02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.630
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: When it's done.

2789
02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:30.550
It'll look like a ruby.

2790
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:33.390
And I'm going to place
it right next to his bed,

2791
02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:37.110
so he sees it when he
wakes up in the morning

2792
02:11:37.110 --> 02:11:38.927
and when he goes to sleep.

2793
02:11:41.530 --> 02:11:42.363
MATT: Okay.

2794
02:11:43.981 --> 02:11:45.140
Make a stealth check for me.

2795
02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:47.000
Unless, yeah, this would you--

2796
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.311
TALIESIN: As a child of divorce,
I'm so into this right now.

2797
02:11:49.311 --> 02:11:51.880
(laughter)

2798
02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:54.150
LAURA: Ooh, hee, ooh, 22!

2799
02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:56.453
MATT: Okay.

2800
02:11:57.570 --> 02:11:58.740
He seems engrossed in his letter,

2801
02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:01.150
and does not notice you quickly, deftly,

2802
02:12:01.150 --> 02:12:05.050
artistically create this ruby, and place it.

2803
02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:09.030
By the time he finishes
the envelope, and turns around,

2804
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:10.480
you're already right
back where you started,

2805
02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.110
and it goes right into your grasp.

2806
02:12:12.110 --> 02:12:12.943
LAURA: Thank you.

2807
02:12:12.943 --> 02:12:14.680
MATT: "Look for a Kiefer Stables.

2808
02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:16.870
"Kiefer is the proprietor.

2809
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:19.880
"Just hand him the letter, and tell
him how many horses you need.

2810
02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:21.663
"He should take care of it."
LAURA: Thank you so much.

2811
02:12:21.663 --> 02:12:24.840
TALIESIN: Is it in the south
of the-- south of the city?

2812
02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:26.653
MATT: Hmm?

2813
02:12:26.653 --> 02:12:29.150
TALIESIN: Is it the stables
in the south of the city?

2814
02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:31.420
MATT: This would be in the western side.

2815
02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:34.060
TALIESIN: Oh, so it would not be
Kiefer of the southern lands.

2816
02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:36.595
(groaning)

2817
02:12:36.595 --> 02:12:38.066
MATT: No, no.
ASHLEY: Wow.

2818
02:12:38.066 --> 02:12:39.390
SAM: Oh, boy.
TALIESIN: I'll go now.

2819
02:12:40.770 --> 02:12:42.320
ASHLEY: No, please don't.

2820
02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:46.170
LAURA: Thank you for letting
us stay here last night.

2821
02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:47.003
MATT: "Yes.

2822
02:12:48.435 --> 02:12:51.350
"Happy to provide when in need."

2823
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:54.940
LAURA: Thank you for,
you know, being nice to me,

2824
02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:56.580
and being nice to my friends and stuff,

2825
02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:58.450
and it's really good to see you again,

2826
02:12:58.450 --> 02:13:00.590
and I hug him, I give
him a kiss on the cheek.

2827
02:13:01.890 --> 02:13:03.560
MATT: "It's good to see you as well, Jester."

2828
02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:05.376
LAURA: Call Mom...

2829
02:13:06.667 --> 02:13:07.700
whenever, you know,

2830
02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:10.450
just remember she is, you know, she's there,

2831
02:13:10.450 --> 02:13:13.690
she's really pretty, and she's
really great and talented.

2832
02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:14.846
Okay, bye.

2833
02:13:14.846 --> 02:13:17.010
MATT: (laughs) Door closes.

2834
02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:20.520
TALIESIN: Too little ruby.

2835
02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:23.320
LAURA: I know, I should've left
a little sapphire next to it.

2836
02:13:25.110 --> 02:13:25.943
MATT: All right.

2837
02:13:27.108 --> 02:13:29.216
TRAVIS: How did it go? We have horses?
LAURA: We got, well,

2838
02:13:29.216 --> 02:13:30.610
he's, we maybe have horses.

2839
02:13:30.610 --> 02:13:34.110
We're to the Kiefer Stables,

2840
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:37.320
and they owe Dad a debt or something,

2841
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:39.040
and they'll give us
some horses or something.

2842
02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:41.290
SAM: Your dad is hooking us up.

2843
02:13:41.290 --> 02:13:43.800
LAURA: I know!
SAM: Free lodging, free food,

2844
02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.800
free booze, free horses.
LAURA: Yeah.

2845
02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:49.395
SAM: I mean, he loves the shit out of you.

2846
02:13:49.395 --> 02:13:50.243
LAURA: Yeah.

2847
02:13:50.243 --> 02:13:52.059
TRAVIS: Do we have to go and rough anyone up?

2848
02:13:52.059 --> 02:13:55.260
LAURA: I think he's probably making up for
lost time, you know what I mean?

2849
02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:57.010
SAM: Yeah, of course.

2850
02:13:57.010 --> 02:13:58.750
LAURA: Do we have to what?
TRAVIS: Do we have to rough anybody up?

2851
02:13:58.750 --> 02:14:00.270
Do we have to be like intimidating for your dad?

2852
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:01.103
LAURA: I don't think so.

2853
02:14:01.103 --> 02:14:02.070
I just have to give him
this piece of paper.

2854
02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:03.790
Maybe it says somebody's
going to kill them

2855
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:07.130
if they don't give them
what we need, you know?

2856
02:14:07.130 --> 02:14:10.510
SAM: All right, well, let's walk in.
TRAVIS: We'll follow your lead, yeah.

2857
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:12.210
MARISHA: You don't want to read it?

2858
02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:14.850
SAM: It's sealed--
LIAM: There's the wax in it.

2859
02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:15.890
LAURA: Is there a wax thing on it?

2860
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:16.723
MATT: Yes.

2861
02:14:16.723 --> 02:14:18.720
SAM: Beau's the queen of
mail fraud over here.

2862
02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:21.740
She could probably do it.
MARISHA: Easily pop that and reseal it.

2863
02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:24.093
LIAM: Spoilers, it says,
"Give these people some horses."

2864
02:14:24.093 --> 02:14:25.860
SAM: (laughs)
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, right.

2865
02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:27.440
Let's go get the fucking horses.

2866
02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:29.156
TALIESIN: Kill these people, leave
their bodies in a ditch.

2867
02:14:29.156 --> 02:14:30.921
(laughter)

2868
02:14:30.921 --> 02:14:33.180
Let's go full Hamlet here.
(laughter)

2869
02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:34.572
MARISHA: What's the stamp?

2870
02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:38.601
MATT: The stamp is just a simple--

2871
02:14:38.601 --> 02:14:41.651
like it's just a simple G,

2872
02:14:41.651 --> 02:14:45.260
but it's a very meticulously carved G,

2873
02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:48.914
to almost look like a,
for lack of a better term,

2874
02:14:48.914 --> 02:14:52.178
a detailed, intricate lock.

2875
02:14:52.178 --> 02:14:53.760
There's not like a lot
of filagree around it,

2876
02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:56.400
but it has a--
MARISHA: It's cool.

2877
02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.383
MATT: Yes.

2878
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.550
MARISHA: With my background--

2879
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:06.200
SAM: Oh Jesus.
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

2880
02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:07.540
MATT: Yes?
TRAVIS: Can't just get some goddamn horses.

2881
02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:10.760
MARISHA: If I like-- I want to
lift it, and I want to peel it,

2882
02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.230
and I want to start seeing
how hard it might be

2883
02:15:13.230 --> 02:15:15.970
to separate the wax with a knife.

2884
02:15:15.970 --> 02:15:20.260
MATT: I mean, it's going to be hard,
but it's probably doable.

2885
02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:22.160
MARISHA: I hold it up to the light.
Can I see through it?

2886
02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:23.310
Can I read a little bit?

2887
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:24.390
LIAM: This is Act II.

2888
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:25.915
MATT: Make a perception check.

2889
02:15:25.915 --> 02:15:27.339
ASHLEY: (laughing)

2890
02:15:29.381 --> 02:15:31.210
MARISHA: Oh, that was almost good.

2891
02:15:31.210 --> 02:15:32.940
Eight.
MATT: Eight, mm, unfortunately,

2892
02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:34.860
it's very, very solid material.

2893
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:38.540
SAM: It's all right, Beau.

2894
02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:39.890
We'll find out soon enough.

2895
02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:43.357
TALIESIN: We can just be
there when they read it.

2896
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:48.310
SAM: We make our way
to the Kiefer Stables.

2897
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:49.640
MATT: All right.

2898
02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:50.767
Heading westward through Zadash,

2899
02:15:50.767 --> 02:15:53.370
you make your way to the west,
asking a few questions,

2900
02:15:53.370 --> 02:15:55.990
keeping an eye out, you haven't quite--
TALIESIN: Asking questions?

2901
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.823
MATT: Yes.

2902
02:15:56.823 --> 02:16:00.440
You haven't spent a lot of time
on this far end of the city.

2903
02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:01.700
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MATT: Necessarily.

2904
02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:03.730
So it takes a little bit to find out

2905
02:16:03.730 --> 02:16:05.420
where the Kiefer Stables are,

2906
02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:09.460
but upon arriving, they're
not small, they're not big.

2907
02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:12.630
They're just a standard
medium-sized livery.

2908
02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:15.120
There are two individuals
that are in the process

2909
02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:18.670
of providing feed for the--

2910
02:16:19.845 --> 02:16:21.528
you see they have mostly horses.

2911
02:16:21.528 --> 02:16:24.630
There are a couple of beasts
of burden there, as well,

2912
02:16:24.630 --> 02:16:28.000
look like they also sell
those types of creatures,

2913
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.385
two big ox-looking beasts.

2914
02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:36.822
But you enter the front, and
there is one man you see,

2915
02:16:36.822 --> 02:16:40.780
probably in his late 50s, early 60s or so,

2916
02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:45.780
extremely curly, poof red
hair around the back and sides

2917
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:49.860
of a bald head, five o'clock shadow

2918
02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:52.570
all across his chin, with
a bit of a double chin,

2919
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:56.850
just in the process of
organizing stuff for the day,

2920
02:16:56.850 --> 02:16:59.450
putting tools on the walls,
and setting things up

2921
02:16:59.450 --> 02:17:02.642
this early in the morning.
As soon as you walk in, he turns around.

2922
02:17:02.642 --> 02:17:03.790
"Oh, hello.

2923
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:07.343
"Is-- sure, we're open.

2924
02:17:07.343 --> 02:17:08.627
"How can I help you?"

2925
02:17:08.627 --> 02:17:10.960
LIAM: Is this all right? I know it's early.

2926
02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:13.170
MATT: "It's-- you've got here in time.

2927
02:17:13.170 --> 02:17:14.210
"What can I do for you?"

2928
02:17:14.210 --> 02:17:15.590
LAURA: Do you run this place?

2929
02:17:15.590 --> 02:17:17.275
MATT: "I am Kiefer, yes."

2930
02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:20.508
LAURA: I've got a note for you, Kiefer.

2931
02:17:21.350 --> 02:17:22.183
MATT: "Thank you."

2932
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:25.150
LIAM: It's not as ominous as it seems.

2933
02:17:25.150 --> 02:17:26.730
LAURA: Or maybe it is.

2934
02:17:26.730 --> 02:17:27.880
LIAM: Or maybe it is.

2935
02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:30.317
MATT: "All right, mm-hmm.

2936
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:37.580
"Excuse me a moment."

2937
02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:39.930
And he walks over to the side of a desk,

2938
02:17:39.930 --> 02:17:41.970
and pulls up a little, you know, knife,

2939
02:17:41.970 --> 02:17:43.480
and you can see him, he's--

2940
02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.055
his movements are a bit erratic and quick,

2941
02:17:45.055 --> 02:17:46.883
and he opens it.

2942
02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:54.360
"What do you need?"

2943
02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:55.304
SAM: Wow.

2944
02:17:55.304 --> 02:17:57.640
LIAM: (as the Godfather) I'm going to make
him an offer he can't refuse.

2945
02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:00.840
SAM: We need some-- oh, Caleb, do
you want to take care of this?

2946
02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:02.550
LIAM: I-- this is your father's.

2947
02:18:02.550 --> 02:18:04.530
LAURA: Oh, I mean-- but we need some horses.

2948
02:18:04.530 --> 02:18:05.680
MATT: "How many?"

2949
02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:07.040
MARISHA: Yeah, for all of us.
LIAM: Yeah.

2950
02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.990
MARISHA: One each--
SAM: Well, I don't--

2951
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:10.490
MARISHA: One each!
MATT: "Take your pick."

2952
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:12.130
Seven horses, yours.

2953
02:18:12.130 --> 02:18:13.530
SAM: I don't need a horse--

2954
02:18:13.530 --> 02:18:16.000
TALIESIN: If things go well--

2955
02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.470
SAM: I'd rather someone else drive.

2956
02:18:17.470 --> 02:18:19.620
MARISHA: Take the fucking horse.

2957
02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:20.830
TALIESIN: You're only going to need the horses

2958
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:22.200
for this one leg of the journey.

2959
02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:23.450
I'm sure we can--
LAURA: How do we get them

2960
02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:24.830
back to you when we're done with them?

2961
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:26.593
MATT: "Oh, they are yours to keep--

2962
02:18:26.593 --> 02:18:27.670
"if you would like."

2963
02:18:27.670 --> 02:18:28.886
TRAVIS: How generous. Thank you.

2964
02:18:28.886 --> 02:18:30.120
LAURA: Wow.

2965
02:18:32.090 --> 02:18:33.360
SAM: Thank you, Kiefer.

2966
02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:34.310
MATT: "You're welcome.

2967
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:35.790
"We will have them prepared for you.

2968
02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:37.180
"Just tell them which ones you want,

2969
02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:39.503
"and we'll have them outfitted, saddles--"

2970
02:18:39.503 --> 02:18:42.060
LAURA: What did the letter say?
MATT: "-- some extra feed.

2971
02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:42.893
"It's--

2972
02:18:44.801 --> 02:18:45.634
"(exhales)

2973
02:18:46.659 --> 02:18:47.492
"(exhales again)

2974
02:18:47.492 --> 02:18:49.305
"I will provide."

2975
02:18:49.305 --> 02:18:50.752
MARISHA: I want to know so bad.

2976
02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:52.896
MATT: He's basically saying,

2977
02:18:52.896 --> 02:18:54.893
"We will provide feed and
everything you require."

2978
02:18:54.893 --> 02:18:56.226
Wow.
MATT: "We'll load you up."

2979
02:18:56.226 --> 02:18:57.793
LAURA: Holy shit.
MATT: "Whatever you need."

2980
02:18:57.793 --> 02:18:59.310
SAM: We'll meet you outside then.

2981
02:18:59.310 --> 02:19:00.520
LAURA: Thank you.
MATT: "Of course."

2982
02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:01.353
LAURA: So much.

2983
02:19:01.353 --> 02:19:03.245
LIAM: Sometimes, it is just that easy.
LAURA: Wow.

2984
02:19:03.245 --> 02:19:04.361
MARISHA: I go up to him.

2985
02:19:04.361 --> 02:19:06.294
I'll give you 50 gold for that letter.

2986
02:19:06.294 --> 02:19:08.557
SAM: Jesus.
MATT: "Who are you people?"

2987
02:19:08.557 --> 02:19:10.550
MARISHA: I'll take it with me, it'll be gone.

2988
02:19:10.550 --> 02:19:12.290
ASHLEY: 50 gold.

2989
02:19:12.290 --> 02:19:14.212
MARISHA: You'll never see it again.

2990
02:19:16.296 --> 02:19:17.370
SAM: (laughs)

2991
02:19:17.370 --> 02:19:18.950
LAURA: How much would the horses have cost?

2992
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:20.996
50 gold?
(laughter)

2993
02:19:20.996 --> 02:19:22.970
MARISHA: I want to know what it is.

2994
02:19:22.970 --> 02:19:25.420
MATT: No, the horses are a little pricier.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2995
02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:26.840
TRAVIS: She's got his handwriting.

2996
02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:29.020
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2997
02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:30.270
Okay.

2998
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:32.245
MATT: Okay, you look at the letter?
LIAM: Wow.

2999
02:19:32.245 --> 02:19:33.966
MARISHA: I'll wait 'til we leave.
MATT: Okay.

3000
02:19:33.966 --> 02:19:36.632
MARISHA: I don't want to embarrass
the man. I'm a tactful woman.

3001
02:19:36.632 --> 02:19:37.748
TRAVIS: (coughs) Horseshit.

3002
02:19:37.748 --> 02:19:42.100
MATT: Of about, say, 18 or so horses

3003
02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:43.550
that are currently kept here.

3004
02:19:44.719 --> 02:19:46.530
They're-- some of them are healthier,

3005
02:19:46.530 --> 02:19:48.180
some are older, some are younger,

3006
02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:51.103
there are a number to pick from
that all function and work well.

3007
02:19:51.103 --> 02:19:53.200
You find ones that befit
your personalities,

3008
02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:54.650
and have them outfitted.

3009
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:56.900
A week's worth of feed is provided.
LAURA: Wow.

3010
02:19:56.900 --> 02:19:59.050
MATT: Within saddle bags
and other elements there,

3011
02:19:59.050 --> 02:20:00.800
weighing them for a longer journey,

3012
02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:03.140
uncertain of how long you'll be going.

3013
02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:06.150
You're given the full package.

3014
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:08.608
SAM: My horse keeps chasing Fjord's horse.

3015
02:20:08.608 --> 02:20:11.175
(laughter)

3016
02:20:13.567 --> 02:20:15.041
That's a joke that no one will get.

3017
02:20:15.041 --> 02:20:16.640
(laughter)

3018
02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:18.718
TRAVIS: I find a mustang named Caddy.

3019
02:20:18.718 --> 02:20:20.659
MATT: There you go.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

3020
02:20:24.299 --> 02:20:26.682
TRAVIS: Goddamn it.
(laughter)

3021
02:20:26.682 --> 02:20:28.680
Leave me alone!

3022
02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:29.513
MATT: So, um--

3023
02:20:29.513 --> 02:20:31.204
TRAVIS: Don't listen to Sam. Listen to me.

3024
02:20:31.204 --> 02:20:32.600
(laughter)

3025
02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:34.640
MATT: You have your horses,
you have your materials.

3026
02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:35.980
The day is still young.

3027
02:20:35.980 --> 02:20:38.290
No problems, no questions.

3028
02:20:38.290 --> 02:20:41.640
You are free to go and make your way westward.

3029
02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:44.470
LAURA: That went really, really well.

3030
02:20:44.470 --> 02:20:46.640
MARISHA: Are we outside?
TALIESIN: Terrifyingly smoothly.

3031
02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:48.550
MATT: Yeah, you're outside.
You're on horseback.

3032
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:51.030
You're making your way
towards the outer perimeter

3033
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:52.650
of the city walls.

3034
02:20:52.650 --> 02:20:54.350
LAURA: Cool.
MARISHA: I pop the seal,

3035
02:20:54.350 --> 02:20:57.378
and I try really hard, I take out a little--

3036
02:20:57.378 --> 02:20:58.820
LAURA: It's already open.
MATT: It's super easy.

3037
02:20:58.820 --> 02:20:59.845
It's already opened.

3038
02:20:59.845 --> 02:21:01.500
MARISHA: Oh, right.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3039
02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:02.750
Is the seal broken?

3040
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:04.030
Did he crack it?

3041
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:06.380
MATT: He read the letter, so
he had to open it, yes.

3042
02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:08.020
The wax is broken.
MARISHA: Because sometimes you--

3043
02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:10.260
whatever, okay, okay, yeah.

3044
02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:11.620
What's in the letter?

3045
02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:14.311
MATT: All it says is--

3046
02:21:14.311 --> 02:21:15.703
MARISHA: Oh, come on.

3047
02:21:15.703 --> 02:21:17.019
(quietly) Give me something good.

3048
02:21:17.019 --> 02:21:17.852
SAM: (laughs)

3049
02:21:17.852 --> 02:21:19.610
MATT: All it says is,

3050
02:21:20.785 --> 02:21:22.980
"Give them many gifts,

3051
02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:26.390
"whatever they ask, Gentleman."

3052
02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:29.214
MARISHA: (sighs)

3053
02:21:29.214 --> 02:21:30.400
SAM: Could have asked for anything.

3054
02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:32.717
LIAM: There it is, the secret
of the Luxon unmasked.

3055
02:21:32.717 --> 02:21:34.690
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: As he said, though,

3056
02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:35.740
got his handwriting, though.

3057
02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:37.543
TRAVIS: That's 50 gold right there.
SAM: That's good.

3058
02:21:37.543 --> 02:21:40.700
Maybe we could, maybe you could
learn it, forge something.

3059
02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:42.270
LAURA: Send a letter to my mom saying,

3060
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:43.650
"Oh my gosh, I miss you so much"?

3061
02:21:43.650 --> 02:21:45.240
SAM: We could Parent Trap them!

3062
02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:46.690
TALIESIN: Oh, I was worried that
we were going to do that.

3063
02:21:46.690 --> 02:21:47.690
SAM: You could Parent Trap them.

3064
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:50.030
TALIESIN: We got The Parent Trap.
MATT: (crying) Oh no.

3065
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:53.070
SAM: "Meet me here, and--
because I still love you,"

3066
02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:55.850
and then you send a letter to him,

3067
02:21:55.850 --> 02:21:57.630
because you probably know your mom's handwriting.

3068
02:21:57.630 --> 02:21:58.660
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

3069
02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:01.710
SAM: "I want to meet you at
this place, at this time."

3070
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:03.510
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
SAM: And we'll be waiting in the bushes.

3071
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:05.580
LAURA: Then we can watch them reunite.

3072
02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:08.170
TALIESIN: Can we get Patty Duke
on to play The Ruby--

3073
02:22:08.170 --> 02:22:09.040
Oh stop, okay.

3074
02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.640
SAM: We're going to Parent Trap your parents.

3075
02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:12.331
LAURA: I can't wait.

3076
02:22:12.331 --> 02:22:13.530
It's going to be so great, you guys.

3077
02:22:13.530 --> 02:22:14.580
LIAM: Start planning, Matt.

3078
02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:16.460
SAM: Do it at Traveler Con.

3079
02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:18.330
You'll have the Traveler there to guide you.

3080
02:22:18.330 --> 02:22:20.100
TRAVIS: Kill both your parents, it's cool.

3081
02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:21.708
LAURA: It's true.
LIAM: It's not that cool.

3082
02:22:21.708 --> 02:22:23.708
LAURA: I wonder if he would help me.

3083
02:22:23.708 --> 02:22:25.030
SAM: This is a noble pursuit.

3084
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:27.910
TALIESIN: Only works with identical twins.

3085
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:28.960
SAM: I bet he would.

3086
02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:31.340
This seems like exactly what he does.

3087
02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:33.150
He plays pranks and tricks on people,

3088
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:34.600
for a greater good.

3089
02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:36.170
This is a trick that is for the greater good.

3090
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:38.320
LAURA: What could go wrong?
TALIESIN: (snorts)

3091
02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:41.750
SAM: I feel like we need to do this.

3092
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:43.550
MARISHA: Is this one of those
ones that we intervene on,

3093
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:44.600
or we just let it go?

3094
02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:46.257
TRAVIS: I'm not really sure at this point.
MARISHA: All right.

3095
02:22:46.257 --> 02:22:47.815
ASHLEY: Hyah!

3096
02:22:47.815 --> 02:22:50.040
LAURA: Oh, are we going?
(laughter)

3097
02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:52.510
(laughter)

3098
02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:53.343
TALIESIN: Whoa.

3099
02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:56.780
MARISHA: And wipe.

3100
02:22:56.780 --> 02:22:58.083
Scene transition.

3101
02:22:59.381 --> 02:23:01.980
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
SAM: Turn, turn.

3102
02:23:03.189 --> 02:23:04.022
Turn.

3103
02:23:04.022 --> 02:23:06.880
TRAVIS: Use your foot,
use your outside foot.

3104
02:23:07.738 --> 02:23:10.060
ASHLEY: Parent Trap montage starts.

3105
02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:11.920
LIAM: And did we get one per Mighty Nein?

3106
02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:14.560
Are you riding a horse for
the first time ever solo?

3107
02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:17.210
SAM: I think so, and yep,
unless it goes poorly.

3108
02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:19.817
TALIESIN: I'd like to think it's a pony.
MATT: I will say because this is

3109
02:23:19.817 --> 02:23:21.760
technically your first time handling a horse--

3110
02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:24.293
TALIESIN: Yes!
MATT: Make an animal handling check for me.

3111
02:23:24.293 --> 02:23:26.237
LAURA: Oh no.
SAM: That's a two plus one.

3112
02:23:26.237 --> 02:23:29.350
(laughter)

3113
02:23:29.350 --> 02:23:32.890
MATT: I will say your pace
is slightly lessened.

3114
02:23:32.890 --> 02:23:36.550
For the first hour or so
that you're trying to get

3115
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:38.560
Nott's horse to do anything correctly.

3116
02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:40.760
MARISHA: So familiar.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

3117
02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:43.720
MARISHA: Checks out.
TRAVIS: Sam, where are you going?

3118
02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:45.789
LAURA: Nott's horse just
takes off at a gallop.

3119
02:23:45.789 --> 02:23:49.870
MATT: (laughs) East.
(laughter)

3120
02:23:49.870 --> 02:23:52.810
This is-- (laughs)
(laughter)

3121
02:23:52.810 --> 02:23:54.145
Art imitating life.

3122
02:23:57.019 --> 02:24:00.970
But nevertheless, eventually, righting yourselves

3123
02:24:00.970 --> 02:24:04.080
and finding the path,
you continue westward.

3124
02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:08.380
Eventually, to the, I believe
it's the Amber Crossroads,

3125
02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:11.980
and then, continuing westward
towards the Truscan Vale

3126
02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:14.205
on the western side of the Marrow Valley.

3127
02:24:16.050 --> 02:24:19.325
At a fast pace on horseback,

3128
02:24:20.275 --> 02:24:21.941
it's 36 miles a day.

3129
02:24:21.941 --> 02:24:25.390
I'll say it'll take you about
two and a half, three days.

3130
02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:27.680
You can try and push your
horses further if you want,

3131
02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:29.980
but you risk exhaustion both
for yourselves and the horses.

3132
02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:31.610
TALIESIN: Nah.
SAM: We'll just do it.

3133
02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:33.120
TALIESIN: No, we're not dying for time.

3134
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:35.523
TRAVIS: No, we're good.
MATT: Okay.

3135
02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:39.550
First day of travels,
relatively uneventful.

3136
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:42.051
This side of the Vale,
or this side of the Empire

3137
02:24:42.051 --> 02:24:46.770
is not extremely eventful,
especially in the open fields,

3138
02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:48.840
in comparison to some of
the places you've been,

3139
02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:49.990
especially after going to Xhorhas,

3140
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:52.310
and traveling that dangerous landscape,

3141
02:24:52.310 --> 02:24:55.860
the return to the Marrow
Valley and these open roads

3142
02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:59.030
and green, rolling grass
and you know, mild hills

3143
02:24:59.030 --> 02:25:02.130
in the distance with the
framing of the valley mountains

3144
02:25:02.130 --> 02:25:04.630
on each side, it's almost
comfortable and picturesque

3145
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:08.090
to be in a place where you're not completely

3146
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:10.780
left in the unknown of what's
trying to hunt or eat you.

3147
02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.700
As the night grows darker, around--

3148
02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:19.782
let me look at the map one
more time. Do you have the--

3149
02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:21.473
The region here.

3150
02:25:21.473 --> 02:25:23.260
TALIESIN: I'm keeping my eyes
open for anything unusual

3151
02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:24.325
along the route, as well.

3152
02:25:24.325 --> 02:25:28.270
MATT: Correct. So, I'd say you--

3153
02:25:30.330 --> 02:25:34.150
yeah, so continuing westward,

3154
02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:38.210
are you heading along the Bromkiln Byway,

3155
02:25:38.210 --> 02:25:39.560
Bromkiln Byway, or are you just cutting

3156
02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:40.760
right across the valley?

3157
02:25:42.627 --> 02:25:44.750
LAURA: Well, I could cast my 6th-level spell.

3158
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:47.020
SAM: Which is what?
LAURA: Find the Path.

3159
02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:48.620
TALIESIN: That's a straight line, right?

3160
02:25:49.770 --> 02:25:52.350
LAURA: I don't know, it finds
the shortest route, but...

3161
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:56.550
that might take us, you know.

3162
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:58.390
SAM: It's the worst spell ever, by the way.

3163
02:25:58.390 --> 02:25:59.515
LAURA: It's a pretty shitty spell.

3164
02:25:59.515 --> 02:26:02.690
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Waze.
TALIESIN: It's basically Waze.

3165
02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:05.780
LAURA: This finds the shortest,
most direct physical route

3166
02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:08.396
to a specific fixed location.
SAM: It's a line.

3167
02:26:09.797 --> 02:26:11.980
TRAVIS: Jesus--
MATT: Do you want to cast it?

3168
02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:12.813
LAURA: I mean, should I cast it?

3169
02:26:12.813 --> 02:26:14.470
SAM: Sure.
TALIESIN: Hey, you know what?

3170
02:26:14.470 --> 02:26:16.920
This is a spell we're never going to cast.

3171
02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:17.970
We might as well cast it.

3172
02:26:17.970 --> 02:26:19.930
MARISHA: It's so highly situational, yeah.

3173
02:26:19.930 --> 02:26:23.320
MATT: It's super useful, in
the very rare circumstances

3174
02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:25.040
where it is useful.

3175
02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:26.830
Otherwise, it's kind of--
LAURA: Yeah.

3176
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:28.430
TALIESIN: So let's see what happens.
TRAVIS: Do it.

3177
02:26:28.430 --> 02:26:29.263
MATT: Do it.
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

3178
02:26:29.263 --> 02:26:31.450
MARISHA: Wow, I agree with Taliesin.

3179
02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:36.240
It's either this or in a maze in the Abyss.

3180
02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:38.710
SAM: Go for it.
TALIESIN: I say we go.

3181
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:39.993
LAURA: Oh, true.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3182
02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:42.590
MATT: All right.

3183
02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:46.180
So as you shrug, as part of the casting spell,

3184
02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:48.960
it's part of the somatic components of it is--

3185
02:26:51.150 --> 02:26:54.950
you focus and the wind blows by,

3186
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:57.490
you can see the waves of grass and grain

3187
02:26:57.490 --> 02:26:58.941
across the field shift with it,

3188
02:26:58.941 --> 02:27:02.520
and as it does, you see a portion of the grass

3189
02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:04.880
seems to almost grow brighter and taller

3190
02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:06.930
than the rest rapidly.
LAURA: Wow.

3191
02:27:06.930 --> 02:27:09.550
MATT: And it continues in a direct line,

3192
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:11.300
in a direction slightly north

3193
02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:12.510
of where you were already heading,

3194
02:27:12.510 --> 02:27:14.970
but that direction, you can see it carrying

3195
02:27:14.970 --> 02:27:16.680
that way.
LAURA: We go that way?

3196
02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:18.870
TALIESIN: That would be fun.
SAM: All right, let's go.

3197
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:19.703
MATT: All right.

3198
02:27:20.590 --> 02:27:21.660
It is getting dark,

3199
02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:24.322
if you guys want to set camp or push through.

3200
02:27:24.322 --> 02:27:25.650
TALIESIN: Uh.
LAURA: Oh.

3201
02:27:25.650 --> 02:27:29.745
MATT: Because you're now diverging
from the Byway to do this, so.

3202
02:27:29.745 --> 02:27:34.230
LIAM: Well, you just began it,
so follow it a little longer.

3203
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:36.000
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3204
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.158
MARISHA: How long does it go?

3205
02:27:38.158 --> 02:27:40.610
LAURA: It is for a day, but
I have concentrate on it.

3206
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:43.290
Do I have to-- can I sleep when I concentrate?

3207
02:27:43.290 --> 02:27:45.240
MATT: Generally, no.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3208
02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:47.850
LAURA: I should've cast this in the morning, but--

3209
02:27:47.850 --> 02:27:49.620
SAM: That's all right.
We'll get a few hours out of it.

3210
02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:51.570
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LIAM: Follow it a bit.

3211
02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:53.320
MATT: Okay.

3212
02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:56.920
TALIESIN: When we find a place that looks nice

3213
02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:58.628
for setting up camp.
MATT: Okay.

3214
02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:01.770
So as you pull off
into this space here,

3215
02:28:01.770 --> 02:28:06.250
there's patches of
trees and little elements

3216
02:28:06.250 --> 02:28:08.300
of scattered woodland.

3217
02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:11.490
You wait as the last bit
of the sunlight begins

3218
02:28:11.490 --> 02:28:14.760
to escape from the sky,
and the gold and reds

3219
02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:16.760
of sunset begin to vanish
in with the purples

3220
02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:17.893
and blues of night.

3221
02:28:18.769 --> 02:28:20.310
You begin to find a
place to set up camp,

3222
02:28:20.310 --> 02:28:22.110
and you see what looks
to be a distant fire,

3223
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:25.150
maybe about a half mile
or so away from you.

3224
02:28:25.150 --> 02:28:27.890
MARISHA: What kind of fire,
big fire? Or like campfire?

3225
02:28:27.890 --> 02:28:30.230
MATT: Like a standard campfire size.

3226
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:32.560
MARISHA: Can you see any figures, any shapes--

3227
02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:33.810
MATT: Not from this distance.

3228
02:28:35.069 --> 02:28:35.960
You have to get a lot closer.

3229
02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:36.793
SAM: Want me to go check it out?

3230
02:28:36.793 --> 02:28:38.660
TRAVIS: Are we on the flat lands,
or is it sort of a descent

3231
02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:39.560
down to that fire?

3232
02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:42.390
MATT: Right here, there's hills to the north

3233
02:28:42.390 --> 02:28:43.610
and south sides of it, right now,

3234
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:46.020
it's in the middle of a small valley

3235
02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:47.570
between this hilly portion.

3236
02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.550
MARISHA: Let's go?
SAM: All of us?

3237
02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:52.383
MARISHA: No.

3238
02:28:52.383 --> 02:28:53.780
TRAVIS: Well, we can just make camp.

3239
02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:55.080
MARISHA: Just ignore it?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3240
02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:58.550
I mean, they stay over there,
we stay over here.

3241
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:59.983
LAURA: Nott goes, checks it out.

3242
02:28:59.983 --> 02:29:01.733
SAM: I'm going to go check it out, for sure.

3243
02:29:01.733 --> 02:29:03.249
TALIESIN: Well, I was going to say,

3244
02:29:03.249 --> 02:29:04.780
I wonder if we can make camp close enough

3245
02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:07.580
that everything-- we could check it out.

3246
02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:08.413
LAURA: Yeah.

3247
02:29:09.370 --> 02:29:12.380
LIAM: Sleep near the unknown quantity.

3248
02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:13.213
LAURA: Yeah.

3249
02:29:13.213 --> 02:29:14.810
SAM: But we can, we don't even have--
LAURA: Because you have a hut.

3250
02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:16.790
SAM: Yeah, we have a hut.
We could just be wherever.

3251
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:18.670
They don't-- they can fuck off.

3252
02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:21.433
LIAM: Yeah, but, why--?

3253
02:29:21.433 --> 02:29:24.100
Okay, I am a team player.

3254
02:29:24.100 --> 02:29:25.708
LAURA: (laughs)

3255
02:29:25.708 --> 02:29:27.100
LIAM: Is this where we want to be?

3256
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:28.933
TALIESIN: How is this?

3257
02:29:30.270 --> 02:29:31.881
MATT: It's fine.
TALIESIN: It's fine.

3258
02:29:31.881 --> 02:29:34.132
(laughter)

3259
02:29:34.132 --> 02:29:36.790
LIAM: All right.
TALIESIN: It's definitely fine.

3260
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:39.580
LIAM: Muddled, Caleb starts to
do what he needs to do

3261
02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:41.710
to put the dome up, and
it'll be the same color green

3262
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:43.940
as the grass that
is growing all around.

3263
02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:44.773
MATT: All righty.

3264
02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:47.200
You guys bundle up for the night.

3265
02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:48.640
You feel safer in the dome.

3266
02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:49.810
You can keep watch if you'd like,

3267
02:29:49.810 --> 02:29:51.080
or you can all just take a night's rest.

3268
02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:53.250
It lasts for eight hours, so.

3269
02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:55.180
SAM: I want to go check
out that campfire or no?

3270
02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:56.013
LAURA: Yeah--

3271
02:29:56.013 --> 02:29:57.388
TRAVIS: Do <i>you</i> want to go
check out the campfire?

3272
02:29:57.388 --> 02:29:59.368
SAM: I feel like we all want
to check out the campfire.

3273
02:29:59.368 --> 02:30:01.100
TRAVIS: I think it only
matters what you want to do

3274
02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:03.160
in this situation.

3275
02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:06.752
SAM: Ah, yeah, I'll go check it out.
TRAVIS: Well, all right, then.

3276
02:30:06.752 --> 02:30:07.860
LAURA: Do you want me to come close?

3277
02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:09.720
SAM: Of course.
LAURA: Okay, I'll follow,

3278
02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:11.320
but at a distance.

3279
02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:14.320
MARISHA: And I remove the rocks from the dome.

3280
02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:15.170
SAM: The rocks?

3281
02:30:15.170 --> 02:30:16.530
Oh, good idea.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3282
02:30:17.574 --> 02:30:20.930
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit outside
the dome until you guys

3283
02:30:20.930 --> 02:30:24.010
come back, just so that there's
somebody who can hear it

3284
02:30:24.010 --> 02:30:25.200
if you signal for help.

3285
02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:31.040
LIAM: And while they're away,
Caleb will also turn Frumpkin

3286
02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:33.310
into a raven.
MATT: Okay.

3287
02:30:34.532 --> 02:30:36.700
Just go ahead and mark off the elements of that.

3288
02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:41.080
LAURA: I'm going to, as we get close,

3289
02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:44.640
I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on Nott.

3290
02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:46.800
I'm going to cast Cat's Grace,

3291
02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:48.080
so that you have better--

3292
02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:50.090
you have advantage on dexterity checks.

3293
02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:51.933
SAM: Okay.

3294
02:30:51.933 --> 02:30:53.491
TRAVIS: Is that something a cat does?
SAM: I don't know.

3295
02:30:53.491 --> 02:30:54.324
(laughter)

3296
02:30:54.324 --> 02:30:56.657
MATT: Sam's never seen one.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3297
02:30:56.657 --> 02:30:59.100
MARISHA: ♪ Jellicle cats, Jellicle cats, Jellicle cats ♪

3298
02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:01.730
SAM: Oh, yeah.
TRAVIS: Sing it, sing it.

3299
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:03.330
SAM: As we get closer, I'll cast-- well,

3300
02:31:03.330 --> 02:31:06.760
when we get close enough,
I'll cast Invisibility on myself.

3301
02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:09.476
MATT: Okay, well, go ahead and roll
a stealth check as you approach.

3302
02:31:09.476 --> 02:31:11.492
LAURA: Oh, you already get advantage on stealth.

3303
02:31:11.492 --> 02:31:13.308
MATT: Got advantage on it already.

3304
02:31:14.830 --> 02:31:16.800
SAM: 28.
MATT: 28.

3305
02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:19.263
You feel fairly confident
that no one has seen you

3306
02:31:19.263 --> 02:31:22.930
get within a safe distance of the campfire.

3307
02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:26.230
SAM: I'll go invisible.
MATT: All right.

3308
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:29.450
SAM: And creep ever closer, looking for--

3309
02:31:29.450 --> 02:31:30.283
MATT: Okay.

3310
02:31:30.283 --> 02:31:33.890
As you're looking, you can
see the source of the fire

3311
02:31:33.890 --> 02:31:38.847
that appears like there's
a few bundles around it.

3312
02:31:38.847 --> 02:31:40.390
There's a few figures sitting in the bundles,

3313
02:31:40.390 --> 02:31:42.570
looking into the fire.

3314
02:31:42.570 --> 02:31:44.500
You can see there's between the hillock

3315
02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:46.840
place here, there's a little gap,

3316
02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:51.760
and there's some-- what looks like a carcass

3317
02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:54.450
has been left in the outskirts,

3318
02:31:54.450 --> 02:31:56.700
between you and the campfire,

3319
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:59.130
a little bit southward, I guess.

3320
02:31:59.130 --> 02:32:01.740
SAM: They're not cooking it,
it's just a dead thing?

3321
02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:02.573
MATT: Correct.

3322
02:32:02.573 --> 02:32:04.772
So it's a ways away, but there it is.

3323
02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:08.213
SAM: Towards me, or on the other side?
MATT: Towards you.

3324
02:32:08.213 --> 02:32:10.113
SAM: Well, I'm going to go
look at that carcass.

3325
02:32:10.113 --> 02:32:11.540
MATT: Okay.

3326
02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:13.670
As you get closer to the carcass,

3327
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:18.487
you can see, it looks to be a hunt--

3328
02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:22.180
you see there are arrows in it,

3329
02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:24.850
and elements of it have
been butchered and left open.

3330
02:32:24.850 --> 02:32:26.730
Only a little bit of
meat has been cut off,

3331
02:32:26.730 --> 02:32:29.270
and the rest of it's just been left there.

3332
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:31.980
SAM: But what-- do I recognize the animal?

3333
02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:33.870
MATT: You have to get closer
to probably take a look.

3334
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:36.585
SAM: I'll get closer.
MATT: Okay.

3335
02:32:38.603 --> 02:32:42.480
MATT: You get right up next to the carcass

3336
02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:45.285
and look at it, and right
as you do, you hear this--

3337
02:32:45.285 --> 02:32:47.280
(whooshing)
SAM: Oh shit.

3338
02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:49.340
MATT: Go ahead and make
dexterity saving throw for me.

3339
02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:51.163
LAURA: But you get advantage. Nope, that's--
SAM: I do?

3340
02:32:51.163 --> 02:32:52.810
MATT: Not at saving throws, no.

3341
02:32:52.810 --> 02:32:55.780
SAM: Dex save, 12.
MATT: 12!

3342
02:32:57.280 --> 02:32:59.350
<i>You</i> got a 12 on your dex save!

3343
02:32:59.350 --> 02:33:02.790
SAM: Uh-huh, I rolled a three.
MATT: (laughs)

3344
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:05.160
LAURA: Oh no.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

3345
02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:06.750
LAURA: No, he rubbed his hands together.

3346
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:08.600
ASHLEY: He's doing the hands.
MATT: You hear the whoosh,

3347
02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:10.680
and you see, suddenly,
from just over the hill,

3348
02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:13.120
there was a thin, tall tree

3349
02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:15.170
that had been ratcheted down and held,

3350
02:33:15.170 --> 02:33:17.720
go (whooshing) and arch
upward, and suddenly,

3351
02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:20.200
your ankle pulls out from under you,

3352
02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:23.140
and you get flung through
the air for a second,

3353
02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:27.375
and flung down, you hang for a second.

3354
02:33:27.375 --> 02:33:29.050
(squeaking) After you--

3355
02:33:29.050 --> 02:33:30.658
SAM: I'm still invisible, though.
MATT: You are.

3356
02:33:30.658 --> 02:33:32.541
SAM: Okay, but they know that something's there.

3357
02:33:32.541 --> 02:33:34.000
LIAM: Fucking Ewoks.
SAM: Okay.

3358
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:38.280
TALIESIN: You got Looney Tuned.
MATT: Suddenly, the figures all stand up,

3359
02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:40.370
look over in the direction of the tree.

3360
02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:42.420
One of them goes ahead and gets-- grabs a bow,

3361
02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:44.130
and knocks an arrow.
LAURA: I start getting closer,

3362
02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:47.000
sneaking as close as I can.
MATT: You've been following Nott?

3363
02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.887
LAURA: Well, yeah, that's why I was able to--

3364
02:33:48.887 --> 02:33:51.915
I see the tree--
MATT: Oh, yeah, you see the tree go--

3365
02:33:51.915 --> 02:33:54.270
LAURA: Ah, fuck.
MATT: All right.

3366
02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:57.180
SAM: Ah, okay.

3367
02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:58.013
Um...

3368
02:33:59.679 --> 02:34:01.137
I guess if they haven't seen me,

3369
02:34:01.137 --> 02:34:03.010
let's see, what will lose my invisibility?

3370
02:34:03.010 --> 02:34:05.977
Attacking anything, right? Or fire--

3371
02:34:05.977 --> 02:34:07.472
MATT: Attacking and casting a spell.

3372
02:34:07.472 --> 02:34:11.390
SAM: Casting a spell. Attacking--
but using a weapon to cut a rope?

3373
02:34:11.390 --> 02:34:13.241
Is that an attack?
MATT: That won't break it, no.

3374
02:34:13.241 --> 02:34:14.961
SAM: Okay, okay.

3375
02:34:14.961 --> 02:34:16.419
(sighing) Okay.

3376
02:34:16.419 --> 02:34:19.593
LAURA: I'm going to say,
"Traveler, be with me" as I'm going.

3377
02:34:19.593 --> 02:34:20.426
MATT: Okay.

3378
02:34:20.426 --> 02:34:25.280
SAM: I will-- I'll get out my
shortsword, or my dagger,

3379
02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:27.420
and I'll start cutting the rope a bit.

3380
02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:28.290
MATT: Okay.

3381
02:34:28.290 --> 02:34:29.640
Easy enough to cut it,

3382
02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:31.770
and your foot comes lose.
LAURA: 23.

3383
02:34:31.770 --> 02:34:34.930
MATT: It's not a very intricate knot,

3384
02:34:34.930 --> 02:34:36.910
nor is it a-- it's a thick piece of rope,

3385
02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:39.288
but this blade is easy enough to cut through.

3386
02:34:39.288 --> 02:34:41.600
23? You go ahead and approach,
and you can see that the figure's rushing

3387
02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:44.220
towards the tree.
LAURA: Oh shit.

3388
02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:45.780
MATT: You get the sense that, at the moment,

3389
02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:47.340
they do not notice you,

3390
02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:49.570
because they are focused more
on what has just transpired

3391
02:34:49.570 --> 02:34:51.060
at the south of their camp.
LAURA: Okay.

3392
02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:52.410
SAM: How high up am I?

3393
02:34:52.410 --> 02:34:55.720
MATT: Dangling, I'd say you're about 10 feet up.

3394
02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:58.470
SAM: Oh, oh god, I don't know what to do.

3395
02:34:58.470 --> 02:34:59.470
LAURA: I'm going to wait 'til they get closer.

3396
02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:01.560
MATT: Actually, you'd be about
15, because your weight

3397
02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:04.130
is so minimal compared to what
this trap was designed for.

3398
02:35:04.130 --> 02:35:06.805
SAM: Are they around me at this point,
or are they approaching?

3399
02:35:06.805 --> 02:35:09.790
MATT: They're approaching,
and looking up now, and they're like,

3400
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:11.660
you can see the back of their head.

3401
02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:13.650
But actually, you have darkvision, right, as a goblin?

3402
02:35:13.650 --> 02:35:16.790
SAM: I do.
MATT: So you can see an element of them.

3403
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:18.970
They appear to be human,

3404
02:35:18.970 --> 02:35:21.186
simple leather armor, caps on,

3405
02:35:21.186 --> 02:35:23.890
some hunting gear and weapons.

3406
02:35:23.890 --> 02:35:26.670
And they look up at the rope and go,

3407
02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:28.530
"Oh shit, it broke.

3408
02:35:28.530 --> 02:35:30.340
"Where the fuck did it go?

3409
02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:32.255
"Shit, shit."

3410
02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:36.730
SAM: I'll just wait a bit,
see if they run off.

3411
02:35:36.730 --> 02:35:39.398
MATT: Okay. What are you--?

3412
02:35:39.398 --> 02:35:42.320
LAURA: Well, I'm waiting to see
if they attack at Nott or anything.

3413
02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:43.153
MATT: They don't.

3414
02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:45.580
They scatter a bit around the space

3415
02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:46.890
and begin looking in the area.

3416
02:35:46.890 --> 02:35:48.580
One of them goes over, back to the carcass,

3417
02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:50.177
he looks around at it.

3418
02:35:52.810 --> 02:35:54.210
Are you doing anything, Nott?

3419
02:35:54.210 --> 02:35:55.350
SAM: I'm still just waiting.

3420
02:35:55.350 --> 02:35:57.360
They're still around the vicinity, right?

3421
02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:59.970
MATT: They're starting to
scatter a bit, and scan,

3422
02:35:59.970 --> 02:36:01.410
and from this position, you can see

3423
02:36:01.410 --> 02:36:03.820
there are few different corpses,

3424
02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:05.100
of other creatures that have been hunted,

3425
02:36:05.100 --> 02:36:07.310
and you can see they've cooked
up elements of some of them,

3426
02:36:07.310 --> 02:36:10.560
and they've been eating at
the fire in the center,

3427
02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:12.370
and elements have been left out,

3428
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:14.270
and you can see now, from this perspective--

3429
02:36:14.270 --> 02:36:15.840
actually, make a perception check for me.

3430
02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:17.998
SAM: All right--
LAURA: I feel like it's just a hunting party.

3431
02:36:17.998 --> 02:36:21.356
SAM: For sure it does.
18 plus one, 19.

3432
02:36:21.356 --> 02:36:22.189
MATT: 19.

3433
02:36:22.189 --> 02:36:24.660
You can see, near some of
these other corpses,

3434
02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:28.660
there are a few other
contraptions similar to this.

3435
02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:30.547
Sometimes, one of them's a little more

3436
02:36:30.547 --> 02:36:33.750
of a net-type thing, but
these are very, very basic

3437
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:36.030
hunting traps that have
been set up around here.

3438
02:36:36.030 --> 02:36:38.574
SAM: I shouldn't kill them all.
TRAVIS: (snorts)

3439
02:36:38.574 --> 02:36:39.740
LAURA: Probably not.

3440
02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:41.020
SAM: All right.

3441
02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.400
I will, as deftly as possible,

3442
02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:48.345
drop from my location.

3443
02:36:48.345 --> 02:36:49.178
MATT: Okay.

3444
02:36:49.178 --> 02:36:51.210
SAM: And try to land without
making too much noise.

3445
02:36:51.210 --> 02:36:54.143
MARISHA: Three point landing.
MATT: Make stealth check with advantage.

3446
02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:56.550
LAURA: Ooh.
SAM: Natural 20.

3447
02:36:57.430 --> 02:36:58.847
MATT: You don't even take any fall damage.

3448
02:36:58.847 --> 02:36:59.760
(laughter)
You just--

3449
02:37:00.922 --> 02:37:02.872
Just a little bit of dust goes--

3450
02:37:02.872 --> 02:37:04.580
(laughter)

3451
02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:06.563
Super quiet. No one notices.

3452
02:37:06.563 --> 02:37:08.070
You can see them looking around,

3453
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:12.190
and they look a little jittery and nervous,

3454
02:37:12.190 --> 02:37:15.020
as whatever it was broke their trap,

3455
02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:16.360
and they see nothing moving around,

3456
02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:19.600
and they're in a really
unfortunate space right now

3457
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:22.500
of trying to figure what happened.

3458
02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:24.940
SAM: These poor people.
MARISHA: The damn possums.

3459
02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:27.260
LAURA: As far as I know,
Nott is still up in the tree.

3460
02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:29.290
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Okay.

3461
02:37:29.290 --> 02:37:30.945
SAM: Should I rob them first, or just--

3462
02:37:30.945 --> 02:37:31.930
(laughter)

3463
02:37:31.930 --> 02:37:34.698
All right, I'm going to try
to slip between them,

3464
02:37:34.698 --> 02:37:38.674
and keep heading out, keep--
head back to our camp.

3465
02:37:38.674 --> 02:37:39.800
MATT: Okay.

3466
02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:42.370
They do not notice you in
the middle of the night

3467
02:37:42.370 --> 02:37:43.900
with your invisible self,

3468
02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:45.200
who's also super stealthy.

3469
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:48.620
They are, you know,

3470
02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:50.900
you don't really take a
moment to see anything,

3471
02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:53.430
other than just darting through
the gap of where they are.

3472
02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:55.180
TALIESIN: Is there-- there's a tiny piece of rope

3473
02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:56.970
that's just scattering through the--

3474
02:37:56.970 --> 02:37:59.920
is the rope visible that's still around his ankle?

3475
02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:00.753
MATT: Well, no.

3476
02:38:00.753 --> 02:38:03.661
The rope had been cut like,
in a way where it released--

3477
02:38:03.661 --> 02:38:06.370
TALIESIN: Darn, I was really hoping
a tiny little rope just--

3478
02:38:06.370 --> 02:38:07.203
MATT: Yep.

3479
02:38:08.254 --> 02:38:09.604
What are you doing, Jester?

3480
02:38:10.744 --> 02:38:13.210
LAURA: I'm going to wait until
they get far enough away

3481
02:38:13.210 --> 02:38:15.670
from the tree, and then, I'm
going to go try to get Nott

3482
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:17.140
out of the tree.
MATT: Okay.

3483
02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:18.770
SAM: Oh god.
MATT: Okay.

3484
02:38:18.770 --> 02:38:20.880
They eventually begin to circle around

3485
02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:23.123
the northern side, doing their perimeter,

3486
02:38:23.123 --> 02:38:25.940
and you see a moment where
you can scoot through.

3487
02:38:25.940 --> 02:38:27.980
LAURA: Yeah, I go up to the trap.

3488
02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:29.710
MATT: You rush up, and look up in the tree,

3489
02:38:29.710 --> 02:38:32.300
and the rope is just dangling loose.

3490
02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:34.233
LAURA: (whispering) Nott, Nott.

3491
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:36.550
SAM: I've left that area already.

3492
02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:39.180
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Nott.

3493
02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:40.013
Shit.

3494
02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:43.537
I'm going to cast Sending.
SAM: Jester?

3495
02:38:43.537 --> 02:38:46.519
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending to Nott.
SAM: Jester!

3496
02:38:46.519 --> 02:38:49.620
LAURA: Nott, are you still--
are you in the tree?

3497
02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:51.310
Where are you?
SAM: No, I'm not in the tree.

3498
02:38:51.310 --> 02:38:52.976
LAURA: You can't respond. I'm still talking.

3499
02:38:52.976 --> 02:38:56.000
Wait 'til I finish talking,
and then you can respond.

3500
02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.355
Just let me know--
MATT: That's way over the words.

3501
02:38:58.355 --> 02:39:01.100
(laughter)
SAM: I'm not in the tree.

3502
02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:05.870
I've gone, meet-- oh shit, where are you?

3503
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:08.910
TRAVIS: Are you both invisible?

3504
02:39:08.910 --> 02:39:09.970
LAURA: No.
TRAVIS: Oh.

3505
02:39:09.970 --> 02:39:12.354
LAURA: But Nott's like back at camp now.

3506
02:39:12.354 --> 02:39:13.860
MARISHA: (laughs)

3507
02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:17.100
SAM: I point in a direction
where I think she might be,

3508
02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:18.830
and I cast Message.

3509
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:21.370
Can you hear me?

3510
02:39:21.370 --> 02:39:22.595
Jester, where are you?

3511
02:39:24.653 --> 02:39:27.810
MATT: At this point, you're just
out of-- was it a 500 range?

3512
02:39:27.810 --> 02:39:29.718
SAM: No, it's 120, I think.
LIAM: 120?

3513
02:39:29.718 --> 02:39:30.934
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Oh, no.

3514
02:39:30.934 --> 02:39:32.350
MATT: Double check. I thought it was shorter than that.

3515
02:39:32.350 --> 02:39:34.680
LIAM: 120, yeah.
MATT: Yeah, so yeah.

3516
02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:35.821
Nothing.

3517
02:39:35.821 --> 02:39:37.605
SAM: I gotta to go back.

3518
02:39:37.605 --> 02:39:38.438
Shit.

3519
02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:42.390
I'll run back to camp.

3520
02:39:42.390 --> 02:39:45.260
Hey, hey, hey, hi, hi.

3521
02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:47.450
They're not bad at all, they're fine.

3522
02:39:47.450 --> 02:39:49.540
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: Did Jester come back?

3523
02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:50.790
MARISHA: Nope.
LIAM: No.

3524
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:52.440
SAM: Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

3525
02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:53.620
MARISHA: Wait, I--
SAM: No, it's fine.

3526
02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:55.810
It's fine, she's just--
I'll be right back.

3527
02:39:55.810 --> 02:39:56.643
MARISHA: You have five minutes.

3528
02:39:56.643 --> 02:39:59.810
LAURA: I start stealthily making
my way back to our camp.

3529
02:39:59.810 --> 02:40:02.200
ASHLEY: Into the camp?
MATT: Okay.

3530
02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:04.104
Both of you make perception checks.

3531
02:40:04.104 --> 02:40:06.106
(yelling)
(laughter)

3532
02:40:06.106 --> 02:40:09.050
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.
LAURA: Oh no.

3533
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:10.646
SAM: Five.
LAURA: Seven.

3534
02:40:10.646 --> 02:40:11.810
(laughter)

3535
02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:14.876
MATT: You pass each other. (laughs)

3536
02:40:14.876 --> 02:40:16.384
TALIESIN: This is everything I wanted.

3537
02:40:16.384 --> 02:40:18.350
LAURA: All right, I go back to our camp.

3538
02:40:18.350 --> 02:40:21.380
SAM: Jester, Jester, where are you?

3539
02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:23.935
MATT: You see one of them go,
I heard something.

3540
02:40:23.935 --> 02:40:25.620
(laughter)

3541
02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:26.850
LAURA: I peek my head into the bubble.

3542
02:40:26.850 --> 02:40:28.690
Hey, um--
TALIESIN: No, I'm--

3543
02:40:28.690 --> 02:40:30.787
LAURA: Is Nott back then?
LIAM: She was just looking for you.

3544
02:40:30.787 --> 02:40:33.040
LAURA: She was looking for me?
TRAVIS: You've got to be fucking kidding me.

3545
02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:34.720
ASHLEY: She just went to go look for you.

3546
02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:37.270
LAURA: For me?
ASHLEY: You probably just passed each other.

3547
02:40:37.270 --> 02:40:38.978
LAURA: Shit. Okay, okay, okay.

3548
02:40:38.978 --> 02:40:40.540
Don't worry about it, I'll be right back.

3549
02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:42.330
TRAVIS: Or you can stay here.
LAURA: And I go--

3550
02:40:42.330 --> 02:40:44.153
MATT: The two of them now
have bow and arrows nocked--

3551
02:40:44.153 --> 02:40:46.720
LAURA: I'm going to start
shuffling back to get to Nott.

3552
02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:48.620
TALIESIN: In front of the dome.
MATT: The third one has two

3553
02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:49.461
shortswords at the ready,

3554
02:40:49.461 --> 02:40:50.880
and you can see now they're both--

3555
02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:52.082
earlier, they were a little spooked.

3556
02:40:52.082 --> 02:40:55.233
Now, they're like, fuck, something's here.

3557
02:40:56.470 --> 02:40:57.680
So wait, you go running back?

3558
02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:00.059
LAURA: I'm going back to their camp now.

3559
02:41:00.059 --> 02:41:01.500
MATT: Make another stealth check.

3560
02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:04.118
LAURA: Oh!

3561
02:41:04.976 --> 02:41:06.930
23.
MATT: Okay.

3562
02:41:06.930 --> 02:41:07.763
ASHLEY: "23."

3563
02:41:07.763 --> 02:41:09.788
SAM: I'm just scanning around
their camp, looking for her.

3564
02:41:09.788 --> 02:41:11.643
Have they captured her? Is she in a trap?

3565
02:41:11.643 --> 02:41:13.247
I start looking at all the carcasses.

3566
02:41:13.247 --> 02:41:15.740
(laughter)
SAM: Okay.

3567
02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:17.080
LIAM: Shoved her in an ox.

3568
02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:19.160
SAM: Well, like-- I assume there's traps near the--

3569
02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:21.890
MATT: Yeah, you don't see any other traps set off.

3570
02:41:21.890 --> 02:41:24.690
But you see them ready
to go for a fight.

3571
02:41:24.690 --> 02:41:26.882
SAM: Shit, shit.

3572
02:41:30.570 --> 02:41:31.403
Okay.

3573
02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:35.230
I'll go halfway back towards our camp.

3574
02:41:35.230 --> 02:41:37.740
MATT: Okay, both of you guys make perception checks.

3575
02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:39.593
LAURA: Oh no,.
SAM: Is this perception?

3576
02:41:39.593 --> 02:41:41.570
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: 13.

3577
02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:42.403
LAURA: 15.

3578
02:41:42.403 --> 02:41:44.936
MATT: You keep running back to their camp,

3579
02:41:44.936 --> 02:41:46.069
and you stop halfway.

3580
02:41:46.069 --> 02:41:48.093
You don't see each other, because you're both being stealthy

3581
02:41:48.093 --> 02:41:52.350
in the night. You're both

3582
02:41:52.350 --> 02:41:54.010
unable to see each other.

3583
02:41:54.010 --> 02:41:56.110
SAM: I'm going to say a--
ASHLEY: Right next to each other.

3584
02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:58.600
SAM: Say a silent prayer, load up my crossbow

3585
02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.660
with a flare bolt, and shoot it straight up.

3586
02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:04.200
MATT: Okay.

3587
02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:06.410
Jester, as you're running, all of a sudden,

3588
02:42:06.410 --> 02:42:09.750
this bright light (whooshing) fills up the space

3589
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:14.750
around you, and you look up at this flare bolt (whooshing)

3590
02:42:15.260 --> 02:42:18.410
leading this trail of burning flame.

3591
02:42:18.410 --> 02:42:19.490
SAM: Jester!
LAURA: Nott!

3592
02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:22.120
SAM: Jester!
LAURA: Nott, I hear you!

3593
02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:25.350
MARISHA: Yasha.
LAURA: I'm preparing Charm Person.

3594
02:42:25.350 --> 02:42:28.170
MATT: You see three figures now rushing in your direction,

3595
02:42:28.170 --> 02:42:30.090
and as you're preparing, you glance over

3596
02:42:30.090 --> 02:42:32.445
and you hear (sizzling).

3597
02:42:33.530 --> 02:42:34.870
ASHLEY: Pretty tired.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3598
02:42:36.850 --> 02:42:39.340
MATT: Does an 18 hit you?

3599
02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:41.648
The arrow-- (whooshing) pass this way.

3600
02:42:41.648 --> 02:42:42.680
LAURA: Ah!
SAM: Shit.

3601
02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:43.660
Let's go.
LAURA: Oh, no, no, no.

3602
02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:44.820
No, no, no.
SAM: What do you mean, no?

3603
02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:46.464
LAURA: How far away are they?

3604
02:42:46.464 --> 02:42:48.014
MATT: As this point, about 70 feet.

3605
02:42:50.428 --> 02:42:52.340
LAURA: I'm going to, I'm going to.

3606
02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:54.230
MATT: Another arrow comes at you.

3607
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:55.820
LAURA: Then we duck.
MATT: Actually, the two arrows,

3608
02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:58.065
actually now. That's a 22.

3609
02:42:58.065 --> 02:42:59.590
LAURA: Shit.

3610
02:42:59.590 --> 02:43:02.456
MATT: And a 19.

3611
02:43:02.456 --> 02:43:03.756
LAURA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Okay.

3612
02:43:03.756 --> 02:43:05.114
MARISHA: Is she getting pelted with arrows?

3613
02:43:05.114 --> 02:43:05.947
TALIESIN: Yep.

3614
02:43:05.947 --> 02:43:07.148
(laughter)

3615
02:43:07.148 --> 02:43:09.410
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait.
MATT: You take four points

3616
02:43:09.410 --> 02:43:10.443
of piercing damage,

3617
02:43:10.443 --> 02:43:12.909
and you take three points of piercing damage.

3618
02:43:12.909 --> 02:43:13.910
SAM: Let's get out of here!

3619
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:15.904
LAURA: I'm saying wait.
SAM: What do you mean, wait?!

3620
02:43:15.904 --> 02:43:18.640
LAURA: Wait, are they close?

3621
02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:20.370
MATT: No, the two of them are there just loading arrows

3622
02:43:20.370 --> 02:43:21.490
and firing.
LAURA: Ah, I'm going to zig zag

3623
02:43:21.490 --> 02:43:23.448
towards them.
SAM: Zig zag towards them?!

3624
02:43:23.448 --> 02:43:27.148
MATT: (laughs) Okay, you go running--

3625
02:43:27.148 --> 02:43:28.380
LAURA: Wait!
SAM: What are you doing?

3626
02:43:28.380 --> 02:43:29.213
LAURA: Wait!

3627
02:43:29.213 --> 02:43:31.711
MATT: You guys can hear this, by the way.

3628
02:43:31.711 --> 02:43:34.518
You guys saw this flare go, pfft up in the sky,

3629
02:43:34.518 --> 02:43:37.190
and started hearing yelling in the distance.

3630
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:38.450
TALIESIN: I'm walking that direction.

3631
02:43:38.450 --> 02:43:40.494
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- how many are there?

3632
02:43:40.494 --> 02:43:41.327
MATT: There are three of them.

3633
02:43:41.327 --> 02:43:45.790
LAURA: I'm going to cast Charm Person at a 3rd-level.

3634
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:46.781
MATT: Okay.

3635
02:43:46.781 --> 02:43:49.897
(laughter)

3636
02:43:51.511 --> 02:43:53.643
MARISHA: You're using--
MATT: It's a 19 on the first one.

3637
02:43:53.643 --> 02:43:55.290
LAURA: Shit.
MARISHA: -- scare tactics

3638
02:43:55.290 --> 02:43:57.581
to like--
MATT: Natural one on the second.

3639
02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:00.180
Wow, they're actually-- two of them rolled pretty well--

3640
02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:02.150
and 17 on the third one.

3641
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:03.640
LAURA: Well, 17 is is the wisdom check.

3642
02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:05.230
MATT: Okay, so two of them save, one of them doesn't.

3643
02:44:05.230 --> 02:44:06.063
LAURA: Shit.

3644
02:44:06.063 --> 02:44:09.158
MATT: So one of them, who, the one who has both

3645
02:44:09.158 --> 02:44:12.360
of the swords at the sides, stops and goes,

3646
02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:15.398
"Oh, don't worry about it."
(laughter)

3647
02:44:15.398 --> 02:44:17.644
And the other one's like, "What the fuck you talking about?"

3648
02:44:17.644 --> 02:44:20.700
LAURA: It's your friend Jester, it's your friend.

3649
02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:22.084
SAM: What are you doing, Jester?

3650
02:44:22.084 --> 02:44:23.760
Let's run!
LAURA: Why?

3651
02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:25.460
MATT: You guys are approaching now at this point.

3652
02:44:25.460 --> 02:44:28.390
TALIESIN: I'm walking towards, yeah.

3653
02:44:28.390 --> 02:44:30.560
LIAM: Yeah, we walk out, and the dome just goes (whooshing).

3654
02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.310
MARISHA: Yasha.
TALIESIN: I've lit up my staff--

3655
02:44:32.310 --> 02:44:33.143
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3656
02:44:33.143 --> 02:44:36.062
MARISHA: You want to just have a drink
and watch from the hill?

3657
02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:39.125
ASHLEY: Sure.
MARISHA: All right.

3658
02:44:39.125 --> 02:44:41.310
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not going in there.
ASHLEY: They got this.

3659
02:44:41.310 --> 02:44:43.490
MATT: The two that aren't trying to rush up,

3660
02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:44.930
seeing you put your hands there,

3661
02:44:44.930 --> 02:44:45.910
and they have their arrows nocking--

3662
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:47.940
LAURA: Why are you-- don't hit me! It's your friend.

3663
02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:49.448
Did it work?

3664
02:44:49.448 --> 02:44:50.981
MATT: Huh? The two, no.

3665
02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:52.550
Only one of them worked.
LAURA: I know that,

3666
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:53.520
I'm asking them.

3667
02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:55.227
MATT: Oh, you're asking them?

3668
02:44:55.227 --> 02:44:56.850
They both look at each other.

3669
02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.990
You guys currently have, the flare is gone.

3670
02:45:00.990 --> 02:45:02.200
So there's no real light source.

3671
02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:04.100
They don't have as good of eyes as you,

3672
02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:07.380
so one of them goes, and like, the one who's charmed

3673
02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:09.480
in the back, goes, "Hold on, hold on."

3674
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:12.750
Lights a torch, and approaches.

3675
02:45:12.750 --> 02:45:14.793
"Don't worry, they're friends!"
LAURA: We're friends!

3676
02:45:14.793 --> 02:45:15.800
MATT: The two see, as they approach,

3677
02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:17.158
and they look at you and they go,

3678
02:45:18.375 --> 02:45:19.600
"Fuck."

3679
02:45:21.036 --> 02:45:22.551
LAURA: Fuck?
MATT: They look at each other,

3680
02:45:22.551 --> 02:45:26.040
and they both drop their weapons, and go,

3681
02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:27.823
"We didn't know, we're so sorry."

3682
02:45:27.823 --> 02:45:29.020
SAM: Wait.
MATT: "We're so sorry."

3683
02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:29.853
SAM: Okay, who are you?

3684
02:45:29.853 --> 02:45:34.340
MATT: "We're just-- Look, we're hunters.
SAM and LAURA: It's you!

3685
02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:36.770
SAM: It's you again. You fuckers!

3686
02:45:36.770 --> 02:45:38.128
I shoot one in the leg.

3687
02:45:38.128 --> 02:45:40.711
(laughter)

3688
02:45:40.711 --> 02:45:42.470
MATT: Roll it. (laughs)

3689
02:45:42.470 --> 02:45:44.740
TALIESIN: Oh.
LIAM: I was hoping so hard.

3690
02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:46.080
MARISHA: Cheers.
SAM: 22.

3691
02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:47.300
MARISHA: Clink.
ASHLEY: If it's an emergency,

3692
02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:48.920
we can go down there, but I think--

3693
02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:51.600
MARISHA: No, this is more--
ASHLEY: This is a great show.

3694
02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:52.940
SAM: Eight point-- I don't get sneak attack.

3695
02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:54.940
Eight points of damage.
MATT: Okay.

3696
02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:56.550
Which one do you shoot, the one who's holding the torch,

3697
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:58.070
or the two that have the bows?

3698
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:59.380
SAM: The bow guys.
MATT: Okay.

3699
02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:01.490
So they go, (screaming).

3700
02:46:01.490 --> 02:46:03.884
LAURA: What is going--
MATT: "Please don't,

3701
02:46:03.884 --> 02:46:06.260
"don't incinerate us, we didn't know.

3702
02:46:06.260 --> 02:46:07.800
"Look, we're not thieving.

3703
02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:09.033
"We're just hunting."

3704
02:46:09.033 --> 02:46:11.430
LAURA: They were just hunting, Nott.

3705
02:46:11.430 --> 02:46:12.970
SAM: Yeah, but they're assholes.

3706
02:46:12.970 --> 02:46:14.999
MATT: "We listened to you!"

3707
02:46:14.999 --> 02:46:17.490
SAM: Have you been stealing in general?

3708
02:46:17.490 --> 02:46:19.190
MATT: "No, no, no, we haven't, I swear to god,

3709
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:21.310
"we didn't!"
SAM: She can read minds.

3710
02:46:21.310 --> 02:46:22.710
LAURA: I can.
SAM: Read their mind.

3711
02:46:23.950 --> 02:46:25.580
Zone of Truth.
LAURA: Oh, oh, that,

3712
02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:26.850
I don't have it prepared, but I'm--

3713
02:46:26.850 --> 02:46:27.980
SAM: Just say that you're doing it.

3714
02:46:27.980 --> 02:46:29.860
LAURA: I'm casting Zone of Truth on them,

3715
02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:31.070
but I'm not actually--
MATT: Make a deception check

3716
02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:33.109
with advantage.
LAURA: Okay, good.

3717
02:46:36.284 --> 02:46:38.360
Oh, oh, oh, 19 plus.

3718
02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:39.810
SAM: Stuff.

3719
02:46:39.810 --> 02:46:42.893
LAURA: 19 plus five for 24.

3720
02:46:42.893 --> 02:46:44.060
SAM: She can tell the truth.

3721
02:46:44.060 --> 02:46:46.130
She can tell if you're telling the truth.

3722
02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:47.810
MATT: "I don't get it, that's fine."

3723
02:46:47.810 --> 02:46:48.740
LAURA: Have you been stealing?

3724
02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:50.530
MATT: "No."
SAM: Huh.

3725
02:46:50.530 --> 02:46:52.733
LAURA: They're telling the truth.

3726
02:46:52.733 --> 02:46:56.230
MATT: "Well, we haven't been robbing."

3727
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:57.480
LAURA: Mm.
SAM: What does that mean?

3728
02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:00.010
What does that mean?
LAURA: What does that mean?

3729
02:47:00.010 --> 02:47:01.860
MATT: "We're not doing like," he's like, "Shut up, man,"

3730
02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:05.560
He's like, "I can't lie. "She put the magic on us.

3731
02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:07.780
"Well, when we--

3732
02:47:07.780 --> 02:47:10.120
"We're not robbing people, we're not anymore,

3733
02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:12.200
"and you know, couldn't afford everything,

3734
02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:13.770
"so we took a couple of things when they weren't looking,

3735
02:47:13.770 --> 02:47:14.845
"and it wasn't a big thing."

3736
02:47:14.845 --> 02:47:16.269
LAURA: That's not that bad.
SAM: That's fine.

3737
02:47:16.269 --> 02:47:17.560
LAURA: As long as you're not attacking people

3738
02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:18.890
when you're stealing things, right?

3739
02:47:18.890 --> 02:47:20.600
MATT: "We're selling pelts and stuff."

3740
02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:22.010
LAURA: Oh, okay, that's very good.

3741
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:24.100
I'm proud of you for making an honest living.

3742
02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:26.210
SAM: We were just checking up on you to make sure you were

3743
02:47:26.210 --> 02:47:28.170
on the straight and narrow.

3744
02:47:28.170 --> 02:47:30.360
MATT: And the guy with the torch goes, "I believe them."

3745
02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:32.020
(laughter)

3746
02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:35.712
LIAM: A giant red ape lumbers slowly past Jester--

3747
02:47:35.712 --> 02:47:38.245
MATT: "(screaming)" They just run,

3748
02:47:38.245 --> 02:47:40.369
they just run screaming into the night.

3749
02:47:40.369 --> 02:47:43.336
LAURA: No, come back. You have all your pelts.

3750
02:47:43.336 --> 02:47:45.050
LIAM: And the ape starts picking through their camp,

3751
02:47:45.050 --> 02:47:46.058
and just looking through shit.

3752
02:47:46.058 --> 02:47:48.334
(laughter)

3753
02:47:48.334 --> 02:47:49.950
TALIESIN: Well.
LAURA: You know what?

3754
02:47:49.950 --> 02:47:52.610
I'm really proud of them.
SAM: They have made a change.

3755
02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:54.426
They've turned over a new leaf.

3756
02:47:54.426 --> 02:47:55.592
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3757
02:47:55.592 --> 02:47:57.475
SAM: They look healthier. They're clothed.

3758
02:47:57.475 --> 02:48:00.170
LAURA: Yeah, they looked like they were eating good.

3759
02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:02.650
TALIESIN: I assumed I'd have to cure somebody.

3760
02:48:02.650 --> 02:48:04.440
I heard terrible screaming and--

3761
02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:06.390
SAM: Nah, we got it handled.
LAURA: Just going to cut off

3762
02:48:06.390 --> 02:48:08.580
lots of little pieces of meat for you to Sprinkle.

3763
02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:11.019
TALIESIN: You've got a little arrow.

3764
02:48:11.019 --> 02:48:13.500
LAURA: Oh, yeah, they hit me a couple of times.

3765
02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:14.480
SAM: Oh, yeah.
TALIESIN: Look at that.

3766
02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:15.990
LAURA: Yeah, it's sticking out of my--

3767
02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:17.360
LIAM: Can I ape through their camp?

3768
02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:18.580
MATT: Yes, you can.

3769
02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:20.400
LIAM: Okay.

3770
02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:21.310
SAM: Feces.

3771
02:48:21.310 --> 02:48:23.910
LIAM: A, this would be what?
MATT: An investigation check,

3772
02:48:23.910 --> 02:48:25.250
we're using the--
SAM: Right.

3773
02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:27.546
That's a nine.
MATT: A nine. All right.

3774
02:48:27.546 --> 02:48:28.850
There are the carcasses.

3775
02:48:28.850 --> 02:48:30.560
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: In which you

3776
02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:32.470
instinctually grab and one, and like (chomping).

3777
02:48:32.470 --> 02:48:33.303
LIAM: Yeah.

3778
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:37.120
MATT: There's a collection of pelts, actually.

3779
02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:38.101
SAM: Oh.

3780
02:48:38.101 --> 02:48:42.290
MATT: And you can see the remnants of other hunting jobs

3781
02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:43.280
they're bringing with them.

3782
02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:45.460
Whether, you get the sense based on what they had,

3783
02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:47.950
they were in the process of heading back into some town.

3784
02:48:47.950 --> 02:48:50.170
LAURA: Aw, I hope they come back.
MATT: To sell their wares.

3785
02:48:50.170 --> 02:48:52.240
LIAM: Capeleb puts a bunch of pelts on his head like a hat,

3786
02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:54.380
and then just lumbers back to their campsite.

3787
02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:56.337
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

3788
02:48:56.337 --> 02:48:58.790
SAM: We're back.
TRAVIS: How did that go?

3789
02:48:58.790 --> 02:49:00.410
SAM: It was fine.
LAURA: Oh my gosh,

3790
02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:02.790
we ran into some old friends. It was super fun.

3791
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:05.615
ASHLEY: You defused the situation pretty well.

3792
02:49:05.615 --> 02:49:06.448
MARISHA: It was great.

3793
02:49:06.448 --> 02:49:08.330
ASHLEY: We knew you had it so--
MARISHA: Great into the night.

3794
02:49:08.330 --> 02:49:09.850
LAURA: Did you see us?
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we thought

3795
02:49:09.850 --> 02:49:12.163
about intervening, and then, we realized we didn't want to.

3796
02:49:12.163 --> 02:49:14.046
SAM: Do you remember the Valley Bandits?

3797
02:49:14.046 --> 02:49:14.879
MARISHA: We do.

3798
02:49:14.879 --> 02:49:16.709
SAM: We met them again.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3799
02:49:16.709 --> 02:49:18.870
LIAM: (ape breathing)
LAURA: Caleb was an ape.

3800
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:20.440
SAM: Capeleb was there.

3801
02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:22.252
TRAVIS: What's on his head?
LIAM: (ape grunting)

3802
02:49:22.252 --> 02:49:24.620
SAM: A hat.
TRAVIS: Skin.

3803
02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:26.803
LIAM: He drapes it all the way over Fjord,

3804
02:49:26.803 --> 02:49:28.520
so you can't even see his head anymore.

3805
02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:31.240
MATT: It's just a big bear pelt that's mostly tanned,

3806
02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:32.680
it's still a little damp in places.

3807
02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:34.266
TRAVIS: It's very warm and disgusting.

3808
02:49:34.266 --> 02:49:35.880
LAURA: Mm.
SAM: You know,

3809
02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:37.720
every time we see them, they're doing a little better.

3810
02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:40.860
Maybe next time we see them, they'll be running

3811
02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:43.020
a business--
LAURA: Or have a store somewhere?

3812
02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:44.290
TRAVIS: How many were there?

3813
02:49:44.290 --> 02:49:46.330
SAM: We saw three, so it could've been more.

3814
02:49:46.330 --> 02:49:48.290
TRAVIS: And you let them go, you didn't injure them

3815
02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:49.790
or kill any.
LAURA: Well, Nott sort of

3816
02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:52.200
hurt one of them.
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Oh.

3817
02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:53.725
SAM: I shot one with a--

3818
02:49:53.725 --> 02:49:55.449
ASHLEY: We did see them running away from you.

3819
02:49:55.449 --> 02:49:57.289
LAURA: That was because of Caleb.

3820
02:49:57.289 --> 02:49:58.122
ASHLEY: Oh.

3821
02:49:58.122 --> 02:50:00.140
LIAM: (ape panting)

3822
02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:00.973
TRAVIS: Well, that's good.

3823
02:50:00.973 --> 02:50:02.750
I'm you glad you probably stopped them from thieving,

3824
02:50:02.750 --> 02:50:04.190
right? They were probably doing something illegal.

3825
02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:06.430
SAM: They actually freely admitted

3826
02:50:06.430 --> 02:50:08.960
to have done <i>some</i> bad things.
LAURA: Right.

3827
02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:11.640
But no more than we do bad things, you know?

3828
02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:12.980
MARISHA: Hmm.
SAM: Yes.

3829
02:50:12.980 --> 02:50:15.660
They were just-- this was an honest thing

3830
02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:17.020
that they were doing here tonight,

3831
02:50:17.020 --> 02:50:18.680
that we scared them away from doing.

3832
02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:20.140
LAURA: Yeah, and stole their pelts that they were--

3833
02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:22.040
SAM: But it's like the Scared Straight program.

3834
02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.160
You know, we just keep scaring them,

3835
02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:25.960
and eventually, they'll go straight.

3836
02:50:27.690 --> 02:50:28.600
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Does that--

3837
02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:30.210
LAURA: Okay, I don't-- yeah.

3838
02:50:30.210 --> 02:50:32.820
MARISHA: I think I read records about that never working.

3839
02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:35.562
SAM: Well, we're trying.

3840
02:50:36.970 --> 02:50:38.410
TRAVIS: Can we go to sleep now.

3841
02:50:38.410 --> 02:50:40.900
SAM: Yes, feel free.
LAURA: Sorry about that, Fjord.

3842
02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:42.210
MATT: All right.

3843
02:50:42.210 --> 02:50:44.310
LIAM: Caleb starts recreating the hut.

3844
02:50:44.310 --> 02:50:45.570
MATT: Fair enough.

3845
02:50:45.570 --> 02:50:48.030
This evening's rest is far more uneventful

3846
02:50:48.030 --> 02:50:50.340
as the campfire in the distance slowly peters

3847
02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:52.250
to a darkness.
LAURA: They probably would've

3848
02:50:52.250 --> 02:50:54.050
wandered in here, you know?

3849
02:50:54.050 --> 02:50:55.250
SAM: For sure.
LAURA: Tried to see

3850
02:50:55.250 --> 02:50:56.650
what was going on.
TRAVIS: Not a chance.

3851
02:50:56.650 --> 02:50:57.980
LAURA: They would never have noticed us.

3852
02:50:57.980 --> 02:50:59.920
They're not that talented.

3853
02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:03.820
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, in case, they would've noticed us,

3854
02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:06.080
you certainly took care of the problem.

3855
02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:08.310
LAURA: That's true.
ASHLEY: Well done.

3856
02:51:08.310 --> 02:51:11.660
LAURA: We do have, lots of horses sitting right outside

3857
02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:13.995
of our bubble, so--
MARISHA: They could've taken

3858
02:51:13.995 --> 02:51:15.850
the horses, yep.

3859
02:51:15.850 --> 02:51:17.450
TALIESIN: That really felt like there was a lesson here,

3860
02:51:17.450 --> 02:51:19.870
and I'm pretty sure we haven't learned it.

3861
02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:23.270
MARISHA: Got to protect Toilet Jr. and Crapper Jr.

3862
02:51:23.270 --> 02:51:25.180
SAM: Oh, that's right.
MARISHA: John, Jr.

3863
02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:26.630
LAURA: Old W.C.

3864
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:29.488
MARISHA: Good ol' W.C., J.R.

3865
02:51:30.483 --> 02:51:31.937
ASHLEY: Are those the horses' names?

3866
02:51:31.937 --> 02:51:33.604
SAM: Yeah.

3867
02:51:33.604 --> 02:51:34.795
MARISHA: They are now.

3868
02:51:34.795 --> 02:51:35.853
(laughter)

3869
02:51:35.853 --> 02:51:36.894
MATT: That's canon.

3870
02:51:38.290 --> 02:51:42.230
Evening is uneventful, rest comes easy.

3871
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:43.490
The next morning, bright and early,

3872
02:51:43.490 --> 02:51:45.750
the warmth of the sun would hit you,

3873
02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:48.170
if you weren't inside the dome when it begins

3874
02:51:48.170 --> 02:51:51.050
to grow warm, but however, the dome does eventually fade

3875
02:51:51.050 --> 02:51:54.630
and you all come to have your morning meal

3876
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:56.330
before stepping onto your horses, and continuing again.

3877
02:51:56.330 --> 02:51:58.410
Are you casting Find the Path again?

3878
02:51:58.410 --> 02:52:00.360
LAURA: Oh, man it's a 6th-level spell,

3879
02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:01.907
what do you guys think?
TALIESIN: Yeah, do it.

3880
02:52:01.907 --> 02:52:03.480
LAURA: Oh, man, all right.

3881
02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:05.640
MATT: Where is it leading you to now?

3882
02:52:07.809 --> 02:52:10.620
LAURA: To the Isharnai, the Pri--
MATT: Okay.

3883
02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:12.630
SAM: Nope, wait, wait, we're going straight to her?

3884
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:14.890
We're not going to go to Beau's dad?

3885
02:52:14.890 --> 02:52:17.080
MARISHA: Kamordah?
LAURA: Oh.

3886
02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:19.270
I just figured if we could go straight to her.

3887
02:52:19.270 --> 02:52:20.103
SAM: Do we know where she is?

3888
02:52:20.103 --> 02:52:21.940
We don't where she is.

3889
02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:23.840
TALIESIN: We're going--
MATT: The spell will probably

3890
02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:25.430
take you there.
SAM: Oh, I thought it had to be

3891
02:52:25.430 --> 02:52:27.620
a place that you know.
MATT: Does it say that?

3892
02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:28.650
TALIESIN: I think it does.

3893
02:52:28.650 --> 02:52:30.950
LAURA: No, it says, that you're familiar with.

3894
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:31.850
SAM: You don't know where she lives.

3895
02:52:31.850 --> 02:52:33.030
MATT: But you, well, she scryed on it,

3896
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:34.900
so she would know--
SAM: You know the location?

3897
02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:36.940
LAURA: I'm familiar with it.
SAM: Oh, with the place, oh.

3898
02:52:36.940 --> 02:52:38.240
LIAM: So we're shortcutting us.

3899
02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:39.510
SAM: Great.
TALIESIN: I thought we were going to go,

3900
02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:40.890
I thought we were going there

3901
02:52:40.890 --> 02:52:41.723
just to get--
LAURA: But yeah,

3902
02:52:41.723 --> 02:52:42.870
that makes sense.
TALIESIN: A little more data.

3903
02:52:42.870 --> 02:52:45.290
LAURA: We should probably do that first.

3904
02:52:45.290 --> 02:52:47.859
MATT: Up to you.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3905
02:52:47.859 --> 02:52:49.584
LIAM: What do you want to do?
SAM: Beau?

3906
02:52:49.584 --> 02:52:52.100
MARISHA: I mean, if we need further confirmation,

3907
02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:53.820
we only have this name from a book.

3908
02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:56.420
LAURA: That's not necessarily that we need confirmation.

3909
02:52:56.420 --> 02:52:59.460
Fjord is going to make a choice for us.
TRAVIS: Go to Beau's house!

3910
02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:00.293
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3911
02:53:00.293 --> 02:53:03.093
ASHLEY: Because we are assuming that
that woman is the same--

3912
02:53:03.093 --> 02:53:05.840
MARISHA and ASHLEY: The same woman.
TALIESIN: We're pretty sure,

3913
02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:08.040
but I would also like to know what

3914
02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:10.470
we're really dealing with, which we don't really know.

3915
02:53:10.470 --> 02:53:12.560
SAM: To <i>Maison</i> Lionett!

3916
02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:14.030
LAURA: Yeah, let's go to--

3917
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:15.760
So we don't need the Find the Path for that.

3918
02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:16.740
You know where we're going.

3919
02:53:16.740 --> 02:53:19.400
MARISHA: Yeah, more or less.

3920
02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:21.040
TALIESIN: We are out in the middle of nowhere right now.

3921
02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:24.941
LIAM: That way's north, so where do we go if that is north?

3922
02:53:24.941 --> 02:53:27.282
MARISHA: West.
TRAVIS: East!

3923
02:53:27.282 --> 02:53:29.460
MATT: You made this journey a number of times in your youth.

3924
02:53:29.460 --> 02:53:31.410
You know how to guide them to Kamordah.

3925
02:53:31.410 --> 02:53:33.570
TRAVIS: Ee-ooh-- well--
TALIESIN: Hit the 405,

3926
02:53:33.570 --> 02:53:35.852
it's all muscle memory at this point.

3927
02:53:35.852 --> 02:53:39.699
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: One to one west, north.

3928
02:53:39.699 --> 02:53:44.520
LAURA: (gibberish)

3929
02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:46.690
MATT: We get it, you have a baby.

3930
02:53:46.690 --> 02:53:47.523
LAURA: Sorry.
(laughter)

3931
02:53:47.523 --> 02:53:48.356
MATT: No, it's fine.

3932
02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:51.696
ASHLEY: Hyah!

3933
02:53:51.696 --> 02:53:54.210
(laughter)

3934
02:53:54.210 --> 02:53:55.375
TRAVIS: The horses just take off running.

3935
02:53:55.375 --> 02:53:58.013
We're not on them at all. Yasha!

3936
02:53:58.013 --> 02:54:01.580
ASHLEY: Goddamn it, we're not even ready to go.

3937
02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:02.910
MATT: I love it, I love it.

3938
02:54:02.910 --> 02:54:06.640
TRAVIS: Lost an hour.
ASHLEY: We haven't packed up the food yet!

3939
02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:09.320
MATT: The second day of travel, along the path,

3940
02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:12.940
guided by Beauregard, also uneventful.

3941
02:54:14.260 --> 02:54:18.270
You do see occasionally some couriers on horseback,

3942
02:54:18.270 --> 02:54:21.190
riding quickly across the southern road.

3943
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:23.130
Most of them travel upon the Bromkiln Byway,

3944
02:54:23.130 --> 02:54:27.030
but you guys have taken the path separately

3945
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:29.780
that heads to the Bromkiln Hills and Kamordah directly,

3946
02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:31.970
based on the direction the spell took you,

3947
02:54:31.970 --> 02:54:33.220
to cut off a little bit of time.

3948
02:54:33.220 --> 02:54:34.053
You can take the road.

3949
02:54:34.053 --> 02:54:35.180
The road is generally considered safer,

3950
02:54:35.180 --> 02:54:36.880
if people can't defend themselves.

3951
02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:39.560
But you guys generally don't have to worry

3952
02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:43.160
too much about that, so cutting the corners on this,

3953
02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:45.160
you come to the second night's rest.

3954
02:54:46.130 --> 02:54:48.530
You set up the camp.

3955
02:54:49.410 --> 02:54:52.697
And the evening comes to claim you for a night of sleep.

3956
02:54:53.730 --> 02:54:55.160
LIAM: In the middle of the night,

3957
02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:58.770
Caleb is not sleeping too well.

3958
02:54:58.770 --> 02:55:01.527
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: And looks over at Yasha.

3959
02:55:06.367 --> 02:55:08.367
ASHLEY: I don't like sleeping.

3960
02:55:09.890 --> 02:55:11.182
LIAM: You don't sleep easy?

3961
02:55:14.713 --> 02:55:18.287
ASHLEY: I seem to be not very good at it lately.

3962
02:55:20.130 --> 02:55:21.830
Some nights have been easier, but,

3963
02:55:27.763 --> 02:55:31.529
I sometimes don't like to go sleep

3964
02:55:31.529 --> 02:55:34.768
and possibly dream, you know?

3965
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:40.895
LIAM: You have not been yourself for awhile?

3966
02:55:43.942 --> 02:55:45.150
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3967
02:55:46.470 --> 02:55:50.833
I guess I'm trying to figure out what that is right now.

3968
02:55:56.210 --> 02:55:59.440
Things just feel a little weird,

3969
02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.440
but I'm getting through it. (sighing)

3970
02:56:06.828 --> 02:56:08.995
LIAM: It's fresh.

3971
02:56:11.090 --> 02:56:12.423
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3972
02:56:15.769 --> 02:56:16.877
Um.

3973
02:56:21.977 --> 02:56:25.077
I hope I'm not being too

3974
02:56:29.918 --> 02:56:32.634
forward in asking you this, but,

3975
02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:38.332
how do you deal with it?

3976
02:56:44.310 --> 02:56:46.908
I--
LIAM: Is it that obvious?

3977
02:56:51.195 --> 02:56:52.845
ASHLEY: I guess from someone who knows.

3978
02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:04.083
I've only heard things about,

3979
02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:08.240
your past, but.

3980
02:57:10.910 --> 02:57:11.743
LIAM: Mm.

3981
02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:14.430
ASHLEY: We don't have to talk about it.

3982
02:57:14.430 --> 02:57:18.277
I just.
LIAM: Nott?

3983
02:57:22.610 --> 02:57:27.520
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't remember, actually.

3984
02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:29.287
LIAM: Nott.

3985
02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:41.362
Sometimes, I feel like two people.

3986
02:57:44.370 --> 02:57:46.078
I'm better with them,

3987
02:57:47.950 --> 02:57:49.535
and one of me is,

3988
02:57:57.905 --> 02:57:59.910
my thing is old.

3989
02:58:02.510 --> 02:58:05.177
So I guess I'm accustomed to it.

3990
02:58:12.010 --> 02:58:15.400
I thought that we were similar when we first met.

3991
02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:20.392
It's not just, it's not just Obann.

3992
02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:26.350
You have blood in your eye.

3993
02:58:30.670 --> 02:58:31.503
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3994
02:58:44.557 --> 02:58:46.165
LIAM: I'm sorry.

3995
02:58:47.320 --> 02:58:49.003
ASHLEY: Why are you sorry?

3996
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:58.429
LIAM: Um.

3997
02:58:58.429 --> 02:59:00.595
LIAM: I see

3998
02:59:02.504 --> 02:59:04.862
hesitation and regret in you.

3999
02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:09.620
And it is like a mirror.

4000
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:15.982
I know regret, and I regret,

4001
02:59:20.230 --> 02:59:21.063
I regret,

4002
02:59:25.888 --> 02:59:28.338
and unless my intuition is very off,

4003
02:59:31.730 --> 02:59:33.321
you know regret.

4004
02:59:37.880 --> 02:59:39.685
ASHLEY: So it never goes away?

4005
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.903
LIAM: No.

4006
02:59:51.649 --> 02:59:52.482
But.

4007
02:59:55.778 --> 03:00:00.723
It's easier with people around you,

4008
03:00:05.370 --> 03:00:07.512
to make you feel more like you.

4009
03:00:16.264 --> 03:00:18.031
ASHLEY: I feel a little bit like,

4010
03:00:22.830 --> 03:00:25.467
the forgiveness is almost harder to deal with.

4011
03:00:29.840 --> 03:00:31.373
I feel like anger is

4012
03:00:34.370 --> 03:00:36.353
an emotion that

4013
03:00:39.769 --> 03:00:43.052
I know how to deal with, because that's where I live.

4014
03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:48.310
But I feel like,

4015
03:00:52.180 --> 03:00:54.808
with everyone being so nice and accepting,

4016
03:00:54.808 --> 03:00:56.675
I don't know how to handle it.

4017
03:01:07.140 --> 03:01:12.095
I know I'm not handling it well, but I'm trying.

4018
03:01:16.330 --> 03:01:19.539
LIAM: Caleb is spinning a diamond over and over and over

4019
03:01:19.539 --> 03:01:22.910
and over and over and over and over in his hand.

4020
03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:28.263
I don't think we can.

4021
03:01:31.218 --> 03:01:32.301
But...

4022
03:01:35.691 --> 03:01:38.593
while we are never going to wash our hands,

4023
03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:41.380
we can use them

4024
03:01:43.529 --> 03:01:46.637
to leave something better in the world,

4025
03:01:50.941 --> 03:01:54.300
and maybe the curtain never rises from our eyes,

4026
03:01:54.300 --> 03:01:58.583
but what else do we do?

4027
03:02:02.790 --> 03:02:06.953
You either lose yourself to it, and forget,

4028
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:12.170
or you do your part.

4029
03:02:22.093 --> 03:02:26.093
They're pretty-- and he looks around at them all--

4030
03:02:28.010 --> 03:02:29.473
they're pretty great.

4031
03:02:32.306 --> 03:02:33.764
We don't deserve them.

4032
03:02:43.086 --> 03:02:44.653
ASHLEY: Do you love her?

4033
03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:54.033
LIAM: Who?

4034
03:02:58.260 --> 03:02:59.810
ASHLEY: I don't need to tell you who.

4035
03:03:10.230 --> 03:03:11.538
I'm sorry, I--

4036
03:03:18.391 --> 03:03:20.820
as someone who has lost someone that

4037
03:03:22.678 --> 03:03:24.750
they love very much,

4038
03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:28.720
I know how important it is to say things

4039
03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:30.435
before it is too late.

4040
03:03:37.390 --> 03:03:39.023
LIAM: It's too late, Yasha.

4041
03:03:41.820 --> 03:03:43.286
It's too late.

4042
03:03:53.390 --> 03:03:55.040
ASHLEY: Maybe not, I don't know.

4043
03:03:56.820 --> 03:03:58.670
LIAM: Reach out just a hand and

4044
03:04:00.290 --> 03:04:02.660
look away and pat the top of her hand, and then,

4045
03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:07.262
curl up and face the outside of the dome.

4046
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:14.555
ASHLEY: I just stay sitting up and watching him.

4047
03:04:18.180 --> 03:04:19.780
MATT: There's a flash in the distance.

4048
03:04:24.370 --> 03:04:25.720
Another one a moment later.

4049
03:04:29.494 --> 03:04:30.800
There's a storm brewing.

4050
03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:38.711
It's comforting.

4051
03:04:44.794 --> 03:04:48.377
ASHLEY: I close my eyes and I try to sleep.

4052
03:04:53.330 --> 03:04:57.359
MATT: The morning eventually comes for you all.

4053
03:04:58.660 --> 03:05:02.830
As the spell fades, and the morning sun

4054
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:05.290
does not peek through, as the previous morning did.

4055
03:05:05.290 --> 03:05:07.960
Instead, as the dome begins to fade,

4056
03:05:08.850 --> 03:05:13.720
the wet rain begins to suddenly fill the space,

4057
03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:15.310
and you all rapidly grab your things,

4058
03:05:15.310 --> 03:05:18.144
and start bundling it up quickly.
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh, ugh.

4059
03:05:20.486 --> 03:05:21.955
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, yep.

4060
03:05:21.955 --> 03:05:23.280
LAURA: Are we almost there, Beau?

4061
03:05:23.280 --> 03:05:24.429
Are we almost there?

4062
03:05:24.429 --> 03:05:28.390
MARISHA: We're going to be riding
in this shit <i>all fucking day</i>.

4063
03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:32.940
It's going to take the rest of the day, right?

4064
03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:33.940
MATT: For the most part.

4065
03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:39.145
MARISHA: All right, this is going to suck, let's go.

4066
03:05:40.850 --> 03:05:41.700
LIAM: Hyah!

4067
03:05:41.700 --> 03:05:44.460
ASHLEY: Hyah!
(laughter)

4068
03:05:44.460 --> 03:05:46.540
MATT: Getting back onto horseback,

4069
03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:48.870
continuing following Beauregard's lead across

4070
03:05:49.940 --> 03:05:52.010
the Truscan Vale, ignoring the roads,

4071
03:05:52.010 --> 03:05:54.572
onwards towards the Bromkiln Hills.

4072
03:05:55.770 --> 03:05:58.020
Most of the day progresses,

4073
03:05:58.020 --> 03:06:00.090
all of you getting bundled with your cloaks

4074
03:06:00.090 --> 03:06:02.800
and materials close, to maintain heat,

4075
03:06:03.719 --> 03:06:05.110
and as as much dryness as you can,

4076
03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:08.460
though elements of the rain seep into your boots.

4077
03:06:08.460 --> 03:06:11.815
You can feel the moisture causing your skin to clam within.

4078
03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:16.860
Looking up ahead, you can see the mountain range

4079
03:06:16.860 --> 03:06:19.910
of this side of the Cyrios Mountains

4080
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:22.650
beginning to grow larger and larger,

4081
03:06:23.800 --> 03:06:28.550
until you begin to see the greenish grassy plains

4082
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:30.650
of the Truscan Vale begin to give way

4083
03:06:30.650 --> 03:06:32.020
to a different coloration.

4084
03:06:33.310 --> 03:06:36.100
The grass has begun to become duller,

4085
03:06:37.470 --> 03:06:42.250
brown and yellow in places, and as you reach

4086
03:06:42.250 --> 03:06:44.930
the beginning of the Bromkiln Hills themselves,

4087
03:06:44.930 --> 03:06:46.540
you can see already, not beyond,

4088
03:06:46.540 --> 03:06:49.450
that the hills getting larger and oddly shaped,

4089
03:06:49.450 --> 03:06:53.640
but the landscape go from patches of completely lack

4090
03:06:53.640 --> 03:06:57.180
of vegetation, where it's just cracked ground and mud,

4091
03:06:57.180 --> 03:07:00.938
to areas where you can see all manner of strange colored

4092
03:07:02.500 --> 03:07:06.170
earth and mud and minerals beginning to emerge

4093
03:07:06.170 --> 03:07:08.560
from what look almost like small steam vents

4094
03:07:08.560 --> 03:07:10.690
that rise from the ground.

4095
03:07:14.700 --> 03:07:16.570
As you begin to--
MARISHA: We're close.

4096
03:07:16.570 --> 03:07:17.970
SAM: This is where you grew up?

4097
03:07:19.390 --> 03:07:20.450
MARISHA: Shitty, right?

4098
03:07:20.450 --> 03:07:21.900
SAM: Doesn't look like farmland.

4099
03:07:23.310 --> 03:07:24.493
MARISHA: Exactly.

4100
03:07:28.570 --> 03:07:31.830
MATT: Heading towards the outskirts of Kamordah,

4101
03:07:31.830 --> 03:07:35.200
as you crest one of the hills, begin to see

4102
03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:38.350
in the later hours of the day,

4103
03:07:38.350 --> 03:07:41.110
not quite nearing sunrise yet

4104
03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:43.020
but dark enough where the clouds remain overhead

4105
03:07:43.020 --> 03:07:47.910
that you can see the lights of all the interior lit homes

4106
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:51.810
of the village just begin to make their way

4107
03:07:51.810 --> 03:07:53.210
to your eyes on the horizon.

4108
03:07:54.580 --> 03:07:57.630
All around you, the smell changes, too.

4109
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:59.500
As opposed to wet earth and grass,

4110
03:07:59.500 --> 03:08:02.640
you can smell strange minerals.

4111
03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:07.625
Some smell sweet and have almost a jasmine-type

4112
03:08:08.533 --> 03:08:10.140
pleasant smell to it,

4113
03:08:10.140 --> 03:08:15.140
and then, waves of heavy sulfur and other deep,

4114
03:08:15.330 --> 03:08:18.270
earth minerals emerging from

4115
03:08:18.270 --> 03:08:20.670
what you can now see around you, pockets of very heavy,

4116
03:08:20.670 --> 03:08:23.070
geothermal activity that seem to be brewing

4117
03:08:23.070 --> 03:08:25.507
through the nearby landscape.

4118
03:08:26.430 --> 03:08:29.230
You can see dozens and dozens of sorts of these vents,

4119
03:08:29.230 --> 03:08:30.863
just this gentle white mist

4120
03:08:30.863 --> 03:08:32.850
and every now and then, you'll see a small,

4121
03:08:32.850 --> 03:08:36.550
little geyser (hissing) emerge from spots.

4122
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:39.010
TRAVIS: Oh, is there a volcano around here?

4123
03:08:40.612 --> 03:08:42.312
MARISHA: I think one that used to be active

4124
03:08:42.312 --> 03:08:44.170
a long time ago in the mountains.

4125
03:08:45.328 --> 03:08:47.360
This whole landscape

4126
03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:50.450
is filled with geothermal activity and steam vents.

4127
03:08:50.450 --> 03:08:53.340
LIAM: Don't stick your hands into any of the water.

4128
03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:55.710
It will melt, it will slough right of your bones.

4129
03:08:55.710 --> 03:08:57.802
LAURA: What?! Have you seen it happen?

4130
03:08:59.420 --> 03:09:01.340
LIAM: No, just heard stories.

4131
03:09:01.340 --> 03:09:03.320
LAURA: That sounds-- Beau, have you seen it happen?

4132
03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:04.910
You lived around here.

4133
03:09:04.910 --> 03:09:08.290
MARISHA: We used to throw in snails and shit in there,

4134
03:09:08.290 --> 03:09:09.430
and see what would happen.

4135
03:09:09.430 --> 03:09:10.330
That was fun.

4136
03:09:10.330 --> 03:09:11.898
LAURA: That's really fucked up.

4137
03:09:11.898 --> 03:09:12.948
MARISHA: Yeah.

4138
03:09:12.948 --> 03:09:13.781
Yeah.

4139
03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:16.830
We were kids.

4140
03:09:18.222 --> 03:09:20.840
But yeah, let's keep going, though.

4141
03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:25.604
LAURA: How does Beau seem compared to how's she's normally?

4142
03:09:25.604 --> 03:09:27.845
LIAM: Totally good, doing great.

4143
03:09:29.500 --> 03:09:30.380
MATT: Beau?
MARISHA: Awesome.

4144
03:09:30.380 --> 03:09:32.600
LIAM: Yeah, blue skies.

4145
03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:34.580
MATT: How do you seem, Beau?

4146
03:09:34.580 --> 03:09:35.413
Anxious?

4147
03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:40.053
MARISHA: Barricaded behind emotional walls.

4148
03:09:40.053 --> 03:09:42.790
TRAVIS: I'm trapped in a glass case of emotions.

4149
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:43.820
MATT: There you go.
LAURA: More closed off

4150
03:09:43.820 --> 03:09:45.028
than she's been in a while?

4151
03:09:45.028 --> 03:09:46.390
MATT: Yes.

4152
03:09:46.390 --> 03:09:47.860
Definitely.

4153
03:09:47.860 --> 03:09:49.820
If anything, it's shades of the first time

4154
03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:51.720
you guys met coming through.

4155
03:09:55.250 --> 03:09:56.780
Heading towards the outskirts of the city,

4156
03:09:56.780 --> 03:09:59.880
as you approach the actual town proper,

4157
03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:03.240
there are wrought iron gates and small stone walls

4158
03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:06.320
about waist to chest high in places.

4159
03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:08.520
The ground itself gives way to mud, a combination

4160
03:10:08.520 --> 03:10:12.400
of the recent weather, and probably the strange,

4161
03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:16.488
ashen ground that makes up a lot of the town here.

4162
03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:21.880
Vineyards, you know and have heard

4163
03:10:21.880 --> 03:10:24.060
that fine wines come from here.

4164
03:10:24.060 --> 03:10:27.030
This does not look like a landscape that would be kind

4165
03:10:27.030 --> 03:10:31.970
to any sort of standard vineyard.

4166
03:10:33.950 --> 03:10:36.130
At the front of the city, there are a few

4167
03:10:36.130 --> 03:10:38.450
of the town's guard posted,

4168
03:10:38.450 --> 03:10:41.050
that keep an eye as you approach,

4169
03:10:42.040 --> 03:10:45.130
careful and untrusting, but keeping to their space,

4170
03:10:45.130 --> 03:10:49.740
looking over each of you intently as you go.

4171
03:10:49.740 --> 03:10:51.040
MARISHA: How's the weather today?

4172
03:10:52.180 --> 03:10:53.020
Is it still rainy?

4173
03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:54.871
MATT: Oh, it's still rainy.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4174
03:10:54.871 --> 03:10:56.363
Okay.
LAURA: Gray.

4175
03:10:56.363 --> 03:10:57.588
LIAM: It is not a sunny day.

4176
03:10:57.588 --> 03:11:00.521
(laughter)

4177
03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:03.020
MATT: Yeah, the thunder and lightning that rolled

4178
03:11:03.020 --> 03:11:06.450
through the night seems to have faded through the day,

4179
03:11:06.450 --> 03:11:09.560
but it is still raining pretty hard.

4180
03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:14.240
Heading inward, you can see, this is a town

4181
03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:17.381
built largely of pale rock

4182
03:11:17.381 --> 03:11:20.431
and dull, petrified wood,

4183
03:11:20.431 --> 03:11:22.490
which you know is a lot of the forests in the mountains

4184
03:11:22.490 --> 03:11:24.660
surrounding here. Some of it's very lush

4185
03:11:24.660 --> 03:11:28.010
from how rich, how mineral-rich a lot of the earth is,

4186
03:11:28.010 --> 03:11:31.133
and other areas have just died off,

4187
03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:35.960
since whatever altered this mountain range happened,

4188
03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:38.002
the lush forest that once carried it all,

4189
03:11:38.002 --> 03:11:42.575
patches of them just withered up,

4190
03:11:42.575 --> 03:11:45.610
and that becomes very cheap wood to build with.

4191
03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:48.940
So it's funny.

4192
03:11:48.940 --> 03:11:51.720
For as much as you hear about wealth and

4193
03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:54.740
the Truscan Vale is known to be a rich area--

4194
03:11:54.740 --> 03:11:57.403
Deastok in particular, to the south--

4195
03:11:58.287 --> 03:12:00.840
this town, the elements that you're seeing

4196
03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:04.160
upon arriving, seem a little more ramshackle,

4197
03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:05.850
and in some ways reminding you of Shadycreek Run,

4198
03:12:05.850 --> 03:12:08.620
though not as seedy, necessarily.

4199
03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:13.620
But definitely built for function over aesthetics.

4200
03:12:15.220 --> 03:12:18.820
A lot of the people you can see bringing their workloads

4201
03:12:18.820 --> 03:12:21.530
through the streets, themselves hoods and cloaks up,

4202
03:12:21.530 --> 03:12:23.570
looking miserable in the weather,

4203
03:12:23.570 --> 03:12:25.820
shouting to each other and pulling materials through.

4204
03:12:25.820 --> 03:12:27.770
You can see carts exiting past you,

4205
03:12:27.770 --> 03:12:31.488
heading toward the southern side of the city as they leave,

4206
03:12:31.488 --> 03:12:35.100
a number of them carrying what look to be large barrels,

4207
03:12:36.060 --> 03:12:37.650
some of these exports on their way out,

4208
03:12:37.650 --> 03:12:41.450
and well-armed guards watching them as they go.

4209
03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:43.970
MARISHA: See how miserable everyone looks?

4210
03:12:43.970 --> 03:12:46.470
SAM: I mean, they're probably drunk,

4211
03:12:46.470 --> 03:12:48.490
because everyone's drunk on wine, right?

4212
03:12:48.490 --> 03:12:50.170
This is wine place.

4213
03:12:50.170 --> 03:12:51.460
MARISHA: Nah, it just sucks.

4214
03:12:52.500 --> 03:12:56.010
TRAVIS: Caduceus, your homeland, you said it was dying,

4215
03:12:56.010 --> 03:12:58.740
right, the nature was dying?

4216
03:12:58.740 --> 03:13:00.050
Is it like this?

4217
03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:01.583
Is this natural?

4218
03:13:01.583 --> 03:13:02.866
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: No.

4219
03:13:02.866 --> 03:13:04.041
MATT: Because there are--

4220
03:13:05.420 --> 03:13:08.280
this is different, but it's still very alive,

4221
03:13:09.576 --> 03:13:10.642
it's just a different kind of life.

4222
03:13:10.642 --> 03:13:13.270
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is not the same.

4223
03:13:13.270 --> 03:13:16.050
MARISHA: Farmlands here passed from hand to hand

4224
03:13:16.050 --> 03:13:18.740
and farmer to farmer, and they kept selling it off

4225
03:13:18.740 --> 03:13:21.600
trying to get shit to grow, and of course

4226
03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:25.410
they couldn't get anything to grow until my dad,

4227
03:13:25.410 --> 03:13:27.490
maybe a couple other farmers came in,

4228
03:13:28.560 --> 03:13:31.730
threw down some grapes, and it turns out

4229
03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:34.130
that the mineral-rich soil

4230
03:13:34.130 --> 03:13:36.980
and the shitty weather

4231
03:13:37.979 --> 03:13:42.979
from all the ocean mist makes for some great fucking grapes.

4232
03:13:44.550 --> 03:13:45.508
TALIESIN: Mm.

4233
03:13:45.508 --> 03:13:46.510
MARISHA: Grapes.

4234
03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:49.600
A lot of grapes. So many fucking grapes.

4235
03:13:51.260 --> 03:13:53.890
TRAVIS: Right, all that stuff and some crazy old woman.

4236
03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:55.870
MARISHA: Yeah.

4237
03:13:55.870 --> 03:13:57.350
MATT: Passing through, you can see what you know

4238
03:13:57.350 --> 03:13:59.870
is the Mud Fields, which are an element

4239
03:13:59.870 --> 03:14:02.590
of a lower end residential town,

4240
03:14:02.590 --> 03:14:04.580
though it's not a slum, per se,

4241
03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:09.470
but it's the standard workers' homesteads here.

4242
03:14:09.470 --> 03:14:13.850
The streets themselves brown and mucky,

4243
03:14:13.850 --> 03:14:15.558
especially with all the water that's starting

4244
03:14:15.558 --> 03:14:16.450
to flood in some places.

4245
03:14:16.450 --> 03:14:17.900
Some folks are in the process

4246
03:14:17.900 --> 03:14:20.940
of currently taking buckets and making sure

4247
03:14:20.940 --> 03:14:23.690
that certain areas don't get too soggy.

4248
03:14:23.690 --> 03:14:27.670
You can see situated greenhouses that are arranged in places

4249
03:14:27.670 --> 03:14:29.780
that are enclosed entirely,

4250
03:14:29.780 --> 03:14:31.840
where it seems some semblance of green

4251
03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:34.800
is being maintained from the interior.

4252
03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:39.248
You know these people have brought soil from other locations

4253
03:14:39.248 --> 03:14:41.800
and have begun to try and find what other types

4254
03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:45.990
of vegetation do take to the landscape here,

4255
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:47.340
and some do.

4256
03:14:47.340 --> 03:14:51.720
Not as profitable as wine is, and even then,

4257
03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:54.700
it's very selective of which patches of land do.

4258
03:14:54.700 --> 03:14:56.780
Making your way through the Mud Fields,

4259
03:14:56.780 --> 03:14:58.650
you eventually head towards what is called

4260
03:14:58.650 --> 03:15:03.100
the Rainbow Vineyards, which is along the base

4261
03:15:03.100 --> 03:15:07.220
of the mountains here that lead into the Cyrios range.

4262
03:15:08.170 --> 03:15:10.580
There are these winding cliffs, and you can see

4263
03:15:10.580 --> 03:15:13.047
where they've carved walkways that go up the side,

4264
03:15:13.047 --> 03:15:15.118
and there are buildings held in.

4265
03:15:15.118 --> 03:15:16.880
There are heavy ropes dangling

4266
03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:21.290
where materials and goods are

4267
03:15:21.290 --> 03:15:23.290
brought down to lower elevation,

4268
03:15:23.290 --> 03:15:26.930
or carried up on high, as well as donkeys and horses

4269
03:15:26.930 --> 03:15:30.520
carrying things up these paths if need be.

4270
03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:33.900
You can see clusters and clusters of oddly-colored

4271
03:15:35.710 --> 03:15:37.940
grape vines, all just set

4272
03:15:37.940 --> 03:15:39.520
upon the entire mountainside here.

4273
03:15:39.520 --> 03:15:42.910
And when I say mountainside, it visually is a mountainside,

4274
03:15:42.910 --> 03:15:44.710
but none like what you've seen.

4275
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:47.520
There are layers and layers, and the colors transition

4276
03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:50.970
brightly from a dull gray to a bright yellow,

4277
03:15:50.970 --> 03:15:53.930
to almost a dripping orange in some locales.

4278
03:15:53.930 --> 03:15:58.060
There's areas where you can see pools of hot, hot water,

4279
03:15:58.060 --> 03:16:01.450
that are emerging in these puddles of mud,

4280
03:16:01.450 --> 03:16:02.990
where it's boiling and bubbling,

4281
03:16:02.990 --> 03:16:05.770
the coloration turning blue at the edges almost,

4282
03:16:05.770 --> 03:16:08.110
and around that edge, you can see cultivating

4283
03:16:08.110 --> 03:16:12.200
additional grape vines, and other strange, odd plants

4284
03:16:12.200 --> 03:16:13.160
that are starting to take in there,

4285
03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:16.330
all very carefully under watch, and very carefully guarded

4286
03:16:16.330 --> 03:16:18.290
and well-manned, and you get the sense

4287
03:16:18.290 --> 03:16:20.990
that there's probably a lot of the--

4288
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:24.130
at least a surprising section of this town makes its living

4289
03:16:24.130 --> 03:16:27.138
tending to vineyards here.

4290
03:16:27.138 --> 03:16:28.360
LIAM: As they've been traveling through here,

4291
03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:30.970
Frumpkin the raven goes (flapping)

4292
03:16:30.970 --> 03:16:33.530
and lands on Beauregard's shoulder,

4293
03:16:33.530 --> 03:16:35.490
and not sharp or painful or hard at all,

4294
03:16:35.490 --> 03:16:40.490
but every once in awhile, gives a little (tapping),

4295
03:16:40.490 --> 03:16:42.887
and Caleb doesn't look at all. He's just faced forward.

4296
03:16:42.887 --> 03:16:44.012
MATT: Okay.

4297
03:16:44.012 --> 03:16:45.010
MARISHA: What, Frumpkin?

4298
03:16:45.010 --> 03:16:47.930
Stop. Stop!

4299
03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:57.810
MATT: You can feel the muscles of your back

4300
03:16:57.810 --> 03:17:02.810
and shoulders and neck, tightening and knotting

4301
03:17:03.310 --> 03:17:07.220
in a way that you can't remember experiencing.

4302
03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:12.270
The heat that's building along the back of your neck

4303
03:17:12.270 --> 03:17:14.560
and your spine is tremendous,

4304
03:17:14.560 --> 03:17:17.520
matching almost what you imagine the temperature

4305
03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:20.230
of these steam pits that are slowly releasing,

4306
03:17:20.230 --> 03:17:22.630
the cold rain hitting, and the hot steam

4307
03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:24.087
being released from it.

4308
03:17:24.087 --> 03:17:27.190
For a moment, you feel almost like you're matching

4309
03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:29.210
that temperature.

4310
03:17:29.210 --> 03:17:31.330
As you guys crest up on one side

4311
03:17:31.330 --> 03:17:34.210
of the Rainbow Vineyards section, and you can see

4312
03:17:34.210 --> 03:17:38.120
the three story estate of the Lionett family,

4313
03:17:39.190 --> 03:17:40.190
lit from the inside.

4314
03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:43.273
LAURA: Beau.

4315
03:17:46.680 --> 03:17:48.496
Whatever happens,

4316
03:17:50.955 --> 03:17:53.163
he was an asshole for being mean to you.

4317
03:17:54.950 --> 03:17:56.280
You're a wonderful person.

4318
03:18:02.170 --> 03:18:03.890
You're a wonderful person.
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

4319
03:18:03.890 --> 03:18:05.700
You're a wonderful person.

4320
03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:07.800
LAURA: He was lucky to have you for a daughter.

4321
03:18:08.900 --> 03:18:10.780
Hopefully, he will realize that now.

4322
03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:16.060
If he doesn't, remember what you told me.

4323
03:18:17.540 --> 03:18:19.800
Fuck 'em.
MARISHA: (laughs quietly)

4324
03:18:19.800 --> 03:18:23.350
LAURA: You have us, and we love you so much, okay?

4325
03:18:26.230 --> 03:18:30.148
MARISHA: Thanks, Jes, and I give her a hug.

4326
03:18:35.257 --> 03:18:39.472
(exhales) They added an arch.

4327
03:18:40.540 --> 03:18:42.420
It's even more pretentious now.

4328
03:18:42.420 --> 03:18:43.253
Okay, let's go.

4329
03:18:44.474 --> 03:18:46.560
SAM: Do we knock or call or--?

4330
03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:49.030
MATT: There is a heavy gate on the outside,

4331
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:50.220
with the arch in the front gate is,

4332
03:18:50.220 --> 03:18:53.490
it's replaced the familiar entrance to the house.

4333
03:18:55.320 --> 03:18:56.800
There's a little courtyard, where you can see

4334
03:18:56.800 --> 03:18:58.110
there have been some trees

4335
03:18:58.110 --> 03:19:00.490
and bushes that are tended to there.

4336
03:19:01.730 --> 03:19:03.850
The soil within the courtyard is different

4337
03:19:03.850 --> 03:19:07.031
from the soil surrounding, though you can see

4338
03:19:07.031 --> 03:19:10.650
even what's been placed supposedly to try and keep

4339
03:19:10.650 --> 03:19:13.258
the transplanted greenery intact

4340
03:19:13.258 --> 03:19:15.049
is still browning and graying:

4341
03:19:15.049 --> 03:19:17.199
a failed experiment on making

4342
03:19:18.132 --> 03:19:20.924
a nice grounds around their home.

4343
03:19:20.924 --> 03:19:23.332
ASHLEY: Are there any flowers?

4344
03:19:25.190 --> 03:19:26.850
MATT: No.

4345
03:19:26.850 --> 03:19:29.014
This is a flowerless place.

4346
03:19:29.014 --> 03:19:30.303
ASHLEY: I was going to pick all of them.

4347
03:19:30.303 --> 03:19:31.550
(laughter)

4348
03:19:31.550 --> 03:19:34.430
TRAVIS: As we're approaching, is there anyone on the roof,

4349
03:19:34.430 --> 03:19:35.296
guarding the wall?

4350
03:19:35.296 --> 03:19:37.796
MATT: Make a perception check.

4351
03:19:41.260 --> 03:19:42.450
TRAVIS: 10.

4352
03:19:42.450 --> 03:19:45.070
MATT: 10.
(laughter)

4353
03:19:45.070 --> 03:19:47.320
MATT: It's hard to tell at this distance,

4354
03:19:47.320 --> 03:19:49.040
and as the light gets darker,

4355
03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:53.431
at this point, you can sense now from just the slow

4356
03:19:53.431 --> 03:19:56.614
shift in brightness that you're probably

4357
03:19:56.614 --> 03:19:59.397
about half an hour from dusk.

4358
03:19:59.397 --> 03:20:00.988
LIAM: It's all that sulfur snake.

4359
03:20:04.030 --> 03:20:06.430
MATT: But you would know that there's usually,

4360
03:20:07.351 --> 03:20:11.850
at any give point in time, two folks patrolling

4361
03:20:11.850 --> 03:20:13.860
the grounds, just to ensure that nothing happens

4362
03:20:13.860 --> 03:20:15.258
to the family or the business.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4363
03:20:15.258 --> 03:20:16.383
LIAM: Natch.

4364
03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:19.980
MATT: The gate is there. It's locked,

4365
03:20:19.980 --> 03:20:23.827
but you know one of many tricks to get by it.

4366
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:27.140
So you just walk up to the lock.

4367
03:20:29.090 --> 03:20:32.440
We'll say one of the pin materials that you often use

4368
03:20:32.440 --> 03:20:35.540
to keep your hair up, you just quickly (clicking)

4369
03:20:35.540 --> 03:20:37.080
and the lock just goes (squeaking).

4370
03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:38.590
MARISHA: I think I have a lock picking kit.

4371
03:20:38.590 --> 03:20:40.120
MATT: Probably.
MARISHA: I still have one, yeah.

4372
03:20:40.120 --> 03:20:41.864
TALIESIN: The password is swordfish.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4373
03:20:41.864 --> 03:20:45.430
SAM and LAURA: It's always swordfish.

4374
03:20:45.430 --> 03:20:47.180
LIAM: Just give it a condescending look.

4375
03:20:47.180 --> 03:20:50.420
MATT: There is a hitching post just outside,

4376
03:20:50.420 --> 03:20:54.490
or we'll say three hitching posts right there for travelers,

4377
03:20:54.490 --> 03:20:56.030
you can leave the horses there.

4378
03:20:58.570 --> 03:20:59.770
SAM: After you, Beauregard.

4379
03:21:01.650 --> 03:21:04.410
LAURA: If you want us to attack anybody at all,

4380
03:21:04.410 --> 03:21:06.410
just say, "Armadillo."

4381
03:21:06.410 --> 03:21:08.738
MARISHA: "Armadillo." Got it.

4382
03:21:08.738 --> 03:21:11.232
TRAVIS: Armadillo.
LIAM: Armadillo.

4383
03:21:11.232 --> 03:21:12.940
MARISHA: Okay.

4384
03:21:15.090 --> 03:21:15.923
Let's go.

4385
03:21:17.180 --> 03:21:18.710
TRAVIS: Do you want us with you?

4386
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:19.960
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4387
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:22.970
I roll deep. That looks fucking awesome.

4388
03:21:24.050 --> 03:21:26.800
LAURA: You're charge in us. You're the leader of the group.

4389
03:21:26.800 --> 03:21:28.820
Cool, cool, cool?

4390
03:21:28.820 --> 03:21:30.520
MARISHA: It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

4391
03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:32.740
Okay, let's go.

4392
03:21:32.740 --> 03:21:34.040
MATT: Okay.

4393
03:21:34.040 --> 03:21:38.170
As you guys all begin to walk along the central pathway

4394
03:21:38.170 --> 03:21:41.630
where some of the first cobblestones you've seen,

4395
03:21:44.240 --> 03:21:47.390
you glancing at a fork, can see on the second floor,

4396
03:21:47.390 --> 03:21:50.402
there is a railing, and there is a cloaked, hooded figure

4397
03:21:50.402 --> 03:21:52.130
with a crossbow just leaning on the edge,

4398
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:54.810
not aimed at you, but just watches you carefully,

4399
03:21:54.810 --> 03:21:56.640
and intentionally making his presence

4400
03:21:56.640 --> 03:22:00.840
known as you approach, in a way that guards do

4401
03:22:00.840 --> 03:22:03.380
oh so subtly when they're hired hands.

4402
03:22:04.730 --> 03:22:06.480
Coming to the familiar front door,

4403
03:22:06.480 --> 03:22:10.000
you can see there is a bit of a frosted

4404
03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:13.120
glass window, in the front, that gives a little bit

4405
03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:14.370
of light from the inside.

4406
03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:19.515
The heavy metal knocker sits resting, familiar.

4407
03:22:24.109 --> 03:22:26.720
MATT: (heavy knocking)
(laughter)

4408
03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:30.086
MARISHA: It's very close.
(laughter)

4409
03:22:30.086 --> 03:22:31.690
LAURA: And you hear, poof.

4410
03:22:31.690 --> 03:22:33.520
MARISHA: It's on a delay, yeah.

4411
03:22:33.520 --> 03:22:35.643
TRAVIS: We need to change the batteries on my--

4412
03:22:35.643 --> 03:22:36.476
MATT: Yeah.

4413
03:22:36.476 --> 03:22:39.077
TRAVIS: (powering down sounds)

4414
03:22:41.419 --> 03:22:44.743
MATT: A moment passes, and then, you hear the, (clicking)

4415
03:22:44.743 --> 03:22:46.710
(squeaking) and the door opens,

4416
03:22:46.710 --> 03:22:49.133
and you see a woman standing there.

4417
03:22:50.920 --> 03:22:52.761
Probably early 30s,

4418
03:22:53.703 --> 03:22:56.836
hair tied back.

4419
03:22:57.890 --> 03:23:01.180
She's wearing not upper-class clothing,

4420
03:23:01.180 --> 03:23:04.137
more just like a worker or a servant outfit.

4421
03:23:05.660 --> 03:23:06.760
"Hello, can I help you?"

4422
03:23:08.010 --> 03:23:09.880
MARISHA: Do I know who she is?
MATT: You do not recognize her.

4423
03:23:09.880 --> 03:23:11.569
SAM: Is it your mom?
MARISHA: It's not my mom.

4424
03:23:11.569 --> 03:23:13.520
SAM: Oh, okay.
MARISHA: No.

4425
03:23:13.520 --> 03:23:16.628
My mom is way more garish in the way she dresses.

4426
03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:25.010
Is the lady or man of the house here today?

4427
03:23:26.342 --> 03:23:29.942
MATT: "(nervous chuckle) Oh, may I ask who's inquiring?"

4428
03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:34.583
MARISHA: Beauregard Lionett.

4429
03:23:39.810 --> 03:23:41.120
MATT: "Oh! Um.

4430
03:23:43.600 --> 03:23:45.375
"I'm afraid the master is...

4431
03:23:46.875 --> 03:23:48.275
"tending to the vineyards at the moment.

4432
03:23:48.275 --> 03:23:50.160
"He'll probably be back shortly for dinner.

4433
03:23:50.160 --> 03:23:53.350
"But Ms. Lionett is inside.

4434
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:58.615
"Please, please, enter."

4435
03:23:58.615 --> 03:24:00.160
LAURA: Oh, shit.

4436
03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:02.060
MATT: She opens the door.
SAM: What's wrong?

4437
03:24:03.050 --> 03:24:06.840
LAURA: Beau, what if your dad recognizes my voice?

4438
03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:08.840
MARISHA: He probably will.
SAM: Just change your voice.

4439
03:24:08.840 --> 03:24:10.185
LAURA: I'm just going to change my voice.

4440
03:24:10.185 --> 03:24:12.730
MARISHA: I wouldn't worry.
LAURA: I'm just going to make--

4441
03:24:12.730 --> 03:24:16.063
MARISHA: It's fine, yeah, don't worry about it.

4442
03:24:19.230 --> 03:24:21.820
MATT: She steps to the side and

4443
03:24:21.820 --> 03:24:23.290
just nods her head a little bit of like,

4444
03:24:23.290 --> 03:24:25.298
I had no idea, I am so sorry.

4445
03:24:26.450 --> 03:24:30.410
Looking inside, it is warm, it's inviting,

4446
03:24:30.410 --> 03:24:31.720
especially in the cold rain,

4447
03:24:31.720 --> 03:24:34.150
but as you step inside, and kick off your muddy boots

4448
03:24:34.150 --> 03:24:36.290
or not, depending on how you feel about it,

4449
03:24:38.900 --> 03:24:40.330
immediately, here in this foyer area,

4450
03:24:40.330 --> 03:24:43.720
you can see it has a beautiful rustic aesthetic.

4451
03:24:43.720 --> 03:24:48.020
There are antlers on the wall.

4452
03:24:48.020 --> 03:24:52.630
You can see, it's like a dark mahogany wood interior

4453
03:24:52.630 --> 03:24:56.060
lined with a brighter wood used to set

4454
03:24:56.060 --> 03:24:57.350
the walls apart.

4455
03:24:57.350 --> 03:25:00.280
There is a staircase that goes to a second landing

4456
03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:02.310
that wraps around the main foyer area,

4457
03:25:02.310 --> 03:25:05.270
and there is a iron chandelier that sits in the middle

4458
03:25:05.270 --> 03:25:09.420
that is circular with magically-held candles

4459
03:25:09.420 --> 03:25:12.370
that just keep a constant, nice glow there.

4460
03:25:13.250 --> 03:25:15.033
LAURA: This is nice.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4461
03:25:16.690 --> 03:25:18.370
MATT: You can-- the servant closes the door behind you,

4462
03:25:18.370 --> 03:25:20.250
and then, rushes off.

4463
03:25:20.250 --> 03:25:23.477
"Just wait just a moment. (clearing throat)"

4464
03:25:23.477 --> 03:25:24.418
And runs upstairs.

4465
03:25:24.418 --> 03:25:25.526
"Madame?

4466
03:25:25.526 --> 03:25:26.930
"Madame?"

4467
03:25:26.930 --> 03:25:29.930
And you can hear some giggling upstairs.

4468
03:25:32.210 --> 03:25:34.100
She goes and leaves into another room,

4469
03:25:34.100 --> 03:25:35.980
and here's--
MARISHA: I go over to the fireplace.

4470
03:25:35.980 --> 03:25:36.813
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4471
03:25:36.813 --> 03:25:38.913
It's warm, the hearth is burning.

4472
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:45.240
SAM: Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty awful here.

4473
03:25:46.390 --> 03:25:47.460
Right?

4474
03:25:47.460 --> 03:25:48.293
No?

4475
03:25:49.293 --> 03:25:51.250
LIAM: Your family has done all right for themselves.

4476
03:25:53.100 --> 03:25:53.933
LAURA: How you are--

4477
03:25:53.933 --> 03:25:55.578
how are you doing?
SAM: How you are?

4478
03:25:55.578 --> 03:25:58.606
LAURA: How are you are doing?
(laughter)

4479
03:25:58.606 --> 03:26:00.365
SAM: How you are--
TRAVIS: How are y'all doing?

4480
03:26:00.365 --> 03:26:01.540
(laughter)

4481
03:26:01.540 --> 03:26:02.373
LAURA: Huh?

4482
03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:06.160
MATT: "Beauregard!"
(gasping)

4483
03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:08.220
And you all look and turn and partway

4484
03:26:08.220 --> 03:26:11.276
down the stair landing, you see a woman,

4485
03:26:12.476 --> 03:26:14.710
similar, darker olive skin,

4486
03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:19.740
hair put up into this very, very tight bun

4487
03:26:19.740 --> 03:26:23.230
with a bit of ponytail that dangles behind,

4488
03:26:23.230 --> 03:26:26.030
a really, really nice, a really nice dress for just being

4489
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:28.980
casually at the house, but comfortable,

4490
03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:32.700
of a deep green color.

4491
03:26:34.370 --> 03:26:39.370
You can see, she is leaning in a very startled way,

4492
03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:41.620
just looking directly down at Beau.

4493
03:26:43.020 --> 03:26:44.203
MARISHA: Hey, Mom.

4494
03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:50.587
MATT: "I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming."

4495
03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:54.825
MARISHA: Yeah, it's kind of a trend that I have going on.

4496
03:26:56.980 --> 03:26:58.846
MATT: "Well, uh."

4497
03:27:01.090 --> 03:27:03.150
And she heads down the stairs

4498
03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:04.788
at a brisk pace, and approaches,

4499
03:27:04.788 --> 03:27:08.770
and steps up to you, and then, halts,

4500
03:27:08.770 --> 03:27:11.768
unsure how to greet you.

4501
03:27:16.680 --> 03:27:20.740
Gives a somewhat warm, somewhat stilted hug,

4502
03:27:20.740 --> 03:27:22.340
and then pulls back a bit.

4503
03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:25.450
MARISHA: I'm sorry to barge in.

4504
03:27:25.450 --> 03:27:30.450
I know you were wanting to keep me distant

4505
03:27:31.210 --> 03:27:35.380
from the family, but I need to talk to Dad.

4506
03:27:35.380 --> 03:27:38.530
It's important, and then we'll be gone,

4507
03:27:38.530 --> 03:27:40.310
and you don't have to--
MATT: "No, no, you--"

4508
03:27:40.310 --> 03:27:41.310
MARISHA: --fuck with me anymore.
MATT: "You could stay

4509
03:27:41.310 --> 03:27:42.210
"as long as you like.

4510
03:27:42.210 --> 03:27:45.410
"I-- who are your friends here?"

4511
03:27:45.410 --> 03:27:47.380
And you hear a voice from upstairs go like,

4512
03:27:47.380 --> 03:27:49.330
"Mommy?"
TRAVIS: (laughter)

4513
03:27:49.330 --> 03:27:51.110
MATT: And you see, from around the corner,

4514
03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:53.620
the servants trying to catch up to him,

4515
03:27:53.620 --> 03:27:57.250
but you see a young boy, who, in many ways,

4516
03:27:57.250 --> 03:28:00.470
looks like a young, boyish Beauregard,

4517
03:28:00.470 --> 03:28:03.730
longer hair that's in this wild curl,

4518
03:28:03.730 --> 03:28:05.630
looks like he just got out of a shower or something

4519
03:28:05.630 --> 03:28:08.320
and had his head briskly dried.

4520
03:28:08.320 --> 03:28:11.830
He's wearing these baggy pajamas

4521
03:28:11.830 --> 03:28:13.500
that drag just past the fingers,

4522
03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:16.120
and he begins running down the stairs.

4523
03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:17.270
LAURA: Oh, at two?

4524
03:28:17.270 --> 03:28:19.320
Woof.
(laughter)

4525
03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:22.520
Talented kid.
LIAM: Two and a half--

4526
03:28:22.520 --> 03:28:24.500
TALIESIN: Waiting for that.
MATT: Two and a half.

4527
03:28:24.500 --> 03:28:26.544
It's not-- when I say tumbling down the stairs.

4528
03:28:26.544 --> 03:28:29.602
(laughter)
TRAVIS: That sounds right,

4529
03:28:29.602 --> 03:28:30.730
that sounds right.
MATT: Yeah.

4530
03:28:30.730 --> 03:28:32.744
TALIESIN: And restore.
(laughter)

4531
03:28:32.744 --> 03:28:35.570
MATT: There you go.
(laughter)

4532
03:28:35.570 --> 03:28:37.040
MARISHA: They bounce back.
MATT: Yeah.

4533
03:28:37.040 --> 03:28:41.320
No, it's the servant trying to catch up with him,

4534
03:28:41.320 --> 03:28:45.230
and they both come down to join

4535
03:28:45.230 --> 03:28:49.680
as Clara still isn't breaking eye contact

4536
03:28:49.680 --> 03:28:51.940
and she just reaches out and takes your hand,

4537
03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:55.683
and says, "It's good to see you."

4538
03:28:58.400 --> 03:28:59.233
MARISHA: Yeah?

4539
03:29:06.410 --> 03:29:08.641
MATT: "Would you like to stay for dinner?"

4540
03:29:08.641 --> 03:29:12.730
(Jester humming)
TRAVIS: That's most gracious of you.

4541
03:29:12.730 --> 03:29:15.082
We are the Mighty Nein.

4542
03:29:15.082 --> 03:29:18.370
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: We are esteemed friends

4543
03:29:18.370 --> 03:29:22.350
of your daughter.
MATT: "Well, many friends

4544
03:29:22.350 --> 03:29:25.193
"of Beauregard are friends of ours, so..."

4545
03:29:26.650 --> 03:29:28.400
SAM: Hi.
MATT: "Hi."

4546
03:29:28.400 --> 03:29:29.816
SAM: How you are?

4547
03:29:31.433 --> 03:29:35.624
MATT: "(stammers) I'm Clara Lionett,

4548
03:29:36.620 --> 03:29:40.005
"Beauregard's mother, but I assume you know that by now.

4549
03:29:45.920 --> 03:29:49.350
"I'll ensure some places are set."

4550
03:29:49.350 --> 03:29:51.770
MARISHA: Hey, Mom, remember that year we had

4551
03:29:52.940 --> 03:29:55.320
that mud slide that ended up happening,

4552
03:29:55.320 --> 03:29:56.670
and took out half of our stock,

4553
03:29:56.670 --> 03:29:59.490
and we only had a few bottles left from that year?

4554
03:29:59.490 --> 03:30:01.910
MATT: "Yes?"
MARISHA: Will you go grab one of those?

4555
03:30:01.910 --> 03:30:02.743
MATT: "Of course."

4556
03:30:02.743 --> 03:30:05.248
MARISHA: I've been talking about it
a lot, you know, I'd love to--

4557
03:30:05.248 --> 03:30:07.800
MATT: "Yes, yes, yes, of course.

4558
03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:09.515
"Jeanine, could you get one of those bottles?"

4559
03:30:09.515 --> 03:30:13.222
And she goes, "Right away," and then, darts out.

4560
03:30:14.680 --> 03:30:19.110
"Anyway. Oh, my goodness, oh my goodness,

4561
03:30:19.110 --> 03:30:22.980
"I didn't even-- Beauregard," and she turns,

4562
03:30:22.980 --> 03:30:24.810
and you know, clutching the side,

4563
03:30:24.810 --> 03:30:29.470
holding onto the edge, with a big smile, bright eyes,

4564
03:30:29.470 --> 03:30:31.907
the little boy looks up at all of you.

4565
03:30:31.907 --> 03:30:33.346
(as TJ) "Whoa."

4566
03:30:37.280 --> 03:30:38.570
(as Clara) "Thoreau, Jr., I'd like you to meet

4567
03:30:38.570 --> 03:30:41.600
"your older sister, Beauregard.

4568
03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:44.467
"Beauregard, this is Thoreau, Jr."

4569
03:30:49.810 --> 03:30:51.857
(as TJ) "That is sister?"

4570
03:30:51.857 --> 03:30:54.557
(as Clara) "Yes, it's your sister."

4571
03:30:57.223 --> 03:30:59.290
And he walks up to you.

4572
03:31:00.410 --> 03:31:01.903
MARISHA: I crouch down.

4573
03:31:06.659 --> 03:31:08.659
MATT: And he puts his arms around you.

4574
03:31:18.400 --> 03:31:22.120
MARISHA: He has that smell to him,

4575
03:31:25.780 --> 03:31:27.680
like all the fucking kids in Kamordah.

4576
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:31.870
MATT: He pulls back a little bit.

4577
03:31:31.870 --> 03:31:34.460
He's still holding onto you a little bit.

4578
03:31:34.460 --> 03:31:36.160
He's just looking at you,

4579
03:31:36.160 --> 03:31:41.126
and he's just taking you in.

4580
03:31:42.534 --> 03:31:44.075
Clara goes,

4581
03:31:46.450 --> 03:31:51.450
"We were hoping you'd come by sometime, to meet him."

4582
03:31:52.760 --> 03:31:54.584
MARISHA: Did you know--

4583
03:31:56.143 --> 03:32:00.210
The timeline that was always interesting to me.

4584
03:32:00.210 --> 03:32:02.110
Did you know you were pregnant with him

4585
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:05.388
when you sent me away?

4586
03:32:12.859 --> 03:32:14.850
TRAVIS: The mantel is lovely.

4587
03:32:14.850 --> 03:32:18.050
Jester, would you help me over here for a moment,

4588
03:32:18.050 --> 03:32:21.897
Nott, perhaps, everyone, if we could just.

4589
03:32:23.060 --> 03:32:25.133
MARISHA: I lean down to TJ.

4590
03:32:30.510 --> 03:32:32.560
Hey, little man.

4591
03:32:32.560 --> 03:32:33.393
MATT: "Hey."

4592
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:36.360
MARISHA: What's your favorite color?

4593
03:32:41.687 --> 03:32:43.230
(laughter)

4594
03:32:43.230 --> 03:32:46.530
MATT: And he points at his mother's dress.

4595
03:32:46.530 --> 03:32:47.696
MARISHA: Green?

4596
03:32:52.290 --> 03:32:56.780
Well, here, you might, you might like this, then.

4597
03:32:58.138 --> 03:33:01.130
I give him the jade necklace, put it around him.

4598
03:33:04.200 --> 03:33:06.677
Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

4599
03:33:06.677 --> 03:33:08.170
(laughter)

4600
03:33:08.170 --> 03:33:11.090
MARISHA: It's been in some dank places, little man,

4601
03:33:11.090 --> 03:33:14.792
so it'll really build up your immune system.

4602
03:33:14.792 --> 03:33:17.355
(laughter)

4603
03:33:17.355 --> 03:33:19.500
MATT: And he's just looking at you, going,

4604
03:33:19.500 --> 03:33:21.430
and slobber coming off of it.

4605
03:33:21.430 --> 03:33:24.130
TRAVIS: Antibodies.
ASHLEY and LAURA: (like Ronin) Ah, wha.

4606
03:33:24.985 --> 03:33:27.810
LIAM: It tastes like indigo.

4607
03:33:32.072 --> 03:33:35.996
MATT: (as Clara) "Look, Beauregard,

4608
03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:43.220
"things are challenging all around.

4609
03:33:44.670 --> 03:33:46.120
"I didn't--

4610
03:33:47.103 --> 03:33:51.344
"your father didn't mean things to...

4611
03:33:53.782 --> 03:33:56.732
"become so tense

4612
03:33:58.149 --> 03:33:59.557
"when you went away."

4613
03:34:03.359 --> 03:34:06.060
MARISHA: Well, it was a hell of a goodbye, you know?

4614
03:34:11.010 --> 03:34:13.840
I'm not entirely sure why anyone would think

4615
03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:15.234
that that was a good fucking idea

4616
03:34:15.234 --> 03:34:17.040
to handle a situation

4617
03:34:20.810 --> 03:34:22.460
with a daughter that was clearly,

4618
03:34:27.230 --> 03:34:29.613
just wanting your fucking attention.

4619
03:34:36.940 --> 03:34:38.081
MATT: "I'm sorry.

4620
03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:41.960
"I know it doesn't mean much.

4621
03:34:46.100 --> 03:34:49.400
"Your father was under a lot of stress, and...

4622
03:34:54.495 --> 03:34:56.010
"Things should've been handled differently,

4623
03:34:56.010 --> 03:34:59.122
"you're right, you're absolutely right."

4624
03:35:00.850 --> 03:35:01.941
MARISHA: Fuck, Mom.

4625
03:35:05.420 --> 03:35:08.822
So you're just as passive as you were back in the day.

4626
03:35:11.070 --> 03:35:12.937
Did you get that bottle of wine?

4627
03:35:15.790 --> 03:35:19.460
MATT: "Jeanine's--" and you hear the footsteps are coming

4628
03:35:19.460 --> 03:35:21.060
from under the cellar.

4629
03:35:21.060 --> 03:35:22.285
MARISHA: Jeanine!

4630
03:35:24.955 --> 03:35:26.538
MATT: (as Jeanine) "Here's the--"
MARISHA: My hero.

4631
03:35:27.930 --> 03:35:28.813
MATT: Passes the bottle--
MARISHA: Jeanine, Jeanine,

4632
03:35:28.813 --> 03:35:32.372
Jeanine, Jeanine. Thank you, thank you.

4633
03:35:36.580 --> 03:35:37.920
SAM: I'll take care of it.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4634
03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:42.253
It's like a-- it's one of our
most expensive bottles of wine, so enjoy.

4635
03:35:43.319 --> 03:35:46.080
MATT: (thudding) (door creaking)

4636
03:35:46.080 --> 03:35:47.854
SAM: Oh, someone's home.
MATT: The front door opens,

4637
03:35:47.854 --> 03:35:49.779
and you can hear the rain from outside,

4638
03:35:49.779 --> 03:35:51.929
as you see a figure step in

4639
03:35:51.929 --> 03:35:55.230
with a heavy overcoat, hat on,

4640
03:35:55.230 --> 03:35:59.250
step inside, kick off a bit, close the door,

4641
03:35:59.250 --> 03:36:01.930
take the hat and the coat off,

4642
03:36:01.930 --> 03:36:03.630
hang it on the side, and turn,

4643
03:36:05.660 --> 03:36:10.130
and then, as your father looks you directly in the face,

4644
03:36:11.710 --> 03:36:16.280
and immediately just looks like he's seen a ghost.

4645
03:36:24.250 --> 03:36:25.733
"Beauregard."

4646
03:36:31.870 --> 03:36:34.370
MARISHA: Hi.

4647
03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:37.016
MATT: "(nervous chuckling)"

4648
03:36:37.016 --> 03:36:39.910
MARISHA: I'm home.
MATT: "I can see that.

4649
03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:44.910
"I... was not expecting to see you today."

4650
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:46.610
MARISHA: Or ever.
MATT: "Welcome, welcome.

4651
03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:51.193
"Friends of yours, I assume?"

4652
03:36:52.030 --> 03:36:55.300
MARISHA: Ah, yeah, Mom, Dad, this is The Mighty Nein.

4653
03:36:55.300 --> 03:36:57.100
MATT: He looks towards all of you,

4654
03:36:57.100 --> 03:36:59.310
and then looks to Nott, he goes.

4655
03:36:59.310 --> 03:37:00.450
SAM: Hi.

4656
03:37:00.450 --> 03:37:02.118
How you are?
MATT: "Hello."

4657
03:37:02.118 --> 03:37:03.484
LAURA: Why do you keep doing that?!

4658
03:37:03.484 --> 03:37:07.450
MATT: Looks to Clara--
MARISHA: Dad, don't do that, Dad.

4659
03:37:07.450 --> 03:37:08.500
Don't.
MATT: Clara looks back,

4660
03:37:08.500 --> 03:37:12.470
and picks up TJ, and puts him in her arms, and.

4661
03:37:12.470 --> 03:37:15.157
SAM: Oh, it's fine, it's fine.

4662
03:37:15.157 --> 03:37:17.307
MARISHA: Fucking embarrassing.
SAM: Cute kid!

4663
03:37:18.350 --> 03:37:20.755
ASHLEY: He looks very tasty.

4664
03:37:22.580 --> 03:37:24.310
MATT: By this point, TJ is looking right at Nott,

4665
03:37:24.310 --> 03:37:26.740
after seeing, he's like, "Whoa!"

4666
03:37:26.740 --> 03:37:29.540
SAM: Cool, right?
MATT: And Clara's like, "Uh! Hmm!

4667
03:37:30.886 --> 03:37:33.894
"I'm going to go put TJ to-- I'm going to put him down,"

4668
03:37:34.951 --> 03:37:36.350
and then, takes off a little bit,

4669
03:37:36.350 --> 03:37:39.830
and Thoreau steps in a bit.

4670
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:42.060
"Well, it's pleasure to have you all.

4671
03:37:42.060 --> 03:37:45.522
"I am glad you've all been,

4672
03:37:50.769 --> 03:37:52.718
"traveling, I assume."

4673
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:55.300
SAM: Just going to go and start rifling around

4674
03:37:55.300 --> 03:37:56.775
for some cups or something.

4675
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:03.360
MATT: "I have been receiving updates about your work

4676
03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:04.752
"with the Cobalt Soul.

4677
03:38:07.310 --> 03:38:10.127
"Apparently, been doing quite some fine work.

4678
03:38:11.189 --> 03:38:14.280
"I guess I should say Expositor Beauregard?

4679
03:38:16.350 --> 03:38:17.183
"That's incredible.

4680
03:38:17.183 --> 03:38:19.030
"I mean."
MARISHA: Still sending you

4681
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:22.850
those tuition updates, huh?

4682
03:38:22.850 --> 03:38:25.160
MATT: "Well, it's important for us to, you know,

4683
03:38:27.340 --> 03:38:30.220
"make sure we know how our Beauregard's doing."

4684
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:34.355
LIAM: Unparalleled, she is.

4685
03:38:35.280 --> 03:38:36.113
MATT: "Mm-hmm.

4686
03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:38.623
"As she would be."

4687
03:38:40.020 --> 03:38:41.650
LAURA: Insight check.

4688
03:38:41.650 --> 03:38:44.147
I want to know if he seems like he's genuinely proud of her

4689
03:38:44.147 --> 03:38:44.980
or if--

4690
03:38:46.013 --> 03:38:47.304
MATT: Go for it, make an insight check.

4691
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.930
LIAM: Come on, Jessie.

4692
03:38:51.162 --> 03:38:52.437
Roll high.

4693
03:38:52.437 --> 03:38:53.336
LAURA: Ooh!

4694
03:38:53.336 --> 03:38:54.169
SAM: Yeah.

4695
03:38:55.069 --> 03:38:56.960
LAURA: What is that, 23?

4696
03:38:56.960 --> 03:38:58.310
MATT: 23!

4697
03:38:59.468 --> 03:39:03.340
SAM: Wow. Whispers, whispers.

4698
03:39:03.340 --> 03:39:04.389
ASHLEY: Whispers.

4699
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:06.915
SAM: This is intense family drama

4700
03:39:06.915 --> 03:39:08.873
that you'll only get,

4701
03:39:08.873 --> 03:39:11.380
you only get thanks to Hero Forge.

4702
03:39:11.380 --> 03:39:13.470
(laughter)

4703
03:39:13.470 --> 03:39:15.600
Hero Forge, makers or minis and also,

4704
03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:18.890
supporters of intense family dramas.

4705
03:39:20.240 --> 03:39:23.910
Travis is-- both of his fingers are in his nose right now.

4706
03:39:23.910 --> 03:39:26.440
MARISHA: The allergies are really bad right now.
SAM: What do you mean, allergies?

4707
03:39:26.440 --> 03:39:30.512
It's winter. There's no allergies.
LIAM: We all experience emotions in our own way.

4708
03:39:30.512 --> 03:39:33.720
TRAVIS: Late at night, my nose goes. I don't know what--

4709
03:39:33.720 --> 03:39:34.857
blame the internet.

4710
03:39:34.857 --> 03:39:36.360
SAM: Because the cocaine wears off.

4711
03:39:38.006 --> 03:39:38.964
You need more.

4712
03:39:38.964 --> 03:39:40.603
LIAM: Now they know our secret.
SAM: That's right.

4713
03:39:40.603 --> 03:39:41.460
TRAVIS: It's Adderall.

4714
03:39:42.941 --> 03:39:45.710
MARISHA: Good hit, man.
MATT: (sighing)

4715
03:39:47.116 --> 03:39:49.600
LIAM: Now we're back in.
SAM: Found a couple cups.

4716
03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:51.241
MARISHA: Oh, thank you.

4717
03:39:53.299 --> 03:39:54.820
TALIESIN: For this, I will try a sip.

4718
03:39:54.820 --> 03:39:56.732
SAM: Ooh, here you go.

4719
03:39:56.732 --> 03:39:59.370
MATT: "Well, I,

4720
03:40:01.490 --> 03:40:04.437
"a toast to Expositor Beauregard Lionett."

4721
03:40:06.060 --> 03:40:06.893
TRAVIS: Cheers.

4722
03:40:15.284 --> 03:40:16.700
MATT: "I--

4723
03:40:18.318 --> 03:40:22.795
"I know you well enough, Beauregard, to assume you

03:40:22.795 --> 03:40:27.303
"haven't come for the sake of pleasantries."

4725
03:40:32.590 --> 03:40:35.260
LAURA: I just go up and stand next to Beau,

4726
03:40:35.260 --> 03:40:37.120
and put my hand on her back,

4727
03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:40.447
and I'm going to whisper in her ear.

4728
03:40:40.447 --> 03:40:42.030
Do you want us to stay?

4729
03:40:43.468 --> 03:40:45.918
MARISHA: Please.
LAURA: Okay.

4730
03:40:51.050 --> 03:40:52.875
MARISHA: Yep, you know me, Dad.

4731
03:40:52.875 --> 03:40:55.073
I wouldn't be here if I didn't want something.

4732
03:40:59.096 --> 03:41:00.763
LAURA: I shoot him a look.

4733
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:04.080
MARISHA: Listen, that story that you love to tell,

4734
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:07.250
at every family gathering,

4735
03:41:08.460 --> 03:41:12.023
and for bedtime, and any chance you had,

4736
03:41:12.920 --> 03:41:16.053
that old hag that you talked about,

4737
03:41:17.528 --> 03:41:19.103
we need to find her.

4738
03:41:20.931 --> 03:41:22.760
MATT: "(chuckling)"

4739
03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:26.876
MARISHA: Is that story even real,
or was that just meant to terrify me?

4740
03:41:29.393 --> 03:41:32.201
MATT: "Uh-- (quickly swallows wine)"

4741
03:41:33.142 --> 03:41:35.033
He finishes his drink and sets it down.

4742
03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:42.770
"Of course it's real, Beauregard.

4743
03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:48.350
"Look, I know you--

4744
03:41:50.090 --> 03:41:51.740
"I know we've had our differences.

4745
03:41:56.050 --> 03:41:57.566
"And I've not--

4746
03:41:58.824 --> 03:42:03.357
"I've not been the pinnacle of a father,

4747
03:42:03.357 --> 03:42:04.630
"in the same way that you've not been

4748
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:05.880
"a pinnacle of a daughter.

4749
03:42:08.620 --> 03:42:11.100
"I accept my responsibilities in the things that I've,

4750
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:14.697
"maybe been a bit harsh on.

4751
03:42:17.196 --> 03:42:18.880
"But look what you've become."

4752
03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:29.923
MARISHA: It feels like a weird justification

4753
03:42:29.923 --> 03:42:33.923
of your behaviors, but I'd like to hope

4754
03:42:33.923 --> 03:42:36.890
that what I became had nothing to fucking do with you,

4755
03:42:36.890 --> 03:42:39.048
but maybe I'd be lying to myself.

4756
03:42:45.680 --> 03:42:47.412
Yeah, I was difficult.

4757
03:42:49.034 --> 03:42:52.617
I have my onus in everything that happened.

4758
03:42:56.070 --> 03:43:00.420
But I thought a dad was supposed to stay by their kid

4759
03:43:00.420 --> 03:43:03.173
when they're having a fucking hard time.

4760
03:43:08.644 --> 03:43:10.330
MATT: His eyes get--
MARISHA: Mom already fucking

4761
03:43:10.330 --> 03:43:13.590
mentioned that life gets difficult and it's hard.

4762
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.863
So you're right.

4763
03:43:20.863 --> 03:43:22.850
Maybe it's easy to justify the easy way out,

4764
03:43:23.970 --> 03:43:25.887
just get rid of the problem.

4765
03:43:27.010 --> 03:43:28.660
MATT: "That's not what this was about.

4766
03:43:31.570 --> 03:43:33.470
"You were on the self-destructive path.

4767
03:43:35.020 --> 03:43:36.290
"We didn't know what to do.

4768
03:43:36.290 --> 03:43:37.190
"I've never been a--

4769
03:43:41.230 --> 03:43:45.150
"no one teaches you how to be a good father.

4770
03:43:53.834 --> 03:43:55.420
"I regret choices I've made,

4771
03:43:55.420 --> 03:44:00.420
"and you don't think I don't hold myself responsible for--

4772
03:44:07.270 --> 03:44:10.600
"I thought I was doing what was best for you, truly."

4773
03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:14.513
MARISHA: You did.

4774
03:44:16.645 --> 03:44:18.860
It was probably the best thing you could've done for me.

4775
03:44:18.860 --> 03:44:20.368
So thank you.

4776
03:44:33.180 --> 03:44:35.538
Tell me the story again, and then I'll go.

4777
03:44:48.520 --> 03:44:49.353
MATT: "It's true.

4778
03:44:52.674 --> 03:44:56.030
"I haven't lied to you or made anything up.

4779
03:44:56.030 --> 03:44:57.863
"Why are you asking about this?"

4780
03:45:06.060 --> 03:45:07.930
MARISHA: She has information we need.

4781
03:45:12.180 --> 03:45:15.113
MATT: "You're trying to actually go to her?"

4782
03:45:17.800 --> 03:45:19.008
MARISHA: We need her.

4783
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:22.228
MATT: "What for?"

4784
03:45:33.600 --> 03:45:34.908
MARISHA: Why are you afraid?

4785
03:45:35.825 --> 03:45:37.933
MATT: "I'm not afraid, I'm just curious."

4786
03:45:40.603 --> 03:45:41.844
MARISHA: Um--

4787
03:45:43.930 --> 03:45:47.417
We think she has something to do with why--

4788
03:45:50.710 --> 03:45:53.410
LAURA: (southern accent) We needed to break a curse.

4789
03:45:53.410 --> 03:45:57.427
That's all.
(laughter)

4790
03:45:57.427 --> 03:45:58.970
MATT: Damn it.

4791
03:45:58.970 --> 03:46:02.370
MARISHA: Judy Garland just showed up. (laughs)

4792
03:46:06.620 --> 03:46:10.160
SAM: Your daughter's trying to do what she always does,

4793
03:46:10.160 --> 03:46:11.626
help a friend.

4794
03:46:18.640 --> 03:46:23.180
MATT: "Well, I mean, I've just heard the stories

4795
03:46:26.090 --> 03:46:30.230
"growing up about the witch in the mountains."

4796
03:46:30.230 --> 03:46:31.230
MARISHA: What was her name?

4797
03:46:32.580 --> 03:46:33.413
MATT: "I don't remember.

4798
03:46:33.413 --> 03:46:34.920
"She was just 'the witch in the mountains.'

4799
03:46:41.710 --> 03:46:43.260
"Beau, you know how I grew up.

4800
03:46:43.260 --> 03:46:44.788
"We had nothing.

4801
03:46:44.788 --> 03:46:47.446
"I was in the street, I had nothing else to lose.

4802
03:46:50.668 --> 03:46:54.260
"I mean, if I was lucky, this would work.

4803

"If I was not quite as lucky,

4804
03:46:55.720 --> 03:46:58.357
"she would've just chopped me up and eaten me.

03:46:58.357 --> 03:47:00.507
"I didn't have anything else waiting for me.

4806
03:47:05.379 --> 03:47:06.704
"So I--

4807
03:47:09.883 --> 03:47:13.050
"I went and just wandered north,

"through the mountains, through the forests,

"and my shoes began to split,

4810

"and I was chased by wolves and worse,

"until eventually, one day, I just stumbled

"Right when I began to think it was all a lie,

"and I had thrown myself to the wolves for nothing,

"and hungry eyes, and--"

4818
03:47:57.417 --> 03:47:59.330
LAURA: Did she have long arms?

4819
03:48:04.620 --> 03:48:06.020
MATT: "Longer than natural, yeah.

4820
03:48:10.777 --> 03:48:13.694
"And she asked me how I'd come here,

4821
03:48:15.384 --> 03:48:17.510
"I threw myself so withered before her,

4822
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:19.840
"and I said I had nothing to lose.

4823
03:48:21.260 --> 03:48:24.135
"And heard that she can help people.

4824
03:48:27.990 --> 03:48:30.233
"She said she could.

4825
03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:33.900
"She said she was a fortune teller.

"She said fortune was her specialty.

4827
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:47.103
"And so she threw her runes, and played her cards,

4828
03:48:50.339 --> 03:48:52.680
"and said that

4829

"there was a way to get what I always wanted

"for just a fragment of...

"my fortune,

"and I said, 'Well, I don't have a fortune.'

03:49:10.170 --> 03:49:13.528
She said, 'Not that fortune,

"I said, this woman I wanted to marry

"And so, (sighing)

4840
03:49:46.820 --> 03:49:48.770
"she said I'll be a great craftsman,

03:49:50.250 --> 03:49:52.033
"working in fine spirits,

4842
03:49:53.570 --> 03:49:55.520
"to pick a place in the mountain land,

4843

"and wherever I picked,

"will humble me by that which I desired most.

you know,

he looks like he's telling the truth, Beau.

4886
03:54:05.340 --> 03:54:07.120
Obviously, he was terrible to you.

4887

Obviously, they did terrible things,

4888
03:54:08.920 --> 03:54:11.120
and they sent you away, and that's horrible.

03:54:13.250 --> 03:54:17.302
But I do believe they love you, I do,

4890
03:54:23.032 --> 03:54:24.680
and I don't expect you to forgive them

4891
03:54:24.680 --> 03:54:26.755
right away, by any means.

4892
03:54:33.730 --> 03:54:36.242
But I would just encourage to maybe,

4893
03:54:37.950 --> 03:54:42.520
maybe listen to them the way you listened to us,

4894
03:54:44.160 --> 03:54:45.490
with open ears.

4895
03:54:50.230 --> 03:54:52.338
MARISHA: How did you do it?

4896
03:54:52.338 --> 03:54:53.570
LAURA: Do what?

4897
03:54:53.570 --> 03:54:55.719
MARISHA: Forgive your dad so quickly.

4898
03:54:59.927 --> 03:55:01.236
LAURA: Well,

4899
03:55:04.448 --> 03:55:08.598
I mean, he seemed pretty earnest,

4900
03:55:10.031 --> 03:55:10.864
and

4901
03:55:12.826 --> 03:55:17.492
there's not a lot to be gained from holding grudges.

4902
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:21.370
You know, it feels like poison inside of you.

4903
03:55:23.200 --> 03:55:27.000
How much better would it feel if you could just

4904
03:55:28.191 --> 03:55:29.649
be clean?

4905
03:55:32.680 --> 03:55:34.614
MARISHA: Bu I'm so good at holding grudges.

4906
03:55:34.614 --> 03:55:36.656
LAURA: I know, you're really good at it.

4907
03:55:44.668 --> 03:55:48.001
MARISHA: You make an interesting point, though.

4908
03:55:55.410 --> 03:55:58.780
I walk back over.
LIAM: This is an excellent wine.

4909
03:56:00.420 --> 03:56:01.340
MATT: "Well, looking at the bottle,

4910
03:56:01.340 --> 03:56:05.700
"it's an extremely rare one, that I would've preferred

4911
03:56:05.700 --> 03:56:06.580
"to have kept in the cellar,

4912
03:56:06.580 --> 03:56:09.740
"but it's a special occasion, so enjoy it."

4913
03:56:09.740 --> 03:56:12.082
LIAM: The most special occasion, a reunion.

4914
03:56:12.082 --> 03:56:13.532
(clearing throat) Beauregard.

4915
03:56:24.494 --> 03:56:26.994
MARISHA: I'm going to go find this woman

4916
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:32.260
that you based so much of our entire lives around,

4917
03:56:43.420 --> 03:56:45.270
and hope that I can better understand

4918
03:56:49.020 --> 03:56:51.407
why and where you're coming from,

4919
03:56:54.753 --> 03:56:56.003
because

4920
03:56:58.707 --> 03:57:03.210
while you and Mom didn't do a lot

4921
03:57:03.210 --> 03:57:06.207
of the footwork into understanding me,

4922
03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:13.018
it doesn't mean

4923
03:57:13.018 --> 03:57:16.240
that I can't do my research

4924
03:57:16.240 --> 03:57:18.690
to better understand where I came from.

4925
03:57:24.352 --> 03:57:29.317
I've done a lot to reflect on

4926
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:34.250
what choices I've made to put me

4927
03:57:34.250 --> 03:57:35.650
in the position that I'm in.

4928
03:57:40.730 --> 03:57:42.730
And I guess I'm just mildly disappointed

4929
03:57:45.200 --> 03:57:47.800
to see that the same amount of work hasn't been done

4930
03:57:49.220 --> 03:57:54.133
or at least even remotely attempted.

4931
03:57:56.770 --> 03:57:59.650
MATT: "That's not entirely true, Beauregard.

4932
03:58:05.870 --> 03:58:07.620
"Not entirely wrong, either."

4933
03:58:17.524 --> 03:58:20.774
MARISHA: I gave Thoreau Jr. the jade necklace.

4934
03:58:22.720 --> 03:58:25.470
Make sure he doesn't choke on it.

4935
03:58:29.850 --> 03:58:34.850
MATT: "Well, then don't, don't leave and go to this woman

4936
03:58:34.900 --> 03:58:36.750
"without any sort of protection.

4937
03:58:36.750 --> 03:58:39.530
"Hold on just a second," and he nervously

4938
03:58:39.530 --> 03:58:43.920
runs past you, and heads off into one of the side chambers.

4939
03:58:45.640 --> 03:58:47.890
SAM: You're doing great, you're doing amazing.

4940
03:58:47.890 --> 03:58:49.590
LAURA: You've done a really good job, Beau.

4941
03:58:49.590 --> 03:58:51.070
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: We all are here with you.

4942
03:58:51.070 --> 03:58:53.340
SAM: Question, protection?

4943
03:58:53.340 --> 03:58:54.520
He thinks that protects you?

4944
03:58:54.520 --> 03:58:56.750
MARISHA: I told you he was incredibly superstitious.

4945
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:57.738
LAURA: We never checked it out, though.

4946
03:58:57.738 --> 03:58:59.561
It might've been protective,

4947
03:58:59.561 --> 03:59:01.463
or really valuable, I don't know.

4948
03:59:01.463 --> 03:59:03.978
TALIESIN: Detect Good and Evil.

4949
03:59:03.978 --> 03:59:06.961
MATT: Okay, Detect Good and Evil.

4950
03:59:06.961 --> 03:59:08.019
LIAM: Fireball.

4951
03:59:08.019 --> 03:59:11.128
(laughter)

4952
03:59:11.128 --> 03:59:12.411
ASHLEY: Necrotic Shroud.

4953
03:59:12.411 --> 03:59:15.211
(laughter)

4954
03:59:16.873 --> 03:59:18.010
TALIESIN: I'm curious if this is a guy

4955
03:59:18.010 --> 03:59:20.560
who's had things blessed, cursed.

4956
03:59:20.560 --> 03:59:22.800
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: How superstitious is he

4957
03:59:22.800 --> 03:59:24.320
in this house, how fearful is he?

4958
03:59:25.187 --> 03:59:26.462
MATT: Okay.

4959
03:59:26.462 --> 03:59:29.531
Well, Detect Good and Evil, all right.

4960
03:59:29.531 --> 03:59:30.364
TALIESIN: I know.

4961
03:59:30.364 --> 03:59:31.905
I'm going to do a Detect Magic on top of it.

4962
03:59:31.905 --> 03:59:32.980
MATT: Okay.

4963
03:59:32.980 --> 03:59:34.790
He rushes back in, and in his hands,

4964
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:37.970
and you can see a different design,

4965
03:59:37.970 --> 03:59:42.040
but there is another tighter jade necklace,

4966
03:59:42.040 --> 03:59:45.140
different carvings, he rushes over and he goes,

4967
03:59:46.050 --> 03:59:50.590
"This is your mother's, but just please, please, for me,

4968
03:59:50.590 --> 03:59:54.400
"if you're going to do this. (sighs)"

4969
03:59:54.400 --> 03:59:56.533
MARISHA: Always good to have an upgrade.

4970
03:59:59.850 --> 04:00:02.070
MATT: You don't sense anything on the list.

4971
04:00:03.370 --> 04:00:06.170
TALIESIN: Detect Magic, just for fun, too, for the room,

4972
04:00:06.170 --> 04:00:07.430
for everything.
MATT: Okay.

4973
04:00:07.430 --> 04:00:09.780
And the lights above, definitely.

4974
04:00:11.460 --> 04:00:12.730
You know, the equipment you're wearing.

4975
04:00:12.730 --> 04:00:14.957
The necklace he's granting is not magical.

4976
04:00:14.957 --> 04:00:15.790
LAURA: Mm.

4977
04:00:17.507 --> 04:00:19.244
LIAM: It's super special, though.

4978
04:00:19.244 --> 04:00:20.077
MATT: Yeah.

4979
04:00:22.320 --> 04:00:23.740
He just, as he grabs your hands,

4980
04:00:23.740 --> 04:00:28.073
handing it to you, withdraws and recomposes himself.

4981
04:00:38.410 --> 04:00:39.551
"I only hope,

4982
04:00:48.160 --> 04:00:51.252
"I hope I can make up to you the missteps

4983
04:00:52.900 --> 04:00:54.550
"that I can plainly see behind me.

4984
04:00:58.170 --> 04:01:02.408
"It's rare that a child's damage at that age

4985
04:01:04.356 --> 04:01:05.189
"and

4986
04:01:09.851 --> 04:01:11.601
"behavior

4987
04:01:14.009 --> 04:01:16.484
"doesn't reflect how I,

4988
04:01:20.538 --> 04:01:21.371
"hmm,

4989
04:01:22.412 --> 04:01:24.829
"misstepped in my parenting."

4990
04:01:33.781 --> 04:01:36.164
MARISHA: Thank you for that.

4991
04:01:41.050 --> 04:01:44.691
MATT: "Your grandfather was no peach, either,

4992
04:01:46.033 --> 04:01:47.958
"and there's,

4993
04:01:52.340 --> 04:01:55.178
"there's difficulty in realizing

4994
04:01:58.480 --> 04:02:02.778
"how much you intended to be different,

4995
04:02:05.460 --> 04:02:09.697
"and then to realize you've become so similar.

4996
04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:17.790
"So I hope with the company you keep,

4997
04:02:19.430 --> 04:02:22.580
"maybe you won't repeat the same mistakes I have,

4998
04:02:26.370 --> 04:02:27.990
"by treating the people around you."

4999
04:02:33.190 --> 04:02:34.815
MARISHA: I'm trying to do better.

5000
04:02:40.020 --> 04:02:41.960
I'll let you know how it goes.

5001
04:02:41.960 --> 04:02:42.793
MATT: "Good, good."

5002
04:02:48.840 --> 04:02:49.900
LAURA: Are we staying, are we going--

5003
04:02:49.900 --> 04:02:51.450
MATT: "Are you staying for dinner?"

5004
04:02:51.450 --> 04:02:55.050
LAURA: What exactly are we doing?
SAM: We'll leave now, yeah?

5005
04:02:55.050 --> 04:02:57.383
MARISHA: We should go.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

5006
04:02:58.570 --> 04:02:59.617
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

5007
04:02:59.617 --> 04:03:03.700
MARISHA: Tell Mom thank you.

5008
04:03:05.760 --> 04:03:07.150
Mom!

5009
04:03:07.150 --> 04:03:10.070
MATT: You look back and she's actually looking out

5010
04:03:10.070 --> 04:03:13.000
past the doorway, and darts behind,

5011
04:03:13.000 --> 04:03:14.550
and then walks out.

5012
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:15.383
(as Clara) "Yes?"

5013
04:03:18.970 --> 04:03:21.350
MARISHA: I'm going, Mom.
MATT: "Oh.

5014
04:03:22.450 --> 04:03:24.750
"Oh, all right,"

5015
04:03:26.066 --> 04:03:30.900
and she reaches behind, and pulls TJ behind her.

5016
04:03:30.900 --> 04:03:34.458
You see he like comes up alongside her,

5017
04:03:35.694 --> 04:03:38.730
and she walks up to you, and hands TJ over

5018
04:03:38.730 --> 04:03:41.870
to your father, and takes your hand,

5019
04:03:49.520 --> 04:03:51.703
"I'm sorry things,

5020
04:03:53.086 --> 04:03:57.705
"things are strained tonight,

5021
04:03:57.705 --> 04:03:58.955
"but it's good to see you."

5022
04:04:03.180 --> 04:04:05.322
MARISHA: I just lean in and I whisper:

5023
04:04:09.180 --> 04:04:11.720
You're allowed to have an opinion, too, Mom.

5024
04:04:19.545 --> 04:04:22.330
I'll let you know how it goes.

5025
04:04:22.330 --> 04:04:23.163
MATT: "Of course,"

5026
04:04:24.900 --> 04:04:27.897
and she squeezes your hand and lets go,

5027
04:04:28.770 --> 04:04:32.160
and then, she looks over,

5028
04:04:32.160 --> 04:04:34.920
and TJ comes up again.

5029
04:04:34.920 --> 04:04:37.020
He looks up at you, and holds the necklace back up again

5030
04:04:37.020 --> 04:04:38.820
and starts sucking on it again, and Clara's like,

5031
04:04:38.820 --> 04:04:43.260
"No, no, honey.

5032
04:04:52.390 --> 04:04:53.340
"No, no, no, no, no!"

5033
04:04:57.324 --> 04:04:58.430
And your dad turns to you.

5034
04:05:00.310 --> 04:05:02.820
"Be safe."

5035
04:05:04.860 --> 04:05:06.712
MARISHA: I will, I promise.

5036
04:05:09.380 --> 04:05:12.650
MATT: "Keep her safe."
LAURA: Always.

5037
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:14.160
TALIESIN: Of course.

5038
04:05:14.160 --> 04:05:16.910
LAURA: You want to give her an awkward hug or anything?

5039
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:19.560
You know she's going to face a pretty powerful being.

5040
04:05:20.551 --> 04:05:23.580
MARISHA: I think we're good.
MATT: "Right."

5041
04:05:23.580 --> 04:05:24.540
LAURA: Okay, just checking.

5042
04:05:24.540 --> 04:05:25.890
SAM: Good luck to you, too.

5043
04:05:25.890 --> 04:05:27.698
MARISHA: Any landmarks to look out for?

5044
04:05:29.900 --> 04:05:32.140
MATT: "If you hear noise, run.

5045
04:05:35.225 --> 04:05:39.608
"There was a thick,

5046
04:05:39.608 --> 04:05:43.733
"bramble tangle,

5047
04:05:44.690 --> 04:05:47.450
"partially grayed and petrified like many

5048
04:05:47.450 --> 04:05:49.040
"of the woods there.

5049
04:05:49.960 --> 04:05:51.160
"That means you're close.

5050
04:05:52.810 --> 04:05:56.445
"If the ground begins to tar, it looks like,

5051
04:05:57.360 --> 04:05:58.360
"you're almost there.

5052
04:06:00.960 --> 04:06:04.443
"And if I recall, it's

5053
04:06:04.443 --> 04:06:08.026
"pretty straight north from here."

5054
04:06:11.917 --> 04:06:12.750
MARISHA: All right.

5055
04:06:12.750 --> 04:06:17.610
LAURA: Should we take horses there, or should we go on foot?

5056
04:06:17.610 --> 04:06:19.090
MATT: "You can take horses as far as you want,

5057
04:06:19.090 --> 04:06:20.770
"but there'll be a point where you won't be able

5058
04:06:20.770 --> 04:06:22.610
"to bring them with you."

5059
04:06:22.610 --> 04:06:24.610
LAURA: Maybe we should leave the horses here?

5060
04:06:24.610 --> 04:06:27.303
SAM: We'll take them a bit.
LAURA: All right.

5061
04:06:27.303 --> 04:06:31.304
(laughter)

5062
04:06:31.304 --> 04:06:33.862
SAM: Oh, you care about horses just a little bit.

5063
04:06:36.698 --> 04:06:39.245
MATT: "The Mighty Nein,

5064
04:06:39.245 --> 04:06:40.710
"it's been a pleasure having you.

5065
04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:45.710
"Welcome to the Lionett Estate, and

5066
04:06:45.726 --> 04:06:49.670
"travel safe. We look forward to seeing you here again."

5067
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:51.503
SAM: And you, too.

5068
04:06:51.503 --> 04:06:53.490
Many years ago, I was granted a wish

5069
04:06:53.490 --> 04:06:56.500
by that same witch, and I turned into this

5070
04:06:56.500 --> 04:06:59.545
as a result, so I hope that doesn't happen to you.

5071
04:06:59.545 --> 04:07:01.470
(laughter)

5072
04:07:01.470 --> 04:07:03.935
Bye.
MARISHA: Bye, Dad.

5073
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:08.730
I swipe another bottle of wine that they have on display

5074
04:07:08.730 --> 04:07:09.563
on the way out.

5075
04:07:09.563 --> 04:07:11.707
SAM: And I will steal literally anything.

5076
04:07:11.707 --> 04:07:14.298
(laughter)

5077
04:07:14.298 --> 04:07:15.820
If I don't see anything on the way out,

5078
04:07:15.820 --> 04:07:18.040
I'll just take the cup I was drinking.

5079
04:07:18.040 --> 04:07:19.670
MATT: The cup you still have, definitely.

5080
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:20.503
It's a nice cup.

5081
04:07:21.592 --> 04:07:24.563
On the way out, there are these small,

5082
04:07:26.500 --> 04:07:28.700
square windows off to each side

5083
04:07:28.700 --> 04:07:31.690
of the entryway, and they have these little,

5084
04:07:31.690 --> 04:07:34.560
decorative tables with nice velvet over them,

5085
04:07:34.560 --> 04:07:36.540
and you can see there's a couple of art pieces there

5086
04:07:36.540 --> 04:07:38.770
that are relatively easy to grab.

5087
04:07:38.770 --> 04:07:40.960
SAM: I'll grab one.
MATT: Doing it stealthily or--

5088
04:07:40.960 --> 04:07:43.520
SAM: Stealthily.
MATT: Roll sleight of hand.

5089
04:07:43.520 --> 04:07:45.095
SAM: (nervous noise)

5090
04:07:45.095 --> 04:07:47.017
28.

5091
04:07:47.017 --> 04:07:49.133
TALIESIN: I am so disappointed.

5092
04:07:49.133 --> 04:07:51.710
MATT: You glance down, and it's this beautiful

5093
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:55.950
jade rabbit sculpture.

5094
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:57.600
SAM: When our friend gets out of the shitter,

5095
04:07:57.600 --> 04:07:59.171
tell him to meet us outside.

5096
04:07:59.171 --> 04:08:02.901
(laughter)

5097
04:08:02.901 --> 04:08:05.066
ASHLEY: I'm just going to linger and hang back.

5098
04:08:05.066 --> 04:08:07.408
(laughter)

5099
04:08:07.408 --> 04:08:09.140
I'm one of the last ones to walk out.

5100
04:08:09.140 --> 04:08:09.973
MATT: Okay.

5101
04:08:12.780 --> 04:08:15.680
Thoreau approaches to close the door behind.

5102
04:08:18.730 --> 04:08:20.640
ASHLEY: You should be very proud of your daughter.

5103
04:08:21.750 --> 04:08:23.300
You are very lucky to have her.

5104
04:08:25.079 --> 04:08:25.912
MATT: "I agree."

5105
04:08:29.085 --> 04:08:30.810
ASHLEY: You should show her that more, then.

5106
04:08:34.350 --> 04:08:38.690
If, for some reason, we end up killing this hag,

5107
04:08:38.690 --> 04:08:40.420
will all of this go away?

5108
04:08:47.280 --> 04:08:49.538
MATT: "I don't know."

5109
04:08:49.538 --> 04:08:50.813
ASHLEY: Well.

5110
04:08:53.008 --> 04:08:55.841
Maybe that would help you remember what's important.

5111
04:08:57.300 --> 04:08:58.525
Have a good night.

5112
04:09:01.120 --> 04:09:02.390
MATT: As you leave, he just stands there

5113
04:09:02.390 --> 04:09:04.930
with the door open, watching you all walk away,

5114
04:09:04.930 --> 04:09:08.430
those words still echoing through his ears

5115
04:09:08.430 --> 04:09:13.358
before the door slowly (clicking).

5116
04:09:13.358 --> 04:09:14.870
TRAVIS: (whispering) Orphan Maker.

5117
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:18.090
MATT: As you all--
(laughter)

5118
04:09:18.090 --> 04:09:22.460
As you all step back out into the cold night rain.

5119
04:09:22.460 --> 04:09:27.108
The sun now set, the sky darkened beneath the storm clouds,

5120
04:09:27.108 --> 04:09:29.530
as another distant flash of lightning

5121
04:09:29.530 --> 04:09:34.530
brings the calming thunder to your ears, Yasha.

5122
04:09:34.900 --> 04:09:37.550
MARISHA: I cry a little bit, and then, just grab everybody,

5123
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:38.640
and huddle everybody in.

5124
04:09:38.640 --> 04:09:40.160
LAURA: Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug.

5125
04:09:40.160 --> 04:09:44.340
MATT: You all come in for a cold, rainy hug here in the mud,

5126
04:09:44.340 --> 04:09:48.660
on the outskirts on the Lionett Estate, here in Kamordah,

5127
04:09:49.530 --> 04:09:52.450
a union of support.

5128
04:09:52.450 --> 04:09:53.350
MARISHA: Yeah, it's good.

5129
04:09:55.210 --> 04:09:57.120
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

5130
04:09:57.120 --> 04:09:58.740
ASHLEY: Ooh.
TALIESIN: (snapping)

5131
04:09:58.740 --> 04:10:01.570
MATT: Man, whoa.

5132
04:10:01.570 --> 04:10:03.900
ASHLEY: Oof.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5133
04:10:03.900 --> 04:10:06.950
LAURA: Totally where you expected it to go, right?

5134
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:08.030
MATT: Totally expected.

5135
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:09.400
MARISHA: It was a good show.

5136
04:10:10.390 --> 04:10:12.290
MATT: I've had all these battle maps

5137
04:10:12.290 --> 04:10:13.810
for all the different direction

5138
04:10:13.810 --> 04:10:15.980
for a lot of this, and I don't care.

5139
04:10:15.980 --> 04:10:18.480
This has all been a great fucking role play, man.

5140
04:10:18.480 --> 04:10:20.040
LIAM: Travis, Travis, when you were gone,

5141
04:10:20.040 --> 04:10:24.370
was Fjord's stool solid or runnier, or?

5142
04:10:24.370 --> 04:10:25.746
MATT: Stony.
LIAM: Stony?

5143
04:10:25.746 --> 04:10:28.360
(groaning)
(laughter)

5144
04:10:28.360 --> 04:10:30.995
TALIESIN: Vegan milkshake stony, like that level.

5145
04:10:30.995 --> 04:10:33.022
Yeah. It's a rough time.

5146
04:10:34.487 --> 04:10:36.238
SAM: Wow, guys, wow.

5147
04:10:37.894 --> 04:10:39.400
MARISHA: My eyes were puffy.
LAURA: Yeah.

5148
04:10:39.400 --> 04:10:40.920
MATT: I can't imagine why.

5149
04:10:40.920 --> 04:10:41.870
LAURA: You're going to be exhausted.

5150
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:43.400
MARISHA: I'm going to sleep so good.

5151
04:10:43.400 --> 04:10:46.380
MATT: Man, it's so weird playing your asshole dad.

5152
04:10:46.380 --> 04:10:47.390
LAURA: Yeah, it's kind of creepy.

5153
04:10:47.390 --> 04:10:52.390
MATT: It's a very strange disassociation exercise.

5154
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:54.783
LIAM: I hope so.
MATT: Oh yeah.

5155
04:10:54.783 --> 04:10:58.699
(laughter)

5156
04:10:58.699 --> 04:10:59.757
Touché.

5157
04:11:01.770 --> 04:11:03.440
Man.

5158
04:11:03.440 --> 04:11:04.614
Well, thank you guys for joining us.

5159
04:11:04.614 --> 04:11:06.900
(cheering)
(laughter)

5160
04:11:06.900 --> 04:11:08.752
SAM: Have fun on this show.

5161
04:11:08.752 --> 04:11:10.779
We have fun.
MATT: Oh yeah.

5162
04:11:10.779 --> 04:11:12.220
We have--
ASHLEY: I am sweating,

5163
04:11:12.220 --> 04:11:14.300
and was just stress eating.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5164
04:11:14.300 --> 04:11:15.970
So much stress eating.

5165
04:11:15.970 --> 04:11:18.730
MARISHA: The back of my neck is drenched.

5166
04:11:18.730 --> 04:11:23.238
MATT: Ugh, oh man, this is, ugh.

5167
04:11:23.238 --> 04:11:25.200
There are NPCs

5168
04:11:25.200 --> 04:11:28.117
that are challenging and such, but, like,

5169
04:11:29.708 --> 04:11:33.020
between your dad and Taryon's dad,

5170
04:11:33.020 --> 04:11:36.840
those are two NPCs that have been the grossest

5171
04:11:36.840 --> 04:11:39.343
to step into for different reasons.

5172
04:11:39.343 --> 04:11:40.520
TALIESIN: Challenging subject.

5173
04:11:40.520 --> 04:11:41.353
MATT: Yeah.

5174
04:11:44.100 --> 04:11:44.933
Well.

5175
04:11:44.933 --> 04:11:47.110
LIAM: But those syphilis bandits, though.

5176
04:11:47.110 --> 04:11:49.920
(laughter)

5177
04:11:49.920 --> 04:11:51.795
MATT: You left an impression!

5178
04:11:53.433 --> 04:11:54.310
I'm just looking over here, I'm like--

5179
04:11:54.310 --> 04:11:56.200
TRAVIS: It was Benadryl.
MATT: I'm looking down here,

5180
04:11:56.200 --> 04:11:58.540
I'm like rolling to see, like, yeah, no,

5181
04:11:58.540 --> 04:12:00.213
they're going to run into them again.

5182
04:12:00.213 --> 04:12:01.590
A fun recurring theme.

5183
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:03.320
TALIESIN: I felt that there was something in that fire

5184
04:12:03.320 --> 04:12:05.570
that was worth, I'm so glad, that was great.

5185
04:12:05.570 --> 04:12:07.470
MARISHA: The fire?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

5186
04:12:07.470 --> 04:12:10.290
MATT: The bandit camp.
MARISHA: Oh.

5187
04:12:10.290 --> 04:12:12.330
MATT: That's a whole different thing.

5188
04:12:12.330 --> 04:12:13.670
TALIESIN: There's a coincidence down there.

5189
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:15.760
MATT: I know, anyway.

5190
04:12:15.760 --> 04:12:17.030
Thank you guys for joining us

5191
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:21.330
for this extensively emotionally tense episode.

5192
04:12:21.330 --> 04:12:23.830
We'll be back here next Thursday.

5193
04:12:23.830 --> 04:12:26.750
Looks like treading into the Cyrios Mountains

5194
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:28.253
that are surrounding Mount Mentiri.

5195
04:12:28.253 --> 04:12:30.000
LAURA: Oh, you guys remember when we first started,

5196
04:12:30.000 --> 04:12:31.350
when we were like, witch hut, witch hut--

5197
04:12:31.350 --> 04:12:34.660
MARISHA: Witch hut, witch hut.
LAURA: We're going to a witch hut!

5198
04:12:34.660 --> 04:12:36.150
TALIESIN: Oh man.
LIAM: And we surrounding

5199
04:12:36.150 --> 04:12:37.700
that hut, we're like, there's a witch in it.

5200
04:12:37.700 --> 04:12:39.720
Nope, yeah, there is.
MARISHA: It was a troll.

5201
04:12:39.720 --> 04:12:41.080
MATT: Yeah.

5202
04:12:41.080 --> 04:12:42.320
There's an actual witch hunt.

5203
04:12:42.320 --> 04:12:43.840
LAURA: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: And we know,

5204
04:12:43.840 --> 04:12:44.920
we're going to be prepared,

5205
04:12:44.920 --> 04:12:46.413
we're going to have our stuff together.

5206
04:12:46.413 --> 04:12:47.495
TRAVIS: Sure, we'll be prepared.

5207
04:12:47.495 --> 04:12:50.987
TALIESIN: We're going to make some good choices.

5208
04:12:53.050 --> 04:12:53.883
LIAM: Hey!

5209
04:12:53.883 --> 04:12:55.270
TALIESIN: I'm going to take Control Water.

5210
04:12:55.270 --> 04:12:56.820
Everything's going to fine.
MATT: Yeah.

5211
04:12:56.820 --> 04:12:58.270
That'd be great.

5212
04:12:58.270 --> 04:13:00.850
All right, guys, well, we hope to see you next Thursday.

5213
04:13:00.850 --> 04:13:04.370
In the meantime, be safe, take care of each other.

5214
04:13:04.370 --> 04:13:05.820
Know that we love you very much,

5215
04:13:05.820 --> 04:13:07.979
and is it Thursday yet?

5216
04:13:07.979 --> 04:13:09.266
Good night.

5217
04:13:09.266 --> 04:13:12.599

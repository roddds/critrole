00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.276
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
special Valentine's Day episode of Critical Role,

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.260
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit
around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons and invite you

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.213
to spend it with us. Thank you for joining us on
this Thursday. For those of you that are watching

00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:20.730
it with your loved one, thank you for spending it
with our loved ones. Those of you who are spending

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.314
it with us as your date, well, we'll see how the
night continues.

00:00:24.314 --> 00:00:26.514
(laughter)

00:00:26.514 --> 00:00:28.238
LAURA: We're about to romance the shit
out of you.

00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:29.227
MATT: Damn right.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.452
TRAVIS: Hopefully we're on TVs at Chili's and
Applebee's all across the country.

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:37.693
MATT: I mean, that's the goal in general, I think.
Anyway, before we get started for tonight's

00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:41.976
episode, we have some quick announcements to get
through. First and foremost, our fantastic

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:46.829
returning sponsor and friend of the show since the
beginning of this campaign, D&amp;D Beyond. Sam.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:55.130
SAM: Guys, it's Valentine's Day, and romance is in
the air. For me, there's no one I love more than

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:04.764
myself. But a close second is our good friends at
D&amp;D Beyond. They're the real target of Cupid's

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:13.478
arrow. I've written them a Valentine's Day poem
that I hope will set the mood for all of you young

00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:15.872
lovebirds out there. Guys, hit the music.

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:21.400
(seductive guitar music)

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.697
SAM: &lt;i&gt;Mi amor&lt;/i&gt;, your fiery interface makes a
player weep. It's why I advertise my love for you

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:36.714
every week. You know me deep down, your perception
isn't passive. When you're near, my heart is

00:01:36.714 --> 00:01:45.163
throbbing and massive. Your stats are maxed out.&lt;i&gt;
Chica&lt;/i&gt;, you have it all. Everything on you is a

00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:54.142
20, and it's always &lt;i&gt;naturel&lt;/i&gt;. Tonight let's roll a
six and nine near the stars above. I know one

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:57.476
skill you're proficient at: making love.

00:01:57.477 --> 00:02:00.479
TRAVIS: &lt;i&gt;Fuego! En fuego!&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.839
SAM: Your Burning Hands, your Shocking Grasp,
foreplay. I must hold my action or I might Color Spray.

00:02:07.842 --> 00:02:12.337
(laughter)

00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:17.791
SAM: But do not worry! I'll Expeditiously Retreat
to the bathroom, pop a little blue Goodberry,

00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:26.559
Regenerate for round two. No need to be stealthy;
you always get me screaming. Your Finger of Death

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.971
makes me cry out-- nope, can't say that while
we're streaming.

00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:33.074
(laughter)

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:38.532
SAM: I will click open your app, pour a glass of
Zinfandel, because there's no save that can block

00:02:38.532 --> 00:02:48.391
your spell. Tonight, you're RenÃ©e Zellweger and
I'm Colin Firth. You control my Tiny Servant. Did

00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:55.024
we just Move Earth? Ours is a passion that can
never be unzipped. It's as eternal as your sweet,

00:02:55.024 --> 00:03:01.312
sweet sponsorship! (music stops) You make my soul
feel lawful good, it's true, and tonight, I want

00:03:01.312 --> 00:03:07.610
to roll my dice all over you. We ran out
of music.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.330
(laughter)

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.406
(music restarts, cheering)

00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:20.839
SAM: One more stanza! On your iPad, please keep my
heart's stats and treasure. D&amp;D Beyond, I promise

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.283
I'll subscribe to you forever.

00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:27.392
TRAVIS: So pregnant right now.

00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:28.875
LAURA: Wow.

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:39.388
SAM: Also, they wanted me to say that they have a
new Discord server, where the community can gather

00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:47.859
to talk about all things Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Check
it out at dndbeyond.com/discord.

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:56.117
MATT: Discord. Thank you very much, Samuel. Wow,
there are a number of spells I will never be able

00:03:56.117 --> 00:03:58.087
to think of the right way again.

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:00.922
LIAM: I cast Col... (stammering)

00:04:00.922 --> 00:04:04.962
MARISHA: (stammering) ...or Spray.

00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:11.920
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.
As a heads up, our next episode of Between the Sheets,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.320
featuring our friend, artist, producer, and
guest on the last campaign of Critical Role,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.752
Noelle Stevenson. She's incredible as a person and
as a talent, and we're super excited to have her.

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:31.365
Her episode is next Monday at 7:00pm Pacific here
at twitch.tv/criticalrole, so look for that on Monday.

00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:34.669
MARISHA: Her interview is so good! So good.

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.365
LAURA: She's so wonderful.

00:04:36.935 --> 00:04:43.187
MATT: Harp music. Other harp music. Competing harp
music. Also, as a reminder, we will be heading out

00:04:43.187 --> 00:04:47.924
to Seattle next month for Emerald City Comic Con.
Super stoked for that. Tickets for autographs and

00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:53.356
photo ops are still available. You can go to our
website at critrole.com/events for all the details

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:55.030
on how to get that rolling.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.827
MARISHA: Also Sam's going to be on Pub Draw
next week.

00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:02.181
SAM: Apparently there's a show on our channel
called Pub Draw.

00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:06.655
TRAVIS: &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; are going to draw?

00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:12.989
SAM: I'm going to be taught how to draw, and
simultaneously, I'll watch the show for the first time.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.782
LAURA: I feel sorry for Babs, having to work
with that.

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:21.203
TRAVIS: Yeah, did we test her with someone like
Sam already? We don't want to warm her up with

00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:22.387
someone a little better?

00:05:22.387 --> 00:05:26.558
MARISHA: Well, she managed Laura and avoiding
drawing penises, so--

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:28.602
LAURA: I only drew two penises.

00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:29.953
MARISHA: It was pretty good!

00:05:29.953 --> 00:05:35.193
TRAVIS: Okay. I remember Sam's campaign one
contributions, and boy, they were something.

00:05:37.593 --> 00:05:42.719
MATT: Perfect. We're looking forward to that.
Laura, do you have some merch updates you

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.007
want to talk about?

00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:49.956
LAURA: Oh, well, our amazing art prints and stuff
that are in the store right now for pre-order?

00:05:49.956 --> 00:05:59.287
They're still there for pre-order. They're going
to be there until next week at 11:59pm on February

00:05:59.287 --> 00:06:01.847
21st, Pacific time.

00:06:01.848 --> 00:06:03.729
SAM: So ominous!

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.341
LAURA: You've got a whole other week to put that
order in. You can get to them on our shop.

00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:11.239
SAM: These are unsigned posters! These are signed
posters!

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:14.760
LAURA: Yes, yes. We have both versions available.
They're beautiful.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.390
SAM: They really are amazing.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:27.080
LAURA: shop.critrole.com or shop.critrole.co.uk,
if you are across the pond. There's also T-shirts

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.431
and stuff. They were restocked, so some other
stuff might be in the store right now. Yay!

00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:33.921
MATT: Brilliant. Thank you, Laura.

00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.493
LAURA: God, I am so bad at announcements.

00:06:36.493 --> 00:06:40.700
MATT: I disagree! It is adorable.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.119
LAURA: Thanks, guys.

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:52.177
MATT: No worries. Before we jump in, I've gotten a
little crafty in my free time recently. I've shown

00:06:52.177 --> 00:06:57.501
a few of you, but-- because keeping track of
potions is always a pain in the ass. I told you

00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:03.128
about this. I've seen some people have tweeted out
different variations they've done for physical

00:07:03.128 --> 00:07:10.943
healing potions. I went and got some red resin,
and I made some healing potions with red d4s in

00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:17.614
there. When we're doing the intro, I'll pass these
out to you guys. Here, I've got some greater

00:07:17.614 --> 00:07:19.982
healing potions and the regular healing potions.

00:07:19.992 --> 00:07:21.801
TRAVIS: Nobody has any greater, right?

00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:22.763
LAURA: Not yet?

00:07:22.763 --> 00:07:24.554
TALIESIN: I have a potion of healing.

00:07:24.555 --> 00:07:32.512
MATT: We'll figure it out, and I'll distribute
these. That's all we have to say for the moment.

00:07:32.512 --> 00:07:37.999
That being the case, let's jump in to tonight's
episode of Critical Role!

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:40.340
LIAM: (shouting) How do you play D&amp;D?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.426
[water bubbling]

00:07:42.526 --> 00:07:47.543
[thunder]

00:07:47.853 --> 00:07:49.667
[explosion]

00:07:49.977 --> 00:07:54.294
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:07:54.295 --> 00:08:01.978
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:08:01.978 --> 00:08:11.651
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:19.247
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:08:19.247 --> 00:08:23.307
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:08:27.525 --> 00:08:33.029
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:40.850
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.920
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:52.781
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:58.077
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:07.830
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:15.838
[fire burning]

00:09:16.688 --> 00:09:27.431
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, the Mighty
Nein had discovered that an important individual

00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:34.990
in the past history of Nott the Brave, the husband
from a previous life, it seems, had gotten wrapped

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:41.620
up in some of the chaos and the conflict between
the Empire and the Kryn Dynasty. There was an

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:49.501
attack on Felderwin in the Tillage, and it seems
that this individual was taken eastward, towards

00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:58.322
Xhorhas. You managed to find the collapsed tunnel
that they had used to surprise Felderwin, tunneled

00:09:58.322 --> 00:10:04.146
your way through that barrier, and then continued
to follow this pathway back eastward to pursue

00:10:04.146 --> 00:10:09.347
where they may have taken him. While you've gone
through, skirting the top of the Underdark of

00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:15.247
Wildemount, you managed to come in contact and
save yourself from a battle with a couple of

00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:22.361
ropers amongst the caverns below. You found
yourself suddenly in the center of a network of

00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:28.026
kobold tunnels, and in doing so, talked your way
out of a possible conflict. Made a new friend and

00:10:28.026 --> 00:10:35.585
ally named Spurt, who was a nice and excitable
inventor who wanted to show you the way through

00:10:35.586 --> 00:10:38.444
the tunnels, here towards the end of his life,
it seemed.

00:10:39.254 --> 00:10:40.615
LIAM: 11 days!

00:10:42.465 --> 00:10:49.828
MATT: Found that the tunnels seem to intersect
with an underground fire giant citadel beneath the

00:10:49.828 --> 00:10:56.108
Ashkeeper Peaks. Of which, Spurt ran out, attacked
one with bees, telling it, "You die!" and then got

00:10:56.109 --> 00:11:02.394
smashed immediately by a hammer. No longer having
to worry about Spurt's well-being, you then

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:10.152
focused on yours. Seeing that this open courtyard
on the outskirts of the citadel, an open chamber

00:11:10.742 --> 00:11:16.092
with a river of magma running through it and a
bridge where two giant fire giants were watching,

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:21.778
you all hatched a plan to get past without being
noticed, which almost worked out perfectly, except

00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:28.251
for one fateful, terrible stealth roll. In the
chaos, the bridge was destroyed. Nott was knocked

00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:34.098
out of invisibility, had fallen into the lava,
caught fire, and was dying, Beauregard reaching

00:11:34.099 --> 00:11:41.070
into the flames and pulling Nott's body from the
fire. You managed to rush out of the chamber, you

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:47.214
closing the door behind and sealing it with stone.
In this one moment, as you begin to rush down this

00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:51.966
small hallway, hearing the slamming of the hammer
behind you trying to break its way into the tunnel

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:56.721
where you've all escaped, you continue charging
into the darkness ahead.

00:11:56.991 --> 00:11:58.798
LIAM: Happy Valentine's Day, I guess?

00:11:58.798 --> 00:12:07.678
MATT: Happy Valentine's Day, guys! So Mighty Nein.
As you, Beauregard, are clutching the

00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:14.580
now-conscious, though very burned, Nott in your
arms, you guys are starting to hear the aggressive

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.711
slams of the fire giants dissipate behind you.
Eventually you hear the stone break, but based on

00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:25.275
the size of the chamber, there's little chance
they'd be able to come after you at the speed that

00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:29.913
you're traveling. About an hour of travel, you
take a moment to catch your breath.

00:12:29.913 --> 00:12:32.402
What would you like to do?

00:12:32.402 --> 00:12:34.364
LIAM: Let's tend to you.

00:12:34.364 --> 00:12:36.278
SAM: (groaning)

00:12:36.278 --> 00:12:40.725
LIAM: I start to pat your burns.

00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:42.681
SAM: Pat my burns?

00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:44.830
LIAM: What do we do? You two!
This doesn't do anything!

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:50.646
SAM: No, no, he's right. Whenever there's a severe
burn, you pat the wound. You smack it. You take

00:12:50.646 --> 00:12:54.872
your bare hand and place it on the wound.

00:12:54.872 --> 00:12:56.524
LIAM: I pour this--

00:12:56.524 --> 00:12:58.697
TALIESIN: I would save that potion.

00:12:58.697 --> 00:13:02.451
SAM: Your filthy hand, place it on my
exposed skin.

00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:05.199
LAURA: Why are you going to use that right away?
I know it's really cool looking, but

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:07.881
seriously, I have spells.

00:13:07.881 --> 00:13:09.223
SAM: What, you mean this thing?

00:13:09.224 --> 00:13:13.499
LAURA: Yeah, don't use that yet. Here,
I'm going to cast--

00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:15.471
LIAM: Well, nobody's doing anything, so--

00:13:15.471 --> 00:13:16.492
LAURA: I'm casting Cure Wounds!

00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:19.402
SAM: (sigh of relief)

00:13:19.403 --> 00:13:22.415
LAURA: I'll see if I have it at second level. I
do. I'm going to cast it at second level.

00:13:22.415 --> 00:13:23.733
TALIESIN: You're doing okay, though, right?

00:13:23.733 --> 00:13:24.494
SAM: I'm alive.

00:13:24.495 --> 00:13:25.635
TALIESIN: What are you at?

00:13:25.635 --> 00:13:29.778
LIAM: Point of order, DM. In the last game,
because I forget things, I thought I had three

00:13:29.778 --> 00:13:35.480
level four spells, but I only had two. I cast
three times. What I'd like to do is burn my

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.986
3rd-level slots entirely for whatever happens.

00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:39.120
MATT: Sure, there you go.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.120
TALIESIN: What time is it right now?
When is it time to sleep?

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.862
SAM: (whispering) Self-flagellation.

00:13:43.862 --> 00:13:45.748
TRAVIS: Whenever we want to. We're underground.

00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:47.642
LAURA: 13 points of healing.

00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:51.039
TALIESIN: What I'm saying is, are we starting
to get tired or not?

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:57.465
TRAVIS: I think we would all appreciate a rest of
any variety after those--

00:13:57.465 --> 00:14:02.414
LAURA: Oh, I shouldn't have used my healing, then,
if we're going to rest. That's stupid. I'm so dumb.

00:14:02.414 --> 00:14:05.210
SAM: Well, it helped me, so thank you.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.826
TRAVIS: We haven't put up a dome or nothing.

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:08.649
LIAM: I would have kept going.

00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:11.866
LAURA: We should keep going.

00:14:11.866 --> 00:14:18.237
TALIESIN: For a little while. Let's pull one more
healing, why don't we. Anybody else hurting?

00:14:18.237 --> 00:14:22.404
LAURA: How are you, Fjord? You got hit, too,
didn't you?

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.990
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think I got bit by a cow,
actually.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.182
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

00:14:26.182 --> 00:14:28.181
TRAVIS: Yep. I could use a little loving.

00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:30.524
SAM: Was it a bad bite?

00:14:30.524 --> 00:14:35.238
TRAVIS: The fucking teeth, man, yeah! They're
cows; they're shitty! All they do is chew all day.

00:14:35.238 --> 00:14:37.587
SAM: Don't they have flat teeth for grinding?

00:14:37.633 --> 00:14:40.744
TRAVIS: Yeah, but the pressure, right? That is a
big skull. If you think about it, per square inch,

00:14:40.744 --> 00:14:42.693
it's a motherfucker.

00:14:42.693 --> 00:14:47.333
TALIESIN: If we've got a second, I can cast Prayer
of Healing and do a little bit of--

00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:49.559
LAURA: Oh, I don't know if I have that one
prepared.

00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:52.284
TRAVIS: No, it's cool, yeah. Just heal Nott. It's
fine.

00:14:52.284 --> 00:14:57.278
TALIESIN: If we have ten minutes, if we're going
to take a quick breather, I'll cast Prayer of Healing.

00:14:57.278 --> 00:14:59.899
MATT: Okay, so roll for Prayer of Healing.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:05.174
TRAVIS: Just cow bit. No big deal.

00:15:05.174 --> 00:15:09.862
LAURA: It's just a little cow bite. I mean, we've
all been bitten by cows before, haven't we?

00:15:09.862 --> 00:15:16.502
TALIESIN: That's 16 hit points to whoever
wants it.

00:15:16.502 --> 00:15:18.303
MARISHA: 60?

00:15:18.303 --> 00:15:20.478
TALIESIN: 16 to anybody. 16.

00:15:20.478 --> 00:15:21.811
TRAVIS: I'll take it!

00:15:21.812 --> 00:15:25.046
LAURA: Almost there, almost.

00:15:25.046 --> 00:15:27.630
TRAVIS: Thank you, Ducey.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.446
LAURA: Good job, Caduceus.

00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:31.064
TALIESIN: Eh, no problem.

00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:35.456
TRAVIS: So we're pushing on? We're not going back
to explore the black citadel of mystery and darkness?

00:15:35.604 --> 00:15:38.402
LAURA: I don't know how we would get over there
with all the giants and stuff.

00:15:38.402 --> 00:15:40.848
TALIESIN: It seemed pretty far, but it was
interesting.

00:15:40.848 --> 00:15:48.461
MARISHA: Hey, Caleb, do you have any extra arm
wraps? Seems mine evaporated in the lava.

00:15:48.461 --> 00:15:51.748
LIAM: Not the bracers though, are good, yeah?

00:15:51.748 --> 00:15:58.515
MARISHA: No, bracers are good. They're a little
janky on my wrists now, though. Wraps were

00:15:58.515 --> 00:16:00.101
padding them out.

00:16:00.101 --> 00:16:02.041
LIAM: I have enough for three sets of arms.

00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:03.513
MARISHA: Are they clean?

00:16:03.513 --> 00:16:04.807
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;!

00:16:04.807 --> 00:16:06.195
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:08.131
LAURA: (whispering) You should smell them first.

00:16:08.131 --> 00:16:10.515
LIAM: How long have we known each other for?

00:16:10.515 --> 00:16:12.495
MARISHA: They smell all right?

00:16:12.495 --> 00:16:13.779
LAURA: A while.

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:15.121
LIAM: Do I still smell?

00:16:15.121 --> 00:16:18.370
LAURA: No, no, no, but you know, things that are
on your hands for a while, if they're real tight

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.165
and stuff, they can smell.

00:16:20.165 --> 00:16:21.685
TRAVIS: Yeah, they smell like vinegar
after a bit.

00:16:21.685 --> 00:16:22.599
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.699
LIAM: Those were in my bag.

00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:24.560
TRAVIS: Balsamic.

00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:25.807
LAURA: Oh, well that's good, then.

00:16:25.807 --> 00:16:27.117
MATT: Balls-samic?

00:16:27.117 --> 00:16:29.334
LAURA: I go and smell Caleb's hands.

00:16:29.517 --> 00:16:32.831
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw. No.

00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:40.023
LAURA: I got 19 with the last one I rolled, so
that's great.

00:16:40.023 --> 00:16:41.704
MATT: You're fine, you're fine.

00:16:41.704 --> 00:16:43.348
LIAM: These are on fire on a regular basis.

00:16:43.349 --> 00:16:46.639
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, they should be fucking
bacteria-free.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.282
MATT: A hint of mesquite.

00:16:48.282 --> 00:16:50.187
LAURA: Kind of like a campfire. I like it.

00:16:50.187 --> 00:16:52.243
LIAM: Oh, you.

00:16:52.243 --> 00:16:55.409
TRAVIS: Does the tunnel we're in now, now that
we're on the other side of this shitshow, appear

00:16:55.409 --> 00:16:58.709
the same as it did the previous portion?

00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:04.754
MATT: It does. At this moment, it's still really
warm. From the running, the activity, and the

00:17:04.755 --> 00:17:11.924
general heat of the surrounding rock, now knowing
the volcanic activity that runs parallel, or at

00:17:11.924 --> 00:17:17.249
least in the vicinity of these chambers, you're
all sweating pretty profusely and it's

00:17:17.249 --> 00:17:25.985
uncomfortable. The tunnel itself still continues
onward, the same ten-foot diameter, cylindrical

00:17:25.984 --> 00:17:32.217
tube. There are still occasional bits of broken
obsidian and other types of porous volcanic rock

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:38.519
that are broken and more torn through as part of
the burrowing of this worm entity. You can see,

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:43.345
still, some of the tracks of the various Kryn
soldiers following behind it, so you're on the

00:17:43.345 --> 00:17:44.730
right track still.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.875
TRAVIS: Good to push on until our wizard tells us
what time it is to sleep?

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:50.214
SAM: Sure.

00:17:50.214 --> 00:17:53.496
LAURA: What time is it? Did you already check--
think? What time is it?

00:17:53.497 --> 00:17:56.365
LIAM: I don't remember. Reality was two weeks
ago.

00:17:56.365 --> 00:18:03.206
MATT: I would say at this moment, mid-afternoon.

00:18:03.206 --> 00:18:05.781
LIAM: Hey, she asked, man.

00:18:05.781 --> 00:18:08.282
MATT: I know. Oh, I know. It's been two weeks for
me, too.

00:18:08.282 --> 00:18:10.624
SAM: Would you say it's 4:20-ish?

00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:11.790
MATT: Sure.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.943
SAM: Great.

00:18:12.943 --> 00:18:14.459
LAURA and SAM: Nice.

00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:20.721
MARISHA: Do the tracks on the ground, do they look
fresh, do they look like they've been there for a

00:18:20.721 --> 00:18:22.783
while, is it hard to say?

00:18:22.783 --> 00:18:24.433
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:30.182
MARISHA: Natural 19, for a 24.

00:18:30.182 --> 00:18:31.698
MATT: Nice.

00:18:31.698 --> 00:18:34.763
LAURA: That was the nerdiest I've ever heard you
sound while saying a number.

00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:36.706
MARISHA: (nasally) Um, a natural 19.

00:18:36.707 --> 00:18:44.769
MATT: They seem to be a little over a week or so.
There isn't a lot of weather that transpires,

00:18:44.769 --> 00:18:53.212
there isn't a lot of wind or things that can brush
aside or eventually cast away these tracks, so

00:18:53.212 --> 00:19:01.283
it's hard to really tell the specifics, but based
on the travel, the speed they seem to be going,

00:19:01.284 --> 00:19:04.871
and how long ago this transpired, you gather
they're probably a little over a week old.

00:19:04.871 --> 00:19:10.769
TRAVIS: Nice. No flash floods down here.
We push on!

00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:12.430
SAM: Ah!

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.308
TRAVIS: Did I startle you?

00:19:14.308 --> 00:19:15.911
SAM: Yes.

00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:22.206
MATT: All right. Continuing on for the next few
hours, who's holding front watch? Are we keeping

00:19:22.206 --> 00:19:23.790
with the same order as last time?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.522
LAURA: I'll watch!

00:19:25.522 --> 00:19:27.371
SAM: I will, too!

00:19:27.372 --> 00:19:31.721
LAURA: Yeah, me and you, Nott. Our keen eyes will
see everything.

00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:34.738
TALIESIN: I'll keep towards the back, keep an eye
on what's behind us.

00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:36.798
MATT: Okay. I'd like you both to make perception
checks, please.

00:19:36.798 --> 00:19:40.457
SAM: 16.

00:19:40.457 --> 00:19:43.429
LAURA: 21!

00:19:43.429 --> 00:19:53.020
MATT: Very nice. Traversing for the next few
hours, the tunnel begins to slowly come to an

00:19:53.020 --> 00:20:01.026
incline. For as much as it's been steadily
delving, it's slowly beginning to curve in an

00:20:01.026 --> 00:20:07.979
upward fashion.The temperature begins to subside a
bit. The warmth begins to become a little more

00:20:07.979 --> 00:20:17.802
comfortable by comparison. A few more hours of
travel and eventually you find yourselves getting

00:20:17.802 --> 00:20:22.370
a bit tired, the exhaustion of the day's
activities and the perpetual travel through this

00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:25.535
tunnel slowly beginning to catch up to you. You
can continue to press on if you like, or you could

00:20:25.535 --> 00:20:27.454
attempt to bed down for the night.

00:20:27.454 --> 00:20:29.590
MARISHA: I think we should bed down.

00:20:29.642 --> 00:20:30.980
LIAM: Okay.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:36.590
TALIESIN: And another healing spell before we go
to sleep, just to top everybody as close off as possible.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.000
LAURA: I can send another message to Yeza if you
want me to.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.835
SAM: Didn't you do that once today already?

00:20:41.835 --> 00:20:43.671
LAURA: I can do it again.

00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:48.634
SAM: Okay. But last time, didn't he say that he
was in a place where he couldn't talk?

00:20:48.634 --> 00:20:52.854
LAURA: Yeah, well, maybe he's moved. You know,
we've been traveling for eight or ten hours or

00:20:52.917 --> 00:20:56.283
something, Caleb would know, but something long.

00:20:56.283 --> 00:21:01.127
LIAM: Also, you could ask yes or no questions and
have him cough or sneeze.

00:21:01.127 --> 00:21:02.599
SAM: Cough once for yes.

00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:10.120
LAURA: Yeah, but that's a real-- okay. What should
I ask? I'll say cough once for yes, cough twice

00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:12.859
for no, that's already so many words, though!

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:16.869
TRAVIS: Are you moving, I guess, would be--
are you still in the same place?

00:21:16.869 --> 00:21:19.126
SAM: Any landmarks, maybe?

00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:21.384
TRAVIS: No, that's not a coughing question.

00:21:21.384 --> 00:21:30.529
SAM: Yes, there are landmarks. Shit! Describe them
in coughs!

00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:35.487
TRAVIS: Are they moving you? Cough once for yes,
twice for no.

00:21:35.487 --> 00:21:44.721
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. I'm going to try that.
This is weird.

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:46.443
MATT: Okay.

00:21:46.443 --> 00:21:48.277
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.

00:21:48.277 --> 00:21:50.437
SAM: Or just speak, if you can speak.

00:21:50.437 --> 00:21:53.700
LAURA: Yeah, well, I figure he'll do that
if he can.

00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:56.575
TALIESIN: 25 hit points to anybody who wants it.

00:21:56.575 --> 00:21:58.630
TRAVIS: All the way up, that's beautiful, okay.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.873
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Sending.

00:22:00.873 --> 00:22:02.939
MATT: All right, you're sending it to--

00:22:02.939 --> 00:22:04.263
LAURA: Yeza.

00:22:04.263 --> 00:22:05.698
MATT: Yeza. Okay.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:14.728
LAURA: (clears throat) Hi! Cough once for yes,
twice for no. Are they moving you?

00:22:17.968 --> 00:22:20.410
...Are you safe?

00:22:20.462 --> 00:22:27.322
SAM: Two questions? Oh, no! No! No!

00:22:27.322 --> 00:22:34.597
MARISHA: If he coughs twice is that two yeses?
What if he coughs three times? Is the first one a

00:22:34.597 --> 00:22:36.386
yes or the last one a yes?

00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:43.126
TRAVIS: (laughing) I love the panic so you fixed it
with a second question! You should've just sent it!

00:22:43.171 --> 00:22:45.321
TALIESIN: You have to use the whole message.

00:22:45.356 --> 00:22:47.419
LAURA: Yeah, you have to use all the words!

00:22:47.515 --> 00:22:49.611
TALIESIN: Otherwise it's a waste.

00:22:49.611 --> 00:23:00.843
MATT: There's a long pause. You can almost hear
Yeza going, "Uh?"

00:23:00.849 --> 00:23:02.812
TRAVIS: Oh god.

00:23:02.813 --> 00:23:05.696
MATT: (coughs twice)

00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:09.886
SAM: Was it one yes or two yes?

00:23:09.886 --> 00:23:11.909
TRAVIS: Jesus, it's only your husband!

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.588
LAURA: Wait!

00:23:12.588 --> 00:23:15.428
MATT: (coughs once)

00:23:15.429 --> 00:23:17.337
SAM: One, two, three. Is two, is two yes?

00:23:17.337 --> 00:23:21.364
LAURA: They're not moving him, and what was the
second question?

00:23:21.364 --> 00:23:23.208
SAM: Are you safe?

00:23:23.208 --> 00:23:27.334
LAURA: And he said yes! They're not moving him and
he's safe!

00:23:27.334 --> 00:23:30.273
SAM: That's good. This is the best it could've
possibly gone.

00:23:30.273 --> 00:23:32.005
LAURA: Totally!

00:23:32.006 --> 00:23:34.746
TALIESIN: Was that once for yes? Twice for no?

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:38.921
LAURA: Yeah, once for yes, twice for no. Two times,
he said he's not moving. One time, he said he's safe.

00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:41.149
TALIESIN: Was it are they moving you
or did you move?

00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:42.822
LAURA: I said, "Are they moving you?"

00:23:42.822 --> 00:23:44.554
TALIESIN: Okay, I don't remember.

00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:49.289
LAURA: Okay, I can do it one more time. I can send
him another message. What should I ask him?

00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:54.651
SAM: I don't know, because he doesn't know
where he is.

00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:56.525
LAURA: Right.

00:23:56.525 --> 00:24:04.895
MARISHA: Maybe if he's surrounded by a bunch of
people. Like, are we walking into an ambush?

00:24:04.895 --> 00:24:06.624
LIAM: Are they always watching you?

00:24:06.624 --> 00:24:08.636
LAURA: Always watching you, that's really good!
Okay, okay, okay.

00:24:08.636 --> 00:24:13.742
TALIESIN: Or cough for how many people are
watching you, maybe?

00:24:13.742 --> 00:24:16.960
LAURA: That's really smart. Okay, I'm going to
send it again.

00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:19.091
TRAVIS: Amazing, okay.

00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:21.195
TALIESIN: Aww, wow.

00:24:21.195 --> 00:24:23.101
LAURA: So good.

00:24:23.101 --> 00:24:26.539
TRAVIS: Jester, remember, you can cut it short,
you don't have to fill all 25 words.

00:24:26.539 --> 00:24:31.444
LAURA: I think you have to say it all or else the
spell doesn't work.

00:24:31.444 --> 00:24:32.907
SAM: She is a magic user.

00:24:32.907 --> 00:24:34.357
LAURA: I know these things.

00:24:34.357 --> 00:24:35.985
TRAVIS: She's not the only one, but it's okay.

00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:39.211
LAURA: Do you cast Sending? Did you want to send a
message to Yeza?

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:40.890
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll do it.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:42.889
LAURA: (gasps) Can you do it?

00:24:42.889 --> 00:24:44.331
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want me to do it?

00:24:44.332 --> 00:24:47.685
LAURA: Yeah.

00:24:47.685 --> 00:24:55.120
TRAVIS: All right. Yeza, cough for the number
of people that are around you.

00:24:55.121 --> 00:25:01.229
You can reply to this message. Nobody's there.

00:25:01.229 --> 00:25:03.031
LAURA: You're a dick.

00:25:03.031 --> 00:25:03.943
TRAVIS: What?

00:25:03.943 --> 00:25:05.102
LAURA: I don't believe him.

00:25:05.102 --> 00:25:06.416
TRAVIS: Really?

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.139
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.358
SAM: Ask if Fjord was bullshitting or not.

00:25:10.358 --> 00:25:12.888
LAURA: Okay. Okay, I'm going to say--

00:25:12.888 --> 00:25:14.958
LIAM: Don't burn your words for that!

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:23.556
LAURA: Don't say that? Okay. Hi again! Hey, can
you cough for how many people are watching you?

00:25:27.696 --> 00:25:28.742
That's all.

00:25:28.915 --> 00:25:32.166
SAM: This is Jester, signing off!

00:25:32.166 --> 00:25:38.310
MARISHA: You know, Fjord's got a good point,
anyone who has Sending--

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.851
MATT: (coughs three times)

00:25:41.852 --> 00:25:47.384
LAURA: Three people, three people are watching
him! We can kill three people, that's fine.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.411
SAM: Sure, sure. Yes.

00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:50.831
LAURA: What?

00:25:50.831 --> 00:25:53.708
LIAM: Depends on who the three people are,
but yeah.

00:25:53.709 --> 00:25:55.225
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

00:25:55.225 --> 00:25:58.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, if it's three more fire giants,
fuck, we in trouble.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.452
MARISHA: Or three wizards.

00:26:00.452 --> 00:26:06.811
SAM: Let's think optimistically, since it's the
love of my life, and think that it's someone that

00:26:06.811 --> 00:26:08.241
we can defeat.

00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:13.297
LAURA: It's probably three lazy guards watching
prisoners that they think are not going

00:26:13.297 --> 00:26:15.023
to be able to escape.

00:26:15.023 --> 00:26:22.013
TRAVIS: Underfed, underpaid, lazy, irresponsible,
right? I mean, they get the shit duty.

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:25.909
Don't trust them with protecting anyone.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.396
SAM: Well, my husband's actually pretty important,
so I wouldn't--

00:26:28.396 --> 00:26:32.318
TRAVIS: Didn't you say he's not a fighter, though?
So probably not a very violent--

00:26:32.318 --> 00:26:37.902
SAM: I think they'd put someone on him who's
pretty capable. I mean, he's a very smart man and,

00:26:37.902 --> 00:26:46.181
even though he's not a fighter-- let's say they're
mid-level, all right? Mid to high. Takeable!

00:26:46.181 --> 00:26:49.944
But not so low that it's an insult.

00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:52.153
LIAM: If you're going to talk for a while, I'm
going to put up the dome.

00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:53.427
SAM: Okay.

00:26:53.427 --> 00:26:58.665
TALIESIN: Are we bribing these people? They're on
the take? Takeable?

00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:02.110
LAURA: Yeah. Or killing them. We're probably
going to kill them.

00:27:02.111 --> 00:27:04.064
TRAVIS: All options are on the table.

00:27:04.064 --> 00:27:05.976
LAURA: Kill them!

00:27:05.976 --> 00:27:09.863
MATT: So you guys are setting up a campsite here,
utilizing your dome as well?

00:27:09.863 --> 00:27:14.159
LIAM: What does the surrounding passage look like
where we are? Is it rough-hewn?

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:20.628
MATT: It's the same burrowed pathway you've been
following most of this journey. At this point,

00:27:20.628 --> 00:27:25.118
you've been following almost exclusively the
burrowed trail of this worm creature as it's tore

00:27:25.118 --> 00:27:31.263
through this obsidian, subterranean portion of the
Ashkeeper Peaks. Where you are right now, the

00:27:31.263 --> 00:27:38.880
amounts of volcanic rock seem to have dwindled as
the tunnel begins to curve itself in an upward incline.

00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:43.558
LIAM: Do we want to do the same little trick,
you and I?

00:27:43.558 --> 00:27:52.070
TALIESIN: Yeah, we can. Let me take a look at
that, I have that somewhere. Yeah, I can do that.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:57.311
LIAM: You dig a little bit to the side and I will
throw up the dome.

00:27:57.311 --> 00:28:00.983
TALIESIN: I make a little bit of room,
use it to cover us.

00:28:00.983 --> 00:28:08.245
MATT: Okay. You guys all curl up for the evening's
rest exhausted, sweaty, and looking forward to a

00:28:08.246 --> 00:28:12.841
number of hours where you don't have your mind
bent on whatever dark space you've thrust yourself

00:28:12.841 --> 00:28:15.946
into this past week. Yes?

00:28:15.946 --> 00:28:19.438
LIAM: I also spend an hour bringing my cat back.

00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:27.570
MATT: Okay. You bring Frumpkin back. Does anyone
want to keep watch, or are you all feeling

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.725
pretty comfy to sleep within the dome?

00:28:30.725 --> 00:28:33.015
TRAVIS: I will take first watch.

00:28:33.016 --> 00:28:38.138
MATT: All righty. While the rest of you are resting,
Fjord, make a perception check for me, please.

00:28:42.318 --> 00:28:43.235
TRAVIS: 12.

00:28:43.236 --> 00:28:53.526
MATT: Okay. As the evening progresses, whether it
be the proximity to the subterranean region of

00:28:53.526 --> 00:29:01.802
this mountain or the fact that you are rising up
from the portions of the tunnel that seem to skirt

00:29:01.802 --> 00:29:07.346
the Underdark, nothing seems to find its way to
you that's a bother. Uneventful evening for the

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:11.920
watch that you take. Anybody take a second watch?

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.133
LAURA: I'll take second watch.

00:29:14.133 --> 00:29:15.798
LIAM: I will stay up as well.

00:29:15.798 --> 00:29:19.874
MATT: The two of you, make perception checks
while Fjord finishes out the evening's rest.

00:29:23.994 --> 00:29:24.958
LAURA: 22.

00:29:25.949 --> 00:29:26.825
LIAM: Ten.

00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:40.701
MATT: Very nice. As the evening progresses, you're
confident in the lull of activity this tunnel

00:29:40.701 --> 00:29:50.531
seems to bring. You do catch some sort of a shift
of movement, or a shift in texture along the roof

00:29:50.531 --> 00:29:57.012
of this tunnel, and as you look up, you see
there's some sort of a creature, larger than most

00:29:57.012 --> 00:30:06.914
of you, that takes up the upper half of this
tunnel. A heavy, dark shell, almost turtle-like.

00:30:08.164 --> 00:30:14.678
You see these extended arms that end in these
hooks. As it crawls its way across the ceiling,

00:30:14.678 --> 00:30:18.354
its shell almost scrapes the top of the dome.

00:30:18.354 --> 00:30:22.591
LAURA: Oh my gosh! I'm drawing in the sketchbook.

00:30:22.591 --> 00:30:30.419
MATT: It doesn't seem to pay any mind to the dome.
Continues scrambling past and further down the tunnel.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.272
LIAM: You saw something that looked like that?

00:30:32.272 --> 00:30:34.523
LAURA: Yeah, it crossed right overhead of us.

00:30:34.523 --> 00:30:35.675
LIAM: I don't like that.

00:30:35.675 --> 00:30:38.107
LAURA: Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:39.018
LIAM: No.

00:30:39.728 --> 00:30:41.677
LAURA: I draw googly eyes on it.

00:30:41.787 --> 00:30:43.885
LIAM: That makes it a little more palatable.

00:30:43.885 --> 00:30:46.128
LAURA: Yeah, it's not as scary anymore, huh?

00:30:46.128 --> 00:30:47.626
MARISHA: It's kind of cute now.

00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:48.723
LAURA: Are you awake?

00:30:48.723 --> 00:30:51.107
MARISHA: Oh, wait, no. I thought this was morning.

00:30:51.107 --> 00:30:52.684
TRAVIS: Level of exhaustion!

00:30:53.354 --> 00:30:55.227
MATT: Beau's talking in her sleep.

00:30:55.417 --> 00:31:00.442
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like the
nice sound of rainfall, so that Beau will be able

00:31:00.442 --> 00:31:01.683
to go back to sleep.

00:31:01.683 --> 00:31:03.470
TRAVIS: Oh, lovely!

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:09.873
MATT: Now that's a good use of a cantrip. Other
than that, the evening's uneventful, but you did

00:31:09.873 --> 00:31:15.367
watch this hook-armed-like, beaked creature crawl
its way past you and make its way deeper in

00:31:15.367 --> 00:31:17.245
towards the mountain base.

00:31:18.445 --> 00:31:26.230
LAURA: (whispering) Caleb! I don't really think
that you're stinky. Just so you know. I mean, I

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.716
did, but I don't anymore. You don't smell bad. You
should know.

00:31:32.676 --> 00:31:35.539
LIAM: You can keep the running gag going,
if you like.

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:41.210
LAURA: Only if it doesn't make you uncomfortable.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:45.440
LIAM: No. It made me uncomfortable at first, but
now I know you pretty well, so it's fine.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.886
LAURA: Okay, good.

00:31:47.356 --> 00:31:52.042
LIAM: Plus it was hot back there, so now
these do-- I was sweating.

00:31:52.042 --> 00:31:53.935
LAURA: Yeah, I can smell your armpits.

00:31:53.935 --> 00:31:57.692
LIAM: There's nothing to hide now, so I will put
those away.

00:32:03.982 --> 00:32:11.472
MATT: The rest of your watch goes without issue.
The rest of you come to consciousness, long rest

00:32:11.472 --> 00:32:17.851
completed. You can mark that for your characters,
healed and recovered. Continuing your journey--

00:32:17.851 --> 00:32:22.001
LIAM: I'm sorry. Because I didn't think we'd go
right to sleep, so instead of taking out

00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:26.865
3rd-levels, I'm going to cross off one 4th-level
for the next chunk of time.

00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:27.670
MATT: Okay.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.610
TRAVIS: Why are you doing this?

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.836
LIAM: I used too many powerful spells last game.

00:32:33.836 --> 00:32:35.673
LAURA: Liam likes to punish himself.

00:32:35.673 --> 00:32:37.516
MATT: We all know this about him.

00:32:37.516 --> 00:32:39.330
TRAVIS: How did you know you did that?

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.216
LIAM: There's this thing called the internet.

00:32:41.366 --> 00:32:43.268
TRAVIS: Oh, got it.

00:32:43.268 --> 00:32:46.095
SAM: They point out things that you do wrong,
sometimes.

00:32:47.315 --> 00:32:48.716
MATT: Every now and then.

00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:51.246
TRAVIS: Ignore that thing. It's way more fun.

00:32:51.897 --> 00:32:55.089
LAURA: Does anybody want one of these chocolates?
They're very good.

00:32:55.089 --> 00:32:57.086
MARISHA: Yes, I do. Happy Valentine's Day!

00:33:01.116 --> 00:33:02.128
MATT: Good catch.

00:33:02.128 --> 00:33:05.129
TALIESIN: I bet that looked really good on the
split screen.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:06.958
SAM: You caught that manly.

00:33:06.959 --> 00:33:08.769
TRAVIS: She threw it right to my hand.

00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.931
SAM: I know, but it looked so studly the way you
caught it.

00:33:12.711 --> 00:33:14.379
MATT: You okay, Sam? Need a moment?

00:33:14.379 --> 00:33:16.610
SAM: I have a little bit of a boner.

00:33:18.061 --> 00:33:20.909
MATT and LAURA: Happy Valentine's Day.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:27.837
MATT: Coming to consciousness, gathering
yourselves, the journey continues.

00:33:27.837 --> 00:33:29.614
LIAM: (whispering) Where's the candy?

00:33:30.324 --> 00:33:32.133
MATT: I don't know where the candy is.

00:33:32.133 --> 00:33:34.037
MARISHA: There's one hidden behind--

00:33:34.037 --> 00:33:35.588
MATT: We've lost a Laura.

00:33:35.908 --> 00:33:37.599
SAM: Keep going, Matt! Keep going!

00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:39.627
MARISHA: Ooh, there's a whole pack!

00:33:39.627 --> 00:33:40.772
MATT: That's dangerous.

00:33:40.772 --> 00:33:41.772
LAURA: You want some?

00:33:41.772 --> 00:33:42.678
MATT: No, I'm good.

00:33:42.679 --> 00:33:45.370
LIAM: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, folks. Snacks!

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.331
MATT: Pushing onward--

00:33:47.332 --> 00:33:49.049
LIAM: Just as slick as your husband.

00:33:49.049 --> 00:33:54.533
MATT: A few more hours pass as the tunnel begins
to curve to more and more of a steep incline,

00:33:54.534 --> 00:34:03.104
until you begin to notice the stonework becomes
looser. The solid earth that most of this tunnel

00:34:03.104 --> 00:34:08.759
previously was begins to be broken up with looser
rock and elements of the tunnel that were not as

00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:14.108
stable as they previously were. Eventually you get
to a point where you're no longer hiking and

00:34:14.108 --> 00:34:19.990
walking. You're having to hand-over-foot climb up.
It's almost becoming a vertical tunnel.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.335
LIAM: Ooh, that's not good.

00:34:21.335 --> 00:34:22.424
MARISHA: It sucks.

00:34:23.583 --> 00:34:27.707
MATT: To continue, I would like the entire party,
Yasha included, to make an athletics check, please.

00:34:28.368 --> 00:34:38.120
LAURA: Can Nugget blink and go blink, blink,
blink, as he climbs? He's probably pretty agile.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.639
MATT: He's agile, but at a certain point, he's
going to have to hold onto somebody because it's

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:47.183
going to become vertical. Dogs don't really have a
good climbing grip.

00:34:47.813 --> 00:34:50.428
LAURA: I wonder, if Yasha can climb super well,
if--

00:34:51.257 --> 00:34:55.833
TALIESIN: Let's also maybe tie rope, if we're
going to be doing--

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:58.094
LAURA: From one to the other?

00:34:58.094 --> 00:34:59.176
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:34:59.176 --> 00:35:02.560
LAURA: So if one person falls, everybody falls! I
like it!

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.029
TALIESIN: Thank you. Wait--

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.015
LAURA: We're a team!

00:35:05.015 --> 00:35:06.491
TALIESIN: Is that what happens?

00:35:06.491 --> 00:35:07.831
SAM: I don't like that idea.

00:35:07.831 --> 00:35:10.543
TRAVIS: You need to have an anchor point
for that to work.

00:35:10.543 --> 00:35:11.640
SAM: Yasha!

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.969
TRAVIS: You don't want her to be the anchor
point.

00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:22.275
LAURA: I'm going to hook Nugget-- I'm going to
take my cloak off. I'm going to tuck Sprinkle into

00:35:22.275 --> 00:35:28.116
my shirt, and then I'm going to bring my cloak
around Nugget and hook it around my shoulders

00:35:28.116 --> 00:35:30.052
so that he's like a messenger bag on me.

00:35:30.052 --> 00:35:31.882
MATT: Okay. A blink dog messenger bag.

00:35:31.882 --> 00:35:33.791
LAURA: Yeah. Then I'm going to climb up.

00:35:33.791 --> 00:35:35.303
LIAM: That dog is confused.

00:35:35.813 --> 00:35:36.842
LAURA: He likes it!

00:35:38.792 --> 00:35:43.748
MATT: He seems confused, and he likes it. Going
across, we have--

00:35:44.378 --> 00:35:48.719
TRAVIS: Yasha got a 14. Fjord got an eight.

00:35:49.379 --> 00:35:50.220
MARISHA: Ten.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.940
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Sechs&lt;/i&gt;. For Valentine's.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.122
SAM: 16.

00:35:54.123 --> 00:35:56.770
LAURA: Oh no. An eight.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.441
TALIESIN: An 18.

00:35:59.361 --> 00:36:07.410
MATT: Okay. It doesn't go completely vertical, but
it goes at a very steep incline. This is end of

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:13.412
The Descent-type incline. Rocks are pulling out
with your grasp. You have to catch yourself, and

00:36:13.412 --> 00:36:20.464
they tumble down. You hear them clatter down
behind you, into the dark. You begin to look up.

00:36:20.465 --> 00:36:26.691
You can see light, a little point of light in the
direction you're beginning to climb, suddenly

00:36:26.691 --> 00:36:29.986
begin to come into view from underneath the
curving roof.

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:33.844
TRAVIS: Please don't be a privy. It's a pooper.

00:36:33.844 --> 00:36:35.065
MARISHA: Little peephole.

00:36:35.065 --> 00:36:40.006
MATT: You're not quite sure the distance of it. You're
not sure the size of it. You see a point of light.

00:36:40.006 --> 00:36:43.859
LAURA: Are we going to come out and we're going to
be amongst all of the bad guys?

00:36:43.859 --> 00:36:46.750
SAM: Maybe, or maybe it's a forest. You don't
know.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:49.328
LAURA: Oh my gosh! (grunting)

00:36:49.528 --> 00:36:51.104
MATT: Are you leading the charge?

00:36:51.104 --> 00:36:53.540
LAURA: No, I'm making efforts because it's hard.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.096
TALIESIN: I'll take the front with somebody.

00:36:58.096 --> 00:37:00.340
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha and Caduceus will do it.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.190
MATT: Cool. Who's after them?

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.106
LIAM: I will go right behind them.

00:37:04.106 --> 00:37:12.465
MATT: Okay, so everyone behind Caleb... (laughs)
Caleb, making your way up, the wraps--

00:37:12.465 --> 00:37:14.076
have you rewrapped yourself?

00:37:14.076 --> 00:37:15.695
LIAM: No. Nothing to hide anymore.

00:37:15.695 --> 00:37:20.262
MATT: Which is unfortunate, because the texture
does add to a bit of the grip that you're used to

00:37:20.262 --> 00:37:25.254
having in some circumstances. Combined with the
general sweat and the exertion, being not the most

00:37:25.254 --> 00:37:31.374
athletic member of the group, you reach forward
and grab a stone that dislodges. You drop it and

00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:36.082
reach out for another one. That one dislodges too.
You reach out and grab the side, and your fingers

00:37:36.082 --> 00:37:42.009
hit loose gravel, and you scrape back. The rest of
you behind look up and watch Caleb go, "Whoa!"

00:37:42.009 --> 00:37:43.561
and begin to fall in your direction.

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:45.097
LAURA: Can I try to catch him?

00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:49.263
MATT: Unfortunately, you're a little bit too far
away. You and Caduceus are up ahead of him--

00:37:49.263 --> 00:37:53.183
LAURA: Oh, no, I was not ahead. I was behind
Caleb. It was Yasha and Caduceus.

00:37:53.183 --> 00:37:59.783
MATT: Oh, that's right, Yasha. Sorry. Then you
know what? Yes, I'll let you try that.

00:37:59.783 --> 00:38:02.261
Make a strength check to try to grab and hold on.

00:38:02.261 --> 00:38:06.119
LIAM: Can I ask-- Oh, to catch me from not even
falling at all?

00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:08.482
LAURA: To catch you from &lt;i&gt;falling&lt;/i&gt; falling.

00:38:10.802 --> 00:38:13.834
SAM and LAURA: It's a cocked 20.

00:38:14.564 --> 00:38:15.567
LIAM: It's cocked!

00:38:15.567 --> 00:38:16.532
MATT: Roll again.

00:38:20.742 --> 00:38:21.486
LAURA: 12.

00:38:23.456 --> 00:38:30.484
MATT: You manage to catch Caleb by the scruff of
the coat and pull back. Your hand begins to come

00:38:30.484 --> 00:38:37.450
loose, and you reach out and grab onto another
piece of stone. You feel your fingernails grind

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:43.131
and snap, but you barely manage to hold on.
Somebody's going to have to support, or they're

00:38:43.131 --> 00:38:45.946
both going to go down here. Below them,
who's going to help?

00:38:45.947 --> 00:38:48.001
TRAVIS: I'll reach out and try to help.

00:38:48.001 --> 00:38:50.772
MARISHA: I'll make an arm brace with Fjord
on the other side.

00:38:50.772 --> 00:38:52.017
TRAVIS: Yeah, clothesline.

00:38:52.017 --> 00:38:53.923
LIAM: This is stupid!

00:38:54.283 --> 00:39:01.598
MATT: You take a moment to right yourselves and
get back into a steady position, eventually

00:39:01.598 --> 00:39:03.273
getting Caleb back on the trail.

00:39:03.273 --> 00:39:05.005
LAURA: I put him right next to me.

00:39:05.005 --> 00:39:09.805
MATT: You continue, but the DC is jumping with
each pass now, especially as the exhaustion kicks

00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:13.714
in. Continuing the path, I'd like everyone to make
another athletics check, please.

00:39:13.715 --> 00:39:18.590
LIAM: (singing) Kryptonite! Nope.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:26.167
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a 20. Fjord rolled a 17.

00:39:26.747 --> 00:39:27.658
MARISHA: 19.

00:39:27.958 --> 00:39:28.716
LIAM: Ten.

00:39:29.466 --> 00:39:30.247
SAM: 13.

00:39:30.797 --> 00:39:31.529
LAURA: Eight.

00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.924
TALIESIN: 13.

00:39:37.165 --> 00:39:38.353
SAM: Everyone?

00:39:38.353 --> 00:39:41.785
MATT: No, no. The DC went up to a 12.

00:39:42.865 --> 00:39:44.296
LAURA: Oh, so just me and you.

00:39:44.976 --> 00:39:50.329
MATT: Two failures. That's still most successes.
You continue up, and the light gets brighter and

00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:58.874
closer. It's hard to make out a color because it
looks like white, but it's not super bright. It

00:39:58.874 --> 00:40:08.265
would be a dull daylight. You get the sense that
this may indeed be an approaching exit. I would

00:40:08.266 --> 00:40:11.667
like one third and final group athletics check.

00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:17.685
TRAVIS: I have a question. On the wall, if we were
to look down, about how far down would we fall, if

00:40:17.685 --> 00:40:20.496
we were to fall at this point?
If we had to guess?

00:40:20.496 --> 00:40:22.305
MATT: How far does your darkvision go?

00:40:22.305 --> 00:40:23.455
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:30.666
MATT: It goes past your 60 feet. Tumbling down,
it's not a complete fall. It would be a

00:40:30.666 --> 00:40:32.819
Homer Simpson down the side of the cliff.

00:40:32.819 --> 00:40:33.989
LAURA: "As you wish."

00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:36.092
MATT: Yeah, basically.

00:40:36.642 --> 00:40:38.808
TRAVIS: With stone and obsidian.

00:40:39.169 --> 00:40:42.170
MATT: It would be a few hundred feet.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.777
LAURA and MARISHA: Ooh!

00:40:43.777 --> 00:40:47.779
TRAVIS: Good good. Good! Let's roll this shit.

00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:50.429
MATT: Let's roll your final group athletics
check.

00:40:51.259 --> 00:40:55.457
LIAM: (laughing) Dancing on 19, and it went to
three.

00:40:55.457 --> 00:40:56.633
LAURA: Oh no!

00:40:57.303 --> 00:40:58.565
MATT: All right, so?

00:40:59.555 --> 00:41:04.057
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a 25. Fjord rolled a five.

00:41:05.467 --> 00:41:06.472
MARISHA: 22.

00:41:06.862 --> 00:41:07.708
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Vier&lt;/i&gt;.

00:41:09.308 --> 00:41:11.691
SAM and LAURA: 20.

00:41:12.151 --> 00:41:13.109
TALIESIN: Ten.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:22.335
MATT: You guys &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; pulled off more successes
than failures on that. Okay! There are some shaky

00:41:22.335 --> 00:41:27.602
moments where a few of the party begin to bow back
from the wall, and you hear the beginnings of the

00:41:27.602 --> 00:41:32.957
(fearful noises) from different people. The rest
of you who are sure in this climb reach out to

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:39.892
support and push them. It's a slow climb. It takes
a while. Once again, the temperature is colder

00:41:39.892 --> 00:41:47.591
now, more so than the general underground feel.
There is a bit of air starting to catch to you as

00:41:47.592 --> 00:41:58.021
the opening begins to approach you: 100 feet, 50
feet, 30 feet. It's causing the sweat on your brow

00:41:58.021 --> 00:42:04.853
to feel really cold and freezing against your
skin, until eventually, as-- you're near the

00:42:04.853 --> 00:42:08.706
front, as is Yasha. What would you guys like to do
as you approach the exit?

00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:11.037
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace as we get
close.

00:42:12.397 --> 00:42:21.136
TALIESIN: (gravelly voice) I'm very carefully
going to scan the surroundings, listen for any

00:42:21.136 --> 00:42:23.662
noise. I'm going to slowly make my way up.

00:42:23.662 --> 00:42:25.759
LAURA: (clears throat loudly)

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.310
(laughter)

00:42:31.325 --> 00:42:38.527
TRAVIS: I will also look for any marks of climbing
devices, ropes, anything man-made or not man-made,

00:42:38.539 --> 00:42:44.000
but not natural near the top of this opening.
Yasha will.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.607
MATT: You do see two semi-rusted-- not terribly
rusted, but the very beginning stages of rust--

00:42:52.607 --> 00:43:02.091
iron pitons that are driven into the top of this.
You can see a portion of rope that was tied to it,

00:43:02.091 --> 00:43:05.998
that has since been severed, and there's some
dangling threads at the edge of that.

00:43:05.998 --> 00:43:10.214
TRAVIS: (high voice) We can use that-- (normal
voice) I'm not going to do Yasha's voice.

00:43:11.704 --> 00:43:14.880
I don't know. I started with me, then her--

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:21.935
LIAM: If Caduceus is listening intently, he is
barely hearing Caleb mouth the words to the

00:43:21.935 --> 00:43:26.357
Feather Fall spell like an actor running lines,
which he's been doing for the last 30 minutes.

00:43:27.337 --> 00:43:29.739
MATT: Are you just listening?

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:33.853
TALIESIN: I'm slowly creeping up and listening,
and taking in everything, seeing what--

00:43:33.853 --> 00:43:40.669
MATT: As your eyes adjust, and you listen out, you
can hear wind hitting bits of sand and dust

00:43:40.669 --> 00:43:50.676
occasionally. The temperature is chilled. It is a
cloudy sky, a familiar sky. It is the same sky

00:43:50.676 --> 00:43:59.424
that is in proximity to the Empire: gray, might
rain in the next day or two. As you glance over

00:43:59.424 --> 00:44:08.463
the edge, you can see you're on this subtle grade.
To your left as you look up, you can see the

00:44:08.463 --> 00:44:18.665
ominous, rising peaks of the the Ashkeeper Peaks
themselves. You can see that you are at the base

00:44:18.665 --> 00:44:26.377
of where the mountains begin to slowly grade into
the wastes, which you see to your right. There are

00:44:26.377 --> 00:44:33.631
dead trees. Whether it be they themselves are
bereft of life, or they've lost their leaves to

00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:40.394
the season, you're not familiar with this
territory to know-- yet. You can see clusters of

00:44:40.394 --> 00:44:46.245
rock and stone and areas where whatever force
created these mountains has caused bits of it to

00:44:46.246 --> 00:44:54.845
jut outward, causing small cliff faces and stone
protrusions that mar the base of the mountainscape

00:44:54.845 --> 00:45:02.403
here before you. You can see where strange types
of roots and small bushes have tried to affix

00:45:02.403 --> 00:45:07.778
themselves to the edges of these stones, and then
have dried up as the wastes themselves go through

00:45:07.778 --> 00:45:19.629
the dark and ashen seasons. Looking beyond that,
you can see the open valley below and before you:

00:45:19.629 --> 00:45:30.241
a dry, cracked, badlands with hints of scrub brush
and other types of hardy vegetation that has

00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:36.661
managed to find a life here. What did you roll for
perception, again?

00:45:36.661 --> 00:45:38.339
TALIESIN: I didn't roll perception.

00:45:38.339 --> 00:45:40.670
MATT: That's right, that's just you taking in the
scenery. Now roll a perception check.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.619
LIAM: Is Cad up there solo at this point?

00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:44.352
MATT: You send Frumpkin up to look?

00:45:44.352 --> 00:45:45.276
TALIESIN: 18.

00:45:45.276 --> 00:45:58.721
MATT: You do see, in the distance in the valley, a
few shapes far away, far past the mountain range,

00:45:58.721 --> 00:46:07.909
very large creatures of some kind stalking slowly
across. Far away, miles away.

00:46:07.909 --> 00:46:10.167
LAURA: Does Yasha recognize them?

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:16.053
MATT: Yasha doesn't see this yet. Yasha is just
peeking up. Roll a perception check for Yasha.

00:46:16.053 --> 00:46:22.406
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going to say, any signs of
beast nor man? Life or technology?

00:46:22.406 --> 00:46:24.890
TRAVIS: A natural 20.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.060
MATT: Really?

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.696
MARISHA: Sexy CR dice.

00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:43.402
MATT: Yasha does look up and see that as well.
"It's probably best to avoid those. They can bear

00:46:43.402 --> 00:46:48.841
"quite a bit of meat, but they're
a bit of a tussle."

00:46:50.301 --> 00:46:56.058
TALIESIN: Well, if you think so. Are we safe? Can
we bring everybody up?

00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:58.835
MATT: "I mean, it's either that or stay inside."

00:47:00.205 --> 00:47:06.313
TALIESIN: I've missed the sky. I think we can come
up, everybody. Just be careful.

00:47:07.152 --> 00:47:11.318
TRAVIS: Is there any cover nearby once we poke our
head up out there that you can see?

00:47:11.415 --> 00:47:16.341
TALIESIN: This doesn't seem to be much of a
coverage territory.

00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:19.347
TRAVIS: Okay. Anything in the skies?

00:47:20.257 --> 00:47:27.184
MATT: You look up. You can see a few hawks, maybe
birds of prey, but nothing at the moment that

00:47:27.184 --> 00:47:28.345
catches your attention.

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:31.105
LIAM: And this never stopped being the worm's
path, &lt;i&gt;ja&lt;/i&gt;?

00:47:31.705 --> 00:47:32.439
MATT: No.

00:47:33.039 --> 00:47:38.241
LIAM: Are there any signs of where the worm went
across this open land?

00:47:38.241 --> 00:47:39.899
MATT: Did you climb out?

00:47:39.899 --> 00:47:41.515
LIAM: I thought we all-- yes.

00:47:41.515 --> 00:47:43.194
MATT: All right. You all climb out.

00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:44.710
LAURA: Stealthily, sure.

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:49.750
MATT: Make a survival check to see if you can
locate the tracks here.

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:55.874
LIAM: Been rolling real well tonight. Eight.

00:47:56.904 --> 00:48:03.898
MATT: Unfortunately, as opposed to soft dirt, most
of the mountainscape here is hard rock and dust.

00:48:03.898 --> 00:48:10.111
There doesn't look like there's any sign of tracks
or pressure or shifting that would give you an

00:48:10.111 --> 00:48:15.375
idea of where it went. However, it does look like
it gradually rounds out as it exits, and this

00:48:15.376 --> 00:48:21.487
seems to be pretty easy to gather that this is the
exit point. Whatever troop it is that had made

00:48:21.487 --> 00:48:29.374
this incursion of Felderwin, this was their exit
point. You look around you. This is Xhorhas.

00:48:29.374 --> 00:48:33.281
Welcome to the eastern side in Eastern Wynandir.

00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:36.651
SAM: Welcome to Xhorhasic Park.

00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:38.087
MATT: Fuck!

00:48:38.088 --> 00:48:40.951
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: (humming off-key
Jurassic Park theme)

00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:46.325
TRAVIS: What was that discordant mess? Jeez. We
all jumped into different parts of the score!

00:48:46.325 --> 00:48:52.153
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (purposefully humming off-key
Jurassic Park theme)

00:48:53.393 --> 00:48:56.383
MARISHA: (sighs) Glad we had that moment.

00:48:57.373 --> 00:49:03.432
LIAM: Talking to Yasha: Is this what you are
accustomed to from home?

00:49:04.692 --> 00:49:19.283
MATT: "I mean, yes. I'm not from this area,
specifically, but these are the wastes."

00:49:20.623 --> 00:49:23.382
LIAM: I think you are our guide, all the same.

00:49:24.632 --> 00:49:37.236
MATT: "Well, I will do my best." She keeps her
weapon at the ready. There are some five-,

00:49:37.236 --> 00:49:41.926
ten-foot pieces of stone in stacks where pieces of
the mountain have either come free and come to

00:49:41.927 --> 00:49:47.649
rest here at the base that offer a little bit of
cover from immediate views of anything in the

00:49:47.649 --> 00:49:52.444
distance. Since you are keeping such a close eye
out there, you do notice that to the north of

00:49:52.444 --> 00:50:01.451
you-- as you emerge, looking over the valley, to
your left would be north. So where you guys have

00:50:01.451 --> 00:50:07.888
emerged here, somewhere in this area, you've come
out this side of the mountains, and looking

00:50:07.888 --> 00:50:20.956
north-way you can make out shapes of other broken,
mountainous-like structures. You gather, through

00:50:20.956 --> 00:50:26.652
conversation and the map you have at your
disposal, for them to be the Brokenveil Bluffs

00:50:26.652 --> 00:50:34.968
that surround and encompass the Brokenveil Marsh.
There's a valley or gorge between the teeth-like

00:50:34.968 --> 00:50:43.640
Bluffs and the Ashkeeper range. There's a strange
thing visible to you. Amongst the open,

00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:50.329
daylight-gray sky, right there in that valley, is
pitch night.

00:50:51.529 --> 00:50:53.548
LAURA: That's where Ghor Dranas is.

00:50:54.258 --> 00:50:56.495
SAM: Do we know that it's engulfed in darkness?

00:50:56.496 --> 00:50:57.601
LIAM and LAURA: Yes.

00:50:57.601 --> 00:50:59.127
TRAVIS: It's unnatural darkness?

00:50:59.127 --> 00:50:59.993
LIAM: Yes.

00:50:59.993 --> 00:51:03.111
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:51:03.701 --> 00:51:08.981
TALIESIN: Why this is an intelligence-based thing
is beyond me, but here we go. No. That's a one. I

00:51:08.981 --> 00:51:11.071
rolled a two, which means it's a one.

00:51:11.071 --> 00:51:18.336
MATT: Okay. You have no idea where you are.

00:51:18.336 --> 00:51:19.477
TALIESIN: That's fair.

00:51:19.478 --> 00:51:22.243
MATT: Or what that might be and what direction it
could be.

00:51:22.243 --> 00:51:23.345
TALIESIN: That's crazy.

00:51:23.345 --> 00:51:24.366
TRAVIS: What is?

00:51:24.367 --> 00:51:25.512
TALIESIN: That thing.

00:51:25.512 --> 00:51:28.290
MARISHA: Didn't we hear that the darkness was
expanding?

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:31.129
LAURA: We heard Ghor Dranas was always dark.

00:51:31.729 --> 00:51:35.321
MARISHA: I feel like we heard that the darkness
was expanding somewhere.

00:51:36.931 --> 00:51:43.965
MATT: Yasha pipes in and goes, "Ghor Dranas is
further east."

00:51:44.435 --> 00:51:45.450
LAURA: Oh, really?

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.017
SAM: That's not it?

00:51:47.307 --> 00:51:50.040
MATT: "No, this is right on the border of the
Empire."

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.586
TRAVIS: Well, that's promising.

00:51:51.686 --> 00:51:56.814
SAM: So whatever darkness is creeping farther than
the capital?

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:58.691
MATT: "I suppose."

00:51:59.461 --> 00:52:00.481
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:52:00.481 --> 00:52:05.205
MARISHA: Does it look localized, or does it look
like it starts and then it's ever-expanding?

00:52:05.205 --> 00:52:10.258
MATT: It looks localized. It's like there's a
strange sphere of shadow that is encompassing that

00:52:10.258 --> 00:52:12.821
entire valley in the center of the mountains.

00:52:13.482 --> 00:52:16.514
LIAM: So a dome, from our perspective?

00:52:16.514 --> 00:52:18.201
LAURA: How far away is it?

00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:23.098
MATT: You don't see necessarily a dome. What you
see is the mountain, and the cliffs, and the

00:52:23.098 --> 00:52:27.282
ground around just goes into shadow. It's a very
strange--

00:52:27.282 --> 00:52:29.925
LAURA: Like someone erased the world?

00:52:29.945 --> 00:52:31.784
MATT: Yeah, went over it with a marker.

00:52:31.784 --> 00:52:33.757
TALIESIN: Whoa. That's crazy.

00:52:33.757 --> 00:52:36.820
SAM: How many days' walk is it from here, do you
think?

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:42.597
MATT: From there, you'd probably guess it's
somewhere-- let me see here. From where you

00:52:42.597 --> 00:52:45.661
emerged, probably about two days.

00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:47.499
MARISHA: Two days?

00:52:47.759 --> 00:52:48.975
LAURA: To the darkness?

00:52:48.975 --> 00:52:55.673
MATT: Looking at the map, you can gather the path
of the Ashkeeper Peaks, and where the Brokenveil

00:52:55.673 --> 00:53:04.750
Bluffs are, that gorge, that valley where you see
that dark spot, is the Ashguard Garrison. As you

00:53:04.751 --> 00:53:09.190
begin to focus and look out there, you can see
that texture within there that looked like a

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:14.841
forest is not, because there are points of light
in it. There are, you can just barely see at the

00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:24.900
very edge of the horizon before you get to that
mountain range, what you can gather to be tents,

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:28.120
structures of some kind.

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:30.763
MARISHA: Does it look like a military front?

00:53:30.763 --> 00:53:37.648
MATT: It's too far to see, but the last you word
you had was the Ashguard Garrison had fallen to

00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:40.602
the Kryn Dynasty and was currently held by them.

00:53:40.602 --> 00:53:47.017
LIAM: And the Xhorhasian agent that we tussled
with in the sewers was able to make darkness on

00:53:47.017 --> 00:53:50.202
the spot, so it is a tactic they are able to use.

00:53:50.202 --> 00:53:53.384
LAURA: A whole bunch of them together could make a
lot of darkness.

00:53:53.384 --> 00:53:54.862
TRAVIS: We should get closer.

00:53:55.452 --> 00:53:56.627
LAURA: Should we?

00:53:56.627 --> 00:53:58.974
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation--

00:54:00.724 --> 00:54:01.809
TALIESIN: I love this!

00:54:01.809 --> 00:54:02.825
LAURA: Whoa, secrets!

00:54:02.825 --> 00:54:07.504
SAM: What? How are there secrets already? He
didn't do anything! He doesn't deserve this one.

00:54:07.505 --> 00:54:10.317
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond has a Discord.

00:54:10.317 --> 00:54:16.196
SAM: It does. D&amp;D Beyond is great, I love them,
but Laura, what are the artists' names who did

00:54:16.196 --> 00:54:17.903
those beautiful art prints?

00:54:17.903 --> 00:54:24.388
LIAM: They are-- open your mouth, I'll say it.
Matteo Scalera and Moreno Dinisio.

00:54:24.388 --> 00:54:30.827
TALIESIN: Okay. Really quickly, just for fun, I'm
going to cast Blindness.

00:54:32.037 --> 00:54:32.991
TRAVIS: What?

00:54:32.991 --> 00:54:34.002
SAM: On whom?

00:54:34.282 --> 00:54:35.342
TALIESIN: A guy.

00:54:35.842 --> 00:54:38.193
SAM: A guy? What guy?

00:54:38.403 --> 00:54:40.667
TALIESIN: It's a constitution save, 16.

00:54:41.467 --> 00:54:42.559
MATT: Natural 20.

00:54:42.639 --> 00:54:43.715
TALIESIN: He didn't.

00:54:43.715 --> 00:54:45.888
MATT: Natural 20 on the save, yeah.

00:54:45.888 --> 00:54:47.239
SAM and LAURA: Who?

00:54:47.239 --> 00:54:48.304
TRAVIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:54:48.314 --> 00:54:50.310
LAURA: Did we see what Caduceus was doing?

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:52.033
TALIESIN: I was just casting a spell at somebody.

00:54:52.033 --> 00:54:57.625
MATT: You guys turn and look over, and a little
ways up, maybe 30, 40 feet from where you are,

00:54:57.625 --> 00:55:08.167
from a cliff-like outcropping, maybe a small ten-,
15-foot cliff, a gray-cloaked and hooded figure

00:55:08.167 --> 00:55:10.324
that's standing there with one hand up.

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:13.156
TRAVIS: One hand up, like this, palm out?

00:55:13.157 --> 00:55:14.142
MATT: Palm out.

00:55:14.752 --> 00:55:19.558
SAM: Yasha, in your culture, does that mean, "I'm
going to kill you," or "please don't kill me"?

00:55:19.738 --> 00:55:24.828
MATT: Yasha goes, "In my culture we just kill if
need be. There's no pleasantries."

00:55:24.828 --> 00:55:28.278
TRAVIS: I'm going to use Misty Step to bamf right
to him.

00:55:28.948 --> 00:55:30.185
MARISHA: That's cool.

00:55:30.186 --> 00:55:34.959
MATT: All right. You appear right in front and the
figure flinches as you do, and the hand

00:55:34.959 --> 00:55:39.671
instinctually looks to be probably going for a
blade inside the cloak and holds it there.

00:55:39.671 --> 00:55:44.312
TRAVIS: I summon the falchion. Who are you and
what do you want?

00:55:44.942 --> 00:55:52.812
MATT: The figure reaches up and pulls the hood
back a bit. You see a bald human. Big, bushy,

00:55:52.812 --> 00:56:04.196
black and gray beard, face covered with streaks of
mud. Looks to be a well-armored-- leather, studded

00:56:04.196 --> 00:56:15.993
leathers-- figure. Looks to you with these very
piercing, blue-gray eyes, taking your check and

00:56:15.993 --> 00:56:23.162
doesn't crumble under it. Holds the line and looks
back at you and says, "Hey, what are you doing out

00:56:23.162 --> 00:56:25.846
here? You don't look like soldiers."

00:56:27.016 --> 00:56:30.009
TRAVIS: We're not. We're a rescue party.

00:56:30.869 --> 00:56:32.612
MATT: "What you coming to rescue?"

00:56:33.012 --> 00:56:39.251
TRAVIS: A friend. What about you? Lonely place to
be up on the side of a mountain all by yourself.

00:56:40.491 --> 00:56:44.350
MATT: "Come, let's get out of the open, at least,
if we're going to talk."

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:45.959
TRAVIS: You have others with you?

00:56:45.959 --> 00:56:47.165
MATT: "I do."

00:56:47.166 --> 00:56:48.552
TRAVIS: How many?

00:56:50.232 --> 00:56:59.903
MATT: He whistles a little bit, and in the
surrounding rocks above, about ten other figures

00:56:59.903 --> 00:57:07.341
with similar gray cloaks all emerge, many of them
with shortbows and longbows, arrows nocked

00:57:07.341 --> 00:57:08.920
but not drawn yet.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:10.828
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool.

00:57:10.828 --> 00:57:15.316
TRAVIS: I motion to the rest. Let's go. This way.

00:57:15.956 --> 00:57:16.696
SAM: Okay.

00:57:17.316 --> 00:57:19.509
LAURA: Are they nice? Is it nice people?

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:20.976
SAM: It it the sand people?

00:57:21.616 --> 00:57:23.178
TRAVIS: The sand people?

00:57:23.178 --> 00:57:24.752
SAM: Is it the sand people?

00:57:26.202 --> 00:57:34.783
MATT: He leads you off to an alcove, maybe 15, 20
feet off from where you guys emerged. There's a

00:57:34.783 --> 00:57:42.317
stone structure that curls around and gives this
slight little pocket where 60 to 70 percent of you

00:57:42.317 --> 00:57:46.965
are covered by rock and not immediately visible,
except for what's immediately in front of you and

00:57:46.965 --> 00:57:52.905
further down the mountainside. It's a little wide
space. Pulls you in as the rest of the other

00:57:52.905 --> 00:58:02.954
figures slowly duck back into their hiding spaces.
"All right, so I'm Kaulden."

00:58:04.604 --> 00:58:06.703
LAURA: Is that with a C or with a K?

00:58:06.703 --> 00:58:07.756
MATT: "It's with a K."

00:58:07.756 --> 00:58:08.558
LAURA: Got it.

00:58:11.959 --> 00:58:16.638
MATT: "I'm the captain of the Muck Men, the small
band of scouts and rangers you see here. We're up

00:58:16.638 --> 00:58:17.923
"from Bladegarden."

00:58:19.133 --> 00:58:20.145
LAURA: Oh!

00:58:21.745 --> 00:58:23.261
TALIESIN: That means something to you?

00:58:23.262 --> 00:58:25.009
TRAVIS: Bladegarden is right here.

00:58:25.009 --> 00:58:27.866
LAURA: That means they're not from Xhorhas,
is what it means.

00:58:27.866 --> 00:58:28.751
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

00:58:28.751 --> 00:58:30.605
TRAVIS: On the other side of the Peaks.

00:58:30.605 --> 00:58:35.554
MATT: "We scout along the Ashkeepers, one of many
troops keeping an eye on enemy movements.

00:58:35.554 --> 00:58:38.539
"You shouldn't be wandering around here in a war
zone. You know that, right?"

00:58:38.839 --> 00:58:39.886
TRAVIS: Indeed.

00:58:39.887 --> 00:58:41.368
LAURA: We didn't have a choice.

00:58:42.488 --> 00:58:48.634
TRAVIS: We are far, far from home. As I said,
we're a rescue party. It's a matter of necessity,

00:58:48.634 --> 00:58:49.530
I'm afraid.

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:52.540
MATT: "This one you're rescuing, whereabouts
are they?"

00:58:53.171 --> 00:58:54.457
TRAVIS: That we don't know.

00:58:54.457 --> 00:58:57.303
LAURA: We think they're in Ghor Dranas?

00:58:58.493 --> 00:59:01.924
SAM: Or maybe in that dark city over there,
maybe?

00:59:01.924 --> 00:59:07.401
MATT: "Ooh, you'd probably have a better time in
Ghor Dranas right now."

00:59:09.511 --> 00:59:18.918
MARISHA: We're not looking for a Xhorhasian party.
Did you happen to see any higher-echelon-looking

00:59:18.918 --> 00:59:22.212
mage folk come through, maybe a week or two ago?

00:59:22.212 --> 00:59:24.261
SAM: Maybe with a big worm?

00:59:24.261 --> 00:59:25.916
MARISHA: Purple worm, real big.

00:59:25.916 --> 00:59:30.469
MATT: "We've seen a worm move through, about a
week and a half ago. Went far east, straight

00:59:30.469 --> 00:59:31.764
"across the plain."

00:59:31.764 --> 00:59:33.746
SAM: Towards that dark place?

00:59:33.976 --> 00:59:36.480
MATT: "No, that's northward. This went eastward."

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.011
LAURA: To probably Ghor Dranas, yeah.

00:59:39.011 --> 00:59:40.778
SAM: Is that toward Ghor Dranas?

00:59:41.638 --> 00:59:45.810
MATT: "As far as I know, that's probably where
it was headed."

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.558
TRAVIS: That would be the direction we're
supposed to go.

00:59:50.158 --> 00:59:52.241
LIAM: What can you tell us of the war?

00:59:53.502 --> 01:00:03.471
MATT: "Well, since the Ashguard was taken over a
month ago, they've been holding it. We've had a

01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:10.054
"few scuffles holding the line. There's been one
attempted incursion at the Rockguard Garrison.

01:00:12.254 --> 01:00:24.287
"It's been quiet to an uncomfortable degree. After
all these months of violence and death, to just be

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:32.207
"holding the line makes me uncomfortable. Makes me
wonder what they're waiting for. That's what we've

01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:38.945
"been doing, and a few other troops: keeping an
eye, taking a tally on what's being planned."

01:00:39.305 --> 01:00:44.404
TALIESIN: You know what happened at the other end
of this tunnel, or has word not traveled yet?

01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:48.234
MATT: "I have an idea. What's this? Was this made
by that worm?"

01:00:48.614 --> 01:00:49.941
TALIESIN: Well, yeah.

01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:58.815
SAM: They dug into a town called Felderwin, and
they raided it and took prisoners.

01:01:00.785 --> 01:01:06.661
MATT: "Hmm, I'll see if I can request a few more
parties out here looking for this. If this is

01:01:06.661 --> 01:01:14.390
"going to be their way of going past the boundaries
of the Empire, that's a bad thing. All right,

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:19.508
"well, let me gather the rest of the Muck Men.
We'll see what we can do to maybe escort you back

01:01:19.516 --> 01:01:20.834
"into the Empire."

01:01:20.934 --> 01:01:28.251
SAM: Oh, we're not going back. We're going to pursue
the one that we're trying to rescue across the--

01:01:29.191 --> 01:01:30.799
MATT: "Just the seven of you?"

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.918
LAURA: You're welcome to join us.

01:01:32.928 --> 01:01:35.505
MATT: (laughs) "I'm not stupid, but thanks."

01:01:36.635 --> 01:01:42.055
TRAVIS: What do you know about the area of darkness over there? Have you gone nearn it? Nearn it.

01:01:42.095 --> 01:01:47.435
(laughter)

01:01:47.605 --> 01:01:54.360
MATT: "As far as I know, the Kryn have some sort
of a spell that brings them consistent twilight.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:05.412
"They tend to move best under the shadow. Sun
doesn't really behoove them well. It's a bit

01:02:05.412 --> 01:02:09.410
"difficult if they're bringing the night with them
wherever they go."

01:02:10.231 --> 01:02:15.074
TRAVIS: Does it move with them, or does that area
of darkness stay in one place?

01:02:15.074 --> 01:02:19.316
MATT: "As far as I know, since that darkness
opened when they took the garrison, it's been

01:02:19.316 --> 01:02:20.448
"there ever since."

01:02:20.879 --> 01:02:22.008
MARISHA: Interesting.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:28.089
TRAVIS: Right, so we go under the darkness, rid
them of that spell, and we'll be lickety-split out

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:29.371
of there no problem.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:33.271
LAURA: We're not going to the garrison. We're
going to rescue Yeza.

01:02:33.567 --> 01:02:35.668
TRAVIS: I'm being sarcastic, Jester.

01:02:37.758 --> 01:02:45.151
LIAM: We will have to deal with this problem
further into Xhorhas. Do you have any tips for a

01:02:45.152 --> 01:02:48.122
bunch of crazy assholes going into the enemy's
country?

01:02:48.482 --> 01:02:56.493
MATT: (sighs) "Stay out of sight. I mean, there's
the beast men. There's all sorts of strange

01:02:56.493 --> 01:03:04.524
"creatures that scour these wastes, looking for
things that move, things that feed. Don't wander

01:03:04.524 --> 01:03:09.051
"too close into the marshes." He points down, and
you can see now-- and you caught this a little

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:14.889
bit. Where on the north side along this range, to
the left of where you are, there is the bluffs and

01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:18.862
the Ashguard Garrison. To the right, the mountain
range curves around, miles and miles down, and

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:25.326
meets with what you can now see to be a large
lake. There is this darkened bit of land around.

01:03:25.326 --> 01:03:34.701
It could be a forest, but he points it out to be a
marshland. "If you're looking to cross the river,

01:03:34.701 --> 01:03:42.139
"heading up that way, just be careful. Gets wide at
some points. Gets a little thinner at others, but

01:03:42.139 --> 01:03:44.460
"it's still crossing a river."

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:48.569
TALIESIN: Know if there's any way to buy some
horses or some such?

01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:53.660
MATT: "I mean, unless you want to go and wander
into one of the various Xhorhasian towns and buy

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.183
"off a horse or three, good luck."

01:03:57.324 --> 01:03:59.091
TALIESIN: Everybody got to eat.

01:04:02.691 --> 01:04:03.778
MATT: "Anyway."

01:04:05.428 --> 01:04:10.680
SAM: Would that darkened area that we're not going
to-- what is it called? Is that Ashguard?

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:17.661
MATT: "That's the Ashguard, aye. Well, if you're
going to go off and be fools that side of this

01:04:17.661 --> 01:04:19.376
"land, do you need any supplies?"

01:04:19.376 --> 01:04:22.079
LAURA: What do you have? Yes, give us anything you
have.

01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:24.334
SAM: Yes, give us, for free, anything that you have.

01:04:24.334 --> 01:04:26.424
LAURA: I would love that. So nice of you.

01:04:26.574 --> 01:04:31.882
MATT: "Aye. Hold here a second." He walks out of
the alcove and heads out into the space where the

01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:37.038
rest of his Muck Men are. Steps up onto this one
piece of stone and gives a little whistle to the

01:04:37.038 --> 01:04:42.896
rest of the troop. They all stand up, and he looks
back to you and beckons for you to start to head

01:04:42.896 --> 01:04:48.217
over to where they are. At which point you see
something go (soft whistle) through the air,

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:53.412
something shift real fast. You watch him double
over onto one knee. You can see the edge of an

01:04:53.412 --> 01:04:54.999
arrow protruding from his chest.

01:04:54.999 --> 01:04:55.941
SAM: Who, our guy?

01:04:55.941 --> 01:04:57.408
MARISHA: Fuck. Get down!

01:04:58.558 --> 01:05:04.234
MATT: You see other numerous arrows begin to
suddenly pelt the area where they have been

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:08.473
congregating. He immediately looks up in that
direction. You don't quite see where they're

01:05:08.473 --> 01:05:11.875
coming from yet. He looks back to you and goes,
"Gods curse them! Stay out of sight!"

01:05:11.876 --> 01:05:14.305
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on Kaulden.

01:05:14.305 --> 01:05:19.223
MATT: Oh no, he is a ways away from you guys. He
left the alcove and went up on a rock.

01:05:19.223 --> 01:05:21.605
LAURA: Okay, shit. Can we hide?

01:05:21.895 --> 01:05:23.529
MARISHA: Are we still by the hole?

01:05:23.529 --> 01:05:28.093
MATT: You guys are still in the alcove right now,
yes. You hear (arrow impacts) hitting rocks and

01:05:28.093 --> 01:05:30.658
smashing against them. You hear bolts
and other things.

01:05:30.659 --> 01:05:32.753
LAURA: Can we see where they're coming from?

01:05:32.753 --> 01:05:35.230
MATT: Make a perception check if you want to go
look.

01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:36.126
MARISHA: Fuck.

01:05:36.126 --> 01:05:39.529
LAURA: Oh, come on! That was so good, but it's
nine.

01:05:44.429 --> 01:05:48.766
MATT: You don't see anything at the moment,
partially because you're trying to also keep out

01:05:48.766 --> 01:05:56.608
of sight. You hear it, Caduceus, at first, this
familiar, growling gibbering.

01:05:59.508 --> 01:06:01.308
MARISHA: Gnolls.

01:06:01.308 --> 01:06:02.223
SAM: More gnolls?

01:06:02.223 --> 01:06:04.054
LAURA: Ah, I hate them.

01:06:05.584 --> 01:06:09.910
MATT: At which point, those of you who are
glancing around can see, beyond them, there are a

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:15.520
number of other groups of large stones where
occasionally you see, jumping up from behind,

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:21.268
these large, humanoid, furred gnolls with longbows
that are releasing volley after volley towards

01:06:21.268 --> 01:06:25.933
them. You cannot really see the rest of the Muck
Men or the state that things are in right now, but

01:06:25.933 --> 01:06:31.453
they're returning fire left and right. Are you
guys staying put and staying out of sight?

01:06:32.283 --> 01:06:34.471
You don't seem to have caught their attention.

01:06:34.472 --> 01:06:37.087
TRAVIS: No, we're fucking engaging these fucking
things.

01:06:37.087 --> 01:06:39.899
SAM: We don't even know which direction they're
coming from.

01:06:39.899 --> 01:06:41.379
MARISHA: Or how many there are.

01:06:41.379 --> 01:06:45.942
TALIESIN: Can we see where they're coming from, or
do we have any sense of how far away they are?

01:06:45.942 --> 01:06:53.326
MATT: You've seen a few of them around, maybe 50
or 60 feet away, from around one section of stone.

01:06:53.326 --> 01:06:57.520
TRAVIS: What are Kaulden's men doing? Are they
breaking to move and take off, or are they

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.233
hunkering down and trying to defend?

01:06:59.233 --> 01:07:03.528
MATT: Right now, you cannot see from this alcove.
If you want to try to look out and make a

01:07:03.528 --> 01:07:05.480
perception check to keep an eye, you can.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:10.985
LIAM: Because we were alone with Kaulden in here,
didn't his troops sink back in their hiding spots at all?

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:15.610
MATT: They did, and then he whistled to call them
up from their places when you guys were about to

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:16.512
engage for trade.

01:07:16.512 --> 01:07:17.560
TRAVIS: A natural one.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.850
MARISHA: Fuck.

01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:20.918
TALIESIN: I say we try and help.

01:07:22.598 --> 01:07:24.410
SAM: Sure. We need to get out of here.

01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:29.321
MARISHA: How far away is the rock towards where
Kaulden's people are?

01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.560
MATT: Let me show you.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.464
SAM: Hey!

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.985
MATT: You haven't engaged yet, but I'm going to
give you a lay of the land.

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:37.076
TALIESIN: I'm just happy that there's a map.

01:07:37.076 --> 01:07:41.550
SAM: We're getting a map. D&amp;D Beyond does have a
Discord channel you can check out at

01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:52.595
dndbeyond.com/discord. I hope everyone watching
the show right now is making out with each other.

01:07:52.595 --> 01:08:00.352
No matter if you're just friends, casual
acquaintances at a bar, family members. It's

01:08:00.353 --> 01:08:04.305
Valentine's Day; let the love flow.

01:08:04.305 --> 01:08:06.379
ALL: Whoa!

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.569
LAURA: Is it green or is the light green?

01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:10.378
MATT and TALIESIN: The light is green.

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:11.583
LAURA: It looks so green!

01:08:13.183 --> 01:08:17.207
MATT: This is actually on a mountain. There is a
slight incline.

01:08:18.447 --> 01:08:20.142
SAM: Raked stage.

01:08:20.142 --> 01:08:24.367
MARISHA: Woo! Oh, it is, yeah.

01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:29.176
MATT: You guys are all pressed into this alcove
over here.

01:08:29.176 --> 01:08:32.086
MARISHA: Do I need to look up the difference
between downstage and upstage?

01:08:32.086 --> 01:08:33.353
LIAM: If we have to.

01:08:37.122 --> 01:08:38.602
LAURA: Anybody want some candy?

01:08:38.602 --> 01:08:39.746
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:08:39.746 --> 01:08:46.199
LAURA: Sorry, he threw me off. Stop it, Sam.
Here.

01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:50.989
TRAVIS: That was a really bad throw.

01:08:53.249 --> 01:08:58.781
MATT: From this perspective, you can see Kaulden
over here. You begin to hear some other voices

01:08:58.781 --> 01:09:12.267
shout out, (foreign words). You hear some sort of
energy streak, (impacts and grunting). Not gnoll-like.

01:09:12.897 --> 01:09:14.140
Something else.

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:19.567
SAM: I'm going to cast Invisibility on myself, and
I'm going to run out there and look.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:26.352
MATT: Nott, you cast Invisibility, and you go out
and look.

01:09:26.942 --> 01:09:28.519
SAM: What do I see?

01:09:28.519 --> 01:09:33.293
MATT: As you come around the corner and glance,
you can see across the way the group of gnolls

01:09:33.292 --> 01:09:40.335
that are currently behind that way. You can see
two of them with their blade out and a shield.

01:09:40.335 --> 01:09:46.274
They're both rushing from around the corner
towards where the rest of Kaulden's men are.

01:09:46.285 --> 01:09:51.971
Suddenly, they all reach around a side of the rock
and release a volley. You see both gnolls take a

01:09:51.971 --> 01:09:56.910
bunch to the chest and keep running, but begin to
slow. A second volley. One of them shouts out,

01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:02.072
"Fire!" They release a secondary volley. Both of
them fall and crumple to their knees. They're both

01:10:02.072 --> 01:10:09.320
killed as they rush by. However, what you do see
is around the way, this one member of this team

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:17.705
suddenly crumple to the ground, weapon clatter out
of out their hand. Curling around the way, the

01:10:17.705 --> 01:10:28.818
familiar, insect-like Kryn armor of some sort of a
Kryn warrior comes around the rock. It darts

01:10:28.818 --> 01:10:36.471
forward and leaps upwards and strikes downward,
hitting another one of them. As it does, suddenly

01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:45.888
two copies of itself made of somewhat immaterial,
shadow-like energy also apparate and strike down

01:10:45.889 --> 01:10:50.897
in rapid succession, all three strikes cleaving down
into one of the other members of the group, who

01:10:50.897 --> 01:10:53.763
immediately is cut and falls to the ground.

01:10:54.973 --> 01:11:01.286
LIAM: Caleb casts Tongues as soon as he hears the
foreign language out. He's got that small clay

01:11:01.286 --> 01:11:02.362
model of the ziggurat.

01:11:02.362 --> 01:11:04.886
MATT: Okay, so you begin casting Tongues on yourself?

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.007
LIAM: Yeah, one action.

01:11:06.007 --> 01:11:11.674
MATT: You also watch around this corner
another Kryn figure with less, more decorative

01:11:11.674 --> 01:11:20.147
armor. Not the heavy carapace-type blackened
armor, but just shoulder pieces and a helmet, and

01:11:20.147 --> 01:11:25.739
dark gray robes that billow as the wind blows by,
stepping up with a large staff. As the figure

01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:33.333
seems to draw this gray-like energy from the air
around you, a familiar gray energy that, as it

01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:41.241
pulls through, it strikes the ground and this thin
black line of energy streaks across the ground.

01:11:41.572 --> 01:11:47.496
Suddenly all the rocks within ten feet of it shoot
to the center, being pulled out of heavy

01:11:47.496 --> 01:11:53.772
gravitational energy to the center as these
figures right here are also pulled in, the rocks

01:11:53.772 --> 01:12:00.622
crushing and pelting them, this line of gravitational
tug jamming them for 100 feet out this way.

01:12:00.622 --> 01:12:02.447
LIAM: Gravity and time.

01:12:02.447 --> 01:12:10.419
MARISHA: Yeah. I think it was the sewers under
Zadash, right, the last time we sawâ

01:12:10.419 --> 01:12:12.452
SAM: Is that where we saw the gray energy?

01:12:12.452 --> 01:12:15.070
MARISHA: The dark orb? Remember, we
kept thinking it was an orb of death?

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:20.617
LAURA: Oh god, yeah, that's right. Oh my god. Are
they all going to die if we don't--

01:12:20.618 --> 01:12:28.074
MATT: Both of these figures get crushed into themselves
their bodies suddenly folded into a sphere of bone

01:12:28.074 --> 01:12:32.835
and skin before they're flung to the ground, where
bits of the stone and rock that were jammed into

01:12:32.836 --> 01:12:38.581
their bodies slightly come loose and tumble to the
ground as the gravitational pull vanishes. One is

01:12:38.581 --> 01:12:43.774
still surviving from behind and ducks behind. You
can see blood running from this brass dragonborn

01:12:43.774 --> 01:12:49.060
as this dark blood's running from the nose and the
ear and under the eye. It's trying to pull another

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.463
arrow. Are you guys doing anything?

01:12:51.463 --> 01:12:59.016
SAM: I'm going to call back: Mighty Nein, follow my
voice! I'll lead them. I'll go over near that

01:12:59.016 --> 01:13:00.321
cactus-looking thing over there.

01:13:00.322 --> 01:13:03.173
MARISHA: There's no way they don't eventually find
us, right?

01:13:03.173 --> 01:13:04.985
LAURA: Yeah, they're going to find us.

01:13:04.985 --> 01:13:08.753
SAM: Yeah. That seems like cover over there,
right? Do I see any bad guys right there?

01:13:08.753 --> 01:13:13.565
MATT: No, actually, what you see is-- so this is
where Kaulden is, and this is where another one

01:13:13.565 --> 01:13:14.824
of the cloaked figures is.

01:13:15.104 --> 01:13:17.133
LAURA: Should we pop out and do something?

01:13:17.133 --> 01:13:18.590
SAM: Bad news, everyone out!

01:13:18.591 --> 01:13:23.171
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bless, by the way, because
we have a moment, on you, Yasha, and Beau.

01:13:23.171 --> 01:13:25.413
MARISHA: (whispering) Oh, fuck yeah! Thank you.

01:13:25.413 --> 01:13:28.428
LIAM: I'm going to grab the leather thong
and cast Mage Armor.

01:13:28.429 --> 01:13:33.201
LAURA: I'm going to cast Bless on-- who didn't
get it? Anybody that didn't get it. Fjord?

01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:36.068
TALIESIN: No, Fjord got it. It was Fjord, Yasha,
and Beau.

01:13:36.068 --> 01:13:43.085
LAURA: Oh, okay. Nott and Caleb and-- do I have to
be able to see you? No, of my choice within range.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.581
SAM: You don't know where I am.

01:13:45.831 --> 01:13:47.356
LAURA: It's within range!

01:13:48.186 --> 01:13:50.625
MATT: Does it say a target you can see?

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.572
LAURA: No, a target within range.

01:13:53.322 --> 01:13:57.749
MATT: Wherever you are, Nott, you're blessed.
You're getting blessed instead of who? Oh, fromâ

01:13:57.749 --> 01:13:59.367
LAURA: I'm blessing Caduceus.

01:13:59.367 --> 01:14:02.462
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll take that. You're the only one
without Bless.

01:14:02.462 --> 01:14:03.814
MARISHA: 1d4, right?

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.762
TALIESIN: Yeah, 1d4 to saves and attacks.

01:14:05.762 --> 01:14:07.007
SAM: Awesome.

01:14:07.587 --> 01:14:08.952
MATT: There you go.

01:14:08.952 --> 01:14:11.062
LAURA: Basically everyone but me is blessed.

01:14:11.062 --> 01:14:12.885
MATT: Everybody but you? I misunderstood.

01:14:12.886 --> 01:14:14.700
SAM: #EverybodyButMeIsBlessed.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:23.404
MATT: That's amazing. There we go.

01:14:24.904 --> 01:14:29.349
TRAVIS: From our position, can we see-- I can't
see on the other side of that rock-- the person

01:14:29.349 --> 01:14:31.358
up at the top. Is that friend or foe?

01:14:31.358 --> 01:14:36.035
MATT: That's Kaulden. He's currently against
the rock with the arrow in his chest, going (panting).

01:14:36.035 --> 01:14:39.029
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll run out of the cave
and run in his direction.

01:14:39.029 --> 01:14:41.359
MATT: Okay. Are you doing this not to be seen orâ

01:14:41.359 --> 01:14:46.167
LAURA: Are we doing anything? Should we jump out
and attack? Because we would get a surprise attack if

01:14:46.167 --> 01:14:47.926
someone jumps out and does something.

01:14:47.926 --> 01:14:51.068
SAM: Yeah, but we don't know where any of them are.
You guys don't.

01:14:51.068 --> 01:14:53.398
LAURA: If you came out, you would see it, though.

01:14:53.398 --> 01:14:54.539
LIAM: We just hear shit.

01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:56.321
MARISHA: I'm down for a big attack.

01:14:56.321 --> 01:14:57.566
MATT: It's up to you guys.

01:14:57.566 --> 01:15:00.661
LAURA: I'm just saying, if we jump out and
attack, we'd get a surprise.

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.059
MARISHA: I would think so.

01:15:02.059 --> 01:15:04.902
LAURA: Right? Oh, they're in combat, so they
wouldn't be surprised.

01:15:04.902 --> 01:15:06.093
MATT: It's not an ambush.

01:15:06.093 --> 01:15:10.607
LIAM: It's a condition; it's not something that we
do. I learn, after 115 episodes.

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:13.276
LAURA: Okay, well then, never mind. Do whatever
you want.

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:14.706
MATT: What are you guys doing?

01:15:14.707 --> 01:15:15.618
MARISHA: Attacking!

01:15:15.618 --> 01:15:20.423
MATT: You're attacking, all right. Then roll initiative
if you guys are going to jump into this fight.

01:15:20.423 --> 01:15:22.705
LAURA: These guys are really powerful, you guys.

01:15:22.705 --> 01:15:24.044
MARISHA: They look powerful.

01:15:27.964 --> 01:15:29.318
SAM: Here we go!

01:15:29.319 --> 01:15:31.545
TALIESIN: This is not going to go terribly.

01:15:33.405 --> 01:15:36.351
SAM and LAURA: They're super powerful.

01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:39.369
TRAVIS: Stretch your legs. Here we go.

01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:40.445
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:15:42.665 --> 01:15:43.531
MATT: Perfect.

01:15:51.671 --> 01:15:54.204
LAURA: If things go poorly, head for the hole.

01:15:55.204 --> 01:15:57.179
SAM: (singing) Head for the hole.

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.559
LIAM: This Valentine's Day.

01:15:59.739 --> 01:16:00.759
MATT: 25 to 20?

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.513
SAM: Ouch.

01:16:02.533 --> 01:16:03.958
MATT: 20 to 15?

01:16:03.958 --> 01:16:05.201
MARISHA and LIAM: 19.

01:16:05.201 --> 01:16:06.227
TALIESIN: 15.

01:16:12.097 --> 01:16:13.411
MATT: So it's 19, 19?

01:16:13.411 --> 01:16:14.449
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:20.200
LIAM: Sorry, sound guy.

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.125
MARISHA: Sorry, Chris.

01:16:25.935 --> 01:16:27.837
SAM: Guys, Critical Role, am I right?

01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:28.727
MATT: 15 to ten?

01:16:28.847 --> 01:16:30.135
TRAVIS: Fjord had a 14.

01:16:31.676 --> 01:16:33.058
LAURA: Jester had a 12.

01:16:34.748 --> 01:16:37.166
SAM: 11 for me, if we're down that far.

01:16:37.167 --> 01:16:38.169
MATT: Yasha got what?

01:16:38.169 --> 01:16:39.108
TRAVIS: Five.

01:16:39.418 --> 01:16:41.839
LAURA: Aww, on brand.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.059
LIAM: Where's blink dog at?

01:16:44.059 --> 01:16:45.763
MARISHA: Wait, where you at, Nott?

01:16:45.763 --> 01:16:46.781
SAM: 11.

01:16:46.781 --> 01:16:48.549
LAURA: He's still attached to my hip.

01:16:49.079 --> 01:16:50.369
SAM: With the other animal?

01:16:52.949 --> 01:17:02.027
MATT: First, this one Kryn warrior figure moves up
at the top. Suddenly their form seems to shimmer

01:17:02.027 --> 01:17:09.404
and split off, and another shadow-energy version
of them appears not too far from where they stand.

01:17:11.754 --> 01:17:19.652
The figure then rushes towards this one, leaps off
towards it, and as it strikes down towards the air

01:17:19.652 --> 01:17:24.756
with its blade, the shadow figure tends to reach
out and grab its arm to hold it in place. As the

01:17:24.756 --> 01:17:31.240
figure's trying to run away with its bow in hand,
it gets held there in the moment by the shadow, it

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:36.955
looks like, as it looks up just in time for the
large armored figure to come down with a

01:17:36.955 --> 01:17:42.295
greatsword. Two other shadow versions appear with
similar greatswords and all come down towards it.

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:45.234
LAURA: Should we back off? We should--

01:17:45.234 --> 01:17:48.310
MATT: That's a hit, and that's a hit.

01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:50.497
SAM: Oh shit.

01:17:50.497 --> 01:17:52.963
LAURA: Y'all, this might be a really bad idea.

01:17:53.273 --> 01:17:54.823
SAM: Where are we going to go?

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:58.096
LAURA: I don't know; they would find us! Oh god--

01:17:58.096 --> 01:18:04.241
MATT: Both arms are cut off, and where the torso
is, the greatsword jams itself down about 12

01:18:04.242 --> 01:18:11.539
inches past the clavicle in the chest. The warrior
kicks the body off of the blade and splats onto

01:18:11.539 --> 01:18:12.884
the rocky ground behind.

01:18:12.884 --> 01:18:14.003
TALIESIN: Oh man.

01:18:14.003 --> 01:18:15.594
MARISHA: The two fucking--

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:18.023
SAM: Should we talk to them?

01:18:19.943 --> 01:18:22.554
TRAVIS: (laughing) Should we talk to them! I love
it.

01:18:22.554 --> 01:18:24.046
MATT: Beau, you're up next.

01:18:24.046 --> 01:18:25.870
MARISHA: Oh no!

01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:28.247
TRAVIS: Have no fear.

01:18:29.477 --> 01:18:31.196
TALIESIN: I feel a lot of fear.

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:36.663
MARISHA: Can I jump over the wall that I'm-- the
whole wall?

01:18:36.663 --> 01:18:39.865
MATT: Yeah. You'll lose about ten feet of movement
to get over the top, but you can do that.

01:18:40.795 --> 01:18:44.886
MARISHA: I mean, it'd be pretty much the same to
run around. I'm going to do that!

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:48.146
TALIESIN: We have all those archers that we need
to deal with.

01:18:48.146 --> 01:18:49.132
MARISHA: Wait, what?

01:18:49.132 --> 01:18:51.344
TALIESIN: All those gnoll archers.

01:18:51.345 --> 01:18:52.291
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:54.622
MATT: It's ten feet of movement to get up
onto it.

01:18:54.622 --> 01:18:56.387
TALIESIN: That's five archers. Jesus.

01:18:56.387 --> 01:19:00.898
MATT: As you step up onto the edge, you watch the
warrior after it kicks its blade off. The two

01:19:00.899 --> 01:19:06.492
shadow clones of it blink out of existence, and
the helmet looks right up at you. You've

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:08.872
definitely made yourself known. What are you
doing?

01:19:08.872 --> 01:19:12.268
MARISHA: (exhales) I'm going for the main
motherfucker.

01:19:13.188 --> 01:19:14.222
MATT: Over here?

01:19:14.222 --> 01:19:15.259
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:19:15.259 --> 01:19:16.683
MATT: Okay. That's ten.

01:19:16.683 --> 01:19:18.519
MARISHA: How much movement do I have?

01:19:18.519 --> 01:19:20.603
MATT: You have 35 feet still.

01:19:20.953 --> 01:19:25.495
MARISHA: I can make it, right? That's 35 feet, it
looks like. Jump!

01:19:25.495 --> 01:19:31.622
MATT: That's another five, so you have 30 left.
Make an acrobatics check to try and land properly.

01:19:32.712 --> 01:19:34.061
It's a low DC.

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:35.882
MARISHA: (counting) 30. I could do it.

01:19:35.882 --> 01:19:37.402
SAM: What a cute dress.

01:19:37.402 --> 01:19:42.124
MARISHA: Thank you. (whispers) Uk'otoa. (normal
voice) What was it? Acrobatics?

01:19:42.124 --> 01:19:44.644
TRAVIS: Calling out his name for good luck? I got
you.

01:19:44.644 --> 01:19:45.423
MARISHA: 22.

01:19:45.423 --> 01:19:50.826
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You barely even touch the
ground and keep rushing from that point. 25, 30.

01:19:50.826 --> 01:19:56.272
You've just enough movement to get right adjacent
to him. As you rush up, you can see within the

01:19:56.272 --> 01:20:01.619
helmet, what little bit of the metal is not
covering the eyes, you can see the drow skin tone

01:20:01.619 --> 01:20:07.581
from beneath, the very angry and intense eyes
staring back at you. You can see the cheeks and

01:20:07.581 --> 01:20:10.032
the eyes curl up into a smile. What do you do?

01:20:10.032 --> 01:20:12.476
LAURA: Oh, he's smiling! This is bad!

01:20:12.552 --> 01:20:17.710
MARISHA: I smile back, give him a little wink. I'm
going to do an upper elbow to his jawline and then

01:20:17.711 --> 01:20:18.835
go for the ribs.

01:20:18.835 --> 01:20:19.656
MATT: Go for it.

01:20:19.656 --> 01:20:21.339
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like the combo!

01:20:21.819 --> 01:20:23.166
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

01:20:23.556 --> 01:20:24.652
LAURA: Natural 20.

01:20:24.773 --> 01:20:27.620
MARISHA: Not good. It's okay.

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:28.974
SAM: Bless?

01:20:28.975 --> 01:20:36.479
MARISHA: 16? Plus Bless! No. Eight-- it is an 18
now, though!

01:20:36.479 --> 01:20:40.040
MATT: 18? It hits the helmet.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.304
LAURA: Oh no!

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:44.566
MATT: No damage. It just misses.

01:20:44.566 --> 01:20:46.565
MARISHA: It just misses.

01:20:47.115 --> 01:20:48.661
LIAM: We got another one coming.

01:20:48.662 --> 01:20:52.672
MARISHA: Okay. It just misses.

01:20:52.672 --> 01:20:54.398
MATT: That was your first attack.

01:20:54.579 --> 01:21:01.611
MARISHA: That was my first attack. That hits.
That's a natural 15 plus eight, so 23.

01:21:01.611 --> 01:21:07.027
MATT: This does hit. As you pull back the elbow,
you go for the chest hit after that. It does hit

01:21:07.027 --> 01:21:12.003
armor, but you find a piece where the plates
themselves meet. You push past, and you feel the

01:21:12.003 --> 01:21:14.188
impact catch him in the lower clavicle.

01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:16.695
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point to do
Stunning Strike.

01:21:16.975 --> 01:21:20.437
MATT: Okay. The DC on that is?

01:21:21.317 --> 01:21:23.482
MARISHA: It is 14.

01:21:23.482 --> 01:21:25.338
MATT: 18, unfortunately.

01:21:26.108 --> 01:21:27.944
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

01:21:27.944 --> 01:21:30.649
MARISHA: Oh wait, no. Not abilities, right?

01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:33.267
MATT: No. It doesn't affect the DC,
unfortunately.

01:21:33.517 --> 01:21:35.063
MARISHA: That's nine points of damage.

01:21:35.064 --> 01:21:36.612
MATT: Nine points of damage.

01:21:36.612 --> 01:21:42.204
MARISHA: I'm going to do Flurry of Blows. Another
ki point.

01:21:42.324 --> 01:21:44.436
MATT: Two more unarmed attacks. Go for it.

01:21:44.436 --> 01:21:52.221
MARISHA: Go down one. There we go. No. 18.

01:21:52.571 --> 01:21:54.038
MATT: 18 just misses. You go--

01:21:54.038 --> 01:21:56.056
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MARISHA: Bless!

01:21:56.056 --> 01:21:58.821
SAM: On every attack? Is that how it is? That's
amazing.

01:21:58.821 --> 01:22:00.107
MARISHA: Yes!

01:22:00.107 --> 01:22:09.449
MATT: 19, that's just enough. You pull back, and
Caduceus' guidance, the Wildmother's energy,

01:22:09.449 --> 01:22:11.228
propels you forward for that strike--

01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:12.104
TALIESIN: Hey.

01:22:12.104 --> 01:22:14.769
MATT: He's going to use his reaction to do Shadow
Martyr.

01:22:14.769 --> 01:22:17.052
MARISHA: I can also-- I've hit twice now, right?

01:22:17.052 --> 01:22:22.733
MATT: Well, this will be your second hit. It does
not. The clone that was in the space that you

01:22:22.734 --> 01:22:29.331
rushed into darts in between, and you end up
actually striking it in the chest instead. Roll

01:22:29.331 --> 01:22:32.855
damage on that strike. He doesn't take it, but the
clone does.

01:22:33.105 --> 01:22:34.375
MARISHA: Nine again.

01:22:36.345 --> 01:22:39.564
MATT: It dissipates, but it blocks the blow for
him.

01:22:39.564 --> 01:22:45.607
MARISHA: How many attacks do I need for my
Extract--?

01:22:46.137 --> 01:22:50.518
MATT: Extract Aspects? You need to hit him with
one of your Flurry of Blows strikes, which you

01:22:50.519 --> 01:22:52.724
haven't yet because it hit the clone instead.

01:22:53.164 --> 01:22:54.455
MARISHA: Okay, so one more.

01:22:54.455 --> 01:22:55.777
MATT: You get one more attack.

01:22:56.117 --> 01:22:57.494
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

01:22:57.724 --> 01:22:59.501
MATT: One, 13.

01:22:59.551 --> 01:23:01.766
MARISHA: Yeah, that hits. 21?

01:23:02.076 --> 01:23:05.402
MATT: Okay. Yeah, he does not have his reaction,
so it definitely hits.

01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:09.373
MARISHA: Six points of damage, but Extract
(stumbling)--

01:23:09.373 --> 01:23:12.567
MATT: Aspects, yes. What would you like to know?

01:23:13.328 --> 01:23:20.707
MARISHA: I want to know what his constitution
saving throw is.

01:23:20.707 --> 01:23:22.367
MATT: Plus four.

01:23:23.787 --> 01:23:24.937
LAURA: Whew.

01:23:24.937 --> 01:23:30.335
MARISHA: Okay, and then I get to know one more
thing, right? Do I get to know one thing or two things?

01:23:30.335 --> 01:23:33.113
MATT: No, we adjusted it so that every time you
hit, you get to learn one thing.

01:23:33.113 --> 01:23:35.741
MARISHA: Okay. Stunning Strike on that last one
again.

01:23:35.741 --> 01:23:36.753
MATT: Go for it.

01:23:36.883 --> 01:23:41.858
MARISHA: He rolls. Spending another ki point,
though. Stunning Strike.

01:23:41.859 --> 01:23:46.754
MATT: Right, Stunning Strike. No, he's stunned.

01:23:47.114 --> 01:23:50.888
TRAVIS: Come on! Who's up next? Hit that
motherfucker!

01:23:50.888 --> 01:23:52.719
MATT: I hate that ability so much.

01:23:53.479 --> 01:23:55.985
MARISHA: I burned three ki points, but I stunned
him!

01:23:56.335 --> 01:23:58.044
SAM: Oh my god, you're so clutch.

01:23:58.044 --> 01:24:01.317
MATT: That finishes your turn, Beau?
Caleb, you're up.

01:24:01.507 --> 01:24:06.964
LIAM: I cannot see anything. I'm going to move
around the edge to get a look at the battlefield.

01:24:07.605 --> 01:24:08.983
MATT: You scoot by.

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:12.113
TRAVIS: Tree's with you. Let go, Groot!

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:17.335
LIAM: I can probably see some gnoll archers from
there, and the man with the staff?

01:24:17.335 --> 01:24:18.055
MATT: Yes.

01:24:18.055 --> 01:24:25.007
LIAM: I will take a pinch of phosphorous, and slap
it into my hand, and squelch the other hand

01:24:25.007 --> 01:24:30.630
through it, and cast Wall of Fire, a straight line
splitting the field in half.

01:24:32.811 --> 01:24:34.277
TRAVIS: Woo! Dope.

01:24:34.277 --> 01:24:35.711
SAM: Where is this wall going?

01:24:35.711 --> 01:24:38.281
LIAM: Damage going this way, downstage.

01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:39.550
MATT: Across which way?

01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:45.678
LIAM: From Caleb, a straight line, blocking
Beauregard and her opponent. But it won't go that

01:24:45.678 --> 01:24:49.876
far. I'll probably start it where you put the
second one, Matthew.

01:24:50.066 --> 01:24:50.862
MATT: Oh, right.

01:24:50.863 --> 01:24:55.313
LIAM: Yeah. 60 feet, I believe.

01:24:56.123 --> 01:24:58.583
MATT: He's going to attempt to Counterspell.

01:24:58.813 --> 01:25:03.613
SAM: Oh wow! This is so sexy.

01:25:04.733 --> 01:25:08.402
MATT: Natural 16 plus five, 21. That fire wall--

01:25:08.402 --> 01:25:10.124
LIAM: Can I counter-Counterspell?

01:25:10.694 --> 01:25:11.597
MATT: Yes, you can.

01:25:11.597 --> 01:25:13.581
LIAM: At 4th-level? No, 3rd-level.

01:25:13.582 --> 01:25:17.872
MATT: Go ahead and roll. Well, no, it's a 3rd-level,
so it does cancel 3rd-level. Okay, I'll allow it.

01:25:17.872 --> 01:25:19.990
SAM and LAURA: Whoa.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:22.719
TALIESIN: It started a little further from you,
right?

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.480
LAURA: Yeah, he's starting it from that.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.732
MATT: Oh, from here?

01:25:27.733 --> 01:25:29.402
MARISHA: Fuck you! No, fuck you!

01:25:29.402 --> 01:25:30.563
MATT: Like this here?

01:25:30.563 --> 01:25:34.329
LIAM: Yeah. If I have any movement left, I will--

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.712
MATT: You have, I'll say, 15 feet of
movement left.

01:25:36.712 --> 01:25:38.385
LIAM: Go back where I came from.

01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:42.149
SAM: Classic Caleb.

01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:43.248
MATT: There you go.

01:25:43.248 --> 01:25:44.284
LIAM: You're welcome.

01:25:45.034 --> 01:25:45.898
SAM: Nice.

01:25:45.899 --> 01:25:47.641
MATT: That finishes your turn.

01:25:49.031 --> 01:25:50.805
TRAVIS: Caduceus, Fjord, Jester.

01:25:51.545 --> 01:25:58.544
MATT: Well, next it's the other figure that attempted
to Counterspell and failed. Angrily seeing you

01:25:58.544 --> 01:26:04.286
mid-spell Counterspell it while releasing this wall
of flame that shoots up in the space--

01:26:05.016 --> 01:26:07.776
TRAVIS: Who was Counterspelling? This individual
over here?

01:26:07.776 --> 01:26:08.705
LAURA: Yeah.

01:26:09.495 --> 01:26:12.640
MATT: He's going to go ahead and--

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.426
LAURA: (whispering) He's going to be able to do
something to all of us.

01:26:21.496 --> 01:26:26.067
MARISHA: I'm afraid of a Fireball or some shit.

01:26:26.067 --> 01:26:27.909
TALIESIN: We have cover right now, though.

01:26:27.909 --> 01:26:30.288
TRAVIS: What did we say about saying that
out loud?

01:26:30.288 --> 01:26:32.098
MARISHA: I'm sorry, it's like Macbeth.

01:26:32.098 --> 01:26:33.776
LIAM: Don't give the DM ideas.

01:26:33.776 --> 01:26:35.126
SAM: This is tense.

01:26:39.586 --> 01:26:42.831
LAURA: Matt, you look very dashing tonight. You
look really handsome.

01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:44.296
MATT: Thank you. You're sweet.

01:26:44.296 --> 01:26:46.034
MARISHA: Right? Isn't his beard so nice?

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:48.593
LAURA: It really is.

01:26:48.693 --> 01:26:53.003
LIAM: Yeah, what happened, Taliesin? Everyone had
a beard but me, so I jumped in, and now yours is gone.

01:26:53.003 --> 01:26:58.799
TALIESIN: I had to break the chain. Otherwise, if
there's too many beards, then it's free and

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:07.641
allowed to-- the creature that's beneath the table--
(whispering) Uk'otoa. Uk'otoa needs beards to survive.

01:27:11.081 --> 01:27:13.268
TRAVIS: He's got a lot of movement speed, man.

01:27:13.268 --> 01:27:15.767
MATT: Actually, it can hang back here, I think.

01:27:15.767 --> 01:27:16.947
SAM: Oh damn.

01:27:18.727 --> 01:27:25.588
MATT: It angrily watched the fire burn up. The
light scatters across the stone and base of the

01:27:25.588 --> 01:27:33.366
mountain here, the side of its armor now shining
from the flickering light source. Angrily it goes

01:27:33.366 --> 01:27:40.916
and hops up to the top after watching you dart
behind that area, raises its staff, focuses. In

01:27:40.916 --> 01:27:45.814
the center of the area out in front of Fjord, as
you're getting ready, Fjord, all of a sudden this

01:27:45.814 --> 01:27:54.073
green, thick fume fills the area as he casts
Cloudkill.

01:27:54.533 --> 01:27:56.405
LAURA and TRAVIS: Cloudkill?!

01:27:56.655 --> 01:27:59.179
LAURA: What even is that? How high of a level is
that?

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:00.804
MARISHA: I think that's real high.

01:28:00.804 --> 01:28:04.729
MATT: That hits all of you guys right there.
Everybody but Beau--

01:28:04.729 --> 01:28:06.726
LAURA: Oh my god, are we all going to die?

01:28:06.726 --> 01:28:07.545
SAM: Me, too?

01:28:07.796 --> 01:28:13.909
MATT: Yeah, because it had to hit at the edge of
the fire wall to try and get inside the alcove

01:28:13.909 --> 01:28:23.075
where it saw you vanish. It actually does overlap
where you are. Yeah, it does. I need everyone to

01:28:23.075 --> 01:28:25.079
make a constitution saving throw.

01:28:25.079 --> 01:28:26.137
TALIESIN: With a d4.

01:28:26.137 --> 01:28:27.755
LAURA: With Bless, except for me!

01:28:27.756 --> 01:28:29.279
TALIESIN: Except for you. Sorry.

01:28:29.279 --> 01:28:30.241
TRAVIS: Yasha first.

01:28:30.241 --> 01:28:32.351
SAM: Oh boy, not good.

01:28:32.351 --> 01:28:33.724
TALIESIN: With a d4?

01:28:34.555 --> 01:28:37.880
LAURA: Oh, balls.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.133
TALIESIN: Oh, not good.

01:28:39.133 --> 01:28:40.767
SAM: Oh boy.

01:28:42.257 --> 01:28:43.449
TRAVIS: Excellent.

01:28:43.449 --> 01:28:44.866
TALIESIN: No, that's not good.

01:28:44.867 --> 01:28:48.338
MARISHA: These are bad things! These are bad
things to be saying out loud.

01:28:48.338 --> 01:28:51.624
SAM: You're fine. You've got a book on your head.
You're fine.

01:28:51.624 --> 01:28:53.205
TALIESIN: That's really bad.

01:28:55.615 --> 01:28:57.635
SAM: Is that numbers, or is that a wave?

01:28:57.635 --> 01:28:59.368
LAURA: It's numbers.

01:29:02.308 --> 01:29:07.092
TRAVIS: Fjord rolled a 24. Yasha rolled a 19.

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:10.411
MATT: You both take 16 points of poison damage.

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:11.958
TRAVIS: Copy that.

01:29:11.958 --> 01:29:18.239
LIAM: War Caster feat at advantage. Proficiency
bonus, plus the Bless, I got to 16.

01:29:22.179 --> 01:29:23.917
MATT: Wait, War Caster to--

01:29:23.917 --> 01:29:30.303
LIAM: That's my feat. Oh, that's concentration.
Oh, so not at advantage at all. But the first roll

01:29:30.303 --> 01:29:32.303
was the highest, so the same.

01:29:32.303 --> 01:29:35.616
MATT: Okay. You also take 16 points of poison
damage.

01:29:35.616 --> 01:29:36.911
SAM: Fail. Nine.

01:29:36.911 --> 01:29:39.091
MATT: Take 32 points of poison damage.

01:29:39.851 --> 01:29:40.693
LAURA: 21.

01:29:40.694 --> 01:29:42.902
MATT: You take 16 points of poison damage.

01:29:43.002 --> 01:29:44.082
TALIESIN: Seven.

01:29:44.082 --> 01:29:49.325
MATT: You take 32 points of poison damage. The
cloud remains there.

01:29:49.845 --> 01:29:52.129
LAURA: Did you say-- how many points did I take?

01:29:52.939 --> 01:29:53.992
MATT: You took 16.

01:29:53.992 --> 01:29:54.974
LAURA: 16.

01:29:56.874 --> 01:30:00.922
SAM: Uncanny Dodge doesn't work against
area-of-effect sort of things?

01:30:00.922 --> 01:30:02.829
MATT: It's not an attack, unfortunately.

01:30:02.829 --> 01:30:03.668
SAM: Okay, cool.

01:30:07.878 --> 01:30:12.889
MATT: Yeah, and it's not a dexterity saving throw.
The cloud remains there. All of you all of a sudden

01:30:12.889 --> 01:30:17.655
feel the poisonous fume burning against your skin
and the inside of your lungs, and you find yourself

01:30:17.655 --> 01:30:23.643
instinctually coughing in horrible pain. It's burning
the inside of your body like an acidic rock

01:30:23.643 --> 01:30:25.298
that's expanding in your chest.

01:30:25.298 --> 01:30:27.440
LAURA: What level spell is that? Do we know?

01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:29.396
SAM: Ass-level.

01:30:29.396 --> 01:30:33.885
MATT: It's also going to use its Gravity Well
ability, which whenever it affects a creature

01:30:33.886 --> 01:30:38.705
with a spell, it can push it ten feet in a direction
of its choice. You guys feel, as you're coughing,

01:30:38.705 --> 01:30:41.736
the sudden force of gravity begin to drag you out
into the open.

01:30:41.986 --> 01:30:42.733
SAM: Cool.

01:30:42.734 --> 01:30:44.214
MATT: Ten feet for each of you.

01:30:44.214 --> 01:30:46.834
LIAM: Matt, also, do I need to make a constitution
save?

01:30:46.834 --> 01:30:49.740
MATT: You do, and everyone with Bless up has to
make one, too.

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:51.160
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:52.755
LAURA: Oh.

01:30:53.616 --> 01:30:54.900
MARISHA: Did you roll a 20?

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.616
LIAM: Yeah.

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:56.398
MARISHA: Good.

01:30:56.398 --> 01:30:58.871
TALIESIN: Do I get to use-- that's on a save, is it?

01:30:58.871 --> 01:31:00.726
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw.

01:31:00.726 --> 01:31:02.674
TALIESIN: So the Bless does add to the--?

01:31:02.674 --> 01:31:03.387
LAURA: 16.

01:31:03.387 --> 01:31:04.486
MATT: I think it would.

01:31:04.486 --> 01:31:05.238
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:31:05.238 --> 01:31:12.660
MATT: 16? Yeah. You need to roll, for most of you
guys who took 32 damage, you need to get 16 or higher.

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.058
LAURA: I only took 16 damage.

01:31:14.058 --> 01:31:15.157
MATT: Yes, you're fine.

01:31:15.157 --> 01:31:16.820
TALIESIN: It's a constitution save?

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:17.516
MATT: Yes.

01:31:17.516 --> 01:31:18.231
TALIESIN: 21.

01:31:18.231 --> 01:31:19.422
SAM: To maintain a spell?

01:31:19.422 --> 01:31:21.705
MATT: You rolled a 21? Yeah, so you maintain it.

01:31:21.706 --> 01:31:22.842
SAM: 17 plus others.

01:31:22.842 --> 01:31:25.174
MATT: Yeah, so you maintain your Invisibility.

01:31:25.254 --> 01:31:27.300
LIAM: Natural 20, that got me up to 26.

01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:35.717
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. All right, cool. That finishes
its go, and it's going to step back around there.

01:31:37.377 --> 01:31:42.792
Actually, it's going to use its last movement to
step down in that space. That ends its turn.

01:31:43.052 --> 01:31:45.169
That now brings us to Caduceus.

01:31:47.219 --> 01:31:56.004
TALIESIN: Do I take damage at the top of the round?
With the gas, or no? That would really suck, but I

01:31:56.004 --> 01:31:59.385
thought I'd ask, because I'm an idiot.

01:31:59.386 --> 01:32:04.897
MATT: If you start your turn there-- Actually, this
damage happens at the start of your turn, I misread

01:32:04.897 --> 01:32:09.950
that. So it didn't hit you yet. As your turns come
around, you will take this damage and be pulled out.

01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:11.996
TALIESIN: Okay, so I just took that damage.

01:32:11.997 --> 01:32:12.900
MATT: Correct.

01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:24.427
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast-- First thing I'm going
to do is-- motherfucker. Sorry, I'm a little thrown.

01:32:26.097 --> 01:32:34.782
I'm going to step out of this cloud up around that
way. Is that my full movement?

01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:36.398
MATT: You have five feet left.

01:32:40.518 --> 01:32:57.843
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- shit, son. I'm going to see if
I can get a little-- Oh fuck, then I'm going to be in

01:32:57.843 --> 01:33:07.398
the range of the archers. I'm going to pull around
the corner there and I'm going to burn my action

01:33:07.399 --> 01:33:11.777
to get-- Can I get within 30 feet of Beau's
opponent, or no?

01:33:11.777 --> 01:33:15.051
MATT: If you're using your action to run, maybe.
You don't know. You can try it.

01:33:16.511 --> 01:33:18.019
TALIESIN: I'll try it.

01:33:18.019 --> 01:33:30.420
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 25, 30. Gets you about there.
You are-- it is 35 feet from you.

01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:32.223
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast the--

01:33:32.223 --> 01:33:33.880
LAURA: He's 35 feet.

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:39.130
TALIESIN: 35's fine. I'm going to use the Blight Staff
and summon the swarm five feet away from him.

01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:40.111
MATT: All right.

01:33:42.331 --> 01:33:44.572
TALIESIN: Next turn, they can attack.

01:33:44.572 --> 01:33:45.361
MATT: Correct.

01:33:45.361 --> 01:33:47.126
TALIESIN: That's everything I can do.

01:33:47.126 --> 01:33:48.993
MATT: All right, ending Caduceus' turn.

01:33:48.993 --> 01:33:51.279
TALIESIN: I'm just going to keep my cover there.

01:33:51.279 --> 01:33:57.393
MATT: It is now the rest of the rangers out here's
turn. This one's going to dart around and take

01:33:57.393 --> 01:34:00.244
a longbow shot at the one with the staff.

01:34:02.194 --> 01:34:08.341
Nope, natural four. This one here is
going to go (counting) six and

01:34:08.341 --> 01:34:12.698
is going to take two attacks, with advantage,
on the stunned--

01:34:12.702 --> 01:34:17.792
TALIESIN: Technically, I can attack adjacent creatures,
so technically, I could have taken that bite attack.

01:34:17.792 --> 01:34:19.131
MATT: Okay, then go for it.

01:34:19.131 --> 01:34:20.652
TALIESIN: I'll add that to the--

01:34:20.652 --> 01:34:23.203
MATT: With advantage, that is 16 plus six.
That hits.

01:34:24.363 --> 01:34:26.887
TALIESIN: Where is that attack?

01:34:27.509 --> 01:34:29.276
MATT: So that's four damage it takes.

01:34:29.276 --> 01:34:30.630
TALIESIN: It's a melee attack.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:33.019
MATT: Second attack is a natural 20. That's a
crit.

01:34:33.019 --> 01:34:35.575
TALIESIN: Natural 20, by the way, to hit.

01:34:35.575 --> 01:34:39.499
MATT: Two natural 20s back-to-back, nice.
That's 11 points of damage from that one.

01:34:39.499 --> 01:34:43.913
TRAVIS: We need all the help we can get. We need&lt;i&gt;
all&lt;/i&gt; of that.

01:34:44.249 --> 01:34:48.172
MATT: You see the dragonborn, bleeding, cloak
pulled over one shoulder, come by and, with

01:34:48.172 --> 01:34:53.129
its longsword, hack twice into the entity and give
you a look of, "Let's do this."

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.456
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:34:54.947 --> 01:34:59.558
TALIESIN: Hit is ten 4d4 piercing damage, so is that
ten plus 4d4, if I recall, or is it just 4d4?

01:34:59.558 --> 01:35:00.701
MATT: No, it's just 4d4.

01:35:00.701 --> 01:35:03.321
TALIESIN: Why does it have that ten there? That's
weird.

01:35:03.321 --> 01:35:07.700
MATT: The plus ten is to hit, I think. Wait,
sorry, what you're seeing is the ten? Ten is the

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.220
average damage. I misheard you.

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:15.081
TALIESIN: That's (counting) 22 points of damage.

01:35:15.081 --> 01:35:17.521
MATT: 22 points of damage, ooh! Nice.

01:35:17.521 --> 01:35:21.156
LAURA: Sam is reminding me that I need to roll
constitution saves--

01:35:21.156 --> 01:35:22.574
MATT: For keeping Bless?

01:35:22.574 --> 01:35:29.325
LAURA: No, I did that already. For Nugget and
Sprinkle. I feel like Sprinkle is--

01:35:29.325 --> 01:35:32.005
SAM: I just hate animals so much.

01:35:32.006 --> 01:35:33.125
MATT: Apparently.

01:35:33.125 --> 01:35:36.400
LAURA: I feel like Sprinkle is in my clothes, so
he's got a filter.

01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:49.928
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of fun--
(laughter) I'm not going to immediately murder

01:35:49.928 --> 01:35:51.949
her weasel because of one errant spell.

01:35:51.949 --> 01:35:53.985
TRAVIS: Yeah, you piece of shit.

01:35:53.985 --> 01:35:55.847
SAM: That's not how I would have ruled.

01:35:55.857 --> 01:35:59.019
(laughter)

01:35:59.021 --> 01:36:02.333
MATT: Roll a constitution saving throw for
Nugget.

01:36:04.935 --> 01:36:05.766
LAURA: 18?

01:36:07.246 --> 01:36:11.480
MATT: Nice. For the hell of it--

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:14.736
TRAVIS: Terrible.

01:36:16.386 --> 01:36:21.504
MATT: Mark down that Nugget has eight hit points
left.

01:36:21.511 --> 01:36:30.285
LAURA: Yes. I have the thing, yeah. He took 16
points. He technically has six hit points left,

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:32.713
according to the thing that Sam gave me.

01:36:32.713 --> 01:36:37.688
MATT: Both of those guys are going to fire at the
stunned guy with advantage. Unfortunately, it

01:36:37.688 --> 01:36:42.585
still misses. It's the armor. They're hitting, but
the arrows are splintering across the armor.

01:36:42.585 --> 01:36:48.896
Second attack, four, and a natural 20! Nice!
They're actually doing decent, thanks to the stun.

01:36:48.896 --> 01:37:01.164
That's another 12 points of damage against him.
That finishes them. Kaulden's going to turn and

01:37:01.164 --> 01:37:09.798
pull out his shortbow and take a shot at that
gnoll over there. Fucking five, misses. Hits on

01:37:09.798 --> 01:37:11.233
the second one.

01:37:11.233 --> 01:37:12.689
TRAVIS: Come on, Calder!

01:37:13.289 --> 01:37:17.458
MATT: It damages that gnoll over there.
(whimpering and growling)

01:37:17.458 --> 01:37:19.035
LAURA: Yeah, Colder, Calder?

01:37:19.035 --> 01:37:27.637
MATT: Kaulden. He's going to step back and go this
way, staying out of the cloud area. This guy's

01:37:27.637 --> 01:37:33.727
going to move out from underneath the cloud,
coughing. Actually, at the start of his turn, he

01:37:33.727 --> 01:37:36.179
takes-- he does not make his save. He dies.

01:37:37.369 --> 01:37:38.616
TRAVIS: He dies?!

01:37:38.616 --> 01:37:45.985
MATT: He's coughing, vomits onto the ground, and
then collapses. You see the skin on the face begin

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:50.750
to bubble and boil from this strangely poisonous
cloud.

01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:53.781
MARISHA: Kaulden's losing all his people.

01:37:54.032 --> 01:37:57.023
MATT: Yeah, he only has four left, aside from
him.

01:37:57.093 --> 01:37:58.615
TALIESIN: They seemed so badass.

01:37:58.615 --> 01:38:01.235
MARISHA: They did! I thought they were going to
kill us.

01:38:01.235 --> 01:38:08.126
TALIESIN: I felt like they had their shit together.
They just had nice cloaks. We made some

01:38:08.127 --> 01:38:10.934
assumptions because you're like, oh, those cloaks
are great.

01:38:10.934 --> 01:38:13.936
TRAVIS: They whistled. They had a group whistle.
(cooing noises)

01:38:13.936 --> 01:38:16.129
MARISHA: Is that the secret?

01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:17.349
TALIESIN: Obviously not!

01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:19.847
LIAM: Fashion doth make the man.

01:38:21.477 --> 01:38:22.197
MATT: So.

01:38:23.947 --> 01:38:28.931
These NPCs are pretty strong for a general
ranger. Unfortunately, a lot of them got lined up

01:38:28.931 --> 01:38:36.806
with a certain spell that did a lot of damage.
After their turn, it is now Fjord's turn.

01:38:36.941 --> 01:38:40.766
TRAVIS: Yes. I will dart out of the green cloud--

01:38:40.766 --> 01:38:44.200
MATT: You take your damage at the top of the turn,
which you already did.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:51.018
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. I will move 30 feet towards Kaulden's
direction. Not up on the platform with him though.

01:38:51.018 --> 01:38:55.302
MATT: He's not up on the platform; he ducked down
below. You're actually right up next to--

01:38:55.302 --> 01:38:57.634
TRAVIS: Is that only as far as 30 feet carries
me?

01:38:57.634 --> 01:39:03.983
MATT: That's (counting) 20. You have ten more feet
if you want to go.

01:39:03.983 --> 01:39:09.454
TRAVIS: I will go-- can I get behind that spire or
that little upcropping?

01:39:09.584 --> 01:39:11.634
MATT: Yeah. You can get over there.

01:39:11.634 --> 01:39:19.820
TRAVIS: Perfect. I will use my action to point up
towards the sky; my eyes will roll back, and I

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:23.021
will summon the barlgura. And I will drop--

01:39:23.021 --> 01:39:23.986
MATT: Oh, shit!

01:39:23.986 --> 01:39:26.431
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yes!

01:39:26.431 --> 01:39:27.486
TALIESIN: Thank god!

01:39:28.834 --> 01:39:33.313
TRAVIS: 60 feet. As far as I can get it in the
direction of all these jackasses over here.

01:39:33.313 --> 01:39:39.021
MATT: 60 feet? Right there.

01:39:39.992 --> 01:39:41.613
TALIESIN: Just down the line, man.

01:39:41.613 --> 01:39:46.313
TRAVIS: I'll tell him to kill everything, but get
me the caster.

01:39:46.884 --> 01:39:47.777
MATT: Okay.

01:39:49.295 --> 01:39:51.293
MARISHA: He's not going to kill us, is he?

01:39:51.293 --> 01:39:53.956
MATT: Does the barlgura take its turn when you
summon it?

01:39:53.957 --> 01:39:55.288
TRAVIS: He rolls initiative.

01:39:55.288 --> 01:39:56.674
MATT: Right, so roll for him.

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:02.580
LAURA: Roll low so that he gets to go.

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:06.038
TRAVIS: Well, it's 15. He should've rolled
shittier.

01:40:07.548 --> 01:40:10.565
MATT: He's right before you guys next round.

01:40:10.565 --> 01:40:14.019
TRAVIS: Yeah, right before me. Damn it.

01:40:15.118 --> 01:40:16.770
MATT: That finish your turn?

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.488
TALIESIN: Unless you have a B.A.

01:40:21.838 --> 01:40:23.226
MARISHA: B.A.

01:40:24.004 --> 01:40:25.381
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's it.

01:40:25.381 --> 01:40:26.527
MATT: Jester, you're up.

01:40:26.527 --> 01:40:40.113
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. I'm going to look at how
this works, and probably-- I mean, I can try this.

01:40:40.113 --> 01:40:42.173
SAM: Yeah. Try whatever.

01:40:43.413 --> 01:40:54.960
LAURA: I don't know how long that lasts. Okay, I'm going
to (squeal). Okay, I'm going to run out from

01:40:54.961 --> 01:41:04.957
under the cloud. Can I climb up and over and hop
down right here?

01:41:04.957 --> 01:41:09.635
MATT: Sure, make an athletics-- or it'll cost you
ten feet of movement. It's not too terribly high.

01:41:09.635 --> 01:41:10.875
Five, 10 15.

01:41:11.595 --> 01:41:16.028
LAURA: I want to hop down behind that rock, on the
other side.

01:41:16.028 --> 01:41:20.801
MATT: (counting) That's your movement, getting you
there. You can jump down this way, or you can jump

01:41:20.801 --> 01:41:23.848
down-- you can't quite get far enough to jump over
that way.

01:41:23.848 --> 01:41:26.747
LAURA: I guess I'll jump down on that side.

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:29.252
LIAM: Can we see in the cloud, by the way?

01:41:31.162 --> 01:41:39.267
MATT: I would say you can barely make out shapes
and stuff. I'll say half cover while inside. You

01:41:39.267 --> 01:41:43.922
can still see shapes and things at a
certain distance.

01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:45.974
LAURA: I'm out of the cloud?

01:41:45.974 --> 01:41:47.665
MATT: You're out of the cloud, yes.

01:41:47.665 --> 01:41:55.813
LAURA: Then I'm going to use my action to Invoke
Duplicity. She's going to appear on the backside

01:41:55.813 --> 01:42:09.838
of the mean guy that's stunned. Yes, that guy.
Then for my bonus action, I'm going to-- I guess I

01:42:09.838 --> 01:42:15.094
can't cast another thing. I'm going to--

01:42:16.528 --> 01:42:19.287
TALIESIN: Do you have a bonus action heal that
you can hit?

01:42:19.287 --> 01:42:22.877
LAURA: I don't think so. Mm-mm, because I
already-- hmm.

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:31.114
TALIESIN: Healing Word's a B.A. Why am I saying
B.A. all the time?

01:42:31.114 --> 01:42:32.072
LAURA: I don't know.

01:42:32.073 --> 01:42:33.250
SAM: Oh, fuck!

01:42:34.104 --> 01:42:39.807
LAURA: I don't have Healing Word. I'm going to
crouch down.

01:42:40.347 --> 01:42:45.050
MATT: You get low and put your back against the
wall. That finishes Jester's turn. Now the gnolls'

01:42:45.051 --> 01:42:52.777
go. These gnolls here immediately rush forward,
drawing their weapons to strike at whatever this

01:42:52.777 --> 01:43:01.057
terrible thing that rose up is. Both of them are
going to make a spear attack against it.

01:43:01.057 --> 01:43:03.675
Natural 20, the first one against it.

01:43:04.866 --> 01:43:06.066
TRAVIS: I think it hits.

01:43:08.116 --> 01:43:14.074
MATT: And an eight. That's 17 points of damage
from one gnoll's spear. The other one against it,

01:43:14.074 --> 01:43:14.929
natural two.

01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:16.115
TRAVIS: That misses.

01:43:16.195 --> 01:43:20.380
MATT: The other one, the barlgura grabs the spear
and is now wrestling for it. (growling) Spittle

01:43:20.381 --> 01:43:25.652
coming out of it. The gnolls are taken aback by
it. They still feel their power in numbers, so

01:43:25.652 --> 01:43:28.276
they're not quite certain of the danger they're
in.

01:43:28.896 --> 01:43:30.281
TALIESIN: We'll work on that.

01:43:32.063 --> 01:43:42.699
MATT: This guy moves up a bit and comes to this
point. He's going to fire a longbow at you, Travis.

01:43:42.699 --> 01:43:44.870
TRAVIS: Fjord or the barlgura? Or Yasha?

01:43:44.871 --> 01:43:50.844
MATT: Fjord. No, at Travis, at you. That is a 25
to hit, actually.

01:43:51.304 --> 01:43:52.454
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:43:56.825 --> 01:44:05.679
MATT: That is nine points of piercing damage as
the longbow arrow sinks into your chest. Make a

01:44:05.679 --> 01:44:08.500
constitution saving throw for me, to try and
maintain--

01:44:10.747 --> 01:44:12.604
TALIESIN: You get to add a d4 to that.

01:44:12.604 --> 01:44:13.650
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

01:44:13.650 --> 01:44:14.867
MARISHA: Hashtag blessed.

01:44:15.828 --> 01:44:16.981
TRAVIS: 21.

01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:21.009
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You maintain that. This
one's going to move forward.

01:44:21.009 --> 01:44:23.094
SAM: That's a gnoll? A regular gnoll?

01:44:23.114 --> 01:44:27.212
MATT: Regular gnoll, yeah. It's going to take a
shot at this guy over here.

01:44:29.113 --> 01:44:30.673
Natural 20 again!

01:44:30.673 --> 01:44:31.467
TALIESIN: Jesus.

01:44:32.519 --> 01:44:33.978
TRAVIS: Happy Valentine's Day!

01:44:34.889 --> 01:44:36.703
TALIESIN: Archers. Oh, I get it now.

01:44:36.713 --> 01:44:41.242
MATT: The arrow sinks in. It doesn't kill that
ranger, but that ranger is now looking around and

01:44:41.242 --> 01:44:46.428
seeing a lot of his friends dead and is starting
to gauge if it's worth staying. That finishes that

01:44:46.428 --> 01:44:55.469
gnoll there. This one here, let's see if it's
going to mess with the barlgura. Yeah, it's going

01:44:55.469 --> 01:45:03.958
to rush up and join its friends, to try and group
up on the barlgura. That is a 15 to hit. What's

01:45:03.958 --> 01:45:05.067
its armor class?

01:45:05.068 --> 01:45:06.034
TRAVIS: It's 15.

01:45:06.034 --> 01:45:14.460
MATT: Okay. It takes ten points of piercing damage.
Using both hands, it jams the spear into its abdomen.

01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:16.736
TALIESIN: Wow, they're really going on him.

01:45:16.736 --> 01:45:19.991
MATT: That ends the gnolls' go. That brings us to
Nott.

01:45:20.571 --> 01:45:24.686
SAM: If I run out of the cloud, do I take more
damage, or is that--?

01:45:24.686 --> 01:45:30.168
MATT: No, at the top of the turn is when you take
the damage. I'm retroactively considering that. If

01:45:30.168 --> 01:45:31.378
you stay in the cloud--

01:45:31.568 --> 01:45:42.100
SAM: I'm going to run out of the cloud. I think
I'll go downstage, so I'll run towards this mess

01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:46.652
over here. Can I get as far as this, or no?

01:45:46.652 --> 01:45:48.743
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30 is where you can get.

01:45:48.743 --> 01:45:50.242
SAM: 35 feet of movement.

01:45:50.242 --> 01:45:51.780
MATT: Okay, right there.

01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:52.750
LIAM: Fjord's dead.

01:45:52.901 --> 01:45:57.602
MATT: Bye, Fjord. Sorry, bud. That's as far as you
can get there.

01:46:00.972 --> 01:46:09.291
SAM: Well, then, I will... balls. (singing) Balls,
balls, balls.

01:46:09.292 --> 01:46:10.956
TALIESIN: You've got a gnoll there.

01:46:10.956 --> 01:46:19.891
SAM: We do have lots of gnolls that I don't want
to waste my effort on. I will bonus action get

01:46:19.891 --> 01:46:21.735
behind that tree stump thing there.

01:46:21.735 --> 01:46:23.922
MATT: Okay, so you're going to dash behind it?

01:46:23.922 --> 01:46:33.472
SAM: Yeah. Then I'm poking out, and I will hold
my action until I see the caster.

01:46:34.282 --> 01:46:35.812
I will hold a crossbow bolt.

01:46:35.812 --> 01:46:40.038
MATT: Okay, you got it. That ends Nott's go.
Yasha's up.

01:46:40.748 --> 01:46:42.602
TRAVIS: Yasha would like to ragÃ©.

01:46:43.774 --> 01:46:45.426
MATT: She has effectively ragÃ©d.

01:46:45.426 --> 01:46:54.865
TRAVIS: Okay, and she will make her way towards
Beau, 40 feet.

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:58.553
MATT: (counting) 40.

01:46:58.615 --> 01:47:08.587
TRAVIS: Yep. Does the Kryn have any illusions or
duplicates or copies up or anything?

01:47:08.587 --> 01:47:09.361
MATT: Currently, no.

01:47:09.361 --> 01:47:18.586
TRAVIS: Nothing? Then she's going to throw the
Magician's Judge at the Kryn.

01:47:19.246 --> 01:47:21.377
SAM: Okay. Is that a thing?

01:47:21.377 --> 01:47:26.846
MATT: It's an improvised weapon, technically,
because you're throwing it. Roll an attack roll.

01:47:27.596 --> 01:47:28.779
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

01:47:28.779 --> 01:47:35.420
TRAVIS: Okay. She will make it reckless. Sorry,
again, I'm rolling a what plus a what?

01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:38.133
MATT: You're rolling 2d20 plus 1d4.

01:47:38.293 --> 01:47:45.393
TRAVIS: Okay, so 19 plus 1d4. Natural 19 plus two,
21.

01:47:45.603 --> 01:47:47.334
MATT: 21 plus her strength modifier.

01:47:47.334 --> 01:47:50.130
TRAVIS: Which is (stammering) three.

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:55.884
MATT: You hit. You're fine. Roll a d4 plus her
strength, plus rage bonus. It's not full sword

01:47:55.884 --> 01:47:58.073
damage; she's just (whooshing).

01:47:58.073 --> 01:47:59.597
TRAVIS: Sorry, again, d4 plus--?

01:47:59.597 --> 01:48:01.405
MATT: Plus strength, plus rage damage.

01:48:01.405 --> 01:48:04.159
TRAVIS: (counting) Nine points.

01:48:04.159 --> 01:48:10.186
MATT: Nine points of damage. While the Kryn's
shaking its head trying to right itself, the

01:48:10.186 --> 01:48:15.213
Magician's Judge (whooshing, then impact), scrapes
off the armor and carves in for a minute. It

01:48:15.213 --> 01:48:20.733
sticks for a second before it falls out, leaving
this open wound where some of the armor's opening

01:48:20.734 --> 01:48:23.950
against the plates. That ends Yasha's go?

01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:29.661
TRAVIS: I believe so. The Divine Fury, would that
apply to that weapon attack? When you're raging,

01:48:29.661 --> 01:48:33.656
the first creature you hit on one of your turns
with a weapon attack. 1d6 plus three.

01:48:33.656 --> 01:48:35.174
MATT: Yeah, I'll allow it.

01:48:35.174 --> 01:48:39.202
TRAVIS: Okay, 1d6 plus three. Six plus three, so
nine radiant damage.

01:48:39.202 --> 01:48:49.901
MATT: Nice! Not too bad. I'll take that. Okay,
that ends your go. It's now the Kryn's turn.

01:48:49.901 --> 01:48:51.897
It's stunned; can't do anything.

01:48:51.897 --> 01:48:54.562
MARISHA: (chuckling maniacally)

01:48:54.562 --> 01:48:56.491
MATT: Beau, your go.

01:48:56.491 --> 01:48:59.898
MARISHA: (grunts) Same thing, up under that
helmet!

01:48:59.898 --> 01:49:02.279
TRAVIS: Do you have advantage because he's
stunned?

01:49:02.279 --> 01:49:04.420
MARISHA: Fuck you and your helmet. Yes, I do.

01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:05.991
TRAVIS: Fuck you and your helmet.

01:49:05.991 --> 01:49:07.190
TALIESIN: Your d4.

01:49:07.190 --> 01:49:14.678
MARISHA: (laughter) The power! Fuck. Wait! No.

01:49:14.678 --> 01:49:16.942
TRAVIS: You're kidding. Which ones? These two?

01:49:16.942 --> 01:49:21.220
MARISHA: No, I rolled an eight and a three, and
then I rolled a one with my-- no. It's 17.

01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:26.314
MATT: You get excited and punch right square into
the chest part of the armor. You feel your

01:49:26.314 --> 01:49:29.882
knuckles (cracking), and it stings, and it didn't
quite get through.

01:49:29.882 --> 01:49:35.150
MARISHA: Thanks for the wraps. I'm going to knee
him in the balls.

01:49:35.150 --> 01:49:37.150
MATT: Go for it. Roll for a second attack.

01:49:37.150 --> 01:49:38.389
MARISHA: That feels right.

01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:40.148
SAM: Happy Valentine's Day.

01:49:41.159 --> 01:49:42.679
MARISHA: Son of a fuck bitch!

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.060
MATT: You have advantage still. He's still
stunned.

01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.059
MARISHA: I did! A three and a four!

01:49:46.059 --> 01:49:47.240
MATT: Oh, shit.

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:50.320
TALIESIN: Plus the d4, even? Yeah, that doesn't
matter.

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:56.929
MATT: You go for the balls. You've learned a
little bit about the Kryn Dynasty's main armored

01:49:56.929 --> 01:49:58.693
warriors: they wear a metal cup.

01:49:58.693 --> 01:49:59.909
LIAM: Carapace codpiece.

01:49:59.909 --> 01:50:01.771
MATT: (metallic clang) "Ugh!"

01:50:01.771 --> 01:50:03.241
LAURA: It's smart.

01:50:03.241 --> 01:50:06.017
SAM and TRAVIS: Yeah, you've got to protect that.

01:50:06.017 --> 01:50:07.200
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.817
MATT: All right, two more strikes.

01:50:08.817 --> 01:50:10.118
MARISHA: Two more strikes.

01:50:10.118 --> 01:50:11.708
LIAM: Woman wants a hit.

01:50:13.038 --> 01:50:22.803
MARISHA: I can't believe-- he's fucking stunned!
Yes! Yes. This one does. Plus four--

01:50:22.804 --> 01:50:24.895
LIAM: 14, with your modifier.

01:50:24.895 --> 01:50:26.776
MARISHA: 18 plus four: 22.

01:50:26.776 --> 01:50:28.326
MATT: 22 hits!

01:50:28.326 --> 01:50:34.231
MARISHA: That was the first one. Okay. Ten damage,
Stunning Strike.

01:50:34.231 --> 01:50:35.976
MATT: Stunning Strike again.

01:50:35.976 --> 01:50:38.228
MARISHA: Again. I am burning all my ki points.

01:50:38.228 --> 01:50:42.063
MATT: That is a 17, with a plus four bonus.
13 plus four.

01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:44.849
SAM: Is that good? Is that bad?

01:50:44.850 --> 01:50:45.870
MATT: He resists it.

01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:46.861
SAM: He resisted?!

01:50:46.861 --> 01:50:50.296
MARISHA: He resisted. One more time!

01:50:50.686 --> 01:50:51.695
LIAM: Two threes.

01:50:51.695 --> 01:50:54.458
TALIESIN: What are you rolling? Do you need to
borrow dice?

01:50:54.458 --> 01:50:57.170
LAURA: Yeah, get rid of those dice, maybe?
Don't use them?

01:50:57.170 --> 01:51:00.068
SAM: Maybe it doesn't matter because that's just
superstition?

01:51:00.068 --> 01:51:01.215
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;It matters!&lt;/i&gt;

01:51:01.215 --> 01:51:02.452
MATT: I'm so sorry.

01:51:02.452 --> 01:51:04.932
TALIESIN: Got to clean your palate.

01:51:05.372 --> 01:51:07.248
MARISHA: Running low on ki points.

01:51:07.248 --> 01:51:11.432
MATT: However, you did hit, so you get to learn
something else about him, if you want to.

01:51:11.432 --> 01:51:21.673
MARISHA: I did hit. I hit the one time. Does
anyone have any spells that you do?

01:51:21.673 --> 01:51:24.213
LAURA: Yeah, find out what his wisdom is.

01:51:24.213 --> 01:51:26.688
MARISHA: His wisdom. What is his wisdom
saving throw?

01:51:26.688 --> 01:51:27.839
MATT: Plus one.

01:51:27.839 --> 01:51:31.018
MARISHA: Plus one? His constitution was plus
four.

01:51:31.018 --> 01:51:32.590
TRAVIS: Aha! That's what it was.

01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:36.307
MARISHA: His wisdom is plus one. So he's not very
wise!

01:51:36.307 --> 01:51:41.219
MATT: Beau, are you staying where you are? Are you
going to move anywhere, or are you going to stay put?

01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:45.355
MARISHA: I'll stay. Well, he's about to be
unstunned.

01:51:45.355 --> 01:51:46.264
MATT: He is.

01:51:46.765 --> 01:51:59.054
MARISHA: I'm going to back up in between Yasha and
Caduceus, upstage.

01:51:59.714 --> 01:52:00.712
MATT: There?

01:52:00.712 --> 01:52:03.274
MARISHA: Upstage. Yeah.

01:52:03.274 --> 01:52:05.706
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go.
Caleb, you're up.

01:52:05.706 --> 01:52:10.661
LIAM: I'm going to run out of this cloud directly
downstage, which I think will put us next to our

01:52:10.661 --> 01:52:11.524
new friend?

01:52:13.294 --> 01:52:14.257
MATT: Right there?

01:52:14.257 --> 01:52:21.682
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;. From there I can see Fjord's pet, and
I can see this gnoll peeking out, so I will slap

01:52:21.682 --> 01:52:28.911
the guano and the sulfur together and throw a
Fireball to ignite right here to get these guys

01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:32.991
and as a bonus, this asshole that I can't see.

01:52:33.931 --> 01:52:35.572
LAURA: But you saw him pop down.

01:52:35.573 --> 01:52:37.986
MATT: Okay. Roll damage for that.

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:46.471
TRAVIS: (singing) Barlgura has fire resistance.

01:52:46.471 --> 01:52:48.092
MATT: Still make its saving throw.

01:52:48.092 --> 01:52:49.195
LIAM: 25.

01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:50.577
TALIESIN: Balrog's not in it.

01:52:50.768 --> 01:52:52.263
LAURA: He's just outside of it.

01:52:52.773 --> 01:52:56.012
MATT: Sure, I'll allow it.

01:52:56.762 --> 01:52:59.500
TRAVIS: If he's in it, he's in it. I thought
he was in it.

01:52:59.731 --> 01:53:04.491
MATT: There is a way that you can-- Roll a
standard intelligence check for me.

01:53:04.491 --> 01:53:06.767
LIAM: Okay. I mean--

01:53:08.557 --> 01:53:10.322
MATT: It's not a huge deal.

01:53:11.332 --> 01:53:16.062
LIAM: That is-- straight intelligence you said,
right? 15.

01:53:16.062 --> 01:53:20.099
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Keep the barlgura, no
worries. Damage on that was--?

01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:21.038
LIAM: 25.

01:53:23.538 --> 01:53:29.728
MATT: For the gnolls here, dex save. 15, what's
the spell DC?

01:53:31.489 --> 01:53:34.499
LIAM: For Fireball?

01:53:34.499 --> 01:53:36.106
MATT: For any of your spells.

01:53:36.106 --> 01:53:36.911
LIAM: Oh, 16.

01:53:37.132 --> 01:53:38.693
MATT: All right, that's a fail.

01:53:39.034 --> 01:53:42.058
TALIESIN and SAM: Yes!

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:46.201
MATT: Fail. Fail.

01:53:46.411 --> 01:53:47.376
TRAVIS: What?

01:53:48.166 --> 01:53:49.231
MATT: Success.

01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:58.556
MATT: All those gnolls just (yelp) and are
immediately burned to a crisp and fall back,

01:53:58.556 --> 01:54:04.999
smoking. For the Kryn mage there, natural 19--

01:54:04.999 --> 01:54:05.739
LIAM: Dick.

01:54:05.739 --> 01:54:08.030
MATT: So he only takes half the damage of that.

01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:10.742
TRAVIS: Bless you, Caleb, you sweet son of a
bitch.

01:54:10.742 --> 01:54:16.070
LAURA: (southern accent) I hope he's a glass
cannon as well. Maybe he's also really low on health.

01:54:16.450 --> 01:54:18.615
MATT: All right. That ends your go?

01:54:18.615 --> 01:54:19.483
LIAM: I'm out.

01:54:19.483 --> 01:54:25.612
MATT: You got it. He's going to make a
concentration check-- that's cocked. And fails;

01:54:25.612 --> 01:54:27.517
the Cloudkill vanishes.

01:54:27.517 --> 01:54:28.670
TRAVIS: Fucking amazing.

01:54:28.670 --> 01:54:30.382
LAURA: Now that we're all out of it.

01:54:30.392 --> 01:54:31.394
TRAVIS: Yep (laughs).

01:54:31.395 --> 01:54:32.301
MATT: I mean, yeah.

01:54:32.301 --> 01:54:33.786
LIAM: He flushed us out.

01:54:37.066 --> 01:54:43.620
MATT: It is now that figure's turn. Couple of
fun things:

01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:45.528
TRAVIS: Couple of fun things!

01:54:45.528 --> 01:54:46.911
TALIESIN: I hate that phrase.

01:54:46.911 --> 01:54:48.622
TRAVIS: This is not a lair, Matthew.

01:54:48.622 --> 01:54:52.611
LAURA: Unless we're saying it, it's not a good
phrase! Anybody want some chocolate?!

01:54:53.711 --> 01:54:54.455
LIAM: Yes.

01:54:58.781 --> 01:55:06.045
MATT: From behind this area here a shadow version
of that same mage comes out of hiding, and they

01:55:06.045 --> 01:55:08.732
both, in the same turn, moves forward to
here.

01:55:08.732 --> 01:55:10.863
TRAVIS: Comes &lt;i&gt;out&lt;/i&gt; of hiding, he's been there?

01:55:10.863 --> 01:55:12.292
MARISHA: Yeah, the whole time?

01:55:12.292 --> 01:55:13.003
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:55:13.003 --> 01:55:13.732
SAM: Fire.

01:55:13.732 --> 01:55:15.308
MATT: Didn't go on the last turn.

01:55:15.308 --> 01:55:19.019
LAURA: It's like they have a best friend
with them all the time, they're like--

01:55:19.019 --> 01:55:22.498
TRAVIS: The mage took damage on the Firebolt
that Caleb did though, right?

01:55:22.498 --> 01:55:23.169
MATT: Correct.

01:55:23.170 --> 01:55:24.320
SAM: I am firing at him.

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.036
MATT: You are.

01:55:25.036 --> 01:55:26.429
SAM: (whispering) Fuck.

01:55:26.429 --> 01:55:27.385
TALIESIN: Plus four!

01:55:27.385 --> 01:55:33.299
SAM: Yeah I got it. Not great. Oh, well, 18.

01:55:33.299 --> 01:55:34.100
MATT: 18 hits.

01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:35.572
SAM: Okay, good.

01:55:35.572 --> 01:55:39.041
MATT: But you are no longer invisible either.

01:55:39.041 --> 01:55:40.812
SAM: That's right. Ah!

01:55:40.812 --> 01:55:41.556
LAURA: Ah!

01:55:41.556 --> 01:55:48.656
SAM: Ah! Fury of the Small.

01:55:50.557 --> 01:55:53.357
LIAM: That's my secret: I'm always small.

01:55:54.878 --> 01:55:55.696
SAM: 22!

01:55:56.786 --> 01:55:57.885
MATT: Okay, 22.

01:55:57.885 --> 01:55:58.946
SAM: Points of damage.

01:55:58.946 --> 01:56:04.342
MATT: Nice. Okay, actually, this guy-- no, he's
going to stay there.

01:56:05.282 --> 01:56:07.666
TRAVIS: You were firing at the shadow, or the guy?

01:56:07.666 --> 01:56:08.553
SAM: The real one.

01:56:08.553 --> 01:56:09.559
LAURA: Real guy.

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:10.797
TALIESIN: Guy on the hill.

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:11.500
MATT: Correct.

01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:12.643
TRAVIS: Real Slim Shady.

01:56:12.643 --> 01:56:23.294
MATT: All right. Great. So you finish that
strike, this one moves out of the way here, and

01:56:23.294 --> 01:56:26.635
he's going to cast Compress Gravity at 3rd-level.

01:56:27.555 --> 01:56:30.154
LAURA: The little shadow guy can cast spells?

01:56:30.154 --> 01:56:31.682
MATT: He can cast one spell.

01:56:31.862 --> 01:56:33.436
SAM: What is it, Reverse Gravity?

01:56:33.436 --> 01:56:35.007
MATT and LAURA: Compress Gravity.

01:56:35.007 --> 01:56:35.897
SAM: What is that?

01:56:35.898 --> 01:56:37.375
LAURA: That's what we just saw.

01:56:37.375 --> 01:56:42.956
MATT: I need Caleb and Fjord to both make a
constitution saving throw, please.

01:56:42.956 --> 01:56:44.449
LAURA: You can do it.

01:56:44.449 --> 01:56:45.505
TALIESIN: Plus the d4.

01:56:45.506 --> 01:56:47.129
TRAVIS: Plus the Bless, thank you.

01:56:47.129 --> 01:56:49.059
LIAM: Ooh, do well.

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:51.996
TRAVIS: 21.

01:56:52.046 --> 01:56:57.424
MATT: Okay. You guys are rolling good on those
saving throws, jesus.

01:56:58.734 --> 01:57:00.689
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw, right?

01:57:00.689 --> 01:57:01.313
LAURA: Yes.

01:57:01.313 --> 01:57:02.024
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:57:02.024 --> 01:57:03.118
LAURA: What'd you roll?

01:57:03.118 --> 01:57:03.822
LIAM: 25.

01:57:03.822 --> 01:57:10.339
MATT: So you each take 14 points of force damage
and you make your respective saving throws,

01:57:10.339 --> 01:57:15.674
your constitution saving throws. Your speed is
halved until its next turn. You find gravity--

01:57:15.674 --> 01:57:21.125
you're all of a sudden yanked to the ground and your
head goes numb for a second from the shifting of

01:57:21.125 --> 01:57:27.555
the space and the weight of your body, and then you
find yourself pulled down for the next round.

01:57:27.555 --> 01:57:28.780
TRAVIS: 16? So that's--

01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:29.929
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

01:57:29.929 --> 01:57:30.675
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:57:30.675 --> 01:57:31.874
LIAM: Plus the Bless, 26.

01:57:31.874 --> 01:57:33.251
MATT: All right, you're fine.

01:57:33.252 --> 01:57:34.363
LIAM: War Caster.

01:57:34.363 --> 01:57:35.368
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

01:57:35.368 --> 01:57:36.662
MATT: And it vanishes.

01:57:36.662 --> 01:57:40.432
SAM: Oh, 28 points of damage, not 22.

01:57:40.432 --> 01:57:42.331
MATT: Oh, got you. Good to know.

01:57:42.331 --> 01:57:46.314
TALIESIN: How are you-- Everyone--

01:57:46.694 --> 01:57:48.557
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:57:49.737 --> 01:57:52.823
TALIESIN: If you are going down, you aren't going
to be down for long.

01:57:53.201 --> 01:57:55.108
LAURA: You're pretty far away from them.

01:57:55.108 --> 01:58:01.754
TALIESIN: I can move 60 feet and then cast
Healing Word as a bonus action, from 60 feet.

01:58:01.754 --> 01:58:05.064
So I've got 120 feet worth of healing.

01:58:05.224 --> 01:58:09.366
MATT: He's going to cast Vacuum Blast in
the same area.

01:58:09.366 --> 01:58:11.031
LIAM: Jeepers creepers, y'all.

01:58:11.031 --> 01:58:12.568
MATT: Which is a 20-foot radius.

01:58:12.568 --> 01:58:14.814
TRAVIS: Who did that? Same guy?

01:58:14.814 --> 01:58:15.947
MATT: The guy up top.

01:58:15.947 --> 01:58:18.468
MARISHA: Is Vacuum Blast the same as Compress
Gravity?

01:58:18.468 --> 01:58:19.150
MATT: Nope.

01:58:19.150 --> 01:58:22.147
LAURA: His shadow cast a spell, and now he gets
to cast a spell.

01:58:22.148 --> 01:58:25.627
MATT: So I need you guys also to make a
constitution saving throw, please.

01:58:25.627 --> 01:58:26.763
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

01:58:26.763 --> 01:58:29.936
TRAVIS: Thank you. Natural 20!

01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:30.942
LAURA: Yes!

01:58:31.572 --> 01:58:34.712
TRAVIS: 22. Oh, 27, sorry.

01:58:34.902 --> 01:58:39.146
LAURA: Are you making-- Is it a concentration--
no, the Wall of Fire's just there.

01:58:39.146 --> 01:58:40.862
MATT: The Wall of Fire he's making--

01:58:40.863 --> 01:58:41.449
LIAM: 24.

01:58:41.729 --> 01:58:44.698
MATT: So both of you guys take half damage.

01:58:46.608 --> 01:58:48.744
TRAVIS: Fuck. He's rocking us.

01:58:48.994 --> 01:58:51.112
LAURA: Yeah, these are really powerful guys.

01:58:51.113 --> 01:58:52.254
LIAM: Caleb's fucked up.

01:58:52.254 --> 01:58:54.302
TRAVIS: I don't know what these spells are.

01:58:54.302 --> 01:58:58.190
MATT: 17 points of force damage, each of you.
And make another constitution saving throw.

01:58:58.190 --> 01:58:59.014
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:58:59.015 --> 01:58:59.927
SAM: Are you alive?

01:58:59.927 --> 01:59:00.641
LIAM: Sure.

01:59:01.341 --> 01:59:02.397
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

01:59:03.217 --> 01:59:06.892
SAM: That Vacuum Blast sucked.

01:59:06.892 --> 01:59:08.135
MARISHA: Fuck you, Dyson.

01:59:08.136 --> 01:59:08.888
TRAVIS: 13.

01:59:09.328 --> 01:59:10.290
MATT: 13?

01:59:10.290 --> 01:59:11.361
TRAVIS: 14.

01:59:11.361 --> 01:59:14.699
MATT: 14. That's okay, because it's half the damage
you took. So you're fine.

01:59:14.699 --> 01:59:16.376
LIAM: (counting) 28.

01:59:16.377 --> 01:59:19.854
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You guys are rolling
really fucking high tonight.

01:59:19.854 --> 01:59:24.631
LIAM: Transmuter's stone, War Caster feat, Bless.
Stacks up.

01:59:24.631 --> 01:59:28.545
MARISHA: I definitely missed almost every punch,
with advantage.

01:59:28.545 --> 01:59:31.266
MATT: I know. So send some of your luck her way.

01:59:33.336 --> 01:59:36.858
LIAM: I was like "protect the melee fighter" and
now I'm getting fucked up.

01:59:36.858 --> 01:59:40.249
MATT: And Kaulden is gone.

01:59:40.249 --> 01:59:42.056
MARISHA: What do you mean? He's dead?!

01:59:42.056 --> 01:59:45.896
MATT: You watch as Kaulden gets pulled back--
the Vacuum Blast pulls you all--

01:59:45.896 --> 01:59:48.384
LAURA: What? He had piercing, blue-gray eyes!

01:59:48.385 --> 01:59:53.125
MATT: -- and because you guys made your saves, so
you are not pulled. But Kaulden gets pulled 20

01:59:53.125 --> 01:59:59.865
feet this way. The gravity shift is like this
giant vacuum hole, opens up on this side and yanks

01:59:59.865 --> 02:00:04.942
him that direction. His body get pulled into this
dark space for a second and then shredded in the

02:00:04.942 --> 02:00:09.429
middle of the air, and arms, legs, pieces start
falling and scattering on the ground.

02:00:09.789 --> 02:00:12.147
TRAVIS: Does it stay open or does it close after?

02:00:12.147 --> 02:00:21.327
MATT: It closes. It's going to step back here for
partial cover. All right, that's going to end its turn.

02:00:21.498 --> 02:00:24.348
SAM: Is its ghost-image guy gone?

02:00:24.349 --> 02:00:30.800
MATT: Gone. It seemed to disappear when it
finished casting the spell. That brings us to Caduceus.

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:37.158
TALIESIN: Ooh. I'm going to-- Oh boy.

02:00:37.158 --> 02:00:39.209
MARISHA: You still have the beetles, right?

02:00:39.209 --> 02:00:43.642
TALIESIN: I still have beetles, and beetles are
going to attack. That's a bonus action for the

02:00:43.642 --> 02:00:47.891
beetles to attack if I recall, right? Let me see.
I have a button for that.

02:00:51.381 --> 02:00:53.393
SAM: What a mess we're in.

02:00:55.378 --> 02:01:00.688
TALIESIN: The beetles are going to take another
attack, for my bonus action. Actually, how are you

02:01:00.689 --> 02:01:03.899
guys right now? No?

02:01:03.899 --> 02:01:04.993
LIAM: Real bad.

02:01:04.993 --> 02:01:07.816
MATT: You can't see them, actually. You have
no idea.

02:01:07.816 --> 02:01:10.840
TALIESIN: That's fine. The beetles are going to be
my bonus action.

02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:15.012
LIAM: Yes, totally bleeding from his eyes, sure.
Ears, eyes, nose.

02:01:17.332 --> 02:01:23.174
TALIESIN: Oh, and I add a d4 to that, not that it
matters. (counting) 23 to hit.

02:01:23.604 --> 02:01:24.639
MATT: A 23 hits.

02:01:24.639 --> 02:01:26.853
TALIESIN: They don't have advantage, do they?

02:01:26.853 --> 02:01:28.683
MATT: No. He's no longer stunned.

02:01:29.113 --> 02:01:40.387
TALIESIN: That's (counting) Eh, fuck that one. I
didn't need it anyway. Sorry I'm shaking so much;

02:01:40.387 --> 02:01:44.463
I'm really nervous. (counting) Nine points of
damage.

02:01:44.893 --> 02:01:45.884
MATT: What's it?

02:01:45.884 --> 02:01:47.646
TALIESIN: Nine points of bite damage.

02:01:47.646 --> 02:01:51.927
MATT: Nine points of damage, you got it. The
beetles are crawling into the armor plates and

02:01:51.927 --> 02:01:54.633
biting the inside. It's trying to knock it away.

02:01:54.633 --> 02:02:06.295
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little closer. I'm
going to go just a little further up against the

02:02:06.296 --> 02:02:12.910
wall. Just to the edge, so I have some cover.
A little closer. There.

02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:14.318
MATT: There's a person there.

02:02:14.319 --> 02:02:16.461
TALIESIN: Oh, who is that? I didn't see that.

02:02:16.461 --> 02:02:19.378
MATT: That's one of the remaining rangers that
still survives.

02:02:19.378 --> 02:02:25.915
TALIESIN: Oh, well I'm going to wave. I should be
about 30 feet from that creature that we're

02:02:25.915 --> 02:02:26.906
fighting, right?

02:02:26.906 --> 02:02:28.524
MATT: About there you're 30 feet--

02:02:28.524 --> 02:02:37.453
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my action until
Yasha's attack, and I'm going to hold my domain,

02:02:37.453 --> 02:02:41.908
my-- where's my brain? Channel Divinity.

02:02:41.908 --> 02:02:47.453
MATT: Okay, no worries. Oh. Actually, because you
guys did both get affected by the creature

02:02:47.453 --> 02:02:52.136
earlier, it does still get its Gravity Well ability,
so both you guys get pushed ten feet this

02:02:52.136 --> 02:03:03.643
way. Suddenly you get tugged by this shift in
gravitational forces in your area.

02:03:03.643 --> 02:03:05.199
Caduceus, that finishes your go?

02:03:05.199 --> 02:03:06.724
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm holding my--

02:03:06.725 --> 02:03:08.770
TRAVIS: What was your initiative, Caduceus?

02:03:08.770 --> 02:03:10.436
MATT: It's the barlgura's turn now.

02:03:10.436 --> 02:03:11.295
TRAVIS: Oh, it is?

02:03:11.296 --> 02:03:11.998
MATT: Yes.

02:03:11.998 --> 02:03:13.000
TRAVIS: Okay, great--

02:03:13.001 --> 02:03:14.334
TALIESIN: Path of the Grave.

02:03:14.334 --> 02:03:15.903
MATT: That's what you're holding?

02:03:15.903 --> 02:03:16.617
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:03:16.617 --> 02:03:27.338
TRAVIS: Okay, the ball-- barl-- the big demon
monkey, is going to use Running Leap, which is

02:03:27.338 --> 02:03:33.965
part of his movement. He can run 40 feet and jump
20 in the same movement. And he's going to break

02:03:33.966 --> 02:03:39.274
melee with the gnoll and head towards the caster.

02:03:39.274 --> 02:03:41.023
LIAM: Yeah. Get it, Donkey Kong!

02:03:41.023 --> 02:03:43.354
TRAVIS: He's going to jump up using
that 20 feet--

02:03:43.354 --> 02:03:44.119
MATT: Here?

02:03:44.119 --> 02:03:46.289
TRAVIS: Yeah, so he gets within melee of that
shit-ass.

02:03:46.289 --> 02:03:50.808
MATT: Okay, the gnoll does strike against it.
Natural 17, so that's 20--

02:03:50.808 --> 02:03:52.059
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

02:03:52.581 --> 02:03:54.818
MATT: It takes eight points of piercing damage.

02:03:54.818 --> 02:04:01.352
TRAVIS: Eight points, copy that. He is going to
make all three of these multiattacks with reckless

02:04:01.352 --> 02:04:09.682
against the mage at the start of its turn.
That is one bite attack and two fists,

02:04:09.682 --> 02:04:11.038
so we'll do the bite first.

02:04:11.038 --> 02:04:11.838
MATT: Okay.

02:04:12.348 --> 02:04:14.327
TRAVIS: Plus seven, that's a 20 to hit.

02:04:14.327 --> 02:04:19.545
MATT: 20 to hit? Casts Shield as a reaction, so
that misses.

02:04:19.545 --> 02:04:25.820
TRAVIS: Okay it misses, so the second one is a
fist. That is a 22 to hit.

02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:27.072
MATT: That does hit.

02:04:27.073 --> 02:04:37.668
TRAVIS: That's a 1d10 plus four, so that's ten points
of bludgeoning damage. The next fist is a 21 to hit.

02:04:38.078 --> 02:04:41.832
MATT: 21 just hits with the Shield.

02:04:42.822 --> 02:04:46.772
TRAVIS: Eight plus four, another 12 points of
bludgeoning damage.

02:04:46.772 --> 02:04:53.769
MATT: You got it. As it jumps up, you see the mage
Kryn figure, (panting) looking over at the wall,

02:04:53.769 --> 02:04:59.181
trying to start making calculations in its head,
suddenly reflects one of the attacks from it, but

02:04:59.181 --> 02:05:04.585
the other two batter it from side to side and it
catches itself from falling to its knees and it

02:05:04.586 --> 02:05:09.285
stumbles back up with the staff, trying to figure
out what its next move is going to be. That's the

02:05:09.285 --> 02:05:19.452
barlgura. It's now these guys' turn. This is going
to come this way and fire at the other gnoll. Misses.

02:05:19.453 --> 02:05:20.232
SAM: Aww.

02:05:20.232 --> 02:05:21.833
TALIESIN: God, you guys. Really.

02:05:21.833 --> 02:05:23.312
SAM: Yeah, these Muck Men suck.

02:05:23.313 --> 02:05:26.645
MATT: That actually did a fair amount of damage to
that guy over there.

02:05:26.645 --> 02:05:28.030
SAM: I can't see any of that.

02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:34.559
MATT: There you go. That guy over there is going
to fire at the Kryn guy. Does hit, actually. That

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:40.083
only does five points of piercing damage, but
still, it all helps. This one over here is going

02:05:40.083 --> 02:05:48.080
to fire a longbow as well. Natural 20. They're
rolling. They're getting a lot of crits this--

02:05:48.081 --> 02:05:52.602
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's the fifth or sixth
natural 20 you've had in this.

02:05:52.602 --> 02:05:55.104
MATT: So ten points of piercing damage.
All righty.

02:05:55.104 --> 02:05:57.483
MARISHA: They're mad because their leader's dead.

02:05:58.403 --> 02:06:03.682
MATT: Well, they don't know that. That finishes
their go. Fjord, you're up.

02:06:03.862 --> 02:06:08.902
TRAVIS: I will use my 30 feet of speed to come
towards this gnoll down here at the far end of

02:06:08.902 --> 02:06:10.504
the map, in this direction.

02:06:10.504 --> 02:06:14.876
MATT: Well, you only have 15 feet of speed because
you're slowed from the gravity.

02:06:15.807 --> 02:06:17.022
MARISHA: What?

02:06:17.022 --> 02:06:19.093
MATT: The Compress Gravity from last round.

02:06:19.093 --> 02:06:26.135
TRAVIS: Yep. So I'll just come that way 15 feet;
do do doo, do do doo.

02:06:26.415 --> 02:06:32.209
I will send two Eldritch Blasts at that gnoll.

02:06:32.209 --> 02:06:33.132
MATT: Go for it.

02:06:33.132 --> 02:06:34.004
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:06:34.004 --> 02:06:36.642
SAM: (impersonating Travis' southern accent)

02:06:40.143 --> 02:06:43.328
TRAVIS: Let's see. 20 to hit.

02:06:43.328 --> 02:06:44.478
MATT: 20 to hit?

02:06:46.483 --> 02:06:49.092
TRAVIS: That's 11 points of Eldritch Blast.

02:06:49.092 --> 02:06:50.112
MATT: That's nice.

02:06:50.112 --> 02:06:51.552
TRAVIS: Next one is 19 to hit.

02:06:51.552 --> 02:06:52.464
MATT: Hits as well.

02:06:52.464 --> 02:06:56.139
TRAVIS: That is three-- eight points of Eldritch
Blast damage.

02:06:56.139 --> 02:07:02.069
MATT: Eight points. Both impacts blast into the
gnoll. The gnoll is breathing hard and heavy. Its

02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:09.138
jaw is covered in its own gore, but you can see
it's (panting) starting to get that kind of feral,

02:07:09.138 --> 02:07:10.554
cornered look in its eyes.

02:07:10.554 --> 02:07:11.418
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:07:11.418 --> 02:07:12.285
MATT: That finishes your turn?

02:07:12.285 --> 02:07:13.071
TRAVIS: It does.

02:07:13.071 --> 02:07:14.678
MATT: All righty. It brings us to Jester.

02:07:14.944 --> 02:07:16.672
SAM: Come on, Jessie.

02:07:16.782 --> 02:07:22.992
LAURA: Okay. I am going to-- oh god, this is so
dumb.

02:07:25.102 --> 02:07:26.527
SAM: Do it for love.

02:07:26.527 --> 02:07:27.765
LAURA: Okay, I'm doing it.

02:07:27.765 --> 02:07:29.286
TALIESIN: You would do anything.

02:07:29.286 --> 02:07:34.957
LAURA: I'm going to run up to the bad guy in front
of me.

02:07:35.327 --> 02:07:39.767
MATT: All righty. (counting) 30.

02:07:40.327 --> 02:07:43.895
LAURA: And I'm going to attack him with my
handaxe.

02:07:43.895 --> 02:07:47.705
MATT: Go for it. You swing with your handaxe
(whoosh).

02:07:47.705 --> 02:07:48.883
SAM: Oh, cool.

02:07:48.883 --> 02:07:51.135
LAURA: Yeah. Do I get advantage because of my--

02:07:51.136 --> 02:07:54.016
MATT: You do, because you are technically flanking
him.

02:07:55.242 --> 02:07:58.118
LAURA: That's an 18.

02:07:58.118 --> 02:08:00.484
MATT: 18 just misses. Your handaxe--

02:08:00.484 --> 02:08:03.655
LAURA: Wait, no! That was a 12, that was
advantage! That's a 19.

02:08:03.655 --> 02:08:04.898
MATT: 19 just barely hits.

02:08:04.899 --> 02:08:10.048
LAURA: Whew, okay. Oh my god, okay. But don't I
get poison damage now?

02:08:11.068 --> 02:08:13.215
MATT: From your last level, an additional d8.

02:08:13.215 --> 02:08:13.929
LAURA: Yeah!

02:08:13.929 --> 02:08:14.984
MATT: Yeah, you would.

02:08:14.984 --> 02:08:19.965
LAURA: Okay, good. Well, that's balls.

02:08:24.282 --> 02:08:27.464
Okay, so 13.

02:08:27.464 --> 02:08:28.341
MATT: Yeah.

02:08:28.591 --> 02:08:35.555
LAURA: Okay, so that's 13 points of damage, and
then I'm going to use my bonus action to cast

02:08:35.555 --> 02:08:36.497
Spiritual Weapon.

02:08:36.497 --> 02:08:37.603
SAM: Yeah!

02:08:40.902 --> 02:08:47.461
LAURA: I'm going to cast it at-- ugh, should I do
that? Fuck it. I'm going to cast it at 4th level.

02:08:47.461 --> 02:08:48.512
SAM: Whoa.

02:08:48.512 --> 02:08:50.192
TRAVIS: (air horn blaring)

02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:56.420
MATT: So we'll bring-- whereabouts are you placing
it?

02:08:56.420 --> 02:09:00.972
LAURA: Oh, wait, when you cast a spell using a
spell slot of 3rd-level or higher-- yeah, so at

02:09:00.972 --> 02:09:05.844
fourth, I would get an extra d8. So yes, I'm going
to do it next to him and hit him again.

02:09:07.415 --> 02:09:09.747
MATT: Where are you placing the Spiritual Weapon?

02:09:09.747 --> 02:09:11.919
LAURA: Next to the guy, so I can hit.

02:09:11.919 --> 02:09:13.490
MATT: So roll the attack for it.

02:09:14.610 --> 02:09:22.039
LAURA: That is not cocked. Seven plus my thing, so
it probably doesn't hit; that's like 15.

02:09:22.039 --> 02:09:25.809
MATT: Unfortunately, no. It shakes the greatsword
and parries the blow from the giant

02:09:25.810 --> 02:09:32.499
energy-crackling lollipop that's currently resting
over its head. Deflects it off to the side.

02:09:33.239 --> 02:09:35.964
TRAVIS: Max, can you text me Ashley's iPad code?

02:09:38.271 --> 02:09:39.709
MATT: That finishes your turn?

02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:40.409
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:09:40.409 --> 02:09:46.695
MATT: All right, it's the gnolls' turn. This
gnoll's going to leap up-- actually, no. It just

02:09:46.695 --> 02:09:52.540
got blasted by that-- (counting) 30. It's going to
charge up towards you, Fjord.

02:09:52.541 --> 02:09:53.433
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:09:55.472 --> 02:09:56.731
MATT: That is 18 to hit.

02:09:56.731 --> 02:09:57.592
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:09:57.592 --> 02:10:02.784
MATT: All right. You take six points of
piercing damage.

02:10:02.784 --> 02:10:03.522
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:10:03.523 --> 02:10:06.722
MATT: It's a two-handed spear. Make another
constitution saving throw.

02:10:07.212 --> 02:10:08.324
TALIESIN: With a d4.

02:10:08.643 --> 02:10:10.992
TRAVIS: Thank you. It's a 21.

02:10:10.992 --> 02:10:22.101
MATT: You're fine. This gnoll here is going to
drop the arrows and rush up to this guy here, at a

02:10:22.101 --> 02:10:31.264
speed of 30 feet. She'll sit up here and shoot an
arrow. Can't quite get full movement there.

02:10:33.226 --> 02:10:36.822
Cocked. Misses! Goes wide.

02:10:36.954 --> 02:10:37.969
TALIESIN: Finally.

02:10:39.170 --> 02:10:40.516
MATT: Nott, you're up.

02:10:40.516 --> 02:10:51.280
SAM: I'm running that way, full sprint. (quick
footsteps, scream) Do I see the mage?

02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:56.769
MATT: You do. They have three-quarters cover.

02:10:57.739 --> 02:10:59.790
TALIESIN: But you have Sharpshooter, right?

02:10:59.791 --> 02:11:03.760
SAM: No, I have Crossbow Master.

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:06.021
TALIESIN: Crossbow-- which ignores three-quarters
cover?

02:11:06.021 --> 02:11:07.081
SAM: I don't think so.

02:11:07.081 --> 02:11:08.261
MATT: Let me double-check.

02:11:08.261 --> 02:11:09.509
SAM: I don't think so.

02:11:09.509 --> 02:11:10.380
TALIESIN: Maybe.

02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:12.318
LAURA: Maybe, though?

02:11:12.318 --> 02:11:13.411
MATT: Nope, it doesn't.

02:11:13.411 --> 02:11:14.701
TALIESIN: Nope, never mind.

02:11:14.701 --> 02:11:17.270
SAM: Three-quarters cover means I roll at
disadvantage?

02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:19.981
MATT: No, it means it gets a plus five to its
armor class.

02:11:19.981 --> 02:11:20.710
SAM: Oh, damn.

02:11:20.711 --> 02:11:23.281
TALIESIN: So you'd have to roll really high to hit
him.

02:11:23.281 --> 02:11:24.951
LAURA: Like basically a natural 20.

02:11:24.951 --> 02:11:26.070
SAM: Well, then, if I--

02:11:26.070 --> 02:11:27.246
MATT: You can do it still.

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:30.771
SAM: Can I bonus action dash, and keep running so
I can see his full body?

02:11:30.771 --> 02:11:36.120
MATT: You can. (counting) That works.

02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:37.816
SAM: Okay, let's try that.

02:11:38.226 --> 02:11:39.259
TALIESIN: Add a d4.

02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:44.151
SAM: Yeah, thank you. 14 plus nine.

02:11:44.151 --> 02:11:45.349
LAURA: Yeah!

02:11:45.349 --> 02:11:47.060
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:51.707
SAM: And he's engaged, so I'm going to take that
sneak attack!

02:11:53.125 --> 02:11:54.698
LAURA: That's good.

02:11:54.698 --> 02:11:58.609
SAM: Yeah, it is. 27 points of damage.

02:11:58.609 --> 02:11:59.883
MATT: Ooh, nice!

02:12:01.343 --> 02:12:06.427
SAM: And that's all I got. I used action, bonus,
run-- that's it. That's all I got.

02:12:06.427 --> 02:12:08.048
LAURA: No Fury of the Small again?

02:12:08.048 --> 02:12:10.099
SAM: Nope. Just once per rest.

02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:12.884
MATT: That finishes your go, Nott. Yasha's turn.

02:12:12.884 --> 02:12:19.582
TRAVIS: Yasha will rush up on the Kryn, and will
grab the Magician's Judge.

02:12:20.612 --> 02:12:22.475
MATT: To where? Here?

02:12:22.675 --> 02:12:30.068
TRAVIS: Anywhere that's within melee is great. And
take two swipes.

02:12:30.068 --> 02:12:31.138
MATT: Go for it.

02:12:31.138 --> 02:12:36.458
TRAVIS: Reckless. That is a 23 to hit.

02:12:37.118 --> 02:12:38.165
MATT: 23 hits.

02:12:38.235 --> 02:12:43.590
TRAVIS: The first one has the Divine Fury, which
is 3d-- Are you &lt;i&gt;fucking&lt;/i&gt; kidding me?

02:12:44.451 --> 02:12:45.500
MARISHA: That's bad.

02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:56.612
TRAVIS: Only one of those. I'm going to just roll
one. Damn it. (counting) All right, so ten points

02:12:56.612 --> 02:12:57.627
of slashing damage.

02:12:57.627 --> 02:12:58.444
MATT: Okay.

02:12:58.914 --> 02:13:00.120
TALIESIN: Doubled.

02:13:00.730 --> 02:13:01.614
TRAVIS: Why?

02:13:01.614 --> 02:13:04.442
TALIESIN: Because I'm doubling this first attack.

02:13:04.442 --> 02:13:06.400
MATT: With his ability Eyes of the Grave.

02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.379
TRAVIS: So 14?

02:13:07.909 --> 02:13:11.665
MATT: No, double the dice, is what it is. Plus the
bonus.

02:13:11.665 --> 02:13:14.340
TALIESIN: Is it double the dice? I thought they
have--

02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:17.294
MATT: Oh, no, they're vulnerable to it. So it is
double damage.

02:13:17.294 --> 02:13:19.052
TRAVIS: Okay, so 20 on the first one.

02:13:19.052 --> 02:13:21.063
MATT: It's not a crit, but that's amazing.

02:13:21.063 --> 02:13:22.117
MARISHA: That's cool.

02:13:22.117 --> 02:13:25.016
TRAVIS: Reckless for the second attack, which is
22 to hit.

02:13:25.016 --> 02:13:26.164
MATT: 22 hits.

02:13:26.164 --> 02:13:31.388
TRAVIS: Awesome. That is 16.

02:13:31.388 --> 02:13:34.690
MATT: Stunning Strike is my fucking bane. 16
points of damage.

02:13:34.690 --> 02:13:36.072
MARISHA: Is he still stunned?

02:13:36.073 --> 02:13:40.500
MATT: No, but there's an entire round of combat
where he just-- everyone got to fuck with him.

02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:42.166
TRAVIS: 19, sorry. I forgot raging.

02:13:42.166 --> 02:13:46.130
MATT: All right. Cool. I mean, good for you.

02:13:46.130 --> 02:13:47.246
TRAVIS: And that's it.

02:13:47.246 --> 02:13:55.821
MATT: Awesome. That finishes your go for Yasha,
top of the round. Now it's the Kryn's turn. He's

02:13:55.821 --> 02:14:17.909
going to bonus action, he's going to manifest its
echo, right there. It's then going to make-- yeah,

02:14:17.909 --> 02:14:20.574
he's going to take all three attacks against
you, Jester.

02:14:20.574 --> 02:14:21.688
SAM: Oh no.

02:14:21.689 --> 02:14:23.021
LAURA: No, that makes sense.

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:24.309
MARiSHA: Slicey blade dude?

02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:25.021
MATT: Yep.

02:14:25.021 --> 02:14:25.837
MARISHA: Slicey--

02:14:25.837 --> 02:14:27.042
TRAVIS: Sentinel?

02:14:27.042 --> 02:14:28.909
MATT: Yasha gets Sentinel attack.

02:14:29.399 --> 02:14:31.724
MARISHA: Because I'm not there. She can do it.

02:14:33.604 --> 02:14:46.434
MATT: First attack against you. That is 21 to hit.
Yasha can make her attack. You take 18 points

02:14:46.434 --> 02:14:47.571
of slashing damage.

02:14:47.571 --> 02:14:48.380
LAURA: Okay.

02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:50.826
SAM: Okay, that's fine. Shrug that off.

02:14:51.196 --> 02:14:52.293
TRAVIS: 20 to hit?

02:14:52.563 --> 02:14:53.564
MATT: That hits.

02:14:58.724 --> 02:15:00.559
TRAVIS: (counting)

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:06.703
MATT: Actually, it's going to use its reaction to
use Shadow Martyr. No, it didn't roll high enough.

02:15:06.703 --> 02:15:08.446
So yeah, it still takes the damage.

02:15:08.446 --> 02:15:10.345
TRAVIS: 15 points of slashing damage.

02:15:10.345 --> 02:15:16.969
MATT: He's starting to breathe heavy. He's looking
really rough. Second strike against you.

02:15:17.619 --> 02:15:19.710
It's going to be 20 to hit.

02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:20.530
LAURA: Yes.

02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:25.272
MATT: That is 16 points of slashing damage.

02:15:25.272 --> 02:15:26.705
LAURA: Cool. Yeah, I'm fine.

02:15:26.705 --> 02:15:31.323
MATT: The first strike hits you with the blade,
and all of a sudden out of the corner of your eye,

02:15:31.323 --> 02:15:36.545
a shadow version of it appears, cuts through you,
and then vanishes. Right as you're reacting from

02:15:36.545 --> 02:15:41.761
that, above you a spark of dark energy in the
shape of a warrior comes streaking down from above

02:15:41.761 --> 02:15:45.639
for a third strike. That is going to be
18 to hit?

02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:47.046
LAURA: 18.

02:15:47.136 --> 02:15:50.039
MATT: Still hits you. That is--

02:15:50.039 --> 02:15:51.849
LAURA: I wish I had the Bless.

02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:58.121
MATT: It won't help for this, unfortunately. 15
points of slashing damage.

02:15:59.012 --> 02:16:00.218
SAM: Easy. No problem.

02:16:00.218 --> 02:16:02.169
MATT: It's going to get an action surge--

02:16:02.169 --> 02:16:06.797
LAURA: (groan) Oh no! Why you do this to me?! I
said you looked nice tonight!

02:16:06.797 --> 02:16:10.915
MATT: (chuckling) I know you did. This isn't me.
This is him.

02:16:10.916 --> 02:16:12.338
LIAM: That was Matt.

02:16:12.338 --> 02:16:14.250
TRAVIS: He's smiling under that helm.

02:16:14.250 --> 02:16:16.550
MATT: It's going to--

02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:21.059
LAURA: Oh yeah! I'm going to use my reaction of
Hellish Rebuke.

02:16:21.059 --> 02:16:23.618
MATT: Go for it! All right. So roll damage on
that.

02:16:23.988 --> 02:16:25.517
LIAM: Maybe you'll kill him.

02:16:25.527 --> 02:16:28.000
LAURA: Do I have to roll to attack on
Hellish Rebuke?

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:33.179
MATT: No, it's a saving throw against your Hellish
Rebuke. What's the save on that? Is it dexterity,

02:16:33.179 --> 02:16:34.054
or wisdom?

02:16:34.054 --> 02:16:36.966
LAURA: Hellish Rebuke, I think, is based on
charisma?

02:16:36.966 --> 02:16:40.418
MATT: Well, the DC of the ability is based on
your charisma.

02:16:40.418 --> 02:16:42.572
LAURA: Okay, yeah. Sorry.

02:16:42.572 --> 02:16:43.521
MATT: It's okay.

02:16:43.531 --> 02:16:44.793
LIAM: It's been two weeks.

02:16:45.003 --> 02:16:47.624
LAURA: Hellish Rebuke. It's 12.

02:16:47.624 --> 02:16:54.091
MATT: 12. Okay. That is-- What's the ability for
Hellish Rebuke?

02:16:54.091 --> 02:16:54.971
LAURA: Dex.

02:16:54.971 --> 02:16:59.921
MATT: Dex, yeah. That puts him at 12 actually,
exactly. He rolled a nine, plus three.

02:17:00.210 --> 02:17:02.782
LAURA: Sweet. So he doesn't take anything,
or does he--

02:17:02.782 --> 02:17:04.073
MATT: He takes half damage.

02:17:04.073 --> 02:17:05.039
SAM: Oh! Okay, okay.

02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:12.054
LAURA: I have a 16, so eight points of cold
damage. As I just go, (shouting) Ow!

02:17:12.054 --> 02:17:19.672
MATT: (groan) You see the ice shards through the
armor, bits of it filling the gaps in its plate

02:17:19.672 --> 02:17:21.404
where it's been taking wounds--

02:17:21.404 --> 02:17:31.250
LAURA: Ooh! Oh, it's probably too late to say. I
have my duplicate within five feet, so if my

02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:33.995
duplicate's up, it's like a thing!

02:17:33.995 --> 02:17:37.117
SAM: Oh, it's a 50/50 chance which one they
attack, right?

02:17:37.117 --> 02:17:38.499
LAURA: Or something; hold on.

02:17:38.499 --> 02:17:39.656
MATT: I'll double check.

02:17:40.537 --> 02:17:43.493
SAM: They have to roll to see which one's the
right one, right?

02:17:43.993 --> 02:17:46.247
TALIESIN: New stuff! We have new stuff!

02:17:46.517 --> 02:17:53.028
LAURA: No, this is old. I just am never attacking.&lt;i&gt;
I&lt;/i&gt; have advantage on attack rolls, that's what it--

02:17:53.028 --> 02:17:56.972
MATT: Correct. That's what it does. So it doesn't
have an effect that. Now you know.

02:17:57.541 --> 02:17:58.802
LAURA: Motherfuck!

02:17:58.852 --> 02:18:11.761
MATT: So action surge, next attack on you, 21! Ten
plus 11. You take 17 points of slashing damage.

02:18:11.761 --> 02:18:12.833
LAURA: I'm done.

02:18:13.013 --> 02:18:14.153
TRAVIS: Unconscious?

02:18:14.373 --> 02:18:16.081
MATT: Jester's unconscious.

02:18:17.050 --> 02:18:22.608
LAURA: It's my fault. I went up there, you know? I
was being brave.

02:18:22.608 --> 02:18:23.891
MARISHA: He hit real hard.

02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:34.304
MATT: The figure goes away. After cutting through
Jester, you watch as another one of its shadow

02:18:34.304 --> 02:18:42.952
forms appear, and it's going to cut through the
guy behind him. Misses! Natural five. Wait. Plus

02:18:42.952 --> 02:18:54.302
11. No, that still hits. The shadow version steps
up behind the wounded dragonborn (panting) and

02:18:54.302 --> 02:19:02.672
then carves across his throat. (groan) Falls off.
The shadow clone echo dissipates. The third and

02:19:02.673 --> 02:19:11.506
final one is going to strike down towards... Yasha
looks pretty beefy, it's going to attack you. It's

02:19:11.505 --> 02:19:15.594
technically with advantage because you're on the
ground.

02:19:15.594 --> 02:19:16.827
LAURA: I mean, I'm unconscious.

02:19:16.827 --> 02:19:20.627
MATT: Yeah. Well, I mean, it has to still roll.
Wait no, it's an automatic crit.

02:19:20.628 --> 02:19:24.489
TALIESIN: Can I discount the auto crit?

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:26.918
MATT: You've already used your reaction to
improve--

02:19:26.918 --> 02:19:28.451
TALIESIN: Fuck, I have; motherfucker.

02:19:28.451 --> 02:19:30.933
MATT: So it's two death saving throws on you,
Jester.

02:19:30.933 --> 02:19:34.771
SAM: Ooh boy. Who is near her?

02:19:34.772 --> 02:19:36.356
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I got it.

02:19:36.356 --> 02:19:38.697
MATT: It's going to go (counting)--

02:19:38.697 --> 02:19:40.314
TALIESIN: Oh, is Yasha going to--?

02:19:40.314 --> 02:19:42.169
LAURA: Yasha already took her reaction.

02:19:42.169 --> 02:19:42.972
MATT: 25, 30.

02:19:42.972 --> 02:19:44.464
MARISHA: Piece of fucking shit!

02:19:44.464 --> 02:19:47.129
SAM: Wait, when he moved away, does anyone get
an attack?

02:19:47.129 --> 02:19:49.775
MATT: Nope, because Yasha already used her
reaction.

02:19:49.775 --> 02:19:52.627
LAURA: When I came over there, I thought Beau was
next to me.

02:19:52.628 --> 02:19:56.294
MARISHA: But she hit him, but it wasn't in an
escape, so does she get to move?

02:19:56.294 --> 02:19:58.626
TRAVIS: Wait, Sentinel drops them to zero, right?

02:19:58.626 --> 02:20:02.109
MARISHA: But I think it's when they're fleeing. I
don't know if it counts.

02:20:02.109 --> 02:20:05.627
MATT: Wait, so can she hit him with the thing, and
it might have done that.

02:20:05.627 --> 02:20:07.292
MARISHA: She hit him with Sentinel.

02:20:07.292 --> 02:20:10.056
MATT: That's right. Hold on. It might prevent the
movement.

02:20:10.057 --> 02:20:12.157
MARISHA: She drops him to zero, but let me--

02:20:12.157 --> 02:20:14.297
MATT: You're right. It might do it based on--

02:20:14.298 --> 02:20:16.017
TRAVIS: (singing) Handbooker Helper!

02:20:16.017 --> 02:20:19.539
TALIESIN: Is an action surge a bonus, or can you
just take an action surge?

02:20:19.539 --> 02:20:21.776
MATT: You were a fighter, you should know this!

02:20:21.776 --> 02:20:24.112
TALIESIN: I should know this, but I'm so
panicked!

02:20:24.112 --> 02:20:26.539
MATT: No, you just take it, it's not a bonus
action.

02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:28.300
TALIESIN: That's right. Motherfucker!

02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:32.544
MARISHA: "When you hit a creature with an
opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes

02:20:32.544 --> 02:20:34.067
"zero for the rest of the turn."

02:20:34.067 --> 02:20:38.309
MATT: An &lt;i&gt;opportunity&lt;/i&gt; attack. It wasn't an
opportunity attack, though. It says here, with--

02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:42.746
MARISHA: "Creatures within five feet of you
provoke opportunity attacks from you, even if they

02:20:42.746 --> 02:20:47.464
"take the disengage action. When a creature within
five feet of you makes an attack against a target

02:20:47.465 --> 02:20:52.362
"other than you, and the target doesn't have-- you
can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack."

02:20:52.362 --> 02:20:57.032
MATT: A melee weapon attack is not an opportunity
attack, so it did not reduce his speed. Sorry. It

02:20:57.032 --> 02:21:01.559
only reduces their speed if they're moving away
that triggers it. It does not reduce their speed

02:21:01.559 --> 02:21:03.604
if they get hit from hitting somebody else.

02:21:03.604 --> 02:21:05.658
LIAM: It's that they're planted and attack.

02:21:05.658 --> 02:21:06.360
MATT: Correct.

02:21:06.361 --> 02:21:07.070
LIAM: Got it.

02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:09.735
MATT: All right. That finishes its turn. Beau,
you're up.

02:21:09.736 --> 02:21:10.444
SAM: Boof.

02:21:10.444 --> 02:21:14.153
MARISHA: Wait, Nott or Yasha didn't go? Jester
just went, and it was that guy--

02:21:14.154 --> 02:21:17.678
MATT: Well no. We're at the top of the round. He's
at the top of the round.

02:21:17.678 --> 02:21:20.948
MARISHA: Oh. Oh, fuck me! Is someone else getting
Jes?

02:21:20.948 --> 02:21:25.911
TALIESIN: I got Jes. Something awful is going to
happen.

02:21:26.681 --> 02:21:30.164
MARISHA: 45. He's 45 feet away from me, right?
That guy?

02:21:30.164 --> 02:21:31.506
MATT: You don't know. Maybe.

02:21:32.086 --> 02:21:34.676
MARISHA: I think he is. I'm going to make the
run.

02:21:36.326 --> 02:21:40.872
MATT and MARISHA: (counting) 45.

02:21:41.672 --> 02:21:43.032
MARISHA: Motherf--!

02:21:44.492 --> 02:21:49.067
MATT: You're running past the giant flames. It's
not hurting you, but it's super hot, and you can

02:21:49.067 --> 02:21:52.059
hear them right next to you, and he's &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; out
of reach.

02:21:55.909 --> 02:21:57.499
MARISHA: That sucks.

02:22:03.286 --> 02:22:07.422
I'm going to do it. I'm going to
spend a ki point to close the five feet.

02:22:07.422 --> 02:22:09.757
It seems really wasteful of a ki point, but...

02:22:09.757 --> 02:22:10.811
MATT: You move in.

02:22:10.811 --> 02:22:15.231
MARISHA: I'm doing it. Pop pop!

02:22:15.231 --> 02:22:16.983
MATT: Go for it! Make your attacks.

02:22:16.983 --> 02:22:28.557
MARISHA: Oh my god. Try and find right under his
helmet. That nerve. I've been using my fists

02:22:28.557 --> 02:22:33.186
because they're magical. Has anyone hit this guy
with a non-magical attack? You have, right?

02:22:34.016 --> 02:22:35.371
TRAVIS: Who, the Kryn?

02:22:35.371 --> 02:22:38.455
TALIESIN: I assume the fighters have been--

02:22:38.455 --> 02:22:40.456
MARISHA: Hitting with non-magical attacks?

02:22:40.456 --> 02:22:41.133
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:22:41.133 --> 02:22:43.035
MARISHA: I'm going to hit with my staff.

02:22:43.035 --> 02:22:43.925
MATT: Go for it.

02:22:43.925 --> 02:22:45.018
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

02:22:45.018 --> 02:22:47.866
LIAM: One of them's cocked. 12 is cocked.

02:22:47.866 --> 02:22:49.017
MATT: Yeah. Reroll that.

02:22:49.017 --> 02:22:50.064
MARISHA: No, it's not!

02:22:50.064 --> 02:22:54.585
LIAM: We discounted a-- It was, before you moved
it. We've thrown out a 20 that was that cocked!

02:22:54.585 --> 02:22:56.914
MATT: It is now. It's 12. It's fine. She chose
it.

02:22:56.915 --> 02:22:59.951
MARISHA: It should still be good. Yes. Hits.

02:22:59.951 --> 02:23:01.732
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:23:04.932 --> 02:23:06.021
MARISHA: Six damage.

02:23:06.021 --> 02:23:07.373
MATT: Six damage, all right.

02:23:07.373 --> 02:23:13.458
MARISHA: Stunning Strike. Right? Just going for
that jawline, going for that nerve!

02:23:15.059 --> 02:23:19.224
MATT: He's stunned. Natural seven.

02:23:20.354 --> 02:23:22.188
TALIESIN: (groans)

02:23:24.498 --> 02:23:25.832
MARISHA: Punching him again.

02:23:25.832 --> 02:23:29.214
MATT: Go for it. You have advantage on the strike,
because he's stunned.

02:23:30.503 --> 02:23:37.509
MARISHA: Yep. It hits, I'm sorry. 23.

02:23:37.509 --> 02:23:39.732
MATT: 23. That hits. Go and roll damage.

02:23:39.827 --> 02:23:44.710
MARISHA: Still using my staff. Oh, that's good!
13.

02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:53.946
MATT: Nice! (crack, panting) Yeah? That's your
turn, right?

02:23:53.946 --> 02:23:56.048
MARISHA: He's looking bad? Well, I have a bo--

02:23:56.048 --> 02:23:57.807
MATT: No, you used your bonus action.

02:23:57.807 --> 02:24:01.494
MARISHA: Nope, I used it to Step of the Wind. Yep!
That's my turn. That's my turn!

02:24:01.494 --> 02:24:02.930
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

02:24:03.430 --> 02:24:09.385
LIAM: I checked a line of sight over Travis'
shoulder so I can see the magic user's head, so

02:24:09.385 --> 02:24:13.812
I'm going to just going to toss a Fire Bolt his
way. Three-quarter covers--

02:24:13.812 --> 02:24:14.736
MATT: Go for it.

02:24:14.736 --> 02:24:15.592
LIAM: --The enemy.

02:24:15.672 --> 02:24:17.542
LAURA: Nugget is very concerned right now.

02:24:17.542 --> 02:24:19.163
LIAM: It's at disadvantage, right?

02:24:19.164 --> 02:24:20.979
MATT: No, it gets plus five to its AC.

02:24:20.979 --> 02:24:22.331
LIAM: Oh, he gets plus five.

02:24:22.442 --> 02:24:25.251
TALIESIN: Plus d4 to your attack, if you're doing
an attack.

02:24:25.252 --> 02:24:43.166
LIAM: Yes, I am. That's pretty good, hold on.
Plus, shit. Shit balls. (muttering) Goddamn it.

02:24:43.166 --> 02:24:48.493
Can't remember my shit; coming up, I think it's
plus six, so 26.

02:24:48.494 --> 02:24:50.534
MATT: 26 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

02:24:50.534 --> 02:24:56.565
LIAM: Okay. That's 2d10. Ten.

02:24:56.925 --> 02:25:02.520
MATT: Ten points of fire damage. Off the side of
his shoulder, pats it out.

02:25:02.521 --> 02:25:07.254
LIAM: And I'm going to use my movement, which is
halved because the gravitational effect, I think,

02:25:07.254 --> 02:25:15.425
to go over behind that tall outcropping of rock
upstage. I'm going to-- no, right up against the

02:25:15.425 --> 02:25:23.994
one that's-- no, behind this; hiding from the
magic user. And for my bonus action, I'm just

02:25:23.995 --> 02:25:27.499
going to pull out a healing potion, and not drink
it and just hold it.

02:25:27.499 --> 02:25:30.069
MATT: Okay. You got it. That finishes your turn,
Caleb?

02:25:30.069 --> 02:25:30.786
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;.

02:25:30.786 --> 02:25:35.365
MATT: All right. It's now the mage's turn. The
mage is going to take an attack of opportunity

02:25:35.365 --> 02:25:38.605
from the barlgura. So go ahead and roll for a
strike.

02:25:39.791 --> 02:25:48.181
TRAVIS: (singsong) Pull that back up! Bite attack:
that's a 13.

02:25:48.382 --> 02:25:57.518
MATT: 13 misses. Wide swing, just as the mage
ducks down beneath. (counting)

02:25:57.544 --> 02:25:59.097
SAM and LAURA: Oh no!

02:25:59.367 --> 02:26:05.721
MATT: Reaches over and grabs him and you watch as
they both vanish. Dimension Dooring out of sight.

02:26:06.306 --> 02:26:11.645
MARISHA: I can't do anything with them? Does that
provoke an attack of opportunity?

02:26:11.645 --> 02:26:20.046
MATT: Nope. It's a Teleport. The flames flicker,
and you angrily stomp around the space where it

02:26:20.046 --> 02:26:23.892
was. You glance about. Make a perception check.

02:26:27.133 --> 02:26:27.916
MARISHA: 15.

02:26:29.136 --> 02:26:34.122
MATT: It's hard to tell on the horizon where they
went, amongst the rocks and other bits of terrain.

02:26:34.122 --> 02:26:39.639
They're out of sight. The flames still burning
from the fire wall, and you look about and can see

02:26:39.639 --> 02:26:46.181
the various scattered dead bodies of the various
rangers who you had just met. And that's where

02:26:46.182 --> 02:26:47.657
we're going to take our break.

02:26:48.467 --> 02:26:50.660
SAM: That was a satisfying fight?

02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:52.183
LIAM: Lot of cool shit happened.

02:26:52.183 --> 02:26:53.821
MATT: A lot of cool shit happened.

02:26:53.821 --> 02:26:56.247
TRAVIS: We're not technically out of initiative
yet.

02:26:56.247 --> 02:26:56.991
MATT: No!

02:26:56.991 --> 02:26:58.043
LIAM: There's a gnoll!

02:26:58.043 --> 02:27:01.044
MATT: I know. We're going to come back at that
here in a second.

02:27:01.044 --> 02:27:02.329
SAM: Jester is almost dead.

02:27:02.329 --> 02:27:04.054
TALIESIN: Jester's fine. I got that.

02:27:04.054 --> 02:27:06.629
MATT: Well, how many hit points does the barlgura
have?

02:27:06.629 --> 02:27:07.384
TRAVIS: 33.

02:27:07.384 --> 02:27:11.960
MATT: I'll say for the purposes, because otherwise
we'll be running through the motions here. The

02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:16.895
gnoll's not going to last very long, and barlgura
either, with all of you guys focused on it. You

02:27:16.896 --> 02:27:21.805
quickly dispatch the barlgura and the gnoll, take
a moment to breathe--

02:27:21.805 --> 02:27:23.458
TALIESIN: You're at 30 hit points.

02:27:23.458 --> 02:27:25.536
LAURA: I'm at 30 hit points. I'm not dead.

02:27:25.536 --> 02:27:28.203
MATT: There you go. And then we're going to take a
break.

02:27:28.203 --> 02:27:29.069
TRAVIS: Okay!

02:27:29.849 --> 02:27:40.676
MATT: Tonight, as our Wyrmwood giveaway, we have
this delightful cherrywood dice box from our

02:27:40.676 --> 02:27:47.696
friends here, leather interior, to give away. To
possibly win this, head on over to the Twitch chat

02:27:47.696 --> 02:27:52.641
on the Critical Role Twitch stream, that's
twitch.tv/criticalrole. Enter the keyword "date"!

02:27:52.641 --> 02:27:58.143
D-A-T-E, because it's Valentine's Day, and you're
having a date with us. But enter it once, only

02:27:58.143 --> 02:28:04.492
once. Once again, only the US and Canada,
excluding Quebec, because of stupid laws. But

02:28:04.492 --> 02:28:07.194
we'll have a winner for you when you come back in
just a little bit! See you in a sec.

02:28:07.943 --> 02:28:09.065
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:28:09.065 --> 02:28:13.392
MATT: And welcome back, everyone. Before we get
into it, we'll have Laura and Travis joining us in

02:28:13.392 --> 02:28:16.255
just a second. They're dealing with mommy/daddy
stuff.

02:28:16.255 --> 02:28:18.043
SAM: (loudly) They are fucking!

02:28:18.043 --> 02:28:19.805
MARISHA: Just a quickie.

02:28:19.915 --> 02:28:28.049
MATT: We do have a winner for our giveaway, which
is procrastinate_or. Procrastinate underscore O-R,

02:28:28.052 --> 02:28:36.222
congratulations. You won tonight, we'll have that
sent to you ASAP. Well done. So, bringing us back

02:28:36.222 --> 02:28:42.037
in: there, standing amongst the base of the
Ashkeeper Peaks, overlooking the wastes of Xhorhas

02:28:42.037 --> 02:28:47.148
before you and the path you've chosen to take, you
can see the various slaughtered gnolls scattered

02:28:47.148 --> 02:28:52.873
amongst the nearby rock and stone, as well as the
bodies of the individuals you had even just

02:28:52.873 --> 02:29:00.380
previously met-- this scouting regiment out of
Bladegarden. Only three survivors remain, and

02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:07.259
they, not even acknowledging your presence, start
gathering the corpses of their friends and laying

02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:11.712
them side by side, checking them for any goods
that they won't be needing.

02:29:11.712 --> 02:29:15.619
MARISHA: I don't say anything, but I just slowly
start helping them.

02:29:16.690 --> 02:29:17.518
MATT: Okay.

02:29:18.487 --> 02:29:21.628
SAM: (trickling liquid)

02:29:21.628 --> 02:29:22.832
LIAM: Full bladder?

02:29:23.801 --> 02:29:26.231
SAM: Sorry. Did you ever heal Jester?

02:29:26.531 --> 02:29:34.695
TALIESIN: Aw, shit. Jester's dead now, I assume.
Yeah, I healed Jester. I'm taking care of Jester for this.

02:29:38.469 --> 02:29:40.263
LIAM: How many of them are left?

02:29:40.923 --> 02:29:42.089
MATT: There are three.

02:29:42.089 --> 02:29:42.792
LIAM: Three.

02:29:42.792 --> 02:29:45.394
MATT: Three survivors of what was originally 11.

02:29:45.694 --> 02:29:48.082
MARISHA: Three of 11, wow.

02:29:48.712 --> 02:29:51.775
SAM: Anything on any of the gnolls' bodies?

02:29:51.975 --> 02:29:53.992
MATT: You can make an investigation check.

02:29:54.726 --> 02:29:55.763
SAM: 22.

02:29:56.353 --> 02:30:05.785
MATT: 22, all right. Amongst the gnolls, you
manage to pull together what comes to about 26

02:30:05.785 --> 02:30:09.316
gold pieces, 16 silver pieces, and 31 copper.

02:30:09.316 --> 02:30:13.896
LAURA: Aw, man. Imagine what kind of loot we would
have gotten off the other guys.

02:30:13.896 --> 02:30:17.732
MARISHA: I know. There are only three of the Muck
Men left.

02:30:17.732 --> 02:30:19.198
LAURA: Did we loot them?

02:30:19.198 --> 02:30:20.675
SAM: (laughing) They're alive.

02:30:20.675 --> 02:30:23.414
MATT: There are three living Muck Men that are
currently--

02:30:23.415 --> 02:30:25.705
MARISHA: They are gathering their dead brethren.

02:30:25.715 --> 02:30:28.285
MATT: Caduceus has brought you from the brink of
death.

02:30:28.285 --> 02:30:30.716
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. You're feeling okay, though.

02:30:30.716 --> 02:30:34.369
LAURA: I feel pretty good, minus the fact that I
almost died.

02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:37.862
LIAM: I'm going to start limping over to the
closest Muck Man.

02:30:38.222 --> 02:30:47.322
MATT: You walk over and you see a stern-faced
woman with ratty, brown, mousy hair that is pulled

02:30:47.322 --> 02:30:52.758
into a tight braid that disappears into the back
of the hood. The hood is currently slipped back,

02:30:52.758 --> 02:30:58.582
she looks-- blood pooling down one side of the
forehead that has now begun to dry and mingle with

02:30:58.582 --> 02:31:03.804
the sweat. She doesn't pay any attention as you
approach and is in the process of folding arms

02:31:03.804 --> 02:31:05.947
over and checking pockets.

02:31:06.247 --> 02:31:12.774
LIAM: Smear away the blood coming out of my eyes
and nose from that gravitational bullshit and will

02:31:12.774 --> 02:31:25.609
crouch down next to her and attempt to help in any
way I can, and ask: How-- hoo, my head-- frequent

02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:26.746
a thing is this?

02:31:28.456 --> 02:31:36.436
MATT: "This is not very frequent. We usually do
not have to reveal ourselves for others. It was

02:31:36.436 --> 02:31:42.912
"careless of Kaulden. But a lesson he paid for."

02:31:43.762 --> 02:31:48.605
LIAM: How far off are you from the nearest group
of your brethren?

02:31:49.585 --> 02:31:54.442
MATT: "As far as I know, there are maybe three
other scouting regiments out amongst the

02:31:54.442 --> 02:32:02.116
"Ashkeepers, but we all keep to ourselves. We are
to return to Bladegarden within the week. Looks

02:32:02.116 --> 02:32:09.873
"like we'll do our best to bring back what we can,
effects for the families. Unfortunately, we're not

02:32:09.873 --> 02:32:11.547
"enough to carry the bodies back."

02:32:15.288 --> 02:32:17.986
SAM: Do we need to bury them or burn them or--

02:32:17.986 --> 02:32:19.874
LIAM: What do you want to do with them?

02:32:21.730 --> 02:32:29.614
MATT: You can see her eyes flitter amongst the
corpses and go, "I'm not superstitious, but I do

02:32:29.614 --> 02:32:40.259
"know of the whispers of various necromantic
terrors to the far east. I say probably best we

02:32:40.259 --> 02:32:51.403
"burn them." She continues to rummage through and
pulls out some coin, pulls out some arrows. Takes

02:32:51.403 --> 02:32:56.534
off a section of the armor and inspects it; it's
too damaged. Sets it back down.

02:32:56.984 --> 02:33:01.615
LIAM: To the east. If we head east, we are going
to have problems with the undead?

02:33:01.745 --> 02:33:04.176
MATT: "I don't know. I have not been that far
east."

02:33:04.176 --> 02:33:05.568
LIAM: But you hear this.

02:33:05.808 --> 02:33:17.395
MATT: "I've heard that there are-- and this is old
history of Xhorhas. There were betrayers that were

02:33:17.395 --> 02:33:25.774
"dabbling with various means of creating more
powerful armies. I've seen many different

02:33:25.774 --> 02:33:32.644
"shadow-based creatures that wander the waste, but
I have not crossed undead myself. As I've said, I

02:33:32.644 --> 02:33:35.924
"am not superstitious, but better safe
than sorry."

02:33:37.754 --> 02:33:46.007
LIAM: Okay, thank you. Excuse me. Caleb lies flat
on his back and stares at the sky and starts into

02:33:46.007 --> 02:33:47.463
Arcane Recovery.

02:33:50.133 --> 02:33:53.401
MARISHA: You said you're heading straight back to
Bladegarden?

02:33:53.871 --> 02:33:57.351
MATT: "We're not going to do much good with a
small party like this."

02:33:57.352 --> 02:34:02.083
MARISHA: Are there more of you back at base camp?
Are you going to switch out the party?

02:34:02.083 --> 02:34:09.445
MATT: "I think so, or at least replace those we've
lost and head back out. This is a time of war.

02:34:10.115 --> 02:34:16.783
"We cannot stop until there is some end
to this insanity."

02:34:17.883 --> 02:34:19.089
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

02:34:20.879 --> 02:34:27.252
SAM: Did your fallen friends have any horses or
carts or any way of traveling?

02:34:28.050 --> 02:34:33.688
MATT: "We travel by foot across the mountain
range. It's the safest to stay out of sight.

02:34:35.138 --> 02:34:42.619
"If you're heading east, it's the safest for you as
well. It's very hard to stay out of sight when

02:34:42.619 --> 02:34:44.991
"you're on horseback or carrying a cart."

02:34:45.871 --> 02:34:51.527
LAURA: Do those cloaks keep you hidden very well?
They blend in with the environment.

02:34:51.528 --> 02:34:53.200
MATT: "This is the intended color."

02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:57.329
LAURA: Do you have any extras you would be willing
to part with?

02:34:57.879 --> 02:35:01.302
MATT: She opens her hands amongst the various
bodies on the ground.

02:35:01.892 --> 02:35:03.557
LAURA: I think we should take them.

02:35:03.557 --> 02:35:04.680
MARISHA: Yeah, I agree.

02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:05.646
TALIESIN: Of course.

02:35:06.206 --> 02:35:10.244
MATT: There's enough for all of you, though a few
of them are bloodstained.

02:35:10.244 --> 02:35:14.706
LAURA: I can cast Mending on them. Try to clean
them up a little bit, heal them.

02:35:14.706 --> 02:35:16.514
MATT: Mending fixes; it doesn't clean.

02:35:16.514 --> 02:35:17.328
LAURA: Cool.

02:35:17.418 --> 02:35:19.987
TALIESIN: They're going to get bloodstained
eventually.

02:35:19.997 --> 02:35:23.525
MATT: That's a Prestidigitation thing. (slurring)
Prestidigitation.

02:35:24.804 --> 02:35:31.168
TALIESIN: If you'd like, we can build a pyre and
wait till you've had some time to move on before

02:35:31.168 --> 02:35:34.922
we set it. We'll set it when it's time for us to
leave, if that helps.

02:35:36.232 --> 02:35:37.391
MATT: I appreciate that.

02:35:37.391 --> 02:35:38.341
TALIESIN: 'Course.

02:35:39.711 --> 02:35:41.554
MATT: Give us a few more minutes.

02:35:42.705 --> 02:35:46.572
MARISHA: Take your time. Talk to me
before you leave.

02:35:48.245 --> 02:35:55.230
MATT: "All right." The three of them gather
whatever things seem to be important. They throw

02:35:55.230 --> 02:36:01.965
the bodies on a pile, quietly bow their heads for
a moment of silence, and then turn back around,

02:36:01.965 --> 02:36:08.844
throwing their cloaks over their shoulders, their hoods
up, bows at the side. The woman approaches you.

02:36:09.284 --> 02:36:18.685
MARISHA: In that time, I've scribbled a note to
Dairon. If you're heading anywhere, if you happen

02:36:18.685 --> 02:36:26.110
to run into a soldier by the name of Dairon with
the Cobalt Soul, could you give this to her?

02:36:29.438 --> 02:36:30.720
MATT: "I'll do my best."

02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:35.490
MARISHA: She was injured. Pretty sure here in
Ashgarden or Ashgrove--

02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:37.230
MATT: Bladegarden.

02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:38.459
MARISHA: That place.

02:36:39.140 --> 02:36:40.259
LIAM: Ashley Johnson.

02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:41.567
SAM: Garden garden.

02:36:42.377 --> 02:36:44.069
TALIESIN: The garden of earthly gardens.

02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:46.545
MARISHA: Last I heard, she was recovering in
Bladegarden.

02:36:47.185 --> 02:36:49.521
MATT: "Well, I'll ask around."

02:36:50.652 --> 02:36:51.740
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:36:52.530 --> 02:37:02.218
LAURA: I hate to ask this, but since you guys are
heading back, would you have any supplies that

02:37:02.218 --> 02:37:10.581
would help us on our way out? Kaulden was going to
give us something, I think. It's a terrible ask, I know.

02:37:10.831 --> 02:37:15.380
MATT: "Well, we only need enough food for the
three of us to get back. Any sort of rations you

02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:24.329
"would need for your journey, they're in that pile
there." There's a small cluster of satchels that

02:37:24.329 --> 02:37:31.984
were taken from the bodies that look to contain
trail rations and other bits of edible materials

02:37:31.984 --> 02:37:32.871
for the journey.

02:37:33.501 --> 02:37:36.412
LAURA: Cool, cool. I'll take one just to have.

02:37:36.412 --> 02:37:39.716
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

02:37:43.853 --> 02:37:45.951
LAURA: Ten! (grumbling)

02:37:47.091 --> 02:37:48.572
MATT: You find some food.

02:37:49.392 --> 02:37:50.196
LAURA: Balls.

02:37:50.406 --> 02:37:51.326
SAM: Good job.

02:37:51.326 --> 02:37:52.242
LAURA: Thanks.

02:37:53.455 --> 02:38:01.313
MATT: The three of them gather, give you a nod,
stoic, emotionless. They've probably seen some

02:38:01.313 --> 02:38:08.780
shit, and this is not an occurrence that is new to
them. They turn around and begin hiking their way

02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:10.598
back up the side of the mountain.

02:38:13.515 --> 02:38:22.273
SAM: Well, this place is not great, but we knew
that coming in. We survived our first encounter

02:38:22.273 --> 02:38:28.597
with baddies here, so we should look on
the bright side.

02:38:29.707 --> 02:38:36.429
LAURA: What if the whole city is filled with
people that are as strong as they were?

02:38:36.429 --> 02:38:40.308
TALIESIN: I think if that were true, the war would
be over by now.

02:38:41.798 --> 02:38:44.259
LAURA: That's true. That's true!

02:38:45.314 --> 02:38:54.957
TALIESIN: I think that probably they're mostly
people. We came across a couple very serious

02:38:54.957 --> 02:38:59.049
people, and we're all standing.

02:38:59.049 --> 02:39:01.239
LAURA: (whispers) I don't like serious people.

02:39:01.239 --> 02:39:02.037
SAM: Mm-mm.

02:39:02.537 --> 02:39:09.852
TALIESIN: If you'll give me a minute to help put
this pyre together, I can also give everybody a

02:39:09.852 --> 02:39:13.881
little bit-- help heal a little bit.

02:39:14.291 --> 02:39:17.625
LAURA: How about you focus on that, and we'll get
the bodies together?

02:39:17.666 --> 02:39:23.560
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing
(counting) on everybody but me.

02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:25.323
MARISHA: Are we taking a short rest?

02:39:25.323 --> 02:39:26.576
SAM: We can do that, too.

02:39:26.576 --> 02:39:28.151
TRAVIS: I'd be most appreciative.

02:39:28.151 --> 02:39:32.349
TALIESIN: I'll do both. I'm going to cast Prayer
of Healing, and we'll take a short rest.

02:39:32.349 --> 02:39:33.346
MATT: There you go.

02:39:33.346 --> 02:39:36.572
MARISHA: I'm going to lay down for a minute, get
my ki points back.

02:39:36.572 --> 02:39:43.511
TALIESIN: That's 2d8 plus five. Everybody gains 13
hit points.

02:39:44.251 --> 02:39:45.942
LAURA: Thank you, Caduceus.

02:39:46.702 --> 02:39:50.266
TALIESIN: Take a little bit of the edge off before
you go into a short rest.

02:39:52.446 --> 02:39:53.405
MATT: Yeah.

02:39:55.115 --> 02:39:56.176
LIAM: Short resting.

02:39:57.578 --> 02:40:04.054
MATT: As you take the time to gather your wits
about you, to tend to your wounds, to have

02:40:04.054 --> 02:40:10.911
Caduceus help you recover a bit from the strain
and pain of the battle that transpired, you

02:40:10.911 --> 02:40:18.719
complete your short rest. The sky is still
relatively dark and cloudy. The smell in the air

02:40:18.719 --> 02:40:24.153
lets you know that rain is probable before
nightfall. In the moment, you're thankful that

02:40:24.153 --> 02:40:32.606
these heavier, thicker gray cloaks might help you not
soak to the entire bone. What would you like to do?

02:40:35.256 --> 02:40:42.944
SAM: Well, since we're in Xhorhas, maybe one of us
should take a cue from these guys and look at the

02:40:42.944 --> 02:40:49.747
dodeca-fucking-hedron. Right? Moving forward? Or
should we wait until we need it?

02:40:49.747 --> 02:40:54.353
LAURA: Well, we can use it once a day, so one of
us should look at it regardless.

02:40:54.353 --> 02:40:56.973
MARISHA: 24 hours, right?

02:40:58.313 --> 02:41:00.961
TRAVIS: I might've missed something. Why are we
looking at it once a day?

02:41:01.481 --> 02:41:03.342
TALIESIN: So that someone has the edge.

02:41:03.922 --> 02:41:06.735
TRAVIS: Are we not afraid that that is a beacon
to us?

02:41:06.735 --> 02:41:12.923
LAURA: Well, we can keep it in the bag and look at
it in there. We don't have to take it out or anything.

02:41:12.923 --> 02:41:13.846
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:41:17.116 --> 02:41:18.867
MARISHA: You want to take a look?

02:41:19.436 --> 02:41:21.690
SAM: I don't know if I'll need it, but sure.

02:41:21.691 --> 02:41:23.092
MARISHA: It's your husband.

02:41:23.232 --> 02:41:28.042
SAM: That's true. I will trip balls
and look at it.

02:41:28.392 --> 02:41:31.542
TRAVIS: Yeah! (warping sounds)

02:41:31.712 --> 02:41:36.542
MATT: You take your fragment of possibility.

02:41:36.792 --> 02:41:39.043
TRAVIS: (singing) It's a star man!

02:41:39.043 --> 02:41:41.484
MATT: Placing it back into your satchel.

02:41:41.484 --> 02:41:44.341
LAURA: Stays in the bag the whole time. We don't
take it out.

02:41:44.341 --> 02:41:46.486
LIAM: Stick your face in the other dimension.

02:41:46.486 --> 02:41:47.622
LAURA: Yeah, basically.

02:41:50.272 --> 02:41:52.709
SAM: Do we just walk on, then?

02:41:53.056 --> 02:41:56.049
TALIESIN: I say we head east. That's the way that
they said.

02:41:56.699 --> 02:42:01.040
SAM: Is there any cover out there in the fields
and plains below us?

02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:11.022
MATT: There are low batches of scrub brush here
and there. There are areas where sometimes

02:42:11.022 --> 02:42:20.949
clusters of rocks and natural boulders that had
either rolled down the mountains or were

02:42:20.949 --> 02:42:26.694
jettisoned by long-dormant vulcan activity--
volcanic activity can be seen. Yeah. Not doing

02:42:26.694 --> 02:42:38.025
that crossover. No. There are occasional things
that you could camp against, but it is an open,

02:42:38.025 --> 02:42:46.814
badland plains. They say "the wastes of Xhorhas"
because it is an open valley of gray and brown and

02:42:46.814 --> 02:42:54.735
dust and muck, occasional dotted trees that are
the hardier types that survive, but aren't vibrant

02:42:54.735 --> 02:42:57.303
and pretty. They exist.

02:42:57.813 --> 02:43:04.691
LIAM: Sorry, if any of you take a minute, can you
figure out which way this worm traveled?

02:43:05.251 --> 02:43:08.168
LAURA: Oh, I guess we can look around and see.

02:43:08.338 --> 02:43:10.980
MARISHA: I'll look for tracks. Investigation?

02:43:10.980 --> 02:43:12.502
TALIESIN: I'll go in on that.

02:43:12.503 --> 02:43:14.997
MATT: It'll be a survival check to look for
tracks.

02:43:14.997 --> 02:43:16.895
LIAM: Best way through?

02:43:18.562 --> 02:43:20.002
TALIESIN: 25. Natural 20.

02:43:20.142 --> 02:43:22.217
LAURA: Ooh, 21.

02:43:22.298 --> 02:43:23.381
MARISHA: 13.

02:43:23.731 --> 02:43:32.720
MATT: Okay. We'll say you guys manage to find
where the slithered aspects of the worm push. It

02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:38.965
is definitively going east. It makes its way
beyond the rocks and heads into the fields. We'll

02:43:38.966 --> 02:43:43.495
say for the remainder of the day you could follow
the tracks. You'll have to make an additional

02:43:43.495 --> 02:43:51.261
attempt, each day of travel, to try and keep an
eye on it, but you have an idea of where it went.

02:43:52.181 --> 02:43:56.898
LIAM: We're out in the open; we're sitting ducks.
I feel like we should put these cloaks to good use

02:43:56.898 --> 02:44:00.919
and try to be careful. It will slow us, but...

02:44:02.629 --> 02:44:04.769
MARISHA: Move cautiously? I agree.

02:44:04.769 --> 02:44:09.149
LIAM: Move cautiously. Follow the path of this
worm as long as possible because they are from

02:44:09.149 --> 02:44:13.831
here; they know this place. Presumably they know
the path of least resistance. There will still be

02:44:13.831 --> 02:44:18.371
resistance, but at least-- let's go.

02:44:18.987 --> 02:44:24.235
MARISHA: I think as long as it still follows that
track that the Muck Men--

02:44:24.235 --> 02:44:26.491
LAURA: You're sure you want to save him, yeah?

02:44:26.491 --> 02:44:31.970
SAM: I'm pretty sure. I don't want to feel guilty
about this, but I'm a hundred percent sure that I

02:44:31.970 --> 02:44:34.325
would like to save my husband's life, yes.

02:44:34.426 --> 02:44:37.417
(laughter)

02:44:38.634 --> 02:44:40.487
SAM: But I'll tell you if that changes.

02:44:40.487 --> 02:44:41.683
LAURA: Yeah, let me know.

02:44:42.279 --> 02:44:46.897
TALIESIN: When we're ready to go, I'm going to use
the tinder box to start the pyre, but not until

02:44:46.897 --> 02:44:52.736
we're ready to go. I'm not going to wait for it to
fully catch because it's going to call attention.

02:44:52.936 --> 02:44:58.468
MATT: As you guys gather the rest of your
supplies, pick yourselves up, apply the cloaks of

02:44:58.469 --> 02:45:00.126
those that fell in combat--

02:45:00.126 --> 02:45:02.189
LAURA: I'll cast Pass Without a Trace on us as we
move.

02:45:02.189 --> 02:45:03.839
LIAM: I was just going to ask.

02:45:04.969 --> 02:45:10.513
MATT: Are you guys moving at a stealthed pace or
trying to be stealthy at a standard pace?

02:45:10.592 --> 02:45:15.933
LIAM: I feel, on the mountainside at least, we
should go stealthily.

02:45:18.063 --> 02:45:22.159
TALIESIN: At least today. Tomorrow we may move
quickly.

02:45:22.159 --> 02:45:23.072
LAURA: Half speed?

02:45:23.542 --> 02:45:30.334
MATT: It's 18 miles per day of travel at a slow
pace. You don't cover as much ground.

02:45:30.945 --> 02:45:32.169
SAM: Let's do it.

02:45:32.169 --> 02:45:33.678
LIAM: For now, yeah.

02:45:36.288 --> 02:45:38.201
LAURA: That's really slow, you guys.

02:45:39.825 --> 02:45:41.855
MATT: You can all make stealth checks.

02:45:44.664 --> 02:45:46.390
LAURA: (high, silly voice) Add ten!

02:45:47.062 --> 02:45:56.164
TRAVIS: Nice job, Yasha. 31 for Yasha. 21 for
Fjord.

02:45:56.164 --> 02:45:57.425
LAURA: Caleb, you're blessed.

02:45:58.175 --> 02:45:59.286
LIAM: Doesn't matter.

02:45:59.556 --> 02:46:00.461
MARISHA: 19.

02:46:02.231 --> 02:46:03.123
SAM: 24.

02:46:03.123 --> 02:46:07.814
LAURA: Oh. No, you're blessed. You get advantage,
that's what I said. I gave you the Blessing of the Trickster.

02:46:07.815 --> 02:46:13.862
LIAM: Oh, I thought it was plus stuff. That's
better. That is 11.

02:46:13.862 --> 02:46:16.197
TALIESIN: That's plus ten, really?

02:46:16.197 --> 02:46:17.422
LIAM: No, I rolled--

02:46:17.422 --> 02:46:18.862
TRAVIS: Pass without a trace.

02:46:18.862 --> 02:46:20.737
LIAM: Oh, 21. Thank you.

02:46:21.379 --> 02:46:22.205
LAURA: 30.

02:46:22.675 --> 02:46:23.625
TALIESIN: 14.

02:46:23.645 --> 02:46:31.671
MATT: Okay. Moving on, you eventually, within the
next couple hours, find yourselves at the base of

02:46:31.671 --> 02:46:38.950
the mountain. The standard slate gray rock and
stone that has accompanied you across the

02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:50.534
Ashkeeper begins to give way to the somewhat ruddy
and brown of the valley floor. The bushes and

02:46:50.534 --> 02:46:58.057
brush you come across here is gray to light brown.
Some of it is bristled with thorns. It is a very

02:46:58.058 --> 02:47:08.406
unwelcoming landscape. There are areas where you
can see bits of the ground seem to be blasted with

02:47:08.406 --> 02:47:19.388
glass. You would recognize this as the remnants of
lightning strikes that have hit the ground or

02:47:19.388 --> 02:47:23.493
other objects in the vicinity. Powerful lightning
strikes.

02:47:25.553 --> 02:47:27.432
MARISHA: That's scary.

02:47:28.418 --> 02:47:30.842
TALIESIN: If storms hit, we may need to take
cover.

02:47:30.843 --> 02:47:33.027
MATT: Just as it begins to rain gently.

02:47:33.461 --> 02:47:35.789
SAM: Hey, it sounds like rain.

02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:41.441
MATT: It's cold rain. Make a nature check for me.

02:47:44.534 --> 02:47:46.485
TALIESIN: Five.

02:47:46.486 --> 02:47:48.738
MATT: Five. It's raining.

02:47:48.738 --> 02:47:50.806
TALIESIN: My nature's really low.

02:47:50.807 --> 02:47:51.659
MATT: I know.

02:47:52.199 --> 02:47:53.830
SAM: Aren't you a nature guy?

02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:57.238
TALIESIN: I spent most of my time in one place. I
don't really--

02:47:57.238 --> 02:48:03.599
MATT: There's a difference between loving nature
and being able to empathize with nature, and

02:48:03.599 --> 02:48:08.005
having the specific knowledge to ascertain
patterns.

02:48:09.735 --> 02:48:11.249
TALIESIN: It's raining.

02:48:13.284 --> 02:48:17.716
LIAM: How cold is it here, or not, out of
curiosity?

02:48:17.716 --> 02:48:27.833
MATT: In comparison, the weather is as chilly as
the empire is, but you're out in the middle of the

02:48:27.833 --> 02:48:37.757
open. There's no looming hearth or home.
Thankfully these cloaks that you did take from the

02:48:37.757 --> 02:48:43.515
troop, they are treated with some sort of material
which makes them a little water resistant. You

02:48:43.515 --> 02:48:50.329
don't soak entirely through. Your boots get soaked
and muddy. Elements do get damp, but as long as

02:48:50.329 --> 02:48:58.708
you stay bundled within the cloak, you manage to
stay somewhat warm and not thoroughly waterlogged.

02:49:00.332 --> 02:49:09.026
Continuing on across the badlands, the rain
bearing down, no signs of lightning or thunder.

02:49:11.007 --> 02:49:19.253
Eventually the sun begins to set. It begins to
grow dark. Yasha points out across the way, you

02:49:19.254 --> 02:49:25.602
can see another one of those large beasts that you
had seen. At this distance, it's about maybe three

02:49:25.602 --> 02:49:26.881
quarters of a mile off.

02:49:29.491 --> 02:49:30.444
SAM: How big?

02:49:31.439 --> 02:49:33.119
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

02:49:34.779 --> 02:49:38.945
SAM: A straight intelligence? 14.

02:49:40.155 --> 02:49:44.780
MATT: Gauging the distance from here and the way
that it's interacting with the scenery around it,

02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:51.158
you watch as it reaches over and puts it hand up
against a tree. You have a better view of it now,

02:49:51.158 --> 02:50:01.725
even through the rain, and you can see it has four
arms. It walks like a gorilla, looks to be furred,

02:50:01.726 --> 02:50:09.278
with these squat little legs, and it makes its way
across the landscape slowly. It reaches out and

02:50:09.278 --> 02:50:15.408
grabs a tree, one of those dried trees, and bends
and snaps it as it moves past. Grabs it and begins

02:50:15.408 --> 02:50:22.637
scratching its shoulder with it. You guess it's
probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 feet

02:50:22.638 --> 02:50:23.794
to the shoulder.

02:50:24.404 --> 02:50:26.879
LIAM: Bipedal, four arms?

02:50:26.879 --> 02:50:34.712
MATT: It could probably be bipedal, but it tends
to use all four arms to walk along. You're not

02:50:34.712 --> 02:50:39.592
entirely certain where it sits between that space.
You don't see a face. You can't see the detail.

02:50:39.593 --> 02:50:42.536
You can see its outline and the basic shape of its
body.

02:50:42.646 --> 02:50:44.645
LAURA: I think he's probably nice.

02:50:45.757 --> 02:50:49.724
TALIESIN: Do we want to bed down now and start up
early?

02:50:50.024 --> 02:50:50.938
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:51.078 --> 02:50:51.921
SAM: Sure.

02:50:51.921 --> 02:50:52.751
TRAVIS: No objection.

02:50:53.591 --> 02:51:01.243
MARISHA: I think any time traveling during the sun
is probably best. I don't know if we want to risk

02:51:01.243 --> 02:51:03.075
traveling at night right now.

02:51:03.725 --> 02:51:08.018
LAURA: We'll have a little bubble then. It
protects us from everything, right, Caleb?

02:51:08.018 --> 02:51:09.146
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:51:09.736 --> 02:51:10.611
LAURA: Okay.

02:51:12.481 --> 02:51:16.289
TALIESIN: Probably as dark as you can make it.

02:51:18.440 --> 02:51:27.773
LIAM: I can make it dark as pitch. Okay. I'm going
to do the nighttime routine. I'm going to cast the

02:51:27.773 --> 02:51:33.423
dome. I'm going to use my silver thread to put an
Alarm around it, and I'm going to ask Frumpkin to

02:51:33.424 --> 02:51:41.368
sit about 80 feet, 70 feet away from the dome in
the direction of that hulking creature and keep

02:51:41.368 --> 02:51:43.630
extra watch, in addition to any watch we do.

02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:49.382
LAURA: While he's doing that, I'm going to cast
Glyph of Warding--

02:51:51.322 --> 02:51:52.247
TRAVIS: Really?

02:51:52.247 --> 02:52:02.273
LAURA: Mm-hm. And I'm going to cast it with
Hold Person prepared in it.

02:52:02.273 --> 02:52:05.052
MATT: Okay, fair enough. Where are you placing
it?

02:52:05.628 --> 02:52:08.521
LAURA: Next to our bubble.

02:52:08.521 --> 02:52:12.264
MATT: Okay, you got it. That lasts for how long?

02:52:13.884 --> 02:52:21.091
LAURA: It takes an hour, but I think it-- let's
see.

02:52:21.091 --> 02:52:23.582
SAM: Duration: until dispelled or triggered.

02:52:24.062 --> 02:52:28.066
MATT: I would recommend letting the rest of the
party know where the glyph is placed.

02:52:28.067 --> 02:52:31.587
LAURA: Yes, yes. The glyph's right there. I think
it only activates under--

02:52:31.587 --> 02:52:33.264
MATT: Worst breakfast wake-up ever.

02:52:33.834 --> 02:52:42.707
LAURA: According to physical characteristics,
creature kind. I can say specifically if it's--

02:52:43.707 --> 02:52:44.903
MATT: A type of creature.

02:52:44.903 --> 02:52:48.806
LAURA: Yeah, like a Kryn or something like that.

02:52:48.806 --> 02:52:49.728
MATT: You got it.

02:52:49.728 --> 02:52:51.107
TRAVIS: "Krin?" "Kreen?"

02:52:51.107 --> 02:52:51.877
MATT: "Kreen."

02:52:51.877 --> 02:52:52.781
SAM: Crick.

02:52:52.921 --> 02:52:53.785
LAURA: No!

02:52:54.335 --> 02:52:55.445
TRAVIS: Terrible.

02:52:57.855 --> 02:52:59.589
SAM: I'm a fictional racist.

02:52:59.589 --> 02:53:01.599
(laughter)

02:53:01.610 --> 02:53:07.630
LAURA: Terrible. I can cast--
I can cast Sending.

02:53:08.781 --> 02:53:13.532
TALIESIN: Any light-based magic that you have,
too. We should probably set up for tomorrow.

02:53:25.072 --> 02:53:30.103
TRAVIS: I'll take first watch, too, because I don't
think everybody passing out is a good idea no more.

02:53:30.103 --> 02:53:31.205
MARISHA: I agree.

02:53:31.575 --> 02:53:38.090
MATT: As you guys bed down amongst this darkened
dome for the evening, make a perception check for me.

02:53:40.447 --> 02:53:42.607
TRAVIS: Natural 20. 21.

02:53:42.607 --> 02:53:44.074
MARISHA: Whoa doggy.

02:53:45.624 --> 02:53:52.207
LIAM: Before passing out I take one of those rags
that I keep, and I put it over the driftglobe, and

02:53:52.207 --> 02:53:57.887
say: Tawaj. Leave it floating in the middle of the
globe so you have some dim light.

02:53:57.887 --> 02:54:01.664
MATT: Okay. That does not protrude beyond the
dome, correct?

02:54:01.664 --> 02:54:04.068
LIAM: Because it's opaque from the outside, yeah.

02:54:04.068 --> 02:54:06.228
MATT: Cool, so you have a little night light.

02:54:06.268 --> 02:54:12.801
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like
nice pleasant sounds of a running stream, so it

02:54:12.801 --> 02:54:17.626
sounds like we're in a peaceful place. Birds,
crickets chirping.

02:54:17.626 --> 02:54:19.101
MATT: It's a little spa day.

02:54:19.101 --> 02:54:21.217
LIAM: The dome does not hold in sound, FYI.

02:54:21.217 --> 02:54:22.369
LAURA: Oh, it doesn't?

02:54:23.599 --> 02:54:24.854
TALIESIN: Beau, can I borrow your goggles?

02:54:24.854 --> 02:54:27.168
LAURA: Oh, never mind. I don't do that.

02:54:27.168 --> 02:54:28.747
MARISHA: Can you borrow my what?

02:54:28.747 --> 02:54:29.891
TALIESIN: Your goggles.

02:54:29.891 --> 02:54:30.966
MARISHA: Oh, yes.

02:54:30.967 --> 02:54:32.142
TALISIN: Thank you.

02:54:34.991 --> 02:54:37.410
MATT: What did you roll, Fjord?

02:54:37.410 --> 02:54:44.403
TRAVIS: Natural 20. 21 total. That big-ass
perception bonus.

02:54:44.403 --> 02:54:50.975
MATT: Yeah. As you guys rest for the evening,
Fjord, you do keep an eye out. It's hard to see

02:54:50.975 --> 02:54:57.159
much beyond a certain radius because when it's
night here, it's night. The clouds are thick

02:54:57.159 --> 02:55:03.250
enough, and it rains throughout the night. You do
not see the moon, either of them. No light. You do

02:55:03.250 --> 02:55:12.304
not see any movement. It feels strangely
reminiscent of some of the dreams you've had where

02:55:12.304 --> 02:55:21.766
you found yourself in the middle of darkness. That
cold, looming, creeping thought in the back of

02:55:21.766 --> 02:55:28.339
your head of how far away you are from your
promised goal to a specific entity.

02:55:30.129 --> 02:55:31.194
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:55:32.581 --> 02:55:37.909
MATT: Nothing seems to catch your attention.
Nothing draws too close to the exterior of this

02:55:37.909 --> 02:55:45.891
dome to warrant waking the rest of your group.
Eventually you can find yourself to rest. Who

02:55:45.891 --> 02:55:48.841
would like to take second watch? Caduceus, roll
perception.

02:55:53.477 --> 02:56:00.907
TALIESIN: 27. Natural 19. With the goggles, just
for fun.

02:56:00.907 --> 02:56:04.714
MATT: With the goggles? Same scenario. You can see
pretty well within a short radius, but the rest of

02:56:04.714 --> 02:56:08.640
it is this beautiful, pitch-black nothing.

02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:10.750
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice.

02:56:10.750 --> 02:56:20.000
MATT: A different interpretation of the same
space. Morning comes to you, the low gray light.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:29.593
The rain does seem to be getting a bit heavier.
You're preparing yourselves for exiting as the

02:56:29.594 --> 02:56:32.674
dome itself eventually gives way.

02:56:32.674 --> 02:56:33.712
[music cuts off]

02:56:34.322 --> 02:56:35.787
TALIESIN: That was creepy.

02:56:35.787 --> 02:56:37.405
LAURA: Whoa, that was weird.

02:56:37.405 --> 02:56:41.516
MATT: That was my iPad getting a notification.

02:56:41.516 --> 02:56:44.327
TALIESIN: The spookiness of Valentine's Day.

02:56:44.451 --> 02:56:47.492
(laughter)

02:56:47.671 --> 02:56:51.458
TRAVIS: Any new creatures or intrusions in our
immediate space with the coming light?

02:56:51.458 --> 02:56:53.257
SAM: Did the glyph fire or anything?

02:56:53.257 --> 02:56:54.928
MATT: The glyph did not fire off.

02:56:55.338 --> 02:56:57.028
MARISHA: Is your cat still alive?

02:56:57.858 --> 02:56:58.532
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;.

02:56:58.532 --> 02:57:03.159
MATT: The bad news is you're out in the middle of
an open field. The good news is... you're out in

02:57:03.159 --> 02:57:04.303
the middle of an open field.

02:57:04.303 --> 02:57:05.749
TRAVIS: You can see it coming.

02:57:05.749 --> 02:57:10.230
MATT: Yeah. For the most part, it's going to be
hard for things to surprise you if you're being

02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:18.903
slow and stealthy. For the most part. With the day
ahead of you, who's keeping watch?

02:57:18.903 --> 02:57:20.505
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out.

02:57:20.505 --> 02:57:23.268
MATT: All right, so you're keeping an eye out?
Both of you?

02:57:23.269 --> 02:57:25.836
LAURA: I'll help him! Oh, never mind. You can help
him.

02:57:25.836 --> 02:57:27.838
MATT: Okay, you guys rolling individually?

02:57:27.838 --> 02:57:29.650
TALIESIN: I'll take advantage on this.

02:57:29.650 --> 02:57:34.734
TRAVIS: Now that we are on the open plains, should
we move at the slightly quicker pace, but still stealthy?

02:57:34.734 --> 02:57:36.047
SAM: At a medium pace?

02:57:36.047 --> 02:57:38.756
MATT, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: (singing) At a medium
pace.

02:57:39.946 --> 02:57:42.473
TALIESIN: That's awful. That's an 11.

02:57:42.571 --> 02:57:44.178
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

02:57:44.667 --> 02:57:46.801
TALIESIN: Those were two terrible rolls.

02:57:46.801 --> 02:57:51.229
LAURA: Ooh! Somebody should look at our mote.
Somebody should have looked at our mote while we

02:57:51.229 --> 02:57:52.417
were still in the thingy.

02:57:52.417 --> 02:57:54.796
SAM: Someone take a look. I looked at it
yesterday.

02:57:54.797 --> 02:57:57.941
TRAVIS: We're out in the middle of a field; let's
give it to Ducey.

02:57:58.801 --> 02:58:01.715
MATT: You take your mote of possibility.

02:58:02.277 --> 02:58:11.082
LIAM: I'm fighting a very miffed and wet cat who's
been out all night and is crawling up inside of my

02:58:11.082 --> 02:58:15.683
cloak and hood and doing the scarf thing. It's wet
on my neck, but okay.

02:58:17.492 --> 02:58:21.777
MATT: You all bundle up your cloaks a little
heavier and trudge forward. You are going at a

02:58:21.777 --> 02:58:24.259
normal pace, so everyone make
a stealth check again.

02:58:24.974 --> 02:58:27.499
TALIESIN: Are we doing a plus ten?

02:58:28.220 --> 02:58:30.885
MATT: Are you still casting Pass Without a Trace
on this?

02:58:32.236 --> 02:58:35.992
LAURA: Yeah, sure. Let's do it. Sorry, I'm healing
my blink dog.

02:58:39.608 --> 02:58:47.377
TRAVIS: Natural 20 for Fjord, 31, and 27 for
Yasha.

02:58:47.617 --> 02:58:48.426
MARISHA: 25.

02:58:48.746 --> 02:58:49.599
LIAM: 28.

02:58:49.990 --> 02:58:50.909
SAM: 40.

02:58:51.529 --> 02:58:54.714
MATT: (sighs) There it is.

02:58:56.006 --> 02:58:57.130
LAURA: 28.

02:58:57.470 --> 02:59:00.831
TALIESIN: 23. 22, sorry.

02:59:01.452 --> 02:59:10.225
MATT: Moving at normal pace, you feel pretty
stealthy. It's easier for things to see you at a

02:59:10.226 --> 02:59:17.155
normal pace, but you all rolled pretty high.
Pushing on for this secondary day, you begin to

02:59:17.155 --> 02:59:25.818
see, eventually, a river on the horizon, heading
from south to north. Yasha--

02:59:25.818 --> 02:59:28.110
LAURA: This is the river that we have to cross!

02:59:29.233 --> 02:59:35.728
MATT: Yasha points out and says, "This is known as
the Ifolon River."

02:59:35.728 --> 02:59:37.712
SAM: The Hifolon?

02:59:37.712 --> 02:59:44.717
MATT: Ifolon. "Stems from the Sorrow Weep waters,
the lake to the south."

02:59:46.966 --> 02:59:48.986
Sorrow&lt;i&gt;seep.&lt;/i&gt;

02:59:50.318 --> 02:59:51.742
LAURA: That's the lake.

02:59:53.363 --> 02:59:54.714
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:59:54.714 --> 02:59:56.574
TALIESIN: We're at the edge of the map.

02:59:56.574 --> 02:59:58.249
MARISHA: Edge of the map!

02:59:58.249 --> 03:00:01.262
SAM: Oh boy, this is scary, guys. If only we had a
fucking horse.

03:00:01.262 --> 03:00:03.287
MARISHA: Is that Ifolon with an I?

03:00:03.377 --> 03:00:05.296
MATT: With an I. I-F-O-L-O-N.

03:00:05.486 --> 03:00:08.435
LIAM: I fell on the river and all I got was this
lousy t-shirt.

03:00:09.835 --> 03:00:11.107
MATT: No matter what name.

03:00:11.107 --> 03:00:13.843
TALIESIN: How's the water smell? Does it smell
putrid?

03:00:13.843 --> 03:00:18.457
MATT: You are too far away from it. It's just on
the horizon. You could get to it probably at your

03:00:18.457 --> 03:00:23.081
current pace by the end of the day. If you were
moving slower, you wouldn't get there yet, because

03:00:23.081 --> 03:00:29.459
you are going a normal pace. And you rolled--?

03:00:29.459 --> 03:00:30.357
TALIESIN: 11.

03:00:30.647 --> 03:00:37.243
MATT: Right, okay. You move on for the first half
of the day, keeping quiet, muttering to each other

03:00:37.248 --> 03:00:44.444
for your own sanity, discussing what may be
awaiting you further and further east in this

03:00:44.444 --> 03:00:56.137
landscape still heavily marred by the wars of the
gods before the Divergence. There's a moment where

03:00:56.138 --> 03:01:11.978
you're all moving forward and you hear gravelly
voices, muffled and soft, a little ways out that

03:01:11.978 --> 03:01:17.533
way. The rest of you pick up on it. Actually, it
would be Jester and Beauregard pick up on it.

03:01:17.533 --> 03:01:19.528
LAURA: (whispering) Oh, did you hear that?

03:01:19.529 --> 03:01:21.198
MARISHA: (whispering) Was that you?

03:01:21.198 --> 03:01:23.052
LAURA: No, there's people or something.

03:01:23.052 --> 03:01:24.993
MARISHA: It's not your Thaumaturgy thing?

03:01:24.994 --> 03:01:25.776
LAURA: No.

03:01:25.776 --> 03:01:26.654
MARISHA: Fuck.

03:01:26.654 --> 03:01:27.983
LAURA: Everybody drop down.

03:01:27.983 --> 03:01:30.173
TRAVIS: What do you mean drop down, like flat?

03:01:30.173 --> 03:01:31.909
LAURA: We hear voices!

03:01:33.309 --> 03:01:37.413
MATT: You hear one go (speaking guttural language).

03:01:37.414 --> 03:01:38.892
LIAM: I cast Tongues.

03:01:38.892 --> 03:01:43.939
MATT: Another voice begins to yell. You cast
Tongues on yourself? All right. You hear it

03:01:43.939 --> 03:01:52.301
transition from guttural barks in a goblinoid
language into a-- and actually, let me double

03:01:52.301 --> 03:01:53.528
check one thing here.

03:01:53.528 --> 03:01:58.541
SAM: I speak Goblin. And Halfling, for some
reason.

03:01:58.541 --> 03:02:01.339
MATT: Yeah, you would understand it, actually.

03:02:01.999 --> 03:02:03.385
LAURA: What do they say?

03:02:05.249 --> 03:02:11.726
MATT: The voice you hear says, "Quick, grab your
things and run. It's coming!"

03:02:13.226 --> 03:02:20.591
SAM: Everyone, the bad guys are saying it's scary and
they need to run, so we should probably do the same.

03:02:21.201 --> 03:02:28.258
MATT: As this is happening, you now begin to see,
lower near one of the plain areas where there's a

03:02:28.258 --> 03:02:40.467
cluster of rocks, a gray, heavy-shouldered deer--
that you've seen keep at a distance from you-- has

03:02:40.467 --> 03:02:51.048
been killed. You see four or five humanoid
figures, though tall and covered in fur. You

03:02:51.048 --> 03:02:57.838
recognize them as bugbears. They're grabbing their
things off the ground, and looking back in the

03:02:57.838 --> 03:02:59.116
direction you came from.

03:03:00.056 --> 03:03:02.340
LIAM: Which is back where we saw the big things.

03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:03.827
SAM: Oh, something's behind us!

03:03:03.827 --> 03:03:05.492
TRAVIS: Like the worm or something?

03:03:05.492 --> 03:03:07.547
SAM: I don't know, but let's go. Let's run.

03:03:07.547 --> 03:03:12.076
LIAM: Turning around and looking back. No, the big
loping creatures we saw at a distance, maybe.

03:03:12.076 --> 03:03:16.686
MATT: Though all of you look around and you don't
see anything on the horizon directly behind you,

03:03:16.686 --> 03:03:24.768
Caduceus. You look out for a second, and look up
and see a hawk or a bird of prey, it seems, with

03:03:24.769 --> 03:03:33.550
the wingspan. And it just gets bigger, and bigger.
You guys all glance up, and from what you can see,

03:03:33.550 --> 03:03:42.983
it appears to be some sort of a bird, not in good
health. A lot of the feathers have been pulled or

03:03:42.983 --> 03:03:50.061
plucked from its body and other elements of it are
discolored and dark. As it begins to swoop into a

03:03:50.061 --> 03:03:59.644
dive, you get a sense of the immensity of it.
You're like, "That's a 20-foot-- 30-foot-- that's

03:03:59.644 --> 03:04:10.276
"a 40-foot wingspan, or bigger." At which point,
the bugbears pick up and bolt. They begin running,

03:04:10.276 --> 03:04:16.639
heading eastward in the same direction you were;
they're about 120 feet north of where you are.

03:04:16.639 --> 03:04:21.113
They begin charging in that direction. The rain's
still battering down; you can still make out,

03:04:21.113 --> 03:04:26.797
barely, the shape of it. It swoops down, parallel
to where you guys are, giant talons reach out and

03:04:26.798 --> 03:04:36.008
grasp into one of the bodies and pulls it up. You
hear the bugbear screaming as the talons tear it

03:04:36.008 --> 03:04:42.481
in half in its grasp. As it picks up into the air,
it brings one half of its body up into its beak

03:04:42.481 --> 03:04:50.695
and begin to slurp it down into its large,
sharpened maw. It picks up the other piece of its

03:04:50.695 --> 03:04:55.838
body. It begins to draw and pull out. You see some
of its innards still tangled in the claw, yanked

03:04:55.838 --> 03:05:01.332
out the rest as the legs fall and plummet to the
ground. They keep shouting, "Run! Run!" and

03:05:01.332 --> 03:05:03.361
they're charging. What are you guys doing?

03:05:03.361 --> 03:05:05.367
SAM: Where are they running? To the river?

03:05:05.367 --> 03:05:07.317
MATT: They are running towards the river.

03:05:07.317 --> 03:05:08.747
MARISHA: Let them be the bait.

03:05:08.747 --> 03:05:10.856
SAM: Does the creature see us at all?

03:05:10.856 --> 03:05:12.136
MATT: You don't know.

03:05:12.626 --> 03:05:15.407
LAURA: There's no grass, it's just an open plain?

03:05:15.407 --> 03:05:17.403
MARISHA: Yeah, is there any rock coverage?

03:05:17.864 --> 03:05:26.582
MATT: There's a ways from you right now, maybe 200
feet ahead of you, a little bit of rock. Yes.

03:05:26.583 --> 03:05:34.612
Right now, there are bits of dried-- I want to say
grass, that go about a foot off the ground.

03:05:34.762 --> 03:05:36.449
MARISHA: How far away is the river?

03:05:36.509 --> 03:05:39.199
MATT: The river's probably another three hours of
travel.

03:05:39.199 --> 03:05:42.140
MARISHA: Oh. Oh, okay.

03:05:42.140 --> 03:05:44.886
LAURA: We could lay down and try to hide in the
grass.

03:05:45.127 --> 03:05:47.989
SAM: Sure. Let's do it.

03:05:47.989 --> 03:05:49.646
LAURA: With our cloaks over us?

03:05:49.647 --> 03:05:51.012
MATT: You can certainly try.

03:05:52.836 --> 03:06:03.262
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Major Image and create a
large hairy mastodon and send it in the direction

03:06:03.273 --> 03:06:05.360
of the bugbears, away from us.

03:06:06.401 --> 03:06:10.140
MATT: Okay. What's the DC on that one?

03:06:10.610 --> 03:06:12.266
TRAVIS: Major Image?

03:06:14.033 --> 03:06:18.134
MATT: Oh no, it's not even a saving throw. It has
to try to see if it can discern it. Right, okay.

03:06:18.134 --> 03:06:20.748
TRAVIS: Against your spell save DC, so it's 16.

03:06:21.128 --> 03:06:28.044
MATT: 16? You got it, all right. As it picks up
and they're screaming, it gets up maybe another 80

03:06:28.044 --> 03:06:35.714
or 90 feet off the ground. After picking it up and
coasting above, it climbs another 150 feet or so

03:06:35.714 --> 03:06:46.224
up in the air. Glances down, its head turns
towards the direction of the mastodon that you've

03:06:46.224 --> 03:06:53.893
created, goes into another dive towards it, claws
open. You hear the birdlike shriek as it swoops in

03:06:53.893 --> 03:07:01.483
and passes through this mastodon. Angry, it pulls
back up, its feet skidding into the mud, carving

03:07:01.483 --> 03:07:08.664
these giant grooves into the ground ahead of it.
It rights itself and picks back up and begins to

03:07:08.664 --> 03:07:12.827
turn around to make a second turn towards it. Are
you guys staying put? Are you moving?

03:07:12.827 --> 03:07:15.387
TRAVIS: We are hauling ass, right? No, we're
laying flat.

03:07:15.388 --> 03:07:16.597
LAURA: We're laying flat!

03:07:16.597 --> 03:07:18.482
TRAVIS: Okay, we are laying flat. Sure.

03:07:18.482 --> 03:07:20.584
MATT: Okay. you guys all lay flat.

03:07:20.584 --> 03:07:23.254
LAURA: Yeah, I'm picturing the hobbits in Mordor.

03:07:23.254 --> 03:07:26.686
MATT: You have to roll a new stealth check,
because you did cast a spell.

03:07:26.686 --> 03:07:28.880
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 18?

03:07:28.880 --> 03:07:30.492
LIAM: Plus ten?

03:07:30.493 --> 03:07:32.946
MATT: Well, how long does Pass Without a Trace
last?

03:07:32.946 --> 03:07:36.468
LAURA: Oh yeah, I didn't say I recast it. It lasts
for an hour.

03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:37.714
MATT: Lasts for an hour?

03:07:37.714 --> 03:07:41.736
LAURA: Oh wait, let me check, it might only be ten
minutes. No, I think it's an hour.

03:07:41.736 --> 03:07:43.878
MATT: I think it's an hour too. Double check.

03:07:43.878 --> 03:07:45.074
LAURA: Yeah, its an hour.

03:07:45.074 --> 03:07:48.259
MATT: It's been a few hours. Have you been casting
it along the way?

03:07:48.259 --> 03:07:49.002
LAURA: Yes?

03:07:49.002 --> 03:07:51.459
MATT: How many spell slots do you have
to cast it?

03:07:52.928 --> 03:07:54.616
LAURA: Three.

03:07:54.616 --> 03:07:59.037
MATT: Three? You wouldn't have enough to keep it
at this point, unfortunately. So it is just a

03:07:59.037 --> 03:08:00.612
straight stealth roll for you.

03:08:00.612 --> 03:08:01.505
TRAVIS: 18.

03:08:01.505 --> 03:08:02.490
MATT: Okay.

03:08:02.492 --> 03:08:10.499
SAM: I'll also cast a spell. I'll cast Silent
Image and make another mastodon, running the

03:08:10.499 --> 03:08:11.654
opposite direction.

03:08:11.654 --> 03:08:16.613
MATT: (laughing) Okay. For the rest of you who are
stealthing, because the spell did wear off, I do

03:08:16.613 --> 03:08:20.131
need new stealth checks from everybody to try and
keep away from its sight, and see if its

03:08:20.131 --> 03:08:21.502
distraction maintains itself.

03:08:23.185 --> 03:08:25.180
TALIESIN: Ooh. 18.

03:08:25.921 --> 03:08:27.030
LAURA: 15.

03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:28.166
SAM: 30.

03:08:28.166 --> 03:08:29.006
LIAM: 14.

03:08:29.006 --> 03:08:29.939
MARISHA: 20.

03:08:30.050 --> 03:08:36.914
MATT: Okay. It swoops up. The rest of you jump
down and get low, as far as you can to the ground,

03:08:36.915 --> 03:08:43.657
and getting the rest of the cloak bundled over.
The bugbears keep running. It curves around, sees

03:08:43.657 --> 03:08:53.311
the other mastodon. Does not seem tempted by that
one. That was a natural 20. As it spins back,

03:08:53.311 --> 03:08:58.773
however, still focused on the one, swoops down,
and this time it's going to go into a full

03:08:58.773 --> 03:09:02.900
assault, not trying to pick it up and leave with
it. It's going to come down, claws ready. It

03:09:02.900 --> 03:09:07.252
passes through, its talons slipping into the mud
now. The rain that has been barreling down has

03:09:07.253 --> 03:09:13.429
caused this to become a minor quagmire. It skids
for a second, its massive bird form scooting in

03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:18.721
through, driving this huge wedge into the ground
as it stumbles for a minute and stops. It spins

03:09:18.721 --> 03:09:27.443
around angrily, looking at it. It steps forward
and brings its talon up and bites towards it, and

03:09:27.443 --> 03:09:31.072
it's passing through the mastodon. It's not even
interested in yours.

03:09:31.073 --> 03:09:31.961
SAM: Sure.

03:09:32.211 --> 03:09:36.526
MATT: But it does give time for the bugbears to
continue to escape. You guys are held in place there.

03:09:41.956 --> 03:09:47.115
It does turn and look in your direction a
little bit.

03:09:47.723 --> 03:09:50.556
TRAVIS: I'm going to hold that spell.

03:09:51.196 --> 03:09:56.422
MATT: It just (sniffs). It definitely knows the
mastodon's not real now.

03:09:56.422 --> 03:09:58.754
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. Sure, sure. That's what it says.

03:10:00.964 --> 03:10:04.784
(wings flapping)

03:10:04.784 --> 03:10:12.373
MATT: It takes back off up in the air. Seeing it
now amongst the ground, its wingspan probably fits

03:10:12.373 --> 03:10:18.698
more in the 60-foot tip-to-tip range.

03:10:18.699 --> 03:10:19.596
SAM: Ooh.

03:10:19.596 --> 03:10:22.066
TRAVIS: (laughs) Amazing.

03:10:22.067 --> 03:10:23.470
MARISHA: 747.

03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:32.800
TRAVIS: If it comes close to us, if it looks like
it has spotted us, I'm going to hold a spell.

03:10:38.350 --> 03:10:39.868
LIAM: I'm going to do the same.

03:10:40.467 --> 03:10:43.468
MATT: It swoops around, looks.

03:10:43.468 --> 03:10:45.892
LAURA: I'm going to hold Guiding Bolt, just in
case.

03:10:45.892 --> 03:10:47.517
MARISHA: I'm going to pray.

03:10:48.748 --> 03:10:49.448
MATT: To?

03:10:50.738 --> 03:10:52.010
MARISHA: Ioun, of course.

03:10:52.010 --> 03:11:02.337
MATT: Okay. It takes a moment to pass through the
field, and looks back towards the bugbears, and

03:11:02.337 --> 03:11:04.398
takes off in their direction.

03:11:05.468 --> 03:11:08.127
LAURA: Hey, it's good. Now it's farther from us.

03:11:09.247 --> 03:11:14.457
SAM: Can one of you control it and tell it to fly
us to the town?

03:11:14.458 --> 03:11:16.163
TALIESIN: I can politely ask it.

03:11:16.163 --> 03:11:18.118
TRAVIS: I have Charm Monster.

03:11:18.118 --> 03:11:19.170
LAURA: Oh, you do?

03:11:19.170 --> 03:11:20.169
SAM: You could!

03:11:20.169 --> 03:11:24.628
TRAVIS: Yeah, but if I fail. I get ripped into
pieces! A hundred and something feet in the air!

03:11:24.629 --> 03:11:26.888
LAURA: We would definitely protect you, Fjord.

03:11:26.888 --> 03:11:27.862
TRAVIS: Huh?

03:11:27.862 --> 03:11:29.189
LAURA: We would protect you.

03:11:29.189 --> 03:11:35.418
TRAVIS: Against Rodan? I'm not so sure. What is
that, anyway?

03:11:35.418 --> 03:11:36.249
MATT: It's a roc.

03:11:36.249 --> 03:11:38.108
LIAM: It's a roc, man. From season one?

03:11:38.108 --> 03:11:43.798
MATT: It's not a healthy roc; it's a Xhorhasian
roc. It's a different breed.

03:11:43.798 --> 03:11:45.430
TRAVIS: It's a different kind of roc.

03:11:45.890 --> 03:11:49.566
MARISHA: Alt-roc. Sorry.

03:11:49.567 --> 03:11:51.129
TALIESIN: That was so good!

03:11:51.129 --> 03:11:52.298
MARISHA: That was dumb.

03:11:53.088 --> 03:12:00.179
MATT: The good kind of dumb. You get points for
that. You watch as it takes off in the distance,

03:12:00.179 --> 03:12:10.248
and you can vaguely hear the muffled screams as
this hunting party of bugbears are probably torn

03:12:10.248 --> 03:12:19.346
asunder. It's hard to miss. Its shape dives down a
few times before eventually it takes off back in

03:12:19.346 --> 03:12:25.997
the direction it came and glides overhead: this
massive, airplane-like shadow across the clouded

03:12:25.997 --> 03:12:31.887
sky above you. You all stay still, and it
continues heading back towards the Ashkeeper

03:12:31.888 --> 03:12:36.315
Peaks. You can just barely make out, in its claws
below, one bugbear per claw.

03:12:37.885 --> 03:12:39.489
LAURA: Double-fisting!

03:12:39.489 --> 03:12:41.018
SAM: Those are my people.

03:12:41.018 --> 03:12:41.815
LAURA: What?

03:12:41.815 --> 03:12:43.988
SAM: Nah, I'm just kidding. Fuck those guys.

03:12:44.838 --> 03:12:47.248
LAURA: Who were those? What are those guys?

03:12:47.248 --> 03:12:47.978
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:12:47.978 --> 03:12:50.638
SAM: Do we know what those are?

03:12:50.638 --> 03:12:54.109
TRAVIS: A bugbear? Didn't we fight them in the
first encounter?

03:12:54.109 --> 03:12:54.818
MATT: No.

03:12:54.818 --> 03:12:56.278
TRAVIS: No, those were gnolls.

03:12:56.279 --> 03:13:01.335
MATT: You've never really encountered bugbears per
se, not since you've all been together, but you've

03:13:01.335 --> 03:13:12.420
heard of them. They're cousins to goblinkin.
They're generally more of a bully-- in between the

03:13:12.420 --> 03:13:14.888
ogre and goblin spectrum.

03:13:14.888 --> 03:13:15.715
LAURA: Okay.

03:13:17.038 --> 03:13:26.823
MATT: Yeah, they're physical. They like brutality
and combat, but they're also kind of lazy and like

03:13:26.823 --> 03:13:31.436
to put in as little effort as possible, if they
can make other goblins do it for them, and other

03:13:31.436 --> 03:13:33.339
entities. They're interesting.

03:13:34.272 --> 03:13:38.004
TRAVIS: Probably not terribly well-stocked, not
worth going to where they were picked up from, and--

03:13:38.760 --> 03:13:39.761
MATT: You don't know.

03:13:39.761 --> 03:13:41.384
LAURA: We should maybe just check.

03:13:41.384 --> 03:13:43.341
SAM: How many of the bugbears were there?

03:13:43.341 --> 03:13:44.044
TRAVIS: Four?

03:13:44.044 --> 03:13:45.570
MATT: You saw four in the party.

03:13:45.570 --> 03:13:47.047
SAM: Two, we know, were killed.

03:13:47.048 --> 03:13:47.905
LAURA: Taken away.

03:13:47.905 --> 03:13:49.485
TALIESIN: I think all four were--

03:13:49.485 --> 03:13:50.251
LAURA: Are dead.

03:13:50.251 --> 03:13:54.091
TRAVIS: I think he said they were all
eviscerated, yeah? How far away was

03:13:54.091 --> 03:13:56.697
the first slaughter spot of them from us?

03:13:56.697 --> 03:14:00.509
MATT: From where you guys are right now, it's
about a little over a hundred feet.

03:14:00.509 --> 03:14:03.605
TRAVIS: Maybe we don't need to do that. Maybe we
don't. Cover is--

03:14:03.605 --> 03:14:06.937
TALIESIN: It's going to do nothing but attract
other scavengers anyway.

03:14:06.937 --> 03:14:09.987
LIAM: We were waiting and watching the roc until
it moves on, &lt;i&gt;ja&lt;/i&gt;?

03:14:09.987 --> 03:14:11.467
LAURA: And it has, so let's go.

03:14:11.467 --> 03:14:12.945
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's keep going.

03:14:12.945 --> 03:14:15.277
TALIESIN: How often do you see anything like
that?

03:14:15.277 --> 03:14:16.757
LAURA: That was pretty amazing.

03:14:16.757 --> 03:14:17.797
TRAVIS: Yeah, never.

03:14:19.838 --> 03:14:32.056
MATT: You continue on forward, about 30 minutes of
travel, carefully, slowly. You come upon the

03:14:32.056 --> 03:14:39.350
remnants of the bugbears that were picked up in
the claws. You can see the areas where they were

03:14:39.350 --> 03:14:44.891
scattered a bit, and what was gathered for the
creature to rush off with.

03:14:44.891 --> 03:14:46.190
TRAVIS: Oh, ugh.

03:14:46.191 --> 03:14:47.695
LIAM: That is gruesome.

03:14:48.005 --> 03:14:48.991
LAURA: Zoinks.

03:14:48.991 --> 03:14:55.949
MATT: There is one bugbear that is untouched, it
seems, but still on the ground.

03:14:56.842 --> 03:14:59.144
LAURA: Dead? Or just laying there?

03:14:59.594 --> 03:15:00.754
MATT: It's laying there.

03:15:01.611 --> 03:15:03.053
MARISHA: But playing dead?

03:15:04.575 --> 03:15:06.502
SAM: Let's throw something at it.

03:15:06.502 --> 03:15:13.122
MATT: You get the sense that it is still alive.
You can just, looking over in that direction,

03:15:13.122 --> 03:15:18.511
see the breathing a bit. It looks like it's
been playing dead for a half an hour.

03:15:19.242 --> 03:15:23.673
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I think he's fine. We can keep
moving.

03:15:24.473 --> 03:15:29.842
LAURA: We'll just keep an eye on him as we keep
walking by. I'll use Thaumaturgy and make it sound

03:15:29.842 --> 03:15:31.332
like that bird is coming back.

03:15:31.922 --> 03:15:33.094
MATT: Okay.

03:15:33.292 --> 03:15:34.729
TALIESIN: Wow, that's great.

03:15:34.729 --> 03:15:39.682
SAM: If you want, I can talk to him
if we want any information?

03:15:41.443 --> 03:15:43.313
LAURA: I mean, maybe?

03:15:43.314 --> 03:15:45.496
SAM and TRAVIS: Do we?

03:15:46.806 --> 03:15:49.374
SAM: I don't know, what could we
learn from this thing?

03:15:49.385 --> 03:15:52.871
LIAM: I don't think he is a threat to us, so it
couldn't hurt.

03:15:53.320 --> 03:15:55.237
LAURA: I mean, he might...

03:15:56.201 --> 03:16:00.966
TRAVIS: Are there more of them nearby, where did
you come from, have you seen a giant purple worm?

03:16:00.966 --> 03:16:02.587
LIAM: How do you cross this river?

03:16:02.587 --> 03:16:03.554
SAM: Sure.

03:16:03.554 --> 03:16:04.843
TRAVIS: Where do you cross?

03:16:04.843 --> 03:16:07.240
SAM: Okay. Yeah, let's go chat up the bugbear.

03:16:07.240 --> 03:16:08.474
MATT: Okay.

03:16:08.952 --> 03:16:17.416
SAM: Hello? Sleepy bear? We won't hurt you
if you wake up.

03:16:17.861 --> 03:16:18.990
MATT: No response.

03:16:19.703 --> 03:16:21.274
SAM: We've got a pot of honey.

03:16:21.326 --> 03:16:27.287
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, Huggy Bear, we can see you. Let's
talk. Still have Tongues up, it's an hour.

03:16:27.587 --> 03:16:29.440
LAURA: You guys are speaking in Goblin?

03:16:29.441 --> 03:16:30.151
LIAM: Yeah.

03:16:30.151 --> 03:16:34.709
MATT: Yep. You see one of the eyes kind of creep open.

03:16:35.070 --> 03:16:36.235
TRAVIS: Nap time.

03:16:36.592 --> 03:16:39.140
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;. Peekaboo, we see you.

03:16:39.421 --> 03:16:41.364
SAM: No more hibernate-y.

03:16:44.793 --> 03:16:47.601
MATT: You see the hand go for
the side of its belt.

03:16:47.636 --> 03:16:51.573
SAM: No, no! We mean you no harm. No fight.

03:16:51.573 --> 03:16:54.385
LIAM: We could, but we don't mean to.

03:16:55.675 --> 03:16:57.230
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:16:59.267 --> 03:17:00.375
LIAM: That's cocked.

03:17:00.375 --> 03:17:01.517
MATT: Yeah, it's cocked.

03:17:01.517 --> 03:17:05.717
LAURA: Because you've got so many fucking dice on
your tray! You've got to sort them out.

03:17:05.717 --> 03:17:07.767
LIAM: What the fuck are you talking about?!

03:17:07.767 --> 03:17:10.571
LAURA: You've got to sort them out so you have
room to roll!

03:17:10.571 --> 03:17:13.222
LIAM: I did at the top of the game. Persuasion?
That is a 20.

03:17:13.222 --> 03:17:16.509
SAM: That's true; you have two by three inches of
rolling space there.

03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:20.390
LIAM: That's all you need.

03:17:21.660 --> 03:17:27.575
MATT: The hand that was brushing towards the belt
instead reaches out and plants itself in the mud,

03:17:29.406 --> 03:17:35.741
and then does a push-up into a sitting position,
with the mud all caked into the fur on one side of

03:17:35.741 --> 03:17:45.385
the face. The rest of the fur is matted from the
rain. Sits up. "You mean no harm?"

03:17:46.445 --> 03:17:50.274
SAM: No fighting. Sorry about your friends, or
family.

03:17:53.114 --> 03:17:55.228
MATT: "Well, that is life in the wastes."

03:17:56.714 --> 03:18:02.513
SAM: We're just passing through. We're not trying
to start anything, we just need some directions.

03:18:02.513 --> 03:18:05.439
If you could help us, maybe we can
give you some food.

03:18:05.622 --> 03:18:08.090
LAURA: Ask him if he wants a tattoo.

03:18:09.509 --> 03:18:11.069
SAM: I won't lead with that.

03:18:11.287 --> 03:18:13.752
LIAM: You would want to shave him first?

03:18:13.752 --> 03:18:14.591
LAURA: Sure.

03:18:14.635 --> 03:18:16.170
SAM: Yasha's good at that.

03:18:16.213 --> 03:18:19.744
MATT: He scoots back in the mud and starts
trying to stand up a little bit.

03:18:19.745 --> 03:18:20.705
SAM: No, no.

03:18:20.705 --> 03:18:25.718
LIAM: No, we are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to hurt you. We
could, really, just destroy you, but we have no

03:18:25.719 --> 03:18:30.661
desire to do that. We just want some information,
because you live here and we want to pass. You see

03:18:30.661 --> 03:18:33.724
that river over there? We are hoping to get to the
other side of it.

03:18:33.724 --> 03:18:35.645
MATT: "I don't live here."

03:18:35.645 --> 03:18:36.965
LIAM: Where do you live?

03:18:36.965 --> 03:18:41.703
MATT: "There," and points in the direction, past
the river but a little bit northeast.

03:18:41.703 --> 03:18:45.939
SAM: Oh! How do you get to the-- do you live on
the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; side of the river?

03:18:45.939 --> 03:18:46.977
MATT: "Yeah."

03:18:47.047 --> 03:18:48.910
SAM: How do you get to the other side of the
river?

03:18:49.340 --> 03:18:50.073
MATT: "Swim."

03:18:51.603 --> 03:18:53.370
SAM: Is it a hard swim?

03:18:53.570 --> 03:18:54.353
MATT: "Yeah."

03:18:55.333 --> 03:18:56.774
TRAVIS: This guy is valuable!

03:18:56.774 --> 03:18:58.579
SAM: Do you think we could do it, or no?

03:19:00.079 --> 03:19:01.164
MATT: "Maybe."

03:19:01.605 --> 03:19:02.930
TRAVIS: Maybe!

03:19:03.291 --> 03:19:07.524
LIAM: I see that look in your eye. Is there a best
place to cross the river, that you use?

03:19:07.524 --> 03:19:12.297
SAM: Yeah, a place where it, I guess,
widens out, so it'd be less--

03:19:12.298 --> 03:19:13.518
LAURA: No, no.

03:19:13.518 --> 03:19:15.097
TRAVIS: Shallow, more shallow.

03:19:15.097 --> 03:19:16.269
LAURA: More shallow.

03:19:16.269 --> 03:19:18.319
SAM: Shallow? I don't know how water works.

03:19:18.319 --> 03:19:19.484
TALIESIN: That's true.

03:19:19.485 --> 03:19:23.849
MATT: "There are a few places where the
river's not quite as bad, yes."

03:19:23.849 --> 03:19:24.631
LIAM: Well?

03:19:24.631 --> 03:19:27.512
SAM: Where are those places? We have food!

03:19:27.513 --> 03:19:31.848
TALIESIN: I was going to say, if you can show us
where that is and we can get across, once--

03:19:31.848 --> 03:19:33.330
LAURA: He can't understand you.

03:19:33.330 --> 03:19:35.329
TALIESIN: Well, yeah, but I can say this--

03:19:35.329 --> 03:19:37.095
SAM: Is what I translate to him, yes.

03:19:37.095 --> 03:19:38.052
TALIESIN: We could--

03:19:38.052 --> 03:19:40.953
MATT: Actually, he turns to you and
responds in broken Common.

03:19:40.953 --> 03:19:41.751
LAURA: Oh, shit.

03:19:41.751 --> 03:19:46.341
TALIESIN: Well, that's convenient. If you can help
us get across, I can give you some food, and if

03:19:46.341 --> 03:19:48.808
you need any healing after what just happened.

03:19:48.808 --> 03:19:49.948
LAURA: And a tattoo!

03:19:50.178 --> 03:19:51.843
TALIESIN: The tattoo's optional.

03:19:51.844 --> 03:19:53.054
LAURA: It's pretty cool.

03:19:53.054 --> 03:19:55.389
TALIESIN: They are pretty cool, but it's
optional.

03:19:58.209 --> 03:20:02.350
MATT: "I can show you across the river. But--"

03:20:03.454 --> 03:20:06.312
MARISHA: Can I ride you across the river?

03:20:06.682 --> 03:20:08.359
TALIESIN: Are we making this weird?

03:20:08.359 --> 03:20:11.566
MARISHA: Do you float, can I ride like a raft?

03:20:11.566 --> 03:20:15.054
MATT: "I can float, yes."

03:20:16.084 --> 03:20:19.350
MARISHA: Have you ever ridden a person
across the river?

03:20:19.350 --> 03:20:20.207
TRAVIS: Have you?

03:20:20.207 --> 03:20:23.158
MATT: "Not since I was a tiny bear, but--"

03:20:23.158 --> 03:20:24.824
MARISHA: What? You have a bad back?

03:20:24.825 --> 03:20:31.754
SAM: No, he said not since he was a tiny bugbear.
This feels like a "Scorpion and the Tortoise" sort

03:20:31.754 --> 03:20:34.201
of thing, but are you the scorpion?

03:20:34.201 --> 03:20:35.817
MARISHA: I'm always the scorpion.

03:20:35.817 --> 03:20:37.995
MATT: "You're not from around here, are you?"

03:20:38.245 --> 03:20:39.074
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:20:39.504 --> 03:20:41.350
MARISHA: Do we look like tourists?

03:20:41.460 --> 03:20:42.510
MATT: "Very much."

03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:43.900
LAURA: Is it our fanny packs?

03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:46.135
MARISHA: Is it our matching cloaks?

03:20:46.135 --> 03:20:47.917
MATT: "The bright pink one you wear around your
waist?"

03:20:49.977 --> 03:20:54.761
MARISHA: We do have "Xhorhas or bust" on the back
of our cloaks, that might give it away.

03:20:54.761 --> 03:20:56.731
SAM: What is your name?

03:20:57.121 --> 03:20:58.554
MATT: "My name is Gluzzo."

03:20:58.825 --> 03:20:59.850
SAM: Bluza?

03:20:59.900 --> 03:21:01.065
MATT: "Gluzzo."

03:21:01.225 --> 03:21:02.435
ALL: Gluzzo.

03:21:03.095 --> 03:21:09.965
LIAM: So this big bird that has killed your
friends, your family: are there a lot of those?

03:21:11.005 --> 03:21:18.232
MATT: "Not usually this far out from the
mountains. There's some that are to the eastern

03:21:18.232 --> 03:21:23.724
"range, by the Penumbra Range, and there's
some at the Ashkeepers."

03:21:23.754 --> 03:21:27.025
LIAM: So they become less of an issue in your neck
of the woods, &lt;i&gt;ja&lt;/i&gt;?

03:21:27.025 --> 03:21:33.725
MATT: "Yeah. They don't go too far into the
valley, but we were trying to go further in."

03:21:34.066 --> 03:21:34.954
LAURA: Why?

03:21:35.534 --> 03:21:42.463
MATT: "They're paying us to. Well, they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt;
paying us to bring food back for the armies."

03:21:43.923 --> 03:21:44.625
LAURA: Oh.

03:21:44.625 --> 03:21:46.321
LIAM: You've been hired by--

03:21:46.321 --> 03:21:47.276
TRAVIS: The Empire?

03:21:47.276 --> 03:21:48.175
LIAM: No.

03:21:48.175 --> 03:21:49.445
LAURA: The bad guys.

03:21:49.445 --> 03:21:50.270
TRAVIS: The Kryn.

03:21:50.270 --> 03:21:51.971
LIAM: No. The Kryn?

03:21:51.971 --> 03:21:53.735
MATT: "Dynasty, yes."

03:21:53.736 --> 03:21:54.495
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja.&lt;/i&gt;

03:21:54.495 --> 03:21:55.710
MARISHA: The Dynasty.

03:21:55.710 --> 03:21:56.767
MATT: "They--"

03:21:57.687 --> 03:21:59.287
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, the Kryn Dynasty.

03:21:59.287 --> 03:22:05.107
MATT: He catches himself. There's a look of
mistrust across his face. This may not be the most

03:22:05.107 --> 03:22:07.405
intelligent creature, but suddenly, he's like...

03:22:07.405 --> 03:22:11.227
SAM: Give him food, give him something. Do we have
something? Give him something.

03:22:11.227 --> 03:22:13.880
LAURA: Yeah, here's some of the food I took from
the guys. Here.

03:22:13.880 --> 03:22:15.381
SAM: You can trust us.

03:22:18.446 --> 03:22:20.362
LAURA: Do you like this? Rations?

03:22:20.715 --> 03:22:27.765
MATT: The bugbear's probably close to Caduceus'
size, though it's sitting. It doesn't look as big

03:22:27.765 --> 03:22:33.033
at this point, but as it reaches out and grabs it,
its big, furred, clawed hand completely envelops

03:22:33.033 --> 03:22:37.053
yours and pulls the food out. It almost scratches
the palm a little bit.

03:22:37.053 --> 03:22:40.907
LAURA: Ow. Like one of those kangaroos when you
feed them and they go (errk).

03:22:40.907 --> 03:22:42.228
TRAVIS: They got big-ass claws on them.

03:22:42.228 --> 03:22:52.887
MATT: (loud chewing and smacking) "So are you
going to kill me, or are you going to let me go,

03:22:52.887 --> 03:22:56.170
"or am I going to my city? What do you
want from me?"

03:22:56.170 --> 03:22:58.789
LAURA: We just want you to help us
get across the river.

03:22:58.789 --> 03:23:01.736
SAM: And to your city, if your city is eastward?

03:23:01.978 --> 03:23:04.377
MARISHA: I'm really curious of how buoyant
you are.

03:23:05.185 --> 03:23:06.255
MATT: "I live in the--"

03:23:06.465 --> 03:23:11.049
LAURA: No, he's not from-- Are you from Ghor
Dranas?

03:23:11.399 --> 03:23:13.555
MATT: "No, no. I'm from Asarius."

03:23:14.592 --> 03:23:18.916
LIAM: How far off from Ghor Dranas is that, do you
know?

03:23:19.411 --> 03:23:28.207
MATT: "It's on the way. Sort of. I've not been to
Ghor Dranas. Asarius is the City of Beasts."

03:23:28.907 --> 03:23:29.697
LAURA: Whoa.

03:23:29.698 --> 03:23:31.067
LIAM: City of Beasts.

03:23:35.997 --> 03:23:39.738
MATT: "The guy that hired us isn't the nicest, but
he pays well."

03:23:40.203 --> 03:23:41.743
SAM: What did he hire you to do?

03:23:42.294 --> 03:23:44.020
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Gather food.

03:23:45.220 --> 03:23:55.060
MATT: "It's a meat and feed company. It's run by a
super smart ogre man, Baron Visco. Kind of a douche."

03:23:55.903 --> 03:23:57.081
TRAVIS: Baron Visco?

03:24:03.068 --> 03:24:09.241
LIAM: Well, Gluzzo, can you lead us, you think? We
have more food we can share with you. Can you lead

03:24:09.241 --> 03:24:12.545
us to the safest place to cross your river?

03:24:13.616 --> 03:24:23.035
MATT: "I'll show you. Come on." He gets up and
stands. Now, seeing him close up, it's

03:24:23.035 --> 03:24:32.395
interesting: wide shoulders, but rail-thin,
furred, gaunt body. You can't tell because of the

03:24:32.395 --> 03:24:38.881
fur if it's malnourished or it's just designed to
be a runner, and is just a very thin, muscular

03:24:38.881 --> 03:24:43.774
frame. Gathered by the fact it was a hunting party
that wasn't expecting a roc, they're probably used

03:24:43.774 --> 03:24:48.082
to running and hunting out in these open fields
fairly often. So hard to tell one way or the

03:24:48.082 --> 03:24:56.781
other. Gluzzo continues to walk forward and keeps
checking over his shoulder towards you, with a

03:24:56.781 --> 03:25:03.791
look of waiting for the moment when someone shoots
him in the base of the skull. He keeps walking,

03:25:03.791 --> 03:25:06.375
and keeps walking. Do you guys follow?

03:25:06.375 --> 03:25:07.416
ALL: Yeah.

03:25:07.446 --> 03:25:08.096
MATT: Okay.

03:25:08.338 --> 03:25:10.619
LAURA: But keeping an eye out in case we get
ambushed.

03:25:12.489 --> 03:25:14.088
TALIESIN: He seems all right, though?

03:25:15.418 --> 03:25:20.453
MATT: He seems to be in a position where he
doesn't have a choice; and just watched his

03:25:20.453 --> 03:25:23.214
hunting party get demolished.

03:25:23.214 --> 03:25:25.487
TALIESIN: All right. He's not thinking about
anything funny, though.

03:25:26.097 --> 03:25:27.476
MATT: Make an insight check.

03:25:33.167 --> 03:25:33.990
TALIESIN: 24.

03:25:35.950 --> 03:25:43.068
MATT: At the moment, seems less interested in trying
to cross you and just survive and get back home.

03:25:44.298 --> 03:25:45.116
TRAVIS: Smart.

03:25:48.796 --> 03:25:53.093
TALIESIN: Well, when we find the place, we can all
help each other cross the river, go our separate

03:25:53.093 --> 03:25:56.598
ways. Fill your belly, at least, before you go.

03:25:59.926 --> 03:26:07.810
MATT: Continues on, quietly. A few hours of travel
in the heavy rain, you begin to come upon the

03:26:07.810 --> 03:26:18.065
river itself. The banks are extremely muddy, with
a black, deep brown, bits of red mud to it, and

03:26:18.066 --> 03:26:24.455
even a hundred feet out from the bank the typical
muddy walk you've had here through the wastes

03:26:24.455 --> 03:26:29.554
becomes very (sucking squelching). You find your
boots being tugged at and almost pulled off at

03:26:29.554 --> 03:26:35.783
times, and as you get right up towards the river,
it's not a &lt;i&gt;rushing&lt;/i&gt; river, but it is moving with

03:26:35.783 --> 03:26:47.643
expediency, especially with the recent rains. The
mud sinks up to mid-calf with each step. Gluzzo

03:26:47.643 --> 03:26:54.312
begins to walk along the sides, trying to remember
which point is the best for entry. At times, the

03:26:54.312 --> 03:27:02.838
river's between anywhere from 30 to 50 feet wide,
so it's a fairly wide river. At some points, it

03:27:02.838 --> 03:27:09.163
pushes into the 20-25 and that's where Gluzzo leads
you to that section and goes, "This is probably

03:27:09.164 --> 03:27:14.566
"the best place in the region. We can go further
south if you want, but this could work."

03:27:16.164 --> 03:27:19.454
SAM: Will you go first, or should we go first?

03:27:19.854 --> 03:27:23.444
MATT: "I can go first if you-- I'm going there
anyway."

03:27:25.389 --> 03:27:26.795
TALIESIN: You can also--

03:27:26.796 --> 03:27:29.838
SAM: I'll be fine, but do you guys want to tie a
rope around this fellow?

03:27:29.838 --> 03:27:34.407
TALIESIN: I was going to say, we can tie a rope
around you and then you could secure at the other

03:27:34.407 --> 03:27:35.206
side of the--

03:27:35.206 --> 03:27:37.064
LIAM: It would be easier to get across.

03:27:37.064 --> 03:27:38.404
SAM: Oh, yeah. I'll do that.

03:27:39.614 --> 03:27:43.025
TRAVIS: There's also several of us that can, you
know, mess with water.

03:27:43.185 --> 03:27:48.996
SAM: Ah. Fjord, that's your very special power
that only you have.

03:27:49.164 --> 03:27:54.204
LAURA: Honestly, I don't have it prepared, Fjord,
so you are very special right now.

03:27:54.204 --> 03:27:55.235
TRAVIS: I hate her.

03:27:56.505 --> 03:27:59.483
TALIESIN: We can make a rope tether, though, if we
have to.

03:28:00.874 --> 03:28:05.327
SAM: Would you like to use your very special
power, or should I just carry a rope across?

03:28:07.328 --> 03:28:08.377
TRAVIS: I kill Nott.

03:28:08.377 --> 03:28:11.731
(laughter)

03:28:13.229 --> 03:28:19.447
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
Gluzzo seems to have dropped onto his knees and

03:28:19.447 --> 03:28:22.992
bowed his head quietly for a moment and is holding
something in his hand.

03:28:23.092 --> 03:28:25.226
LAURA: What's going on? Are you praying?

03:28:26.324 --> 03:28:33.849
MATT: He stays quiet for a minute. Opens his eyes
again and you see glimmers of a chain lost in fur

03:28:33.849 --> 03:28:35.695
as he tucks something under his fur.

03:28:35.695 --> 03:28:36.865
LAURA: Is he naked?

03:28:37.145 --> 03:28:49.632
MATT: You can see a breastplate and some bracers
and some boots-- actually, no boots on him.

03:28:49.632 --> 03:28:55.124
Just his large, furred feet. Mostly lower-half
naked; but it's mostly fur in the area.

03:28:55.124 --> 03:28:56.744
LAURA and MARISHA: He's shirt cocking?

03:28:59.314 --> 03:29:02.094
MATT: Armor cocking, technically.

03:29:03.074 --> 03:29:07.485
LIAM: And he just hid the medallion in his own
Robert Guccione mass of chest hair?

03:29:07.485 --> 03:29:08.313
MATT: Yes.

03:29:08.313 --> 03:29:09.170
LIAM: Okay.

03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:12.016
LAURA: Who were you praying to?

03:29:12.236 --> 03:29:13.366
MATT: "To the Light."

03:29:13.746 --> 03:29:14.557
SAM: Who?

03:29:14.888 --> 03:29:16.005
MARISHA: Goliath?

03:29:16.005 --> 03:29:17.002
MATT: "The Light."

03:29:17.003 --> 03:29:18.655
LAURA, SAM, and MARISHA: The Light.

03:29:19.875 --> 03:29:26.195
MATT: Stands up and begins to wade out into the
water. He's swimming and fighting the stream.

03:29:28.959 --> 03:29:31.289
LAURA: Go, Nott. Unless Fjord--?

03:29:31.293 --> 03:29:34.962
SAM: I'm going to tag along. Fjord, do you want to
do anything?

03:29:35.892 --> 03:29:36.815
TRAVIS: Not me.

03:29:36.815 --> 03:29:41.291
TALIESIN: I've got the rope. I'm holding one end of
the rope if you're going to hold the other.

03:29:41.291 --> 03:29:42.060
LAURA: Yeah, go.

03:29:42.060 --> 03:29:43.824
SAM: Okay. I'll take the rope across.

03:29:43.825 --> 03:29:51.943
MATT: Okay. Gluzzo, surprisingly strong. Fights the
current; even though it moves along, he manages to

03:29:51.943 --> 03:29:59.286
still make his way across. Big armfuls of water,
breaststroke style. He makes it across at an angle

03:29:59.286 --> 03:30:02.950
and eventually stands up amongst the muck on the
opposite end.

03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:05.488
TALIESIN: Let's tack them down if we can.

03:30:05.488 --> 03:30:07.753
LAURA: Yes, is there anything to tie off the--

03:30:07.754 --> 03:30:10.858
TALIESIN: Don't we have some spikes?

03:30:10.858 --> 03:30:13.154
LAURA: In the mud? I think it would come undone.

03:30:13.154 --> 03:30:17.810
MATT: In the immediate vicinity, there's nothing
to really tie it to. What few rocks are there are,

03:30:17.810 --> 03:30:21.232
are small enough to the point that it would just
be pulled out with any--

03:30:21.232 --> 03:30:25.465
TALIESIN: Well, at the very least we can have
strong people hold the ropes on either side.

03:30:25.465 --> 03:30:28.078
LAURA: Maybe Gluzzo can hold the rope
on the other side.

03:30:28.078 --> 03:30:32.354
SAM: I don't know how this works, but I'm going
to try to walk across the super-fast-moving

03:30:32.354 --> 03:30:33.538
current of water.

03:30:33.909 --> 03:30:41.623
MATT: And you do. You run across; and as you do,
it's like running sideways on the moving pathways

03:30:41.623 --> 03:30:48.740
in an airport. Moving forward, but you're watching
your entire perspective shift down that way. It

03:30:48.740 --> 03:30:54.521
gets a bit bumpy at times as your feet hit where
parts of the water are cresting and hitting stones

03:30:54.521 --> 03:30:59.043
or whitewater is starting to splash, so it's a little
uneven. It's an interesting sensation, but

03:30:59.043 --> 03:31:00.287
eventually you run across.

03:31:00.287 --> 03:31:01.447
SAM: Hey, made it.

03:31:01.567 --> 03:31:03.920
MATT: Gluzzo is on the other side like, (whew).

03:31:05.100 --> 03:31:09.848
SAM: Gluzzo, do you mind holding this end of the
rope so that my friends can join us?

03:31:12.498 --> 03:31:17.380
MATT: Grabs the end of the rope and wraps it
around the forearm and holds it there.

03:31:18.608 --> 03:31:21.265
SAM: All right everyone. Come across!

03:31:21.265 --> 03:31:25.996
TRAVIS: Good job, Nott! I'll use Control Water to
part the river for a hundred feet in either

03:31:25.996 --> 03:31:32.047
direction and create a nice line of dry land to the other
side.

03:31:34.708 --> 03:31:41.034
MATT: All right. You watch as the river parts and
halts itself there. The flow of the river suspended

03:31:41.034 --> 03:31:48.605
for the time being and you can now see the muddy
walkway that is the base of the river. Dozens and

03:31:48.605 --> 03:31:53.905
dozens of smooth river stones cluster in the bottom
and you can see protruding roots of other leaves

03:31:53.906 --> 03:31:58.187
and bushes that were washed in and sunk down
and stuck in the muck, but it is traversable.

03:31:58.187 --> 03:32:01.573
TALIESIN: Are there any particularly attractive
river stones down there?

03:32:01.573 --> 03:32:02.525
MATT: There's a few.

03:32:02.525 --> 03:32:05.287
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick a couple up when I
walk across.

03:32:05.287 --> 03:32:07.717
MATT: You gather a couple of
pretty river stones.

03:32:07.717 --> 03:32:09.858
LIAM: How much time do we have to cross this?

03:32:09.858 --> 03:32:10.818
TRAVIS: Ten minutes.

03:32:10.818 --> 03:32:13.010
LIAM: That's good. I'm going to start walking.

03:32:13.301 --> 03:32:14.530
TRAVIS: Ten long minutes.

03:32:14.811 --> 03:32:18.705
SAM: Keep going, everyone! I'm here in case his
magic fails.

03:32:19.696 --> 03:32:24.548
MATT: You guys all make your way across and Gluzzo
sits there staring at you, Nott, looks at the rope

03:32:24.548 --> 03:32:27.367
and goes, "Do I have to keep holding onto this?"

03:32:27.367 --> 03:32:36.595
SAM: No, it was just a back up. Our leader, Caleb, made
sure that Fjord controlled the water so we're okay.

03:32:36.595 --> 03:32:40.457
LIAM: Caleb, to humor Nott, has used the rope the
whole way, walking along.

03:32:40.458 --> 03:32:42.367
SAM: Thank you so much.

03:32:43.287 --> 03:32:47.665
TALIESIN: I also think I'm going to poke my head
in the river in one of the walls just to see

03:32:47.665 --> 03:32:49.628
what's happening on the other side of it.

03:32:49.628 --> 03:32:51.399
MATT: Okay. Roll-- no, I'm kidding.

03:32:51.399 --> 03:32:53.470
TRAVIS: (splashing) Really?!

03:32:55.880 --> 03:33:08.889
MATT: It's very cold water. It is murky, but not
unpleasant. You glance in and you think you catch

03:33:09.101 --> 03:33:15.019
a glimmer of what might have been a fish swimming
along in it, but there's so little light here

03:33:15.019 --> 03:33:19.750
amongst the darkened clouds and the storm above
that you see it and it's gone and you're not even

03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:21.759
sure if your brain made it up.

03:33:22.087 --> 03:33:24.057
TALIESIN: That's great. All right, fair enough.

03:33:24.268 --> 03:33:29.918
MATT: You make your way across the river. Gluzzo
tosses the rope back to you and turns around and

03:33:29.918 --> 03:33:40.015
starts making the walk continuously. There's
unique balance between wanting to help to survive

03:33:40.015 --> 03:33:45.016
and not be killed by you, and also seemingly really put
out by anything you ask him to do.

03:33:45.016 --> 03:33:48.496
SAM: This is a common refrain from anyone we've
ever met.

03:33:50.766 --> 03:33:54.259
MATT: Yeah, but usually you've earned it. This is
right off the bat.

03:33:54.600 --> 03:33:57.222
TALIESIN: I feel like we owe him a bag of food
at least.

03:33:57.222 --> 03:33:59.990
LIAM: Yeah, can we give him some more?
Or give him a taste?

03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:02.277
TALIESIN: We'll give him one of the ration kits.

03:34:02.277 --> 03:34:06.675
LIAM: This is how you know we are not going to
kill you, because we would not be dumping our food

03:34:06.675 --> 03:34:09.990
into you before we-- we're not fattening you up
for-- you know.

03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:12.306
TALIESIN: I feel like you really let that trail
on.

03:34:13.107 --> 03:34:15.843
LAURA: Are we just going to let him go, then?

03:34:15.844 --> 03:34:17.211
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:23.768
SAM: How much further is Ghor Dranas?
How many days' walk?

03:34:25.299 --> 03:34:41.710
MATT: "Ghor Dranas from here? From Asarius is
maybe, at a pretty fast speed, about two weeks?"

03:34:42.563 --> 03:34:43.517
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

03:34:43.841 --> 03:34:47.274
SAM: Are there any beasts of burden that we could
rent?

03:34:48.449 --> 03:34:50.331
MATT: "Maybe in Asarius."

03:34:50.561 --> 03:34:52.291
SAM: Maybe we should make a stop.

03:34:52.291 --> 03:34:55.849
LAURA: Do you think if we go there, people are
going to kill us right away?

03:34:55.850 --> 03:34:57.100
LIAM: That's a fair bet.

03:34:57.260 --> 03:34:59.481
TRAVIS: You said a city of beasts, didn't you?

03:35:00.101 --> 03:35:03.885
MATT: "Yes. Well, are you with the Empire?"

03:35:03.885 --> 03:35:05.227
SAM and LAURA: No.

03:35:05.227 --> 03:35:06.726
TALIESIN: Mostly unaffiliated.

03:35:07.136 --> 03:35:11.649
LAURA: No. We're just hanging out. We like it
here.

03:35:11.649 --> 03:35:22.279
MATT: "(sighs) I mean, you would probably be okay.
You'll probably be okay. You'll probably be okay."

03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:24.054
SAM: What about the tall woman?

03:35:24.054 --> 03:35:35.622
MATT: "You might be okay." Looks to Yasha, Beau,
and Caduceus. "We do have humans that do come

03:35:35.622 --> 03:35:43.374
"through, but they're usually-- well, they're
pretty well-connected with the Dynasty."

03:35:45.188 --> 03:35:47.515
TRAVIS: We are totally going into this city now.

03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:53.648
SAM: We can do some crafty disguises.

03:35:53.648 --> 03:36:02.250
MARISHA: I don't know. You can do the crafty
disguise on yourself, right, Nott?

03:36:02.250 --> 03:36:04.669
SAM: I can, yes, but I won't need to.

03:36:06.129 --> 03:36:09.935
MARISHA: Can I borrow your armor? Your glamour?

03:36:09.935 --> 03:36:12.518
SAM: It'll change what you're wearing.

03:36:14.728 --> 03:36:20.327
LIAM: That's a start, you could make some of that
insect-like armor, hmm?

03:36:21.423 --> 03:36:23.380
MARISHA: The glamour armor?

03:36:23.380 --> 03:36:25.630
SAM: You could change what it looks like.

03:36:25.630 --> 03:36:28.055
LAURA and MARISHA: Just the clothes.

03:36:28.056 --> 03:36:32.631
LIAM: Have you used it to put a hat on yourself?
Could you make one of those insect-like helmets?

03:36:32.636 --> 03:36:34.056
SAM: I have not tried that.

03:36:34.056 --> 03:36:35.789
LAURA: Or any helmet, really.

03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:43.954
SAM: We could-- hmm, nope. Caleb can
disguise himself.

03:36:46.114 --> 03:36:48.662
MARISHA: So can literally everybody else
in our party.

03:36:48.662 --> 03:36:52.321
LAURA: No, I pull out that ugly mask that I
bought. You could put this on!

03:36:52.478 --> 03:36:53.985
SAM: What's that? What is it?

03:36:53.985 --> 03:36:55.968
LAURA: The mask that I bought, remember?

03:36:56.818 --> 03:37:05.447
MATT: It's a metallic, angry, monster scowl mask.

03:37:05.448 --> 03:37:07.149
MARISHA: No, this feels weird.

03:37:07.149 --> 03:37:09.529
LAURA: Hey! Would that look like it
fits in better?

03:37:11.270 --> 03:37:23.010
MATT: "Maybe a little bit. I mean, I'm going to be
honest. We're in a wartime, so if they're not

03:37:23.010 --> 03:37:28.821
"familiar with you, and you don't convince them
well, probably going to kill you."

03:37:28.821 --> 03:37:31.682
SAM: But we're with you! And you'll vouch for us.

03:37:31.683 --> 03:37:36.103
TRAVIS: Also, we don't all need to go into the
city if we're just acquiring transport, right?

03:37:36.483 --> 03:37:38.778
SAM: That's true. We could just send in a party.

03:37:38.978 --> 03:37:41.682
LIAM: How far off is your city? This City of
Beasts.

03:37:45.091 --> 03:37:54.572
MATT: "It could go partway into the night and maybe
get there a little after halfway through the night.

03:37:54.572 --> 03:37:57.270
"Otherwise, tomorrow morning."

03:37:57.650 --> 03:38:03.871
LIAM: That's not too long. I don't know if I like
the idea of diverting just to get some creatures

03:38:03.871 --> 03:38:05.633
to ride, but that is not long at all.

03:38:05.831 --> 03:38:09.071
TRAVIS: I don't think it's too bad.
We should do it.

03:38:09.684 --> 03:38:12.666
SAM: So some of us go into town and try to get a
wagon.

03:38:12.666 --> 03:38:14.938
TRAVIS: The rest will stay just outside.

03:38:14.938 --> 03:38:20.486
LAURA: Okay, but I'm going to point out the fact
that those other people that we talked to that

03:38:20.486 --> 03:38:29.108
were definitely also not with the Empire totally
said that the best way to travel was on foot

03:38:29.108 --> 03:38:32.795
because if you were on any kind of animal, you
would attract more attention.

03:38:32.795 --> 03:38:33.987
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:38:33.987 --> 03:38:38.643
SAM: Is that true? Is riding something bad news
around here?

03:38:39.233 --> 03:38:42.162
LAURA: I mean, it'll be easier to see us.

03:38:43.342 --> 03:38:50.037
MATT: "If you can go faster than what you're
trying to avoid, you might be okay, but otherwise,

03:38:50.037 --> 03:38:56.259
"you know." He points back towards where the roc
was.

03:38:57.948 --> 03:38:59.298
TALIESIN: Roc's pretty fast.

03:39:00.899 --> 03:39:05.439
MATT: "But the rocs don't usually come this close
to center of the valley."

03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:06.680
LAURA: That's true.

03:39:06.680 --> 03:39:11.209
TRAVIS: We're talking about two weeks on foot,
though, and we're going to be walking forever.

03:39:11.209 --> 03:39:12.644
SAM: Let's get some horses.

03:39:12.644 --> 03:39:17.269
TRAVIS: At least we'll get into the city. If there
aren't any horses or anything that makes sense,

03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:23.630
then we'll skip it. No carts. None of that shit.
Lead on. We'll stop short. You don't need to walk

03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:27.641
us into your own city. Just get us close to
the outskirts. That would be good enough.

03:39:28.231 --> 03:39:29.730
MATT: "Do you have any money?"

03:39:29.730 --> 03:39:32.389
MARISHA: I was about to ask that. What currency?

03:39:34.489 --> 03:39:41.908
MATT: "It's somewhat bartering, but gold is always
useful. There is trade that is done outside of Xhorhas."

03:39:43.247 --> 03:39:44.948
TALIESIN: We have lots of things.

03:39:44.949 --> 03:39:46.125
TRAVIS: We have gold.

03:39:46.125 --> 03:39:53.807
MATT: "Gold, I think, is useful to the Kryn, so
could you help me with some gold?"

03:39:53.807 --> 03:39:55.463
SAM: Oh yeah. Sure.

03:39:55.463 --> 03:39:57.181
TRAVIS: Here, I'll flick him a gold.

03:39:57.684 --> 03:39:58.604
SAM: A gold.

03:39:58.604 --> 03:39:59.492
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:40:00.533 --> 03:40:01.360
SAM: &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; gold.

03:40:01.363 --> 03:40:03.048
TRAVIS: If you get us there, might be more of
that.

03:40:04.523 --> 03:40:05.498
MATT: "Okay."

03:40:05.627 --> 03:40:13.849
LAURA: I'll give him &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; gold as well. If you want
a tattoo, I'll give you another.

03:40:19.519 --> 03:40:20.355
MATT: "Okay."

03:40:20.355 --> 03:40:23.937
(laughter)

03:40:23.937 --> 03:40:27.426
LAURA: Sweet. I'm going to shave--

03:40:27.426 --> 03:40:30.186
LIAM, TRAVIS, and SAM: Yasha.

03:40:30.186 --> 03:40:33.996
TALIESIN: Let's do this when we camp. You can,
once we set up camp.

03:40:35.676 --> 03:40:40.475
LIAM: Serious Skyrim Jarl vibes from this
bugbear.

03:40:43.165 --> 03:40:46.924
MATT: Don't get this dialect too often
outside of Skyrim these days.

03:40:49.064 --> 03:40:52.604
Are you pressing through the night or
are you bedding down for the evening?

03:40:52.604 --> 03:40:57.025
TRAVIS: We're bedding down for the evening, but
it depends on the terrain outside of the city.

03:40:57.035 --> 03:40:58.633
If it's more flat plains, then--

03:40:58.633 --> 03:41:00.785
MATT: It's all flat plains here, man.

03:41:01.165 --> 03:41:06.312
TRAVIS: We'll stop well shy of the city then. As
soon as it's just barely visible, we'll stop out there.

03:41:06.490 --> 03:41:15.039
MATT: Okay. As nightfall hits and a few more hours
pushing on, the weather, the exhaustion, it all

03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:20.201
starts to get to you and you feel the need to bed
down pretty soon without pushing yourself beyond

03:41:20.201 --> 03:41:33.582
a comfortable boundary. You begin to set up your
space, and Gluzzo rakes a bit of the ground open

03:41:33.582 --> 03:41:40.681
and creates a small sleeping convex hole
to curl into.

03:41:40.691 --> 03:41:42.042
MARISHA: That's so cute.

03:41:47.432 --> 03:41:49.920
MATT: But nevertheless, you bed down
for the evening.

03:41:49.920 --> 03:41:54.248
LIAM: I feel like I should pop the dome around him
so that when we stay up to watch, he's not going

03:41:54.248 --> 03:41:56.055
to run off in the middle of the night.

03:41:56.055 --> 03:42:03.268
SAM: We are so trusting. Look at us! We meet
friends wherever we go. We met a monster and

03:42:03.268 --> 03:42:05.519
made him our friend. We're good people.

03:42:07.439 --> 03:42:10.717
MARISHA: Are you trying to convince us or you?

03:42:10.717 --> 03:42:14.967
SAM: No! I'm just saying we should take a moment
to realize people like us.

03:42:15.947 --> 03:42:19.037
TALIESIN: I'm proud of you, if that helps.
I'm proud of everybody.

03:42:19.037 --> 03:42:23.374
MARISHA: We might have been partially responsible
for getting all the Muck Men killed, but--

03:42:24.294 --> 03:42:25.978
LAURA: (shushing)

03:42:25.978 --> 03:42:29.846
TRAVIS: Well, we kept more of them from
getting killed, I think is also important.

03:42:30.576 --> 03:42:32.908
Jester, what do you need to complete this tattoo?

03:42:33.828 --> 03:42:38.607
LAURA: Just him shaved. That is it. Where
would you like a tattoo, sir?

03:42:39.477 --> 03:42:40.969
MATT: Looks around his body.

03:42:41.149 --> 03:42:42.368
MARISHA: Go for the neck.

03:42:42.369 --> 03:42:50.261
LAURA: Remember, you will be bald there for some
time. Somewhere that the hair doesn't grow very

03:42:50.261 --> 03:42:51.809
thick would be good.

03:42:51.809 --> 03:42:53.478
MARISHA: Just around under the ear.

03:42:54.488 --> 03:42:57.348
MATT: Points to the side of the chest.

03:42:57.348 --> 03:42:59.947
LAURA: That's good. That's a trendy spot.

03:43:03.527 --> 03:43:08.987
LIAM: Do you first use your window opener to make
a bit of (accented) lather?

03:43:08.987 --> 03:43:10.462
LAURA: My window opener?

03:43:10.462 --> 03:43:12.505
LIAM: Your spell. You open all the windows.

03:43:12.505 --> 03:43:13.418
LAURA: Thaumaturgy?

03:43:13.418 --> 03:43:14.125
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;.

03:43:14.125 --> 03:43:16.647
LAURA: I don't think I can shave him with
Thaumaturgy.

03:43:16.647 --> 03:43:20.105
LIAM: No, lather. Shaving cream.

03:43:20.195 --> 03:43:22.175
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh, &lt;i&gt;lather&lt;/i&gt;.

03:43:24.688 --> 03:43:27.829
LAURA: I don't think Thaumaturgy will create
lather, either.

03:43:28.119 --> 03:43:28.868
LIAM: No?

03:43:28.868 --> 03:43:33.722
LAURA: No. It would just make the sound of lather
coming out of a canister, but nothing actually

03:43:33.722 --> 03:43:34.690
will come out.

03:43:34.690 --> 03:43:36.610
LIAM: You cannot make a little bit of water
with it?

03:43:36.940 --> 03:43:37.575
LAURA: No.

03:43:37.575 --> 03:43:39.253
SAM: You are the transmuter.

03:43:39.793 --> 03:43:41.849
LIAM: I don't know everything in the world.

03:43:41.849 --> 03:43:43.137
TALIESIN: I can make water.

03:43:43.137 --> 03:43:46.508
MARISHA: Just work up a foam. Just a little bit
of--

03:43:47.928 --> 03:43:51.936
TRAVIS: Yasha just walks over and points the giant
sword at the bugbear and is like, "Arm up."

03:43:54.256 --> 03:43:55.393
MATT: "Okay."

03:43:55.414 --> 03:43:57.735
TRAVIS: (rough scraping)

03:43:57.735 --> 03:44:06.194
LIAM: Performance check. Is his scalp removed?

03:44:06.774 --> 03:44:13.066
MATT: A patchy job, but enough to maybe get a
semi-decent simple version of it.

03:44:13.067 --> 03:44:14.345
It's a simple tattoo.

03:44:14.345 --> 03:44:16.056
LAURA: It is a pretty simple tattoo.

03:44:16.057 --> 03:44:17.685
SAM: What are you going to tattoo?

03:44:17.685 --> 03:44:19.185
LAURA: Captain Tusktooth.

03:44:19.185 --> 03:44:20.564
TALIESIN: She got a thing.

03:44:20.564 --> 03:44:22.685
LAURA: I got to make a trail wherever we go.

03:44:24.455 --> 03:44:26.546
SAM: The googly-eyed Captain Tusktooth?

03:44:26.562 --> 03:44:27.472
LAURA: Obviously.

03:44:30.002 --> 03:44:35.602
MATT: As you all prepare for the evening's rest,
by the light of, I assume, probably a Light spell

03:44:35.602 --> 03:44:43.649
or that same globe within the dome, you begin to
slowly affix the next marker of Captain Tusktooth

03:44:43.649 --> 03:44:51.064
against the torso of this lone bugbear as he sits
there and rubs on his whatever it is he has around

03:44:51.065 --> 03:44:51.933
his neck.

03:44:51.933 --> 03:44:55.198
LAURA: I'm pretty close. Can I see what the
symbol is as I'm tattooing?

03:44:55.198 --> 03:44:56.633
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:45:00.713 --> 03:45:01.572
LAURA: 19.

03:45:01.907 --> 03:45:04.015
MATT: You get glimmers of it.

03:45:05.293 --> 03:45:07.028
SAM: (gasps) Whispers?

03:45:07.028 --> 03:45:07.957
TRAVIS: Shit!

03:45:07.957 --> 03:45:15.076
SAM: Late in the night whispers? Happy Valentine's
Day everybody! May all your whispers be romantic

03:45:15.966 --> 03:45:28.797
and not about bugbears. She gasped! We're all
dying. This is a devil bear.

03:45:28.797 --> 03:45:30.498
TALIESIN: We're all going to die.

03:45:31.648 --> 03:45:37.869
LAURA: Whoa. What? I'm not going to say it out
loud. I'm tattooing him.

03:45:40.230 --> 03:45:50.026
MATT: Make a-- I'll say, given the circumstances,
a general dexterity check.

03:45:50.676 --> 03:45:52.637
SAM: Oh, it's for the tattoo.

03:45:55.008 --> 03:45:55.958
LAURA: 13.

03:45:58.018 --> 03:46:05.261
MATT: It's not a very detailed tattoo. It is not
the greatest canvas under the greatest

03:46:05.261 --> 03:46:12.752
circumstances, but you figure for tattooing a
bugbear in the middle of the Xhorhasian fields

03:46:12.752 --> 03:46:15.021
in a rainstorm, it's not too bad.

03:46:15.477 --> 03:46:16.898
LAURA: I think it looks good.

03:46:16.898 --> 03:46:21.072
MATT: Yeah. The rest of you look at it. It's... eh.
It's passable.

03:46:21.073 --> 03:46:22.145
SAM: Getting better!

03:46:22.145 --> 03:46:23.024
LAURA: Thank you.

03:46:23.024 --> 03:46:25.831
LIAM: It's all that matted hair and stuff still
left behind.

03:46:25.831 --> 03:46:27.504
LAURA: It's hard to work around it.

03:46:28.724 --> 03:46:32.923
MATT: It looks like Gritty, basically, with all
the brown hair around it.

03:46:32.923 --> 03:46:37.552
LAURA: Before I finish the tusks, can I go over
and: Fjord, can I look at your tusks?

03:46:37.552 --> 03:46:38.265
TRAVIS: What?

03:46:38.275 --> 03:46:39.804
LAURA: Can I look at your mouth?

03:46:39.804 --> 03:46:40.549
TRAVIS: No.

03:46:40.549 --> 03:46:44.677
LAURA: I pull his lip down. Are they pointy or are
they still filed?

03:46:44.677 --> 03:46:47.578
TRAVIS: They're doing their thing.

03:46:47.578 --> 03:46:48.820
LAURA: Are they like this?

03:46:48.820 --> 03:46:50.605
MATT: They're starting to grow, yeah.

03:46:50.605 --> 03:46:55.609
LAURA: I'm going to do one of them a normal tusk
and then the other tusk is a little blunted tusk

03:46:55.610 --> 03:46:56.659
on this guy.

03:46:56.708 --> 03:46:57.509
MATT: Okay.

03:46:58.369 --> 03:46:59.149
TRAVIS: Thanks.

03:46:59.149 --> 03:46:59.904
LAURA: Yeah.

03:47:02.335 --> 03:47:07.553
MATT: All right. You guys bed down for the night
in the middle of the cold fields here across the

03:47:07.553 --> 03:47:16.453
river, just at the cusp of visual sight of this
City of Beasts here in the fields of the wastes.

03:47:17.033 --> 03:47:25.925
Even from this distance, you can see it's not a
small city. What glimmers of torchlight are

03:47:25.925 --> 03:47:37.212
combating the rainfall through the evening, it
looks to be lively and looks to be well-lit.

03:47:39.150 --> 03:47:41.376
That's where we'll leave tonight's episode.

03:47:42.164 --> 03:47:46.934
TRAVIS: Maybe we can spend a little time here?
Just a little? I don't know, faster than maybe,

03:47:46.934 --> 03:47:48.092
say, Darktow?

03:47:49.273 --> 03:47:52.560
SAM: You don't want to piss off the whole city
and leave the same day?

03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:55.363
TRAVIS: In and out. 12 hours. In and ex-out.

03:47:55.363 --> 03:47:57.372
TALIESIN: Two hours later: "And stay out!"

03:47:57.372 --> 03:48:04.045
TRAVIS: Amazing island of pirates? Never come
back. Never see anything. You motherfucker!

03:48:07.406 --> 03:48:08.147
MATT: Indeed.

03:48:08.147 --> 03:48:09.197
TRAVIS: Awesome stuff.

03:48:09.197 --> 03:48:10.486
TALIESIN: That was a thing.

03:48:10.486 --> 03:48:14.715
SAM: Wow. Who knew that we would be friends with a
bugbear in the middle of Xhorhas today?

03:48:14.715 --> 03:48:16.326
MARISHA: So cute! I love him.

03:48:16.336 --> 03:48:20.474
TALIESIN: Remember the last time that we
befriended an evil creature and everything went

03:48:20.474 --> 03:48:21.242
really well?

03:48:21.242 --> 03:48:23.197
LAURA: I do, I do remember that.
Are bugbears evil?

03:48:23.197 --> 03:48:24.673
TRAVIS: What's around his neck?

03:48:24.673 --> 03:48:26.716
LAURA: I'm not going to tell you right now.

03:48:26.716 --> 03:48:30.095
TALIESIN: She's not going to tell us right now,
she's going to be Laura.

03:48:30.355 --> 03:48:31.288
MATT: Anyway.

03:48:31.289 --> 03:48:32.360
SAM: Good game, Matt.

03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:35.912
MATT: Good game, guys. We'll pick this up next
week with whatever this chaos is going to be,

03:48:35.912 --> 03:48:42.752
depending on what you do. But until then, thank
you guys for those of you who are here with us

03:48:42.752 --> 03:48:46.911
tonight, spending your Valentine's day with us.
There's no other place we would rather spend it

03:48:46.911 --> 03:48:57.593
than with you guys. Sorry, microphone. I keep
doing that. Yeah, we love you very much. We're

03:48:57.593 --> 03:49:02.681
excited to see you next week, and is it Thursday
yet? Good night.

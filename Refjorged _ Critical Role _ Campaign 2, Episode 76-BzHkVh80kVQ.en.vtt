00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:02.392
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.392 --> 00:00:04.729
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:07.059
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:09.246
(laughter)

5
00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:12.722
TRAVIS: That was amazing!

6
00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:17.722
MATT: Liam is on Mica's shit list now.

7
00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:21.134
LIAM: You taunt me, and I said "yes and."

8
00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.551
MICA: Someone's going to die tonight.

9
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.118
(laughter)

10
00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:31.539
MATT: All righty, so, before we jump into tonight's episode,

11
00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.337
we have some quick announcements to get through,

12
00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:36.685
beginning with our fantastic sponsors for the night.

13
00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:39.148
We have two sponsors, and the first up,

14
00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:41.438
our friends of campaign two since the very beginning,

15
00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:43.941
D&amp;D Beyond, Sam.

16
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:47.105
SAM: It's not Sam. It's Britney, bitch.

17
00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:48.177
(laughter)

18
00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:49.180
TRAVIS: Oh no.
MATT: Oh.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.626
SAM: And...

on November 19th.

26
00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:13.578
This book provides tools to explore the world of Eberron,

27
00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:17.538
excluding the-- including the artificer class,

28

Pre-order your copy at dndbeyond.link/eberron.

31
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.680
And I must confess, it's a fantastic digital toolset

32
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.555
that manages characters, campaigns,

33
00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:37.797

34
00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:40.003
For example, what happens if...

on your digital character sheet in the app.

Yes, lost in the game, because D&amp;D Beyond

49
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:16.381
lets you focus on role playing and fun,

50
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:20.090
because the app handles the math and stats for you.

51
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.813

Anyway, this is Britney, bitch.

65
00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:55.146
Back to you, Mark.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.813

MATT: I'm not your buddy, pal.

73
00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:10.798
All right.

74
00:03:10.798 --> 00:03:13.455
LIAM: That's the way Keith Baker always imagined Eberron.

75
00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:14.433
MATT: Oh, very much so.

76
00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:15.335
TRAVIS: 100%.

77
00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:17.547
MATT: Yeah, if people don't start really rushing out

78
00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:19.094
to make Warforged in this image,

79
00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:21.732
I think we've failed as a partner.

80
00:03:21.732 --> 00:03:23.891
Sorry Keith, we're so sorry, Keith.

81
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.272
MICA: Yeah, it's so old.
MARISHA: It's super old.

82
00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:27.486
SAM: I'm a super old guy.

SAM: That was not taken from the song,

97
00:03:57.893 --> 00:03:59.464
it's an original creation.

98

101

00:04:10.572 --> 00:04:14.142
MATT: So, our friends at Idle Champions,

104
00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:16.501
Champions of the Forgotten Realms,

105
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:18.546
they've been with us a number of episodes,

106
00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:20.310
if you haven't had a chance, check out their awesome game,

107
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.781
it's available for PC, iOS, all major digital platforms

108
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:26.973
to play, you can play as all different characters

109
00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:28.229
from all over the Forgotten Realms

110
00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.727
and other D&amp;D storylines as well as playing through

111
00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:31.473
elements of the storylines within the game,

112
00:04:31.473 --> 00:04:34.900
it's awesome. They have partnered with the charity Take This

113
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.332
and are releasing the Vizier the Stellar's

114
00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:39.929
Jay Familiar NPC Pack as well in the game,

115
00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:41.114
so if you have started playing it,

116
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.756
you can look into that and help for a good cause.

117
00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:45.612
It contains the familiar, a variety of potions.

118
00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:48.552
All the net proceeds are going to special AFK rooms,

119
00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:49.696
which are volunteer-run safe spaces

120
00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:51.403
for anyone who feels overwhelmed

121
00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:53.133
and needs a place to regain their calm

122
00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:54.859
at upcoming PAX events, which is great.

123
00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:57.425
LIAM: I feel overwhelmed and the need to regain my calm.

124
00:04:57.425 --> 00:04:59.875
MATT: Then you want to donate
to help Liam at this very moment.

125
00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:01.134
TRAVIS: Yeah!

126
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.002
MATT: Go support this great cause and these great people

127
00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:06.525

128
00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:09.082
TALIESIN: Die down.

130
00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:12.900
MATT: Hmm.

131
00:05:14.217 --> 00:05:17.497
LIAM: My secondhand embarrassment is off the charts.

132
00:05:17.497 --> 00:05:19.180
(laughter)

133
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.054
MATT: He's just waiting.

134
00:05:20.054 --> 00:05:22.071
ALL: Oh!
MATT: He's just waiting in the wings.

135
00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:24.689
TRAVIS: Put that shit away!

136
00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.027
MATT: So as a heads up, we are taking a week off,

137
00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:31.129
our regularly scheduled live episode next week,

138
00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.028
some of us will be off adventuring in the dust,

139
00:05:34.028 --> 00:05:35.767
but we have something extra special for you guys

140
00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:37.305
who missed the announcement, we have

141
00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:40.566
our Dalen's Closet one-shot showing next Thursday

142
00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:44.883
in place of an episode, in which we have the wedding

143
00:05:44.883 --> 00:05:47.706
of Percival and Vex'ahlia.

144
00:05:47.706 --> 00:05:49.527
TALIESIN: Event of the summer.

145
00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:51.924
Event of the century.
MATT: A destination wedding.

146
00:05:51.924 --> 00:05:53.791
TALIESIN: You're lucky it wasn't a
<i>themed</i> destination wedding.

147
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:54.824
MATT: True.

148
00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:56.596
LAURA: Who's to say it isn't?

149
00:05:56.596 --> 00:05:57.683
Tune in to find out.

150
00:05:57.683 --> 00:06:02.020
MATT: Hopefully it will be the final destination wedding.

151
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.184
MARISHA: It's Tremor themed.

152
00:06:03.184 --> 00:06:05.266
MATT: Exactly. Perfect.

153
00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:06.977
But yeah, this one-shot was made possible

154
00:06:06.977 --> 00:06:09.227
by all you guys' fantastic generous donations

155
00:06:09.227 --> 00:06:11.088
to the Kickstarter earlier this year.

156
00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:13.643
We have other one-shots coming up as well

157
00:06:13.643 --> 00:06:15.732
as the year progresses, but this one is very special,

158
00:06:15.732 --> 00:06:17.154
we're hoping you check it out next week,

159
00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:19.618
we're really excited, hope you guys enjoy it.

160
00:06:19.618 --> 00:06:21.520
If you miss the stream, the VOD will be available

161
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.982
on our YouTube channel on Monday, September 2nd,

162
00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:26.666
following the stream.

163
00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:29.065
Also, just as a heads up guys,

164
00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:30.663
getting a little serious here for a minute,

165
00:06:30.663 --> 00:06:33.561
we, as I'm sure many of you are frustrated,

166
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.869
devastated by the fires currently happening in the Amazon

167
00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:38.104
in South America right now, in Brazil.

168
00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:40.010
We believe very strongly in leaving this world

169
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.023
a better place than we came into it as,

170
00:06:43.023 --> 00:06:45.899
and we encourage you to, if you're able,

171
00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:47.517
consider donation to one of the many

172
00:06:47.517 --> 00:06:49.671
non-profit organizations that are helping

173
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:52.352
working towards conservation of these rainforests

174
00:06:52.352 --> 00:06:56.182
and helping once these fires are done

175
00:06:56.182 --> 00:07:01.182
to reclaim and rebuild what was in their place.

176
00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:05.363
So we personally like Rainforest Trust, which has purchased

177
00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:08.722
and saved over 23 million acres of land since 1988,

178
00:07:08.722 --> 00:07:11.278
and saves an acre of rainforest every 16 seconds.

179
00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:12.853
They've been a fantastic group.

180
00:07:12.853 --> 00:07:14.457
You can find out more about their organization

181
00:07:14.457 --> 00:07:18.548
at donate.rainforesttrust.org.

182
00:07:18.548 --> 00:07:20.118
There are many other great organizations out there,

183
00:07:20.118 --> 00:07:21.868
just make sure you research them

184
00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:23.146
to see that they're legitimate.

185
00:07:23.146 --> 00:07:25.047
But if you have the opportunity,

186
00:07:25.047 --> 00:07:29.990
we implore you to be a part of making this terrible tragedy

187
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.451
as less as it possibly can and to build in its wake.

188
00:07:33.451 --> 00:07:35.139
So thank you.

189
00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.017
And with that, let's go ahead and jump into...

190
00:07:39.017 --> 00:07:39.984

MATT: And welcome back.

229
00:09:26.364 --> 00:09:29.509
Yes, Sam has decided to maintain this outfit

230
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:30.780
after the break.

231
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.488
We are thrilled.

232
00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:33.912
(laughter)

233
00:09:33.912 --> 00:09:36.516
LIAM: Can we get a Nott panicked sound right now?

234
00:09:36.516 --> 00:09:37.793
SAM: Ah--
LAURA: No!

235
00:09:37.793 --> 00:09:40.025
(groaning)

236
00:09:40.025 --> 00:09:40.920
SAM: (moaning)

237
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.753
TALIESIN: No!

238
00:09:41.753 --> 00:09:43.495
MICA: Ooh, it's extended.

239
00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:46.645
MATT: So last we left off.

240
00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:48.895
(laughter)

241
00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:54.928
The Mighty Nein, along with their new ally in Reani,

242
00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.981
had made their way from the city of Uthodurn

243
00:09:57.981 --> 00:10:00.481
to the city of Rosohna to pull in a favor

244
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:04.182
with the Shadowhand Essek to bring them instantaneously

245
00:10:04.182 --> 00:10:07.866
to the mouth of Mythburrow, where there supposedly lived

246
00:10:07.866 --> 00:10:10.774
a white dragon, one capable of enchanting

247
00:10:10.774 --> 00:10:13.220
the mithral that you had melted down,

248
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.907
and hoped to, once enchanted as iceflex,

249
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.429
to be utilized in reforming the shattered pieces

250
00:10:18.429 --> 00:10:21.986
of an ancient magical sword that you've slowly acquired

251
00:10:21.986 --> 00:10:24.563
through your adventures in this campaign.

252
00:10:24.563 --> 00:10:28.287
Upon delving into the cavern, battling yeti,

253
00:10:28.287 --> 00:10:31.023
hiding amongst the shadows, making your way

254
00:10:31.023 --> 00:10:33.892
towards the ice tunnels that led to its lair,

255
00:10:33.892 --> 00:10:35.983
you led it out

256
00:10:35.983 --> 00:10:39.698
with an ice spider queen used as bait.

257
00:10:39.698 --> 00:10:42.947
However, the item you wished to retrieve

258
00:10:42.947 --> 00:10:45.397
was dragged into the lair, and you found yourselves

259
00:10:45.397 --> 00:10:49.890
having to distract, stealth in, steal, and escape,

260
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.444
which you barely managed to do, as the dragon proved to be

261
00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:57.075
far more formidable than you had ever expected.

262
00:10:57.075 --> 00:10:59.604
In those heightened moments of intensity,

263
00:10:59.604 --> 00:11:02.062
and through an

264
00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:05.934
extremely on-point Caleb Widogast...

265
00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:08.182
LIAM: Gunter gleben glousen globen.

266
00:11:08.182 --> 00:11:10.800
(laughter)

267
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.002
LIAM: Sorry, I'm getting over a head cold.

268
00:11:13.002 --> 00:11:14.158
Almost through.

269
00:11:14.158 --> 00:11:15.647
MATT: Of course.

270
00:11:15.647 --> 00:11:19.053
You managed to step through the teleportation circle

271
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:21.318
leading you back to the city of Uthodurn,

272
00:11:21.318 --> 00:11:24.343
where you all crashed out into the center

273
00:11:24.343 --> 00:11:28.654
of the Vellum Steeple, to the surprise and confusion

274
00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:31.887
of all the various members within.

275
00:11:31.887 --> 00:11:35.304
And that is where we're picking up today.

276
00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:42.905
So, Mighty Nein, you all, sweat pouring down your faces,

277
00:11:42.913 --> 00:11:45.920
breathing heavy, the adrenaline pumping through your veins,

278
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.554
crashing and stumbling onto the hard wooden floor

279
00:11:48.554 --> 00:11:50.736
of the interior of the Vellum Steeple.

280
00:11:50.736 --> 00:11:53.054
You can see the candlelight flicking around you,

281
00:11:53.054 --> 00:11:56.072
the countless rows of books and scrolls

282
00:11:56.072 --> 00:11:57.857
and desks that got knocked over

283
00:11:57.857 --> 00:12:00.660
as you made your way in here, storming through,

284
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.790
the nearby librarians and archivists

285
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.857
looking at you confused.

286
00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.815
What would you like to do?

287
00:12:06.815 --> 00:12:09.660
LIAM: Don't mind us, sorry.
TALIESIN: Just passing through.

288
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.478
LIAM: This was done under duress.

289
00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:13.421
Apologies.

290
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:18.144
MARISHA: We have a deal with Master Ava, so, we're cool.

291
00:12:18.144 --> 00:12:20.308
MATT: Two of the glassblades that heard the commotion

292
00:12:20.308 --> 00:12:23.171
come rushing in with armor.

293
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:25.068
"Hey! What's going on?"

294
00:12:25.068 --> 00:12:28.248
TRAVIS: Please excuse the smell of feces, that's just us.

295
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.081
TALIESIN: Hey.

296
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.942
LAURA: You remember us?

297
00:12:30.942 --> 00:12:32.563
LIAM: We have an arrangement here.

298
00:12:32.563 --> 00:12:34.616
MATT: (whistles) They do like a loud whistle,

299
00:12:34.616 --> 00:12:37.113
a few other members of the Steeple

300
00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:38.179
make their way towards you,

301
00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:42.322
including the familiar sight of--

302
00:12:42.322 --> 00:12:43.194
LIAM: Kermit the Frog.

303
00:12:43.194 --> 00:12:44.757
MATT: Kermit the Frog.

304
00:12:44.757 --> 00:12:48.436
(Kermit voice) Hey guys, welcome back to Uthodurn.

305
00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:50.128
(regular voice) No, Chief Auditor Keenash.

306
00:12:50.128 --> 00:12:52.383
LAURA: Oh, what a cutie.

307
00:12:52.383 --> 00:12:54.167
MICA: Chief Otter.

308
00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:56.224
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: That's right, it's an otter.

309
00:12:56.224 --> 00:12:57.807
TALIESIN: We're going to die, yeah.

310
00:12:57.807 --> 00:12:59.697
(laughter)

311
00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:02.254
MATT: Chief Auditor.

312
00:13:02.254 --> 00:13:04.329
Which you briefly saw when you first came through,

313
00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:06.809
as well as the Scribewarden Ressia,

314
00:13:06.809 --> 00:13:08.759
come rushing into the space.

315
00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:10.928
The Scribewarden raises a hand

316
00:13:10.928 --> 00:13:14.400
and tells the guards to calm down a moment

317
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.872
before looking over and, "Well, you've certainly made

318
00:13:17.872 --> 00:13:20.705
"a returning entrance, haven't you?"

319
00:13:22.849 --> 00:13:26.085
TRAVIS: Yes, it was eventful, to say the least.

320
00:13:26.085 --> 00:13:27.964
MATT: "Good, I'm glad your patronage

321
00:13:27.964 --> 00:13:30.551
"has already come to be useful,

322
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.303
"and the patronage is appreciated,"

323
00:13:33.303 --> 00:13:35.949
as she gives a nod towards Beau.

324
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.014
MARISHA: Two Gs was worth it.

325
00:13:38.014 --> 00:13:40.579
MATT: "So, I would kindly ask you to leave

326
00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:42.655
"so we can clean up the mess you've left,

327
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.189
"unless you have other business?"

328
00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:46.714
LAURA: Oh, no, I think we're good here, we're good,

329
00:13:46.714 --> 00:13:48.321
we're just leaving--
MATT: "Very good then.

330
00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:49.749
"See them out, please."

331
00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:52.129
The glassblades make their way to flank you and--

332
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:53.858
MARISHA: What, did we leave a mess?

333
00:13:53.858 --> 00:13:55.420
MATT: You look around and there's like,

334
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.112
two of the tables have been knocked over

335
00:13:57.112 --> 00:14:00.812
as you guys arrived, there's a scattering of parchment

336
00:14:00.812 --> 00:14:03.319
and books, now the spines open.

337
00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:05.866
MARISHA: Who put the tables in the teleportation circle?

338
00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:06.699
MATT: They weren't in the circle,

339
00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:08.165
but when everyone ran through,

340
00:14:08.165 --> 00:14:11.227
the momentum carried and you ran into the table.

341
00:14:11.227 --> 00:14:13.926
MARISHA: Well this is poor fucking placement.

342
00:14:13.926 --> 00:14:15.506
(laughter)

343
00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:16.769
TALIESIN: There should be clearance, really,

344
00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:18.510
because you're going to be--
LIAM: Seems like a strange place

345
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.852
to put a tower of champagne glasses.

346
00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:22.949
(laughter)

347
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:26.433
MATT: The Scribewarden just graciously

348
00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.694
accepts the comment and goes.

349
00:14:28.694 --> 00:14:31.440
MARISHA: Just saying, fire marshal comes through here?

350
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.557
LAURA: It might not be the last time that we come in

351
00:14:33.557 --> 00:14:35.317
in this sort of manner, so you might--

352
00:14:35.317 --> 00:14:39.591
MATT: "I would very much appreciate you maybe

353
00:14:39.591 --> 00:14:42.332
"not roughhouse quite as extremely upon your arrival."

354
00:14:42.332 --> 00:14:44.945
LAURA: We will try, but sometimes dragons come after you

355
00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:47.449
and you have no choice.

356
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:49.058
MICA: Also, maybe you want to polish the floor

357
00:14:49.058 --> 00:14:51.794
because there's blood all over it, I'm sorry about that.

358
00:14:51.794 --> 00:14:53.667
MATT: "There is. Someone, please,"

359
00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:55.641
and two of the other librarians

360
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:57.445
rush off to go grab some cleaning supplies.

361
00:14:57.445 --> 00:15:00.205
You can see the squeamish look across her face.

362
00:15:00.205 --> 00:15:01.038
MICA: Sorry!

363
00:15:01.038 --> 00:15:02.104
TALIESIN: Find it funny the things you stop

364
00:15:02.104 --> 00:15:04.412
noticing after a while.

365
00:15:04.412 --> 00:15:05.739
It's weird.
MATT: "Anyway."

366
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.414
(clapping) "Please leave."

367
00:15:07.414 --> 00:15:08.705
SAM: Thank you.
LAURA: (clapping) You got it!

368
00:15:08.705 --> 00:15:09.788
SAM: Goodbye.

369
00:15:09.788 --> 00:15:13.005
MATT: You guys make your way out of the Vellum Steeple,

370
00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:16.716
back onto the streets of Uthodurn.

371
00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:18.318
TRAVIS: That was very hectic.

372
00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:20.059
Do we have everything?

373
00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:22.327
TALIESIN and LAURA: (laughter)

374
00:15:22.327 --> 00:15:24.346
TALIESIN: Yeah.

375
00:15:24.346 --> 00:15:26.574
I think that went really well, personally.

376
00:15:26.574 --> 00:15:27.970
LAURA: And look at what I've got!

377
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.602
TALIESIN: Yeah, look at that.

378
00:15:29.602 --> 00:15:30.835
SAM: What does it look like?

379
00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:33.335
LAURA: It's blue, because it is blue is what it looks like.

380
00:15:33.335 --> 00:15:35.289
MATT: You see that the mithral material,

381
00:15:35.289 --> 00:15:39.886
which looked like a sparkling silverish type,

382
00:15:39.886 --> 00:15:44.357
almost gun metal coloration to it initially,

383
00:15:44.357 --> 00:15:47.203
with elements of flakes and light in it,

384
00:15:47.203 --> 00:15:49.987
now has this dull, bluish hue, almost like

385
00:15:49.987 --> 00:15:52.652
these ice crystals have been embedded within.

386
00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:57.134
But there is no change in the actual material of it.

387
00:15:57.134 --> 00:16:01.367
It just almost seems to hold these faint specks

388
00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:04.341
of light blue energy within.

389
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:06.187
It is cold to the touch, like your fingers

390
00:16:06.187 --> 00:16:08.186
begin to go numb just clutching it in your fingers.

391
00:16:08.186 --> 00:16:09.211
LAURA: Feels good!

392
00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:13.017
SAM: We did it, we did it! We made the iceflex, right?

393
00:16:13.017 --> 00:16:14.055
TRAVIS: That was an incredible sight

394
00:16:14.055 --> 00:16:16.983
watching a giant fuck-off owl and then,

395
00:16:16.983 --> 00:16:19.613
I mean, that dragon was right behind you.

396
00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:21.770
LAURA: That dragon was huge.

397
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.390
MICA: That dragon was mean.

398
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.558
LAURA: Way bigger than I thought it was going to be.

399
00:16:25.558 --> 00:16:28.132
SAM: Are you down? Do you need healing?

400
00:16:28.132 --> 00:16:30.598
MICA: I may need to take a nap or--

401
00:16:30.598 --> 00:16:33.569
LAURA: Oh, I can help. Hold on, let me see how many spells

402
00:16:33.569 --> 00:16:35.918
I have left. I think I've got a good amount.

403
00:16:35.918 --> 00:16:39.290
MICA: Before that I want to Healing Hands myself

404
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.847
to restore nine hit points.

405
00:16:40.847 --> 00:16:42.776
TALIESIN: I was going to say, if everyone has a second,

406
00:16:42.776 --> 00:16:45.524
I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope on everybody.

407
00:16:45.524 --> 00:16:46.418
LAURA: Ooh.

408
00:16:46.418 --> 00:16:47.522
MICA: What's that do?

409
00:16:47.522 --> 00:16:49.354
LAURA: It gives us max healing.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

410
00:16:49.354 --> 00:16:51.082
So you don't have to even roll for healing.

411
00:16:51.082 --> 00:16:53.045
LAURA: Hold on, I might have Mass Cure Wounds.

412
00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.503
I don't know how many spells I have.

413
00:16:54.503 --> 00:16:55.653
TALIESIN: All right.

414
00:16:55.653 --> 00:16:57.936
LIAM: You know what else might help right now.

415
00:16:57.936 --> 00:16:59.821
Is a drink.

416
00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:02.106
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you guys do that. We should do that.

417
00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:03.456
MICA: That sounds good.

418
00:17:03.456 --> 00:17:06.004
LIAM: Is a drink.
SAM: Oh.

419
00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:09.312
<i>Is</i> a drink, oh. I thought you said "ze drink."

420
00:17:09.312 --> 00:17:11.063
LIAM: Well, sometimes, you know,

421
00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.628
it's just conversational speech.

422
00:17:12.628 --> 00:17:13.461
SAM: Sure, sure.

423
00:17:13.461 --> 00:17:15.697
LAURA: Only have Mass Healing Word. That's not as good.

424
00:17:15.697 --> 00:17:18.475
TALIESIN: Anything is-- yeah, hold on.

425
00:17:18.475 --> 00:17:19.907
MICA: I know a place.

426
00:17:19.907 --> 00:17:22.729
SAM: There's the Broken Stool Tavern. We've been there.

427
00:17:22.729 --> 00:17:24.088
LIAM: Is that where you typically go?

428
00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:26.138
Do you have a specific place that you prefer?

429
00:17:26.138 --> 00:17:30.046
MICA: If we want to go somewhere where we can just like,

430
00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:34.605
mm, we should go to the Tumbled Tankards.

431
00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:36.974
The Tumbled Tankards.

432
00:17:36.974 --> 00:17:38.890
LAURA: 29 points of healing.

433
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.022
MICA: Oh, thank you.

434
00:17:40.022 --> 00:17:42.615
TALIESIN: I'll do a Prayer of Healing.

435
00:17:42.615 --> 00:17:43.881
Yeah, I'm going to do Prayer of Healing

436
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:46.464
at level three so everyone gets...

437
00:17:47.463 --> 00:17:50.613
(counting)

438
00:17:50.613 --> 00:17:53.162
29 points of healing to everybody.

439
00:17:53.162 --> 00:17:55.433
MICA: Oh, that feels so nice.

440
00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:58.367
I can see. I can fight.

441
00:17:58.367 --> 00:18:01.766
LIAM: I have a bit of a streak going. I am unscathed.

442
00:18:01.766 --> 00:18:02.675
TRAVIS: You're untouched?

443
00:18:02.675 --> 00:18:04.516
LAURA: Well, you were hiding in the hut the entire time.

444
00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:07.363
TRAVIS: Not hiding, he was holding down the fort.

445
00:18:07.363 --> 00:18:12.188
I'm sorry, HQ was holding down the spot.

446
00:18:12.188 --> 00:18:14.723
LAURA: Right, you gave us the best place to escape to.

447
00:18:14.723 --> 00:18:15.989
Thank you so much, Caleb.

448
00:18:15.989 --> 00:18:16.954
We were very safe in there.
TALIESIN: That was the kind of

449
00:18:16.954 --> 00:18:18.078
teamwork that we needed to be showing

450
00:18:18.078 --> 00:18:21.282
from day-- that was so good. Everybody doing their best.

451
00:18:21.282 --> 00:18:23.197
LAURA: And we were super stealthy.

452
00:18:23.197 --> 00:18:24.149
SAM: It was great.

453
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:26.861
I mean, it kind of couldn't have gone better.

454
00:18:26.861 --> 00:18:28.223
I'm sorry that you almost died.

455
00:18:28.223 --> 00:18:31.175
MICA: And also we didn't get any scales for Umi.

456
00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:32.281
SAM: Oh no.

457
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:34.586
But you know what, I did get a couple of extra

458
00:18:34.586 --> 00:18:36.627
trinket items.

459
00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:38.395
LAURA: He had time, because I was grabbing the mithral.

460
00:18:38.395 --> 00:18:40.664
She had time-- sorry, sorry, Nott.

461
00:18:40.664 --> 00:18:41.822
MICA: Do you think that Umi would like them?

462
00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:42.997
Are they souvenirs?

463
00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:46.576
LAURA: Oh, you know, but--
SAM: I mean, well...

464
00:18:46.576 --> 00:18:49.048
They're very personal to me, I was up there.

465
00:18:49.048 --> 00:18:51.305
LAURA: Oh my gosh! Here, I'll do something.

466
00:18:51.305 --> 00:18:53.239
I'm going to use my paint and I'm going to draw

467
00:18:53.239 --> 00:18:56.588
a white dragon scale with my fancy paint.

468
00:18:56.588 --> 00:18:57.671
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Whoa.

469
00:18:57.671 --> 00:18:58.981
SAM: Can you do that?

470
00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:01.501
MATT: You go ahead and draw a,

471
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:05.135
based on your brief interactions with the dragon,

472
00:19:05.135 --> 00:19:07.520
a white dragon scale.

473
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.763
You're uncertain as to the quality of the scale,

474
00:19:10.763 --> 00:19:12.267
whether it matches the hardness,

475
00:19:12.267 --> 00:19:13.955
but it definitely appears to look like

476
00:19:13.955 --> 00:19:16.246
what could be a collectible white dragon scale.

477
00:19:16.246 --> 00:19:18.642
MICA: (gasps)

478
00:19:18.642 --> 00:19:21.584
Now he won't be mad at me, thank you.

479
00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:23.864
I'm going to tuck it into my--

480
00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:25.669
LAURA: Tell him not to blacksmith with it, though,

481
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:26.887
because like, it's not--

482
00:19:26.887 --> 00:19:28.403
MICA: No, no, I'm going to put it in a special

483
00:19:28.403 --> 00:19:29.403
flower crown for him

484
00:19:29.403 --> 00:19:30.807
and I'm going to make sure that he wears it.

485
00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:32.724
LAURA: Perfect.
MICA: Yeah.

486
00:19:33.948 --> 00:19:35.264
TALIESIN: That's good.

487
00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:38.139
LAURA: That's the only downside--

488
00:19:38.139 --> 00:19:40.125
one of the downsides of sitting next to Sam

489
00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:42.247
is that I don't get to see what is on--

490
00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:43.391
SAM: It's not that good.

491
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.741
It's a real-- I'm going old school today.

492
00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:47.991
(laughter)

493
00:19:49.247 --> 00:19:50.537
MATT: So, what's the plan, guys?

494
00:19:50.537 --> 00:19:52.598
LAURA: We're going to see Umi.

495
00:19:52.598 --> 00:19:55.786
SAM: But side note. Caleb, I have some items

496
00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:57.276
that maybe you should identify.

497
00:19:57.276 --> 00:19:59.005
TALIESIN: We can do that while we have a drink.

498
00:19:59.005 --> 00:20:00.830
SAM: Yeah, let's walk and talk. We're walking.

499
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.110
LIAM: Do you have booths at this place. They have booths?

500
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.000
LAURA: Booths?

501
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.833
LIAM: Booths.

502
00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:06.683
MICA: Like to sit in?
TRAVIS: A closed place to speak.

503
00:20:06.683 --> 00:20:07.724
(laughter)

504
00:20:07.724 --> 00:20:09.449
SAM: Ze booths.

505
00:20:09.449 --> 00:20:11.302
Das booths.

506
00:20:11.302 --> 00:20:12.135
MICA: <i>Ja</i>?

507
00:20:12.135 --> 00:20:13.426
TALIESIN: We went a week without the accent.

508
00:20:13.426 --> 00:20:14.609
Now we're all lost.

509
00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:16.012
(laughter)

510
00:20:16.012 --> 00:20:17.042
TRAVIS: Never been so glad to see you.

511
00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:20.397
SAM: It's just your accent has changed so much.

512
00:20:20.397 --> 00:20:22.374
LIAM: The cold got into my sinuses.

513
00:20:22.374 --> 00:20:23.880
(laughter)

514
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.713
LIAM: Infected me.

515
00:20:24.713 --> 00:20:26.302
MICA: Yeah, there's a really cool place

516
00:20:26.302 --> 00:20:27.942
that I like to sit all the time,

517
00:20:27.942 --> 00:20:30.233
and I sit there and the bartender knows me,

518
00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:31.439
so we can go there.

519
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.830
SAM: Yeah, let's go.
MICA: Let's go.

520
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.367
Make sure that you don't pick fights

521
00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:38.332
with anybody in the bar.

522
00:20:38.332 --> 00:20:39.596
MARISHA: Aww.
TALIESIN: Never.

523
00:20:39.596 --> 00:20:41.134
MICA: Just in casies.
MARISHA: Okay.

524
00:20:41.134 --> 00:20:43.342
MICA: They're all very strong.
TRAVIS: Why is that?

525
00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:44.773
Just the people in there are very--

526
00:20:44.773 --> 00:20:46.331
MICA: Everybody is very strong.

527
00:20:46.331 --> 00:20:48.114
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

528
00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:48.997
SAM: Everybody is?

529
00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:51.322
TRAVIS: Is it like a fighting bar?

530
00:20:51.322 --> 00:20:52.978
Not that we would object.

531
00:20:52.978 --> 00:20:54.993
SAM: Like a cop bar? Is that what,

532
00:20:54.993 --> 00:20:56.559
like why is it so--
MICA: No.

533
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.163
SAM: A superhero bar?

534
00:20:58.163 --> 00:21:01.489
MICA: No, let's just all be on our best behavior.

535
00:21:01.489 --> 00:21:03.822
SAM: Because it's filled with...

536
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:08.477
MICA: Best behavior time. Let's go, everybody.

537
00:21:08.477 --> 00:21:11.035
LAURA: I bet it's the arm-- yeah.

538
00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:11.958
SAM: The glassblades bar?

539
00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:12.791
LAURA: The glassblades bar.
SAM: It's a cop bar.

540
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:14.130
We're going to a cop bar.

541
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.749
TRAVIS: Cool, they'll all have mustaches.

542
00:21:15.749 --> 00:21:16.723
It'll be amazing.

543
00:21:16.723 --> 00:21:18.094
(laughter)

544
00:21:18.094 --> 00:21:18.927
SAM: Let's go!

545
00:21:18.927 --> 00:21:20.237
MATT: All righty.

546
00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:22.360
Following Reani's lead, you are brought

547
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.492
further across the Deliberation Disk,

548
00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:29.133
until eventually, a little ways out of

549
00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:30.899
the Burleboroughs,

550
00:21:30.899 --> 00:21:33.523
which is this region, this neighborhood of the area,

551
00:21:33.523 --> 00:21:37.689
you come upon a really seedy-looking dive bar,

552
00:21:37.689 --> 00:21:40.172
hidden off in a far corner,

553
00:21:40.172 --> 00:21:45.123
dark wood and stained stone and masonry hold it up.

554
00:21:45.123 --> 00:21:48.336
At first glance, it almost seems to be

555
00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:51.201
an abandoned warehouse, except for the faint bit

556
00:21:51.201 --> 00:21:53.843
of interior light that's coming through the one open window

557
00:21:53.843 --> 00:21:57.501
and the doorway, which has no door, it looks like.

558
00:21:57.501 --> 00:21:58.853
TALIESIN: Vague sound of house music.

559
00:21:58.853 --> 00:22:02.047
(laughter)

560
00:22:02.047 --> 00:22:02.880
TALIESIN: Sorry.

561
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.351
MATT: Approaching the interior, you can hear a faint tune

562
00:22:07.351 --> 00:22:10.939
as a very, very old dwarf

563
00:22:10.939 --> 00:22:12.944
is sitting there with a fiddle,

564
00:22:12.944 --> 00:22:15.968
and is staring no particular direction,

565
00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:17.666
either enraptured by his music

566
00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:19.392
or unable to focus on anything

567
00:22:19.392 --> 00:22:21.935
that's not within five feet of him,

568
00:22:21.935 --> 00:22:25.535
but is pretty decently skilled at it.

569
00:22:25.535 --> 00:22:28.630
The rest of the chamber, it's maybe 20 by 25 feet

570
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.986
total size, and of the four tables that are there

571
00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:35.079
and the two booths that are in the far corner,

572
00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:37.042
it looks like there are three other patrons.

573
00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:40.986
They all look grizzled, they all look like they want to be

574
00:22:40.986 --> 00:22:42.432
left to minding their own business,

575
00:22:42.432 --> 00:22:46.067
and they all turn and stare directly at you as you enter.

576
00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:47.901
SAM: Are they in uniform or anything?

577
00:22:47.901 --> 00:22:49.312
MATT: Not glassblades.

578
00:22:49.312 --> 00:22:50.943
SAM: Oh.

579
00:22:50.943 --> 00:22:54.555
MICA: So I want to immediately walk in and go, Vonnie!

580
00:22:54.555 --> 00:22:56.074
MATT: At which point you see around the edge,

581
00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.722
stumbling outside of a corner,

582
00:22:57.722 --> 00:23:00.062
holding a freshly tapped keg

583
00:23:00.062 --> 00:23:03.439
and placing it on the counter, you see a dwarf,

584
00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:06.307
dark-skinned, salt and pepper mop of a head of hair,

585
00:23:06.307 --> 00:23:07.992
well-trimmed goatee that comes down

586
00:23:07.992 --> 00:23:09.993
and reaches his sternum at its point,

587
00:23:09.993 --> 00:23:14.704
looks over and goes like, "Oh, hi! Reani, come here!"

588
00:23:14.704 --> 00:23:16.718
MICA: Immediately like dash over there.

589
00:23:16.718 --> 00:23:19.115
MICA: Comes over and gives you a quick little shoulder hug.

590
00:23:19.115 --> 00:23:20.864
It's like, "Ah, welcome, welcome!"

591
00:23:20.864 --> 00:23:23.062
MATT: Vonnie, I brought friends.

592
00:23:23.062 --> 00:23:24.079
MATT: "Oh."

593
00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:25.037
MICA: Yeah.

594
00:23:25.037 --> 00:23:26.540
MATT: "Okay.

595
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.373
"Hello."

596
00:23:27.373 --> 00:23:28.251
TRAVIS: Hello.
LAURA: Hi.

597
00:23:28.251 --> 00:23:30.257
SAM: What was this young man's name?

598
00:23:30.257 --> 00:23:33.413
MATT: "I'm Vonbrag. You can call me The Watch. (laughs)"

599
00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:35.040
TRAVIS: The Watch.

600
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.781
MATT: "Anyway, that's a motley crew.

601
00:23:38.781 --> 00:23:41.625
"But I mean, I wouldn't expect any less as of all this."

602
00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:45.374
MICA: We went to an ice place and we found a dragon

603
00:23:45.374 --> 00:23:47.986
and we escaped, and we barely lived, but we lived,

604
00:23:47.986 --> 00:23:49.414
and now we're back, dragons!

605
00:23:49.414 --> 00:23:51.470
MATT: "Sure, all right then."

606
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.597
TALIESIN: Strange but true.

607
00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:53.555
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "Totally."

608
00:23:53.555 --> 00:23:55.280
MARISHA: She was a spider and an owl.

609
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.113
LAURA: Yeah.

610
00:23:56.113 --> 00:23:57.446
MARISHA: It was pretty awesome. It was clutch.

611
00:23:57.446 --> 00:23:58.788
TALIESIN: Currently, not at the same time.

612
00:23:58.788 --> 00:24:00.221
MATT: "I can see why they're your friends."

613
00:24:00.221 --> 00:24:01.125
MICA: Yeah!

614
00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:02.948
MATT: "Well come, sit down.

615
00:24:02.948 --> 00:24:06.232
"Drinks, what ya looking for?

616
00:24:06.232 --> 00:24:09.190
"We got root mead. We got some--

617
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.815
TRAVIS: Root mead?

618
00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:12.498
MATT: "Have you not had a root mead?"

619
00:24:12.498 --> 00:24:14.293
TRAVIS: No, I haven't. I would love a root mead.

620
00:24:14.293 --> 00:24:15.470
MATT: "That's a root mead, then."

621
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.495
MARISHA: Is it alcoholic?
LAURA: Can I have

622
00:24:16.495 --> 00:24:17.670
some milk, please?

623
00:24:18.615 --> 00:24:20.312
Some milk?

624
00:24:20.312 --> 00:24:23.642
With maybe some like chocolate melted in it, if you have it?

625
00:24:23.642 --> 00:24:25.160
TALIESIN: That sounds good.

626
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.012
MATT: "I'll see what I can put together."

627
00:24:27.012 --> 00:24:29.484
SAM: Excuse me, but Beauregard had a question, though.

628
00:24:29.484 --> 00:24:31.959
MATT: "Yes?"
MARISHA: Is the root mead alcoholic?

629
00:24:33.508 --> 00:24:35.295
MATT: "It's mead, of course it fucking is."

630
00:24:35.295 --> 00:24:39.587
MARISHA: Well, there's this thing, root beer,

631
00:24:39.587 --> 00:24:41.517
and it's not always alcoholic.

632
00:24:41.517 --> 00:24:43.582
So just pardon my--

633
00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:44.777
MATT: "Why would they call it root beer?

634
00:24:44.777 --> 00:24:45.610
"That's stupid."

635
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.718
SAM: It really is.
MATT: "That makes no sense."

636
00:24:47.718 --> 00:24:48.650
TALIESIN: Never thought about it.

637
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.541
MARISHA: False advertising.

638
00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:50.374
MATT: "Seriously."

639
00:24:50.374 --> 00:24:54.168
LAURA: I think it has to do with the process of brewing it,

640
00:24:54.168 --> 00:24:55.907
I think.

641
00:24:55.907 --> 00:24:58.245
TRAVIS: Yes, it burns off, yeah.

642
00:24:58.245 --> 00:24:59.639
MATT: "All right, root meads all around,

643
00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:01.663
"except for some goat's milk

644
00:25:01.663 --> 00:25:03.347
"with maybe some chocolate in it."

645
00:25:03.347 --> 00:25:05.858
TALIESIN: Two goat's milk with chocolate,
that sounds exciting.

646
00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:08.378
MATT: Give me some time, I can probably pull that together.

647
00:25:08.378 --> 00:25:10.507
And what about you?

648
00:25:10.507 --> 00:25:12.740
MICA: Three glasses of root mead, please,

649
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.684
and a glass of wine,

650
00:25:15.684 --> 00:25:19.159
and small side of ale.

651
00:25:19.159 --> 00:25:20.071
SAM: Is that just for you?

652
00:25:20.071 --> 00:25:21.768
MICA: Yeah.

653
00:25:21.768 --> 00:25:22.601
SAM: Wow.

654
00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:25.354
MARISHA: Is that like a sampler flight?

655
00:25:25.354 --> 00:25:27.541
MICA: No, I'm celebrating.

656
00:25:27.541 --> 00:25:28.943
LAURA: What?
SAM: Wow.

657
00:25:28.943 --> 00:25:31.413
LAURA: That you lived your fight with the dragon?

658
00:25:31.413 --> 00:25:32.829
MICA: Yeah!
LAURA: Yeah!

659
00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:34.966
SAM: I mean, I'm already plastered, and that seems

660
00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:36.226
excessive to me.

661
00:25:36.226 --> 00:25:38.459
(laughter)

662
00:25:39.497 --> 00:25:43.227
MICA: I tend to find that alcohol doesn't work that easily,

663
00:25:43.227 --> 00:25:44.774
so I got to drink a lot of it, so I'm going to

664
00:25:44.774 --> 00:25:45.824
drink a lot of it.

665
00:25:45.824 --> 00:25:47.757
SAM: I'm with you, I'll have the same thing, please.

666
00:25:47.757 --> 00:25:50.138
MICA: Two of those!
TRAVIS: Oh Nott, I don't know if--

667
00:25:50.138 --> 00:25:51.188
MATT: "Yeah, you got it!"

668
00:25:51.188 --> 00:25:55.201
TALIESIN: I take it back, the moral high ground
has been lost now.

669
00:25:55.201 --> 00:25:56.858
MATT: "Let's see, for all that, for everyone,

670
00:25:56.858 --> 00:26:00.525
"that'll put you back about, say full spread,

671
00:26:03.224 --> 00:26:06.163
"let's call it a solid gold, how about that?"

672
00:26:06.163 --> 00:26:08.014
LAURA: I'll take care of that for everyone.

673
00:26:08.014 --> 00:26:10.581
A celebration, after all.

674
00:26:10.581 --> 00:26:12.490
MATT: Vonbrag heads off.

675
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.169
Takes a little while, and piecemeals

676
00:26:14.169 --> 00:26:15.521
the drinks to you as they come.

677
00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:16.841
The root mead's easy to bring out.

678
00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:20.845
The milk takes a bit of time and is prepared--

679
00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:22.731
it's not the best you've had, it hasn't been

680
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:24.651
stirred very well and the chocolate's kind of

681
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:26.409
congealed a bit and fallen to the bottom.

682
00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:28.224
But with a little bit of additional heat,

683
00:26:28.224 --> 00:26:30.307
maybe you could muster.
TALIESIN: I think that's precisely

684
00:26:30.307 --> 00:26:31.671
what Thaumaturgy is for at the very least.

685
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:33.478
Just to vibrate the--

686
00:26:33.478 --> 00:26:36.779
LAURA: Oh, that's good. Yeah.
TALIESIN: (Whirring) Yeah.

687
00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:38.812
MICA: Like an electric hand mixer for hot chocolate?

688
00:26:38.812 --> 00:26:40.276
MATT: There you go.
TALIESIN: Exactly.

689
00:26:40.276 --> 00:26:44.107
MATT: And your dive bar flights eventually find their way

690
00:26:44.107 --> 00:26:45.355
to your table.

691
00:26:45.355 --> 00:26:48.180
LAURA: I give him an extra gold as a tip.

692
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.944
MATT: "Oh."
SAM: 100% tip.

693
00:26:49.944 --> 00:26:51.877
MATT: Takes it and pockets it.

694
00:26:51.877 --> 00:26:54.310
"And what you looking for?"

695
00:26:57.063 --> 00:27:01.645
LAURA: Do you have any of those cupcakes that are,

696
00:27:01.645 --> 00:27:04.166
I forget the name of the bakery, but they've got

697
00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:07.369
the black moss cupcakes, and do you have any of those?

698
00:27:07.369 --> 00:27:08.997
MATT: "You're looking for cupcakes."

699
00:27:08.997 --> 00:27:10.997
LAURA: The Softer Stone Forge?

700
00:27:12.496 --> 00:27:14.018
MATT: "I don't follow."

701
00:27:14.018 --> 00:27:15.301
MARISHA: That's the baker.

702
00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:17.085
MICA: Oh Vonnie, we're just here to sit,

703
00:27:17.085 --> 00:27:20.274
we're not here for a job or anything.

704
00:27:20.274 --> 00:27:21.559
MATT: "Okay."
MICA: Yeah.

705
00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:23.984
MATT: "Is this-- ah, all right then."

706
00:27:23.984 --> 00:27:25.458
Pockets the gold, "Thank you."

707
00:27:25.458 --> 00:27:27.080
LAURA: Oh, you're welcome.

708
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.435
I thought he was asking if I wanted anything to eat.

709
00:27:29.435 --> 00:27:31.149
MICA: We can get the cupcakes after.

710
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.003
LAURA: Awesome.

711
00:27:32.003 --> 00:27:34.177
SAM: What was he asking?

712
00:27:34.177 --> 00:27:36.965
TALIESIN: We do eventually have to do
a look for some residuum,

713
00:27:36.965 --> 00:27:38.391
for the refined residuum.

714
00:27:38.391 --> 00:27:39.781
I mean, we know where it is, but at some point

715
00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:41.359
we're going to have to start thinking about what's

716
00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:42.931
the best way to go about getting that

717
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:46.628
while we wait for the sword to get finished.

718
00:27:46.628 --> 00:27:49.211
SAM: What did he mean about a job?

719
00:27:50.121 --> 00:27:51.734
TALIESIN: Yeah.

720
00:27:52.717 --> 00:27:57.244
MICA: Well, Vonnie, you know, he looks after people

721
00:27:57.244 --> 00:28:01.496
that do things for money sometimes, you know.

722
00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:04.241
TRAVIS: Is this a superhero bar?

723
00:28:04.241 --> 00:28:05.955
LIAM: Or is he your agent?

724
00:28:05.955 --> 00:28:09.304
MICA: No, Samliel's my agent.

725
00:28:09.304 --> 00:28:11.504
TRAVIS: Right.

726
00:28:11.504 --> 00:28:13.785
TALIESIN: Well, we do things for money on occasion.

727
00:28:13.785 --> 00:28:15.485
MICA: Well, you should talk to Vonnie sometime.

728
00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:17.825
Vonnie, they do things for money sometimes, too.

729
00:28:17.825 --> 00:28:18.978
TALIESIN: That's very true.

730
00:28:18.978 --> 00:28:20.966
SAM: Might I remind everyone that we already

731
00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:22.663
have an assignment if we want it.

732
00:28:22.663 --> 00:28:24.244
TALIESIN: We do.

733
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:26.911
LAURA: Yeah, which is to steal stuff.

734
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:29.559
SAM: Don't laugh at me, Fjord.

735
00:28:29.559 --> 00:28:31.778
LAURA: Well, this hot chocolate's giving me hiccups.

736
00:28:31.778 --> 00:28:33.080
(laughter)

737
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.855
I'm getting so drunk on this stuff.

738
00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:36.996
TALIESIN: Maybe we could use some of that good grace

739
00:28:36.996 --> 00:28:39.829
to maybe figure out how we're going to go about that.

740
00:28:39.829 --> 00:28:41.670
I got to admit, I've never actually,

741
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.848
I don't think I really know much about stealing things.

742
00:28:43.848 --> 00:28:45.723
SAM: Why are you hitting me?

743
00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:47.542
LAURA: Give Caleb your stuff.
MICA: Question.

744
00:28:47.542 --> 00:28:49.516
SAM: Oh, yes, while we're talking--

745
00:28:49.516 --> 00:28:50.581
LAURA: But do it super secret.

746
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:51.414
Your wig is

747
00:28:51.414 --> 00:28:52.520
shedding on your collar.
TRAVIS: We slide over to a booth

748
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.321
in the corner, whatever Reani's favorite little spot was.

749
00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:56.154
SAM: Sure.

750
00:28:56.154 --> 00:28:58.554
MATT: You find a corner of this, yeah.

751
00:28:58.554 --> 00:29:01.145
I mean, it's hidden as a booth would be.

752
00:29:01.145 --> 00:29:04.785
You're still in eye-shot of any other patron in the chamber,

753
00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:07.468
and they're all definitely keeping one eye

754
00:29:07.468 --> 00:29:11.962
by the strange cluster of colorful individuals

755
00:29:11.962 --> 00:29:14.758
that have made their way into the interior.

756
00:29:14.758 --> 00:29:17.918
TRAVIS: Anything of note of these three individuals,

757
00:29:17.918 --> 00:29:19.791
anything that really jumps out,

758
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:22.630
other than probably looking very dangerous, all of them?

759
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.095
MATT: Two of them are dwarven, one male, one female.

760
00:29:26.095 --> 00:29:29.001
They both have heavy scars visible,

761
00:29:29.001 --> 00:29:33.209
both on forearms and face and neck area.

762
00:29:34.551 --> 00:29:38.467
Cloaked, and just

763
00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:40.392
generally suspicious-looking.

764
00:29:40.392 --> 00:29:42.201
Like they just have that look about them where you're like,

765
00:29:42.201 --> 00:29:46.726
I would definitely not, you know,

766
00:29:46.726 --> 00:29:48.884
let them walk behind me when I'm trying to go home at night,

767
00:29:48.884 --> 00:29:50.461
you know, that kind of a feel.

768
00:29:50.461 --> 00:29:52.936
These are rough and tumble looking dwarves.

769
00:29:52.936 --> 00:29:56.684
There is one elf who is on the further edge

770
00:29:56.684 --> 00:29:59.580
who is looking at you, but also,

771
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.312
from what little bit of details you can make out,

772
00:30:01.312 --> 00:30:06.030
looks to have like a thin, a pencil mustache,

773
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.227
and looks very drunk and is like,

774
00:30:08.227 --> 00:30:10.826
trying to make eye contact,

775
00:30:10.826 --> 00:30:13.960
but is missing by about a foot.
LAURA: Do we recognize him?

776
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.037
MATT: Not somebody you recognize.

777
00:30:16.037 --> 00:30:17.882
TALIESIN: I think I'd remember a pencil mustache.

778
00:30:17.882 --> 00:30:18.913
Those things are like, yeah.

779
00:30:18.913 --> 00:30:20.541
MICA: Hard to forget.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

780
00:30:20.541 --> 00:30:21.763
TRAVIS: Crack out the--

781
00:30:21.763 --> 00:30:25.397
SAM: Yeah, so I'm going to stealthily and sleight of handy

782
00:30:25.397 --> 00:30:28.485
give my two items to Caleb and whisper,

783
00:30:28.485 --> 00:30:31.034
Can you identify these at some point?

784
00:30:31.034 --> 00:30:32.377
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye out to make sure

785
00:30:32.377 --> 00:30:34.532
none of these shady characters are trying

786
00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:36.639
to make a play for our loot.

787
00:30:36.639 --> 00:30:39.193
MATT: You got it, make a perception check.

788
00:30:39.193 --> 00:30:42.418
LIAM: Do we want to maybe have some of--
LAURA: What the fuck was that roll?

789
00:30:42.418 --> 00:30:43.585
LIAM: Sit with your backs--

790
00:30:43.585 --> 00:30:44.875
LAURA: It was super cocked is what it was.

791
00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:46.310
LIAM: I'll sit at the back of the booth?

792
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.851
SAM: Okay, we'll--
LAURA: 17.

793
00:30:47.851 --> 00:30:49.967
MATT: All right.
SAM: We're making a

794
00:30:49.967 --> 00:30:54.967
people wall to shield him as he's working.

795
00:30:54.991 --> 00:30:56.155
MATT: All righty.

796
00:30:56.155 --> 00:30:58.496
LIAM: So I pull out the book and slap it down,

797
00:30:58.496 --> 00:31:00.987
start cross-referencing, and it's three items?

798
00:31:00.987 --> 00:31:02.416
SAM: Two items.
LIAM: Two items?

799
00:31:02.416 --> 00:31:06.089
LAURA: One is a beautiful gem that's like different colors--

800
00:31:06.089 --> 00:31:07.115
SAM: Rainbowy.
LAURA: Yeah.

801
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:08.357
TALIESIN: Rainbowy gem.

802
00:31:08.357 --> 00:31:11.199
SAM: The other was a cold to the touch vial of something.

803
00:31:11.199 --> 00:31:12.960
LAURA: No no no, the other was a chain mail.

804
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.970
MATT: Chain mail, that was cold--

805
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.433
SAM: A cold to the touch chain mail, that's right.

806
00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:19.082
MATT: Though now that you pull it out, it's a little warmer.

807
00:31:19.082 --> 00:31:20.604
You get the sense that the cold to the touch

808
00:31:20.604 --> 00:31:22.884
may have been the metal being embedded in nearby ice

809
00:31:22.884 --> 00:31:26.276
when you procured it from the dragon.

810
00:31:26.276 --> 00:31:29.015
But yeah, you're using Identify on each?

811
00:31:29.015 --> 00:31:31.245
LIAM: Yeah, 30 minutes.

812
00:31:31.245 --> 00:31:32.293
SAM: 30 minutes?

813
00:31:32.293 --> 00:31:34.152
LIAM: Oh, unless I have it, I can't remember.

814
00:31:34.152 --> 00:31:35.037
LAURA: I thought it was 10 minutes each.

815
00:31:35.037 --> 00:31:36.049
LIAM: I might have it.

816
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:38.047
I meant 30 minutes all told, sorry, I misspoke.

817
00:31:38.047 --> 00:31:39.619
MATT: Yeah.

818
00:31:39.619 --> 00:31:40.503
TRAVIS: <i>Ja</i>?

819
00:31:40.503 --> 00:31:42.869
LAURA: <i>Ja, ja, ja.</i> Oh <i>ja</i>.

820
00:31:42.869 --> 00:31:47.081
SAM: It's pronounced jah. It's a hard J.

821
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:48.346
MICA: It's a hard G.

822
00:31:49.343 --> 00:31:50.450
LAURA: Oh gah.
MICA: Ga.

823
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.334
MATT: While he's doing that, is there anything

824
00:31:52.334 --> 00:31:53.937
you guys would like to handle while you're drinking?

825
00:31:53.937 --> 00:31:55.563
Or are you just drinking?

826
00:31:55.563 --> 00:31:56.563
SAM: Yeah!

827
00:31:56.563 --> 00:31:58.969
TALIESIN: We can start making some plans
for the rest of our--

828
00:31:58.969 --> 00:32:01.719
SAM: Okay, yes, so we have this iceflex stuff,

829
00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:03.769
we need to go back to--
LAURA: Umi.

830
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:08.769
SAM: Omagard Smeltborne and give it to them.

831
00:32:09.114 --> 00:32:10.738
But then there was this other mission.

832
00:32:10.738 --> 00:32:11.671
What was the other mission?

833
00:32:11.671 --> 00:32:13.719
MICA: I have a very important question.

834
00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:14.569
SAM: Yes?

835
00:32:14.569 --> 00:32:17.463
MICA: So, I thought about what you were saying

836
00:32:17.463 --> 00:32:22.454
about if you steal for good, then it's not bad.

837
00:32:22.454 --> 00:32:23.365
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

838
00:32:23.365 --> 00:32:25.214
MICA: Is that this situation?

839
00:32:25.214 --> 00:32:27.789
Because I asked Samliel when we went to sleep in the snow,

840
00:32:27.789 --> 00:32:31.931
and he didn't say anything, but you took from the dragon,

841
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:33.439
but the dragon was mean.

842
00:32:33.439 --> 00:32:34.803
LAURA: Right.

843
00:32:34.803 --> 00:32:36.392
MICA: So does that make it okay?

844
00:32:36.392 --> 00:32:37.905
LAURA: Oh, yeah.
SAM: Of course.

845
00:32:37.905 --> 00:32:39.488
LAURA: The dragon was trying to kill us.

846
00:32:39.488 --> 00:32:42.389
We were looking for things that would save our lives.

847
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:45.890
SAM: And help all of the world.

848
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.693
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Caleb pops his head up and says:

849
00:32:47.693 --> 00:32:49.582
Think of it not so much as a stealing.

850
00:32:49.582 --> 00:32:51.436
It's more like liberating.

851
00:32:51.436 --> 00:32:52.822
MICA: Which is good.

852
00:32:52.822 --> 00:32:55.811
LAURA: Right, because the dragon, he didn't own those things

853
00:32:55.811 --> 00:32:57.019
to begin with anyway.

854
00:32:57.019 --> 00:32:58.277
MICA: So the dragon was bad because

855
00:32:58.277 --> 00:32:59.735
he stole them--
SAM: She.

856
00:32:59.735 --> 00:33:02.565
MICA: -- she stole them and taking it from the dragon

857
00:33:02.565 --> 00:33:05.544
means that we were doing the good thing.

858
00:33:05.544 --> 00:33:06.420
LAURA: Yep.
TRAVIS: That's right.

859
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.821
It would've sat there and nothing,

860
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:10.526
but for us, they're little deposits on the side of good.

861
00:33:10.526 --> 00:33:15.526
MICA: So if we take this ring, but Madame Ava is mean to me,

862
00:33:16.335 --> 00:33:19.299
but she's not bad, but the people that took from her

863
00:33:19.299 --> 00:33:22.013
are bad, so we have to take it back to be good?

864
00:33:22.013 --> 00:33:23.329
TALIESIN: Well, and the thing that we're going to get

865
00:33:23.329 --> 00:33:25.246
from the ring is very good.

866
00:33:25.246 --> 00:33:26.791
LAURA: What are we get get from the ring?

867
00:33:26.791 --> 00:33:27.740
MICA: What are we going to get?

868
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.153
TALIESIN: The residuum.

869
00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:29.986
LAURA: Right.

870
00:33:29.986 --> 00:33:31.263
MICA: Is that stuff good?

871
00:33:31.263 --> 00:33:32.630
TALIESIN: Yes.

872
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.888
SAM: If used by good people,

873
00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:35.541
which we are?
MICA: Which you are.

874
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:36.374
TALIESIN: Like me.

875
00:33:37.229 --> 00:33:38.264
MICA: You're good.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

876
00:33:38.264 --> 00:33:39.824
MICA: I like Pinky, Pinky's good.
TRAVIS: The inflection goes down

877
00:33:39.824 --> 00:33:41.082
when you're certain.

878
00:33:41.082 --> 00:33:42.106
SAM: We <i>are.</i>

879
00:33:42.106 --> 00:33:44.188
TALIESIN: I wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't necessary

880
00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:47.053
to help to benefit honestly everything.

881
00:33:47.053 --> 00:33:48.726
MICA: Right, and you're helping Umi who's good,

882
00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:49.911
so you're good.

883
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:52.069
LAURA: Exactly, we're very good.

884
00:33:52.069 --> 00:33:54.378
TALIESIN: This is all in service of the Wildmother.

885
00:33:54.378 --> 00:33:55.996
LAURA: And the Traveler.

886
00:33:55.996 --> 00:33:57.513
TALIESIN: And the Traveler.
MICA: Who's the Traveler?

887
00:33:57.513 --> 00:34:00.377
LAURA: Oh. My. Gosh. You haven't heard of the Traveler?

888
00:34:00.377 --> 00:34:01.823
MICA: No. Is the Traveler good?

889
00:34:01.823 --> 00:34:05.043
SAM: Do you have 45 minutes?
LAURA: He's the coolest guy ever.

890
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:07.927
MICA: I want to know so much about the Traveler.

891
00:34:07.927 --> 00:34:09.194
LAURA: Let me give you have a pamphlet!

892
00:34:09.194 --> 00:34:10.035
MICA: You have a pamphlet?

893
00:34:10.035 --> 00:34:11.703
LAURA: Yeah, I made them earlier.

894
00:34:11.703 --> 00:34:12.944
MICA: Did you paint this?

895
00:34:12.944 --> 00:34:13.803
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

896
00:34:13.803 --> 00:34:15.832
MICA: That's so pretty.
LAURA: Thank you.

897
00:34:15.832 --> 00:34:16.952
SAM: The first letter of each sentence

898
00:34:16.952 --> 00:34:19.379
is bigger than the rest, it's fancy that way.

899
00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:21.507
(laughter)

900
00:34:21.507 --> 00:34:22.837
MICA: I'm going to save it for later.

901
00:34:22.837 --> 00:34:24.640
LAURA: Okay--
MICA: I'm going to read all about it.

902
00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.837
LAURA: Oh please do. He's super cool and awesome

903
00:34:26.837 --> 00:34:28.806
and he would just love you.

904
00:34:28.806 --> 00:34:31.103
MICA: I'm going to fold it up
and I'm going to tuck it in my cleavage.

905
00:34:31.103 --> 00:34:32.360
MATT: Okay.

906
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.922
MICA: Everything goes in there.

907
00:34:33.922 --> 00:34:35.248
MATT: It's an important purse.

908
00:34:35.248 --> 00:34:37.355
MICA: It's nature's pocket.
MATT: Damn right.

909
00:34:37.355 --> 00:34:39.414
All right, so.

910
00:34:39.414 --> 00:34:41.080
MICA: Bag of holding.

911
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.210
(laughter)

912
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:46.002
LIAM: Oh, I got a claymore in here.

913
00:34:46.002 --> 00:34:48.252
(laughter)

914
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:51.870
MATT: Perfect.

915
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.510
So continue to converse for a bit,

916
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.831
the alcohol definitely kicks in for all of you.

917
00:34:57.831 --> 00:34:59.429
You get a little nice buzz, but you two get

918
00:34:59.429 --> 00:35:01.578
particularly drunk.
MICA: Teehee!

919
00:35:01.578 --> 00:35:04.035
MATT: By the time you finish your Identify spell.

920
00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:05.760
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay.
TALIESIN: Where we at?

921
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.726
LIAM: Well, I can barely lift this one,

922
00:35:07.726 --> 00:35:10.040
and he dumps the elven chain mail across the table.

923
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.453
LAURA: No, it's not that heavy.

924
00:35:11.453 --> 00:35:13.051
MATT: It's actually pretty light.

925
00:35:13.051 --> 00:35:13.942
LIAM: It's not 55 pounds?

926
00:35:13.942 --> 00:35:15.008
Oh, because it's elven?

927
00:35:15.008 --> 00:35:15.927
MATT: Mm-hmm.

928
00:35:15.927 --> 00:35:17.708
LIAM: Ooh, this is so heavy.

929
00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:19.254
(laughter)

930
00:35:19.254 --> 00:35:21.348
LIAM: Caleb is very weak.

931
00:35:21.348 --> 00:35:23.307
LIAM: This is just as good as it gets,

932
00:35:23.307 --> 00:35:27.038
this is finely made, and well, it's light, for some,

933
00:35:27.038 --> 00:35:30.966
and will protect you better, so if anyone wants it,

934
00:35:30.966 --> 00:35:31.951
it's not for me.

935
00:35:31.951 --> 00:35:33.577
LAURA: It's light chain mail?

936
00:35:33.577 --> 00:35:35.187
SAM: You have to be able to wear chain mail.

937
00:35:35.187 --> 00:35:36.520
MICA: Question.
LIAM: Yeah.

938
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.997
MICA: You put him in the bubble because you said that

939
00:35:38.997 --> 00:35:41.357
he can't do things?

940
00:35:41.357 --> 00:35:42.390
LAURA: Well.

941
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.087
LIAM: He can do many things.

942
00:35:44.087 --> 00:35:46.436
He's an excellent public speaker,

943
00:35:46.436 --> 00:35:48.870
can be intimidating when he wants to,

944
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:52.074
he's very good at accents.

945
00:35:52.074 --> 00:35:54.741
MICA: Well, should we put it on him?

946
00:35:56.299 --> 00:35:59.158
LIAM: I mean, you're a good candidate for it, Fjord.

947
00:35:59.158 --> 00:36:01.450
TRAVIS: Sure, yes, I suppose if no one else--

948
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.429
MICA: He also looks good in a flower crown, he can do that.

949
00:36:03.429 --> 00:36:04.807
TALIESIN: That's fair.

950
00:36:04.807 --> 00:36:07.565
TRAVIS: I think I lost it while we were fighting the dragon

951
00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.174
in all the hubbub.

952
00:36:09.174 --> 00:36:10.708
Could you make me another?

953
00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:11.574
MICA: Yeah.

954
00:36:11.574 --> 00:36:13.314
(laughter)

955
00:36:13.314 --> 00:36:15.018
I'd like to Druidcraft a flower crown

956
00:36:15.018 --> 00:36:16.859
while this is happening.
MATT: Easy enough to do.

957
00:36:16.859 --> 00:36:21.696
The dark stained, just beer-sticky table

958
00:36:21.696 --> 00:36:23.469
that's in the middle of this tavern

959
00:36:23.469 --> 00:36:26.353
suddenly begins to sprout flowers and buds,

960
00:36:26.353 --> 00:36:30.079
and they begin to fill the space of this micro bush.

961
00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:33.768
You begin to pluck and weave, and easily enough done.

962
00:36:33.768 --> 00:36:36.023
MICA: Once I'm done, I just place it on his head.

963
00:36:36.023 --> 00:36:37.578
TALIESIN: Better.

964
00:36:37.578 --> 00:36:39.570
Really ties the whole outfit together.

965
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.608
MICA: I put extra green ones in there.

966
00:36:41.608 --> 00:36:43.545
TALIESIN: Oh, I can see.
MICA: Because I feel like it brings out--

967
00:36:43.545 --> 00:36:45.752
TALIESIN: No, the contrasting colors are really nice.

968
00:36:45.752 --> 00:36:46.789
MICA: Yeah.

969
00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:49.179
TALIESIN: It really bring out the emeralds in his skin.

970
00:36:49.179 --> 00:36:51.146
MICA: Right, right? Yeah, I feel like purple--

971
00:36:51.146 --> 00:36:53.113
LAURA: Let me see, because mine's studded armor,

972
00:36:53.113 --> 00:36:54.376
so maybe it's better than mine.

973
00:36:54.376 --> 00:36:55.422
TALIESIN: I've got like a little, you know.

974
00:36:55.422 --> 00:36:56.948
MICA: Yeah, it's beautiful.

975
00:36:58.257 --> 00:37:00.591
TRAVIS: While they're looking, what else did you find?

976
00:37:00.591 --> 00:37:02.940
LIAM: Well, this colorful stone is very interesting.

977
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.425
Again, not for me, because I don't have a good throwing arm.

978
00:37:05.425 --> 00:37:07.324
This is good for one use.

979
00:37:07.324 --> 00:37:08.339
MARISHA: Oh.

980
00:37:08.339 --> 00:37:11.700
LIAM: This, chucked into a dangerous situation,

981
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.316
will dispel any

982
00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:17.943
arcane hazard or magical problem

983
00:37:17.943 --> 00:37:20.607
that we encounter, to an extent.

984
00:37:20.607 --> 00:37:22.240
SAM: Dispel grenade?

985
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.863
Is that--
LIAM: More or less, yes.

986
00:37:23.863 --> 00:37:24.913
MARISHA: It's so pretty.

987
00:37:24.913 --> 00:37:25.746
TALIESIN: Huh.

988
00:37:25.746 --> 00:37:27.608
LIAM: Yeah, but one and done with it.

989
00:37:27.608 --> 00:37:29.316
TALIESIN: Who's got the best arm?
LAURA: Can we turn it into a

990
00:37:29.316 --> 00:37:31.805
necklace or something?
SAM: Beauregard's got a pretty sweet arm.

991
00:37:31.805 --> 00:37:34.035
MICA: Beau seems strong.

992
00:37:34.035 --> 00:37:36.258
TRAVIS: Go ahead, Smith and Wesson, let's see them.

993
00:37:36.258 --> 00:37:39.046
SAM: Maybe we should have a contest to see

994
00:37:39.046 --> 00:37:41.220
who's got the sharpest arm.

995
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.232
LAURA: Yeah, let's try.

996
00:37:42.232 --> 00:37:43.662
TALIESIN: An arm cutting contest?

997
00:37:43.662 --> 00:37:44.822
SAM: Anyone else who wants to--

998
00:37:44.822 --> 00:37:46.119
LAURA: I want to try.

999
00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:48.484
LIAM: My elbows are very pokey.

1000
00:37:48.484 --> 00:37:50.926
TRAVIS: I'll try.
LAURA: You should try, let's all try.

1001
00:37:50.926 --> 00:37:52.752
TALIESIN: I'm having a weird fear of being left out,

1002
00:37:52.752 --> 00:37:53.585
so I'm going to try.

1003
00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:57.779
MICA: I'd like to Druidcraft a vine ball for them to throw,

1004
00:37:57.779 --> 00:38:00.299
and I'd like to hold it and go: Throw this one!

1005
00:38:00.299 --> 00:38:04.890
SAM: I'm going to set up some tankards in a carnival style.

1006
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.726
Yeah, yeah, a pyramid.
MICA: Vonnie, do you mind

1007
00:38:06.726 --> 00:38:09.826
if we use the bar for a contest?

1008
00:38:10.992 --> 00:38:13.364
MATT: "I don't know, it's real busy right now,"

1009
00:38:13.364 --> 00:38:14.979
and he points, and there's nobody,

1010
00:38:14.979 --> 00:38:16.631
he's like, "Sure, fucking go for it."

1011
00:38:16.631 --> 00:38:18.039
MICA: Yay, thank you!

1012
00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:18.923
MATT: "Of course.

1013
00:38:18.923 --> 00:38:21.025
"I'm curious as to what you're thinking up."

1014
00:38:21.025 --> 00:38:22.601
MICA: I'm going to toss it over to Fjord.

1015
00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:24.110
TRAVIS: (startled) Whoa!

1016
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.327
MARISHA: All right, so what are the rules?

1017
00:38:27.173 --> 00:38:28.369
Got to get it in the center cup?

1018
00:38:28.369 --> 00:38:30.356
TRAVIS: Are we actually throwing this or something else?

1019
00:38:30.356 --> 00:38:31.763
MARISHA: Is this like beer pong?

1020
00:38:31.763 --> 00:38:33.561
LAURA: We should do like a small ball.

1021
00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:34.394
MICA: Small ball?
LAURA: Yeah.

1022
00:38:34.394 --> 00:38:36.360
MICA: All right, I'm going to take it back.

1023
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.309
SAM: Recraft?

1024
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:38.878
MICA: Recraft into a small ball.

1025
00:38:38.878 --> 00:38:40.019
LAURA: Nice.

1026
00:38:40.019 --> 00:38:40.904
MICA: Ready?
TRAVIS: Yep.

1027
00:38:40.904 --> 00:38:42.596
MICA: You got it?

1028
00:38:42.596 --> 00:38:44.680
LAURA: Good catch, Fjord.

1029
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.586
TRAVIS: Where am I throwing it?

1030
00:38:46.586 --> 00:38:48.682
TALIESIN: Going to set up a tankard on a stool

1031
00:38:48.682 --> 00:38:50.999
at the other end of the--

1032
00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:52.570
SAM: We should set up a few.

1033
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.148
LAURA: Yeah, whoever can knock over

1034
00:38:54.148 --> 00:38:57.758
the most tankards in 10 seconds.

1035
00:38:57.758 --> 00:38:59.634
That doesn't make any sense because you have to run

1036
00:38:59.634 --> 00:39:00.849
and get the thing.

1037
00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:02.525
(laughter)

1038
00:39:02.525 --> 00:39:04.054
TRAVIS: When it counts, it's only going to get one throw.

1039
00:39:04.054 --> 00:39:05.734
It should be whoever gets the closest by one throw.

1040
00:39:05.734 --> 00:39:07.284
MICA: Like milk bottles at a carnival.

1041
00:39:07.284 --> 00:39:09.844
LAURA: Whoever can throw it into the tankard.

1042
00:39:09.844 --> 00:39:10.899
MARISHA: Into the tankard?

1043
00:39:10.899 --> 00:39:13.623
SAM: Into it? that's a great one.
MARISHA: Or knocking off the tankard.

1044
00:39:13.623 --> 00:39:15.495
SAM: No, but if you have to arc it,

1045
00:39:15.495 --> 00:39:18.386
that's a little skill, that's finesse, I like it.

1046
00:39:18.386 --> 00:39:19.833
MATT: It is literally now beer pong.

1047
00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:21.726
MARISHA: It's beer pong, yeah, it's beer pong.

1048
00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.013
SAM: We're inventing beer pong.

1049
00:39:23.013 --> 00:39:24.152
SAM, LAURA, MATT, and MARISHA: Canon!

1050
00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:27.088
SAM: Mead pong, mead pong.

1051
00:39:27.088 --> 00:39:28.563
TRAVIS and MICA: Root mead pong.

1052
00:39:28.563 --> 00:39:29.397
MATT: Oh my god.

1053
00:39:29.397 --> 00:39:30.829
LIAM: You are excellent at catching projectiles.

1054
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:34.130
How are you at throwing them?

1055
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.999
MARISHA: Huh?

1056
00:39:34.999 --> 00:39:37.214
SAM and LAURA: Who are you talking to?

1057
00:39:37.214 --> 00:39:38.162
SAM: Eye contact.

1058
00:39:38.162 --> 00:39:40.073
LIAM: You, Caleb.
MARISHA: What?

1059
00:39:40.073 --> 00:39:41.586
(laughter)

1060
00:39:41.586 --> 00:39:43.277
SAM: This got weird.
LIAM: Beauregard.

1061
00:39:43.277 --> 00:39:47.103
MARISHA: Oh, me, you were not looking at me in any fashion.

1062
00:39:47.103 --> 00:39:49.326
LIAM: This is episode 76, I never have eye contact

1063
00:39:49.326 --> 00:39:51.241
with anyone when I am talking to them.

1064
00:39:51.241 --> 00:39:52.118
MARISHA: Am I good at throwing things?

1065
00:39:52.118 --> 00:39:53.663
SAM: You did last week.

1066
00:39:53.663 --> 00:39:55.913
(laughter)

1067
00:40:02.706 --> 00:40:04.483
You were so attractive.

1068
00:40:04.483 --> 00:40:06.171
(laughter)

1069
00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:07.401
MATT: I agree.

1070
00:40:07.401 --> 00:40:09.651
(laughter)

1071
00:40:10.502 --> 00:40:12.602
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm pretty good at throwing shit.

1072
00:40:12.602 --> 00:40:15.310
TRAVIS: Right, so we set up one cup across the room

1073
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.783
and another one where we started,

1074
00:40:16.783 --> 00:40:18.204
and that way we can just throw back and forth

1075
00:40:18.204 --> 00:40:19.425
and see who gets the closest.

1076
00:40:19.425 --> 00:40:20.448
SAM: Great.

1077
00:40:20.448 --> 00:40:23.082
MATT: The three other patrons are confused

1078
00:40:23.082 --> 00:40:26.826
by this scenario. It seems to be the most rambunctious space

1079
00:40:26.826 --> 00:40:29.221
they've been present to in a while.

1080
00:40:29.221 --> 00:40:31.099
Gather in the far corner, and you can see them

1081
00:40:31.099 --> 00:40:32.749
quietly begin to make wagers with each other.

1082
00:40:32.749 --> 00:40:34.970
TRAVIS: I'm just saying--

1083
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.001
MATT: So who's doing what first?

1084
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:40.304
TRAVIS: I'll go first, I'll take the, is the cup ready?

1085
00:40:40.304 --> 00:40:41.700
Is it ready?

1086
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.714
TALIESIN: Cup's all set.
TRAVIS: All right.

1087
00:40:43.714 --> 00:40:44.822
How high is the ceiling?

1088
00:40:44.822 --> 00:40:48.019
Is it low, medium, are there rafters, are there--

1089
00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:49.752
MATT: There are rafters,

1090
00:40:49.752 --> 00:40:51.362
in the most basic sense of the form.

1091
00:40:51.362 --> 00:40:54.001
You see two crossbars across the way.

1092
00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:55.464
TRAVIS: Okay, they're not hanging low.

1093
00:40:55.464 --> 00:40:57.335
MATT: No.

1094
00:40:57.335 --> 00:40:58.827
It's actually three oil lanterns

1095
00:40:58.827 --> 00:41:00.462
that give all the light in the interior

1096
00:41:00.462 --> 00:41:01.941
of this entire space, so it's pretty dark.

1097
00:41:01.941 --> 00:41:03.440
TRAVIS: All right.
MATT: You have good darkvision, you're fine.

1098
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.446
TRAVIS: I'll give a little sidearm action

1099
00:41:04.446 --> 00:41:06.248
and try and put a little loft under it.

1100
00:41:06.248 --> 00:41:07.081
MATT: Okay.

1101
00:41:07.081 --> 00:41:09.973
As it's thrown, I'm saying, for the purposes of this,

1102
00:41:09.973 --> 00:41:13.996
the ball can be either strength or dex, your choice.

1103
00:41:13.996 --> 00:41:18.996
TRAVIS: Oh, both suck anus, so, you know, let's go dex.

1104
00:41:19.259 --> 00:41:20.092
MATT: Great.

1105
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.193
TRAVIS: Six.

1106
00:41:24.478 --> 00:41:27.422
MATT: It goes wide and (impacts) against the far corner.

1107
00:41:27.422 --> 00:41:29.017
MARISHA: Yeah, cap'n!

1108
00:41:29.017 --> 00:41:29.919
Yeah!

1109
00:41:29.919 --> 00:41:31.292
TRAVIS: My hands are sweaty.

1110
00:41:31.292 --> 00:41:32.989
Knees weak, arms ahead.

1111
00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:33.822
All right.

1112
00:41:33.822 --> 00:41:35.736
MICA: Mom's spaghetti.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

1113
00:41:35.736 --> 00:41:37.229
MATT: Bringing it back.

1114
00:41:37.229 --> 00:41:39.269
TRAVIS: I'll go fetch it.

1115
00:41:39.269 --> 00:41:40.531
No, somebody has to go over there and fetch it

1116
00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:41.740
and throw it back.

1117
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.257
SAM: I'll go.
LAURA: Why?

1118
00:41:43.257 --> 00:41:45.740
SAM: We're playing back and forthies.

1119
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.986
I'll go over--

1120
00:41:46.986 --> 00:41:48.682
LIAM: Frumpkin goes and brings it back,

1121
00:41:48.682 --> 00:41:49.992
and will continue to do so.

1122
00:41:49.992 --> 00:41:52.730
MATT: Carrying it in their mouth.

1123
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:53.914
SAM: I'm tossing.

1124
00:41:53.914 --> 00:41:55.081
MATT: All right.

1125
00:41:55.081 --> 00:41:56.381
Strength or dex?

1126
00:41:56.381 --> 00:41:57.214
SAM: Dex.

1127
00:41:59.015 --> 00:42:01.487
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, check or?

1128
00:42:01.487 --> 00:42:03.020
MATT: Just add your dexterity modifier.

1129
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.489
SAM: Am I still drunk?

1130
00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:05.787
MATT: Yes, you are.

1131
00:42:05.787 --> 00:42:08.642
Technically it's an attack roll, so you don't have to--

1132
00:42:08.642 --> 00:42:09.816
SAM: Okay.

1133
00:42:09.816 --> 00:42:11.471
Well then, it's still nine.

1134
00:42:11.471 --> 00:42:13.293
MATT: Nine.

1135
00:42:13.293 --> 00:42:14.977
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Nein!

1136
00:42:14.977 --> 00:42:17.532
MATT: Much like Robin Hood split his own arrow,

1137
00:42:17.532 --> 00:42:19.486
you throw it in the exact same corner

1138
00:42:19.486 --> 00:42:22.106
that Fjord did, with no improvement.

1139
00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:23.158
TRAVIS: Ey, hey hey!

1140
00:42:23.158 --> 00:42:24.198
SAM: The group, the group.

1141
00:42:24.198 --> 00:42:25.623
TRAVIS: Yes, grouping.

1142
00:42:25.623 --> 00:42:28.541
MATT: Almost surprisingly accurate for the wrong direction.

1143
00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:29.705
So well done.

1144
00:42:29.705 --> 00:42:31.191
Frumpkin goes ahead and retrieves it,

1145
00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:33.629
and in the mouth, (purrs), drops it.

1146
00:42:33.629 --> 00:42:36.095
MARISHA: Thanks, kitty cat.

1147
00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:37.320
SAM: Come on, Beau.

1148
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.697
MATT: Strength or dex, ad your modifier.

1149
00:42:38.697 --> 00:42:39.530
MARISHA: Dex.

1150
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.096
SAM: Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy.

1151
00:42:41.096 --> 00:42:42.673
MARISHA: Hang on, that's heavy, that's a heavy one.

1152
00:42:42.673 --> 00:42:43.751
MATT: (impact) Oh no.

1153
00:42:43.751 --> 00:42:45.310
TRAVIS: Are you throwing this into the backboard of your--

1154
00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:46.456
MARISHA: That's how he did it.

1155
00:42:47.406 --> 00:42:48.739
LIAM: Bank shot.

1156
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:50.422
LAURA: Oh no.

1157
00:42:50.422 --> 00:42:51.572
MARISHA: 10.

1158
00:42:51.572 --> 00:42:52.771
MATT: 10.

1159
00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:55.270
TRAVIS: Wow, I'm glad this doesn't count

1160
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.930
for anything life-threatening right now.

1161
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.550
(laughter)

1162
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.743
MATT: This one actually hits the tankard,

1163
00:43:00.743 --> 00:43:02.852
but it hits the very edge of the rim

1164
00:43:02.852 --> 00:43:03.869
and then bounces off.

1165
00:43:03.869 --> 00:43:05.178
So it's the closest anyone's gotten,

1166
00:43:05.178 --> 00:43:07.950
but definitely not within the actual cup.

1167
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.115
SAM: Just trying to get closest.

1168
00:43:09.115 --> 00:43:10.645
LAURA: Here we go, here we go, here we go.

1169
00:43:10.645 --> 00:43:11.492
SAM: Come on, Jessie.

1170
00:43:11.492 --> 00:43:12.637
TRAVIS: I was expecting way better.

1171
00:43:12.637 --> 00:43:13.740
MARISHA: Mead creeps up on you.

1172
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.548
LAURA: I'm up.
LIAM: Get it, get it.

1173
00:43:15.548 --> 00:43:16.564
SAM: Yeah.

1174
00:43:16.564 --> 00:43:18.030
MATT: Strength or dex, your choice.

1175
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:19.169
SAM: Right in the hole.

1176
00:43:19.169 --> 00:43:21.995
LAURA: I'm going to go dex.

1177
00:43:21.995 --> 00:43:22.930
Wait, no.

1178
00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:24.699
I'll go, yeah, dex.

1179
00:43:24.699 --> 00:43:27.496
SAM: Put this ball in the hole.

1180
00:43:28.479 --> 00:43:30.799
MATT: So add your dex modifier, not your saving throw.

1181
00:43:30.799 --> 00:43:32.155
LAURA: 14.

1182
00:43:32.155 --> 00:43:33.216
MATT: 14.

1183
00:43:33.216 --> 00:43:34.488
SAM: In the teens now.

1184
00:43:34.488 --> 00:43:38.315
MATT: You go ahead and lob the small sphere

1185
00:43:38.315 --> 00:43:42.879
of condensed, tangled bits of vine,

1186
00:43:42.879 --> 00:43:47.654
and it actually enters the cup, and like slowly rolls,

1187
00:43:47.654 --> 00:43:50.421
and almost tumbles out, but then stays within.

1188
00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:52.090
(cheering)

1189
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:52.931
TRAVIS: What what!

1190
00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:54.231
SAM: Nice!

1191
00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:55.363
She hasn't been drinking.

1192
00:43:55.363 --> 00:43:56.908
TALIESIN: Just because, I got to try too, all right.

1193
00:43:56.908 --> 00:43:58.794
All right.

1194
00:43:58.794 --> 00:43:59.961
Going for dex.

1195
00:44:01.606 --> 00:44:02.981
MICA: Oh.
TALIESIN: 11.

1196
00:44:02.981 --> 00:44:03.997
MATT: 11.

1197
00:44:03.997 --> 00:44:06.482
It hits the corner and like, circles a bit

1198
00:44:06.482 --> 00:44:08.970
before it spins off and doesn't land inside.

1199
00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:10.542
TRAVIS: So close.
TALIESIN: That's fair, that's fair.

1200
00:44:10.542 --> 00:44:12.148
SAM: Well, there we have it.

1201
00:44:12.148 --> 00:44:15.108
Reani, are you competing as well, or no?

1202
00:44:15.108 --> 00:44:18.127
MICA: I mean, I don't want to keep the stone, but I can try.

1203
00:44:18.127 --> 00:44:19.214
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not.

1204
00:44:19.214 --> 00:44:20.186
MICA: Okay.

1205
00:44:20.186 --> 00:44:22.154
All right, wait, everybody threw it.

1206
00:44:22.154 --> 00:44:24.227
LAURA: I know, I didn't throw mine, I should've thrown it.

1207
00:44:24.227 --> 00:44:26.194
SAM: Well, you won.

1208
00:44:26.194 --> 00:44:27.027
TALIESIN: Hey.

1209
00:44:27.027 --> 00:44:27.860
LAURA: Oh.

1210
00:44:28.912 --> 00:44:30.194
Oh, whoa.

1211
00:44:30.194 --> 00:44:32.966
MATT: Strength or dex.
MICA: That's 15.

1212
00:44:32.966 --> 00:44:34.430
MATT: 15.

1213
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:38.929
Inside the cup, rests directly, like almost a swish,

1214
00:44:38.929 --> 00:44:40.262
not quite, it does hit the edge of it.

1215
00:44:40.262 --> 00:44:41.095
TRAVIS: Well done.

1216
00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:42.689
MARISHA: She's got to be fucking good at everything.

1217
00:44:42.689 --> 00:44:44.969
MICA: I did it.
SAM: Good back spin.

1218
00:44:44.969 --> 00:44:46.610
LAURA: I did it.
MICA: I did it. (giggles)

1219
00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.107
(laughter)

1220
00:44:49.107 --> 00:44:50.651
TALIESIN: Good call.

1221
00:44:50.651 --> 00:44:51.635
SAM: Wow.
TRAVIS: Excellent.

1222
00:44:51.635 --> 00:44:54.076
LAURA: Wow.
SAM: Well, I guess you get to keep it.

1223
00:44:54.076 --> 00:44:55.227
MICA: No!

1224
00:44:55.227 --> 00:44:56.720
LAURA: You don't want to?

1225
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.951
MARISHA: You should give it to Umi.

1226
00:44:58.951 --> 00:45:00.460
MICA: Do you think Umi would like it?

1227
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.293
TRAVIS: Well...

1228
00:45:01.293 --> 00:45:05.204
(Travis and Laura talking at once)

1229
00:45:05.204 --> 00:45:07.808
TRAVIS: I think it's in safe hands with Jester,

1230
00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:09.998
and she'll use it expertly to, you know,

1231
00:45:09.998 --> 00:45:12.338
get us out of some arcane shit.

1232
00:45:12.338 --> 00:45:13.800
SAM: Reani is a superhero.

1233
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.683
TALIESIN: On the other hand--

1234
00:45:14.683 --> 00:45:16.341
TRAVIS: She doesn't need help, she's a superhero.

1235
00:45:16.341 --> 00:45:17.182
SAM: Okay, that's fair.

1236
00:45:17.182 --> 00:45:19.100
TALIESIN: On the other hand, that chain mail

1237
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.396
might be a perfect fit.

1238
00:45:20.396 --> 00:45:22.814
LAURA: I do have Dispel Magic already, so I feel like

1239
00:45:22.814 --> 00:45:25.121
somebody else really should use this.

1240
00:45:25.121 --> 00:45:26.570
SAM: Someone like Reani?

1241
00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:27.403
LAURA: Someone--

1242
00:45:27.403 --> 00:45:30.069
LIAM: How far are you able to--

1243
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:31.161
Jester?
LAURA: Huh?

1244
00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:34.897
LIAM: How far out are you able to dispel things?

1245
00:45:34.897 --> 00:45:37.277
LAURA: That's a good question.

1246
00:45:37.277 --> 00:45:40.281
Probably pretty far, but maybe not that far.

1247
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:42.999
MICA: Can we give it to Beau because Beau is strong?

1248
00:45:42.999 --> 00:45:43.832
SAM: Sure.

1249
00:45:43.832 --> 00:45:45.176
LAURA: I mean, I'm stronger than Beau.

1250
00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:46.848
I don't want to like brag or anything,

1251
00:45:46.848 --> 00:45:49.398
but I am really fucking strong.
MICA: But if you can dispel magic,

1252
00:45:49.398 --> 00:45:50.888
then you already have it--
LAURA: But yeah, Beau really needs it,

1253
00:45:50.888 --> 00:45:54.088
and I can do it up to 120 feet, which really is pretty far.

1254
00:45:54.088 --> 00:45:57.977
MICA: And Beau smacked a yeti in the face and it died.

1255
00:45:57.977 --> 00:45:59.842
MARISHA: This feels like a consolation prize.

1256
00:45:59.842 --> 00:46:01.051
Am I being pitied?

1257
00:46:01.051 --> 00:46:02.023
TRAVIS: Yes, absolutely.

1258
00:46:02.023 --> 00:46:02.856
MARISHA: Do you want it?

1259
00:46:02.856 --> 00:46:03.781
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you.

1260
00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:06.031
(laughter)

1261
00:46:06.949 --> 00:46:08.809
MICA: I was trying to help.

1262
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:10.664
SAM: Good contest, everyone.

1263
00:46:10.664 --> 00:46:12.914
(laughter)

1264
00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.087
TRAVIS: Four, four items.

1265
00:46:16.087 --> 00:46:18.337
(Count Von Count laughter)

1266
00:46:20.042 --> 00:46:22.873
Yes, boom!

1267
00:46:22.873 --> 00:46:24.530
MICA: We need to get you a Rolodex, damn.

1268
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.078
TRAVIS: Read 'em and weep, bitches.

1269
00:46:27.078 --> 00:46:28.533
Oh shit, no! Three!

1270
00:46:28.533 --> 00:46:30.110
(laughter)

1271
00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.536
MATT: And just like that.

1272
00:46:31.536 --> 00:46:32.584
MICA: Three items.

1273
00:46:32.584 --> 00:46:35.485
TRAVIS: He giveth and he taketh away.

1274
00:46:35.485 --> 00:46:38.067
TALIESIN: I think the chain mail might be a nice gift.

1275
00:46:38.067 --> 00:46:39.698
TRAVIS: To Umi, yes.

1276
00:46:39.698 --> 00:46:42.687
LAURA: Oh, I just put it on, but I can take it off.

1277
00:46:42.687 --> 00:46:44.770
(laughter)

1278
00:46:46.202 --> 00:46:47.516
TRAVIS: Jester, put it back on.

1279
00:46:47.516 --> 00:46:49.148
SAM: Do you need it, Caduceus?

1280
00:46:49.148 --> 00:46:50.976
TALIESIN: I'm fine.
SAM: Okay.

1281
00:46:50.976 --> 00:46:54.343
Here, Reani, oh wait, do you need it?

1282
00:46:54.343 --> 00:46:57.109
LAURA: I mean, it's better than my armor, but I don't--

1283
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:58.576
SAM: Well, then keep it, keep it, keep it.

1284
00:46:58.576 --> 00:46:59.676
TRAVIS: We have the white dragon scale,

1285
00:46:59.676 --> 00:47:00.992
it's a wonderful gift.
MICA: We have the dragon scale,

1286
00:47:00.992 --> 00:47:03.261
he'll be happy.
TALIESIN: All right. Let's--

1287
00:47:03.261 --> 00:47:05.475
SAM: All right, let's plan.

1288
00:47:05.475 --> 00:47:08.279
TALIESIN: Let's go deliver the goods, and then we'll talk

1289
00:47:08.279 --> 00:47:12.051
about the next step of this mission.

1290
00:47:12.051 --> 00:47:13.414
SAM: Okay.

1291
00:47:13.414 --> 00:47:14.752
We'll go to--
TALIESIN: And maybe a nap.

1292
00:47:14.752 --> 00:47:16.352
TRAVIS and SAM: Omigerd.

1293
00:47:16.352 --> 00:47:17.232
TALIESIN: Because a lot's happened today.

1294
00:47:17.232 --> 00:47:19.080
SAM: Shmerberg.

1295
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:19.913
MATT: Okay.

1296
00:47:19.913 --> 00:47:21.390
TALIESIN: Urma Ermagerd?

1297
00:47:22.373 --> 00:47:23.576
MATT: You guys go ahead and make your way back

1298
00:47:23.576 --> 00:47:24.648
to the Anvil of Smeltborne.

1299
00:47:24.648 --> 00:47:27.068
LIAM: Actually, Caleb waits till everyone walks out

1300
00:47:27.068 --> 00:47:29.938
and looks across the room with a cup

1301
00:47:29.938 --> 00:47:33.188
and pulls out a little wad of bat shit.

1302
00:47:34.974 --> 00:47:36.724
LAURA: You're going to do it?

1303
00:47:39.748 --> 00:47:40.623
LIAM: 16.

1304
00:47:40.623 --> 00:47:43.152
(laughter)

1305
00:47:43.152 --> 00:47:44.427
MATT: Bloop.

1306
00:47:47.348 --> 00:47:48.794
Nothing but mug.

1307
00:47:48.794 --> 00:47:51.044
(clapping)

1308
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.620
That was beautiful.

1309
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.389
MICA: Frumpkin saw it and that's all that counts.

1310
00:47:57.389 --> 00:47:59.691
MATT: And Frumpkin won't tell anyone.

1311
00:47:59.691 --> 00:48:02.210
Frumpkin keeps all the secrets.

1312
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:03.289
(laughter)

1313
00:48:03.289 --> 00:48:04.622
MICA: Later that night Speaks with Animals.

1314
00:48:04.622 --> 00:48:05.922
So what happened when we left?

1315
00:48:05.922 --> 00:48:07.462
MATT: Let me tell you, girl.

1316
00:48:07.462 --> 00:48:08.636
Shit was cray.

1317
00:48:08.636 --> 00:48:09.760
All right.

1318
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.766
You guys make your way to the Anvil of Smeltborne

1319
00:48:11.766 --> 00:48:16.091
outside of the Moradin's Mantle temple.

1320
00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:17.037
You guys good?

1321
00:48:17.037 --> 00:48:18.332
Have any questions?

1322
00:48:18.332 --> 00:48:20.469
SAM: Just about armor class.

1323
00:48:20.469 --> 00:48:21.302
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

1324
00:48:21.302 --> 00:48:24.455
LAURA: Because I put on this, and it's AC 14,

1325
00:48:24.455 --> 00:48:27.079
and I took off my studded armor, which is AC 12,

1326
00:48:27.079 --> 00:48:30.816
but my armor class didn't go up.

1327
00:48:30.816 --> 00:48:34.280
MATT: Because the higher tiers of armor

1328
00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.595
don't allow as much of your dex modifier, possibly.

1329
00:48:37.595 --> 00:48:38.995
LAURA: Oh.

1330
00:48:41.188 --> 00:48:42.583
Here Reani.

1331
00:48:42.583 --> 00:48:43.746
(laughter)

1332
00:48:43.746 --> 00:48:45.606
I think you should use this, try it out.

1333
00:48:45.606 --> 00:48:47.670
MATT: What's your dex bonus?

1334
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:48.829
LAURA: Plus four.

1335
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:50.664
MATT: Your dex bonus is plus four?

1336
00:48:50.664 --> 00:48:52.395
So yeah, so there's going to be a limitation

1337
00:48:52.395 --> 00:48:57.395
to the dex modifier the armor will allow, unfortunately.

1338
00:48:57.875 --> 00:48:59.298
TALIESIN: Dex modifiers, man.

1339
00:48:59.298 --> 00:49:01.597
MATT: Yeah, she rolled some crazy stats.

1340
00:49:01.597 --> 00:49:02.497
LAURA: Here you go.

1341
00:49:02.497 --> 00:49:04.398
MICA: Okay, thank you.

1342
00:49:04.398 --> 00:49:07.228
I'm going to give it to Umi.

1343
00:49:07.228 --> 00:49:11.936
MATT: As you approach the exterior

1344
00:49:11.936 --> 00:49:14.412
of the Smeltborne Anvil,

1345
00:49:14.412 --> 00:49:18.252
you can hear the clanging of metal against metal,

1346
00:49:18.252 --> 00:49:20.548
familiar to the last time you were here.

1347
00:49:20.548 --> 00:49:24.362
However, as you enter, you do not see Umagorn at the forge,

1348
00:49:24.362 --> 00:49:27.443
instead you see Deilin, as she's in the process

1349
00:49:27.443 --> 00:49:29.450
of hammering some sort of

1350
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:32.340
a small metallic object of some kind,

1351
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.292
holding it with tongs and just

1352
00:49:34.292 --> 00:49:37.739
lightly tapping it against the side of the anvil.

1353
00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:40.046
Off in the corner, you see with a big mug

1354
00:49:40.046 --> 00:49:41.691
of some sort of steaming liquid,

1355
00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:44.530
and currently in the process of thumbing through a book,

1356
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:49.358
you see Umagorn, hair a bit disarray,

1357
00:49:49.358 --> 00:49:52.304
dirty brow, glance up and go,

1358
00:49:52.304 --> 00:49:54.943
"Ooh, you've all returned already.

1359
00:49:54.943 --> 00:49:57.281
"That's faster than I expected.

1360
00:49:57.281 --> 00:49:58.766
"Or have you not left yet?"

1361
00:49:58.766 --> 00:50:01.146
MICA: Guess what, we lived!

1362
00:50:01.146 --> 00:50:02.873
LAURA: We killed a dragon.

1363
00:50:02.873 --> 00:50:05.389
MICA: We didn't kill it.
LAURA: Slaughtered it dead.

1364
00:50:05.389 --> 00:50:06.430
MICA: Jester!

1365
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:09.398
SAM: The only thing left is this one dragon scale.

1366
00:50:09.398 --> 00:50:10.629
MATT: Make a deception check.

1367
00:50:10.629 --> 00:50:12.977
(laughter)

1368
00:50:12.977 --> 00:50:13.826
LAURA: One.

1369
00:50:13.826 --> 00:50:15.356
(laughter)

1370
00:50:15.356 --> 00:50:17.985
MATT: Umagorn goes, "Right.

1371
00:50:17.985 --> 00:50:20.911
"Well, congratulations on taking down--"
LAURA: Thank you so much,

1372
00:50:20.911 --> 00:50:22.892
we're so hardcore.

1373
00:50:22.892 --> 00:50:25.053
MATT: "I'm blown away by your skill.

1374
00:50:25.053 --> 00:50:26.143
"Did you actually go?"

1375
00:50:26.143 --> 00:50:29.627
MICA: We did. Guess what! And I fish out the scale.

1376
00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:33.002
I'm like: I got you a thing. And I hold up the chain mail,

1377
00:50:33.002 --> 00:50:36.471
I'm like we got you a thing, and we got you a thing!

1378
00:50:36.471 --> 00:50:38.783
MATT: He puts down what you can see now is coffee

1379
00:50:38.783 --> 00:50:40.530
and it sloshes on the side of his mug, goes,

1380
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:43.472
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you serious?"

1381
00:50:43.472 --> 00:50:44.875
LAURA: Which one do you want first?

1382
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:45.958
MICA: So many.

1383
00:50:45.958 --> 00:50:47.868
MATT: "Well, the mithral."

1384
00:50:47.868 --> 00:50:49.823
MICA: That makes sense.

1385
00:50:49.823 --> 00:50:51.076
He holds it and goes, "Ow."

1386
00:50:51.076 --> 00:50:53.025
You see him moving it from hand to hand

1387
00:50:53.025 --> 00:50:55.478
as the cold temperature of it burns his fingers,

1388
00:50:55.478 --> 00:50:57.941
he's like, he looks up at you with a look that just says

1389
00:50:57.941 --> 00:50:59.628
how are you holding it so easily?

1390
00:50:59.628 --> 00:51:02.615
Then sets it on the table and looks it over.

1391
00:51:02.615 --> 00:51:05.115
"I'm going to be perfectly honest.

1392
00:51:07.757 --> 00:51:09.883
"This is the first time I've actually seen this.

1393
00:51:09.883 --> 00:51:11.962
"This is really impressive.

1394
00:51:11.962 --> 00:51:13.678
"I've only read about this material.

1395
00:51:13.678 --> 00:51:14.678
"So it's--"

1396
00:51:16.372 --> 00:51:18.559
SAM: But you can work with it, right?

1397
00:51:18.559 --> 00:51:20.339
MATT: "I have all the notes for it."

1398
00:51:20.339 --> 00:51:21.172
SAM: Notes?

1399
00:51:21.172 --> 00:51:22.338
MATT: "Right."
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1400
00:51:22.338 --> 00:51:23.220
LAURA: Yeah.

1401
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.626
MARISHA: You're sure it's blue enough,
based on what you've read?

1402
00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:28.926
TRAVIS: It better be, we're not going back.

1403
00:51:28.926 --> 00:51:29.759
MARISHA: I know.

1404
00:51:29.759 --> 00:51:31.744
MATT: He takes it and holds it in his hand.

1405
00:51:31.744 --> 00:51:34.772
"I'm pretty sure that's good to go."

1406
00:51:34.772 --> 00:51:36.735
TALIESIN: Do you need to take it to the anvil,

1407
00:51:36.735 --> 00:51:39.334
or is it going to be okay to do it here? Do you need--

1408
00:51:39.334 --> 00:51:41.194
MATT: "Oh, no, this needs to be forged

1409
00:51:41.194 --> 00:51:42.627
"where it was originally reinforced.

1410
00:51:42.627 --> 00:51:45.355
"We're going to have to make a trip to the Cinderrest."

1411
00:51:45.355 --> 00:51:47.586
SAM: We should get the stuff.

1412
00:51:47.586 --> 00:51:49.119
TALIESIN: We should get what we need, then.

1413
00:51:49.119 --> 00:51:51.587
LAURA: The glass before, yeah.

1414
00:51:51.587 --> 00:51:53.949
TRAVIS: Refined asiduum.

1415
00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:54.782
LAURA: Yeah.

1416
00:51:55.736 --> 00:51:57.173
TRAVIS: Next stop.

1417
00:51:57.173 --> 00:51:58.495
MATT: "What's that?"

1418
00:51:58.495 --> 00:52:01.408
MARISHA: He was abbreviating, or truncating,

1419
00:52:01.408 --> 00:52:03.466
or don't worry about it.

1420
00:52:03.466 --> 00:52:05.465
MATT: "What else are you holding there?"

1421
00:52:05.465 --> 00:52:07.925
MICA: I have a scale and I have chain mail.

1422
00:52:07.925 --> 00:52:10.095
Oh my god, it rhymes.

1423
00:52:10.095 --> 00:52:11.321
Gifts.

1424
00:52:11.321 --> 00:52:12.321
MATT: "Is this..."

1425
00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:15.492
LAURA: It's elven chain mail.
LIAM: It's jifts.

1426
00:52:15.492 --> 00:52:18.070
MATT: "That's beautiful.

1427
00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:18.903
"Wow."

1428
00:52:18.903 --> 00:52:20.509
LAURA: I was going to keep it, but then we were like,

1429
00:52:20.509 --> 00:52:23.228
Oh my gosh, Umi probably needs it more than anyone else,

1430
00:52:23.228 --> 00:52:24.749
he could probably use it.

1431
00:52:24.749 --> 00:52:27.491
MATT: "I mean, I could look at this, and maybe just

1432
00:52:27.491 --> 00:52:29.937
"from inspecting it and doing a bit of research,

1433
00:52:29.937 --> 00:52:33.343
"I can look to maybe make a similar type armor."

1434
00:52:33.343 --> 00:52:34.550
LAURA: Oh, good.

1435
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.766
MICA: Yeah.

1436
00:52:35.766 --> 00:52:38.956
MATT: "I haven't quite spent too much time

1437
00:52:38.956 --> 00:52:42.338
"researching the old ways of elven smithing.

1438
00:52:42.338 --> 00:52:45.021
"Sticking to my lineage, but maybe it's time

1439
00:52:45.021 --> 00:52:46.780
"to cross over a bit, huh?"

1440
00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.354
LAURA: I mean, there's plenty of elves here,

1441
00:52:48.354 --> 00:52:52.940
they would probably be happy to patronize your shop.

1442
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:53.773
MATT: (chuckles)

1443
00:52:53.773 --> 00:52:55.545
You see him jangling it in his hand

1444
00:52:55.545 --> 00:52:57.279
and he holds it.

1445
00:52:57.279 --> 00:52:58.611
"That's very light."

1446
00:52:58.611 --> 00:53:00.606
Tosses it over his shoulder and looks at the scale.

1447
00:53:00.606 --> 00:53:02.407
"That's pretty.

1448
00:53:02.407 --> 00:53:04.324
"Lighter than I expected."

1449
00:53:05.734 --> 00:53:07.065
MICA: Do you like it?

1450
00:53:07.065 --> 00:53:09.397
MATT: "It's very nice, thank you."

1451
00:53:09.397 --> 00:53:12.889
MICA: Guess what, guess what, I didn't die.

1452
00:53:13.951 --> 00:53:15.095
MATT: "I'm proud of you."

1453
00:53:15.095 --> 00:53:16.392
MICA: Thanks.

1454
00:53:16.392 --> 00:53:18.660
MATT: "Don't go and do that again.

1455
00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.827
"Don't push it.

1456
00:53:20.778 --> 00:53:21.611
"I'm proud of you."

1457
00:53:21.611 --> 00:53:22.444
MICA: Thanks.

1458
00:53:22.444 --> 00:53:23.948
MATT: He pats you on the shoulder.

1459
00:53:23.948 --> 00:53:26.407
TRAVIS: Do you have a lot of experience

1460
00:53:26.407 --> 00:53:29.895
making other protective items?

1461
00:53:29.895 --> 00:53:33.170
Armor, things that might keep a newly squishy person

1462
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:35.493
a bit less squish?

1463
00:53:35.493 --> 00:53:37.262
MICA: Umi, he's talking about himself.

1464
00:53:37.262 --> 00:53:38.857
Can you help him not be squishy?

1465
00:53:38.857 --> 00:53:40.839
TRAVIS: Or anyone else with an attractive face

1466
00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:43.107
and squishy characteristics.

1467
00:53:43.107 --> 00:53:45.204
LIAM: Also DM, I have a question.

1468
00:53:45.204 --> 00:53:47.188
Chain mail in the book, says you need

1469
00:53:47.188 --> 00:53:49.287
a strength of 13 to wear it, is that true

1470
00:53:49.287 --> 00:53:50.734
for this chain mail?
MATT: Yes.

1471
00:53:50.734 --> 00:53:53.437
Well, hold on, what does it say specifically?

1472
00:53:53.437 --> 00:53:54.561
LIAM: I don't have it anymore.

1473
00:53:54.561 --> 00:53:57.771
TALIESIN: Even if you are not proficient with medium armor.

1474
00:53:57.771 --> 00:53:59.579
Lack proficiency with medium armor.

1475
00:53:59.579 --> 00:54:01.224
MATT: Right.
MICA: Would you like to read the paper?

1476
00:54:01.224 --> 00:54:03.449
LAURA: Yeah, it doesn't say anything about.

1477
00:54:03.449 --> 00:54:05.532
It's still 20 pounds.

1478
00:54:05.532 --> 00:54:08.109
MATT: Still 20 pounds, 20 pounds is still less than it is

1479
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:09.850
in the book, if I'm correct, right?

1480
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:12.023
What's the weight of--
LIAM: 55 pounds.

1481
00:54:12.023 --> 00:54:14.940
LAURA: Yeah, so, that's way better. MATT: So I would, that doesn't make much sense to me.

1482
00:54:17.286 --> 00:54:18.678
I'd say the purpose of elven chain mail

1483
00:54:18.678 --> 00:54:21.183
initially is that it's meant to be much more lightweight

1484
00:54:21.183 --> 00:54:23.432
and probably would not have the same strength requirement,

1485
00:54:23.432 --> 00:54:25.131
in my opinion.
LIAM: Okay.

1486
00:54:25.131 --> 00:54:26.894
SAM: So he could wear it?

1487
00:54:26.894 --> 00:54:28.589
MATT: That's how I'm ruling it in my campaign.

1488
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:30.185
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1489
00:54:30.185 --> 00:54:32.437
SAM: (sings piano music)

1490
00:54:32.437 --> 00:54:34.724
TRAVIS: Don't.
(laughter)

1491
00:54:34.724 --> 00:54:36.557
LAURA: So we gave it away, but you could use it.

1492
00:54:36.557 --> 00:54:37.874
LIAM: Could possibly use--

1493
00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:39.931
MATT: Nott suffers 14 points of damage.

1494
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:40.764
SAM: Oh no.

1495
00:54:40.764 --> 00:54:44.324
(laughter)

1496
00:54:44.324 --> 00:54:48.161
MICA: In exchange for the everybody being very nice

1497
00:54:48.161 --> 00:54:51.079
and helping us get the ice stuff,

1498
00:54:51.079 --> 00:54:56.064
could we possibly make armor for the squishy people?

1499
00:54:56.064 --> 00:54:57.739
MATT: "I mean, I can make armor,

1500
00:54:57.739 --> 00:54:59.189
"but I have armor already made.

1501
00:54:59.189 --> 00:55:00.364
"It depends what you're looking for.

1502
00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:02.199
"You need splint mail, you need--

1503
00:55:02.199 --> 00:55:03.556
"I mean, I make chain mail fine,

1504
00:55:03.556 --> 00:55:06.053
"that takes a while and I've got three bits back here,

1505
00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:08.099
"but I mean, to be honest, this is better

1506
00:55:08.099 --> 00:55:10.950
"than what I can make. I'm not an enchanter."

1507
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:14.815
TRAVIS: I'm a little curious about what plate mail

1508
00:55:14.815 --> 00:55:16.996
might look like, something that actually,

1509
00:55:16.996 --> 00:55:19.404
you know, protects.

1510
00:55:19.404 --> 00:55:23.281
MATT: "Well that I can do, but--" and he looks you over.

1511
00:55:23.281 --> 00:55:25.184
"I mean no offense, I don't know if you've got

1512
00:55:25.184 --> 00:55:27.639
"the physique for it."

1513
00:55:27.639 --> 00:55:28.472
TRAVIS: Oh.

1514
00:55:29.753 --> 00:55:30.761
Right.

1515
00:55:30.761 --> 00:55:32.269
MATT: He points over in the corner and you see

1516
00:55:32.269 --> 00:55:34.300
hanging on one of

1517
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.667
like four different wooden armatures,

1518
00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:39.909
one is like a torso, there is an upper part

1519
00:55:39.909 --> 00:55:43.679
of full plate mail. It's beautifully crafted,

1520
00:55:43.679 --> 00:55:46.221
large shoulder spaulders and guards that go up

1521
00:55:46.221 --> 00:55:49.176
past the sides of the head. It's just gorgeous,

1522
00:55:49.176 --> 00:55:51.422
with like chain underneath as well as, you know,

1523
00:55:51.422 --> 00:55:54.952
the interior, what's called the gambion,

1524
00:55:54.952 --> 00:55:57.971
the cloth material that's between the skin and the armor.

1525
00:55:57.971 --> 00:56:02.266
It's beautiful, looks heavy as fuck, and very cumbersome.

1526
00:56:02.266 --> 00:56:03.274
TRAVIS: Right.

1527
00:56:04.614 --> 00:56:08.298
SAM: I think what he's saying is that you need deltoids

1528
00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:11.784
and traps even just to keep it on your form.

1529
00:56:11.784 --> 00:56:13.927
Because you don't have any of those,

1530
00:56:13.927 --> 00:56:15.098
it will just slide right off.

1531
00:56:15.098 --> 00:56:17.917
MATT: "If we're being honest here, and I appreciate

1532
00:56:17.917 --> 00:56:21.880
"the gifts you've given me, but if you're looking

1533
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:26.001
"for armor to protect you, I've got no use for this

1534
00:56:26.001 --> 00:56:28.334
"other than to resell it."

1535
00:56:28.334 --> 00:56:31.340
LIAM: I feel awkward taking something back from you,

1536
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.238
but you know, we also--

1537
00:56:32.238 --> 00:56:33.304
MATT: "You're not taking it back from me.

1538
00:56:33.304 --> 00:56:35.004
"I'm giving it back.

1539
00:56:35.004 --> 00:56:36.518
"If you're looking to keep yourself alive

1540
00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:39.635
"and you're going after dragons and some shit like that,

1541
00:56:39.635 --> 00:56:41.246
"best not get yourself killed," and he throws

1542
00:56:41.246 --> 00:56:42.951
the chain back to you.

1543
00:56:42.951 --> 00:56:45.151
SAM: Is that something that you can use?

1544
00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:47.820
TALIESIN: Anyone can use it.
TRAVIS: Anyone can use it.

1545
00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:49.362
Caleb could use it.

1546
00:56:49.362 --> 00:56:50.567
LIAM: I could use it.

1547
00:56:50.567 --> 00:56:52.593
LAURA: Put it on, Caleb. You're so little.

1548
00:56:52.593 --> 00:56:53.759
SAM: Do you not have armor?

1549
00:56:53.759 --> 00:56:57.014
TRAVIS: I do, I have the mariner's breastplate.

1550
00:56:57.014 --> 00:57:00.264
LIAM: I start to take off this purple cloak

1551
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:05.545
and another inner layer, and I start

1552
00:57:05.545 --> 00:57:07.578
to slide into this thing.

1553
00:57:07.578 --> 00:57:09.626
Ooh, it's quiet.

1554
00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:11.882
LAURA: Ish, it's quiet-ish.

1555
00:57:11.882 --> 00:57:14.107
LIAM: If I put my coat on over it, it's muffled.

1556
00:57:14.107 --> 00:57:15.773
You can't hear it.

1557
00:57:15.773 --> 00:57:18.143
TALIESIN: I can hear a bit of it.

1558
00:57:18.143 --> 00:57:19.837
LIAM: Well you can hear and see anything.

1559
00:57:19.837 --> 00:57:21.071
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair.
MICA: Is it comfy?

1560
00:57:21.071 --> 00:57:22.594
TRAVIS: Do that again, tap your chest.

1561
00:57:22.594 --> 00:57:23.838
LIAM: (high-pitched) Boobies boobies boobies.

1562
00:57:23.838 --> 00:57:25.868
(laughter)

1563
00:57:25.868 --> 00:57:27.303
SAM: It does that every time?

1564
00:57:27.303 --> 00:57:31.193
TRAVIS: Very strange, elves are so mysterious.

1565
00:57:31.193 --> 00:57:34.760
Their ways are foreign and wonderful.

1566
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:37.052
(laughter)

1567
00:57:37.052 --> 00:57:38.887
SAM: Those elves.

1568
00:57:38.887 --> 00:57:40.432
MICA: Those elves have their priorities.

1569
00:57:40.432 --> 00:57:43.273
(laughter)

1570
00:57:43.273 --> 00:57:45.340
MATT: So the idea here is, depending on who decides it,

1571
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.936
with chain mail, it does give you an AC of 16 base.

1572
00:57:47.936 --> 00:57:50.107
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: No dexterity bonus.

1573
00:57:50.107 --> 00:57:51.316
LIAM: Yeah.

1574
00:57:51.316 --> 00:57:53.050
MATT: So, you lose any dex bonus and you--

1575
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.242
LIAM: That would bring me to 15.

1576
00:57:55.242 --> 00:57:57.512
SAM: Does it help you?
MARISHA: Really?

1577
00:57:57.512 --> 00:58:01.345
LIAM: It's 16, but no dex bonus, so I would be at--

1578
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:04.991
wait wait wait, yeah.

1579
00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:06.377
That would put me--
SAM: 15 or 16?

1580
00:58:06.377 --> 00:58:09.661
LIAM: This would be higher than I've ever, ever been.

1581
00:58:09.661 --> 00:58:12.477
MATT: Does Mage Armor put you at--?

1582
00:58:12.477 --> 00:58:16.160
LIAM: I go 11 normally, 14 with Mage Armor.

1583
00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.604
MATT: Gotcha, so it'd bring you up to 16.

1584
00:58:17.604 --> 00:58:18.437
LAURA: Wow.

1585
00:58:18.437 --> 00:58:19.562
SAM: Whoa.

1586
00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:20.723
TRAVIS: Enthusiastic yes.

1587
00:58:20.723 --> 00:58:24.648
LAURA: That's probably the most defended mage in history,

1588
00:58:24.648 --> 00:58:25.545
I think.

1589
00:58:25.545 --> 00:58:27.293
MATT: Wait, is it chain mail or chain shirt?

1590
00:58:27.293 --> 00:58:28.177
LIAM: Chain mail.

1591
00:58:28.177 --> 00:58:29.461
MATT: Chain mail, got it.

1592
00:58:29.461 --> 00:58:30.821
What's it say on there particularly?

1593
00:58:30.821 --> 00:58:31.654
LIAM: Oh, chain shirt.

1594
00:58:31.654 --> 00:58:33.574
Chain mail, and under it it says chain shirt.

1595
00:58:33.574 --> 00:58:34.444
SAM: It's a chain shirt.

1596
00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:35.277
MATT: Gotcha, it's called chain mail,

1597
00:58:35.277 --> 00:58:36.110
but it is a chain shirt.

1598
00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:38.189
LIAM: (groans) So that's different.

1599
00:58:38.189 --> 00:58:40.188
MATT: Sorry.

1600
00:58:40.188 --> 00:58:42.265
Chain shirt is 13 plus dex.

1601
00:58:42.265 --> 00:58:43.188
LIAM: Okay.

1602
00:58:43.188 --> 00:58:44.898
SAM: What's your dex?

1603
00:58:44.898 --> 00:58:46.341
LIAM: It is 13 plus dex?

1604
00:58:46.341 --> 00:58:50.181
That still gets me to 14 without Mage Armor.

1605
00:58:50.181 --> 00:58:51.941
So it is still an improvement.

1606
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:54.846
MATT: But it's a plus one chain mail, I believe?

1607
00:58:54.846 --> 00:58:55.755
LAURA: Yes.

1608
00:58:55.755 --> 00:58:56.588
LIAM: Yes?

1609
00:58:56.588 --> 00:58:57.751
MATT: Correct, which would bring it up to a 15.

1610
00:58:57.751 --> 00:58:58.597
LIAM: 15.

1611
00:58:58.597 --> 00:59:01.055
TRAVIS: Oh, happy days are here.

1612
00:59:01.055 --> 00:59:02.362
LIAM: I'm Mr. Frodo.

1613
00:59:02.362 --> 00:59:04.533
(laughter)

1614
00:59:04.533 --> 00:59:06.128
MATT: Chain mail's heavy armor.

1615
00:59:06.128 --> 00:59:08.275
(laughter)

1616
00:59:08.275 --> 00:59:09.416
LIAM: Sam.

1617
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:10.959
TALIESIN: Everyone gets a stab.

1618
00:59:10.959 --> 00:59:12.725
TRAVIS: Fool of a Took. Yeah.

1619
00:59:13.814 --> 00:59:17.890
MATT: So, elven chain mail is a vestige of older D&amp;D.

1620
00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:19.147
TALIESIN: Dex modifier, yeah.

1621
00:59:19.147 --> 00:59:20.865
Armor's always weird to figure out.

1622
00:59:20.865 --> 00:59:23.563
That's fun.
MATT: Indeed.

1623
00:59:23.563 --> 00:59:25.129
MICA: Oh, he's so happy.

1624
00:59:25.129 --> 00:59:27.212
LIAM: Yep! Yes I am.

1625
00:59:27.212 --> 00:59:28.940
LAURA: (laughs)
MARISHA: It's nice.

1626
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.179
It refracts the light in a weird way.

1627
00:59:31.179 --> 00:59:34.982
Have this like, disco wizard quality to you.

1628
00:59:34.982 --> 00:59:36.299
Yes.

1629
00:59:36.299 --> 00:59:38.917
MATT: That's why I was confused with the strength earlier,

1630
00:59:38.917 --> 00:59:40.844
I was like, "There's no strength requirement."

1631
00:59:40.844 --> 00:59:43.296
For the chain mail there is, not a chain shirt.

1632
00:59:43.296 --> 00:59:47.290
Sorry for confusing myself and I'm sure a lot of you.

1633
00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:50.873
Anyway, Umi's like, "I mean, I don't know how soon

1634
00:59:50.873 --> 00:59:53.436
"you're looking to go, but we have to pack a bit."

1635
00:59:53.436 --> 00:59:55.212
Looks back at Deilin, who's still working,

1636
00:59:55.212 --> 00:59:57.431
and walks over to Deilin and gets her attention

1637
00:59:57.431 --> 00:59:59.515
from the work, and she looks up and kind of

1638
00:59:59.515 --> 01:00:02.497
wipes her forehead, looks back and sees the rest of you,

1639
01:00:02.497 --> 01:00:07.247
smiles and waves, her little waifish elven smile.

1640
01:00:09.215 --> 01:00:11.795
Umi signs to her a bit and she signs back

1641
01:00:11.795 --> 01:00:15.512
and sets down the tongs, and nods and walks over

1642
01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:16.869
and starts packing.

1643
01:00:16.869 --> 01:00:18.990
Umi's like, "Well----

1644
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.148
TALIESIN: We have one last bit of business.

1645
01:00:21.148 --> 01:00:22.642
What's that family name--

1646
01:00:22.642 --> 01:00:23.508
MATT: "She's my assistant, so she's

1647
01:00:23.508 --> 01:00:24.941
going to have to come with me."

1648
01:00:24.941 --> 01:00:26.080
TALIESIN: Oh, of course.

1649
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.492
MATT: "I need all the help I can get."

1650
01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:31.947
SAM: We were going to go to the Tumblecarves.

1651
01:00:31.947 --> 01:00:33.595
Tumblecarves?

1652
01:00:33.595 --> 01:00:35.826
They're the ones with the red ring?

1653
01:00:35.826 --> 01:00:37.845
MATT: "What are you going to Tumblecarves for?"

1654
01:00:37.845 --> 01:00:38.931
LAURA: Have you heard of them?

1655
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:39.764
MATT: "Yeah."

1656
01:00:39.764 --> 01:00:40.690
LIAM: Are they dicks?

1657
01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:41.797
MATT: "Yeah!

1658
01:00:41.797 --> 01:00:46.230
"Stuffy-ass fucking noble family,

1659
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:47.821
"bunch of bastards. Why?"
SAM: We need to retrieve an--

1660
01:00:47.821 --> 01:00:48.862
TRAVIS: Normal family?

1661
01:00:48.862 --> 01:00:50.537
MATT: "Noble."
TRAVIS: Oh.

1662
01:00:50.537 --> 01:00:53.318
SAM: We needed to retrieve an item for Ava?

1663
01:00:53.318 --> 01:00:56.145
MICA: Yeah, and they told me that if you take

1664
01:00:56.145 --> 01:01:01.129
something from someone that's bad, it's good, so it's okay.

1665
01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:04.840
MATT: "That's sound, maybe.

1666
01:01:05.955 --> 01:01:09.899
"Look, if you're getting tangled in with those folk,

1667
01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:12.918
"and Ava, just don't mention my name."

1668
01:01:12.918 --> 01:01:13.929
SAM: Okay.

1669
01:01:13.929 --> 01:01:15.735
TRAVIS: We can do that.

1670
01:01:15.735 --> 01:01:17.242
SAM: I don't really know how to pronounce it.

1671
01:01:17.242 --> 01:01:18.142
TALIESIN: What kind of business are they in,

1672
01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:19.267
out of curiosity?

1673
01:01:19.267 --> 01:01:21.171
MATT: "To be honest, I don't fuckin' know.

1674
01:01:21.171 --> 01:01:22.603
"It's not my business."

1675
01:01:22.603 --> 01:01:25.019
TRAVIS: Just not well-regarded?

1676
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:29.591
MATT: "I don't mean any offense, but like--

1677
01:01:29.591 --> 01:01:31.624
"offense is a strange term,

1678
01:01:31.624 --> 01:01:35.165
but there's certain castes

1679
01:01:35.165 --> 01:01:39.163
"in the city where the nobles are

1680
01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:42.189
"well known for their affiliations.

1681
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:47.401
"These folk, well, they're...

1682
01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:49.501
"known to be into some strange stuff.

1683
01:01:50.755 --> 01:01:51.616
TRAVIS: Strange?

1684
01:01:51.616 --> 01:01:54.223
Like arcanely strange?

1685
01:01:54.223 --> 01:01:56.641
MATT: "Collectors."
TRAVIS: Oh.

1686
01:01:56.641 --> 01:01:59.141
MATT: "They tend to send out servants

1687
01:01:59.141 --> 01:02:00.657
"looking for odds and ends,

1688
01:02:00.657 --> 01:02:03.605
"and then they show up suddenly and mysteriously

01:02:03.605 --> 01:02:06.091
"knowing about things that just made their way

01:02:06.091 --> 01:02:08.848
"into town for sale, strange collectibles.

01:02:08.848 --> 01:02:11.234
"They're very in the know."

1692
01:02:11.234 --> 01:02:13.178
LAURA: Oh, they're going to have so many things.

1693
01:02:13.178 --> 01:02:15.121
I bet they're going to have traps, though.

1694
01:02:15.121 --> 01:02:18.674
TRAVIS: Hands in your pockets when we go in.

1695
01:02:18.674 --> 01:02:20.383
LAURA: I don't ever steal things.

1696
01:02:20.383 --> 01:02:21.919
SAM: I do.

1697
01:02:21.919 --> 01:02:24.999
MARISHA: Has there been any rumor of criminal activity

1698
01:02:24.999 --> 01:02:28.914
that they've been involved in, smuggling?

1699
01:02:28.914 --> 01:02:30.481
MATT: "I haven't the foggiest.

1700
01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:32.589
"Tumblecarves tend to keep to their own.

1701
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:34.944
"I think I've only walked past maybe one or two of them,

1702
01:02:34.944 --> 01:02:38.186
"and they just look like right pricks, anyway."

1703
01:02:38.186 --> 01:02:40.805
MARISHA: Would I have any knowledge of that name?

1704
01:02:40.805 --> 01:02:42.109
MATT: You can make a history check.

1705
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:43.167
MARISHA: Okay.

1706
01:02:43.167 --> 01:02:48.160
MICA: Question, does this crew run with that one bad faction

1707
01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.579
that's name is escaping me?

1708
01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:53.811
MATT: You haven't really had any interaction

1709
01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:57.115
with the Tumblecarves at all.

1710
01:02:57.115 --> 01:02:59.065
Like may have heard the name once, but that's about it.

1711
01:02:59.065 --> 01:02:59.915
MICA: All right.

1712
01:02:59.915 --> 01:03:00.772
MARISHA: 21.

1713
01:03:00.772 --> 01:03:01.605
MATT: 21.

1714
01:03:03.995 --> 01:03:07.200
Because it's Uthodurn and you spent most of your life

1715
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.366
in the Empire, I'd say...

1716
01:03:11.466 --> 01:03:14.467
you may have read the name in a book once in just a

1717
01:03:14.467 --> 01:03:18.909
paragraph talking about the diarchy of Uthodurn

1718
01:03:18.909 --> 01:03:21.389
and the various noble families in power.

1719
01:03:21.389 --> 01:03:23.634
But, you've heard of it, you know

1720
01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.866
it's a legitimate noble family,

1721
01:03:25.866 --> 01:03:30.055
you know that they've been part of Uthodurnian society

1722
01:03:30.055 --> 01:03:33.234
installed for probably 10 generations or so.

1723
01:03:33.234 --> 01:03:35.967
So they're old blood.
MARISHA: Okay.

1724
01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:40.104
MATT: That's like dwarven generations, too,

1725
01:03:40.104 --> 01:03:45.099
which is-- we're looking at probably been involved since,

1726
01:03:45.099 --> 01:03:47.474
you know, a few centuries after the Calamity.

1727
01:03:47.474 --> 01:03:49.512
So they've been around for hundreds of years.

1728
01:03:49.512 --> 01:03:51.883
As a noble family.

1729
01:03:51.883 --> 01:03:53.617
That's the best that you can make out.

1730
01:03:53.617 --> 01:03:55.492
But that's something.
MARISHA: Okay.

1731
01:03:55.492 --> 01:03:57.141
TALIESIN: I mean, we're going to be okay.

1732
01:03:57.141 --> 01:03:58.866
We've got a good plan.

1733
01:03:58.866 --> 01:04:00.750
Or we're going to have a good plan.

1734
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:03.892
(laughter)

1735
01:04:03.892 --> 01:04:08.243
MICA: I mean, I think if we got stuff back from a dragon

1736
01:04:08.243 --> 01:04:10.822
that almost killed us, we can get stuff back

1737
01:04:10.822 --> 01:04:12.880
from a bunch of nobles.

1738
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.628
MATT: "You're not wrong.

1739
01:04:14.628 --> 01:04:18.502
"With that comparison, I think you're on a roll.

1740
01:04:18.502 --> 01:04:21.083
"Just don't be stupid."

1741
01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:22.083
MARISHA: Is it bad that the nobles

1742
01:04:22.083 --> 01:04:23.834
scare me more than a dragon?

1743
01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:25.550
TALIESIN: No, I'm actually having a lot of--

1744
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:27.408
more tension, feeling of tension.

1745
01:04:27.408 --> 01:04:29.275
LIAM: We have some experience with that sort of thing,

1746
01:04:29.275 --> 01:04:32.124
though, our group.
TALIESIN: We do?

1747
01:04:32.124 --> 01:04:34.624
LIAM: Apologies, before your time.

1748
01:04:34.624 --> 01:04:35.508
TALIESIN: Oh, oh.

1749
01:04:35.508 --> 01:04:37.516
LAURA: Yeah, and Beau almost died wrapped up in a carpet.

1750
01:04:37.516 --> 01:04:39.112
MICA: No!
LAURA: Yeah.

1751
01:04:39.112 --> 01:04:40.009
TALIESIN: I could see that.

1752
01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.911
LAURA: Okay, no carpets for Beau.

1753
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.549
TRAVIS: Yes, no dying by rug.

1754
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:44.382
MARISHA: Well--

1755
01:04:45.234 --> 01:04:46.768
SAM: Different kind.

1756
01:04:46.768 --> 01:04:48.409
TRAVIS: Oh my...

1757
01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:50.604
fucking--

1758
01:04:50.604 --> 01:04:51.583
MARISHA: I mean--

1759
01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:53.477
LIAM: Beau fell prey to a rug muncher. It is true.

1760
01:04:53.477 --> 01:04:54.433
(laughter)

1761
01:04:54.433 --> 01:04:56.823
TRAVIS: Little lob and just dunk.

1762
01:04:56.823 --> 01:04:59.316
TALIESIN: I can't remember, are you above me or below me?

1763
01:04:59.316 --> 01:05:00.163
MARISHA: Huh?

1764
01:05:00.163 --> 01:05:01.854
TALIESIN: Above me or below me on the screen?

1765
01:05:01.854 --> 01:05:02.970
I can never remember.

1766
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:04.266
MARISHA: I think I'm below you.

1767
01:05:04.266 --> 01:05:05.837
TALIESIN: All right, fist bump.

1768
01:05:05.837 --> 01:05:08.087
(laughter)

1769
01:05:09.234 --> 01:05:10.567
TALIESIN: That was good.

1770
01:05:11.477 --> 01:05:12.535
MICA: That was so smooth.

1771
01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:13.452
TALIESIN: So proud.

1772
01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:18.385
SAM: Just to clarify, we need to go reclaim,

1773
01:05:18.385 --> 01:05:21.625
liberate from these nobles because we need

1774
01:05:21.625 --> 01:05:24.696
refined residuum glass.

1775
01:05:24.696 --> 01:05:27.947
And my bag of residuum is not good enough.

1776
01:05:27.947 --> 01:05:29.381
We already tried that, right?

1777
01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:30.464
TALIESIN: We did.
SAM: Okay.

1778
01:05:30.464 --> 01:05:32.275
LAURA: We need the crystals that Ava has.

1779
01:05:32.275 --> 01:05:33.401
SAM: And we're sure that we will get

1780
01:05:33.401 --> 01:05:36.142
refined residuum glass if we complete this mission.

1781
01:05:36.142 --> 01:05:36.975
LAURA: Yes.

1782
01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:40.700
MATT: You were shown a sizeable quantity of it by Ava.

1783
01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.634
SAM: Okay, then where do we go?

1784
01:05:43.634 --> 01:05:44.469
Reani?

1785
01:05:44.469 --> 01:05:47.397
LAURA: You know where the Tumblecarves live?

1786
01:05:47.397 --> 01:05:49.209
MATT: You probably haven't been there,

1787
01:05:49.209 --> 01:05:51.903
but you ask Umi, if you want to,

1788
01:05:51.903 --> 01:05:53.923
and he goes, "If you're looking for them,

1789
01:05:53.923 --> 01:05:56.235
"they're on the Liber Disk.

1790
01:05:56.235 --> 01:05:58.124
"Go for the Demerant Circle."

1791
01:05:59.574 --> 01:06:00.495
SAM: Derp!

1792
01:06:00.495 --> 01:06:02.061
MATT: "There's a bunch of wealthy families

1793
01:06:02.061 --> 01:06:03.086
who live in that space,

1794
01:06:03.086 --> 01:06:05.590
"I'm pretty sure they're about there.

1795
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.882
"(sighs) It's like a three-story home.

1796
01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:12.637
"Back wall shaped like a wedge like the front of a ship.

1797
01:06:12.637 --> 01:06:13.918
"Crystal windows."

1798
01:06:13.918 --> 01:06:17.534
LAURA: Have they got three story balconies?

1799
01:06:17.534 --> 01:06:19.990
SAM: Yep, they've got a balcony that's three stories high.

1800
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:21.400
Single-level house.

1801
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.043
(laughter)

1802
01:06:24.043 --> 01:06:26.154
MATT: Definitely built in the '70s.

1803
01:06:26.154 --> 01:06:28.489
MICA: Shag carpet?
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

1804
01:06:28.489 --> 01:06:31.582
It's got one of those recessed den pits.

1805
01:06:31.582 --> 01:06:34.565
SAM: By the way, Umagorn? Umagorn.

1806
01:06:34.565 --> 01:06:35.411
MATT: "Yeah?"

1807
01:06:35.411 --> 01:06:37.960
SAM: What time is it right now?

1808
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.994
MATT: At this point, you guys have been out for the day,

1809
01:06:39.994 --> 01:06:44.169
you just returned. I'd say it's

1810
01:06:44.169 --> 01:06:45.855
pushing into evening probably,

1811
01:06:45.855 --> 01:06:47.273
especially after you guys have been drinking for a bit,

1812
01:06:47.273 --> 01:06:48.684
it's evening, it's evening.

1813
01:06:48.684 --> 01:06:51.004
MARISHA: Question, has it been the two evenings

1814
01:06:51.004 --> 01:06:55.995
since I talked to Archivist Stars--

1815
01:06:55.995 --> 01:06:57.454
SAM and TALIESIN: Skarsgaard.

1816
01:06:57.454 --> 01:06:59.320
LAURA: Alexander Skarsgaard.

1817
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.761
MARISHA: Demid! Wait. Yes.

1818
01:07:02.761 --> 01:07:05.625
When we talked about meeting up and talking about--

1819
01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:07.620
LAURA: Oh, meeting at the IHOP?

1820
01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.056
MICA: Oh yeah, the Denny's parking lot.

1821
01:07:09.056 --> 01:07:10.945
(laughter)

1822
01:07:10.945 --> 01:07:12.396
MATT: Yes, it would've been two days, because--

1823
01:07:12.396 --> 01:07:13.780
MARISHA: So that's tonight?

1824
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.424
MATT: Because we did say that you guys

1825
01:07:15.424 --> 01:07:16.736
had had a night's rest, though I think

1826
01:07:16.736 --> 01:07:18.193
it may have gotten a little muddled between episodes,

1827
01:07:18.193 --> 01:07:19.440
Because that happens occasionally.

1828
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.073
But before you went to the Mythburrow, exactly,

1829
01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.598
we did say you guys took a full rest beforehand,

1830
01:07:26.598 --> 01:07:28.967
so that would put us at two days.

1831
01:07:28.967 --> 01:07:31.359
MARISHA: So that would be tonight, theoretically,

1832
01:07:31.359 --> 01:07:32.612
that that would be taking place.

1833
01:07:32.612 --> 01:07:34.437
MATT: Yeah, if you wanted to follow up on that.

1834
01:07:34.437 --> 01:07:35.612
MARISHA: If I wanted to do that, okay.

1835
01:07:35.612 --> 01:07:36.833
MATT: Your call.

1836
01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:38.539
MARISHA: All right.

1837
01:07:38.539 --> 01:07:40.680
MICA: Would anybody like to sleep over

1838
01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.968
at my house before we go?

1839
01:07:42.968 --> 01:07:43.801
SAM: Sure.

1840
01:07:43.801 --> 01:07:47.356
MICA: We had a long day, and I can make,

1841
01:07:47.356 --> 01:07:50.397
I don't know, hot chocolate?

1842
01:07:51.247 --> 01:07:53.316
SAM: Can you fit all of us in your--

1843
01:07:53.316 --> 01:07:57.053
MICA: Well, we're going to have to smush,

1844
01:07:57.053 --> 01:08:00.499
and maybe we can all just sleep out in the den,

1845
01:08:00.499 --> 01:08:02.508
and we can light a fire and tell stories.

1846
01:08:02.508 --> 01:08:04.276
LAURA: And build a pillow fort?
MICA: Build a pillow fort!

1847
01:08:04.276 --> 01:08:06.571
But you guys are welcome to stay over

1848
01:08:06.571 --> 01:08:09.387
and then you don't have to pay inn fees.

1849
01:08:09.387 --> 01:08:11.185
LAURA: That's nice.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1850
01:08:11.185 --> 01:08:12.542
TALIESIN: I'm okay with that.

1851
01:08:12.542 --> 01:08:14.214
LAURA: Would we sleep now and then get up like,

1852
01:08:14.214 --> 01:08:16.719
in the middle of the night and go to the Tumblecarves?

1853
01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:20.259
Or are we going to check it out before we go do this?

1854
01:08:20.259 --> 01:08:22.192
LIAM: We should get a look at the place.

1855
01:08:22.192 --> 01:08:23.178
MICA: Check it out first.

1856
01:08:23.178 --> 01:08:24.125
LAURA: Let's walk by there.

1857
01:08:24.125 --> 01:08:25.258
MICA: It's just been a long--

1858
01:08:25.258 --> 01:08:26.641
I know that we had a long journey,

1859
01:08:26.641 --> 01:08:28.563
and if anybody wants to just--

1860
01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:30.383
MATT: It's about a 30 minute walk from where you are.

1861
01:08:30.383 --> 01:08:31.365
SAM: So we could go, come back.

1862
01:08:31.365 --> 01:08:32.231
LAURA: Let's go check it out and then

1863
01:08:32.231 --> 01:08:34.064
go hang out at your house.

1864
01:08:34.064 --> 01:08:35.708
MICA: We can get cupcakes on the way back.

1865
01:08:35.708 --> 01:08:37.125
LAURA: Fuck yeah.

1866
01:08:39.024 --> 01:08:40.895
MATT: All right, so following the instructions,

1867
01:08:40.895 --> 01:08:43.960
you head towards the Demerant Circle in the Liber Disk.

1868
01:08:45.443 --> 01:08:48.786
Looking around, there's a few homesteads

1869
01:08:48.786 --> 01:08:50.555
that definitely stand above and beyond

1870
01:08:50.555 --> 01:08:52.339
the others in the vicinity.

1871
01:08:52.339 --> 01:08:55.342
You see a handful of them that-- it's interesting,

1872
01:08:55.342 --> 01:08:57.649
in this one section amongst the large tunnel

1873
01:08:57.649 --> 01:09:01.804
that forms the auger-like spiral of the entire city,

1874
01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.745
in the Demerant Circle, there is a whole section of the wall

1875
01:09:04.745 --> 01:09:08.147
where you can see tunnels are carved

1876
01:09:08.147 --> 01:09:10.718
into the side with staircases that switch back and up

1877
01:09:10.718 --> 01:09:13.510
and at certain locations there, you can see

1878
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:16.080
elven abodes that are four, five stories

1879
01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.361
that are built into the rock, and because they're built

1880
01:09:18.361 --> 01:09:20.516
into the rock, they're designed in odd shapes

1881
01:09:20.516 --> 01:09:24.133
that shouldn't form a homestead.

1882
01:09:24.133 --> 01:09:28.963
It's almost like-- imagine a Swiss Family Robinson treehouse

1883
01:09:28.963 --> 01:09:31.913
but halfway built into a rock with no tree.

1884
01:09:31.913 --> 01:09:33.755
So there's a number of these,

1885
01:09:33.755 --> 01:09:36.588
and almost like, some of them appear to have been

1886
01:09:36.588 --> 01:09:38.694
competitively designed and expanded

1887
01:09:38.694 --> 01:09:42.151
to try and outdo each other. Those are above.

1888
01:09:42.151 --> 01:09:44.066
On the base floor you can see

1889
01:09:44.066 --> 01:09:47.110
mainly the dwarven estates of the different

1890
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:49.402
noble dwarven families.

1891
01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:52.146
Keeping an eye out past one that has

1892
01:09:52.146 --> 01:09:54.853
its own thickly built subterranean garden

1893
01:09:54.853 --> 01:09:57.695
that is surrounding its home, you do find one area

1894
01:09:57.695 --> 01:10:01.027
where there's an alcove that pushes in

1895
01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:02.859
further than the wall of the cave,

1896
01:10:02.859 --> 01:10:05.725
and there, sitting in that space, you see

1897
01:10:05.725 --> 01:10:09.583
what looks like a wedged-shaped

1898
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.921
three story home, matching the description

1899
01:10:11.921 --> 01:10:13.767
you've been given.

1900
01:10:13.767 --> 01:10:15.600
You can see this wedge as it protrudes

1901
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.168
and meets the front where this alcove begins.

1902
01:10:18.168 --> 01:10:20.072
There are windows and doors on each side

1903
01:10:20.072 --> 01:10:23.616
and there are balconies that are set up on either side,

1904
01:10:23.616 --> 01:10:25.886
the third story balcony itself being

1905
01:10:25.886 --> 01:10:28.540
of the most grandiose of it with chairs set above it,

1906
01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:32.606
and lanterns hanging. The lanterns are currently out.

1907
01:10:32.606 --> 01:10:35.132
There is no light from the interior.

1908
01:10:35.132 --> 01:10:37.229
You do see, in a glance over there,

1909
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:39.574
two guards patrolling

1910
01:10:39.574 --> 01:10:41.768
the exterior of the house.

1911
01:10:41.768 --> 01:10:43.814
Not glassblades. They're not official.

1912
01:10:43.814 --> 01:10:47.091
They look to be privately hired

1913
01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:49.508
to keep an eye on the estate.

1914
01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:53.079
What you do see from the windows,

1915
01:10:53.079 --> 01:10:55.648
the texture is crystalline, not smooth.

1916
01:10:55.648 --> 01:10:58.471
They're almost meant to obfuscate

1917
01:10:58.471 --> 01:11:02.429
any sort of interior imagery.

1918
01:11:02.429 --> 01:11:05.019
The wood frames of the doors and much

1919
01:11:05.019 --> 01:11:07.715
of the structure itself, smooth, well-made.

1920
01:11:07.715 --> 01:11:09.058
Everything here is very beautiful.

1921
01:11:09.058 --> 01:11:11.968
It's not grandiose in size in comparison

1922
01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:14.313
to other homesteads here, but what is there

1923
01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:18.194
looks to be meticulously placed, designed,

1924
01:11:18.194 --> 01:11:22.974
and a lot of care has been taken in the details.

1925
01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:25.481
So, that is what you see before you.

1926
01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:28.989
MICA: Question. Are there any roaming animals?

1927
01:11:28.989 --> 01:11:33.989
Like cats or dogs or birds or goats or...

1928
01:11:34.526 --> 01:11:35.609
TRAVIS: Keep going.

1929
01:11:35.609 --> 01:11:38.359
MICA: Any just animals about? (laughs)

1930
01:11:38.359 --> 01:11:40.581
Giraffes, rhinos.

1931
01:11:40.581 --> 01:11:42.294
MATT: Right, no rhinos.

1932
01:11:42.294 --> 01:11:43.604
MICA: Oh, damn.

1933
01:11:43.604 --> 01:11:45.698
MATT: There are occasionally birds that find their way

1934
01:11:45.698 --> 01:11:47.481
down here, either accidentally,

1935
01:11:47.481 --> 01:11:49.524
and there are a few subterranean birds

1936
01:11:49.524 --> 01:11:54.134
that nest within the city, but they're usually

1937
01:11:54.134 --> 01:11:58.010
on the top side. They're usually hanging up in the--

1938
01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.968
SAM: Volition Disk?

1939
01:11:58.968 --> 01:12:00.523
MATT: The Volition Disk, the top disk.

1940
01:12:00.523 --> 01:12:01.831
MICA: So I don't see any--

1941
01:12:01.831 --> 01:12:03.456
MATT: Not in this area.
LAURA: Mice?

1942
01:12:03.456 --> 01:12:05.384
MATT: There are mice. There's mice, there's rodents,

1943
01:12:05.384 --> 01:12:07.727
oh yeah, there's all sorts of like, voles

1944
01:12:07.727 --> 01:12:11.503
and other sorts of rodent-type creatures that exist,

1945
01:12:11.503 --> 01:12:13.663
both on the natural interior of the city

1946
01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:16.952
and off of whatever scraps fall from people that live here.

1947
01:12:16.952 --> 01:12:20.148
One beautiful thing you do notice about this area, too,

1948
01:12:20.148 --> 01:12:24.110
the stone pillars here that normally hold aloft

1949
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:28.261
the over-arch of the walkway on this end have been

1950
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.505
carved to look like trees.

1951
01:12:30.505 --> 01:12:33.584
They are these thick striations that head up to where,

1952
01:12:33.584 --> 01:12:35.567
as opposed to just these large stone structures.

1953
01:12:35.567 --> 01:12:39.306
Everything here has an extra layer of decor consideration

1954
01:12:39.306 --> 01:12:41.116
to its design and construction.

1955
01:12:41.116 --> 01:12:42.153
SAM: Rainforest Cafe?

1956
01:12:42.153 --> 01:12:43.188
(laughter)

1957
01:12:43.188 --> 01:12:44.059
MATT: Yes, exactly.

1958
01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:45.963
There's an animatronic gorilla who keeps like

1959
01:12:45.963 --> 01:12:48.157
making the same motion.

1960
01:12:48.157 --> 01:12:51.451
You do also see numerous glowing, hanging glass lanterns

1961
01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:54.730
hung amongst a lot of these tree pillars,

1962
01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:57.012
with little arcane firelight motes

1963
01:12:57.012 --> 01:12:58.881
that sparkle around the outside of it.

1964
01:12:58.881 --> 01:13:00.369
LAURA: It looks like ours!

1965
01:13:00.369 --> 01:13:01.328
TALIESIN: It is like ours.

1966
01:13:01.328 --> 01:13:03.132
MATT: Looking straight up at the cavern roof over this area.

1967
01:13:03.132 --> 01:13:06.948
too, it appears to be enchanted or painted.

1968
01:13:06.948 --> 01:13:08.570
You're not quite sure.

1969
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:10.764
For being subterranean, it almost

1970
01:13:10.764 --> 01:13:11.972
looks like a starscape.

1971
01:13:11.972 --> 01:13:14.305
There's thousands of tiny little pin lights

1972
01:13:14.305 --> 01:13:16.212
that flicker in and out.

1973
01:13:16.212 --> 01:13:20.612
This vicinity has been designed to feel like

1974
01:13:20.612 --> 01:13:23.734
you're more outside than the rest of the interior.

1975
01:13:23.734 --> 01:13:25.526
MICA: That's so romantic.

1976
01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:28.444
LIAM: Sorry DM, you said that the Tumblecarves building

1977
01:13:28.444 --> 01:13:30.873
is not built into the wall. It's standalone on its own.

1978
01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:33.404
MATT: It's built into an alcove within the far wall.

1979
01:13:33.404 --> 01:13:35.223
The base of it, yeah.

1980
01:13:35.223 --> 01:13:36.721
LIAM: And the guards, you said they're patrolling.

1981
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:38.254
Are they ground level?

1982
01:13:38.254 --> 01:13:40.198
MATT: level, yeah.

1983
01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:42.642
MICA: And you said the mice that-- are they nearby?

1984
01:13:42.642 --> 01:13:44.378
Like are they by our feet?

1985
01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:46.397
MATT: I mean, there isn't like a perpetual cloud of mice

1986
01:13:46.397 --> 01:13:48.852
around your feet, but mice and rodents

1987
01:13:48.852 --> 01:13:51.357
do live in these areas, so if you were to search for one

1988
01:13:51.357 --> 01:13:54.001
or find a way to try and invoke one, you could probably--

1989
01:13:54.001 --> 01:13:56.205
MICA: May I search for a mouse?

1990
01:13:56.205 --> 01:13:59.324
MATT: Sure, go ahead and roll a perception check for me.

1991
01:13:59.324 --> 01:14:00.945
Or actually, a nature check.

1992
01:14:00.945 --> 01:14:02.459
Actually.

1993
01:14:02.459 --> 01:14:04.156
TRAVIS: All the checks.
MATT: Sorry.

1994
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:07.073
Yes, perception.
MICA: Perception?

1995
01:14:07.073 --> 01:14:08.519
Okay, should I keep that roll?

1996
01:14:08.519 --> 01:14:10.790
MATT: Yeah, keep that one.
MICA: Okay, that was a six.

1997
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:12.702
Six plus eight.
SAM: Oh, wow.

1998
01:14:12.702 --> 01:14:13.684
MICA: 14.
SAM: Damn.

1999
01:14:13.684 --> 01:14:14.821
MATT: 14.

2000
01:14:14.821 --> 01:14:15.843
Okay.

2001
01:14:15.843 --> 01:14:17.688
It takes you a little bit of time,

2002
01:14:17.688 --> 01:14:19.856
but eventually you don't find a mouse,

2003
01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:24.017
you find mouse droppings, which leads you to

2004
01:14:24.017 --> 01:14:27.968
a number of small dug holes nearby the base

2005
01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:31.266
of one of the small guard houses,

2006
01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:32.922
and you can probably tell there are a number of mice

2007
01:14:32.922 --> 01:14:34.779
that live within or underneath this guard house.

2008
01:14:34.779 --> 01:14:35.796
LAURA: What about bats?

2009
01:14:35.796 --> 01:14:37.592
Are there bats down here?

2010
01:14:37.592 --> 01:14:39.959
MATT: Make a perception check.

2011
01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:44.200
LAURA: 17.

2012
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.661
MATT: 17.

2013
01:14:45.661 --> 01:14:47.480
Glancing up amongst the higher area

2014
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.921
of the tree-like pillar and the roof area

2015
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:52.756
where the flickering lights are,

2016
01:14:52.756 --> 01:14:55.935
you glance up and focus with what little light there is

2017
01:14:55.935 --> 01:15:00.660
and you notice there are hundreds upon hundreds of bats

2018
01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:03.725
that are all dangling, that are just now

2019
01:15:03.725 --> 01:15:04.836
starting to wake up.

2020
01:15:04.836 --> 01:15:06.894
You can just barely hear the squeaks

2021
01:15:06.894 --> 01:15:09.872
as it's now pushing into the nocturnal period of the night,

2022
01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:12.421
and the elements of this bat cluster

2023
01:15:12.421 --> 01:15:14.306
are beginning to come to consciousness

2024
01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:16.445
and prepare for the evening's hunt

2025
01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:18.725
within and outside of the city.

2026
01:15:18.725 --> 01:15:20.456
LAURA: How smart were those bats when you were

2027
01:15:20.456 --> 01:15:22.267
talking to them before?

2028
01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:24.491
MICA: Eh, they can get the job done.

2029
01:15:24.491 --> 01:15:26.406
LAURA: Do you think they would, like,

2030
01:15:26.406 --> 01:15:28.424
lose track of what they were doing

2031
01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:29.982
and start eating a curtain?

2032
01:15:29.982 --> 01:15:32.189
MICA: No, I think they'd probably come back

2033
01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:33.834
and then forget whatever they told me,

2034
01:15:33.834 --> 01:15:35.430
but they'd remember enough.

2035
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.102
LAURA: They would remember that they were

2036
01:15:37.102 --> 01:15:38.355
supposed to go do something.
MICA: Yeah.

2037
01:15:38.355 --> 01:15:39.515
LAURA: Okay.

2038
01:15:39.515 --> 01:15:41.914
MICA: I'd like to cast to Speak with Animals.

2039
01:15:41.914 --> 01:15:43.299
MATT: Okay.

2040
01:15:43.299 --> 01:15:47.365
MICA: And are we in sight line of the guards?

2041
01:15:47.365 --> 01:15:50.742
MATT: You're not-- you're not at the gates staring at them.

2042
01:15:50.742 --> 01:15:51.575
MICA: Right.

2043
01:15:51.575 --> 01:15:53.185
MATT: So you look like, you know, some loiterers

2044
01:15:53.185 --> 01:15:54.856
that are just wandering through a richer neighborhood

2045
01:15:54.856 --> 01:15:57.198
than you all should probably be in, by their standards.

2046
01:15:57.198 --> 01:16:01.749
MICA: So I'd like to kind of, hello, bat friends?

2047
01:16:01.749 --> 01:16:02.959
MATT: Okay.

2048
01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:07.409
They're like, over 100 feet above you,

2049
01:16:07.409 --> 01:16:08.832
so a whisper's not going to reach them.

2050
01:16:08.832 --> 01:16:10.374
You have to find some way to--

2051
01:16:10.374 --> 01:16:12.247
MICA: Can someone help me get their attention?

2052
01:16:12.247 --> 01:16:14.224
TALIESIN: I can throw my voice a bit.

2053
01:16:14.224 --> 01:16:15.057
MICA: Yeah.

2054
01:16:15.057 --> 01:16:18.284
LAURA: I can turn into a bat and go talk to them.

2055
01:16:18.284 --> 01:16:19.473
MICA: I can-- oh, I can't.

2056
01:16:19.473 --> 01:16:20.750
SAM: I can throw a bomb.

2057
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:24.145
MICA: No, no, we don't want to hurt our bat friends.

2058
01:16:24.145 --> 01:16:24.978
MATT: You have had a short rest

2059
01:16:24.978 --> 01:16:25.830
while you guys were drinking.

2060
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:26.777
MICA: Oh, we have?

2061
01:16:26.777 --> 01:16:30.943
MATT: Well, you guys spent a good hour or so in that tavern.

2062
01:16:30.943 --> 01:16:33.512
MICA: Then just kidding.

2063
01:16:33.512 --> 01:16:35.841
Why don't we both go up as bats

2064
01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:37.375
and go see if we can get some friends

2065
01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:38.501
and then we can fly into the house

2066
01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:40.727
and see where the ring is?

2067
01:16:40.727 --> 01:16:41.947
LAURA: Okay.

2068
01:16:41.947 --> 01:16:43.209
Do you think they would notice

2069
01:16:43.209 --> 01:16:46.076
that a bunch of bats were in the house?

2070
01:16:46.076 --> 01:16:46.947
MICA: Maybe.

2071
01:16:46.947 --> 01:16:48.398
Hmm, okay, let's think of something--

2072
01:16:48.398 --> 01:16:51.100
LAURA: But what if we were bats.

2073
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:51.975
MICA: Mm-hmm.

2074
01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:54.354
LAURA: Then we went in through-- is there a fireplace,

2075
01:16:54.354 --> 01:16:56.450
is there a chimney on the house?

2076
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:57.559
MATT: No.

2077
01:16:57.559 --> 01:16:58.455
LAURA: Is there--

2078
01:16:58.455 --> 01:17:00.076
MATT: You don't see a chimney, at least.

2079
01:17:00.076 --> 01:17:02.161
Which is generally, I mean some of the buildings

2080
01:17:02.161 --> 01:17:05.777
in this subterranean city

2081
01:17:05.777 --> 01:17:07.910
do have chimneys,

2082
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:09.693
but they don't just open up and then

2083
01:17:09.693 --> 01:17:11.239
fill the interior space with smoke.

2084
01:17:11.239 --> 01:17:15.487
A lot of them seem to, or the places that do have chimneys

2085
01:17:15.487 --> 01:17:17.438
have them built near pillars and then merge

2086
01:17:17.438 --> 01:17:19.328
with the pillars, and you assume the pillars themselves

2087
01:17:19.328 --> 01:17:22.144
probably continue a flue that eventually

2088
01:17:22.144 --> 01:17:24.510
sits outside the mountain, which

2089
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:25.856
now you think about it, when you approached

2090
01:17:25.856 --> 01:17:29.251
the city, you saw a series of these small plumes

2091
01:17:29.251 --> 01:17:30.886
of smoke rising off the mountain.

2092
01:17:30.886 --> 01:17:34.889
Those all appear to be the exits of the gathered

2093
01:17:34.889 --> 01:17:36.767
collective chimneys of the city.

2094
01:17:36.767 --> 01:17:37.879
LAURA: Fucking cool.

2095
01:17:37.879 --> 01:17:39.664
TRAVIS: Going down through a chimney

2096
01:17:39.664 --> 01:17:41.942
and roll the dice on which exit...

2097
01:17:41.942 --> 01:17:43.714
(laughter)

2098
01:17:43.714 --> 01:17:46.219
MATT: Yeah! Party pachinko, let's do this!

2099
01:17:46.219 --> 01:17:47.131
(laughter)

2100
01:17:47.131 --> 01:17:49.243
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

2101
01:17:49.243 --> 01:17:51.433
MARISHA: The windows that you described, they appear to be

2102
01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:54.737
like, embedded stained glass type of thing?

2103
01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:57.986
There's no window entrance or latch?

2104
01:17:57.986 --> 01:18:00.843
MATT: From the ones that you can see at the front,

2105
01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:03.492
make a perception check.
MARISHA: All right.

2106
01:18:03.492 --> 01:18:08.248
LAURA and MICA: (inaudible whispering)

2107
01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:09.537
MARISHA: Okay, 19.

2108
01:18:09.537 --> 01:18:10.370
MATT: 19.

2109
01:18:11.943 --> 01:18:13.815
They do appear to have latches.

2110
01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:14.700
MARISHA: Okay.

2111
01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:17.079
MATT: But they are interior latches.

2112
01:18:17.079 --> 01:18:18.064
MARISHA: Okay.

2113
01:18:18.064 --> 01:18:21.014
MATT: They're latched from the inside and they're basically

2114
01:18:21.014 --> 01:18:23.065
dual windows that open outward,

2115
01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.384
but they are currently closed

2116
01:18:24.384 --> 01:18:25.643
and latched on the other side.

2117
01:18:25.643 --> 01:18:27.714
The windows themselves, it's less like a stained glass,

2118
01:18:27.714 --> 01:18:30.281
like the glass itself is uneven,

2119
01:18:30.281 --> 01:18:35.173
and is developed to look beautifully rough

2120
01:18:35.173 --> 01:18:39.053
and also obfuscates what is on the inside.

2121
01:18:39.053 --> 01:18:40.843
You can see shapes maybe from the inside.

2122
01:18:40.843 --> 01:18:42.476
MARISHA: Shower glass.
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

2123
01:18:42.476 --> 01:18:45.145
TALIESIN: How far away we away from the house right now

2124
01:18:45.145 --> 01:18:46.530
in number of feet, like--

2125
01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:47.364
MATT: At this moment?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2126
01:18:47.364 --> 01:18:48.846
MATT: You're probably about 150 feet away.

2127
01:18:48.846 --> 01:18:49.679
TALIESIN: All right.

2128
01:18:49.679 --> 01:18:50.968
LAURA: Let's hide and turn into bats.

2129
01:18:50.968 --> 01:18:52.227
MICA: I like this idea.

2130
01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.411
LAURA: Hey Caleb.

2131
01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:55.154
Caleb, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb.

2132
01:18:55.154 --> 01:18:56.602
Do you want to hide and turn into a bat with us

2133
01:18:56.602 --> 01:18:58.539
and we can all go look in the windows?

2134
01:18:58.539 --> 01:19:00.484
LIAM: They are very slow creatures.

2135
01:19:00.484 --> 01:19:01.954
Not slow, but slow.

2136
01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.899
LAURA: I'm just saying to fly. I don't want to go

2137
01:19:03.899 --> 01:19:05.721
in there right now. We just want to, you know,

2138
01:19:05.721 --> 01:19:07.714
check out the house around to see

2139
01:19:07.714 --> 01:19:09.735
if there are any openings on the back side of it.

2140
01:19:09.735 --> 01:19:13.902
TRAVIS: Just to bring up the old shit,

2141
01:19:13.902 --> 01:19:17.305
you've been a bat before and it went piss sideways.

2142
01:19:17.305 --> 01:19:18.948
SAM: That was a moth. That was a moth.

2143
01:19:18.948 --> 01:19:20.556
TRAVIS: Right, sorry, they're all the same to me, okay.

2144
01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:23.819
LAURA: No, actually, I think we were bats at one point, too.

2145
01:19:23.819 --> 01:19:25.970
TRAVIS: I thought it was outside of the hobgoblin

2146
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.663
with the sword and then the bat--

2147
01:19:27.663 --> 01:19:28.535
LAURA: No, that was a moth.

2148
01:19:28.535 --> 01:19:29.571
MICA: Didn't you turn into a bat?

2149
01:19:29.571 --> 01:19:30.450
LAURA: No no no.

2150
01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:32.526
MICA: My bat friends helped us with the dragons.

2151
01:19:32.526 --> 01:19:34.272
MARISHA: We were bats in campaign one.

2152
01:19:34.272 --> 01:19:35.557
LAURA: That's what it was.

2153
01:19:35.557 --> 01:19:36.696
(laughter)

2154
01:19:36.696 --> 01:19:38.691
SAM: We've had good recent experience with bats.

2155
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:41.807
MICA: So what if we turn into bats and we go talk to those

2156
01:19:41.807 --> 01:19:44.482
bats, those bats can help us, and then collectively

2157
01:19:44.482 --> 01:19:47.612
we all as a bat family go and look in windows

2158
01:19:47.612 --> 01:19:49.832
and there's power in numbers.

2159
01:19:49.832 --> 01:19:52.636
LAURA: Or, what if-- I also have an idea.

2160
01:19:52.636 --> 01:19:54.605
What if we just turn into a few bats.

2161
01:19:54.605 --> 01:19:55.591
MICA: Okay.

2162
01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:57.748
LAURA: Go check out around the house, see if there's any way

2163
01:19:57.748 --> 01:19:59.581
we can sneak.
MICA: Can do.

2164
01:20:01.073 --> 01:20:04.920
LAURA: I can turn out of a bat and paint a doorway.

2165
01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.438
MICA and SAM: (gasping)

2166
01:20:07.438 --> 01:20:09.943
TRAVIS: Also, I do--
SAM: Are we doing this tonight?

2167
01:20:09.943 --> 01:20:10.981
TALIESIN: No, tomorrow.

2168
01:20:10.981 --> 01:20:13.223
TRAVIS: I do have a very rare item that allows you

2169
01:20:13.223 --> 01:20:15.645
to stick a dagger in a keyhole, turn it,

2170
01:20:15.645 --> 01:20:18.133
and it locks the door and nothing else can open the door

2171
01:20:18.133 --> 01:20:20.267
except for the dagger you all gave to me.

2172
01:20:20.267 --> 01:20:21.775
SAM: So the guards couldn't come in.

2173
01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:22.883
TRAVIS: Right.

2174
01:20:22.883 --> 01:20:26.333
MICA: Unless they set the door on fire.

2175
01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:27.995
SAM: Well, they would have to step through then.

2176
01:20:27.995 --> 01:20:30.613
LAURA: They'd have to-- in order to set the door on fire,

2177
01:20:30.613 --> 01:20:32.754
they'd have to set the whole house on fire.

2178
01:20:32.754 --> 01:20:34.471
SAM: That seems--

2179
01:20:34.471 --> 01:20:36.596
TALIESIN: Counterproductive, really, in the end.

2180
01:20:36.596 --> 01:20:38.815
MARISHA: Do we want to do a stakeout and see if we can see

2181
01:20:38.815 --> 01:20:41.621
the Tumblecarves entering and exiting?

2182
01:20:41.621 --> 01:20:44.254
LAURA: We should just do a little stakeout right now.

2183
01:20:44.254 --> 01:20:47.210
Don't go in and-- we do this all the time.

2184
01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:48.599
We're <i>not</i> going to go in.

2185
01:20:48.599 --> 01:20:50.354
SAM: I'm going to turn invisible.

2186
01:20:50.354 --> 01:20:53.370
(laughter)

2187
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:54.301
MATT: This is going to be great.
LAURA: I do think

2188
01:20:54.301 --> 01:20:55.315
we just turn into bats

2189
01:20:55.315 --> 01:20:56.452
and just go see what we see.

2190
01:20:56.452 --> 01:20:59.217
LIAM: Yeah, step one, we bat around and get

2191
01:20:59.217 --> 01:21:01.793
the lay of the land here for this building.

2192
01:21:01.793 --> 01:21:03.588
LAURA: Do bats have bad vision?

2193
01:21:03.588 --> 01:21:06.386
SAM: No, they have no vision. They hear things.

2194
01:21:06.386 --> 01:21:07.219
MATT: Echolocation.

2195
01:21:07.219 --> 01:21:08.673
LAURA: Oh, well, maybe bats--

2196
01:21:08.673 --> 01:21:11.781
MATT: Which is fine, they can see. Echolocation is--

2197
01:21:11.781 --> 01:21:13.575
TALIESIN: They can see.

2198
01:21:13.575 --> 01:21:15.595
SAM: Don't sight shame bats.

2199
01:21:15.595 --> 01:21:17.324
MATT: Yeah, they get around just fine.

2200
01:21:17.324 --> 01:21:18.344
TALIESIN: They're good.

2201
01:21:18.344 --> 01:21:19.945
LAURA: Okay, okay, let's do it.

2202
01:21:19.945 --> 01:21:21.896
LIAM: So that's step one and then step two is we need to

2203
01:21:21.896 --> 01:21:24.501
watch this place for a considerable amount of time.

2204
01:21:24.501 --> 01:21:28.592
MARISHA: Fjord and I and Caduceus will start the watching.

2205
01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.515
LAURA: We will turn into bats, and then

2206
01:21:30.515 --> 01:21:32.350
what are you going to do, Nott?

2207
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:33.726
SAM: Whatever you want me to do.

2208
01:21:33.726 --> 01:21:35.876
Do you want me to be a support?

2209
01:21:35.876 --> 01:21:38.753
Do you want me to be invisible in case you fall

2210
01:21:38.753 --> 01:21:39.948
and I can catch you?

2211
01:21:39.948 --> 01:21:41.635
I don't know, what do you want me to do?

2212
01:21:41.635 --> 01:21:43.240
LAURA: No, just stay here with everybody.

2213
01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.597
SAM: All right, I'll just stay here.

2214
01:21:44.597 --> 01:21:46.380
(laughter)

2215
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.388
MARISHA: It's fun being a lookout.

2216
01:21:48.388 --> 01:21:49.348
SAM: Is it?

2217
01:21:49.348 --> 01:21:50.181
MARISHA: No.

2218
01:21:50.181 --> 01:21:51.466
(laughter)

2219
01:21:51.466 --> 01:21:53.130
SAM: I'll probably say I'll stay here

2220
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:55.239
and then I'll just go in anyway.

2221
01:21:55.239 --> 01:21:56.303
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Classic.

2222
01:21:56.303 --> 01:21:57.962
LIAM: I set Frumpkin on her shoulders.

2223
01:21:57.962 --> 01:21:59.697
MARISHA: Classic Nott. Classic Nott.

2224
01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:02.589
LIAM: And smile at Nott and then think telepathically

2225
01:22:02.589 --> 01:22:05.551
to Frumpkin: Keep an eye on her.

2226
01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:06.565
SAM: On me?

2227
01:22:06.565 --> 01:22:08.175
LIAM: You didn't hear anything.
SAM: Oh.

2228
01:22:08.175 --> 01:22:09.756
(laughter)

2229
01:22:09.756 --> 01:22:14.756
LIAM: Then I cast Fortune's Favor on the bat squad.

2230
01:22:14.771 --> 01:22:16.577
One, two, three.

2231
01:22:16.577 --> 01:22:18.143
MATT: All right.

2232
01:22:18.143 --> 01:22:19.781
TRAVIS: (whispers) Bat Squad.

2233
01:22:19.781 --> 01:22:22.480
MATT: Okay, so you each have one reroll for the next hour.

2234
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.130
LAURA: Awesome.

2235
01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:25.564
MATT: So, what are you doing?

2236
01:22:25.564 --> 01:22:27.461
LAURA: We're going to hide.

2237
01:22:27.461 --> 01:22:28.871
MATT: All three of you?

2238
01:22:28.871 --> 01:22:30.279
LAURA: No, Caleb--

2239
01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:32.375
SAM: All of us are going to hide across the street, right?

2240
01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:33.888
LAURA: Well, ish, look chill, but--

2241
01:22:33.888 --> 01:22:37.238
MATT: So you guys keep low-key, like a couple of

2242
01:22:37.238 --> 01:22:39.621
high schoolers hanging outside of a Ross parking lot

2243
01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:42.538
at like 2AM, totally inconspicuous.

2244
01:22:42.538 --> 01:22:44.773
LAURA: Is it around 2AM?

2245
01:22:44.773 --> 01:22:46.193
MATT: No no no.

2246
01:22:46.193 --> 01:22:47.882
You're in the cusp of the evening.

2247
01:22:47.882 --> 01:22:49.009
You've just now gotten to the night,

2248
01:22:49.009 --> 01:22:51.049
so it's like the equivalent of 8:30, 9PM.

2249
01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:53.093
LAURA: So maybe let's wait until all the bats

2250
01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:55.608
start to really wake up, and then we'll do it,

2251
01:22:55.608 --> 01:22:56.828
so it makes it normal.

2252
01:22:56.828 --> 01:22:58.773
TALIESIN: Is there anywhere for us to watch the house

2253
01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:01.373
that is not terribly conspicuous?

2254
01:23:01.373 --> 01:23:02.589
MATT: Right. Actually, it'd probably be a little bit

2255
01:23:02.589 --> 01:23:06.205
earlier because you guys did sleep in the dragon's...

2256
01:23:06.205 --> 01:23:08.635
in Mythburrow before going into the chaos,

2257
01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:11.813
so after coming back about midday, drinking,

2258
01:23:11.813 --> 01:23:15.865
you're still pre-dusk. Still relatively early, actually.

2259
01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:17.957
LAURA: Oh, okay.
MATT: Comparatively.

2260
01:23:17.957 --> 01:23:20.633
LAURA: So there are no bats flying around now or there are--

2261
01:23:20.633 --> 01:23:23.063
MATT: They're starting to. It's getting towards dusk.

2262
01:23:23.063 --> 01:23:23.896
LAURA: Okay.

2263
01:23:23.896 --> 01:23:24.770
MATT: I'm no changing that on you.

2264
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:25.744
LAURA: Okay.

2265
01:23:25.744 --> 01:23:26.740
MICA: Question.
MATT: Yes.

2266
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:29.220
MICA: Bat intelligence, are they smart enough

2267
01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.685
if we were to ask them to do a thing,

2268
01:23:31.685 --> 01:23:34.089
they would remember to do that thing?

2269
01:23:34.089 --> 01:23:36.753
MATT: Maybe. It depends how complicated the ask is.

2270
01:23:36.753 --> 01:23:37.586
MICA: Okay.

2271
01:23:37.586 --> 01:23:38.986
MATT: You know, they're creatures.

2272
01:23:38.986 --> 01:23:41.536
They aren't extremely stupid.

2273
01:23:41.536 --> 01:23:42.618
MICA: Right.

2274
01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:44.125
It's not a worm.

2275
01:23:44.125 --> 01:23:46.060
MATT: But complicated things might--

2276
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:47.662
MICA: A simple request may.

2277
01:23:47.662 --> 01:23:49.901
MATT: Possibly, if it wants to.

2278
01:23:49.901 --> 01:23:50.734
MICA: Fuck.

2279
01:23:51.584 --> 01:23:52.912
TRAVIS: Great odds.

2280
01:23:52.912 --> 01:23:53.952
Stoked to do it.

2281
01:23:53.952 --> 01:23:54.824
MARISHA: Yeah.

2282
01:23:54.824 --> 01:23:58.990
To Caduceus's question though, is there like a

2283
01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:03.290
rooftop or shady alleyway, or--

2284
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:04.779
TALIESIN: Park with a bench.

2285
01:24:04.779 --> 01:24:06.722
MARISHA: Yeah, some place that looks like we could

2286
01:24:06.722 --> 01:24:08.912
sit and be inconspicuous and watch?

2287
01:24:08.912 --> 01:24:13.070
MATT: There is a subterranean

2288
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:15.436
park at one of the road--

2289
01:24:15.436 --> 01:24:17.089
the cross-section of one of the nearby

2290
01:24:17.089 --> 01:24:19.474
neighborhood roads where you can see in the center there,

2291
01:24:19.474 --> 01:24:22.537
there is a small circle that has two stone benches,

2292
01:24:23.821 --> 01:24:25.945
two leafless trees that upon approaching,

2293
01:24:25.945 --> 01:24:30.161
you see are actually carved. They're carved of marble,

2294
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:32.636
and it looks like branches, but they're smooth

2295
01:24:32.636 --> 01:24:33.657
and they bend and wind.

2296
01:24:33.657 --> 01:24:34.532
It's a really beautiful art piece

2297
01:24:34.532 --> 01:24:36.392
that sits there in the center.

2298
01:24:36.392 --> 01:24:39.578
So it's like a little fake garden sitting space.

2299
01:24:39.578 --> 01:24:40.411
It's nice.

2300
01:24:40.411 --> 01:24:42.051
MARISHA: We have a pretty good view of the gate

2301
01:24:42.051 --> 01:24:43.738
and the Tumblecarves' estate from there?

2302
01:24:43.738 --> 01:24:46.360
MATT: It's about 150, 200 feet away from you,

2303
01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.971
so it's a distance. You can see it,

2304
01:24:48.971 --> 01:24:52.159
but you don't have an amazing view of it

2305
01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:53.432
to remain inconspicuous.

2306
01:24:53.432 --> 01:24:54.976
TALIESIN: If something happens, we'll just

2307
01:24:54.976 --> 01:24:56.846
get up and walk that direction anyway. Keep going.

2308
01:24:56.846 --> 01:24:57.870
MARISHA: Okay.

2309
01:24:57.870 --> 01:24:59.049
MATT: Okay.

2310
01:24:59.049 --> 01:24:59.882
Cool.

2311
01:24:59.882 --> 01:25:00.964
So you guys go ahead and situate yourself there?

2312
01:25:00.964 --> 01:25:02.205
TALIESIN: Hmm.

2313
01:25:02.205 --> 01:25:04.259
MARISHA: Yeah, on the--
TALIESIN: Feed some birds.

2314
01:25:04.259 --> 01:25:05.365
MARISHA: On the edge.

2315
01:25:05.365 --> 01:25:06.590
SAM: I'm going to practice my ollies,

2316
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:08.373
if we're going to be teenagers in the Ralph's.

2317
01:25:08.373 --> 01:25:10.677
(laughter)

2318
01:25:10.677 --> 01:25:12.931
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: Perfect.

2319
01:25:12.931 --> 01:25:15.336
Practice that butterfly knife you bought off Ebay?

2320
01:25:15.336 --> 01:25:16.896
TALIESIN: Whoa, bring it back.

2321
01:25:16.896 --> 01:25:18.351
MICA: Only if it's a rainbow butterfly knife,

2322
01:25:18.351 --> 01:25:19.623
like one of those horrible metals.

2323
01:25:19.623 --> 01:25:20.969
MATT: Oh yeah.

2324
01:25:20.969 --> 01:25:22.077
MATT: What were you saying?
MARISHA: We're watching.

2325
01:25:22.077 --> 01:25:22.910
TRAVIS: Ashley'll learn you some

2326
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:23.743
butterfly knife.
LIAM: Yeah, that is an insult

2327
01:25:23.743 --> 01:25:24.976
to Ashley Johnson.

2328
01:25:24.976 --> 01:25:28.467
MATT: Ashley Johnson, world's best secret badass, man.

2329
01:25:28.467 --> 01:25:30.895
She will cut a bitch.

2330
01:25:30.895 --> 01:25:33.999
All right, so, you guys arrange yourself inconspicuously

2331
01:25:33.999 --> 01:25:38.184
at the crossroad little courtyard space.

2332
01:25:38.184 --> 01:25:40.979
The rest of you are becoming bats.

2333
01:25:40.979 --> 01:25:42.524
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: Out of sight.

2334
01:25:42.524 --> 01:25:43.543
MATT: All right.

2335
01:25:43.543 --> 01:25:44.426
SAM: Caduceus, are you becoming

2336
01:25:44.426 --> 01:25:45.268
a bat?
TALIESIN: No, I'm just

2337
01:25:45.268 --> 01:25:47.384
making the bat hands.

2338
01:25:47.384 --> 01:25:49.005
MATT: He wants to feel involved.

2339
01:25:49.005 --> 01:25:51.507
LAURA: Okay, no, they're real stupid. Okay.

2340
01:25:51.507 --> 01:25:55.591
I was like, I put it in Wild Shape by mistake, so no.

2341
01:25:55.591 --> 01:25:58.273
MATT: Yeah, so (popping).

2342
01:25:58.273 --> 01:26:00.041
You are three bats.

2343
01:26:00.041 --> 01:26:02.685
(squeaking)

2344
01:26:02.685 --> 01:26:04.720
Making your way.

2345
01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:07.105
(flapping)

2346
01:26:07.105 --> 01:26:08.987
All right, what are you doing as bats?

2347
01:26:08.987 --> 01:26:11.347
LAURA: As bats, we're going to fly over to the house--

2348
01:26:11.347 --> 01:26:13.350
MATT: You maintain your full intellect as well.

2349
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:14.923
LAURA: Yeah, we're real dumb.

2350
01:26:14.923 --> 01:26:16.792
MATT: Your mental scores remain the same in animal form

2351
01:26:16.792 --> 01:26:17.845
because of Wild Shape.

2352
01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:19.998
MICA: Can I speak to other bats as a bat?

2353
01:26:19.998 --> 01:26:21.495
MATT: Well, you cast Speak With Animals.
MICA: I did cast Speak With Animals.

2354
01:26:21.495 --> 01:26:22.328
MATT: So you still have that, yeah.

2355
01:26:22.328 --> 01:26:23.731
MICA: So before we go over, I'd like to

2356
01:26:23.731 --> 01:26:27.525
fly up to the bunch and see if there are any awake.

2357
01:26:27.525 --> 01:26:30.091
MATT: There are. They're waking up, and

2358
01:26:30.091 --> 01:26:31.849
the equivalent of what you hear is like,

2359
01:26:31.849 --> 01:26:34.040
(as Bat 1) "Oh man, I'm hungry. Breakfast anyone?"

2360
01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.742
(as Bat 2) "Yeah, let's get breakfast."

2361
01:26:35.742 --> 01:26:37.601
(as Bat 1) "All right, Steve, you okay?"

2362
01:26:37.601 --> 01:26:39.159
(as Steve Bat) "I'm still groggy."

2363
01:26:39.159 --> 01:26:41.172
Like they're just, they're getting out

2364
01:26:41.172 --> 01:26:43.102
of their long night's sleep and they're starting

2365
01:26:43.102 --> 01:26:44.272
to get that stomach rumble.

2366
01:26:44.272 --> 01:26:45.555
TALIESIN: Disney bats.

2367
01:26:45.555 --> 01:26:46.388
MATT: Yep.

2368
01:26:46.388 --> 01:26:49.433
MICA: I go, hello, friends.

2369
01:26:49.433 --> 01:26:52.593
MATT: (as various bats) "Hello," "Hello," "Hello," "Hello."

2370
01:26:52.593 --> 01:26:55.158
MICA: I have a quick question for everybody

2371
01:26:55.158 --> 01:26:56.587
who's awake currently.

2372
01:26:56.587 --> 01:26:58.338
MATT: "Slow down, what was that?"

2373
01:26:58.338 --> 01:27:00.526
MICA: Oh, sorry, I have a question.

2374
01:27:00.526 --> 01:27:02.759
MATT: "Okay."
TRAVIS: Get the fuck outta here.

2375
01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:06.942
MICA: Do you know anything about the people

2376
01:27:06.942 --> 01:27:08.775
who live in the house?

2377
01:27:09.922 --> 01:27:11.153
MATT: "No?"

2378
01:27:11.153 --> 01:27:13.036
MICA: No?
TRAVIS: Shit.

2379
01:27:13.036 --> 01:27:16.973
MICA: Have you seen people leave recently?

2380
01:27:16.973 --> 01:27:18.856
MATT: "Uh.

2381
01:27:18.856 --> 01:27:22.517
"I mean, there have been a few days."

2382
01:27:22.517 --> 01:27:23.350
MICA: Oh.

2383
01:27:25.493 --> 01:27:28.076
If I brought you back food later,

2384
01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:31.444
could you help me with something?

2385
01:27:31.444 --> 01:27:33.169
MATT: "Maybe?"

2386
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:34.943
(laughter)

2387
01:27:34.943 --> 01:27:37.586
The other guy's like, "What food?"

2388
01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:39.836
(laughter)

2389
01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:43.293
MICA: Do you like bread?

2390
01:27:43.293 --> 01:27:45.579
LAURA: I like bread.

2391
01:27:45.579 --> 01:27:47.256
MATT: They both look at each other and hear that and go,

2392
01:27:47.256 --> 01:27:48.845
"I like bread," "I like bread."

2393
01:27:48.845 --> 01:27:52.655
They seem to be more interested in chiming in as a group

2394
01:27:52.655 --> 01:27:55.710
than actually considering how much they like bread.

2395
01:27:55.710 --> 01:27:59.585
MICA: I bring you lots of bread

2396
01:27:59.585 --> 01:28:03.420
for a favor.

2397
01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:07.009
MATT: "Okay," "Okay," "Oh-kay."

2398
01:28:07.009 --> 01:28:12.009
MICA: My friends and I are going to go into the house.

2399
01:28:12.274 --> 01:28:15.599
If anything looks bad,

2400
01:28:15.599 --> 01:28:18.965
like not them come in,

2401
01:28:18.965 --> 01:28:20.490
squeak loud.

2402
01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:22.636
(laughter)

2403
01:28:22.636 --> 01:28:24.230
TALIESIN: Or forever hold your peace.

2404
01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:26.031
MICA: And then you get bread.

2405
01:28:26.031 --> 01:28:27.981
LAURA: I like bread.

2406
01:28:27.981 --> 01:28:29.489
MATT: "I like bread," "I like bread," "I like bread,"

2407
01:28:29.489 --> 01:28:30.839
"I like bread."

2408
01:28:30.839 --> 01:28:32.100
Make a persuasion check.

2409
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.047
MICA: Fuck!
(laughter)

2410
01:28:34.047 --> 01:28:35.647
TALIESIN: I feel like advantage with a rube,

2411
01:28:35.647 --> 01:28:37.119
you have a rube here.

2412
01:28:37.119 --> 01:28:38.453
MATT: Sure, I'll give you advantage, why not.

2413
01:28:38.453 --> 01:28:40.970
MICA: Oh, thank fuck.

2414
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:42.571
Mm, that one's better.

2415
01:28:42.571 --> 01:28:44.766
Wait, what'd you say, persuasion?

2416
01:28:44.766 --> 01:28:46.315
12?

2417
01:28:46.315 --> 01:28:47.156
MATT: 12?

2418
01:28:47.156 --> 01:28:48.029
LAURA: Oh yeah, you could--

2419
01:28:48.029 --> 01:28:49.722
LIAM: You got a third reroll if you really need it.

2420
01:28:49.722 --> 01:28:50.893
LAURA: -- third reroll if you wanted to use it.

2421
01:28:50.893 --> 01:28:52.213
MATT: It's up to you, or you could save it.
LIAM: Fortune's Favor.

2422
01:28:52.213 --> 01:28:53.496
TRAVIS: Save it.

2423
01:28:53.496 --> 01:28:55.263
MICA: I'm going to use the pink one.

2424
01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:58.013
TRAVIS: It's bats, it's bats!
MATT: All right, she's using it.

2425
01:28:58.013 --> 01:28:59.617
MICA: Ooh!

2426
01:28:59.617 --> 01:29:01.125
13.

2427
01:29:01.125 --> 01:29:03.562
MATT: Okay, all right, hell yeah.

2428
01:29:03.562 --> 01:29:05.343
MICA: Oh, he said hell yeah.

2429
01:29:05.343 --> 01:29:06.383
MATT: Hell yeah!

2430
01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:09.610
You just, you concentrate for a second as you stare at them

2431
01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:11.874
and you watch this small little poof of gray energy

2432
01:29:11.874 --> 01:29:15.018
(poofs) as the fragment of possibility,

2433
01:29:15.018 --> 01:29:19.169
time-space bends briefly, magic that shifts

2434
01:29:19.169 --> 01:29:20.972
the very fabric of the cosmos.

2435
01:29:20.972 --> 01:29:22.139
(laughter)

2436
01:29:22.139 --> 01:29:23.111
TRAVIS: It's expended.

2437
01:29:23.111 --> 01:29:24.076
MATT: And you add a wink.

2438
01:29:24.076 --> 01:29:25.151
(laughter)

2439
01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:28.509
The bats go, "Sure, right?" "Yeah."

2440
01:29:28.509 --> 01:29:31.521
"Yeah," "Okay, yeah, yeah."
TRAVIS: Good use.

2441
01:29:31.521 --> 01:29:33.112
SAM: I like bread.
MICA: Yeah.

2442
01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:33.945
LAURA: I like bread.

2443
01:29:33.945 --> 01:29:35.076
MATT: "I like bread," "I like bread."

2444
01:29:35.076 --> 01:29:37.637
TALIESIN: Nature is topsy turvy to convince

2445
01:29:37.637 --> 01:29:39.727
a bunch of bats to eat carbs.

2446
01:29:39.727 --> 01:29:40.970
MATT: Yep.
MICA: Thank you.

2447
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:42.590
MATT: Fucking up their paleo diet.

2448
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:43.719
MICA: Damn.

2449
01:29:43.719 --> 01:29:45.522
Sorry, it's cheat day.

2450
01:29:45.522 --> 01:29:46.931
You're welcome to the bread.

2451
01:29:46.931 --> 01:29:47.772
There you go.

2452
01:29:47.772 --> 01:29:50.320
MICA: I just say: Thank you, friends.

2453
01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:53.706
The bread will come later.

2454
01:29:53.706 --> 01:29:56.922
MATT: "Okay," "Okay," "Okay," "Bread."

2455
01:29:56.922 --> 01:30:00.146
MICA: And then I fly back to Jester.

2456
01:30:00.146 --> 01:30:01.417
LAURA: I was hanging out there with you.

2457
01:30:01.417 --> 01:30:03.688
MICA: Oh, you were? Okay. I gotcha, I gotcha.

2458
01:30:03.688 --> 01:30:05.128
MATT: You go to join them and realize that they're both

2459
01:30:05.128 --> 01:30:07.047
joining you, and you circle for a minute.

2460
01:30:07.047 --> 01:30:10.919
MICA: Oh my god, oh, right, bats.
LAURA: Hi.

2461
01:30:10.919 --> 01:30:12.025
LIAM: Do you think that the three of us

2462
01:30:12.025 --> 01:30:14.070
could have some of the bread now?

2463
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:15.333
MICA: I don't have any bread on me.

2464
01:30:15.333 --> 01:30:16.732
LAURA: Oh, but you promised bread.

2465
01:30:16.732 --> 01:30:18.055
MICA: Bread after.

2466
01:30:18.055 --> 01:30:19.521
(laughter)

2467
01:30:19.521 --> 01:30:21.239
LIAM: Where are you keeping the bread?

2468
01:30:21.239 --> 01:30:24.019
MICA: Oh god, are they just as dumb as bats?

2469
01:30:24.019 --> 01:30:27.237
MATT: Well, you still have your personalities,

2470
01:30:27.237 --> 01:30:30.956
you still-- it's not quite a moth scenario here.

2471
01:30:30.956 --> 01:30:33.790
You have enough intellect to like,

2472
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:36.867
to know how to recall basic elements of your goals.

2473
01:30:36.867 --> 01:30:39.103
LIAM: Yeah, I'm smart enough to ask where the bread is.

2474
01:30:39.103 --> 01:30:40.293
MICA: That's valid.

2475
01:30:40.293 --> 01:30:42.272
MATT: Valid point.

2476
01:30:42.272 --> 01:30:43.735
LAURA: Should we go do something?

2477
01:30:43.735 --> 01:30:44.743
MICA: We look in the windows.

2478
01:30:44.743 --> 01:30:46.846
LIAM: We're looking at the building.
LAURA: Okay.

2479
01:30:46.846 --> 01:30:48.968
LIAM: And looking for bread, let's go.

2480
01:30:48.968 --> 01:30:52.442
SAM: [inaudible]

2481
01:30:52.442 --> 01:30:54.644
MATT: You all make your way down to the house.

2482
01:30:54.644 --> 01:30:57.876
There are the three stories, there's a balcony each story,

2483
01:30:57.876 --> 01:31:00.679
there's the top story is the larger balconies.

2484
01:31:00.679 --> 01:31:02.143
Where are you going?

2485
01:31:02.143 --> 01:31:05.835
MICA: I'm going to go on the topmost floor.

2486
01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:07.492
LAURA: I'm going to fly around the back of the house

2487
01:31:07.492 --> 01:31:09.918
and see what's going on back there.

2488
01:31:09.918 --> 01:31:12.185
LIAM: I'm going to go to the roof and look for bread.

2489
01:31:12.185 --> 01:31:13.201
MATT: Okay.
MICA: Oh no.

2490
01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:16.052
MATT: Perception check, perception check,

2491
01:31:16.052 --> 01:31:18.783
Investigation check, using the bat's--

2492
01:31:18.783 --> 01:31:19.673
LIAM: I'm not Caleb.

2493
01:31:19.673 --> 01:31:21.416
MICA: Oh yeah, the bat's-- fuck.

2494
01:31:21.416 --> 01:31:22.870
MATT: Well, you use your perception.

2495
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:24.952
Well no, use your wisdom plus the bat's.

2496
01:31:24.952 --> 01:31:27.279
MICA: It says perception, plus eight.

2497
01:31:27.279 --> 01:31:29.409
MATT: Sure, we'll go with that.
LAURA: We use wisdom?

2498
01:31:29.409 --> 01:31:31.046
MATT: Use the bat's wisdom, yeah.
MICA: 13.

2499
01:31:31.046 --> 01:31:32.746
MATT: 13, okay.

2500
01:31:33.723 --> 01:31:35.410
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2501
01:31:35.410 --> 01:31:36.676
LAURA: 13.

2502
01:31:37.734 --> 01:31:39.562
LIAM: Do we have a bonus?
LAURA: Plus one.

2503
01:31:39.562 --> 01:31:41.121
LIAM: Plus one? 12.

2504
01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:42.522
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Pretty good.

2505
01:31:42.522 --> 01:31:45.966
MATT: You, Jester, look around the top area

2506
01:31:45.966 --> 01:31:48.836
around the back of it, and the building is built

2507
01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:52.326
up against the interior of the alcove.

2508
01:31:52.326 --> 01:31:56.355
So there is no back end. It's merged with the wall.

2509
01:31:56.355 --> 01:31:58.477
You also see no other entrance on the side,

2510
01:31:58.477 --> 01:32:00.863
and you go over the other side.

2511
01:32:00.863 --> 01:32:03.188
No other doorway, there are the windows on the balconies,

2512
01:32:03.188 --> 01:32:04.422
and there's the front door, and it appears

2513
01:32:04.422 --> 01:32:06.271
that those are the only ways in.

2514
01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:10.027
You glance within the top balcony,

2515
01:32:10.027 --> 01:32:14.069
and you can see there is-- that window,

2516
01:32:14.069 --> 01:32:16.958
what you thought was a window up close you can see

2517
01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:19.503
is a window that splits into a door.

2518
01:32:19.503 --> 01:32:21.138
So it's like three panes of glass.

2519
01:32:21.138 --> 01:32:23.248
Two that are, you know, about that big

2520
01:32:23.248 --> 01:32:26.384
and about dwarven height or so,

2521
01:32:26.384 --> 01:32:28.909
and then the center pane is an actual glass doorway

2522
01:32:28.909 --> 01:32:30.828
with a handle on it.

2523
01:32:30.828 --> 01:32:32.504
MICA: Can I see through the glass?

2524
01:32:32.504 --> 01:32:34.036
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

2525
01:32:34.036 --> 01:32:36.287
With no interior light,

2526
01:32:36.287 --> 01:32:38.691
and the way that the panes are refracting,

2527
01:32:38.691 --> 01:32:41.578
you can't make out any details with a perception roll of 13.

2528
01:32:41.578 --> 01:32:44.107
LAURA: On the roof, since it's in an alcove,

2529
01:32:44.107 --> 01:32:47.470
can the elven houses see down to the roof,

2530
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:50.004
or is it protected, is it like inside--

2531
01:32:50.004 --> 01:32:52.430
MATT: You can see there's maybe one with a view of here,

2532
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:54.834
but that's further out, because it's mostly protected,

2533
01:32:54.834 --> 01:32:58.002
it cuts off the perspective of any of the higher houses,

2534
01:32:58.002 --> 01:32:59.811
other than the ones that are more

2535
01:32:59.811 --> 01:33:01.449
affixed to the far pillars.

2536
01:33:01.449 --> 01:33:04.452
LAURA: Okay, and then how much of a distance is it

2537
01:33:04.452 --> 01:33:06.466
from the ceiling to the roof?

2538
01:33:06.466 --> 01:33:08.948
MATT: It's maybe 15, 10 feet.

2539
01:33:08.948 --> 01:33:10.723
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Not a wide gap,

2540
01:33:10.723 --> 01:33:11.647
but a little bit of space.

2541
01:33:11.647 --> 01:33:12.887
LAURA: Okay.

2542
01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:14.877
MATT: You find no bread.

2543
01:33:14.877 --> 01:33:17.167
LIAM: Also, you described this place

2544
01:33:17.167 --> 01:33:18.681
like the Flatiron Building, right?

2545
01:33:18.681 --> 01:33:19.514
Just like a cake wedge?

2546
01:33:19.514 --> 01:33:20.347
MATT: Similar, yeah.

2547
01:33:20.347 --> 01:33:22.880
It's rounded--
LIAM: So the wide part on the front?

2548
01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.397
MATT: There's like a big cavern alcove,

2549
01:33:25.397 --> 01:33:26.778
and it's built into the back of it,

2550
01:33:26.778 --> 01:33:29.041
and it rounds out and then comes

2551
01:33:29.041 --> 01:33:30.885
like a wedge like the front of a boat.

2552
01:33:30.885 --> 01:33:32.548
LIAM: Oh, so the front of the house is--

2553
01:33:32.548 --> 01:33:34.599
MATT: The front of the house points out towards you, yeah.

2554
01:33:34.599 --> 01:33:36.727
So if I'm the alcove backing, and this is

2555
01:33:36.727 --> 01:33:39.936
the cavern entrance, and the rest of this is the city,

2556
01:33:39.936 --> 01:33:42.415
it builds out and comes to a pointed wedge,

2557
01:33:42.415 --> 01:33:45.045
and there are balconies at the three floors.

2558
01:33:45.045 --> 01:33:47.675
LIAM: While looking for bread, can I see from the top

2559
01:33:47.675 --> 01:33:49.932
if the back of the building is connected

2560
01:33:49.932 --> 01:33:50.991
to the back of the cavern wall?

2561
01:33:50.991 --> 01:33:53.030
MATT: It is.
LIAM: It is, okay.

2562
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:55.023
No bread, though.
MATT: No bread, I'm sorry.

2563
01:33:55.023 --> 01:33:58.378
MICA: With my keen hearing, can I try and hear anything

2564
01:33:58.378 --> 01:34:01.121
on the first floor, like hear into the--

2565
01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:04.691
press bat ear to door to see if I hear footsteps?

2566
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:06.448
MATT: Sure. Make a perception check.

2567
01:34:06.448 --> 01:34:08.448
MICA: Ah ha, with advantage.

2568
01:34:10.642 --> 01:34:12.663
19 plus eight.

2569
01:34:12.663 --> 01:34:13.996
MATT: 19 plus eight.

2570
01:34:15.192 --> 01:34:19.763
Listening in, you do not hear any nearby footsteps, no.

2571
01:34:19.763 --> 01:34:21.146
LIAM: As there is no bread up here,

2572
01:34:21.146 --> 01:34:22.170
I'm going to start to look

2573
01:34:22.170 --> 01:34:23.891
and see if there is some sort of door

2574
01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:26.248
or entrance on the roof as well.

2575
01:34:26.248 --> 01:34:29.330
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

2576
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:31.812
(laughter)

2577
01:34:31.812 --> 01:34:33.445
LIAM: That's a one.
MATT: That's a one, no door.

2578
01:34:33.445 --> 01:34:34.886
LIAM: But I'm going to use Fortune's Favor.

2579
01:34:34.886 --> 01:34:35.719
MATT: Okay.

2580
01:34:37.014 --> 01:34:38.629
LIAM: That is a 20.

2581
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:40.170
MATT: A 20, okay.

2582
01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:45.120
You do see the outline

2583
01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.304
of some sort of a hatch.

2584
01:34:50.625 --> 01:34:53.004
You're not sure if it opens up or opens in.

2585
01:34:53.004 --> 01:34:54.725
But you do see the outline of a hatch.

2586
01:34:54.725 --> 01:34:56.514
LIAM: That's probably where they're keeping the bread.

2587
01:34:56.514 --> 01:34:57.807
LAURA: Is it on the roof?

2588
01:34:57.807 --> 01:34:59.671
Are we on the roof?

2589
01:34:59.671 --> 01:35:01.117
LIAM: I am on the roof. Are you on the roof?

2590
01:35:01.117 --> 01:35:03.302
LAURA: I'm right next to you, so I think so.

2591
01:35:03.302 --> 01:35:05.217
LIAM: I'm very stupid as a bat.

2592
01:35:05.217 --> 01:35:07.319
Hello.
LAURA: Hi.

2593
01:35:07.319 --> 01:35:08.759
LIAM: They're keeping the bread in there.

2594
01:35:08.759 --> 01:35:10.907
MICA: I see them just flapping and not doing anything,

2595
01:35:10.907 --> 01:35:13.303
so I go up and join them, like: Have you found anything?

2596
01:35:13.303 --> 01:35:14.671
LAURA: We found the bread.

2597
01:35:14.671 --> 01:35:15.987
MICA: There is no bread.

2598
01:35:15.987 --> 01:35:18.740
LIAM: No, but there is underneath this trap door, is bread.

2599
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.896
MICA: Oh, there's a trap door, that's good to know.

2600
01:35:20.896 --> 01:35:22.407
Okay.
TRAVIS: [inaudible]

2601
01:35:22.407 --> 01:35:24.657
(laughter)

2602
01:35:27.549 --> 01:35:28.725
MICA: We should go back to the others

2603
01:35:28.725 --> 01:35:30.028
and tell them that we found a door.

2604
01:35:30.028 --> 01:35:32.491
LAURA: If we turn into ourselves right now,

2605
01:35:32.491 --> 01:35:35.075
we could open up the thing and get the bread out now.

2606
01:35:35.075 --> 01:35:37.746
MICA: But we have to take a nap first.

2607
01:35:37.746 --> 01:35:40.883
LIAM: Think about it for a moment.

2608
01:35:40.883 --> 01:35:43.573
We are very tired, but the bread

2609
01:35:43.573 --> 01:35:44.875
is right there, so what is--

2610
01:35:44.875 --> 01:35:47.285
MICA: No, no, no, no, the bread's at my house.

2611
01:35:47.285 --> 01:35:49.532
The bread's at my house.

2612
01:35:49.532 --> 01:35:51.800
LIAM: That changes everything, let's go back to the others.

2613
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:53.092
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2614
01:35:53.092 --> 01:35:53.925
MICA: That's what I thought,

2615
01:35:53.925 --> 01:35:55.651
okay, come with me.

2616
01:35:55.651 --> 01:35:56.982
TRAVIS: Your [inaudible] Slightly.

2617
01:35:56.982 --> 01:35:58.073
(laughter)

2618
01:35:58.073 --> 01:35:59.187
LIAM: What do you mean?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2619
01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:00.435
(laughter)

2620
01:36:00.435 --> 01:36:03.169
TALIESIN: It's [inaudible].

2621
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:04.780
TRAVIS: (high-pitched yelling)
MARISHA: Eh, eh.

2622
01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:06.623
SAM: So Beau, you're saying that if I slide

2623
01:36:06.623 --> 01:36:09.982
my front foot forward while I'm kicking up the back,

2624
01:36:09.982 --> 01:36:13.071
it will make the board just flip up a little bit?

2625
01:36:13.071 --> 01:36:15.926
MARISHA: Yeah, you have to shift your weight backwards

2626
01:36:15.926 --> 01:36:18.178
and have to really go for it.

2627
01:36:18.178 --> 01:36:22.133
MATT: (flapping) Three bats arrive.
TALIESIN: What board?

2628
01:36:22.133 --> 01:36:24.473
LIAM: Hold on, I've been waiting for this.

2629
01:36:24.473 --> 01:36:25.542
MARISHA: (pained) Ah!

2630
01:36:25.542 --> 01:36:26.517
(laughter)

2631
01:36:26.517 --> 01:36:28.403
SAM: Why are you hitting us?

2632
01:36:28.403 --> 01:36:29.933
MARISHA: Why?!

2633
01:36:29.933 --> 01:36:32.575
That's way more than I've ever hit you.

2634
01:36:32.575 --> 01:36:34.065
SAM: This purple bat is hitting me.

2635
01:36:34.065 --> 01:36:35.839
TRAVIS: For the rest of the campaign.

2636
01:36:35.839 --> 01:36:38.740
LAURA: I'm blue.
SAM: Blue, blue.

2637
01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:40.428
Blue.

2638
01:36:40.428 --> 01:36:41.919
MICA: I'm going to un-Wild Shape.

2639
01:36:41.919 --> 01:36:42.752
MATT: Okay.

2640
01:36:44.659 --> 01:36:45.500
SAM: Nope.

2641
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.750
TRAVIS: Oh, there's still one more! (slapping)

2642
01:36:48.663 --> 01:36:50.083
MATT: You do one point of damage.

2643
01:36:50.083 --> 01:36:51.966
How many hit points does a bat have?

2644
01:36:51.966 --> 01:36:53.712
LAURA: One point.

2645
01:36:53.712 --> 01:36:56.771
MATT: Jester emerges from bat form.

2646
01:36:56.771 --> 01:37:00.212
MICA: You bitch-slapped Jester back into existence.

2647
01:37:00.212 --> 01:37:03.279
LAURA: You slapped the blue out of her hair!

2648
01:37:03.279 --> 01:37:06.014
TRAVIS: You slapped the highlights out of her hair!

2649
01:37:06.014 --> 01:37:10.613
(laughter)

2650
01:37:10.613 --> 01:37:13.409
Welcome back, what'd you see?

2651
01:37:13.409 --> 01:37:17.653
LAURA: We found a latch on the roof, it was a latch.

2652
01:37:17.653 --> 01:37:18.690
MICA: It was like a door.

2653
01:37:18.690 --> 01:37:20.060
LIAM: Some sort of a hatch.

2654
01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:21.784
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: A latch-hatch door?

2655
01:37:21.784 --> 01:37:24.269
LAURA: A latch-hatch door on the roof.

2656
01:37:24.269 --> 01:37:26.780
There's no back to the house, because it backs up

2657
01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:30.120
to the rock, but if we could get up onto the roof,

2658
01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.799
it blocks the view.

2659
01:37:31.799 --> 01:37:32.828
SAM: Guards up there?

2660
01:37:32.828 --> 01:37:35.336
MICA: No, and I didn't hear or see anybody

2661
01:37:35.336 --> 01:37:38.253
on the first floor and it's dark, so.

2662
01:37:38.253 --> 01:37:41.253
TRAVIS: The house backs into the cavern, into the rock.

2663
01:37:41.253 --> 01:37:42.086
MICA: Yeah.

2664
01:37:42.086 --> 01:37:43.810
TRAVIS: Oh, they've definitely got a vault.

2665
01:37:43.810 --> 01:37:48.096
MICA: I also made a tentative plan deal with bats.

2666
01:37:48.096 --> 01:37:51.267
They said that if anybody comes in and looks suspicious,

2667
01:37:51.267 --> 01:37:53.925
they're going to start squeaking.

2668
01:37:53.925 --> 01:37:56.405
So if we hear squeaking, we're in trouble.

2669
01:37:56.405 --> 01:37:57.687
MARISHA: Is it a different kind of squeak

2670
01:37:57.687 --> 01:38:01.012
than their normal squeak? How will we differentiate?

2671
01:38:01.012 --> 01:38:03.454
TALIESIN: They have a plethora of squeaks, I would imagine.

2672
01:38:03.454 --> 01:38:05.902
MICA: We didn't get that far in the conversation.

2673
01:38:05.902 --> 01:38:08.745
I had to promise them bread; it was very complicated.

2674
01:38:08.745 --> 01:38:09.856
LAURA: Oh, bread.

2675
01:38:09.856 --> 01:38:11.041
TALIESIN: Do a lot of things for bread.

2676
01:38:11.041 --> 01:38:12.602
MICA: Yeah, everybody would do a lot of things

2677
01:38:12.602 --> 01:38:13.734
for bread, apparently.

2678
01:38:13.734 --> 01:38:15.302
LIAM: I'm so hungry right now--

2679
01:38:15.302 --> 01:38:16.851
SAM: Well, we have a tentative plan.

2680
01:38:16.851 --> 01:38:19.874
We'll walk back to the tavern tonight,

2681
01:38:19.874 --> 01:38:22.452
I mean, wherever we're staying, no, your house tonight.

2682
01:38:22.452 --> 01:38:23.439
TALIESIN: Hot cocoa.

2683
01:38:23.439 --> 01:38:25.157
SAM: Stop at the bakery.

2684
01:38:25.157 --> 01:38:27.781
Are you looking at my bare midriff right now?

2685
01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:28.913
(laughter)

2686
01:38:28.913 --> 01:38:32.875
And how it's sort of hanging over my skirt

2687
01:38:32.875 --> 01:38:34.287
that I decided to wear, even though

2688
01:38:34.287 --> 01:38:36.343
you can't see below my waist?

2689
01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:37.722
MATT: Hey man.
MARISHA: Commitment.

2690
01:38:37.722 --> 01:38:39.699
MATT: Yeah, if you're going to go, go all the way.

2691
01:38:39.699 --> 01:38:41.223
MICA: Oh.
MATT: No, Sam.

2692
01:38:41.223 --> 01:38:42.945
MICA: Oh, oh.

2693
01:38:42.945 --> 01:38:44.120
(laughter)

2694
01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.232
LIAM: Was it Olivier who said he didn't feel like

2695
01:38:46.232 --> 01:38:48.867
he was the character until he put on the shoes?

2696
01:38:48.867 --> 01:38:51.265
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: It's like that, Sam.

2697
01:38:51.265 --> 01:38:54.241
TRAVIS: Olivier rolls in his grave.

2698
01:38:54.241 --> 01:38:55.211
MATT: Is it safe?

2699
01:38:55.211 --> 01:38:56.850
No.

2700
01:38:56.850 --> 01:39:00.689
SAM: So we'll go stop at the bakery, go to Reani's,

2701
01:39:00.689 --> 01:39:03.402
have a slumber party, and then go in through the roof.

2702
01:39:03.402 --> 01:39:05.981
MICA: Eat some bread, then in go through the roof.

2703
01:39:05.981 --> 01:39:07.143
LAURA: Yeah, because it's still pretty early,

2704
01:39:07.143 --> 01:39:09.461
we can get up in the middle of the night and do this.

2705
01:39:09.461 --> 01:39:10.344
MARISHA: Yeah.

2706
01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:13.908
Hey, do you want to go talk with that

2707
01:39:13.908 --> 01:39:17.198
other Cobalt Soul guy about the moon?

2708
01:39:17.198 --> 01:39:18.137
LIAM: The moony?

2709
01:39:18.137 --> 01:39:20.554
MARISHA: The moony guy?

2710
01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:23.506
LIAM: What are we hoping to accomplish with this gentleman?

2711
01:39:23.506 --> 01:39:24.748
MARISHA: I don't know.

2712
01:39:26.018 --> 01:39:27.578
LIAM: Well, you're really selling me on it.

2713
01:39:27.578 --> 01:39:29.099
SAM: He didn't seem like he knew anything.

2714
01:39:29.099 --> 01:39:30.401
MARISHA: He didn't know shit.

2715
01:39:31.267 --> 01:39:34.849
It would just be for formality's sake, I think.

2716
01:39:34.849 --> 01:39:37.568
Or we could just blow him off.

2717
01:39:37.568 --> 01:39:38.651
SAM: Seems fine.

2718
01:39:40.712 --> 01:39:42.698
LIAM: It doesn't seem pressing.

2719
01:39:42.698 --> 01:39:44.032
MARISHA: Mm-mm.

2720
01:39:44.032 --> 01:39:46.825
LIAM: But perhaps it would ingratiate us

2721
01:39:46.825 --> 01:39:51.166
back into the good graces of the library here.

2722
01:39:52.814 --> 01:39:54.207
MARISHA: I don't know.

2723
01:39:54.207 --> 01:39:56.848
We could just leave a note.

2724
01:39:56.848 --> 01:39:58.614
Okay, you want to stop by and be like:

2725
01:39:58.614 --> 01:40:01.512
Oh, man, we're so busy.

2726
01:40:01.512 --> 01:40:03.634
Let's, you know.

2727
01:40:03.634 --> 01:40:05.318
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

2728
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:09.453
LIAM: Yeah, I think we could earn a little more capital

2729
01:40:09.453 --> 01:40:13.095
at the library.
MARISHA: All right.

2730
01:40:13.095 --> 01:40:15.112
LIAM: Get into their better graces.

2731
01:40:15.112 --> 01:40:16.682
Why don't you guys go ahead for your cocoa

2732
01:40:16.682 --> 01:40:18.660
and we'll be right behind you?

2733
01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:19.825
TALIESIN: All right.

2734
01:40:19.825 --> 01:40:20.720
LAURA: Okay.

2735
01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:22.652
MICA: Should we save you a cup?

2736
01:40:22.652 --> 01:40:24.268
LIAM: Yes, please.
LIAM: Okay.

2737
01:40:25.588 --> 01:40:28.058
MATT: All right, so you guys head back to Reani's house.

2738
01:40:28.058 --> 01:40:29.717
LAURA: Stopping by the cupcakes.

2739
01:40:29.717 --> 01:40:32.679
MATT: Okay, you pick up some cupcakes without issue.

2740
01:40:32.679 --> 01:40:35.890
Another dozen or so, a variety pack?

2741
01:40:35.890 --> 01:40:37.954
LAURA: Let's get two dozen just to be safe this time.

2742
01:40:37.954 --> 01:40:40.704
MATT: All righty, two dozen cupcakes.

2743
01:40:42.807 --> 01:40:47.255
We'll say that'll put you at 12 silver.

2744
01:40:47.255 --> 01:40:48.588
LAURA: You got it.

2745
01:40:48.588 --> 01:40:50.497
MICA and LAURA: Worth it.

2746
01:40:50.497 --> 01:40:52.777
(snickers)

2747
01:40:52.777 --> 01:40:55.572
TRAVIS: (gravelly) Cupcakes.

2748
01:40:55.572 --> 01:40:58.527
MATT: Now you guys are going to meet up with Demid,

2749
01:40:58.527 --> 01:41:01.952
or cancel, or what's the scenario?

2750
01:41:01.952 --> 01:41:03.203
LIAM: Just go to the place where--

2751
01:41:03.203 --> 01:41:04.787
MARISHA: We're going to go meet up with him.

2752
01:41:04.787 --> 01:41:07.863
LIAM: That he would be.
MARISHA: Yeah, at the tavern.

2753
01:41:07.863 --> 01:41:09.304
MATT: Okay.

2754
01:41:12.216 --> 01:41:15.580
Okay, which tavern are you heading towards?

2755
01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:16.705
MARISHA: It was the one that we were at

2756
01:41:16.705 --> 01:41:17.836
earlier, right?
MATT: The Broken Stool.

2757
01:41:17.836 --> 01:41:20.777
MARISHA: The Broken Stool, isn't that what he said?

2758
01:41:20.777 --> 01:41:22.385
MATT: Maybe.
LIAM: Caleb would know.

2759
01:41:22.385 --> 01:41:23.957
I don't, but Caleb knows.

2760
01:41:23.957 --> 01:41:26.733
MARISHA: No, Tumbled Tankards.
LIAM: Because Caleb remembers everything.

2761
01:41:26.733 --> 01:41:28.043
MATT: So Tumbled Tankards would be the bar

2762
01:41:28.043 --> 01:41:29.390
that you guys went to previously today.

2763
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:30.848
TRAVIS: Where we just went.
MATT: Right.

2764
01:41:30.848 --> 01:41:33.293
MARISHA: That's what I thought.
TRAVIS: It is the--

2765
01:41:33.293 --> 01:41:34.201
MARISHA: The cop bar.

2766
01:41:34.201 --> 01:41:36.067
MATT: Okay, all right.

2767
01:41:36.067 --> 01:41:40.083
You go ahead and you wait a good, like,

2768
01:41:40.083 --> 01:41:42.691
hour or so.

2769
01:41:44.742 --> 01:41:46.659
And he doesn't show up.

2770
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:50.763
MARISHA: Well, I hate fucking waiting on people.

2771
01:41:50.763 --> 01:41:54.227
LIAM: Let's give it 30 more minutes.

2772
01:41:54.227 --> 01:41:56.533
MARISHA: I'm going to get more booze, then.

2773
01:41:56.533 --> 01:41:58.107
LIAM: I slap down a gold. It's on me.

2774
01:41:58.107 --> 01:42:00.415
Go get us another round.

2775
01:42:01.667 --> 01:42:02.667
MATT: All righty.

2776
01:42:03.849 --> 01:42:05.853
MARISHA: Can always just leave a note.

2777
01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:08.441
Let him know we were here so we don't seem--

2778
01:42:08.441 --> 01:42:12.366
LIAM: You know, in the meantime,

2779
01:42:12.366 --> 01:42:13.616
the last 24 hours

2780
01:42:13.616 --> 01:42:17.429
went a lot better than some would expect or anticipate.

2781
01:42:17.429 --> 01:42:19.797
You know, just when I think we are

2782
01:42:19.797 --> 01:42:21.665
a group of irredeemable fuck-ups,

2783
01:42:21.665 --> 01:42:25.614
we manage to pull one out of the fire.

2784
01:42:25.614 --> 01:42:27.031
We certainly did.

2785
01:42:28.605 --> 01:42:30.337
I don't know, I'm up and I'm down, you know.

2786
01:42:30.337 --> 01:42:32.784
Sometimes I think we can take over the world.

2787
01:42:32.784 --> 01:42:35.000
I don't want to take over the world, you know what I mean,

2788
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.350
but then I swing back and think that

2789
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:38.958
what we're doing is stupid.

2790
01:42:38.958 --> 01:42:43.533
But after a day like yesterday,

2791
01:42:43.533 --> 01:42:45.133
I feel good.

2792
01:42:45.133 --> 01:42:47.037
MARISHA: That's pretty awesome.

2793
01:42:47.037 --> 01:42:48.631
We duped a white dragon.

2794
01:42:48.631 --> 01:42:50.488
(chuckles)

2795
01:42:50.488 --> 01:42:53.094
MATT: "Oh, you did show up! Well, ha."

2796
01:42:53.094 --> 01:42:54.261
MARISHA: Fuck.

2797
01:42:55.161 --> 01:42:56.586
MATT: Comes in.
SAM: You came there!

2798
01:42:56.586 --> 01:42:59.291
He's got his coat on, and he sits there,

2799
01:42:59.291 --> 01:43:03.591
"Oh, and so you have come as well, friend."

2800
01:43:03.591 --> 01:43:05.975
LIAM: I am her assistant, her moon assistant.

2801
01:43:05.975 --> 01:43:06.949
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2802
01:43:06.949 --> 01:43:09.326
LIAM: She's like the big moon and I am the small moon

2803
01:43:09.326 --> 01:43:10.630
behind the the big moon.

2804
01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:11.584
MARISHA: Just a little moon.

2805
01:43:11.584 --> 01:43:13.245
MATT: "Are you a studier of Ruidus as well?"

2806
01:43:13.245 --> 01:43:16.640
LIAM: I'm an amateur, but I try.

2807
01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.595
MATT: "Ah, this is fortuitous, definitely.

2808
01:43:19.595 --> 01:43:21.662
"Ha! Mm! (sniffs)

2809
01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:24.053
"I'll go get some milk,"

2810
01:43:24.053 --> 01:43:26.148
and he gets up and leaves to the bar.

2811
01:43:26.148 --> 01:43:27.680
LIAM: Caleb downs his drink.

2812
01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:28.981
MARISHA: I do the same.

2813
01:43:28.981 --> 01:43:30.085
TRAVIS: Get that fucking guy drunk.

2814
01:43:30.085 --> 01:43:33.298
MATT: So you spend the better part of the next

2815
01:43:33.298 --> 01:43:36.294
30 or so minutes conversing about what?

2816
01:43:36.294 --> 01:43:38.243
What do you want to-- as opposed to role playing

2817
01:43:38.243 --> 01:43:40.709
an extensive conversation of awkwardness,

2818
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:43.291
are you looking for any information?

2819
01:43:43.291 --> 01:43:45.503
LIAM: I want to--

2820
01:43:45.503 --> 01:43:48.645
No, I want to ingratiate ourselves to him

2821
01:43:48.645 --> 01:43:50.436
and make him like us.

2822
01:43:50.436 --> 01:43:51.269
MATT: Okay.

2823
01:43:51.269 --> 01:43:53.253
MARISHA: Can I compare any type of the moon cycles

2824
01:43:53.253 --> 01:43:58.023
based on any of the demon activity that we've encountered?

2825
01:43:58.023 --> 01:43:58.856
MATT: Sure.

2826
01:43:58.856 --> 01:44:01.122
MARISHA: Looking at his extensive notes and mine,

2827
01:44:01.122 --> 01:44:05.538
is there any type of like cycle that it seems to sync up on?

2828
01:44:05.538 --> 01:44:08.455
MATT: "Interesting, interesting, indeed."

2829
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:13.167
MARISHA: I need to know when my moon is coming!

2830
01:44:13.167 --> 01:44:14.625
MATT: Best you can tell--
LAURA: Demons are all [inaudible] period.

2831
01:44:14.625 --> 01:44:16.842
MARISHA: It's true!

2832
01:44:16.842 --> 01:44:18.935
MATT: There's two cycles.

2833
01:44:18.935 --> 01:44:22.804
We have, I mean, Catha is the common moon cycle,

2834
01:44:22.804 --> 01:44:26.424
that's the great, you know, white moon in the moon-lit sky.

2835
01:44:26.424 --> 01:44:27.471
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

2836
01:44:27.471 --> 01:44:30.555
MATT: That cycle is, you know, anywhere between

2837
01:44:30.555 --> 01:44:35.555
30- to 40-day cycle, waxes and wanes per normal.

2838
01:44:35.745 --> 01:44:39.045
Ruidus is a very slow orbit.

2839
01:44:40.318 --> 01:44:42.019
It's visible for about half the year.

2840
01:44:42.019 --> 01:44:44.715
It takes a full year essentially for a revolution.

2841
01:44:44.715 --> 01:44:47.996
It's far more distant, and Ruidus is

2842
01:44:47.996 --> 01:44:50.061
very prominent in the sky at the moment.

2843
01:44:50.061 --> 01:44:53.832
Very prominent meaning you can see it,

2844
01:44:53.832 --> 01:44:56.107
you know, this faint little

2845
01:44:56.107 --> 01:45:00.569
brown-maroon type dot

2846
01:45:00.569 --> 01:45:04.369
in the sky during the evening, it's barely noticeable.

2847
01:45:04.369 --> 01:45:07.214
The day it's even fainter.

2848
01:45:07.214 --> 01:45:09.382
But it's there.

2849
01:45:09.382 --> 01:45:13.409
So other than that, there's no real correlation.

2850
01:45:13.409 --> 01:45:15.181
MARISHA: Okay.

2851
01:45:15.181 --> 01:45:16.772
LIAM: I agree, I just want to fast track it back

2852
01:45:16.772 --> 01:45:18.622
to our friends. But using this 30 minutes,

2853
01:45:18.622 --> 01:45:20.239
Caleb would just try to

2854
01:45:20.239 --> 01:45:22.596
chat him up in a very intellectual way

2855
01:45:22.596 --> 01:45:25.309
and jovial way so that he likes us a lot

2856
01:45:25.309 --> 01:45:27.597
and continues to put a good word in for us

2857
01:45:27.597 --> 01:45:29.291
at the Vellum Steeple, is my hope.

2858
01:45:29.291 --> 01:45:32.720
MATT: Make a standard charisma check for me, please.

2859
01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:33.906
MARISHA: Just him?

2860
01:45:33.906 --> 01:45:34.739
MATT: Hmm?

2861
01:45:34.739 --> 01:45:35.908
MARISHA: Does he get advantage because I--

2862
01:45:35.908 --> 01:45:36.934
MATT: You're helping? Sure, okay.

2863
01:45:36.934 --> 01:45:38.872
MARISHA: I'm helping!
MATT: All right, so that's part of--

2864
01:45:38.872 --> 01:45:40.182
LIAM: At advantage?

2865
01:45:40.182 --> 01:45:43.205
MATT: Yeah, because she's helping you with the check.

2866
01:45:43.205 --> 01:45:44.353
MARISHA: My charisma sucks.

2867
01:45:44.353 --> 01:45:45.528
LIAM: The second one was a one,

2868
01:45:45.528 --> 01:45:47.183
so I'll take the original 18.

2869
01:45:47.183 --> 01:45:49.553
MATT: All right, all right.

2870
01:45:49.553 --> 01:45:53.043
He gets pretty deep in his milk cups,

2871
01:45:53.043 --> 01:45:56.209
and seems to be enjoying your presence,

2872
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:59.326
and when you find the right moment

2873
01:45:59.326 --> 01:46:01.085
in the conversation where it begins to lull

2874
01:46:01.085 --> 01:46:04.077
that you both abruptly oh, I'm so sorry, we have to go.

2875
01:46:04.077 --> 01:46:04.951
MARISHA: So busy.
MATT: Yeah.

2876
01:46:04.951 --> 01:46:06.363
"Oh, that's all right, no worries.

2877
01:46:06.363 --> 01:46:09.339
"Thank you so much for taking the time.

2878
01:46:09.339 --> 01:46:11.085
"You know where to find me."

2879
01:46:11.085 --> 01:46:12.816
LIAM: We will see you at the Steeple.

2880
01:46:12.816 --> 01:46:15.543
MATT: "Of course, please, until tomorrow?"

2881
01:46:15.543 --> 01:46:16.508
MARISHA: We'll see you.

2882
01:46:16.508 --> 01:46:18.925
MATT: "All right, all right."
MARISHA: Yes.

2883
01:46:21.263 --> 01:46:23.180
Be careful now, yeah.

2884
01:46:24.188 --> 01:46:26.521
MATT: "Intolerant,' and he leaves.

2885
01:46:27.428 --> 01:46:29.308
LIAM: I know more than I ever wanted to about

2886
01:46:29.308 --> 01:46:30.593
the cycles of the moon.

2887
01:46:30.593 --> 01:46:32.262
MARISHA: Let's go.

2888
01:46:32.262 --> 01:46:33.227
LIAM: Return to the others.

2889
01:46:33.227 --> 01:46:35.552
MATT: (chuckles) All right.

2890
01:46:36.627 --> 01:46:40.437
You all regather, you find the rest of your party

2891
01:46:40.437 --> 01:46:44.412
nearly sick on cupcakes. (laughs)

2892
01:46:44.412 --> 01:46:47.215
Pillow forts partially constructed in the middle

2893
01:46:47.215 --> 01:46:52.115
of the comfortable, if now not as spacious interior

2894
01:46:52.115 --> 01:46:55.631
of Reani's home, but a sleepover it is

2895
01:46:55.631 --> 01:46:58.654
as you all find your respective corners of the floor,

2896
01:46:58.654 --> 01:47:01.551
makeshift bedding assembled, you all eventually

2897
01:47:01.551 --> 01:47:06.216
find yourselves comfortably falling into a night's sleep.

2898
01:47:06.216 --> 01:47:07.791
And that's where we'll take a break.

2899
01:47:07.791 --> 01:47:10.081
Be back here in a few minutes.

2900
01:47:10.081 --> 01:47:11.875
Check out what happens the next morning.

2901
01:47:11.875 --> 01:47:13.780
We do have our giveaway.

2902
01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:15.484
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

2903
01:47:15.484 --> 01:47:20.484
MATT: We have, as tonight's prize, a Bolivian rosewood

2904
01:47:20.491 --> 01:47:22.111
dice vault from our friends at Wyrmwood.

2905
01:47:22.111 --> 01:47:24.555
TRAVIS: Oh!
MATT: Available to one lucky winner.

2906
01:47:24.555 --> 01:47:27.106
Smells like niceness.

2907
01:47:27.106 --> 01:47:32.106
Tonight's keyword is owl, O-W-L, owl.

2908
01:47:32.517 --> 01:47:34.392
Enter it once and once only, more than that

2909
01:47:34.392 --> 01:47:35.711
and you'll be disqualified, and once again,

2910

2911
01:47:37.670 --> 01:47:38.731
because stupid laws.

2912
01:47:38.731 --> 01:47:40.899
Anyway, we'll be back here shortly with a winner.

2913
01:47:40.899 --> 01:47:42.468
See you in a minute.

2914
01:47:43.642 --> 01:47:44.845

(eerie music)
(pounding sounds)

2934
01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.414
BINWIN: Hi, I'm Binwin Bronzebottom, celebrity dwarf

2935
01:48:43.414 --> 01:48:46.193
and video game enthusiast, and this is my sidekick, Crowy.

2936
01:48:46.193 --> 01:48:47.026
CROWY: Hello.

2937
01:48:47.026 --> 01:48:48.654
BINWIN: We're here to tell you about Idle Champions

2938
01:48:48.654 --> 01:48:51.176
of the Forgotten Realms, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based

2939
01:48:51.176 --> 01:48:53.886
strategy management game from Code Name Entertainment.

2940
01:48:53.886 --> 01:48:56.028
They're Canadian, so you know it's good.

2941
01:48:56.028 --> 01:48:57.182
CROWY: Let's talk about the game.

2942
01:48:57.182 --> 01:48:58.394
Did you ever play Cookie Clicker?

2943
01:48:58.394 --> 01:48:59.291
BINWIN: Of course not.

2944
01:48:59.291 --> 01:49:00.963
CROWY: This game is a management game like that,

2945
01:49:00.963 --> 01:49:02.725
but with far more emphasis on strategy,

2946
01:49:02.725 --> 01:49:05.230
and with a flavory of D&amp;D's lore and legendary heroes,

2947
01:49:05.230 --> 01:49:06.943
you can unlock your favorite champions,

2948
01:49:06.943 --> 01:49:09.683
like Farideh from Erin M. Evans' Brimstone Angels saga,

2949
01:49:09.683 --> 01:49:11.824
Minsc and Boo from Baldur's Gate, and the fourth

2950
01:49:11.824 --> 01:49:14.222
and final member of Acquisitions Incorporated The C Team,

2951
01:49:14.222 --> 01:49:16.796
Amy Falcone's Walnut Dankgrass.

2952
01:49:16.796 --> 01:49:17.985
BINWIN: The K is silent.

2953
01:49:17.985 --> 01:49:19.788
CROWY: Create the best adventuring party possible

2954
01:49:19.788 --> 01:49:22.218
based on formation options, your character's ability,

2955
01:49:22.218 --> 01:49:24.079
and the obstacles and enemies you face.

2956
01:49:24.079 --> 01:49:26.132
BINWIN: you just randomly click on things like I do

2957
01:49:26.132 --> 01:49:27.103
and hope for the best.

2958
01:49:27.103 --> 01:49:28.713
CROWY: You can click on enemies to assist your champions,

2959
01:49:28.713 --> 01:49:30.304
or you can set 'em up and walk away

2960
01:49:30.304 --> 01:49:32.370
and let them do their thing. It's entirely up to you.

2961
01:49:32.370 --> 01:49:33.936
BINWIN: I'm playing on the toilet right now.

2962
01:49:33.936 --> 01:49:35.155
CROWY: Why wouldn't you be?

2963
01:49:35.155 --> 01:49:37.077
Idle Champions is available on all your favorite

2964
01:49:37.077 --> 01:49:39.138
gaming platforms, including tablets,

2965
01:49:39.138 --> 01:49:41.334
for the low, low price of free.

2966
01:49:41.334 --> 01:49:42.258
So download it now.

2967
01:49:42.258 --> 01:49:43.435
BINWIN: End it with joke.

2968
01:49:43.435 --> 01:49:44.268
CROWY: You're not supposed to read--

2969
01:49:44.268 --> 01:49:45.101
BINWIN: It says end with joke.

2970
01:49:45.101 --> 01:49:46.367
CROWY: No, we're supposed to come up with a joke

2971
01:49:46.367 --> 01:49:48.203
to go with where it says "end with joke."

2972
01:49:48.203 --> 01:49:49.412
BINWIN: Oh, I don't know, "end with joke"

2973
01:49:49.412 --> 01:49:50.245
is pretty funny.

2974
01:49:50.245 --> 01:49:51.380
CROWY: Wait, on three, ready?

2975
01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:52.962
BINWIN: Yeah.
CROWY: One, two, three.

2976
01:49:52.962 --> 01:49:54.172
BINWIN and CROWY: End with joke.

2977
01:49:54.172 --> 01:49:55.624
(laughter)

2978
01:49:55.624 --> 01:49:58.396
BINWIN: I think it's funny. It's very funny.

2979
01:49:59.438 --> 01:50:04.412
(Strings playing "Wedding March")

2980
01:50:04.412 --> 01:50:06.604
(Strings playing "Wedding March")

2981
01:50:07.562 --> 01:50:12.356
(Steel drum playing "Wedding March")

2982
01:50:12.356 --> 01:50:17.354
(Steel drum playing "Wedding March")

2983
01:50:17.354 --> 01:50:21.977
(Steel drum playing "Wedding March")

2984
01:50:21.977 --> 01:50:26.426
(Steel drum playing "Wedding March")

2985
01:50:26.426 --> 01:50:31.376
(Calypso-style music)

2986
01:50:36.602 --> 01:50:39.103
BRIAN (V.O): Last time, on Talks Machina.

2987
01:50:39.103 --> 01:50:40.940
MICA: Hey, are we on the internet?

2988
01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.661
DANI: Why Mica, yes we are.

2989
01:50:42.661 --> 01:50:44.794
MICA: Oh, well, guess what, everybody?

2990
01:50:44.794 --> 01:50:47.603
Tonight it's Talks Micina.

2991
01:50:49.371 --> 01:50:52.159
MATT: You know, the beard was nice and fun for a while,

2992
01:50:52.159 --> 01:50:55.413
and it may come back, but I just needed some change.

2993
01:50:55.413 --> 01:50:56.379
BRIAN: I understand.
MICA: Is it breezy?

2994
01:50:56.379 --> 01:50:57.333
MATT: And, hmm?

2995
01:50:57.333 --> 01:50:58.400
MICA: Is it breezier?

2996
01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.276
MATT: It's breezier, it's more aerodynamic,

2997
01:51:00.276 --> 01:51:02.721
I can move quicker, which is nice.

2998
01:51:02.721 --> 01:51:06.242
I also enjoy having my wife not flinch when I kiss her.

2999
01:51:06.242 --> 01:51:08.406
That's also great.
BRIAN: Yeah.

3000
01:51:08.406 --> 01:51:12.398
MATT: So yeah, it has its positives.

3001
01:51:12.398 --> 01:51:14.904
But I do miss the sculpting of it

3002
01:51:14.904 --> 01:51:18.496
and the caretaking of it, but...

3003
01:51:18.496 --> 01:51:20.425
BRIAN: It's like having another friend.

3004
01:51:20.425 --> 01:51:22.248
MATT: Kind of, and I need those these days, so.

3005
01:51:22.248 --> 01:51:24.073
MICA: Did you name it?

3006
01:51:24.073 --> 01:51:25.810
MATT: It was named The Mercer Beard

3007
01:51:25.810 --> 01:51:27.192
before I had an opportunity to,

3008
01:51:27.192 --> 01:51:29.304
so the internet, thank you for that.

3009
01:51:29.304 --> 01:51:30.370
And I killed it.

3010
01:51:30.370 --> 01:51:31.778
(laughter)

3011
01:51:31.778 --> 01:51:33.453
MATT: It's now at the bottom of the ocean.

3012
01:51:33.453 --> 01:51:35.689
BRIAN: Well, maybe you should've named it Molly

3013
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:37.951
MICA: Wow.

3014
01:51:37.951 --> 01:51:39.462
BRIAN: Wow?

3015
01:51:39.462 --> 01:51:40.787
MATT: Don't listen to him.
MICA: Even I know that's

3016
01:51:40.787 --> 01:51:43.153
out of character-- that's just off-color.

3017
01:51:44.395 --> 01:51:46.592
For shame, good sir.

3018
01:51:46.592 --> 01:51:50.058
MICA: It was just, if you lay out that plan that we had,

3019
01:51:50.058 --> 01:51:52.514
if you speak it out loud, it's dumb.

3020
01:51:52.514 --> 01:51:54.015
It's so dumb.

3021
01:51:54.015 --> 01:51:56.565
MATT: So's every D&amp;D party's plans ever!

3022
01:51:56.565 --> 01:51:57.618
MICA: It's so true.

3023
01:51:57.618 --> 01:52:01.009
MATT: The game is about making stupid plans, fucking it up,

3024
01:52:01.009 --> 01:52:02.961
and hopefully, if the dice work with you,

3025
01:52:02.961 --> 01:52:05.341
somehow making it out alive and going, wow!

3026
01:52:05.341 --> 01:52:06.327
MICA: Wow, we lived!

3027
01:52:06.327 --> 01:52:07.940
MATT: How did we survive!

3028
01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:09.794
BRIAN: I want you to look at that camera

3029
01:52:09.794 --> 01:52:13.721
and I want you to say, "It's time for Cosplay of the Week."

3030
01:52:13.721 --> 01:52:14.743
MICA: All right, ready?

3031
01:52:14.743 --> 01:52:16.635
BRIAN: Wait, wait, yeah, okay go.

3032
01:52:16.635 --> 01:52:19.217
MICA: It's time for Cosplay of the Week.

3033
01:52:19.217 --> 01:52:20.602
BRIAN: Fuck.

3034
01:52:20.602 --> 01:52:21.743
(laughter)

3035
01:52:21.743 --> 01:52:22.576
DANI: Nice.

3036
01:52:22.576 --> 01:52:25.263
Cosplay of the Week!

3037
01:52:25.263 --> 01:52:27.413
Hell yeah.

3038
01:52:27.413 --> 01:52:29.330
MICA: Your job's in danger!

3039
01:52:30.214 --> 01:52:31.880
BRIAN: Hang on, I'm texting my old contacts

3040
01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.246
at Two Broke Girls.

3041
01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:34.590
(laughter)

3042
01:52:34.590 --> 01:52:35.431
BRIAN: See if they're--

3043
01:52:35.431 --> 01:52:36.264
DANI: God, it's been a minute

3044
01:52:36.264 --> 01:52:37.888
since a Two Broke Girls joke.

3045
01:52:37.888 --> 01:52:40.102
BRIAN: CritRoleStats'll let us know how long.

3046
01:52:40.102 --> 01:52:42.487
No, don't, guys, don't go back

3047
01:52:42.487 --> 01:52:44.791
and try to watch all the episodes to find out.

3048
01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:46.584
Our winner for Cosplay of the Week

3049
01:52:46.584 --> 01:52:50.847
was sent in by Jesse of JessoLaurus Rex.

3051
01:52:53.905 --> 01:52:55.581
Let's take a look.

3052
01:52:56.869 --> 01:52:59.211
MICA and MATT: Whoa!

3053
01:53:00.797 --> 01:53:02.115
BRIAN: That's insane.

3054
01:53:02.115 --> 01:53:03.101
DANI: So good.

3055
01:53:03.101 --> 01:53:04.908
MICA: That's so good!

3056
01:53:04.908 --> 01:53:06.671
MATT: That Grog is so intense.

3057
01:53:06.671 --> 01:53:08.736
MICA: Oh, that leather work though!

3058
01:53:08.736 --> 01:53:10.649
BRIAN: Help me out a little bit here with this one,

3059
01:53:10.649 --> 01:53:13.650
because I know ArseQueef's going to gif hers and then mine,

3060
01:53:13.650 --> 01:53:17.650
so I've got to really, (coughs).

3061
01:53:19.177 --> 01:53:22.478
Go in a little tighter, Steve, if you can.

3062
01:53:22.478 --> 01:53:24.062
STEVE: Can't.
BRIAN: Okay.

3063
01:53:24.062 --> 01:53:28.204
(laughter)

3064
01:53:32.276 --> 01:53:33.109
STEVE: Action.

3065
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:34.227
BRIAN: Ah, fuck.

3066
01:53:34.227 --> 01:53:35.727
I already started.

3067
01:53:36.683 --> 01:53:37.516
All right, hold on.

3068
01:53:37.516 --> 01:53:38.349
STEVE: Take it again, Brian.

3069
01:53:38.349 --> 01:53:39.500
BRIAN: Okay, okay.
STEVE: All right.

3070
01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:40.706
BRIAN: (clears throat)

3071
01:53:41.556 --> 01:53:42.507
STEVE: Ready?

3072
01:53:42.507 --> 01:53:43.890
BRIAN: Fuck.
STEVE: Ready?

3073
01:53:44.779 --> 01:53:45.612
All right.

3074
01:53:46.885 --> 01:53:47.968
Take it away.

3075
01:53:52.187 --> 01:53:54.437
BRIAN: It's Fan Art of the Week.

3076
01:53:55.494 --> 01:53:58.379
DANI: Actually, Mica, I have something for you real fast.

3077
01:53:58.379 --> 01:53:59.712
MICA: Oh shit.

3078
01:53:59.712 --> 01:54:00.980
DANI: If you could just sign this.

3079
01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:01.887
BRIAN: Oh Jesus Christ.

3080
01:54:01.887 --> 01:54:05.063
MICA: Oh wow, does this say "Talks Machina Contract" on it?

3081
01:54:05.063 --> 01:54:05.896
DANI: Yeah.

3082
01:54:05.896 --> 01:54:08.070
MICA: Oh, that's crazy, it absolutely does.

3083
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:09.086
I'm just going to--

3084
01:54:09.086 --> 01:54:10.290
live, right?

3085
01:54:10.290 --> 01:54:11.783
MATT: It's happening!

3086
01:54:11.783 --> 01:54:13.814
BRIAN: I would like to thank Matt and Mica

3087
01:54:13.814 --> 01:54:14.992
for joining us.

3088
01:54:14.992 --> 01:54:16.325
MICA: Dani, here you go.

3089
01:54:16.325 --> 01:54:17.819
DANI: This is legally binding.
MICA: Yeah.

3090
01:54:17.819 --> 01:54:20.368
BRIAN: 76 is this Thursday.

3091
01:54:20.368 --> 01:54:21.949
MICA: Thank you, thank you so much.

3092
01:54:21.949 --> 01:54:25.766
Actually, I think this is my job, yeah.

3093
01:54:25.766 --> 01:54:28.833
So we're going to, yeah.

3094
01:54:28.833 --> 01:54:29.884
BRIAN: All right.
MICA: Thank you.

3095
01:54:29.884 --> 01:54:32.365
BRIAN: Yeah, no, that's perfectly all right.

3096
01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:33.340
I'll just--

3097
01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:34.868
MAN OFF CAMERA: Pretty good graphic department.

3098
01:54:34.868 --> 01:54:38.328
MICA: Episode 76 is this Thursday at 7PM PST.

3099
01:54:38.328 --> 01:54:40.448
As always, don't forget to love each other,

3100
01:54:40.448 --> 01:54:43.049
and don't worry, it's almost Thursday.

3101
01:54:43.049 --> 01:54:45.622
Stay turnt, my friends, and remember,

3102
01:54:45.622 --> 01:54:48.452
creepy ain't a crime and neither is D&amp;D.

3103
01:54:48.452 --> 01:54:53.452
(laughter)

3104
01:54:53.481 --> 01:54:56.824
TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-haw Game Ranch.

3105
01:54:56.824 --> 01:54:58.931
BRIAN: I guess now we're just going to be here

3106
01:54:58.931 --> 01:55:02.152
in a fucking jungle ranch for the foreseeable future.

3107
01:55:02.152 --> 01:55:05.888
I just wish we knew a little bit more about this place

3108
01:55:05.888 --> 01:55:06.980
or what it's about.

3109
01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:07.813
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3110
01:55:07.813 --> 01:55:10.018
DANI: (gasps) Oh my god, lads!

3111
01:55:10.018 --> 01:55:12.353
It's him! We found him!

3112
01:55:12.353 --> 01:55:13.914
TRAVIS: A fucking boat?

3113
01:55:13.914 --> 01:55:17.044
DANI: Chosen one, we've found you!

3114
01:55:17.044 --> 01:55:19.668
I can't believe it's you.

3115
01:55:19.668 --> 01:55:22.785
God damn, Ruby was right, you're a little

3116
01:55:22.785 --> 01:55:25.663
fucking snack pack, aren't ya?

3117
01:55:25.663 --> 01:55:28.646
BRIAN: Howdy, new critter, who might you be?

3118
01:55:28.646 --> 01:55:31.237
DANI: My name's Kermlin the Frog,

3119
01:55:31.237 --> 01:55:33.962
and I'm the lead explorer here

3120
01:55:33.962 --> 01:55:35.598
on the jungle ranch.

3121
01:55:36.878 --> 01:55:41.878
TRAVIS: It's nice to meet you, Kermlin the Frog.

3122
01:55:42.177 --> 01:55:45.512
DANI: I was just doing my infamous jungle ranch cruise

3123
01:55:45.512 --> 01:55:47.102
while searching for ya.

3124
01:55:47.102 --> 01:55:51.267
If you got the time, I got the best tour.

3125
01:55:51.267 --> 01:55:53.567
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3126
01:55:53.567 --> 01:55:55.154
BRIAN: I don't know, Travis. We're supposed to be

3127
01:55:55.154 --> 01:55:58.463
playing games and charging up the Game Soul here.

3128
01:55:58.463 --> 01:55:59.753
TRAVIS: Who's actually driving the boat?

3129
01:55:59.753 --> 01:56:01.110
BRIAN: I don't know who's driving the boat, man.

3130
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:02.379
I don't know if we have time to go--

3131
01:56:02.379 --> 01:56:04.537
DANI: I could give a monkey's ass if

3132
01:56:04.537 --> 01:56:06.397
you wanted to go or not,

3133
01:56:06.397 --> 01:56:08.988
you cheeseless quesadilla-looking orphan.

3134
01:56:08.988 --> 01:56:10.502
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3135
01:56:10.502 --> 01:56:13.430
DANI: On your left, you can see the robust,

3136
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:17.807
green foliage of the vast jungle ranch.

3137
01:56:17.807 --> 01:56:21.104
Isn't it ribbeting? (giggling)

3138
01:56:21.104 --> 01:56:22.807
TRAVIS: Did she say "ribbeting?"

3139
01:56:22.807 --> 01:56:23.915
BRIAN: Yes.

3140
01:56:23.915 --> 01:56:26.533
DANI: And now, on your right, you can see

3141
01:56:26.533 --> 01:56:30.027
the beautiful flowers that blossom here.

3142
01:56:30.027 --> 01:56:34.094
Isn't the frogrance just delightful?

3143
01:56:35.527 --> 01:56:36.527
TRAVIS: Frogrance?

3144
01:56:36.527 --> 01:56:38.869
BRIAN: Fuck, man, god dammit.

3145
01:56:38.869 --> 01:56:42.761
DANI: Oh, and I almost frogot.
TRAVIS: (groans)

3146
01:56:42.761 --> 01:56:44.636
DANI: Off in the distance over there,

3147
01:56:44.636 --> 01:56:49.636
you can see the shattered temple of Zolgrux the Mad!

3148
01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:55.580
BRIAN: Wait, what the fuck, Zolgrux the Mad?

3149
01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.629
TRAVIS: (shouts) Go get me!

3150
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:59.052
Go get my body!

3151
01:56:59.052 --> 01:57:01.102
BRIAN: I tried to double peddle, I double jumped.

3152
01:57:01.102 --> 01:57:02.019
Nope, nope.

3153
01:57:03.132 --> 01:57:05.429
TRAVIS: Oh, I fucking' missed him. (shouts)

3154
01:57:05.429 --> 01:57:07.078
BRIAN: Oh.
TRAVIS: What?!

3155
01:57:07.078 --> 01:57:09.911
It's supposed to have missed that!

3156
01:57:11.131 --> 01:57:14.895
Game full of multiple levels when all you need is one.

3157
01:57:14.895 --> 01:57:17.128
Want to murder your entire neighborhood.

3158
01:57:17.128 --> 01:57:18.059
BRIAN: Yeah.

3159
01:57:18.059 --> 01:57:19.692
Yeah, exactly.

3160
01:57:19.692 --> 01:57:21.817
It's kind of like--

3161
01:57:21.817 --> 01:57:24.429
TRAVIS: One and done.
BRIAN: Oh shit, oh god.

3162
01:57:24.429 --> 01:57:26.017
TRAVIS: I bet if we research it, no one's ever beat

3163
01:57:26.017 --> 01:57:27.389
a single level of this game, I'm pretty sure.

3164
01:57:27.389 --> 01:57:29.670
BRIAN: I'm pretty sure. Max, can you look into that?

3165
01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:31.943
How do I double jump, oh!

3166
01:57:31.943 --> 01:57:33.300
I got a pinky.

3167
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:34.987
TRAVIS: They made the first level passable.

3168
01:57:34.987 --> 01:57:36.983
BRIAN: I got a pinky.

3169
01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:39.071
TRAVIS: If we just stay here, we'll be alive.

3170
01:57:39.071 --> 01:57:40.091
BRIAN: I don't think we're going to kill him, man.

3171
01:57:40.091 --> 01:57:42.269
No, fuck, gimme, oh fuck, oh!

3172
01:57:42.269 --> 01:57:46.194
(screaming)

3173
01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:49.182
(groaning)

3174
01:57:49.182 --> 01:57:50.015
BRIAN: Got this.

3175
01:57:50.015 --> 01:57:51.895
TRAVIS: You'll take over the title if you can get it.

3176
01:57:51.895 --> 01:57:52.782
BRIAN: I got this, man.

3177
01:57:52.782 --> 01:57:53.623
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're there, you're--

3178
01:57:53.623 --> 01:57:54.858
BRIAN: What is that?!

3179
01:57:54.858 --> 01:57:57.405
What is that thing shooting at me?

3180
01:57:57.405 --> 01:57:58.655
Fuck you, dude.

3181
01:58:02.593 --> 01:58:03.426
Oh god.

3182
01:58:08.331 --> 01:58:11.344
TRAVIS: I think you're the new chosen one.

3183
01:58:11.344 --> 01:58:15.560
BRIAN: That is all the time we have for...

3184
01:58:17.764 --> 01:58:19.795
I mean, I got a C-minus, but--

3185
01:58:19.795 --> 01:58:20.760
TRAVIS: Brand new record.

3186
01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.936
BRIAN: Brand new...

3187
01:58:22.936 --> 01:58:27.878
(dramatic music)

3188
01:58:29.011 --> 01:58:30.241
(sighs)

3189
01:58:30.241 --> 01:58:34.373
DANI: I just want to watch my Critical Role.

3190
01:58:34.373 --> 01:58:36.081
TALIESIN: For your consideration,

3191
01:58:36.081 --> 01:58:37.397
this is the face of a Critter

3192
01:58:37.397 --> 01:58:39.952
who's craving their Critical Role content.

3193
01:58:39.952 --> 01:58:42.184
But for this sanctimonious shipper,

3194
01:58:42.184 --> 01:58:45.046
time misled them like a trip to the Feywild.

3195
01:58:45.046 --> 01:58:48.199
They now have come face to face with existential dread,

3196
01:58:48.199 --> 01:58:51.413
a fear of sardonic spoilers.

3197
01:58:51.413 --> 01:58:53.748
Let us lead them across the bridge into a realm

3198
01:58:53.748 --> 01:58:56.385
of bright shadows where, even if one misses

3199
01:58:56.385 --> 01:58:58.855
the live viewing of their favorite program,

3200
01:58:58.855 --> 01:59:01.592
they can still watch it on demand if they bear the mark

3201
01:59:01.592 --> 01:59:04.296
of a Twitch subscription to the channel.

3202
01:59:04.296 --> 01:59:07.136
That mark, a mysterious sigil of emoticons

3203
01:59:07.136 --> 01:59:09.469
made by the sage, ArseQueef.

3204
01:59:10.545 --> 01:59:12.607
In this land of shadow known as

3205
01:59:12.607 --> 01:59:15.286
the Twitch Subscription Zone, no shipper,

3206
01:59:15.286 --> 01:59:18.266
fan ficcer, or please name my kitten litter Critter

3207
01:59:18.266 --> 01:59:21.038
has to feel like a bitter fritter.

3208
01:59:21.038 --> 01:59:24.101
And so ends another meandering digression,

3209
01:59:24.101 --> 01:59:27.557
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

3210
01:59:27.557 --> 01:59:28.965
to the region we call

3211
01:59:31.656 --> 01:59:34.273

(mysterious music)

3217
01:59:50.591 --> 01:59:54.841
You should check to see if you've left the oven on.

3218
01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:01.523
(dramatic music)

3219
02:12:52.181 --> 02:12:53.771
MATT: And welcome back.

3220
02:12:53.771 --> 02:12:57.403
So, before we jump back in, we have our winner

3221
02:12:57.403 --> 02:13:01.387
of our awesome Wyrmwood giveaway is-- I'm excited.

3222
02:13:01.387 --> 02:13:04.044
Congratulations to Poop_d_pants.

3223
02:13:04.044 --> 02:13:05.852
(laughter and cheering)

3224
02:13:05.852 --> 02:13:07.638
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for this!

3225
02:13:07.638 --> 02:13:11.246
MATT: That's poop, underscore, D,

3226
02:13:11.246 --> 02:13:13.629
underscore, pants.

3227
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:15.362
TALIESIN: Who may have just--

3228
02:13:15.362 --> 02:13:17.124
ALL: Poop de pants.

3229
02:13:17.124 --> 02:13:18.415
MATT: So congratulations, Poop_d_pants.

3230
02:13:18.415 --> 02:13:21.059
TALIESIN: Well done.
LIAM: Of the royal DePants family?

3231
02:13:21.059 --> 02:13:21.892
MATT: Yes, yes!

3232
02:13:21.892 --> 02:13:23.498
TALIESIN: Of the new England DePants.

3233
02:13:23.498 --> 02:13:25.142
TRAVIS: New England.

3234
02:13:25.142 --> 02:13:28.156
MATT: A familiar color scheme for your Bolivian rosewood

3235
02:13:28.156 --> 02:13:30.152
dice tower. Congratulations.

3236
02:13:30.152 --> 02:13:32.120
All righty.

3237
02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:32.970
So.

3238
02:13:33.854 --> 02:13:37.495
Also, to clarify, it's elven chain, not elven chain mail.

3239
02:13:37.495 --> 02:13:40.240
That was a vestige of me growing up with older editions

3240
02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:41.336
in which it was called elven chain mail.

3241
02:13:41.336 --> 02:13:45.065
But elven chain was the armor we were talking about.

3242
02:13:45.065 --> 02:13:48.841
So, you all gathered at Reani's home,

3243
02:13:48.841 --> 02:13:50.846
laid down for the evening for a night's rest,

3244
02:13:50.846 --> 02:13:54.779
and the

3245
02:13:54.779 --> 02:13:58.129
night comes to you.

3246
02:13:58.129 --> 02:13:59.353
Reani.

3247
02:13:59.353 --> 02:14:00.737
ALL: (gasping)

3248
02:14:00.737 --> 02:14:02.314
MARISHA: Oh shit.

3249
02:14:02.314 --> 02:14:06.472
MATT: Through a cupcake-induced

3250
02:14:06.472 --> 02:14:08.413
temporary sugar coma.

3251
02:14:08.413 --> 02:14:09.796
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3252
02:14:13.978 --> 02:14:17.561
MATT: The comfortable night darkness

3253
02:14:17.561 --> 02:14:19.411
restful sleep

3254
02:14:19.411 --> 02:14:23.494
is breached by a speck of light

3255
02:14:23.494 --> 02:14:26.710
that grows and grows until

3256
02:14:26.710 --> 02:14:31.126
the translucent, crystal and ethereal form

3257
02:14:31.126 --> 02:14:35.830
of Samliel apparates before you in your dream.

3258
02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:40.652
A vision that hasn't come to you in some time.

3259
02:14:40.652 --> 02:14:43.635
The wings unfurled, the calm smile

3260
02:14:43.635 --> 02:14:46.385
of the angelic entity before you.

3261
02:14:47.785 --> 02:14:51.327
He rests and sits beside you in this dark expanse.

3262
02:14:52.794 --> 02:14:53.819
"Reani."

3263
02:14:55.747 --> 02:14:57.367
MICA: Hi, Sam.

3264
02:14:57.367 --> 02:14:58.467
MATT: "Hello.

3265
02:14:59.945 --> 02:15:04.628
"So, what have you learned with the dragon?"

3266
02:15:06.745 --> 02:15:11.745
MICA: That sometimes you should

3267
02:15:11.761 --> 02:15:13.486
run away from things

3268
02:15:13.486 --> 02:15:14.903
and not fight it?

3269
02:15:15.898 --> 02:15:18.902
MATT: "That is a very important lesson."

3270
02:15:18.902 --> 02:15:20.749
MICA: Did you see, I lived.

3271
02:15:20.749 --> 02:15:23.182
MATT: "I see that now, and I saw it then,

3272
02:15:23.182 --> 02:15:24.220
and I'm proud of you."

3273
02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:25.553
MICA: Thanks.

3274
02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:28.998
Is that what I was supposed to learn?

3275
02:15:28.998 --> 02:15:31.163
Did I mess up, am I wrong?

3276
02:15:31.163 --> 02:15:32.565
MATT: "No.

3277
02:15:32.565 --> 02:15:34.065
"You did very well.

3278
02:15:35.684 --> 02:15:39.962
"There isn't so much a right way to do things,

3279
02:15:39.962 --> 02:15:42.545
"more than avoid the wrong way to do things,

3280
02:15:42.545 --> 02:15:47.545
"and take these lessons to heart as you learn them.

3281
02:15:48.133 --> 02:15:52.708
"And you've made companions,

3282
02:15:52.708 --> 02:15:57.708
"you've faced serious threat,

3283
02:15:57.977 --> 02:16:01.236
"and you've helped an old friend.

3284
02:16:02.702 --> 02:16:05.420
"Are you proud of yourself?"

3285
02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:06.805
MICA: I think I am.

3286
02:16:06.805 --> 02:16:09.959
I'm doing you proud, so I'm proud of myself, right?

3287
02:16:09.959 --> 02:16:11.058
MATT: "Good.

3288
02:16:11.058 --> 02:16:12.408
"You should be,

3289
02:16:13.597 --> 02:16:16.983
"but you should also be proud for yourself,

3290
02:16:16.983 --> 02:16:19.233
"regardless of what I think."

3291
02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:22.861
MICA: I don't get it.

3292
02:16:22.861 --> 02:16:26.902
MATT: "I've guided you for some time, and

3293
02:16:28.452 --> 02:16:32.544
"I just would hate to think

3294
02:16:32.544 --> 02:16:35.323
"that so much of your life is tethered to

3295
02:16:35.323 --> 02:16:38.631
"what my opinion

3296
02:16:38.631 --> 02:16:41.981
"or my interest may be."

3297
02:16:41.981 --> 02:16:45.770
MICA: But you're my angel, what do you mean?

3298
02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:47.933
MATT: "I am,

3299
02:16:47.933 --> 02:16:49.512
"and I'm not going anywhere."

3300
02:16:49.512 --> 02:16:50.429
MICA: Oh, okay.

3301
02:16:51.472 --> 02:16:55.222
MATT: "But don't wait for me, either.

3302
02:16:56.261 --> 02:16:58.336
"You're your own woman."

3303
02:17:02.273 --> 02:17:07.015
MICA: So what do I do, where do I go?

3304
02:17:08.489 --> 02:17:11.232
MATT: "That's your decision to make.

3305
02:17:11.232 --> 02:17:12.598
"I showed you a dragon,

3306
02:17:12.598 --> 02:17:15.133
"but you made the path yourself, yeah?"

3307
02:17:15.133 --> 02:17:16.466
MICA: Yeah.

3308
02:17:17.505 --> 02:17:20.373
MATT: "You can do that with other things in life."

3309
02:17:20.373 --> 02:17:21.847
MICA: Did I do something wrong?

3310
02:17:21.847 --> 02:17:22.871
MATT: "No."

3311
02:17:22.871 --> 02:17:24.222
MICA: Is that why you're going away?

3312
02:17:24.222 --> 02:17:25.456
MATT: "I'm not going away."

3313
02:17:25.456 --> 02:17:26.289
MICA: But...

3314
02:17:30.425 --> 02:17:32.299
I guess I'm scared.

3315
02:17:33.227 --> 02:17:35.025
MATT: "And that's okay.

3316
02:17:35.025 --> 02:17:37.147
"Scared is all right.

3317
02:17:37.147 --> 02:17:39.429
"Scared keeps us strong.

3318
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:42.596
"Scared helps us know who the enemy is."

3319
02:17:43.690 --> 02:17:46.819
MICA: And I'm still defeating the enemy, right?

3320
02:17:46.819 --> 02:17:48.152
MATT: "You have been.

3321
02:17:49.324 --> 02:17:53.064
"And there's more enemy out there to destroy."

3322
02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:54.070
MICA: Okay.

3323
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:55.942
MATT: "And I'll guide you towards the things

3324
02:17:55.942 --> 02:17:59.352
"that must be brought to ash."

3325
02:17:59.352 --> 02:18:00.382
MICA: Promise?

3326
02:18:00.382 --> 02:18:01.780
MATT: "I promise."

3327
02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:02.727
MICA: Okay.

3328
02:18:02.727 --> 02:18:03.801
Thank you.

3329
02:18:03.801 --> 02:18:05.801
MATT: "Of course.

3330
02:18:05.801 --> 02:18:10.143
"I just want you to know that I trust that the guidance

3331
02:18:10.143 --> 02:18:14.728
"I've given you to this point is strong enough to lead you

3332
02:18:14.728 --> 02:18:16.895
"whether or not I'm around.

3333
02:18:18.932 --> 02:18:23.932
"If you see injustice, if you see evil,

3334
02:18:24.088 --> 02:18:28.998
"if you see the darkness that creeps into the light,

3335
02:18:28.998 --> 02:18:32.607
"and I'm not there, do not hesitate."

3336
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:34.935
MICA: I promise.

3337
02:18:34.935 --> 02:18:37.752
MATT: "You're an extension of my weapon,

3338
02:18:37.752 --> 02:18:40.075
"and you've been sharpened further and further

3339
02:18:40.075 --> 02:18:41.625
"with each year."

3340
02:18:43.824 --> 02:18:46.811
MICA: I'll miss you if I don't get to see you a lot.

3341
02:18:46.811 --> 02:18:51.811
But I'll remember what you told me,

3342
02:18:51.982 --> 02:18:56.224
and I promise that evil will never win.

3343
02:18:57.204 --> 02:18:59.037
MATT: "I'm always watching."

3344
02:19:01.354 --> 02:19:06.231
MICA: I promise that I won't let you down,

3345
02:19:06.231 --> 02:19:09.148
and every time you look down at me,

3346
02:19:10.257 --> 02:19:14.638
everything I do will be for you, but also for me, right?

3347
02:19:14.638 --> 02:19:16.469
MATT: "For you are an extension of me."

3348
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:17.652
MICA: Exactly.

3349
02:19:17.652 --> 02:19:19.069
I think I get it.

3350
02:19:20.439 --> 02:19:24.392
MATT: "Your opinion is my own, if you learn this path

3351
02:19:24.392 --> 02:19:27.833
"as well as I believe you have.

3352
02:19:27.833 --> 02:19:32.700
"So know these choices you make, they're mine, as my own.

3353
02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:36.683
"Should it stray, I'll let you know."

3354
02:19:36.683 --> 02:19:37.516
MICA: Okay.

3355
02:19:37.516 --> 02:19:41.516
MATT: "But until then, take solace in that knowledge."

3356
02:19:42.490 --> 02:19:43.411
MICA: I will.

3357
02:19:43.411 --> 02:19:45.411
MATT: "And child, do not cry.

3358
02:19:47.493 --> 02:19:51.890
"Now, smite the shadows for me."

3359
02:19:51.890 --> 02:19:54.223
(wings flapping)

3360
02:19:57.554 --> 02:20:01.737
The feather trail cascades around you

3361
02:20:01.737 --> 02:20:03.654
as the warmth of your night's rest

3362
02:20:03.654 --> 02:20:07.432
carries you once more into darkness.

3363
02:20:07.432 --> 02:20:09.812
The morning comes to you all, you awaken

3364
02:20:09.812 --> 02:20:11.942
with cricks in your neck and your back

3365
02:20:11.942 --> 02:20:15.063
from the not well-supported floor

3366
02:20:15.063 --> 02:20:17.405
of the interior of the home.

3367
02:20:17.405 --> 02:20:19.204
MICA: Excuse me, I provided pillows.

3368
02:20:19.204 --> 02:20:20.787
MATT: You did, you did.

3369
02:20:22.533 --> 02:20:25.450
But nevertheless, the day is yours.

3370
02:20:26.995 --> 02:20:29.445
TRAVIS: That was not the best...

3371
02:20:31.543 --> 02:20:34.667
That was the best night's rest I've ever had.

3372
02:20:34.667 --> 02:20:36.537
Thank you, Reani.

3373
02:20:36.537 --> 02:20:38.453
MICA: Does anybody want breakfast?

3374
02:20:38.453 --> 02:20:41.448
TALIESIN: Oh, god, breakfast sounds great, let's do that.

3375
02:20:41.448 --> 02:20:42.754
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Cupcakes?

3376
02:20:42.754 --> 02:20:45.046
LAURA: Mm, cupcakes.

3377
02:20:46.029 --> 02:20:47.481
I actually think I may have had

3378
02:20:47.481 --> 02:20:49.614
a little too many last night and I feel

3379
02:20:49.614 --> 02:20:53.278
that maybe not cupcakes is maybe the best idea right now.

3380
02:20:53.278 --> 02:20:55.021
SAM: All right.

3381
02:20:55.021 --> 02:20:59.098
Can you make us something healthy, full of protein?

3382
02:20:59.098 --> 02:21:01.131
MICA: Do I have things in my fridge?

3383
02:21:01.131 --> 02:21:02.348
Do I have a fridge?

3384
02:21:02.348 --> 02:21:04.530
MATT: There isn't so much a fridge.

3385
02:21:04.530 --> 02:21:05.766
(laughter)

3386
02:21:05.766 --> 02:21:07.954
MICA: Does this world have fridges?

3387
02:21:07.954 --> 02:21:11.828
MATT: I mean, there are enchanted cold storage cases,

3388
02:21:11.828 --> 02:21:14.002
but you do not have one in your possession.

3389
02:21:14.002 --> 02:21:17.529
So the things that you would have would be

3390
02:21:17.529 --> 02:21:19.243
relatively fresh vegetables, if that would be something

3391
02:21:19.243 --> 02:21:20.635
you would acquire from the market,

3392
02:21:20.635 --> 02:21:22.415
you would have dried salted meats,

3393
02:21:22.415 --> 02:21:24.163
things that are cured and meant to, you know,

3394
02:21:24.163 --> 02:21:27.257
have a prolonged long life before consumption.

3395
02:21:27.257 --> 02:21:28.597
TALIESIN: Lentils.

3396
02:21:28.597 --> 02:21:29.648
MATT: Yeah.

3397
02:21:29.648 --> 02:21:33.456
Beans, a lot of root-based and

3398
02:21:33.456 --> 02:21:36.722
tuber-like vegetation,

3399
02:21:36.722 --> 02:21:39.759
a lot of the Uthodurnian food is based in tubers, so.

3400
02:21:39.759 --> 02:21:42.143
MICA: So I guess with what I have stored in the house

3401
02:21:42.143 --> 02:21:44.720
that's still good, I'll try and whip together

3402
02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:45.641
as much as I can.

3403
02:21:45.641 --> 02:21:47.147
MATT: Very much a classic southern

3404
02:21:47.147 --> 02:21:49.018
throw-it-all-in breakfast.

3405
02:21:49.018 --> 02:21:50.310
MICA: Yeah.

3406
02:21:50.310 --> 02:21:53.927
MATT: So the breakfast mash is completed, cooked,

3407
02:21:53.927 --> 02:21:57.345
it's not pretty, but it's pretty tasty.

3408
02:21:57.345 --> 02:21:58.945
LAURA: Mm.

3409
02:22:00.903 --> 02:22:03.904
MATT: Some familiar Caduceus spices thrown in.

3410
02:22:03.904 --> 02:22:05.711
A little bit of flavor on top of the Reani special.

3411
02:22:05.711 --> 02:22:07.125
TALIESIN: You can do a lot with broccoli.

3412
02:22:07.125 --> 02:22:08.313
LAURA: (laughs)

3413
02:22:08.313 --> 02:22:09.412
No.

3414
02:22:09.412 --> 02:22:10.775
MATT: Hey.

3415
02:22:10.775 --> 02:22:12.782
TALIESIN and MATT: Don't knock broccoli.

3416
02:22:12.782 --> 02:22:14.350
MICA: Broccoli's the boss.

3417
02:22:14.350 --> 02:22:17.500
LIAM: So today we are going to break into a home,

3418
02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:20.567
is the idea, to liberate?

3419
02:22:20.567 --> 02:22:22.854
SAM: The ring, so we can get the thing that we need to

3420
02:22:22.854 --> 02:22:25.892
go to the forge and make the sword,

3421
02:22:25.892 --> 02:22:27.717
and do any other business.

3422
02:22:27.717 --> 02:22:28.550
LAURA: Let's do it!

3423
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:29.383
SAM: All right.

3424
02:22:29.383 --> 02:22:33.932
TRAVIS: Well, all of us or just a small, covert fashion?

3425
02:22:33.932 --> 02:22:35.102
SAM: Are you scared?

3426
02:22:35.102 --> 02:22:36.260
TRAVIS: No, I just don't know.

3427
02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:37.717
TALIESIN: I think it's good to have a few people

3428
02:22:37.717 --> 02:22:39.606
on stand by, maybe, if we do something like this.

3429
02:22:39.606 --> 02:22:42.826
LAURA: We should definitely have at least,

3430
02:22:43.667 --> 02:22:46.607
I would say one of the two of you go in.

3431
02:22:46.607 --> 02:22:47.713
SAM: For the message?

3432
02:22:47.713 --> 02:22:48.980
LAURA: So you guys can send messages back and forth.

3433
02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:50.147
SAM: What's this?

3434
02:22:51.552 --> 02:22:52.654
LAURA: I don't know.

3435
02:22:52.654 --> 02:22:53.651
SAM: Because we can hear each other.

3436
02:22:53.651 --> 02:22:55.191
LAURA: Because you can hear each other really well

3437
02:22:55.191 --> 02:22:57.681
with your messages that you send to each other.

3438
02:22:57.681 --> 02:23:01.748
TRAVIS: I stay outside, obviously,
because I am not very sneaky.

3439
02:23:01.748 --> 02:23:05.163
MARISHA: Perhaps you could be a good excuse

3440
02:23:05.163 --> 02:23:07.845
to distract the guards, get their attention,

3441
02:23:07.845 --> 02:23:09.499
talk to them at the gates?

3442
02:23:09.499 --> 02:23:11.475
TRAVIS: Love to do that, back to my old tricks.

3443
02:23:11.475 --> 02:23:13.779
MICA: Is he going to flirt with them?

3444
02:23:13.779 --> 02:23:18.148
LAURA: He's got a really, we call it a silver tongue.

3445
02:23:18.148 --> 02:23:19.485
MARISHA: Yeah.

3446
02:23:19.485 --> 02:23:23.250
MICA: Are you going to marry the guards?

3447
02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:25.280
TRAVIS: Don't count it out just yet, yeah.

3448
02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:26.722
LAURA: He could talk them into marrying him,

3449
02:23:26.722 --> 02:23:27.779
if he wanted to.

3450
02:23:27.779 --> 02:23:29.333
MICA: Well then, we could walk right in the front door,

3451
02:23:29.333 --> 02:23:31.483
why wasn't that our first plan?

3452
02:23:31.483 --> 02:23:34.413
SAM: That only works for one guard, though.

3453
02:23:34.413 --> 02:23:37.537
MICA: It could work with two.

3454
02:23:37.537 --> 02:23:40.427
MATT: Polyamory is not something uncommon

3455
02:23:40.427 --> 02:23:43.487
in some places in Exandria.

3456
02:23:43.487 --> 02:23:45.052
MICA: So is this our first plan or are we going

3457
02:23:45.052 --> 02:23:46.110
back to the whole like--

3458
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:47.474
SAM: He's going to distract the front guard.

3459
02:23:47.474 --> 02:23:49.422
TALIESIN: I like the sneaky going up through the roof.

3460
02:23:49.422 --> 02:23:50.366
SAM: We're going in through the roof,

3461
02:23:50.366 --> 02:23:52.109
maybe you could fly us up there,

3462
02:23:52.109 --> 02:23:55.330
or maybe you could bamf us up there, or maybe a little--

3463
02:23:55.330 --> 02:23:58.300
LAURA: Oh it might be good for-- oh, I do. I have--

3464
02:23:58.300 --> 02:23:59.985
hold on, let me look.

3465
02:23:59.985 --> 02:24:03.368
How many times can I bamf us, man?

3466
02:24:03.368 --> 02:24:04.950
SAM: Dimension Door?

3467
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:07.507
LAURA: Yeah, I could bamf us a couple times.

3468
02:24:07.507 --> 02:24:09.554
I can bamf me and one other person

3469
02:24:09.554 --> 02:24:10.420
a couple times.

3470
02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:13.570
MICA: Whoever is not being bamfed, I can fly.

3471
02:24:14.528 --> 02:24:16.195
SAM: Yeah, that's true.

3472
02:24:17.734 --> 02:24:20.528
We can climb, I can be invisible and climb,

3473
02:24:20.528 --> 02:24:22.137
a few of us can get up on the roof.

3474
02:24:22.137 --> 02:24:23.278
MARISHA: Yeah.

3475
02:24:23.278 --> 02:24:28.195
Maybe I can stay on the roof and just stand guard up there?

3476
02:24:29.078 --> 02:24:31.412
LAURA: How are we going to get up on the roof?

3477
02:24:31.412 --> 02:24:33.594
LIAM: Well, I can bat myself up there.

3478
02:24:33.594 --> 02:24:34.767
LAURA: I can bat myself up there.

3479
02:24:34.767 --> 02:24:38.132
MARISHA: I can fly on Reani's owl form again.
MICA: I can carry Beau.

3480
02:24:38.132 --> 02:24:41.012
LIAM: A giant owl is very noticeable, though.

3481
02:24:41.012 --> 02:24:41.845
LAURA: Yes.

3482
02:24:41.845 --> 02:24:42.678
MATT: Just so you're aware, it is roughly

3483
02:24:42.678 --> 02:24:43.713
like five in the morning.

3484
02:24:43.713 --> 02:24:45.732
You guys went to bed relatively early,

3485
02:24:45.732 --> 02:24:47.697
so you can get up early.

3486
02:24:47.697 --> 02:24:50.043
So just letting you know, it's still the crack of dawn.

3487
02:24:50.043 --> 02:24:51.041
LAURA: Yeah, I was thinking we would be waking up

3488
02:24:51.041 --> 02:24:53.729
at like two, I didn't realize it would be like--

3489
02:24:53.729 --> 02:24:55.475
MARISHA: We overslept?
LAURA: Yeah.

3490
02:24:55.475 --> 02:24:56.318
SAM: That's still good, though.

3491
02:24:56.318 --> 02:24:57.966
MATT: To get an eight-hour full rest.

3492
02:24:57.966 --> 02:24:58.799
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: We can maybe strike

3493
02:24:58.799 --> 02:25:01.924
before lots of people are out on the streets and stuff.

3494
02:25:01.924 --> 02:25:04.145
TALIESIN: We could go and do this right now.

3495
02:25:04.145 --> 02:25:06.169
SAM: Yeah, be done by 10:00am and still have

3496
02:25:06.169 --> 02:25:07.255
a full day ahead of us.

3497
02:25:07.255 --> 02:25:08.321
TRAVIS: Do you want the dagger?

3498
02:25:08.321 --> 02:25:10.896
To, you know, lock any doors behind you.

3499
02:25:10.896 --> 02:25:12.954
It requires attunement.

3500
02:25:12.954 --> 02:25:14.250
SAM: You need it.

3501
02:25:14.250 --> 02:25:16.694
TRAVIS: I have a sword, it's fine.

3502
02:25:16.694 --> 02:25:18.582
SAM: Yeah?
TRAVIS: Yes.

3503
02:25:18.582 --> 02:25:20.589
SAM: What if you need to come in?

3504
02:25:20.589 --> 02:25:23.343
TRAVIS: It doesn't unlock, it just locks behind you.

3505
02:25:23.343 --> 02:25:25.622
SAM: I understand, but what if you need to come in

3506
02:25:25.622 --> 02:25:28.708
the front door, because we need you?

3507
02:25:28.708 --> 02:25:29.805
You could come in the front door

3508
02:25:29.805 --> 02:25:32.197
and make sure nobody else does.

3509
02:25:32.197 --> 02:25:33.511
LAURA: But the guards.

3510
02:25:33.511 --> 02:25:35.101
MARISHA: He's going to be distracting the guards, hopefully.

3511
02:25:35.101 --> 02:25:39.348
SAM: If everything turns to shit, as many of our plans do,

3512
02:25:39.348 --> 02:25:42.253
he might need to run in the door.

3513
02:25:42.253 --> 02:25:43.986
MARISHA: I'll be there to run in the door.

3514
02:25:43.986 --> 02:25:44.819
SAM: Hmm?

3515
02:25:44.819 --> 02:25:46.955
MARISHA: I'll be there to run in the door.

3516
02:25:46.955 --> 02:25:50.942
TRAVIS: ♪ I'll be there to comfort you ♪

3517
02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:52.608
LAURA: Oh god.

3518
02:25:52.608 --> 02:25:54.040
Oh god.

3519
02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:57.707
Okay, let's just walk over there, okay, guys?

3520
02:25:59.201 --> 02:26:00.380
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go.

3521
02:26:00.380 --> 02:26:02.319
MARISHA: Yeah.

3522
02:26:02.319 --> 02:26:03.368
MATT: All right, so.

3523
02:26:03.368 --> 02:26:05.444
SAM: We have a plan.
MICA: Do we?

3524
02:26:05.444 --> 02:26:06.279
MARISHA: Yeah.

3525
02:26:06.279 --> 02:26:08.587
SAM: This is as good as it gets.

3526
02:26:08.587 --> 02:26:11.700
LAURA: I think we should have four people in there.

3527
02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:13.853
No more than that.

3528
02:26:13.853 --> 02:26:16.250
Any more than that, it feels like it's getting

3529
02:26:16.250 --> 02:26:17.923
too many people in this house.

3530
02:26:17.923 --> 02:26:19.734
MARISHA: Yeah.

3531
02:26:19.734 --> 02:26:21.995
LAURA: We can do two people as bats.

3532
02:26:21.995 --> 02:26:23.955
TRAVIS: Raise your hand if you're bats.

3533
02:26:23.955 --> 02:26:26.313
LAURA: You can be a bat, you can be a bat.

3534
02:26:26.313 --> 02:26:30.227
I can Dimension Door one other person up to the roof.

3535
02:26:30.227 --> 02:26:32.432
TRAVIS: Nott and Jester.

3536
02:26:32.432 --> 02:26:33.660
LAURA: All right.

3537
02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:34.493
SAM: All right.

3538
02:26:34.493 --> 02:26:36.576
Wait, what about Beauregard? Oh, you're staying with Fjord

3539
02:26:36.576 --> 02:26:37.956
or you're staying on the roof.

3540
02:26:37.956 --> 02:26:39.802
LIAM: She's got to get to the roof.

3541
02:26:39.802 --> 02:26:43.620
MARISHA: I'll climb, is climbing a good idea?

3542
02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:44.812
LIAM: I don't think so, I think you--

3543
02:26:44.812 --> 02:26:46.134
SAM: I can make you invisible.

3544
02:26:46.134 --> 02:26:47.165
LIAM: Take two trips?

3545
02:26:47.165 --> 02:26:48.964
MARISHA: (gasping)

3546
02:26:48.964 --> 02:26:51.382
MARISHA: I've always wanted this.

3547
02:26:51.382 --> 02:26:52.215
TRAVIS: What?

3548
02:26:52.215 --> 02:26:53.856
MARISHA: I've just been waiting for you to offer.

3549
02:26:53.856 --> 02:26:55.059
SAM: I can make you invisible.

3550
02:26:55.059 --> 02:26:56.920
MARISHA: I've just been waiting.

3551
02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:59.213
SAM: Well, today's your lucky day,

3552
02:26:59.213 --> 02:27:02.798
Beauregard Lafayette. What's your last name?

3553
02:27:02.798 --> 02:27:05.353
MATT: I think you were temporarily invisible last session,

3554
02:27:05.353 --> 02:27:07.523
and you broke it when you attacked the rope.

3555
02:27:07.523 --> 02:27:09.539
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that only lasted for like a second.

3556
02:27:09.539 --> 02:27:12.010
I won't squander it this time.
SAM: She's been waiting for it again.

3557
02:27:12.010 --> 02:27:14.649
MARISHA: I got the taste.
TRAVIS: She'll squander it super quick.

3558
02:27:14.649 --> 02:27:15.915
Super quick.

3559
02:27:15.915 --> 02:27:18.051
TALIESIN: Broken before it's cast.

3560
02:27:18.051 --> 02:27:20.131
MATT: So who is staying behind?

3561
02:27:20.131 --> 02:27:21.369
TALIESIN: Kind of wish I wasn't, but.

3562
02:27:21.369 --> 02:27:22.985
MATT: Fjord, Caduceus.
SAM: You want to go in?

3563
02:27:22.985 --> 02:27:24.019
You can go in.

3564
02:27:24.019 --> 02:27:26.924
TALIESIN: I mean, I trust everybody's plan,

3565
02:27:26.924 --> 02:27:28.127
I'm going to trust what the plan is.

3566
02:27:28.127 --> 02:27:28.960
SAM: There is no plan,

3567
02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:32.277
we would like to have you inside.
LAURA: We could all go in.

3568
02:27:32.277 --> 02:27:33.218
You want to go in?

3569
02:27:33.218 --> 02:27:34.217
TALIESIN: I'll go in.

3570
02:27:34.217 --> 02:27:35.406
LAURA: How are you going to get in?

3571
02:27:35.406 --> 02:27:36.571
TALIESIN: I don't know.

3572
02:27:36.571 --> 02:27:38.340
LAURA: Okay, we've got to figure that out, then.

3573
02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:40.990
MICA: Wait, Nott, how many people can you make invisible?

3574
02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:42.508
SAM: One.

3575
02:27:42.508 --> 02:27:43.341
MICA: Shit.

3576
02:27:43.341 --> 02:27:46.370
LIAM: But Caleb can make more than one person invisible.

3577
02:27:46.370 --> 02:27:49.103
MICA: (gasps) Okay, make me invisible,

3578
02:27:49.103 --> 02:27:50.627
and make a person I carry,

3579
02:27:50.627 --> 02:27:53.889
you can make Pinky invisible so I can carry Pinky up

3580
02:27:53.889 --> 02:27:55.685
onto the roof with me.

3581
02:27:55.685 --> 02:27:57.182
SAM: You can just sneak up there, you good.

3582
02:27:57.182 --> 02:27:59.498
MICA: And Beau is really good at what Beau does,

3583
02:27:59.498 --> 02:28:02.006
so Beau can sneak up there on Beau's own.

3584
02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:05.487
And then you can turn into a bat.

3585
02:28:05.487 --> 02:28:07.436
(laughter)

3586
02:28:07.436 --> 02:28:09.361
LIAM: I cannot turn into a bat

3587
02:28:09.361 --> 02:28:12.069
if I am keeping people invisible.

3588
02:28:14.723 --> 02:28:16.908
SAM: Is that true?
LIAM: Yes.

3589
02:28:16.908 --> 02:28:20.524
LAURA: I think we can only bring four people to the roof.

3590
02:28:20.524 --> 02:28:24.664
MICA: I just don't want to leave anybody out.

3591
02:28:24.664 --> 02:28:27.490
TALIESIN: I'll stay on the ground.

3592
02:28:27.490 --> 02:28:28.587
That's okay, I'll stay on the ground.

3593
02:28:28.587 --> 02:28:30.642
LAURA: But we do need--
SAM: Well, forget invisibility.

3594
02:28:30.642 --> 02:28:32.963
If Fjord goes and talks to those guards,

3595
02:28:32.963 --> 02:28:34.669
they're going to have eyes on him, we could just

3596
02:28:34.669 --> 02:28:37.768
fly up to the roof. We don't have to be invisible,

3597
02:28:37.768 --> 02:28:40.378
let's not mess with that, let's not complicate the plan.

3598
02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:43.066
He makes a distraction, five of us fly to the roof,

3599
02:28:43.066 --> 02:28:44.571
that's it.
TALIESIN: Pass Without a Trace.

3600
02:28:44.571 --> 02:28:46.876
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh my god.

3601
02:28:46.876 --> 02:28:48.958
SAM: It's five in the morning, no one's looking for birds,

3602
02:28:48.958 --> 02:28:51.252
we're underground.

3603
02:28:51.252 --> 02:28:52.576
MICA: "No one's looking for birds."

3604
02:28:52.576 --> 02:28:54.364
LIAM: Well, I'll tell you what.

3605
02:28:54.364 --> 02:28:57.998
I could make a group invisible and let them

3606
02:28:57.998 --> 02:28:59.829
make their way to the back of the house,

3607
02:28:59.829 --> 02:29:01.337
out of the sights of the guards,

3608
02:29:01.337 --> 02:29:02.417
you included, yeah.
LAURA: To the side of the house,

3609
02:29:02.417 --> 02:29:03.792
there's no back.

3610
02:29:03.792 --> 02:29:04.625
LIAM: That's what I mean,

3611
02:29:04.625 --> 02:29:06.771
back along the backside of the wall,

3612
02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:09.339
and then you go with, and when you're there,

3613
02:29:09.339 --> 02:29:12.134
you let me know that they are there, and I drop it,

3614
02:29:12.134 --> 02:29:16.210
and you are visible again, but out of the way of view,

3615
02:29:16.210 --> 02:29:17.676
and then I could bat it up.

3616
02:29:17.676 --> 02:29:19.066
SAM: Let's do it.
MICA: Question.

3617
02:29:19.066 --> 02:29:20.762
MARISHA: Then are you going to stay with Fjord,

3618
02:29:20.762 --> 02:29:23.455
that way as he's distracting the guards,

3619
02:29:23.455 --> 02:29:27.644
we know when to drop invisibility and then go from there?

3620
02:29:27.644 --> 02:29:29.391
LIAM: He doesn't need to distract the guards,

3621
02:29:29.391 --> 02:29:31.185
because I will make a handful of people invisible

3622
02:29:31.185 --> 02:29:32.076
to go to the--

3623
02:29:32.076 --> 02:29:35.959
LAURA: We can all go in together, and be caught together.

3624
02:29:35.959 --> 02:29:37.147
It'll be fun.

3625
02:29:37.147 --> 02:29:39.024
We'll go to jail as a group, you guys.

3626
02:29:39.024 --> 02:29:41.757
TRAVIS: I won't make a distraction
unless I hear shit breaking

3627
02:29:41.757 --> 02:29:43.234
and assuming things are going wrong.

3628
02:29:43.234 --> 02:29:47.918
LIAM: I do think we want people outdoors for problems.

3629
02:29:47.918 --> 02:29:50.735
MICA: Just to have another option other than flying,

3630
02:29:50.735 --> 02:29:52.613
if I'm a giant constrictor snake,

3631
02:29:52.613 --> 02:29:55.110
would my length be as tall as the building

3632
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:58.002
so they could walk up me?

3633
02:29:58.002 --> 02:30:00.197
How tall is a giant constrictor snake?

3634
02:30:00.197 --> 02:30:03.265
MATT: A giant constrictor snake is considered

3635
02:30:03.265 --> 02:30:07.728
a large creature coiled, which I'd say--

3636
02:30:07.728 --> 02:30:08.885
MICA: So uncoiled.

3637
02:30:08.885 --> 02:30:11.458
MATT: Uncoiled, I'd say it'd be 30 feet length

3638
02:30:11.458 --> 02:30:13.575
from nose to tip of tail.

3639
02:30:13.575 --> 02:30:15.243
MICA: How tall is 30 feet?

3640
02:30:15.243 --> 02:30:18.051
MATT: 30 feet.

3641
02:30:18.051 --> 02:30:20.619
LAURA: We could all be invisible and climbing

3642
02:30:20.619 --> 02:30:23.940
an invisible boa constrictor.

3643
02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:25.225
But we also could just--

3644
02:30:25.225 --> 02:30:28.034
MICA: If we're all invisible, I'll just fly you up.

3645
02:30:28.034 --> 02:30:29.133
LAURA: If we're all invisible,

3646
02:30:29.133 --> 02:30:30.602
we could use a rope.
MATT: ♪ D&amp;D. ♪

3647
02:30:30.602 --> 02:30:31.435
MICA: Yeah.

3648
02:30:31.435 --> 02:30:33.685
TALIESIN: [inaudible]

3649
02:30:35.544 --> 02:30:36.944
MICA: I don't know that came to me,

3650
02:30:36.944 --> 02:30:39.044
I just put that out there.

3651
02:30:39.044 --> 02:30:41.335
TALIESIN: No, it was a good--
MATT: (exaggerated Russian accent) So what is plan?

3652
02:30:41.335 --> 02:30:42.168
TRAVIS: What is plan,

3653
02:30:42.168 --> 02:30:43.176
for fuck's sake?
LAURA: We go, and

3654
02:30:43.176 --> 02:30:44.749
Caleb's going to make us all invisible.

3655
02:30:44.749 --> 02:30:45.908
SAM: We're going to scurry to the roof.

3656
02:30:45.908 --> 02:30:47.184
LAURA: Scurry up to the roof.

3657
02:30:47.184 --> 02:30:48.017
MATT: Okay.

3658
02:30:48.017 --> 02:30:49.513
MICA: Am I flying, are we flying?

3659
02:30:49.513 --> 02:30:51.052
LAURA: We'll figure it out.

3660
02:30:51.052 --> 02:30:52.821
MARISHA: No, we'll figure it out as we go.

3661
02:30:52.821 --> 02:30:55.017
LIAM: I can make four people invisible.

3662
02:30:55.017 --> 02:30:57.083
MICA: I can bring three people at once.

3663
02:30:57.083 --> 02:30:58.970
TALIESIN: Yeah, so two trips, invisible,

3664
02:30:58.970 --> 02:31:00.123
would get everybody up there.

3665
02:31:00.123 --> 02:31:01.706
MICA: Yeah.

3666
02:31:01.706 --> 02:31:04.075
LIAM: I'll send you off, and you'll message me.

3667
02:31:04.075 --> 02:31:05.005
TALIESIN: We have a flyer.

3668
02:31:05.005 --> 02:31:07.405
LAURA: You're staying behind with Fjord.

3669
02:31:07.405 --> 02:31:09.152
LIAM: Momentarily.

3670
02:31:09.152 --> 02:31:12.089
Once you are back there, I'm going to turn into a bat

3671
02:31:12.089 --> 02:31:13.207
and make my way up there.

3672
02:31:13.207 --> 02:31:16.121
SAM: Why don't you make these four,

3673
02:31:16.121 --> 02:31:19.936
Beau, Reani, Caduceus, Jester, invisible,

3674
02:31:19.936 --> 02:31:23.558
I'll take care of me, and we'll scurry to the roof.

3675
02:31:23.558 --> 02:31:24.391
MARISHA: All right.

3676
02:31:24.391 --> 02:31:25.815
SAM: On three, go.

3677
02:31:25.815 --> 02:31:27.208
LIAM: Beau, Reani, Jester, and Caduceus?

3678
02:31:27.208 --> 02:31:28.454
TALIESIN: Are we there?

3679
02:31:28.454 --> 02:31:31.481
TRAVIS: Why did you say "on three," and then not count?

3680
02:31:31.481 --> 02:31:32.916
MARISHA: On three, go.

3681
02:31:32.916 --> 02:31:33.865
SAM: It was implied.

3682
02:31:33.865 --> 02:31:34.699
TRAVIS: Ah.

3683
02:31:34.699 --> 02:31:35.801
MATT: It's a silent three.

3684
02:31:35.801 --> 02:31:38.686
TALIESIN: We're not at the house yet, are we?

3685
02:31:38.686 --> 02:31:42.462
LAURA: No, we were on our way, though.

3686
02:31:42.462 --> 02:31:44.545
MATT: Okay, so you're quietly conversing

3687
02:31:44.545 --> 02:31:47.401
as you're making your way--
LAURA: Just like assholes.

3688
02:31:47.401 --> 02:31:48.997
MATT: -- towards the Demerant Circle.

3689
02:31:48.997 --> 02:31:51.237
TALIESIN: I just want to say that this is good work.

3690
02:31:51.237 --> 02:31:53.700
That we are doing the work of the Wildmother,

3691
02:31:53.700 --> 02:31:56.549
we are on a path of destiny, we are here to make

3692
02:31:56.549 --> 02:31:59.799
a friend stronger, we're here to help me fulfill

3693
02:31:59.799 --> 02:32:01.278
what I need to do, and I just want to say

3694
02:32:01.278 --> 02:32:06.278
I'm so grateful for all of you, for what you've given

3695
02:32:06.381 --> 02:32:11.302
of yourselves to this, to this, honestly this long shot,

3696
02:32:11.302 --> 02:32:15.041
this leap of faith that we're all making is just great.

3697
02:32:15.041 --> 02:32:17.079
And I cast Motivational Speech.

3698
02:32:17.079 --> 02:32:19.642
LAURA: Yeah!
(cheering)

3699
02:32:19.642 --> 02:32:21.699
MATT: You <i>cast</i> Motivational Speech?

3700
02:32:21.699 --> 02:32:22.802
TALIESIN: I have Motivational Speech.

3701
02:32:22.802 --> 02:32:24.984
I'm going to give a Motivational Speech

3702
02:32:24.984 --> 02:32:29.368
to one, two, three, how many can I do?

3703
02:32:33.085 --> 02:32:34.585
One, two, three.

3704
02:32:36.516 --> 02:32:37.641
Choose up to five.

3705
02:32:37.641 --> 02:32:42.641
So one, two, three, four, five.

3706
02:32:42.721 --> 02:32:44.049
MARISHA: (groaning)

3707
02:32:44.049 --> 02:32:45.142
TALIESIN: You're fine.

3708
02:32:45.142 --> 02:32:45.975
(laughter)

3709
02:32:45.975 --> 02:32:47.220
MICA: Get wrecked.

3710
02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:48.707
LAURA: So what do we get from this?

3711
02:32:48.707 --> 02:32:51.282
TALIESIN: You get five temporary hit points.

3712
02:32:51.282 --> 02:32:53.510
LAURA: Yay.
MICA: Ooh.

3713
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:55.155
MARISHA: Your speech was stupid anyway.

3714
02:32:55.155 --> 02:32:57.237
TALIESIN: I know, you didn't like it anyway.

3715
02:32:57.237 --> 02:32:58.700
You get five temporary hit points,

3716
02:32:58.700 --> 02:33:02.689
you get advantage on wisdom saving throws, for an hour.

3717
02:33:02.689 --> 02:33:03.522
LAURA: Wow!

3718
02:33:03.522 --> 02:33:06.056
TALIESIN: And if you are hit by an attack,

3719
02:33:06.056 --> 02:33:10.197
you have advantage on the next attack roll you make.

3720
02:33:10.197 --> 02:33:12.065
MATT: I was like, "I remember that from one of the books."

3721
02:33:12.065 --> 02:33:13.993
Ah, it's in the Acquisitions Incorporated book,

3722
02:33:13.993 --> 02:33:15.774
that makes complete sense.

3723
02:33:15.774 --> 02:33:18.520
TRAVIS: Motivational Speech, yeah.
MATT: Makes total sense, yep.

3724
02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:19.437
SAM: Advantage on?

3725
02:33:19.437 --> 02:33:21.548
TALIESIN: Advantage on wisdom saving throws,

3726
02:33:21.548 --> 02:33:23.698
and if you get hit by an attack,

3727
02:33:23.698 --> 02:33:25.830
your next attack has advantage.

3728
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:26.969
MARISHA: That's cool.

3729
02:33:26.969 --> 02:33:28.625
TRAVIS: That's real cool.
MATT: Perfect.

3730
02:33:28.625 --> 02:33:29.995
SAM: Okay.

3731
02:33:29.995 --> 02:33:30.911
MATT: All righty, so.

3732
02:33:30.911 --> 02:33:35.751
MARISHA: As we're walking, I scuttle up to Fjord.

3733
02:33:35.751 --> 02:33:38.717
Hey, you know,

3734
02:33:38.717 --> 02:33:41.596
if you want to, you know,

3735
02:33:41.596 --> 02:33:44.420
if like at nights and stuff or in our spare time,

3736
02:33:44.420 --> 02:33:47.091
if you want me to like, teach you some basics.

3737
02:33:47.091 --> 02:33:51.691
It takes like a long time to, you know,

3738
02:33:51.691 --> 02:33:55.973
train in this shit, but you know, personally,

3739
02:33:55.973 --> 02:33:58.192
I'm a firm believer that everyone should have

3740
02:33:58.192 --> 02:34:00.492
like the basics of self-defense, you know?

3741
02:34:00.492 --> 02:34:01.735
TRAVIS: A good foundation?

3742
02:34:01.735 --> 02:34:02.980
MARISHA: Totally.
TRAVIS: Right.

3743
02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:06.895
MARISHA: So if you want, you know, I always do

3744
02:34:06.895 --> 02:34:08.593
like my morning routine anyway,

3745
02:34:08.593 --> 02:34:10.425
you're always more than welcome to join for that.

3746
02:34:10.425 --> 02:34:13.022
TRAVIS: I lose count after like 75 of those push-ups.

3747
02:34:13.022 --> 02:34:16.262
I don't know how you expect me to be able to hang with that.

3748
02:34:16.262 --> 02:34:19.628
MARISHA: Oh, well no, you just work up to it, man, you know?

3749
02:34:19.628 --> 02:34:21.274
You shouldn't be down on yourself.

3750
02:34:21.274 --> 02:34:22.116
TRAVIS: Right.

3751
02:34:22.116 --> 02:34:23.813
The sit-ups I also have to do?

3752
02:34:23.813 --> 02:34:24.646
MARISHA: Yeah.

3753
02:34:24.646 --> 02:34:25.910
TRAVIS: And the pull-ups?

3754
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:29.875
MARISHA: Yeah, when your body is your weapon,

3755
02:34:29.875 --> 02:34:32.520
everything needs to be in tip-top shape.

3756
02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:35.477
TRAVIS: I tried that once, I saw and then I went and did it,

3757
02:34:35.477 --> 02:34:38.532
and I couldn't, my everything hurt for two days.

3758
02:34:38.532 --> 02:34:39.825
MARISHA: Yeah.

3759
02:34:39.825 --> 02:34:41.481
TRAVIS: Like rusty hinge.

3760
02:34:41.481 --> 02:34:43.791
MARISHA: That's like every day of my life.

3761
02:34:43.791 --> 02:34:44.709
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

3762
02:34:44.709 --> 02:34:47.107
God, you don't show it.

3763
02:34:47.107 --> 02:34:50.006
MARISHA: The pain kind of turns me on just a little bit.

3764
02:34:50.006 --> 02:34:52.585
Don't tell anybody that.

3765
02:34:52.585 --> 02:34:55.824
(laughter)

3766
02:34:55.824 --> 02:34:56.985
TRAVIS: Okay.

3767
02:34:58.222 --> 02:35:00.338
MARISHA: I hope that doesn't

3768
02:35:00.338 --> 02:35:01.955
dissuade you to come work out with me?

3769
02:35:01.955 --> 02:35:03.257
TRAVIS: Not at all.

3770
02:35:03.257 --> 02:35:04.810
(laughter)

3771
02:35:04.810 --> 02:35:06.657
Not at all.

3772
02:35:06.657 --> 02:35:10.998
I will be focused at the task at hand

3773
02:35:10.998 --> 02:35:15.363
and not at all thinking about you feeling--

3774
02:35:15.363 --> 02:35:17.302
MARISHA: No, you don't have to

3775
02:35:17.302 --> 02:35:19.498
TRAVIS: I will take you up--
MARISHA: Don't think about--

3776
02:35:19.498 --> 02:35:23.064
MATT: As you arrive at the crossroads where you had

3777
02:35:23.064 --> 02:35:28.055
previously staked out amongst the stone seats,

3778
02:35:29.054 --> 02:35:33.879
within visual range of the Tumblecarve residence.

3779
02:35:34.774 --> 02:35:36.007
Fjord, you are staying behind,

3780
02:35:36.007 --> 02:35:38.254
Caleb, you are at the moment staying behind.

3781
02:35:38.254 --> 02:35:41.257
The rest of you are, you are casting Invisibility

3782
02:35:41.257 --> 02:35:44.143
on all but--
LIAM: On...

3783
02:35:44.143 --> 02:35:46.301
LAURA: Wait, before you do it, I cast Pass Without a Trace

3784
02:35:46.301 --> 02:35:47.134
on all of us.

3785
02:35:47.134 --> 02:35:48.224
LIAM: Okay.

3786
02:35:48.224 --> 02:35:52.233
And is going to, Beauregard is going,

3787
02:35:52.233 --> 02:35:55.930
Nott is going. Caduceus, where do you want to be

3788
02:35:55.930 --> 02:35:57.596
in this disaster?
TALIESIN: I think I'd like to come.

3789
02:35:57.596 --> 02:36:00.865
I tried to--
LIAM: Okay, so one, two, three.

3790
02:36:00.865 --> 02:36:03.855
SAM: I can do it on myself, so skip me and do Reani.

3791
02:36:03.855 --> 02:36:06.748
MICA: I'm the giant bird carrying things.

3792
02:36:06.748 --> 02:36:10.053
LIAM: You want to turn into a giant flying creature?

3793
02:36:10.053 --> 02:36:11.447
MICA: An invisible one.

3794
02:36:11.447 --> 02:36:12.915
MARISHA: Invisible giant flying creature.

3795
02:36:12.915 --> 02:36:14.744
MICA: To pick everybody up and put them--

3796
02:36:14.744 --> 02:36:17.349
LAURA: If you cast it, we'll lose Invisibility.

3797
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:20.254
SAM: Not if she casts it first, then you can--

3798
02:36:21.129 --> 02:36:25.721
LAURA: That's why I did
Pass Without a Trace first! What what?

3799
02:36:25.721 --> 02:36:29.106
MICA: I'll only be a giant owl for a moment.

3800
02:36:29.106 --> 02:36:31.497
MARISHA: I appreciate this druid logic.

3801
02:36:31.497 --> 02:36:34.460
MATT: So you are attempting to turn into a giant owl

3802
02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:37.070
in the middle of this main thoroughfare,

3803
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:38.767
and then you turn invisible.

3804
02:36:38.767 --> 02:36:40.948
It can be done, it's got to be quick.

3805
02:36:40.948 --> 02:36:43.105
It's like a (poofs).

3806
02:36:43.105 --> 02:36:43.938
So--
MICA: Yeah.

3807
02:36:43.938 --> 02:36:44.771
MATT: All right.

3808
02:36:44.771 --> 02:36:46.530
LIAM: No, no, <i>nein, nein.</i>

3809
02:36:46.530 --> 02:36:49.629
MICA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, what if, great DM,

3810
02:36:49.629 --> 02:36:54.007
is there is a back alley, shady or otherwise, about?

3811
02:36:54.007 --> 02:36:56.715
MATT: I would say you can Wild Shape while invisible.

3812
02:36:56.715 --> 02:36:59.431
Because Wild Shape isn't an attack or casting a spell.

3813
02:36:59.431 --> 02:37:00.841
TALIESIN: Oh, that's true.

3814
02:37:00.841 --> 02:37:02.648
TRAVIS: Druidic ability.

3815
02:37:02.648 --> 02:37:05.527
LIAM: Thank you, strange disembodied voice.

3816
02:37:05.527 --> 02:37:07.743
MATT: That is what I'm here for.

3817
02:37:07.743 --> 02:37:09.731
MATT: I heard a strange disembodied voice

3818
02:37:09.731 --> 02:37:12.617
that it's okay if I turn into an owl while invisible.

3819
02:37:12.617 --> 02:37:13.765
TRAVIS: Lots of angels out here.

3820
02:37:13.765 --> 02:37:15.266
MATT: You're welcome, book boy.

3821
02:37:15.266 --> 02:37:17.516
(laughter)

3822
02:37:18.843 --> 02:37:20.335
LIAM: One, two, three, four.

3823
02:37:20.335 --> 02:37:21.779
Poof, poof, poof, poof.

3824
02:37:21.779 --> 02:37:22.713
TRAVIS: Cool.

3825
02:37:22.713 --> 02:37:24.362
LIAM: Concentrating.

3826
02:37:24.362 --> 02:37:26.124
MATT: So the four of you are invisible.

3827
02:37:26.124 --> 02:37:26.957
Nott?

3828
02:37:26.957 --> 02:37:28.586
SAM: I will also cast the Invisibility on myself.

3829
02:37:28.586 --> 02:37:29.419
MARISHA: Question.

3830
02:37:29.419 --> 02:37:31.011
MATT: Five members of the party have vanished.

3831
02:37:31.011 --> 02:37:33.801
MARISHA: When you're invisible, can you see other people

3832
02:37:33.801 --> 02:37:35.963
made invisible by the same Invisibility spell?

3833
02:37:35.963 --> 02:37:37.636
MATT: Nope.
LAURA: We're all just invisible.

3834
02:37:37.636 --> 02:37:38.966
SAM: We're touching each other.

3835
02:37:38.966 --> 02:37:40.551
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Hands on butts.

3836
02:37:40.551 --> 02:37:42.322
LIAM: Careful.

3837
02:37:42.322 --> 02:37:45.171
Careful, Marisha, careful.

3838
02:37:45.171 --> 02:37:46.339
TRAVIS: You know what she likes.

3839
02:37:46.339 --> 02:37:47.455
MATT: There are some--

3840
02:37:47.455 --> 02:37:52.455
(laughter)

3841
02:37:53.447 --> 02:37:55.730
So.
LIAM: Punch yourself.

3842
02:37:56.858 --> 02:38:00.375
MATT: So all right, so who's grabbing onto who?

3843
02:38:00.375 --> 02:38:02.478
SAM: I got Jessie.
LAURA: I've got Nott.

3844
02:38:02.478 --> 02:38:03.685
MARISHA: I've got Reani.

3845
02:38:03.685 --> 02:38:04.878
MICA: I've got Beau.

3846
02:38:04.878 --> 02:38:06.027
TALIESIN: I've also got Reani.
MICA: And I've got Pinky.

3847
02:38:06.027 --> 02:38:08.412
TALIESIN: I'm giant.
LIAM: Who followed any of that, come on.

3848
02:38:08.412 --> 02:38:12.245
Side note, earlier today when he first got up,

3849
02:38:13.557 --> 02:38:16.039
Caleb I would say the night before

3850
02:38:16.039 --> 02:38:19.031
would've used transmuter stone is back to

3851
02:38:19.031 --> 02:38:21.990
advantage on constitution.

3852
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:23.066
SAM: Concentration?

3853
02:38:23.066 --> 02:38:25.839
LIAM: Proficient in--
TRAVIS: Con saves?

3854
02:38:25.839 --> 02:38:27.100
LIAM: Con saves, yeah.

3855
02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:28.312
MATT: Okay.

3856
02:38:29.162 --> 02:38:30.539
All right.

3857
02:38:30.539 --> 02:38:31.609
LIAM: (babbling)

3858
02:38:31.609 --> 02:38:34.483
MATT: With that, you are invisible.

3859
02:38:34.483 --> 02:38:36.876
You become your owl form?

3860
02:38:36.876 --> 02:38:38.293
Who do you grasp?

3861
02:38:39.407 --> 02:38:41.868
Caduceus and Beauregard, whom you are holding.

3862
02:38:41.868 --> 02:38:42.735
MICA: Yes.

3863
02:38:42.735 --> 02:38:45.745
MATT: You guys feel the shift of form.

3864
02:38:45.745 --> 02:38:47.455
Is that you cuddling up with the owl?

3865
02:38:47.455 --> 02:38:48.807
MARISHA: That's me getting prepped.

3866
02:38:48.807 --> 02:38:49.640
MATT: All right.

3867
02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:52.185
MICA: I, as gently as possible, pat around

3868
02:38:52.185 --> 02:38:55.465
to see if I can feel body with my talon, and try and--

3869
02:38:55.465 --> 02:38:58.184
MATT: You cop an accidental feel.

3870
02:38:58.184 --> 02:39:00.954
MICA: Cop an accidental feel.

3871
02:39:00.954 --> 02:39:03.093
Gently scoop both of them up.

3872
02:39:03.093 --> 02:39:04.093
All right.

3873
02:39:05.905 --> 02:39:10.661
MICA: Then, I'm pecking around with my beak

3874
02:39:10.661 --> 02:39:13.818
to see if I can find Jester, but like really gently

3875
02:39:13.818 --> 02:39:15.783
so I can pick her up.

3876
02:39:15.783 --> 02:39:16.963
Or are you getting up by yourself?

3877
02:39:16.963 --> 02:39:17.921
LAURA: I can do it.

3878
02:39:17.921 --> 02:39:19.420
MICA: Oh, just kidding, then I'm only going to take

3879
02:39:19.420 --> 02:39:20.253
the two of them.

3880
02:39:20.253 --> 02:39:22.269
MATT: All right, so with that, there's a gust of wind,

3881
02:39:22.269 --> 02:39:26.717
(whooshing) coming and flowing and lessening

3882
02:39:26.717 --> 02:39:30.094
as you assume the owl has taken off towards its destination.

3883
02:39:30.094 --> 02:39:31.492
LAURA: Were we all just supposed to go?

3884
02:39:31.492 --> 02:39:33.526
Like what were we, how are we getting up there?

3885
02:39:33.526 --> 02:39:34.515
SAM: On three.

3886
02:39:34.515 --> 02:39:36.163
(laughter)

3887
02:39:36.163 --> 02:39:37.620
LAURA: Are you leading the way? I'm just--

3888
02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:38.943
SAM: Go.
LAURA: Ah!

3889
02:39:38.943 --> 02:39:41.126
(laughter)

3890
02:39:42.475 --> 02:39:47.475
MATT: So you both just start running towards the residence.

3891
02:39:47.789 --> 02:39:50.099
All right, you do get a view.

3892
02:39:50.099 --> 02:39:51.779
There are three guards on the exterior.

3893
02:39:51.779 --> 02:39:53.029
There are two in the main courtyard

3894
02:39:53.029 --> 02:39:56.015
and there is one up on the third-level balcony.

3895
02:39:56.015 --> 02:39:57.691
MICA: Oh.
LIAM: Third-level balcony.

3896
02:39:57.691 --> 02:39:58.724
MATT: Correct.

3897
02:39:58.724 --> 02:40:01.613
The two outside have crossbows slung over their shoulders,

3898
02:40:01.613 --> 02:40:04.005
and have weapons drawn. The other one weapon's sheathed,

3899
02:40:04.005 --> 02:40:05.459
just walking and keeping an eye out.

3900
02:40:05.459 --> 02:40:07.375
The one on the balcony is actually sitting in a chair

3901
02:40:07.375 --> 02:40:09.665
with a heavy crossbow across the lap,

3902
02:40:09.665 --> 02:40:11.897
but looks to be like zoning out a little,

3903
02:40:11.897 --> 02:40:16.897
not quite like sleepy, but definitely this is a routine.

3904
02:40:17.527 --> 02:40:20.476
LIAM: Down on the street.
MATT: Yes.

3905
02:40:20.476 --> 02:40:22.054
LIAM: Caleb and Fjord stand next to each other

3906
02:40:22.054 --> 02:40:24.280
and just after a beat, after they vanish,

3907
02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:28.346
Caleb, staring, says: Last time we did this,

3908
02:40:28.346 --> 02:40:31.611
you held a sword to my neck.

3909
02:40:31.611 --> 02:40:32.664
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

3910
02:40:32.664 --> 02:40:34.486
LIAM: Good times.

3911
02:40:34.486 --> 02:40:36.343
TRAVIS: Sorry about that.

3912
02:40:36.343 --> 02:40:37.769
LIAM: Eh.

3913
02:40:37.769 --> 02:40:40.711
TRAVIS: Control issues and such.

3914
02:40:40.711 --> 02:40:43.154
LIAM: I wouldn't know about that.

3915
02:40:43.154 --> 02:40:46.267
(snickering)

3916
02:40:46.267 --> 02:40:47.100
MATT: Okay.

3917
02:40:48.917 --> 02:40:51.634
I'd like you all to roll stealth checks with advantage,

3918
02:40:51.634 --> 02:40:55.541
because you are invisible, and you have plus 10

3919
02:40:55.541 --> 02:40:57.449
because you cast Pass Without a Trace, right?

3920
02:40:57.449 --> 02:40:59.703
So you are super fucking stealthy right now.

3921
02:40:59.703 --> 02:41:02.470
LAURA: Oh god, god, thank god.

3922
02:41:02.470 --> 02:41:04.792
LIAM: You're the Nazgul. (whispers)

3923
02:41:04.792 --> 02:41:06.017
SAM: 30.

3924
02:41:06.017 --> 02:41:07.419
TALIESIN: With advantage?
MATT: You both have it.

3925
02:41:07.419 --> 02:41:09.333
You guys have advantage, you do not get the plus 10

3926
02:41:09.333 --> 02:41:11.009
because you guys are your own separate troupe.

3927
02:41:11.009 --> 02:41:11.975
LAURA: Yeah.
MICA: Wait, what?

3928
02:41:11.975 --> 02:41:13.137
MATT: Unless you cast--

3929
02:41:13.137 --> 02:41:15.568
LAURA: You flew further than 30 feet away from me.

3930
02:41:15.568 --> 02:41:17.276
MICA: Oh, okay.

3931
02:41:17.276 --> 02:41:19.710
SAM: I rolled a one and a seven.

3932
02:41:19.710 --> 02:41:21.323
LAURA: Oh my god, I rolled a one as well.

3933
02:41:21.323 --> 02:41:22.737
TALIESIN: Oh god, that's terrible.

3934
02:41:22.737 --> 02:41:24.659
MICA: I got a 10 total.

3935
02:41:24.659 --> 02:41:27.809
MATT: Total of 10? What'd you roll?

3936
02:41:27.809 --> 02:41:29.284
MICA: I rolled a seven.

3937
02:41:29.284 --> 02:41:30.145
MATT: With advantage?

3938
02:41:30.145 --> 02:41:31.103
MICA: Yeah.

3939
02:41:31.103 --> 02:41:33.581
MATT: Well, the owl's is plus eight, remember?

3940
02:41:33.581 --> 02:41:35.537
MICA: Oh shit, I'm an owl.

3941
02:41:35.537 --> 02:41:37.348
MATT: The giant owl has a plus eight to stealth.

3942
02:41:37.348 --> 02:41:38.314
MICA: Thank god.

3943
02:41:38.314 --> 02:41:40.059
SAM: How do you know that?

3944
02:41:40.059 --> 02:41:41.916
MATT: Because I remember from last time we played.

3945
02:41:41.916 --> 02:41:45.853
MICA: Oh yeah, you're right, okay, so seven plus eight.

3946
02:41:45.853 --> 02:41:46.925
LAURA: 15.
MICA: That one.

3947
02:41:46.925 --> 02:41:48.535
MATT: Okay.

3948
02:41:48.535 --> 02:41:50.165
MICA: Thank you, owl.

3949
02:41:50.165 --> 02:41:51.264
TALIESIN: Five.

3950
02:41:51.264 --> 02:41:52.270
(groaning)

3951
02:41:52.270 --> 02:41:53.170
MATT: With advantage?

3952
02:41:53.170 --> 02:41:55.836
TALIESIN: I rolled two fours.
MATT: Oh, buddy.

3953
02:41:55.836 --> 02:41:56.678
All right.

3954
02:41:56.678 --> 02:41:58.375
TALIESIN: I thought we had Pass Without a Trace.

3955
02:41:58.375 --> 02:41:59.607
LAURA: You flew away from me.

3956
02:41:59.607 --> 02:42:00.819
TALIESIN: You were going to come, oh.
MATT: Beauregard?

3957
02:42:00.819 --> 02:42:02.998
MARISHA: 24.
MATT: 24, okay.

3958
02:42:02.998 --> 02:42:03.831
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

3959
02:42:03.831 --> 02:42:05.648
LIAM: But an owl the size of a Barca lounger

3960
02:42:05.648 --> 02:42:07.715
has a plus eight to stealth?

3961
02:42:07.715 --> 02:42:08.778
TALIESIN: They're quiet.

3962
02:42:08.778 --> 02:42:11.729
MATT: So you guys fly up. Where are you heading towards,

3963
02:42:11.729 --> 02:42:12.870
is this the roof?

3964
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:14.064
MICA: Towards the roof where the hatch is.

3965
02:42:14.064 --> 02:42:14.897
MATT: Okay.

3966
02:42:14.897 --> 02:42:17.090
You head towards the roof, and you watch

3967
02:42:17.090 --> 02:42:22.007
as the one guard is fazing out a little bit, goes,

3968
02:42:24.311 --> 02:42:25.780
and is just on alert.

3969
02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:26.923
SAM: Oh no.

3970
02:42:26.923 --> 02:42:27.878
MATT: Hears something.

3971
02:42:27.878 --> 02:42:31.407
Doesn't quite know direction, doesn't see anything,

3972
02:42:31.407 --> 02:42:35.415
of course, but does seem to be going from a passive,

3973
02:42:35.415 --> 02:42:37.326
it's an every day scenario, to being at least

3974
02:42:37.326 --> 02:42:38.661
on some level of alert.

3975
02:42:38.661 --> 02:42:40.164
TRAVIS: His icon turned yellow.

3976
02:42:40.164 --> 02:42:43.845
MATT: Yeah, this is a, little exclamation point, bling!

3977
02:42:43.845 --> 02:42:44.940
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter)

3978
02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:46.612
MICA: Little eye shows up like in Skyrim.

3979
02:42:46.612 --> 02:42:48.336
You're not quite hidden, but you're not quite seen.

3980
02:42:48.336 --> 02:42:50.262
LAURA: You got to get hidden so he goes back to--

3981
02:42:50.262 --> 02:42:51.846
MATT: Exactly.

3982
02:42:51.846 --> 02:42:53.930
So you guys make it up. You're landing on the roof.

3983
02:42:53.930 --> 02:42:56.471
The space there is about a 10, 15-foot gap.

3984
02:42:56.471 --> 02:42:57.659
It's a little bit of a squeeze; you're going to

3985
02:42:57.659 --> 02:42:59.825
have to like glide in and then stop.

3986
02:42:59.825 --> 02:43:00.658
MICA: Okay.

3987
02:43:00.658 --> 02:43:01.981
MATT: And you're holding them?

3988
02:43:01.981 --> 02:43:03.130
MICA: Yeah.

3989
02:43:03.130 --> 02:43:04.971
MATT: All right, what are you going to do?

3990
02:43:04.971 --> 02:43:08.178
To land, you got to let them go, and you got to glide in.

3991
02:43:08.178 --> 02:43:09.739
What are you doing? It's coming quick.

3992
02:43:09.739 --> 02:43:12.429
MICA: It's coming quick, I'm going to get as close as I can,

3993
02:43:12.429 --> 02:43:14.712
and try and gently drop them, but make sure they have

3994
02:43:14.712 --> 02:43:17.155
enough space to like, you know how owls

3995
02:43:17.155 --> 02:43:20.109
pull back and like stop?

3996
02:43:20.109 --> 02:43:20.972
MATT: Okay.

3997
02:43:20.972 --> 02:43:22.788
MICA: So drop them with knowing that I have enough space

3998
02:43:22.788 --> 02:43:25.945
to like, brake, emergency brake.

3999
02:43:25.945 --> 02:43:27.329
MATT: All right, all right.

4000
02:43:27.329 --> 02:43:29.101
I'll say roll a dexterity check for me,

4001
02:43:29.101 --> 02:43:30.656
using the owl's physicality.

4002
02:43:30.656 --> 02:43:32.427
MICA: Using the owl's dex.

4003
02:43:32.427 --> 02:43:34.192
LIAM: How far back is the street team
from the front of the--

4004
02:43:34.192 --> 02:43:35.744
MICA: Hmm.

4005
02:43:35.744 --> 02:43:37.161
MATT: About 150 feet.

4006
02:43:38.780 --> 02:43:39.646
MICA: Seven.

4007
02:43:39.646 --> 02:43:40.575
MATT: Seven.
TRAVIS: Fuck.

4008
02:43:40.575 --> 02:43:42.173
MATT: So--
MICA: You're banished.

4009
02:43:42.173 --> 02:43:44.574
MATT: I need both Caduceus and Beauregard

4010
02:43:44.574 --> 02:43:46.924
to roll acrobatics checks, as you are both suddenly

4011
02:43:46.924 --> 02:43:51.715
flung from the owl at the top speed of 60 feet per round,

4012
02:43:51.715 --> 02:43:53.449
I think it was?

4013
02:43:53.449 --> 02:43:54.737
MARISHA: Natural 20.

4014
02:43:54.737 --> 02:43:55.570
LIAM: Yeah.

4015
02:43:55.570 --> 02:43:59.416
MATT: You three-point land like anime landing,

4016
02:43:59.416 --> 02:44:03.052
like skid across, without, just a rock.

4017
02:44:03.052 --> 02:44:04.433
Caduceus?
TALIESIN: 12.

4018
02:44:04.433 --> 02:44:08.933
MATT: 12, Caduceus (impacting) tumble a bit.

4019
02:44:08.933 --> 02:44:12.990
You hear the guard go, "What's that?

4020
02:44:12.990 --> 02:44:14.306
"Hold on."

4021
02:44:15.818 --> 02:44:17.910
LAURA: Do the other two guards seem to notice

4022
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:20.231
what that third guard is doing?

4023
02:44:20.231 --> 02:44:21.736
Or is it just--

4024
02:44:21.736 --> 02:44:22.832
MATT: They do not!

4025
02:44:22.832 --> 02:44:23.790
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: They're just

4026
02:44:23.790 --> 02:44:25.075
going about their business.
LAURA: So the top one is the only one

4027
02:44:25.075 --> 02:44:26.154
seeing shit.

4028
02:44:26.154 --> 02:44:29.194
What are the two guards on the ground doing right now?

4029
02:44:29.194 --> 02:44:31.937
MATT: One of them is just at the front door keeping watch,

4030
02:44:31.937 --> 02:44:33.509
the other is doing like a perimeter patrol

4031
02:44:33.509 --> 02:44:34.644
of the outside gates.

4032
02:44:34.644 --> 02:44:35.932
LAURA: Okay, then--

4033
02:44:35.932 --> 02:44:39.481
SAM: We'll wait till he or she walks away.

4034
02:44:39.481 --> 02:44:41.001
LAURA: I'm going to get to the side of the house.

4035
02:44:41.001 --> 02:44:43.472
SAM: Is there a gate or a fence to climb over?

4036
02:44:43.472 --> 02:44:47.235
MATT: There is, there is an iron fence with wooden pillar,

4037
02:44:47.235 --> 02:44:49.717
or sorry, stone pillars that are about eight foot tall,

4038
02:44:49.717 --> 02:44:51.573
the gate's about seven feet tall,

4039
02:44:51.573 --> 02:44:54.632
and about every 10 or 15 feet or so

4040
02:44:54.632 --> 02:44:59.157
are these stone pillars between each segment of iron gate.

4041
02:44:59.157 --> 02:45:00.240
SAM: Climb over?

4042
02:45:01.989 --> 02:45:03.749
LAURA: Sure, stealthily.

4043
02:45:03.749 --> 02:45:05.698
Well, here's the thing.
MATT: Okay.

4044
02:45:05.698 --> 02:45:08.768
LAURA: Is there anywhere along the fence, like,

4045
02:45:08.768 --> 02:45:11.910
that in a split second it looks like

4046
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:14.613
neither of the two guards are looking can see us?

4047
02:45:14.613 --> 02:45:17.021
SAM: Is it a barred fence or is it a solid stone fence?

4048
02:45:17.021 --> 02:45:19.962
MATT: No, it's iron bars about maybe that far apart.

4049
02:45:19.962 --> 02:45:20.994
SAM: And there's pillars.

4050
02:45:20.994 --> 02:45:23.658
MATT: And there are stone pillars every 10 or 15 feet

4051
02:45:23.658 --> 02:45:25.952
that these fences go to, yeah.

4052
02:45:25.952 --> 02:45:27.107
SAM: We've got invisibility.

4053
02:45:27.107 --> 02:45:28.307
LAURA: Just do it?
SAM: Yep.

4054
02:45:28.307 --> 02:45:29.638
MICA: Oh my god.

4055
02:45:29.638 --> 02:45:31.626
LAURA: This is really bad, though.
SAM: It's going to be fine.

4056
02:45:31.626 --> 02:45:33.198
MATT: Whatcha doing?

4057
02:45:33.198 --> 02:45:37.664
LAURA: Going to get behind the pillar, right here,

4058
02:45:37.664 --> 02:45:41.880
and I'm going to Dimension Door us

4059
02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:44.641
right behind the guard on the third level.

4060
02:45:44.641 --> 02:45:46.310
MATT: The one who's on the balcony? Okay.

4061
02:45:46.310 --> 02:45:48.501
LAURA: Right behind him.
SAM: I'm going to prepare my weapon.

4062
02:45:48.501 --> 02:45:51.379
LAURA: I'm going to get ready to drop down to the ground

4063
02:45:51.379 --> 02:45:52.960
and yank him down as soon as we do.

4064
02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:54.876
MATT: Okay, so.
MARISHA: Dope.

4065
02:45:54.876 --> 02:45:56.595
MATT: You guys hear, as you're getting ready,

4066
02:45:56.595 --> 02:45:58.986
you hear the (impacting) on the roof

4067
02:45:58.986 --> 02:46:01.226
and the guard reacting, and you're like, "Oh shit,"

4068
02:46:01.226 --> 02:46:02.228
that's when you get behind the pillar.

4069
02:46:02.228 --> 02:46:03.061
SAM: On three.

4070
02:46:03.061 --> 02:46:05.061
MATT: You wait for the guards to not be looking.

4071
02:46:05.061 --> 02:46:06.529
Roll a perception check, Jester.

4072
02:46:06.529 --> 02:46:08.137
LAURA: Oh dear.

4073
02:46:11.486 --> 02:46:12.942
Okay.

4074
02:46:12.942 --> 02:46:13.775
18.

4075
02:46:13.775 --> 02:46:16.281
MATT: With a quick glance, which is all you need,

4076
02:46:16.281 --> 02:46:18.061
you find the right moment where the guards

4077
02:46:18.061 --> 02:46:19.962
are looking in opposite directions of where you both are.

4078
02:46:19.962 --> 02:46:22.877
You pull in, cast the spell, and (whooshes),

4079
02:46:22.877 --> 02:46:25.729
with that, you are immediately leapt in a split second

4080
02:46:25.729 --> 02:46:30.031
to the exterior of the home on that balcony,

4081
02:46:30.031 --> 02:46:32.214
both landing, and the guard there is like,

4082
02:46:32.214 --> 02:46:33.899
just finished cocking the heavy crossbow back

4083
02:46:33.899 --> 02:46:36.484
and is looking up at the roof and is about to like,

4084
02:46:36.484 --> 02:46:38.171
head back in towards the glass door.

4085
02:46:38.171 --> 02:46:39.296
What are you doing?
LIAM: Fuck him up.

4086
02:46:39.296 --> 02:46:42.318
LAURA: I yank him, and pull him back right as Nott--

4087
02:46:42.318 --> 02:46:45.818
SAM: I'm going to shoot him in his throat.

4088
02:46:46.708 --> 02:46:48.015
MARISHA: Yes!

4089
02:46:48.015 --> 02:46:49.342
MATT: Okay!

4090
02:46:49.342 --> 02:46:52.568
Go ahead and roll an attack, Jester.

4091
02:46:52.568 --> 02:46:53.446
LAURA: Okay.

4092
02:46:53.446 --> 02:46:54.287
TALIESIN: That got dark.

4093
02:46:54.287 --> 02:46:56.222
MATT: Well actually this, that's cocked.

4094
02:46:56.222 --> 02:46:57.696
This wouldn't be an attack, this would be

4095
02:46:57.696 --> 02:46:59.115
a grapple attempt for you.

4096
02:46:59.115 --> 02:47:03.538
So this is a strength, or an athletics check is what it is.

4097
02:47:03.538 --> 02:47:05.946
SAM: Jesus.
LAURA: Ooh.

4098
02:47:05.946 --> 02:47:07.093
Athletics?

4099
02:47:07.093 --> 02:47:08.391
MATT: Yes.

4100
02:47:08.391 --> 02:47:09.345
LAURA: 19.

4101
02:47:09.345 --> 02:47:10.775
MATT: That's a fail.

4102
02:47:10.775 --> 02:47:12.961
As soon as you land, the guard goes, "Wha--?!"

4103
02:47:12.961 --> 02:47:14.919
and you just grab and pull him onto the ground.

4104
02:47:14.919 --> 02:47:17.042
He's like (grunts) and is trying to make noise.

4105
02:47:17.042 --> 02:47:18.865
SAM: I'm shooting him in the neck.

4106
02:47:18.865 --> 02:47:20.405
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack.

4107
02:47:20.405 --> 02:47:22.210
SAM: It's a sneak attack, I assume?

4108
02:47:22.210 --> 02:47:24.224
MATT: Currently threatened by your ally,

4109
02:47:24.224 --> 02:47:27.090
yes, it is sneak attack and surprised, so.

4110
02:47:27.090 --> 02:47:28.475
Which means you get advantage on the attack
SAM: Natural 20.

4111
02:47:28.475 --> 02:47:30.117
(groaning)

4112
02:47:30.117 --> 02:47:32.608
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

4113
02:47:32.608 --> 02:47:34.531
LIAM: That reaction's getting giffed.

4114
02:47:34.531 --> 02:47:35.848
(laughter)

4115
02:47:35.848 --> 02:47:36.956
MARISHA: Yes.

4116
02:47:36.956 --> 02:47:39.570
TRAVIS: This dude--
SAM: Oh boy.

4117
02:47:39.570 --> 02:47:41.424
TRAVIS: -- was falling asleep.

4118
02:47:41.424 --> 02:47:44.727
MICA: Minding his own fucking business.

4119
02:47:44.727 --> 02:47:46.252
LIAM: I was like, "I'll cast Sleep on him,

4120
02:47:46.252 --> 02:47:47.452
"he'll just take a nap."

4121
02:47:47.452 --> 02:47:48.600
Nope, dead.

4122
02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:49.592
MATT: Yep.

4123
02:47:49.592 --> 02:47:50.672
Well we'll see, we'll see.

4124
02:47:50.672 --> 02:47:51.992
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4125
02:47:51.992 --> 02:47:53.483
MICA: He's at least going to bleed the fuck out.

4126
02:47:53.483 --> 02:47:56.065
SAM: First shot, because it's a crit, you double the dice?

4127
02:47:56.065 --> 02:47:57.142
MATT: Correct.

4128
02:47:57.142 --> 02:47:58.165
SAM: 60.

4129
02:47:58.165 --> 02:47:59.971
(gasping)

4130
02:47:59.971 --> 02:48:03.684
But it automatically shoots again.

4131
02:48:03.684 --> 02:48:06.437
MATT: Well, fire again, fire again.

4132
02:48:06.437 --> 02:48:07.928
SAM: That's a 22 to hit.

4133
02:48:07.928 --> 02:48:08.816
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

4134
02:48:08.816 --> 02:48:09.816
LAURA: Oh my god.

4135
02:48:11.689 --> 02:48:12.916
SAM: Nine more points of damage.

4136
02:48:12.916 --> 02:48:14.251
MATT: (gagging)

4137
02:48:14.251 --> 02:48:15.231
(coughs)

4138
02:48:15.231 --> 02:48:16.186
(laughter)

4139
02:48:16.186 --> 02:48:18.722
As another arrow goes into the throat.

4140
02:48:18.722 --> 02:48:21.110
Fucking dead instantly.

4141
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:22.171
SAM: I'm sorry.

4142
02:48:22.171 --> 02:48:23.214
LAURA: Nott.
SAM: I'm sorry.

4143
02:48:23.214 --> 02:48:24.919
LAURA: You killed him.
SAM: His head fell off.

4144
02:48:24.919 --> 02:48:26.613
(laughter)

4145
02:48:26.613 --> 02:48:27.446
I'm sorry.

4146
02:48:27.446 --> 02:48:29.526
LAURA: I thought he should go to sleep.

4147
02:48:29.526 --> 02:48:32.466
Oh my god, oh my god.

4148
02:48:32.466 --> 02:48:34.024
TALIESIN: This is--

4149
02:48:34.024 --> 02:48:37.771
LAURA: I'm going to pull the things out of his throat

4150
02:48:37.771 --> 02:48:41.260
and like tie a little bit of sash around his neck

4151
02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:42.980
so you can't see the blood.

4152
02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:45.432
(laughter)

4153
02:48:45.432 --> 02:48:46.265
MATT: Okay.

4154
02:48:46.265 --> 02:48:47.688
(laughter)

4155
02:48:47.688 --> 02:48:52.477
LAURA: Then I'm just going to make it look like

4156
02:48:52.477 --> 02:48:53.642
he's not bleeding.

4157
02:48:53.642 --> 02:48:56.409
I'm going to Cure Wounds, because he's dead already.

4158
02:48:56.409 --> 02:48:57.831
MATT: Cure Wounds doesn't get rid of blood.

4159
02:48:57.831 --> 02:48:59.877
SAM: Just paint over it.

4160
02:48:59.877 --> 02:49:02.346
LAURA: I'm going to paint over it.

4161
02:49:02.346 --> 02:49:04.274
MATT: Okay, okay.
SAM: Just wrap it.

4162
02:49:04.274 --> 02:49:06.653
LAURA: Just make it to where you can't see the blood.

4163
02:49:06.653 --> 02:49:08.047
MATT: There's a lot of blood, you just fucking

4164
02:49:08.047 --> 02:49:10.254
shot him in the throat and killed him in one hit.

4165
02:49:10.254 --> 02:49:13.356
We're talking, like, like it's-- yeah.

4166
02:49:13.356 --> 02:49:14.941
LIAM: It's the Red Wedding.

4167
02:49:14.941 --> 02:49:16.777
LAURA: But is he wearing like armor?

4168
02:49:16.777 --> 02:49:19.594
MATT: Yeah, he's wearing like a simple breastplate,

4169
02:49:19.594 --> 02:49:21.576
some simple pauldrons.

4170
02:49:21.576 --> 02:49:23.848
TALIESIN: And a pool of blood, he's wearing a pool of blood.

4171
02:49:23.848 --> 02:49:25.894
MATT: He's wearing a pool of blood.

4172
02:49:25.894 --> 02:49:27.033
A red apron.

4173
02:49:27.033 --> 02:49:29.614
SAM: I'm going to take his hands and his large crossbow

4174
02:49:29.614 --> 02:49:33.285
and point it backwards, like he couldn't take it anymore.

4175
02:49:33.285 --> 02:49:35.983
LAURA: No, Nott, don't, no, because he's got to look like

4176
02:49:35.983 --> 02:49:38.164
he's still here, he's got to look--

4177
02:49:38.164 --> 02:49:39.229
TALIESIN: How is this happening!

4178
02:49:39.229 --> 02:49:40.731
LAURA: He just needs to look like he's still sitting.

4179
02:49:40.731 --> 02:49:42.648
SAM: You want no one to notice this?

4180
02:49:42.648 --> 02:49:44.518
He is dead.

4181
02:49:44.518 --> 02:49:47.521
LAURA: Yeah, but we can Weekend at Bernie's him and just--

4182
02:49:47.521 --> 02:49:48.449
TRAVIS: No!

4183
02:49:49.397 --> 02:49:50.348
No!

4184
02:49:50.348 --> 02:49:51.503
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

4185
02:49:51.503 --> 02:49:54.560
We can flip him over like he's sleeping,

4186
02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:57.604
we can put him in like a sleeping position.

4187
02:49:57.604 --> 02:49:59.979
LAURA: No, he's got to just, (sighs).

4188
02:49:59.979 --> 02:50:03.397
SAM: I mean he's dead, we can't make him look alive.

4189
02:50:03.397 --> 02:50:06.814
LIAM: We are going PvP with Reani any second.

4190
02:50:08.425 --> 02:50:10.203
LAURA: She doesn't see this is happening.

4191
02:50:10.203 --> 02:50:11.605
MATT: That's true.

4192
02:50:11.605 --> 02:50:13.353
TRAVIS: Do something, do something, do something.

4193
02:50:13.353 --> 02:50:16.039
MATT: What are you doing, guys, what are you doing?

4194
02:50:16.039 --> 02:50:18.536
LAURA: I'm going to pull him away from the balcony

4195
02:50:18.536 --> 02:50:19.672
to where he's like--

4196
02:50:19.672 --> 02:50:21.855
MATT: Towards the windows and the glass door?

4197
02:50:21.855 --> 02:50:24.939
LAURA: So nobody can see.
SAM: The windows and glass door.

4198
02:50:24.939 --> 02:50:26.867
TRAVIS: Like a kid's room, they're like--

4199
02:50:26.867 --> 02:50:28.678
(laughter)

4200
02:50:28.678 --> 02:50:31.574
LAURA: If I look up, can anybody see onto the balcony?

4201
02:50:31.574 --> 02:50:33.317
Can you see it from like a high vantage?

4202
02:50:33.317 --> 02:50:35.300
MATT: No, not on the third level of this perspective

4203
02:50:35.300 --> 02:50:36.387
and pulling away, no.

4204
02:50:36.387 --> 02:50:39.345
LAURA: Okay, then from here I'm going to--

4205
02:50:39.345 --> 02:50:40.883
TALIESIN: Bury your shame.

4206
02:50:40.883 --> 02:50:41.990
LAURA: Yeah.

4207
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:43.699
I mean, how do we get up to the--

4208
02:50:43.699 --> 02:50:44.647
SAM: We climb.

4209
02:50:44.647 --> 02:50:46.467
LAURA: Can we climb up to the roof from here?

4210
02:50:46.467 --> 02:50:47.527
LIAM: It's awful slippery now.

4211
02:50:47.527 --> 02:50:50.333
MATT: You can, so you're just going to leave the body there,

4212
02:50:50.333 --> 02:50:51.908
by the side, and you're going to attempt to climb,

4213
02:50:51.908 --> 02:50:53.953
I need you both to make athletics checks, please.

4214
02:50:53.953 --> 02:50:55.278
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4215
02:50:55.278 --> 02:50:57.417
MICA: I think I just got abs from laughing so hard.

4216
02:50:57.417 --> 02:50:59.648
TALIESIN: I love that it's always the person who is so

4217
02:50:59.648 --> 02:51:02.380
adamant that we make a complex plan that is the one

4218
02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:04.636
to immediately throw everything out the window.

4219
02:51:04.636 --> 02:51:05.469
TRAVIS: Murder.

4220
02:51:05.469 --> 02:51:06.966
MATT: You both are trying to find any sort of

4221
02:51:06.966 --> 02:51:08.428
hand or foothold from the balcony,

4222
02:51:08.428 --> 02:51:10.439
and there's no way up to the roof.

4223
02:51:10.439 --> 02:51:12.838
Like, you can see a couple of bits of the frame,

4224
02:51:12.838 --> 02:51:15.656
but you just don't have the strength and leverage

4225
02:51:15.656 --> 02:51:17.153
to actually get any sort of--

4226
02:51:17.153 --> 02:51:18.449
SAM: There's windows and doors here.

4227
02:51:18.449 --> 02:51:19.809
There's windows and doors on this level.

4228
02:51:19.809 --> 02:51:21.716
LAURA: Yeah, but they could be like trapped and stuff.

4229
02:51:21.716 --> 02:51:23.586
SAM: I can look for the traps.

4230
02:51:23.586 --> 02:51:25.530
What are you going to do, Dimension Door us?

4231
02:51:25.530 --> 02:51:27.114
LAURA: I was going to Dimension Door us to the roof.

4232
02:51:27.114 --> 02:51:28.956
SAM: That seems like an escape way, but yeah,

4233
02:51:28.956 --> 02:51:31.015
do what you do, do what you do.

4234
02:51:31.015 --> 02:51:31.990
LIAM: This is going to turn into that one

4235
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:33.631
Black Mirror episode.

4236
02:51:33.631 --> 02:51:35.742
TALIESIN: It's already there.
MARISHA: Which one?

4237
02:51:35.742 --> 02:51:36.575
LAURA: I'm going to Dimension Door us

4238
02:51:36.575 --> 02:51:38.341
to the roof with everybody else.

4239
02:51:38.341 --> 02:51:39.855
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Not inside?

4240
02:51:39.855 --> 02:51:41.939
LAURA: I thought you guys were already on--

4241
02:51:41.939 --> 02:51:44.209
MATT: After tumbling for a moment, and like--

4242
02:51:44.209 --> 02:51:45.404
LAURA: Should've gone inside.

4243
02:51:45.404 --> 02:51:49.371
MATT: Landed on the roof, you hear the owl come to land,

4244
02:51:49.371 --> 02:51:51.780
footfalls onto the roof space there.

4245
02:51:51.780 --> 02:51:54.005
A little bit of a tumble, but you're okay.

4246
02:51:56.195 --> 02:51:58.222
TALIESIN: I think we're okay.

4247
02:51:58.222 --> 02:52:00.118
MATT: All right, so you guys are still invisible.

4248
02:52:00.118 --> 02:52:01.649
MARISHA: We haven't seen them yet?

4249
02:52:01.649 --> 02:52:03.446
TRAVIS: So tell me it was too far for you to just

4250
02:52:03.446 --> 02:52:05.615
initially Dimension Door to the roof.

4251
02:52:05.615 --> 02:52:07.790
It was too far, right?

4252
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:09.056
LAURA: Definitely too far.

4253
02:52:09.056 --> 02:52:10.252
TRAVIS: You just killed us.

4254
02:52:10.252 --> 02:52:11.543
LAURA: We didn't-- I wasn't going to--

4255
02:52:11.543 --> 02:52:12.376
we weren't trying to kill him,

4256
02:52:12.376 --> 02:52:14.242
we were just trying to keep him quiet.

4257
02:52:14.242 --> 02:52:16.125
Because he heard you guys. He heard them!

4258
02:52:16.125 --> 02:52:17.385
MARISHA: There's no way.

4259
02:52:17.385 --> 02:52:18.916
(laughter)

4260
02:52:18.916 --> 02:52:20.794
MATT: What are you guys doing?

4261
02:52:20.794 --> 02:52:23.805
MICA: After hearing them tumble, I want to, as an owl,

4262
02:52:23.805 --> 02:52:26.285
gently search for them with my feathers

4263
02:52:26.285 --> 02:52:27.956
to just make sure that they're okay.

4264
02:52:27.956 --> 02:52:29.296
MATT: They're okay.

4265
02:52:29.296 --> 02:52:31.211
You eventually find them a moment later.

4266
02:52:31.211 --> 02:52:32.044
(poofs)

4267
02:52:32.044 --> 02:52:35.194
Jester and Nott appear next to you on the roof.

4268
02:52:35.194 --> 02:52:36.027
LAURA: Hi.

4269
02:52:36.027 --> 02:52:37.787
(laughter)

4270
02:52:39.275 --> 02:52:40.108
LAURA: Yeah.

4271
02:52:41.881 --> 02:52:43.597
SAM: This is just...

4272
02:52:44.539 --> 02:52:45.955
cherry sauce.

4273
02:52:47.218 --> 02:52:48.631
TALIESIN: I don't know what that means.

4274
02:52:48.631 --> 02:52:50.670
SAM: Let's pick the lock.

4275
02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:52.366
Where's the latch?

4276
02:52:52.366 --> 02:52:55.449
MARISHA: It's over here.
TALIESIN: Check for traps, too.

4277
02:52:55.449 --> 02:52:57.291
MATT: Caleb, what are you doing?

4278
02:52:57.291 --> 02:52:59.328
LIAM: I'm waiting to hear from my friend, Nott,

4279
02:52:59.328 --> 02:53:01.242
who was going to message me when it was time.

4280
02:53:01.242 --> 02:53:02.664
SAM: When it's time, when it's time.

4281
02:53:02.664 --> 02:53:04.311
I'm going to go see if it's locked.

4282
02:53:04.311 --> 02:53:05.411
MATT: Okay.

4283
02:53:05.411 --> 02:53:08.446
MICA: I'm going to un-owl at this point.

4284
02:53:08.446 --> 02:53:11.471
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

4285
02:53:11.471 --> 02:53:14.923
LIAM: I do say to Fjord, though, it feels like it's been

4286
02:53:14.923 --> 02:53:17.585
a little long since we've heard--

4287
02:53:17.585 --> 02:53:20.359
TRAVIS: I smell metallic in the air.

4288
02:53:20.359 --> 02:53:23.481
Metallic liquid.
LAURA: No, you don't.

4289
02:53:23.481 --> 02:53:26.419
LIAM: But it is stretching on in time here.

4290
02:53:26.419 --> 02:53:27.409
MATT: All right.

4291
02:53:27.409 --> 02:53:29.026
TRAVIS: The killing of innocent metallic.

4292
02:53:29.026 --> 02:53:29.867
MATT: Okay, so--

4293
02:53:29.867 --> 02:53:32.499
LAURA: That all happened very quickly.

4294
02:53:32.499 --> 02:53:35.690
MATT: The roof is indeed locked, the latch is locked.

4295
02:53:35.690 --> 02:53:37.512
SAM: I will try to pick the lock.

4296
02:53:37.512 --> 02:53:38.345
MATT: Go for it.

4297
02:53:38.345 --> 02:53:40.665
So dexterity plus proficiency modifier.

4298
02:53:40.665 --> 02:53:41.748
SAM: Ooh, rough.

4299
02:53:42.623 --> 02:53:44.226
Oh wait, thieves' tools, right?

4300
02:53:44.226 --> 02:53:45.640
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: 17.

4301
02:53:45.640 --> 02:53:46.473
MATT: 17?

4302
02:53:48.326 --> 02:53:49.860
It's not opening.

4303
02:53:49.860 --> 02:53:51.112
MARISHA: Can you Mage Hand it?

4304
02:53:51.112 --> 02:53:53.125
MATT: It's hard to latch on the inside.

4305
02:53:53.125 --> 02:53:56.299
The mechanism is partially in the interior,

4306
02:53:56.299 --> 02:53:58.855
so you're just unable to quite get it.

4307
02:53:58.855 --> 02:54:00.240
LAURA: I'm going to take my paints out.

4308
02:54:00.240 --> 02:54:02.346
I'm going to paint a hole.

4309
02:54:02.346 --> 02:54:03.946
MATT: Okay.

4310
02:54:03.946 --> 02:54:05.799
So you go ahead and paint a dark circle

4311
02:54:05.799 --> 02:54:07.845
and give a little bit of the dimension to it,

4312
02:54:07.845 --> 02:54:09.990
and Jester-- at first it looks, you know,

4313
02:54:09.990 --> 02:54:11.785
simple and rudimentary,

4314
02:54:11.785 --> 02:54:14.102
but the more paint she applies and darkens the ink,

4315
02:54:14.102 --> 02:54:16.796
eventually you're like, oh, that looks like a hole,

4316
02:54:16.796 --> 02:54:18.616
and then the section of the roof is just gone,

4317
02:54:18.616 --> 02:54:20.287
and there's just a hole in the roof.

4318
02:54:20.287 --> 02:54:22.219
SAM: Nice.
MATT: It's kind of incredible.

4319
02:54:22.219 --> 02:54:24.241
MICA: That's really cool.
LAURA: Thanks.

4320
02:54:24.241 --> 02:54:25.899
SAM: All right.

4321
02:54:25.899 --> 02:54:28.521
I will take out a piece of metal wire

4322
02:54:28.521 --> 02:54:30.198
and rub it around my lips.

4323
02:54:30.198 --> 02:54:31.511
I don't know.

4324
02:54:31.511 --> 02:54:34.240
Then going to message Caleb and say, okay,

4325
02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:39.240
Team Alpha is going into the roof hole, the roof hole.

4326
02:54:40.017 --> 02:54:41.542
What do you want to do?

4327
02:54:41.542 --> 02:54:42.523
You can reply to this message.

4328
02:54:42.523 --> 02:54:44.545
MATT: So you guys are 150 feet away from the home.

4329
02:54:44.545 --> 02:54:46.614
The range on Message is 120 feet, so you hear nothing.

4330
02:54:46.614 --> 02:54:48.637
LIAM: Nothing, okay.
ALL: (gasping)

4331
02:54:48.637 --> 02:54:50.916
MARISHA: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: Going to plan.

4332
02:54:50.916 --> 02:54:52.375
SAM: He didn't reply.

4333
02:54:52.375 --> 02:54:53.836
LAURA: Maybe he didn't hear you.

4334
02:54:53.836 --> 02:54:55.780
TRAVIS: One dead, no communication.

4335
02:54:55.780 --> 02:54:57.140
SAM: Would I know that he's too far,

4336
02:54:57.140 --> 02:54:58.484
if I didn't hear a response?

4337
02:54:58.484 --> 02:55:01.352
MATT: Make an intelligence check, actually.

4338
02:55:01.352 --> 02:55:02.185
SAM: Five.

4339
02:55:02.185 --> 02:55:03.477
MATT: Five? No.

4340
02:55:03.477 --> 02:55:05.438
It's weird. He should have responded.

4341
02:55:05.438 --> 02:55:07.974
TRAVIS: (laughing)

4342
02:55:07.974 --> 02:55:09.532
SAM: Maybe he's hiding.

4343
02:55:09.532 --> 02:55:11.179
TRAVIS: We're so good at this.

4344
02:55:11.179 --> 02:55:13.229
LAURA: Yeah, maybe he's in his place and he can't talk.

4345
02:55:13.229 --> 02:55:14.889
LIAM: Literally just had a talk about how

4346
02:55:14.889 --> 02:55:16.925
I felt good about how things are going.

4347
02:55:16.925 --> 02:55:18.305
SAM: Okay.

4348
02:55:18.305 --> 02:55:21.003
MICA: Should I send a friend to go find him?

4349
02:55:21.003 --> 02:55:23.503
SAM: If he didn't reply to me, I'm pretty sure that means

4350
02:55:23.503 --> 02:55:25.442
he doesn't want to speak right now.

4351
02:55:25.442 --> 02:55:26.286
MICA: Oh.

4352
02:55:26.286 --> 02:55:28.589
Okay, well then we'll just leave him alone.

4353
02:55:28.589 --> 02:55:29.494
SAM: Yep.
MATT: Okay.

4354
02:55:29.494 --> 02:55:31.327
MARISHA: All right, well, are we going to go in and find

4355
02:55:31.327 --> 02:55:34.193
this thing everyone knows what we're looking for?

4356
02:55:34.193 --> 02:55:35.942
Should we split up once we're inside?

4357
02:55:35.942 --> 02:55:37.564
SAM: Definitely.
MARISHA: All right.

4358
02:55:37.564 --> 02:55:39.509
LAURA: Hold on.

4359
02:55:39.509 --> 02:55:41.292
LIAM: No, no, no, think!

4360
02:55:42.325 --> 02:55:44.867
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I've got the spell.

4361
02:55:45.933 --> 02:55:47.188
Let me look at it.

4362
02:55:47.188 --> 02:55:48.966
MARISHA: Two and two, split up.

4363
02:55:48.966 --> 02:55:50.756
SAM: There's five of us.

4364
02:55:50.756 --> 02:55:53.164
LAURA: The spell can locate the nearest object

4365
02:55:53.164 --> 02:55:55.174
of a particular kind.

4366
02:55:55.174 --> 02:55:58.065
So, I haven't seen it in person,

4367
02:55:58.065 --> 02:56:01.068
but I know that it's a red ring, right?

4368
02:56:01.068 --> 02:56:03.003
MATT: You do, you know it's a spiraled red metal.

4369
02:56:03.003 --> 02:56:05.182
LAURA: I know it's a spiraled red metal.

4370
02:56:05.182 --> 02:56:07.502
So I'm going to cast Locate Object.

4371
02:56:07.502 --> 02:56:08.685
MARISHA: Yes queen.

4372
02:56:08.685 --> 02:56:11.678
LAURA: And I'm going to think of that specifically.

4373
02:56:11.678 --> 02:56:12.601
MATT: Okay.

4374
02:56:12.601 --> 02:56:14.347
You finish the spell.

4375
02:56:14.347 --> 02:56:16.404
How long is the cast time on this, one action?

4376
02:56:16.404 --> 02:56:17.775
LAURA: Yeah.

4377
02:56:17.775 --> 02:56:19.830
MATT: You concentrate, and you can sense the direction.

4378
02:56:19.830 --> 02:56:22.301
It's below and a little bit in towards

4379
02:56:22.301 --> 02:56:24.407
the wall of the cavern.

4380
02:56:24.407 --> 02:56:28.647
Beyond the threshold of what the visual estate is.

4381
02:56:28.647 --> 02:56:32.263
So you gather this is beyond and deeper into the rock.

4382
02:56:32.263 --> 02:56:35.916
LAURA: Okay, does it feel like what level it would be on?

4383
02:56:35.916 --> 02:56:37.374
MATT: At this angle it's hard to tell.

4384
02:56:37.374 --> 02:56:40.622
It's one or two floors below you, from the roof.

4385
02:56:40.622 --> 02:56:42.017
LAURA: Okay.

4386
02:56:42.017 --> 02:56:44.696
So it's either the second or third level.

4387
02:56:44.696 --> 02:56:46.292
MATT: One of the two probably, you gather.

4388
02:56:46.292 --> 02:56:47.808
MARISHA: This thing's going to be behind

4389
02:56:47.808 --> 02:56:49.183
lock and key for sure.

4390
02:56:49.183 --> 02:56:50.643
LAURA: Yeah.

4391
02:56:50.643 --> 02:56:54.062
MARISHA: Why don't we do this? Why don't we daisy chain it

4392
02:56:54.062 --> 02:56:58.595
and we'll just leave a few people stationed in places.

4393
02:56:58.595 --> 02:57:02.349
That way as you run back, if anything happens--

4394
02:57:02.349 --> 02:57:03.182
Right, maybe?

4395
02:57:03.182 --> 02:57:04.347
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: Or is that terrible?

4396
02:57:04.347 --> 02:57:05.556
SAM: I don't know, we've got to find it first.

4397
02:57:05.556 --> 02:57:06.545
MARISHA: We're all invisible.

4398
02:57:06.545 --> 02:57:09.032
LAURA: Well, you're invisible, me and Nott

4399
02:57:09.032 --> 02:57:11.977
are not invisible anymore.
MARISHA: Yeah, I keep forgetting.

4400
02:57:11.977 --> 02:57:14.481
LAURA: You're invisible, I don't even know.

4401
02:57:14.481 --> 02:57:15.676
MARISHA: Oh, right here.

4402
02:57:15.676 --> 02:57:17.036
LAURA: Okay.
MICA: Hi.

4403
02:57:17.036 --> 02:57:17.921
LAURA: Hi!
MARISHA: Yeah.

4404
02:57:17.921 --> 02:57:19.332
SAM: We can't see where you're pointing.

4405
02:57:19.332 --> 02:57:20.416
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

4406
02:57:20.416 --> 02:57:21.755
(laughter)

4407
02:57:21.755 --> 02:57:23.224
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

4408
02:57:23.224 --> 02:57:25.559
LAURA: We're going, should we--

4409
02:57:25.559 --> 02:57:27.521
MARISHA: Just go.
SAM: Just go in.

4410
02:57:27.521 --> 02:57:30.453
LAURA: I'm going to put my head in and look

4411
02:57:30.453 --> 02:57:32.956
and see if there's anybody in the room below us.

4412
02:57:32.956 --> 02:57:35.352
MATT: Okay, there is no light inside.

4413
02:57:35.352 --> 02:57:37.184
What you're looking down into appears to be

4414
02:57:37.184 --> 02:57:40.001
some sort of a master bedroom-like chamber.

4415
02:57:40.001 --> 02:57:42.484
It's relatively gaudy in its attire,

4416
02:57:42.484 --> 02:57:47.196
dark blue in its coloring, the floor itself is like

4417
02:57:47.196 --> 02:57:52.196
a polished cerulean stone of some type you don't recognize.

4418
02:57:52.864 --> 02:57:55.648
The bed is this garish canopied bed

4419
02:57:55.648 --> 02:57:58.523
with thick curtains, gold trim.

4420
02:57:59.822 --> 02:58:03.428
The elements of carpet and rug that are set out there

4421
02:58:03.428 --> 02:58:07.008
are a dark gray with purple accents.

4422
02:58:07.008 --> 02:58:10.349
The colors are completely not complimentary.

4423
02:58:10.349 --> 02:58:15.349
It is a fairly hideous chamber, in its elegance perceived.

4424
02:58:17.042 --> 02:58:19.251
You see a vanity cabinet next to that,

4425
02:58:19.251 --> 02:58:23.290
you see a mirror above that, you see a dresser,

4426
02:58:23.290 --> 02:58:25.782
and there is a door that leads into a hallway

4427
02:58:25.782 --> 02:58:27.853
that lines up with what may have been

4428
02:58:27.853 --> 02:58:32.163
where the hatch would've descended towards.

4429
02:58:32.163 --> 02:58:33.462
LAURA: Okay.

4430
02:58:33.462 --> 02:58:36.718
LIAM: What do we think, how much time do we think has passed

4431
02:58:36.718 --> 02:58:39.163
since we said goodbye to them?

4432
02:58:39.163 --> 02:58:40.606
MATT: About five minutes.

4433
02:58:40.606 --> 02:58:42.914
LIAM: Yeah, and what can Fjord and Caleb see

4434
02:58:42.914 --> 02:58:44.844
from their vantage point, because we saw three guards,

4435
02:58:44.844 --> 02:58:47.378
all of us, so what do we see? We see

4436
02:58:47.378 --> 02:58:48.998
the same two guards patrolling and--

4437
02:58:48.998 --> 02:58:50.281
MATT: You see two guards patrolling.

4438
02:58:50.281 --> 02:58:51.397
LIAM: And we no longer see--

4439
02:58:51.397 --> 02:58:53.796
TRAVIS: And one dying very quickly?

4440
02:58:53.796 --> 02:58:58.099
MATT: You were watching, and one of them just vanished.

4441
02:58:58.099 --> 02:59:02.383
Actually, both of you make perception checks.

4442
02:59:02.383 --> 02:59:04.202
SAM: Like a stream of blood running down

4443
02:59:04.202 --> 02:59:05.318
the side of the house?

4444
02:59:05.318 --> 02:59:06.763
TRAVIS: The balcony is just dripping?

4445
02:59:06.763 --> 02:59:08.303
(laughter)

4446
02:59:08.303 --> 02:59:09.641
TALIESIN: Into somebody's latte.
LIAM: 20.

4447
02:59:09.641 --> 02:59:11.600
TRAVIS: 12.
MATT: Okay.

4448
02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:12.678
You just see the guard disappear.

4449
02:59:12.678 --> 02:59:16.680
<i>You</i> see a brief moment of a panicked Jester,

4450
02:59:16.680 --> 02:59:19.230
and then she vanishes as well.

4451
02:59:19.230 --> 02:59:21.488
LIAM: So I saw Jester for a blink of an eye,

4452
02:59:21.488 --> 02:59:24.383
and the guard's gone now too, not sure beyond that.

4453
02:59:24.383 --> 02:59:26.017
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Okay.

4454
02:59:26.017 --> 02:59:27.561
Okay, okay.

4455
02:59:27.561 --> 02:59:29.838
Okay, something's-- it's going wrong.

4456
02:59:29.838 --> 02:59:31.004
TRAVIS: Why?

4457
02:59:31.004 --> 02:59:33.529
LIAM: Jester was there with a guy and now the guy

4458
02:59:33.529 --> 02:59:35.195
is not there and Jester's not there.

4459
02:59:35.195 --> 02:59:36.108
TRAVIS: I see he's not there.

4460
02:59:36.108 --> 02:59:36.942
She was there?

4461
02:59:36.942 --> 02:59:37.775
LIAM: Jester was right there and that

4462
02:59:37.775 --> 02:59:39.591
was not part of the plan.
TRAVIS: Why would she do that?

4463
02:59:39.591 --> 02:59:40.947
LIAM: It's Jester.

4464
02:59:40.947 --> 02:59:42.046
(sighs)

4465
02:59:42.046 --> 02:59:44.463
TRAVIS: Supposed to be on the roof.

4466
02:59:47.374 --> 02:59:49.313
LIAM: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4467
02:59:49.313 --> 02:59:51.544
TRAVIS: What are you thinking?

4468
02:59:51.544 --> 02:59:52.841
LIAM: I am not sure.

4469
02:59:52.841 --> 02:59:54.704
I want to give it a minute, perhaps it's better

4470
02:59:54.704 --> 02:59:56.963
to stay out here with you, because we did not

4471
02:59:56.963 --> 02:59:59.086
anticipate this.

4472
02:59:59.086 --> 03:00:00.733
TRAVIS: Oh, right, stay available?

4473
03:00:00.733 --> 03:00:02.493
LIAM: Yeah.

4474
03:00:02.493 --> 03:00:04.580
TRAVIS: What if the distance is too far?

4475
03:00:05.447 --> 03:00:08.592
LIAM: Let's try to get a little bit closer, carefully.

4476
03:00:09.834 --> 03:00:11.001
40 or 50 feet.

4477
03:00:12.079 --> 03:00:12.912
TRAVIS: All right.
LIAM: Yeah.

4478
03:00:12.912 --> 03:00:14.197
MATT: So you go for a little stroll?

4479
03:00:14.197 --> 03:00:15.030
LIAM: Yeah.

4480
03:00:15.030 --> 03:00:17.427
MATT: Okay, you get up to the edge of--

4481
03:00:17.427 --> 03:00:19.434
nearish to the gate, probably about

4482
03:00:19.434 --> 03:00:20.766
100 feet or so from the house.

4483
03:00:20.766 --> 03:00:22.364
LIAM: Okay, I'm pulling out the copper wire.

4484
03:00:22.364 --> 03:00:23.825
(coughing)

4485
03:00:23.825 --> 03:00:26.329
(muffled) What the fuck is going on in there?

4486
03:00:26.329 --> 03:00:28.261
MATT: You hear Caleb message you.

4487
03:00:28.261 --> 03:00:32.277
SAM: Oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, we're inside.

4488
03:00:32.277 --> 03:00:35.755
We had to kill a guard, but we're in on the third floor.

4489
03:00:35.755 --> 03:00:37.938
TALIESIN: You had to what?
MICA: Huh?

4490
03:00:38.877 --> 03:00:40.177
SAM: Um...
LAURA: Um...

4491
03:00:42.293 --> 03:00:43.576
SAM: Shh.

4492
03:00:43.576 --> 03:00:45.139
(laughter)

4493
03:00:45.139 --> 03:00:47.222
TRAVIS: That's not a good face.

4494
03:00:50.097 --> 03:00:52.213
LIAM: Walk with me.

4495
03:00:52.213 --> 03:00:54.380
And we arc around the way.

4496
03:00:56.281 --> 03:00:58.457
(whispering) Nott says that they've murdered someone.

4497
03:00:58.457 --> 03:01:00.276
TRAVIS: (tight whisper) They murdered someone?

4498
03:01:00.276 --> 03:01:03.701
(laughter)

4499
03:01:03.701 --> 03:01:05.114
LIAM: That's what she said.

4500
03:01:05.114 --> 03:01:06.985
TRAVIS: I thought-- that was never part of the plan.

4501
03:01:06.985 --> 03:01:10.188
LIAM: Supposed to make this squeaky clean.

4502
03:01:10.188 --> 03:01:11.921
Five minutes.

4503
03:01:11.921 --> 03:01:14.139
TRAVIS: Where are they now?

4504
03:01:14.139 --> 03:01:15.953
LIAM: Alcohol is a problem for that woman.

4505
03:01:15.953 --> 03:01:17.236
TRAVIS: I know.

4506
03:01:17.236 --> 03:01:18.837
You need to get closer.

4507
03:01:18.837 --> 03:01:21.646
We should move towards the back of the house.

4508
03:01:24.006 --> 03:01:25.285
LIAM: <i>Scheiße.</i>

4509
03:01:25.285 --> 03:01:27.563
(poof poof) We're invisible.

4510
03:01:27.563 --> 03:01:28.860
MATT: Okay.

4511
03:01:28.860 --> 03:01:31.028
(laughter)

4512
03:01:31.028 --> 03:01:32.778
TRAVIS: Warn someone first!

4513
03:01:35.605 --> 03:01:36.605
LIAM: You first.

4514
03:01:37.896 --> 03:01:39.369
On three.

4515
03:01:39.369 --> 03:01:40.266
(laughter)

4516
03:01:40.266 --> 03:01:42.030
TRAVIS: What, what are we doing?
SAM: Go!

4517
03:01:42.030 --> 03:01:45.771
(laughter)

4518
03:01:48.381 --> 03:01:49.766
TALIESIN: Grab her!

4519
03:01:49.766 --> 03:01:51.999
MATT: This is peak Dungeons &amp; Dragons right here.

4520
03:01:51.999 --> 03:01:54.249
(laughter)

4521
03:01:55.298 --> 03:01:56.952
TRAVIS: (panicked whispering) What are we doing?

4522
03:01:56.952 --> 03:01:58.222
LIAM: I'm still here.

4523
03:01:58.222 --> 03:02:00.991
TRAVIS: I know, what are we doing on three?

4524
03:02:00.991 --> 03:02:02.523
You disappeared.

4525
03:02:02.523 --> 03:02:04.494
LIAM: But I'm still with you, Fjord.

4526
03:02:04.494 --> 03:02:07.223
(laughter)

4527
03:02:07.223 --> 03:02:10.727
TRAVIS: What are we doing on three?

4528
03:02:10.727 --> 03:02:14.735
LIAM: We're going to walk to the backside of the house.

4529
03:02:14.735 --> 03:02:16.819
TRAVIS: Why do we have to count for that?

4530
03:02:16.819 --> 03:02:18.213
(laughter)

4531
03:02:18.213 --> 03:02:21.051
LIAM: Well, I don't want us to bump into--

4532
03:02:21.051 --> 03:02:23.281
(laughter)

4533
03:02:23.281 --> 03:02:25.172
TRAVIS: Boobie, boobie, boobies.

4534
03:02:28.074 --> 03:02:30.117
You're crushing my pinky.

4535
03:02:30.117 --> 03:02:32.336
(laughter)

4536
03:02:32.336 --> 03:02:34.412
LIAM: <i>Eins, zwei</i>--

4537
03:02:34.412 --> 03:02:35.478
TRAVIS: What?

4538
03:02:37.098 --> 03:02:38.332
LIAM: --<i>drei</i>!

4539
03:02:38.332 --> 03:02:40.252
(laughter)

4540
03:02:40.252 --> 03:02:41.373
MATT: And?

4541
03:02:41.373 --> 03:02:44.168
LIAM: I start leading him along the right side.

4542
03:02:44.168 --> 03:02:45.839
MATT: Okay, go around the gate.

4543
03:02:45.839 --> 03:02:47.242
(laughter)

4544
03:02:47.242 --> 03:02:49.747
TRAVIS: I'm an invisible baby walking.

4545
03:02:49.747 --> 03:02:52.429
LIAM: I don't want them to just like walk and go bink!

4546
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:53.262
MATT: Okay.

4547
03:02:54.113 --> 03:02:57.317
You slowly make your way along the far side

4548
03:02:57.317 --> 03:03:00.707
where the iron gate meets the end wall

4549
03:03:00.707 --> 03:03:03.493
on that side of the cavern along the exterior

4550
03:03:03.493 --> 03:03:04.906
of the courtyard.

4551
03:03:04.906 --> 03:03:05.795
All right, in the meantime, you guys

4552
03:03:05.795 --> 03:03:07.601
are inside the bedchamber.

4553
03:03:07.601 --> 03:03:10.018
SAM: Oh. Caduceus, I can see you again, great.

4554
03:03:10.018 --> 03:03:11.076
TALIESIN: You can?

4555
03:03:11.076 --> 03:03:12.449
MATT: Yeah, all the invisibility drops on you guys.

4556
03:03:12.449 --> 03:03:13.784
TALIESIN: In that case--
MARISHA: All of us?

4557
03:03:13.784 --> 03:03:14.794
MATT: Yes.

4558
03:03:14.794 --> 03:03:15.943
LAURA: Right, because he cast it on--

4559
03:03:15.943 --> 03:03:18.099
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Find Traps really quickly.

4560
03:03:18.099 --> 03:03:19.482
MATT: Find Traps?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

4561
03:03:19.482 --> 03:03:20.402
LAURA: Awesome.

4562
03:03:20.402 --> 03:03:22.710
MATT: That points them out, to what range?

4563
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:24.171
TALIESIN: 120 feet.

4564
03:03:24.171 --> 03:03:25.480
MATT: 120 feet.

4565
03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:26.835
SAM: Where'd you get all these spells?

4566
03:03:26.835 --> 03:03:28.876
MATT: He had a night to prep, yo.
TALIESIN: I had a night to prep.

4567
03:03:28.876 --> 03:03:30.009
SAM: Damn.
MICA: Smart.

4568
03:03:30.009 --> 03:03:31.463
All right.

4569
03:03:31.463 --> 03:03:33.719
TALIESIN: I'm built for espionage today, not for healing.

4570
03:03:33.719 --> 03:03:34.630
SAM: That's great.

4571
03:03:34.630 --> 03:03:37.469
MATT: Not for healing, so--
TALIESIN: Don't get hurt.

4572
03:03:37.469 --> 03:03:42.009
MATT: All right, you sense a trap directly beneath

4573
03:03:42.009 --> 03:03:43.815
the vanity cabinet.

4574
03:03:43.815 --> 03:03:45.587
MICA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Trap.

4575
03:03:45.587 --> 03:03:47.737
MATT: You also sense a trap

4576
03:03:49.378 --> 03:03:51.436
seemingly beyond the hallway,

4577
03:03:51.436 --> 03:03:53.630
like the door, and there's the hall beyond,

4578
03:03:53.630 --> 03:03:57.255
and there's a trap about 30 feet beyond there.

4579
03:03:57.255 --> 03:03:59.922
TALIESIN: There's a trap on the other side of the door,

4580
03:03:59.922 --> 03:04:02.829
possibly the door itself, and then like another 30 feet.

4581
03:04:02.829 --> 03:04:05.259
MATT: You also sense a handful of various other traps

4582
03:04:05.259 --> 03:04:07.355
set throughout the house on the bottom floor.

4583
03:04:07.355 --> 03:04:09.262
TALIESIN: The bottom floor is a nightmare.

4584
03:04:09.262 --> 03:04:10.956
We're just, if we go down there, it's going to be--

4585
03:04:10.956 --> 03:04:13.091
SAM: But in this room, you pointed to the vanity.

4586
03:04:13.091 --> 03:04:14.287
TALIESIN: The vanity is trapped, yeah.

4587
03:04:14.287 --> 03:04:15.520
SAM: Is that something that we should investigate,

4588
03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:17.383
or we don't think it would be in a master bedroom?

4589
03:04:17.383 --> 03:04:19.108
TALIESIN: I feel like if I tell you no,

4590
03:04:19.108 --> 03:04:20.200
you're going to do it anyway.

4591
03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:23.739
SAM: No, I'm all ears.

4592
03:04:23.739 --> 03:04:25.584
MATT: It's like underneath the vanity.

4593
03:04:25.584 --> 03:04:29.088
TALIESIN: There's a trap like underneath the vanity.

4594
03:04:29.088 --> 03:04:32.371
SAM: Do you want to look at it?

4595
03:04:33.310 --> 03:04:34.897
TALIESIN: I don't know.

4596
03:04:34.897 --> 03:04:36.397
I'm very confused.

4597
03:04:37.339 --> 03:04:39.520
I also don't really know, because I can't

4598
03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:42.496
really see the vanity, because it's pitch black in here.

4599
03:04:42.496 --> 03:04:44.581
So I have no real idea.

4600
03:04:44.581 --> 03:04:46.214
I just know that there-- I can kind of--

4601
03:04:46.214 --> 03:04:47.705
I have echolocation.

4602
03:04:47.705 --> 03:04:49.993
SAM: All right.
MATT: (chuckles)

4603
03:04:49.993 --> 03:04:53.199
Firbolg's just-- (clicking tongue)

4604
03:04:53.199 --> 03:04:55.044
SAM: Should I try to disarm it?

4605
03:04:55.044 --> 03:04:56.114
Is that a thing?

4606
03:04:56.114 --> 03:04:57.149
MICA: Why? We don't need it.

4607
03:04:57.149 --> 03:04:58.209
TALIESIN: I think we should skip it.

4608
03:04:58.209 --> 03:04:59.434
SAM: What if it's hiding the ring?

4609
03:04:59.434 --> 03:05:00.655
Maybe the ring's in there.

4610
03:05:00.655 --> 03:05:01.671
MARISHA: No, Jester knows that the ring

4611
03:05:01.671 --> 03:05:02.954
is down the corridor a bit.

4612
03:05:02.954 --> 03:05:04.340
SAM: Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right.

4613
03:05:04.340 --> 03:05:06.795
So wait, can you point to the direction

4614
03:05:06.795 --> 03:05:08.655
that the ring is, and Caduceus,

4615
03:05:08.655 --> 03:05:11.148
you point to where that other trap was, 30 feet beyond.

4616
03:05:11.148 --> 03:05:13.068
Are they pointing in the same direction?

4617
03:05:13.068 --> 03:05:15.223
MATT: No, Caduceus is a little off to the right.

4618
03:05:15.223 --> 03:05:17.257
Like, Caduceus is pointing towards the vanity,

4619
03:05:17.257 --> 03:05:19.910
towards the base of it, Jester's pointing down the hall,

4620
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:21.321
in the direction of the trap that you--

4621
03:05:21.321 --> 03:05:22.980
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, that was--

4622
03:05:22.980 --> 03:05:24.474
SAM: Point to the other trap.

4623
03:05:24.474 --> 03:05:25.760
TALIESIN: There's a trap that way.
MARISHA: The down the hall trap.

4624
03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:26.593
SAM: Are they now?

4625
03:05:26.593 --> 03:05:28.414
MATT: The one that's 30 feet beyond, the next one,

4626
03:05:28.414 --> 03:05:29.972
those are both in a similar direction.

4627
03:05:29.972 --> 03:05:31.505
SAM: Okay, that's where it is. Let's go.

4628
03:05:31.505 --> 03:05:32.591
MARISHA: That's got to be where it is.

4629
03:05:32.591 --> 03:05:33.702
TALIESIN: Question.
SAM: Yes?

4630
03:05:33.702 --> 03:05:35.298
TALIESIN: Is it possible that there's a key for something

4631
03:05:35.298 --> 03:05:38.823
in that other-- beneath the vanity?

4632
03:05:38.823 --> 03:05:39.914
LAURA: Oh.

4633
03:05:39.914 --> 03:05:41.281
MARISHA: There might be a key.

4634
03:05:41.281 --> 03:05:42.940
Are there any other traps in here in general?

4635
03:05:42.940 --> 03:05:44.511
LAURA: Oh, like maybe they're keeping a key--

4636
03:05:44.511 --> 03:05:46.329
TALIESIN: That's the only trap that I'm reading

4637
03:05:46.329 --> 03:05:48.378
is the one beneath the vanity, right?

4638
03:05:48.378 --> 03:05:49.597
MATT: Currently.

4639
03:05:49.597 --> 03:05:50.671
MARISHA: Goggles on.

4640
03:05:50.671 --> 03:05:52.815
I'm going to quickly rummage through some drawers

4641
03:05:52.815 --> 03:05:54.199
in the vanity, look for keys or anything.

4642
03:05:54.199 --> 03:05:55.842
SAM: Watch out for the trap.
TALIESIN: The trap.

4643
03:05:55.842 --> 03:05:57.708
MARISHA: No, I'm not going to go under the trap.

4644
03:05:57.708 --> 03:05:59.017
I'm looking in the--
SAM: That's where it would be.

4645
03:05:59.017 --> 03:06:01.173
LAURA: Yeah, don't--
MARISHA: I'm going to avoid the trap.

4646
03:06:01.173 --> 03:06:03.661
MATT: You look in the vanity, and you find a series of like,

4647
03:06:03.661 --> 03:06:07.379
facial powders, you find some gloves.

4648
03:06:07.379 --> 03:06:10.595
It looks like a bunch of evening wear accessories

4649
03:06:10.595 --> 03:06:13.938
that begins and more of just basic makeup,

4650
03:06:13.938 --> 03:06:16.966
and then eventually leads into various bits

4651
03:06:16.966 --> 03:06:18.874
of smaller accoutrement for what would be

4652
03:06:18.874 --> 03:06:21.587
a formal gown or attire.

4653
03:06:21.587 --> 03:06:23.163
LAURA: Question.
MATT: Yes.

4654
03:06:23.163 --> 03:06:27.100
LAURA: Are there doors in this room leading to the balcony?

4655
03:06:27.100 --> 03:06:29.084
MATT: Yes, there is the glass door

4656
03:06:29.084 --> 03:06:30.509
and the glass windows that are on

4657
03:06:30.509 --> 03:06:32.558
the opposite side of the balcony you guys first appeared on.

4658
03:06:32.558 --> 03:06:34.815
LAURA: Can we see through them outside?

4659
03:06:34.815 --> 03:06:37.260
MATT: You can see a faint bit of light that's coming

4660
03:06:37.260 --> 03:06:39.105
from just the general atmospheric light

4661
03:06:39.105 --> 03:06:41.884
of the interior of Uthodurn's street,

4662
03:06:41.884 --> 03:06:44.487
and the area around you, and the lanterns

4663
03:06:44.487 --> 03:06:47.128
that are now lit up in the area, but it's all diffused

4664
03:06:47.128 --> 03:06:50.584
through the weirdly textured fogged glass,

4665
03:06:50.584 --> 03:06:52.765
so you can't make out more than just a faint bit of light.

4666
03:06:52.765 --> 03:06:54.711
It's refracted.

4667
03:06:54.711 --> 03:06:56.786
TRAVIS: What color is the glass?

4668
03:06:56.786 --> 03:06:59.906
MATT: It's like a faint bluish-green, I guess you could say.

4669
03:06:59.906 --> 03:07:03.998
Like a hint of teal, mostly clear, but a hint of teal to it.

4670
03:07:03.998 --> 03:07:07.283
MARISHA: It's probably just jewelry or something in there.

4671
03:07:07.283 --> 03:07:08.599
TALIESIN: I would say,

4672
03:07:08.599 --> 03:07:12.290
I'm learning to let go of control of things.

4673
03:07:12.290 --> 03:07:13.144
MARISHA: What?

4674
03:07:13.144 --> 03:07:15.183
TALIESIN: If the trap looks like something you can

4675
03:07:15.183 --> 03:07:18.926
figure out how to disarm, and if you're feeling confident,

4676
03:07:18.926 --> 03:07:21.798
then I'd say fine, but if you don't, if it looks dangerous,

4677
03:07:21.798 --> 03:07:23.031
we might as well keep moving.

4678
03:07:23.031 --> 03:07:24.841
SAM: I will investigate the trap.

4679
03:07:24.841 --> 03:07:27.820
MATT: Okay, roll an investigation check.

4680
03:07:27.820 --> 03:07:29.241
SAM: 15.

4681
03:07:29.241 --> 03:07:30.851
MATT: 15.

4682
03:07:30.851 --> 03:07:34.563
It is, indeed-- what you find is not the vanity itself,

4683
03:07:34.563 --> 03:07:37.270
but beneath it there is a small metallic lock box

4684
03:07:37.270 --> 03:07:40.475
that has been slipped beneath the vanity,

4685
03:07:40.475 --> 03:07:42.668
and there's a little compartment that's pushed up

4686
03:07:42.668 --> 03:07:45.261
and slid inside, so you can try and remove it.

4687
03:07:45.261 --> 03:07:47.831
There isn't a trap on the space,

4688
03:07:47.831 --> 03:07:50.348
but the actual latch on the vanity

4689
03:07:50.348 --> 03:07:52.773
has some sort of a mechanism.

4690
03:07:52.773 --> 03:07:55.435
It doesn't look super complicated,

4691
03:07:55.435 --> 03:07:58.557
but it's not a simple trap either.

4692
03:07:58.557 --> 03:08:00.199
SAM: I think I've got this.

4693
03:08:00.199 --> 03:08:02.478
I'll take a little nip of booze

4694
03:08:02.478 --> 03:08:04.487
and I'll try to disarm the trap.

4695
03:08:04.487 --> 03:08:06.918
MATT: Go for it, give me a thieves' tools check.

4696
03:08:06.918 --> 03:08:08.254
SAM: 20.
TALIESIN: Backing up.

4697
03:08:08.254 --> 03:08:09.439
MATT: 20.
MARISHA: Ooh.

4698
03:08:09.439 --> 03:08:12.072
MATT: (clicking)

4699
03:08:12.072 --> 03:08:16.919
You feel a spring go, and you're like, nothing happens.

4700
03:08:16.919 --> 03:08:19.676
SAM: (sighs)

4701
03:08:19.676 --> 03:08:20.972
MATT: So the trap is--

4702
03:08:20.972 --> 03:08:22.467
SAM: I will open it.

4703
03:08:22.467 --> 03:08:23.381
MATT: All right.

4704
03:08:23.381 --> 03:08:24.926
Well, it is locked as well.

4705
03:08:24.926 --> 03:08:26.567
SAM: Oh, Jesus.
MATT: (laughing)

4706
03:08:26.567 --> 03:08:29.002
SAM: All right, now I'll try to pick the lock.

4707
03:08:29.002 --> 03:08:30.085
25.

4708
03:08:30.085 --> 03:08:31.284
MATT: 25.
LAURA: Ooh.

4709
03:08:31.284 --> 03:08:33.113
MATT: It's a pretty tough lock and you manage

4710
03:08:33.113 --> 03:08:35.084
to just barely find it.

4711
03:08:35.084 --> 03:08:37.341
The tumblers are arranged strangely,

4712
03:08:37.341 --> 03:08:39.624
and you have to feel around for them.

4713
03:08:39.624 --> 03:08:41.341
You haven't encountered a lock like this.

4714
03:08:41.341 --> 03:08:44.230
But it's not entirely unlike others you've encountered,

4715
03:08:44.230 --> 03:08:46.629
you just have to adjust the arrangement in your mind,

4716
03:08:46.629 --> 03:08:48.885
and you eventually find it after maybe a minute or so

4717
03:08:48.885 --> 03:08:50.920
of fiddling with it.

4718
03:08:50.920 --> 03:08:53.299
It opens up and on the inside you see a pile of jewelry.

4719
03:08:53.299 --> 03:08:55.606
Like, fine gold and platinum necklaces,

4720
03:08:55.606 --> 03:08:58.511
with pearls and gems embedded in it.

4721
03:08:58.511 --> 03:09:01.473
It looks like a beautiful set of formal jewelry.

4722
03:09:01.473 --> 03:09:04.482
You also see a vial, a potion

4723
03:09:04.482 --> 03:09:06.607
that looks empty--

4724
03:09:07.457 --> 03:09:09.349
like a glass vial--

4725
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:12.476
and a letter that's folded.

4726
03:09:12.476 --> 03:09:14.595
LAURA: (whispering) Take the letter, read the letter.

4727
03:09:14.595 --> 03:09:15.851
SAM: You want to read it now?

4728
03:09:15.851 --> 03:09:17.349
Get the thing first.

4729
03:09:17.349 --> 03:09:18.907
We'll take everything.

4730
03:09:18.907 --> 03:09:19.740
SAM: Okay, you got it.

4731
03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:20.789
TALIESIN: Put it back.

4732
03:09:20.789 --> 03:09:23.021
SAM: Reani, we're just taking this in case

4733
03:09:23.021 --> 03:09:24.553
it's useful in the next room.

4734
03:09:24.553 --> 03:09:26.725
MICA: (monotone) These people are bad.

4735
03:09:26.725 --> 03:09:28.417
It is good.

4736
03:09:29.955 --> 03:09:31.539
SAM: If we find--

4737
03:09:31.539 --> 03:09:33.193
MICA: Her eye kind of twitches.

4738
03:09:33.193 --> 03:09:35.005
(laughter)

4739
03:09:35.005 --> 03:09:36.713
LAURA: If they're good, we'll put it all back.

4740
03:09:36.713 --> 03:09:38.021
How about that?

4741
03:09:39.639 --> 03:09:40.726
MARISHA: Maybe there's something in the letter

4742
03:09:40.726 --> 03:09:41.673
that says they're bad.

4743
03:09:41.673 --> 03:09:44.308
SAM: I'll hand the letter to someone.

4744
03:09:44.308 --> 03:09:45.704
I'll rip it in half.

4745
03:09:45.704 --> 03:09:46.842
(laughter)

4746
03:09:46.842 --> 03:09:48.386
LAURA: Yeah, Beau will definitely read it.

4747
03:09:48.386 --> 03:09:50.764
TALIESIN: So is the next trap where the door is,

4748
03:09:50.764 --> 03:09:52.030
or is it beyond the door?

4749
03:09:52.030 --> 03:09:53.568
LAURA: Beyond the door.
TALIESIN: It's beyond the door.

4750
03:09:53.568 --> 03:09:54.463
TALIESIN: Okay.

4751
03:09:54.463 --> 03:09:55.796
MATT: The paper is blank.

4752
03:09:55.796 --> 03:09:57.356
MARISHA: Bullshit.

4753
03:09:57.356 --> 03:09:58.506
LAURA: (gasps) Invisible ink!

4754
03:09:58.506 --> 03:09:59.689
MARISHA: It's a fucking' scroll or invisible ink

4755
03:09:59.689 --> 03:10:01.723
or something like that, and there's some sort of a--

4756
03:10:01.723 --> 03:10:03.466
TRAVIS: A vial that seems to be empty.

4757
03:10:03.466 --> 03:10:06.404
SAM: Wait wait, there's a vial, there's a vial.

4758
03:10:06.404 --> 03:10:07.470
MARISHA: Can you check out the vial

4759
03:10:07.470 --> 03:10:08.853
with your alchemy skills?

4760
03:10:08.853 --> 03:10:09.849
Can you see what it is?

4761
03:10:09.849 --> 03:10:11.634
SAM: I'm going to just shake the vial next to my ear

4762
03:10:11.634 --> 03:10:13.179
and see if I hear any liquid in it.

4763
03:10:13.179 --> 03:10:14.815
MATT: There's liquid in it.
LAURA: (gasping)

4764
03:10:14.815 --> 03:10:16.695
MATT: But it looks and appears empty,

4765
03:10:16.695 --> 03:10:18.277
and you glance at it, and you can see,

4766
03:10:18.277 --> 03:10:21.020
it's a faint-- it's not even like water,

4767
03:10:21.020 --> 03:10:23.056
it's almost like, are you familiar with aerogel?

4768
03:10:23.056 --> 03:10:24.599
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, love it.

4769
03:10:24.599 --> 03:10:27.492
MATT: Where it looks like there's liquid in there,

4770
03:10:27.492 --> 03:10:31.656
but almost not. It's like a ghostly liquid,

4771
03:10:31.656 --> 03:10:34.033
it's hard to--
MARISHA: It's totally invisible ink.

4772
03:10:34.033 --> 03:10:35.337
SAM: For sure.

4773
03:10:35.337 --> 03:10:36.904
But pouring it on won't make the ink--

4774
03:10:36.904 --> 03:10:38.541
LAURA: No.

4775
03:10:38.541 --> 03:10:40.360
MARISHA: But that's the ink that's probably--

4776
03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:41.771
SAM: No, I assume so, but--

4777
03:10:41.771 --> 03:10:43.889
MARISHA: Maybe there's something in the jewelry.

4778
03:10:43.889 --> 03:10:46.033
LAURA: Maybe Dispel Magic?
MARISHA: Yeah.

4779
03:10:46.033 --> 03:10:47.156
SAM: Okay.

4780
03:10:47.156 --> 03:10:49.350
Just pocket it for now.
LAURA: Pocket it for now.

4781
03:10:49.350 --> 03:10:50.385
MATT: Okay.

4782
03:10:50.385 --> 03:10:51.774
SAM: Shall we go to the trap?

4783
03:10:51.774 --> 03:10:52.707
TRAVIS: (whispering) Unless it's instructions

4784
03:10:52.707 --> 03:10:54.366
on how to get into the vault.

4785
03:10:54.366 --> 03:10:55.207
MARISHA: I know.

4786
03:10:55.207 --> 03:10:56.048
SAM: All right, we're going to make our way

4787
03:10:56.048 --> 03:10:56.881
out the door to the trap.

4788
03:10:56.881 --> 03:10:59.645
MICA: Wait, before we make our way out the door.

4789
03:10:59.645 --> 03:11:03.987
I want to conjure an elemental cat.

4790
03:11:04.847 --> 03:11:06.637
No.

4791
03:11:06.637 --> 03:11:07.637
SAM: No.

4792
03:11:10.191 --> 03:11:12.341
MICA: A small-- a small--

4793
03:11:14.135 --> 03:11:15.849
A small gopher of some sort.

4794
03:11:15.849 --> 03:11:17.515
A small rodent.

4795
03:11:17.515 --> 03:11:20.607
MATT: (rodent noises)

4796
03:11:20.607 --> 03:11:23.398
MICA: You will go first, because if any of the traps

4797
03:11:23.398 --> 03:11:26.398
are bad and hurt us, unfortunately,

4798
03:11:26.398 --> 03:11:28.523
we will sacrifice this gopher.

4799
03:11:28.523 --> 03:11:29.660
SAM: All right.

4800
03:11:29.660 --> 03:11:30.493
TALIESIN: Hmm.

4801
03:11:30.493 --> 03:11:32.871
LAURA: Nott can also dismantle the traps that we found.

4802
03:11:32.871 --> 03:11:34.982
MICA: What if Nott can't?

4803
03:11:34.982 --> 03:11:36.070
SAM: Okay.

4804
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:38.162
LAURA: If Nott cannot, then--
MICA: The gopher goes first.

4805
03:11:38.162 --> 03:11:40.032
TRAVIS: What if the wifi password's on that

4806
03:11:40.032 --> 03:11:41.283
invisible piece of paper?

4807
03:11:41.283 --> 03:11:43.622
MATT: Sacrificial gopher has been summoned.

4808
03:11:43.622 --> 03:11:46.099
You go to exit, and the door's locked.

4809
03:11:46.099 --> 03:11:50.003
SAM: The door's locked in the bedroom from the inside?

4810
03:11:50.003 --> 03:11:51.678
From the outside?

4811
03:11:53.172 --> 03:11:54.330
Shit.

4812
03:11:54.330 --> 03:11:56.238
MARISHA: What if we--

4813
03:11:56.238 --> 03:11:59.979
if I hold up the letter in front of the lock,

4814
03:11:59.979 --> 03:12:03.203
when you cast Dispel Magic, can we get a two for one deal?

4815
03:12:03.203 --> 03:12:04.141
LAURA: I don't think so.

4816
03:12:04.141 --> 03:12:06.492
MATT: It doesn't work that way.

4817
03:12:06.492 --> 03:12:08.102
SAM: I'll try to pick the lock.

4818
03:12:08.102 --> 03:12:09.236
MATT: Roll for it.

4819
03:12:10.220 --> 03:12:12.201
SAM: Terrible, 16.

4820
03:12:12.201 --> 03:12:13.736
MATT: 16?

4821
03:12:13.736 --> 03:12:15.734
(clicking)

4822
03:12:15.734 --> 03:12:17.012
It's not opening.

4823
03:12:17.012 --> 03:12:21.965
LAURA: I'm going to cast Dispel Magic on the--

4824
03:12:21.965 --> 03:12:23.904
SAM: Did I discern the-- oh, on that.

4825
03:12:23.904 --> 03:12:25.240
LAURA: On the piece of paper.

4826
03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:26.243
MATT: Okay.

4827
03:12:26.243 --> 03:12:28.051
You cast Dispel Magic.

4828
03:12:28.051 --> 03:12:32.106
There's a very faint wave of arcane energy,

4829
03:12:32.106 --> 03:12:35.581
very faint, like a visible breeze for an instant,

4830
03:12:35.581 --> 03:12:37.944
and suddenly this ink appears across the page.

4831
03:12:37.944 --> 03:12:39.711
LAURA: Quick Beau, read it, read it.

4832
03:12:39.711 --> 03:12:41.474
MARISHA: I speed read it.

4833
03:12:41.474 --> 03:12:45.210
MATT: So glancing through it, it's encoded,

4834
03:12:45.210 --> 03:12:50.184
meaning the phrases don't seem to make sense initially,

4835
03:12:50.184 --> 03:12:52.781
but go ahead and make an investigation check for me.

4836
03:12:52.781 --> 03:12:56.504
MARISHA: Do I get like a bonus because that's my specialty?

4837
03:12:56.504 --> 03:12:58.561
MATT: I mean, you get a bonus as
part of your class, so yeah.

4838
03:12:58.561 --> 03:13:00.739
TRAVIS: She get a bonus for that hair?

4839
03:13:00.739 --> 03:13:01.572
SAM: Yes.

4840
03:13:01.572 --> 03:13:03.238
MARISHA: Just investigation?
MATT: Just investigation check.

4841
03:13:03.238 --> 03:13:05.037
TALIESIN: It is like cyberpunk noir.

4842
03:13:05.037 --> 03:13:06.932
TRAVIS: That's like plus one.

4843
03:13:06.932 --> 03:13:08.398
MARISHA: All right.

4844
03:13:08.398 --> 03:13:10.656
Oh wait, no, sorry, sorry, sorry, just one, just one.

4845
03:13:10.656 --> 03:13:12.895
MATT: Just one, yeah.

4846
03:13:12.895 --> 03:13:14.686
MARISHA: Okay.

4847
03:13:14.686 --> 03:13:15.519
15?

4848
03:13:15.519 --> 03:13:17.486
MATT: 15, okay.

4849
03:13:17.486 --> 03:13:21.121
The series of sentences that seem disjointed,

4850
03:13:21.121 --> 03:13:24.012
you're familiar with this type of subtext.

4851
03:13:24.012 --> 03:13:28.478
A lot of smuggling, a lot of illegal trade.

4852
03:13:28.478 --> 03:13:31.143
A lot of things that deal with that

4853
03:13:31.143 --> 03:13:33.496
are encoded through sentences in which

4854
03:13:33.496 --> 03:13:35.509
you're supposed to pull and arrange words separately,

4855
03:13:35.509 --> 03:13:38.418
and there is an insinuation through a lot of it.

4856
03:13:38.418 --> 03:13:40.684
This seems to be talking about

4857
03:13:41.658 --> 03:13:45.811
deliveries and acquisitions that have been requested.

4858
03:13:45.811 --> 03:13:49.008
It talks about a delay, to have patience.

4859
03:13:49.008 --> 03:13:51.458
It is signed with a

4860
03:13:51.458 --> 03:13:53.214
"I.J."

4861
03:13:53.214 --> 03:13:56.097
I-dot-J-dot.

4862
03:13:57.289 --> 03:13:58.322
LAURA: Dot.

4863
03:14:01.678 --> 03:14:03.223
I-dot-J-dot.

4864
03:14:03.223 --> 03:14:05.960
MARISHA: Look for--
SAM: I'm looking.

4865
03:14:05.960 --> 03:14:07.777
Definitely nefarious, Reani.

4866
03:14:07.777 --> 03:14:09.591
These are bad people.
MICA: Bad people.

4867
03:14:09.591 --> 03:14:11.272
LAURA: This sounds like slavers to me.

4868
03:14:11.272 --> 03:14:13.715
(gasps)

4869
03:14:13.715 --> 03:14:14.988
MICA: That's the worst.

4870
03:14:14.988 --> 03:14:18.057
SAM: Or even worse than that.

4871
03:14:18.057 --> 03:14:20.082
TALIESIN: Antique dealers?

4872
03:14:20.082 --> 03:14:21.099
SAM: Yes.

4873
03:14:21.099 --> 03:14:22.407
MICA: No!

4874
03:14:22.407 --> 03:14:23.540
MATT: I-dot-J.

4875
03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:26.256
MICA: Not Antiques Roadshow.

4876
03:14:26.256 --> 03:14:27.622
Don't make me watch it.

4877
03:14:27.622 --> 03:14:30.061
SAM: All right, so we're stuck in this room.

4878
03:14:30.061 --> 03:14:32.080
Can anyone open this door, Caduceus, you said

4879
03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:35.875
you're outfitted for stealth?

4880
03:14:35.875 --> 03:14:39.042
TALIESIN: Well, there's some stuff I could do.

4881
03:14:40.118 --> 03:14:42.161
SAM: Or Reani, can you make--

4882
03:14:42.161 --> 03:14:44.195
LAURA: Are there metal hinges on here?

4883
03:14:44.195 --> 03:14:45.302
SAM: I could do a Mage Hand.

4884
03:14:45.302 --> 03:14:46.368
MATT: There are metal hims hinges, yeah.

4885
03:14:46.368 --> 03:14:48.870
MICA: Is there a keyhole which one could possibly

4886
03:14:48.870 --> 03:14:51.587
morph into something tiny and fly through it?

4887
03:14:52.712 --> 03:14:54.492
MATT: Possibly, yeah.

4888
03:14:54.492 --> 03:14:55.472
Have to be super tiny.

4889
03:14:55.472 --> 03:14:57.253
There is a keyhole, yeah.

4890
03:14:58.637 --> 03:15:00.184
MICA: Don't want to use my last Wild Shape.

4891
03:15:00.184 --> 03:15:01.161
LAURA: Don't do it.

4892
03:15:01.161 --> 03:15:03.228
SAM: Yeah, yeah, do it. We're stuck in the room.

4893
03:15:03.228 --> 03:15:04.296
LAURA: No.
SAM: Of course do it.

4894
03:15:04.296 --> 03:15:06.167
LAURA: We're not, I'm going to use my paint.

4895
03:15:06.167 --> 03:15:07.884
SAM: Oh.
MICA: Oh.

4896
03:15:07.884 --> 03:15:09.548
MATT: All right, so what are you painting?

4897
03:15:09.548 --> 03:15:11.473
LIAM: Don't you mean, "Oh!"

4898
03:15:11.473 --> 03:15:13.540
SAM: Don't waste too much, you could just make it--

4899
03:15:13.540 --> 03:15:15.724
TALIESIN: We can make a little pearl hole.

4900
03:15:15.724 --> 03:15:18.642
LAURA: I have a feeling they're locked from both sides,

4901
03:15:18.642 --> 03:15:21.723
but I was wondering, maybe I can paint like a lot of rust

4902
03:15:21.723 --> 03:15:23.942
on the hinges to where they just break,

4903
03:15:23.942 --> 03:15:26.634
like totally corroded hinges.

4904
03:15:26.634 --> 03:15:28.067
MICA: Hmm.

4905
03:15:28.067 --> 03:15:29.341
MATT: You can certainly try.

4906
03:15:29.341 --> 03:15:31.269
SAM: Do you have a dapple sponge?

4907
03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:32.627
LAURA: Of course I do.

4908
03:15:32.627 --> 03:15:34.159
MATT: So you attempt it?

4909
03:15:34.159 --> 03:15:36.698
You go ahead and paint this heavy, heavy rust

4910
03:15:36.698 --> 03:15:40.785
and like crack marks and breaks across the hinges.

4911
03:15:40.785 --> 03:15:43.734
Go ahead and make a--

4912
03:15:43.734 --> 03:15:45.759
make a dexterity check for me.

4913
03:15:49.620 --> 03:15:50.537
LAURA: 22.
SAM: Ooh.

4914
03:15:51.506 --> 03:15:53.498
MATT: The details are pristine.

4915
03:15:53.498 --> 03:15:56.057
You would think this is all natural rust.

4916
03:15:56.057 --> 03:15:56.905
Incredible.

4917
03:15:56.905 --> 03:15:57.936
The paint sets in.

4918
03:15:57.936 --> 03:16:00.986
Man, that's a fucked door.

4919
03:16:00.986 --> 03:16:01.819
LAURA: Yank it.

4920
03:16:01.819 --> 03:16:03.592
MATT: Roll a strength check.

4921
03:16:06.173 --> 03:16:07.006
LAURA: 21.

4922
03:16:07.006 --> 03:16:08.553
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: 21.

4923
03:16:08.553 --> 03:16:10.623
It snaps right off the hinges.

4924
03:16:10.623 --> 03:16:13.418
The door comes off in Jester's hands.

4925
03:16:13.418 --> 03:16:14.754
SAM: So cool.

4926
03:16:14.754 --> 03:16:16.279
TRAVIS: Slick.

4927
03:16:17.457 --> 03:16:19.315
Good use of it.

4928
03:16:20.319 --> 03:16:23.047
LAURA: I'm trying to use like, little amounts of paint.

4929
03:16:23.047 --> 03:16:24.404
(laughs)

4930
03:16:24.404 --> 03:16:25.237
Okay.

4931
03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:27.726
SAM: All right, we're through.

4932
03:16:27.726 --> 03:16:28.559
LAURA: All right.

4933
03:16:28.559 --> 03:16:30.610
SAM: I'll help her set the door down gently.

4934
03:16:30.610 --> 03:16:33.754
LAURA: What about Caleb and Fjord,
are they coming in or what?

4935
03:16:33.754 --> 03:16:34.587
SAM: I'll check.

4936
03:16:34.587 --> 03:16:36.030
Take out my wire.

4937
03:16:36.030 --> 03:16:38.433
Caleb, Caleb are you coming in the room?

4938
03:16:38.433 --> 03:16:40.350
We're in the house--
MATT: You guys are at the edge.

4939
03:16:40.350 --> 03:16:41.805
LIAM: We're standing at the gate, invisible,

4940
03:16:41.805 --> 03:16:43.803
watching two guards do this, right?

4941
03:16:43.803 --> 03:16:45.404
MATT: Yep.
LIAM: Yeah.

4942
03:16:45.404 --> 03:16:46.644
MATT: Anything else?

4943
03:16:46.644 --> 03:16:48.624
LIAM: Did that just come through?

4944
03:16:48.624 --> 03:16:51.898
MATT: That just comes through.
SAM: Are you coming in?

4945
03:16:51.898 --> 03:16:54.856
LIAM: (whispering) We are at the gate, and

4946
03:16:55.981 --> 03:16:59.060
the guard on the balcony is gone.

4947
03:16:59.060 --> 03:17:00.977
You want us to come in?

4948
03:17:02.091 --> 03:17:04.897
SAM: He wants to know if we want him to come in.

4949
03:17:04.897 --> 03:17:08.358
LAURA: Well, I have a feeling this is going to be, like--

4950
03:17:08.358 --> 03:17:09.882
MARISHA: Quick in and out.

4951
03:17:09.882 --> 03:17:11.238
LAURA: You think it will be quick?

4952
03:17:11.238 --> 03:17:13.149
MARISHA: I don't know. I hope it will be.

4953
03:17:13.149 --> 03:17:14.899
TRAVIS: The old in and out?

4954
03:17:16.569 --> 03:17:20.227
SAM: Yes, come inside if you can,

4955
03:17:20.227 --> 03:17:22.228
but no rush.

4956
03:17:22.228 --> 03:17:23.094
LAURA: What?

4957
03:17:23.094 --> 03:17:24.707
LIAM: And I reply--
SAM: I don't know.

4958
03:17:24.707 --> 03:17:26.223
LIAM: Caleb replies to that message:

4959
03:17:26.223 --> 03:17:28.753
One of us or both of us?

4960
03:17:28.753 --> 03:17:30.414
LAURA: Tell him both.

4961
03:17:30.414 --> 03:17:31.602
SAM: Both?

4962
03:17:31.602 --> 03:17:34.077
LAURA: Just have everybody come in.

4963
03:17:34.077 --> 03:17:38.450
SAM: Beau, are you on this? Do you agree, Caduceus?

4964
03:17:38.450 --> 03:17:39.292
TALIESIN: Hmm?

4965
03:17:39.292 --> 03:17:40.916
SAM: Do you think they should come in?

4966
03:17:40.916 --> 03:17:41.749
TALIESIN: Who?

4967
03:17:41.749 --> 03:17:46.441
SAM: Our friends outside, Caleb and Fjord Tough.

4968
03:17:46.441 --> 03:17:48.699
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I mean, it's always good to see them.

4969
03:17:48.699 --> 03:17:51.784
(laughter)

4970
03:17:51.784 --> 03:17:52.851
SAM: Both of you come in.

4971
03:17:52.851 --> 03:17:55.950
MARISHA: It might be good to have like, stations, you know?

4972
03:17:55.950 --> 03:17:56.783
SAM: What?

4973
03:17:56.783 --> 03:17:59.613
MARISHA: As long as they're in speaking length.

4974
03:17:59.613 --> 03:18:02.951
SAM: One of you stay a little further out,

4975
03:18:02.951 --> 03:18:05.047
or maybe all the way out.

4976
03:18:05.047 --> 03:18:05.973
One of you come in and one of you--

4977
03:18:05.973 --> 03:18:08.032
LAURA: They both get on the roof.

4978
03:18:08.032 --> 03:18:09.375
MARISHA: The buddy system, man!

4979
03:18:09.375 --> 03:18:11.531
LAURA: Both get on the roof and then
one maybe stay on the roof?

4980
03:18:11.531 --> 03:18:13.114
SAM: They're not getting on the roof.

4981
03:18:13.114 --> 03:18:14.435
You can reply to this message.

4982
03:18:14.435 --> 03:18:16.279
(laughter)

4983
03:18:16.279 --> 03:18:17.112
MATT: What are you guys doing?

4984
03:18:17.112 --> 03:18:21.099
LIAM: I silently tug at Fjord's hand

4985
03:18:21.099 --> 03:18:24.437
and pull him back away from the building,

4986
03:18:24.437 --> 03:18:29.437
30 feet, so not quite as close, and send my own message.

4987
03:18:29.491 --> 03:18:31.640
MATT: You do realize that casting Message casts a spell--

4988
03:18:31.640 --> 03:18:32.832
LIAM: Makes it disappear, yeah.

4989
03:18:32.832 --> 03:18:36.001
But is there any structure or anything?

4990
03:18:36.001 --> 03:18:38.011
MATT: You can find a structure, but you'll probably get--

4991
03:18:38.011 --> 03:18:41.255
LIAM: But I'll get out of range.
MATT: -- of Message to do it, yeah.

4992
03:18:41.255 --> 03:18:45.475
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to pull Fjord
a ways away out of sight.

4993
03:18:45.475 --> 03:18:46.308
MATT: Okay.

4994
03:18:47.700 --> 03:18:50.500
TRAVIS: (whispering) We're moving away from the building.

4995
03:18:50.500 --> 03:18:51.966
(laughter)

4996
03:18:51.966 --> 03:18:54.233
LIAM: Okay, without doing anything, I say,

4997
03:18:54.233 --> 03:18:59.176
once we're out of sight: Okay, so they messaged me

4998
03:18:59.176 --> 03:19:02.285
to have both of us to go in, but I'm not sure

4999
03:19:02.285 --> 03:19:03.692
how to get both of us in.

5000
03:19:03.692 --> 03:19:05.817
I know that I can get myself in.

5001
03:19:05.817 --> 03:19:07.461
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, you just go.

5002
03:19:07.461 --> 03:19:09.843
I'll be fine out here invisible.

5003
03:19:09.843 --> 03:19:12.841
How long does this last?

5004
03:19:12.841 --> 03:19:16.871
LIAM: An hour or a couple more seconds when I drop it.

5005
03:19:16.871 --> 03:19:19.270
We're totally blocked from sight?

5006
03:19:19.270 --> 03:19:21.696
MATT: You found a little alcove, yeah.

5007
03:19:21.696 --> 03:19:23.901
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

5008
03:19:23.901 --> 03:19:26.785
I have items and stuff. You just-- you just go.

5009
03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:31.016
MATT: You turn into a bat?
LIAM: Yeah.

5010
03:19:31.016 --> 03:19:32.809
MATT: All right.

5011
03:19:32.809 --> 03:19:34.682
<i>You</i> return to visibility, and are now

5012
03:19:34.682 --> 03:19:37.822
sitting in a small alleyway off near

5013
03:19:37.822 --> 03:19:41.957
one of the estate storage houses, and you're just alone.

5014
03:19:41.957 --> 03:19:43.082
ALL: Aww.

5015
03:19:43.082 --> 03:19:45.224
TRAVIS: Anyone around or looking?

5016
03:19:45.224 --> 03:19:46.459
MATT: At the moment, no.

5017
03:19:46.459 --> 03:19:48.542
It's still early morning.

5018
03:19:50.696 --> 03:19:55.068
TRAVIS: Oh, what a morning for bread, and shopping.

5019
03:19:55.068 --> 03:19:56.561
(whispering) Good luck.

5020
03:19:56.561 --> 03:19:58.294
MATT: Okay, you-- (flitting)

5021
03:19:58.294 --> 03:20:00.348
LIAM: Yeah, and I'm going like: This is very bad day.

5022
03:20:00.348 --> 03:20:01.507
MATT: Roll a stealth check for me.

5023
03:20:01.507 --> 03:20:03.699
LIAM: Bread, bread.
MATT: Using the

5024
03:20:03.699 --> 03:20:05.224
bat's bread stealth.

5025
03:20:05.224 --> 03:20:07.899
LIAM: I never had that stat up, but it was plus--?

5026
03:20:07.899 --> 03:20:09.299
TALIESIN: Eight.
LAURA: No, that's the owl.

5027
03:20:09.299 --> 03:20:11.797
LIAM: One. Just plus one for--?

5028
03:20:11.797 --> 03:20:13.279
LAURA: I'll look.

5029
03:20:13.279 --> 03:20:15.170
LIAM: I'm just going to roll.

5030
03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:16.837
LAURA: Hold on.
LIAM: Pretty okay.

5031
03:20:18.591 --> 03:20:20.735
LAURA: What do you-- it's the dex?
LIAM: Dex, yeah.

5032
03:20:20.735 --> 03:20:21.663
LAURA: Plus two.

5033
03:20:21.663 --> 03:20:22.496
LIAM: 13.

5034
03:20:22.496 --> 03:20:23.763
MATT: 13, okay.

5035
03:20:26.074 --> 03:20:26.907
Okay.

5036
03:20:26.907 --> 03:20:28.967
One of the guards patrolling glances up

5037
03:20:28.967 --> 03:20:31.848
and sees it and is like, notices you,

5038
03:20:31.848 --> 03:20:34.789
but is like ah, fuckin' bat, no big deal.

5039
03:20:34.789 --> 03:20:36.956
You make your way up on the roof,

5040
03:20:36.956 --> 03:20:39.238
and you can see the hole carved there.

5041
03:20:40.797 --> 03:20:41.806
(laughter)

5042
03:20:41.806 --> 03:20:42.639
MATT: All right.

5043
03:20:42.639 --> 03:20:44.789
You guys make your way around the hallway.

5044
03:20:44.789 --> 03:20:46.154
There's the trap on the opposite side,

5045
03:20:46.154 --> 03:20:47.217
there's another door there on the opposite side

5046
03:20:47.217 --> 03:20:50.067
of the hallway, and you can see there is the hatch up there

5047
03:20:50.067 --> 03:20:52.910
and there is a ladder that is beneath it,

5048
03:20:52.910 --> 03:20:54.717
but the hatch is still locked inside.

5049
03:20:54.717 --> 03:20:55.726
TALIESIN: All right.

5050
03:20:55.726 --> 03:20:58.620
But the trap that I was sensing--

5051
03:20:58.620 --> 03:21:00.528
MATT: It's on another chamber beyond the secondary door

5052
03:21:00.528 --> 03:21:01.600
that's on the other side of the hallway.

5053
03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:02.834
TALIESIN: Okay.

5054
03:21:02.834 --> 03:21:06.234
Where's the ring, if you remember?

5055
03:21:07.116 --> 03:21:10.325
LAURA: It's been less than 10 minutes, I'm assuming.

5056
03:21:10.325 --> 03:21:11.886
So yeah, I'd still know where it is.

5057
03:21:11.886 --> 03:21:13.357
SAM: Okay, let's keep going?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5058
03:21:13.357 --> 03:21:15.173
MARISHA: I'm going to keep an ear out, do I hear any--

5059
03:21:15.173 --> 03:21:16.006
MATT: Perception check.

5060
03:21:16.006 --> 03:21:18.006
MARISHA: --sounds, footsteps, presence?

5061
03:21:18.006 --> 03:21:19.652
TALIESIN: I'll join you in that.

5062
03:21:19.652 --> 03:21:22.471
MICA: I also want to put my hamster in front of us,

5063
03:21:22.471 --> 03:21:24.396
so it's going first.

5064
03:21:24.396 --> 03:21:26.313
MARISHA: Five.
TALIESIN: 14.

5065
03:21:26.313 --> 03:21:27.146
MATT: Okay.

5066
03:21:27.146 --> 03:21:28.480
You don't hear anything yet.

5067
03:21:28.480 --> 03:21:31.584
The door is locked, across the way.

5068
03:21:31.584 --> 03:21:33.167
SAM: Oh, jesus.

5069
03:21:33.167 --> 03:21:35.861
Okay, okay, okay.
LAURA: There's no traps?

5070
03:21:35.861 --> 03:21:37.500
TALIESIN: Not on the door, no.

5071
03:21:37.500 --> 03:21:39.474
SAM: All right, all right, all right,

5072
03:21:39.474 --> 03:21:41.031
I'll take another little nip, and then--

5073
03:21:41.031 --> 03:21:43.260
LAURA: Hey, don't drink too much.

5074
03:21:43.260 --> 03:21:44.093
SAM: Okay.

5075
03:21:44.985 --> 03:21:47.554
Then I'll try to pick the lock again.

5076
03:21:47.554 --> 03:21:48.762
26.

5077
03:21:48.762 --> 03:21:50.536
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: (click) (creak)

5078
03:21:50.536 --> 03:21:52.564
SAM: It's just like the other one. I figured it out.

5079
03:21:52.564 --> 03:21:54.329
(laughter)

5080
03:21:54.329 --> 03:21:57.293
MATT: You guys enter what is a small storage chamber.

5081
03:21:57.293 --> 03:22:00.807
You can see there's sheets thrown over old furniture,

5082
03:22:00.807 --> 03:22:03.651
the smell is dusty and musty.

5083
03:22:03.651 --> 03:22:06.791
You can see there is a small desk in the corner,

5084
03:22:06.791 --> 03:22:10.181
a couple of barrels. It's just a general storage room

5085
03:22:10.181 --> 03:22:13.140
that looks to have not seen a whole lot of--

5086
03:22:13.140 --> 03:22:16.653
LAURA: Hidden doors, hidden trap, hidden anything.

5087
03:22:16.653 --> 03:22:18.156
SAM: Well we know where the trap is, right?

5088
03:22:18.156 --> 03:22:19.622
MATT: The path we're leading you to

5089
03:22:19.622 --> 03:22:22.564
is pointing towards a large armoire,

5090
03:22:22.564 --> 03:22:25.766
that itself is, you know, cleaner

5091
03:22:25.766 --> 03:22:27.714
than the rest of the furniture upon glance.

5092
03:22:27.714 --> 03:22:29.011
SAM: Don't open it, don't open it.

5093
03:22:29.011 --> 03:22:30.481
LAURA: Are there traps?
SAM: There's a trap in it.

5094
03:22:30.481 --> 03:22:32.039
LAURA: I was just kidding.

5095
03:22:32.039 --> 03:22:33.111
MATT: As you open the door.

5096
03:22:33.111 --> 03:22:35.432
TALIESIN: No, no, he knew there was a trap.

5097
03:22:35.432 --> 03:22:37.162
MATT: Okay, okay, I'll allow it.

5098
03:22:37.162 --> 03:22:38.523
SAM: I'll shoot her in the throat.

5099
03:22:38.523 --> 03:22:40.314
(laughter)

5100
03:22:40.314 --> 03:22:43.223
TALIESIN: Got to stop solving problems that way.
MATT: Fury of the small!

5101
03:22:43.223 --> 03:22:45.383
(laughter)

5102
03:22:45.383 --> 03:22:46.416
MATT: All right.

5103
03:22:46.416 --> 03:22:47.469
SAM: Don't open it, don't open it.

5104
03:22:47.469 --> 03:22:48.860
LAURA: Why?
SAM: It's got traps.

5105
03:22:48.860 --> 03:22:50.973
LAURA: Oh. Oh, good job, Caduceus.

5106
03:22:50.973 --> 03:22:52.715
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

5107
03:22:52.715 --> 03:22:54.371
SAM: Should I try to disarm it?

5108
03:22:54.371 --> 03:22:55.854
Because if I fail, it'll go off.

5109
03:22:55.854 --> 03:22:57.785
LAURA: Check out the trap and see if it's super hard.

5110
03:22:58.635 --> 03:23:00.888
SAM: I will see if I can locate or identify--

5111
03:23:00.888 --> 03:23:03.759
TALIESIN: Identify the trap first.
SAM: --the type of trap.

5112
03:23:03.759 --> 03:23:05.191
28.

5113
03:23:05.191 --> 03:23:06.812
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Jesus.

5114
03:23:06.812 --> 03:23:10.967
MATT: There is no trap on the doors to the armoire.

5115
03:23:10.967 --> 03:23:12.509
SAM: Go ahead and open it.

5116
03:23:13.418 --> 03:23:14.817
LAURA: Where is the trap, then?

5117
03:23:14.817 --> 03:23:17.515
MATT: It is, however, locked.

5118
03:23:17.515 --> 03:23:20.308
SAM: Oh, fucking shit, balls, shit.

5119
03:23:20.308 --> 03:23:21.360
All right, all right.

5120
03:23:21.360 --> 03:23:23.195
(panting)

5121
03:23:23.195 --> 03:23:25.195
TALIESIN: I'm standing to the side of this thing,

5122
03:23:25.195 --> 03:23:26.437
no matter what happens.

5123
03:23:26.437 --> 03:23:28.083
I'm backing up a bit.

5124
03:23:28.083 --> 03:23:29.339
I believe in you.

5125
03:23:29.339 --> 03:23:31.087
SAM: I'll use my Mage Hand for this one.

5126
03:23:31.087 --> 03:23:32.517
MATT: Okay.

5127
03:23:32.517 --> 03:23:34.833
SAM: Stand back 10 feet, and--

5128
03:23:36.192 --> 03:23:37.258
what am I doing?

5129
03:23:37.258 --> 03:23:38.417
Unlocking it?
MATT: Unlocking, yeah.

5130
03:23:38.417 --> 03:23:39.711
SAM: 29.

5131
03:23:39.711 --> 03:23:40.777
MATT: 29.

5132
03:23:41.781 --> 03:23:43.217
Opens without issue.

5133
03:23:43.217 --> 03:23:46.026
SAM: They've really been using the same lock on all of this.

5134
03:23:46.026 --> 03:23:47.806
The same thing, it's amazing.

5135
03:23:47.806 --> 03:23:49.581
Dumb.

5136
03:23:49.581 --> 03:23:51.983
MATT: Okay, you open it up, and on the inside you can see

5137
03:23:51.983 --> 03:23:54.774
there's six different outfits that have been

5138
03:23:54.774 --> 03:23:57.031
thrown over a central pole,

5139
03:23:57.031 --> 03:24:00.395
so there's just layer after layer of different colored silks

5140
03:24:00.395 --> 03:24:03.768
or different materials.
LAURA: Where's the trap?

5141
03:24:03.768 --> 03:24:07.043
TALIESIN: Can you sense where the ring is still?

5142
03:24:07.043 --> 03:24:09.213
MATT: The trap is further in the armoire.

5143
03:24:09.213 --> 03:24:10.321
TALIESIN: Further in, but the ring, though,

5144
03:24:10.321 --> 03:24:11.154
since you have the ring--

5145
03:24:11.154 --> 03:24:12.503
MATT: Same direction.

5146
03:24:12.503 --> 03:24:13.961
SAM: How much further?

5147
03:24:13.961 --> 03:24:16.180
MARISHA: Is the armoire up against the wall?

5148
03:24:16.180 --> 03:24:17.241
MATT: It is.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5149
03:24:17.241 --> 03:24:18.951
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Oh!

5150
03:24:18.951 --> 03:24:20.071
SAM: It's a door, it's a door.

5151
03:24:20.071 --> 03:24:22.976
TALIESIN and MICA: We found Narnia!
MARISHA: We totally found Narnia!

5152
03:24:22.976 --> 03:24:23.910
MICA: Time to go pet Aslan.

5153
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:25.077
LIAM: Where is Bat-leb, by the way?

5154
03:24:25.077 --> 03:24:29.455
MATT: Now a bat flies into the chamber with you guys.

5155
03:24:29.455 --> 03:24:32.558
You hear (flitting) and you look and you see a bat.

5156
03:24:32.558 --> 03:24:33.906
(gasps)

5157
03:24:33.906 --> 03:24:36.856
LAURA: That's a Caleb bat.

5158
03:24:36.856 --> 03:24:39.140
LIAM: What the hell are we doing? What happened?

5159
03:24:39.140 --> 03:24:43.936
LAURA: ♪ We found a secret passage through an armoire. ♪

5160
03:24:43.936 --> 03:24:45.911
LIAM: Why were you on the balcony?

5161
03:24:45.911 --> 03:24:47.794
SAM: There was a guard that had spotted us,

5162
03:24:47.794 --> 03:24:50.769
so we silenced him.
LAURA: We were saving--

5163
03:24:50.769 --> 03:24:53.160
we were saving everyone, because he was like, "Oh my god,

5164
03:24:53.160 --> 03:24:55.725
I hear people," and he was about to like go and call out,

5165
03:24:55.725 --> 03:24:57.646
and so we--
SAM: We knocked him out.

5166
03:24:57.646 --> 03:25:00.210
LAURA: And tried to knock him out, but Nott accidentally--

5167
03:25:00.210 --> 03:25:02.293
SAM: No, we knocked him out.
LAURA: --murdered the shit out of him.

5168
03:25:02.293 --> 03:25:03.713
SAM: Oh, she's going to--

5169
03:25:03.713 --> 03:25:07.392
LAURA: She didn't mean to. We didn't mean to kill him.

5170
03:25:07.392 --> 03:25:11.270
We were only going to make him quiet, and then he died.

5171
03:25:11.270 --> 03:25:14.082
SAM: His head partially fell off.

5172
03:25:14.082 --> 03:25:16.057
LAURA: But it was an accident!

5173
03:25:16.057 --> 03:25:17.641
We're still good people.

5174
03:25:17.641 --> 03:25:19.324
SAM: If you're going to kill me, can you just wait

5175
03:25:19.324 --> 03:25:21.666
until we leave first, and then you can kill me?

5176
03:25:21.666 --> 03:25:23.662
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5177
03:25:23.662 --> 03:25:24.723
Wait.

5178
03:25:24.723 --> 03:25:25.556
Wait.
MATT: Wait.

5179
03:25:25.556 --> 03:25:27.005
TALIESIN: Wait.
LAURA: Wait.

5180
03:25:27.005 --> 03:25:28.436
LIAM: Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah?

5181
03:25:28.436 --> 03:25:30.702
LIAM: What is going on?

5182
03:25:32.166 --> 03:25:34.116
TALIESIN: We found a--

5183
03:25:34.116 --> 03:25:36.381
we found a magic closet.

5184
03:25:36.381 --> 03:25:38.183
I don't know anything beyond that.

5185
03:25:38.183 --> 03:25:39.707
LAURA: We can't wait too long, because my Locate Object

5186
03:25:39.707 --> 03:25:41.143
only lasts for 10 minutes.

5187
03:25:41.143 --> 03:25:42.487
LIAM: I cast Detect Magic.

5188
03:25:42.487 --> 03:25:44.070
MATT: Okay.

5189
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:48.095
You detect-- the range on that is?

5190
03:25:48.095 --> 03:25:49.484
LIAM: 30 I think, 30.

5191
03:25:49.484 --> 03:25:50.655
MATT: 30 feet?

5192
03:25:50.655 --> 03:25:52.937
You sense a faint bit of magic

5193
03:25:52.937 --> 03:25:54.444
towards the back of this closet.

5194
03:25:54.444 --> 03:25:55.278
LIAM: What kind?

5195
03:25:55.278 --> 03:25:57.178
MATT: This would be...

5196
03:25:57.178 --> 03:25:58.303
necromantic.

5197
03:25:58.303 --> 03:26:00.046
SAM: Oh.
MARISHA: Ooh.

5198
03:26:01.228 --> 03:26:04.028
LIAM: That's bad armoire.

5199
03:26:04.028 --> 03:26:08.836
(laughter)

5200
03:26:11.176 --> 03:26:12.811
TALIESIN: Everyone's on fire tonight, man.

5201
03:26:12.811 --> 03:26:17.611
(laughter)

5202
03:26:17.611 --> 03:26:21.874
(laughter continues)

5203
03:26:21.874 --> 03:26:22.996
TALIESIN: Good to have you back.

5204
03:26:22.996 --> 03:26:24.217
MICA: It certainly is.

5205
03:26:24.217 --> 03:26:26.657
(laughter)

5206
03:26:26.657 --> 03:26:29.279
LIAM: I quickly, rapidly look all around the room.

5207
03:26:29.279 --> 03:26:32.134
Is there anything else besides the necromantic armoire?

5208
03:26:32.134 --> 03:26:33.068
MATT: Nope.

5209
03:26:33.068 --> 03:26:34.504
MARISHA: Do I see any signs--

5210
03:26:34.504 --> 03:26:36.798
LIAM: I cast Dispel Magic in its direction.

5211
03:26:36.798 --> 03:26:38.913
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

5212
03:26:38.913 --> 03:26:41.665
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20 and add

5213
03:26:41.665 --> 03:26:43.068
your intelligence modifier.
LIAM: My what now?

5214
03:26:43.068 --> 03:26:45.818
MATT: Add your intelligence modifier.

5215
03:26:48.035 --> 03:26:49.931
LIAM: 23.
SAM: Ooh, good.

5216
03:26:49.931 --> 03:26:51.834
MATT: You sense the magic fade.

5217
03:26:51.834 --> 03:26:52.667
SAM: (sighs)

5218
03:26:52.667 --> 03:26:55.144
LAURA: What-- how do you know that it was good that you--

5219
03:26:55.144 --> 03:26:57.537
LIAM: Now it's a good armoire, okay.

5220
03:26:57.537 --> 03:27:00.225
MARISHA: Do you think it was going to eat our face off?

5221
03:27:00.225 --> 03:27:02.044
I bet it was going to eat our face.

5222
03:27:02.044 --> 03:27:04.424
TALIESIN: I would have to cast it again, but I can find out.

5223
03:27:04.424 --> 03:27:05.636
LAURA: The trap is still there?

5224
03:27:05.636 --> 03:27:06.731
SAM: Well we don't know, actually.

5225
03:27:06.731 --> 03:27:08.701
MATT: You don't know, are you casting it again?

5226
03:27:08.701 --> 03:27:10.129
TALIESIN: What level is that?
MATT: Second level.

5227
03:27:10.129 --> 03:27:11.855
TALIESIN: Sure, I'll cast it again.

5228
03:27:11.855 --> 03:27:13.227
MATT: Okay, the trap is no longer there,

5229
03:27:13.227 --> 03:27:15.982
but you now sense five other traps

5230
03:27:15.982 --> 03:27:18.824
roughly about 80 feet ahead of you.

5231
03:27:18.824 --> 03:27:20.569
TALIESIN: There are five other traps roughly 80 feet ahead--

5232
03:27:20.569 --> 03:27:22.028
MATT: In the same direction that you're in.

5233
03:27:22.028 --> 03:27:23.038
TALIESIN: --in the direction that we're going.

5234
03:27:23.038 --> 03:27:23.996
SAM: Into the armoire?
TALIESIN: Yep.

5235
03:27:23.996 --> 03:27:25.319
SAM: All right.
LAURA: Let's do it.

5236
03:27:25.319 --> 03:27:26.915
MARISHA: Where did you leave Fjord?

5237
03:27:26.915 --> 03:27:29.606
LIAM: He's a ways away from the street.

5238
03:27:29.606 --> 03:27:30.941
We wanted to both come in but--

5239
03:27:30.941 --> 03:27:32.014
LAURA: What are the clothes hanging in there?

5240
03:27:32.014 --> 03:27:33.184
Are they cool at all?

5241
03:27:33.184 --> 03:27:34.259
MATT: They're pretty nice robes.

5242
03:27:34.259 --> 03:27:36.228
LAURA: Whoa, look at these pretty robes.

5243
03:27:36.228 --> 03:27:37.087
SAM: Just grab it.

5244
03:27:37.087 --> 03:27:39.143
LAURA: I just pull one and put it on.

5245
03:27:39.143 --> 03:27:40.643
SAM: Because they're bad people.
MARISHA: Do I see any sign

5246
03:27:40.643 --> 03:27:42.143
of shit that looks like it was

5247
03:27:42.143 --> 03:27:47.143
smuggled or illicit substances, or signs--

5248
03:27:47.388 --> 03:27:49.706
MATT: You can start to tear through the room if you want.

5249
03:27:49.706 --> 03:27:51.176
I mean, everything here looks furniture-like,

5250
03:27:51.176 --> 03:27:53.483
but you can begin to do a more--
SAM: Let's stay on task.

5251
03:27:53.483 --> 03:27:55.714
TALIESIN: There's obviously better stuff this way.

5252
03:27:55.714 --> 03:27:57.261
LAURA: I've only got 10 minutes for my spell.

5253
03:27:57.261 --> 03:27:59.130
MICA: Also, as we go in, they keep saying,

5254
03:27:59.130 --> 03:28:00.584
you know, because they're bad people.

5255
03:28:00.584 --> 03:28:04.855
I pat Nott and I go, slavery is very bad.

5256
03:28:04.855 --> 03:28:06.986
(strained) I'm sure it's fine.

5257
03:28:06.986 --> 03:28:09.118
Then I just keep walking.
MATT: Okay.

5258
03:28:09.118 --> 03:28:11.599
SAM: If she tries to kill me, will you protect me?

5259
03:28:11.599 --> 03:28:13.954
LAURA: I'll really talk you up, okay?

5260
03:28:13.954 --> 03:28:15.300
(laughter)

5261
03:28:15.300 --> 03:28:16.965
SAM: You'll "talk me up"?

5262
03:28:16.965 --> 03:28:20.306
(laughter)

5263
03:28:22.282 --> 03:28:23.917
LIAM: Having seen the trap that is in this room,

5264
03:28:23.917 --> 03:28:25.648
and there's a lot of people working,

5265
03:28:25.648 --> 03:28:27.586
I would like to sort of investigate the room

5266
03:28:27.586 --> 03:28:31.686
to try to figure out who lives here that they had that.

5267
03:28:31.686 --> 03:28:33.117
MATT: Okay.
SAM: The bedroom?

5268
03:28:33.117 --> 03:28:34.504
MATT: Make an investigation check.

5269
03:28:34.504 --> 03:28:36.271
MARISHA: Wait, you're staying behind and looking?

5270
03:28:36.271 --> 03:28:38.044
LIAM: People are at work.

5271
03:28:38.044 --> 03:28:40.070
SAM: We're going to go in.

5272
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:41.403
TALIESIN: We have to open the lock

5273
03:28:41.403 --> 03:28:44.304
that's behind the armoire.
LIAM: That's a 16.

5274
03:28:44.304 --> 03:28:45.854
MATT: 16, okay, so you start looking through.

5275
03:28:45.854 --> 03:28:46.921
What are you guys doing?
SAM: Is there a lock?

5276
03:28:46.921 --> 03:28:49.056
MATT: It's going to take you a while to do that.

5277
03:28:49.056 --> 03:28:50.195
There is a lock on the back door.

5278
03:28:50.195 --> 03:28:52.020
SAM: Jesus.
MICA: That's a fucking lot of locks.

5279
03:28:52.020 --> 03:28:53.341
SAM: All right, one more time, one more time.

5280
03:28:53.341 --> 03:28:55.850
MATT: Yes, I wonder what they're guarding.

5281
03:28:55.850 --> 03:28:57.891
SAM: Going to take another little nip of booze.

5282
03:28:57.891 --> 03:29:00.558
LAURA: Don't drink too much.
SAM: Don't worry, I'm okay.

5283
03:29:02.113 --> 03:29:03.365
20.

5284
03:29:03.365 --> 03:29:04.250
MATT: 20.

5285
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:06.609
You just barely manage to find a bit--

5286
03:29:06.609 --> 03:29:09.890
This is a larger keyhole, and as such, there's more distance

5287
03:29:09.890 --> 03:29:12.043
between where the tumblers usually hit,

5288
03:29:12.043 --> 03:29:14.114
and there's a weird spring mechanism on the inside

5289
03:29:14.114 --> 03:29:16.506
that you're afraid might have been attached

5290
03:29:16.506 --> 03:29:17.737
to that earlier trap, or at least

5291
03:29:17.737 --> 03:29:20.510
what would have triggered it, but you manage

5292
03:29:20.510 --> 03:29:22.565
to just get it to turn slightly enough

5293
03:29:22.565 --> 03:29:27.254
where the latch scrapes open and it opens up to a hallway.

5294
03:29:27.254 --> 03:29:30.060
You have to step through, and it's a bit uncomfortable

5295
03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:31.970
for like, a taller person to get through.

5296
03:29:31.970 --> 03:29:36.127
This seems to be designed for a smaller or lithe individual,

5297
03:29:36.127 --> 03:29:39.136
but there is a hallway beyond, lightless.

5298
03:29:40.492 --> 03:29:42.539
LAURA: Can we hear anything down the hallway?

5299
03:29:42.539 --> 03:29:43.861
MATT: Make a perception check.

5300
03:29:43.861 --> 03:29:46.056
TALIESIN: I'll join you in that.

5301
03:29:46.056 --> 03:29:46.889
TALIESIN: (sighs)

5302
03:29:46.889 --> 03:29:47.722
LAURA: I know, right?

5303
03:29:47.722 --> 03:29:48.555
TALIESIN: 16.

5304
03:29:48.555 --> 03:29:49.621
LAURA: 10.

5305
03:29:49.621 --> 03:29:50.717
MATT: You don't hear anything.

5306
03:29:50.717 --> 03:29:54.058
MICA: I want to send my gerbil hamster,

5307
03:29:54.058 --> 03:29:55.574
whomst I've named Henry.

5308
03:29:55.574 --> 03:29:56.598
TALIESIN: Henry the hamster.

5309
03:29:56.598 --> 03:29:59.298
MICA: Henry the hamster, down the hall first.

5310
03:29:59.298 --> 03:30:00.639
MATT: (scampering noises)

5311
03:30:00.639 --> 03:30:01.829
TALIESIN: But not too far.

5312
03:30:01.829 --> 03:30:03.626
MICA: Not too far, not too far, just like

5313
03:30:03.626 --> 03:30:05.081
a little bit of recon, yeah, 50 feet or so.

5314
03:30:05.081 --> 03:30:08.552
MATT: Okay, goes out 50 feet and stops and turns around.

5315
03:30:08.552 --> 03:30:11.269
MICA: Do I still have talk with animals up?

5316
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:14.083
MATT: No, it would've faded. That was yesterday.

5317
03:30:14.083 --> 03:30:15.392
MICA: All right, I'll cast it again.

5318
03:30:15.392 --> 03:30:16.225
MATT: Okay.

5319
03:30:18.219 --> 03:30:20.136
MICA: Did you see anything?

5320
03:30:22.251 --> 03:30:23.309
MATT: "No."

5321
03:30:23.309 --> 03:30:25.309
MICA: Did you hear anything?

5322
03:30:26.468 --> 03:30:27.301
MATT: "No."

5323
03:30:28.234 --> 03:30:30.891
(laughter)

5324
03:30:30.891 --> 03:30:33.499
SAM: What a snooty hamster.

5325
03:30:33.499 --> 03:30:36.721
MICA: Are you ready in case we need you again?

5326
03:30:36.721 --> 03:30:38.271
MATT: "Mm, yeah."
MICA: Okay.

5327
03:30:38.271 --> 03:30:40.217
(laughter)

5328
03:30:40.217 --> 03:30:42.540
MICA: That was my recon.

5329
03:30:42.540 --> 03:30:44.341
TALIESIN: I'm going in blind, I guess.

5330
03:30:44.341 --> 03:30:45.987
Let these people go ahead of me.

5331
03:30:45.987 --> 03:30:47.898
MATT: You guys are going in the darkness?

5332
03:30:47.898 --> 03:30:49.730
TALIESIN: Just for the moment.

5333
03:30:49.730 --> 03:30:51.213
I trust you guys.

5334
03:30:51.213 --> 03:30:53.459
SAM: We're just going to keep going ahead?

5335
03:30:53.459 --> 03:30:55.053
MATT: What's the marching order here?

5336
03:30:55.053 --> 03:30:56.437
TALIESIN: I'm in the middle.

5337
03:30:56.437 --> 03:30:58.045
LAURA: Nott should be in the front.
SAM: I'll go first.

5338
03:30:58.045 --> 03:30:59.287
LAURA: I'll go behind Nott.

5339
03:30:59.287 --> 03:31:00.980
MATT: Nott's in the front, followed by Jester.

5340
03:31:00.980 --> 03:31:02.638
TALIESIN: Then me.
MARISHA: And I'll take the rear.

5341
03:31:02.638 --> 03:31:05.921
MATT: All right, with--
LAURA: Caleb and Reani?

5342
03:31:05.921 --> 03:31:08.049
MATT: Caleb and Reani and then Beau?

5343
03:31:08.049 --> 03:31:09.960
SAM: Whoa, look at Reani's miniature.

5344
03:31:09.960 --> 03:31:11.291
MICA: Yeah!

5345
03:31:11.291 --> 03:31:12.924
LAURA: Oh, it wasn't here last week.

5346
03:31:12.924 --> 03:31:16.284
SAM: As we walk I'm going to cast Message to Fjord

5347
03:31:16.284 --> 03:31:19.107
and I'm just going to tell Fjord, listen,

5348
03:31:19.107 --> 03:31:22.418
we're going deeper in, out of communication range,

5349
03:31:22.418 --> 03:31:25.206
but if you see those front guards notice

5350
03:31:25.206 --> 03:31:29.542
their fallen compatriot on the third floor,

5351
03:31:29.542 --> 03:31:30.866
keep them distracted.

5352
03:31:30.866 --> 03:31:32.213
MATT: You're too far. You don't hear anything.

5353
03:31:32.213 --> 03:31:33.371
TRAVIS: I figured.

5354
03:31:33.371 --> 03:31:34.643
(laughter)

5355
03:31:34.643 --> 03:31:37.424
SAM: He's so stoic.
LAURA: He is.

5356
03:31:37.424 --> 03:31:38.697
MATT: All right.

5357
03:31:38.697 --> 03:31:40.015
MICA: This is going great, you guys.

5358
03:31:40.015 --> 03:31:41.624
MATT: So you guys continue in to the dark hallway.

5359
03:31:41.624 --> 03:31:43.229
LAURA: Should we send some lights or something?

5360
03:31:43.229 --> 03:31:45.501
MATT: No sight, no sight.

5361
03:31:45.501 --> 03:31:47.295
You're still perusing through, okay.

5362
03:31:47.295 --> 03:31:48.754
MARISHA: I've got goggles.

5363
03:31:48.754 --> 03:31:49.752
MICA: Do I see anything with darkvision?

5364
03:31:49.752 --> 03:31:51.509
MATT: The people with darkvision, you can see fine,

5365
03:31:51.509 --> 03:31:53.142
but just you have one member of your team,

5366
03:31:53.142 --> 03:31:55.374
with Caleb staying behind, and you have almost

5367
03:31:55.374 --> 03:31:57.044
no light in here in this chamber either,

5368
03:31:57.044 --> 03:31:59.301
so you're fumbling in the dark.

5369
03:31:59.301 --> 03:32:01.083
LIAM: I'll blow some transmutation magic

5370
03:32:01.083 --> 03:32:02.409
and give myself darkvision, then,

5371
03:32:02.409 --> 03:32:04.809
from the transmutation stone.
MATT: You got it, okay.

5372
03:32:04.809 --> 03:32:06.267
Continuing though the hall,

5373
03:32:06.267 --> 03:32:10.933
20, 40, 60 or so feet.

5374
03:32:10.933 --> 03:32:15.774
You watch the hallway open into a chamber,

5375
03:32:15.774 --> 03:32:18.738
and as you make a step, suddenly the chamber lights up.

5376
03:32:18.738 --> 03:32:19.571
(gasping)

5377
03:32:19.571 --> 03:32:21.829
A globe in the center of the ceiling, affixed to it,

5378
03:32:21.829 --> 03:32:26.739
warms, and this light fills the chamber.

5379
03:32:26.739 --> 03:32:30.014
You stand at the precipice of a pentagon-shaped room

5380
03:32:30.014 --> 03:32:33.043
with five sides.
SAM: Always a good sign.

5381
03:32:33.043 --> 03:32:34.637
TALIESIN: Right, lots of traps.

5382
03:32:34.637 --> 03:32:36.398
LAURA: Where's that trap, where's that trap?

5383
03:32:37.373 --> 03:32:40.647
MATT: As you look in the middle of this pentagram-like

5384
03:32:40.647 --> 03:32:45.580
chamber, each corner about 30 feet from each other,

5385
03:32:45.580 --> 03:32:49.098
end to end. You can see in the center of each of these walls

5386
03:32:49.098 --> 03:32:51.731
there is a

5387
03:32:51.731 --> 03:32:55.264
metallic case made of dark,

5388
03:32:55.264 --> 03:32:59.055
gun-metal iron with a

5389
03:32:59.055 --> 03:33:01.930
glass cage on top of it,

5390
03:33:01.930 --> 03:33:04.473
set like a display.

5391
03:33:04.473 --> 03:33:06.898
And there's one at each wall.

5392
03:33:06.898 --> 03:33:08.252
LAURA: (gasps)

5393
03:33:08.252 --> 03:33:10.390
SAM: So there's five total?
MATT: There are five.

5394
03:33:10.390 --> 03:33:11.740
LAURA: And there's traps on each one?

5395
03:33:11.740 --> 03:33:13.280
MATT: There's a trap on each one.

5396
03:33:13.280 --> 03:33:14.759
SAM: Is there anything in the middle?

5397
03:33:14.759 --> 03:33:16.136
MATT: There's nothing in the center.

5398
03:33:16.136 --> 03:33:17.441
It's just that orb giving the light.

5399
03:33:17.441 --> 03:33:19.799
LIAM: So it's like the mineral room at the museum?

5400
03:33:19.799 --> 03:33:21.206
MATT: Kind of.
LIAM: Glass box, glass box.

5401
03:33:21.206 --> 03:33:22.558
That's the best room at the museum.

5402
03:33:22.558 --> 03:33:24.571
MICA: And there's no trap in the middle?

5403
03:33:24.571 --> 03:33:26.198
MATT: That you've sensed.

5404
03:33:26.198 --> 03:33:27.658
TALIESIN: That I sense.

5405
03:33:27.658 --> 03:33:31.354
MARISHA: Do you still sense the ring? Is it in here?

5406
03:33:31.354 --> 03:33:33.822
LAURA: Yeah, it's--

5407
03:33:33.822 --> 03:33:35.182
SAM: Oh yeah, is your spell working?

5408
03:33:35.182 --> 03:33:37.048
MATT: I'd say you'd be on the very very end cusp,

5409
03:33:37.048 --> 03:33:40.860
but yes, there is a box adjacent to where you enter

5410
03:33:40.860 --> 03:33:45.018
to the left that you sense is probably where the ring is.

5411
03:33:45.018 --> 03:33:47.426
SAM: That's clutch, by the way.

5412
03:33:47.426 --> 03:33:48.736
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

5413
03:33:48.736 --> 03:33:50.243
SAM: All right, let's go over to it.

5414
03:33:50.243 --> 03:33:52.511
MATT: Okay, you walk up, and you can see--

5415
03:33:52.511 --> 03:33:55.031
all the cases are identical, though in different sizes.

5416
03:33:55.031 --> 03:33:59.016
This one is a little thinner, and as you look across it,

5417
03:33:59.016 --> 03:34:02.525
the glass top of it what has an iron cage

5418
03:34:02.525 --> 03:34:05.242
based across it, light from the orb allows you to see,

5419
03:34:05.242 --> 03:34:09.637
there is a faint silver velvet pillow,

5420
03:34:09.637 --> 03:34:12.622
and on it you can see the ring resting on it,

5421
03:34:12.622 --> 03:34:14.605
like a display case.

5422
03:34:14.605 --> 03:34:16.950
You gather this is a collection of some kind.

5423
03:34:16.950 --> 03:34:19.717
A hidden vault that contains a collection.

5424
03:34:19.717 --> 03:34:22.639
The ring you recognize as having the same

5425
03:34:22.639 --> 03:34:25.448
spiraling red metal around the entirety of its band,

5426
03:34:25.448 --> 03:34:29.565
very faint elven filigree along the spiral,

5427
03:34:29.565 --> 03:34:31.226
and you can see in the middle of it

5428
03:34:31.226 --> 03:34:34.232
a polished oval stone of jet.

5429
03:34:34.232 --> 03:34:37.360
This very much matches the description you were given.

5430
03:34:37.360 --> 03:34:39.738
LAURA: This is the ring.
SAM: Okay.

5431
03:34:39.738 --> 03:34:42.357
MARISHA: While they handle that--

5432
03:34:42.357 --> 03:34:45.220
SAM: (cooing) Wizard. Are you here?

5433
03:34:45.220 --> 03:34:46.758
Oh, you're not in the room with us.

5434
03:34:46.758 --> 03:34:48.454
MATT: You by the way, you're investigating in the dark--

5435
03:34:48.454 --> 03:34:49.937
LIAM: I'm busy.

5436
03:34:49.937 --> 03:34:54.375
MATT: Looking through, it's pretty much just empty storage.

5437
03:34:54.375 --> 03:34:56.420
Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

5438
03:34:56.420 --> 03:35:00.568
Okay, I will abandon it and gingerly make my way

5439
03:35:00.568 --> 03:35:03.440
into this room, this sex dungeon where they are, clearly.

5440
03:35:03.440 --> 03:35:04.462
MATT: Okay.

5441
03:35:04.462 --> 03:35:06.605
Well, right this way, Mr. Gray.

5442
03:35:06.605 --> 03:35:08.803
(laughter)

5443
03:35:08.803 --> 03:35:09.712
LAURA: Oh no.

5444
03:35:09.712 --> 03:35:10.870
MARISHA: Look at the other cases.

5445
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:11.905
MATT: Okay.

5446
03:35:11.905 --> 03:35:16.572
You walk by. The next chamber you come across has--

5447
03:35:17.623 --> 03:35:21.398
Okay. This one has what looks to be a

5448
03:35:22.814 --> 03:35:25.321
a leather-wrapped,

5449
03:35:25.321 --> 03:35:30.321
thick bulbous vial with a stopper cork on the top of it.

5450
03:35:30.631 --> 03:35:33.237
It's almost like a quick-silver type liquid

5451
03:35:33.237 --> 03:35:36.915
that rests inside that reflects what light makes its way

5452
03:35:36.915 --> 03:35:41.654
to the display case to where it looks like liquid silver.

5453
03:35:41.654 --> 03:35:44.455
The next one you walk past is an old book,

5454
03:35:44.455 --> 03:35:47.695
maybe about that big, end to end.

5455
03:35:47.695 --> 03:35:51.605
There's no title on it. It's leather.

5456
03:35:51.605 --> 03:35:54.583
There is some intricate design put towards--

5457
03:35:54.583 --> 03:35:56.602
it's like a brownish-red color.

5458
03:35:57.560 --> 03:36:00.006
And that just sits in another element.

5459
03:36:00.006 --> 03:36:02.810
The next one is a similar size to the first one you found

5460
03:36:02.810 --> 03:36:04.531
and there is another ring.

5461
03:36:04.531 --> 03:36:07.211
This band looks like it's made of silver

5462
03:36:07.211 --> 03:36:10.674
with a little bit of a gold line down the center,

5463
03:36:10.674 --> 03:36:13.517
and there are runes across the top of the ridge

5464
03:36:13.517 --> 03:36:15.114
and the bottom of the ridge as well.

5465
03:36:15.114 --> 03:36:16.862
It's beautiful and it's just resting there

5466
03:36:16.862 --> 03:36:20.207
on its own pillow, similar color velvet beneath it.

5467
03:36:20.207 --> 03:36:23.065
Then the last one of the five,

5468
03:36:23.065 --> 03:36:25.032
you see a wand,

5469
03:36:25.032 --> 03:36:30.026
about that long, of beautifully carved rosewood.

5470
03:36:30.026 --> 03:36:32.575
Along it you can see all sorts of runes

5471
03:36:32.575 --> 03:36:34.656
that spiral and then reverse, spiral and then reverse,

5472
03:36:34.656 --> 03:36:35.739
spiral again.

5473
03:36:36.862 --> 03:36:39.770
The coloration of the wood seems to shift about halfway up

5474
03:36:39.770 --> 03:36:43.110
from the rosewood to a dull blue to a purple

5475
03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:44.769
and then back to the rosewood again.

5476
03:36:44.769 --> 03:36:46.786
It's beautiful.

5477
03:36:48.668 --> 03:36:50.913
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Detect Magic in this room.

5478
03:36:50.913 --> 03:36:52.036
MATT: All right.

5479
03:36:52.036 --> 03:36:56.823
You immediately sense multiple magical sources very strongly

5480
03:36:56.823 --> 03:36:59.566
from each of these five cases.

5481
03:36:59.566 --> 03:37:02.999
TALIESIN: The cases themselves as well, though?

5482
03:37:02.999 --> 03:37:05.687
MATT: You detect strong magical essence

5483
03:37:05.687 --> 03:37:08.428
from each of these cases, and the space.

5484
03:37:08.428 --> 03:37:10.776
It could be a combination of the items and the traps.

5485
03:37:10.776 --> 03:37:13.035
You do get the sense that the types of magic

5486
03:37:13.035 --> 03:37:14.797
you get from these, so--

5487
03:37:14.797 --> 03:37:16.123
TALIESIN: Would I know that?

5488
03:37:16.123 --> 03:37:18.269
MATT: As part of Detect Magic, you do learn the schools

5489
03:37:18.269 --> 03:37:20.918
of it, and you do sense that the traps themselves

5490
03:37:20.918 --> 03:37:24.727
are also magical.
TALIESIN: Sure, magic traps.

5491
03:37:24.727 --> 03:37:26.702
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Magic traps.

5492
03:37:28.302 --> 03:37:30.241
MATT: There is a heavy enchantment sense

5493
03:37:30.241 --> 03:37:33.102
from each of these stations, and then--

5494
03:37:33.102 --> 03:37:34.352
TALIESIN: All enchanted.

5495
03:37:34.352 --> 03:37:37.578
MATT: The one that you guys are looking at here

5496
03:37:37.578 --> 03:37:42.078
with the ring is a very strong enchantment-based aura.

5497
03:37:43.067 --> 03:37:47.592
The book has a...

5498
03:37:47.592 --> 03:37:49.767
strong transmutation element to it.

5499
03:37:49.767 --> 03:37:51.805
TALIESIN: The book's giving off the changy thing.

5500
03:37:51.805 --> 03:37:53.313
LIAM: Caleb is already standing front of it.

5501
03:37:53.313 --> 03:37:55.321
TALIESIN: I figured you'd want to know.

5502
03:37:55.321 --> 03:37:57.496
MATT: The wand has--

5503
03:37:58.704 --> 03:38:01.279
it's hard to pick up.

5504
03:38:01.279 --> 03:38:03.375
It seems to shift in the moment.

5505
03:38:03.375 --> 03:38:04.909
TALIESIN: It's a very weird stick.

5506
03:38:04.909 --> 03:38:07.291
MATT: Like a kaleidoscope of different schools

5507
03:38:07.291 --> 03:38:08.958
constantly rotating.

5508
03:38:10.586 --> 03:38:14.452
The silver ring has a--

5509
03:38:15.786 --> 03:38:19.283
an abjuration-based essence to it.

5510
03:38:19.283 --> 03:38:20.968
TALIESIN: Abjuration vibe on the silver ring, all right.

5511
03:38:20.968 --> 03:38:25.960
MATT: Yes, and the quicksilver-like oil in the container,

5512
03:38:27.650 --> 03:38:29.466
that would have a...

5513
03:38:31.041 --> 03:38:33.165
it would have an enchantment base as well.

5514
03:38:33.165 --> 03:38:36.380
TALIESIN: That's just some sort of weird
motor oil, I don't know.

5515
03:38:36.380 --> 03:38:37.733
Enchantment-based.

5516
03:38:37.733 --> 03:38:38.958
I relay all this.

5517
03:38:38.958 --> 03:38:41.464
LIAM: Caduceus, the cases themselves--

5518
03:38:41.464 --> 03:38:43.584
TALIESIN: Are all enchanted.
LIAM: Are enchanted.

5519
03:38:43.584 --> 03:38:47.901
TALIESIN: The big one is-- it's giving quite a glow.

5520
03:38:49.151 --> 03:38:51.152
LIAM: I have not left the book.

5521
03:38:52.060 --> 03:38:54.035
TRAVIS: How far are those cases from each other

5522
03:38:54.035 --> 03:38:55.826
just for context?

5523
03:38:55.826 --> 03:39:00.004
MATT: They're about 10, 15 feet from each other,

5524
03:39:00.004 --> 03:39:04.440
and they're about 30 feet across from the other ones.

5525
03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:07.047
Imagine the five-pointed star. They're all kind of

5526
03:39:07.047 --> 03:39:09.090
equidistant from each other within the chamber.

5527
03:39:09.090 --> 03:39:10.238
LIAM: Not that big a room.

5528
03:39:10.238 --> 03:39:11.822
A room about this big, probably.

5529
03:39:11.822 --> 03:39:14.770
MATT: Roughly. A little bit bigger than this.

5530
03:39:14.770 --> 03:39:16.661
MICA: Pinky?
TALIESIN: Hmm, yeah?

5531
03:39:16.661 --> 03:39:19.202
MICA: If bad people have these things,

5532
03:39:19.202 --> 03:39:20.868
would that be bad?

5533
03:39:20.868 --> 03:39:23.690
TALIESIN: I think-- I think it would be.

5534
03:39:23.690 --> 03:39:27.144
I get the feeling this is-- I have an urge to set a fire

5535
03:39:27.144 --> 03:39:29.414
on the way out, honestly.

5536
03:39:29.414 --> 03:39:31.964
MARISHA: Yeah, can I-- oh, go ahead.

5537
03:39:31.964 --> 03:39:36.156
MICA: (stuttering) Sh-sh-should (inhale)

5538
03:39:36.156 --> 03:39:41.131
Should we make sure bad people don't have bad things?

5539
03:39:42.358 --> 03:39:43.899
TALIESIN: I think we have to be careful

5540
03:39:43.899 --> 03:39:46.581
to take care of ourselves first, but--

5541
03:39:46.581 --> 03:39:48.661
MICA: Okay, but what if we need to save other people,

5542
03:39:48.661 --> 03:39:50.861
because what if this could hurt other people?

5543
03:39:50.861 --> 03:39:53.286
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think we should possibly--

5544
03:39:53.286 --> 03:39:54.561
what was the word?

5545
03:39:54.561 --> 03:39:57.701
Liberate some of this.
MICA: Yeah, okay.

5546
03:39:57.701 --> 03:39:58.867
Okay.

5547
03:39:58.867 --> 03:40:00.781
TALIESIN: I'm going to check-- I want to check the entrance

5548
03:40:00.781 --> 03:40:02.916
to this room.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5549
03:40:02.916 --> 03:40:06.082
TALIESIN: Is there some sort of locking mechanism

5550
03:40:06.082 --> 03:40:07.983
that if something gets triggered,

5551
03:40:07.983 --> 03:40:09.273
is the room going to get sealed?

5552
03:40:09.273 --> 03:40:10.525
MATT: Make an investigation check.

5553
03:40:10.525 --> 03:40:12.074
TALIESIN: Why investigation, man?

5554
03:40:12.074 --> 03:40:14.622
MATT: Because this is exactly what you need to do--
TALIESIN: I know.

5555
03:40:14.622 --> 03:40:16.520
MATT: --to try and figure out these type of mechanisms.

5556
03:40:16.520 --> 03:40:18.229
TALIESIN: Oh, that's good.

5557
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:19.736
Uh, one.

5558
03:40:19.736 --> 03:40:21.738
(laughter)

5559
03:40:21.738 --> 03:40:23.712
I rolled a two minus one.

5560
03:40:23.712 --> 03:40:25.112
MATT: You, um--

5561
03:40:27.747 --> 03:40:30.427
Like, you've been around doors most of your life.

5562
03:40:30.427 --> 03:40:33.538
TALIESIN: I mean, really I haven't,
though, I really haven't.

5563
03:40:33.538 --> 03:40:35.782
MATT: Well, entrance-ways.
TALIESIN: Sure.

5564
03:40:35.782 --> 03:40:39.586
MATT: Egresses, there have been passages.

5565
03:40:39.586 --> 03:40:40.866
TALIESIN: There have been a few.

5566
03:40:40.866 --> 03:40:43.425
MATT: You're really unable to figure out

5567
03:40:43.425 --> 03:40:44.790
if there's anything special about this one.

5568
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:45.990
TALIESIN: Oh man, I don't know.

5569
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:48.971
LIAM: When you were putting the blacklight on this room,

5570
03:40:48.971 --> 03:40:51.560
did you see anything besides these cases?

5571
03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:53.379
TALIESIN: The stuff in them, the cases.

5572
03:40:53.379 --> 03:40:54.301
LIAM: The cases and what's in them.

5573
03:40:54.301 --> 03:40:55.595
Nothing on the ceiling, nothing--

5574
03:40:55.595 --> 03:40:58.750
MATT: There would be a faint magical essence

5575
03:40:58.750 --> 03:41:00.251
from the glow of the orb in the center.

5576
03:41:00.251 --> 03:41:02.155
TALIESIN: But nothing else, really.
MATT: No.

5577
03:41:02.155 --> 03:41:05.857
MARISHA: Is there any type of script or coding

5578
03:41:05.857 --> 03:41:07.475
or anything on the walls?
LIAM: Yeah, on doorways,

5579
03:41:07.475 --> 03:41:09.458
or patterns, or writing,

5580
03:41:09.458 --> 03:41:11.727
aside from these museum cases?

5581
03:41:11.727 --> 03:41:13.538
MATT: Make a perception or investigation, your choice.

5582
03:41:13.538 --> 03:41:17.147
MARISHA: I will take that investigation fucking check.

5583
03:41:17.147 --> 03:41:17.980
LIAM: 21.

5584
03:41:17.980 --> 03:41:20.146
MARISHA: Jesus fucking Christ,
I'm supposed to be good at this

5585
03:41:20.146 --> 03:41:21.923
and I roll shitty every time.
MATT: I'm so sorry.

5586
03:41:21.923 --> 03:41:23.745
MARISHA: 11.

5587
03:41:23.745 --> 03:41:25.561
MATT: No.

5588
03:41:25.561 --> 03:41:27.758
It is simple, it is blank, nothing in the chamber

5589
03:41:27.758 --> 03:41:30.725
is meant to distract from the presentation of these objects.

5590
03:41:30.725 --> 03:41:32.218
They are the center of attention.

5591
03:41:32.218 --> 03:41:33.842
LIAM: Were the walls metallic?

5592
03:41:33.842 --> 03:41:35.356
MATT: No, they're stone.

5593
03:41:35.356 --> 03:41:38.570
They're carved from the interior of the mountain.

5594
03:41:38.570 --> 03:41:41.095
MARISHA: Is there any type of-- you said it's shaped

5595
03:41:41.095 --> 03:41:44.126
like a pentagram or a pentagon?

5596
03:41:44.126 --> 03:41:45.009
MATT: Pentagon.

5597
03:41:45.009 --> 03:41:48.522
MARISHA: Pentagon. Is there anything on the floor?

5598
03:41:48.522 --> 03:41:49.930
Drawn between the display

5599
03:41:49.930 --> 03:41:53.279
cases or any iconography?
MATT: No.

5600
03:41:53.279 --> 03:41:54.128
MARISHA: Okay.

5601
03:41:54.128 --> 03:41:56.260
LAURA: Why don't we just drag it open and take it?

5602
03:41:56.260 --> 03:41:57.243
LIAM: No, no, no.

5603
03:41:57.243 --> 03:41:59.740
SAM: We should do the one that we're here for.

5604
03:41:59.740 --> 03:42:02.000
LIAM: Which is this one, Jester?

5605
03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:03.591
LAURA: It's this ring right here, yeah.

5606
03:42:03.591 --> 03:42:06.821
SAM: If that one goes okay, we can talk about that book.

5607
03:42:06.821 --> 03:42:08.711
MICA: Would I recognize any of these items

5608
03:42:08.711 --> 03:42:12.499
from time with the Auditors or time I spent--

5609
03:42:12.499 --> 03:42:13.981
MATT: You can roll a history check.
MICA: All right.

5610
03:42:13.981 --> 03:42:16.496
MATT: Or arcana, your choice.

5611
03:42:16.496 --> 03:42:18.203
Actually, arcana would be more the one for this one.

5612
03:42:18.203 --> 03:42:19.441
MICA: Okay.

5613
03:42:19.441 --> 03:42:21.119
SAM: Sweat stains in the pits.

5614
03:42:21.119 --> 03:42:22.449
MICA: 11.
MATT: 11?

5615
03:42:22.449 --> 03:42:24.259
You have no idea.
MICA: No idea?

5616
03:42:24.259 --> 03:42:28.912
LIAM: So I have a couple of attempts at pulling away magic

5617
03:42:28.912 --> 03:42:31.704
from some of these cases.

5618
03:42:31.704 --> 03:42:33.824
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: The two big ones.

5619
03:42:33.824 --> 03:42:34.831
LIAM: And then--

5620
03:42:34.831 --> 03:42:35.994
LAURA: Like Dispel Magic, you mean?

5621
03:42:35.994 --> 03:42:38.752
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I will dispel the magic if I'm able to,

5622
03:42:38.752 --> 03:42:41.483
if it's not too strong, and then my cat will maybe

5623
03:42:41.483 --> 03:42:43.400
give a little sniff to each thing

5624
03:42:43.400 --> 03:42:46.636
and we'll see if he survives it.

5625
03:42:46.636 --> 03:42:47.740
SAM: Okay.

5626
03:42:47.740 --> 03:42:50.023
Let's start with the ring.
MICA: I also have Henry.

5627
03:42:50.023 --> 03:42:52.232
SAM: That's right.
LIAM: That's even better.

5628
03:42:52.232 --> 03:42:55.209
LAURA: Let's try to dispel some magic.

5629
03:42:55.209 --> 03:42:56.342
LIAM: Yeah.

5630
03:42:56.342 --> 03:42:59.307
Let's do the... ring first.

5631
03:42:59.307 --> 03:43:01.659
TALIESIN: What's the worst that can happen?

5632
03:43:01.659 --> 03:43:03.877
SAM: Do you want to test it out on the book one?

5633
03:43:03.877 --> 03:43:05.717
LIAM: No, we came here for the ring.

5634
03:43:05.717 --> 03:43:10.101
TALIESIN: What's the worst that can happen
if this goes wrong?

5635
03:43:10.101 --> 03:43:11.330
LAURA: We all die.

5636
03:43:11.330 --> 03:43:13.160
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say, alarm goes off,

5637
03:43:13.160 --> 03:43:17.768
a giant monster comes busting out

5638
03:43:17.768 --> 03:43:20.676
from another dimension
that they've locked away.

5639
03:43:20.676 --> 03:43:23.188
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to cast Resistance on Caleb then,

5640
03:43:23.188 --> 03:43:25.291
so you just get to-- just in case you need a saving throw,

5641
03:43:25.291 --> 03:43:26.824
there's a d4 in there for you.

5642
03:43:26.824 --> 03:43:28.637
MATT: For the next round, you mean?

5643
03:43:28.637 --> 03:43:29.803
TALIESIN: No, one minute.

5644
03:43:29.803 --> 03:43:32.203
MATT: Oh Resistance, sorry, I was thinking of

5645
03:43:32.203 --> 03:43:33.036
another cantrip.
LIAM: Everyone

5646
03:43:33.036 --> 03:43:34.241
back out of the room with me.

5647
03:43:34.241 --> 03:43:35.641
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to back out of the room.

5648
03:43:35.641 --> 03:43:37.853
LIAM: I'm going to do this at a distance.

5649
03:43:37.853 --> 03:43:41.718
How far away can I get and still see?

5650
03:43:41.718 --> 03:43:42.683
MATT: About 40 feet.

5651
03:43:42.683 --> 03:43:44.298
LIAM: In this case, so I will stand 40 feet back

5652
03:43:44.298 --> 03:43:45.453
with everybody, hopefully--

5653
03:43:45.453 --> 03:43:48.494
MATT: Yeah, before the tunnel begins to
cut off your visual range.

5654
03:43:49.544 --> 03:43:52.087
LIAM: And wave my hand in the air and mutter a word or two

5655
03:43:52.087 --> 03:43:55.948
and cast Dispel Magic on our target.

5656
03:43:55.948 --> 03:43:57.096
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20 and add

5657
03:43:57.096 --> 03:43:58.819
your intelligence modifier.

5658
03:44:00.152 --> 03:44:01.064
LIAM: 19.

5659
03:44:01.064 --> 03:44:02.287
MATT: 19.

5660
03:44:02.287 --> 03:44:06.167
You release the spell, you see the faint shimmer once more

5661
03:44:06.167 --> 03:44:09.973
of the dispel, like a slight distortion visually.

5662
03:44:09.973 --> 03:44:10.936
LIAM: Nott the Brave.

5663
03:44:10.936 --> 03:44:11.948
SAM: Did it work?

5664
03:44:11.948 --> 03:44:13.401
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Oh, great.

5665
03:44:13.401 --> 03:44:15.823
LIAM: Do you want to see if it is locked as well?

5666
03:44:15.823 --> 03:44:17.171
SAM: Sure.

5667
03:44:17.171 --> 03:44:18.997
TALIESIN: I put the d4 on you now.

5668
03:44:18.997 --> 03:44:22.138
SAM: Great, I'll go over with my

5669
03:44:22.138 --> 03:44:25.488
Mage Hand and try to--

5670
03:44:25.488 --> 03:44:27.310
can Mage Hand investigate?

5671
03:44:27.310 --> 03:44:29.730
No, I have to investigate, the the Mage Hand can do things.

5672
03:44:29.730 --> 03:44:31.875
MATT: The Mage Hand can use your
thieves' tools at a distance.

5673
03:44:31.875 --> 03:44:33.916
SAM: So I'll go investigate to see if it's locked.

5674
03:44:33.916 --> 03:44:35.724
MATT: Okay.

5675
03:44:35.724 --> 03:44:36.566
SAM: 17?

5676
03:44:36.566 --> 03:44:37.399
MATT: Definitely locked.

5677
03:44:37.399 --> 03:44:39.762
SAM: Okay, I'll back up.
MATT: It is a very intricate lock.

5678
03:44:39.762 --> 03:44:40.703
SAM: Oh, fuck.

5679
03:44:40.703 --> 03:44:42.669
I'll back up 29 feet, and--

5680
03:44:42.669 --> 03:44:44.351
LIAM: Can anybody help her out here?

5681
03:44:44.351 --> 03:44:45.485
TALIESIN: I have another d4 on that.

5682
03:44:45.485 --> 03:44:47.168
LIAM: Yeah yeah, anybody else?

5683
03:44:47.168 --> 03:44:49.741
LAURA: I mean, it's a saving throw, Bless.

5684
03:44:49.741 --> 03:44:52.446
MARISHA: I mean going to guard the door, just in case.

5685
03:44:52.446 --> 03:44:53.279
MATT: Okay.

5686
03:44:53.279 --> 03:44:55.364
TALIESIN: No ability bonuses.
LIAM: No, I can't.

5687
03:44:55.364 --> 03:44:56.939
LAURA: Tell you what, Nott,

5688
03:44:56.939 --> 03:44:59.656
you're the coolest, you can do it.

5689
03:44:59.656 --> 03:45:01.082
SAM: d10 inspiration.

5690
03:45:01.082 --> 03:45:02.795
LAURA: (laughing)

5691
03:45:02.795 --> 03:45:04.612
MATT: All righty.

5692
03:45:04.612 --> 03:45:08.637
SAM: All right, I will Mage Hand and try to pick the lock.

5693
03:45:11.362 --> 03:45:12.868
26.

5694
03:45:12.868 --> 03:45:14.301
MATT: 26.

5695
03:45:14.301 --> 03:45:15.134
TALIESIN: Damn.

5696
03:45:15.134 --> 03:45:16.967
MATT: You watch as the thieves' tools

5697
03:45:16.967 --> 03:45:19.867
gently drift over with the faint outline

5698
03:45:19.867 --> 03:45:21.565
of the Mage Hand drifting it there.

5699
03:45:21.565 --> 03:45:25.360
As she concentrates, you watch them shift and turn,

5700
03:45:25.360 --> 03:45:28.871
and one latch opens, but it's a multi-tiered latch,

5701
03:45:28.871 --> 03:45:30.584
it's like three locks in one.

5702
03:45:30.584 --> 03:45:32.921
And with each one you unlock, it pulls one of the tools away

5703
03:45:32.921 --> 03:45:34.151
and you have to push in further, unlocks,

5704
03:45:34.151 --> 03:45:35.148
then pulls it away.

5705
03:45:35.148 --> 03:45:37.463
It's like fractal of a lock.
LAURA: That's fucking awesome.

5706
03:45:37.463 --> 03:45:39.210
MATT: And as you're concentrating and sweating

5707
03:45:39.210 --> 03:45:41.327
and gritting your teeth, you can taste blood

5708
03:45:41.327 --> 03:45:43.285
as you bite your lip, just concentrating,

5709
03:45:43.285 --> 03:45:45.494
and then (clicks and creaks).
(gasping)

5710
03:45:45.494 --> 03:45:46.627
MATT: Then the lid opens.

5711
03:45:46.627 --> 03:45:47.680
LAURA: (gasps)

5712
03:45:47.680 --> 03:45:50.346
LIAM: Use your Mage Hand again.

5713
03:45:50.346 --> 03:45:51.179
TALIESIN: Mage Hand.

5714
03:45:51.179 --> 03:45:54.497
SAM: I will Mage Hand to pick up the ring.

5715
03:45:54.497 --> 03:45:55.499
MATT: Okay.

5716
03:45:55.499 --> 03:45:57.288
Carrying the tools in your hand--

5717
03:45:57.288 --> 03:45:59.116
SAM: Oh, I'll bring the tools back.

5718
03:45:59.116 --> 03:46:00.766
MATT: Bring it back.
SAM: Put it in my pocket.

5719
03:46:00.766 --> 03:46:02.567
LAURA: Grab the whole pillow.
MATT: The ring drifts.

5720
03:46:02.567 --> 03:46:04.530
LAURA: Just kidding, grab the ring.

5721
03:46:04.530 --> 03:46:06.613
Oh my gosh, we've got it.
MATT: And it's in your palm.

5722
03:46:08.393 --> 03:46:10.445
SAM: Okay.

5723
03:46:10.445 --> 03:46:12.293
What do you want to do now?
MARISHA: Question.

5724
03:46:12.293 --> 03:46:13.201
TALIESIN: Put it in the bag.

5725
03:46:13.201 --> 03:46:15.301
MARISHA: Should I take it and get out of here

5726
03:46:15.301 --> 03:46:18.254
while you guys see if you want to finish the rest of this?

5727
03:46:18.254 --> 03:46:19.087
SAM: That's not bad.

5728
03:46:19.087 --> 03:46:21.245
TALIESIN: Not a bad idea.
LIAM: How are you going to do that?

5729
03:46:21.245 --> 03:46:23.859
MARISHA: Go out the way we came.
SAM: She's the fucking coolest.

5730
03:46:23.859 --> 03:46:26.019
LIAM: I know she's cool, but--

5731
03:46:26.911 --> 03:46:30.001
TALIESIN: All right, I think that's a good idea.

5732
03:46:30.001 --> 03:46:31.125
MARISHA: I don't know.

5733
03:46:31.125 --> 03:46:32.201
LIAM: Maybe hit the roof at least,

5734
03:46:32.201 --> 03:46:33.963
so that you have eyes on the outside?

5735
03:46:33.963 --> 03:46:35.613
MARISHA: Yeah.
MICA: I can take her.

5736
03:46:37.506 --> 03:46:38.704
LIAM: Okay.

5737
03:46:38.704 --> 03:46:39.875
MARISHA: Buddy system?
LIAM: Yeah.

5738
03:46:39.875 --> 03:46:40.785
LAURA: Okay.

5739
03:46:40.785 --> 03:46:41.832
LIAM: Buddy system.

5740
03:46:41.832 --> 03:46:42.665
MARISHA: I feel weird being

5741
03:46:42.665 --> 03:46:45.860
away from Fjord.
LAURA: Nobody gets left behind or forgotten.

5742
03:46:45.860 --> 03:46:46.926
MICA: Oh.

5743
03:46:46.926 --> 03:46:48.130
(laughter)

5744
03:46:48.130 --> 03:46:50.706
TRAVIS: Did you just fucking Lilo and Stitch?

5745
03:46:50.706 --> 03:46:52.826
Jesus.

5746
03:46:52.826 --> 03:46:54.432
Did you just ohana?

5747
03:46:54.432 --> 03:46:56.682
(laughter)

5748
03:46:57.558 --> 03:46:59.971
MATT: All righty, so what's the plan?

5749
03:46:59.971 --> 03:47:01.345
LIAM: We'll wait till they go up.

5750
03:47:01.345 --> 03:47:02.309
MATT: All right, so you guys make your way

5751
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:03.310
towards the roof again?

5752
03:47:03.310 --> 03:47:05.497
MARISHA: And we're going to stealth
the fuck outta that shit.

5753
03:47:05.497 --> 03:47:06.688
SAM: She's taking the ring.

5754
03:47:06.688 --> 03:47:07.521
MATT: All right.

5755
03:47:07.521 --> 03:47:09.404
How are you stealthing away?

5756
03:47:09.404 --> 03:47:10.979
MARISHA: How?
MATT: Yeah.

5757
03:47:12.728 --> 03:47:15.642
MARISHA: By my dope monk skills.

5758
03:47:15.642 --> 03:47:16.595
LIAM: They're going up to the roof.

5759
03:47:16.595 --> 03:47:17.531
MATT: Oh, so you're not leaving the roof,

5760
03:47:17.531 --> 03:47:18.546
you're going to the roof?

5761
03:47:18.546 --> 03:47:21.105
Roll a stealth check for both of you guys.

5762
03:47:21.988 --> 03:47:23.770
SAM: Oh boy.
LAURA: Stay to the back.

5763
03:47:23.770 --> 03:47:24.907
MARISHA: 24.

5764
03:47:24.907 --> 03:47:26.660
MATT: All right.

5765
03:47:26.660 --> 03:47:27.730
LAURA: (whispering) You got it.

5766
03:47:27.730 --> 03:47:29.335
MICA: (exhales) 15.

5767
03:47:29.335 --> 03:47:32.836
MATT: 15, you both gingerly tiptoe your way back to the roof,

5768
03:47:32.836 --> 03:47:37.620
climbing up through the hole, helping get Reani up,

5769
03:47:37.620 --> 03:47:40.476
and both of you find yourselves sitting on the roof quietly,

5770
03:47:40.476 --> 03:47:42.792
successfully stealthed.

5771
03:47:42.792 --> 03:47:45.875
LIAM: All right, Mighty Nein, rinse and repeat.

5772
03:47:45.875 --> 03:47:47.483
TALIESIN: Tap you for a d4.

5773
03:47:47.483 --> 03:47:49.664
LAURA: Don't use up all your spells because
you're going to have to

5774
03:47:49.664 --> 03:47:52.776
invisible people off the roof.

5775
03:47:52.776 --> 03:47:55.348
TALIESIN: Well, we'll figure something out.

5776
03:47:55.348 --> 03:47:57.250
SAM: Can't you just Dimension Door all of us?

5777
03:47:57.250 --> 03:47:58.483
LAURA: Just one other person.

5778
03:47:58.483 --> 03:48:01.944
LIAM: I am hoping to just use one more spell in here only.

5779
03:48:01.944 --> 03:48:03.667
LAURA: Okay.

5780
03:48:03.667 --> 03:48:05.946
TRAVIS: Which one is it, which item, which item?

5781
03:48:05.946 --> 03:48:07.738
LAURA: Of course, which one do you think?
LIAM: The book.

5782
03:48:07.738 --> 03:48:10.100
MATT: The book, okay.

5783
03:48:10.100 --> 03:48:13.309
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.

5784
03:48:15.335 --> 03:48:17.147
LIAM: 24.
SAM: (gasps)

5785
03:48:17.147 --> 03:48:19.309
MATT: You are rolling well tonight.

5786
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:23.761
LIAM: Making up for last week's trapped in the countryside.

5787
03:48:23.761 --> 03:48:26.723
MATT: This one's to the immediate left of the entry way.

5788
03:48:26.723 --> 03:48:27.633
MARISHA: What?!

5789
03:48:27.633 --> 03:48:28.491
MATT: So you look over to it,

5790
03:48:28.491 --> 03:48:30.199
concentrate.
LIAM: You were fantastic.

5791
03:48:31.551 --> 03:48:34.284
You see a slight spark fade.

5792
03:48:35.256 --> 03:48:36.768
LAURA: Nice.

5793
03:48:36.768 --> 03:48:38.659
LIAM: Okay, okay, okay.

5794
03:48:39.863 --> 03:48:41.153
One midnight gone.

5795
03:48:42.303 --> 03:48:44.553
LAURA: (laughing)

5796
03:48:46.237 --> 03:48:48.479
♪ One midnight gone ♪

5797
03:48:48.479 --> 03:48:50.579
LIAM: I reach my hand out and place it on Nott's shoulder

5798
03:48:50.579 --> 03:48:51.679
and cast--

5799
03:48:52.701 --> 03:48:54.730
no, I resist the urge.

5800
03:48:54.730 --> 03:48:57.588
TALIESIN: Just giving you the d4 now, Nott.

5801
03:48:58.952 --> 03:49:00.093
SAM: Is it up to me?

5802
03:49:00.093 --> 03:49:01.478
TALIESIN: Yep.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

5803
03:49:01.478 --> 03:49:02.844
TALIESIN: I have a plan B, but yeah.

5804
03:49:02.844 --> 03:49:05.377
LAURA: I've got a plan C.

5805
03:49:05.377 --> 03:49:07.453
SAM: I'll take another nip of liquor.

5806
03:49:07.453 --> 03:49:09.012
MATT: Okay.

5807
03:49:09.012 --> 03:49:11.874
SAM: (exhaling)
(groaning)

5808
03:49:11.874 --> 03:49:12.949
Sorry.

5809
03:49:14.306 --> 03:49:17.047
I will Mage Hand-- oh, first I'll go investigate,

5810
03:49:17.047 --> 03:49:17.961
see if it's locked.

5811
03:49:17.961 --> 03:49:19.128
MATT: Okay.

5812
03:49:19.128 --> 03:49:21.100
SAM: That's a crazy roll.

5813
03:49:21.100 --> 03:49:22.284
Natural one.

5814
03:49:23.236 --> 03:49:24.520
MATT: I mean--

5815
03:49:24.520 --> 03:49:25.745
SAM: It's locked.

5816
03:49:25.745 --> 03:49:29.395
SAM: You look at it and you're like, I mean,

5817
03:49:29.395 --> 03:49:32.328
it looks like the same sort of arrangement

5818
03:49:32.328 --> 03:49:34.235
as the other things there.

5819
03:49:34.235 --> 03:49:35.676
TALIESIN: That's a good place to get your natural one out.

5820
03:49:35.676 --> 03:49:38.825
SAM: I don't see a lock, but I'll guess that one's there.

5821
03:49:38.825 --> 03:49:41.043
MATT: I'll say with your intelligence as high as it is,

5822
03:49:41.043 --> 03:49:43.903
you surmise that it's locked in a similar fashion.

5823
03:49:43.903 --> 03:49:48.486
SAM: Okay, I will cast Mage Hand and I will pick the lock.

5824
03:49:49.322 --> 03:49:50.917
Similar, 26.

5825
03:49:50.917 --> 03:49:52.433
MATT: 26.
TALIESIN: Jesus.

5826
03:49:53.677 --> 03:49:55.002
MATT: (creaks)

5827
03:49:55.002 --> 03:49:56.720
Opens up.

5828
03:49:56.720 --> 03:49:58.445
SAM: Your book, sir.

5829
03:49:59.744 --> 03:50:02.909
LIAM: Would you carry from afar down onto the ground?

5830
03:50:02.909 --> 03:50:05.099
SAM: Sure, I grab it.

5831
03:50:05.099 --> 03:50:06.986
I'll bring it to him.
LIAM: Okay.

5832
03:50:06.986 --> 03:50:10.188
MATT: You can already smell the musty scent off of it.

5833
03:50:10.188 --> 03:50:11.622
LIAM: (contented sigh)

5834
03:50:11.622 --> 03:50:13.543
(laughter)

5835
03:50:13.543 --> 03:50:16.829
LIAM: Frumpkin apparates next to me,

5836
03:50:16.829 --> 03:50:21.499
and I ask him to set his front paws on the book.

5837
03:50:21.499 --> 03:50:23.384
MATT: (mews)

5838
03:50:23.384 --> 03:50:25.051
LIAM: That's a good boy.

5839
03:50:25.051 --> 03:50:26.646
MATT: (purrs)

5840
03:50:26.646 --> 03:50:30.146
LIAM: (contented sighing)

5841
03:50:31.894 --> 03:50:33.889
What else do we want to do here?

5842
03:50:33.889 --> 03:50:37.151
SAM: Take everything in the room!

5843
03:50:37.151 --> 03:50:39.836
LAURA: They're going to be so pissed, you guys.

5844
03:50:39.836 --> 03:50:42.167
LIAM: So, so so so, so.

5845
03:50:42.167 --> 03:50:45.334
We need to be able to get out of here.

5846
03:50:47.175 --> 03:50:50.632
I have the ability--

5847
03:50:50.632 --> 03:50:52.958
LAURA: How strong is your Dispel Magic, is it like

5848
03:50:52.958 --> 03:50:56.720
super-duper strong or is it like level two and three strong,

5849
03:50:56.720 --> 03:50:59.733
or is it like level five strong?

5850
03:50:59.733 --> 03:51:02.638
LIAM: Well, I could only do that one more time,

5851
03:51:02.638 --> 03:51:04.122
for one more of these.

5852
03:51:04.122 --> 03:51:06.405
I am getting pretty tapped.

5853
03:51:06.405 --> 03:51:11.053
I can still cast Invisibility on one person at a time,

5854
03:51:11.053 --> 03:51:12.447
three times.

5855
03:51:12.447 --> 03:51:16.613
TALIESIN: Let's maybe, I don't know, I'm feeling like we--

5856
03:51:16.613 --> 03:51:18.490
I feel like two is a good number.

5857
03:51:18.490 --> 03:51:19.888
LAURA: Maybe don't press our luck?

5858
03:51:19.888 --> 03:51:22.264
TALIESIN: I feel like we've pressed our luck.

5859
03:51:22.264 --> 03:51:23.919
SAM: We have.

5860
03:51:23.919 --> 03:51:25.557
LIAM: What are the three remaining objects again?

5861
03:51:25.557 --> 03:51:26.390
TALIESIN: A ring.

5862
03:51:26.390 --> 03:51:29.792
MATT: There is the vial of quicksilver type liquid,

5863
03:51:29.792 --> 03:51:32.169
there is the silver and gold ring

5864
03:51:32.169 --> 03:51:34.112
with the runes across the top and bottom,

5865
03:51:34.112 --> 03:51:36.170
and there is the beautiful wand.

5866
03:51:36.170 --> 03:51:38.280
TRAVIS: Multi-colored power.

5867
03:51:38.280 --> 03:51:40.312
TALIESIN: That's really hard to pin down.

5868
03:51:40.312 --> 03:51:42.704
TRAVIS: Beyond description.

5869
03:51:42.704 --> 03:51:45.692
LAURA: I really like things that are rainbow colored.

5870
03:51:45.692 --> 03:51:48.236
TRAVIS: Wand of Eternity!

5871
03:51:48.236 --> 03:51:49.409
LAURA: I also really like rings.

5872
03:51:49.409 --> 03:51:51.076
SAM: Wow, what is that?

5873
03:51:52.073 --> 03:51:55.915
TRAVIS: (whispering) Untold ability.

5874
03:51:55.915 --> 03:51:59.512
LAURA: I can try to do what you were doing.

5875
03:51:59.512 --> 03:52:02.190
SAM: Do you have Dispel Magic?
TRAVIS: (whispering) Harry.

5876
03:52:02.190 --> 03:52:03.273
SAM: Go for it.

5877
03:52:03.273 --> 03:52:05.588
LAURA: But I don't know how high I have to cast it.

5878
03:52:05.588 --> 03:52:06.438
SAM: Just do it.

5879
03:52:06.438 --> 03:52:08.859
TALIESIN: Cast it, take a--

5880
03:52:08.859 --> 03:52:10.237
LIAM: Real high.

5881
03:52:10.237 --> 03:52:11.842
LAURA: Real high?

5882
03:52:11.842 --> 03:52:13.150
TALIESIN: d4.

5883
03:52:13.150 --> 03:52:14.432
LAURA: Hmm, I can't use--

5884
03:52:14.432 --> 03:52:16.891
TRAVIS: Meanwhile, I have this damn thing.

5885
03:52:16.891 --> 03:52:18.141
LAURA: I don't know.

5886
03:52:18.141 --> 03:52:19.346
(laughter)

5887
03:52:19.346 --> 03:52:21.148
MATT: Just sitting here with your fucking Dispel Stone,

5888
03:52:21.148 --> 03:52:24.445
just like "Hmm."
MICA: Wouldn't that be nice?

5889
03:52:24.445 --> 03:52:26.271
TRAVIS: Or this dagger that just, you know,

5890
03:52:26.271 --> 03:52:28.931
goes into a keyhole and locks and unlocks it.

5891
03:52:28.931 --> 03:52:31.301
LIAM: It's spellcasting modifier, right?

5892
03:52:31.301 --> 03:52:32.499
LAURA: Huh?

5893
03:52:32.499 --> 03:52:34.455
LIAM: Is the bonus going into it.

5894
03:52:34.455 --> 03:52:35.689
LAURA: Oh, right.

5895
03:52:35.689 --> 03:52:37.514
LIAM: So your WIS.

5896
03:52:37.514 --> 03:52:38.895
LAURA: My wisdom is really high, but--

5897
03:52:38.895 --> 03:52:40.463
MATT: Only unlocks its own lock.

5898
03:52:40.463 --> 03:52:45.379
SAM: Well, the DC is actually-- on her it's DC plus level.

5899
03:52:45.379 --> 03:52:46.447
LIAM: Yeah.

5900
03:52:46.447 --> 03:52:49.192
MATT: The DC is 10 plus the level of whatever

5901
03:52:49.192 --> 03:52:51.876
the enchantment spell is.
LIAM: Yeah.

5902
03:52:51.876 --> 03:52:53.310
LAURA: Oh, okay.
MATT: You're trying to beat that.

5903
03:52:53.310 --> 03:52:54.978
You don't know what level that is.

5904
03:52:54.978 --> 03:52:57.306
LAURA: Okay, make an ability check using--

5905
03:52:57.306 --> 03:53:00.139
oh, so then I would roll and then--

5906
03:53:01.329 --> 03:53:03.466
MATT: You would roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

5907
03:53:03.466 --> 03:53:04.699
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5908
03:53:04.699 --> 03:53:08.648
Then I'm going to cast Dispel Magic on the

5909
03:53:08.648 --> 03:53:09.881
wand one.

5910
03:53:09.881 --> 03:53:13.866
MATT: Okay, roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

5911
03:53:15.624 --> 03:53:18.707
You guys are cleaning these guys out.

5912
03:53:20.044 --> 03:53:23.268
SAM: They could come home at any moment.

5913
03:53:23.268 --> 03:53:24.101
Okay.

5914
03:53:25.130 --> 03:53:27.910
LAURA: Wisdom modifier, 16?

5915
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:28.743
MATT: 16.

5916
03:53:29.842 --> 03:53:34.842
You watch as the energy ripple, similar to Caleb's,

5917
03:53:34.930 --> 03:53:38.509
but it has like a slight greenish tint to it,

5918
03:53:38.509 --> 03:53:40.960
as it (whooshes) dissipates it.

5919
03:53:40.960 --> 03:53:43.368
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's a different kind of magic.

5920
03:53:43.368 --> 03:53:45.368
SAM: Did it feel like it worked?

5921
03:53:45.368 --> 03:53:47.865
MATT: With a bit of Traveler flavor.

5922
03:53:47.865 --> 03:53:49.290
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh.

5923
03:53:50.296 --> 03:53:52.823
LAURA: Yeah, the Traveler was with me, it's gone.

5924
03:53:52.823 --> 03:53:54.526
SAM: All right.

5925
03:53:54.526 --> 03:53:55.825
I'm feeling cocky.

5926
03:53:55.825 --> 03:53:57.872
TALIESIN: d4 there.

5927
03:53:57.872 --> 03:54:00.159
SAM: I'm going to take a little nip.

5928
03:54:00.159 --> 03:54:01.142
TRAVIS: Jesus.

5929
03:54:01.142 --> 03:54:04.096
LIAM: I reach out and grip her wrist.
LAURA: Nott, stop. Yeah.

5930
03:54:04.096 --> 03:54:08.299
LIAM: Maybe we celebrate with a drink on the outside, yeah?

5931
03:54:08.299 --> 03:54:09.766
LAURA: No nips before, okay?

5932
03:54:09.766 --> 03:54:11.897
SAM: This isn't for fun.

5933
03:54:11.897 --> 03:54:12.858
But all right.

5934
03:54:12.858 --> 03:54:14.855
LAURA: You've nipped it up real good.

5935
03:54:14.855 --> 03:54:15.871
LIAM: Wait.

5936
03:54:17.214 --> 03:54:18.946
TRAVIS: Do you get advantage when you drink?

5937
03:54:18.946 --> 03:54:21.463
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: Quite the opposite.

5938
03:54:22.301 --> 03:54:25.764
LIAM: I rest my hand on her shoulder.

5939
03:54:25.764 --> 03:54:27.260
SAM: Thank you.
LIAM: Go ahead.

5940
03:54:27.260 --> 03:54:30.510
SAM: I will roll to unlock with Mage Hand.

5941
03:54:32.909 --> 03:54:34.857

03:54:41.115 --> 03:54:41.948
Nope.

5946
03:54:42.799 --> 03:54:45.325

5947
03:54:45.325 --> 03:54:46.158

MATT: You don't know what that means.

5949
03:54:50.327 --> 03:54:51.236
LAURA: We should get out of here.

03:54:51.236 --> 03:54:52.210

5951
03:54:52.210 --> 03:54:53.326

TALIESIN: We're making our way out.

into the next hallway, into the room with the hole up top.

5974
03:55:44.658 --> 03:55:46.866
Nobody seems to notice at the moment.

5975
03:55:46.866 --> 03:55:49.287
One by one, you help each other up
and you're back onto the roof.

5976
03:55:49.287 --> 03:55:51.304
You guys watch as the rest of your friends arrive.

5977
03:55:51.304 --> 03:55:52.588
MARISHA: Good, good, good, good.

5978
03:55:52.588 --> 03:55:53.595
TALIESIN: We got to get outta here now.

5979
03:55:53.595 --> 03:55:54.995
I think we tripped something, we got to go.

5980
03:55:54.995 --> 03:55:56.650
SAM: I could go back and get it.

5981
03:55:56.650 --> 03:55:59.631
The magic is dispelled, we could just knock over the thing,

5982
03:55:59.631 --> 03:56:00.588
just smash through.

5983
03:56:00.588 --> 03:56:01.785
LAURA: Something happened on the trap.

5984
03:56:01.785 --> 03:56:03.605
I think they know we're there.

5985
03:56:03.605 --> 03:56:04.755
SAM: But they're not there.

5986
03:56:04.755 --> 03:56:06.750
LAURA: Good thing we were staying outside of the room, huh?

5987
03:56:06.750 --> 03:56:09.545
MARISHA: You killed a guard.

5988
03:56:09.545 --> 03:56:11.207
SAM: Don't tell Reani that.

5989
03:56:11.207 --> 03:56:12.417
LAURA: She already knows.
MICA: I already know.

5990
03:56:12.417 --> 03:56:13.509
LIAM: She's right here.

5991
03:56:13.509 --> 03:56:14.397
TALIESIN: Okay, we got to go.

5992
03:56:14.397 --> 03:56:17.725
MATT: You hear a voice go, echoing in the courtyard.

5993
03:56:17.725 --> 03:56:21.175
"Hey, hey, we got to check inside."

5994
03:56:22.995 --> 03:56:24.047
SAM: Are we on the roof yet?

5995
03:56:24.047 --> 03:56:25.031
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: You're on the roof, yeah.

5996
03:56:25.031 --> 03:56:28.350
SAM: I'm casting Message.
Fjord, Fjord, we're made, we're made.

5997
03:56:28.350 --> 03:56:29.577
Kill the guards in the front.

5998
03:56:29.577 --> 03:56:31.240
LAURA: No, no, no!

5999
03:56:31.240 --> 03:56:33.665
MATT: He's too far away.
LAURA: Thank god.

6000
03:56:33.665 --> 03:56:34.928
Everybody, I can--

6001
03:56:34.928 --> 03:56:36.050
MATT: You pulled him off to the alleyway,

6002
03:56:36.050 --> 03:56:38.484
and you've just been walking around,
or are you staying near the house?

6003
03:56:38.484 --> 03:56:39.839
LIAM: There's two guards.

6004
03:56:39.839 --> 03:56:41.650
MATT: Okay, then you may have heard that.

6005
03:56:41.650 --> 03:56:45.440
LAURA: I'm going to grab Caduceus, because he's the biggest

6006
03:56:45.440 --> 03:56:46.861
and it'll be the hardest, and I'm going to

6007
03:56:46.861 --> 03:56:48.357
Dimension Door me and him.

6008
03:56:48.357 --> 03:56:49.993
MATT: To?

6009
03:56:49.993 --> 03:56:52.357
LAURA: 500 feet away from the fucking house.
MATT: All right.

6010
03:56:52.357 --> 03:56:55.057
LAURA: Like in a back alley, if I can see one.

6011
03:56:55.057 --> 03:56:56.601
MATT: You don't know this city very well.

6012
03:56:56.601 --> 03:57:01.601
I will say go ahead and roll

6013
03:57:01.642 --> 03:57:03.692
an intelligence check for me.

6014
03:57:08.688 --> 03:57:10.662
TALIESIN: You have one more shape.
MICA: I do.

6015
03:57:10.662 --> 03:57:12.397
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.
MICA: I do.

6016
03:57:12.397 --> 03:57:14.239
LAURA: Do I still have that extra luck thing?

6017
03:57:14.239 --> 03:57:15.095
No, that was from last night.

6018
03:57:15.095 --> 03:57:16.294
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: 13.

6019
03:57:16.294 --> 03:57:17.469
MATT: 13, okay.

6020
03:57:17.469 --> 03:57:19.806
You vaguely remember maybe glancing out

6021
03:57:19.806 --> 03:57:21.772
of the corner of your eye at an alleyway at one point,

6022
03:57:21.772 --> 03:57:23.268
and you hope and concentrate on that,

6023
03:57:23.268 --> 03:57:26.261
and both you and Caduceus appear in a shadowed alleyway

6024
03:57:26.261 --> 03:57:28.411
inches from the stone wall and like, oh.

6025
03:57:28.411 --> 03:57:31.323
TALIESIN: Transmute into an elf, I Disguise Self elf.

6026
03:57:31.323 --> 03:57:32.156
MATT: You got it, okay.

6027
03:57:32.156 --> 03:57:34.188
LAURA: Same. Same.

6028
03:57:34.188 --> 03:57:35.725
MATT: All right. The rest of you.

6029
03:57:35.725 --> 03:57:36.957
LIAM: While you were doing that I'm going to go

6030
03:57:36.957 --> 03:57:38.115
peek down over the front.

6031
03:57:38.115 --> 03:57:40.315
Are they still out there, or do they immediately go in?

6032
03:57:40.315 --> 03:57:41.999
MATT: They have entered the front door.

6033
03:57:41.999 --> 03:57:44.037
SAM: Did Fjord respond to me?

6034
03:57:44.037 --> 03:57:45.379
MATT: Fjord, have you responded?

6035
03:57:45.379 --> 03:57:46.212
TRAVIS: Did I hear them?

6036
03:57:46.212 --> 03:57:47.539
MATT: I'll say you would've heard him, if you're wandering.

6037
03:57:47.539 --> 03:57:50.147
TRAVIS: Could I see where the guards are
and if they're acting batshit?

6038
03:57:50.147 --> 03:57:52.091
MATT: You see them heading into the house now.

6039
03:57:52.091 --> 03:57:54.472
TRAVIS: (loudly) Excuse me, excuse me.

6040
03:57:54.472 --> 03:57:56.155
SAM: Everyone hold, everyone hold.

6041
03:57:56.155 --> 03:57:57.415
TRAVIS: The master of the house--

6042
03:57:57.415 --> 03:58:00.798
MATT: They're inside the house.
They're not even listening.

6043
03:58:00.798 --> 03:58:04.955
Something-- they seem to be very much

6044
03:58:04.955 --> 03:58:07.663
on a sudden alert

6045
03:58:07.663 --> 03:58:08.926
and rushing into the home.

6046
03:58:08.926 --> 03:58:10.189
TRAVIS: Oh god, I start looking around,

6047
03:58:10.189 --> 03:58:12.255
like looking up on the roof, looking out.

6048
03:58:12.255 --> 03:58:13.772
Do I see anybody of the group?

6049
03:58:13.772 --> 03:58:16.507
MATT: Make a perception check.

6050
03:58:16.507 --> 03:58:17.463
TRAVIS: 12.

6051
03:58:17.463 --> 03:58:18.296
MATT: 12?

6052
03:58:18.296 --> 03:58:19.131
No, you don't.

6053
03:58:19.131 --> 03:58:21.437
LAURA: Can I pop out of the alleyway, do I see Fjord?

6054
03:58:21.437 --> 03:58:24.029
MATT: No, you guys are way off, you went 500 feet away,

6055
03:58:24.029 --> 03:58:25.975
he's like 115 feet away from the house.

6056
03:58:25.975 --> 03:58:27.987
TALIESIN: Meandering our way back towards the house, maybe--

6057
03:58:27.987 --> 03:58:29.761
MARISHA: Does anyone have a Mending or something where

6058
03:58:29.761 --> 03:58:31.988
we can put the hole back together that we put in the roof?

6059
03:58:31.988 --> 03:58:33.530
TRAVIS: More like the guard.

6060
03:58:33.530 --> 03:58:34.487
LIAM: We've already fucked this place.

6061
03:58:34.487 --> 03:58:38.059
MICA: The way that the city is built, if I flew straight up,

6062
03:58:38.059 --> 03:58:41.511
would I fly out of the city, or do I have to go--

6063
03:58:41.511 --> 03:58:43.495
MATT: No, you'd have to go all the way up

6064
03:58:43.495 --> 03:58:46.164
to the top of the Volition Disk and then

6065
03:58:46.164 --> 03:58:49.617
up through the central hole, where the entrance--

6066
03:58:49.617 --> 03:58:52.135
MICA: Is the street starting to be populated?

6067
03:58:52.135 --> 03:58:54.269
Like are there people, is it morning now?

6068
03:58:54.269 --> 03:58:55.691
MATT: You're getting pretty close.

6069
03:58:55.691 --> 03:58:57.958
You're starting to see more people than there were earlier.

6070
03:58:57.958 --> 03:59:00.279
A few folks are starting to emerge from their homes.

6071
03:59:00.279 --> 03:59:02.516
It's like 6:30 in the morning.

6072
03:59:02.516 --> 03:59:03.510
You would say--

6073
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:05.981
LIAM: So it's not dead, there are a couple of people about?

6074
03:59:05.981 --> 03:59:08.090
MATT: Like, you see two people in the streets.

6075
03:59:08.090 --> 03:59:09.871
It's beginning, people are starting to wake up,

6076
03:59:09.871 --> 03:59:11.871
and like, greet the day.

6077
03:59:13.362 --> 03:59:14.414
What are you doing?
LAURA: Invisibility,

6078
03:59:14.414 --> 03:59:16.127
can you do Invisibility?

6079
03:59:16.127 --> 03:59:17.727
It's just the three of you up there now.

6080
03:59:17.727 --> 03:59:18.560
MATT: Yep.

6081
03:59:18.560 --> 03:59:19.822
SAM: He can only do one at a time.

6082
03:59:19.822 --> 03:59:21.947
MARISHA: One, two, three, four.
MATT: Or four of you guys.

6083
03:59:21.947 --> 03:59:23.853
LAURA: Oh, but you can do it.

6084
03:59:23.853 --> 03:59:26.258
SAM: Yeah, but can you do-- at a time?

6085
03:59:26.258 --> 03:59:27.436
LIAM: One at a time right now.

6086
03:59:27.436 --> 03:59:30.828
Or I could do three people, but then I'm blowing

6087
03:59:30.828 --> 03:59:33.411
a 4th-level.
LAURA: Do it.

6088
03:59:33.411 --> 03:59:37.160
LIAM: Three people, but are you invisible still?

6089
03:59:37.160 --> 03:59:39.077
I can't remember.
MICA and MARISHA: No.

6090
03:59:39.999 --> 03:59:42.089
MICA: If you make me invisible, I can carry us off the roof.

6091
03:59:42.089 --> 03:59:42.922
LAURA: Yeah.

6092
03:59:46.489 --> 03:59:48.608
LAURA: I'm gone.
SAM: She's gone.

6093
03:59:48.608 --> 03:59:50.141
LAURA: I have Caduceus, we're out.

6094
03:59:50.141 --> 03:59:51.509
It's just you guys.

6095
03:59:51.509 --> 03:59:52.897
LIAM: Then these three, Nott, myself.

6096
03:59:52.897 --> 03:59:53.730
MATT: Okay.

6097
03:59:53.730 --> 03:59:55.419
SAM: Why don't you do yourself, I'll do me.

6098
03:59:55.419 --> 03:59:58.075
MARISHA: Yourself, and then yeah,
because we're stealthy as fuck.

6099
03:59:58.075 --> 03:59:59.673
LIAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

6100
03:59:59.673 --> 04:00:02.327
MATT: All right, so three invisible with Caleb there,

6101
04:00:02.327 --> 04:00:03.399
and you turn yourself invisible.

6102
04:00:03.399 --> 04:00:04.265
SAM: Yes.
MATT: All right.

6103
04:00:04.265 --> 04:00:06.034
Reani, what are you doing?

6104
04:00:06.034 --> 04:00:07.384
MICA: Giant owl.

6105
04:00:07.384 --> 04:00:09.831
MATT: You take a moment, feel around,

6106
04:00:09.831 --> 04:00:11.359
manage to grab the three of them,

6107
04:00:11.359 --> 04:00:15.152
thankfully as they're not the heaviest of the troupe.

6108
04:00:15.152 --> 04:00:19.994
MICA: Before I giant owl, can I Pass Without a Trace?

6109
04:00:19.994 --> 04:00:21.011
MATT: I'll allow it, yeah.

6110
04:00:21.011 --> 04:00:22.126
MICA: Sweet.

6111
04:00:22.126 --> 04:00:25.418
So I'm going to Pass Without a Trace all of us.

6112
04:00:25.418 --> 04:00:26.991
MATT: You maintain that concentration in your owl form.

6113
04:00:26.991 --> 04:00:27.853
MICA: Yep.

6114
04:00:27.853 --> 04:00:29.980
MATT: You do have disadvantage on your stealth check

6115
04:00:29.980 --> 04:00:31.650
because you are carrying three people,

6116
04:00:31.650 --> 04:00:33.396
but that balances out to a singular roll.

6117
04:00:33.396 --> 04:00:35.839
MICA: Okay, so single roll, and I get the extra 10

6118
04:00:35.839 --> 04:00:36.871
for Pass Without a Trace, right?

6119
04:00:36.871 --> 04:00:38.479
MATT: Correct.
MICA: Okay, let me find my--

6120
04:00:38.479 --> 04:00:41.218
MATT: So you're plus 18 to your roll. Total.

6121
04:00:41.218 --> 04:00:45.691
MATT: So, as Reani takes off as the owl,

6122
04:00:45.691 --> 04:00:49.794
invisibly from the site of this break-in entry,

6123
04:00:49.794 --> 04:00:52.710
I need you all to make stealth checks, please.

6124
04:00:54.547 --> 04:00:56.401
You would have disadvantage, I'm sorry,

6125
04:00:56.401 --> 04:00:58.183
because it doesn't give you advantage on the--

6126
04:00:58.183 --> 04:01:00.187
it's just plus 18 to whatever you--
MICA: So just plus 18?

6127
04:01:00.187 --> 04:01:01.398
MATT: Yeah, to whatever your disadvantage roll is.

6128
04:01:01.398 --> 04:01:04.366
LIAM: Is Reani's cargo Pass Without a Trace as well, right?

6129
04:01:04.366 --> 04:01:06.388
No, just one?
LAURA: No, I Dimension Doored us.

6130
04:01:06.388 --> 04:01:07.608
MATT: Well no, she cast it herself.

6131
04:01:07.608 --> 04:01:08.904
LAURA: Oh, never mind, I'm sorry.

6132
04:01:08.904 --> 04:01:10.125
MATT: Yeah, so you guys have it as well.

6133
04:01:10.125 --> 04:01:11.131
So I'm sorry, disadvantage on the roll,

6134
04:01:11.131 --> 04:01:12.235
but you add plus 18 to whatever you roll.

6135
04:01:12.235 --> 04:01:13.343
MICA: 21.
MATT: 21.

6136
04:01:14.239 --> 04:01:15.457
SAM: 25.
TALIESIN: 20.

6137
04:01:15.457 --> 04:01:16.364
MARISHA: 22.

6138
04:01:16.364 --> 04:01:17.705
SAM: Whoa.

6139
04:01:17.705 --> 04:01:20.349
LAURA: (lips fluttering)

6140
04:01:20.349 --> 04:01:24.214
MATT: You scoot off the roof, your feet catch

6141
04:01:24.214 --> 04:01:26.807
and knock some of the elements of the stone work

6142
04:01:26.807 --> 04:01:29.905
on the edge to tumble, but they fall silently

6143
04:01:29.905 --> 04:01:32.892
into the grass below.

6144
04:01:32.892 --> 04:01:35.991
Kind of like weird subterranean gardens

6145
04:01:35.991 --> 04:01:39.886
that they build here in the more upper class elements,

6146
04:01:39.886 --> 04:01:42.455
here in the Demerant Circle.

6147
04:01:42.455 --> 04:01:46.844
Quietly over the city, looking behind you, you can see now

6148
04:01:46.844 --> 04:01:51.134
the guards are now-- the lights are turning on in the house.

6149
04:01:51.134 --> 04:01:54.783
Certain window lights turning on in the house.

6150
04:01:54.783 --> 04:01:57.140
Who knows what else is going on in there right now,
but it's behind you.

6151
04:01:57.140 --> 04:02:00.540
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Fjord.

6152
04:02:00.540 --> 04:02:01.803
MATT: Okay.

6153
04:02:01.803 --> 04:02:04.046
SAM: Oh, yeah, he's still there?

6154
04:02:04.046 --> 04:02:06.602
TRAVIS: (drunkenly) Hey, you owe me money!

6155
04:02:06.602 --> 04:02:08.135
LAURA: Fjord! Fjord!

6156
04:02:08.135 --> 04:02:09.828
TRAVIS: I've come to collect!

6157
04:02:09.828 --> 04:02:11.247
LAURA: Everybody's out of the house.

6158
04:02:11.247 --> 04:02:13.161
Get away from the house.

6159
04:02:13.161 --> 04:02:15.769
Get back to--

6160
04:02:15.769 --> 04:02:17.294
Reani's house maybe,

6161
04:02:17.294 --> 04:02:19.022
I'm not sure where we're going,

6162
04:02:19.022 --> 04:02:21.879
but everybody's gone, just get away.

6163
04:02:21.879 --> 04:02:23.192
TRAVIS: Do I hear that?

6164
04:02:23.192 --> 04:02:25.226
MATT: I'd say you would probably backtrack enough.

6165
04:02:25.226 --> 04:02:26.457
SAM: Is that Message?

6166
04:02:26.457 --> 04:02:28.388
MATT: To leave the message, so sure.

6167
04:02:28.388 --> 04:02:30.325
TRAVIS: I'll come back for my money later.

6168
04:02:30.325 --> 04:02:32.542
(laughter)

6169
04:02:32.542 --> 04:02:33.812
MATT: Okay.

6170
04:02:33.812 --> 04:02:36.125
For the purposes of expediency on this,

6171
04:02:36.125 --> 04:02:40.391
you do manage to return to Reani's home to gather

6172
04:02:40.391 --> 04:02:44.644
safe and sound with the items you have recovered.

6173
04:02:44.644 --> 04:02:48.084
So, unless there's any other business,

6174
04:02:48.084 --> 04:02:51.401
you can go ahead and return this ring to Ava.

6175
04:02:51.401 --> 04:02:53.706
TALIESIN: I'd like to know what it is before we return it,
but other than that.

6176
04:02:53.706 --> 04:02:56.070
LAURA: Yeah, we should Identify the fuck out of this stuff.

6177
04:02:56.070 --> 04:02:57.803
MATT: Okay, so you're casting--

6178
04:02:57.803 --> 04:03:01.715
LIAM: Identify, ritually, on both the ring and the book.

6179
04:03:01.715 --> 04:03:03.656
MATT: All right, the ring--

6180
04:03:03.656 --> 04:03:05.594
TALIESIN: I'd like to know what the cost is.

6181
04:03:05.594 --> 04:03:06.427
LIAM: Yeah.

6182
04:03:08.326 --> 04:03:12.636
SAM: We have stolen valuable items from dangerous people

6183
04:03:12.636 --> 04:03:15.203
and things twice in a row now.

6184
04:03:15.203 --> 04:03:16.557
MARISHA: That went pretty well, actually.

6185
04:03:16.557 --> 04:03:18.923
SAM: Yeah, Reani, you are our good luck charm.

6186
04:03:18.923 --> 04:03:21.161
MARISHA: I think so.
MICA: Yay!

6187
04:03:21.161 --> 04:03:22.931
TRAVIS: Just trying to help.

6188
04:03:22.931 --> 04:03:24.513
LIAM: I know, darling.

6189
04:03:24.513 --> 04:03:26.459
LAURA: (laughs)

6190
04:03:26.459 --> 04:03:30.509
MATT: But you also have the iceflex,

6191
04:03:30.509 --> 04:03:33.901
and can begin to make your journey

6192
04:03:33.901 --> 04:03:38.684
with Umagorn towards the forge.

6193
04:03:38.684 --> 04:03:39.625
LAURA: Yeah!

6194
04:03:39.625 --> 04:03:40.798
MATT: So.

6195
04:03:40.798 --> 04:03:42.756
When you're ready for that, let me know.

6196
04:03:42.756 --> 04:03:44.335
Want to try and get to one moment tonight

6197
04:03:44.335 --> 04:03:47.334
so we can give you a proper exit

6198
04:03:47.334 --> 04:03:50.922
as well as hit a good narrative point, so,

6199
04:03:50.922 --> 04:03:52.810
hang tight for just a short time more, guys,

6200
04:03:52.810 --> 04:03:55.667
if you don't mind.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

6201
04:03:55.667 --> 04:03:59.942
LIAM: This ring is used to implant dreams

6202
04:03:59.942 --> 04:04:02.087
in someone's mind.

6203
04:04:02.087 --> 04:04:04.955
LAURA: Whoa, that's dark, and cool.

6204
04:04:04.955 --> 04:04:07.350
TALIESIN: Is there a top involved or--

6205
04:04:07.350 --> 04:04:09.570
SAM: That's cool.
LAURA: Implant dreams into someone's mind?

6206
04:04:09.570 --> 04:04:11.261
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool.

6207
04:04:11.261 --> 04:04:12.094
LIAM: Yeah.

6208
04:04:13.097 --> 04:04:14.996
Of your choosing.

6209
04:04:14.996 --> 04:04:17.591
Imagine if you could put a dream in someone's mind

6210
04:04:17.591 --> 04:04:19.993
to follow the Traveler.

6211
04:04:19.993 --> 04:04:21.227
LAURA: I mean, that'd be fucking cool.

6212
04:04:21.227 --> 04:04:22.060
LIAM: Yeah.

6213
04:04:22.060 --> 04:04:23.539
LAURA: How do we know that they haven't been

6214
04:04:23.539 --> 04:04:26.952
using those kinds of things on people already?

6215
04:04:26.952 --> 04:04:29.128
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Probably have.

6216
04:04:29.128 --> 04:04:31.178
SAM: In any case, giving this back to Ava

6217
04:04:31.178 --> 04:04:34.304
doesn't seem like such a bad thing.

6218
04:04:34.304 --> 04:04:35.184
LAURA: No.

6219
04:04:35.184 --> 04:04:37.525
TALIESIN: It's the path we're on, it's the path I'll walk.

6220
04:04:37.525 --> 04:04:40.670
SAM: It's not a world-breaking item.

6221
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:42.170
TALIESIN: I'm comfortable.

6222
04:04:43.812 --> 04:04:45.812
I'll make that exchange.

6223
04:04:46.775 --> 04:04:48.326
LAURA: Yeah, let's make our way back to Ava.

6224
04:04:48.326 --> 04:04:50.535
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

6225
04:04:50.535 --> 04:04:54.031
For the purposes of expediency as well,

6226
04:04:54.031 --> 04:04:56.975
Ava is extremely happy to make the trade

6227
04:04:56.975 --> 04:04:59.093
if the ring is presented.

6228
04:04:59.093 --> 04:05:01.823
She is excited and congratulates you

6229
04:05:01.823 --> 04:05:05.221
on this successful mission, and she gives a bit

6230
04:05:05.221 --> 04:05:09.186
of respect and surprise to you, Reani.

6231
04:05:09.186 --> 04:05:13.949
"But if you wouldn't mind, a trade is a trade, yes?"

6232
04:05:13.949 --> 04:05:16.258
TALIESIN: The whole box.

6233
04:05:16.258 --> 04:05:18.566
MATT: The entire box, friend.

6234
04:05:19.881 --> 04:05:21.093
LIAM: You feel good about this?

6235
04:05:21.093 --> 04:05:22.715
TALIESIN: I do.
LAURA: We need that.

6236
04:05:22.715 --> 04:05:24.518
We need that glass.

6237
04:05:24.518 --> 04:05:27.815
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I do feel good about this.

6238
04:05:27.815 --> 04:05:31.524
MATT: "Finally, home where you belong."

6239
04:05:31.524 --> 04:05:33.696
LAURA: Are you going to plant a bunch of dreams

6240
04:05:33.696 --> 04:05:35.926
in people's minds like crazy?

6241
04:05:35.926 --> 04:05:37.974
MATT: There's a moment of Ava's eyes

6242
04:05:37.974 --> 04:05:42.273
just shooting daggers at you and intent and goes,

6243
04:05:42.273 --> 04:05:44.762
(chuckles)

6244
04:05:44.762 --> 04:05:46.337
"I have plans.

6245
04:05:47.620 --> 04:05:50.254
"But here you are."

6246
04:05:50.254 --> 04:05:53.559
She hands over the box, which contains

6247
04:05:53.559 --> 04:05:55.906
a sizable amount of refined residuum glass.

6248
04:05:55.906 --> 04:05:58.226
TRAVIS: Oh!
LAURA: Yeah!

6249
04:05:58.226 --> 04:06:01.414
MARISHA: Can I get an idea if she's actually

6250
04:06:01.414 --> 04:06:04.220
just a normal old antiques collector?

6251
04:06:04.220 --> 04:06:06.042
TALIESIN: There's no such thing.
MATT: Make an insight check.

6252
04:06:06.042 --> 04:06:07.360
TALIESIN: Ever met one?

6253
04:06:07.360 --> 04:06:08.745
(laughter)

6254
04:06:08.745 --> 04:06:13.637
These are creatures beyond.

6255
04:06:16.224 --> 04:06:18.994
MARISHA: 17. Sorry 15, 15.

6256
04:06:18.994 --> 04:06:20.438
MATT: 15?

6257
04:06:20.438 --> 04:06:21.424
There's definitely a lot more going on

6258
04:06:21.424 --> 04:06:23.765
than just the surface, and you know,

6259
04:06:23.765 --> 04:06:26.714
strange trading post runner, but you can't ascertain

6260
04:06:26.714 --> 04:06:28.080
more beyond that.

6261
04:06:28.080 --> 04:06:33.080
Definitely a more tiered and involved persona.

6262
04:06:33.287 --> 04:06:35.444
TRAVIS: She's a demogorgon.

6263
04:06:35.444 --> 04:06:37.081
LAURA: You're not going to let anyone know

6264
04:06:37.081 --> 04:06:38.945
where you got that, right?

6265
04:06:38.945 --> 04:06:40.371
MATT: "Of course not.

6266
04:06:40.371 --> 04:06:41.898
"Do you think I have a successful business

6267
04:06:41.898 --> 04:06:45.481
"by providing information about my sources?

6268
04:06:45.481 --> 04:06:47.081
"You're fine."
LAURA: Okay.

6269
04:06:47.081 --> 04:06:50.533
MATT: "As long you won't tell anyone
where you gave this ring."

6270
04:06:50.533 --> 04:06:51.953
LAURA: Why would we do that?

6271
04:06:51.953 --> 04:06:53.543
MATT: "Precisely.

6272
04:06:53.543 --> 04:06:55.759
"Well, good luck, and...

6273
04:06:58.701 --> 04:07:00.534
I'm proud of you."

6274
04:07:00.534 --> 04:07:02.159
MICA: (shudders)

6275
04:07:03.106 --> 04:07:04.163
SAM: She likes you now.

6276
04:07:04.163 --> 04:07:04.996
MICA: (groans)

6277
04:07:04.996 --> 04:07:06.835
LAURA: Try to do a flower crown,
see if she wants a flower crown.

6278
04:07:06.835 --> 04:07:08.619
MICA: (gasps)

6279
04:07:08.619 --> 04:07:11.578
Quickly Druidcraft a flower crown
and slide it across the table.

6280
04:07:11.578 --> 04:07:15.240
MATT: She takes it and goes, "You've certainly helped

6281
04:07:15.240 --> 04:07:18.163
"hobble some bad folk."

6282
04:07:18.163 --> 04:07:19.663
MICA: (high-pitched noise and squeak)

6283
04:07:19.663 --> 04:07:22.096
TRAVIS: Wow.
TALIESIN: Worth it.

6284
04:07:22.096 --> 04:07:22.929
Entirely worth it.

6285
04:07:22.929 --> 04:07:24.478
MICA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Look at that.

6286
04:07:24.478 --> 04:07:26.999
SAM: I'll look at the imps. Are they surprised?

6287
04:07:26.999 --> 04:07:28.916
MATT: They're both going...

6288
04:07:32.050 --> 04:07:34.633
They're definitely surprised.

6289
04:07:34.633 --> 04:07:38.572
MICA: I look up at them, I'm like: You're next.

6290
04:07:38.572 --> 04:07:40.453
MATT: "Anyway, our business is concluded,

6291
04:07:40.453 --> 04:07:41.824
"unless you want something else."

6292
04:07:41.824 --> 04:07:43.240
TALIESIN: Oh, pleasure doing business with you.

6293
04:07:43.240 --> 04:07:44.965
MATT: "Then goodbye."

6294
04:07:46.611 --> 04:07:49.107
SAM: All right, so we'll hook up with Umagorn and make--

6295
04:07:49.107 --> 04:07:50.834
MATT: You notice on the way out, as soon as you guys leave,

6296
04:07:50.834 --> 04:07:53.561
the moment you're exiting, she takes the crown off.

6297
04:07:53.561 --> 04:07:54.781
(laughter)

6298
04:07:54.781 --> 04:07:59.280
All right, so, you gather Umagorn,

6299
04:07:59.280 --> 04:08:01.405
you gather your materials,

6300
04:08:02.271 --> 04:08:05.913
and you begin your two-day trek

6301
04:08:05.913 --> 04:08:10.510
to the Cinderrest Sanctum with the iceflex.

6302
04:08:10.510 --> 04:08:13.619
Upon which your arrival-- with the information

6303
04:08:13.619 --> 04:08:16.753
and the experience that you've had, you manage to avoid

6304
04:08:16.753 --> 04:08:20.494
marauding ice giant hunters,

6305
04:08:20.494 --> 04:08:24.626
amongst other dangers in the vicinity, until you come upon

6306
04:08:24.626 --> 04:08:27.579
the familiar mountain of Kravaraad.

6307
04:08:27.579 --> 04:08:31.235
Entering, the Dust family awaits you.

6308
04:08:31.235 --> 04:08:35.615
It seems that Ichabod, the father of the family,

6309
04:08:35.615 --> 04:08:38.449
has returned with his son.

6310
04:08:38.449 --> 04:08:40.463
Let me go ahead and prepare this element

6311
04:08:40.463 --> 04:08:44.546
of my notes here, as you've moved on to the next.

6312
04:08:46.015 --> 04:08:50.033
As well as Brumhelm, the youngest, who's like a young dwarf,

6313
04:08:50.033 --> 04:08:53.614
maybe in his teens, quiet and shy.

6314
04:08:55.497 --> 04:09:00.497
Umagorn asks for help from both

6315
04:09:00.497 --> 04:09:03.770
Khemdal, who is the keeper and maintainer

6316
04:09:03.770 --> 04:09:08.149
of the forge, as well as his assistant, Deilin,

6317
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:11.197
to help as well, and begins the process

6318
04:09:11.197 --> 04:09:14.004
of reforging the weapon.

6319
04:09:14.004 --> 04:09:17.645
The heat is immense, and the process--

6320
04:09:17.645 --> 04:09:21.015
Umagorn halfway, or even like 30 minutes in,

6321
04:09:21.015 --> 04:09:24.698
sweating, turns to you, going,

6322
04:09:24.698 --> 04:09:26.702
"This is going to take a while.

6323
04:09:26.702 --> 04:09:30.784
"Going over my notes, I've got some help.

6324
04:09:30.784 --> 04:09:34.247
"I'll probably need to work through the night.

6325
04:09:34.247 --> 04:09:37.129
"But I'm excited.

6326
04:09:37.129 --> 04:09:41.950
"I'm going to get this done, so don't mind me."

6327
04:09:41.950 --> 04:09:45.533
Ping, ping, and you watch

6328
04:09:45.533 --> 04:09:48.029
as the Underforge begins to glow,

6329
04:09:48.029 --> 04:09:52.136
and it seems that with the presence of this inspiration

6330
04:09:52.136 --> 04:09:54.209
to create, the fire and the magma

6331
04:09:54.209 --> 04:09:57.920
seems to intensify, burning brighter and hotter.

6332
04:09:57.920 --> 04:09:59.460
Not in a way that's uncomfortable,

6333
04:09:59.460 --> 04:10:02.142
but just it's an electric sensation,

6334
04:10:02.142 --> 04:10:04.036
like the forge itself is a living being

6335
04:10:04.036 --> 04:10:06.697
that is as excited for this as you are.

6336
04:10:06.697 --> 04:10:09.029
You have an evening's rest here,

6337
04:10:09.029 --> 04:10:11.529
within the Cinderrest Sanctum.

6338
04:10:14.305 --> 04:10:15.847
Is there anything that you'd like to do while you rest

6339
04:10:15.847 --> 04:10:17.205
or move on?

6340
04:10:17.205 --> 04:10:19.555
TALIESIN: I'm probably going to

6341
04:10:21.655 --> 04:10:26.522
meditate and have a quick

6342
04:10:26.522 --> 04:10:29.530
communion with the Wildmother

6343
04:10:29.530 --> 04:10:33.986
about precisely what is the ritual that I'm to enact.

6344
04:10:33.986 --> 04:10:35.377
MATT: Okay.

6345
04:10:36.291 --> 04:10:39.746
So you can finish your Commune, you burn your incense,

6346
04:10:39.746 --> 04:10:41.565
prepare and close your eyes.

6347
04:10:41.565 --> 04:10:43.903
You sense the warmth wash over you like a breeze

6348
04:10:43.903 --> 04:10:46.170
in the center of a summer day.

6349
04:10:46.170 --> 04:10:48.640
You sense her presence, you sense her smile,

6350
04:10:48.640 --> 04:10:51.212
and the images and emotions begin to fill you.

6351
04:10:51.212 --> 04:10:54.152
Wordless, but understandable.

6352
04:10:54.152 --> 04:10:56.127
What are your questions?

6353
04:11:00.233 --> 04:11:03.391
TALIESIN: Do you wish me to feed
just three of these into the--

6354
04:11:03.391 --> 04:11:06.549
into the magma?

6355
04:11:10.228 --> 04:11:13.719
MATT: You have four large pieces?

6356
04:11:13.719 --> 04:11:15.562
TALIESIN: Four or five, I believe.

6357
04:11:15.562 --> 04:11:18.144
MATT: I'd say it's like four and a half large pieces.

6358
04:11:18.144 --> 04:11:20.588
She says no.

6359
04:11:20.588 --> 04:11:22.867
TALIESIN: May I give you all of it?

6360
04:11:22.867 --> 04:11:24.108
MATT: "Yes."

6361
04:11:27.076 --> 04:11:30.170
TALIESIN: Thank you for taking care of him.

6362
04:11:32.486 --> 04:11:36.107
I remove my coat, just the things,

6363
04:11:36.107 --> 04:11:40.874
just wearing the things I wore when I was

6364
04:11:40.874 --> 04:11:44.526
working in the rove.

6365
04:11:45.408 --> 04:11:47.573
Quietly I find a quiet space

6366
04:11:47.573 --> 04:11:50.860
and I take everything in the box

6367
04:11:50.860 --> 04:11:53.483
and as close as I can get to the heat

6368
04:11:53.483 --> 04:11:55.381
before it really hurts, and I--

6369
04:11:55.381 --> 04:11:56.467
MATT: It hurts.

6370
04:11:56.467 --> 04:11:58.096
TALIESIN: Then I'll take a little damage.

6371
04:11:58.096 --> 04:11:59.724
MATT: Okay.

6372
04:11:59.724 --> 04:12:01.298
And you place them within?

6373
04:12:01.298 --> 04:12:02.668
TALIESIN: I do.

6374
04:12:02.668 --> 04:12:07.284
MATT: As the shards of refined residuum touch the flames,

6375
04:12:07.284 --> 04:12:10.309
you feel a fear well up inside you,

6376
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:13.931
almost like you're expecting the glass to begin to melt.

6377
04:12:13.931 --> 04:12:16.784
And most people would.

6378
04:12:16.784 --> 04:12:19.342
Instead, you watch as they almost begin to...

6379
04:12:20.409 --> 04:12:21.947
burn.

6380
04:12:21.947 --> 04:12:24.516
The flames beginning to catch around them.

6381
04:12:24.516 --> 04:12:26.951
Glass should not ignite, but flames do crawl

6382
04:12:26.951 --> 04:12:29.432
across their surface.

6383
04:12:29.432 --> 04:12:31.531
Burning brighter, the magma there.

6384
04:12:31.531 --> 04:12:35.247
Orange, yellow, white.

6385
04:12:36.214 --> 04:12:40.473
You have to almost wince, and about 15 minutes

6386
04:12:40.473 --> 04:12:42.178
of this intense heat causes you

6387
04:12:42.178 --> 04:12:46.137
to step back and just trust in the faith.

6388
04:12:48.936 --> 04:12:53.936
Then the light begins to subside, and they've changed a bit.

6389
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:58.060
The shape of them is less like a piece of glass

6390
04:12:58.060 --> 04:13:03.052
and more like a crystal that has grown roots.

6391
04:13:04.369 --> 04:13:07.540
The coloration which was once dark and green

6392
04:13:07.540 --> 04:13:10.699
now is purplish in hue.

6393
04:13:13.853 --> 04:13:15.871
It's beautiful.

6394
04:13:15.871 --> 04:13:17.653
Mysterious.

6395
04:13:17.653 --> 04:13:19.937
Definitely changed.

6396
04:13:19.937 --> 04:13:21.779
To what full nature, you don't understand,

6397
04:13:21.779 --> 04:13:26.720
but you remember the dream you had, the vision you had,

6398
04:13:28.208 --> 04:13:33.208
and a sense of peace and accomplishment washes over you.

6399
04:13:33.494 --> 04:13:34.813
TALIESIN: Can I grab it?

6400
04:13:34.813 --> 04:13:35.871
MATT: You can take a set of the tongs

6401
04:13:35.871 --> 04:13:36.704
from the edge of the forge

6402
04:13:36.704 --> 04:13:38.694
that aren't in use, and as you're doing this,

6403
04:13:38.694 --> 04:13:40.872
you can see three of them up there on the Underforge

6404
04:13:40.872 --> 04:13:44.980
in the process of taking the iceflex

6405
04:13:44.980 --> 04:13:47.400
and hammering it through and folding it and pressing it in,

6406
04:13:47.400 --> 04:13:49.718
and pushing the pieces together, and then refolding,

6407
04:13:49.718 --> 04:13:54.460
and re-engraving lost runes, and it's beautiful,

6408
04:13:54.460 --> 04:13:55.738
but they're so entranced by it.

6409
04:13:55.738 --> 04:13:57.951
There's like a weird energy that seems to be

6410
04:13:57.951 --> 04:14:01.278
driving them on past the point of a normal individual's

6411
04:14:01.278 --> 04:14:02.939
exhaustion would take them.

6412
04:14:02.939 --> 04:14:06.089
This forge seems to inherently

6413
04:14:06.089 --> 04:14:11.089
instill, energize, and provide the...

6414
04:14:11.346 --> 04:14:14.040
will to create great things.

6415
04:14:14.040 --> 04:14:16.930
As you take the tongs and release them one by one,

6416
04:14:16.930 --> 04:14:19.230
they are cool to the touch.

6417
04:14:20.995 --> 04:14:22.994
TALIESIN: I have five of them now?

6418
04:14:22.994 --> 04:14:23.997
Or just one.
MATT: Five.

6419
04:14:23.997 --> 04:14:27.491
There's four of them, and there's like a smaller one,

6420
04:14:27.491 --> 04:14:29.224
it's about half the size, but they were all transformed

6421
04:14:29.224 --> 04:14:30.557
in the same way.

6422
04:14:31.820 --> 04:14:34.834
Like a potato that's been left in the pantry too long

6423
04:14:34.834 --> 04:14:37.259
and has grown the various roots that stretch out,

6424
04:14:37.259 --> 04:14:38.802
but made of purple crystal.

6425
04:14:38.802 --> 04:14:42.492
TALIESIN: I'm going to gather them up and take them back

6426
04:14:42.492 --> 04:14:43.649
to the others.

6427
04:14:43.649 --> 04:14:46.602
LAURA: Magical old potatoes.

6428
04:14:46.602 --> 04:14:48.330
MATT: Does anyone else wish to do anything?

6429
04:14:48.330 --> 04:14:49.963
LIAM: Is it about midday at this point

6430
04:14:49.963 --> 04:14:51.595
after our shenanigans?

6431
04:14:51.595 --> 04:14:54.784
MATT: We'll say at this point it's getting close to night.

6432
04:14:54.784 --> 04:14:58.285
LIAM: Are businesses still open out there?

6433
04:14:58.285 --> 04:15:00.141
MATT: You guys are in the forge.

6434
04:15:00.141 --> 04:15:02.861
LIAM: Oh, we traveled out here?
MARISHA: We fast traveled.

6435
04:15:02.861 --> 04:15:05.063
LIAM: Sorry, I was reading all the shit.

6436
04:15:05.063 --> 04:15:08.958
MATT: No, I skipped ahead for the purposes of, you know--

6437
04:15:08.958 --> 04:15:10.022
not too much would've happened there anyway

6438
04:15:10.022 --> 04:15:12.004
and I want to get us to a point of--

6439
04:15:12.004 --> 04:15:14.435
LIAM: Could I retroactively have dived into--

6440
04:15:14.435 --> 04:15:17.192
kept an eye out for a paper store on the way out,

6441
04:15:17.192 --> 04:15:18.788
to get my supplies?
MATT: Sure.

6442
04:15:18.788 --> 04:15:22.565
Yeah, they have supplies, there are arcane practitioners.

6443
04:15:22.565 --> 04:15:23.554
LIAM: Okay, I don't want to drag us down

6444
04:15:23.554 --> 04:15:24.924
recreating that over and over again.

6445
04:15:24.924 --> 04:15:29.149
So then, forget that, I was reading, as I'm wont to do.

6446
04:15:29.149 --> 04:15:31.297
You seem frustrated.

6447
04:15:31.297 --> 04:15:33.038
(laughter)

6448
04:15:33.038 --> 04:15:34.079
Fjord.
TRAVIS: Me?

6449
04:15:34.079 --> 04:15:35.650
LIAM: Yeah.

6450
04:15:35.650 --> 04:15:37.170
You shouldn't, though, you know.

6451
04:15:37.170 --> 04:15:42.170
I get where you're at, you are figuring shit out.

6452
04:15:42.501 --> 04:15:44.546
You'll figure it out.

6453
04:15:44.546 --> 04:15:46.038
TRAVIS: Yeah, I hope so.

6454
04:15:47.113 --> 04:15:51.020
I'm not particularly frustrated, more curious.

6455
04:15:51.020 --> 04:15:56.020
Not impatient, either. I just want to be able to help

6456
04:15:56.145 --> 04:15:57.767
and not hinder.

6457
04:15:57.767 --> 04:15:59.240
LIAM: Yeah, it's very clear that you're feeling

6458
04:15:59.240 --> 04:16:01.485
a little less than, and I think that's foolish,

6459
04:16:01.485 --> 04:16:03.695
I don't think you need to.

6460
04:16:03.695 --> 04:16:06.326
I think you're going to find your way again.

6461
04:16:08.026 --> 04:16:10.431
Just give it some time.

6462
04:16:10.431 --> 04:16:13.106
You know, this book that we got is, uh...

6463
04:16:14.706 --> 04:16:17.241
it's not really my thing,

6464
04:16:17.241 --> 04:16:21.379
but you might find it interesting reading.

6465
04:16:21.379 --> 04:16:24.195
Take a look at it, and you know,

6466
04:16:24.195 --> 04:16:27.112
peruse the pages a bit, if it's not for you,

6467
04:16:27.112 --> 04:16:28.879
check with the rest of the group

6468
04:16:28.879 --> 04:16:31.282
and see if they'd like it, but I think

6469
04:16:31.282 --> 04:16:34.020
it's meant for you, perhaps.

6470
04:16:34.020 --> 04:16:36.038
TRAVIS: The book is?

6471
04:16:36.038 --> 04:16:38.941
LIAM: I hand it over to him, and then

6472
04:16:38.941 --> 04:16:43.941
I head off to start transcribing some spells.

6473
04:16:44.140 --> 04:16:46.261
MATT: All right.
LIAM: During all that.

6474
04:16:47.119 --> 04:16:48.194
TRAVIS: All right.

6475
04:16:51.903 --> 04:16:53.048
LIAM: That's it for me.

6476
04:16:53.048 --> 04:16:55.077
MATT: All right. Anyone else?

6477
04:16:55.077 --> 04:16:58.138
MARISHA: I got a bottle of whiskey in Bazzoxan

6478
04:16:58.138 --> 04:17:00.290
in case Nott flew off the handle,

6479
04:17:00.290 --> 04:17:03.047
that we haven't we touched, if anybody wants to,

6480
04:17:03.047 --> 04:17:05.423
you know, celebrate.

6481
04:17:05.423 --> 04:17:07.229
TALIESIN: I'll watch.

6482
04:17:07.229 --> 04:17:08.062
MICA: I'm in.

6483
04:17:09.550 --> 04:17:11.131
MARISHA: Jess?

6484
04:17:11.131 --> 04:17:11.964
Nott?

6485
04:17:11.964 --> 04:17:15.028
LAURA: Oh, I'll definitely sit there.

6486
04:17:15.028 --> 04:17:18.078
MARISHA: Not going to drink?
LAURA: Mm-mm.

6487
04:17:19.069 --> 04:17:21.187
MARISHA: You're drinking with me though, right?

6488
04:17:21.187 --> 04:17:23.409
Okay, thank god.

6489
04:17:23.409 --> 04:17:25.367
I don't want to be alone.

6490
04:17:25.367 --> 04:17:27.169
LAURA: You're not alone, Beau.

6491
04:17:27.169 --> 04:17:29.720
Even if I'm not drinking, I'm still here with you.

6492
04:17:29.720 --> 04:17:31.103
TALIESIN: I'm drinking with you in spirit.

6493
04:17:31.103 --> 04:17:35.010
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine, I take a big swing

6494
04:17:35.010 --> 04:17:36.197
and then hand it to Reani.

6495
04:17:36.197 --> 04:17:37.359
MICA: I take a big swig as well.

6496
04:17:37.359 --> 04:17:39.516
MARISHA: Yeah.

6497
04:17:39.516 --> 04:17:40.349
Yeah.

6498
04:17:42.905 --> 04:17:44.405
SAM: No, I'm fine.

6499
04:17:44.405 --> 04:17:46.905
TALIESIN: Wow. That's...

6500
04:17:48.486 --> 04:17:50.011
SAM: I mean, we're--

6501
04:17:50.011 --> 04:17:51.744
TALIESIN: No, it's just that's interesting.

6502
04:17:51.744 --> 04:17:52.734
Any particular reason?

6503
04:17:52.734 --> 04:17:55.811
Normally you're the first one to say yes.

6504
04:17:55.811 --> 04:17:58.527
Are you feeling fine?

6505
04:17:58.527 --> 04:18:00.675
SAM: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

6506
04:18:00.675 --> 04:18:03.162
LAURA: Just feeling so good, it's okay, she's fine.

6507
04:18:03.162 --> 04:18:06.098
TALIESIN: No, that's great, that's great.

6508
04:18:06.098 --> 04:18:08.471
That's great, I'm happy to hear that.

6509
04:18:08.471 --> 04:18:11.483
That's fantas-- I mean, to be fair, you did very well.

6510
04:18:11.483 --> 04:18:12.316
LAURA: You did really good.

6511
04:18:12.316 --> 04:18:14.311
SAM: Would've been better if I had that--

6512
04:18:14.311 --> 04:18:15.720
LAURA: No, you didn't need it, you know what,

6513
04:18:15.720 --> 04:18:17.174
we didn't get that wand and it's fine,

6514
04:18:17.174 --> 04:18:19.156
and it was fun to get out of there in a big rush.

6515
04:18:19.156 --> 04:18:21.493
It was a sign, we needed to get out.

6516
04:18:21.493 --> 04:18:23.684
SAM: Would've gotten that wand, but it's all right.
LAURA: Nope, we don't need it.

6517
04:18:23.684 --> 04:18:24.944
SAM: That's fine.

6518
04:18:24.944 --> 04:18:26.147
MICA: Are you sure you don't want a drink?

6519
04:18:26.147 --> 04:18:27.056
LAURA: (aggressively shushing)

6520
04:18:27.056 --> 04:18:29.922
MICA: Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

6521
04:18:29.922 --> 04:18:31.717
I just take another drink.

6522
04:18:31.717 --> 04:18:32.572
(laughter)

6523
04:18:32.572 --> 04:18:34.224
MARISHA: Pass it back, pass it back.

6524
04:18:34.224 --> 04:18:35.169
Yeah.

6525
04:18:35.169 --> 04:18:37.296
TALIESIN: I got an interesting idea.

6526
04:18:37.296 --> 04:18:40.415
Do you still have that note that we took from the house?

6527
04:18:40.415 --> 04:18:41.707
MARISHA: I do.

6528
04:18:41.707 --> 04:18:43.709
You want to play crosswords and shit?

6529
04:18:43.709 --> 04:18:45.754
TALIESIN: Well, I have an interesting idea.

6530
04:18:45.754 --> 04:18:47.670
I was trying to think of a good gift to give you

6531
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:50.196
for everything you've done for us.

6532
04:18:50.196 --> 04:18:51.412
Yeah, you.

6533
04:18:52.659 --> 04:18:54.303
MICA: I got it.

6534
04:18:54.303 --> 04:18:56.526
TALIESIN: You know what that note is?

6535
04:18:56.526 --> 04:18:57.431
SAM: What is it?

6536
04:18:57.431 --> 04:18:59.002
TALIESIN: That's a super villain.

6537
04:18:59.002 --> 04:19:01.502
MICA: (gasps)

6538
04:19:02.988 --> 04:19:05.264
MARISHA: I hand you the booze and the note.

6539
04:19:06.356 --> 04:19:08.711
Looks like they're smuggling something.

6540
04:19:08.711 --> 04:19:11.128
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

6541
04:19:12.063 --> 04:19:14.259
MICA: Oh, yay.
LAURA: Ooh.

6542
04:19:14.259 --> 04:19:15.307
MICA: 21.

6543
04:19:15.307 --> 04:19:16.971
MATT: 21.
TALIESIN: Sweet.

6544
04:19:16.971 --> 04:19:18.946
MATT: The initials I.J..

6545
04:19:18.946 --> 04:19:20.672
MICA: (gasps)

6546
04:19:20.672 --> 04:19:22.269
Oh!

6547
04:19:22.269 --> 04:19:23.680
Oh!

6548
04:19:23.680 --> 04:19:27.406
I didn't write it down, but that's the one asshole, right?

6549
04:19:27.406 --> 04:19:29.490
MATT: The J catches your attention.

6550
04:19:29.490 --> 04:19:30.409
MICA: Jagentoth?

6551
04:19:30.409 --> 04:19:31.242
MATT: Mm-hmm.

6552
04:19:31.242 --> 04:19:33.218
MARISHA: (gasping)

6553
04:19:33.218 --> 04:19:34.493
MICA: Fuck.

6554
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:36.857
Drunkenly I'm like--
TALIESIN: Fucking Jagentoth.

6555
04:19:36.857 --> 04:19:38.458
MARISHA: Fucking Jagentoths.

6556
04:19:38.458 --> 04:19:39.422
LAURA: Wait, what?

6557
04:19:39.422 --> 04:19:41.863
MICA: I know, I know--

6558
04:19:41.863 --> 04:19:43.361
SAM: What is that, what is that?

6559
04:19:43.361 --> 04:19:45.201
TRAVIS: They make computers.

6560
04:19:45.201 --> 04:19:47.433
MICA: They're so bad.

6561
04:19:47.433 --> 04:19:48.925
TALIESIN: Mackerel Jagentoth.

6562
04:19:48.925 --> 04:19:53.350
MICA: They're these mean as a family of criminals

6563
04:19:53.350 --> 04:19:55.831
and they've been terrorizing Uthodurn,

6564
04:19:55.831 --> 04:20:00.220
and they've been-- they've been roughing up the patrons,

6565
04:20:00.220 --> 04:20:02.171
and I've been fighting them.

6566
04:20:02.171 --> 04:20:04.099
MARISHA: Yeah, we've heard of the Jagentoths.

6567
04:20:04.099 --> 04:20:05.228
SAM: We have?
LAURA: We have?

6568
04:20:05.228 --> 04:20:06.491
MARISHA: Yeah.

6569
04:20:06.491 --> 04:20:10.270
I think they ran amok in Rosohna?

6570
04:20:10.270 --> 04:20:12.949
No, they've run amok, I've got it written down.

6571
04:20:12.949 --> 04:20:13.935
MATT: You've got it in your notes.

6572
04:20:13.935 --> 04:20:16.345
MARISHA: I know I do.
SAM: It's somewhere in those 84 pages.

6573
04:20:16.345 --> 04:20:18.479
MARISHA: It's in one of these books.

6574
04:20:18.479 --> 04:20:23.471
Hang on, was it all the way back in Zadash?

6575
04:20:24.973 --> 04:20:26.180
Give me a minute.

6576
04:20:26.180 --> 04:20:27.797
Give me a minute.

6577
04:20:27.797 --> 04:20:29.982
SAM: What do you know about them, Reani?

6578
04:20:29.982 --> 04:20:34.906
MICA: They-- they steal, and they-- they--

6579
04:20:34.906 --> 04:20:36.672
they terrorize people in Uthodurn.

6580
04:20:36.672 --> 04:20:38.296
These weren't the ones that brought back--

6581
04:20:38.296 --> 04:20:40.631
that go to the Savalirwoods, were they?

6582
04:20:40.631 --> 04:20:45.567
MATT: Well, they hail from somewhere south of there, yes.

6583
04:20:45.567 --> 04:20:47.390
LAURA: (gasping)
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on.

6584
04:20:47.390 --> 04:20:50.714
MATT: Not the ruins of Molaesmyr, but they do

6585
04:20:50.714 --> 04:20:52.373
occasionally attempt to--

6586
04:20:52.373 --> 04:20:54.227
MARISHA: Can I do a roll for this?

6587
04:20:54.227 --> 04:20:56.875
So I'm not searching through my notes.

6588
04:20:56.875 --> 04:20:59.483
MATT: Well, you're a member of the Cobalt Soul.

6589
04:20:59.483 --> 04:21:01.465
I was going to see if you wanted to find it

6590
04:21:01.465 --> 04:21:04.598
and have that epiphany, as the note taker.

6591
04:21:04.598 --> 04:21:06.479
MARISHA: I know it's in here, I know.

6592
04:21:06.479 --> 04:21:10.118
LAURA: God, that's so hard to find anything.

6593
04:21:10.118 --> 04:21:12.113
MATT: It was over a year ago.
SAM: Oh, I got it!

6594
04:21:12.113 --> 04:21:13.713
MARISHA: It was over a year ago?

6595
04:21:13.713 --> 04:21:17.573
SAM: It's Shadycreek Run, Jagentoths,

6596
04:21:17.573 --> 04:21:21.729
in some place called North Clover, the Savalirwood.

6597
04:21:21.729 --> 04:21:24.052
It's the cursed woods.

6598
04:21:24.052 --> 04:21:24.965
Slavers.

6599
04:21:24.965 --> 04:21:26.373
LAURA: They are slavers!

6600
04:21:26.373 --> 04:21:27.263
ALL: (shouting)

6601
04:21:27.263 --> 04:21:28.653
MARISHA: They were slavers!

6602
04:21:28.653 --> 04:21:31.053
LAURA: I knew they were slavers.

6603
04:21:31.053 --> 04:21:33.605
MARISHA: They fucked with Lorenzo and shit, right?

6604
04:21:33.605 --> 04:21:35.155
Didn't they work with him?

6605
04:21:35.155 --> 04:21:39.597
They were the rival family that hired Lorenzo

6606
04:21:39.597 --> 04:21:40.995
and the Iron Fucks.

6607
04:21:40.995 --> 04:21:41.828
MATT: Yep.

6608
04:21:41.828 --> 04:21:43.210
SAM: The Iron Shepherds.

6609
04:21:43.210 --> 04:21:44.860
MARISHA: The Iron Shepherds, that's right.

6610
04:21:44.860 --> 04:21:46.813
MATT: They were the ones that were shipping the relics,

6611
04:21:46.813 --> 04:21:49.688
including the first orb of Uk'otoa that you found.

6612
04:21:49.688 --> 04:21:50.760
MARISHA: That's right.

6613
04:21:50.760 --> 04:21:51.636
MATT: That was set in the--

6614
04:21:51.636 --> 04:21:55.741
LAURA: Oh, we really should've taken their other stuff.

6615
04:21:55.741 --> 04:21:57.170
We should've cleared them out.

6616
04:21:57.170 --> 04:21:59.785
TALIESIN: Hey, you got a super villain.

6617
04:21:59.785 --> 04:22:03.769
MICA: They want me so dead,

6618
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:05.994
but I'm going to fight 'em.

6619
04:22:05.994 --> 04:22:07.278
TALIESIN: And you've got proof now.

6620
04:22:07.278 --> 04:22:11.490
MICA: I have proof now, and I can track them.

6621
04:22:11.490 --> 04:22:13.091
Thank you.
TALIESIN: Hey.

6622
04:22:13.091 --> 04:22:15.476
MICA: Wait, will you give me one more present?

6623
04:22:15.476 --> 04:22:16.942
MARISHA: Yeah.

6624
04:22:16.942 --> 04:22:18.985
MICA: Will you come back to visit?

6625
04:22:18.985 --> 04:22:20.403
SAM: (sighs happily)

6626
04:22:20.403 --> 04:22:23.013
MARISHA: Yeah, why else do you think I spent 2000 gold

6627
04:22:23.013 --> 04:22:25.430
on that teleportation circle?

6628
04:22:27.446 --> 04:22:30.097
MICA: For books and stuff?

6629
04:22:30.097 --> 04:22:31.840
MARISHA: No, we like you.

6630
04:22:31.840 --> 04:22:34.030
LAURA: We like you a lot.
TALIESIN: Yeah, we do.

6631
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:35.996
MICA: You guys are the first family

6632
04:22:35.996 --> 04:22:37.506
I've had other than Landon.

6633
04:22:37.506 --> 04:22:39.939
Umi doesn't count because he's busy all the time,

6634
04:22:39.939 --> 04:22:42.518
and I'm busy all the time, and Fen doesn't count anymore,

6635
04:22:42.518 --> 04:22:45.285
but I like you guys.

6636
04:22:47.049 --> 04:22:48.549
LAURA: We like you, too.

6637
04:22:49.407 --> 04:22:51.065
MARISHA: Yeah.
MICA: Pinky promise?

6638
04:22:51.065 --> 04:22:53.466
LAURA: Pinky promise forever!

6639
04:22:53.466 --> 04:22:55.193
MICA: Yay.

6640
04:22:55.193 --> 04:22:56.026
Thanks.

6641
04:22:58.391 --> 04:23:01.060
Before all of them leave, I want to craft

6642
04:23:01.060 --> 04:23:02.870
new flower crowns for them.

6643
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:04.108
MARISHA: Aww.
MATT: Certainly.

6644
04:23:04.108 --> 04:23:05.879
MICA: I promised myself I wouldn't cry, you guys.

6645
04:23:05.879 --> 04:23:08.023
MARISHA: Aww.

6646
04:23:09.897 --> 04:23:10.730
No!

6647
04:23:10.730 --> 04:23:11.986
MICA: I know.

6648
04:23:11.986 --> 04:23:14.714
TALIESIN: I have one last thing I'd like to do with Caleb,

6649
04:23:14.714 --> 04:23:16.818
also, if you've got a second.

6650
04:23:16.818 --> 04:23:18.740
LIAM: You got to interrupt him.

6651
04:23:18.740 --> 04:23:20.490
TALIESIN: Do you have a moment?

6652
04:23:20.490 --> 04:23:22.827
LIAM: Uh--
SAM: He's playing Words With Friends.

6653
04:23:22.827 --> 04:23:25.077
(laughter)

6654
04:23:26.241 --> 04:23:27.746
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

6655
04:23:27.746 --> 04:23:30.365
TALIESIN: I show him the small purple crystal.

6656
04:23:30.365 --> 04:23:32.782
What's this look like to you?

6657
04:23:34.424 --> 04:23:35.757
What do you see?

6658
04:23:37.760 --> 04:23:42.350
LIAM: A crystal very similar in hue to you?

6659
04:23:42.350 --> 04:23:46.193
TALIESIN: Can you get any sense of it, what it might be?

6660
04:23:46.193 --> 04:23:47.497
MATT: Roll an arcana check.

6661
04:23:47.497 --> 04:23:48.330
LIAM: Yeah.

6662
04:23:51.218 --> 04:23:52.296
Balls.

6663
04:23:53.229 --> 04:23:54.295
13.

6664
04:23:56.085 --> 04:23:57.915
MATT: You have never encountered this.

6665
04:23:57.915 --> 04:24:00.340
The one thing about it that you do notice

6666
04:24:00.340 --> 04:24:04.630
as a transmutation wizard is that transmutation

6667
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:08.545
that happened there doesn't make sense.

6668
04:24:08.545 --> 04:24:13.545
Which means this might be a little out of your depth.

6669
04:24:13.676 --> 04:24:14.787
LIAM: Sorry.

6670
04:24:14.787 --> 04:24:17.204
TALIESIN: No, it's okay, that's an answer.

6671
04:24:17.204 --> 04:24:19.115
I think I know what it is anyway.

6672
04:24:19.115 --> 04:24:20.723
LIAM: What do you think?

6673
04:24:20.723 --> 04:24:24.731
TALIESIN: I think it's the head of a hero.

6674
04:24:26.114 --> 04:24:27.797
LIAM: Small.

6675
04:24:28.646 --> 04:24:29.764
TALIESIN: Aren't we all.

6676
04:24:29.764 --> 04:24:31.821
Or at least, aren't all of you.

6677
04:24:33.488 --> 04:24:36.081
I won't bother you again, good luck with that thing.

6678
04:24:36.081 --> 04:24:37.340
LIAM: All right, tall boy.

6679
04:24:37.340 --> 04:24:38.500
TALIESIN: (chuckles)

6680
04:24:38.500 --> 04:24:39.719
Bye Caleb.

6681
04:24:39.719 --> 04:24:41.312
TRAVIS: If Caleb-- sorry.

6682
04:24:41.312 --> 04:24:45.233
MATT: You do recall that there are two parts to that vision.

6683
04:24:45.233 --> 04:24:47.816
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Yes, I do.
MATT: Yeah.

6684
04:24:50.371 --> 04:24:54.993
TRAVIS: If Caleb gave me that book,
and it was a two-day travel

6685
04:24:54.993 --> 04:24:58.935
back to the kiln, could I say that I've spent

6686
04:24:58.935 --> 04:25:01.183
most of the trip reading it and trying to absorb

6687
04:25:01.183 --> 04:25:05.437
its contents, and you know, just spending time with it?

6688
04:25:05.437 --> 04:25:06.985
As part of an effort, not--

6689
04:25:06.985 --> 04:25:08.504
MATT: I could say you can begin to.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6690
04:25:08.504 --> 04:25:10.217
MATT: Because it takes a while to read through.

6691
04:25:10.217 --> 04:25:13.176
TRAVIS: I'm also not great at reading on horseback.

6692
04:25:13.176 --> 04:25:14.808
MATT: Yeah.

6693
04:25:14.808 --> 04:25:16.330
This would be goatback.

6694
04:25:16.330 --> 04:25:18.405
TRAVIS: Goatback, yes, even better.

6695
04:25:18.405 --> 04:25:19.750
MATT: Because you're going through the mountains.

6696
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:22.266
TRAVIS: Could I also try to take Beau up

6697
04:25:22.266 --> 04:25:26.741
on some of her morning exercises

6698
04:25:26.741 --> 04:25:27.824
on the way?

6699
04:25:27.824 --> 04:25:29.224
MATT: Sure.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6700
04:25:29.224 --> 04:25:31.270
MATT: (laughs)

6701
04:25:31.270 --> 04:25:33.130
TRAVIS: Does not go well in the beginning,

6702
04:25:33.130 --> 04:25:34.960
but the effort is what counts.

6703
04:25:34.960 --> 04:25:36.020
MARISHA: I don't want to make you puke.

6704
04:25:36.020 --> 04:25:37.196
You'll probably puke.

6705
04:25:37.196 --> 04:25:40.558
TRAVIS: Yeah, I puked.
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

6706
04:25:40.558 --> 04:25:45.558
TRAVIS: As I see Caduceus go off to perform his meditation,

6707
04:25:46.158 --> 04:25:47.850
I've seen him do that before.

6708
04:25:47.850 --> 04:25:50.780
I don't want to bother him.

6709
04:25:50.780 --> 04:25:54.305
Can I go off into my own corner

6710
04:25:54.305 --> 04:25:56.788
and try to trace

6711
04:25:56.788 --> 04:26:00.697
like a circle in the soil and...

6712
04:26:01.635 --> 04:26:04.688
MATT: Like on the outside of the sanctum?

6713
04:26:04.688 --> 04:26:08.847
TRAVIS: Yeah, just make my own little space, circle,

6714
04:26:08.847 --> 04:26:10.589
and sit in the soil, and--

6715
04:26:10.589 --> 04:26:12.711
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Try to--

6716
04:26:12.711 --> 04:26:16.061
MATT: The sun has set by this point, and it is cold,

6717
04:26:16.061 --> 04:26:18.903
so you need to bring some furs to bundle up a bit,

6718
04:26:18.903 --> 04:26:20.781
but you find similar to almost the first point

6719
04:26:20.781 --> 04:26:22.227
of communion that you made with Caduceus,

6720
04:26:22.227 --> 04:26:24.033
last time you were at the sanctum.

6721
04:26:24.033 --> 04:26:26.592
You can find a similar place, clear it out,

6722
04:26:26.592 --> 04:26:27.803
and attempt your own.

6723
04:26:27.803 --> 04:26:29.909
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

6724
04:26:29.909 --> 04:26:32.442
TRAVIS: And just silently try to

6725
04:26:32.442 --> 04:26:35.068
talk to the Wildmother,

6726
04:26:35.068 --> 04:26:36.840
if she's listening.

6727
04:26:36.840 --> 04:26:37.673
MATT: Okay.

6728
04:26:39.474 --> 04:26:42.893
You close your eyes and you think.

6729
04:26:42.893 --> 04:26:47.126
Thoughts, wishes, questions.

6730
04:26:52.249 --> 04:26:57.249
It's cold, you shiver a bit, and you yawn.

6731
04:27:01.676 --> 04:27:03.017
You focus,

6732
04:27:05.484 --> 04:27:07.926
and you get this strange sensation

6733
04:27:07.926 --> 04:27:12.243
like your body is floating,

6734
04:27:13.617 --> 04:27:15.464
like a sensory deprivation tank.

6735
04:27:15.464 --> 04:27:20.464
Your sense of physical self begins to just tingle and fade.

6736
04:27:20.683 --> 04:27:22.508
Eyes still closed.

6737
04:27:29.904 --> 04:27:34.862
You feel these feelings envelop you like a warm bath.

6738
04:27:36.490 --> 04:27:40.965
Your body floating atop a heated ocean and gentle waves.

6739
04:27:42.179 --> 04:27:46.561
Peace finds your mind with the familiar smells of salt

6740
04:27:46.561 --> 04:27:51.128
and brine, the sound of seagulls in the air around you.

6741
04:27:52.343 --> 04:27:55.843
Broken surf crashing on a shore somewhere.

6742
04:27:57.163 --> 04:27:58.763
You open your eyes,

6743
04:28:00.196 --> 04:28:03.062
and as opposed to the mountainside,

6744
04:28:03.062 --> 04:28:07.895
you're looking up at a clear blue sky, not a cloud around.

6745
04:28:11.276 --> 04:28:15.526
You try and focus, just blue, impossibly wide blue.

6746
04:28:19.292 --> 04:28:20.794
And you see something.

6747
04:28:20.794 --> 04:28:23.569
Is it a cloud or...?

6748
04:28:25.493 --> 04:28:26.910
It's a face.

6749
04:28:27.964 --> 04:28:32.874
The faint tracings of a face, eyes, and a nose, a mouth,

6750
04:28:32.874 --> 04:28:36.832
but on a scale that consumes the entire blue sky above you.

6751
04:28:36.832 --> 04:28:41.832
It's almost unsettling, but it's soft,

6752
04:28:41.981 --> 04:28:43.247
maternal.

6753
04:28:45.254 --> 04:28:47.759
It's like a trick of the eye, but there it is.

6754
04:28:49.459 --> 04:28:52.292
You swear you see it smile.

6755
04:28:53.438 --> 04:28:56.375
These feelings wash into your mind, your heart,

6756
04:28:56.375 --> 04:28:58.942
emotions and images conveying ideas

6757
04:28:58.942 --> 04:29:02.525
and communication wordlessly, as if to say,

6758
04:29:04.191 --> 04:29:07.049
"You have been lost,

6759
04:29:07.049 --> 04:29:09.923
"caught in a dark current,

6760
04:29:09.923 --> 04:29:11.539
"an undertow.

6761
04:29:13.424 --> 04:29:17.227
"These depths seed you with an alien wound,

6762
04:29:17.227 --> 04:29:22.227
"too deep to heal, and leave your mind a torrent.

6763
04:29:22.647 --> 04:29:27.647
"Fear, love, pursuit for self-worth.

6764
04:29:33.014 --> 04:29:37.981
"You found my gaze through chance, through deed.

6765
04:29:39.554 --> 04:29:41.145
"Through company.

6766
04:29:46.016 --> 04:29:48.674
"These waters are your home,

6767
04:29:50.358 --> 04:29:52.191
"and always have been.

6768
04:29:54.547 --> 04:29:59.547
"These waters are me, and I am them.

6769
04:29:59.567 --> 04:30:03.033
"I am the lands that rise from them,

6770
04:30:03.033 --> 04:30:05.533
"I am the trees that bind them,

6771
04:30:06.446 --> 04:30:09.029
"I am the beasts that keep them.

6772
04:30:11.278 --> 04:30:15.779
"This seed of darkness," and you look down,

6773
04:30:15.779 --> 04:30:19.796
and you can feel this black rock,

6774
04:30:19.796 --> 04:30:24.768
this coal that is chilled within your chest.

6775
04:30:27.206 --> 04:30:30.957
"This seed I cannot heal, but I can help you

6776
04:30:30.957 --> 04:30:32.840
"carry the burden.

6777
04:30:33.956 --> 04:30:37.157
"I can free you from the fiend that feeds,

6778
04:30:38.191 --> 04:30:42.765
"if you would but protect all that is me.

6779
04:30:45.861 --> 04:30:50.194
"Will you walk my lands, swim my shores,

6780
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:55.519
"and guide my children as one of my own?"

6781
04:30:58.251 --> 04:31:01.726
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, I would.

6782
04:31:04.634 --> 04:31:06.600
MATT: The smile widens.

6783
04:31:07.905 --> 04:31:12.230
"Then embrace me, my boon is yours.

6784
04:31:13.223 --> 04:31:15.390
"It is our nature to adapt.

6785
04:31:16.507 --> 04:31:19.398
"Come," and you feel tendrils

6786
04:31:19.398 --> 04:31:21.856
of kelp and seaweed

6787
04:31:21.856 --> 04:31:24.028
begin to rise from the warm water beneath you,

6788
04:31:24.028 --> 04:31:29.028
and wrap around you, and tie, and bind,

6789
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:32.076
and your heart rate begins to jump.

6790
04:31:32.076 --> 04:31:35.755
They're still warm, but it's beginning to cut the light off

6791
04:31:35.755 --> 04:31:39.813
as your face begins to be blanketed,

6792
04:31:40.920 --> 04:31:43.621
and you feel yourself being pulled beneath the waters.

6793
04:31:44.913 --> 04:31:46.246
Do you struggle?

6794
04:31:48.609 --> 04:31:50.042
TRAVIS: No.

6795
04:31:58.797 --> 04:32:00.163
MATT: Anyone else wish to do anything?

6796
04:32:00.163 --> 04:32:01.573
SAM: Oh!

6797
04:32:01.573 --> 04:32:03.179
LIAM: Surprise, motherfucker.
LAURA: Oh fuck.

6798
04:32:03.179 --> 04:32:04.024
MARISHA: What do you mean?

6799
04:32:04.024 --> 04:32:06.550
LAURA: It's like Uk'otoa in disguise.

6800
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:11.380
Yes. I'm going to find Reani.
MICA: Oh.

6801
04:32:11.380 --> 04:32:12.213
LAURA: And--

6802
04:32:12.213 --> 04:32:14.301
MATT: Reani is drinking with Beauregard.

6803
04:32:14.301 --> 04:32:15.783
MICA: Yes.
MATT: They're both a little tipsy.

6804
04:32:15.783 --> 04:32:18.328
MARISHA: You changed your mind!

6805
04:32:18.328 --> 04:32:19.656
LAURA: No.
MARISHA: Oh.

6806
04:32:19.656 --> 04:32:22.918
LAURA: But I've written a little note in my colored inks

6807
04:32:22.918 --> 04:32:26.296
that my mama gave me, and I drew Reani a picture,

6808
04:32:26.296 --> 04:32:28.129
and my note says,

6809
04:32:30.004 --> 04:32:32.187
"Life is all about balance.

6810
04:32:33.451 --> 04:32:36.214
"You can't live in black and white.

6811
04:32:36.214 --> 04:32:39.033
"Everything is a beautiful color of gray.

6812
04:32:40.250 --> 04:32:41.583
"Trust yourself.

6813
04:32:42.443 --> 04:32:44.119
"You know what is good.

6814
04:32:44.969 --> 04:32:47.785
"Love, Jester and the Traveler."

6815
04:32:47.785 --> 04:32:50.175
I'm going to put that note inside my book

6816
04:32:50.175 --> 04:32:53.827
of pastry recipes that I bought,

6817
04:32:53.827 --> 04:32:55.480
and I'm going to give it to Reani,

6818
04:32:55.480 --> 04:32:57.379
because I know you love how to cook and bake

6819
04:32:57.379 --> 04:32:59.201
and all of the wonderful things.

6820
04:32:59.201 --> 04:33:03.542
MICA: Tipsily, I shove it into my belt.

6821
04:33:04.435 --> 04:33:06.145
Thank you.

6822
04:33:06.145 --> 04:33:07.526
LAURA: You're welcome.

6823
04:33:07.526 --> 04:33:09.969
MICA: Then I have one last thing that I want to do.

6824
04:33:09.969 --> 04:33:12.439
Bolstered by a little bit of whiskey,

6825
04:33:12.439 --> 04:33:16.316
I want to shuffle over to Beau, and I want to like--

6826
04:33:18.683 --> 04:33:21.066
reminiscent of hot boy Essek--

6827
04:33:21.066 --> 04:33:22.328
looking down at the floor,

6828
04:33:22.328 --> 04:33:25.762
I just want to Druidcraft a little rose,

6829
04:33:25.762 --> 04:33:28.896
and I'll slide it over, like, I'm not--

6830
04:33:30.370 --> 04:33:31.462
I'm not good at this,

6831
04:33:31.462 --> 04:33:34.119
but you said that you wanted to come back and visit,

6832
04:33:34.119 --> 04:33:36.384
and you spent a lot of money to come see me,

6833
04:33:36.384 --> 04:33:38.398
(quietly) so I thought that I--

6834
04:33:38.398 --> 04:33:39.935
MARISHA: (loudly) What?

6835
04:33:39.935 --> 04:33:44.309
MICA: You said-- (gasps) (exhales)

6836
04:33:44.309 --> 04:33:46.392
(squeakily) You spent money so you could

6837
04:33:46.392 --> 04:33:49.433
come back and see me.

6838
04:33:49.433 --> 04:33:51.947
And I'm not good at this, but...

6839
04:33:53.330 --> 04:33:54.868
I think you're pretty.

6840
04:33:54.868 --> 04:33:56.823
MARISHA: I grab the back of her neck and I kiss her.

6841
04:33:56.823 --> 04:33:59.073
ALL: (exclaiming)

6842
04:34:02.704 --> 04:34:04.889
MICA: Reani definitely responds.

6843
04:34:04.889 --> 04:34:05.841
(laughter)

6844
04:34:05.841 --> 04:34:08.355
MICA: Very drunkenly, and is super happy.

6845
04:34:08.355 --> 04:34:10.605
(laughter)

6846
04:34:11.903 --> 04:34:13.939
MARISHA: Just kind of look over at Jester.

6847
04:34:13.939 --> 04:34:15.648
LAURA: I'm out, I was just--

6848
04:34:15.648 --> 04:34:17.606
TALIESIN: I'm the only one watching this right now.

6849
04:34:17.606 --> 04:34:20.149
I think Nott and I are watching this at this point.

6850
04:34:20.149 --> 04:34:22.374
LAURA: All of us are in this room.

6851
04:34:23.926 --> 04:34:25.721
Yeah, we'll give you some privacy.

6852
04:34:25.721 --> 04:34:27.378
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: We'll turn away.

6853
04:34:27.378 --> 04:34:29.088
LAURA: No, we'll get out of the room.

6854
04:34:29.088 --> 04:34:30.634
MARISHA: We'll take a walk.

6855
04:34:30.634 --> 04:34:31.644
MICA: We'll take a walk.

6856
04:34:31.644 --> 04:34:33.212
SAM: I'll turn invisible.

6857
04:34:33.212 --> 04:34:35.129
(laughter)

6858
04:34:36.382 --> 04:34:37.931
TALIESIN: Everywhere we go. How does she do that?

6859
04:34:37.931 --> 04:34:39.435
Everywhere we go.

6860
04:34:39.435 --> 04:34:40.419
MATT: All right.

6861
04:34:40.419 --> 04:34:42.429
LAURA: She gets so much action.
TALIESIN: I know, she's just--

6862
04:34:42.429 --> 04:34:44.882
LAURA: Like, my mama could learn something from Beau.

6863
04:34:44.882 --> 04:34:46.692
(laughter)

6864
04:34:46.692 --> 04:34:48.376
MATT: All right, you guys go ahead and take a walk.

6865
04:34:48.376 --> 04:34:50.042
MARISHA: I just grab Reani by the hip,

6866
04:34:50.042 --> 04:34:51.842
pull her in as we walk away.

6867
04:34:51.842 --> 04:34:54.183
MICA: Like a drunken sorority girl, I'm like yay.

6868
04:34:54.183 --> 04:34:57.321
(laughter)

6869
04:34:57.321 --> 04:34:59.136
MICA: Hobbling, stumbling.

6870
04:34:59.136 --> 04:35:00.219
MATT: Okay.

6871
04:35:02.314 --> 04:35:03.981
Anything else, guys?

6872
04:35:06.073 --> 04:35:07.214
TALIESIN: What else is there to say?

6873
04:35:07.214 --> 04:35:09.383
LIAM: Sure, I got a little minor thing.

6874
04:35:09.383 --> 04:35:14.374
Exhausted from transcribing and studying all day.

6875
04:35:16.439 --> 04:35:17.400
Have a seat.

6876
04:35:17.400 --> 04:35:18.510
SAM: Me?
LIAM: Yeah, have a seat.

6877
04:35:18.510 --> 04:35:19.769
SAM: What?

6878
04:35:19.769 --> 04:35:21.998
LIAM: I know you're in here, I saw you bamf out.

6879
04:35:21.998 --> 04:35:23.282
SAM: Yeah, I'm right here.
LIAM: Sit down.

6880
04:35:23.282 --> 04:35:24.407
SAM: I'm right here.

6881
04:35:24.407 --> 04:35:27.264
LIAM: Yeah, you're talking at me, I know you're right there.

6882
04:35:28.397 --> 04:35:31.862
You have not been drinking so much the last couple days.

6883
04:35:31.862 --> 04:35:34.156
SAM: That's not-- I mean, we've been traveling.

6884
04:35:34.156 --> 04:35:34.989
LIAM: Yeah?

6885
04:35:34.989 --> 04:35:35.822
SAM: Yeah.

6886
04:35:35.822 --> 04:35:37.559
LIAM: Yeah, I watch you sometimes.

6887
04:35:37.559 --> 04:35:39.205
You're drinking less.

6888
04:35:39.205 --> 04:35:41.923
SAM: Yeah, just the last couple days, not a thing, though.

6889
04:35:41.923 --> 04:35:44.273
We just haven't been in a fight.

6890
04:35:47.930 --> 04:35:51.430
LIAM: Maybe it's okay if you're drinking less.

6891
04:35:52.952 --> 04:35:56.312
Maybe it's okay if you are, but maybe it's okay if you stop,

6892
04:35:56.312 --> 04:35:57.734
or drink less.

6893
04:35:58.951 --> 04:36:01.698
SAM: Are we having this conversation right now?

6894
04:36:01.698 --> 04:36:03.139
Listen, I--

6895
04:36:04.773 --> 04:36:05.814
(sighs)

6896
04:36:09.315 --> 04:36:10.573
All right.

6897
04:36:10.573 --> 04:36:13.256
LIAM: Your family is safe.

6898
04:36:13.256 --> 04:36:16.669
You're with people who care about you.

6899
04:36:16.669 --> 04:36:18.448
You're alive.

6900
04:36:18.448 --> 04:36:22.392
Some fucker is not, where we came from.

6901
04:36:22.392 --> 04:36:27.392
And you know, you work fine when you have not had a drink,

6902
04:36:27.872 --> 04:36:32.471
and I understand why you're escaping into it.

6903
04:36:32.471 --> 04:36:33.554
I understand.

6904
04:36:34.781 --> 04:36:36.768
SAM: I don't know if you do.

6905
04:36:36.768 --> 04:36:38.926
I mean, I appreciate your sentiment,

6906
04:36:38.926 --> 04:36:41.171
and, you know, Jester's talked to me about this,

6907
04:36:41.171 --> 04:36:43.869
and Fjord's talked to me about this.

6908
04:36:43.869 --> 04:36:45.385
I think--

6909
04:36:47.335 --> 04:36:50.223
I don't want to burden you with my problems,

6910
04:36:50.223 --> 04:36:52.398
but for me--

6911
04:36:54.223 --> 04:36:58.161
listen, I view myself as,

6912
04:36:58.161 --> 04:37:00.321
whether you want it or not, I view myself

6913
04:37:00.321 --> 04:37:05.021
as a bit of a protector to you,

6914
04:37:05.021 --> 04:37:06.379
and in all honesty,

6915
04:37:06.379 --> 04:37:10.366
to the others, too, as we've gotten closer, and...

6916
04:37:12.804 --> 04:37:16.079
well, for a long time, when we were traveling together,

6917
04:37:16.079 --> 04:37:19.624
I sort of viewed myself as your shield.

6918
04:37:21.141 --> 04:37:24.282
I protected you so that you could go on your journey

6919
04:37:24.282 --> 04:37:29.070
and find yourself and fulfill your quest.

6920
04:37:29.070 --> 04:37:32.736
I feel like I've got to do that for everyone now,

6921
04:37:32.736 --> 04:37:34.594
because, I don't know, deep down inside,

6922
04:37:34.594 --> 04:37:36.837
it feels like my quest might not be done

6923
04:37:36.837 --> 04:37:40.861
until everyone else has figured out who they are

6924
04:37:40.861 --> 04:37:42.522
and what they want in this world.

6925
04:37:42.522 --> 04:37:45.516
Everyone's seeking something, you know?

6926
04:37:45.516 --> 04:37:49.329
So I feel like I need to be there to protect you all,

6927
04:37:49.329 --> 04:37:54.107
to rescue you when there's a dragon about to kill you

6928
04:37:54.107 --> 04:37:57.734
and use my body as a shield, or to pull Beauregard

6929
04:37:57.734 --> 04:38:02.510
out of the mouth of a worm, or to catch you

6930
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:06.311
when someone falls with a Featherfall spell.

6931
04:38:06.311 --> 04:38:09.210
But here's the thing:

6932
04:38:09.210 --> 04:38:12.527
it's really scary to do all those things,

6933
04:38:12.527 --> 04:38:14.036
and to go out in the front,

6934
04:38:14.036 --> 04:38:17.183
and to look for traps, and to disarm things,

6935
04:38:17.183 --> 04:38:20.902
and to scout ahead and steal things from terrible lairs,

6936
04:38:20.902 --> 04:38:24.410
and it's scary, and I don't--

6937
04:38:25.594 --> 04:38:26.710
I don't have--

6938
04:38:26.710 --> 04:38:28.785
I know you all have my back.

6939
04:38:28.785 --> 04:38:30.861
I know you all care for me.

6940
04:38:30.861 --> 04:38:32.953
But no one has my front.

6941
04:38:34.761 --> 04:38:39.761
So this flask that I drink from,

6942
04:38:40.369 --> 04:38:42.394
it's not for fun.

6943
04:38:42.394 --> 04:38:46.923
I'm not taking nips because I'm looking for fun.

6944
04:38:47.962 --> 04:38:51.626
If I wanted fun, I'd be in Nicodranas with my family.

6945
04:38:51.626 --> 04:38:54.167
This flask is <i>my</i> shield.

6946
04:38:54.167 --> 04:38:57.217
It allows me to do these things.

6947
04:38:57.217 --> 04:39:01.342
To go forward, and to protect all of you.

6948
04:39:01.342 --> 04:39:04.725
And I'm fine giving it up,

6949
04:39:05.742 --> 04:39:07.450
as long as you people

6950
04:39:07.450 --> 04:39:09.618
can find me something else that can protect me

6951
04:39:09.618 --> 04:39:11.768
as much as it does.

6952
04:39:16.266 --> 04:39:19.574
LIAM: How can you protect us

6953
04:39:19.574 --> 04:39:22.074
if you are not protecting yourself?

6954
04:39:24.777 --> 04:39:27.360
SAM: There's a bit of a trade-off.

6955
04:39:28.309 --> 04:39:29.192
But...

6956
04:39:31.975 --> 04:39:35.373
I just worry that I won't be able--

6957
04:39:35.373 --> 04:39:39.373
I won't be brave without it.

6958
04:39:42.236 --> 04:39:44.951
LIAM: You don't have to be brave alone.

6959
04:39:44.951 --> 04:39:49.251
I am not, without you, Nott.

6960
04:39:51.201 --> 04:39:55.630
I've been traveling with you for a long time for a reason.

6961
04:39:55.630 --> 04:39:58.477
These people are traveling with you for a reason.

6962
04:39:58.477 --> 04:40:00.866
You're not alone, and what I am asking you to do,

6963
04:40:00.866 --> 04:40:03.099
even though I cannot see you,

6964
04:40:04.566 --> 04:40:06.282
is to trust us.

6965
04:40:08.781 --> 04:40:12.489
And we will trust you even more

6966
04:40:14.718 --> 04:40:16.785
if you have that kind of faith in the group.

6967
04:40:16.785 --> 04:40:20.285
Listen, I don't have faith in much at all.

6968
04:40:22.640 --> 04:40:25.962
I don't have faith in myself either,

6969
04:40:25.962 --> 04:40:28.795
but I do have faith in this group.

6970
04:40:31.130 --> 04:40:33.992
It's a closed circle, and I just don't want

6971
04:40:33.992 --> 04:40:37.058
one of the links in the chain to shatter, you know?

6972
04:40:37.058 --> 04:40:39.887
And I'm a terrible person to judge anyone,

6973
04:40:39.887 --> 04:40:41.970
and I am not judging you.

6974
04:40:44.520 --> 04:40:47.143
I just have seen what you can do,

6975
04:40:47.143 --> 04:40:48.386
and I know it has nothing to do with

6976
04:40:48.386 --> 04:40:50.558
what is in that flask of yours.

6977
04:40:51.783 --> 04:40:53.340
Take that for what it's worth.

6978
04:40:53.340 --> 04:40:56.097
If you are swirling booze tomorrow,

6979
04:40:56.097 --> 04:41:00.180
I will still be your best friend and be with you.

6980
04:41:01.102 --> 04:41:06.097
But I'll probably be scrambling one less time a day,

6981
04:41:06.097 --> 04:41:07.488
you know?

6982
04:41:09.436 --> 04:41:11.686
Maybe it'll take some time.

6983
04:41:14.542 --> 04:41:15.883
SAM: I appreciate it.

6984
04:41:15.883 --> 04:41:19.383
LIAM: I really wish I could see you right now.

6985
04:41:22.153 --> 04:41:25.261
SAM: Yeah, I don't know.

6986
04:41:29.159 --> 04:41:30.342
<i>I</i> don't.

6987
04:41:32.514 --> 04:41:35.264
LIAM: Well, I understand, I get that.

6988
04:41:37.438 --> 04:41:40.771
SAM: I'll think about what you said, but...

6989
04:41:44.857 --> 04:41:45.848
I don't--

6990
04:41:48.970 --> 04:41:51.803
I'll think about what you've said.

6991
04:41:54.443 --> 04:41:57.201
And I'm sorry if I disappoint you again.

6992
04:42:02.935 --> 04:42:04.352
LIAM: Nott the Brave.

6993
04:42:07.637 --> 04:42:09.878
Maybe we both are messes,

6994
04:42:12.091 --> 04:42:14.900
but at least we're messes together.

6995
04:42:20.014 --> 04:42:21.449
SAM: While he can't see me, I'm going to take

6996
04:42:21.449 --> 04:42:24.840
a small sip of whiskey,

6997
04:42:24.840 --> 04:42:27.515
and slowly wipe my mouth,

6998
04:42:28.546 --> 04:42:31.737
and then say,

6999
04:42:36.379 --> 04:42:38.337
I'll try to make you proud.

7000
04:42:41.326 --> 04:42:42.743
LIAM: You already do.

7001
04:42:47.342 --> 04:42:49.148
LAURA: Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Hmm?

7002
04:42:49.148 --> 04:42:51.440
LAURA: I think Caleb is going crazy.

7003
04:42:54.649 --> 04:42:59.075
TALIESIN: I just rolled a 28 perception, 27 perception roll.

7004
04:42:59.075 --> 04:42:59.908
MATT: Mm-hmm.

7005
04:43:01.071 --> 04:43:06.046
TALIESIN: Would I have known that Caleb was talking to Nott?

7006
04:43:07.730 --> 04:43:09.647
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

7007
04:43:11.231 --> 04:43:13.667
SAM: My voice is still able to be heard.

7008
04:43:13.667 --> 04:43:14.696
(laughter)

7009
04:43:14.696 --> 04:43:15.999
MATT: You're not in the same chamber, right?

7010
04:43:15.999 --> 04:43:17.739
TALIESIN: No, no, they're-- just watching, though.

7011
04:43:17.739 --> 04:43:19.087
LAURA: Yeah, we're just watching.

7012
04:43:19.087 --> 04:43:21.192
TALIESIN: We were far enough away I wouldn't have heard you.

7013
04:43:21.192 --> 04:43:22.877
MATT: You guys have different rooms in the sanctum.

7014
04:43:22.877 --> 04:43:25.580
LIAM: Yeah, I'm sorry, I had assumed it was private time.

7015
04:43:25.580 --> 04:43:27.041
MATT: I assumed it was, too.

7016
04:43:27.041 --> 04:43:30.020
I assumed it was, too.

7017
04:43:30.020 --> 04:43:32.591
I would say that you could maybe have heard Caleb talking

7018
04:43:32.591 --> 04:43:34.459
and like, maybe looked in and saw nothing,

7019
04:43:34.459 --> 04:43:37.242
I would say that you probably--

7020
04:43:37.242 --> 04:43:38.700
TALIESIN: I've been trying to sit and listen

7021
04:43:38.700 --> 04:43:41.033
as much as possible, it's kind of my--

7022
04:43:41.033 --> 04:43:42.866
but yeah-- I just rolled something

7023
04:43:42.866 --> 04:43:44.758
because I was curious what my perception might've been.

7024
04:43:44.758 --> 04:43:46.957
MATT: You gather there's probably a conversation going on,

7025
04:43:46.957 --> 04:43:48.273
but you haven't looked.

7026
04:43:48.273 --> 04:43:50.900
TALIESIN: You think Caleb's going crazy.

7027
04:43:50.900 --> 04:43:51.733
LAURA: Yeah.

7028
04:43:53.513 --> 04:43:54.346
TALIESIN: Why?

7029
04:43:55.689 --> 04:43:58.422
LAURA: Oh, because he's just talking to himself so much.

7030
04:43:58.422 --> 04:44:01.563
TALIESIN: I think he's talking to Nott.

7031
04:44:01.563 --> 04:44:04.863
LAURA: Oh, that makes so much more sense.

7032
04:44:05.853 --> 04:44:06.962
TALIESIN: You okay?

7033
04:44:06.962 --> 04:44:08.470
LAURA: Me?
TALIESIN: Yeah, you.

7034
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:11.145
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'm fine.

7035
04:44:12.346 --> 04:44:13.679
I'm always fine.

7036
04:44:14.567 --> 04:44:15.983
TALIESIN: Well...

7037
04:44:17.508 --> 04:44:19.517
nobody's always fine.

7038
04:44:19.517 --> 04:44:21.600
LAURA: That's a lie, Caduceus.

7039
04:44:23.391 --> 04:44:25.311
TALIESIN: You do a lot.
LAURA: Yeah.

7040
04:44:25.311 --> 04:44:27.819
TALIESIN: I don't think you necessarily get as much credit

7041
04:44:27.819 --> 04:44:30.692
as you deserve, as often as you should.

7042
04:44:31.609 --> 04:44:35.024
You deserve more pastries.

7043
04:44:35.024 --> 04:44:36.670
LAURA: (laughs)

7044
04:44:36.670 --> 04:44:38.813
Everybody deserves more pastries.

7045
04:44:38.813 --> 04:44:40.396
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you do.

7046
04:44:42.992 --> 04:44:45.357
LAURA: Thanks, Caduceus.

7047
04:44:45.357 --> 04:44:46.540
TALIESIN: We'll be figuring out your

7048
04:44:46.540 --> 04:44:48.245
Traveler Con soon enough.

7049
04:44:48.245 --> 04:44:49.605
LAURA: Yeah, we're going to work it out.

7050
04:44:49.605 --> 04:44:51.205
It's going to be really cool, right?

7051
04:44:51.205 --> 04:44:52.609
TALIESIN: You got a good crew for it, so.

7052
04:44:52.609 --> 04:44:54.115
LAURA: Yeah.

7053
04:44:54.115 --> 04:44:55.533
TALIESIN: We're here for you.

7054
04:44:55.533 --> 04:44:56.667
LAURA: Thank you.

7055
04:44:56.667 --> 04:44:57.892
TALIESIN: Thank <i>you</i>.

7056
04:44:59.553 --> 04:45:04.103
I don't even know how to tell you what this has meant.

7057
04:45:07.187 --> 04:45:10.931
I don't know, he is looking a little weird though, isn't he?

7058
04:45:10.931 --> 04:45:12.039
LAURA: Yeah.

7059
04:45:12.039 --> 04:45:14.440
TALIESIN: It's a nice coat, though.

7060
04:45:14.440 --> 04:45:16.354
LAURA: He's looking so clean lately.

7061
04:45:16.354 --> 04:45:17.187
TALIESIN: Yeah.

7062
04:45:18.573 --> 04:45:19.406
Hmm.

7063
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:24.956
We really out of cupcakes?

7064
04:45:24.956 --> 04:45:26.439
LAURA: Oh, no, no, I have some in my bag.

7065
04:45:26.439 --> 04:45:27.689
TALIESIN: Okay.

7066
04:45:30.239 --> 04:45:32.299
MATT: Eventually you find yourself in comfort

7067
04:45:32.299 --> 04:45:35.828
in your own evening space, and as you're walking back,

7068
04:45:35.828 --> 04:45:38.893
a familiar voice comes to you and says,

7069
04:45:38.893 --> 04:45:41.342
"He's right, you know.

7070
04:45:41.342 --> 04:45:44.207
"You deserve all the cupcakes, Jester."

7071
04:45:44.207 --> 04:45:46.457
LAURA: (laughs)

7072
04:45:47.685 --> 04:45:49.109
Thank you.

7073
04:45:49.109 --> 04:45:52.017
MATT: "No, thank you."

7074
04:45:54.637 --> 04:45:56.076
LAURA: I left a dick.

7075
04:45:56.076 --> 04:45:57.247
SAM: (laughs)

7076
04:45:57.247 --> 04:46:00.961
LAURA: In lots of places, and your figure is taunting

7077
04:46:00.961 --> 04:46:03.083
a big ancient white dragon.

7078
04:46:03.083 --> 04:46:05.928
MATT: "(laughs)

7079
04:46:05.928 --> 04:46:07.795
"Never been more proud."

7080
04:46:07.795 --> 04:46:09.878
LAURA: (laughs)

7081
04:46:13.634 --> 04:46:17.300
MATT: Eventually, sleep comes to you all, in various...

7082
04:46:18.267 --> 04:46:19.100
ways.

7083
04:46:23.415 --> 04:46:25.811
(laughter)

7084
04:46:25.811 --> 04:46:27.052
MATT: Jeez.

7085
04:46:29.550 --> 04:46:31.492
The morning comes.

7086
04:46:33.594 --> 04:46:36.994
As you all slowly come to consciousness,

7087
04:46:38.240 --> 04:46:41.199
a voice rings out amongst the sanctum.

7088
04:46:42.855 --> 04:46:43.938
"It's done!

7089
04:46:45.946 --> 04:46:50.029
"By the might of the Allhammer, it's fucking done!"

7090
04:46:51.783 --> 04:46:55.348
You all come to consciousness abruptly,

7091
04:46:55.348 --> 04:46:56.598
except for you.

7092
04:46:58.725 --> 04:47:00.058
SAM: Oh god.
LAURA: What?

7093
04:47:01.504 --> 04:47:05.070
MATT: You all come out into the sanctum.

7094
04:47:05.070 --> 04:47:09.270
You can see Khemdal is asleep in a chair.

7095
04:47:10.471 --> 04:47:14.723
You can see that Deilin is asleep off to the side,

7096
04:47:14.723 --> 04:47:17.305
curled in the corner, and there is a sleepless,

7097
04:47:17.305 --> 04:47:20.829
kind of manic-looking Umagorn

7098
04:47:20.829 --> 04:47:24.481
holding a single blade.

7099
04:47:24.481 --> 04:47:25.555
SAM: Whoa.

7100
04:47:25.555 --> 04:47:29.508
MATT: You see the thick longsword,

7101
04:47:29.508 --> 04:47:33.379
almost broadsword type of blade length

7102
04:47:33.379 --> 04:47:35.423
with runes in a groove down the center,

7103
04:47:35.423 --> 04:47:38.596
the metal silver with a slight blue shimmer to it,

7104
04:47:38.596 --> 04:47:42.435
akin to the coloration of iceflex.

7105
04:47:42.435 --> 04:47:44.202
LAURA: Wow.

7106
04:47:44.202 --> 04:47:47.839
MATT: Where the break once was, the lines are still there.

7107
04:47:47.839 --> 04:47:50.029
The lines have been continued to almost have

7108
04:47:50.029 --> 04:47:51.949
this marbled look to it.

7109
04:47:51.949 --> 04:47:53.222
SAM: Nice.

7110
04:47:54.656 --> 04:47:56.172
MATT: He goes, "Ah,

7111
04:47:57.872 --> 04:48:02.333
"This, Tyla, Tyla!

7112
04:48:02.333 --> 04:48:03.318
Tyla!"

7113
04:48:03.318 --> 04:48:05.375
He starts yelling out, he's looking like,

7114
04:48:05.375 --> 04:48:09.506
eyes huge bags under there, and he's just like sweating.

7115
04:48:09.506 --> 04:48:11.648
Eventually Tyla comes out and goes like,

7116
04:48:11.648 --> 04:48:13.683
"Right, can I help you?

7117
04:48:13.683 --> 04:48:14.850
"Oh, it's done?

7118
04:48:15.723 --> 04:48:17.533
"I should start carving."

7119
04:48:17.533 --> 04:48:18.965
She goes and runs off and grabs her tools

7120
04:48:18.965 --> 04:48:21.769
and finds a place amongst the iron strips along the walls

7121
04:48:21.769 --> 04:48:26.510
and begins chiseling in the scribed memory,

7122
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:29.912
historical record of this artifact's creation,

7123
04:48:29.912 --> 04:48:33.676
or recreation, amongst the other many names and stories

7124
04:48:33.676 --> 04:48:37.479
of what has been built here within the sanctum

7125
04:48:37.479 --> 04:48:39.242
since its inception.

7126
04:48:40.450 --> 04:48:43.428
As you all stumble out in your various states,

7127
04:48:43.428 --> 04:48:44.718
no Fjord.

7128
04:48:44.718 --> 04:48:46.051
LAURA: Where's Fjord?

7129
04:48:48.169 --> 04:48:49.836
MARISHA: Probably just sleeping in.
SAM: Yeah.

7130
04:48:49.836 --> 04:48:51.290
TALIESIN: I'll look around.
LAURA: Go look for him?

7131
04:48:51.290 --> 04:48:52.281
MARISHA: Check on him.

7132
04:48:52.281 --> 04:48:54.539
MATT: Take a little while, there's no sign of him

7133
04:48:54.539 --> 04:48:55.730
on the inside of the sanctum.

7134
04:48:55.730 --> 04:48:58.062
TALIESIN: I'm going to go check outside.

7135
04:48:58.062 --> 04:49:00.320
MATT: You go outside, fresh snowfall through the night.

7136
04:49:00.320 --> 04:49:05.041
You see snow, soft powder, and there's a bit of a dome

7137
04:49:05.041 --> 04:49:09.087
where you guys had had your previous conversation.

7138
04:49:09.087 --> 04:49:10.545
TALIESIN: I brush it off.

7139
04:49:10.545 --> 04:49:14.019
MATT: You brush off the snow, and there's like,

7140
04:49:14.019 --> 04:49:19.003
a hard textured dark coloration.

7141
04:49:19.003 --> 04:49:21.200
It's frozen seaweed.

7142
04:49:22.332 --> 04:49:24.765
TALIESIN: Huh.
LAURA: What the shit!

7143
04:49:28.416 --> 04:49:30.223
TALIESIN: Interesting.

7144
04:49:30.223 --> 04:49:31.556
LAURA: What is that?!

7145
04:49:36.029 --> 04:49:37.831
Caduceus?

7146
04:49:37.831 --> 04:49:39.323
TALIESIN: This is unusual.

7147
04:49:40.883 --> 04:49:42.198
LAURA: Can I go up and look at it?

7148
04:49:42.198 --> 04:49:43.477
MATT: Yeah.

7149
04:49:43.477 --> 04:49:44.993
It's like someone had layered seaweed

7150
04:49:44.993 --> 04:49:47.240
after seaweed after seaweed, and it's tangled

7151
04:49:47.240 --> 04:49:50.033
and messed like a net, and it is frozen solid.

7152
04:49:50.033 --> 04:49:53.096
LAURA: What is this doing out here?

7153
04:49:53.096 --> 04:49:55.634
TALIESIN: Going to take one of the purple crystals,

7154
04:49:55.634 --> 04:49:59.601
and try and push it into the frozen seaweed.

7155
04:50:00.782 --> 04:50:02.503
MATT: It pushes in. It's like ice.

7156
04:50:02.503 --> 04:50:04.134
TALIESIN: It's not cutting through?

7157
04:50:04.134 --> 04:50:04.997
MATT: No.

7158
04:50:04.997 --> 04:50:07.377
LAURA: Should we-- what is it?

7159
04:50:07.377 --> 04:50:09.245
What's in here?

7160
04:50:09.245 --> 04:50:10.745
Is Fjord in here?!

7161
04:50:11.666 --> 04:50:13.655
TALIESIN: I mean--

7162
04:50:13.655 --> 04:50:17.822
MARISHA: Is it vaguely Fjord-shaped?

7163
04:50:17.822 --> 04:50:19.957
Is it like a Pompeii body?

7164
04:50:19.957 --> 04:50:24.146
MATT: No, it's like a dome, about six and a half,

7165
04:50:24.146 --> 04:50:29.146
seven feet wide, and it's like a weird button shape.

7166
04:50:29.753 --> 04:50:31.241
LIAM: Is Wilford Brimley in there?

7167
04:50:31.241 --> 04:50:33.447
MATT: Probably.
LAURA: Hello?

7168
04:50:33.447 --> 04:50:35.578
Are you in here?

7169
04:50:35.578 --> 04:50:36.744
Can you hear us?

7170
04:50:36.744 --> 04:50:38.585
TALIESIN: Start pulling it aside,

7171
04:50:38.585 --> 04:50:40.018
maybe if we bring the sword--

7172
04:50:40.018 --> 04:50:41.001
LIAM: Can you break a piece off?

7173
04:50:41.001 --> 04:50:42.935
MATT: You begin to pull and tear, and parts do break off,

7174
04:50:42.935 --> 04:50:45.291
and the more you break off, the softer it gets

7175
04:50:45.291 --> 04:50:47.228
the further in, until eventually,

7176
04:50:47.228 --> 04:50:50.962
it's like a soft liquid-- or not liquid layer,

7177
04:50:50.962 --> 04:50:55.954
but like an actual kelp-type texture.

7178
04:50:57.122 --> 04:51:00.597
Eventually you pull through, and you find flesh.

7179
04:51:02.198 --> 04:51:04.813
LIAM: Living?
MATT: Half-orc, living flesh.

7180
04:51:04.813 --> 04:51:06.449
SAM: Is it naked?

7181
04:51:06.449 --> 04:51:07.284
MATT: No, it is not.

7182
04:51:07.284 --> 04:51:08.593
(laughter)

7183
04:51:08.593 --> 04:51:10.602
TALIESIN: Is he breathing?

7184
04:51:10.602 --> 04:51:13.566
MATT: You pull apart--
LAURA: Does he feel warm?

7185
04:51:13.566 --> 04:51:14.664
MATT: It is warm.

7186
04:51:14.664 --> 04:51:16.061
LIAM: Let's get him out of here.
LAURA: Fjord?

7187
04:51:16.061 --> 04:51:17.570
LIAM: Pull him out, pull him out.

7188
04:51:17.570 --> 04:51:18.976
SAM: We should take his clothes off.

7189
04:51:18.976 --> 04:51:20.273
LAURA: Why should we take his clothes off?

7190
04:51:20.273 --> 04:51:21.982
SAM: They're covered in kelp.

7191
04:51:21.982 --> 04:51:23.791
LAURA: I mean, we probably should just take the clothes off.

7192
04:51:23.791 --> 04:51:25.013
SAM: I think we should.

7193
04:51:25.013 --> 04:51:27.266
MATT: All right, you take off Fjord's clothes.
LAURA: No.

7194
04:51:27.266 --> 04:51:28.986
(laughter)

7195
04:51:28.986 --> 04:51:29.819
MATT: No.

7196
04:51:29.819 --> 04:51:34.236
But you pull the rest of the seaweed off of his body,

7197
04:51:35.096 --> 04:51:38.501
and he's breathing, and you slowly start

7198
04:51:38.501 --> 04:51:40.976
coming to consciousness.

7199
04:51:42.388 --> 04:51:44.055
You're weirdly sore,

7200
04:51:48.346 --> 04:51:50.738
but sturdier.

7201
04:51:51.602 --> 04:51:53.435
It's hard to describe.

7202
04:51:54.818 --> 04:51:56.813
You see Fjord come awake

7203
04:51:56.813 --> 04:52:00.313
and sit up out of the mass of tendrils.

7204
04:52:03.954 --> 04:52:05.320
TRAVIS: Hi.

7205
04:52:05.320 --> 04:52:06.974
LAURA: Are you cold?

7206
04:52:06.974 --> 04:52:09.281
Do you want to get inside?

7207
04:52:09.281 --> 04:52:10.989
SAM: Are you okay?

7208
04:52:10.989 --> 04:52:11.822
TRAVIS: Yes.

7209
04:52:11.822 --> 04:52:13.231
LAURA: What were you doing in a--

7210
04:52:13.231 --> 04:52:14.380
LIAM: Why are you out here?

7211
04:52:14.380 --> 04:52:15.515
SAM: What happened?

7212
04:52:15.515 --> 04:52:17.015
Do you like bread?

7213
04:52:17.935 --> 04:52:19.018
TRAVIS: In general?

7214
04:52:19.967 --> 04:52:20.967
SAM: Nevermind.

7215
04:52:22.035 --> 04:52:23.794
MARISHA: Your accent's back.

7216
04:52:23.794 --> 04:52:26.111
TRAVIS: No, it's a force of habit, I'm sorry.

7217
04:52:26.111 --> 04:52:26.944
MARISHA: Oh.

7218
04:52:27.933 --> 04:52:31.045
Freaked me out for a second.

7219
04:52:31.045 --> 04:52:33.611
LIAM: What's the last thing you remember?

7220
04:52:34.970 --> 04:52:37.707
TRAVIS: Well, I came outside to meditate,

7221
04:52:37.707 --> 04:52:41.082
in the way that Caduceus showed me.

7222
04:52:43.235 --> 04:52:45.849
LAURA: Does he look different?

7223
04:52:45.849 --> 04:52:47.592
MATT: He looks a little stockier.

7224
04:52:47.592 --> 04:52:50.148
MARISHA: (gasps)
SAM: How about his teeth?

7225
04:52:50.148 --> 04:52:52.119
MARISHA: Did he Spider-Man this shit?

7226
04:52:52.119 --> 04:52:54.464
LAURA: Oh my god, did you Captain America Fjord?

7227
04:52:54.464 --> 04:52:55.499
MARISHA: Oh my god!

7228
04:52:55.499 --> 04:52:57.155
SAM: What superhero did he do?

7229
04:52:57.155 --> 04:52:58.228
MARISHA: What did you do?

7230
04:52:58.228 --> 04:53:00.576
SAM: Did you Wolverine this?

7231
04:53:00.576 --> 04:53:04.217
MATT: He's not an overt, but like, he looks a little--

7232
04:53:05.372 --> 04:53:06.979
where once there was a scrawny Fjord

7233
04:53:06.979 --> 04:53:09.062
is slightly less scrawny.

7234
04:53:10.897 --> 04:53:12.438
MARISHA: Do you gain muscle that quickly

7235
04:53:12.438 --> 04:53:14.322
from our two workouts?

7236
04:53:14.322 --> 04:53:15.632
TALIESIN: Kelp diet.
MARISHA: Yeah.

7237
04:53:15.632 --> 04:53:20.031
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sore, actually, all over.

7238
04:53:20.031 --> 04:53:21.143
TALIESIN: Well--

7239
04:53:21.143 --> 04:53:22.627
MARISHA: I punch him in the arm.

7240
04:53:22.627 --> 04:53:23.544
MATT: It hurts.

7241
04:53:24.436 --> 04:53:25.993
TRAVIS: Ow.
MARISHA: Hurts me or him?

7242
04:53:25.993 --> 04:53:27.192
MATT: Him.

7243
04:53:27.192 --> 04:53:29.567
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.
TRAVIS: Fuck!

7244
04:53:29.567 --> 04:53:30.511
MARISHA: I don't know.

7245
04:53:30.511 --> 04:53:32.361
Did I notice anything?

7246
04:53:32.361 --> 04:53:34.843
MATT: A little more resistance than you're used to.

7247
04:53:34.843 --> 04:53:35.892
TRAVIS: Lactic acid.

7248
04:53:35.892 --> 04:53:37.330
LIAM: Can't you read his shit?

7249
04:53:37.330 --> 04:53:38.611
MARISHA: I <i>can</i> read his shit.

7250
04:53:38.611 --> 04:53:40.415
Well, I have to Flurry of Blows him.

7251
04:53:40.415 --> 04:53:43.325
TALIESIN: We have a gift for you inside.

7252
04:53:43.325 --> 04:53:45.015
LAURA: Come inside.
SAM: Maybe.

7253
04:53:45.015 --> 04:53:46.615
LAURA: Have a nice cup of tea.

7254
04:53:47.846 --> 04:53:48.929
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

7255
04:53:50.140 --> 04:53:52.599
God, it's fucking cold out here.

7256
04:53:52.599 --> 04:53:54.324
LIAM: Yes, we've been telling you to come

7257
04:53:54.324 --> 04:53:56.091
inside, Fjord. Come inside.

7258
04:53:56.091 --> 04:53:57.846
TRAVIS: I've been out here all night?

7259
04:53:57.846 --> 04:54:01.026
SAM: Did you do this to yourself?

7260
04:54:01.026 --> 04:54:02.940
TRAVIS: Kind of look around and take stock.

7261
04:54:02.940 --> 04:54:05.977
MATT: You see the nest-like circular layer

7262
04:54:05.977 --> 04:54:08.243
of seaweed around you.

7263
04:54:09.353 --> 04:54:12.718
TRAVIS: Are you asking me if I built a nest of--

7264
04:54:12.718 --> 04:54:13.551
SAM: Yes.

7265
04:54:14.799 --> 04:54:16.537
TRAVIS: No?

7266
04:54:16.537 --> 04:54:20.117
TALIESIN: That seems to be the obvious answer.

7267
04:54:20.117 --> 04:54:22.408
TRAVIS: I had a dr--.
LAURA: Uh?

7268
04:54:23.964 --> 04:54:27.938
TRAVIS: I did have a dream that I was back out

7269
04:54:27.938 --> 04:54:30.587
amongst the ocean and that there was...

7270
04:54:32.229 --> 04:54:33.354
seaweed.

7271
04:54:34.432 --> 04:54:35.965
MARISHA: Is he back?

7272
04:54:39.457 --> 04:54:41.371
TRAVIS: I don't know.

7273
04:54:41.371 --> 04:54:45.351
There was a voice. It was a new voice.

7274
04:54:45.351 --> 04:54:48.668
Similar to the one that I heard.

7275
04:54:48.668 --> 04:54:49.501
TALIESIN: Hmm.

7276
04:54:50.424 --> 04:54:52.234
TRAVIS: It said I would never be rid of the darkness

7277
04:54:52.234 --> 04:54:54.717
that had been left inside,

7278
04:54:55.900 --> 04:54:58.218
but this new voice

7279
04:54:58.218 --> 04:55:00.768
sounded warm, inviting.

7280
04:55:02.573 --> 04:55:06.490
<i>She</i> sounded like she

7281
04:55:07.973 --> 04:55:09.636
wanted to help,

7282
04:55:09.636 --> 04:55:11.969
if I would help in her name.

7283
04:55:13.524 --> 04:55:16.182
And I said yes, but that was...

7284
04:55:18.574 --> 04:55:20.348
MARISHA: Do something.

7285
04:55:20.348 --> 04:55:21.181
TRAVIS: Do what?

7286
04:55:21.181 --> 04:55:22.497
MARISHA: I don't know, just think about something

7287
04:55:22.497 --> 04:55:23.588
and do something.

7288
04:55:23.588 --> 04:55:26.631
SAM: Make your falchion appear or something.

7289
04:55:26.631 --> 04:55:30.660
TRAVIS: I don't have my-- I'll try to summon the falchion.

7290
04:55:30.660 --> 04:55:31.916
MATT: Nothing.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

7291
04:55:31.916 --> 04:55:33.898
MARISHA: Make water shoot from your hands.

7292
04:55:33.898 --> 04:55:34.964
TRAVIS: Okay.

7293
04:55:36.175 --> 04:55:37.351
MATT: What are you trying to do?

7294
04:55:37.351 --> 04:55:39.211
SAM: Make water shoot from his hands.

7295
04:55:39.211 --> 04:55:41.030
MATT: Water does not shoot from your hands.

7296
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.889
TRAVIS: Sorry.

7297
04:55:41.889 --> 04:55:44.263
MATT: (laughs)

7298
04:55:44.263 --> 04:55:47.389
LIAM: No demon monkey, no nothing?

7299
04:55:47.389 --> 04:55:49.682
LAURA: Try to disguise your face like you used to.

7300
04:55:49.682 --> 04:55:51.099
TRAVIS: Like what?

7301
04:55:52.220 --> 04:55:55.711
LIAM: Make yourself look like Nott.

7302
04:55:55.711 --> 04:55:57.945
TRAVIS: I'm a big Nott!

7303
04:55:57.945 --> 04:55:59.805
MATT: You watch as his entire body shimmers

7304
04:55:59.805 --> 04:56:02.538
into a larger, thicker version of Nott the Brave.

7305
04:56:02.538 --> 04:56:04.421
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: Aah!

7306
04:56:04.421 --> 04:56:06.071
TRAVIS: (shouting)

7307
04:56:06.071 --> 04:56:08.760
(laughter)

7308
04:56:08.760 --> 04:56:09.993
TRAVIS: Drop it.

7309
04:56:11.103 --> 04:56:12.213
(whoosh) Big Nott.

7310
04:56:12.213 --> 04:56:14.441
(shouting)

7311
04:56:14.441 --> 04:56:16.163
(clapping)

7312
04:56:16.163 --> 04:56:17.810
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good, that's good!

7313
04:56:17.810 --> 04:56:19.354
LAURA: You got some powers back.

7314
04:56:19.354 --> 04:56:20.378
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay.

7315
04:56:20.378 --> 04:56:23.878
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, what else, okay, okay.

7316
04:56:25.223 --> 04:56:27.085
SAM: Wait, Eldritch Blast?

7317
04:56:27.085 --> 04:56:28.345
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: No.

7318
04:56:28.345 --> 04:56:29.767
LAURA: Try it, try it, try it!

7319
04:56:29.767 --> 04:56:30.950
TALIESIN: I don't think so.

7320
04:56:30.950 --> 04:56:34.144
TRAVIS: I look out over the cliff side,

7321
04:56:34.144 --> 04:56:39.143
and I will look at Nott and say,

7322
04:56:39.143 --> 04:56:40.902
(Texan accent) Eldritch Blast.

7323
04:56:40.902 --> 04:56:42.259
SAM: Ooh, yee-haw!

7324
04:56:42.259 --> 04:56:43.915
(laughter)

7325
04:56:43.915 --> 04:56:45.737
MATT: Energy gathers within his palm,

7326
04:56:45.737 --> 04:56:48.579
but as opposed to the dull sickly green coloration,

7327
04:56:48.579 --> 04:56:52.033
this has a deeper verdant tint to it as it fires out,

7328
04:56:52.033 --> 04:56:54.423
(imitating impacts) two blasts.
TRAVIS: Oh!

7329
04:56:54.423 --> 04:56:56.757
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow.

7330
04:56:56.757 --> 04:56:58.181
TRAVIS: (panting)

7331
04:56:58.181 --> 04:56:59.264
TALIESIN: That's interesting.

7332
04:56:59.264 --> 04:57:01.185
LIAM: Stella got her groove back.

7333
04:57:01.185 --> 04:57:02.891
LAURA: I'm really proud of you, Fjord.

7334
04:57:02.891 --> 04:57:04.803
TRAVIS: Fucking seaweed wraps are the shit!

7335
04:57:04.803 --> 04:57:07.506
(laughter)

7336
04:57:07.506 --> 04:57:10.609
MATT: Umagorn stumbles out into the snow, is like,

7337
04:57:10.609 --> 04:57:11.809
"I thought everyone would be more excited.

7338
04:57:11.809 --> 04:57:13.225
"I spent all night working on this."

7339
04:57:13.225 --> 04:57:14.795
ALL: (clamoring)

7340
04:57:14.795 --> 04:57:16.345
TRAVIS: We should go inside.

7341
04:57:16.345 --> 04:57:18.751
What the fuck, who took my shirt off?

7342
04:57:18.751 --> 04:57:20.185
SAM: Oh, I mean--

7343
04:57:20.185 --> 04:57:21.321
LAURA: Here, have it back.

7344
04:57:21.321 --> 04:57:22.403
TRAVIS: Let's go inside.

7345
04:57:22.403 --> 04:57:24.186
LAURA: You were wet, and it's--

7346
04:57:24.186 --> 04:57:28.127
(laughter)

7347
04:57:33.076 --> 04:57:35.745
SAM: Didn't know if we needed to resuscitate you

7348
04:57:35.745 --> 04:57:37.127
and rub your chest.

7349
04:57:37.127 --> 04:57:39.461
TRAVIS: I feel well looked after.

7350
04:57:39.461 --> 04:57:41.559
Should we head inside?

7351
04:57:41.559 --> 04:57:43.136
LIAM: The sword's finished.

7352
04:57:43.136 --> 04:57:45.220
MATT: Yeah, Umagorn's like, "Aye, it is,"

7353
04:57:45.220 --> 04:57:46.631
and he holds it up, and you can see

7354
04:57:46.631 --> 04:57:48.449
the blade is beautiful.

7355
04:57:48.449 --> 04:57:49.282
TALIESIN: Well.

7356
04:57:49.282 --> 04:57:51.502
SAM: Fjord, do you want to hold it?

7357
04:57:51.502 --> 04:57:53.932
TRAVIS: (laughs, stammers)

7358
04:57:53.932 --> 04:57:55.842
Caduceus, it's your sword.

7359
04:57:55.842 --> 04:57:58.009
TALIESIN: No, it's definitely not.

7360
04:57:59.162 --> 04:58:01.102
LIAM: Who else here is going to use a sword?

7361
04:58:01.102 --> 04:58:02.748
LAURA: You do need a new sword.

7362
04:58:02.748 --> 04:58:04.831
TALIESIN: It was waiting for you.

7363
04:58:07.586 --> 04:58:11.061
LAURA: It almost looks like water.

7364
04:58:12.824 --> 04:58:14.874
TRAVIS: Would you mind?

7365
04:58:16.052 --> 04:58:18.011
TALIESIN: This is what we're here for.

7366
04:58:18.011 --> 04:58:20.714
LIAM: There are no accidents, correct, Caduceus?

7367
04:58:20.714 --> 04:58:25.080
TALIESIN: Never, just delightful mistakes.

7368
04:58:27.267 --> 04:58:29.684
I'm going to hand you the sword.

7369
04:58:32.116 --> 04:58:34.471
Embrace your destiny.
MARISHA: Ooh.

7370
04:58:34.471 --> 04:58:36.306
SAM: That's a big piece of paper.

7371
04:58:36.306 --> 04:58:37.880
TALIESIN: Wow!
MARISHA: That's a lot of text.

7372
04:58:37.880 --> 04:58:39.455
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

7373
04:58:39.455 --> 04:58:42.497
ALL: (shouting)

7374
04:58:42.497 --> 04:58:44.351
MATT: I know it went a little long,

7375
04:58:44.351 --> 04:58:45.617
but I feel like it was worth it.

7376
04:58:45.617 --> 04:58:46.482
TALIESIN: Worth it!

7377
04:58:46.482 --> 04:58:48.670
(laughter)

7378
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:49.956
MATT: We'll pick up from there in two weeks.

7379
04:58:49.956 --> 04:58:51.748
LIAM: Awesome.
MATT: Because we got a week off.

7380
04:58:51.748 --> 04:58:52.754
MARISHA: Reani!

7381
04:58:52.754 --> 04:58:53.689
MATT: Reani.

7382
04:58:53.689 --> 04:58:55.105
LAURA: You were so wonderful!

7383
04:58:55.105 --> 04:58:57.363
MARISHA: Don't cry; it's not over!

7384
04:58:57.363 --> 04:58:58.425
It's not the end.

7385
04:58:58.425 --> 04:59:00.113
SAM: It's over forever.

7386
04:59:00.113 --> 04:59:02.560
MATT: You're a terrible person.

7387
04:59:02.560 --> 04:59:04.067
LAURA: And you got laid.

7388
04:59:04.067 --> 04:59:05.102
MICA: I know!

7389
04:59:05.102 --> 04:59:06.361
(laughter)

7390
04:59:06.361 --> 04:59:07.706
MATT: Wait, is that canon?

7391
04:59:07.706 --> 04:59:09.017
MARISHA: I got a rose.

7392
04:59:09.017 --> 04:59:11.473
SAM: They spent some time together.
Who knows, who knows.

7393
04:59:11.473 --> 04:59:12.804
TRAVIS: Pure speculation.

7394
04:59:12.804 --> 04:59:14.675
MATT: There you go.
SAM: Speculations.

7395
04:59:14.675 --> 04:59:16.157
TALIESIN: Sex on graph paper.

7396
04:59:16.157 --> 04:59:17.529
MATT: Thank you for joining us.

7397
04:59:17.529 --> 04:59:20.221
LAURA: It was so much fun.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

7398
04:59:20.221 --> 04:59:22.492
MICA: I'm sorry, I'm an emotional bitch.

7399
04:59:22.492 --> 04:59:24.624
(laughter)

7400
04:59:24.624 --> 04:59:25.670
MATT: Girl--

7401
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:28.178
The internet's watched all of us cry

7402
04:59:28.178 --> 04:59:30.125
many times on the internet.

7403
04:59:30.125 --> 04:59:33.399
This just makes you even more a part of the family, really.

7404
04:59:33.399 --> 04:59:35.668
(laughs)

7405
04:59:35.668 --> 04:59:37.994
MICA: I'm going to cry so much tonight.

7406
04:59:37.994 --> 04:59:39.785
TALIESIN: I get a day of extra life for every tear,

7407
04:59:39.785 --> 04:59:40.618
so I'm good.

7408
04:59:40.618 --> 04:59:42.986
(laughter)

7409
04:59:42.986 --> 04:59:45.196
MICA: See me crying during everybody's speeches.

7410
04:59:45.196 --> 04:59:46.354
You're going to live forever.

7411
04:59:46.354 --> 04:59:48.135
TALIESIN: Oh man.
MATT: We already knew that.

7412
04:59:48.135 --> 04:59:48.983
TALIESIN: Yeah.

7413
04:59:48.983 --> 04:59:49.857
(laughter)

7414
04:59:49.857 --> 04:59:51.590
MATT: Anyway, thank you so much for joining us.

7415
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:52.525
It's been amazing.

7416
04:59:52.525 --> 04:59:54.619
MARISHA: You have to keep hanging out with us.
MICA: Okay.

7417
04:59:54.619 --> 04:59:55.627
(laughter)

7418
04:59:55.627 --> 04:59:58.130
I'll just live under the table. It's fine.

7419
04:59:58.130 --> 05:00:00.449
MATT: Thank you guys for joining us tonight.

7420
05:00:00.449 --> 05:00:04.418
Don't forget, next Thursday is the Vox Machina wedding

7421
05:00:04.418 --> 05:00:07.947
of Percival and Vex'ahlia. Check it out

7422
05:00:07.947 --> 05:00:09.933
in the interim. We'll be back in two weeks.

7423
05:00:09.933 --> 05:00:10.766
We'll see you then.

7424
05:00:10.766 --> 05:00:13.221
Don't forget, we love you very much,

7425
05:00:13.221 --> 05:00:15.428
and is it Thursday yet?

7426
05:00:15.428 --> 05:00:16.486
Good night.

7427
05:00:16.486 --> 05:00:21.411
(dramatic music)

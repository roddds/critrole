MATT: Hello, and welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:09.225
actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.
Before we jump into tonight's game, we have some

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:10.771
quick announcements to get over, but welcome
regardless.

00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:12.315
LAURA: To get over?

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:15.708
MATT: To get over the announcements, you know, to
make it work. First and foremost, we have our

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:19.138
fantastic returning sponsor for tonight, our
friends for this campaign, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:20.404
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.084
MATT: They've been awesome and, Sam, you have a
few things to say?

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:32.704
SAM: I'm ready. In honor of our impending trip to
Chicago, I'm dedicating this ad for D&amp;D Beyond to

00:00:32.704 --> 00:00:40.797
the Second City. One disclaimer: like all accents
I do, my Chicago accent is "harrible."

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:43.824
(laughter)

00:00:43.824 --> 00:00:50.457
SAM: (in Chicago accent) Hey there, Grabowskis.
Everybody from Wrigleyville to Lincoln Park is

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:56.784
talking about the D&amp;D Beyond. Whether you're
checking out the Bean, riding the Red Line, or

00:00:56.784 --> 00:01:04.946
getting a pop at a Blackhawks game, you're always
thinking about the Dungeons and the Dragons, and

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:10.437
right now, if you enable content sharing on the
D&amp;D Beyond and one of your pals has a Master Tier

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:19.050
subscription, your whole campaign crew can share
all the materials and the content, not just the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.747
DM. Anybody with a Master subscription can do it,
so jump on the "L," take the Eisenhower to the

00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:37.159
Kennedy, throw back a PBR or a 312 and grab a deep
dish on me, because life just got a little better

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.131
with the D&amp;D Beyond. Oh, and don't forget to call
dibs on the Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, out next

00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:52.350
month. Pre-order yours on the D&amp;D Beyond site and
get all kinds of exclusive stuff and junk. Go Bears!

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:02.502
MATT: Nailed it. Nailed it in one. Thank you, Sam,
and thank you, awesome folks at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:05.010
LAURA: And sorry, Chicago.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.972
SAM: Sausage!

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:11.783
MATT: There's a lot of options, lot of--

00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:17.341
TALIESIN: Make sure Sam exits the plane first. Sam
exits the plane first.

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:26.764
MATT: All right. Moving on. Reminder, if you have
Amazon Prime, you can go ahead and combine that

00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:30.766
with your Twitch account for Twitch Prime, which
allows you to subscribe, for free, to a Twitch

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:34.212
channel of your choice every month. It doesn't
cost you anything and you get to support your

00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:38.738
favorite channel out there, so check it out if you
haven't yet. Critical Recap of course is now

00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:44.155
available. Our fantastic Dani Carr hosts a recap
of the campaign two so far. It updates every week

00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:47.557
with the episodes. If you haven't seen the one
that was earlier today, actually at the start of

00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:52.473
the art reel, well, you're probably going to be
out of place if you didn't watch last episode, but

00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:55.168
you can check out recaps or send it to your
friends who want to get updated into the campaign

00:02:55.168 --> 00:03:01.881
quickly and watch live with us, if they want to,
to check out Critical Recap. Talks Machina, our

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:07.954
talk after-show about this show is every Tuesday
at 7:00pm Pacific, and the episode about tonight's

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:13.499
episode will be next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific
time. Our fantastic host, Brian W. Foster, and a

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.360
few of us will be there to join and talk about the
events of this evening, so check it out then on

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.254
Twitch and Project Alpha. We are, of course, all
leaving tomorrow to fly to the fantastic city of

00:03:25.254 --> 00:03:30.441
Chicago for C2E2, so looking forward to seeing a
bunch of you Critters out there for that. We’ll

00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:34.894
have panels and signings, it's going to be great.
We're excited, and we’ll see you guys there in a

00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:36.319
couple days.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.889
LAURA: Maybe have chosen too many dice tonight.

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.592
TRAVIS: What were the words you just used?

00:03:41.592 --> 00:03:43.518
LAURA: I just-- okay.

00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:45.604
SAM: There's no such thing!

00:03:45.604 --> 00:03:50.286
TRAVIS: There's hope.

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:59.692
MATT: Vox Machina: Origins, issue six, the last
comic of this six-issue run, finishes soon. The

00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:04.321
date is April 18th. April 18th will be the release
of the final issue of this arc.

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:05.941
SAM: We all die in it.

00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:12.640
MATT: Spoilers. Yeah, it's a bit anachronistic
with the campaign, it's weird. The print edition

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.479
will be available as an anthology of the entire
six-issue run soon. We'll have details on that as

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.846
soon as they’re available, but on April 18th,
check out the final issue of the run. I hope you

00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:28.094
enjoy it. All right, let’s see. Other than that,
we have a fantastic charity, 826LA. Definitely

00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:31.229
check it out if you haven't had a chance. 826 is
all over the country. They do great work for

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:38.020
teaching creative writing for young adults and
children. They do fantastic work. Check it out if

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.189
you haven't. See if you can volunteer, or if not,
help donate. They're amazing. And I believe that's

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:55.200
all for tonight's update, which means that brings
us to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.157
[click, TV static]

00:04:59.157 --> 00:06:16.656
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.878
(laughter)

00:06:20.878 --> 00:06:27.907
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off, the
Mighty Nein had gotten themselves involved in a

00:06:27.907 --> 00:06:34.638
number of various factions in the city of Zadash
and decided to buy in to aid the Knights of

00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:39.352
Requital in their attempt to get one of the
various powerful lords of the city and the

00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:45.015
High-Richter, both seemingly corrupt individuals,
ousted. You had planned forgeries that you were

00:06:45.015 --> 00:06:50.393
going to place in their homes at night during an
offsite gala in the Tri-Spires, not too far from

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:54.868
where your breaking and entering was to occur.
Bringing Ulog along, one of the members of the

00:06:54.868 --> 00:07:00.057
Knights of Requital, you snuck into Lord Sutan's
house, managed to avoid a number of the pitfalls,

00:07:00.057 --> 00:07:04.091
traps, and contents within, going straight to the
bedroom, where you battled the Rug of Smothering,

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:10.208
knocking a couple of you out, but found within a
couple of interesting items that you gathered, and

00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:17.519
the wax seal you needed to complete the forgeries
to make this loop come together. From there, you

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:22.501
immediately went across over to the High-Richter's
home. You managed to-- well, the two of you

00:07:22.501 --> 00:07:25.725
managed to obscure yourselves to look like the
High-Richter and one of her guards, went right

00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:30.536
into the abode. The rest of you met from the
outside, and within the interior of the bedroom,

00:07:30.536 --> 00:07:36.384
you discovered Ulog had found papers that proved
that his wife was innocent and that the

00:07:36.384 --> 00:07:43.551
High-Richter was basically making an example out
of her, as well as discovering a scroll case that

00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:54.064
led to a brief confrontation. After placing the
document required, you went to leave right as the

00:07:54.064 --> 00:08:00.917
High-Richter seemed to have arrived. She had a
seemingly confident demeanor as she rung the bell

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:07.740
for her guards, and at that moment, Ulog,
realizing that this was his chance to get

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.532
vengeance when no one else was taking a stand,
rushed her, placed a bead within her mouth that

00:08:13.532 --> 00:08:17.023
caused a Fireball to detonate, killing them both,
destroying most of the torso of the High-Richter

00:08:17.023 --> 00:08:24.452
and Ulog together. At that point, you all began to
radically find a way to flee; the window shattered

00:08:24.452 --> 00:08:30.021
out from the gable windows at the top floor. You
heard the guards trying to bash in the front door

00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:35.013
to make their way in. After fleeing outside, you
heard this strange sound as this large, dark

00:08:35.013 --> 00:08:42.598
sphere seemed to emerge from the distant Zauber
Spire of the Halls of Erudition. It seemed to

00:08:42.598 --> 00:08:47.695
collapse in itself, causing the base of the tower
to lose structure, and it began to tip over,

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:52.627
stopping midway, seemingly by some sort of force
field holding it in place. You watched as two

00:08:52.627 --> 00:08:56.647
darkened figures leapt from the tower, while two
other ones began to glide off the top of the

00:08:56.647 --> 00:09:01.492
tower, firing bolts of energy in various forms of
magical attack in their direction. Using the

00:09:01.492 --> 00:09:05.967
chaos, you all fled through the night, darkness,
back towards the sewers where you came. You

00:09:05.967 --> 00:09:09.835
managed to watch one of the two dark figures be
slaughtered on the street and be gathered by some

00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:16.797
shaded, older figure who was one of the flying
mages who was giving chase. You all ducked down

00:09:16.797 --> 00:09:24.037
into the sewer system, and began to notice a trail
of blood amongst the dried sewer run. Putting some

00:09:24.037 --> 00:09:28.711
lights up ahead of you at this intersection, which
you had been previously before, you immediately

00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:33.713
noticed there was a darkened figure of black
leather armor with various horns and hooks at the

00:09:33.713 --> 00:09:41.259
joints, chitinous insect-like in its appearance.
The creature seemed to notice your presence and

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:47.110
called out in a language you couldn't understand.
In an attempt to cast a spell to understand the

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:52.362
language, the creature seemed to deem it as an
aggressive stance and then rushed you. And that's

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:55.269
where we left off, so to begin, I'd like you all
to roll initiative.

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:57.032
ALL: No!

00:09:57.032 --> 00:09:58.587
LAURA: That was so fast!

00:09:58.587 --> 00:10:01.697
TRAVIS: I am ready, my body is ready.

00:10:01.697 --> 00:10:03.276
LAURA: Oh no, I chose poorly.

00:10:03.276 --> 00:10:05.262
SAM: Yes, you did. You rushed the process.

00:10:05.262 --> 00:10:06.652
LAURA: I did.

00:10:06.652 --> 00:10:08.641
MATT: All right, so, 25 to 20?

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.901
MARISHA: 21.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:20.369
MATT: 21? All right. Let’s see here. 20 to 15?

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:23.359
LAURA: Oh no.

00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:24.837
MATT: 15 to ten?

00:10:24.837 --> 00:10:25.984
TALIESIN: 14.

00:10:25.984 --> 00:10:27.151
SAM: 11.

00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:28.208
LIAM: 11.

00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:40.603
MATT: All right, so we have Molly, then we have
Caleb and Nott together. All right. Who's next? I

00:10:40.603 --> 00:10:46.153
guess I should say. What'd you roll? All righty.
At the top, we've got Jester.

00:10:46.153 --> 00:10:51.636
TRAVIS: Even in love, we are close. Wait, in game.
In love? Fuck it.

00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:58.726
MATT: All right. So. Top of the combat round, as
it pulls its jagged blade out of its side and

00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:02.737
darts forward in the direction of the group, Beau,
you actually have the first reaction. Seeing this

00:11:02.737 --> 00:11:06.029
happen, you immediately jump into action, and
what's your turn?

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:10.199
MARISHA: Anyone speak Dark-Shady-Guy-in-a-Sewer?

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:13.451
MATT: Don’t have time to react. What are you
doing?

00:11:13.451 --> 00:11:22.933
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to get out the rope and
climbing hook that I had from earlier, and I'm

00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:29.258
going to say, Jester, catch! Oh, wait, you're
super last. Okay, never mind. I'm going to rush to

00:11:29.258 --> 00:11:30.586
him and see if I can--

00:11:30.586 --> 00:11:33.447
MATT: You look over at Jester, who is holding
Caleb up and is not even paying attention. You're

00:11:33.447 --> 00:11:34.845
like, "Shit!"

00:11:34.845 --> 00:11:42.677
MARISHA: I'm going to rush to him and see if I can
grapple? I'm so bad at grappling.

00:11:42.677 --> 00:11:46.529
TRAVIS: Are you? Is it strength-based? Oh.

00:11:46.529 --> 00:11:48.867
MATT: It's athletics-based.

00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:51.261
MARISHA: My athletics is okay.

00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:52.621
TRAVIS: That's not bad.

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:57.699
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to see if I can take the
grappling hook and swing it around and grapple.

00:11:57.699 --> 00:12:02.002
MATT: All righty. So go ahead and make your
athletics check.

00:12:02.002 --> 00:12:06.975
MARISHA: Okay, big money. Okay, that's all right.
16.

00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:19.803
MATT: You actually beat him. Wow. That was a five
plus ten on that one. That was a 15. So you wrap

00:12:19.803 --> 00:12:27.061
the rope around and, immediately, it's grappled in
place, unable to move. Although its arms are free,

00:12:27.061 --> 00:12:31.443
it cannot seem to pull itself away from you. So
that's your action-- that's your attack.

00:12:31.443 --> 00:12:40.442
MARISHA: I'm going to see if I can do a blow to
his temple with my elbow.

00:12:40.442 --> 00:12:42.363
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:46.514
MARISHA: This is just an off-handed attack, right?
16.

00:12:46.514 --> 00:12:52.028
MATT: 16 does not hit. You swing, and the head
ducks out of the way. It swings wide and it glides

00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:54.799
against the edge of the leather mask, but makes no
impact.

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:56.002
TRAVIS: 16 does not hit?

00:12:56.002 --> 00:12:56.834
MATT: Correct.

00:12:56.834 --> 00:12:58.134
TRAVIS: 16 does not hit.

00:12:58.134 --> 00:12:59.423
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Beau.

00:12:59.423 --> 00:13:00.343
TRAVIS: Did you hear that?

00:13:00.343 --> 00:13:01.200
SAM: No, none of it.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.379
TRAVIS: It's very important.

00:13:02.379 --> 00:13:04.053
SAM: Did Beau make out with the Crick?

00:13:04.053 --> 00:13:05.361
TRAVIS: 16 does not hit.

00:13:05.361 --> 00:13:06.874
LAURA: 16 doesn't hit him?

00:13:06.874 --> 00:13:08.751
MARISHA: I've got him wrapped and grappled.

00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:11.122
SAM: Wow, that was fast.

00:13:11.122 --> 00:13:15.092
MATT: The dark figure, arm looking at you, and
looking out in the middle of the space,

00:13:15.092 --> 00:13:20.411
concentrates for a second, puts its hand without
the blade in it-- actually, it would be this one,

00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:24.376
because it's right-handed-- focuses for a second.
As it does, you watch as this tiny bead of

00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:28.665
darkness appears in the center of the area and
expands until a sphere of pitch-black light

00:13:28.665 --> 00:13:36.208
completely engulfs this space, and none of you can
see into it or past it. You are blind within this

00:13:36.208 --> 00:13:40.688
sphere, and you guys see the whole hallway, it
consumes the creature and Beau.

00:13:40.688 --> 00:13:41.834
TRAVIS: Neat trick.

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:42.986
LAURA: Oh no.

00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:46.557
TRAVIS: Yeah, darkvision in that is still blind if
you go in there, right?

00:13:46.557 --> 00:13:47.438
MATT: Yep.

00:13:47.438 --> 00:13:48.716
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

00:13:48.716 --> 00:13:51.016
LAURA: Oh no. We could hit Beau.

00:13:51.016 --> 00:13:52.830
TRAVIS: We're going to.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.364
MATT: That's going to end its turn. That brings us
to Molly.

00:13:57.364 --> 00:14:07.219
TALIESIN: I'm going to head up to the other side
of the void. Yeah, I’m going to sit there. I'm

00:14:07.219 --> 00:14:13.908
going to start one of the blades up, and I'm going
to hold my attack for anything that crosses my path.

00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:16.183
MATT: Okay. So if anything comes within range that
you want to attack--

00:14:16.183 --> 00:14:18.527
TALIESIN: Actually, I'll say the minute I see
something, it's Vicious Mockery.

00:14:18.527 --> 00:14:23.812
MATT: The minute you see something, Vicious
Mockery, got it. Okay, all right, so you draw your

00:14:23.812 --> 00:14:28.400
blade out, you take the damage, and you prepare
Vicious Mockery. Got it. All right. That ends your

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.316
turn, Molly. Caleb and Nott.

00:14:31.316 --> 00:14:32.490
SAM: We're up already?

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.601
MATT: You guys are up on the same turn.

00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:35.907
TRAVIS AND MARISHA: It's literally right here.

00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:41.085
TRAVIS: The Crick is right between these two?
Beauregard and Molly?

00:14:41.085 --> 00:14:42.207
MATT: Yeah.

00:14:42.207 --> 00:14:44.598
LIAM: Yeah, you go first.

00:14:44.598 --> 00:14:46.323
SAM: Me?!

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.799
LAURA: Don’t call it a Crick, it’s insulting, it’s
a derogatory term.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:15:01.181
SAM: The Xhorhasian? Okay. Uh. Shit, I don't know. Why
are we attacking this person?

00:15:01.181 --> 00:15:03.235
LAURA: Because he attacked us first.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.380
TRAVIS: He’s covered in hooked armor and running
at us aggressively.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.239
MARISHA: Let’s subdue him and talk to him!

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:17.676
LIAM: Okay, so I will go-- I will destroy the
initiative ranking! I will send my globules of

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:20.115
light into the darkness to see if it has any
effect.

00:15:20.115 --> 00:15:22.650
MATT: Okay. As the globules go in, they blink
out.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.217
LAURA: Oh no! His spell is higher than your
spell!

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.164
LIAM: And then I'm going to back up--

00:15:28.164 --> 00:15:29.359
MATT: Did you send all of the globules in there?

00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:30.835
LIAM: No, let’s say two of them.

00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:35.039
MATT: Okay. The two blink out. The two remain
there, but the other two you sense that they're no

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:38.595
longer in existence. You have two globes lighting
up the area now. It's low light in here.

00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:46.153
LIAM: At the same time I will back up my full
movement while Frumpkin runs into the edge of that

00:15:46.153 --> 00:15:47.449
darkness.

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:52.858
MATT: All right. Frumpkin peeks in. All right.
Cool. That ends your turn. Nott, what are you doing?

00:15:52.858 --> 00:16:03.041
SAM: I'm looking around. I'm not seeing a lot of
attacking going on. They don't speak our language.

00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:15.326
Shit. Maybe they speak-- No, I don't know. All
right. I will cast Message, and I will point into

00:16:15.326 --> 00:16:28.500
the darkness at the creature. I'll say: Do not
fight us! We are no fans of the empire either! You

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.856
can reply to this message. Do I sense a reply?

00:16:32.856 --> 00:16:40.369
MATT: You do not sense a reply. But for the hell
of it, go ahead and make a persuasion.

00:16:40.369 --> 00:16:42.418
SAM: That's a two minus three.

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:44.340
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.354
SAM: Oh no, just a two minus one, Matt. I'm still
in the black.

00:16:49.354 --> 00:16:53.546
MATT: Perfect. Finishing, Nott, do you want to
move anywhere?

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:58.262
SAM: Yeah, I'll go front and left. Is there
anywhere to hide?

00:16:58.262 --> 00:17:01.557
MATT: Not in this area, no. You'd have to get over
here to hide.

00:17:01.557 --> 00:17:04.403
SAM: Then I will bonus action dash over there.

00:17:04.403 --> 00:17:10.655
MATT: There you go. Good to know. That finishes
Nott and Caleb's turn. Jester, you're up.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.385
LAURA: Me?

00:17:12.385 --> 00:17:13.421
MATT: You.

00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:24.350
LAURA: Oh gosh! Okay. I'm going to prep the spell
Hold Person and I'm going to wait to cast it until

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.749
I can see him.

00:17:25.749 --> 00:17:31.103
MATT: Okay. Good to know. You're prepping the
spell. That ends your turn. Fjord, you're up.

00:17:31.103 --> 00:17:32.788
Unless you want to move at all.

00:17:32.788 --> 00:17:38.505
LAURA: I'm going to move across the sewer across
from Fjord.

00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:43.256
MATT: Okay, good to know. Fjord, you have Armor of
Agathys on. You cast that reactionary last time,

00:17:43.256 --> 00:17:44.844
so what are you doing?

00:17:44.844 --> 00:17:50.287
TRAVIS: Can I look and say: Everyone stay here.
I'm going to see how far this darkness goes. I'm

00:17:50.287 --> 00:17:57.243
going to double dash and run down 60 feet in that
direction, hopefully not running into anybody.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:01.406
I'll stop if I come into the light.

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:05.581
MATT: All right. You stop as soon as you come to
the other side. As you rush past, there's a

00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:07.083
(swoosh) in the darkness.

00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:08.575
LAURA: Oh no, you get cut!

00:18:08.575 --> 00:18:09.767
TRAVIS: That’s okay.

00:18:09.767 --> 00:18:13.204
MATT: That is going to be a 25 to hit.

00:18:13.204 --> 00:18:21.333
TRAVIS: Pray tell, it doth hit. That's okay, I've
got the armor on. I've got that armor, boo.

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.900
MATT: It did roll very high.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.736
TRAVIS: That's all right, he's going to take it.

00:18:25.736 --> 00:18:29.989
MATT: So that is ten points of slashing damage.

00:18:29.989 --> 00:18:31.747
TRAVIS: Oh shit, all ten?

00:18:31.747 --> 00:18:34.099
MATT: But he takes damage back, right?

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.504
TRAVIS: He does take ten ice damage back, yeah.

00:18:36.504 --> 00:18:44.985
MATT: As you run by, the blade strikes. You manage
to feel it glide off your ice armor and you feel

00:18:44.985 --> 00:18:50.691
the blast of ice energy. You, Beau, as you're holding
the rope, feel this spray of dark cold and you

00:18:50.691 --> 00:18:52.386
wince at it in the darkness.

00:18:52.386 --> 00:18:54.128
MARISHA: I hate these rides!

00:18:54.128 --> 00:18:57.087
MATT: But that gets you on the other side.

00:18:57.087 --> 00:19:01.520
TRAVIS: Oh, for a bonus action, can I make a
perception check to see if there's anybody on the

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.343
other side of the tunnel?

00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:04.424
MATT: Sure.

00:19:04.424 --> 00:19:07.696
TRAVIS: 13.

00:19:07.696 --> 00:19:11.921
MATT: Okay. You glance over in the area. In the
darkness, the light's fading at this point, but

00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:14.095
you have darkvision. You don't see any other
figure.

00:19:14.095 --> 00:19:15.849
TRAVIS: Can I about-face and wait on the other
side of this?

00:19:15.849 --> 00:19:22.970
MATT: Sure. Waiting on the opposite side. You got
it. All right. That brings it up to the top. Beau,

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.328
you're up.

00:19:24.328 --> 00:19:35.232
MARISHA: Okay. I still have him restrained. I
can't see or do shit. Still holding onto the rope,

00:19:35.232 --> 00:19:40.639
can I full-on football tackle him and try and push
him out of this dark cloud?

00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:41.764
MATT: Try and shove, you mean?

00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:42.812
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:19:42.812 --> 00:19:46.089
MATT: Well, if you have someone grappled, you can
pull them at half movement.

00:19:46.089 --> 00:19:50.982
MARISHA: Oh, I'll do that, then. I'm going to
start, with the rope wrapped around, start like a

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.700
lifeguard, backing out.

00:19:52.874 --> 00:19:54.757
MATT: This way or this way?

00:19:54.757 --> 00:20:00.746
MARISHA: Yeah, towards Fjord. I felt Fjord go by,
so I want to try and go towards Fjord.

00:20:00.746 --> 00:20:05.224
MATT: Okay, so you manage to push it out of it,
right there, and you're both outside of the darkness.

00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:07.421
MARISHA: Look what I caught!

00:20:07.421 --> 00:20:08.314
TRAVIS: You caught a big one!

00:20:08.314 --> 00:20:09.234
MARISHA: Yeah I did!

00:20:09.234 --> 00:20:10.518
LAURA: Oh wait, he's outside the darkness?

00:20:10.518 --> 00:20:12.158
TALIESIN: But we can't see him.

00:20:12.158 --> 00:20:16.072
LAURA: Oh, but he's across from me, through the
darkness.

00:20:16.072 --> 00:20:17.462
MATT: Yeah, it's through the darkness.

00:20:17.462 --> 00:20:18.812
MARISHA: Help me subdue him.

00:20:18.812 --> 00:20:20.364
TRAVIS: I will when it's my turn.

00:20:20.364 --> 00:20:23.444
MATT: Beau, that's your movement. You still have
an action if you want.

00:20:23.444 --> 00:20:32.908
MARISHA: I'm going to do another crack to the
forehead with my off-handed attack. That's a

00:20:32.908 --> 00:20:41.532
natural one. No! Wait. No, it is. I thought it was
a seven. Thought it might be a seven.

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:49.608
MATT: I'll say as you swing, he manages to loosen
the grip a little bit and the rope comes a little

00:20:49.608 --> 00:20:54.069
bit loose. If it attempts to break your grapple,
it's going to have advantage on it.

00:20:54.069 --> 00:20:55.523
MARISHA: Okay.

00:20:55.523 --> 00:21:06.866
MATT: At the beginning of its turn, it's now
grappled up in front of you. It pulls its blade

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:10.702
with both of its hands and its head turns back
towards you, now that you're the one who's been

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:20.311
pushing it out, and it begins to unleash two heavy
strikes against you. That's another 25 and that's

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.141
going to be an 18.

00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:23.359
MARISHA: Both hit.

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:24.605
MATT: Both hit, okay.

00:21:24.605 --> 00:21:25.737
TRAVIS: Wooshed!

00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:27.584
MARISHA: Ouchies.

00:21:27.584 --> 00:21:39.662
MATT: That's going to be 20 points of slashing
damage from the two strikes. As the first blade

00:21:39.662 --> 00:21:46.242
impacts across the front of Beau's chest, there's
this strange grayish flash of energy that seems to

00:21:46.242 --> 00:21:51.319
scatter from the impact of the blow, and it
congeals off to the side, and you watch as this,

00:21:51.319 --> 00:22:00.006
for lack of a better term, a shadow clone of the
creature appears off to the side, behind Fjord, there.

00:22:00.006 --> 00:22:01.488
LAURA: Oh no!

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:07.718
MATT: It looks semi-corporeal. It's still holding
the blade, it has the same armor, but it's

00:22:07.718 --> 00:22:11.322
somewhat translucent and made of this dark grayish
shadow energy.

00:22:11.322 --> 00:22:13.792
MARISHA: Ow.

00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:28.147
MATT: Also, Beau, you feel the second blow that
hits you, it seems to carve a letter or some kind

00:22:28.197 --> 00:22:33.413
of a symbol on your chest as it pulls back, and as it
does, you feel this burning singe, and you look

00:22:33.413 --> 00:22:38.223
down. There's this glowing brand on your chest.
It's not burned into the skin, it appears to be

00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:42.002
magically placed, but you have a brand on your
chest that you don't recognize.

00:22:42.002 --> 00:22:43.971
LAURA: Oh no, it's like Hex or something.

00:22:43.971 --> 00:22:47.214
MATT: That's going to end its turn. Molly, you're
up.

00:22:47.214 --> 00:22:50.890
TALIESIN: Have I heard any of this happening
or--?

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.120
MATT: Yeah, you've heard them impact. It's just
darkness, but you hear yelling and shouting and

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.404
then talking back and forth and then Beau taking
damage and this strange shifting of energy in the

00:22:59.404 --> 00:23:02.647
distance. What are you doing?

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:09.882
TALIESIN: Oh, for gods' sakes. I am going to run
straight through the--

00:23:09.882 --> 00:23:18.196
MATT: 30. You get to the edge of it. You can
barely peek out. You can continue to move, but

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:20.494
it'll be your action to continue to move.

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:23.550
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to stay at the edge of
this and I'm going to use Vicious Mockery.

00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:25.466
MATT: Okay, good to know.

00:23:25.466 --> 00:23:27.912
TALIESIN: (demonic voice) Stop where you are!

00:23:27.964 --> 00:23:30.697
MATT: That is wisdom, right?

00:23:30.697 --> 00:23:32.011
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:33.377
MATT: That's an 18.

00:23:33.377 --> 00:23:35.543
TRAVIS: Does Molly do birthday parties for kids?

00:23:35.543 --> 00:23:37.483
MATT: I'm pretty sure that passes.

00:23:37.483 --> 00:23:38.553
TALIESIN: That passes, yeah.

00:23:38.553 --> 00:23:41.779
MATT: The Vicious Mockery seems to be unaffected
by your demonic voice. Sorry.

00:23:41.779 --> 00:23:44.508
LAURA: Oh no! We have to talk to him, you
guys. We're not going to beat him.

00:23:44.558 --> 00:23:50.445
MATT: He looks <i>pretty</i> wounded already, like
bleeding out the side. It’s your choice in what

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:55.732
you want to do. But he's really powerful, but
<i>really</i> hurt. That finishes your turn, Molly?

00:23:55.732 --> 00:23:58.045
Caleb, Nott, what’re you doing?

00:23:58.045 --> 00:23:59.563
SAM: Oh, it's us again?

00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:04.764
LIAM: Frumpkin will run forward out of the
darkness.

00:24:04.764 --> 00:24:06.620
MATT: This way?

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:13.266
LIAM: Towards the action. Yeah, and poke his head
out, actually, closer to-- He'll come out between

00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:19.617
Molly's legs. Peek right out there. I'm sitting
down in the muck in the sewer and I'm now watching

00:24:19.617 --> 00:24:24.278
and listening to use Comprehend Languages through
Frumpkin.

00:24:24.278 --> 00:24:26.207
MATT: Okay, sounds good.

00:24:26.207 --> 00:24:27.988
TRAVIS: Non-lethal damage!

00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:29.788
MATT: All right, Jester.

00:24:29.788 --> 00:24:31.041
SAM: Oh wait, it's me.

00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:32.714
MATT: Oh no, it hasn't come yet. You're right

00:24:32.714 --> 00:24:39.986
SAM: Although I don't really know what I'm going
to do. Who do I still see? Just Caleb

00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:41.386
way in the back. Jester--

00:24:41.386 --> 00:24:43.787
MATT: You see Caleb and Jester there and this curl
of darkness--

00:24:43.787 --> 00:24:45.537
SAM: Do I hear anything?

00:24:45.537 --> 00:24:47.784
MATT: Yeah, you hear all the sounds happening and
the shouting and the impact--

00:24:47.835 --> 00:24:49.444
SAM: But I don't know where they're coming from?

00:24:49.444 --> 00:24:51.157
MATT: You hear them around that corner. That's all
you know.

00:24:51.157 --> 00:25:10.225
SAM: I'm going to go around the darkness. Around
it, counter-clockwise, to see if I can see around

00:25:10.225 --> 00:25:11.887
the other side without going into it.

00:25:11.887 --> 00:25:15.912
MATT: That's as far as you can get with your
movement. You could bonus if you want to move

00:25:15.912 --> 00:25:16.911
around.

00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:18.940
SAM: I will bonus dash around, just to look.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:24.254
MATT: From there you can see your friends. You can
see Fjord. You can see the creature. You can see

00:25:24.254 --> 00:25:28.666
the shadow form out of the side. You can see Beau,
with a hint of Molly poking out of the darkness.

00:25:28.666 --> 00:25:30.164
SAM: All right, I'm going to shoot the shadow
form.

00:25:30.164 --> 00:25:31.632
MATT: All right, go for it. Roll for an attack.

00:25:31.632 --> 00:25:33.800
SAM: (yelps) 20.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.023
MATT: A 20 hits. Roll damage.

00:25:37.023 --> 00:25:38.958
SAM: Sneak attack?

00:25:38.958 --> 00:25:43.640
MATT Sure. Technically, yeah, because these are
considered one space, there.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:49.200
SAM: Okay. 16.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:55.377
MATT: Okay, you watch as it dissipates. The impact
hits it, and you see it react slightly, and then

00:25:55.377 --> 00:25:57.573
vanish into vapor.

00:25:57.573 --> 00:25:59.124
SAM: It was all in my imagination!

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:01.510
(laughter)

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:05.036
SAM: That's it. That's all I got.

00:26:05.036 --> 00:26:06.208
MATT: All right, Jester, you're up.

00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:11.515
LAURA: I have a question, because I've never
prepped a spell and then not used it. Does that

00:26:11.515 --> 00:26:13.106
use the spell?

00:26:13.106 --> 00:26:14.181
MATT: It does.

00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:15.505
LAURA: That's balls!

00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:18.982
MATT: You cast the spell and then hold the very
last moment, waiting to release it, and then if it

00:26:18.982 --> 00:26:22.477
doesn't happen, the spell expends. I'm sorry.

00:26:22.477 --> 00:26:28.977
LAURA: That is rough. That was a second level.
Okay, can I go and see what's going on around the

00:26:28.977 --> 00:26:30.547
big black spot?

00:26:30.547 --> 00:26:38.491
MATT: Sure. (counting) 30. You can just manage to
see Nott at the corner of it, and that's about as

00:26:38.491 --> 00:26:41.311
much as you can see. The rest of it’s just
darkness still encompassing the corner.

00:26:41.377 --> 00:26:48.371
LAURA: I guess I'll use my dash to go forward and
see what’s going on.

00:26:48.371 --> 00:26:51.883
MATT: 25 or 30? You could get either of those
spaces there, if you want to.

00:26:51.883 --> 00:26:53.287
LAURA: I'll go right there.

00:26:53.287 --> 00:26:55.694
MATT: Right there, all right. So now you can see
it, but that's your movement and your action.

00:26:55.694 --> 00:26:56.937
LAURA: (screams)

00:26:56.937 --> 00:26:58.755
SAM: (screams) I know, right? This is crazy!

00:26:58.755 --> 00:27:00.208
(laughter)

00:27:00.208 --> 00:27:01.290
MATT: Does that end your turn?

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.214
LAURA: I guess so.

00:27:02.214 --> 00:27:03.389
MATT: All right. Fjord, you're up.

00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:04.257
TRAVIS: Can I--

00:27:04.257 --> 00:27:05.478
LAURA: Oh wait, but I have a bonus action.

00:27:05.478 --> 00:27:06.683
MATT: You do have a bonus, yeah.

00:27:06.683 --> 00:27:16.268
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use-- wait, wait--
Healing Word on Beau.

00:27:16.268 --> 00:27:17.803
MARISHA: Yes, please.

00:27:17.803 --> 00:27:22.279
LAURA: I'm going to cast that. Okay, so that is
1d4.

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:23.880
SAM: What will you sing to her? Oh, wait.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.249
LAURA: Nope. Whoa. (childish voice) Three plus
three is six points.

00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:34.840
MARISHA: That's great, thank you. Much better.
Ouchies.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.989
LIAM: I like that an eight-year-old boy delivered
those points.

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:43.858
MATT: All right, Beau, it's your turn. No, it's
Fjord's turn, sorry.

00:27:43.858 --> 00:27:45.468
MARISHA: No, that's right, Fjord's turn.

00:27:45.468 --> 00:27:55.651
TRAVIS: Can I run up behind the assassin and,
using the blunt end of the falchion, the non-edged

00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:59.387
side, can I try and strike non-lethal damage into
the back of his head?

00:27:59.387 --> 00:28:01.481
MATT: You can. Go for it, roll for an attack.

00:28:01.481 --> 00:28:06.925
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage because he's bound?
Grappled?

00:28:06.925 --> 00:28:11.839
MATT: You are technically on opposite sides, so I
would say flanked. I'd allow it.

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:13.103
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:28:13.103 --> 00:28:14.274
LIAM: Barnacle blow.

00:28:14.274 --> 00:28:17.878
TRAVIS: Barnacle blow. 18 plus--

00:28:17.878 --> 00:28:20.185
LAURA: Did you know barnacles scream when you
scrape them off of things?

00:28:20.185 --> 00:28:21.548
SAM: No. That's not true.

00:28:21.548 --> 00:28:23.135
LAURA: No, they do, they go (screams)--

00:28:23.135 --> 00:28:24.796
MATT: 24. That hits. Roll damage.

00:28:24.796 --> 00:28:27.144
TRAVIS: All right, now, non-lethal--

00:28:27.144 --> 00:28:31.259
MATT: Same damage. If you bring it to zero, they
go unconscious, not bleeding out.

00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:37.627
TRAVIS: That is 12 points of damage.

00:28:37.627 --> 00:28:42.367
MATT: 12 points of damage. Whack! You swing across
and slam it from the back of its armor and

00:28:42.367 --> 00:28:48.455
(grunts) you hear this exhale of pain out of its
throat. As it hits, it spins around and you watch

00:28:48.455 --> 00:28:56.609
as that same energy that came out earlier when it
struck Beau, the blow that you hit it dissipates

00:28:56.609 --> 00:29:00.214
into the same energy and then forms into another
shadow version of it behind you.

00:29:00.214 --> 00:29:03.006
LAURA: Is he still taking damage?

00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:10.548
MATT: He's taken damage. He's getting hurt, he's
hurt pretty bad. Does that finish your turn?

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:11.598
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

00:29:11.598 --> 00:29:13.815
MATT: All right. Top of the round, Beau, you're
up.

00:29:13.888 --> 00:29:15.278
MARISHA: Oh God. Okay--

00:29:15.278 --> 00:29:19.706
TRAVIS: He's not hurt enough, apparently.

00:29:19.706 --> 00:29:22.414
MARISHA: I'm going to first try and tighten my
grip on him.

00:29:22.414 --> 00:29:23.728
MATT: Okay.

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:29.364
MARISHA: And can I try and bulldoze him down to
the ground and pin him to the ground?

00:29:29.364 --> 00:29:34.580
MATT: Unfortunately, you need a feat, the Grappler
feat, to then pin somebody.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.783
MARISHA: Cool. I'm going to also try and do
non-lethal damage and knock him on the head.

00:29:38.783 --> 00:29:40.294
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:47.043
MARISHA: Two attacks. Yeah, first one’s a natural
19. Second one is another natural one.

00:29:47.043 --> 00:29:50.522
MATT: The 19 does hit.

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:53.855
TRAVIS: What about the one?

00:29:53.855 --> 00:30:01.076
MARISHA: Sorry, 1d8 plus four is--

00:30:01.076 --> 00:30:02.699
TRAVIS: 12.

00:30:02.699 --> 00:30:04.318
MARISHA: 12, thank you.

00:30:04.318 --> 00:30:10.600
MATT: 12? Nice. So as you crack across the head,
you watch the helmet slip a little bit. You can

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:15.549
see a little bit of the jaw beneath the mask now
and the skin itself has a dark blue, purple color.

00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:21.254
You see white teeth that have pretty prominent
incisors visible.

00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:24.760
MARISHA: Can I take a free action to be like: We
just want to talk to you, damn it!

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.752
MATT: You're just shouting, yeah.

00:30:26.752 --> 00:30:29.687
TRAVIS: Did you hear that important detail about
the enemy that he just revealed?

00:30:29.687 --> 00:30:37.592
SAM: Uh, nope. We were talking. What was the
detail? I mean (coo) what was the detail?

00:30:37.592 --> 00:30:40.087
TRAVIS: Pretty sizable incisors, sharp fucking
teeth.

00:30:40.087 --> 00:30:41.233
SAM: (cooing)

00:30:41.233 --> 00:30:42.103
LAURA: Whoa.

00:30:42.103 --> 00:30:47.153
(laughter)

00:30:47.153 --> 00:30:48.650
MATT: All right, Beau, is that the end of your
turn?

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.916
LAURA: Sorry, Travis. It's important stuff that
we're talking about.

00:30:50.916 --> 00:30:57.261
MATT: All right, it is now the creature's turn.
The creature is going to swing one strike at Beau

00:30:57.261 --> 00:30:58.171
in front.

00:30:58.171 --> 00:31:01.104
TALIESIN: Blood Maledict. With the added--

00:31:01.104 --> 00:31:03.180
SAM: Yeah, drop that BM on him!

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.519
LIAM: You just did that like the glitter guy.
Blood Maledict.

00:31:08.519 --> 00:31:12.134
MATT: Disadvantage.

00:31:12.134 --> 00:31:13.404
TALIESIN: Disadvantage on that.

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:16.543
MATT: Well, you prevented a natural 20, that's
good. So that's 19.

00:31:16.543 --> 00:31:18.336
MARISHA: Still hits.

00:31:18.336 --> 00:31:20.890
MATT: Still hits. That is--

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.340
LAURA: That was good that she didn't get critted.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.029
MATT: Ten points of slashing damage.

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:26.374
LAURA: Are you still up?

00:31:26.374 --> 00:31:27.800
MARISHA: Nope.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.815
SAM: Oh! Wait, we just healed her.

00:31:29.815 --> 00:31:31.994
LAURA: I did, but not for that much.

00:31:31.994 --> 00:31:38.615
MATT: Beau falls to the ground unconscious. The
rope goes loose. At which point, the creature

00:31:38.615 --> 00:31:44.331
turns around towards you, Fjord. As you focus on
its face you feel this swing from behind as the

00:31:44.331 --> 00:31:45.662
shadow version is going to try--

00:31:45.662 --> 00:31:47.076
TRAVIS: Nonlethal!

00:31:47.076 --> 00:31:48.432
SAM: Not in the face!

00:31:48.432 --> 00:31:49.967
MATT: That's going to be 21.

00:31:49.967 --> 00:31:51.028
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:31:51.028 --> 00:31:54.679
SAM: (high-pitched) Watch out for the teeth
(coo).

00:31:54.679 --> 00:32:01.022
MATT: That is nine points of slashing
damage and it vanishes. The impact, the actual

00:32:01.072 --> 00:32:04.684
blow hits and discards itself into the impact of
the blow.

00:32:04.684 --> 00:32:06.282
MARISHA: I don't think he wants to talk to us.

00:32:06.282 --> 00:32:07.897
LAURA: It discards itself.

00:32:07.897 --> 00:32:19.311
MATT: Let's see here. It's now going to swing
forward and head over to make a strike at you.

00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:23.356
LAURA: Why me?! I didn't do anything to you.

00:32:23.356 --> 00:32:28.986
TRAVIS: Nonlethal. That's only a 14, no, 15.

00:32:28.986 --> 00:32:30.308
MATT: 15 does not hit.

00:32:30.308 --> 00:32:31.824
TALIESIN: He still has disadvantage.

00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:34.191
MATT: Did you amplify it?

00:32:34.191 --> 00:32:35.613
TALIESIN: Yeah, I did.

00:32:35.613 --> 00:32:38.231
MATT: Okay, that brings it to 19.

00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:43.075
LAURA: 19 probably fucking hits. Yes.

00:32:43.075 --> 00:32:45.713
MATT: Okay, that is eight points of slashing
damage.

00:32:45.713 --> 00:32:47.301
LAURA: Hellish Rebuke!

00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:48.984
SAM and TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:32:48.984 --> 00:32:57.286
LAURA: I'm going to say: I'm not your enemy, you
guy with big teeth. But I say it in Infernal,

00:32:57.286 --> 00:32:58.498
because you know.

00:32:58.498 --> 00:32:59.732
TALIESIN: No, that was good.

00:32:59.732 --> 00:33:01.491
MATT: That's a constitution saving throw for that
one, is it?

00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:02.921
LAURA: Sure, I don't know.

00:33:02.921 --> 00:33:05.630
SAM: (singing) I still get hellish.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.392
MATT: That's a 12. What's your DC on that?

00:33:07.392 --> 00:33:10.535
LAURA: Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
this.

00:33:10.535 --> 00:33:11.888
MATT: What's your charisma bonus?

00:33:11.888 --> 00:33:19.587
LAURA: This is where it gets complicated, I've got
a plus one mod to charisma.

00:33:19.587 --> 00:33:24.343
MATT: All right, so your DC with that would be
11. So yeah, it succeeds. It takes half-damage.

00:33:24.416 --> 00:33:25.577
You still do damage.

00:33:25.577 --> 00:33:28.747
LAURA: Oh okay. Great. Which is 2d10, right?

00:33:28.747 --> 00:33:29.851
MATT: 2d10.

00:33:29.851 --> 00:33:35.543
LAURA: That's a lot. (coo) That's a lot. Oh,
eight. So four.

00:33:35.543 --> 00:33:36.917
MATT: Four points, all right.

00:33:36.917 --> 00:33:38.051
SAM: It's dead.

00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:43.618
MATT: You see this blast of ice come out as you're
shouting Infernal at it. It strikes into the armor

00:33:43.618 --> 00:33:49.242
and pierces parts of its shoulder as it (grunts).
It goes limp for a certain point, you see it flex

00:33:49.242 --> 00:33:59.994
angrily. It's looking really rough. As the attack
hits you, another one appears over there.

00:33:59.994 --> 00:34:02.161
LAURA: How many slashing damage did you say you
did to me?

00:34:02.161 --> 00:34:03.004
MATT: Eight.

00:34:03.004 --> 00:34:03.937
LAURA: Eight, got it.

00:34:05.237 --> 00:34:07.103
TRAVIS: That's a dope feature, whatever that is.

00:34:07.103 --> 00:34:12.751
MATT: All righty, that's going to end its turn.
Molly you're up.

00:34:12.751 --> 00:34:16.080
TALIESIN: If I run up behind it, do I then get
advantage because he's flanked?

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.695
MATT: Yep.

00:34:16.695 --> 00:34:17.562
TALIESIN: I'm going to do that.

00:34:17.562 --> 00:34:18.451
LAURA: Nonlethal.

00:34:21.721 --> 00:34:27.501
TALIESIN: It's all nonlethal once you stabilize it
after you put it down to the ground. All right,

00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:29.417
first strike with the--

00:34:29.417 --> 00:34:30.587
MATT: That's actually not true.

00:34:30.587 --> 00:34:38.762
TALIESIN: No, I know. I'm paying attention. First
strike with the scimitar is a natural 20!

00:34:38.762 --> 00:34:39.321
TRAVIS: Hey!

00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:42.793
TALIESIN: Does that do a thing then? For him or is
it just double damage?

00:34:42.793 --> 00:34:44.366
MATT: It's double damage.

00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:45.669
TALIESIN: Okay, nothing weird in that.

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:48.942
MATT: That's both the weapon and the--

00:34:48.942 --> 00:34:50.449
LAURA: You get all your grit points back, aren't
you excited?

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:57.879
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. I miss things. I don't get
special damage to him, do I?

00:34:57.879 --> 00:35:05.232
MATT: As a reaction, he's going to use Transpose
Echo and shift over with that guy.

00:35:05.232 --> 00:35:06.106
SAM: Did he just--

00:35:08.726 --> 00:35:14.788
MATT: You watch as suddenly there's a shimmy of
shadow energy and he switches places with the

00:35:14.788 --> 00:35:19.223
shadow version of himself. You end up striking the
shadow thing, which is dissipated from the impact.

00:35:19.883 --> 00:35:20.841
LAURA: Bitch.

00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:23.105
TRAVIS: That is some white elephant gift shit,
right there.

00:35:23.105 --> 00:35:25.667
TALIESIN: So I don't have enough movement to go
for another.

00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:28.965
MATT: (counting) You do.

00:35:28.965 --> 00:35:32.846
TALIESIN: Run in, and if I can flank him great. If
not I'm still going to take my shot.

00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:33.550
MATT: Yeah, you can flank him actually.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.979
TALIESIN: All right.

00:35:33.979 --> 00:35:38.398
MATT: So you strike the one. Angrily spin around
and then catch it behind, where you see him

00:35:38.398 --> 00:35:41.244
appear. Filling the spot where his shadow clone
was.

00:35:44.714 --> 00:35:45.727
TALIESIN: That's 21 to hit.

00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:46.536
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

00:35:46.536 --> 00:35:54.786
TALIESIN: 22. Oh god. I don't get the d6 on that,
so that's five points of damage.

00:35:55.577 --> 00:35:59.086
MATT: Five points of damage. How do you want to do
this?

00:35:59.086 --> 00:36:04.962
TALIESIN: I'm going to bounce off the wall, after
the other one hit, and spinning around and finally

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:10.799
taking him, and knocking him out with the little
spike on the side of the sword. Right in the helmet.

00:36:12.729 --> 00:36:17.069
MATT: As you spin the sword around, coming down
(crack) you hit across the side of the head and

00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:20.269
the body collapses and falls to the ground
unconscious.

00:36:23.489 --> 00:36:25.017
TALIESIN: Someone go deal with Beau.

00:36:25.017 --> 00:36:26.020
MATT: The darkness vanishes.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.989
LAURA: I run over to Beau and I cast Cure Wounds
on her.

00:36:28.989 --> 00:36:31.991
TRAVIS: I start patting the body down. Molly help
me.

00:36:31.991 --> 00:36:33.498
TALIESIN: I'm pulling the armor off.

00:36:34.238 --> 00:36:35.268
SAM: Caleb we need you.

00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:40.001
LAURA: Should I? No I'll just cast that at
regular. I cast Cure Wounds on you.

00:36:40.001 --> 00:36:42.481
TALIESIN: Did I feel anything when I hit it?

00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:43.393
LAURA: Seven points.

00:36:43.393 --> 00:36:46.120
TALIESIN: Did it set off the blood hunter spider
sense at all?

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:46.902
MATT: No.

00:36:46.902 --> 00:36:48.718
TALIESIN: All right. Just curious.

00:36:48.718 --> 00:36:51.173
MATT: All right, so as you all--

00:36:51.173 --> 00:36:53.005
LAURA: Is he awake still or does he--

00:36:53.005 --> 00:36:53.880
MATT: Unconscious.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.635
LAURA: Let's tie him up! Quick tie him up!

00:36:55.635 --> 00:36:58.414
TRAVIS: I got 50 feet of hempen rope.

00:36:58.414 --> 00:37:00.466
TALIESIN: I got 50 feet of hempen rope.

00:37:00.466 --> 00:37:02.484
LAURA: Let's tie him up real good.

00:37:02.484 --> 00:37:03.531
TALIESIN: With Beau's.

00:37:03.531 --> 00:37:05.254
TRAVIS: Maybe no bows.

00:37:05.254 --> 00:37:07.523
TALIESIN: I was going to say with Beau's rope,
because she's also got the hook.

00:37:07.523 --> 00:37:12.026
MARISHA: (strained) Oh yeah, I've got a-- I can
also tie bows in my, Beau's, rope.

00:37:12.026 --> 00:37:15.698
LAURA: But also bows are really cool. We should
give him some, because he's got all these barbs

00:37:15.698 --> 00:37:17.620
and they'd be really fun to decorate.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.496
MARISHA: Wait, you want to put my bo in bows--

00:37:20.496 --> 00:37:21.083
TALIESIN: There's no bows.

00:37:21.083 --> 00:37:22.433
LAURA: Just tie him up quick!

00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:26.047
LIAM: This language spell runs out in an hour,
let's speed this up.

00:37:26.047 --> 00:37:30.172
MATT: You strip him of everything he has. There's
the armor you pull off, there's the blade and the

00:37:30.172 --> 00:37:36.737
sheath. There's a pair of dark, jagged black boots
that are pretty cool, three daggers that are all

00:37:36.737 --> 00:37:43.925
hidden in pockets in the armor, and a pouch that
is hidden within the plating of the leather armor

00:37:43.925 --> 00:37:46.215
that is filled with quite a few coin if you go and
inspect within.

00:37:46.215 --> 00:37:48.248
LAURA: Is anybody writing all of this stuff down?

00:37:48.248 --> 00:37:49.624
TRAVIS: Yes, yes I am.

00:37:49.624 --> 00:37:51.100
MARISHA: Boots, something.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.497
TRAVIS: Sword, sheath, black boots, yup.

00:37:52.497 --> 00:37:54.263
MARISHA: Three daggers and lots of gold.

00:37:54.263 --> 00:37:57.127
LAURA: Oh, I am the inventory person. Shit.

00:37:57.127 --> 00:38:01.659
MATT: So that gets you 116 platinum pieces.

00:38:01.659 --> 00:38:03.483
SAM: Whoa, platinum?

00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:04.121
MATT: Yes.

00:38:04.121 --> 00:38:08.327
TALIESIN: I'm going to put 116 platinum.

00:38:08.327 --> 00:38:09.406
LAURA: You weren't even writing it down.

00:38:09.406 --> 00:38:10.306
MATT: And 12 gold pieces.

00:38:10.306 --> 00:38:11.155
TRAVIS: Got it.

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:15.343
TALIESIN: 12 gold. 116 platinum!

00:38:15.343 --> 00:38:20.303
MARISHA: Remember when we lost 500 platinum at the
bottom of the Bag of Holding last campaign for

00:38:20.303 --> 00:38:21.903
months? That was funny.

00:38:21.903 --> 00:38:22.832
LIAM: Between the couch cushions?

00:38:22.832 --> 00:38:25.044
MARISHA: Yes. Oh that's where I put that.

00:38:25.044 --> 00:38:27.897
SAM: Each platinum is worth 100 gold, right?

00:38:27.897 --> 00:38:28.481
MATT: Ten gold.

00:38:28.481 --> 00:38:30.493
LIAM: Do they say "In Xhorhas We Trust" on them?

00:38:32.213 --> 00:38:34.400
MATT: No, they are standard imperial platinum.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.879
MARISHA: We universally forgot it, as a team.

00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:40.154
TRAVIS: All right, so we get him nice and tied up,
right?

00:38:41.505 --> 00:38:42.880
TALIESIN: We can't stay here. We've got to move.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.702
SAM: Why do we have to move? We're in the sewers.
Who's going to come down here?

00:38:46.702 --> 00:38:48.208
TALIESIN: Everybody who's looking for him.

00:38:49.218 --> 00:38:50.661
SAM: Oh. That's fair.

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:51.610
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.007
SAM: What if we hide? Could we hide, could we put
up an illusion to hide?

00:38:55.737 --> 00:38:59.968
TALIESIN: We can start heading back in our
direction at the very least. Get further away from--

00:38:59.968 --> 00:39:07.670
MATT: There is also the dodecahedron that is the
slow undulating gray glow that he was holding,

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.631
before dropping it and rushing towards you.

00:39:09.631 --> 00:39:11.489
LIAM: Oh, let me take a look at it.

00:39:11.489 --> 00:39:15.365
SAM: Won't you lose your other spell if you do the
spell?

00:39:15.365 --> 00:39:17.692
LIAM: What? Does anybody have a torch or anything?
No.

00:39:19.492 --> 00:39:20.139
SAM: Okay.

00:39:21.479 --> 00:39:24.656
LAURA: I didn't write down, did you really write
down that stuff?

00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:29.762
TRAVIS: Yeah, sword, sheath, three daggers, pair
of black boots that look cool, 116 platinum and 12 gold.

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.332
SAM: She got sword, so far.

00:39:32.332 --> 00:39:40.508
LIAM: Okay, I need ten minutes. Ten minutes with
this thing. I'm going to, as a ritual spell, cast Identify.

00:39:40.508 --> 00:39:41.734
MATT: To which object?

00:39:41.734 --> 00:39:43.306
LIAM: On the dodecahedron.

00:39:43.306 --> 00:39:49.468
MATT: Okay. You focus on it for a bit. It is
definitely magic.

00:39:51.508 --> 00:39:53.149
LIAM: (whispering) But it's next level shit.

00:39:54.469 --> 00:40:00.942
MATT: The magic contained is outside of the
parameters of the spell. You're not entirely

00:40:00.942 --> 00:40:05.862
certain what it's capable of. There's something
alien about its magic source that your Identify

00:40:05.862 --> 00:40:07.226
spell is unable to pierce.

00:40:07.226 --> 00:40:07.877
LIAM: Oh.

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:16.831
MATT: As you focus more and more on it, your brain
begins to open up into, what feels like, space.

00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:25.253
Endless expanse and it begins to scare you. Just
the endless infinity of nothingness and you pull

00:40:25.253 --> 00:40:32.579
back and (gasp), "Oh that's... interesting." It seems
very powerful, whatever it is. But you don't know

00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:33.519
quite how it works.

00:40:33.519 --> 00:40:35.335
LIAM: Yeah, I throw a dirty rag over it.

00:40:35.979 --> 00:40:44.746
MARISHA: Molly, do you think this is the weapon
from the crime scene, that we saw? That big glowy,

00:40:44.746 --> 00:40:45.261
black--

00:40:45.261 --> 00:40:47.415
TALIESIN: I don't know it seems kind of small,
doesn't it?

00:40:47.415 --> 00:40:51.352
LIAM: It is extremely powerful, whatever it is.

00:40:51.352 --> 00:40:52.550
MARISHA: See? Extremely powerful.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.847
MATT: Do you want to continue and concentrate on
it?

00:40:53.847 --> 00:40:54.833
LIAM: No.

00:40:55.213 --> 00:40:55.811
MATT: Okay.

00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:58.632
LAURA: Can I take his helmet off, and look at his
face?

00:40:58.632 --> 00:41:01.603
MATT: Sure. You took the helmet off when you took
the armor off.

00:41:01.603 --> 00:41:04.756
LAURA: Just kidding. So that's one of the things
we have as well.

00:41:05.706 --> 00:41:12.433
MATT: The helmet is part of the armor. The armor
is very well made. With the armor removed, you can

00:41:12.433 --> 00:41:21.563
see the deep blue, somewhat purple colored skin.
It resembles, actually, you if a bit darker.

00:41:21.563 --> 00:41:27.239
Whitish gray hair that goes just past the
shoulders. It was tied up in a tight bun into the

00:41:27.239 --> 00:41:33.911
helmet and tumbles past once it was pulled off.
Dark elf, definitive drow.

00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:39.217
MARISHA: Does it look like the same color from the
gauntleted hand that we saw in the alley?

00:41:39.217 --> 00:41:42.470
MATT: Correct, what you thought you saw the
fingers dipped in the color was actually just

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.379
gloves that didn't have the fingers covered.

00:41:44.789 --> 00:41:45.383
TRAVIS: Oh wow.

00:41:46.253 --> 00:41:47.472
LAURA: Is it a boy?

00:41:47.472 --> 00:41:48.981
MATT: It is a male, yes.

00:41:50.721 --> 00:41:53.697
LIAM: What do we want our next step to be?

00:41:54.237 --> 00:41:57.331
SAM: We have to ask him some questions. But we
have to leave, right?

00:41:57.881 --> 00:41:59.037
MARISHA: Let's wake him up.

00:41:59.037 --> 00:42:06.095
MATT: The more you think on it, the more you know
there's more to this device. It scares you, but

00:42:06.095 --> 00:42:11.409
there was something you were close to there.
Something you were close to learning. You're not

00:42:11.409 --> 00:42:15.200
sure what lies beyond that threshold. You keep
thinking on it.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.901
MARISHA: Super baity.

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.952
SAM: One more opportunity.

00:42:18.952 --> 00:42:20.542
TRAVIS: (singing) Might as well jump. Jump!

00:42:20.542 --> 00:42:22.498
(laughter)

00:42:22.498 --> 00:42:24.347
MARISHA: (singing) Go ahead and jump.

00:42:24.347 --> 00:42:25.482
MATT: It's up to you.

00:42:26.192 --> 00:42:27.432
LIAM: (sighs)

00:42:27.432 --> 00:42:34.367
MARISHA: By the way, last time Travis did this, I
jumped off of a cliff and splatted as a goldfish.

00:42:34.367 --> 00:42:38.619
LIAM: I was going to say, let's wake up the elf.

00:42:38.619 --> 00:42:40.275
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah that's fair.

00:42:40.275 --> 00:42:43.874
LAURA: I'm going to pull his hair out of his face
so he can see us.

00:42:43.874 --> 00:42:50.033
MATT: Okay, he's still unconscious. There’s blood
curling out the mouth and nose. He is beaten.

00:42:51.733 --> 00:42:54.779
TRAVIS: If we turn him in, it’ll take attention
off of us in case we have trouble getting out of

00:42:54.779 --> 00:42:56.775
the sewer. But maybe we need to know who this is.

00:42:56.775 --> 00:42:59.978
TALIESIN: Who are these people who caught this
person would be another question they might ask.

00:42:59.978 --> 00:43:00.710
We got to be careful.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.976
TRAVIS: True, good point.

00:43:01.976 --> 00:43:05.653
MARISHA: We could be heroes. Turn him in, invaders
in chains.

00:43:05.653 --> 00:43:07.097
TALIESIN: No one is a hero for very long.

00:43:07.097 --> 00:43:12.369
LAURA: What is the name of the romantic lead in
the romance novel?

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:14.654
MARISHA: That is true, these guys were called
Cricks.

00:43:14.654 --> 00:43:15.253
SAM: Oskar?

00:43:15.253 --> 00:43:19.457
LAURA: No, no, not my romance novel. The one about
these guys.

00:43:19.457 --> 00:43:23.133
LIAM: Well I don't remember it, but Caleb does
because he has photographic memory. So Matt has to

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:23.537
tell me--

00:43:23.537 --> 00:43:25.389
(laughter)

00:43:25.389 --> 00:43:33.789
MARISHA: If anything was true in the porn, you can
always trust porn to be honest.

00:43:33.789 --> 00:43:35.484
LIAM: There is always some truth to porn.

00:43:35.484 --> 00:43:36.959
MARISHA: There's always truth to porn.

00:43:36.959 --> 00:43:38.941
TRAVIS: At least one basic truth.

00:43:40.731 --> 00:43:43.838
MARISHA: This guy is from the Dwendalian Empire,
from the Julous Dominion.

00:43:45.248 --> 00:43:45.926
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:43:45.926 --> 00:43:46.861
TRAVIS: Is that right?

00:43:48.481 --> 00:43:55.946
MATT: No. Well, the main character of the book
was. The Julous Dominion was what once ruled the

00:43:55.946 --> 00:43:56.413
Marrow Valley.

00:43:56.413 --> 00:43:59.185
MARISHA: Remember the porn. It was a very awkward
reading.

00:43:59.185 --> 00:44:00.324
LAURA: The Marrow Valley.

00:44:00.754 --> 00:44:02.229
MARISHA: The Marrow Valley. What was--

00:44:02.229 --> 00:44:03.334
TALIESIN: That was a metaphor.

00:44:04.484 --> 00:44:08.131
MATT: So yeah. So the main character was not
Xhorhasian.

00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:09.002
LIAM: Caleb says.

00:44:09.002 --> 00:44:13.645
MATT: They were a general in the army of Julous.
Which was--

00:44:13.645 --> 00:44:15.400
MARISHA: The army of Julous.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:19.071
MATT: Yeah, the Julous Dominion. Which as during
the conflict, before the Dwendalian Empire

00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:19.648
conquered it.

00:44:19.648 --> 00:44:23.663
MARISHA: Oh, conflict between the Julous Dominion
and the Dwendalian Empire. And she was a general

00:44:23.663 --> 00:44:25.256
for the Dwendalian empire.

00:44:25.256 --> 00:44:25.586
MATT: Right.

00:44:25.586 --> 00:44:27.522
LAURA: Can I heal him and wake him up?

00:44:27.522 --> 00:44:29.315
SAM: Yes we need to-- yes.

00:44:29.315 --> 00:44:30.465
LAURA: Are you guys ready?

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:33.859
MARISHA: She was super in love with this general
named Theo.

00:44:33.859 --> 00:44:34.400
LAURA: Theo.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.405
MARISHA: Theo.

00:44:37.735 --> 00:44:41.305
SAM: How far are we from the entrance, where we
came down into the sewer?

00:44:41.305 --> 00:44:47.663
MATT: You're maybe 150 feet from entrance of where
you came down and you're a few hundred feet from

00:44:47.663 --> 00:44:50.598
the way that leads back up into the city, of the
Interstead Sprawl.

00:44:50.598 --> 00:44:55.125
SAM: Should I go back up to the entrance and make
sure we're not being followed or anything?

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.884
TRAVIS: Sure, if you want to. Unless you have any
questions.

00:44:58.614 --> 00:45:01.076
SAM: Questions? I don't know anything about this
shit.

00:45:01.076 --> 00:45:02.465
TRAVIS: Yeah, go keep watch.

00:45:02.465 --> 00:45:07.032
SAM: Okay. I'm going to head back and look at the
entrance.

00:45:07.032 --> 00:45:08.223
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:10.412
SAM: Seven.

00:45:11.472 --> 00:45:11.927
TRAVIS: Plus?

00:45:12.497 --> 00:45:13.046
SAM: No.

00:45:14.706 --> 00:45:20.688
MATT: Plus no. Okay. You look past and you can see
some folks darting back and forth occasionally

00:45:20.688 --> 00:45:25.689
across the end of the alleyway. Otherwise you just
see the dark, shadowed walls and the dark sky

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:29.961
above with the cloud cover. No one seems to be
immediately coming towards it for the time being.

00:45:32.231 --> 00:45:37.114
LIAM: Jester, my idea is, you know, most people
are not like that crownsguard bastard. Most people

00:45:37.114 --> 00:45:42.915
like cats, so maybe if Frumpkin woke him up, you
know, with a couple of licks, he would wake up in

00:45:42.915 --> 00:45:43.235
a better--

00:45:43.235 --> 00:45:45.075
LAURA: Most people like me too, though.

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.553
LIAM: That's also true.

00:45:46.553 --> 00:45:48.403
LAURA: And I'm blue and he's blue.

00:45:51.213 --> 00:45:52.314
LIAM: It's all yours.

00:45:52.314 --> 00:45:57.479
LAURA: I pat him on his little cheek, and I say
wake up: Theo. Wake up.

00:45:57.479 --> 00:46:03.643
MATT: Okay. It takes a few moments, but
eventually, he (mumbling) (grunts).

00:46:04.723 --> 00:46:05.233
LAURA: (whispers) Hi!

00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:10.327
MATT: Spits out a bit of blood on to the front of
his chest and the rope and (grunts)

00:46:10.327 --> 00:46:15.633
LAURA: You're not dead, because we didn't even
want to fight you, but you attacked us.

00:46:15.633 --> 00:46:20.292
MATT: (speaks in Undercommon) And so you've
cast--

00:46:20.292 --> 00:46:22.632
LIAM: Comprehend Languages. I understand
everything.

00:46:23.712 --> 00:46:29.349
MATT: The essence is "Stupid empirical scum.
You'll get nothing."

00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:31.347
LIAM: He thinks we're with the empire.

00:46:31.347 --> 00:46:35.413
LAURA: We are not with the empire. Look at us!

00:46:37.233 --> 00:46:40.657
LIAM: Do we have any of that Crownsguard armor?
Didn't we collect some?

00:46:42.707 --> 00:46:45.833
MATT: Make a, I'll say a persuasion check, because
you haven't technically allied yourself with the

00:46:45.833 --> 00:46:49.823
empire entirely, though you are part of the
empire. You, specifically, are not part of the

00:46:49.823 --> 00:46:51.427
empire. You did not grow up here.

00:46:52.457 --> 00:46:54.067
TALIESIN: Do we need a little greasing?

00:46:58.247 --> 00:47:01.348
LAURA: Where's my persuasion? Where's persuasion?

00:47:01.348 --> 00:47:02.197
TALIESIN: There it is.

00:47:02.197 --> 00:47:02.865
LAURA: Where?

00:47:02.865 --> 00:47:04.150
TALIESIN: You just rolled over it.

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.652
LAURA: Oh. Nine.

00:47:04.652 --> 00:47:06.230
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Nein!

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:11.698
MATT: His eyes narrow towards you and still bears
the incisor fangs. (breathes heavily)

00:47:11.698 --> 00:47:14.048
LAURA: Oh, Theo, what big teeth you have!

00:47:14.048 --> 00:47:17.482
LIAM: Jester, give me one of the Crownsguard
helmets from your backpack.

00:47:17.482 --> 00:47:18.866
LAURA: I pull it out.

00:47:18.866 --> 00:47:25.991
LIAM: I take this helmet. I set it on the ground
in front of the elf, and then I start to piss on it.

00:47:27.191 --> 00:47:28.321
SAM: The language of love.

00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:30.994
TRAVIS: Just wang out.

00:47:30.994 --> 00:47:34.928
MATT: The right eyebrow curls up into a very
confused expression.

00:47:34.928 --> 00:47:37.265
LIAM: Frumpkin comes over and also pisses on it.

00:47:38.485 --> 00:47:39.347
LAURA: That's gross.

00:47:44.167 --> 00:47:46.111
TALIESIN: Oh, for god's sakes. You can't reason
with angry people.

00:47:46.111 --> 00:47:48.746
LAURA: I give a pastry to him.

00:47:48.746 --> 00:47:50.040
MATT: (sounds of disgust)

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.036
LAURA: It's good to eat.

00:47:51.036 --> 00:47:56.950
MATT: As you're shoving this pastry into his face,
you can see right now, he appears demoralized,

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:05.889
ready to lash out at the first moment's notice,
and has seemed to have calmed a bit from the

00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:12.494
confusion of the displays in front of him, but
doesn't seem to be buying into any of what you're

00:48:12.494 --> 00:48:13.648
saying at the moment.

00:48:13.648 --> 00:48:14.954
LIAM: I shake it and put it away.

00:48:14.954 --> 00:48:17.282
LAURA: Can he understand us? Can you understand
me?

00:48:17.282 --> 00:48:18.421
SAM: It walks away.

00:48:19.231 --> 00:48:20.564
MATT: "I can understand this."

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:21.979
(gasps)

00:48:21.979 --> 00:48:23.594
MARISHA: Oh, he does speak Common.

00:48:23.594 --> 00:48:24.280
LAURA: That's great.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:26.383
TALIESIN: Should I expedite this?

00:48:26.963 --> 00:48:27.628
TRAVIS: Please.

00:48:27.628 --> 00:48:28.631
LIAM: Can you, yeah?

00:48:30.271 --> 00:48:33.571
TALIESIN: Come on, friend. We just need to ask you
a few questions and we'll let you be on your way,

00:48:33.571 --> 00:48:38.394
as long as there's nothing too inappropriate
happening. Devil's Tongue.

00:48:40.764 --> 00:48:41.765
LAURA: Devil's Tongue.

00:48:43.485 --> 00:48:44.631
MATT: That is a...

00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:48.151
TALIESIN: Wisdom save, second level.

00:48:48.151 --> 00:48:56.988
MATT: That would be a nine. That does not succeed.
Okay. You watch the eyes gloss over for a second.

00:48:56.988 --> 00:49:01.105
Wait, hold on a second. Where's my Player's
Handbook? Do you have it real fast?

00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:02.017
LAURA: Oh I do.

00:49:03.477 --> 00:49:04.683
MATT: Here I'll grab this one real fast.

00:49:04.683 --> 00:49:05.568
LAURA: Sorry, I was sitting on it.

00:49:05.568 --> 00:49:07.257
MATT: Double-check one more thing.

00:49:07.257 --> 00:49:09.211
TALIESIN: Are you trying to weasel out of my--

00:49:11.491 --> 00:49:16.068
MATT: I am trying to confirm. One of the racial
traits of the elves, if I recall, is they have--

00:49:16.068 --> 00:49:18.040
LAURA: Oh, a resistance to charm?

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:18.763
TALIESIN: Or advantage.

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:22.359
MARISHA: Half-elves did. I remember team
half-elves did.

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:24.631
MATT: Yep. Advantage on saving throws on being
charmed.

00:49:24.631 --> 00:49:25.590
TALIESIN: So you get one more roll.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:26.446
MATT: I do.

00:49:26.446 --> 00:49:27.472
TRAVIS: Roll low, roll low!

00:49:27.472 --> 00:49:28.842
MATT: That's going to be a 12.

00:49:29.512 --> 00:49:31.963
TALIESIN: It's a wisdom save, so it's ten plus my
wisdom modifier?

00:49:33.193 --> 00:49:33.999
MATT: It's eight plus-- yeah.

00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:35.712
TALIESIN: So, that's 13.

00:49:35.712 --> 00:49:36.269
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:49:36.269 --> 00:49:42.332
MATT: 13. Still fails. All righty. So as the eyes
glass over for a minute, the snarling and the

00:49:42.332 --> 00:49:44.426
tension in the muscles relax for a minute.

00:49:44.426 --> 00:49:52.422
TALIESIN: We're not with the empire. We're private
individuals just trying to get by. We wandered

00:49:52.995 --> 00:49:57.269
into a lot of chaos, so we just want to know what
we're getting wrapped up in right now.

00:49:57.269 --> 00:50:03.003
MATT: "Untie me."

00:50:03.003 --> 00:50:04.908
MARISHA: No.

00:50:04.908 --> 00:50:07.332
LAURA: You attacked us.

00:50:07.332 --> 00:50:12.298
MATT: "You rushed me and began to assault me."

00:50:12.298 --> 00:50:15.477
LAURA: No, we didn't! You came at us with your
sword out.

00:50:15.477 --> 00:50:19.017
LIAM: I cast a spell so I could try to understand
your tongue.

00:50:19.017 --> 00:50:25.870
MATT: He keeps looking at you. It's ignoring the
rest of them. It goes, "What happened to the

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:26.610
"Beacon?"

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.042
TALIESIN: What's the Beacon?

00:50:28.042 --> 00:50:31.506
MATT: "The Beacon." It looks around.

00:50:31.506 --> 00:50:33.450
LIAM: It's under a dirty rag.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.504
MATT: Right. It's just glancing about.

00:50:35.504 --> 00:50:38.469
TALIESIN: It's right there. Is it important?

00:50:38.469 --> 00:50:40.021
MATT: "Yes. Very."

00:50:40.021 --> 00:50:46.196
TALIESIN: Why? I'm just trying to understand,
friend. Help me help you.

00:50:46.196 --> 00:50:54.749
TRAVIS: You Jerry Maguire motherfucker. Help me,
help you.

00:50:54.749 --> 00:51:03.926
MATT: "We are here to retrieve the Beacon from the
empirical bastards in Zadash. We had it. I have

00:51:03.926 --> 00:51:13.554
"it. I don't know what happened to my companion,
but, so far, I am successful. And I need it."

00:51:13.554 --> 00:51:15.658
TALIESIN: What is the beacon for?

00:51:15.658 --> 00:51:21.067
MATT: "The beacon is part of our culture. The
beacon allows the rebirth."

00:51:21.067 --> 00:51:23.572
TALIESIN: The rebirth of what?

00:51:23.572 --> 00:51:25.495
MATT: "Of our people."

00:51:25.495 --> 00:51:31.167
LAURA: That's important. People need to be born.

00:51:31.167 --> 00:51:36.744
TALIESIN: This all sounds very complicated to me.
I am personally of the opinion that we just let

00:51:36.744 --> 00:51:37.312
everything go.

00:51:37.312 --> 00:51:45.044
MARISHA: Do you mean rebirth or do you mean
reanimate? Let's be honest here.

00:51:45.044 --> 00:51:48.374
MATT: It doesn't even pay attention to Beau.

00:51:48.374 --> 00:51:49.950
TALIESIN: My friends are your friends.

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:55.069
TRAVIS: I've got one job on this ship. It's
stupid, but I'm going to do it!

00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:58.480
(laughter)

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.868
TALIESIN: You're making a very, very good
argument, and my friends are your friends. We're

00:52:01.868 --> 00:52:02.614
all here to help.

00:52:02.614 --> 00:52:11.399
MATT: "The Beacons are sacred. I have lived four
lifetimes. As long as the Beacons remain, me and

00:52:11.399 --> 00:52:13.773
"my people will live more."

00:52:13.773 --> 00:52:18.396
LAURA: Do you make babies still?

00:52:18.396 --> 00:52:19.686
MATT: "We do."

00:52:19.686 --> 00:52:24.304
LAURA: Okay. And they live as long as the Beacon
lives too?

00:52:24.304 --> 00:52:29.255
MATT: "The souls continue. With each rebirth, the
memories retain."

00:52:29.255 --> 00:52:35.234
LIAM: What is your intention for the people in
this empire, this kingdom?

00:52:35.234 --> 00:52:38.551
MATT: "What is the intention of the empire?"

00:52:38.551 --> 00:52:42.958
LIAM: No, your people's intention, for all those
who live here.

00:52:42.958 --> 00:52:51.050
MATT: "We live. We worship. We learn. We die. We
are reborn until we are perfect."

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.513
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

00:52:53.513 --> 00:52:55.292
MATT: "We find more Beacons."

00:52:55.292 --> 00:52:57.236
LAURA: There's more of them?

00:52:57.236 --> 00:53:02.202
MARISHA: Is this thing what we saw take out half
the Zauber Spire?

00:53:02.202 --> 00:53:10.351
MATT: "No. That was my companion." You see at this
point, now, as friendly as it has been, there's

00:53:10.351 --> 00:53:11.174
this look of,

00:53:11.174 --> 00:53:17.098
"I might be saying too much and I don't trust the
most of you still.”

00:53:17.098 --> 00:53:24.486
TALIESIN: Sorry to tell you, but I think your
friend may have got hit on the end of something

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:33.019
fierce and may not have made it. I thought I saw
someone fly by and take him out. I'm sorry.

00:53:33.019 --> 00:53:34.205
MATT: "That's all right."

00:53:34.205 --> 00:53:36.230
MARISHA: Is it just the two of you or were there
more?

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:40.254
MATT: "For this mission, just the two of us. We
had help, but..."

00:53:40.254 --> 00:53:43.313
TRAVIS: Where are you trying to get to?

00:53:43.313 --> 00:53:45.938
MATT: "Out. Of the city."

00:53:45.938 --> 00:53:50.002
MARISHA: Who was your help, if it was just the two
of you?

00:53:50.002 --> 00:53:52.238
MATT: "I've said too much. Either kill me or let
me go."

00:53:52.238 --> 00:54:01.435
MARISHA: It has to be someone in the city. Who was
it? You don't tell us, we'll find out one way or

00:54:01.435 --> 00:54:03.498
another. I can tell you that right now.

00:54:03.498 --> 00:54:06.218
TALIESIN: We're trying to fight corruption in this
city in our own way. We just need to know who we

00:54:06.218 --> 00:54:08.786
can trust and who we can't.

00:54:08.786 --> 00:54:13.429
MARISHA: You can either help us get there faster,
or we'll just take the long goddamn way.

00:54:13.429 --> 00:54:18.803
MATT: "You cannot trust anybody in this city. You
cannot trust yourselves. Anyone who has not bound

00:54:18.803 --> 00:54:21.397
"themselves. They are the enemy."

00:54:21.397 --> 00:54:25.799
LAURA: To the beacon? What do you bind yourself
to?

00:54:28.114 --> 00:54:37.002
MATT: There's a moment of very tightly closed
eyes. The jaw clenches as he looks about.

00:54:41.785 --> 00:54:43.847
TALIESIN: I know my vote, but anybody else?

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:46.165
LAURA: I thought he was going to answer. I thought
he was going to answer!

00:54:46.165 --> 00:54:48.174
TRAVIS: You want to let him go, don't you?

00:54:48.174 --> 00:54:49.701
TALIESIN: Eh, not our problem.

00:54:49.701 --> 00:54:53.078
LAURA: I think we should let him go. I think he's
handsome.

00:54:53.078 --> 00:55:01.945
MARISHA: He looks like a good reward to me.
Unless, under one condition. You tell us who you

00:55:01.945 --> 00:55:03.934
were working with in here.

00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:06.726
TRAVIS: Yeah, tell us. We'll let you go.

00:55:06.726 --> 00:55:08.524
TALIESIN: That's fair.

00:55:08.524 --> 00:55:13.251
MATT: "I cannot. Our allies in the empire are
short on the list."

00:55:13.251 --> 00:55:15.760
MARISHA: Is it Kara? Dolan?

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.416
TRAVIS: Ulog? Checking his face for reactions to
any of them.

00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:20.322
MARISHA: Exactly. Anything? Any reactions?

00:55:20.322 --> 00:55:21.976
MATT: That would be an insight check.

00:55:21.976 --> 00:55:23.246
TRAVIS: Can I help her?

00:55:23.246 --> 00:55:25.157
MARISHA: Yeah, can me and Fjord tag team this?

00:55:25.157 --> 00:55:26.677
MATT: Sure.

00:55:28.247 --> 00:55:31.718
MARISHA: Yeah, let's just each roll. We're just
going down the list.

00:55:34.994 --> 00:55:36.079
Fucking fuck.

00:55:36.079 --> 00:55:36.915
TRAVIS: 15?

00:55:36.915 --> 00:55:39.162
MARISHA: Better than me. 13.

00:55:39.162 --> 00:55:40.385
MATT: 13.

00:55:43.055 --> 00:55:45.021
SAM: Whispers on a 15?

00:55:47.091 --> 00:55:49.549
MATT: He's not in a very strong place. The charm
spell is--

00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:51.040
TALIESIN: Charm spells are mean.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.192
LAURA: How long does charm spell work?

00:55:52.192 --> 00:55:52.968
TALIESIN: Like an hour.

00:55:52.968 --> 00:55:54.239
LAURA: That's great. I've got it, too.

00:55:54.239 --> 00:55:56.199
TALIESIN: I can do two people.

00:55:56.298 --> 00:56:01.116
SAM: Liam, what are you looking forward to in
Chicago? Is it the sausages? The brats? The

00:56:01.116 --> 00:56:02.370
deep-dish?

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:05.358
LIAM: Yeah, you know that deep-dish pizza there.

00:56:05.358 --> 00:56:10.215
TRAVIS: Yeah, I feel like we've kept him up long
enough. We don't have to get him out, we just have

00:56:10.215 --> 00:56:14.491
to give him the chance to get out. I think we
should do that. He's given us everything.

00:56:14.491 --> 00:56:16.603
MATT: "And give me the beacon."

00:56:16.603 --> 00:56:20.916
MARISHA: What? He hasn't told us shit.

00:56:20.916 --> 00:56:24.610
LAURA: Will the beacon hurt people, though?

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:25.702
MATT: "No."

00:56:27.654 --> 00:56:29.831
LAURA: I'm going to insight check him.

00:56:29.944 --> 00:56:31.274
MATT: Sure.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:37.236
LAURA: 14.

00:56:37.236 --> 00:56:39.996
MATT: 14. Kind of hard to read on this one.

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:41.804
LIAM: What will you do if we say no?

00:56:44.278 --> 00:56:49.314
MATT: "I will strike you down where you stand and
take it. It's too important."

00:56:49.314 --> 00:56:55.451
TALIESIN: That's rude. I'm going to start moving
towards untying him unless anyone's got any--

00:56:55.451 --> 00:56:59.067
MARISHA: Just leave him. He can get out himself.
He's a smart guy.

00:57:01.167 --> 00:57:03.988
TALIESIN: If we're all good--

00:57:04.093 --> 00:57:09.631
LIAM: We leave him only if we leave the beacon
with the Gentleman, but if we leave him on his own--

00:57:09.631 --> 00:57:12.932
LAURA: (gasps) Was it the Gentleman? Is he who
helped you in?

00:57:12.932 --> 00:57:14.997
MARISHA: Ooh, was it the Gentleman?

00:57:14.997 --> 00:57:18.946
TALIESIN: Insight check. Do I get advantage
because he's friends with me?

00:57:18.946 --> 00:57:21.802
MATT: Yeah, I'll say. Yeah. Why not?

00:57:21.802 --> 00:57:23.838
SAM and TALIESIN: Double insight.

00:57:23.838 --> 00:57:26.033
LAURA: Ooh, that's not bad.

00:57:26.033 --> 00:57:27.732
TALIESIN: That's not bad. 21.

00:57:27.732 --> 00:57:28.745
MATT: 21.

00:57:28.824 --> 00:57:37.412
SAM: More whispers! Just whispers. It's all
whispers. Oh, guys. D&amp;D Beyond, right?

00:57:37.412 --> 00:57:39.020
LAURA: I mean, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:42.704
SAM: What is there to say that hasn't already been
said by me?

00:57:42.704 --> 00:57:50.449
TALIESIN: Personally, this seems like more than I
feel like taking on right now. I say we walk away,

00:57:50.449 --> 00:57:54.104
and you'll know that our silence means that we
were trustworthy in the first place.

00:57:54.104 --> 00:57:56.727
LAURA: And then you can be our friends later.

00:57:56.727 --> 00:58:01.752
MATT: "And you'll leave the beacon? Free me. Give
me the beacon."

00:58:01.752 --> 00:58:08.143
MARISHA: We could pawn this thing. Right now.
It'll be off of our tail in like two minutes.

00:58:08.143 --> 00:58:10.133
TALIESIN: Have you ever pawned anything before?

00:58:10.133 --> 00:58:13.436
LIAM: I think that this thing is a great
responsibility.

00:58:13.436 --> 00:58:18.433
TRAVIS: We removed his armor. We should give him
something to leave in so he's not just walking

00:58:18.433 --> 00:58:19.798
buck through the city.

00:58:19.798 --> 00:58:21.630
TALIESIN: Now we're getting silly.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:26.187
MARISHA: What if he comes back and destroys us
with this thing in six months? Two months?

00:58:26.187 --> 00:58:30.330
LAURA: He won't. He likes us, right? You won't do
it? Will you promise not to hurt us later?

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:34.589
TRAVIS: No, he just said he's going to kill us if
we don't give it to him.

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.328
LAURA: But what if we give it back though?

00:58:38.328 --> 00:58:42.082
MATT: "You give it back. We go our separate ways.
I run."

00:58:42.612 --> 00:58:44.646
LIAM: I think we should kill him.

00:58:44.646 --> 00:58:46.411
TRAVIS: Really?

00:58:47.081 --> 00:58:49.508
LIAM: Seems dangerous to me.

00:58:51.217 --> 00:58:53.652
LAURA: Oh, man. This is a really tough one.

00:58:53.652 --> 00:58:58.683
MARISHA: And super different than five seconds ago
when you said we should just let him go.

00:58:58.683 --> 00:59:04.105
TRAVIS: Why don't we leave it up to him? We untie
him, he comes at us bros, we take him down. We're

00:59:04.105 --> 00:59:05.769
giving him a chance at freedom.

00:59:05.769 --> 00:59:06.923
LAURA: What about the beacon?

00:59:06.923 --> 00:59:09.319
TRAVIS: He doesn't get the beacon.

00:59:09.319 --> 00:59:11.793
TALIESIN: He's not going to leave without the
beacon.

00:59:11.793 --> 00:59:14.455
LAURA: I think we give him the beacon and we walk
away.

00:59:17.195 --> 00:59:19.543
TRAVIS: He'll come after it. I know.

00:59:19.543 --> 00:59:25.021
LAURA: Maybe you can look at the beacon one more
time and try to see what it is, and then we can

00:59:25.021 --> 00:59:26.324
give it back to him.

00:59:26.324 --> 00:59:30.059
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that. No?

00:59:30.059 --> 00:59:32.550
MARISHA: Does it scare you that much?

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:33.577
LIAM: It does.

00:59:33.577 --> 00:59:35.154
LAURA: Can I look at the beacon?

00:59:35.154 --> 00:59:38.430
TALIESIN: Did he get worried when we said we were
going to take a look at it one more time?

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.939
MATT: He didn't seem to flinch.

00:59:40.939 --> 00:59:43.893
MARISHA: If it's that scary, then what do you want
to do with it?

00:59:43.893 --> 00:59:46.936
TRAVIS: Can anybody else concentrate on it?

00:59:49.136 --> 00:59:54.266
LIAM: If we leave this gentleman here and take the
beacon, it becomes his life's work to find us.

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.124
TRAVIS: Agreed.

00:59:56.124 --> 01:00:01.240
LIAM: So we either leave him and it, or we take it
and kill him.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.275
TALIESIN: Agreed.

01:00:03.941 --> 01:00:06.042
MARISHA: Or we can take it now and kill him
later.

01:00:06.042 --> 01:00:08.012
TALIESIN: No.

01:00:08.012 --> 01:00:11.184
MARISHA: Just saying, it could be like a fun game.

01:00:11.184 --> 01:00:13.346
TALIESIN: You first.

01:00:13.346 --> 01:00:17.276
TRAVIS: I won't speak for anybody in the group,
but I'm not taking his life. So, if someone feels

01:00:17.276 --> 01:00:23.672
motivated, I'll just walk over this way. And I
start walking back the way we came.

01:00:25.022 --> 01:00:27.219
LAURA: (whispers) Give it back to him.

01:00:28.259 --> 01:00:30.105
LIAM: I don't-- why are you--

01:00:30.105 --> 01:00:31.217
LAURA: You have it!

01:00:31.217 --> 01:00:33.468
LIAM: I don't. It’s on the ground under the dirty
rag, <i>ja</i>.

01:00:33.468 --> 01:00:35.047
LAURA: Oh, it is? I go and look at it.

01:00:35.047 --> 01:00:39.602
MATT: Okay, as you pull the cloth up and look, the
grey light energy spills out from underneath, and

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:47.577
you watch as it looks over, and it can see it now.
Its eyes go wide, and you feel the soft undulating

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:51.267
low hum to it.

01:00:51.267 --> 01:00:54.964
LAURA: (hums) I hum back at it.

01:00:54.964 --> 01:00:58.294
MATT: Okay, you match the tone.

01:00:59.633 --> 01:01:02.303
LAURA: What does he do when we’re looking at it?

01:01:02.303 --> 01:01:06.090
TALIESIN: I walk over and scrape my radiant sword
against the orb.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:08.413
LIAM: I'm going to take a few steps back.

01:01:08.413 --> 01:01:10.901
MATT: As you do, he's like (growling).

01:01:10.996 --> 01:01:15.496
TALIESIN: Just seeing. Just going to give it a
little tap. I’m not cutting it, I'm just tapping it.

01:01:15.496 --> 01:01:22.881
MATT: Okay, it taps. It sounds like you're tapping
some sort of a stone or rock.

01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:24.799
TALIESIN: Does the radiant energy have any effect
on it?

01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:27.526
MATT: No, it does not.

01:01:27.526 --> 01:01:32.455
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know what it is. And if
you're not going to look, what use do we have for it?

01:01:33.121 --> 01:01:34.369
LAURA: Yeah.

01:01:34.369 --> 01:01:37.343
MARISHA: Look, I know some people. Why don't we
bag this thing up and we'll take it right over to--

01:01:37.343 --> 01:01:42.157
LIAM: These two individuals were responsible for
blowing a hole in that tower, yes?

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:44.559
MARISHA: Okay, I'm not talking about anything--

01:01:44.559 --> 01:01:49.323
LIAM: I'm not contradicting what you're saying,
I'm sorry. When you say, "What use do we have for

01:01:49.323 --> 01:01:51.725
"it?" It's a dangerous thing.

01:01:51.725 --> 01:01:55.759
LAURA: It didn't do it. The beacon wasn't the
thing that did it.

01:01:55.759 --> 01:01:56.999
MARISHA: New plan.

01:01:56.999 --> 01:01:58.376
LAURA: What?

01:01:58.376 --> 01:02:03.879
MARISHA: New plan. All right, we can't decide if
we should leave him, or take the thing, or take

01:02:03.879 --> 01:02:07.825
the thing but leave him, or kill him, or-- why
don't we take both him and the thing?

01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:09.657
TRAVIS: And what do we do with him?

01:02:09.657 --> 01:02:17.332
MARISHA: We go to the Cobalt Soul. Drop him off.
Front doorstep, leave a note, "You're welcome."

01:02:17.332 --> 01:02:20.124
LAURA: They're going to kill him, though.

01:02:20.124 --> 01:02:24.448
MARISHA: And apparently so are we? Or at least
talking about it?

01:02:24.455 --> 01:02:28.726
LIAM: What do they do there? I don't know much
about the Cobalt Soul. What can you tell me?

01:02:28.726 --> 01:02:35.498
MARISHA: They hold information. They've got a
decent amount of relics and spell books and things

01:02:35.498 --> 01:02:37.145
that they might know.

01:02:37.145 --> 01:02:39.215
TRAVIS: And it would endear us to the city.

01:02:39.215 --> 01:02:42.628
MARISHA: And they're technically a little bit
separate from the city. They're kind of not

01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:47.959
necessarily a part of the empire. They kind of
make sure the empire stays in check.

01:02:47.959 --> 01:02:50.192
TALIESIN: What's your name again, friend?

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:58.467
MATT: (sighs) This long, heavy sigh. Hearing all
this conversation and not knowing who to trust,

01:02:58.467 --> 01:03:02.232
even in spite of your spell. "Thuron."

01:03:02.492 --> 01:03:11.758
TALIESIN: Help us out, here. I'm Molly, and I--
Give my friends more to go with. Give them

01:03:11.758 --> 01:03:14.866
something, some reason to trust you, to make sure
that this is not going to come back and bite us in

01:03:14.866 --> 01:03:21.076
the ass. I mean, that's what we're looking for,
here, is a reason for us to be able to walk away.

01:03:22.055 --> 01:03:24.459
MATT: "Then walk away."

01:03:24.459 --> 01:03:28.545
LIAM: Question. When he said Thuron, did I hear
Thuron, or did I hear some other word, like eagle,

01:03:28.545 --> 01:03:31.330
or swift, or something?

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:34.686
MATT: The name itself does have meaning in
Undercommon. It is a name.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:38.150
LIAM: So I didn't hear Bob, right? Did it have
a--

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:50.532
MATT: No. The nuance to the word, from what you
can best understand, is-- it means "blessed second

01:03:50.532 --> 01:03:54.228
"born" is the best I can find the right words for
it.

01:03:54.228 --> 01:03:56.363
TALIESIN: Should send him to a monastery.

01:03:56.363 --> 01:03:57.820
TRAVIS: I'm good either way.

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:01.531
TALIESIN: How did you lose the thing in the first
place that you need to get it back?

01:04:02.891 --> 01:04:06.574
MATT: "It was taken from Xhorhas."

01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:08.409
TALIESIN: By who?

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:13.913
MATT: (chuckles darkly) Grins and looks up. "From
your fucking wizards."

01:04:13.913 --> 01:04:17.462
TALIESIN: I don't have any wizards. Well, I have
one wizard, but--

01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:20.070
LAURA: He doesn't like the other wizards.

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:22.783
TALIESIN: Well, to be fair, they are kind of
arseholes.

01:04:22.783 --> 01:04:26.438
LAURA: It was stolen from him! We should just let
him have it.

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:31.906
TALIESIN: How did they take it?

01:04:31.906 --> 01:04:33.860
MATT: "I don't know the details."

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.491
TALIESIN: Did they come to you?

01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:38.556
MATT: "I was just sent to retrieve it. I don't
know all the answers."

01:04:38.556 --> 01:04:40.088
TALIESIN: Sent by whom?

01:04:40.088 --> 01:04:41.794
MATT: "By my empress."

01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:44.552
TALIESIN: Your empress? Which empress would this
be?

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:46.484
MATT: "You don't know much, do you?"

01:04:46.484 --> 01:04:50.680
TALIESIN: I don't know anything. It's part of my
charm.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.625
MATT: "Empress Leylas Krynn."

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:54.961
LAURA: Leylas Krynn. Did I say it right?

01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:56.029
MATT: You did.

01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.880
LAURA: Nice!

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.094
LIAM: Same question.

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:00.139
MATT: Question was?

01:05:00.139 --> 01:05:02.199
LIAM: Context of the name. Anything?

01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:04.835
MATT: No, actually, that one is a proper name.

01:05:04.835 --> 01:05:06.946
TRAVIS: Leylas Krynn?

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:13.782
LAURA: Empress o' the drow? Or o' Marrow Valley?

01:05:13.782 --> 01:05:15.794
MATT: Well, the Marrow Valley is in the empire.

01:05:15.794 --> 01:05:18.321
LAURA: Oh, right. My facts are--

01:05:18.321 --> 01:05:20.179
MARISHA: The Dwendalian Empire?

01:05:20.179 --> 01:05:22.540
LIAM: No, we're in the Dwendalian Empire.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.119
MATT: You guys are in the Dwendalian Empire.

01:05:24.119 --> 01:05:26.190
MARISHA: No, wait, sorry. I meant Xhorhas.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:31.804
MATT: Xhorhas is to the east of here. It's the
wastes to the east of the Ashkeeper Peaks.

01:05:31.804 --> 01:05:32.835
MARISHA: Right.

01:05:32.835 --> 01:05:34.785
LAURA: So that's where you're from? Xhorhas?

01:05:34.785 --> 01:05:37.435
MATT: He nods, slowly.

01:05:37.435 --> 01:05:41.575
LAURA: And the Dwendalian Empire is fighting you?

01:05:43.618 --> 01:05:50.624
And they're stealing your babies? Because this is
the only way you can have babies?

01:05:51.186 --> 01:05:54.024
MATT: He stares at you, confused.

01:05:54.024 --> 01:05:56.467
LAURA: It all makes perfect sense to me.

01:05:56.467 --> 01:06:01.320
TALIESIN: I say we give him his armor, and that
thing, and be on our way. This is none of our concern.

01:06:01.398 --> 01:06:04.418
LAURA: I say we give him the thing and let him
walk around naked, because that's better.

01:06:04.418 --> 01:06:07.066
TALIESIN: That could be funny, too.

01:06:07.429 --> 01:06:14.027
LIAM: That's close to a death sentence. How about
we give him some crownsguard armor?

01:06:14.027 --> 01:06:16.562
TRAVIS: Fair call.

01:06:16.562 --> 01:06:18.503
LAURA: Then you can get out.

01:06:18.503 --> 01:06:20.892
MATT: "But you will give me the beacon?"

01:06:20.892 --> 01:06:25.775
TALIESIN: Well, we're not going to give it to you.
We're just going to leave it here. I think that's

01:06:25.775 --> 01:06:30.588
fair, we didn't give him anything. We found him,
he attacked us, we defeated him, we walked about

01:06:30.588 --> 01:06:31.768
our way.

01:06:31.768 --> 01:06:32.756
TRAVIS: I'm all right.

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:34.422
MARISHA: We're letting him leave without the
beacon?

01:06:34.422 --> 01:06:36.948
LAURA: We're leaving the beacon on the ground,
Beau.

01:06:36.948 --> 01:06:38.770
LIAM: I suggest, leave it for him.

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:40.434
MARISHA: And he's not going to take it?

01:06:40.434 --> 01:06:42.429
TALIESIN: We don't know what he's going to do.

01:06:42.429 --> 01:06:46.455
TRAVIS: (whispering dramatically) Yes, he's going
to take it.

01:06:47.995 --> 01:06:50.161
TALIESIN: I'm all right with this.

01:06:50.337 --> 01:06:52.352
LAURA: I'm okay with this.

01:06:52.352 --> 01:06:53.679
TALIESIN: Anyone else?

01:06:53.679 --> 01:06:55.347
LIAM: I defer to the group.

01:06:55.347 --> 01:06:57.410
SAM: I'm drunk, 120 feet away.

01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:00.270
(laughter)

01:07:02.103 --> 01:07:05.738
TALIESIN: Unless you've got a strong opinion
otherwise, Caleb, on that thing.

01:07:05.738 --> 01:07:06.704
LIAM: Say what?

01:07:06.704 --> 01:07:09.079
TALIESIN: Unless you've got a strong opinion on
that thing otherwise.

01:07:09.079 --> 01:07:13.948
LIAM: I am able to tell a great many things about
a great many things, and that is beyond me.

01:07:13.948 --> 01:07:16.341
LAURA: Maybe you should stare at it some more.

01:07:16.341 --> 01:07:18.987
TALIESIN: You don't have to stare at it some more.
If it's beyond you, then it's beyond me.

01:07:18.987 --> 01:07:21.596
TRAVIS: Unless you really want to. Huh? Do you? Do
you?

01:07:21.596 --> 01:07:22.581
LIAM: I do not.

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:24.000
TRAVIS: Open the door.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.726
TALIESIN: I say we just let it go.

01:07:25.726 --> 01:07:27.275
TRAVIS: (singing) Take a look...

01:07:27.275 --> 01:07:29.469
LAURA &amp; MARISHA: (singing) It's in a book, Reading
Rainbow!

01:07:29.469 --> 01:07:32.562
TALIESIN: Okay, we're getting into singing. No.
I'm calling it, then?

01:07:32.562 --> 01:07:35.413
MARISHA: I still say we load up both of these
guys.

01:07:35.413 --> 01:07:39.010
LAURA: I pull out-- oh wait, you know what, I
think I don't have full armor for the crownsguard

01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:42.067
because I gave them away. I gave them back.

01:07:42.067 --> 01:07:43.756
MATT: Yeah, you returned them.

01:07:43.756 --> 01:07:45.234
LAURA: We don't got no crownsguard armor.

01:07:45.234 --> 01:07:46.949
TALIESIN: Just give him his bits.

01:07:46.949 --> 01:07:52.710
MARISHA: Okay, he definitely does not get a secret
disguise to help him get through the city.

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:56.716
TRAVIS: We're giving him everything but the black
boots, the sword and the sheath and his money.

01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:58.185
LIAM: We're taking his shit.

01:07:58.185 --> 01:07:59.901
TALIESIN: Give him just the armor.

01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:01.864
LAURA: He gets his armor back. But you don't have
the shoes, okay?

01:08:01.864 --> 01:08:04.195
TALIESIN: We'll leave it right next to the bit.

01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:08.705
MARISHA: Just saying, it feels like we're leaving
an opportunity in the sewer.

01:08:08.705 --> 01:08:12.309
TALIESIN: There are good opportunities and bad
opportunities, and this one is giving me the

01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:16.738
vibration that perhaps we should just leave him
be.

01:08:16.738 --> 01:08:20.649
LAURA: And he's going to remember us and love us.
He's going to be our best friend.

01:08:20.649 --> 01:08:24.451
TALIESIN: Well, he's going to be a little
irritated at me in about half an hour. I'm going

01:08:24.451 --> 01:08:30.629
to start fraying the rope just a bit, so that
it'll be breakable with a little bit of work. Are

01:08:30.629 --> 01:08:31.643
we off?

01:08:31.643 --> 01:08:33.725
MATT: Okay, are you fraying it with your sword?

01:08:33.725 --> 01:08:36.242
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Just give it a little--

01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:43.470
MATT: The-- (trails off and chuckles)

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:46.397
SAM: Yes!

01:08:46.397 --> 01:08:49.570
MATT: The moment the rope breaks--

01:08:49.570 --> 01:08:52.174
TALIESIN: I wasn't going to break it, I was just
going to fray it.

01:08:52.174 --> 01:08:58.528
MATT: I know. But as you begin to pull, you notice
that, all this time that's been happening, the

01:08:58.528 --> 01:09:07.807
ropes in the back have gotten looser and looser.
He uses that point to grab the blade and swing

01:09:07.807 --> 01:09:14.031
around and pull it up against you. "I'm sorry, I
need your help."

01:09:14.031 --> 01:09:15.855
LAURA: He can do that when he's charmed?

01:09:15.855 --> 01:09:19.754
MATT: He's not cutting him, he's just grabbing,
going, "I'm sorry, I need your help," and is

01:09:19.754 --> 01:09:25.946
holding you now against the wall, looking at the
rest of you, and says, "Leave me."

01:09:25.946 --> 01:09:28.009
LAURA: That's what we’re doing! Jesus!

01:09:28.009 --> 01:09:30.421
TALIESIN: We were literally just doing that. And
boy, I've got to tell you that you are <i>really</i>

01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:33.201
overestimating their fondness for me right now.

01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:35.510
MATT: He pushes you off.

01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:38.956
TALIESIN: (laughs) Your stuff's over there.

01:09:41.045 --> 01:09:44.651
MATT: He rushes over and pushes the cloth off the
beacon real fast, picks it up and holds it.

01:09:44.651 --> 01:09:46.427
LAURA: I go (hums).

01:09:47.187 --> 01:09:50.277
MATT: Goes over and starts picking up the armor.

01:09:50.392 --> 01:09:51.356
MARISHA: Nope!

01:09:51.356 --> 01:09:52.862
TRAVIS: Yeah, we gave him the armor.

01:09:52.862 --> 01:09:54.212
LAURA: Yeah, we gave it back to him.

01:09:54.212 --> 01:09:55.415
SAM: It's <i>very</i> clear.

01:09:55.415 --> 01:09:57.235
TRAVIS: Yeah. Not the boots, not the sword, not
the gold.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:59.002
SAM: They said it four or five times.

01:09:59.002 --> 01:10:04.183
MATT: He puts on the armor. Puts on the mask. Puts
on the leg armor. Takes the beacon.

01:10:04.183 --> 01:10:07.842
LAURA: Don't run out the same exit that we do,
okay?

01:10:07.842 --> 01:10:10.322
MATT: Turns around and darts deeper into the
sewers.

01:10:10.322 --> 01:10:12.108
SAM: (whispers) That's the way we were going to
go.

01:10:12.108 --> 01:10:18.321
TALIESIN: I'm going to say, right now, that was
the easiest 20 platinum I've ever made in my

01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:20.101
entire life.

01:10:20.101 --> 01:10:21.849
LAURA: I mean, we just made so much money.

01:10:21.849 --> 01:10:24.161
MARISHA: Should we follow him? See where he's
going?

01:10:24.161 --> 01:10:25.996
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

01:10:25.996 --> 01:10:28.269
MARISHA: Just saying, maybe there's some cool
portal or something.

01:10:28.269 --> 01:10:29.622
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:10:29.622 --> 01:10:31.243
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:10:31.243 --> 01:10:33.109
MARISHA: How are they getting in and out, man?

01:10:33.109 --> 01:10:38.228
TALIESIN: I think he probably has some thing.
Whatever they do.

01:10:38.228 --> 01:10:42.713
LIAM: He left all his shit-- his armor he's
wearing, but all his other shit was left around?

01:10:42.713 --> 01:10:43.988
MATT: Other shit you have, yes.

01:10:43.988 --> 01:10:44.813
LIAM: We scooped it up?

01:10:44.813 --> 01:10:45.998
LAURA: It's in the bag.

01:10:45.998 --> 01:10:48.122
MARISHA: Is he heading deeper into the sewers the
way the spiders were?

01:10:48.122 --> 01:10:50.043
MATT: Yeah.

01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:55.106
TALIESIN: Why are you so keen on this one? I mean,
that was a lot. I don't want to get involved in

01:10:55.106 --> 01:10:57.541
that. That's crazy.

01:10:58.295 --> 01:11:02.709
LAURA: This is wars between empires. Do you really
care?

01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:08.355
MARISHA: I don't care about wars between empires,
I just like having more information. For later.

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.659
TRAVIS: We should get back to the Song and Supper
Inn.

01:11:10.659 --> 01:11:12.376
LAURA: You mean the Leaky Tap.

01:11:12.376 --> 01:11:17.862
TRAVIS: Song and Supper. See if Dolan’s there.

01:11:17.862 --> 01:11:19.710
LAURA: Oh.

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:21.663
TRAVIS: We are short one, you know.

01:11:21.663 --> 01:11:22.738
LAURA: Ulog.

01:11:22.738 --> 01:11:24.268
MATT: You hear a shout in the distance.

01:11:24.268 --> 01:11:25.523
TALIESIN: Let's roll.

01:11:25.523 --> 01:11:26.588
LAURA: Go, go, go, go.

01:11:26.588 --> 01:11:31.185
MATT: In the direction that you're traveling,
echoing down that way. And you see a flash of

01:11:31.185 --> 01:11:37.540
firelight, torchlight in the distance. You hear a
(hiss) and the sound of weapons clanging--

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.323
LIAM: Where he went?

01:11:39.323 --> 01:11:40.761
MATT: Yeah, in the direction he went.

01:11:40.761 --> 01:11:42.785
LAURA: Oh, he was going in the direction we were
going.

01:11:42.785 --> 01:11:49.504
MATT: And then it goes quiet, and you hear voices
say, "We got him! We got him!" And other voices,

01:11:49.504 --> 01:11:55.057
and around the corner up ahead you can see a
little bit of torchlight flickering against the

01:11:55.057 --> 01:11:56.456
wall.

01:11:56.456 --> 01:11:58.976
LIAM: Well, whatever it is, the empire just got it
back.

01:11:58.976 --> 01:12:01.519
MARISHA: I should have just strapped him up.

01:12:01.519 --> 01:12:03.211
TALIESIN: Do we want to end this really quickly?

01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:05.239
TRAVIS: End it?

01:12:05.239 --> 01:12:07.516
TALIESIN: We could go over and get involved in
that, since you seemed so keen--

01:12:07.516 --> 01:12:08.750
MARISHA and LAURA: No.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:10.289
TALIESIN: Oh, now you don't want to.

01:12:10.289 --> 01:12:14.119
MARISHA: We had control of it when it was still in
our hands. We don't have control anymore.

01:12:14.119 --> 01:12:19.205
LIAM: Also, as a sidebar, if we want the other
half of our earlier plan to work, we need to get

01:12:19.205 --> 01:12:23.520
to Dolan, we need the crownsguard inside Sutan's
house as quickly as possible.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.360
MARISHA: What did you say, you said we're down
one?

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.736
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ulog.

01:12:26.736 --> 01:12:28.079
MARISHA: What happened to Ulog?

01:12:28.079 --> 01:12:29.414
LAURA: (gasps)

01:12:29.414 --> 01:12:35.227
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah. Well, in the fray of the Richter
coming in, he lunged at her and put a little gem

01:12:35.227 --> 01:12:38.560
in her mouth. They exploded.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.666
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye on the path to make sure
nobody's coming down our direction.

01:12:42.666 --> 01:12:46.441
MATT: Okay. Hand me the object, please. The item
sheet.

01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:48.696
SAM and LAURA: Oh.

01:12:48.696 --> 01:12:51.379
LIAM: That could have easily been a blank piece of
paper.

01:12:51.379 --> 01:12:52.252
TALIESIN: But it wasn't.

01:12:52.252 --> 01:12:53.258
LIAM: It wasn't.

01:12:53.258 --> 01:12:54.404
LAURA: You should have looked at it more!

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:55.934
LIAM: I looked at it plenty.

01:12:55.934 --> 01:12:58.042
TALIESIN: He also technically memorized it.

01:12:58.042 --> 01:13:00.292
LIAM: Sure. All the question marks. I memorized
all the question marks.

01:13:00.407 --> 01:13:01.998
MATT: Doesn't work that way.

01:13:01.998 --> 01:13:04.155
LIAM: No, that was too mysterious.

01:13:04.155 --> 01:13:07.315
MATT: All right. There's some other muffled voices
down the way.

01:13:07.315 --> 01:13:09.008
TRAVIS: We've got to get out of here.

01:13:09.008 --> 01:13:10.750
MARISHA: Yeah. We don't want to be a part of
this.

01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:13.706
LAURA: But wait. Is there another exit? Or is it
back to the--

01:13:13.706 --> 01:13:15.881
MATT: It's back to the Tri-Spires.

01:13:15.881 --> 01:13:17.627
LAURA: Oh, shit.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.728
MATT: You hear footsteps.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:22.465
LIAM: All right, come on, we're going back up?
We're either fighting crownsguard or getting out

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:23.281
of here.

01:13:23.281 --> 01:13:25.212
TRAVIS: Yeah, we retreat.
Back the way we came.

01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:27.467
LAURA: (singing) Back it up, back it up, back it
up, back it up.

01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:30.325
SAM: What are you guys doing coming this way?! We
were going the other way!

01:13:30.325 --> 01:13:32.102
LIAM: It's a long story, go.

01:13:32.102 --> 01:13:33.508
TALIESIN: Bad at this.

01:13:33.508 --> 01:13:34.926
TRAVIS: Be quiet, we're being followed.

01:13:34.926 --> 01:13:36.026
SAM: Oh God!

01:13:36.026 --> 01:13:37.077
TALIESIN: Shh!

01:13:37.077 --> 01:13:38.737
(laughter)

01:13:38.737 --> 01:13:39.808
TRAVIS: Are you drunk, Nott?

01:13:39.808 --> 01:13:42.588
SAM: Not yet, but now I will be!

01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:50.734
MATT: You guys manage to head back up into the
Tri-Spires, back into the alleyway. As you close

01:13:50.734 --> 01:13:54.218
and lock the thing behind, a voice in the back of
the alley-- you guys watch as two crownsguard

01:13:54.218 --> 01:13:58.631
approach and go, "Hey! You!" And both pull their
swords to hold out in front, and one guy in the

01:13:58.631 --> 01:14:04.073
back, a third one arrives with a crossbow up to
you guys and says, "Hands up, weapons."

01:14:04.073 --> 01:14:06.788
LIAM: One, two, three? Don't know who you're
point-- oh, everybody?

01:14:06.788 --> 01:14:08.618
MATT: This would be all of you guys as you got out
of the sewer.

01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:10.730
SAM: We came back up. Oh, shit.

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:13.147
MATT: "What's your business?"

01:14:13.147 --> 01:14:16.235
LAURA: We were scared, things were falling from
the sky.

01:14:16.235 --> 01:14:18.389
LIAM: We took cover in the sewers.

01:14:18.389 --> 01:14:21.734
MARISHA: We were working at the festival. We're
just trying to get out, man.

01:14:21.734 --> 01:14:25.155
LIAM: Has the danger passed?

01:14:25.532 --> 01:14:30.725
MATT: (chuckles) I will say, since it wasn't a
single person, I'm going to ask for a deception

01:14:30.725 --> 01:14:34.358
roll from both of you, since you were the first
two to speak up.

01:14:34.358 --> 01:14:36.292
SAM: This is going to be great.

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:39.277
LIAM: 15.

01:14:39.885 --> 01:14:41.680
SAM: Why do you get advantage?

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.406
LAURA: Oh, I don't know why I took advantage.

01:14:43.406 --> 01:14:45.038
MATT: Yeah, don't get advantage. Roll one more.

01:14:45.038 --> 01:14:47.141
TALIESIN: Or you can take the lowest? No?

01:14:47.141 --> 01:14:48.330
LAURA: No, I don't want to do that.

01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:49.395
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:14:49.395 --> 01:14:53.784
LAURA: God damn it. Nine plus-- 12.

01:14:53.784 --> 01:14:55.466
MATT: And you rolled a--

01:14:55.466 --> 01:14:56.911
LIAM: 15.

01:14:56.911 --> 01:15:04.516
MATT: They take a moment. "Get out, we're
investigating." They move in, and they don't take

01:15:04.516 --> 01:15:08.912
their arms off of you. They get behind you and
move you out of the alley, into the street, and

01:15:08.912 --> 01:15:13.660
begin pushing you guys in the direction of the
outer wall of the Tri-Spires.

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:17.552
MARISHA: I say, sir, we have coworkers that were
working at the festival. Do you know anything

01:15:17.552 --> 01:15:19.439
about this attack?

01:15:19.439 --> 01:15:23.770
MATT: "We don't have any information at this time,
just get out, we're still checking. Please." You

01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:28.229
see the tower, still listing but held in place.
There's this flickering arcane energy underneath

01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:34.203
it that occasionally a wave goes (whooshing)
that's holding it aloft. You can see crownsguards

01:15:34.203 --> 01:15:39.295
are now-- some are shifting in the streets, going
and weaving through the buildings, and there's a

01:15:39.295 --> 01:15:43.570
bunch at the actual exterior wall, and they
eventually push you through, and lead you into the

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.484
central part of the city.

01:15:45.484 --> 01:15:48.244
LAURA: Are they still with us, or did they push us
away?

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:51.049
MATT: They pushed you away, and you guys are now
in the Interstead Sprawl.

01:15:51.049 --> 01:15:54.145
TRAVIS: We should stop by the Song &amp; Supper Inn,
see if we see a friendly face.

01:15:56.415 --> 01:15:59.360
LAURA: Let's go, before they realize we were down
there with the guy.

01:16:00.096 --> 01:16:07.136
MARISHA: As we walk, I'm going to ask Fjord, did
you catch any weird twitches, or any signs that he

01:16:07.136 --> 01:16:08.164
was lying?

01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:12.963
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't know if you saw, but his
eyes and his nostrils flared when we mentioned

01:16:12.963 --> 01:16:18.627
Ulog. I have a feeling our small dwarf friend was
involved in quite a bit more than we were aware of.

01:16:18.627 --> 01:16:25.260
MARISHA: You know, maybe we were assholes for not
noticing that him handing over his entire life

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.357
savings was a little suspicious.

01:16:27.357 --> 01:16:28.817
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.933
LAURA: Did he give that to us before?

01:16:30.933 --> 01:16:33.864
TRAVIS: Yeah, down in the basement when we were
talking.

01:16:33.864 --> 01:16:36.638
LAURA: He gave it to us already, or it was an
after sort of thing?

01:16:38.008 --> 01:16:39.944
TRAVIS: We didn't get it yet.

01:16:40.034 --> 01:16:41.448
MARISHA: I don't think we got it.

01:16:41.448 --> 01:16:43.617
LAURA: He was lying. He's not giving us any of the
money.

01:16:43.617 --> 01:16:45.212
TRAVIS: Even more reason to find Dolan.

01:16:45.212 --> 01:16:46.711
SAM: He showed it to us.

01:16:46.711 --> 01:16:48.900
TRAVIS: It was part of the pot, yeah.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.506
LAURA: I bet it exploded when he did. He
exploded.

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:58.154
LIAM: That is correct, right? We have not been
paid.

01:16:58.154 --> 01:16:59.845
MATT: No, you have not been paid.

01:16:59.845 --> 01:17:02.002
SAM: Except for the 112 platinum we just got.

01:17:02.002 --> 01:17:03.589
MARISHA: Which is pretty dope.

01:17:03.589 --> 01:17:04.566
LAURA: What-what!

01:17:04.566 --> 01:17:05.667
TRAVIS: How many gold is a platinum?

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:07.174
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Ten.

01:17:07.174 --> 01:17:08.532
TRAVIS: Damn!

01:17:08.532 --> 01:17:12.456
MATT: Who are the two that are keeping point,
leading you guys to the Song and Supper?

01:17:12.456 --> 01:17:13.731
TRAVIS: I am.

01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:15.255
MATT: Make a perception check, please.

01:17:18.443 --> 01:17:19.677
TRAVIS: 13.

01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:21.359
LAURA: I am, too.

01:17:21.359 --> 01:17:22.783
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:17:22.783 --> 01:17:23.896
LAURA: You asked for two people!

01:17:23.896 --> 01:17:26.075
MATT: I did.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:28.272
LAURA: Nobody else spoke up.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.701
14.

01:17:33.701 --> 01:17:38.456
MATT: 14, okay. You catch it first, and you
corroborate it. As you guys are heading down the

01:17:38.456 --> 01:17:44.463
road, near the sewer exit where you guys were
previously, there's a commotion gathering on the

01:17:44.463 --> 01:17:46.303
side of the street.

01:17:48.523 --> 01:17:50.297
SAM: Should we go check it out?

01:17:50.297 --> 01:17:51.579
TALIESIN: No.

01:17:51.639 --> 01:17:53.227
LAURA: Is there a crowd around it?

01:17:53.227 --> 01:17:56.262
MATT: There is a crowd gathering now, and you hear
gasps and people starting to shout.

01:17:56.262 --> 01:18:00.006
LIAM: I send Frumpkin scurrying between people's
legs into the crowd, put my hand on Beau's

01:18:00.006 --> 01:18:01.837
shoulder and go blind.

01:18:01.837 --> 01:18:04.449
MATT: You can see now, crownsguard are coming out
of the sewer, and they're dragging the dead body

01:18:04.449 --> 01:18:11.268
of the dark elf that you had seen below, and throw
it onto the ground. People are like (gasps), and

01:18:11.268 --> 01:18:15.131
they're looking at it, and some folks are talking.
"I've never seen one up close like this." There's

01:18:15.131 --> 01:18:21.509
this murmur in the crowd as all about the guards
are like, "Don't worry, don't worry. Both of them

01:18:21.509 --> 01:18:29.047
"are dead. You're safe now, thanks to the might and
the trust of the empire. The king keeps you safe."

01:18:29.318 --> 01:18:33.254
LIAM: Do Frumpkin and I see the doohickus? The
dodecahedron?

01:18:33.254 --> 01:18:36.646
MATT: You do see it being held by one of the
guards in one of his hands, yeah.

01:18:37.896 --> 01:18:42.452
MARISHA: All right, let's all be clear that
whatever the empire wants, they'll fucking take.

01:18:45.278 --> 01:18:50.486
SAM: Why don't we take that thing from them? Those
guys don't know what that is. Let's go get it!

01:18:50.486 --> 01:18:55.171
MATT: Two of the guards pick the body up, and one
of them puts it over his shoulder, and all of them

01:18:55.171 --> 01:18:58.856
cluster together as the crowd follows them. Some
of them are taking sticks and poking at the body

01:18:58.856 --> 01:19:01.655
as it goes. The guards are like, "Please, stop,
no."

01:19:01.655 --> 01:19:07.266
LAURA: Can we run interference and try to trip the
guard and get the thing back?

01:19:07.266 --> 01:19:11.277
SAM: Sure, if we want it. Do we want it?

01:19:11.277 --> 01:19:13.458
TRAVIS: Oh my god, we're going to try and get it
<i>now?</i>

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:16.806
MARISHA: You can disguise yourself. You can
disguise yourself as Crick!

01:19:16.806 --> 01:19:20.684
LAURA: What if we go try to look at the body and
then we accidentally fall on one of the guards and

01:19:20.684 --> 01:19:24.162
we make him drop it and then Nott picks it up and
runs away?

01:19:24.162 --> 01:19:27.918
MARISHA: I'm definitely super injured, but this
sounds fun.

01:19:27.918 --> 01:19:31.396
MATT: They're heading in the direction of the
King's Hall, it looks like.

01:19:31.396 --> 01:19:33.883
LAURA: I run up and try to look at the body.

01:19:33.883 --> 01:19:37.157
MATT: Okay. So you move and weave into the crowd.

01:19:37.157 --> 01:19:41.407
LAURA: Whoa, what is that? Is that a dead body?
Whoa, I've never seen one of those!

01:19:41.407 --> 01:19:44.626
MATT: You push up and look, and the body has deep
lacerations all through the torso and back. It

01:19:44.626 --> 01:19:47.882
looks like they cut him until they were sure he
was dead.

01:19:47.882 --> 01:19:49.876
MARISHA: They're in an alleyway?

01:19:49.876 --> 01:19:53.429
MATT: They're heading down the street right now,
they're turning the corner heading down to the

01:19:53.429 --> 01:19:54.560
main thoroughfare.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.135
LAURA: Can I trip and fall right in front of the
guard that's carrying the thing?

01:19:57.135 --> 01:19:58.655
MATT: You can if you want to.

01:19:58.655 --> 01:20:00.671
LAURA: I’m going to trip and fall! Right in front
of him.

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:02.120
TRAVIS: We had it in our hands!

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.605
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

01:20:03.605 --> 01:20:07.688
LIAM: I’m going to cast Disguise Self as a
crownsguard and just follow. Just see what's

01:20:07.688 --> 01:20:08.944
happening.

01:20:08.944 --> 01:20:13.827
MARISHA: I'm going to parkour elf, get on the--
Elf? Monk, get on the roof of the nearest building.

01:20:13.839 --> 01:20:17.311
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check, just for the
hell of it. Just to see how fast you get up there.

01:20:17.451 --> 01:20:20.512
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. 16.

01:20:20.512 --> 01:20:22.149
MATT: 16? And make a stealth check, please.

01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:24.659
LAURA: Yeah, but now they want it, I want it back.
Because it hums.

01:20:24.659 --> 01:20:25.939
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:20:25.939 --> 01:20:27.285
ALL: Whoa.

01:20:27.285 --> 01:20:31.377
MATT: All right. As you dart off onto the rooftop
like Batman, you just vanish amongst the night sky.

01:20:32.606 --> 01:20:33.825
And you?

01:20:33.825 --> 01:20:36.916
LAURA: I'm tripping and falling in front of the
guard carrying the thing as I'm trying to look at

01:20:36.916 --> 01:20:37.987
the body.

01:20:37.987 --> 01:20:39.445
MATT: Okay. Make a deception check.

01:20:39.445 --> 01:20:41.641
SAM: I'm casting Mage Hand, just in case.

01:20:41.641 --> 01:20:44.342
LAURA: God damn it. Why deception? I'm just
falling.

01:20:44.342 --> 01:20:47.718
MATT: This is as you falling forward, "Ah!" and
make a scene.

01:20:47.718 --> 01:20:48.677
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.039
MATT: This is just to see how--

01:20:50.039 --> 01:20:51.883
LAURA: Oh, well, I rolled a five.

01:20:51.883 --> 01:20:57.847
MATT: Okay. So the guy's-- as you fall in front of
him, he's like, "Please, miss, move away." And two

01:20:57.847 --> 01:21:00.747
of the guards rush forward and start picking you
up and shoving you off to the side.

01:21:00.747 --> 01:21:02.793
LAURA: Oh, man. I want to trip him.

01:21:02.793 --> 01:21:04.326
MARISHA: Where's Nott? Where are you?

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:08.148
SAM: I'm just following behind. Behind Jester, by
30 feet or so.

01:21:08.148 --> 01:21:12.565
MATT: More people are coming out now and gathering
the crowd around, to see them pull this dead Crick

01:21:12.565 --> 01:21:16.755
through the street. Word's getting around and
people are--

01:21:16.755 --> 01:21:21.929
LAURA: As they try to pull me away, I'm going to
try to hook my foot around the ankle of the guard

01:21:21.929 --> 01:21:25.685
carrying the thing and, as I'm standing up, try to
trip him to the ground.

01:21:25.685 --> 01:21:31.265
MATT: Okay, I will say make a dexterity check, if
you don't mind. Just a straight dexterity check.

01:21:31.265 --> 01:21:33.506
TRAVIS: What is the matter with you?

01:21:33.785 --> 01:21:35.253
LAURA: 21.

01:21:35.253 --> 01:21:42.417
MATT: 21! You barely manage to--Your foot doesn't
quite reach, but your tail does. As it scoops

01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:45.027
around his ankle: (yelps). He falls back and
lands--

01:21:45.027 --> 01:21:47.348
LIAM: Don't drop it! Don't drop it!

01:21:47.348 --> 01:21:48.678
MATT: And you are disguised as--?

01:21:48.678 --> 01:21:50.754
LIAM: As a crownsguard. I was walking alongside.

01:21:50.754 --> 01:21:53.231
MATT: Okay. Okay!

01:21:53.231 --> 01:21:54.868
MARISHA: Come on, come on, come on!

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:57.365
MATT: Okay. And you catch it. The guy starts
getting back up.

01:21:57.365 --> 01:22:01.216
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry! That hurt my tail
so much. I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:05.351
MATT: He grabs you by the front of your armor and
goes, "You need to get out of our way."

01:22:05.438 --> 01:22:09.533
LAURA: I'm sorry. It just looked so inter-- I'm
really impressed with how well you took down that

01:22:09.533 --> 01:22:11.041
guy, though!

01:22:11.041 --> 01:22:13.690
MARISHA: I follow Caleb as he traces around, but
on the roof.

01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.851
MATT: Okay. That guy pushes you off--

01:22:15.851 --> 01:22:17.870
TALIESIN: I'm standing with Fjord, in shock and
horror.

01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:19.933
TRAVIS: Yeah, just full, "Ah."

01:22:19.933 --> 01:22:21.574
MATT: He starts looking around the ground.

01:22:21.574 --> 01:22:24.412
LIAM: I start doing that thing where I was taking
steps, but not walking with them. And then I

01:22:24.412 --> 01:22:26.128
started walking backwards.

01:22:26.128 --> 01:22:28.346
(laughter)

01:22:28.346 --> 01:22:31.936
MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check, because you're
holding a glowing, undulating device.

01:22:31.936 --> 01:22:33.649
LIAM: I thought it was, like, black and glowing.
It’s white and glowing?

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:35.104
MATT: It's like a deep grey.

01:22:35.104 --> 01:22:37.529
TALIESIN: I swear we just had this conversation.
What changed?

01:22:37.529 --> 01:22:40.872
LIAM: Pretty good for me. Pretty good for me.
That's 14.

01:22:40.872 --> 01:22:41.854
MATT: 14?

01:22:41.854 --> 01:22:43.780
LIAM: Yeah. Dressed as a crownguard.

01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.421
MATT: Okay.

01:22:45.421 --> 01:22:50.551
MARISHA: I crouch down on the roof above Caleb,
and I go (bird coo).

01:22:50.551 --> 01:22:51.766
SAM: May I--?

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:52.845
MATT: You may.

01:22:52.845 --> 01:23:00.756
SAM: Seeing Caleb walk away with the object, I'm
going to cast Silent Image, and make the image of

01:23:00.756 --> 01:23:05.825
the object, glowing, about 30 feet away from them
on the ground. (dissonant humming)

01:23:05.825 --> 01:23:07.354
MATT: So there's two of them, currently.

01:23:07.354 --> 01:23:08.566
SAM: Yeah, I guess.

01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:12.216
LIAM: One in my hand, and one on the ground. But
I've got it like this.

01:23:12.216 --> 01:23:14.649
MATT: What's your spell DC?

01:23:14.649 --> 01:23:21.747
SAM: My spell DC is-- It's plus-- Oh, sorry, hold
on. Silent Image is-- Come on, D&amp;D Beyond.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.676
MATT: What's your intelligence modifier?

01:23:23.676 --> 01:23:25.404
SAM: It's plus three is my spellcasting modifier.

01:23:25.404 --> 01:23:26.668
MATT: Okay, so it'd be 13, would be your spell
DC.

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:28.083
SAM: Okay.

01:23:28.083 --> 01:23:33.347
MATT: Okay. I will say that the two guards that
noticed you leave with the object, even though

01:23:33.347 --> 01:23:36.547
they're coming over to be like (confused
stuttering). They see the other object over there,

01:23:36.547 --> 01:23:40.787
and they both get confused and look at the two. As
they're standing, trying to figure out what to do,

01:23:40.823 --> 01:23:44.620
they both split. One goes for the object over
there; one goes for Caleb. He's catching up to you

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:48.568
and goes like, "Hey! Hey. We're going to the--
We're going to the hall of the king."

01:23:48.568 --> 01:23:51.613
LIAM: Oh, I just want to get it away from the
crowd. This thing seems dangerous to me.

01:23:51.613 --> 01:23:57.548
MATT: "Right, right. Well, come on." And the two
of you turn around; he guides you to turn around.

01:23:57.548 --> 01:23:59.402
You're now walking, trailing behind.

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:01.909
LIAM: Let's just-- a little further back, like
another ten feet. I don't know if this is going to

01:24:01.909 --> 01:24:03.533
blow. It's better that it's just you and me.

01:24:03.533 --> 01:24:07.777
MATT: All right. Some other townsfolk are starting
to, like, walk up to get a look at this object now

01:24:07.777 --> 01:24:09.473
that the crownsguard are holding.

01:24:09.473 --> 01:24:10.825
LIAM: So what's around?

01:24:10.825 --> 01:24:15.496
MATT: So, you're off, you're behind the group. The
large cluster is moving maybe about 60, 70 feet

01:24:15.496 --> 01:24:21.468
ahead of you now. You are back-- when it was
turning onto the main street is where all this

01:24:21.468 --> 01:24:26.193
transpired. So you're a little bit off, past the
corner of where they are. They're just starting to

01:24:26.193 --> 01:24:32.307
curve out of sight. And you are walking with the
guard now in that direction, slowing down. The

01:24:32.307 --> 01:24:35.554
other object that you caused the illusion of is
the other way, and the guard has about 100 feet or

01:24:35.554 --> 01:24:41.471
so to walk to get to it. And he's partway there
and he hasn't quite learned what the scenario is.

01:24:41.471 --> 01:24:43.989
LIAM: Yeah, good, so I cast Friends on this
crownsguard.

01:24:43.989 --> 01:24:45.192
MATT: Okay.

01:24:45.192 --> 01:24:47.671
TRAVIS: Does that make it drop?

01:24:47.671 --> 01:24:49.139
LIAM: No. It's not concentration.

01:24:49.139 --> 01:24:50.270
MATT: What's the saving throw on it?

01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:51.973
LIAM: It is--

01:24:51.973 --> 01:24:53.495
SAM: It just gives you--

01:24:53.495 --> 01:24:55.175
MATT: Is there a saving throw?

01:24:55.175 --> 01:24:57.001
SAM: Advantage to charisma rolls.

01:24:57.001 --> 01:25:02.015
LIAM: Yeah, advantage to charisma rolls. If he’s
not under attack or thinks he’s threatened.

01:25:02.015 --> 01:25:03.776
MATT: Oh, all right, cool.

01:25:03.776 --> 01:25:06.378
LIAM: Advantage on charisma checks at one creature
of your choice that isn't hostile towards you.

01:25:06.378 --> 01:25:08.499
MATT: Yeah. And he is not currently hostile
towards you.

01:25:08.499 --> 01:25:16.210
LIAM: So listen. Don't die for this. I will take
this. Just walk ahead. This thing blew a hole in

01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:18.041
the side of that tower.

01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:20.452
MATT: Make a deception check, with advantage.

01:25:20.452 --> 01:25:21.904
MARISHA: Come on, Caleb.

01:25:25.239 --> 01:25:26.354
LIAM: Okay. 15.

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:27.181
MATT: 15?

01:25:27.181 --> 01:25:28.284
LIAM: The first was a one.

01:25:28.314 --> 01:25:33.395
MATT: As soon as you say that-- Oh, shit! Thank
god for Friends.

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:35.988
TRAVIS: (stabbing sound)

01:25:36.301 --> 01:25:40.276
MATT: As soon as you say that blew the hole in the
tower, you watch him take an instinctual step

01:25:40.276 --> 01:25:43.702
back. "Right. I'll go catch up."

01:25:43.702 --> 01:25:47.462
LIAM: We've seen balls of fire take out half a
city block.

01:25:47.462 --> 01:25:52.345
MATT: "Right." He darts ahead, looking over his
shoulder as he starts to try and join up with the crowd.

01:25:53.875 --> 01:25:55.508
LIAM: I turn into an alley.

01:25:55.592 --> 01:25:57.597
LAURA: (pigeon cooing) Cover it up. Walk away.

01:25:57.597 --> 01:25:59.233
TALIESIN: You can turn into an alley?

01:25:59.233 --> 01:26:03.420
MATT: Make another stealth check, because there's
other folk now that are coming out and are seeing

01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:06.789
this. The other guard has just now gotten up to
the illusion.

01:26:06.789 --> 01:26:09.034
LIAM: Wait, are there other guards around me? I'm
sorry.

01:26:09.034 --> 01:26:11.470
MATT: No. There's the other guard that was paired
with him that went off to go after the illusion

01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.123
that Nott had created.

01:26:13.123 --> 01:26:14.715
MARISHA: Trying to avoid the paparazzi.

01:26:14.715 --> 01:26:17.002
TRAVIS: Molly and I are running after Caleb, since
we saw the other guard.

01:26:17.002 --> 01:26:20.325
SAM: I'm staying put, and as soon as the guard
gets close, I'll make it slowly rise up into the

01:26:20.325 --> 01:26:24.487
sky, just like 12, 13 feet up.

01:26:24.487 --> 01:26:26.480
LIAM: Does that give me advantage?

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.725
MATT: What spell is this?

01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:31.258
SAM: This is Silent Image. I can move it. I just
can't make it make a sound.

01:26:31.258 --> 01:26:36.557
MATT: Yeah, so as it drifts up in the air, the
guard goes, "Uh." Looks around. All the about 17

01:26:36.557 --> 01:26:42.252
or so townsfolk had began to converge to look up
at it. They're all like, "Ooh." They're all

01:26:42.252 --> 01:26:50.427
excited looking at it. It's definitely distracting
the current group. The one guard there is like,

01:26:50.427 --> 01:26:54.504
"Go, back! Back!" to everybody. He's starting to
look nervous, because he doesn't know why it's

01:26:54.504 --> 01:27:00.148
lifting up, and he's uncertain about what's
happening. You make a stealth check. You're only

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:04.303
getting it because they're distracted by that. To
try and duck into the alley unseen.

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:06.403
LAURA: Am I near him at all? Can I give him a
blessing?

01:27:06.403 --> 01:27:07.576
LIAM: Stealth?

01:27:07.576 --> 01:27:08.952
MATT: You're not quite close enough.

01:27:08.952 --> 01:27:10.238
LIAM: It is a nine.

01:27:10.238 --> 01:27:11.886
TRAVIS: Nein! Sorry.

01:27:11.886 --> 01:27:17.210
MATT: So you duck into the alleyway, not sure if
you've been seen. All right. What are the rest of

01:27:17.210 --> 01:27:18.448
you guys doing?

01:27:18.448 --> 01:27:20.470
TRAVIS: Molly and I are trucking after where Caleb
just went through.

01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:22.667
TALIESIN: Walking at a very gentle pace in that
direction.

01:27:22.667 --> 01:27:23.530
MATT: All right.

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:26.268
MARISHA: I'm on the roofs, been tracking Caleb
this whole time. On the roof.

01:27:26.268 --> 01:27:31.283
MATT: Right. So you guys go behind. As you begin
to approach, you can see there are two teenage

01:27:31.283 --> 01:27:40.003
kids, a boy and a girl, that are dressed nice
enough. Both are like, "Did you see what he was

01:27:40.003 --> 01:27:43.522
"holding? I want to see it." They both go into the
alleyway after Caleb as well.

01:27:43.522 --> 01:27:45.527
LIAM: Are there any doors or anything in here?

01:27:45.527 --> 01:27:51.442
MATT: In this alleyway? There's no immediate door.
It looks like there's a solid wall on one side,

01:27:51.442 --> 01:27:58.938
and an arch that leads into a small walkway that
leads between the buildings. If you keep going,

01:27:58.938 --> 01:28:03.740
then it splits off into a T intersection of
alleyways, right or left.

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.105
LIAM: I'll take the left.

01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:06.392
MATT: You take a left? All right.

01:28:06.392 --> 01:28:07.568
LIAM: And just keep going.

01:28:07.568 --> 01:28:10.261
MARISHA: I drop down in front of the kids
Batman-style.

01:28:11.743 --> 01:28:13.326
TALIESIN: Stay in school!

01:28:13.326 --> 01:28:17.616
MARISHA: Don't take my fucking line before I get a
chance to say it!

01:28:17.616 --> 01:28:20.413
TALIESIN: So sorry. I'm so sorry!

01:28:20.413 --> 01:28:22.714
MARISHA: Close, but different motive.

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:24.944
MATT: So you land and they both go, "Ah!"

01:28:24.944 --> 01:28:26.812
MARISHA: Whatcha buying, kids?

01:28:28.372 --> 01:28:29.553
MATT: "Uh-- uh--"

01:28:30.341 --> 01:28:32.473
MARISHA: You know that shit will fucking kill you,
right?

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:33.821
TALIESIN: Oh goddamn it.

01:28:33.821 --> 01:28:36.724
MATT: Make an intimidation check. With advantage.

01:28:36.724 --> 01:28:37.957
MARISHA: With advantage?

01:28:37.957 --> 01:28:40.645
MATT: With advantage because you just dropped down
from the sky.

01:28:40.645 --> 01:28:46.928
MARISHA: Jesus, a natural one and a four. So
five.

01:28:46.928 --> 01:28:50.170
MATT: Okay. The two kids go (scoffs).

01:28:50.170 --> 01:28:56.855
MARISHA: I take out my staff and I say: Do your
parents know you're out this late? Or are you

01:28:56.855 --> 01:28:58.913
trying to prove something?

01:28:58.913 --> 01:29:04.321
MATT: "It's not worth it. Come on." The girl,
(sniffs) "Fine." They both turn and walk away,

01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:05.814
kicking the dirt a little bit.

01:29:05.814 --> 01:29:08.307
MARISHA: And just for Taliesin, I say: Stay in
school!

01:29:08.412 --> 01:29:10.065
(laughter)

01:29:10.868 --> 01:29:12.339
MATT: Perfect.

01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:14.297
TALIESIN: I've know you too long now. I feel
sick.

01:29:14.297 --> 01:29:15.776
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:29:15.776 --> 01:29:17.307
TALIESIN: What a perfect stay in school moment.

01:29:17.307 --> 01:29:21.606
MARISHA: I'm going to stealth and try to track
back towards Caleb. But make sure no one else is

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:23.235
also following him.

01:29:23.235 --> 01:29:29.034
MATT: Okay. All right, so you guys dart off into
another alleyway. You still do hear guards

01:29:29.034 --> 01:29:31.930
shifting, but you start hearing other people are
talking. People are starting to go back to their

01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:40.170
homes. They're whispering to each other. Listening
in, you hear phrases being said, like, "The city's

01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:43.528
on lockdown. This is crazy. I'm supposed to be
leaving tomorrow!"

01:29:43.528 --> 01:29:46.333
LAURA: (whispers) This is a lockdown? Shit.

01:29:47.833 --> 01:29:52.597
MATT: You start hearing whispers about the gala,
and like, "How many people were killed?"

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:57.026
"Oh, I heard like 100 people were murdered." 
"Serves them right, those fucking rich bastards."

01:29:57.026 --> 01:29:59.093
You know, passing conversations.

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:04.107
It's now, the buzz of the town, even this late at
night, as people are now either emerging to see

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:09.774
the scene, or are returning to their homes, seeing
what they have. But the crowd has dissipated, or

01:30:09.774 --> 01:30:14.746
at least the crowd has moved on towards the King's
Hall, and are probably in the process of trying to

01:30:14.746 --> 01:30:20.277
figure out what the fuck happened to the object
they were carrying. You guys manage to dart off to

01:30:20.408 --> 01:30:24.975
the side of the is the eastern end of the
Interstead Sprawl. You aren't apparently followed

01:30:24.975 --> 01:30:27.633
at the moment, but you're still holding this
glowing--

01:30:27.633 --> 01:30:29.349
LAURA: Can we put it in the bag?

01:30:29.349 --> 01:30:33.364
LIAM: Ordinarily, I would say yes, and I might
want to put something else in there. But for the

01:30:33.364 --> 01:30:36.585
time being, I don't understand this thing enough.

01:30:36.585 --> 01:30:39.160
LAURA: (mumbling) You want to put something else
in the bag?

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:41.160
SAM: (giggles)

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:48.587
LIAM: Let's table that for now. I'm worried what
will happen if this specifically goes into that bag.

01:30:48.686 --> 01:30:49.781
LAURA: Why?

01:30:49.781 --> 01:30:52.499
LIAM: Because that is an extra-dimensional
pocket.

01:30:52.499 --> 01:30:53.875
LAURA: Yes.

01:30:53.875 --> 01:30:57.696
LIAM: And I don't know what this is, and I am
worried that it could potentially create--

01:30:57.696 --> 01:31:00.312
LAURA: A black hole and suck us all in?

01:31:00.312 --> 01:31:06.901
LIAM: Sure, let's go with that. But maybe if we
could procure a lead box to put this inside of,

01:31:06.901 --> 01:31:11.661
that will shield it from any possible searching
that could happen for it.

01:31:11.661 --> 01:31:13.037
TRAVIS: A lead box?

01:31:13.037 --> 01:31:14.676
LIAM: A large, lead box, yeah.

01:31:14.676 --> 01:31:17.065
MARISHA: I don't think we should go back to the
Song &amp; Supper.

01:31:17.141 --> 01:31:19.526
TALIESIN: I have a hooded lantern we can put it in
in the meantime.

01:31:19.526 --> 01:31:20.975
SAM: It’s bigger than that.

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:26.244
MATT: It's about that large. It's got two handles
on each side. It looks like you're carrying a lantern.

01:31:26.363 --> 01:31:31.868
LIAM: We need to find Dolan fast. We need to, I'm
serious, find a lead box to put this thing in,

01:31:31.868 --> 01:31:35.118
because someone's going to want this very badly.

01:31:35.118 --> 01:31:38.442
TRAVIS: Let's split the party. It's always the
best idea. No, but seriously, we don't need

01:31:38.442 --> 01:31:40.026
everyone for both.

01:31:40.026 --> 01:31:46.653
MARISHA: Fjord and I found an additional cellar,
where we found that skeleton, behind the Leaky

01:31:46.653 --> 01:31:49.219
Tap. Doesn't look like anybody--

01:31:49.219 --> 01:31:51.927
SAM: I'm still doing illusion shit. Have I
finished that?

01:31:51.927 --> 01:31:56.747
MATT: All right, so at this point now, the guard,
who's down below, has called over like four other

01:31:56.747 --> 01:32:00.756
guards and they're all at the bottom of it. Some
of them are getting their crossbows ready to shoot

01:32:00.756 --> 01:32:02.324
if it does something.

01:32:02.324 --> 01:32:09.651
SAM: I'll make it inflate, and then Salvador Dalí,
start dripping. Just like (humming).

01:32:09.651 --> 01:32:12.411
MATT: As it swells and then behinds to drip, they
all start backing away. The guards start pushing

01:32:12.411 --> 01:32:17.609
people away. The guy that was originally carrying
it, with seven other guards, begins to approach

01:32:17.609 --> 01:32:23.325
the cluster. They have broken off from the
procession with the elf body, and they've now

01:32:23.325 --> 01:32:27.973
joined up with the other guard. He's like, "There
it is! Stay back; stay back." They're all

01:32:27.973 --> 01:32:32.116
nervously waiting for this thing, dripping, and
doing nothing, and they're all scared.

01:32:32.116 --> 01:32:37.695
SAM: It's going to start to boil and fizzle into
steam, and dissipate.

01:32:37.695 --> 01:32:42.193
MATT: It does, and there's a brief moment as
everyone holds their breath.

01:32:42.193 --> 01:32:43.401
TALIESIN: Tinkerbell.

01:32:43.401 --> 01:32:48.265
MATT: And you hear a couple of local townsfolk go
(scattered applause and cheers).

01:32:48.265 --> 01:32:51.473
(laughter)

01:32:51.473 --> 01:32:53.937
MATT: The guards all look at each other, very
confused.

01:32:53.937 --> 01:32:58.261
MARISHA: (announcer voice) Thank you for joining
us for Fantasma. The park is now closed.

01:32:58.371 --> 01:33:01.425
LIAM: I wish I could be a fly on the wall when
those wizards hear this story from the

01:33:01.425 --> 01:33:03.201
crownsguard, just like--

01:33:03.201 --> 01:33:07.928
MATT: (dopey guard voice) "I don't know. It just
flew in the air, grew big, and then made sauce and

01:33:07.928 --> 01:33:09.288
"disappeared."

01:33:09.288 --> 01:33:12.525
MARISHA: (dopey guard voice) "It was just like
that cat I kicked the other day."

01:33:12.525 --> 01:33:16.256
LIAM: (disinterested voice) "Yes, very good. Take
a lollipop from the bowl and get out."

01:33:16.256 --> 01:33:21.835
(laughter)

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:24.913
SAM: Then I'll try to rejoin them.

01:33:24.913 --> 01:33:28.522
MATT: Okay, you manage to catch up. You dart past
two teenage kids that are cursing to each other.

01:33:28.522 --> 01:33:33.405
They're both like, "Yeah, that woman was such a
bitch," as they pass by.

01:33:33.405 --> 01:33:34.349
SAM: I know who they're talking about.

01:33:34.349 --> 01:33:35.193
MATT: Yeah.

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:39.215
(laughter)

01:33:39.215 --> 01:33:44.035
MATT: At this point, when you guys are discussing
what to do, you hear the little-- Actually, we'll

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:49.318
say largely you don't hear, but you see Nott
appear at the cusp of your circle. You've caught

01:33:49.318 --> 01:33:51.361
up with the rest of them.

01:33:51.361 --> 01:33:53.617
SAM: What's going on? Where are we going?

01:33:53.617 --> 01:33:55.967
LAURA: We're going back to the Leaky Tap, I
think.

01:33:55.967 --> 01:34:01.070
TRAVIS: Yeah, how about Beau and I will go to the
Song &amp; Supper Inn and we'll meet you at the Leaky Tap.

01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:03.862
LAURA: Okay, and we'll try to find a box to put it
in.

01:34:03.862 --> 01:34:08.569
MARISHA: Nott, remember that additional cellar
behind the Leaky Tap?

01:34:08.569 --> 01:34:12.026
SAM: The secret cellar where I found-- nothing.
Where we found a skeleton.

01:34:12.026 --> 01:34:13.047
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:13.953
SAM: Yes.

01:34:13.953 --> 01:34:15.510
MARISHA: I think that might be safe.

01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:17.431
LIAM: You think the basement with a dead person is
safe?

01:34:17.431 --> 01:34:22.276
MARISHA: It was <i>super</i> dead. Like, no one's been
there for a <i>super</i> long time.

01:34:22.276 --> 01:34:23.565
TALIESIN: I like this plan.

01:34:23.565 --> 01:34:25.188
LIAM: What is a super long time? Like ten years?
What is that?

01:34:25.188 --> 01:34:26.588
SAM: Long enough for the body to decompose.

01:34:26.588 --> 01:34:29.949
MARISHA: Super clean bones. Like, at least, two
years, I'd say.

01:34:29.949 --> 01:34:32.385
LIAM: That's a conversation for another day. Let's
go.

01:34:32.385 --> 01:34:35.326
MATT: All right, so the two of you are making your
way to the Leaky Tap.

01:34:35.326 --> 01:34:37.173
TRAVIS: Song &amp; Supper.

01:34:37.173 --> 01:34:39.959
MATT: Song &amp; Supper, right. The rest of you guys
are going to the Leaky Tap, but finding a box on

01:34:39.959 --> 01:34:40.957
the way you said?

01:34:40.957 --> 01:34:43.328
TALIESIN: We're going to see if we can find, like,
a--

01:34:43.328 --> 01:34:45.197
LIAM: Just a shitty hardware store, man.

01:34:45.197 --> 01:34:49.128
MATT: At this point, it's past midnight, and most
of the market is closed.

01:34:49.128 --> 01:34:52.555
LAURA: Maybe Claudia has a lead box at her thing.

01:34:52.555 --> 01:34:55.625
MATT: You do still have a glowing beacon in your
hand.

01:34:55.625 --> 01:34:59.612
LIAM: Okay, well, I'm going to take my cloak off
and cover it.

01:34:59.612 --> 01:35:04.268
MATT: It does cover it up. It's a very faint bit
of glow that comes through the fabric, but it's

01:35:04.268 --> 01:35:06.486
enough where it probably won't be noticeable from
a distance.

01:35:06.486 --> 01:35:11.766
LIAM: I’ve changed my mind, I think it can wait
until morning, but for sure-- Well, if she has

01:35:11.766 --> 01:35:15.107
one, good, but it's a lot of disarray.

01:35:15.107 --> 01:35:20.144
LAURA: Yeah, but we need one. What if they try to
find it, like, tonight, though?

01:35:20.144 --> 01:35:23.705
LIAM: Well, then let's go break into a store and
get a lead box.

01:35:23.792 --> 01:35:27.732
SAM: Wait, wait, why does it need to be lead? I
mean, you can turn anything into lead, can't you?

01:35:27.732 --> 01:35:30.711
LIAM: Not that particular material.

01:35:30.711 --> 01:35:33.554
SAM: Oh. Why does it have to be that particular
material?

01:35:33.554 --> 01:35:39.036
LIAM: Because lead shields things from magical--
from divination magic.

01:35:39.648 --> 01:35:43.115
TALIESIN: Would they sell a lead box at a magic
shop?

01:35:43.115 --> 01:35:45.447
LAURA: Or even at the blacksmith's shop?

01:35:45.447 --> 01:35:51.563
MATT: It's possible. None of you are very
well-versed in the ways of blacksmithing or lead

01:35:51.563 --> 01:35:52.842
objects, so--

01:35:52.842 --> 01:35:54.348
SAM: Pumat would have something.

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:56.911
LIAM: But I would know that when I saw it. I know
alchemy, I know all sorts of materials.

01:35:56.911 --> 01:35:58.001
MATT: Yeah.

01:35:58.001 --> 01:36:00.298
TALIESIN: We need a safe, is what we need.

01:36:00.298 --> 01:36:03.804
MARISHA: I think we can wait until morning,
though. How's the city looking? Are people

01:36:03.804 --> 01:36:06.342
ransacking? Are there looters?

01:36:06.342 --> 01:36:07.868
MATT: There's no looters, no.

01:36:07.868 --> 01:36:09.427
MARISHA: Okay. It's not that bad.

01:36:09.427 --> 01:36:15.334
MATT: No, and at this point now, the streets are
fairly barren of crownsguard. They’ve all-- aside

01:36:15.334 --> 01:36:21.178
from the cluster that you saw moving through,
there's a whole bunch at the perimeter gates of

01:36:21.178 --> 01:36:24.917
the Tri-Spire, and where they would normally be
posted at the different corners of the streets,

01:36:24.917 --> 01:36:26.155
they are not.

01:36:26.309 --> 01:36:30.741
TALIESIN: Let's hide it with the skeleton for now.
We’ll put some of your thread on it?

01:36:30.741 --> 01:36:32.627
LAURA: Oh, that's smart.

01:36:32.627 --> 01:36:35.787
TALIESIN: And that way it’ll be down there,
unconnected to us just in case someone finds it,

01:36:35.787 --> 01:36:38.145
and if they do, we’ll know the minute they touch
it.

01:36:38.145 --> 01:36:39.356
SAM: Smart.

01:36:39.356 --> 01:36:40.498
LIAM: For now.

01:36:40.498 --> 01:36:41.708
TALIESIN: For now.

01:36:41.708 --> 01:36:43.848
LIAM: Good. That's it. That is a great idea.

01:36:43.848 --> 01:36:46.344
TALIESIN: Teamwork. Fine, let's do this.

01:36:46.344 --> 01:36:48.009
SAM: Look at us! We’re like a team.

01:36:48.009 --> 01:36:49.250
MARISHA: Break!

01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:50.642
SAM: Break?

01:36:54.162 --> 01:36:58.269
MATT: All right, so you two are heading to the
Song and Supper. Okay, and you guys are heading to

01:36:58.326 --> 01:37:05.394
the Leaky Tap? All right. So you head back. While
you guys are heading that direction, you head to

01:37:05.394 --> 01:37:09.534
the Song and Supper. You manage to make your way
there. It's still open. It's fairly empty on the

01:37:09.534 --> 01:37:15.793
inside, there's only two patrons that are present
at this hour. It seems like the commotion has

01:37:15.793 --> 01:37:19.896
drawn most of what clientele would have been in
there at the moment, and there’s only two patrons

01:37:19.896 --> 01:37:24.622
that are both halfway into their cups, and pretty
drunk or tired at this point. But you look around

01:37:24.622 --> 01:37:28.966
and you don't see Dolan, you don't see Horris, you
don't see Kara.

01:37:31.476 --> 01:37:32.717
TRAVIS: Nobody here.

01:37:32.738 --> 01:37:35.974
MARISHA: You think the whole damn thing was a
fucking distraction?

01:37:35.974 --> 01:37:38.247
TRAVIS: Sure feels like it, doesn't it?

01:37:38.247 --> 01:37:48.150
MARISHA: I really don't like being used. Who's at
the bar? Is there anyone at the bar?

01:37:48.150 --> 01:37:51.741
MATT: Yeah, there is the general barkeep there,
which would be--

01:38:12.201 --> 01:38:13.637
Clay Owens.

01:38:13.637 --> 01:38:15.253
MARISHA: Clay Owens?

01:38:15.253 --> 01:38:21.518
MATT: Yeah, he's a balding, portly gentleman,
middle age or so. As you walk in, he, "Aye, can I

01:38:21.518 --> 01:38:23.163
"get you something?"

01:38:23.163 --> 01:38:25.178
MARISHA: Hey Clay, how's it going? Long night?

01:38:25.178 --> 01:38:27.481
MATT: "All right. Crazy night, from what I'm
hearing."

01:38:27.481 --> 01:38:30.452
MARISHA: I know, right? Can I go ahead and get a
double to help with the night?

01:38:30.452 --> 01:38:32.463
MATT: "Aye, certainly. Here you go."

01:38:32.463 --> 01:38:39.440
MARISHA: Had anyone come in tonight? Any one of
the usuals? Seen Ulog? Seen Kara?

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:44.655
MATT: "No? No. Oh no, Ulog was in earlier this
evening."

01:38:44.655 --> 01:38:45.778
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:38:45.778 --> 01:38:55.098
MATT: "He was here for a while, and then left with
some friends. Think Dolan and his boy were in for

01:38:55.098 --> 01:38:59.907
"a bit. They rushed out in a hurry about an hour
ago?"

01:39:00.987 --> 01:39:04.353
MARISHA: All right. You didn't see them rush out
with anybody?

01:39:04.428 --> 01:39:06.294
MATT: "Just the two of them."

01:39:06.294 --> 01:39:08.574
MARISHA: Mention where they were going?

01:39:08.574 --> 01:39:14.159
MATT: "No, they just up and left. Figured they
were done for the evening. They looked a bit hurried."

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:18.659
TRAVIS: Not that we're looking for them, we're-- I
don't feel very well and I don't have money for a

01:39:18.659 --> 01:39:22.357
proper physician. I'm sure we could find someone
else.

01:39:22.357 --> 01:39:26.640
MATT: "Maybe. You could probably go to their home.
That's usually where they practice out of."

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:32.080
MARISHA: I think he got food poisoning from the
finger food at the gala. You should never trust that shit.

01:39:32.183 --> 01:39:34.621
MATT: "Better get there soon, then. It's kind of
late."

01:39:34.621 --> 01:39:35.707
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:39:35.707 --> 01:39:37.076
MARISHA: All right. Well, thanks, Clay.

01:39:37.076 --> 01:39:38.038
TRAVIS: Have a good night.

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:40.335
MATT: "No worries, here's your drink." He gives
you the shot.

01:39:40.335 --> 01:39:43.049
MARISHA: Slam it. Let's go.

01:39:43.049 --> 01:39:44.777
TRAVIS: Yeah. Want to check his house?

01:39:44.777 --> 01:39:46.848
MATT: "I don't-- That’ll be a silver."

01:39:46.848 --> 01:39:48.953
MARISHA: Oh, I give him a gold.

01:39:48.953 --> 01:39:52.432
MATT: He goes "I-- uh--"

01:39:52.449 --> 01:39:58.829
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, I was-- It's just the--
Just keep it. It's just the stress of the night.

01:39:58.935 --> 01:40:00.667
MATT: "Thank you kindly!"

01:40:00.667 --> 01:40:05.491
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm a little-- maybe next time,
it's a round on you, right?

01:40:05.491 --> 01:40:10.142
MATT: "Of course!" He tucks it away. "Thank you!"

01:40:10.142 --> 01:40:12.657
MARISHA: Okay, bye. All right, let's go.

01:40:12.657 --> 01:40:15.143
TRAVIS: You feeling that double?

01:40:15.143 --> 01:40:16.823
MARISHA: No, why?

01:40:16.823 --> 01:40:19.809
TRAVIS: Oh good. That's good. I just-- Damn, that
was impressive. Yeah.

01:40:19.809 --> 01:40:21.801
MARISHA: Oh, my tolerance is like--

01:40:21.801 --> 01:40:22.981
TRAVIS: Beast mode?

01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:25.535
MARISHA: It's at an unhealthy level. Let's go.

01:40:25.535 --> 01:40:27.570
TRAVIS: You want to go by Dolan's house?

01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:29.585
MARISHA: Yeah, let's see if those guys are there.

01:40:29.585 --> 01:40:35.126
MATT: Okay, as you guys quietly make your way
towards Dolan's house, as you approach, there's no

01:40:35.126 --> 01:40:39.027
light from the inside. Make a perception check,
both of you.

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:42.807
MARISHA: Natural 20!

01:40:44.017 --> 01:40:45.475
TRAVIS: And a 16.

01:40:45.583 --> 01:40:50.632
MATT: Nice! You both notice there is a quick bit
of movement on the inside even though the lights

01:40:50.632 --> 01:40:52.158
are out.

01:40:52.158 --> 01:40:54.129
MARISHA: Someone's hiding.

01:40:54.129 --> 01:40:59.752
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, I'll go up and knock. You want
to go around back?

01:40:59.752 --> 01:41:01.856
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, make sure they don't try and
run.

01:41:01.856 --> 01:41:06.006
TRAVIS: Yeah. I knock and say, it's Fjord with the
Mighty Nein, open up!

01:41:06.006 --> 01:41:09.940
MATT: There's a moment pause and the door opens up
very quickly with just enough space to let you in.

01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:11.529
Do you go in?

01:41:11.529 --> 01:41:12.777
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:41:12.777 --> 01:41:16.663
MATT: Okay, you head inside. It's dark in there,
but you have your dark vision, so you look around

01:41:16.663 --> 01:41:23.374
and it looks like Dolan and Horris are both in
there. Horris has a candle light with a side hood

01:41:23.374 --> 01:41:30.814
that's keeping it contained to a small area. Dolan
goes, "Oh, thank god you're okay! We're trying--

01:41:30.814 --> 01:41:32.612
"We don't know what to do."

01:41:32.612 --> 01:41:35.626
TRAVIS: It's all right. Take a breath. Is there a
back door to this place?

01:41:35.626 --> 01:41:37.497
MATT: "Through the bedroom."

01:41:37.497 --> 01:41:39.990
TRAVIS: Beau's going to be coming around the back,
make sure she gets let in.

01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:43.531
MATT: "Okay." Horris is in the process of taking
things and putting them into a sack. They are

01:41:43.531 --> 01:41:44.694
basically rapidly--

01:41:44.694 --> 01:41:46.052
TRAVIS: You're leaving?

01:41:46.052 --> 01:41:47.323
MATT: "We can't stay here!"

01:41:47.323 --> 01:41:48.496
TRAVIS: Why?

01:41:48.496 --> 01:41:52.935
MATT: "If they trace anything back to us, they're
going to string us up in front of the tower."

01:41:52.935 --> 01:41:59.399
TRAVIS: Take a deep breath, friend. Listen, Ulog
is dead. He sacrificed himself in a very brave

01:41:59.399 --> 01:42:05.065
moment. He threw himself at the Richter, threw a
gem in her mouth, and exploded in a Fireball.

01:42:05.065 --> 01:42:07.315
Listen, I think--

01:42:07.315 --> 01:42:09.334
MATT: "Great, so now we have a murder on our
hands, too."

01:42:09.334 --> 01:42:10.553
TRAVIS: I think--

01:42:10.553 --> 01:42:12.906
MATT: Horris goes, "Keep your mouth down!
Please!"

01:42:12.906 --> 01:42:17.656
TRAVIS: I don't think any of this leads back to
us. We still have to complete our mission.

01:42:17.656 --> 01:42:22.145
We got to make sure that Lord Sutan is implicated in
this, but right now we're clean.

01:42:22.265 --> 01:42:25.075
MATT: "At this point, that doesn't even matter. We
can't--"

01:42:25.075 --> 01:42:32.136
TRAVIS: The Richter's gone! You have a chance to
ascend to her seat! Wasn't that the plan?

01:42:32.136 --> 01:42:37.623
MATT: "Yes, but if there is any chance they can
bring that back to us-- maybe we leave town for a

01:42:37.623 --> 01:42:40.072
"short time. Maybe just go."

01:42:40.108 --> 01:42:45.482
TRAVIS: Stop. Don't be a coward in this moment. If
you want to help this city, if you want to help

01:42:45.482 --> 01:42:51.194
make the empire better, you're going to have to
stand strong. A little risk is going to come with

01:42:51.194 --> 01:42:56.993
this job, especially in that position. You knew
the risk going into this, didn't you? To put your

01:42:56.993 --> 01:42:59.948
money and your lives at risk?

01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:02.769
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.528
TRAVIS: 15.

01:43:06.528 --> 01:43:15.928
MATT: 15. He goes, "You're right, we should--" And
Horris goes, "No! What, do you want them to go

01:43:15.928 --> 01:43:20.836
"ahead and throw us in the dungeon? Is that what
you want? I understand what you're saying, but

01:43:20.836 --> 01:43:27.122
"none of us knew that the High-Richter was going to
be dead! I'm sure they have ways of tracing that

01:43:27.122 --> 01:43:34.687
"back. What good--" And Dolan goes, "Calm down.
Please. Maybe he's right, maybe they don't have a

01:43:34.687 --> 01:43:40.646
"way to bring it back. If we see this through--"
Horris takes the satchel and sets it on the table,

01:43:40.806 --> 01:43:45.953
puts the candle below it and walks up, grabs the
side of Dolan's shoulders, and says, "I

01:43:45.953 --> 01:43:55.919
"understand, but I don't want to lose you, and this
scares the shit out of me." They both take a

01:43:55.919 --> 01:44:04.899
moment and look at each other. Horris looks at you
and says, "I think you're right. Neither of us

01:44:04.899 --> 01:44:10.897
"know how to talk our way out of the guards if they
come by, we're not good liars."

01:44:10.897 --> 01:44:18.425
TRAVIS: I understand. Fortunately, in this
situation, you don't have much to lie about. You

01:44:18.425 --> 01:44:22.700
were here. You weren't at the Richter’s. You
weren't involved in it in any way. The Knights of

01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:27.177
Requital are going to take the fall for this, that
would be the only tie-in. Ulog is dead.

01:44:33.807 --> 01:44:37.295
You have a chance to do some real good here.

01:44:38.613 --> 01:44:53.093
MATT: Horris nods. "Okay. Then we stay." And Dolan
says, "No, I stay. Just in case things go wrong, I

01:44:53.093 --> 01:45:01.084
"want you safe and gone. If this is to be turned
around, I'm the one they're going to look to. I’m

01:45:01.084 --> 01:45:06.726
"the one who actually has the political influence
here. I'm the one who can talk and make a

01:45:06.726 --> 01:45:13.891
"difference, if that is to be done in the next few
days, or the next week. If you can just, for a

01:45:13.891 --> 01:45:21.918
"while, trust me and just leave. Is that okay?" He
looks to you, and Horris kind of--

01:45:30.758 --> 01:45:32.739
"Fine, but I'll come back soon."

01:45:33.984 --> 01:45:38.163
TRAVIS: We'll keep an eye out. I promise. If
anything needs to be shared between, you can rely

01:45:38.163 --> 01:45:41.093
on us to pass a message.

01:45:41.093 --> 01:45:52.258
MATT: Dolan nods. "Okay. I'm good. Sorry, Horris,
I don't need you for this. It would be stupid for

01:45:52.258 --> 01:46:00.466
"both of us, should anything go wrong, to be taken,
swept up by this. Okay? Trust me."

01:46:02.676 --> 01:46:03.856
TRAVIS: Are you in the house yet?

01:46:03.856 --> 01:46:05.042
MARISHA: Nope, I'm still out back.

01:46:05.042 --> 01:46:06.017
MATT: She's still out back.

01:46:06.017 --> 01:46:07.074
MARISHA: (whispers) Fjord? Are you dead?

01:46:07.074 --> 01:46:08.474
TRAVIS: That's Beau.

01:46:08.569 --> 01:46:10.881
MATT: Horris rushes off and opens the back door.

01:46:10.881 --> 01:46:14.668
MARISHA: While all this was going on, can I do a
quick little casing, intelligence to see if

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:18.087
there's any thrown-away trash, burned evidence, or
anything in the back?

01:46:18.087 --> 01:46:20.143
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:46:23.373 --> 01:46:28.376
MARISHA: Fucking-- fuck you, Gil. Six.

01:46:28.811 --> 01:46:30.416
TRAVIS: You love him or you hate him.

01:46:30.416 --> 01:46:32.130
LIAM: The big bad of campaign two.

01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:37.413
MATT: There's piles of trash that are pushed in
the corner. You look through and you don't find

01:46:37.413 --> 01:46:40.085
anything that catches your interest.

01:46:41.374 --> 01:46:48.351
TRAVIS: Dolan, I know Horris and you both are
worried. We're still going to need that payment.

01:46:48.351 --> 01:46:51.349
Our efforts have incurred some damages.

01:46:51.349 --> 01:46:57.376
MATT: Of course. I don't have Kara's, but I have
ours and I have Ulog's. He left that with us

01:46:57.467 --> 01:46:58.999
before he left tonight.

01:46:58.999 --> 01:47:00.371
MARISHA: Did he let me in?

01:47:00.371 --> 01:47:04.694
MATT: Yes. He let you in at this point. Horris
brought you in. He points over, too, and you can

01:47:04.694 --> 01:47:10.611
see there's a smaller sack and a larger one that's
more of a backpack that seems to the be one that

01:47:10.611 --> 01:47:14.192
Ulog left. He goes, "Take them, please. That's of
no use to us."

01:47:18.233 --> 01:47:20.364
At this point, Horris is letting

01:47:20.518 --> 01:47:24.357
Beauregard in, and knowing that it's just the two
of you, he puts his hand on your shoulder and

01:47:24.357 --> 01:47:28.216
says, "Keep him safe. Get him out if you can,
please.”

01:47:28.216 --> 01:47:31.094
TRAVIS: Anywhere you prefer? Is there a hiding
spot?

01:47:31.094 --> 01:47:34.147
MATT: "I don't know. Just out of the city. Just
out of the city for a week. That's all I ask."

01:47:34.147 --> 01:47:36.395
TRAVIS: Fair enough. We can do that.

01:47:36.395 --> 01:47:39.606
MATT: A cart rolls by and they all get very
quiet.

01:47:41.619 --> 01:47:46.228
MARISHA: There's a little town not far from here
called Alfield. It might actually have use for a

01:47:46.228 --> 01:47:48.919
doctor right about now.

01:47:48.919 --> 01:47:51.292
TRAVIS: Beau has experience with this area.

01:47:51.292 --> 01:47:53.397
MATT: "Maybe. Okay."

01:47:55.282 --> 01:48:05.935
MARISHA: Wait. Before you guys leave. It doesn't
matter based on what's just happened. Is there

01:48:05.935 --> 01:48:14.239
anything that you guys know that we didn't about
any other of the members of the Knights of

01:48:14.239 --> 01:48:23.437
Requital that might have a more invested interest
in an invasion or getting back at anyone in the

01:48:23.437 --> 01:48:27.333
Zauber Spire? Sorry. Yes. That was the right one.

01:48:27.333 --> 01:48:30.514
MATT: "Invasion? I'm confused."

01:48:31.534 --> 01:48:36.324
TRAVIS: I'm afraid Ulog may have had a larger game
to play.

01:48:36.324 --> 01:48:41.441
MATT: Horris slaps the shoulder of Dolan and says,
"I told you there was something up with that guy."

01:48:41.441 --> 01:48:43.949
TRAVIS: Why do you say that, Horris?

01:48:43.949 --> 01:48:49.817
MATT: "I just didn't trust him. I mean, it took a
while for us to be okay with each other, but he

01:48:49.934 --> 01:48:52.173
"was always on edge."

01:48:53.353 --> 01:48:57.377
TRAVIS: He left us in charge of finding justice
for his wife, and we intend to.

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:00.364
MATT: "That's something."

01:49:01.011 --> 01:49:05.050
MARISHA: Seems like you all had your own
individual motives for why you were part of the

01:49:05.050 --> 01:49:11.519
Knights of Requital. You sure yours was just
because you wanted to be the High-Richter?

01:49:11.519 --> 01:49:16.555
MATT: "Anywhere I could help change the law of the
town."

01:49:16.555 --> 01:49:18.457
TRAVIS: Do I believe him?

01:49:18.457 --> 01:49:20.357
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:49:22.922 --> 01:49:23.905
TRAVIS: 11.

01:49:23.905 --> 01:49:27.933
MATT: 11. Hard to read, but he seems forthright.

01:49:27.933 --> 01:49:35.944
TRAVIS: All right. Let's help Horris get out of
the city. Stay low. Stay here.

01:49:35.944 --> 01:49:40.910
MATT: "I will. Thankfully, when all this went
down, we were both in the Song and Supper, so at

01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:48.568
"least we have an alibi. I've just never done
something like this before. Pardon my nerves." You

01:49:48.568 --> 01:49:53.187
see his hands are literally shaking, and you see
notice now he is very nervous.

01:49:53.187 --> 01:49:54.888
TRAVIS: Have a drink. It’ll help with that.

01:49:54.888 --> 01:50:01.118
MATT: "I will." He goes off to the corner and
pulls out a small glass bottle of liquor. He comes

01:50:01.118 --> 01:50:06.638
over, and him and Horris give a very tight hug to
each other, and then separate. Dolan sits down,

01:50:06.638 --> 01:50:10.384
puts the drink on the table. “Thank you."

01:50:10.384 --> 01:50:14.179
TRAVIS: Of course. We'll have to regroup, and
we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

01:50:15.439 --> 01:50:16.521
MATT: "Go."

01:50:17.131 --> 01:50:18.557
TRAVIS: We leave.

01:50:18.656 --> 01:50:23.737
MATT: Horris comes with you guys towards the Leaky
Tap. You guys make your way to the Leaky Tap.

01:50:26.157 --> 01:50:27.567
LAURA: Yes, we do.

01:50:27.570 --> 01:50:29.859
TALIESIN: Before we go in, we're going to go to
the basement.

01:50:29.859 --> 01:50:31.035
MATT: Okay.

01:50:31.035 --> 01:50:33.767
LAURA: I'm going to go upstairs to try to talk to
Claudia.

01:50:33.767 --> 01:50:39.039
LIAM: I will say that on the walk, I would
instantly Identify the stone.

01:50:39.869 --> 01:50:41.887
MATT: Okay, so you will cast--?

01:50:42.107 --> 01:50:43.186
LIAM: Identify.

01:50:43.186 --> 01:50:44.206
SAM: The stone?

01:50:44.206 --> 01:50:45.457
LIAM: From Sutan's house.

01:50:45.457 --> 01:50:55.064
MATT: Oh, from Sutan's house, I got you. Yeah.
Here you go. A sending stone. One of two. You do

01:50:55.064 --> 01:50:56.501
not know where the other one is.

01:50:56.501 --> 01:50:59.103
SAM: Oh, intrigue.

01:51:01.203 --> 01:51:04.115
LAURA: Like we had? Like Vox Machina had?

01:51:04.237 --> 01:51:06.797
SAM: Who? What? Who are you talking about?

01:51:06.797 --> 01:51:10.454
LAURA: Oh, where you speak into it. Not like where
you hold onto it and you transport?

01:51:10.454 --> 01:51:16.107
MATT: No, not that. That was a gate stone. This is
essentially a means of communicating between two

01:51:16.107 --> 01:51:17.142
stones.

01:51:17.142 --> 01:51:18.682
LIAM: Once-a-day walkie-talkie.

01:51:18.682 --> 01:51:19.908
LAURA: Okay.

01:51:21.977 --> 01:51:28.011
MATT: You head down into the basement area beneath
the Leaky Tap. Once again, the guard is pretty

01:51:28.011 --> 01:51:36.664
sparse. You’ll see one guard walk past, but their
numbers seem to have been ushered elsewhere in the

01:51:36.664 --> 01:51:42.141
city. So you make it down there and you take
enough time that you eventually get the lock back

01:51:42.141 --> 01:51:46.101
open that you left. You head down into basement.
It's exactly how you left it.

01:51:46.101 --> 01:51:48.187
SAM: This is the place. Are you with us?

01:51:48.187 --> 01:51:49.523
LIAM: Yes, I am.

01:51:49.523 --> 01:51:52.770
SAM: This is the place I was talking to you about.
The skeleton’s right over there.

01:51:52.770 --> 01:51:54.870
TALIESIN: I say we put it behind the skeleton.

01:51:54.870 --> 01:52:00.054
LIAM: I go take a look at this skeleton. I would
like to try to ascertain how long this fucker has

01:52:00.054 --> 01:52:01.110
been here.

01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.898
MATT: Make a medicine check.

01:52:04.391 --> 01:52:09.026
LIAM: Yeah. Not great at all, like all my skill
rolls. Seven.

01:52:09.026 --> 01:52:14.142
MATT: A seven? Hard to tell. I mean, just looking
at the level of decomposition, it's been here a while.

01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:18.246
TALIESIN: Do I get anything from it? Is it a
normal human skeleton?

01:52:18.246 --> 01:52:23.515
TRAVIS: "Do I get anything from it?" You creepy
bastard.

01:52:23.515 --> 01:52:29.849
MATT: Make a medicine check to see if you can
ascertain the creature type.

01:52:33.345 --> 01:52:34.377
TALIESIN: Ten.

01:52:34.377 --> 01:52:39.870
MATT: It definitely doesn't appear to be anything
beyond humanoid. The size, the shape of the

01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:44.119
skeleton, it's a standard humanoid skeleton, but
you’re not able to tell anything beyond that.

01:52:46.899 --> 01:52:51.919
LIAM: Here's the thing. We can hide this here.
It's a calculated risk, which I am fan of,

01:52:52.097 --> 01:53:01.833
generally. But my thread, my magic would let me
know if someone-- no, never mind.

01:53:01.833 --> 01:53:03.332
SAM: What?

01:53:03.332 --> 01:53:10.778
LIAM: No. I can put a magical lock on the door to
this basement as well. As well as an alarm.

01:53:10.778 --> 01:53:12.747
TALIESIN: An alarm and a lock?

01:53:12.747 --> 01:53:14.617
SAM: What would that do?

01:53:14.617 --> 01:53:18.977
LIAM: Well, the thread will allow me me to know if
someone I didn't want to be in here came in here.

01:53:18.977 --> 01:53:20.607
(distant clattering)

01:53:20.607 --> 01:53:22.067
MATT: That's upstairs.

01:53:22.067 --> 01:53:24.477
LAURA: That's me upstairs,
talking to Claudia.

01:53:24.477 --> 01:53:28.610
And the spell will stop your average Joseph from
coming in here.

01:53:28.648 --> 01:53:30.784
TALIESIN: I like this plan. It's a good plan.

01:53:30.784 --> 01:53:34.799
SAM: All right. Very smart, as always.

01:53:34.799 --> 01:53:42.267
LIAM: But, you know, I think you and I should
sleep down here tonight, actually.

01:53:42.267 --> 01:53:43.827
SAM: With the skelly?

01:53:43.827 --> 01:53:44.793
LIAM: Yes.

01:53:44.953 --> 01:53:47.174
(laughter)

01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:51.756
TALIESIN: I think we're going to need you upstairs
for some identification. I think it would be less

01:53:51.756 --> 01:53:53.529
suspicious sleeping down here.

01:53:53.529 --> 01:54:01.367
LIAM: I worry-- well, I'll tell you my concerns
and that is that this thing is beyond

01:54:01.367 --> 01:54:05.954
comprehension, even. And the desire to get it back
is going to be great. This-- and I pull out the

01:54:05.954 --> 01:54:10.889
Sending Stone-- is just a stone that I stole from
Sutan's house. This I'm not worried about. Would

01:54:10.889 --> 01:54:12.979
you put this in your backpack, please?

01:54:12.998 --> 01:54:15.730
LAURA: I'm not with you. I'm upstairs trying to
get a hold of Claudia.

01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:17.850
LIAM: Oh, you’re not with us? I'll have to ask
Jester to put this in her backpack.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:18.951
TALIESIN: So noted.

01:54:19.358 --> 01:54:24.667
LIAM: But this thing was worth blowing up a tower
for.

01:54:24.667 --> 01:54:28.109
TALIESIN: And if someone spies on it, I don't want
them to see you with it.

01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:30.426
SAM: If we slept in our rooms--

01:54:30.426 --> 01:54:36.863
LIAM: You cannot spy on a thing, as far as I know.
You can spy on a place. You can spy on a person.

01:54:36.863 --> 01:54:42.255
TALIESIN: You can spy on anything, I imagine. I
mean, it's magic, right?

01:54:42.255 --> 01:54:44.704
LIAM: This is why I want the lead box.

01:54:44.704 --> 01:54:48.239
TALIESIN: Is that really going to work?

01:54:48.239 --> 01:54:57.167
SAM: But what if someone breaks in and we're here?
Then we're attached to these objects. I mean, I'll

01:54:57.167 --> 01:55:02.622
sleep down here if you want. Maybe we can get rid
of the skelly first.

01:55:02.622 --> 01:55:06.731
TALIESIN: It’ll take 20 seconds to get here from
the second that alarm goes off.

01:55:06.731 --> 01:55:07.989
LIAM: All right.

01:55:10.379 --> 01:55:11.864
TALIESIN: One night.

01:55:13.718 --> 01:55:15.630
LIAM: Okay. Well, let’s hide it.

01:55:15.736 --> 01:55:17.180
TALIESIN: Well.

01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:23.077
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. From normal people. I put the same
shitty rag on it that was on it before.

01:55:23.084 --> 01:55:29.589
MATT: Okay. Make a general survival check to pull
things from the surrounding--

01:55:30.891 --> 01:55:33.847
LIAM: Two plus three. That’s five.

01:55:34.284 --> 01:55:35.661
TALIESIN: Can I help with this?

01:55:35.661 --> 01:55:37.729
MATT: Sure. You look at it, the job he did, and
you’re like, "Yeah, I can probably do a little better."

01:55:39.389 --> 01:55:43.343
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can! Is this survival? Seven.

01:55:43.343 --> 01:55:45.876
MARISHA: Always have someone check your work.

01:55:45.876 --> 01:55:49.125
LIAM: Molly and Caleb put the skull on top of it
together.

01:55:50.216 --> 01:55:55.723
MATT: It’s fine. Essentially, you didn’t do a
masterful job in completely camouflaging it, but

01:55:55.723 --> 01:55:59.294
it looks like it’s the rest of the objects that
looks dusty and left there.

01:55:59.294 --> 01:56:02.097
LIAM: Did you say there were crates down here
too?

01:56:02.097 --> 01:56:07.417
MATT: There were some barrels. There was an open
crate with nothing in it. It’s a dusty, unused cellar.

01:56:08.062 --> 01:56:11.431
TALIESIN: Let’s put it behind the skeleton. If I
came down here, I’d look in the crates. It’s the

01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:12.666
first thing I’d do.

01:56:12.666 --> 01:56:13.850
LIAM: Okay.

01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:15.812
LAURA: You would-- Oh. Never mind, I’m not there.

01:56:15.812 --> 01:56:18.236
MATT: So you hide it up and put it off to the
side.

01:56:18.236 --> 01:56:19.916
TALIESIN: I look in the crate.

01:56:19.916 --> 01:56:28.871
MATT: You look in the crate? You look inside and
see a fairly rat-eaten sack of rice grains that

01:56:28.871 --> 01:56:30.322
have spilled out.

01:56:30.322 --> 01:56:31.696
TALIESIN: Awesome.

01:56:31.696 --> 01:56:34.785
MATT: As well as a lot of rat droppings in the
crate. It looks like some of the wood at the

01:56:34.785 --> 01:56:36.717
bottom has been chewed through as well.

01:56:36.717 --> 01:56:38.121
LAURA: I’m not there.

01:56:38.121 --> 01:56:41.775
TALIESIN: Nope. Never mind. Damn. That was good
thought, though.

01:56:41.775 --> 01:56:43.517
LAURA: That was a really good thought.

01:56:43.517 --> 01:56:45.035
MATT: Anything else, guys?

01:56:45.035 --> 01:56:46.726
TALIESIN: Thread. Lock.

01:56:46.726 --> 01:56:48.804
SAM: What’s wrong, Caleb?

01:56:48.804 --> 01:56:51.588
LIAM: I really think we should stay down here with
it.

01:56:51.588 --> 01:56:53.658
SAM: All right. I’m game.

01:56:53.658 --> 01:56:57.403
TALIESIN: One of you, if not both of you.

01:56:58.943 --> 01:57:04.523
LIAM: Why don’t you and I stay down here for the
night? You have anything you want me to identify,

01:57:04.690 --> 01:57:08.438
leave it, I can do that. You know what I have, I’m
not leaving.

01:57:08.438 --> 01:57:14.242
SAM: What? I mean, we don’t know what Fjord and
the grumpy one have discovered. Maybe we should go

01:57:14.242 --> 01:57:19.024
upstairs and reconnoiter with them and then come
down here, when it’s time for beddy-bye.

01:57:19.024 --> 01:57:24.583
LIAM: I will stay with this thing. You go up. When
they come back, you come back down. My gut tells

01:57:24.583 --> 01:57:27.907
me to stay close to this thing.

01:57:30.737 --> 01:57:33.325
SAM: All right. I’ll stay with you, then.

01:57:33.479 --> 01:57:35.072
LIAM: I’m glad.

01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:38.086
MATT: All right.

01:57:38.086 --> 01:57:40.784
TALIESIN: So we’re going to go in and out of this
room several times tonight?

01:57:40.784 --> 01:57:42.663
LIAM: The entrance to this is in the back of the
building, right?

01:57:42.663 --> 01:57:44.607
MATT: It is, yes. It’s in the alley.

01:57:44.607 --> 01:57:47.083
TALIESIN: That in no way is suspicious, but that’s
fine.

01:57:47.083 --> 01:57:50.394
LIAM: Well, Nott, you go up. You can just Message
me.

01:57:50.394 --> 01:57:54.246
SAM: Oh yes, I can do that. Should I do that and
then come back later?

01:57:54.246 --> 01:57:56.971
LIAM: Yeah, and you come down here.

01:57:56.971 --> 01:58:04.522
SAM: You’re just going to stay here in this dank,
dark room with a skeleton by yourself, no dinner.

01:58:05.855 --> 01:58:06.842
All right.

01:58:06.842 --> 01:58:09.171
MARISHA: Sounds like half the clubs in LA.

01:58:09.171 --> 01:58:11.933
SAM: All right. I’ll be back in less than an hour.

01:58:12.016 --> 01:58:13.887
TRAVIS: We got a quesadilla.

01:58:13.887 --> 01:58:15.221
MARISHA: Fuck!

01:58:15.221 --> 01:58:18.115
All right. I’ll go up and see what they are saying.

01:58:18.115 --> 01:58:19.988
MATT: While this is happening--

01:58:19.988 --> 01:58:27.230
LIAM: When they leave, I’m going to take the big
item and put it on my person. I’m going to hold

01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:28.683
it, actually.

01:58:28.683 --> 01:58:33.530
MATT: Okay. As you’re holding it there, it’s
strangely warm to the touch. The more time you

01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:36.493
spend with it holding it there.

01:58:36.611 --> 01:58:41.982
LIAM: I am not, like, looking into the abyss. I
just don’t understand it and I’m just holding it there.

01:58:41.982 --> 01:58:43.138
MATT: Yeah.

01:58:43.138 --> 01:58:44.261
LIAM: Okay.

01:58:44.261 --> 01:58:47.273
MATT: Okay. Let me see here. Okay.

01:58:47.539 --> 01:58:49.274
LIAM: Jester had all the shit, right?

01:58:49.274 --> 01:58:50.749
LAURA: I had all the shit!

01:58:50.749 --> 01:58:58.713
MATT: Yep. So you head back up into the Leaky Tap
Tavern. There’s a handful of patrons, a lot of

01:58:58.713 --> 01:59:03.931
them are talking or whispering about the events
tonight. Talking about, "The tower’s still up

01:59:03.931 --> 01:59:08.020
"there! It’s crazy!" The general
conversation-hubbub through the room.

01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:11.591
LAURA: I go to the barkeep. Is Claudia awake?

01:59:11.591 --> 01:59:16.656
MATT: "Probably in her office."

01:59:16.656 --> 01:59:18.467
LAURA: Okay! I go and knock on the door.

01:59:18.573 --> 01:59:22.157
MATT: Okay. "Who is it?"

01:59:22.157 --> 01:59:23.925
LAURA: It’s me, Jester!

01:59:25.595 --> 01:59:27.814
MATT: "Um, w-what do you want?"

01:59:27.888 --> 01:59:33.472
LAURA: Claudia! When we were over at the Gala, we
saw things that were going on, it was crazy, a

01:59:33.581 --> 01:59:38.736
tower exploded and then all hell broke loose. Did
you know someone tried to steal my stuff?

01:59:40.144 --> 01:59:43.806
MATT: "I did not know that. My apologies."

01:59:43.806 --> 01:59:49.241
LAURA: Do you have maybe a safe or something?
Because I don’t feel safe carrying around my

01:59:49.241 --> 01:59:51.739
jewelry anymore with me.

01:59:51.739 --> 01:59:55.593
MATT: "No, not on me. Well--

01:59:58.253 --> 02:00:01.253
"Come back in the morning, 
I might have something for you."

02:00:01.253 --> 02:00:04.071
LAURA: Claudia, are you naked? Why won't you open
this door?

02:00:04.208 --> 02:00:05.171
SAM: Flush.

02:00:05.171 --> 02:00:07.056
MATT: "No, I am busy at the moment."

02:00:07.056 --> 02:00:08.215
LAURA: Is everything okay?

02:00:08.215 --> 02:00:10.069
MATT: "Everything is just fine."

02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:19.646
LAURA: Claudia. Blink once-- knock-- say you're
not okay if you're not okay because you sound weird.

02:00:20.787 --> 02:00:23.604
MATT: "I'm fine. Do not worry."

02:00:25.136 --> 02:00:30.638
LAURA: Okay. But you do have a safe I can put my
jewelry in now?

02:00:30.638 --> 02:00:34.750
MATT: "It is currently in use, but I can swap it
out. How long do you need it for?"

02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:39.729
LAURA: Well, I was going to put it in my room for
as long as we're here, if that's okay with you.

02:00:39.729 --> 02:00:43.709
MATT: "Okay, then come back in the morning. I will
have it cleared out."

02:00:43.709 --> 02:00:44.848
LAURA: Okay.

02:00:44.848 --> 02:00:46.550
MATT: "Then it will be at use for you."

02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:49.051
LAURA: Are you having sex?

02:00:50.321 --> 02:00:51.650
MATT: "No."

02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:55.378
LAURA: Do you want me to come in? Are you okay?

02:00:55.452 --> 02:00:56.457
MATT: "I'm okay."

02:00:56.457 --> 02:01:00.237
LAURA: You sound really weird. I try the
doorknob.

02:01:00.237 --> 02:01:02.852
MATT: Okay. It's locked.

02:01:04.597 --> 02:01:08.462
LIAM: Cue the horror strings. (violin
screeching)

02:01:09.490 --> 02:01:12.020
TALIESIN: I have had this roommate.

02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:14.620
MARISHA: I was just about to say, Jester’s
everyone's little sister when you're a senior in

02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:15.479
high school.

02:01:15.479 --> 02:01:18.595
LIAM: Jester's face pushes through the door!

02:01:18.595 --> 02:01:21.502
LAURA: I get down on my hands and knees and try to
look. Can I look under the door?

02:01:21.502 --> 02:01:26.300
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage
because you are looking through a tiny little gap

02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:28.066
in the floor.

02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:31.588
TALIESIN: Whoa.

02:01:31.588 --> 02:01:33.949
LAURA: Okay, well the first one was really good.

02:01:34.383 --> 02:01:38.573
Perception. Nine.

02:01:38.573 --> 02:01:45.933
MATT: Nine? You see there's light in there and you
can see Claudia darting back and forth behind her

02:01:45.933 --> 02:01:53.665
desk, moving very rapidly and with haste. Is
grabbing things and seems to be writing something

02:01:53.665 --> 02:01:58.149
feverishly. But you don't actually see her, you
just see the bottom of her feet moving back and forth.

02:01:58.273 --> 02:02:00.403
MARISHA: Why are so many fucking people trying to
skip town?

02:02:00.403 --> 02:02:01.691
TRAVIS: Shady motherfuckers.

02:02:01.691 --> 02:02:03.563
LAURA: Claudia, what are you doing?

02:02:03.563 --> 02:02:07.610
MATT: She stops in the space. "Um, I'm--"

02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:10.267
LAURA: Is everything okay?

02:02:10.728 --> 02:02:12.512
MATT: "Everything's fine."

02:02:12.512 --> 02:02:14.457
LAURA: Did you see the tower explode?

02:02:14.457 --> 02:02:15.838
MATT: "I heard about it."

02:02:15.838 --> 02:02:17.772
LAURA: Can you let me in?

02:02:18.462 --> 02:02:20.494
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:02:21.282 --> 02:02:22.503
TRAVIS: That cuteness, man.

02:02:22.503 --> 02:02:24.464
TALIESIN: There should be an annoyance check. This
is so great.

02:02:24.898 --> 02:02:26.846
LIAM: Give her advantage. Oh my god.

02:02:27.225 --> 02:02:28.278
LAURA: 15.

02:02:28.278 --> 02:02:35.651
MATT: 15. The door opens up and you can see
Claudia looking as pristine as ever. Hair, makeup,

02:02:35.651 --> 02:02:38.543
everything done perfectly. "Come in, quickly."

02:02:38.543 --> 02:02:39.725
LAURA: Okay.

02:02:39.725 --> 02:02:41.610
MATT: Closes the door, brings you inside.

02:02:41.610 --> 02:02:42.994
LIAM: Can I come in now?

02:02:42.994 --> 02:02:45.242
MARISHA: Don't take no for an answer.

02:02:45.242 --> 02:02:47.280
LIAM: How about now?

02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:55.788
MATT: "I am aware that you and your team were
involved in something this evening. Am I correct?"

02:02:55.940 --> 02:03:02.603
LAURA: Well, we were at the Gala because we were
having some fun.

02:03:03.042 --> 02:03:09.251
MATT: "But you are not in any way, shape or form
perhaps doing a burglary and job breaking in for

02:03:09.251 --> 02:03:11.115
"the Knights of Requital, yes?"

02:03:11.115 --> 02:03:13.283
LAURA: Who are that?

02:03:15.178 --> 02:03:17.243
SAM: Two floors below we're putting a skull--

02:03:17.243 --> 02:03:24.173
(laughter)

02:03:24.183 --> 02:03:26.752
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:03:26.752 --> 02:03:28.354
TRAVIS: Who are that?

02:03:28.354 --> 02:03:33.974
LAURA: That's actually a really good deception.
21.

02:03:33.974 --> 02:03:44.113
MATT: She looks at you confused and goes, "Well,
regardless, your friends are involved in something

02:03:44.113 --> 02:03:55.129
"that as a precaution, as I have been housing
certain meetings out of friendship with an

02:03:55.129 --> 02:04:04.703
"individual, there is danger that I might be pulled
up in this. So I am preparing to sell off the tavern."

02:04:06.193 --> 02:04:12.289
LAURA: (gasps) Wait a minute, but wouldn't that
draw attention to the tavern?

02:04:13.439 --> 02:04:15.763
MATT: "It will only draw attention to me."

02:04:17.463 --> 02:04:18.441
LAURA: Okay.

02:04:18.441 --> 02:04:21.470
MATT: She walks over and finishes tidying
paperwork on the side.

02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:23.161
LAURA: Who are you selling it to?

02:04:26.511 --> 02:04:30.638
MATT: Make a general charisma roll. Just for the
hell of it.

02:04:30.638 --> 02:04:35.044
LAURA: Well see, this is why I-- oh no. Ten?

02:04:35.044 --> 02:04:38.639
MATT: Ten? She goes, "To a friend."

02:04:38.639 --> 02:04:44.437
LAURA: Oh. Friends are good. Can I have that safe
though?

02:04:44.437 --> 02:04:54.273
MATT: (sighs) She kneels down at the side of the
room and there's a cloth put over a small table,

02:04:54.273 --> 02:04:58.525
like an end table, and she removes the flowers
from it, pulls the cloth off and it's a safe.

02:04:59.105 --> 02:05:00.804
LAURA: What's it made out of?

02:05:01.704 --> 02:05:04.866
MATT: "Out of iron. What else would you make a
safe out of?"

02:05:04.866 --> 02:05:06.092
LAURA: Oh. Okay.

02:05:07.522 --> 02:05:14.688
MATT: She pulls out a key and unlocks it, brings
out a couple of bags of coin, brings out a couple

02:05:14.688 --> 02:05:19.683
other bags of something. You don't hear any noise,
the rustling as she pulls it out. Sets them off to

02:05:19.683 --> 02:05:21.350
the side, looks at you while she does so the whole
time like--

02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:23.736
LAURA: Are those drugs?

02:05:26.476 --> 02:05:27.586
MATT: "Here’s your safe."

02:05:27.586 --> 02:05:28.350
LAURA: Thank you.

02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:35.025
MATT: Hands it to you. It's small. It's heavy, but
you're pretty strong. "All right."

02:05:35.025 --> 02:05:38.933
LAURA: Well, all right. Will you be gone in the
morning, then?

02:05:38.933 --> 02:05:39.603
MATT: "Probably."

02:05:39.603 --> 02:05:42.364
LAURA: Oh no! But Claudia, I really like you.

02:05:42.364 --> 02:05:47.530
MATT: "Well, I like you too. But that's okay.
Don't worry. The woman I'm selling this to is also

02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:50.426
"a very good person and a good friend."

02:05:51.266 --> 02:05:52.209
LAURA: What's her name?

02:05:53.509 --> 02:05:57.642
MATT: There's a brief pause, glances over at the
paperwork on the table--

02:05:57.642 --> 02:05:59.212
LAURA: I look down at the paperwork on the table,
too.

02:06:00.222 --> 02:06:03.485
MATT: "Lauren. Lauren Schvine."

02:06:03.485 --> 02:06:05.701
LAURA: Is that what it says?

02:06:05.701 --> 02:06:06.254
MATT: It is.

02:06:06.254 --> 02:06:17.262
LAURA: (giggles) Okay. Lauren. That's a good name.
I heard when we were coming back that they were

02:06:17.262 --> 02:06:22.817
putting the city on lockdown, so if you're going
to leave, you should probably do it quickly.

02:06:23.267 --> 02:06:26.297
MATT: "I appreciate the information. I should be
okay."

02:06:26.297 --> 02:06:27.370
LAURA: All right.

02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:30.039
MATT: "Good night."

02:06:30.039 --> 02:06:33.255
LAURA: Good night. Thank you, Claudia, for all of
this.

02:06:33.255 --> 02:06:34.284
MATT: "Not a problem."

02:06:36.484 --> 02:06:40.993
LAURA: I walk very slowly out of the room and keep
looking over my shoulder as I'm doing it and

02:06:40.993 --> 02:06:41.860
smiling back at her.

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:45.425
MATT: She watches and waits, sees you smiling,
arms crossed on the desk, patiently waiting.

02:06:45.425 --> 02:06:49.961
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to put this in my room,
thank you.

02:06:50.711 --> 02:06:56.770
MATT: The door closes behind you and you hear a
(heavy sigh) audibly on the other side of the

02:06:56.770 --> 02:07:02.768
door. So as the rest of you begin to catch up and
gather for the evening, we're going to take a break!

02:07:02.777 --> 02:07:04.757
(cheering)

02:07:04.757 --> 02:07:08.088
MATT: Be back here in a few minutes to pick up
from that point. We do have tonight's Wyrmwood

02:07:08.088 --> 02:07:12.835
giveaway. That went all sorts of weird,
interesting ways. Oh man.

02:07:12.835 --> 02:07:16.378
MARISHA: We almost killed a guy and then someone
else killed a guy, we <i>still</i> reaped all the

02:07:16.378 --> 02:07:19.364
rewards. Good for us, guys. Good for us.

02:07:19.364 --> 02:07:21.032
MATT: Not all of them.

02:07:21.032 --> 02:07:22.134
LAURA: Oh no.

02:07:22.134 --> 02:07:26.523
MATT: There’s a lot of interesting ways that could
have gone. All right, so we have the black walnut

02:07:26.523 --> 02:07:31.079
deck box from our friends at Wyrmwood here. Also,
apparently comes with a Magic the Gathering pack.

02:07:31.079 --> 02:07:35.762
These have been in all the boxes so you get a
little gift in there. This will go out to one

02:07:35.762 --> 02:07:41.062
winner. You have to enter Twitch chat, starting
now. You can only put the word in once, or you'll

02:07:41.062 --> 02:07:46.858
be disqualified, but the word tonight is
"Threats." T-H-R-E-A-T-S. Come into the Twitch

02:07:46.858 --> 02:07:51.502
chat, enter that. Once again, only, unfortunately,
available to people in the United States and

02:07:51.502 --> 02:07:56.519
Canada, excluding Quebec. We're trying to figure
out how to fix that in the future, but weird laws

02:07:56.519 --> 02:08:02.739
in giveaways. Anyway, we'll be back here in a few
minutes. Much love and we'll see you soon.

02:08:02.739 --> 02:21:45.156
[break]

02:21:45.156 --> 02:21:49.326
MATT: And welcome back. Way late on that one.

02:21:50.216 --> 02:21:51.470
LIAM: It was like a Pokémon, though.

02:21:51.470 --> 02:21:57.821
MATT: There you go. We have a winner. The winner
for this evening is Iraginger. Iraginger, congratulations.

02:21:57.821 --> 02:21:59.432
MARISHA: Ey, represent!

02:21:59.432 --> 02:22:06.462
MATT: We'll get that box to you ASAP. Well done.
All right, so, bringing us back into the game, you

02:22:06.462 --> 02:22:13.434
all begin to converge back in the Leaky Tap. The
party has reassembled, aside from you, who are

02:22:13.434 --> 02:22:14.560
staying down in the basement.

02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:15.845
LIAM: Hanging out with my new friend.

02:22:15.845 --> 02:22:16.443
MATT: Yes.

02:22:16.683 --> 02:22:17.654
SAM: Yorick.

02:22:18.454 --> 02:22:20.905
MATT: As you guys all gather together, what do you
do?

02:22:21.505 --> 02:22:24.702
LAURA: Are we in a room? We should be in a room
instead of in the--

02:22:24.702 --> 02:22:25.564
TRAVIS: Not downstairs?

02:22:25.564 --> 02:22:26.176
LAURA: Yeah.

02:22:26.176 --> 02:22:28.545
MARISHA: Upstairs, yeah. Convene in-room.

02:22:28.545 --> 02:22:30.574
TALIESIN: There's money and loot. Let's take a
look.

02:22:31.724 --> 02:22:33.992
TRAVIS: Convene in the girls' room. It's bound to
be cleaner.

02:22:33.992 --> 02:22:35.368
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:22:35.574 --> 02:22:36.785
MARISHA: It's all right.

02:22:36.785 --> 02:22:38.220
LAURA: We did have a pillow fight.

02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:41.133
MARISHA: Yeah, it's down feathers all over the
place.

02:22:41.133 --> 02:22:41.880
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty (blows out lips).

02:22:44.470 --> 02:22:47.617
SAM: So we've got some stuff. What did we get?

02:22:47.617 --> 02:22:49.981
LAURA: (heavy thud) Nott, what is this made out
of?

02:22:51.511 --> 02:22:55.813
SAM: This? I will taste it. I will lick the safe.

02:22:57.773 --> 02:23:06.161
MATT: It's very... iron-y? It's like licking a nine
volt battery.

02:23:07.231 --> 02:23:08.189
LAURA: Is it made of lead?

02:23:08.189 --> 02:23:12.368
SAM: It's ironic. It's not what we want.

02:23:16.508 --> 02:23:18.536
LAURA: I really was trying to get a lead box.

02:23:18.536 --> 02:23:25.977
SAM: You did very well considering it's after
midnight and you got a metal box for free.

02:23:26.437 --> 02:23:27.112
LAURA: It's true.

02:23:29.502 --> 02:23:32.368
SAM: I don't know, can I tell it's lead-- I mean,
iron, not lead?

02:23:33.498 --> 02:23:37.599
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Because you are
an alchemist, I'll give you advantage on it.

02:23:39.489 --> 02:23:41.837
SAM: Okay. Just a straight intelligence check?

02:23:41.837 --> 02:23:42.443
MATT: Yep.

02:23:42.443 --> 02:23:42.825
SAM: 15.

02:23:42.825 --> 02:23:49.425
MATT: 15? Okay, yeah. This is very definitively
iron. You've tasted iron, iron filings and things

02:23:49.425 --> 02:23:52.343
of that similar nature and it has the same twinge
to the flavor.

02:23:52.343 --> 02:23:55.913
SAM: Oh. It's a very well-made safe.

02:23:55.913 --> 02:23:58.701
LAURA: Well, we can still put stuff in it if we
want to.

02:23:59.261 --> 02:24:00.672
MARISHA: Where's Caleb? He downstairs?

02:24:00.672 --> 02:24:01.792
TRAVIS: Yeah, where is Caleb?

02:24:01.792 --> 02:24:07.226
SAM: He's downstairs for now, but I am in constant
communication with him.

02:24:07.226 --> 02:24:09.045
MARISHA: What's the last thing he said?

02:24:10.515 --> 02:24:17.373
SAM: I take out my piece of wire and I do my
incantation and I whisper to it and I say: Did the

02:24:17.373 --> 02:24:20.071
skeleton come to life and kill you? Please respond
to this message.

02:24:20.071 --> 02:24:21.877
LIAM: Everybody is dead down here.

02:24:23.507 --> 02:24:24.757
SAM: He's a prankster.

02:24:24.757 --> 02:24:26.788
(laughter)

02:24:26.788 --> 02:24:29.139
SAM: He's good ol' Cay.

02:24:31.229 --> 02:24:32.889
TRAVIS: He's down there babysitting our item?

02:24:32.889 --> 02:24:33.396
SAM: Yeah.

02:24:33.396 --> 02:24:34.209
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:24:36.269 --> 02:24:38.957
TALIESIN: We're going to want to take a look at
these boots. These daggers.

02:24:38.957 --> 02:24:46.442
LAURA: Hey, Claudia was aware that we guys were in
league with the Knights of Requital.

02:24:46.442 --> 02:24:47.149
MARISHA: Makes sense.

02:24:47.149 --> 02:24:49.653
LAURA: Claudia says she's selling the tavern.

02:24:49.653 --> 02:24:51.063
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and TRAVIS: What?!

02:24:51.063 --> 02:24:53.120
LAURA: Yeah. Like tonight.

02:24:55.470 --> 02:24:56.088
MARISHA: How much?

02:24:56.088 --> 02:25:01.124
LAURA: To a girl named Lauren Spizzick or
something.

02:25:01.124 --> 02:25:02.401
MARISHA: Shpizich?

02:25:02.401 --> 02:25:03.308
TRAVIS: Spinach.

02:25:06.508 --> 02:25:07.096
SAM: Lauren Spinach.

02:25:07.726 --> 02:25:11.806
LAURA: So she said she was selling it, and I said,
"Wouldn't that draw attention to the tavern,

02:25:11.806 --> 02:25:20.268
"though?" and she said no, just her. But if it
does, and she knows, then maybe it could lead the

02:25:20.268 --> 02:25:21.832
guards to us, though.

02:25:21.832 --> 02:25:24.037
SAM: Should we change to a different hotel?

02:25:24.037 --> 02:25:27.004
LAURA: It might be smart, but that might be--

02:25:27.004 --> 02:25:29.976
SAM: Wait, she was selling this place because of
<i>us</i>?

02:25:29.976 --> 02:25:32.359
MATT: As a note, so you guys recall, Horris is
with you.

02:25:33.259 --> 02:25:33.941
MARISHA: Wait, what?

02:25:34.741 --> 02:25:35.911
LAURA: Wait, Horris came with us?

02:25:35.911 --> 02:25:36.835
MATT: Horris came along with you guys.

02:25:36.835 --> 02:25:38.097
TRAVIS: That's my bad. Yeah, he did.

02:25:38.097 --> 02:25:40.256
MARISHA: I thought we just sent him on his way.

02:25:40.256 --> 02:25:42.164
TRAVIS: Yeah, we forgot to qualify that.

02:25:42.164 --> 02:25:43.617
MARISHA: Aw, fuck! I thought--

02:25:43.617 --> 02:25:45.356
LIAM: Make believe is tricky, guys.

02:25:45.356 --> 02:25:47.268
LAURA: Horris is in this room right now?

02:25:47.268 --> 02:25:48.500
MATT: Horris is in the room with you.

02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:50.231
LAURA: Aw, come on, man.

02:25:50.231 --> 02:25:52.312
SAM: I should put on my pants.

02:25:52.722 --> 02:25:54.214
TALIESIN: Let's not be hasty.

02:25:54.214 --> 02:25:57.669
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, the
door now opens to the room and Horris comes in

02:25:57.669 --> 02:26:01.927
after a drink to steady his nerves and goes,
"Hello."

02:26:02.747 --> 02:26:07.441
MARISHA: Did you bring me that drink? Oh, sit
down.

02:26:07.441 --> 02:26:10.991
TRAVIS: Yeah, jeez, man. No sense of humor right
now, he's in shock, all right?

02:26:10.991 --> 02:26:11.438
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:26:12.488 --> 02:26:16.211
TRAVIS: Horris, we're going to get you out of the
city as soon as possible. Is there a destination

02:26:16.211 --> 02:26:18.882
you wanted to send him to, or point him in the
right direction?

02:26:18.882 --> 02:26:22.562
MARISHA: I was mentioning Alfield, but really,
it's up to him, I guess. I don't care.

02:26:22.562 --> 02:26:25.117
TRAVIS: Have any spots in mind that you can lay
low for a while?

02:26:25.117 --> 02:26:26.519
SAM: Why does he need to leave the city?

02:26:28.489 --> 02:26:30.994
MARISHA: We walked in on him and his boy trying to
skip town.

02:26:33.504 --> 02:26:39.428
TRAVIS: They were understandably rattled. It's
understandable, but Dolan's going to try and stay

02:26:39.428 --> 02:26:44.269
to make the city a better place. Horris is going
to remove a bit of the risk for himself for a bit.

02:26:44.689 --> 02:26:45.519
MATT: "Just for a little bit."

02:26:47.729 --> 02:26:51.715
LAURA: You should go to the coast. You should get
out of the empire.

02:26:51.715 --> 02:26:53.909
TRAVIS: It is lovely by the coast.

02:26:53.909 --> 02:26:57.400
MARISHA: Well, he said he only wanted to be gone a
week, though, right?

02:26:57.400 --> 02:26:59.574
MATT: "About a week or two, until things--"

02:27:00.754 --> 02:27:04.224
SAM: Why do you need to leave? Who's suspicious of
you?

02:27:04.224 --> 02:27:07.629
MATT: "We don't know yet. It's just a
precautionary measure."

02:27:07.629 --> 02:27:14.501
MARISHA: You do know that leaving town itself is
suspicious in its own right, right? Just throwing

02:27:14.501 --> 02:27:15.240
it out there.

02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:20.853
MATT: "We have an alibi, but if we both stay and
we get found out, we both get arrested."

02:27:20.853 --> 02:27:26.174
MARISHA: But you have an alibi. It's hard to have
an alibi when you mysteriously--

02:27:26.174 --> 02:27:27.320
MATT: "What do you want me to do, then?"

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:28.764
MARISHA: I don't give a shit what you--

02:27:28.764 --> 02:27:31.454
MATT: "She who questions everything and offers no
answers. What do you want me to do?"

02:27:33.494 --> 02:27:39.763
TRAVIS: I think what Beau is trying to say is that
you've made a wise choice in removing yourself for

02:27:39.763 --> 02:27:44.181
a bit. Did you happen to know the owner of The
Leaky Tap? She's apparently selling it.

02:27:44.181 --> 02:27:48.512
MARISHA: Yeah. Claudia. Also skipping town.

02:27:48.512 --> 02:27:50.846
MATT: "I don't blame her, either."

02:27:50.846 --> 02:27:54.162
LAURA: I don't know if she's leaving town. She's
just selling the tavern.

02:27:54.162 --> 02:27:55.168
TRAVIS: She's selling it? Yeah.

02:27:55.168 --> 02:28:00.439
MARISHA: She knew we were holding all those
backroom meetings, right? She helps you guys quite

02:28:00.439 --> 02:28:00.817
a lot.

02:28:00.817 --> 02:28:02.996
MATT: "As far as Dolan told me, yeah."

02:28:02.996 --> 02:28:07.285
TRAVIS: Did you want to get out of town tonight,
or did you want to wait until the morning, perhaps?

02:28:07.285 --> 02:28:10.408
MATT: "I can wait until the morning, if you don't
mind me crashing with you."

02:28:10.408 --> 02:28:12.415
TRAVIS: Not at all. We have room in Molly and I's
room.

02:28:13.465 --> 02:28:15.481
SAM: You can take Caleb and my room.

02:28:17.491 --> 02:28:19.670
LAURA: Why? Are you not going to--

02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:21.975
SAM: We'll be spending the night somewhere else.

02:28:21.975 --> 02:28:23.675
LAURA: (gasps) Where?

02:28:23.675 --> 02:28:30.093
TALIESIN: Well, we're not going to speak of that
in mixed company, but they're dealing with other problems.

02:28:32.513 --> 02:28:36.110
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll lead Horris to our room and let
him get comfortable. I'll be back.

02:28:39.100 --> 02:28:44.505
LIAM: Just a quick aside, while all of this is
going on. I place the thing in my lap and I pick

02:28:44.505 --> 02:28:51.435
up the skull. Oh, so many secrets, huh, Yorick?

02:28:53.685 --> 02:29:01.034
(gravelly) "Maybe you should tear it off your chest." 
I don't think that's a good idea.

02:29:02.504 --> 02:29:10.616
"It's driving you crazy." 
Maybe not yet.

02:29:12.196 --> 02:29:18.506
"It's probably a good idea." 
You're funny.

02:29:20.516 --> 02:29:21.552
TRAVIS: (gravelly) Red rum.

02:29:22.662 --> 02:29:24.052
MATT: Seriously.

02:29:26.252 --> 02:29:27.556
SAM: I get to spend the night with that guy.

02:29:27.556 --> 02:29:29.103
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're going down there.

02:29:29.103 --> 02:29:32.496
MATT: All right. Anything else you want to work
out, discuss, or plan?

02:29:32.496 --> 02:29:39.271
TALIESIN: Let's divvy up the loot. I've worked it
out, that's 19 platinum apiece, and two gold

02:29:39.271 --> 02:29:40.609
pieces apiece.

02:29:40.609 --> 02:29:42.757
TRAVIS: Wow, fucking pay day!

02:29:42.757 --> 02:29:44.920
TALIESIN: With two platinum left over.

02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:46.832
MARISHA: How many platinum? 19?

02:29:46.832 --> 02:29:47.480
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:50.264
LAURA: That's a lot of platinum.

02:29:50.264 --> 02:29:50.989
MARISHA: And two gold?

02:29:50.989 --> 02:29:51.833
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:29:51.833 --> 02:29:53.924
SAM: I'll take Caleb's share and give it to him.

02:29:53.924 --> 02:29:54.724
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:29:56.524 --> 02:30:03.324
LAURA: Okay, so we also got-- let's look. This
sword.

02:30:05.474 --> 02:30:07.097
TRAVIS: What kind of sword is it?

02:30:08.527 --> 02:30:17.592
MATT: It's roughly longsword length. It has this
curved, hooked edge to it. The blade looks like it

02:30:17.592 --> 02:30:22.012
would not just slash, but tear as it went through
flesh as well. It's pretty wicked-looking.

02:30:23.242 --> 02:30:24.600
LAURA: It's pretty wicked-looking.

02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:30.466
TRAVIS: Does it look like it has any magical aura
emanating from it?

02:30:30.466 --> 02:30:32.651
MATT: I don't know, can you sense magic?

02:30:33.721 --> 02:30:34.804
TRAVIS: Not officially.

02:30:36.464 --> 02:30:37.882
MATT: Then you do not know.

02:30:37.882 --> 02:30:43.318
SAM: I can take it downstairs later and have
Cay-Cay take a look at it.

02:30:44.468 --> 02:30:46.244
TRAVIS: Cay-Cay, not to be confused with Kiki.

02:30:46.244 --> 02:30:46.800
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:51.758
LAURA: We also have these really super cool spiky
boots.

02:30:54.268 --> 02:30:55.182
TRAVIS: What do those do?

02:30:56.242 --> 02:30:58.725
LAURA: I think you put them on your feet and they
protect them.

02:30:58.725 --> 02:31:00.415
TRAVIS: Molly, put those boots on.

02:31:00.415 --> 02:31:05.394
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right. How do they look?

02:31:05.394 --> 02:31:06.807
MATT: They look nice.

02:31:06.807 --> 02:31:08.737
TALIESIN: I think they clash a bit, but--

02:31:08.737 --> 02:31:10.323
LAURA: I don't think they go with your pants.

02:31:10.323 --> 02:31:10.934
TALIESIN: No, not really.

02:31:10.934 --> 02:31:12.632
TRAVIS: You get an extra spring in your step?
What's it do?

02:31:16.502 --> 02:31:21.610
MATT: You take a moment and you feel... alert.

02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:25.587
TALIESIN: They're caffeinated. Sorry.

02:31:26.497 --> 02:31:28.504
MARISHA: I didn't expect you to wear platforms.

02:31:32.274 --> 02:31:35.637
LAURA: It's weird to see the bottom of your pants
because you normally have those thigh-highs on.

02:31:35.637 --> 02:31:38.538
TALIESIN: Oh, they're very comfortable and they
keep everything else clean.

02:31:38.538 --> 02:31:45.413
LAURA: Yes. Okay, we also have these three
daggers, which look like-- Are they ceremonial? Do

02:31:45.413 --> 02:31:45.783
they look--

02:31:45.783 --> 02:31:53.012
MATT: They look functional. They're similar in
design to the longsword. They're not quite as

02:31:53.012 --> 02:31:57.530
intricate, and they're much simpler. They don't
have the same grooves carved into the hilt, and

02:31:57.530 --> 02:32:03.625
they look like fairly decent daggers for either
stabbing or throwing.

02:32:03.625 --> 02:32:09.330
LAURA: I lick one, then I lick the safe. Is it
iron, then?

02:32:09.330 --> 02:32:14.507
MATT: You're not certain what material they're
made from. It's not the same as the-- What are you doing?

02:32:14.507 --> 02:32:15.756
TALIESIN: I'm playing with the longsword.

02:32:16.276 --> 02:32:17.786
MATT: It's got a great balance.

02:32:18.726 --> 02:32:21.523
LAURA: Oh, and we don't have the armor anymore, we
gave it back to him.

02:32:21.523 --> 02:32:25.602
MATT: Yeah, the armor you gave back, and then was
scooped up by the Crownsguard.

02:32:25.602 --> 02:32:33.763
MARISHA: I look at Molly and I take out my bo
staff. I say: Parry! and I go whack with the

02:32:33.763 --> 02:32:36.787
sword. See if anything happens.

02:32:36.787 --> 02:32:39.019
MATT: Okay. Do you attack him?

02:32:39.019 --> 02:32:39.630
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:40.721
MATT: Roll for an attack.

02:32:41.471 --> 02:32:43.248
MARISHA: I mean, I told him I was attacking.

02:32:43.248 --> 02:32:44.365
TALIESIN: I'm going to parry.

02:32:47.485 --> 02:32:48.370
MARISHA: 20 total.

02:32:48.930 --> 02:32:49.873
TALIESIN: Boy, that hits!

02:32:49.873 --> 02:32:54.403
MATT: You attempt to parry cooly, and she hits you
in the right eye.

02:32:56.253 --> 02:32:56.935
TALIESIN: Ow!

02:32:56.935 --> 02:33:00.393
MARISHA: Oh sorry, I thought we were just
wrestling a little.

02:33:00.393 --> 02:33:01.974
TALIESIN: I hit her with the flat of the blade.

02:33:01.974 --> 02:33:03.653
MARISHA: Ow! Fuck!

02:33:05.713 --> 02:33:06.527
TALIESIN: Any effect?

02:33:06.527 --> 02:33:08.055
MARISHA: Do I feel anything?

02:33:09.195 --> 02:33:09.846
MATT: Pain.

02:33:11.466 --> 02:33:12.923
SAM: Why don't I just have Caleb look--

02:33:12.923 --> 02:33:13.798
TALIESIN: Any effect?

02:33:13.798 --> 02:33:15.073
MARISHA: Yeah, a fucking headache!

02:33:15.073 --> 02:33:18.741
TALIESIN: My god, it works! It's amazing!

02:33:22.751 --> 02:33:28.007
SAM: I'll take the daggers, unless you can use
them to throw, I can throw them at things, I think?

02:33:28.467 --> 02:33:30.069
MARISHA: Do the daggers seem special?

02:33:30.069 --> 02:33:35.282
MATT: The daggers seem to be simpler in design.
You're not sure if they're special or not. I mean,

02:33:35.282 --> 02:33:39.004
the only person who can detect magic is not in the
room.

02:33:40.244 --> 02:33:42.382
LIAM: We're going to drag this out as long as
possible.

02:33:42.382 --> 02:33:42.982
MATT: I know!

02:33:42.982 --> 02:33:47.052
MARISHA: I'm going to take one of the daggers and
I throw it against the windowsill.

02:33:47.052 --> 02:33:48.965
TRAVIS: Window-seal?

02:33:48.965 --> 02:33:50.608
SAM: That's how they say it in Kentucky.

02:33:50.608 --> 02:33:52.219
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

02:33:52.219 --> 02:33:54.216
TRAVIS: Window-seal.

02:33:54.216 --> 02:33:58.402
MARISHA: Seal. Damn it, that's true. What did you
say?

02:33:58.402 --> 02:33:59.902
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

02:33:59.902 --> 02:34:06.102
MARISHA: (singing) Don't fuck me, Gil. 20. Sorry,
22.

02:34:06.102 --> 02:34:10.673
MATT: 22? Yeah. (vibrating impact) It sticks to
the bottom of the sill; it doesn't quite hit the

02:34:10.673 --> 02:34:14.190
glass, it manages to hit its mark and stay there,
like a dagger.

02:34:14.190 --> 02:34:16.212
MARISHA: I mean, that was pretty awesome, right?

02:34:16.212 --> 02:34:18.316
SAM: I think that was more you than the dagger,
though.

02:34:18.316 --> 02:34:19.248
MARISHA: That's true.

02:34:19.248 --> 02:34:22.077
TRAVIS: Why are y'all staying in another place
tonight?

02:34:22.077 --> 02:34:22.792
SAM: For safety.

02:34:22.792 --> 02:34:24.909
TRAVIS: Oh. Because of the thing?

02:34:27.709 --> 02:34:29.719
SAM: (loudly) Yes, because of--

02:34:31.239 --> 02:34:32.417
MATT: Horris isn't in the room anymore.

02:34:32.417 --> 02:34:36.672
SAM: Oh. All right.

02:34:36.672 --> 02:34:37.859
LAURA: You take your pants back off.

02:34:39.489 --> 02:34:42.512
SAM: Yeah, because of the thing. Caleb's idea.

02:34:42.512 --> 02:34:44.588
TRAVIS: You need any help? Backup?

02:34:44.588 --> 02:34:45.260
SAM: I'm the help.

02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:45.946
TRAVIS: Right.

02:34:46.476 --> 02:34:49.346
MARISHA: I think what Fjord meant was: can y'all
be trusted?

02:34:49.346 --> 02:34:55.471
LAURA: Exactly. Will you send a message to Caleb
and say, "Are we going to leave everyone else

02:34:55.471 --> 02:35:00.050
"tonight and steal the big ball?" Send a message to
him saying that.

02:35:00.050 --> 02:35:01.802
MARISHA: Very valid question.

02:35:01.802 --> 02:35:06.351
SAM: All right, sure. I take out my wire, I do my
incantation. I send a Message to him, I say:

02:35:06.351 --> 02:35:13.989
Caleb, are we going to abscond with the
dodecahedron in the dead of night? You can reply

02:35:13.989 --> 02:35:16.913
to this message, and only I can hear your reply.

02:35:18.253 --> 02:35:20.512
LIAM: Tell them I'm not going to run off with it.

02:35:21.482 --> 02:35:22.380
SAM: Yes, we are.

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:24.424
LAURA: Damn it!

02:35:24.424 --> 02:35:26.103
TRAVIS: Nott, why? Why are you going to--

02:35:26.103 --> 02:35:31.658
SAM: We're not going to steal it! He's scared of
that thing, why would we take it away from you?

02:35:31.658 --> 02:35:34.542
MARISHA: Seems like he's taken a few things that
he's afraid of.

02:35:34.542 --> 02:35:38.969
TRAVIS: Yeah, to be honest, that evening started
to take a turn before the Richter showed up. Do

02:35:38.969 --> 02:35:41.858
you know Caleb to be sticky-fingered like
yourself?

02:35:41.858 --> 02:35:44.390
SAM: We do what we need to do to survive.

02:35:44.390 --> 02:35:45.148
MARISHA: Wait, what happened?

02:35:45.148 --> 02:35:51.736
TRAVIS: Well, remember we were trying to leave no
trace? Caleb was the architect of the plan, and

02:35:51.736 --> 02:35:57.733
there was a scroll that looked like it might have
some magic to it, and he wanted to take it with.

02:35:57.733 --> 02:36:07.440
SAM: So what? The plan was to <i>leave</i> no trace,
not take nothing. He was very clear at the outset

02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:09.605
that we were doing this for money.

02:36:09.605 --> 02:36:13.787
MARISHA: You do realize that missing things mean
leaving a trace, right?

02:36:14.238 --> 02:36:15.074
SAM: No.

02:36:15.074 --> 02:36:17.656
TRAVIS: We were right there at the end, we were at
the finish line.

02:36:17.656 --> 02:36:24.813
SAM: We caused a giant explosion, we destroyed a
rug, we broke into two different places, Mollymauk

02:36:24.813 --> 02:36:34.763
was seen by guards outside of both; there was
plenty of traces we left behind. I opened a box

02:36:34.763 --> 02:36:37.055
that froze me for an hour!

02:36:37.055 --> 02:36:39.026
LAURA: I know, and I saved you!

02:36:39.026 --> 02:36:42.545
SAM: Yeah, I'm pretty sure someone's going to
notice that that box has been opened!

02:36:42.545 --> 02:36:44.988
MARISHA: You realize you're not helping your case,
right?

02:36:44.988 --> 02:36:51.322
SAM: I'm just saying, him taking a scroll is small
potatoes.

02:36:51.322 --> 02:36:55.547
MARISHA: We’d already fucked up the rug, we
probably shouldn't fuck up anyone else's house. We

02:36:55.547 --> 02:36:57.509
were already implicated at one place, right?

02:36:57.509 --> 02:36:59.783
TRAVIS: Nott, it's just a little reckless,
wouldn't you say?

02:36:59.783 --> 02:37:08.429
SAM: What Caleb does is well thought-out and
always intentional and smart.

02:37:08.429 --> 02:37:11.317
TALIESIN: You're a remarkable judge of character,
you know that?

02:37:11.317 --> 02:37:14.112
MARISHA: Are you aware of what Stockholm Syndrome
is?

02:37:14.112 --> 02:37:17.275
SAM: Stockholm Syndrome?

02:37:17.275 --> 02:37:17.697
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:37:17.697 --> 02:37:20.771
SAM: No, I'm not. Explain that to me.

02:37:20.771 --> 02:37:24.686
MARISHA: Yeah, it's an Emon thing.

02:37:27.446 --> 02:37:28.950
MATT: Gerald Stockholm.

02:37:30.490 --> 02:37:31.449
SAM: What are you implying?

02:37:31.449 --> 02:37:35.468
TALIESIN: I think what Beau is trying to imply
is-- I'm going to use something a little more

02:37:35.468 --> 02:37:38.700
basic. Do you know the story of the scorpion and
the turtle?

02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:44.762
SAM: Sure. The scorpion rides on the turtle's
back...

02:37:44.762 --> 02:37:46.508
TALIESIN: And then what happens?

02:37:46.508 --> 02:37:49.471
SAM: Whatever Caleb says happens next.

02:37:49.471 --> 02:37:53.456
(laughter)

02:37:53.456 --> 02:37:59.005
TALIESIN: The scorpion rides on the turtle's back
across a river. The scorpion stings the turtle,

02:37:59.005 --> 02:38:03.120
they both drown. What is the moral of this story?

02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:05.377
LAURA: Don't be a scorpion.

02:38:05.377 --> 02:38:08.117
SAM: Stay away from the water, is what I take from
it!

02:38:08.117 --> 02:38:11.801
TALIESIN: That's true, but the full point of this,
and the point I'm trying to make, is that with a

02:38:11.801 --> 02:38:16.719
group like this with very untrustworthy people,
you've got to trust each other-- because you have

02:38:16.719 --> 02:38:20.787
to trust somebody. You can't trust not anybody,
because you're just alone.

02:38:20.787 --> 02:38:24.762
SAM: All right, so you are all apologizing for not
trusting Caleb's judgment.

02:38:24.762 --> 02:38:26.086
TALIESIN: We don't trust you.

02:38:26.086 --> 02:38:27.484
LAURA: I trust you!

02:38:27.484 --> 02:38:29.942
TALIESIN: You've tried to steal from us twice.

02:38:29.942 --> 02:38:31.708
SAM: Not you.

02:38:31.708 --> 02:38:39.601
TALIESIN: You've tried to steal from <i>us</i>. Not
<i>me</i>, <i>us</i>. This is where the circle has to start.

02:38:39.601 --> 02:38:46.924
We will support you in doing some ridiculous
stuff, but you have to keep it outside.

02:38:46.924 --> 02:38:49.535
TRAVIS: We're looking out for you, I mean.

02:38:49.535 --> 02:38:55.554
TALIESIN: And that means sometimes you can't do
the thing you want because it's going to be better

02:38:55.554 --> 02:38:58.972
for everybody else, and sometimes everybody else
is wrong, but you have to go with it.

02:38:58.972 --> 02:39:02.242
SAM: All right, and what exactly have you done to
earn our trust?

02:39:02.242 --> 02:39:03.645
TALIESIN: Nothing, there's been no earned trust--

02:39:03.645 --> 02:39:04.365
LAURA: I saved you!

02:39:04.365 --> 02:39:10.762
TALIESIN: I actually did take a crossbow bolt,
knocked myself unconscious, trying to save your life!

02:39:10.768 --> 02:39:11.961
SAM: I'm not talking about life or death.

02:39:11.961 --> 02:39:12.896
TALIESIN: I saved your life!

02:39:12.896 --> 02:39:14.675
MARISHA: It doesn't matter, wait.

02:39:14.675 --> 02:39:17.058
TALIESIN: And it doesn't matter, we start from
scratch! This is where it starts!

02:39:17.058 --> 02:39:20.816
SAM: I've saved your lives, Caleb has saved your
lives--

02:39:20.816 --> 02:39:21.337
TALIESIN: When?

02:39:21.337 --> 02:39:29.024
SAM: Tonight. Caleb got that dodeca-fuckballs out
of there by himself.

02:39:29.024 --> 02:39:30.494
TALIESIN: We didn't want it!

02:39:30.494 --> 02:39:35.536
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, before we turn this into a
pissing contest--

02:39:35.536 --> 02:39:43.870
SAM: He has slain things, he has saved things, and
I have as well! If we're talking about trust, what

02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:53.308
on earth have any of you people done to earn our
trust? What have you done that we have requested? Ever?

02:39:53.308 --> 02:39:55.809
LAURA: I let you have a ring.

02:39:55.809 --> 02:39:58.715
SAM: I like you.

02:39:58.715 --> 02:40:04.078
MARISHA: It's not about earning each other's
trust. Look, I have worked with some skeevey

02:40:04.078 --> 02:40:11.970
motherfuckers in my day, very unsavory types. But
you know what I trust? That they have their own

02:40:11.970 --> 02:40:21.761
self-preservation, right? So I can trust that
these motherfuckers don't want to get caught, and

02:40:21.761 --> 02:40:30.886
that they don't want to die at the end of the day.
If you want to do something skeevey on the side,

02:40:30.886 --> 02:40:36.663
let me know, I will help you out. But when we are
all working as a team, I don't want your actions

02:40:36.663 --> 02:40:39.282
to get me in fucking trouble.

02:40:39.282 --> 02:40:43.088
TALIESIN: So if you really don't trust us, I'll
happily take that 40 platinum back, right now.

02:40:43.165 --> 02:40:49.322
MARISHA: We don't have to trust each other, but
when we are working on a job together, I want to

02:40:49.322 --> 02:40:55.675
know that you care enough about yourself that
you're not going to get me in trouble.

02:40:55.675 --> 02:40:57.250
TALIESIN: God, you're making me agree with her.

02:40:57.250 --> 02:40:59.311
MARISHA: Fuck you, Molly.

02:40:59.311 --> 02:41:01.403
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Fuck you.

02:41:01.403 --> 02:41:02.770
TALIESIN: See?

02:41:02.770 --> 02:41:10.216
SAM: When we signed up for this job, Caleb was
very explicit. He said we are doing this for coin

02:41:10.216 --> 02:41:12.635
and treasure, and that's what we got.

02:41:12.635 --> 02:41:14.484
MARISHA: I agree with that.

02:41:14.484 --> 02:41:18.360
SAM: There was no surprises here, we're in it for
what we can grab for ourselves.

02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:23.062
TALIESIN: No, we're in it for what we can all grab
together. That's how these things work.

02:41:23.062 --> 02:41:26.760
MARISHA: When you want to grab something for
yourself, you let me know, and you go grab it for

02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:33.372
yourself, I don't have to be a part of it. When we
choose one objective together, I can only trust

02:41:33.372 --> 02:41:41.583
that you are in it with us. We can be selfish as a
group, and then be selfish as individuals.

02:41:41.583 --> 02:41:45.673
TALIESIN: This is why the circus worked. This is
why the circus was functional.

02:41:45.673 --> 02:41:51.169
TRAVIS: You know, Nott, you count on Caleb to keep
you safe, right, to achieve greater things than

02:41:51.169 --> 02:41:57.555
you by yourself can achieve. Think how many things
you could do with all of us by your side. I'm not

02:41:57.555 --> 02:42:02.227
saying you don't have to be selfish, and I'm not
saying that you can't go after treasure and coin.

02:42:02.227 --> 02:42:05.048
SAM: I think there's a bit of a misconception here.

02:42:05.135 --> 02:42:06.401
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:42:06.401 --> 02:42:08.143
MARISHA: Is there?

02:42:08.143 --> 02:42:16.390
SAM: Caleb and I have a very special relationship.
It is that of a parent and a child. But <i>I</i> am the

02:42:16.390 --> 02:42:28.294
parent. You do understand that, correct? I protect
him. He's <i>my</i> boy, and I keep <i>him</i> safe. I want

02:42:28.294 --> 02:42:35.318
him to thrive and get better and better, and more
powerful and stronger. Because he can achieve

02:42:35.318 --> 02:42:42.964
great things. When I found him, he was nothing. He
was a scared little boy in the corner of a jail

02:42:42.964 --> 02:42:52.824
cell. As we have gotten more comfortable, he has
gotten more comfortable and come out of his shell.

02:42:52.824 --> 02:43:03.841
It's my job to protect him, because I love him,
and I am his protector. Not because he protects me.

02:43:03.841 --> 02:43:09.227
TALIESIN: So do you think it would be a good idea
to explain to him that he almost got himself

02:43:09.227 --> 02:43:17.598
killed tonight? Turning on a bunch of people he was
working with, he almost got himself killed tonight

02:43:17.598 --> 02:43:19.372
for nothing.

02:43:19.372 --> 02:43:23.489
MARISHA: You're not the only one who can have the
same interests in keeping each other safe.

02:43:23.489 --> 02:43:25.792
TALIESIN: And you're not nearly as smart as you
think you are.

02:43:25.792 --> 02:43:30.673
TRAVIS: If I may, thank you for sharing that,
Nott.

02:43:30.673 --> 02:43:32.655
MARISHA: Oh yeah, thanks.

02:43:32.655 --> 02:43:34.751
LAURA: That is so cute!

02:43:34.751 --> 02:43:39.776
SAM: He's going to be a great man someday.

02:43:39.776 --> 02:43:41.863
LAURA: He will! He really will!

02:43:41.863 --> 02:43:46.964
TRAVIS: That changes things. I admit that I had
the wrong idea about you two. I know what it's

02:43:46.964 --> 02:43:49.961
like to feel responsible for someone.

02:43:49.961 --> 02:43:55.015
MARISHA: Man, super shame that Caleb's not here
for this entire conversation.

02:43:55.015 --> 02:43:58.471
TALIESIN: I try not to have ideas about people,
they just get in the way.

02:43:58.471 --> 02:44:03.281
LAURA: I just want to go down there and hug him!

02:44:03.281 --> 02:44:06.541
TALIESIN: If you do, bring all of this stuff so he
can actually do something useful.

02:44:06.541 --> 02:44:10.132
MARISHA: Let's go down there, why don't we camp in
the cellar?

02:44:10.132 --> 02:44:12.227
SAM: That seems like it would be suspicious.

02:44:12.227 --> 02:44:14.833
TALIESIN: No, he created this situation, I'm all
right with this.

02:44:14.833 --> 02:44:17.470
LAURA: Does he know that you think of him like his
son?

02:44:17.470 --> 02:44:19.700
SAM: I don't know that.

02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:21.700
TALIESIN: Well, we get to tell him now, don't we?

02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:23.836
LAURA: No, we can't out her like that.

02:44:23.836 --> 02:44:26.916
TRAVIS: Nott, we want to take care of Caleb, we
do. We pulled him out of that house when that

02:44:26.916 --> 02:44:31.795
Fireball went off. We didn't cut and run, even
though it might have saved our skins. We care

02:44:31.795 --> 02:44:38.063
about you two. I hope in time you'll learn to
trust us just a little bit more. Maybe think about

02:44:38.063 --> 02:44:41.691
protecting us as well, because you seem to do a
great job taking care of Caleb.

02:44:41.691 --> 02:44:45.903
TALIESIN: And stop expecting people to earn
things. You just have to sometimes go with it.

02:44:45.903 --> 02:44:48.903
SAM: I'll have a talk with him.

02:44:48.903 --> 02:44:50.675
TRAVIS: I appreciate that.

02:44:50.675 --> 02:44:55.272
MARISHA: I mean, not as nice as what they said, if
he ever does anything to get me fucking locked up

02:44:55.272 --> 02:45:01.813
I will beat him so fucking bad his ancestors on
the next plane won't fucking recognize him.

02:45:01.813 --> 02:45:04.862
SAM: That's very nice, Beau.

02:45:04.862 --> 02:45:08.263
MARISHA: Thanks, I'm trying real hard.

02:45:08.263 --> 02:45:14.021
SAM: Yeah, I could tell that there was at least
six more fucks in there that you held back.

02:45:14.021 --> 02:45:17.702
(laughter)

02:45:17.702 --> 02:45:23.007
SAM: That's progress.

02:45:23.007 --> 02:45:27.507
MARISHA: Yeah, progress. I am an HR liability.

02:45:27.507 --> 02:45:30.916
LIAM: What about in the game?

02:45:30.916 --> 02:45:36.071
TRAVIS: So when are you planning to go down to
keep an eye on your boy?

02:45:36.071 --> 02:45:42.584
SAM: As soon as you give me the stuff you want
identified. And you'll have to trust me that we

02:45:42.584 --> 02:45:45.106
won't run away with it in the dead of night.

02:45:45.106 --> 02:45:48.847
LAURA: Oh, now I feel like you really will because
everyone was just mean.

02:45:48.911 --> 02:45:54.754
TALIESIN: We literally caught you stealing our
stuff. Here's an extra platinum.

02:45:54.754 --> 02:45:58.165
SAM: Hey, you're the one who hypnotized me into
talking about stuff.

02:45:58.165 --> 02:45:59.582
TALIESIN: I did.

02:45:59.582 --> 02:46:02.081
SAM: Yeah, you think that's what friends do to
each other?!

02:46:02.081 --> 02:46:04.418
TALIESIN: When they catch them stealing their
stuff, yes they do.

02:46:04.418 --> 02:46:06.577
SAM: I don't think so. You think that's cool,
Beau?

02:46:06.577 --> 02:46:08.785
MARISHA: You caught him stealing your stuff?

02:46:08.785 --> 02:46:10.091
LAURA and SAM and TALIESIN: Her!

02:46:10.091 --> 02:46:11.632
MARISHA: You caught her stealing your stuff?

02:46:11.632 --> 02:46:13.000
TALIESIN: Fjord's stuff, technically.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.896
SAM: I was not stealing! I was searching for
something to steal.

02:46:15.896 --> 02:46:17.430
TALIESIN: She was stealing.

02:46:17.430 --> 02:46:18.707
LAURA: What were you trying to find?

02:46:18.707 --> 02:46:20.485
SAM: That's besides the point.

02:46:20.485 --> 02:46:23.229
TALIESIN: Here, you can cast Friends on me, I'll
tell you everything you want to know.

02:46:23.297 --> 02:46:25.143
SAM: I don't have Friends, he hasn't taught me
that one yet.

02:46:25.143 --> 02:46:29.409
TALIESIN: Oh gods, suddenly I'm compelled to
answer everything truthfully! Oh no, more of

02:46:29.409 --> 02:46:32.141
whatever you're drinking, I can't help, stop, ack!

02:46:32.141 --> 02:46:35.498
MARISHA: This is the most I've liked either one of
you motherfuckers.

02:46:35.498 --> 02:46:37.247
TALIESIN: I feel that.

02:46:37.247 --> 02:46:40.456
TRAVIS: Nott, how about you take those items to
Caleb and call it a vote of confidence.

02:46:40.456 --> 02:46:42.733
TALIESIN: There was an extra platinum in there.

02:46:42.733 --> 02:46:45.605
SAM: All right.

02:46:45.605 --> 02:46:58.031
MARISHA: And I pull out my bo. And I put it down
and I say, but I'll find ya. If anything else happens.

02:46:58.031 --> 02:47:00.322
TRAVIS: I think he's got the point.

02:47:00.322 --> 02:47:02.692
TALIESIN: Take the items and the unearned trust
downstairs.

02:47:02.692 --> 02:47:05.938
SAM: Maybe you guys can have a talk with her
tonight.

02:47:05.938 --> 02:47:07.869
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's coming too.

02:47:07.869 --> 02:47:09.343
SAM: I know she's drunk, but--

02:47:09.343 --> 02:47:14.499
LAURA: She's pretty drunk. You're pretty drunk,
Beau.

02:47:14.607 --> 02:47:17.168
MARISHA: Y’all don't fucking know me.

02:47:17.168 --> 02:47:20.180
(laughter)

02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:22.638
SAM: I'm going to leave now.

02:47:22.638 --> 02:47:24.765
TALIESIN: Take the things, we'll see you in a bit.

02:47:24.765 --> 02:47:31.236
SAM: Have a good night, don't break into our room.
I'll go down with Caleb.

02:47:31.236 --> 02:47:34.630
MATT: Caleb, as you're sitting there talking to
your skull.

02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:36.960
LIAM: Oh, that was so brief. That was like five
minutes ago.

02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:41.329
MATT: The door opens and Nott scuttles in, closes
the door behind and comes and joins you.

02:47:41.329 --> 02:47:43.558
LIAM: How's it going up there?

02:47:43.558 --> 02:47:45.367
SAM: I stole this fucking scroll for you.

02:47:45.367 --> 02:47:51.166
LIAM: It's a scroll case, right?

02:47:51.166 --> 02:47:52.984
MATT: Which one are you handing him?

02:47:52.984 --> 02:47:54.546
SAM: The one from the Richter’s.

02:47:54.546 --> 02:47:56.020
MATT: That's right, yeah.

02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:59.578
SAM: I got it. I went back and got it.

02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:01.587
LIAM: Does anybody know you took
this?

02:48:01.610 --> 02:48:03.494
SAM: No.

02:48:03.546 --> 02:48:16.468
LIAM: I set it on the ground. I pull Nott closer
to me, and I give Nott a kiss on the forehead.

02:48:16.468 --> 02:48:19.742
Thank you.

02:48:19.742 --> 02:48:31.282
SAM: Thank you for saving me tonight. You brought
me back from the dead. Oh. I think you used a

02:48:31.282 --> 02:48:32.424
potion on me, didn't you?

02:48:32.424 --> 02:48:34.117
LIAM: Yeah.

02:48:34.117 --> 02:48:38.480
SAM: Here, take one of mine. I have two, it's
okay.

02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:40.333
LIAM: You are too kind to me.

02:48:40.333 --> 02:48:45.543
SAM: Of course. You keep me safe.

02:48:45.543 --> 02:48:55.896
LIAM: Well, you know, I think maybe you have
guessed it before now, but I care a great deal

02:48:55.896 --> 02:49:04.217
for you, and that is no small gift. Thank you.

02:49:04.217 --> 02:49:08.581
SAM: Thank you. We lived, huh?

02:49:08.581 --> 02:49:15.480
LIAM: Another day. You know, a little bit of me is
worried that this scroll case will explode, so I

02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:17.742
think we should check that out first.

02:49:17.742 --> 02:49:22.405
SAM: The folks upstairs gave me some more things
for you to check out as well. Are these things you

02:49:22.405 --> 02:49:23.628
can do?

02:49:23.628 --> 02:49:31.170
LIAM: Yeah, okay. I can get this done in about an
hour, I think. First, Nott, will you take the

02:49:31.170 --> 02:49:34.400
scroll case and put it on the other side of the
room?

02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:35.585
SAM: Okay.

02:49:35.585 --> 02:49:41.829
LIAM: Yeah. I'm tapped, so this is all ritual
spells now. So I will use a ritual spell to

02:49:41.829 --> 02:49:45.562
Identify the scroll case.

02:49:45.647 --> 02:49:54.522
MATT: Okay. The scroll case is a scroll case. It
does have a faint magical element to it. The

02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:57.807
limits of what Identify can--

02:49:57.807 --> 02:49:59.995
LIAM: How big is this room down here?

02:49:59.995 --> 02:50:05.438
MATT: I'd say it's about eight by 12.

02:50:05.438 --> 02:50:07.032
LIAM: Okay.

02:50:07.032 --> 02:50:08.953
MARISHA: So smaller than this.

02:50:08.953 --> 02:50:15.738
LIAM: This is going to be funny. I take another
ten minutes to summon Schmidt.

02:50:15.738 --> 02:50:17.189
SAM: Oh.

02:50:17.189 --> 02:50:19.228
LIAM: Come with me outside, okay?

02:50:19.228 --> 02:50:20.248
SAM: All right.

02:50:20.248 --> 02:50:28.277
LIAM: Okay. Schmidt, go open the scroll case. Come
on! I shut the door.

02:50:28.277 --> 02:50:30.916
MATT: Okay, you both back out, close the door.

02:50:30.916 --> 02:50:33.523
SAM: (explosion) Oh no!

02:50:33.523 --> 02:50:35.657
MATT: You hear (boom).

02:50:35.657 --> 02:50:40.401
LIAM: That is what I was afraid of.

02:50:40.401 --> 02:50:44.950
SAM: Oh shit! Was it loud enough that anyone else
could hear?

02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:46.369
MATT: You don't know.

02:50:46.369 --> 02:50:48.423
TRAVIS: Are you fucking serious?

02:50:48.423 --> 02:50:51.264
MARISHA: Did any of us hear it from the second
floor?

02:50:51.264 --> 02:50:54.729
MATT: Everyone else make a perception check,
please.

02:50:54.729 --> 02:50:59.180
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

02:50:59.180 --> 02:51:00.470
TRAVIS: Natural one!

02:51:00.470 --> 02:51:02.591
LAURA: Ten.

02:51:02.591 --> 02:51:04.998
MARISHA: 13.

02:51:04.998 --> 02:51:07.397
MATT: You hear a slight shift in the ground.

02:51:07.397 --> 02:51:10.032
SAM: It was that Agoura Hills earthquake.

02:51:10.224 --> 02:51:11.347
MATT: Exactly.

02:51:11.347 --> 02:51:13.185
LAURA: Did you just fart?

02:51:13.185 --> 02:51:17.890
TALIESIN: You would think so, but no. I think
they're doing something.

02:51:17.890 --> 02:51:19.450
MARISHA: What?

02:51:19.450 --> 02:51:20.621
TALIESIN: I heard something.

02:51:20.621 --> 02:51:22.191
MARISHA: Are they trying to fucking escape?

02:51:22.191 --> 02:51:23.352
TRAVIS: I'm just eating bar popcorn.

02:51:23.352 --> 02:51:25.766
TALIESIN: It sounded like a thump.

02:51:25.766 --> 02:51:27.207
MARISHA: A fucking thump?!

02:51:27.207 --> 02:51:28.721
LAURA: That doesn't sound like an escape.

02:51:28.721 --> 02:51:29.929
MATT: Everything's messy.

02:51:29.929 --> 02:51:33.833
LAURA: I hope they're not dead.

02:51:33.833 --> 02:51:37.355
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's something we can find out
in the morning.

02:51:37.355 --> 02:51:40.823
LAURA: Does our room look down onto the alleyway?

02:51:40.823 --> 02:51:43.236
MATT: Your room does not, no.

02:51:43.236 --> 02:51:51.400
LIAM: So, at this point, back up a little bit, and
I open the door and back up to see what I see.

02:51:51.400 --> 02:51:52.870
SAM: Smoke?

02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:57.431
MATT: A purplish dark fume wafts out.

02:51:57.431 --> 02:51:58.890
LIAM: I back away from it.

02:51:58.890 --> 02:52:04.123
MATT: You back away from it, and it dissipates
over the next 30 or so seconds. You keep watch to

02:52:04.123 --> 02:52:08.098
see if anybody else notices, and it doesn't. It
rises up, and thankfully by the time it would hit

02:52:08.098 --> 02:52:13.009
the roof as a smoke beacon, it mostly has
dissipated enough in the sky where it doesn't

02:52:13.009 --> 02:52:20.568
cause a column of visible darkness. The edge that
you're catching of it, the little bit that's

02:52:20.587 --> 02:52:28.575
wafting through, has this very fine metallic smell
to it, almost. The brief bit that catches your nostrils,

02:52:28.575 --> 02:52:36.284
you feel your sinuses open up very abruptly, and
like a mouth full of wasabi, it's like (coughing).

02:52:36.284 --> 02:52:39.972
Eventually it clears out, and you walk inside.

02:52:39.972 --> 02:52:44.020
LIAM: So not a ball of fiery death.

02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:45.929
MATT: No, not a ball of fiery death.

02:52:45.929 --> 02:52:50.379
LIAM: Okay, so it's cleared away, Schmidt's gone,
I assume.

02:52:50.429 --> 02:52:52.270
MATT: Schmidt is--

02:52:52.270 --> 02:52:57.516
LIAM: Well, if it wasn't damage-dealing, he's
still there.

02:52:57.516 --> 02:53:00.064
MATT: It might have been damage-dealing.

02:53:00.064 --> 02:53:04.581
SAM: I forget how this works, does he have your
hit points?

02:53:04.581 --> 02:53:06.524
MATT: Unseen Servant.

02:53:06.524 --> 02:53:08.661
LIAM: He has two. One or two.

02:53:08.661 --> 02:53:10.371
MARISHA: He has the hit points of a kitten.

02:53:10.371 --> 02:53:12.974
LIAM: One hit point.

02:53:12.974 --> 02:53:19.590
MATT: Oh yeah, Schmidt is gone. The scroll case is
open.

02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:29.643
LIAM: Okay, so it's clear. Next ritual spell that
I will cast, I will gather the other items, except

02:53:29.643 --> 02:53:31.644
for the dodecahedron.

02:53:31.644 --> 02:53:33.133
SAM: Was there anything in the box?

02:53:33.133 --> 02:53:39.439
LIAM: Well, we're about to find out. The
dodecahedron is in my satchel at this point. I

02:53:39.439 --> 02:53:46.280
push all the other items towards the case and
whatever is there, and I use ritual magic to

02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:51.394
cast Detect Magic everywhere. I just cast it.

02:53:51.394 --> 02:53:54.835
MATT: Both of the scrolls emanate-- You see within
the scroll case there's now two rolled-up scrolls

02:53:54.835 --> 02:54:03.412
inside there, and they emanate a magical aura. The
longsword emanates a magical aura, the boots

02:54:03.476 --> 02:54:09.251
emanate a magical aura, and your satchel is almost
distracting, the vibrancy of the magical source

02:54:09.251 --> 02:54:15.312
from that object, the crystal-looking object.

02:54:15.505 --> 02:54:20.263
LIAM: I rearrange my satchel so it's back by my
butt, so I don't have to look right at it. Okay,

02:54:20.263 --> 02:54:24.944
we have a little bit of work to do. I pick up the
scrolls and examine them.

02:54:24.944 --> 02:54:27.168
MATT: Okay.

02:54:27.168 --> 02:54:32.002
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:54:32.002 --> 02:54:34.971
LIAM: (gasps)

02:54:34.971 --> 02:54:36.836
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

02:54:36.836 --> 02:54:39.553
MARISHA: What, why are you getting teary, what is
happening?

02:54:39.553 --> 02:54:41.247
SAM: It's a good spell.

02:54:41.247 --> 02:54:42.357
MARISHA: Was it that good?

02:54:42.357 --> 02:54:43.998
LIAM: Come here, come here!

02:54:43.998 --> 02:54:45.017
SAM: What did we get?

02:54:45.017 --> 02:54:46.959
LIAM: I pick her up and I hug her.

02:54:46.959 --> 02:54:49.892
SAM: What did we get, what did we get?

02:54:49.892 --> 02:54:56.782
LIAM: This will be good for the group, this will
be good for you and me, this is good. It's

02:54:56.782 --> 02:55:01.391
something that I was not able to do. I've been
trying to figure it out for months and I have not

02:55:01.391 --> 02:55:03.197
been able to figure it out and now I have it.

02:55:03.197 --> 02:55:05.019
SAM: Yes!

02:55:05.019 --> 02:55:15.780
LIAM: Okay, let's look at these things for
everybody else. Okay. Ho, ho, ho, let's Identify

02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:21.109
all this shit! I spend the next 40 or so
minutes--

02:55:21.109 --> 02:55:22.746
SAM: <i>Sinterklaas</i>!

02:55:22.746 --> 02:55:24.190
MARISHA: Santa <i>Klaus</i>!

02:55:24.190 --> 02:55:30.043
LIAM: Ah. Yeah.

02:55:30.043 --> 02:55:35.264
SAM: Oh, and these daggers, too.

02:55:35.264 --> 02:55:44.063
LIAM: Beau might like these. These are good. Yeah,
these are good. Okay, so. All right, we'll put

02:55:44.063 --> 02:55:47.552
these away. This is a very good blade. This might
be a good blade for you. Why don't you hold on to

02:55:47.552 --> 02:55:49.617
it? You hold onto that.

02:55:49.617 --> 02:55:51.092
SAM: It's a longsword?

02:55:51.092 --> 02:55:52.148
MATT: It's a longsword.

02:55:52.148 --> 02:55:53.042
SAM: Can I use that?

02:55:53.042 --> 02:55:55.360
LIAM: Oh. Let me see. I thought that was the
daggers.

02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:57.594
SAM: (fake crying)

02:55:57.594 --> 02:55:59.056
LIAM: So the daggers are not magic?

02:55:59.056 --> 02:56:00.001
MATT: The daggers are not magic.

02:56:00.001 --> 02:56:00.930
LIAM: <i>Not</i> magic.

02:56:00.930 --> 02:56:01.904
MATT: They are just base daggers.

02:56:01.904 --> 02:56:04.295
LIAM: No, this is bigger than you.

02:56:04.295 --> 02:56:06.942
SAM: Too big for me. I know my limits.

02:56:06.942 --> 02:56:14.520
LIAM: Fjord or Molly would like this. They can
decide. They can decide. I mean, really, these

02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:20.164
boots are good for anybody. These are good for--
yeah.

02:56:20.164 --> 02:56:22.780
LAURA: Just tell us what they are! Just say it out
loud! Just say it!

02:56:22.780 --> 02:56:25.962
LIAM: No, I'll tell you on Christmas morning and
not before!

02:56:25.962 --> 02:56:27.791
LAURA: You're killing me!

02:56:27.791 --> 02:56:32.358
LIAM: We couldn't do this at <i>all</i> last campaign!
Now you have to wait 20 minutes!

02:56:32.358 --> 02:56:34.732
MATT: It's true.

02:56:34.732 --> 02:56:39.314
LAURA: (groans) I wonder if I have Identify I
could take...

02:56:39.314 --> 02:56:43.215
TALIESIN: There's a way to do it.

02:56:43.215 --> 02:56:45.557
SAM: Well, should we go to sleep?

02:56:45.557 --> 02:56:47.148
LIAM: Oh, boy.

02:56:47.148 --> 02:56:53.607
SAM: Oh, here's your 19 platinum, and your two
gold, and one extra platinum for some reason, as

02:56:53.607 --> 02:57:02.053
if that were supposed to smooth things over. Oh,
and also, they don't trust us, they think we need

02:57:02.053 --> 02:57:04.415
to cooperate more, they're trying--

02:57:04.415 --> 02:57:06.673
MARISHA: Oh!

02:57:06.673 --> 02:57:08.370
TRAVIS: Nope, you're not there.

02:57:08.370 --> 02:57:09.393
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:57:09.393 --> 02:57:10.796
SAM: They are very upset--

02:57:10.796 --> 02:57:12.420
MARISHA: I'm not, I'm speaking as myself!

02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:13.831
MATT and LAURA: (shushing)

02:57:13.831 --> 02:57:19.302
SAM: They were very upset that we tried to take
the scroll box.

02:57:19.302 --> 02:57:20.720
LIAM: Why?

02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:27.191
SAM: Because they are in the firm belief that it
would have left some sort of clue that would have

02:57:27.191 --> 02:57:33.999
led the authorities to us by stealing something,
after we had broken into two houses, stolen other

02:57:33.999 --> 02:57:35.892
things, torn up a rug--

02:57:35.892 --> 02:57:40.401
LIAM: That is the red flag. Not the arcane rug
that was destroyed and removed, covering his

02:57:40.401 --> 02:57:44.265
precious things. Not Jester disguising herself as
the High-Richter.

02:57:44.265 --> 02:57:45.878
SAM: Not stealing the seal.

02:57:45.878 --> 02:57:49.068
LIAM: And leaving witnesses who had seen someone
who was not the Richter going in before the Richter--

02:57:49.068 --> 02:57:53.588
SAM: Sure. Also, she was dressed as the Richter
not wearing the correct outfit.

02:57:53.588 --> 02:58:00.783
LIAM: Yeah. Ulog rifled through her desk and took
some papers from there, but I did not see Fjord

02:58:00.783 --> 02:58:02.562
tear him a new asshole.

02:58:02.562 --> 02:58:08.884
SAM: Sure. But they are under the impression that,
and this a fair point, that we are not very

02:58:08.884 --> 02:58:21.460
communicative or... We don't behave as much as
part of a team as they would prefer. I said that I

02:58:21.460 --> 02:58:30.816
would tell you and discuss. And so that's where
it stands with the weirdos.

02:58:30.816 --> 02:58:44.464
LIAM: Well, you know, I want this to work. So
whatever they need. I definitely do not agree, but

02:58:44.464 --> 02:58:47.191
whatever makes it work.

02:58:47.191 --> 02:58:54.197
SAM: I think what would make it work is letting
them take the lead a bit, and following.

02:58:54.197 --> 02:58:59.036
LIAM: Well, I have no interest in being a leader,
do you?

02:58:59.036 --> 02:59:01.252
SAM: Oh no, not at all.

02:59:01.252 --> 02:59:02.317
LIAM: No.

02:59:02.317 --> 02:59:13.704
SAM: But we can just see how it goes, playing
ball, I suppose.

02:59:22.195 --> 02:59:25.526
LIAM: Do you know that I was going to go to that
school one day?

02:59:25.643 --> 02:59:29.602
SAM: The Soltryce Academy thing?

02:59:29.602 --> 02:59:35.577
LIAM: Yeah. Didn't work out.

02:59:35.577 --> 02:59:39.946
SAM: What? You didn't get in?

02:59:39.946 --> 02:59:52.332
LIAM: Oh, I didn't get anywhere near it. I'm from
a small town, and there was a lot of hubbub for

02:59:52.332 --> 02:59:59.753
me, and maybe, you know, a gathering-up of coin. But
I fucked it up.

02:59:59.753 --> 03:00:08.783
SAM: Did you do something wrong? Or bad?

03:00:08.783 --> 03:00:15.872
LIAM: (whispers) Yeah.

03:00:15.872 --> 03:00:27.186
SAM: You don't have to tell me what it was, or
what you did, but is it something that you can be

03:00:27.186 --> 03:00:28.734
forgiven for?

03:00:28.734 --> 03:00:46.870
LIAM: (clears throat) That is not for me to say.
But I have no interest in going. I will do it on

03:00:46.870 --> 03:00:54.290
my own. Correction: I will learn with your help.

03:00:54.290 --> 03:00:58.123
SAM: Our own academy?

03:00:58.123 --> 03:01:01.914
LIAM: That's the idea. <i>Ja</i>.

03:01:01.914 --> 03:01:10.147
SAM: All right. It'll take a little longer,
probably. I'm not a good teacher.

03:01:10.197 --> 03:01:18.879
LIAM: Yeah, well, you know, anything worth going
after takes some elbow grease and hard work, so.

03:01:18.879 --> 03:01:31.681
SAM: All right, well. I'll help wherever I can. I
do enjoy seeing you get new spells and new skills.

03:01:31.681 --> 03:01:44.705
LIAM: I haven't had a friend in a very long time.
The last few months have been... unexpected.

03:01:44.705 --> 03:01:54.340
SAM: I think for me, too. I've had more people
throw rocks at me than conversations, and it's

03:01:54.340 --> 03:02:01.687
nice. You know what, it's nice with them, too.
They don't seem to mind that, you know, my teeth

03:02:01.687 --> 03:02:06.769
are a little-- People find that off-putting,
sometimes.

03:02:06.769 --> 03:02:16.098
LIAM: I do not. And I'll tell you another secret.
I like them, too. I get that they're angry. I

03:02:16.098 --> 03:02:19.259
don't agree with them. But I get it.

03:02:19.259 --> 03:02:21.711
SAM: Well, they're not as smart as you are, so.

03:02:21.711 --> 03:02:24.591
LIAM: Or you, I would argue.

03:02:24.682 --> 03:02:26.720
SAM: That's nice.

03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:36.343
LIAM: Well, you want to bed down with a
terrifying artifact of awesome power?

03:02:36.343 --> 03:02:37.812
SAM: I prefer the skeleton, actually.

03:02:37.812 --> 03:02:39.999
LIAM: Okay.

03:02:39.999 --> 03:02:41.698
SAM: I'll go on that side of the room.

03:02:41.698 --> 03:02:42.907
LIAM: Okay.

03:02:42.907 --> 03:02:46.211
MATT: All right.

03:02:46.211 --> 03:02:47.815
LIAM: Night, Nott.

03:02:47.815 --> 03:02:50.074
SAM: Night, Caleb.

03:02:50.074 --> 03:02:56.136
MATT: All right, so. As you guys all come to sleep
for the evening, first off, we'll consider this

03:02:56.136 --> 03:02:58.430
rest the milestone where you all hit level four.

03:02:58.430 --> 03:03:00.137
(cheering)

03:03:00.137 --> 03:03:06.778
MATT: So if you guys have decided on your
adjustments in advance, you can do that.

03:03:06.778 --> 03:03:08.649
SAM: How do you do this on D&amp;D Beyond?

03:03:08.649 --> 03:03:12.200
MATT: While you guys figure that out, if I could
have everybody but Caleb leave the table, please.

03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:14.545
LAURA and SAM: (surprised sounds)

03:03:14.545 --> 03:03:15.636
SAM: Oh no.

03:03:15.636 --> 03:03:16.591
LIAM: Get out of here.

03:03:16.591 --> 03:03:18.288
MARISHA: What is happening to you now?!

03:03:18.288 --> 03:03:20.325
TRAVIS: Yes!

03:03:20.325 --> 03:03:21.656
SAM: I'm in the room!

03:03:21.656 --> 03:03:23.051
MARISHA: Are we doing the level four thing now?

03:03:23.051 --> 03:03:24.174
LAURA: So we're doing it.

03:03:24.174 --> 03:03:25.728
MARISHA: Are we doing the level four thing, or we
doing it after?

03:03:25.728 --> 03:03:26.865
TRAVIS: Just wait.

03:03:26.865 --> 03:03:29.190
MATT: Just set up your stuff except for your hit
points; we'll roll those when you get back.

03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:30.253
MARISHA: Okay.

03:03:30.253 --> 03:03:31.387
TRAVIS: Pick up and walk.

03:03:31.387 --> 03:03:32.674
LAURA: Okay okay okay!

03:03:32.674 --> 03:03:34.150
SAM: Where do we go?

03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:35.213
LAURA: This way!

03:03:35.213 --> 03:03:36.397
TALIESIN: We're going this way.

03:03:36.397 --> 03:03:37.391
LAURA: Bye, Caleb!

03:03:37.391 --> 03:03:39.581
TRAVIS: I have to say it because Taliesin said it:
(whispers) Don't die.

03:03:39.581 --> 03:03:41.779
SAM: Bring your dice so we can roll.

03:03:41.779 --> 03:03:46.949
LIAM: I love you guys! I don't mean the Mighty
Nein, you're assholes, but I love you guys!

03:03:46.949 --> 03:03:49.431
MARISHA: I'll kill you in your sleep! Okay, bye!

03:03:49.431 --> 03:03:52.355
LAURA: You don't roll a d20 for hit points, Sam!

03:03:52.355 --> 03:03:54.099
MARISHA: Grab all the dice. Grab all the dice!

03:03:54.099 --> 03:03:55.159
LAURA: I'm grabbing my bag!

03:03:55.159 --> 03:03:56.797
MATT: Don't roll hit dice! Roll hit points when
you come <i>here</i>!

03:03:56.797 --> 03:03:58.244
SAM: How do you play Dungeons &amp; Dragons?!

03:03:58.244 --> 03:04:00.530
MATT: You won't need dice! You're fine.

03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:04.354
LIAM: We did it. We reclaimed our dignity. We did
it.

03:04:04.354 --> 03:04:22.331
MATT: We did it. Totally. So, as the dark takes your
dreams, sleep brings calm, brings peace, brings

03:04:22.331 --> 03:04:36.586
rest. There's a soft hum that seems to radiate
around you. A welcoming softness. A light, not

03:04:36.586 --> 03:04:43.182
quite white, not quite dark, it's a grayish,
familiar light, strangely. You feel it pull you

03:04:43.182 --> 03:04:58.581
forward, through stars. The distant night sky. You
see beacons of light coast by. You

03:04:58.581 --> 03:05:08.285
see a dark sphere before you. Then there's a flash
of light, and you're standing there and you're

03:05:08.285 --> 03:05:23.408
holding the object in your hand which you keep.
It's welcoming. You look into it for a moment, and

03:05:23.408 --> 03:05:30.952
look ahead, and you see yourself. And you see
another self. And you see another self. And a

03:05:30.952 --> 03:05:39.576
fourth Caleb, and a fifth Caleb, and an endless
row of Calebs, all slightly different. All begin

03:05:39.576 --> 03:05:46.466
walking in different directions at once. You look
down at the object and back up again and they're

03:05:46.466 --> 03:06:02.659
all gone. You see a distant flame flicker. You
feel yourself hypnotized by its movement. You look

03:06:02.659 --> 03:06:19.664
down again at it, and there's something wonderful
and ancient about this thing. You can't

03:06:19.664 --> 03:06:25.575
grasp it. Its scale is both too large and too
small. The more your mind tries to make sense of

03:06:25.575 --> 03:06:32.200
it, the more you feel yourself walking in 17
different directions at once. All those Calebs you

03:06:32.200 --> 03:06:38.671
saw before are all within you and they're all
pulling at different sides and it confuses you. It

03:06:38.770 --> 03:06:42.383
scares you for a moment, but once again you focus
back on this object and the warmth is comforting.

03:06:42.453 --> 03:06:55.036
You look up again at the stars; they've stopped
passing by. They're held in place. And for the

03:06:55.036 --> 03:07:02.553
first time in a long time, you feel at peace.
That's the end of your dream. All right, let's

03:07:02.553 --> 03:07:16.322
bring everybody else back in, please. You wake up
in the cold, dark basement of this relatively

03:07:16.322 --> 03:07:23.436
unused cellar beneath the Leaky Tap. Come to
consciousness with the most restful night's sleep

03:07:23.436 --> 03:07:30.242
you've had in a long time, it feels, almost. You
look over at Nott curled up right against your

03:07:30.242 --> 03:07:37.554
thigh, like a dog, asleep. Come on in.

03:07:37.554 --> 03:07:43.224
(laughter)

03:07:43.224 --> 03:07:46.036
SAM: I got scared of the skeleton so I came over
here.

03:07:46.036 --> 03:07:55.527
MATT: (laughs) All right. So, first off, let's go
ahead and get a roll of hit points here, so we have--

03:07:55.527 --> 03:07:56.912
LAURA: Oh, gosh!

03:07:56.912 --> 03:07:58.847
MATT: We haven't done this live on air before!

03:07:58.847 --> 03:08:01.071
LIAM: Oh man, here comes my extra one hit point.

03:08:01.071 --> 03:08:02.950
SAM: That was like <i>two</i> minutes.

03:08:02.950 --> 03:08:04.014
LAURA: We had <i>no</i> time!

03:08:04.014 --> 03:08:05.276
SAM: We had <i>no</i> time to do anything!

03:08:05.276 --> 03:08:10.995
MATT: That's okay. So go ahead and roll. As a
general rule, I reroll ones for hit points,

03:08:10.995 --> 03:08:16.906
because nothing sucks more for a character than
leveling up and rolling a one. So now two is the

03:08:16.906 --> 03:08:22.006
new sucky baseline. So go around the table. You
are rolling for hit points first, Fjord.

03:08:22.006 --> 03:08:23.235
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. A d8, right?

03:08:23.235 --> 03:08:24.716
MATT: d8 for the warlock, yes.

03:08:24.716 --> 03:08:26.782
TRAVIS: Seven.

03:08:26.782 --> 03:08:28.171
MATT: Seven, nice.

03:08:28.171 --> 03:08:31.814
MARISHA: d8 for the monk as well. A four. Right
down the middle.

03:08:31.814 --> 03:08:32.873
MATT: There you go.

03:08:32.873 --> 03:08:34.213
MARISHA: Plus my con modifier, yeah?

03:08:34.213 --> 03:08:35.272
MATT: Plus your con modifier, yes.

03:08:35.272 --> 03:08:38.127
TRAVIS: Yeah, really, con modifier?

03:08:38.127 --> 03:08:39.679
MATT: Yeah, every level. That's how it's always
been.

03:08:39.679 --> 03:08:42.729
TRAVIS: I just forget. 11 points.

03:08:42.729 --> 03:08:45.618
MATT: Caleb, d6.

03:08:45.618 --> 03:08:49.891
LIAM: Plus my con modifier, it's a total of six.
So I'm sitting at a big 25 now.

03:08:49.891 --> 03:08:51.050
MATT: Okay.

03:08:51.050 --> 03:08:53.216
SAM: I roll a d8?

03:08:53.216 --> 03:08:55.523
MATT: For you, yes. I believe it's a d8.

03:08:55.523 --> 03:08:58.218
LAURA: Whoa, nice!

03:08:58.218 --> 03:08:59.640
SAM: Eight!

03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:01.015
MATT: Nice! All righty.

03:09:01.015 --> 03:09:05.708
SAM: When I leveled up, it already gave me two
extra hit points. Why?

03:09:05.708 --> 03:09:07.747
LAURA: Because that's your modifier.

03:09:07.747 --> 03:09:09.101
MATT: That's your modifier.

03:09:09.101 --> 03:09:10.698
SAM: Okay, so now I add the extra eight.

03:09:10.698 --> 03:09:14.256
MATT: You add the eight to it. Yeah, it
automatically adds your level up to that. Roll yours.

03:09:14.313 --> 03:09:16.788
LAURA: Aw, three.

03:09:16.788 --> 03:09:18.312
MATT: There you go.

03:09:18.312 --> 03:09:20.331
TALIESIN: d10, no con modifier?

03:09:20.331 --> 03:09:21.673
MATT: No, you get con modifier.

03:09:21.673 --> 03:09:22.869
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:09:22.869 --> 03:09:24.645
MATT: Every class gets a con modifier to hit
points.

03:09:24.645 --> 03:09:30.131
TALIESIN: All right. Six!

03:09:30.131 --> 03:09:32.911
MATT: There you go.

03:09:32.911 --> 03:09:35.215
SAM: Oh my god, I just got <i>ten</i> extra hit
points!

03:09:35.215 --> 03:09:37.253
LAURA: That's amazing.

03:09:37.253 --> 03:09:38.762
MATT: All righty.

03:09:38.762 --> 03:09:46.743
LAURA: I feel like that was really bad. That was a
really bad roll.

03:09:46.743 --> 03:09:50.146
MATT: It's okay. Sometimes you get better rolls
than others.

03:09:50.146 --> 03:09:52.855
SAM: No, she's dead now.

03:09:52.855 --> 03:09:56.510
MATT: (laughs) If you don't roll at least four hit
points, you die in your sleep.

03:09:56.510 --> 03:09:57.766
LAURA: Yes, that's the rule.

03:09:57.766 --> 03:10:04.632
MATT: If you die in the level-up, you die in real
life. All right, so anyway, continuing. The hit

03:10:04.632 --> 03:10:07.306
points are the main thing, and your abilities, we
can keep tabs on that if it comes into play, and

03:10:07.306 --> 03:10:12.935
we can define stuff after the episode tonight. But
anyway. As you all come to consciousness in the

03:10:12.935 --> 03:10:16.164
morning, the day is before you. What do you wish
to do?

03:10:16.164 --> 03:10:19.826
TRAVIS: I'm going to see Horris.

03:10:19.826 --> 03:10:23.899
MATT: Horris is already awake and looking out the
window, and looks nervously.

03:10:23.935 --> 03:10:29.741
TRAVIS: Horris, do you need an escort out of town,
or do you think you can find your way?

03:10:29.741 --> 03:10:37.783
MATT: "I mean, an escort would be nice, just to have
somebody I can work with in case things go bad."

03:10:37.783 --> 03:10:40.081
TRAVIS: Of course. Have much coin do you have on
you?

03:10:40.081 --> 03:10:43.303
MATT: "On me? 20 gold."

03:10:43.303 --> 03:10:44.653
TRAVIS: Oh, you'll be fine.

03:10:44.653 --> 03:10:46.146
MATT: "It's enough to last me a while, yeah."

03:10:46.146 --> 03:10:48.719
TRAVIS: Molly? Molly!

03:10:48.719 --> 03:10:49.750
TALIESIN: Huh?

03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:54.657
TRAVIS: Wake up. I think I'm going to escort
Horris out. Be back as fast as I can.

03:10:54.657 --> 03:10:56.760
TALIESIN: All right, we'll wait for you.

03:10:56.760 --> 03:10:58.134
TRAVIS: All right.

03:10:58.134 --> 03:11:03.173
TALIESIN: I'm going to wake up and go see what the
girls are doing.

03:11:03.173 --> 03:11:08.343
MATT: Okay. You guys get to get your breakfast
started and such. You guys begin to walk, heading

03:11:08.343 --> 03:11:13.708
southward, since that was where the Alfield
suggestion was, making your way. The general

03:11:13.769 --> 03:11:18.555
bustle is still happening. There's still not a lot
of crownsguard on the street corners you're used

03:11:18.555 --> 03:11:23.055
to seeing them posted at, and as you make your way
towards the southern portion of the Interstead

03:11:23.055 --> 03:11:34.041
Sprawl, to the southern gate, you can see why. The
exit gates are <i>swarming</i> with crownsguard. The

03:11:34.041 --> 03:11:38.813
portcullis is down, with the smaller side doors
open, and every person who enters and exits is

03:11:38.813 --> 03:11:46.598
being interviewed and being checked as to whether
or not they're allowed to leave. It seems that

03:11:46.598 --> 03:11:50.748
lock-down is very serious during this
investigation. Horris immediately clamps up and

03:11:50.748 --> 03:11:54.411
grabs your arm and goes, "I don’t-- I don't
know--"

03:11:54.411 --> 03:12:01.660
TRAVIS: Stay casual, stay calm, just turn and
we're going to slowly start walking back. Just act normal.

03:12:01.660 --> 03:12:08.535
MATT: "Okay." You both slowly make your way
through that intersection and back, and no one

03:12:08.612 --> 03:12:13.553
seems to pay much mind. They're consumed with the
current hustle and bustle at the gate. As you guys

03:12:13.553 --> 03:12:19.853
are walking back, Horris is like, "Is there another 
way out? Is there someone, something you know--"

03:12:19.853 --> 03:12:24.317
TRAVIS: There always is. And if all else fails,
there's the sewers. You're not opposed to getting

03:12:24.317 --> 03:12:26.244
a little dirty to get out of town, are you?

03:12:26.244 --> 03:12:27.591
MATT: "No, no, no."

03:12:27.591 --> 03:12:34.307
TRAVIS: We'll want to wait until we have more of
the others, just in case. I'm afraid the sewers

03:12:34.307 --> 03:12:38.929
might be being cased as well, so stay put for a
little while longer, we'll find you a quiet spot

03:12:38.929 --> 03:12:41.683
in the Leaky Tap, but let me check with the
others.

03:12:41.683 --> 03:12:45.592
MATT: "Okay, okay." All right. As you guys are
getting the rest of your morning on, what do you

03:12:45.592 --> 03:12:47.173
want to do?

03:12:47.173 --> 03:12:48.609
LAURA: Get the rest of my morning on.

03:12:48.609 --> 03:12:49.619
MATT: Getting your morning on.

03:12:49.619 --> 03:12:51.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out, because I took
Tough--

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:52.346
MATT: Oh yeah, all right.

03:12:52.346 --> 03:12:53.771
TALIESIN: So I'm at 49 hit points

03:12:53.771 --> 03:12:54.595
SAM: Ooh!

03:12:54.595 --> 03:12:55.657
MATT: Damn, dude!

03:12:55.657 --> 03:12:56.821
SAM: That’s a lot!

03:12:56.821 --> 03:13:00.210
TALIESIN: But now I burn through more to use my
swords.

03:13:00.274 --> 03:13:03.559
SAM: Do we have to find Dolan now?

03:13:03.559 --> 03:13:09.616
TRAVIS: No, we found Dolan last night. He's going
to stay put in his house, low. We're going to try

03:13:09.616 --> 03:13:14.873
and assure that he's safe so that he can, you
know, put his name up for that High-Richter seat.

03:13:14.873 --> 03:13:18.654
MARISHA: We've got to figure out what we're doing
with this thing.

03:13:18.654 --> 03:13:23.489
TRAVIS: But listen, the gates, it's not a joke,
it's sealed. There are crownsguard swarming all

03:13:23.489 --> 03:13:28.268
over it. It seemed like they were doing personal
interviews, pat-downs, the whole smash, so even an

03:13:28.268 --> 03:13:30.391
enchantment might not hold up to scrutiny.

03:13:30.391 --> 03:13:34.453
LAURA: Wasn't there a woman who was also
(whispers) part of the Knights of Requital?

03:13:34.453 --> 03:13:35.579
MARISHA: Yeah, Kara.

03:13:35.579 --> 03:13:37.116
LAURA: What happened to her?

03:13:37.116 --> 03:13:39.493
MARISHA: She was the most shifty bitch.

03:13:39.493 --> 03:13:41.721
TRAVIS: We didn't see her last night. She wasn't
at Dolan's.

03:13:41.721 --> 03:13:43.468
LAURA: But she saw you guys.

03:13:43.468 --> 03:13:47.103
TRAVIS: Well, she saw-- Yes, she did.

03:13:47.103 --> 03:13:48.288
LAURA: At one of the meetings.

03:13:48.288 --> 03:13:49.242
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:13:49.242 --> 03:13:51.512
MARISHA: She never said a whole lot.

03:13:54.129 --> 03:13:57.331
LAURA: If anyone is going to turn us in, it would
be her.

03:13:57.331 --> 03:13:59.131
TRAVIS: Perhaps.

03:13:59.131 --> 03:14:01.941
MARISHA: She's the one I arguably know the least
about--

03:14:01.941 --> 03:14:04.134
LAURA: Where's Horris? Maybe he knows something
about her.

03:14:04.134 --> 03:14:09.822
MATT: You look behind Fjord at this point, and in
the doorway is Horris, arms crossed, biting his

03:14:09.822 --> 03:14:11.001
lower lip.

03:14:11.001 --> 03:14:12.013
LAURA: Horris?

03:14:12.013 --> 03:14:12.905
MATT: "Yes?"

03:14:12.905 --> 03:14:14.696
LAURA: Do you know where Kara is?

03:14:14.696 --> 03:14:20.722
MATT: "I honestly don't. We scattered when the
preparations were done to make sure we were far

03:14:20.722 --> 03:14:23.996
"apart so we couldn't be traced together."

03:14:23.996 --> 03:14:25.711
LAURA: Do you know where she lives?

03:14:25.711 --> 03:14:27.946
MATT: "I don't, actually."

03:14:27.946 --> 03:14:30.829
LAURA: Do you know what she does?

03:14:30.829 --> 03:14:40.458
MATT: "She says she occasionally works out of that
really terrible bar, the Evening--"

03:14:40.458 --> 03:14:43.675
LAURA: The Evening Nip? She works at the Evening
Nip?

03:14:43.675 --> 03:14:45.093
MATT: "I don't go there."

03:14:45.093 --> 03:14:48.954
LAURA: Okay.

03:14:48.954 --> 03:14:53.065
SAM: We've got to get our Nip on. Ooh, wait, maybe
not.

03:14:53.065 --> 03:14:58.730
MARISHA: Well, Jester and I know the code to talk
to the Gentleman if we ever want to do that.

03:14:58.730 --> 03:15:05.716
TRAVIS: Indeed. I was thinking that we might try
and get Horris out now. That way, if a crownsguard

03:15:05.716 --> 03:15:09.935
finds its way here-- maybe we should take him into
the sewers, get him out of the city.

03:15:09.935 --> 03:15:12.067
LAURA: Do the sewers lead out of the city?

03:15:12.067 --> 03:15:13.519
TRAVIS: I imagine.

03:15:13.519 --> 03:15:17.787
MARISHA: Generally when a city is on lockdown,
though, the sewers is the first place that guards

03:15:17.787 --> 03:15:20.253
are looking for shady people to leave.

03:15:20.253 --> 03:15:21.883
MATT: "That's true."

03:15:21.883 --> 03:15:28.017
MARISHA: Where's our cart? We still have our gypsy
wagon.

03:15:28.017 --> 03:15:30.267
SAM: Oh god, we haven't fed the horses in days.

03:15:30.267 --> 03:15:31.490
MARISHA: No, we haven't.

03:15:31.490 --> 03:15:32.835
(laughter)

03:15:32.835 --> 03:15:36.078
MATT: The horses are being taken care of. The
horses will be fine. The manticore head, though,

03:15:36.078 --> 03:15:38.642
that's probably a whole different order of
business.

03:15:38.642 --> 03:15:41.321
LAURA: The manticore head. Oh, I bet it smells so
bad!

03:15:41.321 --> 03:15:49.796
SAM: So we left the horses at a stable or
something? Okay. They're not dead in an alley

03:15:49.796 --> 03:15:51.101
somewhere?

03:15:51.101 --> 03:15:52.257
LAURA: Oh god.

03:15:52.257 --> 03:15:55.640
TALIESIN: Trying to rip the cart off the dead
horses.

03:15:55.640 --> 03:15:57.315
MATT: "Oh! Excuse me!"

03:15:57.315 --> 03:16:00.157
MARISHA: Is our cart in the city or is it outside
the city?

03:16:00.157 --> 03:16:01.825
MATT: No, you brought it in the city with you.

03:16:01.825 --> 03:16:06.890
MARISHA: We can bury him under a pile of produce
or something like that, try and sneak him out of

03:16:06.890 --> 03:16:07.972
the city.

03:16:07.972 --> 03:16:09.697
TALIESIN: I think we would need a proper smuggler
for that.

03:16:09.697 --> 03:16:10.701
TRAVIS: Indeed.

03:16:10.701 --> 03:16:12.662
TALIESIN: A well-built cart with a secret
compartment.

03:16:12.662 --> 03:16:14.210
SAM: Get a big catapult and just--

03:16:14.210 --> 03:16:16.221
MATT: "Do you know a smuggler?"

03:16:16.221 --> 03:16:20.491
TALIESIN: No, I don't know a smuggler. I don't
know anybody in this city.

03:16:20.491 --> 03:16:21.785
SAM: Wait, we know a smuggler.

03:16:21.785 --> 03:16:23.326
LAURA: Yeah, we do know a smuggler.

03:16:23.326 --> 03:16:25.392
SAM: Who was the guy who first showed us around
the city?

03:16:25.392 --> 03:16:27.681
LAURA: Ulysses! Ulysses Stanneras!

03:16:27.681 --> 03:16:28.843
TALIESIN: Oh god.

03:16:28.843 --> 03:16:29.799
SAM: Yeah.

03:16:29.799 --> 03:16:31.705
LAURA: He was in that yellow cloak. Remember?

03:16:31.705 --> 03:16:39.063
MARISHA: Also, you know who we haven't checked up
on? Bryce's sister. Right? Her sister?

03:16:39.063 --> 03:16:41.201
SAM: Their sister.

03:16:41.201 --> 03:16:45.672
MARISHA: Their sister, sorry. Bryce's sister.

03:16:45.672 --> 03:16:47.547
SAM: I totally forgot about that.

03:16:47.547 --> 03:16:49.004
TRAVIS: I did, too.

03:16:49.004 --> 03:16:54.508
SAM. And also there's the Gentleman, and also we
need a lead box. Oh my God, there's so much to do!

03:16:54.508 --> 03:16:58.329
LAURA: We need a lead box. Should we go try to buy
a lead box?

03:16:58.329 --> 03:17:02.367
SAM: Or maybe Pumat would have some sort of a
magical-encasing--

03:17:02.367 --> 03:17:05.594
LAURA: But how would we tell him why we need it?

03:17:05.645 --> 03:17:07.743
SAM: He doesn't care, does he?

03:17:07.743 --> 03:17:12.970
LAURA: Don't you think somebody would be asking,
"Who recently bought something that would protect

03:17:12.970 --> 03:17:14.666
"against scrying?"

03:17:14.666 --> 03:17:19.399
TRAVIS: Horris, we obviously have a lot to decide
on. Perhaps it would be better if you stayed up in

03:17:19.399 --> 03:17:20.543
the room.

03:17:20.543 --> 03:17:24.276
MATT: "I can do that. I'll lock myself in there,
and let me know if anything comes up."

03:17:24.276 --> 03:17:29.634
TALIESIN: We have some reading, if you like. I'm
going to grab the copy of Tusk Love.

03:17:29.634 --> 03:17:32.207
(laughter)

03:17:32.207 --> 03:17:34.185
TALIESIN: Try and relax. But not too much.

03:17:34.185 --> 03:17:40.802
MATT: "All right." Horris gives you a long look
of, "I've learned a lot about you in the moment."

03:17:40.802 --> 03:17:47.582
(laughter)

03:17:47.648 --> 03:17:49.943
SAM: We should write Tusk Love and sell it on the
store.

03:17:49.986 --> 03:17:55.653
MATT: I'm sure the community is already halfway
there, buddy. (laughs) All right. So, Horris is

03:17:55.653 --> 03:17:58.204
taken care of for the moment. What's the plan?

03:17:58.204 --> 03:18:02.999
MARISHA: Is Broken Veil the name of a tavern here,
or was it in Alfield?

03:18:02.999 --> 03:18:05.206
MATT: The Broken Veil?

03:18:05.206 --> 03:18:09.221
LAURA: I know I wrote it down.

03:18:09.221 --> 03:18:12.357
MARISHA: I think I messed up and I wrote down
where she is, but I don't know where--

03:18:12.357 --> 03:18:18.508
LAURA: I'm trying to find where I wrote down
Bryce's connections. I think I wrote it down in a

03:18:18.508 --> 03:18:20.151
different--

03:18:20.151 --> 03:18:21.515
MARISHA: No, wait.

03:18:21.515 --> 03:18:24.443
SAM: Was he in Alfield? She. They! Were they in
Alfield?

03:18:24.443 --> 03:18:26.228
MARISHA: Yes. Bryce is in Alfield.

03:18:26.228 --> 03:18:28.142
SAM: Bryce Fayled? Fell-lid? Fee-lid?

03:18:28.142 --> 03:18:38.668
MARISHA: Yeah. Feelid. Bryce Feelid. Watchmaster
Bryce Feelid. Elf. Leader of the guard. Very sweet

03:18:38.668 --> 03:18:40.983
person. These are all the things I wrote down.

03:18:40.983 --> 03:18:42.443
TRAVS: Great notes. Jesus.

03:18:42.443 --> 03:18:43.731
MATT: (laughs)

03:18:43.731 --> 03:18:45.939
TRAVIS: “Very sweet person.”

03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:50.561
MARISHA: Bryce despises the Dwendalian Empire,
thinks they get no support being so far south from

03:18:50.561 --> 03:18:57.225
the Dwendalian Empire. He's not from this region.
And then I wrote down ‘Broken Veil’ and ‘Bluffs’.

03:18:57.225 --> 03:19:00.337
LAURA: So it's got to be that.

03:19:00.337 --> 03:19:05.433
MATT: Okay, so yes, I know what you're talking
about now. Thank you for the heads-up on that. So

03:19:05.433 --> 03:19:15.867
the Broken Veil Bluffs is to the far, far east.
That is where the border of the Dwendalian Empire

03:19:15.867 --> 03:19:19.852
and Xhorhas is. It's actually where most of the
conflicts happen. It's where the garrisons exist.

03:19:19.852 --> 03:19:23.857
Where most of the army is sent to defend the
Empire in the valley.

03:19:23.857 --> 03:19:25.437
TRAVIS: Level four, <i>let's go!</i>

03:19:25.437 --> 03:19:29.686
(laughter)

03:19:29.686 --> 03:19:31.606
MATT: You are ready for this shit!

03:19:31.606 --> 03:19:36.708
LAURA: The radiation area in Fallout. It's like,
get out! Get out now!

03:19:36.708 --> 03:19:39.107
MARISHA: You're unprepared!

03:19:39.107 --> 03:19:41.343
TRAVIS: (computer voice) You are leaving the
combat area.

03:19:41.343 --> 03:19:45.799
MARISHA: So I didn't-- I don't have the name of
her <i>damn</i>--

03:19:45.799 --> 03:19:47.539
MATT: Their.

03:19:47.539 --> 03:19:49.066
MARISHA: Their damn sister!

03:19:49.066 --> 03:19:54.451
LAURA: And I can't find it in these notes either.
Shit.

03:19:54.451 --> 03:19:59.878
SAM: If Caleb was in the room when Bryce said it,
then Caleb would know.

03:19:59.878 --> 03:20:07.555
MARISHA: I think Caleb was, because it was right
when we said we were going to Zadash and Bryce was

03:20:07.555 --> 03:20:12.759
like, "Go look at this person." Sorry, I choked on
my spit.

03:20:12.759 --> 03:20:16.924
MATT: Bryce was the one that sent you to the Leaky
Tap. Bryce is the one that sent you to Claudia.

03:20:16.995 --> 03:20:17.964
LAURA: Yes.

03:20:17.964 --> 03:20:19.201
MARISHA: Wait, is Claudia his sister?

03:20:19.201 --> 03:20:19.955
MATT: No.

03:20:19.955 --> 03:20:20.929
MARISHA: Am I going around in circles?

03:20:20.929 --> 03:20:22.091
MATT: I think you're going in circles.

03:20:22.091 --> 03:20:23.647
SAM: There was no sister?

03:20:23.647 --> 03:20:25.692
MATT: I don't recall there--

03:20:25.692 --> 03:20:27.996
LAURA: --being a sister. It was Claudia!

03:20:27.996 --> 03:20:29.908
SAM: Well, if Matt doesn't recall the sister, then
it was Claudia!

03:20:29.908 --> 03:20:32.527
MARISHA: It was Claudia. Was it Claudia this whole
time?

03:20:32.527 --> 03:20:35.510
MATT: I was like, what did I say about Bryce's
sister, oh shit?

03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:37.462
MARISHA: It was Claudia. Never mind!

03:20:37.462 --> 03:20:38.657
SAM: Mystery solved!

03:20:38.657 --> 03:20:40.183
LAURA: No wonder I don't have it in my notes.

03:20:40.183 --> 03:20:41.810
MATT: There you go. Once again!

03:20:41.810 --> 03:20:43.063
SAM: We did it!

03:20:43.063 --> 03:20:44.692
LAURA: We figured it out!

03:20:44.692 --> 03:20:46.708
TRAVIS: Chat's like, "Fucking idiots."

03:20:46.708 --> 03:20:50.090
MATT: If I did say sister, remind me.

03:20:50.090 --> 03:20:56.686
SAM: Well, that takes one thing off the list. We
still need: The lead box! Get Horris out of town!

03:20:56.686 --> 03:20:59.715
The Gentleman! What else?

03:20:59.715 --> 03:21:01.742
TRAVIS: The Leaky Nip. What's it called?

03:21:01.742 --> 03:21:02.853
LAURA: The Evening Nip.

03:21:02.853 --> 03:21:04.660
SAM: That's the Gentleman also.

03:21:04.725 --> 03:21:06.050
MATT: The Leaky Nip?!

03:21:06.050 --> 03:21:07.758
LAURA: That's going to be me in a few months.

03:21:07.758 --> 03:21:09.341
TALIESIN: Bam! Bam!

03:21:09.341 --> 03:21:11.740
MATT: That's a different establishment.

03:21:11.740 --> 03:21:15.783
(laughter)

03:21:15.783 --> 03:21:17.464
TALIESIN: That's a daycare.

03:21:17.464 --> 03:21:25.280
LIAM: Wow. This ain't your kids' D&amp;D, right there!

03:21:25.280 --> 03:21:32.787
SAM: The Leaky Nip? I mean, the Evening Nip,
should we go there?

03:21:32.787 --> 03:21:36.579
LAURA: No, we need a lead box, that's
probably more important.

03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:39.181
MARISHA: And get Horris out first, right?

03:21:39.181 --> 03:21:40.552
TRAVIS: Pumat's got to have a--

03:21:40.552 --> 03:21:43.186
LAURA: Or a blacksmith. I feel like a blacksmith
would be more--

03:21:43.186 --> 03:21:47.855
SAM: He was telling us about blacksmiths before.
There's the Spark Hammer Smith. We could go to the

03:21:47.855 --> 03:21:50.129
Spark Hammer Smith in the Pentamarket.

03:21:50.129 --> 03:21:51.669
LAURA: Yeah. Let's go to that.

03:21:51.669 --> 03:21:53.088
TRAVIS: Have we been there yet?

03:21:53.088 --> 03:21:54.398
SAM: I think we actually have been there before.

03:21:54.398 --> 03:21:55.679
LAURA: Yeah, that was the first place we went.

03:21:55.679 --> 03:21:57.230
SAM: Yannick. Jan?

03:21:57.230 --> 03:21:58.666
MATT: Caleb.

03:21:58.666 --> 03:21:59.611
LIAM: Yeah?

03:21:59.611 --> 03:22:01.704
MATT: For the hell of it, make an arcana check.

03:22:01.704 --> 03:22:04.255
LIAM: Sure. I've just been nerding out over my
leveling up over here.

03:22:04.255 --> 03:22:05.316
MATT: I know.

03:22:05.316 --> 03:22:07.987
SAM: He got 75 new spells.

03:22:08.072 --> 03:22:09.468
LIAM: Oh, I rolled a one, Matthew.

03:22:09.468 --> 03:22:10.922
MATT: Fuck, okay.

03:22:10.922 --> 03:22:12.410
TRAVIS: I rolled a natural 20.

03:22:12.410 --> 03:22:14.646
LIAM: I rolled it really badly. I'm not good at
dice.

03:22:14.646 --> 03:22:16.619
MATT: It's fine. All right, continue.

03:22:16.619 --> 03:22:18.581
LAURA: You need to take Luck as a feat again.

03:22:18.581 --> 03:22:21.127
LIAM: It doesn't always work out for you anyway.

03:22:21.127 --> 03:22:22.823
TRAVIS: I know magic some!

03:22:22.823 --> 03:22:27.474
SAM: I'm a student of magic.

03:22:27.474 --> 03:22:29.495
TRAVIS: Not enough, DM says.

03:22:29.495 --> 03:22:34.216
MATT: It's not about not enough, it's placement
and what you have and where you are. So what are

03:22:34.216 --> 03:22:35.680
you guys doing?

03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:41.550
SAM: We're going to go to the Spark Hammer
Smith's. Smithy's.

03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:43.835
MARISHA: Yannick and Jan.

03:22:43.835 --> 03:22:51.664
MATT: You find your way there. Yannick is inside
currently, working on hammering out the edges of a

03:22:51.720 --> 03:22:55.716
piece of armor. "Hello. Can I help you?"

03:22:55.716 --> 03:22:59.810
LAURA: Yes. Do you make anything out of lead?

03:22:59.810 --> 03:23:05.537
MATT: "I mean, I certainly can. Depends what
you're hoping to have made."

03:23:05.537 --> 03:23:14.237
LAURA: Could you perhaps make me a really pretty--
so, my mother is a big fan of things made out of

03:23:14.237 --> 03:23:16.923
lead. She said she likes the color of that metal.

03:23:16.923 --> 03:23:20.681
MATT: "That's a very curious liking, but sure,
I'll take it."

03:23:20.681 --> 03:23:25.370
LAURA: She gets a lot of things in gold and
stuff and so she says that lead looks very

03:23:25.433 --> 03:23:27.525
different from that and she thinks it's pretty.

03:23:27.525 --> 03:23:29.269
MATT: "Hey, I'm not judging."

03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:33.790
LAURA: So I want to make her a really pretty
jewelry box out of lead.

03:23:33.790 --> 03:23:40.360
MATT: The halfling scratches his temple and goes,
"Well, I mean, if you're willing to pay, I can make it."

03:23:40.422 --> 03:23:45.399
LAURA: Okay! It's like she has a lot of jewelry,
so something like around this big.

03:23:45.399 --> 03:23:49.339
MATT: "It's going to be a lot of lead, and a few
days to make it."

03:23:49.339 --> 03:23:55.639
SAM: Can it just be lead-lined? Is that a thing?

03:23:55.639 --> 03:23:59.547
LIAM: It can be thin as a sheet of parchment.

03:23:59.652 --> 03:24:06.051
LAURA: Oh, so not a whole lead box, maybe like a
box made out of wood and then pretty lead on the inside.

03:24:06.086 --> 03:24:08.799
MATT: "That there's a little more easy 
to put together."

03:24:09.011 --> 03:24:12.057
LAURA: Or maybe on the outside so she doesn't
realize it's not made of lead?

03:24:12.057 --> 03:24:15.629
LIAM: It doesn't need to be as-- Am I here? I've
been doing this with my spells.

03:24:15.693 --> 03:24:17.730
MATT: That's up to you. Sure.

03:24:17.730 --> 03:24:21.094
LIAM: It needs to be sealed all the way around and
be able to close.

03:24:21.094 --> 03:24:23.299
LAURA: He's a good friend of my mom's.

03:24:23.366 --> 03:24:24.374
MATT: "Right."

03:24:24.374 --> 03:24:26.193
SAM: Everybody knows her mom.

03:24:26.193 --> 03:24:33.306
MATT: "Okay, we’ll go ahead and get started on
that there. Full cost to you, two days' work, materials.

03:24:33.428 --> 03:24:37.860
"That'll run you back about one and a half gold.
One gold, five silver."

03:24:37.860 --> 03:24:41.331
LAURA: I think that is acceptable, yes.

03:24:41.331 --> 03:24:42.609
MATT: "All right."

03:24:42.609 --> 03:24:51.217
LAURA: Here. Will you also engrave it with, "Love
you so much"?

03:24:51.268 --> 03:24:53.037
MATT: "It'll be an additional silver."

03:24:53.037 --> 03:24:54.118
LAURA: Okay.

03:24:54.118 --> 03:24:58.149
MATT: "All right. Come back here in about 48
hours. Should be good."

03:24:58.207 --> 03:25:01.064
LAURA: Okay. If we give you more, could you make it
faster?

03:25:01.122 --> 03:25:02.480
MATT: "I could certainly do my best."

03:25:02.696 --> 03:25:06.291
LAURA: I noticed they’re blocking up the gates,
and I need to get it to her because her birthday’s

03:25:06.291 --> 03:25:07.946
coming up.

03:25:07.946 --> 03:25:12.668
MATT: "I am but one small halfling, so you’re
going to have to wait one way or the other."

03:25:12.668 --> 03:25:14.545
LAURA: All right.

03:25:14.545 --> 03:25:15.674
MATT: "Sorry."

03:25:15.674 --> 03:25:17.963
LAURA: Okay. Thank you.

03:25:17.963 --> 03:25:19.430
MATT: "No worries, mate! Come back then."

03:25:19.430 --> 03:25:25.032
MARISHA: Our blacksmith is Taika Waititi. So into
it.

03:25:25.032 --> 03:25:33.078
LIAM: Are we all in a group, though? Sorry, I
really did have my head up the ass of level four.

03:25:33.165 --> 03:25:36.290
MATT: You guy haven’t said you’ve split, so I
imagine you’re all as a group.

03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:39.402
LAURA: That’s a couple days.

03:25:39.402 --> 03:25:41.899
LIAM: Okay.

03:25:41.899 --> 03:25:46.603
LAURA: Should we check with Pumat Sol and see if
he has something like that?

03:25:46.603 --> 03:25:51.612
LIAM: Like a lead-- I would pay premium price to
get a hold of a lead box right away.

03:25:51.612 --> 03:25:54.580
MARISHA: You all keep talking about this Pumat Sol
guy.

03:25:54.580 --> 03:25:59.711
TRAVIS: Have you not been to the Invulnerable
Gentleclerk?

03:25:59.711 --> 03:26:06.143
MARISHA: No. I don’t do the magic stuff. I tend to
do other things.

03:26:06.143 --> 03:26:11.425
LIAM: Yeah, but this is more like an experience,
like Sleep No More. You have to go and--

03:26:11.425 --> 03:26:12.943
MARISHA: Oh, really?

03:26:12.943 --> 03:26:19.991
LIAM: Yeah, you have to see it for yourself. We do
have a lot to do, but this is a functional trip as well.

03:26:19.991 --> 03:26:22.811
TALIESIN: I’m normally not impressed by
eccentrics, so this is really impressive.

03:26:22.811 --> 03:26:29.688
LIAM: This is a functional trip as well. A
gentleman like Pumat Sol-- gentlemen like Pumat

03:26:29.688 --> 03:26:37.067
Sols-- would most likely-- because they understand
divination, and the needs of the arcane.

03:26:37.088 --> 03:26:39.048
MARISHA: See, it feels like an inside joke.

03:26:39.048 --> 03:26:40.327
TALIESIN: It is.

03:26:40.327 --> 03:26:41.674
LIAM: We want you to be in on it.

03:26:41.674 --> 03:26:48.383
LAURA: He would be more aware of what we're
asking for, if we asked for it. As opposed to the

03:26:48.418 --> 03:26:49.488
blacksmith.

03:26:49.488 --> 03:26:51.304
LIAM: Yeah, he would not be surprised by the
question.

03:26:51.304 --> 03:26:52.245
LAURA: Okay.

03:26:52.245 --> 03:26:54.688
LIAM: Also, come over here. Please.

03:26:54.688 --> 03:26:55.913
LAURA: Just me?

03:26:55.913 --> 03:26:59.490
LIAM: Well, whoever-- everybody hears this. Come
closer. Yeah, so--

03:26:59.544 --> 03:27:01.546
TRAVIS: (belches loudly)

03:27:01.546 --> 03:27:06.588
(laughter)

03:27:06.588 --> 03:27:08.454
MATT: My hair went (wind sounds) on that one.

03:27:08.454 --> 03:27:11.839
LIAM: I look around to see if anyone was
distracted by Fjord’s large belch.

03:27:11.839 --> 03:27:15.362
MATT: At the moment, no. It seems to be a common
thing here in the Pentamarket.

03:27:15.362 --> 03:27:21.684
LIAM: All right. I know you’re all a big fan of my
sticky fingers. I took this from Sutan’s house.

03:27:21.684 --> 03:27:23.310
SAM: What is that? What does it do?

03:27:23.310 --> 03:27:24.593
LAURA: What is it?

03:27:24.593 --> 03:27:28.381
LIAM: It is a sending stone. It's a communication
device. This was in Sutan’s house. This was under

03:27:28.443 --> 03:27:30.512
the rug that we destroyed and removed.

03:27:30.512 --> 03:27:32.426
LAURA: That attacked us, you mean.

03:27:32.426 --> 03:27:37.278
LIAM: Yes, of course. We did what we had to do. We
improvised. Like Fjord told me the other day: you

03:27:37.333 --> 03:27:46.074
have to improvise. This stone has a twin somewhere
and we can talk with it. I don’t know who it is.

03:27:46.074 --> 03:27:54.239
Honestly, my opinion is, the probability of
someone trying to find us, searching for this

03:27:54.271 --> 03:28:00.884
thing, is like looking for a needle in a haystack
in a newly made warzone. However, in the meantime,

03:28:00.937 --> 03:28:05.456
I was wondering if you’d hold it inside of your
fancy bag, because--

03:28:05.456 --> 03:28:07.819
LAURA: Will they be able to find it through the
fancy bag?

03:28:07.886 --> 03:28:13.800
LIAM: I believe not, because inside your bag is
somewhere else. It is not even on this plane.

03:28:13.882 --> 03:28:17.970
LAURA: I hold it up to my ear. Is anybody trying
to talk to me right now?

03:28:17.970 --> 03:28:19.935
MATT: Not at the moment.

03:28:19.935 --> 03:28:23.621
LIAM: Let’s put that in your bag right away, because 
we don’t know what’s on the other side of it.

03:28:23.834 --> 03:28:28.755
LAURA: How do we-- oh, okay. Can they hear me
talking to it right now?

03:28:28.811 --> 03:28:34.501
LIAM: There is a very, very small chance the answer 
is yes, so please put it in your bag right now.

03:28:34.527 --> 03:28:37.345
MARISHA: So you started stealing stuff in the
first house?

03:28:37.345 --> 03:28:40.828
LIAM: Yeah. That is what I said that I was going
to do.

03:28:40.828 --> 03:28:44.501
TRAVIS: To be fair, he did say that.

03:28:44.501 --> 03:28:46.789
TALIESIN: We had the talk. I’m willing to let it
slide.

03:28:46.789 --> 03:28:49.292
MARISHA: We had the talk with her

03:28:49.292 --> 03:28:53.143
TALIESIN: That’s fair. Ah! Sword. Boots. Daggers.

03:28:53.143 --> 03:28:55.011
LAURA: Wait. Don’t pass it out out here.

03:28:55.011 --> 03:28:56.779
TALIESIN: Oh, not right here, of course.

03:28:56.842 --> 03:28:59.271
LIAM: Do we want to do it before Pumat, or after
Pumat?

03:28:59.271 --> 03:29:01.191
LAURA: Before.

03:29:01.191 --> 03:29:09.531
SAM: One little interjection. Couldn’t we use the
sending thing to find out information if we sent a

03:29:09.531 --> 03:29:10.536
message?

03:29:10.536 --> 03:29:14.213
LIAM: All we could do is say hello to a stranger.
We don’t know who it is.

03:29:14.213 --> 03:29:16.431
LAURA: Would it hear our voice, or would it-- ?

03:29:16.431 --> 03:29:17.908
LIAM: It would hear our voice.

03:29:17.908 --> 03:29:25.082
SAM: We could disguise our voice and say, "We’ve
been made! Send instructions!" and find out what

03:29:25.082 --> 03:29:26.136
happens.

03:29:26.136 --> 03:29:30.125
LIAM: That is true. Just keep it in the bag for
now, just in case.

03:29:30.191 --> 03:29:32.175
MARISHA: That’s pretty good, though.

03:29:32.175 --> 03:29:38.000
LIAM: Yeah. We could certainly roll this over in
our minds and see if there’s something we could do

03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:44.410
with it. If someone is going to look for this
thing-- and, again, probability very low-- but if

03:29:44.476 --> 03:29:47.603
they were going to look, it’d be right away. It’d
be a couple of weeks.

03:29:47.603 --> 03:29:54.393
LAURA: What if we say to it, "Hey man! We found
this stone on the ground. Who do you belong to?"

03:29:54.393 --> 03:29:58.461
What do you think?

03:29:58.461 --> 03:30:07.538
TALIESIN: I think that’s-- It could be dangerous.
It’s better if they initiate, because then we learn

03:30:07.772 --> 03:30:09.133
information immediately.

03:30:09.133 --> 03:30:12.801
SAM: Sometimes if you scroll through and find a
listing for mom?

03:30:12.839 --> 03:30:15.177
LAURA: I know, and then you call the mom?

03:30:15.177 --> 03:30:19.176
LIAM: I believe possible that at some point a
message could come through it.

03:30:19.176 --> 03:30:20.502
TALIESIN: That’s what I was thinking.

03:30:20.502 --> 03:30:23.960
LIAM: But we don’t know. I just want-- for the
next two to four weeks-- I would prefer to keep it

03:30:24.026 --> 03:30:32.279
either in a lead-lined container or in that bag. Chances
are small, but if someone was <i>really</i> determined.

03:30:32.344 --> 03:30:33.253
LAURA: Okay.

03:30:33.253 --> 03:30:34.427
LIAM: It’s possible.

03:30:34.427 --> 03:30:38.313
LAURA: All right. It's in the bag.

03:30:38.313 --> 03:30:40.201
TRAVIS: Pumat, or the rest of the equipment?

03:30:40.201 --> 03:30:45.668
SAM: We could probably divvy up the equipment at
Pumat's. He won’t ask any questions.

03:30:45.668 --> 03:30:46.931
TRAVIS: Let’s do it.

03:30:46.931 --> 03:30:49.688
LAURA: How do you know? How do you know he's not
working for the Empire?

03:30:49.688 --> 03:30:50.995
TRAVIS: He’s pretty nice.

03:30:50.995 --> 03:30:54.144
LAURA: The only store in the Empire.

03:30:54.144 --> 03:30:55.949
TRAVIS: He seems like a nice guy.

03:30:55.949 --> 03:30:57.788
LAURA: He's probably working for the Empire.

03:30:57.788 --> 03:31:04.149
LIAM: I would agree with Fjord's sentiment. If we
took it out of my own bag-- There's four of Pumats

03:31:04.196 --> 03:31:07.732
so one of those Pumats would see it coming out of
my own stuff.

03:31:07.732 --> 03:31:10.124
TRAVIS: Plus, we’re returning customers.

03:31:10.124 --> 03:31:11.731
LIAM: Yeah, that’s also true.

03:31:11.731 --> 03:31:15.067
MARISHA: Wait, what are you agreeing with? That
he's nice or that he's working for the Empire?

03:31:15.120 --> 03:31:16.561
LIAM: No, that he's nice.

03:31:16.561 --> 03:31:17.842
MARISHA: Okay.

03:31:17.842 --> 03:31:19.484
LAURA: I don’t want to trust him.

03:31:19.484 --> 03:31:23.324
LIAM: We could also go to a breakfast shop and do
it there.

03:31:23.324 --> 03:31:27.692
MARISHA: The two aren't mutually exclusive. We
know that, right? He can be nice and working for

03:31:27.749 --> 03:31:28.754
the Empire.

03:31:28.754 --> 03:31:30.361
LAURA: I had a dream about Pumat Sol attacking
us.

03:31:30.361 --> 03:31:31.331
SAM: You did not!

03:31:31.331 --> 03:31:32.311
TRAVIS: Attacking us?

03:31:32.311 --> 03:31:33.967
LAURA: I did. I had a dream about it.

03:31:33.967 --> 03:31:35.409
SAM: What?! That seems terrible!

03:31:35.409 --> 03:31:37.261
LAURA: This is Laura actually. I did have a
dream.

03:31:37.261 --> 03:31:39.738
MATT: What, are you serious? That’s terrifying!

03:31:39.738 --> 03:31:42.744
TALIESIN: I was starting to go in that direction
of: Is this a real thing?

03:31:42.744 --> 03:31:46.039
LAURA: No, it really was. It was a dream that
Pumat Sol betrayed us and he attacked us all.

03:31:46.039 --> 03:31:47.694
Anyway--

03:31:47.694 --> 03:31:51.089
TALIESIN: This is Clarota aftershock.

03:31:51.122 --> 03:31:53.714
LAURA: I’m just letting you know. We don't know
anything about him.

03:31:53.714 --> 03:31:56.541
SAM: Oh my god.

03:31:56.541 --> 03:32:00.144
TRAVIS: I think if you give him a chance, he'll do
you right.

03:32:00.144 --> 03:32:04.492
SAM: (banjo music)

03:32:04.492 --> 03:32:11.697
LAURA: Anyway, I don't want to bring out all of
this stuff from the assassin guy in front of him!

03:32:11.697 --> 03:32:18.542
TALIESIN: Let's go shopping at Pumat Sol’s and
then we’ll divvy up everything when we’re in private.

03:32:18.542 --> 03:32:23.859
MATT: You guys making your way to the
Pentamarket?

03:32:23.859 --> 03:32:25.192
LAURA: Yes.

03:32:25.192 --> 03:32:26.661
LIAM: (Pumat voice) Respectfully, we are.

03:32:26.661 --> 03:32:33.698
MATT: Okay. It’s still early morning, relatively.
You make your way to the warm, welcoming interior

03:32:33.766 --> 03:32:40.411
of the Invulnerable Vagrant. There are no other
patrons in there. You do see, across the way, one

03:32:40.411 --> 03:32:46.903
Pumat Sol is sitting behind the counter with
knitting needles. There is one off to the side in

03:32:46.903 --> 03:32:51.542
a chair that’s currently reading through a book,
the small set of glasses on the tip of his wide

03:32:51.542 --> 03:33:00.465
nose. They both look up and go, "Why, hello there!
That's just a real nice thing to see you this

03:33:00.465 --> 03:33:08.255
"early in the morning. Just about to finish my
breakfast snack, so you caught me at a good time."

03:33:08.255 --> 03:33:10.649
MARISHA: The fuck?

03:33:10.649 --> 03:33:13.241
LAURA: Are you open all the time?

03:33:13.241 --> 03:33:14.655
SAM: This is normal, it’s okay!

03:33:14.655 --> 03:33:21.667
MATT: "Not all the time. We generally do a cycle
of sunrise to about four hours past sunset. That's

03:33:21.667 --> 03:33:25.282
"our general scheme that we maintain business."

03:33:25.282 --> 03:33:29.798
TRAVIS: Pumat, we'd like to introduce you to one
of our friends. This is Beau.

03:33:29.798 --> 03:33:31.274
MARISHA: 'Sup?

03:33:31.274 --> 03:33:38.729
MATT: "Beau? Well, the pleasure is respectfully
mine." He reaches out, giant hand encompasses your

03:33:38.729 --> 03:33:39.890
entire fist.

03:33:39.890 --> 03:33:42.948
MARISHA: Little clammy.

03:33:42.948 --> 03:33:48.843
MATT: He puts the book down. Takes his glasses
off. "What can I do for you?"

03:33:48.843 --> 03:33:56.637
LAURA: Well, my mom's birthday is coming up, and
she really likes boxes that have-- Do you have a

03:33:56.637 --> 03:33:58.080
lead-lined box?

03:33:58.080 --> 03:34:04.286
MATT: "We've got quite a few here currently
containing items that require shielding."

03:34:04.349 --> 03:34:05.735
LAURA: Oh, good!

03:34:05.735 --> 03:34:06.852
MATT: "Yeah!"

03:34:06.852 --> 03:34:08.166
LAURA: Can we get one of those?

03:34:08.166 --> 03:34:16.093
MATT: "That can probably be done. How big a box
you're looking? We got them right around that

03:34:16.159 --> 03:34:21.246
"there. Then we got a bigger one about that there.
Then we got one in the back that’s a biggie."

03:34:21.246 --> 03:34:23.359
LAURA: Probably the grande. The middle.

03:34:23.425 --> 03:34:25.310
MARISHA: I was thinking the same thing!

03:34:25.310 --> 03:34:27.486
MATT: "All right. Let me go ahead and--"

03:34:27.486 --> 03:34:32.489
SAM: Wait! Mr. Pumat, what is it made of? What
does it do?

03:34:32.489 --> 03:34:38.380
MATT: "Well, what the nice lady there is
requesting is a box that is lined with the

03:34:38.380 --> 03:34:41.139
"material known as lead."

03:34:41.139 --> 03:34:45.126
SAM: I've heard of the material, but does it have
any other magical properties?

03:34:45.126 --> 03:34:51.480
MATT: "No magical properties. It’s just really
useful for poisoning yourself if you put food

03:34:51.480 --> 03:34:58.856
"storage in there, poisoning other people if you
store their food in it, and keeping at bay the

03:34:58.856 --> 03:35:02.331
"prying eyes of distant divination magics."

03:35:02.331 --> 03:35:05.620
SAM: Okay.

03:35:05.620 --> 03:35:08.288
TALIESIN: I think we’re probably going to need a
couple of healing potions as well.

03:35:08.288 --> 03:35:10.098
SAM: Yeah, to replenish.

03:35:10.098 --> 03:35:12.309
MATT: "Not a problem."

03:35:12.309 --> 03:35:14.853
TALIESIN: I’m going to window shop, then! Thank
you.

03:35:14.853 --> 03:35:20.884
TRAVIS: Pumat, we came into a little extra coin
recently and this is our favorite place to spend.

03:35:20.884 --> 03:35:28.435
You don’t happen to have any articles of
protection, do you? A necklace, a bracelet, a ring?

03:35:28.435 --> 03:35:35.615
MATT: "Well, we got this here cloak here on the
wall. I think you’ve already taken a look at it.

03:35:35.615 --> 03:35:37.947
"That’s a pretty protective--"

03:35:37.947 --> 03:35:40.043
TRAVIS: It was expensive, right?

03:35:40.043 --> 03:35:41.224
TALIESIN: It was expensive.

03:35:41.224 --> 03:35:46.324
MATT: The other one who's knitting is like, "Yeah,
it’s a pretty penny because that’s a pretty item."

03:35:46.324 --> 03:35:47.448
Goes back to knitting.

03:35:47.448 --> 03:35:49.134
LIAM: Sorry, how much precisely was that one
again?

03:35:49.134 --> 03:35:51.984
MATT: "That one will run you about 800 gold
pieces."

03:35:51.984 --> 03:35:57.604
LAURA: Still out of the reach there.

03:35:57.604 --> 03:36:01.352
LIAM and MARISHA: (singing) How much is that doggy
in the window?

03:36:01.352 --> 03:36:10.241
MATT: "We got this nice shield over here that we
just had finished a couple days ago. That's an

03:36:10.241 --> 03:36:17.247
"enchanted little delightful piece. That one is a
little more affordable at about 550 gold pieces."

03:36:17.247 --> 03:36:19.476
LAURA: What does it look like, though?

03:36:19.476 --> 03:36:27.061
MATT: The shield itself has the head of two lions,
facing away from each other, with their claws

03:36:27.061 --> 03:36:32.306
extended. It has almost a diamond shape. It's a
pretty decent size. The coloration of it is a

03:36:32.306 --> 03:36:38.627
bright gold where the lions are. The back of it is
a dull, almost graphite metallic, with a gold

03:36:38.648 --> 03:36:41.200
border around the edge of it. It’s very pretty.

03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:42.925
LAURA: What does it do?

03:36:42.925 --> 03:36:48.914
MATT: "This one? It improves your defenses more
than a normal shield would. It instinctively

03:36:48.971 --> 03:36:54.998
"places the shield in places that might help
protect from incoming blows, therefore making you

03:36:55.060 --> 03:36:56.537
"hard to connect with."

03:36:56.537 --> 03:36:58.143
LAURA: Oh. That's pretty cool.

03:36:58.143 --> 03:37:00.389
MATT: (whispers) "It's a plus one."

03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:05.518
(laughter)

03:37:05.621 --> 03:37:07.531
LAURA: How much is your fancy box?

03:37:07.627 --> 03:37:14.172
MATT: "The fancy box that you’re requesting, while
not actually enchanted, it is taking away one of

03:37:14.172 --> 03:37:20.507
"the objects that we keep contained. So,
respectfully, I'll have to charge you the cost of

03:37:20.507 --> 03:37:26.189
"that one and a replacement, but that'll simply put
you back about 15 gold pieces total."

03:37:26.255 --> 03:37:33.772
LAURA: It's probably smart, though, huh? It's probably
made a bit better.

03:37:33.836 --> 03:37:36.863
MARISHA: I'll go in on it. What was in the box
though, originally?

03:37:36.863 --> 03:37:38.956
MATT: "That is none of your concern."

03:37:38.956 --> 03:37:41.719
MARISHA: How much to make it my concern?

03:37:41.719 --> 03:37:46.712
MATT: "Your friend is a strange one."

03:37:46.712 --> 03:37:50.869
LAURA: She really is. She's always asking
questions that are weird.

03:37:50.869 --> 03:37:54.291
LIAM: She is very useful in the right
circumstances.

03:37:54.291 --> 03:37:56.829
MATT: "Oh, I can entirely understand that."

03:37:56.829 --> 03:37:58.964
MARISHA: I'm right here! I can hear you all
talking about me.

03:37:58.964 --> 03:38:00.834
LAURA: She can catch arrows out of midair.

03:38:00.834 --> 03:38:02.125
MATT: "That's really impressive."

03:38:02.125 --> 03:38:13.948
SAM: Mr. Pumat, I have another request. I know
that I had requested, would it be possible to

03:38:13.948 --> 03:38:25.298
invent a small haversack? Just the pocket thing.
But do you have any sort of magic incantation

03:38:25.363 --> 03:38:32.174
ability-- if I gave you a flask, could you make it
never run out of alcohol?

03:38:32.174 --> 03:38:37.933
MATT: "Actually, that is a very doable
enchantment. It'll take us a little while, but we

03:38:37.933 --> 03:38:40.999
"can definitely make something like that happen."

03:38:40.999 --> 03:38:44.768
SAM: How much would that R&amp;D cost me?

03:38:44.768 --> 03:38:51.164
MATT: "About a week's worth of enchanting time,
the cost will put you at about 250 gold pieces."

03:38:51.213 --> 03:38:52.314
SAM: I'll take it.

03:38:52.314 --> 03:38:54.927
(laughter)

03:38:54.927 --> 03:39:02.006
SAM: Here's my platinum flask. Could you also put
a nice little flourishy design on the side of the flask?

03:39:02.006 --> 03:39:06.458
MATT: "We can go ahead and outsource that. Yeah,
we can make that happen for you, couldn't we?" The

03:39:06.458 --> 03:39:08.676
one knitting goes, "Yeah, that's not a problem at
all."

03:39:08.676 --> 03:39:11.124
SAM: Oh wow.

03:39:11.124 --> 03:39:12.932
LAURA: That’s a lot of gold.

03:39:12.932 --> 03:39:15.499
SAM: That's nothing. It's nothing at all.

03:39:15.499 --> 03:39:19.212
MATT: "You’re going to pay up for now, up front?"

03:39:19.212 --> 03:39:20.576
SAM: Sure. Here, take it.

03:39:20.576 --> 03:39:22.165
MATT: "Oh, the whole lump sum up front!"

03:39:22.165 --> 03:39:23.344
SAM: Yep! All up front!

03:39:23.344 --> 03:39:31.014
MATT: "I appreciate your trust in our ability."
Writes up a quick little piece of paper. Hands it

03:39:31.077 --> 03:39:32.807
to you as a receipt.

03:39:32.807 --> 03:39:34.456
LAURA: We should buy that box?

03:39:34.456 --> 03:39:37.425
LIAM: We definitely should. I will buy that box
for us. How much was it?

03:39:37.486 --> 03:39:38.818
LAURA: It was 15 gold.

03:39:38.818 --> 03:39:43.687
MATT: "15 gold pieces for the box. You wanted two
healing potions? That’ll put you back about 100

03:39:43.687 --> 03:39:45.444
"gold pieces for the two."

03:39:45.444 --> 03:39:46.995
TRAVIS: That sounds fine.

03:39:46.995 --> 03:39:48.526
MARISHA: Any other healing potions you got?

03:39:48.526 --> 03:39:52.658
MATT: "We got probably another dozen or so more if
you want to buy."

03:39:52.713 --> 03:39:54.268
MARISHA: I’ll take one more as well.

03:39:54.268 --> 03:39:55.547
TRAVIS: Here’s ten platinum.

03:39:55.547 --> 03:40:00.690
MATT: "Ten whole platinum. All right there. 50
gold from each of you. That’s a healing potion to

03:40:00.690 --> 03:40:01.976
"each of you."

03:40:01.976 --> 03:40:11.601
LIAM: Also, I assume it is out of my reach
price-wise, and I'm on a budget, but do you deal

03:40:11.601 --> 03:40:19.028
in arcane knowledge? Pre-prepared scrolls of any
kind?

03:40:19.028 --> 03:40:26.692
MATT: "Yeah. We have certainly many number of
various scrolls and scroll types and spells. If

03:40:26.692 --> 03:40:29.224
"that's what you're looking for, we can definitely
provide."

03:40:29.224 --> 03:40:33.916
LIAM: What is the range? What are your lowest
rung, I guess I'm curious to know.

03:40:33.916 --> 03:40:41.911
MATT: "I'm going to go ahead and double-check
here." He goes through his ledger. "Let's see. The

03:40:41.911 --> 03:40:48.634
"very basic ones, whether that be cantrips or
1st-level spellcasting, those are fairly common.

03:40:48.634 --> 03:40:51.828
"Those will put you back about 50 to 100 gold,
approximately."

03:40:51.828 --> 03:40:56.916
LIAM: DM, a question from Liam. Can cantrips be
added if they're found?

03:40:56.916 --> 03:40:58.705
MATT: I imagine they could.

03:40:58.705 --> 03:40:59.815
LIAM: Okay.

03:40:59.815 --> 03:41:02.460
TALIESIN: Greater healing potion, yeah?

03:41:02.460 --> 03:41:08.533
MATT: No, it's a regular healing potion. Regular
heal. "If you're going up from there to 2nd- or

03:41:08.533 --> 03:41:16.523
"3rd-level, those'll put you back probably closer
to maybe 250-500 gold, depending, and then it

03:41:16.523 --> 03:41:18.568
"skyrockets from there."

03:41:18.568 --> 03:41:23.678
LIAM: You know, I am interested in everything from
the second level and below. Do you have a menu?

03:41:23.678 --> 03:41:32.225
MATT: "I mean, we have to order them from the
Academy, but we can get them in here for you. Or

03:41:32.225 --> 03:41:34.152
"the Halls of Erudition."

03:41:34.221 --> 03:41:37.293
LIAM: Give me a moment. Player's Handbook!

03:41:37.293 --> 03:41:42.228
MARISHA: Taliesin, are you seeing-- wait, no. Are
you seeing the potion of healing?

03:41:42.228 --> 03:41:45.123
SAM: Go to your D&amp;D Beyond app; it has all the
manuals.

03:41:45.123 --> 03:41:47.985
TALIESIN: Potion of healing.

03:41:47.985 --> 03:41:50.487
MARISHA: I'm only seeing the greaters.

03:41:50.487 --> 03:41:59.757
TALIESIN: Careful if you’re filtering by type. I
was having a problem with that. It's "potion of

03:41:59.757 --> 03:42:01.080
"healing."

03:42:01.080 --> 03:42:03.673
LAURA: We should probably get back and put the
thing in this box, though.

03:42:03.673 --> 03:42:07.306
MATT: The box is presented, you pay for that, 15
gold.

03:42:07.306 --> 03:42:17.948
TALIESIN: It's black. It's not green, blue, or
purple. It's black text. It took me a second to

03:42:17.948 --> 03:42:19.152
realize.

03:42:19.152 --> 03:42:22.097
SAM: Maybe you should cancel the order. Have him
make something else.

03:42:22.097 --> 03:42:23.675
LAURA: What should we have him make?

03:42:23.675 --> 03:42:24.738
SAM: A flask.

03:42:24.738 --> 03:42:33.168
MATT: A lead flask. It's weird, every level the
intelligence gets lower.

03:42:33.168 --> 03:42:39.380
TRAVIS: Well, should we go?

03:42:39.380 --> 03:42:41.454
LIAM: Hold your horses.

03:42:41.454 --> 03:42:42.883
TRAVIS: Oh, we're looking up something.

03:42:42.883 --> 03:42:46.272
MATT: While this is happening, Pumat picks up the
book again and puts the glasses on, and starts

03:42:46.272 --> 03:42:47.391
continuing to read.

03:42:47.391 --> 03:42:49.220
TALIESIN: I was doing a look around to see if
there was anything new.

03:42:49.220 --> 03:42:50.776
SAM: Did we get any healing potions?

03:42:50.776 --> 03:42:52.270
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:42:52.270 --> 03:42:53.603
MARISHA: I got one.

03:42:53.603 --> 03:42:55.107
SAM: Do you need any more, Caleb?

03:42:55.107 --> 03:42:57.105
LIAM: No, I am very good, thank you.

03:42:57.105 --> 03:42:58.704
LAURA: I'll buy a healing potion.

03:42:58.704 --> 03:42:59.770
TALIESIN: 12.

03:42:59.770 --> 03:43:03.597
MATT: Right, so another 50 off you. 12, nothing at
the moment. It's only been a few days, and the

03:43:03.597 --> 03:43:09.106
enchantment process and/or the coming in of new
objects can take a while to stock back up. The

03:43:09.106 --> 03:43:15.640
shield is the most recent creation that was
presented. That's the only new one you see. Other

03:43:15.640 --> 03:43:24.379
than that, there's still the pearl, there's still
the cloak. A few other odds and small wands.

03:43:24.379 --> 03:43:27.696
TALIESIN: The cloak was the most exciting thing.

03:43:27.696 --> 03:43:35.206
TRAVIS: Forgive me, I couldn't help but wonder.
Have you ever had a chance-- Pumat Prime, rather--

03:43:35.206 --> 03:43:37.464
have you had a chance to exercise your arcane
abilities?

03:43:37.464 --> 03:43:40.061
MATT: "Oh, if you want Pumat Prime, he's in the
back. I can go get him for you."

03:43:40.061 --> 03:43:42.317
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you wouldn't mind.

03:43:42.317 --> 03:43:48.859
MATT: "All right." He puts the book down on the
counter, glasses off, turns around, leaves. Comes

03:43:48.859 --> 03:43:52.513
back in, takes the glasses, puts them on, takes
the book, and continues reading, while Pumat Prime

03:43:52.513 --> 03:43:59.678
comes from the back, once again, the large set of
goggle glasses on, the apron on. "I was told that

03:43:59.678 --> 03:44:03.123
"I was requested to greet you with a 'hello!'"

03:44:03.123 --> 03:44:04.655
MARISHA: What is happening?

03:44:04.655 --> 03:44:08.732
TRAVIS: These are all-- What's the correct term?

03:44:08.732 --> 03:44:10.077
LAURA: Sicrulalium?

03:44:10.077 --> 03:44:14.787
MATT: "Simulacrum. That's the one, yeah. I know,
it's a little confusing."

03:44:14.787 --> 03:44:22.329
TRAVIS: They're all copies of this fine gentleman.
Pumat, I wanted to ask, we're such fans of your

03:44:22.329 --> 03:44:30.501
store, did you ever find call to, I don't know,
use your magic for combat? What led you to a store

03:44:30.501 --> 03:44:32.036
like this?

03:44:32.036 --> 03:44:45.336
MATT: "That's kind of a personal story. Let's just
say I didn't get along with my peers at a young

03:44:45.336 --> 03:44:57.652
"age, and found myself wandering. Got picked up by
some nice mages that saw some potential. Took me

03:44:57.652 --> 03:45:02.223
"in and helped me hone my craft, and helped me set
up a store, and here I am in Zadash."

03:45:02.223 --> 03:45:05.712
TRAVIS: That's great. How many years have you had
this store?

03:45:05.712 --> 03:45:08.464
MATT: "Been running this place for a good 12
years."

03:45:08.464 --> 03:45:11.988
TRAVIS: Congratulations. It's really a thing.

03:45:11.988 --> 03:45:14.061
MATT: "Thank you."

03:45:14.061 --> 03:45:22.107
LAURA: What mages were you with? What mages found
you? Were they with the Academy?

03:45:22.107 --> 03:45:25.955
MATT: "Sort of. They were with the Cerberus
Assembly."

03:45:25.955 --> 03:45:28.715
LAURA: That's right, you were talking about them
before.

03:45:28.715 --> 03:45:34.132
MATT: "Yeah. They really--" Oh no.

03:45:34.132 --> 03:45:36.740
SAM: It gets caught in the corners.

03:45:36.740 --> 03:45:39.209
TRAVIS: Shake it out of the corners of the giant
flask.

03:45:39.209 --> 03:45:40.542
LIAM: Oh no!

03:45:40.542 --> 03:45:43.959
MARISHA: What is hiding in those corners, though?

03:45:43.959 --> 03:45:46.244
SAM: Good stuff.

03:45:46.244 --> 03:45:54.430
MATT: "The main person who's been of aid to me is
the Headmaster Oremid Hass, who runs the Hall of

03:45:54.430 --> 03:45:55.674
"Erudition."

03:45:55.674 --> 03:46:02.213
SAM: We still haven't gone there, have we? We've
heard about it, like, seven times!

03:46:02.302 --> 03:46:04.263
MARISHA: He runs the Hall of Erudition?

03:46:04.263 --> 03:46:09.820
MATT: "He's the Headmaster of the Hall." He
scratches his chin for a second. "He's the

03:46:09.820 --> 03:46:19.146
"Archmage of Cultivation within the Cerberus
Assembly. He's been a real nice beacon of

03:46:19.146 --> 03:46:28.165
"tutelage. He's a bit rough on the edges, and seems
tough, but he's a softie. Especially when it comes

03:46:28.165 --> 03:46:35.514
"to small critters. Don't tell him I said that."
For that one moment, you see a look of fear in his eyes.

03:46:35.514 --> 03:46:37.362
TRAVIS and LIAM: Small critters.

03:46:37.362 --> 03:46:41.325
SAM: Wait, he likes small critters? Like me?

03:46:41.325 --> 03:46:47.916
MATT: "Maybe? I don't know. Anyway, I got to get
back to work." He quickly goes into the back room again.

03:46:47.916 --> 03:46:49.456
TRAVIS: Thanks for your time, Pumat!

03:46:49.456 --> 03:46:56.069
MATT: "Don't mention it!" The one that's reading
off to the sides goes--

03:46:56.069 --> 03:46:57.624
SAM: He's cool, right?

03:46:57.624 --> 03:46:58.883
MARISHA: That guy's crazy!

03:46:58.883 --> 03:47:00.861
TRAVIS: He's actually still here.

03:47:00.861 --> 03:47:02.312
MARISHA: Gah!

03:47:02.312 --> 03:47:12.488
LIAM: Let's get back to business. I don't know
what you have on tap here, but I'm looking for

03:47:12.488 --> 03:47:18.978
something, just a cantrip, pretty common,
shocking--

03:47:18.978 --> 03:47:23.058
MATT: "Shocking Grasp. I know what you're talking
about."

03:47:23.058 --> 03:47:24.552
LIAM: You know how it works?

03:47:24.552 --> 03:47:28.008
MATT: "I got it myself. Anyone want to see?"

03:47:28.008 --> 03:47:29.103
TRAVIS: I would like it.

03:47:29.103 --> 03:47:30.216
LAURA: Okay!

03:47:30.216 --> 03:47:31.663
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:47:31.663 --> 03:47:36.312
MATT: "All righty. I like the gumption." He goes
and gives a big old handshake to Beauregard. Let

03:47:36.312 --> 03:47:38.389
me look that up real fast.

03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:41.454
MARISHA: I don't know what I'm agreeing to.

03:47:41.454 --> 03:47:50.297
MATT: It's an auto-hit, because you're reaching
out to it. You immediately grab his giant mitt,

03:47:50.297 --> 03:47:58.022
and a flash of white light and pain as electricity
rocks through your body. You take three points of

03:47:58.022 --> 03:47:59.131
lightning damage.

03:47:59.131 --> 03:48:00.356
MARISHA: (yelps) Fuck!

03:48:00.356 --> 03:48:01.813
LIAM: That is the one.

03:48:01.813 --> 03:48:03.027
MARISHA: Get that!

03:48:03.027 --> 03:48:08.873
MATT: "That one will run you 75 gold pieces."

03:48:08.873 --> 03:48:12.456
LIAM: Excellent. Pause. The other thing--

03:48:12.456 --> 03:48:15.795
MATT: "Hands. They look paws-ish, but yeah."

03:48:15.795 --> 03:48:21.148
LIAM: The other one that I am interested in that
is not really my forte, but many wizards believe

03:48:21.148 --> 03:48:24.793
it is of great benefit. Do you have the Shield
spell?

03:48:24.793 --> 03:48:30.531
MATT: "We can get you a Shield spell. That's a
pretty standard defensive mechanism for those of

03:48:30.531 --> 03:48:32.240
"the arcane persuasion."

03:48:32.240 --> 03:48:34.553
LIAM: How much will that run me?

03:48:34.553 --> 03:48:39.974
MATT: He thumbs through the ledger. "That one will
cost you about 200 gold pieces."

03:48:39.974 --> 03:48:42.688
LIAM: I will take the pair.

03:48:42.688 --> 03:48:45.825
MATT: "All righty there."

03:48:45.825 --> 03:48:46.852
SAM: What was the first one?

03:48:46.852 --> 03:48:48.120
LAURA: Shocking Grasp.

03:48:48.120 --> 03:48:49.595
SAM: We'll be twinsies.

03:48:49.595 --> 03:48:58.126
MATT: "275 gold pieces." He sets his book back
down, puts his glasses down, leaves the room for a

03:48:58.126 --> 03:49:02.824
second, and is gone for about a minute or so.
Comes back with two scrolls and sets them on the

03:49:02.824 --> 03:49:03.975
table.

03:49:03.975 --> 03:49:08.147
LIAM: I will take those. Thank you very much,
<i>Herr</i> Sol.

03:49:08.147 --> 03:49:09.710
MATT: "My pleasure."

03:49:09.710 --> 03:49:12.395
LAURA: Did you just call him "asshole?"

03:49:12.395 --> 03:49:16.350
LIAM: That is <i>Arschloch,</i> so no.

03:49:16.350 --> 03:49:18.038
SAM: Wait a minute, what does that mean?

03:49:18.038 --> 03:49:19.211
LIAM: Which?

03:49:19.211 --> 03:49:20.404
SAM: Nothing.

03:49:20.404 --> 03:49:23.402
LIAM: Who's on first?

03:49:23.402 --> 03:49:26.269
LAURA: Should we go?

03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:30.106
TRAVIS: Let's get that thing in its box.

03:49:30.106 --> 03:49:33.843
MATT: "Anything else you guys require, or can you
leave me to my reading?"

03:49:33.843 --> 03:49:36.126
SAM: Whatcha reading?

03:49:36.126 --> 03:49:40.846
MATT: "It's a collection of crazy tales about this
weird fella."

03:49:40.846 --> 03:49:42.435
LAURA: What guy?

03:49:42.435 --> 03:49:51.957
MATT: "It's The Daring Trials and Tribulations of
Sir Taryon Darrington. This guy's been all over

03:49:51.957 --> 03:49:53.669
"the place. It's kind of wild."

03:49:53.669 --> 03:49:57.352
(laughter)

03:49:57.352 --> 03:50:00.205
TALIESIN: Wow. Ten episodes.

03:50:00.205 --> 03:50:01.309
LIAM: Fiction, or...?

03:50:01.309 --> 03:50:04.708
MATT: Oh, it's got to be fiction. (laughter) But
it's good fiction!

03:50:04.708 --> 03:50:06.409
TRAVIS: Are you fucking kidding me?

03:50:06.409 --> 03:50:12.086
LIAM: Well, sum it up for me. Give me the Tenser's
Floating Disk pitch.

03:50:12.086 --> 03:50:13.445
LAURA: No!

03:50:13.445 --> 03:50:18.678
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

03:50:18.678 --> 03:50:28.607
MATT: Well, let me finish my book before I tell
you too much about it. Needless to say, he's got

03:50:28.607 --> 03:50:40.017
this wild construct-looking friend called Dottie.
And apparently, according to this thing, there's

03:50:40.017 --> 03:50:45.023
these powerful folks from over there in Tal'Dorei
that he's been meeting up with that keep messing

03:50:45.023 --> 03:50:48.978
up every time they go on an adventure! Real thorns
in his side!

03:50:48.978 --> 03:50:57.120
LIAM: We can relate. I'm a big reader. If you
finish that, I don't know if you are the kind of

03:50:57.120 --> 03:50:59.465
fellow who likes to keep every book he reads
but--

03:50:59.465 --> 03:51:01.045
MATT: I got a collection.

03:51:01.045 --> 03:51:04.245
LIAM: Oh, <i>ja</i>, that makes sense. Okay. Well, I
will look for it elsewhere, thank you.

03:51:04.245 --> 03:51:08.403
MATT: Sure, I got this shipped out to me from
Deastok. Perhaps if you are in that vicinity, see

03:51:08.403 --> 03:51:09.984
that you get yourself a copy.

03:51:09.984 --> 03:51:11.126
LIAM: Oh, okay.

03:51:11.126 --> 03:51:12.960
TRAVIS: Bestseller or used book?

03:51:12.960 --> 03:51:16.826
MATT: I had never heard of it until this, so
probably not that easy to find.

03:51:16.826 --> 03:51:19.770
LIAM: Would you be able to put in an order for
this book for me?

03:51:19.770 --> 03:51:24.047
MATT: I mean, I'm not really a book retailer.

03:51:24.047 --> 03:51:29.857
LIAM: I understand, but you know many people. You
are obviously a very knowledgeable fellow who has

03:51:29.857 --> 03:51:31.497
vast connections.

03:51:31.497 --> 03:51:34.039
MARISHA: I bet we could go back to the Chastity's
Nook for that.

03:51:34.039 --> 03:51:35.457
SAM: They will probably have it.

03:51:35.457 --> 03:51:37.057
MATT: That is probably a place to look for a
book.

03:51:37.057 --> 03:51:38.583
LAURA: It sounds like smut to me.

03:51:38.583 --> 03:51:39.685
LIAM: It's a dirty book?

03:51:39.685 --> 03:51:40.986
MATT: Not yet.

03:51:40.986 --> 03:51:43.946
LIAM: All right. Well, I wait for your full
review. Thank you.

03:51:43.946 --> 03:51:45.084
LAURA: You just wait.

03:51:45.084 --> 03:51:46.044
MATT: All right.

03:51:46.044 --> 03:51:47.735
MARISHA: It's called "The Daring Tales."

03:51:47.735 --> 03:51:50.715
SAM: Sounds like shite, Caleb. There are much
better books out there.

03:51:50.715 --> 03:51:55.373
LAURA: Let's go. Come on, there are things that
need to be taken care of, Caleb!

03:51:55.373 --> 03:51:58.380
LIAM: True. I got distracted. You know.

03:51:58.595 --> 03:52:02.952
TRAVIS: Pumat, thanks for your time. We will not
be bothering you any longer.

03:52:02.952 --> 03:52:05.444
LAURA: But we will be back because we like you so
much!

03:52:05.444 --> 03:52:10.313
MATT: You are always welcome any time! All of us
are happy to see you come in and spend your

03:52:10.313 --> 03:52:11.604
hard-earned money.

03:52:11.604 --> 03:52:12.644
LAURA: Thank you.

03:52:12.644 --> 03:52:13.443
SAM: Goodbye.

03:52:13.443 --> 03:52:16.230
MATT: "Goodbye!" "Goodbye!" "Goodbye!" A little
hand comes out from the curtain in the back.

03:52:16.230 --> 03:52:17.404
"Bye-bye!"

03:52:17.404 --> 03:52:21.971
LAURA: Let's go! Come on, we've got to get back
to the Tap!

03:52:22.198 --> 03:52:25.688
TRAVIS: We double dash back to the Tap.

03:52:25.688 --> 03:52:28.352
SAM: To the Tap? Why are we going there now? Oh,
to the box thing!

03:52:28.352 --> 03:52:31.058
LAURA: Yeah, and to look at the stuff Caleb
identified for us.

03:52:31.058 --> 03:52:34.537
MATT: All right, so you guys return. Do you head
down to the basement?

03:52:34.537 --> 03:52:35.450
LAURA: Yeah!

03:52:35.450 --> 03:52:36.487
MARISHA: I make sure it's still there.

03:52:36.544 --> 03:52:37.549
MATT: It's still there.

03:52:37.549 --> 03:52:38.925
LAURA: Let's put it in the thing!

03:52:38.925 --> 03:52:42.993
LIAM: So I put the box right down next to me and I
put my coat--

03:52:42.993 --> 03:52:44.781
SAM: Is the skeleton alive?

03:52:44.781 --> 03:52:46.372
MATT: No, the skeleton is still dead.

03:52:46.372 --> 03:52:49.708
MARISHA: He didn't bring anything back to life,
that's good.

03:52:49.708 --> 03:52:56.941
LIAM: Okay. So, this is better than it was before.
You have monster calves, do you want to carry this now?

03:52:56.941 --> 03:52:59.544
LAURA: What, like, on me all the time?

03:52:59.544 --> 03:53:01.456
LIAM: I am--

03:53:01.456 --> 03:53:08.800
MATT: As he's holding it, placing it over the
box, there's still that undulating low hum and

03:53:08.851 --> 03:53:10.210
grayish glow--

03:53:10.210 --> 03:53:11.798
LAURA: I mean, I can carry this box with me all
the time, but don't you think it's weird to carry

03:53:11.798 --> 03:53:13.180
around a box all the time?

03:53:13.180 --> 03:53:14.267
TRAVIS: No.

03:53:14.267 --> 03:53:15.963
LIAM: No, people carry boxes.

03:53:15.963 --> 03:53:17.518
SAM: Can we put the box in the--?

03:53:17.518 --> 03:53:18.342
TALIESIN: The bag?

03:53:18.342 --> 03:53:19.738
SAM: Oh wait, we can't put the box in the bag.

03:53:19.738 --> 03:53:20.812
TRAVIS: Why?

03:53:20.812 --> 03:53:22.708
SAM: Crossing the streams.

03:53:22.708 --> 03:53:28.781
MARISHA: But now we can put the dodecah-shit-ball
in the box and now the box in the bag, right?

03:53:28.781 --> 03:53:30.143
MATT: Make an arcana check.

03:53:30.143 --> 03:53:31.028
SAM: Still crossing the streams.

03:53:31.028 --> 03:53:31.997
MARISHA: Still crossing the streams?

03:53:31.997 --> 03:53:36.092
LIAM: The lead is just to protect this item from
divination.

03:53:36.092 --> 03:53:38.540
TRAVIS: 22. Plus four.

03:53:38.540 --> 03:53:43.586
LIAM: I am worried about crossing two planes of
existence. It might not be that at all, but it is

03:53:43.586 --> 03:53:44.971
definitely not worth chancing.

03:53:44.971 --> 03:53:50.786
MATT: The essence, as you're looking at this and
concentrating on this object, trying to get a

03:53:50.840 --> 03:53:58.973
grasp on it now that you have a good moment to
look at it. The school of magic, or whatever the

03:53:58.973 --> 03:54:05.579
source of the magic is here, escapes you. It seems
almost beyond or separate than some of the magics

03:54:05.579 --> 03:54:10.768
that you've naturally learned through your
acquisition of spells and the pact that you had

03:54:10.838 --> 03:54:25.766
made. But you don't get the sense that it's
extraplanar or anything that would constitute the

03:54:25.834 --> 03:54:29.690
same level of danger that you think Caleb is
focused on.

03:54:29.690 --> 03:54:32.913
LIAM: Tell me.

03:54:32.913 --> 03:54:34.100
TRAVIS: Yeah, I say that.

03:54:34.100 --> 03:54:41.353
LIAM: What, you have experience with things of
this nature?

03:54:41.353 --> 03:54:48.080
TRAVIS: It seems like a different sort of arcana
than the type that I've seen.

03:54:48.080 --> 03:54:53.184
LIAM: Okay, well, that's fine. I'm going to walk
about 200 feet away from you when you put it in

03:54:53.247 --> 03:54:54.538
that bag--

03:54:54.698 --> 03:54:56.112
LAURA: I put it in the bag.

03:54:56.112 --> 03:54:59.291
(laughter)

03:54:59.291 --> 03:55:04.692
MATT: Okay! I need you all to roll-- no, I’m
kidding.

03:55:04.692 --> 03:55:07.523
(laughter)

03:55:07.523 --> 03:55:17.206
MATT: Well, that's a TPK. You plop it in the bag
and it vanishes inside the pouch.

03:55:17.206 --> 03:55:21.163
LAURA: How long does it take to take effect if we're
all going to die?

03:55:21.222 --> 03:55:23.359
LIAM: It takes about two weeks, so I guess we’ll
find out.

03:55:23.359 --> 03:55:26.280
LAURA: Eventually! I put my bag back on.

03:55:26.280 --> 03:55:29.087
TRAVIS: What else we got?

03:55:29.087 --> 03:55:31.806
LIAM: Oh yes, very good things.

03:55:31.806 --> 03:55:33.092
SAM: Yes, the items!

03:55:33.092 --> 03:55:36.001
LIAM: The daggers are just daggers, okay.

03:55:36.001 --> 03:55:37.062
SAM: I'll take those.

03:55:37.062 --> 03:55:43.695
LIAM: Who cares about daggers, honestly? But
this-- I hold up this longsword which I can barely

03:55:43.747 --> 03:55:52.289
hold up. This would be good for either of you two.
I will let you decide. Fjord, here. This is a very

03:55:52.289 --> 03:56:00.031
strong sword; it is very good against creatures.
That is for you to look at. Then these boots would

03:56:00.031 --> 03:56:09.232
make anyone better, but I think that Beauregard
might benefit from them the most. I could be

03:56:09.232 --> 03:56:13.470
wrong; I'm going to give them to Beau and let you
decide.

03:56:13.470 --> 03:56:15.030
MARISHA: All right, all right.

03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:18.044
LAURA: What is it? What are they? What do they
do?

03:56:18.044 --> 03:56:25.041
MATT: The downside is longswords are not
finesse weapons, so you'd have to use strength

03:56:25.091 --> 03:56:26.500
to utilize it.

03:56:26.500 --> 03:56:28.806
TRAVIS: That's pretty dope.

03:56:28.806 --> 03:56:29.888
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:56:29.939 --> 03:56:31.318
TRAVIS: Pretty dope.

03:56:31.318 --> 03:56:33.840
TALIESIN: This is really bloody heavy.

03:56:33.840 --> 03:56:35.206
LAURA: Is it--

03:56:35.206 --> 03:56:37.297
TALIESIN: You could actually--

03:56:37.297 --> 03:56:40.809
LAURA: Could I use that? A longsword?

03:56:40.864 --> 03:56:47.470
MATT: Yeah, well, are you proficient with weapons
like a longsword? Your weapon proficiencies? My

03:56:47.470 --> 03:56:49.159
Player's Handbook keeps disappearing from me.

03:56:49.159 --> 03:56:50.945
SAM: Why do we only have one?

03:56:50.945 --> 03:56:52.843
LIAM: There's another one, it's just gone
missing.

03:56:52.908 --> 03:56:54.857
TALIESIN: I know someone who might really enjoy
this if you don't want it.

03:56:54.857 --> 03:56:57.226
MARISHA: We have like 30 Handbooks around here
somewhere.

03:56:57.226 --> 03:57:00.917
TALIESIN: We took them all outside and they stayed
there.

03:57:00.917 --> 03:57:03.962
LAURA: Did I put that down? I might have written
my proficiencies--

03:57:03.962 --> 03:57:05.523
SAM: How many weapons can you wield?

03:57:05.523 --> 03:57:06.503
LAURA: Simple weapons!

03:57:06.503 --> 03:57:07.657
MATT: Yeah, so you could not use a longsword.

03:57:07.657 --> 03:57:11.047
TALIESIN: I think I know somebody who could really
enjoy this, and I'll hold on to it for a friend.

03:57:11.100 --> 03:57:13.654
LAURA: Could Yasha use that?

03:57:13.654 --> 03:57:15.508
TALIESIN: I think Yasha might get a kick out of
it.

03:57:15.508 --> 03:57:16.938
LAURA: Oh! That’s great!

03:57:16.938 --> 03:57:19.463
MARISHA: Wait, is she still a thing? She's going
to come back?

03:57:19.463 --> 03:57:20.752
SAM: Gone forever!

03:57:20.752 --> 03:57:23.544
TALIESIN: I've known Yasha a long time, she makes her
way back around.

03:57:23.633 --> 03:57:26.697
TRAVIS: Although that greatsword she has is
mighty fine.

03:57:26.752 --> 03:57:31.328
LIAM: I mean, we will probably never see her
again, that seems a little foolish to me.

03:57:31.328 --> 03:57:35.958
LAURA: I hope she's still in the city, because
otherwise she's going to have a really hard time

03:57:36.010 --> 03:57:37.532
trying to get back in.

03:57:37.532 --> 03:57:38.987
TALIESIN: We'll eventually need a bath and we'll
find her again.

03:57:39.037 --> 03:57:41.784
LIAM: Could one of us carry it until she returns?
Who could really use it?

03:57:41.848 --> 03:57:44.743
LAURA: I don't think anyone can use it.

03:57:44.743 --> 03:57:47.457
LIAM: Not you? You are so good with a sword!

03:57:47.511 --> 03:57:53.825
TRAVIS: Yeah, certainly. I just have a preference with
mine. I'm just real comfortable with it. You know

03:57:53.901 --> 03:57:56.245
when you get a feel for something, you don't want
to change it up too much.

03:57:56.316 --> 03:57:57.483
TALIESIN: It’s worth holding onto.

03:57:57.483 --> 03:57:58.625
LIAM: Of course, yes.

03:57:58.625 --> 03:58:03.182
MARISHA: I respect her ability to handle her own
shit on her own time.

03:58:03.182 --> 03:58:04.857
LAURA: What do the boots do?

03:58:04.857 --> 03:58:08.723
MARISHA: They’re pretty great! So I strap on the
big, gothy boots--

03:58:08.723 --> 03:58:12.701
TRAVIS: Big-ass tall Doc Martens.

03:58:12.713 --> 03:58:17.645
MARISHA: Super tall Doc Martens, lots of little
fur-lined, lots of straps and zippers.

03:58:17.645 --> 03:58:28.338
MATT: These boots are designed in a similar style
as to the armor of the Xhorhasian individual you

03:58:28.338 --> 03:58:29.314
had fought.

03:58:29.314 --> 03:58:30.550
LAURA: Is it kind of obvious?

03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:36.130
MATT: No, not obvious. They’re made of a very dark
brown or black leather with studs and the tops of

03:58:36.130 --> 03:58:40.536
them curl up into two spikes at the tip at each
side.

03:58:40.536 --> 03:58:42.229
MARISHA: How do they look?

03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:47.510
LAURA: Well, normally you're barefoot so it looks
pretty good. It makes your pants billow a little

03:58:47.530 --> 03:58:49.480
weird but I like it.

03:58:49.480 --> 03:58:52.818
MARISHA: Yeah, it’s hard to tuck your pants into
your boots.

03:58:52.818 --> 03:58:56.550
LIAM: I thought you would like those. Was I right?
I was right, wasn't I?

03:58:56.550 --> 03:59:00.618
MARISHA: They're pretty great. They add 1d8 to my
initiative roll.

03:59:00.645 --> 03:59:06.102
LIAM: Once per day. So you can choose a moment 
to get the jump.

03:59:06.159 --> 03:59:09.901
MARISHA: Does anyone else feel like they might
benefit from these more than me?

03:59:09.966 --> 03:59:11.507
LIAM: I mean, anybody would, but--

03:59:11.507 --> 03:59:13.471
TALIESIN: I think I’m pretty good with this.

03:59:13.471 --> 03:59:16.517
TRAVIS: My initiative bonus is zero, just saying.
(exaggerated cough) No, you keep them.

03:59:16.517 --> 03:59:18.504
MARISHA: Your initiative bonus is zero?

03:59:18.504 --> 03:59:24.490
LIAM: Yeah, but you know Beauregard really is the
most capable fighter in this group, at this moment

03:59:24.490 --> 03:59:28.832
in time. What? That’s just the truth. Can you
handle the truth?

03:59:28.832 --> 03:59:31.357
LAURA: Can <i>you</i> handle the truth?

03:59:31.357 --> 03:59:37.850
MARISHA: I feel like Nott might be able to do some
good with these too, if she had them.

03:59:37.850 --> 03:59:44.706
SAM: I defer to the wisdom of the group. We merely
follow your expert wisdom.

03:59:44.706 --> 03:59:48.102
MARISHA: Okay, I’m sensing some passive
aggressive--

03:59:48.102 --> 03:59:49.980
SAM: No! I am sincere!

03:59:49.980 --> 03:59:52.937
TRAVIS: (whispering) Just smile and say, "Thank
you, Nott."

03:59:52.937 --> 03:59:56.380
MARISHA: Thank you, Nott.

03:59:56.380 --> 03:59:57.893
TRAVIS: (whispering) Very good.

03:59:57.893 --> 04:00:01.872
MARISHA: Very good. Thank you. Thank you, Nott.

04:00:01.872 --> 04:00:03.742
SAM: What is that crazy expression?!

04:00:03.807 --> 04:00:05.656
(laughter)

04:00:05.656 --> 04:00:10.975
SAM: I saw your gums for a second. It was freaky.

04:00:10.975 --> 04:00:14.796
MARISHA: Don't patronize me, Nott.

04:00:14.796 --> 04:00:19.547
LAURA: Ooh, I take out the Wand of Smiles and I
cast it at her.

04:00:19.547 --> 04:00:22.169
MATT: Well, you have to make a saving throw.

04:00:22.169 --> 04:00:23.165
MARISHA: Oh, do I?

04:00:23.165 --> 04:00:24.287
SAM: I forgot we had that.

04:00:24.287 --> 04:00:25.857
MARISHA: What kind of a saving throw?

04:00:25.857 --> 04:00:26.930
MATT: Is it a wisdom saving throw?

04:00:26.930 --> 04:00:27.628
LAURA: Charisma.

04:00:27.628 --> 04:00:31.968
MARISHA: Oh, that's not good for me. Nope,
definitely not.

04:00:32.157 --> 04:00:35.972
MATT: Yep, for the next minute, your face is
curled up into a Joker-like smile.

04:00:35.972 --> 04:00:39.297
LIAM: Oh, I love making people happy.

04:00:39.297 --> 04:00:41.930
LAURA: Now you look so happy! It's so wonderful!

04:00:41.930 --> 04:00:43.292
MARISHA: (voice cracking) I am so happy!

04:00:43.292 --> 04:00:48.019
TRAVIS: So we should-- ugh, just look at them!

04:00:48.019 --> 04:00:49.142
TALIESIN: Ugh!

04:00:49.142 --> 04:00:53.817
TRAVIS: We should probably do something. We still
have to wrap up this deception of ours.

04:00:53.817 --> 04:00:57.305
LAURA: Oh, right. What are we supposed to do now?

04:00:57.305 --> 04:01:00.190
MARISHA: (brightly) Go talk to the Gentleman, of
course.

04:01:00.190 --> 04:01:02.056
LAURA: But wait--

04:01:02.056 --> 04:01:05.486
TRAVIS: You sound like The General car insurance.

04:01:05.486 --> 04:01:10.493
MARISHA: (singing) 1-800-General!

04:01:10.493 --> 04:01:12.237
LAURA: What does The General have to do with--

04:01:12.237 --> 04:01:13.602
SAM: The Gentleman.

04:01:13.602 --> 04:01:17.861
LAURA: What does the Gentleman have to do with
this plan, though?

04:01:17.911 --> 04:01:23.151
SAM: We were going to investigate Kara, who was
going to the bar that the Gentleman frequents.

04:01:23.151 --> 04:01:28.385
LAURA: Oh, that's what it was. Okay, so we go to
the Evening Nip to investigate her, and then we

04:01:28.385 --> 04:01:30.272
just happen to talk to the Gentleman, too?

04:01:30.272 --> 04:01:32.012
SAM: If it happens, if it comes up.

04:01:32.012 --> 04:01:40.810
LIAM: But also, we did not get the full catch-up,
Fjord. What about the remnants of-- I know

04:01:40.810 --> 04:01:47.990
everything is <i>verkakte</i>. The High-Richter is
dead, that's half the job done in a way we did not

04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:53.566
predict, but what about Lord Sutan? Did you talk
to Dolan? And are they going to get the

04:01:53.566 --> 04:01:54.742
Crownsguard in there?

04:01:54.742 --> 04:01:58.588
SAM: Oh yeah, we have to send the guards to find
the evidence! Oh god!

04:01:58.588 --> 04:02:01.125
LIAM: We can't do anything. Dolan was going to
handle that part of this.

04:02:01.125 --> 04:02:05.388
MARISHA: I feel like it's all gone to shit.

04:02:05.388 --> 04:02:08.836
TRAVIS: Yeah. I think that's right, actually. I
forgot that part.

04:02:08.836 --> 04:02:11.545
LAURA: I wonder if it's all a distraction, though,
for the big stuff.

04:02:11.545 --> 04:02:13.207
MARISHA: I think that's exactly what this is.

04:02:13.207 --> 04:02:15.827
TALIESIN: I'm wondering if the guards are already
there looking at the mysterious explosion that

04:02:15.827 --> 04:02:17.550
happened in that house.

04:02:17.550 --> 04:02:21.850
LAURA: Well, that was the High-Richter's house.
But Lord Sutan probably went home and noticed his

04:02:21.850 --> 04:02:23.336
rug was missing.

04:02:23.336 --> 04:02:26.601
LIAM: Absolutely noticed that the very expensive
magical rug is gone!

04:02:26.601 --> 04:02:30.844
LAURA: And so did he go to the guards, or did he
go, "Oh shit, I was hiding something?"

04:02:30.844 --> 04:02:33.016
TRAVIS: Did we plant something in Lord Sutan's
house, are they going to find the letter from--

04:02:33.016 --> 04:02:35.333
SAM: And we stole a seal.

04:02:35.333 --> 04:02:43.918
LIAM: Listen, this could all appear like the
Knights turned on the High-Richter. I thought we

04:02:43.918 --> 04:02:45.216
wanted to get rid of Lord Sutan?

04:02:45.386 --> 04:02:46.448
TRAVIS: We did.

04:02:46.448 --> 04:02:50.371
LAURA: Yes, but we put evidence in his house. So
if he noticed that the rug was missing--

04:02:50.371 --> 04:02:51.307
LIAM: Yeah.

04:02:51.307 --> 04:02:56.907
LAURA: He goes to the Crownsguard to report a
robbery. Then they go in and they find the

04:02:56.907 --> 04:03:04.793
evidence that he was actually trying to be behind
the attack that happened. So it actually is good

04:03:04.793 --> 04:03:08.255
that we destroyed the rug, because it led the
guards into his house.

04:03:08.255 --> 04:03:09.557
SAM: Hmm.

04:03:09.557 --> 04:03:15.763
TRAVIS: I don't know if he would report a robbery
if he had a Rug of Attacking and you triggered it.

04:03:15.763 --> 04:03:18.104
LIAM: And actual connections to the Myriad.

04:03:18.104 --> 04:03:24.682
LAURA: But he-- Are you okay, Beau?

04:03:24.742 --> 04:03:26.410
MARISHA: Smiling is so painful.

04:03:26.476 --> 04:03:27.696
LAURA: It can be.

04:03:27.696 --> 04:03:28.964
MARISHA: (groans)

04:03:28.964 --> 04:03:34.066
LAURA: Should we go spy on his house, and see if
there are crownsguard in it?

04:03:34.066 --> 04:03:36.991
SAM: Oh boy.

04:03:36.991 --> 04:03:38.515
TRAVIS: We could certainly go by.

04:03:38.515 --> 04:03:42.988
LAURA: Do you think they would let anyone back
into the Tri-Spire?

04:03:42.988 --> 04:03:45.425
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, I forgot.

04:03:45.425 --> 04:03:54.861
LIAM: It’ll flip the situation. Dolan, I believe,
was saying that with the High-Richter in place,

04:03:54.861 --> 04:04:02.462
she was favoring Sutan. And now she is gone, Dolan
will hopefully take that seat. If he takes that

04:04:02.462 --> 04:04:07.534
seat, Dolan is not going to protect Lord Sutan in
the way that he claimed that the High-Richter was.

04:04:07.534 --> 04:04:08.739
TRAVIS: That's right.

04:04:08.739 --> 04:04:14.662
LIAM: I don't know, maybe we walk away from the
whole thing. Discuss it as a possibility.

04:04:14.662 --> 04:04:19.924
TRAVIS: We got paid already. How much did I get
paid? Because it was minus Kara's.

04:04:19.924 --> 04:04:29.007
MATT: Minus Kara's, that would have been 628 gold,
21 silver, and 302 copper.

04:04:29.007 --> 04:04:32.103
SAM: Oh, did we get paid?

04:04:32.103 --> 04:04:33.508
TRAVIS: I did.

04:04:33.508 --> 04:04:34.574
LAURA: For what?

04:04:34.574 --> 04:04:35.948
SAM: Fuck that.

04:04:35.948 --> 04:04:37.359
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:04:37.359 --> 04:04:38.717
MATT: So what's the plan?

04:04:38.717 --> 04:04:43.428
LIAM: Well, here's the thing. If Dolan assumes that
seat-- we have no idea if that's going to happen,

04:04:43.478 --> 04:04:49.969
but if Dolan does take that Richter's seat, Sutan,
if nothing happens to him, if no guards go into

04:04:49.969 --> 04:04:56.657
Sutan's house, he knows that his rug is gone, he
realizes someone has been in his home, 100%, he

04:04:56.657 --> 04:05:03.991
looks through the home himself, finds our fake
message from the Myriad or whoever, would he

04:05:03.991 --> 04:05:05.977
retaliate on Dolan? Do we care?

04:05:05.977 --> 04:05:13.546
MARISHA: Yeah, you're actually... yeah. I don't
think you're so far off. There's something weird

04:05:13.546 --> 04:05:16.987
that's been striking me with Dolan this whole
time. He doesn't seem like he really has the

04:05:16.987 --> 04:05:23.000
tenacity of someone who actually wanted that seat.
Maybe he was a pawn this whole time. That guy is

04:05:23.000 --> 04:05:24.304
kind of a coward.

04:05:24.304 --> 04:05:25.643
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

04:05:25.643 --> 04:05:29.134
MARISHA: And I mean this with all due respect --
the guy was kind of a coward!

04:05:29.134 --> 04:05:34.586
LAURA: I am sad that I did that to her, because--

04:05:34.586 --> 04:05:37.166
MARISHA: That's how you do it, right? No?

04:05:37.166 --> 04:05:39.536
TRAVIS: I don't know if they'll send anything back
on Dolan, but we should find a way to get

04:05:39.536 --> 04:05:41.348
crownsguard into Lord Sutan's place.

04:05:41.348 --> 04:05:46.998
LIAM: Well, it was Dolan who said, I believe, he
had the relationship with Orentha, so he was going

04:05:46.998 --> 04:05:53.228
to report this stuff to Orentha and have
crownsguard go in. Now, due to the circumstances

04:05:53.228 --> 04:05:59.241
of the evening, we have missed the element of a
quick surprise. They did not rush in the way we

04:05:59.241 --> 04:06:06.581
had hoped. So he's already realized somebody has
jacked his shit. I'm not worried, really, about

04:06:06.581 --> 04:06:10.291
him finding <i>us</i>, but he had a bad night when he
came home.

04:06:10.291 --> 04:06:14.957
TRAVIS: We can't have Dolan rat on him. Hmm.

04:06:14.957 --> 04:06:20.956
LIAM: But if we don't give a shit about Dolan,
then there's no problem, really. But maybe we do?

04:06:20.956 --> 04:06:27.493
MARISHA: I am really interested in this Kara girl.
I'm wondering if she's a puppet master throughout

04:06:27.493 --> 04:06:28.804
this whole game.

04:06:28.804 --> 04:06:30.387
TRAVIS: Let's try that.

04:06:30.387 --> 04:06:32.109
SAM: So we'll go to the Evening Nip?

04:06:32.109 --> 04:06:33.237
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's try that.

04:06:33.237 --> 04:06:38.639
MATT: Okay, so you guys are going to the Evening
Nip? All right. You make your way over to the

04:06:38.639 --> 04:06:46.640
familiar, dirty, small, sunken dive bar, the same
two beefy-looking guards on the outside eyeing you

04:06:46.640 --> 04:06:52.951
as you enter. You come inside. The same two
individuals sitting at the the same booth and the

04:06:52.951 --> 04:07:00.716
far table. And there lies Clive Binz, the dwarf
with the half-burned beard. As you enter, he's

04:07:00.851 --> 04:07:07.651
like, "Ah, good to see you again. What can I get
you?"

04:07:07.651 --> 04:07:09.299
LAURA: Shit.

04:07:09.299 --> 04:07:20.239
MARISHA: This is Clive the bartender? Hold. Pause.
It's something along the lines of-- Okay.

04:07:20.239 --> 04:07:23.931
SAM: Are we gonna do this? Are we doing the
Gentleman?

04:07:23.931 --> 04:07:26.201
MARISHA: This is Clive the bartender, right?

04:07:26.201 --> 04:07:27.247
MATT: Yeah, Clive.

04:07:27.247 --> 04:07:34.103
MARISHA: Yeah, we are. So Beau and Jester walk up,
and say--

04:07:34.103 --> 04:07:35.603
LAURA: Hi.

04:07:35.603 --> 04:07:36.501
MARISHA: 'Sup.

04:07:36.501 --> 04:07:39.582
MATT: "Can I get you anything?"

04:07:39.582 --> 04:07:41.994
MARISHA: I mean, I know I'd like a drink.

04:07:41.994 --> 04:07:44.468
LAURA: Yes, I would like some milk.

04:07:44.468 --> 04:07:53.855
MARISHA: But unfortunately we have no coin.
However, we are willing to offer many gifts.

04:07:53.855 --> 04:08:02.000
MATT: "Right. Well, then. Take these gifts with
you." He turns around and looks at the rest of

04:08:02.000 --> 04:08:04.434
you, and steps into the back room.

04:08:04.434 --> 04:08:08.308
LAURA: Do we follow him?

04:08:08.308 --> 04:08:09.885
SAM: I'm so scared right now.

04:08:09.885 --> 04:08:10.850
MATT: Do you follow him?

04:08:10.850 --> 04:08:13.199
TRAVIS: Yeah, we fucking follow him into the
room!

04:08:13.199 --> 04:08:18.096
MATT: All right. You step into the back room of
this dive, and as you step inside, it's a storage

04:08:18.096 --> 04:08:26.747
cupboard. There's shelves up there with various
bottles of liquor, wine, and ale. He's currently

04:08:26.747 --> 04:08:31.307
pulling a small chain up on the corner. As he
does, you watch as a small trap door goes

04:08:31.307 --> 04:08:35.335
(creaking), it winches up, and there's a stairway that
leads down. And he goes--

04:08:35.335 --> 04:08:41.097
TRAVIS: Yep.

04:08:41.118 --> 04:08:42.835
MARISHA and LAURA: Thank you.

04:08:42.835 --> 04:08:44.484
SAM: Mazel tov.

04:08:44.484 --> 04:08:50.277
MATT: As you all slowly descend down the stairs,
it closes behind you. You hear a few things

04:08:50.277 --> 04:08:59.886
shift over it. You descend down the stairway, and
you begin to pick up the sound of soft music.

04:08:59.937 --> 04:09:10.589
There's a gentle violin playing, and a lute or
some sort of small string instrument. This

04:09:10.589 --> 04:09:19.086
staircase spirals downward onto the left, and as
it curves down for about 40 or so feet, it's

04:09:19.086 --> 04:09:24.006
getting colder just from the subterranean depth,
that you're going from the warmer surface.

04:09:24.006 --> 04:09:28.965
Eventually, you hear some voices and some
laughter, and a clink of glasses. As you curve

04:09:28.965 --> 04:09:37.564
down, the light gets brighter from around the
corner, until suddenly you look into a stone-set

04:09:37.564 --> 04:09:44.492
subterranean tavern. From floor to ceiling, it's
about 20 feet tall. You can see there are two

04:09:44.492 --> 04:09:49.073
balconies that overlook it from the left side, and
one that's barely visible around the corner, as

04:09:49.073 --> 04:09:53.473
the room opens up to the right of you. There's a
table immediately down from where the spiral

04:09:53.473 --> 04:09:59.215
staircase ends, and there's a gruff-looking fellow
sitting there looking up as you enter. He looks

04:09:59.215 --> 04:10:03.092
immediately defensive. The rest of the people in
there are drinking, and not immediately paying

04:10:03.092 --> 04:10:07.069
attention. As you begin to descend the stairway,
who all’s going in?

04:10:07.069 --> 04:10:08.854
LAURA: All of us.

04:10:08.854 --> 04:10:14.940
MATT: All right. You all begin to descend to the
bottom of the stairs. There's maybe about a dozen

04:10:14.940 --> 04:10:19.638
or so people in here, between the bartender,
folks, and you can see two people are playing

04:10:19.638 --> 04:10:26.183
music on the upper balcony. There's laughter and
discussion, and there's a card game at the center

04:10:26.183 --> 04:10:39.494
table. You see a maroon and dull grey robed person
arrive, but their body is covered with a dark

04:10:39.494 --> 04:10:48.195
black, almost panther-like fur. Their face is
cat-like, with ears that curl up. This is a black

04:10:48.195 --> 04:11:02.614
tabaxi that has turned around the corner, and
goes, "Halt, friends. I do not recognize-- Lucien?"

04:11:02.614 --> 04:11:04.648
SAM: Who? What?

04:11:04.648 --> 04:11:06.940
MATT: (incredulous) "You're alive!"

04:11:06.940 --> 04:11:11.165
TALIESIN: Oh, sorry, friend, I've got one of those
faces people tend to recognize.

04:11:11.165 --> 04:11:18.676
MATT: (gasping in disbelief) "Lucien!" She goes
forward and does a huge hug.

04:11:18.676 --> 04:11:20.419
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll go with it.

04:11:20.564 --> 04:11:21.785
MATT: And that's where we're going to end
tonight's episode!

04:11:21.785 --> 04:11:23.332
(screaming)

04:11:23.332 --> 04:11:27.973
TRAVIS: (shouting) Insight check! Insight check on
Taliesin! Insight check!

04:11:28.048 --> 04:11:29.743
MATT: We'll come back to that.

04:11:29.743 --> 04:11:34.519
That's a d10, that doesn't matter.

04:11:34.581 --> 04:11:39.426
SAM, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Lucien?!

04:11:39.426 --> 04:11:40.606
LAURA: Lucien?! That's a cool name!

04:11:40.606 --> 04:11:42.065
SAM: What?! Who's that?

04:11:42.065 --> 04:11:43.172
TALIESIN: Don't know.

04:11:43.172 --> 04:11:45.766
MARISHA: Who the fuck?

04:11:45.766 --> 04:11:47.361
LAURA: Everybody's a liar!

04:11:47.361 --> 04:11:51.918
LIAM: This is just the first layer of the onion.
There's eight more names to come!

04:11:51.918 --> 04:11:53.373
SAM: He's actually a robot!

04:11:53.373 --> 04:11:56.571
TRAVIS: Look at Taliesin right now. Just look at
him.

04:11:56.571 --> 04:11:57.870
LAURA: You sneaky bastard!

04:11:57.870 --> 04:11:59.835
TALIESIN: You fuckers don't know shit.

04:11:59.835 --> 04:12:01.893
LIAM: You fake-name-making motherfucker!

04:12:01.893 --> 04:12:03.840
MARISHA: How many names have you had?!

04:12:03.840 --> 04:12:10.309
SAM: An hour ago you were telling me that I had to
<i>trust</i> you people! You lying fuckers!

04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:14.973
MARISHA: No, we never said to trust us! We said
<i>not</i> to trust us specifically!

04:12:14.973 --> 04:12:16.601
TRAVIS: I didn't say anything!

04:12:16.601 --> 04:12:25.769
MATT: All righty. We'll pick up from <i>that</i> point
next week. Until then, we'll see some of you guys at

04:12:25.769 --> 04:12:31.673
C2E2 in Chicago this weekend. Looking forward to
that! We'll be back on this next Thursday to see

04:12:31.673 --> 04:12:33.258
where this goes.

04:12:33.258 --> 04:12:34.505
TALIESIN: So excited.

04:12:34.505 --> 04:12:43.597
MATT: (giggles) Until then, we love you guys. Have
a wonderful week, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

04:12:43.597 --> 04:23:52.511

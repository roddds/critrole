[cheering]

00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:14.940
BRIAN: What's up, motherfuckers?!

3
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.815
[cheering]

4
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.500
BRIAN: In celebration of my favorite television show

5
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.500
sadly coming to an end
[laughter]

6
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.320
my costume this year is a joke

7
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.443
for exactly 23% of our audience.

8
00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:39.859
[cheering]

9
00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.510
Here's some of the names that were thrown around

10
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.679
backstage just now: Janky Alexander,

11
00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.190
[laughter]

12
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.087
Kat Von D Minus.
[laughter]

13
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.040
The cool thing about this outfit is

14
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.320
every tattoo leads to a different clue

15
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.316
about why my parents didn't love me as a child.

16
00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:05.150
[laughter]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Brian!

17
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.168
BRIAN: I love you too, goddamn it.

18
00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:12.026
[cheering]

19
00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:14.010
I look like if Jared Leto's Joker

20
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.907
auditioned for John Wick (laughs).

21
00:02:17.907 --> 00:02:18.777
I feel like...

22
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.170
All right, all right.

23
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.222
Welcome to Critical Role Live at Gen Con.

24
00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:29.222
[cheering]

25
00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:37.550
I had this wig made from Laura's discarded hair.

26
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.020
Just kidding, every week before the show

27
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.670
I clip a little bit of it off and put it in a Ziploc.

28
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.950
Hey, at intermission, if you didn't already,

29
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.870
say hi to Tal and everybody in our crew

30
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.570
that's working at the merch booth.

31
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.674
They will have stuff for sale still

32
00:02:51.674 --> 00:02:54.443
during intermission.

33
00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:57.200
Before we bring out the cast, we like to ask a few things

34
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.410
of everybody that's in attendance at the live show

35
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.830
so you can have the best experience

36
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.380
and so the folks at home watching

37
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.420
can have the best experience.

38
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.920
We are live broadcasting this and it will available on

39
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.810
everywhere that our shit ends up available, so

40
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.930
outside of the occasional picture or two,

41
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.560
there's no reason to have your phone up

42
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.970
filming what's happening because we have

43
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.250
much better cameras than your phone.

44
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.170
And God forbid you're one of those people

45
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.303
that goes to a concert or something and films with an iPad!

46
00:03:26.303 --> 00:03:27.914
[laughter]

47
00:03:27.914 --> 00:03:32.843
[booing]

48
00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:34.450
Get your fucking iPads out of here, man.

49
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.260
If I see it, it's over.

50
00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.070
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fuck him up, Brian!

51
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.115
BRIAN: I will fuck him up, dude. Look at this shit.

52
00:03:41.115 --> 00:03:43.960
[cheering]

53
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.700
Take anybody right now.
[laughter]

54
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.590
Also, there's going to be a lot of super fun stuff

55
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.950
that happens tonight.

56
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.430
Something that isn't fun is when people shout suggestions,

57
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.890
rules, jokes they think are funny

58
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.259
at the players while we're playing.

59
00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.418
It's not very fun and most of the jokes are pretty bad.

60
00:04:03.418 --> 00:04:05.785
Take it from someone who knows.

61
00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:07.530
Be respectful of the people around you

62
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.560
and of the folks at home and to not distract them

63
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.420
because, let's be honest,

64
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.270
they all have very short attention spans.

65
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.060
[laughter]

66
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.253
Let's see, anything else?

67
00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:23.130
Someone wanted me to shout them out, but I'm not going to.

68
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.100
Yeah, we are going to have an intermission

69
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.730
and you can use the restroom then

70
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.400
because, as you guys remember, in this theater,

71
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.835
the seats are creaky as fuck!

72
00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:34.860
So try to minimize your getting up

73
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.660
and sitting down if you can because it's like

74
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.790
someone's stabbing a frog, like every third thing.

75
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.940
It's like the craziest thing.

76
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.860
Last but not least, don't forget to love each other.

77
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.860
Respect--
[cheering]

78
00:04:51.913 --> 00:04:53.970
Respect everybody around you.

79
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.940
If someone has too much to drink,

80
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.710
you know, just knock them out, let them sleep it off

81
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.980
until the show's over.

82
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.230
Just be respectful to everybody around you and

83
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.500
I know it's dark and if you're getting up

84
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.380
and moving around and stuff, also think about

85
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.450
all of our friends that are in cosplay with

86
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.380
expensive and delicate items,

87
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.820
unlike the fucking outfit I'm wearing right now.

88
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.113
Without further ado,

89
00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:18.460
[cheering]

90
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.373
I would like to introduce the cast of Critical Role.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.092
and expressive and,

143
00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:03.581
I think I read the wrong email.

I think you got it very right.

sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

MATT: (laughs) This is so insane. (laughs)

159
00:08:54.355 --> 00:08:56.069
What's great, too, is with the lights on us,

160
00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:59.036
all we see is darkness and so it's very Eldritch horror.

161
00:08:59.036 --> 00:09:02.161
It's just a wall of voices.
TALIESIN: Just the two lights.

162
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:06.440
MATT: And the two beaming lights of-- it's amazing.

Last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

312
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.770
after sending some friends and family to safety

313
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.130
in Nicodranas, made their way to the Greying Wildlands

314
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.250
in search of answers regarding both

315
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.760
the fractured halves of this blade

316
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.240
that had been gathered across their adventures

317
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.000
and possibly these visions that had come

318
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.350
through the Wildmother to Caduceus Clay.

319
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:08.270
Upon seeking another remnant of the Raven Queen's

320
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.987
historical pact with the Wildmother,

321
00:16:10.987 --> 00:16:14.560
you made your way towards Kravaraad, the volcanic mountain,

322
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.460
to Cinderrest Sanctum, or as you know it,

323
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.240
as the Burning Lodge, amongst the Clay family,

324
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.523
to meet the Dust family.

325
00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:23.740
While you were here, you learned a bit

326
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.650
of the history of this blade, and the individual,

327
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.390
Dulgrim Smeltborne, who apparently

328
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.120
still resides in the city of Uthodurn.

329
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.270
As you spent the evening there,

330
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.250
visions came to Fjord of his,

331
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.230
I don't know what you would call it.

332
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.063
Faithful?

333
00:16:43.063 --> 00:16:44.058
Not at all.

334
00:16:44.058 --> 00:16:47.140
A dark entity known as Uk'otoa,

335
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.095
in which you had fallen into a pact with long ago--

336
00:16:51.095 --> 00:16:54.044
[laughter]
That's awesome.

337
00:16:54.044 --> 00:16:56.327
[cheering]

338
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.000
Who is very unhappy

339
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.050
that you had absconded with the third and final

340
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.790
means of unsealing his current fate,

341
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.730
and showed that the power you had been granted

342
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.760
can indeed be taken away.

343
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.150
You, however, in the face of this challenge,

344
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.700
placed your own blade into your chest,

345
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.200
played essentially chicken with this entity,

346
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.060
and when it wasn't going your way,

347
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.520
threw your pact blade into

348
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.333
the actual molten center of the Cinderrest Sanctum.

349
00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:39.183
[cheering]

350
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.860
Seemingly now absolved of your pact,

351
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.703
powerless compared to your previous travels,

352
00:17:50.703 --> 00:17:54.110
you came forward with your friends

353
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.180
about your current predicament.

354
00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.390
As you gathered various items of support,

355
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.950
you all sought for more answers,

356
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.010
seeking this Dulgrim, possible elements

357
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.910
of the refined residuum that may be connected

358
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.995
to Caduceus Clay's vision,

359
00:18:10.995 --> 00:18:15.112
and leaving the mountain into the freshly snow-set

360
00:18:15.112 --> 00:18:16.780
mountainsides of the Flotket Alps,

361
00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.540
began traveling southwest, towards the city of Uthodurn.

362
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.667
So Mighty Nein,

363
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.178
how would you like to progress?

364
00:18:28.487 --> 00:18:29.665
SAM: Uh...

365
00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:32.875
[laughter]

366
00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:35.870
LAURA: Are we outside of the entrance already?

367
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.080
Is it like, we're in the snow?

368
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.390
MATT: You guys were just stepping out

369
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.490
and where there's the fresh snowfall,

370
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.700
the storm that came last night, seemed to have past.

371
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.780
Still gray sky, but there's a fresh snowfall

372
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.590
that has come across the Alps.

373
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.420
LAURA: All right, how do we get there?

374
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.320
SAM: Yes, did anyone ask for directions

375
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.450
before we left the Kiln?

376
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.030
MARISHA: Well, we have a map.
TALIESIN: We do have a map.

377
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.040
SAM: Oh, we have a map?
MARISHA: Yeah.

378
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.362
SAM: Great, let's just follow it and go tell Laura Dern.

379
00:18:58.362 --> 00:19:02.200
MARISHA: Yeah.
[laughter]

380
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.700
TALIESIN: I suppose we'll check to make sure

381
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.580
we're taking the safest path, too,

382
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.770
if there's anything we should be looking out for.

383
00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:09.603
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: There's a path

384
00:19:09.603 --> 00:19:11.720
marked on the map?

385
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.350
MATT: There isn't so much a path marked,

386
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.445
but there are positions across it.

387
00:19:16.445 --> 00:19:18.360
LAURA: It looks fairly obvious looking at that

388
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.440
where we should go for sure.

389
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.830
TRAVIS: We are here.

390
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.160
We're going there.

391
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.090
Mountains.

392
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.670
MARISHA: So there's only two mountains in the way.

393
00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.300
That's nothing-- look at all these mountains.

394
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.420
SAM: Can we go between the mountains?

395
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.715
TRAVIS: It specifically says do not go

396
00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.730
between the mountains.

397
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.960
SAM: That accent is super weird.

398
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.650
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?
[laughter]

399
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.653
SAM: You talk funny.

400
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.840
LIAM: Do the mountains block the direct route

401
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.340
if we were to set out on foot?

402
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.980
MATT: If you want to go ahead and take a look

403
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.870
to the direction you're currently--

404
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.420
LAURA: I'm just going to run back inside really fast, okay?

405
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.880
I'll be right back.

406
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.257
And I'm going to go ask for directions.

407
00:20:01.257 --> 00:20:03.247
[laughter]

408
00:20:03.247 --> 00:20:07.096
MARISHA: I'm going to follow Jester.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

409
00:20:07.096 --> 00:20:08.070
MARISHA: I'm going to follow Jester.

410
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.780
LAURA: Yeah, if you could just write them down

411
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.340
because I'm kind of bad at remembering things.

412
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.190
TALIESIN: Anything we may run into

413
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.290
if there's anything particularly dangerous.

414
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.430
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.630
MATT: All right, so you rush back in.

416
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.165
You go ahead and see Jeramess Dust is currently sitting down

417
00:20:22.165 --> 00:20:25.590
and looks like enjoying some sort of a morning coffee.

418
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.690
Some sort of hot beverage, blowing it off,

419
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.000
and as you approach from the entryway tunnels

420
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.850
that lead you deep into the sanctum

421
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.370
and she looks up and goes, "Oh, hello, again."

422
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.080
LAURA: It was a really, we were there and back,

423
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.858
or, how do we get there?

424
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.790
MATT: "You go southwest.

425
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.460
"Eventually look for

426
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.920
"a series of small towers and--"

427
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.140
LAURA: Just southwest?

428
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.474
MATT: "Yeah."

429
00:20:57.474 --> 00:20:58.680
[laughter]

430
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.890
LAURA: Is there a path or a road or how do you--

431
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.000
MATT: "There is when there isn't fresh snowfall

432
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.836
"because that covers the path, but."

433
00:21:06.836 --> 00:21:08.580
LAURA: That makes sense.

434
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.413
Okay.
MATT: "Put it this way.

435
00:21:09.413 --> 00:21:11.528
"When you look out and you go straight

436
00:21:11.528 --> 00:21:12.380
"to where the southwest is,

"The next mountain you see, go around the right side."

440
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:20.990
LAURA: That's perfect, that's all we need.

441
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.030
MATT: "Past there, you might find it.

442
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.920
"Just keep your eyes peeled."

443
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.140
MARISHA: What kind of fiends or beasts might we encounter?

444
00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.690
Anything that you know of?

445
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.296
MATT: "There's all sorts of creatures
that call the Alps home.

446
00:21:34.296 --> 00:21:37.900
"There's wolves, winter wolves, dire wolves--"

447
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.810
MARISHA: Lots of wolves.

448
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.400
MATT: "There's the orcs of Boroftkrah

449
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.080
"and the various other wandering Rime Plains orcs

"that come up here for hunting

451
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.690
"because of the better game up here in the mountains."

452
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.990
MARISHA: Do they hunt the wolves?

453
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.880
MATT: "Probably and wargs, too, they bring down

454
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.280
"from the path south of here.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.160

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.710
"just try your best to not be seen."

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.240
LAURA: Oh, hm, okay, we're pretty stealthy.

459
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.890
MATT: "Good, good, you might survive."

460
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.520
MARISHA: What do these towers look like?

461
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.100
We know it's an elven city, are they?

462
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.020
MATT: "It's elf and dwarf, actually."

463
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.730
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, sorry.

464
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.822
MATT: "It's all right, but you see,

465
00:22:19.822 --> 00:22:21.620
"around the base of the mountain,

LAURA: Caleb!

471
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.870
Where is southwest?

472
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.770
LIAM: It's that way.

473
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.338
LAURA: Then that's where we're going.

474
00:22:37.338 --> 00:22:39.430
[laughter]

475
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:40.970
MARISHA: So we're going to get to the first mountain

476
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.140
and we're going to take a right.

477
00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.190
LAURA: No, a left.
LIAM: I thought it was a--

478
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.356
MARISHA: Shit!

479
00:22:44.356 --> 00:22:46.470
[laughter]

480
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.800
Okay, we're going to get to the first mountain,

481
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.633
we're going to take a left,

482
00:22:48.633 --> 00:22:49.950
and then we're going to get to the second mountain

483
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:51.010
and then we're going to take a right.

484
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.880
LIAM: Right, so we go lefty-loosey, then righty-tighty,

485
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.594
and then we are there.
TALIESIN: Right.

486
00:22:55.594 --> 00:22:56.780
TRAVIS: And then towers.

487
00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.262
SAM: Easiest adventure we've ever gone on.

488
00:23:00.262 --> 00:23:02.410
TRAVIS: No problem.
SAM: Let's go!

489
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.800
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Stealthily!

490
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.740
MATT: All right, first and foremost,

491
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.660
I need a marching order from you guys.

492
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.061
TRAVIS: I'm in the back.

493
00:23:08.061 --> 00:23:11.504
[laughter]

494
00:23:11.504 --> 00:23:13.150
MATT: All right, we got Fjord in the back.

495
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.600
LAURA: Actually, Fjord, maybe in the middle,

496
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.360
because if something comes up from behind us.

497
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.057
LIAM: As the former weakest person in this group--

498
00:23:20.057 --> 00:23:23.057
[laughter]

499
00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:28.730
SAM: Caleb, Caleb, you're very strong!

500
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.440
LIAM: I also used to think the rear was the ideal position,

501
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.690
but maybe second to last or possibly third to last

502
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.164
or maybe all of us around you in a protective ring.

503
00:23:37.164 --> 00:23:40.164
[laughter]

504
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.490
MARISHA: You have your shield, right?

505
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:44.710
TRAVIS: I do, I have a shield, yes, and--

506
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.820
MARISHA: Have you ever fought with a shield before?

507
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.970
TRAVIS: No.
MARISHA: All right.

508
00:23:49.852 --> 00:23:54.852
TALIESIN: You need to make a Caleb-Fjord hot pocket.

509
00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.966
It's not quite a sandwich, it's like a--

510
00:23:56.966 --> 00:23:59.232
MARISHA: Maybe we should double layer it,

511
00:23:59.232 --> 00:24:01.707
you know, like a, yeah, okay.

512
00:24:01.707 --> 00:24:04.350
LIAM: What are we talking about?

513
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.380
TALIESIN: I'll take front then.

514
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.610
LAURA: I'll take back.
TALIESIN: All right.

515
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:07.891
LAURA: There you go.

516
00:24:07.891 --> 00:24:09.350
MATT: All right, so we have Caduceus up front.

517
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.490
SAM: I'll go in the front with Ducey.

518
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.450
MATT: All righty.

519
00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.567
MARISHA: I'll be behind Nott.

520
00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:15.720
MATT: Where are you, Beauregard?

521
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.940
MARISHA: Behind Nott.

522
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.840
MATT: Behind them?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

523
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.673
MATT: We have at the front,

524
00:24:18.673 --> 00:24:20.420
we have Caduceus and Nott up front,

525
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.340
behind them, we have Beauregard,

526
00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.000
in the center, we have Fjord, and then behind them

527
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.720
we have Caleb and Jester.

528
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.553
LAURA: Sounds perfect.

529
00:24:25.553 --> 00:24:27.244
TRAVIS: ♪ Hot Pocket ♪

530
00:24:27.244 --> 00:24:29.818
[laughter]

531
00:24:29.818 --> 00:24:30.770
MATT: I don't think we can clear that.

532
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.400
LIAM: I think that's Goth Pocket.

533
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.590
TALIESIN: Goth Pocket.
TRAVIS: Goth Pocket, yes.

534
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.282
MATT: All righty, so--
SAM: We're a Lock Pocket?

535
00:24:38.282 --> 00:24:42.370
(Marisha laughs)
SAM: Nope.

536
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.220
MATT: Who is guiding the direction of this?

537
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.360
You're at the front?

538
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.040
SAM: I guess I am?

539
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.490
MATT: Who's taking point in guiding the group

540
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.230
is what I'm asking.
SAM: Yeah, Caduceus and I.

541
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.250
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

542
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.090
Either one of you make a nature check with advantage

543
00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.500
or both of you take one separately.

544
00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.540
TRAVIS: First roll, come on!

545
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.870
TALIESIN: You with nature check, advantage,

546
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.840
because my nature's terrible.
LAURA: We should be stealthy.

547
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.500
We were warned not to be so--

548
00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.673
SAM: With advantage?

549
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:08.923
Thank god, that's cocked.

550
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.526
Ooh, shitty, shitty, shitty bang-bang.

551
00:25:12.526 --> 00:25:14.500
[laughter]

552
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.080
11.

553
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.720
MATT: 11, all righty, all righty.

554
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.110
TALIESIN: That was, yeah, you don't even want to know.

555
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.820
I just took a fun roll, no.

556
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.140
MARISHA: What?

557
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.990
TRAVIS: We're fucked.

558
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.823
TALIESIN: Yeah.

559
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.180
MATT: Nott continues to guide you guys

560
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.910
around the same lake that you had previously traversed,

561
00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.390
keeping an eye on the sky above.

562
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.520
Beau, go ahead and make a perception check

563
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.220
just to keep looking above in the vicinity around you.

564
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.320
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

565
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.720
14.
MATT: 14, good, all right.

566
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.550
Continuing forward, the wind isn't terribly strong,

567
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.967
but it does pick up in gusts here and there and

568
00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.510
(whooshes) blows past a moment.

569
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.587
Kind of swelling on occasion.

570
00:25:56.587 --> 00:26:01.020
The ice and snow-capped trees eventually consume the horizon

571
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.690
as you lower down from the base of the mountain

572
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.130
into the central forest heading across

573
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.940
towards the one mountain to the southwest

574
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.740
that Caleb had pointed out.

575
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.910
Right as you begin to lose vision,

576
00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.720
you begin to see clusters moving briefly.

577
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.100
Beauregard keeping a close eye out

578
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.440
and Caduceus also keenly aware that

579
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.140
what looks almost like slow avalanches

580
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.200
and sections moving separately,

581
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.360
you just barely squint your eyes

582
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.210
and you can see instead they are small clusters

583
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.230
of wild white bison moving across the exterior

584
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.150
of the distant mountain,

585
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.470
causing this optical illusion effect.

586
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.075
But you keep close to yourselves for warmth

587
00:26:40.075 --> 00:26:43.875
and dive under the canopy of the forest, continuing onward.

588
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.670
The first hour

589
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.453
seems to go by fine.

590
00:26:52.416 --> 00:26:54.430
A couple more hours, you guys eventually make it

591
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.480
towards the base of the first mountain,

592
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.970
at least you begin to see the treeline break apart,

593
00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.810
you can see where it begins to ascend up the side

594
00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:02.930
of that rocky cliff.

595
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:06.500
MARISHA: We forgot to ask how long of a journey this was.

596
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.760
SAM: They told us it was like a day, day-and-a-half.

597
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.363
MARISHA: Oh.
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

598
00:27:10.363 --> 00:27:11.620
MATT: All right, so are you guys continuing

599
00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.960
to move stealthily by the way?

600
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.090
LAURA: Yeah.

601
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.700
MATT: That does slow your travel.

602
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.610
So it might take a little longer

603
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.230
than a day-and-a-half stealthily.

604
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.730
LAURA: I think stealthy is better, though, right?

605
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.930
TRAVIS: We're leaving tracks behind us, yes?

606
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:24.763
Quite a few?

607
00:27:24.763 --> 00:27:25.620
LAURA: No, I'm behind us.

608
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.105
I'm using my tail to brush them as we walk.

609
00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:30.570
[laughter]

610
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:34.290
MATT: Roll a stealth check to see how well you're doing.

611
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.230
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

612
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.400
LAURA: Which one?

613
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.740
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: (like Jester) The cute one.

614
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.530
LAURA: Stealth, 17.

615
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.250
MATT: Okay, you think you're doing an all right job

616
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.950
covering some of the tracks.

617
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.280
Doesn't look like nobody walked through.

618
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.080
Now it just looks like one weird, drunk worm

619
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.686
has been pushing its way through the snow.

620
00:27:49.686 --> 00:27:50.940
[laughter]

621
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.110
LAURA: Hey, man, a worm is better than a group of people.

622
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.327
MATT: Could be helpful, we'll see.

623
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.451
TRAVIS: Fuck that.

624
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:03.034
(laughter)

625
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.950
MATT: Continuing onward, for the next few hours,

626
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.420
you guys are turning right or left

627
00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.430
against the first mountain you come across?

628
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.690
TALIESIN: Left.

629
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.140
MATT: All right, look at that.

630
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.640
You got a memory, that's good.

631
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:18.750
Curving around the base.

632
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.870
Are you staying within the treeline

633
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.080
or are you coasting up on the side of the mountain?

634
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.720
MARISHA: Let me scout it real quick, how about that?

635
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.720
SAM: Oh, yeah, sure.

636
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.660
MARISHA: I'll go up the mountain a little bit

637
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.810
and see if I can scale a tree, get a viewpoint.

638
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:31.970
MATT: Sure, all right, go ahead and make an athletics check.

639
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.400
MARISHA: Wait, you don't still have your bird, right?

640
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.940
Is your cat a bird or is your cat a cat?

641
00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.320
LIAM: It's always a cat.

642
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.480
MARISHA: But, okay, you know what I mean.

643
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.430
TRAVIS: Yeah, it changes sometimes.

644
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.910
Where's the octopus?
LIAM: There is a--

645
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.235
who said that?

646
00:28:45.235 --> 00:28:50.218
[laughter]

647
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.305
MARISHA: He lost his powers, he's not deaf.

648
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.770
LIAM: There is a cat shaped like a cat

649
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.170
sitting next to you on the ground now, so,

650
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.003
that's what you got.

651
00:29:02.003 --> 00:29:03.780
MARISHA: All right. I scale the tree.

652
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.100
MATT: Athletics or acrobats, your choice,

653
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.510
since the trees here are pretty close together.

654
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.235
MARISHA: Acrobatics.
MATT: Go for it.

655
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.565
TRAVIS: Wow, that was a cool roll.

656
00:29:12.565 --> 00:29:13.398
Yo!

657
00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.888
MARISHA: 27.
SAM: Whoa.

658
00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:19.254
[cheering]

659
00:29:19.254 --> 00:29:22.110
MATT: Yeah, like an Olympic gymnast,

660
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.730
leaping from tree branch to tree branch,

661
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.800
you watch as Beau quickly ascends to the top of the tree.

662
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.669
As you poke out past the canopy and look ahead, you can see

663
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:31.710
along the mountainside, there are clusters of trees.

664
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.030
This one mountain isn't too much of a spire-like.

665
00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.220
It tends to break off towards the top

666
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.450
and there's a bit of a roundedness to its edge there.

667
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.320
There looks to be some sort of a watchtower

668
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.740
built on the top of it.

669
00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.450
You're not sure of the quality or if it's manned or not,

670
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.980
but that's towards the peak of the mountain.

671
00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.470
MARISHA: Can I tell what it's made out of?

672
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.940
Is it like a wooden?
MATT: At this distance?

673
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.038
MARISHA: Wooden watchtower?

674
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.730
MATT: Make a perception check to see

675
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:56.820
if you can make out any details,

676
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.090
because it's quite a ways away from you.

677
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.130
It's probably like--
(Travis groans)

678
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.880
MARISHA: Natural one!

679
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.090
MATT: As you're picking upward,

680
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.940
one of the frost zephyr birds flies by

681
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.470
and poops right in your eye

682
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.660
[laughter]
and you're like (groans)

683
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.250
and your eyes just have a hard time focusing

684
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.880
once you wipe it free and, unfortunately, at this point,

685
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.290
everything just looks like it's covered in snow

686
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.730
and you're stinging really bad.

687
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.170
MARISHA: Fucking birds.

688
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.290
I'm glad Thaddeus is gone.
[laughter]

689
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.738
MATT: You swear you heard it (hooting).

690
00:30:25.738 --> 00:30:28.738
[laughter]

691
00:30:32.533 --> 00:30:35.364
LIAM: All birds are assholes.

692
00:30:35.364 --> 00:30:37.942
MATT: As a bird owner, kind of.

693
00:30:37.942 --> 00:30:39.410
I love them, they're assholes.

694
00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.393
MARISHA: All right, I can see the--

695
00:30:41.393 --> 00:30:43.093
oh, I go back down to the group.

696
00:30:43.093 --> 00:30:46.260
I don't know if that's, do I need to?

697
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.370
MATT: After a natural one, go ahead and roll

698
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.850
another acrobatics check.

699
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.508
With disadvantage.

700
00:30:51.508 --> 00:30:55.032
[laughter]

701
00:30:55.032 --> 00:30:56.347
TRAVIS: You got shit in your eye.

702
00:30:56.347 --> 00:30:57.940
LIAM: Caleb has been watching through Frumpkin

703
00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.350
all this time as well.
MARISHA: Shit in my eye

704
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.275
doesn't affect my dope abs, though.

705
00:31:02.275 --> 00:31:04.643
[laughter]

706
00:31:04.643 --> 00:31:06.820
TRAVIS: Hey!
MARISHA: It's still good.

707
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.740
19.
MATT: Yeah, see,

708
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.110
it doesn't affect you at all.

709
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.660
You were fine.
MARISHA: Okay.

710
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.450
MATT: Almost without having to use your vision

711
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.080
and as much as it's stinging and blinking,

712
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.460
you manage to leap down without issue,

713
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.070
making your way to the base.

714
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.180
Beau comes down with this streak of white

715
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.680
on one side of the face.
SAM: Oh, what happened?

716
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.040
MARISHA: So there's a tower up ahead

717
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.290
and I think, like a fucked up mountain.

718
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.070
Probably the mountain we're going.

719
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.660
Looks like a watchtower.

720
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.558
Jester?

721
00:31:30.558 --> 00:31:31.599
LAURA: Hmm?

722
00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:34.899
MARISHA: Or Caduceus, do either one of you have a wet wipe?

723
00:31:34.899 --> 00:31:37.100
[laughter]

724
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.880
LAURA: I use the bottom of my sleeve.

725
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.430
MARISHA: Thank you.
LAURA: You're welcome.

726
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.920
MARISHA: It looks like some sort of watchtower.

727
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.400
I don't know, I was just trying to get a--

728
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.220
SAM: Is that the tower that we are looking for?

729
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.710
MARISHA: Nah.

730
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.661
LIAM: So we stick to the trees then.

731
00:31:51.661 --> 00:31:53.770
SAM: Okay.
MATT: All right.

732
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.400
You head to the left,

733
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.360
continue around the base of the mountain.

734
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.830
Are you guys going stealthily?

735
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.890
LAURA: Mm-hm.
SAM: Sure.

736
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.290
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check, please.

737
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.190
TRAVIS: You moved up and down that mountain incredibly well.

738
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.669
How long does it take to learn to do that?

739
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:09.669
[laughter]

740
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.650
SAM: Fjord, if you want, Fjord,

741
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.600
I could teach you how to use a crossbow.

742
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.446
My five-year-old can do it.

743
00:32:19.446 --> 00:32:22.456
[laughter]

744
00:32:22.456 --> 00:32:26.031
[cheering]

745
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.572
TRAVIS: That would be lovely, thank you.

746
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.260
MARISHA: I gotcha, Captain, I got your back.

747
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.300
I just, you know, I just.

748
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.640
MATT: Stealth checks around the table.

749
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.050
SAM: 27.
MATT: 27, Jester?

750
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.040
LAURA: Seven.
MATT: Seven.

751
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.260
TALIESIN: 12.
MATT: 12.

752
00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.290
TRAVIS: 13.
MARISHA: 21.

753
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:53.235
LIAM: Also seven.
SAM: Ooh.

754
00:32:53.235 --> 00:32:55.350
TALIESIN: We don't have Pass Without a Trace, so.

755
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.183
MATT: Okay.

756
00:32:57.463 --> 00:32:59.070
TRAVIS: I did okay.
SAM: It's on.

757
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.787
LAURA: Yeah, I didn't cast it.

758
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.890
TRAVIS: No, no, it's not on, no, no.

759
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.788
MATT: All right, so.

760
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.880
As you guys dive into the treeline,

761
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.060
making your way around the edge of the mountain,

762
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.720
you get probably around three-quarters of the path

763
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.570
before you begin to head back in that straight line

764
00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.220
through the mountain range that leads you

765
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.520
in the direction you were told there would be.

766
00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.539
As you're moving forward, Caduceus,

767
00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:25.560
you can see

768
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:31.530
a couple of prints in the snow directly ahead.

769
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:36.453
Small, clustered, forward, quadrupedal.

770
00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:42.360
TALIESIN: How close are we to the prints?

771
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.700
MATT: You see them about 30 feet ahead of you

772
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.483
and to the right.

773
00:33:46.483 --> 00:33:48.710
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a long look around.

774
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.950
I'm going to stop everybody and take a long look around

775
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.450
to see if there's anything waiting to pounce.

776
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.120
MATT: Make a perception check.
TALIESIN: All right.

777
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.850
These I'm good at.

778
00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.420
Ah, that's better, 22.

779
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.450
MATT: Glancing a little ways ahead,

780
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.390
you can see two wolves,

781
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.910
white-gray fur.

782
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.680
Relatively large comparison to a regular wolf.

783
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.220
Not massive, but maybe, I'd say,

784
00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:15.370
nine or so feet from snout to rear.

785
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:16.203
SAM: That's big.

786
00:34:16.203 --> 00:34:17.920
MATT: There's two of them in a pair,

787
00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.370
just making their way through carefully,

788
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.560
through the center of the forest.

789
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.420
They don't seem to notice your presence yet.

790
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.070
They're about a hundred feet ahead of you.

791
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.650
TALIESIN: They're going to the right?

792
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.010
They're heading their own direction?

793
00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.277
MATT: They were.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

794
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.750
Have they noticed us?

795
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.670
MATT: One of them seems to be going (sniffs)

796
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.650
and glances over in your direction.

797
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:40.730
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to say,

798
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.200
in the manner that one can talk to wolves:

799
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.820
I really don't recommend this.

800
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.391
I know this looks easy, but this is going to end so badly.

801
00:34:49.391 --> 00:34:52.391
[laughter]

802
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:58.330
MATT: You watch as it stops and then gets low.

803
00:34:58.577 --> 00:34:59.820
It seems to, as it gets low,

804
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.040
vanish beneath one of the little snowbanks

805
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.510
and you lose sight of where it may be.

806
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:05.343
TALIESIN: Okay.

807
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.440
MATT: The other one follows suit,

808
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.590
curving around

809
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.510
in a pincer formation to the left.

810
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.760
Then also dips down below one of the nearby forest banks

811
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.170
where the small hill rises up

812
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.740
and you don't see it emerge from the other side of the hill.

813
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.420
You've now lost sight of both of the wolves.

814
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.850
TALIESIN: There's at least two wolves currently circling us

815
00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.860
and they're going to make an attempt to eat us,

816
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.553
at least two, possibly more.

817
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.350
I guess get ready, kids.

818
00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:33.990
TRAVIS: Are you sure that's not just behavior

819
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:35.090
that lets us pass?

820
00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.950
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

821
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:42.500
MARISHA: Should we run?

822
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.160
Is running a good idea?

823
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.670
TALIESIN: I think flank and prepare.

824
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:47.770
MARISHA: Okay.

825
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:48.603
TALIESIN: Let's make a circle.

826
00:35:48.603 --> 00:35:50.380
LAURA: Circle up around Fjord.

827
00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.630
SAM: And Caleb.
[laughter]

828
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:56.080
LIAM: These are regular-sized wolves.

829
00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.270
I think I will be on the outside, it is all right.

830
00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.040
TALIESIN: They're about nine-- they're pretty big.

831
00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.160
LIAM: They are big ones?

832
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.860
TALIESIN: They're pretty big.
MARISHA: They're nine feet long.

833
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.775
TALIESIN: Bigger than you.

834
00:36:05.775 --> 00:36:07.478
LAURA: Get in the middle, Caleb.

835
00:36:07.478 --> 00:36:09.850
[laughter]

836
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.520
LIAM: I have thought better of it.

837
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.077
I will go in the middle.

838
00:36:13.077 --> 00:36:16.255
[laughter]

839
00:36:16.255 --> 00:36:18.233
I cast Mage Armor.

840
00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:19.566
TALIESIN: I'll say,

841
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.970
yeah, Fjord, you don't have to stay in the middle

842
00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:25.640
if you don't want to, if you want to test out how you feel.

843
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.704
TRAVIS: Mm, okay.
LAURA: Don't do it, don't.

844
00:36:27.704 --> 00:36:28.980
[laughter]

845
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.140
MATT: So Fjord, you're staying in the center?

846
00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.610
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.
MATT: All right.

847
00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.940
You guys encircle Fjord and begin--

848
00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.340
LAURA: And Caleb, and Caleb, too, now.

849
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.791
MATT: Caleb as well in the center? All right.

850
00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:40.597
SAM: Ladies and Caduceus surround.

851
00:36:40.597 --> 00:36:43.026
[laughter]

852
00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:46.026
[cheering]

853
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:51.390
Squad!

854
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.090
In formation, go!
LAURA: I'm going to prepare

855
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:57.430
Spirit Guardians the minute I see any movement.

856
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.263
MATT: Okay.

857
00:36:58.263 --> 00:37:00.370
You begin casting Spirit Guardians

858
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.180
LAURA: To release as soon as we see anything.

859
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.580
MATT: Okay, as you guys continue stepping forward,

860
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.920
Caduceus, out of the corner of your eye,

861
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.340
you look across one of the banks.

862
00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.710
For a split second, you look over,

863
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.891
you begin to feel this slight rumble in the ground.

864
00:37:14.891 --> 00:37:17.160
(rumbling) You look up

865
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.110
in the direction of the first snow bank

866
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.980
and you see the bristled fur of the large wolf

867
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.470
there as it pulls back, snarling.

868
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.550
TALIESIN: I cast Blindness.
(growling)

869
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.740
MATT: You cast Blindness?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

870
00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.170
MATT: All right, so you release Blindness.

871
00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:31.160
You see it leap, too, as he casts the spell.

872
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.550
You look over.

873
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.910
What's the DC on that?

874
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.012
TALIESIN: Constitution 17.

875
00:37:37.012 --> 00:37:38.330
MATT: Constitution 17, natural 19.

876
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.700
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.
[gasping]

877
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.470
MATT: Unfortunately, it leaps in the air.

878
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:44.530
The spell has no effect and there is a spray of white snow

879
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.340
as emerging from the ground beneath it (booming)

880
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.400
you see a flash of blue and white.

881
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.490
You see numerous, spiny legs emerge

882
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.340
from the snow and earth beneath

883
00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:59.100
as a large, serpentine, almost centipede-like creature

884
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.160
bursts from beneath the ice and snow

885
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.124
and devours the wolf whole in one bite.

886
00:38:04.124 --> 00:38:05.810
[yelling]

887
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:10.030
SAM: We're winning!
[laughter]

888
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.290
LAURA: I turn around and look back at our tracks.

889
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.320
Oh, shit.
[laughter]

890
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.586
MATT: It turns back towards you,

891
00:38:16.586 --> 00:38:18.960
these large, insectoid eyes,

892
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.560
at its current length standing about 10 feet above,

893
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.510
its large maw glistening, clacking

894
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.610
as its mandibles pull back in,

895
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.100
its numerous arms and legs clicking around its body.

896
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.075
It spins around to look at you with these large antenna.

897
00:38:32.075 --> 00:38:34.410
(gurgling)

898
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.610
Everyone roll initiative.

899
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.110
(yelling)

900
00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:43.208
TRAVIS: Oh fuck!

901
00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:45.699
MARISHA: Oh, Captain, my Captain.

902
00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:47.607
TRAVIS: Fuck!

903
00:38:49.106 --> 00:38:51.960
SAM: Oh, I don't have my helmet--
LAURA: Wait, but I cast

904
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.144
Spiritual Guardians.
SAM: This combat

905
00:38:54.144 --> 00:38:56.330
is powered by Dwarven Forge.

906
00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.140
They've just launched Plaguestone,

907
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.070
a new line of Pathfinder 2 sets.

908
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.120
Go check it out now, Dwarven Forge.

909
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.090
Oh my god (laughs).
[laughter]

910
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:09.493
Whoa, cool camera angle!

911
00:39:09.493 --> 00:39:11.520
[laughter]

912
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.420
TALIESIN: Does Jester get a Spirit Guardian cast pre-roll?

913
00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.090
MATT: Yes, you do, as a reaction, you do.

914
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.350
TALIESIN: Bless you.

915
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.350
SAM: Oh, nice.

916
00:39:19.922 --> 00:39:20.755
MATT: All right, I'm going to get over here

917
00:39:20.755 --> 00:39:23.540
to some proper battle music, thank you.

918
00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.520
LAURA: Why does it keep doing this?

919
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.750
MATT: There is one wolf, who is hiding behind here.

920
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:33.160
You can just hear it react and then

921
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.960
on this end, you see where the creature had just

922
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.470
risen past here and devoured the wolf.

923
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.150
TRAVIS: Fuck that thing!
MATT: In one leap.

924
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.770
TRAVIS: I want the wolf instead.
[laughter]

925
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:48.640
MATT: All righty, so.

926
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.140
Initiatives, 25 to 20.

927
00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.685
SAM: 23!

928
00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:59.650
MATT: 23, we have Nott.

929
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:00.660
MATT: 20

930
00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.200
to 15?
LAURA: 19.

931
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.479
TRAVIS: 17.
MARISHA: 15.

932
00:40:07.479 --> 00:40:10.319
MATT: All right, so we have 19 for Jester.

933
00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:11.760
LAURA: Yes.

934
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.220
MATT: 17 for Beauregard.
TRAVIS: 17 for Fjord.

935
00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.720
MATT: Sorry, for Fjord.
MARISHA: 15 for Beau.

936
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.920
MATT: All right, 15 to 10?

937
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.190
TALIESIN: 13.
LIAM: 12.

938
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:24.670
MATT: All right, and we have--

939
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.483
TRAVIS: We're just getting right into this shit.

940
00:40:26.483 --> 00:40:28.213
[cheering]

941
00:40:28.213 --> 00:40:30.048
SAM: I'm just looking at the map.

942
00:40:30.048 --> 00:40:32.539
LAURA: Stop it!
[laughter]

943
00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:35.590
SAM: Just looking at the map!
[laughter]

944
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.562
LAURA: Oh, it's really hard.

945
00:40:36.562 --> 00:40:38.530
MATT: No, no, no!

946
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.880
Twitch TOS, Sam, come on.

947
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.920
LAURA: It hurt my finger.

948
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.503
LIAM: ♪ Copa Cabana! ♪

949
00:40:49.487 --> 00:40:51.810
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.
MATT: All right.

950
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:53.670
Nott, you're up first.

951
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:57.540
SAM: Okay, I'm going to run full speed about 30 feet,

952
00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.957
flanking all of us, you pick a direction.

953
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.830
MATT: Like around this way?
SAM: Yeah, perfect.

954
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.630
MATT: All right, so five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.

955
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.230
SAM: Sure, and then the last five feet, I'm going to like,

956
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.660
like a hockey stop, like sort of a deep slide,

957
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.390
so I want the snow to cover me

958
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:20.190
and I'm going to bonus action hide under it.

959
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.770
MATT: I will say because you're small enough

960
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.480
and there is enough snow from the storm last night,

961
00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.461
I'll allow it, go ahead and roll a stealth check.

962
00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:28.930
[cheering]

963
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:32.140
SAM: 28!
[cheering]

964
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:35.410
MATT: A unique element of this.

965
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.550
As you run through the snow, because of your ring,

966
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:42.830
I'll say the snow is not quite as difficult to get through

967
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.780
as you thought it would be, which is nice.

968
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.388
So you get your full movement.
SAM: Nice.

969
00:41:47.388 --> 00:41:48.950
MATT: What was your stealth check again, it was--

970
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.430
SAM: 28, stealth.

971
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:52.790
MATT: You just skid and (poofs)

972
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.250
vanish into the snowbank.

973
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.750
SAM: And cock my pistolera

974
00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.420
and I fire, hoping that I'm hidden.

975
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.800
MATT: All righty, go for it.

976
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.050
SAM: Do I get advantage, no?

977
00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.470
MATT: Go ahead and I'll say yes, you do.

978
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.861
SAM: Yeah.

979
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.840
Okay, 24 to hit.

980
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.700
MATT: That definitely hits, roll damage.

981
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.319
[cheering]

982
00:42:17.319 --> 00:42:21.170
SAM: Oh, doctor!
[laughter]

983
00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.562
I'll use Fury of the Small, 40 points of damage!

984
00:42:28.562 --> 00:42:31.562
[cheering]

985
00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:36.590
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!
MATT: Rogues, man.

986
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.090
All righty.

987
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.880
As it turns, it watches and tracks you

988
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.190
as you spin into the snow and vanish,

989
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.300
it begins to look around and its weird,

990
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.004
insect-like face going (clicking),

991
00:42:47.004 --> 00:42:48.150
right in one of its eyes (whooshes),

992
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.950
the splash of blue gore out of one side of its face

993
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.900
as it rears back (gurgling).

994
00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.010
That's your turn, I believe, right?

995
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.662
SAM: Oh, yes.
MATT: All right.

996
00:42:57.662 --> 00:43:01.486
The ground begins to shake once more, this time heavier.

997
00:43:01.486 --> 00:43:03.460
And larger.
TRAVIS: No.

998
00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:08.190
MATT: (whooshing) You all turn around

999
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:12.040
and, behind you, right in front of Caleb and Jester,

1000
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.560
the ground explodes and one of the nearby rocks

1001
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.430
gets pushed off to the side

1002
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.039
as you realize the one that you noticed

1003
00:43:18.039 --> 00:43:22.040
may have been the child.
(gasping)

1004
00:43:25.834 --> 00:43:27.870
If I can figure out where I dropped the thing.

1005
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.240
Of course.

1006
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.310
SAM: Bring out the monster!
MATT: There it is.

1007
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.840
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ.
MARISHA: (groans)

1008
00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.670
LAURA: No!
[cheering]

1009
00:43:40.964 --> 00:43:45.039
MATT: As it does, oh god, as it does so, the rock tips over,

1010
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:46.855
rolls off, and actually knocks this tree

1011
00:43:46.855 --> 00:43:49.500
onto the side there.

1012
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.917
TALIESIN: Good save, good save.

1013
00:43:51.917 --> 00:43:55.010
MATT: So this entity, now standing tall

1014
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.580
at about 15 or so feet, its body much larger,

1015
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.900
the armor thicker, its eyes much more angry,

1016
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.216
spins around, shifts towards

1017
00:44:06.216 --> 00:44:09.390
Jester, Beauregard, and Caleb,

1018
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.640
and it's going to make a bite attack against--

1019
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.370
LAURA: Wouldn't it get, wait, doesn't it get attacked

1020
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.510
by my Spiritual Guardian?
MATT: It does, actually.

1021
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:18.050
Go ahead, and what's the wisdom save on that?

1022
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.940
LAURA: Wisdom save 17.

1023
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.610
MATT: 17.

1024
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.520
Natural two, no, it does not save,

1025
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.570
go ahead and roll damage.
[cheering]

1026
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.670
TRAVIS: Come on, hamster unicorns!

1027
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:30.120
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1028
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.790
Oh, wait, that's four of them, hold on, I only get three.

1029
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:37.320
Seven plus eight is 15.

1030
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.211
MATT: 15 points of damage against it, nice.

1031
00:44:40.211 --> 00:44:41.600
So as it emerges, suddenly (whooshes),

1032
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.720
it's splashed and assaulted by a cloud of

1033
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.417
angry little temporal unicorns,

1034
00:44:47.417 --> 00:44:49.810
begin spearing it with their tiny horns.

1035
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.610
As it looks back to you (gurgling)

1036
00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.050
and it's going to attack you.

1037
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.170
LAURA: How does it--
MATT: You were the first to hurt.

1038
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.770
LAURA: How do they know it's from me?

1039
00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:00.260
MATT: You're just too adorable.
LAURA: (groans)

1040
00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.260
You seem to be the source of where they're swirling.

1041
00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.035
MARISHA: Sentinel attack.

1042
00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:06.522
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!
MATT: Yeah.

1043
00:45:06.522 --> 00:45:09.450
Go for it.
TRAVIS: Get that shit.

1044
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.306
SAM: Guys, we're getting good at this.

1045
00:45:11.306 --> 00:45:13.000
[laughter]

1046
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.950
I don't think anyone's going to die this session.

1047
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.190
MARISHA: 14.
[laughter]

1048
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.840
Tell me I hit it, 14.

1049
00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.780
MATT: 14 does not hit.

1050
00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.940
You swing with your staff and as you hit its armor,

1051
00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.960
as much as the insectoid carapace on the bottom

1052
00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.620
looks like it's a little fleshy,

1053
00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:34.453
it's harder than you thought

1054
00:45:34.453 --> 00:45:36.390
and it just bounces off with no impact.

1055
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:40.423
As it bites down toward Jester, with a

1056
00:45:40.423 --> 00:45:42.156
22 to hit.

1057
00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:43.535
LAURA: Oh, that hits.

1058
00:45:43.535 --> 00:45:45.130
MATT: I think that hits your armor class, yeah.

1059
00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:48.630
All right, so you, as it bites into you,

1060
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.196
you take--

1061
00:45:51.196 --> 00:45:53.569
I've got to get all the d10s here.

1062
00:45:53.569 --> 00:45:56.150
[gasping]

1063
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.320
TALIESIN: Don't want to look.
MARISHA: 10s, 10s across the board.

1064
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.340
MATT: All right.

1065
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.730
Ooh.
SAM: 6d10s?

1066
00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:07.340
MATT: Okay, that's not good.

1067
00:46:09.422 --> 00:46:11.650
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lord have Mercer!

1068
00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:13.854
MATT: You take 43 points of piercing damage.

1069
00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:16.240
[gasping]

1070
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.103
Plus--
SAM: Plus?!

1071
00:46:18.103 --> 00:46:20.603
MATT: Nine points of fire damage.

1072
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:24.530
As cold as it looks on the exterior,

1073
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:28.350
there is a burning heat from inside its mouth and body

1074
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.490
and immediately, just having its open mouth clamp onto you,

1075
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.310
it's singeing you by proximity.

1076
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.570
You are also grappled.

1077
00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:39.003
MARISHA: What?!

1078
00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.700
MATT: While you're grappled, you are restrained.

1079
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.400
You guys watch as Jester is bit by it

1080
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.680
and it lifts its head up and Jester is now,

1081
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.300
her legs peeking and kicking out of its mouth

1082
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.822
like Audrey at the end of "Little Shop of Horrors."

1083
00:46:53.822 --> 00:46:56.730
[laughter]

1084
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:00.370
It rears up and her feet are about 10 feet above you.

1085
00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:01.880
That ends its turn, Jester, your turn.

1086
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.180
LAURA: (muffled) Help me!

1087
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.142
MATT: I also need you to make a constitution

1088
00:47:05.142 --> 00:47:08.120
saving throw for concentration, please.

1089
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.350
MARISHA: Save the unicorns.

1090
00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:15.960
SAM: Save the world.

1091
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.050
LAURA: Why, it's so weird!

1092
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.070
Oh, my dice are just so crazy.

1093
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.080
12 plus constitution?

1094
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.960
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: 14.

1095
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.460
MATT: 14, unfortunately, the unicorns fade.

1096
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.760
The damage was too much and as you struggle

1097
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.300
and squeeze around in the mouth of this giant creature,

1098
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.670
you lose the spell, however, it is your turn.

1099
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:35.680
What would you like to do?

1100
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.710
Right now it is just near darkness

1101
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.810
as the top half of your body is in the process

1102
00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:42.960
of being chewed by this creature.

1103
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.820
LAURA: Um, I'm going to, oh jeebies, wait.

1104
00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.535
Can I cast anything?
MATT: Yeah.

1105
00:47:49.535 --> 00:47:52.090
You're just restrained.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1106
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:57.040
I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds

1107
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.390
from inside of it.
MATT: Okay.

1108
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:04.210
LAURA: I'm going to cast it at 4th-level.

1109
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.320
[cheering]

1110
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.340
MATT: Okay.

1111
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.770
Because you are restrained, the attack is a disadvantage,

1112
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:12.850
however, you are inside its mouth,

1113
00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:15.400
I'll just say roll, a straight roll,

1114
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.093
I won't give you disadvantage because it's hard to

1115
00:48:18.093 --> 00:48:19.540
really miss it, you're just trying to

1116
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:20.930
pierce its armor right now.

1117
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.363
LAURA: Okay, hold on, let me cast this.

1118
00:48:24.418 --> 00:48:25.442
Okay.

1119
00:48:25.442 --> 00:48:26.342
SAM: This is fun.

1120
00:48:26.342 --> 00:48:29.060
LAURA: This is so much fun, you guys!

1121
00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.470
Okay, okay.

1122
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.915
Vomit.
SAM: Big dice, big dice.

1123
00:48:34.915 --> 00:48:37.310
LAURA: Plus-- 19.

1124
00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:40.880
MATT: 19 hits.
[cheering]

1125
00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:43.663
LAURA: Okay.

1126
00:48:43.663 --> 00:48:44.496
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

1127
00:48:44.496 --> 00:48:45.550
LAURA: 6d10.

1128
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.313
MATT: Fjord, you're on deck.

1129
00:48:47.313 --> 00:48:49.111
[cheering]

1130
00:48:49.111 --> 00:48:51.520
SAM: How many?
LAURA: 6d10.

1131
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.944
MATT: 6d10 necrotic damage.
LAURA: Yeah.

1132
00:48:54.944 --> 00:48:57.200
Okay.
TALIESIN: You need more or you good?

1133
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.590
LAURA: I can't believe I need extra dice, hold on.

1134
00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:04.110
How many is that, one, two, three, four, five.

1135
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:09.110
18 plus nine is 27 plus five is,

1136
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:14.470
plus nine is 41 plus one more.

1137
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.270
One, 42.

1138
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:17.873
MATT: 42 points of necrotic damage.

1139
00:49:17.873 --> 00:49:20.890
[cheering]

1140
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:23.830
You feel the muscles constrict and pull and it,

1141
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:25.940
it hurts, but you know,

1142
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.620
you enjoy the fact that it's hurting so badly as well.

1143
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.480
The rest of you watch as you freak out

1144
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.900
watching Jester get brought up

1145
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.990
and lifted off the ground, legs kicking,

1146
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:35.700
its throat suddenly goes dark.

1147
00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.380
You watch as veins across its body

1148
00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.290
pulse black down the sides of its throat

1149
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.320
and it begins to thrash around in pain

1150
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.650
as the flesh around the area

1151
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:45.150
where Jester is currently being latched in with its jaw,

1152
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:48.387
it seems to be rotting before your eyes.

1153
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.120
Is that the end of your turn?

1154
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.930
LAURA: I guess so, yeah.

1155
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:57.381
As a bonus action, I'm going to kick my legs really hard.

1156
00:49:57.381 --> 00:50:00.100
MATT: All right, you do so.

1157
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.390
Fjord, you're up, Beau, you're on deck.

1158
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:05.208
LAURA: I'm going to do some synchronized swimming moves.

1159
00:50:05.208 --> 00:50:07.057
[laughter]

1160
00:50:07.057 --> 00:50:08.020
MATT: (laughs) Perfect.

1161
00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.810
TRAVIS: Jester is still in its mouth?

1162
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.288
MATT: Yes, just grappled and held up in its jaw.

1163
00:50:12.288 --> 00:50:13.690
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1164
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.710
I will use my 30 feet of movement

1165
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:17.150
to move out towards the sides.

1166
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:18.860
Since we're all in a nice little group

1167
00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.840
here right in the middle and as I run by,

1168
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.287
I will take a swipe with my Dagger of Denial.

1169
00:50:25.287 --> 00:50:27.930
[cheering]
MATT: (chuckles)

1170
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.580
Go for it, that would put you,

1171
00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.140
nah, you're not quite flanking with it,

1172
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.465
so you just do a regular attack roll.

1173
00:50:33.465 --> 00:50:35.740
TRAVIS: I'm going to do a swipe as I run by and try and--

1174
00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.270
MATT: Go for it, go for it.

1175
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:40.280
SAM: The dagger is trolling him (laughs).

1176
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.710
TRAVIS: That is a 22 to hit.

1177
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:47.607
MATT: That hits, wow.
[applause]

1178
00:50:47.607 --> 00:50:49.260
Nice roll.

1179
00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.778
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't get too excited, 1d4.

1180
00:50:51.778 --> 00:50:53.410
[laughter]

1181
00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:57.300
Hey, six!
[cheering]

1182
00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:01.110
MATT: Six points of piercing damage to the creature,

1183
00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:02.910
as you rush by with your dagger (whooshes),

1184
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.216
like Naruto stab across the side.

1185
00:51:05.216 --> 00:51:06.420
[laughter]

1186
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.630
TRAVIS: Coming, Jester, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1187
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.130
MATT: Awesome.

1188
00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:13.580
You also--
LAURA: Somebody get me out of there

1189
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.630
before--
MATT: Take

1190
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:20.150
15 points of fire damage.
[gasping]

1191
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.820
As you strike across it and open a wound,

1192
00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.550
the heat that emanates from its body is so strong

1193
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.460
that it scalds the side of your face

1194
00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.975
and Jester, as a reminder, too, when you did attack it,

1195
00:51:29.975 --> 00:51:34.975
you also did take 13 points of fire damage.

1196
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.780
I needed to remember that.

1197
00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.250
From the heat inside of its body,

1198
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.330
it is like a burning furnace on the inside of this large,

1199
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.160
blue centipede-like creature.
MARISHA: Your face.

1200
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:44.993
Oh no.

1201
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:49.709
LAURA: I'm super close.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

1202
00:51:49.709 --> 00:51:51.527
SAM: I take back what I said before.

1203
00:51:51.527 --> 00:51:53.220
[laughter]

1204
00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.720
Someone's going to die.

1205
00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.020
LAURA: Ah, man, are you going to kill me

1206
00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.860
at the very beginning of the show?

1207
00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.512
What am I going to do?

1208
00:52:00.512 --> 00:52:02.412
MATT: Oh, I'm sorry.

1209
00:52:02.412 --> 00:52:03.303
Beau, you're up.

1210
00:52:03.303 --> 00:52:05.800
MATT: All right, I am going to turn around

1211
00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.510
and I'm going to kick off of the tree behind me

1212
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.020
and parkour off and I'm going to use that

1213
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:13.480
and do a big swinging Iron Man, Superman punch

1214
00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.780
to its lobster fucking face.

1215
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.820
MATT: You go for it.

1216
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.300
Go ahead and make an acrobatics check for me.

1217
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.133
MARISHA: Copy.

1218
00:52:23.841 --> 00:52:25.630
Yeah, 21.

1219
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:26.580
MATT: 21.

1220
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.463
You run, jump, and run up the side of the tree,

1221
00:52:29.463 --> 00:52:31.750
vertically leaping off, and as you spin in the air,

1222
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:32.583
come down for the strike,

1223
00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:33.700
I'll give you advantage on the attack

1224
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.549
because of that acrobatics check.

1225
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:37.213
[cheering]

1226
00:52:37.213 --> 00:52:40.170
MARISHA: Okay!

1227
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:42.258
Thank God, because one's a natural one.

1228
00:52:42.258 --> 00:52:46.291
The other is a 17 plus 10, so 27.

1229
00:52:46.291 --> 00:52:49.570
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1230
00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:50.980
MARISHA: 10 damage.

1231
00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.600
MATT: 10 damage, all right.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

1232
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:56.000
MATT: Stunning Strike.

1233
00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:57.830
15.

1234
00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:01.090
What's your DC?
MARISHA: 15?

1235
00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:04.260
MATT: It succeeds, sorry.
MARISHA: Fucking ballsacks.

1236
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.020
MATT: The first strike, as you slam down,

1237
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.600
it takes it, but it seems to shrug it off,

1238
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.850
no effect beyond the damage it sustained.

1239
00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:10.870
MARISHA: Second attack, I'm going to,

1240
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.300
as I'm using my momentum to swing down,

1241
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.820
I'm going to come around with a knee to the face

1242
00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.770
or abdomen or I don't know, whatever.

1243
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:18.603
MATT: All righty.

1244
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:22.870
MARISHA: 19.

1245
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:24.690
MATT: 19 hits.
MARISHA: 11 damage.

1246
00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:25.580
MATT: 11 points of damage.

1247
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:26.510
MARISHA: Stunning Strike!

1248
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:28.700
MATT: Stunning Strike again.

1249
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.946
Natural 18. I'm sorry.

1250
00:53:31.946 --> 00:53:33.500
It's rolling really well.

1251
00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.670
MARISHA: Okay.

1252
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.050
Flurry of Blows.

1253
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.330
Pop-pop!
MATT: Go for it.

1254
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:41.800
So you leap up, the first hit, you grab on

1255
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.480
and mount yourself onto the back of its head

1256
00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.340
and just start pummeling it from above, go for it.

1257
00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:47.660
MARISHA: First attack.

1258
00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.200
MATT: Currently now affixed to its body there.

1259
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.050
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, 28.

1260
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:52.883
MATT: 28 hits.

1261
00:53:52.883 --> 00:53:56.700
MARISHA: And nine damage.
MATT: All righty.

1262
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.667
Nine.

1263
00:53:57.667 --> 00:54:00.475
AUDIENCE: Nein!

1264
00:54:00.475 --> 00:54:03.310
[laughter]

1265
00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:04.760
MARISHA: Jester's looking bad.

1266
00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:09.440
First, I hit with a Flurry of Blows, Extract Aspects.

1267
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.980
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Order of operations.

1268
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.540
I'm trying to keep them all in my head.

1269
00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.860
MATT: All right, you understand this creature

1270
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:21.123
is immune to cold and fire damage.

1271
00:54:21.123 --> 00:54:22.270
[gasping]

1272
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:26.120
SAM: That seems contradictory.
[laughter]

1273
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.750
MATT: Welcome to D&amp;D.

1274
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:32.011
MARISHA: That's it?

1275
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.480
MATT: Yes, and as this information comes to you,

1276
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.020
you're like, huh, how is it immune to fire damage?

1277
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:37.920
You look at your fists

1278
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.570
and they're scalding from the impact.

1279
00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:44.100
You take, from the first hit, nine points of fire damage.

1280
00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.218
MARISHA: Nine!

1281
00:54:45.218 --> 00:54:46.837
MATT: The second hit you inflicted

1282
00:54:46.837 --> 00:54:48.583
another nine points of fire damage.

1283
00:54:48.583 --> 00:54:50.110
SAM and AUDIENCE: Nein!

1284
00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:52.810
MATT: The third hit, another nine points of fire damage.

1285
00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:56.164
AUDIENCE: Nein!

1286
00:54:56.164 --> 00:54:57.740
MATT: Go ahead and roll your fourth and final attack.

1287
00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:58.974
MARISHA: All right, yes.

1288
00:54:58.974 --> 00:55:01.700
TRAVIS: That's a lot of damage just from punching it.

1289
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.160
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1290
00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.920
LIAM: <i>Das tut mir leid.</i>

1291
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.910
MARISHA: Okay.

1292
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.980
Oh, 15.
MATT: 15 does not hit.

1293
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:16.360
MARISHA: Okay, no Stunning Strike.
MATT: Do you wish to remain

1294
00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.760
on the back of the creature?

1295
00:55:21.479 --> 00:55:23.100
[laughter]

1296
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.290
You're currently riding on its head,

1297
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:25.960
clutching the back of its spine.

1298
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.420
MARISHA: How close is Jester from the--

1299
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.950
MATT: She's about five feet from you.

1300
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.500
MARISHA: I'll stay on the back.

1301
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.490
MATT: Okay.
[cheering]

1302
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.590
That finishes Beau's go, now it's the wolf's turn.

1303
00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:38.360
The wolf is going to run the fuck away.

1304
00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.090
[laughter]

1305
00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:42.410
It is out.

1306
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:44.403
LAURA: We should maybe follow suit.

1307
00:55:44.403 --> 00:55:47.120
SAM: Smartest creature in the campaign.

1308
00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.600
MATT: Mother nature, for some reason,

1309
00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.300
has a good instinct for these things.

1310
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.930
Speaking of which, Caduceus, you're up.

1311
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:55.840
TALIESIN: Motherfudger.

1312
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.175
Okay, there's not a lot I can do to help here.

1313
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:02.549
You look like you just, you just got kind of,

1314
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:05.570
yeah, I don't want you to drop too low, too fast,

1315
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:10.570
so I'm going to do a Healing Word

1316
00:56:11.378 --> 00:56:14.360
at-- let me pick a level.

1317
00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.570
It won't be a ton, but it'll help at 3rd-level.

1318
00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:18.750
MATT: All right, so 3d4 plus--

1319
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.050
TALIESIN: 3d4 plus five.
MATT: Plus five.

1320
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:21.280
Go ahead and roll that.
TALIESIN: Not the best,

1321
00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.122
but it'll help.
MATT: As Caduceus reaches up and

1322
00:56:23.122 --> 00:56:26.070
shouts out a magical word of encouragement and healing

1323
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.250
towards Jester in the creature's mouth.

1324
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.160
TALIESIN: Oh, that's so terrible.

1325
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.493
11 points of, 11 points up.
LAURA: Tight.

1326
00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.790
TALIESIN: Taking it and my bonus actions

1327
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.290
just suck in this, don't they?

1328
00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.030
MATT: But Healing Word is a bonus action,

1329
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:43.170
so you have your action.
LAURA: Back to double digits,

1330
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.030
that's good.
MATT: You have your action still.

1331
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:46.280
TALIESIN: Oh, that was my bonus action?

1332
00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.680
MATT: Healing Word is bonus, yeah.
TALIESIN: Is bonus,

1333
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.720
but for action-wise, though, I can't cast a spell.

1334
00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:51.900
MATT: You can cast a cantrip.

1335
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:55.010
TALIESIN: I can cast a cantrip, okay, that'll do.

1336
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:57.060
That's right, I'm learning how this works.

1337
00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:59.180
It's only been so long.

1338
00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.343
I'm going to,

1339
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.725
no, that doesn't work, I'm going to cast,

1340
00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.170
I suppose Sacred Flame because that's what I got right now.

1341
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.084
MATT: All right, is that a dexterity-saving throw?

1342
00:57:11.084 --> 00:57:14.010
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame is a dex saving throw.

1343
00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:16.150
MATT: All right, that is going to be a 10.

1344
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.983
I believe that's a failure.

1345
00:57:16.983 --> 00:57:18.775
TALIESIN: That is a failure.
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

1346
00:57:18.775 --> 00:57:20.940
[cheering]

1347
00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:22.770
LAURA: That's good, so that's radiant damage, right?

1348
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:23.603
That's not--
TALIESIN: That's radiant.

1349
00:57:23.603 --> 00:57:25.322
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's good, that's good.

1350
00:57:25.322 --> 00:57:27.830
TALIESIN: That's not bad.

1351
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:30.092
14 points of radiant damage.

1352
00:57:30.092 --> 00:57:33.571
MATT: Nice.

1353
00:57:33.571 --> 00:57:34.836
(whooshes) The fire burns across it.

1354
00:57:34.836 --> 00:57:36.000
You're starting to see now,

1355
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.350
it's looking like it's taking some damage.

1356
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:40.540
It's still strong, still standing without issue,

1357
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.350
but you can see there's some wear and tear.

1358
00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:45.130
The one that Nott shot earlier

1359
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.600
also is seeing some wear and tear.

1360
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.430
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm just going to hold my,

1361
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:52.300
I'm going to just try and stay in between the two.

1362
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.730
MATT: Okay, so you're staying put?

1363
00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:56.050
TALIESIN: Yeah, sure.
MATT: All right.

1364
00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:59.520
MARISHA: Also, Matt, do I have time for Beau to be like:

1365
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.790
Avoid fire and ice (groans).

1366
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:03.450
George R.R. Martin--
MARISHA: Beau just shouting

1367
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.710
at the top of it, swinging, "No fire and ice!"

1368
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:07.403
MARISHA: Yeah!

1369
00:58:07.403 --> 00:58:09.473
SAM: It was a great book!

1370
00:58:09.473 --> 00:58:13.030
[laughter]

1371
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:14.310
MATT: You got it, all right, Caleb.

1372
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:16.790
LIAM: Caleb, he had an idea,

1373
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:17.920
but he just starts rapidly

1374
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.340
going through the spells he knows.

1375
00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:21.700
This, no, this, no, this, no, this, no!

1376
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.220
He sees his dear little blue friend looking rough

1377
00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:28.470
and pulls out a cocoon and casts Polymorph

1378
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:30.746
and turns her into a mammoth.

1379
00:58:30.746 --> 00:58:33.746
[cheering]

1380
00:58:35.584 --> 00:58:38.167
LAURA: (laughs)

1381
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:42.437
LIAM: Sending you the stats!

1382
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:48.700
And I'm backing the hell away from this monstrosity.

1383
00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:51.338
This way.
MATT: All right.

1384
00:58:51.338 --> 00:58:52.930
I didn't bring my mammoth mini

1385
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:55.520
because I wasn't expecting that.

1386
00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.060
We'll just use the wolf for it

1387
00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.080
and consider it a bit larger.

1388
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:02.700
You watch as the jaws suddenly distend

1389
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.560
and snap, almost, as Jester's body begins to swell

1390
00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.830
and grow brown fur, the armor seems to protrude

1391
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:12.520
and expand until it becomes this extremely

1392
00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.886
deep-brown, furry, just a hunk of flesh and muscle

1393
00:59:15.886 --> 00:59:19.193
before it spits her out instinctually.

1394
00:59:19.193 --> 00:59:22.193
[cheering]

1395
00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:27.280
Knocking this tree over into the other one.

1396
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.320
LAURA: Yeah!

1397
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:33.210
MATT: Which it does not make its dexterity-saving throw,

1398
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.240
so it takes an additional three points of bludgeoning damage

1399
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.790
from the tree slamming into it.

1400
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.630
The tree tumbles over there onto the ground.

1401
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:41.880
All right, you're a mammoth now.

1402
00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.080
LIAM: Caleb will move his full movement, 30 feet this way,

1403
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.710
going: <i>Schnell, schnell, schnell, schnell.</i>

1404
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:48.130
MATT: This way?

1405
00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:50.850
LIAM: Diagonally this way, DM.

1406
00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:52.750
MATT: All right, as you rush back, the creature,

1407
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.600
now having its jaws freed,

1408
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.215
is going to make an attack of opportunity against you.

1409
00:59:56.215 --> 00:59:57.920
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

1410
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:02.000
MATT: That is going to be a 15 to hit.

1411
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.197
LIAM: Shield.

1412
01:00:03.197 --> 01:00:06.420
MATT: Shield, all righty.
[cheering]

1413
01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.720
You guys watch as after Jester is expelled from its mouth,

1414
01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.470
the creature turns around and (growling)

1415
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:14.790
lunges like a snake, snapping towards Caleb

1416
01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:17.600
as he runs and (whooshes) throws up his shield.

1417
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.240
Its jaws snap out to consume him and (whooshes)

1418
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.620
get reflected from the arcane shield,

1419
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.830
bouncing backward, its head withdraws back,

1420
01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:25.680
and it gets its bearings

1421
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.450
after its head took the impact.

1422
01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:30.820
LIAM: <i>Scheiße</i> (groans).

1423
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.930
MATT: That gets you about there.

1424
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.030
All right, that finishes your turn, Caleb.

1425
01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.970
It is now the younger one's turn.

1426
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.150
Younger one.
TRAVIS: Fuck you.

1427
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:44.730
MATT: It's going to go ahead and--

1428
01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.640
Let's see here, yeah.

1429
01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.148
It's going to spin around to this direction.

1430
01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:51.981
It's going to go ahead and

1431
01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.304
bite down towards you, Nott.
(Sam yells)

1432
01:00:54.304 --> 01:00:55.137
Because you were the one that

1433
01:00:55.137 --> 01:00:56.240
shot the hell out of it last turn.

1434
01:00:57.371 --> 01:00:58.971
SAM: (yells)
MATT: That is going to be

1435
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.110
a 21 to hit?
SAM: Hits!

1436
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:04.660
MATT: All right.

1437
01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.570
It bites down towards you,

1438
01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:09.107
its fangs and jaws sinking into you.

1439
01:01:09.107 --> 01:01:10.440
All right, that's a really good roll.

1440
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.015
10, nine, and a four.

1441
01:01:12.015 --> 01:01:16.637
That is 27 points of piercing damage.

1442
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.110
Plus eight points of fire damage as its jaws bite into you.

1443
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.620
It begins to drag you back a bit.

1444
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.430
You can feel the inner heat from its mouth and throat

1445
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:28.760
burning, singeing the back of your body as you pull free.

1446
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.900
It does not have you grappled.

1447
01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.330
SAM: Uncanny dodge.

1448
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:33.005
MATT: All right, so you take half the damage then.

1449
01:01:33.005 --> 01:01:36.005
[cheering]

1450
01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:38.640
That ends its turn.

1451
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.780
Nott, your go.

1452
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.520
SAM: Am I in its jaws?

1453
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.790
MATT: No, it has not grappled you.

1454
01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:45.800
SAM: Oh, thank goodness.

1455
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.920
If I run, it will kill me.

1456
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.528
So I don't want to do that.

1457
01:01:51.528 --> 01:01:54.156
Oh, man, this is a predicament.

1458
01:01:54.156 --> 01:01:56.823
(Travis laughs)

1459
01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:00.620
Shit, shit, shit!

1460
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.640
I will run--

1461
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.360
nope, I'm just going to sit right in front of it,

1462
01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.268
plop down in the snow, and just go, ping!

1463
01:02:11.268 --> 01:02:13.690
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for an attack, then.

1464
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:15.180
SAM: Shit, that's not good either,

1465
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.297
because I won't get a sneak attack, it's not worth it!

1466
01:02:18.297 --> 01:02:20.110
MATT: What are you doing?
SAM: Fuck, shitballs!

1467
01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:21.530
I'm going to run!
MATT: Okay.

1468
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:22.860
SAM: I got to run.
MATT: All right.

1469
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.410
You go ahead and start running which direction?

1470
01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:25.980
LAURA: Run at a zig zag.

1471
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.579
SAM: Yeah, serpentine, serpentine!

1472
01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:29.680
MATT: Zigging around here!

1473
01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.200
All right.
(Laura laughs)

1474
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.070
Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.

1475
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.190
That gets you about there.

1476
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:36.023
As you rush past it,

1477
01:02:36.023 --> 01:02:37.450
it does get an attack of opportunity on you.

1478
01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.090
It attempts to bite out once again.

1479
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:41.070
LAURA: At disadvantage because of the zig zag!

1480
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:44.150
MATT: No.
[laughter]

1481
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:45.390
That is a 24 to hit.

1482
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.030
23, 23.
SAM: Hits!

1483
01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.910
MATT: I'm rolling really well tonight.

1484
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:52.419
TALIESIN: Stop it!
MATT: No, it's fun for me.

1485
01:02:52.419 --> 01:02:54.110
[laughter]

1486
01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:54.943
All right.

1487
01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:59.820
18 plus four, 22 points of piercing damage.

1488
01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:00.960
SAM: Damn.
LAURA: Oh no.

1489
01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.440
MATT: Plus 10 points of fire damage.

1490
01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.686
SAM: Damn!

1491
01:03:03.686 --> 01:03:05.050
MATT: So 32 points of damage to you.

1492
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.840
SAM: Damn!

1493
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.070
I'll use my bonus action to somehow, like,

1494
01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:14.676
jump into the tree and hide!

1495
01:03:14.676 --> 01:03:17.660
Maybe?
[laughter]

1496
01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.980
MATT: Make an acrobatics check for me.

1497
01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.813
SAM: Okay.

1498
01:03:19.813 --> 01:03:21.196
MATT: With disadvantage because you just got

1499
01:03:21.196 --> 01:03:24.338
the fuck bitten out of you.

1500
01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:25.810
SAM: Oh, not good.

1501
01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:27.250
13.

1502
01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:30.330
MATT: 13, okay, you scramble up part of the tree.

1503
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:32.720
You think you may or may not be

1504
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.120
far enough into its branches.

1505
01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.560
You're using a stealth check for your bonus action.

1506
01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.393
SAM: Yeah.

1507
01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:38.900
MATT: Make a stealth check with disadvantage

1508
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.710
because you've just barely scampered up.

1509
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:44.368
SAM: Okay, 22.
MATT: 22.

1510
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:47.950
Even hurting and ow, ow, ow, rushing your way up there

1511
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:49.400
and climbing up the tree and slipping in,

1512
01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.960
climbing up more, you think you're still pretty well hidden.

1513
01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.461
So I think that's your turn there.

1514
01:03:55.461 --> 01:03:57.869
SAM: No, I haven't done my action.

1515
01:03:58.846 --> 01:03:59.679
MATT: Oh, that's right, because you didn't attack it,

1516
01:03:59.679 --> 01:04:00.580
you didn't shoot it, so, yeah, take your action.

1517
01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.410
SAM: Now I will shoot it and hope that I'm hidden.

1518
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:04.243
MATT: All right.

1519
01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.354
[cheering]

1520
01:04:09.354 --> 01:04:12.260
So you are currently up in the tree.

1521
01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:14.340
SAM: 21 to hit.
MATT: That does hit.

1522
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.490
Go ahead and roll damage.

1523
01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:17.825
SAM: Is it sneak attack?

1524
01:04:17.825 --> 01:04:19.420
MATT: Actually because you jumped up into the tree and hid,

1525
01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.848
it would be sneak attack, so go.

1526
01:04:20.848 --> 01:04:23.848
[cheering]

1527
01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:27.210
TRAVIS: Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1528
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:28.140
SAM: 23!

1529
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:28.973
No!

1530
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:33.750
29!
[cheering]

1531
01:04:35.991 --> 01:04:37.610
MATT: (whooshes) As the impact of the crossbow bolt

1532
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:41.220
slams under its jaw, you see it cough (spluttering)

1533
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.030
and spit up this dark, purple-black blood

1534
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:46.120
that spatters and drips, and you can see

1535
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.432
the snow that it impacts immediately

1536
01:04:48.432 --> 01:04:50.300
(hisses) steam and sizzle.

1537
01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.540
You now see, as they've emerged from this area,

1538
01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:55.450
all the snow in the vicinity is melting and hissing

1539
01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:58.760
as it moves through the swathe of soft powder.

1540
01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.750
Does that finish your turn?

1541
01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.540
SAM: Not dead yet?
MATT: No.

1542
01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:05.400
SAM: Fuck, shit, fuck!
MATT: (laughs)

1543
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.360
All right.

1544
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.695
That now brings us to the main creature's turn.

1545
01:05:10.695 --> 01:05:12.907
Now that there is a mammoth that it just spit out.

1546
01:05:12.907 --> 01:05:17.732

SAM: Colts forged!

1551
01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.152
MATT: You don't know with what you toy.

1552
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.069
LIAM: You're going to drive him back to Uk'otoa.

1553
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:46.785
SAM: and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

1554
01:05:46.785 --> 01:05:50.827
MARISHA: Travis just wrote "bury Sam," I don't, oh.

1555
01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.803
MATT: All right, the creature,

1556
01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.680
it's spat out this large mammoth that is now (booming)

1557
01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.900
on the ground, pushing over a tree.

1558
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.490
Caduceus, you watch as this mammoth

1559
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:05.450
stomps the ground around you, shaking,

1560
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:08.058
it almost steps onto you.
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

1561
01:06:08.058 --> 01:06:10.820
[laughter]

1562
01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.330
MATT: The creature is going to go ahead and

1563
01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:15.329
try and swing its head up and try and shake off

1564
01:06:15.329 --> 01:06:19.300
what's on top of it.

1565
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.320
That's going to be

1566
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:25.550
26 to hit.

1567
01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:27.553
MARISHA: Me?
MATT: You, Beauregard.

1568
01:06:27.553 --> 01:06:29.950
MARISHA: No, yeah.

1569
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:31.640
Yep, it hits.

1570
01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:32.970
MATT: All right, so, Beauregard,

1571
01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:36.140
as it shakes you off, slamming its neck

1572
01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.780
up in the air, you lose your grip and (whooshes)

1573
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.623
fling, as you do, the head spins around (whisks)

1574
01:06:40.623 --> 01:06:41.620
and is going to attempt to

1575
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:44.887
bite you up into the air and does so.

1576
01:06:44.887 --> 01:06:45.720
LAURA: What?

1577
01:06:47.511 --> 01:06:50.344
MARISHA: Wow, that's kind of cool.

1578
01:06:52.017 --> 01:06:55.310
That was a dope move it just did.

1579
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:59.830
Sucks that it's me.
[laughter]

1580
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:01.940
MATT: Take 48 points of piercing damage.

1581
01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.460
(exclamations)

1582
01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.950
SAM: 48?
MATT: Yes.

1583
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:10.100
Plus nine points of fire damage.

1584
01:07:11.232 --> 01:07:14.560
[exclamations of dismay]

1585
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.822
LIAM: Bugs, man.

1586
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:19.360
MARISHA: I go limp in its jaws.

1587
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.760
I am unconscious.

1588
01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.920
MATT: You are unconscious.

1589
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.980
Your unconscious body is currently grappled

1590
01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.410
in its jaws.

1591
01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.060
SAM: Oh no.

1592
01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.589
Oh No-regard.

1593
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.172
(laughter)

1594
01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:38.500
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1595
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.657
MARISHA: Please don't kill me at a live show.

1596
01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:43.523
(laughter)

1597
01:07:43.523 --> 01:07:44.356
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

1598
01:07:44.356 --> 01:07:46.011
MATT: And then it burrows underground.

1599
01:07:46.011 --> 01:07:48.511
(yelling)

1600
01:07:54.786 --> 01:07:57.815
TRAVIS: You!

1601
01:07:57.815 --> 01:07:59.834
MATT: (laughs)

1602
01:07:59.834 --> 01:08:01.105
LAURA: Beau!

1603
01:08:03.223 --> 01:08:05.973
LIAM: (extended) No!

1604
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:10.168
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

1605
01:08:13.074 --> 01:08:15.730
MATT: There is an indent where, as it

1606
01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:18.050
disappears beneath, the cavern underneath,

1607
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:19.140
it's left there, open,

1608
01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.370
you can see the slight opening

1609
01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:22.130
and you can feel it rumbling in the ground,

1610
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:24.650
beneath where Caduceus and the mammoth are.

1611
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:28.840
But you have no visual sight of it at the moment.

1612
01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.326
Jester, your turn.

1613
01:08:30.326 --> 01:08:33.788
[laughter]

1614
01:08:33.788 --> 01:08:36.500
SAM: Wow.

1615
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.005
LAURA: I do a (squeaks) with my trunk.

1616
01:08:41.005 --> 01:08:42.976
LIAM: [elephant trumpet]

1617
01:08:42.976 --> 01:08:45.159
LAURA: (screams)

1618
01:08:45.159 --> 01:08:46.326
That was good!

1619
01:08:49.315 --> 01:08:52.711
I can't, I can't follow it as a mammoth.

1620
01:08:52.711 --> 01:08:54.660
TALIESIN: Well.

1621
01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:55.970
How big is the hole?

1622
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:57.360
How big is the hole?

1623
01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.990
MATT: The hole, I'd say a lot of it's collapsed inward,

1624
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:02.740
so it's about 10 feet across.
TALIESIN: Okay.

1625
01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:05.590
MATT: So it's about an eight to 10 foot from side to side

1626
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:07.160
and a lot of it is fallen in beneath it,

1627
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.840
but there is a little bit of an opening.

1628
01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.220
LAURA: I'm going to, I'm going to turn around and look

1629
01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.250
and I'm going to spot its baby.

1630
01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:17.900
MATT: There's the hole that it left right there.

1631
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:21.170
LAURA: I'm going to rage towards, try to charge the baby.

1632
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:22.330
MATT: All right.

1633
01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:24.530
You rush (thumping) over Caduceus.

1634
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:26.680
LAURA: How far away from it was me?

1635
01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.010
MATT: It's about 25 feet or so, I'd say.

1636
01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:33.730
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to walk, oh, at least 20 feet, okay,

1637
01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:36.810
I'm going to run forward and use a tramping charge on it.

1638
01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:39.860
MATT: I'm going to say--
[cheering]

1639
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.500
This tree is toast (laughs).

1640
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.950
As you slam towards it, Caduceus,

1641
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:46.060
you almost get pushed off to the side,

1642
01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.520
having to catch yourself on the edge of the snowbank.

1643
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.030
LAURA: It has to succeed on a strength check of 18.

1644
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.103
MATT: Okay.

1645
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:55.730
That is a, it has a good strength,

1646
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:56.880
but not enough on a natural three.

1647
01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.493
It's a seven, that's a failure, I'm pretty sure.

1648
01:10:00.493 --> 01:10:03.870
LAURA: So it's knocked prone and I get to make a bonus

1649
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:05.890
stomp action on it.
SAM: Whoa.

1650
01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:08.214
MATT: There you go.

1651
01:10:08.214 --> 01:10:10.820
Roll your damage on it, the impact.

1652
01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.640
LAURA: Well, that's a 23 to hit on it.

1653
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.890
MATT: A 23 to hit.

1654
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:15.030
That does hit.

1655
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:18.630
LAURA: So whoa.
[laughter]

1656
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.479
That's 4d10 bludgeoning damage.

1657
01:10:21.479 --> 01:10:23.810
[cheering]

1658
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:26.957
And that's just my bonus action.
TRAVIS: Fuck it up!

1659
01:10:28.287 --> 01:10:31.537
LIAM: [elephant trumpeting]

1660
01:10:31.537 --> 01:10:36.176
[cheering]

1661
01:10:36.176 --> 01:10:39.072
LAURA: That's 30 points of bludgeoning damage.

1662
01:10:42.194 --> 01:10:43.760
And then I'm going to gore it with my--

1663
01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.760
MATT: All right, roll damage.

1664
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:52.910
LAURA: Oh, that's 28 to hit!

1665
01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.050
Oh, shit, wait, that was 4d10 plus seven.

1666
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:59.520
I didn't add the seven.
MATT: Okay.

1667
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.510
LAURA: Holy <i>fuck.</i>
(laughter)

1668
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:07.500
And then the gore attack. It's cocked.

1669
01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.130
10, 15.

1670
01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:15.518
That's 15 plus seven, that's 20 what, 22

1671
01:11:15.518 --> 01:11:19.065
points of goring tusk damage.

1672
01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:21.970
MATT: You take eight points of fire damage.

1673
01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:24.269
LAURA: Fuck it, I'm a mammoth, I don't care.

1674
01:11:24.269 --> 01:11:29.261
[cheering]

1675
01:11:29.261 --> 01:11:33.741
[cheering]

1676
01:11:33.741 --> 01:11:35.245
MATT: And how do you want to do this?

1677
01:11:35.245 --> 01:11:39.562
[cheering and applause]

1678
01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:43.480
[cheering and applause]

1679
01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.025
LAURA: Caleb, make my noise for me.

1680
01:11:46.025 --> 01:11:48.574
LIAM: [elephant trumpeting]
LAURA: And I'm stomping.

1681
01:11:48.574 --> 01:11:52.600
MATT: (laughs)
LAURA: (screams)

1682
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.057
My trunk is everywhere!

1683
01:11:55.057 --> 01:11:57.640
Then I run over to Caleb and I'm stomping

1684
01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.320
and like: Let me out so that I can help Beau, though.

1685
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.990
Except I'm not saying that, I'm just thinking it.

1686
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:07.520
(groaning)

1687
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.490
MATT: Okay.

1688
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.000
As you rush towards, screaming that,

1689
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.600
you shove it down and as it's on the ground,

1690
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.090
you jam your tusks into it and tear its body through.

1691
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:17.930
You watch as its interior muscles tear open,

1692
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:21.700
its brackish, purple blood spraying across you

1693
01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.940
and burning your face, but also spattering across the snow

1694
01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.380
and as it does, the immediate snowbank behind it

1695
01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.520
just liquefies and you can see the green grass

1696
01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.010
below the surface, where the previous storm had covered.

1697
01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:35.378
The creature is no more.

1698
01:12:35.378 --> 01:12:40.264
[cheering]

1699
01:12:41.393 --> 01:12:43.588
LAURA: I kind of want to be a mammoth all the time.

1700
01:12:43.588 --> 01:12:45.240
[laughter]

1701
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.610
MATT: You hear [elephant trumpet].

1702
01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:51.610
I can't do it as well as Liam.

1703
01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.920
That finishes Jester's turn.

1704
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.870
Fjord, you're up with Beau on deck.

1705
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.790
TRAVIS: Yes, can I run over to the hole

1706
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.050
where the fucking asshole went?

1707
01:12:59.050 --> 01:12:59.883
MATT: Yeah.

1708
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:03.180
TRAVIS: Do I see anything?

1709
01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.070
MATT: Make a perception check.
TRAVIS: Oh, sure.

1710
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:08.580
12, 13.

1711
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:12.330
MATT: You see movement, as parts of the earth

1712
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:13.460
are closing in, you're not sure

1713
01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.710
which is snow and which is the creature,

1714
01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:15.960
but you can see movement.

1715
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.793
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1716
01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:19.650
I will take the Inescapable Lash whip

1717
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:23.607
and I will try to whip it from the, whip it good!

1718
01:13:23.607 --> 01:13:26.115
[cheering]

1719
01:13:26.115 --> 01:13:27.180
SAM: Dun, dun, dun, dun!

1720
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.469
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an attack.

1721
01:13:29.469 --> 01:13:33.660
TRAVIS: Okay.

1722
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.860
16, oh, plus five?

1723
01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.908
That's great, that's 20.

1724
01:13:39.908 --> 01:13:42.541
[cheering]

1725
01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:44.010
MATT: You're proficient with whips?

1726
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:44.843
TRAVIS: No.

1727
01:13:45.738 --> 01:13:46.630
I don't know why it says plus five.

1728
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:49.010
It's a plus one to hit, so it's 16.

1729
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.670
MARISHA: What's your?
TRAVIS: Dink, dink.

1730
01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:53.503
MATT: Right, right.

1731
01:13:53.503 --> 01:13:55.250
SAM: This is the problem when you don't have stats.

1732
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:57.220
LIAM: Yeah.
[laughter]

1733
01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.570
MATT: Well, no, I mean, if you're proficient with--

1734
01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:00.910
LIAM: New character, who dis?

1735
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.710
MATT: You're proficient with martial weapons, so yeah.

1736
01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:06.845
That plus five is your proficiency bonus.

1737
01:14:06.845 --> 01:14:09.222
[cheering]

1738
01:14:09.222 --> 01:14:10.890
That does hit, so go ahead and roll damage.

1739
01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:13.910
TRAVIS: Hey, 1d4 plus one!

1740
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:16.840
Two plus one is three!

1741
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.530
Four, four points of damage!

1742
01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:21.280
MATT: Four points of damage.

1743
01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280
LAURA: Are you going towards it

1744
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.500
or are you trying to bring it towards you?

1745
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.380
TRAVIS: Four points of damage and I will use my bonus action

1746
01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:29.070
to grapple the target.
SAM: Yes.

1747
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:31.610
MATT: Okay.

1748
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:33.550
SAM: With the whip or with your body?

1749
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:34.383
LAURA: With the whip.

1750
01:14:34.383 --> 01:14:37.410
TRAVIS: With the whip, I don't know, it's what it says!

1751
01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:40.750
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, it's a whip catch.
MATT: Okay, so (whooshes),

1752
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:43.110
you slap the whip down there, (whooshes)

1753
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.200
wraps around what movement is there

1754
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.120
and it begins to tug and pull.
TRAVIS: Fuck.

1755
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:49.200
SAM: Oh god.

1756
01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.410
MARISHA: Oh god.
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

1757
01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:52.630
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm holding onto that shit.

1758
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:53.463
MATT: Okay.

1759
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:56.077
Beau?

1760
01:14:56.077 --> 01:14:57.456
I need you to make a death-saving throw.

1761
01:14:57.456 --> 01:15:00.456
[groaning]

1762
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.863
MARISHA: Is it this one?

1763
01:15:03.863 --> 01:15:06.510
Is it?
TRAVIS: It is that one.

1764
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:10.360
MARISHA: Successful, 12.
MATT: Okay. That's one success.

1765
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:15.390
It's the wolf turn.

1766
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:16.917
It's even further out of sight.

1767
01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:18.290
[laughter]

1768
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:20.030
Caduceus, it's your turn.

1769
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:23.930
You see, as you recover from watching this mammoth Jester

1770
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:26.010
rush through and just completely destroy

1771
01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:28.750
the younger creature, you spin around and see

1772
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:31.050
Fjord whip and then (cracking) (groans),

1773
01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:33.960
start being pulled towards the opening in the ground.

1774
01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.276
What are you doing?

1775
01:15:35.276 --> 01:15:37.410
TALIESIN: Wow, I'm going to run right over

1776
01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:40.880
and look down and see if I can see what he just grabbed.

1777
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.713
MATT: Okay.

1778
01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.670
You move over here, that's 15 feet of movement there.

1779
01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:45.770
Make a perception check.

1780
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:46.820
TALIESIN: All right.

1781
01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.231
That's a 28.

1782
01:15:51.231 --> 01:15:53.020
[cheering]

1783
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.670
MATT: You can see there is currently

1784
01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:58.120
a whip around its, like the very tip of its tail

1785
01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.830
and one of its back legs and it is latched.

1786
01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:01.730
You can just barely see the cusp of it.

1787
01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:04.000
It's about to completely vanish beneath the surface.

1788
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.967
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Blight.
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

1789
01:16:07.967 --> 01:16:10.700
[cheering]

1790
01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.280
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I don't like it, no.

1791
01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.960
That says constitution 17 save.

1792
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.960
MATT: Natural one on the save.
[cheering]

1793
01:16:21.976 --> 01:16:23.580
Go ahead and roll damage.

1794
01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.672
TALIESIN: This is going to take a while.

1795
01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:28.600
Double checking what this does.

1796
01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.710
Yeah, okay, and this is necrotic energy.

1797
01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:33.370
MATT: It is.

1798
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:34.620
TALIESIN: Okay.

1799
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:37.770
Oh, that's nice.

1800
01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:41.302
16, that's 20.

1801
01:16:45.022 --> 01:16:49.010
34, 35, 37, 38.

1802
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:51.830
42 points of necrotic energy.

1803
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:54.900
MATT: Nice.
[cheering]

1804
01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:55.733
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1805
01:16:57.101 --> 01:16:59.240
MATT: I will say, as a reaction to the pain,

1806
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.090
it withdraws deeper inside.

1807
01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:03.950
Fjord, the whip is tugging you forward.

1808
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:05.890
Are you going to let go or continue to hold on?

1809
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:07.220
TRAVIS: I'm holding on to my sec--

1810
01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.369
MARISHA: No, this is turning into a BMX video, don't do it!

1811
01:17:10.369 --> 01:17:11.850
Let go of the bike.

1812
01:17:11.850 --> 01:17:12.750
LAURA: No.
SAM: Do it.

1813
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:13.640
MATT: Fjord, what are you doing?

1814
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.936
TRAVIS: I'm holding on.
MARISHA: (groans)

1815
01:17:15.936 --> 01:17:16.850
I love you.

1816
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:19.760
MATT: Fjord disappears into the hole

1817
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.440
as, very much like "Tremors," you're just (whooshes)

1818
01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:27.520
pulled (poofs) underground.

1819
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.353
All right.

1820
01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:31.660
SAM: Is it still a tunnel we can follow through or did it--

1821
01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:34.002
MATT: You can certainly try.

1822
01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:38.230
TALIESIN: Does it look like it's collapsing?

1823
01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:40.010
MATT: It looks like it's probably not meant to be

1824
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:42.130
structurally sound, the creature definitely doesn't

1825
01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:43.860
leave a bunch of, you know,

1826
01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.990
it's not a spherical worm that carves through the earth,

1827
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:48.200
it has a bunch of legs and burrows through

1828
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.100
and what's behind it seems to fall in.

1829
01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:53.630
TALIESIN: Yeah, before it vanishes,

1830
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:55.120
I'm going to use a bonus action

1831
01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.450
to cast Light on the creature

1832
01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:59.740
so we can maybe keep a light on it.

1833
01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.270
I don't know what else to do with it--

1834
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:02.354
MATT: You can cast bonus--

1835
01:18:02.354 --> 01:18:05.325
TALIESIN: Oh, and it's touch. Never mind.
MATT: Sorry, man.

1836
01:18:07.292 --> 01:18:10.793
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know what else other than, yeah.

1837
01:18:10.793 --> 01:18:11.626
I don't know what else.
MATT: All right.

1838
01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:12.970
That's the end of your turn?

1839
01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:13.880
You can still move if you want.

1840
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:17.260
You got 15 feet of movement.
TALIESIN: I can still move and

1841
01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:19.030
I have to be able to see,

1842
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:23.110
I have to see somebody to cast Spare the Dying, right?

1843
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.943
Yeah.
MATT: Correct.

1844
01:18:23.943 --> 01:18:25.334
TALIESIN: Never mind, okay.

1845
01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:28.990
Yeah, I'm going to circle in and just get ready

1846
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:30.990
and round that hole to see if it's

1847
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:33.640
going to collapse or if it's going to stay sound.

1848
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.580
MATT: You've got it.

1849
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:35.413
Caleb, you're up.

1850
01:18:35.413 --> 01:18:38.030
LIAM: Okay, Caleb's head is whipping back and forth

1851
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:40.900
from mammoth problem to hole to mammoth to hole.

1852
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.130
That's taken care of, drops the mammoth spell,

1853
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:44.810
Polymorph is gone.

1854
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:47.507
MATT: Jester suddenly is now standing over this body going.

1855
01:18:47.507 --> 01:18:52.146
(growling)

1856
01:18:52.146 --> 01:18:53.790
(laughs)

1857
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:55.520
LIAM: Using movement to run to the hole,

1858
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.770
am I able to get there with a vantage point to see

1859
01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:00.210
the creature in the hole?

1860
01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:02.080
MATT: You do not see a creature, all you see is rock

1861
01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.190
and snow falling in.

1862
01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:05.490
LIAM: I don't see anybody, I don't see my friends?

1863
01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.960
MATT: Actually, you do see Fjord's feet

1864
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.650
being pulled into the rock and snow.

1865
01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:14.100
LIAM: The catmint bloom comes out and I reach out my hand

1866
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.080
and a little spectral version of Frumpkin

1867
01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.170
appears right by Fjord and then (poofs),

1868
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.903
there is a giant cat's hand which attempts to grapple Fjord.

1869
01:19:21.903 --> 01:19:24.270
[cheering]
MATT: Okay.

1870
01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.800
All right, go ahead and roll for the attempt on that.

1871
01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.425
TRAVIS: Daisy chain!

1872
01:19:33.794 --> 01:19:35.710
LIAM: Okay, its strength is very high.

1873
01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:38.180
TALIESIN: I'm looking up options.

1874
01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:42.090
LIAM: That's a total of 32.
[cheering]

1875
01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:46.100
MATT: So the hand wraps around Fjord,

1876
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.840
the base of the legs and then (whooshes)

1877
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.070
begins to pull him out with the whip taut.

1878
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:53.043
I need you to make a strength check.

1879
01:19:53.043 --> 01:19:55.360
[groaning]

1880
01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.427
SAM: Oh no!

1881
01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.870
LAURA: Natural 20, natural 20, natural 20!

1882
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:05.380
TRAVIS: 17.
[cheering]

1883
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.510
MATT: You feel the shoulder joints

1884
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:13.820
pop, pop out a little bit,

1885
01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.520
but you maintain your hold and as you're pulled out there,

1886
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.810
your entire body is on fire. I will say,

1887
01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:22.350
because this is going to, you take three points

1888
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:26.870
of stretching damage.
(laughter)

1889
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:29.083
As your body is yanked out.

1890
01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:31.443
TRAVIS: It's almost like being with Avantika again.

1891
01:20:31.443 --> 01:20:34.443
[laughter]

1892
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:44.660
MATT: Is there any additional movement on the hand?

1893
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.610
LIAM: No, it will just pull taut

1894
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:52.020
and try to keep this from moving forward.

1895
01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.270
MATT: Okay, so as it pulls--

1896
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:55.079
LAURA: Pull him back!
MATT: You pull Fjord back

1897
01:20:55.079 --> 01:20:57.440
and out of the hole--
LIAM: I am able to?

1898
01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.900
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: It can do its movement

1899
01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.280
while holding?
MATT: I'll allow it

1900
01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.020
if you add some movement.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1901
01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.450
If I haven't lost hold of him,

1902
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:07.350
I will start to make slim even slimmer.

1903
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:10.562
MATT: Okay, how far back?

1904
01:21:10.562 --> 01:21:12.490
LIAM: Out of the hole, if I can.

1905
01:21:12.490 --> 01:21:14.070
MATT: Well, how much movement does it have?

1906
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.223
LIAM: Oh, yeah, that's probably something I should know.

1907
01:21:16.223 --> 01:21:18.480
[laughter]

1908
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.060
It's 30 or 60, where is it on the spell?

1909
01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.530
SAM: For the hand, for pushing,

1910
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:27.460
it's usually five feet per level.

1911
01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.600
LIAM: 60 feet.

1912
01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.830
MATT: 60 feet, so you can move back 30,

1913
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:33.270
because you are dragging, so it's a half-speed.

1914
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:35.900
Moving it back 30 feet,

1915
01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:39.410
it pulls up over the rock,

1916
01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:42.190
Fjord is like (groans) being stretched,

1917
01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:44.344
barely holding on--
LIAM: Is there a monk on a string?

1918
01:21:44.344 --> 01:21:47.232
MATT: As you do (crunching).

1919
01:21:47.232 --> 01:21:50.232
[cheering]

1920
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:55.010
You watch as, against its own strength,

1921
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:58.230
it's being pulled backwards, its legs are trying desperately

1922
01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:00.910
to burrow and dig in and find purchase against the rock

1923
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:03.380
and it's just being dragged out by this giant cat hand

1924
01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.180
as Fjord is just screaming in pain.

1925
01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.472
TRAVIS: This hurts so much!

1926
01:22:07.472 --> 01:22:10.732
Fuck!
[laughter]

1927
01:22:10.732 --> 01:22:13.820
MATT: Fuck it, you take another one point of damage.

1928
01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:16.620
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: (laughs) From the drag.

1929
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:17.820
I rolled it really well.

1930
01:22:19.614 --> 01:22:21.150
I rolled really poorly, so you're happy.

1931
01:22:21.150 --> 01:22:23.610
All right, that finishes Caleb's turn.

1932
01:22:23.610 --> 01:22:24.860
Nott, you're up.

1933
01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.290
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

1934
01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:27.660
MATT: You're still up in the tree.

1935
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.430
SAM: I'm going to hop down.

1936
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:31.820
I can see the creature, correct?

1937
01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.700
MATT: From where you are, it can glance over, yes.

1938
01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:36.060
There's a tree between the two of you,

1939
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:36.960
but the creature's large enough

1940
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.900
that you can see the movement around the outside.

1941
01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.700
SAM: I'll get close enough so I can see it

1942
01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:44.100
and I will take out a bit of fleece,

1943
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:46.440
remembering the instructions of Caleb

1944
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:51.357
and I will rub it together and I will cast Phantasmal Force

1945
01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:55.230
on the creature.
MATT: Jester there.

1946
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:57.380
Phantasmal Force, all right, what is the save on that?

1947
01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.320
SAM: Intelligence 15.

1948
01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.460
MATT: It actually, it rolled a 17,

1949
01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.802
but it's minus three on that, so that's a--

1950
01:23:06.802 --> 01:23:10.360
[cheering]

1951
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:13.180
So 14, what's your spell DC?

1952
01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.980
SAM: 15.
MATT: 15, it just fails.

1953
01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.250
SAM: Do I see Beau's legs dangling?

1954
01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:22.230
LAURA: She's fully in.
MATT: Well, you can see

1955
01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:25.400
the feet somewhat out.
SAM: Okay.

1956
01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.460
All right, I'm going to conjure an image in this beast's

1957
01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:32.400
mindscape. I'm going to make it think

1958
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.660
that Beauregard has wriggled free

1959
01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:39.470
and is slowly running away, flipping it the bird.

1960
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:42.331
I would like, I hope it takes a bite

1961
01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:44.460
at the fake Beau.

1962
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:49.170
LAURA: And drops the actual--
SAM: And drops the real Beau.

1963
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:50.730
MATT: Okay.

1964
01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:53.820
Well, if I recall, does it take psychic damage?

1965
01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.753
SAM: Only if it,

1966
01:23:56.753 --> 01:23:59.311
if the image that it perceives

1967
01:23:59.311 --> 01:24:02.000
is giving it damage.
MATT: Gotcha.

1968
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.690
All right, so, yeah, that is not the case.

1969
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:05.350
However, it does believe.

1970
01:24:08.995 --> 01:24:10.340
SAM: It believes that Beau is running away from it.

1971
01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.173
MATT: Yes, it does, okay.

1972
01:24:11.173 --> 01:24:13.420
SAM: So will it take an attack of opportunity?

1973
01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.085
MATT: Yes, it will, and it'll open its jaws

1974
01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:18.202
and Beau will fall.

1975
01:24:18.202 --> 01:24:21.202
[cheering]

1976
01:24:24.346 --> 01:24:26.029
TRAVIS: Fucking slick.

1977
01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.620
MATT: So Beau's unconscious body falls limp out of its jaws.

1978
01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:34.200
It is a 10-foot fall, so you do take a point of damage.

1979
01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.200
SAM: Oh, shit.

1980
01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.058
MATT: So you do lose a death save.

1981
01:24:37.058 --> 01:24:39.060
[groaning]

1982
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:41.602
MARISHA: It's okay, I'm good, I'm good!

1983
01:24:42.842 --> 01:24:44.680
MATT: It lashes out towards the illusion (whooshes),

1984
01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.140
moves through it, you watch as the running Beau,

1985
01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.280
suddenly the jaws snap around it

1986
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.780
and she just continues running out of its face (poofs).

1987
01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:54.080
It withdraws, confused, whipping around.

1988
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.020
SAM: Yep, that's it (laughs).
MARISHA: That was amazing!

1989
01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.770
SAM: I will use my bonus action to hide

1990
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:03.380
and my free action to remind everyone

1991
01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:05.394
that you can still vote in the election.

1992
01:25:05.394 --> 01:25:07.090
[laughter]

1993
01:25:07.090 --> 01:25:09.630
And if I am elected, you'll see

1994
01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:13.498
many more cool moves like that.

1995
01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.060
MATT: All righty.
SAM: Bonus action hide.

1996
01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.900
MATT: Make a stealth check with disadvantage

1997
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.630
just because the snow here is starting to melt.

1998
01:25:24.630 --> 01:25:25.680
Actually, where you're standing right now,

1999
01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.020
there's very little snow because of the creature,

2000
01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.446
so I won't allow it.

2001
01:25:28.446 --> 01:25:29.279
SAM: Okay.

2002
01:25:29.279 --> 01:25:30.112
MATT: From the death of where it died,

2003
01:25:30.112 --> 01:25:31.270
all the snow in the region has now melted,

2004
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:32.240
so there'd be nowhere to hide.

2005
01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.600
SAM: I'll take it.
MATT: Okay.

2006
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.682
That finishes its turn, now it's the creature's turn.

2007
01:25:36.682 --> 01:25:37.730
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2008
01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.130
MATT: Angry and being pulled back

2009
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:41.490
and snapping at the unconscious Beau,

2010
01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:43.750
the only other thing that it sees within range

2011
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:46.250
within range is Caduceus.

2012
01:25:47.696 --> 01:25:49.240
LAURA: Didn't it see the Beau that

2013
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.200
came out of its mouth running away?

2014
01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.980
MATT: It does, but it runs away.

2015
01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:55.076
SAM: I said very slowly.

2016
01:25:55.076 --> 01:25:56.220
[laughter]

2017
01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.620
It's just doing a fade away--

2018
01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:00.670
MATT: In order for it to make an attack of opportunity,

2019
01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:02.860
she has to move out of its melee range, so.

2020
01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:06.790
However, that will be a 20 to hit.

2021
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:07.623
What's your armor class?

2022
01:26:07.623 --> 01:26:09.230
TALIESIN: 18.
MATT: So that does hit.

2023
01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:15.180
Caduceus, you take...

2024
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:16.275
Man!

2025
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:20.510
Like, just so you guys are aware,

2026
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:24.334
it's 6d10 damage on this.

2027
01:26:24.334 --> 01:26:25.190
I've been rolling so well.

2028
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:28.334
This is an eight, 10, nine, 10, six, and a three.

2029
01:26:28.334 --> 01:26:30.750
[shouting]
I've been rolling so well

2030
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:32.630
on damage tonight, I am so sorry.

2031
01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:34.620
TALIESIN: Guys.
LIAM: I was so waiting for,

2032
01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.602
"It's all ones, you guys, it's all ones."

2033
01:26:37.602 --> 01:26:39.106
MATT: (laughs)

2034
01:26:39.106 --> 01:26:44.106
All right, 32, 38, 46, plus seven.

2035
01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:46.849
53 points of piercing damage, Caduceus.

2036
01:26:46.849 --> 01:26:49.820
[groaning]

2037
01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.960
And 10 points of fire damage.

2038
01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:58.980
As it snaps you into its jaws, its teeth crunch around you,

2039
01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.600
you feel the armor pressure in the shield

2040
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.013
just placed up against your torso.

2041
01:27:02.013 --> 01:27:04.350
Your staff almost snaps from the impact

2042
01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:05.850
as it draws you up into its mouth.

2043
01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:07.810
You are grappled and restrained.

2044
01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:09.070
Lifted up, your feet dangling

2045
01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:11.170
and just barely kicking past the unconscious body of Beau

2046
01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:13.850
bleeding out in the snow.

2047
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:17.450
And it's grappled from the rope,

2048
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:19.970
so it can't move, so it can't burrow,

2049
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:23.137
so it's going to stay there.
[cheering]

2050
01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:25.930
Jester, your turn.

2051
01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:29.760
LAURA: (groans)

2052
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.260
Fuck.

2053
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:37.100
I can't run up to it or else I will die if I try to do that

2054
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:40.320
so I'm going to Guiding Bolt it.

2055
01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.670
MATT: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah, from far away.

2056
01:27:42.670 --> 01:27:45.210
TALIESIN: But Beau, also--
LAURA: I'm going to, I know.

2057
01:27:45.210 --> 01:27:47.090
I'm going to try to take it out.

2058
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:49.540
I'm going to Guiding Bolt it at level--

2059
01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:52.350
SAM: 20.
LAURA: At level four.

2060
01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:54.880
Guiding Bolt it at level four.

2061
01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.800
MATT: Okay (laughs).

2062
01:27:56.894 --> 01:27:58.480
Go ahead and roll an attack on it.

2063
01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.110
LAURA: Beau's unconscious.

2064
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:01.610
MATT: Beau is unconscious on the ground, yes.

2065
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:02.980
LIAM: Two death saves.

2066
01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:08.101
MARISHA: Do you, you do you.
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

2067
01:28:08.101 --> 01:28:10.259
LAURA: No!

2068
01:28:11.105 --> 01:28:12.920
MATT: What are you doing, Jester?

2069
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.070
Level four Guiding Bolt or something?

2070
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:18.530
LAURA: Well, if it dies then Beau will be saved, see.

2071
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:21.110
MATT: That's a valid point.

2072
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:22.418
TRAVIS: But it'll...

2073
01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.430
LAURA: If it bleeds, though,

2074
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:31.430
then Beau will be in a lot of trouble here (screeches).

2075
01:28:32.965 --> 01:28:34.665
But (heavy breathing), I'm going--

2076
01:28:35.544 --> 01:28:36.550
MATT: Hurry up, decisions, you got six seconds.

2077
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:37.590
You will have been passed--
LAURA: No, no, no!

2078
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:38.980
MATT: If you don't make a choice here, waste your turn.

2079
01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.140
LAURA: No, no, okay, okay, okay, okay,

2080
01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.982
look, I'm going to run up.

2081
01:28:44.982 --> 01:28:46.943
And I'm going to Cure Wounds on Beau.

2082
01:28:46.943 --> 01:28:50.726
[cheering]

2083
01:28:52.502 --> 01:28:55.350
LAURA: I'm going to slide down and I'm going to hold her.

2084
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:58.680
MATT: The snow itself is hard to move through in this space,

2085
01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.160
but you move across the rock and slide down the side.

2086
01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.190
Your movement gets you to right about where Beau is,

2087
01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:05.990
then the five feet before there.

2088
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:07.700
The heat is emanating from the creature.

2089
01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.150
Beau on the ground--
LAURA: I reach down and I

2090
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:11.640
put my hand on Beau's forehead

2091
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.470
and I cast Cure Wounds at level four.

2092
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:15.870
MATT: All righty.

2093
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:19.290
LAURA: That's 4d8 plus five.

2094
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:21.343
Okay.

2095
01:29:21.343 --> 01:29:24.873
14, 18, 20, plus 25 points.

2096
01:29:24.873 --> 01:29:28.580
[cheering]

2097
01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.120
MARISHA: Fuck.

2098
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:33.030
LAURA: I'm a cleric.
(laughter)

2099
01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:45.760
TRAVIS: With disdain.
LAURA: As a bonus action,

2100
01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.000
I'm going to just be like: Man,

2101
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.530
I think I could have killed it.

2102
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:54.140
[laughter]

2103
01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.498
MATT: As you envision what it felt like

2104
01:29:55.498 --> 01:29:57.156
to have strong tusks.

2105
01:29:58.290 --> 01:29:59.900
Beauregard, you come back to consciousness.

2106
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:02.010
MARISHA: Do I come back to consciousness

2107
01:30:02.010 --> 01:30:05.496
seeing Jester's face of regret and disdain?

2108
01:30:05.496 --> 01:30:08.079
(laughter)

2109
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:11.020
I just say--
LAURA: I'm glad you're back

2110
01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:14.010
and stuff.
[laughter]

2111
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:17.280
MARISHA: Why aren't you, like, a wizard or a sorcerer?

2112
01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.990
LAURA: I don't know.
[laughter]

2113
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:27.650
LIAM: Best friends forever, K-I-D.

2114
01:30:29.786 --> 01:30:30.619
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2115
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:33.560
MATT: All righty, that finishes Jester's turn.

2116
01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.200
Fjord.

2117
01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.883
TRAVIS: Yes, I still have the whip

2118
01:30:36.883 --> 01:30:38.108
attached to its foot, right?

2119
01:30:38.108 --> 01:30:39.080
MATT: You do.

2120
01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.670
LAURA: Its foot.

2121
01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:42.510
TRAVIS: Whatever the fuck it has,

2122
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:46.600
as an action, I can-- buh buh bleh, buh bleh bleh--

2123
01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.360
cause them to become restrained?

2124
01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.193
MATT: If you'd like to.

2125
01:30:50.193 --> 01:30:51.760
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to try and do that.

2126
01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:52.840
MATT: Okay.

2127
01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:56.250
So as you, you're standing there,

2128
01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:58.380
holding it at bay, you invoke the whip,

2129
01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:00.390
and it pulls you a little bit forward

2130
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:05.000
and the claw a little bit slightly (whooshes) towards it.

2131
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.735
As the whip begins to extend and wrap around it,

2132
01:31:09.735 --> 01:31:12.240
you see its body begin to be rope-tied

2133
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.420
along its midsection and it's pulling against it.

2134
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:17.580
You are--
[shouting]

2135
01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.420
Magically hogtying
[cheering]

2136
01:31:22.847 --> 01:31:24.163
this creature.

2137
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:29.420
SAM: Hogtie it!

2138
01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.730
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2139
01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:33.120
MATT: That's your action.
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, that's it.

2140
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.130
That's the end of my turn.

2141
01:31:35.130 --> 01:31:36.490
MATT: All righty.

2142
01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:38.550
TRAVIS: I'd love to give you a health potion or, you know,

2143
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:40.820
do something else, but that's all I've got.

2144
01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.530
[laughter]

2145
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:43.823
MATT: Beau, it's your turn.

2146
01:31:43.823 --> 01:31:46.280
MARISHA: (groans)

2147
01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.113
Okay.

2148
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:50.630
MATT: Caduceus is currently up here, in its jaws.

2149
01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:52.000
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: There you go.

2150
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.690
Just for a visual aid, you know, make it fun.

2151
01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:55.570
TALIESIN: No, not yet.

2152
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.180
MARISHA: How, hmm...

2153
01:32:00.761 --> 01:32:02.533
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: Fucking run.

2154
01:32:02.533 --> 01:32:04.690
LAURA: No, no, you've got the lightning gloves!

2155
01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:06.375
MARISHA: Hm?
LAURA: You've got lightning gloves.

2156
01:32:06.375 --> 01:32:08.920
SAM: (pigeon coos)
LAURA: I'm right next to her.

2157
01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:09.753
SAM: (coos) Lightning gloves.

2158
01:32:09.753 --> 01:32:10.650
LAURA: I say: Don't hit it, it's--

2159
01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.360
MARISHA: Mm-hm.
LAURA: It makes--

2160
01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:16.260
MARISHA: Yeah, get to use those once a day.

2161
01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:19.268
This feels like a long hiking trip.

2162
01:32:19.268 --> 01:32:22.270
[laughter]

2163
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:24.100
LAURA: We could rest after this, you know.

2164
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:25.450
MARISHA: I will take out

2165
01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:27.550
my bo staff, though.

2166
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:29.920
Do a cool little flourish.

2167
01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.720
MATT: You're still prone.

2168
01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:35.433
MARISHA: Stand up.
MATT: Okay.

2169
01:32:35.433 --> 01:32:37.783
LAURA: Ooh, but do that cool Arya move where she spins

2170
01:32:37.783 --> 01:32:40.570
and jumps up and yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2171
01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:41.740
MATT: You got it.

2172
01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:45.771
MARISHA: And help myself up there as a way.

2173
01:32:45.771 --> 01:32:47.681
MATT: So not as cool as I envisioned, sure.

2174
01:32:47.681 --> 01:32:49.270
MARISHA: Then pop, pop!

2175
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:52.103
MATT: Go for it, two attacks on it.

2176
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.802
MARISHA: Both natural 19s.

2177
01:32:55.802 --> 01:32:56.635
MATT: Nice.

2178
01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:01.370
Damage on the first one?

2179
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:03.130
MARISHA: I rolled an eight on an eight.

2180
01:33:03.130 --> 01:33:05.570
13.
MATT: 13 points of--

2181
01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:09.710
MARISHA: And another eight.
[cheering]

2182
01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:11.600
26.
MATT: Nice!

2183
01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.710
[cheering]

2184
01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:16.380
Great, so, whack, whack with the staff twice,

2185
01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:19.130
with each slam, the heat that bursts out of its body,

2186
01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:20.820
you take--
MARISHA: Can I run?

2187
01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:23.470
MATT: Nine points of fire damage.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay,

2188
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:25.930
okay, please don't die.
MATT: And 14 points

2189
01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:28.980
of fire damage.
[gasping]

2190
01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:31.180
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: Whoa, that's dangerous.

2191
01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:33.000
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

2192
01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:35.670
SAM: That's like two, right?

2193
01:33:37.108 --> 01:33:37.941
MARISHA: Yep.

2194
01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:40.563
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

2195
01:33:40.563 --> 01:33:44.108
MARISHA: Uh-huh, I'm going to Step of the Wind.

2196
01:33:44.108 --> 01:33:46.691
(laughter)

2197
01:33:47.661 --> 01:33:50.190
LIAM: No, no, hit it again, hit it again.

2198
01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:51.190
MARISHA: No!

2199
01:33:52.122 --> 01:33:53.797
MARISHA: I will spend a ki point

2200
01:33:53.797 --> 01:33:56.397
to take the disengage action.

2201
01:33:57.290 --> 01:34:00.582
MATT: Pop, pop (whooshing).

2202
01:34:00.582 --> 01:34:01.540
(laughter)

2203
01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:03.810
MARISHA: I cry a little, yeah.

2204
01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:05.900
MATT: Just go running full speed.
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

2205
01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.240
MATT: You lost half your speed getting up,

2206
01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.250
so you have 20 feet of movement left, I believe,

2207
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:13.040
what's your movement speed?
MARISHA: 45 feet of movement.

2208
01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.400
MATT: Yeah, I'll put you 25 feet.

2209
01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.110
You can move away from it if you want to.

2210
01:34:17.054 --> 01:34:18.950
Are you going full 25?
MARISHA: Yes!

2211
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:20.210
MATT: All right (laughs).

2212
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:22.123
There you go,

2213
01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:24.220
just sprinting through.
LAURA: I'm still on the ground.

2214
01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.920
MATT: Actually, technically, the snow,

2215
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.480
well, no, I'd say it's melting around the creature

2216
01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:29.160
because of its proximity.
MARISHA: I go away from

2217
01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.810
the melty bile.
MATT: You got it.

2218
01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:31.643
MARISHA: I don't.

2219
01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.490
MATT: That finishes your turn, Beau?

2220
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:35.420
MARISHA: Yeah!

2221
01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.450
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

2222
01:34:36.450 --> 01:34:37.890
You are also grappled and restrained

2223
01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:40.070
and you're not, it's not darkness,

2224
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:41.900
it bit onto your body, and one arm

2225
01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:43.460
and your head is sticking out one side.

2226
01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:46.490
One leg is inside, you're pushed up and mangled.

2227
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:47.990
You can still see, but you're being flung around

2228
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:50.110
as it swings you (whooshing) side to side.

2229
01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:51.060
What are you doing?

2230
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.135
TALIESIN: Well, I'm torn.

2231
01:34:54.135 --> 01:34:57.135
[laughter]

2232
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.660
TRAVIS: Bad use of words, that's not, no--

2233
01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:00.760
LIAM: Not yet, you're not.

2234
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:04.383
TALIESIN: This thing was looking pretty rough a while ago,

2235
01:35:04.383 --> 01:35:06.330
right?
MATT: You started to see it take damage.

2236
01:35:06.330 --> 01:35:08.090
It's starting to look rough, yeah.

2237
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:11.284
TALIESIN: Starting to look rough, that's so nice.

2238
01:35:11.284 --> 01:35:13.000
[laughter]

2239
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.540
I'm going to just, I'm going to trust in my friends' ability

2240
01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:22.510
to get shit done and I'm going to cast

2241
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:27.510
what's that thing where if I hit zero I go back to one?

2242
01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:28.913
Where is it?

2243
01:35:28.913 --> 01:35:29.780
Is it--
LAURA: Death Ward?

2244
01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:32.000
TALIESIN: Death Ward, yeah, I'm going to do Death Ward.

2245
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:32.833
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Where are you?

2246
01:35:32.833 --> 01:35:35.963
I'm going to cast Death Ward on myself.

2247
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:38.323
MATT: Go for it.
LIAM: Tal,

2248
01:35:38.323 --> 01:35:40.420
do you still have the periapt?

2249
01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.250
The Periapt of Wound Closure?
TALIESIN: I do.

2250
01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:46.280
I don't have, yeah, I auto-stabilize,

2251
01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.040
but this way, I don't, you know, I'm conscious.

2252
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.320
MATT: All right, you got it, so, Death Ward on yourself.

2253
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:54.260
You feel the Wildmother's magic suffuse you

2254
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:56.950
and safeguard you from slipping into the edge of death.

2255
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:59.110
TALIESIN: Excellent and for my bonus action,

2256
01:35:59.110 --> 01:36:00.510
if I have one, where are we?

2257
01:36:02.941 --> 01:36:05.417
I can't do Healing Word on myself, can I?

2258
01:36:05.417 --> 01:36:07.550
No, I can't do that.

2259
01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.980
Just for fun, I'm going to turn invisible

2260
01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:17.250
to see what happens?
[laughter]

2261
01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:18.083
MATT: Okay.

2262
01:36:20.021 --> 01:36:24.255
(poofs) The jaws are now chewing something.

2263
01:36:24.255 --> 01:36:26.560
(laughs)

2264
01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:27.393
You got it.

2265
01:36:27.393 --> 01:36:28.460
TALIESIN: I'm going for whatever I got, okay.

2266
01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:29.520
MATT: All righty, that ends Caduceus' turn.

2267
01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.140
Caleb, you're up.

2268
01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:34.170
LIAM: The bug is restrained, correct, from the whip?

2269
01:36:34.170 --> 01:36:35.411
MATT: Currently, yes.

2270
01:36:35.411 --> 01:36:37.020
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so the cat's claw,

2271
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.440
Cat's Ire is going to drop Fjord, let go,

2272
01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.750
and just shred the bug.

2273
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:43.730
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: You also have advantage

2274
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:45.820
because--
LIAM: Because it's restrained.

2275
01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:46.810
TRAVIS: Sorry, Beau.

2276
01:36:46.810 --> 01:36:49.160
LIAM: So Fjord, you get pushed out of the way and drop,

2277
01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.632
like (grunts) the whip goes limp a little bit

2278
01:36:51.632 --> 01:36:54.260
and the cat's claw rushes forward, claws out.

2279
01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:55.680
Go ahead and roll an attack, I believe it is.

2280
01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:58.293
Is that what you're trying to do?

2281
01:36:58.293 --> 01:37:00.684
LIAM: Low rolls, both low rolls.
MATT: Aw.

2282
01:37:00.684 --> 01:37:03.870
LIAM: It's a-- zub zub zub-- 15.

2283
01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:05.230
MATT: 15 does not hit, unfortunately.

2284
01:37:05.230 --> 01:37:06.328
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

2285
01:37:06.328 --> 01:37:07.161
MATT: The claws hit the back of its body.

2286
01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:08.850
Unfortunately, a section of its carapace

2287
01:37:08.850 --> 01:37:10.620
that hasn't taken a lot of damage yet.

2288
01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.490
It scrapes and you can see marks left behind,

2289
01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:14.645
but nothing actually pierces into flesh.

2290
01:37:14.645 --> 01:37:17.280
LIAM: Okay, I am going to drag it towards me

2291
01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.770
for some of its movement and I am going to back away

2292
01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:22.080
towards the player called Liam.

2293
01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.050
MATT: Going to back away?

2294
01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:23.883
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

2295
01:37:23.883 --> 01:37:25.690
MATT: All righty, how much?

2296
01:37:25.690 --> 01:37:27.790
LIAM: Hey, let's go the full 30 and we'll put the

2297
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:30.150
Cat's Ire halfway between me and the bug.

2298
01:37:30.150 --> 01:37:31.540
MATT: Okay, climbing onto the rock,

2299
01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:32.410
you lose a little bit of movement

2300
01:37:32.410 --> 01:37:33.780
and the Cat's Ire is going to move,

2301
01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:36.130
shift into that space there.

2302
01:37:36.130 --> 01:37:37.580
All righty.

2303
01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:39.700
That finishes your go.

2304
01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.260
Nott, you are up first.

2305
01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.060
TALIESIN: Nott.
LAURA: You've got to kill it.

2306
01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:45.210
SAM: I've got to kill it?
LAURA: You have to kill it.

2307
01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:48.840
SAM: I hope I don't kill Caduceus.

2308
01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:52.600
I'm going to, he's engaged with Caduceus, right?

2309
01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.960
MATT: Caduceus is nowhere to be seen.

2310
01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.793
SAM: Shit.

2311
01:37:57.659 --> 01:37:58.828
LAURA: But I am right underneath.
MATT: There is a whip around it.

2312
01:37:58.828 --> 01:38:01.400
It looks like it's currently bound a bit by it

2313
01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.970
as Fjord is now facedown, in the snow, being dragged.

2314
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:06.240
LAURA: I'm on my knees.
TRAVIS: Do something!

2315
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.280
LAURA: Right underneath it.

2316
01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.865
SAM: Does it seem like, fuck--
TRAVIS: Shoot it!

2317
01:38:10.865 --> 01:38:12.670
MATT: What are you doing, Nott?
SAM: I will, I will shoot it!

2318
01:38:12.670 --> 01:38:14.100
I will, I will shoot it!

2319
01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:14.933
MATT: It is restrained,

2320
01:38:14.933 --> 01:38:15.840
so you do have advantage on the attack.

2321
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.310
SAM: Oh, great, I will shoot it.
TRAVIS: Fucking hurry up!

2322
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:21.510
SAM: Okay, I can't, you're talking so weird!

2323
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:23.720
[laughter]

2324
01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:26.410
29 to hit.
MATT: Jesus!

2325
01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:29.620
That hits, go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack.

2326
01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:31.970
SAM: With sneak attack, okay, good, thank god.

2327
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:32.930
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2328
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:37.768
SAM: Also, sorry, I was going to use my explosive arrow.

2329
01:38:37.768 --> 01:38:38.640
[cheering]

2330
01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:39.950
TRAVIS: You get advantage.
MATT: Okay.

2331
01:38:40.793 --> 01:38:42.230
Go for it.
TRAVIS: Advantage on this.

2332
01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:44.531
MATT: Sure.
SAM: Okay.

2333
01:38:44.531 --> 01:38:45.364
TALIESIN: If you can hit a part of it

2334
01:38:45.364 --> 01:38:46.972
that's away from the head.

2335
01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:50.710
MATT: He doesn't see anything.
TALIESIN: No, okay, again.

2336
01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:52.360
MATT: This seems very familiar.

2337
01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.350
SAM: 21.

2338
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:54.300
TALIESIN: Again.
MATT: 21.

2339
01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.250
SAM: But that doesn't include the explosive.

2340
01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:58.710
MATT: Correct, now roll the explosive damage.

2341
01:38:58.710 --> 01:39:00.140
SAM: Which is?

2342
01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.930
MATT: Oh, it's 3d6.

2343
01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.160
3d6 fire damage.
TALIESIN: This could end me.

2344
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:09.350
SAM: Nine more.

2345
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:11.510
MATT: All right, so the creature and Caduceus

2346
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:13.340
both take nine points of fire damage.

2347
01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:14.560
However, it's immune to fire,

2348
01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.760
so the explosion has no effect on it.

2349
01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.260
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, dude.

2350
01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.826
TALIESIN: Thanks, Sam, that's cool. Thanks.

2351
01:39:20.826 --> 01:39:22.267
SAM: 'Kay. So just 21 points.

2352
01:39:22.267 --> 01:39:23.210
MATT: 21 points of damage to it

2353
01:39:23.210 --> 01:39:24.680
and Caduceus, you take nine points of fire damage.

2354
01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:26.560
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.
SAM: Are you alive?

2355
01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.744
TALIESIN: You don't know.

2356
01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:32.890
MATT: As the arrow impacts and (booming) detonates--

2357
01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:34.120
LAURA: Are you no longer invisible, though,

2358
01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:35.490
because you just took some more damage?

2359
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:37.210
TALIESIN: No, I'm invisible 'til my next round.

2360
01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:38.970
MATT: Yeah, damage doesn't get rid of invisibility,

2361
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:40.760
so you see the explosion, the smoke emerge,

2362
01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.220
the creature seems unfazed

2363
01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:43.760
except for the wound that it took,

2364
01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.740
its jaws almost clamped around this invisible space

2365
01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:47.980
where you see this burn mark

2366
01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:49.851
and you hear a slight grunt of pain.

2367
01:39:49.851 --> 01:39:52.810
(grunting)
SAM: Bonus action, fire again!

2368
01:39:52.810 --> 01:39:55.350
MATT: All right, fire again.
SAM: With advantage, still or?

2369
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:57.170
MATT: Yeah, it's still restrained.

2370
01:39:57.170 --> 01:39:58.410
SAM: Okay, 24 to hit.

2371
01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:00.290
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2372
01:40:01.672 --> 01:40:05.930
SAM: That is 11 points of damage.

2373
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:07.220
MATT: 11 points of damage.

2374
01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:09.280
It's looking really hurt.
(groaning)

2375
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.113
It's looking really hurt.

2376
01:40:10.113 --> 01:40:12.041
The second one sinks into its body.

2377
01:40:12.041 --> 01:40:16.210
It now is trying to find a way to escape.

2378
01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:17.043
MARISHA: Fuck.

2379
01:40:17.043 --> 01:40:18.250
MATT: That finishes your turn.

2380
01:40:18.250 --> 01:40:20.850
SAM: I'll just use my movement to go huddle with Caleb.

2381
01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:24.030
That's it.
MATT: All righty.

2382
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.863
TALIESIN: Hey, guys.

2383
01:40:26.083 --> 01:40:27.680
MATT: That gets you up onto the rock with Caleb.

2384
01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.660
On its turn, it's going to go ahead.

2385
01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.680
TALIESIN: It's still restrained?
MATT: It is restrained,

2386
01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.720
but so are you, so it's just a straight roll.

2387
01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.158
That's an, oh, that's 28.

2388
01:40:40.033 --> 01:40:42.249
(gurgling) It swallows Caduceus.

2389
01:40:42.249 --> 01:40:46.340
[shouting]
Falling into its gullet,

2390
01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:48.590
darkness takes you as the muscles constrain

2391
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:51.200
and burn against your body.

2392
01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:54.407
You're blinded.
TALIESIN: Cool.

2393
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:56.520
TRAVIS: The fuck, man?

2394
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.570
MATT: It's going to attempt to burrow again.

2395
01:41:03.607 --> 01:41:05.140
Make a strength check for me.

2396
01:41:06.138 --> 01:41:09.001
[groaning]

2397
01:41:09.001 --> 01:41:10.450
TRAVIS: I thought its speed was zero.

2398
01:41:10.450 --> 01:41:11.620
SAM: Hold that, tiger!

2399
01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:13.657
TRAVIS: I thought its speed was zero.

2400
01:41:13.657 --> 01:41:16.710
AUDIENCE: (chanting) Fjord, Fjord, Fjord!

2401
01:41:16.710 --> 01:41:20.380
TRAVIS: 19.
[cheering]

2402
01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:22.773
MATT: So.

2403
01:41:24.690 --> 01:41:26.690
From a--
MARISHA: Oh my god.

2404
01:41:28.343 --> 01:41:29.500
MATT: I'm considering this a contested roll

2405
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:32.170
because you're trying to grapple a huge creature

2406
01:41:32.170 --> 01:41:35.440
with a 20-foot whip, so I'm considering it restrained

2407
01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.280
but I'm not considering its speed reduced to zero,

2408
01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.960
I'm considering it a contested strength roll.

2409
01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.135
It rolled a natural four plus seven, so it's an eleven.

2410
01:41:43.135 --> 01:41:46.135
[cheering]

2411
01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.460
It attempts to burrow and dig in

2412
01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:51.940
and in spite of yourself, your arms still hurt,

2413
01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:54.850
you pull back, and dig your feet into the rock,

2414
01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:57.662
and lean and lean and you can feel the tissue

2415
01:41:57.662 --> 01:41:59.890
(crackling)
[groaning]

2416
01:41:59.890 --> 01:42:02.860
You take, I'll say, 13 points

2417
01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:08.110
of just internal damage as your arms are just

2418
01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:10.330
tearing away from your body.

2419
01:42:10.330 --> 01:42:12.625
But the creature does not move.

2420
01:42:12.625 --> 01:42:17.625
MARISHA: (laughs)
[cheering]

2421
01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:22.937
MATT: Now it's Jester's turn.

2422
01:42:22.937 --> 01:42:24.200
LAURA: (scared sigh)

2423
01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.033
Okay.

2424
01:42:26.701 --> 01:42:30.741
I'm going to cast--
TRAVIS: Smoke this fucking thing!

2425
01:42:30.741 --> 01:42:32.450
[laughter]

2426
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:35.760
LAURA: Yeah, okay, I'm going to try to Guiding Bolt it then,

2427
01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:36.710
this time.
MATT: Okay.

2428
01:42:37.630 --> 01:42:38.463
MARISHA: Up the butt!

2429
01:42:38.463 --> 01:42:39.296
LAURA: Okay.

2430
01:42:40.210 --> 01:42:42.908
Yeah, I'm going to Guiding--
MATT: What level?

2431
01:42:42.908 --> 01:42:46.250
LAURA: At level four.

2432
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:47.550
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.

2433
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:49.860
It is restrained still, so you get advantage

2434
01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:52.510
on the attack roll, yes.

2435
01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:55.663
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2436
01:42:55.663 --> 01:42:57.032
SAM: She's choosing her dice.

2437
01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:01.250
LAURA: Two natural 16s.

2438
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:04.400
So plus nine is a 25 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

2439
01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:08.250
Go ahead and roll damage.
[cheering]

2440
01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:10.830
LAURA: So wait, that's at level four,

2441
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:13.851
so Guiding Bolt, that's 7d6.

2442
01:43:13.851 --> 01:43:16.851
[cheering]

2443
01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:21.660
SAM: Come on, come on, come on, come on.

2444
01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:25.650
LAURA: 11, 14,

2445
01:43:25.650 --> 01:43:29.917
16, 20 points of radiant damage.

2446
01:43:31.730 --> 01:43:32.792
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2447
01:43:32.792 --> 01:43:35.369
(cheering)

2448
01:43:35.369 --> 01:43:40.036
[cheering]

2449
01:43:40.036 --> 01:43:44.953
[cheering]

2450
01:43:44.953 --> 01:43:49.822
[cheering]

2451
01:43:49.822 --> 01:43:51.840
LAURA: From crouching down on the ground

2452
01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:54.360
with my hand raised up, I'm going to say:

2453
01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.284
Traveler, I have so much faith in you right now,

2454
01:43:57.284 --> 01:43:59.680
you are the most amazing person/god, I've ever met

2455
01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.920
and I love you and please save us all!

2456
01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.660
And I'm going to shoot pink Guiding energy out of my hand.

2457
01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:09.650
MATT: As you release your hand, you watch a

2458
01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:11.800
bright, radiant doorway (whooshes) open

2459
01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.340
and, right before your hand,

2460
01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:16.080
and from the center of that horizon,

2461
01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.420
the familiar symbol, you watch energy gather like a sunrise.

2462
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.970
Then (poofs) fire off towards the creature,

2463
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:27.080
impact underneath its jaw as it bursts with radiant energy,

2464
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.290
it burns away, it screams (screeches),

2465
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:32.750
this high-pitched scream as it rears up

2466
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:34.660
and as the burning radiant energy

2467
01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:37.420
continues to just cast away pieces of its flesh

2468
01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:40.960
and its armored hide, it leaves this smoking stump

2469
01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.530
where its head once was, the body (thumps),

2470
01:44:43.530 --> 01:44:45.603
slumping to the ground, no longer alive.

2471
01:44:45.603 --> 01:44:49.811
[cheering]

2472
01:44:54.687 --> 01:44:57.144
LIAM: Get you a woman who can do both!

2473
01:44:57.144 --> 01:45:00.144
[cheering]

2474
01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:04.750
MATT: All right, so, Fjord, it's your turn.

2475
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:05.900
TRAVIS: It's my turn?

2476
01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:10.380
I run in and try and find Caduceus in the throat

2477
01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:13.820
of the beheaded beast.
MATT: Okay.

2478
01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:15.670
Go ahead and make an athletics check.

2479
01:45:16.930 --> 01:45:17.830
SAM: Athletics?

2480
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:20.280
MATT: As you are climbing into, we'll put that there.

2481
01:45:21.650 --> 01:45:22.660
TRAVIS: 16.

2482
01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:23.560
SAM: Wow.
MATT: 16!

2483
01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.310
You manage to pull your way in.

2484
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:27.060
In doing so, you do take...

2485
01:45:30.850 --> 01:45:32.693
TRAVIS: Caduceus?!

2486
01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:37.020
MARISHA: You're not still invisible, right?

2487
01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:39.157
MATT: 26 points of acid damage.

2488
01:45:39.157 --> 01:45:39.990
[groaning]

2489
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:41.480
As even though its head is gone,

2490
01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.640
the inside of its body is still filled with digestive fluid

2491
01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:48.210
and you're like (sizzling) and you're pulling

2492
01:45:48.210 --> 01:45:50.270
and you get through to a point where,

2493
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:53.060
now, you feel the base of something's foot.

2494
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.360
You're pretty sure it's Caduceus.

2495
01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.660
TRAVIS: I hope this is Caduceus!

2496
01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:56.960
And I'll pull him out.

2497
01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.340
MATT: Well, that was your turn climbing into it.

2498
01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:01.232
TRAVIS: Oh, good, oh, fuck!

2499
01:46:01.232 --> 01:46:02.831
[laughter]

2500
01:46:02.831 --> 01:46:05.387
I think I've got him, but it burns!

2501
01:46:07.996 --> 01:46:09.650
MATT: That was your action, pushing in,

2502
01:46:09.650 --> 01:46:12.150
making your way inside the creature.

2503
01:46:12.150 --> 01:46:13.730
LAURA: And you're holding on to his foot.

2504
01:46:13.730 --> 01:46:15.530
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: Okay.

2505
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:17.777
TRAVIS: And screaming like a bitch.

2506
01:46:17.777 --> 01:46:20.390
MATT: (laughs) Beauregard, your turn.

2507
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:23.419
MARISHA: I vomit.

2508
01:46:23.419 --> 01:46:25.210
[laughter]

2509
01:46:25.210 --> 01:46:29.160
And my stumble forward going:

2510
01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.890
The worm, the friend, our cow,

2511
01:46:32.890 --> 01:46:34.650
he ate it and out of the bison

2512
01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.959
but Caduceus (mumbling)

2513
01:46:39.959 --> 01:46:43.260
get him and I just wrap my arms around Fjord

2514
01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:46.826
and I say: Pull, buddy, pull.

2515
01:46:46.826 --> 01:46:47.920
[laughter]

2516
01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.860
I want to help you.

2517
01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:53.350
MATT: So you're going to try and climb into the--

2518
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:54.750
MARISHA: No.

2519
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:56.993
MATT: You saw Fjord disappear into its open neck.

2520
01:46:56.993 --> 01:46:59.140
MARISHA: Wait, Fjord is gone, too?

2521
01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:01.420
Why do people keep disappearing in this thing?

2522
01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:02.910
MATT: It swallowed him into his body

2523
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:06.040
and the creature probably length-wise is about 30 feet long,

2524
01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.610
so Fjord had to climb about probably 10 feet or so

2525
01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:09.820
into its body to get to Caduceus.

2526
01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.340
LAURA: You have to climb in after Fjord--

2527
01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:15.530
MARISHA: No, I just go where's, this is ironic

2528
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:19.401
because Fjord would suck things into his body and now

2529
01:47:19.401 --> 01:47:24.401
he's being sucked into worms' bodies.

2530
01:47:25.028 --> 01:47:27.190
It feels like everything came full circle

2531
01:47:27.190 --> 01:47:29.970
and then I just collapse again and pass out.

2532
01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:33.260
MATT: All right, Beau passes out.

2533
01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:35.570
Caduceus.

2534
01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:36.730
Your turn.
TALIESIN: Okay.

2535
01:47:36.730 --> 01:47:38.260
MATT: You feel Fjord grabbing your foot.

2536
01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:39.093
TALIESIN: I'm going to start helping

2537
01:47:39.093 --> 01:47:40.468
and shoving us both back

2538
01:47:40.468 --> 01:47:42.870
because I assume it's let go, I mean,

2539
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:46.449
I assume it's no longer constricting me.

2540
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:50.460
MATT: You are currently, you are still blinded.

2541
01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:51.293
TALIESIN: Sure.

2542
01:47:52.585 --> 01:47:53.460
LIAM: Probably a muscular tunnel.

2543
01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:56.710
MATT: I'll say you're not restrained,

2544
01:47:56.710 --> 01:47:59.430
but any attempts to push your way out are at disadvantage.

2545
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:01.520
If you're trying to push your way out at this point,

2546
01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:04.140
go ahead and make a strength check

2547
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.170
or an athletics check with disadvantage.

2548
01:48:06.170 --> 01:48:07.450
TALIESIN: No, that doesn't sound like me.

2549
01:48:07.450 --> 01:48:10.730
What am I going to do?
[laughter]

2550
01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:15.920
LAURA: Do you heal yourself up so that--

2551
01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.640
TALIESIN: I can heal a couple of us if we have to, but

2552
01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.910
I know I'm getting pulled out, right?

2553
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:24.426
MATT: You feel something grab your foot

2554
01:48:24.426 --> 01:48:25.620
and you hear (mumbling).

2555
01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:27.909
TALIESIN: All right, that's good enough for me.

2556
01:48:27.909 --> 01:48:29.769
[laughter]

2557
01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:32.880
I'm going to heal myself then

2558
01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.140
for, where's my Cure Wounds?

2559
01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:38.473
There we go.

2560
01:48:38.473 --> 01:48:41.150
I'm going to heal myself at 3rd-level.

2561
01:48:41.150 --> 01:48:45.481
I know, I'm taking his, I'll heal for level three.

2562
01:48:45.481 --> 01:48:49.400
The periapt doesn't work, it's just on the, yeah, nevermind.

2563
01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.660
MATT: Yeah, you just take--
TALIESIN: So.

2564
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:53.200
It's these.
MATT: So 3d8

2565
01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:54.920
plus five, I believe.

2566
01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:57.290
TALIESIN: That's not bad, okay, 15 points.

2567
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:58.590
LAURA: Plus five?
MATT: So you healed 15?

2568
01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:01.460
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 15, I heal 15.

2569
01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:02.570
MATT: That's your action.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2570
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:04.420
MATT: Anything else?

2571
01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:07.283
TALIESIN: Let's see, let me just do that.

2572
01:49:07.283 --> 01:49:09.790
For bonus actions, I don't know if there's anything useful

2573
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:12.398
but let's take a look.

2574
01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:16.410
Yeah, bonus actions, no, I don't really have much.

2575
01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:19.620
I'm just going to yell out: All right, just keep pulling.

2576
01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.040
I'm going to try and make myself easy to pull.

2577
01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:25.710
MATT: All right so you just stretch yourself out.

2578
01:49:25.710 --> 01:49:27.720
Make it easier to pass a Caduceus.

2579
01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.610
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

2580
01:49:30.610 --> 01:49:33.020
TALIESIN: I'm not claustrophobic, I'm cool with this.

2581
01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:33.853
MATT: All right.

2582
01:49:33.853 --> 01:49:34.686
TRAVIS: That, wow, wow.

2583
01:49:34.686 --> 01:49:35.700
MATT: Caleb, your turn.

2584
01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.520
LIAM: Okay, I see this predicament in front of me and say:

2585
01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.390
Oh my god, vored like a sword and not by Fjord.

2586
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:45.290
The cat claw will move forward

2587
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:48.270
and slide one or two claws into the mouth of this thing,

2588
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:49.470
into the mandible.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2589
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:51.380
LIAM: Rip away the bottom jaw

2590
01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:53.810
and hopefully just tear down the front of its body

2591
01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:54.810
and open it up.

2592
01:49:54.810 --> 01:49:56.998
MATT: It's like the worst rectal exam.

2593
01:49:56.998 --> 01:50:00.347
[laughter]

2594
01:50:00.347 --> 01:50:02.474
Go ahead and roll damage.

2595
01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:12.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, rip open that muscular tunnel.

2596
01:50:12.450 --> 01:50:16.320
LAURA: Yeah, do some good damage to that muscular tunnel.

2597
01:50:17.303 --> 01:50:19.060
[laughter]

2598
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:21.550
SAM: Yeah!
LAURA: What?

2599
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:23.050
What did you mean?

2600
01:50:24.478 --> 01:50:26.890
SAM: Stick your finger into that--

2601
01:50:26.890 --> 01:50:29.360
LIAM: That is 20 points of rectal damage.

2602
01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.320
[laughter]

2603
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.690
MATT: Its jaw tears apart,

2604
01:50:33.690 --> 01:50:35.350
the inside of it burning away,

2605
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:37.320
the bits of gore slopping into the snow

2606
01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.640
and sizzling and hissing

2607
01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.950
as it begins to melt away into steam.

2608
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:44.210
You do see Fjord's lower half begin to emerge from it

2609
01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:45.080
and you now find your feet

2610
01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:47.000
actually getting some purchase on the ground.

2611
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.415
LAURA: Oh, good.
TRAVIS: I got him!

2612
01:50:49.415 --> 01:50:50.460
MATT: Nott, you're up.

2613
01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.750
Or are you done with your turn?

2614
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:53.470
LIAM: I'm holding my ground and waiting.

2615
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:54.590
MATT: You got it, Nott, you're up.

2616
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:57.170
SAM: Oh, boy.

2617
01:50:57.170 --> 01:50:58.430
I can see a foot?

2618
01:50:58.430 --> 01:51:00.330
MATT: You can see the lower half of Fjord

2619
01:51:00.330 --> 01:51:02.310
now pulling its way out of the remnants

2620
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:03.610
of what its head once were.

2621
01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:06.190
SAM: All right, I'll run over and grab,

2622
01:51:06.190 --> 01:51:09.030
grab that boot and I'll pull.
MATT: All right.

2623
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:10.920
Go ahead and make an athletics check.

2624
01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:14.990
SAM: Athletics?

2625
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:16.980
11.

2626
01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:19.647
TRAVIS: Strange, I seem to do better than that.

2627
01:51:19.647 --> 01:51:22.647
[laughter]

2628
01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:31.168
SAM: I will push it deeper into the--

2629
01:51:31.168 --> 01:51:33.668
MATT: (laughs)

2630
01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:41.780
MATT: All right, so, Fjord, you get a couple inches out

2631
01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.360
and then about another couple inches

2632
01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.890
get shoved back into the wound.

2633
01:51:44.890 --> 01:51:46.210
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

2634
01:51:46.210 --> 01:51:47.070
Pull!
SAM: I don't know,

2635
01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:49.838
I don't know how to do this!

2636
01:51:51.311 --> 01:51:53.470
I'll just spend the rest of my turn drinking.

2637
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:55.690
MATT: Okay.
[laughter]

2638
01:51:55.690 --> 01:51:57.240
LIAM: Your head's in an esophageus.

2639
01:51:58.155 --> 01:52:00.460
MATT: All right, Caduceus,

2640
01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:02.990
at the top of what would be the corpse's turn.

2641
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:06.650
You take another 21 points of acid damage.

2642
01:52:06.650 --> 01:52:07.483
TALIESIN: Cool.

2643
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:09.920
I ain't bothered.

2644
01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:10.850
SAM: You're dead?
TALIESIN: Nope.

2645
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:12.690
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no, no.
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

2646
01:52:12.690 --> 01:52:13.523
LAURA: He healed himself.

2647
01:52:13.523 --> 01:52:14.390
MATT: Jester, your turn.

2648
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:16.880
LAURA: I'm going to run up and try to yank them out.

2649
01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.940
MATT: Make an athletics check.

2650
01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:19.832
LAURA: Well, all right.

2651
01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:24.460
At advantage because I'm really high on my kills?

2652
01:52:25.295 --> 01:52:27.040
[laughter]

2653
01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:27.873
MATT: Nah.

2654
01:52:28.931 --> 01:52:30.947
LAURA: That's okay, I didn't need it, that's a 20.

2655
01:52:30.947 --> 01:52:33.611
[cheering]

2656
01:52:33.611 --> 01:52:35.330
MATT: As Nott and Fjord are struggling,

2657
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:37.520
Jester waltzes up and grabs the back of Fjord's pants

2658
01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.950
and just one big (whooshes),

2659
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:42.630
yanks both him and Caduceus out (thumps)

2660
01:52:42.630 --> 01:52:45.200
like some extremely aggressive birth.

2661
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:50.200
[cheering]

2662
01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:54.522
SAM: Call the midwife!

2663
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:56.850
TALIESIN: Anyone down?

2664
01:52:56.850 --> 01:52:58.000
Is there anyone down?

2665
01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.020
I'm just sitting up.

2666
01:52:59.020 --> 01:52:59.853
Anybody down?

2667
01:52:59.853 --> 01:53:02.640
MATT: You see Beau is passed out in the snow.

2668
01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:05.660
TALIESIN: I immediately am going to cast, oh, God,

2669
01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:07.382
Spare the Dying on her.

2670
01:53:07.382 --> 01:53:09.357
[laughter]
MATT: Okay.

2671
01:53:09.357 --> 01:53:11.900
SAM: She's not, she's not dying.
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

2672
01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:12.910
She looks bad.
LAURA: She's just kind of

2673
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:14.640
passed--
SAM: She's just being dramatic.

2674
01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:16.620
TRAVIS: What about yourself?

2675
01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.710
You were inside the throat of that creature.

2676
01:53:18.710 --> 01:53:19.930
Are you all right?

2677
01:53:19.930 --> 01:53:24.330
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm all right.
[laughter]

2678
01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:26.060
SAM: Fjord!

2679
01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:30.006
You were incredible!

2680
01:53:30.006 --> 01:53:34.482
[cheering]

2681
01:53:34.482 --> 01:53:39.257
[cheering]

2682
01:53:40.385 --> 01:53:43.938
You were pulling that load with such torque.

2683
01:53:43.938 --> 01:53:46.220
It was amazing!

2684
01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.260
You had four on the floor and you were just.

2685
01:53:50.851 --> 01:53:54.500
You were stronger now

2686
01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.455
than you've ever been before.

2687
01:53:57.850 --> 01:54:02.840
If, if I weren't married.
[laughter]

2688
01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:07.840
[cheering]

2689
01:54:08.531 --> 01:54:11.031
MATT: (laughs)

2690
01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:17.410
SAM: Also, if you had bull legs and a human torso.

2691
01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.530
LIAM: While this conversation is going on,

2692
01:54:20.530 --> 01:54:23.400
the cat claw sort of disdainfully picks up the insect

2693
01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:26.471
and drops it in the hole and just goes (thumping).

2694
01:54:26.471 --> 01:54:29.209
MATT: (splurting)

2695
01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:31.050
Its body awkwardly stuffed

2696
01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:32.550
into the remnants of its hole.

2697
01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:35.230
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

2698
01:54:35.230 --> 01:54:36.983
LAURA: We need to heal.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2699
01:54:36.983 --> 01:54:39.550
I'm going to sit down and start a Prayer of Healing,

2700
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:41.300
if we've got a minute.

2701
01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.516
LAURA: We should take maybe, like, a short rest.

2702
01:54:44.516 --> 01:54:46.611
TRAVIS: Long rest, at least, yes.

2703
01:54:46.611 --> 01:54:48.130
[laughter]

2704
01:54:48.130 --> 01:54:49.200
LAURA: At least a short.

2705
01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.900
SAM: We hiked for an hour?
[laughter]

2706
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.621
MATT: This was a few hours into your day.

2707
01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:56.693
SAM: Oh, okay.
MATT: I'd say you got about maybe

2708
01:54:56.693 --> 01:54:59.650
say half a day's travel.
SAM: Okay.

2709
01:54:59.650 --> 01:55:01.830
LAURA: Short rest, let's take an hour

2710
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:04.640
and just sit here for maybe an hour?

2711
01:55:06.824 --> 01:55:08.650
TALIESIN: I mean, we can.

2712
01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:10.830
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Short rest, long rest?

2713
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:13.247
TALIESIN: I don't, well.
MARISHA: I'm still unconscious.

2714
01:55:13.247 --> 01:55:15.580
[laughter]

2715
01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:18.000
TRAVIS: Do your thing and then we'll see where we're at.

2716
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.160
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take

2717
01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:23.160
10 minutes to just do a Prayer of Healing at level three.

2718
01:55:24.129 --> 01:55:24.962
MATT: All right.

2719
01:55:24.962 --> 01:55:27.395
TALIESIN: Because we're burning through them today.

2720
01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:31.000
That's, where's my other d8?

2721
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.059
There we go.
TRAVIS: That fucking sucked.

2722
01:55:33.059 --> 01:55:34.410
MARISHA: Yeah.

2723
01:55:34.410 --> 01:55:36.670
TALIESIN: That's okay.

2724
01:55:36.670 --> 01:55:38.900
Everybody gets 19 points back.

2725
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:42.010
MATT: Not bad.
[applause]

2726
01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:47.640
LAURA: Still feeling pretty rough.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2727
01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:51.220
SAM: We could probably make it.

2728
01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:52.220
LAURA: Sure.

2729
01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:54.880
We just run into another one of those worms,

2730
01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:56.800
we all die immediately, no big deal.

2731
01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:00.080
TRAVIS: For just a moment, we were moving through the trees,

2732
01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:02.460
it came from underneath the ground.

2733
01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.630
Is there any reason that we should

2734
01:56:03.630 --> 01:56:04.920
move up to the side of the mountain

2735
01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:06.810
and take the mountainside around?

2736
01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:08.790
TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea, actually.

2737
01:56:09.728 --> 01:56:11.370
SAM: But that's where the watchtower is, right?

2738
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:12.250
TRAVIS: It's closer to it.

2739
01:56:12.250 --> 01:56:14.890
We'd be out in the open, but I feel like those things

2740
01:56:14.890 --> 01:56:17.170
could feel where we were coming from.

2741
01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:20.718
TALIESIN: That's really pretty smart, actually, I think.

2742
01:56:20.718 --> 01:56:21.860
I don't know.

2743
01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:25.172
SAM: You know, he sounds smarter now, too.

2744
01:56:25.172 --> 01:56:28.172
[laughter]

2745
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:33.410
It's weird.

2746
01:56:33.410 --> 01:56:35.320
Everything you say, just say biscuit.

2747
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.082
TRAVIS: Biscuit.
SAM: It's amazing.

2748
01:56:40.082 --> 01:56:42.482
TALIESIN: I suddenly want biscuits now, yeah.

2749
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:45.970
TRAVIS: So the mountainside, is it worth it?

2750
01:56:45.970 --> 01:56:48.706
Or do we keep going this way?

2751
01:56:48.706 --> 01:56:51.400
TALIESIN: (sighs) I don't think we can

2752
01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:54.560
survive another one of those without a long rest, so.

2753
01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:55.927
TRAVIS: I don't either.

2754
01:56:57.012 --> 01:56:59.679
MARISHA: (gasps)

2755
01:57:01.034 --> 01:57:02.510
TRAVIS: Hello?

2756
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:03.730
MARISHA: Did you die too?

2757
01:57:03.730 --> 01:57:05.430
Who all died? Raise their hand.

2758
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:08.905
TRAVIS: So many died. So many.
LAURA: Everybody did, Beau.

2759
01:57:08.905 --> 01:57:10.350
You were not alone.
TRAVIS: All of us died.

2760
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:12.510
Caduceus saved us all, thank god.

2761
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:14.420
MARISHA: Wow.
LAURA: If we take a short rest

2762
01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:15.370
we can heal up, though.

2763
01:57:15.370 --> 01:57:18.070
SAM: Okay, we can short rest it.
LAURA: Just an hour?

2764
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:19.015
SAM: Yeah.

2765
01:57:19.015 --> 01:57:20.710
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm great, I'm good.

2766
01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:23.950
We can go right now if we really wanted to.

2767
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:26.200
MATT: You have about three more hours of daylight,

2768
01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.167
essentially, to travel.

2769
01:57:28.167 --> 01:57:31.607
TALIESIN: We could take the mountain for two more hours

2770
01:57:31.607 --> 01:57:36.490
and set up camp and if we see anything iffy, just.

2771
01:57:36.490 --> 01:57:38.870
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2772
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:41.490
TALIESIN: Unless you want to pull
another 10 minutes to heal.

2773
01:57:41.490 --> 01:57:43.640
Do you have a mass or?

2774
01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.230
LIAM: Caleb steps aside to Nott. Were you hurt much?

2775
01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:50.880
SAM: Was I hurt much?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

2776
01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:52.830
SAM: No, I'm okay, I'm all right.

2777
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:56.030
I'm fine, are you all right?

2778
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:59.326
LIAM: Not a scratch.
[laughter]

2779
01:57:59.326 --> 01:58:04.226
[cheering]

2780
01:58:04.226 --> 01:58:09.226
[cheering]

2781
01:58:10.562 --> 01:58:11.973
MATT: I'm going to make a note of that.

2782
01:58:11.973 --> 01:58:13.680
[laughter]

2783
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:18.010
LIAM: Give me one game, one game.

2784
01:58:18.010 --> 01:58:20.260
LAURA: I mean, I can cast Pass Without a Trace on us

2785
01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:22.540
and try to be a little more stealthy, you know?

2786
01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:25.660
So maybe we can make less of a rumble

2787
01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:27.870
as we walk across the ground and stuff.

2788
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:30.120
TRAVIS: That's a great idea, yes.
LAURA: Okay.

2789
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.180
I'll do that.

2790
01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:32.200
I don't have any healing spells

2791
01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:33.840
other than Cure Wounds, though.

2792
01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.340
SAM: You're a cleric?

2793
01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:36.490
TALIESIN: I cast Mass Cure Wounds,

2794
01:58:36.490 --> 01:58:39.420
so that was a lot faster anyway.

2795
01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:42.380
MARISHA: Yeah, you do know that Cure Wounds is like

2796
01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:45.590
<i>the</i> healing spell more or less.

2797
01:58:45.590 --> 01:58:47.740
LAURA: I brought her back, she died, I brought her back.

2798
01:58:49.005 --> 01:58:50.290
Did you see that?

2799
01:58:50.290 --> 01:58:54.350
SAM: No, I was fleeing.
[laughter]

2800
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:55.760
LAURA: I did it.

2801
01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:58.089
I also killed those fucking things, but no big deal.

2802
01:58:58.089 --> 01:59:00.687
(laughter)

2803
01:59:00.687 --> 01:59:05.687
[cheering]

2804
01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:08.060
SAM: Fair point.

2805
01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:10.660
TALIESIN: I mean, it'll tap out my spells,

2806
01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:13.490
but I can do another, not entirely, but it'll, you know--

2807
01:59:13.490 --> 01:59:14.460
TRAVIS: No, no, save them.

2808
01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:17.010
Cast Without a Trace, seems like a great idea.

2809
01:59:17.010 --> 01:59:17.843
LAURA: Sure.

2810
01:59:18.688 --> 01:59:19.860
MATT: You're Pass Without a Tracing?

2811
01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:21.030
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2812
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:22.120
MATT: All right, two to three more hours to travel,

2813
01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:24.940
lasts for an hour, how many times can you cast it?

2814
01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:26.940
LAURA: I can cast it three times.

2815
01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:29.330
MATT: Well, then, I'll allow a single stealth check

2816
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:32.310
from all of you guys, not with advantage,

2817
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:35.090
with the bonuses of that.
LAURA: Okay.

2818
01:59:35.090 --> 01:59:37.120
So I cast it three times.

2819
01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:38.770
MATT: You cast it three times in a row for three hours,

2820
01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:40.040
so all of you go ahead and make your stealth check

2821
01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:41.330
and this will be for all three hours

2822
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:43.457
as opposed to making it separately for each hour.

2823
01:59:43.457 --> 01:59:46.920
MARISHA: If you roll just hypothetical.

2824
01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.628
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2825
01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.553
MARISHA: If you roll a one,

2826
01:59:51.553 --> 01:59:53.470
do you still get to add the plus 10

2827
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:55.430
or do you still fail?

2828
01:59:55.430 --> 02:00:00.200
MATT: It's still a natural one?
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one.

2829
02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.270
MATT: But it's an 11 and a natural one.

2830
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:04.650
MARISHA: Do I get to add my stealth too?

2831
02:00:04.650 --> 02:00:06.030
LIAM: Did you roll at advantage?

2832
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:07.490
MATT: Yeah, add your stealth, too.

2833
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:09.223
MARISHA: Wait, it's not advantage.

2834
02:00:09.223 --> 02:00:10.056
MATT: No one's rolling at advantage

2835
02:00:10.056 --> 02:00:11.000
unless you have something that allows you to.

2836
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.370
Everybody gets a plus 10 because of the spell.

2837
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:13.203
LIAM: Oh, okay, okay.

2838
02:00:13.203 --> 02:00:14.036
MARISHA: So 20.

2839
02:00:15.442 --> 02:00:17.446
MATT: 20.
MARISHA: My stealth is plus nine.

2840
02:00:17.446 --> 02:00:18.510
MATT: With a natural one, good to know.

2841
02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:19.510
All right, Caleb.

2842
02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:24.450
Caleb?
LIAM: 17.

2843
02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:25.710
TRAVIS: 27.

2844
02:00:25.710 --> 02:00:26.860
MATT: 27.
TALIESIN: 29.

2845
02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:28.490
MATT: 29.
LAURA: 24.

2846
02:00:28.490 --> 02:00:29.323
MATT: 24.

2847
02:00:29.323 --> 02:00:32.375
SAM: Natural 20, so 43.

2848
02:00:32.375 --> 02:00:37.258
[cheering]

2849
02:00:40.965 --> 02:00:43.449
LAURA: 28, I was wrong, 28.

2850
02:00:43.449 --> 02:00:44.960
MATT: All right, as you guys are carefully making your way

2851
02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.450
around the side of the mountain,

2852
02:00:46.450 --> 02:00:49.030
Beau is about to step on

2853
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:52.764
a pile of dry, rotted sticks

2854
02:00:52.764 --> 02:00:55.198
and right as she goes to step,

2855
02:00:55.198 --> 02:00:57.320
Nott is so stealthy--
SAM: (caws)

2856
02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:00.240
MATT: Nott swoops in, grabs the bottom of her foot,

2857
02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:02.660
and adjusts it off of it and manages to make up for it.

2858
02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:04.642
You guys manage to move forward unnoticed.

2859
02:01:04.642 --> 02:01:09.342
[cheering]

2860
02:01:11.572 --> 02:01:13.520
TRAVIS: Are you all right, you okay?
SAM: I got you, boo.

2861
02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:15.580
LAURA: She doesn't die every day, you know.

2862
02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:16.700
TRAVIS: That's true, yes.

2863
02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:18.790
SAM: Watch out for the--
LAURA: You didn't die-die, Beau.

2864
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:22.043
You just went unconscious.
MARISHA: Uh-huh, yeah.

2865
02:01:22.043 --> 02:01:23.460
MATT: All right, as you guys continue on

2866
02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:26.980
for the next three hours, undetected, without issue,

2867
02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:29.600
you eventually watch as the light in the sky

2868
02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:31.580
grows darker and darker, forcing you to make camp.

2869
02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:32.990
Are you making it on the mountainside

2870
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:35.190
or the forest side or right on the treeline?

2871
02:01:37.110 --> 02:01:38.560
TRAVIS: I would vote treeline, but.

2872
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:40.780
SAM: I'll go with Fjord.

2873
02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:42.130
He's been very lucky today.

2874
02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.880
LAURA: Can you make your thingy, Caleb?

2875
02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.260
LIAM: I can, but you are not worried

2876
02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:48.780
in the treeline about things coming up from beneath?

2877
02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:50.997
TRAVIS: I thought it was--
LIAM: No.

2878
02:01:50.997 --> 02:01:54.870
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking nope.
[laughter]

2879
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:58.140
LIAM: No, but I could have it match

2880
02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:00.060
the color of the mountainside.

2881
02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:02.620
SAM: We could find a rock to sleep on.

2882
02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:04.650
A rock or like a big boulder or something.

2883
02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:06.420
TALIESIN: Well, the mountain's kind of.

2884
02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:09.003
SAM: Or the mountain, yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2885
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:11.920
MATT: Fucking mountain.

2886
02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:13.420
TRAVIS: We should check the mountain to make sure

2887
02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:15.870
it's actually rock or granite and not soil

2888
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:17.540
or something that could be burrowed through.

2889
02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:19.360
SAM: All right.
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

2890
02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.060
MATT: All right, who's checking for that?

2891
02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:23.970
SAM: I will poke the mountain.
[laughter]

2892
02:02:23.970 --> 02:02:26.760
MATT: Make a nature check for me.

2893
02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:31.701
SAM: Nine.

2894
02:02:31.701 --> 02:02:33.201
AUDIENCE: Nein!

2895
02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.000
MATT: Nott eventually finds a nice, solid patch

2896
02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.150
of stone.
TRAVIS: Of stone.

2897
02:02:39.150 --> 02:02:41.760
SAM: I think, at least two inches down, yeah.

2898
02:02:43.690 --> 02:02:45.960
I just probed two inches down.

2899
02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:47.650
TRAVIS: What did you use?

2900
02:02:47.650 --> 02:02:49.165
SAM: My finger.

2901
02:02:49.165 --> 02:02:51.730
[laughter]

2902
02:02:51.730 --> 02:02:54.540
LIAM: Caduceus, you are used to living out of doors.

2903
02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:57.132
Is this the best spot, what do you think?

2904
02:02:59.838 --> 02:03:01.238
TALIESIN: I mean.

2905
02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:03.560
SAM: Seems confident.

2906
02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:06.940
LAURA: What if we climb up and we sleep in the trees?

2907
02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:09.470
That way we're not on the ground,

2908
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:11.440
the worm won't be able to hear us rumble.

2909
02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:13.660
SAM: The dome can't protect us in the trees.

2910
02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:16.110
LAURA: Yeah, but the trees can protect us in the trees.

2911
02:03:16.110 --> 02:03:17.118
TRAVIS: These sort of trees,

2912
02:03:17.118 --> 02:03:19.745
what's the lowest hanging branch?

2913
02:03:19.745 --> 02:03:21.160
How high?
MATT: As the pine trees,

2914
02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.540
they actually start at about, some of them,

2915
02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:27.800
like five, six feet and then higher from there.

2916
02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.880
Depending on the size of the tree,

2917
02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.223
the treeline, they're a little smaller,

2918
02:03:32.223 --> 02:03:33.700
so around four to five feet, they begin.

2919
02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:35.320
TRAVIS: I mean, we could.

2920
02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:37.503
MARISHA: Okay, a new pitch.

2921
02:03:37.503 --> 02:03:41.690
You, can you take your dome and put it upside down

2922
02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:43.780
and we hang it in the tree and then we all just

2923
02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:47.367
cradle together in the safety of a,

2924
02:03:47.367 --> 02:03:52.330
you know, a bowl?
[laughter]

2925
02:03:52.330 --> 02:03:53.920
I'm not thinking clearly.

2926
02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.360
LIAM: We need to find this woman a place to rest.

2927
02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:59.530
[laughter]

2928
02:03:59.530 --> 02:04:00.620
LAURA: At least it would keep things

2929
02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:03.006
from jumping up underneath us.

2930
02:04:03.006 --> 02:04:04.912
LIAM: I think it is a decent idea, yeah.

2931
02:04:04.912 --> 02:04:07.400
Maybe go a little deeper in to higher trees?

2932
02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:09.338
MARISHA: Wait, are you actually going to do this?

2933
02:04:09.338 --> 02:04:10.780
[laughter]

2934
02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:13.410
LIAM: No, it does not work that way, no,

2935
02:04:13.410 --> 02:04:15.590
but we could sleep in the branches.

2936
02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:18.514
I think either that, or we pick a spot on the hillside

2937
02:04:18.514 --> 02:04:20.990
and I throw up the dome.

2938
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:22.150
MATT: What are you guys doing?

2939
02:04:22.150 --> 02:04:24.960
LAURA: Go up the trees.
SAM: Into the trees!

2940
02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.810
MATT: All right.

2941
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:27.650
LAURA: Oh no.

2942
02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:29.840
MATT: It takes you guys a little bit of time

2943
02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:31.350
to try and find a patch of trees.

2944
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:33.770
How are you staying in the trees?

2945
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:37.190
LIAM: Well, I will-- hmm.

2946
02:04:37.190 --> 02:04:40.870
I will turn into that giant ape again only white this time

2947
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:43.730
and climb around and find a sturdy place

2948
02:04:43.730 --> 02:04:46.270
that can keep us relatively close together

2949
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:47.750
and ferry people up

2950
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:49.966
as needed.
MATT: Make a survival check.

2951
02:04:49.966 --> 02:04:53.633
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: Using the gorilla's wisdom.

2952
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:56.906
LAURA: Gorillas are so smart.

2953
02:04:56.906 --> 02:04:59.380
[groaning]

2954
02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:01.000
MATT: As you guys prepare camp

2955
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.430
within the first hour of nightfall,

2956
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:07.752
as you get comfortable and lay down, you hear (ticks).

2957
02:05:07.752 --> 02:05:12.752
(crunching) The whole canopy that you had set up camp

2958
02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:14.460
snaps and falls out from under you.

2959
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:16.908
You tumble about 10 feet.

2960
02:05:16.908 --> 02:05:18.140
MARISHA: What?

2961
02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:20.140
MATT: Everyone suffers six points of bludgeoning damage.

2962
02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:21.900
SAM: (groans)

2963
02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:25.160
MATT: Your treetop canopy has broken.

2964
02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:27.190
It has been an hour into night and you could hear

2965
02:05:27.190 --> 02:05:29.180
the various sounds of nocturnal creatures

2966
02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:31.020
beginning to come out--
TRAVIS: Mountainside, mountainside

2967
02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:31.930
sounds good, yes.

2968
02:05:31.930 --> 02:05:33.057
TRAVIS: Let's go to the mountainside.

2969
02:05:33.057 --> 02:05:35.180
Yes, let's go, quickly.

2970
02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:37.470
LIAM: Caleb just starts cursing heavily in Zemnian

2971
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:38.850
and is pulling out his spellbook

2972
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:41.220
and finds that spot and plants his butt down

2973
02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:44.310
and starts ritual casting the hut.

2974
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:46.770
MATT: You guys eventually gather yourselves

2975
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:51.520
to this spot chosen, Caleb finishes his incantation.

2976
02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:53.840
The dome encases you all for what

2977
02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:56.910
hopefully is an evening of well-earned rest

2978
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:59.376
as you all come to sleep,

2979
02:05:59.376 --> 02:06:00.559
we're going to take a break.

2980
02:06:00.559 --> 02:06:05.310
[cheering]

2981
02:06:06.552 --> 02:06:08.135
SAM: That was intense.

2982
02:06:09.806 --> 02:06:11.740
TRAVIS: What the fuck, man?!

2983
02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:15.210
MATT: (laughs) You guys didn't roll well for stealth and

2984
02:06:15.210 --> 02:06:17.105
on my table, I rolled that encounter.

2985
02:06:17.105 --> 02:06:19.538
TRAVIS: Your 6d10 can shove it!
MATT: I'm sorry.

2986
02:06:19.538 --> 02:06:21.500
Anyway, we'll be back here in a little bit.

2987
02:06:21.500 --> 02:06:23.990
Guys, enjoy your break at home and here in the theater.

2988
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:27.025
We'll see you for the second half of this adventure shortly.

2989
02:06:27.025 --> 02:06:29.313

AMANDA: And that kind of validation,

3009
02:07:19.522 --> 02:07:23.463
especially after being a fringe,

3010
02:07:23.463 --> 02:07:26.496
maligned weirdo,

3011
02:07:26.496 --> 02:07:29.650
always other kind of kid

3012
02:07:29.650 --> 02:07:32.835
and then in a band that was always, like--

3013
02:07:32.835 --> 02:07:35.970
we were the weird ones. We were never cool.

3014
02:07:35.970 --> 02:07:37.430
We were The Dresden Dolls.

3015
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:40.492
The Boston music scene hated us.

3016
02:07:40.492 --> 02:07:43.440
We were the gay mime band.
BRIAN: Mm-hm.

3017
02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:45.880
AMANDA: We were never invited to the party.

3018
02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.100
BRIAN: Yeah.
AMANDA: Ever.

3019
02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:48.910
BRIAN: Yeah.
AMANDA: And we were,

3020
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:52.280
you know, we were a posse and we were like fuck your party.

3021
02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:54.685
We have our own party.

3022
02:07:54.685 --> 02:07:56.560
A party where everything is allowed,

3023
02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:59.030
everyone belongs. We're allowed to have feelings.

3024
02:07:59.030 --> 02:08:02.540
Fuck your system, fuck being cool, fuck your plaid shirts.

3025
02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:04.090
We're not going to stare at our shoes.

3026
02:08:04.090 --> 02:08:07.330
We're going to look at you and be like us doing this now,

3027
02:08:07.330 --> 02:08:11.130
family, community, punk rock, here, let's do it.

3028
02:08:11.130 --> 02:08:13.650
Like have a feather boa, here's a drink.

3029
02:08:13.650 --> 02:08:14.739
Let's do this shit.

3030
02:08:14.739 --> 02:08:19.606
(speakeasy music)

3031
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.820
BRIAN (VO): Last time on Talks Machina.

3032
02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:29.290
BRIAN: Chris, our sound guy, got engaged last week.

3033
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:30.510
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!
BRIAN: Chris,

3034
02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:32.370
can you come out here for just a sec, buddy?

3035
02:08:32.370 --> 02:08:34.000
He's been asking to come on camera

3036
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.260
and we just haven't had an organic moment.

3037
02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:37.830
The mics'll be fine, buddy.

3038
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:40.492
We're just going to keep talking at this volume.

3039
02:08:40.492 --> 02:08:42.300
TRAVIS: Get out here!

3040
02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:45.400
BRIAN: Chris is our sound guys for Talks, Critical Role,

3041
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.375
Between the Sheets, almost everything

3042
02:08:47.375 --> 02:08:48.208
we do here.
TRAVIS: Come on!

3043
02:08:48.208 --> 02:08:49.240
Get over here!
BRIAN: Get your ass over here!

3044
02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:51.820
Sit down, sit down, right here between these--

3045
02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:53.240
at the end of this thing.
TALIESIN: Right there.

3046
02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:54.073
BRIAN: Hi, Chris.

3047
02:08:54.073 --> 02:08:55.230
Now you're going to have to talk pretty close

3048
02:08:55.230 --> 02:08:57.210
into Taliesin's chest.
CHRIS: Hello.

3049
02:08:57.210 --> 02:09:00.590
BRIAN: Hey, you got engaged, man. Congratulations.

3050
02:09:00.590 --> 02:09:02.190
CHRIS: Thank you.

3051
02:09:02.190 --> 02:09:04.120
BRIAN: How long have you and your lady been together?

3052
02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:05.620
CHRIS: About nine years now.

3053
02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:07.240
BRIAN: Nine years!
TRAVIS: Wow, congrats!

3054
02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:08.920
BRIAN: Jiminy Christmas.
TALIESIN: Awesome.

3055
02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:11.426
BRIAN: So why now? Did we give

3056
02:09:11.426 --> 02:09:13.580
you a raise or something and finally?
CHRIS: Uh, no

3057
02:09:13.580 --> 02:09:17.538
Contract trial is up.
BRIAN: You had a nine year

3058
02:09:17.538 --> 02:09:20.426
trial contract.
CHRIS: Now we can fully

3059
02:09:20.426 --> 02:09:21.700
get married.
BRIAN: If only Ashley

3060
02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:23.743
knew about those before we met.

3061
02:09:23.743 --> 02:09:24.649
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3062
02:09:24.649 --> 02:09:26.340
BRIAN: It would have been a much different story.

3063
02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:27.310
Dude, congrats, man.

3064
02:09:27.310 --> 02:09:28.740
CHRIS: Well, thank you, guys, very much.

3065
02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:30.150
TRAVIS: Yeah.
BRIAN: Chris ends up

3066
02:09:30.150 --> 02:09:32.130
getting some love on Reddit, which is awesome,

3067
02:09:32.130 --> 02:09:33.780
but he deserves a lot of love

3068
02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:36.110
for how much you contribute to all the shows and

3069
02:09:36.110 --> 02:09:37.280
you can really tell the difference

3070
02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:39.690
when Chris isn't here during some episodes.

3071
02:09:39.690 --> 02:09:40.600
TRAVIS: Yeah.
BRIAN: But, anyway,

3072
02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:43.015
get your ass out of here, man. That was enough.

3073
02:09:43.015 --> 02:09:44.123
Fuck him.

3074
02:09:44.123 --> 02:09:46.340
Does it help that it's your wife?

3075
02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:50.440
TRAVIS: Well (sighs), no.

3076
02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:53.740
Laura's just a fucking amazing performer, like, period.

3077
02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:58.050
Like whether, you know, anything scripted or unscripted.

3078
02:09:58.050 --> 02:09:59.970
Man, nobody catches the ball and throws it back

3079
02:09:59.970 --> 02:10:03.130
better than she does, that's just for damn sure.

3080
02:10:03.130 --> 02:10:05.960
She's so keyed into what's going on.

3081
02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:09.190
That's an asset for any sort of a

3082
02:10:09.190 --> 02:10:10.460
improv scene you're trying to score.

3083
02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:11.980
BRIAN: We know you're watching, Laura,

3084
02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:13.683
and we just want you to know

3085
02:10:13.683 --> 02:10:17.030
we appreciate you and all these things we're saying,

3086
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:18.538
we really mean.

3087
02:10:21.085 --> 02:10:23.290
TALIESIN: (snorts, laughs)

3088
02:10:23.290 --> 02:10:24.998
BRIAN: Taliesin figured out Molly's accent

3089
02:10:24.998 --> 02:10:25.839
the night he died.

3090
02:10:25.839 --> 02:10:29.000
TALIESIN: Like 35 beautiful minutes.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3091
02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.180
35 beautiful minutes.

3092
02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:32.356
Oh, yeah, I really feel like I'm getting the hang of--

3093
02:10:32.356 --> 02:10:34.350
oh, fuck.

3094
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:38.030
BRIAN: And then Ashly Burch came along and--

3095
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:43.030
TALIESIN: Ashly texted me at Comic Con and sent a little,

3096
02:10:43.170 --> 02:10:47.125
"there's a you-know-who cosplayer on the train."

3097
02:10:47.125 --> 02:10:48.060
"Have they noticed you?"

3098
02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:50.107
"They have not ID'd me as the murderer."

3099
02:10:50.107 --> 02:10:52.230
(laughter)

3100
02:10:52.230 --> 02:10:54.045
BRIAN: No way.

3101
02:10:55.414 --> 02:10:56.372
Ashly.

3102
02:10:56.372 --> 02:10:57.720
DANI: We don't blame you, Ashly.

3103
02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:01.030
BRIAN: Ashly, I only bring that up every couple of weeks

3104
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:02.890
just so we get tweets.
TRAVIS: And she goes, "No.

3105
02:11:02.890 --> 02:11:04.248
"I just stood there."

3106
02:11:04.248 --> 02:11:06.831
(laughter)

3107
02:11:08.305 --> 02:11:11.050
BRIAN: That's hilarious.
TALIESIN: I feel so bad.

3108
02:11:11.050 --> 02:11:13.580
BRIAN: Taliesin, "This episode was one of the few times

3109
02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:16.570
"we've seen Caduceus show emotional vulnerability--"

3110
02:11:16.570 --> 02:11:20.000
vulnerability. I haven't been drinking since this morning.

3111
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.570
Drinking since last night.

3112
02:11:21.570 --> 02:11:23.840
"--vulnerability about his personal issues.

3113
02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.510
"How has he been coping

3114
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:28.720
"with not being around his family for so long?"

3115
02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:30.680
We were just talking about this is the longest he's--

3116
02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.230
but how is he coping with it?

3117
02:11:32.230 --> 02:11:33.990
TALIESIN: He's coping with it A because, thankfully,

3118
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:35.570
everybody around him is a mess,

3119
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:37.400
which there's nothing more,

3120
02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.110
and I think this is true of anybody,

3121
02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:42.350
there is nothing more calming than other people's problems.

3122
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:47.190
Other people's problems are just a delightful distraction.

3123
02:11:47.190 --> 02:11:52.100
A real, especially after nearly dying,

3124
02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:55.583
tripling down on the I am on a mission from God,

3125
02:11:55.583 --> 02:11:59.040
from the Goddess herself to go save the world

3126
02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:01.850
and save my home and save everything and

3127
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:04.370
realizing that if all of this gets taken care of,

3128
02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:06.410
everything gets to go back to normal.

3129
02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:08.160
That's-- it's that notion of

3130
02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:09.640
if we just keep moving forward,

3131
02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:12.088
at the end of this, I get rewarded with

3132
02:12:12.088 --> 02:12:13.940
everything going back to the way it was.

3133
02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:15.350
BRIAN: Yes.
TALIESIN: So I mean,

3134
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:18.160
it's really just that idea that there's no other way

3135
02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.900
to get to normality than to just keep pushing forward.

3136
02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:24.928
BRIAN: Zach, do you have the PTZ ready to go?

3137
02:12:24.928 --> 02:12:29.310
Has anything ever summed up Critical Role

3138
02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:31.450
more than this pile here?
TALIESIN: Oh, that.

3139
02:12:31.450 --> 02:12:33.150
BRIAN: Has anything summed up Critical Role

3140
02:12:33.150 --> 02:12:35.460
more than what you see on the ground right there?

3141
02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:37.400
DANI: You're showing the magic.

3142
02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:40.040
TRAVIS: Dollar, dollar bills, decapitated llama,

3143
02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:43.980
Jester, a flask, and a katana, and a parrot?

3144
02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:48.820
BRIAN: Two flasks, a pillow with my face on it.

3145
02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:49.653
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

3146
02:12:49.653 --> 02:12:51.860
BRIAN: It's just kind of-- that's so wonderful.

3147
02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:53.130
That's how things go sometimes.

3148
02:12:53.130 --> 02:12:55.370
TALIESIN: The llama head really ties it together.

3149
02:12:57.363 --> 02:12:59.796
(static crackling)

3150
02:12:59.796 --> 02:13:04.604

02:14:36.356 --> 02:14:39.375
Oh, that's not a question.

3153
02:14:40.570 --> 02:14:42.430
Whether it 'tis nobler in the mind

3154
02:14:42.430 --> 02:14:47.425
to ponder the pros and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime

3155
02:14:48.550 --> 02:14:51.120
or to take hands and gift new subs

3156
02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:54.095
to Critters who find they can't afford them.

3157
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:56.866
To play.

3158
02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:00.893
To sleep.

3159
02:15:02.190 --> 02:15:03.681
No more.

3160
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:08.330
And by a sleep to say the cast and crew of Critical Role

3161
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:11.030
might find their naps around the hectic schedule

3162
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:13.810

No sleep, but just to stream.

3166
02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:35.338
Aye, there's the rub.

3167
02:15:35.338 --> 02:15:40.327
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

3169
02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:48.560
Do we got that?

3170
02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:50.992
Oh, that is Twitch poetry.

3171
02:15:53.523 --> 02:15:57.570
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

3172
02:15:57.570 --> 02:15:59.640
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe,

3173
02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:03.426
gift some subscriptions-- you, you got it.

3174
02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:12.075
Wrong soliloquy for the skull, but that's fucking good.

3179

TALIESIN: Oh, no, oh, no.

3180
02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:05.870
MATT: I do quickly want to point out

3181
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:07.720
that I think I've had this mini for close to

3182
02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:10.790
eight or more years and it finally got used tonight,

3183
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:13.539
so I'm happy about that.
[cheering]

3184
02:29:13.539 --> 02:29:14.826
TRAVIS: What is that?

3185
02:29:14.826 --> 02:29:15.724
MATT: It's a remorhaz.

3186
02:29:15.724 --> 02:29:17.800
LIAM: Remorazz, remorizz?

3187
02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:18.730
MATT: Yeah, remorhaz.

3188
02:29:18.730 --> 02:29:20.090
TRAVIS: Sure it is.
MATT: They're fun.

3189
02:29:20.090 --> 02:29:22.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, fun, fun.
TALIESIN: Are they?

3190
02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:24.690
MATT: Eight years I've been waiting to--

3191
02:29:24.690 --> 02:29:29.690
SAM: Matt, there's no giveaway tonight but I,

3192
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.375
I'm going to give away something.

3193
02:29:32.375 --> 02:29:33.380
[exclamations]

3194
02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:37.610
Would the person in seat double D-- thank you.

3195
02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:41.940
DD9 look under their seat

3196
02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:44.710
and they'll get a little special something

3197
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:47.818
courtesy of the cast of Critical Role.

3198
02:29:47.818 --> 02:29:52.818

3199
02:29:53.310 --> 02:29:54.350
SAM: That's it.

3200
02:29:54.350 --> 02:29:57.180
MATT: Wherever you are in the dark abyss before us,

3201
02:29:57.180 --> 02:30:02.180
DD9, congratulations (laughs).
[cheering]

3202
02:30:02.410 --> 02:30:04.345
SAM: Back in the bad seats.

3203
02:30:05.580 --> 02:30:07.744
I mean, the far seats.

3204
02:30:07.744 --> 02:30:09.770
MATT and LAURA: (laugh)

3205
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:11.308
TALIESIN: I like balcony.

3206
02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:15.090
MATT: Perfect.

3207
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:18.210
LAURA: How'd that rest go?

3208
02:30:18.210 --> 02:30:20.380
Did we rest, did we rest?
MARISHA: We took a long rest.

3209
02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:23.820
MATT: You guys, safe within the dome created by Caleb,

3210
02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:25.710
complete a long rest without issue.

3211
02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:28.126
Go ahead and mark that on your character sheets.

3212
02:30:28.126 --> 02:30:31.134
LIAM: Holla!

3213
02:30:32.570 --> 02:30:34.440
MARISHA: Wow.
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

3214
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:37.500
I'm going to manage some spells

3215
02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:40.015
while we got a second.
LAURA: Yeah, same, same, same!

3216
02:30:40.015 --> 02:30:42.765
TALIESIN: I'm reevaluating a lot of things.

3217
02:30:44.530 --> 02:30:47.190
MATT: You now have about one more days of travel

3218
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:49.570
should you continue at the pace you've been going,

3219
02:30:49.570 --> 02:30:52.370
uninterrupted.

3220
02:30:53.359 --> 02:30:55.440
Are you guys moving with the same strategic grouping?

3221
02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:57.720
The same marching order?

3222
02:30:57.720 --> 02:30:59.500
TALIESIN: It worked out okay.

3223
02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:02.350
TRAVIS: I don't think we need to protect the middle,

3224
02:31:02.350 --> 02:31:04.559
I think, yeah.

3225
02:31:04.559 --> 02:31:06.350
It's all right.

3226
02:31:06.350 --> 02:31:08.580
MARISHA: Yeah, I think you can fend for yourself.

3227
02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:11.130
TRAVIS: It's appreciated, but not necessary.

3228
02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:13.790
SAM: So you're in front then?

3229
02:31:15.630 --> 02:31:17.355
TRAVIS: Sure, I'm a member of this group,

3230
02:31:17.355 --> 02:31:18.736
I'll be in the front.

3231
02:31:18.736 --> 02:31:21.736
[cheering]

3232
02:31:23.438 --> 02:31:25.120
MATT: Who's in the front with Fjord?

3233
02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:27.970
LAURA: Me.
MARISHA: I'll be with Jester.

3234
02:31:27.970 --> 02:31:29.370
LAURA: Me and Beau.
MATT: All right.

3235
02:31:31.330 --> 02:31:36.319
Flanked by tougher ladies.
[cheering]

3236
02:31:36.319 --> 02:31:39.460
MARISHA: (sings battle prep music)
MATT: Who's behind them

3237
02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:40.340
and what order?

3238
02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:42.860
Is it just the same three and three or?

3239
02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:44.443
LIAM: Well, I will be second to last

3240
02:31:44.443 --> 02:31:47.009
and I will cast Mage Armor.

3241
02:31:47.009 --> 02:31:49.619
MATT: All righty, Mage Armor's up for eight hours, buddy.

3242
02:31:49.619 --> 02:31:51.950
TALIESIN: Yeah, maybe--
MATT: Who's at the back then?

3243
02:31:51.950 --> 02:31:54.850
Is it going to be Caduceus or?
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take the back,

3244
02:31:54.850 --> 02:31:56.770
and I'll keep an eye out for things.

3245
02:31:56.770 --> 02:31:57.603
MATT: All righty.

3246
02:31:57.603 --> 02:31:59.730
Put Nott and Caleb in the center

3247
02:31:59.730 --> 02:32:00.880
and then Caduceus at the back.

3248
02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:04.533
SAM: Nott Pocket!
MATT: Like a reverse flying V.

3249
02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:09.360
All right, so, continuing stealthily?

3250
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:13.130
MARISHA: What do we think, because, I mean.

3251
02:32:13.130 --> 02:32:14.180
LAURA: We should be stealthy.

3252
02:32:14.180 --> 02:32:16.680
MARISHA: Stealthy seemed to not do that much, though.

3253
02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:19.990
LAURA: Well, I'll cast Pass Without a Trace on us

3254
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:22.540
as much as I can.
MATT: How much can you cast it?

3255
02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:24.580
Because you have about, I'd say, a solid

3256
02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:26.760
eight to 10 hours of travel.

3257
02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:30.850
LAURA: I'll start out as soon as we're

3258
02:32:30.850 --> 02:32:32.880
down off the mountain, I'll cast it,

3259
02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:35.800
and then I'll cast, you know,

3260
02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:38.300
just cast it a few more times throughout the day.

3261
02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:39.550
So we'll have three hours

3262
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:42.800
of travel that will be stealthed, potentially.

3263
02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:44.850
MATT: So three out of eight to 10.
LAURA: Yeah.

3264
02:32:44.850 --> 02:32:45.683
MATT: You got it.

3265
02:32:45.683 --> 02:32:47.050
All right, so for the first couple hours

3266
02:32:47.050 --> 02:32:49.540
of journeying around the rest of the mountain base--

3267
02:32:49.540 --> 02:32:51.490
LAURA: I'll wait 'til dusk to cast it again.

3268
02:32:52.649 --> 02:32:53.549
MATT: Wait until dusk?

3269
02:32:54.760 --> 02:32:57.920
LAURA: Right, that's when scary things come out is dusk.

3270
02:32:57.920 --> 02:32:58.753
TALIESIN: I mean.

3271
02:32:58.753 --> 02:33:01.185
MATT: The fight you just had was during the day.

3272
02:33:01.185 --> 02:33:02.800
LAURA: Oh.

3273
02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:04.420
I will wait 'til around the same time

3274
02:33:04.420 --> 02:33:05.856
that the fight happened yesterday.

3275
02:33:05.856 --> 02:33:07.870
[laughter]
MATT: All right.

3276
02:33:07.870 --> 02:33:11.150
That'll put you about five hours into your journey.

3277
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:13.060
LAURA: Yeah, that's when I'll cast my third one.

3278
02:33:13.060 --> 02:33:14.460
MATT: Okay.

3279
02:33:14.460 --> 02:33:16.250
That's when you cast your third one, you said?

3280
02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:17.083
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: You're starting

3281
02:33:17.083 --> 02:33:18.740
for the first hour?
LAURA: Yes.

3282
02:33:18.740 --> 02:33:21.490
MATT: All right, everyone roll stealth with plus 10, please.

3283
02:33:22.488 --> 02:33:24.730
(laughs) Meteing this up into sections.

3284
02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:27.738
LAURA: Natural 20.
MATT: Nice.

3285
02:33:27.738 --> 02:33:29.200
[cheering]

3286
02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:30.600
SAM: 35.

3287
02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:32.490
TALIESIN: 27.
TRAVIS: 26.

3288
02:33:32.490 --> 02:33:34.436
MARISHA: 25.
LIAM: 23.

3289
02:33:34.436 --> 02:33:36.670
[cheering]

3290
02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:39.070
MATT: So first hour, you guys,

3291
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:42.160
like some trained, Navy SEAL shit,

3292
02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:44.070
make your way through the edge of the treeline

3293
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:46.310
around the mountainside, down into the next valley.

3294
02:33:46.310 --> 02:33:49.250
You can see the next large mountain pass ahead of you.

3295
02:33:49.250 --> 02:33:50.300
You start making your way in there.

3296
02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:51.670
Are you continuing for the second hour,

3297
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:53.140
to continue those rolls or do you want to?

3298
02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:54.280
LAURA: Yeah, let's keep with those rolls.

3299
02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:55.800
MATT: All right, so mark off another cast

3300
02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:57.110
of Pass Without a Trace.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

3301
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:59.490
MATT: You guys continue with that, unnoticed,

3302
02:33:59.490 --> 02:34:01.190
pushing through the valley floor now

3303
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:04.350
through the various thick elements of the pine forest

3304
02:34:04.350 --> 02:34:05.660
ahead of you in the center of the alps.

3305
02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:10.660
MARISHA: Any like disturbed dirt that looks like holes

3306
02:34:10.890 --> 02:34:14.300
that, like, a 12-foot worm could pop out of?

3307
02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:17.110
LAURA: Or melted snow, like--
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3308
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:19.413
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: Any signs, yeah.

3309
02:34:22.564 --> 02:34:24.630
(laughs) 12.

3310
02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:28.730
MATT: Not yet.

3311
02:34:28.730 --> 02:34:30.590
Third hour, are you continuing or are we?

3312
02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:31.900
LAURA: I'm going to wait--
MATT: You guys are now heading

3313
02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:34.210
into the center--
LAURA: I'm going to, oh.

3314
02:34:34.210 --> 02:34:35.870
MATT: You're now beyond the first mountain,

3315
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:37.980
you're now down into the valley that leads

3316
02:34:37.980 --> 02:34:40.450
into the secondary mountain.

3317
02:34:40.450 --> 02:34:41.610
LAURA: What do you guys think?

3318
02:34:41.610 --> 02:34:44.629
Should we keep Passing Without a Trace in this valley area?

3319
02:34:44.629 --> 02:34:46.270
SAM: It's been fine.

3320
02:34:46.270 --> 02:34:50.140
TALIESIN: I'll say, personally,
valleys kind of freak me out.

3321
02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:52.670
LAURA: We can keep it up for this next hour

3322
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:53.900
and then we'll be without it

3323
02:34:53.900 --> 02:34:56.450
for like seven hours potentially.

3324
02:34:56.450 --> 02:34:58.720
MATT: Okay, third hour continues.

3325
02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:00.080
You guys are now cresting into

3326
02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:02.200
the very center of the low point of the valley.

3327
02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:04.350
Hitting the base of the trough.

3328
02:35:04.350 --> 02:35:05.870
The trees are at their thickest.

3329
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:08.610
The forest floor is not as snow-covered

3330
02:35:08.610 --> 02:35:10.660
as a lot of it has been caught up in a canopy,

3331
02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:12.350
but it is a soft floor,

3332
02:35:12.350 --> 02:35:14.130
it is darker.
LAURA: I could use up my

3333
02:35:14.130 --> 02:35:17.591
3rd-level spell slots to keep casting it. Potentially.

3334
02:35:17.591 --> 02:35:18.666
MATT: You can use higher spell slots

3335
02:35:18.666 --> 02:35:19.920
to cast it again if you want to.

3336
02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:22.480
TALIESIN: Does it change when you use it at higher levels?

3337
02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:24.790
LAURA: No.
MATT: No, it just gets used again.

3338
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:25.739
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.

3339
02:35:25.739 --> 02:35:28.450
LAURA: What do you think?

3340
02:35:28.450 --> 02:35:30.108
No?
MARISHA: Eh.

3341
02:35:30.108 --> 02:35:30.941
LAURA: Okay, if you guys think we're--

3342
02:35:30.941 --> 02:35:34.040
MARISHA: Yesterday went great.

3343
02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:35.950
LAURA: We totally did, yeah.

3344
02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:37.490
MATT: So without?
SAM: Without.

3345
02:35:38.650 --> 02:35:41.069
MATT: I'm asking her, not you, Nott.

3346
02:35:41.069 --> 02:35:42.340
SAM: I'm drunk.

3347
02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:45.180
LAURA: I'm going to keep, I'm going to keep it up

3348
02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:47.550
while we're in this deep valley.

3349
02:35:47.550 --> 02:35:50.820
MATT: Okay, you've got, I'd say, two more hours of travel

3350
02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:52.530
before you hit the base of the next mountain,

3351
02:35:52.530 --> 02:35:54.500
so you can either expend two more slots or just one

3352
02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:56.250
and then roll again as you pass around the mountainside.

3353
02:35:56.250 --> 02:35:59.190
LAURA: I will use one more and then we'll roll again.

3354
02:35:59.190 --> 02:36:01.330
MATT: Okay, so, pushing now, you're about halfway

3355
02:36:01.330 --> 02:36:02.910
through the day's journey, just cresting past that,

3356
02:36:02.910 --> 02:36:06.000
you guys begin to hit the turn up of the rock formation

3357
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.230
to the base of the secondary mountain.

3358
02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:09.070
Which direction are you traveling?

3359
02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:09.940
LIAM: Right.

3360
02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:10.840
LAURA: Right, to the right.

3361
02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.490
MATT: You continue onto the right side,

3362
02:36:12.490 --> 02:36:13.380
curving around the mountain.

3363
02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:14.390
Everyone make a new stealth check

3364
02:36:14.390 --> 02:36:16.140
without the plus 10 bonus, please.

3365
02:36:18.010 --> 02:36:19.910
TALIESIN: Hey.

3366
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:20.743
MARISHA: Yeah.

3367
02:36:21.700 --> 02:36:23.560
LIAM: 17.
MARISHA: 24.

3368
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.147
TRAVIS: 21.
TALIESIN: Natural 20, 21.

3369
02:36:26.147 --> 02:36:27.460
[cheering]

3370
02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:29.950
LAURA: 18.
SAM: 23.

3371
02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:31.590
TRAVIS: Fucking shit!

3372
02:36:33.430 --> 02:36:35.950
MATT: As the clutching shadows of Jester's magic fade,

3373
02:36:35.950 --> 02:36:38.110
you all still keeping in step with Nott

3374
02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:40.260
and those of the party who are a little more

3375
02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:43.350
deft at avoiding being seen or causing a ruckus,

3376
02:36:43.350 --> 02:36:46.160
as a group, you still manage to make your way through

3377
02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:47.520
the final bit of the forest line,

3378
02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:50.560
up towards the second mountain, around its base,

3379
02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:52.360
and you continue on, do you want to continue

3380
02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:53.770
with that stealth roll?

3381
02:36:53.770 --> 02:36:56.390
You have one more roll for the last bit of the day

3382
02:36:56.390 --> 02:36:58.120
as you come around the edge

3383
02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:01.320
and begin to hit the next valley beyond.

3384
02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:02.770
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

3385
02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:04.440
I don't think I'm going to cast it anymore.

3386
02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:06.700
MATT: Okay, now, since--
LAURA: Right? Yeah.

3387
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:10.410
MATT: I need two people to make perceptions check for me.

3388
02:37:10.410 --> 02:37:11.410
Who's keeping an eye out?

3389
02:37:11.410 --> 02:37:13.690
All right, so both of you guys roll perception checks.

3390
02:37:19.535 --> 02:37:22.310
TRAVIS: Are those good movements?
SAM: Nope, they're not.

3391
02:37:22.310 --> 02:37:25.570
[laughter]

3392
02:37:25.570 --> 02:37:27.010
TALIESIN: 14.
SAM: Oh!

3393
02:37:27.010 --> 02:37:29.000
LAURA: Eight.
MATT: Okay.

3394
02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.470
You guys come around the second mountain

3395
02:37:30.470 --> 02:37:31.550
and looking out into the next valley,

3396
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:33.460
you can see three more mountains

3397
02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:35.660
and a little, like a smaller valley between.

3398
02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:40.420
You're not quite sure which direction to go towards,

3399
02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:41.470
which one of these mountains.

3400
02:37:41.470 --> 02:37:42.560
LAURA: Southwest, which way is southwest?

3401
02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:44.810
LIAM: Well, that way is north.

3402
02:37:44.810 --> 02:37:46.620
So southwest is that way.

3403
02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:47.990
LAURA: So we keep going southwest.

3404
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:50.720
MATT: Okay, following Caleb's lead.

3405
02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:52.580
Make one more stealth check as you guys push in

3406
02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:53.860
to this final valley.

3407
02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:57.053
TALIESIN: Hey!

3408
02:37:58.210 --> 02:38:00.460
LIAM: Not good.

3409
02:38:00.460 --> 02:38:02.080
MATT: Caleb?
LIAM: 11.

3410
02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.389
MARISHA: 24.
TRAVIS: Four.

3411
02:38:05.650 --> 02:38:07.540
TALIESIN: 18.
LAURA: 13.

3412
02:38:07.540 --> 02:38:08.950
SAM: 20.

3413
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:09.783
MATT: All righty.

3414
02:38:13.066 --> 02:38:14.330
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't, come on--

3415
02:38:16.983 --> 02:38:19.247
LIAM: Tarrasque.
LAURA: No!

3416
02:38:19.247 --> 02:38:21.360
[laughter]

3417
02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:22.580
TALIESIN: Should I mention that we are

3418
02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:25.680
walking without rhythm.

3419
02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:27.790
Does that help, does that?

3420
02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:28.960
MATT: Wrong universe.

3421
02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:33.110
TALIESIN: Damn it. Worth a try.

3422
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:35.410
MATT: So as you crest through the base

3423
02:38:35.410 --> 02:38:37.840
of this final valley heading in a southwest direction

3424
02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:40.590
that you believe Caleb is properly sending you towards,

3425
02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:45.380
not as quiet as you had hoped.

3426
02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:47.740
However, you do manage to come upon

3427
02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:52.520
the outskirts of a campground.

3428
02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:54.650
You can see a little bit of smoke.

3429
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:57.070
Not black, but almost like a white-gray.

3430
02:38:57.070 --> 02:38:59.790
It's been burning for a while

3431
02:38:59.790 --> 02:39:02.500
and it's towards the end of its cycle as a fire.

3432
02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:06.950
MARISHA: Any sign of what kind of camp?

3433
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:10.040
Like trolls.
SAM: Summer camp?

3434
02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:11.490
MARISHA: Summer camp, space camp?

3435
02:39:14.859 --> 02:39:16.415
MATT: It's not a space camp.

3436
02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:21.790
You do come upon

3437
02:39:21.790 --> 02:39:24.790
a cluster of stones set around a fire

3438
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:27.400
but it's now embers left.

3439
02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.520
The snow around it has melted for the most part

3440
02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:32.420
with elements of slush and ice that have just

3441
02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:34.810
slightly gathered around the outskirts of it.

3442
02:39:34.810 --> 02:39:38.320
You can see a bit of the underbrush poking through.

3443
02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:39.980
You can see elements of the floor around it

3444
02:39:39.980 --> 02:39:41.880
has been mussed and shifted like there were

3445
02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:44.900
bed rolls and other things set up in that space

3446
02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:47.860
but have since vacated.
LAURA: What about footprints?

3447
02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:50.913
Do we see any footprints?
MATT: Make a survival check.

3448
02:39:52.106 --> 02:39:53.670
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Survival.

3449
02:39:53.670 --> 02:39:57.560
TRAVIS: And vacated, no tents, no nothing like that?

3450
02:39:57.560 --> 02:39:59.720
LAURA: 15.
MATT: 15?

3451
02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:03.970
You do see some elements of the brush

3452
02:40:03.970 --> 02:40:05.320
that's been pushed down through weight

3453
02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:07.410
in a rhythmic pattern in multiple places

3454
02:40:07.410 --> 02:40:09.770
and they all lead loosely in the direction you're traveling.

3455
02:40:09.770 --> 02:40:12.204
LIAM: You said there was a circle of stones for a fire?

3456
02:40:12.204 --> 02:40:13.570
MATT: Mm-hm.
LIAM: Could I make

3457
02:40:13.570 --> 02:40:15.670
an approximation of how long it's been

3458
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:17.480
since the fire went out?

3459
02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:19.210
MATT: Sure, make a survival check.
LIAM: Okay.

3460
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:23.063
16.

3461
02:40:24.010 --> 02:40:25.493
MATT: It looks like the fire was meant to

3462
02:40:25.493 --> 02:40:26.870
burn through the night

3463
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:30.560
and it is down to its embers and had been probably in embers

3464
02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:32.410
for the past three to four hours.

3465
02:40:32.410 --> 02:40:34.620
The fire, you're not sure when the people left,

3466
02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:35.980
but the fire itself has not been

3467
02:40:35.980 --> 02:40:38.060
a useful fire for that long.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

3468
02:40:39.290 --> 02:40:41.390
SAM: You said the footsteps are going in the direction

3469
02:40:41.390 --> 02:40:43.170
loosely that we're traveling?
MATT: Correct.

3470
02:40:43.170 --> 02:40:45.360
MARISHA: Do the footsteps appear large

3471
02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:46.920
or we're too far away to know?

3472
02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:48.700
MATT: They look medium-sized creature.

3473
02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:51.020
TRAVIS: Can we scan the horizon,

3474
02:40:51.020 --> 02:40:54.790
see if we see any creatures in the distance or looking?

3475
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:57.970
MATT: You are in the center of the heavy forest right now,

3476
02:40:57.970 --> 02:41:00.120
so there's no horizon to look at.

3477
02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:01.610
There are treetops, tree trunks,

3478
02:41:01.610 --> 02:41:02.820
and a little bit of the sky above you,

3479
02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:05.180
you can see past the canopy, that's barely visible,

3480
02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:06.200
other than directly above you.

3481
02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:07.620
LAURA: Can you climb a tree?

3482
02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:09.570
SAM: Beau, I'll race you to the top of a tree.

3483
02:41:09.570 --> 02:41:11.780
MARISHA: Deal, I go.
SAM: I'm going too!

3484
02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:14.130
MARISHA: Instantly.
SAM: I'm instantly going.

3485
02:41:14.130 --> 02:41:15.649
MATT: Acrobatics checks for both of you.

3486
02:41:15.649 --> 02:41:19.420
[laughter]

3487
02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:20.600
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3488
02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:22.110
SAM: 26.

3489
02:41:24.500 --> 02:41:27.460
MARISHA: 25.
(exclamations)

3490
02:41:29.590 --> 02:41:32.156
SAM: I'm going to do some parkour shit.

3491
02:41:32.156 --> 02:41:35.190
MARISHA: I take my staff

3492
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:38.080
and I jam it under Nott and I try and trip her off the tree.

3493
02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:39.180
MATT: Make an attack roll.

3494
02:41:41.390 --> 02:41:43.240
MARISHA: Sorry.

3495
02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:44.073
TRAVIS: Not sorry.

3496
02:41:44.073 --> 02:41:45.740
LIAM: I thought I was the catty one.

3497
02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:48.570
MARISHA: 23.
SAM: Hits.

3498
02:41:48.570 --> 02:41:51.073
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

3499
02:41:51.073 --> 02:41:51.906
MARISHA: With my staff, right?

3500
02:41:51.906 --> 02:41:54.093
MATT: Well, if you're just trying to trip her up, go ahead--

3501
02:41:54.093 --> 02:41:54.950
MARISHA: Just trip.
MATT: Go ahead and make

3502
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:57.740
contested strength checks.

3503
02:41:59.021 --> 02:42:00.980
SAM: Oh, no, nope, nope.
MATT: This is a shove maneuver.

3504
02:42:00.980 --> 02:42:02.730
SAM: Two.
MARISHA: 14.

3505
02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:05.130
MATT: As you're getting up to the top

3506
02:42:05.130 --> 02:42:06.420
and you're getting ahead of Beauregard,

3507
02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:09.170
you just (whooshes), leaping up these trees,

3508
02:42:09.170 --> 02:42:11.990
suddenly, there's a crack, a flash of white

3509
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:13.940
as a staff hits you right in the shoulder.

3510
02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:16.956
And your fingers lose the grip on the tree.

3511
02:42:16.956 --> 02:42:18.014
MARISHA: Ha ha!

3512
02:42:18.014 --> 02:42:19.853
[laughter]

3513
02:42:19.853 --> 02:42:21.540
LAURA: (laughs)
MARISHA: Beau makes it to the top.

3514
02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:23.390
Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw for me, please.

3515
02:42:23.390 --> 02:42:24.340
SAM: Am I falling?

3516
02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:26.220
MATT: You are about to be falling.

3517
02:42:26.220 --> 02:42:28.678
SAM: Unless I?

3518
02:42:28.678 --> 02:42:30.640
A dexterity save or a check?

3519
02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:31.715
MATT: Saving throw.

3520
02:42:31.715 --> 02:42:32.548
SAM: 14.
MATT: 14 (whooshes),

3521
02:42:32.548 --> 02:42:33.770
you catch a branch but Beau

3522
02:42:33.770 --> 02:42:36.503
has gained a 10-foot lead on you.

3523
02:42:36.503 --> 02:42:39.610
SAM: Mage Hand! Pulling her hair.

3524
02:42:39.610 --> 02:42:44.593
[cheering]

3525
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:50.440
MATT: Make a contested strength versus your--

3526
02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:54.390
d20 plus your ability modifier for your spell casting.

3527
02:42:54.390 --> 02:42:55.700
MARISHA: Wait.

3528
02:42:55.700 --> 02:42:57.210
MATT: Should be your intelligence.
MARISHA: What do I roll?

3529
02:42:57.210 --> 02:42:58.310
Strength?
MATT: Strength.

3530
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:03.820
SAM: Not great, 14.

3531
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:07.260
MARISHA: 19.
SAM: (groans)

3532
02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:09.280
MATT: The Mage Hand tugs back at her hair

3533
02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:11.790
and it comes off of the usual set bun.

3534
02:43:11.790 --> 02:43:14.090
MARISHA: Ow, ow, ow!
MATT: She pulls out of it,

3535
02:43:14.090 --> 02:43:16.020
a few hairs pull out of the roots

3536
02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:17.780
and are now left in the somewhat spectral hand

3537
02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:20.640
floating in space, but you both continue keeping up.

3538
02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:23.420
MARISHA: I reach in my bag and I pull out a firecracker

3539
02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:24.889
and I light it and I throw it behind me.

3540
02:43:24.889 --> 02:43:28.800
LAURA: No! You're attracting people!

3541
02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:31.220
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: It's just a firecracker.

3542
02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:32.550
MATT: Lighting a firecracker,

3543
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:33.860
it isn't like a pull out and throw,

3544
02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:37.147
you got to pull out (ticking), (sizzling).

3545
02:43:37.147 --> 02:43:38.072
It's not a very fast maneuver.

3546
02:43:38.072 --> 02:43:39.030
MARISHA: Fuck that, too much time.

3547
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:42.500
I just throw the firecracker and hope I hit her in the face.

3548
02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:44.621
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

3549
02:43:44.621 --> 02:43:48.590
Roll an attack with your dex bonus,

3550
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:50.350
no proficiency modifier because you're not proficient

3551
02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:52.910
in throwing a firecracker.

3552
02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:56.030
MARISHA: Natural 20.
(laughter)

3553
02:44:00.518 --> 02:44:01.988
MATT: This is the dumbest shit!

3554
02:44:01.988 --> 02:44:02.821
SAM: Oh my god.

3555
02:44:03.790 --> 02:44:04.623
TALIESIN: Of course now.

3556
02:44:05.779 --> 02:44:07.570
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
MATT: All right.

3557
02:44:07.570 --> 02:44:09.546
You take a firecracker to the face.

3558
02:44:09.546 --> 02:44:11.390
[laughter]

3559
02:44:11.390 --> 02:44:12.610
You've certainly lost your lead.

3560
02:44:12.610 --> 02:44:15.420
You guys are now neck and neck between two bits.

3561
02:44:15.420 --> 02:44:16.970
I'd say you guys, both together,

3562
02:44:16.970 --> 02:44:18.700
have one more push up this tree.

3563
02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:20.943
SAM: I'm going to shoot her with my gun.

3564
02:44:20.943 --> 02:44:25.060
[cheering]
MATT: Okay.

3565
02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:27.130
Make an attack rolL.
MARISHA: Step of the Wind!

3566
02:44:30.150 --> 02:44:32.690
SAM: Attack is 21 to hit.

3567
02:44:34.009 --> 02:44:35.861
(gun cocking)
(booming)

3568
02:44:35.861 --> 02:44:37.410
MARISHA: Hit, you bitch.

3569
02:44:37.410 --> 02:44:38.900
MATT: All right, roll damage.

3570
02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:40.914
SAM: I'm aiming for her ass.

3571
02:44:40.914 --> 02:44:43.070
[laughter]

3572
02:44:43.070 --> 02:44:43.903
MATT: Roll damage.

3573
02:44:43.903 --> 02:44:45.720
SAM: I am shooting her with a gun.

3574
02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:49.500
MATT: This isn't with your crossbow?

3575
02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:54.290
SAM: No, with my gun!
[laughter]

3576
02:44:57.900 --> 02:45:00.390
MARISHA: The one you have one shot for?

3577
02:45:00.390 --> 02:45:03.479
SAM: It's worth it!
[laughter]

3578
02:45:03.479 --> 02:45:08.427
[cheering]

3579
02:45:08.427 --> 02:45:12.635
[cheering]

3580
02:45:12.635 --> 02:45:16.290
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

3581
02:45:16.290 --> 02:45:18.760
LIAM: This is what Percy has wrought.

3582
02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:20.750
[laughter]

3583
02:45:20.750 --> 02:45:22.310
SAM: Oh, roll damage?
MATT: Yeah.

3584
02:45:22.310 --> 02:45:25.197
SAM: Okay, where's my d10?

3585
02:45:25.197 --> 02:45:28.500
MATT: d10 plus dex modifier.

3586
02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:31.470
SAM: Ooh, 14!

3587
02:45:31.470 --> 02:45:32.590
MATT: 14.

3588
02:45:33.599 --> 02:45:35.920
MARISHA: (yells)

3589
02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:37.560
MATT: Okay.

3590
02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:38.960
SAM: That slow her down at all?

3591
02:45:40.078 --> 02:45:40.911
LAURA: She's got a bullet in her ass.

3592
02:45:40.911 --> 02:45:42.860
MATT: Yeah, okay, so she takes it, if she wants to

3593
02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:45.240
and continues onward.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3594
02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:48.870
LAURA: Musket ball.
MATT: Right in the ass.

3595
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:52.040
Not expecting, you hear the explosion sound

3596
02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:54.770
of the gun firing and a sharp pain in your butt.

3597
02:45:54.770 --> 02:45:56.330
Shit, probably should have deflected that.

3598
02:45:56.330 --> 02:45:58.090
LAURA: I immediately start scanning the--

3599
02:45:58.090 --> 02:46:01.020
MATT: Oh, that's right, I forgot I could catch bullets.

3600
02:46:01.020 --> 02:46:03.845
But it was in my ass!
MATT: I know.

3601
02:46:03.845 --> 02:46:05.060
TRAVIS: Shot me in the ass!

3602
02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:06.070
MARISHA: Shot me in the ass.
MATT: And you learned,

3603
02:46:06.070 --> 02:46:07.390
you learned a valuable lesson.

3604
02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:09.430
LIAM: You kind of did catch it.
TALIESIN: Clench, yeah.

3605
02:46:09.430 --> 02:46:11.790
MATT: You did, that's true.

3606
02:46:11.790 --> 02:46:14.880
SAM: Hot Pocket!
(laughter)

3607
02:46:20.340 --> 02:46:25.020
MATT: So the downside is you did get shot in the ass.

3608
02:46:25.020 --> 02:46:27.710
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: And took 14 points of piercing damage.

3609
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:28.910
The bonus is with Step of the Wind,

3610
02:46:28.910 --> 02:46:31.337
you make it to the top first.
SAM: Darn!

3611
02:46:31.337 --> 02:46:34.004
MARISHA: (yells)

3612
02:46:37.208 --> 02:46:41.510
I have a lot of blood running down my leg, but fuck you.

3613
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:43.720
I win.
SAM: It was a fair race.

3614
02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:46.400
MARISHA: It was a fair race.

3615
02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:48.260
I shake Nott's hand.
MATT: All right.

3616
02:46:49.501 --> 02:46:53.530
MARISHA: And then I let her go.
SAM: (yells)

3617
02:46:53.530 --> 02:46:56.240
MATT: Just flings you off down the treetop.

3618
02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:59.120
SAM: I'll Feather Fall.

3619
02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:02.193
MATT: As she slowly pummels, bouncing off,

3620
02:47:02.193 --> 02:47:04.660
make a perception check from above the treeline.

3621
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:07.960
MARISHA: Oh god, I hope I don't fuck <i>this</i> up.

3622
02:47:08.930 --> 02:47:11.840
None of it was worth it, ooh.
LIAM: Holy shit.

3623
02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:14.410
MARISHA: Oh, okay, nine.

3624
02:47:15.348 --> 02:47:16.848
AUDIENCE: Nein!

3625
02:47:19.100 --> 02:47:21.100
MATT: The searing pain in your bottom

3626
02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:22.760
is a little distracting.

3627
02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:23.593
LAURA: In your bottom!

3628
02:47:23.593 --> 02:47:26.720
MATT: You make out a couple of shapes at the base of

3629
02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:29.710
the mountain, central to where you guys are facing,

3630
02:47:29.710 --> 02:47:32.120
but you can't make out more detail than that.

3631
02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:34.270
It's something.
MARISHA: At the base of the mountain?

3632
02:47:34.270 --> 02:47:35.590
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: Okay.

3633
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:37.240
MATT: Like just above the treeline.

3634
02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:39.643
MARISHA: Don't look at me like that.

3635
02:47:39.643 --> 02:47:41.243
SAM: Hmph!

3636
02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:46.360
MATT: You guys all gather again at the base of the forest,

3637
02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:49.120
Beauregard conveys the inkling of information

3638
02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:51.560
that she gleaned at the top of the tree.

3639
02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:53.870
LAURA: Are we scanning amongst the trees,

3640
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:57.040
seeing if anything was attracted by that giant ruckus?

3641
02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:58.500
MATT: You mean the extremely loud gunshot

3642
02:47:58.500 --> 02:47:59.690
that echoed through the entire forest?

3643
02:47:59.690 --> 02:48:01.702
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm paying attention.
SAM: Sorry.

3644
02:48:01.702 --> 02:48:02.970
MATT: Yeah, roll a perception check, both of you.

3645
02:48:02.970 --> 02:48:04.672
SAM: Sorry about that.

3646
02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:06.703
TALIESIN: Oh, for--!

3647
02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:09.433
12.

3648
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:12.380
LAURA: 14.

3649
02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:13.890
MATT: 14, okay.

3650
02:48:13.890 --> 02:48:18.888
You guys don't notice anything... yet.

3651
02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:21.500
TALIESIN: We should--
SAM: Maybe we should

3652
02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:23.320
just keep going fast.

3653
02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:24.650
Maybe we should just keep going.

3654
02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:26.150
MATT: Are you going full pace or are you going stealth--

3655
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:27.020
SAM: Full pace, full pace.

3656
02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:29.040
TALIESIN: Also, I wanted to, before we leave,

3657
02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:30.590
I want to cast Detect Magic

3658
02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:33.190
while we were at the little campsite.

3659
02:48:33.190 --> 02:48:34.236
MATT: Okay.

3660
02:48:34.236 --> 02:48:35.069
You cast Detect Magic

3661
02:48:35.069 --> 02:48:37.500
as they're having this brief discussion.

3662
02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:38.890
TALIESIN: While they were running.
MATT: Right.

3663
02:48:38.890 --> 02:48:40.220
Nothing catches your attention in this space.

3664
02:48:40.220 --> 02:48:42.080
TALIESIN: Cool, all right.

3665
02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:43.713
SAM: Let's just go.

3666
02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.450
Our race caused a bit of a ruckus, Beau and I.

3667
02:48:49.450 --> 02:48:50.470
TALIESIN: Really?
MARISHA: Yes.

3668
02:48:50.470 --> 02:48:52.540
SAM: So we should probably just hurry as fast as we can.

3669
02:48:52.540 --> 02:48:54.970
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll just--
LAURA: So we run

3670
02:48:54.970 --> 02:48:56.610
the last bit of the day?

3671
02:48:56.610 --> 02:48:57.680
TRAVIS: Sure.

3672
02:48:57.680 --> 02:48:58.990
MARISHA and SAM: Sorry.

3673
02:48:58.990 --> 02:49:00.070
MARISHA: It was, sorry.

3674
02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:01.330
MATT: All right, for the last few hours,

3675
02:49:01.330 --> 02:49:05.230
you guys continue pushing on, unstealthily, at a full run.

3676
02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:08.350
As the light begins to darken in the sky,

3677
02:49:08.350 --> 02:49:11.610
the elements of dusk beginning to slowly settle in,

3678
02:49:11.610 --> 02:49:12.943
you hear it.

3679
02:49:12.943 --> 02:49:17.801
(wolf howling)

3680
02:49:19.568 --> 02:49:23.860
[howling]

3681
02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:25.531
LAURA: That's a lot of wolves, you guys.

3682
02:49:25.531 --> 02:49:28.238
[laughter]
SAM: 2,000 wolves!

3683
02:49:28.238 --> 02:49:29.570
MATT: That's a lot of fucking wolves.

3684
02:49:31.245 --> 02:49:33.685
They're getting louder and closer.

3685
02:49:33.685 --> 02:49:35.197
TALIESIN: From behind us or?

3686
02:49:35.197 --> 02:49:37.250
MATT: From behind and around you.

3687
02:49:37.250 --> 02:49:39.175
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Thaumaturgy

3688
02:49:39.175 --> 02:49:40.583
to start a big earthquake

3689
02:49:40.583 --> 02:49:42.420
behind us and start trying to scatter

3690
02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:43.253
wherever I hear wolves.

3691
02:49:43.253 --> 02:49:45.080
MATT: Okay, you make a mild rumbling sound,

3692
02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:46.480
as it is a cantrip.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3693
02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:49.330
I mean, it's about a thing to shake earth, so.

3694
02:49:49.330 --> 02:49:50.930
MATT: It does, it shakes the earth a little bit.

3695
02:49:50.930 --> 02:49:52.980
Like under a person, sure.

3696
02:49:52.980 --> 02:49:54.440
You fake some worms.
TALIESIN: Fake some worms.

3697
02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:57.730
MATT: Anybody else doing anything as you guys are running?

3698
02:49:57.730 --> 02:49:59.880
All right, you guys are running.

3699
02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:01.840
As you're heading towards the edge of the treeline,

3700
02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:03.240
you can hear the howls getting louder

3701
02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:04.950
and they're communicating and they're circulating

3702
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:06.600
and they're starting to pincer around.

3703
02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:08.900
[howling]

3704
02:50:08.900 --> 02:50:12.290
As you rush up through the edge of the treeline,

3705
02:50:12.290 --> 02:50:13.520
you can see now, ahead of you,

3706
02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:17.360
a dozen or so stone towers

3707
02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:19.490
rising out of the snowy mountainside

3708
02:50:19.490 --> 02:50:21.720
about 300 or 400 feet above.

3709
02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:23.520
This is what you had barely noticed,

3710
02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:26.720
this time without bird poop in your eye.

3711
02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:31.560
You can see, it's got a cross about a mile or so

3712
02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:33.680
at the base of this large crag.

3713
02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:36.230
You can see four of them appear to be

3714
02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:37.900
centered around a specific smaller structure

3715
02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:40.910
that's barely visible among the ice and rock

3716
02:50:40.910 --> 02:50:44.450
and at the edge, you can see about

3717
02:50:44.450 --> 02:50:48.558
eight or nine heavy, fur-cloaked

3718
02:50:48.558 --> 02:50:51.591
figures standing there.

3719
02:50:51.591 --> 02:50:54.141
SAM: Guards of some sort?

3720
02:50:54.141 --> 02:50:55.690
MATT: What are you guys doing?

3721
02:50:55.690 --> 02:50:57.610
LIAM: Well, the wolves are still howling behind us, yeah?

3722
02:50:57.610 --> 02:50:59.753
MATT: Yeah, and they're getting louder and louder.

3723
02:50:59.753 --> 02:51:02.610
[howling]

3724
02:51:02.610 --> 02:51:04.310
LIAM: Guys, it's okay.

3725
02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:08.910
Caleb is a werewolf.
[laughter]

3726
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:13.306
LAURA: Should we put our hands up

3727
02:51:13.306 --> 02:51:16.160
as we're running towards them?

3728
02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:18.330
TRAVIS: They're from this area, they know their wolves here.

3729
02:51:18.330 --> 02:51:20.220
We should keep moving.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3730
02:51:20.220 --> 02:51:23.370
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, but it'll let us know that we're friendly

3731
02:51:23.370 --> 02:51:25.730
as we run towards them with our hands up.

3732
02:51:25.730 --> 02:51:28.560
TALIESIN: How humanoid do these things in cloaks look?

3733
02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:30.260
MATT: Make a perception check.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3734
02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:32.520
I'm going to try the bee die again.

3735
02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:35.250
Ooh, that's okay, 25.

3736
02:51:35.250 --> 02:51:36.889
MATT: 25.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3737
02:51:36.889 --> 02:51:41.889
MATT: A lot of them look squat and sturdy, dwarven

3738
02:51:42.110 --> 02:51:45.850
in exterior form, some of them appear to be taller,

3739
02:51:45.850 --> 02:51:47.693
a little more lithe, you see a combination of

3740
02:51:47.693 --> 02:51:50.710
dwarf, elf, and other humanoids amongst these

3741
02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:52.120
and beyond the eight that are facing you,

3742
02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:54.350
there's others in the towers and in the vicinity.

3743
02:51:54.350 --> 02:51:57.510
TALIESIN: I'm going to call up to them then,

3744
02:51:57.510 --> 02:52:01.850
projecting my voice: Travelers requesting sanctuary,

3745
02:52:01.850 --> 02:52:03.450
we've got a wolf problem.

3746
02:52:03.450 --> 02:52:05.490
MATT: You doing the same, Jester?
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

3747
02:52:05.490 --> 02:52:07.840
MATT: Both of you guys make persuasion checks, please.

3748
02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:08.673
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

3749
02:52:08.673 --> 02:52:10.480
SAM: All of us or just--
LAURA: No, just me and--

3750
02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:11.980
MATT: Just the two of them, since they are the ones

3751
02:52:11.980 --> 02:52:14.270
raising their voices initially.

3752
02:52:14.270 --> 02:52:15.103
LAURA: Why?

3753
02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:20.320
TALIESIN: 22.
MATT: 22.

3754
02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:23.579
And you rolled a natural?

3755
02:52:23.579 --> 02:52:28.579
LAURA: No, no, no. I rolled an eight.
MATT: Okay, okay.

3756
02:52:28.890 --> 02:52:31.290
So as Jester starts shouting initially,

3757
02:52:31.290 --> 02:52:33.520
you see a bunch of them raising their crossbows,

3758
02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:35.440
their longbows, and mounting it.

3759
02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:36.880
Caduceus puts up his hands,

3760
02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:39.020
using Thaumaturgy to project the warning--

3761
02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:41.940
LAURA: I'm just yelling help, help, help, help, help, help!

3762
02:52:41.940 --> 02:52:43.220
TALIESIN: We've just got a wolf problem

3763
02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:45.870
and we're requesting sanctuary, hello?

3764
02:52:45.870 --> 02:52:49.320
MATT: You watch as all eight of them (booms)

3765
02:52:49.320 --> 02:52:51.760
fire (whooshes), release their arrows in your direction.

3766
02:52:52.789 --> 02:52:54.760
(whooshes) Whizz past you and you can see as a

3767
02:52:54.760 --> 02:52:57.139
group of wolves begin to emerge from the treeline

3768
02:52:57.139 --> 02:52:59.810
(whimpering) some of them get knocked back.

3769
02:52:59.810 --> 02:53:00.740
They go ahead and reload again

3770
02:53:00.740 --> 02:53:02.244
as you guys begin to approach.

3771
02:53:02.244 --> 02:53:03.560
(whooshes) A second volley and you can see

3772
02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:05.090
about a dozen or so of these large wolves,

3773
02:53:05.090 --> 02:53:06.440
similar to the ones that you guys had encountered

3774
02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:10.190
in the first battle, charging, and a few more get hit.

3775
02:53:10.190 --> 02:53:13.470
Eventually, they begin to split off and recoil back

3776
02:53:13.470 --> 02:53:15.920
towards the comfort of the forest.

3777
02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:18.560
TALIESIN: Either they're friendly or they have terrible aim.

3778
02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:19.839
Either way, we're pretty good.

3779
02:53:19.839 --> 02:53:22.550
(laughter)
MATT: Yeah.

3780
02:53:24.290 --> 02:53:26.200
As you guys rush up to meet them,

3781
02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:29.550
you can see, they're all pretty haggard,

3782
02:53:30.620 --> 02:53:32.860
definitely the type of dwarves and elves

3783
02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:34.680
that spend most of their day out here

3784
02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:38.330
patrolling the outside of a very tough,

3785
02:53:38.330 --> 02:53:40.660
snowy, icy mountain range.

3786
02:53:40.660 --> 02:53:42.430
They all give you a grimace

3787
02:53:42.430 --> 02:53:44.890
and an acknowledgement nod, but definitely

3788
02:53:44.890 --> 02:53:47.410
glaring at the eyes of, all right, outsiders,

3789
02:53:47.410 --> 02:53:50.270
we left you alive, you know?

3790
02:53:50.270 --> 02:53:52.090
So as you guys approach and slow down,

3791
02:53:52.090 --> 02:53:53.250
feeling a little more comfortable

3792
02:53:53.250 --> 02:53:57.625
in the space where they stand, what would you like to do?

3793
02:53:59.303 --> 02:54:00.703
LAURA: Well, hi.

3794
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:03.760
MATT: One of them steps up, you can see,

3795
02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:05.620
he pulls his hood back a bit.

3796
02:54:05.620 --> 02:54:08.930
This is a male dwarf, you see long, tangled, black hair,

3797
02:54:08.930 --> 02:54:11.590
big bushy beard that just (poofs) at the front of his face.

3798
02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:13.730
You can't even really see his mouth.

3799
02:54:13.730 --> 02:54:15.290
The mustache and beard merges,

3800
02:54:15.290 --> 02:54:16.710
so he just talks, you can see it move

3801
02:54:16.710 --> 02:54:18.850
and a voice emerges from somewhere within.

3802
02:54:18.850 --> 02:54:20.250
[laughter]

3803
02:54:20.250 --> 02:54:21.083
He just goes.

3804
02:54:22.170 --> 02:54:23.003
"Hail!

3805
02:54:24.250 --> 02:54:27.643
"So, travelers, what--

3806
02:54:27.643 --> 02:54:30.170

02:54:30.170 --> 02:54:32.212

3808
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:38.370

TALIESIN: Yeah.

3809
02:54:38.370 --> 02:54:41.384
We were hoping, we're looking for someone?

3810
02:54:41.384 --> 02:54:44.110
LAURA: Dulgrim Smeltborne.

3811
02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:45.890
MATT: "You're looking for a Smeltborne?"

3812
02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:50.330
LAURA: Aye.
[laughter]

3813
02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:53.120
MATT: "Let me look at you,"

3814
02:54:54.226 --> 02:54:56.100
and he walks over and begins, one by one,

3815
02:54:56.100 --> 02:54:56.933
inspecting each of you.

3816
02:54:56.933 --> 02:54:58.250
He goes up to Fjord and grabs the armor

3817
02:54:58.250 --> 02:54:59.810
and suits you up and looks at your face

3818
02:54:59.810 --> 02:55:02.396
from side to side.
SAM: He's harmless.

3819

3822

3823
02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:15.600
MATT: Looks past Caleb and Nott.

3824
02:55:17.067 --> 02:55:18.880
Looks at you, kind of like.

3825
02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:20.605
SAM: (teeth baring) Ah.

3826
02:55:22.310 --> 02:55:24.420
MATT: "You come with a goblin?"

3827
02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:29.370
LAURA: She's a really, really sweet goblin, mostly drunk.

3828
02:55:30.719 --> 02:55:33.450
SAM: Do you want a drink?

3829
02:55:33.450 --> 02:55:35.850
I'll offer my flask.

3830
02:55:35.850 --> 02:55:40.319
MATT: "I like this goblin."

3831
02:55:40.319 --> 02:55:41.319
TALIESIN: Well done.

3832
02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:47.380

3839
02:56:08.910 --> 02:56:10.070
TALIESIN: Glassplate, Glassblade?

3840
02:56:10.070 --> 02:56:11.620
MATT: Glassblade.

3841
02:56:13.748 --> 02:56:17.070
MARISHA: That's a cool name, by the way, Glassblade.

3842
02:56:17.070 --> 02:56:18.047
LAURA: Glassblade!

3843
02:56:18.047 --> 02:56:21.288
MATT: "It's more of a title than a name, but thank you."

3844
02:56:21.288 --> 02:56:23.720
LAURA: Aren't you looking for glass or something?

3845
02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:27.111
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, not really.

3846
02:56:27.111 --> 02:56:29.400
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I was getting at.

3847
02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:30.233
LAURA: Wait a minute.

3848
02:56:30.233 --> 02:56:31.330
TALIESIN: I feel like you're reaching again.

3849
02:56:31.330 --> 02:56:35.029
LAURA: Can I look at the guy and be like: Is it green?

3850
02:56:35.029 --> 02:56:36.922
LIAM: What responsibilities does the title come with--

3851
02:56:36.922 --> 02:56:38.425
MATT: "We don't actually fight with glass.

3852
02:56:38.425 --> 02:56:40.290
"It's just a name."

3853
02:56:40.290 --> 02:56:42.370
LAURA: Where did it come from, though, do you know?

3854
02:56:42.370 --> 02:56:45.793
MATT: "I don't know, I'm not historian."

3855
02:56:46.973 --> 02:56:47.806
LAURA: Okay.

3856
02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:53.039
MATT: "You think I'd be out here if I was in the books?"

3857
02:56:53.039 --> 02:56:53.872
LAURA: No?

3858
02:56:53.872 --> 02:56:56.400
MATT: "Good, get inside."

3859
02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:58.650
Puts his hood back up, takes out a piece of jerky,

3860
02:56:58.650 --> 02:56:59.770
and rips it in his teeth,

3861
02:56:59.770 --> 02:57:01.670
and goes to walk back to his patrol.

3862
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:03.390
The other ones are watching you,

3863
02:57:03.390 --> 02:57:06.690
their hands on the sides of their various weapons,

3864
02:57:06.690 --> 02:57:08.164
shrug their shoulders away and they go about,

3865
02:57:08.164 --> 02:57:10.190
scattering amongst the perimeter,

3866
02:57:10.190 --> 02:57:13.510
keeping an eye in case the wolves try and circle back.

3867
02:57:13.510 --> 02:57:16.530
MARISHA: For the people who are out here who read books,

3868
02:57:16.530 --> 02:57:18.890
do I know what a Glassblade is?

3869
02:57:18.890 --> 02:57:20.040
MATT: Make a history check.

3870
02:57:23.050 --> 02:57:24.692
MARISHA: Oh, <i>ja</i>.

3871
02:57:24.692 --> 02:57:28.360
25.
MATT: Okay.

3872
02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:29.810
What little bit you've heard of Uthodurn,

3873
02:57:29.810 --> 02:57:31.700
the Glassblades, you understand as being

3874
02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:35.641
the title of their essential military

3875
02:57:35.641 --> 02:57:40.133
and ranger force that guards, hunts, and just looks over

3876
02:57:40.133 --> 02:57:43.880
the perimeter of Uthodurn.

3877
02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:45.460
You're not entirely certain

3878
02:57:45.460 --> 02:57:46.880
what the source of the name was,

3879
02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:49.450
but it's been the title of their military

3880
02:57:49.450 --> 02:57:50.620
since Uthodurn was first founded,

3881
02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:52.610
which was shortly after the Calamity.

3882
02:57:52.610 --> 02:57:54.000
This place, you do know, however,

3883
02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:58.778
has existed probably for between 600 to 800 years.

3884
02:57:58.778 --> 02:57:59.650
With that history check,

3885
02:57:59.650 --> 02:58:03.000
you know the elves are a comparatively recent addition.

3886
02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.570
Initially, a pure dwarven society,

3887
02:58:04.570 --> 02:58:07.660
the elves came after the destruction of Molaesmyr

3888
02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:10.290
and the corruption of what is now known as the Savalirwood.

3889
02:58:10.290 --> 02:58:12.380
They were essentially refugees

3890
02:58:12.380 --> 02:58:14.480
and the dwarves allowed them sanctuary

3891
02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:17.870
and have since created a dual society

3892
02:58:17.870 --> 02:58:20.010
known as the Diarchy of Uthodurn.

3893
02:58:20.010 --> 02:58:21.430
LIAM: Diarchy?
MATT: Yes.

3894
02:58:21.430 --> 02:58:23.455
That's what you get for a 25 history roll.

LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

3896
02:58:24.288 --> 02:58:26.840
Is this like a small, rugged place

3897
02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:30.090
or very civilized and built out?

3898
02:58:30.090 --> 02:58:32.170
MATT: What you see right now on the side of the mountain,

3899
02:58:32.170 --> 02:58:34.030
there are the towers, there's some perimeter fences,

3900
02:58:34.030 --> 02:58:36.840
you can see a number of small buildings

3901
02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:39.460
warmed by gentle firelight, thatched roofs.

3902
02:58:39.460 --> 02:58:43.340
They're fit to be, you know, fairly sturdy

3903
02:58:43.340 --> 02:58:44.680
in the months of harsh weather,

3904
02:58:44.680 --> 02:58:46.040
which, as you've now noticed,

3905
02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:48.830
occasionally blows through the alps here.

3906
02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:52.320
You also can tell there are some winterbred horses

3907
02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:54.270
and large goats that are kept outside of

3908
02:58:54.270 --> 02:58:57.550
makeshift liveries and some of the perimeter guards,

3909
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:58.770
you can now see on the edges of it,

3910
02:58:58.770 --> 02:59:00.850
are using these as mounts as they walk across

3911
02:59:00.850 --> 02:59:03.260
and these are large goats, they're, you know,

3912
02:59:03.260 --> 02:59:07.950
probably from foot to shoulder, about eight feet tall.

3913
02:59:07.950 --> 02:59:10.040
SAM: Goats?
LAURA: Goats, are they dire goats?

3914
02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:14.180
MATT: They're squat, so they're almost circular, but,

3915
02:59:14.180 --> 02:59:16.280
what was the question?
LAURA: Are they dire goats?

3916
02:59:16.280 --> 02:59:17.140
MATT: They're not dire goats.

3917
02:59:17.140 --> 02:59:19.340
You don't see any additional bony protrusions

3918
02:59:19.340 --> 02:59:22.130
or a nightmareish hint to them, they're just large

3919
02:59:22.130 --> 02:59:24.054
and sturdy.

MATT: A lot of it's fur.

3922
02:59:27.693 --> 02:59:29.140
You're not quite sure where the shoulder stands,

3923
02:59:29.140 --> 02:59:31.020
but from the fur wreath around the head

3924
02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:33.131
and that it stands about

3925
02:59:33.131 --> 02:59:33.964
eight foot tall.
TRAVIS: If we yell boom!

3926
02:59:33.964 --> 02:59:35.821
Do the eight-foot tall goats fall over?

3927
02:59:35.821 --> 02:59:37.149
MATT: You want to try it?

3928
02:59:37.149 --> 02:59:38.340
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3929

(screaming).

3935
03:00:00.417 --> 03:00:03.180
MATT: As the large, muscular, massive-shouldered goat

3936
03:00:03.180 --> 03:00:06.890
with its square eyes, pupils, in some ways

3937
03:00:06.890 --> 03:00:08.540
reminiscent up close, in the eyes,

3938
03:00:08.540 --> 03:00:12.100
as to a moorbounder, turns around to you (smacking).

3939
03:00:12.100 --> 03:00:13.991
What do you do?

3940
03:00:13.991 --> 03:00:15.420
TRAVIS: Boo!
MATT: (bleating)

3941
03:00:15.420 --> 03:00:19.470
It bolts in the opposite direction (thudding),

3942
03:00:19.470 --> 03:00:21.190
slams into the side of the gate.

3943
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:23.150
The gate (booms), splinters open

3944
03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:26.050
and it begins running out along the side of the mountain.

3945
03:00:26.050 --> 03:00:27.480
A couple of the other goats begin to follow

3946
03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:28.820
the opening space and a bunch of the--

3947
03:00:28.820 --> 03:00:31.061
Glassblades begin to rush off

3948
03:00:31.061 --> 03:00:33.919
to try and get them back into the fence.

3949
03:00:33.919 --> 03:00:36.931
[laughter]

3950
03:00:36.931 --> 03:00:41.597
[cheering]

3951
03:00:44.610 --> 03:00:47.120
SAM: Walk away, walk away.

3952
03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:49.530
TRAVIS: Nott, how could you do that?

3953
03:00:49.530 --> 03:00:54.530
SAM: I'm sorry, I'm drunk!

3954
03:00:55.020 --> 03:00:57.490
MATT: The guards seem to not particularly

3955
03:00:57.490 --> 03:00:59.440
appreciate your presence at the moment.

3956
03:01:00.330 --> 03:01:01.970
Looking around, you do see

3957
03:01:01.970 --> 03:01:05.100
a large, heavy gazebo-type roof structure

3958
03:01:05.100 --> 03:01:08.044
in the center. You must face the gazebo alone.

3959
03:01:08.044 --> 03:01:09.650
(laughter)

3960
03:01:09.650 --> 03:01:12.130
You can see beneath the roof of it,

3961
03:01:12.130 --> 03:01:16.090
there is a wide pit where the snow and the ice and the rock

3962
03:01:16.090 --> 03:01:17.730
tends to give away and you can see probably

3963
03:01:17.730 --> 03:01:20.190
50, 60 feet across, from side to side,

3964
03:01:20.190 --> 03:01:21.850
just a black, circular opening

3965
03:01:21.850 --> 03:01:24.920
that descends deep into the mountain rock.

3966
03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:26.170
LAURA: Huh?

3967
03:01:26.170 --> 03:01:27.580
SAM: Are there stairs?

3968
03:01:27.580 --> 03:01:28.750
MATT: Do you approach it?

3969
03:01:28.750 --> 03:01:30.330
SAM: Yes!
LAURA: Wait, wait.

3970
03:01:30.330 --> 03:01:31.230
SAM: Yes!

3971
03:01:32.290 --> 03:01:34.870
LAURA: I mean, this is Uthodurn, right?

3972
03:01:34.870 --> 03:01:36.390
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

3973
03:01:36.390 --> 03:01:37.223
TALIESIN: We're assuming.

3974
03:01:37.223 --> 03:01:38.870
MATT: May or may not be, you haven't asked the question.

3975
03:01:38.870 --> 03:01:40.570
LIAM: Seems like the outskirts.

3976
03:01:40.570 --> 03:01:42.923
Are we in Uthodurn proper?
MATT: One of the guards

3977
03:01:42.923 --> 03:01:47.923
that passes by, you see an elven man, hood still up.

3978
03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:50.520
It's interesting, the features are pure elven,

3979
03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:52.130
but you see elements

3980
03:01:52.130 --> 03:01:54.820
of a reddish-brown beard

3981
03:01:54.820 --> 03:01:55.870
that has emerged from the chin.

3982
03:01:55.870 --> 03:01:59.020
He looks at you and goes, "Aye,"

3983
03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:01.150
and points towards the hole.

3984
03:02:01.150 --> 03:02:03.988
SAM: Oh, oh, it's down there.

3985
03:02:03.988 --> 03:02:05.304
LIAM: Down below, in the underground.

3986
03:02:05.304 --> 03:02:06.137
MATT: You glance over and you can see,

3987
03:02:06.137 --> 03:02:06.970
now that you're getting closer,

3988
03:02:06.970 --> 03:02:09.370
there are numerous spiral staircases

3989
03:02:09.370 --> 03:02:12.250
that descend down, about 15 feet wide each,

3990
03:02:12.250 --> 03:02:13.083
that continue on.

3991
03:02:13.083 --> 03:02:14.110
There's railing around the outer edge

3992
03:02:14.110 --> 03:02:16.260
and you can see there are guards posted there as well,

3993
03:02:16.260 --> 03:02:18.330
keeping an eye on anyone going in and out.

3994
03:02:18.330 --> 03:02:19.720
SAM: Uthodurn.

3995
03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:21.660
Earthadown.

3996
03:02:21.660 --> 03:02:25.310
Maybe, it's like, maybe, I don't know?

3997
03:02:25.310 --> 03:02:28.980
MARISHA: It's Dwarvish. I actually speak Dwarvish.

3998
03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:30.432
SAM: Yeah, what does it translate to?

3999
03:02:30.432 --> 03:02:33.660
MARISHA: I, what does it translate to?

4000
03:02:33.660 --> 03:02:36.040
MATT: I'd say Uthodurn translates roughly to

4001
03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:40.330
"the new under salvation."

4002
03:02:41.770 --> 03:02:43.976
MARISHA: Well, you see--
SAM: Let's go.

4003
03:02:43.976 --> 03:02:46.559
(laughter)

4004
03:02:47.550 --> 03:02:51.478
MATT: So you guys continue down this spiral network

4005
03:02:51.478 --> 03:02:54.703
of staircases that descend for

4006
03:02:54.703 --> 03:02:57.869
100, 150 or so feet.

4007
03:02:57.869 --> 03:02:59.480
There is railing on the edge to make sure

4008
03:02:59.480 --> 03:03:01.060
that nobody plummets in, because the center of it

4009
03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:03.420
is an open pit that just falls straight through.

4010
03:03:03.420 --> 03:03:05.653
TALIESIN: Well, that's a refreshing change of pace.

4011
03:03:05.653 --> 03:03:07.894
(Matt laughs)

4012
03:03:07.894 --> 03:03:09.451
MATT: There are people that come up and pass by

4013
03:03:09.451 --> 03:03:10.960
and you have to move to the side

4014
03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:13.870
as you can see some other of these Glassblade rangers,

4015
03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:16.970
you can see some people with backpacks,

4016
03:03:16.970 --> 03:03:19.370
ready to face the elements,

4017
03:03:19.370 --> 03:03:21.820
with heavy cloaks and heavy hoods,

4018
03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:23.954
thick furs, and thick leathers and hides,

4019
03:03:23.954 --> 03:03:27.060
passing by you as you descend deeper, deeper

4020
03:03:27.060 --> 03:03:29.540
into this section of the mountain before,

4021
03:03:29.540 --> 03:03:31.690
eventually, the staircase stop in what is like

4022
03:03:31.690 --> 03:03:35.940
a large, semi-domed, a foyer path

4023
03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:38.210
that is about a hundred feet across, side to side,

4024
03:03:38.210 --> 03:03:41.230
and you can see multiple hallways that lead outward.

4025
03:03:41.230 --> 03:03:46.168
The smell in here is that of wet earth,

4026
03:03:47.370 --> 03:03:52.370
burned wood, soot, and an iron-like scent to the air.

4027
03:03:53.837 --> 03:03:56.110
LIAM: "Iron-like."

4028
03:03:56.110 --> 03:03:58.270
Nott and I mess a lot with components.

4029
03:03:58.270 --> 03:04:01.540
Do we know if it is something specific?

4030
03:04:01.540 --> 03:04:03.910
MATT: Iron.
SAM: (laughs)

4031
03:04:05.962 --> 03:04:09.460
It's very iron-like.

4032
03:04:09.460 --> 03:04:12.602
LIAM: Could have just said iron.

4033
03:04:12.602 --> 03:04:17.004
SAM: It's ironish, it's ironic.

4034
03:04:17.004 --> 03:04:18.860
TRAVIS: What's the difference in the temperature

4035
03:04:18.860 --> 03:04:20.490
from where we are now to where we were?

4036
03:04:20.490 --> 03:04:21.870
MATT: Much warmer.

4037
03:04:21.870 --> 03:04:23.835
As you come down and you've made your way down the stairs,

4038
03:04:23.835 --> 03:04:26.810
you're starting to sweat a bit beneath

4039
03:04:26.810 --> 03:04:29.170
the thicker clothing that you've used

4040
03:04:29.170 --> 03:04:32.130
to make your way through the open, snowy wastes

4041
03:04:32.130 --> 03:04:34.180
of this mountain range.

4042
03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:35.450
MARISHA: Are there crickets down here?

4043
03:04:35.450 --> 03:04:38.100
SAM: Yeah, that's crickets.
MATT: That's interesting.

4044
03:04:38.100 --> 03:04:40.880
Not what I wanted (laughs).

4045
03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:41.900
SAM: Careful, there's

4046
03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:44.190
dire crickets everywhere.
TRAVIS: Under New Salvation:

4047
03:04:44.190 --> 03:04:47.220
cricket haven.

4048
03:04:47.220 --> 03:04:49.700
MATT: All right, so what I was looking for

4049
03:04:49.700 --> 03:04:51.340
was not cricket sounds.

4050
03:04:53.230 --> 03:04:55.490
SAM: ♪ Apple bottom jeans! ♪

4051
03:04:56.570 --> 03:04:58.420
SAM: Fur!

4052
03:04:58.420 --> 03:05:00.052
MATT: Don't you dare.

4053
03:05:00.052 --> 03:05:01.960
[laughter]

4054
03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:03.950
There it is, that's what I wanted.

4055
03:05:03.950 --> 03:05:06.140
Thank you for your patience.

4056
03:05:06.140 --> 03:05:07.460
All right, so.

4057
03:05:08.390 --> 03:05:10.580
Coming down into this space,

4058
03:05:10.580 --> 03:05:14.180
you can see it opens up into, on each side,

4059
03:05:14.180 --> 03:05:16.200
pockets of almost barracks

4060
03:05:16.200 --> 03:05:18.150
built into the edge of this where you can see

4061
03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:21.790
numerous Glassblades are currently at watch

4062
03:05:21.790 --> 03:05:24.710
or heading into buildings built into the side

4063
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:27.930
of this large dome, you can see little balcony pathways,

4064
03:05:27.930 --> 03:05:30.130
you can see areas of the outside where

4065
03:05:30.130 --> 03:05:32.680
different weapons and large bells are situated

4066
03:05:32.680 --> 03:05:35.880
and placed up and hung against the side of the wall.

4067
03:05:35.880 --> 03:05:38.680
There is a very wide opening,

4068
03:05:38.680 --> 03:05:40.410
affront of you and to the left

4069
03:05:40.410 --> 03:05:42.890
that seems to open up into a city.

4070
03:05:42.890 --> 03:05:46.830
You can see a central, wide road, maybe 30 feet across,

4071
03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:49.630
where various small carts and stuff are set up on the edges

4072
03:05:49.630 --> 03:05:50.910
and buildings,

4073
03:05:50.910 --> 03:05:53.820
as it slowly curves to the left.

4074
03:05:53.820 --> 03:05:54.653
LAURA: Wow.

4075
03:05:56.116 --> 03:05:57.500
This is really cool!

4076
03:05:57.500 --> 03:06:00.888
TALIESIN: This is very, very nice.

4077
03:06:00.888 --> 03:06:04.577
Let's maybe find a way to get ourselves situated?

4078
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:07.100
LAURA: We should go towards the city.

4079
03:06:07.100 --> 03:06:09.610
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, that thing.
LAURA: Yeah.

4080
03:06:09.610 --> 03:06:10.890
MATT: As you head out through the central tunnel

4081
03:06:10.890 --> 03:06:14.470
and it opens up around you, this is a massive

4082
03:06:14.470 --> 03:06:17.130
underground cavern, from floor to ceiling,

4083
03:06:17.130 --> 03:06:20.670
probably close to 100 to 120 feet high

4084
03:06:20.670 --> 03:06:24.990
and hundreds of feet wide, side to side.

4085
03:06:24.990 --> 03:06:28.560
Like close to maybe 1500 feet or more.

4086
03:06:28.560 --> 03:06:31.930
In that space, this wide, very, very

4087
03:06:31.930 --> 03:06:35.620
pinched, from the top, arched cavern,

4088
03:06:35.620 --> 03:06:38.320
there are just buildings that sprawl out.

4089
03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:42.600
This is an underground neighborhood that continues.

4090
03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:47.600
As it descends, it curves, like a gargantuan auger

4091
03:06:47.700 --> 03:06:49.860
that just slowly spirals deeper

4092
03:06:49.860 --> 03:06:51.790
and deeper into the earth.

4093
03:06:51.790 --> 03:06:53.350
You can hear all manner of voices

4094
03:06:53.350 --> 03:06:56.410
shouting and laughing and making comments and

4095
03:06:56.410 --> 03:06:59.060
aggressive grunts as various individuals

4096
03:06:59.060 --> 03:07:01.070
are coming through, carrying large

4097
03:07:01.070 --> 03:07:02.810
mine carts filled with

4098
03:07:02.810 --> 03:07:05.070
freshly-mined iron and other minerals from

4099
03:07:05.070 --> 03:07:07.840
a mining works off to the far right

4100
03:07:07.840 --> 03:07:11.070
that encompasses a heavy side of this entryway.

4101
03:07:11.070 --> 03:07:13.579
To the left, you can see other residential buildings,

4102
03:07:13.579 --> 03:07:15.530
which is interesting, because along the base of it,

4103
03:07:15.530 --> 03:07:17.740
you can see more squat-heavy stone buildings,

4104
03:07:17.740 --> 03:07:20.070
and built up against the wall, curving up,

4105
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:23.330
as the cave meets the edge of its sides,

4106
03:07:23.330 --> 03:07:27.720
you can see more elven-based homes.

4107
03:07:27.720 --> 03:07:29.240
In this weird in-between,

4108
03:07:29.240 --> 03:07:30.760
you can see where the merging cultures

4109
03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:33.050
between dwarf and elf, classically at odds,

4110
03:07:33.050 --> 03:07:36.690
or at least very, very dissimilar lifestyles

4111
03:07:36.690 --> 03:07:40.090
have come into this symbiotic existence together.

4112
03:07:40.090 --> 03:07:42.120
There, amongst the people of Uthodurn,

4113
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:47.120
while primarily dwarvish, a lot of elves walking through.

4114
03:07:47.190 --> 03:07:51.100
Elven children, couples of dwarves, and elves,

4115
03:07:51.100 --> 03:07:52.940
and dwarf and elf together.

4116
03:07:52.940 --> 03:07:56.970
It is a complete merger of the societies.

4117
03:07:56.970 --> 03:07:59.733
LAURA: Wow, so it is possible.

4118
03:07:59.733 --> 03:08:02.620
[laughter]

4119
03:08:02.620 --> 03:08:06.030
TRAVIS: We see the landscape moving down and to the left.

4120
03:08:06.030 --> 03:08:08.110
You said the entrance into this area

4121
03:08:08.110 --> 03:08:09.970
was a circle in the ground.

4122
03:08:09.970 --> 03:08:11.850
MATT: Right, it was like a spherical dome

4123
03:08:11.850 --> 03:08:13.930
that the staircases came down with

4124
03:08:13.930 --> 03:08:14.920
and then you had

4125
03:08:14.920 --> 03:08:16.500
elements of barracks that went off to the sides

4126
03:08:16.500 --> 03:08:17.960
and then one central opening

4127
03:08:17.960 --> 03:08:19.860
that opened into this neighborhood.

4128
03:08:19.860 --> 03:08:22.690
TRAVIS: Does the cavern look like it's circular

4129
03:08:22.690 --> 03:08:25.690
and that it moves down as if it was an enormous tunnel?

4130
03:08:25.690 --> 03:08:26.740
MATT: As if it was a large tunnel.

4131
03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:27.700
You can see it's roughly hewn

4132
03:08:27.700 --> 03:08:29.420
and there are numerous pillars throughout

4133
03:08:29.420 --> 03:08:30.780
that rise up to meet the ceiling

4134
03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:33.710
to both maintain the weight and give this

4135
03:08:33.710 --> 03:08:37.580
grandiose, massively-scaled grand hall

4136
03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:39.600
feel to it as you see people pass through,

4137
03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:41.533
deeper into the city.

4138
03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:44.970
TRAVIS: I mean, we should move forward, yes?

4139
03:08:44.970 --> 03:08:46.340
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah.

4140
03:08:46.340 --> 03:08:49.022
MARISHA: Do we want to try and find a place to stay or?

4141
03:08:49.022 --> 03:08:51.400
LIAM: Yeah, maybe find a base of operations and

4142
03:08:51.400 --> 03:08:53.750
start asking questions there and work our way outward.

4143
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:55.400
SAM: Beau, you speak Dwarvish,

4144
03:08:55.400 --> 03:08:57.727
maybe you should chat up a local.

4145
03:08:57.727 --> 03:09:00.283
TALIESIN: Is there a-- Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

4146
03:09:00.283 --> 03:09:02.850
[laughter]

4147
03:09:02.850 --> 03:09:06.220
I just, you know, I would like to point out that

4148
03:09:06.220 --> 03:09:08.660
it was just in class.

4149
03:09:08.660 --> 03:09:11.350
My teacher who taught me this was actually elvish.

4150
03:09:11.350 --> 03:09:14.660
It was super ironic now that I think about it.

4151
03:09:14.660 --> 03:09:18.180
So I haven't had a lot of practice with it.

4152
03:09:18.180 --> 03:09:20.813
LAURA: You'll be great.
MARISHA: Okay.

4153
03:09:22.110 --> 03:09:26.650
I find a friendly-looking

4154
03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:30.440
dwarf guard person?

4155
03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:32.010
TRAVIS: Are the Glassblades noticeable

4156
03:09:32.010 --> 03:09:33.970
amongst everyone else that's walking around?

4157
03:09:33.970 --> 03:09:36.080
MATT: You do see a few, but they're mostly just

4158
03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:38.250
patrolling the streets as would a townsguard

4159
03:09:38.250 --> 03:09:40.430
you're familiar with in the Empire

4160
03:09:40.430 --> 03:09:43.740
or, you know, Zhelezo would on the Menagerie Coast.

4161
03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:45.800
They seem to be more essentially relegated

4162
03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:47.660
towards the entrance and places where

4163
03:09:47.660 --> 03:09:49.840
conflict would be more of

4164
03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:52.500
a defensible position of conflict within the city,

4165
03:09:52.500 --> 03:09:53.470
but they're scattered about.

4166
03:09:53.470 --> 03:09:55.720
Otherwise, you see other folks across the town,

4167
03:09:55.720 --> 03:09:58.930
dwarf and elvish and, occasionally, other folks as well.

4168
03:09:58.930 --> 03:10:02.070
You see the sporadic human, the sporadic half-orc.

4169
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:05.319
They're not purely dwarf and elf, just primarily.

4170
03:10:05.319 --> 03:10:06.152
TRAVIS: What about smokestacks?

4171
03:10:06.152 --> 03:10:09.502
Anything that would denote a fire or something?

4172
03:10:09.502 --> 03:10:11.530
MATT: You see a lot of firelight

4173
03:10:11.530 --> 03:10:12.990
throughout some of the homes and abodes,

4174
03:10:12.990 --> 03:10:15.210
but what you notice is a lot of the buildings that have that

4175
03:10:15.210 --> 03:10:17.960
are clustered around the base of these large pillars

4176
03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:21.600
and the chimneys are built in a slant that merge

4177
03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:23.530
with the mountain itself.

4178
03:10:23.530 --> 03:10:26.530
These pillars not just act as base pillars

4179
03:10:26.530 --> 03:10:28.341
but seem to be in some sort of a funneling

4180
03:10:28.341 --> 03:10:31.770
exit for the various bits of smoke and soot

4181
03:10:31.770 --> 03:10:35.690
that are built up through the various works being done here.

4182
03:10:35.690 --> 03:10:37.070
MARISHA: Cool.

4183
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:40.363
MATT: So you look around for, who do you want to talk to?

4184
03:10:40.363 --> 03:10:44.310
A regular townie, you want to talk to one of the Glassblades

4185
03:10:44.310 --> 03:10:45.580
what are you thinking?
MARISHA: Yeah,

4186
03:10:45.580 --> 03:10:47.690
I'll look for a Glassblade

4187
03:10:47.690 --> 03:10:49.490
that just looks like he's on patrol.

4188
03:10:49.490 --> 03:10:51.957
MATT: Okay, you see a female Glassblade approach,

4189
03:10:51.957 --> 03:10:55.540
similar armor. The heavy cloak is not present.

4190
03:10:55.540 --> 03:10:57.860
It's a lighter cloak.

4191
03:10:57.860 --> 03:11:00.090
Similar look and attire.

4192
03:11:00.090 --> 03:11:05.010
The armor has a dull, gray-gold motif to it.

4193
03:11:05.010 --> 03:11:06.590
You can see, across the front of it,

4194
03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:07.680
there is an emblem.

4195
03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:10.800
It looks like a sideways look of a warhammer.

4196
03:11:10.800 --> 03:11:12.330
One half is white,

4197
03:11:12.330 --> 03:11:15.890
like the hook part of the warhammer is white,

4198
03:11:15.890 --> 03:11:18.320
the front, the blunt edge of the warhammer is black,

4199
03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:19.620
and where they merge, there is a center,

4200
03:11:19.620 --> 03:11:20.610
it looks almost like a yin-yang,

4201
03:11:20.610 --> 03:11:22.410
where the two colors are opposite,

4202
03:11:22.410 --> 03:11:24.620
symbolizing the merger of the two societies.

4203
03:11:24.620 --> 03:11:26.336
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

4204
03:11:28.030 --> 03:11:29.490
Hey, how are you doing?

4205
03:11:29.490 --> 03:11:31.735
MATT: She walks up.

4206
03:11:31.735 --> 03:11:35.100
"I'm working."
MARISHA: Sure.

4207
03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:37.800
We were just curious if you could point us in the direction

4208
03:11:37.800 --> 03:11:39.780
of a local tavern or an inn,

4209
03:11:39.780 --> 03:11:41.350
somewhere we could get some food.

4210
03:11:41.350 --> 03:11:42.360
Maybe some rest.

4211
03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:44.790
MATT: "Here on the Volition Disc.

4212
03:11:44.790 --> 03:11:47.560
"Yeah, take the Auger Trail down about maybe

4213
03:11:47.560 --> 03:11:51.090
"five or six blocks and you'll see The Broken Stool."

4214
03:11:51.090 --> 03:11:51.923
MARISHA: Wait, what's that?

4215
03:11:51.923 --> 03:11:55.340
MATT: "The Broken Stool's a tavern."
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

4216
03:11:55.340 --> 03:11:57.520
Five or six blocks on the left?

4217
03:11:57.520 --> 03:11:58.370
MATT: "Correct."

4218
03:11:58.370 --> 03:12:00.310
MARISHA: Any other taverns or that's probably--

4219
03:12:00.310 --> 03:12:01.620
MATT: "That's the one's closest here.

4220
03:12:01.620 --> 03:12:03.090
"It's got rooms."

4221
03:12:03.090 --> 03:12:05.600
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4222
03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:07.480
MATT: "I'm not going to guide you around the city."

4223
03:12:07.480 --> 03:12:09.010
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, I'm just--

4224
03:12:09.010 --> 03:12:09.950
MATT: "It's not my job.

4225
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:12.220
"I'm supposed to protect people.

4226
03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:13.760
"Keep the law

4227
03:12:13.760 --> 03:12:14.830
"from getting broken."

4228
03:12:14.830 --> 03:12:18.030
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, you're doing--
MATT: "I'm going to go."

4229
03:12:18.030 --> 03:12:21.410
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

4230
03:12:21.410 --> 03:12:23.840
MATT: She keeps walking, continuing her patrol.

4231
03:12:23.840 --> 03:12:25.080
SAM: You did great!
LIAM: Your voice

4232
03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:27.270
becomes even more guttural than usual

4233
03:12:27.270 --> 03:12:29.880
when you're speaking dwarven.

4234
03:12:29.880 --> 03:12:31.970
Did you find a place?
MARISHA: Well, it has that

4235
03:12:31.970 --> 03:12:33.620
guttural, like, (coughing) to it

4236
03:12:33.620 --> 03:12:36.560
that you have to get.

4237
03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:41.160
Anyway, yeah, I point us in the direction of the.

4238
03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:41.993
LAURA: Broken Stool?

4239
03:12:41.993 --> 03:12:44.782
MARISHA: Broken Stool.
MATT: Broken Stool.

4240
03:12:44.782 --> 03:12:46.650
You continue on down,

4241
03:12:46.650 --> 03:12:48.410
keeping an eye out, and eventually,

4242
03:12:48.410 --> 03:12:51.120
you do come across a

4243
03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:54.720
two-story inn with a tavern and the exterior, you can see,

4244
03:12:54.720 --> 03:12:57.730
hanging underneath, the warm lit interior,

4245
03:12:57.730 --> 03:13:02.110
just underneath where the outside porch is situated,

4246
03:13:02.110 --> 03:13:05.040
hanging on a chain is a stool at an odd angle

4247
03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:06.980
and it looks like it's missing one of its feet.

4248
03:13:06.980 --> 03:13:09.530
It's partially broken off and that's just the symbol

4249
03:13:09.530 --> 03:13:11.140
for its space here.
MARISHA: You know,

4250
03:13:11.140 --> 03:13:14.700
it's got great theme-ing, it leans into its name.

4251
03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:15.975
I'm into it.
TALIESIN: It has to lean.

4252
03:13:15.975 --> 03:13:20.530
It only has three legs, it needs to, yeah.

4253
03:13:20.530 --> 03:13:21.900
MARISHA: All right, we go in.

4254
03:13:21.900 --> 03:13:22.820
MATT: You wander inside.

4255
03:13:22.820 --> 03:13:25.340
It's comfortable, the tavern floor is wide here,

4256
03:13:25.340 --> 03:13:26.580
like you're used to seeing, you know,

4257
03:13:26.580 --> 03:13:27.900
you've been to a few wide taverns.

4258
03:13:27.900 --> 03:13:30.310
The Hupperdook one was fairly expansive.

4259
03:13:30.310 --> 03:13:33.780
This has probably 15 tables or so

4260
03:13:33.780 --> 03:13:36.236
and about half of them are full.

4261
03:13:36.236 --> 03:13:39.110
As you've now come into the dusk hour of the day,

4262
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:42.210
it looks like a lot of various miners have come out,

4263
03:13:42.210 --> 03:13:43.500
miners as they work in the mine,

4264
03:13:43.500 --> 03:13:45.020
not minors as in underage.

4265
03:13:45.020 --> 03:13:47.210
(laughter)

4266
03:13:47.210 --> 03:13:49.370
Though you're not sure what the drinking age

4267
03:13:49.370 --> 03:13:50.760
is here in Uthodurn.

4268
03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:54.330
Probably a little more lax being dwarven.

4269
03:13:54.330 --> 03:13:57.570
So you see a number of these people covered in soot,

4270
03:13:57.570 --> 03:13:59.400
tough-looking figures, some of them

4271
03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:01.510
carrying various wounds of the job

4272
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:04.047
and look to be maybe issues with either

4273
03:14:04.047 --> 03:14:07.930
miner collapses or creatures they've stumbled across

4274
03:14:07.930 --> 03:14:10.080
and they're all just drinking and talking

4275
03:14:10.080 --> 03:14:12.630
and sloshing around and chatting.

4276
03:14:12.630 --> 03:14:14.240
There, at the far end of the bar,

4277
03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:17.480
you can see there were a few male and female barhands

4278
03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:19.220
in the process of setting up drinks and such

4279
03:14:19.220 --> 03:14:21.300
and you see, standing, looking over,

4280
03:14:21.300 --> 03:14:24.320
and shouting small orders to them,

4281
03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:28.060
you see a female dwarf, older, gray-brown hair,

4282
03:14:28.060 --> 03:14:31.327
it's pulled back into a messy bun that (poofs)

4283
03:14:31.327 --> 03:14:32.970
from the back of her head.

4284
03:14:32.970 --> 03:14:34.630
Thick mutton chops that come down

4285
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:36.900
right to the edge of her chin and stop.

4286
03:14:36.900 --> 03:14:39.550
Looks like a series of scars across her chin

4287
03:14:39.550 --> 03:14:41.975
and the edge of her clavicle.

4288
03:14:41.975 --> 03:14:44.628
She looks to be the one in charge.

4289
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:47.660
MARISHA: Excuse me, is it open seating

4290
03:14:47.660 --> 03:14:50.380
or do we need to put in for a table?

4291
03:14:50.380 --> 03:14:52.638
MATT: "Yeah, you can certainly find something to sit,

4292
03:14:52.638 --> 03:14:53.471
"go for it.

4293
03:14:53.471 --> 03:14:55.800
"Take a bite, sit down."
MARISHA: Thank you.

4294
03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:57.220
MATT: "'Course, 'course.

4295
03:14:57.220 --> 03:14:58.870
"So this is your group here?"

4296
03:14:58.870 --> 03:15:00.511
MARISHA: Yeah, this is my posse,

4297
03:15:00.511 --> 03:15:02.330
they're rolling with me, you know.

4298
03:15:02.330 --> 03:15:05.080
MATT: "Just getting drinks, are you getting food as well?"

4299
03:15:05.080 --> 03:15:06.421
MARISHA: Food, drinks, and

4300
03:15:06.421 --> 03:15:08.704
you wouldn't happen to have any room?

4301
03:15:08.704 --> 03:15:10.690
Rooms?

4302
03:15:10.690 --> 03:15:12.610
MATT: "We could probably squeeze two rooms in

4303
03:15:12.610 --> 03:15:14.600
"if you don't mind sharing, huh?"

4304
03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:16.300
MARISHA: Yeah, we're cozy.

4305
03:15:16.300 --> 03:15:18.030
MATT: "All right, I'm Luda, what's your name?"

4306
03:15:18.030 --> 03:15:19.330
MARISHA: Lunda?
MATT: "Luda."

4307
03:15:19.330 --> 03:15:20.770
MARISHA: Luda, Beauregard.

4308
03:15:20.770 --> 03:15:22.280
MATT: "You got to work on your "oh" sounds in Dwarven."

4309
03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:24.170
MARISHA: Luda, okay--
MATT: "That's fine."

4310
03:15:24.170 --> 03:15:26.060
MARISHA: I am new to it, so if you could just--

4311
03:15:26.060 --> 03:15:30.162
MATT: "I could tell."
MARISHA: Hmm.

4312
03:15:30.162 --> 03:15:32.100
MATT: "I'm not judging, actually, it feels nice

4313
03:15:32.100 --> 03:15:33.660
"that you're at least putting some effort into it."

4314
03:15:33.660 --> 03:15:35.360
MARISHA: Thank you.
MATT: "Not just assuming."

4315
03:15:36.660 --> 03:15:38.130
MARISHA: Luda.
MATT: "Aye."

4316
03:15:38.130 --> 03:15:40.530
MARISHA: I'm Beauregard.
MATT: "Pleasure.

4317
03:15:40.530 --> 03:15:41.363
"Where you from?

4318
03:15:41.363 --> 03:15:43.460
"You don't look like you're locals.

4319
03:15:43.460 --> 03:15:47.600
"You're all wearing some strange clothing."

4320
03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:49.918
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, we're traveling from Rosohna

4321
03:15:49.918 --> 03:15:51.650
on a little bit of a mission.

4322
03:15:51.650 --> 03:15:53.440
MATT: "Don't know what that is, but good on ya."

4323
03:15:53.440 --> 03:15:55.140
MARISHA: Okay, good.

4324
03:15:55.140 --> 03:15:56.480
Just passing through.

4325
03:15:56.480 --> 03:16:01.140
We actually just came from Kravinraad.

4326
03:16:01.140 --> 03:16:05.357
MATT: "You went to Kravaraad?! That's the fucking volcano!

4327
03:16:05.357 --> 03:16:08.912
"What's to find there?"

4328
03:16:08.912 --> 03:16:13.912
MARISHA: An entire family of people, it turns out.

4329
03:16:14.060 --> 03:16:15.625
MATT: "Weird."
MARISHA: Yeah.

4330
03:16:15.625 --> 03:16:18.230
[laughter]

4331
03:16:18.230 --> 03:16:20.380
MATT: "I hope it went well, your reunion.

4332
03:16:20.380 --> 03:16:22.340
"Anyway, you want rooms, I got two rooms.

4333
03:16:22.340 --> 03:16:26.270
"There are, looking over here," looking for the,

4334
03:16:26.270 --> 03:16:31.270
this would be, "per room, five silver pieces a night."

4335
03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:34.300
MARISHA: Oh, I toss her a gold and just.

4336
03:16:35.560 --> 03:16:37.226
MATT: "Look at that, exact change.

4337
03:16:37.226 --> 03:16:38.770
"Two rooms, here's your keys.

4338
03:16:38.770 --> 03:16:41.940
"As so."
[laughter]

4339
03:16:43.470 --> 03:16:46.660
MARISHA: What's the local beverage of choice?

4340
03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:49.900
MATT: "Ale."
MARISHA: Dope.

4341
03:16:49.900 --> 03:16:52.280
Can we have a round over there?

4342
03:16:52.280 --> 03:16:55.008
MATT: "I think we can manage."

4343
03:16:55.008 --> 03:16:56.280
She goes ahead and gathers up drinks,

4344
03:16:56.280 --> 03:16:58.920
you guys find a table and kind of,

4345
03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:01.400
after an exhausted journey, making your way to Uthodurn,

4346
03:17:01.400 --> 03:17:04.350
you sit around, ale is provided, drink is provided,

4347
03:17:04.350 --> 03:17:05.490
you have rooms for the night.

4348
03:17:05.490 --> 03:17:06.960
What would you like to do?

4349
03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:10.150
SAM: Should we talk to the locals about Smeltborne

4350
03:17:10.150 --> 03:17:12.220
or anything else--
LAURA: Or Dulgrim?

4351
03:17:12.220 --> 03:17:13.750
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Smeltborne,

4352
03:17:13.750 --> 03:17:14.860
at the very least, we should start--

4353
03:17:14.860 --> 03:17:16.590
LAURA: Does anybody speak Common?

4354
03:17:17.530 --> 03:17:19.762
TALIESIN: I mean, I do.
LAURA: Oh.

4355
03:17:19.762 --> 03:17:21.700
[laughter]

4356
03:17:21.700 --> 03:17:22.866
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: I think she meant

4357
03:17:22.866 --> 03:17:23.699
the locals.
LAURA: Hey, Caduceus,

4358
03:17:23.699 --> 03:17:26.375
do you know where Dulgrim Smeltborne's

4359
03:17:26.375 --> 03:17:28.830
place is?

4360
03:17:28.830 --> 03:17:30.060
TALIESIN: Not off the top of my head.
LAURA: Okay.

4361
03:17:30.060 --> 03:17:32.040
Maybe we should ask somebody else, then.

4362
03:17:32.040 --> 03:17:32.873
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4363
03:17:34.830 --> 03:17:36.046
MARISHA: Are people speaking Common,

4364
03:17:36.046 --> 03:17:37.179
or are they all pretty much

4365
03:17:37.179 --> 03:17:38.580
speaking Dwarven and Elvish?

4366
03:17:38.580 --> 03:17:40.340
MATT: Actually, no, there are conversation in Elvish,

4367
03:17:40.340 --> 03:17:41.350
there are conversations in Dwarven,

4368
03:17:41.350 --> 03:17:43.160
and there are conversations in Common.

4369
03:17:43.160 --> 03:17:46.512
Common is, believe it or not, a common language here.

4370
03:17:46.512 --> 03:17:48.830
[laughter]

4371
03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:51.300
Especially as part of the unification of the Diarchy,

4372
03:17:51.300 --> 03:17:54.750
so, yeah, it looks like common is readily used here,

4373
03:17:54.750 --> 03:17:58.070
but all languages flow freely,

4374
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:59.150
probably in even amounts.

4375
03:17:59.150 --> 03:18:02.450
SAM: Anyone around the tavern who looks like

4376
03:18:02.450 --> 03:18:05.300
they're the center of a conversation

4377
03:18:05.300 --> 03:18:10.150
or holding court or have a lot of friends around them?

4378
03:18:10.150 --> 03:18:12.240
MATT: Make a perception check.
SAM: Oh, I'm good at that.

4379
03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:15.440
10.

4380
03:18:15.440 --> 03:18:18.860
MATT: You see one elf who is wearing

4381
03:18:18.860 --> 03:18:22.940
some sort of a leather apron of some kind.

4382
03:18:22.940 --> 03:18:25.422
It's a bit covered in dirt and smoot.

4383
03:18:25.422 --> 03:18:27.600
You can see his face is also smudged.

4384
03:18:27.600 --> 03:18:29.440
He's got a little bit of a tickle of whisker

4385
03:18:29.440 --> 03:18:31.020
across the bottom of the chin.

4386
03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:33.170
Short, dark hair.

4387
03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:37.402
Kind of ruddy-textured skin.

4388
03:18:38.460 --> 03:18:40.120
Couple of burn marks on the edge of his hands,

4389
03:18:40.120 --> 03:18:41.720
looks like he's probably done some hard work in his time.

4390
03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:43.820
He's laughing and he's telling a story

4391
03:18:43.820 --> 03:18:45.760
around a couple other friends.

4392
03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:47.180
SAM: Elf or dwarf?
MATT: He is elf.

4393
03:18:47.180 --> 03:18:50.000
SAM: Elf, I'll go over to him and.

4394
03:18:51.045 --> 03:18:55.600
Hello, stranger, can I, can I contribute

4395
03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:58.150
to the delinquency of you miners?

4396
03:18:58.150 --> 03:19:03.117
[laughter]

4397
03:19:06.810 --> 03:19:08.550
MATT: The whole table stops talking and laughing

4398
03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:10.650
and turns and looks at you.

4399
03:19:10.650 --> 03:19:12.770
SAM: I mean, can I buy you a drink?

4400
03:19:15.720 --> 03:19:16.553
MATT: "By all means."

4401
03:19:17.680 --> 03:19:20.580
SAM: A round of whatever they're having over here, please.

4402
03:19:20.580 --> 03:19:22.040
Hi.
MATT: One of the barhands

4403
03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:24.280
comes by, it will cost you, for everyone at the table,

4404
03:19:24.280 --> 03:19:27.710
it should be six people, ale,

4405
03:19:27.710 --> 03:19:31.690
that'll put you back about three silver pieces.

4406
03:19:31.690 --> 03:19:34.314
SAM: I'll give them three silver.

4407
03:19:34.314 --> 03:19:35.540
[laughter]

4408
03:19:35.540 --> 03:19:38.835
MATT: The barhand goes, "Oh, exact change, great."

4409
03:19:38.835 --> 03:19:42.190
[laughter]

4410
03:19:42.190 --> 03:19:43.490
The elf looks to you, goes,

4411
03:19:44.610 --> 03:19:46.560
"Thank you very much for your patronage."

4412
03:19:47.460 --> 03:19:50.060
SAM: Ah, we're just new, me and my friends are new to town

4413
03:19:50.060 --> 03:19:53.300
and we were wondering if any of you lot

4414
03:19:53.300 --> 03:19:57.110
could maybe give us some tidbits

4415
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:59.299
about your fine village here, your town,

4416
03:19:59.299 --> 03:20:02.720
your city center, your capitol--

4417
03:20:02.720 --> 03:20:05.510
MATT: "You're saying you're not from around here, goblin."

4418
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:07.730
SAM: No.
MATT: "Funny.

4419
03:20:07.730 --> 03:20:08.740
"I wouldn't have guessed.

4420
03:20:08.740 --> 03:20:10.829
"Yeah, that's fine.

4421
03:20:10.829 --> 03:20:12.150
"For the round of drinks, I'll tell you.

4422
03:20:12.150 --> 03:20:15.990
"Welcome to Uthodurn.

4423
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:18.930
"The central road here is the Auger Trail.

4424
03:20:18.930 --> 03:20:20.460
"It wraps around multiple times.

4425
03:20:20.460 --> 03:20:22.890
"On the way down, there are three discs.

4426
03:20:22.890 --> 03:20:25.140
"There's a Volition Disc, which you're currently in."

4427
03:20:25.140 --> 03:20:26.890
SAM: Bolition?
MATT: "The Volition Disc."

4428
03:20:26.890 --> 03:20:27.723
SAM: Volition Disc?

4429
03:20:28.870 --> 03:20:30.060
MATT: "That's the top level.

4430
03:20:30.060 --> 03:20:32.370
"It's the oldest of the regions.

4431
03:20:32.370 --> 03:20:35.163
"Houses most of the citizens.

4432
03:20:37.460 --> 03:20:39.590
"Following that downward, you come to the secondary

03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:41.260
"which is called the Deliberation Disc

4434
03:20:41.260 --> 03:20:44.290
"or the Liber Disc for short.

4435
03:20:44.290 --> 03:20:46.510
"That's divided by a series of wide pillars

4439
03:20:56.140 --> 03:20:58.790
"Heading past down the Deliberation Disc, there's,"

4440
03:21:01.450 --> 03:21:05.470
looking in my notes, "the Grand Disc.

4441

03:21:19.390 --> 03:21:23.330
"That's where most of our town is, you know,

4448
03:21:23.330 --> 03:21:27.680
"lawfully taken care of, I guess you'd say.

4449
03:21:27.680 --> 03:21:30.553
"Looks like a frozen tornado, it's crazy."

4450
03:21:31.570 --> 03:21:32.740
SAM: Wow.

4451
03:21:32.740 --> 03:21:36.420
You are amazing, thank you so much for that information.

4452
03:21:36.420 --> 03:21:38.680
We're looking for a fellow named--

4453
03:21:38.680 --> 03:21:42.740
LAURA: Dulgrim Smeltborne.
SAM: Dulgrim Smeltborne.

4454
03:21:42.740 --> 03:21:46.100
MATT: "Smeltborne, Smeltborne, that's a smithy, right?"

4455
03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:48.087
SAM: Yes.
MATT: "Smithy, right?

4456
03:21:48.087 --> 03:21:49.090
"If I recall, that's probably,

4457
03:21:49.090 --> 03:21:50.690
"that's in the Deliberation Disc.

4458
03:21:51.980 --> 03:21:53.400
"Can't recall where exactly.

4459
03:21:53.400 --> 03:21:55.440
"I haven't been there myself but I've heard about it,

4460
03:21:55.440 --> 03:21:56.980
"so you can go ahead and look.

4461
03:21:56.980 --> 03:21:58.975
"It's a little ways further down.

4462
03:21:58.975 --> 03:22:01.210
"Maybe about hour, hour-and-a-half walk."

4463
03:22:01.210 --> 03:22:04.240
TALIESIN: Just for giggles, is he telling the truth?

4464
03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:06.862
MATT: Make an insight check.
TALIESIN: Cool.

4465
03:22:08.270 --> 03:22:10.580
21.
MATT: 21.

4466
03:22:10.580 --> 03:22:14.740
SAM: Whispers.
[cheering]

4467
03:22:15.770 --> 03:22:19.080
Guys, the D&amp;D Beyond Presidential Campaign

4468
03:22:19.080 --> 03:22:20.670
has come to an end.

4469
03:22:20.670 --> 03:22:25.270
I can't wait to claim victory.
[laughter]

4470
03:22:25.270 --> 03:22:27.312
TALIESIN: I take out my dagger and now, just kidding, okay.

4471
03:22:27.312 --> 03:22:28.145
MATT: (laughs)

4472
03:22:28.145 --> 03:22:30.711
TALIESIN: (stabbing)
MATT: (grunting)

4473
03:22:30.711 --> 03:22:33.690
TRAVIS: Can we all see who Nott is talking to?

4474
03:22:33.690 --> 03:22:35.720
MATT: Yeah, and you can see across the table.

4475
03:22:35.720 --> 03:22:38.103
You notice this, too.

4476
03:22:38.103 --> 03:22:40.630
They seem charmed with this little goblin

4477
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:41.790
that came up and bought them drinks

4478
03:22:41.790 --> 03:22:43.480
and is asking about the town and

4479
03:22:45.510 --> 03:22:47.610
you get the sense that maybe goblins

4480
03:22:47.610 --> 03:22:50.190
aren't very prominent up north.

4481
03:22:50.190 --> 03:22:53.170
There's less of an immediate judgment here.

4482
03:22:53.170 --> 03:22:54.790
SAM: I like it.

4483
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:56.090
Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah?

4484
03:22:56.090 --> 03:22:58.750
SAM: I did what you always do, I just

4485
03:22:58.750 --> 03:23:00.340
went and told the truth and was nice

4486
03:23:00.340 --> 03:23:01.650
and they were nice to me.

4487
03:23:01.650 --> 03:23:03.860
TALIESIN: That was very impressive, I actually was watching

4488
03:23:03.860 --> 03:23:05.980
all of that, that was really good.

4489
03:23:05.980 --> 03:23:08.040
SAM: Yeah, it felt good.

4490
03:23:08.040 --> 03:23:11.079
They didn't throw anything at me and--

4491
03:23:11.079 --> 03:23:13.530
[awwing]
And, I think,

4492
03:23:13.530 --> 03:23:15.000
if I play my cards right,

4493
03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:17.230
I might be able to steal from them later.

4494
03:23:17.230 --> 03:23:20.230
[laughter]

4495
03:23:22.140 --> 03:23:24.540
TALIESIN: I'll make you a deal.

4496
03:23:24.540 --> 03:23:26.560
If we don't steal from the first people

4497
03:23:26.560 --> 03:23:29.280
that we meet down here, I'll definitely

4498
03:23:29.280 --> 03:23:32.549
not be mad about you nearly blowing me up again.

4499
03:23:32.549 --> 03:23:34.997
[gasping]
SAM: Okay.

4500
03:23:34.997 --> 03:23:36.510
MATT: (laughs)

4501
03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:38.701
TALIESIN: Does the wink mean yes okay,

4502
03:23:38.701 --> 03:23:39.967
or does the wink mean no?

4503
03:23:39.967 --> 03:23:42.030
SAM: Sure.

4504
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:43.130
TALIESIN: Just the--

4505
03:23:43.130 --> 03:23:45.860
you're really hard to read, you know that?

4506
03:23:45.860 --> 03:23:47.952
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

4507
03:23:50.932 --> 03:23:52.900
LAURA: What time of day is it?

4508
03:23:52.900 --> 03:23:55.870
MATT: At this point, it's probably just sunset.

4509
03:23:55.870 --> 03:23:59.677
LIAM: It is exactly sunset.

4510
03:23:59.677 --> 03:24:00.900
LAURA: Oh, okay.

4511
03:24:00.900 --> 03:24:03.050
MATT: So pushing 8:00 in the evening.

4512
03:24:03.050 --> 03:24:05.426
There's still a whole night ahead of you.

4513
03:24:05.426 --> 03:24:07.010
LAURA: So Dulgrim is like four centuries old,

4514
03:24:07.010 --> 03:24:09.993
so he probably was in bed like five hours ago.

4515
03:24:09.993 --> 03:24:12.576
(laughter)

4516
03:24:14.813 --> 03:24:16.400
SAM: Maybe he's watching his stories?

4517
03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:19.609
LAURA: Maybe.
[laughter]

4518
03:24:19.609 --> 03:24:20.620
TRAVIS: "Watching his stories."

4519
03:24:21.580 --> 03:24:24.610
LIAM: Why don't we plant ourselves here for the night

4520
03:24:24.610 --> 03:24:26.450
and go over at a decent hour in the morning?

4521
03:24:26.450 --> 03:24:28.540
SAM: That sounds good.
LAURA: I like it.

4522
03:24:28.540 --> 03:24:29.550
MATT: Okay.

4523
03:24:29.550 --> 03:24:30.790
You guys settle up for the evening.

4524
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:32.520
Your rooms are adequate.

4525
03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:34.760
It's not extremely comfortable,

4526
03:24:34.760 --> 03:24:37.200
especially not Lavish Chateau level,

4527
03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:40.510
but you have a bed, you have door that locks,

4528
03:24:40.510 --> 03:24:43.168
you have a chair and a table.

4529
03:24:43.168 --> 03:24:47.243
Both rooms contain these things and that's it.

4530
03:24:47.243 --> 03:24:50.270
LIAM: Before everyone goes to bed tonight,

4531
03:24:50.270 --> 03:24:51.730
Jester.
LAURA: Hm?

4532
03:24:51.730 --> 03:24:56.050
LIAM: Do you have the ability to send any messages?

4533
03:24:56.050 --> 03:24:56.883
LAURA: Yes.

4534
03:24:59.112 --> 03:25:02.467
LIAM: That music is lovely.

4535
03:25:02.467 --> 03:25:06.260
Would you do me a favor and contact Essek

4536
03:25:06.260 --> 03:25:11.260
and see what our, what their timeline is for the,

4537
03:25:12.186 --> 03:25:13.540
the Vollstrecker.

4538
03:25:13.540 --> 03:25:16.880
LAURA: The what?
LIAM: The Scourger

4539
03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:17.940
in their prison that they have.

4540
03:25:17.940 --> 03:25:22.400
LAURA: Yes, yes, like how long they plan--

4541
03:25:22.400 --> 03:25:25.000
LIAM: If they can still hold a while longer.

4542
03:25:27.060 --> 03:25:29.040
I would like them to hold a while longer if they can.

4543
03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:32.240
LAURA: Yes, I will definitely do that.

4544
03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:33.860
I am going to send a message.

4545
03:25:35.472 --> 03:25:38.200
[laughter]

4546
03:25:38.200 --> 03:25:39.033
To Essek.

4547
03:25:43.430 --> 03:25:46.200
Hi!

4548
03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:48.800
Here with Caleb.

4549
03:25:48.800 --> 03:25:53.763
Just wondering, can you

4550
03:25:54.610 --> 03:25:57.993
keep that Scourger alive a while longer, please?

4551
03:25:59.361 --> 03:26:02.840
[laughter]

4552
03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:07.000
He wants it kept alive for a while longer, please.

4553
03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:12.900
What do you think?

4554
03:26:12.900 --> 03:26:15.379
I don't know how much time.

4555
03:26:15.379 --> 03:26:18.686
MATT: As you trail off, Essek eventually responds.

4556
03:26:18.686 --> 03:26:22.461
"(laughs) Jester.

4557
03:26:22.461 --> 03:26:27.030
"I will do what I can, but my power is still limited

4558
03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:29.010
"against that of the Dynasty.

4559
03:26:31.820 --> 03:26:35.500
"House Kryn, the den has no interest

4560
03:26:35.500 --> 03:26:37.720
"in keeping the prisoner alive much longer.

4561
03:26:38.830 --> 03:26:40.688
"I shall try."

4562
03:26:44.106 --> 03:26:47.670
LIAM: Yes, no?
LAURA: Well, he said

4563
03:26:47.670 --> 03:26:50.870
that it is going to be hard for him

4564
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:52.110
because they don't really care

4565
03:26:52.110 --> 03:26:55.380
and they want to kill the Scourger,

4566
03:26:55.380 --> 03:26:58.470
but he's going to try real hard to keep

4567
03:26:58.470 --> 03:27:01.760
the Scourger alive a while longer.

4568
03:27:01.760 --> 03:27:03.220
But it's not really up to him.

4569
03:27:03.220 --> 03:27:06.480
LIAM: Do you have one more in you?

4570
03:27:06.480 --> 03:27:08.288
LAURA: <i>Ja.</i>

4571
03:27:10.810 --> 03:27:15.683
LIAM: Could you tell him that while the chances are slim,

4572
03:27:17.770 --> 03:27:19.820
there is a chance because of my history

4573
03:27:19.820 --> 03:27:24.760
I could maybe learn something that would help them.

4574
03:27:27.580 --> 03:27:29.170
LAURA: Yes.

4575
03:27:29.170 --> 03:27:33.198
I definitely can do that in 25 words.

4576
03:27:33.198 --> 03:27:34.800
I've just got to think for a minute

4577
03:27:34.800 --> 03:27:37.250
about how I'm going to phrase it.

4578
03:27:38.110 --> 03:27:40.062
Because of your history,

4579
03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:43.070
you think you could learn something about yourself

4580
03:27:43.070 --> 03:27:45.280
from the Scourger.

4581
03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:46.113
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

4582
03:27:47.010 --> 03:27:48.213
LAURA: Okay.

4583
03:27:48.213 --> 03:27:50.643
I'm going to send a message to Essek.

4584
03:27:53.020 --> 03:27:56.770
Caleb thinks that because of his history,

4585
03:27:56.770 --> 03:27:58.920
he may be able to learn something about

4586
03:27:58.920 --> 03:28:03.908
himself that would help you guys if it's alive.

4587
03:28:06.730 --> 03:28:09.850
You pooping?
[laughter]

4588
03:28:15.291 --> 03:28:17.850
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4589
03:28:17.850 --> 03:28:19.508
MATT: Sadly, I do not think

4590
03:28:19.508 --> 03:28:22.840
the last bit made its way through.

4591
03:28:22.840 --> 03:28:24.907
But Essek responds.

4592
03:28:25.980 --> 03:28:28.410
"I will do my best.

4593
03:28:28.410 --> 03:28:31.750
"I make no promises but will

4594
03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:35.210
"implore the mercy."
(farting)

4595
03:28:37.360 --> 03:28:40.780
"Excuse me.
[laughter]

4596
03:28:51.015 --> 03:28:53.043
"I had to drop a dunamis."

4597
03:28:53.043 --> 03:28:55.820
(laughter)
SAM: Oh, no.

4598
03:28:58.140 --> 03:29:00.838
MATT: No, but--
LAURA: (laughs)

4599
03:29:00.838 --> 03:29:02.588
"I will do my best, but no promises."

4600
03:29:05.900 --> 03:29:07.840
LAURA: He said he's going to try real hard.

4601
03:29:07.840 --> 03:29:11.090
He's going to do his best, but he doesn't know

4602
03:29:11.090 --> 03:29:13.760
if they'll listen to him, but he's going to try real hard,

4603
03:29:13.760 --> 03:29:15.657
he just can't make any promises.

4604
03:29:15.657 --> 03:29:17.046
LIAM: Okay.

4605
03:29:17.046 --> 03:29:20.056
Why did you ask if he was pooping?

4606
03:29:20.056 --> 03:29:23.180
[laughter]

4607
03:29:23.180 --> 03:29:26.050
LAURA: I just thought, you know,

4608
03:29:26.050 --> 03:29:27.520
because you guys said that sometimes

4609
03:29:27.520 --> 03:29:30.191
I may be interrupting people or something.

4610
03:29:30.191 --> 03:29:31.940
[laughter]

4611
03:29:31.940 --> 03:29:36.940
When I'm casting my spell and so, you know.

4612
03:29:37.694 --> 03:29:39.470
I don't know, maybe

4613
03:29:41.308 --> 03:29:44.870
he didn't want to be bothered or something.

4614
03:29:44.870 --> 03:29:46.560
Although, I think, you know,

4615
03:29:46.560 --> 03:29:49.271
if you were pooping, that's the best time to send a message.

4616
03:29:49.271 --> 03:29:52.271
[laughter]

4617
03:29:54.250 --> 03:29:57.885
Because what else are you going to do, you know?

4618
03:29:59.490 --> 03:30:02.560
LIAM: I, I think you are correct.

4619
03:30:02.560 --> 03:30:05.220
It is the best time to send the message,

4620
03:30:06.840 --> 03:30:10.678
but maybe not the best time to receive a message.

4621
03:30:12.060 --> 03:30:13.561
LAURA: Oh.

4622
03:30:13.561 --> 03:30:16.030
SAM: Do you think he floats over the seat

4623
03:30:16.030 --> 03:30:17.951
so he doesn't have to put down?

4624
03:30:17.951 --> 03:30:20.850
[laughter]
[applause]

4625
03:30:20.850 --> 03:30:23.520
You know, one of those things?

4626
03:30:25.960 --> 03:30:28.410
It's very sanitary.

4627
03:30:28.410 --> 03:30:30.570
LIAM: Listen, I have read a lot

4628
03:30:30.570 --> 03:30:34.293
and those Kryn toilets are amazing.

4629
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:42.870
MATT: Is there anything else you wish to accomplish

4630
03:30:42.870 --> 03:30:44.670
before bedding down for the evening?

4631
03:30:46.920 --> 03:30:49.398
LIAM: Thank you, thank you, Jester.

4632
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:53.430
MATT: All right, you guys head to your rooms--

4633
03:30:53.430 --> 03:30:56.110
SAM: Bed down for the night?
MARISHA: I guess so.

4634
03:30:56.110 --> 03:30:56.943
MATT: Okay.

4635
03:30:57.820 --> 03:31:00.760
A nice evening's rest amongst rooms that are passable,

4636
03:31:00.760 --> 03:31:03.310
but an evening without worry.

4637
03:31:03.310 --> 03:31:06.310
Door's still securely locked and I assume,

4638
03:31:06.310 --> 03:31:09.280
Caleb, doing his general evening rigmarole.

4639
03:31:09.280 --> 03:31:11.747
LIAM: Every night, every night.
MATT: Yep.

4640
03:31:13.250 --> 03:31:14.840
Morning comes to you, at least,

4641
03:31:14.840 --> 03:31:16.140
you acknowledge it's morning.

4642
03:31:16.140 --> 03:31:17.970
Once again, another day awakening

4643
03:31:17.970 --> 03:31:20.400
within a subterranean cavern.

4644
03:31:20.400 --> 03:31:22.470
Sunlight mornings have been a very spotty thing

4645
03:31:22.470 --> 03:31:24.420
in recent adventures and travels for you guys

4646
03:31:24.420 --> 03:31:26.360
but you come to consciousness.

4647
03:31:26.360 --> 03:31:28.760
You come to a breakfast that is included

4648
03:31:28.760 --> 03:31:31.010
as part of the evening.

4649
03:31:31.010 --> 03:31:34.843
It is hearty, is made of

4650
03:31:34.843 --> 03:31:36.760
no fancy fruits

4651
03:31:36.760 --> 03:31:41.362
and, you know, tropical Menagerie Coast elements

4652
03:31:41.362 --> 03:31:45.530
of a breakfast dish. It is mainly meats

4653
03:31:45.530 --> 03:31:49.510
and hearty roots, potatoes,

4654
03:31:49.510 --> 03:31:51.410
with a little bit of garnish of green,

4655
03:31:51.410 --> 03:31:54.370
you're not quite sure where it came from.

4656
03:31:54.370 --> 03:31:56.580
LIAM: I'm into it.
SAM: Yeah.

4657
03:31:56.580 --> 03:31:58.430
MARISHA: Caduceus, what is this green thing?

4658
03:32:00.040 --> 03:32:01.060
Is it a fungus?

4659
03:32:01.060 --> 03:32:03.780
It's a fungus, isn't it?

4660
03:32:03.780 --> 03:32:05.456
TALIESIN: Is it a fungus?
MATT: Make a nature check.

4661
03:32:05.456 --> 03:32:07.310
TALIESIN: All right.

4662
03:32:07.310 --> 03:32:10.510
MTT: Make a nature check to assess breakfast.

4663
03:32:10.510 --> 03:32:11.580
[laughter]

4664
03:32:11.580 --> 03:32:14.155
TALIESIN: I mean, 17.

4665
03:32:14.155 --> 03:32:16.810
MATT: 17, it's fungus.

4666
03:32:16.810 --> 03:32:19.690
TALIESIN: No, yeah, no, yeah, it is.

4667
03:32:19.690 --> 03:32:21.715
MARISHA: You eat it first.

4668
03:32:22.600 --> 03:32:23.590
Is it good?

4669
03:32:23.590 --> 03:32:26.560
TALIESIN: It's garnish, isn't it?
MATT: Maybe.

4670
03:32:28.290 --> 03:32:30.060
TALIESIN: It's all right.
MATT: But it's not bad.

4671
03:32:30.060 --> 03:32:31.640
TALIESIN: It's pretty good.

4672
03:32:31.640 --> 03:32:34.780
LIAM: Give it to Caduceus, he'll try anything.

4673
03:32:36.330 --> 03:32:37.950
LAURA: Caduceus, do you want my garnish

4674
03:32:37.950 --> 03:32:40.180
because I know you aren't going to eat your meat.

4675
03:32:40.180 --> 03:32:42.593
I don't want you to go hungry.
TALIESIN: Free garnish, all right.

4676
03:32:42.593 --> 03:32:47.180
I nibble.
[laughter]

4677
03:32:47.180 --> 03:32:48.600
MATT: Caduceus, the garnish hoarder.

4678
03:32:48.600 --> 03:32:50.670
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4679
03:32:50.670 --> 03:32:52.940
Somebody got to eat the parsley, man.

4680
03:32:52.940 --> 03:32:54.170
MATT: There's a couple of plates left out

4681
03:32:54.170 --> 03:32:55.410
from folks that have finished their breakfast,

4682
03:32:55.410 --> 03:32:57.440
the garnish still left on the side.

4683
03:32:57.440 --> 03:33:01.377
You're picking up the dead soldiers of other people's meals.

4684
03:33:04.423 --> 03:33:07.150
SAM: All right, so we'll go see,

4685
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:10.220
go down and see the guy?

4686
03:33:10.220 --> 03:33:11.400
LAURA: Dulgrim.
TRAVIS: Head down

4687
03:33:11.400 --> 03:33:12.780
to the Deliberation Disc.

4688
03:33:12.780 --> 03:33:15.560
LAURA: Is it the deliberation or the liberation?

4689
03:33:15.560 --> 03:33:16.970
MATT: No, Deliberation Disc

4690
03:33:16.970 --> 03:33:19.140
is what it's called, but you heard it referred to

4691
03:33:19.140 --> 03:33:21.160
as the Liber Disc.
MARISHA: What's the one

4692
03:33:21.160 --> 03:33:22.980
that we're on called?

4693
03:33:22.980 --> 03:33:24.720
SAM: We're on Volition.

4694
03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:26.410
MARISHA: Volition?
MATT: You're in the Volition Disc

4695
03:33:26.410 --> 03:33:29.426
which is the top, then there's the Deliberation Disc,

4696
03:33:29.426 --> 03:33:31.987
then there's the--

4697
03:33:31.987 --> 03:33:35.010
SAM: Can we find the elevator down?

4698
03:33:35.010 --> 03:33:36.390
The stairs down?
MATT: There we go, the Grand Disc.

4699
03:33:36.390 --> 03:33:39.160
SAM: Is it the same spiral staircase down?

4700
03:33:39.160 --> 03:33:40.740
MATT: No, actually, the spiral staircase

4701
03:33:40.740 --> 03:33:42.000
was only the entrance to the city.

4702
03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:46.080
The rest of it is just one, wide, spiraling cavern,

4703
03:33:46.080 --> 03:33:48.320
like a corkscrew that goes deeper and deeper.

4704
03:33:48.320 --> 03:33:50.901
TRAVIS: Down and through we go.
SAM: All right, let's go.

4705
03:33:50.901 --> 03:33:54.130
MATT: All right, continuing past the city,

4706
03:33:54.130 --> 03:33:57.750
now bustling in the morning, it's crowded.

4707
03:33:57.750 --> 03:34:00.340
The evening was not quite as much,

4708
03:34:00.340 --> 03:34:02.260
maybe it's just the culture has grown over time,

4709
03:34:02.260 --> 03:34:06.467
it's the combination of the two, but

4710
03:34:06.467 --> 03:34:09.770
I wouldn't say overpopulated, but it's a very crowded city.

4711
03:34:09.770 --> 03:34:11.480
As people are moving through and pushing past,

4712
03:34:11.480 --> 03:34:12.600
they're going off to business,

4713
03:34:12.600 --> 03:34:16.550
they're going off to various work appointments,

4714
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:20.000
they're going to get ready for their shift,

4715
03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:21.850
looking at the outskirts of the city.

4716
03:34:21.850 --> 03:34:23.070
Some of them are just taking their kids

4717
03:34:23.070 --> 03:34:24.420
who are screaming through the streets

4718
03:34:24.420 --> 03:34:26.670
to try and get them fed.

4719
03:34:26.670 --> 03:34:28.840
It's fairly bustling at this hour.

4720
03:34:28.840 --> 03:34:31.650
As you push through, also, you can see the various,

4721
03:34:31.650 --> 03:34:34.310
the pillars, you can begin to see the metal gates

4722
03:34:34.310 --> 03:34:37.200
that connotate the end of the Volition Disc.

4723
03:34:37.200 --> 03:34:39.670
There are the pillars that hold up

4724
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:42.880
the central parts of the cavern every hundred or so feet.

4725
03:34:42.880 --> 03:34:46.330
These now hold aloft these thick, metal,

4726
03:34:46.330 --> 03:34:48.420
like dark, dark metal gates

4727
03:34:48.420 --> 03:34:50.790
that look ready to drop at any given point in time.

4728
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:53.960
They're partially embedded in the ceiling above it.

4729
03:34:53.960 --> 03:34:55.480
You can see now, this place is designed

4730
03:34:55.480 --> 03:34:57.870
to essentially lock itself down

4731
03:34:57.870 --> 03:34:59.230
from various defense positions

4732
03:34:59.230 --> 03:35:02.879
should it be attacked from one or the other direction.

4733
03:35:02.879 --> 03:35:04.720
The pillars that are not affixed to these gates

4734
03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:07.060
within and beyond that, you can see up to the top,

4735
03:35:07.060 --> 03:35:09.990
there are homes, largely of elven design

4736
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:12.060
that are built at different heights along it.

4737
03:35:12.060 --> 03:35:13.610
It looks like they're starting to make use

4738
03:35:13.610 --> 03:35:16.000
of whatever space they can to give more housing.

4739
03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:18.880
It's a very unique, patchwork cluster of

4740
03:35:18.880 --> 03:35:20.990
different aspects of your own world experience

4741
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:22.470
with both cultures all jammed into

4742
03:35:22.470 --> 03:35:26.200
this weird, beautiful tapestry.

4743
03:35:26.200 --> 03:35:28.370
Continuing past the metal gates

4744
03:35:28.370 --> 03:35:30.710
deeper into the Deliberation Disc,

4745
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:34.857
you do, if I have my notes here,

4746
03:35:35.970 --> 03:35:38.197
you can see

4747
03:35:38.197 --> 03:35:41.220
floor to ceiling with homes and emporiums.

4748
03:35:41.220 --> 03:35:45.650
This place is the bustling market center of the city.

4749
03:35:45.650 --> 03:35:48.000
There are all manner of shops and carts

4750
03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:49.560
and the smell of different foods

4751
03:35:49.560 --> 03:35:52.430
being cooked and dried and smoked

4752
03:35:52.430 --> 03:35:53.800
all throughout the main street.

4753
03:35:53.800 --> 03:35:56.370
There are barkers and people just shouting out

4754
03:35:56.370 --> 03:35:58.390
to get your attention and the attention of those going by,

4755
03:35:58.390 --> 03:35:59.950
most folks just push through.

4756
03:35:59.950 --> 03:36:00.783
They're not paying attention

4757
03:36:00.783 --> 03:36:03.710
unless their business is to go there.

4758
03:36:04.840 --> 03:36:07.873
Who's keeping an eye out for your destination?

4759
03:36:09.030 --> 03:36:11.700
All right, go ahead and make a perception check.

4760
03:36:13.380 --> 03:36:15.080
TALIESIN: 21.

4761
03:36:15.080 --> 03:36:15.913
MATT: 21.

4762
03:36:15.913 --> 03:36:17.440
As you guys glance through, you, thankfully,

4763
03:36:17.440 --> 03:36:19.586
are probably one of the tallest if not the tallest--

4764
03:36:19.586 --> 03:36:21.260
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.
MATT: -- person in this city

4765
03:36:21.260 --> 03:36:23.030
at this moment.

4766
03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:24.980
Glancing above the crowd,

4767
03:36:24.980 --> 03:36:28.905
you do see a massive temple

4768
03:36:28.905 --> 03:36:30.710
that holds the symbol of Moradin,

4769
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:32.680
which is the dual-sided warhammer

4770
03:36:32.680 --> 03:36:34.290
with a dwarven face on each end.

4771
03:36:34.290 --> 03:36:36.620
You can see as it rises up to this pinnacle

4772
03:36:36.620 --> 03:36:38.490
and there, this anvil sits on top

4773
03:36:38.490 --> 03:36:40.920
where that emblem is emblazoned across it.

4774
03:36:40.920 --> 03:36:43.920
Just beyond that, you see a sign that you swear says

4775
03:36:43.920 --> 03:36:47.120
Smeltborne that is dangling from the outside

4776
03:36:47.120 --> 03:36:50.200
of some sort of a heavy, stone building

4777
03:36:50.200 --> 03:36:53.567
glowing from the inside of the open door.

4778
03:36:53.567 --> 03:36:55.430
TALIESIN: I think that way.

4779
03:36:55.430 --> 03:36:57.840
SAM: Great.
TALIESIN: Yep, yep, that's, yep.

4780
03:36:57.840 --> 03:37:01.842
Yeah, wait, yeah.

4781
03:37:01.842 --> 03:37:03.670
MARISHA: I look behind us, are we being followed?

4782
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:05.151
Or I look around.
MATT: Make a perception check.

4783
03:37:05.151 --> 03:37:08.950
LAURA: I look for a bakery.

4784
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:10.530
MATT: Make a perception check (laughs).

4785
03:37:10.530 --> 03:37:12.370
TALIESIN: I also want to--
MATT: Both important rolls.

4786
03:37:12.370 --> 03:37:15.800
MARISHA: Natural one.
LIAM: Give us a 20!

4787
03:37:15.800 --> 03:37:16.900
LAURA: No, that would've been amazing.

4788
03:37:16.900 --> 03:37:20.414
TALIESIN: I also would like to--
LAURA: 11.

4789
03:37:20.414 --> 03:37:23.930
MATT: You also would like to--?
TALIESIN: Check for pockets

4790
03:37:23.930 --> 03:37:26.060
to make sure we haven't been pickpocketed.

4791
03:37:26.060 --> 03:37:27.926
I've been to town before.
MATT: Okay.

4792
03:37:27.926 --> 03:37:29.879
[laughter]

4793
03:37:29.879 --> 03:37:32.970
No pockets picked.

4794
03:37:32.970 --> 03:37:35.360
No sign of being followed.

4795
03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:37.531
And, yeah, there's a bakery.

4796
03:37:37.531 --> 03:37:40.760
(laughs)

4797
03:37:40.760 --> 03:37:44.630
You come up to what's called The Softer Stone Forge,

4798
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:47.930
is the name of the bakery.
LAURA: That's so cute.

4799
03:37:47.930 --> 03:37:51.980
MATT: It looks really like pretty rough-hewn

4800
03:37:51.980 --> 03:37:55.195
on the outside, it doesn't have any sort of color

4801
03:37:55.195 --> 03:37:57.520
that would present itself as a bakery

4802
03:37:57.520 --> 03:38:00.420
beyond just the title, but you can recognize the smell.

4803
03:38:00.420 --> 03:38:02.120
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: You recognize it immediately

4804
03:38:02.120 --> 03:38:04.110
and as you approach, the door, which

4805
03:38:04.110 --> 03:38:05.820
as opposed to a door that opens and closes,

4806
03:38:05.820 --> 03:38:07.540
it's like a saloon that pushes open

4807
03:38:07.540 --> 03:38:09.240
and then flaps back.
LAURA: (whooshes)

4808
03:38:09.240 --> 03:38:10.830
MATT: As you push through, on the inside,

4809
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:13.770
you can see a baking kiln

4810
03:38:13.770 --> 03:38:15.880
and sheets and sheets of rough iron

4811
03:38:15.880 --> 03:38:18.870
that contain these risen dough pods

4812
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:21.966
and cupcakes that are in the process of being frosted.

4813
03:38:21.966 --> 03:38:23.090
[laughter]

4814
03:38:23.090 --> 03:38:26.250
LAURA: Dough pods!

4815
03:38:26.250 --> 03:38:29.030
MATT: You can see a young elven girl with

4816
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:32.120
a short, combed over, quaffed to one side,

4817
03:38:32.120 --> 03:38:34.260
look up to you, her face, a little bit of frosting

4818
03:38:34.260 --> 03:38:36.660
pushed on one cheek goes, "Can I help you?"

4819
03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:40.480
LAURA: Hello, beautiful.

4820
03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:42.870
I would very much like to try some of your

4821
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:45.936
wonderful baked goods here in

4822
03:38:45.936 --> 03:38:49.850
the fabulous city of Uthodurn.

4823
03:38:49.850 --> 03:38:51.680
MATT: "My what an entrance, certainly.

4824
03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:53.890
"How many would you like?"

4825
03:38:53.890 --> 03:38:56.730
LAURA: How many have you got?
MATT: "I've got plenty.

4826
03:38:56.730 --> 03:38:59.930
"We've got blue ones, flavored like blueberry.

4827
03:38:59.930 --> 03:39:04.610
"We've got black ones, flavored like black moss.

4828
03:39:04.610 --> 03:39:06.840
"We've got--"
LAURA: Black moss?

4829
03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:09.350
MATT: "Have you not had black moss cupcakes?

4830
03:39:09.350 --> 03:39:11.958
"Are you serious?"
LAURA: (tearfully) No!

4831
03:39:11.958 --> 03:39:12.791
MATT: "Well, I'm going to put about

4832
03:39:12.791 --> 03:39:14.160
"four or five into that one for you."

4833
03:39:14.160 --> 03:39:16.040
LAURA: Okay, okay.

4834
03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:17.410
And the blueberry, just like--

4835
03:39:17.410 --> 03:39:19.430
MATT: "And the blueberry."
LAURA: And what else?

4836
03:39:19.430 --> 03:39:21.120
MATT: "Okay, well, what do you like?

4837
03:39:21.120 --> 03:39:21.953
"Do you like more sweet--"

4838
03:39:21.953 --> 03:39:23.560
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: "Do you like more savory?"

4839
03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:25.690
LAURA: No.
MATT: "All sweet, okay.

4840
03:39:25.690 --> 03:39:28.445
"I'll give you this one and

4841
03:39:28.445 --> 03:39:29.550
"I'm going to do a baker's dozen mish mash.

4842
03:39:29.550 --> 03:39:32.920
"This is your first time, here you go.

4843
03:39:32.920 --> 03:39:37.880
"This'll put you back about four silver pieces."

4844
03:39:37.880 --> 03:39:39.210
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4845
03:39:39.210 --> 03:39:43.740
I give you five silver pieces.

4846
03:39:43.740 --> 03:39:45.130
MATT: "Thank you for your patronage."

4847
03:39:45.130 --> 03:39:47.220
LAURA: You're welcome.

4848
03:39:47.220 --> 03:39:49.790
I'm very excited, I immediately take out the black one

4849
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:51.072
and shove it in my mouth.

4850
03:39:51.072 --> 03:39:52.700
MATT: All right.

4851
03:39:52.700 --> 03:39:56.140
At first, it has a charcoal, earthy flavor

4852
03:39:56.140 --> 03:39:58.930
and you're immediately disappointed.

4853
03:39:58.930 --> 03:40:00.990
But then the cream filling kicks in

4854
03:40:00.990 --> 03:40:05.810
and the subtle after flavor has almost like a matcha,

4855
03:40:05.810 --> 03:40:08.380
green tea with a hint of sweet to it.

4856
03:40:08.380 --> 03:40:11.500
It's not super sweet, but it's very unique

4857
03:40:11.500 --> 03:40:12.930
and not bad by any means.

4858
03:40:12.930 --> 03:40:16.030
It wasn't what you were expecting, but not bad.

4859
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:20.016
LAURA: This was worth the entire trip.

4860
03:40:20.016 --> 03:40:22.201
[laughter]

4861
03:40:22.201 --> 03:40:27.109
[applause]

4862
03:40:31.800 --> 03:40:35.230
MATT: "Why, thank you very much for that."

4863
03:40:35.230 --> 03:40:36.820
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to see you tomorrow

4864
03:40:36.820 --> 03:40:38.590
and probably the next day and maybe--

4865
03:40:38.590 --> 03:40:39.860
MATT: "Any day, we'll be right here."

4866
03:40:39.860 --> 03:40:42.610
LAURA: Later on today, okay, bye.

4867
03:40:43.508 --> 03:40:45.360
(yelling) You guys!

4868
03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:47.900
MATT: Jester arrives.
LIAM: What do you have there?

4869
03:40:47.900 --> 03:40:49.360
LAURA: I have cupcakes,

4870
03:40:49.360 --> 03:40:50.590
there's this really good--
LIAM: A lot of them?

4871
03:40:50.590 --> 03:40:53.950
MATT: Well, how many do I have, 13 here, one, two, three,

4872
03:40:53.950 --> 03:40:56.310
four, five, six, so good,

4873
03:40:56.310 --> 03:40:58.614
that's one for each of you and the rest for me.

4874
03:40:58.614 --> 03:41:00.770
[laughter]

4875
03:41:00.770 --> 03:41:02.570
TRAVIS: They're so dark, are they burned?

4876
03:41:02.570 --> 03:41:04.640
LAURA: No, it's called black moss.

4877
03:41:04.640 --> 03:41:06.480
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: You should try it.

4878
03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:09.050
LIAM: I start to eat the blueberry one.

4879
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:10.640
LAURA: You are missing out.

4880
03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:12.870
You can get blueberry cupcakes anywhere.

4881
03:41:12.870 --> 03:41:15.630
TALIESIN: These are very good.
LIAM: Maybe so.

4882
03:41:15.630 --> 03:41:17.710
MARISHA: Caduceus, is it fungus?

4883
03:41:19.540 --> 03:41:22.873
TALIESIN: It's just very chewy.

4884
03:41:24.580 --> 03:41:25.890
LAURA: Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yes?

4885
03:41:25.890 --> 03:41:28.110
LAURA: Have a cupcake.

4886
03:41:28.110 --> 03:41:29.540
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: Yes, Fjord.

4887
03:41:29.540 --> 03:41:32.490
TRAVIS: No, I--
[laughter]

4888
03:41:32.490 --> 03:41:35.528
I'm not a fan of dark-looking sweet--

4889
03:41:35.528 --> 03:41:40.528
LAURA: (thumping)
[laughter]

4890
03:41:41.671 --> 03:41:43.062
TRAVIS: This is lovely.

4891
03:41:43.062 --> 03:41:44.540
LAURA: Are they good?
TRAVIS: (choking)

4892
03:41:44.540 --> 03:41:46.687
LAURA: No.

4893
03:41:46.687 --> 03:41:49.870
I will carefully close the box

4894
03:41:49.870 --> 03:41:51.980
and keep them very not shaken

4895
03:41:51.980 --> 03:41:55.750
and put them as carefully as I can into the Haversack

4896
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:58.100
so that the frosting doesn't get smushed around.

4897
03:41:58.100 --> 03:41:59.760
MATT: Okay, the box is too large to put in there

4898
03:41:59.760 --> 03:42:01.320
because the Haversack is a series of small pouches,

4899
03:42:01.320 --> 03:42:03.320
so you may have to put them in individually.

4900
03:42:03.320 --> 03:42:06.750
SAM: Or just eat them.

4901
03:42:06.750 --> 03:42:08.755
LAURA: I'm going to carry the box gingerly.

4902
03:42:08.755 --> 03:42:12.010
(laughter)

4903
03:42:12.010 --> 03:42:13.518
MATT: Fair enough.

4904
03:42:15.420 --> 03:42:17.320
TRAVIS: Shall we go on then?

4905
03:42:18.560 --> 03:42:19.610
LAURA: Yeah.

4906
03:42:19.610 --> 03:42:20.780
MATT: Okay, then.

4907
03:42:20.780 --> 03:42:22.420
You guys continue following Caduceus' lead.

4908
03:42:22.420 --> 03:42:25.540
You make your way towards the outskirts

4909
03:42:25.540 --> 03:42:27.930
of Moradin's Mantle,

4910
03:42:27.930 --> 03:42:29.140
that's the name of the temple.

4911
03:42:29.140 --> 03:42:30.970
On the inside, you can see there are numerous

4912
03:42:30.970 --> 03:42:35.970
reliefs and statues of the Allhamer, Moradin.

4913
03:42:36.690 --> 03:42:38.670
There are numerous crafts that are brought

4914
03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:40.940
and set upon there as part of the worship.

4915
03:42:40.940 --> 03:42:43.270
You can see the inside has almost like a miniature,

4916
03:42:43.270 --> 03:42:46.370
I want to say like a museum of various

4917
03:42:46.370 --> 03:42:50.780
things that meant a lot to the worshipers of Moradin.

4918
03:42:50.780 --> 03:42:53.680
Beyond that, as you pass by,

4919
03:42:53.680 --> 03:42:55.140
you see the specific location

4920
03:42:55.140 --> 03:42:56.770
that Caduceus has sussed out from a distance

4921
03:42:56.770 --> 03:42:59.020
and you can see the Smeltborne sign

4922
03:42:59.020 --> 03:43:01.290
saying the Anvil of Smeltborne

4923
03:43:01.290 --> 03:43:04.960
emblazoned on a wooden sign hanging from

4924
03:43:04.960 --> 03:43:07.350
a very nice,

4925
03:43:07.350 --> 03:43:10.380
well, well-made forge and blacksmithy.

4926
03:43:10.380 --> 03:43:13.200
TRAVIS: Seeing that temple, Caduceus, I'm rather new

4927
03:43:13.200 --> 03:43:16.360
to the whole deity thing, is it worth us going

4928
03:43:16.360 --> 03:43:19.750
and leaving something, some sort of offering

4929
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:22.340
as we pass through?

4930
03:43:22.340 --> 03:43:24.210
TALIESIN: I imagine it always is.

4931
03:43:24.210 --> 03:43:26.500
The question is what sort of offering

4932
03:43:26.500 --> 03:43:29.210
is appropriate to leave.

4933
03:43:29.210 --> 03:43:32.540
TRAVIS: To the Allhammer?
TALIESIN: To the Allhammer.

4934
03:43:33.390 --> 03:43:35.850
MARISHA: Do you have a hammer?

4935
03:43:35.850 --> 03:43:38.730
TRAVIS: I don't have shit.

4936
03:43:38.730 --> 03:43:39.960
MATT: Make a religion check if you'd like

4937
03:43:39.960 --> 03:43:41.670
to think of something.
TRAVIS: Sure.

4938
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:44.312
MATT: That might befit the Allhammer.

4939
03:43:44.312 --> 03:43:46.350
TRAVIS: Oh, 18.
MATT: 18.

4940
03:43:46.350 --> 03:43:51.350
The Allhammer really appreciates the process of creation,

4941
03:43:51.771 --> 03:43:56.180
whether that be crafting or making or forging or

4942
03:43:56.180 --> 03:44:01.180
whittling or building, the essence of a life

4943
03:44:02.240 --> 03:44:05.150
creating something outside of itself,

4944
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:09.300
beyond progeny of any kind, is, in itself,

4945
03:44:09.300 --> 03:44:11.780
an act of his joy and will.

4946
03:44:11.780 --> 03:44:14.930
So whatever you could make, big or small, generally,

4947
03:44:14.930 --> 03:44:17.163
is considered a good offering.

4948
03:44:18.190 --> 03:44:21.040
TRAVIS: Jester, was there anything you'd like to create

4949
03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:23.720
as an offering to the Allhammer as we pass through?

4950
03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:28.720
You do have-- oh.

4951
03:44:28.739 --> 03:44:30.880
MARISHA: You knew.

4952
03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:33.070
You knew.
TRAVIS: I forgot.

4953
03:44:33.070 --> 03:44:37.650
That's my, my fault, my fault.

4954
03:44:37.650 --> 03:44:39.680
LAURA: I'm going--
TRAVIS: Nope, mm-hm.

4955
03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:41.460
LAURA: What would you like me to make?

4956
03:44:42.430 --> 03:44:46.240
TRAVIS: Whatever you like!

4957
03:44:46.240 --> 03:44:48.380
LAURA: I'm going to paint on the ground

4958
03:44:48.380 --> 03:44:52.080
with my miraculous paint.
MATT: Okay.

4959
03:44:52.080 --> 03:44:54.690
LAURA: A stone hammer,

4960
03:44:56.190 --> 03:44:58.320
but it's going to be a hammer with a dick

4961
03:44:58.320 --> 03:45:02.933
and then the two--
(laughter)

4962
03:45:02.933 --> 03:45:04.638
MATT: Just waiting for it.

4963
03:45:05.580 --> 03:45:08.963
SAM: It's a ball peen hammer.

4964
03:45:08.963 --> 03:45:13.377
[cheering]

4965
03:45:13.377 --> 03:45:18.368
[cheering]

4966
03:45:20.970 --> 03:45:24.460
LAURA: I'm going to place it very gently in front of the--

4967
03:45:24.460 --> 03:45:27.980
MATT: All right, you can see this very, very old dwarf

4968
03:45:27.980 --> 03:45:31.020
with this long, thin beard and mustache

4969
03:45:31.020 --> 03:45:32.710
that curls down towards his belly

4970
03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:34.790
and it goes yellowed at the tips,

4971
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:36.770
completely bald on his head with liver spots

4972
03:45:36.770 --> 03:45:38.880
and his eyes have heavy wrinkles underneath,

4973
03:45:38.880 --> 03:45:41.360
robes on him, heavy chains around his neck.

4974
03:45:41.360 --> 03:45:44.280
He looks almost like a maester from "Game of Thrones,"

4975
03:45:44.280 --> 03:45:46.800
with a heavy anvil at the base of his thick chain necklace

4976
03:45:46.800 --> 03:45:50.310
and he goes, "Thank you so much, dear," and gives you a nod.

4977
03:45:50.310 --> 03:45:52.755
LAURA: Blessings be upon you, my child.

4978
03:45:52.755 --> 03:45:54.918
[laughter]

4979
03:45:54.918 --> 03:45:58.686
MATT: He looks down at it and goes, "Huh?"

4980
03:45:58.686 --> 03:46:02.548
As you walk away, you see him pick it up to inspect it.

4981
03:46:03.478 --> 03:46:05.070
All right.

4982
03:46:05.070 --> 03:46:06.360
You guys are at the outskirts

4983
03:46:06.360 --> 03:46:08.290
of the Anvil of the Smeltborne.

4984
03:46:08.290 --> 03:46:09.270
SAM: Let's go in.

4985
03:46:09.270 --> 03:46:11.630
Who has the sword that we're going to--

4986
03:46:11.630 --> 03:46:12.780
TALIESIN: I do.

4987
03:46:12.780 --> 03:46:14.170
SAM: You have the sword?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4988
03:46:14.170 --> 03:46:16.000
SAM: All right, whip that shit out, let's go.

4989
03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:20.360
TALIESIN: Well, let's, let's have a conversation first.

4990
03:46:20.360 --> 03:46:21.890
TRAVIS: Let's locate the man first, shall we?

4991
03:46:21.890 --> 03:46:22.950
LAURA: Let's have a conversation,

4992
03:46:22.950 --> 03:46:24.280
or let's have a conversation with him?

4993
03:46:24.280 --> 03:46:26.211
TALIESIN: With him.

4994
03:46:26.211 --> 03:46:29.130
LAURA: Okay, good, I don't want to talk to you guys anyway.

4995
03:46:29.130 --> 03:46:31.048
TRAVIS: Can we go up and approach the entrance?

4996
03:46:31.048 --> 03:46:32.680
SAM: Dulgrim!

4997
03:46:32.680 --> 03:46:34.050
TRAVIS: Maybe a little--
SAM: Dulgrim!

4998
03:46:34.050 --> 03:46:36.200
TRAVIS: Okay, whoa.

4999
03:46:36.200 --> 03:46:37.467
SAM: We're here.

5000
03:46:37.467 --> 03:46:38.350
MATT: All right, so as you're approaching the door,

5001
03:46:38.350 --> 03:46:40.430
the door which is partially open,

5002
03:46:40.430 --> 03:46:41.500
you can see the warm glow inside

5003
03:46:41.500 --> 03:46:43.390
and you can hear this hammering of metal, like,

5004
03:46:43.390 --> 03:46:46.484
ting, like that.
SAM: Oh, shit.

5005
03:46:46.484 --> 03:46:49.760
[laughter]
How did you do that?

5006
03:46:49.760 --> 03:46:53.043
MATT: Purely accidentally.
SAM: No.

5007
03:46:53.043 --> 03:46:54.140
You're a demon.
MATT: You're just

5008
03:46:54.140 --> 03:46:56.440
shouting Dulgrim?
TALIESIN: I'm going to,

5009
03:46:56.440 --> 03:46:58.520
to knock on the door and gently--

5010
03:46:58.520 --> 03:47:00.545
MATT: The hammering stops, you hear some footfalls

5011
03:47:00.545 --> 03:47:02.640
and the door opens and you see

5012
03:47:02.640 --> 03:47:06.780
a younger dwarf, sweaty,

5013
03:47:06.780 --> 03:47:10.640
his fine, long, blond hair

5014
03:47:10.640 --> 03:47:12.280
that's tightly braided behind his head

5015
03:47:12.280 --> 03:47:15.490
that goes almost to his mid-back.

5016
03:47:15.490 --> 03:47:20.180
He has his chin area shaved and this heavy, heavy mustache

5017
03:47:20.180 --> 03:47:22.650
that's braided in two braids that dangle past his waist,

5018
03:47:22.650 --> 03:47:24.530
but they're tied to his sides

5019
03:47:24.530 --> 03:47:25.900
so they won't get in the way of his work.

5020
03:47:25.900 --> 03:47:28.520
You see him wearing a leather apron, leather gauntlets,

5021
03:47:28.520 --> 03:47:31.150
and he's clutching a smithy hammer in one hand

5022
03:47:31.150 --> 03:47:33.190
and he comes to the door and goes,

5023
03:47:33.190 --> 03:47:36.600
"Sorry, you were saying, what were you saying?

5024
03:47:36.600 --> 03:47:37.970
"Were you saying Dulgrim?"

5025
03:47:37.970 --> 03:47:41.300
TALIESIN: We were hoping to have a conversation with

5026
03:47:41.300 --> 03:47:43.840
a Dulgrim Smeltborne?

5027
03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:46.440
MATT: "I take it you're not from around here, are you?"

5028
03:47:46.440 --> 03:47:48.703
LAURA: No, we've come a very long way to talk to him.

5029
03:47:48.703 --> 03:47:49.960
MARISHA: Why, is he dead or something?

5030
03:47:49.960 --> 03:47:51.820
MATT: "Yes, he passed away about four years ago."

5031
03:47:51.820 --> 03:47:54.890
MARISHA: Fuck!

5032
03:47:56.250 --> 03:47:59.267
SAM: She means we're sorry for your loss.

5033
03:47:59.267 --> 03:48:03.700
[laughter]

5034
03:48:03.700 --> 03:48:06.770
Many blessings be upon his memory.

5035
03:48:06.770 --> 03:48:11.770
Did he have an apprentice or a son or daughter or?

5036
03:48:12.370 --> 03:48:13.910
MATT: "I'm Umagorn, I'm his son."

5037
03:48:15.755 --> 03:48:19.440
SAM: Did he teach you his ways?

5038
03:48:20.610 --> 03:48:23.947
MATT: "No," as he holds up his blacksmithy hammer.

5039
03:48:23.947 --> 03:48:26.520
[laughter]

5040
03:48:26.520 --> 03:48:30.770
TALIESIN: We have a deeply complicated job

5041
03:48:30.770 --> 03:48:35.212
that we were hoping to find someone to help us with.

5042
03:48:35.212 --> 03:48:37.630
May I show you what the--

5043
03:48:38.510 --> 03:48:39.660
LAURA: We brought cupcakes.

5044
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:44.150
SAM: And money.
[laughter]

5045
03:48:44.150 --> 03:48:47.190
MARISHA: And booze.

5046
03:48:47.190 --> 03:48:50.620
MATT: "Get the fuck in."
[laughter]

5047
03:48:54.260 --> 03:48:56.790
You guys enter and you can see there is an assistant,

5048
03:48:56.790 --> 03:49:01.770
this very young, probably mid-teen elf girl

5049
03:49:01.770 --> 03:49:03.520
who is also similarly dressed

5050
03:49:03.520 --> 03:49:05.160
and is currently the assistant to the forge,

5051
03:49:05.160 --> 03:49:06.270
who's holding the heavy metal tongs

5052
03:49:06.270 --> 03:49:08.000
and you can see her holding

5053
03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:09.990
a metal blank for some sort of a weapon

5054
03:49:10.860 --> 03:49:12.830
and is just in the process of wiping her brow,

5055
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:16.250
looking over at the rest of you and gives a wave.

5056
03:49:16.250 --> 03:49:18.100
As he walks and he takes his gauntlets off

5057
03:49:18.100 --> 03:49:20.230
and slaps them down on top of one of the side by tables,

5058
03:49:20.230 --> 03:49:23.200
turns around, "All right, cupcake?"

5059
03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:25.800
LAURA: Which flavor do you like?
MATT: "Pick one."

5060
03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:28.050
LAURA: Ooh, I'm going to give him a blueberry one.

5061
03:49:29.740 --> 03:49:33.070
MATT: "Alcohol."

5062
03:49:34.830 --> 03:49:36.746
Swishes it around in his cheeks.

5063
03:49:36.746 --> 03:49:39.746
[laughter]

5064
03:49:41.878 --> 03:49:44.840
"You have my attention, so, you're looking for my dad.

5065
03:49:44.840 --> 03:49:46.830
"What for?"

5066
03:49:46.830 --> 03:49:48.190
TALIESIN: Cut to the chase.

5067
03:49:48.190 --> 03:49:51.642
I'm going to put the broken sword in front of him.

5068
03:49:52.910 --> 03:49:55.350
MATT: He takes both halves and sets them down.

5069
03:49:55.350 --> 03:49:57.140
Reaches over and grabs the lantern off to the side

5070
03:49:57.140 --> 03:49:59.380
and lights it and hangs it from a chain

5071
03:49:59.380 --> 03:50:01.520
and sets it down so it dangles.

5072
03:50:02.500 --> 03:50:04.950
MARISHA: We came from Kravaraad.

5073
03:50:04.950 --> 03:50:07.630
LAURA: And much farther before that.

5074
03:50:09.420 --> 03:50:12.300
MATT: "So you came from the Sanctum?"

5075
03:50:12.300 --> 03:50:14.760
MARISHA: They pointed us to you.

5076
03:50:14.760 --> 03:50:19.098
TALIESIN: We're on a mission for the Wildmother.

5077
03:50:20.360 --> 03:50:21.460
MATT: "Well, I definitely reckon

5078
03:50:21.460 --> 03:50:25.303
"my father's craftsmanship in shoring up the blade.

5079
03:50:26.660 --> 03:50:28.777
"The repairs look difficult."

5080
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:31.798
LAURA: But you can do it!

5081
03:50:31.798 --> 03:50:33.780
MATT: "I don't know.

5082
03:50:33.780 --> 03:50:36.520
"Give me just a second," and he gets up and walks off

5083
03:50:36.520 --> 03:50:38.420
and you see he starts rummaging through

5084
03:50:38.420 --> 03:50:40.590
a couple of crates

5085
03:50:40.590 --> 03:50:43.460
on the far side of the room and he's pulling things out

5086
03:50:43.460 --> 03:50:46.560
and glass containers, robes, outfits,

5087
03:50:46.560 --> 03:50:49.410
looks like probably keepsakes from his father

5088
03:50:49.410 --> 03:50:51.360
that were placed away to be stored

5089
03:50:51.360 --> 03:50:54.260
and he pulls out a small, leather book,

5090
03:50:54.260 --> 03:50:56.960
like a little pocketbook, and begins thumbing through.

5091
03:50:58.040 --> 03:50:59.670
While you're there, you see the little elven girl,

5092
03:50:59.670 --> 03:51:02.840
she's sitting, she's placed the metal blank

5093
03:51:02.840 --> 03:51:04.790
and quenched it in the water

5094
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:06.810
and set it aside and she's quietly in the corner,

5095
03:51:06.810 --> 03:51:11.580
watching wide-eyed, this waifish girl,

5096
03:51:11.580 --> 03:51:14.400
with big arms. She's pretty tough for a waifish, elven girl.

5097
03:51:14.400 --> 03:51:16.950
She's been working this forge for a while.

5098
03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:20.830
Actually, Beau and her probably have similar arm structure.

5099
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:23.110
MARISHA: I compare my guns.

5100
03:51:23.110 --> 03:51:24.310
Are mine bigger?
MATT: How so?

5101
03:51:24.310 --> 03:51:26.220
Like do you just look at them or do you like?

5102
03:51:26.220 --> 03:51:28.110
Challenge?
MARISHA: I kind of

5103
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:32.240
inch towards her and just.
[laughter]

5104
03:51:33.300 --> 03:51:36.898
MATT: She looks at you quietly and flexes too.

5105
03:51:36.898 --> 03:51:40.025
[laughter]

5106
03:51:40.025 --> 03:51:41.908
MARISHA: That's pretty good.

5107
03:51:43.090 --> 03:51:44.740
What's your name?

5108
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:48.733
MATT: She makes a hand motion.

5109
03:51:51.690 --> 03:51:55.700
MARISHA: I know Dwarvish, but I don't-- fuck.

5110
03:51:56.680 --> 03:51:58.080
I pull out my paper.

5111
03:51:58.080 --> 03:52:00.090
MATT: As you're doing this, Umagorn is in the process

5112
03:52:00.090 --> 03:52:01.820
of going through his book, goes,

5113
03:52:01.820 --> 03:52:05.779
"That's Deilin, she doesn't speak, but she can hear you.

5114
03:52:05.779 --> 03:52:08.610
"Deilin."

5115
03:52:11.290 --> 03:52:14.520
He goes through and finds, he goes, "Oh, oh, oh."

5116
03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:16.570
He comes over and pulls the page and brings it over.

5117
03:52:16.570 --> 03:52:18.300
If you have something you want to do real fast,

5118
03:52:18.300 --> 03:52:19.270
since he's coming over with the book,

5119
03:52:19.270 --> 03:52:21.330
what do you want to do?
MARISHA: I'll

5120
03:52:21.330 --> 03:52:22.420
talk to Deilin later.

5121
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:26.040
MATT: Sets down the book and you can see

5122
03:52:26.040 --> 03:52:28.330
the page that he has open, there are sketches

5123
03:52:28.330 --> 03:52:31.220
of the exact blade that you have there as one.

5124
03:52:31.220 --> 03:52:33.153
TALIESIN: Look at that.

5125
03:52:34.100 --> 03:52:36.358
MATT: "All right, well, there's,

5126
03:52:37.780 --> 03:52:40.800
"there's certainly some good news.

5127
03:52:40.800 --> 03:52:44.090
"I can probably repair this.

5128
03:52:44.090 --> 03:52:46.640
"Bad news, I don't have the material needed."

5129
03:52:46.640 --> 03:52:49.840
TALIESIN: Refined residuum, I assume.
MATT: "No.

5130
03:52:49.840 --> 03:52:51.310
"I don't even know what that is."

5131
03:52:52.460 --> 03:52:54.270
LAURA: What, what do you need?
TALIESIN: Interesting.

5132
03:52:55.350 --> 03:52:56.970
MATT: "Well, if you look here," and he points out

5133
03:52:56.970 --> 03:52:59.130
to the base of the blade, you can see there's elements

5134
03:52:59.130 --> 03:53:02.320
that creep up and there's these faint veins

5135
03:53:02.320 --> 03:53:04.020
around some of the runes that have this

5136
03:53:04.020 --> 03:53:07.500
blueish, black-blue metal color, he goes,

5137
03:53:07.500 --> 03:53:10.320
"This, this is called iceflex."
SAM: Iceflex?

5138
03:53:11.350 --> 03:53:13.020
MATT: "It's a treated form of mithral

5139
03:53:13.020 --> 03:53:17.980
"that is used and it's very difficult to attain and

5140
03:53:17.980 --> 03:53:22.959
"is what could repair this and bring the magic back whole.

5141
03:53:22.959 --> 03:53:26.170
"I don't have any."
LAURA: Where would you get it?

5142
03:53:26.170 --> 03:53:28.980
MATT: "Well, you see, iceflex is a nickname for mithral

5143
03:53:28.980 --> 03:53:33.260
"that's been treated with white dragon breath."

5144
03:53:33.260 --> 03:53:35.540
[exclamations]

5145
03:53:35.540 --> 03:53:36.830
SAM: White what?

5146
03:53:37.860 --> 03:53:39.300
MATT: "White dragon breath.

5147
03:53:40.640 --> 03:53:44.700
"It infuses the metal with its subtle ice, wintery magic.

5148
03:53:44.700 --> 03:53:46.060
"Some mumbo jumbo like that.

5149
03:53:46.060 --> 03:53:48.450
"I don't know, you have to go to the fucking steeple

5150
03:53:48.450 --> 03:53:50.400
"to get more information about that, but--"

5151
03:53:50.400 --> 03:53:51.920
LIAM: The steeple?

5152
03:53:51.920 --> 03:53:53.210
MATT: "The Vellum Steeple.

5153
03:53:53.210 --> 03:53:55.717
"It's kind of the archive."

5154
03:53:57.230 --> 03:54:00.800
[laughter]

5155
03:54:00.800 --> 03:54:03.162
TALIESIN: Oh, you shouldn't have said that.

5156
03:54:04.380 --> 03:54:05.930
MATT: "They'll know where to find white dragon, probably,

5157
03:54:05.930 --> 03:54:08.000
"if anyone could but--"
LAURA: Do you think

5158
03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:11.930
maybe somebody just has extra iceflex hanging around?

5159
03:54:11.930 --> 03:54:12.880
MATT: "Feel free to ask.

5160
03:54:14.360 --> 03:54:15.330
"The only person I could think of, though,

5161
03:54:15.330 --> 03:54:16.980
"that'd possibly have some shit like that

5162
03:54:16.980 --> 03:54:20.130
"would be the Plexus Post, Ava, but she's crazy."

5163
03:54:20.130 --> 03:54:21.790
SAM: The what?
TRAVIS: Plexus Post.

5164
03:54:21.790 --> 03:54:23.840
MATT: "The Plexus Post."
LAURA: Ava?

5165
03:54:26.660 --> 03:54:28.260
MATT: "Master Ava Endlewood.

5166
03:54:28.260 --> 03:54:29.560
"She's kind of a collector."

5167
03:54:30.770 --> 03:54:33.400
TALIESIN: What kind of crazy, if you don't mind me asking?

5168
03:54:33.400 --> 03:54:34.610
MATT: "Kind of crazy who has a building

5169
03:54:34.610 --> 03:54:39.196
"that's just filled with things she's collected.

5170
03:54:39.196 --> 03:54:41.880
"She's a strange one."
TALIESIN: I can handle that.

5171
03:54:41.880 --> 03:54:45.570
LIAM: She is at this archive?

5172
03:54:45.570 --> 03:54:48.237
Not that I care.
LAURA: The Plexy Post.

5173
03:54:48.237 --> 03:54:50.300
She's at the Plexus Post.

5174
03:54:50.300 --> 03:54:51.990
The Plexus Post?

5175
03:54:51.990 --> 03:54:54.070
MATT: "That's where Ava is, yeah."
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

5176
03:54:54.070 --> 03:54:56.960
SAM: So we go to Ava, we get something from her,

5177
03:54:56.960 --> 03:54:58.860
then we go do research at the Steeple,

5178
03:54:58.860 --> 03:55:00.960
then we go kill a white dragon.

5179
03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:02.820
TALIESIN: Well--
MARISHA: No, you can go kill a,

5180
03:55:02.820 --> 03:55:04.440
no--
MATT: "You don't have to kill it.

5181
03:55:04.440 --> 03:55:08.200
"You just have to get the metal enchanted with its breath."

5182
03:55:08.200 --> 03:55:09.690
MARISHA: So wait, you like--
SAM: Oh, that's easy.

5183
03:55:09.690 --> 03:55:12.280
MARISHA: Hold the metal up to the dragon and be like:

5184
03:55:12.280 --> 03:55:14.750
Breathe on this!

5185
03:55:14.750 --> 03:55:16.771
MATT: "Good luck, yeah."

5186
03:55:16.771 --> 03:55:18.630
LAURA: Or, maybe--
MATT: "That's certainly one way."

5187
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:19.940
LAURA: Maybe you could run up to it

5188
03:55:19.940 --> 03:55:21.330
and one person could be like, "Bleh!"

5189
03:55:21.330 --> 03:55:23.290
so it tries to attack you and then another person

5190
03:55:23.290 --> 03:55:24.870
who's invisible will be invisible

5191
03:55:24.870 --> 03:55:26.790
and they will hold something up in front of it

5192
03:55:26.790 --> 03:55:28.510
and then the dragon won't see you

5193
03:55:28.510 --> 03:55:30.270
and then the dragon will breathe fire

5194
03:55:30.270 --> 03:55:31.760
at the person that's distracting

5195
03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:34.470
and then they would accidentally have infused the mithral.

5196
03:55:34.470 --> 03:55:37.630
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: "That's also a method.

5197
03:55:37.630 --> 03:55:38.690
"Good luck."

5198
03:55:38.690 --> 03:55:40.780
SAM: Do you know any white dragons?

5199
03:55:40.780 --> 03:55:43.450
MATT: "I don't, but you can certainly ask.

5200
03:55:43.450 --> 03:55:45.440
"The Steeple probably has some idea."

5201
03:55:45.440 --> 03:55:48.120
LAURA: Or, or instead of having a person be the distractor,

5202
03:55:48.120 --> 03:55:51.495
Fjord, you could just cast your Major Illusion--!

5203
03:55:51.495 --> 03:55:54.402
[gasping]

5204
03:55:56.020 --> 03:55:57.920
Or...

5205
03:55:57.920 --> 03:56:01.163
You could just say hi.

5206
03:56:02.951 --> 03:56:07.951
MARISHA: (laughs)
[laughter]

5207
03:56:08.665 --> 03:56:11.890
LAURA: Do you want a cupcake?

5208
03:56:11.890 --> 03:56:14.090
TRAVIS: I'm fine, thank you.

5209
03:56:14.090 --> 03:56:16.890
TALIESIN: Nothing wrong with doing it the hard way.

5210
03:56:16.890 --> 03:56:20.248
MARISHA: So if you got this iceflex

5211
03:56:20.248 --> 03:56:23.200
from some dragon,

5212
03:56:23.200 --> 03:56:24.370
it could theoretically

5213
03:56:24.370 --> 03:56:28.310
be hundreds of years old, I'm assuming.

5214
03:56:28.310 --> 03:56:29.870
MATT: "I don't know, I don't know much about dragons."

5215
03:56:29.870 --> 03:56:32.357
MARISHA: What's your name, by the way?

5216
03:56:32.357 --> 03:56:33.200
MATT: "It's Umagorn.

5217
03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:35.542
"I already told you that when you came in.

5218
03:56:35.542 --> 03:56:37.340
"Umagorn Smeltborne."

5219
03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:40.440
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm still, your accent's thick.

5220
03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:45.440
MATT: "That's fine. Humans."

5221
03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:48.880
TRAVIS: Right, so, if we acquire some of this iceflex

5222
03:56:48.880 --> 03:56:51.770
as you've said, then we should return here,

5223
03:56:51.770 --> 03:56:55.153
you might be able to do some work on it, perhaps--

5224
03:56:55.153 --> 03:56:56.530
MATT: "I'm going to ask you a question."

5225
03:56:56.530 --> 03:56:57.363
TRAVIS: Yes?

5226
03:56:57.363 --> 03:57:00.243
MATT: "What do you need this sword for?"

5227
03:57:00.243 --> 03:57:03.921
TRAVIS: (sighs) How much time do we have?

5228
03:57:03.921 --> 03:57:05.400
TALIESIN: You can sum it up.
MATT: "No.

5229
03:57:05.400 --> 03:57:07.820
"What do you need this sword for?"

5230
03:57:07.820 --> 03:57:09.120
SAM: To kill things.

5231
03:57:10.350 --> 03:57:12.350
MATT: "What kind of things?"

5232
03:57:12.350 --> 03:57:15.100
TRAVIS: Ancient evils that have been unleashed

5233
03:57:15.100 --> 03:57:16.910
after being dormant for hundreds of years.

5234
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:20.553
I know, it sounds thrilling.

5235
03:57:20.553 --> 03:57:22.200
MATT: "Is he fucking with me?"

5236
03:57:22.200 --> 03:57:24.050
TALIESIN: No, he's really not.

5237
03:57:24.050 --> 03:57:26.930
LAURA: Do you know there's this guy who's really big

5238
03:57:26.930 --> 03:57:31.910
and he's got lots of mouths on him and

5239
03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:33.230
he's really bad.

5240
03:57:34.737 --> 03:57:37.850
SAM: He's called The Laughing Hand.

5241
03:57:37.850 --> 03:57:41.190
He's a demon fiend thing from the Abyss.

5242
03:57:41.190 --> 03:57:42.556
MATT: "This is the strangest morning

5243
03:57:42.556 --> 03:57:44.106
"I've had in a long time."

5244
03:57:44.106 --> 03:57:48.855
SAM: Well, I mean, we did give you a cupcake, so.

5245
03:57:48.855 --> 03:57:49.870
MATT: "You did and you caught my attention.

5246
03:57:49.870 --> 03:57:50.720
"Look, look, look.

5247
03:57:52.060 --> 03:57:53.840
"I've got orders to fulfill.

5248
03:57:53.840 --> 03:57:55.690
"I don't have any mithral on me right now.

5249
03:57:55.690 --> 03:57:58.470
"If you want supplies, you got to get some mithral,

5250
03:57:58.470 --> 03:58:00.080
"get it taken care of.

5251
03:58:00.080 --> 03:58:01.200
"I don't know how you're going to do that,

5252
03:58:01.200 --> 03:58:02.430
"but when you do, bring it back,

5253
03:58:02.430 --> 03:58:04.070
"and we can work out some sort of a deal

5254
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:06.140
"to make this, I know I can do it.

5255
03:58:06.140 --> 03:58:08.230
"I just don't have the means."

5256
03:58:08.230 --> 03:58:09.380
TRAVIS: Sure, we can do that.

5257
03:58:09.380 --> 03:58:10.610
You should know that your father

5258
03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:13.270
worked on very important items like this before.

5259
03:58:13.270 --> 03:58:14.420
I know he was very old

5260
03:58:14.420 --> 03:58:17.120
and we're sorry to hear that he passed.

5261
03:58:17.120 --> 03:58:19.840
This could turn the tide in a great way.

5262
03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:24.100
There are entities that you don't want to know much about

5263
03:58:24.100 --> 03:58:26.100
and neither do we, but we've been tasked

5264
03:58:26.100 --> 03:58:27.780
with finding a way to try and defeat them

5265
03:58:27.780 --> 03:58:31.280
and this could be a key to that effort.

5266
03:58:31.280 --> 03:58:33.180
We'll return with the items that you said

5267
03:58:33.180 --> 03:58:38.160
and with the coin and more cupcakes and ale.

5268
03:58:38.160 --> 03:58:40.150
But we appreciate your time.

5269
03:58:40.150 --> 03:58:41.741
It means a lot.

5270
03:58:42.960 --> 03:58:45.802
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

5271
03:58:50.580 --> 03:58:53.870
TRAVIS: 21.
[cheering]

5272
03:58:56.820 --> 03:59:00.770
MATT: You begin talking and he's looking down at the ground

5273
03:59:00.770 --> 03:59:02.780
and eventually his eyes meet yours

5274
03:59:02.780 --> 03:59:04.190
and he gives this intense stare,

5275
03:59:04.190 --> 03:59:07.650
like he's looking into and through you.

5276
03:59:07.650 --> 03:59:10.210
As the words continue, you see him slacken a bit

5277
03:59:10.210 --> 03:59:12.710
in his chair and his chin raises a bit and he goes,

5278
03:59:15.230 --> 03:59:17.320
"My father didn't make things like this for money.

5279
03:59:17.320 --> 03:59:19.020
"He made them for the right people.

5280
03:59:20.450 --> 03:59:22.680
"You seem forthright and honest.

5281
03:59:24.980 --> 03:59:26.160
"If you seem like the kind of person

03:59:26.160 --> 03:59:27.280
"that's stupid enough to go ahead

5283
03:59:27.280 --> 03:59:28.490
"and go running towards a dragon

03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:31.730
"to get this thing blown on and you return

"and what you're saying is true,

03:59:34.970 --> 03:59:35.920
"I'll do it for you.

03:59:37.320 --> 03:59:40.660
"But you go telling folks

03:59:40.660 --> 03:59:43.677
"that Umagorn Smeltborne

03:59:43.677 --> 03:59:47.180
"has reached his father's level, huh?"

5290
03:59:47.180 --> 03:59:48.590
TRAVIS: It would be our absolute pleasure

5291
03:59:48.590 --> 03:59:51.270
to spread that exact tale.

5292
03:59:51.270 --> 03:59:53.170
MATT: "Great.

5293
03:59:53.170 --> 03:59:56.810
"Survive."
[laughter]

5294
03:59:56.810 --> 03:59:59.410
TRAVIS: Yes, I agree, that is the first step.

5295
03:59:59.410 --> 04:00:00.243
MATT: "Who knows, you might find some

5296
04:00:00.243 --> 04:00:01.584

LAURA: We will.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5299
04:00:05.000 --> 04:00:07.570
TALIESIN: We need to find a few other things, too, so.

LAURA: Deilin.

5308
04:00:21.140 --> 04:00:23.110
MARISHA: Yeah, I just go up to Deilin really quick

5309
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:28.110
and pull out my notebook and tell her

5310
04:00:28.775 --> 04:00:33.652
I'm Beauregard, we'll talk again soon, okay?

5311
04:00:34.959 --> 04:00:36.192
I'm going to go.

5312
04:00:36.192 --> 04:00:37.640

MATT: She grabs a bite of a little sandwich

5316
04:00:48.210 --> 04:00:51.040
on a plate off the way.

5317
04:00:51.040 --> 04:00:53.431
Umagorn is like, "All right,"

5318
04:00:53.431 --> 04:00:55.631
gets up, takes his book, folds it up,

5319
04:00:55.631 --> 04:00:58.685
puts it back in the crate, turns around.

5320
04:00:58.685 --> 04:01:00.300
"Anything else?"
SAM: No, we're off, we're off.

5321
04:01:00.300 --> 04:01:03.940
LAURA: No, no, I give Deilin a cupcake on the way out,

5322
04:01:03.940 --> 04:01:05.960
just because, you know, I don't want--

SAM: Sure, sure.
MATT: Takes it.

5324
04:01:07.190 --> 04:01:10.850
Looks over at Umagorn with an expectation.

5325
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:15.820
"All right, eat it, then we'll get back to work."

5326
04:01:15.820 --> 04:01:18.453
Scarfs it hungrily.

5327
04:01:19.590 --> 04:01:23.300
SAM: Well, we have quite a mission in front of us.

5328
04:01:23.300 --> 04:01:28.300
We have to find a dragon and get it to blow us.

5329
04:01:28.362 --> 04:01:31.710
[laughter]

5330
04:01:31.710 --> 04:01:33.690
LAURA: Yes, that's going to be very hard.

SAM: Yes.

5332
04:01:38.640 --> 04:01:41.000
We can--

5333
04:01:41.000 --> 04:01:42.240
We can do it, though.

5334
04:01:42.240 --> 04:01:45.570
We've done harder things.

5335
04:01:45.570 --> 04:01:48.653
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation

5336
04:01:48.653 --> 04:01:49.900
and as you've been keeping your eye out

5337
04:01:49.900 --> 04:01:52.920
to see if you're being followed,

5338
04:01:52.920 --> 04:01:56.090
a cloaked figure from the nearby shadows,

5339
04:01:56.090 --> 04:02:01.090
from the backside of the temple begins to approach you.

5340
04:02:01.550 --> 04:02:03.587
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

5345
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:31.660

MATT: The fabulous friend, Mica Burton, will be joining us.

5347
04:02:36.627 --> 04:02:37.950
Maybe you know her from Overwatch League

5348
04:02:37.950 --> 04:02:40.960

You're fine.

5371
04:03:57.920 --> 04:03:59.910
Any last words before we find out?

5372
04:03:59.910 --> 04:04:02.960
This has been the long, drawn-out

5373
04:04:02.960 --> 04:04:05.620
tens of thousands of dollars in post-production

5374

has been spent on one of the candidates' ads specifically.

Any last words before we begin

and find out the results, Liam?

5377
04:04:17.020 --> 04:04:18.440
LIAM: For the good of D&amp;D Beyond,

However,

I have to say, there is one person

If I'm being honest,

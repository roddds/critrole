00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.830
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.943
of Critical Role where a bunch

3
00:00:02.943 --> 00:00:04.050
of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.385
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:07.420
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.270
LIAM: Dragons.

7
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.260
MATT: Before I get into tonight's game,

8
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.940
we have a few announcements to get through.

9
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.970
First and foremost,

10
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.780
we have two fantastic sponsors this evening.

11
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.420
Our first, our friends for campaign two

12
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.682
from beginning to now for Episode 69.

13
00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.150
(wooing)

14
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.817
MATT, MARISHA, SAM: Nice.

15
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.913
MATT: Our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Sam.

16
00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:30.553
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

17
00:00:30.553 --> 00:00:31.740
SAM: (throat clear)

18
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.010
That just hit me.

19
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.220
D&amp;D Beyond wants you to know that the new D&amp;D Essentials Kit

20
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.420
is coming to Tar-jay.

21
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.480
It includes a newly designed rule book that onboards players

22
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.220
by teaching them how to make characters and adventures.

23
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.550
The box includes several codes for D&amp;D Beyond

24
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.380
and they've also created a new tutorial page

25
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.170
focused on how to onboard new players into the game

26
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.916
that we all know and love at dndbeyond.com/essentials.

27
00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:59.090
The Essentials Kit is available exclusively at Target

28
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.620
until September 3rd, 2019.

29
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.474
Now, sorry, quick announcement here, guys.

30
00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:04.307
LAURA: Uh-huh.

31
00:01:04.307 --> 00:01:05.800
SAM: As you know, my campaign to become

32
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.190
the President of D&amp;D Beyond President.

33
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.380
Wow.

34
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.278
Has been suspended. That is powerful stuff.

35
00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:14.470
(laughter)

36
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.600
LIAM: You are welcome.

37
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.910
TRAVIS: We got an eternal loop going.

38
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.930
SAM: I had to suspend my campaign because of a filthy rumor

39
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.580
from the O'Brien campaign.

40
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.520
He decided to go low, campaign, and accuse me

41
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.300
of colluding with a foreign power,

42
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.890
lying about it, and making a deepfake video to cover it up,

43
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.410
which sounds like me, but was not, I promise.

44
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.320
So I am announcing that my campaign has resumed as of today

45
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.580
because I am a fighter, I am a believer,

46
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.310
and because I have a special secret weapon.

47
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.980
I am a great debater.

48
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.456
In fact, some would say I'm a master debater.

49
00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:53.180
TRAVIS: Oh god.
MARISHA: Classic.

50
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.940
SAM: Actually, I got that nickname in high school.

51
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.870
When I would walk down the hall, kids would say,

52
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.260
"There goes Sam, the master debater."

53
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.670
And they were right.

54
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.000
I master debate all the time.

55
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.630
I master debate in the shower.

56
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.940
I master debate in the back of a Lyft.

57
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.937
I will come to your house

58
00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:13.852
and master debate in your closet while you are asleep.

59
00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.900
My master debating never stops.

60
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.150
Which is why I am challenging Liam O'Brien

61
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.190
to a debate right here, sometime in July.

62
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.980
You guys can all tune in and watch me

63
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.410
master debate Liam O'Brien in front of your own eyes.

64
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.243
LIAM: Oh, well...

65
00:02:29.243 --> 00:02:34.230
SAM: I will master debate Liam O'Brien as long as it takes

66
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.230
until he comes to the realization that I am even more

67
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.863
of a furious master debater than him.

68
00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:44.740
But I'll need your help.

69
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.570
So go ahead and tweet your debate questions

70
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.500
to @DnDBeyond and make sure

71
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.082
to include the hashtag #MasterDebater.

72
00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:54.400
TRAVIS: Yeah.

73
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.360
SAM: I'm sure they'll appreciate that.

74
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.193
TRAVIS: Yes.

75
00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:00.820
SAM: Thank you for your support, your faith in my campaign.

76
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.270
Remember, rule of cool always beats rules as written.

77
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.080
God bless Sam-merica.

78
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.190
Everyone, master debate yourself tonight.

79
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.710
TRAVIS: Wow.

80
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.543
Wow.

81
00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:14.332
LIAM: Did you ever master debate backstage of Les Mis?

82
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.160
SAM: Yeah, I had a robe.
LIAM: Okay, okay.

83
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.860
SAM: That would cover up myself while I was master debating.

84
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.650
I just wanted to be snug, that's all.

85
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.980
ASHLEY: When did you start master debating?

86
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.410
SAM: You know, I think I really found I had a knack

87
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.070
for it around 12 or 13.

88
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.903
ASHLEY: Really?

89
00:03:31.903 --> 00:03:34.650
SAM: Yeah, that's when I really got into master debating.

90
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.483
ASHLEY: Yeah.

91
00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:37.080
SAM: Spent a lot of time.

92
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.610
TRAVIS: Did anyone teach you how to master debate?

93
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.690
SAM: I'm self-taught, but recently I've been master debating

94
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.900
with my left hand.

95
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.320
(laughter)

96
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.239
You know, for emphasis.

97
00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.197
For emphasis.

98
00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:49.780
You know, I feel like it really changes the game.

99
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.770
TRAVIS: Do you go open hand or closed fist?

100
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.770
LIAM: What is the longest span

101
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.300
of time you've ever master debated?

102
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.982
SAM: Oh, I can master debate for up to two minutes.

103
00:03:59.982 --> 00:04:02.565
(laughter)

104
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.050
TRAVIS: So you wouldn't have what some politicians

105
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.423
would call stamina.

106
00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:10.890
(laughter)

107
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.410
SAM: Some politicians would call it that.

108
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.600
But I got to go to sleep after I master debate.

109
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.970
So you know, I'm pretty relaxed.

110
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.920
MARISHA: You would think with all that master debating,

111
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.660
you would be a perfect candidate

112
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.430
for filibuster though, right?

113
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.213
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Hey, that's true.

114
00:04:26.213 --> 00:04:28.710
ASHLEY: Were you on a master debating team?

115
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.680
MARISHA: Yes.

116
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.942
SAM: In college, I did master debate with a group.

117
00:04:32.942 --> 00:04:36.788
But it was just once and it didn't feel right.

118
00:04:36.788 --> 00:04:38.405
I was pretty drunk.
LAURA: Oh god.

119
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.770
LIAM: Master debating is best when it's one-on-one.

120
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.380
SAM: It's true, it really is.

121
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.590
And that's what it'll be in July.

122
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.280
Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

123
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.341
LIAM: God, I love politics.

124
00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:52.310
TRAVIS: My heart rate is up, elevated.

125
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.970
MARISHA: Yeah.

126
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.290
SAM: Have they fired us yet?

127
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.640
MATT: I can't.

128
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.920
I can't.

129
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.753
I can't.

130
00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:02.020
LIAM: Matt's been blue screening

131
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.730
for the last minute and a half.

132
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.430
TALIESIN: Ow.
MATT: Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

133
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.722
I am so sorry.

134
00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:11.290
(laughter)

135
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.973
TRAVIS: No, nope.
SAM: Yeah.

136
00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:15.978
MATT: Our second sponsor, thankfully, I'm announcing.

137
00:05:15.978 --> 00:05:18.920
(laughter)

138
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.870
Returning tonight, sponsor of tonight's episode as well,

139
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.470
our friends at Idle Champions.

140
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.220
We've talked about before, returning now

141
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.990
with a cool announcement we'll tell you in a second.

142
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.110
For those that aren't familiar,

143
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.600
Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms

144
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.260
is an awesome strategy game that you can collect

145
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.040
D&amp;D characters from novels, campaigns, and lore

146
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.500
about the D&amp;D Forgotten Realms universe

147
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.340
in one epic adventure.

148
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.180
And it's drawn from all sorts of ancillary realms as well,

149
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.880
even Arkhan, the resident dick-bag dragonborn

150
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.860
that stole the Hand of Vecna at the end

151
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.160
of our last campaign is in there.

152
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.340
SAM: Dick-bag dragonborn.
TRAVIS: Hand of Vecna.

153
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.710
LIAM: That's one of the chromatic, right?

154
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.260
MATT: I think so, yeah.

155
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.085
Yeah.

156
00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:53.918
LIAM: Bronze.

157
00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:57.040
MATT: From the Vox Machina standpoint, I think it holds.

158
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.600
But no, each champion bring in their adds,

159
00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.710
depths, and strategy to the game

160
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.660
as you quest to complete the various world quests,

161
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.493
I imagine.

162
00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:05.660
Adventures taken from official D&amp;D modules and adventures

163
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.110
that have come out, including Dragon Heist

164
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.210
and Curse of Strahd.

165
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.590
It is available for PC and Mac on Steam,

166
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.290
Xbox One, PlayStation 4, iPad, and all Android devices,

167
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.030
and tonight's special announcement

168
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.680
is that it's now available on iPhone.

169
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.460
So you can keep your champions idle

170
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.320
on the go, which is pretty fun.

171
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.100
SAM: I have an iPhone, that works for me.

172
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.950
MATT: You should check it out, Sam.

173
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.050
SAM: I will, I will indeed.

174
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.990
MATT: When you're not busy master debating.

175
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.670
It's hard to multi-task for you.

176
00:06:34.681 --> 00:06:35.916
LIAM: You'll have time to squeeze it in?

177
00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:38.635
(laughter)

178
00:06:38.635 --> 00:06:39.468
MATT: It's on the App Store now.

179
00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:42.160
Let's celebrate the launch with a free gold chest

180
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.095
when you enter the code "NowOnIphone."

181
00:06:46.095 --> 00:06:47.740
I was like, now on the phone.

182
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.080
There was no spaces.

183
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.430
"NowOnIphone," one word, in the in-game shop

184
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.880
to get your free gold chest.

185
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.713

187

All righty.

188
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.400
Got a few more announcements here.

189
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.800
You can join us Saturday, July 20th

190
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.400
for our Talks Machina panel at San Diego Comic-Con.

191
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.233
ALL: Yay!

192
00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:10.066
MATT: We announced that.

193
00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:12.470
We'll be in Room 6 BCF, for those of you who'll be

194
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.920
down there braving the droves and droves

195
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.260
of us geeks that will be taking

196
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.770
over the Gaslamp District and beyond.

197
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.730
You can check out all the details there

198
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.640
at critrole.com/events.

199
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.530
We also shared an update on our summer programming schedule

200
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.850
yesterday on our socials if you haven't checked it out yet.

201
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.870
Includes, pardon me, updates on Handbooker Helper,

202
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.760
MAME Drop, Travis Willingham's Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

203
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.510
TRAVIS: Yeah, you should, that's a good voice

204
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.140
for the show, actually.

205
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.507
MATT: Between the Sheets, and a special

206
00:07:42.507 --> 00:07:43.757
Call of Cthulhu one-shot

207
00:07:43.757 --> 00:07:45.347
that Taliesin Jaffe here's going to be running.

208
00:07:45.347 --> 00:07:46.180
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yes.

209
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.450
TRAVIS: The immortal.
MATT: Excited about that.

210
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.490
TALIESIN: Fucking end you.

211
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.489
(laughter)

212
00:07:50.489 --> 00:07:51.890
TRAVIS: I'm ready, I'm ready, my body's ready.

213
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.520
I want it now!

214
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.845
MATT: We announced that great guests

215
00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:56.345
will be on there as well.

216
00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:59.200
Check out all the details at critrole.com.

217
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.630
As a reminder, we're taking a short rest next week

218
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.602
as a studio.

219
00:08:03.602 --> 00:08:05.390
All of next week, we'll be dark.

220
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.390
But we'll be back Tuesday, July 9th.

221
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.390
July 9th, that's the day, with Talks Machina.

222
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.960
In the meantime, next week, take a break with us.

223
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.390
Go and get caught up or introduce your friends

224
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.640
to the insane stuff that we do here.

225
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.620
Or just do what we do and relax and breathe.

226
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.320
Yeah, play some of your own D&amp;D.

227
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.660
And last but not least, a huge thank you to our friend here

228
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.560
of the channel, Bryan Forrest, who you've seen

229
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.680
in a few episodes of Handbooker Helper,

230
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.440
but he has designed, created,

231
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.070
and we just recently put up our new Mighty Nein tabard.

232
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.780

233
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.680
Hanging symbol on the back wall there.

234
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.130
It's a series of leather, wood, and actual metal.

235
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.870
It's been all sorts of treated

236
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.200
and burned and shaped and shaved.

237
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.430
Yeah, he's amazing.

238
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.320
So thank you, Bryan.

239
00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.536
You're awesome.

240
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.310
I believe that's the end of our announcements.

241
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.800
So without further ado, let's go ahead

242
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.730
and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

LIAM: Dirty mouth.

279
00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:51.385
MATT: You were super late on that.

280
00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:53.022
Welcome back.

281
00:10:53.022 --> 00:10:57.023
So last we left off, The Mighty Nein

282
00:10:57.023 --> 00:11:00.235
had been chasing down a lead, an individual,

283
00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:01.727
who had been racing northward,

284
00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:04.420
and seemingly is attached to these strange devices

285
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.288
that have been causing rifts to the Abyss to tear open

286
00:11:07.288 --> 00:11:09.071
all across Xhorhas.

287
00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:11.556
In following this individual across the Barbed Fields,

288
00:11:11.556 --> 00:11:14.511
dodging and escaping dangerous encounters,

289
00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:18.381
you found yourself beneath the nearby mountains of Bazzoxan,

290
00:11:18.381 --> 00:11:20.872
traveling through subterranean tunnels

291
00:11:20.872 --> 00:11:22.207
of some ancient dungeon,

292
00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:26.579
once locked by these celestial angel statues.

293
00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:29.507
You made way your way through a bridge

294
00:11:29.507 --> 00:11:31.988
where silence was of the essence,

295
00:11:31.988 --> 00:11:35.401
where it seemed a chasm filled with tortured,

296
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:39.552
twisting flesh, teeth, and eyes would gibber, if you will,

297
00:11:39.552 --> 00:11:42.541
upon hearing the presence of players.

298
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:45.421
Escaping the confusion and a few tumbles,

299
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:46.986
one completely off the edge of the bridge

300
00:11:46.986 --> 00:11:49.856
and into the mass, thankfully salvaged

301
00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:53.363
by a played-via-remote Jester.

302
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.110
And then into a strange, cold maze of mirrors

303
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.170
and a glacial crystal barrier,

304
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.690
upon which inspecting the reflections in the mirrors,

305
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.310
the reflections began to pull some of you in.

306
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.810
In an alternate chamber there, battle was done

307
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.010
with strange reflections, dark reflections of yourselves.

308
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.890
Upon completing that battle, you found a way back

309
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.432
into the main chamber, discovered

310
00:12:21.432 --> 00:12:23.560
the musical key

311
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.700
that managed to open this crystalline barrier.

312
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.350
And behind that, another door,

313
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.960
which contained one of the porcelain celestial sculptures

314
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.200
holding its hands together with a small opening.

315
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.380
You discovered in the mirror realm

316
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.220
some sort of a magical dagger that was embedded in the wall.

317
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.340
Placing it within this sculpture, it unlocked the door,

318
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.835
as the eyes bled, they swung open.

319
00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.610
And that is where we've left off.

320
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.765
So, Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

321
00:12:56.967 --> 00:13:00.395
TRAVIS: Short rest, cast Identify for ten minutes
on that fucking dagger.

322
00:13:00.395 --> 00:13:03.822 line:15%
SAM: Whoa, look at you, smart guy, what the hell?
LAURA: We already put it in the statue.

323
00:13:03.822 --> 00:13:06.240 line:15%
TRAVIS: We've identified something, right?
LIAM: Whip.

324
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.073 line:15%
TRAVIS: The whip.

325
00:13:07.073 --> 00:13:09.023 line:15%
MATT: Yeah. I mean, the dagger's in the door

326
00:13:09.023 --> 00:13:10.930 line:15%
and the door is open at this point.

327
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.480 line:15%
You don't know if it's removable or not.

328
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.760 line:15%
LIAM: All right, what can we see beyond the door?

329
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.360 line:15%
Is it obscured somehow?

330
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.653 line:15%
MATT: Make a perception check.

331
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.260 line:15%
LIAM: That is a 16.

332
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.093 line:15%
MATT: 16.

333
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.682 line:15%
Right now, at this distance, looking in there,

334
00:13:30.682 --> 00:13:35.240 line:15%
it's just darkness, about 20 feet or so of

335
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.073
hallway.

336
00:13:36.073 --> 00:13:37.150 line:15%
And that light that's getting there

337
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.870 line:15%
is just from the light that you guys
are creating in your space.

338
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.960 line:15%
And it just goes into pitch black.

339
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.818 line:15%
LIAM: Do you think this could wait,

340
00:13:44.818 --> 00:13:47.110
or do we need to know now?

341
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.371 line:15%
TRAVIS: I'm afraid we might not get another opportunity,

342
00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:51.380 line:15%
if you get my drift.

343
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.830 line:15%
MARISHA: Are you afraid there's something wrong with it?

344
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.960 line:15%
That it's bad news?

345
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.910 line:15%
TRAVIS: No, not bad news.
What if it's good news?

346
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.488 line:15%
We could use all the help we can get.

347
00:13:58.488 --> 00:13:59.822 line:15%
ASHLEY: Maybe you should--

348
00:13:59.822 --> 00:14:01.090 line:15%
SAM: Say that again.

349
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.097 line:15%
ASHLEY: I was saying to, you know, give it a crack.

350
00:14:03.097 --> 00:14:04.969 line:15%
But I guess you should check it first.

351
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.311 line:15%
SAM: No, that's fair.

352
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.416 line:15%
LIAM: I give it a crack.

353
00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:10.730 line:15%
MATT: Whoo-tish.

354
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.925 line:15%
It echoes through and snaps.

355
00:14:12.925 --> 00:14:17.340 line:15%
The chambers briefly seem to just rock slightly,

356
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.570 line:15%
though it may just be your perspective

357
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.720 line:15%
of the loud snapping of the sound barrier

358
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.850 line:15%
in an isolated place.

359
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.125 line:15%
It is longer than any whip you've seen,

360
00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:27.998 line:15%
and as you crack it, it whirls up

361
00:14:27.998 --> 00:14:31.870 line:15%
and manages to stretch quite a distance before it snaps.

362
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.960 line:15%
LAURA: Identify it, identify it, identify it.

363
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.285 line:15%
SAM: Does it seem like it stretched longer than it actually

364
00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:39.220
is when he's holding it at rest?

365
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.664 line:15%
MATT: It's hard to tell.

366
00:14:40.664 --> 00:14:41.780 line:15%
LAURA: (growls)

367
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.850 line:15%
LIAM: So I walk away from the door and sit

368
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.035 line:15%
and cross-cross applesauce and begin to identify.

369
00:14:47.035 --> 00:14:49.734 line:15%
TRAVIS: We could all do the same, take a short rest, yeah?

370
00:14:49.734 --> 00:14:51.756 line:15%
LAURA: A short rest takes 30 minutes, you want it?

371
00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:53.235 line:15%
MATT: A short rest is about an hour.

372
00:14:53.235 --> 00:14:54.284 line:15%
LAURA: An hour.

373
00:14:54.284 --> 00:14:55.598 line:15%
MATT: You can if you want to.

374
00:14:56.873 --> 00:14:57.706 line:15%
It's up to you guys.

375
00:14:57.706 --> 00:14:59.345 line:15%
SAM: We should post up and look for--

376
00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:02.790 line:15%
LIAM: The warlock runs out of gas really easy.

377
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.050 line:15%
MARISHA: I'm good.
TRAVIS: Thank you, it's true.

378
00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.620 line:15%
SAM: I'm good, but you know,
if Fjord needs a little resty-poo,

379
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.700 line:15%
we should take one.

380
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.360 line:15%
TRAVIS: Nobody else needs one,
just me being selfish over here?

381
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.610 line:15%
LIAM: I have been dinged a little bit.

382
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.868 line:15%
ASHLEY: Yeah, same.

383
00:15:15.868 --> 00:15:18.460 line:15%
LIAM: And I don't ever have much, you know?

384
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.530 line:15%
TRAVIS: Might as well stack the deck where we can.

385
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.918 line:15%
Can I get a "Haaay"?

386
00:15:22.918 --> 00:15:24.500 line:15%
MARISHA: (haltingly) H-a-ay.

387
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.970 line:15%
TALIESIN: What?
SAM: Wow.

388
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:26.850 line:15%
TRAVIS: No?

389
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:31.148 line:15%
Something we do in Port Damali, it's like a dock call.

390
00:15:31.148 --> 00:15:35.252 line:15%
You're like, "Had a good voyage today, can I get a haay?"

391
00:15:35.252 --> 00:15:37.645 line:15%
And all the ships are like, "Haay!"

392
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:38.553 line:15%
TALIESIN: Huh.

393
00:15:38.553 --> 00:15:40.017 line:15%
TRAVIS: It's a really unifying thing,

394
00:15:40.017 --> 00:15:41.730
you know, union workers and stuff.

395
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.440
LAURA: I heard them do that in Nicodranas as well.

396
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.630
TRAVIS: See?
LAURA: Yeah.

397
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.463
TRAVIS: Truth.

398
00:15:46.463 --> 00:15:47.890
TALIESIN: Hey.

399
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.883
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah, hey.

400
00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:51.083
SAM: Hey.
TALIESIN: Hey.

401
00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.360
LIAM: So we're taking a rest.

402
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.085
SAM: Sure, but we need to be on guard, on watch.

403
00:15:56.085 --> 00:15:58.297
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:15:58.297 --> 00:16:00.450
Let's all take a short rest back to back

405
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.570
and keep an eye out.

406
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.580
SAM: Great idea.
TRAVIS: Great, yep.

407
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.107
MARISHA: I'm good, so I'm going to do some investigating.

408
00:16:08.107 --> 00:16:09.463
SAM: Ooh.

409
00:16:09.463 --> 00:16:12.841
MARISHA: I'm going to see if I can find any carvings,

410
00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:17.250
any writing, any script on the walls, anything.

411
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.850
MATT: Inside the mirror chamber?

412
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.620
MARISHA: No no, in the angel chamber.

413
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.897
MATT: Oh, you mean the space between
the barrier and that angel doorway?

414
00:16:26.897 --> 00:16:29.213
Okay, go ahead and make an investigation check.

415
00:16:29.213 --> 00:16:30.600
LIAM: Celestial foyer.

416
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.710
MATT: If you will, yes, an antechamber.

417
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.810
MARISHA: All right.

418
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.571
17.

419
00:16:37.571 --> 00:16:38.770
MATT: Okay.

420
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:39.603
17.

421
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.170
Looking among the walls of this small, maybe ten-foot gap

422
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.198
between the two barriers,

423
00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.945
the stone is much like the previous chamber,

424
00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:55.820
it's been hewn and smoothed, but not to a perfect level.

425
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.499
It's a bit rough and warped in places,

426
00:16:58.499 --> 00:17:02.140
but it doesn't have any jagged edges to it.

427
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.870
You don't see any particular symbols or writing

428
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.340
that calls your attention

429
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.143
within this chamber, unfortunately.

430
00:17:10.143 --> 00:17:11.200
MARISHA: <i>This</i> chamber.

431
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.057
LAURA: I'm going to keep watching.

432
00:17:13.057 --> 00:17:14.830
Yeah, we should look at the mirror thing

433
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.864
because that angel is weeping.

434
00:17:16.864 --> 00:17:17.697
(gasps)

435
00:17:17.697 --> 00:17:20.160
Oh my god, what if the wall opened up on the other side?

436
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.909
MARISHA: You mean the--

437
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:24.275
TRAVIS: You mean in the mirror realm?

438
00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:25.680
LAURA: Yeah.

439
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.371
TRAVIS: That figures.

440
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.385
ASHLEY: The ice thing?

441
00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:33.475
TRAVIS: If nobody else needs a short rest,

442
00:17:33.475 --> 00:17:35.593
it might not hurt to go look at all the mirrors either,

443
00:17:35.593 --> 00:17:37.305
make sure something hasn't changed.

444
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.390
SAM: All right, well I could--
LAURA: I'll go with you.

445
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.398
SAM: Okay. We'll go together.

446
00:17:42.398 --> 00:17:43.380
LAURA: Okay.

447
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.210
MATT: All right, so what do the two of you do?

448
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.330
SAM: We're going back to the mirror room and--

449
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.110
LAURA: And looking and seeing for changes and stuff.

450
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.943
MATT: Okay.

451
00:17:50.943 --> 00:17:52.090
You approach the nearest mirror

452
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.150
and reach out and it's solid.

453
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.790
LAURA: Oh no, I couldn't get through before.

454
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.415
SAM: I couldn't either.

455
00:17:57.415 --> 00:18:00.190
LAURA: We're maybe the worst people to do this, then.

456
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.570
SAM: Well, we're very perceptive. Well, you are, anyway.

457
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.030
Let's just make a once around.

458
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.310
LAURA: Okay.

459
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.600
SAM: So we're going to go all around the room.

460
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.049
LAURA: And touch every mirror.

461
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:13.440
MATT: (short presses)

462
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.630
As you're making your pass, you get about half

463
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.310
of the chamber checked and all the mirrors are solid.

464
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.340
None are letting you pass.

465
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.280
LAURA: Maybe it closed the door.

466
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.130
SAM: Yeah, maybe it was active when the knife thing

467
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.760
was in the handle and not now.

468
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.050
LAURA: Maybe.

469
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.483
MATT: You get the sense from watching

470
00:18:31.483 --> 00:18:33.133
what had transpired here as well,

471
00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:37.000
the mirrors seem to be a one-way activation.

472
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.990
LAURA: Oh right, somebody has to be

473
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.840
on the other side to pull us through.

474
00:18:40.938 --> 00:18:42.850
And nobody's on the other side now.

475
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.850
SAM: That makes sense.

476
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.200
Oh well.

477
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.340
LAURA: Maybe somebody should've stayed on the other side.

478
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.570
SAM: Yeah, you're right.

479
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.900
Well no, wait, but then we don't want someone to stay.

480
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.248
There's no reason to go there anymore, right?

481
00:18:55.248 --> 00:18:56.970
LAURA: (unsure) Mm-mm.

482
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.200
SAM: Anyway, I think it's fine.

483
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.790
Hey, Jess.

484
00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.623
LAURA: Yeah?

485
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.195
SAM: You seen my flask?

486
00:19:06.464 --> 00:19:08.210
LAURA: The one you always drink from?

487
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.910
SAM: The only flask I ever drink from, that's right.

488
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.230
LAURA: Is it the one that's got a lot of alcohol,

489
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.920
the like endless alcohol in it?

490
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.328
SAM: Yes, the one that defines me as a person.

491
00:19:17.328 --> 00:19:18.161
Yes, that one.

492
00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:20.400
LAURA: I wouldn't say it defines you as a person.

493
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.690
I think you are defined by many other things.

494
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.060
SAM: Sure, but you know the one I'm speaking of.

495
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.893
Have you seen it?

496
00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:27.980
It's the one that I always have on me.

497
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.150
LAURA: I have Not(t).

498
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.983
SAM: You have?

499
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.660
LAURA: I have Not(t).

500
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.230
SAM: You have.

501
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.370
LAURA: Yes, I have.

502
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.203
SAM: What?

503
00:19:37.203 --> 00:19:38.330
LAURA: I have.

504
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:39.180
SAM: You've seen it?

505
00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.938
Where is it, who has it?

506
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.460
LAURA: I have it.

507
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.100
SAM: <i>You</i> have it?

508
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.625
LAURA: Yeah.

509
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.450
SAM: Well...

510
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.900
Why?

511
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.770
LAURA: Well, because you were, like, always drunk,

512
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.610
and you also, like, were doing some weird things,

513
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.070
and it made me really nervous for you.

514
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.910
And I thought that maybe, you know,

515
00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.620
you would have a clear head if you didn't have it.

516
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.420
And then you would realize that you didn't need it

517
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.800
because you had a clear head and then you would go,

518
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.740
"Oh my gosh, thank you so much, Jester,

519
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.321
"for taking it from me."

520
00:20:24.321 --> 00:20:27.520
SAM: You didn't think you could talk to me about that?

521
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.240
LAURA: Well, at the time you were pretty drunk.

522
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.310
SAM: I'm always drunk, we've talked--

523
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.740
LAURA: Well no, you're not now.

524
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.950
SAM: I don't like now.

525
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.980
LAURA: Well, but think about how clear

526
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.320
we're talking right now, Nott.

527
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.460
SAM: I feel like we talk like this all the time.

528
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.490
LAURA: Well, kind of, but usually like your eyes

529
00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.430
are going like this.

530
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.840
SAM: There's a lot to see in the world.

531
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.030
It's a very amazing place.

532
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.930
Listen, you might be enjoying this conversation

533
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.420
but I am not.

534
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.603
LAURA: You <i>are</i> Not(t)!

535
00:20:54.603 --> 00:20:56.585
(Travis laughs)

536
00:20:56.585 --> 00:20:58.227
SAM: This is confusing.

537
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.420
I haven't felt like myself in days now.

538
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.470
And I don't like it.

539
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.480
And I'm sad that you couldn't talk to me about this.

540
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.310
LAURA: I'm sorry.

541
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.023
SAM: Well, I'll forgive you if you give me back my flask.

542
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.177
LAURA: I will not(t).

543
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.140
SAM: Will you?

544
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.973
(Travis chuckles)

545
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.620
LAURA: I will.

546
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.290
But I want you to think

547
00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.707
about the fact that, you know...

548
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.540
Well, I would say you're doing so much better

549
00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.620
without it, but you're not.

550
00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.170
You jumped off a fucking bridge.

551
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.450
I had to chase after you, you almost died.

552
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.000
SAM: I am a bundle of nerves right now.

553
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.980
The whole time we've been coming down here--

554
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.050
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
SAM: It's dark, it's scary.

555
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.410
I'm scared.
LAURA: Fine, fine, fine.

556
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.360
SAM: And I'm thinking about things.

557
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.177
And I don't want to think about things.

558
00:21:59.177 --> 00:22:00.860
I don't want to think about anything.

559
00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.430
I just want to be on an adventure with you guys

560
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.020
and that's all I want and I don't want to think

561
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.628
about anything else past that.

562
00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.662
LAURA: Life can be hard.

563
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.453
And it is.

564
00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.430
You have a husband and a son who loves you very much.

565
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.520
SAM: I love them, too.

566
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.830
LAURA: And they want you alive.

567
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.190
And sometimes when you're drinking this,

568
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.820
you don't look for traps.

569
00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.429
Or when you do, you trigger them.

570
00:22:33.429 --> 00:22:36.012
(laughter)

571
00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.607
SAM: Well, nobody's perfect.

572
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.160
LAURA: It's just that, you know,

573
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.520
they rely on you and we do too and...

574
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.587
SAM: I know, but I don't know if...

575
00:22:55.489 --> 00:22:57.740
I can't have everyone relying on me, right?

576
00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.860
LAURA: Well no, I mean, you can rely on me too

577
00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.100
and we can rely on Caleb and we can rely on--

578
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.330
SAM: I'm just scared, that's all.

579
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.705
I'm scared of (sighs)

580
00:23:09.705 --> 00:23:13.040
I'm scared of what happens next.

581
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.943
You know?

582
00:23:13.943 --> 00:23:16.760
I don't know what's going to happen after this.

583
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.860
I found my husband.

584
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.740
I found my son.

585
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.818
And I want to go back with them so much.

586
00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:25.651
LAURA: Yeah.

587
00:23:25.651 --> 00:23:30.259
SAM: But I'm worried that if I go back,

588
00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:33.383
that'll be it.

589
00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.970
LAURA: It doesn't have to be.

590
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.940
Hell, we might not make it back, you know?

591
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.170
Nobody knows what's going to happen.

592
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.220
I worry that we got my mom in trouble and,

593
00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.360
you know, somebody's going to go find her

594
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.030
because of things we did and, you know,

595
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.810
she could be hurt right now.

596
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.900
Or even if she's not, we might not ever get out of here

597
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.450
and we might not ever get back to Nicodranas.

598
00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.850
SAM: We have to get back to your family.

599
00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:05.850
I want to get back to mine, but I don't know.

600
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.578
Sometimes it's just easier to...

601
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.590
LAURA: Escape?

602
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.840
SAM: Mm-hmm.

603
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.375
LAURA: Yeah.

604
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.930
SAM: I'll think about what you said.

605
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:23.388
Maybe I'll try not to drink

606
00:24:23.388 --> 00:24:25.440
<i>all</i> day.

607
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.650
Maybe I can start with baby steps and only drink

608
00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:33.110
between the hours of like, what do you suggest?

609
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.820
LAURA: Maybe like between the time we camp

610
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.980
and like the time we go to sleep only.

611
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.230
SAM: Oh wow, that is a short interval.

612
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.490
I was thinking like 11:00am to 11:00pm.

613
00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:46.900
LAURA: That's the whole day.

614
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.733
SAM: It's not the morning.

615
00:24:47.733 --> 00:24:50.460
It's not right when you wake up, you know?

616
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.293
It's like--

617
00:24:51.293 --> 00:24:54.198
LAURA: What if we find a trap at, like, 1:00?

618
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.090
SAM: I might set it off.
LAURA: Yeah.

619
00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.960
SAM and LAURA: Yeah.

620
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.320
LAURA: And then we could all die.

621
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.850
SAM: Especially me.
LAURA: Yeah.

622
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.110
You'd be the closest.

623
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.330
And a lot of times, I'm standing next to you.

624
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.806
So is Caleb and he's squishy.

625
00:25:08.806 --> 00:25:10.890
SAM: Yes, he's very handsome though.

626
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.140
LAURA: He is, he's very handsome. He shaved.

627
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.973
SAM: I saw.

628
00:25:13.973 --> 00:25:15.470
LAURA: He has a nice chin.
SAM: He does.

629
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.853
A little cleft in it.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

630
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.320
SAM: All right, I'll compromise.
LAURA: Okay.

631
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.530
SAM: 11:30 to 11 to start.

632
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.333
LAURA: <i>Nott!</i>

633
00:25:29.225 --> 00:25:31.230
(Sam chuckles)

634
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.872
SAM: I can't stay mad at you.

635
00:25:32.872 --> 00:25:35.350
(both giggling)

636
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.630
Give me my flask or I'll kill you.

637
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:37.568
Oh thank you.
LAURA: All right, all right.

638
00:25:37.568 --> 00:25:38.940
I love you, I love you.

639
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.300
Just think about it, okay?

640
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.610
SAM: I will think about it, I promise.

641
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.630
LAURA: Okay.

642
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:47.200
And hey, if, you know, you feel like you really need it

643
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.330
or something, just tell me and I can cast,

644
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.740
like, a restoration spell on you or something

645
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.130
and maybe, you know, you'll feel better.

646
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.800
SAM: Wait, I can get as drunk as I want

647
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.210
and then when I want to un-drunk--

648
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.645
LAURA: No, I'm not going to waste my spells like that.

649
00:25:59.645 --> 00:26:00.770
SAM: But you could.

650
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.330
LAURA: I don't know if it works like that.

651
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.127
I was saying if you have like a hangover or something--

652
00:26:04.127 --> 00:26:05.950
SAM: Only one way to find out.

653
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.941
LAURA: I don't like this plan.

654
00:26:06.941 --> 00:26:09.230
(Sam cackles)

655
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.600
This is the worst.

656
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.729
SAM: It's 11:30 somewhere, let's go back.

657
00:26:13.729 --> 00:26:16.396
(Matt chuckles)

658
00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:18.362
MATT: All right.

659
00:26:18.362 --> 00:26:21.350
In the meantime, anyone else doing anything specifically?

660
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.900
MARISHA: Keep searching for stuff if I can.

661
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.120
MATT: Okay, I mean--
MARISHA: Not finding things.

662
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.710
MATT: Well, what else are you looking for?

663
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.586
MARISHA: I don't know.

664
00:26:32.586 --> 00:26:35.169
(laughter)

665
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:40.300
I'm supposed to be good at investigating and I suck at it.

666
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.970
MATT: No, you're very good at it.

667
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.050
LIAM: Why are you making so much noise over here?

668
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.010
What are you looking for?

669
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.780
MARISHA: Fucking answers.

670
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.442
LIAM: The answers?

671
00:26:50.658 --> 00:26:52.548
MARISHA: Is there a mechanism?

672
00:26:52.548 --> 00:26:55.013
How is it crying? Why is it crying?

673
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.690
MATT: You want to investigate the door?

674
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.970
MARISHA: Why are the angels crying?

675
00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.350
TRAVIS: The statue?
MARISHA: The statue.

676
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.830
MATT: Yeah, I'll carry over your investigation roll there.

677
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.102
You go ahead and inspect it and it's a very slow trickle.

678
00:27:07.102 --> 00:27:12.002
Glancing at it, there isn't a particular

679
00:27:13.135 --> 00:27:14.870
mechanism that you can find.

680
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.730
There is a slight gap underneath the eye

681
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.310
where the blood seems to come from,

682
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.540
but you're not certain if the mechanism here

683
00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:28.228
is mechanical or enchantment-based.

684
00:27:28.228 --> 00:27:29.886
It's a strange--

685
00:27:31.324 --> 00:27:33.532
It's a strange thing.

686
00:27:39.014 --> 00:27:39.847
SAM: It's weird.

687
00:27:39.847 --> 00:27:41.725
MARISHA: Fucking hate not knowing shit.

688
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.260
LIAM: Can we get a sense of how old these things are?

689
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.110
I can't remember if we've done that in the past game.

690
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.740
MATT: I mean, based on the conversation

691
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.270
that you had had with the angel and...

692
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.287
Make a history check.

693
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:01.863
LIAM: 19.

694
00:28:01.863 --> 00:28:04.210
MATT: 19?
LIAM: Yeah.

695
00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.080
MATT: Some of the iconography, the discussion based

696
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.090
on the history of Bazzoxan, the conversation

697
00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.250
with the angel skull, you get the sense

698
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.770
this place is Pre-Calamity, as is a lot of things

699
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.270
in this area of Xhorhas that haven't been built recently

700
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.370
by the Kryn Dynasty.

701
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.830
LIAM: And no writing, Beauregard, you would have found it.

702
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.710
There's no writing on this door

703
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.380
or these bells or musical tone devices?

704
00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.380
MATT: Not specifically in this section, no.

705
00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.030
LIAM: Well, maybe we have just run out of road here.

706
00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.630
Maybe we need to gather our things and go in.

707
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.550
I figured out that whip.

708
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.260
MARISHA: What's the whip?

709
00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.514
LIAM: Well, I can't use it.

710
00:28:39.514 --> 00:28:41.990
It's best in somebody's...

711
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.823
Where is everybody?

712
00:28:42.823 --> 00:28:43.880
They're all here, you're all here?

713
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.270
MATT: You guys are all still mostly gathered.

714
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.340
TALIESIN: I'm sitting, keeping an eye on the way forward.

715
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.730
Just keeping an ear--

716
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.510
TRAVIS: Scratch a little design into my armor.

717
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.810
LIAM: It's very cool, but I can't use it.

718
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.560
It would be best in the hands of someone very strong.

719
00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.510
So I would imagine one of you two ladies, if you want.

720
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.810
Maybe you, because you're always like,

721
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.410
bip, bip, bip, doing many things.

722
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.243
So maybe for you.

723
00:29:06.243 --> 00:29:10.260
What it does is it will grab a hold of your foe

724
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.350
from quite a ways away and restrain them,

725
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.950
pull them toward you.

726
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.040
But I can tell just by the heft of it

727
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.530
that it needs some muscle.

728
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:22.829
So, you know, look at me.

729
00:29:22.829 --> 00:29:24.462
Weep!

730
00:29:27.112 --> 00:29:28.210
LAURA: I mean, I can...

731
00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:29.920
Would I be able to pull it

732
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.933
and then yank it towards somebody else?

733
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.520
LIAM: You'd have to experiment with it.

734
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.520
I don't know, I'm not really a whip master.

735
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.670
MARISHA: It's a very long whip.

736
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.475
LIAM: I was a good debater in school, but...

737
00:29:41.475 --> 00:29:42.850
ASHLEY: Were you a master debater?

738
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:44.780
LIAM: Some would say.

739
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.840
ASHLEY: Oh, I've heard about those.

740
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.200
TRAVIS: Can I see your palms?

741
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.300
MARISHA: You're like a...

742
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.780
LAURA: Let me see the whip.

743
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.410
TALIESIN: Really dole out some punishment with that whip.

744
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.320
LAURA: How's it feel?

745
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.610
MATT: It feels pretty hefty.

746
00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.003
It's got a nice weight to it.

747
00:29:58.003 --> 00:29:59.730
LAURA: It's hefty.

748
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.071
It's got a nice weight to it.

749
00:30:01.071 --> 00:30:03.540
(laughter)

750
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.180
ASHLEY: Can you use it with other things, though?

751
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.570
SAM: Oh, like in one hand while you've got a sword?

752
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.510
LAURA: Oh, you've got a two-handed weapon, too.

753
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.850
TRAVIS: Jester, I think this has your name all over it.

754
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.880
ASHLEY: Jester, I think that...

755
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.020
TRAVIS: How often do you hit things with your handaxe?

756
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.853
LAURA: Like, never.

757
00:30:19.853 --> 00:30:21.519
TRAVIS: Yeah. Might as well have it.

758
00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:23.630
LIAM: I think that's more useful than your axe.

759
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.650
TRAVIS: Restrained as in, like, grapple?

760
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.390
MATT: You can choose.

761
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.460
It grapples...

762
00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.293
But you can use an action

763
00:30:29.293 --> 00:30:31.630
to attack something at a 20-foot reach.

764
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.420
It's a very long whip.

765
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.700
If it hits, you choose to either restrain them.

766
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.220
Like they become grappled as part of that.

767
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.190
You can choose to restrain them as part of the grapple,

768
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.929
or you can pull them 20 feet towards you.

769
00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:47.340
It can also be used on objects.

770
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.770
LAURA: Whoa!

771
00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.320
MATT: To pull objects towards you or you towards objects.

772
00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.760
TRAVIS: Oh shit, Indiana Jones!

773
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.860
LAURA: I love this.

774
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.400
LIAM: It could maybe work for you

775
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.710
because you do so many things--

776
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.520
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I'm putting it on my belt right now.

777
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.700
MARISHA: I can move pretty fast.

778
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.525
ASHLEY: I love it, but this feels like...

779
00:31:04.525 --> 00:31:05.833
MATT: (rapid whip cracking)

780
00:31:05.833 --> 00:31:08.666
TRAVIS: ♪ (Indiana Jones theme) ♪

781
00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:12.120
LAURA: Is there anything up high that I can hit it with,

782
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.564
that I can wrap it around?

783
00:31:14.564 --> 00:31:15.897
MATT: Make a perception check.

784
00:31:15.897 --> 00:31:17.980
(laughs)

785
00:31:19.982 --> 00:31:21.080
LAURA: Oh!

786
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.050
SAM: Nice!

787
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:22.900
MATT: That was a journey.

788
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.620
LIAM: The longest roll of the show.

789
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.680
LAURA: It was still pretty good.

790
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.250
Yeah, 20--

791
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.720
23.

792
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.430
MATT: Okay, glancing near the entryway

793
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.060
where you guys first came in, there is a faint aspect

794
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.550
of an archway where you can see there's a little

795
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.890
groove on top and a little space between

796
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.270
where some of the stone has fallen away,

797
00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.178
there's a slight gap.

798
00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:46.678
SAM: (whip crack)

799
00:31:46.678 --> 00:31:48.090
LAURA: And I pull myself up towards it.

800
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.870
MATT: Okay, you go ahead and wrap around.

801
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.520
As you invoke the whip, it seems to retract

802
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.450
and like a reverse rubber band,

803
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.490
pull you through the air towards it.

804
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.323
LAURA: Whoa!

805
00:31:59.323 --> 00:32:02.057
MATT: You can either choose to grab onto it or just fall.

806
00:32:02.057 --> 00:32:03.391
LAURA: I'm going to grab onto it.

807
00:32:03.391 --> 00:32:05.610
MATT: You leap about at an angle about 20 feet up

808
00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.443
and then catch yourself.

809
00:32:06.443 --> 00:32:08.781
You're now hanging about five feet off the ground.

810
00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:10.568
Your feet dangling.

811
00:32:10.568 --> 00:32:11.680
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Whoa.

812
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.530
LAURA: This is the coolest thing ever.

813
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.400
Caleb, thank you.

814
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.086
LIAM: Oh, sure.

815
00:32:18.086 --> 00:32:19.820
LAURA: I'm just going to stay here for awhile, guys.

816
00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.840
I'll keep looking around.

817
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.850
TRAVIS: There's a spider on your head.

818
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:23.941
LAURA: Cool.

819
00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:25.020
(laughter)

820
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:25.853
TRAVIS: Whoa.

821
00:32:25.853 --> 00:32:28.090
LIAM: I walk over and push her by the shoe.

822
00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.837
SAM: No up-skirt paintings, anyone.

823
00:32:30.837 --> 00:32:32.050
LAURA: I wear pants.
SAM: Oh.

824
00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:34.359
LAURA: Under my dress.

825
00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:36.422
(Matt chuckles)

826
00:32:36.422 --> 00:32:37.255
MATT: All right.

827
00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:39.870
Anything else anyone wants to do in this area?

828
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.703
MARISHA: No, let's go.

829
00:32:40.703 --> 00:32:42.030
LIAM: Has the short rest ended?

830
00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.830
MATT: Short rest is an hour, so if...

831
00:32:45.138 --> 00:32:45.971
LIAM: I don't think I got it, but...

832
00:32:45.971 --> 00:32:46.804
ASHLEY: I was hurting.

833
00:32:46.804 --> 00:32:47.637
MARISHA: Yasha.

834
00:32:47.637 --> 00:32:48.910
MATT: I'd say because you were casting a spell,

835
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:49.743
you could take a short rest,

836
00:32:49.743 --> 00:32:51.182
but you'd have to wait an additional ten minutes.

837
00:32:51.182 --> 00:32:53.060
LIAM: Eh.
MATT: Okay.

838
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.906
So the short rest is complete.

839
00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:56.958
MARISHA: You all right?

840
00:32:56.958 --> 00:33:00.552
You're staring at the wall a little bit.

841
00:33:01.741 --> 00:33:03.101
ASHLEY: I think so.

842
00:33:03.101 --> 00:33:07.950
I think I just, I'm ready to figure out what this place is

843
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.241
and what's going on and

844
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:14.300
just have some answers, you know?

845
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.430
TRAVIS: Nothing's familiar at all?

846
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.850
Not that it would be, but...

847
00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.860
ASHLEY: No, I don't think I've ever been here before.

848
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.240
So I don't...

849
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.170
None of this is familiar to me.

850
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.300
LIAM: You know, you are often on the front line with us,

851
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.590
but might I suggest you stick to the middle right now?

852
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.132
ASHLEY: I don't know if I feel comfortable with that.

853
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.840
LIAM: A little protection is not a terrible thing.

854
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.343
ASHLEY: It can be.

855
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.970
I would like to be in the front, if that's okay.

856
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.962
LIAM: The choice is yours.

857
00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.462
ASHLEY: I think I'm just, I'm tired of being in the middle

858
00:34:01.924 --> 00:34:03.150
and not being able to do anything.

859
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:07.341
So if it's okay with you guys,

860
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:12.341
I would like to be in front.

861
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.368
LAURA: Lead the way, Yasha.

862
00:34:14.368 --> 00:34:15.920
SAM: Fine by me.
TRAVIS: Be proud to follow you.

863
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.450
MARISHA: I'm right behind ya.

864
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:18.466
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Real quick,

865
00:34:18.466 --> 00:34:19.682
because we're in the room.

866
00:34:19.682 --> 00:34:20.524
MATT: Yes.

867
00:34:20.524 --> 00:34:23.970
TRAVIS: For an hour now, any new tracks in this room

868
00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:26.590
that do not belong to us?

869
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.598
MATT: Make a survival check.

870
00:34:32.826 --> 00:34:35.960
TRAVIS: Oof. Seven.

871
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.478
MATT: It's hard to tell in this chamber.

872
00:34:37.478 --> 00:34:38.570
I mean, there's a lot of dust that got kicked up

873
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:39.940
and around by you guys in the middle

874
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.110
of trying to inspect the place and dealing

875
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.210
with the musical entryway and the shifting of the barrier.

876
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.070
Your eyes don't pick up anything one way or the other.

877
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.300
TRAVIS: I would remind us all of one thing.

878
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.010
Remember, we were following tracks up to that barrier.

879
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.990
None were on the other side.

880
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:57.940
So whoever was here before us, possibly recently,

881
00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.120
did not open that door.

882
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.710
We have.

883
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.680
In case we didn't see them on the way through,

884
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.940
just want to make sure no one's in here with us,

885
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.910
has gone through, or is behind us.

886
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.380
TALIESIN: Are there tracks on in the inside

887
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.560
going towards where we're going?

888
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.460
Are there footprints already leading down?

889
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:18.272
MATT: He just made a tracking check and didn't see anything.

890
00:35:18.272 --> 00:35:19.460
If you want to make a survival check.

891
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.470
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'll join in.

892
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:23.880
Not much better, ten.

893
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.427
MATT: Ten.

894
00:35:25.427 --> 00:35:27.010
Not picking up anything really one way or the other.

895
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.500
Nothing catches your eye.

896
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.333
LIAM: While they look around,

897
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:30.599
I'm going to retract what I said.

898
00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:34.130
I am going to lay out for another ten or 15 minutes.

899
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.200
MATT: Okay, what are you doing?

900
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.817
LIAM: Arcane Recovery.

901
00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.730
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: To achieve that short rest

902
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.300
like the others did.
MATT: Okay, got you.

903
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.960
So you guys hang for an additional 15 minutes

904
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.960
past the hour-long short rest.

905
00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.430
So he can go ahead and recover a little bit

906
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.550
of his arcane knowledge.

907
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.500
ASHLEY: Do I see anything looking ahead into the room?

908
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.000
MATT: Your darkvision, which I believe normally

909
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.330
extends to 60 feet, is still reduced to 30.

910
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.980
The curse of this locale

911
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.740
seems to limit vision and light.

912
00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.590
That 30-foot range, the hallway just continues.

913
00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.670
You can see the stonework going instead

914
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.270
from that smooth hewn stone

915
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.310
to intentional brick at the very cusp,

916
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.480
stone bricks that are layered

917
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.850
and built on both sides of the wall.

918
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:22.480
Going from the smooth interior to a constructed interior,

919
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.780
but that's the extent of your visual range

920
00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.330
from where you guys are waiting.

921
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.730
ASHLEY: Can I check for tracks going in there as well?

922
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.733
MATT: Unfortunately, everyone's already kind of--

923
00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:35.959
Kind of pushed into the track rolls.

924
00:36:35.959 --> 00:36:37.340
TRAVIS: Sorry.
MATT: It's all good.

925
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.915
TRAVIS: My fault.

926
00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:41.184
MATT: But yeah.

927
00:36:42.522 --> 00:36:45.900
MARISHA: Well, any other prep we need to do before we go in?

928
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.133
SAM: Let's go.

929
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.821
TRAVIS: Anybody got any glass vials, beakers,

930
00:36:51.821 --> 00:36:52.654
anything like that?

931
00:36:52.654 --> 00:36:53.670
SAM: I do.

932
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.611
TRAVIS: Want to smash one of those up

933
00:36:55.611 --> 00:36:56.527
in a little piece of cloth

934
00:36:56.527 --> 00:36:58.910
and just scatter it on the floor behind us?

935
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.590
Just in case we walk in and somebody steps on it.

936
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.310
I say this quietly.

937
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:05.730
SAM: It's very small.

938
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.850
I mean, we have a thousand ball bearings, don't we?

939
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.010
LAURA: Yeah, but this would make noise.

940
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.660
TRAVIS: Yeah, like (crackling) if they stepped on it.

941
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.340
SAM: I have like a chemist's bottle.

942
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.030
Let me see what else I have.

943
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.090
LAURA: Yeah, that might be perfect.

944
00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:17.923
Just enough to--

945
00:37:17.923 --> 00:37:20.008
TRAVIS: Saw it in this play called Impossible Mission.

946
00:37:20.008 --> 00:37:20.841
It was great.

947
00:37:20.841 --> 00:37:22.807
(chuckling)

948
00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.590
LIAM: Yasha.

949
00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:29.260
Would you allow me again to, and I start to trace

950
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.470
the same angles through the air and cast Gift of Alacrity

951
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:34.303
on you again.

952
00:37:34.303 --> 00:37:38.690
So initiative, for next eight hours.

953
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.560
LAURA: Nice.

954
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.690
ASHLEY: Thank you, Caleb.

955
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.310
LAURA: Can I take an empty healing bottle,

956
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.500
healing potion bottle, and get some of the blood

957
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.590
that's dripping and put it in the bottle?

958
00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.590
MATT: Sure, yeah, you can definitely do that.

959
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.423
It takes a little bit.

960
00:37:50.423 --> 00:37:51.590
It's not like a serious rush.

961
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.470
It's just a very slow trickle.

962
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.720
So you have to take some time while you're resting

963
00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.140
and waiting for Caleb to finish to go ahead

964
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.350
and fill some of the vial, but it's doable, yeah.

965
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.870
LAURA: Does it feel like there's a thrumming coming

966
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.650
from this one, too?

967
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.492
MATT: Not a thrumming necessarily.

968
00:38:10.492 --> 00:38:12.470
Are you feeling for the music, you mean?

969
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:13.820
LAURA: Yeah.

970
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.420
MATT: You put your ear to it.

971
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.510
There is a faint music to it.

972
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:18.440
Connects it to the other ones

973
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.040
that you've listened to before, yeah.

974
00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.350
LAURA: Yasha.

975
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:23.656
ASHLEY: Yeah?

976
00:38:23.656 --> 00:38:26.106
LAURA: Did you ever put your ear to this?

977
00:38:26.106 --> 00:38:26.939
ASHLEY: I did.

978
00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:28.820
I put it to the back when we were down there

979
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.080
but I want to hear it again.

980
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.932
LAURA: Put it in, it's playing the music again.

981
00:38:34.932 --> 00:38:35.765
ASHLEY: Give it a listen.

982
00:38:35.765 --> 00:38:37.560
MATT: The same tune.

983
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.080
Same seven notes in repetition.

984
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.641
Just the soft droning progression.

985
00:38:43.641 --> 00:38:45.028
LAURA and ASHLEY: ♪ (Girl from Ipanema) ♪

986
00:38:45.028 --> 00:38:46.410
(laughs)

987
00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.714
ASHLEY: Sounds familiar.

988
00:38:48.714 --> 00:38:50.130
MATT: Ah.

989
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.020
Intermission.

990
00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.123
No.

991
00:38:52.123 --> 00:38:54.240
(laughter)

992
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.350
So you guys have rested up.

993
00:38:57.350 --> 00:39:01.603
You've inspected the whip and ascertained its nature.

994
00:39:01.603 --> 00:39:04.110
Is there anything else you wish to do at this juncture?

995
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.350
SAM: Hell no, let's go.

996
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.808
TRAVIS: Yasha. Lead the way.

997
00:39:07.808 --> 00:39:08.841
ASHLEY: Okay.

998
00:39:08.841 --> 00:39:09.780
MATT: Okay.

999
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.770
ASHLEY: Is everybody ready?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1000
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:13.960
MATT: Okay.

1001
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.920
What's the marching order, by the way?

1002
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.080
LAURA: Well, Yasha.

1003
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.310
MATT: Yasha up front, perfect.

1004
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.340
MARISHA: I'm going to be behind Yasha.

1005
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.560
TRAVIS: I'll be behind Beau.

1006
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.910
LAURA: Wait, get a cleric up there.

1007
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:26.070
TALIESIN: I'll be behind Beau.
MATT: All right.

1008
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.540
So wait, so Caduceus behind Beau and then Fjord?

1009
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.860
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: All righty.

1010
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.693
Who's up next?

1011
00:39:30.693 --> 00:39:32.030
LIAM: There's no light source down here, right?

1012
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:33.295
MATT: No.
SAM: I'll be next.

1013
00:39:33.295 --> 00:39:34.480
MATT: None that you can see.

1014
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.642
Nott next, and then we have Caleb and Jester.

1015
00:39:35.642 --> 00:39:37.317
LAURA: I'll follow.

1016
00:39:37.317 --> 00:39:38.858
Do you want me to be in the back or?

1017
00:39:38.858 --> 00:39:40.580
LIAM: Yes, please.
LAURA: Okay.

1018
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.638
I'll be in the back, Caleb will be

1019
00:39:42.638 --> 00:39:44.597
in front of me.
MATT: You got it.

1020
00:39:44.597 --> 00:39:46.500
LIAM: Just switch those two.

1021
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.600
SAM: I take a big old fat swig of booze.

1022
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:54.490
MATT: You got it.

1023
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.800
LAURA: My shoulders slump.

1024
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.860
MATT: Aw.

1025
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.693
All righty.

1026
00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.190
Progressing onward for another 60 or so feet,

1027
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.550
you watch the tunnel, much like you had noticed,

1028
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:09.820
change texture into these like foot-high,

1029
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.645
two-foot wide stone bricks,

1030
00:40:12.645 --> 00:40:16.060
offset laid to create walls.

1031
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.420
The chamber itself, it's about 20 feet wide.

1032
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:24.420
Or the hallway, 20 feet wide, ten feet tall, just a walkway.

1033
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.670
Continuing on for a bit--

1034
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.568
MARISHA: Arched or just square flat?
MATT: Square.

1035
00:40:29.568 --> 00:40:31.320
MARISHA: Okay.

1036
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.490
MATT: Continuing onward for the extent

1037
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:38.842
of this tunnel, it opens up.

1038
00:40:38.842 --> 00:40:42.400
You can see railing

1039
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.520
on the right and left sides as you

1040
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.862
begin to push forward, Yasha,

1041
00:40:45.862 --> 00:40:50.862
and then a railing ahead of you across the way.

1042
00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.921
As the chamber opens up, you can see rail this way

1043
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:57.530
and then bits of railing here with a gap.

1044
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.770
It looks like a larger, dark chamber inside.

1045
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:04.029
You can see the very faint flickering of light.

1046
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.440
Like small, little light sources flickering.

1047
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.398
Just out of sight.

1048
00:41:10.398 --> 00:41:12.780
Do you continue on towards the end of the hall?

1049
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.420
SAM: Sure, yeah, sure.

1050
00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.790
LAURA: (nervous humming)

1051
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:18.340
ASHLEY: So...

1052
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:22.990
Railings on either side, yeah, it's like a T?

1053
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.823
MATT: Kind of.

1054
00:41:23.823 --> 00:41:26.320
The hallway continues and then it just opens up.

1055
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.080
The walls open into this space, like a cavern,

1056
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.913
or a room ahead of you.

1057
00:41:29.913 --> 00:41:31.540
TRAVIS: Like a railing, like once it opens up,

1058
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.373
there's a railing across from there.

1059
00:41:32.373 --> 00:41:34.110
MATT: There's a railing across it and railing on each side

1060
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.600
and then the chamber opens up below.

1061
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.110
It looks like it falls off.

1062
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:39.250
TRAVIS: And then whatever that is.

1063
00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:42.980
MARISHA: Anytime there's a walkway and a giant, open chasm,

1064
00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.980
it's bad news bears.

1065
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.831
SAM: Where else are we going to go?

1066
00:41:46.831 --> 00:41:47.664
MARISHA: Yeah.

1067
00:41:50.504 --> 00:41:51.680
TRAVIS: I just want to savor this moment.

1068
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.840
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too.

1069
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.620
While we're all still alive.

1070
00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.461
LIAM: I'm just going to take this moment to burn

1071
00:41:58.461 --> 00:42:01.870
a one 1st-level spell slot of transmutation magic,

1072
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.210
I have Feather Fall prepared just to shift

1073
00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.170
the transmutation stone back to being help

1074
00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.107
with concentration.

1075
00:42:10.107 --> 00:42:10.973
MATT: Concentration.

1076
00:42:10.973 --> 00:42:11.990
LIAM: Different property for the stone.

1077
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.390
MATT: Okay, you got it.

1078
00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.400
ASHLEY: Okay, I move forward.

1079
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.920
MATT: Okay.

1080
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.310
You come and as you're stepping forward,

1081
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.850
as the walls open up on each side,

1082
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.800
you can see two wide staircases that slowly spiral down

1083
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.170
into a larger chamber that is below,

1084
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.310
about 20 feet below you.

1085
00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:38.010
You can see candelabras

1086
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.520
affixed multiple points, torches across the way,

1087
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.310
torches to each right side that are gently flickering.

1088
00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.650
That's the only light source in this chamber.

1089
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.020
All the light is condensed.

1090
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.310
You can see what you would expect to be the radius,

1091
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:54.472
once again, also choked by the locale.

1092
00:42:54.472 --> 00:42:56.070
LIAM: What does a blind human see?

1093
00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.680
I'm just holding onto Nott's shoulder.

1094
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.763
MATT: Right.

1095
00:42:58.763 --> 00:43:00.060
Well, you see darkness other

1096
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:03.197
than the sources of the firelight.

1097
00:43:03.197 --> 00:43:05.160
So you see like little flickering candles.

1098
00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:05.993
LIAM: Okay.

1099
00:43:05.993 --> 00:43:10.310
MATT: So you see the candelabra

1100
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.176
and a little bit of light in the distance.

1101
00:43:12.176 --> 00:43:14.700
You still can't make out the extent of it.

1102
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.180
What little bit of light that's coming through

1103
00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.330
that's giving off and is being choked is making visible

1104
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:23.880
a slight shape in the center of the floor down below.

1105
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.390
MARISHA: What's the shape?

1106
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.170
MATT: Make a perception check.

1107
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.842
Both of you, since you guys are at the front.

1108
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.540
LAURA: I'm in the back.

1109
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.930
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1110
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.340
ASHLEY: What what.
TRAVIS: Yes.

1111
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.440
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Hell yeah, 15.

1112
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.490
MATT: 15, okay.
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, bros.

1113
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:45.420
MATT: At this distance at the edge of the railing,

1114
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.310
it's hard to make out the details.

1115
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:50.660
You, however, squint, goggles on, focus out,

1116
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.530
and you can see the candelabras

1117
00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.610
are at the four corners of this slightly stepped,

1118
00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.110
raised platform that goes up about five feet.

1119
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:03.676
There is a wide stone slab

1120
00:44:03.676 --> 00:44:06.220
about five feet high,

1121
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.080
ten feet on each side.

1122
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.832
Looks kind of like a sarcophagus.

1123
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.630
ASHLEY: Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

1124
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.340
LAURA: Kind of. It kind of looks.

1125
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.486
MARISHA: I pass it down the line.

1126
00:44:19.486 --> 00:44:21.400
TRAVIS: Are there any tracks amongst our feet?

1127
00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.524
Anything fresh?

1128
00:44:23.524 --> 00:44:24.740
MATT: You're having a hard time picking up tracks, man.

1129
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.970
TRAVIS: Yeah, sorry, I'm just, you know,

1130
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.112
if I can, I got to quit shuffling.

1131
00:44:29.112 --> 00:44:31.220
MARISHA: The scripture at the front

1132
00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.250
said, "Let lie the King's instrument,

1133
00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:36.320
"deathless and detained, until the world ends."

1134
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.630
TRAVIS: Deathless.
MARISHA: And detained.

1135
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:40.463
TRAVIS: Oh god.

1136
00:44:40.463 --> 00:44:43.780
SAM: Well, we're going to make it deathful.

1137
00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.990
TRAVIS: Nott, are you okay?

1138
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.570
SAM: I'm great.

1139
00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:48.403
TRAVIS: Woo.

1140
00:44:49.265 --> 00:44:51.650
Have you been...
TALIESIN: What?

1141
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.330
SAM: I've been hitting the sauce.

1142
00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:55.178
MARISHA: Undead pings?

1143
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.350
TALIESIN: I feel like we're too far away.

1144
00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.887
I mean, I can't really see anything yet.

1145
00:45:02.975 --> 00:45:04.490
LAURA: Can you send some lights down there?

1146
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.440
You think that'd be bad idea?

1147
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.430
TRAVIS: Have we stepped out at least to the railing?

1148
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.040
MATT: You guys up at the railing now.

1149
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.940
TALIESIN: How far down does it go?

1150
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.430
MATT: It goes down about 20-so feet.

1151
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:18.950
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case, I'll do a ping then.

1152
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.580
MATT: Meaning to the floor and then the actual

1153
00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.430
this stone slab-like structure

1154
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:27.050
is maybe, hard to tell from this distance,

1155
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:30.030
but about 40 or 50 feet out from where you guys

1156
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.100
are standing at the edge.

1157
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.780
TALIESIN: I will do Eyes of the Grave, then.

1158
00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.613
MATT: Okay.

1159
00:45:33.613 --> 00:45:35.110
Close your eyes and focus.

1160
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.710
Nothing.

1161
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.510
TALIESIN: No undead within 60 feet?

1162
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:42.980
MATT: No, nothing within 60 feet.

1163
00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.260
TRAVIS: Above us?

1164
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.093
MATT: Above us?

1165
00:45:45.093 --> 00:45:48.170
The chamber, as it opens up,

1166
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.770
it opens up into a ceiling about five feet higher

1167
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.710
than the hallway you were in.

1168
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.270
But it's just this smooth--

1169
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:56.820
Make a perception check for me.

1170
00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:02.560
TRAVIS: (groans) God, ten.

1171
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.910
MATT: Okay.

1172
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:08.050
You see the roof is singular wide, arched ceiling.

1173
00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:10.710
You can just barely make out, with what little bit

1174
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.360
of light there is, there's designs on it,

1175
00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.100
but you can't tell anything from this distance

1176
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.080
in this low light.

1177
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.212
TRAVIS: Let's just head up there.

1178
00:46:20.212 --> 00:46:23.320
LAURA: If I put my hand on the wall, do I feel any kind of--

1179
00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.015
SAM: Thrumming?
LAURA: Yeah.

1180
00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:26.231
MATT: You put your hand on the wall.

1181
00:46:26.231 --> 00:46:28.294
Make a perception check.

1182
00:46:28.294 --> 00:46:30.340
TRAVIS: There's like drums and stuff.

1183
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.173
TALIESIN: A Volvo?

1184
00:46:31.173 --> 00:46:33.140
LAURA: Vulv.
SAM: Vulv, vulv, vulv.

1185
00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:33.973
LAURA: Eight.

1186
00:46:33.973 --> 00:46:34.806
MATT: Eight.

1187
00:46:34.806 --> 00:46:36.672
Nothing.

1188
00:46:36.672 --> 00:46:38.450
ASHLEY: How far down--
SAM: 20 feet.

1189
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:39.630
ASHLEY: It was 20 feet.

1190
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.740
MATT: 15, 20 feet to the bottom part of the floor.

1191
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.490
The staircases bring you down to it.

1192
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.160
LIAM: Ready to light this room up?

1193
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.680
ASHLEY: We can't see anyone else in there, just the stone.

1194
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.230
MATT: Not in this light, no.

1195
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:53.740
You rolled a natural 20 on your perception check

1196
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.530
and you don't see anybody else in the room.

1197
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:56.450
TRAVIS: They'd know if we're coming.

1198
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:58.320
We haven't been quiet. There was no door.

1199
00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.153
Light it up.

1200
00:46:59.153 --> 00:47:01.250
SAM: I'm going to take a swig and go invisible.

1201
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:02.083
MATT: Okay.

1202
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.550
Nott vanishes.

1203
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:07.516
LIAM: I pull out the driftglobe and light it up

1204
00:47:07.516 --> 00:47:10.758
and say Tawhaj

1205
00:47:10.758 --> 00:47:12.200
and it floats next to us.

1206
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.810
LAURA and MARISHA: Tawhaj.

1207
00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:15.420
MATT: It lights up and--
LIAM: It's on the paper.

1208
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.310
MATT: Yep.

1209
00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.540
It creates the Daylight spell, which lights the chamber.

1210
00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.623
You can now see plainly this stone

1211
00:47:25.289 --> 00:47:29.750
tomb, sarcophagus-like structure, fairly simple.

1212
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.940
Has three sets of dark chains pulled across it.

1213
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.390
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh.
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1214
00:47:36.541 --> 00:47:37.813
SAM: It's a bike repair shop.

1215
00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:39.955
MATT: Looking up, you can see--
LAURA: Blood all over the ceiling.

1216
00:47:39.955 --> 00:47:44.700
MATT: No, there is a massive mural painted across it.

1217
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.720
What you see is a violent depiction of a swollen,

1218
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:53.500
pale, worm-like body, coiled to a grotesque length,

1219
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.370
burrowing through landscapes of vibrant trees,

1220
00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:00.740
turbulent oceans, fiery mountains, and desolate barrens.

1221
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.150
At the center of this worm-like form

1222
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:07.900
extends three elongated arms ending in grasping hands,

1223
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.630
wreathing a bulbous, hairless, humanoid head,

1224
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.640
screaming, bearing a crooked crown.

1225
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:19.080
The eyes are black voids, the mouth open,

1226
00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.100
the grimace revealing rows of serrated teeth.

1227
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:27.100
It's detailed, but also jagged in the art.

1228
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.842
There is talent in this,

1229
00:48:29.842 --> 00:48:34.510
but it isn't refined.

1230
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:37.072
LIAM: Ladies and gentlemen, the Crawling King.

1231
00:48:37.072 --> 00:48:38.239
MARISHA: Yeah.

1232
00:48:39.884 --> 00:48:42.790
TRAVIS: Does it look like it's carved into the ceiling?

1233
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.870
MATT: Best you can tell, it looks like it's painted.

1234
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.370
TRAVIS: Okay.

1235
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:48.897
Jagged.

1236
00:48:48.897 --> 00:48:50.240
MATT: It's beautiful and there's a lot of colors.

1237
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.540
You can see the detail,

1238
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.590
but the lines aren't smooth.

1239
00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:55.560
The lines are a little rough to give it

1240
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.850
this weird, violent feel to a still image.

1241
00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.225
TRAVIS: On the opposite wall from us,

1242
00:49:01.225 --> 00:49:02.308
where we are at this railing,

1243
00:49:02.308 --> 00:49:04.950
is it a matching sort of walkway around

1244
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.590
or just the stairs that go down to the--

1245
00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:07.660
MATT: The stairs that go down.

1246
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.493
There's no other walkway.

1247
00:49:08.493 --> 00:49:09.480
It's just an open room.

1248
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.610
You see the walls go straight

1249
00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.360
and then just angle inward

1250
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.110
and then you see two torches on the opposite end

1251
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.350
that are just faintly burning.

1252
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.016
TRAVIS: Doorways? Any sort of--

1253
00:49:17.016 --> 00:49:19.150
MATT: From what you can see, no other doorways.

1254
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:20.640
But you're quite a distance to check.

1255
00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.700
LIAM: How are these chains affixed in here again?

1256
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:27.510
MATT: There's three sets of them that cross over

1257
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:28.343
from corner to corner.

1258
00:49:28.343 --> 00:49:29.270
LIAM: Over the slab.

1259
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:31.000
MATT: Over the slab and then a center one there, yeah.

1260
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.410
LIAM: Where do they come from?

1261
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:33.530
Are they coming out of the ground?

1262
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:34.400
MATT: They're coming off the ground.

1263
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.190
They're like locked in there and bolted.

1264
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.320
LIAM: Bolted to the--
TRAVIS: Well, might as well go

1265
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.500
down and see what all the fuss is about.

1266
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.333
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1267
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:43.700
TRAVIS: I'll start walking down the right side.

1268
00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.390
SAM: I'll go left.
MATT: Okay.

1269
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:47.180
While invisible.

1270
00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.740
What's up, Jester?

1271
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.490
LAURA: Sorry, does it look like, this is stupid,

1272
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.860
that the mural on the, that it's a still image,

1273
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.310
it's not moving at all?

1274
00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.160
MATT: Make a perception check.

1275
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.210
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

1276
00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.480
LAURA: Ooh.

1277
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.600
A 24.

1278
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.040
MATT: You glance up and focus, holding your breath

1279
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.430
for a second and just waiting

1280
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.130
for any sort of shift or movement.

1281
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.950
It's still.

1282
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:16.970
It's an art relief.

1283
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:18.610
TRAVIS: Fuck you, Matt, goddamn it.

1284
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:19.443
MATT: What?

1285
00:50:19.443 --> 00:50:22.430
SAM: Any ivory around?

1286
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.380
MATT: Ivory?

1287
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.390
Around like the room?

1288
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:30.060
SAM: I don't know, yeah, sure.

1289
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.710
MATT: Make a perception check.

1290
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:34.060
TRAVIS: What?

1291
00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:34.893
SAM: Ten.

1292
00:50:34.893 --> 00:50:37.930
MATT: Ten, you don't see any ivory.

1293
00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:40.450
LIAM: I'm going to grab the driftglobe out of the air

1294
00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:44.050
and tentatively follow Fjord down the stairs he's going.

1295
00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:46.040
I am nervous to get close to this thing,

1296
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.810
but is there any writing of any kind on the slab,

1297
00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.010
on the walls down here?

1298
00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.250
MATT: Okay, as you head down to the right.

1299
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.490
As you're curving down the stairway,

1300
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:57.670
there's a slight corner, like a gap,

1301
00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.180
where the stairs drop off, and it's just a little

1302
00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.860
alcove that's cut off from the rest of the chamber.

1303
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.210
You can see there's a singular torch

1304
00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:04.190
there that's flickering.

1305
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:05.023
TRAVIS: To the right?

1306
00:51:05.023 --> 00:51:06.480
MATT: To the right as you're heading down.

1307
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.270
And on the wall up, you can see the same writing

1308
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:14.130
that you saw on the obelisk when you first entered this

1309
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.600
from the tunnel.

1310
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.210
LAURA: Is that build every bridge,

1311
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.126
become every nightmare, feast on every heart.

1312
00:51:20.126 --> 00:51:21.740
MATT: Yeah.

1313
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.523
MARISHA: Is there writing on top of the

1314
00:51:23.523 --> 00:51:24.981
slab with the chains,

1315
00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:27.600
on top of the sarcophagus?

1316
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.750
MATT: Hard to see at this distance.

1317
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.560
Are you joining the rest of the folks down there to look?

1318
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.226
TRAVIS: Wait wait wait.
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll move down.

1319
00:51:32.226 --> 00:51:33.059
I'm just following.

1320
00:51:33.059 --> 00:51:34.290
TRAVIS: I want to make sure these stairs don't turn

1321
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:36.180
into fucking slides and then we're stuck down here

1322
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.750
or some shit.

1323
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:39.010
Are they stone stairs?

1324
00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:40.090
Do they like there's a hinge

1325
00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:41.320
or any sort of movement to them?

1326
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.180
They look steady?

1327
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.970
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1328
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:44.803
SAM: I'm just going to walk down.

1329
00:51:44.803 --> 00:51:46.628
TRAVIS: Goddamn Hurricane Harbor in this bitch.

1330
00:51:46.628 --> 00:51:48.180
What the fuck?

1331
00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.150
Eight.
MATT: Eight, okay.

1332
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.250
It looks pretty solid to you.

1333
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.940
Nott, you head down.

1334
00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.870
As you and Fjord make your curve down the stairway--

1335
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:59.360
MARISHA: I'll wait to the top.
LAURA: Yeah, same.

1336
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.850
MATT: You reach the bottom without issues and your stairs.

1337
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:03.120
TRAVIS: You can't keep doing that.

1338
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.510
I have a heart break.

1339
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.130
MARISHA: I turn around the way we came.

1340
00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:07.020
MATT: Okay.

1341
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.360
MARISHA: Is there anything behind us and does it look like

1342
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:15.100
when we entered this chamber if there's like a door

1343
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.240
at the end of this or something that could cut us off?

1344
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.810
MATT: Make a perception check.

1345
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.480
LIAM: Oof, bing-bong.

1346
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.840
TRAVIS: What is fucking happening?

1347
00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.950
LIAM: Our dice are haunted tonight.
MARISHA: Six.

1348
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:27.420
MATT: You don't see anything in the hallway

1349
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.420
behind you following up.

1350
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.710
And from what you can see, it looks like a continuation

1351
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:32.550
of the stone bricks.

1352
00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:35.570
You don't see anything that could be a door or a wall.

1353
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:38.790
MARISHA: He's the god of imprisonment and torture.

1354
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.590
LIAM: Yeah.

1355
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.730
Yeah, it's been a running theme for the campaign.

1356
00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:44.080
I'm checking out this alcove.

1357
00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.440
Does anything that you said, there's a torch in there

1358
00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.910
or a candelabra there, right?

1359
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:49.520
MATT: There's a torch onto the wall that's just

1360
00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.970
been burning.

1361
00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.740
You assume for it to be burning,

1362
00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.740
if it's been here as long as this has been built,

1363
00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.530
this is a torch that does not stop burning.

1364
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.860
LIAM: Right, and is there any relief or stone

1365
00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.770
that could be pressed or anything mechanical in here?

1366
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:04.603
MATT: Whereabouts?

1367
00:53:04.603 --> 00:53:05.650
LIAM: In this alcove.

1368
00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:08.880
In the alcove specifically around this.

1369
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.290
MATT: Do you want to like carefully

1370
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:11.730
and go through and check it out?

1371
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.897
Investigation check.

1372
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:19.730
LIAM: Can't roll for shit, 16.

1373
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:20.877
MATT: 16.

1374
00:53:20.877 --> 00:53:22.009
That's not bad.

1375
00:53:22.009 --> 00:53:23.928
(chuckles)

1376
00:53:23.928 --> 00:53:25.790
LIAM: It's a six.
MATT: Fair enough.

1377
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:29.080
You don't see anything in there that resembles a switch

1378
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.310
or a pressure plate.

1379
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:34.730
It just looks like an alcove.

1380
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.350
TRAVIS: At the bottom, can I move towards the far end

1381
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.330
of opposite where we were at the railing

1382
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.084
just to see what's over there by those two sconces and shit?

1383
00:53:42.084 --> 00:53:43.692
LAURA: You're going to walk past the sarcophagus?

1384
00:53:43.692 --> 00:53:44.970
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, other people are looking at it.

1385
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:46.530
You don't need all of us.

1386
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:48.680
MATT: Okay. You move across the opposite side,

1387
00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:49.580
head over to the two torches.

1388
00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.110
Similar to the ones that are in the two alcoves,

1389
00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:54.070
they're affixed to the wall.

1390
00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:57.630
You can see the wall just continues up and meets the mural

1391
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.200
where there's the large arched ceiling there

1392
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.250
in the center.

1393
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.110
Nothing else in particular.

1394
00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:04.510
TRAVIS: No like pressure plates or pulley thingies or...

1395
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:05.510
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1396
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:08.110
TRAVIS: God, son of a crap fire.

1397
00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:11.524
You know what, where's that Grog die, there you go.

1398
00:54:11.524 --> 00:54:13.230
(sighs)

1399
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.063
14.

1400
00:54:14.063 --> 00:54:15.070
MATT: 14.

1401
00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:17.150
You take a moment to start like feeling around

1402
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:21.610
and checking any of the stone sections that are,

1403
00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:23.350
you know, the edges and corners to look

1404
00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:26.210
for unnatural gaps and like pulling the sconces.

1405
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:27.100
You go and pull one of the sconces.

1406
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.470
The torch comes out and put it back in.

1407
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:32.410
Nothing seems to be a mechanism of any kind.

1408
00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:35.060
MARISHA: I move down.
TRAVIS: Nothing over here.

1409
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.500
LIAM: Same.

1410
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.484
MATT: So Yasha, you went down the...

1411
00:54:39.484 --> 00:54:41.150
ASHLEY: I went down the left side.
MATT: The left side with Nott.

1412
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:43.230
Jester, Caduceus, you guys?

1413
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.270
TALIESIN: I followed Yasha.

1414
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.161
LAURA: I go the opposite way.

1415
00:54:46.161 --> 00:54:48.170
MATT: Okay, so you guys have all down in the central area.

1416
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:51.390
There's the four candelabras sitting at the corners

1417
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:53.480
of this raised step platform

1418
00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.080
where the sarcophagus sits atop.

1419
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.043
MARISHA: Okay.

1420
00:54:57.043 --> 00:54:58.844
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1421
00:54:58.844 --> 00:54:59.677
Okay.

1422
00:54:59.677 --> 00:55:01.330
SAM: I'm going to scoot around towards the sort

1423
00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:02.550
of the opposite corner of the room,

1424
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.080
the back corner of the room, behind the sarcophagus.

1425
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.913
MATT: Okay.

1426
00:55:05.913 --> 00:55:07.650
So you move similar to where Fjord is

1427
00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:10.830
but a little more to the edge where the wall itself

1428
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.570
is like a cropped corner.

1429
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.390
SAM: And then how far from the sarcophagus

1430
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:16.440
if I want to walk up and inspect it?

1431
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.190
MATT: About 15, 20 feet.

1432
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.240
SAM: I will stealth over there and look at the sarcoph.

1433
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.073
MATT: Yeah.

1434
00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.950
Go ahead and make an investigation

1435
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:28.950
or perception check for me, your choice.

1436
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:32.580
SAM: Drunk, 15.

1437
00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:34.560
MATT: 15, okay.

1438
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.210
On the side closest to you, that's on...

1439
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.530
If you're looking from where you entered on the left side

1440
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:43.170
of the sarcophagus-type structure,

1441
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:46.820
you see a faint golden sigil that overlaps

1442
00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:51.410
where a thin line marks where the lid of this would be.

1443
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:53.970
SAM: Do I recognize the sigil?

1444
00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:54.910
MATT: Make an arcana check.

1445
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:57.580
SAM: I'm terrible at that.

1446
00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.670
Natural one.

1447
00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:00.540
MATT: You have no idea.

1448
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:01.556
LAURA: I wonder if it's Celestial.

1449
00:56:01.556 --> 00:56:03.340
MATT: It looks like a B.

1450
00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.802
SAM: Cool.
TRAVIS: Hello, B.

1451
00:56:04.802 --> 00:56:06.456
(laughter)

1452
00:56:06.456 --> 00:56:08.120
LIAM: I head over to the sarcophagus as well

1453
00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.660
and super on-edge going to start to make a circle

1454
00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.750
around the whole thing to see if there's anything to read.

1455
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:15.430
LAURA: I'm going to stay up against the wall

1456
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:16.720
where the railing was.

1457
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.553
ASHLEY: I'm going to make sure I'm--

1458
00:56:17.553 --> 00:56:19.820
MATT: Oh, so you took off to the, which wall?

1459
00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:20.690
SAM: You didn't come downstairs?

1460
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:21.840
LAURA: Like I came down the stairs

1461
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.780
and then I just stayed over by the stairs.

1462
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.910
Is it like a drop-off where the railing was above us, then?

1463
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:28.450
MATT: Yeah, so you can go head over by that wall

1464
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.750
and looking up at it, okay.

1465
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:31.474
And what are you doing?

1466
00:56:31.474 --> 00:56:33.830
ASHLEY: I want to be near Caleb by the sarcophagus.

1467
00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:36.240
TRAVIS: While he's doing that, since we're all down here,

1468
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.100
I will walk back up to the top of the railing

1469
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.760
and keep an eye on the hallway.

1470
00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.680
MATT: Okay.

1471
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.440
LIAM: As I do that I pull out my pearl and hold it

1472
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.720
to my forehead and cast Fortune's Favor on myself.

1473
00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.930
MATT: You got it.

1474
00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:49.763
Okay.

1475
00:56:49.763 --> 00:56:53.410
You go around the opposite side that Nott invisibly is at.

1476
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.150
You don't see her necessarily.

1477
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.420
On the other side, which would be the right side

1478
00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.270
of the sarcophagus where you're looking at it

1479
00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:00.620
head-on from where you entered,

1480
00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:04.150
there is a matching golden sigil there that rests

1481
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:07.640
across where the lid itself, where the line is.

1482
00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.090
LIAM: And it doesn't mean anything to me?

1483
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:10.853
MATT: Make an arcana check.
TRAVIS: Come on.

1484
00:57:10.853 --> 00:57:13.143
Come on you fucking wizard.

1485
00:57:13.143 --> 00:57:14.530
SAM: Come on, fucking Liam.

1486
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:15.530
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1487
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:16.870
SAM: Two ones.

1488
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.430
LIAM: Oh, so Fortune's Favor.

1489
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:19.570
MATT: You going to use it now?
LIAM: Yes.

1490
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:21.320
MATT: Go for it.
LAURA: Do it, do it, do it.

1491
00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.710
You going to use the same die?

1492
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:24.940
LIAM: I'm doing investigation?

1493
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.773
MATT: This is arcana.

1494
00:57:25.773 --> 00:57:27.690
LIAM: Arcana.

1495
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:28.980
Same, 21.

1496
00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.940
MATT: 21, okay.

1497
00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.418
This is a strong abjuration.

1498
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.377
It is protective.

1499
00:57:37.377 --> 00:57:38.820
MARISHA: Containment.
MATT: Containment.

1500
00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:42.140
It is an element of what is probably

1501
00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.240
holding this thing together.

1502
00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.490
LAURA: And it's held together?

1503
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.300
It doesn't look like it's been moved at all?

1504
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.133
It's still there?

1505
00:57:48.133 --> 00:57:50.540
SAM: Are there any grooves, pits, holes,

1506
00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:53.893
or anything on the top of this sarcophagus?

1507
00:57:53.893 --> 00:57:55.950
MATT: No, it's actually pretty smooth and featureless.

1508
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:58.120
Like of as much as there's like intricate carvings

1509
00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.350
in other places here you've seen, especially the statues

1510
00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:03.160
and you know, elements of previous chambers

1511
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.700
that you've gone through, this seems pretty simple.

1512
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.160
LAURA: Is there any rivulets or any like trenches

1513
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.500
on the ground, anything in the ceiling

1514
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.870
that looks like it could drip blood around the sarcophagus?

1515
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.770
MATT: Make a perception check.

1516
00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:15.040
TALIESIN: I also want to check out the wall

1517
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.760
behind as we came down the stairs.

1518
00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.680
I want to see that, that, you know.

1519
00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:22.080
MATT: Yeah, you can pass by Fjord

1520
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.130
to trace his steps across the back wall.

1521
00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:25.167
SAM: One!

1522
00:58:25.167 --> 00:58:27.000
LIAM: Oh!

1523
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:27.833
MATT: What is that?

1524
00:58:27.833 --> 00:58:29.510
Natural one.
LAURA: One.

1525
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:30.468
MATT: Okay.

1526
00:58:30.468 --> 00:58:31.301
(laughs)

1527
00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:32.930
SAM: This is crazy.

1528
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:37.520
MATT: So Fjord, you're walking back,

1529
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.830
heading towards the base of the stairs

1530
00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:42.523
and you see a figure step up to the railing.

1531
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:45.408
TRAVIS: Eyes up.

1532
00:58:45.408 --> 00:58:48.270
MATT: You all stop and look and glance

1533
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:49.750
and you can see standing there,

1534
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:53.870
cloak over the shoulder, a drow figure.

1535
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:56.540
He goes, "Ha.

1536
00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.270
"Well done.

1537
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:59.150
"Well done indeed.

1538
00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:02.880
"I am impressed by your tenacity and your capabilities.

1539
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:06.178
"It is with great wisdom that I fled when we first met.

1540
00:59:06.178 --> 00:59:08.895
"(chuckles)

1541
00:59:08.895 --> 00:59:10.920
"Do you know where you stand?"

1542
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.180
TRAVIS: Bet you're going to fucking tell us.

1543
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.010
LAURA: Please tell us.

1544
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.620
I shout from below.

1545
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.170
MATT: He looks over the railing at you with a smile.

1546
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:22.842
"Welcome to the heart of the King's Cage,

1547
00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:27.730
"a relic of the Calamity, devised as a temple

1548
00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:32.500
"built to Torog around a primal fane of corrupting power.

1549
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:36.290
"It was built secretly by the Allhammer, Moradin,

1550
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:41.290
"and Sehanine, the Moonweaver, to lure Torog into its use.

1551
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.710
"Once bound to the fane,

1552
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:46.350
"it was instrumental in banishing him

1553
00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:49.630
"beyond the planes to his fate within the boundaries

1554
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:51.890
"of the Far Realm.

1555
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:56.140
"However, this left the temple still corrupted

1556
00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:59.973
"and Post-Divergence, it fell entirely into the control

1557
00:59:59.973 --> 01:00:04.923
"of Torog zealots and his Undying Chosen,

1558
01:00:04.923 --> 01:00:09.700
"who, like his master, could not really be slain.

1559
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:14.700
"The martyrs for Sehanine fought them to these depths

1560
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:19.320
"and sealed it with their own celestial life forces

1561
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.353
"so they could all be forgotten.

1562
01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:29.300
"Now, I'm curious, why do you seek me out?

1563
01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.720
"We've not met before

1564
01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.720
"and yet you so abruptly interrupt a meeting?

1565
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:39.910
"I'm curious, what stake have you in this game?

1566
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:40.880
"What do you know of me?

1567
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.607
"Why have you followed me?"

1568
01:00:45.537 --> 01:00:47.153
LAURA: Uh.

1569
01:00:48.653 --> 01:00:51.515
SAM: It was several sessions ago, I don't know.

1570
01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:53.100
TRAVIS: He's the source of upheaval.

1571
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.020
MARISHA: You...

1572
01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.686
sort of called out one of our friends over here.

1573
01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:04.180
So that gave immediate alarm.

1574
01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.980
Had you not done that, maybe we wouldn't have.

1575
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.550
So since you love monologuing,

1576
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.900
why don't you tell us what you want with her?

1577
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.290
MATT: "You still haven't answered my question.

1578
01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:18.130
"You were there, you attacked me and my compatriot.

1579
01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:23.038
"You attempted to interrupt what was a

1580
01:01:24.154 --> 01:01:26.480
"secretive exchange.

1581
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.120
"How did you come about this information and why?"

1582
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.640
TRAVIS: We are very talented individuals.

1583
01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.660
There is a sensitive balance being struck

1584
01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.240
between the Dynasty and the Empire.

1585
01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.450
And from what we saw, you are trying to upset that.

1586
01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.660
We don't want to see any further loss of life,

1587
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:45.950
and therefore we tried to thwart whatever plans you have.

1588
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:47.530
Now, are you going to tell us what you know

1589
01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:49.650
about our friend or are you just going to stand

1590
01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.950
up there and die?

1591
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:54.190
MATT: "You seem an odd assortment of vagabond mercenaries

1592
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:57.670
"to be wandering these planes of Xhorhas.

1593
01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.520
"Where does your allegiance lie?"

1594
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.740
MARISHA: You keep asking questions,

1595
01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.830
man, without answering ours first.

1596
01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:06.190
TRAVIS: Yeah, tit-for-tat, right?

1597
01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:10.595
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1598
01:02:10.595 --> 01:02:11.860
SAM: Oh boy.

1599
01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.417
LIAM: I suggest you come clean and I cast Suggest.

1600
01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:18.480
MATT: You cast Suggestion?

1601
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.350
MARISHA: 20 total.

1602
01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:22.344
MATT: Okay.

1603
01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.610
Is that a wisdom save?

1604
01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:25.443
LIAM: 17, yeah.

1605
01:02:25.443 --> 01:02:30.360
MATT: 17, you got it.

1606
01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:39.540
No joke, double natural 20s.

1607
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.700
SAM: Whoa.

1608
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.542
TRAVIS: Yep, confirmed.

1609
01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:44.650
Shit. Wow.

1610
01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:47.200
LAURA: Why did you get two 20s and we're all getting ones?

1611
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.914
TRAVIS: Guys, guys.

1612
01:02:48.914 --> 01:02:52.391
LAURA: The dice don't like us tonight.

1613
01:02:52.391 --> 01:02:55.130
MATT: But in answering your question he goes,

1614
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:58.690
"Well, I had thought you lost, Orphan Maker.

1615
01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:02.260
For so long, you were the prize of us.

1616
01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:06.320
For months, we sought the threads of the Angel's designs.

1617
01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.190
You and I were the heart and the vessel.

1618
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:12.230
Working towards her broken requests.

1619
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:16.032
You watch as his form beings to slightly shift.

1620
01:03:16.032 --> 01:03:20.182
The drow dropping away leaving behind

1621
01:03:20.182 --> 01:03:23.160
red skin, yellow eyes.

1622
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.020
SAM: What?

1623
01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.963
MATT: Horns that curl up across the head,

1624
01:03:26.963 --> 01:03:28.430
and a pair of red leathery wings

1625
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:29.561
that lie folded across the back.

1626
01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:30.820
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

1627
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.310
MATT: A figure you've seen in your dreams

1628
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:35.703
and visions a number of times as of late.

1629
01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.210
"Swaths of innocents who questioned our holy journey

"Then, you vanished.

ASHLEY: What does that mean?

1650
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.420
MATT: "Well, it seems the time is nigh.

MARISHA: No.

1656
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.703
No.

1657
01:05:16.703 --> 01:05:20.620
MATT: Just taking a central position above you.

1658
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.890
About 20 feet.

1659
01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:25.500
Reaches and pulls out a stone slab.

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.430
MARISHA: Yes.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

Oh boy oh boy oh boy.

Oh, oh boy.

LIAM: Plus a d8, yeah.

LAURA: Ooh.
SAM: Gigantic thing.

1668
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.920
I think we're going into combat, guys, and if we are,

1669
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.570
you guys should know that this combat

1670
01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:51.778
is powered by Dwarven Forge.

1671
01:05:51.778 --> 01:05:53.990
Their Hellscape Kickstarter campaign's going on now.

1672
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:56.950
It's full of illuminated magma rivers,

1673
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:58.710
hand-sculpted devilish details

1674
01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:00.760
and all the infernal accessories you need

1675
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.560
to build your own personal hell.

1676
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.210
Mine is inside this helmet.

TALIESIN: Oh lord, no.

1680
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:14.305
This is bad.

ASHLEY: Don't let him out.

SAM: Oh boy.

1684
01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.600
It's like the ballroom of the Titanic.

1685
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.480
MATT: So Jester, you were down there.

1686
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.880
LAURA: Yeah, right there.

1687
01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.088
MATT: Fjord, you were attempting to come back up

1688
01:06:30.088 --> 01:06:31.370
the steps here.

1689
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:32.203
TRAVIS: Yep.

1690
01:06:32.203 --> 01:06:33.560
LIAM: Nott and Caleb were on the sarcophagus.

1691
01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.820
MATT: Correct.
SAM: On either side.

1692

MARISHA: I was mirrored Fjord.

1694

TALIESIN: I was near Beau.

1695
01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:43.922
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was next to Caleb.

1696
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.603
Yeah.
MATT: Correct.

1697
01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:50.210
All righty.

1698
01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:51.171
SAM: Oh boysy.

1699
01:06:51.171 --> 01:06:53.764
TRAVIS: (nervous shrieking)

1700
01:06:53.764 --> 01:06:54.920
SAM: Wait, Fjord--
LAURA: Wait, I thought he was--

1701
01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.450
SAM: I thought you were up top, Fjord.

1702
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:58.604

MATT: So.

1706
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.630
TRAVIS: (repeatedly) We're good, we're good, we're good.

LAURA: No.

1709
01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.821

That brings us to 25 to 20.

1714
01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:26.140
SAM: 20.
LAURA: 24.

1715
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.485
TALIESIN: Whoa.

LIAM: Also eight.

1722

MATT: All right.

1723
01:07:56.217 --> 01:07:57.867

TALIESIN: Four.

1725

MATT: Top of the round, Jester, you are up first.

1727

SAM: Yes.

1728

MATT: You can hear him beginning to read off of the tablet,

1729
01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.570
this heavy Abyssal phrase beginning to spill

1730
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:15.730
out of his mouth, resonant and echoing

1731
01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:16.570
through the center of the chamber.

1732
01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:18.203
What are you doing?

1733
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.200

1734
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.530
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1735
01:08:25.530 --> 01:08:26.720
I've got two things, I know, I know.

1736
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.270
I just happened to be at the top of the initiative, okay?

1737
01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.200
So just one second.

1738
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.489
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1739
01:08:34.489 --> 01:08:36.260
Okay.

1740
01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.380
Okay.

1741
01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.210
I'm going to, I'm just going to bust it out.

1742
01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:40.100
I'm just going to do it.

1743
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:44.110
I'm just going to cast Dominate Person.

1744
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:46.952
MATT: Going to cast Dominate Person?
SAM: Yeah.

1745
01:08:46.952 --> 01:08:49.020
MATT: All righty.

1746
01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.660
SAM: He's looking at the spell language.

1747
01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.840
LAURA: It's a humanoid.

1748
01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.673
SAM: Humanoid, yes.

1749
01:08:53.673 --> 01:08:56.220
LAURA: I can see within range, within 60 feet.

1750
01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.780
So I'll move forward if I need to.

1751
01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.080
MATT: All right.

1752
01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:02.860
You move a little bit forward just to feel safe about it.

1753
01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:07.853
All right, you go ahead and cast Dominate Person.

1754
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.880
SAM: Oh boy.

1755
01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.220
MATT: All right, you unleash the spell.

1756
01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:19.630
And unfortunately, the brain is not humanoid.

1757
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:20.742
The essence of this creature

1758
01:09:20.742 --> 01:09:24.660
is different, possibly fiendish.

1759
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.493
Sorry.

1760
01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:27.290
LAURA: Oh, I thought humanoid meant like it had--

1761
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:28.123
SAM: In the shape of a human.

1762
01:09:28.123 --> 01:09:30.230
LAURA: It had the shape of the human.

1763
01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:32.880
That's not what that means?
MATT: No.

1764
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.920
LAURA: Good to know.

1765
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.260
Okay, that's fine.

1766
01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.300
That's fine.

1767
01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:40.397
I'm going to run forward.

1768
01:09:40.397 --> 01:09:41.500
MATT: All right.

1769
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.160
Whereabouts?
LAURA: And get like...

1770
01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.520
MATT: Towards the sarcophagus, around it?

1771
01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.950
LAURA: Towards the sarcophagus within,

1772
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:51.330
if I have to jump up on it, I will.

1773
01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:53.900
But I want to get 20 feet from that guy

1774
01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:57.510
and I'm going to, as a bonus action, use my whip.

1775
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:58.510
MATT: It's an action to use it.

1776
01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:00.428
LAURA: It's a bonus action.

1777
01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.380
It's not, you can use it to grapple the target,

1778
01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.540
but it's an action to use it.

1779
01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.440
MATT: It is, yeah.

1780
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.585
LAURA: I understand, great.

1781
01:10:10.585 --> 01:10:11.617
I'm doing real good.

1782
01:10:11.617 --> 01:10:13.417
MATT: It's okay. You still want to be on top of the

1783
01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:14.430
sarcophagus?

1784
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:15.263
LAURA: Fuck it, yeah.

1785
01:10:15.263 --> 01:10:16.990
MATT: All right, you got it, Jester. Nott, you're up.

1786
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:18.170
SAM: I'm up?
MATT: Yes.

1787
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.003
LAURA: That was great.

1788
01:10:19.003 --> 01:10:20.140
It was a good turn, you guys.

1789
01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.270
Good moves.

1790
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:23.762
SAM: I don't want him to talk.

1791
01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:25.790
I don't want him to talk because he's going to

1792
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:27.259
unleash whatever the thing is, so we got to stop that.

1793
01:10:27.259 --> 01:10:29.400
MARISHA: Make him drop that tablet.

1794
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.390
SAM: So I got to, he's going to defeat this,

1795
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:33.890
but I will break my invisibility

1796
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:38.890
and cast a spell at him, Tasha's Hideous Laughter.

1797
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.670
MATT: Tasha's Hideous Laughter, all righty.

1798
01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.260
SAM: I'm going to take a little piece of tart out

1799
01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:45.410
and a feather and I sprinkle them to the ground

1800
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:48.990
and I say to him: Hey, what does a devil

1801
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:51.667
and a tree have in common?

1802
01:10:51.667 --> 01:10:54.237
Intelligence?

1803
01:10:54.237 --> 01:10:56.050
That's it, that's my joke.

1804
01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:57.290
MATT: What's the DC?

1805
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:59.160
SAM: 15.

1806
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.730
MATT: Yeah, it has no effect.

1807
01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:02.203
The joke does not land.
SAM: Damn.

1808
01:11:02.203 --> 01:11:04.300
MATT: It just continues to read unfazed.

1809
01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.710
SAM: You said tree?
MATT: No.

1810
01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:08.810
SAM: Oh, read.
MATT: Just completely enraptured

1811
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:10.980
by the words that he's speaking.

1812
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:15.350
Eyes wide, smile on the face, unfazed by your spell.

1813
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:18.060
MARISHA: I don't want to fight a worm.

1814
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.990
I don't want to fight a worm with a crown.

1815
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:22.060
LAURA: I don't think we're going to fight the worm.

1816
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.622
We're going to fight whatever the worm's servant was.

1817
01:11:24.622 --> 01:11:25.574
MATT: Is that your turn?

1818
01:11:25.574 --> 01:11:27.107
SAM: I will move away from the sarcophagus

1819
01:11:27.107 --> 01:11:28.120
as far as possible

1820
01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.800
and try to hide, bonus action hide.

1821
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.240
MATT: There is technically nowhere to hide.

1822
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.120
You're out in the open.

1823
01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.500
SAM: Well, then I'll just crouch.

1824
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.700
MATT: You could move this way if you want to try

1825
01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.220
and get behind the alcove, but that's up to you.

1826
01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.370
ASHLEY: You're not invisible anymore?

1827
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:43.428
SAM: No, because I cast a spell.

1828
01:11:44.315 --> 01:11:45.930
LAURA: Goddamn it!
SAM: No, I'll stay there.

1829
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.060
LAURA: So mad.
SAM: Stay there.

1830
01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:49.026
MATT: All righty.

1831
01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:55.081
So Obann, the fiendish individual,

1832
01:11:56.081 --> 01:11:57.122
continues to read.

1833
01:11:57.122 --> 01:11:59.780
Does anyone here speak Abyssal or understand it?

1834
01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:00.620
SAM: One of us does.

1835
01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:02.840
Oh yeah, because you're now apparently a devil?

1836
01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.533
TRAVIS: And you used to work with this motherfuck.

1837
01:12:05.533 --> 01:12:09.020
ASHLEY: I need more answers!
I didn't get to ask any questions!

1838
01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.080
Now I'm mad.

1839
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:14.796
MATT: The phrase you hear this round is,

1840
01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:16.510
"By light or by blight,

1841
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:18.780
"the dark eternal shall not be confined,

1842
01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.918
"shall not be contained."

1843
01:12:20.918 --> 01:12:24.290
That is the extent of the phrase you hear this turn.

1844
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:27.750
As he finishes that phrase, both of the golden sigils

1845
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:30.723
on each side of the sarcophagus begin to glow

1846
01:12:30.723 --> 01:12:32.240
and the chains are beginning to rattle.

1847
01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.640
That finishes...

1848
01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.600
Actually for his turn, he's going to fly a little higher

1849
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.717
and get right up into the ceiling and is now

1850
01:12:39.717 --> 01:12:43.550
right against the top.

1851
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:47.230
The wings, you can see now the Daylight spell

1852
01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:48.150
brightening up.

1853
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:50.020
The whole mural is encasing him.

1854
01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:51.240
He looks like he's becoming part of it

1855
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.600
the way the shadows are moving.

1856
01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.520
As the wings flap, you can see the arms reaching around

1857
01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.260
and the screaming head of Torog, the Crawling King,

1858
01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:01.180
just still behind, framing him.

1859
01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.910
So next up we have Fjord.

1860
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:07.180
TRAVIS: Fuck it, let's just get it.

1861
01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.651
I'll go up to the top of the steps.

1862
01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.710
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

1863
01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:14.190
TRAVIS: I'll reach back to those dark thoughts

1864
01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:16.050
from my dreams and see a creature moving

1865
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:17.330
in the background and I'll point

1866
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:21.521
and make my eyes roll back and I'll say: Barlgura.

1867
01:13:21.521 --> 01:13:24.804
And summon a greater demon right above him.

1868
01:13:24.804 --> 01:13:26.840
MATT: Okay.

1869
01:13:27.816 --> 01:13:29.320
Where do you want to throw it down?

1870
01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.120
TRAVIS: Right up in front of him

1871
01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.080
so that he reaches out and goes

1872
01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.000
and just grabs him right in the air.

1873
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:35.833
MATT: Like right there?

1874
01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:40.833
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I will tell him to crush him.

1875
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.640
Just squeeze and grapple him, crush him.

1876
01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.473
MATT: Okay.

1877
01:13:44.473 --> 01:13:47.470
Let me go ahead and bring up the barlgura.

1878
01:13:48.872 --> 01:13:52.100
TALIESIN: I like this Castlevania music we got going on.

1879
01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:55.480
LIAM: So he just bust through reality like the Kool-Aid Man

1880
01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.639
in open air.

1881
01:13:56.639 --> 01:13:58.200
TRAVIS: (growls)

1882
01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.780
LAURA: That's awesome.

1883
01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.680
MATT: Okay.

1884
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.680
So you're doing has its bite and its fist attacks.

1885
01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.260
Are you just attempting to grapple,

1886
01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.170
is that what you're trying to do with it?

1887
01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:10.953
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: All right, so there's no damage.

1888
01:14:10.953 --> 01:14:12.710
TRAVIS: Sure.
MATT: But it makes three attacks.

1889
01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:14.460
So you can attempt it three times.

1890
01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:19.427
Go ahead and make one attack with the barlgura.

1891
01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.700
TRAVIS: I should have looked up his stats.

1892
01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.390
I'll do that in a second.

1893
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:25.220
MATT: I'll say you get...

1894
01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.140
I'll allow two attacks because he is falling

1895
01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.090
from the ceiling.

1896
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.480
I'll say he has time to get two attacks in

1897
01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.100
before he falls out of his range

1898
01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.410
since this creature cannot fly.

1899
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:34.810
TRAVIS: Barlgura.

1900
01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.530
That's a seven.

1901
01:14:37.530 --> 01:14:40.260
MATT: Oh no, it swings wide trying to bite

1902
01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:43.530
and while it's concentrating, darts out of the way,

1903
01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:45.400
in the peripherals, paying attention

1904
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.030
to the assaults around it.

1905
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:49.690
TRAVIS: And a 17.

1906
01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:51.230
MATT: Total 17?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

1907
01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:52.840
MATT: Misses.
TRAVIS: All right.

1908
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.270
Damn it.
MATT: Ducks out of the way.

1909
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:56.590
Barlgura tumbles down to the ground.

1910
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:58.250
Psh.

1911
01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:00.049
Impacts.

1912
01:15:00.049 --> 01:15:03.049
It suffers

1913
01:15:03.049 --> 01:15:05.980
eight points of bludgeoning damage from the fall,

1914
01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.270
cracking the stone on the ground

1915
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.370
and then roars up towards it.

1916
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:11.420
Its third attack going to waste.

1917
01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.560
TRAVIS: Yep.

1918
01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.710
MATT: That finish your turn, Fjord?

1919
01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:16.580
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I will cast Hexblade's Curse

1920
01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.100
on our friend Obann, the single malt scotch.

1921
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.200
MATT: Great, what's the range on Hexblade's Curse?

1922
01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.640
TRAVIS: I think it's 120 feet.

1923
01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.473
Let me double-check.

1924
01:15:23.473 --> 01:15:25.570
SAM: Hexblade's Curse.

1925
01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:27.530
MATT: (chuckles)

1926
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.210
TRAVIS: Nope, never mind, I got to be within 30 feet.

1927
01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:32.040
MATT: Yeah, you got to be a little closer for that, buddy.

1928
01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.840
That's okay, you'll get there soon.

1929
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.730
Okay, so, finishing Fjord's turn.

1930
01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:39.550
Yasha, you're up, Beau and Caleb, you're on deck.

1931
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:41.140
ASHLEY: Okay.

1932
01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.210
I am very, very angry, so I would like to rage.

1933
01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:45.820
MATT: Sure enough.

1934
01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:48.203
ASHLEY: And...

1935
01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:52.000
I would like to get on top of the sarcophagus.

1936
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.200
MATT: You got it.

1937
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.930
You step forward, pushing past Jester.

1938
01:15:57.930 --> 01:15:59.230
Okay.

1939
01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:03.000
ASHLEY: I can't reach him, can I?

1940
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.580
MATT: He's about 20 feet above you right now.

1941
01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.370
Or no, actually, he'd be about 30 feet above you,

1942
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:08.820
because there's 20 feet down and then ten feet up.

1943
01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:12.940
15 feet up, so yeah, he's about 20--

1944
01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.773
ASHLEY: Fuck.

1945
01:16:13.773 --> 01:16:15.810
MATT: About 30 feet above you, yeah.

1946
01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:20.330
ASHLEY: Okay, I yell up at him in Abyssal and I say:

1947
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:23.985
Come down here so I can help you finish.

1948
01:16:23.985 --> 01:16:25.575
LAURA: Ooh!

1949
01:16:25.575 --> 01:16:26.800
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1950
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.790
Or no, this would be a deception check.

1951
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:31.322
ASHLEY: Deception?
MATT: Deception.

1952
01:16:31.322 --> 01:16:32.179
ASHLEY: Damn it.

1953
01:16:32.179 --> 01:16:34.590
MATT: (chuckles)

1954
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.330
LAURA: Yasha's not good at lying?
ASHLEY: Nope.

1955
01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:40.080
I'm terrible at it.

1956
01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:40.956
Two.

1957
01:16:40.956 --> 01:16:42.927
(groaning)

1958
01:16:42.927 --> 01:16:46.785
MATT: The speech that he's shouting outward

1959
01:16:46.785 --> 01:16:47.976
falters for a second

1960
01:16:47.976 --> 01:16:52.557
and the eyes dart towards you and you hear a (tongue clicks)

1961
01:16:52.557 --> 01:16:54.630
and he continues on to the next phrase,

1962
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:57.770
unfazed by your attempts to draw his attention.

1963
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:59.353
ASHLEY: Okay.

1964
01:17:00.599 --> 01:17:01.432
(sighs)

1965
01:17:01.432 --> 01:17:02.907
Shit.

1966
01:17:05.074 --> 01:17:06.630
I can't reach him.

1967
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:07.463
I can't do anything.

1968
01:17:07.463 --> 01:17:09.510
LAURA: Hold your turn until you can reach him.

1969
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:11.220
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll hold my action

1970
01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.280
until he gets within range, if he does.

1971
01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.630
MATT: Okay, you got it.

1972
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.110
Beau and Caleb.

1973
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.943
LIAM: I'm going to beat her to it.

1974
01:17:16.943 --> 01:17:20.880
I'm backing away from the sarcophagus towards where Beau is.

1975
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.100
Fa fa fa fa fa.

1976
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.180
Pulling out the catmint bloom that I have

1977
01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:30.180
and I cast Cat's Ire and a small

1978
01:17:30.905 --> 01:17:32.100
spectral Frumpkin appears

1979
01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:34.440
just above his head up in the air for a split second

1980
01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.850
and giant hand above and I am going to use my action

1981
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:40.040
to shove him down to the ground.

1982
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.840
Strength save.

1983
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.920
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: And I can push him 30 feet.

1984
01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.710
TALIESIN: Ooh.
MATT: All righty.

1985
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:50.370
So appearing here above to attempt to slam him downward,

1986
01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:51.690
it's a strength save, you said?

1987
01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:52.523
LIAM: Strength save, yeah.

1988
01:17:52.523 --> 01:17:54.430
MATT: You got it.

1989
01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:58.491
That is 21.

1990
01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:00.260
LIAM: (groans) Saves.

1991
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.890
LIAM: The hand slams and while still reading

1992
01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:05.320
puts one hand up and shoves it off

1993
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:10.320
and it slams into the ground before recovering slightly.

1994
01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.800
LAURA: What does he have in his hand, like a stone?

1995
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.633
MATT: It's a tablet.
TRAVIS: Somebody scare him

1996
01:18:15.633 --> 01:18:17.746
into coming to the ground. Just dare him.

1997
01:18:17.746 --> 01:18:19.760
I dare you to come down here.

1998
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.720
MATT: That's kind of what...

1999
01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:22.940
So there you go.

2000
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:23.773
All right.

2001
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.110
Beauregard?

2002
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:29.860
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to try some shit.

2003
01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:34.860
I am going to take off running towards the barlgura.

2004
01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:35.760
MATT: Okay.

2005
01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.127
MARISHA: Bulgara, Bulgaria?

2006
01:18:38.127 --> 01:18:39.327
MATT: Barlgura.

2007
01:18:39.327 --> 01:18:41.010
MARISHA: Barlglurl.

2008
01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:43.610
I'm going to head, and as I run,

2009
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:47.200
I'm going to go, koosh, and crash my

2010
01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.650
lightning gloves together.

2011
01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:49.483
MATT: All righty.

2012
01:18:49.483 --> 01:18:51.250
MARISHA: And I want to run.

2013
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:56.250
Can I like parkour jump on top of the bulgara

2014
01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.680
and jump and try and lightning him?

2015
01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.600
MATT: You can certainly try.

2016
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.151
You can certainly try.

2017
01:19:01.151 --> 01:19:02.470
LIAM: Excuse me, point of order, sorry.

2018
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:05.370
I was going, the hand has a Strength of 26.

2019
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:07.183
So he goes down.

2020
01:19:07.183 --> 01:19:08.380
MATT: What's the DC?

2021
01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.227
LIAM: It's the strength, it's a contest.

2022
01:19:12.227 --> 01:19:13.810
MATT: Well, you have to roll a strength check for the hand

2023
01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:14.643
is how it works.

2024
01:19:14.643 --> 01:19:15.755
LIAM: Okay.

2025
01:19:15.755 --> 01:19:17.132
LAURA: And he rolled 21.

2026
01:19:17.132 --> 01:19:19.060
MATT: He rolled a 21.

2027
01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.510
LIAM: Hit points, it drops.

2028
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:21.990
It has a strength of 26, plus eight.

2029
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.261
Sorry, so.

2030
01:19:23.261 --> 01:19:24.094
MATT: Roll.

2031
01:19:24.094 --> 01:19:25.713
LIAM: 19.
MATT: It still would've failed.

2032
01:19:25.713 --> 01:19:26.970
But good call.

2033
01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:29.110
Yeah, strength contest means you actually roll contested.

2034
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:30.300
So good to know for future.

2035
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.420
That was close, that was very close.

2036
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.400
All right, so, Beauregard, go ahead and make

2037
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.118
an acrobatics check to attempt to leap off the barlgura.

2038
01:19:39.118 --> 01:19:41.130
ALL: Bargurlard.

2039
01:19:44.290 --> 01:19:45.470
MARISHA: Ooh.

2040
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:47.350
Acrobatics?
MATT: Yes.

2041
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:48.183
MARISHA: 16.

2042
01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:49.300
MATT: 16, okay.

2043
01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.920
So you run, leap, right as it lands and cracks on the ground

2044
01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.830
and winds up, you see that moment leap,

2045
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:56.950
smash the fists together, they charge with lightning,

2046
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:59.633
you land on its back and you feel it (growls)

2047
01:19:59.633 --> 01:20:02.300
and as it tries to reach up for you instinctually

2048
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.850
you decide to springboard up and you're about ten feet

2049
01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:09.080
below Obann, who's still reading off the tablet.

2050
01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.240
MARISHA: I want to do like a big barrel swing

2051
01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.370
and go bam, bam in the air.

2052
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:14.930
MATT: Go for it.

2053
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:19.170
LIAM: Is this with the lightning?
MARISHA: Yes, both attacks.

2054
01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:23.510
Okay, one is a 28.

2055
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:25.330
MATT: 28 hits.
MARISHA: The other is 17.

2056
01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.540
MATT: Misses.
MARISHA: Okay.

2057
01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:30.470
MATT: One goes wide, one does manage to send one blast

2058
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:31.990
of lightning energy out of your fist,

2059
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:34.320
smashing into his side.

2060
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.650
MARISHA: Okay, nine damage.
MATT: Nine damage.

2061
01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:39.037
SAM: How do you want to do this?

2062
01:20:39.037 --> 01:20:41.280
MATT: (laughs)

2063
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.250
The impact hits and lightning charges through.

2064
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:46.240
You see him take the impact and grit his teeth a bit

2065
01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.850
but he seems...

2066
01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:51.600
MARISHA: Am I able to do a Flurry of Blows or is that extra,

2067
01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.935
is that super too much?

2068
01:20:53.935 --> 01:20:54.768
MATT: I'll--

2069
01:20:54.768 --> 01:20:56.370
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say like as I'm falling I try

2070
01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:57.860
and shoot some kicks.

2071
01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.520
TRAVIS: Boom boom boom boom.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2072
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:03.676
MATT: I'll say roll one more acrobatics check

2073
01:21:03.676 --> 01:21:06.060
and this is a DC of 25 to attempt to do this.

2074
01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.930
You're basically having to land and while the barlgura's

2075
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:11.350
trying to grab at you, you jump off his fist

2076
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:14.210
to try and get a second point of height but...

2077
01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:15.180
MARISHA: Okay.

2078
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.775
Wait, was it?
MATT: 25.

2079
01:21:16.775 --> 01:21:18.780
MARISHA: 22.
MATT: 22.

2080
01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.940
Your foot just slips off of it and you tumble off

2081
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.270
onto the ground, and you don't hurt yourself.

2082
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:24.550
But unfortunately, you're unable to make it

2083
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:25.938
into a Flurry of Blows.

2084
01:21:25.938 --> 01:21:27.587
But you still got one hit off. Boosh.

2085
01:21:27.587 --> 01:21:29.020
That finishes your go, Beauregard.

2086
01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.350
Caduceus, you're up.

2087
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:33.860
TALIESIN: Man, this is just a mess.

2088
01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:34.970
I'm going to...

2089
01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:40.960
Yeah, I got nothing really particularly good right now,

2090
01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.744
so I'm just going to put a...

2091
01:21:43.744 --> 01:21:45.050
TRAVIS: Do you want to put the barlgura at the bottom

2092
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:47.970
of the initiative or somewhere random?

2093
01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:50.580
MATT: Go ahead and roll initiative.

2094
01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:53.117
MARISHA: Can you make him quiet?

2095
01:21:54.147 --> 01:21:59.147
TALIESIN: I'm going to put a Bless on Beau.

2096
01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.977
I'm going to put a Bless on Yasha.

2097
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:05.990
And I'm going to put a Bless on the Balrog.

2098
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:07.840
MATT: The barlgura?
TALIESIN: The barlgura.

2099
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.220
MATT: All right, Bless there and Bless on Yasha, you said?

2100
01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.053
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

2101
01:22:11.053 --> 01:22:13.630
TRAVIS: That's 11 for the barlgura.

2102
01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.110
TALIESIN: So you've got a d4 on your attacks and saves now.

2103
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:17.140
ASHLEY: Oh thank you, Cad.

2104
01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.200
TRAVIS: What is it, a d4 on attacks and saves?

2105
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.680
TALIESIN: d4 on attacks and saves.

2106
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.710
MATT: You guys both got eight

2107
01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:22.240
for your initiative was it earlier?

2108
01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.073
LIAM and MARISHA: Eight.

2109
01:22:23.073 --> 01:22:25.470
TALIESIN: Until I get hit real hard.

2110
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:27.440
ASHLEY: Okay.

2111
01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.370
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up a little bit up the stairs

2112
01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:32.460
and try and get some vantage.

2113
01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:35.420
MATT: One, two, three, four further?

2114
01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:37.080
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's about right, yeah.

2115
01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.440
MATT: Right there, okay.

2116
01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.920
That finishes your go.

2117
01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.220
Top of the round, Jester, it's your turn.

2118
01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.570
SAM: Oh boy, decision time.

2119
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:47.428
Decision time, pressure, sweat.

2120
01:22:50.374 --> 01:22:51.630
Be smart.

2121
01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:53.363
ASHLEY: You got this, bb.

2122
01:22:55.860 --> 01:23:00.018
LAURA: Well, my choices are

2123
01:23:00.018 --> 01:23:01.659
Blindness/Deafness.

2124
01:23:01.659 --> 01:23:02.590
SAM: Seems good.

2125
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:03.998
LAURA: Or I can try to whip him down

2126
01:23:03.998 --> 01:23:05.198
and bring him down with us.

2127
01:23:05.198 --> 01:23:07.340
TRAVIS: I feel like he might have resistance or a save--

2128
01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.498
LAURA: I know, but he's also hard to hit.

2129
01:23:09.498 --> 01:23:11.340
LIAM: That whip just has to hit.

2130
01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.173
LAURA: I know.

2131
01:23:12.173 --> 01:23:13.006
LIAM: He's been rolling with advantage

2132
01:23:13.006 --> 01:23:14.630
for his spell saves, I think.

2133
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:15.970
MATT: It's up to you.
MARISHA: I think grappled doesn't

2134
01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:19.180
mean he would necessarily drop his shit though.

2135
01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:24.050
LIAM: But it's an automatic pull, I think, if she hits.

2136
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:27.300
LAURA: I'm going to try to whip and grab the tablet.

2137
01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:28.600
MARISHA: Yeah.

2138
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.892
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2139
01:23:29.892 --> 01:23:32.183
MATT: That's even harder to hit because it's a specific

2140
01:23:32.183 --> 01:23:34.533
thing in his hand, it's not just him.

2141
01:23:34.533 --> 01:23:36.320
But you can attempt to.

2142
01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.690
LAURA: At least she's close.

2143
01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:39.560
MATT: He's within range.

2144
01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.570
Like just at the cusp of your range.

2145
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:44.030
So you can try and hit him or go for the tablet.

2146
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:46.240
The tablet pulls it out of his hand,

2147
01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.190
but it technically would be considered

2148
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:51.080
three quarters cover because he's--

2149
01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.570
LIAM: Yasha's still holding

2150
01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:53.870
and you're right next to each other--

2151
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:55.960
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I'll just aim for him then.

2152
01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.800
I'll just aim for him.

2153
01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.280
MATT: Okay, make an attack roll.

2154
01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.745
MARISHA: Channel Princess Leia.

2155
01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:03.500
MATT: d20 plus your strength modifier.

2156
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.000
Are you proficient with whips?

2157
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:08.626
LAURA: Simple weapons?

2158
01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:10.060
A whip is a simple weapon.

2159
01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.627
TRAVIS: If she grew up in a harem does that count?

2160
01:24:12.627 --> 01:24:14.050
(laughter)

2161
01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:15.100
MATT: Not a harem.

2162
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.020
LAURA: It wasn't a harem.

2163
01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.590
TRAVIS: I know, I'm sorry, it's my lack of vocabulary.

2164
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:20.860
MATT: The whip is a...

2165
01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.640
The whip is a martial melee weapon.

2166
01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.160
It is not considered a simple weapon.

2167
01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.600
LAURA: That is what you have proficient?

2168
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.940
ASHLEY: It doesn't matter.

2169
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.773
LAURA: Fuck, I can't...

2170
01:24:28.773 --> 01:24:29.606
MATT: Proficiencies.

2171
01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:32.070
Yeah, so you don't get your proficiency bonus.

2172
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:33.780
You do get to add your strength modifier.

2173
01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:37.080
MARISHA: Come on.
LIAM: Come on, stronk girl.

2174
01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.230
MARISHA: Jester's having her Cardi B moment.

2175
01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:41.450
LIAM: Ding dong.

2176
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:43.058
(whip crack)

2177
01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:45.351
ASHLEY: Ding dong.

2178
01:24:45.351 --> 01:24:47.340
MARISHA: (laughs)

2179
01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:48.990
And a new crib for my daughter.

2180
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:50.088
LAURA: I fail.

2181
01:24:50.088 --> 01:24:51.763
MATT: Aw.
SAM: Three.

2182
01:24:51.763 --> 01:24:52.910
MATT: Three, no.

2183
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:53.743
(whip crack)

2184
01:24:53.743 --> 01:24:56.450
It cracks loudly and echoes through the chamber,

2185
01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:58.990
but unfortunately it does not find purchase on your target.

2186
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.823
LAURA: Fine.

2187
01:24:59.823 --> 01:25:00.656
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

2188
01:25:00.656 --> 01:25:01.900
LAURA: Yeah, for my bonus action

2189
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:06.740
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon.

2190
01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.572
MATT: Okay, what level?

2191
01:25:09.572 --> 01:25:12.120
LAURA: Let me see.

2192
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.380
3rd-level, no, 4th-level.

2193
01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.770
4th-level.

2194
01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:17.603
MATT: All righty.

2195
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:21.790
You putting it up with him there?

2196
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:23.630
LAURA: No, I'm going to cast it at 2nd-level.

2197
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:25.700
MATT: Okay.

2198
01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.390
Up by Obann?

2199
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:31.260
LAURA: Yeah, and just try to smack him down.

2200
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.990
MATT: Go for it, make a spell attack roll.

2201
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:34.840
SAM: We've got a lollipop, a cat's paw,

2202
01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.850
and giant baristro or whatever.

2203
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:40.641
LAURA: That definitely hits.
MATT: Baristro.

2204
01:25:40.641 --> 01:25:43.690
Yeah, that definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2205
01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:45.513
LAURA: 11.

2206
01:25:45.513 --> 01:25:47.500
MATT: 11 points of radiant damage.

2207
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.560
Boosh, it slams in the shoulder and you see him

2208
01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.965
duck the wings, falter for a second, (flapping)

2209
01:25:52.965 --> 01:25:54.470
in order to get back up to his space.

2210
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:56.100
Rights his face and just keeps reading.

2211
01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:58.360
But took a hit out of him.

2212
01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.920
That finish your turn?

2213
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.526
Nott, you're up.

2214
01:26:01.526 --> 01:26:03.190
SAM: I'm going to try something that will also fail,

2215
01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:05.020
but we got to stop him from reading this thing.

2216
01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.108
MARISHA: Yes.
TRAVIS: Got to go big.

2217
01:26:06.108 --> 01:26:09.680
SAM: I step forward just a little so I'm within 60 feet.

2218
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:13.440
I will cast Phantasmal Force at him.

2219
01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.170
MATT: Phantasmal Force.
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

2220
01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:18.470
MATT: All righty.
SAM: Intelligence save this time.

2221
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:22.942
Maybe it won't be at advantage, 15.

2222
01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.766
MATT: 20. Sorry.

2223
01:26:25.766 --> 01:26:26.770
SAM: Did you roll with advantage?

2224
01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:28.972
I guess I won't know that.

2225
01:26:31.467 --> 01:26:32.340
Ball sack.

2226
01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:35.770
MATT: So the effect releases and you watch as the effect

2227
01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:38.840
of the arcane sparkle attempts to penetrate

2228
01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.010
the side of his face then it just dissipates off.

2229
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:46.641
Like water dripping off the side of a waterfall.

2230
01:26:46.641 --> 01:26:48.110
SAM: All right, I'll use movement

2231
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:50.070
and bonus to get behind the stairs.

2232
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:51.236
LAURA: Yeah, can I use my movement

2233
01:26:51.236 --> 01:26:52.752
to get off the sarcophagus?

2234
01:26:52.752 --> 01:26:54.830
MATT: Five, six.

2235
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:55.760
You can get there with your movement.

2236
01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.180
SAM: That's fine.
MATT: Okay.

2237
01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.700
You're getting off the sarcophagus?

2238
01:26:58.700 --> 01:26:59.533
Okay.

2239
01:26:59.533 --> 01:27:01.220
How far are you going to move and which direction?

2240
01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.270
LAURA: Back.

2241
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:03.530
MATT: Back this way?
LAURA: Yeah.

2242
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:05.470
MATT: All righty.

2243
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:08.240
15, 20, 25, right there?

2244
01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.640
You got it.

2245
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.900
That finishes your turn.

2246
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:14.639
Obann continues reading in Abyssal.

2247
01:27:14.639 --> 01:27:16.940
(speaking in Abyssal)

2248
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:19.150
You recognize the language.

2249
01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:22.560
The phrase he says is, "The bonds of the clean wither

2250
01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.460
"with flame expended.

2251
01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.800
"Chains to chains to be bound is to break free.

2252
01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.800
"Fulfill thy destined path and awaken."

2253
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.550
The tablet flashes.

2254
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:35.540
The chains, tish, shatter off.

2255
01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:39.844
And the lid, boof, explodes upward.

2256
01:27:39.844 --> 01:27:40.677
You need to go ahead

2257
01:27:40.677 --> 01:27:41.930
and make a dexterity saving throw for me, Yasha.

2258
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:43.130
SAM: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: Add a d4.

2259
01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:44.540
MATT: You get to add a d4 because you're Blessed.

2260
01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.418
TRAVIS: Well.
SAM: Hashtag blessed.

2261
01:27:46.418 --> 01:27:47.670
TRAVIS: Okay.

2262
01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:49.080
LAURA: Hashtag fuck.

2263
01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.110
SAM: Maybe it's friendly.

2264
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:53.690
Ancient buried god of doom.

2265
01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:55.740
LAURA: Sorry, I feel like we failed.

2266
01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:56.690
SAM: We totally failed.

2267
01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:57.930
I should have just fucking shot him.

2268
01:27:57.930 --> 01:27:59.900
MATT: To be fair, he was rolling really well

2269
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.733
on some of those, too.

2270
01:28:00.733 --> 01:28:02.367
TRAVIS: We were throwing everything we had at him.

2271
01:28:02.367 --> 01:28:04.830
MATT: You guys had some solid plans there,

2272
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:06.840
it just the dice, it happens, I'm sorry.

2273
01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.570
LIAM: We do not do well in tombs.
ASHLEY: 23.

2274
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:09.840
LIAM: Historically.

2275
01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.290
LAURA: Historically.
MATT: You manage to just barely

2276
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:15.800
make it out of the way and catch yourself on the ground

2277
01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.850
as the stone lid, woof, flies up and slams into the mural.

2278
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:21.720
Obann barely dodges out of the way.

2279
01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:26.210
Actually, I should roll a saving throw for him, too.

2280
01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:27.260
Failed.

2281
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.470
TALIESIN: Thank god.

2282
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:32.210
MARISHA: A lid hits him, but we fucking couldn't?

2283
01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:34.080
TALIESIN: He gets hit by the cork from the champagne bottle.

2284
01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.720
MATT: Takes eight points of bludgeoning damage.

2285
01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.420
SAM: More people die from that

2286
01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:40.108
than lightning strikes every year.

2287
01:28:40.108 --> 01:28:41.822
MATT: As the lid slams into Obann,

2288
01:28:41.822 --> 01:28:43.780
the tablet stumbles out of his hand.

2289
01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.402
He manages to re-catch himself in the air.

2290
01:28:46.402 --> 01:28:49.730
(wings flapping)

2291
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:51.530
TRAVIS: Oh no, what's inside it?

2292
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:52.363
SAM: What's in the box?

2293
01:28:52.363 --> 01:28:56.080
MATT: There's a brief moment of quiet as you see mist

2294
01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.102
pouring out of the inside.

2295
01:28:59.102 --> 01:29:04.102
A large, meaty, pale hand, boosh, grasps the side.

2296
01:29:05.003 --> 01:29:05.836
And we're going to take a break.

2297
01:29:05.836 --> 01:29:07.910
ALL: (screaming) No!

2298
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:09.369
TRAVIS: You got to be shitting me!

2299
01:29:09.369 --> 01:29:11.670
You can't do that!

2300
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:13.657
MATT: We're about to go into probably a longer

2301
01:29:13.657 --> 01:29:15.270
stretch of battle.

2302
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:16.960
This is a beat where we can--

2303
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.397
LIAM: It's going to be a master debate.

2304
01:29:19.397 --> 01:29:21.820
(laughter)

2305
01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:26.320
MATT: We'll come back with whatever this thing is.

2306
01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.477
MARISHA: We're going to be fighting all night.

2307
01:29:28.477 --> 01:29:29.502
ASHLEY: Let's just do it that way.

2308
01:29:29.502 --> 01:29:31.720
SAM: We're all simultaneously master debaters.

2309
01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.197
LIAM: This is the battleground that lasted three weeks.

2310
01:29:36.197 --> 01:29:37.147
I love it, I love it.

2311
01:29:37.147 --> 01:29:38.610
MATT: We haven't done a good dungeon crawl in awhile.

2312
01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:40.100
This is an elaborate one, guys.

2313
01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.330
I hope you're having fun.

2314
01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:42.320
LIAM: Oh Jeebus.

2315
01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.420
MATT: We'll be back here shortly to pick up

2316
01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.180
with this moment of combat.

2317
01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:49.010
In the meantime, we do have our giveaway tonight.

2318
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:54.010
We have the rock maple wood from our friends at

2319
01:29:54.026 --> 01:29:56.026
Wyrmwood made this dice vault.

2320
01:29:56.026 --> 01:29:57.310
This is the Mountain Dwarf, so you can see

2321
01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:59.250
the actual runes on the front.

2322
01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:01.350
This is for keeping your dice in, it's magnetic.

2323
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:04.030
It's awesome and one of you lucky folks will win this.

2324
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:05.450
MARISHA: It's super cool.

2325
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:07.650
MATT: It has a granite inlay which is fun.

2326
01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:12.040
Tonight's key word is mirror, M-I-R-R-O-R.

2327
01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.690
So enter the word mirror once.

2328
01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:16.420
More than once and you'll be disqualified, into our chat.

2329
01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.730
For folks in the US and Canada, excluding Quebec,

2330
01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:20.250
you have the chance to win this when we return

2331
01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:21.083
from our break.

2332
01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:22.110
We'll see you here shortly.

2333
01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:25.007

(loud rumbling)

2354
01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.170
BINWIN: Hi, I'm Binwin Bronzebottom, celebrity dwarf

2355
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:28.060
and video game enthusiast and this is my sidekick Crowy.

2356
01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:28.893
CROWY: Hello.

2357
01:31:28.893 --> 01:31:29.726
BINWIN: We're here to tell you about

2358
01:31:29.726 --> 01:31:31.660
Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms

2359
01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:34.090
a Dungeons &amp; Dragons based strategy management game

2360
01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:35.630
from Codename Entertainment.

2361
01:31:35.630 --> 01:31:37.640
They're Canadian, so you know it's good.

2362
01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:38.820
CROWY: Let's talk about the game.

2363
01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.140
Did you ever play Cookie Clicker?

2364
01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:40.990
BINWIN: Of course not.

2365
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:42.670
CROWY: This game is a management game like that

2366
01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:44.670
but with far more emphasis on strategy.

2367
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:47.060
And with the flavoring of D&amp;D's lore and legendary heroes,

2368
01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:49.220
you can unlock your favorite champions like Farideh

2369
01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.460
from Erin M. Evans' Brimstone Angels saga.

2370
01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.970
Minsc and Boo from Baldur's Gate.

2371
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:54.110
And the fourth and final member

2372
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:55.830
of Acquisitions Incorporated, the C Team,

2373
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:58.490
Amy Falcone's Walnut Dankgrass.

2374
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:59.450
BINWIN: The K is silent.

2375
01:31:59.450 --> 01:32:01.810
CROWY: Create the best adventuring party possible based

2376
01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:04.050
on formation options, your character's ability,

2377
01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:05.660
and the obstacles and enemies you face.

2378
01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:07.800
BINWIN: Or you just randomly click on things like I do

2379
01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:08.650
and hope for the best.

2380
01:32:08.650 --> 01:32:10.510
CROWY: You can click on enemies to assist your champions,

2381
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:11.910
or you can set 'em up and walk away

2382
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:12.810
and let 'em do their thing.

2383
01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:14.200
It's entirely up to you.

2384
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.660
BINWIN: I'm playing on the toilet right now.

2385
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:16.900
CROWY: Why wouldn't you be?

2386
01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:18.130
Idle Champions is available

2387
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:19.800
on all your favorite gaming platforms,

2388
01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.990
including tablets, for the low, low price of free.

2389
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:23.950
So download it now.

2390
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:24.870
BINWIN: End with joke.

2391
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:25.703
CROWY: You're not supposed to read that.

2392
01:32:25.703 --> 01:32:26.536
BINWIN: It says "End with joke."

2393
01:32:26.536 --> 01:32:27.900
CROWY: No, we're supposed to come up with a joke

2394
01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.860
to go with where it says "End with joke."

2395
01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.760
BINWIN: I don't know, end with joke is pretty funny.

2396
01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.290
CROWY: Wait, on three, ready?
BINWIN: Yeah.

2397
01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:34.780
CROWY: One, two, three.

2398
01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:35.751
BOTH: End with joke.

2399
01:32:35.751 --> 01:32:37.160
(laughter)

2400
01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.510
BINWIN: I think it's funny, it's very funny.

2401
01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.488
DANI (V.O.): Delightful.

2402
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.293
Unrivaled.

2403
01:32:50.683 --> 01:32:52.208
Beauteous.

2404
01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:55.530
Sublime.

2405
01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:00.108
Ceramic.

2406
01:33:03.382 --> 01:33:06.207
TRAVIS (V.O.): (as Grog) ♪ The best part of this mug ♪

2407
01:33:06.207 --> 01:33:08.515
♪ is that it can hold ale ♪

2408
01:33:08.515 --> 01:33:10.682
(giggles)

2409
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:14.450
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

2410
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:15.830
LIAM: Okay, that's good.

2411
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:17.230
Yep, you're good.

2412
01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:20.710
BRIAN: I feel better about that.

2413
01:33:20.710 --> 01:33:22.860
ASHLEY: I feel great about it.

2414
01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:24.310
BRIAN: It's doing some weird shit

2415
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:25.143
to me, you know, because--

2416
01:33:25.143 --> 01:33:27.970
LIAM: Brian, that's all yours for a couple more days.

2417
01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:30.020
ASHLEY: Yep.
BRIAN: Don't remind me.

2418
01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:32.700
Yeah, this is your last Talks for a little bit.

2419
01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.150
ASHLEY: This is my last Talks for a little bit.

2420
01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:36.010
BRIAN: And then Episode 69 this week will be

2421
01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:37.900
your last CR for a little bit.

2422
01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:38.733
That's a bummer.

2423
01:33:38.733 --> 01:33:40.970
Sorry, folks.
ASHLEY: It is a bummer.

2424
01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:43.855
LIAM: Good one to go down on, I mean, out on.

2425
01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:45.813
DANI: That was good.

2426
01:33:45.813 --> 01:33:47.850
BRIAN: We're going to finish soon, I mean, finish strong.

2427
01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:49.840
LIAM: He, he did sort of like a homebrewed version

2428
01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.810
of the Gibbering Mouther which is just like the Thing,

2429
01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:54.030
John Carpenter's the Thing, it's a big blob with mouths

2430
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.863
and teeth and eyes.

2431
01:33:54.863 --> 01:33:56.370
ASHLEY: Wait no, what are blondies?

2432
01:33:56.370 --> 01:33:57.550
LIAM: Oh, I thought you said...

2433
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:58.520
You did say blondies.

2434
01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.950
Blondies are like chocolate chip cookie brownies.

2435
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:04.530
ASHLEY: Oh, there's like chocolate chip cookie in there.

2436
01:34:04.530 --> 01:34:05.900
LIAM: Yeah, it's like a golden cake.

2437
01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:06.770
ASHLEY: Why are they called blondies?

2438
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:08.030
You're a blondie.

2439
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:10.900
BRIAN: When we get Domino's and I get that...

2440
01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.980
One of the places and I get that--

2441
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:15.050
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and it has the cookie in there.

2442
01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:16.092
Ooh, it's delish.

2443
01:34:16.092 --> 01:34:17.460
Yeah, now I want cookies.
LIAM: Let's go.

2444
01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:18.420
BRIAN: Is Jerry still here?

2445
01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:21.270
Can he get us a giant cookie?

2446
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:24.208
Jerry, do you want to run out and get a cookie?

2447
01:34:24.208 --> 01:34:25.041
ASHLEY and JERRY: No.

2448
01:34:25.041 --> 01:34:26.837
BRIAN: He said no.
LIAM: What about blondies?

2449
01:34:26.837 --> 01:34:27.670
BRIAN: What about a blondie?

2450
01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:31.070
Want to go get us a couple of blondies?

2451
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:32.280
DANI: Please leave him alone.

2452
01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.075
He's so tired.

2453
01:34:34.075 --> 01:34:35.530
BRIAN: Do you know what's cool?
LIAM: What?

2454
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:38.100
BRIAN: Cosplay of the week.
ASHLEY: Hey.

2455
01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:40.758
DANI: Cosplay of the week!

2456
01:34:40.758 --> 01:34:42.324
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2457
01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:47.053
BRIAN: Thank you.

2458
01:34:47.053 --> 01:34:49.880
Our winner for this week was sent in--

2459
01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.740
DANI: I was waiting for somebody else to yell

2460
01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:54.200
or to do anything.

2461
01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.250
BRIAN: We're off next week.

2462
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:57.150
We're all a little loose, right?

2463
01:34:57.150 --> 01:35:01.580

Max is a flat-earther, I found out today.

2474
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:24.970
ASHLEY: Dang, I didn't know that.

2475
01:35:24.970 --> 01:35:27.050
BRIAN: He had a--

2476
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:28.566
DANI: I'm not going to stop him

2477
01:35:28.566 --> 01:35:29.774
when he tries to kill you.
BRIAN: He had a windbreaker on

2478
01:35:29.774 --> 01:35:30.799
from the convention

2479
01:35:30.799 --> 01:35:32.680
that he was just at this weekend.

2480
01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:35.060
They said, "What a cool logo."

2481
01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.910
And he was like, "Yeah, it's a patch."

2482
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:38.140
And he took it off and he goes,

2483
01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:40.010
"It's flat just like the world, bro."

2484
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:41.210
LIAM: Yeah.

2485
01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:42.043
Yeah.

2486
01:35:42.043 --> 01:35:44.140
I mean, I know it's foolish, but I hate to naysay him

2487
01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.360
because it's the only thing that he gets passionate about.

2488
01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.550
ASHLEY: Yeah.
BRIAN: I know.

2489
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:49.610
It's definitely not his fucking work.

2490
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:50.680
ASHLEY: I didn't know he went to Flat Con.

2491
01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.760
MAX: There's no way it's round.

2492
01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:57.020
BRIAN: Yeah, he went to Flat Con.
ASHLEY: Yeah, Flat Con.

2493
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:59.806
LIAM: Max is a DPB flat-earther.

2494
01:35:59.806 --> 01:36:02.389
(laughter)

2495
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:06.397
ASHLEY: It's canon now, Max.
DANI: Congratulations.

2496
01:36:06.397 --> 01:36:08.363
BRIAN: DPB flat-earther.

2497
01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:10.880
LIAM: What are you using, are you using Jiffy tonight?

2498
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.360
MAX: Off-brand.
DANI: Oh no!

2499
01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:14.810
ASHLEY: Put the flat thing on him.

2500
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:16.555
BRIAN: What flat thing?

2501
01:36:16.555 --> 01:36:18.738
ASHLEY: The, the, the...

2502
01:36:18.738 --> 01:36:21.490
BRIAN: What are you talking about, this light bar thing?

2503
01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:23.923
Oh, you're talking Spurt.
ASHLEY: Yes, Spurt, sorry.

2504
01:36:23.923 --> 01:36:26.300
BRIAN: He has a name, babe, Christopher Perkins.

2505
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.080
ASHLEY: I forgot.

2506
01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.860
BRIAN: Chris, I am so sorry, man, I apologize.

2507
01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.390
ASHLEY: I was trying to--
BRIAN: I apologize.

2508
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:34.380
ASHLEY: Here, give him, give him

2509
01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:36.874
give him the Tusk Love book.
BRIAN: Okay.

2510
01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:38.630
It's so cute'ems.

2511
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:41.483
DANI: So cute.
LIAM: (like Spurt) Bye Spuddins.

2512
01:36:41.483 --> 01:36:44.399
In 11 days.

2513
01:36:44.399 --> 01:36:48.150
He loves toys, he'll probably chew on Spurt.

2514
01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:49.420
Come on, come on, come here.

2515
01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.143
LIAM: Welcome to our public access show about dogs.

2516
01:36:52.143 --> 01:36:53.920
BRIAN: Come on, come on, big boy.

2517
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.590
ASHLEY: This boy is available for adoption.

2518
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:57.973
BRIAN: No, he's not.

2519
01:36:57.973 --> 01:36:59.180
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding. I'm doing like a public access.

2520
01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.660
BRIAN: I know, but just don't tell people.

2521
01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:02.070
You'll give people the wrong idea.

2522
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:03.610
LIAM: You can have the 69 pillow.

2523
01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:05.287
Here.
BRIAN: There we go.

2524
01:37:05.287 --> 01:37:07.800
DANI: That's not going to be comfy on his face.

2525
01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:08.960
LIAM: This side will, though.

2526
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.460
BRIAN: Ashley.
ASHLEY: Yes.

2527
01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:11.600
BRIAN: Oh, that's a sweetums.

2528
01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.060
Are these words connected?

2529
01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:13.893
ASHLEY: Hold on and let me do this again.

2530
01:37:13.893 --> 01:37:15.540
BRIAN: You're just yelling verbs or something.

2531
01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:18.680
ASHLEY: Breaking away, a whimper escapes my mouth.

2532
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.750
As his kisses move down to my chin, my neck, my shoulder,

2533
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.340
gripping my sheet in his huge hand,

2534
01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.090
he pulls it down and I let it fall.

2535
01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.380
Even in the cool night air, I'm burning up

2536
01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.440
as his lips brush my collar bone and chest,

2537
01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:38.060
my exposed nipples stand so erect...

2538
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:41.140
DANI: Can we say that word on Twitch?

2539
01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:42.350
BRIAN: Keep going, keep going, keep going.

2540
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:45.080
LIAM: You're picking the most interesting syllables

2541
01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.650
to stress.

2542
01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:49.026
ASHLEY: Because I'm trying to make it acceptable

2543
01:37:49.026 --> 01:37:51.088
for Twitch.

2544

2562
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:07.780
strangely absent of streaming content.

Its patrons waiting for a way

2564
01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.550
to reach their Critical Role content.

2565
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:16.210
Travelers waiting to board the subscription train.

2566
01:39:16.210 --> 01:39:19.970
Through a twisting series of tubes and satellite waves,

2567
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:22.723
we here at Critical Role deliver digital content,

2568
01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:27.690
in the form of what society has come to know as "shows."

2569
01:39:27.690 --> 01:39:30.280
If you would like to view these "shows" on demand

2570
01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.300
after the live premiere,

2571
01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.345
you need to enter the shadow land known as

2572
01:39:34.345 --> 01:39:37.310 line:15%
the Twitch Subscription Zone.

2573
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:39.230
It is simple to subscribe,

2574
01:39:39.230 --> 01:39:41.540
but there are many paths one may take.

2575
01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:45.490
This Gordian Knot can easily be cut with a credit card.

2576
01:39:45.490 --> 01:39:49.110
However, if one has an Amazon Prime account,

2577
01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:52.637
you are guaranteed one free Twitch subscription a month

2578
01:39:52.637 --> 01:39:55.115
to the channel of your choosing.

2579
01:39:55.115 --> 01:39:59.510
But remember, freedom demands agency.

2580
01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:02.920
For Twitch Prime subscriptions do not auto-renew

2581
01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.050 line:15%
and you must resubscribe each month.

2582
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:08.160
For those already in the Subscription Zone

2583
01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.110
who want to spread their fortune,

2584
01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:11.970
you can gift tickets to the sub train

2585
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:16.170

2586
01:40:17.224 --> 01:40:18.575

2588
01:40:19.890 --> 01:40:23.383
There's plenty more room for Critters in the shadow land.

2589
01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:26.510
We here at Critical Role want to say thank you

including our emojis by Arsequeef.

2593
01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:39.240
And so ends another inexplicable journey,

2594
01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:44.100
a twisted car ride shrouded in fog with your high beams on,

2595
01:40:45.130 --> 01:40:47.230
a complicated parody promo.

[epic music]

2603
01:55:17.883 --> 01:55:18.960
MATT: And welcome back.

2604
01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:23.520
So before we get into the next leg of this combat,

2605
01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:25.530
we have our winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway

2606
01:55:25.530 --> 01:55:27.650
who gets the dice vault, the dwarven dice vault.

2607
01:55:27.650 --> 01:55:29.770
The winner is Default Prophet.

2608
01:55:29.770 --> 01:55:31.830
TRAVIS: Default Prophé.
MATT: Default Prophet.

2609
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:32.710
Congratulations.

2610
01:55:32.710 --> 01:55:34.360
We'll have that sent to you ASAP.

2611
01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:36.116
Now.

2612
01:55:36.116 --> 01:55:37.820
(laughter)

2613
01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.450
I've always wanted to do that.

2614
01:55:39.450 --> 01:55:42.530
So jumping back in where we were.

2615
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:47.170
So as the lid of the sarcophagus flies into the ceiling,

2616
01:55:47.170 --> 01:55:49.910
shatters in a cloud of dust and stone,

2617
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:52.970
you watch as a giant, pale, meaty hand, boof,

2618
01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:55.060
grabs the edge and the mist parts

2619
01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:58.459
as you see a hood and cloak,

2620
01:55:58.459 --> 01:56:00.800
deep brown and oily,

2621
01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.200
black-stained in places, rise out of it,

2622
01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:07.620
standing to a full ten feet in height.

2623
01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:10.830
The cloak obfuscating much of the torso,

2624
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:14.430
dangling just past the forearm area,

2625
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:17.500
where you see the one large hand lifting itself up.

2626
01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:21.680
You see just beneath the hood a bit of a sagging, open jaw,

2627
01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:23.977
sharp, broken teeth.

2628
01:56:23.977 --> 01:56:28.977
The skin pale, dirty, and

2629
01:56:29.318 --> 01:56:30.540
weirdly twisted

2630
01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:33.680
to look like some sort of horrifying mockery

2631
01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:36.700
of a human face, from just the bit you can see.

2632
01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.740
You see red-stained leather

2633
01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:41.130
that goes across the body and legs.

2634
01:56:41.130 --> 01:56:42.971
Heavy boots as it steps out.

2635
01:56:42.971 --> 01:56:43.929
(thudding footsteps)

2636
01:56:43.929 --> 01:56:47.710
The right hand is missing below the forearm.

2637
01:56:47.710 --> 01:56:48.730
And where the hand would be,

2638
01:56:48.730 --> 01:56:52.980
you see a long double-sided blade,

2639
01:56:53.970 --> 01:56:57.360
affixed and built into its arm.

2640
01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:59.160
LAURA: Oh shit.

2641
01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:00.360
Oh let's see, let's see.

2642
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.480
TRAVIS: Oh, what the fuck?

2643
01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:05.000
That thing is huge.

2644
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:05.833
Are you nuts?

2645
01:57:05.833 --> 01:57:08.079
LAURA: Oh no.
SAM: It's a nightmare thing.

2646
01:57:08.079 --> 01:57:10.830
ASHLEY: That is entirely too big.

2647
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:12.280
TRAVIS: You should see it from this side.

2648
01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:13.505
It's awful.

2649
01:57:13.505 --> 01:57:15.440
LAURA: Spin it around so I can see him.

2650
01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.669
SAM: He emerges and--

2651
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:18.937
LIAM: Hey, I just walked over to Travis!

2652
01:57:18.937 --> 01:57:21.130
(laughter)

2653
01:57:21.130 --> 01:57:24.700
SAM: He does a slow 360 so you can get a good--

2654
01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:26.500
MATT: He shows off his...

2655
01:57:28.110 --> 01:57:32.340
He walks to the edge of the walkway and pivots and turns.

2656
01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:34.060
All right.
TRAVIS: At least he's fabulous.

2657
01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:36.880
LIAM: It's like Kiri on steroids.
ASHLEY: Damn, I look good.

2658
01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.660
I had my beauty rest.

2659
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:44.660
MATT: As it emerges, Obann shouts, "Yes, child.

2660
01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:45.720
"Come.

2661
01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:46.570
"Join us."

2662
01:57:46.570 --> 01:57:47.403
TRAVIS: Please eat Obann.

2663
01:57:47.403 --> 01:57:50.470
MATT: And the creature just quietly looks up.

2664
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:52.590
MARISHA: Ozzy Osbourne that shit, yes.

2665
01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:57.590
MATT: It looks angry, but also weirdly grinning.

2666
01:57:57.626 --> 01:58:00.970
All right, that finishes Obann's action.

2667
01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:05.190
Obann is going to shift out of his space and fly.

2668
01:58:05.190 --> 01:58:08.310
MARISHA: So who do we go after first?

2669
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:10.960
MATT: Over, up above here.

2670
01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:12.568
Your...

2671
01:58:15.426 --> 01:58:19.300
spiritual weapon remains right there.

2672
01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:22.650
And that's going to finish his turn.

2673
01:58:22.650 --> 01:58:26.841
It is now the Laughing Hand's turn.

2674
01:58:26.841 --> 01:58:28.998
TRAVIS: Laughing Hand.

2675
01:58:28.998 --> 01:58:32.513
LAURA: He's made of cheese like The Laughing Cow?

2676
01:58:32.513 --> 01:58:33.963
MATT: No, not quite.

2677
01:58:33.963 --> 01:58:35.954
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.
LAURA: That was so stupid.

2678
01:58:35.954 --> 01:58:37.609
ASHLEY: You abandoned that so fast.

2679
01:58:37.609 --> 01:58:38.630
TRAVIS: Yeah, bail out.

2680
01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:40.538
LIAM: Guys, this is the kind of fight that

2681
01:58:40.538 --> 01:58:42.070
characters die in.

2682
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:43.228
Circle up.

2683
01:58:43.228 --> 01:58:44.570
MATT: It kind of seems to...

2684
01:58:44.570 --> 01:58:46.500
You don't see the eyes, you just see the hood hanging

2685
01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:48.690
in front of the face, the grin across.

2686
01:58:48.690 --> 01:58:51.920
Its weird, sallow jaw as it spans across.

2687
01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:54.630
It raises its other hand and you hear this

2688
01:58:54.630 --> 01:58:57.406
high-pitched whistle sound as it purses its lips together.

2689
01:58:57.406 --> 01:58:58.600
(whistles)

2690
01:58:58.600 --> 01:58:59.433
SAM: What?

2691
01:58:59.433 --> 01:59:00.690
MATT: As it raises its hand, you watch elements

2692
01:59:00.690 --> 01:59:03.340
of shadow begin to shift.

2693
01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:06.280
You watch as hound-like bodies emerge

2694
01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:08.222
from the nearby unlit corners.

2695
01:59:08.222 --> 01:59:09.480
TALIESIN: No.

2696
01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:10.313
SAM: What?

2697
01:59:10.313 --> 01:59:11.722
This is a bad, this is a bad.

2698
01:59:11.722 --> 01:59:14.940
LAURA: This is bad.
ASHLEY: This is the bad.

2699
01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:16.430
LAURA: No.
SAM: Oh boy.

2700
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:17.880
LAURA: Oh god.
TRAVIS: And he turned

2701
01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:21.655
on the dance floor.
SAM: Oh, this is a bad.

2702
01:59:21.655 --> 01:59:25.023
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me, oh god, oh god.

2703
01:59:25.023 --> 01:59:26.600
LIAM: What was that Caduceus line in the past?

2704
01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:28.200
We're running, it's bad.

2705
01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:29.813
TRAVIS: We're running, it's bad.

2706
01:59:29.813 --> 01:59:31.370
(laughter)

2707
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:32.870
SAM: We might have to run.

2708
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:34.880
MARISHA: We do need to figure something out.

2709
01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:37.335
MATT: The Laughing Hand turns.

2710
01:59:38.890 --> 01:59:42.000
Let's see who it turns to first.

2711
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.020
LAURA: Not me.

2712
01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:45.250
MATT: Yep.

2713
01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:47.940
It's going to step forward.

2714
01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:49.765
TRAVIS: God, Jester!
MATT: It looms forward.

2715
01:59:49.765 --> 01:59:52.060
Already used its action to summon these shadow hounds.

2716
01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:55.569
MARISHA: Why is it always you, dude?
MATT: But it looms up towards you

2717
01:59:55.569 --> 01:59:57.476
and just under its breath you hear

2718
01:59:57.476 --> 02:00:00.700
(sickening cackles).

2719
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:02.130
The shadow hounds go.

2720
02:00:02.130 --> 02:00:03.380
LAURA: Oh, he likes jokes.

2721
02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:04.865
He's happy guy.

2722
02:00:04.865 --> 02:00:07.025
MATT: This one's going to go ahead and rush up to Caleb.

2723
02:00:07.025 --> 02:00:07.858
LIAM: Oh.

2724
02:00:09.158 --> 02:00:10.590
MATT: The shadow hounds.

2725
02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:15.830
Both of those on Yasha are going to have advantage

2726
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:17.970
on their attacks with pack tactics.

2727
02:00:17.970 --> 02:00:18.920
LIAM: Pack Tactics.
TALIESIN: Fuck.

2728
02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.900
ASHLEY: Pack Tactics?
MATT: The first one.

2729
02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:22.080
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Pactics.

2730
02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.650
ASHLEY: That's going to be a 24 to hit.

2731
02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:26.290
ASHLEY: That doesn't hit, yes it does.

2732
02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:28.860
MATT: Second one, that is a 14 to hit.

2733
02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:29.850
ASHLEY: That does not hit.

2734
02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:31.410
MATT: So the second bite,

2735
02:00:31.410 --> 02:00:33.020
you manage to hold it back with your hand

2736
02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:33.990
and grab the snout.

2737
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:35.590
You can see its burning red eyes,

2738
02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:37.860
smoke, and black shadow energy

2739
02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:40.100
just drifting off of its body, this faint,

2740
02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:42.260
dull, purplish glow on the inside of its torso

2741
02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:44.680
just slightly lighting it from underneath.

2742
02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:45.990
As you push back the one snout

2743
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:47.270
and it's barking and snarling at you,

2744
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:50.390
the other one leaps on and grabs onto your shoulder.

2745
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:52.447
You take...

2746
02:00:56.930 --> 02:01:01.380
Pardon me, d4s are hard to pick up.

2747
02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:05.520
You take eight points of piercing damage reduced to four.

2748
02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:06.353
ASHLEY: Okay.

2749
02:01:06.353 --> 02:01:07.660
MATT: And I need you to make a strength saving throw for me,

2750
02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:10.510
which you have advantage on because you are raging.

2751
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:11.876
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

2752
02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:17.215
ASHLEY: Saving throw you said?
MATT: Yes.

2753
02:01:17.215 --> 02:01:19.480
TALIESIN: And you can add a d4 to that.

2754
02:01:20.541 --> 02:01:23.300
Oh shit, those are nice dice.

2755
02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:24.650
ASHLEY: 24.

2756
02:01:24.650 --> 02:01:26.050
MATT: 24, okay, yeah.

2757
02:01:26.050 --> 02:01:27.790
It tries to wrestle you to the ground

2758
02:01:27.790 --> 02:01:28.770
and you just pull out

2759
02:01:28.770 --> 02:01:30.200
of its jaws and ready yourself.

2760
02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:32.470
Both of them now snarling and getting low,

2761
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:34.340
getting ready to pounce in your direction.

2762
02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:36.280
ASHLEY: I show my teeth and I snarl back.

2763
02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:37.290
MATT: Good, good.

2764
02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:39.100
That finishes, now, Fjord, it's your go.

2765
02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:40.690
You can see the entity is now walking

2766
02:01:40.690 --> 02:01:43.460
across the center way towards Jester.

2767
02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:46.630
Its large, bladed arm probably close to six to eight feet

2768
02:01:46.630 --> 02:01:48.970
in length from where the blade begins to tip.

2769
02:01:48.970 --> 02:01:51.040
Kind of rearing back as it approaches.

2770
02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:52.422
What are you doing?

2771
02:01:52.422 --> 02:01:54.943
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2772
02:01:54.943 --> 02:01:56.140
♪ It's been awhile ♪

2773
02:01:56.140 --> 02:02:01.140
I will come down two steps so that I can see,

2774
02:02:01.148 --> 02:02:03.870
do we have a name for this Grim Reaper-looking motherfucker?

2775
02:02:03.870 --> 02:02:04.810
MATT: The Laughing Hand.

2776
02:02:04.810 --> 02:02:06.010
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

2777
02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:11.010
So I can see LH and I will fire two blasts of Eldritch Blast

2778
02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:14.390
into the side of its head trying to get its attention.

2779
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:15.498
MATT: Okay.

2780
02:02:17.310 --> 02:02:18.240
TRAVIS: 16 to hit.

2781
02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.590
MATT: 16.

2782
02:02:19.590 --> 02:02:21.840
Manages to like hit the cloak and burn part of it

2783
02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:25.170
but it doesn't actually impact the entity.

2784
02:02:25.170 --> 02:02:26.900
TRAVIS: And the second one is a 21.

2785
02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:27.733
MATT: 21 does hit.

2786
02:02:27.733 --> 02:02:28.566
Go ahead and roll damage.

2787
02:02:28.566 --> 02:02:29.760
TRAVIS: 21 hits.

2788
02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:32.140
Everybody hearing that. Okay, good deal.

2789
02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:35.140
And that's nine plus five, 14 points of force damage.

2790
02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:36.450
MATT: 14 points of force damage.

2791
02:02:36.450 --> 02:02:38.090
It impacts the side of it.

2792
02:02:38.090 --> 02:02:39.250
It barely moves it.

2793
02:02:39.250 --> 02:02:41.535
This thing is like a brick of muscle.

2794
02:02:42.710 --> 02:02:44.850
TRAVIS: A brick of muscle, would my--

2795
02:02:44.850 --> 02:02:45.880
MATT: It impacts and you see it like

2796
02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:48.951
just slightly shift from the blow.

2797
02:02:48.951 --> 02:02:50.290
You still have your bonus action and your movement.

2798
02:02:50.290 --> 02:02:54.500
TRAVIS: Am I 30 feet from the wingéd devil person ish?

2799
02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:56.008
MATT: You probably have to move a little closer

2800
02:02:56.008 --> 02:02:57.508
to get there. He's currently at this point

2801
02:02:57.508 --> 02:03:01.250
about 15 feet off the top there.

2802
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:02.170
You're on the cusp.

2803
02:03:02.170 --> 02:03:03.970
You might want to move a little closer to get there.

2804
02:03:03.970 --> 02:03:06.090
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll move up a little bit just to get closer

2805
02:03:06.090 --> 02:03:10.860
and I'll cast Hexblade's Curse, summoning shadows to--

2806
02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:13.120
MATT: On which one, on Obann or the Laughing Hand?

2807
02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.770
TRAVIS: Obann.

2808
02:03:14.770 --> 02:03:16.310
MATT: Hexblade's Curse is on it.

2809
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:20.210
MARISHA: Yeah, the magical flying dick is the problem.

2810
02:03:20.210 --> 02:03:22.750
TRAVIS: I came in for the last sentence and it was a winner.

2811
02:03:22.750 --> 02:03:25.008
That magical flying dick is a problem.

2812
02:03:25.008 --> 02:03:26.180
MATT: That finishes your turn, Fjord.

2813
02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:27.013
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

2814
02:03:27.013 --> 02:03:28.040
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

2815
02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:29.930
The barlgura on deck.

2816
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:30.763
TRAVIS: Got it.

2817
02:03:30.763 --> 02:03:32.150
TALIESIN: d4s on every attack.

2818
02:03:32.150 --> 02:03:33.660
ASHLEY: Okay.

2819
02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.710
LAURA: That's right, he can't die.

2820
02:03:34.710 --> 02:03:35.640
That's why he's in a tomb.

2821
02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.120
SAM: I don't think he can be killed.

2822
02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:38.240
TRAVIS: No.

2823
02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:39.073
MARISHA: Who?

2824
02:03:39.073 --> 02:03:42.960
LAURA: This guy.
SAM: The deathless detained.

2825
02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:46.722
The one who can't be killed.

2826
02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:52.030
MARISHA: Yeah, what was the...

2827
02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:55.070
SAM: "Let lie the King's instrument, deathless and detained

2828
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:56.380
"until the world ends."

2829
02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:57.320
He's just detained.

2830
02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:59.270
TRAVIS: Oh, well we'll just end the world.

2831
02:03:59.270 --> 02:04:00.627
SAM: We could put him back in the box.

2832
02:04:00.627 --> 02:04:02.520
LIAM: Sylas was deathless.

2833
02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:05.488
MARISHA: The box is fucking gone.

2834
02:04:05.488 --> 02:04:07.000
ASHLEY: He broke it open.

2835
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.600
LAURA: The box is gone, bruh, the box is gone.

2836
02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:10.570
MATT: Yasha, what are you doing?

2837
02:04:10.570 --> 02:04:11.403
ASHLEY: Okay.

2838
02:04:11.403 --> 02:04:13.470
MARISHA: Freaking broke the box, man.

2839
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:15.330
LIAM: Say hi to the Crawling King for me.

2840
02:04:15.330 --> 02:04:19.520
ASHLEY: I'm going to make my way over to him.

2841
02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:20.528
MATT: Okay.

2842
02:04:20.528 --> 02:04:22.852
ASHLEY: I know I'll get two attacks of opportunity.

2843
02:04:22.852 --> 02:04:23.685
MATT: Yeah.

2844
02:04:23.685 --> 02:04:24.900
There or you want to try and flank against--

2845
02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:26.150
ASHLEY: I want to flank.

2846
02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:26.983
MATT: Okay.

2847
02:04:26.983 --> 02:04:30.232
Both of them get attacks of opportunity against you.

2848
02:04:31.512 --> 02:04:32.345
MARISHA: Yeah.

2849
02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:36.177
MATT: Yep, since you moved out of the space

2850
02:04:36.177 --> 02:04:39.890
for both of them, they do get Pack Tactics on you once more.

2851
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:41.190
It's cocked.

2852
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:44.350
That is a 14.

2853
02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:46.540
That misses I think, I looked at your AC.

2854
02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:48.797
Next one is a 22.

2855
02:04:48.797 --> 02:04:49.630
ASHLEY: That hits.

2856
02:04:49.630 --> 02:04:52.160
MATT: All right, so the second strike does bite at you.

2857
02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:56.918
You suffer seven points of piercing damage

2858
02:04:56.918 --> 02:04:58.210
reduced to three.

2859
02:04:58.210 --> 02:05:00.050
And you just push out of the way,

2860
02:05:00.050 --> 02:05:01.110
pushing around the candelabra,

2861
02:05:01.110 --> 02:05:03.880
rushing up, and flanking the Laughing Hand.

2862
02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:04.713
What do you do?

2863
02:05:04.713 --> 02:05:05.813
ASHLEY: Okay.

2864
02:05:05.813 --> 02:05:08.140
TRAVIS: Remember your Reckless if you want to.

2865
02:05:08.140 --> 02:05:08.973
MATT: You don't have to at the moment

2866
02:05:08.973 --> 02:05:10.220
because you are technically flanking with Jester.

2867
02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:11.820
So you get advantage on the attack anyway.

2868
02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:13.450
You want to keep that in mind for future reference

2869
02:05:13.450 --> 02:05:16.170
in which you don't have that advantage.

2870
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:17.770
ASHLEY: Oh fuck, do I take out Magician's Judge?

2871
02:05:17.770 --> 02:05:19.720
Is he magical?

2872
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:23.878
Fuck, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2873
02:05:23.878 --> 02:05:26.667
MATT: Which weapon, Skingorger or Magician's Judge?

2874
02:05:26.667 --> 02:05:27.690
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out the Skingorger.

2875
02:05:27.690 --> 02:05:30.950
MATT: Okay, so, as opposed to the refined blade

2876
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:33.870
of Magician's Judge, you pull out the like arced,

2877
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:37.640
rusted, jagged, just front massive dual-handed blade

2878
02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:39.070
of the Skingorger.

2879
02:05:39.070 --> 02:05:41.240
Very Pyramid Head-like, actually.

2880
02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:42.798
ASHLEY: Okay.

2881
02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:49.870
Ooh.

2882
02:05:49.870 --> 02:05:52.090
Okay, that was a natural 19.

2883
02:05:52.090 --> 02:05:53.280
Plus eight, 27.

2884
02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.500
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

2885
02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:55.333
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2886
02:05:57.015 --> 02:05:57.848
Okay.

2887
02:06:05.966 --> 02:06:06.799
Okay.

2888
02:06:08.357 --> 02:06:10.290
MATT: Roll damage against him, it's your first strike,

2889
02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:13.230
so you get a full round of it.

2890
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:19.090
ASHLEY: Oh sorry, Divine Fury, I get to roll again.

2891
02:06:19.090 --> 02:06:21.270
TRAVIS: Oh, the strategizing going around the table.

2892
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:23.560
Fucking side convos.

2893
02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:25.120
ASHLEY: 14 points of damage.

2894
02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:27.337
MATT: 14 points of damage. Nice!

2895
02:06:28.593 --> 02:06:29.426
All right.

2896
02:06:29.426 --> 02:06:31.430
Carve through a big chunk across its shoulder.

2897
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:33.610
You see part of the cloak separate

2898
02:06:33.610 --> 02:06:35.370
where the wound cuts through and you can see the flesh

2899
02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:36.690
lightly bleeding beneath.

2900
02:06:36.690 --> 02:06:37.523
Your second attack.

2901
02:06:37.523 --> 02:06:38.356
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2902
02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:41.880
Natural 19 again.

2903
02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:43.673
MATT: Woo! Yeah!

2904
02:06:43.673 --> 02:06:45.649
ASHLEY: Do I get advantage again?

2905
02:06:45.649 --> 02:06:46.482
MATT: It's advantage for the second strike, yeah.

2906
02:06:46.482 --> 02:06:47.315
ASHLEY: Just to see if I get a 20.

2907
02:06:47.315 --> 02:06:48.950
Yeah, okay.

2908
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:50.110
Okay, so that hits.

2909
02:06:50.110 --> 02:06:51.210
MATT: Roll the damage on the second one,

2910
02:06:51.210 --> 02:06:55.040
it's just the 2d6 plus your strength bonus.

2911
02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:57.690
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I didn't add.

2912
02:06:57.690 --> 02:07:01.690
It's an extra three to that first attack.

2913
02:07:01.690 --> 02:07:02.770
So 17.

2914
02:07:02.770 --> 02:07:03.990
I'm so sorry.
MATT: So 17 on the first one.

2915
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:05.410
And this one is how much damage?

2916
02:07:05.410 --> 02:07:06.243
ASHLEY: Okay.

2917
02:07:06.243 --> 02:07:08.180
Six.

2918
02:07:12.392 --> 02:07:13.225
I'm going to try Savage Attacker

2919
02:07:13.225 --> 02:07:14.433
to see if I can get it higher.

2920
02:07:14.433 --> 02:07:15.821
MATT: Okay.

2921
02:07:15.821 --> 02:07:18.780
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, that's better.

2922
02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.520
12 points for the second hit.

2923
02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:21.960
MATT: 12 points, nice.

2924
02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:22.793
You carve.

2925
02:07:22.793 --> 02:07:24.430
This one carves like the back of its hand.

2926
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:26.870
It tries to pull back after the first blow to reach out

2927
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:28.520
and your blade just cuts across the forearm.

2928
02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:30.830
You can see the large slit where it leaves it.

2929
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:31.663
That finishes your turn?

2930
02:07:31.663 --> 02:07:34.150
You still have a bonus action.

2931
02:07:34.150 --> 02:07:36.210
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to stay.
MATT: Okay.

2932
02:07:36.210 --> 02:07:37.660
Finishes Yasha's go.

2933
02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:39.320
The barlgura's turn.

2934
02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:43.790
TRAVIS: The barlgura will rush up to the back

2935
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:46.543
of the Laughing Hand.

2936
02:07:49.547 --> 02:07:54.180
And it will use both of, well, if it has three attacks,

2937
02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:57.160
I guess I'll just try and grapple it again,

2938
02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.000
the Laughing Hand, not actually attack it,

2939
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.600
but try and--
MATT: Grapple it in place?

2940
02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:02.350
You got it. Go ahead and roll an attack.

2941
02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:06.670
TRAVIS: The barlgura has Reckless Attacks naturally

2942
02:08:06.670 --> 02:08:08.053
if you'll check me.

2943
02:08:10.450 --> 02:08:11.300
MATT: Which says...

2944
02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:12.730
TRAVIS: It says at the start of its turn the barlgura

2945
02:08:12.730 --> 02:08:15.290
can gain advantage on melee weapon attacks rolls

2946
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:16.700
it makes during that turn,

2947
02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:18.160
but attack rolls against it have advantage--

2948
02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:19.450
MATT: Yeah, so it is the Reckless feature

2949
02:08:19.450 --> 02:08:20.283
that the barbarian has, too.

2950
02:08:20.283 --> 02:08:21.724
TALIESIN: You still add the d4.

2951
02:08:21.724 --> 02:08:23.502
MATT: And as far as for grappling--

2952
02:08:23.502 --> 02:08:24.831
TRAVIS: Good call on that shit.

2953
02:08:24.831 --> 02:08:26.280
MATT: Instead of an attack roll, it's a strength contested.

2954
02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:27.250
So roll a strength check.

2955
02:08:27.250 --> 02:08:28.120
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: It's contested

2956
02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:29.420
against the Laughing Hand.

2957
02:08:31.361 --> 02:08:33.069
TRAVIS: That is an 18 plus four,

2958
02:08:33.069 --> 02:08:36.500
is a 22 with a Bless of 26 total.

2959
02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:38.070
MATT: 26.

2960
02:08:38.070 --> 02:08:39.450
Rolled a 24.

2961
02:08:39.450 --> 02:08:40.740
It is grappled.

2962
02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:42.240
LAURA: Yay, yay, yay.
SAM: Oh wow, that's good.

2963
02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:43.940
ASHLEY: Hell yes.
TRAVIS: Yeah, so the barlgura

2964
02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:48.450
comes up behind and goes (growls) and just clasps its arms

2965
02:08:48.450 --> 02:08:50.116
together around it.

2966
02:08:50.116 --> 02:08:52.790
MATT: Grabs it, okay, that's its first attack.

2967
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:54.990
TRAVIS: And can he fucking bite into the back of its neck?

2968
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:56.405
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

2969
02:08:56.405 --> 02:08:59.072
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2970
02:09:00.012 --> 02:09:03.027
Plus seven to hit, that's a 26 to hit.

2971
02:09:03.027 --> 02:09:04.080
MATT: 26 to hit hits, yeah.

2972
02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:04.913
Go ahead and roll damage.

2973
02:09:04.913 --> 02:09:07.800
TRAVIS: 2d6 plus four.

2974
02:09:11.778 --> 02:09:14.716
SAM: So we're focusing on the big undead guy--

2975
02:09:14.716 --> 02:09:16.870
TRAVIS: Ten points of piercing damage.

2976
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:18.090
MATT: Ten points of piercing damage.

2977
02:09:18.090 --> 02:09:19.740
TRAVIS: No, I'm just trying to keep him from fucking

2978
02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:22.200
cutting Jester in half with that goddamn arm scythe.

2979
02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:24.080
MATT: It bites into the side of its throat

2980
02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:26.530
through the cloth, piercing it, and digging into the side

2981
02:09:26.530 --> 02:09:29.990
of its shoulder, it's like, rummages a bit.

2982
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:33.040
But it makes very little noise other than the low chuckling.

2983
02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:35.150
And that has three attacks that the barlgura has?

2984
02:09:35.150 --> 02:09:36.070
TRAVIS: It does have three.

2985
02:09:36.070 --> 02:09:37.180
MATT: Yeah, so roll the other--

2986
02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:38.500
TRAVIS: The grapple didn't count as two?

2987
02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:39.333
MATT: Well, the grapple is,

2988
02:09:39.333 --> 02:09:40.890
you use one attack to try and grapple.

2989
02:09:40.890 --> 02:09:42.498
TRAVIS: Great, I'll do another, just a fucking another

2990
02:09:42.498 --> 02:09:44.270
bite attack.

2991
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:47.960
That is a plus seven, so that's 25.

2992
02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:49.850
MATT: 25 does hit, go ahead and roll damage.

2993
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:52.323
TRAVIS: 2d6.

2994
02:09:52.323 --> 02:09:53.890
Five.

2995
02:09:53.890 --> 02:09:55.640
Oh that's six, six point of piercing damage.

2996
02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:57.720
MATT: Six points of piercing damage, you got it.

2997
02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:59.660
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, nine points of piercing damage.

2998
02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:01.180
MATT: Okay, so it bites him a second time.

2999
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:04.150
It's digging and just tearing into this hulking beast

3000
02:10:04.150 --> 02:10:06.220
versus hulking creature.

3001
02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:07.600
That finishes its go.

3002
02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:10.090
That brings us to Beau and Caleb.

3003
02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:11.460
Beau, you're up first, unless you want to hold

3004
02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:12.630
for Caleb's action.

3005
02:10:12.630 --> 02:10:13.640
LIAM: Whichever.

3006
02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:15.150
I went first the last time.

3007
02:10:15.150 --> 02:10:17.185
It doesn't matter to me because I don't know what to do.

3008
02:10:17.185 --> 02:10:18.670
MARISHA: I'll go then.

3009
02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:21.430
Okay, I'm going to try

3010
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:22.990
and pull some shit like I did before.

3011
02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:24.365
Can I...

3012
02:10:24.365 --> 02:10:27.710
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3013
02:10:27.710 --> 02:10:28.543
Yeah.

3014
02:10:28.543 --> 02:10:30.850
Can I try and run up these steps,

3015
02:10:30.850 --> 02:10:32.470
run up these guys, run and--

3016
02:10:33.609 --> 02:10:34.950
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

3017
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:37.010
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, let's go!

3018
02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:39.280
MATT: Just leap, parkour jump off one shoulder,

3019
02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:40.670
onto the second one.

3020
02:10:40.670 --> 02:10:41.503
MARISHA: 21.

3021
02:10:41.503 --> 02:10:42.740
MATT: 21.

3022
02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:47.550
You run, jump, boof, and land right about there.

3023
02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:49.830
MARISHA: I'm going to do a spinning roundhouse kick

3024
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:52.440
and shoot lightning at this guy in the face.

3025
02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:53.273
MATT: Okay.

3026
02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:57.170
He's just within your 20-foot range up there.

3027
02:10:57.170 --> 02:10:58.140
MARISHA: Okay, the first two attacks.

3028
02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:59.050
MATT: This is against Obann, right?

3029
02:10:59.050 --> 02:11:01.590
MARISHA: Those are both natural 17s.

3030
02:11:01.590 --> 02:11:03.720
So 27.
MATT: Yeah, both hit.

3031
02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:04.960
LIAM: You got to do that gymnast thing

3032
02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:07.970
on the railing with the hands.

3033
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:09.495
MARISHA: Eight damage for the first

3034
02:11:09.495 --> 02:11:12.020
and then Stunning Strike.

3035
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:14.710
MATT: All righty.

3036
02:11:14.710 --> 02:11:16.940
SAM: Not yet.

3037
02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:18.400
MATT: That is a 17.

3038
02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:19.370
MARISHA: Fucking saves from it.

3039
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:20.470
Second one.

3040
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:21.303
MATT: All right.

3041
02:11:21.303 --> 02:11:24.230
MARISHA: Second one.

3042
02:11:24.230 --> 02:11:26.220
Ten damage.
MATT: All right.

3043
02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:28.676
MARISHA: And Stunning Strike again.

3044
02:11:28.676 --> 02:11:29.509
TRAVIS: Do those cost anything?

3045
02:11:29.509 --> 02:11:31.300
MARISHA: Yeah, ki points.

3046
02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:32.133
MATT: 14.

3047
02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:34.480
MARISHA: My ki save is 15.

3048
02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.248
MATT: 15, all right.

3049
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:38.083
LAURA: He's stunned?

3050
02:11:38.083 --> 02:11:39.310
MARISHA: He is stunned.

3051
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:40.540
TALIESIN: Wait.

3052
02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:42.845
LAURA: Were you stunning the big guy or the--

3053
02:11:42.845 --> 02:11:43.678
LIAM: The big guy or the flyer?

3054
02:11:43.678 --> 02:11:45.370
MARISHA: No, Obann.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

3055
02:11:45.370 --> 02:11:47.550
SAM: Does that mean he falls or does he keep flying?

3056
02:11:47.550 --> 02:11:48.670
MARISHA: I don't know.

3057
02:11:48.670 --> 02:11:50.780
I was hoping it would mean he would fall

3058
02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:52.210
but I don't know.

3059
02:11:52.210 --> 02:11:54.970
MATT: Incapacitated means it can't take actions.

3060
02:11:54.970 --> 02:11:56.430
MARISHA: Advantage.

3061
02:11:56.430 --> 02:11:57.380
MATT: Or reactions.

3062
02:11:57.380 --> 02:12:00.630
So it can still maintain itself, he just can't move.

3063
02:12:00.630 --> 02:12:02.480
It doesn't say his speed becomes zero, so he doesn't fall.

3064
02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:04.530
TRAVIS: He's just going (hums).

3065
02:12:04.530 --> 02:12:05.363
MATT: Can only speak falteringly.

3066
02:12:05.363 --> 02:12:07.400
So he's like (groans).

3067
02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:08.900
MARISHA: Super fucking cool if I would have thought to do

3068
02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:11.566
that when I first hit him.

3069
02:12:12.964 --> 02:12:14.064
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

3070
02:12:14.064 --> 02:12:15.530
MARISHA: Bonus action, I'm going to turn around

3071
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:18.350
and Flurry of Blows the Hand.

3072
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:19.183
MATT: You got it.

3073
02:12:19.183 --> 02:12:20.016
Spinning around.

3074
02:12:20.016 --> 02:12:21.790
As a note too, each of these lightning blasts

3075
02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:24.950
that hit Obann, they're impacting, but the lightning

3076
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:26.642
isn't doing just as much damage as you're used to.

3077
02:12:26.642 --> 02:12:27.620
MARISHA: I was afraid of that.

3078
02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:29.156
I was afraid of that, too. Okay.

3079
02:12:29.156 --> 02:12:30.420
MATT: You've fought a few fiends in the past

3080
02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:32.630
that seem to have an inherent resistance against lightning.

3081
02:12:32.630 --> 02:12:34.770
TRAVIS: Freaking balls ass.

3082
02:12:34.770 --> 02:12:37.640
MARISHA: The first one is 26.
MATT: That hits.

3083
02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:39.890
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

3084
02:12:40.733 --> 02:12:42.120
MATT: How much damage is that, Beau?

3085
02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:46.245
MARISHA: Sorry, eight damage.
MATT: Eight damage, you got it.

3086
02:12:48.254 --> 02:12:49.900
MARISHA: And then Stunning Strike again.

3087
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:53.820
MATT: That is a 20, I'm sorry, 19.

3088
02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.610
MARISHA: Eh, yeah, yeah, no.

3089
02:12:55.610 --> 02:12:58.130
And the second one was 14 to hit.

3090
02:12:58.130 --> 02:13:00.142
MATT: 14 to hit, that does not hit, unfortunately.

3091
02:13:00.142 --> 02:13:01.950
TALIESIN: Was that with the d4?

3092
02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:06.680
MARISHA: No, it was not, good call.

3093
02:13:07.890 --> 02:13:09.730
17.
MATT: 17 does not hit.

3094
02:13:09.730 --> 02:13:11.950
TALIESIN: Oh well, didn't help.

3095
02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:13.180
MATT: The lightning arcs off it this time

3096
02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:14.820
and to him as well, the lightning is impacting

3097
02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:17.040
and shocking through, but still seems to be

3098
02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.070
not taking the full brunt that you're used to

3099
02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:20.170
with this type of lightning damage.

3100
02:13:20.170 --> 02:13:24.032
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast was what let that grapple happen.

3101
02:13:24.032 --> 02:13:25.370
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn, Beau?

3102
02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:26.203
MARISHA: Yeah.

3103
02:13:26.203 --> 02:13:29.040
MATT: All right, that brings us to Caleb.

3104
02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:31.440
LIAM: Okay, with one hand that is the bare one,

3105
02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.770
I extend a hand out and Cat's Ire flies through the air

3106
02:13:35.770 --> 02:13:36.780
towards Obann.

3107
02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:38.320
MATT: How far can it move?
LIAM: 60 feet.

3108
02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:39.657
MATT: 60 feet.

3109
02:13:39.657 --> 02:13:40.490
LIAM: And I'm going to swat him down

3110
02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:43.150
to the ground under next to Beauregard.

3111
02:13:43.150 --> 02:13:46.303
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: So strength contest.

3112
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:50.015
SAM: He gets to roll a strength?

3113
02:13:50.015 --> 02:13:51.220
He can't move.
LIAM: Yeah, I mean does he have

3114
02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:53.460
any kind of, you'll tell me.

3115
02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:55.060
MATT: He still resisted, he just can't take actions

3116
02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.702
or reactions.

3117
02:13:56.702 --> 02:13:58.510
LIAM: Just a 16, I rolled low again.

3118
02:13:58.510 --> 02:13:59.343
MATT: Okay.

3119
02:13:59.343 --> 02:14:00.240
And attacks against him have advantage

3120
02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:01.120
as part of the stunned feature

3121
02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:02.670
but this isn't an attack, so what'd you say?

3122
02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:03.870
LIAM: I rolled a 16.
MATT: 16?

3123
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:05.050
16 as well, so he saves.

3124
02:14:05.050 --> 02:14:05.883
LIAM: Oh.

3125
02:14:05.883 --> 02:14:07.450
And then with the other hand, which has got the glove on it,

3126
02:14:07.450 --> 02:14:09.170
I just unload right in the dog's face.

3127
02:14:09.170 --> 02:14:12.677
MATT: Let me check on the contested just to double-check.

3128
02:14:12.677 --> 02:14:14.600
TALIESIN: That'd be nice. That'd make life.

3129
02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:16.790
MARISHA: Do I have to hit with both Flurry of Blows

3130
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:19.240
for Extract Aspects or just one?

3131
02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:20.590
MATT: Just one.
MARISHA: Just one?

3132
02:14:20.590 --> 02:14:23.920
Can I get Extract Aspects on What's His Butt?

3133
02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:24.753
MATT: On the Laughing Hand?

3134
02:14:24.753 --> 02:14:25.586
MARISHA: Yes.

3135
02:14:25.586 --> 02:14:26.419
MATT: Yeah, okay.

3136
02:14:26.419 --> 02:14:28.210
So from the impact of the lightning

3137
02:14:28.210 --> 02:14:29.920
and seeing the reaction, you focus

3138
02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:32.540
on what little bits of its flesh you can see,

3139
02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:37.210
you know that it is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning.

3140
02:14:37.210 --> 02:14:38.420
SAM: Cold, fire, and lightning.

3141
02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:39.720
MATT: As well as bludgeoning, piercing,

3142
02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:41.980
and slashing from non-magical attacks.

3143
02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:44.193
MARISHA: Cold, fire, lightning.
MATT: Yes.

3144
02:14:46.210 --> 02:14:49.350
Coming to our discussion here, give me just a second.

3145
02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:52.990
LIAM: He's not a medium, is he?
MATT: No, he is large.

3146
02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:55.500
LIAM: Obann is large.
MATT: Obann is medium.

3147
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:57.790
Actually no, Obann, sorry, Obann is medium.

3148
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:59.190
LIAM: Then I have advantage so I can roll again.

3149
02:14:59.190 --> 02:15:00.570
MATT: Roll again.

3150
02:15:00.570 --> 02:15:02.080
TALIESIN: Yeah!
LIAM: That's way better.

3151
02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:03.310
That's 23.

3152
02:15:03.310 --> 02:15:05.470
TRAVIS: Yay, dirt wizard.

3153
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:09.907
LIAM: So right down next to Beauregard I'm...

3154
02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:12.080
MATT: Slams him into the ground.

3155
02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.896
He is now currently grounded for the moment.

3156
02:15:16.896 --> 02:15:19.920
Stunned and cursed by the Hexblade's Curse.

3157
02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:24.303
LIAM: And I'm unloading Scorching Ray into the hound's face.

3158
02:15:24.303 --> 02:15:25.136
MATT: Okay.

3159
02:15:25.136 --> 02:15:27.280
LIAM: So that's three attack rolls.

3160
02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:28.650
MARISHA: I shout out to everybody

3161
02:15:28.650 --> 02:15:30.840
about the cold, fire, lightning situation.

3162
02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:32.070
MATT: You can do that when it comes to your turn.

3163
02:15:32.070 --> 02:15:32.903
MARISHA: Okay.

3164
02:15:32.903 --> 02:15:34.161
I do that when it comes to my turn.

3165
02:15:34.161 --> 02:15:36.227
TRAVIS: Shout out.

3166
02:15:36.227 --> 02:15:37.660
MARISHA: Just want to give a shout out to this--

3167
02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:38.840
MATT: Unless you want to use a reaction to shout it,

3168
02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:40.890
it's up to you.

3169
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:45.501
MARISHA: Yeah. No, I'm going to wait.
MATT: Okay.

3170
02:15:45.501 --> 02:15:46.850
So what's that?
LIAM: 15 for the first

3171
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:48.100
of the three Scorching Rays.
MATT: Against?

3172
02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:49.410
LIAM: The dog that's right in front of me.

3173
02:15:49.410 --> 02:15:50.570
MATT: Oh, got you.

3174
02:15:50.570 --> 02:15:52.920
LIAM: Because it was a bonus action to start with Cat's Ire.

3175
02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:53.753
So 15 for the first.

3176
02:15:53.753 --> 02:15:55.960
MATT: Wait, this is a ranged attack?

3177
02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:57.200
LIAM: This is, yeah, Scorching Ray.

3178
02:15:57.200 --> 02:15:58.750
MATT: Yeah, so you have disadvantage on the attack rolls.

3179
02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:00.810
LIAM: Okay, so the next roll was higher.

3180
02:16:00.810 --> 02:16:02.570
So it still hits.

3181
02:16:02.570 --> 02:16:04.903
Okay. Second Scorching Ray.

3182
02:16:04.903 --> 02:16:07.020
Ooh, 11.
MATT: 11 does not hit.

3183
02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:10.470
LIAM: Third Scorching Ray is a 16.
MATT: 16 hits.

3184
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:13.860
So damage two of the Scorching Rays against the creature.

3185
02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:18.200
LIAM: Nine, 14, 20 points of fire damage to the hound.

3186
02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.675
MATT: You've got it. So two of them impact.

3187
02:16:20.675 --> 02:16:22.530
The fire burns across.

3188
02:16:22.530 --> 02:16:25.080
It seems to burn and take damage

3189
02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:26.220
but not as much as you'd expect.

3190
02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:29.677
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, fire is bad.
MARISHA: Cold, fire, lightning.

3191
02:16:29.677 --> 02:16:31.890
LIAM: And I'm going to run up the stairs.

3192
02:16:31.890 --> 02:16:32.723
MATT: Okay.

3193
02:16:32.723 --> 02:16:33.556
MARISHA: It's going to be like that

3194
02:16:33.556 --> 02:16:34.810
across the board, isn't it?

3195
02:16:34.810 --> 02:16:36.288
MATT: It takes an attack of opportunity on you.

3196
02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:38.370
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

3197
02:16:38.370 --> 02:16:40.250
MATT: That is a 16 to hit.

3198
02:16:40.250 --> 02:16:41.795
LIAM: Shield.
MATT: Shield.

3199
02:16:41.795 --> 02:16:43.902
Boof, reaction, Shield is up.

3200
02:16:43.902 --> 02:16:45.510
It does not bite you and drag you to the ground.

3201
02:16:45.510 --> 02:16:46.343
You keep running.

3202
02:16:46.343 --> 02:16:49.050
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3203
02:16:49.050 --> 02:16:50.537
That's as high as you can get there.

3204
02:16:50.537 --> 02:16:52.025
MARISHA: Good.

3205
02:16:52.025 --> 02:16:53.210
MATT: That finish your turn?
LIAM: All done.

3206
02:16:53.210 --> 02:16:54.180
MATT: You got it, all right.

3207
02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:59.080
Finishing that round, that brings us to Caduceus.

3208
02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:00.800
TALIESIN: I got a plan.
SAM: You do?

3209
02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:03.028
LAURA: Please.
SAM: That makes one of us.

3210
02:17:03.028 --> 02:17:05.828
TALIESIN: I got a tenth of a plan.

3211
02:17:05.828 --> 02:17:07.730
I got this much of a plan.

3212
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:12.730
I'm going to run up right next to Obann over,

3213
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:14.390
that just got knocked down on the ground.

3214
02:17:14.390 --> 02:17:16.290
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3215
02:17:16.290 --> 02:17:18.188
TALIESIN: And I'm going to whack him.

3216
02:17:18.188 --> 02:17:19.555
(laughter)

3217
02:17:19.555 --> 02:17:20.410
MATT: Do it, do it.

3218
02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:21.243
TRAVIS: With the staff?

3219
02:17:21.243 --> 02:17:22.740
MATT: You have advantage on the attack.

3220
02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:25.780
TALIESIN: Whacking with my staff.
LIAM: The special staff though.

3221
02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:27.200
TRAVIS: Wiener wack, let's go.

3222
02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:30.080
TALIESIN: Yeah, what is the, yeah.

3223
02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:32.650
SAM: Oh, it's the special staff.
TALIESIN: It is.

3224
02:17:32.650 --> 02:17:33.483
All right.

3225
02:17:33.483 --> 02:17:34.316
SAM: It's not just a stick.

3226
02:17:34.316 --> 02:17:36.160
MARISHA: Here comes Old Man Caduceus.

3227
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:36.993
TALIESIN: 16?

3228
02:17:36.993 --> 02:17:38.460
MATT: 16 does not hit.
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3229
02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:39.293
You're fucking kidding me.

3230
02:17:39.293 --> 02:17:41.382
SAM: With Bless or something? Are you Blessed?

3231
02:17:41.382 --> 02:17:42.315
TALIESIN: I am not Blessed.
SAM: Did not Bless himself,

3232
02:17:42.315 --> 02:17:43.148
unfortunately.

3233
02:17:43.148 --> 02:17:43.981
MARISHA: You rolled with advantage, right?

3234
02:17:43.981 --> 02:17:44.814
TALIESIN: I rolled with advantage,

3235
02:17:44.814 --> 02:17:46.280
but I rolled really shittily.

3236
02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:47.370
MATT: You swing.

3237
02:17:47.370 --> 02:17:50.110
You manage to impact the side of the wing

3238
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:53.470
but it just glides off, no actual impact.

3239
02:17:53.470 --> 02:17:54.960
TALIESIN: How much of my movement did I use there?

3240
02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:55.793
MATT: All of it.

3241
02:17:55.793 --> 02:17:56.626
TALIESIN: All of my movement to get there?

3242
02:17:56.626 --> 02:17:57.459
MATT: 30 feet to get there, yeah.

3243
02:17:57.459 --> 02:17:59.080
TALIESIN: I am right next to Beau though, right?

3244
02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.950
MATT: I can allow it so you are right next to Beau.

3245
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:02.160
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was my plan.

3246
02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:04.976
As a bonus action, I'm going to cast...

3247
02:18:07.743 --> 02:18:09.150
Holy Weapon.

3248
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:10.800
MATT: Holy Weapon, okay.

3249
02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:13.230
TALIESIN: Tap.

3250
02:18:13.230 --> 02:18:14.100
LAURA: Oh, that's great.

3251
02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:15.790
TRAVIS: Super Saiyan.
ASHLEY: Hell yeah.

3252
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:19.210
TALIESIN: You now have 2d8.

3253
02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:23.120
Also, you are a 30-foot radius light source now.

3254
02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:25.340
LAURA: Yes!
TALIESIN: And you have an extra 2d8

3255
02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:27.898
radiant damage on every hit.

3256
02:18:29.715 --> 02:18:31.496
Yeah.

3257
02:18:31.496 --> 02:18:32.870
Yeah.

3258
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:33.703
Okay.

3259
02:18:33.703 --> 02:18:34.910
MATT: So that is your melee hit.

3260
02:18:34.910 --> 02:18:37.670
So I don't think that adds to your ranged bit

3261
02:18:37.670 --> 02:18:39.110
because the lightning is what shoots out.

3262
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:40.760
The holy, you'd have to actually physically

3263
02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:41.593
hit them to do it.

3264
02:18:41.593 --> 02:18:43.670
MARISHA: Okay, copy that.
TRAVIS: Got to get dirty, dirty.

3265
02:18:43.670 --> 02:18:44.503
MATT: Finish your turn?

3266
02:18:44.503 --> 02:18:47.220
TALIESIN: That's an action, a movement, and a bonus action.

3267
02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:49.080
MATT: You got it, all right.

3268
02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:50.330
Top of the round.

3269
02:18:50.330 --> 02:18:51.820
Jester.
SAM: This is it.

3270
02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:54.050
LAURA: Don't say this is it.

3271
02:18:54.050 --> 02:18:55.530
Don't do that to me.
SAM: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3272
02:18:55.530 --> 02:18:57.100
MATT: At the start of your turn, Jester--

3273
02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:58.680
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

3274
02:18:58.680 --> 02:18:59.710
Oh fuck.

3275
02:18:59.710 --> 02:19:02.480
MATT: The creature is chuckling.

3276
02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.740
And there's all the wounds it took,

3277
02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:06.090
the slashing and piercing wounds that you can see

3278
02:19:06.090 --> 02:19:09.240
vaguely through the parts of its cloak that got cut.

3279
02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:12.798
You watch as the giant gash in its arm

3280
02:19:12.798 --> 02:19:14.300
grow teeth

3281
02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:16.550
and begin to start laughing.

3282
02:19:16.550 --> 02:19:18.940
And the piercing wounds in its neck turn into little mouths

3283
02:19:18.940 --> 02:19:20.525
and start laughing.

3284
02:19:20.525 --> 02:19:23.790
And every wound that's visible becomes a small mouth

3285
02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:26.100
and suddenly there's just a cacophony

3286
02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:27.635
of high and low-pitched laughs.

3287
02:19:27.635 --> 02:19:29.130
(chuckling)

3288
02:19:29.130 --> 02:19:33.160
All around, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

3289
02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:34.901
TRAVIS: When he puts his hands to his mouth,

3290
02:19:34.901 --> 02:19:37.301
it's never good.

3291
02:19:39.220 --> 02:19:40.140
MARISHA: It's true.

3292
02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:42.380
MATT: You're pretty good at wisdom saving throws.

3293
02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:44.169
LAURA: No, that one failed me before.

3294
02:19:44.169 --> 02:19:47.114
MATT: (chuckles)

3295
02:19:47.114 --> 02:19:49.240
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3296
02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:50.250
25.

3297
02:19:50.250 --> 02:19:51.480
MATT: Okay.

3298
02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:53.970
The laughter begins to cause your adrenaline to spike

3299
02:19:53.970 --> 02:19:56.270
and your fight and flight kicks in and you just shrug it off

3300
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:57.410
and you're fine.

3301
02:19:57.410 --> 02:19:58.480
What's your turn?

3302
02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:00.277
SAM: Whoa.

3303
02:20:00.277 --> 02:20:01.318
LAURA: Um.
SAM: That was it.

3304
02:20:01.318 --> 02:20:03.540
LAURA: I'm freaking out.

3305
02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:04.820
Freaking out.

3306
02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:07.560
I'm going to cast Mirror Image.

3307
02:20:08.610 --> 02:20:09.890
MATT: Casting Mirror Image, okay.

3308
02:20:09.890 --> 02:20:11.260
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: On yourself.

3309
02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:12.685
LAURA: Yeah.

3310
02:20:17.767 --> 02:20:21.525
MATT: You are now mirror imaged.

3311
02:20:21.525 --> 02:20:22.880
LAURA: You have one for it, that's cool.

3312
02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:26.140
SAM: The circle of Mirror Image.

3313
02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:26.973
MATT: Ah, fuck it.

3314
02:20:26.973 --> 02:20:29.250
LAURA: There's just so many fucking things.

3315
02:20:29.250 --> 02:20:30.630
TRAVIS: Oh remember, he's grappled.

3316
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:32.530
MATT: I'll put it there just as a reminder.

3317
02:20:32.530 --> 02:20:34.180
LAURA: Okay, oh, he's grappled still.

3318
02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:35.955
MATT: He is, yeah.

3319
02:20:35.955 --> 02:20:37.240
LAURA: I'm going to cry.

3320
02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:38.686
ASHLEY: You got this.

3321
02:20:38.686 --> 02:20:39.519
LAURA: I don't know.

3322
02:20:39.519 --> 02:20:42.220
I'm going to, as my bonus action,

3323
02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:43.070
it's probably not going to reach him.

3324
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:44.260
I'm going to try to get my spiritual weapon

3325
02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:45.820
to come down at it but it's--

3326
02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:47.950
MATT: Okay, how far can it move?
LAURA: 20 feet.

3327
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:48.783
MATT: It's 20...

3328
02:20:49.624 --> 02:20:50.700
No, it would've been 30 feet in the air.

3329
02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:52.400
So it doesn't quite get there.

3330
02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:54.991
But you bring it down, we'll say about--

3331
02:20:56.250 --> 02:20:59.044
- we'll say about there

3332
02:20:59.044 --> 02:21:01.260
is about as far as it can get to reach the ground.

3333
02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:02.660
But you get it there.

3334
02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:03.493
LAURA: Okay.

3335
02:21:03.493 --> 02:21:07.843
And I'm going to send my mirror images

3336
02:21:07.843 --> 02:21:08.926
like to scatter

3337
02:21:08.926 --> 02:21:11.180
and I'm going to try to dodge underneath his legs

3338
02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:13.450
and run towards Fjord's side of the room

3339
02:21:13.450 --> 02:21:14.980
while my mirror images go psh.

3340
02:21:14.980 --> 02:21:17.160
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3341
02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:18.760
You get over to that side there.

3342
02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:20.100
LAURA: Not next to the dog, though.

3343
02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:20.960
MATT: Yeah, I'll say you cross across

3344
02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:22.140
and leap onto that first step.

3345
02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:23.730
Just dodging the dog's space.

3346
02:21:23.730 --> 02:21:26.739
It does get an attack of opportunity against you.

3347
02:21:26.739 --> 02:21:29.116
TRAVIS: He's grappled, right?

3348
02:21:29.116 --> 02:21:30.341
SAM: Yeah.

3349
02:21:30.341 --> 02:21:31.310
MATT: He's going to go ahead and attempt to strike you

3350
02:21:31.310 --> 02:21:32.330
with the blade arm.

3351
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:34.030
TRAVIS: Does the grapple affect that at all?

3352
02:21:34.030 --> 02:21:36.920
MATT: No, grapple just makes his speed zero.

3353
02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:37.880
LAURA: Okay.

3354
02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:38.713
Yeah.

3355
02:21:38.713 --> 02:21:40.900
He does not hit me, it hits one of my duplicates instead.

3356
02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:42.290
MATT: Okay, so when your duplicates disperse

3357
02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:44.620
as the blade arm slams into the ground.

3358
02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:46.370
The stone breaks underneath, the tip of it.

3359
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:48.420
And one of your shadowy images vanishes.

3360
02:21:48.420 --> 02:21:50.170
LAURA: What did he roll?

3361
02:21:50.170 --> 02:21:51.003
MATT: Hm?

3362
02:21:51.003 --> 02:21:51.836
LAURA: What did he roll for hit?

3363
02:21:51.836 --> 02:21:53.038
MATT: 27.

3364
02:21:53.038 --> 02:21:54.838
LAURA: Yeah.

3365
02:21:56.629 --> 02:21:58.570
MATT: That finishes your turn, Jester?

3366
02:21:58.570 --> 02:22:00.870
LAURA: Um, yeah, I guess.
MATT: Nott, you're up.

3367
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:02.545
SAM: Wait, I don't know who I'm supposed to

3368
02:22:02.545 --> 02:22:05.220
focus fire on here.

3369
02:22:06.622 --> 02:22:07.455
Oh boy.

3370
02:22:07.455 --> 02:22:09.722
I don't think we can kill that thing.

3371
02:22:09.722 --> 02:22:10.850
MARISHA: Obann is stunned.

3372
02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:12.520
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to step up the stairs a little

3373
02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:17.280
and try to get a clear shot around the cat's paw somewhere.

3374
02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:18.790
I'll move if I have to.

3375
02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:19.730
MATT: Okay, I'll allow it.

3376
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:21.850
LAURA: The cat's paw is shimmery, translucent.

3377
02:22:21.850 --> 02:22:22.683
LIAM: It's floating.

3378
02:22:22.683 --> 02:22:24.560
MATT: You slammed it down on the ground.

3379
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:27.130
SAM: I will shoot Obann.

3380
02:22:27.130 --> 02:22:28.490
MATT: Okay, you have advantage on the attack roll

3381
02:22:28.490 --> 02:22:30.448
because he is stunned.

3382
02:22:32.050 --> 02:22:33.900
SAM: 13 plus ten is 23.

3383
02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:35.475
MATT: That definitely hits.

3384
02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:37.945
SAM: I'll sneak attack.

3385
02:22:39.519 --> 02:22:40.550
Not great.

3386
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:41.610
Not terrible.

3387
02:22:41.610 --> 02:22:42.990
Okay.

3388
02:22:42.990 --> 02:22:45.110
25 plus six is 31.

3389
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:48.330
I'll add Fury of the Small to that.

3390
02:22:48.330 --> 02:22:50.160
So that's 40, right?

3391
02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:51.500
I said 31 before?
LAURA: Yeah.

3392
02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:54.358
SAM: 40.
MATT: 40 points of damage, slick.

3393
02:22:54.358 --> 02:22:55.760
(groans)

3394
02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:57.560
As Obann's held in place trying

3395
02:22:57.560 --> 02:23:00.010
to shake it out after being slammed to the ground.

3396
02:23:00.010 --> 02:23:02.260
It takes the bolt (grunts).

3397
02:23:02.260 --> 02:23:03.630
Yeah, that hurt.

3398
02:23:03.630 --> 02:23:04.980
SAM: I'll fire again.
MATT: Okay.

3399
02:23:06.176 --> 02:23:07.190
With advantage on this because he's still stunned.

3400
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:09.460
SAM: Oh, still.
MARISHA: On everything.

3401
02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:11.670
SAM: Okay, 27 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

3402
02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:16.350
SAM: Four plus six, ten more points of damage.

3403
02:23:16.350 --> 02:23:18.910
MATT: Ten points of damage, nice, all right.

3404
02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:20.280
SAM: And then, if I have any more movement,

3405
02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:22.600
I will duck back into my little hidey nook.

3406
02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:23.934
Ah.

3407
02:23:23.934 --> 02:23:25.480
And take a swig of booze.

3408
02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:28.750
MATT: Okay, you got it.

3409
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:29.950
Yeah, you're not stealthed, though,

3410
02:23:29.950 --> 02:23:31.140
because you used your bonus action to attack.

3411
02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:31.973
SAM: Sure.

3412
02:23:31.973 --> 02:23:33.590
But you know, never know.

3413
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:34.640
Maybe they'll forget about me.

3414
02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:35.473
MATT: Maybe.

3415
02:23:35.473 --> 02:23:37.952
All right, that finishes your turn, Nott.

3416
02:23:37.952 --> 02:23:39.350
It is now Obann's turn.

3417
02:23:39.350 --> 02:23:40.183
He is stunned.

3418
02:23:40.183 --> 02:23:42.253
He can take no actions.

3419
02:23:43.170 --> 02:23:44.870
Can't move.
LAURA: It's the best thing.

3420
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:46.630
SAM: It is the absolute best thing ever.

3421
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:49.135
MATT: (sarcastically) Yeah, it's great.

3422
02:23:49.135 --> 02:23:51.481
I need to use it more often against you guys.

3423
02:23:51.481 --> 02:23:54.981
(nervous laughter)

3424
02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.100
All righty.

3425
02:23:58.100 --> 02:24:00.940
That finishes Obann's turn

3426
02:24:00.940 --> 02:24:04.355
until the end of Beau's turn, he's still stunned.

3427
02:24:04.355 --> 02:24:06.860
It is now the Laughing Hand's turn.

3428
02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:08.751
The Laughing Hand, grappled,

3429
02:24:08.751 --> 02:24:11.170
is going to turn around angrily.

3430
02:24:11.170 --> 02:24:12.110
SAM: Oh yeah.

3431
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:15.720
MATT: And unload into the barlgura.

3432
02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:17.001
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3433
02:24:17.001 --> 02:24:18.200
SAM: Didn't realize the Laughing Hand meant

3434
02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:21.290
it had hands that laughed.

3435
02:24:21.290 --> 02:24:24.798
MATT: Well, it has wounds that begin to laugh as well.

3436
02:24:24.798 --> 02:24:28.050
It's this horrible, screeching, like multiple voices

3437
02:24:28.050 --> 02:24:29.380
of different pitches laughing around

3438
02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:31.730
as you see the wounds opening and chuckling as they chuckle.

3439
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:33.205
LAURA: Ew.
TALIESIN: Gross.

3440
02:24:33.205 --> 02:24:36.920
MATT: That's going to be a 19 to hit.
TRAVIS: That hits.

3441
02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:37.753
MATT: All right.

3442
02:24:37.753 --> 02:24:41.250
The giant blade arm just coosh, slams into the barlgura.

3443
02:24:42.679 --> 02:24:44.504
It suffers...

3444
02:24:48.387 --> 02:24:50.490
18 points of slashing damage.

3445
02:24:50.490 --> 02:24:51.323
TRAVIS: Okay.

3446
02:24:51.323 --> 02:24:52.680
MATT: It's going to attack a second time

3447
02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:54.480
with its blade arm.

3448
02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:00.070
Oh, damn it, so that's a 29.

3449
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:01.203
TRAVIS: Hits.

3450
02:25:03.369 --> 02:25:06.270
MATT: It takes 23 points of slashing damage.

3451
02:25:06.270 --> 02:25:07.341
TRAVIS: Fuck.

3452
02:25:07.341 --> 02:25:10.110
MATT: And it's going to slam with its off-hand.

3453
02:25:10.110 --> 02:25:11.880
That's going to be an 18 to hit.

3454
02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:12.713
TRAVIS: That hits.

3455
02:25:12.713 --> 02:25:15.170
MATT: That hits. All right.

3456
02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:17.530
Takes 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

3457
02:25:17.530 --> 02:25:19.046
TRAVIS: Okay.

3458
02:25:19.890 --> 02:25:23.270
MATT: And that's its turn.

3459
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:25.500
TRAVIS: That's pretty good.

3460
02:25:25.500 --> 02:25:26.840
MATT: All righty.

3461
02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:28.830
SAM: How much fucking damage did he cause?

3462
02:25:28.830 --> 02:25:29.663
Total?

3463
02:25:29.663 --> 02:25:31.210
TRAVIS: 53.

3464
02:25:31.210 --> 02:25:35.084
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's almost a murder a round.

3465
02:25:35.084 --> 02:25:37.881
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

3466
02:25:37.881 --> 02:25:39.340
Yeah, that's pretty close.

3467
02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:42.060
MATT: Fjord, it's your turn.

3468
02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:45.423
You can hear the laughter emanating from it. It's not fun.

3469
02:25:45.423 --> 02:25:46.770
What are you doing?
TRAVIS: It's not cool, huh?

3470
02:25:46.770 --> 02:25:48.740
Okay, I'm going to go up the stairs

3471
02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:51.470
around the giant Garfield hand and,

3472
02:25:51.470 --> 02:25:53.190
actually I'm going to go around the back side.

3473
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:54.440
SAM: Mondays.

3474
02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:56.290
(laughter)

3475
02:25:56.290 --> 02:26:00.850
TRAVIS: And I will take two swipes at Obann.

3476
02:26:00.850 --> 02:26:02.130
MATT: Go for it.

3477
02:26:02.130 --> 02:26:03.440
You have advantage on these attacks.

3478
02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:05.770
TRAVIS: I have advantage, excellent.

3479
02:26:05.770 --> 02:26:07.800
First one is a 24 to hit.

3480
02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:09.620
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

3481
02:26:09.620 --> 02:26:11.310
LAURA: Why do I feel like I'm going to throw up right now?

3482
02:26:11.310 --> 02:26:12.960
ASHLEY: I know, I'm literally breaking out right now.

3483
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:15.910
I have two pimples that just popped up.

3484
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:19.860
TRAVIS: Oh, that's 16 points of slashing damage.

3485
02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:21.670
MATT: 16 points, nice, all righty.

3486
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:23.950
TRAVIS: Second one.

3487
02:26:23.950 --> 02:26:24.783
That's cocked.

3488
02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:29.080
That's a 25 to hit.

3489
02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.530
MATT: 25 to hit, that hits, yeah.

3490
02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:35.430
TRAVIS: Ooh nice, and 18 points of slashing damage.

3491
02:26:35.430 --> 02:26:36.430
MATT: Slick. He's looking hurt.

3492
02:26:37.490 --> 02:26:38.770
TRAVIS: Great.
MATT: He's looking hurt.

3493
02:26:38.770 --> 02:26:40.590
Both strikes slam through.

3494
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:42.220
The shadow emanating from the blade

3495
02:26:42.220 --> 02:26:43.160
from the Hexblade's Curse.

3496
02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:44.440
Each impact hits the body.

3497
02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:46.500
You can see the shadow like digging into the wound,

3498
02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:48.010
forcing the extra damage.

3499
02:26:48.010 --> 02:26:49.180
That's your move and your action.

3500
02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:50.013
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's it.

3501
02:26:50.013 --> 02:26:51.400
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn.

3502
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.340
Yasha, you're up.

3503
02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:54.330
SAM: Come on, Yasha.

3504
02:26:54.330 --> 02:26:55.530
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

3505
02:26:55.530 --> 02:26:56.530
Okay.

3506
02:26:56.530 --> 02:26:58.620
MATT: You now have this kaiju battle happening next to you

3507
02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:00.330
as the barlgura and the Laughing Hand

3508
02:27:00.330 --> 02:27:03.892
are just slamming into each other with attacks.

3509
02:27:03.892 --> 02:27:04.725
What are you going to do?

3510
02:27:04.725 --> 02:27:05.558
ASHLEY: Okay.

3511
02:27:05.558 --> 02:27:07.924
I am going to...

3512
02:27:09.024 --> 02:27:12.640
take an attack on the Laughing Hand.

3513
02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:13.473
MATT: Go for it.

3514
02:27:13.473 --> 02:27:15.690
Actually, at the beginning of your turn.

3515
02:27:15.690 --> 02:27:17.900
As the burbling laughter coming from its wounds

3516
02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:18.733
begins to fill your mind,

3517
02:27:18.733 --> 02:27:21.832
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

3518
02:27:21.832 --> 02:27:23.170
TRAVIS: You got this.
ASHLEY: A wisdom saving throw?

3519
02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:24.463
MATT: Correct.

3520
02:27:24.463 --> 02:27:27.717
You do get a plus d4 to it because you are Blessed.

3521
02:27:28.730 --> 02:27:30.380
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3522
02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:31.213
Oh.

3523
02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:34.700
ASHLEY: 19.

3524
02:27:34.700 --> 02:27:35.840
MATT: 19?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3525
02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:37.690
MATT: Yeah, you succeed.

3526
02:27:37.690 --> 02:27:40.940
You resist them trying to push their way into your mind.

3527
02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:42.100
You are still good to go.

3528
02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:43.350
So go ahead and take your attacks

3529
02:27:43.350 --> 02:27:46.160
against him if you'd like.

3530
02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:46.993
ASHLEY: Okay.

3531
02:27:47.919 --> 02:27:48.982
(groans)

3532
02:27:48.982 --> 02:27:51.649
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3533
02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:54.380
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3534
02:27:54.380 --> 02:27:59.050
That is a 24.

3535
02:27:59.050 --> 02:28:01.040
MATT: 24 hits or 24 damage?

3536
02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:02.380
ASHLEY: 24 to hit.

3537
02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:03.305
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

3538
02:28:03.305 --> 02:28:05.460
LAURA: Yay.

3539
02:28:06.745 --> 02:28:08.199
ASHLEY: ♪ I'm so stressed, I'm so stressed ♪

3540
02:28:08.199 --> 02:28:09.980
♪ Let me figure out my dice ♪

3541
02:28:09.980 --> 02:28:10.813
Okay.

3542
02:28:10.813 --> 02:28:11.690
MATT: The barlgura's on deck.

3543
02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:12.523
TRAVIS: Okay.

3544
02:28:14.252 --> 02:28:16.840
Would it be an action to like knock him prone?

3545
02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:17.740
MATT: Knock him prone?

3546
02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:19.720
That would be an attack, you can try, yeah.

3547
02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:21.210
TRAVIS: One of three that he has?

3548
02:28:21.210 --> 02:28:22.590
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3549
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:24.340
ASHLEY: 21 on the first hit.

3550
02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:26.560
MATT: 21 damage, nice.

3551
02:28:27.850 --> 02:28:28.683
SAM: Nice, Yasha.

3552
02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:30.880
ASHLEY: And I will hit him again.

3553
02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:32.438
Even though he's not going to die.
LAURA: Are you raging?

3554
02:28:32.438 --> 02:28:33.271
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3555
02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:35.680
Okay, wait, am I forgetting something?

3556
02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:37.660
LAURA: No no, I was just seeing if you're raging.

3557
02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:39.891
SAM: F his S.

3558
02:28:39.891 --> 02:28:41.613
ASHLEY: (groans)

3559
02:28:41.613 --> 02:28:43.066
A 16?

3560
02:28:43.066 --> 02:28:43.899
MATT: A 16 does not hit, unfortunately.

3561
02:28:43.899 --> 02:28:44.732
TALIESIN: You can add a d4 to that.

3562
02:28:44.732 --> 02:28:47.550
ASHLEY: Let me see if I can add a d4.

3563
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:48.510
17?

3564
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:49.590
MATT: 17 does not hit.

3565
02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:51.576
(laughter)

3566
02:28:51.576 --> 02:28:52.726
ASHLEY: Damn it!
MATT: Sorry.

3567
02:28:52.726 --> 02:28:54.300
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of there.
ASHLEY: Oh, I forgot about this one.

3568
02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:55.410
LAURA: Yeah, you got to run.

3569
02:28:55.410 --> 02:28:57.430
After you do these attacks.

3570
02:28:57.430 --> 02:28:58.820
ASHLEY: Um, um, um, um.

3571
02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:00.712
I don't know if I want to.

3572
02:29:00.712 --> 02:29:01.990
MATT: Up to you, what you doing, Yasha?

3573
02:29:03.531 --> 02:29:04.590
SAM: Remember, we have dogs too.

3574
02:29:04.590 --> 02:29:05.660
LAURA: Yasha, we got to get out of here.

3575
02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:06.493
ASHLEY: We got to get out of here?

3576
02:29:06.493 --> 02:29:09.760
Okay, I'm going to start, I'm going to try to disengage

3577
02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:10.593
and start running.

3578
02:29:10.593 --> 02:29:12.730
I'm going to start running away.

3579
02:29:12.730 --> 02:29:15.100
MATT: Two, three, four, five.

3580
02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:16.280
You can get that far.

3581
02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:18.600
You can't get up there because Jester's in the way.

3582
02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:19.610
ASHLEY: That's okay, that's okay.

3583
02:29:19.610 --> 02:29:20.880
MATT: It does get an attack of opportunity on you.

3584
02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:22.510
TALIESIN: No, it took its attack of opportunity,

3585
02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:24.330
didn't it, on Jester's clone.

3586
02:29:24.330 --> 02:29:26.090
LAURA: It did!
MATT: It did, but then it's had

3587
02:29:26.090 --> 02:29:27.930
its turn since then.

3588
02:29:27.930 --> 02:29:29.060
LAURA: It did.
TALIESIN: Oh, it did.

3589
02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:30.730
MATT: Yeah, so it gets its reaction back.

3590
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:36.380
That is a 15, that's exactly your Armor Class.

3591
02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:38.020
That's a bad roll for him.

3592
02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:39.832
All right, so

3593
02:29:39.832 --> 02:29:42.940
as you're rushing, the blade strikes you in the back

3594
02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:44.660
between the shoulders and it penetrates

3595
02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:47.670
about three or four inches right near your spine.

3596
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:50.450
You hear it scrape against your skin.

3597
02:29:50.450 --> 02:29:55.450
That is 20 points of slashing damage reduced to ten.

3598
02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:57.328
SAM: She's raging, it's fine.

3599
02:29:58.170 --> 02:29:59.836
MATT: And you move over there.

3600
02:29:59.836 --> 02:30:01.360
TRAVIS: That is way too much.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3601
02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:02.290
MATT: That finishes your turn, Yasha?

3602
02:30:02.290 --> 02:30:03.667
SAM: It's nothing, it's ten points of damage.

3603
02:30:03.667 --> 02:30:05.048
LAURA: To Yasha.

3604
02:30:05.048 --> 02:30:06.020
TRAVIS: To us.

3605
02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:07.140
MATT: Barlgura's turn.

3606
02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:08.340
LAURA: Kill him.

3607
02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:11.428
TRAVIS: The barlgura got fucked up by the Laughing Hand last

3608
02:30:11.428 --> 02:30:15.160
time and in a last-ditch effort will try to pick up

3609
02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:17.780
the Laughing Ham and slam him down onto the floor.

3610
02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:19.520
LAURA: I like the name Laughing Ham.

3611
02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:21.330
TRAVIS: Laughing Ham.

3612
02:30:21.330 --> 02:30:22.850
MATT: Go ahead, contested strength check.

3613
02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:24.810
TRAVIS: Okay, advantage, going Reckless for--

3614
02:30:24.810 --> 02:30:27.990
ASHLEY: Just a little honey-baked ham.

3615
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:29.873
SAM: Sweet little salt.

3616
02:30:29.873 --> 02:30:31.240
TRAVIS: 22.

3617
02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:32.510
MATT: 22, that succeeds.

3618
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:33.750
TRAVIS: Okay.

3619
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:35.370
Knocks him prone.
LAURA: Good job.

3620
02:30:35.370 --> 02:30:36.847
SAM: Yeah!

3621
02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:40.740
TRAVIS: And keeping the grapple on top of him,

3622
02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:43.350
he'll bite down twice with his other two attacks.

3623
02:30:43.350 --> 02:30:44.183
MATT: You've got it.

3624
02:30:44.183 --> 02:30:45.250
TRAVIS: Nom noms.
LAURA: What if we just keep

3625
02:30:45.250 --> 02:30:47.447
covering him in cuts and then he just turns into--

3626
02:30:47.447 --> 02:30:48.280
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

3627
02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:50.900
LAURA: Woo!

3628
02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:54.680
One giant mouth.

3629
02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:56.740
He's got nothing to stand on at that point.

3630
02:30:56.740 --> 02:30:59.320
SAM: Yeah, that's right, and he could develop gingivitis.

3631
02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:01.710
MARISHA: Oh yeah, go for his feet.

3632
02:31:01.710 --> 02:31:02.652
TALIESIN: Cavities, we could give him cavities.

3633
02:31:02.652 --> 02:31:04.580
SAM: Yeah, slowly die of gum disease.

3634
02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:06.440
LIAM: Use chains as floss.

3635
02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:07.770
TRAVIS: 24 on the first one, I'll write it down,

3636
02:31:07.770 --> 02:31:08.770
I can tell you later.

3637
02:31:08.770 --> 02:31:10.530
And on the second one.

3638
02:31:10.530 --> 02:31:11.380
MATT: How much damage is that?

3639
02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:12.520
TRAVIS: 24.

3640
02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:13.460
LIAM: Hey, guys.

3641
02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:15.010
ASHLEY: And just hold his mouth closed.

3642
02:31:15.010 --> 02:31:17.430
TRAVIS: And my second one is a 19 to hit.

3643
02:31:17.430 --> 02:31:21.330
MATT: 19 does hit.
TRAVIS: Does hit.

3644
02:31:21.330 --> 02:31:24.938
Ten, 14 points of piercing damage.

3645
02:31:24.938 --> 02:31:27.970
MATT: As it's slamming into it, with each bite,

3646
02:31:27.970 --> 02:31:30.110
you watch as it pulls away, the wounds open up

3647
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:34.280
into more laughing, tiny maws across its body,

3648
02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:35.870
the laughter getting louder and louder

3649
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:37.570
and more intense with each strike.

3650
02:31:37.570 --> 02:31:40.110
Also, the damage the barlgura has been doing to it,

3651
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:41.440
not as much as you think.

3652
02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:42.900
Its attacks aren't magical.

3653
02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:44.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he's a giant gorilla.

3654
02:31:44.450 --> 02:31:45.766
MATT: He is, and he's doing great.

3655
02:31:45.766 --> 02:31:48.211
(laughter)

3656
02:31:48.211 --> 02:31:50.360
That finishes his turn.

3657
02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:51.193
Beau, you're up.

3658
02:31:51.193 --> 02:31:52.310
LIAM: Eh, the humans are flip-flopping.

3659
02:31:52.310 --> 02:31:53.848
Caleb is going to move along that railing.

3660
02:31:53.848 --> 02:31:56.250
MATT: I will say because, just because it deals

3661
02:31:56.250 --> 02:31:58.680
with the stun at the end of her turn--

3662
02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:00.460
LIAM: Okay, leave it in place for this time.

3663
02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:02.590
Because I went first initially before that.

3664
02:32:02.590 --> 02:32:03.580
MATT: Because it didn't matter so much

3665
02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:05.670
because she's a higher dexterity, we'll say she goes first.

3666
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:08.080
TRAVIS: Did I roll a wisdom check at the start of my turn?

3667
02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:10.300
MATT: You are not close enough.

3668
02:32:10.300 --> 02:32:11.133
TRAVIS: No, the barlgura.

3669
02:32:11.133 --> 02:32:12.893
MATT: Oh, the barlgura? Yes, actually.

3670
02:32:12.893 --> 02:32:15.049
Please do that for me. That's a good call.

3671
02:32:15.049 --> 02:32:16.366
TALIESIN: Is it a wisdom save or a wisdom check?

3672
02:32:16.366 --> 02:32:18.165
MATT: Wisdom save.
TALIESIN: Add a d4.

3673
02:32:18.165 --> 02:32:18.998
TRAVIS: Okay.

3674
02:32:18.998 --> 02:32:20.630
12, 15.

3675
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:21.810
That's an eight, 15.

3676
02:32:21.810 --> 02:32:25.620
SAM: I have no idea what that monster's called, by the way.

3677
02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:27.540
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: 17, yeah, it's fine.

3678
02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:29.970
So you don't have to reverse the whole turn.

3679
02:32:29.970 --> 02:32:30.803
Yeah, we're good.

3680
02:32:30.803 --> 02:32:31.800
All right, so...

3681
02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:34.430
MARISHA: I'm just going to lay into Obann.

3682
02:32:34.430 --> 02:32:37.900
MATT: All right, so you move--
MARISHA: Do you want me to kill him?

3683
02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:41.200
SAM: I mean, you can control yourself to only--

3684
02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:42.900
LAURA: It's not like we're going to be able to collect shit

3685
02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:44.370
in this fucking room.

3686
02:32:44.370 --> 02:32:47.340
We're fucking--
LIAM: Six seconds.

3687
02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:48.600
SAM: Knock him down.

3688
02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:51.350
MARISHA: Pop, pop, with advantage still.

3689
02:32:51.350 --> 02:32:52.660
LAURA: We'll take his dead body with us

3690
02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:54.546
and ask him questions later.
MARISHA: 23.

3691
02:32:54.546 --> 02:32:56.104
MATT: 23 hits.
LIAM: That's the way to do it, see?

3692
02:32:56.104 --> 02:32:58.490
LAURA: Yeah, see?

3693
02:32:58.490 --> 02:32:59.323
MARISHA: Eight damage.

3694
02:32:59.323 --> 02:33:00.156
TALIESIN: Plus.

3695
02:33:01.120 --> 02:33:03.400
MATT: Well, it doesn't do any plus damage, just plus attack.

3696
02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:05.610
MARISHA: Oh wait no, plus--
MATT: Oh, from the Holy Weapon.

3697
02:33:05.610 --> 02:33:06.443
That's right.

3698
02:33:06.443 --> 02:33:07.640
TALIESIN: Plus 2d8.

3699
02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:08.680
MARISHA: Fuck, fuck, fuck.

3700
02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:12.246
Mm-hmm.

3701
02:33:12.246 --> 02:33:13.810
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

3702
02:33:13.810 --> 02:33:15.670
MARISHA: Plus another seven damage.

3703
02:33:15.670 --> 02:33:18.268
TALIESIN: Radiant.
MATT: All righty.

3704
02:33:18.268 --> 02:33:20.510
You got it.
MARISHA: Second attack.

3705
02:33:20.510 --> 02:33:22.695
22.
MATT: 22 hits.

3706
02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:29.550
MARISHA: That's six, 12.

3707
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:32.960
Six, sorry, hang on.

3708
02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:36.860
Eight regular damage plus another six.

3709
02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:39.050
MATT: So 14.
MARISHA: Plus another five.

3710
02:33:39.050 --> 02:33:41.830
So 19.
MATT: 19, you got it.

3711
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:43.320
All right.

3712
02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:44.490
MARISHA: How's he looking?

3713
02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:45.710
MATT: He's hurt.

3714
02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:46.543
MARISHA: He's hurt?

3715
02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:50.160
Flurry of Blows.

3716
02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:50.993
MATT: Okay.

3717
02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:54.007
MARISHA: Okay, first one.

3718
02:33:55.310 --> 02:33:57.320
Yeah, yeah, 25.

3719
02:33:57.320 --> 02:33:58.153
MATT: That hits.

3720
02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:02.220
MARISHA: 11.

3721
02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:03.060
Plus.

3722
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:06.670
Six damage.

3723
02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:07.503
MATT: All righty.

3724
02:34:07.503 --> 02:34:09.050
TALIESIN: Fight it on the way out.

3725
02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:10.049
MATT: Got it.

3726
02:34:10.049 --> 02:34:13.350
MARISHA: And. Mm-hmm.

3727
02:34:13.350 --> 02:34:14.183
28.

3728
02:34:14.183 --> 02:34:16.167
MATT: 28, Jesus.

3729
02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:19.380
MARISHA: Nine damage.
MATT: Monks, man.

3730
02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:23.350
MARISHA: Plus seven radiant.

3731
02:34:23.350 --> 02:34:24.516
MATT: Got it.

3732
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:27.160
Looking really rough.

3733
02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:28.130
SAM: Good, good, good.

3734
02:34:28.130 --> 02:34:29.170
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn.

3735
02:34:29.170 --> 02:34:30.840
MARISHA: Really rough, okay.

3736
02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:35.150
LIAM: Okay, Caleb is moving along that railing on the side.

3737
02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:37.630
Not at the front lip, but back towards where we came in

3738
02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:39.410
as far as he can get sticking to the wall.

3739
02:34:39.410 --> 02:34:43.800
And I'm going to use Cat's Ire to grapple Obann.

3740
02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:46.440
At advantage, 14, nope.

3741
02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:47.510
22.

3742
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:48.710
MATT: 22.

3743
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:51.580
LIAM: And then I'll use my bonus action to crush him.

3744
02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:54.400
MATT: Well, that is a 23.

3745
02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:55.233
He actually beats it.

3746
02:34:55.233 --> 02:34:56.100
LIAM: Oh, what did I get?

3747
02:34:56.100 --> 02:34:57.390
14 plus eight.

3748
02:34:57.390 --> 02:34:59.170
Oh, 22.

3749
02:34:59.170 --> 02:35:00.540
MATT: Oh sorry, no, 26.

3750
02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:01.373
I miscalculated.

3751
02:35:01.373 --> 02:35:02.810
LIAM: He rolled a 26?
MATT: 26, yeah.

3752
02:35:02.810 --> 02:35:04.390
LIAM: Jeepers creepers.
MATT: Natural 18.

3753
02:35:04.390 --> 02:35:06.230
LIAM: Then I'm done.

3754
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:07.860
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Bonus is gone.

3755
02:35:07.860 --> 02:35:08.860
TRAVIS: Oh, it's only if you grapple.

3756
02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:09.940
LIAM: Only if you grapple him, yeah.

3757
02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:11.120
MATT: Okay.

3758
02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:12.301
That finishes your go?

3759
02:35:12.301 --> 02:35:14.060
LIAM: Um.

3760
02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:15.363
Sure.

3761
02:35:15.363 --> 02:35:16.196
MATT: Okay.

3762
02:35:16.196 --> 02:35:17.464
LAURA: Do you have any other bonus action you can do?

3763
02:35:17.464 --> 02:35:18.857
MATT: Caduceus.

3764
02:35:18.857 --> 02:35:19.920
SAM: Is it an action or a bonus?

3765
02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:20.753
TALIESIN: Um, wow.

3766
02:35:20.753 --> 02:35:22.310
LIAM: Action to grapple.

3767
02:35:22.310 --> 02:35:24.420
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
LIAM: It's done.

3768
02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:25.600
Its bonus action's gone.

3769
02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:27.061
It's gone.

3770
02:35:27.061 --> 02:35:28.800
SAM: The cat is a bonus action.

3771
02:35:29.654 --> 02:35:31.890
TALIESIN: Look at this group of motherfuckers.

3772
02:35:31.890 --> 02:35:35.762
I'm going to...
LIAM: Oh, oh.

3773
02:35:35.762 --> 02:35:36.900
The cat is a bonus action.

3774
02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:37.733
TALIESIN: Yeah, never mind.

3775
02:35:37.733 --> 02:35:38.566
LIAM: So I have an action left.

3776
02:35:38.566 --> 02:35:39.399
MATT: So you do have an action.

3777
02:35:39.399 --> 02:35:40.250
I was wondering why you weren't using your action.

3778
02:35:40.250 --> 02:35:41.466
LIAM: Thank you.

3779
02:35:44.410 --> 02:35:45.740
Um.
TALIESIN: Fireball.

3780
02:35:45.740 --> 02:35:46.960
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

3781
02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:47.793
LAURA: No!

3782
02:35:47.793 --> 02:35:49.130
TRAVIS: Wait wait wait!

3783
02:35:49.130 --> 02:35:50.694
(low explosion)

3784
02:35:50.694 --> 02:35:51.840
MATT: It's not like it's unfamiliar territory.

3785
02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:53.450
TRAVIS: Akira the whole thing.

3786
02:35:53.450 --> 02:35:54.283
Boosh.

3787
02:35:54.283 --> 02:35:56.170
TALIESIN: Throw everything into the sun.

3788
02:35:56.170 --> 02:36:00.510
LIAM: I'm going to turn him into a turtle.

3789
02:36:00.510 --> 02:36:01.343
MATT: Okay.

3790
02:36:01.343 --> 02:36:02.690
LAURA: Not a giant turtle.

3791
02:36:02.690 --> 02:36:04.940
LIAM: A turtle.
MATT: A regular turtle.

3792
02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:05.773
I got it.

3793
02:36:05.773 --> 02:36:07.200
SAM: A giant acid turtle.

3794
02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:08.260
MATT: That is a what save?

3795
02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:09.093
LIAM: 17.

3796
02:36:09.093 --> 02:36:10.480
MATT: 17, 20.

3797
02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:12.598
(groaning)

3798
02:36:12.598 --> 02:36:13.648
SAM: At least you tried.

3799
02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:16.010
MATT: That finishes your go.

3800
02:36:16.010 --> 02:36:17.410
Caduceus, so what do you do on your turn, buddy?

3801
02:36:17.410 --> 02:36:21.901
TALIESIN: I'm going to fucking take

3802
02:36:21.901 --> 02:36:25.292
another whack at this guy, I guess?

3803
02:36:25.292 --> 02:36:26.520
Do I still have advantage on that?

3804
02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:27.353
MATT: No.

3805
02:36:27.353 --> 02:36:29.130
TALIESIN: Oh, because-- even if he's prone?

3806
02:36:29.130 --> 02:36:29.963
MATT: He's not prone.

3807
02:36:29.963 --> 02:36:31.050
He was stunned before.

3808
02:36:31.050 --> 02:36:32.300
TALIESIN: I thought he was prone on the ground.

3809
02:36:32.300 --> 02:36:34.070
TRAVIS: The Laughing Hand is prone.

3810
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:35.260
MATT: Yeah, the Left Hand is prone.

3811
02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:36.093
TALIESIN: Oh, so he's not prone.

3812
02:36:36.093 --> 02:36:36.926
Okay, that's fine.

3813
02:36:36.926 --> 02:36:38.176
I'm going to...

3814
02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:40.990
Oh, so he can actually get an attack with advantage

3815
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:43.160
if we disengage.

3816
02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:49.058
MATT: Actually, you are technically flanking with Fjord.

3817
02:36:49.058 --> 02:36:50.510
So you do get advantage on the attack if you want to do it.

3818
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:53.170
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, then in that case I will take a attack

3819
02:36:53.170 --> 02:36:54.010
with Staff of Withering

3820
02:36:54.010 --> 02:36:55.450
and maybe I'll actually hit this time.

3821
02:36:55.450 --> 02:36:56.283
Wouldn't that be nice?

3822
02:36:56.283 --> 02:36:57.730
MATT: Oh, the Laughing Hand's turn. You're right.

3823
02:36:57.730 --> 02:36:58.563
Thank you for the reminder of that.

3824
02:36:58.563 --> 02:36:59.396
TALIESIN: Oh.

3825
02:36:59.396 --> 02:37:01.160
TRAVIS: You're okay, you're okay. Keep going.

3826
02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:02.460
TALIESIN: 20.

3827
02:37:03.650 --> 02:37:05.120
MATT: 20 just misses.

3828
02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:08.290
TALIESIN: 20 misses this mother?
MATT: Yeah.

3829
02:37:08.290 --> 02:37:11.418
TALIESIN: I rolled a 16 and it's (whimpers).

3830
02:37:11.418 --> 02:37:13.020
MATT: I'm sorry.

3831
02:37:13.020 --> 02:37:14.100
MARISHA: That's your spell attack?

3832
02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:16.020
TALIESIN: That's my Staff of Withering attack.

3833
02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:18.570
Motherfucker.

3834
02:37:18.570 --> 02:37:19.403
Okay.
MATT: I'm sorry, buddy.

3835
02:37:19.403 --> 02:37:21.205
TALIESIN: That's okay. That's okay.

3836
02:37:21.205 --> 02:37:22.085
LAURA: Oh, Jesus.

3837
02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:28.311
TALIESIN: I'm going to then

3838
02:37:29.703 --> 02:37:31.300
take my movement.

3839
02:37:31.300 --> 02:37:32.133
MATT: Okay.

3840
02:37:32.133 --> 02:37:33.753
TALIESIN: I'm going to disengage.

3841
02:37:36.210 --> 02:37:37.660
MATT: You can't take the disengage action.

3842
02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:40.090
TALIESIN: No, I'm just going to back up and I'm curious

3843
02:37:40.090 --> 02:37:41.500
if he's going to take an attack or not.

3844
02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:42.720
And I'm going to start heading towards--

3845
02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:43.662
MATT: He is.

3846
02:37:43.662 --> 02:37:44.660
He's going to go ahead and take a strike.

3847
02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:45.493
TALIESIN: Sure.

3848
02:37:45.493 --> 02:37:46.810
MATT: He has an Abyssal longsword in his hand.

3849
02:37:46.810 --> 02:37:50.100
It's like dark obsidian stuff.
MARISHA: Sentinel.

3850
02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:51.180
MATT: Oh, that's right, yeah.
TALIESIN: Bless you.

3851
02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:52.338
MATT: Go for it.

3852
02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:55.893
SAM: Sentinel.

3853
02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:58.310
MARISHA: Sentinel, 24.

3854
02:37:58.310 --> 02:37:59.143
MATT: 24 hits.

3855
02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:03.180
MARISHA: Eight.

3856
02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:04.613
MATT: That is a

3857
02:38:05.705 --> 02:38:08.053
20 to hit.

3858
02:38:08.053 --> 02:38:08.990
What's your Armor Class?

3859
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:10.820
TALIESIN: 18.
MATT: 18, so it hits you.

3860
02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:13.610
MARISHA: Eight plus another seven radiant.

3861
02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:15.085
MATT: So that's 15, okay.

3862
02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:17.333
All right, yeah.

3863
02:38:19.975 --> 02:38:21.399
TRAVIS: We're wanting to kill this guy, right?

3864
02:38:21.399 --> 02:38:22.981
MATT: He's hurt.

3865
02:38:22.981 --> 02:38:24.740
TALIESIN: At this point?
LAURA: Yes.

3866
02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:27.760
TALIESIN: All right, so what kind of damage do I take?

3867
02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:29.580
MATT: So sorry yeah, so he did hit you with that.

3868
02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:30.720
You take...

3869
02:38:32.327 --> 02:38:34.595
SAM: Fiends don't disappear, do they?

3870
02:38:34.595 --> 02:38:35.428
LAURA: Sometimes.

3871
02:38:36.412 --> 02:38:37.750
Oh, no, no, no.

3872
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:41.270
MATT: You take nine points of slashing damage.

3873
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:42.800
TALIESIN: Ow.

3874
02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:46.000
MATT: Plus seven points of fire damage.

3875
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.690
As he strikes, the blade emanates an arc of fire.

3876
02:38:49.690 --> 02:38:52.210
It skins across your back. You feel the impact.

3877
02:38:52.210 --> 02:38:53.690
The blade, the cut, and the fire burning

3878
02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:54.790
into the wound as you run off.

3879
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:56.472
TALIESIN: Do I have to make a constitution saving throw?

3880
02:38:56.472 --> 02:38:57.665
MATT: You do.
TALIESIN: All right.

3881
02:38:57.665 --> 02:38:59.547
MATT: So that'll be a total of...

3882
02:38:59.547 --> 02:39:00.380
TALIESIN: 16.

3883
02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:01.213
MATT: 16 damage.

3884
02:39:01.213 --> 02:39:03.620
So yeah, so just go for it.

3885
02:39:04.890 --> 02:39:05.900
TALIESIN: 17.
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

3886
02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:07.120
All right, so you maintain your concentration.

3887
02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:08.461
TALIESIN: I'm going to back all the up to--

3888
02:39:08.461 --> 02:39:09.852
no, where to Caleb is.

3889
02:39:09.852 --> 02:39:11.780
I'm going to just get in the way of Caleb

3890
02:39:11.780 --> 02:39:13.750
so that if anything tries to run up on us

3891
02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:15.570
that it hits me and not Caleb.

3892
02:39:15.570 --> 02:39:16.750
Not behind him, in front of Caleb.

3893
02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:17.880
MATT: In front of Caleb, there?

3894
02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:18.920
Okay, you got it.

3895
02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:20.620
That finishes your go.

3896
02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:21.453
Jester, you're up.

3897
02:39:21.453 --> 02:39:22.286
TRAVIS: The Laughing Hand gets to go.

3898
02:39:22.286 --> 02:39:23.510
SAM: The dogs.
MATT: Oh, that's right, the dogs.

3899
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:24.343
Thank you.

3900
02:39:24.343 --> 02:39:25.176
Okay.

3901
02:39:27.293 --> 02:39:30.130
Yeah, they're all going to run up the wall.

3902
02:39:30.130 --> 02:39:31.255
SAM: Whoa, what?

3903
02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:34.480
TALIESIN: Oh fucking shadows.

3904
02:39:38.458 --> 02:39:39.291
MATT: 35, 40.

3905
02:39:40.341 --> 02:39:42.530
SAM: Damn, that's a fast speed.

3906
02:39:42.530 --> 02:39:43.800
MATT: They're very quick and you can see them.

3907
02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:45.220
They can climb on the walls without issue.

3908
02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:47.593
They seem to almost dive into the darkness

3909
02:39:47.593 --> 02:39:49.716
and then emerge and pounce.

3910
02:39:49.716 --> 02:39:51.166
So that's two against Jester.

3911
02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:53.580
TALIESIN: Does the radiant light spell

3912
02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:57.610
do anything to them from Beau?

3913
02:39:58.620 --> 02:39:59.840
MATT: Nope.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3914
02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:02.840
MATT: That is a 17 to hit.

3915
02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:03.673
LAURA: Oh.

3916
02:40:03.673 --> 02:40:05.140
I guess should I roll to make sure,

3917
02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:07.630
to see if they're hitting me or the duplicates?

3918
02:40:07.630 --> 02:40:08.700
MATT: Correct, if it hits.

3919
02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:09.680
What's your Armor Class?

3920
02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:10.650
LAURA: Oh no, he didn't hit.

3921
02:40:10.650 --> 02:40:11.590
MATT: Misses.

3922
02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:13.340
The other one is going to go ahead and strike you.

3923
02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:16.840
That is a 24 to hit.

3924
02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:18.500
So go ahead and roll to see.

3925
02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:19.600
LAURA: They hit the duplicate.

3926
02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:20.433
MATT: Hits the duplicate.

3927
02:40:20.433 --> 02:40:21.460
You have one more duplicate left, right?

3928
02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:22.920
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All righty.

3929
02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:25.340
That finishes their go.

3930
02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:27.020
Now, Jester, it's your turn.

3931
02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:27.853
LAURA: Okay.

3932
02:40:28.830 --> 02:40:30.856
Are they trapping me in?

3933
02:40:30.856 --> 02:40:34.080
MATT: I mean, you can't really go up the stairs.

3934
02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:36.618
It's blocking you.

3935
02:40:36.618 --> 02:40:38.900
LAURA: Okay.

3936
02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:43.858
Is the spiritual weapon 20 away from the one in front of me?

3937
02:40:45.170 --> 02:40:47.630
MATT: It could move to, mm...

3938
02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:51.500
Yeah, it can move over there.

3939
02:40:51.500 --> 02:40:53.609
LAURA: Okay, it's going to try to hit the

3940
02:40:53.609 --> 02:40:54.683
dude in front of me.

3941
02:40:54.683 --> 02:40:57.070
MATT: All right, go for it.

3942
02:40:58.730 --> 02:40:59.710
LAURA: Whoa.

3943
02:40:59.710 --> 02:41:02.520
Natural 20.
ALL: Hey.

3944
02:41:04.410 --> 02:41:08.950
LAURA: 14 plus, I think five is what it gets added to.

3945
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:10.280
MATT: Correct, two is the modifier.

3946
02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:12.455
LAURA: Yeah, so 19.

3947
02:41:12.455 --> 02:41:14.080
MATT: Nice!

3948
02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:18.330
As the shadow turns there, the lollipop hits it.

3949
02:41:18.330 --> 02:41:20.010
You watch the radiant energy scatter its form

3950
02:41:20.010 --> 02:41:21.944
for a second before it reforms back from the shadow.

3951
02:41:21.944 --> 02:41:23.488
(growls)

3952
02:41:23.488 --> 02:41:24.963
LAURA: Okay.

3953
02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:28.328
Okay.

3954
02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:31.341
I'm going to--

3955
02:41:32.758 --> 02:41:34.410
fuck.

3956
02:41:34.410 --> 02:41:35.918
Cast--

3957
02:41:36.827 --> 02:41:38.368
fuck.

3958
02:41:40.739 --> 02:41:44.340
I'm going to try to cast Banishment on the Laughing Hand.

3959
02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:46.330
MATT: Okay.

3960
02:41:46.330 --> 02:41:47.420
SAM: Sick, dope, dope and sick.

3961
02:41:47.420 --> 02:41:49.570
MATT: What's the DC on that or the spell DC?

3962
02:41:49.570 --> 02:41:50.600
It's wisdom, right?

3963
02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:52.710
LAURA: Charisma.
MATT: Charisma, got it.

3964
02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:54.640
LAURA: 17.
SAM: He's a handsome guy.

3965
02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:56.320
LAURA: He's handsome, he's very funny.

3966
02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:57.453
TALIESIN: Got a good laugh.

3967
02:41:57.453 --> 02:41:58.894
MATT: 27.

3968
02:41:58.894 --> 02:42:01.240
LAURA: Yeah, well he's--
TRAVIS: The Laughing Hand?!

3969
02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.950
LAURA: He's probably pretty--

3970
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:05.130
SAM: He's probably buffed up.
LAURA: Yeah.

3971
02:42:05.130 --> 02:42:06.190
Cool cool cool.

3972
02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:07.331
MATT: Rolled a natural 19 on that.

3973
02:42:07.331 --> 02:42:09.510
SAM: No.

3974
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:10.540
MATT: I'm rolling really well on those.

3975
02:42:10.540 --> 02:42:11.760
Not all of them.

3976
02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.370
Against the fucking stun.

3977
02:42:13.370 --> 02:42:17.860
LAURA: I can't even try to run past this dog or?

3978
02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:19.650
MATT: You could try and make a climb check and rush by

3979
02:42:19.650 --> 02:42:22.767
and climb up past it if you'd like to.

3980
02:42:27.330 --> 02:42:28.910
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try to pull a Beau

3981
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:31.140
and like dart out to the side and parkour

3982
02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:32.860
off of Yasha's shoulder and then jump over.

3983
02:42:32.860 --> 02:42:33.960
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

3984
02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:35.360
Or sorry, acrobatics check then.

3985
02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:37.450
ASHLEY: Can I help her?

3986
02:42:37.450 --> 02:42:38.880
MATT: Unfortunately, it's a help action to do that.

3987
02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:42.410
You have to use an action to do that.

3988
02:42:42.410 --> 02:42:43.243
LAURA: 17?

3989
02:42:43.243 --> 02:42:44.240
MATT: 17, sure.

3990
02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:45.830
I'll allow you to get on the opposite side,

3991
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:47.920
but that'll be the extent of your movement there.

3992
02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:50.360
SAM: Jester Lavoregard.

3993
02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:52.110
LAURA: That's all my movement to do that or?

3994
02:42:52.110 --> 02:42:53.160
MATT: Well, you can keep moving if you want to.

3995
02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:54.280
You will take an attack of opportunity.

3996
02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:55.610
Well no, it already used...

3997
02:42:56.666 --> 02:42:57.499
No, it hasn't used an attack of opportunity.

3998
02:42:57.499 --> 02:42:58.360
So it will get one from you.

3999
02:42:58.360 --> 02:42:59.820
LAURA: I'll try to run up though.

4000
02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:00.950
MATT: All right, so both of them get attacks

4001
02:43:00.950 --> 02:43:02.430
of opportunity on you.

4002
02:43:02.430 --> 02:43:03.263
They have pack tactics,

4003
02:43:03.263 --> 02:43:05.490
so they both get advantage on the attack.

4004
02:43:05.490 --> 02:43:08.079
That is a 15.

4005
02:43:08.079 --> 02:43:10.290
LAURA: Nope.
MATT: Misses.

4006
02:43:10.290 --> 02:43:12.320
That is a 19.

4007
02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:13.153
LAURA: Okay.

4008
02:43:13.153 --> 02:43:13.986
Hold on.

4009
02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:17.120
Aw, it hits me.

4010
02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:19.320
But that's okay, that means my duplicate is still up.

4011
02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:20.153
MATT: That's true.

4012
02:43:20.153 --> 02:43:22.710
You take nine points of piercing damage.

4013
02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:24.201
LAURA: Okay.

4014
02:43:25.220 --> 02:43:27.430
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn.

4015
02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:28.263
Nott, you're up.

4016
02:43:28.263 --> 02:43:30.370
TALIESIN: Get the fuck outta here.

4017
02:43:30.370 --> 02:43:31.870
SAM: So many people to kill.

4018
02:43:34.540 --> 02:43:35.930
We're still trying to kill Obann.

4019
02:43:35.930 --> 02:43:37.220
LAURA: Yasha, you've got to get out of there.

4020
02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:38.360
MATT: It's up to you.

4021
02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:39.193
What you doing?

4022
02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:42.400
SAM: I'll pop up out of my hidey hole.

4023
02:43:43.316 --> 02:43:44.149
LAURA: Ploop.

4024
02:43:44.149 --> 02:43:47.090
SAM: I will fire again at Obann just trying to drop Obann.

4025
02:43:47.090 --> 02:43:48.830
Is he still stunned?

4026
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:49.700
MATT: Nope.

4027
02:43:49.700 --> 02:43:51.000
SAM: So just a single roll?

4028
02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:54.000
TALIESIN: Well, he's--
SAM: Terrible.

4029
02:43:55.150 --> 02:43:57.410
14 to hit?
MATT: 14 misses.

4030
02:43:57.410 --> 02:43:59.760
SAM: Fire again.
MATT: Goes wide.

4031
02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:01.410
SAM: Okay, 24.

4032
02:44:01.410 --> 02:44:03.790
MATT: 24, Shield.

4033
02:44:03.790 --> 02:44:05.790
SAM: (gasps)
LAURA: I hate him.

4034
02:44:05.790 --> 02:44:07.440
SAM: Oh, that bastard.

4035
02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:09.115
MATT: Which...

4036
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:11.595
MARISHA: Shield?

4037
02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:14.423
MATT: Let me see.

4038
02:44:14.423 --> 02:44:15.630
You know this, what's the bonus, a plus five to AC?

4039
02:44:15.630 --> 02:44:16.463
LIAM: Five, it's five.

4040
02:44:16.463 --> 02:44:18.422
MATT: So yeah, misses.

4041
02:44:19.411 --> 02:44:20.770
ASHLEY: How long does it last?

4042
02:44:20.770 --> 02:44:21.890
SAM: Just one round.

4043
02:44:21.890 --> 02:44:23.598
MATT: It lasts for a full round.

4044
02:44:23.598 --> 02:44:25.330
LIAM: Can I Counterspell that?
SAM: What?

4045
02:44:25.330 --> 02:44:26.300
You're going to Counterspell that?

4046
02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:29.760
LIAM: I don't know. Can a reaction counter a reaction?

4047
02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:31.070
MATT: I imagine it probably can, yeah.

4048
02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:32.130
LIAM: Okay, Counterspell.

4049
02:44:32.130 --> 02:44:33.300
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll.

4050
02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:35.960
Oh, no, Shield's level one, it happens.

4051
02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:37.280
All right, there you go, spell's counterspelled.

4052
02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:38.190
Go ahead and roll your damage.

4053
02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:39.255
SAM: Oh.

4054
02:44:39.255 --> 02:44:40.268
MARISHA: Come on, kill him.

4055
02:44:40.268 --> 02:44:41.554
TRAVIS: Fucking Caleb, yes, yes, yes.

4056
02:44:41.554 --> 02:44:43.397
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

4057
02:44:43.397 --> 02:44:45.420
SAM: Oh yeah.
LAURA: Ooh, this is good.

4058
02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:46.920
TALIESIN: Oh lord.

4059
02:44:51.119 --> 02:44:52.960
SAM: 20, 23.

4060
02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:55.350
29.

4061
02:44:55.350 --> 02:44:56.183
MATT: 29.

4062
02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:03.155
Okay, he is looking real bad.

4063
02:45:03.155 --> 02:45:05.421
Like holy shit.

4064
02:45:05.421 --> 02:45:06.254
SAM: Damn it!

4065
02:45:06.254 --> 02:45:08.560
LIAM: It's got to be like single digits.

4066
02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:09.660
MATT: Okay, does that finish your turn?

4067
02:45:09.660 --> 02:45:11.130
SAM: Yeah, I'll duck back into my hidey hole.

4068
02:45:11.130 --> 02:45:12.980
TRAVIS: It's his turn.

4069
02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:15.380
MATT: It is his turn.

4070
02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:16.588
ASHLEY: Shit.

4071
02:45:16.588 --> 02:45:18.350
LAURA: Balls, shit, shit, shit.

4072
02:45:20.589 --> 02:45:22.814
Hashtag fuck!

4073
02:45:27.056 --> 02:45:28.008
SAM: Who's it going to go to?

4074
02:45:28.008 --> 02:45:29.260
MATT: Oh yeah, okay.

4075
02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:31.220
SAM: Oh no, he's got some sort of Fireball.

4076
02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:34.100
LAURA: He's got some sort of (poof!) and we're all dead.

4077
02:45:34.100 --> 02:45:38.960
MATT: He is going to fly as far as he can that direction.

4078
02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:40.700
You get an attack of opportunity against him.

4079
02:45:40.700 --> 02:45:41.533
SAM: Come on, Fjord.

4080
02:45:41.533 --> 02:45:42.420
MARISHA: Do I get one?

4081
02:45:42.420 --> 02:45:44.310
MATT: You've already used your reaction this turn.

4082
02:45:44.310 --> 02:45:46.970
LAURA: No.
SAM: Come on, Fjordy.

4083
02:45:46.970 --> 02:45:48.330
TRAVIS: 23.
TRAVIS: 23.

4084
02:45:48.330 --> 02:45:49.830
Shield, he's got his reaction back on this turn.

4085
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:51.740
TALIESIN: It got dispelled.
LIAM: It got dispelled by me.

4086
02:45:51.740 --> 02:45:53.210
MATT: No, he's casting Shield again

4087
02:45:53.210 --> 02:45:54.810
because he got his reaction back.

4088
02:45:54.810 --> 02:45:55.930
LIAM: Oh, he got his, oh.

4089
02:45:55.930 --> 02:45:57.316
TRAVIS: 26.
MATT: That hits.

4090
02:45:57.316 --> 02:45:59.070
ALL: Oh.

4091
02:46:00.020 --> 02:46:00.995
TRAVIS: Your Bless, sir.

4092
02:46:00.995 --> 02:46:02.238
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

4093
02:46:02.238 --> 02:46:04.140
MARISHA: Come on.

4094
02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:06.365
TRAVIS: Eight points of slashing damage.

4095
02:46:06.365 --> 02:46:07.748
MATT: Oh my fucking god!

4096
02:46:07.748 --> 02:46:09.964
LIAM: No, he's not dead yet?
MATT: No, one hit point!

4097
02:46:09.964 --> 02:46:11.660
He's got one hit point.

4098
02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:13.910
(laughter)

4099
02:46:15.370 --> 02:46:16.730
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry.

4100
02:46:16.730 --> 02:46:18.700
Hexblade's Curse plus four to damage.

4101
02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:21.341
ALL Oh!

4102
02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:23.900
MATT: That'll do it.

4103
02:46:27.530 --> 02:46:29.140
TRAVIS: Sometimes I got to remember it.

4104
02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:29.973
MATT: All right.

4105
02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:35.030
So go ahead and, I guess, how do you want to do this?

4106
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:38.690
TRAVIS: As he starts to fly off, I'll just take the falchion

4107
02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:41.010
and carve up his back right between the wings.

4108
02:46:41.010 --> 02:46:43.018
MATT: All right.

4109
02:46:43.018 --> 02:46:48.018
As he arcs through the air floating down,

4110
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:51.945
glances over towards Yasha as he's falling and says,

4111
02:46:51.945 --> 02:46:53.820
"Avenge me."

4112
02:46:53.820 --> 02:46:55.040
ASHLEY: Never.

4113
02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:58.320
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw with disadvantage.

4114
02:46:58.320 --> 02:46:59.153
LAURA: What?

4115
02:46:59.153 --> 02:47:00.280
TRAVIS: With disadvantage.

4116
02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:03.195
SAM: What is happening right now?

4117
02:47:03.195 --> 02:47:06.484
LAURA: Oh no, oh no.

4118
02:47:06.484 --> 02:47:08.434
(high-pitched) Oh no!

4119
02:47:09.848 --> 02:47:12.147
TALIESIN: Oh, nope, nope.

4120
02:47:12.147 --> 02:47:12.980
SAM: What was it?

4121
02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:14.550
ASHLEY: Two.

4122
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:16.000
TRAVIS: Two, flat two?

4123
02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.270
MATT: You feel a burning sharp pain in the back of your neck

4124
02:47:19.270 --> 02:47:21.770
right at the base of the skull.

4125
02:47:24.690 --> 02:47:29.672
And this old, forgotten anger wells up within you.

4126
02:47:33.913 --> 02:47:35.890
SAM: Oh god.

4127
02:47:35.890 --> 02:47:38.620
MATT: All right, he is--
SAM: What, what happens?

4128
02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:41.130
MATT: As you see him hit the ground and roll,

4129
02:47:41.130 --> 02:47:45.670
the body turns to mush.

4130
02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:49.730
Like fiends do.

4131
02:47:49.730 --> 02:47:51.560
SAM: We can't ask him questions, though.

4132
02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:53.950
MATT: You've killed fiends in previous campaigns.

4133
02:47:53.950 --> 02:47:55.360
SAM: Yeah, but not in this campaign.

4134
02:47:55.360 --> 02:47:56.193
We're surprised.

4135
02:47:59.381 --> 02:48:01.140
LIAM: So what's your personality?

4136
02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:03.710
SAM: How are we going to find out Yasha's backstory?

4137
02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:05.370
TALIESIN: We have to get the fuck out of here.

4138
02:48:05.370 --> 02:48:06.930
MATT: So that finishes Obann's go.

4139
02:48:06.930 --> 02:48:08.090
It's now the Laughing Hand's turn.

4140
02:48:08.090 --> 02:48:10.010
TRAVIS: Oh god, oh god, oh god.

4141
02:48:10.010 --> 02:48:13.060
MATT: The Laughing Hand has no movement at the moment.

4142
02:48:13.060 --> 02:48:15.420
So he's going to go ahead and make a slam attack

4143
02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:19.390
against the barlgura.

4144
02:48:20.894 --> 02:48:23.377
That's a natural 20.

4145
02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:30.860
Barlgura takes 20 points of bludgeoning damage.

4146
02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:32.753
You cannot see.

4147
02:48:32.753 --> 02:48:35.440
TRAVIS: The barlgura is toast.

4148
02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:36.680
MARISHA: Fuck.

4149
02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:38.307
MATT: Disintegrated.

4150
02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:41.010
MARISHA: He soaked some damage, though.

4151
02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:41.990
MATT: No longer grappled.

4152
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:43.023
He did.

4153
02:48:43.023 --> 02:48:44.481
MARISHA: That was awesome.

4154
02:48:44.481 --> 02:48:47.405
MATT: Getting up, half his movement.

4155
02:48:51.042 --> 02:48:52.180
LAURA: (gasps)

4156
02:48:53.318 --> 02:48:54.151
TRAVIS: Shit.

4157
02:48:54.151 --> 02:48:56.222
(laughs)

4158
02:48:56.222 --> 02:48:57.792
Fuck.

4159
02:48:57.792 --> 02:48:59.591
MATT: He leaps.

4160
02:48:59.591 --> 02:49:00.725
LAURA: What have we done?

4161
02:49:00.725 --> 02:49:03.020
MATT: On the upper part there.

4162
02:49:03.020 --> 02:49:05.210
The laughter now just louder and louder

4163
02:49:05.210 --> 02:49:08.090
as it surrounds each and every one of you.

4164
02:49:08.090 --> 02:49:10.812
He's going to take his two extra attacks.

4165
02:49:10.812 --> 02:49:12.320
TRAVIS: Oh no.

4166
02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:13.720
MATT: One's going to be at Beau and one's going to be at you

4167
02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:14.700
because he has a reach of ten.

4168
02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:17.870
So one at Beau, one at Fjord.

4169
02:49:17.870 --> 02:49:18.710
Let's see here.

4170
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:20.750
TRAVIS: What am I doing, what am I doing, what am I doing?

4171
02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:24.060
MATT: For Beau, that's going to be a 28 to hit.

4172
02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:25.550
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

4173
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:26.840
SAM: No big deal, guys.

4174
02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:29.500
What's it going to be, eight points of damage or something?

4175
02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:30.970
TRAVIS: We got to get the fuck out of here, all right?

4176
02:49:30.970 --> 02:49:32.150
TALIESIN: Yeah, real bad.

4177
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:34.710
SAM: We didn't learn anything about Yasha.

4178
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:35.950
LAURA: And Yasha's--

4179
02:49:35.950 --> 02:49:38.795
MATT: 21 points of slashing damage.

4180
02:49:40.173 --> 02:49:44.730
And against you, Fjord, that is going to be 17 to hit.

4181
02:49:44.730 --> 02:49:45.700
TRAVIS: That is my AC.

4182
02:49:45.700 --> 02:49:47.533
MATT: Okay, that hits.

4183
02:49:48.470 --> 02:49:53.250
You take 16 points of slashing damage.

4184
02:49:53.250 --> 02:49:55.000
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: All right.

4185
02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.180
MARISHA: You make the call.

4186
02:49:57.180 --> 02:50:00.440
MATT: That brings us to Fjord's turn.

4187
02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:02.010
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

4188
02:50:02.010 --> 02:50:03.780
I forgot because of the Ring of Protection

4189
02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:06.330
I have a plus one, so it was a three instead of a two.

4190
02:50:06.330 --> 02:50:07.700
MATT: Oh shit!

4191
02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:09.370
ASHLEY: I don't know if that changes things.

4192
02:50:09.370 --> 02:50:12.030
MATT: I'm going to say probably not.

4193
02:50:12.030 --> 02:50:14.790
TRAVIS: We're wanting to get the fuck outta here, right?

4194
02:50:15.809 --> 02:50:16.642
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4195
02:50:16.642 --> 02:50:18.750
TRAVIS: And Yasha's all down by herself, right?

4196
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:19.661
LAURA: Yeah.

4197
02:50:19.661 --> 02:50:24.655
TRAVIS: All right, I will, uh, fuck!

4198
02:50:24.655 --> 02:50:29.655
I will use ten feet of my movement to come around

4199
02:50:29.930 --> 02:50:31.450
to almost where Jester is.

4200
02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:32.470
And as right as I get to her

4201
02:50:32.470 --> 02:50:34.060
I will bonus action Misty Step--

4202
02:50:34.060 --> 02:50:36.323
MATT: First, as you're heading out of the range of the

4203
02:50:36.323 --> 02:50:38.148
blade, the Laughing Hand gets an attack of opportunity

4204
02:50:38.148 --> 02:50:38.981
against you.

4205
02:50:38.981 --> 02:50:41.960
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll just use my Misty Step to start with.

4206
02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:45.630
I'll just Misty Step straight down to where Yasha is.

4207
02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:46.463
MATT: Okay.

4208
02:50:47.636 --> 02:50:48.830
I'm letting you finagle that.

4209
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:51.630
TRAVIS: Unless you, I can take it, I did say that.

4210
02:50:51.630 --> 02:50:52.710
I can take it.

4211
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:54.590
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fair.

4212
02:50:54.590 --> 02:50:57.223
I know better.

4213
02:50:57.223 --> 02:50:59.190
MATT: That is a 25 to hit.

4214
02:50:59.190 --> 02:51:00.590
TRAVIS: That definitely hits.

4215
02:51:00.590 --> 02:51:02.160
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ.

4216
02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:04.570
MATT: You take 21 points of slashing damage.

4217
02:51:04.570 --> 02:51:05.403
TRAVIS: Oof.

4218
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:08.510
God, yeah, okay.

4219
02:51:08.510 --> 02:51:11.070
I will use my bonus action to Misty Step.

4220
02:51:11.070 --> 02:51:12.570
MATT: Actually, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw

4221
02:51:12.570 --> 02:51:13.630
for me, please.

4222
02:51:13.630 --> 02:51:16.118
TRAVIS: Oh, that's new.

4223
02:51:17.860 --> 02:51:18.693
19?

4224
02:51:18.693 --> 02:51:19.526
MATT: 19.

4225
02:51:19.526 --> 02:51:20.720
The laughter does not penetrate

4226
02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:23.390
your sure-fired warlock emblazoned mind.

4227
02:51:23.390 --> 02:51:24.800
You continue your turn as planned.

4228
02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:28.000
TRAVIS: I will bonus action Misty Step down to Yasha.

4229
02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.040
Right in front of her.

4230
02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:31.740
And I will grab both of her shoulders and be like:

4231
02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:33.850
You ready to get the fuck outta here?

4232
02:51:33.850 --> 02:51:36.660
MATT: She's just looking straight at you

4233
02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:38.130
and she begins to grin.

4234
02:51:38.130 --> 02:51:39.283
SAM: Oh boy.

4235
02:51:39.283 --> 02:51:40.757
MARISHA: Oh!

4236
02:51:40.757 --> 02:51:41.590
SAM: Oh boy.

4237
02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:42.800
TRAVIS: I'm going to take that as a yes.

4238
02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:47.800
I will cast Thunder Step and try and take Yasha with me.

4239
02:51:48.120 --> 02:51:49.600
A willing creature goes--

4240
02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:51.910
MATT: The creature is not willing.

4241
02:51:51.910 --> 02:51:55.692
TRAVIS: A non-willing creature...

4242
02:51:55.692 --> 02:52:00.020
♪ This is getting interesting, interesting ♪

4243
02:52:00.020 --> 02:52:01.190
Jesus.

4244
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:02.548
Where is it?

4245
02:52:04.130 --> 02:52:05.942
Five feet with you.

4246
02:52:10.600 --> 02:52:11.570
Unwilling creature.

4247
02:52:11.570 --> 02:52:13.945
Oh, they have to be willing.

4248
02:52:13.945 --> 02:52:15.480
ASHLEY: Fuck.

4249
02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:17.520
TRAVIS: Otherwise the creature is left behind.

4250
02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:18.353
MATT: Yep.

4251
02:52:18.353 --> 02:52:20.057
So where are you going?

4252
02:52:20.057 --> 02:52:21.580
MARISHA: Oh, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Out.

4253
02:52:22.580 --> 02:52:25.820
MARISHA: It was so honorables.

4254
02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:27.020
MATT: It was.

4255
02:52:27.020 --> 02:52:28.870
You appear in the hallway, arms out in front of you,

4256
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:30.770
and Yasha isn't with you.

4257
02:52:30.770 --> 02:52:34.630
TRAVIS: And they will take 5d10 thunder damage.

4258
02:52:34.630 --> 02:52:35.880
Go ahead and roll the damage.

4259
02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:38.080
That's to both of the--

4260
02:52:38.080 --> 02:52:40.470
TRAVIS: All three of them.
MATT: All three of them, yeah.

4261
02:52:40.470 --> 02:52:41.560
MARISHA: Including Yasha?

4262
02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:43.860
MATT: Including Yasha.

4263
02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:44.970
SAM: Ski-doosh.

4264
02:52:44.970 --> 02:52:46.636
MATT: What's the save on that? Dexterity?

4265
02:52:46.636 --> 02:52:50.980
TRAVIS: Yeah, there is a save. It is a constitution of 18.

4266
02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:53.647
ASHLEY: Constitution saving throw?
MATT: Yes.

4267
02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:57.860
Ooh, one of them succeeds, one of them fails.

4268
02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:01.040
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4269
02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:03.306
TRAVIS: 29.

4270
02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:05.210
Wow.

4271
02:53:05.210 --> 02:53:09.216
38, 39, 40, 41 points of thunder damage.

4272
02:53:11.539 --> 02:53:14.130
MATT: That shadow hound is disintegrated from the blast

4273
02:53:14.130 --> 02:53:14.963
of thunder energy.

4274
02:53:14.963 --> 02:53:16.630
The other one (whimpers) takes the damage.

4275
02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:18.130
And you see its body flickering

4276
02:53:18.130 --> 02:53:20.663
and it's looking pretty hurt.

4277
02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:26.100
TRAVIS: And you took all of it because it's thunder.

4278
02:53:26.100 --> 02:53:27.580
ASHLEY: I rolled a 20 for constitution.

4279
02:53:27.580 --> 02:53:29.060
MATT: So you take half damage.

4280
02:53:29.060 --> 02:53:30.180
ASHLEY: Okay, what was the total?

4281
02:53:30.180 --> 02:53:31.990
TRAVIS: 41, right?

4282
02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:34.330
MATT: Yes, you take 20 points of thunder damage.

4283
02:53:34.330 --> 02:53:35.163
ASHLEY: Okay.

4284
02:53:36.030 --> 02:53:37.680
SAM: ♪ Thun-dah. ♪

4285
02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:39.507
TALIESIN: Holy shit.

4286
02:53:42.594 --> 02:53:45.046
TRAVIS: I don't know what happened.

4287
02:53:45.046 --> 02:53:48.068
SAM: She wasn't willing.

4288
02:53:48.068 --> 02:53:52.400
TRAVIS: I'll use the-- I have like 20 more feet of movement

4289
02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:54.970
and I'll just back up the hallway

4290
02:53:54.970 --> 02:53:56.600
trying to figure out what just happened.

4291
02:53:56.600 --> 02:53:59.690
MATT: Okay. Pulling back, pulling back, pulling back.

4292
02:53:59.690 --> 02:54:03.540
That brings us to Yasha's turn.

4293
02:54:05.590 --> 02:54:09.650
You see a tiny goblin hiding right around the edge

4294
02:54:09.650 --> 02:54:12.730
who did not hide at the end of their turn last turn.

4295
02:54:12.730 --> 02:54:17.420
Avenging the old friend, as their body dissipates,

4296
02:54:17.420 --> 02:54:21.647
you rush over the stairs, blade held high.

4297
02:54:21.647 --> 02:54:22.782
SAM: Hi.

4298
02:54:22.782 --> 02:54:24.400
MATT: Go ahead and make two attacks against Nott.

4299
02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:25.878
TRAVIS: What is happening?

4300
02:54:25.878 --> 02:54:27.100
What the fuck is happening?

4301
02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:28.540
MATT: Don't forget you have Bless, too.

4302
02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:29.940
So roll your d4s per attack.

4303
02:54:32.030 --> 02:54:34.900
TRAVIS: But what if he doesn't want to Bless her anymore?

4304
02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:35.950
ASHLEY: Thank god.

4305
02:54:35.950 --> 02:54:36.783
Okay.

4306
02:54:38.650 --> 02:54:39.690
Um, um, um.

4307
02:54:39.690 --> 02:54:42.620
TALIESIN: Bless would have been dropped, actually, shit.

4308
02:54:42.620 --> 02:54:43.728
ASHLEY and LAURA: Bless would've been dropped?

4309
02:54:43.728 --> 02:54:45.080
TALIESIN: Bless would have been dropped.

4310
02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:45.913
SAM: When?

4311
02:54:45.913 --> 02:54:46.746
MATT: Oh, because you did the Holy Weapon.

4312
02:54:46.746 --> 02:54:47.960
TALIESIN: Yeah, sorry.

4313
02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:50.220
ASHLEY: Wait, so I roll twice for two attacks?

4314
02:54:50.220 --> 02:54:51.510
MATT: No Bless there.

4315
02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:53.680
There's no Bless, hm, I think there

4316
02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:54.770
may have been some fiddliness there.

4317
02:54:54.770 --> 02:54:55.950
TALIESIN: Yeah, sorry, sorry.

4318
02:54:55.950 --> 02:54:56.783
MATT: That's okay.

4319
02:54:56.783 --> 02:54:58.650
I'll go ahead and I'll mark some things.

4320
02:54:58.650 --> 02:54:59.960
TALIESIN: Brain's a little melty.

4321
02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:01.910
ASHLEY: I rolled a three, or no, I'm sorry, hold on.

4322
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:03.593
TALIESIN: Beau's still.

4323
02:55:04.750 --> 02:55:05.650
MARISHA: Still Holy Weapon.

4324
02:55:05.650 --> 02:55:07.261
MATT: Right, Holy Weapon, but there's no actual Bless.

4325
02:55:07.261 --> 02:55:08.363
TALIESIN: Shit.

4326
02:55:08.363 --> 02:55:10.000
Yeah.

4327
02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:11.917
ASHLEY: I rolled a ten and an 11.

4328
02:55:13.010 --> 02:55:13.843
SAM: What?

4329
02:55:13.843 --> 02:55:14.676
LAURA: As attacks.

4330
02:55:14.676 --> 02:55:15.670
SAM: Total?

4331
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:16.544
ASHLEY: Totals, I rolled a two and a three.

4332
02:55:16.544 --> 02:55:17.780
TALIESIN: Oh my god, you did.

4333
02:55:19.385 --> 02:55:20.218
MATT: That was for the first attack,

4334
02:55:20.218 --> 02:55:21.426
for the Reckless Attack,

4335
02:55:21.426 --> 02:55:22.960
or was that just for both attacks?

4336
02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:24.960
ASHLEY: That was just the first attack, yeah.

4337
02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:25.793
So second attack.

4338
02:55:25.793 --> 02:55:27.640
TRAVIS: Did she make them Reckless?

4339
02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:30.532
MATT: She's making them Reckless.

4340
02:55:30.532 --> 02:55:33.058
ASHLEY: Oh, that hits for sure.

4341
02:55:33.058 --> 02:55:34.250
It's 21.

4342
02:55:34.250 --> 02:55:35.600
MATT: Did you roll Reckless

4343
02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:36.641
with advantage on the second attack?

4344
02:55:36.641 --> 02:55:39.630
LAURA: It could've been a 20 as the...

4345
02:55:39.630 --> 02:55:40.463
ASHLEY: No.

4346
02:55:40.463 --> 02:55:43.967
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll the full damage.

4347
02:55:47.816 --> 02:55:49.707
ASHLEY: Five, ten, I'm going to do Savage Attack

4348
02:55:49.707 --> 02:55:51.957
because that was low.

4349
02:55:53.010 --> 02:55:54.800
No, that was better.

4350
02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:56.220
Okay, ten total.

4351
02:55:56.220 --> 02:55:58.660
MATT: Ten points of slashing damage to you, Nott.

4352
02:55:58.660 --> 02:55:59.750
SAM: Uncanny Dodge?

4353
02:55:59.750 --> 02:56:02.570
MATT: All right, you so you take half the damage to five.

4354
02:56:02.570 --> 02:56:03.945
SAM: Okay.

4355
02:56:05.180 --> 02:56:08.330
Yasha's really not that powerful.

4356
02:56:08.330 --> 02:56:10.840
TRAVIS: Would you shut your damn mouth?

4357
02:56:12.023 --> 02:56:13.740
MATT: That finishes Yasha's turn.

4358
02:56:13.740 --> 02:56:16.850
Brings us to Beau and Caleb.

4359
02:56:16.850 --> 02:56:19.923
Beau, could you make a wisdom saving throw for me, please?

4360
02:56:19.923 --> 02:56:21.730
MARISHA: Oh boy, yeah.

4361
02:56:25.532 --> 02:56:28.500
Okay.

4362
02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:29.410
14?

4363
02:56:29.410 --> 02:56:30.600
MATT: 14.

4364
02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:33.060
Unfortunately, due to the series of wounds he's taken,

4365
02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:36.000
the laughter is so loud that it fills your mind

4366
02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.120
with absolute fear.

4367
02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:41.250
You are frightened and your speed is zero.

4368
02:56:41.250 --> 02:56:44.000
SAM: Oh boy, this is getting bad.

4369
02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:46.440
MARISHA: Is it the top of my turn?

4370
02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:47.273
MATT: Yes.

4371
02:56:47.273 --> 02:56:48.950
MARISHA: Do I still have a turn?
MATT: You do.

4372
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:51.870
MARISHA: I will use Stillness of Mind

4373
02:56:51.870 --> 02:56:55.350
and take my action to end my frightened.

4374
02:56:55.350 --> 02:56:56.910
MATT: Okay, so you're no longer frightened.

4375
02:56:56.910 --> 02:56:58.900
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus, okay.

4376
02:56:58.900 --> 02:57:00.680
SAM: Can she still move or?

4377
02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:01.780
MATT: Yeah, she's no longer frightened.

4378
02:57:01.780 --> 02:57:03.787
SAM: Oh! Oh!

4379
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:05.503
Oh.

4380
02:57:05.503 --> 02:57:08.480
TALIESIN: You still have a bonus action.
MARISHA: Monk shit.

4381
02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:09.950
TRAVIS: We got to get the fuck outta here.

4382
02:57:09.950 --> 02:57:11.550
MATT: What are you doing with the rest of your turn?

4383
02:57:12.910 --> 02:57:15.910
MARISHA: I've got to get out of here.

4384
02:57:15.910 --> 02:57:18.570
I'm assuming Fjord is saying, "We got to get out of here"?

4385
02:57:18.570 --> 02:57:21.000
TALIESIN: We are all saying we got to get out of here.

4386
02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:24.490
MARISHA: Do I get my movement back?

4387
02:57:24.490 --> 02:57:25.740
MATT: Yeah, you have your movement back

4388
02:57:25.740 --> 02:57:26.950
because you saved from the frightened.

4389
02:57:26.950 --> 02:57:28.370
MARISHA: So I have a bonus action and a move.

4390
02:57:28.370 --> 02:57:29.580
MATT: Correct.

4391
02:57:29.580 --> 02:57:32.100
MARISHA: I will bonus action Flurry of Blows--

4392
02:57:32.100 --> 02:57:33.860
MATT: You cannot, because you have to use the attack action

4393
02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:35.360
to go into a Flurry of Blows.

4394
02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:36.330
MARISHA: Okay.

4395
02:57:36.330 --> 02:57:37.960
You are 100% correct.

4396
02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:40.030
So I have no more attacks.
MATT: Correct.

4397
02:57:40.030 --> 02:57:43.677
MARISHA: I will (laughs).

4398
02:57:45.020 --> 02:57:45.853
I will...

4399
02:57:51.178 --> 02:57:55.500
use, spend a ki point to use Step of the Wind

4400
02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:57.160
and disengage.

4401
02:57:57.160 --> 02:57:57.993
MATT: All righty.

4402
02:57:58.950 --> 02:57:59.783
So you disengage.

4403
02:57:59.783 --> 02:58:00.616
And where are you going?

4404
02:58:00.616 --> 02:58:01.449
MARISHA: I'm going to go towards Fjord.

4405
02:58:01.449 --> 02:58:02.770
MATT: All right.

4406
02:58:02.770 --> 02:58:06.532
You run quite a distance following Fjord.

4407
02:58:13.090 --> 02:58:14.220
That finishes your turn.

4408
02:58:14.220 --> 02:58:17.390
LAURA: Are we going to have to go back over the bridge?

4409
02:58:17.390 --> 02:58:18.223
MATT: Caleb.

4410
02:58:19.290 --> 02:58:22.280
LIAM: Cat's Ire should be gone because I used Polymorph,

4411
02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:23.880
and it was up.

4412
02:58:25.156 --> 02:58:26.540
MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

4413
02:58:26.540 --> 02:58:27.373
LIAM: Okay.

4414
02:58:27.373 --> 02:58:31.200
ASHLEY: Is that the door on the other side?

4415
02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:34.130
LIAM: 24.

4416
02:58:34.130 --> 02:58:36.038
MATT: Okay, there you go.

4417
02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:42.620
LIAM: Jeez, Nott's there, Jester's there.

4418
02:58:42.620 --> 02:58:45.090
I am going to cast Polymorph on myself.

4419
02:58:45.090 --> 02:58:45.930
MATT: Okay.

4420
02:58:45.930 --> 02:58:50.080
LIAM: And I am going to turn into a giant ape.

4421
02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:50.913
MATT: Okay.

4422
02:58:50.913 --> 02:58:52.730
LIAM: A giant ape.

4423
02:58:52.730 --> 02:58:55.770
MATT: We'll use this guy because I think it's close enough.

4424
02:58:55.770 --> 02:58:57.170
SAM: He's back.

4425
02:58:57.170 --> 02:58:58.398
TRAVIS: George.

4426
02:58:58.398 --> 02:59:01.148
MARISHA: (laughs)

4427
02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:07.946
LIAM: And I am going to

4428
02:59:07.946 --> 02:59:10.871
circle around Caduceus.

4429
02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:18.400
And get, yeah, and get in the laughing guy's face

4430
02:59:19.050 --> 02:59:21.410
and yell towards Jester and Nott

4431
02:59:21.410 --> 02:59:24.418
and Yasha and just go (roars).

4432
02:59:25.389 --> 02:59:28.180
And then I will punch him in the face two times.

4433
02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:29.470
MATT: Well, you just used your action to Polymorph.

4434
02:59:29.470 --> 02:59:31.283
LIAM: Action to Polymorph? Oh, great.

4435
02:59:31.283 --> 02:59:32.300
Then I just yell in his face.

4436
02:59:32.300 --> 02:59:34.625
MATT: You got it. All right, that finishes your turn.

4437
02:59:34.625 --> 02:59:35.540
That brings us to Caduceus.

4438
02:59:35.540 --> 02:59:36.820
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

4439
02:59:36.820 --> 02:59:37.653
TALIESIN: Okay.

4440
02:59:38.503 --> 02:59:41.508
This one's been kind of okay today.

4441
02:59:42.800 --> 02:59:44.475
Wow, that really went.

4442
02:59:45.370 --> 02:59:48.000
Oh my god.
LAURA: Oh no!

4443
02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:49.391
MATT: As the fear takes hold,

4444
02:59:49.391 --> 02:59:52.080
the laughter piercing your mind,

4445
02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:54.840
you find yourself racked with fear and unable to move.

4446
02:59:54.840 --> 02:59:56.545
TRAVIS: Fuck me.

4447
02:59:56.545 --> 02:59:57.510
(screams)

4448
02:59:57.510 --> 02:59:59.850
TALIESIN: I'm racked with fear and unable to move.

4449
02:59:59.850 --> 03:00:00.683
MATT: Correct.

4450
03:00:00.683 --> 03:00:02.213
TALIESIN: So I have fear.

4451
03:00:02.213 --> 03:00:03.179
MATT: You are frightened.

4452
03:00:03.179 --> 03:00:06.180
TALIESIN: So what cures frightened?

4453
03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:08.658
TRAVIS: Chocolate, according to Harry Potter.

4454
03:00:08.658 --> 03:00:10.560
(laughter)

4455
03:00:10.560 --> 03:00:13.460
TALIESIN: What deals with fear?

4456
03:00:18.410 --> 03:00:19.993
TRAVIS: Master debating?

4457
03:00:19.993 --> 03:00:23.935
(laughter)

4458
03:00:28.682 --> 03:00:30.141
MARISHA: Caduceus?

4459
03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:32.156
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

4460
03:00:32.156 --> 03:00:33.810
SAM: Caduceus, what are you doing in here?

4461
03:00:34.780 --> 03:00:35.800
TALIESIN: Does anything cure fear

4462
03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:37.570
or am I just kind of fucked on this?

4463
03:00:37.570 --> 03:00:41.110
MATT: It depends on what type of spells you have prepared.

4464
03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:43.850
TALIESIN: Does Lesser Restoration cure fear?

4465
03:00:43.850 --> 03:00:45.320
MATT: Go and check it out.

4466
03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:48.650
I'll pull it up here as well.

4467
03:00:48.650 --> 03:00:50.520
TALIESIN: Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

4468
03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:51.990
So not fear.
MATT: So no.

4469
03:00:51.990 --> 03:00:53.310
TALIESIN: Fuck, okay.

4470
03:00:53.310 --> 03:00:54.880
MATT: Greater Restoration however--

4471
03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:57.600
TALIESIN: It's a 5th-level, but I don't have a 5th level.

4472
03:00:57.600 --> 03:00:59.732
Okay, that's fine.

4473
03:01:01.410 --> 03:01:03.990
I am going to...

4474
03:01:07.770 --> 03:01:12.770
Motherfucker, I am going to cast...

4475
03:01:17.545 --> 03:01:18.511
Bless.

4476
03:01:18.511 --> 03:01:19.660
Oh fuck, what am I doing?

4477
03:01:19.660 --> 03:01:20.493
Yeah, all right.

4478
03:01:20.493 --> 03:01:25.493
I'm casting Bless on Jester.

4479
03:01:25.867 --> 03:01:29.975
I'm dropping yours, sorry.

4480
03:01:30.858 --> 03:01:32.460
I don't have any, okay.

4481
03:01:32.460 --> 03:01:33.650
MATT: Bless on Jester, you said?

4482
03:01:33.650 --> 03:01:34.540
TALIESIN: Bless on Jester.

4483
03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:36.120
Bless on Caleb.

4484
03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:38.620
Bless on myself.

4485
03:01:38.620 --> 03:01:40.040
MATT: Yep, he's a Blessed gorilla.

4486
03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:43.020
TALIESIN: And do I see anybody else or?

4487
03:01:43.020 --> 03:01:44.060
MATT: That's three.

4488
03:01:44.060 --> 03:01:45.540
TALIESIN: I'm casting it at 2nd-level.

4489
03:01:45.540 --> 03:01:46.790
MATT: 2nd-level.

4490
03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:48.580
Right now, you can see...

4491
03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:51.340
TALIESIN: I can't see anybody, can I?

4492
03:01:51.340 --> 03:01:52.760
MATT: You probably can't see Nott from this point.

4493
03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:53.593
SAM: You can see Yasha.

4494
03:01:53.593 --> 03:01:55.100
MATT: You can see Yasha and you can see Fjord

4495
03:01:55.100 --> 03:01:57.375
and you can see Beau.

4496
03:01:57.375 --> 03:01:58.880
What's the range on that?

4497
03:01:58.880 --> 03:01:59.713
TALIESIN: 30 feet.

4498
03:01:59.713 --> 03:02:00.546
MATT: 30 feet?

4499
03:02:00.546 --> 03:02:02.420
Yeah, you couldn't even reach any of 'em.

4500
03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:05.612
TALIESIN: All right. That's my frigging thing

4501
03:02:05.612 --> 03:02:07.330
other than just holding a reaction.

4502
03:02:07.330 --> 03:02:09.163
MATT: Okay, Jester, you're up.

4503
03:02:09.163 --> 03:02:10.620
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me, please.

4504
03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:13.410
LAURA: Oh, that far away, huh?

4505
03:02:13.410 --> 03:02:15.326
TRAVIS: What's the radius right now?

4506
03:02:15.326 --> 03:02:16.159
LAURA: I don't know, man.

4507
03:02:16.159 --> 03:02:18.320
TALIESIN: You have a d4.
MATT: It's a 15-foot radius.

4508
03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:20.330
SAM: Oh nos.

4509
03:02:20.330 --> 03:02:21.360
LAURA: What's the range?

4510
03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:24.003
TRAVIS: 15-foot around him.

4511
03:02:24.003 --> 03:02:27.720
I think it gets louder every time we fucking hit him.

4512
03:02:28.690 --> 03:02:29.990
LAURA: 16?

4513
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:32.920
MATT: 16, you manage to resist the fear.

4514
03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:34.303
SAM: That Bless.

4515
03:02:34.303 --> 03:02:36.630
LAURA: That Bless saved me.

4516
03:02:36.630 --> 03:02:38.510
Okay, okay, okay.

4517
03:02:38.510 --> 03:02:42.653
TALIESIN: Fuck, man. Not okay.
LAURA: Okay.

4518
03:02:42.653 --> 03:02:44.490
MARISHA: Get the fuck out.

4519
03:02:44.490 --> 03:02:46.823
TRAVIS: What about Yasha? What the fuck?

4520
03:02:46.823 --> 03:02:49.260
SAM: What about Caduceus?

4521
03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:52.860
LAURA: I saw Yasha hit Nott?

4522
03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:54.320
MATT: Make a perception check.

4523
03:02:54.320 --> 03:02:56.450
Actually, your passive perception,

4524
03:02:56.450 --> 03:02:57.890
yeah, you probably would've seen it.

4525
03:02:57.890 --> 03:02:59.593
15, yeah.
SAM: (yells)

4526
03:02:59.593 --> 03:03:01.612
MATT: Even though you're running up the stairs.

4527
03:03:01.612 --> 03:03:02.710
TRAVIS: Where are you, like in this corner?

4528
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:03.884
SAM: Yeah.

4529
03:03:03.884 --> 03:03:05.760
LAURA: Oh god.

4530
03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:08.920
Okay, I'm going to

4531
03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:12.290
turn to Yasha and say: We don't have time for you

4532
03:03:12.290 --> 03:03:15.710
to be controlled. And I'm going to cast Charm Person.

4533
03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:17.360
SAM: On Yasha?
LAURA: On Yasha.

4534
03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:19.550
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Oh boy.

4535
03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:20.741
Charm on charm.

4536
03:03:20.741 --> 03:03:22.023
MARISHA: Yeah.

4537
03:03:22.023 --> 03:03:25.170
Do two charms make a--

4538
03:03:25.170 --> 03:03:26.930
LAURA: Two wrongs make a right, I don't know.

4539
03:03:26.930 --> 03:03:29.644
MATT: Okay, so make a wisdom saving throw.

4540
03:03:29.644 --> 03:03:31.069
LAURA: At advantage because you're not

4541
03:03:31.069 --> 03:03:32.327
friendly to us right now.

4542
03:03:32.327 --> 03:03:34.784
MATT: Correct.

4543
03:03:34.784 --> 03:03:38.150
LAURA: Oh goddamn it.

4544
03:03:38.150 --> 03:03:39.540
She rolled so well.

4545
03:03:39.540 --> 03:03:41.350
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

4546
03:03:41.350 --> 03:03:42.183
ASHLEY: 19?

4547
03:03:42.183 --> 03:03:43.360
MATT: 19, yeah.

4548
03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:46.440
It does not find purchase within Yasha's head.

4549
03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:49.062
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

4550
03:03:50.570 --> 03:03:52.190
Why'd you have to roll so good?

4551
03:03:52.190 --> 03:03:53.706
No, you had to roll low on this one.

4552
03:03:53.706 --> 03:03:55.880
ASHLEY: Oh oh oh oh oh oh.

4553
03:03:55.880 --> 03:03:56.750
I understand.

4554
03:03:56.750 --> 03:03:59.400
TRAVIS: Does she roll a save every round, Yasha?

4555
03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:01.880
MATT: No.
LAURA: No, she's just straight up.

4556
03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:04.260
Okay.
ASHLEY: I see what just happened.

4557
03:04:04.260 --> 03:04:06.270
I got really excited for just a split second.

4558
03:04:06.270 --> 03:04:07.280
MATT: Sorry.

4559
03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:09.170
What you doing, Jester?

4560
03:04:09.170 --> 03:04:14.170
LAURA: I'm going to try to run outies.

4561
03:04:14.830 --> 03:04:15.860
SAM: For sure you are.

4562
03:04:15.860 --> 03:04:17.310
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to run.

4563
03:04:18.180 --> 03:04:20.642
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

4564
03:04:20.642 --> 03:04:22.267
LAURA: Before I do it, oh,

4565
03:04:22.267 --> 03:04:25.310
I'm going to bring my spiritual weapon

4566
03:04:25.310 --> 03:04:27.580
and try to kill that dog.

4567
03:04:27.580 --> 03:04:28.413
MATT: All right.

4568
03:04:28.413 --> 03:04:29.590
Go ahead and roll an attack.

4569
03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:32.400
MARISHA: Fuck that dog.

4570
03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:35.710
LAURA: It's just a, uh, 12.

4571
03:04:35.710 --> 03:04:36.910
MATT: 12 does not hit him, unfortunately.

4572
03:04:36.910 --> 03:04:39.435
LAURA: No, it fucking doesn't.

4573
03:04:39.435 --> 03:04:40.420
Bleh.

4574
03:04:40.420 --> 03:04:42.190
MATT: (pitying laugh)

4575
03:04:42.190 --> 03:04:43.750
Sorry, dice.

4576
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:45.030
All right, does that finish your turn?

4577
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:47.155
LAURA: I guess. I mean, that's everything I can do, man.

4578
03:04:47.155 --> 03:04:48.370
MATT: All right, Nott, you're up.

4579
03:04:48.370 --> 03:04:50.640
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm clear on our objective right now.

4580
03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:52.540
LAURA: I can't believe you rolled that good.

4581
03:04:52.540 --> 03:04:54.663
SAM: Caduceus can't move.

4582
03:04:54.663 --> 03:04:56.446
MATT: He's currently cowering in fear,

4583
03:04:56.446 --> 03:04:58.412
barely casting his spells.

4584
03:04:58.412 --> 03:05:01.880
LIAM: And Caleb is about to be stuck as well

4585
03:05:01.880 --> 03:05:04.487
because of his very low wisdom.

4586
03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:08.193
I will--

4587
03:05:08.193 --> 03:05:09.050
TRAVIS: I got to walk.

4588
03:05:09.050 --> 03:05:12.688
SAM: I will take a small flower out of my hair

4589
03:05:12.688 --> 03:05:17.688
and hand it to Yasha and run away as fast as I can.

4590
03:05:18.020 --> 03:05:20.822
Bonus action disengage.
MATT: Okay.

4591
03:05:22.270 --> 03:05:24.060
To get up here, I need you to make an athletics check

4592
03:05:24.060 --> 03:05:26.550
to climb, or acrobatics to try and parkour off this thing,

4593
03:05:26.550 --> 03:05:28.041
your choice.

4594
03:05:30.070 --> 03:05:31.840
SAM: Acrobatics, I guess.

4595
03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:33.700
11.
MATT: 11?

4596
03:05:33.700 --> 03:05:35.450
You get up there, I'll say,

4597
03:05:35.450 --> 03:05:37.130
but it takes ten feet of your movement.

4598
03:05:37.130 --> 03:05:39.410
So you have 25 feet still to move.

4599
03:05:39.410 --> 03:05:42.202
SAM: I will move those 25 feet.

4600
03:05:42.202 --> 03:05:43.490
MATT: 15, 20, 25.

4601
03:05:43.490 --> 03:05:44.480
That's where you get there.

4602
03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:45.710
That's your bonus and your movement.

4603
03:05:45.710 --> 03:05:46.543
You have an action still.

4604
03:05:46.543 --> 03:05:49.720
SAM: And then my action I will keep moving.

4605
03:05:49.720 --> 03:05:51.385
MATT: Okay.

4606
03:05:51.385 --> 03:05:52.218
Five, ten, 15, 20--

4607
03:05:52.218 --> 03:05:55.150
SAM: Trying to stay within 30 feet of Caleb.

4608
03:05:55.150 --> 03:05:56.700
MATT: Okay yeah, that keeps you at 30 feet from Caleb.

4609
03:05:56.700 --> 03:05:58.380
I'll put you there.

4610
03:05:58.380 --> 03:05:59.213
All right.

4611
03:05:59.213 --> 03:06:00.950
That finishes your turn?

4612
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:01.783
SAM: That's it.

4613
03:06:01.783 --> 03:06:02.616
MATT: All right.

4614
03:06:02.616 --> 03:06:06.240
It is now the Laughing Hand and the dogs' turn.

4615
03:06:06.240 --> 03:06:08.980
SAM: Laughing Hand and the Dogs is a great band name.

4616
03:06:08.980 --> 03:06:10.510
MARISHA: It totally is.

4617
03:06:10.510 --> 03:06:11.860
MATT: The dog is going to shift around

4618
03:06:11.860 --> 03:06:14.120
and both of them are going to swap places here.

4619
03:06:14.120 --> 03:06:15.020
LAURA: Oh, like a rook move.

4620
03:06:15.020 --> 03:06:19.250
MATT: The dog's going to jump up across the ceiling, leap.

4621
03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:21.510
LAURA: Those dogs are fucking cool and scary.

4622
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:22.343
MATT: Move in.

4623
03:06:22.343 --> 03:06:24.228
TALIESIN: Motherfucker, really?

4624
03:06:24.228 --> 03:06:25.928
LIAM: Was that dog within range of me?

4625
03:06:26.780 --> 03:06:27.613
MATT: That dog was not.

4626
03:06:27.613 --> 03:06:28.446
It was back here.

4627
03:06:28.446 --> 03:06:29.360
And then it leapt.

4628
03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:31.360
LIAM: Don't I have a ten-foot range?

4629
03:06:31.360 --> 03:06:32.440
MATT: You have a ten-foot reach there.

4630
03:06:32.440 --> 03:06:34.510
LIAM: Ten-foot reach as--
MATT: Then yeah, you would.

4631
03:06:34.510 --> 03:06:35.463
You get an attack of opportunity.

4632
03:06:35.463 --> 03:06:37.110
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

4633
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:38.510
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll punch that dog.

4634
03:06:38.510 --> 03:06:40.430
SAM: Ape punch.

4635
03:06:41.450 --> 03:06:42.850
LIAM: That's 15 to hit.

4636
03:06:42.850 --> 03:06:46.080
MATT: 15 to hit, 15 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

4637
03:06:46.080 --> 03:06:49.050
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

4638
03:06:49.050 --> 03:06:52.240
LIAM: Seven, 13, 19.

4639
03:06:52.240 --> 03:06:54.030
MATT: 19 damage, nice.

4640
03:06:54.030 --> 03:06:55.530
Wham, try and fist punch to it.

4641
03:06:55.530 --> 03:06:58.370
The creature rushes past, runs across the ceiling

4642
03:06:58.370 --> 03:07:00.360
and lands behind now blocking in.

4643
03:07:00.360 --> 03:07:04.668
It's going to be first attack,

4644
03:07:04.668 --> 03:07:07.351
giant blade on Caduceus.

4645
03:07:07.351 --> 03:07:10.420
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.
MATT: With advantage.

4646
03:07:10.420 --> 03:07:12.500
That's going to be a 24 to hit.

4647
03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:14.000
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

4648
03:07:14.940 --> 03:07:17.740
MATT: You suffer 18 points of slashing damage.

4649
03:07:17.740 --> 03:07:19.231
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

4650
03:07:19.231 --> 03:07:20.730
LAURA: Stop, don't do these--

4651
03:07:20.730 --> 03:07:23.380
MATT: The dog from behind is going to attack you.

4652
03:07:23.380 --> 03:07:24.213
TALIESIN: Okay.

4653
03:07:24.213 --> 03:07:25.990
MATT: I need you to roll a constitution saving throw

4654
03:07:25.990 --> 03:07:28.640
by the way for the Bless, if you don't mind.

4655
03:07:28.640 --> 03:07:30.340
TALIESIN: Sure.

4656
03:07:33.820 --> 03:07:35.010
Nine?

4657
03:07:35.010 --> 03:07:36.190
MATT: No, you lose the Bless.

4658
03:07:36.190 --> 03:07:37.023
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

4659
03:07:40.023 --> 03:07:41.831
LIAM: I'm just a regular giant ape now.

4660
03:07:41.831 --> 03:07:44.580
MATT: Yes, you are.

4661
03:07:44.580 --> 03:07:45.451
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

4662
03:07:45.451 --> 03:07:49.920
MATT: All right, so that's a 19 to hit for the hound.

4663
03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:50.780
TALIESIN: Really, a 19 to hit?

4664
03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:52.200
MATT: He has advantage because he has pack tactics

4665
03:07:52.200 --> 03:07:54.090
when attacking with an ally.

4666
03:07:54.090 --> 03:07:56.600
That is going to be 2d4, not 2d8.

4667
03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:58.983
TALIESIN: This might be the end of me.

4668
03:07:58.983 --> 03:08:00.040
MATT: Nine points of piercing damage.

4669
03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:01.860
TALIESIN: Yeah, this really might be the end of me.

4670
03:08:03.920 --> 03:08:05.390
MATT: So nine points piercing damage.

4671
03:08:06.250 --> 03:08:08.520
It's going to go ahead and slam you with its fist.

4672
03:08:09.690 --> 03:08:10.590
TALIESIN: Roll bad.

4673
03:08:10.590 --> 03:08:12.070
MATT: Nah, that's a natural 19.

4674
03:08:14.350 --> 03:08:16.250
30 to hit.

4675
03:08:18.130 --> 03:08:20.030
TALIESIN: Just barely.

4676
03:08:21.023 --> 03:08:22.350
SAM: I'll allow it.

4677
03:08:22.350 --> 03:08:26.992
MATT: You take ten points of bludgeoning damage.

4678
03:08:28.787 --> 03:08:30.928
TRAVIS: It's Jester, the gorilla, the hound,

4679
03:08:30.928 --> 03:08:31.761
the Laughing Hand,

4680
03:08:31.761 --> 03:08:33.710
and Caduceus in the middle, right?

4681
03:08:33.710 --> 03:08:34.970
MATT: Right.
TRAVIS: Am I missing something?

4682
03:08:34.970 --> 03:08:36.470
MATT: Yeah, they're right there.

4683
03:08:36.470 --> 03:08:38.350
TALIESIN: I am kind of fucked.

4684
03:08:38.350 --> 03:08:41.780
MATT: And third slice with its against you.

4685
03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:44.840
SAM: Natural 20?
MATT: Natural 20.

4686
03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:46.090
LIAM: No.
TALIESIN: I cancel it.

4687
03:08:46.090 --> 03:08:48.580
MATT: You do.
ALL: Oh.

4688
03:08:48.580 --> 03:08:52.448
MATT: And thank god.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

4689
03:08:52.448 --> 03:08:53.456
TALIESIN: Someone's going to need to carry me

4690
03:08:53.456 --> 03:08:55.089
the fuck out of here.

4691
03:08:55.089 --> 03:08:56.630
MATT: 22 points of slashing damage.

4692
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:59.040
TALIESIN: I am kind of standing.

4693
03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:00.010
SAM: He's okay.

4694
03:09:00.010 --> 03:09:00.843
MATT: All righty.

4695
03:09:00.843 --> 03:09:02.930
TALIESIN: I am bad.

4696
03:09:02.930 --> 03:09:04.660
SAM: Don't be worried.

4697
03:09:04.660 --> 03:09:08.330
TALIESIN: Yeah, oh yeah, low ones.

4698
03:09:08.330 --> 03:09:10.130
MATT: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

4699
03:09:10.130 --> 03:09:14.448
MATT: All righty. That finishes his turn.

4700
03:09:14.448 --> 03:09:15.970
Fjord, you're up.

4701
03:09:15.970 --> 03:09:17.970
TRAVIS: I am up?
MATT: Yep.

4702
03:09:19.420 --> 03:09:20.470
TRAVIS: I'm coming back in.

4703
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:22.720
MATT: Okay.

4704
03:09:22.720 --> 03:09:24.370
Full movement can get you about there.

4705
03:09:24.370 --> 03:09:25.830
You're in melee with the dog.

4706
03:09:25.830 --> 03:09:27.360
TRAVIS: I'm in melee with the dog?
MATT: Correct.

4707
03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:31.120
TRAVIS: Yeah, I will take both swipes at the dog

4708
03:09:31.120 --> 03:09:33.060
with the Summer Dance falchion.

4709
03:09:33.060 --> 03:09:34.490
MATT: Go for it.

4710
03:09:34.490 --> 03:09:36.350
LAURA: What are we going to do about this guy?

4711
03:09:36.350 --> 03:09:38.300
TRAVIS: Is Caduceus flanking him?

4712
03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:41.480
MATT: You could move in a way that would be flanking him.

4713
03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:44.313
I'll allow that.
TRAVIS: Okay, let's do that.

4714
03:09:45.397 --> 03:09:46.700
21 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

4715
03:09:46.700 --> 03:09:47.950
Go ahead and roll damage.

4716
03:09:47.950 --> 03:09:49.669
TRAVIS: Okay, all right.

4717
03:09:49.669 --> 03:09:50.502
Four.

4718
03:09:50.502 --> 03:09:52.690
12 points of slashing damage.

4719
03:09:52.690 --> 03:09:54.240
MATT: 12 points of slashing damage.

4720
03:09:55.620 --> 03:09:56.820
TRAVIS: Second one is a--

4721
03:09:56.820 --> 03:09:58.100
MATT: No, the first attack kills it.

4722
03:09:58.100 --> 03:09:59.210
TRAVIS: Oh.

4723
03:09:59.210 --> 03:10:01.010
LAURA: Oh, sweet.

4724
03:10:01.010 --> 03:10:04.400
MATT: It is scattered to the sky.

4725
03:10:04.400 --> 03:10:07.810
The shadow bursts and dissipates amongst the non-lit

4726
03:10:07.810 --> 03:10:09.030
corners of the chamber wall.

4727
03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:11.121
TRAVIS: Great.

4728
03:10:11.121 --> 03:10:12.500
Can I send some Eldritch...

4729
03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:14.660
No, I don't want to hit the fucking guy, do I?

4730
03:10:14.660 --> 03:10:16.020
MATT: Well, you used your attack action,

4731
03:10:16.020 --> 03:10:17.530
which means you have a second attack.

4732
03:10:17.530 --> 03:10:19.440
You can't use a cantrip, unfortunately.

4733
03:10:19.440 --> 03:10:20.713
TRAVIS: Cool.

4734
03:10:20.713 --> 03:10:21.770
MATT: You can move closer if you want to.

4735
03:10:21.770 --> 03:10:23.110
You have five more feet of movement.

4736
03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:24.512
TRAVIS: But I can't get in melee with anybody?

4737
03:10:24.512 --> 03:10:25.345
MATT: No.

4738
03:10:25.345 --> 03:10:27.790
TRAVIS: Is there anything I can do, bonus action-wise,

4739
03:10:27.790 --> 03:10:30.470
if I got near Caduceus to aid him in some way?

4740
03:10:30.470 --> 03:10:32.390
MATT: No, it's an action to try and use the help action.

4741
03:10:32.390 --> 03:10:33.223
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right.

4742
03:10:33.223 --> 03:10:37.050
Okay, I will not do anything.

4743
03:10:37.050 --> 03:10:38.140
TALIESIN: I--
TRAVIS: What?

4744
03:10:38.140 --> 03:10:40.357
TALIESIN: Yeah. Well, the only thing I can think to do

4745
03:10:40.357 --> 03:10:43.300
is like try and get this guy to burn a fucking

4746
03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:45.130
attack of opportunity.

4747
03:10:45.130 --> 03:10:47.670
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've only got five more feet of movement?

4748
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:48.503
You said?

4749
03:10:48.503 --> 03:10:49.841
MATT: You have about five more feet of movement, yeah.

4750
03:10:49.841 --> 03:10:51.880
TRAVIS: I'll move towards the wall.

4751
03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:53.590
I'll move towards the, there, okay.

4752
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:54.840
MATT: Okay, there you go.

4753
03:10:54.840 --> 03:10:56.000
That finishes Fjord's go.

4754
03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.623
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're just going to get frightened if--

4755
03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:01.210
MATT: All righty.

4756
03:11:01.210 --> 03:11:02.770
Yasha, it's your turn.

4757
03:11:02.770 --> 03:11:04.170
What's your movement speed?

4758
03:11:04.170 --> 03:11:05.120
ASHLEY: 40 feet.

4759
03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:09.130
TRAVIS: No, I only have two goddamn spell slots.

4760
03:11:09.130 --> 03:11:11.680
MATT: 30, 35.

4761
03:11:11.680 --> 03:11:12.837
ASHLEY: Is there--
LAURA: I don't know how this

4762
03:11:12.837 --> 03:11:14.450
is going to go.

4763
03:11:14.450 --> 03:11:17.150
MATT: Go ahead and make two attacks against the giant ape.

4764
03:11:18.310 --> 03:11:19.190
You have advantage on these

4765
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:21.240
because you are flanking with an ally.

4766
03:11:21.240 --> 03:11:22.960
LAURA: Did you see how fast he can fucking go?

4767
03:11:22.960 --> 03:11:24.443
ASHLEY: Did the flower

4768
03:11:24.443 --> 03:11:26.510
remind me of anything that Nott gave me?

4769
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:28.148
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

4770
03:11:28.148 --> 03:11:29.714
ASHLEY: Okay.

4771
03:11:31.686 --> 03:11:32.850
LIAM and MATT: With advantage.

4772
03:11:32.850 --> 03:11:35.338
ASHLEY: With advantage? Goddammit.

4773
03:11:35.338 --> 03:11:36.330
LAURA: Who are you attacking?

4774
03:11:36.330 --> 03:11:38.170
LIAM: Me.
TALIESIN: Caleb.

4775
03:11:38.170 --> 03:11:40.410
ASHLEY: 19 for the first hit.

4776
03:11:40.410 --> 03:11:42.418
MATT: 19 for the first hit, all right, does that hit?

4777
03:11:42.418 --> 03:11:43.251
LIAM: Yeah.

4778
03:11:43.251 --> 03:11:48.251
ASHLEY: Fuck, I hate this.

4779
03:11:50.130 --> 03:11:53.368
LAURA: Oh god.

4780
03:11:53.368 --> 03:11:54.580
ASHLEY: Okay.

4781
03:11:54.580 --> 03:11:56.138
TALIESIN: Oh man.

4782
03:11:58.780 --> 03:12:01.270
ASHLEY: 20 points of damage for the first hit.

4783
03:12:01.270 --> 03:12:03.370
MATT: All right, second attack with advantage.

4784
03:12:05.217 --> 03:12:06.430
ASHLEY: Oh fuck.

4785
03:12:09.640 --> 03:12:10.930
27.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

4786
03:12:10.930 --> 03:12:12.007
Roll the damage.

4787
03:12:14.715 --> 03:12:19.190
ASHLEY: Oh, thank god.

4788
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:21.450
11 points of damage.

4789
03:12:21.450 --> 03:12:22.620
MATT: All right.

4790
03:12:22.620 --> 03:12:25.210
And you use the last five feet of movement

4791
03:12:25.210 --> 03:12:28.020
to go ahead and shift over and engage with Jester.

4792
03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:31.010
LAURA: Wait, what, what was this?

4793
03:12:31.010 --> 03:12:32.920
MATT: Yasha finished the attacks on the barlgura

4794
03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:35.480
and then moved aside and just engaged with you.

4795
03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:37.097
Yasha is looking at you with angry eyes.

4796
03:12:37.097 --> 03:12:39.440
ASHLEY: Oh god.

4797
03:12:39.440 --> 03:12:41.040
MATT: All right.

4798
03:12:41.040 --> 03:12:43.753
That brings us to Beau.

4799
03:12:43.753 --> 03:12:44.586
LIAM: There is no stun now.

4800
03:12:44.586 --> 03:12:46.252
Caleb Gorilla is going to push through

4801
03:12:46.252 --> 03:12:47.618
between big sword hand

4802
03:12:47.618 --> 03:12:50.930
and Caduceus, like this with left arm, get in the way,

4803
03:12:50.930 --> 03:12:54.070
scoop up Cad and start to run.

4804
03:12:54.070 --> 03:12:55.640
I'm bigger than he is.

4805
03:12:55.640 --> 03:12:57.520
MATT: Okay, so you try and reach over and grab, then?

4806
03:12:57.520 --> 03:13:00.610
LIAM: Yeah, I'm taking him in like he's a baby monkey,

4807
03:13:00.610 --> 03:13:03.350
grapple my tum-tum and I'm just going to start running.

4808
03:13:03.350 --> 03:13:04.260
MATT: You got it.

4809
03:13:04.260 --> 03:13:06.200
All right, the Laughing Hand is going to

4810
03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:10.790
take an attack of opportunity against you.

4811
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:13.620
That is 19.

4812
03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:14.500
LIAM: Sure.

4813
03:13:14.500 --> 03:13:15.333
MATT: All right.

4814
03:13:16.600 --> 03:13:20.138
You take 23 points of slashing damage.

4815
03:13:20.138 --> 03:13:21.370
LIAM: Got it.

4816
03:13:22.660 --> 03:13:24.270
And 40 feet of movement.

4817
03:13:24.270 --> 03:13:25.103
MATT: All right.

4818
03:13:26.340 --> 03:13:27.173
SAM: Oh, you weren't frightened?

4819
03:13:27.173 --> 03:13:28.006
You got out of there?

4820
03:13:28.006 --> 03:13:29.790
LIAM: Nope.
SAM: Nice.

4821
03:13:29.790 --> 03:13:31.900
MATT: So you are now--
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4822
03:13:33.260 --> 03:13:34.976
MATT: Grabbed by the ape and brought aside.

4823
03:13:34.976 --> 03:13:37.143
LIAM: (panting)

4824
03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:39.170
MATT: All right.

4825
03:13:39.170 --> 03:13:40.820
That finishes your go.

4826
03:13:40.820 --> 03:13:41.653
Beau.

4827
03:13:41.653 --> 03:13:46.350
MARISHA: Am I, how far away am I from the angel statue?

4828
03:13:46.350 --> 03:13:48.130
Dagger, angel heart situation.

4829
03:13:48.130 --> 03:13:53.130
MATT: You're probably, I'd say 20 feet at this point.

4830
03:13:54.650 --> 03:13:56.400
You're not that far away at all.

4831
03:13:56.400 --> 03:13:59.040
MARISHA: Okay, I go over to that.

4832
03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:01.970
Did that, when we put the dagger in, did it open a door?

4833
03:14:01.970 --> 03:14:05.210
MATT: The dagger in the door broke like split in half

4834
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:06.043
and then opened.

4835
03:14:06.043 --> 03:14:06.900
There was a line in the center.

4836
03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:09.040
So now the door opened and one half of the angel's,

4837
03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:10.960
like the hand's still holding the dagger in it.

4838
03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:14.350
MARISHA: I'm going to go up and I'm going to,

4839
03:14:17.670 --> 03:14:20.400
I'm just going to pull it out and see if anything does.

4840
03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:21.600
MATT: Make a strength check.

4841
03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:23.160
MARISHA: Make a strength check.

4842
03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:24.070
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

4843
03:14:24.070 --> 03:14:26.060
LAURA: What if you close it and then--

4844
03:14:26.060 --> 03:14:27.070
MARISHA: I'll open it again.

4845
03:14:27.070 --> 03:14:31.055
TALIESIN: What if it disappears and the fuck, oh Jesus.

4846
03:14:31.055 --> 03:14:33.570
Oh fuck, it may happen.

4847
03:14:33.570 --> 03:14:34.660
MARISHA: Strength check?
MATT: Yes.

4848
03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:36.100
MARISHA: 19.

4849
03:14:36.100 --> 03:14:39.080
MATT: You pull the dagger out.

4850
03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:40.650
MARISHA: Put it back in.
MATT: Begins to close.

4851
03:14:40.650 --> 03:14:41.870
You can do that next turn.

4852
03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:42.703
MARISHA: Okay.

4853
03:14:42.703 --> 03:14:44.838
SAM: It begins to close?
MATT: Yeah.

4854
03:14:44.838 --> 03:14:46.160
MARISHA: How slow is it going?

4855
03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:47.420
MATT: Not terribly slow.

4856
03:14:47.420 --> 03:14:49.530
It's probably going to close the next round.

4857
03:14:49.530 --> 03:14:50.620
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

4858
03:14:50.620 --> 03:14:51.690
We're going to Indiana Jones this.

4859
03:14:51.690 --> 03:14:53.040
MARISHA: We're going to Indiana Jones this shit.

4860
03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:54.650
TALIESIN: Fuck.
SAM: If anyone had a whip,

4861
03:14:54.650 --> 03:14:56.670
they could get Yasha out.

4862
03:14:56.670 --> 03:15:01.230
MATT: All right, that brings us to Caduceus.

4863
03:15:02.310 --> 03:15:05.370
TALIESIN: I am going to-- fuck my life.

4864
03:15:05.370 --> 03:15:06.989
I am going to--

4865
03:15:06.989 --> 03:15:10.497
MARISHA: Is Caduceus and Caleb

4866
03:15:10.497 --> 03:15:12.280
on the other side of the door?

4867
03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:14.313
Are they out?

4868
03:15:18.952 --> 03:15:21.434
MATT: They're going to double run up to there.

4869
03:15:21.434 --> 03:15:22.400
Yeah, because I forgot to do my own turn.

4870
03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:25.140
MARISHA: Are they out of the door, of the range of the door?

4871
03:15:25.140 --> 03:15:26.850
MATT: You are a speed of what?

4872
03:15:26.850 --> 03:15:28.000
MARISHA: 40.
MATT: 40 feet?

4873
03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:29.290
No, they're not out yet.

4874
03:15:29.290 --> 03:15:32.890
They're right behind you.

4875
03:15:32.890 --> 03:15:34.100
So Caduceus, what you doing?

4876
03:15:34.100 --> 03:15:36.650
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Cure Wounds,

4877
03:15:36.650 --> 03:15:40.890
I guess, because fuck at 4th-level, because fuck.

4878
03:15:40.890 --> 03:15:42.348
MATT: Okay.

4879
03:15:42.348 --> 03:15:44.023
TALIESIN: On myself.

4880
03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:47.087
I am shaking so much.

4881
03:15:48.090 --> 03:15:51.256
That's a fuck-ton of d8.

4882
03:15:58.570 --> 03:16:00.030
I don't get a bonus on this

4883
03:16:00.030 --> 03:16:03.790
because of the closure thing healing.

4884
03:16:03.790 --> 03:16:05.170
No, yeah, healing myself.

4885
03:16:05.170 --> 03:16:06.003
MATT: Healing yourself,

4886
03:16:06.003 --> 03:16:08.500
the closure only helps if you're unconscious.

4887
03:16:08.500 --> 03:16:09.734
TALIESIN: I also thought it does a thing where it gives me--

4888
03:16:09.734 --> 03:16:10.880
LIAM: It does something with the hit dice.

4889
03:16:10.880 --> 03:16:12.663
MATT: That's hit dice, when you're healing--

4890
03:16:12.663 --> 03:16:14.430
TALIESIN: Okay.

4891
03:16:14.430 --> 03:16:15.730
MARISHA: Nott's right behind.

4892
03:16:16.937 --> 03:16:18.870
TALIESIN: Okay, that's better.

4893
03:16:18.870 --> 03:16:20.009
16.

4894
03:16:20.009 --> 03:16:22.880
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 points of heal.

4895
03:16:22.880 --> 03:16:23.870
MATT: 27 points of healing.

4896
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:28.200
TALIESIN: Which brings me up not nearly enough.

4897
03:16:28.200 --> 03:16:30.750
And yeah.

4898
03:16:32.740 --> 03:16:37.160
I don't really have anything else I can fucking do, can I?

4899
03:16:37.160 --> 03:16:40.020
Any bonus actions other than...

4900
03:16:40.020 --> 03:16:44.120
Actually, for my run, I'm going to hop out of your hands,

4901
03:16:44.120 --> 03:16:44.953
because I am--

4902
03:16:44.953 --> 03:16:45.786
LAURA: Can you move now?

4903
03:16:45.786 --> 03:16:47.140
TALIESIN: Yeah, I believe.

4904
03:16:47.140 --> 03:16:48.460
MATT: Okay, so you hop out of his hands.

4905
03:16:48.460 --> 03:16:50.000
TALIESIN: And I'm going to--
LIAM: I can take us 80 feet.

4906
03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:51.433
TALIESIN: I'm, hm?
LIAM: I can take us 80 feet,

4907
03:16:51.433 --> 03:16:52.620
but who knows what's going to happen.

4908
03:16:52.620 --> 03:16:53.453
MARISHA: Yeah, go, just go.

4909
03:16:53.453 --> 03:16:55.200
TALIESIN: I'm going to start booking.

4910
03:16:55.200 --> 03:16:57.250
MATT: Okay, so you run through the doors that are closing.

4911
03:16:57.250 --> 03:16:58.390
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4912
03:16:58.390 --> 03:16:59.720
MATT: You got it.

4913
03:16:59.720 --> 03:17:01.010
All right.

4914
03:17:01.010 --> 03:17:02.670
That brings us to Jester.

4915
03:17:04.330 --> 03:17:06.140
LAURA: Facing off with Yasha?

4916
03:17:06.140 --> 03:17:07.930
MATT: Yasha is engaged with you.

4917
03:17:07.930 --> 03:17:10.381
MARISHA: Oh shit.

4918
03:17:10.381 --> 03:17:11.473
Run.

4919
03:17:11.473 --> 03:17:12.329
Fucking run.

4920
03:17:12.329 --> 03:17:13.662
LAURA: Just run?
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of there.

4921
03:17:14.530 --> 03:17:17.330
TALIESIN: That or die are kind of the options at the moment.

4922
03:17:17.330 --> 03:17:19.297
ASHLEY: Run, bb.

4923
03:17:21.170 --> 03:17:22.753
TALIESIN: That's what's there.

4924
03:17:24.827 --> 03:17:26.390
SAM: Oh boy.

4925
03:17:26.390 --> 03:17:27.223
Oh boy.

4926
03:17:27.223 --> 03:17:28.700
LAURA: I'm going to try.

4927
03:17:28.700 --> 03:17:30.590
How far away from the door am I, really far?

4928
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:32.730
MATT: From there, you're about 60 feet away.

4929
03:17:32.730 --> 03:17:33.563
TALIESIN: Fuck.

4930
03:17:33.563 --> 03:17:34.396
TRAVIS: Double up.

4931
03:17:34.396 --> 03:17:35.770
LAURA: So I can double dash and try to get out?

4932
03:17:35.770 --> 03:17:38.728
MATT: Double dash and you'll reach the door, yeah.

4933
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:43.145
LAURA: I'm just going to say:

4934
03:17:44.069 --> 03:17:46.760
Snap out of it, Yasha.

4935
03:17:46.760 --> 03:17:49.470
Oh no, I hate it.

4936
03:17:49.470 --> 03:17:51.630
And I'm going to run for the door.

4937
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:52.710
MARISHA: Okay.

4938
03:17:52.710 --> 03:17:54.270
Make a Sentinel attack against Jester.

4939
03:17:54.270 --> 03:17:56.323
SAM: Oh nos.

4940
03:17:58.143 --> 03:18:03.143
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

4941
03:18:08.010 --> 03:18:10.090
MATT: Just an attack roll.

4942
03:18:10.090 --> 03:18:11.567
ASHLEY: 20.

4943
03:18:11.567 --> 03:18:12.780
MATT: Does that hit?

4944
03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:15.000
LAURA: I've got one mirror duplicate.

4945
03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:16.513
MATT: Go ahead and roll.
TALIESIN: Lord Almighty, please.

4946
03:18:16.513 --> 03:18:19.128
MARISHA: Oh my god.
SAM: Go boy, go boy.

4947
03:18:19.128 --> 03:18:21.210
J'go, boy.

4948
03:18:21.210 --> 03:18:22.520
That's cocked.

4949
03:18:22.520 --> 03:18:23.800
MATT: Roll again.

4950
03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:26.080
LAURA: I need an 11 or higher, 16.

4951
03:18:26.080 --> 03:18:27.570
TALIESIN: Thank fucking god.

4952
03:18:28.680 --> 03:18:30.770
MATT: The mirror image takes the final blow

4953
03:18:30.770 --> 03:18:33.720
as Yasha's Skingorger slams into the ground.

4954
03:18:33.720 --> 03:18:36.050
You feel the energy dissipate behind you

4955
03:18:36.050 --> 03:18:39.290
as you dart forward, double move rushing just

4956
03:18:39.290 --> 03:18:40.820
beyond the closing doors.

4957
03:18:42.640 --> 03:18:44.860
That is some fucking luck.

4958
03:18:44.860 --> 03:18:48.251
TRAVIS: Wow.
TALIESIN: Not okay.

4959
03:18:48.251 --> 03:18:52.170
TRAVIS: Wow, good call with the Mirror Image.

4960
03:18:52.170 --> 03:18:53.020
MATT: Nott, it's your turn.

4961
03:18:53.020 --> 03:18:54.470
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

4962
03:18:54.470 --> 03:18:55.960
SAM: Boy, Fjord, you're still in there?

4963
03:18:55.960 --> 03:18:56.793
You have enough...

4964
03:18:56.793 --> 03:18:57.940
He's going to get out, he's got all sorts

4965
03:18:57.940 --> 03:18:59.690
of Thunder Steppy things.

4966
03:18:59.690 --> 03:19:00.540
LAURA: No, he doesn't.

4967
03:19:00.540 --> 03:19:01.373
SAM: You don't?

4968
03:19:01.373 --> 03:19:02.630
You can get out, right?

4969
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:04.580
How far is Fjord from the door?

4970
03:19:04.580 --> 03:19:07.130
MATT: Fjord is about, a little closer.

4971
03:19:07.130 --> 03:19:08.770
He's about 50 feet.

4972
03:19:08.770 --> 03:19:10.460
SAM: He'll make it.

4973
03:19:10.460 --> 03:19:11.293
He'll make it.

4974
03:19:12.390 --> 03:19:14.770
How far am I from the door, 30 feet?

4975
03:19:14.770 --> 03:19:16.190
MATT: You're about 30 feet from it, yeah.

4976
03:19:16.190 --> 03:19:18.915
SAM: I will step forward ten feet

4977
03:19:18.915 --> 03:19:21.381
towards the big bad mama-jama.

4978
03:19:21.381 --> 03:19:22.570
MATT: All right.

4979
03:19:22.570 --> 03:19:26.950
SAM: Throw my tanglefoot bag

4980
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:28.130
at him.

4981
03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:31.640
Well, between him and Yasha if I can get an area.

4982
03:19:31.640 --> 03:19:33.930
I don't actually know how tanglefoot bags work.

4983
03:19:33.930 --> 03:19:36.820
MATT: I'm telling you right now, it essentially works

4984
03:19:36.820 --> 03:19:38.310
as a 20-foot radius Entangle,

4985
03:19:38.310 --> 03:19:39.650
sorry, a ten-foot radius Entangle spell.

4986
03:19:39.650 --> 03:19:41.110
So go ahead and roll an attack.

4987
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:43.270
Just roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

4988
03:19:43.270 --> 03:19:45.474
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
SAM: Come on.

4989
03:19:45.474 --> 03:19:46.990
TALIESIN: Dude, you got anything left?

4990
03:19:46.990 --> 03:19:48.600
SAM: Oh, not great, not great.

4991
03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:49.620
14.

4992
03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:52.510
MATT: 14, okay, that's enough to hit the space there.

4993
03:19:52.510 --> 03:19:54.330
Now he gets to make a strength saving throw

4994
03:19:54.330 --> 03:19:56.840
or be restrained by them for the next round.

4995
03:19:56.840 --> 03:19:59.260
LAURA: Natural one.

4996
03:19:59.260 --> 03:20:00.093
MATT: A 16.

4997
03:20:00.093 --> 03:20:01.759
Yeah, no, he resisted.

4998
03:20:01.759 --> 03:20:03.770
The vines wrap around the legs and he just like

4999
03:20:03.770 --> 03:20:05.200
snaps them with his legs.

5000
03:20:05.200 --> 03:20:07.470
SAM: Well then, I'll turn around and run out the door.

5001
03:20:07.470 --> 03:20:09.330
Fjord, come, come now.

5002
03:20:09.330 --> 03:20:11.420
MATT: You have enough movement with your bonus action

5003
03:20:11.420 --> 03:20:14.360
to make your way into the next space.

5004
03:20:14.360 --> 03:20:16.650
TALIESIN: Fuck, dude.

5005
03:20:16.650 --> 03:20:18.130
MATT: I'll put you right there, we know where you are.

5006
03:20:18.130 --> 03:20:19.110
TALIESIN: Fuck, dude.

5007
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:20.970
MATT: So Nott rushes through.

5008
03:20:20.970 --> 03:20:23.560
That brings us to Obann's turn.

5009
03:20:23.560 --> 03:20:25.890
Obann, sorry, the Laughing Hand's turn.

5010
03:20:25.890 --> 03:20:27.106
TALIESIN: Fuck, dude.

5011
03:20:27.106 --> 03:20:29.635
TRAVIS: I came back in.

5012
03:20:29.635 --> 03:20:33.143
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

5013
03:20:33.143 --> 03:20:34.300
LAURA: (gasps)

5014
03:20:34.300 --> 03:20:38.252
MATT: The shadow hound's going to turn over this way.

5015
03:20:38.252 --> 03:20:39.670
LAURA: (gasps)

5016
03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:41.490
MARISHA: Yeah, oh shit.

5017
03:20:41.490 --> 03:20:44.107
SAM: Oh, you're flanked now.

5018
03:20:46.536 --> 03:20:49.727
MATT: So first it's going to make a slam attack against you.

5019
03:20:50.840 --> 03:20:53.040
That is a 24 to hit.

5020
03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:54.200
It is not going to do any damage.

5021
03:20:54.200 --> 03:20:55.720
Instead, he's going to grapple you.

5022
03:20:55.720 --> 03:20:58.060
SAM: Oh no!

5023
03:20:58.060 --> 03:20:59.140
MATT: While you are grappled,

5024
03:20:59.140 --> 03:21:01.420
you are also restrained in this way.

5025
03:21:01.420 --> 03:21:02.253
TALIESIN: Fuck.

5026
03:21:03.350 --> 03:21:06.347
MATT: He's going to make two blade arm attacks against you.

5027
03:21:07.273 --> 03:21:08.106
SAM: The door's closing.

5028
03:21:08.106 --> 03:21:11.180
MATT: That's going to be a 19 to hit.

5029
03:21:11.180 --> 03:21:12.319
TALIESIN: Hits.

5030
03:21:12.319 --> 03:21:14.090
ASHLEY: Goddammit.

5031
03:21:14.090 --> 03:21:16.856
MATT: You take...

5032
03:21:18.531 --> 03:21:20.282
17 points of slashing damage.

5033
03:21:20.282 --> 03:21:21.913
TRAVIS: Okay.

5034
03:21:21.913 --> 03:21:26.913
MATT: And the second attack is going to be a

5035
03:21:27.204 --> 03:21:28.395
29 to hit.

5036
03:21:28.395 --> 03:21:30.363
TRAVIS: Hits.

5037
03:21:30.363 --> 03:21:31.196
MATT: That is not a great damage roll.

5038
03:21:31.196 --> 03:21:36.188
That is going to be 14 points of slashing damage.

5039
03:21:37.150 --> 03:21:38.090
That finishes his turn.

5040
03:21:38.090 --> 03:21:41.970
The hound is now going to strike you from behind.

5041
03:21:41.970 --> 03:21:43.070
MATT: That's a tough roll.

5042
03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:44.540
That's a 11.

5043
03:21:44.540 --> 03:21:45.373
TRAVIS: Misses.

5044
03:21:45.373 --> 03:21:46.206
MATT: Misses you.

5045
03:21:46.206 --> 03:21:47.510
Tries to bite at you.

5046
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:50.282
SAM: Okay.
MATT: All right.

5047
03:21:51.420 --> 03:21:53.830
That finishes the Laughing Hand's turn.

5048
03:21:53.830 --> 03:21:55.370
LAURA: He's still alive--
LIAM: But he's held in place.

5049
03:21:55.370 --> 03:21:57.850
MARISHA: So he's like fucking stuck.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5050
03:21:57.850 --> 03:21:59.459
MATT: It's your turn, Fjord.

5051
03:21:59.459 --> 03:22:01.010
MARISHA: To do another Thunder Step?

5052
03:22:01.010 --> 03:22:01.980
TRAVIS: No, I have no slots.

5053
03:22:01.980 --> 03:22:03.610
But at the start of my turn...

5054
03:22:03.610 --> 03:22:05.930
MATT: You have to make a wisdom save.

5055
03:22:05.930 --> 03:22:07.392
SAM: Oh god.

5056
03:22:10.163 --> 03:22:11.880
TRAVIS: This is disgusting.

5057
03:22:11.880 --> 03:22:14.050
SAM: This is brutal.

5058
03:22:14.050 --> 03:22:15.483
Oh my god.

5059
03:22:16.940 --> 03:22:17.773
TRAVIS: 13.

5060
03:22:17.773 --> 03:22:20.320
MATT: 13, you are racked by fear.

5061
03:22:20.320 --> 03:22:22.010
The fright seizes your body.

5062
03:22:22.010 --> 03:22:24.490
You cannot move and you are frightened.

5063
03:22:24.490 --> 03:22:26.350
You still have your actions.

5064
03:22:26.350 --> 03:22:27.190
TRAVIS: I do?

5065
03:22:27.190 --> 03:22:28.730
MATT: Yeah, just like your action, you just can't move

5066
03:22:28.730 --> 03:22:31.428
and your attacks are at disadvantage.

5067
03:22:32.740 --> 03:22:37.740
TRAVIS: I will turn towards the hounds

5068
03:22:38.006 --> 03:22:42.889
and sickeningly take two swipes at

5069
03:22:42.889 --> 03:22:45.905
the shadow dog.

5070
03:22:45.905 --> 03:22:48.776
MATT: Go for it.

5071
03:22:48.776 --> 03:22:50.973
TRAVIS: That's cocked.

5072
03:22:50.973 --> 03:22:53.270
MATT and TRAVIS: Cocked again.

5073
03:22:53.270 --> 03:22:56.538
TRAVIS: 23 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

5074
03:22:58.060 --> 03:23:00.790
TRAVIS: That's 14 points of slashing damage.

5075
03:23:00.790 --> 03:23:02.150
MATT: 14 points slashing damage, you got it.

5076
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:04.100
TRAVIS: Second one--
MATT: And that finishes him.

5077
03:23:04.100 --> 03:23:06.320
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god.

5078
03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:09.540
MATT: He was still damaged from the attack earlier.

5079
03:23:09.540 --> 03:23:11.880
So yeah, that takes out that last shadow hound.

5080
03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:13.350
You still have one more attack.

5081
03:23:13.350 --> 03:23:14.320
TRAVIS: I'll swing it.

5082
03:23:14.320 --> 03:23:19.111
I'll turn around and face my...

5083
03:23:19.111 --> 03:23:24.103
face my attacker and a 23 to hit.

5084
03:23:24.103 --> 03:23:26.815
MATT: 23 to hit, go ahead and roll.

5085
03:23:28.530 --> 03:23:31.090
TRAVIS: 12 points of slashing damage.

5086
03:23:31.090 --> 03:23:33.070
MATT: Got it.

5087
03:23:33.070 --> 03:23:34.210
Barely moves from the impact.

5088
03:23:34.210 --> 03:23:35.790
The blade almost sinks in and stops

5089
03:23:35.790 --> 03:23:37.480
and you have to wedge it out.

5090
03:23:37.480 --> 03:23:40.910
You feel your hand shaking with your blade in your grasp.

5091
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:44.640
TRAVIS: I can do nothing else.

5092
03:23:44.640 --> 03:23:46.003
That is my turn.

5093
03:23:46.003 --> 03:23:48.170
MATT: All right.

5094
03:23:48.170 --> 03:23:50.398
That brings us to Yasha's turn.

5095
03:23:57.716 --> 03:23:58.790
TRAVIS: Shit.

5096
03:24:00.460 --> 03:24:04.611
MATT: Make two attacks against Fjord, Yasha, Reckless.

5097
03:24:04.611 --> 03:24:05.860
ASHLEY: (sighs)

5098
03:24:05.860 --> 03:24:07.747
Okay.

5099
03:24:07.747 --> 03:24:09.300
LAURA: Oh no.

5100
03:24:09.300 --> 03:24:10.925
TRAVIS: Natural 20?

5101
03:24:12.330 --> 03:24:14.390
Very astute, man.

5102
03:24:14.390 --> 03:24:16.367
ASHLEY: Fuck.
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

5103
03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:24.450
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

5104
03:24:24.450 --> 03:24:26.190
LAURA: Why is it so good?

5105
03:24:26.190 --> 03:24:30.282
Why are you rolling so good when you're not being Yasha?

5106
03:24:31.220 --> 03:24:32.053
ASHLEY: Okay.

5107
03:24:35.700 --> 03:24:39.560
I rolled 16 plus seven, so I don't know if you...

5108
03:24:39.560 --> 03:24:41.040
MATT: 16 is what you rolled?

5109
03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:43.940
So that would be 34 plus seven.

5110
03:24:43.940 --> 03:24:45.460
ASHLEY: And then you add the seven after.

5111
03:24:45.460 --> 03:24:48.100
MATT: Correct, and you roll an additional d6 on top of that.

5112
03:24:48.100 --> 03:24:50.490
LAURA: So 41 plus another d6.

5113
03:24:51.450 --> 03:24:52.780
ASHLEY: Plus another d6?
LAURA: Yeah.

5114
03:24:52.780 --> 03:24:55.310
TALIESIN: Holy fuck.

5115
03:24:55.310 --> 03:24:56.570
LAURA: 43.

5116
03:24:56.570 --> 03:24:58.050
MATT: 43 points of slashing damage.

5117
03:24:58.050 --> 03:25:02.030
TRAVIS: So you see Fjord take it, fall backwards,

5118
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:05.600
he uses his one half-orc Relentless Endurance

5119
03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:08.110
to stagger himself and put one hand on the wall

5120
03:25:08.110 --> 03:25:08.943
and just look up at you.

5121
03:25:08.943 --> 03:25:10.680
MATT: Still being held by the Laughing Hand, by the way.

5122
03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:12.120
SAM: Whoa, okay, okay, okay.

5123
03:25:12.120 --> 03:25:15.396
MATT: Make a second attack.
SAM: He's fine.

5124
03:25:15.396 --> 03:25:20.384
TRAVIS: And I'll say, I'll look at Yasha and go: Why?

5125
03:25:25.320 --> 03:25:28.020
ASHLEY: 16 for the second hit.

5126
03:25:28.020 --> 03:25:30.828
TRAVIS: Misses.
ASHLEY: Thank god.

5127
03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:33.791
I heard you.

5128
03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:37.320
SAM: Oh gosh.

5129
03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:39.610
MATT: Her voice comes through.

5130
03:25:39.610 --> 03:25:42.060
She's still looking at you intently,

5131
03:25:42.060 --> 03:25:44.960
a burning grin on her face, but she still says,

5132
03:25:44.960 --> 03:25:49.082
almost disembodied, "I heard you."

5133
03:25:49.082 --> 03:25:51.790
That finishes Yasha's turn.

5134
03:25:51.790 --> 03:25:54.157
Beau and Caleb.

5135
03:25:55.130 --> 03:25:57.100
SAM: Come on, guys.

5136
03:25:57.100 --> 03:25:58.803
LAURA: Save him.

5137
03:25:58.803 --> 03:26:00.770
MARISHA: I'm going to try to open the door back up.

5138
03:26:00.770 --> 03:26:03.060
MATT: The door is closing now.

5139
03:26:03.060 --> 03:26:04.370
SAM: Were you going to...

5140
03:26:04.370 --> 03:26:06.253
MATT: You're going to have to use--

5141
03:26:06.253 --> 03:26:07.387
MARISHA: Is it closed closed?

5142
03:26:07.387 --> 03:26:08.220
MATT: It's closing on your turn.

5143
03:26:08.220 --> 03:26:10.470
So if you want to try and keep it back open,

5144
03:26:10.470 --> 03:26:14.351
you have to use your action to put the dagger back in it.

5145
03:26:15.996 --> 03:26:17.160
SAM: Yeah.

5146
03:26:17.160 --> 03:26:19.652
MATT: What are you doing?

5147
03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:23.933
LIAM: I'm at the door and the door just

5148
03:26:23.933 --> 03:26:24.766
closed in front of me,

5149
03:26:24.766 --> 03:26:25.599
is that what I'm--

5150
03:26:25.599 --> 03:26:26.930
MATT: It's in the process of closing.

5151
03:26:26.930 --> 03:26:28.880
LIAM: But it's not big enough for a giant ape

5152
03:26:28.880 --> 03:26:30.320
to go through, or is it?

5153
03:26:30.320 --> 03:26:32.050
MATT and LIAM: No.

5154
03:26:32.050 --> 03:26:33.540
MARISHA: I'll put it back in.

5155
03:26:33.540 --> 03:26:34.660
MATT: Okay, so you use your action.

5156
03:26:34.660 --> 03:26:36.750
The door halts and starts re-opening.

5157
03:26:41.436 --> 03:26:42.860
You have your movement still and your bonus action.

5158
03:26:42.860 --> 03:26:44.660
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

5159
03:26:49.530 --> 03:26:53.000
MARISHA: I, movement, bonus action.

5160
03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.150
LAURA: It smells like poop.

5161
03:26:56.153 --> 03:26:58.972
SAM: It's this Japanese liquor thing.

5162
03:26:58.972 --> 03:26:59.880
What's it called, hinoki?

5163
03:26:59.880 --> 03:27:01.210
MARISHA: Can I move up to Yasha?

5164
03:27:01.210 --> 03:27:04.430
Do I have enough move to move up to Yasha?

5165
03:27:04.430 --> 03:27:08.410
MATT: It is a, she is about 50 feet from you.

5166
03:27:08.410 --> 03:27:12.000
So at the door, yeah, with your move, you can get up to her.

5167
03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:13.550
LAURA: Is Fjord still grappled?

5168
03:27:13.550 --> 03:27:15.320
MATT: Fjord is still held, yeah.

5169
03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:17.300
TRAVIS: Just by fear.

5170
03:27:17.300 --> 03:27:19.325
MATT: Well, fear and you're still grappled by

5171
03:27:19.325 --> 03:27:20.441
the Laughing Hand.

5172
03:27:20.441 --> 03:27:22.920
TRAVIS: (laughs)

5173
03:27:22.920 --> 03:27:25.470
ASHLEY: So even though you did the--

5174
03:27:25.470 --> 03:27:26.790
TRAVIS: I'm covered in blood.

5175
03:27:26.790 --> 03:27:29.760
ASHLEY: You went unconscious, you still are grappled?

5176
03:27:29.760 --> 03:27:31.740
TRAVIS: Barely here.

5177
03:27:31.740 --> 03:27:32.573
ASHLEY: Fuck.

5178
03:27:32.573 --> 03:27:33.450
LIAM: You want to do something simultaneously

5179
03:27:33.450 --> 03:27:35.520
or do we wait for?
MATT: Yeah, I'm allowing it.

5180
03:27:35.520 --> 03:27:37.990
LIAM: Yeah okay, so the gorilla form just drops

5181
03:27:37.990 --> 03:27:40.360
and Caleb is here reaching into his pocket

5182
03:27:40.360 --> 03:27:42.360
and puts some phosphorous down into his hand

5183
03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:45.230
and squelches his hand through it and a Wall of Fire

5184
03:27:45.230 --> 03:27:50.230
stretches out, splitting Fjord from them on a deep angle

5185
03:27:50.520 --> 03:27:53.390
that is almost parallel to the wall, but at an angle,

5186
03:27:53.390 --> 03:27:55.450
and the damage side will of course be towards

5187
03:27:55.450 --> 03:27:59.740
Yasha and the creep and not harming Fjord at all

5188
03:27:59.740 --> 03:28:02.450
and will make a straight line for Fjord to run

5189
03:28:02.450 --> 03:28:05.238
along towards the exit and where I am.

5190
03:28:05.238 --> 03:28:09.030
SAM: Follow the light.

5191
03:28:09.030 --> 03:28:11.270
LIAM: Actually, I don't know how to communicate this.

5192
03:28:12.312 --> 03:28:16.140
I was picturing the fire not curving around them

5193
03:28:16.140 --> 03:28:19.480
but making a line towards Caleb there,

5194
03:28:19.480 --> 03:28:23.202
like a runway for Fjord towards the door.

5195
03:28:23.202 --> 03:28:25.460
MATT: Okay.

5196
03:28:25.460 --> 03:28:26.293
SAM: Nice, nice.

5197
03:28:26.293 --> 03:28:27.260
MATT: Do they take the damage immediately

5198
03:28:27.260 --> 03:28:28.110
or is it on their turn?

5199
03:28:28.110 --> 03:28:29.820
I think it's on their turn, right?

5200
03:28:29.820 --> 03:28:31.550
LIAM: I think so, yeah.
MATT: You got it.

5201
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:32.950
Okay.

5202
03:28:32.950 --> 03:28:34.668
That's your action?

5203
03:28:34.668 --> 03:28:37.840
LIAM: Yeah, and I will back up as close to the door...

5204
03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:40.070
No, the door is opened, I will back up--

5205
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:41.700
MATT: Into the room?
LIAM: My 30 feet back, yeah.

5206
03:28:41.700 --> 03:28:43.450
MATT: You got it.

5207
03:28:43.450 --> 03:28:44.740
Okay.

5208
03:28:44.740 --> 03:28:46.840
MARISHA: Who's next to me?

5209
03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:49.610
MARISHA: Next to you right now would be Jester.

5210
03:28:49.610 --> 03:28:50.930
Jester is right next to you.

5211
03:28:50.930 --> 03:28:52.250
Nott's a little further in.

5212
03:28:52.250 --> 03:28:55.590
Caduceus, you ran into the chamber as well.

5213
03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:58.320
So both Jester and Caduceus are right next to you.

5214
03:28:58.320 --> 03:29:01.370
MARISHA: I'm going to, as I dart back off,

5215
03:29:01.370 --> 03:29:05.430
I'm going to hand the dagger to Jester as I run by,

5216
03:29:05.430 --> 03:29:09.970
grab Fjord, and try and run him and--

5217
03:29:09.970 --> 03:29:11.210
MATT: So you're going to dart back.

5218
03:29:11.210 --> 03:29:13.280
MARISHA: I'm going to dart back for my move.

5219
03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:17.770
MATT: Okay, so, that would be 45 feet to get up to Fjord.

5220
03:29:17.770 --> 03:29:18.860
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

5221
03:29:18.860 --> 03:29:20.320
MATT: You got it, you're up to him.

5222
03:29:23.710 --> 03:29:28.080
MARISHA: And then can I grab him and use Step of the Wind

5223
03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:30.000
and try and drag him back out of the door

5224
03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:30.833
as quickly as I can?

5225
03:29:30.833 --> 03:29:32.310
MATT: You can certainly try.

5226
03:29:32.310 --> 03:29:33.985
MARISHA: That's what I'm going to try and do.

5227
03:29:33.985 --> 03:29:37.480
LIAM: Also, the spell says creature takes damage

5228
03:29:37.480 --> 03:29:39.300
when it enters the wall for the first time

5229
03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:41.420
on a turn or ends its turn there.

5230
03:29:41.420 --> 03:29:43.320
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: They're technically in it.

5231
03:29:43.320 --> 03:29:46.230
So would it trigger when we get to the start of their turn?

5232
03:29:46.230 --> 03:29:47.950
Because otherwise they could just walk out of it and--

5233
03:29:47.950 --> 03:29:49.616
MATT: You know, that's true. We can do the damage now.

5234
03:29:49.616 --> 03:29:51.550
So go ahead and roll.

5235
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:53.390
LIAM: This spell confuses me.
MATT: I know.

5236
03:29:53.390 --> 03:29:55.150
It's a little finicky, so.

5237
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:56.500
LIAM: 5d8.

5238
03:29:58.820 --> 03:30:00.436
12.

5239
03:30:01.700 --> 03:30:02.860
MATT: That's dex save, right?

5240
03:30:02.860 --> 03:30:03.990
LIAM: 24, yeah.

5241
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:05.240
MATT: Roll a dex save, Yasha.

5242
03:30:09.980 --> 03:30:12.280
ASHLEY: Get advantage on dex.

5243
03:30:12.280 --> 03:30:13.988
MATT: 16?

5244
03:30:14.830 --> 03:30:15.663
LIAM: No, 17.

5245
03:30:15.663 --> 03:30:16.496
MATT: 17, yeah.

5246
03:30:16.496 --> 03:30:17.329
So full damage on the Laughing Hand.

5247
03:30:17.329 --> 03:30:18.310
What's the damage on that?

5248
03:30:18.310 --> 03:30:19.143
LIAM: 24.

5249
03:30:19.143 --> 03:30:19.976
MATT: 24 fire damage.

5250
03:30:19.976 --> 03:30:20.840
And what did you roll?

5251
03:30:20.840 --> 03:30:22.180
ASHLEY: 13, so I failed.

5252
03:30:22.180 --> 03:30:24.400
MATT: 13, so you take another 24 points of fire damage.

5253
03:30:25.300 --> 03:30:26.900
All right, so you're trying to pull--

5254
03:30:26.900 --> 03:30:30.110
MARISHA: I'm going to take him and throw his arms

5255
03:30:30.110 --> 03:30:32.250
over me into the backpack maneuver

5256
03:30:32.250 --> 03:30:34.190
and lift him up and see how far I can get.

5257
03:30:34.190 --> 03:30:35.450
MATT: Make a strength check because you're pulling

5258
03:30:35.450 --> 03:30:36.540
against the Laughing Hand's strength

5259
03:30:36.540 --> 03:30:38.540
because he's still grappling him.

5260
03:30:38.540 --> 03:30:41.020
LAURA: Even through the fire?

5261
03:30:41.020 --> 03:30:42.450
MATT: No, yeah, it's still holding onto him.

5262
03:30:42.450 --> 03:30:45.520
You see the hand holding Fjord out of the flames

5263
03:30:45.520 --> 03:30:46.810
as it's burning him.

5264
03:30:46.810 --> 03:30:49.390
MARISHA: This is going to fucking fail.

5265
03:30:49.390 --> 03:30:51.680
SAM: You're strong.
MARISHA: No, I'm not.

5266
03:30:51.680 --> 03:30:52.780
Okay.
LIAM: High roll.

5267
03:30:52.780 --> 03:30:54.850
MARISHA: Wait, just a straight strength?

5268
03:30:54.850 --> 03:30:56.280
MATT: Strength, add your strength bonus, yeah.

5269
03:30:56.280 --> 03:30:58.460
MARISHA: I have no bonus, so 18.

5270
03:30:58.460 --> 03:30:59.770
MATT: Fuck, he rolled a 16.

5271
03:30:59.770 --> 03:31:00.700
(cheering)

5272
03:31:00.700 --> 03:31:03.150
No joke.

5273
03:31:03.150 --> 03:31:04.780
I was like, there's no way you're going to beat that.

5274
03:31:04.780 --> 03:31:08.120
MARISHA: No, there was no way I should've beat that.

5275
03:31:08.120 --> 03:31:10.520
LIAM: Your arms are flexing on the verge of tearing.

5276
03:31:12.898 --> 03:31:15.388
MARISHA: A little turd squeezes out, just a little.

5277
03:31:15.388 --> 03:31:18.190
(laughter)

5278
03:31:18.190 --> 03:31:20.893
MATT: All right, all right, no, I said I'd allow it. Okay.

5279
03:31:20.893 --> 03:31:25.026
So you manage to rip Fjord out of

5280
03:31:25.026 --> 03:31:27.210
the Laughing Hand's grasp,

5281
03:31:27.210 --> 03:31:29.380
the laughter still burbling from through the flames

5282
03:31:29.380 --> 03:31:31.630
you hear the burning sound of the fire

5283
03:31:31.630 --> 03:31:33.830
as all the voices are still pushing through.

5284
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:37.310
And pulling him away,

5285
03:31:37.310 --> 03:31:39.820
Step of the Wind, dragging somebody the same speed as you

5286
03:31:39.820 --> 03:31:40.900
means you move half speed.

5287
03:31:40.900 --> 03:31:41.733
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah.

5288
03:31:41.733 --> 03:31:44.150
MATT: So you manage to pull Fjord 20 feet.

5289
03:31:45.193 --> 03:31:48.173
So you guys are about there. Okay.

5290
03:31:48.173 --> 03:31:49.031
LAURA: Who's next in initiative?

5291
03:31:49.031 --> 03:31:50.089
Am I? Okay.

5292
03:31:50.089 --> 03:31:51.938
MARISHA: So we're not out, we're not out.

5293
03:31:51.938 --> 03:31:54.140
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

5294
03:31:54.140 --> 03:31:56.340
TALIESIN: I am...

5295
03:31:56.340 --> 03:32:01.250
holding a healing spell for anybody going down.

5296
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:03.100
MATT: Okay, what healing spell?

5297
03:32:03.100 --> 03:32:04.891
Healing Word?

5298
03:32:06.019 --> 03:32:07.410
TALIESIN: What's it called?

5299
03:32:07.410 --> 03:32:10.605
Because my brain is made of panic.

5300
03:32:13.660 --> 03:32:15.770
Healing Word, yeah.

5301
03:32:15.770 --> 03:32:17.360
MATT: You got it, so if anybody drops to zero--

5302
03:32:17.360 --> 03:32:19.360
TALIESIN: Anyone drops to zero, I'm shooting Healing Word.

5303
03:32:19.360 --> 03:32:20.420
MATT: Jester, you're up.

5304
03:32:20.420 --> 03:32:21.970
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to--
MATT: You have the dagger.

5305
03:32:21.970 --> 03:32:23.310
LAURA: Nott's standing next to me?

5306
03:32:23.310 --> 03:32:24.540
MATT: Yes.

5307
03:32:24.540 --> 03:32:27.950
LAURA: Passing Nott the dagger and I'm going to use the whip

5308
03:32:29.290 --> 03:32:33.570
to whip at Yasha and Fjord and yank 'em out the door.

5309
03:32:33.570 --> 03:32:35.410
MATT: Choose one.

5310
03:32:35.410 --> 03:32:37.169
MARISHA: Beau and Fjord.

5311
03:32:37.169 --> 03:32:38.170
LAURA: Sorry, Beau and Fjord.

5312
03:32:38.170 --> 03:32:39.410
Because she's holding onto Fjord.

5313
03:32:39.410 --> 03:32:40.910
MATT: So you're grabbing Beau.
LAURA: Yeah.

5314
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:42.643
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

5315
03:32:42.643 --> 03:32:46.263
MARISHA: Oh my god, come on.

5316
03:32:47.307 --> 03:32:48.470
Hit me.

5317
03:32:48.470 --> 03:32:50.500
LAURA: Is it like--
LIAM: It's just AC.

5318
03:32:50.500 --> 03:32:51.730
SAM: It's right here.

5319
03:32:51.730 --> 03:32:52.900
LAURA: I know, I know, but--
MATT: You're not trying

5320
03:32:52.900 --> 03:32:54.890
to dodge it, so I'll give you advantage on it.

5321
03:32:54.890 --> 03:32:55.723
LAURA: Okay.

5322
03:32:58.410 --> 03:32:59.910
What was that, that wouldn't hit her.

5323
03:32:59.910 --> 03:33:00.810
LIAM: Seven or a nine.

5324
03:33:01.650 --> 03:33:03.170
LAURA: 14?

5325
03:33:03.170 --> 03:33:04.350
MATT: 14.

5326
03:33:04.350 --> 03:33:06.940
It's less of her allowing it but just your aim with it

5327
03:33:06.940 --> 03:33:10.315
isn't quite fair enough.

5328
03:33:10.315 --> 03:33:13.410
It cracks about two feet to the left.

5329
03:33:13.410 --> 03:33:15.560
The loud impact causes your ears to ring a bit.

5330
03:33:15.560 --> 03:33:16.560
LAURA: Can't you grab things?

5331
03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:20.710
Can't you catch things as a reaction coming at you?

5332
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:22.130
MATT: Missiles.

5333
03:33:22.130 --> 03:33:26.480
LAURA: But it's like a ranged thing coming at her.

5334
03:33:26.480 --> 03:33:28.914
MATT: Roll a dexterity saving throw.

5335
03:33:28.914 --> 03:33:29.808
MARISHA: A save?

5336
03:33:29.808 --> 03:33:31.320
MATT: A save, yeah.

5337
03:33:31.320 --> 03:33:33.220
MARISHA: Okay.

5338
03:33:35.290 --> 03:33:36.420
12.

5339
03:33:36.420 --> 03:33:38.708
MATT: 12?

5340
03:33:38.708 --> 03:33:39.900
Uh.

5341
03:33:39.900 --> 03:33:41.110
I'll say you're not quite quick enough

5342
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:42.030
to grab it, unfortunately.

5343
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:44.440
You reach out for it and it just slips through your fingers.

5344
03:33:44.440 --> 03:33:47.379
It falls and the whip recoils back.

5345
03:33:47.379 --> 03:33:48.943
MARISHA: I'm rolling shitty.

5346
03:33:48.943 --> 03:33:50.960
LIAM: We all have rolled shitty.

5347
03:33:50.960 --> 03:33:52.060
TALIESIN: Fjord, have you gone yet?

5348
03:33:52.060 --> 03:33:53.810
MARISHA: Fuck, that was--

5349
03:33:53.810 --> 03:33:54.720
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5350
03:33:54.720 --> 03:33:58.680
LAURA: Okay, as a bonus action.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5351
03:33:58.680 --> 03:34:03.680
LAURA: This is stupid but I'm going to bonus action

5352
03:34:03.690 --> 03:34:06.430
cast Mass Healing Word.

5353
03:34:06.430 --> 03:34:08.910
MATT: Okay, the range on that is--
LAURA: 60 feet.

5354
03:34:08.910 --> 03:34:12.010
MARISHA: Yes, you can hit pretty much everybody.

5355
03:34:12.010 --> 03:34:13.110
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Except for--

5356
03:34:13.110 --> 03:34:15.191
LAURA: Six creatures.
MATT: Except for Yasha.

5357
03:34:15.191 --> 03:34:16.720
LAURA: So...

5358
03:34:18.860 --> 03:34:21.530
Woo, you guys get six whole points.

5359
03:34:21.530 --> 03:34:24.280
MARISHA: That's definitely something.

5360
03:34:28.440 --> 03:34:30.106
TRAVIS: Yeah, what is it? What, sorry?

5361
03:34:30.106 --> 03:34:31.610
LAURA: Six points.
SAM: Oh my god.

5362
03:34:31.610 --> 03:34:35.798
This did not go the way I thought it was going to go.

5363
03:34:37.340 --> 03:34:38.173
Oh boy.

5364
03:34:39.097 --> 03:34:40.084
MATT: All right.

5365
03:34:40.084 --> 03:34:41.490
That finishes Jester's go?

5366
03:34:41.490 --> 03:34:43.090
LAURA: Damn it.

5367
03:34:43.090 --> 03:34:43.923
MATT: Nott, you're up.

5368
03:34:43.923 --> 03:34:44.900
LAURA: I really thought that was going to--

5369
03:34:44.900 --> 03:34:47.660
MATT: I know, it was so close.

5370
03:34:47.660 --> 03:34:49.010
TALIESIN: It was a good idea.

5371
03:34:49.010 --> 03:34:51.650
SAM: I've got the knife, right?

5372
03:34:51.650 --> 03:34:53.800
And I need to stick the knife in when it's time

5373
03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:55.410
to close the door or pull it out?

5374
03:34:55.410 --> 03:34:56.960
LAURA: You need to stick it in.

5375
03:34:56.960 --> 03:34:59.600
Oh no, pull it back out, that's right.

5376
03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:01.340
MATT: Yes, the dagger was placed back in

5377
03:35:01.340 --> 03:35:02.990
to let it re-open again.

5378
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:06.880
LAURA: But it's the Laughing Hand's turn after yours.

5379
03:35:06.880 --> 03:35:08.340
TALIESIN: So we have to start it closing now.

5380
03:35:08.340 --> 03:35:09.830
SAM: Well, I will hold my action.

5381
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:11.280
LAURA: No no no, you need to start it.

5382
03:35:11.280 --> 03:35:13.047
TALIESIN: Now.
MARISHA: Start it.

5383
03:35:13.047 --> 03:35:14.570
TALIESIN: Because it'll take an action to close.

5384
03:35:14.570 --> 03:35:15.640
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Start it.

5385
03:35:15.640 --> 03:35:17.600
And then Fjord and I can get out.

5386
03:35:17.600 --> 03:35:20.253
SAM: I will pull it out.

5387
03:35:20.253 --> 03:35:21.720
MATT: Okay.
SAM: I guess.

5388
03:35:21.720 --> 03:35:22.553
MATT: You pull the dagger out.

5389
03:35:22.553 --> 03:35:26.074
The doors, they were already re-closing,

5390
03:35:26.074 --> 03:35:28.140
you pull them out, they begin re-opening again.

5391
03:35:28.140 --> 03:35:29.490
So there's one round.

5392
03:35:29.490 --> 03:35:30.970
SAM: Other way.
MARISHA: Put it back in.

5393
03:35:30.970 --> 03:35:32.220
MATT: Yeah, sorry, sorry.

5394
03:35:32.220 --> 03:35:33.970
You put it in, and it began to open.

5395
03:35:33.970 --> 03:35:35.630
You pull it out and they're beginning to close once more.

5396
03:35:35.630 --> 03:35:36.463
Sorry.

5397
03:35:36.463 --> 03:35:37.440
You know what I mean.
SAM: Yes.

5398
03:35:37.440 --> 03:35:38.273
MATT: All right.

5399
03:35:38.273 --> 03:35:41.680
SAM: And bonus action, I will take out my Fluffernutter bomb

5400
03:35:41.680 --> 03:35:44.390
and just hold it out, ready.

5401
03:35:44.390 --> 03:35:45.223
MATT: You got it.

5402
03:35:45.223 --> 03:35:48.278
All right, that finishes your turn.

5403
03:35:49.860 --> 03:35:51.350
Jumping through the wall of fire,

5404
03:35:51.350 --> 03:35:56.140
this hulking, cloaked behemoth just leaps through.

5405
03:35:56.140 --> 03:35:59.900
Flames licking off of it, slowly burning away.

5406
03:35:59.900 --> 03:36:01.750
It's going to go ahead and run forward

5407
03:36:01.750 --> 03:36:06.652
and attempt to attack you, Beauregard.

5408
03:36:08.100 --> 03:36:11.330
MARISHA: That's okay.

5409
03:36:11.330 --> 03:36:14.780
MATT: It's going attempt to slam attack you to grab.

5410
03:36:14.780 --> 03:36:17.863
That is a 17.
MARISHA: Miss.

5411
03:36:17.863 --> 03:36:21.480
MATT: It's going to make its blade arm attack against you.

5412
03:36:21.480 --> 03:36:23.730
That is a 16.

5413
03:36:23.730 --> 03:36:26.180
LIAM: Yes, yes.

5414
03:36:26.180 --> 03:36:27.970
MATT: That's going to be a 20 to hit.

5415
03:36:27.970 --> 03:36:28.810
MARISHA: (grunts)

5416
03:36:28.810 --> 03:36:30.460
LIAM: Break dance, break dance, boof.

5417
03:36:30.460 --> 03:36:31.865
MARISHA: 20 hits.

5418
03:36:31.865 --> 03:36:33.180
MATT: You take 18 points of slashing damage.

5419
03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:35.253
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

5420
03:36:36.382 --> 03:36:39.170
I'm not grappled, though.

5421
03:36:39.170 --> 03:36:40.640
MATT: All righty.

5422
03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:42.570
That finishes its turn.

5423
03:36:42.570 --> 03:36:43.940
No other hounds are up.

5424
03:36:43.940 --> 03:36:45.950
It's looming towards you after blowing through the fire.

5425
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:48.730
It's now comes up, tries to grab, misses once,

5426
03:36:48.730 --> 03:36:51.360
then slams the blade once and it pierces

5427
03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:52.890
like the side of your chest and the pain

5428
03:36:52.890 --> 03:36:54.410
causes you to push off just enough

5429
03:36:54.410 --> 03:36:55.990
to keep it from hitting anything vital.

5430
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:58.280
But there's now blood pouring out of this open wound

5431
03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:01.180
that it slashed into your side.

5432
03:37:01.180 --> 03:37:03.110
That brings us to Fjord.

5433
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:06.500
TRAVIS: I am fucked up, but I will push off of Beau's back

5434
03:37:06.500 --> 03:37:08.430
and rush towards the door.

5435
03:37:08.430 --> 03:37:10.006
How far away am I?

5436
03:37:10.006 --> 03:37:12.010
MATT: Okay, you are now in melee

5437
03:37:12.010 --> 03:37:15.670
with the creature, with Laughing Hand.

5438
03:37:15.670 --> 03:37:18.400
You can use your action to disengage and move if you want to

5439
03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:21.060
but that would be all you can do this turn.

5440
03:37:21.060 --> 03:37:22.170
TRAVIS: Yes.

5441
03:37:22.170 --> 03:37:24.850
That's what, how far am I from the door?

5442
03:37:24.850 --> 03:37:27.450
MATT: At this point, you are about 20 feet.

5443
03:37:27.450 --> 03:37:31.530
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll disengage and run my busted ass.

5444
03:37:31.530 --> 03:37:35.340
MATT: With that, a ruined Fjord manages to just barely

5445
03:37:35.340 --> 03:37:37.950
make his way out of the range of the Laughing Hand

5446
03:37:37.950 --> 03:37:42.000
and run through the doorway.

5447
03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:43.742
That finishes your go.

5448
03:37:45.150 --> 03:37:48.400
Yasha. What's the range on the fire wall?

5449
03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:49.967
How hurt are you?

5450
03:37:53.080 --> 03:37:54.718
ASHLEY: I'm at 39.

5451
03:37:55.660 --> 03:37:57.870
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.
ASHLEY: I'm okay.

5452
03:37:57.870 --> 03:38:00.310
MATT: Then go ahead and dart over

5453
03:38:00.310 --> 03:38:03.910
and moving next to the Laughing Hand.

5454
03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:06.000
It's now the Laughing Hand, Beau is dodging

5455
03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:06.950
and going out of the way.

5456
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:09.210
Lets Fjord go, turns around, and you see Yasha

5457
03:38:09.210 --> 03:38:11.500
run through the flames, dual hands,

5458
03:38:11.500 --> 03:38:13.670
angry face, rushing right towards you.

5459
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:15.160
Make two attacks against Beau.

5460
03:38:15.160 --> 03:38:16.524
SAM: Super cool image.

5461
03:38:16.524 --> 03:38:17.357
MARISHA: That is.

5462
03:38:17.357 --> 03:38:19.270
LIAM: Running through the fire.
SAM: Yeah.

5463
03:38:20.575 --> 03:38:22.612
MARISHA: It's okay.

5464
03:38:22.612 --> 03:38:24.430
ASHLEY: With advantage?

5465
03:38:24.430 --> 03:38:25.280
MATT: Not advantage.

5466
03:38:25.280 --> 03:38:27.982
Actually no, Reckless yeah, advantage.

5467
03:38:31.640 --> 03:38:33.860
ASHLEY: 20 for the first hit.

5468
03:38:33.860 --> 03:38:34.710
MATT: Does 20 hit your Armor Class?

5469
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:35.660
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yes.

5470
03:38:35.660 --> 03:38:37.870
MATT: Roll damage for that first strike against Beauregard.

5471
03:38:40.375 --> 03:38:44.160
MARISHA: I have more tools to get out is what I'm saying.

5472
03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:47.020
ASHLEY: 17 points of damage.

5473
03:38:47.020 --> 03:38:48.400
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage to you.

5474
03:38:48.400 --> 03:38:49.600
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Go ahead and roll

5475
03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:52.058
a second attack with advantage.

5476
03:38:53.865 --> 03:38:55.230
LAURA: I'm going to throw up.
ASHLEY: Me too.

5477
03:38:55.230 --> 03:38:58.360
SAM: This is the grossest fight ever.

5478
03:38:58.360 --> 03:38:59.970
ASHLEY: 24.

5479
03:38:59.970 --> 03:39:03.300
MATT: 24, go ahead and roll damage again.

5480
03:39:07.018 --> 03:39:09.284
ASHLEY: Okay.

5481
03:39:10.860 --> 03:39:13.235
14 points of damage.

5482
03:39:14.390 --> 03:39:15.223
MATT: Still standing?

5483
03:39:15.223 --> 03:39:16.080
MARISHA: Yep.
MATT: All righty.

5484
03:39:16.080 --> 03:39:18.090
That finishes Yasha's turn.

5485
03:39:18.090 --> 03:39:20.330
Beau, Caleb, you're up.

5486
03:39:20.330 --> 03:39:23.450
LIAM: Iron shavings in the air, the flames drop

5487
03:39:23.450 --> 03:39:26.123
and Beauregard doubles in size.

5488
03:39:28.130 --> 03:39:29.580
MATT: Okay.

5489
03:39:29.580 --> 03:39:34.580
With that, the flames fall out of place and a massive

5490
03:39:34.880 --> 03:39:36.050
Beauregard now--
LAURA: She won't be able

5491
03:39:36.050 --> 03:39:37.230
to get through the door.

5492
03:39:38.230 --> 03:39:40.440
MATT: The door is ten feet wide.
LAURA: Okay.

5493
03:39:40.440 --> 03:39:43.080
MATT: Although it is closing.

5494
03:39:44.700 --> 03:39:45.690
MARISHA: But I'm fucking fast.

5495
03:39:45.690 --> 03:39:48.670
MATT: You are, this'll be an ability check to see--

5496
03:39:48.670 --> 03:39:49.880
MARISHA: All right.

5497
03:39:49.880 --> 03:39:50.713
MATT: All right.

5498
03:39:50.713 --> 03:39:53.180
So fast Beau is now, I'm going to move this back a bit

5499
03:39:53.180 --> 03:39:56.330
just so we get a little more spatial awareness here.

5500
03:39:56.330 --> 03:39:57.510
So.

5501
03:39:57.510 --> 03:39:58.840
SAM: Dwarven Forge.

5502
03:39:58.840 --> 03:40:00.990
MATT: I know, this is insane.

5503
03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:04.370
So Beauregard is right there.

5504
03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:07.910
Yasha is flanking on side there in the hallway.

5505
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:09.700
The rest of them are by the door.

5506
03:40:09.700 --> 03:40:11.560
I know, it's a big fight.

5507
03:40:11.560 --> 03:40:12.393
All right.

5508
03:40:12.393 --> 03:40:14.780
So Beauregard, you enlarge in size.

5509
03:40:14.780 --> 03:40:16.930
Yasha to your right, the Laughing Hand behind you

5510
03:40:16.930 --> 03:40:18.480
as you turn around, what are you doing?

5511
03:40:18.480 --> 03:40:22.890
MARISHA: I'm going to Step of the Wind to disengage.

5512
03:40:22.890 --> 03:40:25.420
MATT: Disengage, all right.

5513
03:40:25.420 --> 03:40:27.390
That nullifies the Sentinel.

5514
03:40:28.280 --> 03:40:29.113
SAM: Oh boy.

5515
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:34.320
MARISHA: And my jump distance is also doubled,

5516
03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:37.750
so I'm going to just kick off and try and like--

5517
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:39.740
MATT: It doesn't increase your speed any further,

5518
03:40:39.740 --> 03:40:42.710
but you can make it just a cool moment as you run and leap--

5519
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:44.960
MARISHA: And I'm going to turn to the side.

5520
03:40:44.960 --> 03:40:46.290
MATT: Make an acrobatics check for me

5521
03:40:46.290 --> 03:40:49.835
as you attempt to make your large form, tiny.

5522
03:40:53.437 --> 03:40:56.720
MARISHA: Oh, why?

5523
03:40:56.720 --> 03:40:57.920
11.

5524
03:40:57.920 --> 03:40:58.753
MATT: 11.

5525
03:40:59.850 --> 03:41:04.850
You squeeze past and are now pressed between the doors.

5526
03:41:05.604 --> 03:41:07.020
LIAM: Oh no.

5527
03:41:07.020 --> 03:41:08.340
MATT: They're starting to crush you.

5528
03:41:08.340 --> 03:41:09.453
MATT: Oh my god.

5529
03:41:09.453 --> 03:41:11.930
MARISHA: Do I still have the thing that I can do?

5530
03:41:11.930 --> 03:41:13.190
Can I have an action?

5531
03:41:13.190 --> 03:41:15.482
MATT: You do have an action still, yeah.

5532
03:41:16.823 --> 03:41:18.273
MARISHA: (struggling sounds)

5533
03:41:18.273 --> 03:41:19.760
MATT: Okay, yeah, you do still have an action.

5534
03:41:19.760 --> 03:41:21.050
Make an athletics or acrobatics check

5535
03:41:21.050 --> 03:41:23.160
to try and break away because you are currently restrained

5536
03:41:23.160 --> 03:41:25.527
and it's starting to crush you.

5537
03:41:26.840 --> 03:41:29.325
TALIESIN: Can you drop the spell as a reaction?

5538
03:41:29.325 --> 03:41:31.260
LIAM: Probably.

5539
03:41:31.260 --> 03:41:32.093
MARISHA: 18.

5540
03:41:32.093 --> 03:41:35.800
Wait, yes, nine plus eight, 17.

5541
03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:40.410
MATT: You just manage to squeeze through that last action

5542
03:41:40.410 --> 03:41:42.610
and push your way through into the chamber.

5543
03:41:42.610 --> 03:41:44.220
SAM: Are we all in except for Yasha?

5544
03:41:44.220 --> 03:41:46.110
MATT: Everyone is in except for Yasha.

5545
03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:50.620
All right, that brings us to Caduceus.

5546
03:41:53.641 --> 03:41:58.050
TALIESIN: I had my reaction still, so I'm just going to...

5547
03:41:58.050 --> 03:42:01.290
I held my spell.

5548
03:42:01.290 --> 03:42:04.283
So I'm just going to burn my spell.

5549
03:42:04.283 --> 03:42:05.460
I think you're pretty far down.

5550
03:42:05.460 --> 03:42:06.780
Who's, you're both pretty far down.

5551
03:42:06.780 --> 03:42:08.530
Who looks worse?

5552
03:42:08.530 --> 03:42:11.060
MATT: I don't know, probably, both pretty rough.

5553
03:42:11.060 --> 03:42:12.830
TRAVIS: I'm all fucked up.
MATT: Go for it.

5554
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:15.110
TALIESIN: Have a, oh my god, that's terrible.

5555
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:17.530
MATT: Three ones on 3d4?

5556
03:42:17.530 --> 03:42:20.000
TALIESIN: 12 hit points.
TRAVIS: I will take it.

5557
03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:21.740
That's more than I had.

5558
03:42:21.740 --> 03:42:23.900
TALIESIN: I'm booking full speed.

5559
03:42:23.900 --> 03:42:26.030
I mean, if we've got everybody.

5560
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:27.890
MATT: All right, Caduceus, Jester, it's your go.

5561
03:42:27.890 --> 03:42:31.170
The door's closing on Nott's turn.

5562
03:42:31.170 --> 03:42:32.210
MARISHA: Nott's through, right?

5563
03:42:32.210 --> 03:42:34.960
LAURA: Nott's through, everybody's through except for Yasha?

5564
03:42:38.210 --> 03:42:39.660
SAM: Give it a shot.

5565
03:42:40.530 --> 03:42:42.390
LAURA: Like try to whip her and bring her through?

5566
03:42:42.390 --> 03:42:44.140
SAM: Yeah, yeah, maybe she'll make it.

5567
03:42:45.530 --> 03:42:47.700
LAURA: I'm going to whip Yasha and try to bring her through.

5568
03:42:47.700 --> 03:42:50.320
I'm going to try to hit Yasha with the whip.

5569
03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:51.153
MATT: Okay.

5570
03:42:51.153 --> 03:42:52.670
TRAVIS: Now, she's heavier than you.

5571
03:42:53.700 --> 03:42:55.953
LAURA: It doesn't matter, it's a strength thing.

5572
03:42:55.953 --> 03:42:56.786
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack roll.

5573
03:42:56.786 --> 03:42:57.680
TRAVIS: It's not going to pull you towards her, right?

5574
03:42:57.680 --> 03:42:58.940
LAURA: No.

5575
03:42:58.940 --> 03:43:00.080
That's now how it works.

5576
03:43:00.080 --> 03:43:01.650
TALIESIN: Yasha that's going to kill all of us.

5577
03:43:01.650 --> 03:43:03.780
LAURA and MATT: Natural one.

5578
03:43:04.792 --> 03:43:07.000
SAM: (whip crack) (yells)

5579
03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:09.950
MATT: You go to whip, and as you swing back,

5580
03:43:09.950 --> 03:43:12.080
the actual end of the whip ends up wrapping

5581
03:43:12.080 --> 03:43:14.690
around Caduceus' leg as he's running the other way

5582
03:43:14.690 --> 03:43:19.030
and Caduceus you fall onto your stomach as it unravels.

5583
03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:20.160
You're fine, you're still in the chamber.

5584
03:43:20.160 --> 03:43:21.750
But the whip does not make its way out.

5585
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:24.090
TALIESIN: I go invisible just out of panic.

5586
03:43:24.090 --> 03:43:24.923
MATT: All right.

5587
03:43:24.923 --> 03:43:26.460
(laughter)

5588
03:43:26.460 --> 03:43:29.993
TRAVIS: Your other response, a small fart.

5589
03:43:29.993 --> 03:43:31.451
LAURA: I reach out to Yasha

5590
03:43:31.451 --> 03:43:34.630
and start sobbing as the door shuts.

5591
03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:37.080
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go, Nott.

5592
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:40.186
SAM: There's nothing I can do.

5593
03:43:40.186 --> 03:43:41.269
LAURA: (sobbing) Yasha!

5594
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:45.400
SAM: I'm just going to look at Yasha and reach out.

5595
03:43:48.020 --> 03:43:52.060
MATT: You hear (thudding, running footsteps)

5596
03:43:52.060 --> 03:43:53.512
LAURA: We have to run.

5597
03:43:53.512 --> 03:43:55.540
MATT: (slamming on door)
SAM: Oh, oh boy.

5598
03:43:55.540 --> 03:43:57.320
LIAM: Okay, go go go go go go.

5599
03:43:57.320 --> 03:43:58.220
MATT: Against the door.

5600
03:43:58.220 --> 03:44:00.060
SAM: We're going to book it as fast as we can.

5601
03:44:00.060 --> 03:44:01.784
MARISHA: What do we do? What do we do about Yasha?

5602
03:44:01.784 --> 03:44:04.250
MATT: You guys book it out of the chamber.

5603
03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:05.430
What are you doing?

5604
03:44:05.430 --> 03:44:07.610
TRAVIS: We try to like play the fucking drums and drop the--

5605
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:10.276
LAURA: I try to play the music to try to

5606
03:44:10.276 --> 03:44:11.930
shut the other gate, too.

5607
03:44:11.930 --> 03:44:12.920
MATT: Okay.

5608
03:44:12.920 --> 03:44:16.328
You go ahead and play the theme one more time.

5609
03:44:17.290 --> 03:44:19.390
The crystal barrier shuts.

5610
03:44:19.390 --> 03:44:20.690
And you still hear the muffled bangs

5611
03:44:20.690 --> 03:44:21.523
from the opposite side.

5612
03:44:21.523 --> 03:44:24.993
Boof, boof, boof.

5613
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:27.703
What are you guys doing?

5614
03:44:27.703 --> 03:44:29.020
LIAM: I don't think that that will stop it.

5615
03:44:29.020 --> 03:44:31.020
TALIESIN: No, we got to get the fuck outta here.

5616
03:44:31.020 --> 03:44:32.050
We got to go.

5617
03:44:32.050 --> 03:44:34.600
LAURA: Yasha's trapped in there.

5618
03:44:34.600 --> 03:44:36.050
TRAVIS: I tried to get Yasha out of there.

5619
03:44:36.050 --> 03:44:37.100
She didn't want to leave.

5620
03:44:37.100 --> 03:44:37.940
TALIESIN: We are moving.

5621
03:44:38.900 --> 03:44:39.733
LIAM: This is a walk and talk.

5622
03:44:39.733 --> 03:44:41.840
We are moving through the space.

5623
03:44:41.840 --> 03:44:42.673
TRAVIS: Yeah, we are walking--

5624
03:44:42.673 --> 03:44:44.810
MATT: All right, so you're moving through the mirror chamber

5625
03:44:44.810 --> 03:44:48.050
and you're now at the base of the long bridge.

5626
03:44:48.050 --> 03:44:49.894
LIAM: Oh.

5627
03:44:49.894 --> 03:44:52.770
TRAVIS: Oh, Christ, why?

5628
03:44:52.770 --> 03:44:54.600
MARISHA: Why did we come here?

5629
03:44:54.600 --> 03:44:56.220
LAURA: We just need to go, right?

5630
03:44:56.220 --> 03:44:57.350
We just need to go.

5631
03:44:57.350 --> 03:44:59.820
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5632
03:44:59.820 --> 03:45:00.653
LAURA: Just run.

5633
03:45:00.653 --> 03:45:02.310
LIAM: No, we need to tie ourselves together.

5634
03:45:02.310 --> 03:45:03.370
Rope together for this.

5635
03:45:03.370 --> 03:45:04.203
Come on, quickly.

5636
03:45:04.203 --> 03:45:05.036
TRAVIS: Agreed.

5637
03:45:05.036 --> 03:45:07.152
LAURA: Rope together.

5638
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:09.850
TRAVIS: Who has 50 feet of rope?

5639
03:45:09.850 --> 03:45:11.090
LIAM: I still have mine.

5640
03:45:11.090 --> 03:45:15.330
TRAVIS: Okay, good, mine one's all cut up.

5641
03:45:15.330 --> 03:45:17.960
LAURA: And then we just sprint across and try to--

5642
03:45:17.960 --> 03:45:20.130
TRAVIS: The really runny version.

5643
03:45:21.740 --> 03:45:23.390
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah, run for it?

5644
03:45:23.390 --> 03:45:25.010
TRAVIS: Yeah, not the slow one.

5645
03:45:25.010 --> 03:45:25.843
LIAM: Okay.

5646
03:45:25.843 --> 03:45:26.676
MATT: You guys going to run a full sprint.

5647
03:45:26.676 --> 03:45:28.790
Thankfully, you've fully banished the ropers.

5648
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:31.010
That's no longer a worry.

5649
03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:32.880
You guys all charge together across.

5650
03:45:32.880 --> 03:45:35.360
At full speed, double move, you can make it across

5651
03:45:35.360 --> 03:45:37.500
the whole bridge in about three to four rounds.

5652
03:45:37.500 --> 03:45:41.040
So as you're rushing across, the metal clanging,

5653
03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:43.110
the bridge swinging a bit, the chains rustling,

5654
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:44.370
you hear the whispers.

5655
03:45:44.370 --> 03:45:45.670
(creepy whispering)

5656
03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:46.503
Begin to build up.

5657
03:45:46.503 --> 03:45:47.800
MARISHA: Can I do like a la la la la la la la la?

5658
03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:48.633
MATT: You can certainly try.

5659
03:45:48.633 --> 03:45:49.960
Everyone make a wisdom saving throw.

5660
03:45:49.960 --> 03:45:50.926
TALIESIN: Right before we start doing

5661
03:45:50.926 --> 03:45:51.860
the wisdom saving throw,

5662
03:45:51.860 --> 03:45:55.418
I'm going to cast Bless on...

5663
03:45:57.576 --> 03:45:58.920
let's see--

5664
03:45:58.920 --> 03:45:59.753
LAURA: Me too.

5665
03:45:59.753 --> 03:46:00.586
TALIESIN: How many targets?

5666
03:46:00.586 --> 03:46:03.160
It's six people.

5667
03:46:03.160 --> 03:46:08.160
So I'm going to cast Bless on one, two, three, four, five,

5668
03:46:08.800 --> 03:46:11.383
I'm casting Bless on everybody.

5669
03:46:13.263 --> 03:46:14.260
MATT: Okay.

5670
03:46:14.260 --> 03:46:15.093
LAURA: Okay.

5671
03:46:16.543 --> 03:46:17.690
SAM: What is this, a wisdom save?

5672
03:46:17.690 --> 03:46:19.620
MATT: Wisdom saving throw.
SAM: Five.

5673
03:46:19.620 --> 03:46:20.870
MATT: Five, okay.

5674
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:21.970
TALIESIN: With the d4?

5675
03:46:21.970 --> 03:46:24.160
MARISHA: 19.
TRAVIS: 14.

5676
03:46:24.160 --> 03:46:25.735
LAURA: 15.

5677
03:46:27.020 --> 03:46:28.680
TALIESIN: Like 27.

5678
03:46:28.680 --> 03:46:29.803
MATT: Oh, you're not there, sorry.

5679
03:46:29.803 --> 03:46:31.320
ASHLEY: No!

5680
03:46:31.320 --> 03:46:33.169
MATT: I'm such an asshole, I'm so sorry.

5681
03:46:33.169 --> 03:46:34.767
(laughter)

5682
03:46:34.767 --> 03:46:36.400
ASHLEY: That was amazing.

5683
03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:37.330
MATT: All right.

5684
03:46:37.330 --> 03:46:38.163
ASHLEY: And you?

5685
03:46:38.163 --> 03:46:39.740
ASHLEY and MATT: Oh, you're not there.

5686
03:46:39.740 --> 03:46:42.100
MATT: I'm so sorry, that's purely accidental.

5687
03:46:42.100 --> 03:46:43.270
I'm the worst.

5688
03:46:43.270 --> 03:46:44.730
I'm the worst.

5689
03:46:44.730 --> 03:46:47.546
All right, so as you're rushing across the first leg of it,

5690
03:46:47.546 --> 03:46:49.721
Nott begins to--

5691
03:46:51.686 --> 03:46:55.138
Nott begins to run in a random direction.

5692
03:46:56.260 --> 03:46:58.393
Continues to run forward, hilariously enough.

5693
03:46:58.393 --> 03:47:01.101
SAM: Come on, you fuckers, let's go.

5694
03:47:01.101 --> 03:47:02.200
What are you waiting for?

5695
03:47:02.200 --> 03:47:03.290
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

5696
03:47:03.290 --> 03:47:04.730
MATT: Running to the middle part of the bridge.

5697
03:47:04.730 --> 03:47:07.270
Everyone make another wisdom saving throw, please.

5698
03:47:07.270 --> 03:47:09.095
TALIESIN: With the d4.

5699
03:47:09.095 --> 03:47:12.070
MARISHA: Oh my god, natural one.

5700
03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:13.745
On my Keyfish die.
TRAVIS: 22.

5701
03:47:13.745 --> 03:47:14.578
SAM: 14.

5702
03:47:14.578 --> 03:47:15.680
LIAM: 11.
LAURA: 25.

5703
03:47:15.680 --> 03:47:17.560
TALIESIN: 22.
MATT: All right.

5704
03:47:17.560 --> 03:47:18.393
You go catatonic.

5705
03:47:18.393 --> 03:47:20.290
You guys have to drag Beauregard with you.

5706
03:47:20.290 --> 03:47:23.480
The whole group means she only slows you down a little bit.

5707
03:47:23.480 --> 03:47:25.560
It'll add an additional round to getting across.

5708
03:47:25.560 --> 03:47:26.820
You're now on the third leg.

5709
03:47:26.820 --> 03:47:29.070
You're almost to three quarters the way across,

5710
03:47:29.070 --> 03:47:30.530
dragging Beau behind.

5711
03:47:30.530 --> 03:47:31.760
Go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw

5712
03:47:31.760 --> 03:47:33.510
because the whispers are getting louder and louder.

5713
03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:36.100
The noise you're making is calling the entire chasm

5714
03:47:36.100 --> 03:47:38.303
to rise up as the gibbering and the shouting and--

5715
03:47:38.303 --> 03:47:39.820
LIAM: Oh!
MARISHA: My god!

5716
03:47:39.820 --> 03:47:41.418
MATT: Again?
MARISHA: I rolled a two.

5717
03:47:41.418 --> 03:47:42.810
MATT: Oh god.
TRAVIS: 23.

5718
03:47:42.810 --> 03:47:44.070
MATT: All right, and you?
LIAM: 17.

5719
03:47:44.070 --> 03:47:45.280
SAM: 14.
LAURA: 22.

5720
03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:46.300
TALIESIN: 23.
MATT: All right.

5721
03:47:46.300 --> 03:47:49.775
Everyone's, once again, dragging Beauregard behind.

5722
03:47:50.661 --> 03:47:53.020
That gets you to the three quarter point of the bridge.

5723
03:47:53.020 --> 03:47:55.760
Another wisdom saving throw as she picks up the speed.

5724
03:47:55.760 --> 03:47:58.400
TRAVIS: Another one?
MATT: Yes.

5725
03:47:58.400 --> 03:48:00.180
MARISHA: Again?
TRAVIS: Wow!

5726
03:48:00.180 --> 03:48:01.860
Where was this shit before?
ASHLEY: Four plus d4.

5727
03:48:01.860 --> 03:48:04.720
MARISHA: Okay, so, okay.

5728
03:48:04.720 --> 03:48:07.150
MATT: Ten.
TRAVIS: 24.

5729
03:48:07.150 --> 03:48:08.690
SAM: 23.
LAURA: 15.

5730
03:48:08.690 --> 03:48:10.170
TALIESIN: 25.
MARISHA: 22.

5731
03:48:10.170 --> 03:48:12.060
MATT: Okay, this time Caleb.

5732
03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:15.975
Caleb, make a melee attack.

5733
03:48:15.975 --> 03:48:19.100
We'll say against--

5734
03:48:20.450 --> 03:48:23.440
against yourself, because why not?

5735
03:48:23.440 --> 03:48:26.010
LIAM: Natural 20.
(laughter)

5736
03:48:26.010 --> 03:48:27.960
MATT: You take two points of bludgeoning damage.

5737
03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:31.751
As you guys are running, Caleb keeps running and just goes,

5738
03:48:31.751 --> 03:48:34.284
whack, and just cold-cocks himself.

5739
03:48:34.284 --> 03:48:36.430
The nose is snapped to one side.

5740
03:48:36.430 --> 03:48:38.250
You can see his broken nose.

5741
03:48:38.250 --> 03:48:39.440
LIAM: You can't really tell.

5742
03:48:39.440 --> 03:48:41.590
MATT: (laughs)
MARISHA: Oh my god.

5743
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:44.060
LIAM: Am I the first person to crit myself on the show?

5744
03:48:44.060 --> 03:48:45.790
MATT: I think you might be.

5745
03:48:45.790 --> 03:48:46.750
SAM: Master debater.

5746
03:48:46.750 --> 03:48:49.240
TALIESIN: Ooh, self-crit, those are rare.

5747
03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:50.510
MATT: Towards the end of the chamber,

5748
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:51.410
you get to the edge of the bridge

5749
03:48:51.410 --> 03:48:53.090
and you're now on the opposite end of the chasm.

5750
03:48:53.090 --> 03:48:54.610
However, you're still on the precipice.

5751
03:48:54.610 --> 03:48:55.870
One more wisdom saving throw, everybody.

5752
03:48:55.870 --> 03:48:57.800
SAM: Oh, Jesus God.

5753
03:48:58.890 --> 03:49:00.570
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
MATT: Nice.

5754
03:49:00.570 --> 03:49:01.820
SAM: 18.
MATT: All right.

5755
03:49:01.820 --> 03:49:02.653
TALIESIN: 29.

5756
03:49:04.130 --> 03:49:05.983
MARISHA: 21 plus--
LIAM: Ten.

5757
03:49:05.983 --> 03:49:07.440
TRAVIS: Four.
MARISHA: 25.

5758
03:49:07.440 --> 03:49:08.730
LAURA: 23.
MATT: All righty.

5759
03:49:08.730 --> 03:49:10.720
Caleb, still dragging behind, you guys manage

5760
03:49:10.720 --> 03:49:14.280
to pull him out of the chamber as he tries to

5761
03:49:14.280 --> 03:49:16.200
run in the opposite direction and back into the room

5762
03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:18.460
and you drag him back in.

5763
03:49:18.460 --> 03:49:20.290
But you manage to pull your way and you're now back

5764
03:49:20.290 --> 03:49:24.470
into the chamber of the undead hearts that you gathered.

5765
03:49:24.470 --> 03:49:27.370
TRAVIS: Can we unhook the fucking bridge?

5766
03:49:27.370 --> 03:49:28.680
Like, can we--
SAM: What about Yasha?

5767
03:49:28.680 --> 03:49:31.160
What if she needs to get over?

5768
03:49:31.160 --> 03:49:32.980
What about Yasha?

5769
03:49:32.980 --> 03:49:34.180
LIAM: What about that thing?

5770
03:49:34.180 --> 03:49:37.020
What if it wants to come out of this place?

5771
03:49:37.020 --> 03:49:39.190
SAM: It can jump down and make it across

5772
03:49:39.190 --> 03:49:40.540
with or without a bridge.

5773
03:49:40.540 --> 03:49:42.820
TRAVIS: All right, all right.

5774
03:49:42.820 --> 03:49:44.245
Let's go.

5775
03:49:46.033 --> 03:49:48.100
SAM: Should we leave a note for her?

5776
03:49:48.100 --> 03:49:48.933
TALIESIN: We are moving.

5777
03:49:48.933 --> 03:49:51.360
LAURA: We're in with the zombies, y'all, we got to go.

5778
03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:52.320
MATT: You're into the room.

5779
03:49:52.320 --> 03:49:54.040
You rush in, the other door's open.

5780
03:49:54.040 --> 03:49:56.100
As you're running through, you can see like hands

5781
03:49:56.100 --> 03:49:58.040
scraping through the undead piles beneath

5782
03:49:58.040 --> 03:49:59.220
starting to drag their way up

5783
03:49:59.220 --> 03:50:02.630
from the subterranean undead cache.

5784
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:04.100
You guys continue to push through.

5785
03:50:04.100 --> 03:50:06.260
TRAVIS: Past all that shit.

5786
03:50:06.260 --> 03:50:08.020
MATT: Pushing on progressively, you make your way

5787
03:50:08.020 --> 03:50:09.960
through each of the individual chambers,

5788
03:50:09.960 --> 03:50:12.190
which you fought through back into the chamber

5789
03:50:12.190 --> 03:50:13.770
where the spiders were.

5790
03:50:13.770 --> 03:50:17.520
I mean, up the tower of where the creature you locked

5791
03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:19.450
in there is still there.

5792
03:50:19.450 --> 03:50:20.440
TALIESIN: Great.

5793
03:50:20.440 --> 03:50:21.870
MATT: However, the door is locked.

5794
03:50:21.870 --> 03:50:23.410
So you need to try and unlock it.

5795
03:50:23.410 --> 03:50:26.730
SAM: Oh, this was the door at the bottom of the spiral?

5796
03:50:26.730 --> 03:50:28.058
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5797
03:50:28.058 --> 03:50:28.891
SAM: So I have to unlock it.

5798
03:50:28.891 --> 03:50:32.270
Everyone hold their actions, right?

5799
03:50:32.270 --> 03:50:33.760
LAURA: I mean, the thing didn't attack us

5800
03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:34.930
as soon as we got into the room.

5801
03:50:34.930 --> 03:50:36.752
It's going to--
LIAM: Higher.

5802
03:50:36.752 --> 03:50:38.418
LAURA: At least the lightning thing is--
SAM: Was it the mist monster?

5803
03:50:38.418 --> 03:50:39.990
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's invisible.

5804
03:50:39.990 --> 03:50:41.980
SAM: Well, hold your actions anyway just in case.

5805
03:50:41.980 --> 03:50:42.900
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

5806
03:50:42.900 --> 03:50:45.430
SAM: I'm going to knock on the door super loud.

5807
03:50:45.430 --> 03:50:46.690
MATT: Doosh doosh doosh doosh.

5808
03:50:46.690 --> 03:50:47.523
Echoes through.

5809
03:50:47.523 --> 03:50:48.990
SAM: Wait a beat.

5810
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:50.790
Wait a few beats.

5811
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:52.350
Then I will pick the lock.

5812
03:50:52.350 --> 03:50:53.183
MATT: Okay.

5813
03:50:54.960 --> 03:50:56.030
SAM: 30.

5814
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:57.690
MATT: 30.

5815
03:50:57.690 --> 03:50:58.523
It opens up.

5816
03:50:58.523 --> 03:51:02.440
The mist wafts out in your direction.

5817
03:51:02.440 --> 03:51:03.480
Do you guys continue upward?

5818
03:51:03.480 --> 03:51:05.050
LAURA: Yeah, we got to.
MARISHA: Let's run.

5819
03:51:05.050 --> 03:51:06.980
MATT: All right, you guys run up, run up, run up.

5820
03:51:06.980 --> 03:51:08.280
As you're heading up that way, who's helming this?

5821
03:51:08.280 --> 03:51:10.590
Who's at the front?

5822
03:51:10.590 --> 03:51:11.460
LAURA: I'll helm.

5823
03:51:11.460 --> 03:51:13.170
MATT: All right so, Jester, as you're rushing up the side,

5824
03:51:13.170 --> 03:51:15.840
suddenly you see out of the mist, a face emerge--

5825
03:51:15.840 --> 03:51:16.673
LAURA: Guiding Bolt!

5826
03:51:16.673 --> 03:51:17.890
MATT: Everybody, go ahead and make...

5827
03:51:17.890 --> 03:51:20.670
Everyone who is within range, which you are not anymore,

5828
03:51:20.670 --> 03:51:22.260
unfortunately, you're further back.

5829
03:51:22.260 --> 03:51:23.120
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame.

5830
03:51:23.120 --> 03:51:25.100
MATT: Sacred Flame.

5831
03:51:25.100 --> 03:51:27.482
Natural one.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

5832
03:51:28.530 --> 03:51:30.840
LAURA: 16 to hit.
MATT: 16.

5833
03:51:30.840 --> 03:51:32.180
You have disadvantage on the attack roll

5834
03:51:32.180 --> 03:51:33.460
because it is invisible, technically.

5835
03:51:33.460 --> 03:51:34.360
So roll once more.

5836
03:51:35.300 --> 03:51:36.300
LAURA: Higher.
MATT: Higher?

5837
03:51:36.300 --> 03:51:38.130
Then yeah, that hits.

5838
03:51:38.130 --> 03:51:39.800
Holy shit.
MATT: That hits.

5839
03:51:39.800 --> 03:51:42.630
TALIESIN: So that's 23 radiant damage.

5840
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:43.890
MATT: 23, okay.

5841
03:51:43.890 --> 03:51:46.790
TALIESIN: I rolled two eights with plus five radiant.

5842
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:48.347
MATT: Oof.

5843
03:51:48.347 --> 03:51:49.420
All right.

5844
03:51:49.420 --> 03:51:51.430
It's already still damaged from the previous battle.

5845
03:51:51.430 --> 03:51:54.780
TRAVIS: 14 points of force damage.

5846
03:51:54.780 --> 03:51:55.910
MATT: All righty, what were you holding?

5847
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:58.350
LIAM: A Fire Bolt, I rolled 22 at disadvantage

5848
03:51:58.350 --> 03:51:59.920
and got 12 points of fire damage.

5849
03:51:59.920 --> 03:52:01.100
MATT: 12 points of fire damage, okay.

5850
03:52:01.100 --> 03:52:02.350
LAURA: Another ten points of radiant damage.

5851
03:52:02.350 --> 03:52:04.400
MATT: Another ten points of radiant damage.

5852
03:52:04.400 --> 03:52:05.940
Yeah, we'll say the burst of it as it emerges,

5853
03:52:05.940 --> 03:52:08.520
you guys all at once boof and just (shrieks)

5854
03:52:08.520 --> 03:52:11.000
dissipates based on the attacks that it already suffered

5855
03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:14.452
in the previous battle and it had not fully recovered yet.

5856
03:52:16.136 --> 03:52:17.900
Or you know what, no, because you guys took a long rest.

5857
03:52:17.900 --> 03:52:19.600
So it would have recovered.

5858
03:52:19.600 --> 03:52:21.510
No, you took a long rest, you did.

5859
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:24.807
So it's still there, so it's going to get its attacks.

5860
03:52:24.807 --> 03:52:27.280
That means it's going to go ahead and take two slam attacks

5861
03:52:27.280 --> 03:52:29.900
to the person right in front of it, which is Jester.

5862
03:52:29.900 --> 03:52:31.659
That is a 11 to hit.

5863
03:52:31.659 --> 03:52:33.510
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Oh, it's advantage actually.

5864
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:35.110
That is a 15 to hit.

5865
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:38.650
All right, second attack against you with advantage.

5866
03:52:38.650 --> 03:52:40.270
That is going to be a 22 to hit.

5867
03:52:40.270 --> 03:52:41.103
LAURA: That hits.

5868
03:52:41.103 --> 03:52:41.936
MATT: All right.

5869
03:52:41.936 --> 03:52:44.300
As it slams you with its invisible pseudopod,

5870
03:52:44.300 --> 03:52:48.490
you suffer, two ones, you suffer five points

5871
03:52:48.490 --> 03:52:49.323
of bludgeoning damage.

5872
03:52:49.323 --> 03:52:50.971
LAURA: Okay.

5873
03:52:50.971 --> 03:52:52.230
MATT: I was rolling really well during the heart battle

5874
03:52:52.230 --> 03:52:54.251
and then--
LAURA: I'm going to use Hellish Rebuke.

5875
03:52:54.251 --> 03:52:56.200
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll damage on it.

5876
03:52:56.200 --> 03:52:58.690
TRAVIS: Now I'm pissed.

5877
03:52:58.690 --> 03:53:03.274
MATT: That gives it a, this is dexterity?

5878
03:53:03.274 --> 03:53:05.099
LAURA: Let me look.

5879
03:53:07.090 --> 03:53:08.040
MATT: Or is it constitution for it?

5880
03:53:08.040 --> 03:53:10.350
I think it's dexterity, right?
LAURA: Dexterity.

5881
03:53:10.350 --> 03:53:11.183
MATT: Yeah, okay.

5882
03:53:11.183 --> 03:53:12.280
So it's a 16, what's your DC?
LAURA: Oh, that saves.

5883
03:53:12.280 --> 03:53:15.947
MATT: Saves, okay. So it takes half damage.

5884
03:53:15.947 --> 03:53:18.920
LAURA: 17, 19 points.

5885
03:53:18.920 --> 03:53:21.410
MATT: All right, so it takes nine points of damage.

5886
03:53:21.410 --> 03:53:22.520
Got it.

5887
03:53:22.520 --> 03:53:24.010
All righty.

5888
03:53:24.010 --> 03:53:26.710
Do you guys continue to rush up alongside

5889
03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:28.340
or do you stand your ground and fight it?

5890
03:53:28.340 --> 03:53:29.680
LAURA: No, keep going.

5891
03:53:29.680 --> 03:53:30.513
MATT: You keep rushing.

5892
03:53:30.513 --> 03:53:32.160
It'll take an attack of opportunity against you, Jester,

5893
03:53:32.160 --> 03:53:33.930
as you rush past.

5894
03:53:33.930 --> 03:53:35.820
That's going to be a 25 to hit.

5895
03:53:35.820 --> 03:53:36.653
LAURA: Okay.

5896
03:53:36.653 --> 03:53:39.640
MATT: You suffer, that's better,

5897
03:53:39.640 --> 03:53:41.370
ten points of bludgeoning damage.

5898
03:53:41.370 --> 03:53:42.203
LAURA: Okay.

5899
03:53:42.203 --> 03:53:43.036
MATT: You guys all take your round now

5900
03:53:43.036 --> 03:53:44.450
as you see it attacking Jester

5901
03:53:44.450 --> 03:53:46.610
as you rush past, you can see it like swirling in the mist.

5902
03:53:46.610 --> 03:53:48.130
MARISHA: Can we punch as we run by?

5903
03:53:48.130 --> 03:53:50.610
MATT: I'll allow you.
TRAVIS: 16?

5904
03:53:50.610 --> 03:53:53.344
MATT: 16 hits. Everybody has disadvantage against it.

5905
03:53:53.344 --> 03:53:54.732
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame.

5906
03:53:54.732 --> 03:53:56.917
MATT: Sacred Flame.
SAM: 18 to hit.

5907
03:53:56.917 --> 03:53:58.613
MATT: Natural 17 succeeds.

5908
03:53:58.613 --> 03:54:02.160
TALIESIN: 24.

5909
03:54:02.160 --> 03:54:04.510
MARISHA: 12 for one.
MATT: 12 misses.

5910
03:54:04.510 --> 03:54:07.210
MARISHA: Second attack.
LAURA: 18 on the Guiding Bolt.

5911
03:54:07.210 --> 03:54:08.090
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

5912
03:54:08.090 --> 03:54:09.460
LIAM: 13.
MATT: Misses.

5913
03:54:09.460 --> 03:54:11.040
MARISHA: 18?
MATT: Hits.

5914
03:54:11.040 --> 03:54:13.190
SAM: 18 to hit for ten points of damage.

5915
03:54:13.190 --> 03:54:16.790
LAURA: 21 points of radiant damage.
MATT: Nice.

5916
03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:19.850
TRAVIS: 24 points of force damage
from the two Eldritch Blasts.

5917
03:54:19.850 --> 03:54:22.675
MARISHA: 12 points of bludgeoning damage from my fists.

5918
03:54:22.675 --> 03:54:24.140
MATT: Beau gets the final hit, whack,

5919
03:54:24.140 --> 03:54:26.630
and now it dissipates into the mist.

5920
03:54:26.630 --> 03:54:28.630
MARISHA: Fucking ghosts.

5921
03:54:29.730 --> 03:54:31.400
MATT: With that, you rush the rest of the way up the tower.

5922
03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:35.072
Thankfully, the device previously there has been disabled.

5923
03:54:35.072 --> 03:54:37.800
That would have made it a very difficult ascent.

5924
03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:39.780
You make your way through the spiderling chamber.

5925
03:54:39.780 --> 03:54:43.500
SAM: Before we leave, should we blow this thing up

5926
03:54:43.500 --> 03:54:44.810
so it can't get up the stairs?

5927
03:54:44.810 --> 03:54:46.650
Should we blow up the stairs or anything?

5928
03:54:46.650 --> 03:54:48.325
LIAM: The stairs.

5929
03:54:48.325 --> 03:54:51.268
SAM: I don't know, it can still climb probably.

5930
03:54:51.268 --> 03:54:52.430
LAURA: Yeah.

5931
03:54:52.430 --> 03:54:54.240
SAM: Or blow in a door, blow in a hallway.

5932
03:54:54.240 --> 03:54:55.972
TRAVIS: The bridge would've been the smarter one.

5933
03:54:55.972 --> 03:54:58.760
SAM: It can get across the fucking bridge.

5934
03:54:58.760 --> 03:55:01.650
TALIESIN: You're making, that's assumptions, it's--

5935
03:55:01.650 --> 03:55:04.670
SAM: We saw it jump 20 feet up in the air.

5936
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:06.080
Like it could jump down, jump up.

5937
03:55:06.080 --> 03:55:07.740
TRAVIS: It was hundreds of feet.

5938
03:55:07.740 --> 03:55:08.760
SAM: No, it wasn't.

5939
03:55:08.760 --> 03:55:10.290
TRAVIS: No, I mean the cavern.

5940
03:55:10.290 --> 03:55:11.840
LAURA: Yeah, but it can cross it.

5941
03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:12.870
It's also got the same--

5942
03:55:12.870 --> 03:55:14.520
TRAVIS: On the bottom where the big gibberer thing is?

5943
03:55:14.520 --> 03:55:15.710
LAURA: That's the same thing it is, too.

5944
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:19.450
TALIESIN: It hardly matters now, to be fair.

5945
03:55:19.450 --> 03:55:21.440
I mean, if we have something to blow this thing up with,

5946
03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:22.273
it's great.

5947
03:55:22.273 --> 03:55:23.410
But if not, we should just run.

5948
03:55:23.410 --> 03:55:24.690
TRAVIS: Yeah, the tower.

5949
03:55:24.690 --> 03:55:25.523
TALIESIN: I got nothing.

5950
03:55:25.523 --> 03:55:27.770
I'm close to tapped.
SAM: I have a bomb.

5951
03:55:27.770 --> 03:55:29.240
I don't know if it'll blow everything up, though.

5952
03:55:29.240 --> 03:55:32.482
TRAVIS: I don't either, but it's your bomb.

5953
03:55:33.620 --> 03:55:35.880
SAM: Let's just keep going.
TRAVIS: You decide.

5954
03:55:35.880 --> 03:55:37.310
SAM: Let's keep going, it probably won't work.

5955
03:55:37.310 --> 03:55:38.420
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

5956
03:55:38.420 --> 03:55:41.980
You guys rush through the spiderling chamber.

5957
03:55:41.980 --> 03:55:44.860
Glide underneath the partially opened adamantine door.

5958
03:55:44.860 --> 03:55:46.980
Make your way to the courtyard where the angels

5959
03:55:46.980 --> 03:55:49.680
still remain, eyes bleeding.

5960
03:55:49.680 --> 03:55:51.230
You head back into the winding tunnels,

5961
03:55:51.230 --> 03:55:54.110
past the obelisk, pushing into the darkness

5962
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:55.490
until eventually you make your way

5963
03:55:55.490 --> 03:55:57.810
stumbling out of the hidden passageway,

5964
03:55:57.810 --> 03:56:02.450
back into the dusty mid-afternoon near Bazzoxan

5965
03:56:02.450 --> 03:56:06.638
on the north side of Xhorhas and the Barbed Fields.

5966
03:56:08.490 --> 03:56:10.490
LAURA: I pull the symbol.

5967
03:56:10.490 --> 03:56:12.040
MATT: You pull the thing out?

5968
03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:14.260
LAURA: Symbol out of the thing to try to close the door

5969
03:56:14.260 --> 03:56:15.250
on the hidden passageway.

5970
03:56:15.250 --> 03:56:19.170
MATT: Okay, it closes.

5971
03:56:19.170 --> 03:56:21.520
TALIESIN: Find our mounts.
TRAVIS: What did we do?

5972
03:56:21.520 --> 03:56:23.420
Why did we do that?

5973
03:56:23.420 --> 03:56:25.703
MARISHA: Yasha made her choice.

5974
03:56:26.950 --> 03:56:27.880
She said so herself.

5975
03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:29.570
TALIESIN: We need to find somewhere to hide.

5976
03:56:30.560 --> 03:56:31.740
We're not safe here.

5977
03:56:31.740 --> 03:56:33.450
TRAVIS: We're going to leave, but can we set something

5978
03:56:33.450 --> 03:56:35.510
so that we at least know if it makes its way

5979
03:56:35.510 --> 03:56:38.280
out of the door, not that we could warn anybody, but...

5980
03:56:39.170 --> 03:56:41.230
TALIESIN: I think it's going to make its way out.

5981
03:56:41.230 --> 03:56:42.490
LIAM: Just to remind,

5982
03:56:42.490 --> 03:56:44.910
we're at this like military outpost, right?

5983
03:56:44.910 --> 03:56:46.960
Isn't it like right in the heart of--

5984
03:56:46.960 --> 03:56:48.230
LAURA: We're not there.

5985
03:56:48.230 --> 03:56:49.120
LIAM: We traveled away.

5986
03:56:49.120 --> 03:56:51.990
MATT: You guys are a few miles off to the western side.

5987
03:56:51.990 --> 03:56:53.400
TALIESIN: We need to get on our mounts and head back.

5988
03:56:53.400 --> 03:56:57.690
TRAVIS: We literally did this guy's job for him.

5989
03:56:57.690 --> 03:57:00.332
LIAM: And he's paste.

5990
03:57:00.332 --> 03:57:03.860
We came away from this with nothing.

5991
03:57:03.860 --> 03:57:05.310
Less than nothing.

5992
03:57:05.310 --> 03:57:08.018
TALIESIN: We've got to move.

5993
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:13.302
SAM: We have to tell the Bright Queen.

5994
03:57:13.302 --> 03:57:14.777
TALIESIN: We have to tell everybody

5995
03:57:14.777 --> 03:57:15.993
and we can't tell anybody.

5996
03:57:15.993 --> 03:57:18.450
LIAM: I pull out the silver thread and I start taking

5997
03:57:18.450 --> 03:57:23.280
the ten minutes I need to cast Alarm on this door.

5998
03:57:23.280 --> 03:57:24.113
MATT: Okay.

5999
03:57:24.113 --> 03:57:24.946
TALIESIN: I'm listening for any...

6000
03:57:24.946 --> 03:57:27.010
Can we hear the rumblings coming?

6001
03:57:27.010 --> 03:57:29.553
MATT: Make a perception check.

6002
03:57:29.553 --> 03:57:31.640
TALIESIN: Pick a d20, they all suck today.

6003
03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:32.750
Ah, 20.

6004
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:33.750
MATT: 20.

6005
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:35.530
You listen, nothing.

6006
03:57:35.530 --> 03:57:38.260
I mean, you traveled quite a distance below ground

6007
03:57:38.260 --> 03:57:39.260
to even reach there.

6008
03:57:39.260 --> 03:57:41.370
There's so much rock and earth between you

6009
03:57:41.370 --> 03:57:43.320
and where any of this is happening.

6010
03:57:43.320 --> 03:57:44.970
It would be a miracle to hear anything.

6011
03:57:44.970 --> 03:57:46.490
TALIESIN: I'm going to start wrangling up the--

6012
03:57:46.490 --> 03:57:48.157
TRAVIS: When I looked into Yasha's eyes,

6013
03:57:48.157 --> 03:57:51.310
she smiled when I said we had to get out of there.

6014
03:57:51.310 --> 03:57:52.840
She said she didn't know who she was,

6015
03:57:52.840 --> 03:57:55.100
couldn't remember things.

6016
03:57:55.100 --> 03:57:57.220
We don't know her at all.

6017
03:57:57.220 --> 03:58:00.950
What if that's who she was the whole time?

6018
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:02.340
LAURA: We know her.

6019
03:58:02.340 --> 03:58:03.180
TRAVIS: Do we?

6020
03:58:03.180 --> 03:58:04.340
LAURA: Yes.

6021
03:58:04.340 --> 03:58:06.840
TRAVIS: He called her a name. He recognized her,

6022
03:58:06.840 --> 03:58:08.680
and then she turned in the middle of all that.

6023
03:58:08.680 --> 03:58:10.800
That was a different person.

6024
03:58:10.800 --> 03:58:13.982
LAURA: She was mind-controlled like Caleb was.

6025
03:58:13.982 --> 03:58:16.930
Those things happen.

6026
03:58:16.930 --> 03:58:18.210
MARISHA: I have a feeling it's not

6027
03:58:18.210 --> 03:58:21.200
the last time we're going to see her.

6028
03:58:21.200 --> 03:58:25.840
They have been opening portals to other dimensions.

6029
03:58:25.840 --> 03:58:28.490
TALIESIN: We're going to save her, just not today.

6030
03:58:28.490 --> 03:58:29.590
LAURA: We have to save her.

6031
03:58:30.740 --> 03:58:35.740
MARISHA: Well, we took down one demon who is ripping portals

6032
03:58:37.990 --> 03:58:41.290
from the Abyss into this plane.

6033
03:58:41.290 --> 03:58:43.590
He's probably not the only one.

6034
03:58:45.600 --> 03:58:47.850
LIAM: Yeah, but what are we going to do?

6035
03:58:47.850 --> 03:58:51.190
Go back to the Bright Queen and tell her what?

6036
03:58:51.190 --> 03:58:52.023
We have nothing.

6037
03:58:52.023 --> 03:58:53.600
We don't have our friend.

6038
03:58:53.600 --> 03:58:55.880
We don't have this Obann.

6039
03:58:55.880 --> 03:58:57.005
We have nothing.

6040
03:58:57.005 --> 03:58:58.790
TRAVIS: We certainly can't tell her what we did.

6041
03:58:58.790 --> 03:59:00.020
TALIESIN: We can tell her what happened.

6042
03:59:00.020 --> 03:59:01.140
SAM: We have to.

6043
03:59:01.140 --> 03:59:02.990
TRAVIS: That what, we unleashed what?

6044
03:59:02.990 --> 03:59:05.500
LAURA: We didn't unleash it.
SAM: They have to know.

6045
03:59:05.500 --> 03:59:07.180
MARISHA: If anything--
LAURA: We tried to stop it.

6046
03:59:07.180 --> 03:59:08.920
MARISHA: It's stopped for now.

6047
03:59:08.920 --> 03:59:10.870
TALIESIN: This is what's happening.

6048
03:59:10.870 --> 03:59:11.703
We have to stop this.

6049
03:59:11.703 --> 03:59:13.380
TRAVIS: You're going to give away all of our good favor

6050
03:59:13.380 --> 03:59:14.740
in this Dynasty that we're in.

6051
03:59:14.740 --> 03:59:17.680
We are not going to be people of favor anymore.

6052
03:59:17.680 --> 03:59:19.560
That symbol will mean nothing.

6053
03:59:19.560 --> 03:59:20.726
SAM: We can tell the truth.

6054
03:59:20.726 --> 03:59:23.710
We killed the one that we set out to,

6055
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:27.082
but he unleashed this thing.

6056
03:59:28.300 --> 03:59:30.860
LIAM: How do we confirm that?

6057
03:59:30.860 --> 03:59:32.780
MARISHA: It's locked away.

6058
03:59:32.780 --> 03:59:33.850
There were several layers

6059
03:59:33.850 --> 03:59:36.020
of celestial magic in between that thing.

6060
03:59:36.020 --> 03:59:37.770
LAURA: And all of them are opened.

6061
03:59:37.770 --> 03:59:39.160
TALIESIN: And all of them were to keep people out,

6062
03:59:39.160 --> 03:59:41.953
not to keep that in.

6063
03:59:43.460 --> 03:59:44.720
We've got to go.

6064
03:59:44.720 --> 03:59:46.780
SAM: Let's just go, we'll talk on the way.

6065
03:59:46.780 --> 03:59:50.190
TALIESIN: I'm trying to collect the mounts.

6066
03:59:52.652 --> 03:59:55.940
LIAM: If this is a threat here maybe,

6067
03:59:55.940 --> 03:59:57.890
Jester, after you have rested, you can,

6068
03:59:59.820 --> 04:00:04.770
I need to think, but maybe, maybe you can contact Rosohna

6069
04:00:04.770 --> 04:00:05.730
and have them come here.

6070
04:00:05.730 --> 04:00:09.810
At least we'll warn them that there is a danger here.

6071
04:00:09.810 --> 04:00:11.820
What is the angle here?

6072
04:00:13.190 --> 04:00:15.750
LAURA: What was his name?

6073
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:16.583
TRAVIS: Obann?

6074
04:00:16.583 --> 04:00:19.090
LAURA: No, the guy, we released, the Laughing--

6075
04:00:19.090 --> 04:00:20.440
SAM: Torog.

6076
04:00:20.440 --> 04:00:22.950
MARISHA: Torog is the name of the Crawling King.

6077
04:00:22.950 --> 04:00:25.000
LAURA: He was a champion of the Crawling King.

6078
04:00:26.000 --> 04:00:26.920
TALIESIN: We have to let them know.

6079
04:00:26.920 --> 04:00:28.420
We have to let everybody know.

6080
04:00:29.500 --> 04:00:30.333
Everyone.

6081
04:00:30.333 --> 04:00:31.890
This is too big.

6082
04:00:31.890 --> 04:00:33.860
TRAVIS: We're going to go to jail.

6083
04:00:33.860 --> 04:00:34.693
TALIESIN: We're...

6084
04:00:34.693 --> 04:00:37.376
going to be lucky if there's a jail to go to.

6085
04:00:38.860 --> 04:00:40.200
This is bigger than that now.

6086
04:00:40.200 --> 04:00:42.308
This is bigger than jail.

6087
04:00:43.960 --> 04:00:46.140
This is the only way we're going to save our friend.

6088
04:00:46.140 --> 04:00:47.400
We got to move.

6089
04:00:47.400 --> 04:00:50.910
MARISHA: We're also still not 100% certain if the Dynasty

6090
04:00:50.910 --> 04:00:55.910
or the Empire have anything to do with these portals

6091
04:00:55.940 --> 04:00:58.280
or with Obann.

6092
04:00:58.280 --> 04:01:01.030
TALIESIN: Honestly, I think everybody needs
to be informed now.

6093
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:04.860
LIAM: We're just guessing. We don't know what's going on.

6094
04:01:04.860 --> 04:01:06.350
LAURA: We have to get out of here.

6095
04:01:06.350 --> 04:01:08.027
SAM: Let's go, let's just go back to the city.

6096
04:01:08.027 --> 04:01:09.960
TALIESIN: We can have this conversation later.

6097
04:01:09.960 --> 04:01:12.168
TRAVIS: All right, let's go.

6098
04:01:13.940 --> 04:01:17.370
MATT: It takes you a little bit to find your moorbounders.

6099
04:01:17.370 --> 04:01:18.880
They've wandered quite a bit

6100
04:01:18.880 --> 04:01:21.430
in the time that you've been gone.

6101
04:01:21.430 --> 04:01:23.860
They're a little dusty and unhappy.

6102
04:01:23.860 --> 04:01:26.110
And they've hunted in your absence,

6103
04:01:26.110 --> 04:01:30.357
but they're okay and happy to see you as you arrive.

6104
04:01:30.357 --> 04:01:32.430
You step aboard your moorbounders

6105
04:01:32.430 --> 04:01:35.090
and begin making your way back towards the Hallowed Road.

6106
04:01:35.090 --> 04:01:36.794
TRAVIS: Hey, Jester.

6107
04:01:36.794 --> 04:01:37.627
LAURA: What?

6108
04:01:37.627 --> 04:01:41.180
TRAVIS: Can you do that thing where you talk to people?

6109
04:01:41.180 --> 04:01:44.103
LAURA: Not today.

6110
04:01:44.103 --> 04:01:45.360
I don't have it today.

6111
04:01:45.360 --> 04:01:46.930
MARISHA: What do you need?

6112
04:01:46.930 --> 04:01:49.247
LAURA: I want to talk to Yasha.

6113
04:01:49.247 --> 04:01:50.912
More than anything.

6114
04:01:50.912 --> 04:01:53.002
MARISHA: What are you thinking?

6115
04:01:54.390 --> 04:01:56.535
TRAVIS: I just want to know what happened.

6116
04:01:56.535 --> 04:01:58.330
I want to know if it's her.

6117
04:01:58.330 --> 04:02:00.500
We've been played the whole time.

6118
04:02:00.500 --> 04:02:01.920
How stupid are we?

6119
04:02:01.920 --> 04:02:03.480
LAURA: It wasn't.

6120
04:02:03.480 --> 04:02:04.313
We talked to her.

6121
04:02:04.313 --> 04:02:07.170
We talked to her in her quietest moments.

6122
04:02:07.170 --> 04:02:11.123
That wasn't her.

6123
04:02:11.123 --> 04:02:12.840
LIAM: Yeah, we're a bunch of fast-talkers

6124
04:02:12.840 --> 04:02:15.170
and where did it get us?

6125
04:02:16.310 --> 04:02:17.701
Here.

6126
04:02:19.000 --> 04:02:22.003
MARISHA: I don't think this was all for nothing.

6127
04:02:26.580 --> 04:02:28.538
I know it feels shitty.

6128
04:02:31.226 --> 04:02:35.422
I feel closer though, I don't know why.

6129
04:02:35.422 --> 04:02:37.172
TALIESIN: Me too.

6130
04:02:39.140 --> 04:02:41.070
No one's stupid.

6131
04:02:43.060 --> 04:02:44.768
Look at us.

6132
04:02:45.800 --> 04:02:47.110
I mean, any one of us could have turned in there

6133
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:49.220
and we'd all be saying I told you so.

6134
04:02:49.220 --> 04:02:51.660
No one's stupid.

6135
04:02:51.660 --> 04:02:54.000
MARISHA: I mean, we said 80 times that we knew

6136
04:02:54.000 --> 04:02:56.650
we were walking into a trap and that we knew

6137
04:02:56.650 --> 04:02:59.680
that this guy wanted Yasha.

6138
04:02:59.680 --> 04:03:03.375
And she said, "I want to go first."

6139
04:03:04.520 --> 04:03:07.720
We said get in the middle, protect you.

6140
04:03:07.720 --> 04:03:10.120
She wanted to go first.

6141
04:03:10.120 --> 04:03:13.028
We wouldn't have been able to stop that.

6142
04:03:13.028 --> 04:03:17.470
And I'm not saying that that's any judgment on her

6143
04:03:17.470 --> 04:03:20.545
or that she knew what she was getting into.

6144
04:03:22.450 --> 04:03:23.720
But there's no sense in thinking

6145
04:03:23.720 --> 04:03:26.478
that we could've changed her fucking mind.

6146
04:03:27.864 --> 04:03:30.245
TALIESIN: I think we were going to get played
no matter what.

6147
04:03:31.570 --> 04:03:34.230
MARISHA: And we all knew that, right?

6148
04:03:34.230 --> 04:03:37.708
SAM: Yeah. We had to go in there.

6149
04:03:39.410 --> 04:03:40.280
LAURA: Yeah.

6150
04:03:40.280 --> 04:03:41.113
TRAVIS: I guess.

6151
04:03:41.113 --> 04:03:43.390
MARISHA: I mean, none of us are fucking dead.

6152
04:03:43.390 --> 04:03:44.223
TALIESIN: We got our answers,

6153
04:03:44.223 --> 04:03:46.060
we just didn't like 'em, that's all.

6154
04:03:46.060 --> 04:03:47.751
MARISHA: Exactly.

6155
04:03:51.465 --> 04:03:53.555
TALIESIN: I'm very tired.

6156
04:03:53.555 --> 04:03:56.280
TRAVIS: I thought we were going to change something, though.

6157
04:03:56.280 --> 04:03:59.770
Walking out minus one, empty-handed.

6158
04:03:59.770 --> 04:04:03.210
Can't even count it as a win except that we're alive.

6159
04:04:03.210 --> 04:04:05.370
TALIESIN: We have names.

6160
04:04:05.370 --> 04:04:07.570
Names are a lot.

6161
04:04:07.570 --> 04:04:10.050
Names can be so much.

6162
04:04:10.050 --> 04:04:12.820
LIAM: We don't really know what we have unleashed.

6163
04:04:12.820 --> 04:04:14.430
SAM: We don't, we don't know anything,

6164
04:04:14.430 --> 04:04:19.030
and we're not going to find answers out here in the sand.

6165
04:04:19.030 --> 04:04:23.310
We have to talk to people who know more than us.

6166
04:04:23.310 --> 04:04:25.518
TALIESIN: We're going to know.

6167
04:04:26.580 --> 04:04:29.042
We don't know yet, but we're going to know.

6168
04:04:30.920 --> 04:04:34.012
LAURA: Who are the people that locked away Torog?

6169
04:04:36.010 --> 04:04:38.280
MARISHA: Celestials.

6170
04:04:38.280 --> 04:04:40.220
Angels.

6171
04:04:40.220 --> 04:04:41.740
800 years ago.

6172
04:04:41.740 --> 04:04:43.370
LIAM: Moonweaver and--

6173
04:04:43.370 --> 04:04:46.680
MATT: Moonweaver and the Allhammer.

6174
04:04:46.680 --> 04:04:51.510
LAURA: Maybe we can research something, I don't know.

6175
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:53.180
TALIESIN: The Kiln.

6176
04:04:53.180 --> 04:04:54.149
MARISHA: Hmm?

6177
04:04:54.149 --> 04:04:55.410
TALIESIN: We need to go to the Kiln.

6178
04:04:55.410 --> 04:04:58.010
SAM: The Kiln, what's that?

6179
04:04:58.010 --> 04:05:02.563
MARISHA: His thing he's looking for.

6180
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:05.740
TALIESIN: It's another temple.

6181
04:05:05.740 --> 04:05:06.770
SAM: The what?

6182
04:05:06.770 --> 04:05:07.603
TALIESIN: The Kiln.

6183
04:05:09.627 --> 04:05:11.740
It's in the mountains near here.

6184
04:05:11.740 --> 04:05:15.125
MARISHA: Does it have something to do with the Allhammer?

6185
04:05:15.125 --> 04:05:17.690
Who was like forged some something, what did you,

6186
04:05:17.690 --> 04:05:18.810
you told us this.

6187
04:05:18.810 --> 04:05:20.685
TALIESIN: It's another temple to the Wildmother,

6188
04:05:20.685 --> 04:05:23.651
but it was a gift.

6189
04:05:26.238 --> 04:05:28.430
It was a gift to the Allhammer.

6190
04:05:28.430 --> 04:05:29.640
MARISHA: Right.

6191
04:05:29.640 --> 04:05:33.580
TALIESIN: We're all, all of us are gifts.

6192
04:05:33.580 --> 04:05:37.660
TRAVIS: Is it something that can help in this situation?

6193
04:05:37.660 --> 04:05:40.868
TALIESIN: It's where she's been pushing me.

6194
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:45.450
TRAVIS: I'll say it one last time.

6195
04:05:45.450 --> 04:05:47.440
I would rather go back to the Bright Queen

6196
04:05:47.440 --> 04:05:49.370
or whoever it is we think we're talking to

6197
04:05:49.370 --> 04:05:52.300
with a solution instead of just the problem.

6198
04:05:52.300 --> 04:05:54.120
Problems get locked away.

6199
04:05:54.120 --> 04:05:57.680
TALIESIN: Tomorrow morning, we let everyone know.

6200
04:05:57.680 --> 04:06:01.620
And then if everyone's okay with it,

6201
04:06:01.620 --> 04:06:04.710
that's what I think we should do next.

6202
04:06:04.710 --> 04:06:06.702
MARISHA: Look for the Kiln?

6203
04:06:08.110 --> 04:06:09.880
TALIESIN: It's the only thing that I can think of

6204
04:06:09.880 --> 04:06:11.990
unless someone's got a better idea.

6205
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:15.820
Unless the Bright Queen's got a better idea.

6206
04:06:15.820 --> 04:06:17.288
TRAVIS: I got nothing.

6207
04:06:17.288 --> 04:06:22.288
LIAM: Well, at least I think we...

6208
04:06:23.710 --> 04:06:28.420
But at least I was trying to curry favor with the queen.

6209
04:06:31.400 --> 04:06:35.462
For politics.

6210
04:06:36.380 --> 04:06:41.080
But we are

6211
04:06:41.080 --> 04:06:43.571
dealing with things we don't understand.

6212
04:06:45.450 --> 04:06:50.391
And I think it's time to stop the con

6213
04:06:51.567 --> 04:06:55.400
and face this.

6214
04:06:56.700 --> 04:06:58.840
And why don't we take it one step at a time?

6215
04:06:58.840 --> 04:07:00.606
We rest.

6216
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:05.878
Tomorrow, we contact the queen from here.

6217
04:07:05.878 --> 04:07:08.730
LAURA: Yeah.

6218
04:07:08.730 --> 04:07:11.270
LIAM: Come clean.

6219
04:07:11.270 --> 04:07:14.553
Because whatever this is, it is bigger than us.

6220
04:07:17.440 --> 04:07:21.380
We read her reaction.

6221
04:07:21.380 --> 04:07:23.372
We make a decision after that.

6222
04:07:25.900 --> 04:07:27.941
MARISHA: Telling her doesn't have to stop us from

6223
04:07:27.941 --> 04:07:29.360
finding the Kiln.

6224
04:07:29.360 --> 04:07:30.530
SAM: Absolutely.

6225
04:07:30.530 --> 04:07:31.610
LIAM: No.

6226
04:07:31.610 --> 04:07:33.795
TRAVIS: Unless they throw us in jail.

6227
04:07:33.795 --> 04:07:35.690
MARISHA: Not if we're not there for them.

6228
04:07:35.690 --> 04:07:38.070
TALIESIN: It'll take them an awful long time.

6229
04:07:38.070 --> 04:07:39.630
MARISHA: Yeah, we're in the middle of fucking nowhere.

6230
04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:41.280
TALIESIN: It seems like a waste.

6231
04:07:41.280 --> 04:07:43.765
LIAM: But cutting and running

6232
04:07:45.140 --> 04:07:48.550
with no explanation is not an option.

6233
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:50.920
We are partially responsible for this.

6234
04:07:50.920 --> 04:07:53.478
So we are going to take responsibility.

6235
04:07:54.371 --> 04:07:55.620
SAM: Yes, we'll take it in steps.

6236
04:07:55.620 --> 04:07:59.578
We can even contact,

6237
04:07:59.578 --> 04:08:02.744
what's his name, Hot Boi, Essek?

6238
04:08:02.744 --> 04:08:06.240
LAURA: I'm keeping an ear on the wall just to see.

6239
04:08:10.280 --> 04:08:12.130
SAM: Let's go rest.

6240
04:08:13.000 --> 04:08:14.600
TALIESIN: Thank you, Caleb.

6241
04:08:14.600 --> 04:08:17.340
LAURA: Let's go hide.

6242
04:08:17.340 --> 04:08:20.000
MARISHA: Do we have to go back into the barracks to rest?

6243
04:08:20.000 --> 04:08:23.100
TALIESIN: That would be sensible.

6244
04:08:23.100 --> 04:08:26.000
As far as we can get.

6245
04:08:26.000 --> 04:08:27.110
MATT: So you guys trek back to Bazzoxan?

6246
04:08:27.110 --> 04:08:30.950
SAM: Yeah, we'll ride back to Bazzoxan.

6247
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:32.080
MATT: Okay.

6248
04:08:32.080 --> 04:08:33.838
MARISHA: Caduceus.

6249
04:08:35.644 --> 04:08:38.820
You said you've been feeling like you've been pushed

6250
04:08:38.820 --> 04:08:41.750
towards this Kiln?

6251
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:42.850
It's what you keep calling it?

6252
04:08:42.850 --> 04:08:44.483
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6253
04:08:44.483 --> 04:08:46.310
MARISHA: Do you feel like it's close?

6254
04:08:46.310 --> 04:08:48.170
TALIESIN: I do.

6255
04:08:48.170 --> 04:08:50.503
I had a vision.

6256
04:08:52.291 --> 04:08:55.784
It was a mountain in a salt flat.

6257
04:08:55.784 --> 04:08:58.433
I can draw it.

6258
04:08:58.433 --> 04:09:00.300
I'll draw it for you.

6259
04:09:00.300 --> 04:09:03.600
It's a mountain without snow.

6260
04:09:03.600 --> 04:09:04.520
MATT: Interesting point to it.

6261
04:09:04.520 --> 04:09:08.230
It was a mountain without snow amongst mountains with snow.

6262
04:09:08.230 --> 04:09:09.800
And it looked like a salt flat,

6263
04:09:09.800 --> 04:09:14.574
but it also liked it had, it was white dunes.

6264
04:09:14.574 --> 04:09:15.920
TALIESIN: White sand.

6265
04:09:15.920 --> 04:09:17.870
MARISHA: Does that sound familiar to anything we've seen?

6266
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:19.650
MATT: Make a history check.

6267
04:09:19.650 --> 04:09:24.060
MARISHA: History check, all right.

6268
04:09:25.106 --> 04:09:28.170
Come on, come on, give me a win.

6269
04:09:28.170 --> 04:09:29.836
Okay.

6270
04:09:31.930 --> 04:09:33.040
20 total.

6271
04:09:33.040 --> 04:09:35.467
MATT: 20.
MARISHA: Yeah.

6272
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:41.003
MATT: Snow-capped mountains generally start fairly north.

6273
04:09:41.970 --> 04:09:44.090
There are snow-capped mountains along the north side

6274
04:09:44.090 --> 04:09:45.850
of the Dwendalian Empire.

6275
04:09:45.850 --> 04:09:47.860
Faint bits of snow that occasionally

6276
04:09:47.860 --> 04:09:51.510
hit elements of Xhorhas, you assume

6277
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:52.700
based on just topography,

6278
04:09:52.700 --> 04:09:55.480
but you haven't seen any since you've been here.

6279
04:09:55.480 --> 04:09:59.570
For like a snow mountain range amongst white dunes.

6280
04:09:59.570 --> 04:10:02.230
You do know that in the Greying Wildlands,

6281
04:10:02.230 --> 04:10:04.920
there is a large mountain range called the Flotket Alps.

6282
04:10:04.920 --> 04:10:07.490
MARISHA: The what?
MATT: The Flotket Alps.

6283
04:10:07.490 --> 04:10:08.720
LIAM: Flotket?
MATT: Flotket.

6284
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:13.789
MARISHA: In the Greying, okay.
MATT: The Greying Wildlands.

6285
04:10:13.789 --> 04:10:15.550
LIAM: And this is back home?

6286
04:10:15.550 --> 04:10:17.580
MATT: This is north of the Dwendalian Empire.

6287
04:10:17.580 --> 04:10:20.950
This is north of where you live, or where you grew up.

6288
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:22.270
TALIESIN: This is very north.

6289
04:10:22.270 --> 04:10:23.710
MATT: You're familiar with the Flotket Alps.

6290
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:24.910
Like if you mention this to Caduceus,

6291
04:10:24.910 --> 04:10:26.770
you know exactly what those are.

6292
04:10:26.770 --> 04:10:29.870
TALIESIN: Does that match what I have in my head or?

6293
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:31.536
MATT: It may. You've never been there.

6294
04:10:31.536 --> 04:10:32.580
You've never traveled there.

6295
04:10:32.580 --> 04:10:34.780
You've not really gone too far.

6296
04:10:34.780 --> 04:10:37.310
MARISHA: Flotket Alps?
MATT: Flotket Alps.

6297
04:10:37.310 --> 04:10:40.143
F-L-O-T-K-E-T.

6298
04:10:40.143 --> 04:10:41.550
MARISHA: K-E-T.

6299
04:10:41.550 --> 04:10:44.990
MATT: And he says white dunes, crystal,

6300
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:48.510
there is actually, and you've only read about it

6301
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:51.190
and it comes to mind, though you never paid attention

6302
04:10:51.190 --> 04:10:52.580
much at the time, there is a place

6303
04:10:52.580 --> 04:10:54.740
called the Crystalsands Tundra.

6304
04:10:54.740 --> 04:10:57.070
MARISHA: Crystal.

6305
04:10:57.070 --> 04:10:58.590
MATT: Sands Tundra.

6306
04:10:58.590 --> 04:11:01.290
But it's to the northwest of those alps.

6307
04:11:01.290 --> 04:11:03.280
TRAVIS: And this is the Dunrock Mountains?

6308
04:11:03.280 --> 04:11:04.850
MATT: Mm-hmm.

6309
04:11:04.850 --> 04:11:06.282
TALIESIN: Northwest.

6310
04:11:06.282 --> 04:11:08.350
TRAVIS: I don't have a map for that.

6311
04:11:08.350 --> 04:11:09.183
MATT: You do not.

6312
04:11:09.183 --> 04:11:10.230
LIAM: It's off the map.

6313
04:11:10.230 --> 04:11:14.360
TRAVIS: And the north it is above a body of water.

6314
04:11:16.467 --> 04:11:18.960
MARISHA: Wait, where are we?

6315
04:11:18.960 --> 04:11:21.203
TRAVIS: We're over here somewhere.

6316
04:11:21.203 --> 04:11:24.155
And it's up here.

6317
04:11:24.155 --> 04:11:25.770
MARISHA: Well, here's the Greying Wildlands.

6318
04:11:25.770 --> 04:11:27.419
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

6319
04:11:27.419 --> 04:11:29.770
MARISHA: And he said somewhere in there.

6320
04:11:29.770 --> 04:11:31.580
So we're talking here-ish?

6321
04:11:31.580 --> 04:11:33.740
MATT: Those mountains at the very, very top.

6322
04:11:33.740 --> 04:11:34.573
MARISHA: These?

6323
04:11:34.573 --> 04:11:37.530
MATT: Those probably could be the Flotket Alps.

6324
04:11:37.530 --> 04:11:38.810
MARISHA: Oh.

6325
04:11:38.810 --> 04:11:40.630
And this is a lake?

6326
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:41.820
MATT: That is a heavy lake, yes.

6327
04:11:41.820 --> 04:11:42.970
MARISHA: And that's what, dunes?

6328
04:11:42.970 --> 04:11:44.130
Is that land?

6329
04:11:44.130 --> 04:11:45.290
MATT: No.
MARISHA: Or is that water?

6330
04:11:45.290 --> 04:11:47.073
MATT: You don't know.

6331
04:11:49.452 --> 04:11:54.452
SAM: That's the Wildlands.

6332
04:11:56.191 --> 04:12:00.590
MARISHA: Okay.

6333
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:02.650
SAM: We'll have to figure this out tomorrow.

6334
04:12:04.620 --> 04:12:05.710
MARISHA: Not going to think about that now.

6335
04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:08.120
LAURA: We just ride and cry.

6336
04:12:08.120 --> 04:12:09.890
MATT: Sore.

6337
04:12:09.890 --> 04:12:11.880
Sad.

6338
04:12:11.880 --> 04:12:13.260
Contemplative.

6339
04:12:13.260 --> 04:12:17.109
You all quietly

6340
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:19.570
make your way through the subtle dust storms

6341
04:12:19.570 --> 04:12:23.262
of this north side of the Barbed Fields towards Bazzoxan

6342
04:12:24.730 --> 04:12:28.010
to see what the next step of your adventure is.

6343
04:12:28.010 --> 04:12:30.622
If I could have everyone but Yasha leave the table, please.

6344
04:12:30.622 --> 04:12:33.775
You could go.
SAM: Gross, Matt. Gross.

6345
04:12:33.775 --> 04:12:35.110
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
MARISHA: Oh man.

6346
04:12:35.110 --> 04:12:37.092
TALIESIN: Get out quick.
SAM: End whispers?

6347
04:12:37.092 --> 04:12:40.150
TRAVIS: Get out quick.
SAM: Oh, this is the worst.

6348
04:12:40.150 --> 04:12:42.330
MARISHA: Turn off the TV outside.

6349
04:12:42.330 --> 04:12:43.620
LAURA: No, I want to watch.

6350
04:12:43.620 --> 04:12:44.817
MATT: No, turn the TV off.
SAM: You can't,

6351
04:12:44.817 --> 04:12:46.957
that's the whole point.

6352
04:12:46.957 --> 04:12:49.409
LIAM: Man, that did not go good.
SAM: I am happy to have worn

6353
04:12:49.409 --> 04:12:53.400
this shirt tonight.
MATT: (laughs)

6354
04:12:53.400 --> 04:12:55.325
ASHLEY: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

6355
04:12:55.325 --> 04:12:57.083
SAM: ♪ Making my way downtown ♪

6356
04:12:57.083 --> 04:12:59.486
MARISHA: ♪ (A Thousand Miles) ♪

6357
04:13:01.328 --> 04:13:03.139
ASHLEY: My heart is racing.

6358
04:13:03.139 --> 04:13:04.739
Bye.

6359
04:13:06.100 --> 04:13:07.666
OFF-SCREEN: Clear.

6360
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:13.335
MATT: Through this experience,

6361
04:13:13.335 --> 04:13:15.693
the minute that burning sensation

6362
04:13:15.693 --> 04:13:19.176
seared into the back of your neck,

6363
04:13:19.176 --> 04:13:22.159
it was weirdly familiar.

6364
04:13:23.020 --> 04:13:27.740
You began to feel a rush of memories.

6365
04:13:27.740 --> 04:13:31.898
Of being found broken

6366
04:13:31.898 --> 04:13:34.690
in the wastes.

6367
04:13:34.690 --> 04:13:39.148
This red-skinned savior pulled you from the depths

6368
04:13:40.076 --> 04:13:44.134
and showed you an

6369
04:13:44.134 --> 04:13:46.410
angel like yourself

6370
04:13:46.410 --> 04:13:51.323
that could give the power you need

6371
04:13:52.588 --> 04:13:57.520
to maybe forgive yourself or perhaps one day

6372
04:13:57.520 --> 04:14:01.760
avenge those that took your love from you.

6373
04:14:01.760 --> 04:14:04.030
And you just see flashes.

6374
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:08.010
Flashes of laughter and conversations with this Obann

6375
04:14:08.010 --> 04:14:09.793
and others.

6376
04:14:11.130 --> 04:14:14.846
A traveling troupe of zealots

6377
04:14:14.846 --> 04:14:18.750
wandering these plains.

6378
04:14:18.750 --> 04:14:22.917
Flashes of you, brothers in arms,

6379
04:14:22.917 --> 04:14:26.360
flashes of you hunting those who wander too far

6380
04:14:26.360 --> 04:14:28.060
from their village.

6381
04:14:28.060 --> 04:14:31.900
Flashes of the bloodshed and carnage you caused.

6382
04:14:31.900 --> 04:14:36.893
Uncertain if it was within you this whole time

6383
04:14:37.950 --> 04:14:41.130
or was it this same burning?

6384
04:14:41.130 --> 04:14:43.146
You don't know.

6385
04:14:44.400 --> 04:14:48.399
You just know you kept being drawn to his yellow eyes

6386
04:14:48.399 --> 04:14:50.707
and his comforting voice.

6387
04:14:51.840 --> 04:14:53.998
Who knows how long?

6388
04:14:55.690 --> 04:14:58.510
You see yourself receded into your consciousness

6389
04:14:58.510 --> 04:15:01.680
looking through a tiny window.

6390
04:15:01.680 --> 04:15:04.820
Your body not your own.

6391
04:15:04.820 --> 04:15:06.528
Frozen in emotion,

6392
04:15:06.528 --> 04:15:11.228
watching your friends scream and flee.

6393
04:15:12.370 --> 04:15:16.270
You see the hulking mammoth Laughing Hand,

6394
04:15:16.270 --> 04:15:19.230
an entity you had heard the name once or twice

6395
04:15:19.230 --> 04:15:22.470
in the past, but had long forgotten.

6396
04:15:22.470 --> 04:15:27.290
Blacked out like all these memories.

6397
04:15:27.290 --> 04:15:29.256
And you see it slam

6398
04:15:29.256 --> 04:15:33.981
and slam and slam

6399
04:15:33.981 --> 04:15:36.620
into these barriers.

6400
04:15:36.620 --> 04:15:38.311
You help.

6401
04:15:38.311 --> 04:15:40.040
The two of you together watch

6402
04:15:40.040 --> 04:15:43.405
as the first barrier begins to crack and break.

6403
04:15:44.740 --> 04:15:47.520
And then shatter over time.

6404
04:15:53.190 --> 04:15:56.748
Another period passes,

6405
04:15:56.748 --> 04:16:00.060
with the strength of you two silently

6406
04:16:00.060 --> 04:16:03.700
smash through the next barrier,

6407
04:16:03.700 --> 04:16:06.292
which you shouldn't be able to do.

6408
04:16:06.292 --> 04:16:10.830
But this entity is far older and of a different make

6409
04:16:10.830 --> 04:16:13.920
than anything you've encountered before.

6410
04:16:13.920 --> 04:16:15.778
You're scared.

6411
04:16:18.340 --> 04:16:20.810
But you have no control.

6412
04:16:20.810 --> 04:16:22.340
Or do you?

6413
04:16:22.340 --> 04:16:24.940
That thought scares you.

6414
04:16:26.720 --> 04:16:31.450
Before the behemoth lumbers off,

6415
04:16:31.450 --> 04:16:35.350
slowly clawing both of your way to freedom once more,

6416
04:16:35.350 --> 04:16:38.328
you step back into the chamber

6417
04:16:39.690 --> 04:16:44.690
and gather in your hands the remaining ichor

6418
04:16:44.730 --> 04:16:47.218
that once was Obann.

6419
04:16:48.820 --> 04:16:53.473
And in it you can still feel the very faint thrum or beat.

6420
04:16:54.360 --> 04:16:57.860
Holding it in your hand, you turn

6421
04:16:57.860 --> 04:17:01.102
and follow your new lumbering friend.

6422
04:17:02.640 --> 04:17:05.060
Or at least the body does.

6423
04:17:05.060 --> 04:17:07.076
Or is it you?

6424
04:17:09.090 --> 04:17:11.040
You're scared.

6425
04:17:13.511 --> 04:17:16.163
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

6426
04:17:18.170 --> 04:17:19.967
ASHLEY: Holy moly.

6427
04:17:24.000 --> 04:17:25.453
MATT: We're going to miss you, Ashley.

6428
04:17:25.453 --> 04:17:28.147
(laughs)

6429
04:17:28.147 --> 04:17:29.863
ASHLEY: Augh, me too!

6430
04:17:31.119 --> 04:17:34.023
MATT: I know.

6431
04:17:34.023 --> 04:17:35.414
ASHLEY: All right.

6432
04:17:37.180 --> 04:17:40.970
That's, that's intense.

6433
04:17:40.970 --> 04:17:45.000
MATT: And that's the end of this chapter for Yasha.

6434
04:17:45.000 --> 04:17:46.430
ASHLEY: Okay.

6435
04:17:46.430 --> 04:17:50.610
MATT: I'll keep you updated as we go as to what that means

6436
04:17:50.610 --> 04:17:52.070
in other points of time.

6437
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:57.070
But regardless, an intense episode.

6438
04:17:57.090 --> 04:18:00.640
Thank you guys for joining us for a true dark night

6439
04:18:00.640 --> 04:18:04.400
of the soul moment of the campaign.

6440
04:18:04.400 --> 04:18:07.710
Just know we love you very, very much.

6441
04:18:07.710 --> 04:18:09.810
Happy Pride.
ASHLEY: Don't forget to love each other.

6442
04:18:09.810 --> 04:18:11.140
MATT: Don't forget to love each other.

6443
04:18:11.140 --> 04:18:14.695
And is it Thursday yet?

6444
04:18:14.695 --> 04:18:15.968
Good night.

6445
04:18:15.968 --> 04:18:20.643
[epic music]

We'll be using it to help us out in the\\ngame as we go, 'cause it's actually got some pretty\\ncool stuff. So excited about that.

       "Locations like Emon.\n",
       "Emon is very much the central fantasy Metropolis\n",
       "of this continent,\n",
       "at least from a human society standpoint.\n",
       "And so, these first episodes really kind of introduce us\n",
       "to that place.\n",
       "The initial sketches that Arthur did of Emon\n",
       "were so striking and so epic\n",
       "in scale and scope\n",
       "that we had to go back and look at Matt's original drawings\n",
       "and be like,\n",
       "is this right?\n",
       "Does this match?\n",
       "And it does.\n",
       "He took what Matt did on a 2D piece of paper\n",
       "and turned it into a 3D world.\n",
       "I think when you think of Emon\n",
       "compared to other fantasy cities that you know,\n",
       "like Rivendell,\n",
       "there's gonna be a certain familiarity to Emon\n",
       "because it's kind of like a fantasy New York.\n",
       "There are elements to it\n",
       "that I think everyone can recognize.\n",
       "Stylistically.\n",
       "We just wanted to give people a nice way\n",
       "to sort of slip into this medieval fantasy world\n",
       "without being too challenged with the weirdness of like\n",
       "all the other stuff that's going to come later.\n",
       "Beyond Emon,\n",
       "there are a few locations that we get to explore\n",
       "in the animated series first season.\n",
       "Early on we get to visit the Shale Steps,\n",
       "which is a place that was not seen in the campaign\n",
       "streamed wise\n",
       "it's a coastal fishing city\n",
       "among a unique looking cliff range.\n",
       "That itself looks like waves frozen\n",
       "in the motion of crashing onto a shore.\n",
       "And then Vox Machina as you know,\n",
       "makes the journey from Emon to Whitestone.\n",
       "And even the journey that they take.\n",
       "Arthur has taken again, early maps\n",
       "that Matt drew up and turn them into real places\n",
       "with transitions,\n",
       "from forest to desert,\n",
       "to jungle, to mountain.\n",
       "We're looking at different landscapes\n",
       "existing in the real world.\n",
       "Taking ideas from each of them\n",
       "and sort of assigning them locations\n",
       "within the Critical Role world.\n",
       "For example, when we get closer to Whitestone,\n",
       "things look a bit more like Yosemite,\n",
       "it's the Alabaster Sierras.\n",
       "So we picked from the actual high Sierras\n",
       "and took those shapes,\n",
       "and the way the trees look,\n",
       "and the way the vegetation spreads across them\n",
       "and assigned it.\n",
       "Our other large location for season one\n",
       "is going to be Whitestone.\n",
       "The architectural language we really wanted to play with\n",
       "and make sure that it felt authentic.\n",
       "He went back into the history of the world\n",
       "and the history of the continent\n",
       "and thought,\n",
       "if people had sailed here via a boat,\n",
       "what would their architecture like?\n",
       "So, all of our buildings kind of have\n",
       "this feeling of like a ship's bow coming out of the ground.\n",
       "All the rooftops have sort of that sloping ships hull\n",
       "sort of shape to it.\n",
       "And that's something that\n",
       "none of us would have ever thought of.\n",
       "Not even Matt, really.\n",
       "You can't really mention the city of Whitestone\n",
       "without mentioning the Sun Tree.\n",
       "The first time I saw the Sun Tree\n",
       "(sighs)\n",
       "It was so epic.\n",
       "I've seen some fantastic iterations of the Sun Tree\n",
       "but what Arthur dropped on us,\n",
       "the first time that we saw the Sun Tree\n",
       "literally made our jaws drop.\n",
       "I'm personally more a fan of the small moments.\n",
       "So, Gilmore's Goods.\n",
       "It's something that we've pictured in our head for so long\n",
       "of what Gilmore's Glorious Goods looks like.\n",
       "There's so much detail.\n",
       "It's very specific.\n",
       "That was another thing that kind of took me by surprise\n",
       "is sort of the work that everyone put in\n",
       "to understand the world\n",
       "that we've been playing in for the past five years.\n",
       "And it's beautiful.\n",
       "It's so good.\n",
       "All of our locations are very unique from each other\n",
       "and we've gone to great lengths\n",
       "to make sure that every element we include in every scene\n",
       "really expresses the world as clearly\n",
       "and takes it further than whatever\n",
       "we were originally seeing in the stream online.\n",
       "You really feel like these are drawings of real places\n",
       "and not just a quick sketch of a random temple.\n",
       "All starts on paper,\n",
       "a bunch of just words describing characters in a story.\n",
       "Then we start to try and visualize it with Arthur's team.\n",
       "It's a multistage process.\n",
       "We start with storyboards\n",
       "that we're working off of\n",
       "that sort of give us an idea what the shot is,\n",
       "where characters are gonna be standing\n",
       "and what the general action of the scene is.\n",
       "And then a background designer\n",
       "is going to take that storyboard\n",
       "and just really flesh out the composition,\n",
       "figure out what design elements we want in there.\n",
       "A background painter takes it next\n",
       "adds lighting.\n",
       "That lighting is basically used\n",
       "to enhance the storytelling moment.\n",
       "A really good background by itself without anything else,\n",
       "evokes emotion.\n",
       "It tells you instantly\n",
       "what the scene is going to be like.\n",
       "It's a lot like a DP for live action.\n",
       "You're trying to express\n",
       "what the story is telling you\n",
       "through light and color.\n",
       "when it comes,\n",
       "not even just to animation,\n",
       "but film in general,\n",
       "framing is everything.\n",
       "Wherever you place your characters\n",
       "and wherever you place your action\n",
       "is going to have an intense impact\n",
       "on how the audience feels\n",
       "and how the audience relates to what's happening.\n",
       "It's wild to do all these different things\n",
       "and then have them slowly converge\n",
       "into one final piece of media.\n",
       "We have many, many more months of production ahead of us.\n",
       "We're getting into the nitty gritty of it.\n",
       "It's a never ending circle of\n",
       "work, and creativity, and energy\n",
       "that's going into the series.\n",
       "Finally, all of this work,\n",
       "it's all come to fruition.\n",
       "We're really trying to elevate ourselves\n",
       "to create an animated show\n",
       "that even we've never done before.\n",

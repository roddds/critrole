00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.921
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.924
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:05.479
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.137
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:13.112
MATT: Everyone's already got
senioritis for the holidays, man.

6
00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.912
(laughter)

7
00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:17.208
TRAVIS: Senioritis!

8
00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:19.743
LIAM: You're right though, you're so goddamn right.

9
00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:20.858
(laughter)

10
00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:22.325
TALIESIN: Time for a shopping trip.

11
00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:25.312
MATT: Yeah, I'm used to having to like, close my ears.

12
00:00:25.312 --> 00:00:26.338
But yeah, welcome, guys.

13
00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:28.755
Before we get into tonight's session,

14
00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:30.387
that's the one I was going to say.

15
00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:31.434
Tonight's game, we're going to go ahead

16
00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:33.061
and go through a few announcements here,

17
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.506
beginning with our first of two sponsors for the night,

18
00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:39.626
beginning with our friends, returning from Idle Champions.

19
00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:41.316
Sam.

20
00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:43.470
SAM: Hey there, ladies and elves.

21
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.913
It's me, your ho ho host for the night, stand-up Santa.

22
00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.976
What, you don't believe I exist?

23
00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:51.530
Can't you feel my presence?

24
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.246
TRAVIS: Oh.
ASHLEY: Oh.

25
00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:55.649
SAM: No, you don't have sugar plums dancing in your head,

26
00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.814
it's really me, the St. Nick of shtick,

27
00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:00.082
doing a little advertising warm-up routine

28
00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.497
to get into the holiday spirit.

29
00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:03.188
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
SAM: Yeah, it's all like this.

30
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.466
TRAVIS: Is that plugged in?

31
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.382
SAM: Tonight-- No.

32
00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:08.049
(laughter)

33
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:10.298
Tonight's episode of Critical Role

34
00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:12.635
is brought to you by Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms,

35
00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.274
a strategy game that unites iconic Dungeons &amp; Dragons

36
00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:18.699
characters from novels, campaigns, and popular shows

37
00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:20.645
into one epic adventure.

38
00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:22.529
And speaking of epic adventures,

39
00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:25.590
you should try Mrs. Claus' meatloaf.

40
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.812
My wife's dinners are so bad, we pray after we eat.

41
00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:30.244
Actually...

42
00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:32.876
(laughter)

43
00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.978
Me and Mrs. Claus split up recently.

44
00:01:35.978 --> 00:01:37.895
I go out with the reindeer one night a year.

45
00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:40.767
Turns out, she goes with the elves every night of the year.

46
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:41.966
Ho!

47
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.457
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

48
00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.327
(groaning)
TALIESIN: Ho ho?

49
00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:48.027
SAM: But back to the ad.

50
00:01:48.027 --> 00:01:49.352
LIAM: Layers.

51
00:01:49.352 --> 00:01:51.191
SAM: The latest addition to Idle Champions

52
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.011
is the legendary Hand of Vecna.

53
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:56.216
Players can get a brand-new Hand of Vecna Arkhan skin

54
00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:00.662
and feat pack, that's F-E-A-T, not feet,

55
00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.246
for Joe Manganiello's infamous character Arkhan the Cruel,

56
00:02:04.246 --> 00:02:06.265
through the in-game shop.

57
00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:08.351
Speaking of the Hand of Vecna.

58
00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:10.077
TALIESIN: Weird to hear with that accent.

59
00:02:10.077 --> 00:02:11.140
SAM: Speaking of the Hand of Vecna,

60
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.749
I found out my wife enjoys the hand of Vic the elf

61
00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.382
while Santa's out hauling presents.

62
00:02:16.382 --> 00:02:18.840
Now I got to keep three lists: nice, naughty,

63
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.887
and divorce attorneys.

64
00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:22.823
ASHLEY: Oh boy.
LIAM: Ho!

65
00:02:22.823 --> 00:02:24.236
SAM: Ho!

66
00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:27.228
TRAVIS: Can you go "baa?"

67
00:02:27.228 --> 00:02:28.745
MATT: Can't all be winners.

68
00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:31.787
TRAVIS: Kind of look like a holiday goat.

69
00:02:31.787 --> 00:02:35.163
SAM: But back to the ad!

70
00:02:35.163 --> 00:02:38.233
The game's also available for PC and Mac on Steam and web,

71
00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:41.175
Xbox One, PlayStation 4, iPad, iPhone,

72
00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:43.106
and all Android devices.

73
00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:44.671
Hey, speaking of computers.

74
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:46.427
TALIESIN: Oh god!
ASHLEY: Oh no.

75
00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:48.265
SAM: I'm all over those dating sites.

76
00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:50.402
I'm on Single Kringle.

77
00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.908
(laughter)

78
00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:54.965
ASHLEY: That's a good joke.

79
00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:56.816
TALIESIN: You got one, well done.

80
00:02:56.816 --> 00:02:58.541
SAM: I'm on Ski Harmony.

81
00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:02.117
And my favorites on those cold North Pole nights,

82
00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:04.204
Match and Tinder. (chuckles)

83
00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.871
(groaning)

84
00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:09.911
Hey, I've gone out with lots of women,

85
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.403
but no one wants a second date.

86
00:03:11.403 --> 00:03:13.879
I guess they're Claustrophobic.

87
00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.054
ASHLEY: Oh wow.

88
00:03:15.907 --> 00:03:19.430
SAM: I'm telling you, those reindeer are starting to look

89
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.136
more attractive every day.

90
00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:23.728
Why do you think I call that one Vixen?

91
00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:27.393
What can I say, I've got low elf-esteem.

92
00:03:27.393 --> 00:03:28.988
(groaning and laughter)

93
00:03:28.988 --> 00:03:30.621
Okay, back to the ad.

Thank you, you been a great crowd, back to you, Matt.

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.404
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:47.189
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

102
00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.174
Thank you, Idle Champions.

103
00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:51.647
TALIESIN: Any theory that we actually
have writers on this show

104
00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:53.512
is now officially dead.

105
00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:57.500
SAM: I bombed for my own friends, I bombed!

106
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.203
ASHLEY: Hey.
MATT: We still love you, Sam.

107
00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:00.246
ASHLEY: I enjoyed it.

108
00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:01.944
(laughter)

109
00:04:01.944 --> 00:04:03.743
TALIESIN: I enjoyed the green screen.

110
00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.115
ASHLEY: I really liked the Single Kringle.

111
00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:07.687
TALIESIN: Single Kringle was good.

112
00:04:07.687 --> 00:04:09.291
MARISHA: Yeah, that was the standout.

113
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.757
ASHLEY: And the Vixen, that was, reindeer.

114
00:04:10.757 --> 00:04:12.545
SAM: Hey, I'll keep that one in the set.

115
00:04:12.545 --> 00:04:13.518
(laughter)

116
00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:14.503
MATT: He's workshopping here.

117
00:04:14.503 --> 00:04:16.344
SAM: Yeah, these are all new jokes.

118
00:04:16.344 --> 00:04:17.643
ASHLEY: You ended strong.
SAM: Thank you.

119
00:04:17.643 --> 00:04:20.482
TRAVIS: Do you teach any defensive comedy driving classes?

120
00:04:20.482 --> 00:04:23.149
(laughter)

121
00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:26.257
MATT: Okay.

122
00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:28.857
Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Idle Champions,

123
00:04:28.857 --> 00:04:30.536

124
00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.794
(laughter)

125
00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:33.906
And our second sponsor for tonight,

126
00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.501

127
00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:38.050
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond ♪

128
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.294
MATT: D&amp;D Beyond, of course,
if you don't know at this point,

129
00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:42.737
is a fantastic online tool for maintaining

130
00:04:42.737 --> 00:04:45.128

They're good folks that do good work,

and it's been super useful for us.

135
00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:56.744
So thank you guys for your continued support.

136
00:04:56.744 --> 00:04:59.258
And you won the wonderful gift tonight

137
00:04:59.258 --> 00:05:01.567
of not having that be your advertisement.

138
00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.067
(Sam and Matt laughing)

139
00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:04.974
TRAVIS: It is a gift.

140
00:05:04.974 --> 00:05:06.313
SAM: Idle Champions.

141
00:05:06.313 --> 00:05:07.744
(laughter)

142
00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:09.910
LIAM: I'll say this about it, though.

143
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.822
It was long.

144
00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:13.652
(laughter)

145
00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:14.784
TALIESIN: You did slay.

146
00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:18.049
(groaning)
SAM: Oh, that's a quality joke.

147
00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:21.043
TRAVIS: You did slay!

148
00:05:21.043 --> 00:05:21.893
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, is your

149
00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:24.268
special going to be on HB Snow?

150
00:05:24.268 --> 00:05:26.065
(groaning)

151
00:05:26.065 --> 00:05:27.340
SAM: I should really have pitched these jokes

152
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.577
to you guys first.

153
00:05:28.577 --> 00:05:29.838
(laughter)

154
00:05:29.838 --> 00:05:31.058
TRAVIS: It's contagious.

155
00:05:31.058 --> 00:05:32.738
MATT: This is problematic, is what it is.

156
00:05:32.738 --> 00:05:36.191
All right, so, our fantastic two sponsors.

157
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:37.934
Marisha, you have some announcements to make, don't you?

158
00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:39.950
MARISHA: (goofy) Yes!

159
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.016
(laughter)

160
00:05:42.016 --> 00:05:43.115
Woo.

161
00:05:43.115 --> 00:05:46.837
Next week will be our final week of live programming

162
00:05:46.837 --> 00:05:49.141
for the year, for 2019.

163
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:50.999
We will return from our winter break on

164
00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.699
Thursday, January 9th for Critical Role.

165
00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.772
Don't worry, we'll still have our normal broadcast

166
00:05:56.772 --> 00:06:01.104
next week, and you should definitely check out the finale

167
00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:05.491
for this season of Travis Willingham's Yee-Haw Game Ranch

168
00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:09.402
next week. It's going to be good, yeah.

169
00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:10.720
SAM: Are there secrets revealed?

170
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.253
MARISHA: Matt, Brian, and I, and Travis will be playing

171
00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:16.453
some Super Smash Brothers--

172
00:06:16.453 --> 00:06:18.003
TRAVIS: Oh!
MATT: Oh, you're all are going down.

173
00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:19.694
MARISHA: Yeah, at 4:00pm,

174
00:06:19.694 --> 00:06:22.317
December 17th, and yeah, we'll be taking a--

175
00:06:22.317 --> 00:06:24.103
MATT: I'm going to destroy all of you.

176
00:06:24.103 --> 00:06:25.344
MARISHA: It's bad.
MATT: I cannot wait.

177
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:27.122
MARISHA: You just, like--

178
00:06:27.122 --> 00:06:29.666
MATT: I didn't know it was going to be Smash Brothers.
TRAVIS: That's the one where you jump around?

179
00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:30.872
LIAM: Madness in his eyes.

180
00:06:30.872 --> 00:06:32.948
MATT: Fighting games is my thing.

181
00:06:32.948 --> 00:06:34.895
TALIESIN: This is a thing that happens.

182
00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:38.059
MARISHA: There's no rhyme or reason to like, balance

183
00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.053
or any type of fairness.
TRAVIS: Can we do three on one?

184
00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:41.604
Can we like, all three of us fight Matt?

185
00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:43.242
MARISHA: It's full-on brawl.
MATT: We can probably do that.

186
00:06:43.242 --> 00:06:44.576
TALIESIN: If you want to feel that bad about yourself.

187
00:06:44.576 --> 00:06:45.734
LIAM: Can we hold for a second?

188
00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:47.237
Sam has one Santa hair on his face

189
00:06:47.237 --> 00:06:48.290
and it looks like a Santa pube,

190
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.620
and I don't want to look at it anymore.

191
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.243
MARISHA: There we go.

192
00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:54.061
SAM: Thank you, thank you very much.

193
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:56.737
MARISHA: Yeah, but then after that we'll be taking

194
00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:59.947
a short break from Travis Willingham's Yee-Haw Game Ranch,

195
00:06:59.947 --> 00:07:03.481
and then we will return probably in the spring.

196
00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:04.356
MATT: Hell yeah.

197
00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:06.147
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

198
00:07:06.147 --> 00:07:07.580
TRAVIS: It is some dopey fun.

199
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.554
MARISHA: It is some dopey-ass fun.

200
00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:12.467
MATT: Wash the Mario Party out of my system.

201
00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:14.134
TRAVIS: You won.

202
00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:14.967
No, Marisha won.

203
00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.261
MATT: It's a Mario Party win.

204
00:07:16.261 --> 00:07:18.120
TRAVIS: Marisha won. You didn't win.

205
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.364
TALIESIN: Mario Party, I mean--

206
00:07:19.364 --> 00:07:21.510
MARISHA: Go Daisy!
MATT: Yeah, I won the final round.

207
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.736
ASHLEY: Wait, can I say a thank you real quick?

208
00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:24.569
MATT: Yeah, sure.

209
00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.221
ASHLEY: Thank you to Christina for making these

210
00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:28.216
most lovely bags for all of us.

211
00:07:28.216 --> 00:07:29.978
MARISHA: Yes, they're amazing.

212
00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:31.403
ASHLEY: They're so beautiful.

213
00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:33.235
Holy cow, yeah.

214
00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:34.717
TALIESIN: It's got secrets.

215
00:07:34.717 --> 00:07:36.413
ASHLEY: Look at this, the Stormlord.

216
00:07:36.413 --> 00:07:38.246
And on the inside, ah.

217
00:07:39.254 --> 00:07:40.489
MARISHA: Super cute.

218
00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:42.414
ASHLEY: The inside has flowers in it.

219
00:07:42.414 --> 00:07:44.028
MATT: Aww, that's amazing.

220
00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:45.893
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was so nice of you, thank you so much.

221
00:07:45.893 --> 00:07:47.591
TALIESIN: It's very nice, thank you.

222
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:49.143
ASHLEY: I love it.

223
00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:50.083
TALIESIN: I keep sorting my dice.

224
00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:51.629
MATT: Cool.

225
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:53.046
That's amazing.

226
00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:55.086
We have a few quick announcements to make after that.

227
00:07:55.086 --> 00:07:58.026
We did announce two of our convention dates for 2020.

228
00:07:58.026 --> 00:08:02.258
If those haven't seen yet, we will be at C2E2 in Chicago,

229
00:08:02.258 --> 00:08:04.215
coming up at the end of February.

230
00:08:04.215 --> 00:08:07.075
Super excited to be returning and see folks out there,

231
00:08:07.075 --> 00:08:11.301
and we are going back to London for MCM London

232
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:14.988
come May in 2020, super stoked to get over to Europe again

233
00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:16.901
to see a bunch of you folks.

234
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:18.349
Pre-sale autographs and photo op tickets

235
00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:21.051
will be on sale soon, check out critrole.com/events

236
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:23.563
for all the information regarding both events

237
00:08:23.563 --> 00:08:25.310
as it progresses.

238
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.951
TRAVIS: I'm fucking stoked, because Laura and I were

239
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:30.189
with child last time, so this is our first time

240
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:33.045
going to London with you guys.

241
00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:34.646
MARISHA: Yeah.

242
00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:36.153
TRAVIS: (weird accent) Going to Lon<i>don</i>.

243
00:08:36.153 --> 00:08:37.844
(laughter)

244
00:08:37.844 --> 00:08:38.765
ALL: "Lon<i>don</i>."

245
00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:40.250
ASHLEY: That's the proper way to say it.

246
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.437
MATT: That's RP British, yeah.

247
00:08:42.437 --> 00:08:43.809
TRAVIS: It's the Queen's English.

248
00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.921
MATT: (giggling)

249
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.671
TRAVIS: Your majesty. London.

250
00:08:48.802 --> 00:08:49.892
MATT: Awesome.

251
00:08:49.892 --> 00:08:51.980
Second announcement, for those who haven't seen,

252
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.446
our next issue of the comic book series Vox Machina Origins

253
00:08:55.446 --> 00:08:59.904
comes out next Wednesday, December 18th.

254
00:08:59.904 --> 00:09:03.268
This is a beautiful cover, and the interior

255
00:09:03.268 --> 00:09:06.626
is equally beautiful, fantastic work.

256
00:09:06.626 --> 00:09:09.687
All the artists in this team are amazing.

257
00:09:09.687 --> 00:09:12.780
The fantastic cover by Sam Hogg, one of our wonderful

258
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.546
critter artists, did a phenomenal job.

259
00:09:15.546 --> 00:09:17.812
SAM: Can I ask a question about this issue?

260
00:09:17.812 --> 00:09:19.438
Because I genuinely don't know.

261
00:09:19.438 --> 00:09:22.463
Do we finally get to know what happened with Grog?

262
00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:23.764
MATT: You'll have to read it.

263
00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:25.333
TALIESIN: Oh god, we actually get to find out?

264
00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:26.526
SAM: But is there an answer in the book?

265
00:09:26.526 --> 00:09:28.432
LIAM: You will have to find out on the 18th.

266
00:09:28.432 --> 00:09:29.891
SAM: Ugh!

267
00:09:29.891 --> 00:09:31.460
ASHLEY: Can I look at it?

268
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.968
MATT: Sure.
ASHLEY: Just up close.

269
00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:33.843
LIAM: It is a beautiful book.

270
00:09:33.843 --> 00:09:35.758
TALIESIN: This may be the one piece of lore

271
00:09:35.758 --> 00:09:38.009
that none of us know except for Travis and Matt.

272
00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:39.077
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

273
00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:40.275
LIAM: Oh man.
TRAVIS: What?

274
00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:41.459
MATT: And maybe we keep it that way.

275
00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:42.347
You don't know.

276
00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:43.215
TALIESIN: I hate you.

277
00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.333
MATT: (cackles)

278
00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:47.185
So yeah, definitely look for that next week,

279
00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:49.812
and join me and possibly a few other people

280
00:09:49.812 --> 00:09:52.222
that might show up next Wednesday as well

281
00:09:52.222 --> 00:09:54.523
on December 18th at 5:00pm Pacific

282
00:09:54.523 --> 00:09:56.596
here on our Twitch channel for an end of the year

283
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.827
fireside chat hangout.
MARISHA: Yay.

284
00:09:58.827 --> 00:10:01.188
MATT: We're going to be coming comfy in pajamas

285
00:10:01.188 --> 00:10:03.230
and whatever else you decide to wear.

286
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.707
Preferably come clothed, TOS and all.

287
00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:07.992
SAM: Not Single Kringle, no.

288
00:10:07.992 --> 00:10:08.990
MATT: Oh boy.

289
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.072
(laughter)

290
00:10:10.072 --> 00:10:12.141
We're going to be hanging out, answering questions,

291
00:10:12.141 --> 00:10:14.536
and just chatting with the community,

292
00:10:14.536 --> 00:10:16.718
wrapping up 2019 together.

293
00:10:16.718 --> 00:10:20.512
So see you guys next Wednesday at 5:00pm right here.

294
00:10:20.512 --> 00:10:22.508
Those are all of our announcements.

295
00:10:22.508 --> 00:10:26.067
We're hoping Laura might pop in at some point tonight.

296
00:10:26.067 --> 00:10:28.523
She has absconded to the Video Game Awards,

297
00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:30.072
which happened to be simultaneous.

298
00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:30.905
LIAM: Because she's the best!

299
00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:31.738
MATT: Because she is the best.
ASHLEY: Yeah!

300
00:10:31.738 --> 00:10:33.752
MATT: But if for whatever reason, she manages to--

301
00:10:33.752 --> 00:10:34.896
MARISHA: She should win!

302
00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:35.729
MATT: I know.

303
00:10:35.729 --> 00:10:38.117
But hopefully she'll show up at some point,

304
00:10:38.117 --> 00:10:40.759
if not, no worries, she has better things to do.

305
00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:42.271
TRAVIS: She looks so pretty.

306
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:44.131
MATT: I know.
ASHLEY: She does look so pretty.

307
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:45.712
MATT: That's it and that's all, so I think it's time

308
00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:50.671
for us to dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

309
00:10:53.177 --> 00:10:55.498

(dragon roaring)

344
00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:30.220
MATT: Welcome back.

345
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.599
That got intense.

346
00:12:31.599 --> 00:12:33.349
Now everyone's awake.

347
00:12:34.527 --> 00:12:39.223
So, last we left off, the Mighty Nein had found their way

348
00:12:39.223 --> 00:12:42.138
to the capital of the Empire, Rexxentrum,

349
00:12:42.138 --> 00:12:45.397
to discover both a Kryn Dynasty assault on the city,

350
00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:48.407
overlapping simultaneously with the arrival of Obann

351
00:12:48.407 --> 00:12:52.426
and his found family of seemingly unkillable figures

352
00:12:52.426 --> 00:12:54.529
he had collected as part of a ritual

353
00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:58.243
to unleash the Angel of Irons, which had been found

354
00:12:58.243 --> 00:13:02.212
to actually be Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion,

355
00:13:02.212 --> 00:13:04.531
catfishing the fuck out of Obann,

356
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:07.481
as well as the rest of the cult, it seems.

357
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:11.261
You managed to destroy the Laughing Hand,

358
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:13.538
free Yasha from the mind control that Obann

359
00:13:13.538 --> 00:13:17.529
had inflicted upon her, destroy Obann's physical form.

360
00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:18.999
In the moment before he could return

361
00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.379
back to the Hells to reform, he was punished

362
00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:23.800
for his inability to fulfill his promise,

363
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.054
realizing Tharizdun, in the final moment,

364
00:13:27.054 --> 00:13:30.707
was corrupted into what was Obann the Punished,

365
00:13:30.707 --> 00:13:35.070
a horribly malformed, inky, tentacled creation,

366
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.664
an abomination in the image of the Chained Oblivion.

367
00:13:38.664 --> 00:13:41.289
You did battle with this creature,

368
00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:43.798
barely managing to scrape by because you have

369
00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:48.300
two clerics in your group, one of which is a grave cleric.

370
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.340
I'm learning lessons on how much harder

371
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.327
I have to come at you guys.

372
00:13:51.327 --> 00:13:53.171
TRAVIS: No, no, no, don't, no lessons.

373
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:56.251
MATT: And some lucky rolls, some really lucky rolls.

374
00:13:56.251 --> 00:13:57.386
LIAM: Don't forget to love each other?

375
00:13:57.386 --> 00:13:59.154
MATT: Yeah, love each other, guys.

376
00:14:00.212 --> 00:14:05.212
In doing so, you found your ally, Pumat,

377
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:08.567
heavily hurt, but survived.

378
00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:12.011
You garnished the attention of the Righteous Brand,

379
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.850
and it seemed that this incursion by the Kryn had,

380
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.980
almost simultaneously with your battle,

381
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.042
ended in retreat, seemingly for no reason.

382
00:14:22.042 --> 00:14:25.323
You were then brought by a captain of the Righteous Brand

383
00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.531
to Castle Ungebroch,

384
00:14:28.464 --> 00:14:32.737
to meet with King Dwendal himself

385
00:14:32.737 --> 00:14:35.481
of the Dwendalian Empire, along with a number

386
00:14:35.481 --> 00:14:38.688
of other figures currently in his council at the moment,

387
00:14:38.688 --> 00:14:43.663
including Allura Vysoren, the head of Rexxentrum's Archive,

388
00:14:46.449 --> 00:14:50.490
and Sydnoc Truscan,

389
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.065
the Prime Arbiter of the Empire,

390
00:14:54.286 --> 00:14:59.286
and you saw to be Trent Ikithon alongside

391
00:14:59.627 --> 00:15:02.740
the Martinet Ludinus Da'leth.

392
00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.506
During this period of time, it was revealed

393
00:15:04.506 --> 00:15:08.217
that Ludinus' associate, his assistant, if you will,

394
00:15:08.217 --> 00:15:10.177
Vence, seemed to be the figure heavily tied

395
00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:13.366
into this cult business, much to his surprise at seeing,

396
00:15:13.366 --> 00:15:15.826
and those of the council.

397
00:15:15.826 --> 00:15:19.007
You were also discussing your interactions

398
00:15:19.007 --> 00:15:22.360
with Xhorhas and the Bright Queen, and it was revealed

399
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.189
as part of this conversation, your interactions there,

400
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:29.672
and the alliance that you had made

401
00:15:29.672 --> 00:15:32.170
on that side of the conflict.

402
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.484
As part of that, you were charged with

403
00:15:36.484 --> 00:15:41.285
using this relationship, possibly helping bring about

404
00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:46.285
some sort of a meeting, a parley, a negotiation,

405
00:15:46.585 --> 00:15:50.983
to possibly bring elements of this conflict to an end,

406
00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.391
as it seems that a large portion of this conflict

407
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:57.415
stemming from the theft or disappearance of these beacons,

408
00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:58.740
supposedly by the Empire,

409
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.531
the members of the Cerberus Assembly say they've

410
00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:07.664
recovered the relic in question and are eager to return it

411
00:16:07.664 --> 00:16:11.071
if it means the bloodshed will come to an end.

412
00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:15.323
So, given this missive by the King of the Empire,

413
00:16:15.323 --> 00:16:18.339
you were assigned to meet in the coming morning

414
00:16:18.339 --> 00:16:20.591
with the Martinet himself to discuss

415
00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:23.582
how to go about this plan of action.

416
00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:28.347
So, Mighty Nein, as you exit, assisted by a number

417
00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:30.873
of members of the Righteous Brand,

418
00:16:30.873 --> 00:16:33.290
you are giving your weapons back that you had left

419
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.269
within the waiting chamber, and you are pushed back out

420
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:39.299
into the Shimmer Ward, at this point

421
00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:43.102
now in the later afternoon, the clouded skies

422
00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:46.935
starting to take the color of a coming sunset,

423
00:16:47.927 --> 00:16:50.048
and the afternoon is yours.

424
00:16:50.048 --> 00:16:53.265
You know supposedly rooms are going to be

425
00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:56.317
situated or prepared for you at a place referred to

426
00:16:56.317 --> 00:16:59.710
as the Camarouth Cottage here in the Shimmer Ward,

427
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.014
and in the morning you will be meeting with Ludinus.

428
00:17:04.014 --> 00:17:05.682
LIAM: Point of clarification.
MATT: Yes?

429
00:17:05.682 --> 00:17:07.776
LIAM: These motherfuckers right here, from the Assembly,

430
00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:11.290
said they just found-- like recently found-- the beacon.

431
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.857
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Okay.

432
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.703
Lying motherfuckers.

433
00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.203
MATT: Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

434
00:17:23.178 --> 00:17:28.176
So, escorted out of the castle terrace.

435
00:17:28.176 --> 00:17:31.647
You are let within the Shimmer Ward,

436
00:17:31.647 --> 00:17:34.743
and the guards go back into the castle.

437
00:17:34.743 --> 00:17:36.958
You are no longer under watch,

438
00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.184
and the Shimmer Ward is yours.

439
00:17:38.184 --> 00:17:39.748
SAM: There's no escort with us?

440
00:17:39.748 --> 00:17:41.112
MATT: At the moment, no.

441
00:17:41.112 --> 00:17:42.789
TALIESIN: Are we being shadowed?

442
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:44.206
MATT: Make a perception check.

443
00:17:44.206 --> 00:17:45.039
TRAVIS: Come on, first roll of the night.

444
00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:46.622
Let's go, Taliesin, hey, hey, hey.

445
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.293
TALIESIN: No, sadly it's only a 15.

446
00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.440
MATT: You're looking around in the vicinity.

447
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.488
You do not see yourselves being

448
00:17:57.488 --> 00:17:59.229
immediately shadowed or followed.

449
00:17:59.229 --> 00:18:00.137
TALIESIN: Okay.

450
00:18:01.238 --> 00:18:03.659
I think we might be in the clear.

451
00:18:03.659 --> 00:18:08.659
TRAVIS: The sun is setting; should we perhaps find a place

452
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:11.189
to lodge for the night,

453
00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:14.908
and discuss what just happened?

454
00:18:14.908 --> 00:18:18.834
LIAM: They are putting us up.
SAM: The cottage, is that right?

455
00:18:18.834 --> 00:18:20.656
MARISHA: Camarouth Cottage.

456
00:18:20.656 --> 00:18:22.393
LIAM: Camarouth?
MARISHA: Camarouth.

457
00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:23.227
MATT: Camarouth.

458
00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.671
TRAVIS: I'm on the wrong page of notes, one second.

459
00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:27.030
TALIESIN: I don't know about the rest of you,

460
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.577
but the less time we spend in this place,

461
00:18:28.577 --> 00:18:30.422
the happier I'll be.

462
00:18:30.422 --> 00:18:33.474
Do we want to try and stock up on anything before we--?

463
00:18:33.474 --> 00:18:35.283
SAM: This is Caleb's hometown.

464
00:18:35.283 --> 00:18:37.565
Don't disparage it in front of him.

465
00:18:37.565 --> 00:18:38.860
TALIESIN: I'm not disparaging it.

466
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.940
I'm just saying, this place gives me the creeps.

467
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.946
MARISHA: I have a feeling he's not offended by that.

468
00:18:43.946 --> 00:18:45.057
TALIESIN: Are you offended by that?

469
00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:46.377
LIAM: I'm not offended by that.

470
00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:47.453
TALIESIN: Yeah, see, it's fine.

471
00:18:47.453 --> 00:18:50.633
SAM: I retract my chiding.
TALIESIN: Fair.

472
00:18:50.633 --> 00:18:53.646
LIAM: I need to pick up a few things.

473
00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:56.530
What do you need? I can probably get us there.

474
00:18:57.867 --> 00:18:59.583
TALIESIN: Health potions.

475
00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:00.652
SAM: Oh, yes.

476
00:19:00.652 --> 00:19:02.402
TALIESIN: Diamonds, anything.

477
00:19:03.497 --> 00:19:06.354
Stocking up for every inevitability.

478
00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.337
TRAVIS: Our normal fare.

479
00:19:07.337 --> 00:19:09.433
SAM: Yeah, normal things that people buy:

480
00:19:09.433 --> 00:19:12.273
diamonds and health potions.

481
00:19:12.273 --> 00:19:16.476
LIAM: Do I have any insight as to-- this is New York City.

482
00:19:16.476 --> 00:19:19.517
I know fairly well, except I've never been here,

483
00:19:19.517 --> 00:19:22.992
because this is my first time.
MATT: The places that you--

484
00:19:22.992 --> 00:19:25.415
you didn't commonly frequent

485
00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.669
these locations. You were still a student.

486
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:28.992
LIAM: Yeah.

487
00:19:28.992 --> 00:19:31.900
MATT: And on a student's income, which was nothing at all.

488
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.993
LIAM: Right, so I saw a small percentage.

489
00:19:32.993 --> 00:19:34.092
MATT: A very small percentage.

490
00:19:34.092 --> 00:19:35.789
And most of the interactions you had

491
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:38.244
with healing potions and such were those that were given out

492
00:19:38.244 --> 00:19:41.010
as part of your training at the Soltryce Academy,

493
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.877
and then otherwise were places that were

494
00:19:43.877 --> 00:19:48.012
specifically being organized by the Cerberus Assembly.

495
00:19:48.012 --> 00:19:49.663
A lot of those places you gather

496
00:19:49.663 --> 00:19:51.605
are probably connected to the war effort,

497
00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:53.620
but you go ahead and make a history check for me.

498
00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.748
LIAM: I was going to say, do I know anything

499
00:19:54.748 --> 00:19:56.332
about the different wards, at least?

500
00:19:56.332 --> 00:19:58.061
Knowing the different areas?

501
00:19:58.061 --> 00:19:59.681
MATT: Yeah, yeah, if you have any questions,

502
00:19:59.681 --> 00:20:02.319
you have the map there, but the--

503
00:20:02.319 --> 00:20:04.302
LIAM: I rolled a one.

504
00:20:04.302 --> 00:20:06.168
MATT: Rolled a one? Well.

505
00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:08.677
Well.

506
00:20:08.677 --> 00:20:10.373
TALIESIN: Shook up, huh?

507
00:20:10.373 --> 00:20:11.793
MATT: You may have to ask around, then.

508
00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:13.401
(laughs)

509
00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:14.234
There's the Mosaic Ward,

510
00:20:14.234 --> 00:20:16.917
which is the northern, impoverished neighborhood,

511
00:20:16.917 --> 00:20:19.561
which is largely a very muddy district.

512
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:23.014
The streets-- it's the one part of the city

513
00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:24.336
where it isn't really cobblestone.

514
00:20:24.336 --> 00:20:25.620
The streets just become dirt,

515
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.664
and because of the fairly common moisture and rainfall

516
00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:30.396
that happens here, it leads to

517
00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:32.067
an extremely brown, muddy district.

518
00:20:32.067 --> 00:20:35.068
So it's what's referred to as the Mosaic Ward.

519
00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.260
It's really just one color and it's--

520
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.260
TALIESIN: Nice name.

521
00:20:39.222 --> 00:20:41.191
MATT: I'm sorry, that's the Mudtop Ward.

522
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:42.639
The Mosaic Ward--
TALIESIN: Mudtop.

523
00:20:42.639 --> 00:20:44.572
MATT: Mudtop makes a lot more sense.

524
00:20:44.572 --> 00:20:45.612
It's my brain.

525
00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:46.901
TRAVIS: That's amazing.
MATT: That's pretty great.

526
00:20:46.901 --> 00:20:51.684
The Mosaic Ward is a lot more colorful.

527
00:20:51.684 --> 00:20:54.259
Colorful banners, small fences.

528
00:20:55.207 --> 00:20:57.207
It's a housing district.

529
00:20:58.108 --> 00:20:59.830
That's mostly on the Southern portion of the city.

530
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.377
MARISHA: Oh, it's like the arts district?

531
00:21:02.377 --> 00:21:04.370
MATT: In some ways.

532
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.060
The Tangles is what you're most familiar with,

533
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.326
and that's what you guys have traveled through mostly,

534
00:21:07.326 --> 00:21:09.768
which is the central, it's a semicircle region

535
00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:14.760
to the center and southwestern side of the village.

536
00:21:16.737 --> 00:21:19.368
That's where a lot of the working class resides in the city.

537
00:21:19.368 --> 00:21:21.751
A lot of the general commerce happens there.

538
00:21:21.751 --> 00:21:23.756
There are many, many smaller streets,

539
00:21:23.756 --> 00:21:28.756
and the overall look of where everything meets

540
00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:31.376
and gathers in the way that the streets

541
00:21:31.376 --> 00:21:33.717
weave through the city looks like a large tangle

542
00:21:33.717 --> 00:21:35.974
from an overhead view.

543
00:21:35.974 --> 00:21:37.997
It's where the city was first built, and as it expanded,

544
00:21:37.997 --> 00:21:40.014
the structure seemed to, you know,

545
00:21:40.014 --> 00:21:44.069
find a better means of being planned out and built.

546
00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:46.673
So the center, towards the city outside of the Shimmer Ward,

547
00:21:46.673 --> 00:21:49.452
it's a little messier and it's the older parts of the town.

548
00:21:49.452 --> 00:21:51.836
LIAM: And the academy is in the Shimmer Ward, <i>ja</i>?

549
00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:52.695
MATT: Correct.

550
00:21:52.695 --> 00:21:54.029
TALIESIN: Ooh.

551
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:56.011
We haven't taken a short rest either.

552
00:21:56.011 --> 00:21:58.441
We are all just beat to fuck right now, aren't we?

553
00:21:58.441 --> 00:22:00.024
TRAVIS: Yep.
LIAM: I'm on death's door.

554
00:22:00.024 --> 00:22:01.557
SAM: And what time of day is it?

555
00:22:01.557 --> 00:22:03.429
MATT: It's late afternoon, probably starting to get

556
00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:06.396
closer to sunset in the next hour or so.

557
00:22:06.396 --> 00:22:08.589
TALIESIN: Do maybe--
SAM: Go night night?

558
00:22:08.589 --> 00:22:12.690
TALIESIN: Maybe we just turn in, then, and save going out

559
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.324
into the world for tomorrow.
TRAVIS: Love that.

560
00:22:14.324 --> 00:22:16.357
LIAM: Excuse me, Grandfather.

561
00:22:16.357 --> 00:22:17.190
MATT: "Yes?"

562
00:22:19.262 --> 00:22:22.092
This really well-dressed, older human gentleman,

563
00:22:22.092 --> 00:22:24.349
lots of jewelry on his fingers

564
00:22:24.349 --> 00:22:27.616
and jangling bands around his wrists turns,

565
00:22:27.616 --> 00:22:30.893
liver spotted head where the hair is receded

566
00:22:30.893 --> 00:22:33.574
back into this advanced widow's peak

567
00:22:33.574 --> 00:22:35.944
that comes very far forward, and the back of it

568
00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:38.065
reaches the very top of the head, turns.

569
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:40.008
"Can I help you?"

570
00:22:40.008 --> 00:22:44.433
LIAM: We are not from these parts, and I am looking

571
00:22:44.433 --> 00:22:49.433
to do some shopping. I need some jewels, specifically,

572
00:22:50.096 --> 00:22:52.387
and then also maybe you know of shops

573
00:22:52.387 --> 00:22:55.591
that cater to arcane nature?

574
00:22:55.591 --> 00:22:57.758
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

575
00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:00.716
TRAVIS: How much money you got?

576
00:23:00.716 --> 00:23:01.751
MATT: That's cocked.

577
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:02.834
LIAM: Okay, cool.

578
00:23:03.721 --> 00:23:05.279
That was almost the same thing.

579
00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:06.388
Persuasion?

580
00:23:06.388 --> 00:23:07.586
MATT: Yes.

581
00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:09.095
LIAM: 11.

582
00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:13.284
MATT: He goes, "Sorry, I don't have anything to give you."

583
00:23:13.284 --> 00:23:15.778
And quickly turns away and ignores you.

584
00:23:15.778 --> 00:23:17.957
SAM: No, no, he's not a beggar, he just looks--

585
00:23:17.957 --> 00:23:18.895
MATT: "Ah!"

586
00:23:18.895 --> 00:23:20.218
SAM: Oh, sorry.

587
00:23:20.218 --> 00:23:22.692
MATT: And he just quickly shuffles--
ASHLEY: No, it's okay.

588
00:23:22.692 --> 00:23:24.690
MATT: "Gah!"
(laughter)

589
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.102
MATT: "I don't want to new trouble."

590
00:23:26.102 --> 00:23:28.169
Looks around at the whole crew now circling.

591
00:23:28.169 --> 00:23:29.990
TRAVIS: I use Mask of Many Faces to look like a piranha

592
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.549
and I'm like: (growling) Tell us where it is!

593
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:33.582
(laughter)

594
00:23:33.582 --> 00:23:35.040
MATT: Where are the diamonds?

595
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.218
(laughs)

596
00:23:37.218 --> 00:23:39.017
LIAM: All right, well, Caduceus, maybe we should wipe

597
00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:40.226
all this blood off of ourselves.

598
00:23:40.226 --> 00:23:42.220
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should.

599
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.411
It occurs to me I'm a little worse for wear right now.

600
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:47.068
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

601
00:23:47.068 --> 00:23:47.980
Oh god.

602
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.279
ASHLEY: I forgot about that.

603
00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:51.958
TALIESIN: (chuckles)

604
00:23:51.958 --> 00:23:54.762
SAM: Do you know where this place is?

605
00:23:54.762 --> 00:23:55.834
TRAVIS: Camarouth Cottage.

606
00:23:55.834 --> 00:23:57.607
SAM: Yes, but where in town?

607
00:23:57.607 --> 00:23:59.153
You know where it is, Cay-Cay?

608
00:23:59.153 --> 00:24:00.508
LIAM: Where did they tell us it was?

609
00:24:00.508 --> 00:24:02.327
TRAVIS: The Shimmer Ward.
MATT: They didn't tell you where it was.

610
00:24:02.327 --> 00:24:04.313
But it wouldn't take you too long to find it.

611
00:24:04.313 --> 00:24:08.543
The Shimmer Ward isn't extensively massive.

612
00:24:08.543 --> 00:24:10.495
And looking around, I'd say it'd take you

613
00:24:10.495 --> 00:24:11.765
about 10 minutes or so to locate it.

614
00:24:11.765 --> 00:24:14.118
It's on the southwestern side of the Shimmer Ward,

615
00:24:14.118 --> 00:24:16.332
not too far from the main gates where you entered.

616
00:24:16.332 --> 00:24:17.771
LIAM: Okay.

617
00:24:17.771 --> 00:24:19.022
MATT: Probably placed there because it's closest

618
00:24:19.022 --> 00:24:22.253
to where most of the foot traffic enters and exits the area.

619
00:24:22.253 --> 00:24:24.698
LIAM: All right, we limp our way there.

620
00:24:24.698 --> 00:24:25.771
MATT: Okay.

621
00:24:25.771 --> 00:24:27.826
You guys eventually come upon a beautiful,

622
00:24:27.826 --> 00:24:30.656
expansive, two-story inn of pale yellow stone

623
00:24:30.656 --> 00:24:33.420
and braided thatch for roofing.

624
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.619
The windowsill gardens are lush,

625
00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:37.916
and the rooms each hold their own separate balconies

626
00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:39.820
that overlook the entirety of the ward,

627
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.979
visible from that second floor.

628
00:24:41.979 --> 00:24:44.455
As you approach, the front doors are actually

629
00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:47.637
partially ajar, and you can see there's wooden wedges

630
00:24:47.637 --> 00:24:50.468
jammed underneath to keep them somewhat open.

631
00:24:50.468 --> 00:24:53.115
There are some puddles of water that you

632
00:24:53.115 --> 00:24:55.461
maneuver around before you get to the front entryway.

633
00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:58.037
But as you step inside, you can already see

634
00:24:58.037 --> 00:25:00.429
the nice dark cherry wood interior

635
00:25:00.429 --> 00:25:04.193
and the tall ceilings that make up the main entryway.

636
00:25:04.193 --> 00:25:08.012
There's magically lit chandeliers of dark iron,

637
00:25:08.012 --> 00:25:11.116
large circular rings that two of them

638
00:25:11.116 --> 00:25:13.818
overall light to the inside of the building.

639
00:25:13.818 --> 00:25:15.629
You can see a staircase immediately to the left

640
00:25:15.629 --> 00:25:17.224
of a front desk region

641
00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:19.057
that leads to the secondary floor.

642
00:25:19.057 --> 00:25:21.250
Ultimately, you know, two stories,

643
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.059
and you've seen a lot of, especially in the central cities,

644
00:25:23.059 --> 00:25:24.803
inns that will stack up multiple floors

645
00:25:24.803 --> 00:25:27.072
to try and best use the space they have for the plot.

646
00:25:27.072 --> 00:25:28.242
Because this is in the more affluent area

647
00:25:28.242 --> 00:25:29.926
and this may have been here for quite some time,

648
00:25:29.926 --> 00:25:31.593
it's a little more expansive.

649
00:25:31.593 --> 00:25:34.586
It's a much larger inn as far as the breadth

650
00:25:34.586 --> 00:25:37.136
of the portion of land that it takes up.

651
00:25:37.136 --> 00:25:38.441
SAM: Is there one of those classy guys

652
00:25:38.441 --> 00:25:40.600
playing a piano in the lobby, or?

653
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.566
MATT: No, there isn't somebody in the inn playing a little--

654
00:25:42.566 --> 00:25:44.060
TRAVIS: It's not a saloon, you dork.

655
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.408
(laughter)

656
00:25:45.408 --> 00:25:46.541
ASHLEY: Just some muzak.

657
00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:47.424
TRAVIS: Some muzak.
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

658
00:25:47.424 --> 00:25:49.555
ASHLEY and MATT: (hum muzak)

659
00:25:50.446 --> 00:25:54.117
MATT: Like a small saxophone version
of Your Turn to Roll comes in.

660
00:25:54.117 --> 00:25:56.084
(laughter)

661
00:25:56.084 --> 00:25:57.546
You do see an attached doorway on the right

662
00:25:57.546 --> 00:25:59.296
that opens up into what you think is a tavern

663
00:25:59.296 --> 00:26:01.234
or dining hall of some kind.

664
00:26:01.234 --> 00:26:03.459
You smell food cooking, but it doesn't sound like

665
00:26:03.459 --> 00:26:05.365
it's busy yet, like they're preparing probably

666
00:26:05.365 --> 00:26:06.801
for an evening rush.

667
00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:08.732
At that front counter, you do see

668
00:26:08.732 --> 00:26:13.516
an elderly female dwarf, stark white hair

669
00:26:13.516 --> 00:26:15.919
that is braided thick and then

670
00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:17.845
wrapped around itself into this large bun

671
00:26:17.845 --> 00:26:20.071
that's about the size of the rest of her head.

672
00:26:20.071 --> 00:26:22.092
It almost gives like a halo behind the back of it,

673
00:26:22.092 --> 00:26:25.354
the way it frames the top.

674
00:26:25.354 --> 00:26:29.090
With every single wrinkle, you can see they're all placed

675
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.223
by the wide smile that immediately

676
00:26:31.223 --> 00:26:33.124
comes across her face as she looks up to the rest of you

677
00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:37.257
and goes, "Yeah, can I help you?"

678
00:26:37.257 --> 00:26:38.725
(Sam laughing)

679
00:26:38.725 --> 00:26:40.582
LIAM: I believe so, yeah.

680
00:26:40.582 --> 00:26:43.620
MATT: "I'm Kela Camarouth, this is my cottage."

681
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.703
TRAVIS: Keller?
LIAM: Kela?

682
00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:45.669
MATT: "Kela."

683
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:46.502
LIAM: Kela.

684
00:26:46.502 --> 00:26:48.885
MARISHA: Keller.
SAM: Keller Kela.

685
00:26:48.885 --> 00:26:50.794
LIAM: Kela Camarouth.

686
00:26:50.794 --> 00:26:54.456
Excellent, so this is your place, it's a family business.

687
00:26:54.456 --> 00:26:57.073
MATT: "It is, my grandkids help out."

688
00:26:57.073 --> 00:26:57.906
LIAM: Wonderful.

689
00:26:57.906 --> 00:27:00.939
TRAVIS: (giggles)

690
00:27:00.939 --> 00:27:04.855
LIAM: We are to be guests here,

691
00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:07.669
of the king and the Cerberus Assembly,

692
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:09.230
I believe arrangements were made.

693
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.273
We are The Mighty Nein.

694
00:27:11.273 --> 00:27:14.457
MATT: "Right, right," she pulls up a small piece of paper

695
00:27:14.457 --> 00:27:18.394
with like a hastily scribbled note on it and goes,

696
00:27:18.394 --> 00:27:22.592
"Ah, yes, yes, this is already paid for,

697
00:27:22.592 --> 00:27:25.133
"under the intent of the Assembly,

698
00:27:25.133 --> 00:27:28.153
"so rooms have been arranged individually.

699
00:27:28.153 --> 00:27:33.153
"Seven such chambers, keys to be, here you are,"

700
00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:36.941
puts down like, seven really nice iron keys on the table.

701
00:27:36.941 --> 00:27:39.295
They're all intricately carved,

702
00:27:39.295 --> 00:27:42.897
and beautifully done, as opposed to
rougher keys you find across

703
00:27:42.897 --> 00:27:45.446
most portions of your travels.
MARISHA: Wow. We're at that point in our career.

704
00:27:45.446 --> 00:27:46.279
SAM: Wow.

705
00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:48.567
TRAVIS: Yeah, we be come ups. Started at the bottom.

706
00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:50.914
Look where we is.

707
00:27:50.914 --> 00:27:53.585
LIAM: I know I smell something delicious.

708
00:27:53.585 --> 00:27:57.780
Is food available to be served at the moment?

709
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.005
MATT: "Not at the moment, but it should be within

710
00:28:00.005 --> 00:28:03.095
"about the next hour or so, if you hang around.

711
00:28:03.095 --> 00:28:06.177
"You should see the crowds gathering around that time,

712
00:28:06.177 --> 00:28:08.274
"so just keep a keen eye."
SAM: The rooms are taken care of,

713
00:28:08.274 --> 00:28:10.265
but what of, like, the incidentals?

714
00:28:10.265 --> 00:28:12.231
Are those taken care of also, or?

715
00:28:12.231 --> 00:28:14.844
TALIESIN: Is there a wifi password, is what she's asking?

716
00:28:14.844 --> 00:28:17.269
MATT: "No. If you would like to partake

717
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:20.361
"in the various food items provided,

718
00:28:20.361 --> 00:28:23.116
"you would have to pay separately, but--"

719
00:28:23.116 --> 00:28:24.585
SAM: I won't go crazy.

720
00:28:24.585 --> 00:28:26.502
TALIESIN: Where do we clean up?

721
00:28:27.668 --> 00:28:30.980
I just learned a new word: ichor. Is that what this is?

722
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.996
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: I've had to learn

723
00:28:31.996 --> 00:28:33.725
new words for what happens to me now.

724
00:28:33.725 --> 00:28:35.427
MATT: "You look like you've had quite a day."

725
00:28:35.427 --> 00:28:38.052
TALIESIN: It's been quite a day.

726
00:28:38.052 --> 00:28:40.323
Let's clean up and have a meal, maybe.

727
00:28:40.323 --> 00:28:42.302
TRAVIS: Yeah, that sounds lovely.

728
00:28:42.302 --> 00:28:45.190
MARISHA: I guess we'll all meet down here in the lobby

729
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.678
in what, 30 minutes or so?

730
00:28:46.678 --> 00:28:50.151
SAM: Yeah, realistically more like 45.
MARISHA: Yeah, probably like 45, all right.

731
00:28:50.151 --> 00:28:51.236
Let's go.

732
00:28:51.236 --> 00:28:54.845
MATT: "All right, I'll have the boys
show up to your rooms here.

733
00:28:54.845 --> 00:28:56.894
"Yeeza, Poma!"

734
00:28:56.894 --> 00:28:57.746
TRAVIS: Whoa.

735
00:28:57.746 --> 00:29:00.409
MATT: She just screams out suddenly out amongst the tavern

736
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:01.969
and you hear (quick footsteps),

737
00:29:01.969 --> 00:29:04.037
foots coming down the stairs, and you hear these two,

738
00:29:04.037 --> 00:29:08.031
can't be older than probably 16, dwarf boys

739
00:29:08.031 --> 00:29:09.466
come rushing down, pushing each other out of the way.

740
00:29:09.466 --> 00:29:11.383
"Yes, ma'am?" "Yes, Grandma?

741
00:29:12.293 --> 00:29:15.427
"Oh, hello, we're supposed to show you to your rooms,

742
00:29:15.427 --> 00:29:17.225
"I think, right, right?"

743
00:29:17.225 --> 00:29:20.840
(Kela) "Take the keys and show
them to their various chambers.

744
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.756
"Now! (clapping)"

745
00:29:21.756 --> 00:29:23.157
They're like, "Right!" "Right."

746
00:29:23.157 --> 00:29:25.429
And they grab, "This this way," and they're

747
00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:27.888
not making eye contact with you, they're (grumbling).

748
00:29:27.888 --> 00:29:29.176
TRAVIS: Lead the way.

749
00:29:29.176 --> 00:29:30.257
MATT: They lead you up--

750
00:29:30.257 --> 00:29:32.240
MARISHA: Do we each need our own escort?

751
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.881
This seems excessive.

752
00:29:33.881 --> 00:29:35.758
TRAVIS: Armed what, armed escort, did you say?

753
00:29:35.758 --> 00:29:37.701
Or our rooms?
MARISHA: Keep going.

754
00:29:37.701 --> 00:29:40.004
TRAVIS: Yeah, let them lead on, they're excited.

755
00:29:40.004 --> 00:29:43.475
MATT: The two of them, once they leave the eye

756
00:29:43.475 --> 00:29:45.900
and the sight line and ear shot of the grandma,

757
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.473
their shoulders slump a bit and they just go,

758
00:29:48.473 --> 00:29:50.048
"All right, here's your room, here's your room,

759
00:29:50.048 --> 00:29:51.857
"here's your room," and they just show you around,

760
00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:53.979
getting the job done, baseline what's required.

761
00:29:53.979 --> 00:29:58.217
TRAVIS: Well, hold on. Where did all your enthusiasm go?

762
00:29:58.217 --> 00:30:00.215
Tell us what your names were again.

763
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:01.750
MATT: They look at each other.

764
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.636
"I'm Yeeza," he's like, I'm Poma."

765
00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:05.553
TRAVIS: Pom.

766
00:30:05.553 --> 00:30:06.443
MATT: "Pom<i>a</i>."

767
00:30:06.443 --> 00:30:08.238
TRAVIS: Poma, yes, of course.

768
00:30:08.238 --> 00:30:10.845
My apologies.
SAM: You're her grandkids, then?

769
00:30:10.845 --> 00:30:11.678
MATT: "Yeah."

770
00:30:13.298 --> 00:30:15.847
SAM: Are you compelled to work here?

771
00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:18.619
MATT: "No, does it look like I'm compelled to work here?"

772
00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:20.564
(Marisha laughing)

773
00:30:20.564 --> 00:30:23.456
SAM: Are you just a teenager? Is that what's going on?

774
00:30:23.456 --> 00:30:24.863
MATT: "No!

775
00:30:24.863 --> 00:30:26.086
"I got a full beard."

776
00:30:26.086 --> 00:30:26.919
SAM: Oh!

777
00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:29.525
MATT: It's like scraggly and barely coming through.

778
00:30:29.525 --> 00:30:30.358
SAM: I understand.

779
00:30:30.358 --> 00:30:33.683
MATT: Like the early peach fuzz
that just looks a bit too thin.

780
00:30:33.683 --> 00:30:36.014
TRAVIS: It's quite majestic. Your
grandmother's a wonderful person.

781
00:30:36.014 --> 00:30:39.558
Is there a lot of vacancy here this evening,

782
00:30:39.558 --> 00:30:42.650
or is it fairly full up?

783
00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.550
MATT: "Oh, a few folks left after everything

784
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.492
"that went down earlier today.

785
00:30:47.492 --> 00:30:49.297
"But you know, it's been pretty crowded,

786
00:30:49.297 --> 00:30:50.762
"but we got you rooms, though."

787
00:30:50.762 --> 00:30:52.553
TRAVIS: Oh, no--
MATT: "Is there a problem with the room, sir?"

788
00:30:52.553 --> 00:30:54.513
TRAVIS: I was just curious how loud it is at night.

789
00:30:54.513 --> 00:30:56.996
I'm a fairly light sleeper.

790
00:30:56.996 --> 00:30:57.921
MARISHA: I like him.

791
00:30:57.921 --> 00:30:59.828
MATT: "I'll get you an extra pillow."

792
00:30:59.828 --> 00:31:01.510
TRAVIS: An extra pillow would be great.

793
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.234
Tuck it between my knees, helps align my spine at night.

794
00:31:04.234 --> 00:31:05.537
MATT: "Sure, whatever floats your boat."

795
00:31:05.537 --> 00:31:07.117
TRAVIS: Okay.

796
00:31:07.117 --> 00:31:08.877
MATT: Runs off to grab you another pillow.

797
00:31:08.877 --> 00:31:10.777
The other dwarf's just standing there like,

798
00:31:10.777 --> 00:31:11.985
kicking the ground.

799
00:31:11.985 --> 00:31:13.035
"Need anything else?"

800
00:31:13.035 --> 00:31:17.749
MARISHA: Yeah, do you have, like,
little complimentary soaps?

801
00:31:17.749 --> 00:31:20.445
Some coffee, anything like that?

802
00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:22.319
MATT: "Washroom's at the end of the hall."

803
00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:25.500
MARISHA: Can you give me, like, a handful of free stuff?

804
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.973
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

805
00:31:26.973 --> 00:31:28.517
(laughter)

806
00:31:28.517 --> 00:31:29.617
TALIESIN: Can I give the opposite of, like--

807
00:31:29.617 --> 00:31:31.754
Can I subtract a d4 from this?

808
00:31:31.754 --> 00:31:33.596
TRAVIS: Anti-Bless?
MARISHA: Natural 20.

809
00:31:33.596 --> 00:31:35.282
MATT: You cast Bane on--?

810
00:31:35.282 --> 00:31:36.165
What'd you roll?

811
00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:37.173
MARISHA: Natural 20.

812
00:31:37.173 --> 00:31:38.267
MATT: Natural 20!

813
00:31:38.267 --> 00:31:40.559
MARISHA: Look, I speak punk-ass kid.

814
00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:42.442
MATT: I know you do.

815
00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:44.108
The way you insinuate it, like he can tell

816
00:31:44.108 --> 00:31:46.202
in your vocal timbre, like--

817
00:31:46.202 --> 00:31:48.300
MARISHA: Give me the good shit, man.

818
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.072
MATT: This is probably a fun girl to hang out with.

819
00:31:52.072 --> 00:31:53.563
LIAM: He immediately hands her drugs.

820
00:31:53.563 --> 00:31:56.244
MATT: "I mean, I can probably steal something, right?

821
00:31:56.244 --> 00:31:58.971
"I mean, like you want soap, you said?"

822
00:31:58.971 --> 00:32:01.856
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe those little bottles of booze,

823
00:32:01.856 --> 00:32:04.091
you know, that they give you sometimes?

824
00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:05.438
LIAM: Do they do that, though?

825
00:32:05.438 --> 00:32:06.497
MARISHA: I don't know.

826
00:32:06.497 --> 00:32:07.844
In canon. (laughing)

827
00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:09.267
MATT: "I'll have to ask my grandma."

828
00:32:09.267 --> 00:32:10.329
MARISHA: No, you don't, right?

829
00:32:10.329 --> 00:32:12.772
Why do you have to ask her?
MATT: "I'd have to ask my grandma."

830
00:32:12.772 --> 00:32:14.485
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

831
00:32:14.485 --> 00:32:16.838
TRAVIS: You're going to get these guys killed.

832
00:32:16.838 --> 00:32:18.322
TALIESIN: Don't understand what's happening.

833
00:32:18.322 --> 00:32:19.773
MATT: And he rushes off.

834
00:32:19.773 --> 00:32:20.922
LIAM: Want to join The Mighty Nein?

835
00:32:20.922 --> 00:32:21.989
(laughter)

836
00:32:21.989 --> 00:32:25.182
SAM: Wow! That was cool.

837
00:32:25.182 --> 00:32:26.600
MARISHA: This free shit, you know.

838
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.840
They got that overhead built in, you know?

839
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.584
TALIESIN: Genuinely don't understand what's happening.

840
00:32:30.584 --> 00:32:33.557
SAM: I mean, teenagers don't think anything's cool.

841
00:32:33.557 --> 00:32:36.388
That one thought you were pretty cool.

842
00:32:36.388 --> 00:32:38.219
MARISHA: Yeah, fucking look at me.

843
00:32:38.219 --> 00:32:39.836
I'm covered in fucking blood.

844
00:32:39.836 --> 00:32:42.752
TRAVIS: Speaking of which,
who is the most disgusting amongst us?

845
00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:43.805
Who's up first?

846
00:32:43.805 --> 00:32:45.613
TALIESIN: I got swallowed.

847
00:32:45.613 --> 00:32:49.381
ASHLEY: I haven't had a shower in so many months.

848
00:32:49.381 --> 00:32:52.164
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, really?

849
00:32:52.164 --> 00:32:53.731
ASHLEY: I mean--
TALIESIN: I think you've won first.

850
00:32:53.731 --> 00:32:54.581
SAM: Yeah.

851
00:32:54.581 --> 00:32:56.893
ASHLEY: Oh, I mean, I didn't mean-- I figured--
TALIESIN: (tsking)

852
00:32:56.893 --> 00:32:58.424
Nope, nope.
TRAVIS: Wow, go, please,

853
00:32:58.424 --> 00:33:00.491
for the love of the gods,

854
00:33:00.491 --> 00:33:02.510
get in there.
ASHLEY: Couldn't you tell? (laughing)

855
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.551
MATT: While you're having this conversation,

856
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:06.756
you hear from behind you, "I'm going first!"

857
00:33:06.756 --> 00:33:08.396
and Jester just runs to the washroom.

858
00:33:08.396 --> 00:33:10.001
(laughter)

859
00:33:10.001 --> 00:33:11.461
TRAVIS: That's fair.

860
00:33:11.461 --> 00:33:13.659
TALIESIN: I'm just going to leave
her bag of taffy in her room,

861
00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:16.243
for the next however many hours it takes.

862
00:33:16.243 --> 00:33:18.653
MATT: So four of you guys are facing the front,

863
00:33:18.653 --> 00:33:20.216
in which case as you go into your chambers,

864
00:33:20.216 --> 00:33:21.655
they're very nice chambers.

865
00:33:21.655 --> 00:33:25.335
They're on size pretty similar to like the Pillow Trove

866
00:33:25.335 --> 00:33:28.921
in Zadash, it reminds you of that locale.

867
00:33:28.921 --> 00:33:32.569
The Pillow Trove is lighter as far as the decor

868
00:33:32.569 --> 00:33:34.266
and the sheets, and everything that was placed around here.

869
00:33:34.266 --> 00:33:38.300
This place has more of a earth tones to it.

870
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.405
It feels like it's trying to aim for rustic,

871
00:33:40.405 --> 00:33:41.603
but it's a little too nice for rustic,

872
00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:44.440
so it can't quite find its, you know, its theming.

873
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.593
TALIESIN: Lord Hilton.

874
00:33:45.593 --> 00:33:47.168
MATT: Kind of, yeah!

875
00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:52.013
But aside from a window, there is

876
00:33:52.013 --> 00:33:56.804
a double door, glass door that opens out onto a balcony.

877
00:33:56.804 --> 00:33:58.195
LIAM: On each room, you said?
MATT: On each room,

878
00:33:58.195 --> 00:33:59.486
and the three that are facing

879
00:33:59.486 --> 00:34:02.224
the other direction face out into a garden

880
00:34:02.224 --> 00:34:04.879
that sits in the exterior on the back end

881
00:34:04.879 --> 00:34:05.969
of the actual cottage.

882
00:34:05.969 --> 00:34:08.129
LIAM: Caleb takes a front-facing.

883
00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:09.083
MATT: Okay.

884
00:34:09.083 --> 00:34:10.500
MARISHA: You sure?

885
00:34:11.581 --> 00:34:12.414
LIAM: Yes.

886
00:34:12.414 --> 00:34:14.655
MARISHA: Feels a little exposed, don't you think?

887
00:34:14.655 --> 00:34:15.704
TRAVIS: I'll do it as well.

888
00:34:15.704 --> 00:34:16.999
Take the room next to his.

889
00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:18.891
TALIESIN: Nott, will you take the third room on that side?

890
00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:19.753
SAM: Yes, please.

891
00:34:19.753 --> 00:34:20.875
MARISHA: I'll take the fourth, then.

892
00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:21.847
TALIESIN: Fifth.

893
00:34:21.847 --> 00:34:23.119
SAM: Well, there's only four.

894
00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:24.984
TALIESIN: Oh, only four, I'll be on the other side, then.

895
00:34:24.984 --> 00:34:25.883
(laughter)

896
00:34:25.883 --> 00:34:27.800
SAM: Good decision.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

897
00:34:29.749 --> 00:34:31.166
What's happening?

898
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.907
MATT: You guys choose your individual chambers,

899
00:34:34.907 --> 00:34:39.118
and you can take some time to make the space your own.

900
00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:42.010
But the rest of the evening is yours.

901
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.410
LIAM: For that hour of time, or 45 minutes,

902
00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:47.861
which is really going to be an hour.

903
00:34:47.861 --> 00:34:48.694
SAM: Realistically.

904
00:34:48.694 --> 00:34:51.677
LIAM: Caleb will spend a minute wiping blood off of his face

905
00:34:51.677 --> 00:34:56.677
and then bring up Frumpkin and sit in a chair

906
00:34:56.819 --> 00:34:58.848
and just stare out at the city,

907
00:34:58.848 --> 00:35:03.519
and just scritch Frumpkin, and remember.

908
00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:04.600
MATT: All right.

909
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.109
TALIESIN: Is there a time for short rest in this,

910
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:08.087
or is this not short rest material?

911
00:35:08.087 --> 00:35:10.354
MATT: If you guys are taking about an hour.

912
00:35:10.354 --> 00:35:11.304
(laughs)

913
00:35:11.304 --> 00:35:13.358
TALIESIN: It's going to be an hour,
there will be a shower involved,

914
00:35:13.358 --> 00:35:14.267
or whatever.

915
00:35:14.267 --> 00:35:15.750
MATT: Then yeah, you can take a short rest.
LIAM: When you say an hour,

916
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.487
it's probably more like an hour 15.
TALIESIN: Hour and a half.

917
00:35:17.487 --> 00:35:18.861
MATT: There you go.

918
00:35:18.861 --> 00:35:20.453
MARISHA: Know what, I'll just see you guys at dinner.

919
00:35:20.453 --> 00:35:21.757
TALIESIN: I'll see you at the bar after.

920
00:35:21.757 --> 00:35:23.507
MARISHA: See you at the bar.

921
00:35:24.563 --> 00:35:26.959
MATT: Say 10 and make it our beeswax to be there.

922
00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:28.679
TRAVIS: Oh, beeswax.

923
00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:29.762
TALIESIN: No faffing.

924
00:35:32.468 --> 00:35:33.301
MATT: So.

925
00:35:34.251 --> 00:35:36.021
The hour goes by, those of you that wish

926
00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:40.521
to take a short rest to heal up, hit dice wise, a bit.

927
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.025
TALIESIN: I will also do the same thing for--

928
00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:48.700
MARISHA: Wait, what am I doing?

929
00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.573
LIAM: Jeez.

930
00:35:49.573 --> 00:35:53.131
TALIESIN: Just assume she's rolling the same way I am.

931
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:54.964
LIAM: Worst.
TALIESIN: My own fault.

932
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.168
TRAVIS: Ooh, I get 10.

933
00:36:00.168 --> 00:36:02.004
♪ Hallelujah ♪

934
00:36:02.004 --> 00:36:04.504
(Matt laughs)

935
00:36:07.613 --> 00:36:09.929
SAM: This short rest brought to you by,

936
00:36:11.555 --> 00:36:12.938
I don't know.

937
00:36:13.824 --> 00:36:15.164
MATT: Idle Champions.

938
00:36:15.164 --> 00:36:18.998
SAM: Idle Champions.
MATT: There you go.

939
00:36:18.998 --> 00:36:21.602
SAM: So we meet down for dinner, I assume.

940
00:36:21.602 --> 00:36:22.435
MATT: Mm-hmm.

941
00:36:23.587 --> 00:36:25.679
The meals here are pretty nice.

942
00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:28.204
We'll say, for standard across the board

943
00:36:28.204 --> 00:36:29.912
for the evening's meal and drink,

944
00:36:29.912 --> 00:36:31.899
unless you're providing or asking

945
00:36:31.899 --> 00:36:36.899
for any specific upper shelf alcohol of any kind,

946
00:36:37.022 --> 00:36:40.605
it'll probably put you at about, we'll say,

947
00:36:42.314 --> 00:36:45.979
about six silver a person to eat for the night.

948
00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:46.887
TALIESIN: I'll take that.

949
00:36:46.887 --> 00:36:48.680
SAM: You're going to pay for all of us? Thank you.

950
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.120
TALIESIN: Yeah, how much does that total, then?

951
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.103
Six per person?

952
00:36:51.103 --> 00:36:52.680
SAM: Six times seven.
TALIESIN: Times seven.

953
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.949
LIAM: 42.

954
00:36:53.949 --> 00:36:55.552
TALIESIN: 42 silver.

955
00:36:55.552 --> 00:36:56.877
SAM: That's nothing.

956
00:36:56.877 --> 00:36:59.077
TALIESIN: I'll just put in a gold in for tip.

957
00:36:59.077 --> 00:37:01.369
I'll just do that.

958
00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:03.491
LIAM: We used to con people for silvers.

959
00:37:03.491 --> 00:37:04.324
MATT: All righty.
SAM: It's true.

960
00:37:04.324 --> 00:37:06.774
MARISHA: Are we alone?

961
00:37:06.774 --> 00:37:09.646
Is there anyone else in the restaurant?

962
00:37:09.646 --> 00:37:10.858
MATT: It's not terribly busy.

963
00:37:10.858 --> 00:37:12.274
You see, maybe,

964
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.670
eight other patrons that have come through.

965
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:20.418
You guys definitely stand out amongst a lot of them.

966
00:37:20.418 --> 00:37:23.199
Many of them appear to be very well dressed.

967
00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:27.058
They could be traveling merchants, they could be, you know,

968
00:37:27.058 --> 00:37:29.738
family of nobles that there was no space to stay in.

969
00:37:29.738 --> 00:37:31.500
You're uncertain, but they all look to be

970
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.877
definitely at least a middle or upper class

971
00:37:33.877 --> 00:37:38.404
type presentation, whether or not they actually,

972
00:37:38.404 --> 00:37:40.748
you know, exist and live that lifestyle,

973
00:37:40.748 --> 00:37:44.543
they're definitely presenting as such.

974
00:37:44.543 --> 00:37:48.435
But you don't have quite the spread of dynamic outfits

975
00:37:48.435 --> 00:37:51.167
and figures that your group does.

976
00:37:51.167 --> 00:37:54.100
And so no matter where you sit, you stick out

977
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.917
a little bit, and every time you look up

978
00:37:55.917 --> 00:37:57.500
and look around, there's a few eyes on you.

979
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:02.500
But as is the nature of this type of upper crust

980
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.610
social experience, as soon as

981
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:08.008
that eye connection happens, (clearing throat).

982
00:38:08.008 --> 00:38:10.242
TALIESIN: Is anybody giving us a <i>funny</i> funny look,

983
00:38:10.242 --> 00:38:11.208
or is it just--
LIAM: Yeah, by a check

984
00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:13.345
of the room, is anybody--

985
00:38:13.345 --> 00:38:14.743
SAM: See Invisibility.

986
00:38:14.743 --> 00:38:16.497
LIAM: Paying too much attention?

987
00:38:16.497 --> 00:38:18.497
MATT: Make an insight check.

988
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.337
TALIESIN: 19.

989
00:38:22.337 --> 00:38:24.420
LIAM: Hmm.

990
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.453
16.

991
00:38:26.816 --> 00:38:28.243
MATT: All right.

992
00:38:28.243 --> 00:38:30.722
You do see one person that is dressed

993
00:38:30.722 --> 00:38:33.753
in nice traveling attire

994
00:38:33.753 --> 00:38:38.745
with a bit of an under set of basic leather armor.

995
00:38:38.745 --> 00:38:41.738
But the kind you see people who are willing,

996
00:38:41.738 --> 00:38:44.646
or taking long trips along trade routes

997
00:38:44.646 --> 00:38:48.119
and main roads to where, and they've pretty much

998
00:38:48.119 --> 00:38:52.172
been eating alone and just keeping an eye on you.

999
00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:53.172
TALIESIN: All right.

1000
00:38:54.939 --> 00:38:56.090
SAM: So.

1001
00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.892
TRAVIS: It's so hard to feel like
you belong in places like this.

1002
00:38:58.892 --> 00:39:00.878
I always feel like I'm pretending.

1003
00:39:00.878 --> 00:39:02.007
MARISHA: What, fancy places?

1004
00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:04.123
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, agreed.

1005
00:39:05.761 --> 00:39:06.594
SAM: Yasha.

1006
00:39:08.049 --> 00:39:09.623
ASHLEY: Yeah?

1007
00:39:09.623 --> 00:39:11.706
SAM: Did you take your bath?

1008
00:39:12.794 --> 00:39:13.627
ASHLEY: Yes.

1009
00:39:13.627 --> 00:39:14.976
SAM: Because this thing's still there.

1010
00:39:14.976 --> 00:39:18.304
Is that, it's always there?

1011
00:39:18.304 --> 00:39:19.284
ASHLEY: This is a tattoo.

1012
00:39:19.284 --> 00:39:22.741
SAM: Oh, I just thought that-- I don't know what I thought,

1013
00:39:22.741 --> 00:39:23.977
I just--
TRAVIS: She was a messy eater?

1014
00:39:23.977 --> 00:39:25.875
SAM: Yeah, maybe.
TRAVIS: Oh.

1015
00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:27.916
SAM: Like a coffee stain or something?

1016
00:39:27.916 --> 00:39:31.858
ASHLEY: No, that's just a part of my face.

1017
00:39:31.858 --> 00:39:34.525
(laughter)

1018
00:39:35.436 --> 00:39:36.685
I made it a part of my face.

1019
00:39:36.685 --> 00:39:38.948
SAM: Oh, okay.
ASHLEY: I wasn't born that way.

1020
00:39:38.948 --> 00:39:43.948
SAM: Hey, welcome back to Yasha, I guess, right?

1021
00:39:44.312 --> 00:39:45.145
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1022
00:39:46.014 --> 00:39:48.461
It feels weird to, just this morning

1023
00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:51.286
I was not fully myself,

1024
00:39:52.744 --> 00:39:55.048
and now I am.

1025
00:39:55.048 --> 00:39:58.772
SAM: And you got revenge for the one who did this to you,

1026
00:39:58.772 --> 00:40:00.772
which was pretty badass.

1027
00:40:01.997 --> 00:40:06.542
ASHLEY: I don't know if that's
the word I would use, but, yes.

1028
00:40:06.542 --> 00:40:08.709
MARISHA: Wait, revenge or badass?

1029
00:40:09.815 --> 00:40:11.902
ASHLEY: Badass, I guess, and revenge.

1030
00:40:11.902 --> 00:40:13.031
All of it.

1031
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:15.117
MARISHA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Doesn't feel that way?

1032
00:40:15.117 --> 00:40:16.534
ASHLEY: It feels weird.

1033
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:22.152
It feels like it's not finished,

1034
00:40:22.152 --> 00:40:25.735
and part of it feels like it wasn't enough.

1035
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:29.136
(Ashley sighs)

1036
00:40:29.136 --> 00:40:33.013
LIAM: Well, I don't think 12 hours are going to roll back

1037
00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:36.771
months of pain.

1038
00:40:37.844 --> 00:40:40.844
ASHLEY: I think you might be right, Caleb.

1039
00:40:42.308 --> 00:40:45.858
SAM: Do you think he's gone? Obann, for real?

1040
00:40:47.537 --> 00:40:48.645
ASHLEY: It seemed like it.

1041
00:40:48.645 --> 00:40:53.119
I mean, I think if someone is goopy,

1042
00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:55.362
maybe they're gone.

1043
00:40:55.362 --> 00:40:57.445
TRAVIS: Seems like that he might be.

1044
00:40:58.514 --> 00:41:00.192
MARISHA: (gasps) Ooh!

1045
00:41:00.192 --> 00:41:03.005
TALIESIN: Finally Jester comes down.
LIAM: Wow, you really took a shower.

1046
00:41:03.005 --> 00:41:05.050
MATT: Talk about making an appearance.

1047
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.219
LAURA: Yeah!
SAM: Oh my god.

1048
00:41:06.219 --> 00:41:07.808
LIAM: Wow.
LAURA: Hi, buddies.

1049
00:41:07.808 --> 00:41:08.674
MATT: Hey, Laura.

1050
00:41:08.674 --> 00:41:11.718
LIAM: Why didn't we all bathe upstairs?

1051
00:41:11.718 --> 00:41:13.858
ASHLEY: Only one of us bathed.

1052
00:41:13.858 --> 00:41:15.851
LAURA: Hi.
SAM: I'm married to that!

1053
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:17.514
Oh wait, no, I'm not.
LAURA: Oh wait.

1054
00:41:17.514 --> 00:41:19.044
(laughter)

1055
00:41:19.044 --> 00:41:20.575
TRAVIS: Hi.
LAURA: Hi, baby.

1056
00:41:20.575 --> 00:41:22.477
TRAVIS: You look beautiful.
LAURA: Thank you.

1057
00:41:22.477 --> 00:41:24.243
LIAM: Aww.

1058
00:41:25.277 --> 00:41:27.060
LAURA: Hi.
SAM: Did you win?

1059
00:41:28.474 --> 00:41:30.132
LAURA: They haven't announced my category.

1060
00:41:30.132 --> 00:41:31.945
SAM: You just left?!

1061
00:41:31.945 --> 00:41:34.005
You just left before your category?

1062
00:41:34.005 --> 00:41:37.204
LAURA: Well, I saw on Twitter that you were using my dice.

1063
00:41:37.204 --> 00:41:38.704
SAM: I wasn't using your dice!

1064
00:41:38.704 --> 00:41:39.937
LAURA: Somebody said my dice

1065
00:41:39.937 --> 00:41:41.103
was in front of you--
SAM: That's a joke, I would never

1066
00:41:41.103 --> 00:41:43.191
touch your dice without you here.
LAURA: Well, I had to come.

1067
00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:44.827
TRAVIS: How did you get here so fast?

1068
00:41:44.827 --> 00:41:46.409
LAURA: Dude, there was no traffic.

1069
00:41:46.409 --> 00:41:47.711
It was so weird.
MATT: Priorities.

1070
00:41:47.711 --> 00:41:49.319
SAM: If, for your your category--
MATT: I love it.

1071
00:41:49.319 --> 00:41:50.810
LIAM and MATT: Respect.

1072
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:52.716
SAM: For your category, will you just go back real quick?

1073
00:41:52.716 --> 00:41:53.971
LAURA: Yeah, I'm just going to go.

1074
00:41:53.971 --> 00:41:56.577
Like, so let me know, chat room, if I win.

1075
00:41:56.577 --> 00:41:58.123
(laughter)

1076
00:41:58.123 --> 00:41:59.587
SAM: The music will just be playing.

1077
00:41:59.587 --> 00:42:01.355
MARISHA: Yeah, if you win, you have to give it--

1078
00:42:01.355 --> 00:42:03.671
LAURA: I went to the bathroom.

1079
00:42:03.671 --> 00:42:05.254
I did, though, and then I--

1080
00:42:05.254 --> 00:42:06.600
MATT: It's okay, as long as nobody knows

1081
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.830
and there's no proof that you--
LAURA: There's no way that you'll know.

1082
00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.901
LIAM: We could just film an acceptance speech on an iPhone.

1083
00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:12.746
We'll just send it over.

1084
00:42:12.746 --> 00:42:14.307
SAM: iPhone? We're broadcasting live;

1085
00:42:14.307 --> 00:42:16.049
she could do an acceptance speech live.

1086
00:42:16.049 --> 00:42:17.921
LAURA: If I win, I'll give an acceptance speech here.

1087
00:42:17.921 --> 00:42:19.621
For sure.
MATT: With a slight delay.

1088
00:42:19.621 --> 00:42:20.454
LAURA: Yeah.

1089
00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:21.287
(laughter)

1090
00:42:21.287 --> 00:42:24.044
SAM: I think we all admire your priorities.

1091
00:42:24.044 --> 00:42:26.599
TALIESIN: Seriously, not even kidding.

1092
00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:27.454
LAURA: I love you guys.

1093
00:42:27.454 --> 00:42:28.801
MATT: We love you, too.

1094
00:42:28.801 --> 00:42:30.089
TRAVIS: We were just talking to Yasha about

1095
00:42:30.089 --> 00:42:33.908
how it's to be free in the last few months.

1096
00:42:33.908 --> 00:42:36.610
MARISHA: We basically showered and now we're having dinner.

1097
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:37.761
LAURA: Oh.

1098
00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:39.872
I'm so glad I'm clean now.

1099
00:42:39.872 --> 00:42:42.539
(laughter)

1100
00:42:44.282 --> 00:42:46.750
LIAM: We are the Camarouth Cottage.

1101
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.244
LAURA: Yes, obviously.
LIAM: Squaring things away.

1102
00:42:49.244 --> 00:42:51.795
SAM: And Yasha was explaining that she has

1103
00:42:51.795 --> 00:42:54.483
some mild sort of PTSD.

1104
00:42:54.483 --> 00:42:57.179
MARISHA: Talking to Jester like she just came out of a coma.

1105
00:42:57.179 --> 00:43:00.623
LAURA: I don't remember anything that just happened.

1106
00:43:00.623 --> 00:43:04.302
TRAVIS: Yasha, I meant to ask, since it has been months,

1107
00:43:04.302 --> 00:43:07.028
is there anything that you need to do?

1108
00:43:07.028 --> 00:43:10.528
Anyone you need to notify or follow up on?

1109
00:43:16.139 --> 00:43:17.529
ASHLEY: No.

1110
00:43:17.529 --> 00:43:19.093
TRAVIS: Oh.
ASHLEY: I think

1111
00:43:19.093 --> 00:43:23.108
the only people that I

1112
00:43:23.108 --> 00:43:28.058
would've need to have notified are you guys and Molly, so,

1113
00:43:29.246 --> 00:43:31.538
that's just you guys.

1114
00:43:32.484 --> 00:43:36.088
SAM: Well, even before all this began, you know,

1115
00:43:36.088 --> 00:43:39.983
sometimes you would stare out into the night

1116
00:43:39.983 --> 00:43:42.998
and yearn to be somewhere else.

1117
00:43:42.998 --> 00:43:45.310
Is that still part of your MO?

1118
00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:47.913
Like, are you going to disappear tomorrow morning?

1119
00:43:47.913 --> 00:43:50.133
TRAVIS: Is it raining right now?

1120
00:43:50.133 --> 00:43:52.034
MATT: It is, yeah. Faintly.

1121
00:43:52.034 --> 00:43:55.476
It's not as strong as it was earlier today.

1122
00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.445
ASHLEY: I don't know. I mean,

1123
00:43:59.895 --> 00:44:03.287
I feel like I just, we'll see if I can feel

1124
00:44:03.287 --> 00:44:04.615
a little more--

1125
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.524
I don't know, I feel like nowhere feels like home,

1126
00:44:11.524 --> 00:44:15.274
so, at least not yet, maybe that will change.

1127
00:44:16.765 --> 00:44:20.290
MARISHA: We have a great keep in Xhorhouse-- Xhorhas.

1128
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.693
We call it the Xhorhaus.

1129
00:44:21.693 --> 00:44:25.306
TRAVIS: ♪ Xhorhaus, in the middle of the ♪

1130
00:44:25.306 --> 00:44:28.380
ASHLEY: I haven't seen the mural in a while, and--

1131
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.873
LAURA: Yeah.

1132
00:44:29.873 --> 00:44:32.744
ASHLEY: I haven't slept in a bed in a while,

1133
00:44:32.744 --> 00:44:34.337
so that's going to be weird.

1134
00:44:34.337 --> 00:44:37.754
LAURA: Where did you sleep when you were with?

1135
00:44:39.231 --> 00:44:40.311
Did you even sleep?

1136
00:44:40.311 --> 00:44:42.028
You had camp, we spied on you.

1137
00:44:42.028 --> 00:44:44.319
ASHLEY: Yeah, just a lot of, you know,

1138
00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:46.395
sleeping on the ground, which I guess I'm used to anyway,

1139
00:44:46.395 --> 00:44:48.202
more so than sleeping in a bed.

1140
00:44:48.202 --> 00:44:51.389
MARISHA: What was sleeping like
when you were under his control?

1141
00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:53.039
LAURA: Did you dream as yourself?

1142
00:44:53.039 --> 00:44:54.213
MARISHA: Yeah.

1143
00:44:54.213 --> 00:44:55.213
ASHLEY: I did.

1144
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.782
I feel like sometimes when I was sleeping,

1145
00:44:59.782 --> 00:45:02.270
that was the only time where I felt like myself,

1146
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.103
which is weird, because,

1147
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:11.784
you know, my dreams would
come through, or it just felt like,

1148
00:45:11.784 --> 00:45:14.451
I felt like I was me for a while.

1149
00:45:17.207 --> 00:45:18.248
Anyway.

1150
00:45:19.278 --> 00:45:21.308
TRAVIS: It's good to have you back.

1151
00:45:21.308 --> 00:45:23.003
ASHLEY: It's good to be back.

1152
00:45:23.003 --> 00:45:23.836
Oh!

1153
00:45:25.753 --> 00:45:27.703
I forgot.

1154
00:45:30.263 --> 00:45:32.596
I'm going to take out 500 gold.

1155
00:45:35.823 --> 00:45:38.865
You let me borrow this one time,

1156
00:45:38.865 --> 00:45:40.483
and I said I was going to pay you back,

1157
00:45:40.483 --> 00:45:43.866
but I didn't get a chance to.

1158
00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:44.965
So--

1159
00:45:44.965 --> 00:45:48.367
TRAVIS: But that was for your bracers, wasn't it?

1160
00:45:48.367 --> 00:45:50.617
ASHLEY: Yeah, but we'll see what--

1161
00:45:50.617 --> 00:45:52.992
still, you let me borrow a $500.

1162
00:45:52.992 --> 00:45:55.178
500 gold, I mean.

1163
00:45:55.178 --> 00:45:56.630
I don't know what dollars are.

1164
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.238
TALIESIN: About one gold.

1165
00:45:58.238 --> 00:45:59.071
TRAVIS: Keep it.

1166
00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:02.178
We've been earning a fair amount of money in your absence.

1167
00:46:02.178 --> 00:46:05.567
ASHLEY: I would feel uncomfortable if you didn't take it.

1168
00:46:05.567 --> 00:46:07.567
TRAVIS: I will take the money.

1169
00:46:08.983 --> 00:46:09.864
Thank you.

1170
00:46:09.864 --> 00:46:11.902
SAM: Dinner's on Fjord.

1171
00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:13.908
LAURA: Yay!

1172
00:46:13.908 --> 00:46:16.687
TRAVIS: I tell you what, because I feel strange

1173
00:46:16.687 --> 00:46:18.478
taking 500 gold from someone that's been

1174
00:46:18.478 --> 00:46:21.167
mind controlled for several months.

1175
00:46:21.167 --> 00:46:24.750
How about I'll give you a gift in exchange?

1176
00:46:27.011 --> 00:46:31.752
And I will take out the book that Caleb gave me

1177
00:46:31.752 --> 00:46:33.330
and I will hand it to Yasha.

1178
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:34.163
MATT: Ah.

1179
00:46:34.163 --> 00:46:35.413
SAM: What's that? What's that book?

1180
00:46:35.413 --> 00:46:36.491
LAURA: Oh shit.

1181
00:46:36.491 --> 00:46:37.474
ASHLEY: What is this book?

1182
00:46:37.474 --> 00:46:39.149
LAURA: It's a really good book, Yasha.

1183
00:46:39.149 --> 00:46:40.457
SAM: Is that Tusk Love?
ASHLEY: What is it?

1184
00:46:40.457 --> 00:46:42.741
TRAVIS: Just give it a look before you go to sleep.

1185
00:46:42.741 --> 00:46:44.849
ASHLEY: It's a good book. Is it like a--

1186
00:46:44.849 --> 00:46:46.601
is there sexy times in it?

1187
00:46:46.601 --> 00:46:47.851
LAURA: I don't know.

1188
00:46:48.819 --> 00:46:51.480
LIAM: No, but it is right up your alley.

1189
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.005
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: It's a good choice.

1190
00:46:53.005 --> 00:46:53.838
MARISHA: We do have a good

1191
00:46:53.838 --> 00:46:54.671
sexy time book.
LAURA: We could make

1192
00:46:54.671 --> 00:46:55.754
sexy times in it.

1193
00:46:55.754 --> 00:46:57.425
We could put whatever we want to.

1194
00:46:57.425 --> 00:46:58.500
ASHLEY: Maybe like add something

1195
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.938
on the side of the lines.
TRAVIS: Hmm, I don't know if you want to do that.

1196
00:47:01.938 --> 00:47:04.945
SAM: Add the words "in bed" to the end of the sentence.

1197
00:47:04.945 --> 00:47:05.984
LAURA: Yeah, that's really good.

1198
00:47:05.984 --> 00:47:07.445
ASHLEY: That is very kind of you, Fjord.

1199
00:47:07.445 --> 00:47:10.770
I really, I mean, I do like to read, so.

1200
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:15.063
But it's such a short book.

1201
00:47:15.063 --> 00:47:16.530
It's so small.

1202
00:47:17.688 --> 00:47:19.271
MARISHA: It's a flip book.

1203
00:47:20.459 --> 00:47:25.459
SAM: Well, should we start discussing what we're going to do

1204
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:30.941
with the whole getting the realms to talk to each other

1205
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:33.060
and everything?
LAURA: World peace and--

1206
00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.977
TALIESIN: I don't know if this is the time or place

1207
00:47:35.977 --> 00:47:37.770
to do that right now.

1208
00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.293
LAURA: What, do you have something in your eyeball?

1209
00:47:40.293 --> 00:47:44.715
TALIESIN: I have a thing in my eyeball, yeah.

1210
00:47:44.715 --> 00:47:46.513
LIAM: I recommend we take a bottle of something

1211
00:47:46.513 --> 00:47:49.312
up to one of our rooms and discuss it.

1212
00:47:49.312 --> 00:47:51.922
MARISHA: Those punk-ass kids
should be bringing me something.

1213
00:47:51.922 --> 00:47:53.668
SAM: Oh.

1214
00:47:53.668 --> 00:47:56.788
MARISHA: It better be fucking good.

1215
00:47:56.788 --> 00:47:57.834
LAURA: What, what?

1216
00:47:57.834 --> 00:48:01.818
SAM: Oh, while you were bathing, we met some teens,

1217
00:48:01.818 --> 00:48:06.197
some sullen teens, and Beau hit it off with them

1218
00:48:06.197 --> 00:48:07.051
really great.

1219
00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:07.884
MARISHA: Yeah, they're pretty cool.

1220
00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:09.637
They were very refreshing, actually.

1221
00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:11.694
SAM: They said that they would steal something

1222
00:48:11.694 --> 00:48:13.906
from the hotel for her.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1223
00:48:13.906 --> 00:48:15.455
LAURA: Anything in particular?

1224
00:48:15.455 --> 00:48:18.003
SAM: They didn't specify, but she asked for booze.
MARISHA: I asked for good shit.

1225
00:48:18.003 --> 00:48:19.672
LAURA: Oh, nice.

1226
00:48:19.672 --> 00:48:20.730
MARISHA: Yeah.

1227
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.266
Kind of to challenge them a little bit.

1228
00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.935
You know, it was like, "How cool are you,

1229
00:48:23.935 --> 00:48:24.829
"you know, man?"

1230
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:28.835
It's really good tactic for manipulating young people.

1231
00:48:28.835 --> 00:48:30.574
LAURA: If they succeed and they're really good

1232
00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:33.099
are you going to get them into the the--

1233
00:48:33.099 --> 00:48:34.587
SAM: The cool party?

1234
00:48:34.587 --> 00:48:38.752
LAURA: No, like, you can make them a monk or something.

1235
00:48:38.752 --> 00:48:39.735
TALIESIN: I'm conflicted on

1236
00:48:39.735 --> 00:48:41.876
how proud I'm supposed to be about this.

1237
00:48:42.928 --> 00:48:45.838
Having a very difficult time gauging.

1238
00:48:45.838 --> 00:48:46.973
ASHLEY: It was almost as if you were, like,

1239
00:48:46.973 --> 00:48:49.729
speaking a different language to each other,

1240
00:48:49.729 --> 00:48:50.944
and I couldn't understand.

1241
00:48:50.944 --> 00:48:53.002
It was like, lots of words were

1242
00:48:53.002 --> 00:48:54.335
missing in sentences.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just wanted to chase you

1243
00:48:54.335 --> 00:48:56.506
off of my front yard or something.

1244
00:48:56.506 --> 00:48:58.316
MARISHA: Basically, just, like, kind of get rid

1245
00:48:58.316 --> 00:49:00.054
of all consonants and just, like,

1246
00:49:00.054 --> 00:49:01.762
blur a lot of shit together.

1247
00:49:01.762 --> 00:49:03.143
(laughter)

1248
00:49:03.143 --> 00:49:05.343
ASHLEY, MARISHA, and LAURA: Yeah.

1249
00:49:06.249 --> 00:49:08.227
TRAVIS: Fluent.

1250
00:49:08.227 --> 00:49:09.880
LAURA: I'm uncomfortable.

1251
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.274
SAM: Did you bring some sweatpants?

1252
00:49:11.274 --> 00:49:12.265
LAURA: I wish.

1253
00:49:12.265 --> 00:49:14.165
(Matt chuckling)

1254
00:49:14.165 --> 00:49:15.533
TALIESIN: May have some-- oh, well.

1255
00:49:15.533 --> 00:49:16.744
MATT: At the break, just run to Target.

1256
00:49:16.744 --> 00:49:19.271
LAURA: Yeah, maybe I'll just run to Target.

1257
00:49:19.271 --> 00:49:20.379
TRAVIS: Caleb.

1258
00:49:21.862 --> 00:49:24.709
Haven't really had a moment to gauge your feelings

1259
00:49:24.709 --> 00:49:26.722
about how all of that went.

1260
00:49:26.722 --> 00:49:31.492
He called you by your real name.

1261
00:49:31.492 --> 00:49:33.911
LIAM: Why don't we go up to my room?

1262
00:49:33.911 --> 00:49:34.787
All of us.

1263
00:49:34.787 --> 00:49:36.439
TRAVIS: Sure.

1264
00:49:36.439 --> 00:49:40.526
I will cast See Invisi-- nope, I don't have that.

1265
00:49:40.526 --> 00:49:41.458
We haven't rested.

1266
00:49:41.458 --> 00:49:45.795
Oh, I took a short rest, See Invisibility!

1267
00:49:45.795 --> 00:49:48.561
MATT: Does that come back on a short rest?

1268
00:49:48.561 --> 00:49:49.866
TRAVIS: It does not.

1269
00:49:49.866 --> 00:49:52.532
MATT: So you do not cast it.
TRAVIS: So I do this stupid hand gesture

1270
00:49:52.532 --> 00:49:54.288
and pretend like something happens.

1271
00:49:54.288 --> 00:49:55.129
MATT: Okay.

1272
00:49:55.129 --> 00:49:57.911
(Travis gasping)
(Matt laughing)

1273
00:49:57.911 --> 00:49:58.818
TRAVIS: Okay.

1274
00:49:58.818 --> 00:50:00.875
MATT: You guys are following Caleb to his room?

1275
00:50:00.875 --> 00:50:02.351
SAM: Yes.

1276
00:50:02.351 --> 00:50:03.759
Oh no.
TRAVIS: Fucking damn.

1277
00:50:03.759 --> 00:50:05.050
LAURA: What?

1278
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:07.027
SAM: Jester was just robbed of something.

1279
00:50:07.027 --> 00:50:08.766
LAURA: No, I wasn't, stop.
SAM: She was robbed!

1280
00:50:08.766 --> 00:50:09.785
LAURA: No, I wasn't.

1281
00:50:09.785 --> 00:50:12.446
SAM: Someone else got the thing that she should have gotten.

1282
00:50:12.446 --> 00:50:14.502
LAURA: No. (laughing)
ASHLEY: No.

1283
00:50:14.502 --> 00:50:17.542
LAURA: That's good, that's real good, you guys.

1284
00:50:17.542 --> 00:50:19.582
It would have been real bad.
TRAVIS: What's the name of this thief?

1285
00:50:19.582 --> 00:50:21.440
SAM: Some sort of mad person.

1286
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.741
TRAVIS: A mad person?

1287
00:50:22.741 --> 00:50:24.338
(laughter)

1288
00:50:24.338 --> 00:50:25.645
LIAM: It would have been real bad.

1289
00:50:25.645 --> 00:50:27.358
LAURA: It would've been real bad.

1290
00:50:27.358 --> 00:50:30.479
Yeah. So it's probably for the best.

1291
00:50:30.479 --> 00:50:32.715
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I can't believe you.

1292
00:50:32.715 --> 00:50:34.234
LIAM: A calculated risk you took.

1293
00:50:34.234 --> 00:50:36.286
(laughter)

1294
00:50:36.286 --> 00:50:38.375
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah.

1295
00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:39.723
TRAVIS: There would've been much pooping in that chair.

1296
00:50:39.723 --> 00:50:42.727
LAURA: Yeah. Ooh! Oh no!

1297
00:50:42.727 --> 00:50:44.441
LIAM: Not that dress. (strains)

1298
00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:46.767
SAM: It's like the end of The Sound of Music,

1299
00:50:46.767 --> 00:50:49.258
where "The family Von Trapp!

1300
00:50:49.258 --> 00:50:51.329
"The family Von Trapp!"

1301
00:50:51.329 --> 00:50:53.245
(laughter)

1302
00:50:53.245 --> 00:50:54.472
"The Von Trapp family!

1303
00:50:54.472 --> 00:50:55.782
"No?"

1304
00:50:55.782 --> 00:50:57.932
MATT: It does fuck up Mads coming for the second half

1305
00:50:57.932 --> 00:50:59.807
as Trent. That was my plan.

1306
00:50:59.807 --> 00:51:02.287
(groaning and laughter)
Plans are fucked up now on that.

1307
00:51:02.287 --> 00:51:04.108
TRAVIS: You said it out loud, Matt.
MATT: I know.

1308
00:51:04.108 --> 00:51:06.062
TRAVIS: You said it out loud. You know what happens when you

1309
00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:07.812
say things out loud.
MATT: I know, stop making wishes.

1310
00:51:07.812 --> 00:51:09.345
They have a tendency to come true these days

1311
00:51:09.345 --> 00:51:10.777
in a very Monkey Paw way.

1312
00:51:10.777 --> 00:51:12.912
TALIESIN: Curse you, Monkey Paw.

1313
00:51:12.912 --> 00:51:16.489
MATT: You guys go ahead and follow Caleb up to his chambers,

1314
00:51:16.489 --> 00:51:18.311
and spacious room.

1315
00:51:18.311 --> 00:51:20.019
Each room is slightly different and has

1316
00:51:20.019 --> 00:51:24.413
its own personality, though it is generally similar.

1317
00:51:24.413 --> 00:51:26.121
You all go into the chamber,

1318
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:28.767
close the door behind you, and you're fairly certain

1319
00:51:28.767 --> 00:51:31.435
you have some element of privacy.

1320
00:51:32.783 --> 00:51:35.295
LIAM: We have a lot to talk about.

1321
00:51:35.295 --> 00:51:38.620
LAURA: Should we search the room for like, you know,

1322
00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.892
people spying on us and stuff?
TRAVIS: I'll use Divine Sense

1323
00:51:40.892 --> 00:51:43.191
and see if there's anything around.

1324
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:44.127
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Boop.

1325
00:51:44.127 --> 00:51:46.008
MATT: You concentrate for a moment and

1326
00:51:46.008 --> 00:51:48.751
extend your senses.

1327
00:51:48.751 --> 00:51:50.561
You know, as you focus, you can smell.

1328
00:51:50.561 --> 00:51:54.303
The normally perfumed interior of the room

1329
00:51:54.303 --> 00:51:57.659
fades to the smell of a fresh breeze

1330
00:51:57.659 --> 00:52:00.611
and an earthy scent as you feel the Wildmother

1331
00:52:00.611 --> 00:52:03.814
expanding your consciousness into the space.

1332
00:52:03.814 --> 00:52:06.690
You don't pick up anything fiendish or anything undead.

1333
00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.223
LIAM: I'll also just-- go ahead.

1334
00:52:08.223 --> 00:52:09.244
TALIESIN: No, you go first.

1335
00:52:09.244 --> 00:52:10.766
LIAM: Just eyeball the room, make sure

1336
00:52:10.766 --> 00:52:12.914
that I don't see anything.
MATT: Perception check please.

1337
00:52:12.914 --> 00:52:15.292
TALISEIN: I'll use a Detect Magic once the doors are closed,

1338
00:52:15.292 --> 00:52:18.841
just to keep an eye on everything to go look around,

1339
00:52:18.841 --> 00:52:21.581
see if anything's giving me an itch.

1340
00:52:21.581 --> 00:52:22.797
MATT: Okay.

1341
00:52:22.797 --> 00:52:23.779
What'd you roll?

1342
00:52:23.779 --> 00:52:24.724
LIAM: Just an eight.

1343
00:52:24.724 --> 00:52:25.630
MATT: An eight.

1344
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:28.521
Glancing on the chamber, it looks like a standard chamber.

1345
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:29.625
You cast Detect Magic.

1346
00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:31.387
Aside from all of you guys that just

1347
00:52:31.387 --> 00:52:33.849
glow like Christmas trees.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1348
00:52:33.849 --> 00:52:36.644
MATT: There is the oil lantern, the oil lamp

1349
00:52:36.644 --> 00:52:38.335
that's over by the bed that is the central

1350
00:52:38.335 --> 00:52:40.814
source of light in the room, does have its own glow.

1351
00:52:40.814 --> 00:52:43.459
As you approach and look over at it,

1352
00:52:43.459 --> 00:52:45.985
you can see that it is not an actual flame,

1353
00:52:45.985 --> 00:52:49.836
it is a small glowing orb, it is a magical lamp.

1354
00:52:49.836 --> 00:52:51.167
LIAM: Actually, just a quick look around

1355
00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:52.074
is not good enough for me.

1356
00:52:52.074 --> 00:52:55.182
I'm going to take 10 minutes to methodically

1357
00:52:55.182 --> 00:52:56.959
search this room for anything.

1358
00:52:56.959 --> 00:52:59.203
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

1359
00:52:59.203 --> 00:53:01.861
SAM: Seeing him do that, I will also assist in that.

1360
00:53:01.861 --> 00:53:04.191
TALIESIN: If I turn off the light, does it continue to have

1361
00:53:04.191 --> 00:53:05.770
a Detect Magic-- yeah, no, that wouldn't change anything,

1362
00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.053
never mind.

1363
00:53:07.053 --> 00:53:09.859
TRAVIS: Is he always like this when he prepares to sleep?

1364
00:53:09.859 --> 00:53:13.820
SAM: Yeah, we haven't been in a lot of hotels, so, you know,

1365
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.303
he just wants to make sure that he knows

1366
00:53:15.303 --> 00:53:16.494
where to fold the clothes

1367
00:53:16.494 --> 00:53:18.219
and where the extra robe is.
MATT: What'd you roll? LIAM: 25.

1368
00:53:18.219 --> 00:53:19.052
TRAVIS: He likes to unpack?
LAURA: I'm going to

1369
00:53:19.052 --> 00:53:20.855
jump on the bed while they're doing it.
LIAM: Caleb is like--

1370
00:53:20.855 --> 00:53:23.010
Oh, Caleb's arm just got caught under the mattress

1371
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:24.164
as he was searching it.

1372
00:53:24.164 --> 00:53:25.970
LAURA: Sorry.
SAM: Oh!

1373
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:27.410
LAURA: Hold on, let me jump up.

1374
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:28.297
There you go.

1375
00:53:28.297 --> 00:53:31.636
(laughter)

1376
00:53:31.636 --> 00:53:35.398
MATT: Going around the chambers, they seem fairly devoid

1377
00:53:35.398 --> 00:53:38.582
of any specific traps or dangerous implements.

1378
00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:40.539
TRAVIS: Is there a chair in the room?

1379
00:53:40.539 --> 00:53:41.778
(laughter)

1380
00:53:41.778 --> 00:53:42.611
MATT: There is.

1381
00:53:42.611 --> 00:53:43.444
LAURA: Oh no!

1382
00:53:43.444 --> 00:53:44.756
TRAVIS: Kill it with fire.

1383
00:53:44.756 --> 00:53:46.147
MARISHA: (slamming)
TRAVIS: Okay!

1384
00:53:46.147 --> 00:53:47.799
That'll come out of our--
MARISHA: No, I don't do that.

1385
00:53:47.799 --> 00:53:49.598
LIAM: (fireball explosion)

1386
00:53:50.439 --> 00:53:52.161
TRAVIS: Fireball.

1387
00:53:52.161 --> 00:53:55.176
(laughter)

1388
00:53:55.176 --> 00:53:58.034
LIAM: The roof erupts out on the street.

1389
00:54:00.416 --> 00:54:05.118
MATT: That would turn the campaign
in a very weird direction.

1390
00:54:05.118 --> 00:54:06.531
Yeah, the room seems relatively safe.

1391
00:54:06.531 --> 00:54:08.496
It is the wonderful Caleb experience

1392
00:54:08.496 --> 00:54:09.607
of everyone rushing into the room going,

1393
00:54:09.607 --> 00:54:11.753
"Okay, so Caleb, what's going on?"

1394
00:54:11.753 --> 00:54:14.004
10 minutes of him circling the room as you all just like--

1395
00:54:14.004 --> 00:54:15.156
TRAVIS: (whistling)
LAURA: (humming)

1396
00:54:15.156 --> 00:54:16.664
TALIESIN: Welcome back.
LIAM: Very on brand.

1397
00:54:16.664 --> 00:54:17.497
LAURA and MATT: Yeah.

1398
00:54:17.497 --> 00:54:20.305
SAM: Well, now that that's settled,

1399
00:54:20.305 --> 00:54:21.379
what's our play here?

1400
00:54:21.379 --> 00:54:25.369
Do we do we go across, do we go-- Where can we teleport?

1401
00:54:25.369 --> 00:54:28.725
We can't teleport to Xhorhas, can we?

1402
00:54:28.725 --> 00:54:29.721
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, we can.

1403
00:54:29.721 --> 00:54:31.571
LIAM: We could go to the Dynasty.
SAM: We can?

1404
00:54:31.571 --> 00:54:33.823
Yes, we can.
MARISHA: We can.

1405
00:54:33.823 --> 00:54:35.669
SAM: But to what end?

1406
00:54:35.669 --> 00:54:36.793
We just walk in and say,

1407
00:54:36.793 --> 00:54:39.427
"Hey, King Dwendal wants to talk to you."

1408
00:54:39.427 --> 00:54:40.800
LIAM: Well, we're getting ahead of--

1409
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.748
I don't even know where to begin.

1410
00:54:42.748 --> 00:54:45.814
We have a meeting with the Martinet tomorrow, yeah, correct.

1411
00:54:45.814 --> 00:54:48.260
They have some idea of what they want to do.

1412
00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:52.466
I don't know if they're going to be open to a counter idea.

1413
00:54:52.466 --> 00:54:54.342
MARISHA: Are we going to get access to this beacon?

1414
00:54:54.342 --> 00:54:57.867
What if the whole thing is, like, a red herring

1415
00:54:57.867 --> 00:55:00.194
or Trojan horse or a fake?

1416
00:55:00.194 --> 00:55:02.368
LAURA: What if the beacon is, like, trapped or something,

1417
00:55:02.368 --> 00:55:04.770
and they're waiting, they've like done something to it

1418
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:08.256
so the minute that goes back to the Dynasty, it explodes

1419
00:55:08.256 --> 00:55:09.711
in the Bright Queen's--
MARISHA: Absolutely.

1420
00:55:09.711 --> 00:55:11.344
SAM: We're not taking it back to the Dynasty.

1421
00:55:11.344 --> 00:55:14.749
This is a upon successful meeting, right?

1422
00:55:14.749 --> 00:55:16.309
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure, we're supposed to broker

1423
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:17.972
some sort of meeting between the two.

1424
00:55:17.972 --> 00:55:20.226
Did not establish on this ground or theirs,

1425
00:55:20.226 --> 00:55:21.429
neutral or otherwise.

1426
00:55:21.429 --> 00:55:25.136
This is entirely rigged to be a trap.

1427
00:55:25.136 --> 00:55:26.467
TALIESIN: Hmm.

1428
00:55:26.467 --> 00:55:29.021
MARISHA: We have to get-- huh?
LAURA: Hmm?

1429
00:55:29.021 --> 00:55:32.305
LIAM: I was agreeing with Fjord.

1430
00:55:32.305 --> 00:55:33.691
SAM: You said we were meeting with the Martinet.

1431
00:55:33.691 --> 00:55:35.906
I thought we were supposed to be meeting with

1432
00:55:35.906 --> 00:55:37.175
Trent Ikithon, no?

1433
00:55:37.175 --> 00:55:39.766
LIAM: No, Martinet.
TRAVIS: Da'leth.

1434
00:55:39.766 --> 00:55:41.274
SAM: Oh, sorry.
LIAM: Da'leth, yes.

1435
00:55:41.274 --> 00:55:42.758
SAM: Oh, okay.
LIAM: The head of the Assembly.

1436
00:55:42.758 --> 00:55:45.348
TRAVIS: Speaking of Trent, he did see Caleb.

1437
00:55:45.348 --> 00:55:47.842
He called him by his real name.

1438
00:55:47.842 --> 00:55:51.684
He seemed very calm about that.

1439
00:55:51.684 --> 00:55:53.800
How do you feel?

1440
00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.066
What do you want to do?

1441
00:55:55.066 --> 00:55:58.373
Are we going through with this?

1442
00:55:58.373 --> 00:56:02.206
LIAM: You know, I have spent a long time imagining

1443
00:56:03.472 --> 00:56:07.746
how seeing him again would go,

1444
00:56:07.746 --> 00:56:11.212
and I did not imagine...

1445
00:56:11.212 --> 00:56:12.203
that.

1446
00:56:14.544 --> 00:56:15.860
(nervous laugh)

1447
00:56:16.821 --> 00:56:20.421
I spent years avoiding... that,

1448
00:56:21.313 --> 00:56:23.004
and we just walked in.

1449
00:56:26.557 --> 00:56:30.548
I-I-I have imagined choking the life from that man

1450
00:56:31.548 --> 00:56:32.739
a lot,

1451
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:36.934
and I think we need to work with him?

1452
00:56:38.352 --> 00:56:40.185
SAM: Will you be able to?

1453
00:56:42.939 --> 00:56:45.700
ASHLEY: I am not comfortable with that idea,

1454
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.617
knowing how that feels.

1455
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:49.984
But--

1456
00:56:49.984 --> 00:56:53.768
LIAM: Well, there is a lot at stake right now,

1457
00:56:53.768 --> 00:56:57.018
and we are surrounded by an entire city

1458
00:56:58.987 --> 00:57:01.987
of armed guards and the king's will.

1459
00:57:03.417 --> 00:57:04.829
But I don't know what to believe.

1460
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:07.204
They said that they just found this beacon.

1461
00:57:07.204 --> 00:57:10.244
We know that that is almost certainly horse shit.

1462
00:57:10.244 --> 00:57:13.828
They did not just find a beacon.

1463
00:57:17.974 --> 00:57:19.425
It's hard to know who knows what.

1464
00:57:19.425 --> 00:57:22.578
It's hard to know if the King knows what the Assembly knows.

1465
00:57:22.578 --> 00:57:24.271
It's hard to know what the Assembly knows.

1466
00:57:24.271 --> 00:57:25.104
MARISHA: Absolutely.

1467
00:57:25.104 --> 00:57:28.736
LIAM: I don't know what

1468
00:57:28.736 --> 00:57:30.461
Ikithon's intentions are.

1469
00:57:31.575 --> 00:57:36.158
I don't know if they are in unison within the Assembly.

1470
00:57:38.047 --> 00:57:40.984
MARISHA: Hmm.
LIAM: It's hard to feel safe here.

1471
00:57:40.984 --> 00:57:42.817
TALIESIN: It is hard to feel safe here.

1472
00:57:42.817 --> 00:57:44.809
MARISHA: Well, we're not safe here.

1473
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:48.267
TRAVIS: There is something to be said for playing the game,

1474
00:57:48.267 --> 00:57:50.800
taking this a few pieces down the road.

1475
00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.966
LIAM: I honestly don't think we have much other choice.

1476
00:57:53.966 --> 00:57:55.732
MARISHA: We've done it successfully before.

1477
00:57:55.732 --> 00:57:57.240
We did it in Xhorhas.

1478
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:59.372
Now we have to do it again.

1479
00:57:59.372 --> 00:58:01.157
LIAM: And what other option is there?

1480
00:58:01.157 --> 00:58:04.292
We will end up in a prison cell, or dead.

1481
00:58:04.292 --> 00:58:06.742
TALIESIN: Considering how the last 24 hours went,

1482
00:58:06.742 --> 00:58:09.629
I feel pretty comfortable saying
if he looks at you sideways,

1483
00:58:09.629 --> 00:58:12.663
we will not leave enough of him to be found.

1484
00:58:15.908 --> 00:58:16.938
MARISHA: We have to work--

1485
00:58:16.938 --> 00:58:18.770
LAURA: We could just do that, we could just kill him,

1486
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:20.630
chop him up into little tiny pieces,

1487
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.690
and then we escape to Xhorhas and we never come back!

1488
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:25.869
TALIESIN: I suppose what I meant is--
LAURA: Here.

1489
00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:28.472
TALIESIN: We're going to try and keep you safe,

1490
00:58:28.472 --> 00:58:31.635
and I think we can, is what I meant.

1491
00:58:31.635 --> 00:58:32.754
LAURA: Oh.

1492
00:58:32.754 --> 00:58:35.566
TALIESIN: I mean, but we could do, you know.

1493
00:58:35.566 --> 00:58:37.190
TRAVIS: Wow.
TALIESIN: I'm not against that, either.

1494
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.857
LIAM: Caleb is flashing back to the boat

1495
00:58:39.857 --> 00:58:42.596
when Jester just sunk an axe into a dude's head.

1496
00:58:42.596 --> 00:58:44.787
MATT: Yep. And he just screamed.

1497
00:58:46.407 --> 00:58:47.240
MARISHA: Hmm.

1498
00:58:48.682 --> 00:58:51.549
We do have Jester's option,

1499
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:54.524
worst case scenario.
SAM: Sounds pretty dangerous.

1500
00:58:54.524 --> 00:58:58.441
LIAM: I appreciate both sentiments, honestly, but

1501
00:58:59.516 --> 00:59:02.536
we don't know what circumstances we're dealing with yet,

1502
00:59:02.536 --> 00:59:05.518
and he is certainly not alone.

1503
00:59:05.518 --> 00:59:09.350
Just the one man is very powerful,

1504
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:12.812
and he has a network of people.

1505
00:59:12.812 --> 00:59:13.946
TALIESIN: Our goal is going to be getting you

1506
00:59:13.946 --> 00:59:15.779
out of this city no matter what, though.

1507
00:59:15.779 --> 00:59:17.889
As long as you know that, that that's really

1508
00:59:17.889 --> 00:59:21.430
beyond anything, at least for me, is to make sure that

1509
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:25.982
you're not ending here, under any circumstances.

1510
00:59:25.982 --> 00:59:30.481
SAM: I guess one question I had,

1511
00:59:30.481 --> 00:59:32.446
Lebby, is,

1512
00:59:32.446 --> 00:59:36.860
aside from rendezvousing with the Martinet

1513
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.234
and figuring out how we're going to get out of here

1514
00:59:40.234 --> 00:59:43.252
and what we're going to do in the grand scheme of things.

1515
00:59:43.252 --> 00:59:47.523
Is there anything else in Rexxentrum that you want to know,

1516
00:59:47.523 --> 00:59:52.523
you want to see, you want to visit while we're here?

1517
00:59:52.534 --> 00:59:55.175
We have safe passage through the city,

1518
00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:57.472
something that we've never had before.

1519
00:59:57.472 --> 01:00:00.722
Even a check-in, a pass by, a drive-by?

1520
01:00:06.048 --> 01:00:07.715
We could go for you.

1521
01:00:11.104 --> 01:00:13.604
LIAM: I'll think about it tonight.

1522
01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.927
MARISHA: Depending on what we hear from the Martinet,

1523
01:00:17.927 --> 01:00:21.721
we might be on a tight timetable, though.

1524
01:00:21.721 --> 01:00:25.396
TALIESIN: We're going to need to know a lot.

1525
01:00:26.488 --> 01:00:28.256
Even if it's not the truth, we're at least

1526
01:00:28.256 --> 01:00:31.249
going to need to know what lie they want to tell.

1527
01:00:31.249 --> 01:00:33.341
Where it came from, how they found it,

1528
01:00:33.341 --> 01:00:35.961
what it would take to make this end on their end,

1529
01:00:35.961 --> 01:00:40.461
what would be the things they would want to stop this.

1530
01:00:41.591 --> 01:00:45.767
LIAM: What I fear is we go to this meeting tomorrow

1531
01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:50.767
and hear them out and hear what their intention is.

1532
01:00:51.533 --> 01:00:53.179
Cannot take it at face value.

1533
01:00:53.179 --> 01:00:54.012
TALIESIN: No.

1534
01:00:54.012 --> 01:00:58.366
LIAM: We also probably cannot turn it down.

1535
01:00:58.366 --> 01:01:01.199
TALIESIN: And I doubt that the
Bright Queen will be so foolish

1536
01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:03.525
as to take it at face value either,

1537
01:01:03.525 --> 01:01:08.525
and she'll understand that we're telling her what we heard.

1538
01:01:08.776 --> 01:01:10.133
LAURA: Will she?

1539
01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.129
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1540
01:01:11.129 --> 01:01:12.629
SAM: Yes, and she won't be foolish enough

1541
01:01:12.629 --> 01:01:14.736
to just meet with someone face to face.

1542
01:01:14.736 --> 01:01:16.723
She might astral project herself

1543
01:01:16.723 --> 01:01:17.886
into the meeting or something.

1544
01:01:17.886 --> 01:01:18.782
LAURA: She can do that?

1545
01:01:18.782 --> 01:01:20.941
SAM: I don't know, she can live a million years.

1546
01:01:20.941 --> 01:01:23.593
TRAVIS: I would remind us all that the last time

1547
01:01:23.593 --> 01:01:26.391
we were in Xhorhas, we were being watched.

1548
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:31.310
I would assume that was by someone in the Dynasty, not here.

1549
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:35.277
So if they were watching while we were in that room.

1550
01:01:35.277 --> 01:01:37.264
LAURA: They already know everything.

1551
01:01:37.264 --> 01:01:38.873
TRAVIS: Could be.

1552
01:01:38.873 --> 01:01:43.248
LIAM: It might not be a bad idea to, Jester,

1553
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.781
to contact one of our friends there.

1554
01:01:47.781 --> 01:01:49.493
LAURA: The Bright Queen?

1555
01:01:49.493 --> 01:01:51.714
LIAM: Yes, or Essek.

1556
01:01:51.714 --> 01:01:53.753
LAURA: That's what I said. Oh boy.

1557
01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:58.237
LIAM: And they are not going to trust the Empire

1558
01:01:58.237 --> 01:01:59.937
at face value either.

1559
01:01:59.937 --> 01:02:03.362
But at least for our own

1560
01:02:03.362 --> 01:02:05.537
standing with them,

1561
01:02:05.537 --> 01:02:08.659
to appear to be on the up and up with them.

1562
01:02:08.659 --> 01:02:13.275
LAURA: So what would I say, like, what would I say?

1563
01:02:13.275 --> 01:02:14.309
TRAVIS: To Essek?

1564
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:15.558
LAURA: Yeah. Like:

1565
01:02:15.558 --> 01:02:20.558
Hey, we met with King Dwendal,

1566
01:02:20.734 --> 01:02:24.210
they say they have a beacon and they want to make peace.

1567
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:28.029
Do you guys want to meet up with them maybe? Coffee?

1568
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:29.747
TALIESIN: I think that that might be too much.

1569
01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:34.063
I even would just say we are, through circumstances,

1570
01:02:34.063 --> 01:02:38.017
meeting with the Empire, we'll let you know in person.

1571
01:02:38.017 --> 01:02:39.771
MARISHA: I don't know if we want to put

1572
01:02:39.771 --> 01:02:43.468
any of this through a Sending spell.

1573
01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:46.705
This seems like a thing that can be misconstrued with--

1574
01:02:46.705 --> 01:02:48.123
TALIESIN: We need to do this in person.

1575
01:02:48.123 --> 01:02:50.516
MARISHA: 25 words.

1576
01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:52.769
LAURA: I could send multiple Sending messages.

1577
01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.850
TRAVIS: Wouldn't it be great
if we could meet Essek somewhere

1578
01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:58.474
that's not all the way in the Dynasty?

1579
01:02:58.474 --> 01:02:59.863
He's quite powerful.

1580
01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:02.949
Perhaps if we said we have a lead on that item

1581
01:03:02.949 --> 01:03:06.053
that you asked us to track down, could we meet somewhere?

1582
01:03:06.053 --> 01:03:09.352
LAURA: Somewhere neutral, like Traveler Con.

1583
01:03:09.352 --> 01:03:11.647
TRAVIS: We are not in the Dynasty anymore.

1584
01:03:11.647 --> 01:03:12.807
TALIESIN: Or on the way.

1585
01:03:12.807 --> 01:03:16.251
MARISHA: Well, why don't we go back to...

1586
01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:19.487
♪ The cold mountain town where the elves were ♪

1587
01:03:19.487 --> 01:03:21.012
♪ Where we met Reani ♪
MATT: Uthodurn?

1588
01:03:21.012 --> 01:03:22.170
MARISHA: Uthodurn.

1589
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:25.004
LAURA: Oh, we do have a way to transport there.

1590
01:03:25.004 --> 01:03:27.742
TALIESIN: Uthodurn or--
MATT: You do.

1591
01:03:27.742 --> 01:03:30.632
LIAM: Yeah, however, if we show up tomorrow,

1592
01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:32.684
there is no guarantee that they're not just going to

1593
01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:37.684
march us off to whatever their means of transportation is.

1594
01:03:37.707 --> 01:03:39.500
We have no idea what is going to happen

1595
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.792
once we walk through that door and begin that conversation.

1596
01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:45.713
MARISHA: We're just meeting with the Martinet, right?

1597
01:03:45.713 --> 01:03:48.496
It's just him?
LIAM: The most

1598
01:03:48.496 --> 01:03:52.138
powerful mage in the Empire.

1599
01:03:52.138 --> 01:03:54.389
TALIESIN: If their plan had been
to imprison us and kill us--

1600
01:03:54.389 --> 01:03:55.445
SAM: They would've done it already.

1601
01:03:55.445 --> 01:03:58.006
TALIESIN: Two hours ago would have
been an amazing time to do it.

1602
01:03:58.006 --> 01:04:00.092
TRAVIS: We need to be emphatic.

1603
01:04:00.092 --> 01:04:02.499
LIAM: I'm not saying they're going to drop us on the spot,

1604
01:04:02.499 --> 01:04:05.691
but we are going to start moving on a path

1605
01:04:05.691 --> 01:04:09.324
that we might not fully approve of.

1606
01:04:09.324 --> 01:04:10.903
TRAVIS: I think we're all of the same mind, though,

1607
01:04:10.903 --> 01:04:12.259
that we should try and fight that.

1608
01:04:12.259 --> 01:04:15.189
Implore them, educate them on why that

1609
01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:17.329
is not the best way to reach their goal, yes?

1610
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:18.975
MARISHA: I think Fjord's right here.

1611
01:04:18.975 --> 01:04:22.233
Like, beyond what King Dwendal said of

1612
01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:25.402
us standing on the boundaries of being traitors.

1613
01:04:25.402 --> 01:04:27.393
I think we have to steer this.

1614
01:04:27.393 --> 01:04:29.149
TRAVIS: And certainly, it might not be our choice.

1615
01:04:29.149 --> 01:04:30.722
I know what Caleb is getting at, but I think

1616
01:04:30.722 --> 01:04:34.718
we should try every resource we have.

1617
01:04:34.718 --> 01:04:36.972
LIAM: I just don't think that we should show up

1618
01:04:36.972 --> 01:04:40.897
with the Empire, with no

1619
01:04:40.897 --> 01:04:42.322
advanced warning to them.

1620
01:04:42.322 --> 01:04:43.680
MARISHA: No, not at all.

1621
01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.989
TALIESIN: No, we need to go by ourselves.

1622
01:04:44.989 --> 01:04:49.280
MARISHA: We would go by ourselves and confer with Essek.

1623
01:04:51.146 --> 01:04:53.056
LIAM: If that's what they approve.

1624
01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.079
MARISHA: Well, that's what we were talking about, though.

1625
01:04:55.079 --> 01:04:58.657
We're going to have to have some ultimatums,

1626
01:04:58.657 --> 01:05:00.133
or else this isn't going to work.

1627
01:05:00.133 --> 01:05:02.033
LAURA: What if we give them the ultimatum

1628
01:05:02.033 --> 01:05:04.570
and they're like, "No,"

1629
01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:06.949
and then they're like, "Do it right now the way we say,

1630
01:05:06.949 --> 01:05:08.140
"or you all die?"

1631
01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.223
TRAVIS: You go with these two people and they will take you.

1632
01:05:11.223 --> 01:05:12.739
TALIESIN: Then we--
LAURA: Yeah, what do we do?

1633
01:05:12.739 --> 01:05:14.039
SAM: Do we have any bargaining chips?

1634
01:05:14.039 --> 01:05:17.655
LAURA: Ooh, what if they try to do that,

1635
01:05:17.655 --> 01:05:20.407
and instead of taking them to Xhorhas,

1636
01:05:20.407 --> 01:05:23.623
we can just, you just make a circle

1637
01:05:23.623 --> 01:05:26.146
to go somewhere else that we know,

1638
01:05:26.146 --> 01:05:27.596
and then the minute we get there,

1639
01:05:27.596 --> 01:05:28.991
we ditch them.
SAM: We kill them.

1640
01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:31.005
LAURA: Or we cut them up into tiny pieces.

1641
01:05:31.005 --> 01:05:32.455
TALIESIN: Or we just leave.
SAM: Just a couple guards,

1642
01:05:32.455 --> 01:05:33.772
in our hypothetical.

1643
01:05:33.772 --> 01:05:36.234
TALIESIN: I can totally see how I am partly responsible

1644
01:05:36.234 --> 01:05:38.568
for this current mode of thinking.

1645
01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:40.681
MARISHA: Look, it's going to be a negotiation,

1646
01:05:40.681 --> 01:05:41.944
it's a discussion, right?

1647
01:05:41.944 --> 01:05:43.760
I just think we just,

1648
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.211
we don't go over as pushovers, right?

1649
01:05:47.211 --> 01:05:48.064
TRAVIS: Agreed.

1650
01:05:48.064 --> 01:05:50.221
MARISHA: So, okay.

1651
01:05:50.221 --> 01:05:52.650
Maybe we need to have some hard lines.

1652
01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:54.832
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Things we won't budge on.

1653
01:05:54.832 --> 01:05:55.981
You know?
LAURA: One!

1654
01:05:55.981 --> 01:05:58.740
SAM: We're not going anywhere today.

1655
01:05:58.740 --> 01:05:59.573
LAURA: Two!

1656
01:05:59.573 --> 01:06:01.377
TRAVIS: We're not going supervised.

1657
01:06:01.377 --> 01:06:02.210
LAURA: Three!

1658
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:04.562
MARISHA: We are not going until we see the beacon

1659
01:06:04.562 --> 01:06:06.123
ourselves in person.

1660
01:06:06.123 --> 01:06:08.030
LAURA: Oh, that's a big one, that's a really big one.

1661
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.194
SAM: That's a big ask.

1662
01:06:09.194 --> 01:06:11.609
MARISHA: We have no proof that they
actually fucking have it!

1663
01:06:11.609 --> 01:06:12.797
LAURA: That's true.
TRAVIS: I like it, I like it.

1664
01:06:12.797 --> 01:06:13.871
LAURA: Four!

1665
01:06:13.871 --> 01:06:17.638
TALIESIN: We're also going to want
to know what they actually want.

1666
01:06:17.638 --> 01:06:21.023
What kind of demands, even if we're not going to be

1667
01:06:21.023 --> 01:06:23.549
representing them, we need to know

1668
01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:26.133
that they actually want something.

1669
01:06:26.133 --> 01:06:27.082
If they don't want something,

1670
01:06:27.082 --> 01:06:28.143
what's the point of doing this?

1671
01:06:28.143 --> 01:06:29.764
They want an end to the war, what does that mean?

1672
01:06:29.764 --> 01:06:30.740
What do they want out of it?

1673
01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.760
What kind of guarantee?
LAURA: I feel like that one's a squiggly line.

1674
01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.704
That's less of a hard line. It's like

1675
01:06:34.704 --> 01:06:36.529
an up and down kind of,

1676
01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:40.103
but it's definitely--
TRAVIS: Jester, how about 1000 platinum.

1677
01:06:40.103 --> 01:06:41.863
LAURA: Five: 1000 platinum.
TRAVIS: Yep!

1678
01:06:41.863 --> 01:06:42.838
SAM and LAURA: Six!

1679
01:06:42.838 --> 01:06:45.630
SAM: They should cover incidentals at our hotel.

1680
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:46.809
I'm just saying.
LAURA: Totally.

1681
01:06:46.809 --> 01:06:50.935
Seven, also like, do the have--
SAM: Yasha, do you want anything?

1682
01:06:50.935 --> 01:06:53.099
I mean, we're just asking for stuff now.
ASHLEY: Wait, but I--

1683
01:06:53.099 --> 01:06:54.674
SAM: Chocolate?
ASHLEY: Because it's--

1684
01:06:54.674 --> 01:06:57.712
Well, yeah, I like chocolate, so that should

1685
01:06:57.712 --> 01:06:59.703
definitely be high on the list.
LAURA: Okay, seven is chocolate.

1686
01:06:59.703 --> 01:07:01.300
Eight is--
TRAVIS: What about--

1687
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.354
SAM: These are lower priority.
MARISHA: I feel like I need to write this down.

1688
01:07:03.354 --> 01:07:05.757
TRAVIS: What about some armaments?

1689
01:07:05.757 --> 01:07:08.063
What if they have some--
ASHLEY and LAURA: Almond mints?

1690
01:07:08.063 --> 01:07:09.962
TRAVIS: (stammering) Armaments.

1691
01:07:09.962 --> 01:07:10.828
TALIESIN: Almond mints?

1692
01:07:10.828 --> 01:07:11.920
SAM: But we're not going into battle.

1693
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.878
ASHLEY: Like Andes mints?
TRAVIS: Are we not?

1694
01:07:13.878 --> 01:07:17.526
Are we not engaging on dangerous business for the Empire?

1695
01:07:17.526 --> 01:07:20.446
Perhaps they have some items and things

1696
01:07:20.446 --> 01:07:22.511
that might help us in our quest.

1697
01:07:22.511 --> 01:07:24.132
LAURA: I'm losing track of the numbers.
MATT: (knocking)

1698
01:07:24.132 --> 01:07:25.297
TALIESIN: We may, oh.

1699
01:07:25.297 --> 01:07:27.437
ASHLEY: I have a question, because it is--

1700
01:07:27.437 --> 01:07:28.998
MARISHA: Wait, was that a knock at the door?

1701
01:07:28.998 --> 01:07:31.638
MATT: Caduceus and Beauregard, you hear a knock,

1702
01:07:31.638 --> 01:07:34.448
but it's not at this door, it's at two doors down.

1703
01:07:34.448 --> 01:07:36.226
MARISHA: Oh shit, it's my kids, it's my delivery.

1704
01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:38.059
I'll be right back, I'll be right back.

1705
01:07:38.059 --> 01:07:39.870
TRAVIS: No, it's not, is it?
(laughter)

1706
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.421
MARISHA: No wait, I just, I peek out the door.

1707
01:07:42.421 --> 01:07:44.136
MATT: You peek out, and you see the dwarf kid

1708
01:07:44.136 --> 01:07:45.934
you spoke to earlier is like down at your room

1709
01:07:45.934 --> 01:07:48.294
going like--
TRAVIS: Sup, sup bro.

1710
01:07:48.294 --> 01:07:52.198
MARISHA: Hey, psst, psst.

1711
01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:53.031
MATT: Comes over.
MARISHA: Wait!

1712
01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:55.756
Shh shh, stop right there.

1713
01:07:55.756 --> 01:07:56.603
Go, just--

1714
01:07:56.603 --> 01:07:58.687
MATT: He drops this little bag on the ground.

1715
01:07:58.687 --> 01:08:00.375
(Sam laughing)
MARISHA: Yeah.

1716
01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:03.358
MATT: And then just heads off downstairs.

1717
01:08:06.555 --> 01:08:07.830
MARISHA: (quick footsteps)

1718
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.244
TRAVIS: It's full of poop.

1719
01:08:09.244 --> 01:08:10.325
MARISHA: Yeah, what is it? Before I--

1720
01:08:10.325 --> 01:08:11.860
Is it full of poop?
LAURA: Oh, it's another poop bag!

1721
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:15.005
MATT: A tiny square glass vial with a cork in it.

1722
01:08:15.005 --> 01:08:17.313
It's like a dark brown glass.

1723
01:08:17.313 --> 01:08:18.554
LAURA: What the shit is that?

1724
01:08:18.554 --> 01:08:21.621
TRAVIS: He poured out his dad's bourbon stash.

1725
01:08:21.621 --> 01:08:24.725
MATT: It's his grandma's special personal liquor.

1726
01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:26.350
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh!

1727
01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:29.040
TRAVIS: In a perfume bottle.

1728
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.561
MATT: It's some strong dwarven shit.

1729
01:08:30.561 --> 01:08:31.928
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. (laughing)

1730
01:08:31.928 --> 01:08:33.539
MARISHA: Oh yeah, it's the good shit.

1731
01:08:33.539 --> 01:08:34.689
Oh yeah.
SAM: Give me some of that!

1732
01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:38.681
MARISHA: Just a sip, do not-- you're going to go last.

1733
01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:41.440
LAURA: I don't want, thank you.

1734
01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.982
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course, yeah.

1735
01:08:42.982 --> 01:08:45.028
(coughs)
MATT: (knocking)

1736
01:08:45.028 --> 01:08:46.120
There's a knock on the door.

1737
01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.377
SAM: Uh-oh.

1738
01:08:47.377 --> 01:08:49.211
LAURA: Which one, ours?
TRAVIS: Tell the fucking kids to go away.

1739
01:08:49.211 --> 01:08:50.655
We're trying to collaborate here.

1740
01:08:50.655 --> 01:08:53.008
MARISHA: Does it sound like the--
SAM: Oh, I ordered room service.

1741
01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:54.613
MARISHA: Did it sound like the same knock?

1742
01:08:54.613 --> 01:08:55.446
MATT: It did.

1743
01:08:55.446 --> 01:08:56.437
LAURA: Who is it?

1744
01:08:57.931 --> 01:08:59.167
MATT: No response.

1745
01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:01.055
MARISHA: I peek it open.

1746
01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:01.951
MATT: "Hey.

1747
01:09:01.951 --> 01:09:05.314
"Sorry to bother you.

1748
01:09:05.314 --> 01:09:09.306
"I noticed you work for the Cobalt Soul."

1749
01:09:09.306 --> 01:09:10.329
MARISHA: Yeah, man.

1750
01:09:10.329 --> 01:09:11.267
Yeah, I do, what's up?

1751
01:09:11.267 --> 01:09:12.139
MATT: "That's pretty cool."

1752
01:09:12.139 --> 01:09:12.972
MARISHA: Yeah.

1753
01:09:12.972 --> 01:09:14.405
Yeah, it is.

1754
01:09:14.405 --> 01:09:16.310
TRAVIS: Do you want to go to prom?

1755
01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:19.544
(laughter)

1756
01:09:19.544 --> 01:09:22.202
MATT: "Anyway, I did you a favor."

1757
01:09:24.052 --> 01:09:25.052
MARISHA: All right.

1758
01:09:25.935 --> 01:09:28.110
MATT: "Bye." Leaves.

1759
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:29.066
MARISHA: Hey, man.

1760
01:09:29.066 --> 01:09:30.153
MATT: "What?"

1761
01:09:30.153 --> 01:09:31.648
(laughter)

1762
01:09:31.648 --> 01:09:34.414
MARISHA: For your trouble, this is--

1763
01:09:34.414 --> 01:09:37.178
This is official Cobalt Soul sanctioned shit.

1764
01:09:37.178 --> 01:09:40.365
I could get in trouble if any of these are caught

1765
01:09:40.365 --> 01:09:43.502
outside of the hands of any of the members

1766
01:09:43.502 --> 01:09:44.634
of the Cobalt Soul, all right?

1767
01:09:44.634 --> 01:09:46.675
So don't fucking get in trouble with this, all right?

1768
01:09:46.675 --> 01:09:48.406
MATT: "All right."

1769
01:09:48.406 --> 01:09:50.823
MARISHA: And I just give him a couple of my ninja stars.

1770
01:09:50.823 --> 01:09:51.938
(laughter)

1771
01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:54.656
MATT: You watch his face go...

1772
01:09:54.656 --> 01:09:56.764
MARISHA: Don't fucking, don't, dude,

1773
01:09:56.764 --> 01:09:58.691
be fucking cool, man.
MATT: Like hides them, and is like (winces)

1774
01:09:58.691 --> 01:10:00.605
you notice like accidentally stab himself with one already,

1775
01:10:00.605 --> 01:10:01.812
and is like (whimpers).

1776
01:10:01.812 --> 01:10:03.314
MARISHA: Also, don't fucking hurt yourself, man,

1777
01:10:03.314 --> 01:10:04.203
I can't be responsible.

1778
01:10:04.203 --> 01:10:05.411
MATT: "No, I didn't hurt myself, it's fine, it's cool.

1779
01:10:05.411 --> 01:10:06.252
"It's cool."

1780
01:10:06.252 --> 01:10:07.826
MARISHA: All right.
TRAVIS: You're going to get them killed.

1781
01:10:07.826 --> 01:10:08.987
TALIESIN: A year from now, we're going to come back,

1782
01:10:08.987 --> 01:10:10.375
the other kid's going to have an eye patch.

1783
01:10:10.375 --> 01:10:13.487
(laughter)

1784
01:10:13.487 --> 01:10:16.040
MATT: And he scrambles off.

1785
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.972
LIAM: Was that a reenactment of the first time

1786
01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:19.346
Matt and Marisha met?

1787
01:10:19.346 --> 01:10:20.663
(laughter)
MATT: Practically.

1788
01:10:20.663 --> 01:10:21.528
Practically.

1789
01:10:21.528 --> 01:10:22.518
(laughter)

1790
01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:24.235
TRAVIS: Hey, be cool, be cool.

1791
01:10:24.235 --> 01:10:26.290
LIAM: She gave you some ninja stars.

1792
01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:28.233
MATT: That's when I knew.

1793
01:10:28.233 --> 01:10:29.830
That's when I knew.

1794
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:31.635
TRAVIS: (as Matt) Were you just carrying those?

1795
01:10:31.635 --> 01:10:33.882
(as Marisha) Be cool, man.

1796
01:10:33.882 --> 01:10:35.234
MATT: Look, man, she grew up on the streets.

1797
01:10:35.234 --> 01:10:37.521
She knows how to keep herself safe.

1798
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:39.579
MARISHA: Those Kentucky streets.

1799
01:10:39.579 --> 01:10:41.778
Those dirt and gravel streets.

1800
01:10:41.778 --> 01:10:42.994
MATT: Oh, don't tell me you didn't know kids

1801
01:10:42.994 --> 01:10:45.040
in your Kentucky high school who carried ninja stars.

1802
01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.910
MARISHA: Oh man, are you kidding?
TRAVIS: Butterfly knives.

1803
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:47.743
MATT: Yeah.

1804
01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.263
MARISHA: That's a lot of boredom.

1805
01:10:49.263 --> 01:10:50.870
MATT: Yeah, oh, I know.

1806
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:55.370
Anyway, the kid rushes off, excited, slightly in pain.

1807
01:10:56.803 --> 01:10:58.869
MARISHA: Fucking piece of shit kids, all right.

1808
01:10:58.869 --> 01:11:01.619
(Laura laughing)

1809
01:11:02.464 --> 01:11:04.556
Okay, hang on, I was writing--
LAURA: We were on nine.

1810
01:11:04.556 --> 01:11:08.481
ASHLEY: It's been a little bit of time, but

1811
01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:11.177
whose side are you on?

1812
01:11:11.177 --> 01:11:12.920
SAM: Oh.
MARISHA: That's a good point.

1813
01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.553
TRAVIS: You mean us, collectively?

1814
01:11:15.553 --> 01:11:17.666
SAM: We've been playing both sides in order

1815
01:11:17.666 --> 01:11:20.503
to achieve peace, actually.

1816
01:11:20.503 --> 01:11:22.284
LAURA: That's said really well.
TRAVIS: The Dynasty has

1817
01:11:22.284 --> 01:11:23.521
quite a war they're waging

1818
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:26.872
against the Empire, and the same is true for the other side.

1819
01:11:26.872 --> 01:11:29.037
This is actually the first instance of the Empire

1820
01:11:29.037 --> 01:11:31.306
at least pretending like they want to find

1821
01:11:31.306 --> 01:11:34.055
some way to a truce.

1822
01:11:34.055 --> 01:11:37.140
LAURA: Because the Dynasty is like, fuck them.

1823
01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.032
It's going to be real hard.

1824
01:11:38.032 --> 01:11:39.433
TRAVIS: We have been given these little medallions

1825
01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:42.601
that allow us to move amongst the Dynasty,

1826
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:45.745
similarly to how we are here.

1827
01:11:45.745 --> 01:11:48.571
SAM: And in all fairness, this gentleman we're meeting with,

1828
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:52.179
the Martinet, seems to be

1829
01:11:52.179 --> 01:11:54.053
on the more trustworthy side

1830
01:11:54.053 --> 01:11:56.530
of the spectrum, right?

1831
01:11:56.530 --> 01:11:57.987
Ludinus?

1832
01:11:57.987 --> 01:11:58.902
TALIESIN: We'll see.
LAURA: Maybe.

1833
01:11:58.902 --> 01:12:01.576
SAM: I mean, his own assistant was betraying him,

1834
01:12:01.576 --> 01:12:03.851
he seemed genuinely surprised.

1835
01:12:03.851 --> 01:12:05.089
TALIESIN: That is true.

1836
01:12:05.089 --> 01:12:07.497
MARISHA: Well, Caduceus, what was your point?

1837
01:12:07.497 --> 01:12:12.497
Like goals, we need goals, was more or less the one liner?

1838
01:12:12.563 --> 01:12:14.458
TALIESIN: Yeah, we need to know, I mean--

1839
01:12:14.458 --> 01:12:16.022
LAURA: We need to know what they want.

1840
01:12:16.022 --> 01:12:17.765
TALIESIN: Know what they actually want, beyond like--

1841
01:12:17.765 --> 01:12:19.716
LAURA: They're not going to tell us that.
TRAVIS: No, they won't.

1842
01:12:19.716 --> 01:12:22.597
TALIESIN: Or at least a general idea, if they even

1843
01:12:22.597 --> 01:12:23.645
know what they want.

1844
01:12:23.645 --> 01:12:25.193
If they don't tell us what they want,

1845
01:12:25.193 --> 01:12:28.107
then we at least need to know that they have some,

1846
01:12:28.107 --> 01:12:30.282
that there is a world, that--

1847
01:12:30.282 --> 01:12:32.990
I've been thinking about

1848
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:35.509
when you're planting vegetables.

1849
01:12:35.509 --> 01:12:37.600
TRAVIS: Oh god.

1850
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.804
TALIESIN: Hear me out.
MARISHA: Okay.

1851
01:12:38.804 --> 01:12:41.606
TALIESIN: And if you have two, you have two plants

1852
01:12:41.606 --> 01:12:43.701
that need different things in the soil,

1853
01:12:43.701 --> 01:12:47.180
and if they're going to not both grow at the same time

1854
01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.174
and how you deal with that.

1855
01:12:48.174 --> 01:12:50.143
And honestly, usually just one dies,

1856
01:12:50.143 --> 01:12:53.880
and I have been trying to figure out

1857
01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.180
what the answer to this is, it's very frustrating.

1858
01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:00.498
ASHLEY: But sometimes they compliment each other,

1859
01:13:00.498 --> 01:13:02.640
if you have two different vegetables together.

1860
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.775
TALIESIN: Sometimes if you plant the right things,

1861
01:13:06.775 --> 01:13:11.573
but if two plants are fighting over a chunk of land, though,

1862
01:13:11.573 --> 01:13:14.995
I've never known it to just stop being a problem.

1863
01:13:14.995 --> 01:13:18.299
LAURA: Sometimes they stop growing, fighting,

1864
01:13:18.299 --> 01:13:20.154
and you can make them intertwine,

1865
01:13:20.154 --> 01:13:23.360
and it turns into a really beautiful tree sculpture.

1866
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.272
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: Well, I'm not--

1867
01:13:24.272 --> 01:13:25.271
LAURA: They do that sometimes

1868
01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:26.213
in Nicodranas.
TALIESIN: At the very least, you could put

1869
01:13:26.213 --> 01:13:27.871
some stones down sometimes

1870
01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:30.342
and keep, you know, make some flower beds or something.

1871
01:13:30.342 --> 01:13:31.366
LAURA: Yeah, sometimes--

1872
01:13:31.366 --> 01:13:33.566
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you all talking about?!

1873
01:13:33.566 --> 01:13:34.736
(laughter)

1874
01:13:34.736 --> 01:13:36.391
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, hang on.

1875
01:13:36.391 --> 01:13:37.740
I see what he's getting at, though.

1876
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:38.573
But--
TALIESIN: You do?

1877
01:13:38.573 --> 01:13:40.171
Wow.
MARISHA: People have been cultivating

1878
01:13:40.171 --> 01:13:44.560
and making plants work for us for thousands of years, man.

1879
01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.073
But to your point--
TRAVIS: Are you stoned right now?

1880
01:13:47.073 --> 01:13:49.632
MARISHA: That dwarven shit is fucking strong.

1881
01:13:49.632 --> 01:13:53.431
So you got to make the ground work for you, right?

1882
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:55.674
Like you said, the stones, the beds,

1883
01:13:55.674 --> 01:13:56.819
sometimes you got to to make barriers.

1884
01:13:56.819 --> 01:13:58.116
TALIESIN: What does the kale need to grow,

1885
01:13:58.116 --> 01:13:59.665
what do the potatoes need to grow?

1886
01:13:59.665 --> 01:14:02.483
They got to each have what they need.

1887
01:14:02.483 --> 01:14:04.602
No, this is good.

1888
01:14:04.602 --> 01:14:07.341
LIAM: I would like, for a moment, to move us away

1889
01:14:07.341 --> 01:14:12.338
from a botany metaphor, and suggest that perhaps

1890
01:14:12.338 --> 01:14:15.292
the one angle we could use is try to convince them

1891
01:14:15.292 --> 01:14:20.292
that there is a greater threat than either of these nations.

1892
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:24.185
That's what we have been dealing with.

1893
01:14:24.185 --> 01:14:25.726
It's the only thing that could pull them

1894
01:14:25.726 --> 01:14:30.067
out of their own asses, perhaps.

1895
01:14:30.067 --> 01:14:32.266
LAURA: I feel like we, did we stop it though,

1896
01:14:32.266 --> 01:14:34.442
for a while, at least, that part?

1897
01:14:34.442 --> 01:14:35.570
TRAVIS: Perhaps.

1898
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:39.062
I agree with Caleb, but only to the ends of

1899
01:14:39.062 --> 01:14:42.099
seeing who might react to that sort of revelation.

1900
01:14:42.099 --> 01:14:45.332
I feel like, I think we're in agreement here.

1901
01:14:45.332 --> 01:14:48.854
These people we're going to meet with are part of this, yes?

1902
01:14:48.854 --> 01:14:52.170
That the war is a distraction that someone in these meetings

1903
01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:55.830
on the Empire side is hoping that no one knows

1904
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:57.587
that this is happening.

1905
01:14:57.587 --> 01:15:01.904
MARISHA: Also, it's incredibly strange that the Empire

1906
01:15:01.904 --> 01:15:06.596
is now 100% in charge of cleaning up the mess

1907
01:15:06.596 --> 01:15:10.379
from where the Chained Oblivion is being held

1908
01:15:10.379 --> 01:15:13.412
under that temple, and

1909
01:15:13.412 --> 01:15:16.740
are we just supposed to trust that?

1910
01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.373
Like, now no--
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

1911
01:15:18.373 --> 01:15:20.015
TALIESIN: No, that's been worrying me.

1912
01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.246
MARISHA: You know.

1913
01:15:22.146 --> 01:15:25.592
LAURA: Number nine, the Empire is not solely in charge

1914
01:15:25.592 --> 01:15:28.300
of cleaning up where the Unchained Oblivion was.

1915
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.664
We also get to be in charge of that.

1916
01:15:30.664 --> 01:15:33.913
TRAVIS: Hmm. No.
LAURA: Number 10: pastries?

1917
01:15:34.932 --> 01:15:36.107
MARISHA: Well, we already have--

1918
01:15:36.107 --> 01:15:37.611
LAURA: All of them at future meetings.

1919
01:15:37.611 --> 01:15:38.860
Just to make sure that the meetings

1920
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.263
that we have with them are, like, catered.

1921
01:15:40.263 --> 01:15:41.230
MARISHA: Right, you want to have, right.

1922
01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:43.231
TALIESIN: We're going to have to find some neutral ground

1923
01:15:43.231 --> 01:15:44.922
for this meeting, too.
LAURA: Maybe some cheese plates.

1924
01:15:44.922 --> 01:15:46.322
MARISHA: I will say, we already have chocolate

1925
01:15:46.322 --> 01:15:49.381
as an incidental, so--
LAURA: Maybe peanut butter and jelly?

1926
01:15:49.381 --> 01:15:50.375
Just surprise me?

1927
01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:51.802
MARISHA: Maybe they put it together?

1928
01:15:51.802 --> 01:15:53.832
Can we have chocolate and pastries--

1929
01:15:53.832 --> 01:15:57.479
SAM: Well, here's a thing that we should strive for, maybe.

1930
01:15:57.479 --> 01:16:01.201
We get to choose the meeting location.

1931
01:16:01.201 --> 01:16:03.453
Maybe that could be a thing that we strive for?

1932
01:16:03.453 --> 01:16:04.331
LAURA: Number 11.

1933
01:16:04.331 --> 01:16:07.336
MARISHA: Wait, is that number, hang on, you skipped 10.

1934
01:16:07.336 --> 01:16:09.374
LAURA: No, I didn't, 10 was pastries.

1935
01:16:09.374 --> 01:16:11.641
ASHLEY: That was chocolate and pastries and cheese.

1936
01:16:11.641 --> 01:16:13.758
LAURA: Well, technically, seven was chocolate.

1937
01:16:13.758 --> 01:16:15.991
ASHLEY: Seven was chocolate, I'm sorry.
MARISHA: So wait, you want,

1938
01:16:15.991 --> 01:16:17.582
we're confirming that chocolate

1939
01:16:17.582 --> 01:16:19.858
and pastries are two different breakout incidentals.

1940
01:16:19.858 --> 01:16:22.399
All right, okay, 10 is pastries.

1941
01:16:22.399 --> 01:16:23.641
SAM: Maybe we should just suss this out

1942
01:16:23.641 --> 01:16:25.300
when we meet them tomorrow.

1943
01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.883
TALIESIN: We're going to hear a lot.

1944
01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:30.225
SAM: I think we've got a good plan here, guys.

1945
01:16:30.225 --> 01:16:32.152
TRAVIS: We've got a core set of deal terms.

1946
01:16:32.152 --> 01:16:34.331
Can we please go to sleep?

1947
01:16:34.331 --> 01:16:37.405
LAURA: 11, we get to choose where we meet.

1948
01:16:37.405 --> 01:16:38.365
Where it happens.

1949
01:16:38.365 --> 01:16:41.013
MARISHA: Okay, well hang on, I was changing nine,

1950
01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.238
because the Empire is

1951
01:16:42.238 --> 01:16:44.849
not in charge of cleaning up--
SAM: Nine was sort of a big ask.

1952
01:16:44.849 --> 01:16:45.720
I don't think we're going to--

1953
01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.359
MARISHA: Okay, so we'll replace nine and do

1954
01:16:48.359 --> 01:16:51.535
we choose meeting location, and then that gives us

1955
01:16:51.535 --> 01:16:53.726
an even 10 incidentals,

1956
01:16:53.726 --> 01:16:55.752
which is good.
TRAVIS: That's a shitload of asks.

1957
01:16:55.752 --> 01:16:57.060
Just saying.
MARISHA: But

1958
01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.451
you know how contract negotiation goes, Fjord.

1959
01:16:59.451 --> 01:17:02.783
You always stack it, that way you can lose some.

1960
01:17:02.783 --> 01:17:04.544
TRAVIS: That's actually a myth.

1961
01:17:04.544 --> 01:17:07.751
Okay.
(laughter)

1962
01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:09.138
SAM: All right.

1963
01:17:09.138 --> 01:17:10.526
Good night, everyone.

1964
01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:11.948
Oh wait, we're still talking?

1965
01:17:11.948 --> 01:17:13.371
LAURA: Are we all sleeping in this room?

1966
01:17:13.371 --> 01:17:15.260
SAM: No, we have our individual rooms.

1967
01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.826
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Are you all right on maybe--

1968
01:17:16.826 --> 01:17:18.542
LAURA: I don't like that we're separated.

1969
01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:20.447
I feel like somebody's going to come while we're sleeping

1970
01:17:20.447 --> 01:17:22.037
and try to steal Caleb away.

1971
01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:24.798
TALIESIN: Actually, it might be a good idea to have

1972
01:17:25.957 --> 01:17:29.547
pairs and in the rooms, and not do the single rooms.

1973
01:17:29.547 --> 01:17:32.797
SAM: I volunteer to sleep next to Caleb.

1974
01:17:34.297 --> 01:17:36.372
MARISHA: I'm going to go to sleep in my own room.

1975
01:17:36.372 --> 01:17:37.573
I'm right next door to those two,

1976
01:17:37.573 --> 01:17:39.678
just, like, pound on the wall if you need me.

1977
01:17:39.678 --> 01:17:40.753
TALIESIN: Fjord?

1978
01:17:40.753 --> 01:17:42.142
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

1979
01:17:42.142 --> 01:17:43.239
I'll room up.

1980
01:17:43.239 --> 01:17:45.072
LAURA: You don't want to...

1981
01:17:47.687 --> 01:17:50.420
Yasha, do you want to be my roommate?

1982
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.273
ASHLEY: Yeah, I will be your roommate.

1983
01:17:52.273 --> 01:17:54.222
LAURA: Okay.

1984
01:17:54.222 --> 01:17:55.055
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1985
01:17:55.055 --> 01:17:59.567
Did you get, you have one of the garden rooms, right?

1986
01:17:59.567 --> 01:18:00.521
LAURA: Sure.

1987
01:18:00.521 --> 01:18:02.077
ASHLEY: I think--
SAM: You did.

1988
01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:03.476
ASHLEY: You did.
LAURA: Sweet.

1989
01:18:03.476 --> 01:18:04.601
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1990
01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:05.681
ASHLEY: Yeah, I will come in there.

1991
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.441
LAURA: Okay.

1992
01:18:07.441 --> 01:18:09.607
MARISHA: Caduceus, you're flying solo?

1993
01:18:09.607 --> 01:18:10.606
TALIESIN: No, we're--
MARISHA: Oh.

1994
01:18:10.606 --> 01:18:12.515
TRAVIS: Just you.
MARISHA: Oh, I'm flying-- okay.

1995
01:18:12.515 --> 01:18:14.939
LAURA: I thought that's what
you said you were doing, Beau!

1996
01:18:14.939 --> 01:18:16.778
MARISHA: Well, I just didn't want to sleep with them.

1997
01:18:16.778 --> 01:18:18.855
LAURA: Well then, sleep with me and Yasha!

1998
01:18:18.855 --> 01:18:19.969
MARISHA: All right, I'll sleep with you and Yasha.

1999
01:18:19.969 --> 01:18:21.099
LAURA: Okay.

2000
01:18:21.099 --> 01:18:22.056
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2001
01:18:22.056 --> 01:18:24.648
(laughter)

2002
01:18:24.648 --> 01:18:28.594
TRAVIS: As we were leaving, can I
lean over to Caleb and say:

2003
01:18:28.594 --> 01:18:33.594
If you want to finish this on a personal level, let me know.

2004
01:18:34.499 --> 01:18:35.662
And I'll leave.

2005
01:18:35.662 --> 01:18:36.495
MATT: Okay.

2006
01:18:37.943 --> 01:18:42.051
You all adjourn to your chosen bunk chambers,

2007
01:18:43.072 --> 01:18:46.396
and bed down for the night, unless there's no other business

2008
01:18:46.396 --> 01:18:47.294
to attend to.

2009
01:18:47.294 --> 01:18:50.180
LIAM: Silver wire around the room, across the window.

2010
01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:51.469
MATT: I assume at this point.

2011
01:18:51.469 --> 01:18:53.594
TALIESIN: ♪ Rest the long rest ♪

2012
01:18:53.594 --> 01:18:55.659
LAURA: I'm just going to take some ribbon

2013
01:18:55.659 --> 01:18:59.224
and tie it across the doorway in case somebody opens it--

2014
01:18:59.224 --> 01:19:01.720
MATT: Good call.
LAURA: They can trip over the bottom.

2015
01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.367
MATT: There you go.
LAURA: Yeah.

2016
01:19:03.367 --> 01:19:06.533
ASHLEY: Should we put-- Do you have like--

2017
01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:08.159
Does Sprinkle have, like, a bell

2018
01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:11.149
or something, or your thing?

2019
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:14.195
Your little animal, does it have to like dink-a-dink-a-dink?

2020
01:19:14.195 --> 01:19:15.107
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) No!

2021
01:19:15.107 --> 01:19:18.414
LAURA: No, but he can have one of my bells.

2022
01:19:18.414 --> 01:19:20.468
I'm going to take a bell off of my--

2023
01:19:20.468 --> 01:19:22.232
SAM: [Inaudible]

2024
01:19:22.232 --> 01:19:25.043
LAURA: Should we connect the bell
to the ribbon, in case you--

2025
01:19:25.043 --> 01:19:27.765
LAURA: Oh, you didn't want Sprinkle
to have it on him, you want--

2026
01:19:27.765 --> 01:19:29.773
MATT: I just envision like--
ASHLEY: Well no, in case someone--

2027
01:19:29.773 --> 01:19:30.973
we would hear it.

2028
01:19:30.973 --> 01:19:34.078
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, I'll tie
the little bell onto the ribbon

2029
01:19:34.078 --> 01:19:36.285
so that if anybody opens the door,

2030
01:19:36.285 --> 01:19:37.197
it makes a jingling noise.

2031
01:19:37.197 --> 01:19:39.400
MATT: There you go.

2032
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.000
TALIESIN: Before we go to sleep, yeah, no, go ahead.

2033
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.626
Oh yeah, before we go to sleep, I just want to,

2034
01:19:45.626 --> 01:19:47.051
as we're setting up, because I'm going to probably

2035
01:19:47.051 --> 01:19:50.838
sleep on the floor, because I like that.

2036
01:19:50.838 --> 01:19:53.263
Did really well today.

2037
01:19:53.263 --> 01:19:54.263
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2038
01:19:56.032 --> 01:19:58.783
TALIESIN: Tomorrow's going to be hard.

2039
01:19:58.783 --> 01:20:00.458
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

2040
01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:02.269
TALIESIN: Well, I feel like you're going to be tempted

2041
01:20:02.269 --> 01:20:03.785
into some old bad habits,

2042
01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:09.501
and you've been doing really, really well,

2043
01:20:09.501 --> 01:20:12.440
and we're going to be--

2044
01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.541
I feel like we're going to be tested,

2045
01:20:14.541 --> 01:20:19.059
with our convictions and our truth.

2046
01:20:19.059 --> 01:20:21.246
And I know we're going to have to lie,

2047
01:20:21.246 --> 01:20:23.984
and I know we're going to have to be

2048
01:20:23.984 --> 01:20:25.863
complicated in what truths we reveal,

2049
01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:28.375
and I know that it's all in the end going to be

2050
01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:32.458
to try and build a peace, but I just want to make sure that

2051
01:20:33.651 --> 01:20:37.922
you remember where you are and how you became

2052
01:20:37.922 --> 01:20:40.672
this person, and what it's worth.

2053
01:20:43.382 --> 01:20:47.713
TRAVIS: Thank you for saying that.

2054
01:20:47.713 --> 01:20:52.713
Is it important to the Wildmother to be honest at all times?

2055
01:20:54.299 --> 01:20:57.728
TALIESIN: (sighs)

2056
01:20:57.728 --> 01:20:59.881
You know, I don't know.

2057
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:01.781
I would say...

2058
01:21:04.208 --> 01:21:08.342
Well, do you feel that nature is honest,

2059
01:21:08.342 --> 01:21:11.509
or do you feel that nature can lie?

2060
01:21:13.032 --> 01:21:15.066
And does nature lie?

2061
01:21:15.066 --> 01:21:18.028
TRAVIS: I think it can certainly be deceiving.

2062
01:21:18.028 --> 01:21:20.945
Natural camouflage and

2063
01:21:22.101 --> 01:21:26.533
colors and poisons and deterrents and all sorts of things.

2064
01:21:26.533 --> 01:21:29.775
But it's also unyielding, it doesn't change for anyone.

2065
01:21:30.983 --> 01:21:34.570
TALIESIN: I never really thought of it that way.

2066
01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:36.307
Well, I've been waiting on this.

2067
01:21:36.307 --> 01:21:37.523
I'm going to reach into my pocket

2068
01:21:37.523 --> 01:21:42.506
and I'm going to pull out this beautiful,

2069
01:21:42.506 --> 01:21:47.048
ornate seal of the Wildmother that's done up in,

2070
01:21:48.364 --> 01:21:50.087
where normally there's the wheat chaff,

2071
01:21:50.087 --> 01:21:53.437
there's this seaweed ring that's been made out of copper

2072
01:21:55.313 --> 01:21:58.511
that's gone blue and green to look like--

2073
01:21:58.511 --> 01:21:59.511
TRAVIS: Ooh! Sorry.
LAURA: (laughs)

2074
01:22:00.357 --> 01:22:02.471
TALIESIN: With with an iron spike through it,

2075
01:22:02.471 --> 01:22:07.471
like an anchored spike, and then a blue in the center

2076
01:22:07.472 --> 01:22:11.720
is like a blue wave crystal that gleams.

2077
01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.137
LAURA: That's really fucking cool.

2078
01:22:15.701 --> 01:22:17.856
TALIESIN: I mean, it's nice of you to ask me
every now and then,

2079
01:22:17.856 --> 01:22:20.381
but I don't really know if you need to that often anymore.

2080
01:22:20.381 --> 01:22:22.901
You seem to have a handle on things.

2081
01:22:22.901 --> 01:22:25.727
TRAVIS: Where did this even come from?

2082
01:22:25.727 --> 01:22:27.180
TALIESIN: It was made at the forge.

2083
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.880
LAURA: (gasps)

2084
01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:32.130
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for the right moment.

2085
01:22:33.408 --> 01:22:35.044
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2086
01:22:35.044 --> 01:22:36.044
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2087
01:22:37.236 --> 01:22:40.461
You're on your way.

2088
01:22:40.461 --> 01:22:44.492
You're already well on the path, and I think that

2089
01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:45.699
the more that you look to yourself

2090
01:22:45.699 --> 01:22:47.007
for some of these answers--

2091
01:22:47.007 --> 01:22:48.532
and I'm always happy to hear them--

2092
01:22:49.999 --> 01:22:53.556
I think you'll be finding that they're in there.

2093
01:22:53.556 --> 01:22:55.806
TRAVIS: Thank you for helping me.

2094
01:22:56.799 --> 01:22:59.690
I'm really, really glad that we--

2095
01:23:00.765 --> 01:23:03.540
that our paths crossed.

2096
01:23:04.507 --> 01:23:06.862
TALIESIN: To divine intervention.

2097
01:23:06.862 --> 01:23:09.445
TRAVIS: To divine intervention.

2098
01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:11.799
TALIESIN: All right.

2099
01:23:11.799 --> 01:23:15.477
TRAVIS: I've got to find a dope-ass place for this thing.

2100
01:23:15.477 --> 01:23:18.087
I weigh it carefully. Sword or chest?

2101
01:23:18.087 --> 01:23:20.418
MATT: (laughs)

2102
01:23:20.418 --> 01:23:21.915
That's awesome.

2103
01:23:21.915 --> 01:23:23.074
All right.

2104
01:23:24.423 --> 01:23:26.100
Yeah, he's been planning that since the forge.

2105
01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:26.933
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2106
01:23:26.933 --> 01:23:30.376
Thank you for letting me do that way back when.
MATT: Of course, man.

2107
01:23:30.376 --> 01:23:34.789
You all bed down for a long night's sleep,

2108
01:23:34.789 --> 01:23:37.836
well earned after a very strenuous,

2109
01:23:37.836 --> 01:23:40.503
emotionally and physically, day.

2110
01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.497
As sleep comes to you, Yasha.

2111
01:23:46.515 --> 01:23:50.208
The gentle sound of the rain fall against the window

2112
01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:54.590
of the chamber lulls you into familiar slumber,

2113
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:59.257
and that place that had been your escape from your

2114
01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:04.370
all-too-familiar imprisonment these past months

2115
01:24:05.572 --> 01:24:08.399
comes to you once more.

2116
01:24:08.399 --> 01:24:13.399
In this dream you're pushing through a dark, tight ravine

2117
01:24:13.519 --> 01:24:17.027
surrounded by craggy rocks that are slick with rainfall.

2118
01:24:17.027 --> 01:24:20.353
Your boots slip and sink into mud and rock,

2119
01:24:20.353 --> 01:24:23.044
and you reach out and grab and pull yourself along,

2120
01:24:23.044 --> 01:24:24.918
your muscles aching.

2121
01:24:24.918 --> 01:24:27.687
You can hear behind you, in the distance,

2122
01:24:27.687 --> 01:24:31.299
the rolling of thunder, flash of light above,

2123
01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:35.437
and echoing through the cavern above you,

2124
01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:38.188
your ears ringing from the impact again.

2125
01:24:38.188 --> 01:24:40.728
Again, (thunder booming), again.

2126
01:24:40.728 --> 01:24:44.482
You push forward up over an edge, breathing heavy,

2127
01:24:44.482 --> 01:24:46.517
looking up, the rain spills against your face,

2128
01:24:46.517 --> 01:24:48.493
causing you to wince over your eyes,

2129
01:24:48.493 --> 01:24:50.679
and still ahead of you, all you see are clouds.

2130
01:24:50.679 --> 01:24:51.832
It's too dark to make out.

2131
01:24:51.832 --> 01:24:54.935
The path, it seems, is blocked by fog and darkness,

2132
01:24:54.935 --> 01:24:57.235
but you push on through the pain.

2133
01:24:57.235 --> 01:24:58.966
You continue to climb in distress,

2134
01:24:58.966 --> 01:25:00.771
not knowing where it leads, but all you know

2135
01:25:00.771 --> 01:25:03.223
is you have to climb, you have to climb,

2136
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.928
and you pull, and you stumble, and you fall back,

2137
01:25:05.928 --> 01:25:08.211
and you hit the rock, and you feel the pain,

2138
01:25:08.211 --> 01:25:13.183
the sharp, jabbing pain of one of the large spiked boulders

2139
01:25:13.183 --> 01:25:15.506
in the side of this ravine stick into you,

2140
01:25:15.506 --> 01:25:17.994
and you pick yourself back up and you keep pushing

2141
01:25:17.994 --> 01:25:21.027
and keep pushing, and eventually,

2142
01:25:22.017 --> 01:25:25.455
the rhythmic steps of your feet

2143
01:25:25.455 --> 01:25:28.230
begin to match the beat of your heart.

2144
01:25:28.230 --> 01:25:32.935
The rain begins to go from an intense typhoon

2145
01:25:32.935 --> 01:25:35.277
to a gentle drizzle.

2146
01:25:35.277 --> 01:25:38.422
The fog begins to pull away.

2147
01:25:38.422 --> 01:25:41.465
The pain begins to subside, and the strength

2148
01:25:41.465 --> 01:25:43.929
begins to return to you.

2149
01:25:43.929 --> 01:25:48.929
As you watch the path begin to recede in its incline,

2150
01:25:50.487 --> 01:25:55.487
you finally see yourself crest the top of this mountain.

2151
01:25:55.728 --> 01:25:59.023
As you step to the edge of this cliff,

2152
01:25:59.023 --> 01:26:02.380
you can see the storm ahead of you.

2153
01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:07.380
Not a terrible torrent, but a welcoming rain.

2154
01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:10.926
And it looks to be the light of a coming a sunrise

2155
01:26:10.926 --> 01:26:13.515
just cresting over the horizon.

2156
01:26:13.515 --> 01:26:15.396
You look down at the sides of your arms,

2157
01:26:15.396 --> 01:26:18.494
your wet hand, and you can see the shackles, the metal,

2158
01:26:18.494 --> 01:26:20.501
and there, dangling from them, are the broken chains

2159
01:26:20.501 --> 01:26:23.797
that you failed to break once before.

2160
01:26:23.797 --> 01:26:26.070
You look back up in the sky, you can see

2161
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:28.821
the roiling clouds themselves,

2162
01:26:28.821 --> 01:26:33.209
the glowing, electric eyes of the entity that found you

2163
01:26:33.209 --> 01:26:36.126
on the ship all those weeks before.

2164
01:26:37.506 --> 01:26:42.464
No words, but a sense of pride and welcoming,

2165
01:26:44.655 --> 01:26:46.228
and you sleep the best sleep you've had

2166
01:26:46.228 --> 01:26:48.395
in a very, very long time.

2167
01:26:52.746 --> 01:26:55.454
You all wake up in the morning.

2168
01:26:55.454 --> 01:26:56.580
SAM: Long rest!

2169
01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.993
MATT: Sore as fuck.

2170
01:26:58.993 --> 01:27:03.993
But comfortably enjoying your morning

2171
01:27:04.205 --> 01:27:06.505
here in this very, very nice establishment.

2172
01:27:06.505 --> 01:27:11.329
LAURA: While Yasha was sleeping, I wrote up

2173
01:27:11.329 --> 01:27:15.096
some sexy pages of writing,

2174
01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.275
and I put them in the back of the book

2175
01:27:17.275 --> 01:27:19.500
that she's learning from, just so she has some good--

2176
01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.494
MATT: There you go.

2177
01:27:20.494 --> 01:27:22.865
(laughter)

2178
01:27:22.865 --> 01:27:23.698
MATT: All righty.

2179
01:27:23.698 --> 01:27:26.033
TRAVIS: We now know what Jester's
career path is going to be.

2180
01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:27.640
SAM: Will you describe them, please?

2181
01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.693
(laughter)

2182
01:27:28.693 --> 01:27:30.252
LAURA: In vivid detail.

2183
01:27:30.252 --> 01:27:31.711
ASHLEY: I'm writing that on the back of this.

2184
01:27:31.711 --> 01:27:35.501
MATT: I do love the idea that there's a very select number

2185
01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:38.418
of these arcane tomes that are all relics

2186
01:27:38.418 --> 01:27:41.520
of the Age of Arcanum, that are one of the few artifacts

2187
01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.958
that can physically alter a person's physiology

2188
01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.991
and mental prowess permanently.

2189
01:27:45.991 --> 01:27:48.519
It is a forgotten art form, and over time,

2190
01:27:48.519 --> 01:27:50.669
there's just going to be many versions of them

2191
01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:53.420
defaced permanently
LAURA: (laughs)

2192
01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:57.962
with perverse sketches and passages, I love it.

2193
01:27:57.962 --> 01:27:59.649
TRAVIS: Kama Sutra positions.

2194
01:27:59.649 --> 01:28:01.031
(laughter)

2195
01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:03.262
MATT: It's like all the old, you know, monk tomes

2196
01:28:03.262 --> 01:28:06.230
with all the perverse shit in the margins.

2197
01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:07.755
just grew bored of copying.

2198
01:28:07.755 --> 01:28:10.794
MARISHA: Trumpets in the asshole.
MATT: Yep.

2199
01:28:10.794 --> 01:28:12.442
MARISHA: They had things with putting
trumpets in their butts.

2200
01:28:12.442 --> 01:28:13.474
MATT: Yeah, farts are funny.

2201
01:28:13.474 --> 01:28:15.528
Even even back in the horrible middle ages.

2202
01:28:15.528 --> 01:28:17.301
Farts were still funny.
LIAM: Butt jokes are eternal.

2203
01:28:17.301 --> 01:28:18.648
MARISHA: Yeah, man.
MATT: It's human nature.

2204
01:28:18.648 --> 01:28:19.481
LAURA: Yeah.

2205
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:24.024
MATT: So you guys gather yourselves, head downstairs

2206
01:28:24.024 --> 01:28:29.024
to be greeted by the smell of morning meal that is prepared.

2207
01:28:29.613 --> 01:28:32.739
As you one by one begin to step down into the main chamber,

2208
01:28:32.739 --> 01:28:36.226
you can see there is a figure sitting in a chair

2209
01:28:36.226 --> 01:28:39.050
facing towards the stairway by the front door.

2210
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:42.248
It looks to be a man, human, in his late twenties,

2211
01:28:42.248 --> 01:28:44.081
long, shoulder length black hair

2212
01:28:44.081 --> 01:28:48.709
that's tucked behind his ears, a mustache that's thin.

2213
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:51.943
As soon as he sees you, he gets up and then leaves.

2214
01:28:51.943 --> 01:28:53.498
SAM: Oh.

2215
01:28:53.498 --> 01:28:56.753
Should we trail him?
LAURA: Did he make eye contact with us at all,

2216
01:28:56.753 --> 01:28:58.090
or he just saw us and left?

2217
01:28:58.090 --> 01:28:59.283
TRAVIS: He saw us.
MATT: He saw you.

2218
01:28:59.283 --> 01:29:01.669
Stood up, not in a rush, but like stood up.

2219
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:05.307
SAM: He's probably just reporting that we're up and about.

2220
01:29:05.307 --> 01:29:07.440
MARISHA: I want to, not <i>follow him</i>-follow him,

2221
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.610
but peek out the door after a moment

2222
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:12.750
and see which direction he went.

2223
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.206
MATT: Okay.

2224
01:29:14.206 --> 01:29:17.907
He went into the northeastern direction.

2225
01:29:17.907 --> 01:29:19.845
You guys are on the southwest area

2226
01:29:19.845 --> 01:29:21.745
of the Shimmer Ward, he's heading to the northeast.

2227
01:29:21.745 --> 01:29:22.895
TRAVIS: The Mud Top Ward?

2228
01:29:22.895 --> 01:29:24.672
LIAM: That's towards the center.
MATT: This is the Shimmer Ward.

2229
01:29:24.672 --> 01:29:26.408
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know.
MARISHA: Towards the center of the city.

2230
01:29:26.408 --> 01:29:29.027
MATT: And in the direction of where the castle terrace is.

2231
01:29:29.027 --> 01:29:31.133
LIAM: I think he said we were here, and that's north.

2232
01:29:31.133 --> 01:29:33.836
TRAVIS: Oh, there's a fucking map? Awesome, man.

2233
01:29:33.836 --> 01:29:35.462
LAURA: Who the fuck are you? Where you going?

2234
01:29:35.462 --> 01:29:37.214
That's a Sending message.

2235
01:29:37.214 --> 01:29:39.305
MATT: Okay. To who?

2236
01:29:40.532 --> 01:29:42.001
MARISHA: Hey dick!
TRAVIS: I see you!

2237
01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:44.062
LAURA: Hey dick, come back here!
MARISHA: Piece of shit!

2238
01:29:44.062 --> 01:29:45.797
LIAM: Get your mullet back here, you asshole.

2239
01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:48.149
SAM: Were we supposed to go to a specific place

2240
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:50.046
to meet this gentleman?

2241
01:29:50.046 --> 01:29:51.260
Or--?

2242
01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.197
MATT: You don't know.

2243
01:29:52.197 --> 01:29:54.149
SAM: They're coming to us. probably.

2244
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:55.076
Well.

2245
01:29:55.076 --> 01:29:56.974
MATT: You have breakfast.

2246
01:29:56.974 --> 01:30:00.082
The meals are not included.

2247
01:30:00.082 --> 01:30:02.055
LAURA: (grumbling)

2248
01:30:02.055 --> 01:30:05.234
MATT: But in a similar route, it is five silver pieces

2249
01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:07.496
per person for the breakfast, which is expensive,

2250
01:30:07.496 --> 01:30:09.120
but not unheard of.

2251
01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.753
LAURA: This is going to add up.
TRAVIS: Five silver for breakfast?

2252
01:30:10.753 --> 01:30:11.586
MATT: Yeah.

2253
01:30:11.586 --> 01:30:13.764
So all of you guys, it's about three and a half gold.

2254
01:30:14.697 --> 01:30:16.969
TRAVIS: Three gold and five silver.

2255
01:30:16.969 --> 01:30:18.002
MATT: Go for it.

2256
01:30:18.002 --> 01:30:19.925
SAM: We're going to go halfsies? No one's going to--

2257
01:30:19.925 --> 01:30:23.465
LAURA: No one's going to step up.
SAM: No one's going to take care of good old Nott over here?

2258
01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:25.151
ASHLEY: I'll get breakfast.

2259
01:30:25.151 --> 01:30:26.195
SAM: Thank you.

2260
01:30:26.195 --> 01:30:27.493
(laughter)

2261
01:30:27.493 --> 01:30:28.796
ASHLEY: You got it.

2262
01:30:29.746 --> 01:30:34.254
MATT: As you guys finish your meal, and probably Beauregard,

2263
01:30:34.254 --> 01:30:39.110
anybody else who's keeping an eye on the vicinity,

2264
01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:43.225
you can hear the heavy footfalls of a figure

2265
01:30:43.225 --> 01:30:47.006
enter the central chamber of the cottage,

2266
01:30:47.006 --> 01:30:49.060
which is on the other room, the entrance room,

2267
01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.894
you guys are currently in the tavern chamber,

2268
01:30:50.894 --> 01:30:52.027
which is separated by a wall,

2269
01:30:52.027 --> 01:30:54.602
other than an open archway door.

2270
01:30:54.602 --> 01:30:59.588
You see the shadow come in from the entryway,

2271
01:30:59.588 --> 01:31:01.997
and a voice go, "Ahem."

2272
01:31:03.697 --> 01:31:05.165
MARISHA: Carry on.

2273
01:31:05.165 --> 01:31:07.143
MATT: You have to get up and go over to look through,

2274
01:31:07.143 --> 01:31:10.954
but as you step and peek around the open archway,

2275
01:31:10.954 --> 01:31:14.798
you can see there standing Martinet Ludinus Da'leth.

2276
01:31:14.798 --> 01:31:15.915
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2277
01:31:17.921 --> 01:31:21.490
MATT: He's wearing his walking cloak over the rest

2278
01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:25.367
of his clothes, this sleek, dark black,

2279
01:31:25.367 --> 01:31:27.734
capelet with a long cloak behind it,

2280
01:31:27.734 --> 01:31:30.740
and he has a cane, and is just there.

2281
01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:33.006
Looks over and you hide, and his eyes

2282
01:31:33.006 --> 01:31:35.506
immediately look over and find you.

2283
01:31:35.506 --> 01:31:36.686
"Whenever you're ready."

2284
01:31:36.686 --> 01:31:38.507
MARISHA: Oh, hey man, what's up?

2285
01:31:38.507 --> 01:31:39.585
We're just finishing breakfast.

2286
01:31:39.585 --> 01:31:43.129
You want any coffee?
MATT: "I've already eaten, I appreciate it.

2287
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:46.233
"But whenever you're ready, follow me,

2288
01:31:46.233 --> 01:31:48.985
"and we will begin our discussion."

2289
01:31:48.985 --> 01:31:51.134
MARISHA: All right, we're paying our bill,

2290
01:31:51.134 --> 01:31:53.474
give us like five minutes.

2291
01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:55.024
MATT: He goes and sits down in the chair

2292
01:31:55.024 --> 01:31:58.524
where the previous individual was sitting and waiting.

2293
01:32:00.215 --> 01:32:02.086
(chuckles)

2294
01:32:02.086 --> 01:32:03.536
All right.

2295
01:32:03.536 --> 01:32:05.329
You guys finish your meal?
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

2296
01:32:05.329 --> 01:32:09.737
LAURA: Did you want to come sit at a table with us?
SAM: He said he already ate.

2297
01:32:09.737 --> 01:32:13.347
MATT: He's actually sitting in the main
entryway of the cottage.

2298
01:32:13.347 --> 01:32:14.498
LAURA: Oh.

2299
01:32:14.498 --> 01:32:16.695
(louder) Did you want to come sit over--?

2300
01:32:16.695 --> 01:32:17.528
MATT: "I'm all right."

2301
01:32:17.528 --> 01:32:18.930
TALIESIN: Herbal tea to go or anything?

2302
01:32:18.930 --> 01:32:20.972
MATT: "I'm fine, thank you."

2303
01:32:20.972 --> 01:32:23.281
MARISHA: I tried.
TALIESIN: Did you set your spells, by the way?

2304
01:32:24.203 --> 01:32:25.957
SAM: Take some bacon for the road.

2305
01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:27.982
MATT: All right, pocket bacon, good man.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

2306
01:32:27.982 --> 01:32:30.850
MATT: All righty. As you guys enter the next chamber,

2307
01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:35.016
he stands. "Very well. Now, please follow.

2308
01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:37.569
"We will go to a place where we can have a conversation

2309
01:32:37.569 --> 01:32:41.488
"without prying ears or eyes."

2310
01:32:41.488 --> 01:32:44.860
He turns and walks out into the fine cobblestone

2311
01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.176
of the Shimmer Ward.
SAM: Is he alone? No guards?

2312
01:32:46.176 --> 01:32:47.018
MATT: No guards.

2313
01:32:47.018 --> 01:32:48.113
SAM: Wow.

2314
01:32:48.113 --> 01:32:49.459
Bold.

2315
01:32:49.459 --> 01:32:51.198
LIAM: He's not sweating it.

2316
01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:55.265
MATT: You guys follow, and carry through the Shimmer Ward

2317
01:32:55.265 --> 01:32:57.279
towards the castle, and you're like, oh,

2318
01:32:57.279 --> 01:32:58.332
we're going to meet at the castle.

2319
01:32:58.332 --> 01:33:00.582
You begin to hear the town criers have now begun

2320
01:33:00.582 --> 01:33:04.473
to come to their daily travel

2321
01:33:04.473 --> 01:33:07.561
and expression of the news

2322
01:33:07.561 --> 01:33:10.467
as it is meant to be disseminated amongst the populace.

2323
01:33:10.467 --> 01:33:15.428
You hear a female voice, young and very loud,

2324
01:33:15.428 --> 01:33:20.428
crying out, "Dynasty incursion repelled by Imperial forces!

2325
01:33:21.003 --> 01:33:22.895
"King Dwendal claims his victory

2326
01:33:22.895 --> 01:33:25.895
"over failed attack on the capital!"

2327
01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.296
You guys continue walking a bit further,

2328
01:33:29.296 --> 01:33:31.692
and another bit of information creeps out, saying,

2329
01:33:31.692 --> 01:33:33.921
"Freak lightning storm accident

2330
01:33:33.921 --> 01:33:37.858
"damages the Chantry Cathedral, repairs are underway!"

2331
01:33:37.858 --> 01:33:41.428
LAURA: (laughs)
SAM: Starting to think the news is not accurate.

2332
01:33:41.428 --> 01:33:44.495
(laughter)

2333
01:33:44.495 --> 01:33:48.005
MATT: You pass the castle terrace entrance.

2334
01:33:48.005 --> 01:33:50.377
You bypass the gates on the southern side of it

2335
01:33:50.377 --> 01:33:55.377
and head along the eastern side of the terrace outer wall,

2336
01:33:55.653 --> 01:33:59.207
until eventually, you are northeast of the castle terrace,

2337
01:33:59.207 --> 01:34:03.159
and you approach the dizzying sight of the Candles:

2338
01:34:03.159 --> 01:34:06.358
eight scattered, un-uniform, and in some cases

2339
01:34:06.358 --> 01:34:10.075
almost gravity-defying towers that dominate the sky above

2340
01:34:10.075 --> 01:34:12.261
within this proximity.

2341
01:34:12.261 --> 01:34:15.169
Some are crooked and holding at impossible angles

2342
01:34:15.169 --> 01:34:17.540
while others seem to focus on sleek design

2343
01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.732
and imposing height.

2344
01:34:19.732 --> 01:34:22.709
You are led by Ludinus to a silver spire

2345
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:24.745
that sits taller than the rest.

2346
01:34:24.745 --> 01:34:27.273
A monolith of shimmering stone with numerous balconies

2347
01:34:27.273 --> 01:34:30.011
and external staircases that emerge and climb,

2348
01:34:30.011 --> 01:34:32.061
then vanish into closed doors.

2349
01:34:33.336 --> 01:34:34.872
The peak itself holds no roof.

2350
01:34:34.872 --> 01:34:38.599
From what you can tell, however, it ends in a platform

2351
01:34:38.599 --> 01:34:40.850
that is framed by four angled obelisks

2352
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:43.951
that almost meet in the center.

2353
01:34:43.951 --> 01:34:46.842
You see no main door on the bottom floor,

2354
01:34:46.842 --> 01:34:48.656
but as you approach the basin,

2355
01:34:48.656 --> 01:34:51.389
Ludinus walks towards the front.

2356
01:34:51.389 --> 01:34:54.949
A light that emits off of him seems to reflect

2357
01:34:54.949 --> 01:34:57.393
off of the stone itself, and it gets extremely bright

2358
01:34:57.393 --> 01:35:00.351
for a second, where you wince and squint your eyes,

2359
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:01.817
and you instinctually blink,

2360
01:35:01.817 --> 01:35:04.486
and as soon as your eyes close and reopen,

2361
01:35:04.486 --> 01:35:08.095
there's a door where previously there wasn't one.

2362
01:35:08.095 --> 01:35:10.239
As Ludinus approaches, he puts his hand up,

2363
01:35:10.239 --> 01:35:11.749
and it just (creaking)

2364
01:35:11.749 --> 01:35:13.769
opens the inside of a dark interior.

2365
01:35:13.769 --> 01:35:15.453
LAURA: That was so cool!

2366
01:35:15.453 --> 01:35:16.644
TALIESIN: It was all right.

2367
01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:18.368
SAM: Don't be too forward.

2368
01:35:18.368 --> 01:35:21.459
We're supposed to be, you know, negotiating position. Hard.

2369
01:35:21.459 --> 01:35:23.501
LAURA: Yeah, but I mean, that was a really cool spell.

2370
01:35:23.501 --> 01:35:25.814
SAM: Okay, but don't tell him that.

2371
01:35:25.814 --> 01:35:27.679
MATT: You guys follow suit?

2372
01:35:27.679 --> 01:35:28.512
LIAM: Yeah, I lead the way.

2373
01:35:28.512 --> 01:35:29.450
MATT: Okay.

2374
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:31.127
You step into the dark interior, where you see

2375
01:35:31.127 --> 01:35:32.643
a number of leather chairs.
MARISHA: As we walk in,

2376
01:35:32.643 --> 01:35:35.343
anybody, like, prying? Any neighbors?

2377
01:35:35.343 --> 01:35:36.919
Any neighbors watching this happen?

2378
01:35:36.919 --> 01:35:38.510
MATT: Make a perception check.

2379
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:40.820
MARISHA: Sorry, not to interrupt.

2380
01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.856
(bitter laugh)

2381
01:35:41.856 --> 01:35:43.924
TRAVIS: That fucking dice.
MARISHA: Every fucking time.

2382
01:35:43.924 --> 01:35:45.065
Just straight perception?

2383
01:35:45.065 --> 01:35:46.340
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: Seven.

2384
01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.596
Eight, eight, eight.

2385
01:35:47.596 --> 01:35:48.433
MATT: It's early enough where there are

2386
01:35:48.433 --> 01:35:50.034
a handful of people walking in the streets

2387
01:35:50.034 --> 01:35:52.075
going about their own business in the Shimmer Ward.

2388
01:35:52.075 --> 01:35:56.029
There isn't a lot of, you know, it's too early

2389
01:35:56.029 --> 01:35:57.763
for folks to be just out on a stroll necessarily,

2390
01:35:57.763 --> 01:35:59.125
but you do see people that are like, you know,

2391
01:35:59.125 --> 01:36:01.667
carrying small carts or satchels, probably just doing

2392
01:36:01.667 --> 01:36:03.993
small deliveries of goods throughout the ward itself.

2393
01:36:03.993 --> 01:36:05.085
No one seems to be paying much attention,

2394
01:36:05.085 --> 01:36:06.502
from what you can tell.

2395
01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:10.190
So you enter the inside, and you can see,

2396
01:36:10.190 --> 01:36:12.220
there is a set of leather chairs that are arranged

2397
01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:16.007
in a circle within a spacious den of some kind.

2398
01:36:16.007 --> 01:36:18.081
The air immediately catches you as the smell of

2399
01:36:18.081 --> 01:36:19.925
a combination of incense and vanilla.

2400
01:36:19.925 --> 01:36:21.761
It's very pleasant.

2401
01:36:21.761 --> 01:36:24.005
You look behind you from where you entered,

2402
01:36:24.005 --> 01:36:27.984
and you see, beyond the door, not the rest

2403
01:36:27.984 --> 01:36:30.510
of the cobblestone in the street where you have stepped in,

2404
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:33.129
but instead of balcony nearly 100 feet off the ground--

2405
01:36:33.129 --> 01:36:34.558
(gasping)

2406
01:36:34.558 --> 01:36:36.663
overlooking the entirety of the ward,

2407
01:36:36.663 --> 01:36:38.753
and much of the city of Rexxentrum.

2408
01:36:38.753 --> 01:36:42.682
It is a gorgeous view of this little portal that you have,

2409
01:36:42.682 --> 01:36:45.052
that you can only imagine, few have been able

2410
01:36:45.052 --> 01:36:47.759
to really enjoy, or maybe will ever see

2411
01:36:47.759 --> 01:36:50.104
from within this tower.

2412
01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:51.586
Ludinus turns around as you all enter.

2413
01:36:51.586 --> 01:36:53.082
"Please, have a seat."

2414
01:36:53.082 --> 01:36:55.535
SAM: I'm going to try to not look impressed.

2415
01:36:55.535 --> 01:36:57.530
LAURA: I'm looking so impressed.

2416
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:58.449
MATT: Make a deception check.

2417
01:36:58.449 --> 01:37:00.386
SAM: Deception check.

2418
01:37:00.386 --> 01:37:04.452
Yes, minus two,

2419
01:37:04.452 --> 01:37:05.297
nine.

2420
01:37:05.297 --> 01:37:06.464
MATT: Nine.
LAURA: Nein!

2421
01:37:07.681 --> 01:37:08.876
MATT: All right.

2422
01:37:08.876 --> 01:37:10.046
(laughter)

2423
01:37:10.046 --> 01:37:12.532
LIAM: Can we see the school from this viewpoint?

2424
01:37:12.532 --> 01:37:14.782
MATT: From this viewpoint?

2425
01:37:14.782 --> 01:37:16.738
Not unless you stand out on the balcony.

2426
01:37:16.738 --> 01:37:19.613
This entryway is actually facing more of the terrace

2427
01:37:19.613 --> 01:37:22.813
and the western side--

2428
01:37:22.813 --> 01:37:24.496
I'm sorry, the eastern side of the terrace,

2429
01:37:24.496 --> 01:37:27.071
so you would not be able to see the school from here.

2430
01:37:28.367 --> 01:37:30.419
You all take your seats?

2431
01:37:30.419 --> 01:37:33.935
SAM: As we do, I just quickly just give Caleb

2432
01:37:33.935 --> 01:37:37.587
a little squeeze on his hand, just and a nod.

2433
01:37:37.587 --> 01:37:38.843
MATT: Okay.

2434
01:37:38.843 --> 01:37:41.830
You see he casts a Mage Hand.

2435
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:44.345
You're familiar with this, this quick maneuver,

2436
01:37:44.345 --> 01:37:48.884
and a small end table (creaking)

2437
01:37:48.884 --> 01:37:51.751
scoots in the middle of the chairs, and--

2438
01:37:51.751 --> 01:37:55.950
LAURA: Eh, that one wasn't as impressive.

2439
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:57.774
MATT: As you're all sitting down, a small tea set

2440
01:37:57.774 --> 01:38:00.129
lifts over and sets onto it.

2441
01:38:00.129 --> 01:38:02.848
It begins to heat up before you, and then begins

2442
01:38:02.848 --> 01:38:06.152
to pour each of you a really nice tea.

2443
01:38:06.152 --> 01:38:08.372
It's like a sweet citrus taste to it.

2444
01:38:08.372 --> 01:38:10.595
TALIESIN: This is pretty good, got to admit.

2445
01:38:10.595 --> 01:38:15.009
MATT: "All right, so, welcome, Mighty Nein."

2446
01:38:15.009 --> 01:38:18.584
LAURA: (laughs) Accidentally fell forward.

2447
01:38:18.584 --> 01:38:19.951
SAM: This is not--

2448
01:38:19.951 --> 01:38:20.784
LAURA: Shut up.

2449
01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:26.526
MATT: "So to get you up to speed with the information

2450
01:38:26.526 --> 01:38:28.821
"as I currently have it.

2451
01:38:28.821 --> 01:38:33.329
"Vence, my previous assistant,

2452
01:38:33.329 --> 01:38:35.229
"has not yet been recovered,

2453
01:38:35.229 --> 01:38:39.086
"but leads are promising, and our operatives

2454
01:38:39.086 --> 01:38:42.583
"expect to close on him within the day."

2455
01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.344
LAURA: He's naked?

2456
01:38:44.344 --> 01:38:45.427
TRAVIS: What?

2457
01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.122
LAURA: I thought you said, your operatives plan

2458
01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:49.743
to find clothes on him by the--

2459
01:38:49.743 --> 01:38:51.738
SAM: To close in on him, close in on him.

2460
01:38:51.738 --> 01:38:52.587
LAURA: Oh.

2461
01:38:52.587 --> 01:38:54.761
TRAVIS and SAM: (chuckling)

2462
01:38:54.761 --> 01:38:59.636
MATT: "He is intended to be
part of this negotiation offering.

2463
01:39:01.595 --> 01:39:04.622
"If he is indeed, as it seems to be,

2464
01:39:04.622 --> 01:39:07.604
"the individual responsible for this,

2465
01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:12.705
"at least partially responsible for this cult, as you say,

2466
01:39:12.705 --> 01:39:16.156
"then I think the Dynasty may be of interest

2467
01:39:16.156 --> 01:39:18.073
"as to his fate as well.

2468
01:39:19.471 --> 01:39:22.312
"Also, the relic of the Kryn

2469
01:39:22.312 --> 01:39:25.103
"has been confirmed recovered,

2470
01:39:25.103 --> 01:39:27.970
"and is being readied for transport under heavy guard

2471
01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:30.878
"whenever, if, that is arranged.

2472
01:39:33.205 --> 01:39:36.456
"Now, I'm sure you have many questions,

2473
01:39:36.456 --> 01:39:38.747
"and we can continue a discussion as we go from here,

2474
01:39:38.747 --> 01:39:41.330
"but I'm curious to hear your--"

2475
01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:47.648
TRAVIS: Could you tell us where your man has been tracked to

2476
01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:49.908
or where they think he's gone?

2477
01:39:49.908 --> 01:39:52.409
What area of the world?

2478
01:39:52.409 --> 01:39:57.401
MATT: "Well, he was not so ill-informed

2479
01:39:58.334 --> 01:40:02.143
"as to attempt any sort of teleportation.

2480
01:40:03.167 --> 01:40:06.515
"We think he's traveling on foot, which is

2481
01:40:06.515 --> 01:40:08.204
"in some ways more challenging to find,

2482
01:40:08.204 --> 01:40:12.917
"based on some of the wards we have placed on our members."

2483
01:40:12.917 --> 01:40:13.750
MARISHA: Hmm.

2484
01:40:15.539 --> 01:40:17.405
MATT: "Individuals of such import are generally

2485
01:40:17.405 --> 01:40:19.515
"marked in a way where we can keep tabs.

2486
01:40:19.515 --> 01:40:20.948
TRAVIS: Hmm.

2487
01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:24.700
LIAM: It sounds like you are prepared to hand him over.

2488
01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:26.517
Do you not have questions of your own?

2489
01:40:26.517 --> 01:40:30.258
MATT: "Oh, we will definitely make our

2490
01:40:30.258 --> 01:40:32.675
"interrogation practices before we hand anyone over,

2491
01:40:32.675 --> 01:40:36.661
"but we are prepared, should it be requested,

01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:39.269
"as part of this negotiation,

2493
01:40:39.269 --> 01:40:42.471
"to perhaps use him as part of the bargaining."

2494
01:40:42.471 --> 01:40:44.554
TALIESIN: Are you prepared for the notion that he might

2495
01:40:44.554 --> 01:40:48.295
just be a small part of a larger corruption?

2496
01:40:48.295 --> 01:40:52.208
MATT: "Oh, we're not stopping with just him.

2497
01:40:52.208 --> 01:40:54.341
"I mean, we understand this cult itself exists

2498
01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:57.731
"far beyond just him, this individual with which

2499
01:40:57.731 --> 01:41:00.602
"you had done battle with beneath the Chantry.

2500
01:41:00.602 --> 01:41:04.232
"These investigations have been now opened quite heavily,

2501
01:41:04.232 --> 01:41:07.252
"and are being handled by both the Augen Trust

2502
01:41:07.252 --> 01:41:09.944
"and members of our Assembly."

2503
01:41:09.944 --> 01:41:12.352
TALIESIN: Would you be

2504
01:41:12.352 --> 01:41:17.135
interested in a possible

2505
01:41:18.268 --> 01:41:20.240
collaboration

2506
01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.794
with the other side of this war, if it meant rooting out

2507
01:41:24.794 --> 01:41:27.400
those people within their society as well,

2508
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.770
since they seem to be communicating?

2509
01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:32.389
MATT: "If you think you can find common ground there

2510
01:41:32.389 --> 01:41:35.208
"that they would agree to, I'm not against it.

2511
01:41:35.208 --> 01:41:37.883
"It would have to be a very

2512
01:41:37.883 --> 01:41:42.129
"carefully outlined alliance,

2513
01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:46.765
"and I am uncertain they would be willing, but."

2514
01:41:46.765 --> 01:41:50.461
LIAM: What is the Empire and the Assembly's current position

2515
01:41:51.561 --> 01:41:54.617
on the Dynasty and the war?

2516
01:41:54.617 --> 01:41:57.225
MATT: "Well, we have little interest in winning

2517
01:41:57.225 --> 01:41:58.942
"a war with them.

2518
01:41:58.942 --> 01:42:03.075
"The spoils of such a conflict are a wasteland

2519
01:42:03.075 --> 01:42:07.250
"of Calamity-scarred marshes and

2520
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:10.217
"deadly beasts, primarily.

2521
01:42:10.217 --> 01:42:12.313
"If anything, the people of the Dynasty themselves

2522
01:42:12.313 --> 01:42:16.367
"existing is a delightful buffer to the Empire

2523
01:42:16.367 --> 01:42:21.367
"from such terrible things and useless landscapes."

2524
01:42:22.027 --> 01:42:24.371
LIAM: And you personally, would you like to see

2525
01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:26.830
this conflict come to a close?

2526
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:28.890
MATT: "Aye, it is very messy.

2527
01:42:28.890 --> 01:42:30.172
"Many lives are lost.

2528
01:42:30.172 --> 01:42:33.766
"It is a distraction from much more important matters,

2529
01:42:33.766 --> 01:42:37.214
"and being able to maintain the peace and prosperity

2530
01:42:37.214 --> 01:42:39.022
"of our own people.

2531
01:42:39.022 --> 01:42:42.467
"It is very challenging to do good

2532
01:42:42.467 --> 01:42:46.124
"and to rightfully guide a society

2533
01:42:46.124 --> 01:42:48.632
"when it's constantly living in fear

2534
01:42:48.632 --> 01:42:51.528
"or driven towards anger."

2535
01:42:51.528 --> 01:42:55.528
TRAVIS: May I ask, have you seen this beacon yourself?

2536
01:42:57.513 --> 01:43:01.983
MATT: "I have been given confirmation of its a retrieval,

2537
01:43:01.983 --> 01:43:04.197
"and was planning to see it myself."

2538
01:43:04.197 --> 01:43:06.614
MARISHA: And who give you confirmation of its retrieval?

2539
01:43:06.614 --> 01:43:09.768
MATT: "Master Ikithon."

2540
01:43:09.768 --> 01:43:10.885
MARISHA: Hmm.

2541
01:43:10.885 --> 01:43:13.541
SAM: Would the idea be that we bring it with us

2542
01:43:13.541 --> 01:43:15.715
to forge a peace?

2543
01:43:15.715 --> 01:43:18.809
Or this is something that's delivered after?

2544
01:43:18.809 --> 01:43:20.612
MATT: "This would be something discussed

2545
01:43:20.612 --> 01:43:23.252
"as part of the negotiation.

2546
01:43:23.252 --> 01:43:27.787
"We could have it at the ready, should its procurement

01:43:27.787 --> 01:43:30.168
"be required as part of this, as I assume

01:43:30.168 --> 01:43:33.154
"it would need to be, but for the first stage

2552
01:43:39.627 --> 01:43:41.494
TRAVIS: Martinet, I'm sure you can appreciate the

2553
01:43:41.494 --> 01:43:46.154
convenience of the offer of giving up the one thing

2554
01:43:46.154 --> 01:43:50.873
that the Dynasty has been so anxious to get their hands on.

2555
01:43:50.873 --> 01:43:54.918
It would aid this negotiation if we were able to confirm

2556
01:43:54.918 --> 01:43:57.946
that the beacon, in fact, exists,

2557
01:43:57.946 --> 01:44:00.001
and that the Empire has it.

2558
01:44:00.001 --> 01:44:01.882
I'm sure you can appreciate the questions

2559
01:44:01.882 --> 01:44:03.833
that we would receive as to the validity

2560
01:44:03.833 --> 01:44:05.777
of its actual ownership.

2561
01:44:05.777 --> 01:44:09.746
MATT: "Would you wish to accompany me in confirming it?"

2562
01:44:09.746 --> 01:44:12.555
TRAVIS: I think it would benefit us greatly if we could say

2563
01:44:12.555 --> 01:44:15.222
that we had seen it with our own eyes.

2564
01:44:15.222 --> 01:44:16.213
MATT: "Done."

2565
01:44:17.238 --> 01:44:19.632
LAURA: All of us get to go see it?

2566
01:44:19.632 --> 01:44:22.660
MATT: "As many of you as could be present."

2567
01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.092
LAURA: Okay, good, good, good, good.

2568
01:44:24.092 --> 01:44:26.553
MARISHA: Where is it being held currently?

2569
01:44:26.553 --> 01:44:29.270
MATT: "I have not confirmed that yet with Master Ikithon,

2570
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:31.049
"but that'll be the next order of business."

2571
01:44:31.049 --> 01:44:33.863
LIAM: Has Master Ikithon told you where it was found?

2572
01:44:33.863 --> 01:44:35.087
MATT: "No.

2573
01:44:35.087 --> 01:44:39.318
"I've not pried too much,
it has only been of recent import."

2574
01:44:39.318 --> 01:44:40.242
MARISHA: Hmm.

2575
01:44:40.242 --> 01:44:41.075
TALIESIN: Hmm.

2576
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:44.703
SAM: Giving that up seems very generous

2577
01:44:44.703 --> 01:44:46.734
on the part of the Empire.

2578
01:44:46.734 --> 01:44:50.041
What in exchange exactly would you be hoping to get back,

2579
01:44:50.041 --> 01:44:52.724
besides assurances?

2580
01:44:52.724 --> 01:44:56.453
MATT: "This is a part of the continued conversation

2581
01:44:56.453 --> 01:44:58.573
"to have with you.

2582
01:44:58.573 --> 01:45:02.072
"This war is not because of this relic.

2583
01:45:02.072 --> 01:45:05.699
"There are many things that led to this conflict.

2584
01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:10.199
"There are many reasons why we have a hard time

2585
01:45:11.483 --> 01:45:15.526
"striking any sort of peace with the Dynasty

2586
01:45:15.526 --> 01:45:19.709
"as long as we've been beside each other.

2587
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:22.215
"I mean, open political unity is challenging

2588
01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:24.207
"because of their religion.

2589
01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:28.556
"The Empire does not recognize this Luxon entity,

2590
01:45:28.556 --> 01:45:31.354
"and the fervor in which they practice

2591
01:45:31.354 --> 01:45:33.990
"this promised escape from the cycle of death

2592
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:36.263
"through a dubious, silent entity.

2593
01:45:36.263 --> 01:45:39.585
"It is both a cause for alarm and cautiousness.

2594
01:45:39.585 --> 01:45:41.349
"The King, along with the Assembly,

2595
01:45:41.349 --> 01:45:42.656
"believe that they are welcome to practice

2596
01:45:42.656 --> 01:45:44.496
"whatever faith they wish, so long as it remains

2597
01:45:44.496 --> 01:45:46.569
"beyond our borders and does not affect

01:45:46.569 --> 01:45:48.962
"the lives of our people.

2599
01:45:48.962 --> 01:45:51.297
"But there has been a history of skirmishes with the Dynasty

01:45:51.297 --> 01:45:55.130
"the stretches over 30 years at this point,

2601
01:45:56.203 --> 01:45:59.490
"which has been escalating in that time period.

2602
01:45:59.490 --> 01:46:03.183
"There have been misrepresented information gathering troops

2603
01:46:03.183 --> 01:46:05.151
"that were captured and tortured by the Kryn

2604
01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:07.700
"that was merely gathering intel to help maintain

2605
01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:10.216
"the security and safety of our people.

2606
01:46:10.216 --> 01:46:12.185
"There have been small encounters between soldiers

2607
01:46:12.185 --> 01:46:15.113
"on both sides growing into
conflict and localized incidents.

2608
01:46:16.005 --> 01:46:19.786
"There was a discovered sect of Kryn missionaries

2609
01:46:19.786 --> 01:46:22.902
"found hiding within Nogvurot over a decade ago

2610
01:46:22.902 --> 01:46:25.638
"that led to a skirmish where many lives were lost

2611
01:46:25.638 --> 01:46:27.579
"on both sides.

2612
01:46:27.579 --> 01:46:31.014
"And this drastically began to raise tensions

2613
01:46:31.014 --> 01:46:35.768
"between both the Empire and the Dynasty.

2614
01:46:35.768 --> 01:46:38.449
"And there had been a high rate of Xhorhasian creatures

2615
01:46:38.449 --> 01:46:42.142
"wandering into our land, which gives reason to believe

2616
01:46:42.142 --> 01:46:47.142
"that there may be intent in pushing them in our direction.

2617
01:46:47.263 --> 01:46:48.913
"There are growing suspicions that the Dynasty

01:46:48.913 --> 01:46:51.888
"covets our comparably

"resource-plentiful lands

2620
01:46:55.446 --> 01:46:59.504
"over their rather desolate landscapes,

2621
01:46:59.504 --> 01:47:02.011
"let alone a general mistrust here within the Empire

2622
01:47:02.011 --> 01:47:06.252
"of goblin kin, my apologies--"
SAM: Hmm.

2623
01:47:06.252 --> 01:47:08.502
MATT: "-- due to the smattering

2624
01:47:08.502 --> 01:47:12.498
"of violent clans, that still claim areas

2625
01:47:12.498 --> 01:47:15.098
"of the Marrow Valley and the surrounding mountain ranges.

2626
01:47:15.098 --> 01:47:18.171
"The history of such strife is hard to erase,

2627
01:47:18.171 --> 01:47:19.936
"regardless of how disciplined and benevolent

2628
01:47:19.936 --> 01:47:23.618
"the waste folk of Xhorhas can sometimes appear to be.

2629
01:47:23.618 --> 01:47:26.099
"So this culmination of the tension

2630
01:47:26.099 --> 01:47:30.182
"only merely erupted when this relic went missing."

2631
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:34.500
MARISHA: What do you think led to this relic

2632
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.225
going missing in the first place?

2633
01:47:39.205 --> 01:47:42.151
MATT: "Honestly, I'm thinking it might have

2634
01:47:42.151 --> 01:47:44.093
"a very direct correlation as to these individuals

2635
01:47:44.093 --> 01:47:48.615
"that you've been recently touting your aggressions against,

2636
01:47:48.615 --> 01:47:53.615
"this Angel of Irons or Tharizdun followers, if you will."

2637
01:47:54.024 --> 01:47:55.357
MARISHA: You think so?

2638
01:47:55.357 --> 01:47:57.007
MATT: "That's one possibility."

2639
01:47:57.007 --> 01:47:59.273
MARISHA: Because we have found absolutely no cooperation

2640
01:47:59.273 --> 01:48:01.033
or evidence between those two.

2641
01:48:01.033 --> 01:48:03.308
MATT: "Hmm. What are you thinking, then?"

2642
01:48:07.104 --> 01:48:11.999
MARISHA: I think that there are individuals on this side

2643
01:48:11.999 --> 01:48:13.934
that might have more interest in what

2644
01:48:13.934 --> 01:48:18.316
the Luxon has to offer, and its heebie-jeebie

2645
01:48:18.316 --> 01:48:22.424
life-extending magic, than

2646
01:48:22.424 --> 01:48:24.375
maybe you anticipated.

2647
01:48:24.375 --> 01:48:26.363
MATT: "That's very possible.

2648
01:48:26.363 --> 01:48:28.142
"But regardless of whatever reasons

2649
01:48:28.142 --> 01:48:29.872
"it may have found its way here,

2650
01:48:29.872 --> 01:48:33.924
"we are willing and eager to return it to them,

2651
01:48:33.924 --> 01:48:37.618
"if it means bringing this
conflict and bloodshed to an end."

2652
01:48:37.618 --> 01:48:40.517
LIAM: This artifact came into your possession recently.

2653
01:48:40.517 --> 01:48:42.709
MATT: "Yes."
LIAM: Yes.

2654
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:47.504
But you've learned a great deal about them, it sounds like.

2655
01:48:47.504 --> 01:48:50.312
There's been no

2656
01:48:50.312 --> 01:48:52.878
previous encounters

2657
01:48:52.878 --> 01:48:57.477
with the Dynasty's knowledge?

2658
01:48:59.148 --> 01:49:00.315
MATT: "In what way?"

2659
01:49:01.221 --> 01:49:04.788
LIAM: This is the first time you've encountered this thing

2660
01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:07.646
you're describing, that Ikithon has told you about.

2661
01:49:07.646 --> 01:49:09.971
MATT: "This beacon? Well, we've heard of them.

2662
01:49:09.971 --> 01:49:14.686
"They carry them like a religious symbols into battle."

2663
01:49:16.089 --> 01:49:17.783
LIAM: And this is the first?

2664
01:49:17.783 --> 01:49:19.740
MATT: "This is the first that we've encountered, yes."

2665
01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:21.050
LIAM: Hmm.

2666
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:23.485
MARISHA: Have you ever spent any time in Xhorhas?

2667
01:49:23.485 --> 01:49:25.380
TALIESIN: Insight motherfucking check on this.

2668
01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:27.438
MATT: Make an insight check, go for it.

2669
01:49:29.626 --> 01:49:31.204
TALIESIN: Almost want to like, give myself a spell for this.

2670
01:49:31.204 --> 01:49:32.911
LAURA: Didn't we see--

2671
01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:33.973
TALIESIN: That's 22.

2672
01:49:33.973 --> 01:49:35.049
MATT: 22, all right.

2673
01:49:35.049 --> 01:49:35.882
SAM: Oh boy.

2674
01:49:35.882 --> 01:49:39.612
LAURA: Wait, we saw him in Zadash.

2675
01:49:39.612 --> 01:49:41.017
SM: Yeah, yes we did.

2676
01:49:41.017 --> 01:49:42.616
The location of all these things.

2677
01:49:42.616 --> 01:49:44.348
LAURA: Yeah, exactly, he fucking knows.

2678
01:49:44.348 --> 01:49:45.998
They've had other ones.

2679
01:49:45.998 --> 01:49:46.831
He's lying.

2680
01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:48.910
LIAM: Hey, DM.

2681
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:50.963
SAM: This whisper brought to you by

2682
01:49:50.963 --> 01:49:54.510
Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.

2683
01:49:55.585 --> 01:49:57.738
MARISHA: You're talking about when the tower

2684
01:49:57.738 --> 01:49:59.604
was attacked in Zadash.
LIAM: I rolled a natural 20.

2685
01:49:59.604 --> 01:50:00.551
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2686
01:50:00.551 --> 01:50:01.496
MATT: Total of?

2687
01:50:01.496 --> 01:50:03.429
LIAM: Oh, for insight?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2688
01:50:03.429 --> 01:50:04.329
LIAM: 28.

2689
01:50:04.329 --> 01:50:05.384
MATT: 28.

2690
01:50:05.384 --> 01:50:06.642
LAURA: Ooh.

2691
01:50:06.642 --> 01:50:10.525
SAM: Repeated whisper to remind you that

2692
01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:16.237
the game's also available on PC, Mac, and Steam.

2693
01:50:16.237 --> 01:50:17.389
TRAVIS: Idle Champions?

2694
01:50:17.389 --> 01:50:20.049
SAM: Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.

2695
01:50:20.049 --> 01:50:24.236
Which I think you can abbreviate as ICOTFR.

2696
01:50:24.236 --> 01:50:25.890
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
SAM: That's how I say it.

2697
01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:27.364
TRAVIS: Now with Arkhan the Cruel, I believe.

2698
01:50:27.364 --> 01:50:30.181
SAM: That's right, and the Vecna skin and feat pack.

2699
01:50:30.181 --> 01:50:31.022
TRAVIS: Ooh.

2700
01:50:31.022 --> 01:50:32.530
LAURA: Ooh!

2701
01:50:38.857 --> 01:50:40.440
TRAVIS: Ludinus.

2702
01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:44.826
This may be quite forward of us.

2703
01:50:44.826 --> 01:50:47.026
I'm sure you can appreciate the danger of us

2704
01:50:47.026 --> 01:50:50.138
sort of traversing lines and putting ourselves

2705
01:50:50.138 --> 01:50:54.117
as the middle man of all this, which we are excited to do.

2706
01:50:54.117 --> 01:50:56.147
MATT: "And I do have my questions on
that as well, but continue."

2707
01:50:56.147 --> 01:50:59.235
TRAVIS: We're sure.
SAM: Are you about to lay down the 10 demands right now?

2708
01:50:59.235 --> 01:51:01.018
TALIESIN: I was going to say,

2709
01:51:01.018 --> 01:51:02.809
do we want to have this conversation now,

2710
01:51:02.809 --> 01:51:07.350
or do we want to find out what your
questions are before--

2711
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:10.597
LAURA: Oh, let's let Fjord say what he's going to say.
TRAVIS: No, please.

2712
01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:11.805
TALIESIN: I mean.

2713
01:51:11.805 --> 01:51:14.314
TRAVIS: We've been doing enough of the talking.

2714
01:51:14.314 --> 01:51:17.781
We should really open it up to more of a discussion, please.

2715
01:51:19.929 --> 01:51:21.979
MATT: "Well, I was going to inquire as to how integrated

2716
01:51:21.979 --> 01:51:24.591
"you are with the Bright Queen, personally.

2717
01:51:24.591 --> 01:51:27.609
"From what we heard and was discussed

2718
01:51:27.609 --> 01:51:29.204
"within the chambers of the King,

2719
01:51:29.204 --> 01:51:32.369
"you seem to have traveled to Xhorhas and made

2720
01:51:32.369 --> 01:51:34.477
"some sort of arrangement, or at least

2721
01:51:34.477 --> 01:51:36.179
"ingratiated yourselves in some way

2722
01:51:36.179 --> 01:51:39.999
"that she trusted the invoking of your name

2723
01:51:39.999 --> 01:51:43.158
"enough to withdraw her troops from a direct attack

2724
01:51:43.158 --> 01:51:46.966
"on the capital. That is quite an arrangement."

2725
01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:49.482
LIAM: I think perhaps she saw--

2726
01:51:49.482 --> 01:51:52.565
it shines through me to,

2727
01:51:53.465 --> 01:51:56.273
as small as it is, to make amends.

2728
01:51:58.692 --> 01:52:01.363
I'm not aware if you know this already,

2729
01:52:01.363 --> 01:52:02.611
although I suspect you do.

2730
01:52:02.611 --> 01:52:06.820
I was once one of Master Ikithon's students.

2731
01:52:07.765 --> 01:52:10.148
MATT: "I was not aware."

2732
01:52:10.148 --> 01:52:11.851
MARISHA: Insight check.

2733
01:52:11.851 --> 01:52:12.822
MATT: Make an insight check.

2734
01:52:12.822 --> 01:52:14.205
MARISHA: You're lying.

2735
01:52:14.205 --> 01:52:15.575
SAM: All these.
MARISHA: No way.

2736
01:52:15.575 --> 01:52:18.622
SAM: We're so trustworthy.
MARISHA: Fuck.

2737
01:52:18.622 --> 01:52:20.055
Why?

2738
01:52:20.967 --> 01:52:24.311
Oh, it's not good.
LAURA: (laughs)

2739
01:52:24.311 --> 01:52:25.144
11.

2740
01:52:26.007 --> 01:52:27.456
MATT: He's hard to read.

2741
01:52:27.456 --> 01:52:29.180
Like a stone wall.

2742
01:52:30.122 --> 01:52:34.163
LIAM: I believe he would see me as

2743
01:52:34.163 --> 01:52:35.703
a bit of a failed experiment.

2744
01:52:35.703 --> 01:52:40.703
I left his tutelage, years ago.

2745
01:52:40.845 --> 01:52:41.678
MATT: "Hmm.

2746
01:52:42.898 --> 01:52:46.468
"Well, you seem to have done well for yourself since then.

2747
01:52:46.468 --> 01:52:49.977
"Trent can be a prickly individual,

2748
01:52:51.097 --> 01:52:55.963
"and his tutelage is not right for everyone."

2749
01:52:57.028 --> 01:53:01.636
LIAM: He's a very clever man, and has much to teach.

2750
01:53:03.942 --> 01:53:06.780
Anyway, to today.

2751
01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:10.570
SAM: To answer your question, we've ingratiated ourselves

2752
01:53:10.570 --> 01:53:13.324
with the Bright Queen quite closely.

2753
01:53:13.324 --> 01:53:16.460
LAURA: Yeah, she has a huge crush on Fjord.

2754
01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:19.480
TALIESIN: Trust might be a very generous word.

2755
01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.144
I wouldn't use it.

2756
01:53:21.144 --> 01:53:22.209
SAM: Don't you see it?

2757
01:53:22.209 --> 01:53:23.451
LIAM: We traveled there because

2758
01:53:23.451 --> 01:53:28.026
our large friend is from there, and we meant to

2759
01:53:30.459 --> 01:53:33.553
win her back from this cult,

2760
01:53:33.553 --> 01:53:38.144
and while we were there, we found ourselves

2761
01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:43.144
captured, and questioned,

2762
01:53:43.444 --> 01:53:45.487
and it became known,

2763
01:53:45.487 --> 01:53:50.020
my connection to Master Ikithon and this city,

2764
01:53:51.056 --> 01:53:54.181
and I am a child of the Empire.

2765
01:53:55.449 --> 01:53:57.199
So is my friend here.

2766
01:53:58.983 --> 01:54:02.041
And I wish to see an end to the war.

2767
01:54:03.228 --> 01:54:04.903
And I think in that moment,

2768
01:54:06.711 --> 01:54:10.860
fearing for my friends' lives,

2769
01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:15.852
I saw a chance to make amends between these two nations.

2770
01:54:18.507 --> 01:54:20.440
And I know that the chance is slim,

2771
01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:24.581
but I would like to see the Assembly

2772
01:54:24.581 --> 01:54:29.506
and the crown to weave their way

2773
01:54:29.506 --> 01:54:33.082
towards an end to this conflict.

2774
01:54:33.082 --> 01:54:36.885
We tried to convince the Bright Queen of the same,

2775
01:54:36.885 --> 01:54:41.885
and while she was wary and rightly skeptical,

2776
01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:46.523
she did take a small chance on us.

2777
01:54:47.643 --> 01:54:51.645
MATT: "How confident are you that you would be able to

2778
01:54:51.645 --> 01:54:56.622
"reach further this time, to bridge this gap

2779
01:54:56.622 --> 01:54:59.980
"that you seem so interested in doing?"

2780
01:55:01.201 --> 01:55:03.335
LIAM: Well, you know, she keeps us at arm's length.

2781
01:55:03.335 --> 01:55:08.335
She's the ruler of a large and powerful place,

2782
01:55:08.527 --> 01:55:11.994
but we have made connections.

2783
01:55:13.174 --> 01:55:15.507
They trust us up to a point.

2784
01:55:17.651 --> 01:55:20.810
MARISHA: We've already asked her questions

2785
01:55:21.744 --> 01:55:25.027
on if we got

2786
01:55:25.027 --> 01:55:30.027
this item back, if it would end the war.

2787
01:55:33.032 --> 01:55:35.677
We heard all the things you just listed

2788
01:55:35.677 --> 01:55:38.453
from her perspective.

2789
01:55:38.453 --> 01:55:42.265
Seems she's also pretty pissed at the years and years

2790
01:55:42.265 --> 01:55:46.196
and years of conflict between borders,

2791
01:55:46.196 --> 01:55:50.009
and those Empire agents that you mentioned

2792
01:55:50.009 --> 01:55:53.617
trying to keep the peace over in Xhorhas,

2793
01:55:53.617 --> 01:55:57.345
she didn't really take kindly to,

2794
01:55:57.345 --> 01:56:00.712
or see from your perspective, I think.

2795
01:56:00.712 --> 01:56:03.070
MATT: "Well, we didn't take kindly to them

2796
01:56:03.070 --> 01:56:06.611
"infiltrating some of our populace

2797
01:56:06.611 --> 01:56:10.194
"and spreading their religious drivel."

2798
01:56:10.194 --> 01:56:14.502
LIAM: Martinet, both sides are peopled

2799
01:56:14.502 --> 01:56:19.502
with very intelligent, crafty individuals.

2800
01:56:19.804 --> 01:56:20.637
MATT: "Of course,

2801
01:56:20.637 --> 01:56:25.333
"and those individuals can exist together

2802
01:56:25.333 --> 01:56:30.221
"in a very delicately arranged balance

2803
01:56:30.221 --> 01:56:32.771
"of mutually assured...

2804
01:56:35.479 --> 01:56:36.845
"benevolence."

2805
01:56:38.977 --> 01:56:41.683
LIAM: I beseech you.

2806
01:56:41.683 --> 01:56:46.051
What happened in that temple is a sign

2807
01:56:46.051 --> 01:56:50.776
of worse things to come, and they are far worse

2808
01:56:51.826 --> 01:56:55.785
than any grabs for an inch more of power.

2809
01:56:58.465 --> 01:57:00.718
I hope you hear me.

2810
01:57:00.718 --> 01:57:03.094
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2811
01:57:08.891 --> 01:57:09.987
LIAM: 16.

2812
01:57:09.987 --> 01:57:10.820
MATT: Okay.

2813
01:57:14.632 --> 01:57:17.217
"What are your thoughts on the approach

2814
01:57:17.217 --> 01:57:18.609
"to the Bright Queen?

2815
01:57:18.609 --> 01:57:20.922
"How do you plan to take this to her?"

2816
01:57:20.922 --> 01:57:23.619
TALIESIN: She knows we serve peace.

2817
01:57:23.619 --> 01:57:25.472
She's always been comfortable with the fact

2818
01:57:25.472 --> 01:57:28.399
that we were not really hers.

2819
01:57:28.399 --> 01:57:31.077
She knows what we want.

2820
01:57:31.077 --> 01:57:33.690
SAM: We can certainly make our way back there,

2821
01:57:33.690 --> 01:57:36.828
but if you have means of travel to and from

2822
01:57:36.828 --> 01:57:39.082
that are quicker, we wouldn't--

2823
01:57:39.082 --> 01:57:41.720
MATT: "I highly doubt we do, and the travel in doing so

2824
01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:45.279
"would probably put somebody not as trusted as yourselves

2825
01:57:45.279 --> 01:57:46.889
"in the line of fire.

2826
01:57:46.889 --> 01:57:48.456
"I think if you've been there as many times

2827
01:57:48.456 --> 01:57:50.991
"as you appear to have, you may have

2828
01:57:50.991 --> 01:57:54.660
"a much better chance at arriving without issue."

2829
01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:57.603
LIAM: Are you trusting us to handle this issue ourselves?

2830
01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:58.921
The nine of us?

2831
01:57:58.921 --> 01:58:01.170
MATT: "For the initial discussion, yes."

2832
01:58:01.170 --> 01:58:02.698
TRAVIS: Martinet, forgive this question,

2833
01:58:02.698 --> 01:58:05.447
the entrance into this chamber was quite dramatic.

2834
01:58:05.447 --> 01:58:07.248
I'm assuming our conversation here

2835
01:58:07.248 --> 01:58:09.846
is protected from outside eyes?

2836
01:58:09.846 --> 01:58:10.679
MATT: "All of it."

2837
01:58:10.679 --> 01:58:12.228
TRAVIS: Wonderful.

2838
01:58:12.228 --> 01:58:14.188
I think it'll be a very slow process.

2839
01:58:14.188 --> 01:58:16.861
I think the offering of a chance of this beacon

2840
01:58:16.861 --> 01:58:20.323
will provoke some interest, with caution.

2841
01:58:20.323 --> 01:58:22.476
I would then think we would need to secure

2842
01:58:22.476 --> 01:58:25.036
a neutral location where they don't feel exposed

2843
01:58:25.036 --> 01:58:27.663
and neither does the King.

2844
01:58:27.663 --> 01:58:30.412
But I don't promise any sort of a timeline,

2845
01:58:30.412 --> 01:58:33.227
or a deliverable, in any sort of way.

2846
01:58:33.227 --> 01:58:35.485
MATT: "I do not believe it needs to be immediate,

2847
01:58:35.485 --> 01:58:37.040
but time is of the essence.

2848
01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:41.240
"This current tenuous ceasefire

2849
01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:43.597
"only lasts as long as the good will

2850
01:58:43.597 --> 01:58:46.372
"of your friend Allura's recent warning,

2851
01:58:46.372 --> 01:58:49.485
"and perhaps this meeting you're having, might allow.

2852
01:58:49.485 --> 01:58:53.010
"That could be days, weeks at most.

2853
01:58:53.010 --> 01:58:57.358
"So whatever you do, and decide to do, keep that in mind."

2854
01:58:57.358 --> 01:59:01.942
TALIESIN: Something we could bring, before we get into

2855
01:59:01.942 --> 01:59:03.442
other discussions.

2856
01:59:04.572 --> 01:59:06.738
I'm sure they might be grateful to have

2857
01:59:06.738 --> 01:59:11.563
whatever intel we've currently collected

2858
01:59:11.563 --> 01:59:14.985
on this cult

2859
01:59:14.985 --> 01:59:17.005
and some of its dealings over here so that

2860
01:59:17.005 --> 01:59:19.070
they could see that this problem

2861
01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:22.264
is on both sides of the border. That was a--

2862
01:59:22.264 --> 01:59:24.735
MATT: "So you know this cult has had its own influences

2863
01:59:24.735 --> 01:59:26.719
"on the Xhorhasian side as well?"

2864
01:59:26.719 --> 01:59:27.924
TALIESIN: Very much so.

2865
01:59:27.924 --> 01:59:30.262
LAURA: They were opening up portals over there as well.

2866
01:59:30.262 --> 01:59:32.174
MATT: "Then that is very much a good direction

2867
01:59:32.174 --> 01:59:34.628
"to take this conversation.

2868
01:59:34.628 --> 01:59:38.756
"Mutual enemies can make for fast and strange allies,

2869
01:59:38.756 --> 01:59:40.192
"at certain times."

2870
01:59:40.192 --> 01:59:42.712
TRAVIS: Do you have perhaps a seal that
we could take with us?

2871
01:59:42.712 --> 01:59:44.351
Something that shows that we have made contact

2872
01:59:44.351 --> 01:59:46.384
with the powers that be of Empire and shows that they are--

2873
01:59:46.384 --> 01:59:48.568
MATT: "That can be provided."
TRAVIS: Wonderful.

2874
01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:53.510
LAURA: Do you think in future meetings,

2875
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:56.252
with you or anyone else,

2876
01:59:56.252 --> 02:00:00.771
that we could have pastries and/or chocolate available?

2877
02:00:00.771 --> 02:00:03.453
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2878
02:00:03.453 --> 02:00:06.021
TRAVIS: I will assist her.
MATT: Okay.

2879
02:00:06.021 --> 02:00:07.181
LAURA: Natural one.

2880
02:00:07.181 --> 02:00:09.071
(laughter)

2881
02:00:09.071 --> 02:00:12.499
MATT: Fjord said-- before you rolled, before you rolled--

2882
02:00:12.499 --> 02:00:13.946
he did say he was going to assist you,

2883
02:00:13.946 --> 02:00:15.809
so you get advantage on the roll.
LAURA: I'm just going to roll the same one.

2884
02:00:15.809 --> 02:00:17.401
SAM: Come on, come on, come on 20, come on 20.

2885
02:00:18.426 --> 02:00:20.517
LAURA: Oh, that's pretty good.

2886
02:00:20.517 --> 02:00:22.609
(laughs)

2887
02:00:22.609 --> 02:00:24.175
19.

2888
02:00:26.704 --> 02:00:28.454
TALIESIN: She's very serious.

2889
02:00:30.108 --> 02:00:30.941
MATT: "Truly?"

2890
02:00:32.568 --> 02:00:35.560
You see him taken aback, like--

2891
02:00:36.701 --> 02:00:38.092
MATT: "Very well."

2892
02:00:38.092 --> 02:00:39.992
TRAVIS: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Good ask, good ask.

2893
02:00:39.992 --> 02:00:42.600
LAURA: (whispering) Thank you, hard line.

2894
02:00:46.055 --> 02:00:48.255
That's like two of the lines.

2895
02:00:48.255 --> 02:00:51.334
TALIESIN: We are definitely going to have to have

2896
02:00:51.334 --> 02:00:56.326
a discussion about how this beacon thing got into--

2897
02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:00.403
TRAVIS: I think if perhaps we see it, that'll be the time.

2898
02:01:00.403 --> 02:01:03.748
TALIESIN: That'll be the conversation to have,
if it really is it.

2899
02:01:03.748 --> 02:01:05.744
MATT: "Then we'll have it at the time.

2900
02:01:05.744 --> 02:01:08.684
"Perhaps after this meeting."

2901
02:01:08.684 --> 02:01:11.505
SAM: I don't think there's anything else
to discuss right now.

2902
02:01:11.505 --> 02:01:14.651
MATT: "Well, I'm mildly curious, have you put any thought

2903
02:01:14.651 --> 02:01:18.018
"to such a location of neutrality--"
LAURA: Well--

2904
02:01:18.018 --> 02:01:20.747
MATT: "-- that might be recommended for this gathering?

2905
02:01:20.747 --> 02:01:22.503
TALIESIN: I had an idea, but that's--

2906
02:01:22.503 --> 02:01:24.056
TRAVIS: Go ahead, what's your idea?

2907
02:01:24.056 --> 02:01:25.897
TALIESIN: I mean, I don't even know if I want to.

2908
02:01:25.897 --> 02:01:27.293
TRAVIS: You definitely want to say it.

2909
02:01:27.293 --> 02:01:29.684
TALIESIN: I want to run it by you first,
because it's kind of crazy.

2910
02:01:29.684 --> 02:01:30.517
MATT: "Speak up, please."

2911
02:01:30.517 --> 02:01:32.841
TRAVIS: I think I know what you're thinking.
LIAM: I do too.

2912
02:01:32.841 --> 02:01:34.493
SAM: I don't at all.
TALIESIN: Am I crazy for thinking it?

2913
02:01:34.493 --> 02:01:38.404
SAM: I don't know, what are you guys thinking?
LAURA: What are you thinking?!

2914
02:01:38.404 --> 02:01:39.577
SAM: On the deck of a ship?

2915
02:01:39.577 --> 02:01:41.520
LAURA: Come on, we'll say it at the same time.

2916
02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:45.186
TALIESIN: We do have a pocket dimension.

2917
02:01:45.186 --> 02:01:46.117
LAURA: Oh.

2918
02:01:46.117 --> 02:01:49.463
TALIESIN: We could do it in the Happy Fun Ball.

2919
02:01:49.463 --> 02:01:50.392
MARISHA: No.

2920
02:01:50.392 --> 02:01:51.925
SAM: Seems unnecessary.

2921
02:01:51.925 --> 02:01:54.398
TALIESIN: Now hear me out.
MATT: "What is the 'happy fun ball'?"

2922
02:01:54.398 --> 02:01:55.948
TALIESIN: One second.
MARISHA: No.

2923
02:01:55.948 --> 02:01:58.706
TALIESIN: Hear me out, hear me out.

2924
02:01:59.705 --> 02:02:03.194
It's territory we control, it's impossible to--

2925
02:02:03.194 --> 02:02:05.417
LAURA: Do we, though?

2926
02:02:05.417 --> 02:02:08.437
TALIESIN: As long as we stick to just one room--

2927
02:02:08.437 --> 02:02:10.053
MATT: "What is the happy fun ball?"

2928
02:02:10.053 --> 02:02:11.081
TRAVIS: Apologies--

2929
02:02:11.081 --> 02:02:13.541
TALIESIN: And there's no outside influence, I'm just saying.

2930
02:02:13.541 --> 02:02:15.367
I've been thinking about it.

2931
02:02:15.367 --> 02:02:20.118
TRAVIS: An arcane item that carries some
inter-planar space within it, it's--

2932
02:02:20.118 --> 02:02:22.142
MATT: "Where is this?"

2933
02:02:22.142 --> 02:02:23.902
MARISHA: It's no big deal, don't worry about it.

2934
02:02:23.902 --> 02:02:27.227
I think there are easier ways.

2935
02:02:27.227 --> 02:02:28.689
TALIESIN: I'm still putting it out there.

2936
02:02:28.689 --> 02:02:33.689
SAM: The item is far, far away, and we can't,

2937
02:02:33.849 --> 02:02:37.690
it's not the greatest idea because it's dangerous.

2938
02:02:37.690 --> 02:02:39.854
TALIESIN: Of course it's dangerous.
MARISHA: It's complicated.

2939
02:02:39.854 --> 02:02:43.521
LAURA: What about if we had it on a volcano?

2940
02:02:44.883 --> 02:02:46.991
SAM: She's not, this is actually a better plan

2941
02:02:46.991 --> 02:02:48.977
than she's selling it.

2942
02:02:48.977 --> 02:02:51.312
MATT: Every expression, whenever Jester speaks up,

2943
02:02:51.312 --> 02:02:53.884
is a look and bewilderment and confusion,

2944
02:02:53.884 --> 02:02:55.618
and generally the only time in this meeting

2945
02:02:55.618 --> 02:03:00.618
you've seen him thrown off. Every reaction is--

2946
02:03:01.217 --> 02:03:03.852
SAM: There's an island, there's a volcano island,

2947
02:03:03.852 --> 02:03:05.812
that's neutral territory, not controlled

2948
02:03:05.812 --> 02:03:07.346
by either Dynasty or Empire.

2949
02:03:07.346 --> 02:03:10.036
We wouldn't be on a volcano like in the middle

2950
02:03:10.036 --> 02:03:11.834
of the hot part of it, right?

2951
02:03:11.834 --> 02:03:14.500
We would be down--
LAURA: I honestly don't know.

2952
02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:15.699
TALIESIN: Seems like a weird idea.

2953
02:03:15.699 --> 02:03:17.493
MARISHA: Why don't we just go on our boat?

2954
02:03:17.493 --> 02:03:19.321
LAURA: What about on a boat?!

2955
02:03:19.321 --> 02:03:23.121
LIAM: The Menagerie Coast is neutral.
SAM and MARISHA: International waters.

2956
02:03:23.121 --> 02:03:26.203
LAURA: We'd have to stay away from the pirate island,

2957
02:03:26.203 --> 02:03:27.113
because they don't like us.

2958
02:03:27.113 --> 02:03:29.443
TRAVIS: Come on, let's go to Darktow, let them host it!

2959
02:03:29.443 --> 02:03:31.051
It'll be amazing!
LAURA: I could send a message.

2960
02:03:31.051 --> 02:03:32.837
MARISHA: We were told not to come back to Darktow,

2961
02:03:32.837 --> 02:03:36.221
or else we would be decapitated.
LAURA: What if I send a message to the Plank King?

2962
02:03:36.221 --> 02:03:37.829
MATT: "You've recommended...

2963
02:03:39.187 --> 02:03:43.384
"a volcano, and Darktow."

2964
02:03:43.384 --> 02:03:45.176
TRAVIS: Or the Savalirwood.
ASHLEY: And the fun ball.

2965
02:03:45.176 --> 02:03:46.904
TALIESIN: It's a very fun ball.

2966
02:03:46.904 --> 02:03:48.238
MATT: "Savalirwood.

2967
02:03:48.238 --> 02:03:51.225
"These are three extremely dangerous locations

2968
02:03:51.225 --> 02:03:53.100
"you've offered already."

2969
02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:54.801
TRAVIS: Yes, you'd both have to come

2970
02:03:54.801 --> 02:03:57.527
very well prepared to defend yourselves,

2971
02:03:57.527 --> 02:04:00.049
neither having an advantage in any of the three spaces.

2972
02:04:00.049 --> 02:04:00.882
LAURA: Maybe we should go to Allura.

2973
02:04:00.882 --> 02:04:04.023
Maybe she had a good idea.
SAM: Do you know anyone on the Tal'Dorei Council?

2974
02:04:04.023 --> 02:04:07.107
Besides Allura, because we could have it there.

2975
02:04:07.107 --> 02:04:08.708
TALIESIN: Do you know what the Tal'Dorei Council is?

2976
02:04:08.708 --> 02:04:10.158
Because people keep saying that to me

2977
02:04:10.158 --> 02:04:11.457
and I have got no idea what it is.

2978
02:04:11.457 --> 02:04:13.178
MATT: "I know of it, but I have not had any

2979
02:04:13.178 --> 02:04:15.971
"specific dealings with them besides this Allura Vysoren."

2980
02:04:15.971 --> 02:04:18.226
TRAVIS: If you want to have a little bit
more of an advantage,

2981
02:04:18.226 --> 02:04:20.639
of course the Rockguard Garrison

2982
02:04:20.639 --> 02:04:23.223
sort of borders between both spaces, yes?

2983
02:04:23.223 --> 02:04:26.164
MATT: "It does, but it is entirely--

2984
02:04:26.164 --> 02:04:27.989
"both garrisons as of recently

2985
02:04:27.989 --> 02:04:29.705
"are now back under our control.

2986
02:04:29.705 --> 02:04:31.313
"I wouldn't consider that neutral territory."

2987
02:04:31.313 --> 02:04:34.018
LIAM: How would you feel about traveling
to the Menagerie Coast?

2988
02:04:34.018 --> 02:04:35.815
MATT: "I'm all right with that."

2989
02:04:35.815 --> 02:04:37.131
SAM: Oh, all right.

2990
02:04:37.131 --> 02:04:39.749
LAURA: We could host everyone at the Lavish Chateau.

2991
02:04:39.749 --> 02:04:41.291
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: Huh.

2992
02:04:41.291 --> 02:04:43.792
LAURA: And then my mom could sing to them.

2993
02:04:43.792 --> 02:04:46.431
TALIESIN: That feels dangerous.

2994
02:04:46.431 --> 02:04:48.572
MARISHA: I don't think we want anything personal.

2995
02:04:48.572 --> 02:04:50.902
TRAVIS: I don't think you want to bring
them near your mother.

2996
02:04:50.902 --> 02:04:53.124
SAM: But think of the business you
could bring to the Chateau.

2997
02:04:53.124 --> 02:04:53.979
LAURA: Yes.

2998
02:04:53.979 --> 02:04:58.979
TALIESIN: Think of all the random people.
MARISHA: I'm kind of into the boat idea.

2999
02:04:59.350 --> 02:05:03.798
We own a nice boat. It's a nice boat. It's a pirate boat

3000
02:05:03.798 --> 02:05:05.973
that we inherited. That we stole.
MATT: "What's it called?"

3001
02:05:05.973 --> 02:05:08.640
MARISHA: That we got. Mm-hmm.
SAM: It's called the Balleater.

3002
02:05:10.917 --> 02:05:15.160
(laughing) It's a long story.

3003
02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:18.478
It used to be called the Squalleater--

3004
02:05:18.478 --> 02:05:20.237
SAM and LAURA: -- but we changed it.

3005
02:05:20.237 --> 02:05:22.678
MATT: He immediately looks to Jester.

3006
02:05:22.678 --> 02:05:24.737
SAM: Yeah, Jester changed it.

3007
02:05:25.655 --> 02:05:26.575
MARISHA: Yeah.

3008
02:05:26.575 --> 02:05:27.850
MATT: "I see.

3009
02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:30.437
"I'm beginning to understand quite clearly

3010
02:05:30.437 --> 02:05:32.426
"who I'm working with."

3011
02:05:32.426 --> 02:05:34.310
LAURA: Oh, but don't get the wrong impression,

3012
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:36.219
we're super capable.

3013
02:05:36.219 --> 02:05:40.058
MATT: "Oh, I in no way, shape,
or form had assumed otherwise.

3014
02:05:40.058 --> 02:05:42.543
LIAM: Perhaps a few miles outside the city of Nicodranas

3015
02:05:42.543 --> 02:05:47.543
on the Menagerie Coast, away from prying eyes.

3016
02:05:47.566 --> 02:05:48.627
MATT: "That seems viable."

3017
02:05:48.627 --> 02:05:50.763
MARISHA: On the ocean, on a boat.

3018
02:05:50.763 --> 02:05:54.004
MATT: "There are a few options I was also considering."

3019
02:05:54.004 --> 02:05:55.518
LAURA: Oh, yes, tell us yours.

3020
02:05:55.518 --> 02:05:57.091
MATT: "Outside of Nicodranas may work well.

3021
02:05:57.091 --> 02:06:00.468
"The Menagerie Coast is more neutral territory,

3022
02:06:00.468 --> 02:06:02.485
"and away from any of the current places

3023
02:06:02.485 --> 02:06:04.793
"of existing conflict.

3024
02:06:05.749 --> 02:06:10.749
"A boat or ship would also bring us to neutral territory,

3025
02:06:10.965 --> 02:06:13.140
"though depending on the size of the forces

3026
02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:14.514
"that would be coming to the negotiation,

3027
02:06:14.514 --> 02:06:17.202
"I do not know if it would be able to keep it,

3028
02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:22.202
"as I assume both the King and the Bright Queen would be

3029
02:06:22.898 --> 02:06:26.148
"keen on bringing some form of sizable defense,

3030
02:06:26.148 --> 02:06:27.933
"in case things were to go awry."

3031
02:06:27.933 --> 02:06:29.577
LAURA: Ooh, it sounds like something could--

3032
02:06:29.577 --> 02:06:31.202
What if they both leave their territories

3033
02:06:31.202 --> 02:06:34.449
and then the Chained Oblivion attacks at the same time?!

3034
02:06:34.449 --> 02:06:36.044
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: They're not going to leave ev--

3035
02:06:36.044 --> 02:06:38.166
They're going to leave some people behind, right?

3036
02:06:38.166 --> 02:06:41.193
MARISHA: But the point of doing this on neutral territory

3037
02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:45.465
was to not have a display of military force.

3038
02:06:45.465 --> 02:06:46.465
MATT: "Of course.

3039
02:06:47.429 --> 02:06:49.427
"But you do realize that they're not going to go

3040
02:06:49.427 --> 02:06:51.158
"completely unprotected either."

3041
02:06:51.158 --> 02:06:53.050
MARISHA: They don't have to go completely unprotected,

3042
02:06:53.050 --> 02:06:56.193
but I think a very select number of people

3043
02:06:56.193 --> 02:06:59.982
is wise when having a peace treaty conversation.

3044
02:06:59.982 --> 02:07:01.003
MARISHA: "Mm-hmm."

3045
02:07:01.003 --> 02:07:03.813
LIAM: You're not talking about having King Dwendal

3046
02:07:03.813 --> 02:07:06.254
and the Bright Queen meet somewhere,

3047
02:07:06.254 --> 02:07:07.995
are you?
LAURA: Are we?

3048
02:07:07.995 --> 02:07:09.863
SAM: Yes, yeah, I think that's what we are saying.

3049
02:07:09.863 --> 02:07:12.128
TALIESIN: Or are we just talking about representatives?

3050
02:07:12.128 --> 02:07:16.079
LIAM: Why would the king wish to expose himself like that,

3051
02:07:16.079 --> 02:07:18.760
instead of staying here in the seat of power?

3052
02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:21.621
MATT: "No, I'm just saying,
whatever situation of negotiation

3053
02:07:21.621 --> 02:07:25.452
"you present, there's going to be some sort of a force

3054
02:07:25.452 --> 02:07:27.337
"that's going to want to protect

3055
02:07:27.337 --> 02:07:29.471
"whoever's making this negotiation.

3056
02:07:29.471 --> 02:07:31.098
"Whoever shows up to this negotiation,

3057
02:07:31.098 --> 02:07:33.744
"well, that depends on how well it goes

3058
02:07:33.744 --> 02:07:36.482
"and what seems to be best for the arrangements

3059
02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:37.879
"you've arranged."

3060
02:07:37.879 --> 02:07:40.823
LIAM: But if you're thinking it, I don't think

3061
02:07:40.823 --> 02:07:42.627
we're going to have an easy time to coax

3062
02:07:42.627 --> 02:07:46.914
the Bright Queen herself to visit anywhere.

3063
02:07:46.914 --> 02:07:50.914
You are going to be dealing with intermediaries.

3064
02:07:52.982 --> 02:07:55.871
SAM: You can also do the Ashguard Garrison, you know,

3065
02:07:55.871 --> 02:07:58.121
if you don't want to go to the boat thing.

3066
02:07:58.121 --> 02:07:59.345
TALIESIN: I like the boat.

3067
02:07:59.345 --> 02:08:01.686
MATT: "The Ashguard Garrison has recently been the location

3068
02:08:01.686 --> 02:08:04.255
"of quite a bit of a battle, and perhaps would be

3069
02:08:04.255 --> 02:08:09.230
"a sore spot, based on the bloodshed lost on both sides.

3070

"Eiselcross maybe a bit too cold,

3074
02:08:24.612 --> 02:08:29.487
"so I think that will take us where we need to be."

3075
02:08:29.487 --> 02:08:32.570
TRAVIS: It'll also, of course,
depend on feedback from the Dynasty,

3076
02:08:32.570 --> 02:08:35.887
but we will certainly float those at the top of the list.

3077
02:08:35.887 --> 02:08:36.887
MATT: "All right."

3078
02:08:38.369 --> 02:08:39.202
TRAVIS: No.

3079
02:08:39.202 --> 02:08:43.375
TRAVIS: Oh, I see. You said float, nevermind. I don't care.

3080
02:08:43.375 --> 02:08:45.855
SAM: Should we go see this beacony thing, then?

3081
02:08:45.855 --> 02:08:46.905
MATT: "Yes.

3082
02:08:46.905 --> 02:08:51.905
"I just wanted to say also, is, as part of this

3083
02:08:52.284 --> 02:08:56.376
"arrangement that we are crafting together.

3085
02:09:00.389 --> 02:09:03.041
"quite a bit of tension and mistrust here,

"my interest in seeing this done properly,

"has been responsible for quite a

"unfortunate incidence in Zadash."

3094
02:09:37.554 --> 02:09:38.821
TALIESIN: That's a perspective.

3095
02:09:38.821 --> 02:09:42.102
TRAVIS: Yeah, we totally fucking
skipped that part of the trap.

3096
02:09:43.727 --> 02:09:44.580
MATT: "Well."

3097
02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:47.870
LAURA: She wasn't under her own control, you know.

3098
02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:50.812
MATT: "I trust that may be the case.

3099
02:09:50.812 --> 02:09:53.911
"However, the investigation

"this individual's involvement.

3105
02:10:14.684 --> 02:10:18.461
"So for the time being, and perhaps

3106
02:10:18.461 --> 02:10:21.671
"for the foreseeable future, you should be fine."

3107
02:10:21.671 --> 02:10:22.504
LAURA: Wow.

3108
02:10:23.362 --> 02:10:25.381
ASHLEY: Thank you for doing that.

3109
02:10:25.381 --> 02:10:28.881
You didn't need to do that, but thank you.

3110
02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:32.289
MARISHA: Okay.

3111
02:10:32.289 --> 02:10:35.584
TALIESIN: The site of the battle.

3112
02:10:35.584 --> 02:10:37.243
What's become of it?

3113
02:10:38.871 --> 02:10:40.413
MATT: "Of the city itself?"

3114
02:10:40.413 --> 02:10:43.413
TALIESIN: Of the temple beneath.
LIAM: The temple underneath it.

3115
02:10:43.413 --> 02:10:46.186
MARISHA: The Chantry.
MATT: "The Chantry.

3116
02:10:46.186 --> 02:10:49.608
"There has been a heavy amount of investigation

3117
02:10:49.608 --> 02:10:52.677
"over the evening, acquiring what remnants

02:10:52.677 --> 02:10:57.013
"of the individual that you slew,
known as Obann, I believe it was."

3119
02:10:57.013 --> 02:10:58.463
LAURA: The Punished!

3120
02:11:01.332 --> 02:11:03.961
MATT: "Unbeknownst to really any of us,

3121
02:11:03.961 --> 02:11:08.961
"the shackle beneath the Chantry is intact.

3122
02:11:09.283 --> 02:11:10.711
"So.

3123
02:11:10.711 --> 02:11:12.811
"And some of the research that has come up

3124
02:11:12.811 --> 02:11:15.397
"regarding this, from the Cobalt Soul,

3125
02:11:15.397 --> 02:11:19.285
"and, I believe, some of which was spoken upon your arrival,

"the other shackles still remain a mystery and unfound,

3127
02:11:22.429 --> 02:11:24.531
"which is safe."

3128
02:11:24.531 --> 02:11:27.882
MARISHA: And refresh me one more time,

3129
02:11:27.882 --> 02:11:31.855
who did you say was leading the investigation?

3130
02:11:31.855 --> 02:11:33.342
You mentioned her earlier.

3131
02:11:33.342 --> 02:11:34.973
MATT: "I don't know who specifically it was,

3132
02:11:34.973 --> 02:11:38.306
"but it's just the Archive of Zadash was."

3133
02:11:39.368 --> 02:11:42.337
MARISHA: And the Cerberus Assembly,
is that what you said earlier?

3134
02:11:42.337 --> 02:11:44.903
MATT: "No, they've just arrived through the night.

3135
02:11:44.903 --> 02:11:48.015
MARISHA: Who did you say, you said research was happening?

3136
02:11:48.015 --> 02:11:49.812
Marisha to DM question.
MATT: Yes.

3137
02:11:49.812 --> 02:11:51.645
MARISHA: Did you say Ogden?

3138
02:11:51.645 --> 02:11:54.232
Was Ogden something you said?

3139
02:11:54.232 --> 02:11:56.977
MATT: May have been a miscommunication.

3140
02:11:56.977 --> 02:11:58.581
MARISHA: Okay.

3141
02:11:58.581 --> 02:12:00.042
TRAVIS: Insight check.

3142
02:12:00.042 --> 02:12:03.542
(Laura and Matt laughing)

3143
02:12:05.521 --> 02:12:10.521
MATT: "But the threat and the extent of it is being researched.

3144
02:12:10.702 --> 02:12:15.168
"Nobody wants a cult of Tharizdun

3145
02:12:15.168 --> 02:12:17.349
"to be given free reign."

3146
02:12:17.349 --> 02:12:19.250
TRAVIS: I hope not.

3147
02:12:19.250 --> 02:12:22.732
MATT: "That does not bode well for anyone.

3148
02:12:22.732 --> 02:12:24.240
"And we are looking into it.

3149
02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:26.956
"We are seeking out the

3150
02:12:26.956 --> 02:12:30.772
"details of who has been involved,

3151
02:12:30.772 --> 02:12:34.724
"and rounding them up to be judged

3152
02:12:34.724 --> 02:12:37.244
"and punished appropriately."

3153
02:12:37.244 --> 02:12:39.431
LAURA: We found a lot of people involved.

3154
02:12:39.431 --> 02:12:42.355
MATT: "Well, it seems that the ones locally

3155
02:12:42.355 --> 02:12:46.505
"were largely handled by you lot

3156
02:12:46.505 --> 02:12:48.155
"and a number of our Righteous Brand

3157
02:12:48.155 --> 02:12:51.942
"and the Cobalt Soul, upon arrival.

3158
02:12:51.942 --> 02:12:54.894
"But if what they've done spans the globe,

3159
02:12:54.894 --> 02:12:56.727
"this is information that needs to be pursued.

3160
02:12:56.727 --> 02:12:59.111
"So we are also reaching out and sending missives

3161
02:12:59.111 --> 02:13:03.602
"to other countries and other governments

3162
02:13:03.602 --> 02:13:05.394
"to at least follow these same signs,

3163
02:13:05.394 --> 02:13:07.865
"and thankfully it looks like their involvement

3164
02:13:07.865 --> 02:13:09.366
"is relatively small, and that's how they were able

3165
02:13:09.366 --> 02:13:11.801
"to work unnoticed for so long.

3166
02:13:11.801 --> 02:13:15.903
"Any larger, you probably would've seen signs a lot sooner."

3167
02:13:15.903 --> 02:13:20.306
TRAVIS: I know your investigation
is into this particular shackle.

3168
02:13:20.306 --> 02:13:21.997
Would it be too much to ask that,

3169
02:13:21.997 --> 02:13:24.978
perhaps whoever's involved, try and put some thought

3170
02:13:24.978 --> 02:13:27.113
into where the other shackles might be,

3171
02:13:27.113 --> 02:13:30.034
based upon what you find in there?

3172
02:13:30.034 --> 02:13:31.275
MATT: "Certainly."

3173
02:13:31.275 --> 02:13:33.239
TRAVIS: Defending those positions or preventing them

3174
02:13:33.239 --> 02:13:37.093
from discovery would, I think, go a long way.

3175
02:13:37.093 --> 02:13:38.551
MATT: "I've reached out to Vasselheim.

3176
02:13:38.551 --> 02:13:40.003
"They would probably be the individuals

3177
02:13:40.003 --> 02:13:42.352
"having the most information.

3178
02:13:42.352 --> 02:13:47.061
"But it hasn't been but a day since the occurrences,

02:13:47.061 --> 02:13:49.845
"and responses can be delayed."

3180
02:13:52.264 --> 02:13:56.722
LAURA: If you Send a message,
you can get an immediate response.

3181
02:13:56.722 --> 02:14:00.061
Short, but--
MATT: "That is what I generally do."

3182
02:14:00.061 --> 02:14:01.144
LAURA: Oh.

3183
02:14:02.294 --> 02:14:03.957
MATT: "But there's a bit of a bureaucracy,

3184
02:14:03.957 --> 02:14:08.957
"and, to be honest, a historical lack of...

3185
02:14:11.169 --> 02:14:16.169
"generosity and exuberance from the line of kings.

3186
02:14:16.398 --> 02:14:21.004
"So Vasselheim needs to warm up to these

02:14:21.004 --> 02:14:26.004
"revelations from the Empire before they'll be forthcoming."

3188
02:14:26.291 --> 02:14:27.124
LAURA: Right.

3189
02:14:28.138 --> 02:14:30.254
MATT: "And, of course,

3193
02:14:37.761 --> 02:14:39.842
TRAVIS: Certainly.
LIAM: Insight check!

3194
02:14:39.842 --> 02:14:40.748
MATT: Make an insight check.

3195
02:14:40.748 --> 02:14:42.513
LAURA: Ooh, I wonder if he knows.

3196
02:14:42.513 --> 02:14:44.845
TRAVIS: Do I believe him?

3197
02:14:46.304 --> 02:14:48.509
LIAM: 23!

3198
02:14:48.509 --> 02:14:50.019
SAM: More whispers?
LAURA: Oh, I bet he knows the location of them

3199
02:14:50.019 --> 02:14:53.211
and he just doesn't want to tell us right now.

3200
02:14:53.211 --> 02:14:55.565
SAM: Idlechampions.com/criticalrole

3201
02:14:55.565 --> 02:14:58.070
is where he can get more information.

3202
02:14:58.070 --> 02:14:59.372
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3203
02:14:59.372 --> 02:15:04.262
SAM: Don't forget, if you were a fan of Standup Santa,

3204
02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:08.354
just ask for him back, and he'll come.

3205
02:15:08.354 --> 02:15:09.942
LAURA: Is that something that I missed and I'm glad?

3206
02:15:09.942 --> 02:15:12.144
SAM: Yes, you should be happy that you did.

3207
02:15:12.144 --> 02:15:14.744
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

3208
02:15:15.847 --> 02:15:18.317
Your expression would've been like the one on Sam's shirt.

3209
02:15:18.317 --> 02:15:20.104
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Which one?

3210
02:15:20.104 --> 02:15:20.937
TRAVIS: That one.

3211
02:15:20.937 --> 02:15:23.043
TALIESIN: All of them, oh.

3212
02:15:23.043 --> 02:15:25.545
LIAM: That's the happiest I ever was.

3213
02:15:25.545 --> 02:15:27.742
(laughter)

3214
02:15:27.742 --> 02:15:31.933
MATT: "Well, I guess we would make our way

3215
02:15:31.933 --> 02:15:34.591
"to confirm the beacon, if you are ready."

3216
02:15:34.591 --> 02:15:36.133
LAURA: Are we going to go see it and we're going to go

3217
02:15:36.133 --> 02:15:37.911
see Trent Ikithon?

3218
02:15:37.911 --> 02:15:39.140
MATT: "Well, he's the one who's currently

3219
02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:40.825
"preparing it for transport.

3220
02:15:40.825 --> 02:15:42.765
"I imagine so. If that is challenging,

02:15:42.765 --> 02:15:46.557
"you may stay behind if you wish, Mr. Widogast."

3222
02:15:48.921 --> 02:15:50.645
LIAM: DM.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3223
02:15:50.645 --> 02:15:53.002
LIAM: I was thinking about a family matter.

3224
02:15:53.002 --> 02:15:54.480
Can you repeat what you just said?

3225
02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:55.843
(laughter)

3226
02:15:55.843 --> 02:15:56.676
MATT: Noted.

3227
02:15:58.131 --> 02:16:01.937
He's basically saying, if you aren't currently tied up

3228
02:16:01.937 --> 02:16:04.594
at the moment, we'll go and see the beacon now.

3229
02:16:04.594 --> 02:16:05.981
She inquired if Trent will be there,

3230
02:16:05.981 --> 02:16:07.551
and he said most likely, as he's preparing the beacon.

3231
02:16:07.551 --> 02:16:08.936
LIAM: That is important information.
LAURA: Yeah.

3232
02:16:08.936 --> 02:16:10.702
MATT: But then asked you if you're comfortable or not,

3233
02:16:10.702 --> 02:16:12.508
and if not, you may stay behind.

3234
02:16:12.508 --> 02:16:13.490
LIAM: Okay.

3235
02:16:13.490 --> 02:16:14.964
No.

3236
02:16:14.964 --> 02:16:17.164
LAURA: You'll come?
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

3237
02:16:18.156 --> 02:16:19.627
MATT: "All right.

3238
02:16:19.627 --> 02:16:20.460
"Well then."

3239
02:16:22.297 --> 02:16:27.297
He stands up, sets his tea down, which is finished.

3240
02:16:27.862 --> 02:16:30.987
LAURA: We just follow you, then? Do we just follow you?

3241
02:16:30.987 --> 02:16:32.531
MATT: "Well, I'll take you in there,

3242
02:16:32.531 --> 02:16:34.562
"I just need to inform him of our arrival.

3243
02:16:34.562 --> 02:16:37.843
"It's polite to let them know when you're coming first."

3244
02:16:37.843 --> 02:16:39.649
LAURA: Oh.

3245
02:16:39.649 --> 02:16:42.034
We need to be better about that.
SAM: It is.

3246
02:16:42.034 --> 02:16:43.997
TALIESIN: Boy, if we've learned anything, actually.

3247
02:16:43.997 --> 02:16:46.378
MATT: Makes a familiar hand gesture,

3248
02:16:46.378 --> 02:16:51.022
but that's more subtle and more, it's like a quickened

3249
02:16:51.022 --> 02:16:52.894
version of the Sending spell.

3250
02:16:52.894 --> 02:16:54.477
It's second nature.

3251
02:16:55.493 --> 02:16:59.225
To which he speaks, "'Arriving to inspect the relic

3252
02:16:59.225 --> 02:17:03.862
"'and confirm for our negotiating team

3253
02:17:03.862 --> 02:17:06.695
"'that it is indeed ready

3254
02:17:06.695 --> 02:17:09.586
"'to be presented to the Dynasty.'

3255
02:17:11.921 --> 02:17:13.165
"Shall we?

3256
02:17:13.165 --> 02:17:13.998
SAM: Yes.

3257
02:17:13.998 --> 02:17:16.351
TRAVIS: Lead on.
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3258
02:17:16.351 --> 02:17:19.154
MATT: Begins to take his hands and encircle them,

3259
02:17:19.154 --> 02:17:23.052
leaving this faint trail of light blue-white.

3260
02:17:23.052 --> 02:17:25.065
As it begins to encircle it and draw lines,

3261
02:17:25.065 --> 02:17:28.041
and the center points begins to slowly expand,

3262
02:17:28.041 --> 02:17:31.741
almost like a rippling ring of water,

3263
02:17:31.741 --> 02:17:36.665
until it encompasses your entire circled group of chairs.

3264
02:17:36.665 --> 02:17:39.090
LAURA: Are you going to transport the chairs, too?

3265
02:17:39.090 --> 02:17:40.614
MATT: "No, you might wish to stand."

3266
02:17:40.614 --> 02:17:41.737
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll stand.

3267
02:17:41.737 --> 02:17:45.567
MATT: And he continues and finishes the incantation.

3268
02:17:45.567 --> 02:17:47.296
LAURA: I grab my tail to make sure it's in the circle.

3269
02:17:47.296 --> 02:17:50.327
MATT: All right, and that familiar rush hits you

3270
02:17:50.327 --> 02:17:55.044
as suddenly you are transported out of the tower,

3271
02:17:55.044 --> 02:17:58.845
pulled away into darkness,

3272
02:17:58.845 --> 02:18:00.936
into light that stretches and smears,

3273
02:18:00.936 --> 02:18:02.469
and then thrusts you back into reality.

3274
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:05.243
You all come to your feet.

3275
02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:09.209
It is midday, though it is still shaded.

3276
02:18:09.209 --> 02:18:11.817
You find yourself under a bunch of trees

3277
02:18:11.817 --> 02:18:15.202
in a small clearing, a dense forest.

3278
02:18:15.202 --> 02:18:16.682
You look before you and you can see

3279
02:18:16.682 --> 02:18:19.231
a mountain range that climbs up in the sky.

3280
02:18:19.231 --> 02:18:23.231
It's still clouded, overcast day,

3281
02:18:23.231 --> 02:18:26.524
trees climb up the side of the mountains.

3282
02:18:26.524 --> 02:18:28.255
Before you, you see

3283
02:18:28.255 --> 02:18:32.238
a unique-looking number of buildings.

3284
02:18:33.088 --> 02:18:38.088
There are these tall, pieces of gothic architecture.

3285
02:18:38.294 --> 02:18:40.123
Some three or four stories, some towers,

3286
02:18:40.123 --> 02:18:41.946
a very tall wrought iron fence

3287
02:18:41.946 --> 02:18:44.173
that surrounds the entire locale,

3288
02:18:44.173 --> 02:18:46.919
and there are guards posted.

3289
02:18:46.919 --> 02:18:48.793
You recognize this place.

3290
02:18:48.793 --> 02:18:53.527
He goes, "Welcome to the Vergessen Sanatorium.

3291
02:18:53.527 --> 02:18:54.362
"Follow me, please."

3292
02:18:54.362 --> 02:18:56.363
MARISHA: Oh fuck.

3293
02:18:56.363 --> 02:18:58.369
TRAVIS: (surprised laughter)

3294
02:18:58.369 --> 02:19:00.329
Holy shit!

3295
02:19:00.329 --> 02:19:01.343
MATT: And that's where we're going to take a break.

3296
02:19:01.343 --> 02:19:05.052
(groaning and shouting)
(Matt laughing)

3297
02:19:05.052 --> 02:19:08.261
TRAVIS: Oh, that's where they sent him when he was crazy!

3298
02:19:08.261 --> 02:19:10.594
LAURA: Oh.

3299
02:19:11.978 --> 02:19:14.711
TRAVIS: Oh no!

3300
02:19:14.711 --> 02:19:16.753
This is better than Halloween!

3301
02:19:16.753 --> 02:19:18.899
MATT: (laughs)

3302
02:19:18.899 --> 02:19:20.705
We have our Wyrmwood giveaway.

3303
02:19:20.705 --> 02:19:21.793
We're giving away here, we have our

3304
02:19:21.793 --> 02:19:26.458
black poisonwood dice vault, which is all sorts of pretty,

3305
02:19:26.458 --> 02:19:29.958
for one lucky winner in the chat.

3306
02:19:29.958 --> 02:19:33.755
Tonight's codename is diplomacy.

3307
02:19:33.755 --> 02:19:35.142
TALIESIN: Hey.

3308
02:19:35.142 --> 02:19:36.604
LIAM: Pow, pow, pow.
TALIESIN: That's a throwback.

3309
02:19:36.604 --> 02:19:37.672
MATT: Indeed.

3310
02:19:37.672 --> 02:19:40.275
So go ahead and put the word diplomacy once

3311
02:19:40.275 --> 02:19:41.994
into the chat room to enter.

3312
02:19:41.994 --> 02:19:43.105
More than once, you'll be disqualified,

3313
02:19:43.105 --> 02:19:44.753
and once again, only for people in the U.S. and Canada,

3314
02:19:44.753 --> 02:19:46.562
excluding Quebec, because stupid laws.

3315
02:19:46.562 --> 02:19:49.001
But we'll return here shortly to continue the story.

3316
02:19:49.001 --> 02:19:50.651
See you in a minute.

3317
02:19:52.253 --> 02:19:53.433

JOE (V.O.): Working with Idle Champions
has been so much fun,

3336
02:20:42.885 --> 02:20:46.502
because it's a different version of Arkhan.

3337
02:20:46.502 --> 02:20:50.371
It's like a cartoon coloring book version of Arkhan,

3338
02:20:50.371 --> 02:20:52.449
which is really, really fun.

3339
02:20:52.449 --> 02:20:56.451
So seeing the artwork originally for little Arkhan

3340
02:20:56.451 --> 02:20:58.632
in the game, the way that he walks across the screen

3341
02:20:58.632 --> 02:21:01.258
with his shield and he breathes fire,

3342
02:21:01.258 --> 02:21:04.407
and then even the way that Chungo the manticore comes down

3343
02:21:04.407 --> 02:21:05.841
at different points.

3344
02:21:05.841 --> 02:21:08.649
(sword clashes and explosions)

3345
02:21:08.649 --> 02:21:09.970
It's so much fun.

3346
02:21:09.970 --> 02:21:12.913
I mean, you can only dream to have a character of yours

3347
02:21:12.913 --> 02:21:16.636
that immortalized in that way, and playable and unlockable

3348
02:21:16.636 --> 02:21:17.608
in a video game.

3349
02:21:17.608 --> 02:21:20.346
The Arkhan in Idle Champions currently

3350
02:21:20.346 --> 02:21:22.969
is an earlier version of Arkhan.

3351
02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:25.805
So a pre-Hand of Vecna Arkhan.

3352
02:21:25.805 --> 02:21:27.693
How did Arkhan get the Hand of Vecna?

3353
02:21:27.693 --> 02:21:32.057
Arkhan was sent out by Tiamat over the course of, you know,

3354
02:21:32.057 --> 02:21:36.295
a decade to go and retrieve artifacts for her.

3355
02:21:36.295 --> 02:21:39.594
So a Tiamat would appear to Arkhan in dreams,

3356
02:21:39.594 --> 02:21:42.683
and she would reveal to him the location of a great weapon

3357
02:21:42.683 --> 02:21:45.064
that could help him, or a great suit of armor,

3358
02:21:45.064 --> 02:21:47.423
like the axe that he carries, belonged to a general

3359
02:21:47.423 --> 02:21:50.142
of Asmodeus and was buried inside of his tomb,

3360
02:21:50.142 --> 02:21:52.677
so Arkhan went on this adventure to find

3361
02:21:52.677 --> 02:21:56.329
that axe of Asmodeus.

3362
02:21:56.329 --> 02:21:58.545
And so Tiamat would appear to him in dreams,

3363
02:21:58.545 --> 02:22:02.790
and she did the same to him in terms of this

3364
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:07.726
extinction event that was potentially about to happen,

3365
02:22:07.726 --> 02:22:12.392
where Vecna had teleported huge pieces of land

3366
02:22:12.392 --> 02:22:15.003
from the Shadowfell, and armies, and animated

3367
02:22:15.003 --> 02:22:18.470
this giant long-dead Titan and was inside of this

3368
02:22:18.470 --> 02:22:22.491
mile-high structure, juggernaut,

3369
02:22:22.491 --> 02:22:26.062
going to destroy everything its path.

3370
02:22:26.062 --> 02:22:29.089
And so Arkhan was sent there in order to

3371
02:22:29.089 --> 02:22:33.500
stop Vecna from destroying the realm.

3372
02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:38.278
Arkhan's entire party was killed, except for him,

3373
02:22:38.278 --> 02:22:42.832
and he wound up using his charisma

3374
02:22:42.832 --> 02:22:46.022
to become assimilated into another group

3375
02:22:46.022 --> 02:22:49.368
that shared the same primary objective,

3376
02:22:49.368 --> 02:22:52.186
which was to kill Vecna, and destroy Vecna

3377
02:22:52.186 --> 02:22:55.206
and stop Vecna from taking over the Prime Material Plane.

3378
02:22:55.206 --> 02:22:57.669
Now, what this party didn't know

3379
02:22:57.669 --> 02:23:00.370
was that Arkhan had a secondary objective,

3380
02:23:00.370 --> 02:23:04.374
which was to find out what was allowing Vecna

3381
02:23:04.374 --> 02:23:08.774
to teleport cities and armies from other planes,

3382
02:23:09.934 --> 02:23:12.236
and bring that back.

3383
02:23:12.236 --> 02:23:15.896
So during that battle, Arkhan survived,

3384
02:23:15.896 --> 02:23:17.708
and towards the end realized that the power

3385
02:23:17.708 --> 02:23:20.425
was coming from Vecna's hand.

3386
02:23:21.801 --> 02:23:26.342
So when the battle was won, one of the...

3387
02:23:27.776 --> 02:23:28.901
members of this party

3388
02:23:28.901 --> 02:23:33.130
that Arkhan joined was going to die.

3389
02:23:33.130 --> 02:23:36.297
And so in this very vulnerable moment,

3390
02:23:37.307 --> 02:23:40.956
this, you know, the friends were gathered around

3391
02:23:40.956 --> 02:23:43.572
as he was about to pass,

3392
02:23:43.572 --> 02:23:46.605
and Arkhan pulled off this move.

3393
02:23:46.605 --> 02:23:49.181
In this very vulnerable moment, he used their vulnerability

3394
02:23:49.181 --> 02:23:52.849
against them, and in a quiet moment,

3395
02:23:52.849 --> 02:23:56.716
led them to believe that he was sent to destroy the hand.

3396
02:23:56.716 --> 02:23:59.366
And he had the power to do so in this axe.

3397
02:23:59.366 --> 02:24:01.124
And when he raised his hand up and whispered

3398
02:24:01.124 --> 02:24:04.479
a prayer to Tiamat, and everyone looked on,

3399
02:24:04.479 --> 02:24:07.031
he swung the axe down, chopped his own arm off,

3400
02:24:07.031 --> 02:24:11.597
replaced it with Vecna's hand, and teleported away.

3401
02:24:11.597 --> 02:24:15.547
He teleported to Krull, who was waiting for him,

3402
02:24:15.547 --> 02:24:17.911
who healed him from the battle

3403
02:24:17.911 --> 02:24:22.760
and opened a door to Avernus, to where Arkhan went

3404
02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:24.827
and then had an audience with Tiamat.

3405
02:24:24.827 --> 02:24:28.884
Tiamat rose this giant tower of obsidian

3406
02:24:28.884 --> 02:24:32.288
and volcanic rock out of hell,

3407
02:24:32.288 --> 02:24:35.971
and this nine layers tower

3408
02:24:35.971 --> 02:24:38.379
with dragon heads around the top.

3409
02:24:38.379 --> 02:24:41.788
Arkhan and Krull then sent for Toragar,

3410
02:24:41.788 --> 02:24:45.068
and he met them there, and this army formed,

3411
02:24:45.068 --> 02:24:47.905
this dragon army formed around Arkhan,

3412
02:24:47.905 --> 02:24:49.862
who was this champion who had returned

3413
02:24:49.862 --> 02:24:52.870
with what the dragon called, and the dragon armies believed

3414
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:56.836
was the actual cure for

3415
02:24:57.694 --> 02:24:58.977
Tiamat's imprisonment,

3416
02:24:58.977 --> 02:25:00.838
that finally someone was going to come along

3417
02:25:00.838 --> 02:25:02.591
with the power to free her.

3418
02:25:02.591 --> 02:25:05.437
But Arkhan needed time to figure out

3419
02:25:05.437 --> 02:25:09.397
how to use the hand, and how to unlock its power.

3420
02:25:09.397 --> 02:25:13.391
And so he began this series of mental battles with Vecna,

3421
02:25:13.391 --> 02:25:17.369
where they would meet on this ethereal plane,

3422
02:25:17.369 --> 02:25:20.439
and have these mental face-offs, and these mental battles,

3423
02:25:20.439 --> 02:25:24.067
in which Arkhan would try to understand Vecna's secrets

3424
02:25:24.067 --> 02:25:26.679
while Vecna would try to gain control over Arkhan's mind.

3425
02:25:26.679 --> 02:25:28.905
That's how our Arkhan got the hand,

3426
02:25:28.905 --> 02:25:30.893
and that's what he's doing with it now,

3427
02:25:30.893 --> 02:25:33.756
and that's what he's up to when you as a player character

3428
02:25:33.756 --> 02:25:37.104
run into him, he is in the middle of this process

3429
02:25:37.104 --> 02:25:38.512
trying to free Tiamat.

3430
02:25:38.512 --> 02:25:43.445
(dramatic music)

3431
02:25:48.379 --> 02:25:50.707
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

3432
02:25:50.707 --> 02:25:52.535
MARISHA: (high-pitched) The socials.

3433
02:25:53.569 --> 02:25:54.854
BRIAN: That's kind of your cuttlefish,

3434
02:25:54.854 --> 02:25:55.982
except it's not as good.

3435
02:25:55.982 --> 02:25:57.999
MARISHA: No. I can't do that voice.

3436
02:25:57.999 --> 02:25:58.967
I can't do it.

3437
02:25:58.967 --> 02:26:01.946
BRIAN: The speak 'n spell, that man has a lot of talent.

3438
02:26:01.946 --> 02:26:02.779
TALIESIN: Nope.

3439
02:26:02.779 --> 02:26:03.910
BRIAN: Man has a lot of talent.

3440
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:05.868
Yeah, that's pretty good, Dani.

3441
02:26:05.868 --> 02:26:07.448
TALIESIN: Pretty good.
DANI: That was good.

3442
02:26:07.448 --> 02:26:08.889
BRIAN: Well, it's not <i>as</i> good, of course.

3443
02:26:08.889 --> 02:26:10.023
MARISHA: It's like the Stitch voice.

3444
02:26:10.023 --> 02:26:14.038
It's like Macaroni Samsonite, it's all in that same like...

3445
02:26:14.038 --> 02:26:18.951
(babbling)

3446
02:26:18.951 --> 02:26:20.646
And I can't do it.

3447
02:26:20.646 --> 02:26:22.144
I can't do it.

3448
02:26:22.144 --> 02:26:23.099
BRIAN: Would you mind doing that again,

3449
02:26:23.099 --> 02:26:24.358
but looking at that camera right there?

3450
02:26:24.358 --> 02:26:25.835
MARISHA: Thanks.

3451
02:26:25.835 --> 02:26:27.616
Thanks, Zach, for cutting to my single.

3452
02:26:27.616 --> 02:26:30.260
DANI: I'm trying to save you from yourself, man.

3453
02:26:31.935 --> 02:26:33.467
TALIESIN: That's just going to become an internet thing.

3454
02:26:33.467 --> 02:26:34.685
Why would you do that to yourself?

3455
02:26:34.685 --> 02:26:36.939
MARISHA: Beau's not stupid.
BRIAN: Mm-hmm.

3456
02:26:36.939 --> 02:26:40.059
MARISHA: Beau will only challenge authority

3457
02:26:40.059 --> 02:26:42.175
when she feels like it is

3458
02:26:45.234 --> 02:26:48.717
yeah, a challenge that she can make with

3459
02:26:48.717 --> 02:26:50.600
limited repercussions,

3460
02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.700
hopefully, one that she can successfully win,

3461
02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:57.024
or at least get out of if challenged.

3462
02:26:58.649 --> 02:27:02.106
There's like, oh, I'm going to
fuck with authority figures.

3463
02:27:02.106 --> 02:27:05.382
And then there's like, talking to the King

3464
02:27:05.382 --> 02:27:09.472
of the nation that you probably
don't want to fuck with,

3465
02:27:09.472 --> 02:27:12.027
or else be locked in an Empire prison

3466
02:27:12.027 --> 02:27:14.311
for the rest of your life and never seen again.

3467
02:27:14.311 --> 02:27:16.961
BRIAN: Beau's been more actively
leaning into her role

3468
02:27:16.961 --> 02:27:19.820
in the Cobalt Soul, now that
she's become an expositor.

3469
02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:22.268
Does she feel more connected to the organization

3470
02:27:22.268 --> 02:27:24.230
as a whole now, in addition to individuals

3471
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:27.079
like Dairon and Zeenoth?

3472
02:27:27.079 --> 02:27:28.912
MARISHA: For sure. I mean...

3473
02:27:30.104 --> 02:27:33.814
it's like anybody when they get a promotion

3474
02:27:33.814 --> 02:27:36.125
in their workplace.

3475
02:27:36.125 --> 02:27:38.512
You feel a little bit more ownership,

3476
02:27:38.512 --> 02:27:43.214
and now you're, like, more peer level

3477
02:27:43.214 --> 02:27:46.978
with the people who were your authority figures.

3478
02:27:46.978 --> 02:27:48.927
So, there you go.

3479
02:27:48.927 --> 02:27:51.514
There's your authority figure question.

3480
02:27:51.514 --> 02:27:54.172
TALIESIN: Nothing worse punk that becomes a cop, man.

3481
02:27:54.172 --> 02:27:56.702
MARISHA: (laughs)

3482
02:27:56.702 --> 02:27:58.747
TALIESIN: Changed, changed.
MARISHA: It's true.

3483
02:27:58.747 --> 02:28:00.566
BRIAN: Boy, that's true.

3484
02:28:00.566 --> 02:28:02.866
MARISHA: That's true, isn't it, Hanukah moose?

3485
02:28:02.866 --> 02:28:04.796
Yeah.
BRIAN: Boy, that's true.

3486
02:28:04.796 --> 02:28:07.584
Would you mind putting that just right next to your face

3487
02:28:07.584 --> 02:28:08.850
and looking at Greg here for a second?

3488
02:28:08.850 --> 02:28:10.683
Zach, you got it handy?

3489
02:28:12.058 --> 02:28:13.204
Let's see what we--

3490
02:28:13.204 --> 02:28:15.078
MARISHA: (laughs)
BRIAN: Yeah, let's see what we can come up with.

3491
02:28:15.078 --> 02:28:16.678
TALIESIN: I know what's coming.
BRIAN: You know what's coming?

3492
02:28:16.678 --> 02:28:18.181
TALIESIN: I have a hint.
BRIAN: No, you don't.

3493
02:28:18.181 --> 02:28:20.400
MARISHA: Yep, yep.

3494
02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:22.072
TALIESIN: (Caduceus voice) Yeah, I mean.
DANI: Oh god.

3495
02:28:22.072 --> 02:28:25.086
BRIAN: Now, when I think about the greatest episodes

3496
02:28:25.086 --> 02:28:26.503
of Talks Machina.

3497
02:28:27.865 --> 02:28:30.146
TALIESIN: (Caduceus voice) What are you going
to think about, really?

3498
02:28:30.146 --> 02:28:31.983
BRIAN: Caduceus admitted to The Gentleman

3499
02:28:31.983 --> 02:28:33.968
that there is a part of him that is lonely.

3500
02:28:33.968 --> 02:28:35.999
How much of that was truth and how much was

3501
02:28:35.999 --> 02:28:38.752
an attempt to persuade him to tell Jester the truth?

3502
02:28:38.752 --> 02:28:40.291
TALIESIN: Oh, of course it was the truth.

3503
02:28:40.291 --> 02:28:43.883
That's Caduceus's whole--

3504
02:28:43.883 --> 02:28:47.371
whole trick, is just tell the truth.

3505
02:28:47.371 --> 02:28:49.327
Yeah, he misses his family.

3506
02:28:49.327 --> 02:28:52.774
And like, they left him in kind of a shitty way,

3507
02:28:52.774 --> 02:28:54.999
when you think about it, just like,

3508
02:28:54.999 --> 02:28:57.459
he just sat in the same place while people left,

3509
02:28:57.459 --> 02:29:00.324
and then six months later,
someone else left,

3510
02:29:00.324 --> 02:29:02.077
and then six months later, someone,

3511
02:29:02.077 --> 02:29:04.488
people just kept not coming back, until he was

3512
02:29:04.488 --> 02:29:08.221
sitting alone in a forest
by himself for quite awhile.

3513
02:29:08.221 --> 02:29:11.758
MARISHA: Why haven't you ever
tried to scry on any of them?

3514
02:29:11.758 --> 02:29:15.544
TALIESIN: (sputtering exhale)

3515
02:29:15.544 --> 02:29:16.906
That's a question, isn't it?

3516
02:29:16.906 --> 02:29:18.140
DANI: (laughs)

3517
02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:19.055
BRIAN: Boy, that got a reaction.

3518
02:29:19.055 --> 02:29:19.998
TALIESIN: Wow.
MARISHA: You've never asked.

3519
02:29:19.998 --> 02:29:21.664
BRIAN: That got a bit of a reaction, didn't it?

3520
02:29:21.664 --> 02:29:22.597
MARISHA: You've never been like,

3521
02:29:22.597 --> 02:29:23.945
can I scry on my brothers?

3522
02:29:23.945 --> 02:29:28.516
TALIESIN: Do you want the simple answer to that
or the complex answer to that?

3523
02:29:28.516 --> 02:29:30.710
BRIAN: I don't want an answer to that, actually.

3524
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:31.546
DANI: I mean, I do.

3525
02:29:31.546 --> 02:29:33.987
BRIAN: No, I don't, because I want to save it,

3526
02:29:33.987 --> 02:29:37.355
I feel like that might-- I feel like
that could come out in-game.

3527
02:29:37.355 --> 02:29:38.188
TALIESIN: It could come out in-game.

3528
02:29:38.188 --> 02:29:41.179
BRIAN: So I'm like, I'm on team save it,

3529
02:29:41.179 --> 02:29:42.667
I'm not into instant gratification.

3530
02:29:42.667 --> 02:29:46.020
TALIESIN: There's the answer he would give
and then there's the truth. (laughing)

3531
02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:48.956
MARISHA: You just said Caduceus was all about the truth.

3532
02:29:48.956 --> 02:29:50.825
TALIESIN: Yes, but you found a hole in that.

3533
02:29:50.825 --> 02:29:51.941
MARISHA and DANI: (gasping)

3534
02:29:51.941 --> 02:29:54.273
TALIESIN: You found a hole.
BRIAN: Oh, that took forever.

3535
02:29:54.273 --> 02:29:55.169
Boy.

3536
02:29:55.169 --> 02:29:58.828
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a deep, dark place.

3537
02:29:58.828 --> 02:30:01.154
MARISHA: Fucking expositor!

3538
02:30:01.154 --> 02:30:02.139
Yeah!
DANI: (laughs)

3539
02:30:02.139 --> 02:30:04.278
TALIESIN: All they can see is your sweater.

3540
02:30:04.278 --> 02:30:05.851
Ah, god, did you just moose me?

3541
02:30:05.851 --> 02:30:07.098
MARISHA: Yeah, just moose dropped you, bitch.

3542
02:30:07.098 --> 02:30:07.931
TALIESIN: Fuck, dude!

3543
02:30:07.931 --> 02:30:10.503
BRIAN: You got moose dropped, biatch.
TALIESIN: Right in the nose.

3544
02:30:10.503 --> 02:30:11.556
MARISHA: Sorry.

3545
02:30:13.123 --> 02:30:16.295
(Pumat grunting)

3546
02:30:16.295 --> 02:30:18.423
MATT: Oh. Well! (chuckling)

3547
02:30:18.423 --> 02:30:19.790
Would you look at that?

3548
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:21.157
I think it worked.

3549
02:30:21.157 --> 02:30:23.222
You were right, Pumat number three.

3550
02:30:23.222 --> 02:30:27.066
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.

3551
02:30:27.066 --> 02:30:29.157
Pumat number three?

3552
02:30:31.337 --> 02:30:32.615
Oh boy.

3553
02:30:32.615 --> 02:30:34.055
Well, hello there.

3554
02:30:34.055 --> 02:30:35.518
I'm Pumat Prime.

3555
02:30:35.518 --> 02:30:39.044
It's good to finally join you
here in the prime dimension.

3556
02:30:39.044 --> 02:30:43.643
I see this is the Twitch Prime realm, I think,

3557
02:30:43.643 --> 02:30:47.815
and oh, we're on the Critical Role
channel, aren't we?

3558
02:30:47.815 --> 02:30:50.907
Well, would you look at that,
you got chat and everything.

3559
02:30:50.907 --> 02:30:51.765
(chuckles)

3560
02:30:51.765 --> 02:30:55.371
Respectfully, I was looking
for the prime rib realm,

3561
02:30:55.371 --> 02:30:58.011
but this isn't too bad.

3562
02:30:58.011 --> 02:31:00.196
You see, if you already have access

3563
02:31:00.196 --> 02:31:03.339
to the Amazon Prime realm,
you can get a free subscription

3564
02:31:03.339 --> 02:31:06.494
to the channel of your choice
in the Twitch Prime realm.

3565
02:31:06.494 --> 02:31:08.980
The two realms have a
pretty good working relationship

3566
02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:11.231
after that peace treaty the prime minister

3567
02:31:11.231 --> 02:31:13.226
signed a few years back.

3568
02:31:13.226 --> 02:31:15.084
You just have to remember to renew

3569
02:31:15.084 --> 02:31:17.953
your Twitch Prime subscription
at the top of each month,

3570
02:31:17.953 --> 02:31:18.904
respectfully.

3571
02:31:18.904 --> 02:31:21.929
And hey, if you're already a subscriber,

3572
02:31:21.929 --> 02:31:24.284
you can spread the joy
by gifting a subscription

3573
02:31:24.284 --> 02:31:27.155
using the Gift a Sub button.

3574
02:31:27.155 --> 02:31:30.184
That is, assuming the Empire
hasn't sent a tax man

3575
02:31:30.184 --> 02:31:34.396
to your shop here recently. (chuckling)

3576
02:31:34.396 --> 02:31:36.573
All right, well, off to find that darn elusive

3577
02:31:36.573 --> 02:31:38.051
prime rib realm.

3578
02:31:38.051 --> 02:31:41.732
Who knew the prime dimension
had so many pockets?

3579
02:31:41.732 --> 02:31:44.124
Good luck. (chuckles)

3580
02:31:45.231 --> 02:31:46.873
(echoing) Pumat three?

3581
02:31:49.709 --> 02:31:51.626
TALIESIN (V.O.): Subscribe.

3582
02:31:53.348 --> 02:31:55.498
Re-subscribe.

3583
02:31:56.687 --> 02:31:59.579
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

3584
02:32:03.827 --> 02:32:08.627
(dramatic music)

3585
02:44:52.332 --> 02:44:53.587
MATT: Welcome back.

3586
02:44:53.587 --> 02:44:54.589
So, before we get back into the game,

3587
02:44:54.589 --> 02:44:55.863
we do have our winner for this evening.

3588
02:44:55.863 --> 02:45:00.081
The winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway is Forsakenpoet541.

3589
02:45:00.081 --> 02:45:01.300
LIAM: Oh no!

3590
02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:03.235
MATT: Forsakenpoet541, congratulations,

3591
02:45:03.235 --> 02:45:05.017
we'll get that sent to you ASAP.

3592
02:45:05.017 --> 02:45:06.250
TRAVIS: Yay.
LIAM: Somebody help that poet.

3593
02:45:06.250 --> 02:45:08.916
MATT: I know. We're going to help them
with a dice box.

3594
02:45:08.916 --> 02:45:10.589
Little dice carrying case.

3595
02:45:10.589 --> 02:45:14.014
All righty, so, last we left off,

3596
02:45:15.483 --> 02:45:18.632
as the troop of you begin to walk towards

3597
02:45:18.632 --> 02:45:22.488
the somewhat serene, but still imposing sight

3598
02:45:22.488 --> 02:45:24.504
of the Vergessen Sanatorium,

3599
02:45:25.463 --> 02:45:28.196
you approach behind

3600
02:45:28.196 --> 02:45:31.496
Martinet Ludinus towards the main gate,

3601
02:45:31.496 --> 02:45:35.447
which in itself is about a 10-foot high,

3602
02:45:35.447 --> 02:45:39.239
about eight-foot wide iron gate

3603
02:45:39.239 --> 02:45:40.563
that rises up

3604
02:45:40.563 --> 02:45:42.232
in a curve at the top where it breaks open.

3605
02:45:42.232 --> 02:45:44.729
There are two guards placed there,

3606
02:45:44.729 --> 02:45:48.078
both wearing Crownsguard uniforms,

3607
02:45:48.078 --> 02:45:50.902
though darker, meant for more,

3608
02:45:50.902 --> 02:45:53.373
guess you would say, not stealth,

3609
02:45:53.373 --> 02:45:56.017
but to blend in better with
the forest arrangement

3610
02:45:56.017 --> 02:45:59.598
around here, carrying spears,
and as they see Ludinus,

3611
02:45:59.598 --> 02:46:02.630
they nod, and one of them opens the gate,

3612
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:05.956
which (imitates creaking),
opens into the courtyard.

3613
02:46:05.956 --> 02:46:10.059
And the courtyard around here, beautiful grass.

3614
02:46:10.059 --> 02:46:13.283
You can see there are two fountains

3615
02:46:13.283 --> 02:46:18.046
that are readily visible,
there are trees, small gardens,

3616
02:46:18.046 --> 02:46:20.990
and there are, total within the space here,

3617
02:46:20.990 --> 02:46:23.931
five main structures that you can see,

3618
02:46:23.931 --> 02:46:25.626
two of which are connected by hallways,

3619
02:46:25.626 --> 02:46:28.206
the others are separate with
little stone paths

3620
02:46:28.206 --> 02:46:30.002
that lead between them.

3621
02:46:30.002 --> 02:46:31.539
They're large buildings.

3622
02:46:31.539 --> 02:46:33.038
The towers themselves stand up

3623
02:46:33.038 --> 02:46:35.496
at the corners of the entire interior

3624
02:46:35.496 --> 02:46:37.090
while this main central building itself

3625
02:46:37.090 --> 02:46:40.316
is a very, very, like wide, three-story

3626
02:46:40.316 --> 02:46:45.213
mansion-like structure that the roof comes into

3627
02:46:45.213 --> 02:46:47.372
these large peaks that have, you know,

3628
02:46:47.372 --> 02:46:49.030
iron symbols that are carved

3629
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:51.006
at the top that rise up.

3630
02:46:51.006 --> 02:46:55.601
It has in some ways like a European church

3631
02:46:55.601 --> 02:46:58.329
type architecture to it,
but does not have any sort

3632
02:46:58.329 --> 02:47:00.483
of religious symbolism or connotation to it.

3633
02:47:00.483 --> 02:47:02.900
It's very beautiful, if dark.

3634
02:47:04.725 --> 02:47:08.571
You approach and come towards
the center of the courtyard,

3635
02:47:08.571 --> 02:47:10.830
two of the other guards approach and

3636
02:47:10.830 --> 02:47:14.211
flank to the sides to just be an escort,

3637
02:47:14.211 --> 02:47:19.190
and wordlessly, the Martinet leads you towards

3638
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:22.374
the distant right tower.

3639
02:47:25.211 --> 02:47:26.055
You may--

3640
02:47:26.055 --> 02:47:29.407
LAURA: Mr. Martinet, you're not
just going to like,

3641
02:47:29.407 --> 02:47:32.226
bring us here and then leave us here, right?

3642
02:47:32.226 --> 02:47:35.483
MATT: "I don't think it would
do any good, in our situation.

3643
02:47:35.483 --> 02:47:37.758
"The sanatorium has many uses.

3644
02:47:37.758 --> 02:47:40.341
"It is a place of recovery,

3645
02:47:40.341 --> 02:47:43.999
"it is a place of care taking

3646
02:47:43.999 --> 02:47:46.864
"to individuals who cannot
take care of themselves,

3647
02:47:46.864 --> 02:47:49.374
"particularly those of
skillsets that make them

3648
02:47:49.374 --> 02:47:53.782
"challenging to treat,

3649
02:47:53.782 --> 02:47:55.426
"in more public regions.

3650
02:47:55.426 --> 02:47:59.603
"It's also a place of learning
for those with learning challenges.

3651
02:47:59.603 --> 02:48:03.418
"And it is a place where we, the Assembly,

3652
02:48:03.418 --> 02:48:05.976
"can maintain...

3653
02:48:08.976 --> 02:48:11.427
"some of our research,

3654
02:48:11.427 --> 02:48:16.268
"without worrying about,
how you say,

3655
02:48:16.268 --> 02:48:17.968
"political challenges."

3656
02:48:19.255 --> 02:48:22.192
ASHLEY: Can people come and go as they wish,

3657
02:48:22.192 --> 02:48:25.525
or are some people here, can they leave?

3658
02:48:27.025 --> 02:48:31.283
MATT: "Those that are not admitted can leave.

3659
02:48:31.283 --> 02:48:36.071
"Those that are here by choice
for the period

3660
02:48:36.071 --> 02:48:39.333
"in which they signed themselves to be here

3661
02:48:39.333 --> 02:48:43.612
"are to be maintained,
but they themselves give consent

3662
02:48:43.612 --> 02:48:47.823
"to the sanatorium to keep them,
and those that are kept

3663
02:48:47.823 --> 02:48:51.421
"because they are a danger
to themselves or others,

3664
02:48:51.421 --> 02:48:56.329
"they should be kept until they are well.

3665
02:48:58.618 --> 02:49:02.978
LIAM: During this whole walk and talk,
Caleb wordlessly stares,

3666
02:49:02.978 --> 02:49:06.668
very pointedly, at Nott and at Beau,

3667
02:49:06.668 --> 02:49:09.073
listening to this conversation ahead of him.

3668
02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:12.755
TRAVIS: Lead on.

3669
02:49:12.755 --> 02:49:14.661
MATT: "Indeed."

3670
02:49:14.661 --> 02:49:17.570
The far tower is-- it's a wide tower,

3671
02:49:17.570 --> 02:49:20.437
and it looks to be about, at its full height,

3672
02:49:20.437 --> 02:49:24.638
about 80 or so feet from the ground.

3673
02:49:24.638 --> 02:49:27.760
It pincers towards the top of the--

3674
02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:29.159
it's thicker at the base.

3675
02:49:29.159 --> 02:49:30.962
Not crenelated on the edges.

3676
02:49:30.962 --> 02:49:32.526
As opposed to just a thick stronghold,

3677
02:49:32.526 --> 02:49:34.692
this has a little more design flair to it.

3678
02:49:34.692 --> 02:49:36.584
It mimics a lot of the architecture

3679
02:49:36.584 --> 02:49:38.700
of the central mansion building.

3680
02:49:39.692 --> 02:49:44.692
You enter through a side doorway, and into

3681
02:49:44.709 --> 02:49:48.542
one of two chambers that the
bottom floor is separated into.

3682
02:49:48.542 --> 02:49:51.440
This is more of a lounge or a waiting space,

3683
02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:53.456
in which case Ludinus goes,

3684
02:49:53.456 --> 02:49:54.747
"If you would give me

3685
02:49:54.747 --> 02:49:59.350
but a moment, I'm going to inquire as to the readiness

3686
02:49:59.350 --> 02:50:00.908
of our arrival."

3687
02:50:01.867 --> 02:50:04.367
And he exits down the nearby stairway,

3688
02:50:05.234 --> 02:50:06.313
out of sight.

3689
02:50:06.313 --> 02:50:07.799
MARISHA: I'm assuming the escorts stay?

3690
02:50:07.799 --> 02:50:10.073
MATT: The escorts stay.

3691
02:50:10.073 --> 02:50:12.334
SAM: How you feeling, Caleb?

3692
02:50:12.334 --> 02:50:13.167
You okay?

3693
02:50:15.648 --> 02:50:17.589
ASHLEY: Have you been here before?

3694
02:50:20.245 --> 02:50:23.512
LAURA: How long were you here for?

3695
02:50:29.545 --> 02:50:30.812
LIAM: (quietly) 11 years.

3696
02:50:31.966 --> 02:50:33.640
ASHLEY: What did you say?

3697
02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:34.473
LIAM: (clears throat)

3698
02:50:35.783 --> 02:50:36.892
(louder) 11 years.

3699
02:50:39.859 --> 02:50:41.393
ASHLEY: That is what I thought you said.

3700
02:50:41.393 --> 02:50:45.393
SAM: In this area, where we are, or the other side?

3701
02:50:46.458 --> 02:50:48.428
Or you don't know.

3702
02:50:48.428 --> 02:50:51.296
LIAM: This is a public waiting room.

3703
02:50:51.296 --> 02:50:55.051
SAM: I mean this building, this structure?

3704
02:50:55.051 --> 02:50:56.901
MATT: You see two uniformed figures

3705
02:50:56.901 --> 02:50:58.496
enter through one of the doorways.

3706
02:50:58.496 --> 02:51:02.416
They're wearing a light gray general piece

3707
02:51:02.416 --> 02:51:05.508
of work attire, it's form-fitting but comfortable looking,

3708
02:51:05.508 --> 02:51:08.437
plain, and they both just walk past

3709
02:51:08.437 --> 02:51:10.905
and just take notice and continue on their business,

3710
02:51:10.905 --> 02:51:12.655
going up to an upper floor.

3711
02:51:14.968 --> 02:51:16.917
MARISHA: You busted out of this place.

3712
02:51:17.792 --> 02:51:18.625
Yeah?

3713
02:51:21.738 --> 02:51:25.054
SAM: Well, we're here for you, so don't worry.

3714
02:51:27.730 --> 02:51:30.371
LIAM: I don't remember much of it anyway.

3715
02:51:32.129 --> 02:51:33.379
Which is funny.

3716
02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:40.050
MARISHA: Have we been by any other admittants?

3717
02:51:41.394 --> 02:51:43.331
SAM: Oh, like patients?
MARISHA: Patients?

3718
02:51:43.331 --> 02:51:45.205
MATT: Mm-mm.

3719
02:51:45.205 --> 02:51:48.247
TALIESIN: Are we inside or are we outside?
MATT: You are inside the tower.

3720
02:51:48.247 --> 02:51:50.959
TALIESIN: We are inside the tower.
LIAM: It's for visitors, where we are.

3721
02:51:50.959 --> 02:51:52.634
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: We're not in--

3722
02:51:52.634 --> 02:51:54.780
MATT: Or this chamber in particular,
it's a holding room

3723
02:51:54.780 --> 02:51:58.521
for people to then be brought
to other portions of the tower.

3724
02:51:58.521 --> 02:51:59.354
LIAM: Yeah, we're not in it.

3725
02:51:59.354 --> 02:52:01.354
TALIESIN: Try and quietly listen very carefully

3726
02:52:01.354 --> 02:52:03.464
for any conversations happening.

3727
02:52:03.464 --> 02:52:05.974
LIAM: Would I have on the walk-- I'm sorry.

3728
02:52:05.974 --> 02:52:06.807
TALIESIN: Go ahead.

3729
02:52:06.807 --> 02:52:09.857
LIAM: On the walk up, have recognized the layout

3730
02:52:09.857 --> 02:52:14.205
to know where I was kept compared to where we are?

3731
02:52:14.205 --> 02:52:15.148
MATT: Yeah.

3732
02:52:15.148 --> 02:52:16.519
LIAM: Is it this building, or--?

3733
02:52:16.519 --> 02:52:18.687
MATT: No, no, you were kept in the main manor.
LIAM: Main manor.

3734
02:52:18.687 --> 02:52:20.662
MATT: Which is where most of the...

3735
02:52:20.662 --> 02:52:23.984
most of the patients are kept.
LIAM: Yeah.

3736
02:52:23.984 --> 02:52:27.788
MATT: The general towers on the outside are for

3737
02:52:29.047 --> 02:52:30.965
the people that work the sanatorium,

3738
02:52:30.965 --> 02:52:32.702
it's also where equipment is kept,

3739
02:52:32.702 --> 02:52:34.526
it's also where research is conducted,

3740
02:52:34.526 --> 02:52:36.857
and it's also where certain events

3741
02:52:36.857 --> 02:52:39.353
and classes and things are occasionally held there.

3742
02:52:39.353 --> 02:52:41.770
TRAVIS: The outside towers?
MATT: Yeah.

3743
02:52:41.770 --> 02:52:43.711
TRAVIS: There's five, so tower, tower,

3744
02:52:43.711 --> 02:52:45.522
building, building, building?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3745
02:52:45.522 --> 02:52:48.400
MARISHA: And we're just more or less
in like a lobby or hall?

3746
02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:50.380
MATT: Kind of, for the time being.
MARISHA: Okay.

3747
02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:52.284
TALIESIN: Listening closely to the conversations

3748
02:52:52.284 --> 02:52:54.384
that are happening around,
just trying to like listen

3749
02:52:54.384 --> 02:52:55.564
to the building.

3750
02:52:55.564 --> 02:52:57.157
Natural 20 for 29.

3751
02:52:57.157 --> 02:52:58.733
MATT: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

3752
02:52:58.733 --> 02:53:00.052
MATT: Shit.

3753
02:53:00.052 --> 02:53:05.052
You hear the two assigned guards
that are watching you guys

3754
02:53:05.521 --> 02:53:09.886
are having a conversation about how they're both

3755
02:53:09.886 --> 02:53:13.488
frustrated that the Harvest Festival was missed,

3756
02:53:13.488 --> 02:53:17.652
and they were stuck here,
and now that they're

3757
02:53:17.652 --> 02:53:19.948
hearing about like, all this, yeah,

3758
02:53:19.948 --> 02:53:21.541
they're complaining about the fact

3759
02:53:21.541 --> 02:53:23.049
that they've been here for now,

3760
02:53:23.049 --> 02:53:25.886
one of them at least, a four-month stint,

3761
02:53:25.886 --> 02:53:29.262
and is just wanting to
be desperately reassigned.

3762
02:53:30.679 --> 02:53:33.353
General work banter.

3763
02:53:33.353 --> 02:53:34.746
TALIESIN: This is not a happy place.

3764
02:53:34.746 --> 02:53:36.844
MATT: You do hear some voices muffled
from down the staircase,

3765
02:53:36.844 --> 02:53:40.110
but, I would say even at this
distance, you're not able--

3766
02:53:40.110 --> 02:53:42.332
even with-- like you can hear them talking

3767
02:53:42.332 --> 02:53:45.118
through the stone, but you
can't make out any words.

3768
02:53:45.118 --> 02:53:46.859
I know you rolled super high, but like,

3769
02:53:46.859 --> 02:53:48.339
they're a floor below you and you're not Superman.

3770
02:53:48.339 --> 02:53:50.971
TALIESIN: Is it heated or
is it just-- can I discern

3771
02:53:50.971 --> 02:53:54.578
the general nature of the--
like, is it happy?

3772
02:53:54.578 --> 02:53:56.468
Just a conversation.
MATT: Just a conversation.

3773
02:53:56.468 --> 02:53:58.774
And it's short, because then
you immediately begin to hear

3774
02:53:58.774 --> 02:54:00.607
a number of sets of footsteps--

3775
02:54:00.607 --> 02:54:02.806
TALIESIN: They're coming.
MATT: --coming up the stairs.

3776
02:54:02.806 --> 02:54:05.274
You see rise back up the Martinet,

3777
02:54:05.274 --> 02:54:09.663
and behind you see the now twice familiar face

3778
02:54:09.663 --> 02:54:12.012
of Master Trent Ikithon approach.

3779
02:54:13.229 --> 02:54:16.812
(as Trent) "Well, so glad you all were able to join us.

3780
02:54:18.028 --> 02:54:19.964
"I've been notified of your arrival

3781
02:54:19.964 --> 02:54:24.964
"and we have prepared the demonstration,

3782
02:54:25.353 --> 02:54:27.426
"if you would please follow."

3783
02:54:27.426 --> 02:54:29.262
TRAVIS: How old is this dude again?

3784
02:54:29.262 --> 02:54:31.269
MATT: He looks to be in his sixties or seventies,

3785
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:33.785
somewhere in that range.

3786
02:54:33.785 --> 02:54:38.339
He's thin, older, human,
skin is a bit jaundiced.

3787
02:54:39.214 --> 02:54:42.528
You know, some visible
liver spots across the forehead.

3788
02:54:43.445 --> 02:54:46.411
You know, long, gray thinning hair,

3789
02:54:47.495 --> 02:54:52.028
and dressed in very, very nice robes

3790
02:54:52.028 --> 02:54:56.528
with like almost like a velvet

3791
02:54:57.698 --> 02:55:00.450
mantle over top of it that has
trim put into it.

3792
02:55:00.450 --> 02:55:03.451
It's very-- it's a little ostentatious for him

3793
02:55:03.451 --> 02:55:08.273
being on a business day,
but you know, he likes to dress up.

3794
02:55:08.273 --> 02:55:09.689
TRAVIS: Sure.

3795
02:55:09.689 --> 02:55:10.694
Okay.

3796
02:55:10.694 --> 02:55:11.765
MATT: You guys follow suit?

3797
02:55:11.765 --> 02:55:12.598
TRAVIS: Yep.
SAM: Sure.

3798
02:55:12.598 --> 02:55:13.649
MATT: All right.

3799
02:55:13.649 --> 02:55:16.233
You are led down beneath the ground floor

3800
02:55:16.233 --> 02:55:19.324
into a spiral staircase that comes to

3801
02:55:19.324 --> 02:55:22.071
a locked and closed door.

3802
02:55:22.071 --> 02:55:24.380
Ludinus approaches and just raises his hand,

3803
02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:26.585
and with a loud knocking sound the door

3804
02:55:26.585 --> 02:55:29.365
(imitates creaking) opens.

3805
02:55:29.365 --> 02:55:33.292
Immediately, the smell that
catches you is familiar.

3806
02:55:33.292 --> 02:55:37.483
It's like a strange, cold ozone type smell.

3807
02:55:39.517 --> 02:55:42.600
It reminds you of the sensory awareness

3808
02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:44.292
that would happen when you
would reach your consciousness

3809
02:55:44.292 --> 02:55:45.625
into the beacon.

3810
02:55:47.672 --> 02:55:50.890
As you step into the chamber,
this is a laboratory.

3811
02:55:50.890 --> 02:55:53.425
This is a specifically an arcane laboratory.

3812
02:55:53.425 --> 02:55:57.555
You can see all manner of bookshelves around.

3813
02:55:57.555 --> 02:56:00.941
There are numerous tables with glass vials

3814
02:56:00.941 --> 02:56:04.493
and alchemical supplies that
are affixed to each other

3815
02:56:04.493 --> 02:56:08.347
with, you know, copper coils
and a long, you know,

3816
02:56:08.347 --> 02:56:11.371
liquid carrying tubes that release into

3817
02:56:11.371 --> 02:56:16.371
heavy vials and liquid containers.

3818
02:56:17.939 --> 02:56:20.278
You can see materials that are locked away

3819
02:56:20.278 --> 02:56:22.951
and kept under glass along
a number of distant shelves

3820
02:56:22.951 --> 02:56:24.062
on the far wall.

3821
02:56:24.062 --> 02:56:26.272
There is a single chandelier
in the center of the room,

3822
02:56:26.272 --> 02:56:29.815
from the 15-foot tall ceiling, that dangles down

3823
02:56:29.815 --> 02:56:31.853
and gives off just a bright white light,

3824
02:56:31.853 --> 02:56:36.695
that gives a fairly consistent,
true color look

3825
02:56:36.695 --> 02:56:38.451
to the interior of the chamber.

3826
02:56:40.051 --> 02:56:43.455
In the center, you see a familiar-looking

3827
02:56:43.455 --> 02:56:46.021
platinum-colored tripod that sits

3828
02:56:47.046 --> 02:56:49.935
loosely near from underneath it,
not perfectly under,

3829
02:56:49.935 --> 02:56:53.060
but near underneath where
the chandelier hangs.

3830
02:56:54.043 --> 02:56:56.702
And two sides, you see two individuals

3831
02:56:56.702 --> 02:56:59.556
that are currently flanking it
from side to side.

3832
02:56:59.556 --> 02:57:02.430
One of them you see is a female halfling,

3833
02:57:03.422 --> 02:57:07.359
with shorter cut hair, a tense stare,

3834
02:57:07.359 --> 02:57:11.613
arms crossed, wearing sleeveless leather armor

3835
02:57:11.613 --> 02:57:14.123
with these like intricate tattoos

3836
02:57:14.123 --> 02:57:17.505
across each arm that have a very maze-like

3837
02:57:17.505 --> 02:57:19.472
geometric pattern to them.

3838
02:57:19.472 --> 02:57:23.437
The other you see as a tall man, short black hair,

3839
02:57:24.337 --> 02:57:28.545
built, thick, in a dark

3840
02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:31.753
piece of clothing

3841
02:57:31.753 --> 02:57:34.983
that covers most of his upper body, leather gauntlets,

3842
02:57:36.133 --> 02:57:38.271
looks to be a satchel overwind shoulder,

3843
02:57:38.271 --> 02:57:41.754
and is also equally looking stern at you

3844
02:57:41.754 --> 02:57:43.837
as you enter.
LIAM: Is it him?

3845
02:57:45.062 --> 02:57:46.497
MATT: Make a perception check.

3846
02:57:46.497 --> 02:57:47.330
SAM: "Him."

3847
02:57:47.330 --> 02:57:49.366
LAURA: His friend, is he his friend?

3848
02:57:51.258 --> 02:57:52.106
LIAM: 22.

3849
02:57:52.106 --> 02:57:53.370
MATT: 22?

3850
02:57:53.370 --> 02:57:55.580
It's been awhile, but yeah.

3851
02:57:57.405 --> 02:57:59.586
LAURA: It's the guy, it's the guy that he described.

3852
02:57:59.586 --> 02:58:00.669
MARISHA: His best friend.

3853
02:58:00.669 --> 02:58:02.869
SAM: Oh, oh, oh, that guy.

3854
02:58:05.127 --> 02:58:07.260
MATT: As you all step inside, both of them

3855
02:58:07.260 --> 02:58:10.333
acknowledge your entrance and take a step back

3856
02:58:10.333 --> 02:58:13.788
as Trent takes the center stage, if you will,

3857
02:58:13.788 --> 02:58:15.684
of the chamber.

3858
02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:20.684
"So you have inquired as to this beacon, this relic,

3859
02:58:20.937 --> 02:58:23.020
"to confirm its existence.

3860
02:58:24.051 --> 02:58:28.176
"So as Ludinus has told me, you all can approach

3861
02:58:28.176 --> 02:58:30.366
"and confirm for yourself."

3862
02:58:30.366 --> 02:58:31.808
SAM: May we touch it?

3863
02:58:31.808 --> 02:58:33.391
MATT: "If you wish, yes."

3864
02:58:34.493 --> 02:58:36.972
MARISHA: Yep, I go up there.

3865
02:58:36.972 --> 02:58:41.282
Also, as we walk up, I just want to start casing

3866
02:58:41.282 --> 02:58:43.199
the place a little bit. Any...

3867
02:58:46.418 --> 02:58:49.895
research papers, any notebooks--

3868
02:58:49.895 --> 02:58:53.614
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: Any signs of anything nearby.

3869
02:58:53.614 --> 02:58:55.056
Perception?

3870
02:58:56.193 --> 02:58:58.655
MATT: Hmm?
LAURA: The beacon is on top of the tripod?

3871
02:58:58.655 --> 02:59:01.239
MATT: It's on the tripod, yeah.
SAM: I guess.

3872
02:59:01.239 --> 02:59:03.322
MARISHA: 16.

3873
02:59:03.322 --> 02:59:04.523
MATT: You would imagine a chamber like this,

3874
02:59:04.523 --> 02:59:07.731
especially as outfitted with so many materials for research,

3875
02:59:07.731 --> 02:59:11.710
would have books and journals and notes everywhere.

3876
02:59:11.710 --> 02:59:13.355
Completely absent of any of it,

3877
02:59:13.355 --> 02:59:15.450
almost like it was recently cleared.

3878
02:59:15.450 --> 02:59:19.040
TRAVIS: How many doors and entry and exits are there?

3879
02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:20.668
MATT: There's the room you entered and there is a door

3880
02:59:20.668 --> 02:59:25.324
on the opposite wall, but you do not know where it goes.

3881
02:59:25.324 --> 02:59:27.493
LAURA: Mr. Icky-thong.

3882
02:59:27.493 --> 02:59:28.326
MATT: "Yes."

3883
02:59:28.326 --> 02:59:31.040
LAURA: How long have you had this relic?

3884
02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:32.032
MATT: "But a few weeks.

3885
02:59:32.032 --> 02:59:35.855
"We uncovered it, and we've been researching

3886
02:59:35.855 --> 02:59:38.266
"the extent of what it's capable of.

3887
02:59:38.266 --> 02:59:42.092
"With the rising conflict, we came to understand

3888
02:59:42.092 --> 02:59:45.568
"that this was one of the beacons that was so important

3889
02:59:45.568 --> 02:59:48.478
"to the Dynasty, and as this was
something that could be used

3890
02:59:48.478 --> 02:59:51.488
"as a weapon against us, it was necessary for us

3891
02:59:51.488 --> 02:59:55.851
"to ascertain information about how dangerous it would be,

3892
02:59:55.851 --> 02:59:58.297
"or if it could be used in our stead.

3893
02:59:58.297 --> 03:00:01.346
"Thankfully, that does not appear to be the case.

3894
03:00:01.346 --> 03:00:04.498
"It seems to be more important for them

3895
03:00:04.498 --> 03:00:08.717
"on a faith-based level, and as such,

3896
03:00:08.717 --> 03:00:11.740
"does not serve much of a continued purpose for us.

3897
03:00:11.740 --> 03:00:16.199
"Hence the lack of interest in maintaining it

3898
03:00:16.199 --> 03:00:17.373
"under our banner."

3899
03:00:17.373 --> 03:00:20.725
ASHLEY: Where did you--
LIAM: So it is not--

3900
03:00:20.725 --> 03:00:22.969
ASHLEY: Where did you uncover it?

3901
03:00:22.969 --> 03:00:24.247
MATT: "What do you mean?"

3902
03:00:24.247 --> 03:00:27.975
ASHLEY: Well, where did you, you said you uncovered it,

3903
03:00:27.975 --> 03:00:30.000
you found it?

3904
03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:33.647
MATT: "From what we understand, the relics

3905
03:00:33.647 --> 03:00:37.138
"that the Dynasty themselves

3906
03:00:37.138 --> 03:00:42.108
"have acquired are not the only beacons in his world.

3907
03:00:42.108 --> 03:00:46.405
"So this was uncovered as part of a archeological dig

3908
03:00:46.405 --> 03:00:47.940
"outside of Pride's Call."

3909
03:00:47.940 --> 03:00:51.003
LAURA: Mm, mm, mm, mm-hmm.

3910
03:00:51.003 --> 03:00:54.554
MATT: "But we are interested in returning it

3911
03:00:54.554 --> 03:00:57.979
"to those that have more use of it than we would."

3912
03:00:57.979 --> 03:00:59.399
LAURA: That's very kind of you.

3913
03:00:59.399 --> 03:01:02.985
TALIESIN: So this was uncovered there a few weeks ago?

3914
03:01:02.985 --> 03:01:03.818
MATT: "It was, yes.

3915
03:01:03.818 --> 03:01:06.575
"You are welcome to go and confirm that

3916
03:01:06.575 --> 03:01:08.680
"with the archeologists of Pride's Call as well."

3917
03:01:08.680 --> 03:01:09.513
TALIESIN: Excellent.

3918
03:01:09.513 --> 03:01:12.262
LAURA: I bet they totally would cooperate--

3919
03:01:12.262 --> 03:01:14.387
TALIESIN: Insight check for every

3920
03:01:14.387 --> 03:01:15.895
fucking thing this guy says.

3921
03:01:15.895 --> 03:01:17.127
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check.

3922
03:01:17.127 --> 03:01:18.279
MARISHA: Can I assist?
LAURA: I feel like we don't even

3923
03:01:18.279 --> 03:01:19.495
need to insight check this,

3924
03:01:19.495 --> 03:01:21.148
he's so full of shit!

3925
03:01:21.148 --> 03:01:22.862
TALIESIN: It's okay. 23.

3926
03:01:22.862 --> 03:01:23.911
MATT: 23? Okay.

3927
03:01:23.911 --> 03:01:25.219
TRAVIS: Did you roll with advantage?
MARISHA: Can I assist?

3928
03:01:25.219 --> 03:01:27.223
TALIESIN: Oh, I did not roll with advantage.

3929
03:01:27.223 --> 03:01:28.356
MATT: If you'd like to assist, sure.

3930
03:01:28.356 --> 03:01:30.309
MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

3931
03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:31.362
TALIESIN: 24.

3932
03:01:31.362 --> 03:01:33.496
MATT: All right, one point.
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah.

3933
03:01:33.496 --> 03:01:36.593
SAM: So many whispers tonight, guys.

3934
03:01:36.593 --> 03:01:38.139
MARISHA: Fucking liar!

3935
03:01:38.139 --> 03:01:39.164
Okay, wait.

3936
03:01:39.164 --> 03:01:43.822
There was news about Pride's Call back

3937
03:01:43.822 --> 03:01:44.980
a long time ago.

3938
03:01:44.980 --> 03:01:47.479
TRAVIS: Had to do with Obann.

3939
03:01:47.479 --> 03:01:50.885
SAM: Guys, this isn't combat, but Dwarven Forge exists,

3940
03:01:50.885 --> 03:01:52.705
just so you know.
LIAM: At all times.

3941
03:01:52.705 --> 03:01:55.636
SAM: At all times, they currently are a company

3942
03:01:55.636 --> 03:01:58.163
that exists at dwarvenforge.com.

3943
03:01:58.163 --> 03:01:59.678
MARISHA: To Pride's Call.
ASHLEY: Pride's Call.

3944
03:01:59.678 --> 03:02:01.206
SAM: Pride's Call, where's that?

3945
03:02:01.206 --> 03:02:02.039
TRAVIS: Right here.

3946
03:02:02.039 --> 03:02:04.032
MARISHA: On the ocean, right?

3947
03:02:04.032 --> 03:02:05.715
Oh, it's in the mountains.

3948
03:02:05.715 --> 03:02:08.253
LAURA: That's over by where your family lives, right?

3949
03:02:08.253 --> 03:02:09.679
MATT: It's on the other side of the mountain range

3950
03:02:09.679 --> 03:02:11.462
of the Cyrios Mountains from Kamordah.

3951
03:02:11.462 --> 03:02:13.318
It's a largely dwarven city.

3952
03:02:13.318 --> 03:02:14.270
MARISHA: Right, right, right, right.

3953
03:02:14.270 --> 03:02:18.283
LIAM: So you have found this object not to be dangerous--

3954
03:02:18.283 --> 03:02:22.293
and I let my eyes rest on Eodwulf's for a moment.

3955
03:02:22.293 --> 03:02:24.390
Is it of any use?

3956
03:02:24.390 --> 03:02:26.310
Surely you have learned something.

3957
03:02:26.310 --> 03:02:28.456
MATT: "It would be of use, yes.

3958
03:02:28.456 --> 03:02:32.046
"But what we've gleaned research-wise,

3959
03:02:33.355 --> 03:02:36.172
"what use it would have would not be as important

3960
03:02:36.172 --> 03:02:41.163
"as stemming the tide of blood that continues to flow

3961
03:02:41.163 --> 03:02:43.000
"because of this conflict."

3962
03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:43.883
LIAM: Agreed.

3963
03:02:43.883 --> 03:02:45.871
TALIESIN: Did you find the tripod with it?

3964
03:02:45.871 --> 03:02:47.960
This thing that it's sitting in?

3965
03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:51.891
MATT: "No, this was a means of keeping it safe

3966
03:02:51.891 --> 03:02:55.697
"and easy to research within our chamber."

3967
03:02:55.697 --> 03:02:57.046
MARISHA: Oh, really?
TALIESIN: Safe?

3968
03:02:57.046 --> 03:02:59.607
No, I'm curious how, like what is it,

3969
03:02:59.607 --> 03:03:02.541
how does it work? Is it-- we know about the thingy,

3970
03:03:02.541 --> 03:03:05.055
what's this tripod thingy like do?

3971
03:03:05.055 --> 03:03:08.193
MATT: "Well, when you are," and goes and reaches up.

3972
03:03:08.193 --> 03:03:10.475
I think you've touched it, right?

3973
03:03:10.475 --> 03:03:11.670
SAM: Yeah, is that okay?

3974
03:03:11.670 --> 03:03:12.645
MATT: Yeah, you touch it.

3975
03:03:12.645 --> 03:03:14.860
It very much resembles, feels like, and--

3976
03:03:14.860 --> 03:03:19.380
SAM: I was going to try to like let it zonk me in.

3977
03:03:19.380 --> 03:03:20.213
MATT: Okay.

3978
03:03:21.074 --> 03:03:23.419
You go ahead and focus in.

3979
03:03:23.419 --> 03:03:24.253
MARISHA: It takes like a minute.

3980
03:03:24.253 --> 03:03:26.528
MATT: It does. So you begin this process.

3981
03:03:27.994 --> 03:03:31.532
Ikithon goes, "Well, you see, when you are taking something

3982
03:03:31.532 --> 03:03:35.587
"that is, you are uncertain necessarily

3983
03:03:35.587 --> 03:03:40.222
"of how caustic or how volatile it may be."

3984
03:03:40.222 --> 03:03:42.877
TALIESIN: Okay, I know that one.

3985
03:03:42.877 --> 03:03:45.094
MATT: "How...

3986
03:03:45.094 --> 03:03:49.516
bad it might possibly end up."

3987
03:03:49.516 --> 03:03:51.197
TALIESIN: I'm with you.

3988
03:03:51.197 --> 03:03:52.656
MARISHA: So you made that?

3989
03:03:52.656 --> 03:03:53.629
MATT: "Yes,"

3990
03:03:53.629 --> 03:03:56.967
and he turns and sees. He was going to reach for it,

3991
03:03:56.967 --> 03:04:00.039
but then sees Nott instead currently in the process,

3992
03:04:00.039 --> 03:04:03.898
and goes, "(chuckles).

3993
03:04:03.898 --> 03:04:05.957
"You've seen this before, then."

3994
03:04:05.957 --> 03:04:08.616
LAURA: What, no, what?

3995
03:04:08.616 --> 03:04:10.932
MARISHA: Heard rumors.
ASHLEY: I have not seen it before.

3996
03:04:12.153 --> 03:04:16.215
MATT: "Well, I'm finding it curious that you have

3997
03:04:16.215 --> 03:04:18.516
"come here to confirm that something exists

3998
03:04:18.516 --> 03:04:21.701
"that you have not known it exists until you heard of it,

3999
03:04:21.701 --> 03:04:25.254
"not but the other day, and then arrive and immediately

4000
03:04:25.254 --> 03:04:29.395
"know exactly how to extend

4001
03:04:29.395 --> 03:04:31.413
"towards this device."

4002
03:04:31.413 --> 03:04:34.761
LIAM: By the act of touching?

4003
03:04:34.761 --> 03:04:37.199
She's a curious girl.

4004
03:04:37.199 --> 03:04:40.233
MATT: "I think you should know me better than to assume

4005
03:04:40.233 --> 03:04:43.624
"that I do not see intent

4006
03:04:43.624 --> 03:04:46.291
"where it's supposed to be, Bren.

4007
03:04:46.291 --> 03:04:50.416
"But I'm just curious.

4008
03:04:50.416 --> 03:04:52.524
"If you have encountered such a device before,

4009
03:04:52.524 --> 03:04:54.953
"your curiosity matches my own."

4010
03:04:55.861 --> 03:04:57.796
TALIESIN: How did you invent this tripod thingy?

4011
03:04:57.796 --> 03:04:59.717
It's kind of cool.

4012
03:04:59.717 --> 03:05:00.724
MATT: "We had it made.

4013
03:05:00.724 --> 03:05:02.880
"It's three broads of metal."

4014
03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:04.371
TALIESIN: No, I mean, but it's--

4015
03:05:04.371 --> 03:05:07.063
I mean, so you just had it made in the last couple weeks.

4016
03:05:07.063 --> 03:05:09.410
MATT: "Yes, we have that capability."

4017
03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:11.313
MARISHA: Is it one of a kind?

4018
03:05:11.313 --> 03:05:14.278
MATT: "Tripods? No, they're used
for many different devices."

4019
03:05:14.278 --> 03:05:17.454
MARISHA: Yeah, but that's like a very specific tripod

4020
03:05:17.454 --> 03:05:19.621
for a very specific shape.

4021
03:05:21.450 --> 03:05:22.476
MATT: "Okay."

4022
03:05:22.476 --> 03:05:24.711
(laughter)

4023
03:05:24.711 --> 03:05:26.534
TRAVIS: I too am curious where you--

4024
03:05:26.534 --> 03:05:28.472
MATT: "Are you offended by its shape?

4025
03:05:28.472 --> 03:05:30.612
"I could alter it for you, if you'd like."

4026
03:05:30.612 --> 03:05:32.618
LAURA: Whoa!
MATT: And he takes his hand and begins to

4027
03:05:32.618 --> 03:05:34.469
manipulate with his fingers, and while you're

4028
03:05:34.469 --> 03:05:36.778
concentrating on it, the tripod begins

4029
03:05:36.778 --> 03:05:38.565
to bow and twist a bit,

4030
03:05:38.565 --> 03:05:41.427
almost forming into a triple helix-type

4031
03:05:41.427 --> 03:05:43.647
formation, and Nott, you actually

4032
03:05:43.647 --> 03:05:45.801
are pulled away from connecting with it.

4033
03:05:45.801 --> 03:05:47.502
You do not finish the process.

4034
03:05:47.502 --> 03:05:50.316
SAM: Did it feel like it was going the right way?

4035
03:05:50.316 --> 03:05:51.324
MATT: It did.
SAM: Okay.

4036
03:05:51.324 --> 03:05:54.584
MATT: It did. And then it warps back, and he says,

4037
03:05:54.584 --> 03:05:57.659
"You understand at a certain point

4038
03:05:57.659 --> 03:06:00.837
"of arcane capability,

4039
03:06:00.837 --> 03:06:05.459
"such creations are relatively paltry tricks."

4040
03:06:05.459 --> 03:06:06.641
MARISHA: Oh, of course.

4041
03:06:06.641 --> 03:06:11.641
I also recognize a certain artist's touch

4042
03:06:11.641 --> 03:06:14.961
to these things, you know, and it's just very unique,

4043
03:06:14.961 --> 03:06:16.196
what you made there.

4044
03:06:16.196 --> 03:06:17.255
MATT: "Hmm.

4045
03:06:17.255 --> 03:06:20.220
"Have you seen them elsewhere before?"

4046
03:06:20.220 --> 03:06:22.891
MARISHA: Something reminiscent in Zadash, yeah.

4047
03:06:22.891 --> 03:06:23.977
MATT: "Interesting."

4048
03:06:23.977 --> 03:06:26.823
MARISHA: You get to Zadash much, Trent?
MATT: "Not terribly often.

4049
03:06:26.823 --> 03:06:28.093
"I am very busy up here."

4050
03:06:28.093 --> 03:06:30.792
SAM: Wasn't in Zadash. (pigeon cooing)

4051
03:06:30.792 --> 03:06:31.708
MARISHA: Hmm?

4052
03:06:31.708 --> 03:06:33.725
SAM: It wasn't in Zadash.

4053
03:06:33.725 --> 03:06:35.036
TRAVIS: Where was it?

4054
03:06:35.036 --> 03:06:36.484
SAM: Felderwin. (pigeon cooing)

4055
03:06:36.484 --> 03:06:38.084
TRAVIS: Felderwin?

4056
03:06:38.084 --> 03:06:40.112
MARISHA: But they had the beacon in Zadash.

4057
03:06:40.112 --> 03:06:42.460
ASHLEY: So there was a dig going on already?

4058
03:06:42.460 --> 03:06:44.318
I'm just getting clarification.

4059
03:06:44.318 --> 03:06:48.782
MATT: "There was a sinkhole that was discovered

4060
03:06:48.782 --> 03:06:52.156
"decades ago on the outskirts of Pride's Call

4061
03:06:52.156 --> 03:06:56.550
"that was found to lead to deep beneath the earth,

4062
03:06:56.550 --> 03:07:00.425
"an Arcanum ruin that has been

4063
03:07:00.425 --> 03:07:02.561
"a slow-going excavation

4064
03:07:02.561 --> 03:07:06.662
"that has been purposely and intently supervised

"by the Assembly since its discovery.

4066
03:07:09.699 --> 03:07:13.316
"And it was in this ruin such a beacon was discovered.

4067
03:07:13.316 --> 03:07:18.144
"We do not know if it was already part of the ruin,

4068
03:07:18.144 --> 03:07:21.840
"or it was through some sort of chance

4069
03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:24.667
"that the two had overlapped, but--"

4070
03:07:24.667 --> 03:07:26.021
ASHLEY: Oh.

4071
03:07:26.021 --> 03:07:30.765
TALIESIN: Have you figured out at all how it works?

4072
03:07:30.765 --> 03:07:35.765
MATT: "It has some strange arcane properties

4073
03:07:35.765 --> 03:07:39.690
"that are unlike things that we've encountered

4074
03:07:39.690 --> 03:07:41.773
"in some of our research."

4075
03:07:43.525 --> 03:07:47.036
TALIESIN: Have you ever seen an object like this before?

4076
03:07:47.036 --> 03:07:48.387
Anything like this before?

4077
03:07:48.387 --> 03:07:51.504
MATT: "No, this is beyond our purview.

4078
03:07:51.504 --> 03:07:54.021
"At least in my years on Exandria."

4079
03:07:54.021 --> 03:07:56.650
ASHLEY: You are so very excited that you found it.

4080
03:07:56.650 --> 03:07:58.138
MATT: "How would I not be?

4081
03:07:58.138 --> 03:08:00.191
"Is it not curious?

4082
03:08:00.191 --> 03:08:02.926
"Please, understand, I would love very much

4083
03:08:02.926 --> 03:08:05.809
"to continue to research such an artifact,

03:08:05.809 --> 03:08:10.262
"but once again, it's about being the bigger man."

4085
03:08:10.262 --> 03:08:12.177
LIAM: Tell us a little bit more.

4086
03:08:12.177 --> 03:08:14.279
Knowledge is power, you know that.

4087
03:08:14.279 --> 03:08:16.183
MATT: "It is."

4088
03:08:16.183 --> 03:08:19.208
LIAM: These properties, what are they?

4089
03:08:22.138 --> 03:08:24.805
MATT: Make a deception check for me.

4090
03:08:29.440 --> 03:08:30.840
LIAM: 14.

4091
03:08:33.753 --> 03:08:37.171
MATT: His gaze seems to almost to reach into you

4092
03:08:37.171 --> 03:08:41.160
in that cold and intrusive way, reading between the words

4093
03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:45.485
and the intent, and you see a smile creep across his face.

4094
03:08:46.925 --> 03:08:51.925
"I don't think it's anything you wouldn't already know.

4095
03:08:52.209 --> 03:08:57.184
"But I trust, for all of those present,

4096
03:08:58.295 --> 03:09:03.278
"it seems to have some roots in familiar

4097
03:09:03.278 --> 03:09:08.278
"magics that twist with the nature of matter and gravity,

4098
03:09:08.361 --> 03:09:13.361
"entropy, time, to a certain extent.
Probability, possibility.

4099
03:09:13.784 --> 03:09:17.987
"It is very intriguing, though the nature

4100
03:09:17.987 --> 03:09:20.253
"of this magic itself is

4101
03:09:21.928 --> 03:09:24.161
"challenging to harness."

4102
03:09:25.191 --> 03:09:26.717
(Laura sneezes)

4103
03:09:26.717 --> 03:09:29.953
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Bless you.
LAURA: Excuse me.

4104
03:09:29.953 --> 03:09:32.719
TRAVIS: I'm surprised to hear a man

4105
03:09:32.719 --> 03:09:35.755
of your intellect and intrigue

4106
03:09:35.755 --> 03:09:38.339
is ready to part with such a device

4107
03:09:38.339 --> 03:09:42.730
that the Dynasty seems to hold so much stock in.

4108
03:09:44.277 --> 03:09:47.962
Curious, have you been able to take anything from it,

4109
03:09:47.962 --> 03:09:51.583
or imbue any objects with its twisting

4110
03:09:51.583 --> 03:09:53.363
of matter and reality?

4111
03:09:53.363 --> 03:09:55.756
MATT: "Unfortunately it has not been enough time.

4112
03:09:55.756 --> 03:10:00.348
"But should this go well, should this,

4113
03:10:01.466 --> 03:10:05.866
"your endeavor with the Dynasty be successful,

4114
03:10:06.898 --> 03:10:09.279
"one would hope that this could be the beginning

4115
03:10:09.279 --> 03:10:12.013
"of a partnership, even.

4116
03:10:13.426 --> 03:10:17.943
"Perhaps if us and the Dynasty

4117
03:10:17.943 --> 03:10:22.136
"can cross these gaps

4118
03:10:22.136 --> 03:10:25.624
"of mistrust and misinformation,

4119
03:10:25.624 --> 03:10:28.738
"instead we can learn so much from each other."

4120
03:10:28.738 --> 03:10:30.257
TALIESIN: Are there books in this room?

4121
03:10:30.257 --> 03:10:31.463
MATT: There are many books in this room.

4122
03:10:31.463 --> 03:10:33.201
SAM: Oh. I thought you said everything was cleared.

4123
03:10:33.201 --> 03:10:35.229
MATT: No, there are books on the walls.

4124
03:10:35.229 --> 03:10:36.926
There are no notes, journals, or anything

4125
03:10:36.926 --> 03:10:39.698
that looks like research, but there are bookshelves.

4126
03:10:39.698 --> 03:10:42.246
TALIESIN: Do you have any of your
research in this room right now

4127
03:10:42.246 --> 03:10:44.410
that we could perhaps just take a quick look at,

4128
03:10:44.410 --> 03:10:46.423
see where you've gotten with it?

4129
03:10:46.423 --> 03:10:51.087
MATT: "No, and I, respectfully, was under the impression

4130
03:10:51.087 --> 03:10:53.394
"you were here to inspect this device.

4131
03:10:53.394 --> 03:10:58.046
"I've just met you, and our research is our own."

4132
03:10:58.046 --> 03:10:59.304
TRAVIS: Of course.

4133
03:10:59.304 --> 03:11:03.848
We've inspected the item, seems to be as you claim,

4134
03:11:03.848 --> 03:11:06.215
which will help, we can say we've seen it with our own eyes.

4135
03:11:06.215 --> 03:11:07.917
MATT: "Good."

4136
03:11:07.917 --> 03:11:10.284
TRAVIS: This will be a dangerous, dangerous task.

4137
03:11:10.284 --> 03:11:14.236
Perhaps if, I don't know, one of your more trusted

4138
03:11:14.236 --> 03:11:17.048
were to accompany us, I don't know.

4139
03:11:17.048 --> 03:11:20.764
Is there anyone you might want to have come with us?

4140
03:11:23.794 --> 03:11:26.803
SAM: What do you think, Caleb?

4141
03:11:26.803 --> 03:11:29.226
LIAM: (sighs)

4142
03:11:29.226 --> 03:11:33.309
I have not been a part of this for a very long time.

4143
03:11:34.707 --> 03:11:36.957
I wouldn't presume to know.

4144
03:11:39.095 --> 03:11:41.149
Who would I trust now?

4145
03:11:41.149 --> 03:11:42.315
MATT: "Hmm.

4146
03:11:44.543 --> 03:11:49.535
"Well, I think based on what we know

4147
03:11:49.535 --> 03:11:51.863
"of your dealings in Xhorhas, you would have a better chance

4148
03:11:51.863 --> 03:11:55.908
"of doing this without the presence

4149
03:11:55.908 --> 03:11:59.508
"of any of my trusted operatives."

4150
03:12:00.945 --> 03:12:03.499
LAURA: But you're so charming.

4151
03:12:03.499 --> 03:12:05.315
Wouldn't you want to come yourself

4152
03:12:05.315 --> 03:12:08.823
and charm the pants off of everyone there?

4153
03:12:09.985 --> 03:12:14.127
MATT: "I doubt the Assembly would be as welcomed."

4154
03:12:15.376 --> 03:12:19.440
TALIESIN: I would say if there's any other information

4155
03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:23.026
you feel that we should know, just so that all cards

4156
03:12:23.026 --> 03:12:25.334
are on the table, now would be the time

4157
03:12:25.334 --> 03:12:28.250
to put forward anything that might be

4158
03:12:28.250 --> 03:12:30.342
missing from this story, anything that when

4159
03:12:30.342 --> 03:12:33.326
we're asked questions, that we'll be able

4160
03:12:33.326 --> 03:12:35.676
to fill in the answers for it.
MATT: "Certainly."

4161
03:12:35.676 --> 03:12:38.647
LIAM: I think he's right, though.

4162
03:12:38.647 --> 03:12:42.363
His previous poking about in the Dynasty did not end well.

4163
03:12:47.463 --> 03:12:49.860
MATT: "You misunderstand.

4164
03:12:49.860 --> 03:12:54.666
"I have not myself traveled to the Dynasty."

4165
03:12:54.666 --> 03:12:58.148
LIAM: No, you don't do that, you don't need to.

4166
03:12:58.148 --> 03:13:00.598
You have help for that.

4167
03:13:04.036 --> 03:13:05.786
Always help for that.

4168
03:13:08.455 --> 03:13:11.439
MATT: "Not everyone is as helpful.

4169
03:13:16.241 --> 03:13:17.981
"Anyway."

4170
03:13:17.981 --> 03:13:19.060
TRAVIS: Yes.

4171
03:13:19.060 --> 03:13:23.069
MATT: "I believe everything is situated, Ludinus?"

4172
03:13:24.225 --> 03:13:25.746
"Very much so.

4173
03:13:25.746 --> 03:13:27.798
"Thank you, Master Ikithon.

4174
03:13:27.798 --> 03:13:30.959
"Once again, ensure that this is well-protected.

4175
03:13:30.959 --> 03:13:33.116
"I'm sure there would be outside forces

4176
03:13:33.116 --> 03:13:35.632
"very interested in such research and such a device,

4177
03:13:35.632 --> 03:13:38.189
"and that would be a terrible house of cards

4178
03:13:38.189 --> 03:13:40.741
"to befall these tense negotiations."

4179
03:13:40.741 --> 03:13:43.950
TRAVIS: Can I ask, is your dude that's across the room,

4180
03:13:43.950 --> 03:13:46.100
your friend, is he wearing the same thing

4181
03:13:46.100 --> 03:13:49.208
around his neck that you are?

4182
03:13:49.208 --> 03:13:51.375
MATT: Make a perception check.

4183
03:13:53.626 --> 03:13:56.187
LIAM: I mean, mine was always hidden under clothes.

4184
03:13:56.187 --> 03:13:57.444
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: 17?

4185
03:13:57.444 --> 03:13:59.640
You don't see anything.

4186
03:13:59.640 --> 03:14:01.066
TRAVIS: I'd love to have one of those.

4187
03:14:01.066 --> 03:14:03.641
MARISHA: Yeah, they're pretty cool.

4188
03:14:05.591 --> 03:14:10.474
MATT: "Mighty Nein, are you sufficiently happy?"

4189
03:14:10.474 --> 03:14:12.737
TRAVIS: We are satisfied.

4190
03:14:12.737 --> 03:14:13.646
TALIESIN: For the moment.

4191
03:14:13.646 --> 03:14:15.117
MATT: "Good.

4192
03:14:15.117 --> 03:14:16.771
"Thank you, Master Trent."

4193
03:14:16.771 --> 03:14:20.996
"Of course, and good luck."

4194
03:14:20.996 --> 03:14:22.319
TRAVIS: So terribly sorry.

4195
03:14:22.319 --> 03:14:25.458
Your two associates, I forgot to ask their names.

4196
03:14:25.458 --> 03:14:29.238
MATT: "My apologies, I'm usually
much more cordial than this.

4197
03:14:29.238 --> 03:14:32.096
"You caught me in the middle of my work mode.

4198
03:14:32.096 --> 03:14:36.076
"This is Uwaria, pointing to the halfling.

4199
03:14:36.076 --> 03:14:37.359
SAM: Uwellia?

4200
03:14:37.359 --> 03:14:41.904
MATT: "Uwaria. She is one of my more recent students,

4201
03:14:41.904 --> 03:14:46.151
"recently graduated, and this is Eodwulf,

03:14:48.925 --> 03:14:53.621
"and one of my favorite associates.

"I believe you two already know each other."

4205
03:14:57.529 --> 03:15:00.362
Eodwulf across the way is just--

4206
03:15:01.480 --> 03:15:03.507
LAURA: What do his arms look like?

4207
03:15:03.507 --> 03:15:05.230
MATT: They're covered currently.

4208
03:15:05.230 --> 03:15:10.230
There's a black, cotton cloth shirt

4209
03:15:10.651 --> 03:15:12.271
with leather gauntlets that are over it.

4210
03:15:12.271 --> 03:15:15.146
The arms are covered. Pretty wide shoulders.

4211
03:15:15.146 --> 03:15:17.921
For an individual that came to the Soltryce Academy

4212
03:15:17.921 --> 03:15:20.403
and what your usual standard expectation of a mage is,

4213
03:15:20.403 --> 03:15:22.534
he's a bigger guy.

4214
03:15:22.534 --> 03:15:24.088
TRAVIS: We're going to kill them all right now, right?

4215
03:15:24.088 --> 03:15:26.209
We're going to kick this thing off right now?

4216
03:15:26.209 --> 03:15:27.560
TALIESIN: Roll initiative.

4217
03:15:27.560 --> 03:15:29.065
(laughter)

4218
03:15:29.065 --> 03:15:33.877
MATT: Ludinus steps into this tension and goes,

4219
03:15:33.877 --> 03:15:38.868
"Well, I think we should find our way to the next endeavor.

4220
03:15:40.980 --> 03:15:42.435
"Let us be off."

4221
03:15:42.435 --> 03:15:43.877
MARISHA: Hey Trent.

4222
03:15:46.162 --> 03:15:47.712
MATT: "Yes?"

4223
03:15:47.712 --> 03:15:50.799
MARISHA: Might want to talk to Caduceus about

4224
03:15:50.799 --> 03:15:54.550
getting some tea that might help stimulate your memory.

4225
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:56.091
Keep a little bit sharper,

4226
03:15:56.091 --> 03:16:00.124
because we actually have met before.

4227
03:16:01.729 --> 03:16:04.237
MATT: "Oh, don't think I don't remember."

4228
03:16:04.237 --> 03:16:05.070
MARISHA: Oh.

4229
03:16:07.004 --> 03:16:09.996
So now I know you were lying.

4230
03:16:13.182 --> 03:16:15.849
MATT: "I not believe there was a lie.

4231
03:16:15.849 --> 03:16:18.460
"I congratulated on your victory in the pit."

4232
03:16:18.460 --> 03:16:20.990
MARISHA: Yeah, you seem to have just misplaced

4233
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:24.259
that we had all met previously, like a moment ago.

4234
03:16:24.259 --> 03:16:26.813
MATT: "I'd only met a handful of you."

4235
03:16:26.813 --> 03:16:30.001
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4236
03:16:30.001 --> 03:16:34.918
ASHLEY: I put my hand on my blade,
on the handle of my blade.

4237
03:16:38.485 --> 03:16:43.466
MATT: "You, apparently, have been following

4238
03:16:43.466 --> 03:16:46.866
"an intriguing pass on your own as well.

"Have a good day."

LAURA: Can you read minds?

4244
03:17:02.478 --> 03:17:05.349
MATT: "Can I read minds?"
LAURA: Yeah.

4245
03:17:05.349 --> 03:17:06.699
MATT: "Can you?"

4246
03:17:07.737 --> 03:17:09.307
LAURA: Can you?

4247
03:17:10.948 --> 03:17:12.865
MATT: "You're a strange one.

4248
03:17:16.036 --> 03:17:18.247
"Are you reading my mind right now?"

4249
03:17:18.247 --> 03:17:20.955
LAURA: I'm trying to give you some thoughts.

4250
03:17:20.955 --> 03:17:23.622
Tell me the first thing I think.

4251
03:17:24.732 --> 03:17:28.612
MATT: "I think it's time we said goodbye."

4252
03:17:28.612 --> 03:17:31.112
LAURA: He didn't want to say it out loud.

4253
03:17:31.112 --> 03:17:34.020
MATT: Ludinus is like, "Ahem.

4254
03:17:34.020 --> 03:17:35.585
"Shall we?"

4255
03:17:35.585 --> 03:17:36.712
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

LIAM: Wulf.

4258

It's good to see you again.

MATT: "It's good to see you too.

4260
03:17:49.748 --> 03:17:52.204
"It's been some time.

4261
03:17:52.204 --> 03:17:53.588
"You look good."

4262
03:17:57.442 --> 03:17:58.542
LIAM: Let's go.

4263
03:18:01.504 --> 03:18:05.403
MATT: You head back up the stairs, and you hear the

4264
03:18:05.403 --> 03:18:09.091
door (creaking) behind you,

4265
03:18:09.091 --> 03:18:11.372
and as you reach the landing above where the guards are,

4266
03:18:11.372 --> 03:18:15.440
the Martinet turns and goes, "My apologies for the tension.

4267
03:18:15.440 --> 03:18:19.111
"I was afraid, given the history,

4268
03:18:19.111 --> 03:18:23.389
"things would be a bit emotional.

4269
03:18:23.389 --> 03:18:25.829
"Trent is a challenging individual.

03:18:25.829 --> 03:18:30.820
"He has much utility, and has been a longstanding,

03:18:34.067 --> 03:18:37.116
"important member of the Assembly,

4272
03:18:37.116 --> 03:18:39.944
"but he is challenging."

4273
03:18:39.944 --> 03:18:42.294
LIAM: Have you ever--
LAURA: He does bad things.

4274
03:18:42.294 --> 03:18:45.672
LIAM: Have you ever sat in on any of his lessons?

4275
03:18:45.672 --> 03:18:49.379
MATT: "I have not sat in on them specifically.

4276
03:18:50.529 --> 03:18:52.600
"But he does what he deems necessary.

4277
03:18:52.600 --> 03:18:55.283
"Not all things necessary are easy."

4278
03:18:56.595 --> 03:18:59.349
TALIESIN: Do you have an opinion on any of the conversation

4279
03:18:59.349 --> 03:19:00.499
you just heard?

4280
03:19:01.365 --> 03:19:02.698
MATT: "In regards to?"

4281
03:19:05.433 --> 03:19:09.450
TALIESIN: Feelings, thoughts, a candid emotion.

4282
03:19:09.450 --> 03:19:11.487
MATT: "I think he's not being entirely forthright

4283
03:19:11.487 --> 03:19:13.644
"with his knowledge or information about this,

4284
03:19:13.644 --> 03:19:18.628

03:19:18.628 --> 03:19:20.315
"To press this individual right now

4286
03:19:20.315 --> 03:19:21.999
"would be a rabbit hole that would distract

4287

"from something that is far more reaching.

4288
03:19:27.461 --> 03:19:30.192
"I can always deal with Trent after the fact."

03:19:30.192 --> 03:19:34.123
ASHLEY: Let us know when you do that
because I would like to help.

4290
03:19:34.123 --> 03:19:36.089
If you need to...

4291
03:19:38.323 --> 03:19:40.375
get rid of him in any way.

4292
03:19:40.375 --> 03:19:43.336
MATT: "(chuckling)

4293
03:19:43.336 --> 03:19:45.935
"There are far more useful ways of dealing

4294
03:19:45.935 --> 03:19:49.344
"with useful individuals than just getting rid of them."

4295
03:19:49.344 --> 03:19:52.594
LAURA: Are you a lot more powerful than him?

4296
03:19:53.907 --> 03:19:57.037
MATT: "It's challenging to compare power in the Assembly.

"We all have our unique talents."

03:20:00.715 --> 03:20:03.418
LAURA: Are you being humble?

4299

MATT: "I'm being honest."

4300
03:20:06.849 --> 03:20:10.350
TALIESIN: Where do you think we should go next?

4301
03:20:10.350 --> 03:20:12.836
MATT: "Well, if you have any preparations to make,

4302
03:20:12.836 --> 03:20:15.956
"anything you need to do, the timeline is yours.

"but do know time is of the essence."

4307
03:20:25.602 --> 03:20:28.293
TALIESIN: We-- I feel like I would like a moment

4308
03:20:28.293 --> 03:20:31.000
to talk amongst ourselves really quickly,

4309
03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:32.958
but I don't know if I feel comfortable

4310
03:20:32.958 --> 03:20:34.782
having that conversation here.

4311
03:20:34.782 --> 03:20:38.164
SAM: Can you teleport us back to the city center?

4312
03:20:38.164 --> 03:20:39.456
MATT: "I can."
SAM: Yes.

4313
03:20:39.456 --> 03:20:41.146
TALIESIN: Or somewhere else, maybe?

4314
03:20:41.146 --> 03:20:43.440
LAURA: Can teleport anywhere?

4315
03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:45.125
MATT: "I can teleport many places."

4316
03:20:45.125 --> 03:20:46.903
LAURA: Because, like, you did it like really, like,

4317
03:20:46.903 --> 03:20:49.748
fast and, like, it looked really cool

4318
03:20:49.748 --> 03:20:53.040
when you did it and stuff.
TALIESIN: Where's safe?

4319
03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:55.335
LAURA: Like, you must be really powerful.

4320
03:20:56.427 --> 03:20:58.712
MATT: "Do you have a particular request where to be taken?"

4321
03:20:58.712 --> 03:20:59.987
LAURA: No, I'm just saying that, like,

4322
03:20:59.987 --> 03:21:01.477
I've seen other people try to do it,

4323
03:21:01.477 --> 03:21:02.678
but they've almost, like, bamfed us

4324
03:21:02.678 --> 03:21:05.385
into trees or rocks or something, and you were just like,

4325
03:21:05.385 --> 03:21:07.946
whoosh and we're in the like the grass.

4326
03:21:07.946 --> 03:21:10.316
MATT: "It's easier the more familiar
you are with the location."

4327
03:21:10.316 --> 03:21:11.149
LAURA: Oh.

4328
03:21:11.149 --> 03:21:13.979
TRAVIS: Essek is scrying us going, "Fucking--"
MARISHA: I know.

4329
03:21:13.979 --> 03:21:17.327
MATT: (laughs)
TRAVIS: "One time!"

4330
03:21:17.327 --> 03:21:21.611
SAM: I think we still have business in Rexxentrum, no?

4331
03:21:21.611 --> 03:21:23.841
MATT: "Then we can return."

4332
03:21:23.841 --> 03:21:25.900
LIAM: We are on our own timeline, you're saying.

4333
03:21:25.900 --> 03:21:29.908
Obviously, speed is of the essence, but--

4334
03:21:29.908 --> 03:21:31.491
LAURA: What is the date?

4335
03:21:33.453 --> 03:21:36.777
MATT: If you're requesting about
the immediacy of Traveler Con,

4336
03:21:36.777 --> 03:21:38.020
you have about a month.

4337
03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:39.477
LAURA: Still, we got about a month still?

4338
03:21:39.477 --> 03:21:40.404
MATT: You got a month.

4339
03:21:40.404 --> 03:21:42.341
It's around the corner.

4340
03:21:42.341 --> 03:21:45.084
LAURA: Let's go, we got to get the ship, we got to get--

4341
03:21:45.084 --> 03:21:47.945
SAM: Did you get your advent calendar for Traveler Con?

4342
03:21:47.945 --> 03:21:49.896
MATT: (laughs)

4343
03:21:49.896 --> 03:21:51.688
TALIESIN: It's just dicks in boxes.

4344
03:21:51.688 --> 03:21:55.113
SAM: Every box is a box of dicks.

4345
03:21:55.113 --> 03:21:57.272
(Matt and Laura laughing)

4346
03:21:57.272 --> 03:22:00.281
TRAVIS: I do admit, I'm not
entirely familiar with Rexxentrum.

4347
03:22:00.281 --> 03:22:03.469
Are there any shops of arcane nature,

4348
03:22:03.469 --> 03:22:05.101
or perhaps somewhere where we might be able

4349
03:22:05.101 --> 03:22:07.934
to peruse items that will help us?

4350
03:22:09.460 --> 03:22:12.760
MATT: "If you're inquiring about

4351
03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:14.760

TRAVIS: Perhaps there is a stock set aside

4360
03:22:36.935 --> 03:22:40.543
for the Empire's more clandestine efforts?

4361
03:22:42.793 --> 03:22:46.823
MATT: "What are you planning to do at a negotiation?"

4362
03:22:46.823 --> 03:22:47.953
TRAVIS: I don't know.

4363
03:22:47.953 --> 03:22:49.545
I like options.

4364
03:22:50.791 --> 03:22:52.473

TRAVIS: I am new to Melora's light and guidance.

4371
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:18.456
She's served me well, and I hope to return the favor.

4372
03:23:18.456 --> 03:23:21.767
MATT: "Well, you seem to have endured and survived

4373

TRAVIS: Goodness.

SAM: His heart.

TRAVIS: Well, I am good with a sword.

4379
03:23:38.013 --> 03:23:41.215
And I'll summon the Star Razor.

4380
03:23:41.215 --> 03:23:43.977
MATT: As it appears in his hand, he takes a step back

4381
03:23:43.977 --> 03:23:47.247
and looks down, eyes wide and nodding

4382
03:23:47.247 --> 03:23:51.421
with a very genuine look of being impressed and goes,

SAM: Yes, yes, away.

MATT: Bends the same similar circle inscription in the air,

4399
03:24:30.556 --> 03:24:33.055
and as it expands and pulls all of you

4400
03:24:33.055 --> 03:24:36.189
into its center, (whooshing) and thrusts you through again,

4401
03:24:36.189 --> 03:24:39.793
landing at the exterior base of his tower

4402
03:24:39.793 --> 03:24:42.967

TRAVIS: Very impressive, very impressive.

4404
03:24:45.021 --> 03:24:47.928
That's very impressive.

TALIESIN: It feels appropriate.

4407

MATT: "Anyway."
LAURA: I mean,

4408
03:24:54.819 --> 03:24:56.868
how often do you get to, like, really show off your power?

4409
03:24:56.868 --> 03:24:59.557
You know, like most people are probably used to seeing it,

4410
03:24:59.557 --> 03:25:01.429
so it's not as impressive anymore.

4411
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:05.297
But like, we've never seen anything like it, so, you know.

4412
03:25:05.297 --> 03:25:06.627
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4413

03:25:45.416 --> 03:25:46.732
MATT: "Of course,"

4429
03:25:46.732 --> 03:25:50.313
and he walks around the edge of his tower out of sight.

4430
03:25:50.313 --> 03:25:52.138
LAURA: Are you okay, Caleb?

4431
03:25:53.212 --> 03:25:54.387
LIAM: Um.

4432
03:25:56.977 --> 03:25:59.726
I don't know.

4433
03:25:59.726 --> 03:26:01.192
ASHLEY: I don't like him at all.

4434
03:26:01.192 --> 03:26:02.025
TALIESIN: No.

4435
03:26:02.025 --> 03:26:03.447
TRAVIS: Which one, Trent or this one?

4436
03:26:03.447 --> 03:26:05.775
LAURA: Well, the Martinet's really actually pretty cool,

4437
03:26:05.775 --> 03:26:07.155
I like him.
SAM: Uh-uh.

4438
03:26:07.155 --> 03:26:08.440
TALIESIN: I will say--

4439
03:26:08.440 --> 03:26:11.143
SAM: You remember he held my husband prisoner.

4440
03:26:11.143 --> 03:26:12.047
LAURA: That was him?

4441
03:26:12.047 --> 03:26:13.752
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Yes.

4442
03:26:13.752 --> 03:26:14.968
LAURA: That was him?
SAM: Yep.

4443
03:26:14.968 --> 03:26:16.147
LIAM: Likely.

4444
03:26:16.147 --> 03:26:19.093
MARISHA: He's also totally like a religious bigoted asshole

4445
03:26:19.093 --> 03:26:21.900
who fucking, like, they--

4446
03:26:21.900 --> 03:26:23.264
TRAVIS: We've walked away at this point.

4447
03:26:23.264 --> 03:26:24.831
MARISHA: Yeah, we're out, by the way, yeah.

4448
03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:27.637
ASHLEY: Martinet held your husband?

4449
03:26:27.637 --> 03:26:29.580
SAM: Uh-huh.
LAURA: I thought that was Trent.

4450
03:26:29.580 --> 03:26:30.429
SAM: Nope.

4451
03:26:30.429 --> 03:26:31.337
He was in Felderwin.
MATT: Note of interest:

4452
03:26:31.337 --> 03:26:33.561
Wildmother: not legal in the Empire,

4453
03:26:33.561 --> 03:26:35.187
but did not call you on it.

4454
03:26:35.187 --> 03:26:36.814
LAURA: He's just better at lying.

4455
03:26:36.814 --> 03:26:38.011
TRAVIS: Really?
TALIESIN: Well.

4456
03:26:38.011 --> 03:26:39.476
MATT: He seemed unfazed.

4457
03:26:39.476 --> 03:26:41.557
TRAVIS: That's right. There's only a few deities.

4458
03:26:41.557 --> 03:26:44.436
MATT: There's only a handful that
are legal within the Empire.

4459
03:26:44.436 --> 03:26:48.294
TALIESIN: Trent didn't-- I've never--

4460
03:26:48.294 --> 03:26:51.360
I've never seen another person

4461
03:26:51.360 --> 03:26:54.188
walk so daintily around the truth.

4462
03:26:55.070 --> 03:26:56.137
LAURA: Ugh.
TALIESIN: I wouldn't even know

4463
03:26:56.137 --> 03:26:57.566
what he looked like when he was lying.

4464
03:26:57.566 --> 03:27:00.539
MARISHA: I mean, he lied so many times, like openly.

4465
03:27:00.539 --> 03:27:02.622
TALIESIN: He didn't lie.
LAURA: That's what you do.

4466
03:27:02.622 --> 03:27:04.922
Did you see? I just asked him one stupid little question

4467
03:27:04.922 --> 03:27:06.822
and he went on this long-ass story.

4468
03:27:06.822 --> 03:27:09.201
Like, that's how you know someone's lying,

4469
03:27:09.201 --> 03:27:11.787
they give you all these details you didn't ask for.

4470
03:27:11.787 --> 03:27:14.447
MARISHA: We've seen him in Zadash multiple times,

4471
03:27:14.447 --> 03:27:15.980
and he's like, "Meh, I don't go to Zadash,"

4472
03:27:15.980 --> 03:27:17.955
and then you're just like, "I've never met you before,"

4473
03:27:17.955 --> 03:27:20.560
and then I called him on it, and he's like,

4474
03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:21.644
"What are you talking about?"

4475
03:27:21.644 --> 03:27:22.477
He sucks.

4476
03:27:22.477 --> 03:27:27.237
TALIESIN: I was following him, he

4477
03:27:27.237 --> 03:27:31.684
technically didn't really, (sighs).

4478
03:27:31.684 --> 03:27:32.892
LAURA: Lie?
TALIESIN: Nope.

4479
03:27:32.892 --> 03:27:34.448
LAURA: He just spoke around the truth.

4480
03:27:34.448 --> 03:27:35.552
TALIESIN: Yep.

4481
03:27:35.552 --> 03:27:38.234
MARISHA: He's like me, but better at it.

4482
03:27:38.234 --> 03:27:40.605
Fucking asshole.
TRAVIS: He's not focused on this stage.

4483
03:27:40.605 --> 03:27:42.547
I think can all agree on that, yes?

4484
03:27:42.547 --> 03:27:45.645
LIAM: Ikithon is more obvious, but Da'leth

4485
03:27:45.645 --> 03:27:48.168
was not entirely truthful with us, either.

4486
03:27:48.168 --> 03:27:49.668
MARISHA: Mm-mm.

4487
03:27:49.668 --> 03:27:51.515
TALIESIN: Are we, yeah.

4488
03:27:51.515 --> 03:27:53.898
ASHLEY: I don't mean to pry, Caleb,

4489
03:27:53.898 --> 03:27:57.664
but he was a teacher for you?

4490
03:28:00.628 --> 03:28:03.380
LIAM: I am from here, near here.

4491
03:28:03.380 --> 03:28:04.796
ASHLEY: I gathered that much.

4492
03:28:04.796 --> 03:28:06.213
LIAM: I studied here.

4493
03:28:08.624 --> 03:28:12.041
Ikithon was a one of many teachers,

4494
03:28:12.041 --> 03:28:15.200
and then he became my main teacher.

4495
03:28:17.206 --> 03:28:18.539
Private lessons.

4496
03:28:21.975 --> 03:28:24.165
You've missed so much.

4497
03:28:24.165 --> 03:28:25.360
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know.

4498
03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:28.230
LAURA: Did he ever seem, like, nice to you,

4499
03:28:28.230 --> 03:28:30.368
or was he always weird?

4500
03:28:30.368 --> 03:28:31.760
LIAM: Sometimes.

4501
03:28:32.653 --> 03:28:37.644
Sometimes, after being particularly harsh,

4502
03:28:39.568 --> 03:28:41.651
he would apologize after.

4503
03:28:43.265 --> 03:28:45.200
ASHLEY: That can be very confusing.

4504
03:28:45.200 --> 03:28:47.129
MARISHA: It's fucked up.

4505
03:28:47.129 --> 03:28:50.104
Especially if you have no one else to go to.

4506
03:28:54.303 --> 03:28:55.779
LIAM: We should not take anything they said

4507
03:28:55.779 --> 03:28:58.877
at face value, obviously.

4508
03:28:58.877 --> 03:29:02.332
It's pretty clear that we are being used as a pawn.

4509
03:29:02.332 --> 03:29:03.165
LAURA: Yeah.

4510
03:29:05.032 --> 03:29:06.548
LIAM: We have to be very careful.
LAURA: I feel like they've done

4511
03:29:06.548 --> 03:29:07.439
something to the beacon.

4512
03:29:07.439 --> 03:29:08.897
I feel like they had to have done something.

4513
03:29:08.897 --> 03:29:11.480
TRAVIS: Of course they have.
MARISHA: Yeah, did you get your thing?

4514
03:29:11.480 --> 03:29:12.474
Did you get it?

4515
03:29:12.474 --> 03:29:15.756
SAM: No, no, I was interrupted, but it certainly felt real.

4516
03:29:15.756 --> 03:29:18.406
It's not a decoy or anything.

4517
03:29:18.406 --> 03:29:19.989
It's the real deal.

4518
03:29:21.034 --> 03:29:23.201
At least from what I felt.

4519
03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:27.148
MARISHA: From when we witnessed
the Zauber Spire get attacked,

4520
03:29:27.148 --> 03:29:32.148
and we saw those flying wizard battles

4521
03:29:32.197 --> 03:29:34.183
and the Kryn and shit.

4522
03:29:34.183 --> 03:29:36.259
LIAM and MATT: One of them was Ikithon.

4523
03:29:36.259 --> 03:29:37.989
You didn't recognize the other.

4524
03:29:37.989 --> 03:29:39.976
TRAVIS: (nervous laugh) Cool.

4525
03:29:39.976 --> 03:29:43.922
MARISHA: But like, now that we've met other people

4526
03:29:43.922 --> 03:29:48.922
in the Assembly, can we think back?

4527
03:29:49.079 --> 03:29:51.945
Did, like--

4528
03:29:51.945 --> 03:29:54.828
the Martinet has a cane,

4529
03:29:54.828 --> 03:29:57.966
you mentioned one of them had a staff or something.

4530
03:29:57.966 --> 03:29:59.425
Has there been any identifying things

4531
03:29:59.425 --> 03:30:00.949
that we can remember?

4532
03:30:00.949 --> 03:30:01.921
LIAM: They all look different.

4533
03:30:01.921 --> 03:30:04.464
One of them is an earth genasi, and--

4534
03:30:04.464 --> 03:30:05.424
MARISHA: Right, that's what I'm saying.

4535
03:30:05.424 --> 03:30:06.825
Is there something we didn't recognize

4536
03:30:06.825 --> 03:30:09.829
at the time, but now looking back,

4537
03:30:09.829 --> 03:30:11.554
where it feels like this person?

4538
03:30:11.554 --> 03:30:14.313
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

4539
03:30:16.078 --> 03:30:17.322
TRAVIS: Don't you roll that blue one,

4540
03:30:17.322 --> 03:30:19.028
don't you touch that damn thing.

4541
03:30:19.028 --> 03:30:21.442
LAURA: Can I Guidance you?

4542
03:30:21.442 --> 03:30:22.682
MATT: You wouldn't know about this.

4543
03:30:22.682 --> 03:30:24.257
LAURA: But you're thinking so hard!

4544
03:30:24.257 --> 03:30:25.429
MATT: (laughs)

4545
03:30:25.429 --> 03:30:27.187
This is just recalling information.

4546
03:30:27.187 --> 03:30:29.207
TRAVIS: Trying to decide whether to gamble on a fart or not.

4547
03:30:29.207 --> 03:30:31.017
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right.

4548
03:30:31.017 --> 03:30:32.444
19.

4549
03:30:32.444 --> 03:30:34.807
MATT: The other figure, best that you can recall

4550
03:30:34.807 --> 03:30:36.852
and what little bit you saw--
MARISHA: 18.

4551
03:30:36.852 --> 03:30:39.216
MATT: Seemed to resemble or Oremid Hass.

4552
03:30:39.216 --> 03:30:41.371
LAURA: Who? Oremid Hass?
MARISHA: Oremid Hass.

4553
03:30:41.371 --> 03:30:45.259
MATT: Who, of which that school is-- he's the headmaster

4554
03:30:45.259 --> 03:30:49.010
of the Hall of Erudition, which is

4555
03:30:49.010 --> 03:30:50.721
the school that was attacked.

4556
03:30:50.721 --> 03:30:53.263
MARISHA: I mean, we dealt with him a decent amount, too.

4557
03:30:53.263 --> 03:30:56.474
TALIESIN: They didn't mention that they were experimenting

4558
03:30:56.474 --> 03:30:57.972
with this thing earlier, they didn't mention

4559
03:30:57.972 --> 03:30:59.423
that they used to have another one.

4560
03:30:59.423 --> 03:31:02.155
LAURA: No, they were lying.

4561
03:31:02.155 --> 03:31:03.317
LIAM: Of course.

4562
03:31:03.317 --> 03:31:05.400
TALIESIN: So here's the question.

4563
03:31:06.445 --> 03:31:11.271
Are we going to put our chips on this Ludinus?

4564
03:31:11.271 --> 03:31:13.357
And if we are going to put our chips,

4565
03:31:13.357 --> 03:31:15.510
are we really going to do it?

4566
03:31:15.510 --> 03:31:20.330
SAM: I mean, in fairness to them, they told us the truth.

4567
03:31:20.330 --> 03:31:24.318
They know we're going to go talk to the Bright Queen.

4568
03:31:24.318 --> 03:31:26.144
They don't want us to say, "hey, Bright Queen,

4569
03:31:26.144 --> 03:31:28.678
"these fuckers stole the last one from you,

4570
03:31:28.678 --> 03:31:30.823
"and they stole another one from you."

4571
03:31:30.823 --> 03:31:31.983
They don't want us to have that information

4572
03:31:31.983 --> 03:31:34.579
and give it to the Bright Queen.

4573
03:31:34.579 --> 03:31:37.176
TALIESIN: That's what she already thinks, though.

4574
03:31:37.176 --> 03:31:39.527
SAM: Thinks, but may not be able to prove.

4575
03:31:39.527 --> 03:31:42.755
LIAM: Also, how do we use this situation?
TALIESIN: I don't know if it matters.

4576
03:31:43.855 --> 03:31:46.496
LIAM: To reach what we want?

4577
03:31:46.496 --> 03:31:50.626
SAM: Well, ultimately we do want both sides to talk.

4578
03:31:50.626 --> 03:31:51.459
TRAVIS: We do.

4579
03:31:51.459 --> 03:31:53.881
LIAM: Yes, but they are being disingenuous here.

4580
03:31:53.881 --> 03:31:56.501
They are not being forthright.

4581
03:31:56.501 --> 03:31:57.755
They want to use this for something

4582
03:31:57.755 --> 03:32:00.378
that we are not seeing yet.

4583
03:32:00.378 --> 03:32:02.803
And we can be honest-- I'm sorry, Fjord.

4584
03:32:02.803 --> 03:32:04.352
TRAVIS: No, no, that's okay.

4585
03:32:04.352 --> 03:32:07.523
Do we think the Empire is aware

4586
03:32:07.523 --> 03:32:09.635
of where the Bright Queen is?

4587
03:32:09.635 --> 03:32:11.410
Are they using us as a--

4588
03:32:11.410 --> 03:32:12.879
MARISHA: Way to find her?

4589
03:32:12.879 --> 03:32:14.405
MARISHA: Yes.

4590
03:32:14.405 --> 03:32:17.301
Something to flush them out, to follow us.

4591
03:32:17.301 --> 03:32:21.604
MARISHA: Rosohna is famously the capital of Xhorhas.

4592
03:32:21.604 --> 03:32:25.104
MATT: Yeah there isn't a mystery of
where Rosohna is, you know.,

4593
03:32:25.104 --> 03:32:26.206
LIAM: It's the Kremlin.

4594
03:32:26.206 --> 03:32:27.089
MATT: Yeah.

4595
03:32:27.089 --> 03:32:30.977
It's just far and well guarded.

4596
03:32:30.977 --> 03:32:33.177
MARISHA: I mean, there were assassins

4597
03:32:33.177 --> 03:32:36.120
trying to invade Rosohna while we were there.

4598
03:32:36.120 --> 03:32:37.711
MATT: Yeah, Scourgers already attacked it.

4599
03:32:37.711 --> 03:32:41.481
It's not like it's a mystery.

4600
03:32:41.481 --> 03:32:43.833
LIAM: We're in the middle, we could certainly try

4601
03:32:43.833 --> 03:32:47.115
to take this beacon to them and inspect it

4602
03:32:47.115 --> 03:32:49.521
and try to make sure that we are not being used,

4603
03:32:50.437 --> 03:32:52.577
but it's not going to lead to peace.

4604
03:32:52.577 --> 03:32:57.088
MARISHA: They mentioned us corroborating their story

4605
03:32:57.088 --> 03:32:59.149
with the architects of Pride's Call.

4606
03:32:59.149 --> 03:33:01.185
I mean, of course they could have given

4607
03:33:01.185 --> 03:33:04.943
those dwarves any amount of money to pay them off, I'm sure.

4608
03:33:04.943 --> 03:33:06.882
LAURA: Or they just changed their memory.

4609
03:33:06.882 --> 03:33:07.905
MARISHA: Or just changed their memory,

4610
03:33:07.905 --> 03:33:11.458
but we could try and beat them at the only hint

4611
03:33:11.458 --> 03:33:14.454
that they've potentially given us and go investigate that.

4612
03:33:14.454 --> 03:33:18.271
TALIESIN: There is another hand to play.

4613
03:33:21.741 --> 03:33:26.016
We could sit and cast a truth spell

4614
03:33:26.016 --> 03:33:30.227
with Ludinus and just try and have a frank conversation

4615
03:33:30.227 --> 03:33:33.009
with the understanding that we both get to ask questions,

4616
03:33:33.009 --> 03:33:34.474
and sometimes that answer's going to be

4617
03:33:34.474 --> 03:33:36.737
"I'm not comfortable answering that."

4618
03:33:36.737 --> 03:33:38.477
TRAVIS: I don't know if he would agree to that.

4619
03:33:38.477 --> 03:33:40.839
TALIESIN: He might.
LAURA: I don't think he would.

4620
03:33:40.839 --> 03:33:43.614
TALIESIN: As long as we're okay
with him occasionally saying,

4621
03:33:43.614 --> 03:33:48.197
"I'm not going to answer that," for whatever that's worth.

4622
03:33:49.182 --> 03:33:52.127
SAM: I can't see him agreeing to that.

4623
03:33:52.127 --> 03:33:55.182
LIAM: Or if he did, he would just pass on the questions

4624
03:33:55.182 --> 03:33:56.988
that he doesn't want to answer.

4625
03:33:56.988 --> 03:33:57.821
TALIESIN: But we would know that

4626
03:33:57.821 --> 03:34:00.903
when he is being forthright, he's being forthright.

4627
03:34:00.903 --> 03:34:02.552
TRAVIS: It's worth a shot, I think we should go

4628
03:34:02.552 --> 03:34:04.893
to the Cryptic Collection, see what we can find

4629
03:34:04.893 --> 03:34:07.507
in this town, perhaps try our luck with Ludinus.

4630
03:34:07.507 --> 03:34:10.094
And I'd actually like Beau's idea.

4631
03:34:10.094 --> 03:34:11.988
Might as well see what we can find in Pride's Call

4632
03:34:11.988 --> 03:34:14.400
before we just jump into another continent.

4633
03:34:14.400 --> 03:34:16.718
Sorry, Empire, Dynasty.

4634
03:34:16.718 --> 03:34:18.940
MARISHA: I mean, if they did alter memories or pay them off

4635
03:34:18.940 --> 03:34:23.273
or do something, maybe someone saw something and can

4636
03:34:26.159 --> 03:34:28.250
tell us something, I dunno.

4637
03:34:30.921 --> 03:34:32.585
TRAVIS: Anyone up for shopping?

4638
03:34:32.585 --> 03:34:34.376
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Sure.

4639
03:34:34.376 --> 03:34:35.848
SAM: You always ask that.

4640
03:34:35.848 --> 03:34:39.147
MARISHA: Therapy shop, therapy shop!
(Matt chuckling)

4641
03:34:39.147 --> 03:34:40.601
TALIESIN: That is the first time I've ever heard

4642
03:34:40.601 --> 03:34:43.305
Travis say "anyone up for shopping," by the way.

4643
03:34:43.305 --> 03:34:44.953
Just marking the occasion.

4644
03:34:44.953 --> 03:34:45.860
MATT: Yeah.

4645
03:34:45.860 --> 03:34:46.928
I think everyone has to drink.

4646
03:34:46.928 --> 03:34:48.178
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4647
03:34:51.744 --> 03:34:53.077
MATT: All right. So.

4648
03:34:56.554 --> 03:34:59.398
I would say, while you do not know where this place is,

4649
03:34:59.398 --> 03:35:01.573
asking around,

4650
03:35:04.106 --> 03:35:06.439
the right people, you eventually get sent

4651
03:35:06.439 --> 03:35:08.024
towards the Court of Colors, which is in

4652
03:35:08.024 --> 03:35:10.433
the Tangles section of the city.

4653
03:35:10.433 --> 03:35:12.738
You find, nestled in the shaded gap

4654
03:35:12.738 --> 03:35:17.005
between two large warehouses, that the alleyway ends

4655
03:35:17.005 --> 03:35:21.087
not in a cul-de-sac or come to an abrupt stop

4656
03:35:21.087 --> 03:35:22.839
at another building.

4657
03:35:22.839 --> 03:35:25.119
Instead it ends in a humble if somewhat creepy

4658
03:35:25.119 --> 03:35:27.670
single-story building of rustic, weathered wood,

4659
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:29.287
and a tiled roof decorated with numerous

4660
03:35:29.287 --> 03:35:32.486
brass and iron chimes, wind instruments,

4661
03:35:32.486 --> 03:35:35.403
and charms dangling from the edges.

4662
03:35:36.640 --> 03:35:38.457
TALIESIN: That's pretty nice.

4663
03:35:38.457 --> 03:35:42.440
MATT: Within this long back, shotgun-style structure,

4664
03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:47.440
you walk in to find a warm, strangely humid apothecary,

4665
03:35:48.092 --> 03:35:50.948
and minor magical relic store.

4666
03:35:50.948 --> 03:35:54.301
The interior itself is--

4667
03:35:54.301 --> 03:35:56.231
I'm trying to find the proper--

4668
03:35:56.231 --> 03:35:58.505
LAURA: What is the name? The Cultivated--?

4669
03:35:58.505 --> 03:35:59.731
MATT and SAM: The Cryptic Collection.

4670
03:35:59.731 --> 03:36:01.135
LAURA: The Cryptic Collection.

4671
03:36:01.135 --> 03:36:03.810
MATT: You see a number of cages hanging from the top

4672
03:36:03.810 --> 03:36:06.601
of the entryway and small corner elements

4673
03:36:06.601 --> 03:36:08.977
that are all moss-covered,

4674
03:36:08.977 --> 03:36:11.851
and just glancing over the side, you can see rats

4675
03:36:11.851 --> 03:36:15.978
kept in one, you can see ravens in another,
an owl in the back.

4676
03:36:15.978 --> 03:36:19.493
General familiar-type creatures being kept.
MARISHA: What's the owl look like?

4677
03:36:19.493 --> 03:36:20.725
Does it look like fucking Thaddeus?

4678
03:36:20.725 --> 03:36:23.096
MATT: Make a perception check.

4679
03:36:23.096 --> 03:36:24.017
SAM: It's definitely Thaddeus.

4680
03:36:24.017 --> 03:36:26.482
TALIESIN: I like that you give a side-eye
to every owl we ever meet.

4681
03:36:26.482 --> 03:36:28.192
MARISHA: Fuck, it's just perception?
MATT: Yeah.

4682
03:36:28.192 --> 03:36:29.668
MARISHA: Seven.

4683
03:36:29.668 --> 03:36:32.246
MATT: It's fine, it's an owl, it's not Thaddeus.
MARISHA: Well.

4684
03:36:32.246 --> 03:36:34.560
(Matt and Marisha laughing)

4685
03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:35.468
MARISHA: If it was, though.

4686
03:36:35.468 --> 03:36:36.889
MATT: If it was, that'd be hilarious.

4687
03:36:36.889 --> 03:36:38.263
LIAM: It's the Crawling King.

4688
03:36:38.263 --> 03:36:40.463
TRAVIS: (snarling)
MATT: (laughs)

4689
03:36:40.463 --> 03:36:41.671
TRAVIS: It's gnawing at the bars.

4690
03:36:41.671 --> 03:36:45.060
TALIESIN: We're not ready to fight that. Yeah, yeah.

4691
03:36:45.060 --> 03:36:47.473
Four more levels minimum.

4692
03:36:47.473 --> 03:36:50.652
MATT: As you've move through the entryway,

4693
03:36:50.652 --> 03:36:53.031
some of the ravens start cawing for a moment.

4694
03:36:53.031 --> 03:36:55.366
The rats start squeaking, just, you know,

4695
03:36:55.366 --> 03:36:56.630
acknowledging the arrival

4696
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:58.226
of something strange and new.

4697
03:36:58.226 --> 03:37:00.009
LAURA: Hold on to Sprinkle.

4698
03:37:00.009 --> 03:37:01.744
Don't worry.

4699
03:37:01.744 --> 03:37:04.178
SAM: Leave me in one of the cages, please.

4700
03:37:04.178 --> 03:37:06.735
(laughter)

4701
03:37:06.735 --> 03:37:09.178
MATT: You see across some of the nearby tables,

4702
03:37:09.178 --> 03:37:13.464
chiseled and polished bones are on display,

4703
03:37:13.464 --> 03:37:15.793
marked with runes and decorative carvings.

4704
03:37:15.793 --> 03:37:17.717
You can see a femur that has been made

4705
03:37:17.717 --> 03:37:21.094
into some sort of a flute-like instrument.

4706
03:37:21.094 --> 03:37:22.599
TRAVIS: Ooh.
LAURA: Whoa.

4707
03:37:22.599 --> 03:37:25.257
MATT: The entire room smells of musky earth

4708
03:37:25.257 --> 03:37:29.461
and mildewed leather, yet with every few steps,

4709
03:37:29.461 --> 03:37:32.405
the smells seem to change into something else entirely.

4710
03:37:32.405 --> 03:37:34.495
This is a very surreal corner to find

4711
03:37:34.495 --> 03:37:38.426
lost in the middle of the Court of Colors region

4712
03:37:38.426 --> 03:37:40.690
of Rexxentrum.

4713
03:37:40.690 --> 03:37:44.765
As the birds and creatures start getting louder and louder,

4714
03:37:44.765 --> 03:37:46.049
You can see, on the opposite end,

4715
03:37:46.049 --> 03:37:49.841
a curtain that pulls to the side, and a figure comes out,

4716
03:37:49.841 --> 03:37:51.521
and as it does, they all get quiet.

4717
03:37:51.521 --> 03:37:52.963
TRAVIS: Ooh, dope.

4718
03:37:54.553 --> 03:37:59.492
MATT: You see what looks to be a half-elven woman

4719
03:37:59.492 --> 03:38:03.059
in probably her 50s or so, heavy-set

4720
03:38:03.059 --> 03:38:06.313
with tangled, dirty blonde hair,

4721
03:38:06.313 --> 03:38:11.306
and this wide smile of teeth that are too white

4722
03:38:11.306 --> 03:38:14.673
for the somewhat dirty and disheveled exterior

4723
03:38:14.673 --> 03:38:15.923
that she holds.

4724
03:38:17.064 --> 03:38:21.461
She steps forward, arms behind her back.

4725
03:38:21.461 --> 03:38:22.719
"Hello.

4726
03:38:24.267 --> 03:38:26.734
"Welcome to the Cryptic Collection.

4727
03:38:26.734 --> 03:38:29.054
"My name is Keona the Keen.

4728
03:38:29.054 --> 03:38:30.723
"Can I help you?"
SAM: I love her.

4729
03:38:30.723 --> 03:38:32.144
MARISHA: Me too.

4730
03:38:32.144 --> 03:38:33.451
She's my favorite already.

4731
03:38:33.451 --> 03:38:35.219
LIAM: Keona the King?
SAM: Keana.

4732
03:38:35.219 --> 03:38:37.390
MATT: Keona the Keen.

4733
03:38:37.390 --> 03:38:38.886
LIAM: Keona the Keen.

4734
03:38:38.886 --> 03:38:41.551
TRAVIS: Well, Keona, we are first-time purveyors

4735
03:38:41.551 --> 03:38:43.093
of your establishment.

4736
03:38:43.093 --> 03:38:44.184
MATT: "Apparently."

4737
03:38:44.184 --> 03:38:49.184
LAURA: Martinet Lu-- he sent us. He sends his regards.

4738
03:38:49.517 --> 03:38:50.982
TRAVIS: Martinet Ludinus Da'leth.

4739
03:38:50.982 --> 03:38:53.795
MATT: "The Martinet sent you here?"

4740
03:38:53.795 --> 03:38:56.258
SAM: He said you might have some potions

4741
03:38:56.258 --> 03:38:58.737
and fancy magicky things for us.

4742
03:38:58.737 --> 03:39:00.475
MATT: "We just might."

4743
03:39:00.475 --> 03:39:02.885
She puts her arms out.
LAURA: What do her hands look like?

4744
03:39:02.885 --> 03:39:05.403
MATT: Her fingers are longer than they should be

4745
03:39:05.403 --> 03:39:08.176
for a standard half-elf.

4746
03:39:08.176 --> 03:39:11.285
Probably about an inch to an inch and a half longer.

4747
03:39:11.285 --> 03:39:15.827
They're thin, and the nails themselves extend--
SAM: Are they press-on nails?

4748
03:39:15.827 --> 03:39:18.318
TALIESIN: Press-on fingers.
MATT: Yes. (laughing)

4749
03:39:18.318 --> 03:39:19.709
TRAVIS: Are there little paintings on each of them?

4750
03:39:19.709 --> 03:39:21.828
LIAM: Let me just call the Martinet.

4751
03:39:21.828 --> 03:39:25.126
(laughter)

4752
03:39:25.126 --> 03:39:26.067
TRAVIS: I love that.

4753
03:39:26.067 --> 03:39:27.433
MATT: It's a little unsettling.

4754
03:39:27.433 --> 03:39:30.011
It's not hag level.

4755
03:39:30.011 --> 03:39:33.009
She's not, but it's just different and strange.

4756
03:39:33.009 --> 03:39:35.166
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

4757
03:39:35.166 --> 03:39:37.520
MATT: "So, what are you looking for?

4758
03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:40.977
"We have a few curiosities.

4759
03:39:40.977 --> 03:39:45.802
"Times have been busy, so we're a bit plucked clean, but..."

4760
03:39:47.292 --> 03:39:49.850
TRAVIS: Perhaps the more rare, the better.

4761
03:39:49.850 --> 03:39:53.986
items of defense or offense.

4762
03:39:53.986 --> 03:39:55.229
MATT: "Oh."

4763
03:39:55.229 --> 03:39:57.303
She starts putting away a small satchel.

4764
03:39:57.303 --> 03:39:59.297
TALIESIN: I was going to talk about potions and diamonds,

4765
03:39:59.297 --> 03:40:00.220
but what is this?

4766
03:40:00.220 --> 03:40:02.062
I'm going to pick up the femur and show it.

4767
03:40:02.062 --> 03:40:05.358
LAURA: I'm just drawing her in my book, like--

4768
03:40:05.358 --> 03:40:07.358
(laughter)

4769
03:40:07.358 --> 03:40:09.009
SAM: A hand study?

4770
03:40:09.009 --> 03:40:11.725
MATT: "I call that a cruzela.

4771
03:40:11.725 --> 03:40:14.627
"It's an original instrument.

4772
03:40:14.627 --> 03:40:15.787
"Let me show you."
LAURA: Ooh!

4773
03:40:15.787 --> 03:40:17.929
MATT: She reaches out and takes it, the fingers (slurping)

4774
03:40:17.929 --> 03:40:19.168
wrap around.
SAM: Ooh!

4775
03:40:19.168 --> 03:40:21.153
MATT: Bring it back.
(Laura laughing)

4776
03:40:21.153 --> 03:40:24.617
As she holds it, like, her hands don't touch it,

4777
03:40:24.617 --> 03:40:25.989
because her fingers have to go out far

4778
03:40:25.989 --> 03:40:27.969
to touch, and there are number of

4779
03:40:27.969 --> 03:40:32.735
flute holes all alongside it, and she blows in.

4780
03:40:32.735 --> 03:40:35.911
You're expecting music, and instead this like high pitched

4781
03:40:35.911 --> 03:40:38.569
(light screeching),

4782
03:40:38.569 --> 03:40:42.203
this weird wail sound comes out,

4783
03:40:42.203 --> 03:40:44.277
and as she transitions her fingers,

4784
03:40:44.277 --> 03:40:46.717
it glides unnaturally from sound to sound.

4785
03:40:46.717 --> 03:40:51.112
You know the death whistle sound?

4786
03:40:51.112 --> 03:40:53.246
TALIESIN: Bless you.
MATT: It's not as aggressive as that,

4787
03:40:53.246 --> 03:40:56.113
but it is not music in a classic sense.

4788
03:40:56.113 --> 03:40:58.339
It's very unsettling.

4789
03:40:58.339 --> 03:41:00.341
TRAVIS: How much audible damage to we take?

4790
03:41:00.341 --> 03:41:01.807
MATT: Let's see here.

4791
03:41:01.807 --> 03:41:04.315
(laughter)

4792
03:41:04.315 --> 03:41:05.430
And hands it back to you.

4793
03:41:05.430 --> 03:41:06.551
TALIESIN: That's fascinating.

4794
03:41:06.551 --> 03:41:08.422
LAURA: What does it do?

4795
03:41:08.422 --> 03:41:11.172
MATT: "It makes music."
LAURA: Oh.

4796
03:41:13.312 --> 03:41:14.808
"50 gold, if you're interested."

4797
03:41:14.808 --> 03:41:15.875
TALIESIN: I'm very interested.

4798
03:41:15.875 --> 03:41:17.059
MATT: "Good, good."

4799
03:41:17.059 --> 03:41:18.991
(Marisha laughing)

4800
03:41:18.991 --> 03:41:21.659
TALIESIN: What else do you got? This is exciting.

4801
03:41:21.659 --> 03:41:24.176
MATT: "Well," she takes the satchel back up and opens it up,

4802
03:41:24.176 --> 03:41:27.025
and there are four potions in there.

4803
03:41:28.075 --> 03:41:31.492
There's a potion of healing, two potions of greater healing,

4804
03:41:31.492 --> 03:41:34.817
and a potion of superior healing.

4805
03:41:36.666 --> 03:41:37.640
TRAVIS: One, two, and one.

4806
03:41:37.640 --> 03:41:38.473
MATT: Yes.

4807
03:41:39.601 --> 03:41:42.330
TALIESIN: And no diamonds, I assume, either.

4808
03:41:42.330 --> 03:41:43.987
TRAVIS: We have to ask.

4809
03:41:43.987 --> 03:41:45.570
MATT: No diamonds in that one.

4810
03:41:46.627 --> 03:41:47.791
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4811
03:41:48.824 --> 03:41:50.182
We're all right, just not great.

4812
03:41:50.182 --> 03:41:51.844
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh!

4813
03:41:53.144 --> 03:41:55.499
Do you have a fancy bowl?

4814
03:41:55.499 --> 03:41:57.156
SAM: A what?
MATT: "A fancy bow?"

4815
03:41:57.156 --> 03:41:59.739
LAURA: A fancy bowl.
MATT: "Bowl!"

4816
03:41:59.739 --> 03:42:00.906
SAM: You need that? For what?

4817
03:42:00.906 --> 03:42:02.650
MATT: "I think I can provide that.

4818
03:42:02.650 --> 03:42:04.755
"What kind of bowl are you looking for?

4819
03:42:04.755 --> 03:42:07.667
"And diamonds I can also acquire,

4820
03:42:07.667 --> 03:42:09.786
"though I may have to remove them from their setting,

4821
03:42:09.786 --> 03:42:13.091
"depending on how expensive you're looking?"

4822
03:42:13.091 --> 03:42:15.616
TALIESIN: Well, it depends on
what you got, and I, honestly,

4823
03:42:15.616 --> 03:42:17.592
I'm still just sort of
captivated with this thing.

4824
03:42:17.592 --> 03:42:19.000
What other--

4825
03:42:20.449 --> 03:42:22.607
you seem to have taste.

4826
03:42:22.607 --> 03:42:23.737
MATT: "Thank you."

4827
03:42:23.737 --> 03:42:25.451
TALIESIN: I'm just curious if you got anything else

4828
03:42:25.451 --> 03:42:27.762
so impressive just hanging around.

4829
03:42:27.762 --> 03:42:29.767
MATT: "Oh, have you got some time, then?"

4830
03:42:29.767 --> 03:42:31.773
TALIESIN: Now I do.
MATT: "(laughs excitedly)"

4831
03:42:31.773 --> 03:42:32.932
TRAVIS: Ha!

4832
03:42:32.932 --> 03:42:36.828
Most aroused Caduceus has ever been.
MARISHA: Yeah, I know, yeah.

4833
03:42:36.828 --> 03:42:40.162
MATT: "The standard potion of healing
is 50 gold pieces,

4834
03:42:40.162 --> 03:42:44.409
"the greater 150, and the superiors 450.

4835
03:42:44.409 --> 03:42:48.090
"These are prices as a friend of Ludinus'."

4836
03:42:48.090 --> 03:42:50.079
TRAVIS: Understood. Thank you for that.

4837
03:42:50.079 --> 03:42:51.731
LAURA: A gem-encrusted bowl.

4838
03:42:51.731 --> 03:42:55.145
A bowl with gem crusting.

4839
03:42:55.145 --> 03:42:56.334
SAM: Crusty gems.

4840
03:42:56.334 --> 03:42:59.794
MATT: "Crusty gems on a bowl?

4841
03:42:59.794 --> 03:43:01.450
"To what worth are you looking for?"

4842
03:43:01.450 --> 03:43:02.483
LAURA: 1000 gold.

4843
03:43:02.483 --> 03:43:03.913
MATT: "1000.

4844
03:43:03.913 --> 03:43:07.147
"I do not have that at the moment,

4845
03:43:07.147 --> 03:43:08.606
"but if you give me a couple days,

4846
03:43:08.606 --> 03:43:11.606
"I can probably procure something similar."

4847
03:43:12.748 --> 03:43:15.934
LAURA: I think I have that much money.

4848
03:43:15.934 --> 03:43:17.205
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4849
03:43:17.205 --> 03:43:19.635
No, I know, but I-- I have
a similar amount.

4850
03:43:19.635 --> 03:43:20.848
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4851
03:43:20.848 --> 03:43:23.057
TRAVIS: Certainly take all of
those healing potions.

4852
03:43:23.057 --> 03:43:26.246
It's 114 gold each.
MARISHA: Done.

4853
03:43:26.246 --> 03:43:27.225
SAM: We're all chipping in?

4854
03:43:27.225 --> 03:43:28.197
LAURA: We're all chipping in.

4855
03:43:28.197 --> 03:43:30.150
TALIESIN: 114?

4856
03:43:30.150 --> 03:43:31.299
TRAVIS: Gold.

4857
03:43:35.783 --> 03:43:40.424
TALIESIN: And I'm just throw down
the 50 for the flute.

4858
03:43:40.424 --> 03:43:42.555
Because I need that.
MATT: Go for it.

4859
03:43:42.555 --> 03:43:44.008
TALIESIN: I need that.

4860
03:43:44.008 --> 03:43:48.589
114, that's 164 gold.

4861
03:43:48.589 --> 03:43:52.111
But I want to see what else you got.
MATT: "This," as she pulls up this

4862
03:43:52.111 --> 03:43:55.236
small black marble about that big.

4863
03:43:56.563 --> 03:43:59.190
Sets it out, it's a black-gray color.

4864
03:44:00.548 --> 03:44:03.072
"There was a larger set, but,

4865
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:06.223
"I've had a couple of break-ins

4866
03:44:06.223 --> 03:44:09.486
"and had to use a few of them,
but these are referred to

4867
03:44:09.486 --> 03:44:11.120
"as beads of force.

4868
03:44:12.986 --> 03:44:16.458
"You're unhappy with something,
you throw it at it,

4869
03:44:16.458 --> 03:44:19.143
"and it becomes not a problem
for a short time."

4870
03:44:20.052 --> 03:44:21.275
MARISHA: How much?
TRAVIS: Beads of force?

4871
03:44:21.275 --> 03:44:24.612
SAM: Beads of force.
MATT: "250, but I only have one."

4872
03:44:26.728 --> 03:44:29.010
MARISHA: And that's with, like, the friend deal?

4873
03:44:29.010 --> 03:44:30.095
MATT: "Yes."

4874
03:44:30.095 --> 03:44:31.597
LAURA: That's a good deal.

4875
03:44:31.597 --> 03:44:32.712
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take it.

4876
03:44:32.712 --> 03:44:33.679
MATT: "All right."

4877
03:44:37.023 --> 03:44:38.504
MARISHA: 250, is that what you said?

4878
03:44:38.504 --> 03:44:39.841
MATT: 250.

4879
03:44:39.841 --> 03:44:41.523
LIAM: Do you have any gemstones?

4880
03:44:41.523 --> 03:44:43.513
Do you have any amber?

4881
03:44:43.513 --> 03:44:45.821
MATT: "There is amber, yes,
I can provide amber.

4882
03:44:45.821 --> 03:44:47.401
"How much are you looking?"

4883
03:44:47.401 --> 03:44:51.593
LIAM: I would like five individual pieces,

4884
03:44:52.695 --> 03:44:54.211
A minimum of...

4885
03:44:55.661 --> 03:44:58.231
200 gold's worth.

4886
03:44:58.231 --> 03:44:59.290
MATT: "All right."
LIAM: Roughly.

4887
03:44:59.290 --> 03:45:01.123
MATT: "That can be provided."

4888
03:45:01.123 --> 03:45:03.804
She goes behind the curtain
for a bit and comes back,

4889
03:45:03.804 --> 03:45:06.019
and has in her hand,
her arm and her fingers

4890
03:45:06.019 --> 03:45:10.165
unfurl slowly, and in the palm,
you can see these--

4891
03:45:10.165 --> 03:45:13.589
they're different sizes,
but they're all very large

4892
03:45:13.589 --> 03:45:16.070
and polished pieces of amber.

4893
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:19.997
Lets them cascade onto the table in front.

4894
03:45:19.997 --> 03:45:24.322
LIAM: I slide 200 gold over.

4895
03:45:24.322 --> 03:45:25.487
MATT: She scoops them in.

4896
03:45:25.487 --> 03:45:28.173
TALIESIN: If you have a 350 gold piece diamond,

4897
03:45:28.173 --> 03:45:30.502
or a 500 gold piece diamond, or one of each,

4898
03:45:30.502 --> 03:45:32.097
we would happily take it.

4899
03:45:32.097 --> 03:45:35.626
MATT: "I have a 350 gold piece."

4900
03:45:35.626 --> 03:45:36.496
TALIESIN: We'll take it.

4901
03:45:36.496 --> 03:45:37.930
MATT: "That I can handle."

4902
03:45:37.930 --> 03:45:39.221
TALIESIN: You want that one?
MATT: Goes and retrieves

4903
03:45:39.221 --> 03:45:40.725
such a diamond for you.

4904
03:45:40.725 --> 03:45:43.636
It's not cut.

4905
03:45:43.636 --> 03:45:44.986
It's a larger diamond, but it's uncut,

4906
03:45:44.986 --> 03:45:46.716
which is why the price isn't full.

4907
03:45:46.716 --> 03:45:48.837
It's a little rough, but it'll work for

4908
03:45:48.837 --> 03:45:51.652
any sort of, you know, material component elements

4909
03:45:51.652 --> 03:45:52.659
you require.

4910
03:45:52.659 --> 03:45:54.174
TALIESIN: I know you've got platinum, nevermind.

4911
03:45:54.174 --> 03:45:55.782
MATT: "And this is the--

4912
03:45:55.782 --> 03:45:57.215
"this is the interesting one."

4913
03:45:57.215 --> 03:45:59.513
SAM: Oh.
MATT: "This is hard to find."

4914
03:46:01.808 --> 03:46:04.716
"It requires some creativity.

4915
03:46:05.763 --> 03:46:07.280
"(excited exhale),"

4916
03:46:07.280 --> 03:46:10.089
And sets this small vial down.

4917
03:46:10.089 --> 03:46:12.643
Now this here in particular, you see

4918
03:46:12.643 --> 03:46:17.369
in this jar, it's a larger
vial or a small jar.

4919
03:46:17.369 --> 03:46:20.717
There is this viscous, milky fluid in it

4920
03:46:20.717 --> 03:46:23.410
that has a mercury-type movement to it,

4921
03:46:23.410 --> 03:46:25.308
but it is a milky-white color.

4922
03:46:26.442 --> 03:46:29.513
"This is an adhesive.

4923
03:46:29.513 --> 03:46:33.146
"When it's placed between two objects,

4924
03:46:33.146 --> 03:46:34.946
"they bond.

4925
03:46:34.946 --> 03:46:36.446
"Forever."

4926
03:46:38.105 --> 03:46:42.414
LAURA: Like, if we put it, like,
some on me and some on Nott,

4927
03:46:42.414 --> 03:46:44.434
and then we stood next to each other,

4928
03:46:44.434 --> 03:46:46.560
we went to permanently be together forever?

4929
03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:49.927
MATT: "If you wait the minute
for it to set, yes."

4930
03:46:49.927 --> 03:46:50.950
TRAVIS: A minute for it to set.

4931
03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:53.626
TALIESIN: Is there any way that-- to--

4932
03:46:53.626 --> 03:46:55.488
MATT: "There is.

4933
03:46:55.488 --> 03:46:58.514
"There are some other magical solvents,

4934
03:46:58.514 --> 03:47:00.873
"like a universal solvent could perhaps remove it,

4935
03:47:00.873 --> 03:47:04.994
"or an oil of etherealness to lose the physicality

4936
03:47:04.994 --> 03:47:09.008
"of one such object, and there's always a wish."

4937
03:47:09.008 --> 03:47:10.589
TALIESIN: That's too mean, nevermind.

4938
03:47:10.589 --> 03:47:11.580
SAM: How much is that?

4939
03:47:11.580 --> 03:47:12.774
TRAVIS: It takes a minute to set.

4940
03:47:12.774 --> 03:47:16.333
LAURA: But any strength and it won't
be able to pull it apart?

4941
03:47:16.333 --> 03:47:19.588
MATT: "Impossible outside of those scenarios."

4942
03:47:19.588 --> 03:47:21.613
SAM: How much?
LAURA: How much?

4943
03:47:21.613 --> 03:47:23.954
MATT: "It's only two ounces, so it's two uses,

4944
03:47:23.954 --> 03:47:28.954
"but it'll run you,
for the entire jar, 600 gold.

4945
03:47:29.331 --> 03:47:31.361
SAM: I'll go halfsies with you.

4946
03:47:31.361 --> 03:47:32.764
LAURA: All my money's going to be gone, but--

4947
03:47:32.764 --> 03:47:35.753
SAM: I'll just pay for the whole thing myself.

4948
03:47:35.753 --> 03:47:37.503
LAURA: That's really good.

4949
03:47:39.548 --> 03:47:41.786
I can put in 200 for it.

4950
03:47:41.786 --> 03:47:43.266
SAM: I'll put down four.
TRAVIS: Do it.

4951
03:47:43.266 --> 03:47:45.934
Pour it between your butt cheeks
and never poop again.

4952
03:47:45.934 --> 03:47:47.498
(laughter)

4953
03:47:47.498 --> 03:47:49.873
SAM: Oh, get those fingers away from me!

4954
03:47:49.873 --> 03:47:50.951
(laughter)

4955
03:47:50.951 --> 03:47:52.079
LAURA: You want to keep it?

4956
03:47:52.079 --> 03:47:53.704
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Okay.

4957
03:47:55.428 --> 03:47:56.653
SAM: Don't know what we'll use it for,

4958
03:47:56.653 --> 03:47:58.432
but it'll be fun.
LAURA: It's going to be amazing.

4959
03:47:58.432 --> 03:47:59.836
MARISHA: It'll present itself. It'll be great.

4960
03:47:59.836 --> 03:48:04.836
MATT: "You have cleared me of my current

4961
03:48:04.936 --> 03:48:07.810
"magical implements,

4962
03:48:07.810 --> 03:48:11.105
"but I do have many other
trinkets and fun things.

4963
03:48:11.105 --> 03:48:12.525
"You in particular were interested

4964
03:48:12.525 --> 03:48:15.309
"in some of my other personal creations?"

4965
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:17.856
TALIESIN: Oh, this is-- I'm very excited
to learn how to play this.

4966
03:48:17.856 --> 03:48:19.140
This is going to be great.

4967
03:48:19.140 --> 03:48:20.481
ASHLEY: Do you have--

4968
03:48:20.481 --> 03:48:23.089
you like making musical instruments, yes?

4969
03:48:23.089 --> 03:48:27.247
MATT: "Oh, well that is one thing
I pass my time with, yes."

4970
03:48:29.065 --> 03:48:30.331
ASHLEY: Do you have a...

4971
03:48:32.185 --> 03:48:33.458
Do you have a harp?

4972
03:48:33.458 --> 03:48:35.903
(Marisha laughing)

4973
03:48:35.903 --> 03:48:37.695
MATT: "I can make one."

4974
03:48:38.594 --> 03:48:40.927
ASHLEY: What can you make it out of?

4975
03:48:40.927 --> 03:48:43.554
MATT: She looks over across the table

4976
03:48:43.554 --> 03:48:45.937
at all the intricately carved bones

4977
03:48:45.937 --> 03:48:47.767
that she has laid out and goes,

4978
03:48:49.009 --> 03:48:50.492
"Out of with that."

4979
03:48:50.492 --> 03:48:53.905
She points to-- there's a large oxen skull

4980
03:48:53.905 --> 03:48:57.803
with a big set of curved horns that loop around

4981
03:48:57.803 --> 03:49:01.745
the back of it, and she
points to one of the large horns

4982
03:49:01.745 --> 03:49:03.295
coming out of the side of the skull.

4983
03:49:03.295 --> 03:49:07.546
ASHLEY: That's actually exactly what
I was hoping you could make it out of.

4984
03:49:07.546 --> 03:49:09.174
SAM: A skull harp?

4985
03:49:09.174 --> 03:49:12.221
MATT: "It may take a couple days,
but I can do it."

4986
03:49:13.479 --> 03:49:14.973
ASHLEY: Well, I guess you're making--

4987
03:49:14.973 --> 03:49:16.457
you're coming back for the bowl, or?

4988
03:49:16.457 --> 03:49:19.094
LAURA: Oh, well, yeah.

4989
03:49:19.094 --> 03:49:20.950
ASHLEY: But we're probably going--

4990
03:49:20.950 --> 03:49:24.172
TALIESIN: I would say put the order in,

4991
03:49:24.172 --> 03:49:26.209
because there's some back and forth

4992
03:49:26.209 --> 03:49:28.405
and we should take a couple days to--

4993
03:49:28.405 --> 03:49:31.467
MATT: "A commission for a creation
like that would run about,

4994
03:49:31.467 --> 03:49:33.755
"friends price, of course,
as friends of Ludinus,

4995
03:49:33.755 --> 03:49:34.946
"I'd say...

4996
03:49:36.572 --> 03:49:37.980
"100 gold pieces."

4997
03:49:40.499 --> 03:49:44.131
LAURA: But if we're buying the
gem-crusted bowl, though.

4998
03:49:44.131 --> 03:49:45.188
ASHLEY: What if I were to give--

4999
03:49:45.188 --> 03:49:49.076
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
(chuckling)

5000
03:49:49.076 --> 03:49:51.271
LIAM: She lives.

5001
03:49:51.271 --> 03:49:52.767
(Matt and Taliesin laughing)

5002
03:49:52.767 --> 03:49:53.994
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

5003
03:49:53.994 --> 03:49:54.892
LAURA: No, she doesn't.

5004
03:49:54.892 --> 03:49:56.798
MATT: Natural one?
LAURA: Yep.

5005
03:49:56.798 --> 03:49:58.895
That's, like, all I'm rolling lately.

5006
03:49:58.895 --> 03:49:59.920
MATT: I know, I'm so sorry.

5007
03:49:59.920 --> 03:50:02.484
LAURA: Like, what is happening with my dice, y'all?

5008
03:50:02.484 --> 03:50:04.837
TRAVIS: Maybe you just need to go down to one set.

5009
03:50:04.837 --> 03:50:08.429
Go back to basics.
LAURA: I'm trying to limit it.

5010
03:50:08.429 --> 03:50:10.150
TRAVIS: No, you're not.
LAURA: Okay, okay, tell you what--

5011
03:50:10.150 --> 03:50:12.025
TRAVIS: You've got whole generations of the families

5012
03:50:12.025 --> 03:50:12.983
of dice over there,

5013
03:50:12.983 --> 03:50:14.158
for fuck's sake.
LAURA: Should I keep this one here,

5014
03:50:14.158 --> 03:50:16.261
or should I just switch--
TRAVIS: There's gerrymandering going on

5015
03:50:16.261 --> 03:50:18.030
in your portion of the table.
TALIESIN: I'm going to take you

5016
03:50:18.030 --> 03:50:19.746
to the oldest church in Los Angeles.

5017
03:50:19.746 --> 03:50:22.271
LAURA: Tonight is a full moon. Maybe after the game--

5018
03:50:22.271 --> 03:50:25.554
ASHLEY: You need to bathe them in the--
LAURA: I will perform a ritual.

5019
03:50:25.554 --> 03:50:28.828
TRAVIS: The house of representatives
building under the desk.

5020
03:50:29.770 --> 03:50:33.878
ASHLEY: What do you charge for adding runes

5021
03:50:33.878 --> 03:50:35.203
or anything like that?

5022
03:50:35.203 --> 03:50:37.108
MATT: "Oh, that's part of the process."

5023
03:50:37.108 --> 03:50:38.147
ASHLEY: That's part of the process.

5024
03:50:38.147 --> 03:50:42.611
MATT: "I don't make creations
without adorning them with art."

5025
03:50:42.611 --> 03:50:46.028
ASHLEY: Do you know what I'm going to do, then?

5026
03:50:47.174 --> 03:50:50.011
I'm going to give you a little bit extra.

5027
03:50:50.011 --> 03:50:53.774
I'm going to give you 125 gold,

5028
03:50:53.774 --> 03:50:55.669
and if there's anything very special

5029
03:50:55.669 --> 03:51:00.669
that you want to add to it,

5030
03:51:00.702 --> 03:51:01.920
I'd be fine with that.

5031
03:51:01.920 --> 03:51:03.315
Any flair that you think of.

5032
03:51:03.315 --> 03:51:06.879
MATT: She takes a very long look over you entirely,

5033
03:51:06.879 --> 03:51:10.770
between your armor, the outfit you're wearing,

5034
03:51:10.770 --> 03:51:13.879
the force of personality you hold

5035
03:51:13.879 --> 03:51:15.900
and the imposing figure that you are,

5036
03:51:15.900 --> 03:51:18.175
and looks back over to the table.

5037
03:51:18.175 --> 03:51:20.175
"I think I can improvise."

5038
03:51:22.766 --> 03:51:23.599
ASHLEY: Okay.

5039
03:51:24.972 --> 03:51:26.889
MATT: She accepts the gold.

5040
03:51:28.287 --> 03:51:30.469
"And you would like to commission this bowl as well?"

5041
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:32.037
LAURA: Uh-huh.

5042
03:51:32.037 --> 03:51:34.708
Anybody want to help me, it would help all of us for sure.

5043
03:51:34.708 --> 03:51:36.158
TALIESIN: I'll throw in a little bit for this.

5044
03:51:36.158 --> 03:51:37.018
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5045
03:51:37.018 --> 03:51:40.564
TALIESIN: This is my favorite person
I've met in the city so far.

5046
03:51:40.564 --> 03:51:42.012
MARISHA: We're just bowl enthusiasts.
MATT: "Thank you!"

5047
03:51:42.012 --> 03:51:44.004
TALIESIN: Thank you.
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

5048
03:51:44.004 --> 03:51:45.467
LAURA: You don't have to help, because--

5049
03:51:45.467 --> 03:51:46.600
TALIESIN: How much do you need?

5050
03:51:46.600 --> 03:51:48.210
MARISHA: Oh, is this like an upfront thing?

5051
03:51:48.210 --> 03:51:49.806
Or like pay when--

5052
03:51:49.806 --> 03:51:51.344
MATT: "I will take half of the payment now

5053
03:51:51.344 --> 03:51:53.512
"and half upon retrieval, just to ensure

5054
03:51:53.512 --> 03:51:55.057
"that you're not pulling my leg.

5055
03:51:55.057 --> 03:51:57.415
"Though you have proven yourselves

5056
03:51:57.415 --> 03:52:00.207
"fair patrons."
LAURA: I'll give her 50 platinum right now.

5057
03:52:00.207 --> 03:52:03.369
MARISHA: I'll give her, oh, that's half.
MATT: "All right."

5058
03:52:03.369 --> 03:52:05.385
TALIESIN: So we'll cover the other half when it's done.

5059
03:52:05.385 --> 03:52:06.332
MARISHA: I'll get the other half.

5060
03:52:06.332 --> 03:52:08.437
LIAM: Hi cow man, thanks, you're my favorite customer.

5061
03:52:08.437 --> 03:52:10.065
(laughter)

5062
03:52:10.065 --> 03:52:11.968
ASHLEY: Hi doggie.

5063
03:52:11.968 --> 03:52:13.936
MATT: "Two days, two days, I should have

5064
03:52:13.936 --> 03:52:15.678
"all of this ready for you."

5065
03:52:15.678 --> 03:52:17.148
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Thank you.

5066
03:52:17.148 --> 03:52:18.142
MATT: "Thank you."
TRAVIS: Just going to have

5067
03:52:18.142 --> 03:52:19.875
orders waiting in all these cities.

5068
03:52:19.875 --> 03:52:22.515
(laughter)

5069
03:52:24.263 --> 03:52:27.938
Got a harp here, got some bracers over here.

5070
03:52:27.938 --> 03:52:29.134
ASHLEY: I'm just going to keep spending money

5071
03:52:29.134 --> 03:52:31.095
and never pick up my items.

5072
03:52:31.095 --> 03:52:32.315
(laughter)

5073
03:52:32.315 --> 03:52:35.206
TALIESIN: Standing orders across the globe.

5074
03:52:35.206 --> 03:52:38.127
MATT: Still waiting for you in Rosohna to pick up.

5075
03:52:38.127 --> 03:52:40.251
MARISHA: It's a cross-campaign pro.

5076
03:52:40.251 --> 03:52:41.928
(laughs)

5077
03:52:41.928 --> 03:52:44.334
MATT: It's been about 10 weeks, which is how long

5078
03:52:44.334 --> 03:52:46.223
the commission was going to take.

5079
03:52:46.223 --> 03:52:47.719
ASHLEY: For the?
MATT: For the bracers.

5080
03:52:47.719 --> 03:52:50.112
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought you were talking about the stealthy--

5081
03:52:50.112 --> 03:52:51.337
I was like, "I think it's been a little bit more time."

5082
03:52:51.337 --> 03:52:53.417
MATT: Oh, the stealth armor? It's almost ready.

5083
03:52:53.417 --> 03:52:55.088
Pike'll pick that up eventually.

5084
03:52:55.088 --> 03:52:57.167
(laughter)

5085
03:52:57.167 --> 03:52:59.232
TALIESIN: Show up, he's like, "I haven't even started."

5086
03:52:59.232 --> 03:53:01.899
(laughter)

5087
03:53:03.446 --> 03:53:04.981
MATT: "Is that all you need from me?"

5088
03:53:04.981 --> 03:53:06.271
SAM: I think so.
TALIESIN: For the moment, yeah.

5089
03:53:06.271 --> 03:53:07.796
We'll be back.

5090
03:53:07.796 --> 03:53:09.326
MATT: "Thank you for coming to my collection.

5091
03:53:09.326 --> 03:53:13.085
"I look forward to seeing you in a few days.

5092
03:53:13.085 --> 03:53:14.436
"Good luck."

5093
03:53:14.436 --> 03:53:17.294
(laughter)
MARISHA: Bye.

5094
03:53:17.294 --> 03:53:20.360
TRAVIS: She did that, but her arms
reached around, touched her ear.

5095
03:53:20.360 --> 03:53:21.531
MATT: Well, a hand was out here.

5096
03:53:21.531 --> 03:53:23.901
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

5097
03:53:23.901 --> 03:53:24.817
MATT: All right.

5098
03:53:24.817 --> 03:53:28.235
And you guys exit back into the alleyway.
MARISHA: Were we supposed to be--

5099
03:53:28.235 --> 03:53:29.768
jade, jade, jade?

5100
03:53:29.768 --> 03:53:30.844
SAM and LAURA: What about jade?

5101
03:53:30.844 --> 03:53:32.116
MARISHA: Are we supposed to be looking for jade?

5102
03:53:32.116 --> 03:53:33.086
LAURA: For what?
SAM: What's jade?

5103
03:53:33.086 --> 03:53:34.301
Whose jade?
MARISHA: Right?

5104
03:53:34.301 --> 03:53:36.209
LAURA: Why would we need jade?

5105
03:53:36.209 --> 03:53:37.668
MARISHA: Keep going, keep going.

5106
03:53:37.668 --> 03:53:38.635
Let me remember something.

5107
03:53:38.635 --> 03:53:40.154
LAURA: (gasps)

5108
03:53:40.154 --> 03:53:41.378
Just one, one.

5109
03:53:41.378 --> 03:53:43.617
MARISHA: Someone wanted us to find something.
TALIESIN: I'm here to provide.

5110
03:53:43.617 --> 03:53:45.879
SAM: All right, if we're going to stick around Rexxentrum

5111
03:53:45.879 --> 03:53:46.712
for two days.

5112
03:53:46.712 --> 03:53:49.028
(dice rattling)

5113
03:53:49.028 --> 03:53:51.119
What do we need to accomplish?

5114
03:53:51.119 --> 03:53:55.744
TALIESIN: We could go check the archive site.

5115
03:53:55.744 --> 03:53:58.133
LAURA: Or we could go to that place if it's--

5116
03:53:58.133 --> 03:53:59.897
oh no, it's far away, isn't it?

5117
03:53:59.897 --> 03:54:00.996
LIAM: What place?

5118
03:54:00.996 --> 03:54:03.504
LAURA: The Pride's Call.

5119
03:54:03.504 --> 03:54:05.697
SAM: Pride Rock?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

5120
03:54:05.697 --> 03:54:07.976
TRAVIS: It is a ways away.

5121
03:54:07.976 --> 03:54:10.559
LAURA: Oh, this is a minty one.

5122
03:54:12.062 --> 03:54:12.895
No, it's not.

5123
03:54:12.895 --> 03:54:15.345
MATT: From Rexxentrum, Pride's Call is roughly

5124
03:54:15.345 --> 03:54:17.032
200 miles away.

5125
03:54:17.032 --> 03:54:17.865
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

5126
03:54:17.865 --> 03:54:21.421
SAM: If only we could get there faster.

5127
03:54:22.649 --> 03:54:25.359
TALIESIN: I still having that conversation

5128
03:54:25.359 --> 03:54:29.869
underneath magical duress is not the craziest idea.

5129
03:54:29.869 --> 03:54:32.931
All the cards on, some cards on the table.

5130
03:54:32.931 --> 03:54:35.419
SAM: I just don't know why he would agree to that.

5131
03:54:35.419 --> 03:54:38.784
We know that he's concealing stuff from us already.

5132
03:54:38.784 --> 03:54:39.915
TALIESIN: We just don't know what he's concealing.

5133
03:54:39.915 --> 03:54:42.554
SAM: I know, so why would he ever agree to that?

5134
03:54:42.554 --> 03:54:44.586
TALIESIN: We would also be under it.

5135
03:54:44.586 --> 03:54:46.669
TRAVIS: Right, but it does convey a certain sense

5136
03:54:46.669 --> 03:54:50.194
of understood distrust, and I don't know

5137
03:54:50.194 --> 03:54:53.347
if that's entirely what we want to do in this position.

5138
03:54:53.347 --> 03:54:55.708
SAM: Why don't we go back to him and say,

5139
03:54:55.708 --> 03:54:56.950
"We don't believe you."

5140
03:54:56.950 --> 03:54:57.989
TRAVIS: Thank you for yesterday.

5141
03:54:57.989 --> 03:55:00.028
Thank you for taking us to your asylum.

5142
03:55:00.028 --> 03:55:01.470
We don't trust you for shit.

5143
03:55:01.470 --> 03:55:05.229
TALIESIN: Well, if they had been a little bit more honest,

5144
03:55:05.229 --> 03:55:06.854
maybe we would've.

5145
03:55:06.854 --> 03:55:09.031
LAURA: Yeah, but they don't know we know that they were not.

5146
03:55:09.031 --> 03:55:10.708
TALIESIN: I think they know.

5147
03:55:10.708 --> 03:55:11.791
LAURA: Do they?

5148
03:55:11.791 --> 03:55:13.747
TALIESIN: I don't know, that's why I want to ask!

5149
03:55:13.747 --> 03:55:14.954
(laughter)

5150
03:55:14.954 --> 03:55:18.828
LIAM: We are very certain they are using us.

5151
03:55:18.828 --> 03:55:21.486
It is obvious.

5152
03:55:21.486 --> 03:55:22.932
I agree with Fjord, I'm not sure what

5153
03:55:22.932 --> 03:55:26.223
going back to these people who are trying to use us,

5154
03:55:26.223 --> 03:55:28.716
and asking them how they're using us, is going to help.

5155
03:55:28.716 --> 03:55:33.682
TALIESIN: I have a unquenchable hope that we can find

5156
03:55:33.682 --> 03:55:35.508
one ally in this mess.

5157
03:55:36.500 --> 03:55:40.257
TRAVIS: That's fair.
TALIESIN: And I don't know any other way to do it.

5158
03:55:40.257 --> 03:55:42.834
TRAVIS: Sure, we have time to kill.

5159
03:55:42.834 --> 03:55:44.253
We could certainly ask in the morning,

5160
03:55:44.253 --> 03:55:46.907
before we had out to Pride's Call.

5161
03:55:46.907 --> 03:55:49.828
SAM: Wasn't there another mission that we were also--

5162
03:55:49.828 --> 03:55:51.760
MARISHA: That's what I'm trying to remember.
And there was something--

5163
03:55:51.760 --> 03:55:55.244
MATT: You were offered a job from Pumat.

5164
03:55:55.244 --> 03:55:57.098
SAM: Oh, that's right.
MARISHA: What did he want us to find?

5165
03:55:57.098 --> 03:56:00.102
MATT: He wanted you to find--
MARISHA: Oh, basilisk oil.

5166
03:56:00.102 --> 03:56:02.633
TRAVIS: Oh, we should've asked Crazy Creepy Fingers

5167
03:56:02.633 --> 03:56:03.852
if she needed anything.

5168
03:56:03.852 --> 03:56:05.808
MARISHA: Basilisk.
LAURA: Go back in and ask her!

5169
03:56:05.808 --> 03:56:06.937
TRAVIS: I walk back in and knock on the--

5170
03:56:06.937 --> 03:56:07.839
LAURA: Tell her where we're going.

5171
03:56:07.839 --> 03:56:09.464
TRAVIS: Hello?

5172
03:56:09.464 --> 03:56:10.647
Keona?

5173
03:56:10.647 --> 03:56:11.578
MARISHA: I knew there was something.

5174
03:56:11.578 --> 03:56:12.616
MATT: "Back so soon?"

5175
03:56:12.616 --> 03:56:13.876
TRAVIS: Yes, so sorry.

5176
03:56:13.876 --> 03:56:16.206
You said you had been wiped clean.

5177
03:56:16.206 --> 03:56:18.721
I know the war effort is placing a high demand

5178
03:56:18.721 --> 03:56:20.156
on your stores.

5179
03:56:20.156 --> 03:56:23.740
Is there anything that you need procured or found

5180
03:56:23.740 --> 03:56:24.937
or sussed out?

5181
03:56:24.937 --> 03:56:27.454
We happen to be very handy.

5182
03:56:29.396 --> 03:56:30.687
MATT: "Hmm.

5183
03:56:31.690 --> 03:56:33.900
"Are you heading anywhere in particular?"

5184
03:56:33.900 --> 03:56:38.900
TRAVIS: We might be heading in a southwestern direction.

5185
03:56:38.979 --> 03:56:41.229
Southwestern, southwestern.

5186
03:56:42.959 --> 03:56:45.499
MATT: "That's extremely vague and not helpful."

5187
03:56:45.499 --> 03:56:48.643
TRAVIS: Yes, towards Pride's Call.

5188
03:56:48.643 --> 03:56:49.701
Out of Rexxentrum.

5189
03:56:49.701 --> 03:56:52.987
MATT: "Could you procure me some Pride silk?"

5190
03:56:52.987 --> 03:56:56.979
TRAVIS: Pride silk, I love Pride silk.

5191
03:56:56.979 --> 03:56:58.625
What is it?

5192
03:56:58.625 --> 03:57:01.375
LAURA: (laughs) "What is it?"

5193
03:57:02.360 --> 03:57:04.201
MATT: "You see,

5194
03:57:04.201 --> 03:57:09.201
"due to the nature of the strange

5195
03:57:10.496 --> 03:57:14.038
"geothermal nature of the mountain range

5196
03:57:14.038 --> 03:57:16.851
"that protrudes on that side of the Valley,

5197
03:57:16.851 --> 03:57:19.153
"some of the plant life and creatures within

5198
03:57:19.153 --> 03:57:21.089
"are a bit different.

5199
03:57:21.089 --> 03:57:26.073
"The silkworms that have come to grow around Pride's Call

5200
03:57:26.073 --> 03:57:30.364
"produce a very strong silk,

5201
03:57:30.364 --> 03:57:31.830
"specific to the region.

5202
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:33.937
"It's one of their greatest exports."

5203
03:57:33.937 --> 03:57:36.228
TRAVIS: Huh.

5204
03:57:36.228 --> 03:57:38.504
Would you be needing the silkworms,

5205
03:57:38.504 --> 03:57:42.870
or would you need us to extract

5206
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:44.397
their silk?

5207
03:57:44.397 --> 03:57:46.275
MATT: "Whichever is easiest for you."

5208
03:57:46.275 --> 03:57:48.123
TRAVIS: I think probably just the worms.

5209
03:57:48.123 --> 03:57:51.223
I never milked a silkworm before.

5210
03:57:52.396 --> 03:57:54.290
ASHLEY: That's actually kind of fun.

5211
03:57:54.290 --> 03:57:56.078
MARISHA: (laughs)

5212
03:57:56.078 --> 03:57:58.335
TALIESIN: That won't work.

5213
03:57:58.335 --> 03:58:01.854
MATT: "Mind you, it's a very, very controlled process.

5214
03:58:01.854 --> 03:58:03.862
"It is very important to Pride's Call.

5215
03:58:03.862 --> 03:58:06.343
"This would not be an easy task."

5216
03:58:06.343 --> 03:58:08.510
TRAVIS: How much would you need?

5217
03:58:09.673 --> 03:58:13.789
MATT: "I mean, if you can procure a worm for me,

5218
03:58:13.789 --> 03:58:15.489
"I'll take three."

5219
03:58:16.868 --> 03:58:18.468
TRAVIS: Three worms?

5220
03:58:19.388 --> 03:58:21.055
MATT: "500 gold a worm."

5221
03:58:21.055 --> 03:58:22.521
MARISHA: Whoa!

5222
03:58:23.474 --> 03:58:25.250
Let's get some worms!

5223
03:58:25.250 --> 03:58:26.456
TRAVIS: Sure.

5224
03:58:26.456 --> 03:58:28.275
We will do our best.

5225
03:58:28.275 --> 03:58:29.275
MATT: "All right."

5226
03:58:30.238 --> 03:58:31.571
TRAVIS: Anything else?

5227
03:58:33.028 --> 03:58:34.750
MATT: "No."

5228
03:58:34.750 --> 03:58:37.334
TRAVIS: How long have you been in Rexxentrum?

5229
03:58:37.334 --> 03:58:38.628
MATT: "Me?"
TRAVIS: Yes.

5230
03:58:38.628 --> 03:58:43.036
MATT: "Oh, maybe 40 years."

5231
03:58:44.141 --> 03:58:46.061
TRAVIS: Family business, is it?

5232
03:58:46.061 --> 03:58:48.177
MATT: "No, just my own.

5233
03:58:49.508 --> 03:58:53.919
"I'm what you would call the odd duck in the family."

5234
03:58:53.919 --> 03:58:55.356
TRAVIS: Can't imagine why.

5235
03:58:55.356 --> 03:58:57.759
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to let Eyes of the Grave

5236
03:58:57.759 --> 03:58:59.499
roll for a second in this room,

5237
03:58:59.499 --> 03:59:00.886
just to give a little peek around.

5238
03:59:00.886 --> 03:59:01.924
MATT: (laughs)

5239
03:59:01.924 --> 03:59:03.645
Nothing registers.

5240
03:59:03.645 --> 03:59:06.569
TALIESIN: I'm relieved and disappointed at the same time.

5241
03:59:06.569 --> 03:59:08.268
MATT: (laughs)

5242
03:59:08.268 --> 03:59:09.976
TRAVIS: Well, I hope when we see you next,

5243
03:59:09.976 --> 03:59:13.471
we come bearing gifts.

5244
03:59:13.471 --> 03:59:15.129
MATT: "I hope so, too."

5245
03:59:16.527 --> 03:59:18.557
TRAVIS: Toodle-oo!

5246
03:59:18.557 --> 03:59:21.669
It is just as creepy the second time.

5247
03:59:21.669 --> 03:59:22.502
MATT: (laughs)

5248
03:59:22.502 --> 03:59:24.431
ASHLEY: She reminds me of home.

5249
03:59:24.431 --> 03:59:25.438
TRAVIS: She what?

5250
03:59:25.438 --> 03:59:27.972
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, right?
TALIESIN: That's weird.

5251
03:59:27.972 --> 03:59:29.765
TRAVIS: What do you mean? In what way?

5252
03:59:29.765 --> 03:59:31.172
SAM: What home? What?

5253
03:59:31.172 --> 03:59:32.021
ASHLEY: I don't know.

5254
03:59:32.021 --> 03:59:33.882
TALIESIN: She's so crafty.
ASHLEY: She seemed crafty.

5255
03:59:33.882 --> 03:59:36.173
TALIESIN: I'm always impressed by
someone who's like, scrapbooking.

5256
03:59:36.173 --> 03:59:38.192
LAURA: Did you know somebody with long fingers?

5257
03:59:38.192 --> 03:59:41.716
ASHLEY: No, just like how she is, and making things,

5258
03:59:41.716 --> 03:59:45.053
and arts and crafts with bones.

5259
03:59:45.053 --> 03:59:46.790
You know?

5260
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:47.912
TALIESIN: You can do a lot.
ASHLEY: It's cool.

5261
03:59:47.912 --> 03:59:51.181
LAURA: I wonder if she's from Xhorhas.

5262
03:59:51.181 --> 03:59:53.940
ASHLEY: Maybe I'll ask her when we come back.

5263
03:59:53.940 --> 03:59:58.190
TRAVIS: If we can acquire three silkworms

5264
03:59:58.190 --> 03:59:59.509
from near Pride's Call,

5265
03:59:59.509 --> 04:00:02.701
she'll give us 500 gold per worm.

5266
04:00:02.701 --> 04:00:04.451
LAURA: Oh, they must be really hard to kill, then.

5267
04:00:04.451 --> 04:00:06.774
MATT: History check for both of you guys.

5268
04:00:06.774 --> 04:00:08.896
TALIESIN: Or they're the size of horses.

5269
04:00:08.896 --> 04:00:10.807
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

5270
04:00:10.807 --> 04:00:11.837
LAURA: No, yeah.

5271
04:00:11.837 --> 04:00:14.530
ASHLEY: I was going to say, they're probably huge.

5272
04:00:14.530 --> 04:00:15.363
TRAVIS: Like a bus.

5273
04:00:15.363 --> 04:00:17.206
LIAM: Natural 20 for a total of 30.

5274
04:00:17.206 --> 04:00:19.081
TRAVIS: (drawn out) Ooh!

5275
04:00:19.081 --> 04:00:20.658
Tell me everything.

5276
04:00:20.658 --> 04:00:21.590
MARISHA: 26.

5277
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:22.818
TALIESIN: Nothing like the shopping episode

5278
04:00:22.818 --> 04:00:26.209
to run natural 20s right there.

5279
04:00:26.209 --> 04:00:28.333
Burn them all now.

5280
04:00:28.333 --> 04:00:33.016
MATT: Pride's silk is the most prominent,

5281
04:00:33.016 --> 04:00:37.485
expensive, and controlled export of Pride's Call.

5282
04:00:37.485 --> 04:00:39.988
Only a handful of families procure it,

5283
04:00:39.988 --> 04:00:41.949
and they guard those silkworms,

5284
04:00:41.949 --> 04:00:43.862
which, by the way, are about the size of a fist,

5285
04:00:45.137 --> 04:00:48.392
like they are the goose that laid the golden egg,

5286
04:00:48.392 --> 04:00:50.070
because in a lot of ways, they are,

5287
04:00:50.070 --> 04:00:53.391
and a lot of people outside that try and take them

5288
04:00:53.391 --> 04:00:54.224
disappear.

5289
04:00:54.224 --> 04:00:56.783
LIAM: So a few families from that region got it on lock.

5290
04:00:56.783 --> 04:00:57.996
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

5291
04:00:57.996 --> 04:01:02.047
MATT: And the theft of taking these

5292
04:01:02.047 --> 04:01:03.709
is very much against the law.

5293
04:01:03.709 --> 04:01:05.323
They are legally owned by these families,

5294
04:01:05.323 --> 04:01:08.483
and there's agreed upon, part of the whole

5295
04:01:08.483 --> 04:01:11.864
Pride's Call coming into the Empire

5296
04:01:11.864 --> 04:01:14.990
was an agreement that they would also give

5297
04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:16.896
a certain amount of this silk to the Empire

5298
04:01:16.896 --> 04:01:19.020
for its own uses, taking a tithe

5299
04:01:19.020 --> 04:01:23.030
of what they're creating, but it is very much,

5300
04:01:23.030 --> 04:01:26.897
you know, like, the banner of the town.

5301
04:01:26.897 --> 04:01:29.468
So if there is an intent to take them,

5302
04:01:29.468 --> 04:01:32.479
it's not going to be easy.

5303
04:01:32.479 --> 04:01:34.062
And definitely not legal.

5304
04:01:34.062 --> 04:01:36.171
TALIESIN: This is stealing horses.

5305
04:01:36.171 --> 04:01:37.480
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: This is like horse theft, okay.

5306
04:01:37.480 --> 04:01:40.594
TRAVIS: Is it the law, or is it more of a suggestion?

5307
04:01:40.594 --> 04:01:42.738
MATT: Very much the law.
TRAVIS: Meh!

5308
04:01:42.738 --> 04:01:44.995
LAURA: (laughs)

5309
04:01:44.995 --> 04:01:46.859
TALIESIN: All right, horse wrangling.

5310
04:01:46.859 --> 04:01:50.372
SAM: I'm not sure why we would need to go to Pride's Call.

5311
04:01:50.372 --> 04:01:54.215
I mean, what are we trying to find there?

5312
04:01:54.215 --> 04:01:57.903
TRAVIS: Well, they said that there was an archeological dig.

5313
04:01:57.903 --> 04:02:00.459
MARISHA: That's where they found the beacon.
SAM: That's fake.

5314
04:02:00.459 --> 04:02:02.409
TRAVIS: Potentially.
MARISHA: I mean, we don't know.

5315
04:02:02.409 --> 04:02:03.897
TALIESIN: Seems like an awful lot of work to prove

5316
04:02:03.897 --> 04:02:06.711
that we already know that they're lying.

5317
04:02:06.711 --> 04:02:09.725
SAM: I want to find your friend Astrid.

5318
04:02:11.183 --> 04:02:13.924
MARISHA: Why?
SAM: Weren't you curious about her?

5319
04:02:15.466 --> 04:02:16.340
LIAM: Maybe.

5320
04:02:16.340 --> 04:02:18.892
LAURA: She did say to meet her.

5321
04:02:18.892 --> 04:02:20.047
SAM: She gave us her address.

5322
04:02:20.047 --> 04:02:23.506
We could at least swing by and see if she's home.

5323
04:02:23.506 --> 04:02:27.404
MARISHA: I mean, that also feels like a trap though, right?

5324
04:02:27.404 --> 04:02:28.725
SAM: No, she doesn't know who we are.

5325
04:02:28.725 --> 04:02:30.833
LAURA: Now Trent already knows we're here,

5326
04:02:30.833 --> 04:02:32.030
it's not like he's going to like,

5327
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:36.182
suddenly surprise us when we get to her house or something.

5328
04:02:36.182 --> 04:02:37.349
TRAVIS: That's true.

5329
04:02:38.867 --> 04:02:40.052
LAURA: Do you want to see her?

5330
04:02:40.052 --> 04:02:43.714
LIAM: I don't want to go over there a big group of us.

5331
04:02:43.714 --> 04:02:46.162
SAM: Well, just a couple, then?

5332
04:02:46.162 --> 04:02:47.291
Just to spy a little bit?

5333
04:02:47.291 --> 04:02:50.765
TRAVIS: Just stay outside, if you wanted to check in.

5334
04:02:50.765 --> 04:02:53.221
LAURA: Just to make sure you're safe.

5335
04:02:53.221 --> 04:02:55.879
SAM: You and I could turn invisible.

5336
04:02:55.879 --> 04:02:56.712
LIAM: No.

5337
04:02:56.712 --> 04:02:59.158
SAM: Just look through the window.

5338
04:02:59.158 --> 04:03:00.739
LIAM: I would rather not.

5339
04:03:00.739 --> 04:03:01.572
LAURA: Okay.

5340
04:03:01.572 --> 04:03:03.354
SAM: You want to send me?

5341
04:03:05.212 --> 04:03:08.678
LIAM: No, I don't want to poke that nest.

5342
04:03:11.252 --> 04:03:13.153
TRAVIS: All right.

5343
04:03:13.153 --> 04:03:16.203
Well, if we're not going to Pride's Call,

5344
04:03:16.203 --> 04:03:19.265
and we need to kill a few days.

5345
04:03:19.265 --> 04:03:21.376
Should we enter a fighting tournament?

5346
04:03:21.376 --> 04:03:24.154
(laughter)

5347
04:03:24.154 --> 04:03:25.326
MATT: Yes!

5348
04:03:25.326 --> 04:03:28.449
(laughter)

5349
04:03:28.449 --> 04:03:29.580
Fuck yes.

5350
04:03:30.572 --> 04:03:33.094
TRAVIS: Does such a thing exist in this town?

5351
04:03:33.094 --> 04:03:35.508
MATT: I can make one.
TRAVIS: Because I feel like,

5352
04:03:35.508 --> 04:03:37.058
suddenly overnight,

5353
04:03:37.058 --> 04:03:38.813
I feel a bit more me.

5354
04:03:38.813 --> 04:03:41.448
I don't know, and perhaps we need to just,

5355
04:03:41.448 --> 04:03:43.707
you know, mix it up.

5356
04:03:45.467 --> 04:03:47.091
Punch me.

5357
04:03:47.091 --> 04:03:49.500
Oh, fuck, no, ah!

5358
04:03:49.500 --> 04:03:50.960
MATT: (laughs)

5359
04:03:50.960 --> 04:03:53.639
MARISHA: I will take any opportunity, any.

5360
04:03:53.639 --> 04:03:54.722
I don't know why.

5361
04:03:54.722 --> 04:03:57.741
TALIESIN: A couple days to maybe burn some spells,

5362
04:03:57.741 --> 04:03:59.047
prepare, see what I can--

5363
04:03:59.047 --> 04:04:01.142
MATT: You guys can take downtime. You don't have to like--

5364
04:04:01.142 --> 04:04:02.178
TALIESIN: Couple days of just downtime

5365
04:04:02.178 --> 04:04:03.677
might just be a good thing to do.

5366
04:04:03.677 --> 04:04:06.004
TRAVIS: I want a fighting tournament.

5367
04:04:06.004 --> 04:04:08.113
LAURA: (laughs)

5368
04:04:08.113 --> 04:04:09.728
MATT: There isn't a public one here.
TRAVIS: Fuck.

5369
04:04:09.728 --> 04:04:11.638
MATT: If you wanted to take some downtime to inquire

5370
04:04:11.638 --> 04:04:13.401
about like any underground fight rings,

5371
04:04:13.401 --> 04:04:14.692
you can definitely take that as part of

5372
04:04:14.692 --> 04:04:16.950
your downtime activity.
MARISHA: Fight club!

5373
04:04:18.875 --> 04:04:20.166
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5374
04:04:20.166 --> 04:04:21.349
MARISHA: I'm into that.
MATT: Okay.

5375
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:23.963
MARISHA: I don't know, okay, totally into fight club,

5376
04:04:23.963 --> 04:04:26.404
but also if we're taking a few days,

5377
04:04:26.404 --> 04:04:28.958
whether we know they're lying out their fucking asses

5378
04:04:28.958 --> 04:04:31.489
or not, right, it still seems like we should

5379
04:04:32.481 --> 04:04:34.801
try to find more information, right?

5380
04:04:34.801 --> 04:04:36.593
Like something?
SAM: Yeah!

5381
04:04:38.381 --> 04:04:40.487
MARISHA: I don't know how or what or why.

5382
04:04:40.487 --> 04:04:42.281
TRAVIS: You could check in on the temple

5383
04:04:42.281 --> 04:04:45.000
and see how the investigation is going?

5384
04:04:45.000 --> 04:04:47.387
MARISHA: I could check back in. I haven't really spent

5385
04:04:47.387 --> 04:04:50.222
any amount of real time with the Cobalt Soul

5386
04:04:50.222 --> 04:04:53.495
here in Rexxentrum, so I could check in with them.

5387
04:04:53.495 --> 04:04:54.328
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

5388
04:04:54.328 --> 04:04:58.831
MARISHA: The Soul is supposed to act
as a checks and balance system

5389
04:04:58.831 --> 04:05:00.506
between the Cerberus Assembly.

5390
04:05:00.506 --> 04:05:04.723
They're supposed to make sure that all of the information

5391
04:05:04.723 --> 04:05:06.689
that they're holding

5392
04:05:08.540 --> 04:05:10.998
doesn't belong as public knowledge.

5393
04:05:12.061 --> 04:05:12.894
But...

5394
04:05:14.114 --> 04:05:15.906
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

5395
04:05:15.906 --> 04:05:17.820
They don't want what the Cerberus Assembly knows

5396
04:05:17.820 --> 04:05:19.016
to be public knowledge?

5397
04:05:19.016 --> 04:05:22.808
MARISHA: No, they, you know, the Cobalt Soul,

5398
04:05:22.808 --> 04:05:25.207
they believe in keeping knowledge and having like

5399
04:05:25.207 --> 04:05:29.474
a public access to knowledge, and often that

5400
04:05:29.474 --> 04:05:32.265
the hoarding of knowledge

5401
04:05:32.265 --> 04:05:35.044
can be deemed as dangerous.

5402
04:05:35.044 --> 04:05:36.219
So, right?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5403
04:05:36.219 --> 04:05:40.593
TRAVIS: Do you know if the Cobalt Soul has ever interfered

5404
04:05:40.593 --> 04:05:43.960
at a high level with the Cerberus Assembly?

5405
04:05:44.827 --> 04:05:47.397
MARISHA: Do I know if the (mumbling)?

5406
04:05:47.397 --> 04:05:48.504
I feel like--

5407
04:05:48.504 --> 04:05:49.756
MATT: Roll a history check.

5408
04:05:49.756 --> 04:05:52.948
MARISHA: Dairon has mentioned something like this to me.

5409
04:05:52.948 --> 04:05:55.761
MATT: Dairon has, just roll a history check.

5410
04:05:55.761 --> 04:05:57.498
SAM: Also, just a side note.

5411
04:05:57.498 --> 04:06:00.657
If we're honestly just wasting two days,

5412
04:06:00.657 --> 04:06:03.479
why don't we just go to the Bright Queen now,

5413
04:06:03.479 --> 04:06:05.280
and then come back in two days?

5414
04:06:05.280 --> 04:06:07.547
MARISHA: Natural 20.
TALIESIN: We may not be able to come back in two days.

5415
04:06:07.547 --> 04:06:09.680
SAM: Why not? We can teleport whenever we want.

5416
04:06:09.680 --> 04:06:11.122
TALIESIN: Because things may happen there.

5417
04:06:11.122 --> 04:06:12.350
MARISHA: I'm assuming that, right.

5418
04:06:12.350 --> 04:06:13.405
The little moon?

5419
04:06:13.405 --> 04:06:14.854
The moon is a symbol?

5420
04:06:14.854 --> 04:06:17.200
MATT: Often.

5421
04:06:17.200 --> 04:06:19.686
The Cobalt Soul and the Cerberus Assembly

5422
04:06:19.686 --> 04:06:24.595
have worked in an antagonistic lockstep

5423
04:06:24.595 --> 04:06:26.892
for the better part of a century,

5424
04:06:26.892 --> 04:06:30.127
or really since the inception of the Cerberus Assembly.

5425
04:06:30.127 --> 04:06:35.127
They do not outwardly show aggression towards each other,

5426
04:06:35.908 --> 04:06:39.273
but it's very much a political chess game,

5427
04:06:39.273 --> 04:06:42.145
and as such, very much have maintained a checks and balances

5428
04:06:42.145 --> 04:06:43.344
in each point.

5429
04:06:43.344 --> 04:06:47.175
They have done, on both sides, what they can

5430
04:06:47.175 --> 04:06:51.341
to curb the influence

5431
04:06:51.341 --> 04:06:54.188
the other has when it's inconvenient,

5432
04:06:54.188 --> 04:06:57.421
and prevented one or the other

5433
04:06:57.421 --> 04:06:59.712
from achieving internal goals

5434
04:06:59.712 --> 04:07:04.712
that went against the needs and wants of their own faction.

5435
04:07:05.177 --> 04:07:09.115
They do work together out of necessity, publicly,

5436
04:07:09.115 --> 04:07:11.990
and behind the scenes.

5437
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:13.981
It's very much a

5438
04:07:16.381 --> 04:07:19.989
relationship of frustrated

5439
04:07:21.431 --> 04:07:23.106
convenience

5440
04:07:23.106 --> 04:07:26.781
at times, and other times very much a

5441
04:07:28.105 --> 04:07:30.063
subversive antagonism.

5442
04:07:32.147 --> 04:07:33.370
MARISHA: I relay all of that.

5443
04:07:33.370 --> 04:07:35.744
TRAVIS: Some complicated shit.

5444
04:07:35.744 --> 04:07:38.460
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, the thing that first started

5445
04:07:38.460 --> 04:07:40.699
getting me on board with the Cobalt Soul

5446
04:07:40.699 --> 04:07:43.648
was when they were like, "Yeah, we root out corruption

5447
04:07:43.648 --> 04:07:46.511
"in places like the government and Cerberus Assembly,"

5448
04:07:46.511 --> 04:07:48.825
and then I was like, "Whoa, but aren't you,

5449
04:07:48.825 --> 04:07:51.905
"like, an organization, and aren't all organizations

5450
04:07:51.905 --> 04:07:53.177
"prone to, like, corruption?"

5451
04:07:53.177 --> 04:07:54.527
And they were like--
MATT: You rolled a natural 20, correct?

5452
04:07:54.527 --> 04:07:55.644
MARISHA: Yes.

5453
04:07:55.644 --> 04:07:58.870
MATT: You do know, a recent historical event

5454
04:07:58.870 --> 04:08:01.314
in which the Cobalt Soul was responsible

5455
04:08:01.314 --> 04:08:04.245
for rooting out illegal, magical experimentations

5456
04:08:04.245 --> 04:08:07.453
that a member of the Cerberus Assembly was accomplishing

5457
04:08:07.453 --> 04:08:11.328
about 25, 26 years ago,

5458
04:08:11.328 --> 04:08:13.325
by the name of Dr. Anna Ripley,

5459
04:08:13.325 --> 04:08:15.447
who was then ousted from the Assembly

5460
04:08:15.447 --> 04:08:17.656
and escaped punishment.

5461
04:08:19.044 --> 04:08:20.476
SAM: Ooh.

5462
04:08:20.476 --> 04:08:21.884
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

5463
04:08:23.842 --> 04:08:24.806
Okay.

5464
04:08:24.806 --> 04:08:27.489
LAURA: Anna Ripley was in the Assembly?

5465
04:08:27.489 --> 04:08:28.739
SAM: Whoa.

5466
04:08:28.739 --> 04:08:29.898
MATT: My apologies.

5467
04:08:29.898 --> 04:08:30.839
Delilah Briarwood.

5468
04:08:30.839 --> 04:08:32.151
LAURA: (gasps)
SAM: Oh.

5469
04:08:32.151 --> 04:08:34.547
LAURA: Delilah Briarwood!

5470
04:08:34.547 --> 04:08:36.047
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Was in the Assembly?

5471
04:08:36.047 --> 04:08:37.681
LIAM: Yeah, that's been mentioned at this table before.

5472
04:08:37.681 --> 04:08:38.833
MATT: Yeah.

5473
04:08:40.492 --> 04:08:41.806
Working on the animated series right now.

5474
04:08:41.806 --> 04:08:44.746
My brain crossed paths on that one.

5475
04:08:44.746 --> 04:08:47.967
Delilah Briarwood was a member of the Assembly.

5476
04:08:47.967 --> 04:08:51.092
And it was the Cobalt Soul that uncovered

5477
04:08:51.092 --> 04:08:55.268
her necromantic experimentation.

5478
04:08:56.346 --> 04:08:57.604
MARISHA: Right.

5479
04:08:58.650 --> 04:09:02.086
Yeah, this like weird fucking vampirey woman, I don't know.

5480
04:09:02.086 --> 04:09:03.649
TRAVIS: Cool.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5481
04:09:03.649 --> 04:09:04.900
TRAVIS: All right.

5482
04:09:04.900 --> 04:09:06.999
You were saying about a two day wait?

5483
04:09:06.999 --> 04:09:09.070
SAM: No, I'm fine to just wait two days,

5484
04:09:09.070 --> 04:09:10.945
but if we're not going to do anything,

5485
04:09:10.945 --> 04:09:14.243
why don't we just go to talk to the Bright Queen now,

5486
04:09:14.243 --> 04:09:15.234
and come back?

5487
04:09:15.234 --> 04:09:16.163
LIAM: Well, I'll tell you why.

5488
04:09:16.163 --> 04:09:19.199
Because we need to be here for two days

5489
04:09:19.199 --> 04:09:23.054
so that I can split off on my own and go to,

5490
04:09:23.054 --> 04:09:26.378
without telling any of you, 31st Wodestone Manor.

5491
04:09:27.354 --> 04:09:28.709
SAM: Got it.

5492
04:09:28.709 --> 04:09:32.581
TALIESIN: I also want to cast Commune every day for--

5493
04:09:32.581 --> 04:09:34.123
I have a few questions, so.
MATT: Okay.

5494
04:09:34.123 --> 04:09:35.916
Well, hold onto those thoughts.

5495
04:09:35.916 --> 04:09:37.259
LAURA: Oh.

5496
04:09:37.259 --> 04:09:39.625
MATT: Because it is 11:00.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5497
04:09:39.625 --> 04:09:41.561
MATT: And we'll take a week to gather your thoughts

5498
04:09:41.561 --> 04:09:42.923
on the things you want to achieve

5499
04:09:42.923 --> 04:09:44.817
when we come back next Thursday.

5500
04:09:44.817 --> 04:09:46.428
MARISHA: Fuck!

5501
04:09:46.428 --> 04:09:48.661
TRAVIS: Please train me to be a badass fighter

5502
04:09:48.661 --> 04:09:50.815
in underground basement clubs.

5503
04:09:50.815 --> 04:09:53.772
MATT: Sorry about the mix-up there about

5504
04:09:53.772 --> 04:09:56.447
the Ripley-Delilah thing.
MARISHA: No, no, no, that's fine.

5505
04:09:56.447 --> 04:09:57.466
That's awesome.

5506
04:09:57.466 --> 04:10:00.981
MATT: But, go ahead and make notes there.

5507
04:10:00.981 --> 04:10:02.779
We'll pick up next week, and see how you guys

5508
04:10:02.779 --> 04:10:05.123
spend your preparation downtime, or however you'd

5509
04:10:05.123 --> 04:10:07.728
want to spend it, next Thursday,

5510
04:10:07.728 --> 04:10:10.178
before we head off to the holidays.

5511
04:10:10.178 --> 04:10:11.011
(chuckles)

5512
04:10:11.011 --> 04:10:15.625
Well, Anna Ripley was part of, did work with the government.

5513
04:10:15.625 --> 04:10:16.970
Which is where my confusion came from.

5514
04:10:16.970 --> 04:10:20.900
She worked with the Dwendalian Empire

5515
04:10:20.900 --> 04:10:25.075
and was ousted for illegal experimentation.

5516
04:10:26.098 --> 04:10:27.201
SAM: Whoa.

5517
04:10:27.201 --> 04:10:30.240
MATT: They met in Port Damali after both

5518
04:10:30.240 --> 04:10:32.752
escaping their own, like, at separate times--

5519
04:10:32.752 --> 04:10:34.109
TRAVIS: Delilah and Anna Ripley did?

5520
04:10:34.109 --> 04:10:34.942
MATT: Yeah.

5521
04:10:34.942 --> 04:10:37.533
TALIESIN: Anna had her own knock off list, too.

5522
04:10:37.533 --> 04:10:38.560
MATT: Yep.

5523
04:10:38.560 --> 04:10:39.498
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

5524
04:10:39.498 --> 04:10:41.045
MATT: King Dwendal was on her list.

5525
04:10:41.045 --> 04:10:43.295
LAURA: That's right, that's right, I remember that.

5526
04:10:45.278 --> 04:10:46.870
TRAVIS: 11:00 things.

5527
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:48.855
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5528
04:10:48.855 --> 04:10:50.552
So yeah, so, yeah.

5529
04:10:50.552 --> 04:10:52.775
That's how they met in Port Damali and aligned themselves,

5530
04:10:52.775 --> 04:10:56.554
they were like, "Fuck the Empire, fuck these people,

5531
04:10:56.554 --> 04:10:58.066
"we got skills, let's work together."

5532
04:10:58.066 --> 04:10:59.869
TALIESIN: Suddenly, I like the Empire a little bit more,

5533
04:10:59.869 --> 04:11:01.117
but only a little.

5534
04:11:01.117 --> 04:11:02.666
(laughter)

5535
04:11:02.666 --> 04:11:04.234
Only a little.

5536
04:11:04.234 --> 04:11:05.067
MATT: Well, cool.

5537
04:11:05.067 --> 04:11:07.390
Thank you guys so much, good game.

5538
04:11:08.539 --> 04:11:09.894
We'll pick up from there next week.

5539
04:11:09.894 --> 04:11:11.220
Thank you guys for coming along with us

5540
04:11:11.220 --> 04:11:12.434
on this leg of the adventure.

5541
04:11:12.434 --> 04:11:14.665
We'll see you next week.

5542
04:11:14.665 --> 04:11:18.111
Don't forget, we love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

5543
04:11:18.111 --> 04:11:18.944
Good night.

5544
04:11:18.944 --> 04:11:20.120
(cheering)

5545
04:11:20.120 --> 04:11:22.870
(dramatic music)

00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:00.952
MATT: Hello everyone,

00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:02.584
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.584 --> 00:00:04.046
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:05.810
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.022
ALL: (hollering discordantly) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:11.480
MATT: Like that.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.110
Before we get into our session tonight,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.374
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:17.034
beginning with the first of our two sponsors this evening,

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:18.751
Hit Point Press! Sam.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.478
SAM: What's up, BTS fans? That's right.

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:24.812
Sam Riegel, number one Army at the table,

00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:27.671
here to drop that Bangtan Bomb on you!

00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:31.805
Let's get #BTSCR trending!

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:35.459
MATT: Sam, I said
Hit Point Press, not BTS.

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:36.956
SAM: I know, Matt, and I don't care.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:39.241
See, when you're an OG Army like me,

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.490
BTS is all you can think of erryday.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.008
My bias is OT7, but I love them all.

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.398
You got RM, you got Jin, you got Suga AKA Agust D,

00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:51.373
J-Hope, Jimin, Vee, and the Golden Maknae, Jungkook.

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:55.808
J-Hope, Jimin, Vee, and the Golden Maknae, Jungkook.

00:00:55.808 --> 00:00:56.641
MATT: I, uh.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.167
I don't doubt your devotion to
the popular K-pop band, BTS, Sam,

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.385
but you're supposed to talk about Hit Point Press,

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:08.281
our sponsor for tonight, and their latest campaign setting,

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:11.650
known as Heckna, and how it's live on Kickstarter.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.521
That's the purpose of this. Heckna's inspired by 80's movies

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:17.231
and cosmic horror,

00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:20.581
and this new carnival setting called Revelia,

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.238
where the carnival's overseen by the ring leader, Heckna.

00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:25.763
It's all about frightening
and delighting the carnival goers.

00:01:25.763 --> 00:01:27.099
SAM: Frightening and delighting fans,

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.348
that sounds like seven boys who shine through the city

00:01:29.348 --> 00:01:30.597
with a little funk and soul

00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:32.300
and light it up like dynamite!

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.632
I'm talking about my
Bulletproof Boy Scouts, woo woo!

00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:39.417
MATT: No, no, it's not BTS,

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:42.725
it's our sponsors,
Hit Point Press, actually.

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:45.522
They wanted you to know everything you need to get started

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.667
in Revelia is included:

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.965
stat blocks for new creatures, magical items.

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:53.285
All tiers come with a deluxe print and PDF,

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:54.483
it's actually really cool.

00:01:54.483 --> 00:01:57.146
The book and box set are 20% off right now

00:01:57.146 --> 00:02:00.221
at bit.ly/crheckna,

00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:02.179
and thank you so much for your support.

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.458
SAM: And remember what
Hit Point Press always says:

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:08.221
The reason we shine is because you give us the light.

00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:10.486
MATT: Sam, does Hit Point Press actually--

00:02:10.486 --> 00:02:13.979
SAM: No, Matt, that was a quote from Jungkook from BTS!

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.392
I know I'm a couple days late,

00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:18.916
but happy 23rd birthday, Jungkook! I purple you!

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:22.160
#BTSCR forever. Back to you, Matt.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.127
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:02:23.127 --> 00:02:26.210
MATT: Okay, thanks, Sam--
LAURA: Is that why your hair is that color?

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.658
Did you do it lighter because of that?
SAM: Maybe.

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:30.996
Because I'm a huge BTS fan,

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:32.877
and not because I just wanted an excuse

00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:36.219
for Matt to read the ad for me.
TRAVIS: I don't even know

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.950
half of what you said.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.605
SAM: I promise you that the Army is going to get online

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:43.427
and make that hashtag shine.

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:48.192
LAURA: No, but seriously, Dynamite is a really good song.

00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:49.276
MATT: BTS is actually really good.

00:02:49.276 --> 00:02:52.860
Anyway, thank you, Hit Point Press. Hit Point Press.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.797
MARISHA: Is that what you were listening to whenever--

00:02:55.797 --> 00:02:58.785
SAM: I was rocking out to it
in the car when Marisha pulled up.

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:00.579
MARISHA: I rolled down my window,
and I was like, "Yeah!"

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.926
MATT: He's good at irony, mostly.

00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:04.991
MARISHA: Yeah, it was great.
MATT: Not so much with him.

00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:06.464
So anyway, our second sponsor tonight,

00:03:06.464 --> 00:03:08.274
our friends since the beginning of the Campaign 2,

00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:09.264
D&amp;D Beyond.

00:03:09.264 --> 00:03:11.490
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.081

We have a few more announcements to get through.

00:03:37.854 --> 00:03:41.248
The first up I have after that is for Brian,

00:03:41.248 --> 00:03:43.069
Brian, for Brian.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.996
BRIAN: Yes.

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:44.829
ASHLEY: Whoa.
SAM: What?

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.895
BRIAN: Pardon me, you beautiful yet dangerous woman,

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:51.062
while I make this announcement.

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:52.089
TRAVIS: Look at that hair.

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:53.756
BRIAN: Thank you, Travis.

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:58.107
It's true, what many of you have heard,

00:03:58.107 --> 00:03:59.778
especially from Marisha.

00:03:59.778 --> 00:04:00.664
ASHLEY: Come in a little more.

00:04:00.664 --> 00:04:04.414
BRIAN: Critical Role's flagship show is coming back.

00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:05.380
ASHLEY: "Flagship show."

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.571
BRIAN: It says it right here!

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.693
Critical Role's flagship show, it says right here,

00:04:10.693 --> 00:04:15.111
is coming back to the internet this Tuesday.

00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:16.256
ASHLEY: To the internet?

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.794
BRIAN: It's Talks Machina, it's back this Tuesday.

00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:20.963
The internet is where it's always been.

00:04:20.963 --> 00:04:23.394
And it's going to air every other week.

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:27.644
It's a new format, it's going to air every other week,

00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:30.872
it's going to be pre-recorded,

00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:32.801
and we're going to be discussing events that have happened

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:36.196
all the way from when you guys came back from the hiatus

00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:40.840
all the way up until this very moment and this very episode.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.203
TRAVIS: Sell me a jet ski or something.

00:04:42.203 --> 00:04:44.406
BRIAN: That you're watching right now, what?

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:46.175
LIAM: Sell you something off the back of a motorboat?

00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:47.772
LAURA: What's that kid from Stranger Things

00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:49.186
with the really big hair?

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:51.448
TRAVIS: Really dope hair?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:52.782
BRIAN: Yeah, he wishes

00:04:52.782 --> 00:04:55.994
it's still going to be this thick when he's 46, like me.

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:59.385
MATT: Kind of reminded me of the
Bill Paxton character in True Lies

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:01.364
that Arnold just decks out.

00:05:01.364 --> 00:05:03.094
ASHLEY: Oh, yes!

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.792
BRIAN: I do pee myself when I'm scared.

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:07.897
MATT: That's what it was, that's what it was.

00:05:07.897 --> 00:05:10.525
BRIAN: Hey gang, but also,
there's more info here for me to--

00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.417
(laughter)

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:16.500
Because we're going to be taping Talks Machina

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.218
before anyone has seen, even you,

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:21.105
the episodes of Critical Role,

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:24.221
the questions are going to be from Dani and myself

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:26.447
and our production team,

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:29.180
but we will still have our fan art and cosplay.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.211
Join us this Tuesday, September 15th,

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.436
I know I'm killing it.

00:05:38.436 --> 00:05:40.343
On Thursday, she's looking at me

00:05:40.343 --> 00:05:41.720
like this is the most amazing thing

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.008
she's ever seen, I like it.

00:05:44.008 --> 00:05:48.544
Or catch the VOD on YouTube on Thursday, September 17th.

And on the Critical Role Podcast Network.

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.459
It's also the flagship show for the podcast network,

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.778
one week later. That's my time.

00:05:55.778 --> 00:05:56.787
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:05:56.787 --> 00:05:59.288
(cheering)

00:05:59.288 --> 00:06:01.289
LIAM: He's back, he's back!

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.710
MARISHA: He's back, oh no!
ASHLEY: Flagship show.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.903
TRAVIS: Don't worry, Laura looks at me like that

00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:08.194
when I get that close to her, too.

00:06:08.194 --> 00:06:09.512
LAURA: Bye, cabbage man.
MATT: Thank you.

00:06:09.512 --> 00:06:11.293
MARISHA: Get back in your cage now, Brian, thank you.

00:06:11.293 --> 00:06:12.935
BRIAN: Bye, love you!

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.146
TRAVIS: Just lock yourself in, it's okay.

00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:16.850
MATT: Thank you, Brian, and I believe--

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.931
BRIAN: Thank you, Matt!

00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:19.689
MATT: Oh, aw.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.713
Laura, I believe you have some things to talk about, too.

00:06:22.713 --> 00:06:24.088
LAURA: I did, I did!

00:06:24.088 --> 00:06:28.063
So our friends at Wyrmwood, dun dun dun,

00:06:28.063 --> 00:06:31.204
have a Critical Role dice vault,

00:06:31.204 --> 00:06:35.148
and a Critical Role tabletop vault now available,

00:06:35.148 --> 00:06:36.066
and I'm going to show them to you.

00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:38.655
SAM: Wait, really?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:42.198
They have it in cherry wood, ooh,

00:06:42.198 --> 00:06:43.924
with the CR engraving on it.

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:44.759
SAM: Cool!

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.205
LAURA: Or in-- am I saying this right?

00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:50.938
In Bavarian, nope, Bolivian rosewood.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.145
TRAVIS: Bavarian, yep.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.732
LAURA: Ooh, with a brass CR engraving.

00:06:55.732 --> 00:06:57.160
I'm going to hold up--
TRAVIS: You have to smell it.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.308
LAURA: I'm going to hold up the vault, though,

00:06:58.308 --> 00:07:00.446
because you can see it better on the vault.

00:07:00.446 --> 00:07:02.198
(clamoring)

00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:03.905
SAM: Smell it, yes.

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:06.464
LAURA: It smells like wood.

00:07:06.464 --> 00:07:11.464
Mm, so yeah, check it out, it's on their website,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.744

00:07:15.744 --> 00:07:16.913
MARISHA: Huzzah.
LAURA: Huzzah.

00:07:16.913 --> 00:07:17.885
TRAVIS: That's really slick.

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:21.059
LAURA: Yeah, and then, in addition to that,

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:24.888

so check it out.
MARISHA: Yes.

00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:30.284
TRAVIS: So dope.

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:32.224
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:34.116
MATT: Thank you, Laura.
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:38.060
MATT: All righty, I believe with that said,
our announcements are finished.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.562
Let's go ahead and jump into

00:07:39.562 --> 00:07:42.763

MATT: And welcome back.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.955
So, last we left off:

00:09:26.955 --> 00:09:29.728
The Mighty Nein had done their preparation

00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:31.789
for the coming event of Traveler Con.

00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:32.689
LAURA: So much preparation.

00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:34.346
MATT: So much preparation.
ASHLEY: So much prep.

00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:36.512
MATT: With the help of the remaining villagers of Vo,

00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:37.478
that decided to stay behind

00:09:37.478 --> 00:09:40.352
and keep the island to themselves.

00:09:40.352 --> 00:09:42.085
You managed to create an entirely inspiring event

00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:46.323
You managed to create an entirely inspiring event

00:09:46.323 --> 00:09:49.165
for the visiting Traveler worshipers,

00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:50.644
that included all manner of things,

00:09:50.644 --> 00:09:53.684
like the gracious dick hunt,

00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:58.584
a glorious performance on stage by our wonderful Yasha,

00:09:58.584 --> 00:10:01.810
and other performers, but mainly just Yasha.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.463
There was a fight ring, apparently.

00:10:05.463 --> 00:10:07.377
The golden dick was found

00:10:07.377 --> 00:10:09.909
and permanently affixed to the hand of Celia.

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:13.467
LIAM: Yeah, permanently.
ASHLEY: ♪ I've got a golden dick-et. ♪

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:18.143
MATT: And culminated with a climb
towards the cusp of Rumblecusp.

00:10:18.143 --> 00:10:20.007
Looking down into the caldera of the volcano,

00:10:20.007 --> 00:10:23.140
there it was revealed that the Traveler was,

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.415
technically not, but really actually is still the Traveler,

00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:28.042
but told them that he was the Moon Weaver

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:29.684
and took the form of the Moon Weaver,

00:10:29.684 --> 00:10:31.980
and apparently drew the wrath of the Moon Weaver,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.740
and in a harsh lesson to bring him down a peg,

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.785
the people were disillusioned by the Traveler,

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:41.360
but nevertheless, seemingly brought somewhat

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.430
into the graces of Sehanine herself,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.549
and it seemed to be a success.

00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:49.346
After which, you said your goodbyes,

00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:53.796
you helped take the ships that were within

00:10:53.796 --> 00:10:55.494
the confines of the Heaven Falls

00:10:55.494 --> 00:10:57.074
outside, for those who needed to do them,

00:10:57.074 --> 00:10:59.982
to take them, to retrieve, and go back home with,

00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:01.294
and you gave the Eden's Horizon

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:05.371
to the remaining crew of the now sunken Balleater,

00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:09.671
and renamed it into-- is it-- Nein Heroez.

00:11:12.622 --> 00:11:14.763
Afterward, you went ahead and made your way to Nicodranas,

00:11:14.763 --> 00:11:15.751
but Ashley, you said there was something

00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:18.059
you wanted to do before you guys--
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:19.242
MATT: We forgot last time.

00:11:19.242 --> 00:11:23.266
ASHLEY: I would love to get a tattoo

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.771
before Orly leaves.

00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:26.896
MATT: Oh right, because you don't have one.

00:11:26.896 --> 00:11:28.845
ASHLEY: No.
MATT: Right, okay.

00:11:28.845 --> 00:11:31.064
So before you left for Nicodranas.

00:11:31.064 --> 00:11:32.229
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:33.691
MATT: Stopping Orly for a brief bit,

00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:37.782
he excitedly comes to you as you approach, he's like,

00:11:37.782 --> 00:11:42.122
"Mm, how can I help you?"

00:11:42.122 --> 00:11:45.830
ASHLEY: I was wondering if I could get a tattoo,

00:11:47.194 --> 00:11:50.459
maybe something that would start here

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.495
and then sort of make its way down my arm.

00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:57.962
MATT: "Mm-hm, that can definitely be done."

00:11:57.962 --> 00:11:58.795
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:02.678
MATT: "What sort of i-m-m-mage are you thinking?"

00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:04.886
MATT: "What sort of i-m-m-mage are you thinking?"

00:12:04.886 --> 00:12:06.707
ASHLEY: I'm thinking...

00:12:08.113 --> 00:12:09.779
I'm thinking...

00:12:13.063 --> 00:12:17.518
Runes. I'm thinking I would like to spell out in runes

00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:19.783
Orphan Maker.

00:12:19.783 --> 00:12:22.833
MATT: "Mm, very well.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.709
"Now what

00:12:26.743 --> 00:12:31.743
"m-m-material are you looking

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:34.784
to imbue?"

00:12:37.972 --> 00:12:41.631
ASHLEY: Maybe, like, a emerald?

00:12:42.865 --> 00:12:47.087
MATT: "Well, if you got the dust, you gonna let me know."

00:12:47.087 --> 00:12:49.657
Do you guys have enough emeralds for this?

00:12:49.657 --> 00:12:51.773
SAM: What does emerald do?
ASHLEY: Because I think emerald is--

00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:53.351
MATT: Emerald is the bonus to dexterity.

00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:54.184
ASHLEY: Yes, okay.

00:12:54.184 --> 00:12:55.595
LAURA: Hold on, let me look, let me look.

00:12:55.595 --> 00:12:56.697
TRAVIS: That's-- you're an odd?

00:12:56.697 --> 00:12:59.061
LAURA: Oh, we got a big emerald.

00:12:59.061 --> 00:12:59.978
SAM: Oh, we got that big emerald from--

00:12:59.978 --> 00:13:01.105
LAURA: We got that big emerald.

00:13:01.105 --> 00:13:02.414
ASHLEY: We can't use that.

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:04.010
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.179
LAURA: We got a bag-o-gems worth a lot of money

00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:08.844
that I can dig out a bunch of emeralds from.

00:13:08.844 --> 00:13:10.843
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, do you know how much--

00:13:10.843 --> 00:13:12.969
Did I tell you how much the larger emerald was worth?

00:13:12.969 --> 00:13:15.442
LAURA: The large emerald you said was worth 250 gold.

00:13:15.442 --> 00:13:16.284
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:13:16.284 --> 00:13:18.450
LAURA: And then the bag of gems,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.247
I think the total worth, now,

00:13:22.247 --> 00:13:24.785
is around 2,000.

00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:27.619
MATT: Mm-hmm.
SAM: How much emerald does she need?

00:13:27.619 --> 00:13:28.494
ASHLEY: How much do you--

00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:29.763
MATT: 2,200 gold worth.

00:13:29.763 --> 00:13:33.571
SAM: Ooh, of pure emerald. Oh boy.

00:13:33.571 --> 00:13:36.337
LAURA: I bet we have some more.
SAM: Let me look.

00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:40.178
MARISHA: Can the wizard do some sort of transmute-y thingy?

00:13:40.178 --> 00:13:42.338
LAURA: Can you turn some of the gems into emeralds?

00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:43.524
TRAVIS: Yeah, make us emerald rich!

00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:47.464
SAM: Wait, I've got residuum. Does that help?

00:13:47.464 --> 00:13:50.901
MATT: Residuum could take the place of some of that, yeah.

00:13:50.901 --> 00:13:52.209
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:13:53.952 --> 00:13:55.178
LAURA: How much emerald dust

00:13:55.178 --> 00:13:57.904
would you say we can make from our bag-o-gems

00:13:57.904 --> 00:13:58.996
and the big emerald?

00:13:58.996 --> 00:14:01.937
MATT: I'll say, with the bag...

00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:05.822
LAURA: Like 1,500?

00:14:06.856 --> 00:14:10.170
MATT: I'd say a little over half,
so like 1,200 from the bag,

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.003
and then you have the other ruby,

00:14:11.003 --> 00:14:14.436
so 1,450 between the two of those, so you're--

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:17.641
need about 750.

00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:21.316
SAM: I have 700 gold of residuum.
MARISHA: Shit.

00:14:22.411 --> 00:14:25.382
TRAVIS: So we're only 1,200.
MARISHA: 50 gold away.

00:14:25.382 --> 00:14:26.583
LAURA: No, we're only 50 gold away.

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:29.460
MATT: 50 gold away from the amount.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.082
SAM: Does anyone have an emerald?

00:14:31.082 --> 00:14:33.311
TALIESIN: I have some residuum you gave me.

00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:35.565
SAM: Oh, you never used it.
LAURA: Oh yeah, we didn't use our residuum.

00:14:35.565 --> 00:14:36.507
SAM: I gave you a hundred, I think--

00:14:36.507 --> 00:14:37.468
TALIESIN: Yeah, you did.
SAM: -- and I kept the other seven.

00:14:37.468 --> 00:14:39.527
ASHLEY: Using all of this for my tattoo.

00:14:39.527 --> 00:14:40.426
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on!

00:14:40.426 --> 00:14:42.563
MARISHA: Dude, this shit is worth it.

00:14:42.563 --> 00:14:44.595
TRAVIS: We are all going to the parlor with you, yes.

00:14:44.595 --> 00:14:47.612
SAM: Is it a bad-- just-- (Veth voice) I love you.

00:14:47.612 --> 00:14:49.500
Is it a bad idea give away this residuum,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.646
like if we need it for reviving someone or something?

00:14:53.646 --> 00:14:54.862
TRAVIS: That's what diamonds are for, right?

00:14:54.862 --> 00:14:55.830
SAM: Sure, sure.
LAURA: Well, yeah.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.996
SAM: But, you know, if we run out of diamonds.

00:14:57.996 --> 00:14:58.829
ASHLEY: Then you have the--

00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:00.843
TALIESIN: We'll have to buy some
more diamonds at some point.

00:15:00.843 --> 00:15:02.496
LAURA: We'll buy some stuff in Nicodranas.

00:15:02.496 --> 00:15:05.284
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah, it's fine, right?

00:15:05.284 --> 00:15:07.779
MARISHA: Get a tattoo!

00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:10.287
ASHLEY: Yeah, but isn't residuum very hard to come by?

00:15:10.287 --> 00:15:11.644
SAM: I don't know, we just found it in a bag.

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:12.536
TRAVIS: I'm sure you could just

00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:14.487
pull it out of the earth somewhere, yeah.

00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:17.264
It's a mineral, like anything else.

00:15:17.264 --> 00:15:19.741
TALIESIN: I'm into this, personally.
SAM: We have no idea.

00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:20.574
MARISHA: Do it.

00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:22.339
ASHLEY: Does anybody else want to get a tattoo, or...?

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:23.481
LAURA: Maybe I wrote it down wrong.

00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:26.211
Maybe the big emerald was 2,500 gold.
TRAVIS: For another 2,200, no.

00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:27.575
This is a party fund.

00:15:27.575 --> 00:15:29.173
LAURA: What do you think, Matt?

00:15:29.173 --> 00:15:31.308
You think maybe I wrote it down wrong?
MARISHA: And you just left an 0 off.

00:15:31.308 --> 00:15:33.233
LAURA: It was a pretty big emerald we found, wasn't it?

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:34.901
I mean, it was legendary.

00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:35.751
LIAM: 'Sup, Vex.

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.728
LAURA: This emerald.

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:39.806
I'm just trying to make this tattoo happen for our friend.

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:40.761
MATT: I understand. Well, it seems like

00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:42.990
you guys have the means of doing some.
SAM: We got the residuum. We got this.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.823
TALIESIN: Pretty cool.

00:15:43.823 --> 00:15:45.505
TRAVIS: Can we trade Orly some drugs,

00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:48.213
like a really cool tattoo parlor?

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:50.178
MARISHA: I do have a lot of suude.

00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:51.911
ASHLEY: What color is the residuum?
MARISHA: But it's about the materials.

00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:52.800
SAM: It's green.
TALIESIN: Green.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.633
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Green?

00:15:53.633 --> 00:15:54.766
SAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Oh!

00:15:54.766 --> 00:15:57.591
SAM: So you'll have, like, two shades of green in there.

00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.079
It's kind of awesome.

00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:00.187
ASHLEY: That's going to be cool.

00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:02.496
MARISHA: Fire the cannons!

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.103
SAM: Yeah, let's do it.

00:16:04.103 --> 00:16:06.389
MATT: (as Orly) "You all ready?"

00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:07.764
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm ready.

00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:09.022
MATT: "Sit on down."

00:16:09.022 --> 00:16:10.357
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:16:10.357 --> 00:16:13.692
SAM: Do you need any whiskey to numb the pain?

00:16:13.692 --> 00:16:15.584
ASHLEY: Nah.
SAM: Whoa!

00:16:16.938 --> 00:16:19.628
MATT: "That a girl."
ASHLEY: Just straight.

00:16:19.628 --> 00:16:22.398
MATT: And he gets out his tattooing device

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:24.948
and begins to take the gems

00:16:24.948 --> 00:16:27.269
and grind them into the proper dust,

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:29.878
and prepare himself with the inks and the materials

00:16:29.878 --> 00:16:33.211
that were given by you and your friends.

00:16:34.403 --> 00:16:37.043
And slowly, in this final bit of time

00:16:37.043 --> 00:16:39.419
that you have here on Rumblecusp,

00:16:39.419 --> 00:16:41.914
as you guys are putting your affairs in order,

00:16:41.914 --> 00:16:43.855
he begins to complete this tattoo,

00:16:43.855 --> 00:16:46.988
all along the side, down your neck and across the shoulder,

00:16:46.988 --> 00:16:48.293
to as far down the arm as you'd like

00:16:48.293 --> 00:16:51.685
in whatever type of design you would like.

00:16:51.685 --> 00:16:53.443
So you guide him as he goes,

00:16:53.443 --> 00:16:56.326
and give what the inspiration is

00:16:56.326 --> 00:17:00.163
for the different shapes around the runes of Orphan Maker,

00:17:00.163 --> 00:17:02.649
if there's anything specific to that

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.568
you'd like to embellish on,

00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:07.423
he imparts it within your skin.

00:17:07.423 --> 00:17:08.556
ASHLEY: I think

00:17:10.137 --> 00:17:15.137
maybe some vines with some flowers

00:17:15.479 --> 00:17:20.479
weaving through the runes

00:17:20.657 --> 00:17:21.817
and sort of all the way down.

00:17:21.817 --> 00:17:23.128
LAURA: Whoa!
ASHLEY: To the--

00:17:23.128 --> 00:17:24.787
MATT: To the tip of the finger?
ASHLEY: To the, yeah.

00:17:24.787 --> 00:17:27.244
MATT: I like it. Okay, all right.

00:17:27.244 --> 00:17:29.751
LAURA: That's dope.
MATT: That's pretty cool.

00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:31.471
Yeah, easily enough done.

00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:33.228
It takes a number of hours, but he does so,

00:17:33.228 --> 00:17:35.064
and it's a painful experience

00:17:35.064 --> 00:17:37.181
for any person who isn't as used to

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:39.182
embracing pain as you are.

00:17:39.182 --> 00:17:42.344
Stoically, you just take it without a change in expression,

00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:44.541
and as it comes to a completion,

00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:47.316
the spiking numb pain down the body

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:50.000
from just the needle tickle across the skin,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
you look over the art and...

00:17:55.828 --> 00:17:57.394
it's been a long time

00:17:57.394 --> 00:18:02.061
since you've allowed yourself to be a canvas for beauty.

00:18:03.426 --> 00:18:05.659
And it feels nice.

00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:11.101
ASHLEY: This is beautiful, Orly.

00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:14.068
MATT: "Well, I don't mean to brag, but

00:18:15.252 --> 00:18:18.842
"I had a lot of time to myself on the shore,

00:18:18.842 --> 00:18:23.468
"just waiting, so I like to sketch."

00:18:25.893 --> 00:18:27.230
ASHLEY: I quite like it.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.638
MATT: "Well, one of my finest work."

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520
ASHLEY: Thank you.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:36.796
MATT: "Least I can do for my crew.

00:18:38.189 --> 00:18:42.258
"Anyway, best we start getting our folks together

00:18:42.258 --> 00:18:45.308
"and m-m-make our way back."

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.080
So that is a permanent
plus one to your dexterity.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.446
ALL: Yay!

00:18:50.446 --> 00:18:52.862
SAM: Are you-- you're maxed out now.

00:18:52.862 --> 00:18:54.867
You're a 20.
ASHLEY: 20 across the board.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.781
(laughter)

00:18:56.781 --> 00:18:57.922
MATT: Whoa!

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.712
ASHLEY: Let me add this in.

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:07.754
TALIESIN: Got to do the button.

00:19:09.884 --> 00:19:12.466
MATT: And so, as that's being done,

00:19:12.466 --> 00:19:14.473
then we come to where we ended last episode,

00:19:14.473 --> 00:19:17.032
with you guys making the jaunt

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:19.024
towards the Tide Peak Tower in Nicodranas,

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:23.539
your brief discussion with Yussa, within his tower,

00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:25.411
letting him know of some of your concerns

00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:29.194
and imploring him to look into what information he may have

00:19:29.194 --> 00:19:33.364
on the Eyes of Nine, and this vision you had

00:19:33.364 --> 00:19:35.976
while you then, exiting his tower,

00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:37.386
make your way into the familiar

00:19:37.386 --> 00:19:40.310
and welcoming streets of Nicodranas, mid-day.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.318
So, Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

00:19:46.937 --> 00:19:50.696
LIAM: Feels good to be in civilization again.

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:54.059
LAURA: Yeah.

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.460
LIAM: Beautiful here.

00:19:57.776 --> 00:19:59.664
TRAVIS: It is strange, though, to see all these faces

00:19:59.664 --> 00:20:01.713
just going about their business.

00:20:01.713 --> 00:20:05.038
Sort of blithely unaware of the islands

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:08.221
that are just out there, full of crazy shit.

00:20:10.941 --> 00:20:13.447
TALIESIN: This is quite a change.

00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:17.021
Do we want to make sure we have somewhere to sleep tonight?

00:20:17.021 --> 00:20:19.143
LAURA: We always have somewhere to sleep in Nicodranas.

00:20:19.143 --> 00:20:19.976
TALIESIN: Fair.

00:20:20.976 --> 00:20:22.384
Want to shop?

00:20:22.384 --> 00:20:26.049
Do we want to find people?

00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:28.952
LAURA: We have lots of money;
we could buy so much.

00:20:30.535 --> 00:20:32.905
We could make beautiful dresses for horses again,

00:20:32.905 --> 00:20:35.546
it was a good way to spend money last time.

00:20:35.546 --> 00:20:36.782
TRAVIS: We made dresses for horses?

00:20:36.782 --> 00:20:38.736
LAURA: No, I did.
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:20:38.736 --> 00:20:40.545
LAURA: They're very expensive.

00:20:40.545 --> 00:20:42.278
TALIESIN: The horses have dresses now?

00:20:42.278 --> 00:20:44.028
LAURA: Well, yes.

00:20:45.648 --> 00:20:46.881
TALIESIN: I feel like I missed that.

00:20:46.881 --> 00:20:49.556
TRAVIS: I do, too.
LAURA: I did that before.

00:20:49.556 --> 00:20:50.833
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:51.675
LAURA: On my own.

00:20:51.675 --> 00:20:53.572
TALIESIN: I feel like that's the
sort of thing I would've noticed.

00:20:53.572 --> 00:20:54.843
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:20:54.843 --> 00:20:56.709
ASHLEY: What did they look like?

00:20:56.709 --> 00:21:00.466
LAURA: Very frilly, like, petticoats, everything.

00:21:00.466 --> 00:21:02.779
I had a carriage when I first left here,

00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:06.360
and it was the most glamorous carriage

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.361
you could ever imagine,

00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:12.157
and I had horses with dresses that took me around.

00:21:12.157 --> 00:21:13.531
ASHLEY: My goodness.
LAURA: I know!

00:21:13.531 --> 00:21:14.686
It was a dumb purchase,

00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:17.483
but I think worth it, at the time.

00:21:17.483 --> 00:21:19.231
TALIESIN: Does the dress stop around the midsection,

00:21:19.231 --> 00:21:20.761
or does it make it down all four legs?

00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:23.851
TRAVIS: Okay, remind me of our plan.

00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:25.808
We will stop by to see your mother for a bit,

00:21:25.808 --> 00:21:28.393
and then are we going straight to Zadash,

00:21:28.393 --> 00:21:30.924
or one of the Cobalt Reserve locations?

00:21:30.924 --> 00:21:34.465
SAM: We were going to do some research on stuff,

00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:35.630
on Nine Eyes, right?

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.046
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:39.033
SAM: But also with a mind towards

00:21:39.033 --> 00:21:42.925
heading towards the baddies,

00:21:42.925 --> 00:21:44.183
the Rexxentrums.

00:21:44.183 --> 00:21:46.151
LIAM: We were going to check in with Jester's mother,

00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:47.726
with your family--
SAM: Of course.

00:21:47.726 --> 00:21:50.015
LIAM: With the libraries at home,

00:21:50.015 --> 00:21:51.581
and then maybe see about

00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:55.511
picking up a little extra work.

00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:56.531
SAM: Extra work?

00:21:56.531 --> 00:21:57.380
LIAM: In the Assembly, yeah.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.669
SAM: Does not pay very much.

00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:59.985
LIAM: No, that's what I hear.

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:02.398
(laughter)

00:22:02.398 --> 00:22:03.606
SAM: But you know, you get points.

00:22:03.606 --> 00:22:04.935
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:22:04.935 --> 00:22:06.771
SAM: Get free food, free craft service.

00:22:06.771 --> 00:22:08.672
TALIESIN: I do okay, I have a unique look.

00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:11.764
(laughter)

00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:14.383
SAM: Oh, you play thugs and stuff?

00:22:14.383 --> 00:22:16.032
(laughter)

00:22:16.032 --> 00:22:17.672
TALIESIN: Not a lot of firbolgs.

00:22:17.672 --> 00:22:21.886
(laughter)

00:22:21.886 --> 00:22:23.828
Dumbest joke.
MATT: That's pretty dumb.

00:22:25.745 --> 00:22:28.876
TALIESIN: So where are we going after this, then?

00:22:28.876 --> 00:22:32.859
LIAM: Well, maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves.

00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:34.400
I do need to go shopping.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.675
I am highly in need of high quality--

00:22:36.675 --> 00:22:38.483
LAURA: Paper.
LIAM: -- paper and ink.

00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:41.066
(laughter)

00:22:41.066 --> 00:22:43.594
LIAM: It has been a while

00:22:43.594 --> 00:22:45.450
since I've been anywhere near a storefront

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.301
or a bookstore, so.

00:22:47.301 --> 00:22:49.719
SAM: (like Caleb) ♪ It's been a while ♪
LIAM: ♪ It has been a while. ♪

00:22:49.719 --> 00:22:53.891
(laughter)

00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:56.953
LIAM: And I'm sure we could restock up on supplies,

00:22:56.953 --> 00:22:58.842
and I'm sure there are curio shops

00:22:58.842 --> 00:23:01.288
and places to get interesting doodads and lots of things.

00:23:01.288 --> 00:23:02.304
LAURA: Maybe we know of all of them.

00:23:02.304 --> 00:23:03.479
We've spent enough time here.

00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:06.280
LIAM: Yeah, and then we end the day with your mother.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.439
Do you want to let her know that we're here in advance, or?

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.920
LAURA: It is a lot of fun to see her surprised.

00:23:17.642 --> 00:23:19.496
Maybe I'll sneak by, just to make sure

00:23:19.496 --> 00:23:22.958
that she doesn't have company tonight.

00:23:22.958 --> 00:23:25.833
But I don't want to let her know that we're here.

00:23:30.303 --> 00:23:32.564
LIAM: Well, I have some paper to find.

00:23:32.564 --> 00:23:35.147
(laughter)

00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:37.977
MATT: All right, well there are a number of shops

00:23:37.977 --> 00:23:41.323
that you could acquire elements

00:23:41.323 --> 00:23:42.594
of the paper and inks that you require.

00:23:42.594 --> 00:23:45.350
It's a bit piecemeal; you have to go from place to place,

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.433
because

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.612
materials for the purposes of magic

00:23:51.612 --> 00:23:54.128
in what some of you delve in are

00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:57.353
rare to find in general,

00:23:57.353 --> 00:23:59.928
and then those people that do take an interest

00:23:59.928 --> 00:24:02.825
tend to run through the stock pretty rapidly.

00:24:02.825 --> 00:24:05.565
But after a couple of stops, you manage to cobble together--

00:24:05.565 --> 00:24:06.609
how much do you need, by the way?

00:24:06.609 --> 00:24:11.609
LIAM: I would like to spend 100 platinum on paper.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.043
MARISHA: Wow.

00:24:13.043 --> 00:24:14.122
MATT: All right.

00:24:14.122 --> 00:24:15.922
LAURA: That's so much paper.

00:24:15.922 --> 00:24:18.472
How are you going to carry that much paper?
MARISHA: Like a pallet of paper? Yeah.

00:24:18.472 --> 00:24:19.358
MATT: I will say--

00:24:19.358 --> 00:24:20.712
TRAVIS: We got a bag of holding.

00:24:20.712 --> 00:24:23.428
LIAM: I have the Vault of Amber.
MATT: You can, at this moment-

00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:27.393
acquire 700 gold worth,

00:24:27.393 --> 00:24:30.149
so 70 platinum worth, here,

00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:32.477
and you're now unable to find the rest.

00:24:32.477 --> 00:24:34.609
You may have to go looking in another location.

00:24:34.609 --> 00:24:37.112
TRAVIS: There's no more paper on the Menagerie Coast.

00:24:37.112 --> 00:24:40.534
(laughter)
LIAM: I cleaned out Nicodranas.

00:24:40.534 --> 00:24:43.309
TALIESIN: I'm going to check out for some diamonds

00:24:43.309 --> 00:24:44.839
if we can find any diamonds.

00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:46.513
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:24:46.513 --> 00:24:47.346
TALIESIN: A little bit of saffron,

00:24:47.346 --> 00:24:48.679
because I'm starting to run low

00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:53.149
on my mushroom stuff,

00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:56.272
and if there's anywhere I can find a five-gold token

00:24:56.272 --> 00:24:59.345
of the Wild Mother for some other stuff that's coming up.

00:24:59.345 --> 00:25:01.491
MATT: Totally, a five dollar token for the Wild Mother,

00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:03.106
quite easy to find.

00:25:03.106 --> 00:25:04.147
There are a number of places

00:25:04.147 --> 00:25:06.866
that have varying scales of worship,

00:25:06.866 --> 00:25:08.890
from small carts on the side of the road,

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.484
people sell all sorts of trinkets and baubles

00:25:10.484 --> 00:25:14.977
to represent different members of the Prime Deity circle,

00:25:14.977 --> 00:25:16.696
to a number of temples

00:25:16.696 --> 00:25:18.505
that are specifically to the Wild Mother,

00:25:18.505 --> 00:25:22.058
who's a very important figure in a bay,

00:25:22.058 --> 00:25:23.417
and a coastal ship,

00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:24.708
to the point where the lighthouse here

00:25:24.708 --> 00:25:26.872
is a massive visage of her.
TALIESIN: Figured they'd have that--

00:25:26.872 --> 00:25:28.228
Street vendor.

00:25:28.228 --> 00:25:29.201
Saffron?

00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:32.149
MATT: Saffron, it's a little harder to find than

00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:34.167
in inland locations,

00:25:34.167 --> 00:25:36.182
especially something so close to the ocean,

00:25:36.182 --> 00:25:37.482
but it is findable.

00:25:37.482 --> 00:25:38.638
TALIESIN: 50 gold worth?

00:25:38.638 --> 00:25:41.906
MATT: Oh yeah, you can find 50 gold worth.

00:25:41.906 --> 00:25:43.787
About as much of a trek to get all the paper.

00:25:43.787 --> 00:25:45.238
TALIESIN: Diamonds, I suppose, if there's any.

00:25:45.238 --> 00:25:46.963
MATT: Diamonds you can find.

00:25:46.963 --> 00:25:49.946
Those that you find here are largely already cut.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.696
Are you looking for diamond dust or solid diamonds?

00:25:56.696 --> 00:25:59.337
LAURA: We need to find diamonds that are

00:25:59.337 --> 00:26:01.225
1000 gold worth of diamond.

00:26:01.225 --> 00:26:05.505
In a spell that takes 1000 gold worth of diamond,

00:26:05.505 --> 00:26:07.124
can you use multiple diamonds to make that?

00:26:07.124 --> 00:26:08.820
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Okay.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.813
MATT: 1000 gold worth of diamonds,

00:26:10.813 --> 00:26:13.447
unless it says specifically, it says "a diamond worth."

00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:14.280
LAURA: Okay, let me look.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.392
MATT: If it's specifies a singular diamond,

00:26:17.392 --> 00:26:19.779
then that's a challenge.
TRAVIS: We should've gone to those mines.

00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:20.704
LAURA: I mean.

00:26:21.973 --> 00:26:25.390
TALIESIN: I mean, you say that, and you're right.

00:26:26.387 --> 00:26:28.720
LAURA: "A diamond worth--"
TALIESIN: "Diamond dust worth 100 gp--"

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.952
MATT: So then you have to find an actual,

00:26:30.952 --> 00:26:32.677
a singular stone that is worth that much.

00:26:32.677 --> 00:26:34.328
TRAVIS: Would there be 1000-gold diamonds

00:26:34.328 --> 00:26:37.354
in those mines that we didn't go into?

00:26:37.354 --> 00:26:38.495
LAURA: You don't know.
TRAVIS: Damn it.

00:26:38.495 --> 00:26:40.128
It's always worth a try.

00:26:40.128 --> 00:26:44.229
MATT: Thankfully, trade is fairly booming

00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:45.248
across the Menagerie Coast,

00:26:45.248 --> 00:26:48.252
especially in Nicodranas, which is in that cross-section

00:26:48.252 --> 00:26:52.079
between the Empire and the Concord.

00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:54.368
That being the case, with a little bit of research,

00:26:54.368 --> 00:26:55.490
you can find--

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:56.888
LAURA: I would know the fancy shops.

00:26:56.888 --> 00:26:58.852
MATT: Oh, you would, very much. You grew up here.

00:26:58.852 --> 00:27:00.189
Yeah, you can definitely find

00:27:00.189 --> 00:27:05.189
a diamond worth 1000 gold, one.

00:27:05.219 --> 00:27:09.394
Beyond that, you can find three others that are worth 300,

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:13.274
and another two that are worth 500,
depending on what you purchase..

00:27:13.274 --> 00:27:17.070
TALIESIN: I'll buy the 300 ones.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.910
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: All of them?

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:18.976
TALIESIN: Three 300s?

00:27:18.976 --> 00:27:21.446
MARISHA: I'll toss in 500 for that--

00:27:21.446 --> 00:27:23.156
LAURA: Biggie?
MARISHA: That biggie.

00:27:23.156 --> 00:27:26.786
LAURA: Okay, so we'll get the 1000-gold diamond one--

00:27:26.786 --> 00:27:28.213
TALIESIN: That's 900 gold.

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.384
MATT: You got it.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:27:29.384 --> 00:27:30.314
ASHLEY: I'll toss in some too,

00:27:30.314 --> 00:27:35.051
because, for my tattoo, so I can help with the--

00:27:35.051 --> 00:27:36.811
LAURA: Oh, okay, if you want to toss in another 500

00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:38.594
then we can get all of them.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:27:38.594 --> 00:27:39.476
LAURA: Okay.

00:27:39.476 --> 00:27:42.092
So we're just going to get both the 500 gold ones

00:27:42.092 --> 00:27:43.214
and the 1000 gold one.

00:27:43.214 --> 00:27:45.377
MATT: Sure, yeah, you bought all the diamonds.

00:27:45.377 --> 00:27:46.302
TALIESIN: All right.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.901
MATT: As if you weren't already making friends here,

00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:53.593
there are a couple of local jewelers

00:27:53.593 --> 00:27:56.504
that are very happy to have you as patrons.

00:27:56.504 --> 00:28:00.754
LAURA: Yes, and I remind them to visit the Lavish Chateau.

00:28:01.605 --> 00:28:06.023
MATT: "Oh, of course, I would not think of otherwise.

00:28:06.023 --> 00:28:08.855
"Right, okay, have a good day.

00:28:08.855 --> 00:28:10.254
"Thank you for your purchase!"

00:28:10.254 --> 00:28:11.229
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.785
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Can you all magic meld

00:28:15.785 --> 00:28:18.807
two 500-gold diamonds

00:28:18.807 --> 00:28:20.894
into one 1,000-gold diamond?

00:28:20.894 --> 00:28:22.710
LAURA: I don't think it works that way.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.526
MARISHA: I don't know how magic works.
LAURA: But maybe Caleb could,

00:28:24.526 --> 00:28:25.431
I don't know what things--

00:28:25.431 --> 00:28:27.764
TALIESIN: I think you can use
multiple diamonds for some of them.

00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:31.048
LAURA: Yes, you can.
TALIESIN: And then diamond dust for

00:28:31.048 --> 00:28:33.051
Greater Restoration's a thing.

00:28:33.051 --> 00:28:35.213
LIAM: I think I could make you one large, lumpy diamond

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:38.731
worth less than what you started with.

00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:41.722
TRAVIS: How many of us have healing potions?

00:28:41.722 --> 00:28:44.475
MARISHA: I have these guys.

00:28:44.475 --> 00:28:46.503
TRAVIS: So they're-- all right.

00:28:46.503 --> 00:28:50.534
We should probably find a store nearby that has some.

00:28:50.534 --> 00:28:52.107
ASHLEY: That's a good idea.

00:28:52.107 --> 00:28:57.107
SAM: Where would I go to get something enchanted?

00:28:57.185 --> 00:28:59.468
Is there such a store here?

00:28:59.468 --> 00:29:02.764
And would it be the same place that

00:29:02.764 --> 00:29:05.989
someone else is going, or?

00:29:05.989 --> 00:29:07.180
MATT: In--

00:29:08.691 --> 00:29:09.588
TRAVIS: Wizard shit.

00:29:09.588 --> 00:29:12.036
MATT: Yeah, depends on what enchantment you're looking for,

00:29:12.036 --> 00:29:12.869
and how powerful,

00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:17.746
because enchanting as a craft is fairly rare.

00:29:17.746 --> 00:29:19.592
To the point where, in Zadash,

00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:23.006
the only really major magical item broker

00:29:23.006 --> 00:29:26.256
that you've encountered there was Pumat.

00:29:28.629 --> 00:29:32.667
SAM: Basically, if I wanted to say, make another flask

00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:34.849
of unending something or whatever.

00:29:34.849 --> 00:29:36.518
Where did I get that? Was that in Zadash?

00:29:36.518 --> 00:29:37.518
MARISHA: Pumat.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:37.518 --> 00:29:39.083
MATT: You had that made by Pumat, yeah.

00:29:39.083 --> 00:29:40.033
SAM: Oh wow, all right.

00:29:40.033 --> 00:29:42.165
TALIESIN: When we go back there.
SAM: Guess we'll go back there.

00:29:42.165 --> 00:29:43.398
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Oh, I guess I can remove

00:29:43.398 --> 00:29:46.951
my penis party favors from my inventory.

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:49.382
TALIESIN: I imagine you saved a few of them.-
SAM: Keep one.

00:29:49.382 --> 00:29:50.841
MARISHA: Yeah, you have to have one for the scrapbook,

00:29:50.841 --> 00:29:53.253
for the shadowbox that you make later on.
LAURA: Penis party favor, you got it.

00:29:53.253 --> 00:29:56.127
TALIESIN: There's no longer a
plethora of penis party favors.

00:29:56.127 --> 00:30:00.044
MATT: While Nicodranas is popular in trade, most--

00:30:00.044 --> 00:30:02.849
you don't have knowledge of any specific

00:30:02.849 --> 00:30:04.906
major magic item emporiums here.

00:30:04.906 --> 00:30:07.154
You have to keep an eye out for specific items

00:30:07.154 --> 00:30:11.310
that flow through different trade passages and shops.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.489
You'd have better luck in larger cities,

00:30:14.489 --> 00:30:16.005
like Zadash or Rexxentrum.

00:30:16.005 --> 00:30:18.610
SAM: Could, if I just wanted some incense,

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.198
or a glowing-- or a phosphorescent material,

00:30:22.198 --> 00:30:24.643
would Caleb be able to pick that up for me, where he went?

00:30:24.643 --> 00:30:25.926
MATT: Yeah, he could probably do that.

00:30:25.926 --> 00:30:27.890
SAM: Caleb, get me some incense,

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.782
or some "phosphorescent material."

00:30:30.782 --> 00:30:32.023
LIAM: <i>Eins</i>--

00:30:33.728 --> 00:30:35.807
MARISHA: Is there a general store?

00:30:35.807 --> 00:30:40.057
There's actually Seafarer's Bounty, right?

00:30:40.057 --> 00:30:41.760
MATT: Yeah.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.199
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll go there.

00:30:43.199 --> 00:30:46.036
MATT: All righty. You make your
way to the Seafarer's Bounty.

00:30:46.036 --> 00:30:47.144
TRAVIS: Notes.

00:30:47.144 --> 00:30:49.961
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, really good notes.

00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:50.794
TALIESIN: Jester, I'll trade you--

00:30:50.794 --> 00:30:52.609
MATT: Seafloor's Bounty.

00:30:52.609 --> 00:30:53.663
MARISHA: Seafloor's Bounty.

00:30:53.663 --> 00:30:55.478
MATT: Yes, in the Open Quay, or "key."

00:30:55.478 --> 00:30:56.847
LIAM: We'll say that I give you everything

00:30:56.847 --> 00:31:00.775
for one Frumpkin summoning, which takes incense,

00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:01.893
and I'll just deduct that.

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:03.268
MATT: You walk back into the

00:31:03.268 --> 00:31:07.648
somewhat scattered, cluttered pawn shop, if you will,

00:31:07.648 --> 00:31:10.228
and there within you see the older female gnome,

00:31:10.228 --> 00:31:12.278
Sheila Bobsnopper,

00:31:12.278 --> 00:31:15.595
who you've run in before previously,

00:31:15.595 --> 00:31:16.984
lean forward and,

00:31:16.984 --> 00:31:18.662
"Hi, can I help you?"

00:31:18.662 --> 00:31:21.462
MARISHA: I need ball bearings,

00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:23.909
lots more ball bearings.
SAM: You ran out of ball bearings?

00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:26.075
MARISHA: I ran out, I got like 300 left

00:31:26.075 --> 00:31:28.070
out of my bag of 1000.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.965
So yeah, do you sell bags of ball bearings?

00:31:30.965 --> 00:31:33.835
And also, bottle rockets.

00:31:33.835 --> 00:31:37.159
MATT: "Oh, well I can certainly get you some bottle rockets.

00:31:37.159 --> 00:31:41.457
"As far as the ball bearings go, I can get you... some."

00:31:41.457 --> 00:31:42.876
MARISHA: How many?

00:31:42.876 --> 00:31:43.753
MATT: "A few hundred."

00:31:43.753 --> 00:31:45.518
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:45.518 --> 00:31:48.642
Here, just refill this bag with as much as you can.

00:31:48.642 --> 00:31:52.513
Do you have other fireworks other than bottle rockets?

00:31:52.513 --> 00:31:54.341
MATT: "I mean, there are a number of explosives

00:31:54.341 --> 00:31:56.083
"that we have for various celebrations."

00:31:56.083 --> 00:31:59.021
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, do you have a variety bag?

00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:00.749
MATT: "How much do you have to spend?"

00:32:01.782 --> 00:32:03.624
MARISHA: Let's just say...

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.345
plenty.

00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:10.732
Any. I could buy you out. I could probably buy the shop.

00:32:10.732 --> 00:32:11.824
TRAVIS: Whoa!

00:32:14.237 --> 00:32:15.925
MATT: "I'll be right back."

00:32:15.925 --> 00:32:19.534
She looks out the front door, and closes it,

00:32:19.534 --> 00:32:21.006
shutters the windows,

00:32:21.006 --> 00:32:23.574
puts on a couple of lanterns,

00:32:23.574 --> 00:32:26.154
goes into the back room.

00:32:26.154 --> 00:32:30.208
Before she goes, she refills your bag of ball bearings

00:32:30.208 --> 00:32:33.091
to 630 ball bearings.

00:32:33.091 --> 00:32:36.500
MARISHA: Yeah, replenish the ball bearings.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.442
MATT: I have to look up again

00:32:37.442 --> 00:32:39.649
how much a bag of ball bearings is.

00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:41.368
TRAVIS: Come on, that's the offhand knowledge.

00:32:41.368 --> 00:32:43.686
MATT: Yeah, you're right, you're right, I apologize.

00:32:43.686 --> 00:32:44.949
TRAVIS: That's all right, just don't let it happen again.

00:32:44.949 --> 00:32:47.699
MATT: My inability-- I won't, I won't.

00:32:49.048 --> 00:32:49.881
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:32:51.071 --> 00:32:53.212
MATT: Here we go, getting over into the

00:32:53.212 --> 00:32:55.237
tools and items here.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.232
Eh, four silver.

00:33:05.232 --> 00:33:06.065
MARISHA: Okay.

00:33:06.919 --> 00:33:08.086
MATT: You're fine.

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:13.422
And then, after a moment, comes back with a large cart.

00:33:13.422 --> 00:33:15.252
(squeaking)

00:33:15.252 --> 00:33:16.858
Rolls it out, and sets it.

00:33:16.858 --> 00:33:19.890
There are barrels and small cases

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.737
with all manner of fuses and sticks

00:33:22.737 --> 00:33:26.462
and strange explosive cylinders.

00:33:27.493 --> 00:33:30.482
Quite a bit, we're talking four backpacks' worth here.

00:33:30.482 --> 00:33:34.002
And you have no idea of how powerful these may be.

00:33:34.002 --> 00:33:35.473
MARISHA: Okay.

00:33:35.473 --> 00:33:37.473
MATT: "I'll give you the lot."

00:33:38.705 --> 00:33:39.853
MARISHA: You'll give me the lot?

00:33:39.853 --> 00:33:41.496
MATT: "For 50 gold."

00:33:41.496 --> 00:33:43.054
MARISHA: (gasps)

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:43.887
Done.

00:33:44.758 --> 00:33:46.194
MATT: "It's been a pleasure doing business,"

00:33:46.194 --> 00:33:47.247
and she wheels the cart in your direction--

00:33:47.247 --> 00:33:50.145
MARISHA: I toss her five more gold as a tip.

00:33:50.145 --> 00:33:52.953
MATT: "My goodness, so generous!

00:33:52.953 --> 00:33:55.395
"What's your name, if I might ask?"

00:33:55.395 --> 00:33:58.162
MARISHA: Beauregard. Pirate Beauregard.

00:33:59.002 --> 00:34:00.265
MATT: "Interesting first name.

00:34:00.265 --> 00:34:01.701
"Parents really had a plan for you."

00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:03.826
MARISHA: They did, yeah.
MATT: "Pirate Beauregard.

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.465
"Sheila, Sheila Bobsnopper."

00:34:06.465 --> 00:34:08.171
MARISHA: We've actually met before.

00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:10.412
MATT: "Oh! Oh, well that's embarrassing, I'm so sorry."

00:34:10.412 --> 00:34:13.203
MARISHA: No, I mean, I was just passing through.

00:34:13.203 --> 00:34:16.836
You've got a very memorable face.

00:34:17.757 --> 00:34:20.928
MATT: "You would, too, if it wasn't so darkly lit in here

00:34:20.928 --> 00:34:22.411
"from all the lanterns.

00:34:22.411 --> 00:34:24.487
"I've turned off and closed the windows.

00:34:24.487 --> 00:34:26.059
That's on me, that's on me. Anyway."

00:34:26.059 --> 00:34:27.152
MARISHA: Do you need help with this?

00:34:27.152 --> 00:34:28.561
MATT: "No, I've got it, it's fine.

00:34:28.561 --> 00:34:31.442
"I'm happy to. If you could just get
this out of here as soon as possible

00:34:31.442 --> 00:34:33.722
"so as to not garner any suspicion. This is a lot of--"

00:34:33.722 --> 00:34:35.222
MARISHA: Are these super illegal?

00:34:35.222 --> 00:34:37.969
MATT: "Just a large amount draws a lot of attention

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.279
that I don't want on me,

00:34:39.279 --> 00:34:41.205
"and on you, that's your problem, so."

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:43.225
She's pushing it toward the door. (squeaking)

00:34:43.225 --> 00:34:44.739
TRAVIS: It's a cart, like a cart of fireworks?

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.035
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Cool. Good.

00:34:47.035 --> 00:34:48.930
LAURA: What the fuck are you going
to do with a cart of fireworks?

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:50.388
MARISHA: I don't know.
TRAVIS: Cobblestone streets?

00:34:50.388 --> 00:34:52.384
Like clack-a-clack-a-clack.

00:34:52.384 --> 00:34:53.556
MATT: You know the guy in Willy Wonka,

00:34:53.556 --> 00:34:56.568
who's pushing the cart with all the plates and shit hanging?

00:34:56.568 --> 00:34:57.540
"Nobody ever goes in!"

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.921
(laughter)

00:34:59.921 --> 00:35:01.739
TRAVIS: We'll just stop at Nicodranas real quick,

00:35:01.739 --> 00:35:05.047
pick up a felony, no big deal.

00:35:05.047 --> 00:35:06.660
MATT: To be fair, what's more Beauregard than that?

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.502
TRAVIS: True.

00:35:07.502 --> 00:35:08.873
MARISHA: Gotta go across the border.
TALIESIN: Who's going to come home with a pet,

00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:10.590
is what I want to know.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.381
LIAM: I'm going to put them all on the Vault of Amber

00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:14.702
and someday have Astrid dispel

00:35:14.702 --> 00:35:17.285
and all these fireworks go (explosion).

00:35:17.285 --> 00:35:18.958
MATT: (laughs)

00:35:18.958 --> 00:35:20.431
MARISHA: So I do need-- yeah,

00:35:20.431 --> 00:35:22.681
I find Fjord or Caleb,

00:35:22.681 --> 00:35:24.041
whoever has the bag of holding--

00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:26.270
MATT: Are you attempting to be quiet with this?

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.315
(laughter)

00:35:28.315 --> 00:35:29.940
MARISHA: No, not really.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.925
LAURA: Maybe put your cloak over the cart at least?

00:35:31.925 --> 00:35:33.013
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll throw my--

00:35:33.013 --> 00:35:34.713
it really does feel like driving to Indiana

00:35:34.713 --> 00:35:35.829
to buy fireworks.

00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:37.436
That's what we had to do in Kentucky.

00:35:37.436 --> 00:35:40.426
Driving across state border. Okay,

00:35:40.426 --> 00:35:41.690
yeah, so I throw my cloak over

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.979
just so it looks like laundry.

00:35:44.979 --> 00:35:46.079
LAURA: (wheezes)

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.616
MATT: Okay.

00:35:47.616 --> 00:35:48.475
TRAVIS: Uh huh.

00:35:48.475 --> 00:35:50.381
SAM: Sure.
TRAVIS: Laundry.

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:53.444
MATT: Sure, okay, all right, all right, all right.

00:35:53.444 --> 00:35:57.595
So you make your way towards the Lavish Chateau?

00:35:57.595 --> 00:36:00.503
LIAM: It's like a Little Orphan Annie scheme.
MATT: Where are you heading towards?

00:36:00.503 --> 00:36:02.336
TRAVIS: Yeah. Laundry once a year.

00:36:03.848 --> 00:36:05.712
MARISHA: Yeah, is that where they are?

00:36:05.712 --> 00:36:07.165
MATT: Well, some people are out shopping,

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:09.323
Caleb's buying all the paper in Nicodranas.

00:36:09.323 --> 00:36:10.156
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:36:12.217 --> 00:36:13.626
MATT: Up to you.

00:36:13.626 --> 00:36:14.777
I'll say--

00:36:15.635 --> 00:36:17.083
TRAVIS: How do you want to do this?

00:36:17.083 --> 00:36:18.893
(laughter)

00:36:18.893 --> 00:36:21.118
MARISHA: (sizzling)

00:36:21.118 --> 00:36:24.986
MATT: You do notice partway towards the Opal Archways

00:36:24.986 --> 00:36:27.851
that a handful of zhelezo are trailing you

00:36:27.851 --> 00:36:30.207
from about 25, 30 feet back.

00:36:30.207 --> 00:36:31.231
MARISHA: They're trailing me?
MATT: Yeah.

00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:33.839
MARISHA: All right, I just clock them as I keep going.

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:34.672
MATT: Okay.

00:36:38.197 --> 00:36:40.905
Okay, and you make your way to where?

00:36:40.905 --> 00:36:42.113
MARISHA: I guess-- I don't know.

00:36:42.113 --> 00:36:43.706
Do I know where people went?

00:36:43.706 --> 00:36:45.076
Did we all just scatter?

00:36:45.076 --> 00:36:46.982
MATT: Everyone kind of scattered, yeah.

00:36:46.982 --> 00:36:49.390
TRAVIS: We're a bunch of middle schoolers at a theme park.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:50.575
MATT: Yep.

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:51.731
TRAVIS: No plan.

00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:54.446
ASHLEY: We do need to get some healing potions.

00:36:54.446 --> 00:36:55.481
TRAVIS: We do.

00:36:55.481 --> 00:36:58.722
SAM: I went toy shopping and clothes shopping.

00:36:58.722 --> 00:36:59.738
MATT: Perfect.

00:37:00.933 --> 00:37:03.126
MARISHA: I'll just head to the Lavish Chateau,

00:37:03.126 --> 00:37:04.877
wait out front. I know they'll be there.

00:37:04.877 --> 00:37:06.033
LIAM: With your fireworks?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:37:06.033 --> 00:37:08.800
(laughter)

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.246
LIAM: Sorry ma'am, no loitering.

00:37:10.246 --> 00:37:12.646
MATT: (laughs)

00:37:12.646 --> 00:37:14.960
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Terrible idea.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.835
MATT: Eventually, as you're waiting outside a bit,

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:20.040
the zhelezo are watching, and begin to slowly approach,

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.101
right as Carlos comes to the door,

00:37:23.101 --> 00:37:27.477
who's the tavern manager of the Lavish Chateau.

00:37:27.477 --> 00:37:29.327
You've seen him before, though not formally introduced.

00:37:29.327 --> 00:37:33.851
He goes, "Excuse me, what are doing with this out front?"

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:35.381
MARISHA: This is Carlos?
MATT: Yes.

00:37:35.381 --> 00:37:37.939
MARISHA: Carlos, hey, it's me,

00:37:37.939 --> 00:37:40.519
Beauregard with the Mighty Nein, friend of Jester?

00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:41.352
MATT: "Oh, right."

00:37:41.352 --> 00:37:42.185
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:42.185 --> 00:37:44.681
Can I bring this inside real quick?

00:37:44.681 --> 00:37:45.764
MATT: "What is it?"

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:49.069
MARISHA: Goods, celebratory goods.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.479
It's going to be great.
MATT: He looks over your shoulder,

00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:54.741
and the three zhelezo walk up, like,

00:37:54.741 --> 00:37:57.324
"Is this person bothering you?"

00:37:58.158 --> 00:37:59.358
(as Carlos) "No, no, not at all.

00:37:59.358 --> 00:38:01.141
"They did a shopping job for me,

00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:03.749
"so do not worry, everything is good.

00:38:03.749 --> 00:38:06.137
"Thank you so much, we'll go ahead and take it around back,

00:38:06.137 --> 00:38:09.408
"and we'll put things away. You'll help me stock as well.

00:38:09.408 --> 00:38:11.069
"Thank you for your watchful eye."

00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:14.230
They kind of, "All right," and they walk--

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.921
MARISHA: Come see the Ruby of the Sea.

00:38:18.098 --> 00:38:19.934
MATT: "No, but seriously, what did you bring?"

00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:23.283
MARISHA: I just bought a bunch of fireworks, dude!

00:38:23.283 --> 00:38:26.027
MATT: "Okay, well now I'm--"

00:38:26.027 --> 00:38:27.328
MARISHA: This could amp up--

00:38:27.328 --> 00:38:28.549
MATT: "-- a conspirer."

00:38:28.549 --> 00:38:30.332
MARISHA: No! No, no, no.

00:38:30.332 --> 00:38:31.558
MATT: "Just bring it in, it's fine.

00:38:31.558 --> 00:38:34.297
"Just don't put it near any of the lantern oil, please."

00:38:34.297 --> 00:38:36.037
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, sure, that makes sense.

00:38:36.037 --> 00:38:37.298
MATT: "Bring it in."
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

00:38:37.298 --> 00:38:39.534
MATT: All right, so he helps you get it somewhere

00:38:39.534 --> 00:38:41.418
safe and out of sight.

00:38:41.418 --> 00:38:42.933
You're buying toys and clothes, you said?

00:38:42.933 --> 00:38:47.774
SAM: Yes, I'm going to buy some toys for my son,

00:38:47.774 --> 00:38:49.740
like a set of blocks,

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.032
and some more targets

00:38:53.032 --> 00:38:54.728
for him to shoot at.

00:38:54.728 --> 00:38:55.703
MATT: Okay.

00:38:57.102 --> 00:38:57.954
TALIESIN: They've got these tops,

00:38:57.954 --> 00:38:59.666
when you spin them, they make more tops,

00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:00.671
those are pretty cool.

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.375
TRAVIS: Ooh.
SAM: Oh.

00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:03.384
TALIESIN: That was a throwback.

00:39:03.384 --> 00:39:05.184
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: For you.

00:39:06.793 --> 00:39:07.868
SAM: And then, maybe,

00:39:07.868 --> 00:39:10.442
if there's time, some clothing shopping.

00:39:10.442 --> 00:39:15.442
I'd like to get matching family outfits,

00:39:15.857 --> 00:39:18.610
for a Christmas picture sort of a thing.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:20.060
MATT: Okay.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.725
Between all the custom outfits, the toy purchases,

00:39:22.725 --> 00:39:26.388
I'll say it'll put you back two and a half gold.

00:39:26.388 --> 00:39:28.748
SAM: Cool. Oh wow.

00:39:28.748 --> 00:39:31.143
I'll tip an extra copper.

00:39:31.143 --> 00:39:34.143
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:39:35.455 --> 00:39:37.561
MATT: How very Sam Riegel of you.

00:39:37.561 --> 00:39:40.694
(laughter)

00:39:42.406 --> 00:39:45.481
MATT: All righty, anybody else?

00:39:46.516 --> 00:39:49.906
LAURA: After I get done looking for diamonds with Caduceus

00:39:49.906 --> 00:39:51.706
I'm going to rush back to the Lavish Chateau

00:39:51.706 --> 00:39:54.444
so I can look for Bluud and try to hide from my mom

00:39:54.444 --> 00:39:57.704
and see if she is going to have any company tonight.

00:39:57.704 --> 00:40:00.346
MATT: Okay, all right, so as you make your way in

00:40:00.346 --> 00:40:02.351
you catch out of the corner of your eye

00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:05.417
Carlos and Beauregard are currently pushing a cart off

00:40:05.417 --> 00:40:09.492
behind one of the stacks of kegs and boxes.

00:40:10.866 --> 00:40:12.676
And as you make your way up the staircase

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:13.996
that leads to the secondary floor,

00:40:13.996 --> 00:40:16.876
you can see Bluud is sitting on the heavy stool,

00:40:16.876 --> 00:40:20.657
and he gets in a mode where he's kind of napping,

00:40:20.657 --> 00:40:22.832
but is still aware, you know?

00:40:22.832 --> 00:40:26.688
That creepy grandparent eyes-still-open nap,

00:40:26.688 --> 00:40:28.339
but he's paying attention, he's just like

00:40:28.339 --> 00:40:32.920
(snoring)
(laughter)

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.753
ASHLEY: Yep.

00:40:34.593 --> 00:40:36.067
MATT: "Jester."

00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:37.680
LAURA: Shh.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.513
MATT: "What are you-- where are you going?"

00:40:40.531 --> 00:40:42.439
LAURA: Is Momma busy?

00:40:43.754 --> 00:40:46.291
MATT: "At the moment I think she's just reading her books."

00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:49.541
LAURA: Is she going to have company tonight?

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.421
MATT: "I think she has somebody scheduled,

00:40:54.421 --> 00:40:57.154
"but, I mean, for you she'd change that,

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:59.112
"that can be pushed back."

00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:02.174
LAURA: Okay.

00:41:03.376 --> 00:41:04.785
MATT: "Do you need me to talk to her for you?"

00:41:04.785 --> 00:41:05.701
LAURA: (squeaks) No!

00:41:05.701 --> 00:41:07.776
Shh. (whispering) No.

00:41:09.016 --> 00:41:11.587
I was saying 'shh' to myself 'cause you were being quiet,

00:41:11.587 --> 00:41:12.645
and I wasn't.

00:41:14.463 --> 00:41:15.938
I'm just going to go say hi to her right now.

00:41:15.938 --> 00:41:17.772
MATT: "All right."
LAURA: Okay.

00:41:17.772 --> 00:41:20.251
MATT: "Fair enough, I'm going to get back to my watch."

00:41:20.251 --> 00:41:21.084
LAURA: Okay.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:26.006
I wave from the upstairs at Beau. (whispering) Hi!

00:41:26.006 --> 00:41:26.839
MARISHA: (whispering) Hi!

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:28.807
LAURA: Shh!
MARISHA: (silently) Okay.

00:41:28.807 --> 00:41:30.124
LAURA: And then I go in.

00:41:30.124 --> 00:41:30.957
MATT: Okay.

00:41:32.074 --> 00:41:34.478
You come and push open the doorway

00:41:34.478 --> 00:41:36.200
to your mother's quarters.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.909
You can see she still has the balcony doors and windows open

00:41:40.909 --> 00:41:44.780
with the long, silken elements of material

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.539
just flowing in the ocean breeze.

00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:49.760
The light that's filtering in, you can see across,

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.693
she has her bed, and she has her counter

00:41:52.693 --> 00:41:53.840
where she has her books set up there,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.655
and she's currently on the bed

00:41:55.655 --> 00:41:56.955
with the window behind her open,

00:41:56.955 --> 00:41:59.781
and she's reading by the sunlight as it's coming in.

00:41:59.781 --> 00:42:02.150
She looks up with a small pair of glasses

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.330
that she has on the end of her nose, and them takes off.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.163
"Jester?"

00:42:06.163 --> 00:42:08.755
LAURA: Shh, I'm surprising you.

00:42:10.399 --> 00:42:12.048
Look the other way.

00:42:12.048 --> 00:42:14.839
MATT: Sets her glasses, takes her book, closes it,

00:42:14.839 --> 00:42:16.589
puts it on the table.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.080
Gets off the edge of the bed and turns around.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.205
LAURA: I creep up behind her,

00:42:24.205 --> 00:42:26.353
put my hands over her eyes.

00:42:26.353 --> 00:42:27.561
MATT: "Oh!"

00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:29.096
LAURA: Guess who?

00:42:29.096 --> 00:42:30.771
MATT: "Is it...

00:42:30.771 --> 00:42:31.737
"Bluud?"

00:42:31.737 --> 00:42:32.828
LAURA: It's...

00:42:32.828 --> 00:42:34.111
your Little Sapphire!

00:42:34.111 --> 00:42:36.097
MATT: "What?!"

00:42:36.097 --> 00:42:38.144
Picks you up and gives you a huge hug,

00:42:38.144 --> 00:42:42.473
and begins just showering kisses across your face and goes,

00:42:42.473 --> 00:42:45.247
"Oh, my Jester, how are you?"

00:42:45.247 --> 00:42:47.102
LAURA: Good, I'm so glad to see you.

00:42:47.102 --> 00:42:49.413
MATT: "It's so wonderful to see you as well.

00:42:49.413 --> 00:42:51.963
"I did not expect you to return so quickly, you usually--"

00:42:51.963 --> 00:42:53.374
LAURA: Has it been quickly?

00:42:53.374 --> 00:42:55.983
MATT: "Well, I mean you generally go
for long periods of time, and--"

00:42:55.983 --> 00:42:59.083
LAURA: It feels like it's been <i>forever</i>, Mama.

00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:01.533
MATT: "You told me you had so much to do last time we spoke.

00:43:01.533 --> 00:43:04.583
I'm just happy to have you here.

00:43:05.523 --> 00:43:09.063
LAURA: We went to an island, and there was a fake god there,

00:43:09.063 --> 00:43:11.043
and then there was another fake god there,

00:43:11.043 --> 00:43:14.096
and then a real god came there, woof.

00:43:14.096 --> 00:43:17.044
MATT: "That is, what one would say, as escalation."

00:43:17.044 --> 00:43:18.747
LAURA: It was, it really was.

00:43:18.747 --> 00:43:22.907
MATT: "Wow, what did you do with all of these gods?"

00:43:22.907 --> 00:43:27.907
LAURA: Defeated one, befriended one, apologized to one.

00:43:29.266 --> 00:43:32.357
And at the end of the day everyone learned a lesson.

00:43:32.357 --> 00:43:35.890
MATT: "Well, I'm glad to hear there was
lessons to be learned on your adventures."

00:43:37.072 --> 00:43:39.856
LAURA: So all of us are in town again, can we stay here?

00:43:39.856 --> 00:43:41.391
MATT: "Oh, uh--"

00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:43.162
LAURA: I know you have company tonight, though.

00:43:43.162 --> 00:43:45.132
We can totally leave you alone.

00:43:46.274 --> 00:43:47.691
MATT: "They can delay.

00:43:48.606 --> 00:43:49.681
"It's me.

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.106
"Of course, of course, I'll get rooms ready.

00:43:53.106 --> 00:43:55.235
"Do you have more friends you've brought this time?"

00:43:55.235 --> 00:43:56.068
LAURA: The same amount of friends.

00:43:56.068 --> 00:43:58.555
MATT: "Same amount, okay, that can very easily be done."

00:43:58.555 --> 00:44:00.941
LAURA: But don't let Veth's family know,

00:44:00.941 --> 00:44:04.825
because I think she wants to surprise them, okay?

00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:08.041
MATT: "Very well, I will keep it a secret."

00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:11.088
SAM: (whispering) I think they rented an apartment.

00:44:11.088 --> 00:44:12.769
LAURA: Oh, they're not still at the Lavish Chateau?

00:44:12.769 --> 00:44:15.259
SAM: I think when I left last time,
I gave them money--

00:44:15.259 --> 00:44:17.396
MATT: Yeah, you gave them money to get an apartment.
SAM: --find a condo or something.

00:44:17.396 --> 00:44:18.568
LAURA: Oh, well then nevermind,

00:44:18.568 --> 00:44:21.299
I didn't realize they weren't here anymore.

00:44:21.299 --> 00:44:23.432
MATT: "It's all right--"
LAURA: Veth, are you here?

00:44:24.649 --> 00:44:25.743
SAM: Oh, hello!

00:44:25.743 --> 00:44:28.493
(laughter)

00:44:28.493 --> 00:44:30.489
MATT: "Veth, oh my goodness!"

00:44:30.489 --> 00:44:33.874
And runs up and grabs your shoulders and looks you over.

00:44:33.874 --> 00:44:35.195
"Ah, your beautiful face,

00:44:35.195 --> 00:44:36.533
"it's so good to see you again as well."

00:44:36.533 --> 00:44:37.673
SAM: You smell wonderful,

00:44:37.673 --> 00:44:40.913
which tells me that you repaired your bathtub?

00:44:40.913 --> 00:44:42.432
MATT: "Indeed, it's--"

00:44:42.432 --> 00:44:44.599
SAM: Excellent, excellent.

00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:47.686
MATT: "A worthy endeavor. It is, to be honest,

00:44:47.686 --> 00:44:50.724
"much better than the last one, so thank you?"

00:44:50.724 --> 00:44:53.366
SAM: If you need to be reimbursed or something,

00:44:53.366 --> 00:44:54.752
I don't want to--

00:44:54.752 --> 00:44:56.168
MATT: "It's fine."
SAM: All right.

00:44:56.168 --> 00:44:58.613
MATT: "We'll just say you owe me a favor."

00:44:58.613 --> 00:44:59.704
LAURA: Ooh.

00:45:00.737 --> 00:45:01.570
SAM: Okay.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:05.528
LAURA: That's serious, when Mama
asks for a favor, she means it.

00:45:05.528 --> 00:45:07.311
SAM: Oh.

00:45:07.311 --> 00:45:08.144
Okay.

00:45:08.144 --> 00:45:09.776
MATT: "It's so easy to do. Do not worry."

00:45:09.776 --> 00:45:12.871
SAM: Ooh, my heart, a little bit.

00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:16.111
I wanted to know where my family lives.

00:45:16.111 --> 00:45:18.561
MATT: "Oh, come to the balcony."

00:45:19.443 --> 00:45:21.127
And she brings you to the outside balcony,

00:45:21.127 --> 00:45:22.760
and as the warm light comes upon you,

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.602
again, you're still carrying your bundles of toys

00:45:24.602 --> 00:45:25.869
and outfits and such.

00:45:25.869 --> 00:45:27.419
She points down the Opal Archway.

00:45:27.419 --> 00:45:31.735
There is a set of small structures
and a set of four towers

00:45:31.735 --> 00:45:35.146
that come off the top of this larger complex, and she says,

00:45:35.146 --> 00:45:36.967
"Right there in the second tower,

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:39.475
"there is, you see these two windows

00:45:39.475 --> 00:45:41.145
"that are conjoined on that one balcony there?

00:45:41.145 --> 00:45:43.308
"That is where they're staying."

00:45:43.308 --> 00:45:45.812
SAM: Thank you, thank you so much.

00:45:45.812 --> 00:45:47.998
Have you seen them, are they okay?

00:45:47.998 --> 00:45:50.220
Do they come over for brunch and stuff? I don't know.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.468
MATT: "Yes, they come by, and we talk for a bit

00:45:52.468 --> 00:45:54.568
and just wanted to check up.

00:45:56.177 --> 00:45:57.785
They seem to be all right.

00:45:57.785 --> 00:45:59.368
I'm sure they'll be very happy to see you.

00:45:59.368 --> 00:46:02.504
SAM: All right, well I'll just message you--

00:46:02.504 --> 00:46:04.162
LAURA: Yeah!
SAM: Oh, bye!

00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:07.888
MATT: So Veth takes off.

00:46:07.888 --> 00:46:10.754
"I will make sure there's room
for you and all your friends."

00:46:10.754 --> 00:46:11.787
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:13.614 --> 00:46:14.726
MATT: "How are you?"

00:46:14.726 --> 00:46:17.167
LAURA: It feels good to...

00:46:18.092 --> 00:46:19.083
to be here.

00:46:19.995 --> 00:46:21.793
MATT: "It is good to have you here."
LAURA: Yeah.

00:46:21.793 --> 00:46:23.633
MATT: "How are you?"

00:46:23.633 --> 00:46:26.383
LAURA: I'm-- I'm good.

00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:28.055
Things are crazy.

00:46:28.055 --> 00:46:29.505
MATT: "Apparently."

00:46:29.505 --> 00:46:31.160
LAURA: Yeah.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.581
MATT: "Last I saw you you seemed
to be carrying a heavy weight."

00:46:34.581 --> 00:46:35.414
LAURA: Yeah.

00:46:36.466 --> 00:46:38.871
MATT: "Is that any lighter?"

00:46:38.871 --> 00:46:40.528
LAURA: Yes?

00:46:40.528 --> 00:46:42.590
MATT: "Well, that's good."

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:43.981
LAURA: Yeah, it...

00:46:45.373 --> 00:46:47.614
it was really hard, but...

00:46:51.173 --> 00:46:52.240
at the end of all of it,

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.777
it kind of made me realize what's important,

00:46:55.777 --> 00:46:59.110
and how important everyone around me is.

00:47:01.597 --> 00:47:04.172
MATT: "It's funny, I had an experience just like that."

00:47:04.172 --> 00:47:05.362
LAURA: You did?

00:47:05.362 --> 00:47:06.953
MATT: "Many years ago.

00:47:08.136 --> 00:47:09.469
"When I had you."

00:47:11.313 --> 00:47:12.802
LAURA: Mama, don't.

00:47:12.802 --> 00:47:15.847
(laughter)

00:47:15.847 --> 00:47:19.947
MATT: "What is the point of being a mother
if I cannot embarrass my beautiful daughter?"

00:47:21.163 --> 00:47:22.077
LAURA: I don't know where everyone is.

00:47:22.077 --> 00:47:23.278
I think Beau is downstairs,

00:47:23.278 --> 00:47:26.048
but I'm sure people will be showing up soon.

00:47:26.048 --> 00:47:28.288
MATT: "Well, I guess I should make sure

00:47:28.288 --> 00:47:31.657
"that I am ready and at the top of my game tonight."

00:47:31.657 --> 00:47:32.615
LAURA: Okay.

00:47:32.615 --> 00:47:34.006
Are you performing?!

00:47:34.006 --> 00:47:35.721
MATT: "I am now, if you have your friends here."

00:47:35.721 --> 00:47:38.068
LAURA: Oh my gosh, this is going to be wonderful!

00:47:38.068 --> 00:47:39.985
Okay okay okay.
MATT: "Okay.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:44.851
"I'll go delay my client."

00:47:44.851 --> 00:47:46.966
LAURA: I'll run downstairs and wait for everyone to show up.

00:47:46.966 --> 00:47:51.373
MATT: Okay, any other business
anyone wants to do while you're here?

00:47:51.373 --> 00:47:53.249
TRAVIS: Healing potions?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:47:53.249 --> 00:47:54.281
TRAVIS: Yes.
ASHLEY: We have to get some.

00:47:54.281 --> 00:47:56.719
TRAVIS: Any stores that we've visited before?

00:47:58.019 --> 00:48:00.643
My notes are not as thorough as Beau's.

00:48:01.935 --> 00:48:02.768
SAM: Oh.

00:48:04.342 --> 00:48:06.350
TRAVIS: Or Veth's.
SAM: Meandering Treasures? No.

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:08.232
MATT: There's Meandering Treasures, is a place you've been

00:48:08.232 --> 00:48:10.232
that might contain them.

00:48:11.173 --> 00:48:13.858
It's over in the Restless Wharf.

00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:16.078
It's another one of those general stores,

00:48:16.078 --> 00:48:21.078
part scavenge, fence kind of place.

00:48:21.301 --> 00:48:24.384
And you enter the familiar trade hub,

00:48:25.243 --> 00:48:27.326
the smell of mildewed wood

00:48:27.326 --> 00:48:31.142
and dry rot and textiles,

00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:34.749
and you do see the same male tabaxi

00:48:34.749 --> 00:48:37.924
that runs it, named Deezma Simmin,

00:48:38.797 --> 00:48:41.857
who grins through green eyes as you approach.

00:48:41.857 --> 00:48:45.921
(French accent) "Hello, and welcome to Meandering Treasures.

00:48:45.921 --> 00:48:48.395
"What can I do for you, ah?"

00:48:48.395 --> 00:48:49.657
TRAVIS: It's a pleasure to be back.

00:48:49.657 --> 00:48:52.212
My companion and I were hoping to procure

00:48:52.212 --> 00:48:56.082
some healing potions, if you might be in stock.

00:48:56.082 --> 00:48:57.832
MATT: "I might have a few.

00:48:59.564 --> 00:49:01.545
"You see, with the conflict up north,

00:49:01.545 --> 00:49:05.562
"there was a lot of importing, you would say,

00:49:05.562 --> 00:49:07.513
"so a lot of our stores ended up

00:49:07.513 --> 00:49:10.153
"being sent towards the front lines."

00:49:10.153 --> 00:49:11.314
TRAVIS: Mm.

00:49:11.314 --> 00:49:14.347
MATT: "The Empire pays quite well in times of conflict.

00:49:14.347 --> 00:49:17.742
"I do have-- let me check."

00:49:17.742 --> 00:49:19.859
He hovers off quickly

00:49:19.859 --> 00:49:24.284
and comes back with, feels like a somewhat loose satchel,

00:49:24.284 --> 00:49:27.644
pulls in two regular healing potions.

00:49:27.644 --> 00:49:31.317
"Not much to show for it, unfortunately, but

00:49:31.317 --> 00:49:33.714
"hopefully you will have some more down the road?"

00:49:34.847 --> 00:49:35.897
TRAVIS: Of course.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:49:35.897 --> 00:49:39.755
TRAVIS: It's such a shame, I was
looking to spend a lot of coin.

00:49:39.755 --> 00:49:44.530
ASHLEY: Yeah, same, my coin purse is just a little heavy,

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:45.372
I'd like to lighten it.

00:49:45.372 --> 00:49:48.190
TRAVIS: And seeing, I've sort of got that slouch going.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.023
What was that?

00:49:49.023 --> 00:49:50.557
MATT: "If there is anything else I could help you with,

00:49:50.557 --> 00:49:55.316
"perhaps I'm happy to ease this itch to spend.

00:49:56.275 --> 00:49:58.787
"Just, with this particular thing,

00:49:58.787 --> 00:50:02.733
"it is a bit, how do you say,

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.492
"hollow at the moment."

00:50:04.492 --> 00:50:06.049
TRAVIS: Sure, we are only passing through.

00:50:06.049 --> 00:50:07.698
Perhaps if you would let us know

00:50:07.698 --> 00:50:10.743
of your featured items at the moment?

00:50:10.743 --> 00:50:12.573
Things that are of particular interest?

00:50:12.573 --> 00:50:16.977
ASHLEY: Yeah, anything a little fun?

00:50:16.977 --> 00:50:18.124
MATT: "Fun?

00:50:18.124 --> 00:50:19.954
"Well, what sort of fun are you looking for, eh?"

00:50:19.954 --> 00:50:20.787
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know.

00:50:20.787 --> 00:50:24.867
Yes, featured items is probably a better way of saying it.

00:50:24.867 --> 00:50:27.724
TRAVIS: My friend does seem to
find the harder side of action,

00:50:27.724 --> 00:50:32.432
so perhaps anything that might give her an unfair advantage?

00:50:33.999 --> 00:50:35.604
MATT: "Hmm, well."

00:50:35.604 --> 00:50:38.558
And he goes back and finds this other small,

00:50:38.558 --> 00:50:41.925
like a dark stained wood, blocky chest,

00:50:41.925 --> 00:50:46.283
with some brass clasps on the sides, and opens it up,

00:50:46.283 --> 00:50:47.236
and very carefully,

00:50:47.236 --> 00:50:49.019
you could watch his whole physicality changes

00:50:49.019 --> 00:50:51.638
as he places it down and lifts the top,

00:50:51.638 --> 00:50:54.987
and very gingerly moves out these slender vials,

00:50:54.987 --> 00:50:58.806
with a rubber stopper on top.

00:50:58.806 --> 00:51:02.286
"This is a bundle of alchemical fire,

00:51:02.286 --> 00:51:07.119
"that, upon impact, will incinerate what's in the vicinity."

00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:10.101
TRAVIS: Alchemical fire?

00:51:12.771 --> 00:51:15.012
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: (yawns)

00:51:15.012 --> 00:51:19.803
ASHLEY: We do have a member of our party that can do that,

00:51:21.639 --> 00:51:24.585
just with a snap of a finger, so.

00:51:24.585 --> 00:51:27.469
MATT: "Ah, then maybe not this one."

00:51:27.469 --> 00:51:29.479
(clicks)

00:51:29.479 --> 00:51:30.678
He carefully puts that away.

00:51:30.678 --> 00:51:31.511
"Um...

00:51:36.228 --> 00:51:38.625
"I need some guidance on this. There are many things to see.

00:51:38.625 --> 00:51:42.829
"I have many outfits, I have all sorts of jewelry,

00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:45.702
"but if you're looking for things that are more,

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:49.054
"I don't know, warfare oriented--"

00:51:49.054 --> 00:51:51.544
TRAVIS: Sure, anything enchanted: rings,

00:51:51.544 --> 00:51:53.541
perhaps some small pieces of armor,

00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:57.124
anything you might've come across in trade?

00:51:59.993 --> 00:52:01.852
MATT: "The thing is, a lot of mercenaries came through

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:04.394
"and cleaned me out recently.
Let me see if I have anything."

00:52:04.394 --> 00:52:06.053
And goes into the back.

00:52:06.053 --> 00:52:07.730
TRAVIS: I don't know why we're giving him such a hard time,

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.830
you just never know.

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:10.640
ASHLEY: I don't either, I'm just following your lead.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.615
You're doing great!
ASHLEY: Am I? Okay.

00:52:12.615 --> 00:52:14.898
TRAVIS: No, it's good.

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:16.836
ASHLEY: I mean, all the things that he's been showing us,

00:52:16.836 --> 00:52:18.737
those things looked great.

00:52:18.737 --> 00:52:20.561
TRAVIS: I know, but I just feel like Caleb would be like

00:52:20.561 --> 00:52:21.469
"Why? You have me!"

00:52:21.469 --> 00:52:24.095
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well.

00:52:25.487 --> 00:52:27.110
MARISHA: Speed whisper.
TRAVIS: What if he drinks them,

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.716
and then he's like (explosion) green flame Caleb.

00:52:29.716 --> 00:52:30.549
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:34.472
MATT: Does come back excitedly, look on his face.

00:52:35.439 --> 00:52:38.320
"You are quite lucky. There is one such item

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.320
"that was put on, I would say, a distant payment plan,

00:52:43.409 --> 00:52:47.665
"but then the person has yet to arrive, in quite some time,

00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:51.175
"so if quite an entrepreneurial purchaser

00:52:51.175 --> 00:52:54.221
"were to suddenly make a delightful offer,

00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:57.010
"it could be relinquished.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:00.280
"Such things happen all the time."

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.766
Pulls up this pearlescent case, about that size,

00:53:04.766 --> 00:53:06.055
and lifts the front of it.

00:53:06.055 --> 00:53:06.940
And on the inside of you can see

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:11.806
there's this orange velvet interior,

00:53:11.806 --> 00:53:15.669
and there placed is a singular brass ring

00:53:15.669 --> 00:53:18.487
with a well-cut and polished garnet

00:53:18.487 --> 00:53:19.957
placed within the top of it.

00:53:19.957 --> 00:53:23.737
It's a little garish, but it is a thick ring.

00:53:23.737 --> 00:53:25.418
Like one of those big class rings.

00:53:25.418 --> 00:53:26.659
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

00:53:28.118 --> 00:53:33.118
MATT: "This I had acquired through my means

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.923
"about a year or so ago,

00:53:34.923 --> 00:53:39.890
"from an individual who had problems with a fiery...

00:53:42.782 --> 00:53:45.543
"debt that they had to pay.

00:53:45.543 --> 00:53:47.302
"They did not pay it,

00:53:47.302 --> 00:53:50.182
"and this helped keep them alive for quite some time.

00:53:50.182 --> 00:53:54.172
"They needed money, and pawned it onto me.

00:53:54.172 --> 00:53:57.338
"And as far as I know, without its protection,

00:53:57.338 --> 00:53:59.888
"they were not to be found again.

00:53:59.888 --> 00:54:01.395
"So."

00:54:01.395 --> 00:54:03.517
TRAVIS: That's quite the pitch.

00:54:03.517 --> 00:54:06.784
MATT: "It seems to protect from

00:54:06.784 --> 00:54:10.250
"the dangerous burning flames

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.278
"that might seek to char one to death."

00:54:14.732 --> 00:54:16.322
TRAVIS: Ring of fire protection?

00:54:16.322 --> 00:54:18.739
MATT: "A ring of fire resistance."

00:54:21.166 --> 00:54:21.999
(clicks)

00:54:21.999 --> 00:54:24.416
MATT: Does it require attunement?

00:54:26.012 --> 00:54:26.987
MATT: "I do not know,

00:54:26.987 --> 00:54:29.945
"I am not a specialist in this sort of matter."

00:54:31.132 --> 00:54:32.582
ASHLEY: So what is...

00:54:33.998 --> 00:54:36.131
What is the price for all of these things?

00:54:36.131 --> 00:54:40.104
For the little silver grenades as well?

00:54:41.303 --> 00:54:42.592
MATT: "The alchemical fire, you mean?"

00:54:42.592 --> 00:54:43.885
ASHLEY: Alchemical fire, yes.

00:54:43.885 --> 00:54:46.710
MATT: "Ah, well, let me get out my--"

00:54:48.854 --> 00:54:50.254
LAURA: (French/Tabaxi accent) My ledger.
MATT: "My ledger."

00:54:50.254 --> 00:54:51.762
ASHLEY: (French accent) Ledger.

00:54:51.762 --> 00:54:54.126
TRAVIS: (French accent) Grenade.

00:54:54.126 --> 00:54:55.567
ASHLEY: (French accent) Grenade.

00:55:00.923 --> 00:55:05.336
MATT: "They are, per flask, on their own,

00:55:05.336 --> 00:55:07.870
"about 60 gold pieces apiece.

00:55:09.158 --> 00:55:11.902
"However, if you are to do a much larger purchase,

00:55:11.902 --> 00:55:14.860
"I could throw them in for 40 each,

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:18.193
"and I have a total of 10 at my disposal."

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:22.858
TRAVIS: I don't know, just kind of fucking get them, yeah.

00:55:22.858 --> 00:55:25.564
LAURA: Yeah, what is it, 400 gold?

00:55:25.564 --> 00:55:27.484
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:55:27.484 --> 00:55:30.008
LAURA: Yeah, we just spent a fuck ton on diamonds.

00:55:30.008 --> 00:55:33.374
(laughter)

00:55:34.507 --> 00:55:38.448
TRAVIS: And for the ring, such a fantastic piece,

00:55:39.458 --> 00:55:42.142
what sort of number are you entertaining?

00:55:44.435 --> 00:55:48.785
MATT: "Well--" I'm looking up if it is indeed...

00:55:50.558 --> 00:55:52.329
Pardon me, I'll go ahead and check it out.

00:55:52.329 --> 00:55:53.389
TRAVIS: No, that's fine.

00:55:53.389 --> 00:55:54.938
MATT: Since you asked if it was attunement or not,

00:55:54.938 --> 00:55:56.588
I want to make sure you know that.

00:55:56.588 --> 00:55:59.527
It does require attunement.

00:56:00.535 --> 00:56:02.101
"This ring...

00:56:06.381 --> 00:56:09.639
"the person had it waiting for about...

00:56:11.311 --> 00:56:13.344
"5,000 gold pieces.

00:56:16.343 --> 00:56:20.843
"But with a better offer it could be relinquished, ah?"

00:56:22.702 --> 00:56:24.202
LAURA: That's a lot of money.

00:56:24.202 --> 00:56:25.791
MARISHA: That's so much money.

00:56:25.791 --> 00:56:28.117
TRAVIS: Fire resistance.

00:56:28.117 --> 00:56:31.192
Are we planning to go to any lava fields anytime soon?

00:56:31.192 --> 00:56:35.026
MARISHA: Ah man, we just did.
ASHLEY: Just did, yeah.

00:56:35.026 --> 00:56:36.434
I feel like--

00:56:41.062 --> 00:56:44.604
LAURA: Think about how much fire spells Caleb has,

00:56:45.438 --> 00:56:47.775
if we ever do fight.

00:56:47.775 --> 00:56:52.016
TRAVIS: So you can go danger close
on one of those, no problem?

00:56:52.016 --> 00:56:53.574
Oh my god!

00:56:55.197 --> 00:56:58.980
Boom, Akira bubble, we're like I'm half alive!

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.974
MATT: Akira bubble.

00:57:00.974 --> 00:57:02.010
ASHLEY: Half alive.

00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:04.103
LIAM: It's inevitable, really.

00:57:04.103 --> 00:57:05.970
MATT: We're just waiting.
MARISHA: Yeah, pretty much.

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:06.803
TRAVIS: 5,000 gold.

00:57:06.803 --> 00:57:07.961
LIAM: Achoo!
(explosion sounds)

00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:10.544
(laughter)

00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:14.395
TRAVIS: I think we're okay.

00:57:14.395 --> 00:57:16.548
ASHLEY: I think we're okay. That's a little steep.

00:57:16.548 --> 00:57:19.001
MATT: "Hey, it's not a worry."

00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:21.809
TRAVIS: It's a beautiful piece. I think
we will take the alchemical fire.

00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:22.752
ASHLEY: Yeah, for sure.

00:57:22.752 --> 00:57:24.502
TRAVIS: Just because, I mean.

00:57:24.502 --> 00:57:26.935
And both of your healing potions.

00:57:28.064 --> 00:57:29.514
MATT: "Wait, I don't--"

00:57:32.053 --> 00:57:34.722
ASHLEY: The alchemical fire, we'll take all of those.

00:57:34.722 --> 00:57:37.057
MATT: "Right, and then the two healing potions,

00:57:37.057 --> 00:57:39.672
"and you're not having the ring?"

00:57:39.672 --> 00:57:44.472
TRAVIS: I don't think so. 5,000 just feels rich.
ASHLEY: Don't think we need it, yeah.

00:57:44.472 --> 00:57:46.723
Feels a little much.

00:57:46.723 --> 00:57:49.301
MATT: "Mm, alas, I guess I'll just have to wait

00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:51.517
"for its proper owner to return, then."

00:57:51.517 --> 00:57:56.510
TRAVIS: And would you mind telling us who's waiting for it?

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:58.948
MATT: "I actually do mind, it is a privilege

00:57:58.948 --> 00:58:02.069
"between the customer and the client."

00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:06.146
ASHLEY: But what's interesting is
you were ready to give it to us,

00:58:06.146 --> 00:58:11.122
so you obviously don't care about--

00:58:11.122 --> 00:58:14.242
MATT: "I care enough to keep certain things privileged,

00:58:14.242 --> 00:58:16.372
"but I am not so ridiculous

00:58:16.372 --> 00:58:18.772
"as to not make business better, huh?"

00:58:18.772 --> 00:58:19.847
ASHLEY: Fair.

00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:23.341
TRAVIS: Now I kind of want it.

00:58:23.341 --> 00:58:25.361
Oh, no.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:58:25.361 --> 00:58:27.601
Rope-a-doping me.
LAURA: (laughs)

00:58:27.601 --> 00:58:31.034
TRAVIS: 50 gold for the name of your ring's owner.

00:58:34.772 --> 00:58:37.591
MATT: "Why are you so interested in the name of this owner?"

00:58:37.591 --> 00:58:42.441
TRAVIS: Why are you so against
the idea of 50 gold for a name?

00:58:42.441 --> 00:58:43.441
MATT: "Would you appreciate it

00:58:43.441 --> 00:58:45.281
"if after this purchase you made with me

00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:46.288
"the next person came in and said,

00:58:46.288 --> 00:58:51.288
"'I was looking for this very dangerous-looking couple.

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:52.594
"'What are they?'

00:58:52.594 --> 00:58:54.151
"And I went and told them your names?"

00:58:54.151 --> 00:58:55.811
TRAVIS: He thinks we're dangerous-looking.

00:58:55.811 --> 00:58:57.421
ASHLEY: But we did not tell you our names.

00:58:57.421 --> 00:59:00.221
TRAVIS: Oh, we didn't, did we?

00:59:00.221 --> 00:59:02.725
MATT: "No, but I'm just trying to make a point!

00:59:02.725 --> 00:59:04.291
(laughter)

00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:09.291
"I run a business by being, for the most part, reliable."

00:59:11.671 --> 00:59:13.481
TRAVIS: I'm just looking at my equipment real quick,

00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:15.463
because I don't think I can

00:59:15.463 --> 00:59:19.113
unattune from anything. (tuts)

00:59:20.712 --> 00:59:21.931
(groans)

00:59:21.931 --> 00:59:25.177
I'm attuned to the lash?! I'll take it.

00:59:27.256 --> 00:59:29.881
MATT: "What do you--"
LAURA: 5000 gold?! Sorry.

00:59:29.881 --> 00:59:31.521
TRAVIS: What if we go to hell or something,

00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:33.973
or we're, like, in the middle of a volcano?

00:59:33.973 --> 00:59:36.598
SAM: (pigeon cooing) I'm really rich!

00:59:36.598 --> 00:59:38.671
TRAVIS: You're really rich?
SAM: Yeah.

00:59:38.671 --> 00:59:40.611
TRAVIS: Buy it? Yeah.

00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:43.221
ASHLEY: What kind of deal can we do for everything?

00:59:43.221 --> 00:59:44.171
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:59:44.171 --> 00:59:46.131
MATT: "All of it together?"
ASHLEY: Because, you know,

00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:47.871
we're going to get all of it, so I'm sure

00:59:47.871 --> 00:59:52.496
we can bring the price down for the ring just a little bit.

00:59:54.341 --> 00:59:56.101
MATT: "If you were to buy it all together,

00:59:56.101 --> 01:00:01.095
"I would give you the entire lot for 5000."

01:00:06.551 --> 01:00:09.154
ASHLEY: What do you say, Fjord?

01:00:09.154 --> 01:00:12.331
TRAVIS: (sighs)

01:00:12.331 --> 01:00:13.472
ASHLEY: So...

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:17.761
MATT: "It's up to you. You can just walk away."

01:00:19.621 --> 01:00:22.901
ASHLEY: What's the price on the healing potions?

01:00:22.901 --> 01:00:26.221
MATT: "Oh, they're about 50 gold apiece."

01:00:26.221 --> 01:00:30.873
TRAVIS: So, 500 versus 5000?
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (laughing)

01:00:30.873 --> 01:00:33.629
TRAVIS: For a Ring of Fire Resistance.

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:38.293
Well, when you get mad, most things are halved.

01:00:38.293 --> 01:00:40.185
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: We do have a--

01:00:40.185 --> 01:00:41.951
ASHLEY: This ring could be for you, if--

01:00:41.951 --> 01:00:44.215
TRAVIS: Does Caleb have any sort of fire ward?
LAURA: He does.

01:00:44.215 --> 01:00:46.151
ASHLEY: (inhales)
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:00:46.151 --> 01:00:48.649
ASHLEY: He doesn't have a lot of...
LAURA: Sorry. I'm not there. I'm sorry. (laughs)

01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:50.374
ASHLEY: He's--
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

01:00:50.374 --> 01:00:52.149
LAURA: Sorry.
ASHLEY: -- very squishy.

01:00:55.501 --> 01:00:56.561
TRAVIS: We could always trade it.

01:00:56.561 --> 01:00:57.611
What is the jewel made of?

01:00:57.611 --> 01:00:59.074
Have you been able to identify it?

01:00:59.074 --> 01:01:01.306
The garnet in the middle.

01:01:01.306 --> 01:01:03.181
MATT: "It is garnet."
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a jewel-- yeah.

01:01:03.181 --> 01:01:06.072
(laughter)

01:01:06.072 --> 01:01:08.440
ASHLEY: What is the garnet?
(laughter)

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.043
SAM: What's the pearl made out of?

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:12.861
TRAVIS: In my mind it was a color and it's not.

01:01:12.861 --> 01:01:14.571
MATT: "You see, a long time ago,

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:17.711
"these elements were brought through extreme pressure

01:01:17.711 --> 01:01:20.351
"to form a celestial body called a planet."

01:01:20.351 --> 01:01:22.812
TRAVIS: I'm just a rich, dumb half-orc.

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.770
(laughter)

01:01:26.526 --> 01:01:27.774
ASHLEY: Do you want the ring?

01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:32.417
TRAVIS: Don't really feel like we need it. No.

01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:33.250
No.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:38.195
ASHLEY: Okay, so just the...
SAM: (laughs)

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:42.661
Half the episode not to buy something.
(laughter)

01:01:42.661 --> 01:01:46.371
ASHLEY: Just the silver vials and the healing potions, then.

01:01:46.371 --> 01:01:51.371
TRAVIS: I don't know. You choose!
(laughter)

01:01:51.971 --> 01:01:54.481
ASHLEY: Just the silver vials and the healing potions.

01:01:54.481 --> 01:01:56.747
MATT: "Very well." Takes the ring, puts it away.

01:01:56.747 --> 01:01:57.998
Goes ahead and packages up,

01:01:57.998 --> 01:01:59.721
and then gives you, very carefully,

01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:02.941
the box of alchemical fire, 10 vials,

01:02:02.941 --> 01:02:05.811
and the two regular healing potions.

01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:08.811
ASHLEY: And that was 400 for all of that, right?

01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:11.805
MATT: "Uh, no, that was-- 400 is--"

01:02:11.805 --> 01:02:13.261
(laughter)
Make a persuasion check.

01:02:13.261 --> 01:02:15.591
MARISHA: Yes, yes!
MATT: (laughs)

01:02:15.591 --> 01:02:17.541
LAURA: Come on, natural 20.
TRAVIS: Let's go!

01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:21.311
MATT: This has now gone into full negotiation territory now.

01:02:21.311 --> 01:02:22.956
ASHLEY: Persuasion, you said?
MATT: Yes.

01:02:22.956 --> 01:02:24.781
SAM: This is your biggest--

01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:26.264
ASHLEY: Yeah. Four.

01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:29.061
(laughter)

01:02:29.061 --> 01:02:31.269
MATT: "I apologize, but the discount

01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:32.401
"was already included as the bulk,

01:02:32.401 --> 01:02:35.841
"so it would be 500 for the..."
ASHLEY: I apologize.

01:02:35.841 --> 01:02:38.372
My math.
MATT: "It's all right."

01:02:38.372 --> 01:02:40.364
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: I have 250, you have 250.

01:02:40.364 --> 01:02:41.311
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:42.711 --> 01:02:44.364
MATT: "My pleasure. Thank you so much.

01:02:44.364 --> 01:02:47.261
"Enjoy, and be very careful with that."

01:02:47.261 --> 01:02:48.302
TRAVIS: Thank you so much.

01:02:48.302 --> 01:02:49.135
We'll be sure to stop by

01:02:49.135 --> 01:02:50.703
the next time we're in your lovely city.

01:02:50.703 --> 01:02:51.923
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: "Please. Any time.

01:02:51.923 --> 01:02:53.423
"Hopefully I have more to show."

01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:57.097
ASHLEY: Okay. Thank you very much.

01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:02.321
TRAVIS: I mean, we're not going near fire, right? It's fine!

01:03:02.321 --> 01:03:05.644
ASHLEY: I mean, we already were,
but that would be pretty cool.

01:03:05.644 --> 01:03:07.531
You know, if you wore it, and then it was like, (splutters).

01:03:07.531 --> 01:03:09.241
But you were in the middle of a fire.

01:03:09.241 --> 01:03:11.138
TRAVIS: Totally. But what if we
go somewhere where it's cold,

01:03:11.138 --> 01:03:12.383
and we're just sitting here looking at

01:03:12.383 --> 01:03:14.446
this expensive as fuck ring.
ASHLEY: Yeah. Then you're attuned to this thing

01:03:14.446 --> 01:03:16.687
and then it doesn't even do

01:03:16.687 --> 01:03:17.995
anything to help you.
TRAVIS: Nothing. Yeah!

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:20.345
You can't even eat it, or burn it.

01:03:20.345 --> 01:03:21.918
ASHLEY: I mean, you could probably eat it.

01:03:21.918 --> 01:03:24.114
You could eat anything, technically.

01:03:24.114 --> 01:03:26.514
(laughter)

01:03:26.514 --> 01:03:28.679
I think it's-- I don't think you need it.

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:29.512
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:03:29.512 --> 01:03:32.795
ASHLEY: But think about it, because
we're here for a little bit.

01:03:32.795 --> 01:03:33.911
You can always go back and get it.

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:37.247
TRAVIS: And it's weird having the money, like I-- you know

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:38.879
ASHLEY: Yeah, because you don't know
when you're going to get it again,

01:03:38.879 --> 01:03:40.431
so I sometimes--
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:03:40.431 --> 01:03:42.991
ASHLEY: But money's money.

01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:45.472
I don't know what that means.
(laughter)

01:03:45.472 --> 01:03:46.613
TRAVIS: I just felt like we were in control

01:03:46.613 --> 01:03:47.941
and then we lost it somehow.

01:03:47.941 --> 01:03:48.774
ASHLEY: Yeah, I did, too!

01:03:48.774 --> 01:03:50.541
I really felt like that was kind of cool

01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:51.661
because I was following your lead,

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.391
and I was like, oh, this is kind of neat.

01:03:53.391 --> 01:03:54.991
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: But then I felt

01:03:54.991 --> 01:03:57.192
that it all just went awry.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:03:57.192 --> 01:03:58.926
MATT: (laughs)
ASHLEY: But--

01:03:58.926 --> 01:04:01.891
TRAVIS: Hey, we got fire that we will probably never use.

01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:03.321
ASHLEY: We should not tell Caleb,

01:04:03.321 --> 01:04:04.871
and then when we're in a battle,

01:04:04.871 --> 01:04:06.124
just be like (explosion).

01:04:06.124 --> 01:04:08.081
TRAVIS: Alchemical fire.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:04:08.081 --> 01:04:09.371
I wonder what he would do.

01:04:09.371 --> 01:04:10.204
He would be like--

01:04:10.204 --> 01:04:11.841
TRAVIS: Probably be impressed, right?

01:04:11.841 --> 01:04:13.191
ASHLEY: Very!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:04:14.524 --> 01:04:15.362
Okay.

01:04:15.362 --> 01:04:16.471
ASHLEY: We should probably pass them around.

01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:17.961
TRAVIS: Good idea.

01:04:17.961 --> 01:04:20.349
No, no! This is for us!
ASHLEY: (laughs) Okay.

01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:24.098
TRAVIS: We paid for it!
(laughter)

01:04:24.098 --> 01:04:26.561
LAURA: That's a good point. That's a good point.

01:04:26.561 --> 01:04:28.631
So the only people that get any healing from the diamonds

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.811
are definitely going to be Beau
and Yasha and me and Caduceus.

01:04:31.811 --> 01:04:33.998
Yeah, because we're the only ones
that put in money for that.

01:04:33.998 --> 01:04:35.291
MARISHA: (laughs)
LAURA: Good point.

01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:36.664
TRAVIS: Well, let's not be hasty.

01:04:36.664 --> 01:04:39.111
ASHLEY: Well.
MATT: (laughs)

01:04:39.111 --> 01:04:40.676
TALIESIN: No, it's only fair.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.261
TALIESIN: It's a very good point.

01:04:42.261 --> 01:04:45.974
MARISHA: Hey, the fireworks are for all to enjoy.

01:04:45.974 --> 01:04:48.117
TRAVIS: Beau's walking around with artillery shells.

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:49.481
(laughter)

01:04:49.481 --> 01:04:51.081
And M80s.
LAURA: Big smile on her face.

01:04:51.081 --> 01:04:56.081
TALIESIN: That's what's going to make us use the diamonds.
TRAVIS: (explosions)

01:04:56.149 --> 01:04:58.366
LIAM: Fjord just got messaged from the Tal'Dorei council.

01:04:58.366 --> 01:05:01.116
(laughter)

01:05:02.201 --> 01:05:04.551
MATT: All right. Anybody else?

01:05:04.551 --> 01:05:07.481
You're heading off to...?
SAM: My condo.

01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:09.775
MATT: Okay. So, Veth,

01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:12.541
as you're rushing through the main open roadway,

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:15.911
across to the four-towered complex

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:19.551
that was pointed out by the Ruby of the Sea.

01:05:19.551 --> 01:05:21.255
SAM: Find their name on the thing.

01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:22.308
(apartment buzzer)

01:05:22.308 --> 01:05:25.174
(laughter)

01:05:25.174 --> 01:05:26.007
MATT: Um...

01:05:27.286 --> 01:05:28.454
That's not how it works, but yeah.

01:05:28.454 --> 01:05:30.324
SAM: Okay, okay.
MATT: (laughs)

01:05:30.324 --> 01:05:32.341
SAM: Buzz me in!
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:05:32.341 --> 01:05:36.789
MATT: There are a number of small, fairly nice...

01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:37.830
I wouldn't say hovels.

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.921
They're small homes that are adjoined

01:05:39.921 --> 01:05:44.791
amongst this communal-- tethered walkways between them.

01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:45.921
And as you make you way towards the one

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:49.581
that was pointed out and knock on the door,

01:05:49.581 --> 01:05:51.561
it opens up, and you see,

01:05:51.561 --> 01:05:54.931
rubbing his eyes from a dark interior,

01:05:54.931 --> 01:05:57.001
which is where you know he likes to do a lot of his work,

01:05:57.001 --> 01:06:00.481
and dealing with the immediate impact of sunlight, goes,

01:06:00.481 --> 01:06:01.724
"Uh, hello?"

01:06:02.631 --> 01:06:03.464
SAM: I throw my arms

01:06:03.464 --> 01:06:04.641
around his neck.
MATT: "(exclaims)"

01:06:04.641 --> 01:06:07.493
SAM: Give a big kiss. Hello, I'm home!

01:06:07.493 --> 01:06:09.519
MATT: At first he pulls back. He's like, "(exclaims)"

01:06:09.519 --> 01:06:11.135
"Veth. Oh my god, Veth!"

01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:13.201
And just goes right back into kissing you back.

01:06:13.201 --> 01:06:14.664
SAM: Yep, and I, yeah.

01:06:14.664 --> 01:06:16.351
I mean, we make out a little, of course.

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:19.691
MATT: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:06:19.691 --> 01:06:22.991
SAM: Where's the boy?
MATT: "Oh, uh, right in here!

01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:25.311
"Oh, it's so good to see you."
SAM: You, too!

01:06:25.311 --> 01:06:26.999
MATT: "Uh, here."

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.951
Goes and rushes inside.
SAM: Luc? Luc?

01:06:30.951 --> 01:06:33.964
MATT: "Luc was-- he was right here.

01:06:34.901 --> 01:06:37.581
"Oh no."
SAM: Oh no, what?

01:06:38.591 --> 01:06:40.777
MATT: He looks slowly over his shoulder, and--

01:06:40.777 --> 01:06:41.721
(vibrating impact)

01:06:41.721 --> 01:06:44.600
A bolt hits the ground about a foot from his feet.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.471
He's like, "(exclaims)

01:06:46.471 --> 01:06:48.436
"Don't do that!"

01:06:48.436 --> 01:06:49.721
And he comes round the corner.

01:06:49.721 --> 01:06:52.721
You can see, carrying a gathering of buttons

01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:55.171
that he's made into a necklace around.

01:06:55.171 --> 01:06:57.911
He has a little crossbow and goes, "Ha!

01:06:57.911 --> 01:06:59.875
"Mom?"
SAM: Yeah!

01:06:59.875 --> 01:07:01.661
MATT: "You see that? You see what I just did?"

01:07:01.661 --> 01:07:03.221
SAM: I didn't see it. That's the point.

01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:04.991
I didn't see you in my peripheral.

01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:06.011
You made no movement.

01:07:06.011 --> 01:07:07.861
You hung in the shadows.

01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:10.791
Top-notch work.
MATT: "Oh. Mom!"

01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:12.421
Runs in and gives you a big hug.

01:07:12.421 --> 01:07:13.338
For a second, and then pushes you out

01:07:13.338 --> 01:07:18.338
and goes, "Hey."
(laughter)

01:07:18.391 --> 01:07:19.261
"Hey, Mom."

01:07:19.261 --> 01:07:21.651
SAM: I'm so excited to see you both.

01:07:21.651 --> 01:07:23.721
I brought some presents and stuff, so here!

01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:24.963
And I pass out...

01:07:24.963 --> 01:07:28.695
I bought these matching yellow overalls.

01:07:28.695 --> 01:07:30.231
MATT: (laughs)

01:07:30.231 --> 01:07:32.674
SAM: Family overalls to wear.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:35.151
But classy, like a jumper.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:37.859
MARISHA: Yellow? Are you minions?

01:07:37.859 --> 01:07:41.251
(laughter)

01:07:41.251 --> 01:07:42.261
SAM: I just thought they'd be cute!

01:07:42.261 --> 01:07:44.559
And they're made of a really soft material.

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:47.450
You can use them as lounge wear round the house.
MARISHA: Oh, they're OshKosh.

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:49.747
SAM: Yeah! Yeah. You know?

01:07:49.747 --> 01:07:51.341
We can hang out together.
MATT: Luc's like, "Cool!"

01:07:51.341 --> 01:07:53.206
Starts putting his on immediately.

01:07:53.206 --> 01:07:55.911
Yeza's like, "All right. It's a choice."

01:07:55.911 --> 01:07:57.101
SAM: You know, it's got pockets.

01:07:57.101 --> 01:07:58.431
You can put your hammers--

01:07:58.431 --> 01:08:01.952
MATT: Much like Ralphie putting on the pink bunny outfit,

01:08:01.952 --> 01:08:04.010
he's like, "Okay."

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:05.671
SAM: I mean, I went to one store...

01:08:05.671 --> 01:08:09.320
Anyway, I got some toys and stuff.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:13.557
And yeah. So-- and, uh. Yeah. Enjoy.

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:14.621
MATT: Luc is already in the process

01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:18.251
of going through and seeing which ones are unbreakable,

01:08:18.251 --> 01:08:19.761
seeing which ones he can use to break his other toys.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.201
SAM: Uh-huh.

01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.431
MATT: But overall is just super-excited,

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.651
and he's like, "Mom, thank you so much!

01:08:23.651 --> 01:08:24.871
"Thank you so much!"

01:08:24.871 --> 01:08:27.391
SAM: No, no. It's so great to see you both.

01:08:27.391 --> 01:08:30.791
And how is it here?

01:08:30.791 --> 01:08:32.194
Does it feel-- you know?

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:33.311
MATT: "It's so cool!

01:08:33.311 --> 01:08:35.181
"It's so different from Felderwin.

01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:36.661
"There's so many different kinds of people.

01:08:36.661 --> 01:08:38.341
"It changes, like, every day!

01:08:38.341 --> 01:08:40.391
"The weather is really nice.

01:08:40.391 --> 01:08:41.671
"Get to go swimming!

01:08:41.671 --> 01:08:43.581
"There's a bunch of really nice kids in the neighborhood."

01:08:43.581 --> 01:08:45.273
SAM: Swimming? That's terrible.

01:08:46.171 --> 01:08:49.141
Or if you do, just be very careful and safe.

01:08:49.141 --> 01:08:50.741
MATT: (as Yeza) "Don't worry. I watch him.

01:08:50.741 --> 01:08:52.541
"He doesn't go off on his own."
SAM: Okay.

01:08:52.541 --> 01:08:55.661
And do you have friends?

01:08:55.661 --> 01:08:57.778
MATT: (as Luc) "Yeah! No, there's
some great kids in this area.

01:08:57.778 --> 01:09:00.181
"There's some real...

01:09:00.181 --> 01:09:03.218
"(quieter) some real <i>dicks</i> in the area."
SAM: What?

01:09:03.218 --> 01:09:04.943
MATT: Yeza's like, "What do you--?!

01:09:04.943 --> 01:09:06.441
"(sighs)"
LAURA: (laughs)

01:09:06.441 --> 01:09:08.881
MATT: (as Yeza) "Look..."
SAM: No, I understand.

01:09:08.881 --> 01:09:11.883
It's hard to keep an eye on him all--

01:09:11.883 --> 01:09:13.186
MATT: "I'm doing my best. I'm doing my best."

01:09:13.186 --> 01:09:14.461
SAM: Of course, of course.

01:09:15.721 --> 01:09:17.511
MATT: He goes on, starts telling stories

01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:18.921
about different kids in the neighborhood,

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.691
and some of adventures he's had,

01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:22.851
these small adventures that include--

01:09:22.851 --> 01:09:23.921
some of it's a lot of bullshit,

01:09:23.921 --> 01:09:25.451
or you can tell, and he's just embellishing,

01:09:25.451 --> 01:09:27.471
and some of it's just him and his friends,

01:09:27.471 --> 01:09:28.431
telling fun stories,

01:09:28.431 --> 01:09:31.095
and almost getting caught stealing from this one thing.

01:09:31.095 --> 01:09:33.011
Yeza's like, "And you don't steal!"

01:09:33.011 --> 01:09:35.101
He's like, "You're right."

01:09:35.101 --> 01:09:38.571
Looks over at you.
SAM: (laughs) I mean, if it's...

01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:39.821
If you need it.

01:09:39.821 --> 01:09:40.796
MATT: "Right? If you need it."

01:09:40.796 --> 01:09:42.411
It's like, (as Yeza) "Oh my goodness."

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:45.633
You can see Yeza's feeling like the odd man out in this one.

01:09:45.633 --> 01:09:47.181
(laughs)

01:09:47.181 --> 01:09:49.811
But eventually, you all share stories a bit,

01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:51.398
and talk about what they've been up to,

01:09:51.398 --> 01:09:53.571
and they ask what you've been up to and--

01:09:53.571 --> 01:09:56.001
SAM: Sure. Tell them the whole story.

01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:58.591
MATT: There's, from both of them--
SAM: Dinosaurs.

01:09:58.591 --> 01:09:59.424
MATT: Oh, yeah.

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:01.154
As you're telling the story,

01:10:01.154 --> 01:10:02.321
you can't help but be focused on Luc,

01:10:02.321 --> 01:10:04.111
and you can see that there's wide eyes,

01:10:04.111 --> 01:10:06.341
and he's just hanging onto every word.

01:10:06.341 --> 01:10:08.591
And then eventually, you look over towards Yeza,

01:10:08.591 --> 01:10:10.011
same expression.

01:10:10.011 --> 01:10:13.311
He is just completely enthralled and blown away by this.

01:10:13.311 --> 01:10:15.721
And when it all comes to an end, Luc's like,

01:10:15.721 --> 01:10:18.803
"You are the coolest!"

01:10:18.803 --> 01:10:21.131
SAM: (stammering)

01:10:21.131 --> 01:10:23.412
Yeah, I mean, I am. Yeah, yeah.

01:10:23.412 --> 01:10:27.949
(laughs) I am. But no, you guys are the coolest.

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:34.637
It feels much better being here with you, so.

01:10:34.637 --> 01:10:36.486
MATT: Yeza takes his glasses off and goes, "(exhales).

01:10:36.486 --> 01:10:39.161
"I'm going to be perfectly honest.

01:10:40.273 --> 01:10:44.304
"It's been a very strange year, and to think...

01:10:46.365 --> 01:10:48.171
"I don't know, this time last year,

01:10:48.171 --> 01:10:50.311
"we had no idea what was ahead of us,

01:10:50.311 --> 01:10:52.836
"and we thought we had lost you, and...

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.399
"I'm just very thankful."

01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:00.944
SAM: Yeah. Yeah!

01:11:02.106 --> 01:11:04.561
It's miraculous, really.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:09.344
Just from the depths of

01:11:11.319 --> 01:11:12.761
awfulness to this,

01:11:12.761 --> 01:11:15.741
and we have money, and we have a place,

01:11:15.741 --> 01:11:20.151
and we have friends.

01:11:21.051 --> 01:11:24.661
I mean, that's all you could want, right?

01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:26.511
MATT: "You know that's all because of you, right?"

01:11:26.511 --> 01:11:30.324
SAM: Well, yeah, I mean, and good luck, good fortune.

01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:33.334
My friends. Yeah.

01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:38.221
MATT: "Well, thank you."
SAM: Thank you.

01:11:38.221 --> 01:11:40.121
Thank you. Well, let's have dinner!

01:11:40.121 --> 01:11:42.841
MATT: "Indeed. Are your friends here as well?"

01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:45.031
SAM: Yeah. They're staying at the other place, though.

01:11:45.031 --> 01:11:47.381
I'll catch up with them tomorrow or something.

01:11:47.381 --> 01:11:49.981
MATT: "Okay, well, I guess I'll just go ahead

01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:52.470
"and prepare for a third plate. (laughs)

01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:53.303
"I need to make a quick trip.

01:11:53.303 --> 01:11:56.241
"I don't know if I have the right materials for three.

01:11:56.241 --> 01:11:57.074
"I'll be right back.

01:11:57.074 --> 01:11:58.301
"You stay with Luc."
SAM: Okay.

01:11:58.301 --> 01:12:02.543
MATT: He goes ahead and stealthily takes off

01:12:02.543 --> 01:12:06.504
(laughs) the orange jumpsuit aspect.

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:08.801
It's interesting, too.

01:12:08.801 --> 01:12:11.821
You're used to him wearing this very mousy, subtle gear,

01:12:11.821 --> 01:12:12.941
but you can see since he's been here,

01:12:12.941 --> 01:12:14.054
he's adopted a little bit

01:12:14.054 --> 01:12:18.684
of the Nicodranian styles that have come through.

01:12:20.091 --> 01:12:21.021
He's a little more tan.

01:12:21.021 --> 01:12:23.163
You're like: Oh. This is a different Yeza.

01:12:23.163 --> 01:12:24.728
SAM: (appreciative humming)
MATT: Bit of fun.

01:12:24.728 --> 01:12:26.481
But he goes off to get materials,

01:12:26.481 --> 01:12:28.131
and you catch up a bit with Luc directly,

01:12:28.131 --> 01:12:31.461
and you have a lot to talk about, both of you.

01:12:31.461 --> 01:12:32.671
For every amazing story,

01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:35.201
he has one that he tells to you as excitedly

01:12:35.201 --> 01:12:38.541
that is about how they found a rat

01:12:38.541 --> 01:12:41.101
and it was massive, and they managed to scare it off,

01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:42.690
but it's still looking for them.

01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:43.994
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: You know.

01:12:43.994 --> 01:12:46.881
All that kind of fun stuff. But yeah.

01:12:46.881 --> 01:12:51.141
As the evening draws around, you all gather again

01:12:51.141 --> 01:12:53.641
for a fantastic performance by Marion,

01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:56.861
the Ruby of the Sea, directly to you all.

01:12:56.861 --> 01:12:59.791
And even though there was an unplanned performance,

01:12:59.791 --> 01:13:00.881
word gets around quickly

01:13:00.881 --> 01:13:03.611
and a crowd does gather within the Lavish Chateau.

01:13:03.611 --> 01:13:07.141
However, premium seats are saved for the Mighty Nein,

01:13:07.141 --> 01:13:09.901
and while this performance is for all to enjoy,

01:13:09.901 --> 01:13:10.951
you can't help but feel like

01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:15.611
this is a very personal and focused performance

01:13:15.611 --> 01:13:16.911
for all of you.

01:13:18.001 --> 01:13:19.561
You're welcome to join when dinner is over

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:21.701
and bring the family, or you wish to stay with them?

01:13:21.701 --> 01:13:23.111
SAM: No, we'll just stay.
MATT: Okay.

01:13:23.111 --> 01:13:25.261
You can hear the performance from a distance,

01:13:25.261 --> 01:13:26.761
and it's nice to know it's there.

01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:28.561
There's a comfort in that proximity.

01:13:29.721 --> 01:13:31.361
And at this point, too, Yeza and Luc are talking about

01:13:31.361 --> 01:13:34.101
how they can, at this location that Marion helped them find,

01:13:34.101 --> 01:13:35.661
that they can hear the performances,

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:39.322
and numerous other musical acts that
come through the Opal Archways.

01:13:40.601 --> 01:13:42.431
It's nice to be around more culture

01:13:42.431 --> 01:13:43.853
than they're used to in Felderwin.

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:46.653
As Yeza says, "It's actually been very good for Luc, too."

01:13:47.591 --> 01:13:49.724
So it's a nice evening.

01:13:51.711 --> 01:13:52.911
Is there anything else you wish to achieve

01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:53.831
before the night is done,

01:13:53.831 --> 01:13:56.886
or do we move on to the next leg of your adventure?

01:13:59.661 --> 01:14:01.659
LAURA: Move on?

01:14:01.659 --> 01:14:02.943
TRAVIS: Is that all of us?
Matt: Okay.

01:14:04.011 --> 01:14:04.844
SAM: Hmm?

01:14:04.844 --> 01:14:06.743
TRAVIS: I'm going to go back and buy that ring.

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:09.295
(laughter)

01:14:09.295 --> 01:14:12.211
ASHLEY: I knew it!
(laughter)

01:14:12.211 --> 01:14:13.264
TRAVIS: I'm done.

01:14:13.264 --> 01:14:16.441
LAURA: This whole time you've just been--
TRAVIS: I'm dying. I'm dying.

01:14:16.441 --> 01:14:19.817
Like a fiend outside the door, knocking on the door.

01:14:19.817 --> 01:14:21.114
(laughter)

01:14:21.114 --> 01:14:22.741
TALIESIN: We're going to be in another city in 12 hours.

01:14:22.741 --> 01:14:24.326
TRAVIS: I can't let it go. I can't let it go.

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:26.151
MATT: (laughs)
ASHLEY: Get it. Get it.

01:14:26.151 --> 01:14:27.668
MARISHA: Make him tell you it was for, though.

01:14:27.668 --> 01:14:30.401
MATT: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Deezma, Deezma! I will.

01:14:30.401 --> 01:14:31.951
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: (laughs)

01:14:31.951 --> 01:14:33.501
TALIESIN: You're assuming they're open.

01:14:33.501 --> 01:14:34.334
TRAVIS: Oh, totally.

01:14:34.334 --> 01:14:36.001
He might not be there.
MATT: What hour did you go?

01:14:36.001 --> 01:14:38.421
Uh...
TALIESIN: (laughs)

01:14:38.421 --> 01:14:39.921
TRAVIS: I don't know.
LAURA: Before or after the show?

01:14:39.921 --> 01:14:42.563
MATT: How long did it take Fjord to eventually give in?

01:14:42.563 --> 01:14:43.521
TRAVIS: It was pretty quick.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.131
It was like, got down to the end of the block

01:14:45.131 --> 01:14:46.001
and was like, you know, fuck it.

01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:48.798
I'm going to go back--
(laughter)

01:14:48.798 --> 01:14:50.681
That's how most of my big purchases go in life.

01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:51.778
MATT: So make your way back in,

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:54.361
and with a surprised look on his face,

01:14:54.361 --> 01:14:57.692
goes, "Oh, back so soon, it seems?"

01:14:57.692 --> 01:15:00.351
TRAVIS: Um... (clears throat)

01:15:00.351 --> 01:15:04.141
4500, plus the name of whoever gave the ring.

01:15:10.231 --> 01:15:12.600
MATT: Looks you up and down. Make a Persuasion check.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.850
ASHLEY: Come on!
LAURA: Come on, come on!

01:15:16.868 --> 01:15:18.761
(dice clattering)

01:15:18.761 --> 01:15:20.017
TRAVIS: 23?

01:15:21.048 --> 01:15:22.256
23?

01:15:27.661 --> 01:15:29.841
MATT: "You look like a trustworthy individual."

01:15:29.841 --> 01:15:31.282
TRAVIS: Most certainly.

01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:34.751
MATT: Goes and retrieves the ring

01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:36.971
and slides it across the counter to you.

01:15:36.971 --> 01:15:38.691
I'm going to go ahead and remind myself

01:15:38.691 --> 01:15:41.534
who that ring was for real fast. (laughs)

01:15:42.813 --> 01:15:44.361
ASHLEY: (trills tongue)

01:15:44.361 --> 01:15:47.426
I'm trying to do that noise that he makes.

01:15:47.426 --> 01:15:48.451
LAURA: How do you do it? I can't do it!

01:15:48.451 --> 01:15:50.291
TRAVIS: We have a fire wizard!

01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:51.869
How can we not have it?

01:15:52.861 --> 01:15:55.336
Who has fire resistance besides you? Do you?

01:15:55.336 --> 01:15:56.169
LIAM: I don't have fire resistance.

01:15:56.169 --> 01:15:57.081
LAURA: I have cold resistance.

01:15:57.081 --> 01:15:57.914
TRAVIS: Anybody have fire resistance?

01:15:57.914 --> 01:15:59.331
LIAM: I have no resistance.
TRAVIS: Somebody does.

01:15:59.331 --> 01:16:02.421
LAURA: Well, you can set yourself to have fire resistance.

01:16:02.421 --> 01:16:03.972
LIAM: If I wanted to with my transmute stone.

01:16:03.972 --> 01:16:06.381
LAURA: Exactly.
LIAM: But like... sure.

01:16:06.381 --> 01:16:09.031
SAM: If I want to I could. Whatever.

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.614
LAURA: It's not like perfectly all the time.
LIAM: I'm so great.

01:16:11.614 --> 01:16:14.151
SAM: If I feel like it.
LIAM: I'm so over fire.

01:16:14.151 --> 01:16:16.278
ASHLEY: You should wear it like a pinky ring, you know?

01:16:16.278 --> 01:16:18.081
LAURA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: What are those called?

01:16:18.081 --> 01:16:20.661
TALIESIN: Toe ring.
LAURA: A pinky ring?

01:16:20.661 --> 01:16:24.181
SAM: A garnet?
(laughter)

01:16:24.181 --> 01:16:26.021
ASHLEY: A garnet pinky ring?

01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:27.799
TRAVIS: I looked it up, and sure enough, it says garnet.

01:16:27.799 --> 01:16:29.503
(laughter)

01:16:29.503 --> 01:16:31.141
MATT: (laughs)

01:16:31.141 --> 01:16:35.151
"The ring was originally requested

01:16:35.151 --> 01:16:39.137
"by a Lord Diedric Sutan."

01:16:39.137 --> 01:16:40.921
TRAVIS: Diedric Sutan.
MATT: "About a year ago."

01:16:40.921 --> 01:16:42.548
SAM: Sounds familiar.
MARISHA: It does sound familiar.

01:16:42.548 --> 01:16:44.836
LAURA: Does sound familiar.
MATT: "But he has not returned."

01:16:44.836 --> 01:16:47.741
MARISHA: Diedric...
TRAVIS: A year ago. Diedric Sutan.

01:16:47.741 --> 01:16:50.198
MARISHA: Wait, what?
LIAM: I don't know why.

01:16:50.198 --> 01:16:52.091
The Sutan part.
TRAVIS: Chat is going, like,

01:16:52.091 --> 01:16:54.175
"Oh, of course, Diedric Sutan! You know!"
LIAM: It reminds me of

01:16:54.175 --> 01:16:57.331
Zadash and our frame job, for some reason.

01:16:57.331 --> 01:16:58.891
And the wealthy merchant.

01:16:58.891 --> 01:16:59.891
That's where my brain's going.

01:16:59.891 --> 01:17:03.011
MATT: "He would travel here on rare occasions,

01:17:03.011 --> 01:17:04.727
"but it has been some time now.

01:17:04.727 --> 01:17:07.056
"Well, too little, too late.

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.231
"It is yours."
TRAVIS: I agree.

01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:10.241
And all to my fortune. Thank you.

01:17:10.241 --> 01:17:14.801
The name, of course, is safe with me. 4500.

01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:17.501
MATT: "Thank you for your business."
TRAVIS: Have an excellent evening.

01:17:17.501 --> 01:17:21.209
MATT: "You as well. Stay safe, and far less charred.

01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:23.609
"(laughs)"
TRAVIS: Why, thank you.

01:17:23.609 --> 01:17:26.767
It's like, it just goes over that first knuckle.

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:28.042
MATT: (laughs)

01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:29.569
TRAVIS: It's magical, right? It goes-- (buzzing)

01:17:29.569 --> 01:17:30.791
MATT: It'll shape to your finger.

01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:34.201
MARISHA: Was it back in Zadash?

01:17:34.201 --> 01:17:36.915
TRAVIS: Upon inspection of the ring--
SAM: Zadash paid.

01:17:36.915 --> 01:17:38.731
TRAVIS: -- does it have any kind of markings or language,

01:17:38.731 --> 01:17:42.861
or anything outside of just a beautifully crafted...

01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:44.271
MATT: It's beautifully crafted,

01:17:44.271 --> 01:17:45.911
though with a close inspection,

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:50.301
you can see the designed engravings around it

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:55.031
are runic elements of the enchantment.

01:17:55.031 --> 01:17:56.871
So it just looks like a very beautiful design,

01:17:56.871 --> 01:17:59.709
but with your knowledge

01:18:00.641 --> 01:18:02.861
in watching both Caleb and just what you've picked up

01:18:02.861 --> 01:18:05.901
through your pact for as long as you've been with it,

01:18:05.901 --> 01:18:07.471
you can see that hidden within it

01:18:07.471 --> 01:18:09.301
are all these various runes and engravings

01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:10.821
that are part of the enchantment that binds it.

01:18:10.821 --> 01:18:12.801
And as you place it on your finger,

01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:15.661
it seems to warm up for a second,

01:18:15.661 --> 01:18:17.861
and you almost become uncomfortable

01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:19.361
with the heat that it's acquiring,

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.761
and for a second you're like, oh, shit.

01:18:20.761 --> 01:18:22.181
I've been--
TRAVIS: Duped.

01:18:22.181 --> 01:18:23.061
MATT: -- completely duped.

01:18:23.061 --> 01:18:24.491
And then immediately it cools

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:27.108
and matches your body temperature perfectly.

01:18:28.295 --> 01:18:31.261
You were a little uncomfortable in the heat,

01:18:31.261 --> 01:18:32.981
especially with your armor and everything.

01:18:32.981 --> 01:18:34.911
Even though you're used to working along the shore,

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:37.941
you're not used to being in the seaside heat

01:18:37.941 --> 01:18:40.311
in this tropical region of the continent

01:18:40.311 --> 01:18:42.131
in such heavy equipment,

01:18:42.131 --> 01:18:43.921
and the sweating and perspiration

01:18:43.921 --> 01:18:45.191
begins to immediately subside,

01:18:45.191 --> 01:18:47.291
as you've never been more comfortable in this weather.

01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:48.211
TALIESIN: It's a goth ring.

01:18:48.211 --> 01:18:49.441
You can wear anything you want,

01:18:49.441 --> 01:18:52.075
even though it's 110 degrees.
(laughter)

01:18:52.075 --> 01:18:54.331
ASHLEY: So cool.
TALIESIN: You're living the dream!

01:18:54.331 --> 01:18:56.322
TRAVIS: Made of pure Freon.

01:18:56.322 --> 01:18:59.111
(laughter)

01:18:59.111 --> 01:19:00.331
ASHLEY: Oh, lucky.
TRAVIS: Killer!

01:19:00.331 --> 01:19:02.651
MATT: And weirdly tastes very sweet. No.

01:19:02.651 --> 01:19:05.537
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. (sucking)

01:19:05.537 --> 01:19:06.441
Antifreeze!

01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:08.051
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: That's great.

01:19:08.051 --> 01:19:09.242
Totally worth it.

01:19:09.242 --> 01:19:10.125
MATT: There you go.

01:19:10.125 --> 01:19:12.031
So you can add that to your equipment.

01:19:12.031 --> 01:19:13.211
TRAVIS: I will, and I will subtract the--

01:19:13.211 --> 01:19:15.471
LIAM: Do you want to sell it back now?

01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:16.304
TRAVIS: No, I'm good.

01:19:16.304 --> 01:19:19.541
MATT: (laughs) Immediately regrets it.
TRAVIS: No buyer's remorse.

01:19:19.541 --> 01:19:21.382
MATT: All right, so after an evening

01:19:21.382 --> 01:19:22.651
within the Lavish Chateau:

01:19:22.651 --> 01:19:25.461
a restful night. The first restful night in a while,

01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:28.261
in a very, very comfortable bed.

01:19:28.261 --> 01:19:31.161
Well-fed, well-entertained,

01:19:31.161 --> 01:19:34.624
and happy to greet a warm morning.

01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:36.487
The rest of the day is yours.

01:19:36.487 --> 01:19:38.004
Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

01:19:39.491 --> 01:19:40.549
TALIESIN: We moving on?

01:19:42.746 --> 01:19:46.463
LIAM: (sighs) Not much of a staycation.

01:19:46.463 --> 01:19:51.379
LAURA: No. I can send a message to Yussa.

01:19:52.511 --> 01:19:54.921
You know, just to remind him to keep an eye out

01:19:54.921 --> 01:19:57.331
for the Nine Eyes information,

01:19:57.331 --> 01:19:59.869
and then we can head off?

01:20:01.771 --> 01:20:02.796
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:20:04.251 --> 01:20:05.801
LIAM: Yeah.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.901
LAURA: Where would we go? We're going to Zadash?

01:20:07.901 --> 01:20:12.571
LIAM: Well, we could perhaps message DeRogna

01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:15.261
and see where in the world she is at the moment,

01:20:15.261 --> 01:20:17.961
and if she's still got work to offer.

01:20:17.961 --> 01:20:22.258
LAURA: Oh, okay, yes. Her name was Vess, right?

01:20:22.258 --> 01:20:23.928
LIAM: Vess DeRogna.

01:20:24.801 --> 01:20:26.621
It's been ages.

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:27.781
LAURA: So she had work for us,

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.272
so I basically am just going to be like,

01:20:29.272 --> 01:20:30.696
"Hey, it's us"?
LIAM: Vess.

01:20:30.696 --> 01:20:32.710
Lady Vess DeRogna.
LAURA: Okay.

01:20:32.710 --> 01:20:35.501
I'm going to send a message to Lady Vess DeRogna.

01:20:35.501 --> 01:20:36.421
MATT: All right.

01:20:36.421 --> 01:20:38.179
SAM: Lady VD.

01:20:38.179 --> 01:20:39.012
LIAM: Oh, boy.

01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:44.354
LAURA: Hey, Vess! It's Jester from the Mighty Nein.

01:20:45.201 --> 01:20:46.951
You said you had some work for us.

01:20:46.951 --> 01:20:48.901
Turns out we have some time.

01:20:48.901 --> 01:20:50.783
What is it you're thinking of?

01:20:50.783 --> 01:20:52.866
TRAVIS: It's hard, right?

01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:56.182
MATT: A moment.

01:20:57.282 --> 01:20:58.921
TALIESIN: I lost count.

01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.361
MATT: You gather you got the gist through,

01:21:00.361 --> 01:21:01.581
if you breached the--

01:21:03.331 --> 01:21:06.934
"Ah. It is nice to hear from you.

01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:12.541
"Yes, opportunities definitely remain.

01:21:15.221 --> 01:21:20.216
"Please, come visit. We can discuss in private."

01:21:24.231 --> 01:21:26.581
MARISHA: Come visit where, bitch?

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:27.567
TRAVIS: Aww, shit!

01:21:27.567 --> 01:21:28.951
(laughter)
MARISHA: What the fuck?

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:29.784
Come on!

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:33.049
(laughter)

01:21:33.049 --> 01:21:35.141
SAM: Come. To the place where I am.

01:21:35.141 --> 01:21:36.907
TRAVIS: Uh-huh!
MATT: You would--

01:21:36.907 --> 01:21:38.581
LAURA: We would know she's somewhere.

01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:40.971
Her offices were in Zadash, right?

01:21:40.971 --> 01:21:42.101
MATT: Right.

01:21:42.101 --> 01:21:43.801
You gather, from the way she said it,

01:21:43.801 --> 01:21:48.481
that if she was anywhere strange or unexpected,

01:21:48.481 --> 01:21:51.101
she would be specific.

01:21:51.101 --> 01:21:53.521
The invitation seemed to be towards her home,

01:21:53.521 --> 01:21:56.427
which you do know resides in the Candles of Rexxentrum.

01:21:56.427 --> 01:21:58.594
LAURA: Rexxentrum.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.589
LAURA: So, Rexxentrum.

01:22:05.365 --> 01:22:06.790
LIAM: Okay.

01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:07.671
LAURA: Do you want to go there,

01:22:07.671 --> 01:22:09.395
instead of Zadash?

01:22:09.395 --> 01:22:11.011
LIAM: I wanted to go to find her,

01:22:11.011 --> 01:22:13.284
so if she's home, she's home.

01:22:14.331 --> 01:22:16.971
MARISHA: I can always hit up the Reserve in Rexxentrum.

01:22:16.971 --> 01:22:20.331
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>? I don't mean to--
MARISHA: To continue research.

01:22:20.331 --> 01:22:21.461
LIAM: -- don't mean to rush things.

01:22:21.461 --> 01:22:25.631
Is there any other shopping or tasks here?

01:22:25.631 --> 01:22:27.679
TRAVIS: I'm good, boo.

01:22:28.962 --> 01:22:30.911
LAURA: Ooh, that's a pretty ring, Fjord.

01:22:30.911 --> 01:22:31.811
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: It's large.

01:22:31.811 --> 01:22:32.644
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:22:34.111 --> 01:22:35.316
TALIESIN: Think whatever shopping's left

01:22:35.316 --> 01:22:37.238
can be done in Zadash, I think.

01:22:37.238 --> 01:22:38.571
LAURA: Yeah. Or Rexxentrum.

01:22:38.571 --> 01:22:40.191
TALIESIN: Rexxentrum.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:40.191 --> 01:22:41.991
LIAM: The world is your fingerticks.

01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:43.268
Ticks?

01:22:43.268 --> 01:22:44.209
TALIESIN: That's good.

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:45.561
LIAM: The world is your fingerdicks.

01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:47.958
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Fingerdicks!

01:22:47.958 --> 01:22:50.708
(laughter)

01:22:53.006 --> 01:22:55.639
(laughter)

01:22:55.639 --> 01:22:56.986
LIAM: Let chaos reign!

01:22:56.986 --> 01:22:59.890
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:01.871
(laughter)
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:23:01.871 --> 01:23:04.191
MATT: Okay, so.

01:23:04.191 --> 01:23:06.001
Where are you off to?

01:23:06.001 --> 01:23:10.191
MARISHA: Do you think we have room in the bag of holding

01:23:10.191 --> 01:23:14.214
for a cart worth's of fireworks?

01:23:15.411 --> 01:23:17.621
TRAVIS: I have a clarifying question.

01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:21.559
A cart, or a cart of fireworks?

01:23:22.671 --> 01:23:26.661
Like, fireworks and a cart?

01:23:27.651 --> 01:23:30.101
MARISHA: Like a wheely...

01:23:30.101 --> 01:23:31.291
Here, let me show you.

01:23:31.291 --> 01:23:34.246
And I lean back and I roll out...

01:23:35.191 --> 01:23:38.213
TRAVIS: I suddenly feel much better about my purchase.

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:40.421
MARISHA: Yeah!
(laughter)

01:23:40.421 --> 01:23:41.254
TALIESIN: My god.

01:23:41.254 --> 01:23:42.789
MARISHA: I got really excited about it

01:23:42.789 --> 01:23:45.757
and then I didn't think about the practicality

01:23:45.757 --> 01:23:48.311
of transporting them.

01:23:48.311 --> 01:23:50.783
But... (scoffs)

01:23:50.783 --> 01:23:52.785
(laughter)

01:23:52.785 --> 01:23:54.735
Look at this! Look at how awesome!

01:23:54.735 --> 01:23:56.453
LAURA: It's amazing, Beau!
MARISHA: I know!

01:23:56.453 --> 01:23:58.461
ASHLEY: So cool!
TALIESIN: Fire waiting to happen.

01:23:58.461 --> 01:23:59.848
MARISHA: I mean, we could just...

01:24:01.031 --> 01:24:03.361
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

01:24:03.361 --> 01:24:05.768
I can pack a few to come with us,

01:24:05.768 --> 01:24:07.171
and then we could just leave this here,

01:24:07.171 --> 01:24:08.651
and the next time we're back in Nicodranas,

01:24:08.651 --> 01:24:11.999
we go to the beach and set them all on fire at once.

01:24:11.999 --> 01:24:13.021
LAURA: (fireworks exploding)

01:24:13.021 --> 01:24:16.261
TRAVIS: We should certainly bring some of them with us.

01:24:16.261 --> 01:24:18.131
I mean, there's a lot of room in the bag of holding--

01:24:18.131 --> 01:24:19.731
LAURA: Oh my gosh. If we pass by Hupperdook

01:24:19.731 --> 01:24:21.271
we have to give some to Kiri.

01:24:21.271 --> 01:24:22.481
I bet she would love these!

01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:23.314
MARISHA: Oh, she would!

01:24:23.314 --> 01:24:24.147
Look at these giant ones

01:24:24.147 --> 01:24:26.851
that I think shoot off balls.

01:24:26.851 --> 01:24:28.726
LAURA: Wow!
ASHLEY: Cool!

01:24:28.726 --> 01:24:30.821
TRAVIS: Look right into it.
MARISHA: And then...

01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:32.161
I don't even know what these do.

01:24:32.161 --> 01:24:34.151
ASHLEY: Whoa!
MARISHA: It's got a dragon, though.

01:24:34.151 --> 01:24:36.340
LAURA: Yeah!
MARISHA: On the front of it, so...

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:37.841
LIAM: Fjord, do you want to carry these,

01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:40.061
or do you want me to take them, or...?

01:24:40.061 --> 01:24:41.688
TRAVIS: Oh, does it affect--?

01:24:41.688 --> 01:24:43.625
You don't feel it one way or the other, do you?

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:44.958
LIAM: No.
LAURA: Do you have a maximum

01:24:44.958 --> 01:24:47.651
you can put in your thing?

01:24:47.651 --> 01:24:49.211
LIAM: About 500 pounds.

01:24:49.211 --> 01:24:50.887
TRAVIS: Tons!?
SAM: Pounds.

01:24:50.887 --> 01:24:52.823
TRAVIS: Oh.
(laughter)

01:24:52.823 --> 01:24:56.695
LIAM: Just 20 dragon turtles.
MATT: (laughs)

01:24:56.695 --> 01:25:00.728
TRAVIS: I was like, holy shit! 500 tons?

01:25:01.733 --> 01:25:03.551
Fuck me!
LAURA: There's enough room.

01:25:03.551 --> 01:25:04.571
MARISHA: Okay.

01:25:04.571 --> 01:25:05.933
MATT: Shit gets weird at 7th-level spells.

01:25:05.933 --> 01:25:07.272
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs)

01:25:07.272 --> 01:25:09.561
ASHLEY: Yeah, because fireworks are not heavy.

01:25:09.561 --> 01:25:12.031
MARISHA: No.
ASHLEY: So they could all--

01:25:12.031 --> 01:25:13.421
MARISHA: Could I fit all of them in?

01:25:13.421 --> 01:25:15.038
LIAM: You could. Do you want to hold some back

01:25:15.038 --> 01:25:18.666
so that you have a couple for a quick moment?

01:25:18.666 --> 01:25:22.531
MARISHA: I'll stash some here for next time I'm like:

01:25:22.531 --> 01:25:25.344
Oh, shit, I have all those fireworks I stashed away.

01:25:25.344 --> 01:25:27.291
LAURA: But I don't know...

01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:29.611
Okay. Just make sure that--

01:25:29.611 --> 01:25:33.280
MARISHA: I'll tell Carlos on the way out

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.741
that I'm just leaving a few crates.

01:25:35.741 --> 01:25:36.721
TRAVIS: Give some to me, too.

01:25:36.721 --> 01:25:37.831
I'll put them in the bag of holding.

01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:38.956
That way, he doesn't have to cast--

01:25:38.956 --> 01:25:39.959
LAURA: Give a couple to me, too,

01:25:39.959 --> 01:25:41.661
just so I can have them.
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:41.661 --> 01:25:43.321
Okay, yeah. I pass out some fireworks.

01:25:43.321 --> 01:25:44.996
I put some bottle rockets in my pocket.

01:25:44.996 --> 01:25:46.260
TRAVIS: Not just the sparklers.

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.385
Give me some of the big ones as well.

01:25:49.384 --> 01:25:51.555
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Whoa! (laughs)

01:25:51.555 --> 01:25:53.151
MARISHA: I know! I know!

01:25:53.151 --> 01:25:54.091
MATT: For those who'd like to,

01:25:54.091 --> 01:25:56.341
you can just add a note into your equipment

01:25:56.341 --> 01:25:57.976
of miscellaneous fireworks.

01:25:57.976 --> 01:25:59.661
TRAVIS: (laughs) Okay.
LAURA: Yeah!

01:25:59.661 --> 01:26:01.631
LIAM: I'm putting dragon firework on mine.

01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:02.661
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: All right.

01:26:02.661 --> 01:26:04.336
MARISHA: There was only two of those--

01:26:04.336 --> 01:26:05.452
LIAM: Well, I have one.
MARISHA: -- so they're special.

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:07.019
LAURA: (laughs)

01:26:07.019 --> 01:26:09.770
MATT: That one has a particular signature of its designer,

01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:12.186
Gardoff the Grr.

01:26:12.186 --> 01:26:14.931
LAURA: Gardoff the Grr?
SAM: (laughs)

01:26:14.931 --> 01:26:16.661
ASHLEY: It's like the one Pippin and Merry find.

01:26:16.661 --> 01:26:18.710
LAURA: Yeah!
ASHLEY: (laughs)

01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:19.931
LIAM: The Grr.
MATT: All righty.

01:26:19.931 --> 01:26:22.381
With fireworks distributed--
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:26.431
MATT: -- breakfast had, what would you like to do?

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.531
LIAM: Well, I'll take a quick moment

01:26:27.531 --> 01:26:29.671
to put my pieces of amber on the ground

01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:31.321
and for a moment, Fjord,

01:26:31.321 --> 01:26:33.991
you see your little ball friend--

01:26:33.991 --> 01:26:35.081
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.
LIAM: -- in the center.

01:26:35.081 --> 01:26:39.071
But then we pile all of these fireworks

01:26:39.071 --> 01:26:40.461
in a big heap in the middle

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:42.731
and it is just bulging, barely held

01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:45.711
within the dimensions of the little circle I've made,

01:26:45.711 --> 01:26:46.978
and then just-- (inhaling sharply)

01:26:46.978 --> 01:26:48.721
And all goes into the small one.

01:26:48.721 --> 01:26:49.554
TRAVIS: The Cloven Crystal.

01:26:49.554 --> 01:26:50.671
Did it look the same?

01:26:50.671 --> 01:26:53.071
Any different color, shape? Any change?

01:26:53.071 --> 01:26:55.438
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:26:55.438 --> 01:26:57.251
SAM: What was this?

01:26:57.251 --> 01:26:59.259
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:26:59.259 --> 01:27:00.601
23.

01:27:02.071 --> 01:27:03.361
MATT: No noticeable change

01:27:03.361 --> 01:27:05.891
in size or color or anything, yeah.

01:27:05.891 --> 01:27:07.031
You feel fairly confident.

01:27:07.031 --> 01:27:10.761
TRAVIS: That-- (imitating gagging)

01:27:10.761 --> 01:27:12.149
TALIESIN: Does it taste any different?

01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:13.591
(laughter)
TRAVIS: (licking)

01:27:13.591 --> 01:27:16.871
Okay, I'll put it back.
(laughter)

01:27:16.871 --> 01:27:17.811
MATT: That's how you know it's his now.

01:27:17.811 --> 01:27:19.091
He's marked it.
TALIESIN: Worcestershire.

01:27:19.091 --> 01:27:21.911
TRAVIS: I licked it.
MARISHA: Worcestershire!

01:27:21.911 --> 01:27:23.531
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Okay.

01:27:23.531 --> 01:27:25.571
LAURA: Before we head out,

01:27:25.571 --> 01:27:28.113
I just want to ask Mama,

01:27:29.072 --> 01:27:32.218
have you heard from...

01:27:37.592 --> 01:27:39.817
The Gentleman? Papa?

01:27:40.751 --> 01:27:42.851
MATT: "I do not believe I have."

01:27:42.851 --> 01:27:45.031
LAURA: No, nothing?

01:27:45.031 --> 01:27:49.247
MATT: "No. But it's also been extremely

01:27:50.314 --> 01:27:52.611
"chaotic up north."

01:27:52.611 --> 01:27:53.777
LAURA: Right.

01:27:57.131 --> 01:27:59.181
Is there anything you want to say to him?

01:28:01.231 --> 01:28:02.752
MATT: "Um, if you come across him again.

01:28:02.752 --> 01:28:05.041
"I don't know if you're heading that way.

01:28:05.041 --> 01:28:06.431
"Just tell him, maybe,

01:28:06.431 --> 01:28:09.426
"the invitation is open to come visit."

01:28:10.388 --> 01:28:11.221
LAURA: Okay.

01:28:11.221 --> 01:28:14.324
MATT: "Just conversation. Nothing expected.

01:28:15.181 --> 01:28:17.711
"Just to talk. Maybe have a glass of wine."

01:28:17.711 --> 01:28:19.721
LAURA: Okay. I'll let him know.
MATT: "No pressure.

01:28:19.721 --> 01:28:20.741
"Just make sure there's no pressure on him."

01:28:20.741 --> 01:28:22.036
LAURA: Of course, of course, of course!
MATT: "Just it's open invitation--"

01:28:22.036 --> 01:28:23.590
LAURA: I'm going to make it seem so casual, Mama.

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:26.316
MATT: "Very casual. Very casual and welcoming.

01:28:29.161 --> 01:28:31.231
"Tell him it was said very cursorily

01:28:31.231 --> 01:28:35.371
"and just offhand, like I'm disinterested."

01:28:35.371 --> 01:28:38.171
LAURA: Okay, I'll make sure he thinks you're not interested.

01:28:38.171 --> 01:28:40.311
MATT: "Right. It's just that it's a possibility."

01:28:40.311 --> 01:28:45.201
LAURA: Okay. Casually curious about how he's doing.

01:28:45.201 --> 01:28:47.492
MATT: "No pressure, no expectation."

01:28:47.492 --> 01:28:52.492
LAURA: Okay. I'll make sure to let him know.

01:28:52.701 --> 01:28:54.991
MATT: "Tell him how pretty I looked, too."

01:28:54.991 --> 01:28:59.081
LAURA: Mama. You don't have to tell me that.

01:28:59.081 --> 01:29:01.031
I tell everyone how pretty you look.

01:29:01.031 --> 01:29:01.864
MATT: "Oh!"

01:29:05.401 --> 01:29:07.032
LAURA: Okay.

01:29:07.032 --> 01:29:08.190
MATT: "Well.

01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:11.421
"Thank you all for keeping my Sapphire safe.

01:29:11.421 --> 01:29:15.581
"Thank you, my Sapphire, for keeping all of them safe,

01:29:15.581 --> 01:29:18.984
"and, well, as you know, you are always welcome.

01:29:20.231 --> 01:29:23.921
"Maybe if I have a little more forewarning next time,

01:29:23.921 --> 01:29:26.544
"I can prepare a special performance."

01:29:28.156 --> 01:29:31.081
LAURA: Ooh! Okay, okay, okay!
MARISHA: I just bought a ton of fireworks.

01:29:32.421 --> 01:29:33.921
MATT: "Good to know."
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:33.921 --> 01:29:36.536
They're stashed in the closet back behind the rum.

01:29:36.536 --> 01:29:38.153
MATT: "That seems very dangerous.

01:29:38.153 --> 01:29:39.612
"I'm going to talk to Carlos about that."

01:29:39.612 --> 01:29:42.501
LAURA: In with the alcohol? Beau!

01:29:42.501 --> 01:29:43.901
MATT: "I'll take care of it."
MARISHA: It's fine.

01:29:43.901 --> 01:29:46.544
MATT: "Nevertheless, travel safe.

01:29:46.544 --> 01:29:47.944
"Hope to see you soon."

01:29:49.526 --> 01:29:51.374
LAURA and MATT: (blowing kisses)

01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:55.901
MATT: So she sends you on your way.

01:29:55.901 --> 01:29:56.951
Where are you off to?

01:29:58.048 --> 01:30:00.631
LIAM: (exhales) Well, we could go the direct route

01:30:00.631 --> 01:30:02.391
and just use the circle.

01:30:02.391 --> 01:30:04.234
LAURA: Just do it.
MATT: All right.

01:30:05.081 --> 01:30:07.491
MARISHA: Uh, let's message the Cobalt Soul.

01:30:07.491 --> 01:30:10.716
LAURA: Oh, right.
TRAVIS: Yo, two for two!

01:30:11.581 --> 01:30:14.208
LAURA: I'll send a message.
TRAVIS: Is that growth?

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:16.528
MARISHA: That might be growth.
TRAVIS: Oh no!

01:30:16.528 --> 01:30:17.836
SAM: I assume I've caught up

01:30:17.836 --> 01:30:19.397
with you guys.
LIAM: I only cared about Yussa.

01:30:19.397 --> 01:30:21.341
She only cares about the place.

01:30:21.341 --> 01:30:23.231
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah.

01:30:23.231 --> 01:30:25.573
Together. (laughs)
LAURA: After breakfast.

01:30:25.573 --> 01:30:26.791
MATT: By their powers combined.

01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:29.071
SAM: I came and checked up on you guys after breakfast.

01:30:29.071 --> 01:30:31.091
TRAVIS: Earth!
SAM: Hey, hey!

01:30:31.091 --> 01:30:32.041
LIAM: Got to leave before she gets here.

01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:34.611
SAM: Caleb, Caleb! You said...

01:30:35.951 --> 01:30:37.621
Yesterday? No, a week ago?

01:30:37.621 --> 01:30:39.301
I don't know. Time is irrelevant.

01:30:39.301 --> 01:30:43.571
But at some point, you said soon you would be able

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:46.838
to sort of-- (popping)

01:30:46.838 --> 01:30:49.004
Bamf back and forth?

01:30:49.004 --> 01:30:51.051
LIAM: Oh, yeah. That reminds me.

01:30:51.051 --> 01:30:52.451
SAM: Is that a thing that you can do now?

01:30:52.451 --> 01:30:53.404
LIAM: Both of you.

01:30:55.631 --> 01:30:59.761
Do you have a small knickknack or something from your home,

01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:02.081
and from the Chateau that I could hold onto?

01:31:02.081 --> 01:31:04.291
LAURA: Of course!
LIAM: Something little.

01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:05.761
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Of course, of course!

01:31:05.761 --> 01:31:09.291
I'm going to run up to my room and I'm going to find one...

01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:11.131
Oh, I'm going to find a little sculpture

01:31:11.131 --> 01:31:12.812
that I did when I was very young.

01:31:12.812 --> 01:31:13.645
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:31:13.645 --> 01:31:15.771
LAURA: And it's of a little...

01:31:16.821 --> 01:31:19.096
It's a turtle, actually.

01:31:19.096 --> 01:31:20.380
TRAVIS: A turtle dick?

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.151
LAURA: No. It's before the dicks.

01:31:22.151 --> 01:31:23.331
It was a little turtle.

01:31:23.331 --> 01:31:24.951
I used to keep it on my windowsill.

01:31:24.951 --> 01:31:26.895
I was very proud of it.

01:31:26.895 --> 01:31:28.236
MATT: All right.

01:31:28.236 --> 01:31:30.936
LIAM: Okay. And may I hold onto this?

01:31:30.936 --> 01:31:31.777
LAURA: Of course.

01:31:31.777 --> 01:31:33.281
LIAM: Perfect.

01:31:33.281 --> 01:31:34.674
SAM: I have this.

01:31:36.010 --> 01:31:40.950
It's a small thong with a little Y right on the front of it.

01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:42.416
It's a small thong with a little Y right on the front of it.

01:31:42.416 --> 01:31:44.560
TRAVIS: A thong?!

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:48.420
SAM: Like a little thong underwear. Underpants.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.761
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:31:49.761 --> 01:31:53.331
Personalized lingerie?
LIAM: There's a Y on it?

01:31:53.331 --> 01:31:56.131
This is your husband's thronies?

01:31:56.131 --> 01:31:57.881
SAM: Yeah, well, he keeps one of mine

01:31:57.881 --> 01:32:00.158
and I keep one of his in our pockets.

01:32:00.158 --> 01:32:02.100
And, you know...
LIAM: Okay.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:04.151
LAURA: (groaning)
TALIESIN: (laughs)

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:07.201
LIAM: Okay. No judgments.
(laughter)

01:32:07.201 --> 01:32:08.785
Thank you.

01:32:08.785 --> 01:32:10.072
TRAVIS: Has it been laundered?

01:32:10.072 --> 01:32:11.761
LIAM: I take the turtle,

01:32:11.761 --> 01:32:14.678
and I wrap it in the thong--
(laughter)

01:32:14.678 --> 01:32:18.115
and I store them away.
MATT: Like a lembas bread bundle.

01:32:18.115 --> 01:32:20.422
(laughter)

01:32:20.422 --> 01:32:23.867
TRAVIS: (laughs) "I keep one of his, he keeps one of mine!"

01:32:23.867 --> 01:32:25.917
SAM: You know? Like a locket.

01:32:25.917 --> 01:32:27.651
TALIESIN: Sharing it with your friends is worrying me.

01:32:27.651 --> 01:32:29.821
That's really where I have a problem.

01:32:29.821 --> 01:32:31.651
ASHLEY: Turtle bundle?

01:32:31.651 --> 01:32:35.361
LIAM: Yeah. I'm still ironing out the kinks,

01:32:35.361 --> 01:32:37.321
but with those things,

01:32:37.321 --> 01:32:41.281
we should be able to go to your home and Jester's home.

01:32:41.281 --> 01:32:44.979
SAM: Like, when?
LIAM: I mean, any time.

01:32:44.979 --> 01:32:49.362
I have not tried it, but I think that I can--

01:32:49.362 --> 01:32:50.720
I think that I can do it.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.114
SAM: Like, once a day, or...

01:32:53.114 --> 01:32:54.981
LIAM: Yeah. Once or twice a day, maybe.

01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:57.502
LAURA: What?

01:32:57.502 --> 01:33:02.502
LIAM: So we can travel with a bit more ease. If it works.

01:33:02.621 --> 01:33:05.011
And if I have something specific from a place,

01:33:05.011 --> 01:33:09.401
then that makes sure that there's no unforeseen problems.

01:33:09.401 --> 01:33:11.331
There's a little, little bit of risk,

01:33:11.331 --> 01:33:12.421
depending on the place.

01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:15.482
LAURA: Does it take a lot of energy to do?

01:33:16.614 --> 01:33:17.891
LIAM: Well, it takes a lot of focus,

01:33:17.891 --> 01:33:20.461
and a lot of math is involved,

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:24.001
but once you get it down rote, you have it.

01:33:24.001 --> 01:33:25.442
LAURA: Wow!

01:33:25.442 --> 01:33:26.667
LIAM: Still haven't tested it.

01:33:26.667 --> 01:33:29.061
We could end up inside of a brick wall.

01:33:29.061 --> 01:33:31.481
LAURA: Okay. And it can bring all of us all the time?

01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:33.709
Or just a couple of us?
LIAM: All of us, yeah.

01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:38.511
LAURA: Wow. It's amazing!
LIAM: It's just building on

01:33:38.511 --> 01:33:39.711
everything I've done with the circles,

01:33:39.711 --> 01:33:41.821
except it just sort of opens that circle,

01:33:41.821 --> 01:33:43.304
and makes it wider.

01:33:43.304 --> 01:33:45.312
LAURA: Okay, so what if, say,

01:33:45.312 --> 01:33:50.312
we're traveling through Xhorhas, through the planes,

01:33:50.521 --> 01:33:54.241
and instead of camping with wild creatures at night,

01:33:54.241 --> 01:33:56.371
we can bamf here, sleep in pretty beds,

01:33:56.371 --> 01:33:59.541
and then we can just bamf back to where we were?

01:33:59.541 --> 01:34:00.891
LIAM: That is one option, yeah.

01:34:03.191 --> 01:34:04.791
LAURA: Really?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:34:05.791 --> 01:34:09.537
ASHLEY: That's pretty cool.
LIAM: Depending on our day, you know.

01:34:09.537 --> 01:34:10.571
LAURA: (gasping)
LIAM: I might need to

01:34:10.571 --> 01:34:14.931
hold onto that magic for other things, but...

01:34:14.931 --> 01:34:18.211
LAURA: Oh my gosh. That's wonderful.

01:34:18.211 --> 01:34:20.471
TALIESIN: Best to be a little
conservative with it, I imagine.

01:34:20.471 --> 01:34:21.691
SAM: Of course, of course.
LIAM: Of course.

01:34:21.691 --> 01:34:23.051
But it is nice that we can now

01:34:23.051 --> 01:34:24.331
kill two birds with one stone,

01:34:24.331 --> 01:34:28.545
because you guys are neighbors, so.

01:34:28.545 --> 01:34:29.378
LAURA: Yay!

01:34:30.361 --> 01:34:32.203
SAM: In that case,

01:34:33.948 --> 01:34:36.606
do you think I could ask you a favor?

01:34:36.606 --> 01:34:38.261
LIAM: Sure. Do you want the underwear back?

01:34:38.261 --> 01:34:39.411
SAM: No.
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

01:34:39.411 --> 01:34:40.244
SAM: No.

01:34:41.941 --> 01:34:43.308
Do you think you guys could go

01:34:43.308 --> 01:34:45.784
and just come get me tomorrow or something?

01:34:46.791 --> 01:34:51.791
I've just been home for, like, one night, and it just...

01:34:52.081 --> 01:34:54.652
I don't know.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:34:54.652 --> 01:34:56.471
MARISHA: We could also just stay another night.

01:34:58.026 --> 01:34:59.876
SAM: I don't to hold you guys up, but...

01:35:01.925 --> 01:35:04.128
LIAM: You want one more night?

01:35:04.128 --> 01:35:05.221
SAM: Yeah, but we have stuff to do.

01:35:05.221 --> 01:35:08.181
TRAVIS: Well, we have research to do.
LIAM: We have lots of things to do.

01:35:08.181 --> 01:35:09.898
SAM: You could start researching.

01:35:09.898 --> 01:35:11.221
I'm not a good researcher,

01:35:11.221 --> 01:35:12.941
if you want to just start without me.

01:35:12.941 --> 01:35:16.211
TRAVIS: We could come back.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:19.769
I mean, if your spells are doable.

01:35:19.769 --> 01:35:22.819
I mean, if your spells are doable.

01:35:22.819 --> 01:35:24.571
Why not?

01:35:24.571 --> 01:35:28.791
LIAM: If you want to take it for a whirl? Okay.

01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:29.871
Stay. We'll go.

01:35:29.871 --> 01:35:33.574
We'll take in the greatest city in the world.

01:35:37.018 --> 01:35:38.791
And he just starts drawing

01:35:38.791 --> 01:35:40.591
on the ground.
LAURA: Oh, gosh.

01:35:40.591 --> 01:35:44.081
MARISHA: If you could send a message to Archivist Kathedoc.

01:35:44.081 --> 01:35:46.041
LAURA: Archivist Kathedoc.

01:35:46.041 --> 01:35:47.691
I remember them.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:35:47.691 --> 01:35:49.301
MATT: So heading to Rexxentrum is the intent here?

01:35:49.301 --> 01:35:50.618
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

01:35:50.618 --> 01:35:52.848
LAURA: I send a message. Fjord, help me.

01:35:52.848 --> 01:35:54.771
To Archivist Kathedoc.

01:35:54.771 --> 01:35:56.502
LIAM: This time, not riding on horses.

01:35:56.502 --> 01:36:00.156
MATT: (laughs) Yes.
LAURA: Oh, Archivist Kathedoc!

01:36:00.156 --> 01:36:03.041
We are on our way to the

01:36:05.591 --> 01:36:07.871
teleportation circle

01:36:07.871 --> 01:36:09.561
within your...

01:36:11.289 --> 01:36:12.314
MARISHA: Library.

01:36:12.314 --> 01:36:14.431
LAURA: Library.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:36:14.431 --> 01:36:17.547
LAURA: Okay, see you soon. Can't wait for the--

01:36:17.547 --> 01:36:20.321
MARISHA: We're the Mighty Nein.
LAURA: We're the Mighty Nein!

01:36:20.321 --> 01:36:22.012
MARISHA: Coming with Beau. Okay.

01:36:22.012 --> 01:36:25.511
(laughter)

01:36:25.511 --> 01:36:27.951
MATT: Eventually, rather quickly...

01:36:27.951 --> 01:36:30.597
(laughter)

01:36:30.597 --> 01:36:33.916
TRAVIS: Who we are, why--
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:36:33.916 --> 01:36:38.641
MATT: "I greatly appreciate your giving us forenotice.

01:36:40.391 --> 01:36:43.231
"We shall prepare for your arrival."

01:36:44.249 --> 01:36:47.601
That's it.
LAURA: They're preparing for our arrival.

01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:51.074
MARISHA: Of course they are.
TALIESIN: Sounds ominous.

01:36:52.281 --> 01:36:54.635
MARISHA: It should be.
MATT: All right.

01:36:54.635 --> 01:36:56.087
TRAVIS: Veth, be safe.

01:36:57.121 --> 01:37:02.121
SAM: I think I'm in a much safer place
than you're going to be.

01:37:02.651 --> 01:37:05.411
TRAVIS: Sure, I think we've just all been
together for so long,

01:37:05.411 --> 01:37:07.637
so it just feels a bit odd.

01:37:09.051 --> 01:37:11.552
SAM: Yeah. But you're going to come get me, like, tomorrow.

01:37:11.552 --> 01:37:12.627
LIAM: We'll be back in no time.
SAM: Yeah!

01:37:12.627 --> 01:37:14.631
TRAVIS: Do you have a way to reach out to Caleb or someone

01:37:14.631 --> 01:37:16.681
if something happens, or...?

01:37:16.681 --> 01:37:19.131
SAM: In a pinch, I could go to Yussa,

01:37:19.131 --> 01:37:23.561
and I assume he could reach out.

01:37:23.561 --> 01:37:25.731
LAURA: I'll make sure to send you a message tomorrow.

01:37:25.731 --> 01:37:26.564
SAM: Great.
LAURA: And that way

01:37:26.564 --> 01:37:27.804
you can let me know how it's going.

01:37:27.804 --> 01:37:28.961
SAM: Great. Perfect, yes.

01:37:28.961 --> 01:37:30.651
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Yeah.

01:37:30.651 --> 01:37:33.461
You guys going to be okay in Rexxentrum

01:37:33.461 --> 01:37:34.711
wearing these clothes?

01:37:34.711 --> 01:37:37.424
These Xhorhasian clothes? You'll be okay?

01:37:37.424 --> 01:37:41.301
TALIESIN: I've already changed,
just because it's been so hot lately.

01:37:41.301 --> 01:37:42.171
LAURA: I hadn't thought much about--

01:37:42.171 --> 01:37:45.311
LIAM: I can take care of our first day, with your clothes.

01:37:45.311 --> 01:37:49.511
MARISHA: I'll put back on my Cobalt gear.

01:37:49.511 --> 01:37:51.331
TRAVIS: Mask of Many Faces.

01:37:51.331 --> 01:37:54.571
LAURA: I mean, I've got my high priestess dress on,

01:37:54.571 --> 01:37:55.404
technically.

01:37:55.404 --> 01:37:58.047
TALIESIN: I could pick up something once we're there,

01:37:58.047 --> 01:37:59.447
but I can take off the coat.

01:38:00.911 --> 01:38:03.408
SAM: If you want some overalls, there's this great place.

01:38:03.408 --> 01:38:05.161
(laughter)

01:38:05.161 --> 01:38:07.501
LAURA: Really cool.
I love those overalls.

01:38:07.501 --> 01:38:08.721
Which store was it?

01:38:08.721 --> 01:38:12.028
SAM: It was called, uh... Ollie's Overalls.

01:38:12.028 --> 01:38:14.293
(laughter)
LAURA: Oh, Ollie's Overalls!

01:38:14.293 --> 01:38:16.141
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great store.

01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:18.431
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah. Lots of pockets.

01:38:18.431 --> 01:38:19.441
SAM: Yeah. So many.

01:38:19.441 --> 01:38:20.618
There's a side one here.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:38:20.618 --> 01:38:21.911
TALIESIN: Did you actually meet Ollie,

01:38:21.911 --> 01:38:23.386
or was it just someone who works for him?

01:38:23.386 --> 01:38:24.719
SAM: I stole them.
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:38:24.719 --> 01:38:27.421
(laughter)

01:38:27.421 --> 01:38:29.355
TRAVIS: Out of the window.
MATT: All right.

01:38:29.355 --> 01:38:31.271
LIAM: (whooshing)
MATT: As you finish the circle,

01:38:31.271 --> 01:38:36.190
you watch as the multiple layers of glyph sketching connect

01:38:36.190 --> 01:38:38.361
you watch as the multiple layers of glyph sketching connect

01:38:38.361 --> 01:38:42.621
and it spirals out like the slowly dispersing elements

01:38:42.621 --> 01:38:45.951
of a light cable that continues to swirl

01:38:45.951 --> 01:38:47.011
and fill out on its own right,

01:38:47.011 --> 01:38:51.011
like lighting a long-drawn fuel glyph.

01:38:51.011 --> 01:38:52.731
Suddenly, it ignites.

01:38:52.731 --> 01:38:55.161
And as it does, it brightens, and that familiar moment hits

01:38:55.161 --> 01:38:58.501
where you realize you have but seconds to charge through.

01:38:58.501 --> 01:39:00.750
And so you, Veth, watch as your friends--

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:02.271
(whooshing)

01:39:02.271 --> 01:39:04.182
all vanish into the circle before it...

01:39:04.182 --> 01:39:05.604
(soft whooshing)

01:39:05.604 --> 01:39:07.371
Its energy disperses, and it is gone,

01:39:07.371 --> 01:39:10.131
and you're left alone with your family.

01:39:10.131 --> 01:39:11.957
SAM: I run back to 'em.

01:39:11.957 --> 01:39:14.164
We make reservations at an outdoor cafe.

01:39:14.164 --> 01:39:17.191
(laughter)

01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:18.501
MATT: Well, first, roll persuasion

01:39:18.501 --> 01:39:19.701
to see how good the seating is.

01:39:19.701 --> 01:39:20.986
SAM: Oh. Okay, okay.

01:39:20.986 --> 01:39:23.083
LIAM: By the way, that is high fantasy in 2020.

01:39:23.083 --> 01:39:25.078
MARISHA: Yeah, it is!
TRAVIS: Yeah, it really is.

01:39:25.078 --> 01:39:26.161
LIAM: Going to a restaurant.
SAM: Persuasion?

01:39:26.161 --> 01:39:28.151
TRAVIS: They're like, "Oh!"
TRAVIS: Plus three?

01:39:28.151 --> 01:39:28.984
How did that happen?

01:39:28.984 --> 01:39:31.091
Whoa, 22!
LAURA: What?

01:39:31.091 --> 01:39:34.585
MATT: You get amazing seats for you and your family.

01:39:34.585 --> 01:39:35.611
(laughs)

01:39:35.611 --> 01:39:39.014
Incredible ocean view. The best server.

01:39:39.014 --> 01:39:42.631
SAM: Ceviche.
(laughter)

01:39:42.631 --> 01:39:43.901
MARISHA: Fuck, that sounds good.

01:39:43.901 --> 01:39:47.321
MATT: As you guys arrive in the familiar basement

01:39:47.321 --> 01:39:50.671
beneath the Rexxentrum Archive of the Cobalt Soul,

01:39:50.671 --> 01:39:52.341
you are greeted by

01:39:52.341 --> 01:39:57.341
the familiar older, white-haired half-orc visage

01:39:57.411 --> 01:39:59.251
of Archivist Kathedoc

01:39:59.251 --> 01:40:01.931
and one of the other guards there sitting,

01:40:01.931 --> 01:40:03.591
steps forward.

01:40:03.591 --> 01:40:08.051
(as Kathedoc) "All right. You've arrived, it is a pleasure.

01:40:08.051 --> 01:40:12.631
"Come. The archive is yours, Expositor."

01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:14.071
MARISHA: Thank you, Archivist.

01:40:14.071 --> 01:40:16.991
Do you know if the High Curator is in?

01:40:16.991 --> 01:40:18.281
MATT: "Indeed."
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:40:18.281 --> 01:40:20.061
MATT: "Would you wish to speak to them?"

01:40:20.061 --> 01:40:22.161
MARISHA: Yeah, if they're around.

01:40:22.161 --> 01:40:25.091
MATT: "Very well, then, follow me."
MARISHA: All right.

01:40:25.091 --> 01:40:26.741
Uh, Caleb, come with me.

01:40:26.741 --> 01:40:31.249
MATT: Steps up, his robe's dragging on
the steps as he makes his way up.

01:40:31.249 --> 01:40:33.021
Once again-- you were in a bit of a rush

01:40:33.021 --> 01:40:34.741
last time you guys got here.

01:40:34.741 --> 01:40:37.571
Your last experience in Rexxentrum,

01:40:37.571 --> 01:40:39.331
especially you, Yasha,

01:40:39.331 --> 01:40:42.231
was under a certain level of duress.

01:40:42.231 --> 01:40:44.464
But as you walk back up the stairs--

01:40:44.464 --> 01:40:46.914
this'd actually be the first time you've seen it.

01:40:47.881 --> 01:40:52.881
This library is massive, and gorgeous.

01:40:53.281 --> 01:40:55.331
TALIESIN: This wasn't the one they attacked, was it?

01:40:55.331 --> 01:40:56.261
MARISHA: No, that was Zadash.

01:40:56.261 --> 01:40:58.811
MATT: No, but it is in the vicinity.

01:40:58.811 --> 01:41:00.641
This is where you arrived last time

01:41:00.641 --> 01:41:02.724
during the mounting attack.

01:41:03.621 --> 01:41:04.601
But looking up, you can see

01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:07.881
the beautiful skylights of cerulean glass

01:41:07.881 --> 01:41:09.656
that colors all the light that comes in

01:41:09.656 --> 01:41:11.291
with this faint blue hue,

01:41:11.291 --> 01:41:14.961
and at moments it almost seems to shift to purple in spaces.

01:41:14.961 --> 01:41:17.911
You can see tier upon tier upon tier

01:41:17.911 --> 01:41:22.131
of a three- to four-story, in some places, library.

01:41:22.131 --> 01:41:26.241
Each story is a 12-foot plus shelf of books

01:41:26.241 --> 01:41:29.821
of all sizes and colors and ages.

01:41:29.821 --> 01:41:32.251
These areas, these railings, are open

01:41:32.251 --> 01:41:33.601
to leave this large atrium

01:41:33.601 --> 01:41:35.301
in the center of this library,

01:41:35.301 --> 01:41:36.721
like a giant horseshoe shape

01:41:36.721 --> 01:41:40.963
where this massive stacked library sits around,

01:41:40.963 --> 01:41:44.838
and the stonework has this beautiful gray-blue hue to it,

01:41:44.838 --> 01:41:47.431
the floor this stunning marble, polished.

01:41:47.431 --> 01:41:49.871
And throughout it there are small bursts of fern

01:41:49.871 --> 01:41:52.171
and potted plants that give a burst of life and color

01:41:52.171 --> 01:41:53.671
to the interior.

01:41:53.671 --> 01:41:55.921
The smell is clean and kept.

01:41:55.921 --> 01:41:58.301
This is a beautiful place,

01:41:58.301 --> 01:42:00.911
and it's not very populated.

01:42:00.911 --> 01:42:01.981
You can see there are a few individuals

01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:05.081
that are making their way through the various archives,

01:42:05.081 --> 01:42:06.141
each one accompanied

01:42:06.141 --> 01:42:10.521
by one of the various curators of the library,

01:42:10.521 --> 01:42:12.701
as no one is to be left unattended.

01:42:12.701 --> 01:42:15.491
And this is but one section of the library,

01:42:15.491 --> 01:42:17.441
but it is the one you are at.

01:42:17.441 --> 01:42:19.356
As you are brought to the atrium,

01:42:19.356 --> 01:42:23.204
Kathedoc wanders off for a moment,

01:42:23.204 --> 01:42:24.951
and a few moments later returns

01:42:24.951 --> 01:42:26.191
with a familiar figure.

01:42:26.191 --> 01:42:30.251
You see the half-elven individual

01:42:30.251 --> 01:42:32.271
that you met in the throne room, briefly,

01:42:32.271 --> 01:42:33.761
or saw in the throne room

01:42:33.761 --> 01:42:37.911
while you were speaking to King Dwendal himself.

01:42:37.911 --> 01:42:42.781
This is the High Curator Yudala Fon
of the Rexxentrum Archive.

01:42:42.781 --> 01:42:45.881
As they approach,

01:42:45.881 --> 01:42:48.839
giving a quick glance over your troupe,

01:42:48.839 --> 01:42:51.821
beelines towards Beauregard,

01:42:51.821 --> 01:42:55.141
and in their long, beautifully elegant,

01:42:55.141 --> 01:42:59.071
white gold with blue trim robes,

01:42:59.071 --> 01:43:02.411
heavy, looks like at first just adornment jewelry,

01:43:02.411 --> 01:43:03.861
but you can see within it,

01:43:03.861 --> 01:43:07.011
each has a bit of scripture

01:43:07.011 --> 01:43:11.996
that is rolled up onto it and sealed within a glass case.

01:43:11.996 --> 01:43:13.601
These are reliquaries of some kind

01:43:13.601 --> 01:43:17.942
that are worn in a ceremonial way

01:43:17.942 --> 01:43:21.300
by the High Curator.

01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.461
As Yudala approaches Beauregard

01:43:23.461 --> 01:43:25.781
and gives a nod.

01:43:25.781 --> 01:43:28.091
The short red fiery hair

01:43:28.091 --> 01:43:31.931
just barely catching the right eye.

01:43:31.931 --> 01:43:33.446
They smile, and...

01:43:34.356 --> 01:43:37.814
"Beauregard Lionett. Yes?"
MARISHA: Yes.

01:43:37.814 --> 01:43:40.571
MATT: "Expositor of the Zadash Archive."

01:43:40.571 --> 01:43:42.571
MARISHA: Yeah. Damn, your memory's great.

01:43:42.571 --> 01:43:47.571
Yeah. Yudala Fon, High Curator.

01:43:47.791 --> 01:43:49.057
Thank you so much for seeing us.

01:43:49.057 --> 01:43:50.951
I'm sorry it's such short notice.

01:43:50.951 --> 01:43:54.810
MATT: "Of course. I have not had an opportunity yet

01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:59.451
"to thank you for what you aided in not long ago."

01:43:59.451 --> 01:44:02.276
"to thank you for what you aided in not long ago."

01:44:02.276 --> 01:44:04.751
MARISHA: Yeah, it was a bit chaotic
last time we came through.

01:44:04.751 --> 01:44:07.211
MATT: "Indeed."
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:44:07.211 --> 01:44:09.046
MATT: "No need to apologize."

01:44:09.046 --> 01:44:12.991
MARISHA: How's the damage to the city? Doing better?

01:44:12.991 --> 01:44:15.621
MATT: "The city has seen far worse before.

01:44:15.621 --> 01:44:19.531
"This was thankfully kept to a minimum

01:44:19.531 --> 01:44:24.472
"because of the expeditious arrival of you and your friends,

01:44:24.472 --> 01:44:25.480
"because of the expeditious arrival of you and your friends,

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.111
"and the warnings that you had given in advance.

01:44:29.111 --> 01:44:30.411
"It seems that the..."

01:44:30.411 --> 01:44:33.666
And you see they think for a moment.

01:44:35.031 --> 01:44:38.439
"In reading your files,

01:44:39.501 --> 01:44:44.501
"there is much spoken highly from Dairon of your work."

01:44:44.631 --> 01:44:46.558
MARISHA: Oh, ah... (laughs)

01:44:46.558 --> 01:44:49.901
I didn't expect anything less. Great!

01:44:49.901 --> 01:44:52.351
MATT: "Along with quite a layer of impetuousness."

01:44:52.351 --> 01:44:55.081
MARISHA: Uh, that tracks.

01:44:55.081 --> 01:44:57.211
MATT: "Which is not always a bad thing."

01:44:57.211 --> 01:44:59.221
MARISHA: That's what Dairon said.

01:44:59.221 --> 01:45:01.494
I think it's been working out, you know?

01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:05.731
Yeah.
MATT: "You seem to have a crew here

01:45:05.731 --> 01:45:08.432
"that keeps a good head on your shoulders."

01:45:09.621 --> 01:45:14.619
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. They keep me alive and somewhat sane.

01:45:16.241 --> 01:45:18.148
I'd like to think that I do that for them, too,

01:45:18.148 --> 01:45:20.121
but yeah, I mean, you know, it's hard to say.

01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:22.081
Yeah.
MATT: "I'm excited to see

01:45:22.915 --> 01:45:25.165
"how much you will continue to grow from here.

01:45:26.031 --> 01:45:28.656
"I'm already extremely impressed."

01:45:30.081 --> 01:45:32.579
MARISHA: Oh, thank you.

01:45:34.171 --> 01:45:39.151
MATT: "You're... (hums)"
MARISHA: What?

01:45:39.151 --> 01:45:42.929
MATT: "This is not an expositor's outfit."

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:46.661
MARISHA: Well, you see, we've, um...

01:45:47.831 --> 01:45:51.921
kind of ping-ponged to a bunch of places really quickly.

01:45:51.921 --> 01:45:56.191
We just got back from the middle of the Lucidian Ocean,

01:45:56.191 --> 01:45:57.924
like, yesterday.
MATT: (humming)

01:45:57.924 --> 01:46:01.411
MARISHA: So, yeah. Sorry.

01:46:01.411 --> 01:46:02.244
MATT: "It's all right.

01:46:02.244 --> 01:46:04.601
"It just might be difficult.

01:46:04.601 --> 01:46:06.201
"You may find yourself challenged

01:46:06.201 --> 01:46:09.131
"if you're not wearing the clothing of your station.

01:46:09.131 --> 01:46:09.981
"Do you require one?"

01:46:09.981 --> 01:46:12.134
MARISHA: Oh, I've said I put on
my robes before I came for...

01:46:12.134 --> 01:46:13.610
MATT: I thought you said you put on your original one.

01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:15.753
My apologies. Well--

01:46:15.753 --> 01:46:18.488
MARISHA: I put on my expositor gear.
MATT: Got it.

01:46:18.488 --> 01:46:20.894
TRAVIS: Wear your gear.
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

01:46:20.894 --> 01:46:22.365
TALIESIN: Some of us--
MARISHA: I got it. I got it.

01:46:22.365 --> 01:46:23.694
But the rest of them, I don't know.

01:46:23.694 --> 01:46:24.615
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Can't account for them.

01:46:24.615 --> 01:46:28.161
MATT: No one should notice. "Regardless,
you requested my presence.

01:46:28.161 --> 01:46:31.371
"What can, hopefully, the Archive help with?"

01:46:33.161 --> 01:46:37.669
MARISHA: Yeah. We crossed paths with

01:46:38.869 --> 01:46:41.527
something beyond this realm.

01:46:41.527 --> 01:46:44.744
Quite, quite beyond this realm.

01:46:45.661 --> 01:46:50.361
An Abyssal creature from the Astral Sea.

01:46:50.361 --> 01:46:52.191
MATT: "Abyssal, but from the Astral Sea?"

01:46:52.191 --> 01:46:55.141
MARISHA: I don't know. I don't know if that's the right...

01:46:55.141 --> 01:46:56.588
He came from the Astral Sea.

01:46:56.588 --> 01:46:58.781
LAURA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: It.

01:46:58.781 --> 01:47:01.101
MARISHA: It, yeah. Whatever it was.

01:47:01.101 --> 01:47:03.527
Who went by the name Vokodo,

01:47:04.391 --> 01:47:09.047
and crash-landed on the island of Rexxentrum.

01:47:09.047 --> 01:47:11.755
LAURA: No, Rumblecusp.
MARISHA: In the middle of Rumblecusp.

01:47:11.755 --> 01:47:14.527
We are in Rexxentrum, thank you.

01:47:14.527 --> 01:47:15.971
MATT: You see Yudala trying to follow.

01:47:15.971 --> 01:47:16.841
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:47:16.841 --> 01:47:18.466
MATT: "All right."
(laughter)

01:47:18.466 --> 01:47:21.472
MARISHA: I said Rumblecusp.
MATT: "What was this creature?"

01:47:23.341 --> 01:47:24.691
MARISHA: What was this creature?

01:47:24.691 --> 01:47:26.471
LAURA: He was, like, a big fire creature

01:47:26.471 --> 01:47:28.381
that looked like dried magma.

01:47:28.381 --> 01:47:30.781
So, fire poking out, and he had lots of arms,

01:47:30.781 --> 01:47:32.136
and he lived underwater.

01:47:32.136 --> 01:47:34.561
TALIESIN: Also shadow and--
LAURA: Yeah.

01:47:34.561 --> 01:47:36.951
TALIESIN: Difficult to see.
TRAVIS: Tendrils. A few eyes.

01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:38.791
Four eyes?
LIAM: Four eyes, yeah.

01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:42.291
TALIESIN: Vokodo's entry into our plane of existence

01:47:42.291 --> 01:47:43.751
shattered it where he fell.

01:47:43.751 --> 01:47:47.711
There were fragments of different planes

01:47:47.711 --> 01:47:48.901
all across the island,

01:47:48.901 --> 01:47:50.561
like he had broken something.

01:47:50.561 --> 01:47:55.561
MARISHA: We all had this vision as we beat him

01:47:55.561 --> 01:48:00.561
of him fleeing a giant, moving city in the Astral Sea,

01:48:02.481 --> 01:48:05.089
and the phrase...

01:48:06.179 --> 01:48:09.541
TALIESIN: Nine eyes.
MARISHA: The nine eyes,

01:48:09.541 --> 01:48:12.954
more or less manifested in all of our consciousness.

01:48:13.831 --> 01:48:16.691
LAURA: When she says a moving, living city,

01:48:16.691 --> 01:48:19.421
it was, like, the most terrifying,

01:48:19.421 --> 01:48:21.591
horrible moving, living city

01:48:21.591 --> 01:48:23.411
you could ever imagine, you know?

01:48:23.411 --> 01:48:27.461
Like, it felt like the buildings were organic,

01:48:27.461 --> 01:48:30.221
thinking and moving on their own.

01:48:30.221 --> 01:48:32.511
TALIESIN: Bleeding.
LAURA: Breathing!

01:48:32.511 --> 01:48:33.941
It felt like they were breathing.

01:48:33.941 --> 01:48:37.521
LIAM: And the phrase was, "Eyes of nine."
MARISHA: "Eyes of nine."

01:48:37.521 --> 01:48:38.696
LIAM: Specifically.

01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:44.656
MATT: "That is disquieting to say the least.

01:48:46.041 --> 01:48:49.992
"And you require research assistance in this, yes?"

01:48:49.992 --> 01:48:51.011
MARISHA: Yes.

01:48:51.011 --> 01:48:53.471
MATT: "I will get my best scholars on it."

01:48:53.471 --> 01:48:54.304
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:48:54.304 --> 01:48:55.391
MATT: "Do we have means of contacting you,

01:48:55.391 --> 01:48:56.841
"should we find anything?"

01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.436
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
MATT: "Very well."

01:49:00.436 --> 01:49:05.019
MARISHA: Should contact her. Or, well, she can contact...

01:49:05.019 --> 01:49:07.181
LAURA: You can respond to messages.
MARISHA: I can respond to messages.

01:49:07.181 --> 01:49:08.921
You can contact me, yeah.

01:49:08.921 --> 01:49:10.116
MATT: "Then we will continue it then."

01:49:10.116 --> 01:49:12.021
MARISHA: Then she can contact you back, yeah.

01:49:12.021 --> 01:49:14.867
MATT: "Of course."
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:49:14.867 --> 01:49:16.101
MATT: "Well, I will get onto this.

01:49:16.101 --> 01:49:17.621
"I do have business to attend to.

01:49:17.621 --> 01:49:20.188
"It is a pleasure to see all of you,

01:49:20.188 --> 01:49:23.812
"and Beauregard Lionett."

01:49:23.812 --> 01:49:24.671
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:49:24.671 --> 01:49:26.721
LAURA: Thank you, High Curator,

01:49:26.721 --> 01:49:31.652
for your wonderful time spent with us.

01:49:31.652 --> 01:49:34.811
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: "(uncertain chuckle)

01:49:34.811 --> 01:49:37.069
"The pleasure is mine."

01:49:38.421 --> 01:49:40.951
Bows lower, like--
LAURA: (laughs)

01:49:40.951 --> 01:49:43.034
MATT: Trying to follow.

01:49:43.034 --> 01:49:45.251
"(hums) All right."

01:49:45.251 --> 01:49:48.041
And they immediately turn and (laughs)

01:49:48.041 --> 01:49:49.821
march off to their business

01:49:49.821 --> 01:49:52.041
as you watch them begin to point out

01:49:52.041 --> 01:49:53.931
and call over a few individuals

01:49:53.931 --> 01:49:55.531
and essentially begin prepping them

01:49:55.531 --> 01:49:59.941
on what is the requested intent of your arrival.

01:49:59.941 --> 01:50:01.181
MARISHA: Cool.

01:50:01.181 --> 01:50:03.146
LAURA: Expositors are really powerful, huh?

01:50:03.146 --> 01:50:05.861
MARISHA: (sighs) Yeah. They make me nervous every time.

01:50:05.861 --> 01:50:06.694
Even though, like...

01:50:06.694 --> 01:50:08.091
You know I don't really care about authority,

01:50:08.091 --> 01:50:09.820
but it's still, like, a lot.

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:14.081
LAURA: Beau. You are authority.
MARISHA: I know. It's weird, right?

01:50:14.081 --> 01:50:18.098
ASHLEY: Are you equal with him?
MARISHA: No, no, no, no.

01:50:19.621 --> 01:50:22.646
They are the lead,

01:50:22.646 --> 01:50:25.937
kind of like the master of this branch.

01:50:25.937 --> 01:50:28.919
Like, the master curator of this branch.

01:50:28.919 --> 01:50:30.627
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but one day, maybe.

01:50:30.627 --> 01:50:31.911
MARISHA: I mean, maybe. I don't know.

01:50:31.911 --> 01:50:33.441
I kind of like the expositor life,

01:50:33.441 --> 01:50:35.941
because we're like the foot soldiers

01:50:35.941 --> 01:50:38.033
who go out and find shit.

01:50:38.033 --> 01:50:39.918
TALIESIN: I've heard you talk about "the Man" before.

01:50:39.918 --> 01:50:40.941
Are you now the Man?

01:50:40.941 --> 01:50:42.161
Is that the--?

01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:44.488
MARISHA: I've always been the man, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:50:44.488 --> 01:50:46.569
You're usually just kind of angry at the Man.

01:50:46.569 --> 01:50:47.416
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: That's true.

01:50:47.416 --> 01:50:49.442
TRAVIS: There's a lot of anger at the Man.

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:52.131
TALIESIN: Should probably examine that at some point.

01:50:52.131 --> 01:50:53.581
LIAM: I don't know.

01:50:53.581 --> 01:50:56.651
I think your intelligence is wasted on being a foot soldier.

01:50:56.651 --> 01:50:58.439
One day, maybe.
TALIESIN: Cheers.

01:50:58.439 --> 01:51:01.701
LAURA: Yeah, but you're so adventurous.

01:51:01.701 --> 01:51:02.534
MARISHA: Exactly.

01:51:02.534 --> 01:51:04.581
LAURA: It would suck to be stuck behind books all day.

01:51:04.581 --> 01:51:05.591
MARISHA: I mean--

01:51:05.591 --> 01:51:07.471
LAURA: I mean, not that there's
anything wrong with books, Caleb.

01:51:07.471 --> 01:51:09.731
Books are great.

01:51:09.731 --> 01:51:12.241
LIAM: You're on thin ice, Lavorre.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:51:12.241 --> 01:51:14.141
TRAVIS: You've got a lot of props in that room.

01:51:14.141 --> 01:51:16.971
Anything you need, best researchers on it?

01:51:16.971 --> 01:51:20.417
I mean, that's pretty high up the food chain.

01:51:22.031 --> 01:51:24.161
MARISHA: Dairon's been saying good shit.

01:51:24.161 --> 01:51:25.969
Thank god for Dairon.

01:51:27.135 --> 01:51:28.761
Cool.

01:51:28.761 --> 01:51:31.761
Well, that's done. Now what?

01:51:31.761 --> 01:51:33.901
TALIESIN: Couple of us still stick out like sore thumbs.

01:51:33.901 --> 01:51:34.794
That's a problem.

01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:37.925
LIAM: I can fix that.

01:51:37.925 --> 01:51:40.456
ASHLEY: Wait, what was their name again? The High Curator?

01:51:40.456 --> 01:51:42.021
MATT: The High Curator Yudala Fon.

01:51:42.021 --> 01:51:43.191
ASHLEY: Fon, yeah.

01:51:43.191 --> 01:51:46.261
TRAVIS: Would a expositor ever have an assistant,

01:51:46.261 --> 01:51:49.391
or a lackey, someone that would follow them around

01:51:49.391 --> 01:51:50.949
and help them?

01:51:50.949 --> 01:51:52.851
MARISHA: Maybe if I requested it.

01:51:52.851 --> 01:51:54.551
Like, put in an order for--
TRAVIS: I mean, like,

01:51:54.551 --> 01:51:56.041
I could make myself look like that

01:51:56.041 --> 01:51:57.501
and be, I don't know.
MARISHA: Oh.

01:51:57.501 --> 01:51:59.598
Maybe like an archivist, probably.

01:51:59.598 --> 01:52:01.271
TRAVIS: Your first mate, for a change.

01:52:01.271 --> 01:52:04.505
MARISHA: Like an archivist would maybe be someone like that?

01:52:04.505 --> 01:52:07.341
MATT: Expositors generally work alone

01:52:07.341 --> 01:52:08.881
because that's the most effective means

01:52:08.881 --> 01:52:10.531
of them doing their work,

01:52:10.531 --> 01:52:14.001
unless they're paired off in times of extreme crisis.

01:52:14.001 --> 01:52:15.351
MARISHA: So like a second expositor?

01:52:15.351 --> 01:52:17.391
MATT: A second expositor, maybe.

01:52:17.391 --> 01:52:19.151
No, normally the work--

01:52:19.151 --> 01:52:21.031
Like, you would work with archivists

01:52:21.031 --> 01:52:23.431
when you're in the actual library,

01:52:23.431 --> 01:52:26.751
but otherwise, your purpose is

01:52:26.751 --> 01:52:28.203
to go out and acquire and bring back.

01:52:28.203 --> 01:52:29.391
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:52:30.841 --> 01:52:32.561
So you can wear--

01:52:32.561 --> 01:52:35.581
It's like this gray and blue situation,

01:52:35.581 --> 01:52:37.386
with a gray belt.

01:52:37.386 --> 01:52:40.501
It's got a little symbol of Ioun clasp.

01:52:40.501 --> 01:52:42.831
Very, very tailored, yeah.
TRAVIS: Great.

01:52:42.831 --> 01:52:45.773
LIAM: Would you do me a favor? Would
you all gather up for a moment?

01:52:47.183 --> 01:52:48.016
Good.

01:52:48.016 --> 01:52:49.168
LAURA: You going to take our picture?

01:52:49.168 --> 01:52:52.381
LIAM: I cast Seeming, and everyone in the group,

01:52:52.381 --> 01:52:54.121
except for Beauregard, who is covered--

01:52:54.121 --> 01:52:56.931
SAM: Dies.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:52:56.931 --> 01:52:59.859
Disintegrate.
(laughter)

01:52:59.859 --> 01:53:01.092
MARISHA: Campaign over.
TRAVIS: <i>Fin</i>.

01:53:01.092 --> 01:53:04.311
(laughter)

01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:06.461
LIAM: Everyone is now dressed in--

01:53:06.461 --> 01:53:09.131
It's like when you go back from Los Angeles to New York,

01:53:09.131 --> 01:53:11.681
and everyone is in a black suit.

01:53:11.681 --> 01:53:16.241
Everyone is in brown, dark brown, very austere,

01:53:16.241 --> 01:53:19.321
serious-minded robes and coats

01:53:19.321 --> 01:53:21.921
that match the climate and temperature of Rexxentrum,

01:53:21.921 --> 01:53:24.731
which is pretty far north, so it's chillier here.

01:53:24.731 --> 01:53:27.721
So everyone's looking dressed very expensively,

01:53:27.721 --> 01:53:30.720
but again, very severe.

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:31.786
TALIESIN: This is temporary.
LAURA: <i>Caleb!</i>

01:53:31.786 --> 01:53:34.451
TALIESIN: We're going to have to
fix this into something reasonable.

01:53:35.541 --> 01:53:39.351
It's very conflicting.
SAM: Oh, poor Jester!

01:53:39.351 --> 01:53:40.271
TALIESIN: Yeah. No, this is--

01:53:40.271 --> 01:53:42.289
SAM: She's in a nun's outfit.
TALIESIN: We'll fix this.

01:53:42.289 --> 01:53:45.279
LAURA: Yeah. We've got to get the real clothes real soon.

01:53:45.279 --> 01:53:47.271
LIAM: That's pretty funny, though.

01:53:47.271 --> 01:53:49.012
MATT: Can't put down my arms!

01:53:49.012 --> 01:53:51.197
(laughter)

01:53:51.197 --> 01:53:52.591
MATT: All right.

01:53:52.591 --> 01:53:56.861
And with that, you step out into the Court of Colors,

01:53:56.861 --> 01:53:59.231
this beautiful plaza that is the mixture

01:53:59.231 --> 01:54:02.211
on the western edge of the Tangles section of Rexxentrum.

01:54:02.211 --> 01:54:04.641
It is where numerous roads and streets

01:54:04.641 --> 01:54:05.961
converge at odd angles

01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:10.151
and create this mishmash of individuals

01:54:10.151 --> 01:54:14.014
from all over the countryside of the Empire and beyond.

01:54:15.911 --> 01:54:19.141
You can see the southern walls of the Shimmer Ward.

01:54:19.141 --> 01:54:20.314
The Shimmer Ward, not far from here,

01:54:20.314 --> 01:54:21.341
where the Chantry of the Dawn was,

01:54:21.341 --> 01:54:23.571
where you had your last great battle here

01:54:23.571 --> 01:54:25.921
and freed Yasha from the tethers that held her.

01:54:28.245 --> 01:54:29.661
And where would you like to go?

01:54:29.661 --> 01:54:30.844
MARISHA: Rip the Band-Aid.

01:54:32.452 --> 01:54:34.127
LAURA: Where do you want to go?

01:54:34.127 --> 01:54:35.491
Should we go straight to her house?

01:54:35.491 --> 01:54:37.021
LIAM: We definitely have business here,

01:54:37.021 --> 01:54:41.308
but also, we are in Rexxentrum.

01:54:41.308 --> 01:54:42.141
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:54:43.058 --> 01:54:45.461
We didn't get to spend a lot of time here last time.

01:54:45.461 --> 01:54:47.344
LIAM: No, it was a little dangerous,

01:54:48.761 --> 01:54:50.002
at the very least.

01:54:51.577 --> 01:54:53.209
LAURA: What do you want to do?

01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:55.961
LIAM: Oh, I would like to...

01:54:58.411 --> 01:55:00.241
maybe walk by the school.

01:55:03.221 --> 01:55:05.731
And do a little more shopping here.

01:55:05.731 --> 01:55:06.772
LAURA: Do you need some more paper?

01:55:06.772 --> 01:55:08.678
TRAVIS: At least 400 gold more worth.
LIAM: No.

01:55:08.678 --> 01:55:10.261
LAURA: (laughs)
LIAM: I am good for now.

01:55:10.261 --> 01:55:12.007
I can get paper now.

01:55:15.690 --> 01:55:17.482
(sighing)

01:55:17.482 --> 01:55:19.981
This is my chance to maybe pick up a spell or two

01:55:19.981 --> 01:55:24.781
here in town, and I'm tempted to see the sights,

01:55:24.781 --> 01:55:27.241
but maybe we should keep it--

01:55:27.241 --> 01:55:28.701
TRAVIS: Do you think walking by the school

01:55:28.701 --> 01:55:31.511
will entice any sort of suspicion,

01:55:31.511 --> 01:55:34.674
or perhaps we're being watched already?

01:55:35.911 --> 01:55:38.341
LIAM: I don't know that it matters, Fjord,

01:55:38.341 --> 01:55:42.531
after our peace deal at sea.

01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:44.274
TRAVIS: True.

01:55:45.602 --> 01:55:49.077
LIAM: I don't know. I feel like we
may be swimming with sharks a little bit,

01:55:49.077 --> 01:55:51.621
and it's good to just get our feet wet,

01:55:51.621 --> 01:55:53.464
and get used to that.

01:55:54.661 --> 01:55:55.801
MARISHA: Yeah, I wouldn't mind getting

01:55:55.801 --> 01:55:57.691
a little bit lay of the land.

01:55:57.691 --> 01:55:59.411
Maybe making some other friends here

01:55:59.411 --> 01:56:02.291
before we go right into the belly of the beast.

01:56:02.291 --> 01:56:03.421
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:56:03.421 --> 01:56:07.071
MARISHA: I wouldn't mind going back by the temple, either,

01:56:07.071 --> 01:56:10.888
where we fought Obann.

01:56:10.888 --> 01:56:12.981
LIAM: Just to get another look at it?

01:56:12.981 --> 01:56:15.081
MARISHA: I don't know. See if anything's changed.

01:56:17.246 --> 01:56:19.031
LAURA: Okay.

01:56:19.031 --> 01:56:20.291
MARISHA: If that's okay with you, though.

01:56:20.291 --> 01:56:21.441
I don't know if--

01:56:22.521 --> 01:56:23.421
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:56:23.421 --> 01:56:24.861
I think that would be a good idea.

01:56:24.861 --> 01:56:29.861
I'd like to see it with my own eyes.

01:56:30.531 --> 01:56:32.166
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:56:33.408 --> 01:56:35.764
MATT: All right. Where are you off to first?

01:56:38.757 --> 01:56:40.257
LIAM: Let's start with the school.

01:56:41.227 --> 01:56:44.703
MATT: Okay. The-- you're referring of the Academy Grounds?

01:56:44.703 --> 01:56:45.644
LIAM: Yeah.

01:56:45.644 --> 01:56:48.110
MATT: Okay. That is within the Shimmer Ward,

01:56:49.337 --> 01:56:52.237
which is the inner portion of the city.

01:56:52.237 --> 01:56:55.197
If you're looking to shop for anything of your regards,

01:56:55.197 --> 01:56:57.506
it'd be along the way.
LIAM: Along the way, yeah.

01:56:57.506 --> 01:56:59.377
MATT: So before you'd even get to the Academy Grounds,

01:56:59.377 --> 01:57:03.577
you'd pass through, from what you'd know,

01:57:03.577 --> 01:57:05.857
probably the Vigil Circle, which is a part of the Tangles,

01:57:05.857 --> 01:57:07.287
which is what you're already in,

01:57:07.287 --> 01:57:08.477
heading towards the Shimmer Ward would be

01:57:08.477 --> 01:57:11.287
your best bet to find a place that might be able to--

01:57:11.287 --> 01:57:14.728
LIAM: Would I know a shop that would have both

01:57:16.345 --> 01:57:18.685
magical scrolls, as well as items?

01:57:18.685 --> 01:57:19.518
MATT: You would.

01:57:19.518 --> 01:57:23.977
There aren't many shops that sell magical scrolls

01:57:23.977 --> 01:57:26.887
because everything is very heavily controlled

01:57:26.887 --> 01:57:28.862
by the Assembly, specifically.

01:57:28.862 --> 01:57:31.017
LIAM: Pumat's place is a little
looser because it's further south.

01:57:31.017 --> 01:57:32.627
MATT: Because it's further south, but here in Rexxentrum,

01:57:32.627 --> 01:57:34.837
the proximity is so close that most business

01:57:34.837 --> 01:57:36.177
has to go through the Academy.

01:57:36.177 --> 01:57:37.010
LIAM: Okay.

01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:38.877
MATT: But there is one place you know of that

01:57:39.727 --> 01:57:43.070
gets away with it because it's a little looser.

01:57:44.547 --> 01:57:46.047
You haven't visited there, but you passed by

01:57:46.047 --> 01:57:46.880
a number of times, known as

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:49.617
Thaydeen's Endless Emporium of Enchanted Eccentricities.

01:57:49.617 --> 01:57:51.567
LAURA: Oh my god, I love this name.

01:57:51.567 --> 01:57:54.267
TRAVIS: What the fuck?
LIAM: Say that name one more time.

01:57:54.267 --> 01:57:58.060
MATT: Thaydeen's Endless Emporium
of Enchanted Eccentricities.

01:57:58.060 --> 01:57:58.943
ASHLEY: Thaydeen?

01:57:58.943 --> 01:58:01.050
LAURA: Is she related to--
LAURA and MARISHA: Gilmore?

01:58:02.143 --> 01:58:02.976
MATT: No.

01:58:02.976 --> 01:58:05.007
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:58:05.007 --> 01:58:08.218
Thaydeen's Endless--
LAURA and MARISHA: -- Emporium--

01:58:08.218 --> 01:58:10.678
LAURA: Of Enchanted--

01:58:10.678 --> 01:58:11.980
MATT: Eccentricities.

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:13.034
LAURA: Eccentricities.

01:58:13.034 --> 01:58:15.137
ASHLEY: Thaydeen's Endless Emporium--

01:58:15.137 --> 01:58:16.547
LIAM: There's not much in Rexxentrum;

01:58:16.547 --> 01:58:19.157
there's just the most amazingly-named store.

01:58:19.157 --> 01:58:19.990
MATT: Yeah.

01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:21.027
LIAM: In all of Exandria.

01:58:21.027 --> 01:58:22.400
MATT: You've not been into it.

01:58:23.997 --> 01:58:25.423
Or maybe you have, it's up to you.

01:58:25.423 --> 01:58:27.087
You'd be interested.

01:58:27.087 --> 01:58:28.807
LIAM: I would've. We would've gone and looked,

01:58:28.807 --> 01:58:31.077
knowing that we couldn't afford anything.

01:58:31.077 --> 01:58:31.984
MATT: True enough.

01:58:36.027 --> 01:58:37.497
It's on the southern side of the Tangles,

01:58:37.497 --> 01:58:39.927
in the area called the Vigil Circle,

01:58:39.927 --> 01:58:42.227
which is a circular marketplace that is built

01:58:42.227 --> 01:58:43.687
around a loop of road that surrounds

01:58:43.687 --> 01:58:46.482
the temple of Erathis called the Tower of Writ.

01:58:47.867 --> 01:58:49.587
So where the Prime Arbiter delivers judgment

01:58:49.587 --> 01:58:51.187
universally throughout the city.

01:58:52.337 --> 01:58:54.217
All manner of strange commerce takes place here

01:58:54.217 --> 01:58:55.567
and there are all sorts of weird buildings,

01:58:55.567 --> 01:58:57.197
as well as the Claykeep prison,

01:58:57.197 --> 01:58:59.287
which sits ominously in the center of it

01:58:59.287 --> 01:59:01.397
by the temple so that anyone who's doing business

01:59:01.397 --> 01:59:04.787
knows to not pilfer anything, because it's real quick

01:59:04.787 --> 01:59:07.197
to get over to where they'll be forever kept.

01:59:07.197 --> 01:59:08.607
LAURA: The Quakey prison?

01:59:08.607 --> 01:59:10.228
SAM and MATT: Claykeep.

01:59:10.228 --> 01:59:12.126
MATT: (Elmer Fudd voice) You ever been to the Quakey prison?

01:59:12.126 --> 01:59:13.189
LAURA: I know.

01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:14.575
(laughter)

01:59:14.575 --> 01:59:16.157
LAURA: The Claykeep.

01:59:16.157 --> 01:59:17.777
That sounds scarier.

01:59:17.777 --> 01:59:22.557
MATT: Indeed, but as you approach, familiar to you, Caleb,

01:59:22.557 --> 01:59:25.197
but you guys see a cylindrical structure

01:59:25.197 --> 01:59:28.237
that looks like a smaller amphitheater.

01:59:28.237 --> 01:59:31.657
It is a two-story set,

01:59:31.657 --> 01:59:36.157
large cylindrical building that is surrounded by a large,

01:59:36.157 --> 01:59:40.770
equally tall, dark red velvet maroon set of curtains.

01:59:42.007 --> 01:59:43.067
There are no windows.

01:59:43.067 --> 01:59:44.977
It just looks almost like a velvet cake.

01:59:44.977 --> 01:59:48.197
It's this weird, large curtain

01:59:48.197 --> 01:59:51.551
with some gold rope trim that comes down

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:52.977
and it just splits right to the front,

01:59:52.977 --> 01:59:54.847
where there is a door archway,

01:59:54.847 --> 01:59:57.637
and you see a sign above it, this arched sign

01:59:57.637 --> 01:59:59.837
that is beautifully painted, and it says

01:59:59.837 --> 02:00:01.367
the entire layered name across it

02:00:01.367 --> 02:00:05.807
of Thaydeen's Endless Emporium of Enchanted Eccentricities.

02:00:05.807 --> 02:00:06.848
TRAVIS: God yes.

02:00:07.919 --> 02:00:09.319
Oh my god.

02:00:09.319 --> 02:00:10.967
MARISHA: We needed a good shopkeeper.

02:00:10.967 --> 02:00:13.071
TRAVIS: Why did I buy this fucking ring?

02:00:13.071 --> 02:00:14.732
(laughter)

02:00:14.732 --> 02:00:16.210
TRAVIS: About to walk into Costco.

02:00:17.499 --> 02:00:20.187
MARISHA: You're the kid who spends
all their field trip money

02:00:20.187 --> 02:00:21.478
at the first stop.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:00:21.478 --> 02:00:24.550
TRAVIS: Like a thousand Lemonheads.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:26.437
SAM: I did that.
ASHLEY: Damn it!

02:00:26.437 --> 02:00:29.590
MATT: As you all enter the interior of this location,

02:00:31.177 --> 02:00:34.637
you can see this is like

02:00:34.637 --> 02:00:38.929
a gaudy warehouse filled with shelves and shelves--

02:00:38.929 --> 02:00:40.053
LAURA: It's magic Costco.

02:00:40.053 --> 02:00:43.447
MATT: -- of knickknacks and small collectibles

02:00:43.447 --> 02:00:46.487
and odd little trinkets and baubles here and there.

02:00:46.487 --> 02:00:48.747
A lot of the shelves are-- there's gaps.

02:00:48.747 --> 02:00:50.967
There's missing, there's a lack of signs

02:00:50.967 --> 02:00:54.367
and it looks like a lot of it has been cleared out,

02:00:54.367 --> 02:00:56.917
though there are a number of things here and there.

02:00:58.067 --> 02:01:00.242
TALIESIN: Fjord, you should get this, right here.

02:01:00.242 --> 02:01:01.427
(laughter)

02:01:01.427 --> 02:01:04.507
LAURA: I pat Fjord on the shoulder and just say:

02:01:04.507 --> 02:01:07.363
Fjord, your ring is really pretty.

02:01:08.417 --> 02:01:09.792
TRAVIS: It's very climate controlled

02:01:09.792 --> 02:01:11.392
in here now because of it.

02:01:11.392 --> 02:01:14.077
ASHLEY: Fjord, there's also this lovely coin over here.

02:01:14.077 --> 02:01:15.170
Don't know if...

02:01:15.170 --> 02:01:16.221
(laughter)

02:01:16.221 --> 02:01:17.462
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

02:01:17.462 --> 02:01:19.784
No, that's personal.

02:01:19.784 --> 02:01:20.634
(laughter)

02:01:20.634 --> 02:01:23.031
TRAVIS: Don't you bring Ren Faire into this.

02:01:23.031 --> 02:01:27.632
(laughter)

02:01:27.632 --> 02:01:29.817
TALIESIN: Took me a minute to get there, but I got there.

02:01:29.817 --> 02:01:31.724
MATT: Well done.
TRAVIS: I haven't been drinking nearly enough.

02:01:31.724 --> 02:01:35.955
(laughter)

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:36.788
LIAM: Amazing.

02:01:38.727 --> 02:01:40.590
Dragged, dragged.

02:01:43.227 --> 02:01:45.167
MATT: As you walk through the center area,

02:01:45.167 --> 02:01:47.087
and there are layers of shelves

02:01:47.087 --> 02:01:49.587
that lead towards a center

02:01:49.587 --> 02:01:53.437
circular counter with a back exit portion,

02:01:53.437 --> 02:01:55.507
and as you all begin to step in and talk

02:01:55.507 --> 02:01:59.347
and look around you, the still silence in the chamber

02:01:59.347 --> 02:02:02.077
is broken by what sounds like (record player starting)

02:02:02.077 --> 02:02:06.696
and music starts playing, triggered by your arrival.

02:02:06.696 --> 02:02:08.174
ASHLEY: So cool!

02:02:08.174 --> 02:02:11.937
MATT: You hear (quick footsteps)
charging from the back chamber.

02:02:11.937 --> 02:02:16.167
You see a very tall, probably about as tall as Caduceus,

02:02:16.167 --> 02:02:21.017
though broad-shouldered, feminine form

02:02:21.017 --> 02:02:25.567
with this strangely tangled red hair

02:02:25.567 --> 02:02:28.097
that goes down past the shoulders,

02:02:28.097 --> 02:02:31.247
into this Brave-like poof.

02:02:31.247 --> 02:02:35.110
The skin is dark, dull gray with black shapes

02:02:35.110 --> 02:02:36.267
and tattoos across it.

02:02:36.267 --> 02:02:37.430
This is a goliath.

02:02:39.137 --> 02:02:42.177
Pupilless woman charging up, like (thudding),

02:02:42.177 --> 02:02:44.027
full sprint in these long, flowing,

02:02:44.027 --> 02:02:45.767
also red robes that match the curtains

02:02:45.767 --> 02:02:47.437
from the exterior of the chamber,

02:02:47.437 --> 02:02:49.007
coming to the middle of this central counter

02:02:49.007 --> 02:02:53.373
and then placing hands on the edge and goes,

02:02:53.373 --> 02:02:54.557
(New Zealand accent) "'Ello."

02:02:54.557 --> 02:02:55.672
(laughter)

02:02:55.672 --> 02:02:58.156
"And welcome."

02:02:58.156 --> 02:02:59.147
And that's where we're going to take a break.

02:02:59.147 --> 02:03:01.656
(groaning)

02:03:03.648 --> 02:03:07.157
SAM: A Kiwi goliath?
MARISHA: I'm so excited!

02:03:07.157 --> 02:03:08.687
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking awesome.

02:03:08.687 --> 02:03:10.677
MATT: So take a short break here.

02:03:12.477 --> 02:03:13.657
We'll be back here in just a few minutes,

02:03:13.657 --> 02:03:15.785
so see you guys here right quick.

02:03:16.804 --> 02:03:19.524
Now experience the ultimate way to play

02:03:19.524 --> 02:03:22.514
by sitting at a table with your friends,

02:03:22.514 --> 02:03:24.494
with your face in a screen.

02:03:24.494 --> 02:03:25.804
Progress!

02:03:25.804 --> 02:03:27.784
D and D Beyond.

02:03:27.784 --> 02:03:31.734
Log in to explore strange worlds and fantastical cities,

02:03:31.734 --> 02:03:34.844
thanks to a company based in a really boring one

02:03:34.844 --> 02:03:37.404
that handles all the tedious math and reference stuff

02:03:37.404 --> 02:03:40.404
for you, so you can finally unleash the epic quest

02:03:40.404 --> 02:03:43.294
you've been crafting since middle school on your friends,

02:03:43.294 --> 02:03:45.624
or just do what most people use it for,

02:03:45.624 --> 02:03:47.174
breaking out endless new characters

02:03:47.174 --> 02:03:48.504
while they're bored at work.

02:03:48.504 --> 02:03:50.194
I could finish these spreadsheets,

02:03:50.194 --> 02:03:52.930
but what if this Paladin owned a horse?

02:03:52.930 --> 02:03:55.454
(heavenly music)

02:03:55.454 --> 02:03:56.644
Perfect.

02:03:56.644 --> 02:04:00.087 line:20%
D and D Beyond, play with advantage.

02:04:02.682 --> 02:04:05.432
(ethereal music)

02:04:06.764 --> 02:04:07.597
Hello?

02:04:08.934 --> 02:04:09.947
Hello.

02:04:13.838 --> 02:04:15.834
What is this place, where am I?

02:04:18.644 --> 02:04:20.437
What happened to the rest of my body?

02:04:23.484 --> 02:04:24.317
Oh no.

02:04:26.384 --> 02:04:27.527
Did I die?

02:04:30.338 --> 02:04:31.171
Wait a minute.

02:04:32.774 --> 02:04:34.027
Are we on the internet?

02:04:35.590 --> 02:04:36.484
[Dani] Soon!

02:04:36.484 --> 02:04:37.317
Oh shit!

02:04:39.653 --> 02:04:42.486
(soft folk music)

02:05:07.694 --> 02:05:09.804
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:05:09.804 --> 02:05:12.781
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:05:12.781 --> 02:05:13.734
(upbeat music)

02:05:13.734 --> 02:05:15.454
Ooh, look at this.

02:05:15.454 --> 02:05:17.587
Look at the details, ooh!

02:05:20.124 --> 02:05:22.224
You're only five clicks away from owning this,

02:05:22.224 --> 02:05:24.774
maybe more if you have a lot of windows open

02:05:24.774 --> 02:05:26.937
on your browser, I don't know your life.

02:05:28.654 --> 02:05:30.747
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:05:33.344 --> 02:05:35.584
Darling, I'd recommend buying two.

02:05:35.584 --> 02:05:38.884
One for you and another for you.

02:05:38.884 --> 02:05:39.717
Let's be honest.

02:05:40.956 --> 02:05:43.144
(liquid pouring)

02:05:43.144 --> 02:05:44.644
This is a lot of stuff you guys.

02:05:44.644 --> 02:05:47.361
We have like so many cool things right now.

02:05:49.708 --> 02:05:52.658
All this and more, now available in the Critical Role shop.

02:05:58.629 --> 02:06:01.957
(soft, dark music)

02:06:01.957 --> 02:06:03.864
Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

02:06:03.864 --> 02:06:07.274
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

02:06:07.274 --> 02:06:11.534
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

02:06:11.534 --> 02:06:15.074
on the other side of the fourth wall.

02:06:15.074 --> 02:06:17.494
And what is fourth wall,

02:06:17.494 --> 02:06:20.114
separating the viewer from the creator.

02:06:20.114 --> 02:06:22.954
A portal to an often sought point of connection

02:06:22.954 --> 02:06:26.197
or the Twitch subscription zone?

02:06:27.244 --> 02:06:29.924
On the rare occasion that you miss the live bacchanal

02:06:29.924 --> 02:06:33.784
boasted by the ragtag group of thespians on Thursday night,

02:06:33.784 --> 02:06:36.044
you may always view the show on demand

02:06:36.044 --> 02:06:40.754 line:20%
in the shadowland known as the Twitch subscription zone.

02:06:40.754 --> 02:06:41.944
Picture if you will,

02:06:41.944 --> 02:06:45.164
the necessary pieces to complete a jigsaw puzzle,

02:06:45.164 --> 02:06:48.604
but it's up to you to choose how it will be solved.

02:06:48.604 --> 02:06:52.074 line:20%
You could of course subscribe with your debt rectangle,

02:06:52.074 --> 02:06:55.214
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

02:06:55.214 --> 02:06:57.204
Perhaps you found yourself in possession

02:06:57.204 --> 02:06:59.637 line:20%
of an Amazon prime account.

02:07:00.684 --> 02:07:02.284
You would then wake up to discover

02:07:02.284 --> 02:07:04.474
a free Twitch subscription each month

02:07:04.474 --> 02:07:06.694
for a channel of your choosing.

02:07:06.694 --> 02:07:08.804
But this artifact demands renewal,

02:07:08.804 --> 02:07:10.924 line:20%
for you must resubscribe each month

02:07:10.924 --> 02:07:12.967 line:20%
to quench its unyielding thirst.

02:07:13.944 --> 02:07:15.934
One need not walk alone.

02:07:15.934 --> 02:07:17.744
Those who have already found their way

02:07:17.744 --> 02:07:20.034
can illuminate the path for others

02:07:20.034 --> 02:07:22.817 line:20%
via the gift a sub button on Twitch.

02:07:24.134 --> 02:07:26.954
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription

02:07:26.954 --> 02:07:29.214
and wishes to thank you from behind the thin veil

02:07:29.214 --> 02:07:31.944
of this fourth wall.

02:07:31.944 --> 02:07:35.564
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

02:07:35.564 --> 02:07:38.424
And so ends another meandering digression,

02:07:38.424 --> 02:07:42.104
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

02:07:42.104 --> 02:07:46.017
to the region we call the Twitch subscription zone.

02:07:55.281 --> 02:07:56.864
You will subscribe.

02:07:57.834 --> 02:08:02.077
Twitch prime subscribe, gift subscribe.

02:08:04.429 --> 02:08:06.307
Subscribe.

02:20:47.567 --> 02:20:48.720
MATT: And welcome back.

02:20:49.657 --> 02:20:52.707
So, as you all stand now in the center

02:20:52.707 --> 02:20:54.887
of the Endless Emporium of Enchanted Eccentricities,

02:20:54.887 --> 02:20:58.797
you see who you assume to be Thaydeen there,

02:20:58.797 --> 02:21:02.220
arms out on the edges of the central counter, going,

02:21:03.107 --> 02:21:07.447
"So, what are you looking for, if I might ask, huh?"

02:21:07.447 --> 02:21:08.810
LAURA: Oh my goodness.

02:21:09.837 --> 02:21:11.809
MATT: You've had a numerous experiences with the goliaths,

02:21:11.809 --> 02:21:13.247
and you know, depending on where they grew up

02:21:13.247 --> 02:21:14.422
and where they're from, you know,

02:21:14.422 --> 02:21:18.282
they can be anywhere from stoic to jovial.

02:21:18.282 --> 02:21:20.657
This is certainly one of the strangest goliaths

02:21:20.657 --> 02:21:22.337
you've encountered.

02:21:22.337 --> 02:21:26.097
Big smile, wild eyes, and just happy

02:21:26.097 --> 02:21:27.347
to have customers at the moment.

02:21:27.347 --> 02:21:28.937
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's just us in the emporium.

02:21:28.937 --> 02:21:29.770
MATT: It's just you.

02:21:29.770 --> 02:21:32.957
It is so big and so empty, it is off-putting.

02:21:32.957 --> 02:21:34.577
LIAM: Oh my-
MARISHA: Like Fry's.

02:21:34.577 --> 02:21:38.497
LIAM: Hard to know where to
let our eyes rest; there is so much.

02:21:38.497 --> 02:21:40.407
We have just come from very far away,

02:21:40.407 --> 02:21:43.034
from the edge of civilization itself, so it's--

02:21:43.034 --> 02:21:45.117
MATT: "That's very, very far away."

02:21:45.117 --> 02:21:46.346
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah.

02:21:46.346 --> 02:21:48.157
It's not a couple blocks, it's--

02:21:48.157 --> 02:21:50.127
LAURA: Have you ever heard of Rumblecusp?

02:21:51.453 --> 02:21:54.620
MATT: "No. Is it nice to visit?"

02:21:55.497 --> 02:21:57.867
LAURA: Yes, it is very nice now. If you're ever

02:21:57.867 --> 02:22:01.340
looking for somewhere to go, it's got a great resort.

02:22:03.334 --> 02:22:04.200
MATT: "Just a moment."

02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:06.537
She turns around and starts writing "Rumblecusp"

02:22:06.537 --> 02:22:07.370
in a notebook.

02:22:08.437 --> 02:22:11.044
"So anyway, can I help you?

02:22:12.537 --> 02:22:14.267
"I'm terribly sorry.

02:22:14.267 --> 02:22:15.677
"You're all new faces in here.

02:22:15.677 --> 02:22:20.297
"I am Dimble Thaydeen, and welcome to

02:22:20.297 --> 02:22:24.822
"Thaydeen's Endless Emporium of Enchanted Eccentricities.

02:22:25.807 --> 02:22:27.117
"Now, what are you looking for?"

02:22:27.117 --> 02:22:28.651
TRAVIS: Did you say Dimble?

02:22:28.651 --> 02:22:29.576
MATT: "Dimble."

02:22:29.576 --> 02:22:31.376
TRAVIS: Wonderful.
MATT: "I didn't choose it."

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:32.917
TRAVIS: Great name.
MARISHA: I love it.

02:22:32.917 --> 02:22:34.503
LIAM: Who did choose it?

02:22:34.503 --> 02:22:36.327
MATT: "My parents."
LIAM: Oh, I see.

02:22:36.327 --> 02:22:40.270
LAURA: Should we call you Miss Thaydeen or Dimble?

02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:42.700
MATT: "Preferably Thaydeen, it's what I'm used to."

02:22:43.907 --> 02:22:45.657
TRAVIS: What is your shop known for?

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:48.145
I mean, what is it that people come to

02:22:48.145 --> 02:22:50.947
the Endless Emporium for most regularly?

02:22:50.947 --> 02:22:53.007
LIAM: I assume the eccentric.

02:22:53.007 --> 02:22:56.657
MATT: "Well, let's just say there's nary a proper party

02:22:56.657 --> 02:22:58.297
"here in Rexxentrum that doesn't have

02:22:58.297 --> 02:23:00.487
"my stamp on it somewhere.

02:23:00.487 --> 02:23:05.457
"So, all sorts of decorations, collectibles, take a look,

02:23:05.457 --> 02:23:07.747
"take a gander. All of these are either

02:23:07.747 --> 02:23:10.237
"made by me or imported directly to me

02:23:10.237 --> 02:23:13.597
"by other craftsmen from all over Wildemount and beyond."

02:23:13.597 --> 02:23:15.677
And you look around and you look at some of the shelves

02:23:15.677 --> 02:23:18.517
as you go by and there's like, little sculptures

02:23:18.517 --> 02:23:21.367
and there's-- It's a weird combination

02:23:21.367 --> 02:23:26.367
of novelty store and antique Salvation Army,

02:23:26.370 --> 02:23:28.503
of novelty store and antique Salvation Army,

02:23:29.525 --> 02:23:31.988
with a little bit of odd, colorful flair.

02:23:33.557 --> 02:23:34.390
"So."

02:23:34.390 --> 02:23:37.087
LAURA: Do you have anything that will help

02:23:38.247 --> 02:23:41.507
protect people's brains from being overtaken

02:23:42.447 --> 02:23:46.243
by, like, other people. Like, mind control?

02:23:47.147 --> 02:23:50.602
MATT: "That's a very specific request.

02:23:52.457 --> 02:23:55.447
"Funny thing is, with the recent conflict,

02:23:55.447 --> 02:23:58.538
"a lot of the things of

02:23:58.538 --> 02:24:01.363
"that sort of similar specification

02:24:01.363 --> 02:24:04.663
"were commandeered by the Assembly.

02:24:05.527 --> 02:24:07.377
"They'll all be coming back in in a few weeks,

02:24:07.377 --> 02:24:09.527
"those that weren't used now that we're at peace

02:24:09.527 --> 02:24:13.947
"and the war's over, but for the time being,

02:24:13.947 --> 02:24:18.360
"I've only got, hold on."

02:24:19.509 --> 02:24:21.367
And she goes and checks through her ledger,

02:24:21.367 --> 02:24:22.844
closes that, looks at you.

02:24:24.027 --> 02:24:25.580
"A whole lot of collectibles.

02:24:27.817 --> 02:24:28.867
"If you're looking for things that are

02:24:28.867 --> 02:24:30.537
"specifically enchanted, I've got

02:24:30.537 --> 02:24:32.997
"a few specialties of mine here.

02:24:32.997 --> 02:24:35.667
"I've got some celebones, some oops-stones,

02:24:35.667 --> 02:24:38.085
"some chuckle dust.

02:24:38.085 --> 02:24:40.740
"And this here ring."

02:24:42.437 --> 02:24:43.657
LAURA: Another ring, huh?

02:24:43.657 --> 02:24:46.252
SAM: It's a ring of fire protection for 500 gold.

02:24:46.252 --> 02:24:49.692
(laughter)

02:24:49.692 --> 02:24:50.800
ASHLEY: That would be amazing.

02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:54.811
TRAVIS: Don't do that. Don't.

02:24:57.667 --> 02:24:59.367
LAURA: What is it?
LIAM: What does this do, pray tell?

02:25:00.386 --> 02:25:01.499
MATT: "Which one? The chuckle dust?"

02:25:01.499 --> 02:25:03.577
LIAM: The ring, we'll start with the ring.

02:25:03.577 --> 02:25:05.827
Hoping for fire protection.
MARISHA: That's what I want to know.

02:25:06.677 --> 02:25:08.651
MATT: You see a garnet-- no, no you don't.

02:25:08.651 --> 02:25:10.652
(laughter)

02:25:10.652 --> 02:25:11.827
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:25:11.827 --> 02:25:13.937
MATT: "This was one that I managed to keep hidden

02:25:13.937 --> 02:25:17.381
"from being commandeered, so please keep it on the down low.

02:25:17.381 --> 02:25:20.097
"Because," and she points over on the edge

02:25:20.097 --> 02:25:22.467
of one of nearby walls, you can see the similar symbol

02:25:22.467 --> 02:25:25.257
of the four central-- oh, that's right--
the three central diamonds

02:25:25.257 --> 02:25:29.297
pointing, the Assembly symbology that you're familiar with.

02:25:30.485 --> 02:25:33.277
"So, this here is generally utilized

02:25:33.277 --> 02:25:35.357
"for more of a utility purpose.

02:25:35.357 --> 02:25:38.491
"Those who are gathering their various arcane

02:25:38.491 --> 02:25:43.477
"spellcraft type of endeavors, under certain specifications,

02:25:43.477 --> 02:25:45.717
"they can take a single target spell

02:25:45.717 --> 02:25:48.867
"and make it a dual target spell.

02:25:48.867 --> 02:25:52.367
"I call it the Ring of Spell-Splitting."

02:25:52.367 --> 02:25:53.200
LAURA: Ooh!

02:25:54.237 --> 02:25:56.787
MATT: And she reveals it with this flair and flourish.

02:25:56.787 --> 02:26:00.054
You look inside this simple box and you see

02:26:00.054 --> 02:26:01.467
a gold and silver band

02:26:01.467 --> 02:26:03.757
that are just spiraling around each other,

02:26:03.757 --> 02:26:07.307
in a singular loop. Simple in some ways,

02:26:07.307 --> 02:26:10.070
but still very beautiful in its simplicity.

02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:12.907
LAURA: Is there like a max, you know,

02:26:12.907 --> 02:26:15.827
strength of spell that it will work on?

02:26:15.827 --> 02:26:18.510
MATT: "This will only get to a certain point, right.

02:26:19.564 --> 02:26:20.737
"And it has to be a certain kind of spell.

02:26:20.737 --> 02:26:23.777
"But it allows you, once a day,

02:26:23.777 --> 02:26:26.260
"to make it hit two instead of one."

02:26:27.247 --> 02:26:30.757
LIAM: And this is more for the sort of

02:26:30.757 --> 02:26:33.387
painful type of spell, perhaps?

02:26:33.387 --> 02:26:36.347
MATT: "It depends, if it's a specific target,

02:26:36.347 --> 02:26:37.804
"perhaps it can be two.

02:26:39.127 --> 02:26:42.657
"But if it has like more of a area,

02:26:42.657 --> 02:26:44.569
"not so much; it to be a specific target."

02:26:44.569 --> 02:26:45.451
LIAM: Understood.

02:26:45.451 --> 02:26:48.362
LAURA: What if it's a touch spell?

02:26:48.362 --> 02:26:49.671
MATT: "Does it have a specific target?"

02:26:49.671 --> 02:26:51.504
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "Can you touch two of them?"

02:26:51.504 --> 02:26:52.438
MARISHA: (imitating Laura) Yeah.

02:26:52.438 --> 02:26:53.271
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:26:53.271 --> 02:26:54.617
MATT: Maybe?

02:26:54.617 --> 02:26:56.747
TRAVIS: What's up, man? It's happening.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:26:56.747 --> 02:26:58.187
TALIESIN: What if it's, like, a healing spell

02:26:58.187 --> 02:27:00.787
that you're just doing with one target,

02:27:00.787 --> 02:27:03.365
then it's two targets?

02:27:03.365 --> 02:27:05.067
MATT: "That could be possible."

02:27:05.067 --> 02:27:06.044
LAUAR: How much, how much, how much, how much,

02:27:06.044 --> 02:27:07.594
how much are you asking for it?

02:27:09.537 --> 02:27:11.587
MATT: "Well, aren't you just the eager beaver, huh?

02:27:14.077 --> 02:27:16.385
"I'll let this one go for

02:27:18.085 --> 02:27:19.226
"6000 gold pieces.

02:27:19.226 --> 02:27:21.715
TRAVIS: Woo! Woo, woo!

02:27:22.559 --> 02:27:25.827
LAURA: 6000 gold pieces, that's a lot of gold pieces.

02:27:25.827 --> 02:27:27.837
TRAVIS: Sorry, Willmott, woo.

02:27:27.837 --> 02:27:30.321
MATT: "Now, mind you,

02:27:30.321 --> 02:27:33.245
"I give discounts
for those who buy in bulk,

02:27:33.245 --> 02:27:37.622
"and there are many other things to pick up around here."

02:27:37.622 --> 02:27:39.311
LAURA: Woof.

02:27:39.311 --> 02:27:41.477
MARISHA: What are the oops-stones?

02:27:41.477 --> 02:27:42.343
MATT: "Ah."

02:27:42.343 --> 02:27:45.727
MARISHA: I said, stuffing my face with popcorn.

02:27:45.727 --> 02:27:48.007
MATT: Goes ahead and pulls a, looks like a small,

02:27:48.007 --> 02:27:50.414
polished river stone with a

02:27:50.414 --> 02:27:52.487
light, yellowish-green coloration.

02:27:52.487 --> 02:27:57.487
"This stone, when activated and thrown,

02:27:57.537 --> 02:28:02.427
"will emit a terrible odor within a specific radius,

02:28:02.427 --> 02:28:05.787
"making everyone around it unable to deal with it,

02:28:05.787 --> 02:28:08.127
"for the most part, have to vacate

02:28:08.127 --> 02:28:11.139
"or probably puke all over their shoes."

02:28:11.139 --> 02:28:13.317
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:28:13.317 --> 02:28:16.987
It's not what I thought you'd say with an oops-stone, but--

02:28:16.987 --> 02:28:18.692
MATT: "Smells like an oops."

02:28:18.692 --> 02:28:21.082
(laughter)

02:28:21.082 --> 02:28:22.729
LAURA: That's amazing.

02:28:22.729 --> 02:28:25.257
ASHLEY: "Smells like an oops."

02:28:25.257 --> 02:28:27.947
What's the chuckle dust?

02:28:27.947 --> 02:28:29.217
MATT: "Ah, chuckle dust."

02:28:29.217 --> 02:28:31.707
Pulls up this yellowish pouch.

02:28:31.707 --> 02:28:33.637
"Each one of these pouches," and it's about this big,

02:28:33.637 --> 02:28:35.137
"has about 10 uses of it.

02:28:35.137 --> 02:28:39.187
"You sprinkle enough to cover about a square foot

02:28:39.187 --> 02:28:42.857
"of a flat surface, flat-ish surface.

02:28:42.857 --> 02:28:45.877
"as the dust begins to crackle, it gives off

02:28:45.877 --> 02:28:49.777
"a unique cycling bit of laughter,

02:28:49.777 --> 02:28:53.650
"for a full, I think 10 minutes.

02:28:57.067 --> 02:28:58.347
"If you scatter it over a bunch,

02:28:58.347 --> 02:29:00.447
"it's a bunch of different laughs.

02:29:00.447 --> 02:29:01.572
"Great for a party."

02:29:02.777 --> 02:29:03.807
LAURA: Interesting.

02:29:03.807 --> 02:29:05.357
ASHLEY: Tell a joke, you know?

02:29:05.357 --> 02:29:06.287
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "Yeah, yeah."

02:29:06.287 --> 02:29:08.267
LIAM: Laugh track in a bag.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:29:08.267 --> 02:29:10.077
MATT: "Make small crowds seem like they're larger crowds,

02:29:10.077 --> 02:29:12.387
"if you're trying to draw a crowd, you know.

02:29:12.387 --> 02:29:13.800
"Real popular with comedians."

02:29:16.257 --> 02:29:18.007
LAURA: What was the other thing you had?

02:29:18.007 --> 02:29:19.957
MATT: "Ah, that's the celebone."

02:29:19.957 --> 02:29:22.413
LIAM: Celebone.
LAURA: What is the celebone?

02:29:22.413 --> 02:29:24.097
MATT: She goes and pulls out of this rod

02:29:24.097 --> 02:29:25.547
with a ring at the end of it.

02:29:26.597 --> 02:29:27.430
Kind of swings it a bit.

02:29:27.430 --> 02:29:29.417
It's it looks like it's semi-translucent,

02:29:29.417 --> 02:29:31.327
almost like a glass rod of some kind.

02:29:31.327 --> 02:29:34.727
He goes like, "This is reusable."

02:29:35.667 --> 02:29:37.460
Don't you dare, Laura.

02:29:37.460 --> 02:29:39.244
(laughter)

02:29:39.244 --> 02:29:40.699
SAM: It's an invisible dildo?

02:29:40.699 --> 02:29:41.857
MATT: No!

02:29:43.153 --> 02:29:44.736
TRAVIS: (like Matt) No!
ASHLEY: (like Matt) No!

02:29:44.736 --> 02:29:46.003
LIAM: (mockingly resentful) Stop!

02:29:46.927 --> 02:29:49.128
It's a very powerful magical item.

02:29:49.128 --> 02:29:52.170
(laughter)

02:29:53.077 --> 02:29:54.947
MATT: "Like I said, there isn't a party

02:29:54.947 --> 02:29:56.857
"around these parts that I haven't had some hand in,"

02:29:56.857 --> 02:29:58.996
and is just waving it.

02:29:58.996 --> 02:30:01.836
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Let chaos reign!

02:30:04.577 --> 02:30:06.307
MATT: "Watch this."

02:30:06.307 --> 02:30:11.300
(laughter)

02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:16.300
(laughter)

02:30:17.206 --> 02:30:20.031
LAURA: I didn't even say anything!

02:30:21.915 --> 02:30:23.819
MATT: You ever have a moment where you write something,

02:30:23.819 --> 02:30:25.197
and it's not until you're saying it out loud

02:30:25.197 --> 02:30:28.722
to a specific person that you're like, oh no.

02:30:28.722 --> 02:30:29.555
(laughter)

02:30:29.555 --> 02:30:31.367
Oh no.

02:30:31.367 --> 02:30:34.927
So she twists it, and it immediately begins to just

02:30:34.927 --> 02:30:39.277
give off bright colored lights, like a disco.

02:30:39.277 --> 02:30:41.047
LAURA: Whoa, like all different colors?
MATT: All different colors.

02:30:41.047 --> 02:30:42.467
It's just a kaleidoscope of light

02:30:42.467 --> 02:30:43.521
within a 20-foot radius.

02:30:43.521 --> 02:30:46.197
LAURA: Oh my god, this store is amazing!

02:30:46.197 --> 02:30:47.780
MATT: "This'll last for an hour.

02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:49.710
"It can be used once a day."

02:30:49.710 --> 02:30:51.496
LAURA: It's like a party light!

02:30:51.496 --> 02:30:54.527
MATT: "Got 10 of these." Waving that around, sticks it down.

02:30:54.527 --> 02:30:56.797
"Got 26 of the oops-stones.

02:30:56.797 --> 02:31:00.589
"And I've got 11 chuckle dust pouches at the ready."

02:31:00.589 --> 02:31:02.913
LAURA: How much are they each?

02:31:02.913 --> 02:31:05.287
MATT: "Celebones, 20 gold apiece.

02:31:05.287 --> 02:31:07.824
"Oops-stones, five gold apiece, but one use only.

02:31:07.824 --> 02:31:10.397
"And the chuckle dust is 10 gold a pouch."

02:31:11.326 --> 02:31:12.417
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:31:12.417 --> 02:31:14.527
TRAVIS: Could I take two of those oops-stones?

02:31:14.527 --> 02:31:18.194
LAURA: I would definitely like an oops-stone as well,

02:31:18.194 --> 02:31:21.177
and a celebone, and the chuckle dust.

02:31:21.177 --> 02:31:22.957
TRAVIS: Here's 10 gold.
MATT: "One of each?"

02:31:22.957 --> 02:31:23.977
LAURA: Yeah.

02:31:23.977 --> 02:31:26.236
TALIESIN: I'll take a celebone and a chuckle dust as well.

02:31:26.236 --> 02:31:27.757
MATT: "Celebones, 20 gold apiece,

02:31:27.757 --> 02:31:29.837
"so if you're going to buy one, pay up."

02:31:29.837 --> 02:31:32.717
MARISHA: I'll also take two oops-stones.

02:31:32.717 --> 02:31:34.917
MATT: "Oops-stones are five gold apiece. That's 10 for you."

02:31:34.917 --> 02:31:36.897
LAURA: Oh, then I want another oops-stone as well.

02:31:36.897 --> 02:31:39.312
So I'll go in for...

02:31:40.517 --> 02:31:42.887
I want five oops-stones.

02:31:42.887 --> 02:31:44.423
(laughter)

02:31:44.423 --> 02:31:45.595
MATT: "All right.

02:31:45.595 --> 02:31:48.474
"That's 25 gold pieces. Thank you."

02:31:48.474 --> 02:31:50.857
LAURA: And the celebone is how much, 100?

02:31:50.857 --> 02:31:52.033
MATT: "20."
TALIESIN: 20.

02:31:52.033 --> 02:31:54.075
LAURA: Oh, great.
MATT: "But if you buy a bunch of them,

02:31:54.075 --> 02:31:56.532
"you could have a real party, I'm just saying.

02:31:56.532 --> 02:31:58.697
"Lights from all over.

02:31:58.697 --> 02:32:00.464
"And you think one oops-stone's bad.

02:32:00.464 --> 02:32:02.657
"Imagine if you set off a bunch in an area."

02:32:02.657 --> 02:32:05.047
ASHLEY: How many do you have left? Of the oops-stones?

02:32:05.047 --> 02:32:09.180
MATT: "That was two for you, two for you, five for you.

02:32:10.647 --> 02:32:14.958
"26, that would put me at 17 left."

02:32:15.997 --> 02:32:19.787
ASHLEY: I think we should buy some for Nott,

02:32:19.787 --> 02:32:22.297
so she can give them as a present or--

02:32:22.297 --> 02:32:24.457
LAURA: Oh, that's true, I bet Luc would love something--

02:32:24.457 --> 02:32:26.440
ASHLEY: Yeah, I will--
MARISHA: Kiri.

02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:28.407
Kiri would love some.
LAURA: Kiri would love the oops-stones.

02:32:28.407 --> 02:32:30.107
Should we just buy all of--

02:32:30.107 --> 02:32:32.548
MARISHA: They're great gifts for kids.

02:32:32.548 --> 02:32:34.247
Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:32:34.247 --> 02:32:37.062
LIAM: Yeah, I will also take two celebones, please.

02:32:37.062 --> 02:32:38.357
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll have a celebone.
MATT: 40 gold.

02:32:38.357 --> 02:32:39.797
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: 20 gold.

02:32:39.797 --> 02:32:42.087
MARISHA: How many celebones did you have?

02:32:42.087 --> 02:32:43.697
MATT: "Total of 10."

02:32:43.697 --> 02:32:46.112
MARISHA: I mean, are we going to buy all the celebones?

02:32:46.112 --> 02:32:48.105
We're going to buy all the celebones.

02:32:48.105 --> 02:32:51.552
LAURA: That's 200 gold for the celebones.

02:32:51.552 --> 02:32:54.347
26 oops-stones, you said?

02:32:54.347 --> 02:32:55.180
MATT: "That is correct.

02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:56.517
"Five gold apiece."

02:32:56.517 --> 02:33:01.517
LAURA: 300 gold for all of the oops-stones, and how much,

02:33:01.537 --> 02:33:03.037
how many bags of chuckle dust?

02:33:03.037 --> 02:33:05.507
MATT: "11 total."
TRAVIS: Nerds and Lemonheads.

02:33:05.507 --> 02:33:07.095
LAURA: And they're 10 gold apiece?

02:33:07.095 --> 02:33:08.537
MATT: "That's correct."

02:33:08.537 --> 02:33:11.607
LAURA: So 110 gold for the chuckle dust?

02:33:11.607 --> 02:33:14.277
What if we bought the whole lot?

02:33:14.277 --> 02:33:18.102
You said you would give a discount for bulk buying.

02:33:18.102 --> 02:33:20.536
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

02:33:22.447 --> 02:33:24.934
SAM: I love this shop.
MARISHA: It's like a prank shop.

02:33:24.934 --> 02:33:26.037
It's great.
SAM: Yeah.

02:33:26.037 --> 02:33:27.056
MATT: Yeah, it's kind of--

02:33:27.056 --> 02:33:29.060
SAM: Oh, you forgot your fake dog poop.

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:30.337
(laughter)

02:33:30.337 --> 02:33:31.427
TALIESIN: Complimentary.
LAURA: 20.

02:33:31.427 --> 02:33:32.260
MATT: 20.

02:33:33.527 --> 02:33:37.307
MARISHA: Yeah, throw in a hand buzzer with every purchase.
MATT: "Tell you what...

02:33:37.307 --> 02:33:39.207
"Let's see here, that's..."

02:33:41.647 --> 02:33:43.888
TALIESIN: Wacky spinning bow tie.

02:33:44.767 --> 02:33:46.724
Squirting flower lapel.

02:33:46.724 --> 02:33:48.032
ASHLEY: Weasley's.

02:33:49.367 --> 02:33:53.895
MATT: "Give you the whole lot, with the ring included."

02:33:53.895 --> 02:33:54.740
LAURA: Oh.

02:33:55.882 --> 02:33:57.790
MATT: "If you want to.

02:33:59.661 --> 02:34:00.877
"5000."

02:34:02.186 --> 02:34:03.627
TRAVIS: There's that fucking number again.

02:34:03.627 --> 02:34:06.253
LAURA: 5000 for it all plus the ring?

02:34:13.417 --> 02:34:14.858
I mean, okay!

02:34:17.434 --> 02:34:19.233
Yeah, I'll do it.

02:34:19.233 --> 02:34:23.608
MATT: (thudding sounds)

02:34:23.608 --> 02:34:25.847
You guys have-- like this is...

02:34:27.217 --> 02:34:32.217
You look like you cleared out a Disneyland

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.507
shop, coming out of one of the rides.

02:34:35.507 --> 02:34:37.207
You're just, like, carrying bags and bags

02:34:37.207 --> 02:34:38.257
of all these different things.

02:34:38.257 --> 02:34:40.613
Half of them are lighting up.

02:34:41.907 --> 02:34:43.357
TRAVIS: Fiber optic swords.

02:34:43.357 --> 02:34:45.123
MARISHA: Here, I'll toss 500--
TALIESIN: During the parade,

02:34:45.123 --> 02:34:46.582
they're all synchronize up, it's great.

02:34:46.582 --> 02:34:48.757
MARISHA: -- to the purchase.

02:34:48.757 --> 02:34:50.648
LAURA: Oh, but I don't want you to.

02:34:50.648 --> 02:34:51.481
I was going to buy the ring,

02:34:51.481 --> 02:34:54.423
so I don't want you to have to put in 500 gold.

02:34:54.423 --> 02:34:56.177
LIAM: That is going toward ring.

02:34:56.177 --> 02:34:58.342
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine.

02:34:58.342 --> 02:35:01.277
I'm kind of like Veth. I've got so much money

02:35:01.277 --> 02:35:03.897
and I'm not like the wizard who has to buy so much paper.

02:35:03.897 --> 02:35:05.405
Like I'm pretty set, so--

02:35:05.405 --> 02:35:07.250
LIAM: I don't have a lot of money.

02:35:08.112 --> 02:35:09.957
MATT: Celebones, oops-stones, and chuckle dust

02:35:09.957 --> 02:35:11.304
are all in D&amp;D Beyond.

02:35:11.304 --> 02:35:12.137
You can go ahead and just add them

02:35:12.137 --> 02:35:13.017
to your character sheet if you want.

02:35:13.017 --> 02:35:14.165
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:35:14.165 --> 02:35:16.049
SAM: They exist?
MATT: Oh, I made them.

02:35:16.049 --> 02:35:18.837
SAM: Oh, you made them.
LAURA: Oh, that's fun.

02:35:19.844 --> 02:35:22.097
MATT: As well as the Ring of Spell-Splitting
should be on there.

02:35:22.097 --> 02:35:23.037
LAURA: Okay, awesome.

02:35:23.037 --> 02:35:24.899
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw you another a hundred gold.

02:35:24.899 --> 02:35:27.727
LAURA: Okay. Thank you, Caduceus.

02:35:27.727 --> 02:35:30.436
TRAVIS: These are all incredible items

02:35:30.436 --> 02:35:31.697
and we're very thankful for them.

02:35:31.697 --> 02:35:36.697
What might you have for more expensive clientele?

02:35:41.237 --> 02:35:42.617
MATT: "At the moment, not too much.

02:35:42.617 --> 02:35:47.207
"Kind of cleared me out as far as enchanted items.

02:35:47.207 --> 02:35:49.457
"Come back here maybe in a few weeks,

02:35:49.457 --> 02:35:52.857
"once more of the, you know, specialty soldiers

02:35:52.857 --> 02:35:55.537
"return from the front lines that borrowed all this shit

02:35:55.537 --> 02:35:58.437
"that was taken from me when war broke out.

02:35:58.437 --> 02:35:59.477
"Maybe I'll have more to sell."

02:35:59.477 --> 02:36:02.017
TRAVIS: How long has your shop been here in Rexxentrum?

02:36:02.017 --> 02:36:05.297
MATT: "Shop's been here about 60-some odd years,

02:36:05.297 --> 02:36:07.667
"but I've taken over the family business."

02:36:07.667 --> 02:36:09.397
TRAVIS: Six-zero, 60-some odd years?

02:36:09.397 --> 02:36:10.867
MATT: "Yeah."

02:36:10.867 --> 02:36:12.067
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:36:14.107 --> 02:36:14.940
Goodness.

02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:16.352
MATT: "My father passed.

02:36:17.327 --> 02:36:18.367
"Took over it for him."

02:36:18.367 --> 02:36:21.610
TRAVIS: That's wonderful. Family business.

02:36:23.867 --> 02:36:28.857
MATT: "Anybody interested in small clay doggies?

02:36:28.857 --> 02:36:30.507
"I've got a whole section over here."

02:36:30.507 --> 02:36:32.427
TRAVIS: Do they move?

02:36:32.427 --> 02:36:34.443
MATT: "If you make them."

02:36:34.443 --> 02:36:38.707
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: "(barks) Eh?"

02:36:38.707 --> 02:36:40.907
ASHLEY: How much are you selling them for?

02:36:40.907 --> 02:36:42.400
MATT: "Two silver apiece."

02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:44.662
ASHLEY: I'll take two.

02:36:44.662 --> 02:36:47.207
MATT: "All right, here you go."

02:36:47.207 --> 02:36:48.854
LIAM: Do you have a cat section?

02:36:48.854 --> 02:36:51.235
MATT: "Oh, right over there in the back."

02:36:51.235 --> 02:36:54.277
LIAM: I'll be back.
TALIESIN: I grab two celebones, just so you know.

02:36:54.277 --> 02:36:57.057
MATT: The cats, they all appear to be from the same maker,

02:36:57.057 --> 02:37:00.777
and the same maker has a weird idea of what cats look like.

02:37:00.777 --> 02:37:03.807
So they're all a little off in a similar way.

02:37:03.807 --> 02:37:05.967
Their necks are very long and curved

02:37:05.967 --> 02:37:09.757
to where it has a strange, like almost giraffe-like...

02:37:09.757 --> 02:37:11.867
You could interpret as an artistic choice

02:37:11.867 --> 02:37:13.777
except for the rest of it seems proportionally correct

02:37:13.777 --> 02:37:16.147
and it's just-- it's odd.

02:37:16.147 --> 02:37:17.297
LIAM: How big are they?

02:37:17.297 --> 02:37:18.807
MATT: They're about that big. They're little knickknacks.

02:37:18.807 --> 02:37:19.640
LIAM: Hmm.

02:37:21.297 --> 02:37:25.297
ASHLEY: Jester, I'm going to give you 50 gold,

02:37:25.297 --> 02:37:27.297
because could I have a celebone

02:37:27.297 --> 02:37:32.297
and a couple oops-stones and some chuckle dust?

02:37:32.396 --> 02:37:33.610
LAURA: Take it.

02:37:33.610 --> 02:37:37.327
TALIESIN: I got two celebones and
a chuckle dust, and I'm good.

02:37:37.327 --> 02:37:38.160
LAURA: Okay.

02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:40.827
ASHLEY: You know what, that's so fun to say.

02:37:40.827 --> 02:37:43.537
LAURA: Yeah, I just love all of this stuff so much.

02:37:43.537 --> 02:37:46.828
ASHLEY: Yeah. Celebone, oops-stone, chuckle dust.

02:37:46.828 --> 02:37:49.495
(laughter)

02:37:52.157 --> 02:37:54.237
TALIESIN: You got a ring, that's great.

02:37:54.237 --> 02:37:55.070
TRAVIS: I do.

02:37:56.577 --> 02:37:57.877
ASHLEY: You both have rings now.

02:37:59.037 --> 02:38:01.260
MATT: "So anything else I can help you with?"

02:38:04.667 --> 02:38:06.237
TALIESIN: I guess if you have a card, just in case

02:38:06.237 --> 02:38:08.777
we have to come back, that'd be great, or something.

02:38:08.777 --> 02:38:09.610
MATT: "Watch this.

02:38:12.057 --> 02:38:12.921
"Here you go."

02:38:12.921 --> 02:38:14.121
(laughter)

02:38:14.121 --> 02:38:15.854
MATT: "Didn't see that coming."
TALIESIN: I was expecting so much,

02:38:15.854 --> 02:38:16.945
and that was so much better.

02:38:16.945 --> 02:38:18.157
Thank you very much.

02:38:18.157 --> 02:38:19.857
ASHLEY: Where are you from?

02:38:19.857 --> 02:38:22.887
MATT: "From here. I grew up here."
ASHLEY: From here?

02:38:22.887 --> 02:38:24.777
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:38:24.777 --> 02:38:26.227
TRAVIS: Family-owned biz.

02:38:26.227 --> 02:38:28.767
MATT: "Yeah."
ASHLEY: Right, family owned business, I'm sorry.

02:38:28.767 --> 02:38:32.200
LIAM: Do you have any fine incense here?

02:38:33.387 --> 02:38:35.007
MATT: "Incense, yeah, certainly.

02:38:35.007 --> 02:38:35.840
"How much you want?"

02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:38.157
LIAM: 50 gold worth of incense.

02:38:38.157 --> 02:38:40.157
MATT: "Of course, of course, I'll get that for you."

02:38:40.157 --> 02:38:41.745
Packs it, brings it back.

02:38:41.745 --> 02:38:43.462
"Here you go."
LIAM: Five cats.

02:38:44.447 --> 02:38:46.917
Thank you. Oh, and I will take a card as well, please.

02:38:46.917 --> 02:38:47.750
MATT: "Oh, of course."

02:38:48.747 --> 02:38:52.460
The pageantry is done every single time.

02:38:53.404 --> 02:38:54.237
"Here you go."

02:38:54.237 --> 02:38:55.337
LIAM: How did you do that?

02:38:56.187 --> 02:38:58.087
MATT: "Magic."
LIAM: Wow.

02:38:58.087 --> 02:39:00.677
TRAVIS: In all of the antique sections,

02:39:00.677 --> 02:39:03.247
are there any porcelain unicorns

02:39:03.247 --> 02:39:05.607
or unicorn-type statues or toys?

02:39:05.607 --> 02:39:06.907
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:39:09.517 --> 02:39:10.837
TRAVIS: 14. 15.

02:39:10.837 --> 02:39:11.807
Oh, 15.

02:39:11.807 --> 02:39:16.210
MATT: You do see one, maybe inch and a half,

02:39:16.210 --> 02:39:19.127
adorably sculpted little porcelain unicorn.

02:39:19.127 --> 02:39:20.607
It looks like it's a little chipped,

02:39:20.607 --> 02:39:21.737
like it's been there for a while

02:39:21.737 --> 02:39:23.347
and seen better days.

02:39:23.347 --> 02:39:24.480
TRAVIS: How much for this?

02:39:26.107 --> 02:39:26.940
MATT: "Five copper."

02:39:27.787 --> 02:39:29.687
TRAVIS: Give her five copper.

02:39:33.171 --> 02:39:35.175
LAURA: And you wanted how many?

02:39:36.425 --> 02:39:39.186
TALIESIN: Two celebones, one chuckle dust.

02:39:39.186 --> 02:39:41.536
MATT: It's everything I wanted.
LIAM: This is a real conversation we're having.

02:39:41.536 --> 02:39:43.117
MATT: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: It's really hard to keep track.

02:39:43.117 --> 02:39:46.180
MARISHA: Two oops-stones, one celebone.

02:39:47.437 --> 02:39:49.027
ASHLEY: The chuckle dust is 10 gold apiece, right?

02:39:49.027 --> 02:39:50.547
MATT: Correct.

02:39:50.547 --> 02:39:53.507
(laughter)

02:39:53.507 --> 02:39:56.227
LAURA: And did you want any chuckle dust?

02:39:56.227 --> 02:39:58.357
MATT: I'm so happy.
MARISHA: Nah, I'm good.

02:39:58.357 --> 02:40:00.207
I make people laugh on my own.

02:40:00.207 --> 02:40:01.040
LAURA: Okay.

02:40:04.523 --> 02:40:07.283
SAM: And how much were those yuk yuk pockets again?

02:40:07.283 --> 02:40:10.687
(laughter)

02:40:10.687 --> 02:40:13.747
TRAVIS: Thank you. This has been a delightful treat.

02:40:13.747 --> 02:40:14.580
MATT: "Of course."

02:40:15.857 --> 02:40:17.187
TRAVIS: Shall we?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:40:17.187 --> 02:40:18.845
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: "Certainly.

02:40:18.845 --> 02:40:20.256
"Hopefully in a few weeks, come on back.

02:40:20.256 --> 02:40:21.677
"We'll have a lot more to choose from;

02:40:21.677 --> 02:40:23.087
"it'll be great.

02:40:23.087 --> 02:40:24.665
"Please?"

02:40:24.665 --> 02:40:26.338
ASHLEY: We will be back.
TALIESIN: Thank you, yeah.

02:40:26.338 --> 02:40:28.167
ASHLEY: This is great.

02:40:28.167 --> 02:40:29.647
LAURA: Maybe we can go to the Assembly

02:40:29.647 --> 02:40:31.367
and ask them to give us some of the stuff

02:40:31.367 --> 02:40:34.027
that they procured.

02:40:34.027 --> 02:40:35.780
I mean, we did help out, right?

02:40:37.857 --> 02:40:40.057
TRAVIS: Well, I think supplies, that sounds like

02:40:40.057 --> 02:40:42.665
they were stocking up for the war effort.

02:40:42.665 --> 02:40:43.498
LAURA: Yeah.

02:40:46.362 --> 02:40:47.820
TRAVIS: What would we ask them for,

02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:49.217
and why would we need it?

02:40:49.217 --> 02:40:51.677
LIAM: Do I know if they had any sort of

02:40:51.677 --> 02:40:55.947
Assembly-sanctioned goods?

02:40:55.947 --> 02:40:59.897
Or does the Assembly just keep everything on lockdown

02:40:59.897 --> 02:41:03.140
for the Empire's use and not for sale?

02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:06.057
What would I remember?

02:41:06.057 --> 02:41:08.368
MATT: From what your experience would tell you,

02:41:11.647 --> 02:41:14.600
the Assembly doesn't lock it down.

02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:17.367
A lot of the more powerful stuff is essentially

02:41:17.367 --> 02:41:20.137
relegated to Assembly-sanctioned use.

02:41:20.137 --> 02:41:21.567
They want to control who has access

02:41:21.567 --> 02:41:23.607
to which powerful magical items and artifacts

02:41:23.607 --> 02:41:25.260
are located or created.

02:41:27.237 --> 02:41:30.127
On record, keep tabs on it, so they know who has what,

02:41:30.127 --> 02:41:32.937
and, you know, in case anybody they know of

02:41:32.937 --> 02:41:34.597
who has any powerful item starts getting weird

02:41:34.597 --> 02:41:36.077
or goes rogue from their interests,

02:41:36.077 --> 02:41:37.808
they know what to be wary of.

02:41:39.807 --> 02:41:41.457
But there are, you know, like this shop,

02:41:41.457 --> 02:41:45.467
and specific individuals have been commissioned,

02:41:45.467 --> 02:41:49.177
but if they're underneath the banner of the Assembly,

02:41:49.177 --> 02:41:51.167
then everything has to go through approvals.

02:41:51.167 --> 02:41:53.667
There's paperwork involved,

02:41:53.667 --> 02:41:57.542
and in times of war,

02:41:57.542 --> 02:41:59.797
at least from what it seems, a lot of that is

02:41:59.797 --> 02:42:02.447
essentially cut off, and then everything is relegated

02:42:02.447 --> 02:42:03.587
to the war effort.
LIAM: Got it.

02:42:03.587 --> 02:42:05.137
MATT: And it's just slowly trickling back

02:42:05.137 --> 02:42:07.167
to its previous normal.

02:42:07.167 --> 02:42:10.637
LIAM: So we're not going to go-- there's no storefront

02:42:10.637 --> 02:42:12.607
with an Assembly sign on it.

02:42:12.607 --> 02:42:14.487
MATT: No, almost everything is commissioned

02:42:14.487 --> 02:42:15.967
based on specific individuals.

02:42:15.967 --> 02:42:19.047
That's why this shop is pretty rare in its own right.

02:42:19.047 --> 02:42:21.147
It doesn't delve in powerful artifacts,

02:42:21.147 --> 02:42:24.377
it does more simple and common magics

02:42:24.377 --> 02:42:27.287
with the occasional item that comes through, it seems.

02:42:27.287 --> 02:42:31.770
But that's why it's not as heavily regulated.

02:42:38.347 --> 02:42:39.697
LIAM: All right, well, let's--

02:42:43.347 --> 02:42:46.007
Do we need to message to DeRogna again,

02:42:46.007 --> 02:42:48.557
or would Caleb know where she'd be hanging?

02:42:48.557 --> 02:42:51.237
MATT: You'd know vaguely where she was.

02:42:51.237 --> 02:42:53.978
You had been there long enough to know--

02:42:53.978 --> 02:42:55.957
You know the members of the Assembly,

02:42:55.957 --> 02:42:59.817
and could quickly ascertain which of their towers

02:42:59.817 --> 02:43:04.000
in the Candles there is theirs, so.

02:43:05.437 --> 02:43:08.570
LIAM: Okay, well, let's do our little walkabout still.

02:43:10.717 --> 02:43:15.197
Are we halfway to the Academy at this point?

02:43:15.197 --> 02:43:18.000
MATT: You guys are getting close
to the edge of the Shimmer Ward.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:22.997
You do come past now the Chantry of the Dawn,

02:43:22.997 --> 02:43:27.757
the cathedral, which you wanted to check in on, Yasha.

02:43:27.757 --> 02:43:32.757
The beautiful exterior remains as you recall seeing it.

02:43:33.387 --> 02:43:36.247
There are repair crews working on it currently,

02:43:36.247 --> 02:43:38.537
as there was damage sustained to the structure,

02:43:38.537 --> 02:43:40.537
as well as the stained glass windows

02:43:40.537 --> 02:43:43.690
in the back of the entire temple were destroyed.

02:43:44.567 --> 02:43:46.737
So a lot of the damage is still under repair.

02:43:46.737 --> 02:43:48.647
The stained glass windows are still out.

02:43:48.647 --> 02:43:50.700
That's going to take a while to replace.

02:43:52.157 --> 02:43:54.917
It looks like a lot of it's been roped off,

02:43:54.917 --> 02:43:57.137
and most individuals that come to still do

02:43:57.137 --> 02:44:00.577
their worship of the Dawn Father

02:44:00.577 --> 02:44:03.487
do so more in the foyer area.

02:44:03.487 --> 02:44:06.978
So it's temporarily a much more

02:44:06.978 --> 02:44:09.017
diminished temple,

02:44:09.017 --> 02:44:11.460
but still functional for those who need it.

02:44:12.307 --> 02:44:14.187
But as you walk by,

02:44:14.187 --> 02:44:15.957
if you wanted to try and get inside of it,

02:44:15.957 --> 02:44:17.617
you can only get as far as that entryway,

02:44:17.617 --> 02:44:21.414
which you guys snuck past when you initially encountered it.

02:44:21.414 --> 02:44:23.387
LAURA: What about my little tunnel that I painted?

02:44:23.387 --> 02:44:24.912
Is it still there?

02:44:25.869 --> 02:44:27.620
MATT: You go and check?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:44:27.620 --> 02:44:30.097
MATT: As you go over, no, it actually has been

02:44:30.097 --> 02:44:33.267
freshly masoned shut, as it was considered

02:44:33.267 --> 02:44:35.373
damage sustained in the battle.

02:44:38.797 --> 02:44:40.094
But it is odd.

02:44:40.094 --> 02:44:44.727
It's odd to walk back and

02:44:44.727 --> 02:44:46.467
have those memories flash back.

02:44:46.467 --> 02:44:48.917
It begins this link chain of remembering

02:44:48.917 --> 02:44:53.077
the last time you were here, when you reclaimed yourself,

02:44:53.077 --> 02:44:57.967
and then memories of Obann's influence,

02:44:57.967 --> 02:45:00.667
memories of the creatures you walked alongside,

02:45:00.667 --> 02:45:04.097
memories of the intent that you were being driven towards

02:45:04.097 --> 02:45:08.247
that was not your own, memories and flashes

02:45:08.247 --> 02:45:13.247
of even times that you had

02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:14.330
locked from your mind

02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:19.235
images of being in rainy plains of Xhorhas,

02:45:19.235 --> 02:45:20.693
images of being in rainy plains of Xhorhas,

02:45:20.693 --> 02:45:23.197
heavily bundled with a cloak, your sword behind you,

02:45:23.197 --> 02:45:28.197
as you walk from the outskirts of some sort of an outpost

02:45:28.707 --> 02:45:33.707
left in flames, being quelled by the rainfall

02:45:33.787 --> 02:45:35.997
as Obann comes up and touches your shoulder and says,

02:45:35.997 --> 02:45:37.768
"Well done."

02:45:39.887 --> 02:45:42.617
There's still elements of that trauma

02:45:42.617 --> 02:45:44.947
and that time that you can't fully recall.

02:45:44.947 --> 02:45:49.637
And for a moment that makes you a little dry of mouth

02:45:49.637 --> 02:45:51.562
and nauseous of stomach.

02:45:52.457 --> 02:45:54.557
But then you remember what you did to him,

02:45:55.667 --> 02:46:00.550
and how he was left, and you (inhale)--

02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:04.292
(music intensifies)
MATT: -- feel better about the moment.

02:46:08.223 --> 02:46:09.590
LAURA: (mimics music)

02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:11.867
MATT: Yeah. The music got a little
more intense than I expected.

02:46:11.867 --> 02:46:14.897
(laughter)

02:46:14.897 --> 02:46:17.525
TRAVIS: Did you want to go inside?

02:46:18.997 --> 02:46:20.347
MARISHA: Can we?

02:46:22.447 --> 02:46:23.864
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm...

02:46:25.537 --> 02:46:28.697
I don't need to, but I mean, can we even go inside?

02:46:28.697 --> 02:46:31.807
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know if--
ASHLEY: I think it is roped off.

02:46:31.807 --> 02:46:34.802
TRAVIS: That giant window's open. I'm sure we could--

02:46:34.802 --> 02:46:36.577
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, not that that ever stopped us

02:46:36.577 --> 02:46:41.127
if we wanted to, but it's up to you. Are you all right?

02:46:41.127 --> 02:46:42.875
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm okay.

02:46:44.887 --> 02:46:48.062
I don't think-- I don't feel like I need to go in there.

02:46:50.337 --> 02:46:52.679
But I'm glad it's being repaired.

02:46:55.037 --> 02:46:56.945
MARISHA: You did good work here.

02:46:59.146 --> 02:47:00.704
ASHLEY: Well...
MARISHA: Well...

02:47:02.387 --> 02:47:05.187
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: You know, retrospectively.

02:47:05.187 --> 02:47:07.053
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think so.

02:47:07.053 --> 02:47:11.137
And I'm also glad that I did not kill you.

02:47:11.137 --> 02:47:12.497
MARISHA: Me, too.

02:47:12.497 --> 02:47:14.537
ASHLEY: Yeah. Or any of you.

02:47:14.537 --> 02:47:16.657
MARISHA: I'm glad we didn't kill you.

02:47:16.657 --> 02:47:20.093
LIAM: Came out stronger than when you went in.

02:47:20.093 --> 02:47:23.237
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's for sure.

02:47:23.237 --> 02:47:27.387
I think I am being rebuilt, just like the temple.

02:47:28.288 --> 02:47:31.297
MATT: There's a chill as you conjecture

02:47:31.297 --> 02:47:36.291
and remember that you're still wearing that darkened armor

02:47:36.291 --> 02:47:37.724
and remember that you're still wearing that darkened armor

02:47:37.724 --> 02:47:40.032
that Obann placed upon you.

02:47:46.451 --> 02:47:49.034
ASHLEY: (sighs)

02:47:50.010 --> 02:47:53.167
Do you guys want to move on?

02:47:53.167 --> 02:47:55.657
MARISHA: I'm kind of hungry.

02:47:55.657 --> 02:47:57.267
LIAM: I know a place.

02:47:57.267 --> 02:47:58.460
MARISHA: Yeah?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:00.197
LAURA: Grab some food, go see Vess?

02:48:00.197 --> 02:48:01.637
LIAM: Yeah.

02:48:01.637 --> 02:48:05.247
I will lead them over to the Academy.

02:48:05.247 --> 02:48:06.080
MATT: Okay.

02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:09.217
LIAM: And I will also try to-- we'll start there,

02:48:09.217 --> 02:48:12.677
but after that, I'd like to find that the dance hall

02:48:12.677 --> 02:48:15.277
and beer hall that I used to escape to occasionally

02:48:15.277 --> 02:48:18.497
with Astrid and Eodwulf.
MATT: Okay.

02:48:18.497 --> 02:48:22.397
Now you still have the papers that were given to you

02:48:23.257 --> 02:48:24.647
after your meeting with the king,

02:48:24.647 --> 02:48:28.197
and Ludinus gave you some ability

02:48:28.197 --> 02:48:30.737
to travel throughout Rexxentrum without issue

02:48:30.737 --> 02:48:32.057
while you were still under the watch.

02:48:32.057 --> 02:48:34.017
It hasn't been returned yet, but there was

02:48:34.017 --> 02:48:36.052
no expiration date.

02:48:36.052 --> 02:48:37.717
So as you walk towards the Shimmer Ward,

02:48:37.717 --> 02:48:41.137
there is a brief moment where there's some odd eyes

02:48:41.137 --> 02:48:44.087
as to these strangers walking into the more

02:48:45.687 --> 02:48:50.517
wealthy portion of the city, but with a brief discussion

02:48:50.517 --> 02:48:51.377
you're let inside.

02:48:51.377 --> 02:48:52.447
And you've been here once before,

02:48:52.447 --> 02:48:55.930
though you were being escorted towards the Ungebroch Castle

02:48:56.947 --> 02:49:00.767
within the terrace here, following Caleb's lead,

02:49:00.767 --> 02:49:05.767
you make your way towards the actual Academy Grounds,

02:49:05.827 --> 02:49:08.467
and you've seen this from a distance, but now up close,

02:49:08.467 --> 02:49:11.197
you can see the beautiful ivory towers and halls

02:49:11.197 --> 02:49:14.417
that intersect and lead into the large central building

02:49:14.417 --> 02:49:17.527
that is the Soltryce Academy proper,

02:49:17.527 --> 02:49:19.697
the beautiful verdant gardens and courtyards

02:49:19.697 --> 02:49:22.667
that surround it and seem to actually

02:49:22.667 --> 02:49:24.277
live within elements of it.

02:49:24.277 --> 02:49:26.547
There are greenhouse sections

02:49:26.547 --> 02:49:29.327
between the larger portions of the lead structure,

02:49:29.327 --> 02:49:34.195
where you can see interior greenery is kept beautifully.

02:49:35.037 --> 02:49:37.837
You can see students in robes out in the courtyard

02:49:37.837 --> 02:49:40.467
in the process of reading, you can see classes taking tours,

02:49:40.467 --> 02:49:43.407
you can see upon one of the towers

02:49:43.407 --> 02:49:48.367
there is a large stone sphere

02:49:48.367 --> 02:49:52.857
that itself is encased in a brass lattice

02:49:52.857 --> 02:49:55.017
that is slowly spinning in place

02:49:55.017 --> 02:49:56.547
and there is some sort of a lecture going on

02:49:56.547 --> 02:49:59.107
around it up there, and occasionally you see

02:49:59.107 --> 02:50:02.277
sparks off of it, as they can barely hear

02:50:02.277 --> 02:50:05.467
the muffled sounds of this lecture in the distance.

02:50:05.467 --> 02:50:06.300
It is beautiful.

02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:08.737
It is larger than anything you originally had imagined

02:50:08.737 --> 02:50:11.247
when you had first heard of the Soltryce Academy.

02:50:11.247 --> 02:50:13.877
And once again, that odd, echoing ghost

02:50:13.877 --> 02:50:16.487
of there being once a time that this was really

02:50:16.487 --> 02:50:20.197
the only goal you had, and yet for as large as it is,

02:50:20.197 --> 02:50:22.327
and as beautiful as it is, it still seems so small

02:50:22.327 --> 02:50:25.367
in comparison to everything you've seen since.

02:50:26.957 --> 02:50:30.117
Odd memories flood to you, good times,

02:50:30.117 --> 02:50:33.408
weird times, bad times,

02:50:33.408 --> 02:50:37.133
and you all can't help but notice

02:50:37.133 --> 02:50:39.997
the wash that comes over Caleb

02:50:39.997 --> 02:50:44.917
as his face goes a little slack with memory

02:50:46.317 --> 02:50:50.093
before you usher them on to your favorite drinking hole.

02:50:50.093 --> 02:50:53.857
LIAM: As we were leaving the grounds,
I point a few things out.

02:50:53.857 --> 02:50:57.507
That is where my room was at.

02:50:57.507 --> 02:51:00.377
And then there's another room that I spent

02:51:00.377 --> 02:51:02.277
a lot of time in there.

02:51:02.277 --> 02:51:03.976
LAURA: What is that one?

02:51:03.976 --> 02:51:05.618
LIAM: Those are the dorms.

02:51:07.927 --> 02:51:10.399
LAURA: Whose room was the second one?

02:51:10.399 --> 02:51:11.738
LIAM: (small sad laugh)

02:51:11.738 --> 02:51:13.079
LAURA: (giggles)

02:51:14.387 --> 02:51:16.515
LIAM: So young. Most of them.

02:51:18.077 --> 02:51:19.517
Not everyone is young, though.

02:51:19.517 --> 02:51:23.171
It's not too late if you'd like to apply.

02:51:23.171 --> 02:51:24.616
TRAVIS: (wheezes)

02:51:24.616 --> 02:51:26.537
You know, I think...

02:51:26.537 --> 02:51:27.897
I think I'm okay.

02:51:27.897 --> 02:51:30.824
ASHLEY: Oh, you wanted to go to school here.

02:51:30.824 --> 02:51:33.747
MARISHA: Yeah, that was our first mission.

02:51:33.747 --> 02:51:34.708
LAURA: Yeah.

02:51:34.708 --> 02:51:36.968
MARISHA: Was to get you a scholarship.

02:51:36.968 --> 02:51:38.448
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh my god.

02:51:38.448 --> 02:51:41.382
LAURA: I still have that piece of paper

02:51:41.382 --> 02:51:42.917
for your recommendation letter.

02:51:42.917 --> 02:51:44.175
MARISHA: That's right.

02:51:44.175 --> 02:51:48.050
TRAVIS: I didn't know anything about my abilities or magic,

02:51:48.050 --> 02:51:51.510
and I just figured that was where you went to learn.

02:51:52.897 --> 02:51:54.530
LIAM: Well, you have the talent.

02:51:56.107 --> 02:51:57.907
You have the potential.

02:51:59.807 --> 02:52:02.197
TRAVIS: You know, I think I'm okay.

02:52:02.197 --> 02:52:06.210
LIAM: You might like it, though. It's an exciting place.

02:52:07.357 --> 02:52:11.920
A lot of bright minds and a lot of magic.

02:52:13.537 --> 02:52:15.970
TRAVIS: You still have a reverence for it.

02:52:19.696 --> 02:52:20.570
LIAM: I do.

02:52:22.417 --> 02:52:23.250
I do.

02:52:25.323 --> 02:52:28.620
Yeah, all kinds of people come through here.

02:52:29.919 --> 02:52:31.519
I was lucky enough to be chosen.

02:52:33.697 --> 02:52:38.439
Many, their parents pay their way here.

02:52:38.439 --> 02:52:39.338
It's not all magic.

02:52:39.338 --> 02:52:41.807
Some are just making sure that they can get

02:52:41.807 --> 02:52:44.344
a better standing here in Rexxentrum.

02:52:47.417 --> 02:52:50.017
But brilliant minds have come out of this place

02:52:50.017 --> 02:52:52.662
and great things have been achieved.

02:52:55.927 --> 02:52:58.407
We are going to be dealing with these folk quite a bit,

02:52:58.407 --> 02:52:59.602
so soak it in.

02:53:00.917 --> 02:53:02.448
Points up at a tower.

02:53:03.481 --> 02:53:06.094
Spent a lot of time in that one, too.

02:53:06.094 --> 02:53:08.857
And then I start to walk away from the grounds.

02:53:08.857 --> 02:53:11.187
LAURA: What does that tower look like?
MARISHA: Is it Trent's?

02:53:11.187 --> 02:53:13.077
Is that the one we saw before?

02:53:13.077 --> 02:53:14.093
MATT: No.

02:53:18.547 --> 02:53:21.014
LIAM: Caleb does not elaborate.

02:53:21.014 --> 02:53:21.847
LAURA: What does it look like?

02:53:21.847 --> 02:53:23.417
What did that tower look like?

02:53:23.417 --> 02:53:25.017
LIAM: Well...

02:53:26.808 --> 02:53:30.049
I would only know the inside thoroughly.

02:53:30.049 --> 02:53:31.377
MATT: So which tower is this?

02:53:31.377 --> 02:53:36.377
LIAM: The one place where we would be locked here.

02:53:36.427 --> 02:53:39.497
MATT: It looks not dissimilar from the other towers.

02:53:39.497 --> 02:53:41.997
It's not remarkable from the outside.

02:53:41.997 --> 02:53:45.448
It isn't like a specific, like, this is the darker tower.

02:53:46.367 --> 02:53:47.557
It's just a tower.

02:53:47.557 --> 02:53:51.728
But his tone is enough to make you go, hmm.

02:53:54.847 --> 02:53:56.974
LIAM: But not too far,

02:53:56.974 --> 02:53:58.517
a few blocks down this way, is a place

02:53:58.517 --> 02:54:00.571
that I used to come to a lot.

02:54:00.571 --> 02:54:03.497
Well, not a lot, but when I would have free time,

02:54:03.497 --> 02:54:05.727
when we would have free time, we would come here

02:54:05.727 --> 02:54:08.367
and dance, and drink.

02:54:08.367 --> 02:54:09.375
LAURA: Astrid.

02:54:09.375 --> 02:54:12.697
LIAM: Uh-huh, yeah, and Eodwulf, my friend Eodwulf.

02:54:14.357 --> 02:54:15.662
ASHLEY: You would dance?

02:54:16.587 --> 02:54:19.003
LAURA: Caleb's a very good dancer.

02:54:19.003 --> 02:54:22.717
ASHLEY: Seemed a little reluctant in Rumblecusp, but...

02:54:22.717 --> 02:54:26.522
LIAM: Well, I like more structure.

02:54:27.639 --> 02:54:31.480
Not really a Martha Graham type.

02:54:32.337 --> 02:54:33.557
No.

02:54:33.557 --> 02:54:38.467
LAURA: I start waltzing by myself, outside.

02:54:39.597 --> 02:54:40.847
LIAM: Come in, come in.

02:54:43.491 --> 02:54:47.175
And I will lead them up to the main bar and get

02:54:49.047 --> 02:54:53.796
very large mugs, like this high, just of beer.

02:54:53.796 --> 02:54:56.407
And I pay for it, and I just start putting

02:54:56.407 --> 02:54:59.877
gigantic steins of beer in everyone's hands.

02:54:59.877 --> 02:55:01.587
So first, you have to drink everything

02:55:01.587 --> 02:55:03.817
that's in those glasses.

02:55:03.817 --> 02:55:05.312
Yeah, you, too.

02:55:06.467 --> 02:55:09.262
TALIESIN: Oh, this is a thing, all right.

02:55:09.262 --> 02:55:11.598
SAM: Welcome to Fuddruckers. Can I take your order?

02:55:11.598 --> 02:55:15.428
(laughter)

02:55:15.428 --> 02:55:17.579
LIAM: This is <i>Hofbräuhaus</i>.

02:55:19.852 --> 02:55:21.547
So, drink your beers and then we'll have a dance

02:55:21.547 --> 02:55:23.752
and then we'll go get some business done.

02:55:24.687 --> 02:55:25.520
TRAVIS: I like it.

02:55:26.509 --> 02:55:27.960
How do you say...?

02:55:28.949 --> 02:55:30.714
LIAM: <i>Prost</i>.
TRAVIS: <i>Prost</i>.

02:55:30.714 --> 02:55:32.638
LIAM: <i>Prost</i>, yeah.
LAURA: <i>Prost</i>!

02:55:32.638 --> 02:55:35.700
TRAVIS: <i>Prost</i>.
MARISHA and ASHLEY: <i>Prost</i>.

02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:37.672
TALIESIN: <i>Prost</i>.

02:55:37.672 --> 02:55:40.780
TRAVIS: (gulping) Who drinks the fastest?

02:55:41.827 --> 02:55:44.207
MATT: I dunno, everyone roll a constitution check.

02:55:44.207 --> 02:55:45.115
SAM: Yeah.

02:55:47.558 --> 02:55:48.624
ASHLEY: Cocked.

02:55:49.900 --> 02:55:53.087
MATT: Not a saving throw, a check, so add the modifier.

02:55:53.087 --> 02:55:54.497
TRAVIS: 17.

02:55:54.497 --> 02:55:55.330
LIAM: 11.

02:55:56.267 --> 02:55:57.439
ASHLEY: Natural one.

02:55:57.439 --> 02:55:59.207
(laughter)
TRAVIS: What??

02:55:59.207 --> 02:56:00.847
TALIESIN: 19.

02:56:00.847 --> 02:56:01.680
MARISHA: 11.

02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:03.077
ASHLEY: I don't know what's happening.
LAURA: 21.

02:56:03.077 --> 02:56:04.254
TRAVIS: Oh!

02:56:04.254 --> 02:56:06.677
MATT: Jester is the first to finish before

02:56:06.677 --> 02:56:08.748
slamming the glass down.

02:56:10.817 --> 02:56:12.557
You all finish and cheer, oh!

02:56:12.557 --> 02:56:13.967
You're all looking at Jester and you're having that moment

02:56:13.967 --> 02:56:15.357
of like, holy shit, and then you all look over

02:56:15.357 --> 02:56:18.136
and notice that Yasha's still just taking her time.

02:56:18.136 --> 02:56:21.017
(laughter)

02:56:21.017 --> 02:56:22.167
Savoring it.

02:56:24.557 --> 02:56:25.707
Pinky out.

02:56:27.937 --> 02:56:31.647
It's one silver per, so six silver for the round.

02:56:31.647 --> 02:56:33.208
LIAM: Oh no, bankrupt.

02:56:36.257 --> 02:56:37.090
Okay.

02:56:37.090 --> 02:56:39.837
And I start walking out onto the dance floor,

02:56:39.837 --> 02:56:42.567
and I nudge Jester towards Fjord,

02:56:42.567 --> 02:56:44.547
and I take Beauregard by the hand,

02:56:44.547 --> 02:56:46.928
and I began to waltz Beauregard.

02:56:46.928 --> 02:56:49.107
MARISHA: I hate this shit, you know I hate the shit.

02:56:49.107 --> 02:56:50.837
LIAM: That's all right.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:56:50.837 --> 02:56:53.547
LIAM: I will lead, for once, and follow, for once.

02:56:53.547 --> 02:56:55.067
MARISHA: All right.
TRAVIS: You know how to do this?

02:56:55.067 --> 02:56:56.454
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

02:56:56.454 --> 02:56:58.517
LAURA: Put your hands here so it
looks like you're leading me.

02:56:58.517 --> 02:57:00.003
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: Okay.

02:57:00.003 --> 02:57:02.489
(chuckling)

02:57:02.489 --> 02:57:04.307
LIAM: Thank you.

02:57:04.307 --> 02:57:05.923
MARISHA: What, for what?

02:57:05.923 --> 02:57:07.116
LIAM: You know.

02:57:11.077 --> 02:57:13.097
For making a difference.

02:57:13.097 --> 02:57:14.149
For being my friend.

02:57:14.149 --> 02:57:16.717
For being patient.

02:57:18.227 --> 02:57:20.642
For walking into the lion's den with me.

02:57:22.257 --> 02:57:24.257
Expositor Lionett.

02:57:25.447 --> 02:57:26.830
MARISHA: It's where I belong.

02:57:30.867 --> 02:57:32.237
I'm glad we're friends.

02:57:32.237 --> 02:57:36.377
I know it was a rocky start.

02:57:36.377 --> 02:57:37.697
LIAM: I don't know what you're talking about.

02:57:37.697 --> 02:57:38.947
MARISHA: Yeah, we were always great.

02:57:38.947 --> 02:57:39.822
LIAM: We were always great.

02:57:39.822 --> 02:57:42.327
MARISHA: Yeah, it was all in good fun.

02:57:42.327 --> 02:57:44.027
LIAM: You drove me insane.

02:57:44.027 --> 02:57:45.597
MARISHA: I hated you.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:57:45.597 --> 02:57:47.452
MARISHA: Yeah, you sucked.

02:57:47.452 --> 02:57:50.287
(laughter)

02:57:50.287 --> 02:57:55.175
MARISHA: But I tend to appreciate that.

02:57:56.037 --> 02:57:57.587
LIAM: Try to keep up with the pace, please.

02:57:57.587 --> 02:57:58.764
MARISHA: Okay.

02:57:58.764 --> 02:58:01.103
MATT: (laughs)

02:58:01.103 --> 02:58:02.336
MARISHA: Oh shit, sorry.

02:58:03.594 --> 02:58:04.677
LIAM: It's all right.

02:58:04.677 --> 02:58:07.577
LAURA: As Fjord and I are dancing,

02:58:07.577 --> 02:58:10.247
we're making circles around the room, I'm assuming?

02:58:10.247 --> 02:58:11.080
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:58:11.957 --> 02:58:13.437
LAURA: As we reach one side of the room,

02:58:13.437 --> 02:58:15.887
I reached into my pocket and I drop an oops-stone

02:58:15.887 --> 02:58:16.977
and keep on dancing.

02:58:16.977 --> 02:58:19.767
(laughter)

02:58:19.767 --> 02:58:21.350
MARISHA: Yes!
MATT: All right.

02:58:22.247 --> 02:58:23.858
So have you checked what it does on D&amp;D Beyond?

02:58:23.858 --> 02:58:26.057
LAURA: Yes. Yes.
SAM: (fart noise)

02:58:26.057 --> 02:58:29.640
MATT: The impact, silently,

02:58:30.582 --> 02:58:32.040
the 20-foot radius vicinity

02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:35.109
of the stone--
TRAVIS: 20-foot radius.

02:58:35.109 --> 02:58:38.357
MATT: -- becomes noxious odor.

02:58:38.357 --> 02:58:41.407
Other people that are, like, afternoon dancing,

02:58:41.407 --> 02:58:44.197
and just in the process of enjoying

02:58:44.197 --> 02:58:47.805
the later part of the day, all begin just--

02:58:47.805 --> 02:58:49.938
(coughing).

02:58:49.938 --> 02:58:52.545
"Oh!" They start shouting at each other in

02:58:55.079 --> 02:58:57.444
all sorts of angered curses,

02:58:57.444 --> 02:59:02.044
some in Common, some in Zemnian,

02:59:03.535 --> 02:59:05.654
but quickly the dance floor is--

02:59:05.654 --> 02:59:07.877
MARISHA: I can understand them all now,

02:59:07.877 --> 02:59:09.887
thanks to Tongue of the Sun and Moon.

02:59:09.887 --> 02:59:11.870
I just hear, "Oh, fucking shit!"

02:59:11.870 --> 02:59:14.042
MATT: Yeah, you pick up all the curses.

02:59:14.042 --> 02:59:15.647
That's true, that's true.

02:59:15.647 --> 02:59:18.127
The dance floor scatters and it's just

02:59:18.127 --> 02:59:21.597
you all dancing on the outskirts of the smell,

02:59:21.597 --> 02:59:23.007
and a bunch of people who are like, "What the hell?"

02:59:23.007 --> 02:59:26.340
They haven't even figured-- they
haven't found the stone source yet,

02:59:26.340 --> 02:59:28.522
but they're all just like, "Oh, god!'

02:59:28.522 --> 02:59:29.940
One of the servers goes like, "Ugh!"

02:59:29.940 --> 02:59:31.997
is like retching in the corner.

02:59:31.997 --> 02:59:34.314
TRAVIS: Jester, was that a gift from Thaydeen's,

02:59:34.314 --> 02:59:36.429
or should I just be very impressed?

02:59:37.417 --> 02:59:38.827
LAURA: It was just one of the stones.

02:59:38.827 --> 02:59:40.617
Don't worry, Fjord.

02:59:40.617 --> 02:59:42.857
I would tell you if I really had to oops.

02:59:42.857 --> 02:59:45.257
TRAVIS: That's incredible.

02:59:45.257 --> 02:59:47.347
(muffled tiny voice) "Oh, by the way, hold on. Let--"

02:59:47.347 --> 02:59:48.480
(normal voice) Do you hear that?

02:59:49.490 --> 02:59:51.123
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: There's something...

02:59:51.123 --> 02:59:53.481
"Let me-- oh, let me go be with Jester."

02:59:53.481 --> 02:59:55.044
Do you hear the voice?
LAURA: Yeah, I hear it, I hear it.

02:59:55.044 --> 02:59:57.147
TRAVIS: And I'll take out the little porcelain unicorn

02:59:57.147 --> 02:59:58.554
and be like, oh.

02:59:58.554 --> 02:59:59.650
LAURA: (gasps)

02:59:59.650 --> 03:00:01.807
TRAVIS: I think that's for you.

03:00:02.813 --> 03:00:04.569
LAURA: Where did you get this?!

03:00:04.569 --> 03:00:08.331
TRAVIS: I don't know. He was just trapped in my pocket.

03:00:08.331 --> 03:00:10.157
LAURA: Oh, I love him!

03:00:10.157 --> 03:00:14.583
TRAVIS: Yeah, just don't drop any oops-stones, okay?

03:00:14.583 --> 03:00:16.480
LAURA: (as unicorn) "Thank you for giving me to Jester!"

03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:17.707
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:00:17.707 --> 03:00:19.070
Can we go back towards the other end?

03:00:19.070 --> 03:00:20.896
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fjord!

03:00:20.896 --> 03:00:21.957
I give him a kiss on the cheek.

03:00:21.957 --> 03:00:23.717
Thank you so much.

03:00:23.717 --> 03:00:24.700
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

03:00:24.700 --> 03:00:29.700
LIAM: I swing past the other couple and push Beauregard

03:00:29.727 --> 03:00:31.277
towards Jester and I grabbed Fjord's hand

03:00:31.277 --> 03:00:34.377
and begin to lead Fjord around the room.

03:00:34.377 --> 03:00:35.837
Did she drop one of those stones?

03:00:35.837 --> 03:00:38.207
TRAVIS: She did, yeah. It was Jester.
LAURA: (as unicorn) "Would you like this dance?"

03:00:38.207 --> 03:00:40.827
MARISHA: Oh, it's so cute!
LIAM: Okay, well.

03:00:40.827 --> 03:00:42.237
I think we should stay another two minutes

03:00:42.237 --> 03:00:43.797
and then we should get out of here.

03:00:43.797 --> 03:00:44.865
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

03:00:44.865 --> 03:00:46.737
LIAM: Well, it smells very bad.

03:00:46.737 --> 03:00:49.675
TRAVIS: Oh!
(laughter)

03:00:49.675 --> 03:00:50.727
LAURA: I shout over my shoulder.

03:00:50.727 --> 03:00:52.637
It goes away soon, don't worry.

03:00:52.637 --> 03:00:54.724
LIAM: Nostalgia only goes so far.

03:00:54.724 --> 03:00:58.316
(laughter)

03:01:00.977 --> 03:01:04.167
TALIESIN: Sitting with Yasha on the edge of this, watching.

03:01:04.167 --> 03:01:08.930
ASHLEY: I imagine one of them let loose one of the stones?

03:01:09.917 --> 03:01:11.212
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, right over there.

03:01:11.212 --> 03:01:13.298
ASHLEY: It smells like a massive shit.

03:01:13.298 --> 03:01:15.407
(laughter)

03:01:15.407 --> 03:01:18.497
SAM: Welcome to Fuddruckers. Can I take...

03:01:18.497 --> 03:01:20.797
ASHLEY: Oh, yes, could we get actually two?

03:01:20.797 --> 03:01:22.072
Do you want another one?

03:01:22.072 --> 03:01:23.917
TALIESIN: Oh no, one's my limit.

03:01:23.917 --> 03:01:26.908
But I'll have like a water or something like that.

03:01:26.908 --> 03:01:29.116
ASHLEY: Yeah, water.

03:01:29.116 --> 03:01:30.449
TALIESIN: That's going to go right to my head anyway.

03:01:30.449 --> 03:01:31.474
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:01:32.857 --> 03:01:35.490
LAURA: As I dance with Beau:

03:01:35.490 --> 03:01:37.957
Did you hear what Yasha said, Beau?

03:01:37.957 --> 03:01:38.927
MARISHA: Wait, wait, which part?

03:01:38.927 --> 03:01:41.652
LAURA: When we were at the chapel, she said...

03:01:41.652 --> 03:01:42.927
Um... she said...

03:01:42.927 --> 03:01:44.337
(laughter)

03:01:44.337 --> 03:01:45.667
LAURA: I don't know.

03:01:45.667 --> 03:01:46.500
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:49.697
LAURA: She said, "I'm so glad I didn't kill you."

03:01:49.697 --> 03:01:51.294
MARISHA: Yeah, and did you hear what I told her back?

03:01:51.294 --> 03:01:52.907
LAURA: "I'm glad I didn't kill you either."

03:01:52.907 --> 03:01:53.802
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:01:53.802 --> 03:01:55.307
LAURA: That was like the most romantic thing, I think.

03:01:55.307 --> 03:01:56.957
MARISHA: I know, right?

03:01:56.957 --> 03:01:58.577
Do you think she's into me?

03:01:58.577 --> 03:02:00.137
LAURA: I think she's so into you.

03:02:00.137 --> 03:02:02.217
So I'm going to assume from you asking

03:02:02.217 --> 03:02:03.827
that you have not kissed her yet.

03:02:03.827 --> 03:02:06.277
MARISHA: No, no, I feel like it's, like,

03:02:06.277 --> 03:02:07.507
ball's in her court, you know,

03:02:07.507 --> 03:02:10.181
because she's the one with the dead wife.

03:02:10.181 --> 03:02:11.844
LAURA: That makes sense.

03:02:11.844 --> 03:02:12.677
That makes sense.

03:02:12.677 --> 03:02:14.787
But you know, here's the thing.

03:02:14.787 --> 03:02:16.737
You have to put yourself in the place

03:02:16.737 --> 03:02:19.857
that gives her the moment to make the move.

03:02:19.857 --> 03:02:21.257
You know what I mean?

03:02:22.306 --> 03:02:25.309
MARISHA: Oh, Jester, you know I'm afraid of my future.

03:02:25.309 --> 03:02:27.697
LAURA: (laughs)

03:02:27.697 --> 03:02:28.530
MARISHA: Okay.

03:02:28.530 --> 03:02:30.947
What about you, where'd the, uh, unicorn come from?

03:02:30.947 --> 03:02:32.017
LAURA: Fjord gave it to me.

03:02:32.017 --> 03:02:34.025
MARISHA: I know, I saw him buy it!

03:02:34.025 --> 03:02:34.858
LAURA: I didn't see it!

03:02:34.858 --> 03:02:37.107
MARISHA: It was so cute, you were like,

03:02:37.107 --> 03:02:39.474
super distracted, like passing out oops-stones.

03:02:39.474 --> 03:02:40.499
LAURA: I mean, I was!

03:02:40.499 --> 03:02:43.348
MARISHA: I know, and then he, like-- I watched him do it.

03:02:43.348 --> 03:02:44.777
LAURA: My arms are getting so tired.

03:02:44.777 --> 03:02:45.610
MARISHA: Yeah, mine, too.

03:02:45.610 --> 03:02:47.109
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:02:47.109 --> 03:02:47.967
SAM: (laughs)

03:02:47.967 --> 03:02:49.317
Waltzing sucks.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:02:49.317 --> 03:02:50.150
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:51.577
MATT: Smells real bad in here, guys.

03:02:51.577 --> 03:02:54.273
LAURA: It smells real bad, but it will go away so soon.

03:02:54.273 --> 03:02:56.130
But yeah, sorry about the smell.

03:02:56.130 --> 03:02:57.757
MARISHA: Let's-- we'll get to this corner.

03:02:57.757 --> 03:02:58.590
LAURA: Okay.

03:02:58.590 --> 03:02:59.897
TRAVIS: How long does an oops-stone last?

03:02:59.897 --> 03:03:00.730
LAURA: 10 minutes.

03:03:00.730 --> 03:03:02.907
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
MATT: Yeah.

03:03:02.907 --> 03:03:05.149
TRAVIS: Literally took a shit under a table.

03:03:05.149 --> 03:03:08.581
(laughter)

03:03:08.581 --> 03:03:10.957
MATT: If the stone is moved, it goes with it.

03:03:10.957 --> 03:03:14.087
But it's one-use only, so it becomes inert after that.

03:03:14.087 --> 03:03:15.667
TRAVIS: Thank god.

03:03:15.667 --> 03:03:18.587
TALIESIN: This has got to be a lot for you.

03:03:18.587 --> 03:03:22.635
ASHLEY: I mean, it's fine.

03:03:22.635 --> 03:03:25.844
(laughter)

03:03:26.707 --> 03:03:28.466
How are you doing, Caduceus?

03:03:28.466 --> 03:03:29.432
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:03:30.977 --> 03:03:34.197
Actually, I'm having a-- oh, I'm having a pretty good time,

03:03:34.197 --> 03:03:35.399
all things considered.

03:03:35.399 --> 03:03:38.867
ASHLEY: Yes, it's a wave situation.

03:03:38.867 --> 03:03:41.059
So it'll go away and the it comes--

03:03:41.059 --> 03:03:43.297
TALIESIN: You can't get used to
it, because it keeps changing.

03:03:43.297 --> 03:03:47.122
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think it's burning the hair in my nostrils.

03:03:47.998 --> 03:03:50.273
(laughter)

03:03:50.273 --> 03:03:51.681
TALIESIN: Can taste it at the back of my throat.

03:03:51.681 --> 03:03:53.777
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel a little bit of the taste.

03:03:53.777 --> 03:03:55.244
It's kind of like...

03:03:57.157 --> 03:03:58.677
TALIESIN: Feeling like-- I was thinking about seeing

03:03:58.677 --> 03:04:00.347
if there's patio seating.

03:04:00.347 --> 03:04:02.094
ASHLEY: Yeah, should we go to the patio?

03:04:02.094 --> 03:04:03.917
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go see if there's a patio.

03:04:03.917 --> 03:04:05.587
TALIESIN: Grab our drinks.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:04:05.587 --> 03:04:06.420
(laughter)

03:04:06.420 --> 03:04:08.767
TRAVIS: Those drinks are probably ruined.

03:04:08.767 --> 03:04:11.009
TALIESIN: Thaumaturgy to open all the doors and windows.

03:04:11.009 --> 03:04:12.942
LAURA: Oh, smart.
MATT: (banging sounds)

03:04:14.607 --> 03:04:16.697
No one bats an eye.

03:04:16.697 --> 03:04:20.077
In this vicinity as well, there are numerous practitioners

03:04:20.077 --> 03:04:21.457
of all manner of magic.

03:04:21.457 --> 03:04:25.197
So Thaumaturgy is a simple, common trick.

03:04:25.197 --> 03:04:26.830
TALIESIN: Oh, how are you doing?

03:04:29.367 --> 03:04:31.817
ASHLEY: I'm doing well.

03:04:31.817 --> 03:04:35.148
I'm feeling a lot better.

03:04:36.277 --> 03:04:39.429
TALIESIN: Starting to think about your future?

03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:42.487
ASHLEY: I mean, yes.

03:04:42.487 --> 03:04:44.063
I guess.

03:04:45.707 --> 03:04:48.975
You know, thinking about what Nott said of,

03:04:48.975 --> 03:04:50.567
you know, do you know what your purpose is?

03:04:50.567 --> 03:04:54.447
And I mean, do you ever know?

03:04:54.447 --> 03:04:55.455
TALIESIN: Well.

03:04:56.781 --> 03:04:59.520
We can make our best guess, but you know,

03:05:01.047 --> 03:05:02.807
everybody's haunted by who they were

03:05:02.807 --> 03:05:04.357
and who they thought they'd be.

03:05:05.287 --> 03:05:07.487
But if you can just be right here right now,

03:05:08.367 --> 03:05:11.457
there's options open to you.

03:05:11.457 --> 03:05:14.049
Don't have to think about what came before.

03:05:15.897 --> 03:05:18.157
ASHLEY: That's a great thought.

03:05:18.157 --> 03:05:19.387
I'm working on it.

03:05:19.387 --> 03:05:22.517
TALIESIN: Harder in practice than just to say it, but yeah.

03:05:22.517 --> 03:05:23.887
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:05:23.887 --> 03:05:25.662
It is nice to

03:05:28.337 --> 03:05:30.912
see everyone, and see everyone dancing

03:05:30.912 --> 03:05:32.290
and having a good time.

03:05:34.297 --> 03:05:35.947
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm not a dancer, really.

03:05:35.947 --> 03:05:37.757
Not this kind of dancing.

03:05:37.757 --> 03:05:39.737
ASHLEY: What kind of dancing?

03:05:39.737 --> 03:05:43.603
TALIESIN: Oh, big ridiculous bonfire dancing.

03:05:43.603 --> 03:05:47.327
TALIESIN: Oh, big ridiculous bonfire dancing.

03:05:47.327 --> 03:05:49.457
This seems awkward to me.

03:05:49.457 --> 03:05:51.177
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't really know how to do

03:05:51.177 --> 03:05:53.507
the type of dancing they're doing.

03:05:53.507 --> 03:05:56.123
I understand bonfire dancing.

03:05:56.123 --> 03:05:58.205
I quite like dancing.

03:05:58.205 --> 03:05:59.717
TALIESIN: I thought you might be the type.

03:05:59.717 --> 03:06:02.063
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is a little stiff for me.

03:06:03.887 --> 03:06:06.677
TALIESIN: It was great to see you fly, too.

03:06:06.677 --> 03:06:08.521
ASHLEY: That was a thing, huh?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:06:08.521 --> 03:06:10.107
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:06:10.107 --> 03:06:11.320
I had a dream.

03:06:12.217 --> 03:06:15.175
I guess it was a...

03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:18.666
a vision, the night before.

03:06:19.567 --> 03:06:23.508
And I thought...

03:06:25.658 --> 03:06:30.658
in the vision, my wings came out.

03:06:31.037 --> 03:06:35.597
So I thought maybe it would be real,

03:06:35.597 --> 03:06:39.637
and it was, so I don't know why that happened.

03:06:39.637 --> 03:06:41.904
TALIESIN: Well, your chains are broken now.

03:06:44.377 --> 03:06:45.387
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:06:45.387 --> 03:06:49.257
TALIESIN: So now, I guess, what's holding you back?

03:06:54.397 --> 03:06:56.338
ASHLEY: I guess nothing.
TALIESIN: Hmm.

03:06:58.197 --> 03:07:01.475
I think a lot about-- I've been to a lot of funerals.

03:07:02.387 --> 03:07:05.146
I mean a lot.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:07:05.146 --> 03:07:06.617
TALIESIN: You know what the most common thing

03:07:06.617 --> 03:07:08.684
that someone says at a funeral is?

03:07:10.829 --> 03:07:12.257
ASHLEY: "I'm sad?"

03:07:12.257 --> 03:07:13.822
I don't know.

03:07:13.822 --> 03:07:15.987
TALIESIN: "I thought I had more time."

03:07:17.529 --> 03:07:18.495
ASHLEY: Mmm.

03:07:18.495 --> 03:07:20.633
TALIESIN: Every time, at least two.

03:07:21.957 --> 03:07:25.429
So, with that in mind, I don't know,

03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:28.047
think about what's holding you back still.

03:07:28.047 --> 03:07:30.322
Those chains are definitely gone.

03:07:35.227 --> 03:07:36.518
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:07:37.647 --> 03:07:39.577
TALIESIN: Man, those the wings, that's cool.

03:07:39.577 --> 03:07:40.893
MATT: Caduceus.

03:07:42.027 --> 03:07:47.000
Maybe it's just been the chaos the past week or two,

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:47.833
Maybe it's just been the chaos the past week or two,

03:07:48.737 --> 03:07:51.687
but having this moment with the Yasha, the proximity,

03:07:51.687 --> 03:07:56.377
and just really perceiving who she is

03:07:56.377 --> 03:07:59.367
as a person in this moment, one thing you do catch,

03:07:59.367 --> 03:08:04.367
which is curious, is at the roots of her hair,

03:08:04.867 --> 03:08:06.683
you see a lighter color.

03:08:15.067 --> 03:08:16.498
TALIESIN: Do dye your hair?

03:08:19.177 --> 03:08:20.010
ASHLEY: No.

03:08:21.277 --> 03:08:22.110
TALIESIN: Really?

03:08:23.063 --> 03:08:25.395
ASHLEY: Y-y-yeah.

03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:28.877
TALIESIN: When was the last time you looked in the mirror?

03:08:34.977 --> 03:08:37.827
ASHLEY: I don't know, I guess it's been a little while.

03:08:37.827 --> 03:08:42.537
TALIESIN: Let me give you one.
And I'm going to change into Yasha.

03:08:42.537 --> 03:08:43.520
MATT: Okay.

03:08:47.421 --> 03:08:49.457
ASHLEY: (laughs)

03:08:49.457 --> 03:08:50.482
Wow.

03:08:51.487 --> 03:08:52.320
Oh!

03:08:53.467 --> 03:08:54.800
Oh!
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:08:57.097 --> 03:09:00.118
ASHLEY: It's like how my hair used to be.

03:09:01.357 --> 03:09:05.187
TALIESIN: So this is new, or old now, but new at one point?

03:09:05.187 --> 03:09:06.328
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:09:08.957 --> 03:09:10.482
TALIESIN: Well, that is interesting.

03:09:11.747 --> 03:09:12.580
Back.

03:09:13.947 --> 03:09:15.772
ASHLEY: I don't know what's happening.

03:09:16.957 --> 03:09:18.590
TALIESIN: I think you're getting better.

03:09:20.867 --> 03:09:22.049
ASHLEY: What does that mean?

03:09:22.049 --> 03:09:23.310
TALIESIN: I don't know.

03:09:29.092 --> 03:09:30.975
ASHLEY: Okay. So...

03:09:33.258 --> 03:09:35.841
I guess I'll just keep doing what I'm doing, then.

03:09:37.217 --> 03:09:38.767
TALIESIN: I think you should keep moving forward.

03:09:38.767 --> 03:09:40.667
I don't necessarily know if what you're doing

03:09:40.667 --> 03:09:42.117
is always moving forward.

03:09:42.117 --> 03:09:43.517
Sometimes it's moving backwards,

03:09:43.517 --> 03:09:44.967
sometimes it's moving sideways,

03:09:44.967 --> 03:09:48.375
but I would recommend

03:09:49.417 --> 03:09:50.575
don't think that you have

03:09:50.575 --> 03:09:53.487
more time necessarily than you might have.

03:09:56.057 --> 03:10:00.773
Patience is fine, but it can

03:10:00.773 --> 03:10:02.523
curdle into apathy.

03:10:06.067 --> 03:10:07.142
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:10:08.827 --> 03:10:11.540
TALIESIN: Better call home, actually,
now that I think about it.

03:10:13.997 --> 03:10:15.612
Gotta go home sometime.

03:10:17.037 --> 03:10:17.927
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:10:17.927 --> 03:10:19.897
TALIESIN: I don't wanna.

03:10:19.897 --> 03:10:23.035
I mean, I want to, but I don't want to yet.

03:10:24.787 --> 03:10:26.727
ASHLEY: How are you doing with all that?

03:10:30.097 --> 03:10:31.512
TALIESIN: It's complicated.

03:10:32.727 --> 03:10:37.727
I miss it, but I'm afraid sometimes I'd miss this more.

03:10:39.467 --> 03:10:40.542
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:10:41.647 --> 03:10:43.867
TALIESIN: It's hard to pick.

03:10:43.867 --> 03:10:45.797
I think I might feel different once I feel like

03:10:45.797 --> 03:10:49.255
everyone's safe,

03:10:49.255 --> 03:10:52.213
or at least heading in the direction they need to be.

03:10:53.917 --> 03:10:57.547
ASHLEY: I have a feeling we're not
going to be safe for a while.

03:10:57.547 --> 03:10:59.292
TALIESIN: Not for a while.

03:10:59.292 --> 03:11:02.217
ASHLEY: So you might be stuck with us a little bit longer.

03:11:03.237 --> 03:11:05.197
TALIESIN: That's a fine future.

03:11:05.197 --> 03:11:06.413
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:11:07.997 --> 03:11:10.097
TALIESIN: I will eventually be home, though.

03:11:10.097 --> 03:11:11.672
And it will be wonderful.

03:11:13.697 --> 03:11:15.128
ASHLEY: I think so, too.

03:11:17.495 --> 03:11:19.748
And I think you're pretty great, Caduceus.

03:11:19.748 --> 03:11:22.318
TALIESIN: Thank you. I think you're pretty great, too.

03:11:23.254 --> 03:11:24.703
ASHLEY: Thank you.

03:11:27.757 --> 03:11:28.955
TALIESIN: I don't want to go back in there.

03:11:28.955 --> 03:11:30.780
It smells terrible.

03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:33.591
ASHLEY: It's still coming out of the windows and the door.
TALIESIN: It's just leaking.

03:11:33.591 --> 03:11:34.607
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:11:34.607 --> 03:11:37.384
It's just like a leaky butt.

03:11:37.384 --> 03:11:38.400
LAURA: We bust out.

03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:39.997
We come out of the--

03:11:39.997 --> 03:11:40.947
It's too much!

03:11:40.947 --> 03:11:43.247
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: I'm sorry I did it. It's too much!

03:11:43.247 --> 03:11:46.127
ASHLEY: But you know, we know it works.

03:11:46.127 --> 03:11:47.758
That was just one stone!

03:11:47.758 --> 03:11:49.945
MARISHA: I think the busboy barfed. (laughs)

03:11:49.945 --> 03:11:53.807
(laughter)

03:11:53.807 --> 03:11:55.334
MARISHA: Well, that was fun.

03:11:55.334 --> 03:11:56.400
LAURA: Caleb?
LIAM: Thank you.

03:11:56.400 --> 03:11:59.777
Yeah, let's go see Lady DeRogna.

03:11:59.777 --> 03:12:00.777
MATT: All right.

03:12:00.777 --> 03:12:02.517
LIAM: And Caleb will hang at the door

03:12:02.517 --> 03:12:04.847
and look back in and just remember

03:12:04.847 --> 03:12:07.677
for 10 seconds, and then go.

03:12:07.677 --> 03:12:08.510
MATT: You got it.

03:12:09.977 --> 03:12:11.256
MATT: Eventually, following Caleb.

03:12:11.256 --> 03:12:16.047
You're not that far as the Candles, in a semicircle pattern,

03:12:16.047 --> 03:12:18.287
these eight towers that represent members

03:12:18.287 --> 03:12:22.977
of the Cerberus Assembly, encircle the Castle Terrace.

03:12:22.977 --> 03:12:25.337
And where you are is not

03:12:25.337 --> 03:12:28.983
but a 10-minute walk before you come upon

03:12:28.983 --> 03:12:33.180
what's known colloquially as the Two-Facet Tower.

03:12:34.087 --> 03:12:37.417
It's a tall, deep green-gray tower

03:12:37.417 --> 03:12:39.710
that forks into two smaller towers

03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:41.077
of differing heights,

03:12:41.077 --> 03:12:44.700
a variation like that.

03:12:46.897 --> 03:12:49.130
It is immense

03:12:49.130 --> 03:12:52.521
and elegant in its simplicity.

03:12:52.521 --> 03:12:54.047
A number these towers, you see in the distance.

03:12:54.047 --> 03:12:58.669
Some have various levels of gaudy detail and decor,

03:13:00.661 --> 03:13:03.745
massive lush courtyards and surrounding

03:13:06.686 --> 03:13:10.857
constructs in worshiping presence to whoever

03:13:10.857 --> 03:13:14.157
the person who's claimed it it may be.

03:13:14.157 --> 03:13:16.940
This is on the more simple scale.

03:13:18.377 --> 03:13:21.297
As you step to the front door,

03:13:21.297 --> 03:13:26.155
it is a large, 10-foot by six-foot,

03:13:26.155 --> 03:13:27.957
deep gray wood door.

03:13:27.957 --> 03:13:30.337
The slats are smooth and polished

03:13:30.337 --> 03:13:32.337
and are affixed to each other with

03:13:32.337 --> 03:13:35.407
a very, very dark bronze

03:13:35.407 --> 03:13:38.937
or brass-type metal bands in three different places.

03:13:38.937 --> 03:13:41.382
There is a heavy knocker attached

03:13:41.382 --> 03:13:43.597
to the front made of the same metal material.

03:13:43.597 --> 03:13:45.447
And you can see the ring

03:13:45.447 --> 03:13:49.240
seems to be inside the mouth of a griffon of some kind.

03:13:50.967 --> 03:13:52.033
LAURA: We knock?

03:13:53.515 --> 03:13:57.216
LIAM: (knocking)

03:13:57.216 --> 03:14:01.258
MATT: The door (clicks, creaking)

03:14:01.258 --> 03:14:03.517
opens up slightly and leads into the interior.

03:14:03.517 --> 03:14:05.580
There's nobody to greet you,

03:14:06.897 --> 03:14:08.437
but as you do look inside,

03:14:08.437 --> 03:14:11.467
your eyes adjust a bit to the low-lit interior.

03:14:11.467 --> 03:14:15.037
It is as elegant and simple inside as you would imagine

03:14:15.037 --> 03:14:17.423
it would be, in comparison to the outside.

03:14:17.423 --> 03:14:19.547
You are now standing in the middle of a gorgeous

03:14:19.547 --> 03:14:22.965
foyer chamber at the base of this tower.

03:14:22.965 --> 03:14:27.057
A lot of dark wood, gold leaf surround the marble floors.

03:14:27.057 --> 03:14:28.597
And you can see there's a staircase on

03:14:28.597 --> 03:14:30.377
the back that curves upward with a

03:14:30.377 --> 03:14:33.982
very intricately carved banister that rides along it

03:14:33.982 --> 03:14:38.657
that looks almost like a curving snake

03:14:38.657 --> 03:14:40.867
of some kind that just makes its way up

03:14:40.867 --> 03:14:43.152
and out of view as it heads upward.

03:14:43.152 --> 03:14:45.757
You can see a central rug over the marble flooring

03:14:45.757 --> 03:14:48.437
that has beautiful inlaid pattern designs

03:14:48.437 --> 03:14:49.997
that match the circular shape of it.

03:14:49.997 --> 03:14:53.127
There are two dark gray,

03:14:53.127 --> 03:14:55.877
almost black velvet seated benches

03:14:55.877 --> 03:15:00.152
that face each other in this atrium chamber, if you will.

03:15:01.557 --> 03:15:04.403
The only way you see is up, but as you step in, the door--

03:15:04.403 --> 03:15:05.236
(thudding)

03:15:05.236 --> 03:15:09.637
It closes behind you. You all jump ever so slightly.

03:15:09.637 --> 03:15:11.257
It's comfortable in here.

03:15:11.257 --> 03:15:14.347
The temperature is a little warmer

03:15:14.347 --> 03:15:17.142
than the colder day of Rexxentrum.

03:15:19.427 --> 03:15:21.307
There's a brief quiet moment as you all

03:15:21.307 --> 03:15:23.077
are looking at each other

03:15:23.077 --> 03:15:25.652
and taking in the surroundings before a

03:15:25.652 --> 03:15:28.767
sourceless voice echoes around the air

03:15:29.757 --> 03:15:31.290
above and around you.

03:15:33.242 --> 03:15:36.287
(as Vess) "Welcome. I'm so glad you could make it

03:15:36.287 --> 03:15:39.827
"and with relatively good time.

03:15:39.827 --> 03:15:43.744
"Please, join me upstairs for some tea and conversation."

03:15:48.680 --> 03:15:50.577
LIAM: Caleb will start walking up.

03:15:50.577 --> 03:15:51.446
MATT: Okay.

03:15:51.446 --> 03:15:53.028
LIAM: (whispering) Wizard tower!
TRAVIS: I'll also go.

03:15:53.028 --> 03:15:55.750
LAURA: I hope she's got cookies to go with the tea.

03:15:56.927 --> 03:16:01.292
TRAVIS: I'll casually activate See Invisibility

03:16:01.292 --> 03:16:03.417
just as we're inside, for an hour.

03:16:03.417 --> 03:16:04.387
MATT: You've got it.

03:16:04.387 --> 03:16:05.220
Okay.

03:16:06.157 --> 03:16:09.147
As you invoke See Invisibility,

03:16:09.147 --> 03:16:10.947
there's a brief moment of shock

03:16:10.947 --> 03:16:13.467
as you see four invisible figures

03:16:13.467 --> 03:16:16.757
that just sit in the sides of the room, unmoving.

03:16:16.757 --> 03:16:20.130
Humanoid, but still shapeless and translucent.

03:16:21.037 --> 03:16:24.097
You've had some experience with Unseen Servants before,

03:16:24.097 --> 03:16:25.417
but there are four of them that are just

03:16:25.417 --> 03:16:28.060
standing at the ready for any command.

03:16:29.757 --> 03:16:31.607
Not reacting to your presence at all.

03:16:32.577 --> 03:16:33.830
TRAVIS: So far so good.

03:16:36.187 --> 03:16:39.420
MATT: As you ascend the heavy staircase

03:16:39.420 --> 03:16:41.797
following the curvature,

03:16:41.797 --> 03:16:45.657
the stair curvature seems to be wider

03:16:45.657 --> 03:16:49.827
than your initial casing of the width of the tower.

03:16:49.827 --> 03:16:51.787
And what you thought would be a shorter jaunt

03:16:51.787 --> 03:16:54.167
to the next floor seems to go a little longer

03:16:54.167 --> 03:16:55.057
than you anticipated.

03:16:55.057 --> 03:16:57.147
By the time it comes around,

03:16:57.147 --> 03:16:59.655
you are now met with this

03:16:59.655 --> 03:17:03.207
beautiful lounge-like space.

03:17:03.207 --> 03:17:08.207
The floor has this thick, carpeted,

03:17:08.647 --> 03:17:11.547
deep-set red coloration to it.

03:17:11.547 --> 03:17:14.587
There is a large white marble fireplace

03:17:14.587 --> 03:17:17.197
across the way where you see a roaring fire burns

03:17:17.197 --> 03:17:18.987
and crackles on the inside.

03:17:18.987 --> 03:17:21.676
There is a beautiful portrait across it,

03:17:21.676 --> 03:17:24.840
about eight to 10 feet wide by five feet tall

03:17:24.840 --> 03:17:27.940
that looks to show, curiously enough,

03:17:27.940 --> 03:17:30.787
the broken landscape of Xhorhas.

03:17:31.627 --> 03:17:35.847
You can see a number of pillars that carry statues

03:17:35.847 --> 03:17:37.817
and sculptures of odd creatures

03:17:37.817 --> 03:17:41.407
and beasts, heads and busts.

03:17:41.407 --> 03:17:44.027
They're beautifully detailed

03:17:44.027 --> 03:17:47.210
and all terrifying to some degree.

03:17:48.497 --> 03:17:52.447
You recognize one of them to be similar

03:17:52.447 --> 03:17:56.257
to that creature that you saw fleeing that tyrannosaurus,

03:17:56.257 --> 03:17:59.452
that gray-blue and white-haired creature,

03:17:59.452 --> 03:18:02.227
long jaw. It has somewhat human characteristics,

03:18:02.227 --> 03:18:03.337
but everything is elongated

03:18:03.337 --> 03:18:05.837
and perverted in this monstrous way.

03:18:05.837 --> 03:18:06.897
Another one you can see,

03:18:06.897 --> 03:18:10.317
it looks to have a smooth head

03:18:10.317 --> 03:18:12.127
with these deep-set eyes,

03:18:12.127 --> 03:18:13.917
a featureless, sloped forehead

03:18:13.917 --> 03:18:16.645
and the mouth goes into these long tendrils

03:18:16.645 --> 03:18:19.460
that end about chest of its bust.

03:18:21.505 --> 03:18:23.805
There are other creatures you do not recognize,

03:18:23.805 --> 03:18:25.767
and there are sculptures in the walls as well.

03:18:25.767 --> 03:18:28.457
Imagine if you see a trophy head room

03:18:28.457 --> 03:18:30.347
where a hunter keeps their trophies,

03:18:30.347 --> 03:18:32.447
but these are all just stone reliefs

03:18:32.447 --> 03:18:36.197
and sculptures and depictions of various monstrosities

03:18:36.197 --> 03:18:37.500
around Exandaria.

03:18:37.500 --> 03:18:40.016
But here they sit like art

03:18:40.016 --> 03:18:41.549
in the space around.

03:18:44.647 --> 03:18:49.417
It's off-putting, intentional or not.

03:18:49.417 --> 03:18:52.867
But nevertheless, this is the chamber you've walked into.

03:18:52.867 --> 03:18:55.327
There are a number of chairs

03:18:55.327 --> 03:18:58.847
arranged in a sort of semicircle pattern,

03:18:58.847 --> 03:19:03.845
a beautiful polished cherry wood in color.

03:19:03.845 --> 03:19:06.307
a beautiful polished cherry wood in color.

03:19:06.307 --> 03:19:09.607
Antique-looking chairs, but very well kept,

03:19:09.607 --> 03:19:11.377
and as you begin to step towards them,

03:19:11.377 --> 03:19:13.707
they all at once uniformly

03:19:13.707 --> 03:19:16.397
scoot back to give space for you to step towards them.

03:19:16.397 --> 03:19:18.327
You look at the chairs

03:19:18.327 --> 03:19:19.817
and as you look up, where previously

03:19:19.817 --> 03:19:22.147
you were taking in the vicinity,

03:19:22.147 --> 03:19:23.547
but you almost feel like you--

03:19:23.547 --> 03:19:25.557
how did you not realize she was there the entire time?

03:19:25.557 --> 03:19:27.117
Was she there the entire time?

03:19:27.117 --> 03:19:28.437
You see, sitting in a similar chair

03:19:28.437 --> 03:19:30.345
across the way from a table

03:19:30.345 --> 03:19:33.065
that has an arrangement of small treats

03:19:33.065 --> 03:19:34.867
and cookies and crumpets and scones

03:19:34.867 --> 03:19:38.217
and a very unique-looking

03:19:38.217 --> 03:19:40.727
tea kettle or tea pot of some kind,

03:19:40.727 --> 03:19:44.169
along with arranged saucers and cups,

03:19:44.169 --> 03:19:48.787
you see the familiar face of Lady Vess DeRogna

03:19:48.787 --> 03:19:51.067
sitting in a simple, elegant green robe

03:19:51.067 --> 03:19:53.897
to match the exterior of the tower.

03:19:53.897 --> 03:19:55.607
Her shortish brown hair

03:19:55.607 --> 03:19:58.210
that curls ever so slightly at the tips.

03:19:59.247 --> 03:20:02.787
Her half-elven features, in that

03:20:02.787 --> 03:20:06.447
just coasting into the middle age of a half-elf look.

03:20:08.057 --> 03:20:09.827
Very striking.

03:20:09.827 --> 03:20:13.014
She, at first, has a hard

03:20:14.037 --> 03:20:17.217
concentrating look as she takes a sip of her tea

03:20:17.217 --> 03:20:18.050
and then sits down

03:20:18.050 --> 03:20:19.717
and then it softens as you approach.

03:20:20.597 --> 03:20:25.013
"Please have a seat, Mighty Nein."

03:20:27.067 --> 03:20:28.737
LAURA: I'm going to take the seat closest

03:20:28.737 --> 03:20:31.786
to the the scones and the cookies.

03:20:36.587 --> 03:20:39.747
MATT: "I'm sorry, does this arrangement bother you?

03:20:39.747 --> 03:20:41.137
"I thought as adventurers

03:20:41.137 --> 03:20:42.610
"it would be more welcoming to see."

03:20:43.937 --> 03:20:45.537
LAURA: Where did you get all of these?

03:20:46.507 --> 03:20:47.487
MATT: "I created it.

03:20:47.487 --> 03:20:49.437
She makes one gesture with her hand

03:20:49.437 --> 03:20:51.147
and you watch all the art pieces shimmer

03:20:51.147 --> 03:20:54.727
and change into just beautiful sculptures of people,

03:20:54.727 --> 03:20:57.207
artistry and poses and such.

03:20:57.207 --> 03:20:58.630
"Is this more to your liking?"

03:21:00.044 --> 03:21:03.207
LIAM: Either way, I would not have been surprised

03:21:03.207 --> 03:21:04.337
if you had collected these.

03:21:04.337 --> 03:21:07.097
I would expect no less from the Archmage of Antiquity.

03:21:08.637 --> 03:21:10.846
LAURA: Can you make it be anything?

03:21:10.846 --> 03:21:13.147
MATT: "Within a certain amount of reason."

03:21:13.147 --> 03:21:15.050
LAURA: Can you make it look like a candyland in here?

03:21:15.050 --> 03:21:17.267
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:21:17.267 --> 03:21:18.183
MATT: "Probably.

03:21:20.357 --> 03:21:21.290
"So."

03:21:21.290 --> 03:21:23.540
(laughter)

03:21:24.447 --> 03:21:27.157
MATT: "Please have some tea, if you'd like.

03:21:27.157 --> 03:21:31.357
"This is made from the paragon mint,

03:21:31.357 --> 03:21:33.797
"from the Fields of Elysium."

03:21:33.797 --> 03:21:36.055
LAURA: Whoa.

03:21:38.767 --> 03:21:42.397
LIAM: One of ours-- Caduceus, here--
is a bit of an aficionado--

03:21:42.397 --> 03:21:44.564
TALIESIN: Quite nice.
LIAM: -- of tea.

03:21:46.786 --> 03:21:48.419
LAURA: (with mouth full) Where are the cookies from?

03:21:48.419 --> 03:21:49.263
MATT: "Hmm?"

03:21:49.263 --> 03:21:51.397
LAURA: Where are the cookies from?

03:21:51.397 --> 03:21:55.147
MATT: "Oh, the cookies were brought from a local baker.

03:21:55.147 --> 03:21:56.877
"I still like to make sure that I support

03:21:56.877 --> 03:21:59.487
"the smaller local businesses."

03:21:59.487 --> 03:22:00.862
SAM: It's nice, wow. Yeah.

03:22:02.377 --> 03:22:03.908
MATT: So those who drink the tea

03:22:03.908 --> 03:22:06.350
get 3d6 temporary hit points.

03:22:07.567 --> 03:22:10.410
It is, as a tea aficionado,

03:22:12.057 --> 03:22:14.007
it has that initial mint flavor,

03:22:14.007 --> 03:22:16.760
and then it becomes less flavor and more experiential.

03:22:18.127 --> 03:22:21.040
The flavor becomes instead like a nice memory.

03:22:22.777 --> 03:22:27.777
Like finding-- it's a nostalgia-like experience, the flavor.

03:22:28.053 --> 03:22:30.647
And thinking, something that was taking,

03:22:30.647 --> 03:22:31.557
that was actually farmed--

03:22:31.557 --> 03:22:33.577
If this is indeed farmed from the Fields of Elysium,

03:22:33.577 --> 03:22:37.415
which is not of this plane, it is a godly plane.

03:22:38.432 --> 03:22:40.249
This is probably the type of experience you would expect

03:22:40.249 --> 03:22:41.517
having that kind of tea.

03:22:41.517 --> 03:22:43.077
LIAM: I rolled really well,

03:22:43.077 --> 03:22:44.984
and I'm still not over a hundred hit points.

03:22:44.984 --> 03:22:47.234
(laughter)

03:22:48.376 --> 03:22:49.209
MATT: All right.

03:22:50.838 --> 03:22:54.087
LIAM: It's nice that we can be exchanging pleasantries

03:22:54.087 --> 03:22:55.260
here at home.

03:22:56.297 --> 03:22:57.357
MATT: "Of course."

03:22:57.357 --> 03:22:58.610
LIAM: Not far out at sea.

03:23:02.087 --> 03:23:05.267
MATT: "You have done quite a bit of service to the Empire.

03:23:06.612 --> 03:23:10.797
"Ludinus speaks highly of your involvement

03:23:10.797 --> 03:23:12.600
"in bringing this peace to a close."

03:23:13.557 --> 03:23:15.298
LIAM: We've been preoccupied with some

03:23:15.298 --> 03:23:16.727
side matters of our own.

03:23:16.727 --> 03:23:20.307
I'm curious, what is the news in the short time

03:23:20.307 --> 03:23:24.107
that has elapsed since this big change?

03:23:24.107 --> 03:23:26.900
MATT: "Well, since the exchange,

03:23:26.900 --> 03:23:30.127
"emissaries have been sent to the front lines.

03:23:30.127 --> 03:23:31.947
"Generals have been returning

03:23:31.947 --> 03:23:33.860
"with their armed forces on both sides.

03:23:35.267 --> 03:23:36.957
"Conflicts have been at a minimum,

03:23:36.957 --> 03:23:38.997
"and there is a plan in place

03:23:38.997 --> 03:23:40.237
"that has been discussed at length

03:23:40.237 --> 03:23:44.777
"between both ours and the Dynasty's individuals

03:23:44.777 --> 03:23:48.860
"to close any sort of

03:23:48.860 --> 03:23:51.037
"boundary conflicts.

03:23:51.037 --> 03:23:53.747
"We stay on our side, they stay on theirs."

03:23:53.747 --> 03:23:55.357
LIAM: You feel the peace will hold?

03:23:55.357 --> 03:23:56.273
MATT: "No.

03:23:57.665 --> 03:24:00.298
"At least not entirely.

03:24:02.417 --> 03:24:04.517
"You look smart enough to know that

03:24:05.837 --> 03:24:10.607
"one peace does not necessarily mean

03:24:10.607 --> 03:24:11.757
"everything is at peace.

03:24:13.457 --> 03:24:15.337
"This war has been going on for far longer

03:24:15.337 --> 03:24:16.637
"than it has been declared."

03:24:18.137 --> 03:24:20.267
LIAM: We have spent a lot of time traveling

03:24:20.267 --> 03:24:24.240
on the other side of the border and the wounds run deep.

03:24:26.157 --> 03:24:26.990
MATT: "Well."

03:24:26.990 --> 03:24:28.437
LAURA: (munching)

03:24:28.437 --> 03:24:30.687
(laughter)

03:24:33.337 --> 03:24:35.117
LIAM: But for now the peace perhaps will hold,

03:24:35.117 --> 03:24:39.867
and both sides can take stock and

03:24:39.867 --> 03:24:43.347
maybe see a better way.

03:24:43.347 --> 03:24:48.057
MATT: "It is-- the step that has been made

03:24:48.057 --> 03:24:51.090
"is a step that will save the most lives.

03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:55.978
"The outward peace means that

03:24:56.911 --> 03:24:58.137
"most innocents will not be

03:24:58.137 --> 03:25:00.235
"sent to their deaths fighting for things

03:25:00.235 --> 03:25:02.640
"they do not necessarily understand or believe in.

03:25:04.297 --> 03:25:05.743
"But conflict is not over."

03:25:07.973 --> 03:25:08.806
LIAM: No.

03:25:11.017 --> 03:25:14.157
Personally, it is something

03:25:14.157 --> 03:25:15.582
that I still very much hope for,

03:25:15.582 --> 03:25:18.207
but we are a pragmatic bunch

03:25:18.207 --> 03:25:21.447
and understand the realities of the world.

03:25:21.447 --> 03:25:22.327
MATT: "So I've heard."

03:25:22.327 --> 03:25:23.777
LIAM: But for now, there is peace.

03:25:28.307 --> 03:25:32.007
We have not yet forgotten your offer to collaborate,

03:25:33.444 --> 03:25:36.877
and have decided

03:25:36.877 --> 03:25:39.624
perhaps we can be of use to the Empire and

03:25:40.465 --> 03:25:43.490
do some good and earn some coin and earn a living.

03:25:46.837 --> 03:25:50.787
You know that my roots are here in Rexxentrum

03:25:50.787 --> 03:25:55.787
and while I am not

03:25:55.945 --> 03:25:57.820
of the cloth, as it were,

03:25:59.567 --> 03:26:01.007
I figure that I and my friends

03:26:01.007 --> 03:26:03.400
could do a bit of freelance work.

03:26:04.387 --> 03:26:05.738
If it still pleases you.

03:26:06.597 --> 03:26:07.660
MATT: "It will, very much.

03:26:09.937 --> 03:26:13.310
"You've done quite a bit of good under Ludinus,

03:26:14.727 --> 03:26:16.417
"and if I'm to have you work with me,

03:26:16.417 --> 03:26:20.723
"I would like to share a truth with you.

03:26:23.274 --> 03:26:24.983
"Do not trust Ludinus."

03:26:27.427 --> 03:26:28.635
LAURA: (huffs)

03:26:31.124 --> 03:26:33.247
Why?
MARISHA: To be fair, I don't think we did.

03:26:33.247 --> 03:26:34.401
MATT: "Good.

03:26:34.401 --> 03:26:36.034
"It is why I have contacted you.

03:26:36.977 --> 03:26:39.600
"Discerning eyes is useful.

"I would ask that whatever business we are doing,

"we keep between us.

03:26:49.467 --> 03:26:51.917
"Outwardly, as I'm sure there will be inquisition,

03:26:53.317 --> 03:26:54.987
"there would be individuals asking.

"Curiosities, perhaps even Ludinus himself.

"You are to be my bodyguards."

03:27:03.057 --> 03:27:04.439
LAURA: Or really?

03:27:04.439 --> 03:27:05.837
MATT: "Well, perhaps really to an extent,

03:27:05.837 --> 03:27:10.837
"but what the world outside of this room would know

03:27:10.897 --> 03:27:13.427
"is that you are to be my bodyguards.

"to keep an individual of such importance also safe.

03:27:31.687 --> 03:27:34.820
"And where I wish to go, there is very little safety."

03:27:35.827 --> 03:27:37.327
MARISHA: And where do you wish to go?

03:27:40.007 --> 03:27:41.857
MATT: "How much do you know of Eiselcross?"

03:27:42.829 --> 03:27:43.971
TRAVIS: Eisel-huh?

03:27:44.879 --> 03:27:46.750
Eiselcross?
MATT: "Eiselcross."

03:27:46.750 --> 03:27:48.501
MARISHA: Eiselcross.

03:27:48.501 --> 03:27:50.027
LAURA: Do we know anything about Eiselcross?

03:27:50.027 --> 03:27:51.239
LIAM: We do know a little bit.

03:27:51.239 --> 03:27:52.722
It's a bit of a graveyard for

03:27:54.941 --> 03:27:57.499
an older civilization.

03:27:57.499 --> 03:27:58.611
MATT: "One of many."

03:27:58.611 --> 03:28:02.161
MARISHA: The name has passed our periphery a few times.

03:28:02.161 --> 03:28:04.588
MATT: "It is in the Biting North,

03:28:04.588 --> 03:28:07.238
"beyond the Greying Wildlands."

03:28:07.238 --> 03:28:09.114
TRAVIS: Oh, it's at the top of this map.

What are your intentions?

03:31:29.117 --> 03:31:33.697
And what do you believe Ludinus' intentions are?

MATT: "Ludinus' intentions are as they've always been:

03:31:42.147 --> 03:31:45.432
"to maintain personal power

MATT: "There's plenty tension between all of us."

03:32:30.597 --> 03:32:32.607

LIAM: -- over Ludinus?

Oh, okay.

03:32:44.923 --> 03:32:48.197
To secure these weapons and

03:32:48.197 --> 03:32:49.747
use them for the might of the Empire

03:32:49.747 --> 03:32:52.430

nature of these weapons first.

MATT: Both of you.

03:33:27.337 --> 03:33:30.257
The Happy Fun Ball, that was pre-Calamity?

03:33:30.257 --> 03:33:32.323
That was from a wizard that was pre-Calamity, right?

03:33:32.323 --> 03:33:33.156
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: I can't remember.

03:33:33.156 --> 03:33:34.632

MARISHA: (whoops)

03:33:48.769 --> 03:33:50.175
MARISHA: She want those weapons?

TRAVIS: 28.

03:33:55.357 --> 03:33:58.677
MATT: Well, she said the weapons are one interest.

03:33:58.677 --> 03:33:59.960
MARISHA: Oh, they're one interest? Okay.

03:33:59.960 --> 03:34:01.627
LIAM: Then said she's a history buff.

03:34:06.957 --> 03:34:10.407

MARISHA: Feels very counterintuitive.

MATT: "There's an element of plausible deniability here

"On the surface, no, it is a frozen, icy plain."

03:35:46.960 --> 03:35:48.897

not dissimilar to the one that you wear.

03:41:01.959 --> 03:41:04.930
MARISHA: Allowak's Sanctuary.

03:41:04.930 --> 03:41:06.094
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a good one.

03:41:06.094 --> 03:41:08.247
LAURA: Can you text a picture of it to us?

03:41:08.247 --> 03:41:10.060
MATT: I will do that to you guys, don't worry.

03:41:10.927 --> 03:41:12.407
MARISHA: We're in an IKEA.

03:41:13.683 --> 03:41:15.537
LIAM: We have a few loose ends to tie up

03:41:15.537 --> 03:41:16.407
before we can go,

03:41:16.407 --> 03:41:19.157
but that can be taken care of rather promptly.

03:41:19.157 --> 03:41:20.567
When do you wish to leave,

03:41:20.567 --> 03:41:22.520
and by what means of travel?

03:41:23.754 --> 03:41:26.851
MATT: "Well, I would like to travel

03:41:26.851 --> 03:41:28.957
"hopefully within the next week,

03:41:28.957 --> 03:41:31.109
"if possible.

03:41:31.109 --> 03:41:34.176
"Means of travel is an interesting conversation.

03:41:35.743 --> 03:41:37.759
"I, myself,"

03:41:37.759 --> 03:41:39.597
and she gives you a look for a moment, Caleb,

03:41:39.597 --> 03:41:44.547
"and perhaps you as well, are less limited

03:41:44.547 --> 03:41:47.262
"than others in our ability to travel.

"The curious element of Aeor's location

03:41:54.837 --> 03:41:57.777
"is its presence has continued to weave

"all sorts of wild, unchecked

"magic oddities across the continent.

03:42:10.207 --> 03:42:15.127
"For instance," and she gestures to the map.

03:42:15.127 --> 03:42:16.530
"it is a frozen place,

03:42:17.517 --> 03:42:20.489
"but Foren specifically is divided by

"a seemingly sourceless river

"of perpetually flowing lava."

LAURA: (gasps)

TRAVIS: Lava!

(cheering)

03:42:32.937 --> 03:42:35.887
MATT: "There are all manner of strange impossibilities

03:42:35.887 --> 03:42:39.097
"across Eiselcross that continue to support

03:42:40.767 --> 03:42:43.150
"the thesis that Aeor resides there.

"And there are some who have used magic to transport

03:42:46.773 --> 03:42:50.971

TRAVIS: Oh.

03:42:51.804 --> 03:42:52.770
MARISHA: Oh boy.
LIAM: That's bad.

03:42:52.770 --> 03:42:54.517
MATT: "I've only had one experience with this

03:42:54.517 --> 03:42:56.637
"and found myself thrust about three miles

03:42:56.637 --> 03:42:59.287
"above the Frozen Depths.

03:42:59.287 --> 03:43:01.357
"Plummeted quite a bit before I caught myself

"and was able to return home.

03:43:03.457 --> 03:43:06.566
"So we will not be transporting there by magical means."

03:43:06.566 --> 03:43:08.081
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

03:43:08.081 --> 03:43:10.367
LAURA: Why didn't you just polymorph immediately

03:43:11.677 --> 03:43:12.777
when you were falling?

03:43:13.787 --> 03:43:15.159
Into like a bird or something.

03:43:15.159 --> 03:43:16.637
SAM: Backseat spellcaster?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:43:16.637 --> 03:43:18.797
MATT: "Because it's much easier for me to just

03:43:18.797 --> 03:43:21.786
"float for a bit and then return

03:43:21.786 --> 03:43:24.707
"by more instantaneous means."

03:43:24.707 --> 03:43:27.026
LAURA: So you can be falling and then like,

03:43:27.026 --> 03:43:29.527
(poof) and you can transport back to here?

03:43:29.527 --> 03:43:32.327
MATT: "Well, I can glide myself down to a body of land

03:43:32.327 --> 03:43:34.257
"and then send myself back."

03:43:34.257 --> 03:43:37.265
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay. I can do that, too.

03:43:37.265 --> 03:43:39.460
MATT: "Good. That may come in handy for you.

"We will-- the intent is to travel

ASHLEY: Yes!

TRAVIS: Like we just got the itinerary

03:44:31.067 --> 03:44:32.465
for a dope fucking cruise.

03:44:32.465 --> 03:44:34.068
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Yeah!

03:44:34.068 --> 03:44:36.142
MARISHA: Salmon fishing at 9:00am.

03:44:36.142 --> 03:44:38.647
LIAM: We will whisk away to Palebank Village

03:44:38.647 --> 03:44:42.187

TRAVIS: (laughs)

LAURA: Fjord, you could buy lots of fire rings for that.

03:45:24.951 --> 03:45:26.417
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, think of how many fire rings

03:45:26.417 --> 03:45:28.687
you could purchase with that.

MARISHA: And your only

03:46:07.879 --> 03:46:12.437

03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:15.602
MATT: "Primarily, yes."

03:46:17.987 --> 03:46:19.630

TRAVIS: I'm in.

MARISHA: All right.

LIAM: It makes sense.

TALIESIN: We have some loose ends to tie up.

We have one more member to talk to,

03:47:08.487 --> 03:47:10.430

I have news to tell you.

03:48:20.665 --> 03:48:22.323
They got chains.

You all look up,

you all look at Jester during this

03:49:34.967 --> 03:49:36.806
and you look back to the chair and the chair's empty.

SAM: As each candy was going into her bag,

03:49:51.697 --> 03:49:54.301
Sprinkle was just like, "I want it."

03:49:54.301 --> 03:49:55.468
TALIESIN: What I got?

LIAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: Okay.

03:50:01.469 --> 03:50:02.907
TRAVIS: I walk over to one of the Unseen Servants

03:50:02.907 --> 03:50:03.777
as we walk out.

03:50:03.777 --> 03:50:04.660

03:50:10.527 --> 03:50:13.707
You exit the tower. The door closes behind you,

03:50:13.707 --> 03:50:16.127
and now you stand among, on the street,

03:50:16.127 --> 03:50:17.560
here in the Candles,

03:50:19.167 --> 03:50:22.440
taking in the discussion you just had.

03:50:24.019 --> 03:50:26.830
TRAVIS: We're going to need warmer clothes.

03:50:27.977 --> 03:50:32.003
Like, much warmer than even when we were in Xhorhas.

03:50:32.003 --> 03:50:34.284
LAURA: I like the cold.

03:50:34.284 --> 03:50:36.168
But yeah, probably.

03:50:37.897 --> 03:50:38.730
MARISHA: Wow.

03:50:41.273 --> 03:50:42.106
LIAM: Well.

03:50:43.862 --> 03:50:46.312
Anyone feel like going to Nicodranas for dinner?

03:50:48.376 --> 03:50:50.107
MARISHA: Yeah, sounds great.

03:50:50.107 --> 03:50:51.879
Could go for some ceviche.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:50:51.879 --> 03:50:53.197
SAM: (laughs)

03:50:53.197 --> 03:50:54.430
TALIESIN: I was just thinking the same thing.

03:50:56.697 --> 03:50:59.757
MATT: A young student in the

03:50:59.757 --> 03:51:03.057
robes of the Soltryce Academy,

03:51:03.057 --> 03:51:04.967
from a distance, you can hear

03:51:04.967 --> 03:51:07.998
the footsteps approach as this young,

03:51:07.998 --> 03:51:11.907
16, 17-year-old boy with mousy brown hair,

03:51:11.907 --> 03:51:13.560
cut short, approaches.

03:51:14.507 --> 03:51:17.360
"Ah, very sorry to bother you.

03:51:20.007 --> 03:51:21.517
"Are you Bren?"

03:51:21.517 --> 03:51:22.417
SAM and LAURA: (gasp)

03:51:22.417 --> 03:51:24.435
MARISHA: Oh shit.

03:51:25.825 --> 03:51:26.771
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:51:29.397 --> 03:51:30.230
MATT: "Here,"

03:51:30.230 --> 03:51:33.341
and hands a letter, a wax-sealed letter to you.

03:51:34.271 --> 03:51:36.737
"(sighs)," and then just heads off.

03:51:36.737 --> 03:51:38.839
LIAM: <i>Tschuss</i>.

03:51:38.839 --> 03:51:40.367
LAURA: Who is it? What's it from?

03:51:40.367 --> 03:51:42.767
MATT: Check the back of your binder.

03:51:42.767 --> 03:51:45.004
SAM: Did you slip something in there?

03:51:45.004 --> 03:51:47.325
TRAVIS: The back of your binder?!

03:51:47.325 --> 03:51:48.965
SAM: There's a letter in there!

03:51:48.965 --> 03:51:50.247
MARISHA: That's so cool!

03:51:50.247 --> 03:51:52.077
MATT: I can't hand you stuff across the table anymore

03:51:52.077 --> 03:51:53.726
because of the pandemic, so I had to get in there

03:51:53.726 --> 03:51:55.175
a while back and sneak it in there.

03:51:55.175 --> 03:51:57.650
LAURA: You sneaky--!
LIAM: (screams)

03:51:59.227 --> 03:52:01.787
TRAVIS: Don't touch it with your bare hand-- oh god!

03:52:01.787 --> 03:52:04.617
SAM: There has been a murder.

03:52:04.617 --> 03:52:06.317
Everyone here is a suspect.

03:52:06.317 --> 03:52:09.523
LIAM: You are invited to my eldritch birthday party.

03:52:09.523 --> 03:52:11.773
(laughter)

03:52:13.514 --> 03:52:15.089
LAURA: What does it say, Caleb?

03:52:18.827 --> 03:52:20.783
SAM: You may already be a winner.

03:52:22.208 --> 03:52:23.216
LIAM: "Bren,

03:52:24.517 --> 03:52:25.898
"It has come to my attention

03:52:25.898 --> 03:52:27.990
"that you are visiting the capital this day.

03:52:29.357 --> 03:52:31.367
"I must say, word of your patriotic deeds

03:52:31.367 --> 03:52:34.320
"for the Empire give my old heart a warming glow.

03:52:35.577 --> 03:52:37.937
"As I suspected, it seems some pupils

03:52:37.937 --> 03:52:39.747
"can only thrive when you let them go

03:52:39.747 --> 03:52:41.712
"to find their own path a while."

03:52:41.712 --> 03:52:43.012
MARISHA: (whispering) Icky.
TRAVIS: Fuck.

03:52:43.847 --> 03:52:46.567
LIAM: "I'm quite impressed by your accomplishments thus far

03:52:46.567 --> 03:52:49.207
"and would greatly appreciate the presence

03:52:49.207 --> 03:52:50.527
"of you and your companions

03:52:50.527 --> 03:52:53.830
"as dinner guests at my manor tomorrow evening,

03:52:55.647 --> 03:52:58.730
"Astrid and Eodwulf will be joining us as well.

03:53:00.167 --> 03:53:02.997
"So consider this a proper family reunion.

03:53:06.353 --> 03:53:09.542
"I do hope you consider my invitation, Bren.

03:53:10.477 --> 03:53:13.327
"I gather we both have much we would like to say."

03:53:24.756 --> 03:53:26.372
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

03:53:26.372 --> 03:53:30.064
ALL: Oh no!

03:53:30.064 --> 03:53:33.965
TRAVIS: Fucking sneaky-ass DM!

03:53:33.965 --> 03:53:36.019
SAM: I'm going to check the back of mine.

03:53:36.019 --> 03:53:37.597
LAURA: I know, right? Anything?

03:53:37.597 --> 03:53:40.030
SAM: (gasps) He put this in there!

03:53:40.030 --> 03:53:42.154
He's an ad wizard!

03:53:42.154 --> 03:53:45.324
(laughter)

03:53:46.487 --> 03:53:48.017
MARISHA: Wow.

03:53:48.017 --> 03:53:49.497
LIAM: Cool.

03:53:49.497 --> 03:53:53.215
MATT: All righty, we'll pick up on there next episode.

03:53:53.215 --> 03:53:55.357
TRAVIS: I'm so excited.
MARISHA: Wow.

03:53:55.357 --> 03:53:58.026
LIAM: Me too, me too. Eiselcross.

03:53:58.026 --> 03:53:59.562
MARISHA: Eiselcross!

03:53:59.562 --> 03:54:00.797
SAM: Oh, man.

03:54:00.797 --> 03:54:03.467
MATT: This is going to be different.

03:54:03.467 --> 03:54:06.406
All righty, well, thank you all for joining us.

Good night.

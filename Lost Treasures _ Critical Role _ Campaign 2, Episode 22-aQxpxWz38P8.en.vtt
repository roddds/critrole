00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.796
MATT: Hello, and welcome, everybody, to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:09.219
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and shout dirty
things at me and play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Way

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.398
too late on that draw. But yes, welcome! First and
foremost, before we jump into tonight's game, we

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:17.522
have some announcements to get through.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:19.232
LIAM: Testicle roach!

00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:21.744
(dubious noises)

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:27.115
MATT: Before we get into the formal announcements,
first off, those of us who were at the Stream of

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:31.680
Many Eyes this past weekend had a great time. Hope
you guys who tuned in to check out any of it have

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.767
looked on YouTube to see the videos. We had some
fun games with some great DMs-- I had the

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:38.952
opportunity with the Force Grey game-- and we all
got to play with a bunch of other great people in

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:47.729
the community. And Deborah Ann Woll is an amazing
DM. She's pretty badass. But yeah, anyway, hope

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:53.445
you guys enjoyed it. But, bringing us into our
first announcements tonight, we have our fantastic

00:00:53.445 --> 00:01:00.318
returning partner-in-crime for this campaign thus
far: our sponsor, D&amp;amp;D Beyond. Sam.

00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:05.586
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond, everyone. Yeah, there's an
animated thing that, if you haven't seen, you

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:12.199
should check out, that's pretty cool. As announced
during the Stream of Many Eyes this past weekend,

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:17.783
new adventures, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and
Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, are now

00:01:17.783 --> 00:01:24.394
available-- on Laura's phone-- for preorder on D&amp;amp;D
Beyond.

00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:28.200
MATT: Fun note to that, actually, too: the Dragon
Heist adventure, I was one of the story and creative

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.740
consultants on for that book.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.712
LIAM: Humble dragon-brag.

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:37.339
MATT: A little bit, every now and then. But I got
to put a little bit of my flavor on there. So many

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:39.814
great people put it together; I was just happy to
be even a part of that.

00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:41.721
LAURA: I like how none of us knew that.

00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:43.021
(laughter)

00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:46.763
MATT: Great friends, guys. It's really-- just
exemplifies the relationship.

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:48.901
LAURA: What's your name again?

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:54.051
SAM: Check out the D&amp;amp;D Beyond marketplace now to
learn more and order now. And the great thing

00:01:54.051 --> 00:02:02.379
about D&amp;amp;D Beyond, guys, is that it simplifies
managing your stats and inventory so you can just

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:09.286
focus on creating. Creating new encounters,
creating new characters, creating new monsters.

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:14.373
And I thought I would inspire our audience by
showing them what kind of-- some samples of some

00:02:14.373 --> 00:02:20.231
new monsters that they could create. Now, you
could use the same old stats, but maybe you give

00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:26.551
them a little new spin or a new flair. And to
help, I made some artistic interpretations of some

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:31.368
of my new monsters. So these are some new monsters
you can create. You guys have all heard of a

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:40.244
bulette? We fought them? Well, this is a
bull-ette. It's a female bullet! You can tell

00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:41.750
'cause it's pink!

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.028
MARISHA: Did you print out a picture of a bullet?

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:49.869
SAM: Yeah, I printed out a picture of a bullet and
I colored it in pink. And it only fires once, so

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:58.789
it's a very quick encounter. You've heard of a
displacer beast? This is a Despacito beast. It's

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:09.635
the same thing as a displacer beast, except you
hear "dub-a-dub-a Puerto Rico dub-a-dub-a ay,

00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:13.844
bandito" when it goes invisible.

00:03:14.474 --> 00:03:16.525
MATT: They don't actually go invisible, but
continue.

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:19.066
LIAM: Which is a problem, 'cause it blows the
invisibility.

00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:20.845
LAURA: Did your children draw these, or--

00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:26.443
SAM: No, I drew these. You guys have heard of an
owlbear. Well, what about putting a little

00:03:26.443 --> 00:03:34.103
creative spin on it and making it a bowel-bear? It
has crippling IBS. Oh, there's more, guys.

00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:37.334
TRAVIS: It could also be like a fro-yo factory, I
mean, that's not--

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:43.072
SAM: Yeah, it has a shit-spray attack. Here's one
I'm pretty proud of. You guys, there's a monster

00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:49.487
in the Manual called the giant wasp. Well, this is
the giant WASP. But he's a White Anglo-Saxon

00:03:49.487 --> 00:03:56.064
Person. A WASP! You know, a WASP-y guy! He's a
WASP!

00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:00.874
ASHLEY: Is that what the 'P' stands for?

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:01.514
SAM: Yeah!

00:04:02.464 --> 00:04:03.731
MARISHA: I don't think that's--

00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:05.111
SAM: That's not true? I don't know.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.326
MARISHA: I feel like you're reaching.

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:07.893
SAM: Okay, there's two more.

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:09.589
LAURA: Oh my god, please stop.

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:15.788
SAM: Okay, there's two more. This is a bone
dirtdevil. It's a bone devil that cleans up after

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.591
every fight.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.204
LIAM: Did you draw that one, or is it your kid?

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:23.266
SAM: Yeah, I drew that one! Last, but not least,
it's a Fanta-core!

00:04:24.246 --> 00:04:26.366
(laughter)

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.485
SAM: It's just a manticore with Fanta as a head.

00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:33.218
TRAVIS: There's a lot of work going into this. You
can tell. I mean, there are Xeroxed copies.

00:04:33.218 --> 00:04:34.909
SAM: You like the bone dirtdevil?

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:35.948
LAURA: I do.

00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:37.780
TALIESIN: I want a Fanta-core right now.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.241
MATT: Fanta-core, I'm down with.

00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:40.766
TALIESIN: What flavors does the Fanta-core come
in?

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:42.269
MATT: Dangerous and well-branded.

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:48.997
SAM: Guys, there were more that I didn't even
draw. There was the Lin Manuel Miranda-boleth.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.861
(laughter)

00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:56.168
SAM: There was a Nick Frost giant. He always has
Simon Pegg with him.

00:04:56.168 --> 00:04:59.945
(laughter)

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:01.467
SAM: Check out more on my website.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:06.183
MATT: Save those for the next Sam Riegel bundle
you can buy on D&amp;amp;D Beyond six months from now.

00:05:06.183 --> 00:05:08.410
LIAM: I'm pretty sure the only monster here is
you.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.978
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:15.330
LAURA: Sorry, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.110
MATT: To that note too, as well, I released a couple
small updates to the Blood Hunter that went up on

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.029
D&amp;amp;D Beyond as well, as well as on the DMs Guild.
So for those who are playing, check and see if

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.597
there's anything that affects your class. It might
be the case. Minor tweaks, but things that I think

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:37.438
will help improve gameplay and more fun, so. All
right. The standard edition of Vox Machina:

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:45.474
Origins are still for sale, apparently. We're sold
out of the special editions. Seems to be the case.

00:05:45.474 --> 00:05:50.746
But the standard editions are still available. You
can go to critrole.com for information and detail

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:55.139
on that. Or the Geek &amp;amp; Sundry and Alpha online
shops, as where you'll find it for purchase. Let's

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.956
see. Talks Machina, of course, will be happening
about this episode, tonight, next Tuesday at 7 PM

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:05.418
Pacific Time, with our wonderful host, Brian W.
Foster, and a number of our cast members will be

00:06:05.418 --> 00:06:10.811
attending to discuss the insanity that is imminent
to occur this evening. So check that out. Don't

00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:20.651
forget to submit your fanart or gif of the week to
submit@talksmachina.com. And a reminder, through

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.696
Twitch Prime, if you have your Amazon Prime
account, you can connect it with your Twitch

00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:28.395

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:33.309
you haven't.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:34.469
LAURA: For a split-second, you sounded like Kermit
the Frog.

00:06:34.498 --> 00:06:39.049
MATT: (Kermit voice) Oh, I'm just trying to make
sure that you get your proper announcements there

00:06:39.056 --> 00:06:41.560
for your game. Okay. Let's play some D&amp;amp;D.

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:47.063
(laughter)

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:53.467
MATT: (Kermit voice) Roll initiative. (normal
voice) All right, so, on that note, I believe it's

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.018
time to dive into tonight's episode of Critical
Role.

00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:04.215
[click, TV static]

00:07:04.215 --> 00:08:22.439
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:22.477 --> 00:08:24.864
MATT: Hello, and welcome back.

00:08:24.864 --> 00:08:27.307
(laughter)

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:30.345
TRAVIS: Oh man, that's a good one. Winner. That's
a blue-ribbon echelon.

00:08:32.485 --> 00:08:35.923
LIAM: (tearfully) I just thought of it five
seconds ago and I'm so happy.

00:08:35.923 --> 00:08:38.086
MATT: Welcome back, everybody.

00:08:38.086 --> 00:08:40.487
(laughter)

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:50.330
MATT: So. Where we last left off, the Mighty Nein
have been making their way towards Beleben and the

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:56.409
Labenda Swamp to tackle the first of their two
tasks they had taken from the Gentleman in Zadash.

00:08:56.409 --> 00:09:03.033
Traveling along the way, you managed to save and
make friends with a very young kenku named Kiri

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:09.740
who has been accompanying you through your journey
thus far. You managed to find an individual who

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:15.136
could guide you through the swamp, who was
summarily taken and probably eaten by a troll that

00:09:15.136 --> 00:09:20.671
was stalking you through the swamp. You found an
ally named Cali, Calianna, who was a

00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:29.574
dragon-blooded sorcerer who seemed to have aligned
interests towards the direction you were traveling

00:09:29.574 --> 00:09:34.705
to find the safe house that belonged to the
Gentleman that had gone quiet. Upon hearing that

00:09:34.705 --> 00:09:38.588
there had been some sort of attack on it, all of
you went through the swamp, forded the dangers,

00:09:38.588 --> 00:09:44.826
made your way to the base of the tree, where it
was discovered to be within and below the base of

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:48.757
this large banyan tree on the northern side of the
Labenda Swamp.

00:09:49.257 --> 00:09:50.932
LAURA: Is it called a bangin' tree?

00:09:50.932 --> 00:09:57.650
MATT: Banyan. It's a bangin' tree. Just want you
to know, of all the trees I've seen, it's pretty

00:09:57.688 --> 00:10:03.757
bangin'. After investigating the scene and trying
to pick up details about what had transpired, you

00:10:03.757 --> 00:10:08.567
found a number of bodies that had been put up,
left to bloat, and die as a warning for those who

00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:12.286
had made their way in. On the inside, it looks
like the interior of the safe house had been

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:17.185
cleaned out and summarily dragged through a
subterranean tunnel. Following this tunnel down

00:10:17.185 --> 00:10:24.477
below, you found strange, twisted-looking merfolk
called merrow that seemed to have been living in

00:10:24.477 --> 00:10:32.194
these partially submerged tunnels, this system
beneath the swamp. You engaged in battle, killed a

00:10:32.194 --> 00:10:37.256
number of them, and upon sifting through some of
the remnants of what was dragged out of the safe

00:10:37.256 --> 00:10:42.529
house, you discovered Cali's quarry, which was a
bowl that could speak to the Scaled Tyrant,

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:48.687
Tiamat. You decided what to do, and after a brief
confrontation, the bowl was handed over to Yasha,

00:10:48.687 --> 00:10:54.997
who attempted to sunder it using her Magician's
Judge, which succeeded: the item was left

00:10:54.997 --> 00:11:00.828
shattered into pieces. Cali, with her quest
complete and not wishing to put herself into any

00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:07.750
further danger, decided to leave, bidding you all
adieu, and clambered back up through the strange,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:16.339
dug tunnel that leads to the surface. You guys
were left to think about what the next course of

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:22.845
action was before Fjord made a brief swimming
excursion into one of the far-off tunnels that led

00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:30.149
to a larger chamber and a base of operations where
more of these merrow live. From the outskirts of

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:36.274
what you could see, more remnants of what was
taken from the safe house existed further in.

00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:46.417
Mighty Nein, you've seen Cali clamber off. You
guys have taken down from the heat of the moment.

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:48.855
What do you wish to do?

00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:51.347
TRAVIS: We got to rest up, right?

00:11:52.197 --> 00:11:53.404
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm a little tired.

00:11:53.404 --> 00:11:54.826
LAURA: We should probably sleep.

00:11:54.826 --> 00:11:59.929
SAM: But there's fish men and possibly fish women
right down there that could come out and kill us

00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:01.298
in our sleep.

00:12:01.298 --> 00:12:03.767
TRAVIS: I think Caleb has a little booby trap for
that, don't you?

00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:09.653
LIAM: Caleb starts silver threading the entrance
that Fjord swam through.

00:12:09.653 --> 00:12:11.625
TALIESIN: I say we sleep upstairs.

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:13.005
LAURA: Upstairs?

00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:16.297
TALIESIN: Pull the rope up, that way we'll have
plenty of time if we hear them coming back up.

00:12:16.297 --> 00:12:17.734
TRAVIS: Add some distance, yeah.

00:12:17.734 --> 00:12:22.938
LAURA and TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay.

00:12:22.948 --> 00:12:26.703
SAM: What if there's unlimited numbers of them?
What if there's a whole--

00:12:26.703 --> 00:12:28.182
TRAVIS: I only saw, like, five.

00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:31.471
SAM: You only saw like five. Did you keep going
down into the tunnels?

00:12:31.471 --> 00:12:36.426
TRAVIS: No, but I got pretty fucking sharp eyes,
all right? They call me Eagle-Eye Fjord where I

00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:37.342
come from.

00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:38.384
LAURA: Did they really?

00:12:38.384 --> 00:12:42.958
TRAVIS: (cawing) Crow Fjord, or maybe raven, you
don't know.

00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.606
MARISHA: That's a lot of nicknames.

00:12:44.606 --> 00:12:45.751
TRAVIS: It is.

00:12:46.731 --> 00:12:48.894
TALIESIN: With the warning system, we'll have
plenty of time to get away if there's too many of

00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:52.256
them and they'll have no way up if we pull the
rope up.

00:12:52.256 --> 00:12:56.181
LAURA: Well, what will we put in the doorway of
the tree, though?

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:59.684
TRAVIS: I don't know if we leave the tree.

00:12:59.823 --> 00:13:02.216
LAURA: No, are we sleeping in the tree?

00:13:02.262 --> 00:13:03.302
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:13:03.302 --> 00:13:05.020
TALIESIN: People will keep watch.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.395
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:13:07.235 --> 00:13:10.497
TALIESIN: That way we'll have an early warning
before they even manage to crawl their way up.

00:13:10.497 --> 00:13:12.280
TRAVIS: And we know where the entrance is.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:18.310
LIAM: The moment that they exit the pool, we'll
know and it would wake me up, or you up, or

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.579
anybody up.

00:13:19.579 --> 00:13:23.962
SAM: We're just going to gloss over the fact that
Fjord has three bird nicknames?

00:13:24.492 --> 00:13:27.484
LAURA: Bird-Eye Fjord I think is what he was
getting at, you know?

00:13:27.484 --> 00:13:29.081
TRAVIS: Also very popular.

00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:31.480
MATT: Kiri pipes up. (like Jester) "Bird-Eye
Fjord."

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.157
TRAVIS: That's right, Kiri, Bird-Eye Fjord.

00:13:34.157 --> 00:13:35.666
MATT: (like Jester) "Bird-Eye Fjord."

00:13:35.666 --> 00:13:36.788
TRAVIS: It's sticking.

00:13:36.788 --> 00:13:38.185
MATT: (like Fjord) "Sticking."

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:39.460
SAM: That does not sound good.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.556
MARISHA: Can we call you B.E.F. for short?
Bird-Eye Fjord.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:50.509
TRAVIS: No. We make our way up the rope into the
bottom of the tree, but the entrance is still open.

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:55.439
MATT: Okay. As you guys are making your way up and
climbing using the roots and the rope and the

00:13:55.488 --> 00:14:00.308
interior, you begin to, now that you're not
focused on what's below, notice that a lot of the

00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:05.338
earth in this particular tunnel-- that isn't too
wide necessarily, it's about three feet wide in

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:11.633
most places-- You can see the claw marks where
it's been dug out. The softer portion of the

00:14:11.633 --> 00:14:16.994
ground where you landed upon emerging from making
your way down, you can see a lot of the earth and chunks of

00:14:16.994 --> 00:14:24.424
root that have been carved out. It wasn't a natural
tunnel or something they discovered; they dug up

00:14:24.474 --> 00:14:30.155
into the safe house to retrieve whatever was
inside. Nevertheless, you all make your way up

00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:38.521
into the hollow base of the safe house tree. You
guys can set up camp if you'd like to.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:44.037
TRAVIS: I'll take first watch, if you want. I can
post up outside and do a little illusion work.

00:14:44.928 --> 00:14:45.885
MARISHA: I'll join you.

00:14:47.475 --> 00:14:57.023
LAURA: I'm going to spend a little time with Kiri.
I want to teach you some sayings. How long can you

00:14:57.086 --> 00:14:58.958
keep mimicking things?

00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:02.118
MATT: (like Jester) "Mimicking things."

00:15:02.118 --> 00:15:03.950
LAURA: I'm going to take that as a long time.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.197
MATT: (like Jester) "Long time."

00:15:05.197 --> 00:15:10.953
LAURA: Okay, good. I'm going to tell you if
someone asks what your name is, you say, "I am Kiri."

00:15:10.953 --> 00:15:12.305
MATT: (like Jester) "I am Kiri."

00:15:12.305 --> 00:15:17.944
LAURA: See, look at this, this is great! Okay, and
then if they go, "Are you nice?" You say, "Yes,

00:15:17.944 --> 00:15:19.247
"I'm very sweet."

00:15:19.247 --> 00:15:21.148
MATT: (like Jester) "Yes, I'm very sweet."

00:15:23.508 --> 00:15:26.908
LAURA: If they say something you don't like, you
say, "Go fuck yourself."

00:15:26.947 --> 00:15:28.463
MATT: (like Jester) "Go fuck yourself."

00:15:28.463 --> 00:15:29.397
LAURA: Yes.

00:15:29.397 --> 00:15:31.070
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I can't believe you said it.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.515
SAM: It's like a sound board.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.633
TRAVIS: Go fuck yourself.

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:34.769
LAURA: You say, "Fuck yourself."

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:36.021
MATT: (like Jester) "Go fuck yourself."

00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:38.958
LAURA: Yes, that's good. Okay, that's a good
start.

00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.521
SAM: Wait, if you get really excited, you should
go (air horn blaring).

00:15:43.481 --> 00:15:45.594
MATT: (air horn blaring)

00:15:45.594 --> 00:15:47.804
LAURA: Oh no, don't do that, Kiri! Don't!

00:15:47.804 --> 00:15:54.208
LIAM: Frumpkin's hair gets poofed out and his tail
floofs out and he starts growling at the sound.

00:15:59.778 --> 00:16:01.121
MARISHA: Hey, Fjord.

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:02.042
TRAVIS: Yeah?

00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:02.975
SAM: Are we going to sleep?

00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:03.949
LAURA: I think so.

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:06.715
TRAVIS: About what time is it, anyway? Light still
coming in from the outside of the tree?

00:16:08.755 --> 00:16:15.302
MATT: At this point, it's probably just past dusk.
There's a little bit of blue cresting into night

00:16:15.302 --> 00:16:18.382
time. Light's coming through the trees, but it
looks like you're about half an hour out from a

00:16:18.382 --> 00:16:19.674
pitch black sky.

00:16:19.674 --> 00:16:20.756
TRAVIS: All right.

00:16:20.756 --> 00:16:23.549
LIAM: Is it my turn with the dodecahedron?

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:24.931
LAURA: Oh yes! Do you want it?

00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:26.121
LIAM: I do.

00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:27.173
SAM: For today?

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:32.211
LAURA: But wait for the morning, unless you want
to use it today, and then somebody else will get

00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:36.396
it in the morning. Because it only lasts for 24
hours.

00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:37.810
LIAM: Did you use it?

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:43.244
SAM: I did not. Oh, I did. We have to save it for
tomorrow.

00:16:44.224 --> 00:16:46.560
LIAM: I more want to examine it.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:52.182
LAURA: Oh, yes, here. Do you want to take it out
of the bag?

00:16:52.182 --> 00:16:53.765
LIAM: No. Can I borrow the bag?

00:16:53.765 --> 00:16:55.135
LAURA: Here's the bag.

00:16:59.725 --> 00:17:06.212
LIAM: I'm going to spend maybe a half-hour before
bed not trying to use it, but just examine it.

00:17:06.212 --> 00:17:09.709
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check.

00:17:13.749 --> 00:17:14.600
LIAM: 15.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:26.644
MATT: Okay. Assessing its design, paying attention
to its construct and the handles, and the edging

00:17:26.685 --> 00:17:37.078
of where the different facets of it are affixed to
this cage-like exterior to it, you really have no

00:17:37.078 --> 00:17:44.925
idea what material it's made from. The faint
magical essence that comes off of it, and with the

00:17:44.925 --> 00:17:52.902
training you have had across the various schools
of magic, this seems hard to pin down. You're not

00:17:52.902 --> 00:18:05.232
sure the source of its magic, but it does seem
very old. It seems like it's been shaped or it's

00:18:05.232 --> 00:18:11.181
been polished from whatever its raw form was at
one point in time.

00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:17.522
LIAM: Well, this evening I'm going to use it for
the grand purpose of being my pillow in the bag,

00:18:17.522 --> 00:18:19.137
so I'm going to sleep.

00:18:19.137 --> 00:18:20.439
MATT: Okay.

00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:22.406
LIAM: It's in the bag.

00:18:22.406 --> 00:18:25.074
LAURA: (whispers) I'm putting it back on my
body.

00:18:25.074 --> 00:18:26.659
LIAM: Does my head do this?

00:18:26.659 --> 00:18:28.071
LAURA: Oh, you were sleeping on it?

00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:29.380
MATT: Yeah, using it as a pillow.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.651
LAURA: Just kidding!

00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:34.817
MARISHA: Hey, Fjord.

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.075
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:18:36.075 --> 00:18:37.493
MARISHA: Let me ask you something.

00:18:37.493 --> 00:18:38.697
TRAVIS: Shoot.

00:18:40.217 --> 00:18:51.003
MARISHA: I think I messed up. I think maybe I
should apologize to Caleb. I'm not very good at

00:18:51.003 --> 00:18:56.839
apologizing, though. I was wondering if maybe you
could give me some pointers for apologizing.

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:59.308
TRAVIS: You're not good at apologizing?

00:18:59.308 --> 00:19:01.253
MARISHA: You're being facetious, aren't you?

00:19:01.253 --> 00:19:06.684
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm fucking with you. You reckon you
need to apologize?

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:13.977
MARISHA: I probably got a little too aggressive,
probably shouldn't have grabbed him like that. Got

00:19:13.977 --> 00:19:19.614
a little too angry. That's not necessarily my good
side, you know, don't like people seeing that.

00:19:20.254 --> 00:19:26.104
TRAVIS: You know, a great place to start with
apologies is to mention the stuff you just said.

00:19:28.524 --> 00:19:30.286
MARISHA: That I'm not good at apologies?

00:19:30.286 --> 00:19:32.504
TRAVIS: No, after that, right.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.503
MARISHA: I got a little too aggressive?

00:19:34.503 --> 00:19:35.673
TRAVIS: One.

00:19:35.673 --> 00:19:37.174
MARISHA: And I have a bad side.

00:19:37.174 --> 00:19:38.173
TRAVIS: Dos.

00:19:38.173 --> 00:19:40.794
MARISHA: And I shouldn't have done it.

00:19:41.524 --> 00:19:43.264
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a really good apology.

00:19:43.264 --> 00:19:44.393
MARISHA: Is that pretty good?

00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:54.467
TRAVIS: Yeah. However, right? Be genuine. Don't be
embarrassed to apologize. It takes a big person to

00:19:54.467 --> 00:20:00.624
apologize for something. Little people are the
ones that make mistakes and just let them go.

00:20:01.254 --> 00:20:03.488
MARISHA: Oh, like Nott? A little person.

00:20:03.488 --> 00:20:06.528
TRAVIS: No, like small on the inside.

00:20:06.528 --> 00:20:08.323
MARISHA: Right, like in your soul.

00:20:08.323 --> 00:20:10.492
TRAVIS: That's big of you.

00:20:11.532 --> 00:20:17.945
MARISHA: It's, you know, I want to try, I guess.

00:20:17.945 --> 00:20:22.285
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think he deserves that. He's been
good to us.

00:20:22.285 --> 00:20:23.797
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so.

00:20:24.747 --> 00:20:25.438
TRAVIS: All right.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:27.366
MARISHA: Hopefully it goes well.

00:20:28.486 --> 00:20:33.294
TRAVIS: I think it will. You can actually leave
the smile out of it this time, just to be clear.

00:20:33.294 --> 00:20:36.625
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Not like: I'm sorry!

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:40.476
TRAVIS: No, that's going to set the tone in a real
weird way. There's a thing called sarcasm that you

00:20:40.476 --> 00:20:42.283
ride a line with sometimes.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.513
MARISHA: Okay, that's good to know.

00:20:47.733 --> 00:20:51.379
MATT: All right, the rest of you find yourselves
to sleep, or is there anything else you wish to do

00:20:51.427 --> 00:20:57.505
before the night's done? Any order of taking
watch, or are you all just resting under the

00:20:57.505 --> 00:20:59.204
protection of Caleb's silver thread?

00:20:59.204 --> 00:21:00.509
TRAVIS: No. Beau and I are up first.

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:01.501
LAURA: I'll do second.

00:21:01.501 --> 00:21:02.604
MATT: Okay.

00:21:02.604 --> 00:21:04.428
SAM: Second as well.

00:21:04.428 --> 00:21:08.039
MATT: We'll say that was for your first watch.
While you guys are having that conversation, one

00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:12.244
of you roll with advantage on your perception
check, or you can both roll separately, your call.

00:21:12.244 --> 00:21:17.466
MARISHA: Let's roll separately. Oof, terrible.

00:21:17.466 --> 00:21:21.351
TRAVIS: Yep. Five.

00:21:21.351 --> 00:21:22.484
MARISHA: Five.

00:21:22.484 --> 00:21:24.502
MATT: Oh, leave him hanging.

00:21:24.502 --> 00:21:28.071
LAURA: Her perception is low, you wouldn't see the
high five.

00:21:28.071 --> 00:21:29.322
MATT: That's true.

00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:31.231
MARISHA: Five? Oh five!

00:21:31.231 --> 00:21:33.007
MATT: Good in-character moment there.

00:21:37.457 --> 00:21:45.308
As you guys are finishing your conversation,
your watch comes to an end without incident.

00:21:45.308 --> 00:21:49.785
TRAVIS: With an arrow in our throat? I didn't
see-- (choking)

00:21:50.715 --> 00:21:55.101
MATT: You rest so easily with the blood leaking
out. You finish your watch, you wake up Nott and

00:21:55.101 --> 00:21:59.776
Jester, and you guys take on your second watch. Do
you want to both make a roll for perception or--

00:21:59.776 --> 00:22:01.443
LAURA: Let's roll separately!

00:22:01.443 --> 00:22:02.938
MATT: Okay! Worked out great last time.

00:22:02.938 --> 00:22:04.091
LAURA: Yeah.

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.716
SAM: That's a four.

00:22:05.716 --> 00:22:09.295
LAURA: Oh no. I think it's 12 for me.

00:22:11.495 --> 00:22:12.057
MATT: Okay.

00:22:12.057 --> 00:22:13.606
SAM: High roll!

00:22:15.216 --> 00:22:20.902
MATT: While you guys are taking some time, concentrating
on listening out for anything and feeling pretty

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:27.684
solid in your ability to maintain vigil across
this dark, eerie night in the center of this

00:22:27.684 --> 00:22:34.108
hollow tree, you don't hear or see a goddamned
thing. But a little twinkle hits your ears, Caleb.

00:22:34.108 --> 00:22:35.765
SAM: Oh shit!

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:43.270
MATT: As suddenly something down below, by
the pool on the opposite end of that kidney-shaped

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.521
interior cavern, seems to go off.

00:22:46.521 --> 00:22:47.766
LIAM: I'm awake?

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:50.077
MATT: Yes, you come to consciousness.

00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:51.075
LIAM: They're awake?

00:22:51.075 --> 00:22:52.510
MATT: They are awake.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.910
LIAM: Ah, fish, Nott.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.790
SAM: No, we're on watch. We haven't seen anything,
it's just a dream.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.838
LIAM: No, down below, in my--

00:22:59.838 --> 00:23:01.990
LAURA: In the cavern? In the tunnel?

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.985
LIAM: Yeah.

00:23:02.985 --> 00:23:05.782
LAURA: What should we do? Should we wake everyone
up?

00:23:05.782 --> 00:23:07.037
SAM: We should wake everyone up!

00:23:07.037 --> 00:23:07.935
LIAM: Wake up!

00:23:07.935 --> 00:23:08.775
MARISHA: Ow!

00:23:08.775 --> 00:23:10.513
LAURA: Wake up!

00:23:10.513 --> 00:23:12.042
SAM: Fjord! (cawing)

00:23:13.192 --> 00:23:14.142
TRAVIS: What, what?

00:23:15.202 --> 00:23:18.493
SAM: Don't wake up Kiri, though. She deserves a
really nice night's sleep.

00:23:18.493 --> 00:23:20.066
LAURA: She really does, let her sleep.

00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:24.026
MATT: She's all curled up in the corner, like
(trilling) with her feathers all poofed up.

00:23:24.026 --> 00:23:26.060
SAM: I'm going to give her my blanket.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.930
LIAM: I'm going to send Frumpkin to crawl down and
get a look.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.908
MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check for Frumpkin.

00:23:32.908 --> 00:23:35.018
LAURA: Does Frumpkin fall down the tunnel, then?

00:23:36.468 --> 00:23:38.515
MATT: Cats can do some pretty crazy shit.

00:23:38.515 --> 00:23:40.601
LIAM: It's fine. Good, four.

00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:54.473
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin drops down onto the soft and
makes it around. Focusing on it, you can see that

00:23:54.473 --> 00:24:01.742
another merrow has emerged into that chamber and--
nope.

00:24:03.492 --> 00:24:05.179
LAURA: We didn't hide the bodies.

00:24:07.459 --> 00:24:13.505
MATT: Goes around and sees the bodies there lying
in the middle of the space. He (growls).

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.189
LIAM: Oh, we left the corpses out.

00:24:17.479 --> 00:24:18.219
LAURA: Oops.

00:24:18.219 --> 00:24:23.740
MATT: He goes and drags him back a little bit,
begins rifling through whatever it might have had,

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:32.339
and looks over right at Frumpkin. Grabs the
trident spear and throws it.

00:24:33.479 --> 00:24:35.045
LAURA: Did you snap him out?

00:24:35.094 --> 00:24:36.687
LIAM: I don't know.

00:24:36.687 --> 00:24:38.243
MATT: You weren't close enough to do that, I don't
think.

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:39.766
LIAM: No? 100 feet.

00:24:39.766 --> 00:24:44.558
MATT: 100 feet to snap him back, or is it
shorter than that? Double-check on that real fast.

00:24:44.558 --> 00:24:48.168
LAURA: Oh, again, again!

00:24:48.168 --> 00:24:49.500
TALIESIN: Kitten kebab.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.462
SAM: I remember saying that we should hide the
corpses and Cali actually said, "Don't do it,

00:24:54.503 --> 00:24:57.696
"there's no point to it." So we should blame Cali.

00:24:58.786 --> 00:25:00.763
LAURA: I don't remember Cali saying that.

00:25:00.763 --> 00:25:02.289
SAM: That's what Cali said.

00:25:04.539 --> 00:25:09.132
LIAM: I actually have no memory of anything on
range for bamfing in and out, but I will defer to

00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:10.566
you because you're my DM.

00:25:11.736 --> 00:25:17.425
MATT: "As an action, you can temporarily dismiss
your familiar." It doesn't say range. "You can

00:25:17.473 --> 00:25:24.515
"cause it to reappear within 30 feet of you."
That's what I forgot. So you can do that. The last

00:25:24.515 --> 00:25:30.791
thing you see, briefly, before Frumpkin vanishes,
is this three-pronged trident rocking through the

00:25:30.791 --> 00:25:36.658
darkness, with what faint little bit of visibility
that Frumpkin has, not even being able to see much

00:25:36.658 --> 00:25:39.478
down there in the darkness before disappearing.

00:25:42.238 --> 00:25:44.999
LIAM: Ja, there is one down there right now and
he tried to kill my cat.

00:25:44.999 --> 00:25:47.464
LAURA: Should we go down there or should we stay up here?

00:25:47.464 --> 00:25:51.521
TRAVIS: Hit the wall against the hole, right?
We'll take either side of it, either flank.

00:25:51.521 --> 00:25:53.332
SAM: Why don't we just blow up the hole?

00:25:53.332 --> 00:25:55.077
TRAVIS: No, because we still want to go down
there.

00:25:55.077 --> 00:25:57.528
SAM: Why do we want to go down there? There's
crazy people down there!

00:25:57.528 --> 00:25:59.608
LAURA: Nott, shut up! Because there's treasure and
stuff.

00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:01.299
SAM: You could just say, "Be quiet."

00:26:01.299 --> 00:26:02.751
LAURA: Nott, please be quiet.

00:26:02.801 --> 00:26:03.810
SAM: Thank you.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.533
TRAVIS: Molly, I want you to get right on the edge
of the hole and keep an eye down the shaft.

00:26:07.533 --> 00:26:10.908
MATT: (chirping) (like Jester) "Go fuck
yourself."

00:26:10.908 --> 00:26:12.453
LAURA: Oh, I love her!

00:26:12.453 --> 00:26:14.684
SAM: We woke her up, though, but it was cute.

00:26:14.684 --> 00:26:16.292
LAURA: Kiri, (shushing).

00:26:18.752 --> 00:26:24.823
LIAM: Am I able to prepare Magic Missile like a
held spell for a fish head popping out of the hole?

00:26:26.243 --> 00:26:29.736
MATT: Holding your action, if it comes back
around, the spell is either fizzled or released.

00:26:29.736 --> 00:26:33.832
So you can wait for something and then cast the
spell as an action.

00:26:33.832 --> 00:26:35.589
LIAM: But I'd lose the slot if I held the--

00:26:37.249 --> 00:26:39.784
MATT: If you ended up holding it for a few minutes,
yes, because the idea is that you're casting the

00:26:39.822 --> 00:26:42.538
spell and then holding onto that last piece of the
incantation.

00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:44.633
LIAM: I won't do that, then, but I will watch the
hole.

00:26:44.633 --> 00:26:46.425
SAM: Is our rope still dangling down the hole?

00:26:46.425 --> 00:26:47.690
MATT: No, you pulled the rope up.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.598
LAURA: I'm going to hold Sacred Flame because it's
a cantrip.

00:26:51.598 --> 00:26:57.316
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate one sword, hold it
behind my back, sit at the edge, and wait to give

00:26:57.316 --> 00:27:00.322
a swing. See if anything is going to pop up.

00:27:01.702 --> 00:27:03.753
TRAVIS: Let it come all the way up if it does.

00:27:06.503 --> 00:27:09.111
SAM: If it comes up, should we grab it?

00:27:10.401 --> 00:27:12.041
TRAVIS: Grapple it, fall flat, kill it quietly.

00:27:13.461 --> 00:27:15.412
MATT: You guys take a moment in silence.

00:27:15.412 --> 00:27:18.749
LAURA: It might be going back and telling its
friends, though, and they're all going to come back.

00:27:18.749 --> 00:27:21.590
MARISHA: You think those guys have strong family
bonds?

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.172
LAURA: Probably.

00:27:23.172 --> 00:27:28.542
MATT: Two minutes pass. Three minutes pass.

00:27:29.462 --> 00:27:32.465
LAURA: Oh no. What if it digs up a hole in another
area, you guys?

00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:44.900
MATT: Then you hear this ever-so-faint grinding of
root on scale. This merrow sentinel slides,

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:52.432
slithering like a snake out of the curtain of
roots that currently cover that one portion of the

00:27:52.432 --> 00:28:01.165
wall that leads further beneath the safe house.
All of you guys take a surprise round. As soon as

00:28:01.165 --> 00:28:03.732
it emerges to go ahead and inspect, it's like,
"Huh?"

00:28:03.732 --> 00:28:06.421
TRAVIS: It came up the tunnel that was already
there?

00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:09.620
MATT: Yeah. It emerged and jack-in-the-boxed out
towards you.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.275
LAURA: Dex save of 15.

00:28:12.255 --> 00:28:13.865
MATT: That is a four, nope!

00:28:18.235 --> 00:28:19.733
LAURA: Ten radiant damage.

00:28:20.453 --> 00:28:22.105
MATT: Ten radiant damage. Good to know.

00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:27.026
SAM: I fired and missed with a natural one.

00:28:27.026 --> 00:28:29.161
MATT: Oh, buddy. (whoosh) Nothing.

00:28:30.491 --> 00:28:32.607
TALIESIN: Just a standard attack, or standard and
bonus?

00:28:34.487 --> 00:28:39.282
MATT: For the purpose of it all happening at once,
just one attack.

00:28:39.282 --> 00:28:41.402
TALIESIN: Two strikes or one strike?

00:28:41.402 --> 00:28:43.166
MATT: Two strikes. It's whatever your attack
action is.

00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:46.972
TALIESIN: That's awful. 11?

00:28:46.972 --> 00:28:48.246
MATT: Misses.

00:28:48.246 --> 00:28:49.934
TALIESIN: And an eight.

00:28:49.934 --> 00:28:53.684
MATT: Both miss. Unfortunately, because you guys
don't have any light in here, when it emerges,

00:28:53.684 --> 00:28:57.235
you're all swinging in the darkness hoping to hit
it in the direction of where it is.

00:28:57.235 --> 00:29:00.318
LIAM: I have no lights up, so I should be at
disadvantage, right?

00:29:00.318 --> 00:29:01.520
MATT: You would be, yes.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.157
LIAM: I'm going to roll again. What does that say?

00:29:05.157 --> 00:29:07.042
MATT: Is this Magic Missile?

00:29:07.042 --> 00:29:12.280
LIAM: No, I had to Fire Bolt so it wouldn't matter
how long I held it. My lower is a 12.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.527
MATT: That misses.

00:29:13.527 --> 00:29:21.665
MARISHA: I rolled a 20 total. That's 11 damage. My
second attack missed.

00:29:21.665 --> 00:29:22.982
MATT: All right.

00:29:22.982 --> 00:29:26.098
TRAVIS: I did Eldritch Blast and a 20 and a 24.

00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:27.665
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:30.784
TRAVIS: Ten and a nine. 19 points of Eldritch
Blast.

00:29:30.784 --> 00:29:32.134
MATT: All righty.

00:29:32.134 --> 00:29:34.974
ASHLEY: I rolled a ten, total.

00:29:34.974 --> 00:29:36.462
MATT: On your first attack?

00:29:36.462 --> 00:29:42.668
ASHLEY: Second attack. There we go. That's a 21.

00:29:42.688 --> 00:29:44.801
TALIESIN: Someone hit something. Yay.

00:29:48.511 --> 00:29:51.148
LAURA: You should really separate out your dice,
Ashley.

00:29:51.148 --> 00:29:53.091
ASHLEY: I know it's making you crazy.

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:55.037
TRAVIS: Monstrous or--?

00:29:56.247 --> 00:30:02.001
MATT: They are considered monstrosities, so
consider that for any damage you deal to them with

00:30:02.001 --> 00:30:03.131
your sword.

00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:04.269
TRAVIS: I will.

00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:11.610
MATT: You're not raging, so you don't have the
plus two. Nor do you have your--

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.389
ASHLEY: Path of Divine.

00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:14.813
MATT: Correct, because you're not raging.

00:30:16.473 --> 00:30:17.344
ASHLEY: It's ten.

00:30:20.244 --> 00:30:23.443
MATT: That's enough. Even with all of your misses,
you watch as it emerges, and then (multiple impacts)

00:30:23.464 --> 00:30:28.014
and slumps. Yeah, as you grab it, it
starts sliding back into the tunnel. You grab and

00:30:28.014 --> 00:30:34.504
lift him-- he's heavy as shit-- and you all
together manage to slip it into and onto the floor.

00:30:34.504 --> 00:30:36.201
LIAM: I just watched all that.

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:38.404
TALIESIN: I'm staying on guard in case anything
else comes through.

00:30:38.404 --> 00:30:39.411
MATT: Fair enough.

00:30:39.411 --> 00:30:40.458
TRAVIS: Yeah, same.

00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:43.454
MATT: What little bit of light you have in the
chamber right now is a little faint, radiant glow

00:30:43.454 --> 00:30:47.617
from the sword that Molly currently has that is
like candlelight, if anything.

00:30:47.617 --> 00:30:51.370
LIAM: I'm going to pull out a rag and do my veiled
lantern thing with Dancing Lights.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.197
LAURA: You should probably put another one of
those things up, Caleb.

00:30:54.197 --> 00:30:55.890
LIAM: Put one of what things up?

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.335
LAURA: Another alarm!

00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:59.929
LIAM: Down there? You want me to go down there?

00:30:59.929 --> 00:31:01.241
ASHLEY: Do you want me to go with you?

00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:02.693
TRAVIS: Yeah, you and Yasha go.

00:31:02.693 --> 00:31:04.036
ASHLEY: Okay, let's go.

00:31:04.036 --> 00:31:05.128
SAM and LAURA: No!

00:31:06.248 --> 00:31:07.833
LIAM: I'm going to send Frumpkin down again.

00:31:09.503 --> 00:31:12.069
MATT: Frumpkin emerges, you send Frumpkin back
down. Make a stealth check for Frumpkin.

00:31:12.069 --> 00:31:15.547
LIAM: Come on, Frumpy. Nine.

00:31:16.537 --> 00:31:17.957
TRAVIS: Nein!

00:31:17.957 --> 00:31:27.741
MATT: The loudest cat you've ever heard. Frumpkin
is the neighborhood cat in heat at this point. He

00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:31.031
makes his way down through the tunnel. Make a
perception check with disadvantage for Frumpkin

00:31:31.031 --> 00:31:33.322
because he's now coming around the edge.

00:31:35.482 --> 00:31:40.320
LIAM: Someone told me that cats have advantage on
perception. Are they full of shit? You're my DM.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.810
Would it cancel out, is why I'm asking?

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:48.488
MATT: Would it cancel out? I would ask you to keep
the stats of your cat on you for future reference.

00:31:49.498 --> 00:31:50.138
LIAM: I will.

00:31:55.478 --> 00:31:59.789
MATT: They have advantage on wisdom perception
checks that rely on smell. I'd say sure.

00:31:59.789 --> 00:32:01.064
LIAM: So cancel?

00:32:01.064 --> 00:32:02.673
MATT: Yeah, it'll cancel out, so a straight roll.

00:32:02.673 --> 00:32:05.312
LAURA: And it's a fish. Cats are really perceptive
when it comes to fish.

00:32:09.502 --> 00:32:12.536
LIAM: That's pretty good. Perception, 19.

00:32:13.456 --> 00:32:17.283
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin heads on down, keeps an eye
out on that space, does a little pass. No sign of

00:32:17.283 --> 00:32:21.802
any other emerging or present merrow.

00:32:21.802 --> 00:32:26.030
TALIESIN: Instead of putting another wire down
there, you could leave Frumpkin down there, and he

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.845
can alert us if there's any problem.

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:29.517
TRAVIS: But he's got to stay awake for it.

00:32:30.507 --> 00:32:38.496
LIAM: He could watch, but the alarm is just as
good. It's automatic, gets me up, Frumpkin can

00:32:38.496 --> 00:32:40.067
sleep. After you.

00:32:40.067 --> 00:32:41.627
SAM: You're going down there?

00:32:41.627 --> 00:32:42.580
LIAM: Ja.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.522
SAM: By yourselves?

00:32:44.522 --> 00:32:45.802
LAURA: With Yasha.

00:32:45.802 --> 00:32:46.919
ASHLEY: With me.

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:48.199
SAM: Take good care of him.

00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:49.208
ASHLEY: I will.

00:32:49.208 --> 00:32:51.631
TALIESIN: If we hear anything, we're going to
charge down there. They'll be fine.

00:32:51.631 --> 00:32:53.698
SAM: He can't make it without you.

00:32:53.698 --> 00:32:55.494
ASHLEY: I know.

00:32:58.204 --> 00:32:59.992
SAM: He will not come back alive.

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:08.024
ASHLEY: I know. I will take care of him as best as
I can. Even better than that, I will take care of

00:33:08.024 --> 00:33:10.702
him. I promise you, he will not die.

00:33:10.702 --> 00:33:13.579
SAM: He will have no chance of survival. Okay.

00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:18.524
MATT: Slowly lowering the rope back down the
tunnel, which one of you is taking point on

00:33:18.524 --> 00:33:20.170
climbing down?

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.522
ASHLEY: I will go first.

00:33:21.522 --> 00:33:26.681
MATT: You make your way down, the rope aiding you
in the process. You get to the bottom, you as

00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:30.484
well. I'd like you both to roll stealth checks,
please, as you emerge in the lower cavern.

00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:38.407
LIAM: 12.

00:33:38.757 --> 00:33:39.513
ASHLEY: 13.

00:33:41.493 --> 00:33:48.997
MATT: You two gingerly step your way around the
edge, back to the site you can see of the three

00:33:48.997 --> 00:33:52.374
corpses of the merrow there in the center of the
opposite side of the cavern.

00:33:52.374 --> 00:33:56.244
LIAM: I have my hand on Yasha's enormous, rippling
shoulder.

00:34:00.194 --> 00:34:04.481
MATT: As you make your way around to the other
pool, you can see the water, disturbed relatively

00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:11.665
recently, isn't perfectly still, but it's nearing
there. It's coming to rest. No sign of anything

00:34:11.665 --> 00:34:13.095
down there.

00:34:13.095 --> 00:34:15.153
ASHLEY: Okay, do your shit.

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:20.047
LIAM: I need about ten minutes. In the dark, I
pull out the thread and I start doing the thing.

00:34:22.267 --> 00:34:24.642
ASHLEY: Make it a little faster than ten if you
can.

00:34:24.642 --> 00:34:27.143
LIAM: I can't do that, but I will do that.

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:30.132
MATT: Five minutes go by.

00:34:30.132 --> 00:34:34.619
SAM: I'm going to cast Message. Are you still
alive? You can reply to this message.

00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:36.805
TALIESIN: Mention that they should clean up the
bodies.

00:34:36.805 --> 00:34:44.974
SAM: Oh, yeah. While Yasha's waiting, she can
clean up the bodies. You can reply to this message.

00:34:44.975 --> 00:34:47.316
ASHLEY: I will start to move the bodies.

00:34:47.316 --> 00:34:48.665
LAURA and ASHLEY: Stealthily.

00:34:48.665 --> 00:34:50.633
LIAM: We'll say that I said that out loud to her.

00:34:50.633 --> 00:34:53.262
ASHLEY: Yes. What did you say?

00:34:53.262 --> 00:34:57.454
LIAM: Nott had a wonderful idea for you to pick up
all of the dead things.

00:34:59.734 --> 00:35:04.907
MATT: Yasha, you begin to drag the bodies back
into the central pool. They sink.

00:35:04.907 --> 00:35:06.445
ASHLEY: Flow in.

00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:16.364
MATT: All right. You complete the latter half of it.
Okay. You finish the spell, you sense the arcane,

00:35:16.408 --> 00:35:23.485
unseen net of the alarm click in, and it's prepared
and set to keep watch.

00:35:24.195 --> 00:35:26.035
LIAM: Let's get the shit out of here.

00:35:26.035 --> 00:35:27.759
LAURA: (whispering) Run away!

00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:29.028
ASHLEY: Let's go.

00:35:29.028 --> 00:35:32.330
MATT: You guys make your way back, climb back up
the rope, and make your way into the interior of

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.460
the tree, seemingly without incident.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:36.803
ASHLEY: Seemingly?

00:35:37.753 --> 00:35:40.477
LAURA: I'm going back to sleep, you guys. I need
to get my spells back.

00:35:40.477 --> 00:35:42.342
ASHLEY: I'll take the next watch since I'm awake.

00:35:42.342 --> 00:35:44.831
MATT: Yasha takes final watch. Go ahead and roll a
perception check for me.

00:35:44.831 --> 00:35:46.830
LIAM: I'm freaked out, so I'm going to stay up
with Yasha.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.948
MATT: Both of you guys make perception checks for
me, please.

00:35:52.498 --> 00:35:54.284
LIAM: Perception, 11.

00:35:54.284 --> 00:35:57.053
SAM: (singing) Run away, run away!

00:35:57.053 --> 00:35:58.260
ASHLEY: 15.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:05.823
MATT: As you guys complete the third watch for the
evening, you sense the morning come as the

00:36:05.823 --> 00:36:10.640
temperature, which previously had gotten quite
chilled, is beginning to rise a bit, though now

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.371
you can still see your breath in the air. A faint
bit of bluish light begins to appear at the outer

00:36:15.371 --> 00:36:19.515
edges of the driftwood piece that is wedged in the
doorway to make it look flush with the rest of the

00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:27.696
exterior bark. You all complete a long rest. You
have your abilities back, your hit points full,

00:36:27.696 --> 00:36:29.675
and you are ready to continue.

00:36:29.675 --> 00:36:33.365
LIAM: Could I back up one hour and ask Yasha a
quick question?

00:36:33.365 --> 00:36:34.542
MATT: Sure.

00:36:36.472 --> 00:36:40.174
LIAM: This is a small group for you, you traveled
with the circus.

00:36:41.034 --> 00:36:41.805
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:36:41.805 --> 00:36:43.224
LIAM: This is a big group for me.

00:36:43.854 --> 00:36:44.736
ASHLEY: It is?

00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:46.291
LIAM: Do you have any advice?

00:36:47.751 --> 00:36:48.876
ASHLEY: Well, I mean--

00:36:49.716 --> 00:36:52.341
LIAM: You seem awkward like me.

00:36:52.341 --> 00:36:53.374
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:36:53.374 --> 00:36:55.106
LIAM: But you made it work with a lot of people.

00:36:55.736 --> 00:37:03.264
ASHLEY: Well, if someone has a conversation with
me, I will talk to them.

00:37:07.474 --> 00:37:10.737
LIAM: I've tried that too, and it goes horribly.

00:37:12.247 --> 00:37:14.890
ASHLEY: No, I don't think it goes as bad as you
think.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.091
LIAM: I think it goes pretty bad.

00:37:17.091 --> 00:37:23.500
ASHLEY: I mean, yes, sometimes I think it's been
pretty bad even for me sometimes, watching you.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:32.773
But that doesn't mean-- there's always room for
improvement--

00:37:32.773 --> 00:37:35.077
LIAM: I'm confused, did you have advice?

00:37:36.247 --> 00:37:41.939
ASHLEY: I don't think I'm good at giving advice,
but just talk to people if they talk to you, and

00:37:41.939 --> 00:37:55.499
be nice, you know. Eat with your mouth closed,
wash your hands.

00:37:56.469 --> 00:37:58.111
LIAM: I start writing these things down.

00:37:59.941 --> 00:38:00.834
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:38:00.834 --> 00:38:05.673
ASHLEY: Wash your hair when you can, that's fine.

00:38:05.673 --> 00:38:10.493
LIAM: It just rained though. This is the cleanest
I've been in weeks.

00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:22.239
ASHLEY: (dubious noise) I feel like you're
still-- how do you stay dirty all the time?

00:38:26.499 --> 00:38:33.709
LIAM: Most of the time I'm trying to. People
don't pay attention to beggars so much.

00:38:39.894 --> 00:38:42.266
ASHLEY: So you don't want people to pay attention
to you.

00:38:43.196 --> 00:38:44.795
LIAM: Yeah, in general.

00:38:45.745 --> 00:38:58.357
ASHLEY: I get that. I feel that way, but I'm hard
to miss. I don't mean that in a, "Woo, I'm hard to miss."

00:38:59.487 --> 00:39:03.104
LIAM: You're as big as a giant barn, you are hard
to miss.

00:39:03.104 --> 00:39:07.350
ASHLEY: Yeah. Well, I--

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.946
LIAM: Do you know what I miss?

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:09.668
ASHLEY: What?

00:39:09.668 --> 00:39:10.914
LIAM: Shaving.

00:39:12.504 --> 00:39:16.156
ASHLEY: I could shave you right now with my
sword.

00:39:17.516 --> 00:39:18.286
TRAVIS: (quietly) Yes!

00:39:20.496 --> 00:39:36.312
ASHLEY: I've done it before, I like to not have
hair on my arms. This is what I do. I really think

00:39:36.312 --> 00:39:40.107
that cleanliness and hygiene is very important.

00:39:44.487 --> 00:39:52.051
LIAM: One thing that I have realized today is that
I need to work on my interpersonal skills and

00:39:52.051 --> 00:39:57.572
friendship making. So try not to cut up my face,
okay?

00:39:57.572 --> 00:40:00.244
ASHLEY: Okay, do you just want a trim? Is there a
certain look you want?

00:40:00.244 --> 00:40:05.797
LIAM: No, leave my hair on my head, but I have not
had a clean-shaven face in a long time.

00:40:05.797 --> 00:40:07.346
ASHLEY: Do you want it all gone, or you just
want--?

00:40:07.346 --> 00:40:08.579
LIAM: No, you can take it all.

00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:11.871
ASHLEY: It's easier to do that.

00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:17.137
LIAM: You can crush a person, but I'm not quite
sure how dexterous you are, so I don't want any

00:40:17.137 --> 00:40:18.166
fancy tricks.

00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:26.790
ASHLEY: I won't. I'm going to hold it like this,
and then the blade-- this is how I do it. I hold

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:31.289
it, and then I whoosh, you know?

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:32.771
LIAM: Okay.

00:40:33.751 --> 00:40:35.827
SAM: This is your five-foot greatsword?

00:40:35.827 --> 00:40:39.988
(laughter)

00:40:39.988 --> 00:40:41.656
ASHLEY: So sit here.

00:40:41.656 --> 00:40:45.023
LIAM: Should I lie on the ground?

00:40:45.023 --> 00:40:49.563
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, lie down. I've never done it like
that, but yeah, lie down.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:51.922
LIAM: Have you done this before?

00:40:51.922 --> 00:40:53.257
ASHLEY: I have done this before.

00:40:53.257 --> 00:40:53.961
LIAM: With that?

00:40:53.961 --> 00:40:58.323
ASHLEY: Not with this, something a little
smaller.

00:40:58.323 --> 00:40:59.689
LIAM: I lie on the floor.

00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:13.186
MATT: Okay. In the early dawn hours of the new
day, as the blue begins to slowly become brighter

00:41:13.186 --> 00:41:14.037
in the distance--

00:41:14.037 --> 00:41:19.454
LIAM: Wait! This means we are friends.

00:41:19.454 --> 00:41:21.972
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:41:21.972 --> 00:41:24.088
LIAM: (inhales)

00:41:24.088 --> 00:41:28.436
ASHLEY: You don't have to hold your breath because
it will take a very long time and you'll pass

00:41:28.436 --> 00:41:28.921
out.

00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:30.493
LIAM: That might be better.

00:41:30.493 --> 00:41:39.441
ASHLEY: You need to relax, breathe in, breathe
out. Okay, I got it. Here we go.

00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:47.081
MATT: I would like you to roll a dexterity check,
please. Take advantage because he's not moving.

00:41:47.081 --> 00:41:53.267
LIAM: Four globules of light rise up around you as
you begin to shave.

00:41:53.267 --> 00:41:55.932
ASHLEY: 16.

00:41:55.932 --> 00:42:07.568
MATT: Maybe it's the tensile strength of her arm
muscles, but such a large instrument seems

00:42:07.568 --> 00:42:14.591
unexpectedly delicate across the features of your
face. It's not a complete shave, there are areas

00:42:14.591 --> 00:42:22.021
that get missed because it's not a very fine
implement, but for the most part, the stubble gets

00:42:22.021 --> 00:42:27.375
closer to your face. There are a few sections that
are unevenly smooth, but it's an improvement from

00:42:27.375 --> 00:42:34.630
where it was before. It's as good a shave you can
get with a greatsword. Manages to avoid nicking

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:43.127
any major arteries, and as you complete your work,
you're proud of it, the sweat on your brow-- Caleb

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:48.236
has no idea of how it looks other than you
reaching up and touching your chin as it finishes.

00:42:48.236 --> 00:42:50.155
The rest of you come to consciousness.

00:42:50.155 --> 00:42:54.056
LAURA: Are you killing Caleb?!

00:42:54.056 --> 00:42:58.074
ASHLEY: No, I was giving him a shave.

00:42:58.074 --> 00:43:01.937
LAURA: Oh. Whoa!

00:43:01.937 --> 00:43:04.109
MARISHA: Wow.

00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:05.381
SAM: It's much better.

00:43:05.381 --> 00:43:12.067
LAURA: You have a little thing! You have a little
dimple on your chin! That's the cutest! I didn't

00:43:12.067 --> 00:43:12.495
know.

00:43:12.495 --> 00:43:13.765
TRAVIS: So boyish.

00:43:13.765 --> 00:43:16.277
MARISHA: Yeah, you almost look innocent.

00:43:16.277 --> 00:43:17.462
SAM: It looks good!

00:43:17.462 --> 00:43:23.930
LIAM: Caleb's inner monologue is: I want to
shrivel up and die.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:26.914
TRAVIS: Nice work, Yasha.

00:43:26.914 --> 00:43:32.745
ASHLEY: You know, if anyone else-- none of you--

00:43:32.745 --> 00:43:34.859
SAM: Or Jester might want a bikini.

00:43:34.859 --> 00:43:36.930
LAURA: Maybe soon, yeah.

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.457
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, I've done it before.

00:43:39.457 --> 00:43:42.342
TALIESIN: This I can confirm.

00:43:42.342 --> 00:43:48.381
LAURA: Should we gear up and head down and kill a
bunch of fish people?

00:43:48.381 --> 00:43:48.958
TRAVIS: Indeed.

00:43:48.958 --> 00:43:49.947
LAURA: All right.

00:43:49.947 --> 00:43:55.120
LIAM: I take a brief moment with the dodecahedron
before handing the bag back to Jester.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.945
LAURA: So you don't forget.

00:43:56.945 --> 00:43:58.297
LIAM: I'll forget.

00:43:58.297 --> 00:44:01.768
TRAVIS: Take the rope, we start lowering it down
there.

00:44:01.768 --> 00:44:02.538
LAURA: Stealthily.

00:44:02.538 --> 00:44:04.252
SAM: We're going down there? Again?

00:44:04.252 --> 00:44:04.745
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:44:04.745 --> 00:44:06.201
LAURA: Yeah, we're killing everything.

00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:13.598
TALIESIN: On the way down, I smack Caleb a bit on
the back and say: Well done, she likes you! And

00:44:13.598 --> 00:44:14.378
head down.

00:44:14.378 --> 00:44:17.569
LAURA: Should I cast Pass without a Trace on us
and be stealthier?

00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:20.066
TRAVIS: I think right before we go under the water
we should.

00:44:20.066 --> 00:44:21.956
SAM: Under the water?

00:44:21.956 --> 00:44:24.877
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, this is an amphibious assault.

00:44:24.877 --> 00:44:28.468
SAM: How many v's are in that word?

00:44:28.468 --> 00:44:29.886
ASHLEY: What did you say?

00:44:29.886 --> 00:44:30.967
TRAVIS: Like five.

00:44:30.967 --> 00:44:31.787
TALIESIN: Amvivious.

00:44:31.787 --> 00:44:35.559
TRAVIS: Amphibious. Yeah, there's a sea "anenome"
under there as well.

00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:40.997
SAM: I don't do well with water. I don't think I
can go down there. Why don't I stay watch?

00:44:40.997 --> 00:44:42.909
TRAVIS: Why aren't you good in water?

00:44:42.909 --> 00:44:44.972
SAM: I don't like water.

00:44:44.972 --> 00:44:47.311
TRAVIS: You can hold your breath, right?

00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:47.981
SAM: Probably.

00:44:47.981 --> 00:44:50.794
LAURA: What if I hold onto you and push you
along?

00:44:50.794 --> 00:44:52.882
TALIESIN: Are you going to be all right with Caleb
going without you?

00:44:52.882 --> 00:44:54.469
MARISHA: Remember our swimming lesson?

00:44:54.469 --> 00:44:56.237
SAM: I don't like it, though.

00:44:56.237 --> 00:45:00.093
TRAVIS: Listen, when we get down there, I'm going
to swim a rope under the water to where we're

00:45:00.093 --> 00:45:04.989
going. It's going to be like a guide line, so
whoever you ride with can pull on the rope and

00:45:04.989 --> 00:45:06.449
you'll just hang on.

00:45:06.449 --> 00:45:08.438
LIAM: It's a bad idea for you to stay. We would
need you.

00:45:08.438 --> 00:45:11.126
MATT: (chirping)

00:45:11.126 --> 00:45:13.420
LAURA: Oh Kiri.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:18.572
MATT: Pulls the knife out. (like Fjord) "It's an
amphibious assault."

00:45:18.572 --> 00:45:22.529
TRAVIS: Fuck you, Kiri.

00:45:22.529 --> 00:45:24.940
SAM: Taking the piss.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.192
LAURA: Where should we leave Kiri for this? We
can't bring her over with us.

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:31.478
SAM: I'll stay with Kiri. You guys can go, and I
can stay with Kiri.

00:45:31.526 --> 00:45:34.292
ASHLEY: I don't like that idea.

00:45:34.292 --> 00:45:36.035
LAURA: We need you, Nott.

00:45:36.035 --> 00:45:38.883
SAM: I'm not good at many things.

00:45:38.883 --> 00:45:42.314
LAURA: Yeah you are! You can shoot things. And you
can sneak around.

00:45:42.314 --> 00:45:46.812
LIAM: You're not very good at finding traps, but
everything else you're quite good at.

00:45:46.812 --> 00:45:48.439
ASHLEY: Then what are we going to do with Kiri?

00:45:48.439 --> 00:45:50.500
MARISHA: She can't go with us.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:56.640
TRAVIS: No, she can't. We could leave her in here
with you if you want, but if you see trouble

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.386
you're going to have to get in that water and come
across.

00:45:59.386 --> 00:46:00.749
SAM: (groans)

00:46:00.749 --> 00:46:01.661
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:46:01.661 --> 00:46:02.922
SAM: (groans)

00:46:02.922 --> 00:46:05.108
TRAVIS: Yep. One or the other.

00:46:05.108 --> 00:46:06.771
MATT: (like Jester) "Yes, I'm very sweet."

00:46:06.771 --> 00:46:15.489
SAM: I'll stay with Kiri, and if there's trouble,
we'll see what happens.

00:46:15.489 --> 00:46:19.949
LAURA: Kiri, you stay here with Nott, then, okay?

00:46:19.949 --> 00:46:25.655
TALIESIN: We're going to be one down, then.

00:46:25.655 --> 00:46:30.972
TRAVIS: All right, I'll take the other 50-foot
section of rope and I'll start wading into the

00:46:30.972 --> 00:46:33.628
water, and I'll take a swim back the way I went.

00:46:33.628 --> 00:46:35.363
LAURA: Wait, wait! Pass Without a Trace.

00:46:35.363 --> 00:46:37.070
TRAVIS: (high-pitched sound)

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:38.750
MATT: All right, so Pass Without a Trace.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:39.707
LAURA: Yes.

00:46:39.707 --> 00:46:41.455
TALIESIN: Is that the sound of Pass Without a
Trace?

00:46:41.455 --> 00:46:42.839
TRAVIS: It's like Aqua Velva.

00:46:42.839 --> 00:46:44.924
TALIESIN: Like Ed Wynn getting tickled.

00:46:44.924 --> 00:46:47.231
MATT: It's true.

00:46:47.231 --> 00:46:48.728
TALIESIN: Oh my!

00:46:48.728 --> 00:46:50.853
MATT: Pass Without a Trace. What's the range on
that?

00:46:50.853 --> 00:46:54.065
LAURA: 30 feet. So it's not going to to be for a
very long time. But--

00:46:54.065 --> 00:46:57.031
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:59.490
LAURA: Well it's only 30 feet in front of-- around
me.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.144
MATT: So you may want to go next.

00:47:01.144 --> 00:47:02.281
LAURA: You'll go away-- huh?

00:47:02.281 --> 00:47:03.890
MATT: You may want to go next then if you want
that to affect other people.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:04.674
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:04.674 --> 00:47:08.285
TRAVIS: Don't worry about me. I'm just swimming
over there and coming back. And then we can cast it.

00:47:08.285 --> 00:47:09.505
MATT: Okay.

00:47:09.505 --> 00:47:10.773
TRAVIS: It's a guideline.

00:47:10.773 --> 00:47:16.983
MATT: You, for the moment, wade into it and
(burbling). You guys watch as Fjord, once again,

00:47:16.983 --> 00:47:21.604
disappears beneath the surface of the water. Now
with the confidence of knowing that there is a

00:47:21.604 --> 00:47:29.457
breaking point and air ahead, that fear doesn't
creep up into your brain and you rush for it.

00:47:29.457 --> 00:47:32.725
Making your way through, make an athletics check.

00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:37.963
TRAVIS: 12.

00:47:37.963 --> 00:47:43.027
MATT: 12, okay. You manage to find it through, and
then come up quietly, just--

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:44.623
TRAVIS: Apocalypse Now.

00:47:44.623 --> 00:47:49.634
MATT: Yeah, Apocalypse Now and/or The Descent. You
slowly emerge from the water.

00:47:49.634 --> 00:47:55.203
LAURA: Ugh, The Descent. Now it makes me want to
swim through that little tunnel even less!

00:47:55.203 --> 00:47:56.275
MATT: Yeah!

00:47:56.275 --> 00:47:57.966
MARISHA: So Descent-y, you guys!

00:47:57.966 --> 00:48:04.779
MATT: Glancing up, your range of darkvision is 30
feet or 60 feet?

00:48:04.779 --> 00:48:05.796
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

00:48:05.796 --> 00:48:06.946
MATT: 60 feet, okay.

00:48:06.946 --> 00:48:12.642
TRAVIS: Where is that? Class features--

00:48:12.642 --> 00:48:14.153
MATT: Racial features, it should say.

00:48:14.153 --> 00:48:17.025
TRAVIS: Racial traits. Darkvision. 60 feet.

00:48:17.025 --> 00:48:20.999
MATT: 60 feet, great. That gives you enough
perspective for now as you come up and look. You

00:48:20.999 --> 00:48:27.740
can see this chamber, and you got a brief glance
at it before. Most of it is natural rock, but

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:35.419
there are elements of it that look like it was
once an old bit of mason architecture. You can see

00:48:35.419 --> 00:48:40.653
edges where there are actual stones stacked and
placed. Walls that have seemingly been partially

00:48:40.653 --> 00:48:49.635
reclaimed through the ages. You can see two large
central pillars where stalagmite and stalactite

00:48:49.635 --> 00:48:54.788
met eventually and created a structure in the
center. A large portion of the floor is submerged

00:48:54.788 --> 00:48:59.510
in water, and you see different paths and avenues
of it that curve off and vanish. Probably openings

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:07.421
to other tunnels beneath. The pool you're in right
there, looking up you can see there's that weird

00:49:07.421 --> 00:49:17.342
set of natural stairs that step up in front. You
can see four of these merrow creatures, two of

00:49:17.342 --> 00:49:21.956
which are in a conversation off to the left, two
that are currently rummaging through what looks to

00:49:21.956 --> 00:49:28.064
be piles of things that have been pulled up and
placed toward the top of the stair. You can hear the

00:49:28.112 --> 00:49:34.129
clinking of metal and things falling and tumbling
down the stairs. You see a fifth figure that's at

00:49:34.129 --> 00:49:38.723
the outskirts of your visual range that's
currently faced away and looking at whatever's on

00:49:38.723 --> 00:49:44.321
the other side of that upward pillar. But nobody
else seems to have noticed you emerging at this

00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:47.016
point. You haven't made any shifting or movement.

00:49:47.016 --> 00:49:51.896
TRAVIS: Do they have an eyeline on me if they
were to look over this way? Could they see my head

00:49:51.896 --> 00:49:53.407
above the water?

00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:57.920
MATT: It's possible if they were looking carefully
for you. You don't know how far their darkvision

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.084
extends.

00:49:59.084 --> 00:50:06.443
TRAVIS: Can I wade forward and look for any stones
or pillars that I might be able to throw the rope

00:50:06.443 --> 00:50:08.577
around and tie a knot on?

00:50:08.577 --> 00:50:12.942
MATT: Looking around you can see there are small
mounds of various minerals that have long dripped

00:50:12.942 --> 00:50:17.182
from the ceiling from condensation and various
water flows that have come through this interior

00:50:17.182 --> 00:50:24.708
cavern and built this hard, rocky platform that's
emerging just outside of where the pool ends. So

00:50:24.708 --> 00:50:32.161
you can bring the rope around and affix it to
that. Make a stealth check as you do so, please.

00:50:32.161 --> 00:50:35.342
TRAVIS: That's a two.

00:50:35.342 --> 00:50:37.848
SAM: Pass Without a Trace.

00:50:37.848 --> 00:50:42.718
LAURA: Well no. He didn't take it. More than 30
feet away from me, right? He's more than 30 feet

00:50:42.718 --> 00:50:43.855
away from me.

00:50:43.855 --> 00:50:45.156
MATT: He is, yes.

00:50:45.156 --> 00:50:50.051
LAURA: I should have given him Blessing of the
Trickster. Oh no!

00:50:50.051 --> 00:50:52.986
TRAVIS: Yep! That's amazing.

00:50:52.986 --> 00:51:10.302
MATT: That's a natural one. You lucky son of a
bitch! Through whatever grace your patron has

00:51:10.302 --> 00:51:12.174
granted upon you--

00:51:12.174 --> 00:51:13.375
TRAVIS: I'm in the water, man.

00:51:13.375 --> 00:51:17.647
MATT: The merrow are too distracted with whatever
they are in the process of doing to notice you

00:51:17.647 --> 00:51:26.458
slip and hit an elbow, send a pebble falling. You
get low and finish tying it off. They don't notice.

00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:31.239
TRAVIS: Okay, great. I'll give it a gentle tug. Does
it seem like the structure moves at all?

00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:33.181
MATT: No. It seems pretty solid.

00:51:33.181 --> 00:51:38.574
TRAVIS: I'll take a deep breath and I'll use it to
pull myself chest up towards the surface.

00:51:38.574 --> 00:51:44.250
MATT: Easy enough. So after a few moments, Fjord
emerges back where you guys are waiting.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.578
LAURA: Hey, you made it!

00:51:46.578 --> 00:51:53.314
TRAVIS: Yeah. Still five of them. I tied it off.
Everybody should be able to pull their way across

00:51:53.314 --> 00:51:57.442
no problem. But we got to be ready to rock when we
get in there. They're a little distracted.

00:51:57.442 --> 00:52:02.050
MARISHA: Are we going to try and wait in the water
and ambush as we go?

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:03.292
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:52:03.292 --> 00:52:04.331
MARISHA: Okay.

00:52:04.331 --> 00:52:06.800
TRAVIS: Or distract away from us and then go.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.193
MARISHA: Okay.

00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:15.381
TRAVIS: Or if we want we could cause a commotion
and have them come through the water at us and use

00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:16.949
the hole as a funnel.

00:52:16.949 --> 00:52:18.989
MARISHA: As a funnel? Might not be a bad idea.

00:52:18.989 --> 00:52:21.650
TRAVIS: Thoughts?

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:27.189
LAURA: That might be smarter, and then you could
fight with us, Nott, for a while at least.

00:52:27.189 --> 00:52:30.301
SAM: I mean, I don't like fighting, but sure.

00:52:30.301 --> 00:52:32.310
LAURA: You're so good at it, Nott!

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.292
ASHLEY: Someone's going to have to go make a
distraction and then make it back.

00:52:35.292 --> 00:52:38.563
MARISHA: And I bet those things are pretty good
swimmers.

00:52:38.563 --> 00:52:41.709
TALIESIN: Super fast in the water. I bet they're
really fast in the water.

00:52:41.709 --> 00:52:45.495
SAM: We could tie the rope-- oh, we can't tie the
rope to you, because now it's tied on the other side.

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.065
TRAVIS: I'm a very fast swimmer.

00:52:47.065 --> 00:52:50.519
MARISHA: But faster than fish?

00:52:50.519 --> 00:52:55.759
TRAVIS: I think it's 60 feet, actually, is my
swimming speed with this damn Mariner's armor.

00:52:55.759 --> 00:52:58.478
Ignore what I said.

00:52:58.478 --> 00:53:00.505
LAURA: Your regular swimming speed.

00:53:00.505 --> 00:53:01.842
TRAVIS: Regular speed, yeah.

00:53:01.842 --> 00:53:03.595
(laughter)

00:53:03.595 --> 00:53:05.049
MATT: Your swim speed is half your movement.

00:53:05.049 --> 00:53:06.721
TRAVIS: Well then yeah, it's 30 feet.

00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:08.034
MATT: 15 feet.

00:53:08.034 --> 00:53:09.823
TRAVIS: Well with it, it's my normal walking
speed.

00:53:09.823 --> 00:53:11.422
MATT: Oh right, with that it is, yes.

00:53:11.422 --> 00:53:13.486
SAM: So you're a fast swimmer.

00:53:13.486 --> 00:53:14.552
LAURA: So yeah, that's pretty good.

00:53:14.552 --> 00:53:16.143
TALIESIN: But probably not as fast as they are.

00:53:16.143 --> 00:53:23.901
TRAVIS: Nah, could I guesstimate how far it was
from entrance to portal? Where the rope is?

00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:29.553
MATT: From where you are to the-- make a survival
check.

00:53:29.553 --> 00:53:32.145
TRAVIS: 13.

00:53:32.145 --> 00:53:36.261
MATT: 13. Best you could estimate, it's close to
40 or so feet.

00:53:36.261 --> 00:53:38.073
LIAM: How long has he been gone for?

00:53:38.073 --> 00:53:39.493
TRAVIS: I'm back.

00:53:39.493 --> 00:53:40.470
MATT: He's back.

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:41.967
LIAM: Oh, you're in here talking about what was
there.

00:53:41.967 --> 00:53:45.357
LAURA: What if we just made a lot of noise in
here?

00:53:45.357 --> 00:53:53.318
TALIESIN: I'm of the opinion that the problem with
this bottleneck is we don't know what they are

00:53:53.318 --> 00:53:56.716
doing on the other side. It would be easier to
assess what's coming and make sure that they

00:53:56.716 --> 00:54:02.223
can't-- if we take care of everything there, then
we can assess what's there and they can't prepare

00:54:02.223 --> 00:54:04.637
or get more together. Have time to--

00:54:04.637 --> 00:54:06.005
TRAVIS: So you want to head over there?

00:54:06.005 --> 00:54:07.046
TALIESIN: I feel like over there is the way to
go.

00:54:07.046 --> 00:54:10.477
TRAVIS: Okay. I see the validity in that
argument.

00:54:10.477 --> 00:54:12.424
LAURA: I'll get in the water.

00:54:12.424 --> 00:54:14.439
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace first?

00:54:14.439 --> 00:54:15.652
LAURA: Well yeah!

00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:16.923
TRAVIS: Okay!

00:54:16.923 --> 00:54:18.362
TALIESIN: We'll stay together in a group.

00:54:18.362 --> 00:54:20.956
LAURA: How long did you have to hold your breath
for, Fjord?

00:54:20.956 --> 00:54:26.395
TRAVIS: I don't know. About 45, 50 seconds.

00:54:26.395 --> 00:54:29.911
LAURA: Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Pass Without a
Trace.

00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:34.194
MATT: Coming back on the rope, it's a lot easier.
Your first dive down took a while to feel your way through.

00:54:34.194 --> 00:54:38.974
LIAM: I was distracted. I was thinking about my
books. I don't want them to get harmed. Your bag

00:54:38.974 --> 00:54:40.935
is probably water resistant, yeah?

00:54:40.935 --> 00:54:46.847
LAURA: I don't know, but we can try it. Give me
your books, Caleb. Give me the books.

00:54:46.847 --> 00:54:48.182
ASHLEY: Do you want to leave them with Nott?

00:54:48.182 --> 00:54:50.985
LIAM: I do want to leave them with Nott. I'm going
to unharness the--

00:54:50.985 --> 00:54:52.937
SAM: Can you still cast spells?

00:54:52.937 --> 00:54:53.842
LIAM: Yeah.

00:54:53.842 --> 00:54:55.047
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:54:55.047 --> 00:54:58.463
TALIESIN: I'll leave my coat here. I'm not
dragging that into the water.

00:54:58.463 --> 00:55:03.304
LIAM: If you come after us, would you please hide
them under a stone or something?

00:55:03.304 --> 00:55:04.415
SAM: Sure.

00:55:04.415 --> 00:55:06.261
TRAVIS: How many books you got there?

00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:07.424
LIAM: Two.

00:55:07.424 --> 00:55:16.870
TALIESIN: That's a very nice sling thing. It'd be
a shame if anything happened to it. Are you sure

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:18.055
you're not coming?

00:55:18.055 --> 00:55:21.815
SAM: My duty is to take care of Kiri. Right?

00:55:21.815 --> 00:55:24.101
MATT: (chirping)

00:55:24.101 --> 00:55:26.928
TRAVIS: Shall we, Pass Without a Trace?

00:55:26.928 --> 00:55:28.304
LAURA: I did it already!

00:55:28.454 --> 00:55:29.593
TRAVIS: Shit balls ass! Let's do it.

00:55:29.593 --> 00:55:30.967
LAURA: Lasts for an hour, though, so it's okay.

00:55:30.967 --> 00:55:34.933
MATT: Kiri leans into you. "This means we are
friends."

00:55:34.933 --> 00:55:36.450
LAURA: She heard!

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:38.156
MATT: She woke up early.

00:55:38.156 --> 00:55:45.202
SAM: Sounds like Caleb. Wow.

00:55:45.202 --> 00:55:47.869
ASHLEY: Wait, that was-- okay.

00:55:47.869 --> 00:55:50.035
MARISHA: She's going to rattle off some secrets.

00:55:50.035 --> 00:55:57.615
TRAVIS: Kiri's got to die. Thousands of artists
are like (gasping).

00:55:57.615 --> 00:56:01.781
LAURA: Who's first? Are you going back through
first?

00:56:01.781 --> 00:56:02.819
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go first.

00:56:02.819 --> 00:56:06.084
LAURA: Okay. I'll go second. People should follow
quickly behind me because you've got to stay

00:56:06.084 --> 00:56:07.485
within 30 feet of me.

00:56:07.485 --> 00:56:13.853
TALIESIN: One quick attack, or do we try and take
them out quietly? I assume-- well, we'll take a

00:56:13.853 --> 00:56:15.198
look at what it is.

00:56:15.198 --> 00:56:16.562
TRAVIS: Distract and attack.

00:56:16.562 --> 00:56:20.693
LAURA: So we're doing the distract? But then they
know somebody's there! If we just come out of the

00:56:20.693 --> 00:56:22.807
water and attack, we get a sneak attack.

00:56:22.807 --> 00:56:24.293
TRAVIS: If they don't see us.

00:56:24.293 --> 00:56:26.899
TALIESIN: If they don't see us, then we get the
sneak attack. And if they do--

00:56:26.899 --> 00:56:28.088
LAURA: Just go for it!

00:56:28.088 --> 00:56:29.523
TALIESIN: We'll see what we see.

00:56:29.523 --> 00:56:33.517
TRAVIS: As I go in the water, I'm going to go about
halfway and then stop and tread and make sure that

00:56:33.591 --> 00:56:35.253
everybody gets along the rope fine.

00:56:35.253 --> 00:56:39.583
MATT: Okay, all right. You're casting Pass Without
a Trace first? All right. You finish casting the

00:56:39.583 --> 00:56:43.699
spell. The shadows, already super dark in here
with almost no light source beyond what Caleb's

00:56:43.699 --> 00:56:48.470
providing, they coalesce around you and the rest
of the members of the team as you all dive into

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:50.271
the pool of water. It's black.

00:56:50.271 --> 00:56:52.819
LAURA: Caleb, Blessing of the Trickster on the way
through.

00:56:52.819 --> 00:56:56.926
MATT: To Caleb? Okay. Blessing of the Trickster on
you, that's advantage on your stealth checks.

00:56:56.926 --> 00:57:04.054
I need everybody, including Fjord, to roll a
stealth check, please. Plus ten to your stealth score.

00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:07.220
MARISHA: Natural 20!

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:10.214
MATT: They rolled really high.

00:57:10.214 --> 00:57:11.387
TALIESIN: 16.

00:57:11.387 --> 00:57:17.138
TRAVIS: Thank god for that Pass Without a Trace. 19.

00:57:17.138 --> 00:57:18.499
MARISHA: 37.

00:57:18.499 --> 00:57:20.132
SAM: Jesus!

00:57:20.132 --> 00:57:22.884
LIAM: Yeah, girl! Yeah!

00:57:22.884 --> 00:57:28.286
MATT: That's some Vax numbers right there!

00:57:28.286 --> 00:57:30.096
LIAM: Zweiundzwanzig. 22.

00:57:30.096 --> 00:57:35.096
LAURA: Oh, 16. Oh, no! 18!

00:57:35.096 --> 00:57:37.970
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: 16.

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:40.444
LIAM: Yeah. That's good, Ashley.

00:57:40.444 --> 00:57:44.162
MARISHA: I am one with the water.

00:57:44.162 --> 00:57:51.644
MATT: You guys all quickly emerge from the water
below, your eyes focusing. There is no light

00:57:51.644 --> 00:57:59.238
source in this chamber. So for those of you-- you
have your darkvision on. You guys all have

00:57:59.238 --> 00:58:03.291
darkvision, I am pretty sure, except for you,
Caleb. So you're relying on the rest of them to

00:58:03.291 --> 00:58:05.006
give any sort of presence--

00:58:05.006 --> 00:58:06.464
LIAM: Listening to their footfalls.

00:58:06.464 --> 00:58:07.774
MATT: Yeah, so.

00:58:07.774 --> 00:58:10.535
TALIESIN: I am so excited.

00:58:10.622 --> 00:58:15.891
LIAM: So pretty!

00:58:15.891 --> 00:58:17.999
LAURA: Wow! Where are we?

00:58:17.999 --> 00:58:19.649
ASHLEY: Wow wowie wow!

00:58:19.649 --> 00:58:24.216
SAM: What is happening? Why is there a remote
control?

00:58:24.216 --> 00:58:27.396
LAURA: Oh, he's putting water effects on it! Shut
up!

00:58:27.396 --> 00:58:29.135
SAM: Ooh, it just got blue!

00:58:29.135 --> 00:58:31.053
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

00:58:31.053 --> 00:58:35.373
MATT: I would need you guys to place yourselves
amongst this pool.

00:58:35.373 --> 00:58:37.355
MARISHA: There it goes!

00:58:37.355 --> 00:58:39.302
LIAM: Here comes the smoke!

00:58:39.302 --> 00:58:43.274
TRAVIS: Oh shit, we got smoke!

00:58:43.274 --> 00:58:46.444
LAURA: We've never had smoke before!

00:58:46.444 --> 00:58:52.241
TALIESIN: I didn't think I'd enjoy this quite so
soon.

00:58:52.241 --> 00:58:59.809
MATT: Kiri and Nott exist on the outskirts.

00:58:59.809 --> 00:59:02.880
ASHLEY: This is Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons!

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:13.984
MATT: As you guys glance up, the first thing you
see is there is one merrow right there who's

00:59:13.984 --> 00:59:16.478
currently talking and discussing with one right
here.

00:59:16.478 --> 00:59:18.960
LIAM: This is wrong. This is right.

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.796
MATT: Place yourselves where you want to be.

00:59:20.796 --> 00:59:23.677
LIAM: That's still wrong, that's right.

00:59:23.677 --> 00:59:30.113
MATT: There's one at the base of this, right
there. Up at the top, facing away, is the one that

00:59:30.113 --> 00:59:32.597
you had seen at the top of the stairs, Fjord.

00:59:32.597 --> 00:59:35.943
TRAVIS: That's the one that was distracted.

00:59:35.943 --> 00:59:52.999
MATT: As you guys all emerge headfirst from the
water, everybody gets a surprise round except for

00:59:52.999 --> 00:59:59.085
Yasha and Molly, unfortunately. You two did not
roll high enough to beat the stealth.

00:59:59.085 --> 01:00:01.395
TRAVIS: They rolled really high.

01:00:01.395 --> 01:00:08.985
MATT: They rolled pretty high. Everyone roll
initiative, but you guys will be out of this round.

01:00:08.985 --> 01:00:13.492
LIAM: Don't fuck me, Colville. You fucked me,
Colville.

01:00:13.492 --> 01:00:25.350
TALIESIN: Do we want to try and do a clockwise
attack? Knock them out as we go?

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:29.471
LAURA: Should we try to do a distraction?

01:00:29.471 --> 01:00:33.865
MATT: 25 to 20?

01:00:33.865 --> 01:00:36.081
ASHLEY: 21.

01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:37.941
TRAVIS: Yo, what's up?

01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:40.165
ASHLEY: Might be a first.

01:00:40.165 --> 01:00:43.069
MATT: I know. 20 to 15?

01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:45.454
TRAVIS: 20 to 15?

01:00:45.454 --> 01:00:46.842
LAURA: Oh Jesus.

01:00:46.842 --> 01:00:48.803
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. Oh shit.

01:00:48.803 --> 01:00:52.323
LAURA: Oh no.

01:00:52.323 --> 01:00:55.310
MATT: 15 to ten?

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:56.689
MARISHA: 12.

01:00:56.689 --> 01:00:58.976
TRAVIS: What? Oh my god, you guys.

01:00:58.976 --> 01:01:04.168
SAM: Oh no. Single digits and 21.

01:01:04.168 --> 01:01:06.734
ASHLEY: That's a first.

01:01:06.734 --> 01:01:08.268
MATT: Ten to five?

01:01:08.268 --> 01:01:09.073
TALIESIN: Seven.

01:01:09.073 --> 01:01:09.992
LAURA: Eight.

01:01:09.992 --> 01:01:10.953
LIAM: Sechs.

01:01:10.953 --> 01:01:12.124
MATT: Okay, hold on.

01:01:12.124 --> 01:01:13.192
TRAVIS: Jester.

01:01:13.192 --> 01:01:14.323
TALIESIN: Molly, Caleb.

01:01:14.323 --> 01:01:15.863
TRAVIS: Caleb, Molly.

01:01:15.863 --> 01:01:17.536
SAM: What about you, Fjord?

01:01:17.536 --> 01:01:19.315
TRAVIS: I'm a big fat three.

01:01:19.315 --> 01:01:22.132
ALL: Ooh!

01:01:22.132 --> 01:01:24.865
LAURA: Oh my lord.

01:01:24.865 --> 01:01:29.751
MATT: Nott, you're not engaging? Just for the sake
of it.

01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:31.147
SAM: One.

01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:34.458
MATT: Wow, guys.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:37.536
SAM: I have a plus four to initiative, so I guess
that's five.

01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:39.047
MATT: That's still better than Fjord.

01:01:39.047 --> 01:01:43.278
SAM: My natural one beats yours.

01:01:43.278 --> 01:01:50.900
MATT: You all emerge from it. Yasha, you would be
first, but your stealth, you did not surprise the

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:59.732
individuals from this round point. He doesn't
notice you guys, that's a seven. Beau, you're up first.

01:01:59.732 --> 01:02:06.953
MARISHA: Wow, okay. Beau's up first. Are we just
going to go for these guys? We're not going to do

01:02:06.953 --> 01:02:08.460
some sort of distraction?

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:14.110
TRAVIS: We got the surprise round, so it's fine.
This is the surprise round.

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:19.272
MATT: Now that you're getting a better view of
this, you can see a low mist is pouring down the

01:02:19.272 --> 01:02:22.041
stairs and is filling the space around them.

01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:26.220
MARISHA: This is all water, I'm assuming, in the
middle?

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.042
MATT: All of this is water, yeah.

01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:29.563
TRAVIS: Okay, good. It's acid.

01:02:29.563 --> 01:02:38.506
MARISHA: Can I move? I'm going to go for this
guy.

01:02:38.506 --> 01:02:46.064
MATT: (counting) Easy enough. You get right to
him.

01:02:46.064 --> 01:02:56.589
MARISHA: Is there a way I can jump across and try
and fight him from over here? Do I have enough?

01:02:56.589 --> 01:03:02.249
MATT: You'll splash in the water. You won't make
it all the way to the opposite side, or you may,

01:03:02.249 --> 01:03:05.877
but he'll get an attack of opportunity on you as
you dart out of his melee range.

01:03:05.877 --> 01:03:15.406
MARISHA: Okay, no. I'm going to try and do some
KGB-level shit. I'm going to do a quick kidney

01:03:15.406 --> 01:03:17.524
punch and try and go for the temple.

01:03:17.524 --> 01:03:18.802
LIAM: Krav Maga!

01:03:18.802 --> 01:03:20.620
SAM: And influence the election.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:24.637
MATT: Actually, if you wanted to jump across, I
will say because he's surprised, and he isn't

01:03:24.637 --> 01:03:30.082
aware that you're there quite yet, if you want to
leap across, make an acrobatics check, if you

01:03:30.082 --> 01:03:34.091
still wanted to try and do so. You will land in
the water. You'll be about waist-high in the

01:03:34.091 --> 01:03:35.347
water, if not more.

01:03:35.347 --> 01:03:38.119
MARISHA: No, I'll be good. This is regular
attacks, right?

01:03:38.119 --> 01:03:39.191
MATT: Correct.

01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:41.686
MARISHA: First attack. That was good. 20?

01:03:41.686 --> 01:03:43.062
MATT: 20 hits.

01:03:43.062 --> 01:03:48.357
MARISHA: Second attack. That's garbage, that's an
eight.

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:51.495
MATT: First one hits.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:04:06.691
MARISHA: Eight damage. I'm going to spend a ki and
do Flurry of Blows. Two unarmed strikes. Natural one.

01:04:06.691 --> 01:04:08.074
MATT: Nope.

01:04:08.074 --> 01:04:12.886
TRAVIS: Man, that thing does not make up its
mind.

01:04:12.886 --> 01:04:14.600
MARISHA: No, it does not. 24.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.761
MATT: 24 hits. Roll damage for that fourth
attack.

01:04:16.761 --> 01:04:28.201
MARISHA: Four damage. Wait, I rolled the wrong
one. That's much better. Ten damage. I'm going to

01:04:28.201 --> 01:04:37.725
spend another ki point and do Stunning Strike. Jab
to the ribs.

01:04:37.725 --> 01:04:44.366
MATT: Natural 17. It resists the stun, I'm sorry.
But it's doing damage to it. As you slam into it

01:04:44.366 --> 01:04:48.853
again, turns around. It looks like it's surprised
and reeling from the impact of it.

01:04:48.853 --> 01:04:52.493
MARISHA: You were supposed to go to sleep.

01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:57.585
MATT: Gills flaring angrily towards your face.
Some spittle flies out of its growling mouth. That

01:04:57.585 --> 01:04:58.722
finishes your turn, Beau?

01:04:58.722 --> 01:05:03.778
MARISHA: Yeah. It'll be awesome when that Stunning
Strike works.

01:05:03.778 --> 01:05:05.702
MATT: Jester, you're up.

01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:10.431
LAURA: I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon right
next to that one that Beau's fighting.

01:05:10.431 --> 01:05:12.908
MATT: Right here, or this side?

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:16.447
LAURA: No, in between the two of them. Yeah, right
there.

01:05:16.447 --> 01:05:17.797
MATT: Floating in the air.

01:05:17.797 --> 01:05:19.489
LAURA: At level three.

01:05:19.489 --> 01:05:22.885
MATT: Oh snap, all right. Go make your attack
roll.

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:32.518
LAURA: It's extra big, that's right. It's got more
sparkle to it. It's got more sparkly bits.

01:05:32.518 --> 01:05:34.533
TALIESIN: Marshmallow in the center.

01:05:34.533 --> 01:05:38.732
LAURA: I'm going to try to attack the one that
Beau is attacking

01:05:38.732 --> 01:05:43.679
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

01:05:43.679 --> 01:05:45.095
LAURA: That was on 20--

01:05:45.095 --> 01:05:46.587
TALIESIN: And then it was like: nope!

01:05:46.587 --> 01:05:50.652
LAURA: That is not going to hit.

01:05:50.652 --> 01:05:54.239
MATT: Nope, swings wide. However, it has apparated
and is useful in future rounds.

01:05:54.239 --> 01:05:59.865
LAURA: He already took some damage, so I'm going
to Toll the Dead on him for my action.

01:05:59.865 --> 01:06:01.486
MATT: That is a natural three.

01:06:01.486 --> 01:06:02.865
LAURA: He gets hit.

01:06:02.865 --> 01:06:04.030
SAM: Tolled.

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:07.366
LAURA, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: He got Tolled.

01:06:07.366 --> 01:06:12.366
LAURA: Jesus H. Macy. Seven points of necrotic
damage.

01:06:12.366 --> 01:06:13.904
MATT: Seven points of necrotic damage to him, got
it.

01:06:13.904 --> 01:06:15.035
SAM: That's pretty good.

01:06:15.035 --> 01:06:17.941
MATT: Not too bad. That finish your turn, Jester?
You're going to stay where you are?

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:25.453
LAURA: Yes. I'm going to get out of the water, and
I'm going to go stand next to that thing that's

01:06:25.453 --> 01:06:27.278
coming out of the ground. Yeah, that thing.

01:06:27.278 --> 01:06:28.591
SAM: The booby-looking thing.

01:06:28.591 --> 01:06:30.464
LAURA: Yeah, the booby. The big pile of
poo-looking thing.

01:06:30.464 --> 01:06:35.460
MATT: That finishes your go. Caleb, you're up.

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:41.232
LIAM: Quick question: From the fish guy up at the
top there, if that was the corner of a cube, would

01:06:41.232 --> 01:06:44.278
it reach the one down by the lollipop?

01:06:44.278 --> 01:06:45.803
MATT: How big is the cube?

01:06:45.803 --> 01:06:49.715
LIAM: 40-foot cube, excuse me, sorry. That's
probably not big enough. That's too big, right?

01:06:49.715 --> 01:06:51.021
It's too far?

01:06:51.021 --> 01:06:52.364
MARISHA: 40 feet's huge.

01:06:52.364 --> 01:06:53.642
MATT: Wait, you mean from you?

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:59.192
LIAM: If I were to hit the fish guy at the top and
make that the corner of a cube and go this way, it

01:06:59.192 --> 01:07:00.744
would probably only get two of them, right?

01:07:00.744 --> 01:07:02.016
MATT: Possibly.

01:07:02.016 --> 01:07:06.803
LIAM: Forget it. I'm going to cast Haste on
Mollymauk.

01:07:06.803 --> 01:07:11.364
LAURA: Would I have had enough movement to get
behind the big poo pile?

01:07:11.364 --> 01:07:14.705
MATT: You would.

01:07:14.705 --> 01:07:19.802
LIAM: I can't see. It's dark, I'm blind. It's the
safer bet, to aid my friend on the next turn.

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:26.735
MATT: For you, Molly. That's to signify your
Haste. Keep that in mind.

01:07:26.735 --> 01:07:33.044
LIAM: You have just been Hasted, and I am going to
move along the wall this way away from the enemies

01:07:33.044 --> 01:07:34.786
that I think I can detect.

01:07:34.786 --> 01:07:44.358
MATT: You're still in the water, thrashing, trying
to make your way to the edge. Molly, you're up,

01:07:44.358 --> 01:07:48.433
but you lose this round, because you were not part
of the surprise. You were lagging a little behind,

01:07:48.433 --> 01:07:54.679
as Yasha-- best way I can do this quickly, because
they're losing their turn as well. That brings us

01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:58.321
to-- Nott isn't even paying attention. Fjord.

01:07:58.321 --> 01:08:03.915
TRAVIS: Yep. I'll make my way towards the two on
the left side, as far as my--

01:08:03.915 --> 01:08:07.345
MATT: On the edge there?

01:08:07.345 --> 01:08:10.494
TRAVIS: Yeah. Oh damn, that's as far as I can get,
huh?

01:08:10.494 --> 01:08:12.973
MATT: No, you can go into the water if you want to
go further. You want to get up to him?

01:08:12.973 --> 01:08:14.622
TRAVIS: Yeah, melee range.

01:08:14.622 --> 01:08:22.478
MATT: You can get melee range. You're in the
water, and you're swimming in the water, but

01:08:22.478 --> 01:08:26.250
because of your armor, it doesn't reduce your
attacks, so you're not taking disadvantage on your

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:27.224
attack rolls.

01:08:27.224 --> 01:08:33.760
TRAVIS: Nice. I will use Booming Blade in a melee
strike with the Wastehunter falchion against that

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.364
fishy fuck.

01:08:35.364 --> 01:08:36.911
MATT: Fjord, take your one attack.

01:08:36.911 --> 01:08:39.703
TRAVIS: 14.

01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:41.345
MATT: 14 hits.

01:08:41.345 --> 01:08:49.887
TRAVIS: It does? Oh my god, thank you. 1d8,
because I didn't say two-handed. That's 12 points

01:08:49.887 --> 01:08:53.018
of damage, plus because it's a monstrosity?

01:08:53.018 --> 01:08:54.742
MATT: It is.

01:08:54.742 --> 01:09:01.271
TRAVIS: 12 points of damage plus four. That is a
four. 18 points of damage.

01:09:01.271 --> 01:09:03.112
MATT: 18 points of damage on that guy.

01:09:03.112 --> 01:09:05.194
TRAVIS: With Booming Blade--

01:09:05.194 --> 01:09:10.183
MATT: If he moves at all, on his next turn, he
takes an additional 2d8. Good to know.

01:09:10.183 --> 01:09:20.040
TRAVIS: Yes sir. With my bonus action, I will Hex
this guy over here.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.187
MATT: This guy there?

01:09:23.187 --> 01:09:24.357
TRAVIS: Yes sir.

01:09:24.357 --> 01:09:26.796
MATT: He's been Hexed. Does that finish your
turn?

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:27.797
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

01:09:27.797 --> 01:09:31.614
MATT: As you pull back, the energy sparks around,
and there's this weird movement in the water like

01:09:31.614 --> 01:09:35.852
it's thrashing, the booming energy keeping that
one merrow locked in place, as the other one, the

01:09:35.852 --> 01:09:38.147
Hex coalesces around its chest and holds it.

01:09:38.147 --> 01:09:39.910
TRAVIS: I'll give him disadvantage on wisdom.

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:44.850
MATT: Wisdom checks, got it. That ends top of the
round. Now Yasha, you can take your turn. The

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.889
ambush round is over.

01:09:46.889 --> 01:09:57.201
ASHLEY: I'm going to mosey on up over next to
Beau, and I would like to rage.

01:09:57.201 --> 01:09:58.565
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:09:58.565 --> 01:10:03.319
LIAM and ASHLEY: (air horn blaring)

01:10:03.319 --> 01:10:05.998
LIAM: From the cavern behind us: (muffled air horn
noises)

01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:08.623
ASHLEY: I'm going to pull out my blade and--

01:10:08.623 --> 01:10:10.523
SAM: Take the stubble off of it?

01:10:10.523 --> 01:10:23.537
ASHLEY: Take an attack. Give it a nice shave. That
is 18.

01:10:23.537 --> 01:10:24.911
MATT: 18 hits.

01:10:24.911 --> 01:10:33.759
SAM: Come on, Yasha! Come on, Yasha, plan ahead!

01:10:33.759 --> 01:10:58.938
ASHLEY: Listen, I know, I'm sorry. Where's the
ones that I really like? There it is. (counting) 19.

01:10:58.938 --> 01:11:05.701
MATT: Nice. You rush up next to Beau, cleave down
with the blade. It carves through part of its

01:11:05.701 --> 01:11:10.018
torso and it retracts and tries to pull itself
lower in the water to make itself harder to hit.

01:11:10.018 --> 01:11:12.188
What are you going to do? You have a second
attack, right?

01:11:12.188 --> 01:11:13.489
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have a second attack.

01:11:13.489 --> 01:11:14.958
MATT: Go for it.

01:11:14.958 --> 01:11:25.889
ASHLEY: That's not going to hit. Eight.

01:11:25.889 --> 01:11:35.988
MATT: Eight misses, unfortunately. Next one
swings, and a miss. Now the merrow all go

01:11:35.988 --> 01:11:38.221
together, because you guys left a big old gap of
initiative there.

01:11:38.221 --> 01:11:39.247
LAURA: Oh no.

01:11:39.247 --> 01:11:40.406
TRAVIS: It's after Yasha, right?

01:11:40.406 --> 01:11:49.405
MATT: Correct. First part, I'm going to say--
Let's make it fun.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:52.138
SAM: Yes, let's.

01:11:52.138 --> 01:12:00.146
MATT: This guy here is going to take his trident
and chuck it right towards Beau.

01:12:00.146 --> 01:12:04.742
TRAVIS: Are these free tridents, or do they also
have that cord that's attached to them?

01:12:04.742 --> 01:12:05.944
MARISHA: Like the harpoons?

01:12:05.944 --> 01:12:10.877
MATT: They have the cords still attached. That's a
17 to hit.

01:12:10.877 --> 01:12:12.558
MARISHA: 17 is my armor class.

01:12:12.558 --> 01:12:19.683
MATT: There you go. With that to there, first off,
Beau. As it strikes you in the chest, you take ten

01:12:19.683 --> 01:12:23.186
points of piercing damage, and I need you to make
a strength check for me, please.

01:12:23.186 --> 01:12:29.052
MARISHA: So good at this. Just a straight check,
or a saving throw?

01:12:29.052 --> 01:12:30.716
MATT: A strength check.

01:12:30.716 --> 01:12:37.907
MARISHA: 19-- sorry, ten. It looked like a 19
upside down.

01:12:37.907 --> 01:12:45.984
MATT: It was a 14. You get pulled through right
next to it there, in the middle of the water. As

01:12:45.984 --> 01:12:57.278
you fall to the ground, it's going to attempt to
bite at you. Since you're in the water, outside of

01:12:57.278 --> 01:13:01.422
your terrain, I will give it advantage on the
strike, because you're now thrashing water and

01:13:01.422 --> 01:13:10.978
swimming, and it's in its own terrain. That'll be
18 to hit. With the bite on you there, you take an

01:13:10.978 --> 01:13:18.710
additional eight points of piercing damage. At
that moment, this one here is going to turn around

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:27.310
onto Fjord, and is going to shift this way and
unleash both bite and claw attack against you,

01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:32.446
Fjord. 17 to hit?

01:13:32.446 --> 01:13:34.193
TRAVIS: That hits; it's my armor class.

01:13:34.193 --> 01:13:46.244
MATT: For that claw attack, it's going to be 2d4.
Seven points of piercing damage against you, Fjord.

01:13:46.244 --> 01:13:48.213
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:13:48.213 --> 01:13:55.042
SAM: Did you guys scan the area for Despacito
beasts?

01:13:55.042 --> 01:14:01.829
TRAVIS: Seven points of damage.

01:14:01.829 --> 01:14:06.488
MATT: It's going to pull back after it finishes
clawing into you. It's going to try and bite down

01:14:06.537 --> 01:14:09.666
with its jaws. That's a 19 to hit.

01:14:09.666 --> 01:14:10.918
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:14:10.918 --> 01:14:18.580
MATT: You take another seven points of piercing
damage. The one behind there, who sees its friend

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:24.560
digging into Fjord's torso and body, watches as it
finishes its round of strikes and then

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:31.893
under-handed throws its harpoon towards him.
That's another 18 to hit.

01:14:31.893 --> 01:14:32.888
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:14:32.888 --> 01:14:39.847
MATT: With that, you take ten points of piercing
damage. I need you to make a strength check. As it

01:14:39.847 --> 01:14:44.140
pierces, you grab it, and it manages to careen
into the side of your hip, and it hits bone. You

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:46.268
feel it grind against the inside with the pain.

01:14:46.268 --> 01:14:51.777
TRAVIS: That's a 17.

01:14:51.777 --> 01:14:58.441
MATT: You beat it. Rolled a 15. So you do not get
pulled. It does not give him his follow-up attack.

01:14:58.441 --> 01:15:05.383
However, he's going to move forward to get his
follow-up attack anyway with the rest of his

01:15:05.383 --> 01:15:08.974
movement, and is going to attempt to bite you, and
is going to miss. That's a nine.

01:15:08.974 --> 01:15:10.407
TRAVIS: Nein!

01:15:10.407 --> 01:15:14.073
MATT: He goes to bite and as you pull the harpoon
out, and turn back your shield you bash the side

01:15:14.073 --> 01:15:19.146
of its face and it manages to pull back. It scrapes
across its fish-like face, but no impact or

01:15:19.193 --> 01:15:27.297
damage. All right, that's going to finish his go.
The one that is right next to you, Yasha, is going

01:15:27.297 --> 01:15:32.123
to shift around, not leaving combat with you, but
going behind the pillar to give itself some cover

01:15:32.123 --> 01:15:35.595
from anybody who's out in the vicinity. It's going
to attempt to make two strikes against you.

01:15:35.595 --> 01:15:38.049
TRAVIS: I didn't-- I need to make Hex checks.

01:15:38.049 --> 01:15:39.165
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:15:39.165 --> 01:15:40.451
TRAVIS: Oh shit, how many of them? Three?

01:15:40.451 --> 01:15:41.367
MATT: Three.

01:15:41.367 --> 01:15:42.320
SAM: Ooh!

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.576
TRAVIS: At advantage because War Caster, right?

01:15:43.576 --> 01:15:44.763
MATT: Yep.

01:15:44.763 --> 01:15:45.847
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:15:45.847 --> 01:15:46.999
MATT: Roll higher than a ten.

01:15:46.999 --> 01:15:47.972
TRAVIS: What is that, constitution?

01:15:47.972 --> 01:15:48.916
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

01:15:48.916 --> 01:15:53.713
TRAVIS: Okay. That's a 15. Did 15 work?

01:15:53.713 --> 01:15:54.676
MATT: 15 works.

01:15:54.676 --> 01:16:02.891
TRAVIS: Nice. Higher than a ten, sorry. That's a
natural 19, that'll do it. And 13-- that's an 18.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.829
All three save.

01:16:04.829 --> 01:16:12.612
MATT: All righty, that's good on your end. For
you, Yasha, you didn't use Reckless last turn, right?

01:16:12.612 --> 01:16:13.710
ASHLEY: No.

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:16.966
MATT: That's a natural 20 on that first strike
with the claws at you. That is going to be 14

01:16:16.966 --> 01:16:23.423
points of piercing damage, reduced to half so you
only take seven because you're raging. And the

01:16:23.423 --> 01:16:28.994
bite attack against you is a natural two plus six.
No, that misses you with an eight. However, that

01:16:28.994 --> 01:16:33.100
finishes their round and this guy up here who now
spins around and sees the rest of you come inside

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:37.866
begins shouting out in a language you don't
understand (snarling). As it's holding up this

01:16:37.866 --> 01:16:42.001
staff that has this almost crystal spike of
natural crystal at the end of it, it begins to

01:16:42.001 --> 01:16:46.253
chant something under its breath. And as it spins
its hand in the air, you watch as the ceiling

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:52.150
above you in this chamber begins to grow into this
low cloud that spirals out, encompassing the

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:54.217
entirety of the interior of the chamber.

01:16:54.217 --> 01:16:55.260
LAURA: Run away!

01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:01.725
MATT: You see little sparks of lightning arcing
through the cloud as it spools above.

01:17:01.725 --> 01:17:03.679
MARISHA: Motherfucking druid fish.

01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:08.545
MATT: Beau, I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw, since you're the one closest to it.

01:17:08.545 --> 01:17:10.507
MARISHA: Saving throw.

01:17:10.507 --> 01:17:11.602
MATT: Correct.

01:17:11.602 --> 01:17:14.647
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

01:17:14.647 --> 01:17:22.759
MATT: You suffer 16 points of lightning damage as
you get struck by lightning in the water. Which

01:17:22.759 --> 01:17:27.930
you watch as technically now, yeah, if any of you
are in the water when the lightning hits you, you

01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:31.497
have disadvantage on your saving throw because you
are in the water. Didn't matter this time because

01:17:31.497 --> 01:17:36.375
you failed anyway, but you watch as the bolt
strikes Beau and she starts thrashing in the water

01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:39.604
as the muscles tense. There's a giant burn mark on
the side of your head.

01:17:39.604 --> 01:17:41.650
TRAVIS: Oh shit, you guys! Oh, fuck.

01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:42.933
MATT: Looking pretty rough on that one.

01:17:42.933 --> 01:17:44.131
MARISHA: I just got fucked up.

01:17:44.131 --> 01:17:49.467
MATT: And it's going to go ahead and spin itself
over to the edge this way, using the one below.

01:17:49.467 --> 01:17:54.201
Getting itself between the rest of its merrow
compatriots and you guys. That finishes their

01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:55.915
turn; Beau, you're up.

01:17:55.915 --> 01:18:05.252
MARISHA: Ah! Okay, I'm going to take the one who's
got a trident jabbed into my shoulder. I'm going

01:18:05.252 --> 01:18:10.252
to grab the chain and I'm going to yank it towards
me as I deck him in the face twice.

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:11.441
MATT: Go for it.

01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:13.671
MARISHA: The first attack--

01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:17.422
MATT: If you want to move around to get onto land,
otherwise you're going to be having a hard time in

01:18:17.422 --> 01:18:19.537
the water here attacking them because you're
constantly swimming.

01:18:19.537 --> 01:18:20.505
MARISHA: Can I do that?

01:18:20.505 --> 01:18:25.730
MATT: You still have movement, yeah. So you can
move five, ten, 15, 20, 25 there. So you manage to

01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:31.016
whip around, get out, up onto land and not end up
with a disadvantage on your attacks.

01:18:31.016 --> 01:18:32.468
MARISHA: Okay, the first one is 15?

01:18:32.468 --> 01:18:34.205
MATT: 15 does hit, yes.

01:18:34.205 --> 01:18:39.415
MARISHA: Woohoo! Okay, second attack; not as good,
12.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:44.402
MATT: 12 does not hit, unfortunately. But the
first strike, as you pull up, cracks it right in

01:18:44.402 --> 01:18:48.983
the jaw. The next one, it manages to bash your arm
out of the way and it deflects off the side-- no impact.

01:18:48.983 --> 01:18:50.646
MARISHA: Okay, that's seven damage.

01:18:50.646 --> 01:18:52.837
MATT: All righty, the first strike.

01:18:52.837 --> 01:19:06.259
MARISHA: And then I am going to take my bonus and
spend a ki point to do Patient Defense.

01:19:06.304 --> 01:19:12.553
MATT: Okay, so as you get up on land, you focus
and looking around side-to-side, make sure that

01:19:12.553 --> 01:19:14.892
you're aware of everything around you and get
ready to defend and deflect.

01:19:14.892 --> 01:19:17.800
MARISHA: A little in shock. (pants) Ah!

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.548
MATT: Okay, that finishes Beau's turn. Jester,
you're up.

01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:26.606
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use Spiritual Weapon
that I have up and try to hit that thing.

01:19:26.606 --> 01:19:28.391
MATT: Go ahead and roll the attack for that guy.

01:19:28.391 --> 01:19:31.164
LAURA: Ooh, that hits, that's a good one.

01:19:31.164 --> 01:19:33.119
MATT: Okay, all right, what was the number?

01:19:33.158 --> 01:19:34.478
LAURA: 15 plus my attack.

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:38.094
MATT: 15 is its armor class, so yeah, that's
fine. Well, 13 actually, so that definitely hits.

01:19:38.143 --> 01:19:42.592
LAURA: And then 2d8-- seven points of force damage
to him.

01:19:42.592 --> 01:19:45.349
MATT: Seven points plus your wisdom modifier.

01:19:45.349 --> 01:19:46.885
LAURA: Oh, plus four, so 11!

01:19:46.885 --> 01:19:51.106
MATT: There you go. 11 points of damage to him.
All right, how do you want to do this?

01:19:51.106 --> 01:19:53.436
(cheering)

01:19:53.436 --> 01:19:59.012
LAURA: Oh man, that feels good. I haven't got that
in a long time! I'm going to use the giant

01:19:59.012 --> 01:20:05.019
lollipop and it's going to raise really high up on
the roof and then slam down onto it as hard as it can!

01:20:05.019 --> 01:20:08.237
MATT: Yasha, as you're engaged with it, both
growling at each other, you watch as suddenly its

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.039
body crumples into the stonework.

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:14.246
ASHLEY: I scream out, yeah, Jester!

01:20:14.246 --> 01:20:17.458
MATT: It slips into the water and vanishes beneath
the waves.

01:20:17.458 --> 01:20:20.012
ASHLEY: I flip it off.

01:20:20.012 --> 01:20:22.278
MATT: So that's your bonus action. You still have
your movement and action.

01:20:22.278 --> 01:20:25.520
LAURA: I'm also going to move it closer to the one
next to Beau.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.528
MATT: Right there?

01:20:26.528 --> 01:20:27.730
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:28.784
MATT: All righty.

01:20:28.784 --> 01:20:36.718
LAURA: And then I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at--
Should I do that? Or should I do Toll the Dead on him?

01:20:36.718 --> 01:20:39.770
MATT: Cure Wounds is touch, so you have to be
right next to him.

01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:42.850
LAURA: Just kidding! I'm going to Toll the Dead on
the one that Beau's fighting.

01:20:42.850 --> 01:20:44.445
MATT: Okay, what's the range on that?

01:20:44.445 --> 01:20:48.240
LAURA: Okay, hold on.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.369
TALIESIN and SAM: That's a lot of spells.

01:20:50.369 --> 01:20:51.623
LAURA: Yeah, well, you know.

01:20:51.623 --> 01:20:52.817
MATT: Caleb, you're up next so be ready.

01:20:52.817 --> 01:20:53.736
LIAM: What's the lighting like in here?

01:20:53.736 --> 01:20:55.912
MATT: Right now? None, there is no light.

01:20:55.912 --> 01:20:57.076
LAURA: 60 feet.

01:20:57.076 --> 01:20:58.812
MATT: 60 feet? All right, yeah, so you can do it
from there if you want.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:01.638
LAURA: Okay, cool. It's a wisdom save and he's
Hexed on wisdom.

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.510
MATT: Natural 20.

01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:05.320
TRAVIS and LAURA: Disadvantage?

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:09.162
MATT: No, that's disadvantage on wisdom checks,
not wisdom saving throws. Hex doesn't affect

01:21:09.162 --> 01:21:10.309
saving throws.

01:21:10.309 --> 01:21:12.971
TRAVIS: I am sorry. I did not understand that
part.

01:21:12.971 --> 01:21:18.757
MATT: Yeah, but, for instance, if you had said
strength checks, then every time it tries to pull

01:21:18.757 --> 01:21:22.380
somebody, it would have disadvantage on that.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.541
LAURA: Oh, that would have been better, then, huh?

01:21:23.541 --> 01:21:25.265
TRAVIS: The lesson in the lesson.

01:21:25.265 --> 01:21:26.626
MATT: But now you know, going forward with Hex.

01:21:26.626 --> 01:21:28.957
SAM: If we survive this.

01:21:28.957 --> 01:21:30.525
TRAVIS: Well, fuck me sideways.

01:21:30.525 --> 01:21:31.844
TALIESIN: I feel your pain.

01:21:31.844 --> 01:21:35.776
LAURA: Yay, that's pretty much all I can do.

01:21:35.776 --> 01:21:36.968
MATT: Going to stay where you are?

01:21:36.968 --> 01:21:38.100
LAURA: Yeah.

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:40.045
MATT: All right, that finishes Jester's turn.
Caleb, you're up.

01:21:40.045 --> 01:21:46.450
LIAM: I cannot see anything. I'm going to move
towards the sound of Jester shouting in the dark

01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:53.716
and I'm going to raise up the Glove of Blasting
and try to shoot the fish-man that I heard way up

01:21:53.716 --> 01:21:56.581
high ahead of me, up the hill. They'll all be at
disadvantage.

01:21:56.581 --> 01:21:58.945
MATT: The one that's attacking Beau, or the one at
the very top?

01:21:58.945 --> 01:22:00.241
LIAM: The one with the staff at the top.

01:22:00.241 --> 01:22:01.845
MATT: All right, go for it. Disadvantage on all
the attacks.

01:22:01.845 --> 01:22:08.884
TRAVIS: We get like, little strobes from the
lightning. It's like that opening sequence in Blade.

01:22:08.884 --> 01:22:15.263
LIAM: First one's 15.

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:16.805
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

01:22:16.805 --> 01:22:21.433
LIAM: Second one is 14.

01:22:21.433 --> 01:22:22.647
MATT: 14 misses.

01:22:22.647 --> 01:22:28.099
LIAM: And then that is also 14, so just one of
them hits.

01:22:28.099 --> 01:22:30.851
MATT: So, one of them hits. The two other ones
careen off and you watch as they streak out into

01:22:30.851 --> 01:22:36.678
the darkness past this merrow, what looks to be a
priest-like entity up there that's commanding the

01:22:36.678 --> 01:22:44.406
storm. Exploding on the rocks behind it, one
hitting this piece of long-lingering temple-like

01:22:44.406 --> 01:22:48.191
interior. And one finally strikes it in the chest.
Go ahead and roll damage on that one.

01:22:48.191 --> 01:22:53.376
LIAM: That is six points of fire damage.

01:22:53.376 --> 01:23:01.462
MATT: It does make a concentration check. Natural
17 plus two. It does succeed in maintaining

01:23:01.462 --> 01:23:02.403
concentration.

01:23:02.403 --> 01:23:03.686
LIAM: Okay, that's it.

01:23:03.686 --> 01:23:06.187
MATT: That's your turn. Caleb's done. Molly,
you're up.

01:23:06.187 --> 01:23:07.583
SAM: Yeah, Hasty.

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:11.428
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to run, I'm going to use
my bonus action to activate one of my swords.

01:23:11.428 --> 01:23:13.846
MATT: The other one? Or do you still have the one
activated from before?

01:23:13.846 --> 01:23:18.873
TALIESIN: Technically, that would have still been
activated, so shit, that's right. Yeah, I'm going

01:23:18.873 --> 01:23:23.254
to use my bonus action to activate the other one,
too. I'm going to see if I can make it to that

01:23:23.254 --> 01:23:24.874
little hill over there.

01:23:24.874 --> 01:23:26.395
MATT: Which one? Here?

01:23:26.395 --> 01:23:27.985
TALIESIN: I'm going to attack the one that's right
in front of Fjord.

01:23:27.985 --> 01:23:29.053
LIAM: Double speed.

01:23:29.053 --> 01:23:34.665
MATT: Okay, that will put you right there. So you
rush up to the edge there. You used your bonus

01:23:34.665 --> 01:23:37.054
action, you have your two attacks and your hasted
attack.

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:47.668
TALIESIN: Yes, so I'm going to do two attacks plus
a hasted attack. That's 17. That hits, one does

01:23:47.668 --> 01:23:52.717
not, and then my third attack is a 16 that also
hits.

01:23:52.717 --> 01:23:54.469
MATT: So two attacks. Go ahead and roll damage on
that.

01:23:54.469 --> 01:23:55.706
SAM: Wow!

01:23:55.706 --> 01:24:02.765
TALIESIN: That's eight points of damage.

01:24:02.765 --> 01:24:04.769
MATT: Eight points of damage, nice.

01:24:04.769 --> 01:24:07.824
TALIESIN: And nine points of damage.

01:24:07.824 --> 01:24:12.847
MATT: All righty. You're using the d6's for
your--

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:14.098
TALIESIN: I am using the d6's.

01:24:14.098 --> 01:24:18.525
MATT: Cool, so as you rush up, you swing the
scimitars in this blast of speed. Two of them

01:24:18.525 --> 01:24:22.025
manage to strike true to its body, cutting out a
piece of it. It's looking pretty hurt now,

01:24:22.025 --> 01:24:25.427
starting to bleed out where the wounds are hit.
But it's growling in your face as it spins around.

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:30.829
Its fins curl up from the side and you can smell
this awful, swampy, almost sulfurous smell from

01:24:30.829 --> 01:24:33.647
its breath in your face. Is that your turn?

01:24:33.647 --> 01:24:35.043
TALIESIN: That's the end of my turn.

01:24:35.043 --> 01:24:36.539
SAM and LAURA: Two attacks?

01:24:36.539 --> 01:24:38.048
TALIESIN: That was three attacks, one missed.

01:24:38.048 --> 01:24:39.177
LAURA: Oh.

01:24:39.177 --> 01:24:42.004
MATT: All right, that brings us to Nott, who is
waiting patiently with Kiri.

01:24:42.004 --> 01:24:47.353
SAM: I'll send a Message to Caleb. Are you guys
alive and do you need anything? You can reply to

01:24:47.353 --> 01:24:48.847
this message.

01:24:48.847 --> 01:24:50.306
LIAM: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck!

01:24:50.306 --> 01:24:51.313
SAM: Uh-oh.

01:24:51.313 --> 01:24:55.281
MATT: Is that your turn?

01:24:55.281 --> 01:24:56.567
SAM: That's it.

01:24:56.567 --> 01:24:57.834
LAURA: You didn't move at all?

01:24:57.834 --> 01:24:59.137
SAM: I'm going to think about it.

01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:00.306
MATT: That brings us to Fjord.

01:25:00.306 --> 01:25:03.774
TRAVIS: After getting so fucked up that last
round-- the scratch, the bite, and the trident in

01:25:03.774 --> 01:25:09.956
the gut-- I'll put both hands on the falchion and
say, Do not see me, and I'll cast Blink.

01:25:09.998 --> 01:25:11.214
MARISHA: (gasps)

01:25:11.214 --> 01:25:12.073
MATT: Okay!

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.836
ALL: Ooh!

01:25:13.836 --> 01:25:15.098
MATT: And Blink is not concentration, correct?

01:25:15.098 --> 01:25:16.167
TRAVIS: It is not.

01:25:16.167 --> 01:25:23.809
MATT: Yes, all right. So with that, Fjord vanishes
from the battlefield. We'll use this as a spatial

01:25:23.809 --> 01:25:26.333
positioning device of where you were before.

01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:28.825
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

01:25:28.825 --> 01:25:33.465
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. That brings it to
the top of the round. Yasha, you're up.

01:25:33.465 --> 01:25:35.112
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:25:35.112 --> 01:25:40.667
MATT: Fjord vanished. You see two now turning
their eyes towards Mollymauk who's right there.

01:25:40.667 --> 01:25:45.226
There's one across the way that's currently
barrelling on Beau and there's the one at the top

01:25:45.226 --> 01:25:47.425
of the stairs right now that looks like it's
commanding a giant storm.

01:25:47.425 --> 01:25:50.586
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over to the one by Beau.

01:25:50.586 --> 01:25:51.802
MATT: Over here?

01:25:51.802 --> 01:25:52.786
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:25:52.786 --> 01:25:59.375
MATT: So that's five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 35. You're
in the water swimming, so your attacks are at

01:25:59.375 --> 01:26:00.763
disadvantage right now.

01:26:00.763 --> 01:26:05.087
ASHLEY: Okay. All right.

01:26:05.087 --> 01:26:12.691
MATT: If you wanted to do Reckless, you could
counteract that, but you'll be taking--

01:26:12.691 --> 01:26:26.103
ASHLEY: Well, I had one natural 20, and then 18
was my lowest.

01:26:26.103 --> 01:26:28.102
MATT: Wait, so that was disadvantage?

01:26:28.102 --> 01:26:30.685
TALIESIN: She rolled a natural 20 for her other
roll.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.247
MATT: Got you, so the first attack was what?

01:26:32.247 --> 01:26:34.163
ASHLEY: 12 plus six.

01:26:34.163 --> 01:26:37.752
MATT: That hits. So your first attack hits. Go
ahead and roll damage on that.

01:26:37.752 --> 01:26:50.484
ASHLEY: Okay, same as last time. 19 points of
damage.

01:26:50.484 --> 01:26:55.357
MATT: 19 points of damage, nice! All right, and
you have your second attack, with disadvantage.

01:26:55.357 --> 01:27:02.474
ASHLEY: 15.

01:27:02.474 --> 01:27:05.553
MATT: 15 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.597
TALIESIN: Murder it.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:12.267
ASHLEY: 15 points of damage.

01:27:12.267 --> 01:27:17.250
MATT: This is-- you only do five additional damage
on this one. Right? So 15?

01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:18.617
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:27:18.617 --> 01:27:24.839
MATT: Damn, nice roll! As you, in the water,
cleave out once with the blade in this giant

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:30.188
splash arc of water from the middle of the pool in
the center, it carves across the side of its back.

01:27:30.188 --> 01:27:34.604
(snarling) It turns around towards you right as
you bring the second strike up into its abdomen.

01:27:34.604 --> 01:27:39.192
It pushes off the blade and it looks pretty hurt.
It's bleeding out of its wounds in the middle of

01:27:39.192 --> 01:27:42.350
its stomach and its back. That finishes your
turn?

01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:48.235
ASHLEY: Do I have a-- no, never mind, that's not a
bonus action. Never mind, sorry. Was going to try

01:27:48.235 --> 01:27:49.459
Healing Hands.

01:27:49.459 --> 01:27:56.500
MATT: That ends your turn. It's their turn. So, I
will need you, first off, to make a dexterity

01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:01.031
saving throw. As you come up and carve into the
back of it, the one on top hisses and directs its

01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:04.316
finger down towards you as a bolt of lightning
arcs out of the--

01:28:04.316 --> 01:28:10.508
ASHLEY: Ten.

01:28:10.508 --> 01:28:12.226
TALIESIN: Wait, no, it's a saving throw, right?

01:28:12.226 --> 01:28:13.510
MATT: Yeah, saving throw. Plus?

01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:16.821
TALIESIN: Oh, it's a dex saving throw? Never mind,
sorry.

01:28:16.821 --> 01:28:22.069
MATT: That does not succeed. You're in the water,
so it would be disadvantage anyway.

01:28:22.069 --> 01:28:23.638
TALIESIN: That makes me sad.

01:28:23.638 --> 01:28:30.886
MATT: That is 25 points of lightning damage, which
is not halved on you because the rage doesn't

01:28:30.886 --> 01:28:38.048
affect it. It only affects slashing, piercing, and
bludgeoning. So you're blasted in the middle of

01:28:38.048 --> 01:28:41.955
the water. You sink for a moment as your muscles give
out, your sword almost falls out of your grasp,

01:28:41.955 --> 01:28:45.336
and you manage to right yourself as you're
treading water here. Your feet can't touch the

01:28:45.336 --> 01:28:51.377
bottom of this pool and your eyes go flashing
white for a second, and for an instant, you see

01:28:51.377 --> 01:28:56.100
the face of Kord the Stormlord there from the
vision your recently had. Then clarify and shake

01:28:56.100 --> 01:29:02.584
it out of your head and carry yourself back into
place. That's going to finish this guy who's going

01:29:02.584 --> 01:29:11.086
to move around. He can only move ten feet so he
goes five, ten. He's going to stop right there.

01:29:11.086 --> 01:29:13.105
SAM: She got shocked so hard we saw parts of her
dream.

01:29:13.105 --> 01:29:16.085
(laughter)

01:29:16.085 --> 01:29:23.854
MATT: This guy right here is going to go ahead
towards you, Beau, as you're right there. He has

01:29:23.854 --> 01:29:26.973
disadvantage on the attacks against you, though.
He's going to go ahead and make its claw attack

01:29:26.973 --> 01:29:34.447
against you, with disadvantage. That's cocked. You
saved yourself from a natural 20 with that one.

01:29:34.447 --> 01:29:36.930
It's a 16, which I believe misses, right?

01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:38.267
MARISHA: Misses. Just misses.

01:29:38.267 --> 01:29:42.376
MATT: So, as it claws toward you, you, being
prepared for it, dart off to the side. It's going

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.684
to go ahead and take a bite at you.

01:29:43.684 --> 01:29:44.900
MARISHA: You have such big hands.

01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:51.449
MATT: With disadvantage, another natural 20
averted! However, that does come to a 19, so I

01:29:51.449 --> 01:29:52.523
believe that does hit you.

01:29:52.523 --> 01:29:53.449
MARISHA: Ah!

01:29:53.449 --> 01:29:57.816
TRAVIS: Whoosh. Worcestershire sauce.

01:29:57.816 --> 01:30:04.999
MATT: That is 11 points of piercing damage as it
bites down onto the front of your clavicle and face.

01:30:06.849 --> 01:30:10.381
MARISHA: I'm unconscious. Again.

01:30:10.381 --> 01:30:17.469
MATT: Beau falls to the ground. As she sinks from
its jaw under the rock there, it spins around

01:30:17.524 --> 01:30:26.219
towards you, right in your face, its gills flaring
up. That's going to end its turn. The two over

01:30:26.219 --> 01:30:38.283
here, this one's going to move there and they're
both going to flank Molly. They are both going to

01:30:38.283 --> 01:30:47.623
harpoon you-- jam melee at the one on this side.
First attack is going to be an 18 to hit.

01:30:47.623 --> 01:30:48.757
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:30:48.757 --> 01:30:49.732
MATT: What's your armor class?

01:30:49.732 --> 01:30:50.621
TALIESIN: 17.

01:30:50.621 --> 01:30:51.969
MATT: Plus two because of the Haste.

01:30:51.969 --> 01:30:56.042
TALIESIN: That is with the plus two. I'm an AC of
15. I am easy target.

01:30:56.042 --> 01:31:03.551
MATT: Oh, buddy. That does hit you. So the first
harpoon strike against you-- that's eight plus

01:31:03.551 --> 01:31:10.094
four, 12 points of piercing damage. It jams you
into the abdomen from that side. The other strike--

01:31:12.524 --> 01:31:16.687
TALIESIN: The other person, I'm casting Curse of
the Eyeless on the second.

01:31:16.687 --> 01:31:20.975
MATT: This guy's finishing his round. He's
attempting to bite you, that's going to be a 15.

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.809
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

01:31:22.809 --> 01:31:26.378
MATT: As he bites down towards you, this time as
you pull the trident out you jam it up and it

01:31:26.378 --> 01:31:30.982
throws him off and clips him in the side of the
chin, breaking off one of his teeth. At that

01:31:30.982 --> 01:31:34.481
moment, the guy behind you is going to swing in
with his harpoon as well.

01:31:34.481 --> 01:31:35.645
TALIESIN: Curse of the Eyeless.

01:31:35.645 --> 01:31:36.937
MATT: Okay, reaction to that.

01:31:36.937 --> 01:31:38.838
TALIESIN: And I take my three points of damage.

01:31:38.838 --> 01:31:45.275
MATT: That's cocked. So he has a regular strike on
this one, so the attack with the harpoon is going

01:31:45.275 --> 01:31:47.928
to be a 21 to hit, unfortunately.

01:31:47.928 --> 01:31:49.276
TALIESIN: With disadvantage?

01:31:49.276 --> 01:31:52.927
MATT: Well, he had advantage because he had you
flanked, so it just made it a general roll.

01:31:52.927 --> 01:31:54.632
TALIESIN: Okay, that hits.

01:31:54.632 --> 01:32:00.880
MATT: So that is going to be ten points of
piercing damage as the other harpoon jams you in

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:05.229
the back. As you're arcing upward, it's going to
attempt to bite down at you, but its eyes have

01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:10.746
gone dark and it's just biting wild in front,
using the thrashing of your body to guide itself.

01:32:10.746 --> 01:32:15.829
That is going to be a natural seven plus six, 13.
Misses. So it bites down, you manage to duck out

01:32:15.829 --> 01:32:22.129
of the way and slam the hilt of your scimitar up
into its face and knock it off to the side. That's

01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:29.231
going to end their go. That brings us to Beau. I
need you to make a death saving throw, please.

01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:31.176
SAM: Were you saying the Curse of the Islands?

01:32:31.176 --> 01:32:33.332
TALIESIN: The Eyeless.

01:32:33.332 --> 01:32:36.930
MARISHA: Let's go cobalt blue. 17.

01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:44.275
MATT: That's one success. Mark it on your tattoo.
Jester, you're up.

01:32:44.275 --> 01:32:55.229
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to use my action to Invoke
Duplicity, and I'm going to make her appear

01:32:55.229 --> 01:33:03.278
standing right next to Yasha. But I can't use my
action to make her doing anything--

01:33:03.278 --> 01:33:04.936
MATT: It's a 30-foot range, right? So it'd be
right there.

01:33:04.936 --> 01:33:08.782
LAURA: Okay. And then I'm going to use my bonus
action--

01:33:08.782 --> 01:33:10.371
MATT: She's gliding on the water, tiptoe.

01:33:10.371 --> 01:33:20.317
LAURA: Yeah. Healing Word at level two on Beau. I
know that's lame, but it's something. Oh that's

01:33:20.317 --> 01:33:23.435
good, that's 11 points of healing.

01:33:23.435 --> 01:33:25.425
MARISHA: (singing) That's amaze-balls!

01:33:27.895 --> 01:33:31.287
MATT: 11 points to Beau. You come back to
consciousness on the ground, your body was just

01:33:31.357 --> 01:33:35.579
starting to roll and slip into the water. You
catch one of the rocks and keep yourself from

01:33:35.579 --> 01:33:37.405
going back into the drink.

01:33:37.405 --> 01:33:41.547
MARISHA: I'm going to try to still play dead.

01:33:41.547 --> 01:33:47.205
LAURA: That's all I can do and my action, and I'm
not going to move.

01:33:47.205 --> 01:33:48.920
MATT: Well, your action was to--

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.175
LAURA: Invoke Duplicity.

01:33:50.175 --> 01:33:54.367
MATT: Right, that's correct. That finishes your go
there. Caleb, you're up.

01:33:54.367 --> 01:33:55.959
MARISHA: Thanks, Jester!

01:33:55.959 --> 01:34:01.416
LIAM: Ja, how far can I get towards this one
over there? Even if it means going in the water.

01:34:01.416 --> 01:34:04.514
MATT: Over here? You can get partway into the
water.

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:06.321
LIAM: Will I get within 30 feet of him?

01:34:06.321 --> 01:34:07.718
MATT: Possibly?

01:34:07.718 --> 01:34:09.286
LIAM: Well, show me how far--

01:34:09.286 --> 01:34:14.821
MATT: He's here. That's (counting) 30, so most
likely.

01:34:14.821 --> 01:34:17.804
LIAM: I'm going to try it. I'm going to wade in.

01:34:17.804 --> 01:34:29.902
MATT: (counting) Just outside of 30 for the
range.

01:34:29.902 --> 01:34:32.917
LAURA: Attack the one next to Beau. (coos)

01:34:33.106 --> 01:34:34.512
(laughter)

01:34:34.512 --> 01:34:42.511
LIAM: I was considering it, it's just not what I
wanted to do. I'm going to cast Dispel Magic on

01:34:42.511 --> 01:34:44.708
the storm above me.

01:34:44.767 --> 01:34:48.239
ALL: Ooh!

01:34:51.864 --> 01:34:59.215
MATT: Looking at that, I believe the level is
level three or lower? It's a 3rd-level spell. The

01:34:59.215 --> 01:35:07.380
storm immediately, with one final crackle, fades
and dissipates above. The cavern above now just

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:11.745
the empty, dark roof it was before, the storm no
longer present.

01:35:11.745 --> 01:35:20.391
LIAM: Everybody hears (nervous laughter).

01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:22.740
MATT: That ends Caleb's turn. Molly, you're up.

01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:31.134
TALIESIN: I am yelling: Fjord! I am going to take
a swing at the one that's looking a little rough.

01:35:31.134 --> 01:35:38.330
I believe it's that one, yeah. Oh my fucking god.
11.

01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:42.394
MATT: 11 does not hit. You have three more attacks
with your bonus action, if you want to.

01:35:42.394 --> 01:35:43.531
TALIESIN: 24.

01:35:43.531 --> 01:35:49.915
MATT: 24 hits. Roll damage on that.

01:35:49.915 --> 01:35:51.248
TALIESIN: Nine points of damage.

01:35:51.248 --> 01:35:54.585
MATT: Nine points of damage, all righty.

01:35:54.585 --> 01:35:55.525
TALIESIN: Still standing?

01:35:55.525 --> 01:35:56.496
MATT: Barely.

01:35:56.496 --> 01:36:00.640
TALIESIN: I'll swing again. 23.

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.697
MATT: 23 hits.

01:36:02.697 --> 01:36:05.961
TALIESIN: Ten points of damage.

01:36:05.961 --> 01:36:08.425
MATT: That'll do it, how do you want to do this?

01:36:08.425 --> 01:36:12.240
TALIESIN: I'm literally just a windmill at this
point.

01:36:12.286 --> 01:36:17.022
MATT: A whirling dervish of blades as you carve
through. You start biting through with the blades,

01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:20.828
carves one part of its chest, part of its arm,
down on its chest, looks up and right

01:36:20.878 --> 01:36:22.208
through its face.

01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:25.407
TALIESIN: Then spinning around, I go right to face
the other one and I'm going to take my last attack

01:36:25.407 --> 01:36:26.246
against it.

01:36:26.246 --> 01:36:28.760
MATT: Go for it.

01:36:29.889 --> 01:36:33.648
TALIESIN: Nope. I don't even know why I'm
bothering.

01:36:33.648 --> 01:36:41.134
LAURA: It's okay, stick with the ones that were
good for you. That one and the pink one.

01:36:41.134 --> 01:36:46.053
MATT: That finishes Molly's turn. Nott.

01:36:46.053 --> 01:36:52.052
SAM: I hand the books to little Kiri and I say:
Keep these safe.

01:36:52.052 --> 01:36:55.764
MATT: (like Jester) "Wrapped around his weenie?"

01:36:55.764 --> 01:37:02.573
SAM: Good idea. I'll take a little bit of fleece
and rip it and cast Silent Image, and make a wall

01:37:02.573 --> 01:37:05.738
of stone around Kiri. Just say: Don't move.

01:37:05.738 --> 01:37:10.975
MATT: Okay. You cannot see Kiri, just vanishes
amongst the visuals of the illusion.

01:37:10.975 --> 01:37:15.794
SAM: Go over to the water, put my foot in, and
then--

01:37:18.834 --> 01:37:21.764
withdraw it, and take a big swig.

01:37:21.764 --> 01:37:25.472
(laughter)

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:28.685
MATT: All right, finishing Nott's turn. Fjord.
Where do you want to emerge?

01:37:28.685 --> 01:37:36.512
TRAVIS: I forgot to do the 2d8 of booming damage
on the gentleman behind Molly. So that's a big

01:37:36.523 --> 01:37:40.634
one, and three, so four points of booming damage.

01:37:40.634 --> 01:37:41.937
MATT: Well, technically that was the other guy.

01:37:41.937 --> 01:37:42.936
TRAVIS: Oh was it?

01:37:42.936 --> 01:37:44.647
MATT: Yeah. They shifted around.

01:37:44.647 --> 01:37:45.947
TRAVIS: Ah. They do-si-doed?

01:37:45.947 --> 01:37:46.591
MATT: They did.

01:37:46.591 --> 01:37:54.107
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Can I appear right next to
this gentleman on his reverse? There you go. I

01:37:54.107 --> 01:37:56.036
will break my--

01:37:56.036 --> 01:38:01.776
MATT: If you'd like to-- fucking stay! If you want
to, you can appear up top there and get

01:38:01.824 --> 01:38:02.950
a flanking bonus.

01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:06.684
TRAVIS: That sounds dandy.

01:38:06.684 --> 01:38:11.134
MATT: You can use it against them, they can use it
against you, as long as you are directly across

01:38:11.134 --> 01:38:14.261
from an enemy with an ally, you can give yourself
flanking benefit.

01:38:14.261 --> 01:38:19.973
TRAVIS: Great. I will break my Hex, and I will use
a Hexblade's Curse as my bonus action

01:38:20.033 --> 01:38:21.477
on that gentleman.

01:38:21.477 --> 01:38:24.178
MATT: On this one? Okay. There you go.

01:38:28.865 --> 01:38:32.059
TRAVIS: I will make two attacks with the
Wastehunter falchion against him with the

01:38:32.059 --> 01:38:33.220
monstrous--

01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.194
MATT: Go for it.

01:38:34.194 --> 01:38:37.357
TRAVIS: Flanking gets-- what does it add? Does it
do anything?

01:38:37.357 --> 01:38:38.471
MATT: Flanking? It's advantage on your attacks.

01:38:38.471 --> 01:38:43.630
TRAVIS: Okay, so first attack. 15.

01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:45.148
MATT: 15 does hit.

01:38:45.148 --> 01:38:54.881
TRAVIS: Great. And the second one. Neither of
those are a crit, but that's a 24 on the second one.

01:38:54.927 --> 01:38:57.226
MATT: That hits, roll damage for each.

01:38:57.226 --> 01:39:07.347
TRAVIS: (counting) 17. For the Hexblade, four
points of damage, so 21 on the first one.

01:39:07.347 --> 01:39:17.097
(counting) 17 on the second.

01:39:17.097 --> 01:39:21.239
MATT: How do you want to do this? You fucked that
guy up.

01:39:21.239 --> 01:39:24.807
TRAVIS: I'll shift in right behind him and see
Molly looking around, give him a little wink, and

01:39:24.807 --> 01:39:28.721
I'll take the falchion and take the back of his
head off.

01:39:28.721 --> 01:39:34.935
MATT: Molly, it's pulling back ready to leap at
you, and as it lurches towards you it stops, you

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:39.622
watch as the upper half of its shoulders and head
slip and slough off into the water.

01:39:39.622 --> 01:39:40.828
TALIESIN: You fucking arsehole.

01:39:40.828 --> 01:39:54.520
TRAVIS: Sorry. I was getting what for, man. Shit.
And I'll-- oh wait. Natural 20. Peace out!

01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:03.298
MATT: You vanish out of the space. That's a hell
of a round. Yasha, you're up.

01:40:03.298 --> 01:40:11.223
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to go after this buddy
here. Are we flanking him, technically?

01:40:11.275 --> 01:40:13.785
MATT: Right now? No.

01:40:13.785 --> 01:40:17.409
LAURA: Technically, because Beau's on the ground?

01:40:17.409 --> 01:40:21.590
MATT: Beau is not threatening. You have to be on
the opposite sides.

01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:25.279
ASHLEY: So disadvantage still?

01:40:25.279 --> 01:40:28.689
MATT: Yep, because you're in the water.

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:36.006
ASHLEY: 13.

01:40:36.006 --> 01:40:37.743
MATT: 13 just hits.

01:40:37.743 --> 01:40:45.356
TALIESIN: Oh god, that looked like a one for a
moment. Sevens are scary. No, it was a seven. I

01:40:45.356 --> 01:40:46.843
was just staring at it going: oh no.

01:40:46.843 --> 01:40:48.094
ASHLEY: Did I get it, though?

01:40:48.094 --> 01:40:48.914
TALIESIN: Yeah you did, you're right.

01:40:48.914 --> 01:40:53.759
LAURA: How much damage do you do? Because you hit
it.

01:40:53.759 --> 01:40:55.458
ASHLEY: Oh shit. Sorry.

01:40:55.458 --> 01:41:00.096
TRAVIS: I heal 13 points.

01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:01.964
MATT: Nice.

01:41:01.964 --> 01:41:05.635
ASHLEY: 14 for the first hit.

01:41:05.635 --> 01:41:11.973
MATT: It's hanging on by a thread.

01:41:11.973 --> 01:41:25.324
ASHLEY: Okay, that hits. Eight points of damage.

01:41:25.324 --> 01:41:27.293
MATT: Yeah, that'll do it. How do you want to do
this?

01:41:27.293 --> 01:41:32.810
ASHLEY: I'm going to take my blade, slit it in its
throat, pull its tongue through and give him a

01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:34.447
Xhorhasian necktie!

01:41:34.447 --> 01:41:37.422
(cheering)

01:41:37.422 --> 01:41:39.062
TRAVIS: That's that barbarian shit!

01:41:39.062 --> 01:41:44.448
MATT: So one-handed wide swing, with the same
motion, you reach up right into the wound, tear it

01:41:44.448 --> 01:41:49.215
through, and maintain eye contact as it tumbles
over into the water and disappears beneath the

01:41:49.215 --> 01:41:51.388
surface.

01:41:51.388 --> 01:41:55.923
TRAVIS: All day. I'm up for that all day. That's
what I'm here for.

01:41:55.923 --> 01:41:57.611
LIAM: That did not sound good.

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:00.956
MATT: That ends your turn? You still have your
movement.

01:42:00.956 --> 01:42:05.269
ASHLEY: Beau, what are you at? Oh no, I can't do
that.

01:42:05.269 --> 01:42:10.763
MARISHA: On my back, out of air, I go: That was
awesome!

01:42:10.763 --> 01:42:14.886
ASHLEY: All right, could I walk over a little bit
so I can stand on the--

01:42:14.886 --> 01:42:16.353
LAURA: Stairs?

01:42:16.353 --> 01:42:19.676
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I'm not in the water.

01:42:19.676 --> 01:42:23.842
MATT: You're right next to Beau on the ground. You
got out of the water. All right, ends your turn?

01:42:23.842 --> 01:42:25.394
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:42:25.394 --> 01:42:31.203
MATT: There's a sound in the nearby water, as,
emerging from one of the other caverns on the

01:42:31.203 --> 01:42:40.981
side, another merrow emerges from that side and
another emerges from this side. The one up top

01:42:40.981 --> 01:42:53.005
here that sees everyone closing in is going to
back up into the water, and is going to cast Call

01:42:53.005 --> 01:43:00.918
Lightning again. It wants to bring it about. Use
the other level three spell slot. With that, as

01:43:00.918 --> 01:43:05.047
the cloud forms up in the sky again, seeing you
step out of the water, you do not have

01:43:05.047 --> 01:43:07.667
disadvantage on the saving throw, but I need you
to make another dexterity saving throw.

01:43:07.667 --> 01:43:17.294
ASHLEY: 14.

01:43:17.294 --> 01:43:28.874
MATT: It is a 13 DC, so you only take half damage.
Which is good, because that would be 24 damage, so

01:43:28.874 --> 01:43:30.797
you take 12 points of lightning damage.

01:43:30.797 --> 01:43:33.166
ASHLEY: 12, you said?

01:43:33.166 --> 01:43:34.564
MATT: Yes, 12 points of lightning damage.

01:43:34.564 --> 01:43:37.027
SAM: She's got, like, 100 more points.

01:43:37.027 --> 01:43:38.241
TALIESIN: Nah.

01:43:38.241 --> 01:43:41.604
ASHLEY: I'm, as Matt would say, looking rough.

01:43:41.604 --> 01:43:50.353
MATT: He's going to dive into the water. You know
where he disappeared beneath the surface as you

01:43:50.353 --> 01:43:56.864
see the water rippling out, but you're not sure
where he is or how deep he is. These two have

01:43:56.864 --> 01:44:01.978
emerged. This one's going to move through the
water to there, and is going to make a harpoon--

01:44:01.978 --> 01:44:06.808
Let's move over a bit further because it can, to
about there. It's going to make a harpoon strike

01:44:06.808 --> 01:44:13.256
towards you, Yasha, throwing it in your direction.
That's a 20 to hit.

01:44:13.256 --> 01:44:15.100
ASHLEY: Yeah, that hits.

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:20.155
MATT: All right, you take-- that's a bad roll,
eight points of piercing damage reduced to half,

01:44:20.155 --> 01:44:23.721
so you take four points of piercing damage. I need
you to make a strength check, so roll a d20 and

01:44:23.721 --> 01:44:26.594
add your strength modifier as it's attempting to
yank and pull you towards him.

01:44:26.594 --> 01:44:28.108
TRAVIS: Let him know!

01:44:28.108 --> 01:44:30.131
SAM: This is your thing, you are strong!

01:44:30.131 --> 01:44:38.042
ASHLEY: Get out of the thing, go away. Okay, okay,
okay. Oh shit.

01:44:38.042 --> 01:44:40.572
MATT: You have advantage on your strength checks
because you're raging.

01:44:40.572 --> 01:44:45.789
ASHLEY: Oh, I do! That's not much better. Ten!

01:44:45.789 --> 01:44:53.040
MATT: He pulled a 13, natural nine plus four. You
get yanked. Beau, you watch as Yasha gets yanked

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.842
over you as you're lying on the ground, and it's
going to attempt to bite you as you're down in the

01:44:58.842 --> 01:45:06.304
water once more. Natural 19. That's 25 to hit. So
with that, the bite attack, let's roll damage on

01:45:06.304 --> 01:45:13.581
that. That is going to be ten points of piercing
damage, reduced to five, 'cause you're raging.

01:45:13.581 --> 01:45:15.415
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:45:15.415 --> 01:45:22.776
MATT: This guy here is going to go ahead and move
up right next to Caleb, rushing out of the water

01:45:22.776 --> 01:45:30.732
from underneath with the harpoon in its arms, and
jam it towards your torso. That's going to be a 15

01:45:30.732 --> 01:45:31.838
to hit.

01:45:31.838 --> 01:45:32.882
LIAM: Shield.

01:45:32.882 --> 01:45:38.104
MATT: All right. You watch as it deflects off of
your body. It's going to angrily attempt to bite

01:45:38.104 --> 01:45:42.473
down on you. That's a natural 17 plus six.

01:45:42.473 --> 01:45:47.626
LIAM: I will use the dodecahedron and roll a 20 on
this side. I got a natural two.

01:45:47.626 --> 01:45:49.790
SAM: So you're rerolling for him.

01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:55.242
LIAM: I get to choose, it says it on this paper.
Alternatively, after an attack roll is made

01:45:55.242 --> 01:46:00.147
against me, I can expend the fragment to roll an
additional d20 and choose. So two plus whatever.

01:46:00.147 --> 01:46:05.416
MATT: As it attempts to bite down towards you,
there's a brief moment where the bite sinks into

01:46:05.416 --> 01:46:09.962
your shoulder, and there's a brief burst where
time seems to dart back, and you step out of the

01:46:09.962 --> 01:46:12.719
way as its bite hits air with no effect.

01:46:12.719 --> 01:46:14.420
LIAM: Caleb will remember this.

01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:20.239
MATT: All right. That ends their turn. Now it is
Beau.

01:46:20.239 --> 01:46:32.527
MARISHA: I'm good. I'm still alive. And I get up.
I go, (slurred) Who's-- who's next? And I run over--

01:46:32.527 --> 01:46:36.481
MATT: It's half your movement to get up, so you
have 20 movement.

01:46:36.481 --> 01:46:37.998
MARISHA: I have 20 movement.

01:46:37.998 --> 01:46:39.378
TRAVIS: She healed up drunk.

01:46:39.378 --> 01:46:41.899
MATT: Wouldn't she, though?

01:46:41.899 --> 01:46:43.385
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:46:43.385 --> 01:46:53.427
MARISHA: Am I able to, if I use Step of the Wind,
am I able to make it around and get to this one

01:46:53.427 --> 01:46:55.028
who's harrassing Caleb?

01:46:55.028 --> 01:46:56.625
MATT: You can certainly try.

01:46:56.625 --> 01:47:03.577
MARISHA: 'Cause I'd have 20 more movement and then my
speed, which is 40. So I should be able to make it.

01:47:03.577 --> 01:47:09.970
MATT: You should. Do you want to try? All right.
So five, ten, 15, and then go ahead and make an

01:47:09.970 --> 01:47:14.061
athletics check to make the leap. I'm letting you
see if you can make it across the water without

01:47:14.061 --> 01:47:17.575
losing your movement.

01:47:17.575 --> 01:47:19.818
SAM: You're great at jumping over small bodies of
liquid, Marisha.

01:47:19.818 --> 01:47:22.143
MARISHA: I am. Yeah, that's 15.

01:47:22.143 --> 01:47:35.348
MATT: 15? Yeah. (counting) You're just outside of
it to be within melee.

01:47:35.348 --> 01:47:38.841
MARISHA: Really? I've got extended melee. Come on,
man.

01:47:38.841 --> 01:47:46.252
MATT: (counting) Actually, 35, 40, you can do it
with just one if you're there. So you manage to

01:47:46.252 --> 01:47:49.375
spin around, using your bonus action for Step of
the Wind, so you still have your action.

01:47:49.375 --> 01:47:54.983
MARISHA: All right, two attacks. Let's see what
happens. First one: natural 20!

01:47:54.983 --> 01:47:57.908
(yelling)

01:47:57.908 --> 01:48:05.431
MARISHA: I'm super pissed off! Okay, okay, okay.
Roll high on this one. That's good. 12 plus

01:48:05.431 --> 01:48:07.069
another six. That's 18.

01:48:07.069 --> 01:48:11.208
MATT: 18 points of damage on that one. Damn.
Nice.

01:48:11.208 --> 01:48:12.808
MARISHA: I hate fish.

01:48:12.808 --> 01:48:16.746
TRAVIS: Hate-fish. They have great sushi there.

01:48:16.746 --> 01:48:23.014
MARISHA: And then I'm going to take the end of my
bo, jab it right in its throat, see if I can get

01:48:23.014 --> 01:48:24.430
another one.

01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:27.860
LIAM: That's cocked. You've got to take the good
with the bad.

01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:29.585
MARISHA: Ten.

01:48:29.585 --> 01:48:33.366
MATT: Ten misses, however the critical did-- as
you run up from the side, you parkour off the

01:48:33.366 --> 01:48:37.526
wall, the side of the pillar there, leap, whack!
Slam it with the staff. You see its head get

01:48:37.526 --> 01:48:43.143
pushed underwater again. It turns around; its eyes
are adjusting like yours were a moment ago, and as

01:48:43.143 --> 01:48:47.818
you go to swing a second time, it does manage to
deflect it with the side of its trident. No impact.

01:48:47.818 --> 01:48:49.829
MARISHA: I think that's all I've got.

01:48:49.829 --> 01:48:52.298
MATT: All right, that finishes Beau's turn. Jester,
you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

01:48:52.353 --> 01:48:57.347
LAURA: Are any of them looking rough?

01:48:57.347 --> 01:49:03.294
MATT: At the moment? This one's been hurt, this
one has not been, and this one is not visible. It

01:49:03.294 --> 01:49:05.729
is beneath the surface of the water.

01:49:05.729 --> 01:49:19.227
LAURA: I'm going to have Jester run up to the one
that Beau just hit-- yeah, the me. Yeah. And I'm

01:49:19.227 --> 01:49:23.692
going to Inflict Wounds on it at level one.

01:49:23.692 --> 01:49:29.469
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and roll a melee spell
attack on it. If you want to move here, you can

01:49:29.469 --> 01:49:34.161
flank it. All righty. So you're opposite of Beau,
using that flank maneuver. So don't forget, you

01:49:34.161 --> 01:49:37.662
guys can flank on direct opposites. They can also
flank against you.

01:49:37.662 --> 01:49:39.286
TRAVIS: So what is it? What is it?

01:49:39.286 --> 01:49:40.817
TALIESIN: I don't even know why I bother.

01:49:40.817 --> 01:49:42.126
TRAVIS: At advantage, too?

01:49:42.126 --> 01:49:44.097
MATT: Oh, natural one and a natural four.

01:49:44.097 --> 01:49:50.009
LAURA: It's a touch, though. Yeah, no, it doesn't
matter. They're slippery little suckers.

01:49:50.009 --> 01:49:54.770
MATT: So as you swing out with your hand, your
foot catches the edge of one of the pebbles, and

01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:58.383
you stumble for a second, and your hand goes wide
off to the side, hits some of the stone on the

01:49:58.383 --> 01:50:03.953
wall behind you and releases the spell's impact
against lifeless wall, unfortunately.

01:50:03.953 --> 01:50:05.936
MARISHA: Don't touch attacks avoid AC?

01:50:05.936 --> 01:50:07.721
MATT: No, that's Pathfinder rules.

01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:11.618
MARISHA: Aw. Man, that's old school.

01:50:11.618 --> 01:50:15.717
LAURA: For my bonus, I'm going to move my
Spiritual Weapon and try to do the same thing and

01:50:15.717 --> 01:50:16.940
hit it.

01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.500
MATT: That it can do.

01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.369
LAURA: Can I flank it and get a bonus on--

01:50:20.369 --> 01:50:21.840
MATT: No, not technically a creature.

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.447
LAURA: Okay, that hits.

01:50:24.447 --> 01:50:26.539
MATT: All right, so 2d8 plus four.

01:50:26.539 --> 01:50:27.939
TRAVIS: Come on, now!

01:50:27.939 --> 01:50:29.933
LAURA: 11.

01:50:29.933 --> 01:50:34.981
MATT: 11 points of damage. Crack! The giant
lollipop swings and hits the side of the jaw. It

01:50:34.981 --> 01:50:38.682
dislodges for a second, then for a moment it's
trying to hold the trident with one hand and the

01:50:38.682 --> 01:50:40.579
other's trying to push it back into place.

01:50:40.579 --> 01:50:42.361
LAURA: And I say, tastes good, doesn't it?

01:50:42.361 --> 01:50:45.034
MATT: (laughs) Awesome. That finishes your go.
Caleb, you're up.

01:50:45.034 --> 01:50:49.214
LIAM: I'm going to save my higher stuff for the
guy who's disappeared, so I'm going to Fire Bolt

01:50:49.214 --> 01:50:51.674
it right at point-blank range at disadvantage.

01:50:51.674 --> 01:50:52.933
MATT: All righty.

01:50:52.933 --> 01:50:54.231
LIAM: Ugh.

01:50:54.231 --> 01:51:00.842
(laughter)

01:51:00.842 --> 01:51:02.127
LIAM: I rolled a two.

01:51:02.127 --> 01:51:06.179
MATT: Nope. Nope. You get scared in the moment,
because you're still thrashing in the water, and

01:51:06.179 --> 01:51:11.433
you put the hand up and go (effort sound, fizzle).
You were aiming six feet from it. It goes up like

01:51:11.433 --> 01:51:13.030
a firework and hits the roof.

01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:18.030
LIAM: I'm going to crouch down into the water and
submerge up to my neck in the hopes that it does

01:51:18.089 --> 01:51:20.896
not know where I am and I'm too short to be hit.

01:51:20.896 --> 01:51:22.940
TRAVIS: Like the gas range, he's trying to--

01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:25.331
MATT: That ends Caleb's go. Molly, you're up.

01:51:25.331 --> 01:51:27.789
TALIESIN: Shite.

01:51:27.789 --> 01:51:29.895
SAM: You're super fast. Remember, you're super
fast.

01:51:29.895 --> 01:51:31.271
MATT: You have 60 feet of movement.

01:51:31.271 --> 01:51:32.558
LAURA: Help Yasha!

01:51:32.558 --> 01:51:37.581
TALIESIN: Yeah, I suppose we're doing-- yeah.

01:51:37.581 --> 01:51:39.928
LIAM: Flank that Yasha enemy! (pigeon coos)

01:51:39.928 --> 01:51:42.075
TALIESIN: Running to the Yasha creature.

01:51:42.075 --> 01:51:43.806
MATT: Are you running through the water or going
to make a leap across?

01:51:43.806 --> 01:51:49.780
TALIESIN: I'm going to run through the water.
Speed's doubled.

01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:55.355
MATT: (counting) If you want to flank, you'll be
in the water, which is disadvantage on your attacks.

01:51:55.355 --> 01:51:58.040
TALIESIN: That doesn't matter, then.

01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:04.444
LIAM: Advantage to disadvantage, straight roll.

01:52:04.457 --> 01:52:08.603
MATT: It's a straight roll if you stay there, or a
straight roll if you end up flanking it. Yes.

01:52:08.659 --> 01:52:11.835
TALIESIN: Actually, here's an interesting thing,
is-- oh, god, yeah. I don't want to be in the

01:52:11.835 --> 01:52:15.251
water, so I'm going to stay on that little patch
of land so I don't get--

01:52:15.251 --> 01:52:17.591
MATT: So make your four attacks on it, if you
want.

01:52:17.591 --> 01:52:23.293
TALIESIN: All right, first two rounds. That's a 14
and a natural 20.

01:52:23.293 --> 01:52:25.444
MATT: Okay, yeah, that'll do.

01:52:25.444 --> 01:52:28.515
TALIESIN: So the natural 20 is double the dice?

01:52:28.515 --> 01:52:29.879
MATT: Yep, just roll the dice.

01:52:29.879 --> 01:52:43.877
TALIESIN: All right. Eh. That's nine. And the
other one is 11.

01:52:43.877 --> 01:52:47.854
MATT: 11 points of damage. And then your third
strike with your Haste.

01:52:47.854 --> 01:52:53.985
TALIESIN: Third and fourth. That's-- one of them
misses, but the other one's 19, the other one

01:52:53.985 --> 01:52:55.896
hits, the other one is ten.

01:52:55.896 --> 01:52:58.317
MATT: All right, so that hits on the third strike,
there.

01:52:58.317 --> 01:53:02.090
TALIESIN: That's better. 11 points of damage.

01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:09.249
MATT: Ooh. 31 points of damage in one round. As
you're carving through it rapidly, it is looking

01:53:09.249 --> 01:53:15.321
pretty hurt. It's not on death's door, but you
singlehandedly carved it pretty hard in one round.

01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:17.121
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action--

01:53:17.121 --> 01:53:18.782
MATT: You already used your bonus action.

01:53:18.782 --> 01:53:22.723
TALIESIN: Oh, I did, for the attack! Never mind.
Never mind. That's literally everything I can do.

01:53:22.723 --> 01:53:24.934
MATT: All right, that ends Molly's go. Nott.

01:53:24.934 --> 01:53:34.522
SAM: See, Kiri, I think they would have called if
they really needed me. I think no news is good

01:53:34.522 --> 01:53:36.901
news, and--

01:53:36.901 --> 01:53:38.943
TRAVIS: Just then, a couple bubbles.

01:53:38.943 --> 01:53:45.616
SAM: That's probably a good sign. And the water
looks cold anyway, and you could get hypothermia,

01:53:45.616 --> 01:53:55.718
so, you know, I've got to protect you, and, yeah.
That's my turn.

01:53:55.718 --> 01:53:58.198
(laughter)

01:53:58.198 --> 01:54:02.905
MATT: That's amazing. Okay, Fjord, you're up. As
you reapparate within ten feet of where you were--

01:54:02.905 --> 01:54:06.549
TRAVIS: Closer to Molly. And I go, boo! Ah, shit.

01:54:06.549 --> 01:54:11.300
MARISHA: Party's left.

01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:17.019
TRAVIS: Fuck. And seeing that they're engaged
elsewhere, I'll fire my first two Eldritch Blasts

01:54:17.019 --> 01:54:22.946
at the one that's engaged with Molly and Yasha.
Which is 18 to hit.

01:54:22.946 --> 01:54:26.123
MATT: Just remembering, why did you drop Hex
again? It was because you cast--

01:54:26.123 --> 01:54:27.461
TRAVIS: Hexblade's Curse.

01:54:27.461 --> 01:54:31.357
MATT: All righty. So first strike was 18, that
hits.

01:54:31.357 --> 01:54:36.589
TRAVIS: That is 12 points of damage.

01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:38.387
MATT: 12 points of damage, nice.

01:54:38.387 --> 01:54:45.043
TRAVIS: Is he still up? Then I'll send the second
one in his direction as well. That's 22 to hit.

01:54:45.043 --> 01:54:46.748
MATT: That works.

01:54:46.748 --> 01:54:49.756
TRAVIS: Seven points of damage.

01:54:49.756 --> 01:54:51.946
MATT: Seven points of damage, that'll do it. How
do you want to do this?

01:54:51.946 --> 01:54:53.438
(cheering)

01:54:53.438 --> 01:54:57.295
TRAVIS: I'll pop up and be like, fuck, the first
time I do it, son of a bitch. And I'll go

01:54:57.295 --> 01:55:01.253
(magical buzzing and whooshing) and send both
of them over there.

01:55:01.302 --> 01:55:05.599
MATT: Both (impacts) on its side. You watch as one
of its arms gets blown off and flings, landing on

01:55:05.599 --> 01:55:09.277
the top of the stairs before rolling down a few
steps and coming to rest.

01:55:09.277 --> 01:55:11.552
TRAVIS: As Molly looks over, I'm like (blows).

01:55:11.552 --> 01:55:17.678
MATT: It slips down into the water. Yasha, you
take one swipe at it for good measure as it sinks

01:55:17.678 --> 01:55:22.472
below. All right, and roll your d20 to see whether
you stay or go.

01:55:22.472 --> 01:55:24.549
TRAVIS: 13.

01:55:24.549 --> 01:55:26.705
ALL: (singing) Should I stay or should I go now?

01:55:26.705 --> 01:55:28.791
TRAVIS: It's important to remember that you
don't--

01:55:28.791 --> 01:55:30.607
(laughter)

01:55:30.607 --> 01:55:31.816
TALIESIN: So irritating.

01:55:31.816 --> 01:55:32.819
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

01:55:32.819 --> 01:55:37.268
ASHLEY: All right. Can I get out of the water?

01:55:37.268 --> 01:55:42.023
MATT: Right now, you're in the water, so with full
speed, you're probably not going to get to it

01:55:42.023 --> 01:55:43.942
unless you take an action to dash.

01:55:43.942 --> 01:55:47.606
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll hop up back on that, out of the
water there.

01:55:47.606 --> 01:55:50.685
MATT: You have 30 feet of movement. There's the
guy who's underwater over here somewhere, and

01:55:50.685 --> 01:55:53.191
there's the guy that's currently assaulted by most
of your team on the other side.

01:55:53.191 --> 01:55:55.375
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll move closer to where I think
the guy is.

01:55:55.375 --> 01:55:58.001
MATT: (counting) There?

01:55:58.001 --> 01:56:05.298
ASHLEY: And then I will cast Healing Hands on
myself.

01:56:05.298 --> 01:56:09.234
MATT: Okay, so you reach down and touch the
front of your chest--

01:56:09.234 --> 01:56:10.989
ASHLEY: Bring me to a whole seven.

01:56:10.989 --> 01:56:12.275
MATT: Oh, shit.

01:56:12.275 --> 01:56:15.414
MARISHA: You were that bad? Wow.

01:56:15.414 --> 01:56:21.072
TALIESIN: Two. Two hit points. That's two kittens,
man.

01:56:21.072 --> 01:56:24.487
MATT: So that ends your turn?

01:56:24.487 --> 01:56:27.631
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe not a good idea to walk over
there.

01:56:27.631 --> 01:56:35.317
MATT: Emerging from the water, the water splashes
up as it glances up. On the other side, that one

01:56:35.317 --> 01:56:44.117
merrow's right there, have him surrounded, is
going to make one strike again towards Caleb. That

01:56:44.117 --> 01:56:45.862
is a 23 to hit.

01:56:45.862 --> 01:56:47.380
LIAM: I'll take it.

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:56.040
MATT: Okay. That comes to 12 points of piercing
damage. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:01.601
MARISHA: Do I have a reaction? Can I hit it?

01:57:01.601 --> 01:57:03.797
MATT: You can, because it's attacking someone
that's not you.

01:57:03.797 --> 01:57:06.232
MARISHA: Yes, Sentinel shit!

01:57:06.232 --> 01:57:09.113
LIAM: Get out of here, status thing.

01:57:09.113 --> 01:57:12.498
MARISHA: Terrible, terrible. That's a ten.

01:57:12.498 --> 01:57:14.606
LIAM: What was the damage before, DM?

01:57:14.606 --> 01:57:15.746
MATT: 12.

01:57:15.746 --> 01:57:23.149
LIAM: Thank you, thank you. My web browser's going
insane. I can't. Hold on.

01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:24.621
SAM: Refresh.

01:57:24.621 --> 01:57:25.986
TRAVIS: I got you. I got it right here.

01:57:25.986 --> 01:57:31.945
LIAM: I have no internet right now. I rolled a
six, and I don't know what my con is because I

01:57:31.945 --> 01:57:33.790
have lost--

01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:37.511
SAM: It's in your notebook somewhere. Your
character sheet. You printed it out somewhere, right?

01:57:37.511 --> 01:57:40.048
MARISHA: You don't have a print-out of your
character sheet?

01:57:40.048 --> 01:57:41.920
LIAM: Oh, you're right, I do, after you asked me
nine times.

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:46.508
(laughter)

01:57:46.508 --> 01:57:49.447
MATT: I believe your constitution is 14, if I
recall? Which brings a +2 to what you rolled.

01:57:49.447 --> 01:57:52.402
TRAVIS: If you got that right, that's some fucking
Beautiful Mind shit.

01:57:52.402 --> 01:57:59.462
MATT: Yeah, 14. Failure. Haste wears off, because
you lose concentration.

01:57:59.462 --> 01:58:04.143
TALIESIN: Oh god, does that mean I-- oh, shit. I'm
out for a round, aren't I?

01:58:04.143 --> 01:58:08.224
LIAM: Does the exhaustion happen when the spell's
broken?

01:58:08.224 --> 01:58:10.983
MATT: When the spell ends, the target can't move
or take actions.

01:58:10.983 --> 01:58:12.865
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:58:12.865 --> 01:58:16.836
LAURA: Oh, that's a shitty side effect.

01:58:16.836 --> 01:58:20.899
MATT: And, to follow that up, it's going to bite
down towards Caleb, seeing that you're probably

01:58:20.899 --> 01:58:26.934
the easiest meat around here, unarmored. That's a
natural 20. I'm having really good luck.

01:58:26.934 --> 01:58:28.749
LAURA: I'm easy meat!

01:58:28.749 --> 01:58:33.002
MARISHA: Check the lollipop, it's so inviting!

01:58:33.002 --> 01:58:34.603
ASHLEY: Tasty treat.

01:58:34.603 --> 01:58:41.162
MATT: All right, so with a bite attack against
you, that is 14 points of piercing damage to you, Caleb.

01:58:41.162 --> 01:58:51.103
LIAM: Okay. Earlier, I'm sorry, because the
internet shit the bed on me, so it was 12 plus 14.

01:58:51.103 --> 01:58:52.802
I'm still up.

01:58:52.802 --> 01:59:00.240
MATT: Oh my god. Okay. Ending that turn, the other
one standing there emerges, the storm in the sky.

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:07.323
It sees you standing up again and goes (growls).
Sounds like some horrible curse. I need you to

01:59:07.323 --> 01:59:08.955
make a dexterity saving throw.

01:59:08.955 --> 01:59:13.876
TRAVIS: You know what, it's okay, because there's
fucking smoke on our map.

01:59:13.876 --> 01:59:15.706
MARISHA: It looks great.

01:59:15.706 --> 01:59:16.981
TALIESIN: I'm pleased.

01:59:16.981 --> 01:59:20.362
MATT: Thank you, Taliesin. A great gift I'm glad
I've been able to use finally.

01:59:20.362 --> 01:59:22.145
ASHLEY: 18.

01:59:22.145 --> 01:59:25.062
MATT: 18, okay, so half damage. We'll see what it
rolls.

01:59:25.062 --> 01:59:28.891
TRAVIS: Come on, 13 or less.

01:59:28.891 --> 01:59:36.935
MATT: That is a nine, a one, and a three. 13
points of damage. Lightning damage. Halved to six.

01:59:36.935 --> 01:59:40.521
Not even joking. You can look at the dice.

01:59:40.521 --> 01:59:41.984
TRAVIS: I believe you.

01:59:41.984 --> 01:59:43.336
MATT: I can't fucking believe that.

01:59:43.336 --> 01:59:46.694
SAM and LAURA: She's okay.

01:59:46.694 --> 01:59:49.525
TRAVIS: Yep, you're at one.

01:59:49.525 --> 01:59:53.672
MATT: You are a fucking warlock, is what that is.
You know that, but--

01:59:53.672 --> 01:59:55.622
TRAVIS: (singing) You got the perfect warlock.

01:59:55.622 --> 01:59:57.247
(laughter)

01:59:57.247 --> 01:59:58.659
MATT: God damn it.

01:59:58.659 --> 02:00:00.143
TALIESIN: Holy cow.

02:00:00.143 --> 02:00:06.652
MATT: And is going to vanish once more beneath the
surface of the water. You don't know quite where

02:00:06.652 --> 02:00:12.664
it is, that's where you last saw it disappear.
That brings us to Beau.

02:00:12.664 --> 02:00:22.340
MARISHA: It's me already? Oh, shit. I'm going to
unleash on this guy. Again, crack, crack, see what

02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:23.565
happens.

02:00:23.565 --> 02:00:26.103
MATT: You have advantage on these because you're
flanked currently with Jester.

02:00:26.103 --> 02:00:32.071
MARISHA: Oh, goodness gracious! Yes! I'm going to
try and use my staff to pole vault me up in the

02:00:32.071 --> 02:00:44.277
air and go crack, crack, with two big swoopy
swoops. I'll take the 13, eight plus six is 13. 14!

02:00:44.277 --> 02:00:46.372
MATT: 14 hits him. Armor class of 13.

02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:55.024
MARISHA: That's eight plus another four so that's
12 damage for the first one. Second one. That

02:00:55.024 --> 02:00:58.436
hits, 18.

02:00:58.436 --> 02:01:00.723
MATT: 18 hits, roll damage for the second strike.

02:01:00.723 --> 02:01:02.867
MARISHA: Five damage.

02:01:02.867 --> 02:01:10.469
MATT: Whack, whack! You hit both sides with the
staff. It's being knocked around, spitting blood

02:01:10.469 --> 02:01:11.733
out of its mouth. It's hurt.

02:01:11.733 --> 02:01:13.960
MARISHA: It's hurt.

02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:16.997
SAM: Mildly hurt.

02:01:16.997 --> 02:01:18.691
MATT: It's hurt pretty bad.

02:01:18.691 --> 02:01:26.461
MARISHA: I have one more ki point. I can stun it,
or I can do Flurry of Blows and try to kill it.

02:01:26.504 --> 02:01:29.194
LAURA: Kill it! Flurry of Blows it!

02:01:29.194 --> 02:01:31.810
MARISHA: All right, last ki point. Flurry of
Blows.

02:01:31.810 --> 02:01:34.067
MATT: Make two more strikes against it.

02:01:34.067 --> 02:01:36.495
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (chanting) Apology, apology!

02:01:36.495 --> 02:01:38.070
SAM: Guilt attack!

02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:39.965
TRAVIS: "Did I say I was sorry?"

02:01:39.965 --> 02:01:47.808
MARISHA: Hey Caleb, we should talk later. I'll
take that 13, so it's 20 for the first attack. And

02:01:47.808 --> 02:01:57.327
then 12? No. Yes. No, 12.

02:01:57.327 --> 02:01:59.365
MATT: 12 does not hit, but one of them does.

02:01:59.365 --> 02:02:06.487
MARISHA: Stupid. Seven damage.

02:02:06.487 --> 02:02:08.828
MATT: Seven points of damage, how do you want to
do this?

02:02:08.828 --> 02:02:11.876
(cheering)

02:02:11.876 --> 02:02:19.670
MARISHA: I pole vault up, do the two hits, and
then I want to parkour off of the spiritual weapon

02:02:19.670 --> 02:02:27.679
a little bit, Marty McFly on the lollipop, and
then do a flying roundhouse to his face!

02:02:27.679 --> 02:02:35.775
MATT: Whack! Right across his face. The impact
throws its head with such a speed down onto the

02:02:35.775 --> 02:02:42.236
rocks, right at the bottom of Jester's feet.
Crack! It slowly slides, gurgling, into the water,

02:02:42.236 --> 02:02:43.734
sinking below.

02:02:43.734 --> 02:02:52.428
MARISHA: I stand up, throw my hair out of my face,
and that ends my turn.

02:02:52.428 --> 02:02:54.824
MATT: Jester, you're up.

02:02:54.824 --> 02:03:00.937
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds. I'm
going to walk up behind Caleb and give him a hug

02:03:00.937 --> 02:03:04.592
around the waist and say: you're okay, my friend.

02:03:04.592 --> 02:03:07.519
LIAM: He's like this in the water.

02:03:07.519 --> 02:03:23.259
LAURA: I cast at level two, so that's 2d8 plus
four. 12 points of healing for you. For my bonus

02:03:23.259 --> 02:03:33.899
action, I'm going to have my duplicity self run up
and stand right next to the spot where the fish

02:03:33.899 --> 02:03:36.526
wizard comes out.

02:03:36.526 --> 02:03:37.399
MATT: Right there?

02:03:37.399 --> 02:03:39.575
LAURA: Yeah. She's going to--

02:03:39.575 --> 02:03:41.367
TRAVIS: Look real mean.

02:03:41.367 --> 02:03:44.528
MATT: Good to know. Finishing your turn, Jester,
Caleb, you're up.

02:03:44.528 --> 02:03:50.434
LIAM: Am I able to wade onto the land, just behind
Beau there? Yeah, if I go in that direction, can I

02:03:50.434 --> 02:03:52.012
get off on dry land?

02:03:52.012 --> 02:03:55.234
MATT: You can just barely get onto land if you
want.

02:03:55.234 --> 02:04:00.356
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to do that, and as I'm doing
that, I'm pulling out my little clay cat's paw and

02:04:00.356 --> 02:04:04.909
I'm going to hold Maximilian's Earthen Grasp. As
soon as I hear fish talking in the water, I'm

02:04:04.909 --> 02:04:06.375
going to let it go.

02:04:06.375 --> 02:04:07.406
MATT: Okay.

02:04:07.406 --> 02:04:09.828
LAURA: I'm going to step out of the water, by the
way, for my movement.

02:04:09.828 --> 02:04:15.639
MATT: Okay, you step back. That ends your turn,
Caleb, as you're holding your action. Molly?

02:04:15.639 --> 02:04:21.755
TALIESIN: I'm going to (retching), and throw up
for a second, because I got vertigo because I lost

02:04:21.755 --> 02:04:23.837
Haste. And that's my turn.

02:04:23.837 --> 02:04:25.670
MATT: Nott?

02:04:25.670 --> 02:04:32.085
SAM: I'll take one more swig, and I'll jump in the
water.

02:04:32.085 --> 02:04:39.533
MATT: With your movement, you get most of the way
across on the rope, but you can bonus action to dash.

02:04:39.533 --> 02:04:41.025
SAM: Bonus action dash!

02:04:41.025 --> 02:04:45.242
MATT: With that, Nott just barely emerges from the
distant pool of water.

02:04:45.242 --> 02:04:48.118
SAM: Where are they?! Let me at them! I'll save
you all!

02:04:48.118 --> 02:04:51.177
MATT: You don't see any monsters.

02:04:51.177 --> 02:04:56.147
SAM: Get this water off me! Ah!

02:04:56.147 --> 02:04:58.237
MATT: Nott's splashing behind you.

02:04:58.237 --> 02:05:00.076
SAM: I'll shake like a dog.

02:05:00.076 --> 02:05:01.358
MATT: Perfect. Fjord.

02:05:01.358 --> 02:05:03.306
TRAVIS: I'll reappear and take--

02:05:03.306 --> 02:05:04.397
MATT: Whereabouts?

02:05:04.397 --> 02:05:09.053
TRAVIS: Ten feet closer to Yasha's direction, on
land still. I will hold Eldritch Blast until I see

02:05:09.053 --> 02:05:10.574
the reappearance of--

02:05:10.574 --> 02:05:12.280
MATT: Good to know. Roll your dice.

02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:16.725
TRAVIS: To hit for it? Oh. Aww, shitballs.

02:05:16.725 --> 02:05:18.498
MARISHA: Oh no.

02:05:18.498 --> 02:05:20.187
TRAVIS: 16. Ah ha-- (yelps)

02:05:20.187 --> 02:05:24.539
MATT: Held actions and Blink can be a really
tricky thing.

02:05:24.539 --> 02:05:27.505
TRAVIS: Show your fucking fa-- (yelps)

02:05:27.505 --> 02:05:31.823
TALIESIN: Can you move while you're not blinked,
by the way?

02:05:31.823 --> 02:05:33.111
TRAVIS: No.

02:05:33.111 --> 02:05:34.897
SAM: Can you see into our world?

02:05:34.897 --> 02:05:36.284
TRAVIS: I can see and hear and all that stuff.

02:05:36.284 --> 02:05:38.156
MATT: It's like an ethereal-- like Frodo with the
ring on.

02:05:38.156 --> 02:05:41.669
TRAVIS: Guys? (distressed yelp)

02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:44.248
MATT: This is what Ripley used on you guys last
campaign.

02:05:44.248 --> 02:05:45.815
TRAVIS: Fuck you, Molly!

02:05:45.815 --> 02:05:47.959
MATT: That finishes Fjord's turn. Yasha, you're
up.

02:05:47.959 --> 02:06:03.199
ASHLEY: Oh my god, okay. I'm going to hold-- I'm
going to stay where I'm at. I've got nothing to

02:06:03.199 --> 02:06:06.668
attack so I'm just going to hold my turn until I,
you know.

02:06:06.668 --> 02:06:08.092
MATT: Hold your action in case something shows
up?

02:06:08.092 --> 02:06:10.317
ASHLEY: Yeah, in case something shows up in the
water and then I can--

02:06:10.317 --> 02:06:18.514
MATT: That ends your turn. That brings us the
merrow shallow priest's turn. As you're all

02:06:18.514 --> 02:06:24.897
focusing on this element, a small ripple of water
emerges over here as it has swum down below the

02:06:24.897 --> 02:06:25.890
water.

02:06:25.890 --> 02:06:26.991
LIAM: Cat's Paw!

02:06:26.991 --> 02:06:28.239
MATT: Cat's Paw. What does it have to roll for it?

02:06:28.239 --> 02:06:29.985
LIAM: 16. Strength.

02:06:29.985 --> 02:06:31.018
MATT: 16 strength?

02:06:31.018 --> 02:06:32.246
LIAM: Yeah.

02:06:32.246 --> 02:06:35.239
MATT: Does it get a saving throw, you mean? A
strength saving throw?

02:06:35.239 --> 02:06:41.528
LIAM: "On a failed save, the target must make a
strength saving throw." Versus my 16.

02:06:41.528 --> 02:06:44.447
MATT: That is an eight. No.

02:06:44.447 --> 02:06:45.727
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:06:45.727 --> 02:06:48.154
(meowing)

02:06:48.154 --> 02:06:49.722
MATT: It is currently restrained, right?

02:06:49.722 --> 02:06:53.947
LIAM: And it takes 2d6 damage. Bludgeoning
damage.

02:06:53.947 --> 02:06:55.471
MATT: Go for it.

02:06:55.471 --> 02:07:00.015
LIAM: Five points of bludgeoning damage.

02:07:00.015 --> 02:07:02.677
LAURA: That's a really big cat paw.

02:07:02.677 --> 02:07:03.770
LIAM: It's so big.

02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:05.902
MATT: Yeah, it's gargantuan. All right, how much
damage was that?

02:07:05.902 --> 02:07:07.029
LIAM: Six total.

02:07:07.029 --> 02:07:07.990
MATT: Six total damage.

02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:12.325
LIAM: So a big muddy claw sinks into its tail and
pulls it down in place.

02:07:12.325 --> 02:07:20.974
MATT: At which point it's holding its staff still
and (hissing), spins its arm around. A level two

02:07:20.974 --> 02:07:26.708
Thunderwave bursts out in front of it in a 15-foot
cube, hitting both Beau and Caleb. I need you both

02:07:26.708 --> 02:07:28.876
to make a constitution saving throw, please.

02:07:28.876 --> 02:07:32.440
LIAM: The damage doesn't do anything to its
spellcasting ability, does it?

02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:33.468
MATT: No.

02:07:33.468 --> 02:07:34.907
LIAM: Okay. So what do I take?

02:07:34.907 --> 02:07:36.399
MATT: A constitution saving throw.

02:07:36.399 --> 02:07:39.246
MARISHA: 17 for me.

02:07:39.246 --> 02:07:41.443
MATT: That is a success, so you take half damage.

02:07:41.443 --> 02:07:43.372
LIAM: I'm not going to make this. Eight.

02:07:43.372 --> 02:07:52.558
MATT: Nope. That is 17 points of thunder damage.
You take half of that, so you take eight.

02:07:52.558 --> 02:07:55.767
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, just Caleb. She's still up.

02:07:55.767 --> 02:07:56.932
LIAM: Yeah, I'm out.

02:07:56.932 --> 02:07:57.901
MATT: You're still up?

02:07:57.901 --> 02:07:58.862
MARISHA: I'm still up.

02:07:58.862 --> 02:08:00.110
SAM: Cat's Paw's gone.

02:08:00.110 --> 02:08:08.847
MATT: Cat's Paw's gone. Caleb's unconscious. Easy
come, easy go. Beau, you are thrown ten feet back

02:08:08.847 --> 02:08:15.454
into the wall there as the smoke dissipates from
the Thunderwave. Wham! Into the wall and fall to

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:21.275
one knee. Let's see. No, that's all of its
movement. It took all of its movement to get

02:08:21.275 --> 02:08:25.871
there, so that's where it stands. That's going to
end its turn. Beau.

02:08:25.871 --> 02:08:27.933
MARISHA: Okay.

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:32.534
TRAVIS: Turn this man into fish sticks.

02:08:32.534 --> 02:08:35.177
MARISHA: (grunts) I'm a little out of-- it knocked
the wind out of me.

02:08:35.177 --> 02:08:38.440
MATT: Oh, it has to make a constitution saving
throw to see if it maintains the thunderstorm

02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:41.857
above. Which it succeeds.

02:08:41.857 --> 02:08:54.672
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to go for this mother.
I'm going to run up towards it, once again parkour

02:08:54.672 --> 02:09:02.516
off of that little-- yeah, and give a nice flying
Superman punch and then an uppercut.

02:09:02.516 --> 02:09:04.416
MATT: Go for it.

02:09:04.416 --> 02:09:09.585
MARISHA: First hit. All right, I'll take that 21.

02:09:09.585 --> 02:09:11.939
MATT: You're technically in the water, so the
attacks are at disadvantage.

02:09:11.939 --> 02:09:16.637
MARISHA: Okay. 16.

02:09:16.637 --> 02:09:18.303
MATT: 16 still hits.

02:09:18.303 --> 02:09:21.157
MARISHA: That's ten damage.

02:09:21.157 --> 02:09:22.781
MATT: Ten damage. Got it.

02:09:22.781 --> 02:09:27.985
MARISHA: Second attack. 16 for the first one. 16
again total.

02:09:27.985 --> 02:09:30.077
MATT: All right, that hits again. Second attack.

02:09:30.077 --> 02:09:33.029
MARISHA: 12 damage.

02:09:33.029 --> 02:09:39.946
MATT: 12 damage. Two constitution saving throws.
That's a success, and a success, so it's still

02:09:39.946 --> 02:09:42.130
maintaining concentration on the lightning storm.

02:09:42.130 --> 02:09:47.607
MARISHA: And bonus attack. Not good. Nine to hit.

02:09:47.607 --> 02:09:52.704
MATT: It swings wide. It's laughing under its
hissing breath as you're punching, and it's

02:09:52.704 --> 02:09:57.328
starting to try and slowly submerge into the
water.

02:09:57.328 --> 02:10:02.497
MARISHA: (panting) I'm losing steam. That's my
turn.

02:10:02.497 --> 02:10:05.144
MATT: That brings us to Jester.

02:10:05.144 --> 02:10:09.009
LAURA: I'm going to run to the other side of
Beau.

02:10:09.009 --> 02:10:11.820
MATT: Right here?

02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:15.472
LAURA: Yeah, so I'm flanking it.

02:10:15.472 --> 02:10:16.667
MATT: Over here, you mean?

02:10:16.667 --> 02:10:20.354
LAURA: Yeah. I wouldn't be able to hit it from the
land, would I?

02:10:20.354 --> 02:10:26.261
MATT: (counting) That's where you are, but you're
in the water right now. You're (splashing).

02:10:26.261 --> 02:10:27.592
LAURA: Okay, so I would get a straight attack,
right?

02:10:27.592 --> 02:10:28.650
MATT: Yes, you would.

02:10:28.650 --> 02:10:31.324
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try to hit it with a
level three Inflict Wounds.

02:10:31.324 --> 02:10:33.047
MATT: Go for it. You have disadvantage.

02:10:33.047 --> 02:10:34.828
LAURA: Well, a straight because it's flanked.

02:10:34.828 --> 02:10:39.777
MATT: You're flanking it, so it's a straight
attack, yes. You pull back (energy crackling).

02:10:39.777 --> 02:10:43.528
LAURA: That's 11.

02:10:43.528 --> 02:10:50.258
MATT: (fizzling) You reach up and right as you--
The dice are not with you. I'm so sorry, Laura.

02:10:50.258 --> 02:10:51.503
I'm so sorry.

02:10:51.503 --> 02:10:53.011
LAURA: No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:56.520
SAM: These dice are wrong and bad dice and they
should be put away forever.

02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:02.595
MATT: As you reach out with this crackling bolt of
looming necrotic energy, it manages to spin around

02:11:02.595 --> 02:11:08.230
and a burst of wind immediately pushes your arm
just off course and it releases harmlessly in the

02:11:08.230 --> 02:11:10.103
air. I'm sorry.

02:11:10.103 --> 02:11:12.430
LIAM: At least you got an apology when you rolled
shit.

02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:18.098
LAURA: Yeah, cool. I'm going to use Spiritual
Weapon at level two and then try to slam it down.

02:11:18.098 --> 02:11:19.843
MATT: All right, roll for the attack on it.

02:11:19.843 --> 02:11:25.949
LAURA: It's a level three Spiritual Weapon. It's a
natural one.

02:11:25.949 --> 02:11:28.984
MATT: You cast it at level two earlier though. I'm
so sorry.

02:11:28.984 --> 02:11:30.471
LAURA: No, I cast Spiritual Weapon at level
three.

02:11:30.471 --> 02:11:32.490
MATT: No, it was level two at the beginning.

02:11:32.490 --> 02:11:34.996
LAURA: No, I didn't. I cast it at level three. I
did.

02:11:34.996 --> 02:11:36.721
MARISHA: We all went, "Whoa! Level three!"

02:11:36.721 --> 02:11:40.596
TALIESIN: Yeah, there was a "whoa" there. We will
all get yelled at on the internet if we're wrong.

02:11:40.596 --> 02:11:43.971
LAURA: Yes, it's three. It was level three. It
doesn't matter. I rolled a one.

02:11:43.971 --> 02:11:45.503
MATT: I trust you guys.

02:11:45.503 --> 02:11:51.752
ASHLEY: But for next time, when you kill it and
get a How Do You Want To Do This with it. Just in case.

02:11:51.752 --> 02:11:54.308
MARISHA: How do you want to sweet tooth this?

02:11:54.308 --> 02:11:56.376
LAURA: That's all I can do.

02:11:56.427 --> 02:11:59.822
MATT: Sorry, Jester. That finishes your turn.
Caleb, I need you to make a death saving throw, please.

02:11:59.882 --> 02:12:03.601
LIAM: Sure. Let's do this. That's a six.

02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:06.259
MATT: That's a failure. First failed save on
Caleb.

02:12:06.259 --> 02:12:09.086
MATT: All right. Molly, you have a turn now.

02:12:09.086 --> 02:12:11.017
TALIESIN: Yes, I do.

02:12:11.017 --> 02:12:15.738
LAURA: Yeah, laugh. Laugh it up. I'm pregnant!

02:12:15.738 --> 02:12:19.809
(laughter)

02:12:19.809 --> 02:12:23.941
TALIESIN: Is it possible to make a leap across
some of water at the very least to try and get

02:12:23.983 --> 02:12:25.028
back to land?

02:12:25.028 --> 02:12:26.144
MATT: Make an athletics check.

02:12:26.144 --> 02:12:27.362
MARISHA: A woman scorned by her dice.

02:12:27.362 --> 02:12:29.734
TRAVIS: I know. I only see that at home.

02:12:29.734 --> 02:12:31.352
TALIESIN: That's a ten?

02:12:31.352 --> 02:12:39.796
MATT: No. You go (splashing) (counting) 30.

02:12:39.796 --> 02:12:45.512
TALIESIN: I'm going to also then use my action to
dash.

02:12:45.596 --> 02:12:49.773
MATT: (counting) 20. You get up there.

02:12:49.773 --> 02:12:51.430
TALIESIN: And I'm within range?

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:53.166
MATT: Combat range, yes.

02:12:53.166 --> 02:12:54.587
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action--

02:12:54.587 --> 02:12:57.184
MATT: You can only use your bonus action to attack
if you've used your action to attack.

02:12:57.184 --> 02:13:01.165
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. Wait. Double check,
because I thought that's just using my off-hand.

02:13:01.165 --> 02:13:04.354
MATT: That's what I'm thinking, but I'll double
check what the rules are there.

02:13:04.354 --> 02:13:06.431
TALIESIN: That's okay, I've got options. Sort of.

02:13:06.431 --> 02:13:08.536
MATT: Every now and then you need a reminder,
folks.

02:13:08.536 --> 02:13:16.113
SAM: Did Laura go to deliver the baby right now?

02:13:16.113 --> 02:13:17.472
TRAVIS: Yeah, just real quick.

02:13:17.472 --> 02:13:19.830
MATT: "When you take the Attack action and attack
with a light melee weapon that you're holding in

02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:23.355
"one hand, you can use a bonus action--" If you
don't attack, you cannot bonus action attack.

02:13:23.355 --> 02:13:28.721
TALIESIN: Okay. That's fine. I'm going to try
something weird, hold on. Since that's not going

02:13:28.721 --> 02:13:38.643
to work, can I take Enthrall? I'm going to take
Enthrall. I'm going to try and use Enthrall.

02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:42.506
MATT: Is it an action or a bonus action to use?
Because you've used your action this turn.

02:13:42.506 --> 02:13:44.976
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's true. I'm trying to see.

02:13:44.976 --> 02:13:46.510
MATT: I believe Enthrall as a spell is an action.

02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:48.379
TALIESIN: It might be it. Yeah, it's an action,
never mind. Vicious Mockery.

02:13:48.379 --> 02:13:50.106
MATT: Vicious Mockery, I believe, is also an
action.

02:13:50.106 --> 02:13:54.008
TALIESIN: Oh my god, everything is an action. I
have no bonus actions or anything reasonable that

02:13:54.008 --> 02:13:55.207
I can do.

02:13:55.207 --> 02:13:56.706
MATT: But you're in melee.

02:13:56.706 --> 02:13:58.498
TALIESIN: I'm in melee. That's fine.

02:13:58.498 --> 02:14:01.278
MATT: That ends your turn, Molly. Nott.

02:14:01.278 --> 02:14:11.131
SAM: Seeing my friend Caleb down, I'm filled with
a mighty rage and I will draw my crossbow, load my

02:14:11.131 --> 02:14:14.696
Burning Bolt, and run at it screaming and
firing.

02:14:14.696 --> 02:14:23.504
MATT: (counting) It's within 20 feet. As you're
running out of the water, (screaming)

02:14:23.504 --> 02:14:25.035
(splashing).

02:14:25.035 --> 02:14:26.921
SAM: That's a 20 to hit?

02:14:26.921 --> 02:14:30.108
MATT: That hits. Roll damage with the additional
Burning Bolt.

02:14:30.108 --> 02:14:50.168
SAM: (counting) Fury of the Small, 21, plus the
Burning Bolt is another three. 24 total?

02:14:50.168 --> 02:14:51.452
MATT: 24 points of damage.

02:14:51.452 --> 02:14:52.934
SAM: On the first hit.

02:14:52.934 --> 02:14:58.420
MATT: It has to make a constitution saving throw
to see if it maintains. No, it does not. It drops

02:14:58.420 --> 02:14:59.708
the lightning.

02:14:59.708 --> 02:15:01.765
TALIESIN: That alone.

02:15:01.765 --> 02:15:04.045
MARISHA: That will keep Caleb alive.

02:15:04.045 --> 02:15:06.176
SAM: Is it still alive?

02:15:06.176 --> 02:15:08.314
MATT: Yeah. Next attack.

02:15:08.314 --> 02:15:11.376
SAM: Bonus action, shot. 22 to hit?

02:15:11.376 --> 02:15:12.938
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:15:12.938 --> 02:15:16.285
SAM: It's just one now. Another eight points.

02:15:16.285 --> 02:15:18.266
MATT: The shallow priest is looking hurt.

02:15:18.266 --> 02:15:19.856
MARISHA: Shallow priest?

02:15:19.856 --> 02:15:21.324
MATT: It's a merrow shallow priest.

02:15:21.324 --> 02:15:26.192
TALIESIN: Very shallow. Really hot Instagram
account, though.

02:15:26.192 --> 02:15:27.711
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Nott?

02:15:27.711 --> 02:15:28.716
SAM: That's it.

02:15:28.716 --> 02:15:30.034
MATT: Fjord.

02:15:30.034 --> 02:15:39.170
TRAVIS: I'll reappear ten feet closer to Jester.
Yep. And I'll unleash two Eldritch Blasts.

02:15:39.170 --> 02:15:41.066
MATT: Ten feet right there.

02:15:41.066 --> 02:15:42.597
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Beach priest.

02:15:42.597 --> 02:15:45.531
TRAVIS: That's not going to hit. That's a ten.

02:15:45.531 --> 02:15:47.539
MATT: Goes wide, strikes a nearby rock.

02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:50.495
TRAVIS: And that's a 14 on the dot.

02:15:50.495 --> 02:15:51.579
MATT: 14 misses.

02:15:51.579 --> 02:15:52.653
TRAVIS: Oh, it does, that's right.

02:15:52.653 --> 02:15:56.120
MATT: This one has higher armor than the rest. As
you release both bolts, it's flailing around, hurt

02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:59.726
after taking the impact from the bolts. You can see
the burst of flame on its back from the shot it

02:15:59.726 --> 02:16:05.173
took from Nott, and as it lurches forward, it
manages to arc out of the way of your bolt. No

02:16:05.219 --> 02:16:06.248
impact.

02:16:06.248 --> 02:16:07.434
TRAVIS: Oh, roll to see--

02:16:07.434 --> 02:16:08.828
MATT: Roll to see if you stick around.

02:16:08.828 --> 02:16:11.450
TRAVIS: I disappear. (bamfing noise)

02:16:11.450 --> 02:16:17.294
MARISHA: Oh god! You're cutting out, Fjord, I
can't--

02:16:17.294 --> 02:16:19.096
TRAVIS: You guys are doing good-- (bamfing noise).

02:16:19.096 --> 02:16:20.589
TALIESIN: Take ten feet to the right. I can't--

02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:23.186
MATT: Lag spikes are rough when you're on a
raid, guys.

02:16:23.238 --> 02:16:26.645
LIAM: This is like those Tatasciore spells. Like
(mimics cutting out).

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:28.186
MATT: Top of the round. Yasha, you're up.

02:16:28.186 --> 02:16:38.975
ASHLEY: I'm going to go around to-- Can I flank
him? Behind or somewheres?

02:16:38.975 --> 02:16:41.187
LIAM: Front of Molly.

02:16:41.187 --> 02:16:46.884
MATT: Right now? No, the space right there where
technically it is-- I'll say you can get up on

02:16:46.884 --> 02:16:51.334
there, sure. Using all your movement, you can get
on there. It's a little wobbly.

02:16:51.347 --> 02:16:56.703
ASHLEY: Then, you know, attack.

02:16:56.703 --> 02:17:03.926
MATT: No. Hold on, Beau was in the water. This
technically is not a space you can get on. You

02:17:03.926 --> 02:17:13.011
would not be able to flank with it. You can get
there if you want to. Because this is in the space.

02:17:13.011 --> 02:17:14.678
ASHLEY: It's not considered flanking?

02:17:14.678 --> 02:17:17.001
MATT: No, because you have to be on the exact
opposite. That space is currently occupied by the

02:17:17.001 --> 02:17:18.174
stalagmite.

02:17:18.174 --> 02:17:20.300
ASHLEY: That's fine. Okay.

02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:22.186
MATT: You're in the water, so disadvantage on your
attacks.

02:17:22.186 --> 02:17:23.497
ASHLEY: Disadvantage. Okay.

02:17:23.497 --> 02:17:25.212
LAURA: I didn't even realize I was sitting here
like---

02:17:25.212 --> 02:17:26.779
ASHLEY: 18.

02:17:26.779 --> 02:17:28.069
MATT: 18 hits.

02:17:28.069 --> 02:17:30.417
MARISHA: It's like this little dark cloud right
over you.

02:17:30.417 --> 02:17:32.749
TRAVIS: Come on, Yasha.

02:17:32.749 --> 02:17:34.459
LAURA: Kill it, Yasha.

02:17:34.459 --> 02:17:36.055
ASHLEY: I'm going to try.

02:17:36.055 --> 02:17:37.406
LIAM: That's what you do.

02:17:37.406 --> 02:17:38.484
ASHLEY: Nine.

02:17:38.484 --> 02:17:39.685
LIAM: Yasha.

02:17:39.685 --> 02:17:40.874
TRAVIS: Nein!

02:17:40.874 --> 02:17:44.373
ASHLEY: 12 for the first hit.

02:17:44.373 --> 02:17:45.655
MATT: Nice.

02:17:45.655 --> 02:17:50.483
LIAM: Come on, buddy.

02:17:50.483 --> 02:17:54.655
ASHLEY: Okay. 20?

02:17:54.655 --> 02:17:56.641
MATT: 20 hits. Roll damage for your second
strike.

02:17:56.641 --> 02:18:02.675
ASHLEY: 12.

02:18:02.675 --> 02:18:09.242
MATT: 12 points of damage. It is so close. It is
hurt so bad. As you slash twice, in the water, you

02:18:09.242 --> 02:18:15.128
see these large arcs of stale, stagnant cave water
splashing in the air with this gleaming blade as

02:18:15.128 --> 02:18:20.272
Yasha's tearing into it. The pool around it is
turning dark purple as its blood is seeping in and

02:18:20.272 --> 02:18:24.768
it's looking desperately around for some means of
escape. That end your turn, Yasha?

02:18:24.768 --> 02:18:29.408
ASHLEY: Yeah. I don't think I can't do anything
else.

02:18:29.408 --> 02:18:31.280
MATT: It's now the shallow priest's turn.

02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:34.342
LAURA: Oh no. Thunderwave.

02:18:34.342 --> 02:18:37.315
SAM: Oh no, you're all grouped together.

02:18:37.315 --> 02:18:41.678
MATT: Yeah. That's what it's going to do. Level
two Thunderwave.

02:18:41.678 --> 02:18:44.410
LIAM: Would Caleb have flown backwards when he was
struck before?

02:18:44.410 --> 02:18:45.734
MATT: Hmm?

02:18:45.734 --> 02:18:49.341
LIAM: When Caleb was knocked down by Thunderwave
the first time, would he have been thrown

02:18:49.341 --> 02:18:50.464
backwards?

02:18:50.464 --> 02:18:53.012
MATT: It would have thrown you back into the wall.
There's nowhere more for you to push this way.

02:18:53.012 --> 02:18:54.291
LIAM: Oh, I thought--

02:18:54.291 --> 02:18:55.968
SAM: Oh no. Is he within the cube?

02:18:55.968 --> 02:18:57.912
TALIESIN: Well, it depends where the cube goes.

02:18:57.912 --> 02:19:04.832
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a direction. It's not a cube
around you, it's a-- you have to shoot it.

02:19:04.832 --> 02:19:11.849
TRAVIS: It's shallow priest discretion. What will
he do? Look as the DM muddles his choices.

02:19:11.849 --> 02:19:17.304
Considers consequences. Plans his retribution.

02:19:17.304 --> 02:19:19.455
SAM: Decides to kill Liam forever.

02:19:19.455 --> 02:19:21.535
TALIESIN: If he wants to escape, he's got to knock
us all back.

02:19:21.535 --> 02:19:29.765
TRAVIS: As his hair dangles beautifully in front
of his face. Thinks-- (singing) I'm in another

02:19:29.765 --> 02:19:31.438
dimension!

02:19:31.438 --> 02:19:37.355
MARISHA: Doing the Charleston.

02:19:37.355 --> 02:19:47.506
MATT: The placement here makes it a little hairy.
It's going to go ahead and--

02:19:47.506 --> 02:19:56.082
SAM: That's only three squares, right?

02:19:56.082 --> 02:20:01.651
MATT: It's a fifteen-foot cube. In front of you.
And it's trying to-- Yeah, you guys are positioned

02:20:01.651 --> 02:20:03.765
in such a way where it--

02:20:03.765 --> 02:20:09.426
SAM: It doesn't have to be in front of you.
It says in any direction.

02:20:09.499 --> 02:20:12.516
MATT: Well yeah, but you can't be part of a cube,
and I'm trying to figure out what would be the

02:20:12.516 --> 02:20:14.957
most optimal way for it to use it. I'm going to
say--

02:20:14.957 --> 02:20:20.170
TALIESIN: It's going to be the two of us, I think.
Yeah, that's my money.

02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:25.297
MATT: No, the ones who are hurt the most are Beau
and Yasha and they've been the biggest problem for

02:20:25.297 --> 02:20:35.496
these guys. It's not too worried about the other
two. 15-foot cube. Okay. All right, you know what?

02:20:35.496 --> 02:20:44.213
It's going to go ahead and attempt to shift this
way one square, into the space with the Spiritual

02:20:44.213 --> 02:20:45.274
Weapon.

02:20:45.274 --> 02:20:46.637
TALIESIN: So it gets an attack of opportunity
from--

02:20:46.637 --> 02:20:47.733
MATT: From Yasha.

02:20:47.733 --> 02:20:48.897
LAURA: And from Jester.

02:20:48.897 --> 02:20:52.087
MATT: And from Jester. Both of you guys, make an
attack. With disadvantage for you, Yasha. It's

02:20:52.087 --> 02:20:55.299
risky on its endeavor, but it's what's going to
give it an opportunity to try and get out of this

02:20:55.299 --> 02:20:56.538
lockdown.

02:20:56.538 --> 02:20:57.678
ASHLEY: It hits.

02:20:57.678 --> 02:20:58.656
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:20:58.656 --> 02:21:00.845
ASHLEY: I rolled a 16 and a 21.

02:21:00.845 --> 02:21:02.424
MATT: Okay, 16 hits.

02:21:02.424 --> 02:21:03.832
ASHLEY: That's just a regular attack.

02:21:03.832 --> 02:21:04.784
MATT: Yeah, regular attack.

02:21:04.784 --> 02:21:05.789
LAURA: I rolled a 15.

02:21:05.789 --> 02:21:06.666
MATT: 15 just hits.

02:21:06.666 --> 02:21:10.069
TRAVIS: So if you hit with your Sentinel does that
mean its speed is reduced to zero?

02:21:10.069 --> 02:21:16.921
MATT: Yep. It can't move. So with Sentinel, it
does not get a chance to move as you arc towards

02:21:16.921 --> 02:21:18.380
it. How much damage did you do?

02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:19.311
ASHLEY: Nine.

02:21:19.311 --> 02:21:20.211
MATT: Nine.

02:21:20.211 --> 02:21:20.957
LAURA: Five.

02:21:20.957 --> 02:21:21.994
MATT: Five. How do you two want to do this?

02:21:21.994 --> 02:21:23.952
(cheering)

02:21:23.952 --> 02:21:28.514
LAURA: I go low, you go high?

02:21:28.514 --> 02:21:29.589
ASHLEY: Yeah!

02:21:29.589 --> 02:21:31.354
LAURA: All right. I go low with the handaxe.

02:21:31.354 --> 02:21:35.941
MATT: Okay. So as you swing with the handaxe and
you swing with the sword as it backs away,

02:21:35.941 --> 02:21:40.544
charging the energy of the Thunderwave in its
hands, it tries to slink through the water, the

02:21:40.544 --> 02:21:45.634
blade of your handaxe carves into its throat from
this side (painful grunt). At which point the

02:21:45.634 --> 02:21:49.935
blade hits from this side (slurp). And like a
terrible scene out of Riki-Oh, because I have not

02:21:49.935 --> 02:21:54.275
used that reference in this campaign, the body
gets split in two sides and you watch as it falls

02:21:54.275 --> 02:21:59.062
to the ground in three separate pieces, (thuds)
all sinking beneath the water below.

02:21:59.062 --> 02:22:00.157
ASHLEY: See ya!

02:22:00.157 --> 02:22:01.332
TRAVIS: Wouldn't want to be ya!

02:22:01.332 --> 02:22:04.495
ASHLEY: Oh my god. Can we grab some of the stuff
before he goes into the water?

02:22:04.495 --> 02:22:06.932
SAM: You're looting him before he--

02:22:06.932 --> 02:22:09.546
ASHLEY: Yeah, before he sinks down.

02:22:09.546 --> 02:22:11.312
LIAM: Should I make another death save?

02:22:11.312 --> 02:22:13.766
MATT: Yes you do, Caleb. That's cocked.

02:22:13.766 --> 02:22:15.814
LIAM: That's an 11.

02:22:15.814 --> 02:22:16.931
MATT: Okay.

02:22:16.931 --> 02:22:19.113
LAURA: I go-- Are we still in initiative order?

02:22:19.113 --> 02:22:21.283
MATT: Right now, at this point, there is no
threat.

02:22:21.283 --> 02:22:24.981
TRAVIS: Can I Blink back in and go, stop!

02:22:24.981 --> 02:22:27.497
MATT: Yes. You drop the spell.

02:22:27.497 --> 02:22:29.187
TRAVIS: (panting)

02:22:29.187 --> 02:22:31.630
LAURA: I'm going to Cure Wounds Caleb.

02:22:31.630 --> 02:22:35.905
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and heal up for that.

02:22:35.905 --> 02:22:41.465
LAURA: I'm going to be so pissed off though, about
nothing working. I'm just going to touch him with

02:22:41.465 --> 02:22:42.652
my toes.

02:22:42.652 --> 02:22:44.305
(laughter)

02:22:44.305 --> 02:22:48.134
MATT: The last slab of its flesh that you had
carved from its head and shoulder area you push

02:22:48.134 --> 02:22:49.997
into the water, kicking it forward.

02:22:49.997 --> 02:22:51.767
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 12 points of healing.

02:22:51.767 --> 02:22:53.463
MATT: So, Caleb, you heal 12 hit points.

02:22:53.463 --> 02:22:58.749
LIAM: Thank you. (groans) Ow.

02:22:58.749 --> 02:23:01.839
SAM: Not attractive.

02:23:01.839 --> 02:23:03.676
TRAVIS: Can I make my way over and up the steps?

02:23:03.676 --> 02:23:04.983
TALIESIN: I'll join you.

02:23:04.983 --> 02:23:09.578
MATT: We'll say as you guys gather to go ahead and
deal with the aftermath of this battle, we're

02:23:09.578 --> 02:23:10.676
going to take a break.

02:23:10.676 --> 02:23:11.682
(cheering)

02:23:11.682 --> 02:23:17.473
MATT: Because there is time to take a break. We'll
be back here in just a little bit, guys.

02:23:17.473 --> 02:23:20.247
TRAVIS: Good shit, man. Good shit.

02:23:20.247 --> 02:23:22.235
MARISHA: Look, there's condensation on the map.

02:23:22.235 --> 02:23:23.744
LAURA: I know, it's really cool.

02:23:23.744 --> 02:23:27.362
MATT: Apologies for the humming of the motor from
earlier. This is the first time trying it out.

02:23:27.362 --> 02:23:32.114
Didn't really need it. It was fine. But yes, so.
We'll be back here in a few minutes, guys. We'll

02:23:32.114 --> 02:23:34.365
see you in a little bit.

02:23:37.305 --> 02:23:42.099
MATT: Welcome back, everybody! Carefully clapping,
so not to clap too much.

02:23:42.099 --> 02:23:45.871
LIAM: No, you got to just do this.

02:23:45.871 --> 02:23:49.793
MATT: Hi everyone. Welcome back. Before we jump
into the story, real fast, we wanted to say a quick

02:23:49.793 --> 02:23:54.358
hello from a friend of ours who stopped by the
office and tonight's studio to say hello. Babs

02:23:54.358 --> 02:24:01.221
Tarr, the very, extremely talented comic book
artist for many different comic series. Incredibly

02:24:01.221 --> 02:24:04.848
talented and is very much a Critter along with us
and stopped in to say hi!

02:24:04.848 --> 02:24:06.295
BABS: Thanks for having me, guys!

02:24:06.295 --> 02:24:08.780
MATT: Of course, thanks for coming by! Where can
they find you?

02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:13.830
BABS: Oh, babsbabsbabs.com or @babsdraws on
Instagram and Twitter. Check it out, guys!

02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:15.445
LIAM: Check out her book, Motor Crush!

02:24:15.445 --> 02:24:19.315
BABS: Thank you! Yes, Motor Crush Volume 2 just
came out, so check it out.

02:24:19.315 --> 02:24:21.433
MARISHA: And your nails are amazing.

02:24:21.433 --> 02:24:24.117
MATT: Thank you, Babs.

02:24:24.117 --> 02:24:25.540
BABS: Bye, guys!

02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:27.217
ASHLEY: She did that and I was like, ooh!

02:24:27.217 --> 02:24:29.020
MARISHA: So blue!

02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:37.011
MATT: Picking up where we left off. You guys rush
to pull Caleb off the ground. You're all beaten,

02:24:37.011 --> 02:24:38.331
battered--

02:24:38.331 --> 02:24:42.517
MARISHA: I'm standing right there, so I'll get you
up.

02:24:42.517 --> 02:24:48.354
LAURA: I'm going to use my Pearl of Power to
regain a 3rd-level spell and then I'm going to use

02:24:48.354 --> 02:24:56.380
Prayer of Healing on everyone. So everyone I can
see within my range. So everybody get within 30

02:24:56.380 --> 02:25:00.830
feet of me! I'll do 3d8 of healing for everybody.

02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:02.521
SAM: Wow!

02:25:02.521 --> 02:25:09.208
LAURA: Seriously? (shouting) Seriously!

02:25:09.208 --> 02:25:11.789
TRAVIS: Think of the baby! Stay calm.

02:25:11.789 --> 02:25:13.360
LIAM: A one, a one, and a two.

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:14.619
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

02:25:14.619 --> 02:25:15.902
MATT: Laura.

02:25:15.902 --> 02:25:20.799
LAURA: (shrieks through gritted teeth) So eight
points of healing, you guys, for that level three spell.

02:25:20.799 --> 02:25:22.929
ASHLEY: Okay, but that's still--

02:25:22.929 --> 02:25:27.651
SAM: I didn't even need it because I wasn't hurt
at all in the fight.

02:25:27.651 --> 02:25:29.210
MARISHA: Can I take your eight points?

02:25:29.210 --> 02:25:30.550
TRAVIS: Seven points of healing?

02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:31.681
MATT: Eight points of healing.

02:25:31.681 --> 02:25:33.300
ASHLEY: I'll take it.

02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:36.084
LAURA: (muffled shrieking)

02:25:36.084 --> 02:25:37.794
SAM: The baby can hear all of this.

02:25:37.794 --> 02:25:40.020
LAURA: This game's going to make me go into
labor!

02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:42.836
MARISHA: What if it does, you guys?

02:25:42.836 --> 02:25:44.839
MATT: No, we need her for as long as we can keep
her.

02:25:44.839 --> 02:25:47.226
MARISHA: That'd be so magical.

02:25:47.226 --> 02:25:48.953
LAURA: I'm not really mad. I'm fine.

02:25:48.953 --> 02:25:51.489
SAM: Roll for dilation.

02:25:51.489 --> 02:25:54.252
TRAVIS: Roll low.

02:25:54.252 --> 02:26:00.834
MATT: Anyway. Your wounds close up a bit through
the incantation.

02:26:00.834 --> 02:26:02.262
LAURA: The smallest amount.

02:26:02.262 --> 02:26:03.843
LIAM: You look pretty bad.

02:26:03.843 --> 02:26:05.665
MARISHA: You look pretty shitty, too.

02:26:05.665 --> 02:26:06.591
LIAM: I'm good.

02:26:06.591 --> 02:26:08.672
MARISHA: Your shave is still very nice, though.

02:26:08.672 --> 02:26:19.438
LIAM: What's that stuff up there? I'm going to
start hobbling towards the bottom of the stony steps.

02:26:19.438 --> 02:26:20.618
SAM: I'll help him.

02:26:20.618 --> 02:26:22.749
MARISHA: Caleb, do you-- yeah, all right.

02:26:22.749 --> 02:26:24.799
LAURA: Check for traps, you guys!

02:26:24.799 --> 02:26:32.922
SAM: Oh, okay! I can do that. Are there any boxes
or treasure chests?

02:26:32.922 --> 02:26:37.537
MATT: You see remnants of crates and broken goods
littered across the rough staircase, now that you

02:26:37.537 --> 02:26:42.273
take a moment to inspect it. Make an investigation
check if you want to glance about the space.

02:26:42.273 --> 02:26:43.780
SAM: With disadvantage!

02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:46.588
MATT: Yes, because you are drunk.

02:26:46.588 --> 02:26:47.870
SAM: That's an eight.

02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:55.497
MATT: You find some broken pieces of pottery, it
seems like. Nice, polished on one side, with a

02:26:55.497 --> 02:26:56.789
nice glaze.

02:26:56.789 --> 02:26:57.933
SAM: I'll take those.

02:26:57.933 --> 02:27:03.368
MATT: You can write down in your inventory "broken
pieces of shiny pottery." Fjord?

02:27:03.368 --> 02:27:06.961
TRAVIS: Can I pick up his big trident that has the
cord attached to it? Is it wrapped around his

02:27:06.961 --> 02:27:09.024
wrist, or anything? Is that how he was pulling
people?

02:27:09.024 --> 02:27:16.609
MATT: If you look at the trident, it looks like
it's a very tightly woven rope, but the individual

02:27:16.609 --> 02:27:21.568
threads of rope are treated like a leather-type
stat, so it's a really tight leather cord.

02:27:21.568 --> 02:27:24.263
TRAVIS: Is it attached to his person in some way?

02:27:24.263 --> 02:27:29.871
MATT: From what you can see, where it was dangling
from there, they're wrapped in a loose loop around

02:27:29.871 --> 02:27:33.141
the side of their armor, and when they throw it,
they catch the end of it and pull it back.

02:27:33.141 --> 02:27:36.559
TRAVIS: I'll take the trident and unhook it from
his armor.

02:27:36.559 --> 02:27:40.847
MATT: Okay. It's about 60 feet of leather cord, if
you want to call it that. Sturdy leather cord.

02:27:40.847 --> 02:27:48.390
It's heavy, so it's about twice the weight of hemp
rope. It's stronger, but it's heavier.

02:27:48.390 --> 02:27:49.519
TRAVIS: These guys were big.

02:27:49.519 --> 02:27:50.951
MATT: Yeah, they're pretty strong.

02:27:50.951 --> 02:27:54.207
MARISHA: Can I take a short rest while everyone's
doing this?

02:27:54.207 --> 02:27:57.345
MATT: If you guys want to take a short rest, if
you guys are inspecting the rest of the area.

02:27:57.345 --> 02:27:59.792
TRAVIS: Yeah, y'all look for shit. I'm going to
meditate for a hot second.

02:27:59.792 --> 02:28:03.354
SAM: If you're going to meditate, maybe go back
and check on the little bird?

02:28:03.354 --> 02:28:05.671
TRAVIS: Where did you leave her?

02:28:05.671 --> 02:28:15.199
SAM: I think she's okay, I left her in an
invisible-- I made a false rock.

02:28:15.199 --> 02:28:17.184
LAURA: I go into the water to look for her.

02:28:17.184 --> 02:28:23.230
MATT: Jester, as you come back into the next
chamber, you're looking around and there's no sign

02:28:23.230 --> 02:28:31.108
of Kiri. You see natural stone, the pool, a piece
of wall to the side, and there's no sign.

02:28:31.108 --> 02:28:38.428
LAURA: Oh no! She's been taken! Kiri! Kiri!

02:28:38.428 --> 02:28:42.403
MATT: (like Jester) "I'm Kiri!" You look around
and you don't see anything.

02:28:42.403 --> 02:28:44.651
LAURA: Kiri? Where are you? Are you invisible?

02:28:44.651 --> 02:28:46.288
MATT: (like Jester) "Yes, I'm very sweet!"

02:28:46.288 --> 02:28:54.684
LAURA: Oh, Kiri! I'm going to find you. Say
"warmer" or "colder," and I start walking around

02:28:54.684 --> 02:28:57.694
the room. Warmer?

02:28:57.694 --> 02:29:03.336
MATT: (like Jester) "Warmer?" You slowly start
making your way towards this weird cylindrical

02:29:03.336 --> 02:29:05.525
stone wall that you now realize wasn't there
before.

02:29:05.525 --> 02:29:07.425
LAURA: This is a weird-looking wall.

02:29:07.425 --> 02:29:12.580
MATT: You reach through and your hand goes right
into a tuft of feathers. (startled chirping)

02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:14.044
LAURA: Kiri!

02:29:14.044 --> 02:29:17.359
MATT: Kiri reaches up and grabs your hand, and you
pull her through the illusion. She steps out and

02:29:17.359 --> 02:29:19.608
goes, (like Cali) "I killed people!"

02:29:19.608 --> 02:29:27.274
LAURA: Good for you! I did too, just barely. It
was a bad day for me, Kiri.

02:29:27.274 --> 02:29:32.653
MATT: Kiri points to one of the bodies of the
merrow that you had killed the night before that's

02:29:32.653 --> 02:29:39.122
barely visible out of the water there. It looks
like it has a couple stab wounds to it, and Kiri's like--

02:29:39.122 --> 02:29:42.252
LAURA: Did you go stab a dead person?

02:29:42.252 --> 02:29:43.848
MATT: (chirping)

02:29:43.848 --> 02:29:50.562
LAURA: We should probably teach you that's not the
coolest thing to do, I don't think, but it's fine

02:29:50.562 --> 02:29:57.388
that you did it this time. I'm sure he didn't feel
it. But probably if we're in a place where other

02:29:57.388 --> 02:30:03.225
people are around, we probably shouldn't stab
people that are already hurt.

02:30:03.225 --> 02:30:05.254
MATT: (like Jester) "Okay, okay, okay."

02:30:05.254 --> 02:30:08.413
LAURA: I mean, no, that's a lie. Unless they are
attacking you. Don't stab people that are

02:30:08.413 --> 02:30:09.552
dead-dead.

02:30:09.552 --> 02:30:10.779
MATT: (like Jester) "Okay, okay, okay."

02:30:10.779 --> 02:30:11.967
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:30:11.967 --> 02:30:17.321
LIAM: I realize something in a panic and I trudge
through the water back towards the entrance and I

02:30:17.321 --> 02:30:22.134
pull out the wire and I put it in my hands and I
cast Message and say to Jester: Please, please,

02:30:22.134 --> 02:30:26.191
please get my books and put them in your bag,
please?

02:30:26.191 --> 02:30:28.453
LAURA: Okay.

02:30:28.453 --> 02:30:33.686
MATT: Make an investigation check, Jester.

02:30:33.686 --> 02:30:37.178
LAURA: Watch me roll a fucking 20 on this.

02:30:37.178 --> 02:30:38.889
TALIESIN: Oh god no.

02:30:38.889 --> 02:30:46.960
LAURA: Oh god no. That was cocked, and I just
moved it. Oh good, that's worse. Four.

02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:53.435
MATT: As you spend a moment searching around in
the middle of the dirt with no luck, there's a

02:30:53.435 --> 02:30:57.429
little knock on your shoulder with a pointed
finger. You glance over and Kiri has the book

02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:59.155
bundle, the leather strap--

02:30:59.155 --> 02:31:01.359
LAURA: Were you holding those the whole time?

02:31:01.359 --> 02:31:03.956
MATT: (chirping) Points to the side corner.

02:31:03.956 --> 02:31:14.966
LAURA: Put those books in this pink bag, okay? All
right.

02:31:14.966 --> 02:31:20.794
TRAVIS: Are there any stairways, or doors, or
gates, or anything that would lead upwards from

02:31:20.794 --> 02:31:22.642
this cavern?

02:31:22.642 --> 02:31:28.227
MATT: If you want to start inspecting the area: up
the stairs, there's a platform above where there's

02:31:28.227 --> 02:31:33.980
more of the boxes and crates and there's piles of
things gathered around some sort of rock

02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:40.067
formation, where that mist seems to be emanating
from, which is still loosely drifting off of the

02:31:40.067 --> 02:31:41.069
surface of the water.

02:31:41.069 --> 02:31:42.171
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take a closer look.

02:31:42.171 --> 02:31:44.932
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

02:31:44.932 --> 02:31:51.877
TRAVIS: 14.

02:31:51.877 --> 02:32:06.650
MATT: 14, okay. You can see scattered bits of gold
and silver and copper that have been lost amongst

02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:15.805
the steps here, some of them covered in dirt or
mud and can be cleaned and pulled out of there. As

02:32:15.805 --> 02:32:20.501
you ascend the steps, if anybody wants to join
Fjord as well? You go with him as well? You also

02:32:20.501 --> 02:32:26.154
see there's a bunch of silverware thrown around.
Very nice, fine silverware that is, in many cases,

02:32:26.154 --> 02:32:31.851
partially packed with more mud, sand, and whatever
grime is here. It looks like everything was

02:32:31.851 --> 02:32:40.501
brought here, and largely a number of it has been
discarded or left with no particular purpose. As

02:32:40.501 --> 02:32:43.927
you begin to pore through some of it, you see
there's a crate that's partially open. There's a

02:32:43.927 --> 02:32:50.100
cache of weapons in there that are bound in
clusters with leather straps around them. Looking

02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:56.633
there, there are four well-made longswords, four
well-made shortswords, two battleaxes, and two

02:32:56.633 --> 02:33:01.392
halberds that are part of this cache. They're
resting open on the inside of this open crate.

02:33:01.392 --> 02:33:16.257
There's a locked, dark wood case, about four feet
across and a foot wide, that is currently closed

02:33:16.257 --> 02:33:24.964
and latched. There's also a locked iron box that's
flat, a foot and a half by a foot and a half. It's

02:33:24.964 --> 02:33:36.198
simple, steel, iron look to it. Then there's the
stone formation that's about six to ten foot at

02:33:36.198 --> 02:33:41.018
different places. It's a bit oblong and strange.
It's not a perfect oval, but it's made to be this

02:33:41.018 --> 02:33:45.227
pool of water, where the mist is rising and
sifting out of it. Around the edges of it, there

02:33:45.227 --> 02:33:53.638
are dozens and dozens of metallic objects of
different shapes and configurations and designs.

02:33:53.638 --> 02:33:55.276
Make a religion check.

02:33:55.276 --> 02:34:01.679
TRAVIS: Natural 19, for 21.

02:34:01.679 --> 02:34:10.979
MATT: You recognize a majority of the iconography
here. It looks like one of these bundles-- one of

02:34:10.979 --> 02:34:16.773
these boxes that was gathered here-- was filled
with holy symbols and religious iconography, most

02:34:16.773 --> 02:34:25.496
of which appear to be deities that are outlawed by
the Empire. You see symbols and worship idols for

02:34:25.496 --> 02:34:32.940
the Archeart. You see some for Avandra, the
Changebringer. You see a number of Moonweaver holy

02:34:32.984 --> 02:34:38.551
symbols with the two crescent moons across the
silver cross. You see the hook and the wreath of

02:34:38.551 --> 02:34:43.823
the Wildmother, Melora, a number of those
scattered about, some in disrepair, with actual

02:34:43.823 --> 02:34:50.227
pieces of dried barley and other grains around it.
You see a number of symbols of Kord, the

02:34:50.227 --> 02:34:56.327
Stormlord. You see a handful for the Everlight.
There are a few more dubious symbols as well.

02:34:56.327 --> 02:35:01.642
There's one that looks like a dark, horned crown
that you recognize that is used to invoke

02:35:01.642 --> 02:35:10.989
Asmodeus, the Lord of the Hells. You see one that
looks like-- you only see a few of these, but it

02:35:10.989 --> 02:35:16.681
looks like a series of chains and shackles that
are across a coffin-like box, and you know that,

02:35:16.681 --> 02:35:24.849
because you rolled super high, to represent Bane,
the Strife Emperor, who is a deity of conquest.

02:35:24.849 --> 02:35:27.293
SAM: Let's hear it, Liam.

02:35:27.293 --> 02:35:29.934
LIAM: (Bane voice) "Your punishment will be more
severe."

02:35:29.934 --> 02:35:31.436
MATT: There it is.

02:35:31.436 --> 02:35:32.796
MARISHA: You were waiting for it!

02:35:32.796 --> 02:35:42.084
MATT: As well as the clawed hand on a number of
items that resemble Tiamat, the Scaled Tyrant.

02:35:42.084 --> 02:35:48.613
TRAVIS: You guys, come up here. There's a ton of
arms up here. There's battleaxes and swords, but

02:35:48.613 --> 02:35:51.623
there's all these trinkets and holy symbols.

02:35:51.623 --> 02:35:53.601
LIAM: Are you being careful up there?

02:35:53.601 --> 02:35:54.931
TRAVIS: Careful?

02:35:54.931 --> 02:36:00.889
LIAM: Yeah, you know. Nott could have a look
around, I could have a look around once Jester

02:36:00.889 --> 02:36:03.123
returns with my books.

02:36:03.123 --> 02:36:07.000
TRAVIS: Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind if you
check for magic. And Nott, actually, there's this

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.438
four-foot long box if you want to try and open her
up for me.

02:36:11.438 --> 02:36:13.182
MATT: Jester, you return. Did you take Kiri with
you?

02:36:13.182 --> 02:36:15.170
LAURA: I'll have her hold on to my belt as we
swim.

02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:16.372
SAM: Is it locked?

02:36:16.372 --> 02:36:17.896
TRAVIS: I think so. It looks to be latched shut in
some way.

02:36:17.896 --> 02:36:22.898
MATT: At this point, you hear a distant sound that
echoes through the wall (fluttering). You spin and

02:36:22.898 --> 02:36:26.735
look over and you can see Jester emerging from the
water and a little black bird that is currently

02:36:26.735 --> 02:36:29.781
fluttering to try to get the water off the
feathers.

02:36:29.781 --> 02:36:35.989
LIAM: I start speed wading back. (stuttering) Are
my books dry?

02:36:35.989 --> 02:36:40.357
LAURA: Oh yeah, I put them in my coat. Don't
worry, they're fine.

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:41.594
LIAM: But can I see them?

02:36:41.594 --> 02:36:44.835
LAURA: Yeah. Just kidding. They're in the bag.
Don't worry.

02:36:44.835 --> 02:36:47.732
LIAM: Are they dry?

02:36:47.732 --> 02:36:48.724
MATT: They're dry.

02:36:48.724 --> 02:36:49.910
LIAM: They're dry. Okay.

02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:51.274
MATT: Nott, what were you looking at?

02:36:51.274 --> 02:36:52.810
SAM: There's a locked box?

02:36:52.810 --> 02:36:54.478
TRAVIS: The four-foot long one.

02:36:54.478 --> 02:36:55.774
MATT: Yeah, there's two boxes.

02:36:55.774 --> 02:36:56.915
SAM: Two boxes?

02:36:56.915 --> 02:36:58.044
TRAVIS: The iron one and the wooden one.

02:36:58.044 --> 02:37:07.409
LIAM: I recommend that you allow me to check for
magical problems. Then once we know what's what,

02:37:07.409 --> 02:37:10.255
then you go in. But that takes about ten minutes.

02:37:10.255 --> 02:37:13.691
SAM: Okay. Yes. Sounds good to me.

02:37:13.691 --> 02:37:15.932
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. We're kind of in the middle of
a short rest anyways.

02:37:15.932 --> 02:37:22.083
LIAM: So I will pull out my spellbook and I will
use ritual casting to cast Detect Magic.

02:37:22.083 --> 02:37:36.420
MATT: Okay. As you focus, there is a-- as you look
over, there is a faint magical aura from inside

02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:44.026
the pool where the mist is emanating, and the long
wooden box emanates a magical source from the

02:37:44.026 --> 02:37:45.323
inside.

02:37:45.323 --> 02:37:46.724
TALIESIN: Is the staff that the--

02:37:46.724 --> 02:37:50.317
MATT: You'd have to try and retrieve the body. It
sunk into the water.

02:37:50.317 --> 02:37:51.804
TALIESIN: We grabbed it before it sank.

02:37:51.804 --> 02:37:56.239
MATT: The staffed one? Okay. As you pull the staff
over, the staff does not have any magical

02:37:56.239 --> 02:38:03.214
properties. It looked like it was just a focus for
whatever spellcasting it was doing. Make an

02:38:03.214 --> 02:38:05.196
investigation check as you were going back to the
body.

02:38:05.196 --> 02:38:06.666
LIAM: There's a glow in the water as well?

02:38:06.666 --> 02:38:07.980
MATT: If you want.

02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:09.717
LIAM: Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just
saying.

02:38:09.717 --> 02:38:15.413
MATT: You feel a magical presence within the pool.
Not the pool itself, but within. And the mist is

02:38:15.413 --> 02:38:17.230
still pouring over the edges of it.

02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:18.950
ASHLEY: The pool that's up at the--

02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:20.413
MATT: Yeah, the upper platform.

02:38:20.413 --> 02:38:22.397
MARISHA: I like having codenames.

02:38:22.397 --> 02:38:27.831
LAURA: Are you looking? Who's looking?

02:38:27.831 --> 02:38:30.292
SAM: I'll try-- Should I try to open the box?

02:38:30.292 --> 02:38:34.238
TRAVIS: He's still doing his magic circle or
whatever.

02:38:34.238 --> 02:38:38.692
LIAM: We know that there is something magical in
the pool itself and then you said the long wooden

02:38:38.692 --> 02:38:39.892
box is glowing?

02:38:39.892 --> 02:38:40.691
MATT: Yes.

02:38:40.691 --> 02:38:42.475
LIAM: What kind of magic is coming off of the
wooden box?

02:38:42.475 --> 02:38:43.632
MATT: Enchantment.

02:38:43.632 --> 02:38:44.540
LIAM: Enchantment.

02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:45.693
LAURA: (exaggerated cockney accent) Enchantment!

02:38:45.693 --> 02:38:48.982
MATT: (exaggerated cockney accent) Enchantment!
Hi, Yuri.

02:38:48.982 --> 02:38:51.815
TALIESIN: I'll take a look in there. I'll walk
towards the pool at the very least. I'm going to

02:38:51.815 --> 02:38:54.021
pick up any of the Moonweaver pieces.

02:38:54.021 --> 02:38:59.574
MATT: Make an investigation check as you pore
through and find as many as you want to.

02:38:59.574 --> 02:39:07.062
LIAM: I don't believe that there is any kind of
protection or magical lock on that. So, yeah, try

02:39:07.062 --> 02:39:09.163
to pick the lock from a distance.

02:39:09.163 --> 02:39:14.175
LAURA: Ooh, what are all these things, Molly?

02:39:14.175 --> 02:39:17.942
TALIESIN: I'm not entirely sure, but they're very,
very nice.

02:39:17.942 --> 02:39:20.661
MATT: Are you glancing through as well?

02:39:20.661 --> 02:39:23.200
LAURA: Yeah. I want to find something for the
Traveler.

02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:24.664
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

02:39:24.664 --> 02:39:28.615
TRAVIS: Is this on the priest? The shallow
priest?

02:39:28.615 --> 02:39:31.453
MATT: This is the pile of religious iconography.

02:39:31.453 --> 02:39:32.396
LAURA: 11.

02:39:32.396 --> 02:39:34.023
MATT: 11. Okay. Because--

02:39:34.023 --> 02:39:35.120
TALIESIN: Also 11.

02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:39.338
MATT: All right. You find-- and there's a number
of these. You see, probably, in total, well over

02:39:39.338 --> 02:39:49.728
100 to 120 various holy symbols, idols, small
representations pressed into metal or clay. These

02:39:49.728 --> 02:39:57.299
are all means of worship from a grand scale to a
pauper scale that seem to have been part of what

02:39:57.299 --> 02:40:00.416
was moving through this smuggling path.

02:40:00.416 --> 02:40:03.377
LAURA: I'm looking for the Traveler's symbol.

02:40:03.377 --> 02:40:05.449
MATT: Which you find two.

02:40:05.449 --> 02:40:06.843
(gasps)

02:40:06.843 --> 02:40:16.159
MATT: You, who have never met anybody else who has
ever met the Traveler, you look down and find

02:40:16.159 --> 02:40:23.782
amongst this pile two holy symbols of different
make. One appears to be almost pure silver. One

02:40:23.782 --> 02:40:30.290
looks like it's a little more of a burnished
bronze or a dull iron that's very, very heavily

02:40:30.290 --> 02:40:37.721
tarnished. But they both have the same door arch
with the road expanding from the center.

02:40:37.721 --> 02:40:39.829
LAURA: Whoa! Look!

02:40:39.829 --> 02:40:42.975
SAM: What is it? What are they?

02:40:42.975 --> 02:40:44.520
LAURA: Oh, I wasn't talking to you.

02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:45.653
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:40:45.653 --> 02:40:46.859
LAURA: Look!

02:40:46.859 --> 02:40:48.189
TRAVIS: Who are you talking to, Jester?

02:40:48.189 --> 02:40:51.882
LAURA: The Traveler! Lookit! You have symbols
here!

02:40:51.882 --> 02:40:53.082
TALIESIN: It looks like a door.

02:40:53.082 --> 02:40:55.235
LAURA: It is a door. He's a traveler. He travels.

02:40:55.235 --> 02:40:56.412
TALIESIN: His symbol is a door?

02:40:56.412 --> 02:40:57.498
LAURA: Yeah.

02:40:57.498 --> 02:40:59.207
TRAVIS: Do you feel the Traveler in here?

02:40:59.207 --> 02:41:05.593
LAURA: Well, if he is, he was fucking with me
earlier. Are you in here?

02:41:05.593 --> 02:41:07.579
MATT: No response.

02:41:07.579 --> 02:41:09.107
LAURA: I don't think so.

02:41:09.107 --> 02:41:15.201
MARISHA: Do I see anything from Ioun? I hobble up,
crack my rib back in place.

02:41:15.201 --> 02:41:17.468
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:41:17.468 --> 02:41:18.503
MARISHA: Okay.

02:41:18.503 --> 02:41:22.833
TRAVIS: It's actually a little discomforting,
these symbols.

02:41:22.833 --> 02:41:25.605
TALIESIN: I would say so.

02:41:25.650 --> 02:41:26.874
MARISHA: You said investigation?

02:41:26.874 --> 02:41:27.917
MATT: Yep.

02:41:27.917 --> 02:41:30.013
MARISHA: Ten.

02:41:30.013 --> 02:41:35.113
MATT: You give a solid glance through and it looks
like, no. Ioun, the Knowing Mistress, is one of

02:41:35.113 --> 02:41:40.093
the approved religions, and you get the sense that
all the symbols that are here are religions that

02:41:40.093 --> 02:41:44.809
are unapproved by the Empire or considered
betrayer gods and are not approved anywhere.

02:41:44.809 --> 02:41:46.980
TALIESIN: What do I find for the Moonweaver?

02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:51.352
MATT: Oh, plenty of Moonweaver symbols. There's
probably a good 12 or 13.

02:41:51.352 --> 02:41:56.203
TRAVIS: There's also some very dark deities here.
Asmodeus.

02:41:56.203 --> 02:41:57.499
LAURA: Which ones are the bad ones?

02:41:57.499 --> 02:41:58.801
TRAVIS: Asmodeus?

02:41:58.801 --> 02:42:00.052
MATT: Asmodeus.

02:42:00.052 --> 02:42:03.857
TRAVIS: Asmodeus, Bane the Strife Emperor,
Tiamat--

02:42:03.857 --> 02:42:07.564
LAURA and MATT: (singing) Asmodeus, Asmodeus!

02:42:07.564 --> 02:42:11.639
SAM: I'll cast Mage Hand from afar and try to
unlock the big box.

02:42:11.639 --> 02:42:16.715
MATT: Go ahead and make your-- with disadvantage.

02:42:16.715 --> 02:42:18.091
SAM: Oh, an 18 and a 19.

02:42:18.091 --> 02:42:20.797
MATT: Oh, look at that! Even while drunk, little
Nott's able to--

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:23.090
LIAM: (sing-song) Do-de-do-de-do!

02:42:23.090 --> 02:42:26.890
SAM: (sing-song)
Whoopie-doopie-doopie-doopie-doop, click!

02:42:26.890 --> 02:42:30.236
TALIESIN: You did check for traps, right?

02:42:30.236 --> 02:42:31.568
LAURA: Doesn't matter.

02:42:31.568 --> 02:42:34.428
SAM: No, I'm opening it! Fuck off, grandpa!

02:42:34.428 --> 02:42:38.555
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit back and watch.

02:42:38.555 --> 02:42:41.651
LIAM: She's doing it from 30 feet away. Hopefully
that's enough.

02:42:41.651 --> 02:42:51.889
MATT: The latch spins off, and a blade fires out
from where the lock was, shoots across the room,

02:42:51.889 --> 02:42:55.958
and vanishes into the darkness before it scrapes
off some stone in the distance.

02:42:55.958 --> 02:43:00.607
LAURA: Good job, Nott!

02:43:00.607 --> 02:43:01.915
TALIESIN: Again!

02:43:01.915 --> 02:43:07.134
MATT: It appears to be open. There's a slight gap
now where the lid is now open. You lift it up.

02:43:07.134 --> 02:43:16.871
Looking inside, you see this beautiful
jewel-inlaid, curved golden blade of some kind.

02:43:16.871 --> 02:43:22.052
With what little bit of light that you guys have at
your disposal now, you can see it shining and it's

02:43:22.052 --> 02:43:30.636
this pure gold color. As you swing it for a
moment, it seems to bend with the movement before

02:43:30.636 --> 02:43:32.298
flicking back into place.

02:43:32.298 --> 02:43:33.430
LAURA: It's made of rubber.

02:43:33.430 --> 02:43:35.840
MARISHA: It's the rubber pencil trick.

02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:42.353
SAM: Is it a super long blade? Or is it like a
rapier-type thing?

02:43:42.353 --> 02:43:45.017
MATT: It would constitute in the vein of a
scimitar.

02:43:45.017 --> 02:43:49.118
TALIESIN: That looks very exciting. I'm going to
run over--

02:43:49.118 --> 02:43:50.834
SAM: No, I don't think--

02:43:50.834 --> 02:43:54.557
TALIESIN: Yeah, nope, no-- I'm pushing aside. I'm
going to try the weight.

02:43:54.557 --> 02:44:00.878
MATT: It's pretty well-balanced. Lighter than you'd
expect. And gold is not a good metal for any sort

02:44:00.878 --> 02:44:06.833
of combat. It's a soft metal and you see the
flexibility seems such but yet it'd probably hit

02:44:06.833 --> 02:44:11.210
pretty hard, but you're a little worried about
using gold for any sort of combat scenario.

02:44:11.210 --> 02:44:13.497
LAURA: Maybe it's ceremonial.

02:44:13.497 --> 02:44:15.250
TALIESIN: Perhaps.

02:44:15.250 --> 02:44:16.588
ASHLEY: Swing it around.

02:44:16.588 --> 02:44:17.852
TALIESIN: I give it a swing.

02:44:17.852 --> 02:44:20.205
MATT: Swings pretty solid.

02:44:20.205 --> 02:44:21.520
ASHLEY: Want to hit me with it?

02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:26.996
LAURA: No, wait! Let Caleb look at it. What if
it's super-duper cursed, Yasha?

02:44:26.996 --> 02:44:30.093
SAM: We'll melt it down and sell it for raw gold.

02:44:30.093 --> 02:44:31.832
TALIESIN: It's worth more as it is.

02:44:31.832 --> 02:44:38.225
LIAM: That looks heavy, so first, you hold that.
Have we found everything? Also, while all that was

02:44:38.225 --> 02:44:42.839
going on, I was looking for a jagged cross with
two crescent moons in it.

02:44:42.839 --> 02:44:48.856
MATT: Yes, and you managed to find it. You find
probably about 6 or 7 different variations to the

02:44:48.856 --> 02:44:50.309
Archeart's iconography.

02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:51.670
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Archeart?

02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:57.145
LIAM: Of those 6 or 7 that I saw, I will take the
one that looks the most familiar to me from my

02:44:57.145 --> 02:44:58.285
memory.

02:44:58.285 --> 02:45:00.092
MATT: You find one that's pretty similar to the
one that you saw.

02:45:00.092 --> 02:45:01.427
LIAM: I'm going to keep that.

02:45:01.427 --> 02:45:02.587
MATT: You pocket it.

02:45:02.587 --> 02:45:03.919
ASHLEY: I rolled a 13.

02:45:03.919 --> 02:45:05.041
MATT: A 13 to--

02:45:05.041 --> 02:45:07.923
ASHLEY: To look for a symbol of the Stormlord.

02:45:07.923 --> 02:45:19.731
MATT: You find about four of them. Two of them are
medallions and one of them looks like a ceramic

02:45:19.731 --> 02:45:28.934
marker that would be hung on a wall. One of them
looks like it was part of a latch on a small chest

02:45:28.934 --> 02:45:32.245
and was torn from it. You see bits of rotted wood
on the back of it where it may have been

02:45:32.245 --> 02:45:38.883
previously pressed in and bolted against the outside
of a chest.

02:45:38.883 --> 02:45:45.760
MARISHA: Can I look around on the walls and on the
doors and, using my criminal background, see if I

02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:50.673
see anything that's Thieves' Cant or smuggling
operation things?

02:45:50.673 --> 02:45:53.133
MATT: Sure. Make an investigation check.

02:45:53.133 --> 02:45:56.725
MARISHA: 23.

02:45:56.725 --> 02:46:00.811
MATT: Okay. While you guys are having this
conversation, Beau is casing the joint here. There

02:46:00.811 --> 02:46:05.311
are no hidden exits. In fact, you get the sense
that all the entrances and exits here are through

02:46:05.311 --> 02:46:10.200
the various pools of water. You begin to think,
based on placement, that there's probably a

02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:14.993
network of caverns here, and possibly more merrow
that exist in the vicinity of the lake, of the

02:46:14.993 --> 02:46:17.004
Ounterloch beyond here.

02:46:17.004 --> 02:46:21.795
TRAVIS: Can you describe what the Bane, the Strife
Emperor, symbol looks like?

02:46:21.795 --> 02:46:25.183
MATT: Yes, actually. I can show you an image of
it.

02:46:25.183 --> 02:46:28.897
LAURA: You know, there are a lot of shackles
around everywhere, right?

02:46:28.897 --> 02:46:30.384
TRAVIS: Here?

02:46:30.384 --> 02:46:31.499
TALIESIN: In general.

02:46:31.499 --> 02:46:38.363
LAURA: Didn't we find, like, four manacles? And
there were four dead bodies, too, right in the

02:46:38.363 --> 02:46:39.929
other room?

02:46:39.929 --> 02:46:42.290
MARISHA: We keep finding dead skeletons.

02:46:42.290 --> 02:46:46.242
ASHLEY: And also steal 185 gold, which we did not
disburse.

02:46:46.242 --> 02:46:53.044
MATT: That is what you see. It's like an
upside-down, coffin-like design, with these chains

02:46:53.096 --> 02:46:54.485
that cross over.

02:46:54.485 --> 02:46:56.108
TRAVIS: It's just this little handheld thing?

02:46:56.108 --> 02:46:58.938
MATT: Yes. It's roughly a little larger than your
palm.

02:46:58.938 --> 02:47:00.996
TRAVIS: Can I toss it into the well?

02:47:00.996 --> 02:47:12.209
MATT: Sure. It sinks down and for a moment, it
obscures, but you see this very faint yellowish

02:47:12.249 --> 02:47:14.511
color on the bottom. It disappears into the pool.

02:47:14.511 --> 02:47:21.713
LAURA: Why would you do that? Are you trying to
bring about this really weird god? Can I reach

02:47:21.758 --> 02:47:23.235
in and try to get it out?

02:47:23.235 --> 02:47:31.112
MATT: Sure. You reach in and you scour around and
your hand touches and finds the symbol. Next to

02:47:31.112 --> 02:47:37.313
it, there's a polished stone about that big that's
resting in the silt at the bottom.

02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:39.373
LAURA: Ooh. I reach in and grab that.

02:47:39.373 --> 02:47:45.566
MATT: Okay. You pull out the stone, and as soon as
the water emerges from it, it's smooth. It looks

02:47:45.566 --> 02:47:52.290
like a cat's eye. It has a yellowish color to it
and there are striations that refract light around

02:47:52.290 --> 02:48:01.455
it. At one end, it looks like there was-- an impact
carved a line about three inches across on one side.

02:48:01.455 --> 02:48:03.517
LIAM: Clearly that's what's glowing at the bottom
to my eyes?

02:48:03.517 --> 02:48:05.338
MATT: It has a very faint yellowish glow.

02:48:05.338 --> 02:48:07.533
LIAM: What kind of magic, school of magic, is it?

02:48:07.533 --> 02:48:13.235
MATT: It's not a school of arcane magic.

02:48:13.235 --> 02:48:18.187
LAURA: What is this? I still grab the other little
symbol.

02:48:18.187 --> 02:48:19.430
MATT: Okay, symbol there.

02:48:19.430 --> 02:48:21.926
LIAM: I don't know. I think you should put it--

02:48:21.926 --> 02:48:23.010
LAURA: Want to look at it?

02:48:23.010 --> 02:48:26.189
LIAM: Yeah, let's put it down with that sword that
we found, Mollymauk.

02:48:26.189 --> 02:48:29.997
MARISHA: Does the groove in it look like it
matches the size of the blade of the sword?

02:48:29.997 --> 02:48:36.418
MATT: She sets it down, and rests it there next to
the other symbol, at an angle. It doesn't look

02:48:36.418 --> 02:48:42.863
like it matches the sword. The groove that's hewn
into it, what at first looked like it was impacted or

02:48:42.863 --> 02:48:48.658
wounded by some sort of damage, upon closer look,
it looks intentionally placed or carved in. So you

02:48:48.658 --> 02:48:57.077
have this cat's eye, yellowish sphere with this
three inch-wide, pointed oval line in the front.

02:48:57.077 --> 02:48:58.770
LAURA: Looks like it's an eyeball.

02:48:58.770 --> 02:48:59.810
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:48:59.810 --> 02:49:02.312
SAM: Could be the end of a sending stone or
something.

02:49:02.312 --> 02:49:05.585
TRAVIS: Did any of the shortswords, longswords,
battleaxes-- any of those register under Caleb's

02:49:05.585 --> 02:49:08.508
magic sweep or they're just nicely made?

02:49:08.508 --> 02:49:11.035
MATT: They're just well-made, like freshly made
and were being sent somewhere.

02:49:11.035 --> 02:49:12.304
SAM: Should we take them all?

02:49:12.304 --> 02:49:13.612
LIAM: Do you want to see something?

02:49:13.612 --> 02:49:15.097
LAURA: I hold it up in front of my face.

02:49:15.097 --> 02:49:16.639
SAM: Ah, you're a cyclops! Kill her!

02:49:16.639 --> 02:49:17.910
LAURA: Can I see through it?

02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:19.197
MATT: You cannot.

02:49:19.197 --> 02:49:20.217
LIAM: Come with me, okay?

02:49:20.217 --> 02:49:21.194
LAURA: All right.

02:49:21.194 --> 02:49:26.460
LIAM: I'm going to lead Jester up to the top where
fish guy was at the beginning with his staff. Set

02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:28.784
it down, and--

02:49:28.784 --> 02:49:30.183
MATT: That's where you guys are standing right
now.

02:49:30.183 --> 02:49:31.106
LIAM: We're already up there?

02:49:31.106 --> 02:49:32.782
MATT: That's where you've removed from the pool.

02:49:32.782 --> 02:49:34.944
LIAM: Yeah, I want to go up where all the little
thingies are.

02:49:34.944 --> 02:49:35.945
MATT: Yes.

02:49:35.945 --> 02:49:42.623
LIAM: Let's set it down, just in case. Okay? Then
I pull out my spell book again and-- Will you hold

02:49:42.623 --> 02:49:43.776
this for me?

02:49:43.776 --> 02:49:45.855
LAURA: Of course I will. Thank you very much.

02:49:45.855 --> 02:49:52.229
LIAM: Sit down with me. I rifle through the pages
to the right one for Identify and the sword is

02:49:52.229 --> 02:49:58.411
down. Okay, I'm going to use this one. You can
see-- and I start showing the different glyphs and

02:49:58.411 --> 02:49:59.768
I start the ritual.

02:49:59.768 --> 02:50:03.435
MATT: Fjord. Something about that orb is very familiar.

02:50:03.435 --> 02:50:04.827
SAM: He's teaching you magic. Listen carefully.

02:50:04.827 --> 02:50:05.893
LAURA: I am.

02:50:05.893 --> 02:50:07.682
SAM: You'll learn new spells this way.

02:50:07.682 --> 02:50:08.991
LAURA: I'm listening.

02:50:08.991 --> 02:50:11.487
SAM: What did he just say?

02:50:11.487 --> 02:50:12.814
LAURA: He's not talking right now.

02:50:12.814 --> 02:50:13.936
SAM: Oh, yes. Okay.

02:50:13.936 --> 02:50:15.661
LAURA: He's muttering.

02:50:15.661 --> 02:50:17.455
LIAM: So it takes ten minutes to make the spell.

02:50:17.455 --> 02:50:18.584
MATT: Okay. So, while you're doing that.

02:50:18.584 --> 02:50:20.760
TALIESIN: Is there one more box we haven't
opened?

02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:23.126
MATT: There is one more metal box that's not been
opened.

02:50:23.126 --> 02:50:24.764
SAM: Should I open it?

02:50:24.764 --> 02:50:25.987
TALIESIN: You should check for traps and open it.

02:50:25.987 --> 02:50:29.584
SAM: All right. I'll finger it from afar.

02:50:29.631 --> 02:50:31.026
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:50:31.026 --> 02:50:33.666
LAURA: Are we far enough away from it?

02:50:33.666 --> 02:50:35.309
MATT: With disadvantage, because you are drunk.

02:50:35.309 --> 02:50:36.478
SAM: It's a one.

02:50:36.478 --> 02:50:37.542
MATT: Okay. Seems fine.

02:50:37.542 --> 02:50:39.498
SAM: I'll open it.

02:50:39.498 --> 02:50:41.957
TALIESIN: In theory, we've moved it aside.

02:50:41.957 --> 02:50:44.415
MATT: All right. Disadvantage, to try and open the
lock.

02:50:44.415 --> 02:50:47.872
SAM: What is this, thieves' tools?

02:50:47.872 --> 02:50:50.345
MATT: Thieves' tools. So it's dexterity plus your
proficiency bonus.

02:50:50.345 --> 02:50:56.225
SAM: I'll never figure this out. Dexterity plus--

02:50:56.225 --> 02:50:57.516
LAURA: Proficiency.

02:50:57.516 --> 02:50:58.815
SAM: I rolled a ten.

02:50:58.815 --> 02:50:59.919
LAURA: So 17.

02:50:59.919 --> 02:51:10.252
MATT: 17? That'll do it. You needed a 16. The iron
box opens. Nothing goes off; no blades, no traps.

02:51:10.252 --> 02:51:15.768
On the inside, you see a beautifully smithed sword
handle and hilt made from silver with an

02:51:15.768 --> 02:51:19.211
acorn-sized emerald set on each side of the hilt,
right in the center.

02:51:19.211 --> 02:51:20.659
TALIESIN: Oh, let's put that in the pile.

02:51:20.659 --> 02:51:21.767
SAM: There's no blade?

02:51:21.767 --> 02:51:25.518
MATT: The blade extends for an inch before it's
broken off at a jagged angle.

02:51:25.518 --> 02:51:27.337
TALIESIN: Let's put that in the pile, too.

02:51:27.337 --> 02:51:28.430
MARISHA: An inch?

02:51:28.430 --> 02:51:30.788
MATT: There's an inch of the blade. It seems to
have broken off at some point.

02:51:30.788 --> 02:51:32.034
LAURA: Is it magic?

02:51:32.034 --> 02:51:34.507
LIAM: I thought it was just the long box that we
already opened.

02:51:34.507 --> 02:51:35.828
SAM: Well, this was a metal box.

02:51:35.828 --> 02:51:37.324
MATT: Right. You did not sense any magic from
this.

02:51:37.324 --> 02:51:39.256
LAURA: (gasps) Can I use Mending on it?

02:51:39.256 --> 02:51:41.261
LIAM: If the box was solid enough, that's true.

02:51:41.261 --> 02:51:43.317
MATT: You attempt to cast Mending on this?

02:51:43.317 --> 02:51:44.578
LAURA: On the sword.

02:51:44.578 --> 02:51:46.415
MATT: Strangely, it resists it.

02:51:46.415 --> 02:51:47.753
TRAVIS: Oh, put that shit in the pile.

02:51:47.753 --> 02:51:49.185
LAURA: Yeah. Okay.

02:51:49.185 --> 02:51:53.493
MATT: There's something about it. Even though it
didn't emanate a magical essence from what he was

02:51:53.493 --> 02:51:58.591
requesting, the Mending spell, for some reason, is
unable to grasp the nature of this object to

02:51:58.591 --> 02:51:59.888
complete it.

02:51:59.888 --> 02:52:03.470
LIAM: I would think there would be enough time
overlap, though, for Detect Magic to still have

02:52:03.470 --> 02:52:08.487
one or two minutes left before we get to the end
of Identify. So if that is brought over, do I

02:52:08.487 --> 02:52:11.016
notice any sort of glow from--

02:52:11.016 --> 02:52:16.321
MATT: No magical essence from it, but as you're
looking over it, beyond just the beautiful make of

02:52:16.321 --> 02:52:25.897
it, you do see runes carved across the hilt and at
the pommel. It looks like at one point it was an

02:52:25.947 --> 02:52:28.987
enchanted blade, but was sundered and is missing
the rest.

02:52:28.987 --> 02:52:34.528
LIAM: Okay. So I mutter. I pause my chanting and
say: I will take a look at that in a moment. Hold

02:52:34.528 --> 02:52:37.933
on. And finish my 11 minutes of ritual casting.

02:52:37.933 --> 02:52:42.370
TRAVIS: I'm not going to interrupt, but that
sphere looks very--

02:52:42.370 --> 02:52:44.189
LAURA: Like an eyeball.

02:52:44.189 --> 02:52:46.559
TRAVIS: Yeah, famili-- Do you mind if I-- is it
wet?

02:52:46.559 --> 02:52:54.042
LIAM: Wait. Is anyone going to interrupt me before
I get to the end of Identify?

02:52:54.042 --> 02:52:55.845
SAM: No. Let's wait in real time. 11 minutes.

02:52:55.845 --> 02:52:56.797
LIAM: Yeah?

02:52:56.797 --> 02:52:58.535
(laughter)

02:52:58.535 --> 02:53:00.628
TALIESIN: Roll initiative.

02:53:00.628 --> 02:53:11.258
MARISHA: It doesn't look like the gash in the orb
is deeper than the length of the blade that's left,

02:53:11.258 --> 02:53:12.928
correct?

02:53:12.928 --> 02:53:14.432
MATT: I'm sorry. What was that?

02:53:14.432 --> 02:53:17.850
LIAM: Just a bunch of sexual innuendo, Matt.

02:53:17.898 --> 02:53:19.672
ASHLEY: But what about the other sword?

02:53:19.672 --> 02:53:20.977
MATT: What was your question?

02:53:20.977 --> 02:53:22.609
MARISHA: The-- god damn it.

02:53:22.609 --> 02:53:26.054
SAM: No. He said before that it didn't look like
the blade made the gash in the eye.

02:53:26.054 --> 02:53:27.864
MARISHA: But this was a different blade.

02:53:27.864 --> 02:53:29.146
ASHLEY: That was a different blade, though.

02:53:29.146 --> 02:53:30.072
MARISHA: There are two blades.

02:53:30.072 --> 02:53:32.538
LIAM: Yes. There's a complete blade that's magic.

02:53:32.538 --> 02:53:35.573
MARISHA: But I'm just wondering if it fits. Never
mind.

02:53:35.573 --> 02:53:36.655
MATT: Oh, fits the--

02:53:36.655 --> 02:53:38.607
MARISHA: Let him finish the damn spell.

02:53:38.607 --> 02:53:41.501
TRAVIS: If it fits the gash in the side of the
sphere.

02:53:41.501 --> 02:53:42.831
MARISHA: The sphere. The broken hilt.

02:53:42.831 --> 02:53:48.448
MATT: No. The carve in the sphere is about three
inches long. The blade looks like it would've been

02:53:48.448 --> 02:53:52.285
about two inches wide and it's broken off at a
jagged side angle.

02:53:52.285 --> 02:53:57.796
LIAM: Caleb is furrowing his brow at everybody
arguing about this as he's 30 seconds away from

02:53:57.796 --> 02:53:58.750
ending.

02:53:58.750 --> 02:54:00.962
MARISHA: Stop! Con-cen-trate! Con-cen-trate!

02:54:00.962 --> 02:54:02.990
LIAM: Lost. Gone.

02:54:02.990 --> 02:54:09.863
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll help Jester look around. Maybe
we see a broken blade somewhere while he finishes that.

02:54:09.863 --> 02:54:11.458
LIAM: Jester's holding my spell book.

02:54:11.458 --> 02:54:15.299
LAURA: I know. I pass it over to Nott. Here. I'm
not learning anything.

02:54:15.299 --> 02:54:18.871
MARISHA: Jester and I do a quick scan to see if we
can find the broken blade.

02:54:18.871 --> 02:54:23.769
MATT: Okay. Investigation check. Either both of
you roll, or one of you roll with advantage. Up to you.

02:54:23.769 --> 02:54:26.692
LAURA: Take advantage.

02:54:26.692 --> 02:54:36.940
MARISHA: Do you see anything? Take advantage? A
nine and a ten? It's okay. 15.

02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:42.161
MATT: 15. Looking around, you see no sign of any
other half of the blade, broken or not.

02:54:42.161 --> 02:54:48.391
TALIESIN: It was in a case, so I suppose it would
be unlikely. Or if it was on its way somewhere,

02:54:48.391 --> 02:54:50.055
it was probably on the way to the other end of it.

02:54:50.055 --> 02:54:52.414
LAURA: I walk back over to Caleb.

02:54:52.414 --> 02:54:55.665
MATT: Okay. Anybody else? Okay.

02:54:55.665 --> 02:54:58.321
MARISHA: What do you find out?

02:54:58.321 --> 02:54:59.901
MATT: So you finish casting Identify on--

02:54:59.901 --> 02:55:04.044
LIAM: On sword and cat's eye. It's whatever's
sitting in my little--

02:55:04.044 --> 02:55:08.129
MATT: All right. The sword is not magical, and so
it does not give you any essence as to what

02:55:08.129 --> 02:55:12.492
enchantment it is. Looking at the runes, you could
see that there was once held magic--

02:55:12.492 --> 02:55:13.901
LIAM: The complete sword?

02:55:13.901 --> 02:55:17.317
MATT: Oh, the finished one? Sorry, I
misunderstood. That, yes.

02:55:17.317 --> 02:55:20.133
LIAM: All this shit doesn't exist, so sometimes
it's hard to tell what we're talking about.

02:55:20.133 --> 02:55:21.179
MATT: I'm sorry.

02:55:21.179 --> 02:55:22.417
LAURA: It exists, Liam.

02:55:22.417 --> 02:55:24.861
MATT: That, you do have immediate grasp of what it
is capable of.

02:55:24.861 --> 02:55:27.591
LIAM: This blade is called Summer's Dance.

02:55:27.591 --> 02:55:32.443
MARISHA: (singing) Ooh, I want to dance with
somebody.

02:55:32.443 --> 02:55:36.498
MARISHA, SAM, and LAURA: (singing) I want to feel
the heat with somebody!

02:55:36.498 --> 02:55:41.611
LIAM: Mr. Mollymauk?

02:55:41.611 --> 02:55:43.671
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb.

02:55:43.671 --> 02:55:50.504
LIAM: I feel like this might be good for you.
There is a kind of magic that I do not even

02:55:50.504 --> 02:55:59.411
possess that allows you to vanish from one point
and reappear in another, and this blade will allow

02:55:59.411 --> 02:56:00.623
you to do it.

02:56:00.623 --> 02:56:06.917
TALIESIN: (maniacal laughter) You're going to get
yours, oh yes.

02:56:06.917 --> 02:56:14.828
LIAM: It is a very fine blade. It is more lethal
than a regular blade and will allow you to poof,

02:56:14.828 --> 02:56:16.352
poof, poof.

02:56:16.352 --> 02:56:18.858
TALIESIN: I'll be living the dream.

02:56:18.858 --> 02:56:25.923
LIAM: You can all argue over it, but I hand it to
Mollymauk. As well as the cat's eye.

02:56:25.923 --> 02:56:29.153
MATT: Okay, so you begin concentrating another ten
minutes on the cat's eye.

02:56:29.153 --> 02:56:31.266
LIAM: Is it one spell, one item?

02:56:31.266 --> 02:56:32.672
MATT: You choose one object to cast on.

02:56:32.672 --> 02:56:33.789
LIAM: Okay, next.

02:56:33.789 --> 02:56:35.011
MATT: So wait another ten minutes.

02:56:35.011 --> 02:56:40.910
TRAVIS: While he's concentrating on it, can I sit
down next to him and touch it?

02:56:40.910 --> 02:56:42.217
MATT: Sure.

02:56:42.217 --> 02:56:44.635
SAM: Touch it, meaning his penis.

02:56:44.635 --> 02:56:45.639
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:56:45.639 --> 02:56:47.324
LIAM: You're welcome, internet.

02:56:47.324 --> 02:56:57.403
MATT: As Caleb's concentrating on it, you reach
out and touch the stone. Your body immediately

02:56:57.403 --> 02:56:58.413
goes cold.

02:56:58.413 --> 02:57:00.073
SAM: Oh! He's dead, he died.

02:57:00.073 --> 02:57:01.740
LIAM: Could have waited 11 minutes, but no.

02:57:01.740 --> 02:57:10.360
MATT: Your vision vanishes from your eyes as
darkness fills your world. Your lids itch like

02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:16.634
some sand or dirt now scrapes the inside of the
skin, and you rub them with your wrist. Your eyes

02:57:16.634 --> 02:57:24.367
open to find yourself somewhere else. The sky is
moonlit and cloudless, the starry night looking

02:57:24.367 --> 02:57:32.740
down at you. Your clothes are not your own, nor is
your body. A thick, brown leather overcoat lined

02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:39.293
in buckles wraps around your torso while
sun-weathered human skin marks your flesh. You

02:57:39.293 --> 02:57:43.865
notice your hands are dirty and thick with
calluses as you clutch the very same yellow,

02:57:43.865 --> 02:57:50.542
polished stone in your left hand. Looking down,
you see the body of the individual who was its

02:57:50.542 --> 02:57:57.389
previous owner, now still in a pool of crimson
dark. You glance around the place, some

02:57:57.389 --> 02:58:03.174
jungle-grown natural landmass by a pond. The smell
of seawater is strong on the wind in the middle of

02:58:03.174 --> 02:58:10.912
the night. Flash-- in your right hand grasps the
familiar falchion, water dripping from the blade.

02:58:10.912 --> 02:58:23.235
A voice booms into your mind: "Potential." A
sudden, uncontrollable hunger overcomes you as you

02:58:23.235 --> 02:58:30.331
instinctually jam the stone into your gut. It
slowly sinks into your human flesh painlessly. As

02:58:30.331 --> 02:58:38.640
it's being pushed into your torso: "Consume." As
it quickly vanishes within your belly, the hunger

02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:45.042
subsides as exhaustion takes over. You fall to
your knees and look within the water, your

02:58:45.042 --> 02:58:58.809
reflection familiar, but not your own: Vandrin.
"Reward." Just as quickly as the vision came, in

02:58:58.809 --> 02:59:04.053
the blink of an eye, it's gone, your reflection
now that of the familiar half-orc, looking into

02:59:04.053 --> 02:59:10.514
the pool where the stone was found, but the stone
is gone. The rest of you guys watched, in the

02:59:10.514 --> 02:59:17.690
middle of this concentration, while Fjord touched
the stone, grabbed it, and jammed it into his

02:59:17.690 --> 02:59:23.537
chest. Before all of you could even react and push
forward, it had already been thrust through his

02:59:23.537 --> 02:59:27.295
armor and into his body. You reach over and try
and grab him, and with a strength you've never

02:59:27.295 --> 02:59:32.470
felt in his body, he lurches towards the pond and
thrusts it fully in, seemingly under some sort of

02:59:32.470 --> 02:59:39.967
uncontrolled force, his eyes glazed over and
staring forward. Suddenly, he comes back, and as

02:59:39.967 --> 02:59:42.826
you glance around, you feel tension on your body
as all your friends are grabbing onto your body

02:59:42.826 --> 02:59:44.847
and pull you away from the pool.

02:59:44.847 --> 02:59:47.175
MARISHA: Where's the orb?

02:59:47.175 --> 02:59:48.799
MATT: It's gone.

02:59:48.799 --> 02:59:51.678
SAM: What the fuck was that?! What just
happened?!

02:59:51.678 --> 02:59:54.443
TRAVIS: How do I feel?

02:59:54.443 --> 02:59:57.191
MATT: Exhausted.

02:59:57.191 --> 02:59:58.921
MARISHA: Are you clammy, a little warm?

02:59:58.921 --> 03:00:00.745
MATT: You actually take a point of exhaustion.

03:00:00.745 --> 03:00:05.068
LAURA: Can I touch his chest and his stomach?

03:00:05.068 --> 03:00:08.448
TALIESIN: Yeah, check to see if there's a scar or
anything.

03:00:08.448 --> 03:00:13.396
MATT: There's no damage to the armor, and as you
pull back some of the leather plates, there's no

03:00:13.396 --> 03:00:15.098
sign of a wound.

03:00:15.098 --> 03:00:19.334
TRAVIS: I feel funny. What happened?

03:00:19.334 --> 03:00:22.312
LAURA: Caleb, did you Identify it before it went
into him? What was it?

03:00:22.312 --> 03:00:23.760
TRAVIS: Into me?

03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:25.254
LAURA: You have the thing in you!

03:00:25.254 --> 03:00:27.341
ASHLEY: It's now in your chest.

03:00:27.341 --> 03:00:31.872
LIAM: You grabbed the stone before I had a chance
to finish what I was doing. Why did you do that?

03:00:31.872 --> 03:00:40.406
TRAVIS: I felt like I'd seen it before. I just
wanted to touch it.

03:00:40.406 --> 03:00:42.877
LIAM: Why?

03:00:42.877 --> 03:00:50.077
TRAVIS: I don't know. You ever see something you
felt like you'd seen in a dream before, but you

03:00:50.077 --> 03:00:52.434
don't know why or how?

03:00:52.434 --> 03:00:53.247
LIAM: No.

03:00:53.247 --> 03:00:54.665
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yes.

03:00:54.665 --> 03:01:04.083
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. I felt compelled to-- I felt
like there was half a chance I'd touch it and it

03:01:04.083 --> 03:01:09.345
wouldn't be there. I saw things.

03:01:09.345 --> 03:01:11.131
MARISHA: Like what?

03:01:11.131 --> 03:01:30.370
TRAVIS: People I knew. A man, he's very dear to
me. I don't understand it, but he was-- I was him,

03:01:30.370 --> 03:01:35.092
and he was holding the sphere. The eye.

03:01:35.092 --> 03:01:38.779
LIAM: I was him, what does that mean?

03:01:38.779 --> 03:01:40.776
ASHLEY: Who was he?

03:01:40.776 --> 03:01:48.480
TRAVIS: Again, you ever have that dream where you
look in the water and you see another face looking

03:01:48.480 --> 03:01:50.248
back at you, like you're someone else?

03:01:50.248 --> 03:01:51.430
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

03:01:51.430 --> 03:01:52.812
LAURA and LIAM: No.

03:01:52.812 --> 03:02:00.391
TRAVIS: 50/50. You said I put the sphere in my--

03:02:00.391 --> 03:02:02.576
LAURA: Yeah, you stuck it into your chest.

03:02:02.576 --> 03:02:11.152
TRAVIS: I saw him do-- I saw me as him doing the
same thing. He was standing over someone, covered

03:02:11.152 --> 03:02:14.084
in blood, and he put the sphere inside of him.

03:02:14.084 --> 03:02:15.298
LAURA: Who was he?

03:02:15.298 --> 03:02:25.015
TRAVIS: He was my mentor, a captain of mine. A man
named Vandrin.

03:02:25.015 --> 03:02:28.281
LAURA: I've heard you say his name before.

03:02:28.281 --> 03:02:40.799
TRAVIS: Yes. I haven't seen him in quite some
time. I don't know what any of this means, but I'm

03:02:40.799 --> 03:02:48.994
not a fan of losing track of time like that.

03:02:48.994 --> 03:02:53.513
LAURA: Well, what if you're cursed now? How do we
know you're going to be okay? You have a weird

03:02:53.513 --> 03:02:55.053
thing inside of you!

03:02:55.053 --> 03:03:03.184
MARISHA: Yeah, do you feel any heartburn or any
constipation? Because that thing was big, and it's--

03:03:03.184 --> 03:03:07.643
TRAVIS: I bend over and put my hands on my knees,
and--

03:03:07.643 --> 03:03:12.172
MATT: You don't feel any strange spheres in the
inside of your abdomen.

03:03:12.172 --> 03:03:15.366
TRAVIS: I don't feel anything. I do feel pretty
tired, though.

03:03:15.366 --> 03:03:17.267
ASHLEY: What happened to Vandrin?

03:03:17.267 --> 03:03:31.811
TRAVIS: I'm not exactly sure. He may be dead. He
captained a ship that I worked on for many years

03:03:31.811 --> 03:03:35.414
and there was an incident.

03:03:35.414 --> 03:03:39.242
SAM: Did the ship sink?

03:03:39.242 --> 03:03:48.575
TRAVIS: I believe so. There was an explosion, and
we were in terrible weather. There were waves, we

03:03:48.575 --> 03:03:57.033
were being thrown about, and I was knocked
overboard. I never saw what happened to Vandrin,

03:03:57.033 --> 03:04:05.182
but when I woke up, I was back on shore and I
didn't see anything of the ship or him or any of

03:04:05.182 --> 03:04:06.614
the other crewmates.

03:04:06.614 --> 03:04:11.823
LAURA: Maybe he's alive and you were seeing
through his eyes right now?

03:04:11.823 --> 03:04:19.265
TRAVIS: I would like that. I would like that very
much; he was very good to me when a lot of people

03:04:19.265 --> 03:04:26.565
in my life haven't been, but he was holding the
sphere-- how could he be holding it if I was?

03:04:26.565 --> 03:04:29.810
LAURA: Maybe there's more than one?

03:04:29.810 --> 03:04:36.059
MARISHA: Maybe if you concentrate on his idea,
maybe you can feel him some way. Or maybe this

03:04:36.059 --> 03:04:37.925
thing is like a beacon to him?

03:04:37.925 --> 03:04:42.468
SAM: Or maybe he's cursed and he's going to turn
evil and kill us all in our sleep?

03:04:42.468 --> 03:04:43.964
MARISHA: Maybe you're cursed.

03:04:43.964 --> 03:04:45.907
LIAM: Are you skipping any details?

03:04:45.907 --> 03:04:47.769
ASHLEY: Yeah, how did you survive?

03:04:47.769 --> 03:04:49.511
[battle music]

03:04:49.511 --> 03:04:53.915
LAURA: (gasps) I feel like something's going to
attack us.

03:04:53.915 --> 03:04:55.733
TALIESIN: Roll for initiative.

03:04:55.802 --> 03:04:58.839
TRAVIS: (demonic voice) I'll tell you how I
survived!

03:04:58.839 --> 03:05:03.074
MATT: Don't spoil the surprise, Travis!

03:05:03.074 --> 03:05:05.909
MARISHA: It's a trauma film, no!

03:05:05.909 --> 03:05:08.398
LIAM: Are you skipping any details?

03:05:08.398 --> 03:05:13.411
TRAVIS: Did I recognize the body that was lying in
blood?

03:05:13.411 --> 03:05:21.223
MATT: No. Nobody you'd seen before. All you recall
is seeing the orb and the same sword that you have

03:05:21.223 --> 03:05:22.629
in his hand.

03:05:22.629 --> 03:05:30.197
TRAVIS: No, no details. I knew this man very well.
He was almost like a father to me, and I never saw

03:05:30.197 --> 03:05:36.529
him holding anything like this. Not that I
remember. Do I ever remember seeing anything like

03:05:36.529 --> 03:05:39.806
that in his quarters, in his offices, anything?

03:05:39.806 --> 03:05:42.119
MATT: No, weirdly.

03:05:42.119 --> 03:05:46.962
TRAVIS: It's unique, I'd remember.

03:05:46.962 --> 03:05:51.040
MATT: There's a strange aspect as you focus really
hard to remember, but the face that you saw in the

03:05:51.040 --> 03:06:02.355
water was definitely Vandrin. Maybe a little
younger than you remember him: faintly less gray

03:06:02.355 --> 03:06:04.937
to his hair and facial hair.

03:06:04.937 --> 03:06:07.596
TRAVIS: I'm not leaving anything out.

03:06:07.596 --> 03:06:11.449
ASHLEY: But how did you survive that?

03:06:11.449 --> 03:06:20.628
TRAVIS: I'm not entirely sure. I remember getting
thrown overboard, the waves overtaking me. It was

03:06:20.628 --> 03:06:26.160
a hell of a fight, and I'm a real good swimmer,
but you'd come up for air one second and your

03:06:26.160 --> 03:06:33.301
mouth would be full of salt water the next. I
remember losing track of which way was up. It's

03:06:33.301 --> 03:06:37.918
funny, when you're underwater and it's dark, the
only way to tell which way is towards the surface

03:06:37.918 --> 03:06:43.673
is by blowing bubbles. I did that as hard as I
could with all the air that was in my lungs and

03:06:43.673 --> 03:06:58.072
those bubbles disappeared. I remember it stinging,
filling my chest and the next thing I knew, I was

03:06:58.072 --> 03:06:59.985
face-down on the shore.

03:06:59.985 --> 03:07:02.029
MARISHA: Sounds a lot like dying.

03:07:02.029 --> 03:07:11.800
TRAVIS: Yeah. I've heard a lot of tales of men
drowning, being brought back. They say that same

03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:15.647
thing. But no one was with me on that shore, I was
alone.

03:07:15.647 --> 03:07:17.690
LAURA: Maybe mermaids rescued you.

03:07:17.690 --> 03:07:24.078
SAM: Or maybe your father is a sperm whale and
that's how you survived, because you're half whale

03:07:24.078 --> 03:07:25.534
or fish.

03:07:25.534 --> 03:07:27.972
LAURA: Maybe you're a mermaid and you don't know.

03:07:27.972 --> 03:07:29.809
SAM: I think that that's likely.

03:07:29.809 --> 03:07:31.340
ASHLEY: What kind of ship was it?

03:07:31.340 --> 03:07:36.522
TRAVIS: Just a merchant ship. He had many.

03:07:36.522 --> 03:07:39.286
LAURA: What was the explosion you talked about?

03:07:39.286 --> 03:07:47.590
TRAVIS: There was a bit of sabotage on the ship.

03:07:47.590 --> 03:07:49.882
MARISHA: A coup?

03:07:49.882 --> 03:07:58.583
TRAVIS: I wish I knew. If I'm lucky, one of these
days I'll find out.

03:07:58.583 --> 03:08:03.018
MARISHA: Well, might be sooner rather than later,
now.

03:08:03.018 --> 03:08:07.337
LAURA: Oh man, that's totally weird.

03:08:07.337 --> 03:08:12.651
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up and take a look at
this pool one more time. I want to taste the

03:08:12.651 --> 03:08:14.052
water; is it fresh or salt?

03:08:14.052 --> 03:08:15.756
MATT: The water is salt water.

03:08:15.756 --> 03:08:19.322
TRAVIS: The pool water?

03:08:19.322 --> 03:08:22.659
MATT: The pool water is salt water. All the rest
of the water in this cavern is fresh.

03:08:22.659 --> 03:08:24.401
MARISHA: The pool water is salt water?

03:08:24.401 --> 03:08:25.363
MATT: Yes.

03:08:25.363 --> 03:08:27.901
TALIESIN: It's sea water.

03:08:27.901 --> 03:08:32.413
ASHLEY: Fjord, what if you try jumping in this
water?

03:08:32.413 --> 03:08:34.259
MARISHA: I kind of agree with that.

03:08:34.259 --> 03:08:39.464
TALIESIN: Why were they bringing religious
iconography to this thing? What were they trying

03:08:39.464 --> 03:08:40.901
to do with it?

03:08:40.901 --> 03:08:46.830
MARISHA: Well, this is all, from what I can
recognize, deities that are not sanctioned by the

03:08:46.830 --> 03:08:47.893
empire.

03:08:47.893 --> 03:08:50.055
TRAVIS: But good and evil deities.

03:08:50.055 --> 03:08:56.107
MARISHA: I mean, things that are wanted that are
illegal are going to be wanted. It seems like

03:08:56.107 --> 03:09:01.086
there was clearly a high demand for some people to
worship who they want to.

03:09:01.086 --> 03:09:04.155
TRAVIS: On the edge or around it, right? Not in?

03:09:04.155 --> 03:09:06.289
MATT: Yeah, and you get-- make an intelligence
check for me.

03:09:06.289 --> 03:09:09.358
LIAM: I feel like we're missing something.

03:09:09.358 --> 03:09:11.158
TRAVIS: 16.

03:09:11.158 --> 03:09:15.568
MATT: Looking at this, and looking at the way
things are spread about, you get the sense that

03:09:15.568 --> 03:09:25.808
something drew the merrow to the safe house. They
took whatever they found in the safe house below,

03:09:25.808 --> 03:09:31.421
tore through it, and placed whatever was important
to them in this area.

03:09:31.421 --> 03:09:34.107
SAM: They wanted this eye thing.

03:09:34.107 --> 03:09:38.181
LAURA: That was the whole reason they attacked
was-- what if they attack you now?

03:09:38.181 --> 03:09:40.807
TRAVIS: For what?

03:09:40.807 --> 03:09:43.050
LAURA and SAM: For having the thing inside of
you!

03:09:43.050 --> 03:09:45.989
TRAVIS: But you can't see it! I don't have it!

03:09:45.989 --> 03:09:47.588
LAURA and SAM: Maybe they can sense it.

03:09:47.588 --> 03:09:48.691
LAURA: Yeah!

03:09:48.691 --> 03:09:49.866
SAM: We solved it.

03:09:49.866 --> 03:09:51.506
LAURA: We solved the mystery.

03:09:51.506 --> 03:09:57.810
LIAM: I'm going to cast Dancing Lights and scour
the room. Is there anything we're missing?

03:09:57.810 --> 03:09:59.854
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:09:59.854 --> 03:10:01.275
TRAVIS: How big is the well?

03:10:01.275 --> 03:10:08.510
MATT: It's roughly five to eight feet in
diameter.

03:10:08.510 --> 03:10:11.904
ASHLEY: What happens if you look over, do you see
yourself?

03:10:11.904 --> 03:10:14.904
TRAVIS: Oh shit, that's not a bad call. I'll check
my reflection in the well.

03:10:14.904 --> 03:10:22.242
MATT: Okay. You look in the well, the water is
moving in there. It's you.

03:10:22.242 --> 03:10:24.910
TALIESIN: I'm going to push his head underneath
the water.

03:10:24.910 --> 03:10:30.132
MATT: (splashing water, sputtering) Salt water,
you start coughing for a minute and come up.

03:10:30.132 --> 03:10:31.886
TALIESIN: Anything?

03:10:31.886 --> 03:10:33.722
TRAVIS: (coughs once)

03:10:33.722 --> 03:10:36.303
LAURA: He's coughing up salt water again!

03:10:36.303 --> 03:10:37.643
SAM: Just like his dreams.

03:10:37.643 --> 03:10:39.293
TRAVIS: Try again.

03:10:39.293 --> 03:10:43.610
TALIESIN: Tap three times when you're done. Push
him under.

03:10:43.610 --> 03:10:46.159
SAM: Can you breathe? Can you breathe underwater?

03:10:46.159 --> 03:10:47.990
TRAVIS: (inhales)

03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:49.911
MATT: You are drowning.

03:10:49.911 --> 03:10:54.041
TRAVIS: I'm tapping like a motherfucker.

03:10:54.041 --> 03:10:58.075
MATT: You pull him out of the pool. He starts
coughing up the water.

03:10:58.075 --> 03:11:00.497
TRAVIS: (coughing)

03:11:00.497 --> 03:11:05.471
TALIESIN: We're even for the teleport now.

03:11:05.471 --> 03:11:07.601
LAURA: I don't think he's a mermaid anymore.

03:11:07.601 --> 03:11:11.180
TALIESIN: Of course, it's possible it hasn't
actually had an effect on you yet, either.

03:11:11.180 --> 03:11:13.802
SAM: Or it can only be on the full moon, or
something.

03:11:13.802 --> 03:11:15.849
TALIESIN: That doesn't make any sense.

03:11:15.849 --> 03:11:17.413
SAM: I know mythology.

03:11:17.413 --> 03:11:20.652
LAURA: Caleb, can you Detect Magic on Fjord? Can
you sense anything?

03:11:20.652 --> 03:11:23.451
LIAM: If you have 11 minutes to spare, yes I can.

03:11:23.451 --> 03:11:30.548
SAM: Can I just point out, not to be a jerk--

03:11:30.548 --> 03:11:32.642
TALIESIN: Is this about whales?

03:11:32.642 --> 03:11:34.615
LIAM: I begin ritual casting Detect Magic.

03:11:34.615 --> 03:11:39.509
MATT: As you're doing that, you do get the sense
that the longer you're here, in a nexus between

03:11:39.509 --> 03:11:45.596
these numerous merrow tunnels, the higher your
chance gets of having more arriving.

03:11:45.596 --> 03:11:47.408
LIAM: Oh man, ritual casting.

03:11:47.408 --> 03:11:49.492
LAURA: No, let's get out of here.

03:11:49.492 --> 03:11:55.172
TALIESIN: This place is definitely making me
nervous. We should do our best to cut off this

03:11:55.172 --> 03:11:57.648
particular flow-through.

03:11:57.648 --> 03:12:01.829
MARISHA: Maybe they were gathering a bunch of
these items because they were looking for the

03:12:01.829 --> 03:12:03.632
exact one for this one.

03:12:03.632 --> 03:12:05.882
TALIESIN: I think they were trying to activate it.
They were trying to please it.

03:12:05.882 --> 03:12:08.880
LAURA: Should we gather up all of the things and
put them back up in the tree?

03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:10.402
SAM: Can we put them all in the bag?

03:12:10.402 --> 03:12:13.331
TRAVIS: Anybody want any of the weapons?
Shortswords, longswords, battleaxes?

03:12:13.331 --> 03:12:16.191
TALIESIN: Let's leave it exactly where they're
supposed to be so we did our job.

03:12:16.191 --> 03:12:20.571
SAM: What do you mean, "where they're supposed to
be?" They stole it from the smugglers.

03:12:20.571 --> 03:12:24.674
TALIESIN: We're working for the smugglers. We'll
put it back in the safe house.

03:12:24.674 --> 03:12:27.148
LAURA: Okay, we'll take it all back upstairs.

03:12:27.148 --> 03:12:36.040
MATT: You guys gather up as much as you can, take
your way via the rope through the water, Kiri in

03:12:36.040 --> 03:12:41.838
tow. You make your way back up, handing things off
up into the tunnel. Eventually, over the next hour

03:12:41.838 --> 03:12:45.867
or so, get most of what was down there that you
could back up into the safe house.

03:12:45.867 --> 03:12:48.653
LAURA: Are any of the weapons that we found better
than my handaxe?

03:12:48.653 --> 03:12:52.056
MATT: I mean, they're all what they are.

03:12:52.056 --> 03:12:54.289
MARISHA: Any dope bos?

03:12:54.289 --> 03:12:55.911
LIAM: Just one.

03:12:55.911 --> 03:12:57.860
LAURA: You're Beau. You're looking for a staff?

03:12:57.860 --> 03:13:00.068
MARISHA: Bo staff?

03:13:00.068 --> 03:13:03.457
MATT: No quarterstaffs. They all appear to be
steel weapons that are part of this cache. There

03:13:03.457 --> 03:13:09.243
is a long polearm-- a halberd, there's two of
them-- that does have a shaft of wood, but it's

03:13:09.243 --> 03:13:14.913
designed for the weight of the bladed edge. You
could break it off and make it a quarterstaff if

03:13:14.913 --> 03:13:17.175
you really wanted to, but it would be comparable
to what you already have.

03:13:17.175 --> 03:13:18.872
MARISHA: No, I have a staff.

03:13:18.872 --> 03:13:22.458
SAM: Any shortswords better than my shortsword?

03:13:22.458 --> 03:13:24.144
MATT: They're well-made and fresh.

03:13:24.144 --> 03:13:31.354
SAM: I like mine. Do they seem sharper, or
deadlier?

03:13:31.354 --> 03:13:35.434
MATT: They're less worn, but they're not deadlier,
per se.

03:13:35.434 --> 03:13:37.398
TRAVIS: Who's holding onto the broken-off hilt?

03:13:37.398 --> 03:13:38.946
LAURA: I put it in the bag.

03:13:38.946 --> 03:13:40.509
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I carry that?

03:13:40.509 --> 03:13:43.944
TALIESIN: You know, yeah.

03:13:43.944 --> 03:13:50.041
LIAM: Can I take 30 seconds to see if it jogs my
memory since I'm such a history buff?

03:13:50.041 --> 03:13:51.625
MATT: Yeah, make a history check.

03:13:51.625 --> 03:13:53.151
MARISHA: Can I assist him on that?

03:13:53.151 --> 03:13:54.436
MATT: Sure.

03:13:54.436 --> 03:13:56.597
MARISHA: You have assistance. Roll with
advantage.

03:13:56.597 --> 03:14:02.573
LIAM: Nope. Big 13.

03:14:02.573 --> 03:14:07.013
MATT: Doesn't jog your memory. It looks old. Looks
like it's been around a while.

03:14:07.013 --> 03:14:12.117
MARISHA: Can I try and do it myself and do a ki
point thing?

03:14:12.117 --> 03:14:14.734
MATT: Unfortunately, you already aided somebody
with it.

03:14:14.734 --> 03:14:24.475
TALIESIN: He wants to do this. See if it does
anything. That's fair.

03:14:24.475 --> 03:14:27.606
LAURA: Don't try to stick this inside of you too,
though, okay?

03:14:27.606 --> 03:14:29.240
TRAVIS: No, I'm not.

03:14:29.240 --> 03:14:32.434
SAM: We're back up on the upper level?

03:14:32.434 --> 03:14:33.866
MATT: You guys are back in the safe house now,
yes.

03:14:33.866 --> 03:14:35.232
SAM: Should we blow up the tunnel?

03:14:35.232 --> 03:14:38.197
TALIESIN: If it's possible, I would love to cave
this thing in.

03:14:38.197 --> 03:14:39.588
MARISHA: Do you have boom sticks still?

03:14:39.588 --> 03:14:43.808
SAM: I don't, but two of us do. Wait, do I?

03:14:43.808 --> 03:14:46.295
TRAVIS: We have four sticks.

03:14:46.295 --> 03:14:55.787
LAURA: Won't the sound attract all of the things?
I feel like the sound will attract all of the

03:14:55.787 --> 03:14:58.107
merrow people.

03:14:58.107 --> 03:15:00.002
MARISHA: As long as we're not here.

03:15:00.002 --> 03:15:08.343
TALIESIN: I don't think they're going to come up
once we're out of here. They'd have to dig through.

03:15:08.343 --> 03:15:12.366
SAM: We have two of them among us.

03:15:12.366 --> 03:15:15.037
TALIESIN: Mind like a steel trap.

03:15:15.037 --> 03:15:16.096
LIAM: I do not have any.

03:15:16.096 --> 03:15:17.652
TRAVIS: I just said we have two sticks.

03:15:17.652 --> 03:15:20.177
LIAM: I heard that, but who's got them?

03:15:20.177 --> 03:15:23.319
MARISHA: Who's got the sticks? We've got sticks.

03:15:23.319 --> 03:15:31.470
LIAM: I also have a propeller beanie, and a bag of
chips, and-- I heard you say that. Who has them?

03:15:31.470 --> 03:15:33.230
SAM: I think it's Molly and Fjord.

03:15:33.230 --> 03:15:35.725
TALIESIN: I don't have any.

03:15:35.725 --> 03:15:39.316
ASHLEY: I have a tinderbox.

03:15:39.316 --> 03:15:41.056
TALIESIN: No, I don't have any.

03:15:41.056 --> 03:15:43.695
MATT: Amongst you, you have two of those. Whoever
has them, you're fine.

03:15:43.695 --> 03:15:45.335
LIAM: We're pretty sure we have them, guys.

03:15:45.335 --> 03:15:49.295
MARISHA: Light the damn sticks of dynamite! Just
do it!

03:15:49.295 --> 03:15:53.653
LAURA: Oh man, wait, but-- Oh, okay.

03:15:53.653 --> 03:15:54.966
MARISHA: What?

03:15:54.966 --> 03:15:58.136
LAURA: I wanted to check out those bodies that
were downstairs.

03:15:58.136 --> 03:15:59.196
TALIESIN: We did.

03:15:59.196 --> 03:16:02.809
LAURA: No, the human skeletons that were down.

03:16:02.809 --> 03:16:06.813
SAM: They were probably smugglers that were
keeping the safe house for the Gentleman.

03:16:06.813 --> 03:16:08.246
TALIESIN: We did check them.

03:16:08.246 --> 03:16:14.909
LAURA: They had manacles on them, though, didn't
they? That means they were slaves or something.

03:16:14.909 --> 03:16:17.318
SAM: Or taken prisoner.

03:16:17.318 --> 03:16:20.780
TALIESIN: There's lots you can do with manacles.

03:16:20.780 --> 03:16:22.198
TRAVIS: Okay, all right.

03:16:22.198 --> 03:16:23.820
MATT: What are you guys doing?

03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:26.669
LAURA: Blowing up a cave, I guess.

03:16:26.669 --> 03:16:28.403
TRAVIS: Climbing the rope back up top, to the base
of the tree.

03:16:28.403 --> 03:16:36.482
MATT: You guys get up, you all get ready to go.
You gather your things. (lighting dynamite) Watch

03:16:36.482 --> 03:16:43.652
it sparking. It disappears, you begin to leave. As
you guys are all walking out of the storehouse,

03:16:43.652 --> 03:16:51.244
from behind you, off to the left, there's a dull
sound, and some dirt and water from the left side

03:16:51.244 --> 03:16:58.829
of the tree in the middle of the hot afternoon
(muffled impact). The still water that currently

03:16:58.829 --> 03:17:06.871
exists around begins to slowly drain as a part of
the swamp off to the side sinks down about ten

03:17:06.871 --> 03:17:14.452
feet or so. The water level drops a solid foot,
but it comes to rest. You're sure that whatever

03:17:14.452 --> 03:17:21.620
structure that remained down there before is now
filled with dirt, sludge, swamp water, and rock.

03:17:21.620 --> 03:17:23.495
LIAM: I hope we brought Kiri with us.

03:17:23.495 --> 03:17:24.669
MATT: Kiri is with you.

03:17:24.669 --> 03:17:26.452
SAM: Oh my god!

03:17:26.452 --> 03:17:28.805
TRAVIS: "Why would they do that?!"

03:17:28.805 --> 03:17:33.494
ASHLEY: Can I take down the bodies that are on the
trees?

03:17:33.494 --> 03:17:35.384
MATT: Okay. Is anybody helping you with that?

03:17:35.384 --> 03:17:36.678
LAURA: Yeah, I'll help.

03:17:36.678 --> 03:17:37.750
LIAM: Nope.

03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:39.418
ASHLEY: Leave them to rest in peace.

03:17:39.418 --> 03:17:42.321
MATT: Jester and Yasha start taking down the
bloated bodies.

03:17:42.321 --> 03:17:45.618
LAURA: Why are we doing this?

03:17:45.618 --> 03:17:51.656
ASHLEY: So that people know that we took care of
it. So it's not a danger anymore.

03:17:51.656 --> 03:17:55.149
TALIESIN: And to rifle through their pockets, I
imagine.

03:17:55.149 --> 03:17:56.588
MATT, SAM and LAURA: We already did.

03:17:56.588 --> 03:17:58.305
SAM: We're the worst people ever.

03:17:58.352 --> 03:18:00.435
MATT: What are you doing with the bodies? Are you
leaving them in the swamp to fester?

03:18:00.435 --> 03:18:02.452
LAURA: Should we put them in the water or
something?

03:18:02.452 --> 03:18:06.610
ASHLEY: Yeah, food. It's the circle of life.

03:18:06.610 --> 03:18:13.820
MATT: (singing) Circle of-- You take them and pull
them off-site, and leave them in a pile to become

03:18:13.820 --> 03:18:17.880
one with the swamp over time. It's pretty gross
work.

03:18:17.880 --> 03:18:20.437
TALIESIN: You want swamp things? This is how you
get swamp things.

03:18:20.437 --> 03:18:29.030
MARISHA: While they bury bodies, I pull Caleb
aside, and say: hey, can I talk to you for five

03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:40.539
seconds? Ten, maybe, tops. 15. Okay, it might be
more like 20 seconds. Will you give me 20 seconds?

03:18:40.539 --> 03:18:50.293
Over here? No, you know what, it's fine. I can say
it in front of everybody. I'm sorry. I wanted to

03:18:50.293 --> 03:19:01.119
apologize for last night. I got a little
aggressive, a little handsy. I shouldn't have done

03:19:01.119 --> 03:19:11.630
that, I was out of line, and I shouldn't have
brought up your past shit. Sorry. See, 20 seconds,

03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:14.012
that was about right? That was good?

03:19:14.012 --> 03:19:19.378
TRAVIS: (whispers) Genuine.

03:19:19.378 --> 03:19:23.584
MARISHA: I'm-- He's just staring at me.

03:19:23.631 --> 03:19:26.758
LAURA: Caleb! Here's where you respond to her.

03:19:26.758 --> 03:19:30.948
MARISHA: You saw the worst side of me--

03:19:30.948 --> 03:19:44.219
LIAM: I give Beauregard a hug, and say: I don't
know what I'm doing. Just go with it.

03:19:44.219 --> 03:19:50.842
MARISHA: I look at Fjord over my shoulder.

03:19:50.842 --> 03:19:54.766
LIAM: I look to Yasha.

03:19:54.766 --> 03:19:57.797
MARISHA: I hug him back? Do I go like this?

03:19:57.797 --> 03:20:03.133
TRAVIS: Not too tight.

03:20:03.133 --> 03:20:04.859
ASHLEY: Pat, pat.

03:20:04.859 --> 03:20:08.507
SAM: This makes me feel awkward.

03:20:08.507 --> 03:20:09.942
LAURA: It's so uncomfortable.

03:20:09.942 --> 03:20:16.137
(applause)

03:20:16.137 --> 03:20:17.578
SAM: That was really good, guys!

03:20:17.578 --> 03:20:19.127
MATT: (like Nott) "Welcome to the Mighty Nein!"

03:20:19.127 --> 03:20:22.611
(laughter)

03:20:22.611 --> 03:20:35.089
LIAM: Caleb doesn't laugh like that at all.
(awkward laughing) That's not necessary.

03:20:35.089 --> 03:20:37.227
SAM: Yes it is, she was really rude to you and--

03:20:37.227 --> 03:20:45.406
LIAM: Not. Necessary. Working on it.

03:20:45.406 --> 03:20:46.977
TRAVIS: Nice job.

03:20:46.977 --> 03:21:00.278
MARISHA: Was it? I don't know how I feel about
that. Good talk, friend. Seriously though, friend?

03:21:00.278 --> 03:21:03.326
LIAM: Ja okay.

03:21:03.326 --> 03:21:08.123
MARISHA: Ja? How do you say it?

03:21:08.123 --> 03:21:09.634
TRAVIS: (coughing) Quit while you're ahead.

03:21:09.634 --> 03:21:12.233
MARISHA: All right. And I walk away.

03:21:12.233 --> 03:21:15.595
TALIESIN: Been a while.

03:21:15.595 --> 03:21:17.393
ASHLEY: It was good.

03:21:17.393 --> 03:21:22.006
LAURA: Hey Caleb, do you know how to find our way
out of this swamp?

03:21:22.006 --> 03:21:23.896
SAM: Find our way out?

03:21:23.896 --> 03:21:25.177
LIAM: Of course I do.

03:21:25.177 --> 03:21:26.861
LAURA: Yeah, aren't we done here?

03:21:26.861 --> 03:21:28.079
TALIESIN: We're done, we're heading out.

03:21:28.079 --> 03:21:31.432
SAM: I think we have (cocks crossbow) a troll
to find.

03:21:31.432 --> 03:21:38.036
TRAVIS: Drunk-ass fucking Nott, dwelling on old
shit.

03:21:38.089 --> 03:21:42.046
LIAM: You made Babs Tarr hide her head in her
laptop, man!

03:21:42.046 --> 03:21:49.570
SAM: Or we could just leave.

03:21:49.570 --> 03:21:51.741
ASHLEY: I mean, that is 100 gold.

03:21:51.741 --> 03:21:54.273
LAURA: Yeah, but he almost killed us like super
easy.

03:21:54.273 --> 03:22:00.469
TRAVIS: He bleeds death and stuff. We'd have to
hit him from afar. It might not be worth it.

03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:09.290
LIAM: Well, my friends, whatever we do, we are
really fucked up. At least Beauregard and I are

03:22:09.290 --> 03:22:10.735
really fucked up.

03:22:10.735 --> 03:22:14.293
LAURA: Well, I have a couple of level ones left.
Blam blam!

03:22:14.293 --> 03:22:17.694
SAM: Did you just Salt Bae them?

03:22:17.694 --> 03:22:22.313
MATT: That is now my new favorite--

03:22:22.313 --> 03:22:25.731
LAURA: That's great! You both heal 12 points!

03:22:25.731 --> 03:22:27.754
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! I'm almost up to full
now!

03:22:27.754 --> 03:22:31.534
MATT: I think Salt Bae cleric is my new favorite
idea for a character.

03:22:31.534 --> 03:22:32.822
ASHLEY: Was that for everyone?

03:22:32.822 --> 03:22:34.673
LAURA: No, that was just for them. I'm sorry,
Yasha.

03:22:34.673 --> 03:22:35.913
ASHLEY: No, it's fine.

03:22:35.913 --> 03:22:36.745
TALIESIN: That was a great roll.

03:22:36.745 --> 03:22:38.625
LIAM: Shit, let's go find Vecna!

03:22:38.625 --> 03:22:46.686
MATT: As you guys gather your things and begin to
trudge southward, back into the Labenda Swamp to

03:22:46.686 --> 03:22:53.744
make your way back to the city of Barleben, a bit
wounded, but you've succeeded in your first task

03:22:53.744 --> 03:23:01.883
for the Gentleman, you begin to make your way
through the reverse guidance of Caleb in the

03:23:01.883 --> 03:23:05.473
direction you were traveling. Backward guidance,
we'll put it that way.

03:23:05.473 --> 03:23:08.650
LIAM: Reverse math. We came from that direction
precisely.

03:23:08.650 --> 03:23:14.562
MATT: As you're all taking a moment to look
through, keeping your eyes peeled, weapons drawn,

03:23:14.562 --> 03:23:23.782
Fjord, your eyes catch the summoned falchion in
your hand, and there, glittering in the center of

03:23:23.782 --> 03:23:28.365
the hilt, where there was none previously, is a
single yellow eye.

03:23:28.365 --> 03:23:29.787
And that's where we're going to
end tonight's episode.

03:23:29.787 --> 03:23:31.688
(cheering)

03:23:31.688 --> 03:23:33.729
SAM: Wait, where was it?

03:23:33.729 --> 03:23:35.083
MATT: On the hilt of the blade.

03:23:35.083 --> 03:23:38.904
LIAM: Oh, that's a Final Fantasy VII Materia
rogue.

03:23:38.904 --> 03:23:40.377
MATT: That's Materia slot?

03:23:40.377 --> 03:23:43.615
LAURA: His sword keeps getting cooler and cooler.

03:23:43.615 --> 03:23:44.823
MARISHA: It does.

03:23:44.823 --> 03:23:46.769
MATT: It's like it's the basis of his class.

03:23:46.769 --> 03:23:49.299
LIAM: Bling it out, man. Bling that shit out.

03:23:49.299 --> 03:23:59.162
MATT: All right. We're going to pick up on that
next Thursday, as you guys return. Oh man, shit's

03:23:59.162 --> 03:24:03.781
getting interesting and weird. Thank you for
hanging with us. Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as

03:24:03.781 --> 03:24:07.976
we did. Thank you, Babs, for being awesome and
hanging out with us tonight. That was awesome.

03:24:07.976 --> 03:24:14.638
Have a wonderful week, we'll see you guys next
Thursday, we love you, and is it Thursday yet?

03:24:14.639 --> 03:37:10.608

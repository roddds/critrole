00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:03.034
MATT: Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of
us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play

00:00:03.034 --> 00:00:04.152
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:07.118
TRAVIS: Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons!

00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:13.948
MATT: Travis is in a good mood. Glad you guys can
join us. Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:17.816
let's get through some quick announcements. First
and foremost, we have our first sponsor for the

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:23.920
evening: our recurring friends at the wondrous D&amp;amp;D
Beyond. Sam, you said you were prepared in advance

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.007
for this one.

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:30.904
SAM: Well, I've been getting a lot of questions
lately about, like, how do you write these ad

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:37.844
things? I make it sound like, "Oh, I just come up
with it on the fly!" It's not true. I spend a lot

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:47.258
of time. In fact, I have a file here of rejected
ads that I didn't deem good enough to use to

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:53.068
promote our friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond. dndbeyond.com.
Go there, sign up, use their service like we do.

00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:59.832
Here's just a few. I'm just going to rifle through
my files. This one's terrible. It was a pirate

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:07.339
one, I was going to wear an eye patch, and go,
"Ahoy and welcome to D&amp;amp;D be-yarrrgh! Grab your

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:11.574
"duffel, set the binnacle and follow the
freebooters to DnD beyond dot carrrrrrm!" But it

00:01:11.574 --> 00:01:12.674
didn't make sense.

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:14.081
LAURA: No, that's terrible.

00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:17.669
SAM: This one was-- I was going to do a Travis
impression.

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:19.039
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:26.448
SAM: "Yo bros, how about that Cowboys game, right?
When Prescott hit Hurns on that outside post-route?"

00:01:26.448 --> 00:01:28.039
TRAVIS: Hurns doesn't play for them yet.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.835
SAM: Fuck. "I nearly spilled my Natty Lite all
over my Emmitt Smith commemorative Snuggie."

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.880
TRAVIS: It's a Troy Aikman Snuggie!

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.036
SAM: "Man, I love sports. The smell of grass, the
sound of marching bands, the sight of 22 men

00:01:46.036 --> 00:02:00.646
"pounding each other for--" All right. Here's an
early draft of the now-famous D&amp;amp;D Beyond jingle. I

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:04.543
went through many drafts of the lyrics before I
landed on the primo ones that we got.

00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:12.647
(sings) You got your perfect wizard, his tomes and his
supplies. But he burned his entire family to death

00:02:12.647 --> 00:02:14.692
and now he's traumatized.

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:20.313
(laughter)

00:02:20.313 --> 00:02:22.223
SAM: I thought that was a little too dark.

00:02:22.223 --> 00:02:23.992
LAURA: Yeah.

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:29.068
SAM: This one? What was this one? Our tests
indicate that your rash has spread to the groin

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:35.640
ar-- Nope, that's not it. That was a different
file. I had this one, this one's really

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.805
conceptual. Here, I'll do it. Matt.

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:39.747
MATT: Yes.

00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:40.954
SAM: Matt.

00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:42.273
MATT: Yes.

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:43.230
SAM: Matt.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.476
MATT: Yes.

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:45.527
SAM: Matt.

00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:46.974
MATT: Yes.

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:52.053
SAM: That's all it says. It just keeps going and
saying Matt. It wouldn't have worked! This is why

00:02:52.053 --> 00:02:56.205
it's rejected! Oh, this one. This one is specific
for--

00:02:56.205 --> 00:02:58.331
MATT: Very Tim and Eric of you, I respect that.

00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:02.656
SAM: We're all excited to meet Laura and Travis's
baby.

00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:04.020
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.274
SAM: So I consulted with some computer whizzes. We
did some facial recognition to find out what their

00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:11.583
baby might look like.

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:12.848
LAURA: Oh no.

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:14.278
MARISHA: Please tell me this is true.

00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:16.168
LAURA: No, what did you do?

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:20.602
SAM: It's got Travis's eyes, Laura's eyebrows, and
why don't you just feast your eyes?

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:22.030
LAURA: Oh jeez.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.970
SAM: On this beauty.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.356
LAURA: That is so terrifying.

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:29.079
TRAVIS: That is some Planet of the Apes.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.004
LAURA: It looks like a ferengi from Star Trek.

00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:34.244
SAM: It is definitely your mouth. That's Travis's
beard.

00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:38.615
TRAVIS: It's like just the chin strap part. That's
really Abe Lincoln of me.

00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:46.679
SAM: Then the other one I had was flowers for you
to say sorry for that last bit.

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:50.528
LAURA: Aww, they're wonderful. They're real!

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:54.415
SAM: That concludes the file, that's all I've got.
The other things in here were just the pictures

00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:55.838
that I cut out.

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:59.603
LAURA: Oh jeez, that's all--

00:03:59.603 --> 00:04:00.832
SAM: Yep.

00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:05.374
LAURA: Oh, I like that one.

00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:14.997
SAM: This is the final one. There's more rejected
ones, but I'll read you those another day.

00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:16.151
MATT: There we go.

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.266
LIAM: BB! I want shaved ice, BB!

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:21.090
SAM: I got my flask for tonight.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.051
LAURA: You asshole.

00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:33.681
MARISHA: Anthony Kiedis! That's who that picture
looked like! I had to remember his name. Show it

00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:37.593
again! It's Anthony Kiedis! I'm just saying!

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:39.752
MATT: Yeah, I can see it.

00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:43.487
LAURA: The flowers are a little more bitter right
now.

00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:45.608
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.

00:04:45.608 --> 00:04:47.276
MARISHA: Look look look!

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:48.781
TRAVIS: That's Anthony Kiedis.

00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:53.324
SAM: It really is Anthony Kiedis. We'll do a side
by side. We'll put it on Twitter. We'll post it

00:04:53.324 --> 00:05:02.380
later. But all of that is to say, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.
Thank you.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.077
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:10.801
TRAVIS: What a look into the future. And what a
bright future at that.

00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:16.086
MATT: Our second sponsor for the night actually
comes from inside the family. Those of you who are

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:20.274
familiar with our first campaign got to see him
performing as Garthok for one of our guest

00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:24.728
episodes, and he's been on a number of shows here
at Geek &amp;amp; Sundry. He helped write the theme song

00:05:24.728 --> 00:05:29.312
for Critical Role. Actually, he wrote the theme
song for our show, amongst many other songs for

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:35.426
the series. Jason Charles Miller has a new album
coming out this week called In the Wasteland.

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:37.565
SAM: That's amazing.

00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:41.582
MATT: The art looks really cool, the design there.
It's available now. You can find it wherever else

00:05:41.582 --> 00:05:47.006
music is streamed or sold; you can buy an
autographed physical CD copy of it from Jason's

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:53.124
website, which is jasoncharlesmiller.com. If you
like rock, country or metal music, anything in

00:05:53.124 --> 00:05:57.463
between, you'll probably like this album. If
you've ever heard his previous work, it's pretty

00:05:57.463 --> 00:06:01.548
badass actually. I'm very picky with my music and
his stuff is great so check it out, I hope you

00:06:01.548 --> 00:06:05.473
like it. We have a great little video at the break
also to discuss this fantastic album. So thank

00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:13.559
you, Jason, and I hope you guys enjoy his new
stuff. Moving on. We made the really exciting

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:19.265
announcement earlier this week. If you haven't
seen: we launched our new online store and we're

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:22.477
working on brand new shows for our YouTube
and Twitch channel.

00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:24.027
LAURA: Are none of us wearing the new shirt?

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:25.542
SAM: Oh wow.

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:26.868
MARISHA: Shit.

00:06:26.868 --> 00:06:28.713
TRAVIS: (with mouth full of food) I'll put it on
at the break. I've got it right here. I'll put it

00:06:28.713 --> 00:06:30.247
on when we get to the break. I'll put it on.

00:06:30.247 --> 00:06:31.494
LAURA: Wow.

00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:32.817
LIAM: Gobble Gobble.

00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:34.068
LAURA: Keep going, Matt.

00:06:34.068 --> 00:06:43.388
MATT: We have also put up on Critrole.com shop the
new Mighty Nein shirt. It's already selling out

00:06:43.388 --> 00:06:48.870
really fast in a lot of sizes, but we already have
more ordered that are coming in, so we'll update

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.325
you guys as soon as those come in.

00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:54.793
LAURA: Only small, medium and 4XL are sold out
right now. Everything else is still in there.

00:06:54.793 --> 00:07:00.656
MATT: If you are of those sizes that are sold out,
we'll have more soon. We're super excited about

00:07:00.656 --> 00:07:07.445
all the things coming up. Critical Role and Talks
Machina will still be here on the Geek &amp;amp; Sundry

00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:12.555
Twitch and in Alpha, so do not worry. All the new
stuff will be coming on our own channels and let

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:18.301
you guys know as soon as things come forward.
Super stoked about that. Also, wanted to let you

00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:22.683
guys know friends of ours in the community, I know
that some of you guys are familiar with Web DM

00:07:22.683 --> 00:07:27.773
they do fantastic work, fantastic streams and
they're doing, on June 24th at 1:00pm Central

00:07:27.773 --> 00:07:35.519
Time, this weekend, a fantastic fundraiser D&amp;amp;D
stream. With a wonderful all-female cast: we have

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:40.453
Satine Phoenix, Lysa Chen, Autumn Umphress, Syd
Shields and the DM Emma Lambert will be running

00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:48.284
for the benefit of The Girls Empowerment Network
in Texas. Tune in at twitch.tv/webdm or

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:53.158
twitch.tv/criticalrole. We'll be hosting them as
well so you can check it out. It's going to be a

00:07:53.158 --> 00:07:56.866
wonderful game with good people involved and a
great charitable event that you can help be a part

00:07:56.866 --> 00:07:58.851
of the cause. So look forward to that.

00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:00.455
LIAM: Not to be confused with WebMD.

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:05.534
MATT: No. The standard editions of Vox Machina:
Origins, the comic, are still available through

00:08:05.534 --> 00:08:11.521
Geek &amp;amp; Sundry and Alpha online shops. Details are
at critrole.com. Talks Machina is every Tuesday

00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:16.449
evening at 7:00PM Pacific where our fantastic host
Brian W. Foster talks about the episode that's

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:21.701
happening tonight next week. Watch us next week
and a few of us will be there, present, to discuss

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:27.529
what will transpire. I believe that is it and that
is all for the announcements. Anything else guys

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:30.201
or shall we--?

00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:32.042
SAM: Short and sweet.

00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:38.896
MATT: Then, without further ado: let's jump in to
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:43.944
[click, TV static]

00:08:43.944 --> 00:09:55.416
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:12.804
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back. That's
good. Last we left off: The Mighty Nein had

00:10:12.804 --> 00:10:19.363
completed their first of two ventures they agreed
to complete in the name of The Gentleman. Heading

00:10:19.363 --> 00:10:25.763
northward towards Berleben, traversing the
dangerous Labenda Swamp, freeing the once

00:10:25.763 --> 00:10:32.322
endangered safe house from the encroaching merrow
dangers that had destroyed and decimated the

00:10:32.322 --> 00:10:36.924
people that were working there at the time and
freeing it up for future use. You had acquired a

00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:41.384
bird friend in the tiny Kiri that is along with
you, dagger in hand.

00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:42.935
TRAVIS: Six hit points.

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:44.844
MATT: Yeah. That's fine. You'll be fine.

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:46.367
MARISHA: She's going to die.

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:49.941
MATT: You gathered your things and went back to
the open road where you headed to the crossroads,

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:55.112
did some trading. Through the evening, jumped into
a few old friends who were looking to rob you,

00:10:55.112 --> 00:11:01.709
sent them on their way. Then continued northward
until eventually you came upon the outskirts of

00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:10.925
the-- what was it-- Silberquel Ridge-- there we
go, brain not working-- to the gnomish city of

00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:18.173
Hupperdook. Upon arriving in the city, you took in
the industrial sites: the elements of it that are

00:11:18.173 --> 00:11:27.310
heavy machinery and the creation of new types of
clockwork-based technologies, the stacks of soot

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:33.605
and steam sent outward, the war machines being
developed for use to the eastern lines where the

00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:40.700
conflict with Xhorhas is now brewing. You made a
friend by the name of Rissa who said, in exchange

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.665
for a round drinks in the evening, would show you
around the town for a bit. Upon making your way to

00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:52.395
the upper level, you were given a brief tour of
the vicinity which seemed strangely empty. The

00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:59.026
streets very well decorated for some seeming
celebration, but nobody present. As the sun slowly

00:11:59.026 --> 00:12:07.082
went down, the town came to life as all the work
whistles blew, the sounds of merriment began. And

00:12:07.082 --> 00:12:14.726
suddenly, as the sun goes vanishing behind the
distant mountains, the golds and oranges and

00:12:14.726 --> 00:12:20.903
subtle purples of the sunset begin to take over,
the sound of music and laughter begins to take the

00:12:20.903 --> 00:12:28.805
streets. So, Mighty Nein, what would you like to
do?

00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:35.941
TRAVIS: Laughter and music? I don't trust laughter
and music.

00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:42.105
SAM: Were we on our way to something? Were we
going to some place?

00:12:42.105 --> 00:12:44.441
LAURA: The Blushing Tankard? Is that where we were
going?

00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:47.214
SAM: Blushing Tankard, is that a place to stay?

00:12:47.214 --> 00:12:50.363
LAURA: It was a tavern. Rissa?

00:12:50.363 --> 00:12:51.760
MATT: "Right, yeah?"

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.795
LAURA: There's a big party happening now!

00:12:53.795 --> 00:12:55.927
MATT: "Like I said, welcome to Hupperdook."

00:12:55.927 --> 00:12:59.946
LAURA: Wha-- Should we-- Should we party?

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:03.094
MATT: "Well, I mean, what else is there to do for
the night here but that?"

00:13:03.094 --> 00:13:05.380
SAM: We don't know. We just got here.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.490
MATT: "There's nothing else to do! You've arrived,
go and get your stuff somewhere and let's have a drink!"

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.622
TALIESIN: Let's go get out stuff somewhere.

00:13:10.622 --> 00:13:12.058
MATT: "You owe me a round anyway."

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.568
TRAVIS: Is this every night or just-- It is.

00:13:14.568 --> 00:13:18.462
MATT: "Yeah. It's part of our culture, our gnomish
heritage."

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:19.931
LAURA: Why?

00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:27.511
MATT: "Why? Because it keeps us working hard every
day. Sure, maybe our general longevity, for

00:13:27.778 --> 00:13:34.100
"gnomes, is a little shorter than most, but what a
life we lead." She reaches out and she's leaning

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.406
out the cart as you guys are heading through the
street. These kids run by with sparklers in their

00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:40.089
hands and she reaches out and plucks them from
their hand and picks it up it's all (popping)

00:13:40.089 --> 00:13:42.022
around and she passes it over.

00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:44.432
SAM: Ooh what-- (yelling and blowing)

00:13:44.432 --> 00:13:47.078
LAURA: No, it's cool!

00:13:50.018 --> 00:13:52.373
SAM: Oh, are you drawing something? It's a dick.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:54.208
LAURA: (gasping)

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.294
SAM: I knew it!

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:57.793
LAURA: I was going to write dick!

00:13:57.793 --> 00:13:59.417
SAM: Oh, you didn't even need to.

00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:02.500
LAURA: I didn't!

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.534
MATT: "I can already see I'm going to like you
folks!"

00:14:05.883 --> 00:14:08.451
TRAVIS: Wow. Work hard, play hard.

00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:10.507
MATT: "That's the way we do here."

00:14:10.507 --> 00:14:12.133
LAURA: I like this town.

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:13.547
TRAVIS: Should we drop our shit off and--

00:14:13.547 --> 00:14:17.057
SAM: Where are we dropping? Can we stay at this
place as well or do we--

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:18.718
MATT: "You can."

00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:23.537
SAM: Give me that! I want to smell it.

00:14:23.537 --> 00:14:28.588
TRAVIS: Quick question. This Blushing Tankard
tavern, the doors lock, right? There's privacy,

00:14:28.588 --> 00:14:32.100
it's not like some fucking free-for-all all night,
is it?

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.818
MATT: "Well, in the tavern."

00:14:33.818 --> 00:14:35.844
TRAVIS: Upstairs, in the rooms, I assume they
have--

00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:37.322
MATT: "Oh, you can lock the doors!"

00:14:37.322 --> 00:14:41.449
TRAVIS: I'm just asking. I don't know! Could be
free love and a bunch of crazy people roaming

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:42.924
around, I don't know!

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:44.089
MARISHA: It is called the Blushing Tankard.

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:44.846
TRAVIS: Right?

00:14:44.846 --> 00:14:45.972
MARISHA: Why is it blushing?

00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:47.493
MATT: "Because you put your lips to it."

00:14:47.493 --> 00:14:48.918
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:14:48.918 --> 00:14:49.648
LAURA: Because why?

00:14:49.648 --> 00:14:51.618
SAM: Because you put your lips to it.

00:14:51.618 --> 00:14:53.049
LAURA: Oh.

00:14:53.049 --> 00:14:55.005
TRAVIS: Yeah. We're in for a fucki-- Okay.

00:14:55.005 --> 00:14:57.549
LAURA: Lead the way!

00:14:57.549 --> 00:15:04.186
MARISHA: Do I see anyone selling glow sticks?

00:15:04.186 --> 00:15:06.575
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:15:06.575 --> 00:15:08.054
MARISHA: Light up swords.

00:15:08.054 --> 00:15:10.107
TRAVIS: Fiber optic whips.

00:15:10.107 --> 00:15:12.285
MARISHA: I want a fiber optic whip.

00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:15.551
MATT: Candy necklaces, big giant pacifiers.

00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:19.270
MARISHA: That's not great. Nine.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:27.724
MATT: What you see is waves of fast moving
families and people. Gnomish, some dwarves, a few

00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:33.953
human-sized folks rushing by. It looks like some
of them are rushing from work to get home to

00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:38.850
disrobe from all their dirty clothes and jump back
out with their party attire, or they're already on

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.479
their way to wherever their destination is. You
hear fireworks going off in the distance and the

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:51.036
occasional flashes in the sky. But you don't see
any vendors at this juncture. At this point, who's

00:15:51.036 --> 00:15:53.374
helming the cart and the horses?

00:15:53.374 --> 00:15:54.752
LAURA: Fjord.

00:15:54.752 --> 00:15:55.784
TRAVIS: I am.

00:15:55.784 --> 00:16:00.866
MATT: Okay. Rissa saddles up, sits right in the
little bench next to you at the front of the cart

00:16:00.866 --> 00:16:05.542
and takes part of the reins. "Helping to guide you
to where you're trying to get to go. Follow me.

00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:09.676
"Tug to the right and it's got about two blocks
down that way. It's going to be hard to miss. Look

00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:14.432
"for the large arch with the various spiraling ivy
vines against it."

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.965
TRAVIS: Very nice of you. Can I keep an eye on her
hands just to make sure she's not going through my

00:16:16.965 --> 00:16:18.545
pockets while she's up here?

00:16:18.545 --> 00:16:21.167
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check.

00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:23.954
TRAVIS: 15.

00:16:23.954 --> 00:16:31.502
MATT: During this travel, as you're keeping an eye
out, she seems to be just focused on the task at hand.

00:16:31.502 --> 00:16:33.966
TRAVIS: I feel a little guilty, but not much.

00:16:33.966 --> 00:16:38.609
LAURA: That means that her sleight of hand is
better than your perception. That's all it means.

00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:41.845
MATT: That's what it could mean, or she could just
not be trying to steal from you, but it could be

00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:51.400
either. You don't know. After pulling around the
side, you come to this large celebration square

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.747
where there are three stages set up. There is a
large maypole in the center, and they're currently

00:16:56.747 --> 00:17:03.446
lifting up and tethering these large colorful
streamers of multiple colors. People are gathering

00:17:03.446 --> 00:17:11.101
baskets of flowers. A few get tossed and you catch
it, and they're made of cloth. You get the sense

00:17:11.101 --> 00:17:17.035
here that they don't have access to a lot of fresh
flowers here in Hupperdook based on the rocky

00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:24.416
terrain and the perpetual tossing of soot and ash
into the atmosphere. Also, if the celebration is

00:17:24.416 --> 00:17:33.023
that often they probably continue to reuse the
same elements over and over again. As you come

00:17:33.023 --> 00:17:39.306
over into this corner, there are bands starting to
play, music being set up on the outside, people

00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:44.708
are starting to sit down with blankets and
families are starting to gather in this area. To

00:17:44.708 --> 00:17:49.880
your left, you see the large ivory archway with
the ivy that's twisting across the top of it.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:56.193
Rissa reaches and tugs your hands to the left to
gear the cart in that direction and goes, "All

00:17:56.193 --> 00:18:03.240
"right, Blushing Tankard right up this way."
There's more laughter and there are two vendors

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:12.686
now on the outside, one of which is currently
selling flower necklaces or bands. The other has

00:18:12.686 --> 00:18:15.827
clusters of sparklers and firecrackers.

00:18:15.827 --> 00:18:17.905
TRAVIS: There's some of them now. Am I stopping?

00:18:17.905 --> 00:18:22.268
MARISHA: Just keep it going, I'm just going to--
and I just roll off.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.924
TALIESIN: I'll follow.

00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:27.123
LAURA: Beau, get me some too, Beau! Get me some,
too.

00:18:27.123 --> 00:18:30.190
MARISHA: Okay, I go up to the sparklers and
firecrackers.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.544
MATT: You walk up, and there's a young gnomish man
in what would be the equivalent of his late teens,

00:18:34.544 --> 00:18:39.565
or early twenties, got a very prominent Adam's
apple, and very thin for some of the gnomes you've

00:18:39.565 --> 00:18:43.597
seen around there. He glances up to you, holding a
small barrel filled with various small-scale

00:18:43.597 --> 00:18:47.010
explosives. "Hi, can I help you?"

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.155
MARISHA: I want three of everything.

00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:51.699
MATT: "Three, all right. I'll just get this
together."

00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:54.150
MARISHA: How much comes in a pack?

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.018
MATT: "Well, do you want three of everything, or do
you want a pack?"

00:18:57.018 --> 00:18:59.054
MARISHA: They come in packs?

00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:00.718
TRAVIS: We're going to lose a finger before the
night's done.

00:19:00.718 --> 00:19:02.451
SAM: Did you just change your shirt, Travis?

00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:03.802
TRAVIS: Yeah, bitch.

00:19:03.802 --> 00:19:05.259
SAM: How did that happen?

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:06.359
TRAVIS: Hocus pocus, motherfucker.

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:08.509
SAM: Sorry, focus!

00:19:08.509 --> 00:19:11.193
MATT: "Packs of ten."

00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:14.330
MARISHA: Ten? Ten sparklers or ten poppers?

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.309
MATT: "Packs for both of ten."

00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:18.704
MARISHA: Yeah, I want one of each. Pack of each.

00:19:18.704 --> 00:19:21.619
MATT: "All right, pack of each. That will be five
silver."

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.200
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.306
TRAVIS: I slow down just a little bit and give her
time.

00:19:25.306 --> 00:19:26.766
SAM: I don't think she's coming.

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:31.257
MARISHA: Then I also get a flower necklace for
Jester.

00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:36.840
MATT: "Oh that's--" on the other side, the next
person over there, a portly-looking fellow in his

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:44.695
middle ages or so, resting inside of his neck,
rescinded inside. "Hi, yeah, the flowers are going

00:19:44.695 --> 00:19:50.899
to run about five copper per string. So do you
want just one?"

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:54.834
MARISHA: I'll, ah--

00:19:56.499 --> 00:19:57.699
TRAVIS: Bring him with us!

00:19:58.172 --> 00:20:02.702
MATT: He's got a bunch of them tied up in his
hair and hanging off his neck.

00:20:03.567 --> 00:20:05.338
MARISHA: Do you also do braids?

00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:10.103
MATT: "Braids are across the way over there. Cindy
does the braids."

00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:13.036
MARISHA: I'll just take one.

00:20:13.036 --> 00:20:15.197
MATT: "All right, that's five copper, thank you."

00:20:15.197 --> 00:20:18.299
TRAVIS: Please tell me he has a shortsword and can
fight.

00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:22.407
MATT: You're going to keep collecting pathetic
characters to fight with you?

00:20:22.407 --> 00:20:27.827
TRAVIS: Yes, please, bring Kiri and that guy I'll
be happy every fight.

00:20:28.168 --> 00:20:31.299
MATT: It's the best front line you can hope for.

00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:34.902
MARISHA: I catch up, and I give Jester the flower
necklace.

00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:38.566
TRAVIS: As she starts to roll up I go: Hyah! And
just take off.

00:20:38.566 --> 00:20:41.519
MARISHA: (grunting)

00:20:41.882 --> 00:20:50.001
LAURA: Oh, no I'm get-- (grunting) Is that for me?
Beau, its beautiful!

00:20:50.001 --> 00:20:52.251
MARISHA: It looked like you. I'm sorry if it
smells weird.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:58.036
LAURA: Wait, I guess it'd have to be like this.
It's beautiful!

00:20:58.036 --> 00:21:02.095
MARISHA: I take out one of the poppers, and I throw
it! On the ground, what happens?

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.719
MATT: (bouncing)

00:21:03.719 --> 00:21:10.139
MARISHA: Shit! I jump out, and I go pick it up,
it's too valuable. I run back.

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:13.301
MATT: You go back and look at it, and you realize
there is actually a tiny little fuse on it.

00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:17.450
MARISHA: Oh, there's a process, okay. I jump back
on. Caleb, light it!

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.744
LIAM: No, you throw it.

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.838
MARISHA: Okay! Oh, like skeet shooting!

00:21:20.838 --> 00:21:22.119
LIAM: Yeah, throw it in the air.

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:23.270
MARISHA: Okay! (whoosh)

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.290
LIAM: Fire Bolt.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.225
MATT: Roll for an attack.

00:21:25.225 --> 00:21:26.899
SAM: Fire Bolt?

00:21:27.563 --> 00:21:29.940
TRAVIS: It incinerates the fiber.

00:21:30.297 --> 00:21:32.925
LIAM: Pretty good. That's 19 plus something.

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:36.837
MATT: You don't even have to roll damage. She
tosses it in the air and it arcs, this tiny little

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:42.301
firecracker, this little gray rod and then this
little streak of flame fires up and hits it. It

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:49.023
detonates with this loud pop! sound and you see
sparks around it. It dissipates a moment after and

00:21:49.023 --> 00:21:54.896
in the vicinity, about seven or eight nearby
gnomes, two of which children, all go, "(gasp)

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:57.206
"Yeah!" Start clapping and cheering.

00:21:57.206 --> 00:21:58.288
MARISHA: You see that? I'm their hero.

00:21:58.288 --> 00:22:00.007
LIAM: How did you do it?

00:22:00.007 --> 00:22:01.585
TRAVIS: Yeah, different fingers, but sure. I like
it.

00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:09.795
MARISHA: This is amazing, these could be useful.

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:12.431
LIAM: For shits and giggles or what do you have
in mind?

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:16.876
MARISHA: For distractions. We could do that again
and like when we're fighting people--

00:22:16.876 --> 00:22:17.839
TRAVIS: Diversions.

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:19.043
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:22:19.043 --> 00:22:21.517
LIAM: Sure, it went very good in the swamp with
that little one.

00:22:21.517 --> 00:22:24.706
SAM: Well. Can I have one to examine?

00:22:24.706 --> 00:22:26.419
TRAVIS: Say no.

00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:28.157
SAM: You have a bunch of them.

00:22:28.157 --> 00:22:29.506
MARISHA: How many is in a pack?

00:22:29.506 --> 00:22:31.660
MATT: Ten, so you have nine now.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.342
MARISHA: I might have to get more before we leave
this town.

00:22:34.342 --> 00:22:36.434
LAURA: I think that's smart.

00:22:36.434 --> 00:22:40.739
SAM: Matt, how much do we know about black
powder?

00:22:40.739 --> 00:22:46.407
MATT: Well, communally, not much at all. You, make
an intelligence check and have advantage because

00:22:46.407 --> 00:22:49.329
of your alchemical history.

00:22:49.329 --> 00:22:52.329
SAM: Okay, I'll take the first roll.
Intelligence?

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:53.748
MATT: Yes.

00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:55.016
SAM: 18.

00:22:55.016 --> 00:23:04.278
MATT: You know it's had minor applications for a
while, but it's only really been applied in very

00:23:04.278 --> 00:23:11.823
condensed and common use for, like the explosives
you found in the mine, clearing out spaces in

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:16.228
underground caverns, or for the detonation of
localized rocks that are in the way of paths

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:22.069
trying to be put in mountain ranges. Small scale
black powder like this you haven't encountered,

00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:28.673
really, so this seems to be a relatively new use
of this particular compound.

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:34.780
SAM: Up to this point, it's been rare that I or
we've come across anything?

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:40.566
MATT: You've barely come across it at all. You've
read about it. Actually, the dynamite sticks you

00:23:40.566 --> 00:23:46.337
found in the mine were probably the first ones you
encountered in your experience. Not a lot of use

00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:51.111
for it in the small farming town of Felderwin.

00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:53.992
LAURA: Would I have seen fireworks before in
Nicodranas?

00:23:53.992 --> 00:24:00.112
MATT: You have before, but they're saved for very
rare occasions, like the coming of a ship that's

00:24:00.112 --> 00:24:05.621
been long gone from shore or particular times of
the year for celebrations they would go off and

00:24:05.621 --> 00:24:09.226
for that in particular they would put ship barges
out on the water and they would fire them up from

00:24:09.226 --> 00:24:15.769
the waterfront. Having it this close is intense
and even that small burst right there, there was a

00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:19.173
flash of heat that you haven't really had before
and it's really exciting.

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:25.480
LIAM: Are we just in an ocean of gnomes; is it
like 98% gnomes all around us?

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:34.451
MATT: Most everyone you see here is gnomish.
You've seen a handful of dwarves, that's the next

00:24:34.451 --> 00:24:42.721
prominent people that live here and then a
smattering of human and half-elf. Right now, you

00:24:42.721 --> 00:24:46.420
guys have just come to the outside of The Blushing
Tankard.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.269
LIAM: I'm traveling with my hood up, minor detail,
as you were.

00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:51.944
LAURA: Let's go inside!

00:24:51.944 --> 00:24:55.415
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're here. Is there a hitching post
in the front?

00:24:55.415 --> 00:24:56.574
MATT: There is.

00:24:56.574 --> 00:24:58.815
TRAVIS: Yeah! Hitch up the horses.

00:24:58.815 --> 00:25:00.473
MATT: Okay.

00:25:00.473 --> 00:25:03.231
LAURA: You think it's safe? I don't think it's
safe.

00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:06.421
TRAVIS: They seem real jovial-like.

00:25:06.421 --> 00:25:11.567
LIAM: When people have libations they get up to
hijinks at night, and that seems like the main activity here.

00:25:11.567 --> 00:25:14.416
TRAVIS: You want to go in and secure us some
rooms, and I'll watch the carriage. Figure out if

00:25:14.416 --> 00:25:16.885
there's somewhere else we need to keep it?

00:25:16.885 --> 00:25:19.384
LIAM: I pull out the silver thread and I start
going around the horses.

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:21.072
TRAVIS: Oh! Or that.

00:25:21.072 --> 00:25:25.618
LAURA: Hey Nott, have you ever been dancing
before?

00:25:25.618 --> 00:25:30.124
SAM: Have I ever been dancing before? Like to a
place like this?

00:25:30.124 --> 00:25:31.395
LAURA: Yeah.

00:25:31.395 --> 00:25:32.372
SAM: I've danced.

00:25:32.372 --> 00:25:34.427
LAURA: Okay, just making sure.

00:25:34.427 --> 00:25:36.815
SAM: Why, are we dancing?

00:25:36.815 --> 00:25:38.638
LAURA: I figure we're going to dance tonight.

00:25:38.638 --> 00:25:40.135
TALIESIN: Probably inevitably.

00:25:40.135 --> 00:25:44.374
SAM: All right. I might need some liquor.

00:25:47.542 --> 00:25:53.237
MATT: You guys, leaving Caleb and-- you're staying
with Caleb while he sets up the perimeter.

00:25:53.237 --> 00:25:55.067
TRAVIS: Yeah, while he does the string.

00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:56.436
SAM: Do we need to choreograph something?

00:25:56.436 --> 00:26:00.521
LAURA: (gasps) We probably should. We should
probably get Kiri involved.

00:26:00.521 --> 00:26:03.519
SAM: That sounds adorable.

00:26:04.665 --> 00:26:09.320
LAURA: Come on Kiri.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.120
TALIESIN: Definitely going to need a drink for
this.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.868
TRAVIS: We're going to lose her tonight.

00:26:20.594 --> 00:26:26.169
MATT: As you guys enter the Blushing Tankard
Tavern, it is one of the larger taverns you've

00:26:26.169 --> 00:26:34.914
been in. The floor space has 20 or so round tables
scattered amongst the floor. There is a stage in

00:26:34.914 --> 00:26:39.317
the far back where the music hasn't quite started
yet, but there are musicians setting up. You can

00:26:39.317 --> 00:26:45.773
see a violinist who's currently tuning. There is a
piano in the back, and outside a couple of taverns

00:26:45.773 --> 00:26:51.666
you saw in Zadash, and your experiences from when
you were on the coast, pianos aren't as common in

00:26:51.666 --> 00:26:59.065
tavern spaces. Usually reserved for the upper
class, for private performances or higher-end

00:26:59.065 --> 00:27:05.318
social events. However, the tables are filling up
already, people are rushing in there. Food is

00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:11.663
passed around left and right. In the back, there's
a group of gnomes that are currently clapping the

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:16.629
ground on their table, singing some sort of tune,
a shanty. One of them is up on the table, clapping

00:27:16.629 --> 00:27:22.730
his legs there. One of the barmaids comes by and
slaps him. "Get off the table!"

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.121
LAURA: This place is great!

00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:26.952
SAM: It's really nice.

00:27:26.952 --> 00:27:29.385
MATT: What would you guys like to do?

00:27:29.385 --> 00:27:30.727
MARISHA: Try to get some rooms.

00:27:30.727 --> 00:27:32.657
TALIESIN: Let's get some rooms and stow our stuff
and get out there.

00:27:32.657 --> 00:27:34.520
LAURA: I want to go try to play the piano.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.467
MATT: All right.

00:27:35.467 --> 00:27:36.318
SAM: Right away?

00:27:36.318 --> 00:27:37.147
LAURA: Yes!

00:27:37.147 --> 00:27:38.000
SAM: Do you play the piano?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.169
LAURA: I've played it a little bit at home.

00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:43.778
LIAM: I want to listen. I'm going to sit close
by.

00:27:43.778 --> 00:27:45.322
MARISHA: Molly and I will go.

00:27:45.322 --> 00:27:52.564
LAURA: I have a lot of really good songs that I
learned when I was growing up. I'm going to sit

00:27:52.564 --> 00:27:55.056
down and try to play Chopsticks.

00:27:55.056 --> 00:27:58.608
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a performance
check.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.864
LAURA: Oh yeah, it's an eight!

00:28:03.864 --> 00:28:07.820
MATT and LAURA: (poorly playing Chopsticks)

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:12.767
MATT: There's a few moments of this going on
before you suddenly hear this (throat clearing).

00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:16.914
You turn over your left shoulder and
there is a half-elven gentlemen in a very nice

00:28:16.914 --> 00:28:21.927
doublet, who is currently holding a handful of
sheet music. "Um, you're at my piano."

00:28:22.343 --> 00:28:28.729
LAURA: (poorly playing Chopsticks)

00:28:28.729 --> 00:28:37.832
MATT: He twitches at the off-tune hammering of the
keys. "I'll be right back." He turns around and

00:28:37.832 --> 00:28:43.055
wanders off for the moment, clearing his ear with
his pinky. You guys go to get rooms?

00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:44.267
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:28:44.267 --> 00:28:48.701
MATT: You head to the front, it's a very long bar
that wraps around the right side of the entire

00:28:48.701 --> 00:28:55.356
chamber. It has two hatches that can open up. From
the inside, you see two individuals. You see a

00:28:55.356 --> 00:29:01.012
male gnome with a massive mane of red hair. Clean
shaven, middle age, and he's smiling and running

00:29:01.012 --> 00:29:06.464
around, getting drinks, sliding them down the bar,
filling things. He's the gnomish redhead

00:29:06.464 --> 00:29:13.322
equivalent of Tom Cruise. Spinning the bottles and
pouring them out. On the other side you see a

00:29:13.322 --> 00:29:20.536
female dwarf, with this awesome, well-kept,
chinstrap beard who has beautiful eye makeup on

00:29:20.536 --> 00:29:27.976
and this very colorful, silk, billowing blouse
that tapers at the wrist with a flourish. She's

00:29:27.976 --> 00:29:33.580
currently filling out drink and snack orders, and
they're both workhorses. They both have smiles on

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:38.719
their faces, and they're chatting with regulars.
You haven't quite caught their eye yet, they're in

00:29:38.719 --> 00:29:40.438
the midst of other business.

00:29:40.438 --> 00:29:42.166
LAURA: Did you say she was a dwarf?

00:29:42.166 --> 00:29:44.586
MATT: A dwarf, yeah.

00:29:44.586 --> 00:29:47.997
MARISHA: Who do we talk to? Do we talk to the
gnome or the dwarf?

00:29:47.997 --> 00:29:50.817
TALIESIN: Whichever one we catch the eye of
first.

00:29:50.817 --> 00:29:53.522
MARISHA: Yeah, we should do the bar lean in
thing.

00:29:53.522 --> 00:29:57.234
TALIESIN: All right, I'm in.

00:29:57.234 --> 00:30:00.605
MARISHA: Shove some other people around, do that
thing.

00:30:00.605 --> 00:30:03.130
MATT: For the hell of it, both of you guys roll
charisma checks, please.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.842
TALIESIN: Oh, this is going to be funny.

00:30:04.842 --> 00:30:07.407
MARISHA: Something we're great at. Just straight
checks?

00:30:07.407 --> 00:30:11.107
MATT: Just roll a d20 and add your charisma
modifier.

00:30:11.107 --> 00:30:13.859
TRAVIS: That dice just is the biggest tease.

00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:15.739
TALIESIN: Want to go at the same time?

00:30:15.739 --> 00:30:17.040
MARISHA: It rocks back and forth. Okay.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.126
TALIESIN: Three, two, one. Six.

00:30:19.126 --> 00:30:20.872
MARISHA: Eight.

00:30:20.872 --> 00:30:27.710
MATT: So the better part of 15 minutes pass of you
guys waiting there and being overlooked until

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:36.007
eventually the dwarf woman stops and goes, "All
right, sorry about that, didn't see you there.

00:30:36.007 --> 00:30:39.707
"You're a bit higher than the usual folk. What can
I do for you?"

00:30:39.707 --> 00:30:45.358
MARISHA: That seems oddly backwards. We need a
couple of rooms, a few rooms, a handful of rooms.

00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:47.796
And some drinks.

00:30:47.796 --> 00:30:49.951
MATT: "Both of those can be done, lassie."

00:30:49.951 --> 00:30:51.977
MARISHA: How many rooms do we need? Three, four?

00:30:51.977 --> 00:30:54.029
TALIESIN: (counting)

00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:56.403
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Four.

00:30:56.403 --> 00:31:05.354
MATT: "Four rooms, all right. Let's see then.
That's one gold piece per room per night."

00:31:05.354 --> 00:31:09.424
TALIESIN: I just put down four gold pieces.

00:31:09.424 --> 00:31:12.586
MARISHA: Does it come with amenities? Does it have
a mini bar? Do you charge?

00:31:12.586 --> 00:31:16.516
MATT: "This is the mini bar, my dear. But don't
worry. We can bring drinks up, we can bring

00:31:16.516 --> 00:31:20.273
"companions up, we can bring what you need up, just
let us know."

00:31:20.273 --> 00:31:22.818
TALIESIN: You're in a tourist town; things are
going to cost something.

00:31:22.818 --> 00:31:24.072
MARISHA: All right.

00:31:24.072 --> 00:31:28.067
LIAM: On the other side of the bar I cast Haste on
Jester while she is playing the piano.

00:31:28.067 --> 00:31:30.642
LAURA: I want to start playing The Entertainer.

00:31:30.642 --> 00:31:31.562
MATT: All right.

00:31:31.562 --> 00:31:35.241
SAM: (playing The Entertainer)

00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:36.725
MATT: But really fast.

00:31:36.725 --> 00:31:40.363
SAM and LAURA: (speedily playing The Entertainer)

00:31:40.363 --> 00:31:45.036
MATT: It's impressive. A little off-key, but
overall impressive, the speed of the composition.

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:51.989
Right as she starts crescendoing, about to get to
the quiet part (speedily playing The Entertainer),

00:31:51.989 --> 00:31:58.208
a hand slams down on the keys, and that same
half-elven gentlemen leans in once more and goes,

00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:04.890
"If I might please request my instrument returned
to me, my dear."

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:08.263
LAURA: This is a really good piano.

00:32:08.263 --> 00:32:09.401
MATT: "Thank you."

00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:11.634
LAURA: You should be really proud it's yours.

00:32:11.634 --> 00:32:13.343
MATT: "I am."

00:32:13.714 --> 00:32:15.617
LAURA: Do you have a tip jar?

00:32:15.617 --> 00:32:21.461
MATT: "I have a tipping hat." He pulls off from
the side this wide-brimmed hat that comes to a

00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:24.984
point in the front and floppy in the back, and he
sets it up on top of the piano.

00:32:24.984 --> 00:32:30.895
LAURA: I really think the first couple tips should
be to me because I really set up the room for you.

00:32:30.895 --> 00:32:35.142
MATT: "Well then, I certainly hope the first few
tips come while you're at the bench."

00:32:35.142 --> 00:32:36.723
LAURA: Fabulous.

00:32:36.723 --> 00:32:41.636
MATT: And he sits down at the bench and pushes you
off of it.

00:32:41.636 --> 00:32:47.021
LIAM: I toss one gold in and say: This one's for
the lady. Very good.

00:32:47.021 --> 00:32:49.021
LAURA: Did you see?

00:32:49.021 --> 00:32:54.114
MATT: "I saw." Cracks his knuckles, sets his music
down in front, starts getting ready. The other

00:32:54.114 --> 00:32:59.085
performers to the side are watching this out of
the corner of their eye and laughing. They're

00:32:59.085 --> 00:33:01.469
enjoying the tension that's brewing.

00:33:01.469 --> 00:33:05.487
LAURA: I run over and give Caleb a kiss on the
cheek. Thank you, Caleb.

00:33:05.487 --> 00:33:11.105
MATT: You guys get your rooms situated. As the
keys are being passed out to the different rooms,

00:33:11.105 --> 00:33:18.185
drinks are being handled. "So are you looking for
something strong or something strong?"

00:33:18.185 --> 00:33:22.723
TALIESIN: Amaze me, baffle me, make me forget
where I am.

00:33:22.723 --> 00:33:27.570
MATT: She leans into you and goes "I like you.
You're colorful."

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:31.554
TALIESIN: Bless you. You're colorful yourself. I
love everything you're wearing.

00:33:31.554 --> 00:33:34.958
MATT: "Thank you. First one's on me, how about
that?"

00:33:34.958 --> 00:33:39.275
TALIESIN: Bless you. I'll happily pay for hers as
well because I want to drink her under the fucking table.

00:33:39.275 --> 00:33:43.107
MATT: "Hold that till later on. That event's not
till later tonight."

00:33:43.107 --> 00:33:46.030
TALIESIN: What happens later tonight? Other than
more drink.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.067
MATT: "Is this your first time here?"

00:33:48.067 --> 00:33:49.576
TALIESIN: Are we that obvious?

00:33:49.576 --> 00:33:56.500
MATT: "A bit. Well, we have some performances
going on, and then we have our contest. Our weekly

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:03.798
"Hour of Honor. So just don't drink too much if
you're looking to compete." She pops the top

00:34:03.798 --> 00:34:08.920
button off the top of her blouse and gives a
better look at her dwarven cleavage.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.728
LAURA: I love that you did it.

00:34:11.728 --> 00:34:13.427
TALIESIN: Brava!

00:34:13.427 --> 00:34:21.243
MATT: I realized that I could do it as I was doing
it. As she does that, she reaches down and pulls

00:34:21.243 --> 00:34:32.872
out a dark red glass bottle with a large cap,
which she pulls off. This tiny glass, passes it

00:34:32.872 --> 00:34:39.016
over to you, and you look at it. You're used to
seeing liquid splash quite often, this sloshes at

00:34:39.016 --> 00:34:42.342
a slower pace. It's a thicker liquor.

00:34:42.342 --> 00:34:43.731
TALIESIN: I dip a finger.

00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:48.687
MATT: It's surprisingly sweet. Strong, the burn
kicks in afterward. You like it.

00:34:48.687 --> 00:34:50.981
TALIESIN: Shoot or sip?

00:34:50.981 --> 00:34:53.795
MATT: "That's up to you."

00:34:53.795 --> 00:34:58.515
MARISHA: Sorry to interrupt your incessant
flirting. Can I please have a damn drink?!

00:34:58.515 --> 00:34:59.775
MATT: "Would you like one of the same?"

00:34:59.775 --> 00:35:01.028
MARISHA: Yes, one of the same, yes!

00:35:01.028 --> 00:35:03.079
MATT: "All right, that'll be five silver pieces."

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:04.791
MARISHA: I thought he paid for me; I thought you
paid for me.

00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.407
TALIESIN: I am paying for you. I just put a gold
down. Keep the tip as well.

00:35:07.407 --> 00:35:12.070
MATT: "Oh my goodness, thank you!" She puts it in
her cleavage. Pours you another shot of it as

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.717
well, hands it over.

00:35:13.717 --> 00:35:15.137
MARISHA: I just kill the whole thing.

00:35:15.137 --> 00:35:19.623
MATT: All right, it burns, but it's good. It's
like a sweet thick honey liquor that coats the

00:35:19.623 --> 00:35:23.717
throat, and the coating at first feels nice until
the burn hits.

00:35:23.717 --> 00:35:25.185
MARISHA: It's kind of medicinal.

00:35:25.185 --> 00:35:27.724
TALIESIN: Challenge accepted. (satisfied grunt)

00:35:27.724 --> 00:35:31.019
MATT: It's good.

00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:35.998
TRAVIS: Caleb and I have come in at this point and
I turn to Caleb and go: I feel like I may be

00:35:35.998 --> 00:35:46.036
regretting my roommate choice tonight. It's just a
hunch. I think he's in his element.

00:35:46.036 --> 00:35:50.955
LIAM: Well, the odds are that you are not going to
even see him in your room tonight, so I wouldn't

00:35:50.955 --> 00:35:52.464
worry about it so much.

00:35:52.464 --> 00:35:58.134
TRAVIS: You think? He'll just like tear into the
night and maybe not come back until the sun comes up?

00:35:58.134 --> 00:36:02.994
LIAM: He's like a coyote. You know what that is?

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.444
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like--

00:36:04.444 --> 00:36:05.974
LIAM: (funny accent) Diplomatic Immunity.

00:36:05.974 --> 00:36:15.957
(laughter)

00:36:15.957 --> 00:36:18.244
SAM: (funny accent) I don't know what that means.

00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:20.485
(laughter)

00:36:20.485 --> 00:36:22.819
TALIESIN: Wow. Okay.

00:36:26.265 --> 00:36:28.867
TRAVIS: I do.

00:36:30.498 --> 00:36:33.340
LIAM: Yeah, they like to fuck a lot is my point.

00:36:33.695 --> 00:36:35.427
TRAVIS: I thought those were rabbits.

00:36:35.427 --> 00:36:37.390
MARISHA: I thought so, too.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.733
TRAVIS: We're going to have to work on our
analogies, I feel like there is something missing

00:36:39.733 --> 00:36:45.167
here. Yeah, okay, a bunny coyote.

00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:48.651
MARISHA: That sounds cute.

00:36:48.651 --> 00:36:50.018
TRAVIS: It does sound cute.

00:36:50.018 --> 00:36:55.427
LIAM: But if you want a quieter evening, you can
certainly share the room with Nott and I for once.

00:36:55.427 --> 00:36:58.994
It's probably not as raucous a room, but you're
welcome to it.

00:36:58.994 --> 00:37:06.285
TRAVIS: Yeah, just in case he goes full monty, I
might have like a secret knock or something.

00:37:06.285 --> 00:37:08.166
LAURA: Where did Yasha go?

00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:15.539
MATT: Yasha is with you, but the player's in
Japan, filming. As you glance around, Yasha's

00:37:15.539 --> 00:37:21.466
sitting towards the back, and towering over most
of the clientele here, and not necessarily

00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:28.149
uncomfortable, but unsure what to make of the
jovial atmosphere. There is the faint corner of a

00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:36.172
smile, but the awkward, anxious smile of not
knowing what to do and afraid to step any

00:37:36.172 --> 00:37:37.898
direction and crush somebody.

00:37:37.898 --> 00:37:39.033
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:37:39.033 --> 00:37:40.458
TALIESIN: She's turning on the charm.

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.703
TRAVIS: Fair enough, I appreciate that.

00:37:42.703 --> 00:37:44.282
LAURA: There are four rooms.

00:37:44.282 --> 00:37:47.402
MARISHA: I really like it when she crosses her
arms like that, it makes her biceps look good.

00:37:47.402 --> 00:37:53.225
LAURA: So Molly can have a room all to his own, if
he really wants to, you know (clicking) (whistle).

00:37:53.225 --> 00:37:55.498
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:37:55.498 --> 00:37:58.342
TALIESIN: Oh, are we talking about that, I'm not
going to invade your space if you don't need it,

00:37:58.342 --> 00:37:59.361
don't worry about it.

00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:03.172
TRAVIS: No, I mean half of me's interested, the
other half's terrified, so I'm just kind of curious.

00:38:03.172 --> 00:38:05.893
TALIESIN: And if you drink enough, you won't
remember either way.

00:38:05.893 --> 00:38:09.129
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:38:10.801 --> 00:38:16.085
MATT: At this point, Rissa's like, "Well, if
you've got your rooms taken care of, we're looking

00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:22.845
"for a place to sit, then." She glances past and
you can see patrons are starting to get really

00:38:22.845 --> 00:38:28.334
rowdy. They have these rope-hung chandeliers in
three different spots, and you can see one person

00:38:28.334 --> 00:38:34.702
is jumped up onto one and is hanging back and
forth off of it. Some people are like, "Yeah!" All

00:38:34.702 --> 00:38:41.280
of a sudden, the dwarf woman at the bar goes, "Oh,
for the love of--" clambers over with a speed you

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.271
didn't expect from her, rushes over and grabs the
ankle and tears him down, off onto the ground.

00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:50.087
"Not in my bar!"

00:38:50.565 --> 00:38:53.655
MARISHA: You know, I've never seen anyone
actually swing from a chandelier. I just thought

00:38:53.655 --> 00:38:55.418
it was a metaphor.

00:38:55.418 --> 00:38:59.290
TALIESIN: No, that's entirely something you can
do. It's more common than you'd think.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.721
LAURA: Is it allowed in other bars?

00:39:02.721 --> 00:39:10.648
MATT: Are you talking to Rissa? "I imagine if
they're not paying attention."

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:14.777
TALIESIN: There was some pub. I don't remember
what town I was in, but I do remember the pub

00:39:14.777 --> 00:39:18.611
because it was actually called the Swinging
Chandelier. I don't remember what town it was,

00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:22.943
though. But it was a great pub. It had the best
chandelier.

00:39:22.943 --> 00:39:27.499
MATT: "My gnomish eyes spot what looks to be one
open table across the way, right there." Rissa

00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:32.367
points, and you can see, past the way, there's one
table that two people are just getting up from and leaving.

00:39:32.367 --> 00:39:37.858
SAM: I will dart at full speed, full dash to get
that table.

00:39:39.806 --> 00:39:45.480
MATT: You and Rissa go into a full run. You
beating her easily. You get to the table and scoot

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:53.009
into the side. As she approaches, you watch as two
male gnomes intercept her, and block her path. One

00:39:53.009 --> 00:40:00.075
of them goes, "Uh-uh, sorry Tinkertop, table's not
for you." She goes, "Fuck off, Fitz! I've worked

00:40:00.075 --> 00:40:07.358
"hard enough. I saw this table fair and square."
The other one goes, "You don't work, Tabletop,

00:40:07.358 --> 00:40:17.546
"just like your brain-sick dad. This table's for
working folk." Fitz glances over and says, "Go ask

00:40:17.546 --> 00:40:23.172
"your pops to make you a table to drink at alone.
Might buy you an hour before it breaks."

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:29.617
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk right into the middle
of this. Gentle persons, are you harassing our

00:40:29.617 --> 00:40:31.637
employee right now?

00:40:32.172 --> 00:40:36.434
MATT: They both look wildly confused. "No, no."

00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:40.529
TALIESIN: We have employed the services of this
person right here, and I would agree that you

00:40:40.529 --> 00:40:46.531
should probably leave right now and get another
table for yourselves.

00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:48.134
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:40:52.915 --> 00:40:58.892
TALIESIN: Nope, that's a four.

00:40:58.892 --> 00:41:04.411
MATT: As you lean forward in that tense glare, a
little bit of a liquor-based burp comes up

00:41:04.411 --> 00:41:10.757
abruptly and breaks the intensity of the moment.
"Oh, someone's starting early, not too bad. No,

00:41:10.757 --> 00:41:13.734
"from what I've heard about these folks, their
blood's fire, but on the inside they're nothing

00:41:13.734 --> 00:41:19.266
but cold and clammy." He goes and flicks the edge
of your nose, these two little gnomish punks.

00:41:19.266 --> 00:41:21.223
TALIESIN: (demonic voice)

00:41:21.223 --> 00:41:22.205
LAURA: I use my tail to--

00:41:22.205 --> 00:41:26.073
TALIESIN: If you want to go, too, at the same
time. I say a little bit of Infernal, and I'm

00:41:26.073 --> 00:41:30.359
going to use a blood maledict and make him go
blind for a second.

00:41:30.662 --> 00:41:33.473
LAURA: I was going to smack him on the ass with my
tail at the same time.

00:41:33.473 --> 00:41:35.734
MATT: All right, which one?

00:41:35.734 --> 00:41:37.293
LAURA: I'll do the other one.

00:41:37.293 --> 00:41:38.690
TALIESIN: The one on the left for me.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.503
MATT: The one that just flicked you in the nose,
his eyes go black and you can see the bit of

00:41:41.503 --> 00:41:47.098
crimson pooling at the corner of the eyes. He
goes, (stuttering), stumbles back, and hits the

00:41:47.098 --> 00:41:50.217
stool, and falls onto his ass. "What's going
on?!"

00:41:50.217 --> 00:41:53.792
SAM: I'm going to jump on top of him and start
rifling through his pockets.

00:41:53.792 --> 00:41:57.212
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was hoping for it.

00:41:57.212 --> 00:41:59.662
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.

00:41:59.662 --> 00:42:01.415
TRAVIS: The table, Sam, the table!

00:42:01.415 --> 00:42:05.963
SAM: 23. No, 27.

00:42:06.433 --> 00:42:11.366
MATT: You manage to pull six silver pieces and
three gold pieces out of his pocket.

00:42:11.366 --> 00:42:13.558
SAM: Anything other than money?

00:42:13.558 --> 00:42:18.545
MATT: Right now, no. Strangely enough, it's only
money, and only that amount.

00:42:18.545 --> 00:42:22.480
LIAM: I'm watching Nott, and as soon as I see that
she has found everything that she is looking for,

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.568
I've got the copper wire ready, and I mutter
through it, to the one on the ground: They're

00:42:28.568 --> 00:42:31.619
going to kill you. You have to run, now.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.661
MATT: The one that gets slapped in the ass by
Jester is like, (stuttering) "I apologize. Rissa,

00:42:39.661 --> 00:42:46.545
"we didn't know," reaches over and goes and grabs
the friend. As soon as Nott jumps on and starts

00:42:46.545 --> 00:42:53.084
thrashing around on him, "Get that thing--" goes
and pushes you off of its body, picks up the other

00:42:53.084 --> 00:42:58.156
gnome. At this point, his eyes come back, and the
little strings of blood are curling down the side

00:42:58.156 --> 00:43:01.195
of his cheek. He goes, "What happened?"

00:43:01.633 --> 00:43:03.501
TALIESIN: Some people can't hold their liquor.
It's really embarrassing.

00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:04.955
LAURA: It's sad, really.

00:43:04.955 --> 00:43:06.287
MATT: They both just get lost into the crowd.

00:43:06.287 --> 00:43:09.092
LAURA: No, stay, play with us longer!

00:43:09.092 --> 00:43:14.439
MATT: Rissa looks over her shoulder at them leave
and (laughing).

00:43:14.439 --> 00:43:16.973
TRAVIS: Wow, that took a turn fast.

00:43:16.973 --> 00:43:19.051
TALIESIN: I like the way that worked out.

00:43:19.051 --> 00:43:20.461
MATT: "Me too, indeed!"

00:43:20.461 --> 00:43:23.300
SAM: Who were they?

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.827
MATT: "Fitz and Ashton. They're both a couple of
punks. I've known them since I was a kid."

00:43:26.827 --> 00:43:28.329
TRAVIS: They called you "Tabletop."

00:43:28.329 --> 00:43:29.616
MATT: "Well, Tinkertop."

00:43:29.616 --> 00:43:32.540
TRAVIS: Tinkertop.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.626
TALIESIN: Both equally mysterious.

00:43:34.626 --> 00:43:37.819
LAURA: Wait. So your dad is, what, rich or
something?

00:43:37.819 --> 00:43:41.165
MATT: "Eh--"

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.939
LAURA: It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's okay if
he is.

00:43:44.939 --> 00:43:51.992
MATT: She curls into the bench around the table
and leans one shoulder onto it. "My father's an

00:43:51.992 --> 00:44:04.440
inventor, a tinkerer of some renown at one time.
He's had a rough few years."

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.104
TRAVIS: He said he was brain-sick.

00:44:06.104 --> 00:44:08.539
MATT: "That's just him being an arsehole."

00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:10.247
LAURA: What kind of stuff does he make?

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:16.520
MATT: "All sorts of things, toys, contraptions,
occasionally whatever he's told to make by the

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:23.693
"Starosta, but he's just a bumbling twat, really."

00:44:23.693 --> 00:44:26.756
LAURA: Can we meet him?

00:44:26.756 --> 00:44:30.725
MATT: He's probably in nap time right now.
Tomorrow, maybe?

00:44:30.725 --> 00:44:33.189
LAURA: Okay!

00:44:33.189 --> 00:44:37.319
MARISHA: I bring over a round of drinks for
everybody.

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:44.721
MATT: Another round of just traditional ale drinks
for everybody would probably run you, we'll say

00:44:44.721 --> 00:44:58.074
three silver pieces. As you guys gather around for
a second, Rissa livens up a bit after that

00:44:58.074 --> 00:45:03.230
conversation. "But anyway, you've asked me a bit
about myself, what about you? What are you here

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:07.250
"for? What brings you to this godforsaken place?"

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.442
TRAVIS: We're actually here for a spot of work.

00:45:09.442 --> 00:45:12.585
MATT: "Looking for work?"

00:45:12.585 --> 00:45:15.219
LAURA: Yes, of course, work, that's what we're
doing.

00:45:15.219 --> 00:45:18.159
SAM: Not looking for work, we're just on a job.

00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:20.512
TRAVIS: I said for a spot of work.

00:45:20.512 --> 00:45:21.533
SAM: Yeah.

00:45:21.533 --> 00:45:22.670
LAURA: Oh, yes.

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:27.424
LIAM: Honestly, the name really sells this place.
We have been fascinated with it for quite some time.

00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:29.628
MATT: "That's not the first time we've heard
that."

00:45:29.628 --> 00:45:34.590
LAURA: I was really hoping you would have houses
of mushrooms. Do you have any?

00:45:35.781 --> 00:45:40.997
MATT: "I'm just going to call that unintentional
ignorance, but, no, gnomes don't live in

00:45:40.997 --> 00:45:47.097
"mushrooms. Don't be saying that around here very
loudly, not all folks will be taking kindly to that."

00:45:47.097 --> 00:45:49.103
LIAM: She's set in her ways.

00:45:49.103 --> 00:45:55.066
LAURA: No, I just thought Hupperdook sounded like
a mushroom sort of town.

00:45:55.066 --> 00:45:57.033
TRAVIS: Didn't she just say not to--

00:45:57.033 --> 00:46:00.176
LAURA: I'm going to stop, though.

00:46:00.718 --> 00:46:04.423
SAM: They prefer the term "toadstools."

00:46:04.423 --> 00:46:06.291
MARISHA: I somehow feel like that's worse.

00:46:06.291 --> 00:46:15.467
MATT: She grabs one of the tankards and starts
drinking heavily from it. "Anyway!" The music

00:46:15.467 --> 00:46:20.603
begins to kick in even louder. The celebration has
kicked into a second gear here, once I can find

00:46:20.603 --> 00:46:23.664
the music transition.

00:46:23.664 --> 00:46:29.213
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (heavy metal guitar melodies)

00:46:29.213 --> 00:46:34.979
TALIESIN: Oh, so it's the Noise Room. (heavy bass
thudding)

00:46:34.979 --> 00:46:42.634
MATT: The crowd begins to hush for a moment. From
one of the back rooms, a door opens and a range of

00:46:42.634 --> 00:46:47.876
brightly-colored gnome dancers come rushing into
the room to a swell of cheers and applause. You

00:46:47.876 --> 00:46:53.076
see four dancers emerge, across the spectrum of
gender, and take to tabletops and begin to stomp

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:58.098
and click their feet to the rhythm of the music.
The musicians begin to finally pick up and build.

00:46:58.098 --> 00:47:04.032
The pianist you met earlier is starting to make
his music happen. It's beautiful and echoes

00:47:04.032 --> 00:47:08.839
through the room, the placement of it. You get the
sense now, whether it be some enchantment or some

00:47:08.839 --> 00:47:14.635
intentional acoustic presence in the room, but the
music carries well and seems to bleed from

00:47:14.635 --> 00:47:20.651
everywhere. As the dancers are up on the tables,
these silk scarves rainbow-colored, from their

00:47:20.651 --> 00:47:27.904
arms, twirl into large circles and shapes, and
they have this worked out, fantastic choreography

00:47:27.904 --> 00:47:32.584
in unison. They begin to leap from tabletop to
tabletop in a circular fashion, making these large

00:47:32.584 --> 00:47:38.467
arching foot leaps and landing again. Folks cheer
with each land, the music whirring itself into a

00:47:38.467 --> 00:47:42.781
frenzy. Folks are starting to toss coins towards
them on the table. They, in the middle of it, will

00:47:42.781 --> 00:47:47.493
spin, catch one and pocket it and move back into
the dance. You get the sense this a very practiced

00:47:47.617 --> 00:47:53.224
and fairly often performed as to how well-oiled
this machine of a performance is.

00:47:53.224 --> 00:47:55.046
LIAM: They are almost as nimble as you.

00:47:55.046 --> 00:47:56.905
MARISHA: What?

00:47:56.905 --> 00:47:58.477
LAURA: I toss a silver.

00:47:58.477 --> 00:48:00.635
MATT: Snatched out of the air.

00:48:00.635 --> 00:48:02.904
TALIESIN: I toss two at the same time.

00:48:02.904 --> 00:48:10.681
MARISHA: I see if I catch one. Missile Snare. I'm
going to try to catch one of Molly's coins.

00:48:10.681 --> 00:48:11.869
TRAVIS: Did you just take a dancer's tip?

00:48:11.869 --> 00:48:18.667
MATT: Make a dexterity check. This is going to be
a contested dexterity check between you and a dancer.

00:48:18.667 --> 00:48:23.517
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm into it. Especially if it
fails, please!

00:48:23.517 --> 00:48:24.927
MARISHA: Natural one.

00:48:24.927 --> 00:48:26.360
TALIESIN: Yeah!

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.525
TRAVIS: That's justice.

00:48:27.525 --> 00:48:28.576
MARISHA: It is.

00:48:28.576 --> 00:48:34.167
MATT: As you reach for the coin, your fingers
almost touch it before everything goes dark as a

00:48:34.167 --> 00:48:42.369
wooden shoe-covered foot (slamming) across your
face from the dancer who catches it between two

00:48:42.369 --> 00:48:47.176
fingers, looks down, retracts the foot, and as you
get your vision back and look up, the dancer gives

00:48:47.176 --> 00:48:51.305
you a wink and goes back into a spin.

00:48:51.305 --> 00:48:59.400
MARISHA: I wink back. You know, I kind of liked
that. It was kind of hot.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.741
MATT: As the dancers begin to gather, leaping from
table to table, they start getting closer to the

00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:09.391
center of the room. They begin to spin together
until eventually they clasp hands. Some of the bar

00:49:09.391 --> 00:49:13.826
hands grab the tables and start pushing them
together in the center, telling the patrons to

00:49:13.826 --> 00:49:18.844
step back a bit. As they do, the circle continues
to get tighter as they leap from table to table,

00:49:18.844 --> 00:49:24.329
holding each other wrist to wrist, arm to arm. As
they do, the silks are billowing out and you can

00:49:24.329 --> 00:49:28.144
see them extending. The silks they've been holding
seem to have been a bunch hidden within their

00:49:28.144 --> 00:49:33.915
sleeves. As they billow out, they widen until
it's like a parachute of rainbow colors that just

00:49:33.915 --> 00:49:39.242
spin in this circle. It completely engulfs them;
all you see is the tip of their heads within this

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:43.651
swirl of color until eventually the music comes to
a climax and with a heavy stomp, all the colors

00:49:43.651 --> 00:49:48.195
fade, and the dancers bow. Everyone in the room
starts cheering and clapping.

00:49:48.195 --> 00:49:50.249
(applause)

00:49:50.249 --> 00:49:51.521
TRAVIS: Hot damn!

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:56.512
MATT: The dancers smile and step off, walking
around with hats in the front, taking tips from

00:49:56.512 --> 00:50:00.540
people at tables as they adjust the tables back to
their original point. Everyone else goes back to

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:05.850
their meals, and you see them tossing the odd
copper or silver piece into their hats.

00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:07.552
SAM: I don't know if we can learn that dance.

00:50:07.552 --> 00:50:09.638
LAURA: I think we can do it.

00:50:09.638 --> 00:50:14.995
SAM: Let's just work on something simple. We're
going to take a moment to work out a couple of

00:50:14.995 --> 00:50:21.032
moves in case it comes up. Just some basic hand
moves.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.064
MATT: Kiri is off to the side. (chirping)

00:50:28.064 --> 00:50:31.153
LAURA: We can have her stand on one shoulder
each--

00:50:31.153 --> 00:50:32.915
SAM: I'm much shorter than you.

00:50:32.915 --> 00:50:42.146
LAURA: I'll be on my knees. Then we can do these
things. Kiri can have a ribbon, and she'll do this

00:50:42.146 --> 00:50:43.304
while we do it.

00:50:43.304 --> 00:50:44.348
SAM: I like it.

00:50:44.348 --> 00:50:46.484
LAURA: It's basically the same as what they just
did.

00:50:46.484 --> 00:50:50.855
SAM: Caleb maybe can do some special effects.

00:50:50.855 --> 00:50:58.291
LIAM: Will it be dark where we are doing this? I
worry about-- you know what I worry about.

00:50:58.291 --> 00:50:59.849
SAM: Maybe I should sit it out.

00:50:59.849 --> 00:51:06.838
LIAM: No, it just depends on the situation. This
happens all over the city, outside, everywhere, ja?

00:51:06.838 --> 00:51:10.522
MATT: "For the most part, yeah. As the evening
goes on it tends to gather around the places where

00:51:10.522 --> 00:51:15.261
"drink is running freely, until everyone passes
out, then wakes up, hair of the dog, usually takes

00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:17.481
"himself a bit of Fuse and then gets back to
work."

00:51:17.481 --> 00:51:19.532
TRAVIS: A bit of Fuse?

00:51:19.532 --> 00:51:25.493
MATT: "A Fuse is the hair of the dog drink that we
brew here to get everyone waking up and back to work."

00:51:25.493 --> 00:51:30.080
TRAVIS: I know what Molly'll be having in a couple
hours.

00:51:30.503 --> 00:51:35.225
MATT: "I don't know how it's going to mingle well
with non-gnomish tracts, but I'm willing to watch and try."

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:36.726
TALIESIN: I'm very excited to find out.

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:38.707
MATT: "Me too." (laughs)

00:51:38.707 --> 00:51:42.127
TRAVIS: Rissa, can I ask you about the-- what's it
called-- honor hour that comes up later?

00:51:42.127 --> 00:51:43.574
MATT: "Hour of Honor?"

00:51:43.574 --> 00:51:45.718
TRAVIS: Hour of Honor, yeah. What's that about?

00:51:45.718 --> 00:51:51.959
MATT: "Look over there." She points to the far
wall, and they're starting to set up lights on it,

00:51:51.959 --> 00:52:03.387
these glowing lanterns they have on pikes. It's a
collection of wooden name plates. She goes, "Once

00:52:03.387 --> 00:52:11.184
"a week, there's a contest where the previous
holders of the Hour of Honor can take challenges.

00:52:11.184 --> 00:52:16.538
"Whoever provides the most monetary amount to the
challenge gets to go one-on-one with their team,

00:52:16.541 --> 00:52:21.104
"drink to drink, until only one's left un-puking or
un-passed out."

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:23.274
SAM: A team drinking competition?

00:52:23.281 --> 00:52:29.237
MATT: "The remainder gets the coin, I think a
percentage goes to the house and gets to take the

00:52:29.537 --> 00:52:34.197
"title and a token. That token is worth a free
drink to each member of that team in this bar

00:52:34.197 --> 00:52:35.519
"every night."

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:36.569
LAURA: Every night?

00:52:36.569 --> 00:52:43.272
LIAM: It is almost like a drunken CrossFit gym.
I'm sorry. It is almost like a CrossFit gym.

00:52:43.272 --> 00:52:45.123
TRAVIS: There you go.

00:52:45.123 --> 00:52:48.965
LAURA: We should probably do that. For this, I
would make an exception.

00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:51.922
TRAVIS: It could cost a lot of money.

00:52:51.922 --> 00:52:53.320
LAURA: How much?

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:58.364
TRAVIS: Well, he said whoever contributes the most
monetarily gets to take a shot at the honor.

00:52:58.364 --> 00:53:00.378
LAURA: How much do people usually contribute?

00:53:00.378 --> 00:53:02.185
LIAM: I have two gold.

00:53:02.185 --> 00:53:07.660
MATT: "From what I've seen, it can depend on if
people are that interested or that competitive.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:13.133
"Some folks put up the few gold they've earned for
a few days if they're feeling lucky. I've seen

00:53:13.133 --> 00:53:19.522
"people put upwards of 20, 25 gold sometimes, which
is quite a sizable sum."

00:53:19.522 --> 00:53:23.537
LAURA: Are you a big drinker, Rissa?

00:53:23.537 --> 00:53:27.636
MATT: "I can hold my weight, but I'm not much of a
competitor, if that's what you're asking."

00:53:27.636 --> 00:53:34.627
TRAVIS: Is it happening relatively soon, or do we
have a few more hours to explore a bit? I just

00:53:34.627 --> 00:53:40.139
have the feeling if we were to engage, that all
activities after that would not be documented in

00:53:40.139 --> 00:53:42.299
the ol' brain so well.

00:53:42.299 --> 00:53:49.205
MATT: You've probably been here for the better
part of an hour or two, just getting your paces,

00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:53.749
having drinks and taking in the performances and
the music. "I'd say you probably have another hour

00:53:53.749 --> 00:53:55.261
"before it begins."

00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:56.567
TALIESIN: Want to do a little runaround?

00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:58.236
TRAVIS: I figure, if we're going to do that.

00:53:58.236 --> 00:53:59.699
TALIESIN: I think we're going to do that.

00:53:59.699 --> 00:54:00.817
TRAVIS: All right.

00:54:00.817 --> 00:54:05.341
MARISHA: Let's go. Who's going to put Kiri either
on their shoulders, or we need to--

00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:07.645
TRAVIS: To bed!

00:54:07.645 --> 00:54:09.263
LAURA: We can't put her to bed!

00:54:09.263 --> 00:54:10.320
TRAVIS: Why not?

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.267
LAURA: Because she'll just come out of the room.
Won't you, Kiri?

00:54:13.267 --> 00:54:14.636
SAM: Why would she come out of the room?

00:54:14.636 --> 00:54:15.626
TALIESIN: Because Hupperdook.

00:54:15.626 --> 00:54:17.489
LAURA: Because there's so much noise and stuff.

00:54:17.489 --> 00:54:18.950
TALIESIN: It's family friendly.

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:25.318
TRAVIS: There's no drop-off daycare. Is there a
daycare here, Rissa?

00:54:25.318 --> 00:54:26.516
MATT: (like Jester) "I am Kiri."

00:54:26.762 --> 00:54:28.564
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

00:54:28.564 --> 00:54:30.755
LAURA: Yes, you are very sweet.

00:54:30.755 --> 00:54:33.404
MATT: (like Jester) "Yes, I am very sweet."

00:54:33.404 --> 00:54:37.242
LIAM: Perhaps our feathered friend is a little
more important than the horses and I could leave

00:54:37.242 --> 00:54:41.275
my threads around her room and she would be safe
there. I would know if there was a problem.

00:54:41.275 --> 00:54:43.442
MATT: (like Caleb) "Doesn't matter, though."

00:54:43.544 --> 00:54:48.680
LIAM: No, but it does matter, because you are a
young child and you need to get your rest, and we

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.693
are going to be doing things that are, quite
frankly, not for your eyes.

00:54:51.693 --> 00:54:53.352
MATT: (like Jester) "Okay."

00:54:53.352 --> 00:54:56.227
LAURA: She would come out of the room. I know her.

00:54:56.907 --> 00:54:59.440
MATT: (like Jester) "I know her."

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.988
MARISHA: What if we get her one of those child
leashes?

00:55:01.988 --> 00:55:07.330
SAM: Ooh! They said that they would send someone
to the room, right, Molly?

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:08.757
TALIESIN: Did they?

00:55:08.757 --> 00:55:14.511
SAM: Didn't you say that they would send someone
to the room?

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:15.770
LIAM: We could get a babysitter.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:21.203
SAM: Like a babysitter. You could pay one of their
women to watch our little Kiri.

00:55:21.203 --> 00:55:26.891
TALIESIN: I have done some ridiculous things in my
life; that might take the top of it, though.

00:55:26.891 --> 00:55:30.410
SAM: They're working women; we rent them for a
time.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:33.611
MATT: Rissa, at this point, goes, "Well,
first off, you're assuming they're all women."

00:55:33.611 --> 00:55:40.926
SAM: Oh yeah, that's true! We could get a sturdy,
strapping gigolo man to go up there and

00:55:40.926 --> 00:55:43.186
watch out for Kiri!

00:55:43.186 --> 00:55:47.606
LAURA: I don't think that's a bad idea.

00:55:47.606 --> 00:55:52.833
TRAVIS: Rissa, do you know how much one of these
evening companions might run per hour?

00:55:52.833 --> 00:55:55.380
MATT: "I can honestly say I do not. Sorry."

00:55:56.017 --> 00:55:58.262
TRAVIS: Should I go ask?

00:55:58.262 --> 00:55:59.356
SAM: Yes.

00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:03.919
TRAVIS: Yes, all right, fine. I'll be right back.
I'll make my way up to the bar, to the one with the--

00:56:03.919 --> 00:56:12.778
TALIESIN: I've got an idea. I've got an idea.
There is one member of our party who is probably

00:56:12.778 --> 00:56:17.451
not going to want to go out and see this
ridiculousness.

00:56:17.451 --> 00:56:19.755
SAM: She is a wallflower tonight.

00:56:19.755 --> 00:56:22.323
MARISHA: She does seem very uncomfortable, yeah.

00:56:22.323 --> 00:56:25.282
TRAVIS: I still want to check the price, so I go
up to the bar.

00:56:27.195 --> 00:56:32.010
MATT: As you approach the bar, the dwarven woman,
who's in the process of cleaning a spill on the

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:38.243
side, looks over and sees you and does a
triple-take, like-- "Well, would you look at this

00:56:38.243 --> 00:56:42.352
"strapping mass of green and tooth." (laughter)

00:56:42.352 --> 00:56:43.632
TRAVIS: Thank you kindly, ma'am.

00:56:43.632 --> 00:56:45.370
MATT: "What can I do for you?"

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:50.018
TRAVIS: It's a little early in the evening, but I
thought I might get a head start and inquire what

00:56:50.018 --> 00:56:54.248
some friendship might run me.

00:56:54.248 --> 00:57:04.982
MATT: "Mighty forward, but I can't say I'm not
interested. I've got a few more hours on my shift,

00:57:04.982 --> 00:57:07.552
"but if you hang around--"

00:57:07.552 --> 00:57:12.680
TRAVIS: I would hate to remove you from your
duties. Plus, my companions are also interested in

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.517
the same. You said there might be--

00:57:15.517 --> 00:57:18.748
MATT: "Well, it's been a while since I've--"

00:57:18.748 --> 00:57:28.461
TRAVIS: Oh! No, yeah, let me clarify. (stammering)
I need--

00:57:30.025 --> 00:57:32.095
MATT: She goes and starts pouring herself a
drink.

00:57:32.095 --> 00:57:38.830
TRAVIS: Multiples-- not multiples! I need
individual companions for my friends, not just

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:41.538
your beautiful self.

00:57:41.538 --> 00:57:45.275
MATT: "How many?"

00:57:45.275 --> 00:57:47.499
TRAVIS: Three.

00:57:47.499 --> 00:57:52.799
MATT: "Three companions? All right. I have to go
and connect with a friend here and see what's

00:57:52.799 --> 00:57:55.065
"available, but that's certainly doable."

00:57:55.065 --> 00:57:58.295
TRAVIS: Great, and do you know how much that might
run?

00:57:58.295 --> 00:58:00.954
MATT: "Well, that depends on what you're asking
for. Is it only for the hour, is it for the

00:58:00.954 --> 00:58:02.638
"evening, what the requests are--"

00:58:02.638 --> 00:58:05.518
TRAVIS: Per hour is good, yeah.

00:58:05.518 --> 00:58:12.361
MATT: "For an hour? Three? That'd put you about,
say, 20 gold."

00:58:12.361 --> 00:58:19.639
TRAVIS: Boy, that sounds like a fun night.
Outstanding. I will be sure to return. I turn my

00:58:19.639 --> 00:58:22.053
head and leave.

00:58:22.053 --> 00:58:23.543
LAURA: What did she say?

00:58:23.543 --> 00:58:28.640
TRAVIS: That was the most horrible thing I've ever
had to do. I'm not prepared to talk to people

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.329
about those things.

00:58:30.329 --> 00:58:31.191
LAURA: What did she say?

00:58:31.191 --> 00:58:34.132
TRAVIS: It's 20 gold for three people for an
hour.

00:58:34.132 --> 00:58:35.374
LAURA: That's it?

00:58:35.374 --> 00:58:37.192
SAM: Three man-hours?

00:58:37.192 --> 00:58:42.302
TRAVIS: Nope. At one hour, three people: 20 gold.
So that's-- yeah.

00:58:42.302 --> 00:58:43.843
LIAM: Are you all right?

00:58:43.843 --> 00:58:45.550
TRAVIS: God, it's real uncomfortable.

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:48.222
LAURA: Why do we need three people to watch Kiri?

00:58:48.222 --> 00:58:54.030
TRAVIS: Look, I was just making shit up on the
fly, all right?

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:57.263
TALIESIN: Yasha, I know you're not into this. I
know that you want to have a night out. Do you

00:58:57.263 --> 00:59:00.377
just want to sit and keep the young one out of
trouble?

00:59:00.377 --> 00:59:07.517
MATT: "I can do that, yeah. She's small. I can
hold her down."

00:59:08.923 --> 00:59:11.539
TALIESIN: It's going to be fine. That's a joke.

00:59:11.539 --> 00:59:18.344
LIAM: Are you sure? I was planning to go out, but
it's awkward for me. I thought you would be going.

00:59:18.344 --> 00:59:19.742
MATT: "It's awkward for me, too."

00:59:19.742 --> 00:59:25.090
LIAM: I thought that we could give each other
moral support, you know what I mean?

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:32.172
MATT: "Good, then you go out and have a good time.
I'll hold the bird down."

00:59:32.172 --> 00:59:36.305
TRAVIS: Is that a phrase, or does she actually
mean she'll hold the bird down?

00:59:36.305 --> 00:59:37.906
TALIESIN: Only one way to find out.

00:59:37.906 --> 00:59:39.879
LIAM: I think the child will be dead by the
morning.

00:59:41.952 --> 00:59:48.496
LAURA: Kiri, are you cool with staying with Yasha
for the whole night?

00:59:48.496 --> 00:59:52.173
MATT: (like Jester) "I can send a message."

00:59:52.173 --> 00:59:59.147
LAURA: Do you promise you won't try to leave her,
and you won't try to come out and find us?

00:59:59.147 --> 01:00:05.931
MATT: (like Jester) "Okay. I don't know if it's
smart."

01:00:07.223 --> 01:00:09.595
LAURA: I don't think it is either, Kiri!

01:00:09.595 --> 01:00:13.436
TRAVIS: Jester, come on. She is just trying to tug
on your heart strings. She'll be fine.

01:00:13.436 --> 01:00:14.828
MATT: (chirping)

01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:17.357
LAURA: Oh, I just love her so much.

01:00:17.357 --> 01:00:19.193
TRAVIS: I know. She'll be safe.

01:00:19.193 --> 01:00:20.574
LAURA: You be good.

01:00:20.574 --> 01:00:23.365
MATT: She holds her little dagger in front of
her.

01:00:23.365 --> 01:00:25.740
TALIESIN: I'll bring you back something, Yash.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.273
MARISHA: Blade pointed down, Kiri. Good job.

01:00:28.273 --> 01:00:29.656
MATT: (like Jester) "Okay."

01:00:29.656 --> 01:00:31.160
MARISHA: There we go.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.779
SAM: Caleb, we may need a third person to join our
dance now.

01:00:35.779 --> 01:00:44.561
LAURA: Oh, that's right. Now me and Caleb will do
it. You stand on our shoulders. You wave the ribbon.

01:00:44.561 --> 01:00:50.250
LIAM: No, that is not a thing that is happening.
You could ask Beauregard. That's not going to happen.

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:52.362
SAM: You can't dance? You're not a dancer?

01:00:52.362 --> 01:00:53.610
LAURA: Have you ever danced, Caleb?

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:54.338
LIAM: Ja.

01:00:54.338 --> 01:00:56.365
LAURA: (gasps) You have? I can't picture you
dancing.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.398
TALIESIN: He's never going to dance again.

01:00:59.398 --> 01:01:01.662
TRAVIS: (singing) He's never going to dance
again.

01:01:01.662 --> 01:01:03.893
MARISHA: There's too many dance puns!

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:07.180
TALIESIN: You can dance if you want to.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.315
MATT: He's not going to leave his friends behind.

01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:13.276
LIAM: Yeah, that is the key: if I want to. No,
perhaps Beauregard is fleet of foot. She could

01:01:13.276 --> 01:01:15.374
round you out.

01:01:15.374 --> 01:01:16.717
SAM: Are you sure?

01:01:16.717 --> 01:01:19.456
LAURA: But Caleb, we want to dance with you.

01:01:19.456 --> 01:01:23.008
TRAVIS: Fucking Pet Sematary up in this bitch.

01:01:23.008 --> 01:01:31.657
LIAM: I played with Mommy, and I played with Judd,
and now I going to play with you. I will take a

01:01:31.657 --> 01:01:34.761
rain check on that. No thank you, Jester. It is
tempting, but no.

01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:37.033
LAURA: We'll figure it out.

01:01:37.033 --> 01:01:39.502
SAM: I guess we can-- Beau?

01:01:39.502 --> 01:01:43.666
MARISHA: Yeah? No, I know, I'm your second
choice--

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:53.695
SAM: No, third. It was Kiri first, Caleb second.
You're three.

01:01:53.695 --> 01:02:01.483
LAURA: You're very dexterous and I think you'll be
a very good dancer.

01:02:01.483 --> 01:02:04.086
MARISHA: Feels like you had to reach for that. You
stammered a little.

01:02:04.086 --> 01:02:08.536
LAURA: Plus, you have already lots of scarves on
you, so you can do a lot of the things

01:02:08.536 --> 01:02:10.162
the people were doing.

01:02:10.162 --> 01:02:11.350
TRAVIS: You got scarves on you?

01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:12.244
MARISHA: I do have a lot of scarves.

01:02:12.244 --> 01:02:15.440
LIAM: No, that's truthful. It's obvious how
dexterous you are; you're just gruff.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:23.245
LAURA: Yeah! So should we dance in the street?

01:02:23.245 --> 01:02:27.126
SAM: We should rehearse. We don't know when we're
going to need the dance yet.

01:02:27.126 --> 01:02:30.771
TALIESIN: We're going outside to see what this
place has to offer before it's time for a drinking

01:02:30.771 --> 01:02:32.010
contest that we'll--

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:34.945
TRAVIS: We're going to need a beagle to lead the
charge. I'm assuming that's you?

01:02:34.945 --> 01:02:36.617
TALIESIN: (shouting) Onward and outward!

01:02:36.617 --> 01:02:45.558
TRAVIS: Jesus. (dog baying)

01:02:46.098 --> 01:02:53.634
MATT: As you're making your way out, the dwarven
lass reaches out in your direction, Fjord, to flag you down.

01:02:53.634 --> 01:02:56.956
TRAVIS: Oh! Ma'am.

01:02:56.956 --> 01:03:05.733
MATT: "So, just asking: how soon are you wanting
this companionship sent to your rooms, and--" and

01:03:06.232 --> 01:03:11.736
her finger's playing with the front of your armor
on the edge of the bar, and goes, "I could give

01:03:11.736 --> 01:03:14.474
"you a discount."

01:03:14.474 --> 01:03:17.887
TRAVIS: (stammering)

01:03:17.887 --> 01:03:22.355
LAURA: You know, here's the thing. He's already
been with the Ruby of the Sea, so probably nothing

01:03:22.355 --> 01:03:29.763
you do could compare to that. Kind of sad,
really.

01:03:29.763 --> 01:03:32.721
MATT: "Would you like me to cancel your request,
then?"

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:42.989
TRAVIS: No, no. I'd like to put a deposit down. I
don't know when we'll be back. Maybe four gold to

01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:46.634
hold the reservation?

01:03:46.634 --> 01:03:48.297
LIAM: Ask if there's a cancellation fee.

01:03:48.297 --> 01:03:50.725
TRAVIS: No, I can't. I'm terrified.

01:03:51.066 --> 01:03:59.115
MATT: "All right, I'll hold on to this until then.
Well, hopefully see you around." Gives a hint of

01:03:59.115 --> 01:04:04.814
grinning stink-eye in your direction, Jester, and
back to Fjord: "Take care of yourself, lad."

01:04:04.814 --> 01:04:06.381
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

01:04:06.381 --> 01:04:08.097
MARISHA: Did you just put a hooker on layaway?

01:04:08.097 --> 01:04:12.092
TRAVIS: I think I did. I feel like I did. Did you
just say I'd been with your mom?!

01:04:12.092 --> 01:04:15.125
LAURA: I know. As soon as I said it, it was really
creepy.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:16.799
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fucked up!

01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:20.996
LAURA: But you know what? It was just a power
play, and it didn't really work out.

01:04:20.996 --> 01:04:26.378
MARISHA: I will say, normally being like, "You
slept with my mom" is an insult or something, or

01:04:26.378 --> 01:04:27.911
"Don't talk about my mom."

01:04:27.911 --> 01:04:33.632
LAURA: Yeah, but people that have slept with my
mom are really rich and really powerful, usually,

01:04:33.632 --> 01:04:36.339
so it's a compliment for them.

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:40.094
LIAM: Also, you have to embrace "yes, and," Fjord.
"Yes, and," not "no, but."

01:04:40.094 --> 01:04:47.515
SAM: This is good. You have an opportunity for
later, if you choose to use it.

01:04:47.515 --> 01:04:53.277
LAURA: Yeah, I could sit in the room and let you
know if they're any good or not!

01:04:54.342 --> 01:04:57.995
LIAM: Are you honestly okay? You seem very
perturbed.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:01.241
TRAVIS: I'm not real comfortable with this sort of
stuff.

01:05:01.241 --> 01:05:03.086
SAM: Have you ever been with someone?

01:05:03.086 --> 01:05:04.178
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally.

01:05:04.178 --> 01:05:05.532
SAM: Are you sure?

01:05:05.532 --> 01:05:06.170
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.976
SAM: Insight check.

01:05:06.976 --> 01:05:07.988
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:12.169
(laughter)

01:05:12.169 --> 01:05:13.863
LAURA: Oh, that's pretty good.

01:05:13.863 --> 01:05:15.069
SAM: 20.

01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:17.487
TRAVIS: I have.

01:05:17.487 --> 01:05:19.718
SAM: Okay. He seems to be telling the truth.

01:05:19.718 --> 01:05:22.126
TRAVIS: Maybe not many, though.

01:05:24.082 --> 01:05:26.159
LAURA: Have you ever paid for anybody before?

01:05:26.159 --> 01:05:27.701
TRAVIS: No.

01:05:27.701 --> 01:05:29.538
TALIESIN: Like Captain America, not many?

01:05:29.538 --> 01:05:32.532
TRAVIS: Yep. Pretty close.

01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:35.158
TALIESIN: Frozen in ice, man. It'll happen.

01:05:35.158 --> 01:05:39.951
LIAM: Was it someone special?

01:05:39.951 --> 01:05:41.935
TRAVIS: No.

01:05:43.376 --> 01:05:47.345
MATT: At this point, Kiri, who's not that far from
you because you're still in the bar, says (like

01:05:47.345 --> 01:05:57.434
Jester) "Don't eat humans, okay?" Yasha goes, "I'm
going to take her upstairs," and heads off to the chamber.

01:05:57.434 --> 01:06:04.966
TRAVIS: I'm going to let you guys take the lead on
this. I'm more of a spectator, at this point.

01:06:04.966 --> 01:06:08.589
SAM: With the hooker?

01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:12.293
TRAVIS: No, I thought we were going out for an
hour!

01:06:12.293 --> 01:06:15.420
MARISHA: Sorry, you jumped conversations. You have
to specify.

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.743
TRAVIS: Thought we were going to warm up into this
thing!

01:06:17.743 --> 01:06:19.611
SAM: With the hooker?

01:06:19.611 --> 01:06:22.120
TRAVIS: No, we're going out for a bit, right?

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.758
LAURA: Why did you give them money, though?

01:06:23.758 --> 01:06:26.855
MATT: There's a big, bassy (impact) that you can
feel in your chest. There's a flash of color

01:06:26.855 --> 01:06:32.048
outside, and there, out maybe 20 feet, looking up,
Molly. There's a flash of the firework in the sky

01:06:32.048 --> 01:06:34.189
going across his horns and form.

01:06:34.189 --> 01:06:36.124
TALIESIN: (maniacal laughter)

01:06:36.124 --> 01:06:37.781
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus. It begins.

01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:39.893
SAM: Okay, let's go make the rounds.

01:06:40.441 --> 01:06:45.348
MATT: You walk out in this fair. Most people who
have gathered here, they're sitting there, they're

01:06:45.348 --> 01:06:51.208
eating food, and they're watching the fireworks as
they go off. There's a few folks out there, candle

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:55.961
dancers, they have these light candles, and it's
this very slow, meticulous dance. They're moving

01:06:55.961 --> 01:07:01.893
in the darkest places of the corner and give this
almost will-o'-wisp-type performance. It's really

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:06.763
enchanting, and borderline creepy at times, when
you can't actually make out the forms of the

01:07:06.763 --> 01:07:13.005
dancer in the shadow. People are watching and
keeping an intent look on it. Otherwise, the rest

01:07:13.005 --> 01:07:17.562
of this thoroughfare is apparently here, though
you're not sure how much businesses are open,

01:07:17.562 --> 01:07:21.582
since most people are in the process of recovering
from a day of business. What do you want to do?

01:07:21.582 --> 01:07:27.230
LIAM: Predictably, I would like, as I follow this
group around, to keep one eye open for a bookstore.

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:31.600
SAM: The nerdiest raver.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.622
TRAVIS: Can we get you a card, and hold it up?
Bookstore.

01:07:36.622 --> 01:07:41.321
TALIESIN: It needs dónde está la biblioteca?

01:07:44.635 --> 01:07:46.981
MATT: What else are you guys going to do?

01:07:46.981 --> 01:07:51.778
TALIESIN: I'm looking for vendors. I'm looking for
things that are amusing. Bright lights, colors.

01:07:51.778 --> 01:07:55.026
SAM: If there's any more of those sparklers or
poppers around--

01:07:55.026 --> 01:08:00.097
MATT: Oh, yeah. There aren't a lot of them,
meaning there's not an endless supply, but you go

01:08:00.097 --> 01:08:04.517
back to the same people that are just up the road
to the right from the outside of the tavern. You

01:08:04.517 --> 01:08:07.925
can find the same two vendors you spoke with
earlier.

01:08:07.925 --> 01:08:10.008
MARISHA: You want to buy them out real fast? Let's
go!

01:08:10.008 --> 01:08:11.202
SAM: Steal some?

01:08:11.202 --> 01:08:12.805
MARISHA: We can just pay for it.

01:08:12.805 --> 01:08:16.289
TALIESIN: You said there were silk flowers?
There's fake flowers? I want to see if I can find

01:08:16.289 --> 01:08:22.333
the best looking-- that New Orleans, Halloween
night, crazy beautiful, overproduced--

01:08:22.333 --> 01:08:26.802
MATT: Make an investigation check, and you make a
perception check, Caleb.

01:08:28.827 --> 01:08:33.527
TALIESIN: (blows a raspberry) Goddamn it! No.

01:08:33.527 --> 01:08:38.050
SAM: That is not the Snitch. Just because it's
gold, doesn't mean it's a Snitch.

01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:39.076
MATT: Was it a natural one?

01:08:39.076 --> 01:08:40.895
TALIESIN: That was a two.

01:08:40.895 --> 01:08:44.805
MATT: Oh, so not quite a natural one. You come
upon a number of vendors that have already given

01:08:44.805 --> 01:08:49.486
out all their flowers, so you're having a hard
time finding anybody that still have any for sale

01:08:49.486 --> 01:08:52.612
in this main central area.

01:08:52.612 --> 01:08:55.092
TALIESIN: If anybody sees, I'm looking for silk
flowers. Really, something nice. Something super

01:08:55.092 --> 01:08:56.410
fancy, if you see anything.

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:58.594
LAURA: I want to look for flowers too, then!

01:08:58.594 --> 01:09:00.434
MATT: We'll come to that in a little bit.

01:09:00.434 --> 01:09:02.876
LIAM: I rolled a 19 for Buch.

01:09:02.876 --> 01:09:04.780
MATT: Okay, good to keep that in mind as we move
on.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.680
MARISHA: We go pick up some more snappers and
poppers, poppers and snappers.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.619
MATT: You go back to those two vendors. They're
both set up on the side. The one guy with the

01:09:12.619 --> 01:09:18.833
sparklers is still set up there, and the guy with
the fireworks is still resting there on the edge,

01:09:18.833 --> 01:09:22.992
and the other guy with the flowers is set up on
the side. There's one guy with the sparklers and

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:26.962
the fireworks who's there, the thin, somewhat
dopey-looking, young gnomish guy, and you have the

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:31.877
flower vendor, who's slowly settled into himself,
like a barrel of a gnome.

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:37.490
MARISHA: Nott, the flower guy's creepy. Just felt
like throwing that out there before we approach.

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:39.601
SAM: Okay. All right, thank you.

01:09:39.601 --> 01:09:42.627
MARISHA: I go up to the snapper and popper guys.

01:09:42.627 --> 01:09:45.182
MATT: "Hey! Welcome back."

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:46.810
MARISHA: Need more packs.

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:50.070
SAM: No. I want something more powerful.

01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:54.335
MARISHA: Plus all the packs.

01:09:54.335 --> 01:10:00.053
MATT: "I don't really have anything more powerful
than these."

01:10:00.053 --> 01:10:01.395
MARISHA: Where do you find more powerful?

01:10:01.395 --> 01:10:03.943
SAM: Can you make something?

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:07.574
TRAVIS: We're arms dealing on fucking party
night.

01:10:07.574 --> 01:10:13.032
MATT: He's, at this point, locking eyes with you,
Nott, and there's like a look of recognition in his face.

01:10:13.032 --> 01:10:15.534
SAM: Gulp.

01:10:18.003 --> 01:10:21.939
MATT: "I don't have anything of that variety. I'm
sorry."

01:10:23.179 --> 01:10:27.125
MARISHA: Hey, Nott, do you want to-- just stand by
me.

01:10:27.125 --> 01:10:30.284
SAM: I swoop back into the shadows and mingle.

01:10:30.284 --> 01:10:33.155
TRAVIS: Narc.

01:10:33.155 --> 01:10:41.232
MARISHA: Hey, don't-- why are your eyes wandering
at her? What was that?

01:10:41.232 --> 01:10:43.258
MATT: "Sorry, we're closing shop up for the
night."

01:10:43.258 --> 01:10:44.803
MARISHA: No, give me your packs!

01:10:44.803 --> 01:10:47.379
MATT: Then he goes and closes up his little
satchel and walks away.

01:10:47.379 --> 01:10:50.171
MARISHA: Oh, you piece of shit.

01:10:50.171 --> 01:10:51.812
SAM: Sorry, that was my fault.

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:54.969
MARISHA: Hey, don't ever apologize for who you
are, man.

01:10:54.969 --> 01:10:55.960
SAM: No, I--

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.270
MARISHA: You can't help that shit, first off.

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:01.437
SAM: I should have known. I can't talk to people.

01:11:01.437 --> 01:11:03.330
MARISHA: You can't predict when people are going
to be shitty.

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:08.282
SAM: They're always shitty. It's a 100% accurate
prediction.

01:11:08.282 --> 01:11:11.520
MARISHA: That's pretty-- that's a good point.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:17.074
SAM: By the way, Beau, thank you for the other
day.

01:11:17.074 --> 01:11:18.391
MARISHA: When?

01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:22.055
SAM: For talking to Caleb through his, you know.

01:11:22.055 --> 01:11:28.576
MARISHA: Yeah, he's a good guy.

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:35.539
SAM: Just be sensitive around him. I know that
that's not your strong suit, but he doesn't deal

01:11:35.539 --> 01:11:39.634
well with harsh criticism all the time.

01:11:39.634 --> 01:11:41.843
MARISHA: And you think you do?

01:11:41.843 --> 01:11:43.705
SAM: I'm used to it.

01:11:43.705 --> 01:11:45.705
MARISHA: That's true.

01:11:45.705 --> 01:11:51.288
SAM: Tell me something, how did you know about
this place?

01:11:51.288 --> 01:11:52.977
MARISHA: Hupperdook?

01:11:52.977 --> 01:11:58.107
SAM: Yeah, how did you know that the gnomes here
get down with the funky fresh rhythm all night?

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:06.782
MARISHA: The job that I had before I met up with
you guys, in Zadash, information passes through.

01:12:06.782 --> 01:12:08.219
You hear things.

01:12:08.219 --> 01:12:10.725
SAM: What job?

01:12:10.725 --> 01:12:16.333
MARISHA: I worked at a library, the Cobalt Soul
library.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.886
SAM: What's a Cobalt Soul?

01:12:18.886 --> 01:12:22.976
MARISHA: It is a faction of monks.

01:12:22.976 --> 01:12:28.762
SAM: What kind of a faction of monks?

01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:32.606
TRAVIS: Is Nott slurring her words?

01:12:32.606 --> 01:12:35.506
SAM: Are you evil? Are you a bad guy?

01:12:35.506 --> 01:12:44.458
MARISHA: No, I hope not. I think it differs from
day to day, depending on what I'm doing. Do you

01:12:44.458 --> 01:12:46.540
think I'm a bad guy?

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.885
SAM: I don't think so.

01:12:48.885 --> 01:12:50.487
MARISHA: That's all that matters, right?

01:12:50.487 --> 01:12:58.404
SAM: But I don't know, you seem to know a lot
about a lot of things and sketchy things, too.

01:12:58.404 --> 01:13:01.607
MARISHA: That has to do with the job that I had
before the job that I had.

01:13:01.607 --> 01:13:08.694
SAM: What was that job? I thought you grew up--
didn't your parents make wine or something?

01:13:08.694 --> 01:13:10.208
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:13:10.208 --> 01:13:19.609
SAM: What was this about a job? Wait, little
townsgirl, her parents are wine makers, now you're

01:13:19.609 --> 01:13:28.029
a brutal assassin martial artist who can kill
anything. What happened in between those two things?

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:29.603
MARISHA: Yeah, there's definitely something
missing, right?

01:13:29.603 --> 01:13:31.008
SAM: Yeah, right?

01:13:31.008 --> 01:13:38.009
MARISHA: Let's catch up with the others while we
walk and talk.

01:13:38.176 --> 01:13:39.225
SAM: Sure.

01:13:39.225 --> 01:13:47.592
MARISHA: My dad was super protective and I was an
asshole and rebelled a lot.

01:13:47.592 --> 01:13:49.430
SAM: You? No!

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:58.850
MARISHA: Yeah. You know, so when interesting and
different people would pass through my hometown I

01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:06.452
started making some connections, started getting
involved in some mainly illegal trading.

01:14:06.452 --> 01:14:09.237
SAM: Like what? What kind of stuff?

01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:16.866
MARISHA: I got in really big trouble from my
parents because I started syphoning his cases of

01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:24.896
wine and selling them underground for half the
cost, without tariffs.

01:14:24.896 --> 01:14:27.983
SAM: You were bootlegging your old man's hooch?

01:14:27.983 --> 01:14:29.146
MARISHA: Yes, I was.

01:14:29.146 --> 01:14:30.126
TRAVIS: Industrious.

01:14:30.126 --> 01:14:31.087
SAM: Wow.

01:14:31.087 --> 01:14:38.318
MARISHA: Yeah. On top of other things, that was
like my big denouement, you know? I don't know, I

01:14:38.318 --> 01:14:42.609
just grew to hate the town that I was in and the
system that my father was a part of

01:14:42.609 --> 01:14:45.015
and so everything--

01:14:45.015 --> 01:14:46.916
SAM: Is he a bad person?

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:58.058
MARISHA: He wasn't a bad person. I think he just
had bad direction. I don't know, he could've been

01:14:58.058 --> 01:15:03.306
a good dad. He was a shitty dad and a good
businessman.

01:15:03.306 --> 01:15:06.826
SAM: So you took matters into your own hands?

01:15:06.826 --> 01:15:07.957
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:15:07.957 --> 01:15:11.287
SAM: And got in trouble, and were sent off to
boarding school?

01:15:11.287 --> 01:15:15.156
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of.

01:15:15.156 --> 01:15:20.439
SAM: With monks who are librarians and taught you
how to kill with your fists.

01:15:20.439 --> 01:15:25.323
MARISHA: One day, he found out about what I was
doing after I'd already gotten in trouble for, you

01:15:25.323 --> 01:15:33.054
know, a little bit of mild extortion, and a little
bit of trading, little bit of trafficking. So I

01:15:33.054 --> 01:15:38.230
think he was already pretty irritated with me.
Then he found out about my smuggling scheme with

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:45.074
his wine. One day, he called me down into the
living room and there was a whole group of monks

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:50.638
and people in black. I tried to fight them off and
they grabbed me and they drug me away.

01:15:50.638 --> 01:15:54.619
SAM: Wait, this was not by choice? You were
abducted by monks?!

01:15:54.619 --> 01:15:58.365
MARISHA: My dad paid to get me abducted by monks,
yeah.

01:15:58.365 --> 01:16:00.628
SAM: Oh my gosh.

01:16:00.628 --> 01:16:02.245
MARISHA: He wasn't very proud.

01:16:02.245 --> 01:16:05.432
SAM: Are you okay?

01:16:05.432 --> 01:16:08.619
MARISHA: Sure. Great.

01:16:08.619 --> 01:16:10.729
SAM: Was it hard?

01:16:10.729 --> 01:16:18.603
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, there were elements that
were hard, but everyone has had hardships, right?

01:16:18.603 --> 01:16:28.518
What's it matter? Besides, he sent me off to the
monks. I think he was hoping that they were going

01:16:28.518 --> 01:16:37.158
to beat my indiscretions out of me. Instead, I
think all of the things that my father saw in me

01:16:37.158 --> 01:16:45.820
that he hated, the monks saw as a potential
advantage. So, in a weird way, I think it might've

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:52.978
been the nicest thing he ever did for me.

01:16:52.978 --> 01:17:02.322
SAM: I've never thought of you as an optimistic
person, but that's a very positive way of looking at it.

01:17:02.322 --> 01:17:04.946
MARISHA: I mean, I still never really want to see
him again, and I don't think he wants to see me

01:17:04.946 --> 01:17:14.539
again, either. In fact, he told that he didn't
want to see me again. So it's good. Yeah.

01:17:14.539 --> 01:17:17.876
MATT: At this point, you guys are caught up with
the rest of the crowd as you guys have meandered

01:17:17.876 --> 01:17:22.376
your way and look up and you can see the rest of
your party has been wandering the street.

01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:31.208
MARISHA: But, I do have a nice little wineskin
that I keep reserved, of my family's wine,

01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:32.548
if you want to taste.

01:17:32.548 --> 01:17:34.969
SAM: I would. Very much.

01:17:34.969 --> 01:17:36.582
MARISHA: I toss Nott the wine.

01:17:36.582 --> 01:17:41.317
SAM: I'll just take a little sip, in case we have
to do the Hour of Power later.

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:45.396
MATT: It's pretty damn good wine.

01:17:45.396 --> 01:17:47.578
SAM: Wow. That's amazing.

01:17:47.578 --> 01:17:50.134
MARISHA: Anybody else wants a sip of my heritage?

01:17:50.134 --> 01:17:52.565
TALIESIN: Is that code for something?

01:17:52.565 --> 01:17:58.406
LIAM: It is hard to believe, but I was able to do
the-- I danced the waltz and the tarantella.

01:17:58.406 --> 01:18:00.055
It's been many years.

01:18:00.055 --> 01:18:02.918
LAURA: Well, you should show me sometime, because
I want to see it.

01:18:02.918 --> 01:18:05.055
LIAM: I am very much out of practice, and--

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:07.371
LAURA: We can do it when nobody's watching, okay?

01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:09.449
TALIESIN: I could see you as a waltzer. That make
sense.

01:18:09.449 --> 01:18:11.956
LIAM: It does. A little bit.

01:18:11.956 --> 01:18:14.105
LAURA: I'm really good at the waltz.

01:18:14.105 --> 01:18:15.469
LIAM: I believe it.

01:18:15.469 --> 01:18:18.502
LAURA: Yeah. They taught me the same time I
learned piano.

01:18:18.502 --> 01:18:23.756
LIAM: Is there anything else that you're hiding
from us? Any other quirks or skills?

01:18:23.756 --> 01:18:25.973
LAURA: So many. Lots of skills.

01:18:25.973 --> 01:18:27.327
LIAM: What are three more?

01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:38.323
LAURA: I can paint. I'm really good at baking
scones. Specifically scones.

01:18:38.323 --> 01:18:39.310
TRAVIS: With cinnamon, right?

01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:40.352
LAURA: With cinnamon.

01:18:40.352 --> 01:18:41.508
MARISHA: Scones are hard to make.

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:43.566
LAURA: I know. It's a very tough recipe, but I'm
good at it.

01:18:43.566 --> 01:18:49.577
SAM: The trick is to not overmix. You don't want
to overmix. Oh, sorry. We've been walking with

01:18:49.577 --> 01:18:51.014
your friend, Beau.

01:18:51.014 --> 01:18:53.015
LIAM: Wait. Hold that thought. So that's two
things.

01:18:53.015 --> 01:18:53.926
LAURA: Yes.

01:18:53.926 --> 01:18:55.077
LIAM: And the third is?

01:18:55.077 --> 01:18:58.153
LAURA: The third thing is something that I want to
talk to Fjord about. Because if he's that

01:18:58.153 --> 01:19:01.372
inexperienced, then maybe he should take some
lessons or something.

01:19:01.372 --> 01:19:05.846
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:19:05.846 --> 01:19:13.055
SAM: Time is of the essence. He might be with a
lady of the night later tonight. You might have to

01:19:13.055 --> 01:19:14.484
teach him quickly.

01:19:14.484 --> 01:19:15.378
LAURA: That's true.

01:19:15.378 --> 01:19:17.691
LIAM: And was that skill learned or innate?

01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:19.116
SAM: Cram school.

01:19:19.116 --> 01:19:23.612
LAURA: No. It really was more of a learning sort
of thing.

01:19:23.612 --> 01:19:24.786
LIAM: Yeah, study is key.

01:19:24.786 --> 01:19:26.639
LAURA: Yes. It's all about studying.

01:19:26.639 --> 01:19:28.855
LIAM: That's true.

01:19:28.855 --> 01:19:35.643
MATT: At this moment, Caleb, in listening to this
conversation, your eyes focus on a sign post

01:19:35.643 --> 01:19:39.290
behind her on a building that reads Bent Binders.

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:50.211
LIAM: I'm done here. I walk towards the store. Is
it open?

01:19:50.211 --> 01:19:51.736
MATT: No. The windows are closed.

01:19:51.736 --> 01:19:54.977
LIAM: Oh my gosh. I press my nose to the glass and
try to see what I can see. Is there a lot of books

01:19:54.977 --> 01:19:56.496
in there? Or just a few books? Or--

01:19:56.496 --> 01:19:57.416
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:19:57.416 --> 01:19:58.741
LIAM: Okay.

01:19:58.741 --> 01:20:04.622
LAURA: I'll go put my nose next to his nose on the
glass. What are we looking for?

01:20:04.622 --> 01:20:06.186
LIAM: That's a 16.

01:20:06.186 --> 01:20:10.894
MATT: As you look through, the combination of the
two of you, eventually the glass fogs up and you

01:20:10.894 --> 01:20:15.962
can't see anything. But from the brief moment you
had, on the inside, it looks like there are a few

01:20:15.962 --> 01:20:20.614
shelves that contains some books. It looks like
there is actually a binding press and tools for

01:20:20.614 --> 01:20:22.756
bookbinding in there.

01:20:22.756 --> 01:20:27.773
LIAM: From what I can tell, does it look like a
technical place where they are just making books

01:20:27.773 --> 01:20:29.701
or do they have books for sale?

01:20:29.701 --> 01:20:32.991
MATT: It looks like they have books for sale, but
it's too dark for you to see if they are blank or

01:20:32.991 --> 01:20:34.735
if they are actual books at the moment.

01:20:34.735 --> 01:20:37.189
LIAM: I cannot tell if it's a happy or a sad
bookstore.

01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:41.343
MATT: You cannot tell yet, no. Just like
Christmas, you must wait 'til the morning.

01:20:41.343 --> 01:20:43.842
(laughter)

01:20:44.404 --> 01:20:46.700
LAURA: Are there any silk flowers? I was looking
for those.

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:48.853
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:20:51.294 --> 01:20:53.248
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yay!

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:55.394
SAM: Yeah. Tonight, when it doesn't matter, you
roll great.

01:20:55.394 --> 01:20:58.230
LAURA: Shut up. 15.

01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:04.250
MATT: Actually, as you guys are fogging up the
window, you pull back and look to the left, and

01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:12.020
you can see this adorable little gnome girl with
deep tan skin, her hair pulled in these cute

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:16.475
little puffy buns in the side of her head, and she
has this little basket that is just filled with

01:21:16.475 --> 01:21:22.092
these different-colored silk-material flowers.
She's standing there, smiling, and you can see an

01:21:22.092 --> 01:21:28.181
older gnome sitting in a rocking chair behind her
with a big old pipe coming out of his mouth as the

01:21:28.181 --> 01:21:31.200
hat is half-covering his face and he's just
sitting there, rocking next to her.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:36.027
LAURA: I hop over next to her. (gasps) I've been
looking everywhere for you.

01:21:36.027 --> 01:21:37.153
MATT: "Really?"

01:21:37.153 --> 01:21:37.926
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:38.953
MATT: "Hi."

01:21:38.953 --> 01:21:41.923
LAURA: You have the best flowers I've ever seen
and I would like to buy some.

01:21:41.923 --> 01:21:45.624
MATT: "Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much. Okay."

01:21:45.624 --> 01:21:48.347
LAURA: How much is a flower?

01:21:48.347 --> 01:21:57.028
MATT: "Dad, how much is a flower?" The guy sitting
there rocking goes, "Take them a silver apiece.

01:21:57.028 --> 01:21:58.447
"Sorry, copper."

01:21:58.447 --> 01:21:59.932
LAURA: A copper apiece.

01:21:59.932 --> 01:22:02.968
MATT: "Yeah."

01:22:02.968 --> 01:22:03.741
LAURA: I will buy--

01:22:03.741 --> 01:22:05.201
MATT: "Copper."

01:22:05.201 --> 01:22:08.224
LAURA: I will buy ten flowers from you.

01:22:08.224 --> 01:22:12.604
MATT: "You will get ten flowers from me.
Lickety-split." She goes and takes out a handful,

01:22:12.604 --> 01:22:14.643
counts them in your hand, "One, two--"

01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:15.543
LAURA: How old are you?

01:22:15.543 --> 01:22:16.869
MATT: "--three-- I am five."

01:22:16.869 --> 01:22:22.109
LAURA: You are five? That's wonderful. Does your
dad take good care of you?

01:22:22.109 --> 01:22:24.788
MATT: "Yes. He's a good dad."

01:22:24.788 --> 01:22:26.033
LAURA: Are you a good dad?

01:22:26.033 --> 01:22:26.805
MATT: "What number is that?"

01:22:26.805 --> 01:22:28.894
LAURA: I think that-- I don't know. I wasn't
counting.

01:22:28.894 --> 01:22:30.292
LIAM: 13. That was 13.

01:22:30.292 --> 01:22:38.889
LAURA: 13. I'll buy 13. I give her two silvers.
You know, I happen to have a little girl with me

01:22:38.889 --> 01:22:42.324
who is very cool and I think she would like to
play with you.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.791
MATT: "What?"

01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:47.783
LAURA: Mm-hmm. She's extra special, though, so
you'd have to be very nice to her.

01:22:47.783 --> 01:22:49.440
MATT: "Oh, I'm very special, too."

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.266
LAURA: (gasps) Really?

01:22:50.266 --> 01:22:51.403
MATT: "Yeah!"

01:22:51.403 --> 01:22:56.552
LAURA: Where do you live? Because I could bring
her over and you could play together tomorrow.

01:22:56.552 --> 01:23:02.155
MATT: "The house is two buildings down that way
and back one street. You could see it has the red

01:23:02.155 --> 01:23:05.390
"brick on the base, by the door."

01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:08.741
LAURA: Red brick on the base by door. I'll come
see you guys tomorrow.

01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:10.157
MATT: "Okay. What's your name?"

01:23:10.157 --> 01:23:11.891
LAURA: My name is Jester. What's your name?

01:23:11.891 --> 01:23:12.943
MATT: "Tara."

01:23:12.943 --> 01:23:14.176
LAURA: Tara, so nice to meet you.

01:23:14.176 --> 01:23:15.222
MATT: "Nice to meet you, too."

01:23:15.222 --> 01:23:19.585
LAURA: Red brick by the door.

01:23:19.585 --> 01:23:23.328
MATT: There's this pause, and she goes, "Okay.
Bye."

01:23:23.328 --> 01:23:24.295
LAURA: Okay. See you!

01:23:24.295 --> 01:23:27.405
MATT: Then runs back and goes, "Dad, dad, dad,"
and starts taking the copper and puts it in his

01:23:27.405 --> 01:23:32.753
hand and he's, like, "Oh, that's a fine job." He
pulls his hat up a bit and takes the coin. He

01:23:32.753 --> 01:23:35.947
looks over to you as you walk away and--

01:23:35.947 --> 01:23:37.784
LAURA: Does he seem like a nice dad?

01:23:37.784 --> 01:23:40.115
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:23:41.426 --> 01:23:42.984
TALIESIN: No.

01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:44.862
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. 22

01:23:44.862 --> 01:23:46.953
MATT: Seems like a nice enough dad. Yeah.

01:23:46.953 --> 01:23:49.078
MARISHA: Happy Father's Day.

01:23:49.078 --> 01:23:55.739
MATT: Anything else you guys wish to do? It's
starting to get relatively close to that hour window.

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.349
LAURA: Do you want many of them? Because I just
bought a bunch.

01:23:57.349 --> 01:23:58.725
TALIESIN: I'll take two, then. Yep.

01:23:58.725 --> 01:24:00.195
LAURA: Flowers?

01:24:00.195 --> 01:24:00.968
SAM: Yes, please.

01:24:00.968 --> 01:24:01.738
LAURA: Flower?

01:24:01.738 --> 01:24:02.333
LIAM: One, please.

01:24:02.333 --> 01:24:03.195
LAURA: Flower?

01:24:03.195 --> 01:24:07.966
TRAVIS: Are there any authorities walking the
street? Any crownsguard or kingsguard or--?

01:24:07.966 --> 01:24:14.510
MATT: There are crownsguard. It's interesting,
because there are half and half. For the large

01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:19.248
gnomish population here, you see half of the
crownsguard are gnomish, and many of them have

01:24:19.248 --> 01:24:25.969
some form of firearm slung over their back and
shoulders. The other half appear to be human or

01:24:25.969 --> 01:24:36.042
half-elf. The human/half-elf crownsguard appear to
be less jovial and really paying attention to the

01:24:36.042 --> 01:24:40.865
chaos and generally trying to keep an eye out for
anything untoward.

01:24:40.865 --> 01:24:45.280
TRAVIS: Just like sentry, though. They're not
concerned or turgid or stiff?

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:52.029
MATT: In comparison to the rest of the people that
are currently celebrating, yes. But even the

01:24:52.029 --> 01:24:57.711
gnomish crownsguard seem to be taking their job
seriously, but they're still part of the event.

01:24:57.711 --> 01:24:58.694
TRAVIS: Among their folks?

01:24:58.694 --> 01:25:02.272
MATT: You get the sense here that everyone else
gets to celebrate and party at this hour and they

01:25:02.272 --> 01:25:10.128
don't get to, so they cheat a little bit.
Honestly, there's more crownsguard at night than

01:25:10.128 --> 01:25:13.770
you expected. When you came into the city, it
didn't seem that heavily guarded, but now they're

01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:19.891
out in a pretty serious force. You gather probably
a combination of there being wartime, or because

01:25:19.891 --> 01:25:28.990
the nature of what this city builds. As you're
glancing out, on the outside of the ledge of this

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:34.830
upper area, looking down, there are a number of
torches out by where the construction yards are

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:39.277
down below. Either people are working through the
night down there, or there's a fairly heavy

01:25:39.277 --> 01:25:44.843
presence of crownsguard present around these
partially-constructed devices and machines of war

01:25:44.843 --> 01:25:47.568
that you saw being worked on earlier in the day.

01:25:47.568 --> 01:25:50.836
TRAVIS: Looks like they even go through the night.
That's some dedication.

01:25:50.836 --> 01:25:52.769
TALIESIN: That seems like a bit much, doesn't it?

01:25:52.769 --> 01:25:57.980
TRAVIS: Yeah. Work ethic can choke you in that
way. Well, it's about that time. Should we make

01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:01.524
our way back for whatever this is going to be?

01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:03.194
TALIESIN: I got what I needed. I'm ready.

01:26:03.194 --> 01:26:04.762
LIAM: Just a second. Nott, come here for a
moment.

01:26:04.762 --> 01:26:06.565
SAM: Yes, Caleb, what is it?

01:26:06.565 --> 01:26:07.768
LIAM: Are you going to dance?

01:26:07.768 --> 01:26:10.305
SAM: Well, I think we're going to drink first.

01:26:10.305 --> 01:26:13.414
LIAM: Yeah. But later, it seems like you want to.
I think you should.

01:26:13.414 --> 01:26:15.217
SAM: I do like to dance.

01:26:15.217 --> 01:26:21.407
LIAM: Well, you should try it. You should enjoy
yourself, but make sure that either Jester or I

01:26:21.407 --> 01:26:23.807
ties your mask on very tightly, yeah?

01:26:23.807 --> 01:26:28.872
SAM: Should I do the spell that you told me, the
disguising spell, before the dance?

01:26:28.872 --> 01:26:30.820
LIAM: I mean, it would not be a bad idea.

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:32.697
SAM: All right. I'll do that.

01:26:32.697 --> 01:26:39.525
LIAM: All the same. Maybe stay away from direct
light, you know? If you can stay a little bit away from it.

01:26:40.124 --> 01:26:42.570
SAM: Oh, because the shadows won't match.

01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:48.081
LIAM: Ja, and some people are smart and it won't
work.

01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:53.156
SAM: Okay. I will. But you'll keep an eye out in
case anyone--

01:26:53.156 --> 01:26:55.000
LIAM: That is exactly what I will do.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.551
SAM: All right. Thank you.

01:26:57.551 --> 01:26:59.618
LIAM: You should enjoy yourself.

01:26:59.618 --> 01:27:13.242
SAM: I'll try. If you want to join us, you could
just point and clap, off to the side. You don't

01:27:13.242 --> 01:27:16.580
have to dance. You can be there to, like--

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:21.832
MARISHA: You guys know that dancing is about
spontaneity and you are planning this dance, like

01:27:21.832 --> 01:27:23.873
when this is going to happen, so hard.

01:27:23.873 --> 01:27:25.990
LIAM: I am not dancing, so it is not really an
issue.

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:27.050
MARISHA: Let your heart go.

01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:30.238
LAURA: When you're performing, you have to have
specific moves.

01:27:30.238 --> 01:27:32.168
MARISHA: Sure.

01:27:32.168 --> 01:27:38.024
SAM: You saw the guys who kicked you in the face.
They had planned-out moves that were really cool.

01:27:38.024 --> 01:27:40.959
LAURA: Yeah. Like choreography. That's what we're
talking about here.

01:27:40.959 --> 01:27:42.587
TALIESIN: They kick someone in the face every
time.

01:27:42.587 --> 01:27:44.509
MARISHA: I like dancing to dance.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:51.884
SAM: All right. We'll do choreography to the right
and left, and you two be in the middle and just freestyle.

01:27:51.884 --> 01:27:57.814
LAURA: I think that will work out well. Make sure
you use your scarves, though.

01:27:57.814 --> 01:28:00.047
MARISHA: Do you guys still have one of those
wands?

01:28:00.047 --> 01:28:02.029
SAM: What wands? The Wand of Smiles?

01:28:02.029 --> 01:28:08.954
LAURA: I have that. I hit a random person with the
Wand of Smiles as we walk by them.

01:28:08.954 --> 01:28:18.188
MATT: The gentleman who's selling the flower bands
is sitting, already smiling, and goes--

01:28:22.794 --> 01:28:25.010
LAURA: That guy knows.

01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:30.754
MARISHA: Here. I take off my belt ribbon and I tie
it around your Wand of Smiles. Now you have a

01:28:30.754 --> 01:28:32.325
ribbon dancer of smiles.

01:28:32.325 --> 01:28:35.920
LAURA: Ah!

01:28:36.431 --> 01:28:39.311
TRAVIS: How many charges does that thing have?

01:28:39.311 --> 01:28:41.533
LAURA: I don't remember.

01:28:41.533 --> 01:28:43.239
SAM: That's probably it for the day.

01:28:43.239 --> 01:28:45.350
MARISHA: It recharges, right? Over time?

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:51.573
MATT: Yeah, it has a few uses on it per day. You
guys return to the Blushing Tankard Tavern. The

01:28:51.573 --> 01:28:58.814
music's still blaring. Drinks are being thrown
around. A bunch of people are singing big, old

01:28:58.814 --> 01:29:02.951
songs and clanking their tankards together and
spilling onto the tabletops. The floor is already

01:29:02.951 --> 01:29:11.238
slick with spilled liquor here and there. It is a
party that hasn't stopped since you left. As you

01:29:11.238 --> 01:29:18.109
guys begin to enter, the dwarven woman who you had
spoken with earlier gets onto one of the central

01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:24.609
tables and slams her foot on the table. Everyone
starts looking over and she goes, "Attention,

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:32.749
"arseholes! Might I have your leering eyes upon
this supple and available specimen of a woman?"

01:29:32.749 --> 01:29:41.153
You hear some whistles. "Oh, thank you." She bends
forward with a wink to the crowd. "It's as you've

01:29:41.153 --> 01:29:49.307
"all been waiting for: The Hour of Honor!" "Yeah!"
Cheers, clapping. "The tokens and titles are at

01:29:49.307 --> 01:29:57.537
"stake. Ol' Blemmy and his crew hold this winner's
tokens for the last three weeks," and she gestures

01:29:57.537 --> 01:30:03.458
over and you can see a team there, mostly of
gnomes. Ol' Blemmy is this dwarf with one giant

01:30:03.458 --> 01:30:08.869
gash down his face, and the snow-blind eye in that
socket is sitting there with this tuft of a beard

01:30:08.869 --> 01:30:14.766
that has been so unkempt that you can't see his
mouth. It's this gray-black, salt-and-pepper bush

01:30:14.766 --> 01:30:19.174
that disappears into a chin beard. You assume he's
grinning beneath there.

01:30:19.174 --> 01:30:20.442
TALIESIN: Like Bread Papa?

01:30:20.442 --> 01:30:22.704
MATT: Kind of, yeah. Beard Papa?

01:30:22.704 --> 01:30:26.120
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's all Beard Papa.

01:30:26.724 --> 01:30:32.572
MATT: "They're not willing to let them go! Who
wants to put up their coin and their balls to

01:30:32.572 --> 01:30:40.526
"topple these nobodies?" (chuckling) Folks start
standing up and tossing some coin on the table at

01:30:40.526 --> 01:30:47.386
her feet and shouting out, "Five silver!" "A gold
piece!" "Three gold over here!" People are

01:30:47.386 --> 01:30:50.549
standing up and their groups are starting to get
amped up and ready. She's like, "Keep them coming,

01:30:50.549 --> 01:30:52.469
"keep them coming!"

01:30:52.469 --> 01:30:53.615
TALIESIN: Ten gold?

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:54.533
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:56.569
TALIESIN: Ten gold.

01:30:56.569 --> 01:31:02.007
MATT: "Whoa. By the colorful newcomers-- hi there,
sweetie!"

01:31:02.007 --> 01:31:03.318
TRAVIS: Oh god.

01:31:03.732 --> 01:31:12.652
MATT: "Do we have more than ten gold here to try
and take down these giants of drinking?" There's a

01:31:12.652 --> 01:31:17.597
moment, and this one group in the corner, these
coal-smeared gnomes that come from-- you can

01:31:17.597 --> 01:31:23.045
assume now this is probably a heavy mining town.
They're sitting there with elements of their

01:31:23.045 --> 01:31:27.426
leather work clothes still on, and they're all
thinking and talking amongst themselves, and they

01:31:27.426 --> 01:31:31.113
all pull in a few more coins, and one of them
comes forward, still wearing leather gloves from

01:31:31.113 --> 01:31:34.217
the day and pops down, "15 gold."

01:31:34.217 --> 01:31:36.706
TRAVIS: Hmm, shit.

01:31:36.706 --> 01:31:38.195
MARISHA: 16!

01:31:42.045 --> 01:31:43.351
MATT: "18."

01:31:45.319 --> 01:31:46.675
LAURA: 20 gold!

01:31:49.617 --> 01:31:57.042
MATT: He goes back, talking to them. Comes back,
"25 gold pieces."

01:31:57.042 --> 01:32:04.780
LAURA: Oh, come on! I don't even know if I want to
do that for 20 gold.

01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:08.026
TALIESIN: I just don't know how to walk away from
something like this.

01:32:08.026 --> 01:32:10.887
MARISHA: 25 and five silver!

01:32:10.887 --> 01:32:12.447
SAM: So petty.

01:32:12.447 --> 01:32:14.778
TALIESIN: Oh for god's sake, 30 gold.

01:32:14.778 --> 01:32:15.793
TRAVIS: Price is right.

01:32:15.793 --> 01:32:23.671
MATT: At that point, everyone goes, "Whoa!" With a
flourish, you place the rest of the 30 gold piece

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:26.719
pot on the table. "Ooh."

01:32:26.719 --> 01:32:28.424
TALIESIN: So you'll all be giving me a little bit
of gold for this later.

01:32:28.424 --> 01:32:33.544
MATT: "So?" Turns back and looks back at the
miners, and they all go (heavy sigh).

01:32:33.544 --> 01:32:34.646
TALIESIN: We'll be out of town in a week.

01:32:34.646 --> 01:32:40.147
MATT: They gather their gold off the table back
again, and Irena goes, "Well, if that's it, it

01:32:40.147 --> 01:32:44.726
"looks like our contenders for the night are--
(quietly) what are you called?"

01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:46.889
TALIESIN: The Mighty Nein.

01:32:46.889 --> 01:32:50.039
MATT: "The Mighty Nein!"

01:32:50.039 --> 01:32:52.709
TALIESIN: If I want to be known for something,
this is exactly what I want to be known for.

01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:55.789
MATT: Cheers and clamoring continue around, and
everyone starts shouting and yelling.

01:32:55.789 --> 01:33:00.980
"All right, let's set up these drinks people!"
With that final slam on the table, she leaps off

01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:07.068
onto the ground and starts heading off towards the
bar on the side. The other bartender-- the gnomish

01:33:07.068 --> 01:33:11.053
gentleman there is rapidly clearing out tankards
and drinks, and he's starting to pull up bottles

01:33:11.053 --> 01:33:16.398
onto the countertop. They start pushing tables
into the center again once more as the crowds

01:33:16.398 --> 01:33:23.107
begin to circle around, and Ol' Blemmy and the
rest of his rather rough-looking crew that have

01:33:23.107 --> 01:33:26.396
seen some life in their time--

01:33:26.396 --> 01:33:27.933
TRAVIS: Fraternity all-stars.

01:33:27.933 --> 01:33:33.829
MATT: They're all pretty much gnomish middle-age,
which could be anywhere between 100 to 200 years

01:33:33.829 --> 01:33:39.282
old, and you can see the weathering on their faces
and their clothing. They look like they nearly

01:33:39.282 --> 01:33:45.122
drink professionally. They step up to the table
and they figure out what order they're going to go

01:33:45.122 --> 01:33:47.201
in. You guys figure out what order you're going to
go in?

01:33:47.201 --> 01:33:48.123
SAM: Are we all going?

01:33:48.123 --> 01:33:49.627
TRAVIS: Anybody who wants in.

01:33:49.627 --> 01:33:53.627
MATT: There's five on their team, and talking to
her a bit, she goes, "All right,

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:57.305
there's five competitors. You need to pick five of
your team to compete."

01:33:57.305 --> 01:33:59.596
SAM: Who's the worst at drinking?

01:33:59.596 --> 01:34:02.728
LAURA: Well, I've never been drunk.

01:34:02.728 --> 01:34:05.372
SAM: Then maybe you should sit this one out.

01:34:05.372 --> 01:34:07.740
LAURA: But maybe I'm really good at it, you don't
know!

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:11.953
SAM: Do we want this to be the thing that we find
out on?

01:34:11.953 --> 01:34:14.086
TRAVIS: Probably not, Jester.

01:34:14.086 --> 01:34:15.850
TALIESIN: Caleb, how're you feeling?

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:19.796
LIAM: I don't think I should go late in the game,
but I feel capable of this challenge.

01:34:19.796 --> 01:34:21.204
TALIESIN: Excellent.

01:34:21.204 --> 01:34:22.148
TRAVIS: I can drink.

01:34:22.148 --> 01:34:23.617
MARISHA: I'm pretty good at it, too.

01:34:23.617 --> 01:34:25.994
TALIESIN: I'm ready for this.

01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:28.159
SAM: I've never had a drink in my life.

01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:31.707
TRAVIS: Our fucking team captain over here!

01:34:31.707 --> 01:34:34.624
MATT: Who's sitting it out amongst you guys?

01:34:34.624 --> 01:34:36.213
LAURA: I guess it will be me.

01:34:36.213 --> 01:34:37.282
TRAVIS: Well, we need five.

01:34:37.282 --> 01:34:38.365
MATT: You need five, yeah.

01:34:38.365 --> 01:34:41.467
LIAM: We have eins, zwei, drei, vier, und fünf.

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:43.682
SAM: Maybe you can be--

01:34:43.682 --> 01:34:47.798
LAURA: I'm taking my five gold back from him, and
I'm stomping upstairs.

01:34:47.798 --> 01:34:50.194
SAM: You could be the manager of the team!

01:34:50.194 --> 01:34:53.926
TALIESIN: You can also drink along since we'll
have to buy your drinks for you.

01:34:53.926 --> 01:34:56.625
MARISHA: I can also give you some magic mushrooms
if you want to slip them in their drinks.

01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:59.263
TRAVIS: It's fungus, actually.

01:34:59.263 --> 01:35:02.147
LAURA: Oh, but I can work distraction.

01:35:02.147 --> 01:35:09.361
SAM: Yes. You can use your clerical mysticism to
confuse and disrupt our enemy.

01:35:09.361 --> 01:35:13.792
LAURA: I stomp back down the stairs, and I join
them.

01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:17.260
MATT: As you're coming down, you notice, Jester,
the crowds are all gathering, and there's this big

01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:22.606
circle appearing around the central-- they have
two tables that are set up with a single bench

01:35:22.606 --> 01:35:27.295
each end. You can see a third table behind it
where there's probably going to be the dwarf woman

01:35:27.295 --> 01:35:32.168
overseeing this venture. You do see this little
gnome girl that's walking through the crowd, and

01:35:32.168 --> 01:35:34.137
her hands open, and people are--

01:35:34.137 --> 01:35:35.223
LAURA: Is it Tara?

01:35:35.223 --> 01:35:41.201
MATT: It's not Tara, actually, but it's a rather
dirty-looking gnome little girl who's thumbing

01:35:41.201 --> 01:35:45.215
through and getting pushed around a little bit,
her hands are out in front.

01:35:45.215 --> 01:35:49.100
LAURA: I give her a little money. I give her a
silver.

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:53.540
MATT: She takes it and, "Thank you," barely
audible voice, and continues wandering in the

01:35:53.540 --> 01:36:01.282
crowd. So, the five of you guys are doing it?

01:36:01.282 --> 01:36:02.608
SAM, TALIESIN, TRAVIS, MARISHA, and LIAM: Yes!

01:36:02.608 --> 01:36:08.006
MATT: At this point, the dwarf woman comes back to
the top of the tables there, looks out, "All

01:36:08.006 --> 01:36:16.640
"right, friends! I am but your humble evening
mistress, Irena Clommop. And it is my pleasure to

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:23.781
"present to you tonight's esteemed head-to-head
drinking battle between Ol' Blemmy and crew, and

01:36:23.781 --> 01:36:31.399
"The Mighty Nein. First up of Blemmy's crew, we
have Duncan!" You see this one gnome gentleman

01:36:31.399 --> 01:36:42.118
come forward. Patchy beard, more of a Stonewall
Jackson type, missing the centerpiece there. His

01:36:42.118 --> 01:36:48.610
eyes are bloodshot and red. His hair's slicked
back with some sort of a thick oil, and he's

01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:54.283
wearing a leather apron over a white, stained
shirt with the sleeves rolled up past his elbows.

01:36:54.283 --> 01:37:00.417
He sits up, gets on one end of the table, puts one
hand on his tankard, and is waiting for his

01:37:00.417 --> 01:37:05.785
competitor. "And on The Mighty Nein's side, who's
competing against old Duncan?"

01:37:05.785 --> 01:37:09.447
TRAVIS: Listen, the anchor needs to be you, Nott.
You're our ringer.

01:37:09.447 --> 01:37:11.855
SAM: All right. So I'll wait until there's--

01:37:11.855 --> 01:37:14.205
TRAVIS: Molly, do you want to kick us off?

01:37:14.205 --> 01:37:17.907
TALIESIN: I'll take this in. I'm going to Riker
right over the chair and sit down.

01:37:17.907 --> 01:37:19.651
MATT: "What's your name?"

01:37:19.651 --> 01:37:20.719
TALIESIN: Molly, dear.

01:37:20.719 --> 01:37:34.486
MATT: "Molly! All right. So we'll take turns." She
grabs this small barrel-- it's a handheld barrel--

01:37:34.486 --> 01:37:45.868
she pours both of your drinks to the brim. "When I
clap hands together, you both drink! It's not

01:37:45.868 --> 01:37:52.416
"first to finish, but it's one drink after the
next. First to pass out or lose their drink

01:37:52.416 --> 01:37:59.861
"forfeits. So with your drinks full, let's begin!"
With that, I need you to roll a constitution

01:37:59.861 --> 01:38:02.682
check. Roll a d20, add your constitution
modifier.

01:38:02.682 --> 01:38:03.662
TRAVIS: Warm it up.

01:38:03.662 --> 01:38:06.337
TALIESIN: Ten.

01:38:06.337 --> 01:38:09.557
MATT: You watch as Duncan, takes it (gulping).

01:38:09.557 --> 01:38:10.800
LAURA: No wait, add your constitution. 12!

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.671
TALIESIN: Oh, 12, sorry.

01:38:12.671 --> 01:38:18.333
MATT: You're drinking it and getting through it
fine. You're partway through your drink and he's

01:38:18.333 --> 01:38:22.117
already finished (slam) on the table. It was a
natural 20 on his end.

01:38:22.117 --> 01:38:23.702
ALL: Oh!

01:38:23.702 --> 01:38:27.818
MATT: You finish the drink, and you're like
(burp), a little effervescent, but it's there. So

01:38:27.818 --> 01:38:33.220
that's one loss on your end. How the rules work is
that the first to three losses is the one-- in

01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:35.328
these competitive spaces.

01:38:35.328 --> 01:38:38.324
MARISHA: So you have to drink fast? I thought you
just said it didn't matter how fast--

01:38:38.324 --> 01:38:43.966
MATT: No, that was just how fast he finished. The
idea is you both make competitive constitution

01:38:43.966 --> 01:38:49.884
checks and the first to three losses in that
competition is the one that either barfs or passes out.

01:38:49.884 --> 01:38:50.973
LIAM: Barf saves.

01:38:50.973 --> 01:38:52.254
MARISHA: Copy.

01:38:52.254 --> 01:38:56.859
MATT: Yeah, essentially. At that point, as soon as
you guys drop the drinks, "Next round!"

01:38:56.859 --> 01:39:00.292
Fills up both of them, the crowd starts cheering.
Go ahead and roll.

01:39:00.292 --> 01:39:01.657
MARISHA: Come on, Molly.

01:39:01.657 --> 01:39:04.158
TALIESIN: Ugh, goddamn it. Eight.

01:39:04.158 --> 01:39:06.991
MATT: He rolled a two plus two, so, four.

01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:08.109
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:11.821
MATT: This time around, you manage to finish a
little sooner than him. You put it down; he's like

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:17.283
(burp, then chuckling). Roll again. Fills up for
the third round.

01:39:17.283 --> 01:39:18.989
TALIESIN: 20.

01:39:18.989 --> 01:39:26.322
MATT: You finish your drink a little bit sooner
than him, plop it down. (burping, grunting) From

01:39:26.322 --> 01:39:32.956
behind him you hear Ol' Blemmy go, "Don't you lose
it, boy!" A voice that grates like it's been

01:39:32.956 --> 01:39:36.373
slammed across a hundred years of seawater.

01:39:36.373 --> 01:39:37.798
TRAVIS: Molly, how is it?

01:39:37.798 --> 01:39:39.350
TALIESIN: It's rough.

01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:43.074
MATT: Roll off again.

01:39:43.074 --> 01:39:44.148
TALIESIN: 19.

01:39:44.148 --> 01:39:45.549
MARISHA: Yes!

01:39:45.549 --> 01:39:50.357
MATT: You finish your drink. He takes his next
one, pops it down, and you both stare for a

01:39:50.357 --> 01:39:59.093
moment. (coughing and spitting) Down the front of
his shirt, the crowd's goes like, "No!" Tries to

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:04.444
scoop it back up, and they're like, "No, and
you're out!" Irena kicks him out of the chair,

01:40:04.444 --> 01:40:09.002
"And he's done! First round goes to The Mighty
Nein!"

01:40:09.002 --> 01:40:12.849
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

01:40:12.849 --> 01:40:16.540
MATT: He gets off the ground, dazed. You are
fucking drunk, Molly.

01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:19.210
TALIESIN: I'm very drunk.

01:40:19.210 --> 01:40:22.955
MATT: He topples back to you guys, you see Duncan
get pulled back in the crowd, and Ol' Blemmy's

01:40:22.955 --> 01:40:27.218
like (inaudible muttering) and under his breath,
you can hear a string of curse words.

01:40:27.218 --> 01:40:34.229
"Next up, we have Ruth!" You watch as this rotund,
tough-looking, oval of a gnomish woman comes up

01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:41.160
there, her hair pulled into really tight braids in
the side, with bright freckles and this grimace.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:49.241
This woman has seen some shit and lived. She gets
up to the side, takes the same tankard, and goes,

01:40:49.241 --> 01:40:54.380
"I'll show you how it's done, Duncan. Fill it!"

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:58.146
TRAVIS: She's got nothing on you. She's nothing!
You got this!

01:40:58.146 --> 01:41:02.283
MARISHA: My resting bitch face is stronger! And I
jump in.

01:41:02.283 --> 01:41:06.229
LAURA: I hop up on the table next to her and start
yelling: Beau! Beau!

01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:08.284
ALL: Beau! Beau!

01:41:08.284 --> 01:41:10.269
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:41:10.269 --> 01:41:14.229
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like
other people are chanting with me.

01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:16.170
MARISHA: Yes, girl, yes!

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:17.008
TALIESIN: That's a roll.

01:41:17.008 --> 01:41:18.456
LAURA: That's a 21!

01:41:18.456 --> 01:41:22.671
MATT: With that, the crowd starts picking up on
Beau, and the name, "Beau! Beau! Beau!" begins to

01:41:22.671 --> 01:41:30.375
resonate through the crowd. You lock eyes with
this gnomish woman and you can see there should be

01:41:30.638 --> 01:41:38.318
color, but the irises are gray-- slate gray-- and
it puts you off. There's this intensity to her

01:41:38.318 --> 01:41:40.638
that you're like, "Oh. This is--"

01:41:40.638 --> 01:41:42.219
MARISHA: Fjord, she has crazy eye.

01:41:42.219 --> 01:41:44.090
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:46.628
MARISHA: Do I have advantage because people are
chanting my name?

01:41:46.628 --> 01:41:52.152
MATT: No. But people are definitely invested in
this victory. Go ahead and make your first roll.

01:41:52.152 --> 01:41:57.396
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. 16.

01:41:57.396 --> 01:42:04.226
MATT: You both chug, slam it down at the same
exact time. Both hold tight. It was a tie.

01:42:04.667 --> 01:42:08.649
TRAVIS: Oh no, you're getting shithoused during
this round!

01:42:08.649 --> 01:42:09.548
MARISHA: Yeah, I am!

01:42:09.548 --> 01:42:14.342
MATT: They fill up the drinks. "And next round,
go!" Roll for it.

01:42:14.342 --> 01:42:19.743
MARISHA: Blue die. Okay! 21.

01:42:19.743 --> 01:42:28.759
MATT: You both (gulping)-- you finish just before,
slam the drinks down. (heavy exhaling)

01:42:28.759 --> 01:42:30.100
MARISHA: I'm not as tough as Beau.

01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:32.342
MATT: That's one victory on your end there. Roll
again.

01:42:35.472 --> 01:42:36.125
LIAM: Snap.

01:42:37.725 --> 01:42:39.785
MARISHA: Fuck. Seven.

01:42:41.845 --> 01:42:45.360
MATT: This time, she doesn't even break eye
contact with you. She tilts to the side (fast

01:42:45.374 --> 01:42:51.772
gulping), finishes it in seconds and slams it down
(heavy slam, belch) and burps in your direction

01:42:51.772 --> 01:42:56.208
while you're still drinking, and it catches you.
That's a loss on your end.

01:42:56.208 --> 01:42:57.362
TRAVIS: Burns your eyes a little bit.

01:42:57.362 --> 01:42:58.580
MATT: Yeah. Next one.

01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:01.616
TRAVIS: You got this.

01:43:01.616 --> 01:43:08.469
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. I'm going to let it
go, I'm going to let it live, 19. No, 20! No, 17,

01:43:08.469 --> 01:43:10.264
18, 19! I know math.

01:43:10.264 --> 01:43:14.540
MATT: Nice rolls! These are not saving throws,
right? This is the actual check.

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.414
MARISHA: Plus three.

01:43:15.414 --> 01:43:21.771
MATT: Got it. On that, as you both fill this next
set of tankards, you drink, and you finish just

01:43:21.771 --> 01:43:25.929
before she does. Both slam down, and she's
starting to have to tough into it. You can see her

01:43:25.929 --> 01:43:30.197
grinding her fingers into the woodwork. This is a
lot of drinking.

01:43:30.197 --> 01:43:33.131
MARISHA: I wipe the sweat off with my robe.

01:43:33.131 --> 01:43:36.746
MATT: That's two victories to you, one victory to
her. Fill up the next batch, the crowd's still

01:43:36.746 --> 01:43:40.057
shouting, "Beau! Beau! Beau!" Next roll.

01:43:42.857 --> 01:43:43.657
MARISHA: Nine.

01:43:43.657 --> 01:43:50.432
MATT: This time she toughs it in, she grabs with
both hands and chugs it down. The foam catches the

01:43:50.432 --> 01:43:54.557
corner of her mouth and she finishes it and she
wipes it off and sips it off her finger.

01:43:54.557 --> 01:43:55.356
TRAVIS: Brutal.

01:43:55.356 --> 01:43:58.929
MATT: That's a victory on her end. You guys are
both tied, the next roll's going to see who takes it.

01:43:59.852 --> 01:44:03.446
TRAVIS: Win or go home, Beau. Eye on the Cobalt
Soul, here we go!

01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:08.378
MATT: "Beau! Beau! Beau!" Her left eye's twitching
as she's glaring at you.

01:44:09.638 --> 01:44:12.953
MARISHA: All right, Gil. Comes down to you, boy.

01:44:12.953 --> 01:44:14.422
LIAM: Come on, Beauregard.

01:44:14.422 --> 01:44:15.431
MARISHA: Did she already roll?

01:44:15.431 --> 01:44:15.966
MATT: She did.

01:44:15.966 --> 01:44:21.751
MARISHA: (frustrated noise) Six. No, five.

01:44:21.751 --> 01:44:27.593
MATT: With that, you both chug, maintaining eye
contact. You get partway into it, and then

01:44:27.593 --> 01:44:34.620
(coughing and retching) and you begin backing up
into the tankard. You try and pass it off, and

01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:39.435
then as you drop the tankard to gather yourself,
(spitting) it sprays onto the table.

01:44:39.435 --> 01:44:40.478
MARISHA: Sorry!

01:44:40.478 --> 01:44:50.490
MATT: "Oh!" The whole crowd worked up for Beau's
victory falls into a series of sad awws. Ruth

01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:56.624
finishes her drink, sets it on the table and
(teeth sucking) turns around and goes back.

01:44:56.624 --> 01:45:00.464
TRAVIS: I'm sure we've got bread around here
somewhere, just find something to soak all of that up.

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.798
MARISHA: Ugh. Okay.

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:12.743
MATT: "Next up, we have Valkin!" You see now, this
very young-- looks like the runt of his family

01:45:12.743 --> 01:45:19.285
line of gnomes-- comes forward. Looks very thin,
bright-eyed, and very stark contrast to the rest

01:45:19.285 --> 01:45:25.086
of them, as he gets closer to the table and
sits down. "Who's my competitor?"

01:45:25.086 --> 01:45:26.845
LIAM: Ja hello, my name is Caleb.

01:45:27.098 --> 01:45:28.970
(laughter)

01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:30.532
MATT: Puts out a hand, "Caleb, it's a pleasure."

01:45:30.532 --> 01:45:31.554
LIAM: It's a pleasure.

01:45:31.554 --> 01:45:33.118
MATT: "Best of luck. May the best gnome win."

01:45:33.118 --> 01:45:36.189
LIAM: Let's enjoy a good game. Did you just say,
"May the best gnome win?"

01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.989
MATT: "Yes."

01:45:36.989 --> 01:45:39.039
SAM: He's trash talking! Don't listen to him!

01:45:39.039 --> 01:45:41.905
TRAVIS: Keep him out of your head!

01:45:41.905 --> 01:45:45.028
LIAM: I am a very skinny man. Let's do this.

01:45:45.028 --> 01:45:46.700
MARISHA: High metabolism. Use it!

01:45:48.450 --> 01:45:52.007
LIAM: Do not let me fall asleep face down in the
gutter tonight.

01:45:52.007 --> 01:45:53.093
LAURA: Won't happen.

01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:55.941
TALIESIN: That was an option?

01:45:55.941 --> 01:45:56.411
TRAVIS: For you.

01:45:56.411 --> 01:46:05.242
MATT: As you guys gather, the crowd begins to pull
in a bit. The evening mistress leans down at you

01:46:05.242 --> 01:46:10.943
and goes, "Don't worry lad. I can see you're
nervous, but just let the throat open and take it

01:46:10.943 --> 01:46:16.510
"in." Leans back, "And first batch, go!" Roll off.

01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:21.157
LIAM: Grog die! Yes! 21!

01:46:21.157 --> 01:46:30.064
MATT: Oh shit! Unexpectedly so, little Caleb finds
his taste for alcohol in this one, and with but a

01:46:30.064 --> 01:46:38.470
moment's notice, downs the entirety of his glass,
finishing it before Valkin does. Who says, "Oh,

01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:40.640
"well done. That's impressive."

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.851
LIAM: Yes, it's a good game. It's just a game.

01:46:42.851 --> 01:46:46.465
MATT: Fills both of them again. Next round, go for
it.

01:46:46.465 --> 01:46:47.455
TRAVIS: So polite.

01:46:47.455 --> 01:46:51.404
LIAM: (singing) Laurentia, liebe Laurentia mein.
Wann woll-

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:57.522
MATT: Your confidence overtakes you as you go into
the second round of cups, and you manage to

01:46:57.522 --> 01:47:01.578
finish, but you have to stop halfway through. You
have to actually go (heavy breathing) for the

01:47:01.578 --> 01:47:05.455
second serving. You take it down and finish it;
however, as you pull your glass down, you can see

01:47:05.455 --> 01:47:06.509
Valkin's there, leaning.

01:47:06.509 --> 01:47:09.206
LIAM: Enjoying the fumes. As they waft up again.

01:47:09.206 --> 01:47:10.994
MATT: "I can tell that. Well done, well done."

01:47:10.994 --> 01:47:13.471
SAM: Maybe we should do our dance to distract his
competitor now.

01:47:13.471 --> 01:47:14.863
LAURA: That's a good idea.

01:47:15.276 --> 01:47:16.510
MATT: Their drinks are filled. Go for it.

01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:19.082
LAURA: Directly in front of Valkin, we start--

01:47:19.622 --> 01:47:24.625
(laughter)

01:47:24.625 --> 01:47:27.848
MATT: Both of you guys make individual performance
checks.

01:47:32.258 --> 01:47:33.305
LAURA: 19!

01:47:33.305 --> 01:47:35.282
SAM: It was 15, but 12.

01:47:39.022 --> 01:47:42.602
MATT: He does not seem to be distracted,
unfortunately. What did you roll?

01:47:42.602 --> 01:47:43.571
LIAM: 13 for me.

01:47:43.571 --> 01:47:49.122
MATT: As you take a moment and (grunting and
huffing)--

01:47:49.122 --> 01:47:51.040
LIAM: Nighty Mein never says die!

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:58.506
MATT: You manage to finish the last bits of it,
and it takes a moment. You can feel all the suds

01:47:58.506 --> 01:48:03.166
of the mixtures of drinks you've had tonight
billowing in your stomach and churning. You hear

01:48:03.166 --> 01:48:07.997
the (gurgling) in your stomach. You're like, oh
that's not good. That's a second loss on your end.

01:48:07.997 --> 01:48:10.780
SAM: Oh no! No, Caleb, no!

01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:12.795
LIAM: I feel like it might go out the back exit
instead of the front.

01:48:13.211 --> 01:48:14.531
MATT: They fill it up. Next roll.

01:48:14.531 --> 01:48:15.968
LIAM: Aw! 14!

01:48:15.968 --> 01:48:24.823
MATT: 14? With this, you see Valkin-- he rolled a
nine, plus three, so you win this one. He goes and

01:48:24.823 --> 01:48:30.014
takes it, finishes it. You both, within a second
of each other, finish the drink and, "I got this.

01:48:30.014 --> 01:48:31.235
"You got this? I got this."

01:48:31.235 --> 01:48:32.514
TRAVIS: Caleb, steady.

01:48:32.514 --> 01:48:34.268
LIAM: I swat him on the side of the face.

01:48:34.268 --> 01:48:35.749
MATT: "No, don't! Don't touch."

01:48:35.749 --> 01:48:37.905
LIAM: I do it again. It's good!

01:48:37.905 --> 01:48:39.355
MATT: "Ah no! Don't do it please!"

01:48:39.355 --> 01:48:40.316
LIAM: It's good for you! Drink!

01:48:40.316 --> 01:48:42.252
MATT: Fill up the last batch. You guys both, final
roll.

01:48:42.252 --> 01:48:43.156
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:48:43.156 --> 01:48:49.069
(cheering)

01:48:49.069 --> 01:48:55.733
MATT: Natural 13 on his end. With that, he
finishes the drink and goes, "Told you! Boo yah!"

01:48:55.733 --> 01:49:03.504
Gets up from the table, turns around, and (thud)
faceplants right in the ground. Crowd goes, "Yeah!

01:49:03.504 --> 01:49:04.534
"Caleb!" Pick him up.

01:49:04.534 --> 01:49:07.759
LIAM: I nod, cooly, for a second, and I just turn
and go (spitting).

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:14.929
MATT: You pull your way away from the table.
Success is yours. That's now two victories on your

01:49:14.929 --> 01:49:23.790
end. One for Ruth there and two final competitors.
"Second to last competitor, the powerhouse, The

01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:31.828
"Walking Brick herself, Tanya!" This dwarven woman,
who looks like Rosie the Riveter on steroids,

01:49:31.828 --> 01:49:36.568
comes around the corner. She has her sleeves
rolled up past the deltoids. She has these massive

01:49:36.568 --> 01:49:41.139
hands with a bit of the dwarven hair gathered on
the outside of the forearm. Big, square jaw,

01:49:41.139 --> 01:49:46.196
missing the two front teeth, and she grins as she
sits down. She has most of her hair up and tied

01:49:46.196 --> 01:49:49.995
into this cloth. She got a bit of the coal smears
on her cheeks.

01:49:49.995 --> 01:49:53.910
MARISHA: Yeah Tanya! Woo!

01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:57.764
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll throw my leg over the chair and
sit down. Evening.

01:49:57.764 --> 01:49:58.747
SAM: All right, Fjord!

01:49:58.747 --> 01:50:00.785
MATT: "Ah. Evening to you."

01:50:00.785 --> 01:50:03.722
MARISHA: I like Tanya!

01:50:03.722 --> 01:50:07.045
TRAVIS: You ever done this before?

01:50:07.045 --> 01:50:10.470
MATT: "Oh, like all the time. You?"

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:12.239
TRAVIS: No.

01:50:12.239 --> 01:50:20.536
MATT: "Well, good luck then. I'm happy to see how
long you last, big boy. Fill it up!" They fill the

01:50:20.536 --> 01:50:22.347
drinks. Take your first swig there.

01:50:22.347 --> 01:50:24.098
TRAVIS: 16.

01:50:24.098 --> 01:50:30.949
MATT: You both finish neck and neck, but you still
manage to get it down faster. As you both stand

01:50:31.078 --> 01:50:37.126
there, she looks at you with a nod of being
impressed. "Not bad, not bad."

01:50:37.126 --> 01:50:38.759
TRAVIS: Is that all there is to this?

01:50:38.759 --> 01:50:39.889
MATT: "Oh, we've just gotten started."

01:50:39.889 --> 01:50:40.697
TRAVIS: Fill her up!

01:50:40.697 --> 01:50:42.546
MATT: "Fill her up!" Fill the next round.

01:50:42.546 --> 01:50:44.520
MARISHA: Nott, she said you were bad!

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.693
TRAVIS: 13.

01:50:46.693 --> 01:50:52.040
MATT: She beats you with a 16. As she goes ahead
and finishes off, sets it down and just waits for

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:57.447
you to finish, fingers crossed, and goes, "Cute,
cute. Not as strong as coming out of the gate. Is

01:50:57.447 --> 01:51:00.034
"that all you got? You going to lose the wind in
your sails there, green boy?"

01:51:00.034 --> 01:51:05.415
TRAVIS: I admit, I feel a little weak. I can't
tell if it's the drink or if it's your beautiful

01:51:05.415 --> 01:51:08.518
visage sitting in front of me.

01:51:08.881 --> 01:51:11.777
MATT: You hear this voice go, "Ah, ey ey! He's
mine."

01:51:11.777 --> 01:51:15.459
TRAVIS: Shit. Fill her up.

01:51:15.459 --> 01:51:16.910
MATT: They fill up the two drinks.

01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:21.377
LAURA: I want to cast Mirror Image on myself in
front of... her. What's her name?

01:51:21.377 --> 01:51:22.107
SAM: Tanya.

01:51:22.107 --> 01:51:26.673
LAURA: Tanya, and wiggle to make it look like her
vision's starting to double.

01:51:26.673 --> 01:51:29.931
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:38.296
LAURA: Oh no, that's bad. Yeah, that was the goal.
Eight!

01:51:38.296 --> 01:51:43.146
MATT: Eight. You manage to do so. She doesn't seem
to be paying attention to you. Caleb, you're

01:51:43.146 --> 01:51:46.622
getting really nauseous watching Jester do this
little dance off to the side.

01:51:46.622 --> 01:51:49.363
LAURA: Whoa-oa-oa.

01:51:49.623 --> 01:51:51.943
MATT: Make your roll.

01:51:52.544 --> 01:51:54.800
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:58.101
MATT: No shit! Okay!

01:51:58.101 --> 01:52:00.229
LIAM: That is one smooth seaman.

01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:06.038
MATT: That's two victories to you, one victory to
her. With that one, you finish it abruptly, slam

01:52:06.038 --> 01:52:09.012
it down, and you're like oh, you're actually
gaining a round. That weird swirling in your

01:52:09.012 --> 01:52:13.525
stomach has faded and you've come into your own in
this game. She's looking-- you see the sweat

01:52:13.525 --> 01:52:18.139
appearing on her brow. She's like, "That's okay.
There's more where that came from! Fill it up! I

01:52:18.139 --> 01:52:20.774
"got his number, come on!" Make a roll off.

01:52:22.754 --> 01:52:24.411
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:52:24.411 --> 01:52:26.013
MATT: What the shit!

01:52:27.614 --> 01:52:29.633
MARISHA: Fucking champ!

01:52:29.633 --> 01:52:31.526
TALIESIN: Eye contact never broken!

01:52:31.526 --> 01:52:42.294
MATT: And with that, Tanya goes down. She gets
halfway through the drink before, "No. Sorry," and

01:52:42.294 --> 01:52:45.594
looks back towards Ol' Blemmy before she leans
forward and stumbles out of the chair. One of the

01:52:45.594 --> 01:52:48.818
other people picks her up and pulls her to the
side, and Ol' Blemmy's just sitting there, fuming.

01:52:48.818 --> 01:52:51.726
TRAVIS: Never get into a drinking game with a man
of the sea.

01:52:51.726 --> 01:52:56.795
MATT: She goes, "And with that, it looks like Ol'
Blemmy's team has fallen! That's three victories-- "

01:52:56.795 --> 01:53:05.803
at which, Ol' Blemmy puts up a hand and goes,
"Not yet! I haven't competed. One of theirs hasn't

01:53:05.803 --> 01:53:13.844
"competed. How 'bout we make a deal? Last fight:
double or nothing."

01:53:13.844 --> 01:53:17.107
LAURA: Wait, we can win money from this thing?

01:53:17.107 --> 01:53:18.659
SAM: It was always about money.

01:53:18.659 --> 01:53:22.643
LAURA: I thought we only got tokens or something
for free drinks.

01:53:22.643 --> 01:53:27.506
TRAVIS: Nah, we win money. There's money in it. I
like it. I say we go for it.

01:53:27.506 --> 01:53:33.784
LIAM: I like it as well, but only if you can match
this diamond worth, oh... about 100 gold.

01:53:33.784 --> 01:53:37.655
TRAVIS: Are you putting in the f-- well.

01:53:37.655 --> 01:53:41.685
LIAM: Give me something like that or there's no
deal.

01:53:42.872 --> 01:53:47.545
MATT: They look at each other going, "I think
that's a little rich for our tastes."

01:53:47.545 --> 01:53:48.648
LIAM: Oh.

01:53:48.648 --> 01:53:53.865
LAURA: Aw, no, fuck it! Let's just do it without
that deal! Double or nothing! Go Nott! Yeah!

01:53:53.865 --> 01:53:56.644
SAM: She's the worst negotiator ever!

01:53:56.644 --> 01:54:00.556
TALIESIN: This is such a change of pace from last
year. It's so exciting.

01:54:00.556 --> 01:54:05.482
LAURA: All my mirror images are like, yeah!
Drink!

01:54:05.482 --> 01:54:07.547
MATT: "Who's going to come after me then?"

01:54:07.547 --> 01:54:08.729
SAM: I'm scared.

01:54:08.729 --> 01:54:10.098
LAURA: You've got it Nott!

01:54:10.098 --> 01:54:13.199
SAM: All right. I've looked in the-- by the way,
Matt-- I've looked in the thing. The--

01:54:13.199 --> 01:54:15.535
TRAVIS: The dodecahedron.

01:54:15.535 --> 01:54:16.728
SAM: The dodecahedron.

01:54:16.728 --> 01:54:17.578
MATT: Okay.

01:54:17.578 --> 01:54:20.883
SAM: All right, I'll try. Hello, sir.

01:54:20.883 --> 01:54:25.051
MATT: "This? This is what you bring before me as
an offering?"

01:54:25.051 --> 01:54:32.495
TRAVIS: You know, she's called the Bottomless Pit.
(hiccups)

01:54:32.495 --> 01:54:36.558
MATT: "I'm going to crush you, little green one."

01:54:36.558 --> 01:54:40.281
MARISHA: Fuck his shit up, Nott! Fuck his shit
up!

01:54:40.281 --> 01:54:41.533
SAM: All right, I'll try!

01:54:41.533 --> 01:54:42.615
LAURA: Are you under Disguise Self?

01:54:42.615 --> 01:54:43.432
SAM: No!

01:54:43.432 --> 01:54:47.918
MATT: It's great. When he talks, you see the
bristles of the beard-- You can see as the evening

01:54:47.918 --> 01:54:52.080
mistress up at the top goes, "All right! Looks
like we're going to get to see Ol' Blemmy strain

01:54:52.776 --> 01:54:58.357
"through his baleen after all! Get to the sides of
the table. Let The Whale take a drink."

01:54:58.357 --> 01:55:00.167
MARISHA and TRAVIS: The Whale?!

01:55:00.167 --> 01:55:01.520
MARISHA: Oh shit!

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:02.606
SAM: I don't have this.

01:55:02.606 --> 01:55:03.758
TRAVIS: You already have this!

01:55:03.758 --> 01:55:06.826
MARISHA: Bottomless pit!

01:55:06.826 --> 01:55:12.951
MATT: The dwarf sits down. His mitt completely
encompasses the tankard with his giant dwarven

01:55:12.951 --> 01:55:17.787
hand. "Against Ol' Blemmy we have?"

01:55:17.787 --> 01:55:22.829
SAM: (stammering) Hello. I'm Otto.

01:55:26.329 --> 01:55:27.307
MATT: "Otto!"

01:55:28.846 --> 01:55:31.427
LAURA: Woo!

01:55:31.427 --> 01:55:32.621
SAM: Sorry.

01:55:32.621 --> 01:55:34.230
TRAVIS: Otto the Bottomless Pit!

01:55:34.230 --> 01:55:35.489
SAM: Yes.

01:55:35.489 --> 01:55:38.200
MATT: "And drink!" Pours the drinks, make a roll.

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:43.457
SAM: It's a five.

01:55:43.457 --> 01:55:45.028
LIAM: You could use it now?

01:55:45.028 --> 01:55:46.698
MATT: Are you going to go with it?

01:55:46.698 --> 01:55:50.897
SAM: Yeah, I'll use it now! Okay, that's better.
That's 17.

01:55:50.897 --> 01:55:57.756
MATT: 17? You both chug down. You manage to finish
quickly, slam it down. Oh, this isn't as bad as

01:55:57.756 --> 01:56:02.723
you thought. You've have much harder liquors than
this. The froth is filling at the edges of his

01:56:02.723 --> 01:56:08.380
mustache and as he pulls it down, there's a
coating of foam from the drink resting there. A

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:15.504
tongue comes out of nowhere, this Cousin Itt
broom-like beard, the tongue takes the suds in.

01:56:15.504 --> 01:56:17.152
That was a victory on your end.

01:56:17.152 --> 01:56:20.143
SAM: I feel good. This feels right.

01:56:20.143 --> 01:56:22.560
TRAVIS: Otto!

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.156
LIAM: Get it, von Bismarck!

01:56:24.156 --> 01:56:26.297
MATT: Next batch. Make the roll.

01:56:26.297 --> 01:56:34.556
SAM: I take out a bit of fleece and rub it and
cast Silent Image on myself, to make a pussy eye,

01:56:34.556 --> 01:56:42.472
something real gross that looks real disgusting.
That's an 18.

01:56:42.472 --> 01:56:49.080
MATT: 18? That's pretty damn good. Ol' Blemmy
finishes his drink. That's two for two victories

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:56.800
on your end there. He's not had the best luck
rolling these last two rounds. He finishes it

01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:06.433
down, "You're small, but I can see why they call
you the Bottomless Pit."

01:57:06.433 --> 01:57:08.368
MARISHA: Yeah, BP!

01:57:11.326 --> 01:57:18.779
MATT: He grabs the barrel from the person and
fills his own last tankard, hands it off. "Let's

01:57:18.779 --> 01:57:21.821
"go." Take the roll.

01:57:22.088 --> 01:57:28.624
SAM: Can I drink this with Mage Hand pouring from
way up there?

01:57:28.624 --> 01:57:29.937
MATT: If you really want to, sure.

01:57:29.937 --> 01:57:31.097
SAM: I do.

01:57:31.097 --> 01:57:36.270
MATT: So you're like, "Ah!" catching it
underneath. The crowds like, "Yeah!" clamoring. Go

01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:38.321
ahead and make your roll.

01:57:38.321 --> 01:57:40.618
SAM: Only 14.

01:57:40.618 --> 01:57:44.282
MATT: As it's coming down, it's splashing on your
face a bit. You're trying to catch it all.

01:57:44.282 --> 01:57:46.017
SAM: I got too cocky!

01:57:46.017 --> 01:57:51.963
MATT: You manage to catch most of it and you
finish it. You realize that the liquors that

01:57:51.963 --> 01:57:55.039
you've been having are not been mixing well with
this particular drink. You're starting to feel--

01:57:55.039 --> 01:57:57.418
oof. That's a victory on his end.

01:57:57.418 --> 01:57:59.309
SAM: Oh no!

01:57:59.309 --> 01:58:04.633
MATT: All you hear is this subtle (chuckling).
Roll for the next one.

01:58:04.633 --> 01:58:06.840
SAM: I don't think I can do it!

01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:10.391
TRAVIS: Jester cut him! He can't see you out
there, cut him!

01:58:10.391 --> 01:58:12.740
SAM: Cut my eyes! Cut my eyelids off!

01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:18.450
LAURA: What? No! You got this, Nott! I'm going to
cast Bless.

01:58:18.450 --> 01:58:20.078
SAM: Oh, what does that do?

01:58:20.078 --> 01:58:26.502
LAURA: I think it gives you advantage on saving
throws. Is this a saving throw?

01:58:26.502 --> 01:58:29.766
MATT: No, but you're blessed.

01:58:29.766 --> 01:58:32.098
LAURA: But I cast it on you!

01:58:32.098 --> 01:58:33.922
MATT: All right, make your roll.

01:58:33.922 --> 01:58:36.125
SAM: That's a 21.

01:58:36.681 --> 01:58:41.693
MATT: He rolled a natural 16 with a plus four
modifier, that puts him at 20.

01:58:41.693 --> 01:58:46.181
(cheering)

01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:50.005
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (chanting) Break the tank!
Break the tank!

01:58:53.373 --> 01:59:02.353
MATT: As you both finish the drink, everyone is
like, "Yeah! Oh--" The whole crowd backs up for a minute.

01:59:02.353 --> 01:59:03.978
TRAVIS: Nott!

01:59:03.978 --> 01:59:05.106
SAM: Sorry.

01:59:05.106 --> 01:59:18.593
MATT: Ol' Blemmy leans forward and goes, "Wait a
minute. Are you a fucking green--" and passes out

01:59:18.593 --> 01:59:24.698
on the table, the saliva pools before him. The
crowd goes wild!

01:59:24.698 --> 01:59:27.463
(cheering)

01:59:27.463 --> 01:59:32.290
MATT: Irena leans does and fiddles through his
pockets and pulls out his token. He goes, "I do

01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:34.943
"believe that you've earned this!"

01:59:34.943 --> 01:59:37.121
SAM: Thank you.

01:59:37.121 --> 01:59:39.407
MARISHA: (drunkenly) And we get our names on the
board!

01:59:39.623 --> 01:59:41.011
SAM: What does this get me?

01:59:41.011 --> 01:59:44.303
MATT: "Oh, it get you free drinks here for the
rest of the week. Or until someone takes it from you.

01:59:44.303 --> 01:59:45.957
TRAVIS: Free drinks?

01:59:45.957 --> 01:59:47.398
SAM: Guys, we can drink more!

01:59:47.398 --> 01:59:48.803
MARISHA: (drunkenly) Yeah.

01:59:48.803 --> 01:59:50.204
TRAVIS: (drunkenly) Yep.

01:59:50.204 --> 01:59:51.696
LAURA: You guys look like shit.

01:59:51.696 --> 01:59:54.740
LIAM: There's three of you.

01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:56.972
LAURA: There are, yes.

01:59:56.972 --> 01:59:58.154
MARISHA: My mouth is watering.

01:59:58.154 --> 02:00:03.227
SAM: Let it be known that The Mighty Nein can take
on any competitor and win! Victory will be

02:00:03.227 --> 02:00:06.105
ours in any arena!

02:00:06.105 --> 02:00:11.864
MATT: "Yeah!" Cheers go up there. Already, there's
somebody off in the corner who's whittling a block

02:00:11.864 --> 02:00:15.465
of wood and carving "The Mighty Nein" into it to
put on the wall. The rest of Ol' Blemmy's team

02:00:15.465 --> 02:00:19.663
begrudgingly come up and drunkenly pass forward
their tokens and pass them over to you. You have

02:00:19.663 --> 02:00:22.840
five drink tokens. Five of you can drink for free
at this bar.

02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:24.598
SAM: Well worth it.

02:00:24.598 --> 02:00:26.991
LAURA: Is there money involved here?

02:00:26.991 --> 02:00:30.985
MATT: It was double or nothing, so that's 60 gold.
They end up having to pony up the rest of it.

02:00:30.985 --> 02:00:35.925
There's a 20% cut for the house though, so that's
60 gold, losing 20% of that.

02:00:35.925 --> 02:00:38.418
TALIESIN: I'll take 20 of that because I put in--

02:00:38.418 --> 02:00:41.247
MATT: That's 48 gold go back to you guys.

02:00:41.247 --> 02:00:43.174
LAURA: I take five because I gave Molly five.

02:00:43.174 --> 02:00:48.779
MATT: Okay. Everyone claps you on the back and
starts cheering and shaking your hands and stuff.

02:00:48.779 --> 02:00:51.033
"Oh, that was amazing!"

02:00:51.033 --> 02:00:55.521
TRAVIS: Tell me you have biscuits and gravy or
something.

02:00:55.521 --> 02:00:57.585
MATT: "We will in the morning."

02:00:57.585 --> 02:00:59.047
TALIESIN: Oh, that will be perfect.

02:00:59.047 --> 02:01:01.941
MATT: "Well, if you're looking for a meal-- "

02:01:01.941 --> 02:01:04.825
SAM: Oh yeah!

02:01:04.825 --> 02:01:08.821
MARISHA: She wants to fuck your brains out.

02:01:08.821 --> 02:01:13.569
TRAVIS: You know, I think I have some more
libations in me.

02:01:13.569 --> 02:01:17.410
SAM: Fjord, why not? We're in Hupperdook. Dook it
up!

02:01:17.410 --> 02:01:19.672
TRAVIS: I know. The night is young! It's young!

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:21.508
TALIESIN: I can crash in another room. It's
perfectly fine.

02:01:21.508 --> 02:01:22.751
TRAVIS: It's young, Molly!

02:01:22.751 --> 02:01:23.739
LAURA: We do have an extra room.

02:01:23.739 --> 02:01:24.773
TRAVIS: No, it's fine!

02:01:24.773 --> 02:01:25.900
MARISHA: He's too drunk to fuck.

02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:29.551
TRAVIS: Well, that's not true. I'm fine.

02:01:29.551 --> 02:01:34.593
MARISHA: He's a little embarrassed. His penis gets
a little limp after a few drinks.

02:01:34.593 --> 02:01:36.250
TRAVIS: Wow. Not at all.

02:01:36.250 --> 02:01:37.501
MARISHA: It's nothing personal.

02:01:37.501 --> 02:01:39.507
TRAVIS: She doesn't know me like that. It's not
real.

02:01:39.507 --> 02:01:42.000
MATT: "I have a friend who's an herbalist who has
something could help with that."

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.775
TALIESIN: You have a friend who's an herbalist?

02:01:44.775 --> 02:01:48.336
MARISHA: Do you have a topical cream? Nevermind,
that's a different problem.

02:01:48.336 --> 02:01:50.058
TRAVIS: Where's your pisser?

02:01:50.058 --> 02:01:54.871
MATT: "Oh! It's up, third floor. There's a bit of
a water closet. Just aim for the hole, please."

02:01:54.871 --> 02:01:57.246
TRAVIS: I'll be right back. I go.

02:01:57.246 --> 02:02:00.603
MARISHA: It's his penis problem again. What?!

02:02:00.603 --> 02:02:01.987
MATT: You guys are trashed.

02:02:01.987 --> 02:02:07.465
LIAM: You-- you are very-- you are-- you are very
drunk.

02:02:07.465 --> 02:02:09.720
MARISHA: That's very observant.

02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:13.511
LIAM: Am I also very drunk?

02:02:13.511 --> 02:02:16.198
MARISHA: Can you feel this? Slap!

02:02:16.198 --> 02:02:20.913
LIAM: I assume I take one hit point of damage. Or
1d4, from a monk.

02:02:20.913 --> 02:02:22.476
MATT: I'd say you take a hit point.

02:02:22.476 --> 02:02:24.065
LIAM: Okay.

02:02:24.065 --> 02:02:26.359
TRAVIS: You're drunk. You're real relaxed.

02:02:26.359 --> 02:02:30.037
MARISHA: Did you feel that? My hands are stinging
now.

02:02:30.037 --> 02:02:33.399
LIAM: (singing) Oh, The Mighty Nein is The Mighty
Nein. The Mighty Nein is The Mighty Nein. The

02:02:33.399 --> 02:02:35.830
mightiest nine that ever neined!

02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:37.303
SAM: I like that song!

02:02:37.303 --> 02:02:40.988
LIAM: (singing) Nine mighties, mighties nine!

02:02:40.988 --> 02:02:43.651
LAURA: Do you guys need to go to bed or
something?

02:02:43.651 --> 02:02:45.034
MARISHA: I think I'm going to puke.

02:02:45.034 --> 02:02:47.735
SAM: I'm totally fine.

02:02:47.735 --> 02:02:49.683
LAURA: You sound pretty normal, actually, Nott.

02:02:49.683 --> 02:02:50.515
SAM: This is great.

02:02:50.515 --> 02:02:54.714
MATT: Nott, you are intoxicated. You are
fearless.

02:02:54.714 --> 02:02:56.224
LIAM: I thought we were going dancing.

02:02:56.224 --> 02:02:57.062
SAM: I can do anything!

02:02:57.062 --> 02:02:58.457
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

02:02:58.457 --> 02:03:00.246
SAM: I can surf on a truck!

02:03:00.246 --> 02:03:04.256
(laughter)

02:03:04.256 --> 02:03:08.228
MARISHA: Give me five minutes. I'm going to go
out. I'm going to go behind the alley. I'm going

02:03:08.228 --> 02:03:12.627
to barf. I'm going to clean myself up, and then
I'm going to go back in a little bit more put together.

02:03:12.775 --> 02:03:14.754
TRAVIS: Puke and rally!

02:03:14.754 --> 02:03:15.779
MARISHA: Yep!

02:03:15.779 --> 02:03:17.608
LAURA: I'm going to ask Caleb to waltz with me.

02:03:18.096 --> 02:03:20.907
LIAM: Okay.

02:03:20.907 --> 02:03:24.349
TALIESIN: Nott, I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud
of you! So well done!

02:03:24.349 --> 02:03:26.118
SAM: You were great out there.

02:03:26.118 --> 02:03:30.555
MATT: In the midst of everything dying down,
people are starting to get pretty sloshed, and the

02:03:30.555 --> 02:03:37.978
energy level, while still rather rowdy, some folks
are starting to tap out for the night. Jester

02:03:37.978 --> 02:03:44.487
drags Caleb into the center of the tavern floor,
takes hands, and Caleb, almost running out on

02:03:44.487 --> 02:03:48.695
autopilot, who does have some minor experience in
the past. Go ahead and make a performance check

02:03:48.695 --> 02:03:51.283
with disadvantage, Caleb.

02:03:51.283 --> 02:03:56.032
LIAM: That's cocked. That's okay. With advantage,
you say?

02:03:56.032 --> 02:03:58.029
MATT: Disadvantage, because you're drunk.

02:03:58.029 --> 02:04:01.932
LIAM: That's very low. Very low. That is a five.

02:04:01.932 --> 02:04:09.455
MATT: Caleb, a moment passes before Jester begins
leading you, but you guys continue, the two of

02:04:09.455 --> 02:04:15.795
you, to have a very nice little waltz in the
middle of the area. Quietly, the music begins to

02:04:15.795 --> 02:04:21.146
change. What was once the rowdy bar music
transitions into an actual waltz piece as the

02:04:21.146 --> 02:04:28.807
musicians notice this happening. The three fourths
begins to pick up. One two three, one two three.

02:04:28.807 --> 02:04:34.052
As you guys continue to dance, a few other couples
begin to get up and start faking it. They don't

02:04:34.052 --> 02:04:38.745
seem to know, but they're watching, playfully
making up their own waltz-type maneuver. An

02:04:38.745 --> 02:04:43.075
impromptu, half-assed waltz begins to develop here
in the center of the tavern.

02:04:43.075 --> 02:04:43.914
SAM: Mollymauk?

02:04:43.914 --> 02:04:45.385
TALIESIN: I'm in!

02:04:45.385 --> 02:04:47.790
SAM: We'll dance a bit.

02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:51.657
MATT: You guys begin to join this as well. Which
one of you is leading?

02:04:51.657 --> 02:04:52.556
TALIESIN: I'll lead.

02:04:52.556 --> 02:04:53.763
SAM: Absolutely!

02:04:53.763 --> 02:04:58.847
MATT: Molly's leading. Nott's at his beck and call
as you guys begin to dance around in a circle.

02:04:58.847 --> 02:05:01.727
Beau and Fjord, you're drunkenly staring at this.

02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:03.860
TRAVIS: I actually did not come back down.

02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:06.985
MATT: Oh, that's right. You're still upstairs.
Fjord is passed the fuck out upstairs.

02:05:06.985 --> 02:05:11.331
TRAVIS: I might have passed out in the pisser.

02:05:11.331 --> 02:05:21.540
LIAM: Out there dancing: You were always a better
dancer than me, Astrid. You were always so good.

02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.203
LAURA: Astrid?

02:05:23.203 --> 02:05:24.669
LIAM: Ja.

02:05:24.669 --> 02:05:28.012
LAURA: Oh, well, you know, Caleb--

02:05:28.012 --> 02:05:33.131
LIAM: I break away. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:05:33.131 --> 02:05:37.295
LAURA: Caleb, do you need to go to sleep?

02:05:37.295 --> 02:05:40.474
LIAM: I stumble away.

02:05:40.474 --> 02:05:44.681
LAURA: No, no, no! I grab his jacket.

02:05:44.681 --> 02:05:46.020
SAM: Yes, you're way stronger!

02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:50.859
LAURA: You are not going to go pass out in the
street. You told me to be in charge of this. I

02:05:50.859 --> 02:05:55.131
walk him upstairs and makes sure he gets in bed.

02:05:55.131 --> 02:06:00.081
MATT: Jester goes and tucks Caleb into one of the
rooms, in bed comfortably.

02:06:00.081 --> 02:06:03.937
LIAM: You are blue.

02:06:03.937 --> 02:06:09.304
LAURA: Yes, I am, and you are very nice and a
little stinky.

02:06:09.304 --> 02:06:16.393
LIAM: (singing) One of those things is true, and
you are blue.

02:06:16.393 --> 02:06:26.233
LAURA: I'm sure Astrid loves you very much. I tuck
him in.

02:06:26.233 --> 02:06:28.797
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab Beau before we head
up.

02:06:28.797 --> 02:06:34.104
MARISHA: I'm coming in the door. Let's keep going!
What?

02:06:34.104 --> 02:06:38.444
TALIESIN: Is it all right if I try something? No,
nothing like that. I just wanted--

02:06:38.444 --> 02:06:40.884
MARISHA: I will fucking punch you if you try and
kiss me.

02:06:40.884 --> 02:06:42.442
TALIESIN: Oh god!

02:06:42.442 --> 02:06:44.971
MARISHA: I know I'm attractive.

02:06:44.971 --> 02:06:52.527
TALIESIN: How is your hangover? Whatever team your
on, I'm not sure I play for that one. It's Team

02:06:52.527 --> 02:06:58.538
"fuck off," I'm well aware. How are your hangovers
normally?

02:06:58.538 --> 02:07:03.172
MARISHA: Normally, I'll wake up and I sweat it
out.

02:07:03.172 --> 02:07:08.563
TALIESIN: I got a weird thought. This may feel
weird. I'm going to try my blood maledict.

02:07:08.563 --> 02:07:10.211
MARISHA: What?

02:07:10.211 --> 02:07:24.182
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the Purgation advanced
to see if I can cure a hangover with it. I don't

02:07:24.182 --> 02:07:29.042
know if it will work. Technically, it's a poison,
and I'm willing to drop some HP into this. It gets

02:07:29.042 --> 02:07:34.048
a little fancy and it's mostly to see if I can
clean it up a little bit. Maybe it'll work, maybe it won't.

02:07:34.384 --> 02:07:35.386
MATT: Are you going to amplify it or not?

02:07:35.386 --> 02:07:37.453
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. I want to see if it works.

02:07:37.453 --> 02:07:39.605
MARISHA: I'm a hot mess and I like it!

02:07:39.605 --> 02:07:41.840
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw, Beau.

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:42.808
MARISHA: Saving throw?

02:07:42.808 --> 02:07:44.611
MATT: Yes.

02:07:45.948 --> 02:07:47.689
MARISHA: God, this one does this every time.

02:07:47.689 --> 02:07:49.306
TRAVIS: It's a fucking tease.

02:07:49.306 --> 02:07:52.005
MARISHA: It's kind of a dick. Six.

02:07:52.005 --> 02:07:58.794
MATT: You manage to sober her up a little bit, but
you're still pretty tipsy. From going blackout

02:07:58.794 --> 02:08:05.231
drunk, you're now heavily buzzed and right at
drunk.

02:08:05.231 --> 02:08:08.054
TALIESIN: I feel like this could be very useful.
I'm going to work on this.

02:08:08.054 --> 02:08:13.223
MATT: What's interesting is, as you finish this,
out of some of the pores, the actual alcohol is

02:08:13.223 --> 02:08:17.323
drawn out, hovers in the air for a second before
dropping on the ground.

02:08:17.323 --> 02:08:21.498
MARISHA: No! No, that was a party foul!

02:08:21.498 --> 02:08:24.817
TALIESIN: I wouldn't touch that!

02:08:24.817 --> 02:08:34.560
MARISHA: Was that inside of me? Did you touch
inside me? Oh, fuck.

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:40.077
TALIESIN: Thank you for being part of my little
experiment.

02:08:40.077 --> 02:08:41.482
MARISHA: All right, now what?

02:08:41.482 --> 02:08:52.694
TALIESIN: I was just curious if I could pull
liquor out of people. I'm going to go throw up on

02:08:52.694 --> 02:08:54.667
Fjord, excuse me.

02:08:54.667 --> 02:09:01.300
MATT: Oh, no!

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:05.446
TALIESIN: I'm going to find Fjord and make sure
that however I throw up, it makes it so it looks

02:09:05.446 --> 02:09:06.951
like he did it to himself.

02:09:06.951 --> 02:09:10.646
(groaning)

02:09:10.646 --> 02:09:12.720
MATT: No! Not like that!

02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:19.530
LAURA and MATT: Not like this.

02:09:19.530 --> 02:09:21.396
MATT: Do you leave Fjord in the bathroom?

02:09:21.396 --> 02:09:23.163
TALIESIN: Oh, god no. I bring him back in.

02:09:23.163 --> 02:09:29.144
MATT: Okay. You guys all make yourselves back to
your rooms. As you check inside, Yasha is asleep

02:09:29.144 --> 02:09:34.787
in a corner, there with her sword at the side,
ready. Curled up against her chest is Kiri, also

02:09:34.787 --> 02:09:39.495
asleep, bundled up, a little bustle of feathers.

02:09:39.495 --> 02:09:41.996
LAURA: She tried to shave her.

02:09:44.027 --> 02:09:51.434
MATT: You guys eventually find yourselves to rest
for the night, sleep. Long arduous morning comes

02:09:51.434 --> 02:09:59.946
to, as the sun comes up through the windows. The
sound of distant, wandering roosters crowing at

02:09:59.946 --> 02:10:08.783
daybreak break you into consciousness. The
hangovers are real. Beau's doing okay. There's a

02:10:08.783 --> 02:10:13.239
little bit of a hangover, but not too bad.
Jester's totally sober. Yasha's sober.

02:10:13.239 --> 02:10:16.227
LAURA: Sober! I'm doing ribbon dances in the
bedroom.

02:10:16.227 --> 02:10:19.407
TALIESIN: Fuck off.

02:10:19.407 --> 02:10:26.573
MATT: Jester, as you and Beau start to get ready,
you guys start gathering your things. Beau, your

02:10:26.573 --> 02:10:28.972
coin purse is missing.

02:10:28.972 --> 02:10:30.977
(gasping)

02:10:30.977 --> 02:10:44.300
MARISHA: Motherfucker. Who did it? Jester! My
coi-- fuck. Fuck, I'm still hungover! Goddamn it!

02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:45.497
LAURA: What?

02:10:45.497 --> 02:10:46.674
MARISHA: My coin purse is missing!

02:10:46.674 --> 02:10:47.945
SAM: Her koi pond!

02:10:47.945 --> 02:10:49.629
MARISHA: My koi pond!

02:10:49.629 --> 02:10:53.328
LAURA: Your money is gone? Is my money still on
me?

02:10:53.328 --> 02:10:54.545
MATT: You still have your money on you.

02:10:54.545 --> 02:10:56.293
LAURA: I still have my money. What happened to
yours?

02:10:56.293 --> 02:10:59.071
MARISHA: Motherfucker, there was 300 gold in
there!

02:10:59.071 --> 02:11:07.768
LAURA: You should really spread it out, Beau!
That's really not good! Should we go looking for

02:11:07.768 --> 02:11:11.869
it? Maybe you dropped it under the bed. Can I
start looking around the room?

02:11:11.869 --> 02:11:14.583
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:11:15.806 --> 02:11:18.098
MARISHA: Someone's going to fucking die.

02:11:19.532 --> 02:11:20.934
LAURA: 16.

02:11:20.934 --> 02:11:24.376
MATT: You spend a few moments looking around, and
it's nowhere to be seen in the room.

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:26.941
LAURA: I think somebody might have taken it from
you.

02:11:26.941 --> 02:11:30.720
MARISHA: Yeah, I think that's exactly what
happened.

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:37.842
LAURA: Oh no. I wonder if that's a common thing
when people get drunk like that.

02:11:37.842 --> 02:11:40.661
MARISHA: We're going to go talk to Irene right
now. I bet she knows the motherfucker. We're going

02:11:40.661 --> 02:11:41.969
to fucking track him down.

02:11:41.969 --> 02:11:42.971
LAURA: Irena?

02:11:42.971 --> 02:11:46.203
MARISHA: Whatever that bitch's name is. Let's go!

02:11:46.836 --> 02:11:48.226
MATT: All right, is everybody else waking up?

02:11:48.226 --> 02:11:49.165
SAM: Sure.

02:11:49.165 --> 02:11:52.637
LAURA: Hey! I knock on the doors really loud.
Check your coin purses!

02:11:52.637 --> 02:11:54.453
(groaning)

02:11:54.453 --> 02:11:56.490
LAURA: Make sure you have your money still!

02:11:56.490 --> 02:11:57.777
TRAVIS: What's wrong with you?

02:11:57.777 --> 02:11:59.197
SAM: Do we have our money?

02:11:59.197 --> 02:12:00.334
MATT: No.

02:12:00.334 --> 02:12:02.052
SAM: Wait, all of our money is gone?

02:12:02.052 --> 02:12:07.237
MATT: Nott, Molly, Fjord, your coin purses are
gone, and we're going to take a break!

02:12:07.237 --> 02:12:11.854
TRAVIS: You!

02:12:12.611 --> 02:12:20.544
MARISHA: I lied; I had way more in there than
that. We just got fucking-- (exhales deeply)

02:12:20.544 --> 02:12:22.537
TRAVIS: That's a lot of money.

02:12:22.537 --> 02:12:24.777
TALIESIN: That's a lot of money.

02:12:24.777 --> 02:12:26.629
LAURA: What about Caleb? Does Caleb have his
money?

02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:29.310
TRAVIS: (screaming)

02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:30.860
MARISHA: All two gold?

02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:34.696
LIAM: All five of my gold. Do I have my
motherfucking books?

02:12:34.696 --> 02:12:35.636
MATT: Your books are still with you.

02:12:35.636 --> 02:12:37.112
LAURA: What about your diamond?

02:12:37.112 --> 02:12:41.443
MATT: Your diamond you keep with your components.
That wasn't missing. It was just the coin purse missing.

02:12:41.443 --> 02:12:44.124
MARISHA: All right guys, here's the deal--

02:12:44.124 --> 02:12:45.341
LAURA and MATT: We're taking a break.

02:12:45.341 --> 02:12:49.045
MARISHA: No, fuck! I'm so angry! Fuck!

02:12:49.045 --> 02:12:50.235
MATT: Hold it!

02:12:50.235 --> 02:12:54.048
(laughter)

02:12:54.048 --> 02:13:00.563
MATT: I love that woman. All right, guys, we'll be
back here in a few minutes. Stay tuned for the

02:13:00.563 --> 02:13:06.999
break. We have Jason Charles Miller's video about
his awesome album. Check it out, and we'll see you

02:13:06.999 --> 02:13:09.648
here in a few minutes.

02:13:09.842 --> 02:13:15.518
MATT: And welcome back. Returning to where we
were, The Mighty Nein, coming to consciousness,

02:13:15.518 --> 02:13:22.529
most of them with a roaring hangover, have come to
realize that all of their money has been pilfered.

02:13:22.529 --> 02:13:29.255
Other than Jester and Yasha, everyone else appears
to, at some point during the evening, lost their

02:13:29.255 --> 02:13:36.686
monetary gains. As you guys are finding this out,
what do you do?

02:13:36.686 --> 02:13:40.839
SAM: I accuse Jester of stealing our money!

02:13:40.839 --> 02:13:42.972
LAURA: Me? Why would I steal your money?

02:13:42.972 --> 02:13:43.924
SAM: You're right. It's stupid.

02:13:43.924 --> 02:13:45.177
LAURA: That is really dumb.

02:13:45.177 --> 02:13:53.824
SAM: We, as detectives, should think clearly about
this and figure out: when was the money stolen?

02:13:53.824 --> 02:13:58.496
Did you all have your money after the competition?

02:13:58.496 --> 02:14:01.314
MARISHA: Yeah, we put our winnings-- we split it
up and threw it in the pack.

02:14:01.314 --> 02:14:05.067
SAM: Between the competition and bedtime, our
money was stolen.

02:14:05.067 --> 02:14:10.729
LAURA: So it had to be somebody that seems
inconspicuous, walking around the room and

02:14:10.729 --> 02:14:12.433
stealing people's money!

02:14:12.433 --> 02:14:14.463
TRAVIS: It's that damn bird.

02:14:14.463 --> 02:14:20.155
LAURA: Kiri? I think she'd be noticeable
downstairs taking people's money.

02:14:20.155 --> 02:14:21.947
SAM: Is Kiri with us?

02:14:21.947 --> 02:14:23.989
MATT: Kiri is with Yasha.

02:14:23.989 --> 02:14:26.143
SAM: Kiri, did you steal our money?

02:14:26.143 --> 02:14:31.652
MATT: (chirping), (like Jester) "Go fuck
yourself!"

02:14:31.652 --> 02:14:35.909
TRAVIS: Don't stop there. She's a kleptomaniac. I
can tell!

02:14:35.909 --> 02:14:43.232
LAURA: I might be able to help us. Also, there was
this little girl who seemed really sweet, but she

02:14:43.232 --> 02:14:49.955
was walking around inconspicuously throughout the
room, and maybe she did it.

02:14:49.955 --> 02:14:54.723
MARISHA: I also don't think this was necessarily a
one-person job. Normally there's a couple people

02:14:54.723 --> 02:14:57.878
doing stuff like that, or one person is a runner,
and one person is a looker.

02:14:57.878 --> 02:15:00.561
LAURA: Maybe we should ask Irena if it happens
often when these things go on.

02:15:00.561 --> 02:15:01.837
TRAVIS: I thought you said you had something.

02:15:01.837 --> 02:15:05.490
LAURA: Oh, yes. I have a spell that can locate
objects.

02:15:05.490 --> 02:15:09.596
SAM: That cuts down on our detective work a lot.

02:15:09.596 --> 02:15:13.352
LAURA: Well, I could locate potentially a money
purse.

02:15:13.352 --> 02:15:18.179
MARISHA: Do you remember what my bag looked like?
It matches my sash that you still have on your wand.

02:15:18.387 --> 02:15:19.533
LAURA: It's on this wand, yes!

02:15:19.533 --> 02:15:22.962
MARISHA: I almost forgot we tied that on! That was
funny. Man, we were drunk.

02:15:22.962 --> 02:15:24.595
TRAVIS: Can we bring the volume level down?

02:15:24.595 --> 02:15:26.128
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:15:26.128 --> 02:15:29.032
SAM: But it was only the five who competed who
were robbed.

02:15:29.032 --> 02:15:33.556
LAURA: It was only the five who got stupid
drunk.

02:15:34.066 --> 02:15:35.759
MARISHA: We were super drunk.

02:15:36.213 --> 02:15:39.452
SAM: It could be because we won, and Blemmy's crew
stole our money.

02:15:39.452 --> 02:15:47.974
LAURA: We should find out if Blemmy's crew also
got stolen from. Do we remember if Blemmy's crew

02:15:47.974 --> 02:15:50.752
hung around the tavern afterwards?

02:15:50.752 --> 02:15:57.334
MATT: To your memory, they didn't. Shortly after
the competition, tucking their tails, they went to

02:15:57.334 --> 02:16:00.762
find another place to drink and not have to be in
the eyes of people that watched them lose.

02:16:00.762 --> 02:16:02.338
LAURA: Okay.

02:16:02.338 --> 02:16:11.768
SAM: So we're going to talk to Irena, and then
we're going to maybe find Blemmy, or maybe just

02:16:11.768 --> 02:16:13.732
follow Locate Object.

02:16:13.732 --> 02:16:16.133
LIAM: We are not going to start with the spell
that will lead us to it?

02:16:16.133 --> 02:16:20.670
TALIESIN: I say we start the spell now in case
they decide to throw away the coin purses. Unless

02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:23.856
somebody knows something that was in their purse
that was of actually of value that they could

02:16:23.856 --> 02:16:29.985
recognize. I need some bacon. Does anyone have
money for bacon?

02:16:29.985 --> 02:16:31.621
LAURA: I still have money.

02:16:31.621 --> 02:16:35.775
MARISHA: Nott, did you have any of those trinkets,
like my jade bracelet, in your bag?

02:16:35.775 --> 02:16:36.988
SAM: I'm wearing it.

02:16:36.988 --> 02:16:38.543
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:16:38.543 --> 02:16:45.501
SAM: No, I only keep my valuable things in other
pockets.

02:16:45.501 --> 02:16:50.603
LAURA: It has to be within a thousand feet, and it
only lasts for ten minutes.

02:16:50.603 --> 02:16:52.586
SAM: Within how many feet?

02:16:52.586 --> 02:16:55.246
LAURA: A thousand. Which is not that far.

02:16:55.246 --> 02:16:58.216
MARISHA: Let's see if we can get some tips, and
that's something later.

02:16:58.216 --> 02:17:03.438
LAURA: What if I cast Zone of Truth on Irena?

02:17:03.438 --> 02:17:04.811
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.

02:17:04.811 --> 02:17:06.636
SAM: Well, let's sees if she talks first.

02:17:06.636 --> 02:17:08.090
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a good idea.

02:17:08.090 --> 02:17:12.526
LAURA: But how will we know if she's telling the
truth? She seems shady as fuck.

02:17:12.526 --> 02:17:13.959
SAM: Does she? I haven't talked to her.

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:16.546
LAURA: Yeah, I don't like her at all.

02:17:16.885 --> 02:17:21.893
TALIESIN: Let's try not to escalate anything too
quickly yet.

02:17:22.327 --> 02:17:25.253
SAM: Molly could use his masculine wiles to talk
to--

02:17:25.253 --> 02:17:26.529
LAURA: I think Fjord should do it.

02:17:26.529 --> 02:17:29.530
TALIESIN: Do I have masculine wiles?

02:17:29.530 --> 02:17:34.764
SAM: You have pan wiles?

02:17:34.764 --> 02:17:39.622
TALIESIN: I'm into it. I'll take it.

02:17:39.622 --> 02:17:46.673
LAURA: "The affected creature is aware of the
spell." Always?

02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:51.629
TALIESIN: Why don't we save that for the moment
that we have somebody we definitely want to

02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:55.535
interrogate, instead of somebody who might tell us
they don't know anything.

02:17:55.535 --> 02:17:57.850
TRAVIS: Let's go down and talk to Irena.

02:17:57.850 --> 02:18:00.335
TALIESIN: And get breakfast.

02:18:00.335 --> 02:18:02.850
LAURA: We go looking for Irena. I think she did
it.

02:18:02.850 --> 02:18:10.563
MATT: You guys head down to the bottom floor of
the tavern, and it is empty. From seeing it so

02:18:10.563 --> 02:18:18.368
busy the night before, it is just 20-odd empty
tables. There is Irena at the bar, who's

02:18:18.368 --> 02:18:22.986
currently sitting down in the process eating a
sandwich, probably looking a little hungover

02:18:22.986 --> 02:18:31.905
herself. Sitting at a far table, in the middle of
cleaning out her fingernails, is Rissa.

02:18:31.905 --> 02:18:34.425
LAURA: Rissa did it.

02:18:34.425 --> 02:18:36.323
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

02:18:36.323 --> 02:18:37.412
SAM: She did it.

02:18:37.412 --> 02:18:40.409
LAURA: We should get them at the same table and
ask them questions, because they have to be within

02:18:40.409 --> 02:18:41.833
15 feet of me.

02:18:41.833 --> 02:18:43.104
TRAVIS: I don't think it was her. She's been
nice.

02:18:43.104 --> 02:18:46.107
TALIESIN: If it was Rissa, what is she still doing
here?

02:18:46.107 --> 02:18:48.060
LAURA: Oh, good point.

02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:50.796
SAM: I still think she did it.

02:18:50.796 --> 02:18:54.192
TRAVIS: I'm thankful for your seedy background
right now, Molly.

02:18:54.192 --> 02:18:57.903
TALIESIN: Let's get some breakfast, before
anything happens.

02:18:57.903 --> 02:19:00.626
MARISHA: With what fucking money, Molly?

02:19:00.626 --> 02:19:09.185
LAURA: With my money. I'll buy you guys breakfast.
(singing) Irena!

02:19:09.185 --> 02:19:16.289
MATT: You walk up. "Good morning. You're all
looking appropriately fucked."

02:19:16.289 --> 02:19:18.115
MARISHA: Yeah, in a few ways.

02:19:18.115 --> 02:19:19.737
MATT: "What can I get for you?"

02:19:19.737 --> 02:19:23.320
SAM: Bacon.

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:28.582
MATT: "Breakfast can be done, let me grab that.
Sid! Sid, more breakfast!"

02:19:28.582 --> 02:19:32.607
LAURA: Irena, did you see anybody taking all of
our money last night?

02:19:32.607 --> 02:19:34.819
MATT: "No, why? Did someone take all your money
last night?"

02:19:34.819 --> 02:19:37.188
LAURA: Does it happen all the time when people do
this drinking game?

02:19:37.188 --> 02:19:40.717
MATT: "If you're not paying attention and you have
a lot on you, well, that's your own fault."

02:19:40.717 --> 02:19:45.389
MARISHA: Do you know anyone where that's their
little side hobby?

02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:49.762
MATT: "I don't know anyone particularly, but it
happens sometimes. That's why most folks that go

02:19:49.762 --> 02:19:51.954
"out only take a few coins with them."

02:19:51.954 --> 02:19:57.421
TRAVIS: The fucking kids had, like, six coins on
them. Happens all the time.

02:19:57.421 --> 02:20:01.146
MATT: "If you're walking around with a bank in
your pocket, I mean, you're asking for it."

02:20:01.146 --> 02:20:06.066
LAURA: Wait, what did you guys do with our cart?

02:20:06.066 --> 02:20:07.673
TRAVIS: It's out front.

02:20:07.673 --> 02:20:09.212
TALIESIN: It was strung up.

02:20:09.212 --> 02:20:10.931
TRAVIS: It was tied to the hitching post.

02:20:10.931 --> 02:20:12.896
LAURA: Would you have woken up in your drunken
stupor?

02:20:12.896 --> 02:20:14.815
LIAM: Of course I would.

02:20:14.815 --> 02:20:17.834
SAM: We'll go check.

02:20:17.834 --> 02:20:21.076
LAURA: Yeah, we go look at the cart. Is it still
there and protected?

02:20:21.076 --> 02:20:27.007
MATT: You turn around and the cart is protected.
There are crownsguard that patrol the main area.

02:20:27.007 --> 02:20:31.365
It's not as busy as it was last night, of course.
It seems they come out in full force. A lot of

02:20:31.365 --> 02:20:34.526
them seem to sleep during the day and then come
out at night to keep watch, because that's when a

02:20:34.526 --> 02:20:39.292
lot of things happen, but there are a few. There's
one that's posted on the far corner. It looks like

02:20:39.292 --> 02:20:43.363
nobody's messed with the cart because it is out in
the open.

02:20:43.363 --> 02:20:45.264
LAURA: Should've left our money in the cart.

02:20:45.264 --> 02:20:49.878
TRAVIS: Excuse me! Can I have a mi-- (hiccups)
minute of your time?

02:20:49.878 --> 02:20:50.866
MATT: Are you referring to--

02:20:50.866 --> 02:20:51.602
TRAVIS: The crownsguard.

02:20:51.602 --> 02:20:52.988
MATT: Okay, so you've exited the tavern.

02:20:52.988 --> 02:20:54.108
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm walking out.

02:20:54.108 --> 02:20:55.018
TALIESIN: I'm sitting down to breakfast.

02:20:55.018 --> 02:20:55.901
LAURA: I'm going back in the tavern.

02:20:55.901 --> 02:20:56.575
SAM: Me too.

02:20:56.575 --> 02:21:00.479
MATT: The food is being brought out to you slowly
over the next 30 minutes or so. The crownsguard

02:21:00.479 --> 02:21:07.388
looks to you. He's human, a bushy, not really
well-kept blond beard.

02:21:07.388 --> 02:21:08.619
TRAVIS: Morning.

02:21:08.619 --> 02:21:10.362
MATT: "Morning."

02:21:10.362 --> 02:21:12.642
TRAVIS: You go first, yeah. (breathing deeply)

02:21:12.642 --> 02:21:14.183
MATT: "You all right there, buddy?"

02:21:14.183 --> 02:21:18.292
TRAVIS: We tied one on last night, in a harsh
way.

02:21:18.292 --> 02:21:20.904
MATT: "I can see you're newcomers to the town,
then."

02:21:20.904 --> 02:21:27.998
TRAVIS: Indeed. So much so that we seem to have
been relieved of our coin during last night's revelry.

02:21:27.998 --> 02:21:30.201
MATT: "You don't say."

02:21:30.201 --> 02:21:33.176
TRAVIS: Yeah. Does that happen a lot around here?

02:21:33.176 --> 02:21:37.730
MATT: "To conspicuous folks? Maybe. It happens
every now and then, we try and keep an eye out

02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:43.604
"there. As with any place of business, there is
always going to be some element of theft. Nothing

02:21:43.604 --> 02:21:47.094
"we saw out of the ordinary, but we can begin to
investigate if you like."

02:21:47.094 --> 02:21:52.105
TRAVIS: Well that might not be necessary. I
believe it was our fault. But just out of

02:21:52.105 --> 02:21:56.888
curiosity, is there anywhere in town that, I don't
know, there might be an infestation of this sort

02:21:56.888 --> 02:22:01.720
of problem? Do you know any common areas where
folks engaged in this sort of activity might

02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:08.144
gather at night or in the day? Areas of trouble
that you've dealt with before-- oh god, am I sweating?

02:22:08.144 --> 02:22:18.675
MATT: "You are, profusely. I can't say there's a
specific region. If anything, the workplaces here

02:22:18.675 --> 02:22:25.507
"are not teeming with that element. The industrious
nature of the city keeps itself busy in a very

02:22:25.507 --> 02:22:32.970
"visible place. Perhaps, somewhat here in the
Idleworks Shelf, there's the residential areas of

02:22:32.970 --> 02:22:40.392
"Silver Falls. Those are probably the more likely
areas. I wouldn't look in the lower half. Up here

02:22:40.392 --> 02:22:46.342
"in this shelf and beyond would probably be the
most-- Are you sure? I don't mind, I could

02:22:46.342 --> 02:22:50.799
"probably keep an eye out. Is there any information
you have about these individuals who robbed you may be?"

02:22:50.799 --> 02:22:55.220
TRAVIS: (sighs) We're a little light on details,
unfortunately. You know what, I'm going to go eat

02:22:55.220 --> 02:23:01.048
a half a cow, and then maybe once that's soaked up
some of this I'll return. If I remember anything else.

02:23:01.048 --> 02:23:02.603
MATT: "Yeah, I think you should go do that."

02:23:02.603 --> 02:23:04.586
TRAVIS: All right, thank you, have a good
morning.

02:23:04.586 --> 02:23:09.076
MATT: "You too." He sits back into his post,
looking a bit confused.

02:23:09.076 --> 02:23:13.153
SAM: Ask Irena about the little girl.

02:23:13.153 --> 02:23:16.888
LAURA: Irena, what about the little girl?

02:23:16.888 --> 02:23:19.189
MATT: "I don't know what you're talking about.
Which little girl?"

02:23:19.189 --> 02:23:23.322
LAURA: There's a little girl that was walking
around last night that was asking for money and stuff.

02:23:23.322 --> 02:23:28.043
MATT: "Oh yeah, the beggar. She comes in every now
and then. Some folks help her get along."

02:23:28.043 --> 02:23:30.538
LAURA: She doesn't steal things?

02:23:30.538 --> 02:23:36.244
MATT: "Not that I've seen. She's like a waif.
What're you talking about?" Make an insight check.

02:23:36.244 --> 02:23:42.721
MARISHA: Is she lying to me? Does she know more?
12.

02:23:42.721 --> 02:23:50.351
MATT: I mean, as best as you can read she seems to
be forthright. As best as you can read.

02:23:50.351 --> 02:23:52.981
LAURA: I'm going to cast Zone of Truth.

02:23:52.981 --> 02:23:55.918
MATT: Okay. So what's the saving throw on that?
What's the DC?

02:23:55.918 --> 02:23:57.093
TRAVIS: I like it.

02:23:57.093 --> 02:23:58.184
LAURA: Charisma...

02:23:58.184 --> 02:23:59.267
TRAVIS: Cut to the fucking chase!

02:23:59.267 --> 02:24:00.372
LAURA: 15.

02:24:00.372 --> 02:24:01.835
TRAVIS: Trim the fat!

02:24:01.835 --> 02:24:09.628
MATT: No, she fails. She goes like, "What's going
on?"

02:24:09.628 --> 02:24:11.411
LAURA: What are you talking about?

02:24:11.411 --> 02:24:17.561
MATT: Because if I recall, yeah, she is aware of
the spell. She's like, "What sort of trickery are

02:24:17.561 --> 02:24:20.514
"you doing here? I don't like this. I'll ask you to
leave."

02:24:20.514 --> 02:24:26.097
LAURA: Oh, I don't think you need to do that. I'm
just, you know, curious about what happened last

02:24:26.097 --> 02:24:32.280
night, if you have ever seen any shady figures in
here.

02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:36.075
MATT: "There are many shady figures that come
through here. It's a town."

02:24:36.075 --> 02:24:37.991
TRAVIS: (cooing) More specific!

02:24:37.991 --> 02:24:41.641
LAURA: Do you know of anyone who would've stolen
coins from people?

02:24:41.641 --> 02:24:43.380
SAM: Who was here last night?

02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:48.281
MATT: "There was a lot of people here last night.
I know you're asking me-- Look, I'm a

02:24:48.281 --> 02:24:53.683
"shady-looking character sometimes as well. I can't
pick it. There's a lot of hard-working people here."

02:24:53.683 --> 02:24:55.393
LAURA: Did you steal the money?

02:24:55.393 --> 02:24:57.354
MATT: "I did not steal your money!"

02:24:57.354 --> 02:25:00.248
LAURA: I'm just checking. Do you know who stole
our money?

02:25:00.248 --> 02:25:02.420
MATT: "No, I don't know who stole your money!"

02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:04.251
LAURA: Hey Rissa, come here for a second!

02:25:04.251 --> 02:25:07.988
TALIESIN: But if you were going to suspect
somebody, who would it be?

02:25:07.988 --> 02:25:16.910
MATT: "I don't know. You damn well pissed off Ol'
Blemmy. He's a possible one. Otherwise, I don't

02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:22.842
"know if anyone got too friendly with you last
night. I mean you've got to get close to take your money."

02:25:22.842 --> 02:25:24.083
LAURA: Was anyone friendly with you guys?

02:25:24.083 --> 02:25:24.903
TALIESIN: Not with me.

02:25:24.903 --> 02:25:29.017
MATT: "I didn't send any people up to your rooms,
because you told me not to pay for-- I was holding

02:25:29.017 --> 02:25:32.910
"your cash, which I've still got by the way. And
the offer still stands. But--"

02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:35.449
MARISHA: Is there a thieves' guild?

02:25:35.449 --> 02:25:36.676
MATT: "I don't know, probably."

02:25:36.676 --> 02:25:37.773
LAURA: Rissa, come here!

02:25:37.773 --> 02:25:39.926
MATT: Rissa comes up. "I can help you?"

02:25:39.926 --> 02:25:43.779
SAM: Irena, if Molly was interested, would you
like--

02:25:43.779 --> 02:25:47.517
LAURA: Snip his--

02:25:47.517 --> 02:25:49.106
SAM: No, just like--

02:25:49.106 --> 02:25:50.637
TALIESIN: I don't understand what you're trying to
imply here.

02:25:50.637 --> 02:25:53.676
SAM: Nevermind, let's go to Rissa.

02:25:53.676 --> 02:25:59.739
LAURA: No seriously though, what was this? Why is
this having sex?

02:25:59.739 --> 02:26:05.206
SAM: Don't you guys use scissors when you have sex
with each other?

02:26:05.206 --> 02:26:07.403
MARISHA: Is this a goblin thing?

02:26:07.403 --> 02:26:08.489
TALIESIN: This might be a goblin thing.

02:26:08.489 --> 02:26:09.762
SAM: This is real.

02:26:09.762 --> 02:26:11.925
LAURA: Stop it.

02:26:11.925 --> 02:26:15.374
LIAM: Just a boulder parchment shears reference.
It's simple.

02:26:15.374 --> 02:26:24.022
LAURA: Rissa! Do you know of anyone who steals
money from drunk people?

02:26:24.022 --> 02:26:28.330
MATT: "Not personally. I'm sure there are folks
out there."

02:26:28.330 --> 02:26:33.677
LAURA: Did you see anyone taking our friends'
money last night?

02:26:33.677 --> 02:26:38.656
MATT: She rubs her temples and you can tell she is
a little hungover herself, too. She's like, "No..."

02:26:38.656 --> 02:26:42.601
TALIESIN: Did those two gentlemen come back into
the bar at any point?

02:26:42.601 --> 02:26:44.833
TRAVIS: Fitz and Ashton.

02:26:44.833 --> 02:26:46.446
LAURA: Ooh, good call.

02:26:46.446 --> 02:26:52.895
MATT: "I saw them come in at one point, but then
leave when they noticed I was still hanging with

02:26:52.895 --> 02:26:55.986
"you folks, so thank you for that. I appreciate
that."

02:26:55.986 --> 02:26:59.694
TALIESIN: I mean, at the very least that'll be
fun.

02:26:59.694 --> 02:27:08.697
LAURA: Man. Do we have any other questions to ask?
Who are you all attracted to. Do you guys like me?

02:27:08.697 --> 02:27:13.399
SAM: That's what I was trying to get to. Wait, us?
We have to answer truthfully?

02:27:13.399 --> 02:27:14.833
LAURA: Yeah, because you were standing next to me
anyway.

02:27:14.833 --> 02:27:16.181
LIAM: If you're within 15 feet.

02:27:16.181 --> 02:27:18.014
SAM: You're not my type.

02:27:18.014 --> 02:27:19.781
MATT: If all the rest of you are in the area?

02:27:20.028 --> 02:27:22.501
TALIESIN: Everybody's my type. I'm really pretty
easy.

02:27:22.501 --> 02:27:24.520
LIAM: I was at the door. I don't know how big the
place is.

02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.977
MATT: If anybody else steps into that zone, you
have to make a saving throw.

02:27:26.977 --> 02:27:28.919
LIAM: I was going to do something before Jester
did what she did.

02:27:28.919 --> 02:27:31.089
MARISHA: What was your question?

02:27:31.089 --> 02:27:35.199
LAURA: Who are you attracted to? Do you like me?
Are we friends? Do you really like me and stuff?

02:27:35.199 --> 02:27:36.358
MATT: Make a saving throw.

02:27:36.358 --> 02:27:37.631
MARISHA: Wow, that was a layer of questions.

02:27:37.631 --> 02:27:39.263
SAM: I like you. You're nice.

02:27:39.263 --> 02:27:39.982
LAURA: Really?

02:27:39.982 --> 02:27:41.017
SAM: Yes.

02:27:41.017 --> 02:27:41.835
MATT: Charisma, right?

02:27:41.835 --> 02:27:42.857
LAURA: Yeah.

02:27:42.857 --> 02:27:44.529
MARISHA: What is it, charisma saving throw? 16.

02:27:44.529 --> 02:27:46.475
MATT: Yeah, you resist it.

02:27:46.475 --> 02:27:49.096
MARISHA: I like you a lot. Here's the deal.

02:27:49.096 --> 02:27:55.510
(laughter)

02:27:55.554 --> 02:27:58.678
MARISHA: Has there been a raise in criminal
activity? Is there something in the town that

02:27:58.678 --> 02:28:07.729
would start provoking people to want to pickpocket
more? Is the rise in the war effort bringing

02:28:07.729 --> 02:28:10.054
people down? There's got to be some reason.

02:28:10.054 --> 02:28:15.155
MATT: Rissa goes, "I mean, it's possible, I
imagine. People are distracted. They're working

02:28:15.155 --> 02:28:20.135
"hard. They're having to push out double time in a
lot of their work to get things out to the front

02:28:20.135 --> 02:28:23.801
"lines. It's possible."

02:28:23.801 --> 02:28:27.062
TALIESIN: Whoever took our purses has our drink
tokens too.

02:28:27.062 --> 02:28:29.777
MARISHA: They do have our drink tokens. That was
in the bag.

02:28:29.777 --> 02:28:32.457
TRAVIS: You didn't need to remind her, she's ready
to pop as it is, all right?

02:28:32.457 --> 02:28:35.495
TALIESIN: I'm just saying that if drink tokens
come back to the bar--

02:28:35.495 --> 02:28:38.621
LAURA: Then you know. (gasps)

02:28:38.621 --> 02:28:44.522
MARISHA: I wouldn't come back the next night if it
were me. I would want to make sure that we were gone.

02:28:44.522 --> 02:28:47.113
TALIESIN: But somebody's got them.

02:28:47.113 --> 02:28:54.329
LIAM: How could they even use them? Because only
the winners that everyone saw won them.

02:28:54.329 --> 02:28:57.682
SAM: They're probably not going to use them.
They're just one drink. They would keep

02:28:57.682 --> 02:28:59.689
all the hundreds of gold.

02:28:59.689 --> 02:29:01.522
TALIESIN: I would keep it, though.

02:29:01.522 --> 02:29:06.248
MARISHA: But I think that could be a better
target for your lost object spell.

02:29:06.248 --> 02:29:07.711
That's what I was thinking.

02:29:07.711 --> 02:29:11.402
LAURA: Yeah. Because it probably blends in. Are
they the same sort of shape as regular coins?

02:29:11.402 --> 02:29:14.653
MATT: They are, but they're wooden and a little
bit bigger than an actual gold coin.

02:29:14.653 --> 02:29:18.344
TALIESIN: Anytime I've stolen something I
couldn't use later I've always kept it for

02:29:18.344 --> 02:29:20.311
sentimental reasons. I'm not sure why.

02:29:20.364 --> 02:29:22.535
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a prize. It's a reminder of
your good job.

02:29:22.535 --> 02:29:24.994
LAURA: That's smart. Should I cast it?

02:29:24.994 --> 02:29:27.805
TALIESIN: I don't steal anymore. Much.
Sometimes--

02:29:27.805 --> 02:29:30.147
MARISHA: Hang on. Irena.

02:29:30.147 --> 02:29:32.592
MATT: "Yes? What you asking?"

02:29:32.592 --> 02:29:34.886
MARISHA: Do you have any new staff members?

02:29:34.886 --> 02:29:42.343
MATT: "No, it's just me and Syd." At this point
Syd brings out the last of the food, the male

02:29:42.343 --> 02:29:51.558
gnome who you saw when you first entered. He's
like, "So, all of your food is ready. Enjoy."

02:29:51.558 --> 02:29:59.841
MARISHA: You mentioned being able to get us
friends and other type of services. Where do you

02:29:59.841 --> 02:30:01.333
find those resources?

02:30:01.333 --> 02:30:02.909
MATT: "Through a friend of mine."

02:30:02.909 --> 02:30:04.251
MARISHA: What's her name?

02:30:04.251 --> 02:30:07.732
MATT: "Why are you asking me all these
questions? I didn't send anyone up to your room,

02:30:07.732 --> 02:30:11.248
"and I'm not going to spill all of my business
propositions your direction."

02:30:11.248 --> 02:30:17.151
MARISHA: I don't think you did any of that at all.
I just think you might know who did. Even if you

02:30:17.206 --> 02:30:20.451
don't consciously know, I think you have an idea.

02:30:20.451 --> 02:30:24.567
MATT: "Not really, lass."

02:30:24.567 --> 02:30:26.867
LAURA: She's telling the truth.

02:30:26.867 --> 02:30:29.300
LIAM: Do you give a shit about our problems?

02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:30.729
MATT: "No."

02:30:30.729 --> 02:30:35.069
TRAVIS: Rissa, do you know where this Ashton and
Fitz stay?

02:30:35.069 --> 02:30:44.913
MATT: She nods and takes another sip of her
morning coffee, and goes, "Aye, they're about two

02:30:44.913 --> 02:30:53.863
"blocks down from my father's... shack. A couple of
kids that-- although at this hour they're probably

02:30:53.863 --> 02:30:55.885
"working at the anvil."

02:30:55.937 --> 02:30:59.207
MARISHA: If I wanted to go hock some stolen goods,
where would I go?

02:30:59.207 --> 02:31:04.332
MATT: "I don't know. I haven't hocked stolen goods
around here. I'm sorry."

02:31:04.332 --> 02:31:06.505
SAM: One more question!

02:31:06.505 --> 02:31:09.820
MATT: To which one? You have both Rissa--

02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:13.353
SAM: Irena. Where does the pianist live?

02:31:13.353 --> 02:31:15.913
MATT: "What, of the band?"

02:31:15.913 --> 02:31:18.709
SAM: Yeah, the guy playing the piano.

02:31:18.709 --> 02:31:20.651
MATT: "Here! He has a room on the third floor."

02:31:20.651 --> 02:31:24.877
LAURA: Well, maybe if I cast Locate Object we'll
find out.

02:31:24.877 --> 02:31:27.344
SAM: What's his name? We never asked.

02:31:27.344 --> 02:31:30.237
LAURA: He was really talented, though. I mean,
like, super duper.

02:31:30.237 --> 02:31:34.253
MATT: He was Weimar.

02:31:34.253 --> 02:31:35.622
LAURA: Weimar.

02:31:35.622 --> 02:31:38.838
TALIESIN: He had to flip a page for that one. It
was exciting.

02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:45.460
TRAVIS: Why don't we start by going around where
Fitz and Ashton lived and then maybe we can pay a

02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:47.520
little visit to Rissa's pops?

02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:52.448
TALIESIN: Yeah, she said they lived by her pops'
place.

02:31:52.448 --> 02:31:55.745
LAURA: Yeah, we'll go and I'll cast Locate Object
and maybe we'll just pass by something.

02:31:55.745 --> 02:31:58.389
TALIESIN: I wanted to meet Pops anyway. He sounds
interesting.

02:31:58.389 --> 02:32:06.423
MATT: She's like, "Oh, all right. Fair warning--
pardon me, rough morning."

02:32:06.423 --> 02:32:08.778
TALIESIN: We feel that.

02:32:08.778 --> 02:32:14.381
MATT: "So where are you wanting, are you looking
for the boys? The Steelbringer's Forge first, or

02:32:14.381 --> 02:32:15.854
"going to my pop's place?"

02:32:15.854 --> 02:32:21.552
TALIESIN: We'll go to your father's place first. I
think we'll maybe, if we're in the mood, pop into

02:32:21.552 --> 02:32:24.486
their place while they're not home, perhaps.

02:32:24.486 --> 02:32:26.918
MARISHA: Who? What, the Fitz and that guy?

02:32:26.918 --> 02:32:32.980
MATT: "Okay, follow me." She gets up and finishes
her coffee, sets it back down, and you guys take

02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:37.864
whatever scraps remain of your breakfast and make
your way back out into the street.

02:32:37.864 --> 02:32:42.385
LAURA: Pocket bacon! Before we leave, I ask Irena,
who's still in the Zone of Truth, are you really

02:32:42.435 --> 02:32:47.678
interested in Fjord or are you just flirting with
him because it makes you some money and stuff?

02:32:47.678 --> 02:32:54.769
MATT: "Both? I'm a businesswoman, but I've got my
needs."

02:32:54.769 --> 02:33:03.321
LAURA: Oh. Okay. Thank you. I cast Locate Object
on the coins.

02:33:03.321 --> 02:33:07.579
SAM: Already? We're not there yet. Now? Okay.

02:33:07.579 --> 02:33:10.926
LAURA: It lasts for ten minutes. What if it's in
the tavern still?

02:33:10.926 --> 02:33:12.289
SAM: Makes sense.

02:33:12.289 --> 02:33:16.228
MATT: Okay, so you cast it. You're in the tavern.
You're not getting anything.

02:33:16.228 --> 02:33:17.910
SAM: Let's run!

02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:20.040
TALIESIN: We're going to put you on a cart, and
we're going to take the cart.

02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:23.047
LAURA: I feel like we'll walk faster than the cart
will go.

02:33:23.047 --> 02:33:24.836
TALIESIN: Will we walk faster than the cart will
go?

02:33:24.836 --> 02:33:28.531
MATT: In the town, getting the cart around can be
a bit of a pain. It's comparable, but you also

02:33:28.531 --> 02:33:29.854
have to deal with a cart.

02:33:29.854 --> 02:33:31.736
LAURA: Let's walk quickly!

02:33:31.736 --> 02:33:40.059
MATT: Rissa leads you further through the Shelf. At
this point, once again, the town is fairly quiet,

02:33:40.065 --> 02:33:44.102
and most folks you do see in the street are in the
process of carrying supplies. There are a few

02:33:44.102 --> 02:33:48.976
horse-drawn carts that have stacks of metal ingots
that are being taken from above or below, or vice

02:33:49.028 --> 02:33:58.302
versa. You can see partially made metal plates and
curved structures of larger things that are being

02:33:58.302 --> 02:34:01.548
developed and created separately and then all
being brought to a singular location, probably

02:34:01.548 --> 02:34:09.028
down near the artillery yard. It's a very
interesting black and white, day and night

02:34:09.028 --> 02:34:18.338
separation of how the people live in this city. A
short jaunt around, probably the spell does fade

02:34:18.338 --> 02:34:23.546
before you get there, but you're still not picking
up any blip. About a few minutes after the spell

02:34:23.546 --> 02:34:31.006
fades, you get to the outside of a small shack.
It's got metallic siding, there are rivets in it.

02:34:31.006 --> 02:34:37.367
You see it has a roof that is metal sheets. There
is a smokestack on top that's giving out this lazy

02:34:37.367 --> 02:34:43.581
smoke drip that makes its way into the sky, and a
sign out front that says "Tinkertop Inventions."

02:34:43.581 --> 02:34:45.062
MARISHA and LAURA: Aw!

02:34:45.062 --> 02:34:48.060
TRAVIS: When we get there after our run, I chuck
up a little salsa into the back of my throat and

02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:49.437
swallow it down.

02:34:49.437 --> 02:34:51.237
TALIESIN: Really? All right.

02:34:51.237 --> 02:35:09.956
MATT: She goes (sighs). Rissa rolls her eyes, and
knocks on the metallic door. "Yes? Come in." "Dad,

02:35:09.956 --> 02:35:18.060
"it's me. I have some friends here, they just want
to say hi. They got thieved." "Oh, that's all

02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:25.631
"right, come on in, certainly!" (sighs) She opens
the door, and on the inside, you already hear the

02:35:25.631 --> 02:35:32.452
whirring of hundreds of tiny clockwork objects. On
the inside, you can see, wall to wall, clocks of

02:35:32.452 --> 02:35:38.985
all sizes. Some broken, springs exposed. Some that
are fixed, and clicking away. Some that have small

02:35:38.985 --> 02:35:46.112
sculptures that move in a circle around a central
area. You can see partially made pulleys, small

02:35:46.112 --> 02:35:51.645
toys that are set up on the corner, some wooden,
some metal, and all of them have some sort of

02:35:51.645 --> 02:35:56.184
built-in clockwork locomotion to them, though they
are currently still. There are two sets of

02:35:56.184 --> 02:36:00.787
lanterns that are hanging in the back, giving the
faint light which is, as you enter, giving this

02:36:00.787 --> 02:36:04.204
dark silhouette to a lot of these objects, but as
you walk into the light and look behind you, you

02:36:04.204 --> 02:36:08.649
can see the detail work in them, and they're very
beautiful and very well-made. It's at that point you

02:36:08.649 --> 02:36:15.378
hear a (crash) "Ah! Ugh!" You glance over and you
can see, hopping up and down, running his hand

02:36:15.378 --> 02:36:28.778
like this, this older gnome character with patches
of white-gray hair, this big bush of a white

02:36:28.778 --> 02:36:35.918
beard. It's well-trimmed up here and then comes to
a point at the bottom. Very large spectacles with

02:36:35.918 --> 02:36:44.320
a number of smaller and even smaller lenses in the
front of it. He's currently wearing a leather

02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:49.035
apron and sleeves that are rolled up, and one of
his hands is currently now bleeding on the edge

02:36:49.035 --> 02:36:56.294
and he's like (distressed noises). "I'm terribly
sorry about that! Come forward! She said you're

02:36:56.294 --> 02:37:01.119
"the friends of my lass there. How are you doing?
What's your names?"

02:37:01.119 --> 02:37:08.829
TRAVIS: Morning. We're The Mighty Nein. We had the
pleasure of meeting your daughter yesterday. She

02:37:08.829 --> 02:37:11.144
showed us a great time last night.

02:37:11.144 --> 02:37:16.889
MATT: "Oh, did you, dear? That's so nice! You're
making friends." Rissa's like, "Dad, please stop

02:37:16.889 --> 02:37:21.377
"it. Look, they just wanted to come by, they had
some questions, I think. Do what you're going to

02:37:21.377 --> 02:37:23.374
"do, please, so we get going."

02:37:23.374 --> 02:37:28.955
TALIESIN: How close are we to the other houses at
this point? To the boys?

02:37:28.955 --> 02:37:30.761
LAURA: Probably not within a thousand feet.

02:37:30.761 --> 02:37:36.509
MATT: The boys, she mentioned earlier, are a few
blocks down, or a few buildings down and up from

02:37:36.509 --> 02:37:43.365
where you are. "Well, at the very least let me
introduce myself! I'm Mastermaker Cleff Tinkertop!"

02:37:43.365 --> 02:37:46.835
LAURA: Cleff or Cliff?

02:37:46.835 --> 02:37:48.070
MATT: "Cleff."

02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:50.469
TALIESIN: I was excited to see what sort of
stuff--

02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:55.662
MATT: "Creator and experimenter of all things
metallic and clicking!"

02:37:55.662 --> 02:37:58.239
LAURA: Your shop is beautiful!

02:37:58.239 --> 02:38:07.247
MATT: "Thank you so much! I appreciate that! So
yeah, what can I do for you?"

02:38:07.247 --> 02:38:09.661
LAURA: Do you have any little toys that Kiri would
like?"

02:38:09.661 --> 02:38:11.278
MATT: "What's--?"

02:38:11.278 --> 02:38:14.268
SAM: Kiri's our little daughter, she's a bird."

02:38:14.268 --> 02:38:15.624
LAURA: Kiri is right here.

02:38:15.624 --> 02:38:20.430
MATT: You look over and Yasha's still behind. Kiri
(chirping). He's like, "That's a mighty big bird!"

02:38:20.430 --> 02:38:22.645
LAURA: She's a little girl.

02:38:22.645 --> 02:38:28.384
MATT: She leans forward, looks up to him. (like
Cleff) "She's a mighty big bird!" He's like,

02:38:28.384 --> 02:38:32.447
"That's a nice trick on that one! I like that."

02:38:32.447 --> 02:38:33.810
LAURA: She's very talented.

02:38:33.810 --> 02:38:38.545
MATT: "Do you like--" and he pulls this small
contraption, it's actually a miniature version of

02:38:38.545 --> 02:38:44.032
what you saw those large bolt throwers that were
constructed out front, where it has this bowed arc

02:38:44.032 --> 02:38:51.768
and there's a small, blunted stick in it. He goes,
"All you do is pull back on this trigger." Ping!

02:38:51.768 --> 02:38:55.244
It fires off, narrowly missing the side of Beau's
head, hits something, and you hear glass shatter

02:38:55.244 --> 02:39:05.144
in the background and he goes, "Oh, maybe not that one."
Puts it back. (cranking) And hands something over

02:39:05.144 --> 02:39:12.590
to Kiri, who accepts it. There's a moment where
things are awkward and there's a tension, and

02:39:12.590 --> 02:39:18.689
you're about to go-- before it opens up and from the
inside you see this tiny metallic bird, its wings

02:39:18.689 --> 02:39:27.657
flap up and down. A music box begins to play
(metallic song) and Kiri, looking at this, begins

02:39:27.657 --> 02:39:35.598
mimicking exactly the sound of the music box
(metallic song). It's almost one beat behind it,

02:39:35.598 --> 02:39:40.378
until it synchronizes, and she's mimicking at such
an incredibly fast pace behind it that they're

02:39:40.378 --> 02:39:47.903
almost in unison, until eventually it slows down
and comes to a stop. Kiri looks back to you (chirping).

02:39:47.903 --> 02:39:51.897
LAURA: Do you like it? How much is that?

02:39:51.897 --> 02:39:59.122
MATT: "Oh, that one, it's a beautiful piece. I'll
be happy to let it go for about three gold pieces."

02:39:59.122 --> 02:40:05.964
LAURA: Three gold pieces. I think that's worth it,
Kiri. Okay. Three gold pieces.

02:40:05.964 --> 02:40:10.957
MATT: There's a whole smattering of cool
contraptions, now that you're looking at the back, too.

02:40:10.957 --> 02:40:18.689
Some that look like they could be armaments,
almost. Some that look like they're the insides of

02:40:18.689 --> 02:40:20.195
larger machine pieces.

02:40:20.195 --> 02:40:23.112
TALIESIN: What's the thing you're most proud of?

02:40:23.112 --> 02:40:31.405
MATT: "Ah, proud of, now? I have one thing I'm
working on, if you want to see it."

02:40:31.405 --> 02:40:33.059
TALIESIN: Oh, absolutely!

02:40:33.059 --> 02:40:39.623
MATT: "Okay! I've been hoping they'd pay attention
to this. Since the whole war's going on, I think

02:40:39.623 --> 02:40:52.028
"it'd be quite useful. I've lost some good favor
with folks in power, but I hope maybe this will

02:40:52.028 --> 02:41:01.404
"turn my fortune around." He goes around, off to
the shelf, and pulls this down, and a bow of some

02:41:01.404 --> 02:41:07.388
kind that's affixed to this large device. It looks
like a crossbow, but it's got a heavy crank on one

02:41:07.388 --> 02:41:13.848
side, and it has all these extra grooves put in
where it's easy to assemble a bolt in there. The

02:41:13.848 --> 02:41:19.467
actual shaft of it is made of this polished,
treated wood, with metal casing where the grip is.

02:41:19.467 --> 02:41:25.937
It's like a half-clockwork, gear-based crank hand
crossbow.

02:41:25.937 --> 02:41:27.520
TRAVIS: A repeating crossbow.

02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:28.853
MARISHA: It's a repeating crossbow.

02:41:28.853 --> 02:41:30.403
SAM: How does it work?

02:41:30.403 --> 02:41:37.190
MATT: "Well, you lower the bolt into here, and you
crank it back real fast," and it's like

02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:44.987
(squeaking) as he cranks it, "I probably have to
oil this. Crank it. Then, you just release!" This

02:41:44.987 --> 02:41:51.668
one goes, just parting Caleb's hair, into the roof
above.

02:41:51.743 --> 02:41:54.540
LIAM: How many gold is that toy?

02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:59.208
MATT: "Well, this one, you see, I had a friend of
mine go ahead and help prepare it

02:41:59.208 --> 02:42:01.709
"with some magical enchantment."

02:42:01.751 --> 02:42:03.184
LAURA: (distorted) Whoa!

02:42:03.184 --> 02:42:06.888
SAM: What the fuck was that?

02:42:06.888 --> 02:42:12.097
LAURA: I don't know, it sounded like a cow, or
like a manatee was at the table, I don't know.

02:42:12.097 --> 02:42:16.857
MATT: "I call this one The Tinkertop Boltblaster
1000."

02:42:16.857 --> 02:42:18.310
LAURA: Whoa!

02:42:18.310 --> 02:42:20.469
TALIESIN: What happened to the other 999?

02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:22.214
LAURA: How much is it?

02:42:22.214 --> 02:42:24.890
MATT: "This one runs just over 2000 gold."

02:42:24.890 --> 02:42:27.855
LAURA: Whoa, that is a lot of gold.

02:42:27.855 --> 02:42:30.228
MATT: "Well, it's my prototype, so if I'm going to
let it go..."

02:42:30.228 --> 02:42:32.027
SAM: Am I allowed to rob him?

02:42:32.027 --> 02:42:34.710
MARISHA and TALIESIN: No.

02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:38.108
MATT: Rissa's like, "Dad, they don't want it, it's
fine. No one wants all your bullshit, please."

02:42:38.108 --> 02:42:41.498
TRAVIS: That's not true, it actually is quite
impressive.

02:42:41.498 --> 02:42:45.968
MATT: "You wouldn't say that if you'd known what
some of his other things have done." He gets quiet

02:42:45.968 --> 02:42:53.977
for a second and recoils, quietly hurt. He goes,
"It comes with the job sometimes. Not everything

02:42:53.977 --> 02:42:55.631
"works out like you hope."

02:42:55.631 --> 02:43:00.875
TRAVIS: You said you'd lost some favor with people
in power. I don't mean to pry, but would you mind

02:43:00.875 --> 02:43:02.808
sharing what happened?

02:43:02.808 --> 02:43:07.187
MATT: "Uh--" and Rissa's like, "Ah, it's-- you
don't have to answer him. We can go find the

02:43:07.187 --> 02:43:10.370
"boys." "It's all right." Make a persuasion check.

02:43:10.370 --> 02:43:17.470
TRAVIS: Come on. Shamone! Oh, yeah, that's a 20.

02:43:17.470 --> 02:43:31.721
MATT: 20? You see his trepidation there, and he
goes, "You look like you've got an honest face,

02:43:31.721 --> 02:43:44.928
"so: I was working on a job here for the wardens of
the Gearhold Prison down below. I was helping them

02:43:44.928 --> 02:43:51.975
"and came up with, at their request, what would be
a clockwork warden. Something that could help keep

02:43:51.975 --> 02:43:59.150
"watch over some of the more dangerous and
difficult inmates of the prison below. And I did

02:43:59.150 --> 02:44:14.232
"it. I was very proud of it. On its first foray, it
had some faults I didn't see coming, and we

02:44:14.232 --> 02:44:19.037
"couldn't control it. It began to just destroy
whatever was in its way."

02:44:19.037 --> 02:44:21.351
LIAM: Are you speaking of an automaton?

02:44:21.351 --> 02:44:23.012
MATT: "More or less."

02:44:23.012 --> 02:44:24.937
LAURA: Did it kill people?

02:44:24.937 --> 02:44:32.942
MATT: "They tell me. They keep it down there
still. They've sealed it off and it's been

02:44:32.942 --> 02:44:38.722
"there for the better part of two years and every
now then, they like to remind me. I didn't mean

02:44:38.722 --> 02:44:43.659
"anything bad by it. I was just doing my job and I
thought I was very proud of my work. I didn't see

02:44:43.659 --> 02:44:48.907
"the problems there. I was just trying to help."

02:44:48.907 --> 02:44:50.807
MARISHA: How do they remind you?

02:44:50.807 --> 02:44:52.903
MATT: "They come by and tell me."

02:44:52.903 --> 02:44:55.825
TRAVIS: Are there punishments levied against you?

02:44:55.868 --> 02:45:08.617
MATT: "Thankfully, not many. I'm still paying off
my fine. They were going to try and destroy the

02:45:08.617 --> 02:45:14.304
"thing, but unfortunately they've had to allocate
their attention to many places, and now with the

02:45:14.304 --> 02:45:19.796
"war coming, I don't know if they'll ever get to
it. But as long as it's down there, it's a black

02:45:19.839 --> 02:45:26.779
"spot on my name, and her name." Rissa goes, "Dad,
just please stop it."

02:45:26.779 --> 02:45:28.108
LAURA: We could destroy it.

02:45:28.108 --> 02:45:29.555
SAM: Or get it back for you.

02:45:29.555 --> 02:45:31.598
LAURA: And then you could give us the crossbow.

02:45:31.598 --> 02:45:36.293
MATT: "I don't want to send any more people to
their death, at the very least."

02:45:36.293 --> 02:45:37.894
LAURA: We're really strong.

02:45:37.894 --> 02:45:41.829
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're kind of death-adverse.

02:45:41.829 --> 02:45:48.580
MARISHA: Plus, we would love to pay for your
crossbow, but we're currently light.

02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:50.399
TRAVIS: Fuck, we're broke.

02:45:50.399 --> 02:45:54.192
LAURA: All of our money was stolen. All of their
money was stolen. I was sober.

02:45:54.192 --> 02:45:56.347
MATT: "Good for you."

02:45:56.347 --> 02:45:57.302
LAURA: Thank you.

02:45:57.302 --> 02:45:59.255
MATT: "A learned lesson for the rest of you."

02:45:59.255 --> 02:46:04.189
LAURA: It was a choice, you know. Everybody else
was like, "Let's get drunk!" and I was like, "That

02:46:04.189 --> 02:46:07.789
"is really bad and I should probably stay sober."

02:46:07.789 --> 02:46:18.547
MATT: "I'm very proud of you. I mean, that sounds
very kind of folks that wandered in here naught

02:46:18.547 --> 02:46:20.398
"but a few moments ago."

02:46:20.398 --> 02:46:23.902
SAM: What would you do if you had the thing back,
or--

02:46:23.902 --> 02:46:27.780
MATT: "Oh, I don't want it back, I just want it
gone. I want it destroyed, I want it taken care of

02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:29.930
"and buried. I don't want to touch it."

02:46:29.930 --> 02:46:32.209
MARISHA: Wait, who wandered in here before?

02:46:32.209 --> 02:46:33.178
MATT: "You."

02:46:33.178 --> 02:46:36.737
LAURA: Yeah, he was just talking about us. You're
still drunk, aren't you?

02:46:36.737 --> 02:46:41.687
TRAVIS: Are you afraid this clockwork warden could
be used for malign purposes?

02:46:41.687 --> 02:46:46.133
MATT: "I don't think it could be used for anything
but just killing what's in front of it right now."

02:46:46.133 --> 02:46:49.657
LIAM: So they have it penned in, but it is out of
their control?

02:46:49.657 --> 02:46:57.601
MATT: "From what I know. You'd have to go ask the
Wardenhelm. I don't go down there places. I mean,

02:46:57.601 --> 02:47:01.251
"I can't expect you to do something like that. It's
very sweet of you to offer."

02:47:01.251 --> 02:47:07.491
TRAVIS: It's tit for tat. In this case, we're
short on coin, and you make mighty fine objects.

02:47:07.491 --> 02:47:09.445
Seems to have caught the eye of most of our
group.

02:47:09.445 --> 02:47:17.559
MATT: "I mean, in a theoretical space, which is
where I live most of my days, if you were to put

02:47:17.559 --> 02:47:26.333
"this blight to rest, I'd be happy to give this to
you free of charge and my thanks."

02:47:26.333 --> 02:47:31.972
TRAVIS: We will take it under consideration.

02:47:31.972 --> 02:47:37.426
MARISHA: And, just while we're talking, you
wouldn't happen to know of any criminal

02:47:37.483 --> 02:47:41.747
undergrounds, thieves' guilds, pickpocketers,
people of the night?

02:47:41.747 --> 02:47:43.040
MATT: "I don't--"

02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:44.278
MARISHA: Roamers of shadows?

02:47:44.278 --> 02:47:46.028
MATT: "I don't delve in those places. I'm sorry."

02:47:46.028 --> 02:47:47.508
LAURA: Vampires, zombies?

02:47:47.508 --> 02:47:49.873
MATT: "I don't know what's going on!"

02:47:49.873 --> 02:47:52.812
SAM: It's okay. Calm down.

02:47:52.812 --> 02:47:55.908
TRAVIS: Cleff, do you also have simple arms?

02:47:55.908 --> 02:48:03.620
MATT: "I deal with more detailed arms. If you're
looking for simple, you're probably going to go to

02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:08.837
"the Steelbringer's Forge." Rissa goes, "That's
where the boys will probably be. That's where they work."

02:48:08.837 --> 02:48:12.610
TRAVIS: Probably heading that way anyway. The
anvil.

02:48:12.672 --> 02:48:24.307
SAM: Cleff, you know, you seem to have a fine eye
and talent for mechanical devices.

02:48:24.307 --> 02:48:26.237
MATT: "Thank you very much."

02:48:26.237 --> 02:48:33.430
SAM: Do you ever have any need of alchemical
combinations with your mechanical devices?

02:48:33.430 --> 02:48:38.091
MATT: "I'm always looking for fine oils. Clockwork
tends to need to be lubricated."

02:48:38.091 --> 02:48:50.319
SAM: I think I have a little oil, if you need it.
As a sign of good faith. Didn't we get oil at some point?

02:48:50.319 --> 02:48:51.512
LAURA: I don't think so.

02:48:51.512 --> 02:48:52.860
MARISHA: I threw mine at a troll.

02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:57.808
SAM: Wait. Oh, wait, no. I have holy water. That
is not the same thing.

02:48:57.808 --> 02:49:01.989
MATT: "That's all right. Don't worry about it.
That's okay. If you come across some oil, I could use it."

02:49:01.989 --> 02:49:04.558
SAM: All right.

02:49:04.558 --> 02:49:08.546
MATT: "Rissa. I like your friends." She's like,
"Thank you, Dad."

02:49:08.546 --> 02:49:11.581
TRAVIS: You raised her good. She's been taking
good care of us.

02:49:11.581 --> 02:49:15.826
MATT: "Have you found work yet?" "No, Dad. I'm
working on it."

02:49:15.826 --> 02:49:17.178
TRAVIS: Awkward.

02:49:17.178 --> 02:49:18.687
SAM: She's working for us.

02:49:18.687 --> 02:49:20.682
MATT: "Right, I'm working for them."

02:49:20.682 --> 02:49:21.870
TALIESIN: At the moment.

02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:24.266
MATT: "Good, good. Proud of you."

02:49:24.266 --> 02:49:26.965
MARISHA: Subcontractor work isn't too bad of a
living.

02:49:26.965 --> 02:49:31.198
MATT: "Oh, no. It's still a living. That's more
than some folks in the Empire can say."

02:49:31.198 --> 02:49:34.315
SAM: We need her Social Security Number for a 1099
by the way.

02:49:34.315 --> 02:49:36.598
(laughter)

02:49:36.598 --> 02:49:42.710
TRAVIS: I believe she's incorporated. She's
incorporated.

02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:44.672
SAM: Well, okay. Then we're fine.

02:49:44.672 --> 02:49:48.290
MATT: Any good gnome is incorporated. I mean,
that's a cultural thing.

02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:51.468
LIAM: Fucking Hupperdook bureaucracy.

02:49:51.468 --> 02:49:53.630
MATT: 13th birthday they get their S Corp set up.
It's great.

02:49:53.630 --> 02:49:56.444
(laughter)

02:49:56.444 --> 02:49:59.282
LAURA: Okay okay okay.

02:49:59.282 --> 02:50:03.008
TRAVIS: Cleff, we appreciate your time. We are
going to venture out.

02:50:03.008 --> 02:50:08.995
MATT: "Of course. I expect nothing. I really
appreciate you being so kind. Good luck."

02:50:08.995 --> 02:50:12.330
TRAVIS: Our compliments on your work. It is truly
spectacular.

02:50:12.330 --> 02:50:13.878
MATT: "Take care of my Rissania." She's like--

02:50:13.878 --> 02:50:16.315
ALL: Rissania!

02:50:16.315 --> 02:50:18.214
TRAVIS: There it is.

02:50:18.214 --> 02:50:23.145
TALIESIN: That was what I was hoping for, and it
happened.

02:50:23.145 --> 02:50:34.782
MATT: You can see her shiver at the door and then
just run out. "Goodbye! Take care!" (ping)

02:50:34.782 --> 02:50:39.512
Something shoots off. "Oh, damn it." As you all
leave and exit out, she's out there fuming outside.

02:50:39.512 --> 02:50:40.913
SAM: He's adorable.

02:50:40.913 --> 02:50:42.639
MATT: "He's something. He's certainly something."

02:50:42.639 --> 02:50:46.060
MARISHA: As we leave, I grab the bolt that he shot
into the wall over Caleb's head.

02:50:46.060 --> 02:50:48.779
MATT: Okay. You pocketed a bolt.

02:50:48.779 --> 02:50:51.589
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and LIAM: Pocket a bolt.

02:50:51.589 --> 02:50:56.420
TRAVIS: So Lasagna, should we try and find our way
over to the--

02:50:56.420 --> 02:50:58.195
LAURA: Steelbringer's Forge?

02:50:58.195 --> 02:51:03.011
MATT: "Right. Come on, I'll lead you over to where
the boys are. You going to rough them up again?"

02:51:03.011 --> 02:51:04.839
LAURA: They're only a couple blocks away?

02:51:04.839 --> 02:51:06.880
MATT: "Right. Just right around the corner. Come
on, I'll show you."

02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:08.861
LAURA: Should I try casting it again?

02:51:08.861 --> 02:51:09.886
SAM: Yes.

02:51:09.886 --> 02:51:11.073
TRAVIS: Wait a minute.

02:51:11.073 --> 02:51:12.408
TALIESIN: Not yet.

02:51:12.408 --> 02:51:14.778
MARISHA: As we walk over there, I say: Hey,
Rissa.

02:51:14.778 --> 02:51:16.267
MATT: "Aye."

02:51:16.267 --> 02:51:20.129
MARISHA: You got a good dad. He really loves you.

02:51:20.129 --> 02:51:29.048
MATT: "I know. He's just... he's difficult at
times. It's hard to scrape under a family name

02:51:29.048 --> 02:51:30.911
"when it's been through the ringer."

02:51:30.911 --> 02:51:35.646
MARISHA: Sometimes family names aren't all that
they're cracked up to be.

02:51:35.646 --> 02:51:41.755
MATT: She gives you a look over. "I agree."

02:51:41.755 --> 02:51:48.086
MARISHA: What's more important is that he really
cares for you. Don't take that for granted, all

02:51:48.086 --> 02:51:51.236
right? And I slap her on the back and keep
walking.

02:51:51.236 --> 02:51:58.318
LAURA: Yeah, and the fact that you know him is
really cool, too. Anyway.

02:51:58.318 --> 02:52:01.569
SAM: Wow, so many daddy issues.

02:52:01.569 --> 02:52:06.237
MARISHA: I was going to say, me and Jester hold
hands and we skip off.

02:52:06.237 --> 02:52:12.094
MATT: You guys are led down past a few buildings
and then around the corner, and while most of the

02:52:12.094 --> 02:52:19.276
heavy metalworks is done down below on the ground
floor of the base of the mountain, the more

02:52:19.276 --> 02:52:23.838
refined metalworks are done up here on the Shelf.
As you approach, you can already see the

02:52:23.838 --> 02:52:30.889
Steelbringer's Forge, which has a number of
shields and swords on display, armor bits, and you

02:52:30.889 --> 02:52:36.639
can see simple tools are crafted here. As you
step, already looking into the main chamber door--

02:52:36.639 --> 02:52:40.084
which is open, because it's so hot in there, they
have to keep a breeze going through-- there are

02:52:40.084 --> 02:52:45.308
two forges going at any given point in time. There
are two anvils set up. You see a few gnomes at

02:52:45.308 --> 02:52:49.700
work and indeed, both Fitz and Ashton are both
working as assistants. They're not actually

02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:54.735
banging the hammer, but they're both helping move
things and quenching into the water and then

02:52:54.735 --> 02:52:59.770
helping gather materials and holding the metal and
rotating it on the anvil as their bosses are

02:52:59.770 --> 02:53:02.780
hammering down. They don't seem to notice your
arrival.

02:53:02.780 --> 02:53:08.500
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like
whispers of Infernal all around them.

02:53:08.500 --> 02:53:12.577
MATT: (hammering)

02:53:12.577 --> 02:53:16.238
ALL: (speaking Infernal)

02:53:16.238 --> 02:53:24.398
MATT: "Hold back, boys!" There is one male gnome
and one female dwarf that are both sitting there,

02:53:24.398 --> 02:53:28.070
grabbing their nearby warhammers, look around.
They look over and see the shadows in the corner.

02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:32.861
"What beast brings their way into our workplace?
Name yourself!"

02:53:32.861 --> 02:53:34.750
LAURA: Oh hi!

02:53:34.750 --> 02:53:46.747
MATT: They look at each other. The dwarf female
goes (hammering) back to work. You see the two

02:53:46.747 --> 02:53:52.247
assistants look over and go-- and put their heads
down and keep focused on their work. The gnome

02:53:52.247 --> 02:53:57.009
says, "Just take a break. Hi, can we help you?"

02:53:57.009 --> 02:54:01.013
TALIESIN: We're here to talk to those two.

02:54:01.013 --> 02:54:08.033
MATT: "What did you do?" He slaps with a cloth,
and the assistant's like, "Ah! I didn't-- gah!"

02:54:08.033 --> 02:54:09.922
"What did the boys do? What'd they do?"

02:54:09.922 --> 02:54:14.849
LAURA: They might have been party to a crime, we
don't know. We're investigators.

02:54:14.849 --> 02:54:22.671
MATT: You can see across the way Ashton's like,
(gasps) and the dwarf goes, "Well then, best go

02:54:22.671 --> 02:54:27.322
"talk to them." Gives them a little kick to the
side, and they both take their hammers down. They

02:54:27.322 --> 02:54:31.763
take the metal off and put it back in the forge to
heat, and they both rest and cross their arms and

02:54:31.763 --> 02:54:38.616
watch. The two boys look at each other and
sheepishly step forward. "Hi, miss. What can we

02:54:38.616 --> 02:54:41.607
"do? What are you asking about?" "Yeah, what can we
do?"

02:54:41.607 --> 02:54:44.028
MARISHA: We talk in here, or are we going to take
them outside?

02:54:44.028 --> 02:54:53.089
MATT: Rissa goes, "I don't know. Kind of like to
do it in a place of business, that way we can keep

02:54:53.089 --> 02:54:55.215
"it above the board, you know?"

02:54:55.215 --> 02:55:01.205
TRAVIS: Indeed. I'm sure their employers are not
fond of thieves in their midst.

02:55:01.205 --> 02:55:05.447
MARISHA: I look back at the boys and I say: Sit
the fuck down.

02:55:05.447 --> 02:55:07.058
TRAVIS: Ooh, it's on!

02:55:07.058 --> 02:55:10.076
MATT: They both grab nearby stools and sit down.

02:55:10.076 --> 02:55:18.236
MARISHA: Here's the deal. This guy's super fucking
charming. He's going to talk to you first. You

02:55:18.236 --> 02:55:20.830
don't want to talk to me.

02:55:20.830 --> 02:55:22.329
SAM: She's not charming.

02:55:22.329 --> 02:55:23.366
LAURA: At all.

02:55:23.366 --> 02:55:24.686
TALIESIN: In the least.

02:55:24.686 --> 02:55:25.867
MARISHA: Deal?

02:55:25.867 --> 02:55:28.591
MATT: "Deal." "Deal."

02:55:28.591 --> 02:55:30.919
MARISHA: My man Fjord is up!

02:55:30.919 --> 02:55:37.965
LIAM: I wave my hands a little bit and say, "I
suggest you help this one find the things that we

02:55:37.965 --> 02:55:40.224
"are looking for," and I cast Suggest.

02:55:40.224 --> 02:55:42.582
MATT: What's the DC on that?

02:55:42.582 --> 02:55:47.277
LIAM: That is 16, wisdom.

02:55:47.277 --> 02:55:49.917
SAM: On one of them or both?

02:55:49.917 --> 02:55:50.890
LIAM: One of them.

02:55:50.890 --> 02:55:52.368
MATT: Which one, Ashton or Fitz?

02:55:52.368 --> 02:55:53.531
LIAM: Fitz.

02:55:53.531 --> 02:55:55.686
TRAVIS: Yeah, Fitz did seem like a prick, didn't
he?

02:55:55.686 --> 02:55:57.585
TALIESIN: I like that it was not even a question.

02:55:57.585 --> 02:56:04.296
MATT: Fitz looks at you and goes-- and looks right
to Fjord, the spell seemingly taking effect.

02:56:04.296 --> 02:56:07.887
MARISHA: I crack my knuckles, intimidate them a
bit from behind.

02:56:07.887 --> 02:56:13.686
TRAVIS: Fitz, I understand that you might have
felt a little slighted by last night's encounter.

02:56:13.686 --> 02:56:16.391
MATT: "Oh, no, you know, I'm just--"

02:56:16.391 --> 02:56:21.685
TRAVIS: I didn't say you could talk. What I want
to know is, when you came back into the bar last

02:56:21.685 --> 02:56:27.311
night, did you see fit to rummage your way through
some good, hard-working people's coin purses?

02:56:27.311 --> 02:56:31.629
MATT: His eyes go wide. "No, not at all, no. What?
I wouldn't. I earn my money."

02:56:31.629 --> 02:56:33.786
TRAVIS: How about your friend Ashton over there?

02:56:33.786 --> 02:56:38.347
MATT: Ashton looks back. "No, sir, we were just
looking-- we were just joshing, we were just

02:56:38.347 --> 02:56:39.906
"playing with Rissa, that was all!"

02:56:39.906 --> 02:56:43.740
MARISHA: I pull out my staff. Do a cool little
flourish.

02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:47.844
TRAVIS: See, now we're in a dangerous territory,
because once that staff comes out, she's got to

02:56:47.844 --> 02:56:52.800
hit something with it, and it's not going to be
me. Listen, Fitz. The best thing you can do here

02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:59.675
is wrack your brain real hard, and think: have
you ever seen anyone around that establishment

02:56:59.675 --> 02:57:03.815
that might take advantage of some people enjoying
some good imbibements?

02:57:03.815 --> 02:57:06.882
MATT: (whimpering)

02:57:06.882 --> 02:57:08.854
TRAVIS: Oh, Fitz. Tick tock, tick tock.

02:57:08.854 --> 02:57:12.121
MATT: "I don't know! Maybe, um--"

02:57:12.121 --> 02:57:14.291
MARISHA: I take a few steps forward.

02:57:14.291 --> 02:57:15.859
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:57:15.859 --> 02:57:17.189
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:57:17.189 --> 02:57:20.211
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus. It's not really my strong
suit.

02:57:20.211 --> 02:57:21.806
TRAVIS: I know, it's mine.

02:57:21.806 --> 02:57:23.915
MATT: I'll let you both make one, because you're
doing it together.

02:57:23.915 --> 02:57:29.301
MARISHA: Oh, that's not too bad. 13?

02:57:29.301 --> 02:57:30.835
TRAVIS: 16.

02:57:30.835 --> 02:57:38.400
MATT: They both look at each other and like,
(stuttering) "There are probably some people who

02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:43.686
"could've taken things. I don't know. There are
shady folk in there all the time! We don't have

02:57:43.686 --> 02:57:47.400
"your money! I swear I didn't do anything!"
(sobbing)

02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:49.090
TRAVIS: We're making kids cry. This is amazing.

02:57:49.090 --> 02:57:55.864
MATT: Ashton's like, "Come on! Get it together!"
and kicks him and is like, "We're being completely

02:57:55.864 --> 02:58:03.689
"honest. We saw nothing, we took nothing. We were
just getting our rocks off freaking people out,

02:58:03.689 --> 02:58:05.622
"and then we went back and got some drinks."

02:58:05.622 --> 02:58:08.621
TRAVIS: You don't know anyone else that has made a
habit of doing this regularly, then?

02:58:08.621 --> 02:58:13.063
MATT: "Not personally, no. Most of them end up in
the Gearhold."

02:58:13.116 --> 02:58:16.391
SAM: Should I pour this vial of acid on them?

02:58:16.391 --> 02:58:17.980
MATT: (screaming)

02:58:17.980 --> 02:58:20.981
TRAVIS: You might get it ready, Nott. I feel like
we're not getting anywhere here.

02:58:20.981 --> 02:58:23.486
LAURA: You know where Ol' Blemmy is from?

02:58:23.486 --> 02:58:29.807
MATT: They both look at each other. "Well,
originally, he used to be an ice sailor up north,

02:58:29.807 --> 02:58:31.801
"by Ice Haven, but he retired ten years ago."

02:58:31.801 --> 02:58:33.024
SAM: No! Now! Where does he live now?

02:58:33.024 --> 02:58:34.183
MATT: "I don't know!"

02:58:34.183 --> 02:58:42.484
SAM: By the way, ice sailor sounds like the
coolest job. What does that even mean?

02:58:42.484 --> 02:58:47.640
MATT: Ice sailor would be a person that forges the
frozen depths up north.

02:58:47.640 --> 02:58:48.980
LAURA: Whoa!

02:58:48.980 --> 02:58:55.206
MATT: The people you see on The Deadliest Catch?
It's that kind of a job.

02:58:55.206 --> 02:58:57.560
SAM: Mixed with Ice Road Truckers?

02:58:57.560 --> 02:58:58.843
MATT: Sure.

02:58:58.843 --> 02:59:05.742
TRAVIS: Fitz, I'm going to talk to my colleague
here. If you move, Beau is going to take your head

02:59:05.742 --> 02:59:11.497
off. Don't. Move. (whispering) Okay, we got them
right where we want them. Just fucking act like

02:59:11.497 --> 02:59:14.068
you don't like what I'm saying. Look agitated.

02:59:14.068 --> 02:59:15.246
MARISHA: Okay.

02:59:15.246 --> 02:59:19.808
TRAVIS: Look more agitated, right now. More
grimace. Give me nostrils. Nasolabial fold. Really

02:59:19.808 --> 02:59:24.822
work it. There it goes. (louder) All right. I
talked to her, Fitz. Listen, she will stay her

02:59:24.822 --> 02:59:31.065
staff if, in the next 24 hours, you work your ass
off and you find out who took our money.

02:59:31.065 --> 02:59:32.342
MATT: "Okay, okay."

02:59:32.342 --> 02:59:34.410
MARISHA: God, my staff is just vibrating--

02:59:34.410 --> 02:59:36.149
TRAVIS: Easy, Beau. Remember what you said!

02:59:36.149 --> 02:59:37.508
MARISHA: I don't know about this, Fjord!

02:59:37.508 --> 02:59:41.369
TRAVIS: This is not going to go well for you
unless you can produce some results.

02:59:41.369 --> 02:59:44.935
MATT: He looks to Ashton. Ashton's like, "Okay!
(stuttering) No, we'll ask around! We'll do--

02:59:44.935 --> 02:59:53.702
"that's okay! When the bosses-- " "You can look
when you're done with the forge. When the whistles

02:59:53.702 --> 02:59:55.785
"blow? Have at it."

02:59:55.785 --> 03:00:00.123
LIAM: Fitz, I suggested that you do everything in
your power to help my friend Fjord, and for the

03:00:00.123 --> 03:00:02.194
next eight hours, that is what you will do.

03:00:02.194 --> 03:00:08.430
MATT: Fitz is like, "I have to work! It's my
livelihood!"

03:00:08.430 --> 03:00:14.063
TRAVIS: Well, if you got to work, you got even
less time. Better be motivated.

03:00:14.063 --> 03:00:21.680
MARISHA: You know, in this case, I would weigh
between your livelihood and your life. Can't have

03:00:21.680 --> 03:00:23.520
one without the other.

03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:27.796
LAURA: Oh no. You guys, you guys.

03:00:27.796 --> 03:00:30.281
SAM: What? What's wrong?

03:00:30.281 --> 03:00:33.286
MATT: Their spirits are pretty crushed right now,
and they're both like--

03:00:33.286 --> 03:00:34.746
LAURA: They're going to get fired.

03:00:34.746 --> 03:00:37.901
SAM: You feel bad?

03:00:37.901 --> 03:00:39.111
LAURA: I do.

03:00:39.111 --> 03:00:42.851
LIAM: How much do these young men make in a day
here?

03:00:42.851 --> 03:00:50.688
MATT: They both look at each other. "On a good
day? We give them about a gold for a day's work."

03:00:50.688 --> 03:01:00.680
LIAM: I want this one, particularly, working now.
Why don't we stake their salary for the day? We

03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:08.335
take care of that, double it even. We need these
two. We pay for the loss of their work today?

03:01:08.335 --> 03:01:15.114
MATT: They nod. The gnome steps forward, takes the
coin, if you present it.

03:01:15.114 --> 03:01:16.497
SAM: We don't have any.

03:01:16.497 --> 03:01:18.931
LAURA: Oh god, guys!

03:01:18.931 --> 03:01:26.977
MATT: That's four gold, so that's three of them
for the two gold. He goes, "Okay, you boys go get

03:01:26.977 --> 03:01:30.157
"your work done here and we'll find some
replacements, and you hope they aren't better than

03:01:30.157 --> 03:01:34.888
"you are." The boys are like, "Yes! Yes, sir!"
"Yes, sir!"

03:01:34.888 --> 03:01:40.327
MARISHA: I crack my staff on the floor and I say:
Get fucking moving, then!

03:01:40.327 --> 03:01:42.722
MATT: They get up and grab their stuff and then
dart out into the street.

03:01:42.722 --> 03:01:43.990
TRAVIS: Excellent.

03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:46.192
SAM: Should I shoot them down while they run?

03:01:46.192 --> 03:01:47.429
TALIESIN: Not yet.

03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:49.749
MATT: The two forge workers--

03:01:49.749 --> 03:01:51.073
TALIESIN: Now.

03:01:51.073 --> 03:01:57.123
MATT: There's a pause, like the two workers at the
forge look at each other and look at you guys and

03:01:57.123 --> 03:02:06.572
go (laughs). "I'm not going to lie, those boys are
going to be pissing their pants for a week after

03:02:06.572 --> 03:02:08.608
"that. That was enjoyable."

03:02:08.608 --> 03:02:09.887
TRAVIS: Yeah, might scare them straight.

03:02:09.887 --> 03:02:15.648
MATT: "I hope so. They need it. They're a couple
of pissants. Anyway, we've got to go find some

03:02:15.648 --> 03:02:19.401
"replacements, but thank you for helping out with
the transition, at least."

03:02:19.401 --> 03:02:20.523
TRAVIS: It's our pleasure.

03:02:20.523 --> 03:02:23.157
TALIESIN: We hate to bother you, also, but we did
actually get robbed, and if you have any idea

03:02:23.157 --> 03:02:25.923
where we should start looking to actually--

03:02:25.923 --> 03:02:28.437
SAM: Everyone. Everywhere.

03:02:28.437 --> 03:02:39.155
MATT: They both look at each other and be like,
"Maybe ask down at the Assembly Yard? There's a

03:02:39.155 --> 03:02:41.141
"bunch of weird folks that wander down there."

03:02:41.141 --> 03:02:42.641
TALIESIN: I like weird folks.

03:02:42.641 --> 03:02:48.639
MATT: "Lifelong industrial hammer workers. Not a
lot of craft and skill. Mind gets a bit addled."

03:02:48.639 --> 03:02:50.310
TALIESIN: Bless you.

03:02:50.310 --> 03:02:52.001
LAURA: Thank you.

03:02:52.001 --> 03:02:55.741
MATT: "Of course. Anyway, we've got to go get back
to work."

03:02:55.741 --> 03:02:57.423
TRAVIS: We take our leave.

03:02:57.423 --> 03:02:58.794
MATT: You guys wander outside?

03:02:58.794 --> 03:03:09.242
SAM: On the way out, can I just ask that gentleman:
Do you make any of those things that we've seen

03:03:09.242 --> 03:03:10.592
around here?

03:03:10.592 --> 03:03:11.673
TALIESIN: Scissors?

03:03:11.673 --> 03:03:12.739
LIAM: Octopi?

03:03:12.739 --> 03:03:16.853
SAM: (stammering) The pistols. Do you make those
here?

03:03:16.853 --> 03:03:22.340
MATT: "Oh, no. We don't specialize in firearms.
Those are all regulated by the Empire. Those are

03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:24.121
"designed down in the Assembly Yard."

03:03:24.121 --> 03:03:26.893
SAM: Oh. Thank you. Good day.

03:03:26.893 --> 03:03:32.546
MATT: Or that would be the Iron Lot is where that
would be made.

03:03:32.546 --> 03:03:33.706
SAM: The Iron Lot.

03:03:33.706 --> 03:03:38.545
TRAVIS: Yeah, when we were in there, the shields and
swords, they looked fairly standard, or were there

03:03:38.595 --> 03:03:40.546
some that were like "holy shit!"?

03:03:40.546 --> 03:03:46.079
MATT: No, they seemed pretty standard. I mean,
well-made. Looks like a lot of places like this

03:03:46.079 --> 03:03:50.862
are in the process of developing weaponry, not
just for home use, but probably sending it out for

03:03:50.862 --> 03:03:51.913
the field.

03:03:51.913 --> 03:03:55.625
TRAVIS: Yeah. Rissa, how far are we from this
Assembly Yard?

03:03:55.625 --> 03:04:03.212
MATT: She goes, "The Assembly Yard is down in the
bottom half of the city, so it's say about an

03:04:03.212 --> 03:04:04.715
"hour, hour and a half walk?"

03:04:04.715 --> 03:04:08.403
TRAVIS: And just out of curiosity, the Silver
Falls, the residential area, how far is that?

03:04:08.403 --> 03:04:13.062
MATT: "Well, that's that way, about 25 minutes to
get to the actual Falls themselves, and you see

03:04:13.062 --> 03:04:17.844
"all the little towers over there, those are where
all the homes are assembled in that place."

03:04:17.844 --> 03:04:22.345
TRAVIS: Ol' Blemmy's over in the Silver Falls,
that residential area. Do we want to go there, or--

03:04:22.345 --> 03:04:24.345
SAM: Our list of suspects is as follows!

03:04:24.345 --> 03:04:25.762
TRAVIS: (softly) Oh, shit.

03:04:25.762 --> 03:04:30.456
SAM: The pianist! Blemmy! Rissa! The girl!

03:04:30.456 --> 03:04:33.605
LAURA: The little girl that was asking for money.

03:04:33.605 --> 03:04:39.643
SAM: Fitz and Ashton! We've eliminated as possible
suspects: Fitz and Ashton, really, they're really

03:04:39.643 --> 03:04:42.503
lame. The pianist!

03:04:42.503 --> 03:04:43.781
LAURA: Why?

03:04:43.781 --> 03:04:46.241
SAM: Because you did Locate Object within his--

03:04:46.241 --> 03:04:48.249
LAURA: You're right, that's true, we did do that.

03:04:48.249 --> 03:04:50.500
SAM: Rissa! Because she was in Zone of Truth.

03:04:50.500 --> 03:04:51.490
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:04:51.490 --> 03:04:52.754
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:04:52.754 --> 03:04:56.008
SAM: That leaves our suspects Blemmy! And the
girl.

03:04:56.008 --> 03:05:01.349
TRAVIS: But we have no leads on the girl, correct?
No one saw her, knows her name--

03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:02.992
MARISHA: Blemmy might know the girl.

03:05:02.992 --> 03:05:07.196
LAURA: I saw her. But I did not ask her name.

03:05:07.196 --> 03:05:11.299
SAM: But! She has your copper pieces!

03:05:11.299 --> 03:05:13.943
LAURA: I gave her silver!

03:05:13.943 --> 03:05:15.251
TRAVIS: You did.

03:05:15.251 --> 03:05:22.945
SAM: You did! Could you find those specific
silver pieces? Or the money she stole from us.

03:05:22.945 --> 03:05:26.535
TRAVIS: Do you bite your silver pieces before you
put them in your coin purse?

03:05:26.535 --> 03:05:27.808
MARISHA: Did you lick it?

03:05:27.808 --> 03:05:32.993
LAURA: I don't. But I do draw dicks on a lot of my
money. But I don't think I did it to those.

03:05:32.993 --> 03:05:34.750
TRAVIS: Like, little tiny dicks?

03:05:34.750 --> 03:05:36.298
LAURA: Well, I have really good paint, you know.

03:05:36.298 --> 03:05:38.242
SAM: So we go find Blemmy!

03:05:38.242 --> 03:05:39.362
TRAVIS: Silver Falls.

03:05:39.362 --> 03:05:40.514
LAURA: Yeah.

03:05:40.514 --> 03:05:45.646
SAM: Silver Falls. That's the residential area.
Where the finger towers apartments are.

03:05:45.646 --> 03:05:49.683
TALIESIN: We can keep asking, has anyone had
anything purchased--

03:05:49.736 --> 03:05:51.984
LAURA: That was a lot of money!

03:05:51.984 --> 03:05:53.344
TALIESIN: With dicks on it.

03:05:53.344 --> 03:05:56.043
LAURA: That, too. No, wait, because they didn't
steal my money.

03:05:56.043 --> 03:05:57.573
TRAVIS: If there was a way to ask about--

03:05:57.573 --> 03:06:00.216
LAURA: I have a whole pouch full of money, you
guys, right here.

03:06:00.216 --> 03:06:02.606
TRAVIS: If you could ask about large purchases,
that would be a good idea.

03:06:02.606 --> 03:06:04.069
LAURA: Big pouch.

03:06:04.069 --> 03:06:05.901
TRAVIS: Silver Falls?

03:06:05.901 --> 03:06:07.259
SAM: Silver Falls!

03:06:07.259 --> 03:06:13.247
SAM, MATT, and LAURA: (singing to tune of Silver
Bells) Silver Falls...

03:06:13.247 --> 03:06:16.428
MATT: With Rissa guiding you guys back, you manage
to make your way outside of the main Idle Shelf

03:06:16.428 --> 03:06:20.965
area and in towards the cluster of the Silver
Falls. As you approach, you can see the beautiful,

03:06:20.965 --> 03:06:27.484
very wide waterfall that cascades down about a
thousand feet, across the mountainside, until

03:06:27.484 --> 03:06:32.888
eventually it falls into this large lake, where
you can see columns of steam are rising up. The

03:06:32.888 --> 03:06:38.240
closer you get, you begin to realize that there is an
element of this lake, this waterfall, and some

03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:43.548
sort of a steam engine-type mechanism built into
the surrounding rock that they use to fuel

03:06:43.548 --> 03:06:49.290
probably the furnaces and elements of the
technology within this city. As you begin to hit

03:06:49.290 --> 03:06:55.051
the residential area, you can see these large,
somewhat crooked-looking towers that themselves

03:06:55.051 --> 03:07:02.857
are maybe what would be the equivalent of 1500- to
1000-square-foot apartments, but stacked four or

03:07:02.857 --> 03:07:09.246
five on top of each other, with spiraling stairs
on the outside to go to each level. There aren't a

03:07:09.246 --> 03:07:13.426
lot of folks currently at home, other than
stay-at-home dads or moms that are watching

03:07:13.426 --> 03:07:17.775
children, some folks that are putting out laundry
on lines that are connecting between multiple

03:07:17.775 --> 03:07:23.888
towers and are dangling up two or three stories
above the street. But they're all made of dark

03:07:23.888 --> 03:07:33.924
irons and blacker metals, so it gives the district
this very weirdly-- what's the word I'm looking

03:07:33.924 --> 03:07:40.208
for? A whimsical Industrial Revolution feel. It's
a unique mixture.

03:07:40.208 --> 03:07:41.857
LAURA: Dr. Seuss meets--

03:07:41.857 --> 03:07:49.051
MATT: Kind of. Or a hint of Howl's Moving Castle
in places. There's also that spray of the

03:07:49.051 --> 03:07:53.317
waterfall hitting the lake behind, which gives
occasionally this light misting of water through

03:07:53.317 --> 03:07:57.764
the air. You can see faint bits of rainbow that
come through where the mist hits the sunlight as

03:07:57.764 --> 03:08:00.764
it makes its way across the waterfall spray.

03:08:00.764 --> 03:08:04.302
LAURA: You said the waterfall goes up a thousand
feet.

03:08:04.302 --> 03:08:05.270
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:08:05.270 --> 03:08:06.792
LAURA: And the apartments don't go as high as
that.

03:08:06.792 --> 03:08:07.971
MATT: No, not at all.

03:08:07.971 --> 03:08:13.702
LAURA: So if I got in the middle of the area and
cast Locate Object, it would do a really big

03:08:13.702 --> 03:08:16.290
radius. It would reach at least the top of the
buildings.

03:08:16.290 --> 03:08:19.015
MATT: Oh yeah, very much so.

03:08:19.015 --> 03:08:21.460
SAM: Let's go.

03:08:21.460 --> 03:08:22.655
LAURA: Okay.

03:08:22.655 --> 03:08:27.567
MATT: Okay. As you make your way through, you're
not entirely sure where Ol' Blemmy is, but you

03:08:27.567 --> 03:08:30.410
make your way towards where the middle, Rissa
says, of the district is--

03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:35.982
TRAVIS: Keeping an eye out for old, craggly
sailor-types.

03:08:35.982 --> 03:08:38.553
MATT: Sure. Make a perception check.

03:08:38.553 --> 03:08:40.516
TRAVIS: Me? Yep.

03:08:40.516 --> 03:08:42.708
LAURA: Should I cast Locate Object while we're
walking around?

03:08:42.708 --> 03:08:44.018
LIAM: In a center spot?

03:08:44.018 --> 03:08:45.606
SAM: Will you be able to cast it again?

03:08:45.606 --> 03:08:46.888
TRAVIS: Eight.

03:08:46.888 --> 03:08:50.407
LAURA: Yeah. I mean, if I use up all my spells
today as like, this kind of thing.

03:08:50.407 --> 03:08:52.076
SAM: Why did you--

03:08:52.076 --> 03:08:55.076
MATT: It's a 2nd-level spell. Do you want to cast
it again or not?

03:08:55.076 --> 03:08:56.164
LAURA: I can.

03:08:56.164 --> 03:08:58.536
SAM: Just while we stroll through the town?

03:08:58.536 --> 03:09:00.457
MARISHA: Through the residential district.

03:09:00.457 --> 03:09:05.320
SAM: Sure. I guess. What are you searching for?

03:09:05.320 --> 03:09:07.629
LAURA: The drinking coins, right?

03:09:07.629 --> 03:09:09.286
LIAM: Yeah, the tokens.

03:09:09.286 --> 03:09:10.263
MATT: The tokens?

03:09:10.263 --> 03:09:11.939
MARISHA: I think it's the best way to go.

03:09:11.939 --> 03:09:13.250
LAURA: Cast spell.

03:09:13.306 --> 03:09:17.047
MATT: Okay, you cast Locate Object. You
concentrate and focus, extending your

03:09:17.047 --> 03:09:22.097
consciousness, focusing on one of these wooden
tokens, the one that was won by one of the members

03:09:22.097 --> 03:09:31.513
of your party. (pop) You get a blip behind you.
Not quite in the district, but right where the

03:09:31.513 --> 03:09:36.547
Idleworks Shelf transitions into the residential
area on the Idleworks Shelf. You get (boop).

03:09:36.547 --> 03:09:40.837
LAURA: (gasps) Ah! I turn around and start running
towards it.

03:09:40.837 --> 03:09:43.710
SAM: Follow her! She's a bloodhound!

03:09:43.710 --> 03:09:46.055
TRAVIS: Throwing up while we do it.

03:09:46.055 --> 03:09:52.195
MATT: You guys dart after Jester, making your way
down the road, running, (panting). You're closing

03:09:52.195 --> 03:09:57.135
the distance. You weave through a couple
buildings. You're out of the residential part of

03:09:57.135 --> 03:10:01.282
the district again and you're back into the Idle
Shelf, but on the very back end of it. There's

03:10:01.282 --> 03:10:05.532
warehouses and there's small buildings, and
eventually, you come to the destination and it

03:10:05.532 --> 03:10:12.834
looks like it's a small building. There's a sign
out front that just says, "Butcher." And it's

03:10:12.834 --> 03:10:14.135
boarded up.

03:10:14.135 --> 03:10:16.969
TRAVIS: Yep. That motherfucker had leather apron
with shitty-ass sleeves.

03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:18.469
MARISHA: He totally fucking did.

03:10:18.469 --> 03:10:19.917
SAM: Was it Blemmy?

03:10:19.917 --> 03:10:22.387
MARISHA: No, it was the guy with the nasty fucking
beard.

03:10:22.387 --> 03:10:26.586
SAM: They all had nasty beards. Duncan, Valkin,
Ruth, and Tanya.

03:10:26.586 --> 03:10:27.783
LAURA: It was Duncan!

03:10:27.783 --> 03:10:30.424
MARISHA: Duncan! That was his name! Right, the guy
that you drank across?

03:10:30.424 --> 03:10:33.425
LIAM: We should probably keep our voices down in
the street--

03:10:33.425 --> 03:10:34.710
TRAVIS: Let's turn it down.

03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:36.192
MARISHA: Wait, was Duncan the nerdy guy?

03:10:36.192 --> 03:10:40.738
SAM: The first guy was Duncan. Valkin was the next
guy.

03:10:40.738 --> 03:10:44.346
LAURA: Valkin was the guy that fought Caleb. Okay,
let's go. Should we just go in?

03:10:44.346 --> 03:10:46.957
TRAVIS: No. Who's going to guard the back?

03:10:46.957 --> 03:10:49.094
SAM: Oh, we're going to circle around?

03:10:49.094 --> 03:10:51.654
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! If she's getting a beacon.

03:10:51.654 --> 03:10:55.227
MATT: You see Kiri pulls out her knife and goes,
(like Jester) "I can send a message."

03:10:55.227 --> 03:11:03.465
TRAVIS: Oh no. No, Kiri, this is where we're
stealthy, all right? Knife goes away. Shh. Nice.

03:11:03.465 --> 03:11:05.099
MATT: (like Fjord) "Shh. Nice"

03:11:05.099 --> 03:11:06.661
LIAM: Do we want to send Nott or a cat in?

03:11:06.661 --> 03:11:08.795
MARISHA: Is there a roof to this thing?

03:11:08.795 --> 03:11:10.047
MATT: There is a roof, yeah.

03:11:10.047 --> 03:11:11.115
TRAVIS: Two story? One story?

03:11:11.115 --> 03:11:18.170
MATT: It's one story. It's not a huge building.
It's maybe three rooms?

03:11:18.170 --> 03:11:19.964
MARISHA: I parkour on the roof.

03:11:19.964 --> 03:11:21.585
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

03:11:21.585 --> 03:11:23.266
SAM: No, wait. Can we surround it first? Jesus.

03:11:23.266 --> 03:11:24.575
MATT: She's already up.

03:11:24.575 --> 03:11:25.971
TRAVIS: She hops up there, I run around the back.

03:11:25.971 --> 03:11:26.957
MATT: Okay.

03:11:26.957 --> 03:11:28.023
SAM: We surround the building.

03:11:28.023 --> 03:11:29.159
LAURA: I'm going to stay in the front.

03:11:29.159 --> 03:11:30.918
MARISHA: Ooh! 25.

03:11:30.918 --> 03:11:33.387
MATT: All right. You guys surround it. (landing
footfalls)

03:11:33.387 --> 03:11:37.832
MARISHA: Are there any chimneys? Soft spots in the
floor? Skylights?

03:11:37.832 --> 03:11:47.558
MATT: There isn't a skylight, per se, but you do
see there is a little smokestack that's about

03:11:47.558 --> 03:11:50.050
three feet wide or so. Two and a half feet wide.

03:11:50.050 --> 03:11:53.284
MARISHA: I'm going to peek in. Can I see down?

03:11:53.284 --> 03:11:54.817
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:11:54.817 --> 03:12:02.574
MARISHA: (fake coughs) Okay. 14.

03:12:02.574 --> 03:12:09.536
MATT: 14. Glancing inside, it's dark, except for
you can see the little beams of sunlight that are

03:12:09.536 --> 03:12:11.874
coming through the slats of wood on the roof.

03:12:11.874 --> 03:12:13.119
MARISHA: Goggles.

03:12:13.119 --> 03:12:18.922
MATT: Glancing inside, looking through, you can
see four figures in there that are currently not

03:12:18.922 --> 03:12:22.650
moving and they're all clustered together in the
far corner.

03:12:22.650 --> 03:12:24.007
MARISHA: What do they look like?

03:12:24.007 --> 03:12:25.511
MATT: They look gnome in size.

03:12:25.511 --> 03:12:29.586
MARISHA: Okay. They're just huddled together, you
said?

03:12:29.586 --> 03:12:31.096
MATT: They're huddled together, and they're not
moving.

03:12:31.096 --> 03:12:33.248
SAM: I will take out my wire and--

03:12:33.248 --> 03:12:37.171
MATT: You look and they're starting to look
around, like they might have heard a noise.

03:12:37.171 --> 03:12:41.920
SAM: I whisper to Beau using Message, "What do you
see? You can reply to this message."

03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:46.801
MARISHA: (whispers) Four individuals. Huddled
around. They're either the assholes or hostages,

03:12:46.801 --> 03:12:47.994
it's hard to say.

03:12:47.994 --> 03:12:52.219
LAURA: (whispers) Should we all go in at the same
time? Oh you can't hear me; we're not Messaging

03:12:52.219 --> 03:12:53.102
together.

03:12:53.102 --> 03:12:54.075
SAM: No.

03:12:54.075 --> 03:12:55.573
LAURA: (whispers) I'm just talking to myself.

03:12:55.573 --> 03:12:58.776
MARISHA: Hey, I'm going to--

03:12:58.776 --> 03:13:00.572
SAM: We don't know what you're doing.

03:13:00.572 --> 03:13:03.195
TRAVIS: Is there a door or a window on the back at
all, or is it just like--?

03:13:03.195 --> 03:13:08.603
MATT: No, there's a door in the front, and a door
at the back. The door in the front is like a

03:13:08.603 --> 03:13:13.938
sectional door, a top and a bottom, looks like it
can be opened separately to sell out or wants to

03:13:13.938 --> 03:13:18.238
bring and sell meat over that side. The back is
just a general door; it looks almost like a

03:13:18.238 --> 03:13:20.017
storage space or a back entry to it.

03:13:20.017 --> 03:13:21.246
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

03:13:21.302 --> 03:13:22.204
LIAM: No open windows?

03:13:22.204 --> 03:13:23.202
SAM: Should we draw them out?

03:13:23.202 --> 03:13:24.395
MATT: There are windows, but they're boarded
over.

03:13:24.395 --> 03:13:28.212
SAM: We're just going to bust in? What if they
have traps and bombs?

03:13:28.212 --> 03:13:33.349
MARISHA: I'm going to very gingerly lean over the
edge of the roof where Fjord is. I'm going to say:

03:13:33.349 --> 03:13:36.642
(whispers) On the boom!

03:13:36.642 --> 03:13:38.103
TRAVIS: (whispers) Okay.

03:13:38.103 --> 03:13:42.955
MARISHA: I'm going to go back over to the chimney
very gingerly, pull out one of the firecrackers,

03:13:42.955 --> 03:13:47.439
one of the bottle rockets, light it with the
tinderbox, and drop it in.

03:13:47.439 --> 03:13:48.576
TRAVIS: Awesome!

03:13:48.576 --> 03:13:52.648
MARISHA: Is the chimney wide enough for me to fit
in? Santa Claus-style?

03:13:52.648 --> 03:13:54.708
MATT: You can try, yeah. You can certainly try.

03:13:54.708 --> 03:13:58.173
LIAM: There was a back door, too?

03:13:58.173 --> 03:13:59.835
TRAVIS: Front door, back door.

03:13:59.835 --> 03:14:00.920
LAURA: He's at the back door.

03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:02.522
MARISHA: You guys are at the front.

03:14:02.522 --> 03:14:05.257
MATT: (loud popping) It goes off. On the inside is
a flash of light. You hear screams.

03:14:05.257 --> 03:14:06.937
LAURA: We're going in!

03:14:06.937 --> 03:14:11.925
MATT: You guys all burst inside. As you break
through the doors, wood splinters on the inside,

03:14:11.925 --> 03:14:16.651
light breaks in, and in the corner you can see
what looks to be four gnomish children.

03:14:16.651 --> 03:14:17.652
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:14:17.652 --> 03:14:22.518
MATT: Two of them teenage, two of them younger,
all scared out of their minds. The teenagers are

03:14:22.518 --> 03:14:27.522
trying to protect the two younger ones. You can
see a pile of gold around them on the ground.

03:14:27.522 --> 03:14:29.999
They're just like (panting).

03:14:29.999 --> 03:14:33.001
LAURA: You took the money! It was the little
girl!

03:14:33.001 --> 03:14:36.316
TRAVIS: Easy. Easy. Easy. We're not going to hurt
you.

03:14:36.316 --> 03:14:38.106
SAM: I will kill them all!

03:14:38.106 --> 03:14:43.184
TRAVIS: No, Nott! It's fine. You're not in any
danger.

03:14:43.184 --> 03:14:52.132
MATT: There is a gnome girl, the equivalent of
like 17 or so with very brown, curled hair, it's

03:14:52.132 --> 03:14:58.630
this uncontrolled mass, dirty on the cheek. A
younger boy with short red hair is the other

03:14:58.630 --> 03:15:03.542
protector of the two. Their clothes are pretty
dirty. Then there's the younger girl that you saw

03:15:03.542 --> 03:15:09.903
wandering through the tavern, who's on the ground
clutching a stuffed bear.

03:15:09.903 --> 03:15:13.377
LAURA: Didn't I say it right away? I said it right
away!

03:15:13.377 --> 03:15:19.014
MATT: You see a boy that's a little older than
her, about nine you would say, equivalent, with

03:15:19.014 --> 03:15:24.736
very long, brown hair that's around the shoulders,
and they all just look scared.

03:15:24.736 --> 03:15:31.607
TRAVIS: Nott Detective Agency always gets their
man! It's all right.

03:15:31.607 --> 03:15:36.330
LAURA: Hey. I know you, I saw you. Right? I gave
you some money?

03:15:36.330 --> 03:15:39.666
MARISHA: (coughs)

03:15:39.666 --> 03:15:40.981
MATT: She's not talking.

03:15:40.981 --> 03:15:44.630
LAURA: You. Stole. From. Our. Friends. Not. Cool.

03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:46.411
SAM: You went down a chimney.

03:15:46.411 --> 03:15:48.049
LIAM: It's not in character.

03:15:48.049 --> 03:15:49.926
MARISHA: (coughing) Sorry, wrong pipe. Keep
going.

03:15:49.926 --> 03:15:53.783
LAURA: I totally thought you were just doing the
"went down the chimney."

03:15:53.783 --> 03:15:58.511
MARISHA: (coughing) As I cough my way down the
chimney, "I'm coming!"

03:15:58.511 --> 03:16:06.045
MATT: You look up as she comes out the bottom in a
big old plume of soot. Just covered.

03:16:06.045 --> 03:16:08.879
MARISHA: I'm a little late and I look at the girl
and I say: It was you!

03:16:08.879 --> 03:16:10.917
TRAVIS: No, Beau, we're already winning.

03:16:10.917 --> 03:16:12.183
MARISHA: Sorry.

03:16:12.183 --> 03:16:24.176
MATT: The older girl, "Look, we don't mean
nothing, we're just trying to get by, okay? We

03:16:24.176 --> 03:16:35.094
"didn't realize how much you had on you, and to be
honest, it was both exciting and scary. Just don't

03:16:35.094 --> 03:16:36.736
"hurt anyone, please."

03:16:36.736 --> 03:16:38.668
LAURA: We're not going to hurt you. Just give it
all back.

03:16:38.668 --> 03:16:42.464
MATT: "Take it."

03:16:42.464 --> 03:16:45.626
LIAM: No parents at all?

03:16:45.626 --> 03:16:51.402
MATT: The girl looks sad for a moment, saying,
"Not for a little while."

03:16:51.402 --> 03:16:55.079
LIAM: How much have you hoarded up here? Just us,
or more?

03:16:55.079 --> 03:17:02.375
MATT: "We've scrambled coins here and there over
time, keep on by. Most everyone here only keeps a

03:17:02.375 --> 03:17:09.456
"few coins in their pockets. Hence our surprise
when this came about." The younger boy goes like,

03:17:09.456 --> 03:17:14.579
"Yeah, we don't expect this kind of a payload."

03:17:14.579 --> 03:17:17.876
TRAVIS: How old are you?

03:17:17.876 --> 03:17:28.338
MATT: The older girl goes, "I'm Gail. I'm 17."

03:17:28.338 --> 03:17:29.830
LAURA: Gail!

03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:40.359
MATT: The older boy goes, "I'm Austin." The little
boy with longer curly hair goes, "I'm Jude." The

03:17:40.359 --> 03:17:45.833
older girl points to the little girl and goes,
"That's Layla."

03:17:45.833 --> 03:17:51.664
TRAVIS: You said you haven't had your parents
around for a while now? What happened to them?

03:17:51.664 --> 03:18:00.046
MATT: They all look at each other, and the older
boy sits forward and goes, "Well, they got

03:18:00.046 --> 03:18:01.337
"arrested."

03:18:01.337 --> 03:18:02.519
TRAVIS: Doing what?

03:18:02.519 --> 03:18:08.210
MATT: "Got arrested for idol worship. False
worship."

03:18:08.210 --> 03:18:10.051
TRAVIS: Here? In Hupperdook?

03:18:10.051 --> 03:18:11.747
SAM: What god were they worshiping?

03:18:11.747 --> 03:18:13.008
LAURA: Was it the Traveler?

03:18:13.008 --> 03:18:15.607
MATT: "No. Changebringer."

03:18:15.607 --> 03:18:17.833
TRAVIS: The Changebringer?

03:18:17.833 --> 03:18:30.416
MATT: "Avandra. It's been in the family for a long
time. Every six months, the tithe collectors come

03:18:30.416 --> 03:18:41.130
"through, and they noticed they'd forgotten to put
away their idol worship. They locked them up.

03:18:41.130 --> 03:18:43.574
"They've been in the Gearhold ever since."

03:18:43.574 --> 03:18:45.064
TRAVIS: Tithe collectors?

03:18:45.064 --> 03:18:50.274
MATT: You know about those. Those of you who've
been in the Empire, part of living in the Empire

03:18:50.274 --> 03:18:55.069
is about every six months or so, there's a tax
man, a tithe collector that goes through, usually

03:18:55.069 --> 03:18:59.311
with a couple crownsguard. You recognize them by
black cloak with gold trim, usually dark clothing.

03:18:59.311 --> 03:19:08.140
They go building to building, business to
business, inspect ledgers, ask about their

03:19:08.140 --> 03:19:11.807
business, look at the means in which they're
living, and then make an estimation of what they

03:19:11.807 --> 03:19:18.587
owe. They then collect the money and move on their
way. But you know this from your studies, this is

03:19:18.587 --> 03:19:24.990
also used as a means of inspecting for any illegal
activity and anything that goes against the Crown.

03:19:24.990 --> 03:19:29.391
Often a lot of people get arrested for that.

03:19:29.391 --> 03:19:31.826
TRAVIS: You all brothers and sisters?

03:19:31.826 --> 03:19:33.305
MATT: "We are."

03:19:33.305 --> 03:19:34.807
TRAVIS: And your parents' names?

03:19:34.807 --> 03:19:38.472
MATT: "Gilda and Wallace Schuster. We're
Schusters."

03:19:38.472 --> 03:19:42.298
TALIESIN: How long have you been pickpocketing,
then?

03:19:42.298 --> 03:19:44.524
MATT: "Only about three months."

03:19:44.524 --> 03:19:47.018
TALIESIN: Mostly success at this point?

03:19:47.018 --> 03:19:50.912
MATT: "So far, so good. Most people don't seem to
pay much attention to the younger kids."

03:19:50.912 --> 03:19:56.474
TALIESIN: Well, this is good. This is a very
valuable lesson. If you ever come across a purse

03:19:56.474 --> 03:19:59.638
like this again, you just take a tiny bit of it,
and then leave the rest.

03:19:59.638 --> 03:20:02.597
MATT: "We just grab it and run, we didn't know how
much was here until we got back."

03:20:02.597 --> 03:20:06.808
TALIESIN: Well then, you just bring it back
immediately. Obviously you take five percent.

03:20:06.808 --> 03:20:10.416
MATT: "Right, no, I understand." Gail says, "We
understand, sir! We've learned our lesson!"

03:20:10.416 --> 03:20:20.088
MARISHA: Look, because you were so good at your
job, keep this. I hand him 20 gold. Look, I

03:20:20.088 --> 03:20:23.644
appreciate good work when I see it, all right? You
got our shit. That was pretty damn good.

03:20:23.644 --> 03:20:25.085
MATT: "Thank you."

03:20:25.085 --> 03:20:28.644
TRAVIS: Gail, you been taking care of your younger
siblings this whole time?

03:20:28.644 --> 03:20:35.004
MATT: "I've been trying, best we can. Our parents
worked as butchers, so we had some food to keep us

03:20:35.004 --> 03:20:39.591
"going for a while, but when stuff got thin and
begging wasn't working out, we, you know, did what

03:20:39.591 --> 03:20:44.569
"was necessary. And I'll do what it takes to make
sure my siblings stay healthy."

03:20:44.569 --> 03:20:46.240
TRAVIS: You been holed up here, or you on the
move?

03:20:46.240 --> 03:20:48.947
MATT: "We've held up here. This is where we grew
up."

03:20:48.947 --> 03:20:51.062
TRAVIS: How long before the tithe man comes back?

03:20:51.062 --> 03:20:57.665
MATT: "Anytime now, really. It's been six months.
But we ain't much of a business at this time."

03:20:57.665 --> 03:21:03.661
MARISHA: Is there anywhere they take kids? Kids
separated from their parents? Or do they just not care?

03:21:03.661 --> 03:21:08.271
MATT: "I hear stories, they round them up and
throw them to Rexxentrum in orphanages, and we

03:21:08.271 --> 03:21:10.098
"don't want to go there."

03:21:10.152 --> 03:21:12.875
MARISHA: So you're just avoiding them.

03:21:12.875 --> 03:21:22.544
TRAVIS: Gilda and Wallace. Let me ask you, if we
were to somehow get your parents out of the

03:21:22.544 --> 03:21:25.416
Gearhold prison, would you stay here?

03:21:25.416 --> 03:21:31.524
MATT: (nervous chuckle) "How would you intend on
getting my parents out of the prison?"

03:21:31.524 --> 03:21:33.391
TRAVIS: I'm the one asking questions here.

03:21:33.391 --> 03:21:41.063
MATT: "I mean, legally? We'd probably stay here
and reopen the shop."

03:21:41.063 --> 03:21:49.256
TRAVIS: You don't seem to be taking my meaning. If
we were to reunite you with your folks, would you

03:21:49.256 --> 03:21:51.025
get out of town right quick?

03:21:51.025 --> 03:21:59.694
MATT: "If it were by means where people would come
looking for us, we would definitely be heading

03:21:59.694 --> 03:22:01.371
"somewhere other than here."

03:22:01.371 --> 03:22:04.955
TRAVIS: Give us a moment, will you?

03:22:04.955 --> 03:22:06.266
MATT: "All right."

03:22:06.266 --> 03:22:09.534
TALIESIN: How soft are you getting?

03:22:09.534 --> 03:22:16.247
SAM: It's very clear. We have Kiri already. We
take these four children with us, and we keep going.

03:22:16.247 --> 03:22:19.200
MARISHA: And we start a children's band.

03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:21.384
TRAVIS: The Partridge Family.

03:22:21.384 --> 03:22:22.774
MARISHA: Yes, exactly!

03:22:22.774 --> 03:22:26.997
LAURA: We can teach them the dances that we have
been learning, and working on!

03:22:26.997 --> 03:22:32.941
TALIESIN: If I've learned anything, you don't work
with animals or children, and we're rapidly

03:22:32.941 --> 03:22:34.379
getting both!

03:22:34.379 --> 03:22:37.411
MATT: Hey man, attach them all by chains to your
armor, and you guys are the new Dread Emperor!

03:22:37.411 --> 03:22:39.891
LIAM: Throwback!

03:22:39.891 --> 03:22:49.799
TRAVIS: Keyleth! No, but seriously. Listen,
they've obviously done a fair job of

03:22:49.799 --> 03:22:53.739
taking care of themselves. We could toss them some
coin and wish them well.

03:22:53.739 --> 03:22:56.092
TALIESIN: I see no problem with that.

03:22:56.092 --> 03:23:05.005
TRAVIS: Or, if we're serious about returning Cleff
with his (tongue click), might as well see if we

03:23:05.005 --> 03:23:07.088
can get a little extra friend or two out.

03:23:07.088 --> 03:23:09.302
TALIESIN: Let's make no promises, but again--

03:23:09.302 --> 03:23:14.983
TRAVIS: No promises, but man, if we have an
opportunity to reunite these kids with their

03:23:14.983 --> 03:23:18.987
parents, that's a pretty special deed, don't you
think?

03:23:18.987 --> 03:23:20.344
TALIESIN: You are so soft!

03:23:20.344 --> 03:23:22.634
LAURA: Can I ask a shitty question?

03:23:22.634 --> 03:23:23.956
TALIESIN: Oh, please!

03:23:23.956 --> 03:23:33.588
LAURA: If we take the time right now to break
their parents out and get that automaton, are we

03:23:33.588 --> 03:23:36.637
going to lose time on the thing for The Gentleman?

03:23:36.637 --> 03:23:38.104
LIAM: Yes, we are.

03:23:38.104 --> 03:23:39.383
TRAVIS: Man, I entirely forgot.

03:23:39.383 --> 03:23:41.633
SAM: But we still have weeks left, don't we?

03:23:41.633 --> 03:23:46.403
MARISHA: But it's still another three or four
days.

03:23:46.403 --> 03:23:50.081
SAM: You have a means of contacting The Gentleman.
You could ask for a three-day extension.

03:23:50.081 --> 03:23:54.371
TALIESIN: I tend to find these sorts of jobs,
asking for a three-day extension does not go well.

03:23:54.371 --> 03:23:59.617
You're given the time, you do the job, you finish
it, you don't ask questions, you don't ask for special--

03:23:59.617 --> 03:24:02.823
LIAM: Haven't you been working for the circus for
two years?

03:24:02.823 --> 03:24:08.673
TALIESIN: That's what I'm talking about. When
you're in a circus, sometimes you get paid to do

03:24:08.673 --> 03:24:13.814
gigs. Things have happened. I've run a couple
things in my time.

03:24:13.814 --> 03:24:16.639
LAURA: Insight check.

03:24:16.639 --> 03:24:17.963
MATT: Insight check?

03:24:17.963 --> 03:24:20.100
TRAVIS: I think it's, "Do I believe him?" right?

03:24:20.100 --> 03:24:21.496
MATT: Yes. Do I believe him?

03:24:21.496 --> 03:24:23.124
MARISHA: But insight check has become such a
thing!

03:24:23.124 --> 03:24:24.107
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

03:24:24.107 --> 03:24:25.269
MATT: Frustratingly so, yes!

03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:27.242
TRAVIS and MARISHA: But the DM hates it!

03:24:27.242 --> 03:24:29.018
MATT: I find it amusing.

03:24:29.018 --> 03:24:31.192
LAURA: Sorry. Do I think he's lying?

03:24:31.192 --> 03:24:40.630
TALIESIN: We're a circus! Of course we've robbed
people! My god, we have robbed, swindled, we've

03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:45.548
been robbed, we've gone back and found the people
who've robbed them, sometimes we don't! Oh my god, yes.

03:24:45.548 --> 03:24:48.727
LIAM: Does that mean that your cards are bullshit?

03:24:48.727 --> 03:24:51.890
MARISHA: Of course they're bullshit, they're
fucking cards.

03:24:51.890 --> 03:24:54.247
LAURA: No they're not, they're super true!

03:24:54.247 --> 03:24:55.583
LIAM: I am asking Mollymauk.

03:24:55.583 --> 03:24:59.098
TALIESIN: You're asking if my cards are bullshit?
My cards are not bullshit.

03:24:59.098 --> 03:25:04.551
LIAM: I want to say "insight check" so bad, but I
won't say it!

03:25:04.551 --> 03:25:06.288
TALIESIN: I know you do! But you won't say it.

03:25:06.288 --> 03:25:15.258
SAM: Caleb, you have a photographic memory, as you
remind us every session. How long do we have until

03:25:15.258 --> 03:25:20.715
our time is up with The Gentleman?

03:25:20.715 --> 03:25:24.588
LIAM: DM will fill that information in.

03:25:24.588 --> 03:25:35.404
MATT: Let's see, we had about three days traveling
there. Since you left, you have about two and a

03:25:35.404 --> 03:25:36.982
half weeks, I'll say, estimated at the moment.

03:25:36.982 --> 03:25:43.700
SAM: How long would it take, do we think, to get up
north there, if we went straight? A week?

03:25:43.765 --> 03:25:45.365
MARISHA: From Hupperdook?

03:25:45.365 --> 03:25:51.109
MATT: I would say, off the top of my head, a
little under a week.

03:25:51.109 --> 03:25:56.547
SAM: So we've got a couple weeks! We have a day
or two to spend on some prison breaking.

03:25:56.601 --> 03:25:59.052
TALIESIN: We've got a day or two to spend on this,
but not a week.

03:25:59.052 --> 03:26:07.896
MARISHA: Hang on. This thing has been a problem
for years, the clockwork warden? Why don't we just

03:26:07.896 --> 03:26:10.647
go, finish our stuff, we have to cross back
through here, anyway.

03:26:10.647 --> 03:26:11.798
LAURA: And come back?

03:26:11.798 --> 03:26:13.292
MARISHA: And come back and finish the job.

03:26:13.292 --> 03:26:14.659
LIAM: We already have a job.

03:26:14.659 --> 03:26:20.252
SAM: Beauregard, don't you think they should be
reunited with their father who loves them very

03:26:20.252 --> 03:26:22.520
much, and wants to be with them?

03:26:22.520 --> 03:26:29.880
MARISHA: Of course I do. They've been scrappy for
long enough. They can be scrappy for another week

03:26:29.880 --> 03:26:30.860
or two.

03:26:30.860 --> 03:26:32.878
LAURA: They don't even have to be that scrappy
now.

03:26:32.878 --> 03:26:35.764
TRAVIS: They said the tithe man could return any
day.

03:26:35.764 --> 03:26:37.481
SAM: And take them to an orphanage.

03:26:37.481 --> 03:26:38.906
TRAVIS: What if we come back and they're gone?

03:26:38.906 --> 03:26:44.790
SAM: It would be horrible if they were taken away
from their home and given to some people who would

03:26:44.790 --> 03:26:51.993
do horrible things to them, or mistreat them for
their whole childhoods, leaving them as cold,

03:26:51.993 --> 03:26:54.552
heartless, resting bitches.

03:26:54.552 --> 03:26:59.140
TALIESIN: Didn't you almost open fire on these
children not more than 30 seconds ago?

03:26:59.140 --> 03:27:01.541
SAM: That was an intimidation tactic. I would
never hurt a child!

03:27:01.541 --> 03:27:02.758
TALIESIN: Of course you would!

03:27:02.758 --> 03:27:04.562
SAM: No, I wouldn't! I love children.

03:27:04.562 --> 03:27:05.746
TRAVIS: You'd eat a child.

03:27:05.746 --> 03:27:07.340
SAM: That was an accident!

03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:11.142
TRAVIS: I knew I saw you drooling!

03:27:11.142 --> 03:27:13.831
TALIESIN: This is why I don't miss the circus.

03:27:13.831 --> 03:27:18.243
LAURA: Okay. What are we doing?

03:27:18.243 --> 03:27:25.541
LIAM: It depends on how altruistic this group is.
We already have a job. I mean, I will defer to the

03:27:25.541 --> 03:27:28.291
group, but we have a job and we are on a time
table.

03:27:28.291 --> 03:27:31.460
TRAVIS: I would really like the opportunity to
leave this place better than we found it,

03:27:31.460 --> 03:27:33.188
especially for these kids.

03:27:33.188 --> 03:27:38.424
TALIESIN: I'm not saying no, I'm just saying
remember that we are hired hands.

03:27:38.424 --> 03:27:42.543
TRAVIS: I understand. If it goes sideways, it goes
sideways, and we run. But if we can keep them out

03:27:42.543 --> 03:27:48.251
of an orphanage, I would be most grateful to all
of you.

03:27:48.251 --> 03:27:49.804
TALIESIN: I've done dumber shit.

03:27:49.804 --> 03:27:51.611
LAURA: All right.

03:27:51.611 --> 03:27:55.123
MARISHA: I mean, Nott's over here trying to pull
my heart strings, but it seems like you should be

03:27:55.123 --> 03:27:58.012
the target. You have a thing with kids and
orphanages?

03:27:58.012 --> 03:28:01.219
SAM: Were you an orphan?

03:28:01.219 --> 03:28:04.029
MARISHA: Separated from dad?

03:28:04.029 --> 03:28:05.633
TALIESIN: Have you ever eaten an orphan?

03:28:05.633 --> 03:28:07.573
LIAM: Ja, so much for sticking to the plan.

03:28:07.573 --> 03:28:08.893
SAM: Were you an orphan?

03:28:08.893 --> 03:28:14.853
TRAVIS: Yes. I was. They're terrible fucking
places.

03:28:14.853 --> 03:28:19.040
SAM: Sorry.

03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:21.245
TALIESIN: Say no more. I'm in.

03:28:21.245 --> 03:28:28.795
MARISHA: You know, I'm interested if there's a
master lever to this prison. Just prison break,

03:28:28.795 --> 03:28:30.501
see what happens.

03:28:30.501 --> 03:28:33.981
TALIESIN: That sounds like a terrible idea.

03:28:33.981 --> 03:28:39.002
LAURA: Maybe we can negotiate our way into the
prison and say we'll take care of the automaton,

03:28:39.002 --> 03:28:43.705
and while we're in there, we can sneak around and
set the parents free.

03:28:43.705 --> 03:28:49.994
MARISHA: All right, if we do this, I think we need
to give ourselves a hard time limit that we all

03:28:49.994 --> 03:28:55.187
stick to, because the last thing that I want is
for the fucking Gentlemen with his vials of our

03:28:55.187 --> 03:28:57.511
DNA coming after our asses.

03:28:57.511 --> 03:28:58.720
TRAVIS: Agreed.

03:28:58.720 --> 03:29:01.727
LAURA: As long as we give him some notice, I think
it will be okay.

03:29:01.727 --> 03:29:04.999
MARISHA: I have a feeling The Gentleman isn't a
guy that negotiates on time periods.

03:29:04.999 --> 03:29:10.550
TRAVIS: The effort is all I ask for. We're a
clever group. Surely we can survey, come up with a

03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:15.854
plan, try something. If we fail, we fail, and
we'll move on with our objective. I can't leave

03:29:15.854 --> 03:29:17.398
here without trying.

03:29:17.398 --> 03:29:23.627
LIAM: I would like it to be predicated on us
coming up with at least a respectable plan, not

03:29:23.627 --> 03:29:26.522
willy-nilly, fly in with our balls out.

03:29:26.522 --> 03:29:28.837
TALIESIN: I'm also in it for a crossbow.

03:29:28.837 --> 03:29:33.480
MARISHA: I guess it doesn't hurt to ask The
Gentleman, if worst comes to worst.

03:29:33.480 --> 03:29:38.902
TALIESIN: Just remember, you either get the
nickname "The Gentleman" because you are one, or

03:29:38.902 --> 03:29:40.199
because you're really not.

03:29:40.199 --> 03:29:42.801
LAURA: Ooh, good point.

03:29:42.801 --> 03:29:46.905
TRAVIS: How about we bring the kids back in, we
give them a little coin so they stay out of

03:29:46.905 --> 03:29:48.741
trouble, for the next--

03:29:48.741 --> 03:29:50.445
MARISHA: They have 30 gold on them.

03:29:50.445 --> 03:29:52.123
LAURA: They got a lot of gold on them.

03:29:52.123 --> 03:29:53.505
LIAM: That's a lot of money.

03:29:53.505 --> 03:29:57.127
TRAVIS: We tell them to stay put, unless they're
getting food.

03:29:57.127 --> 03:30:00.993
TALIESIN: I'm gonna give them-- nope, never mind.
I'm not going to give them that, because that

03:30:00.993 --> 03:30:02.361
would be a terrible idea.

03:30:02.361 --> 03:30:06.192
MARISHA: Caleb, how long does your string theory
work?

03:30:06.192 --> 03:30:07.297
LIAM: String theory?

03:30:07.297 --> 03:30:10.391
SAM: Eight hours, right?

03:30:10.391 --> 03:30:11.815
LIAM: Eight hours, yeah.

03:30:11.815 --> 03:30:13.045
MARISHA: What time is it?

03:30:13.045 --> 03:30:17.034
MATT: At this point, it's probably pushing one or
two in the afternoon.

03:30:17.034 --> 03:30:19.007
LIAM: Do we have any food we can leave for them,
so they don't have to--?

03:30:19.007 --> 03:30:22.046
SAM: I have some human jerky left over.

03:30:22.046 --> 03:30:25.845
LAURA: I did pocket some of the breakfast from
this morning.

03:30:25.845 --> 03:30:27.911
MATT: You did, yeah. Do you give that to them?

03:30:27.911 --> 03:30:29.052
LAURA: Yeah.

03:30:29.052 --> 03:30:34.406
MATT: The kids hungrily accept, and devour, evenly
dividing amongst them. They feed the younger kids

03:30:34.406 --> 03:30:38.401
first and then whatever is left over, the older
ones take. They say, "Thank you, I really

03:30:38.401 --> 03:30:39.626
"appreciate that."

03:30:39.626 --> 03:30:44.896
TALIESIN: I've got a good idea. I'm going to give
the older one one of my rings. I've got these

03:30:44.896 --> 03:30:51.134
strange little rings that I left over. Keep that
on you, sell it if you have to, but see if you can

03:30:51.134 --> 03:31:01.453
hold off for a while. If things go wrong, get
within 1,000 feet of the Blushing Tavern, hide and

03:31:01.453 --> 03:31:02.992
wait, and we'll find you.

03:31:02.992 --> 03:31:04.847
MATT: "All right."

03:31:04.847 --> 03:31:06.232
TALIESIN: Hide.

03:31:06.232 --> 03:31:12.101
MATT: "We'll keep that in mind, thank you. Thank
you kindly." Is it a ring finger, a finger ring?

03:31:12.101 --> 03:31:13.384
TALIESIN: It's a finger ring.

03:31:13.384 --> 03:31:16.145
LAURA and MARISHA: It's a fingering?

03:31:16.145 --> 03:31:18.424
TALIESIN: It was one of the rings that we found in
the cave.

03:31:18.424 --> 03:31:23.974
MATT: He puts it over his thumb. For his body and
size, it goes over his thumb. It's still a little

03:31:23.974 --> 03:31:30.582
loose, but it'll stay. "Thank you. I don't know
how we'll repay you, but--"

03:31:30.582 --> 03:31:38.725
LAURA: Question: what are we going to do with Kiri
right now, if we're going down into the jail?

03:31:38.725 --> 03:31:41.348
LIAM: I think she has a sleepover--

03:31:41.348 --> 03:31:43.640
TRAVIS: With the girl we found, right?

03:31:43.640 --> 03:31:46.046
MARISHA: And Yasha?

03:31:46.046 --> 03:31:50.363
LAURA: Or with these fabulous kids right now? No,
Yasha needs to come with us. We need her help.

03:31:50.363 --> 03:31:51.818
MARISHA: Oh, that's true.

03:31:51.818 --> 03:31:56.280
MATT: Yeah, Yasha's like, "No, if we're going into
a prison to kill something, I want to be there."

03:31:56.280 --> 03:31:58.663
MARISHA: That's true. Sorry. Forgot what time it
was!

03:31:58.663 --> 03:32:06.555
SAM: Well, we know how much the prostitutes cost
to watch Kiri.

03:32:06.555 --> 03:32:07.954
TALIESIN: She said it.

03:32:07.954 --> 03:32:10.643
TRAVIS: Or we could drop Kiri off with the little
girl that--

03:32:10.643 --> 03:32:13.039
LAURA: Or Kiri can stay here with these wonderful
children.

03:32:13.039 --> 03:32:16.726
LIAM: They are very capable children.

03:32:16.726 --> 03:32:18.998
MATT: Kiri goes, (like Nott) "That sounds
adorable!"

03:32:18.998 --> 03:32:20.663
LAURA: (gasps) Do you want to stay with them?!

03:32:20.663 --> 03:32:22.450
MATT: (like Jester) "Okay!"

03:32:22.450 --> 03:32:23.910
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

03:32:23.910 --> 03:32:25.993
SAM: The children do owe us a little bit.

03:32:25.993 --> 03:32:28.993
LAURA: Children, oh, Schusters.

03:32:28.993 --> 03:32:33.009
SAM: Oh Schusters!

03:32:33.009 --> 03:32:39.728
LAURA: Do you guys want to watch our little friend
here as well?

03:32:39.728 --> 03:32:45.708
MATT: (chirping) The little girl walks up and
touches the feathers, and you see the feathers of

03:32:45.708 --> 03:32:50.399
Kiri's head (rustling) and her eyes close for a
second as she's scratching the side of her head.

03:32:50.399 --> 03:32:55.703
LAURA: She's like you, though, so she's not like a
pet or anything. She's a real little girl, okay?

03:32:55.703 --> 03:33:00.629
MARISHA: Hey Kiri, show them your music box.

03:33:00.629 --> 03:33:10.233
MATT: (cranking) (music box chiming) It starts
playing, and the little girl leans in and they all

03:33:10.233 --> 03:33:18.176
close in quickly. For a moment, you can see this
little unit of kids meeting a new friend, and a

03:33:18.176 --> 03:33:22.338
friend meeting new kids. You're like, okay, they
might be okay for a little bit.

03:33:22.338 --> 03:33:26.647
TRAVIS: You take care of each other. You're a
little temporary family for now.

03:33:26.647 --> 03:33:29.441
MARISHA: He's going to make some protection.

03:33:29.441 --> 03:33:35.191
LIAM: Kinder, this is a thread I am going to put
around the chamber that you are living in, and I

03:33:35.191 --> 03:33:41.462
will know if our little feathered friend or you
all leave. You're perfectly welcome to. I'm just

03:33:41.462 --> 03:33:44.936
letting you know that I will know, ja? Okay.

03:33:44.936 --> 03:33:49.270
MATT: They all nod to you. Kiri looks to Fjord and
(dagger unsheathing).

03:33:49.270 --> 03:34:01.528
LAURA: (whispers) Don't stab any of the other
kids, okay?

03:34:01.528 --> 03:34:03.379
MATT: (whispers) (like Jester) "Okay."

03:34:03.379 --> 03:34:05.739
TRAVIS: Remember, stay quiet.

03:34:05.739 --> 03:34:06.994
MATT: (like Fjord) "Stay quiet."

03:34:06.994 --> 03:34:12.994
TALIESIN: Oh! So weird!

03:34:12.994 --> 03:34:21.442
MATT: Leaving the kids there, you all quietly exit
the building, reaffirming the doors you had kicked in.

03:34:21.442 --> 03:34:27.597
SAM: Oh yeah! Going to lean those up against the
door jamb.

03:34:27.597 --> 03:34:29.485
LAURA: Oh! I cast Mending on the doors!

03:34:29.485 --> 03:34:34.801
MATT: There you go! You manage to get the doors
back into a sizeable place and begin to discuss how

03:34:34.801 --> 03:34:39.509
you're going to tackle this next endeavor. And
that's where we'll finish this week's episode.

03:34:39.509 --> 03:34:40.982
We'll pick up next week.

03:34:40.982 --> 03:34:42.150
MARISHA: Such a good game!

03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:43.389
MATT: Well done, guys!

03:34:43.389 --> 03:34:44.680
MARISHA: That was funsies.

03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:46.193
MATT: We'll see if--

03:34:46.193 --> 03:34:47.810
LAURA: Hey, we got the money back!

03:34:47.810 --> 03:34:48.856
MARISHA: We got the money back!

03:34:48.856 --> 03:34:53.148
MATT: See if you can earn your Tinkertop
Boltblaster 1000.

03:34:53.170 --> 03:34:54.467
MARISHA: Oh my god!

03:34:54.467 --> 03:34:57.460
TRAVIS: Could have just gone back and bought it,
but no, we want to go the expert level!

03:34:57.460 --> 03:35:06.664
MARISHA: Yo, you can buy it or you can collect all
48 pinecones and then you just unlock it. It's

03:35:06.664 --> 03:35:07.763
like that.

03:35:07.763 --> 03:35:09.320
MATT: Hey man! Good game, guys! Awesome!

03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:14.152
LAURA: We should definitely rest before the next
part because I just used up all my 2nd-level spells.

03:35:14.152 --> 03:35:18.734
SAM: We'll do recon for the afternoon and then
we'll attack tomorrow morning.

03:35:18.734 --> 03:35:19.826
LAURA: Okay.

03:35:19.826 --> 03:35:20.840
MARISHA: Yeah, plan.

03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:24.382
SAM: Unless this guy comes in the next week!

03:35:24.382 --> 03:35:25.771
LAURA: Hey!

03:35:25.771 --> 03:35:27.619
SAM: If that happens!

03:35:27.619 --> 03:35:30.092
MATT: Oh my goodness.

03:35:30.092 --> 03:35:34.247
MARISHA: (bass guitar melody)

03:35:34.247 --> 03:35:46.268
MATT: My God! And on that note! Have a wonderful
week, guys. We'll see you next Thursday for the

03:35:46.268 --> 03:35:53.270
next stage of this crazy adventure. Remember, we
love you, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

03:35:53.270 --> 03:46:14.244

00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.448
MATT: Hello and welcome, everybody, to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.448 --> 00:00:04.501
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.664
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:10.089
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:11.912
MATT: Oh, we're in rare form already, this is bad.

6
00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:13.503
LIAM: Is this really a permanent installment?

7
00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:14.336
It's here for good?

8
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:15.472
SAM and LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

9
00:00:15.472 --> 00:00:16.457
MATT: Oh boy.

10
00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:19.080
Sadly, no Taliesin tonight. He's very sick,

11
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.570
so he's home probably watching, hopefully watching this,

12
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.636
so you can keep with how we ruin your character

13
00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:25.008
while you're gone.
LAURA: No!

14
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.157
MATT: So get better, buddy,

15
00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:29.137
and we'll see you when we come back.

16
00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:29.970
TRAVIS: Got too close to a time-traveling

17
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.061
version of himself.

18
00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:32.575
MATT: Yeah, he was like, "I can make it!"

19
00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:34.435
And we're like, "No, do not be patient zero."

20
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:35.835
MARISHA: Timeline fatigue, it's a real issue.

21
00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.643
LIAM: Super rude of him to not have his character die

22
00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:40.776
last week since he wasn't going to be here today.

23
00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:42.011
MARISHA: Yeah.

24
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:43.471
MATT: That's horrifying.

25
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:44.554
So yeah.

26
00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:46.498
Feel better, Taliesin.

27
00:00:47.893 --> 00:00:49.424
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

28
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:50.748
we have some quick announcements to get through.

29
00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:53.591
First and foremost, we have our wonderful sponsor

30
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:56.375
of the campaign, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

31
00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:57.355
Sam?

32
00:00:57.355 --> 00:00:59.374
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, everybody.
MATT: Oh jeez.

33
00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:02.386
SAM: Speaking of campaigns, everyone is on

34
00:01:02.386 --> 00:01:05.458
the edge of their seats to see what will unfold

35
00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.976
in the campaign for president of D&amp;D Beyond.

36
00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:09.541
If you're just joining the show,

37
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:11.644
you might not have noticed, but I, Sam Riegel,

38
00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:13.877
am running a ferocious campaign

39
00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:17.503
to become the president of D&amp;D Beyond, the company.

40
00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:19.585
Not sure yet if they know this,

41
00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.511
but I'm going to win, and will command their company.

42
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:27.082
Running against me has been Liam O'Brien, doing a great job.

43
00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:28.334
LIAM: You see the polls lately?

44
00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:30.384
SAM: The polls, not only have I seen the polls,

45
00:01:30.384 --> 00:01:32.220
we were just up in Seattle and a lot of people

46
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.217
who came by our tables for like an autograph or whatever

47
00:01:36.217 --> 00:01:38.646
said they were voting for you, friend,

48
00:01:38.646 --> 00:01:42.071
which scared the shit out of me.

49
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:42.983
TRAVIS: Don't believe the polls.

50
00:01:42.983 --> 00:01:45.558
LIAM: D&amp;D players want a firm hand.

51
00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:49.057
SAM: I think, ultimately, your strong-arm,

52
00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:51.566
authoritarian technique will fail.

53
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:54.781
But just in case, I've prepared an ad--

54
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.332
which I hope will win me back support--

55
00:01:57.332 --> 00:02:01.167
by showing the people what I think they really like

56
00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:04.346
and they really want most out of a candidate:

57
00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:06.950
celebrity endorsements.

58
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.548
So I've lined up some pretty hot celebrity endorsements,

59
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:12.868
and I hope they will turn the tide of this election.

60
00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:14.835
Roll that video, guys.

61
00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:17.668
[patriotic music]

62
00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.069
BEN: Sam is the man for me.

63
00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:30.347
Truth, justice, and the Sam-merican way. That's terrible.

64
00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.034
AIMEE: What's up?

65
00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:37.617
BOBBY: Sam Riegel makes shit happen.

66
00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:40.045
AIMEE: Truth, justice.

67
00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:43.295
Truth, justice and the Sam-merican way.

68
00:02:45.314 --> 00:02:48.065
And the Sam-merican way.

69
00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:51.009
DAVE: Yay to my bestest best friend, Sam.

70
00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:54.567
Yay Sam.

71
00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:57.688
And boo Liam!

72
00:02:57.688 --> 00:02:58.663
We done?

73
00:02:58.663 --> 00:03:00.392
GREY: Sam Riegel is running for president,

74
00:03:00.392 --> 00:03:04.809
and he asked me to make an endorsement video for him.

75
00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:08.482
TIM: Hi, this is Timothy Simons, and on behalf of Sam

76
00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:13.482
I just wanted to say that-- he really wants me to say that?

77
00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:18.693
GREY: So I said I would, and so I am,

78
00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:23.269
and this is my endorsement video, that I said I would make.

79
00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.172
I have to see Sam a lot, so,

80
00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:29.779
I told him I would make this, so.

81
00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:30.696
This is it.

82
00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:35.586
BOBBY: Sam Riegel for president.

83
00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.458
YVETTE: Sam, Sam, he's our man, if he can't do it

84
00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:42.901
no one can, vote Sam.

85
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:43.932
Who's Sam?

86
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:47.164
BEN: Sam is the man for me.

87
00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:48.441
AIMEE: Vote for Sam.

88
00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:50.891
Can you give me my phone, please?

89
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:52.266
I just have to make a quick call,

90
00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.152
I have to call my agent because I didn't get a break.

91
00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:57.170
No, I didn't get the SAG meal.

92
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.003
(censor beep)

93
00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:02.961
BEN: Truth, justice, and the Sam-merican way.

94
00:04:03.965 --> 00:04:06.215
The terrible fucking things he wants me to say.

95
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.998
Sam Riegel makes shit happen.

96
00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.356
Sam Riegel makes shit happen.

97
00:04:18.142 --> 00:04:19.884
TONY: Is it Rie-gel?

98
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.842
Okay.

99
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.099
The love and compassion that this person has for the world

100
00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.006
is insurmountable.

101
00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:33.506
Samantha Riegel.

102
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.486
BOBBY: Vote for Sam Rogel for president.

103
00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:43.259
Is that his name?

104
00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:45.347
Am I done?

105
00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:48.174
SAM: I'm Sam Riegel, and I approved this message,

106
00:04:48.174 --> 00:04:52.598
because celebrities are the best among us. (kiss)

107
00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:55.036
[patriotic music]

108
00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:56.835
SAM: I rest my case.

109
00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:58.886
I mean--
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

110
00:04:58.886 --> 00:05:00.017
MARISHA: Holy shit.

111
00:05:00.017 --> 00:05:03.465
SAM: Celebrities typically know better than you and I do.

112
00:05:03.465 --> 00:05:07.452
They exist on a higher level of thinking and existence,

113
00:05:07.452 --> 00:05:12.420
and when a celebrity says that you're good, you're good.

114
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.570
TRAVIS: How much shit do you have on them?

115
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.934
Do you have a recording of their farts

116
00:05:15.934 --> 00:05:16.817
in the booth or something?

117
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:19.126
SAM: I absolutely, every time they've said a naughty word,

118
00:05:19.126 --> 00:05:22.126
I've recorded it and kept it banked.

119
00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:26.343
Anyway, thanks to D&amp;D Beyond for sponsoring the show,

120
00:05:26.343 --> 00:05:28.974
and I hope I can run your company someday.

121
00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:30.134
Back to you, Matt.

122
00:05:30.134 --> 00:05:33.313
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you everyone who's now

123
00:05:33.313 --> 00:05:37.068
debt-free of what they owed Sam Riegel over all these years.

124
00:05:37.068 --> 00:05:39.206
TRAVIS: Getting out of hand.

125
00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:40.039
MATT: Holy shit.

126
00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.508
All right, yes, and thank you D&amp;D Beyond,

127
00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:46.107
for making this happen every week.

128
00:05:46.107 --> 00:05:47.872
SAM: Mm-hmm.

129
00:05:47.872 --> 00:05:50.502
MATT: A big thank you to everyone who came out and saw us

130
00:05:50.502 --> 00:05:52.706
this past weekend at Emerald City Comic Con.

131
00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:56.455
We had an amazing time, it was a great panel,

132
00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:58.302
the Critters come out in full force,

133
00:05:58.302 --> 00:06:00.974
every convention we just take over

134
00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:03.743
and it's amazing. We had the opportunity

135
00:06:03.743 --> 00:06:06.186
to meet a whole bunch of you guys,

136
00:06:06.186 --> 00:06:09.384
had some incredible times, got some incredible gifts

137
00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:11.904
from a number of fantastic folks out there,

138
00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.998
shared some great words, some tears, some hugs.

139
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:16.522
So thank you all for making the time out there

140
00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:19.707
to come see us, and we have Denver Comic Con coming up soon,

141
00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:21.551
and other events throughout the year

142
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:23.701
that we get to announce as we go.

143
00:06:23.701 --> 00:06:25.803
Super excited about that.

144
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.371
Travis, you had an announcement.

145
00:06:27.371 --> 00:06:29.751
TRAVIS: Yes, oh, all you crazy beautiful people,

146
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:32.412
our Vox Machina, Legend of Vox Machina

147
00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.113
Kickstarter animated series campaign

148
00:06:34.113 --> 00:06:37.709
is still running strong!

149
00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:40.126
That's my best Sam Riegel impression.

150
00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:41.900
MATT: That's pretty good.

151
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.609
TRAVIS: We have currently raised over $7.7 million

152
00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:50.312
to make this animated special series, Briarwood amazingness.

153
00:06:50.312 --> 00:06:55.312
Our next and final, really, stretch goal is $8.8 million,

154
00:06:55.377 --> 00:06:58.498
and if we hit that, we will be able to complete the series

155
00:06:58.498 --> 00:07:02.471
and make ten episodes of The Legend of Vox Machina.

156
00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:06.387
SAM: Holy shit. Guys, we might actually get there.

157
00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:07.743
TRAVIS: I know!

158
00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:10.050
SAM: This is like, it's possible, we could make

159
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.826
a whole season of a TV show.

160
00:07:11.826 --> 00:07:13.572
TRAVIS: Don't even know.

161
00:07:13.572 --> 00:07:18.572
MATT: Just us and the community. No big companies, nothing.

162
00:07:18.787 --> 00:07:22.311
TRAVIS: It's amazing, everybody knows.

163
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:26.635
Also, if we hit 8.8, finally, finally,

164
00:07:26.635 --> 00:07:31.579
our very own Ashley Johnson will DM her very first game.

165
00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:34.383
We will put her behind that screen, we will effectively

166
00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:37.318
kidnap her from NBC Blindspot, and it will be amazing.

167
00:07:37.318 --> 00:07:41.727
Don't quote me on that. Thank you all.

168
00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.977
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Travis.

169
00:07:43.977 --> 00:07:45.874
Laura, I think you had a quick merch announcement to make?

170
00:07:45.874 --> 00:07:47.175
LAURA: Oh, me?

171
00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.006
MATT: Yes, you.

172
00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:52.970
LAURA: Oh, this Cobalt journal?

173
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.988
Y'all, this has been a long time coming,

174
00:07:54.988 --> 00:07:56.490
we've been working on this for a while.

175
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.872
Taliesin designed this gorgeous--

176
00:07:58.872 --> 00:07:59.705
SAM: No way.

177
00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:01.479
LAURA: Yeah. He created all of the fricking code.

178
00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:03.112
This is what we used in our--

179
00:08:03.112 --> 00:08:04.666
MATT: It's an actual, functional, written language

180
00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:06.111
of the Cobalt Soul cipher.

181
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.330
LAURA: I mean, shoutout--

182
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.847
LIAM: Taliesin has been talking about that design

183
00:08:08.847 --> 00:08:10.077
for about two years.

184
00:08:10.077 --> 00:08:11.675
LAURA: Yeah, and every time I was like, "Is it done?"

185
00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:13.172
He's like, "It's almost there."

186
00:08:13.172 --> 00:08:14.105
This is worth it.

187
00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:15.992
SAM: Did any of us actually look at it

188
00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:17.667
to see what it actually means?

189
00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:19.867
MATT: I did, thankfully. Yeah.

190
00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:21.286
It's actually really cool.

191
00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:23.775
It has a bunch of hidden symbolism and stuff in it.

192
00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:26.168
MARISHA: I wish he was here to explain it all.

193
00:08:26.168 --> 00:08:27.322
LAURA: I know, I know.

194
00:08:27.322 --> 00:08:30.262
I got a lot of tweets from you guys

195
00:08:30.262 --> 00:08:32.800
with our journals that we've released in the past,

196
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.293
and a lot of you were like, "Can we have gridded paper?

197
00:08:35.293 --> 00:08:36.857
Because I like to make notes of my maps."

198
00:08:36.857 --> 00:08:40.841
So I made the back 30% of it gridded paper

199
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.719
for people who like to check things out.

200
00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:44.552
MATT: OG.

201
00:08:44.552 --> 00:08:46.578
LAURA: So yeah, pretty freakin' cool.

202
00:08:46.578 --> 00:08:50.325
It's in the shop right now, and it's also in the UK store

203
00:08:50.325 --> 00:08:51.690
right now.

204
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.674
TRAVIS: Chicka chicka.

205
00:08:52.674 --> 00:08:54.132
MATT: Mmm bomp bomp.

206
00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:57.415
We can't get clearance on that one. Thank you, Laura.

207
00:08:57.415 --> 00:08:59.417
Super excited, they've been working on that for a while,

208
00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:00.934
so super excited to see that.

209
00:09:00.934 --> 00:09:02.428
LAURA: There's a thing, you can close it,

210
00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:05.391
you can place mark stuff. It's pretty great.

211
00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:08.600
(laughter)

212
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.678
MATT: All true, all true.

213
00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:13.217
As a quick note, we will be taking next week off.

214
00:09:13.217 --> 00:09:16.958
Many of us have been working our butts off for a while,

215
00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.314
and some folks need a little break,

216
00:09:19.314 --> 00:09:21.553
and some folks are just traveling with family.

217
00:09:21.553 --> 00:09:23.956
There are a lot of vacations and little escapes

218
00:09:23.956 --> 00:09:25.630
all lined up, and we're like, let's just go ahead

219
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.968
and take the week off for all of us,

220
00:09:26.968 --> 00:09:28.645
for ourselves and our crew, who have been working tirelessly

221
00:09:28.645 --> 00:09:30.246
for the past few weeks with everything with the Kickstarter

222
00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:33.697
and the channel and everything. We will be dark

223
00:09:33.697 --> 00:09:38.018
March 28th, next Thursday, as well as the following Talks,

224
00:09:38.018 --> 00:09:40.900
April 2nd, will be dark as well. We'll be back returning

225
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.632
on our regular schedule the following week.

226
00:09:43.632 --> 00:09:45.687
April 4th will be the next episode after tonight.

227
00:09:45.687 --> 00:09:49.413
Enjoy the next two weeks, use that time to relax,

228
00:09:49.413 --> 00:09:52.122
use that time to, I don't know, watch other episodes

229
00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:54.078
or check out some of the other great streams out there,

230
00:09:54.078 --> 00:09:59.078
or get the rest of your family and friends indoctrinated.

231
00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:00.690
LIAM: I can finally get that colonic.

232
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.523
MATT: See?

233
00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:02.356
TRAVIS: Wow.

234
00:10:02.356 --> 00:10:04.259
LAURA: You've been talking that for so long.

235
00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:05.387
MATT: Hey, everything is content, right?

236
00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:08.426
SAM: I'm ready for it.

237
00:10:08.426 --> 00:10:11.011
LIAM: Do you know how many miniatures are trapped up there?

238
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.895
I need to flush it out.

239
00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:15.044
TRAVIS: Check your colons, kids.

240
00:10:15.044 --> 00:10:16.855
MATT: There's where the Thordak went.

241
00:10:16.855 --> 00:10:18.618
LIAM: Gelatinous cube is rough.

242
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.172
MARISHA: That would ruin a camera.

243
00:10:20.172 --> 00:10:24.247
MATT: And on that note.

244
00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:28.330
Let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of

245
00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:30.342
Critical Role.

246
00:10:32.592 --> 00:10:34.433
(water bubbling)

247
00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:35.266

248
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:40.658

(laughter)

270
00:12:09.163 --> 00:12:11.646
MATT: And welcome back, everybody.

271
00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:13.103
That was a team effort tonight, well done.

272
00:12:13.103 --> 00:12:15.049
LIAM: We will never stop doing that. We will never stop.

273
00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:16.272
MATT: I've noticed.

274
00:12:16.272 --> 00:12:18.227
I just accept it this point.

275
00:12:18.227 --> 00:12:20.381
No, this is my life now.

276
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:21.751
SAM: We'll be at your funeral and we will be--

277
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:22.584
MATT: I hope so!

278
00:12:22.584 --> 00:12:24.065
SAM: We will say cockbutter!

279
00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:24.898
MATT: Oh.

280
00:12:24.898 --> 00:12:26.112
(laughter)

281
00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:29.614
MATT: No, I did something horrible in a past life

282
00:12:29.614 --> 00:12:31.395
and I'm still paying penance.

283
00:12:31.395 --> 00:12:33.416
(laughter)

284
00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:34.376
LAURA: I'm using it. It's mine.

285
00:12:34.376 --> 00:12:35.731
LIAM: It's mine. It's a gift.

286
00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:36.564
LAURA: Too bad, I'm taking it.

287
00:12:36.564 --> 00:12:37.415
LIAM: Motherfucker...

288
00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:38.748
(laughter)

289
00:12:38.748 --> 00:12:39.581
MATT: So.

290
00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:42.595
Last we left off.

291
00:12:43.974 --> 00:12:48.974
The Mighty Nein, the intrepid cast of

292
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.036
unique and broken individuals, found their way east

293
00:12:52.036 --> 00:12:56.506
to the lands of Xhorhas, in search of the seemingly

294
00:12:56.506 --> 00:13:00.443
recently captured husband of Nott the Brave

295
00:13:00.443 --> 00:13:04.076
from a previous life, which seems to be held

296
00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:07.951
and is currently residing somewhere beneath Ghor Dranas.

297
00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:09.933
Upon traveling through subterranean tunnels

298
00:13:09.933 --> 00:13:12.170
under the mountain range of the Ashkeeper Peaks,

299
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.083
wandering past the dangers of the ashen wastes

300
00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:17.477
of the western side of Xhorhas, you made your way

301
00:13:17.477 --> 00:13:19.939
to the City of Beasts, Asarius, where you,

302
00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:21.631
under the guise of various illusions

303
00:13:21.631 --> 00:13:26.151
and/or just smeared mud, hid throughout the society,

304
00:13:26.151 --> 00:13:28.463
made some friends, purchased some moorbounder beasts

305
00:13:28.463 --> 00:13:32.488
as mounts, and underwent a conversation

306
00:13:32.488 --> 00:13:35.687
with one of the drow heads of the city,

307
00:13:35.687 --> 00:13:38.112
and accepted two contracts, it seems,

308
00:13:38.112 --> 00:13:39.825
to both gain gold and possibly favor

309
00:13:39.825 --> 00:13:42.108
with the Bright Queen Leylas Kryn herself.

310
00:13:42.108 --> 00:13:44.416
Whoever that may be.

311
00:13:44.416 --> 00:13:49.391
Upon searching for an Empire spy,

312
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:52.854
as one of these you discovered it to be Dairon, your mentor

313
00:13:52.854 --> 00:13:54.895
from the Cobalt Soul, and the other one

314
00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:57.920
enabled you to travel towards the north center of the city,

315
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.166
beneath the well there, to discover

316
00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:03.876
a source of this slow-rolling demonic incursion

317
00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:06.022
into the city of Asarius.

318
00:14:06.022 --> 00:14:09.128
There you did battle with a succubus and an incubus,

319
00:14:09.128 --> 00:14:12.965
as well as some sort of other demonic general entity

320
00:14:12.965 --> 00:14:15.263
that came through the portal.

321
00:14:15.263 --> 00:14:18.364
A very harsh battle ensued in which

322
00:14:18.364 --> 00:14:20.970
a number of members of your own party turned against you

323
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.536
under the charm effects of these demonic creatures.

324
00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:26.282
TRAVIS: Talking about you, dick.

325
00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.777
MATT: (laughs)

326
00:14:27.777 --> 00:14:32.098
At the end of this, all of you lay bruised and beaten,

327
00:14:32.098 --> 00:14:36.023
and Caduceus, snuffed, his life lost,

328
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.509
if not for the divine magics of Jester

329
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:41.948
and that one diamond you guys have been

330
00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:44.625
carrying around for a long time as components, you managed--

331
00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:45.472
SAM: And we don't have one now.

332
00:14:45.472 --> 00:14:46.305
MATT: No, you do not.

333
00:14:46.305 --> 00:14:47.828
LAURA: Caduceus still has one.

334
00:14:47.828 --> 00:14:48.661
MATT: Does he still have one?

335
00:14:48.661 --> 00:14:50.014
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we bought two.

336
00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:50.847
MATT: Good to know.

337
00:14:50.847 --> 00:14:52.347
SAM: Thank god.

338
00:14:53.555 --> 00:14:55.328
MATT: Pulling him from the jaws of death,

339
00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:57.896
you returned with a mild vision from the Wildmother,

340
00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.986
and you all, broken and beaten

341
00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:02.516
and not in a place to make much conversation,

342
00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:05.808
quickly made a night's rest here,

343
00:15:05.808 --> 00:15:10.058
in the seemingly now safe caverns beneath the city.

344
00:15:10.984 --> 00:15:13.969
So, you guys take your long rest,

345
00:15:13.969 --> 00:15:18.136
you can set yourselves at a full night's recovery.

346
00:15:21.117 --> 00:15:24.714
SAM: Before we sleep, or as we're sleeping,

347
00:15:24.714 --> 00:15:26.512
I just wanted to check with Caleb.

348
00:15:26.512 --> 00:15:30.533
Caleb, Caleb, I found this leather scroll.

349
00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:33.201
Would it be better for you to identify it now

350
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:34.818
or after we rest?

351
00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:38.569
It's in a language I can't understand,

352
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:41.765
I don't even know if it's a language at all.

353
00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:43.440
LIAM: Hand it over.

354
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.273
SAM: What?

355
00:15:44.273 --> 00:15:45.513
LIAM: (louder) Hand it over.

356
00:15:45.513 --> 00:15:46.614
SAM: Okay.

357
00:15:46.614 --> 00:15:49.447
Yes, please is always appreciated.

358
00:15:50.411 --> 00:15:51.769
(laughter)

359
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:53.794
LIAM: I pull the book out and I start to

360
00:15:53.794 --> 00:15:55.880
Ritual cast Identify.

361
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.713
MATT: Okay.

362
00:15:58.104 --> 00:16:00.061
SAM: This is before we went to sleep or after?

363
00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:01.819
LIAM: This is before going to sleep.

364
00:16:01.819 --> 00:16:02.850
SAM: Can't tell your morning voice

365
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.517
from your just-almost-died voice.

366
00:16:06.517 --> 00:16:09.487
LAURA: Yeah, from his I-was-controlled voice.

367
00:16:09.487 --> 00:16:11.933
LIAM: Wait, it's a scroll in a different language?

368
00:16:11.933 --> 00:16:12.970
MATT: Correct.

369
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.617
You use Identify--

370
00:16:14.617 --> 00:16:18.563
LIAM: I'll switch to Comprehend Languages instead.

371
00:16:18.563 --> 00:16:20.622
MATT: Okay, all right.

372
00:16:20.622 --> 00:16:25.348
It is Abyssal, and there's nothing magical about it.

373
00:16:25.348 --> 00:16:28.666
It does not contain any sort of spell or incantation.

374
00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:33.666
What it is is an incomplete, or at least a very limited

375
00:16:33.997 --> 00:16:38.389
portion of a construction instruction.

376
00:16:39.964 --> 00:16:42.117
Looking over it, and based on some of the things

377
00:16:42.117 --> 00:16:44.521
you had seen in the tunnel behind you,

378
00:16:44.521 --> 00:16:46.859
approaching this space, you gather that this was

379
00:16:46.859 --> 00:16:50.116
the next wave of development beneath the city

380
00:16:50.116 --> 00:16:52.736
in which a more permanent portal you saw

381
00:16:52.736 --> 00:16:55.376
being partially inscribed in the stone

382
00:16:55.376 --> 00:16:58.612
of the tunnels as you entered, this is the next wave

383
00:16:58.612 --> 00:16:59.997
of instructions that were to be given

384
00:16:59.997 --> 00:17:03.946
to essentially the away team that has been here locally.

385
00:17:03.946 --> 00:17:05.369
LIAM: Okay.

386
00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.040
SAM: Like how to build a portal?

387
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.431
MATT: It looks like more and more lines of the

388
00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:14.922
inscription runes that were going to be used

389
00:17:14.922 --> 00:17:16.919
in the next wave of preparing whatever was going

390
00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:18.227
to be the permanent portal.

391
00:17:18.227 --> 00:17:21.151
LIAM: Just to clarify, is it instructions to build

392
00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:23.714
the portal that we fucked up, or the thing

393
00:17:23.714 --> 00:17:25.593
after that portal?

394
00:17:25.593 --> 00:17:30.583
MATT: No, the permanent-- yeah, the archway

395
00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:33.571
that you saw the small demons carving into the rock.

396
00:17:33.571 --> 00:17:37.192
The object that you found is not referenced there at all,

397
00:17:37.192 --> 00:17:41.263
and while you know its purpose, the construction--

398
00:17:41.263 --> 00:17:44.817
there's something about it that seems strange.

399
00:17:44.817 --> 00:17:46.796
Like seeing fiendish construction,

400
00:17:46.796 --> 00:17:49.248
seeing things that are built or have some sort of

401
00:17:49.248 --> 00:17:51.533
an Abyssal influence in their design,

402
00:17:51.533 --> 00:17:55.783
what you discovered doesn't seem Abyssal in origin.

403
00:17:57.282 --> 00:17:59.259
TRAVIS: The scroll doesn't seem Abyssal in origin?

404
00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:00.940
SAM: No, the flying saucer.

405
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.952
MATT: Yeah, the silver disk.

406
00:18:02.952 --> 00:18:04.097
TRAVIS: Oh right, with the mercury in it.

407
00:18:04.097 --> 00:18:04.930
MATT: Correct.

408
00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:07.660
LIAM: That I will take, if we're going to bed,

409
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.276
10 more minutes to-- forget it, I will spend

410
00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:15.868
20 minutes or so to cast Detect Magic on it first,

411
00:18:17.273 --> 00:18:21.106
and after that-- well, just Detect Magic first.

412
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.655
MATT: On the scroll?
LIAM: On the disk.

413
00:18:23.655 --> 00:18:25.021
MATT: On the disk, there is very much a

414
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.593
magical essence to it. Yes.

415
00:18:26.593 --> 00:18:29.360
LIAM: What is the quality of the magic. Which school?

416
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.210
MATT: Conjuration.

417
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.344
LIAM: Conjuration, okay.

418
00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:34.737
Now I will finish the trio

419
00:18:34.737 --> 00:18:37.679
and do Identify to see if it is usable.

420
00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:40.512
MATT: It's usable in its current form.

421
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:43.812
Meaning it isn't something that you activate

422
00:18:43.812 --> 00:18:46.300
an effect happens. It is a generator

423
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.217
that begins to tear and bend different inner

424
00:18:51.217 --> 00:18:53.940
and outer planes based on its construction

425
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.356
to be closer together. This one is specifically tuned

426
00:18:56.356 --> 00:18:59.771
and built to draw towards some layer of the abyss.

427
00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:02.346
You're not able to ascertain specifically.

428
00:19:02.346 --> 00:19:05.695
Its construction seems a little haphazard.

429
00:19:05.695 --> 00:19:09.692
Almost like it was designed just barely to function,

430
00:19:09.692 --> 00:19:12.919
you know, cheaply, to get the job done,

431
00:19:12.919 --> 00:19:16.192
but it isn't a mighty artifact that's lasted eons.

432
00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:20.712
It looks like it's serviceable, but probably easily broken.

433
00:19:20.712 --> 00:19:23.811
LIAM: Are you saying that, Caleb examining it,

434
00:19:23.811 --> 00:19:27.756
I just see a piece of a puzzle and understand its purpose,

435
00:19:27.756 --> 00:19:31.638
but there's no specific way for me to use it.

436
00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:32.471
MATT: No.

437
00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:37.388
I mean, it's working now, and just its proximity begins to,

438
00:19:38.351 --> 00:19:40.849
and what you do learn is that it cannot be,

439
00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:42.262
at least the way this is designed,

440
00:19:42.262 --> 00:19:44.304
it cannot be focused to create or design

441
00:19:44.304 --> 00:19:46.883
or summon a specific portal.

442
00:19:46.883 --> 00:19:49.582
It just gradually, by its proximity,

443
00:19:49.582 --> 00:19:54.582
begins to shred the barrier between the planes.

444
00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:55.795
LIAM: I see.

445
00:19:57.261 --> 00:19:59.924
TRAVIS: What'd you find out?

446
00:19:59.924 --> 00:20:04.181
LIAM: It is some sort of a linchpin between here

447
00:20:04.181 --> 00:20:07.681
and, I don't know, the abyss.

448
00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:08.757
I don't know.

449
00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:12.571
It's the best piece of evidence we have, yeah?

450
00:20:12.571 --> 00:20:13.404
SAM: Mm-hmm.

451
00:20:13.404 --> 00:20:16.262
TRAVIS: For sure, did that piece of paper say anything?

452
00:20:16.262 --> 00:20:17.095
Like...

453
00:20:19.108 --> 00:20:22.454
LIAM: It just laid out what we stumbled on down here.

454
00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:26.632
These things are taking instructions from someone.

455
00:20:26.632 --> 00:20:28.415
MARISHA: You think it still counts as good evidence

456
00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:30.415
if we break it a little?

457
00:20:31.489 --> 00:20:34.353
We've got the plans. We've got the rune rubbings,

458
00:20:34.353 --> 00:20:37.603
we'd have a, you know, broken artifact.

459
00:20:39.373 --> 00:20:42.968
TRAVIS: Probably not as much, not as impressive

460
00:20:42.968 --> 00:20:44.759
as if it's intact.

461
00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:46.033
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

462
00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:50.426
SAM: Caleb, in your expert opinion, if that disk thing,

463
00:20:50.426 --> 00:20:52.959
if that stays in one place for a while,

464
00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:56.726
will it eventually a burrow a hole into the

465
00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:01.627
portal into another dimension?

466
00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:03.130
Like should we keep moving it around

467
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.380
so it doesn't like just stay put and just sort of--

468
00:21:08.455 --> 00:21:10.705
LIAM: I'm afraid I do not know.

469
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.056
SAM: That's a monster coming through to attack us.

470
00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:17.164
LAURA: That's a monster. That's somebody peeking

471
00:21:17.164 --> 00:21:18.272
out of a vagina.

472
00:21:18.272 --> 00:21:19.659
SAM: It's a monster coming to attack us.

473
00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:20.886
There's nothing more.

474
00:21:20.886 --> 00:21:22.114
TRAVIS: Yeah, no no no.

475
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.405
Do you remember when that nasty thing stuck its head through

476
00:21:24.405 --> 00:21:28.305
and it said like, is it ready or is it complete?

477
00:21:28.305 --> 00:21:30.956
Like he was asking them if something was being finished.

478
00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.197
LAURA: The portal. The thing with the blueprints.

479
00:21:33.197 --> 00:21:34.063
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:36.977
TRAVIS: Is that it?

481
00:21:36.977 --> 00:21:37.881
LAURA: I think so.

482
00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:39.511
MARISHA: I'd imagine so.

483
00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:41.946
LAURA: That's what those little guys were building, yeah?

484
00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:42.779
SAM: Mm-hmm.

485
00:21:43.649 --> 00:21:44.585
TRAVIS: All right.

486
00:21:44.585 --> 00:21:46.466
MARISHA: I'm just wondering how widespread

487
00:21:46.466 --> 00:21:48.982
this incursion was planning on being.

488
00:21:48.982 --> 00:21:50.899
TRAVIS: How'd the device get here in the first place?

489
00:21:50.899 --> 00:21:51.973
Somebody had to put it here, right?

490
00:21:51.973 --> 00:21:54.213
MARISHA: Someone had to put it here.

491
00:21:54.213 --> 00:21:55.500
LIAM: Maybe they mean to take the city.

492
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.412
We found those dogs or whatever they were

493
00:21:58.412 --> 00:22:01.205
in another place entirely here.

494
00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:03.213
TRAVIS: Can you check it for fingerprints

495
00:22:03.213 --> 00:22:05.267
or anything like that?

496
00:22:05.267 --> 00:22:06.100
LIAM: What?

497
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.277
TRAVIS: You know, like, you know--

498
00:22:07.277 --> 00:22:09.735
MARISHA: Let me get out my CSI dusting kit.

499
00:22:09.735 --> 00:22:13.273
TRAVIS: Can you cast a spell to see who held it last?

500
00:22:13.273 --> 00:22:14.106
SAM: Ooh.

501
00:22:14.106 --> 00:22:16.518
TRAVIS: Like who the previous owner was?

502
00:22:16.518 --> 00:22:19.077
Do you have any of that in your books?

503
00:22:19.077 --> 00:22:22.587
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm going to bed, and I just sort of

504
00:22:22.587 --> 00:22:25.329
lie down and collapse on the ground.

505
00:22:25.329 --> 00:22:29.183
LAURA: I could cast Zone of Truth on the apparatus.

506
00:22:29.183 --> 00:22:30.718
TRAVIS: What would that do?

507
00:22:30.718 --> 00:22:31.937
LAURA: Nothing at all.

508
00:22:31.937 --> 00:22:33.706
(laughter)

509
00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:37.410
SAM: I'm just worried if we go to sleep and we lay it here,

510
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.734
it's going to just slowly start opening a portal.

511
00:22:39.734 --> 00:22:41.199
Like shouldn't we just move it around

512
00:22:41.199 --> 00:22:43.085
a little bit so it can't?

513
00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:44.643
Or just, we decided we were going to put it

514
00:22:44.643 --> 00:22:46.132
in the box, right?

515
00:22:46.132 --> 00:22:47.759
LAURA: We're going to put it in the lead box.

516
00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:49.087
SAM: Okay, that should be enough.

517
00:22:49.087 --> 00:22:51.555
I know magic enough to know that we're kosher.

518
00:22:51.555 --> 00:22:52.604
LAURA: That is A-okay.

519
00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:55.354
LIAM: Set it outside the dome a foot.

520
00:22:56.787 --> 00:22:57.631
SAM: All right.

521
00:22:57.631 --> 00:22:58.464
Let's do it.

522
00:22:58.464 --> 00:22:59.397
TRAVIS: All right.

523
00:22:59.397 --> 00:23:00.349
SAM: Sleep.
MATT: All right.

524
00:23:00.349 --> 00:23:05.253
MATT: You guys all, within the safety of Caleb's dome,

525
00:23:05.253 --> 00:23:08.633
his magical hut, you all find yourselves

526
00:23:08.633 --> 00:23:11.383
resting for the night, exhausted.

527
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:14.960
The next morning, who knows what hour,

528
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.099
except for you, you'd know, because fucking feat.

529
00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:19.433
By the time you guys come to consciousness

530
00:23:19.433 --> 00:23:23.472
it's more than eight hours, just-- oh man.

531
00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:24.438
SAM: A bigger flask.

532
00:23:24.438 --> 00:23:27.259
(laughter)

533
00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:28.971
SAM: Stretch goals.

534
00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:30.496
Stretch goals.

535
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:31.496
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

536
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.106
LAURA: Do you have to keep both of the flasks

537
00:23:34.106 --> 00:23:35.482
on the table still, or--

538
00:23:35.482 --> 00:23:39.051
SAM: I will have to keep all three of them soon, I hope.

539
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:40.814
(laughter)

540
00:23:40.814 --> 00:23:42.198
TRAVIS: Will you have to drink all of the contents

541
00:23:42.198 --> 00:23:43.031
in a single game?

542
00:23:43.031 --> 00:23:45.146
SAM: Oh no, oh god.

543
00:23:45.146 --> 00:23:46.822
TRAVIS: I think so. That's what Lyft is for.

544
00:23:46.822 --> 00:23:49.492
LIAM: Once again my opponent focuses on the superficial

545
00:23:49.492 --> 00:23:50.992
and not substance.

546
00:23:52.188 --> 00:23:53.476
You know what to do.

547
00:23:53.476 --> 00:23:54.435
LIAM: You're a flip-flopper, Liam.

548
00:23:54.435 --> 00:23:56.693
(laughter)

549
00:23:56.693 --> 00:23:57.526
TRAVIS: Sorry.

550
00:23:57.526 --> 00:23:58.448
LIAM: Only in bed.

551
00:23:58.448 --> 00:23:59.783
MATT: So.

552
00:23:59.783 --> 00:24:00.634
Hmm?

553
00:24:00.634 --> 00:24:02.280
So.

554
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.972
Coming to consciousness, you Caleb--

555
00:24:04.972 --> 00:24:08.113
LAURA: I give Caleb the side-eye.

556
00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:10.673
I'm just keeping eyes on him.

557
00:24:10.673 --> 00:24:11.517
LAURA: Okay.

558
00:24:11.517 --> 00:24:13.517
Make a Perception check.

559
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:16.514
LAURA: Oh, that's way--
MATT: That's super cocked.

560
00:24:16.514 --> 00:24:17.347
LAURA: Way.

561
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.461
SAM: The worst dice.

562
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:22.637
LAURA: I love it! Shut up, it was cool.

563
00:24:22.637 --> 00:24:24.708
I got a really bad roll on it, though.

564
00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:26.179
(laughter)

565
00:24:26.179 --> 00:24:27.495
LAURA: That was what, a Perception?

566
00:24:27.495 --> 00:24:28.328
MATT: Yes.

567
00:24:28.328 --> 00:24:29.161
LAURA: Yeah, eight.

568
00:24:29.161 --> 00:24:30.109
MATT: Eight, all right.

569
00:24:30.109 --> 00:24:31.198
He's sleeping pretty hard.

570
00:24:31.198 --> 00:24:32.447
Everybody is.

571
00:24:32.447 --> 00:24:34.070
You're a little distracted, because on the ground

572
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.665
not far from you is Caduceus, who is super exhausted

573
00:24:36.665 --> 00:24:38.453
and snoring super loud.

574
00:24:38.453 --> 00:24:41.007
(imitates snoring)

575
00:24:41.007 --> 00:24:43.607
LIAM: Frumpkin is also purring furiously all night.

576
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:44.440
MATT: There you go.

577
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.167
You're surrounded by a haphazard motors.

578
00:24:46.167 --> 00:24:47.000
LAURA: Yeah.

579
00:24:48.055 --> 00:24:50.295
MATT: As consciousness comes to you the next morning,

580
00:24:50.295 --> 00:24:53.764
a good solid 12 hours or so of sleep is needed

581
00:24:53.764 --> 00:24:56.255
as you guys just run through exhausted

582
00:24:56.255 --> 00:24:59.323
after the battle the night before.

583
00:24:59.323 --> 00:25:01.521
This would put you guys, after your combat and rest,

584
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:03.438
probably mid-afternoon.

585
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.129
You do also notice that the corpses of the--

586
00:25:10.129 --> 00:25:13.043
I believe that's four hours of sleep

587
00:25:13.043 --> 00:25:14.825
that you did not have the dome.

588
00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:15.685
LIAM: Not protected, yeah.

589
00:25:15.685 --> 00:25:16.518
MATT: Yes, but you fell asleep.

590
00:25:16.518 --> 00:25:17.351
LIAM: I was looking it up.

591
00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:19.684
MATT: But no issues, thankfully.

592
00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:23.541
The corpses of the demons you had fought before

593
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:25.282
are now black sludge.

594
00:25:25.282 --> 00:25:26.265
SAM: Ew.

595
00:25:26.265 --> 00:25:27.951
MATT: Rapidly through the night they have decomposed

596
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:31.776
into a thick black ichor and just seeped into the dust

597
00:25:31.776 --> 00:25:34.924
and dirt of the chamber floor.

598
00:25:34.924 --> 00:25:39.560
The heart of the demon still remains,

599
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.865
if only because of the electricity that was used to tear it,

600
00:25:42.865 --> 00:25:44.562
or that was within the body of the creature

601
00:25:44.562 --> 00:25:47.234
when you tore it out, seemed to have cauterized

602
00:25:47.234 --> 00:25:48.720
it to some point, and also because it's cool

603
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.854
to let you keep a demon heart.

604
00:25:49.854 --> 00:25:51.107
(laughter)

605
00:25:51.107 --> 00:25:52.909
MATT: I'm not going to be a total dick, it's just cool

606
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:53.986
to have a demon heart that you tore out.

607
00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:55.684
(laughter)

608
00:25:55.684 --> 00:25:57.101
MATT: So I'll allow it.

609
00:25:59.607 --> 00:26:03.649
Other than that, it is a quiet, sore,

610
00:26:04.605 --> 00:26:07.387
cold, subterranean morning greeting you

611
00:26:07.387 --> 00:26:10.304
in the mid-afternoon under Asarius.

612
00:26:12.762 --> 00:26:16.179
TRAVIS: Well, that was a shit string of events.

613
00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:18.632
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

614
00:26:18.632 --> 00:26:21.693
TRAVIS: Should we go back up top and turn in our findings

615
00:26:21.693 --> 00:26:24.037
and get this rescue mission back on track

616
00:26:24.037 --> 00:26:25.787
with a favor to boot?

617
00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:32.213
SAM: Yes, but before we do, maybe we should just,

618
00:26:32.213 --> 00:26:35.698
so this doesn't happen again, maybe we should have

619
00:26:35.698 --> 00:26:38.465
like a code word with each other,

620
00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:43.459
in case you're taken over by another being or something,

621
00:26:43.459 --> 00:26:46.607
your mind is controlled, like there's a challenge word

622
00:26:46.607 --> 00:26:47.440
and a reply.

623
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.273
TRAVIS: Yeah.

624
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:49.647
SAM: And if you don't say that reply,

625
00:26:49.647 --> 00:26:52.296
I know you're a bad guy and I kill you.

626
00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:53.872
LAURA: That's really smart!

627
00:26:53.872 --> 00:26:56.269
TRAVIS: What about like octo, and you say--

628
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:57.998
MARISHA: Puss.
SAM: Pussy.

629
00:26:59.106 --> 00:27:00.258
SAM: No?

630
00:27:00.258 --> 00:27:02.539
TRAVIS: What about ella, and you say--

631
00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:03.563
MARISHA: Puss.
SAM: Pussy.

632
00:27:03.563 --> 00:27:05.096
(laughter)

633
00:27:05.096 --> 00:27:06.411
TRAVIS: Wow, no phant?

634
00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:07.244
Okay.

635
00:27:08.144 --> 00:27:09.477
How about hairy?

636
00:27:11.772 --> 00:27:13.282
LAURA: Dog.
MARISHA: Puss.

637
00:27:13.282 --> 00:27:14.849
SAM: Dog is good, hairy dog.

638
00:27:14.849 --> 00:27:18.369
LAURA: Hairy dog is usually where I would go with that.

639
00:27:18.369 --> 00:27:20.202
TRAVIS: What about smugglin'--

640
00:27:20.202 --> 00:27:21.043
LAURA: Pussy.

641
00:27:21.043 --> 00:27:23.582
(laughter)

642
00:27:23.582 --> 00:27:25.190
TRAVIS: I'm tryin' here. I'm just coming up

643
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:26.323
with the same shit.

644
00:27:26.323 --> 00:27:29.488
LIAM: What happens if the first word is pussy?

645
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.193
LAURA: Pussy. (laughs)

646
00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:33.156
TRAVIS: Smuggler.

647
00:27:33.156 --> 00:27:34.891
(laughter)

648
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:37.430
SAM: All right, we've got a couple options there.

649
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.584
Basically if you think your friend is mind controlled,

650
00:27:41.584 --> 00:27:44.318
say anything to them, and if they don't say pussy back,

651
00:27:44.318 --> 00:27:45.401
kill them.

652
00:27:45.401 --> 00:27:47.876
TRAVIS: Quick point of order, I think if you are charmed

653
00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:50.789
or controlled in the same way that our friend Caleb was

654
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:53.257
yesterday, I don't believe you'll be able

655
00:27:53.257 --> 00:27:54.509
to say that word, right?

656
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:56.149
LAURA: Right, I don't think you will.

657
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.982
SAM: Definitely not, no.

658
00:27:56.982 --> 00:27:58.445
LIAM: I disagree, I was in complete control

659
00:27:58.445 --> 00:28:01.615
of my mind and faculties, and I would have known to say

660
00:28:01.615 --> 00:28:04.226
"pussy smuggler" if it was the time to say it.

661
00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:06.476
(laughter)

662
00:28:11.577 --> 00:28:15.527
TRAVIS: Look, the DM is dangerously holding

663
00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:16.969
a d20, maybe we should--

664
00:28:16.969 --> 00:28:20.008
MATT: No, I just, this is just a very pretty die.

665
00:28:20.008 --> 00:28:20.841
SAM: Let's continue on.

666
00:28:20.841 --> 00:28:22.357
LIAM: Sure it is, Vecna!

667
00:28:22.357 --> 00:28:23.190
(laughter)

668
00:28:24.404 --> 00:28:26.604
TRAVIS: We will make our way up out of

669
00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:30.100
the cavern back (exaggerated accent) topside.

670
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.275
(laughter)

671
00:28:31.275 --> 00:28:32.271
LAURA: How does Caleb look?

672
00:28:32.271 --> 00:28:34.081
I mean, not Caleb, how does Caduceus look?

673
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:38.601
MATT: Caduceus is beat to shit, but slowly conscious,

674
00:28:38.601 --> 00:28:40.993
sitting up, in the process of pulling out

675
00:28:40.993 --> 00:28:42.836
and like fiddling with some tea,

676
00:28:42.836 --> 00:28:47.486
and just looks over and goes, "Oh, hey."

677
00:28:47.486 --> 00:28:50.053
LAURA: How do you feel, Caduceus?

678
00:28:50.053 --> 00:28:51.053
MATT: "I'm alive.

679
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.552
"That's pretty good."

680
00:28:53.552 --> 00:28:54.462
(laughter)

681
00:28:54.462 --> 00:28:57.104
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty nice, pretty nice.

682
00:28:57.104 --> 00:28:59.584
MATT: "I appreciate that."

683
00:28:59.584 --> 00:29:04.001
SAM: I'm sorry that I accidentally killed you yesterday.

684
00:29:06.832 --> 00:29:07.915
MATT: "Things die.

685
00:29:08.859 --> 00:29:10.109
"Some come back.

686
00:29:11.095 --> 00:29:12.426
"We'll talk later."

687
00:29:12.426 --> 00:29:14.023
(laughter)

688
00:29:14.023 --> 00:29:15.674
I don't want to do this moment without Taliesin.

689
00:29:15.674 --> 00:29:17.032
SAM: Wow, it's so good!

690
00:29:17.032 --> 00:29:18.833
TRAVIS: It's okay, tea happens.

691
00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:20.182
(laughter)

692
00:29:20.182 --> 00:29:21.015
SAM: Pussy.

693
00:29:21.015 --> 00:29:22.342
TRAVIS: No, all right.

694
00:29:22.342 --> 00:29:23.975
(laughter)

695
00:29:25.094 --> 00:29:28.773
MATT: He slowly gets up and (groaning).

696
00:29:28.773 --> 00:29:32.543
Crick in his back, stretches a bit.

697
00:29:32.543 --> 00:29:35.056
What are you guys doing?

698
00:29:35.056 --> 00:29:36.994
SAM: We have to get out of this well.

699
00:29:36.994 --> 00:29:40.050
LAURA: Yeah, let's get up and out, I guess.

700
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.227
SAM: We should go see Lady Zethriss Olios.

701
00:29:43.227 --> 00:29:46.591
TRAVIS: Before we get out, I'll sidle up next to Caleb

702
00:29:46.591 --> 00:29:51.591
and just say hey, how'd that feel yesterday

703
00:29:52.021 --> 00:29:56.188
when you were all, you know, launching shit at us?

704
00:29:58.989 --> 00:29:59.906
LIAM: Not good.

705
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.638
I was there, but it didn't matter.

706
00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:06.471
Not good.

707
00:30:08.817 --> 00:30:12.817
TRAVIS: You ever had anything like that happen before?

708
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:19.384
LIAM: Hmm.

709
00:30:20.252 --> 00:30:21.085
No.

710
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.620
Not like that, no.

711
00:30:26.006 --> 00:30:30.520
TRAVIS: Not like that, like having your faculties overtaken?

712
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.331
LIAM: No, I have never been controlled

713
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:35.664
through arcane means before.

714
00:30:37.385 --> 00:30:39.993
LAURA: Did it feel like you wanted to do it,

715
00:30:39.993 --> 00:30:43.503
or did it feel like you wanted to fight it?

716
00:30:43.503 --> 00:30:46.420
LIAM: I was actually frightened of you.

717
00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:48.372
TRAVIS: Huh.

718
00:30:48.372 --> 00:30:51.508
LIAM: It made me frightened of you.

719
00:30:51.508 --> 00:30:53.758
LAURA: Well, we are pretty scary.

720
00:30:56.106 --> 00:30:58.138
SAM: But you feel better now, you know

721
00:30:58.138 --> 00:31:00.305
that we're friends, right?

722
00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:06.814
No lingering effects, no PTS...

723
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.703
LAURA: No itchy fireballs? (laughs)

724
00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.199
LIAM: No.

725
00:31:13.199 --> 00:31:15.032
No, I'm fine, I'm me.

726
00:31:16.545 --> 00:31:19.586
I'm me. Check on our big friend over there.

727
00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:20.725
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha.

728
00:31:20.725 --> 00:31:23.164
MATT: Yasha currently stretching, getting up

729
00:31:23.164 --> 00:31:24.708
and getting the Magician's Judge

730
00:31:24.708 --> 00:31:26.774
and sheathing it and standing up,

731
00:31:26.774 --> 00:31:28.984
and just been listening in to this conversation

732
00:31:28.984 --> 00:31:30.274
and as you all glance over,

733
00:31:30.274 --> 00:31:33.490
all eyes cast upon her, she just,

734
00:31:35.499 --> 00:31:40.307
"Sorry. Sorry."

735
00:31:41.374 --> 00:31:43.406
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, you know, it's all

736
00:31:43.406 --> 00:31:46.897
water under the bridge, yesterday's events.

737
00:31:46.897 --> 00:31:49.015
LAURA: It could've happened to any of us.

738
00:31:49.015 --> 00:31:50.182
SAM: That's true.

739
00:31:51.721 --> 00:31:53.639
TRAVIS: We'll be more prepared next time.

740
00:31:53.639 --> 00:31:55.593
SAM: Somehow.
LAURA: How?

741
00:31:55.593 --> 00:31:57.401
TRAVIS: I just put it out there.

742
00:31:57.401 --> 00:31:59.084
I don't actually have an answer.

743
00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.857
MARISAH: I mean, we might be able to find something

744
00:32:00.857 --> 00:32:04.973
that could help with not being so easily swayed.

745
00:32:04.973 --> 00:32:08.329
MATT: "Well, I mean, now that we know,

746
00:32:08.329 --> 00:32:11.996
"next time we come across anything like this,

747
00:32:13.713 --> 00:32:18.055
"maybe I can try and help out a bit."

748
00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:21.934
LAURA: Yeah! You have awesome spells.

749
00:32:21.934 --> 00:32:23.281
MATT: "Oh, thank you."

750
00:32:24.257 --> 00:32:26.507
(laughter)

751
00:32:27.429 --> 00:32:29.359
SAM: All right, let's go.
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

752
00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:30.832
SAM: Let's get out of here.

753
00:32:30.832 --> 00:32:32.287
TRAVIS: Yee-haw!

754
00:32:32.287 --> 00:32:35.056
MATT: You guys make your way back

755
00:32:35.056 --> 00:32:37.529
towards the tunnel where you had originally entered,

756
00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:41.532
make your way towards the entrance of this cavern

757
00:32:41.532 --> 00:32:44.521
that is pressed against the exterior wall of the well,

758
00:32:44.521 --> 00:32:48.262
about 15 feet down, right where the water level hits.

759
00:32:48.262 --> 00:32:52.956
The well, the bucket is currently up,

760
00:32:52.956 --> 00:32:56.437
it is currently wound up, and you look up

761
00:32:56.437 --> 00:33:00.504
through the 15 feet of space before it reaches the surface,

762
00:33:00.504 --> 00:33:02.571
and you can see the gray sky ahead.

763
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:04.935
MARISHA: How wide across is the well?

764
00:33:04.935 --> 00:33:07.252
MATT: It's about four feet across, I think.

765
00:33:07.252 --> 00:33:08.482
LAURA: Oh, we could do this.

766
00:33:08.482 --> 00:33:12.017
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to do the monk Ninja Warrior thing.

767
00:33:12.017 --> 00:33:14.495
MATT: Sure, make an acrobatics check.

768
00:33:14.495 --> 00:33:16.489
This would be athletics, actually.

769
00:33:16.489 --> 00:33:18.537
LAURA: I'm going to follow behind her doing the same thing.

770
00:33:18.537 --> 00:33:21.977
MARISHA: Okay. 22.

771
00:33:21.977 --> 00:33:23.573
MATT: Yeah, without issue.

772
00:33:23.573 --> 00:33:26.556
You guys are like, "Ah," Beau's like, "I got this."

773
00:33:26.556 --> 00:33:28.638
LAURA: Oh, that's how you do it? Okay.

774
00:33:28.638 --> 00:33:32.138
MATT: Make an athletics check for you as well.

775
00:33:33.557 --> 00:33:36.676
LAURA: Oh, wow, that was, okay good.

776
00:33:36.676 --> 00:33:37.575
20.

777
00:33:37.575 --> 00:33:39.258
MATT: Now, it's interesting.

778
00:33:39.258 --> 00:33:41.158
Your arm span is just wide enough

779
00:33:41.158 --> 00:33:43.822
where you can reach the sides,

780
00:33:43.822 --> 00:33:45.581
and usually you'd have a hard time

781
00:33:45.581 --> 00:33:49.214
keeping the pressure there, but you're pretty beefy.

782
00:33:49.214 --> 00:33:50.047
LAURA: I'm so beefy.

783
00:33:50.047 --> 00:33:52.008
MATT: You just (impacting).

784
00:33:52.008 --> 00:33:53.340
It takes a little longer than Beau,

785
00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.552
but you do manage to make your way up and out the well

786
00:33:55.552 --> 00:33:57.746
through your own physical locomotion.

787
00:33:57.746 --> 00:34:00.716
MARISHA: When I get to the top, I want to slowly

788
00:34:00.716 --> 00:34:04.933
peek my head up, and look around

789
00:34:04.933 --> 00:34:07.957
and see if anyone's watching or how suspicious this looks.

790
00:34:07.957 --> 00:34:10.485
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

791
00:34:10.485 --> 00:34:12.658
I was rolling for Yasha, it's fine.

792
00:34:12.658 --> 00:34:14.325
MARISHA: Natural 20.

793
00:34:15.291 --> 00:34:16.581
MATT: Nice!
LIAM: Girl!

794
00:34:16.581 --> 00:34:18.211
MARISHA: What's up, what's up.

795
00:34:18.211 --> 00:34:19.946
MATT: You don't see anyone

796
00:34:19.946 --> 00:34:23.113
suspiciously looking in this vicinity.

797
00:34:24.351 --> 00:34:26.275
Natural 20, okay, hold on.

798
00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:30.400
TRAVIS: Yeah! My ass he's rolling for Yasha.

799
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.024
SAM: Guys, go subscribe to D&amp;D Beyond right now

800
00:34:33.024 --> 00:34:34.836
while the whisper's happening.

801
00:34:34.836 --> 00:34:36.645
It only takes a moment.

802
00:34:36.645 --> 00:34:37.982
You'll have a new subscription

803
00:34:37.982 --> 00:34:40.665
by the time Matt sits back down.

804
00:34:40.665 --> 00:34:42.992
♪ Buh buh buh ba bum ♪

805
00:34:42.992 --> 00:34:45.394
♪ Bum bum bum ba bum ♪

806
00:34:45.394 --> 00:34:47.995
That's a big whisper for a perception check.

807
00:34:47.995 --> 00:34:48.828
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know.

808
00:34:48.828 --> 00:34:51.372
SAM: What the fuck is she seeing?

809
00:34:51.372 --> 00:34:52.608
TRAVIS: Which one of those pictures is older,

810
00:34:52.608 --> 00:34:53.684
the left or the right?

811
00:34:53.684 --> 00:34:54.767
MARISHA: Interesting.

812
00:34:54.767 --> 00:34:56.434
TRAVIS: You'll never know.

813
00:34:57.469 --> 00:34:59.462
MARISHA: Jester and I get up.

814
00:34:59.462 --> 00:35:01.456
MATT: Yep, you guys get up, Yasha climbs up after you.

815
00:35:01.456 --> 00:35:04.380
LAURA: My butt hits Beau, my head hits Beau's butt.

816
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.088
MARISHA: (grunts) Oh, sorry.

817
00:35:06.088 --> 00:35:07.171
LAURA: Sorry.

818
00:35:08.475 --> 00:35:11.332
MATT: Yasha instinctually hears that and goes, "Sorry."

819
00:35:11.332 --> 00:35:14.574
She's been apologizing a lot.

820
00:35:14.574 --> 00:35:16.917
MARISHA: I send the bucket down for the rest.

821
00:35:16.917 --> 00:35:18.037
MATT: All right.

822
00:35:18.037 --> 00:35:19.925
You guys, one by one, easy enough with the help

823
00:35:19.925 --> 00:35:21.049
of the rest of your party, you make your way

824
00:35:21.049 --> 00:35:23.852
out of the well and back onto the streets

825
00:35:23.852 --> 00:35:25.542
near the center of Asarius.

826
00:35:25.542 --> 00:35:27.302
What'd you get?

827
00:35:27.302 --> 00:35:28.138
TRAVIS: Six.

828
00:35:28.138 --> 00:35:29.342
MATT: Well you didn't have to roll for it, you're fine,

829
00:35:29.342 --> 00:35:31.602
they were helping.
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

830
00:35:31.602 --> 00:35:35.029
MARISHA: While they get up, while they climb the rope,

831
00:35:35.029 --> 00:35:37.482
I'm just going to say: You guys got it, yeah?

832
00:35:37.482 --> 00:35:41.150
Yeah, okay, bye. I grab Jester by the arm

833
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:43.871
and I pull her across the road a little bit.

834
00:35:43.871 --> 00:35:45.982
LAURA: What's going on?

835
00:35:45.982 --> 00:35:49.100
MARISHA: Where's your thingy, your medallion,

836
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.075
your symbol thingy?

837
00:35:50.075 --> 00:35:52.649
The Traveler--
LAURA: Oh, it's on my belt.

838
00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:54.399
MARISHA: I look at it.

839
00:35:55.298 --> 00:35:57.178
LAURA: What about it?

840
00:35:57.178 --> 00:35:59.095
MARISHA: Is that the same one?

841
00:36:00.539 --> 00:36:01.886
MATT: You glance across the street

842
00:36:01.886 --> 00:36:03.988
and between two of the buildings there's a hut,

843
00:36:03.988 --> 00:36:07.460
like a hut made of stone and a thatched roof,

844
00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.595
it looks old and weathered, and there is a wooden door

845
00:36:10.595 --> 00:36:13.767
and on the door you see, hanging from a metal ring,

846
00:36:13.767 --> 00:36:16.250
at first glance it looks like a meal bell,

847
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.125
like a dinner bell type thing,

848
00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:21.237
but it's a little archway

849
00:36:21.237 --> 00:36:23.753
with a little path running through it

850
00:36:23.753 --> 00:36:25.459
with the horizon in the center.

851
00:36:25.459 --> 00:36:27.167
MARISHA and LAURA: (excited babbling)

852
00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:28.125
MARISHA: I know!

853
00:36:28.125 --> 00:36:30.731
LAURA: I take off towards it.

854
00:36:30.731 --> 00:36:33.646
MARISHA: I power walk behind.

855
00:36:33.646 --> 00:36:36.209
MATT: Okay. All right.

856
00:36:36.209 --> 00:36:37.983
MARISHA: Still looking around.

857
00:36:37.983 --> 00:36:39.380
MATT: You go ahead and make your way there.

858
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:44.249
You push past this heavy pair of oxen that are (groaning)

859
00:36:44.249 --> 00:36:45.817
making their way across the street

860
00:36:45.817 --> 00:36:49.472
with a cart wheeling behind. You see this large orc

861
00:36:49.472 --> 00:36:50.305
that, "Hey!"

862
00:36:50.305 --> 00:36:52.430
LAURA: I go under his legs.

863
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.786
MATT: (grunting)

864
00:36:53.786 --> 00:36:55.522
MARISHA: Sorry, sir.

865
00:36:55.522 --> 00:36:58.762
MATT: (reins cracking) and takes the reins

866
00:36:58.762 --> 00:37:00.463
and pushes them a little further,

867
00:37:00.463 --> 00:37:02.083
you guys move past that as the (squeaking)

868
00:37:02.083 --> 00:37:04.643
wheeling continues on.

869
00:37:04.643 --> 00:37:06.760
LIAM: Man, I saw all of that.

870
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.954
MATT: You make your way to the door, and it's a door.

871
00:37:10.954 --> 00:37:13.495
LAURA: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.

872
00:37:13.495 --> 00:37:16.019
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

873
00:37:16.019 --> 00:37:17.367
TRAVIS: Jesus.

874
00:37:17.367 --> 00:37:18.313
MATT: (squeaks)

875
00:37:18.313 --> 00:37:20.470
Super dark inside, you just see a little bit of

876
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.943
spackled gray and brown fur and this big

877
00:37:23.943 --> 00:37:27.217
cloudy eye glance through and go,

878
00:37:27.217 --> 00:37:28.725
"Hello?"

879
00:37:28.725 --> 00:37:29.558
LAURA: Hello?

880
00:37:32.495 --> 00:37:35.286
Oh em gee.

881
00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:38.303
MATT: The eye squints a bit and it rotates

882
00:37:38.303 --> 00:37:41.673
and goes to the other eye, which is not as cloudy, and goes,

883
00:37:41.673 --> 00:37:43.461
"What's that?"

884
00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:44.545
LAURA: What do you think it is?

885
00:37:44.545 --> 00:37:48.107
What is on your door right here, man?

886
00:37:48.107 --> 00:37:49.873
MATT: (creaking) The door pulls open and you see now

887
00:37:49.873 --> 00:37:52.511
hunched down in the doorway

888
00:37:52.511 --> 00:37:55.476
an elderly gnoll, the hair mostly white and gray,

889
00:37:55.476 --> 00:37:59.084
this heavy walking cane, its crooked stick on the side.

890
00:37:59.084 --> 00:38:04.084
You see bits of the snout where the fur's fallen out,

891
00:38:04.091 --> 00:38:07.299
the wrinkled skin and some of the spots

892
00:38:07.299 --> 00:38:09.726
that are coming through a bit of the snout.

893
00:38:09.726 --> 00:38:12.301
Some of the gums are missing teeth and are blackened.

894
00:38:12.301 --> 00:38:14.319
This is older and not in the best health,

895
00:38:14.319 --> 00:38:18.216
and the smell is awful too.

896
00:38:18.216 --> 00:38:20.306
LAURA: Yeah, that would be some stinky breath.

897
00:38:20.306 --> 00:38:23.582
MATT: Some stinky halitosis breath, yeah.

898
00:38:23.582 --> 00:38:27.123
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Elderly gnoll.

899
00:38:27.123 --> 00:38:28.740
MATT: The sequel has been found.

900
00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.111
LIAM: Not regular.

901
00:38:30.111 --> 00:38:33.561
MATT: The other hand grabs the doorway and peeks through,

902
00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:35.793
the elongated neck of the the gnoll creeping in,

903
00:38:35.793 --> 00:38:40.293
looking it over. "Are you a friend of the Traveler?"

904
00:38:41.496 --> 00:38:43.171
LAURA: Are you?

905
00:38:45.989 --> 00:38:47.350
MATT: "Come in, come in."

906
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.067
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay!

907
00:38:49.067 --> 00:38:50.731
Can Beau come in, too?

908
00:38:50.731 --> 00:38:52.086
She's also really cool and she also

909
00:38:52.086 --> 00:38:53.993
sort of likes the Traveler sometimes.

910
00:38:53.993 --> 00:38:57.310
MATT: "You also follow the Traveler?"

911
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.293
MARISHA: Yeah, well, I follow Jester,

912
00:39:00.293 --> 00:39:03.301
and whoever she follows, I follow.

913
00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:05.663
LAURA: I'm gathering a small army of Traveler followers

914
00:39:05.663 --> 00:39:07.600
and she is one of them, actually.

915
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.948
MATT: "Sure, come on in."

916
00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:09.781
LAURA: Sweet!

917
00:39:09.781 --> 00:39:11.197
MATT: Turns around, and you walk inside.

918
00:39:11.197 --> 00:39:14.350
The interior is small, it's ten-foot by ten-foot,

919
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.759
that is the extent of the interior.

920
00:39:17.759 --> 00:39:21.641
There's a heavy bundle of rags and furs and such

921
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:24.096
that are pushed over, a broken wooden frame

922
00:39:24.096 --> 00:39:26.063
that once maybe was a functional bed

923
00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:29.245
but now it's just a pile that it sleeps on.

924
00:39:29.245 --> 00:39:33.668
The smell in here is a combination of rotting food,

925
00:39:33.668 --> 00:39:37.201
general wet, oily fur,

926
00:39:37.201 --> 00:39:39.859
a hint of urine smell,

927
00:39:39.859 --> 00:39:42.973
and burned out candles.

928
00:39:42.973 --> 00:39:46.935
LAURA: The candles don't do a good job of covering that.

929
00:39:46.935 --> 00:39:49.079
MATT: "What?"

930
00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:53.421
LAURA: It's a little rank in your hut.

931
00:39:53.421 --> 00:39:54.989
MATT: "Well, you're welcome to leave."

932
00:39:54.989 --> 00:39:57.297
LAURA: No, no, no, I like it, it's wonderful.

933
00:39:57.297 --> 00:39:59.482
MATT: He pulls up a small stool

934
00:39:59.482 --> 00:40:03.819
and (groans) sits on it for a second.

935
00:40:03.819 --> 00:40:05.872
Leans on one knee towards you.

936
00:40:05.872 --> 00:40:09.555
"So why have you come to my house,

937
00:40:09.555 --> 00:40:11.900
what you want from me?"

938
00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.233
MARISHA: Are you going to tell us a story?

939
00:40:13.233 --> 00:40:15.129
You have the posture like you're

940
00:40:15.129 --> 00:40:16.529
going to tell us a ghost story.

941
00:40:16.529 --> 00:40:18.327
LAURA: Like, mostly I want to know like--

942
00:40:18.327 --> 00:40:20.535
MATT: (sniffing)

943
00:40:20.535 --> 00:40:22.877
"Where are you from, huh?

944
00:40:22.877 --> 00:40:25.868
"Not many humans hang around in Xhorhas."

945
00:40:25.868 --> 00:40:27.410
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, yeah.

946
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.957
You know, I feel like I'm a citizen of the world,

947
00:40:30.957 --> 00:40:33.747
you know, I'm not really from any one place.

948
00:40:33.747 --> 00:40:35.012
MATT: (muttering)

949
00:40:35.012 --> 00:40:37.181
LAURA: How did you meet the Traveler? When did you find him?

950
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:38.514
When did he come to you?

951
00:40:38.514 --> 00:40:41.024
MATT: "What's your name, friend?"

952
00:40:41.024 --> 00:40:43.101
LAURA: What's your name, friend?

953
00:40:43.101 --> 00:40:44.755
MATT: "I asked you first."

954
00:40:44.755 --> 00:40:46.267
LAURA: You did, you really did.

955
00:40:46.267 --> 00:40:48.775
It's Jester after all. What is yours?

956
00:40:48.775 --> 00:40:50.342
MATT: "Covak."

957
00:40:50.342 --> 00:40:51.569
LAURA: Korfak?

958
00:40:51.569 --> 00:40:52.402
MATT: (exaggerated) "Covak."

959
00:40:53.477 --> 00:40:55.052
LAURA: (exaggerated) Covak.

960
00:40:56.016 --> 00:40:57.667
Nice, yeah.

961
00:40:57.667 --> 00:40:59.830
When did you find him? When did he come to you?

962
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.206
What did he say, you know? What did he look like?

963
00:41:03.206 --> 00:41:05.648
Does he have the same cloak that he wears with me

964
00:41:05.648 --> 00:41:09.438
or is that like the only thing, or sometimes, you know?

965
00:41:09.438 --> 00:41:11.140
(laughter)

966
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.656
MATT: "Okay, well, he came and found me

967
00:41:14.656 --> 00:41:17.839
"about a couple of years ago,

968
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.693
"after my partner was killed by

969
00:41:20.693 --> 00:41:23.602
"a gloomstalker in the south.

970
00:41:23.602 --> 00:41:26.870
"Thought it strange that a fair folk would visit

971
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:30.256
"an old codger like myself, but he taught me

972
00:41:30.256 --> 00:41:34.495
"to pass the time, you know, pissing off folks with pranks."

973
00:41:34.495 --> 00:41:36.002
LAURA: Yeah.

974
00:41:36.002 --> 00:41:39.793
MATT: "You know, pissing off my neighbor, Bruuktash.

975
00:41:39.793 --> 00:41:41.389
"He's a real right prick."

976
00:41:41.389 --> 00:41:42.222
LAURA: Really?

977
00:41:42.222 --> 00:41:43.055
MATT: "Yeah.

978
00:41:43.055 --> 00:41:45.939
"Brought some liveliness back into my life

979
00:41:45.939 --> 00:41:50.039
"when I was mostly just lonely,

980
00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:52.593
"and promised he'd bring some gifts down the road

981
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:56.979
"the more I poked those nearby. (laughs)"

982
00:41:56.979 --> 00:41:58.074
LAURA: Did he?

983
00:41:58.074 --> 00:42:01.900
MATT: "Well, not yet, you know. I'm just sewing mischief

984
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.896
"as much as I can. The old--"

985
00:42:03.896 --> 00:42:04.830
LAURA: Right.

986
00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.316
MATT: "You know, physicality is breaking down

987
00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:09.053
"as the years pass on--"

988
00:42:09.053 --> 00:42:11.595
MATT: That's okay! You look spry, totally spry.

989
00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.611
You got really nice ears and I am

990
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:16.529
a good gnoll ear expert, after all.

991
00:42:16.529 --> 00:42:17.841
MATT: (laughs)

992
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:19.660
MARISHA: It's true.

993
00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.145
MATT: "(snorting) Well, anyway.

994
00:42:23.145 --> 00:42:26.278
"Kind of became me only friend.

995
00:42:27.303 --> 00:42:29.669
"Doesn't visit often, not really,

996
00:42:29.669 --> 00:42:32.424
"but he was telling me there was

00:42:32.424 --> 00:42:34.582
"supposed to be some meeting soon.

998
00:42:34.582 --> 00:42:36.228
LAURA: He was telling me about the same thing, yeah!

999
00:42:36.228 --> 00:42:39.228
MATT: "In Unndilar, some point around there.

1000
00:42:40.421 --> 00:42:42.234
"He told you the same?"

1001
00:42:42.234 --> 00:42:43.666
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, are you going to go?

1002
00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:46.941
I mean, I hear it's going to be the biggest rave ever.

1003
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:48.868
MATT: "Oh, (chuckles).

1004
00:42:48.868 --> 00:42:51.626
"I mean other than Gimmel who helps at the butcher

1005
00:42:51.626 --> 00:42:53.554
"you're the only other person I know

1006
00:42:53.554 --> 00:42:55.933
"who believes me. (nervous chuckle)"

1007
00:42:55.933 --> 00:42:56.905
LAURA: Wait, who?

1008
00:42:56.905 --> 00:42:58.813
MATT: "Gimmel at the butcher."

1009
00:42:58.813 --> 00:43:00.901
LAURA: Yeah, I can totally understand everything you say.

1010
00:43:00.901 --> 00:43:03.331
MATT: "I told him all about the Traveler.

1011
00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:04.595
"He made fun of me for a while, but--"

1012
00:43:04.595 --> 00:43:07.807
MARISHA: The dragonborn butcher, that guy?

1013
00:43:07.807 --> 00:43:11.113
LAURA: No, you're thinking of the Gentleman.

1014
00:43:11.113 --> 00:43:13.623
MATT: An ogre was the butcher.

1015
00:43:13.623 --> 00:43:14.847
LAURA: The ogre.
MATT: That you met.

1016
00:43:14.847 --> 00:43:15.680
MARISHA: Sorry.

1017
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.805
MATT: But you don't know who Gimmel is. You haven't run

1018
00:43:16.805 --> 00:43:17.828
into a Gimmel yet.

1019
00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:18.661
MARISHA: Gimmel.

1020
00:43:18.661 --> 00:43:22.186
MATT: "No, no, he's one of them orcish folks. (snorts)

1021
00:43:25.975 --> 00:43:28.491
"How'd you come to find him, huh?"

1022
00:43:28.491 --> 00:43:31.480
LAURA: Oh, came to see me when I was really young.

1023
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.288
MATT: "Oh, how long ago?"

1024
00:43:33.288 --> 00:43:38.038
LAURA: Oh, you know, years ago. Probably it must be like,

1025
00:43:39.607 --> 00:43:41.232
oh jeez.

1026
00:43:41.232 --> 00:43:42.328
MATT: "(coughs)"

1027
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:44.911
LAURA: 15 years ago maybe, you know?

1028
00:43:44.911 --> 00:43:46.661
MATT: "Ah. Long time!"

1029
00:43:46.661 --> 00:43:51.239
LAURA: He was, you know, like my age when he came to see me,

1030
00:43:51.239 --> 00:43:53.852
and then we hung out and we were like best friends

1031
00:43:53.852 --> 00:43:56.692
hanging out for a long time, and then, you know,

1032
00:43:56.692 --> 00:43:59.287
he got a little older, and I think like more powerful,

1033
00:43:59.287 --> 00:44:01.659
you know, because he tends to do these sort of things,

1034
00:44:01.659 --> 00:44:04.522
and then he seemed just to come see me less and less

1035
00:44:04.522 --> 00:44:07.033
but he still is, you know, super prevalent

1036
00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:09.458
in my life and stuff.

1037
00:44:09.458 --> 00:44:11.810
MATT: "That's great, I'm glad that he--"

1038
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.263
LAURA: I mean, I think I might be one of the originals.

1039
00:44:14.263 --> 00:44:18.035
I think if we go to this place in like a year, right,

1040
00:44:18.035 --> 00:44:20.844
I think that I'm probably going to be like, (clicks tongue)

1041
00:44:20.844 --> 00:44:22.466
pretty high up in the ranks.

1042
00:44:22.466 --> 00:44:24.148
MATT: "Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1043
00:44:24.148 --> 00:44:27.559
"I've done quite a few deeds in his name."

1044
00:44:27.559 --> 00:44:30.433
LAURA: I mean, do you have, like, a lot of spells from him?

1045
00:44:30.433 --> 00:44:32.758
Because I totally do.

1046
00:44:32.758 --> 00:44:34.083
MATT: "No, but I--"

1047
00:44:34.083 --> 00:44:36.279
LAURA: I brought a person back to life.

1048
00:44:37.961 --> 00:44:41.052
MATT: "I've shat in at least four of the wells

1049
00:44:41.052 --> 00:44:42.002
"of this city."

1050
00:44:42.002 --> 00:44:46.137
(laughter)

1051
00:44:46.137 --> 00:44:47.937
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1052
00:44:47.937 --> 00:44:50.257
LAURA: I smelled something when we went down there,

1053
00:44:50.257 --> 00:44:51.290
I think that might be--

1054
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:52.290
MARISHA: Yeah, it makes so much more sense.

1055
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.282
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

1056
00:44:53.282 --> 00:44:55.651
I was like, why does the water smell like this?

1057
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:58.279
MARISHA: I thought it was sewage, and it turns out it is.

1058
00:44:58.279 --> 00:44:59.332
(laughter)

1059
00:44:59.332 --> 00:45:01.897
MATT: "That's the will of the Traveler."

1060
00:45:01.897 --> 00:45:03.719
MARISHA: (laughs nervously)

1061
00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:04.930
MATT: "(coughing)"

1062
00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:07.730
MARISHA: Give everyone dysentery?

1063
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.008
LAURA: Oh, hold on, I have a present for you.

1064
00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:13.486
I'm going to take out my paintbrush of magic stuff

1065
00:45:13.486 --> 00:45:18.069
and I'm going to paint a little Traveler figurine for him.

1066
00:45:19.055 --> 00:45:20.530
MATT: "Oh.

1067
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.665
"You're quite talented, aren't you?"

1068
00:45:23.665 --> 00:45:25.013
LAURA: Yeah.

1069
00:45:25.013 --> 00:45:26.215
I'm really talented.

1070
00:45:26.215 --> 00:45:27.419
MATT: "Thank you."

1071
00:45:27.419 --> 00:45:28.976
LAURA: You're welcome. You can pray to that

1072
00:45:28.976 --> 00:45:31.014
whenever you feel the need to.

1073
00:45:31.014 --> 00:45:32.615
MATT: "(groans)"

1074
00:45:32.615 --> 00:45:34.516
Carefully gets up and lumbers across the chamber

1075
00:45:34.516 --> 00:45:37.628
and sets it on just this makeshift table

1076
00:45:37.628 --> 00:45:40.028
that's barely functional for a creature of his size,

1077
00:45:40.028 --> 00:45:42.687
and sits and admires it, his body half-cocked

1078
00:45:42.687 --> 00:45:45.313
to one side the way he holds his weight and goes,

1079
00:45:45.313 --> 00:45:48.611
"Yeah. (chuckles)"

1080
00:45:48.611 --> 00:45:49.444
LAURA: Yeah.

1081
00:45:49.444 --> 00:45:50.827
MATT: Spins around, looking at the both of you.

1082
00:45:50.827 --> 00:45:54.798
"How'd you come to know the Traveler, huh?"

1083
00:45:54.798 --> 00:45:58.249
MARISHA: Oh, you know, we're just starting our relationship.

1084
00:45:58.249 --> 00:46:02.002
It's still very new. It's really Jester here

1085
00:46:02.002 --> 00:46:06.168
that introduced me to him, and

1086
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.060
haven't been visited yet,

1087
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.725
personally, didn't know if he was real or not

1088
00:46:10.725 --> 00:46:13.938
until this just happened, so mind's a little bit blown,

1089
00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:16.105
but I'm hopeful, you know?

1090
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:23.500
MATT: "So, I'm really excited about this gathering,

1091
00:46:24.178 --> 00:46:28.266
"I don't get to meet a lot of other folks

1092
00:46:28.266 --> 00:46:31.484
"and most just think I'm a bit crazy, you know?"

1093
00:46:31.484 --> 00:46:32.991
LAURA: I didn't even know there were other people

1094
00:46:32.991 --> 00:46:34.496
and then we were in this one place

1095
00:46:34.496 --> 00:46:36.521
and I found these tokens that were, like,

1096
00:46:36.521 --> 00:46:38.271
his symbol, you know?

1097
00:46:38.271 --> 00:46:39.104
MATT: "Really?"

1098
00:46:39.104 --> 00:46:41.445
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, so somebody had to have left them there,

1099
00:46:41.445 --> 00:46:43.305
so there's got to be a few more of us.

1100
00:46:43.305 --> 00:46:46.421
MATT: "Oh, that's going to be such a good time.

1101
00:46:46.421 --> 00:46:47.279
"I'm excited."

1102
00:46:47.279 --> 00:46:48.673
LAURA: I have a feeling whoever brings

1103
00:46:48.673 --> 00:46:52.240
the most people to the thing is going to be the winner.

1104
00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.890
You should probably start--

1105
00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:54.773
MATT: "Oh, it's a contest?"

1106
00:46:54.773 --> 00:46:56.034
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1107
00:46:56.034 --> 00:46:57.631
MATT: "I didn't know about that.

1108
00:46:57.631 --> 00:46:59.658
"We're supposed to bring more?"

1109
00:46:59.658 --> 00:47:02.027
LAURA: You're supposed to bring as many people as you can.

1110
00:47:02.027 --> 00:47:04.060
MATT: "Well, there's only a few more months

1111
00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.892
"of time until, oh goodness--"

1112
00:47:05.892 --> 00:47:07.335
LAURA: Few more months?

1113
00:47:07.335 --> 00:47:09.438
Wait, what was that date?

1114
00:47:09.438 --> 00:47:10.627
I mean, I know, I remember.

1115
00:47:10.627 --> 00:47:15.572
MATT: "He just said Unndilar, more to come, so mysterious.

1116
00:47:15.572 --> 00:47:16.605
LAURA: I know.

1117
00:47:16.605 --> 00:47:19.496
MATT: "(chuckling)

1118
00:47:19.496 --> 00:47:20.893
"(coughing)"

1119
00:47:20.893 --> 00:47:22.946
LAURA: I hope you don't die before it happens

1120
00:47:22.946 --> 00:47:24.584
because that would really suck.

1121
00:47:24.584 --> 00:47:25.417
MATT: "Me, too.'

1122
00:47:25.417 --> 00:47:26.250
LAURA: Yeah.

1123
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.113
MATT: "(chuckles)"

1124
00:47:27.113 --> 00:47:28.581
LAURA: How long of a trek--
MARISHA: How old are you?

1125
00:47:28.581 --> 00:47:29.456
MARISHA: Sorry.

1126
00:47:29.456 --> 00:47:30.454
LAURA: Sorry.

1127
00:47:30.454 --> 00:47:32.118
MARISHA: What's old for a gnoll?

1128
00:47:32.118 --> 00:47:33.914
Is that rude to ask?

1129
00:47:33.914 --> 00:47:34.925
MATT: "Aye."

1130
00:47:36.783 --> 00:47:39.495
LAURA: How far away is this place?

1131
00:47:39.495 --> 00:47:40.916
MATT: "What place?"

1132
00:47:40.916 --> 00:47:42.137
LAURA: The place we're meeting him.

1133
00:47:42.137 --> 00:47:44.062
MATT: "I don't have a place yet.

1134
00:47:44.062 --> 00:47:46.712
"It's in the month of Unndilar."

1135
00:47:46.712 --> 00:47:48.539
LAURA: Oh, I thought he gave me a place.

1136
00:47:48.539 --> 00:47:50.199
MATT: "He didn't give me one yet."

1137
00:47:50.199 --> 00:47:52.877
LAURA: Oh, hold on, let me look at my notes.

1138
00:47:52.877 --> 00:47:54.893
LIAM: Can I interject for a second?

1139
00:47:54.893 --> 00:47:55.726
MATT: Sure.

1140
00:47:55.726 --> 00:47:56.987
LIAM: Caduceus, they've been gone for 10 minutes!

1141
00:47:56.987 --> 00:47:58.796
You see everything! Where did they go?

1142
00:47:58.796 --> 00:48:00.122
(laughter)

1143
00:48:00.122 --> 00:48:02.369
We can't make a store out here, but though they have been

1144
00:48:02.369 --> 00:48:04.166
gone forever. They've been taken or something.

1145
00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:05.623
SAM: Calm down, calm done, it's fine.

1146
00:48:05.623 --> 00:48:07.058
LIAM: It's not fine! Where are they?

1147
00:48:07.058 --> 00:48:09.438
MATT: "They haven't been taken. I just saw them

1148
00:48:09.438 --> 00:48:11.235
"go across the street that way."

1149
00:48:11.235 --> 00:48:13.531
TRAVIS: Is that a skid mark on the side of the well?

1150
00:48:13.531 --> 00:48:15.184
(laughter)

1151
00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:16.142
SAM: There is a bit of--

1152
00:48:16.142 --> 00:48:17.975
MATT: "I wasn't going to say anything about it,

1153
00:48:17.975 --> 00:48:19.691
"but probably."

1154
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:21.998
LAURA: I think I thought it was a location.

1155
00:48:21.998 --> 00:48:26.991
"The day Zenith, Unndilar" is what I wrote before.

1156
00:48:26.991 --> 00:48:30.296
MATT: "All right, I suppose the invitation's

1157
00:48:30.296 --> 00:48:35.224
"going to come at some point soon, right? (chuckles)"

1158
00:48:35.224 --> 00:48:36.974
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

1159
00:48:37.989 --> 00:48:40.196
I wonder if he can be in a bunch of different places

1160
00:48:40.196 --> 00:48:43.328
at the same time. Probably not.

1161
00:48:43.328 --> 00:48:47.072
I wonder what he wants us all to do when we get together.

1162
00:48:47.072 --> 00:48:49.465
MATT: "I'm sure it'll be interesting."

1163
00:48:49.465 --> 00:48:52.148
LAURA: Hey Traveler, are you here right now?

1164
00:48:52.148 --> 00:48:53.425
MATT: "Huh, huh?"

1165
00:48:53.425 --> 00:48:54.907
LAURA: What do you want us to do?

1166
00:48:54.907 --> 00:48:56.803
Will you tell us where we're going?

1167
00:48:56.803 --> 00:48:59.047
Because we're, you know, a couple people here now,

1168
00:48:59.047 --> 00:49:00.547
talking about you.

1169
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.554
Do you hear him?

1170
00:49:05.554 --> 00:49:08.001
MATT: "(laughs)

1171
00:49:08.001 --> 00:49:10.336
"Good trick, good trick.

1172
00:49:10.336 --> 00:49:13.032
"I almost thought he was here."

1173
00:49:13.032 --> 00:49:13.865
LAURA: He might be.

1174
00:49:13.865 --> 00:49:16.621
MATT: "It's been months since he made an appearance.

1175
00:49:16.621 --> 00:49:21.292
"I think that's his way of keeping me on my toes."

1176
00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:23.357
LAURA: I saw him last night.

1177
00:49:23.357 --> 00:49:24.924
MATT: "Okay."

1178
00:49:24.924 --> 00:49:26.510
(laughter)

1179
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:27.967
MATT: He visually deflates a bit.

1180
00:49:27.967 --> 00:49:30.524
(laughter)

1181
00:49:30.524 --> 00:49:32.551
MATT: It gets really awkward. The room just gets

1182
00:49:32.551 --> 00:49:34.043
super tense and quiet.

1183
00:49:34.043 --> 00:49:38.021
MARISHA: I back into a pot and knock it over a little.

1184
00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:40.072
LAURA: Oh no, that was probably the pee pot.

1185
00:49:40.072 --> 00:49:40.906
MATT: It was.

1186
00:49:40.906 --> 00:49:42.723
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

1187
00:49:42.723 --> 00:49:45.475
(groans)

1188
00:49:45.475 --> 00:49:47.334
MARISHA: Feeling uncomfortable.

1189
00:49:47.334 --> 00:49:48.607
LAURA: Hey, so--

1190
00:49:48.607 --> 00:49:51.127
MATT: "You should probably get going."

1191
00:49:51.127 --> 00:49:55.788
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Hey, do you know the spell Sending?

1192
00:49:55.788 --> 00:49:57.090
MATT: "What?"

1193
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.898
LAURA: So, it's this spell where you can

1194
00:49:59.898 --> 00:50:01.504
send people messages.

1195
00:50:01.504 --> 00:50:03.321
MATT: "I don't."

1196
00:50:03.321 --> 00:50:07.030
LAURA: Okay, well I know it, so here's the deal.

1197
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:10.301
If I find out a location, I'm going to

1198
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:12.182
Send you and let you know.

1199
00:50:12.182 --> 00:50:15.092
MATT: "Sure, no, tell me more about the great gifts

1200
00:50:15.092 --> 00:50:17.511
"he's given you. It's fantastic."

1201
00:50:17.511 --> 00:50:20.220
LAURA: Well, I mean, I've known him for a long time.

1202
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.832
Like I'm sure in a couple years, you'll,

1203
00:50:22.832 --> 00:50:26.233
and maybe when we meet in a couple months, you know,

1204
00:50:26.233 --> 00:50:28.310
you'll already have some spells.

1205
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.674
Maybe if you started wearing a cloak like him,

1206
00:50:30.674 --> 00:50:32.688
you know, he would like it.

1207
00:50:32.688 --> 00:50:34.357
I draw dicks on things.

1208
00:50:34.357 --> 00:50:36.495
MATT: Reaches back and grabs one of the blankets

1209
00:50:36.495 --> 00:50:39.122
from the bed and (whooshing).

1210
00:50:39.122 --> 00:50:41.734
LAURA: That is already a huge improvement.

1211
00:50:41.734 --> 00:50:45.039
MATT: "All right, yeah. (chuckles)"

1212
00:50:45.039 --> 00:50:46.530
TRAVIS: When an NPC tells you to leave.

1213
00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:49.273
MATT: You can now see the gnoll is like eyeing you

1214
00:50:49.273 --> 00:50:51.234
up and down very intently and is making,

1215
00:50:51.234 --> 00:50:52.581
with the good eye on the left,

1216
00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:54.886
and is making intense mental notes.

1217
00:50:54.886 --> 00:50:58.148
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, take it in, take it all in.

1218
00:50:58.148 --> 00:50:59.831
All right Beau, we should go.

1219
00:50:59.831 --> 00:51:00.664
MARISHA: Yeah.

1220
00:51:02.231 --> 00:51:03.648
MATT: "I'll escort you."

1221
00:51:05.085 --> 00:51:06.491
MARISHA: Nice to meet you.

1222
00:51:06.491 --> 00:51:08.355
MATT: You see the hands touch the back,

1223
00:51:08.355 --> 00:51:10.129
and for as old as this gnoll is,

1224
00:51:10.129 --> 00:51:12.017
still got some strength in him,

1225
00:51:12.017 --> 00:51:14.671
and shoves you back out the side.

1226
00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:16.697
The front door.

1227
00:51:16.697 --> 00:51:18.599
The door (creaks).

1228
00:51:18.599 --> 00:51:21.879
"See you in a few months, dear.

1229
00:51:21.879 --> 00:51:23.026
"(snorts)"

1230
00:51:23.026 --> 00:51:24.262
SAM: Oh.

1231
00:51:24.262 --> 00:51:27.226
MARISHA: Why's everyone react to me like that?

1232
00:51:27.226 --> 00:51:28.111
LAURA: I don't know.

1233
00:51:28.111 --> 00:51:29.205
You're so likable.

1234
00:51:29.205 --> 00:51:30.474
MATT: At this point, you do notice that

1235
00:51:30.474 --> 00:51:33.039
Jester's cloak is on fire.

1236
00:51:33.039 --> 00:51:34.740
(nervous exclaiming)

1237
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.672
LAURA: What?

1238
00:51:35.672 --> 00:51:36.656
(laughter)

1239
00:51:36.656 --> 00:51:37.805
MATT: You pat it out.

1240
00:51:37.805 --> 00:51:40.321
You hear behind the door, "(laughs)."

1241
00:51:40.321 --> 00:51:42.013
LAURA: (laughs)

1242
00:51:42.013 --> 00:51:44.133
MARISHA: What is wrong with you people?

1243
00:51:44.133 --> 00:51:46.872
TRAVIS: Jesus, it's Fight Club.

1244
00:51:46.872 --> 00:51:49.253
LAURA: I'm going to go to the back of his hut

1245
00:51:49.253 --> 00:51:54.232
and just draw a giant dick

1246
00:51:54.232 --> 00:51:56.175
and a flaming poo.

1247
00:51:56.175 --> 00:51:57.590
MATT: All righty.

1248
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:01.441
MARISHA: I get the boys' attention, and Nott.

1249
00:52:01.441 --> 00:52:03.607
MATT: "Oh, there she is."

1250
00:52:04.825 --> 00:52:07.222
LIAM: You should've led with that, Caduceus.

1251
00:52:07.222 --> 00:52:08.363
SAM: Hi.

1252
00:52:08.363 --> 00:52:09.997
Everything all right out here?

1253
00:52:09.997 --> 00:52:11.222
MARISHA: How do I smell?

1254
00:52:11.222 --> 00:52:13.497
LAURA: You smell like pee!

1255
00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:14.748
TRAVIS: Y'all smell like wet dog.

1256
00:52:14.748 --> 00:52:15.787
MARISHA: (groans)

1257
00:52:15.787 --> 00:52:16.678
SAM: I like it.

1258
00:52:16.678 --> 00:52:18.916
MARISHA: I have so many questions.

1259
00:52:18.916 --> 00:52:21.349
LAURA: There was a dude and he also worshiped

1260
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:22.750
the Traveler, you guys.

1261
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.547
SAM: Is that unusual?

1262
00:52:24.547 --> 00:52:25.732
Is that--

1263
00:52:25.732 --> 00:52:27.691
LAURA: I've never met somebody else that did.

1264
00:52:27.691 --> 00:52:28.655
SAM: Wow.

1265
00:52:28.655 --> 00:52:32.094
LAURA: But the better news is that I'm way more powerful

1266
00:52:32.094 --> 00:52:36.140
than he is, that means the Traveler likes me so much more!

1267
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:36.973
SAM: That is good news.

1268
00:52:36.973 --> 00:52:38.938
LAURA: So not only are you not alone,

1269
00:52:38.938 --> 00:52:41.855
you're the only one that can do stuff?

1270
00:52:41.855 --> 00:52:43.350
LAURA: I don't know if I'm the only one,

1271
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:46.729
but obviously I'm one step above that dude, so.

1272
00:52:46.729 --> 00:52:48.052
SAM: Nice.

1273
00:52:48.052 --> 00:52:49.204
Nicely done.

1274
00:52:49.204 --> 00:52:50.887
MARISHA: He was a very old gnoll,

1275
00:52:50.887 --> 00:52:52.528
like steps away from death,

1276
00:52:53.386 --> 00:52:56.689
you know, like so old, yeah.

1277
00:52:56.689 --> 00:52:57.757
TRAVIS: Could smell it on him?

1278
00:52:57.757 --> 00:52:59.255
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

1279
00:52:59.255 --> 00:53:00.705
SAM: That's got to be a good sign

1280
00:53:00.705 --> 00:53:01.930
that we're on the right path.

1281
00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:04.114
LAURA: Yeah, so P.S., in a few months

1282
00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:06.572
I'm going to have to go and, you know,

1283
00:53:06.572 --> 00:53:10.704
get together with all the other Traveler followers.

1284
00:53:10.704 --> 00:53:11.706
MARISHA: Yeah, so--

1285
00:53:11.706 --> 00:53:12.914
TRAVIS: In a couple months?

1286
00:53:12.914 --> 00:53:14.369
LAURA: I don't know where it's at, though,

1287
00:53:14.369 --> 00:53:17.181
so hopefully it's somewhere we can get to pretty soon.

1288
00:53:17.181 --> 00:53:20.264
TRAVIS: How many other followers are there?

1289
00:53:21.723 --> 00:53:22.640
Like, five?

1290
00:53:24.297 --> 00:53:25.680
LAURA: (noncommittal noise)

1291
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.652
SAM: Should probably find out at this event, right?

1292
00:53:27.652 --> 00:53:28.485
LAURA: Yeah.

1293
00:53:28.485 --> 00:53:30.768
MARISHA: I mean, has he given you any indication

1294
00:53:30.768 --> 00:53:32.942
of what he wants with all of you there?

1295
00:53:32.942 --> 00:53:34.074
LIAM: The Traveler does not give you

1296
00:53:34.074 --> 00:53:36.015
any answers to these questions?

1297
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:38.799
LAURA: No.

1298
00:53:38.799 --> 00:53:40.985
SAM: Well, most religion is steeped in mystery

1299
00:53:40.985 --> 00:53:42.767
by design, actually.

1300
00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:43.925
LAURA: You know what, I'm going to talk

1301
00:53:43.925 --> 00:53:44.891
to him about it tonight.

1302
00:53:44.891 --> 00:53:45.777
MARISHA: Okay.

1303
00:53:45.777 --> 00:53:47.792
Just make sure it's not some like weird cult thing

1304
00:53:47.792 --> 00:53:49.734
they want you to do a mass suicide

1305
00:53:49.734 --> 00:53:51.811
and ride on a comet or something.

1306
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:52.743
TRAVIS: That'd be dark, yeah.

1307
00:53:52.743 --> 00:53:54.009
LAURA: What would be the point of that?

1308
00:53:54.009 --> 00:53:54.842
MARISHA: I don't know!

1309
00:53:54.842 --> 00:53:56.873
LAURA: If we all die, how would he get his name out?

1310
00:53:56.873 --> 00:53:58.519
MARISHA: That's a good point, but I don't know

1311
00:53:58.519 --> 00:54:00.139
what his power is fueled by.

1312
00:54:00.139 --> 00:54:01.535
TRAVIS: Yeah, his ways could be mysterious,

1313
00:54:01.535 --> 00:54:03.529
beyond your comprehension.

1314
00:54:03.529 --> 00:54:06.522
MATT: "Gods are pretty mysterious."

1315
00:54:06.522 --> 00:54:09.032
LAURA: But your god is really pretty.

1316
00:54:09.032 --> 00:54:10.895
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, she's pretty nice."

1317
00:54:10.895 --> 00:54:12.795
LAURA: Yeah.

1318
00:54:12.795 --> 00:54:14.932
LIAM: Well, I'm sure Nott's husband is sitting pretty.

1319
00:54:14.932 --> 00:54:16.323
What are we doing right now?

1320
00:54:16.323 --> 00:54:18.092
SAM: We have to go rescue him!

1321
00:54:18.092 --> 00:54:20.828
Oh my god, he's probably dying right now.

1322
00:54:20.828 --> 00:54:22.736
TRAVIS: What if that minotaur comes around?

1323
00:54:22.736 --> 00:54:23.881
SAM: (gasps) Did you see him?

1324
00:54:23.881 --> 00:54:25.893
(laughter)

1325
00:54:25.893 --> 00:54:28.293
LIAM: Let's decide on a course of action.

1326
00:54:28.293 --> 00:54:30.006
Right now I would like to get out of this city,

1327
00:54:30.006 --> 00:54:30.956
actually, so--

1328
00:54:30.956 --> 00:54:32.046
LAURA: We go see Lady Olios.

1329
00:54:32.046 --> 00:54:34.262
SAM: We have to go see Lady Olios, present our--

1330
00:54:34.262 --> 00:54:35.294
LAURA: Our findings.

1331
00:54:35.294 --> 00:54:37.152
SAM: Our findings and our evidence,

1332
00:54:37.152 --> 00:54:40.901
and for the payment, we should probably decide

1333
00:54:40.901 --> 00:54:43.168
before we get there, so maybe as we walk

1334
00:54:43.168 --> 00:54:44.126
we can talk about this.

1335
00:54:44.126 --> 00:54:45.328
TRAVIS: We're walking and talking now.

1336
00:54:45.328 --> 00:54:46.617
SAM: We're walking and talking.

1337
00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:50.284
The favor that we ask of Lady Olios could be

1338
00:54:51.951 --> 00:54:54.331
transportation to Ghor Dranas,

1339
00:54:54.331 --> 00:54:58.831
the release of my husband, the location of my husband,

1340
00:55:00.128 --> 00:55:03.172
permission to see, visit my husband.

1341
00:55:03.172 --> 00:55:04.832
I don't know what's too much, right?

1342
00:55:04.832 --> 00:55:07.294
If we ask for her to release my husband,

1343
00:55:07.294 --> 00:55:09.029
maybe she doesn't have that ability,

1344
00:55:09.029 --> 00:55:10.687
maybe we've just wasted our wish.

1345
00:55:10.687 --> 00:55:12.566
TRAVIS: When it comes to your husband, do you think

1346
00:55:12.566 --> 00:55:15.280
it's important to not detail him as your husband?

1347
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.178
MARISHA: Yeah, we didn't tell her that we're

1348
00:55:17.178 --> 00:55:19.986
from the Empire, and--
LAURA: Shut up, Beau!

1349
00:55:19.986 --> 00:55:21.261
LAURA: Stop saying that out loud!

1350
00:55:21.261 --> 00:55:22.461
MARISHA: I'm saying it quietly.

1351
00:55:23.542 --> 00:55:25.358
Quietly!

1352
00:55:25.358 --> 00:55:27.141
MATT: I assume these conversations are quiet.

1353
00:55:27.141 --> 00:55:28.555
TRAVIS: Sotto voce.

1354
00:55:28.555 --> 00:55:30.143
(laughter)

1355
00:55:30.143 --> 00:55:33.968
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, was he known as a chemist,

1356
00:55:33.968 --> 00:55:35.026
like a scientist?

1357
00:55:35.026 --> 00:55:39.044
Could we ask to see a scientist that was in--

1358
00:55:39.044 --> 00:55:41.062
SAM: We have to specify that it's him.

1359
00:55:41.062 --> 00:55:43.079
I don't want to see just any scientist, right?

1360
00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:46.013
I don't have to reveal my relationship.

1361
00:55:46.013 --> 00:55:48.202
It could just be an important person to us.

1362
00:55:48.202 --> 00:55:52.111
Maybe, who are we, right?

1363
00:55:52.111 --> 00:55:54.636
That's maybe the first thing we need to establish

1364
00:55:54.636 --> 00:55:57.565
when she says who are you guys, who did we tell her we were?

1365
00:55:57.565 --> 00:55:59.373
SAM: We're a band of--
LAURA: Mercenaries?

1366
00:55:59.373 --> 00:56:00.606
SAM: Travelers?

1367
00:56:00.606 --> 00:56:01.447
LAURA: I don't remember.

1368
00:56:01.447 --> 00:56:02.790
SAM: I think we said people--

1369
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.139
LAURA: We said we were investigators.

1370
00:56:04.139 --> 00:56:05.933
SAM: We were trying to find this man.

1371
00:56:05.933 --> 00:56:08.836
TRAVIS: What if we were commissioned to build a piece

1372
00:56:08.836 --> 00:56:13.075
of a scientific apparatus that he needed for his studies,

1373
00:56:13.075 --> 00:56:15.558
and the only way to get him what he needs

1374
00:56:15.558 --> 00:56:17.941
is to be reunited with him.

1375
00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:20.065
SAM: Could be, we already did tell her

1376
00:56:20.065 --> 00:56:22.146
that we were being hired to go find him and bring him back.

1377
00:56:22.146 --> 00:56:23.363
TRAVIS: Well, shit, fuck.

1378
00:56:23.363 --> 00:56:25.168
SAM: We didn't say why or by whom.

1379
00:56:25.168 --> 00:56:27.191
We could say for the good of science

1380
00:56:27.191 --> 00:56:29.545
he's needed back in wherever he's from.

1381
00:56:29.545 --> 00:56:30.420
TRAVIS: Because if we can just get in

1382
00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.386
the same room with him,

1383
00:56:31.386 --> 00:56:34.520
then we could (whooshes) out of there somehow, right?

1384
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.464
SAM: Some of us can.

1385
00:56:36.464 --> 00:56:38.302
TRAVIS: I mean, that's what we should probably be

1386
00:56:38.302 --> 00:56:40.900
hoping to do, at a best case scenario.

1387
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.801
LAURA: Caleb, how long until you can use that thingy?

1388
00:56:42.801 --> 00:56:44.077
LIAM: Which thingy?

1389
00:56:44.077 --> 00:56:46.098
LAURA: The teleportation thingy?

1390
00:56:46.098 --> 00:56:48.408
LIAM: I need to study.

1391
00:56:48.408 --> 00:56:50.533
We are getting killed almost every day.

1392
00:56:50.533 --> 00:56:52.460
(laughter)

1393
00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.580
LAURA: How long does it take to study?

1394
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.239
LIAM: Years.

1395
00:56:56.239 --> 00:56:59.127
LAURA: It's going to be years before we can do that?

1396
00:56:59.127 --> 00:57:01.446
LIAM: I don't know, I need access to books and libraries

1397
00:57:01.446 --> 00:57:04.929
and paper and ink and not being murdered by things.

1398
00:57:04.929 --> 00:57:06.009
LAURA: That's why you always look for books?

1399
00:57:06.009 --> 00:57:08.912
SAM: Yes, he's trying to find new powers and abilities.

1400
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:13.218
LAURA: But he already told you how to do it, didn't he?

1401
00:57:13.218 --> 00:57:14.133
LIAM: No.

1402
00:57:14.133 --> 00:57:17.185
LAURA: He just said hey, here's a thing?

1403
00:57:17.185 --> 00:57:21.250
LIAM: He gave me a back door, and told me when I--

1404
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.630
LAURA: Is that like a--

1405
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:24.471
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: You are so--

1406
00:57:24.471 --> 00:57:26.604
LAURA: I'm just confused, what are you--

1407
00:57:26.604 --> 00:57:28.341
TRAVIS: Just chill out, all right?

1408
00:57:28.341 --> 00:57:29.526
MARISHA: (laughs)

1409
00:57:29.526 --> 00:57:31.545
TRAVIS: So we're looking for him, and maybe we need

1410
00:57:31.545 --> 00:57:33.619
to give him something to complete his studies,

1411
00:57:33.619 --> 00:57:35.848
that way they're motivated to get us near him, right?

1412
00:57:35.848 --> 00:57:37.319
I mean, that's what they took him for,

1413
00:57:37.319 --> 00:57:41.015
because he was studying their stuff.

1414
00:57:41.015 --> 00:57:42.221
SAM: Maybe.

1415
00:57:42.221 --> 00:57:44.904
LAURA: What if we just, with her, what if we just say

1416
00:57:44.904 --> 00:57:47.335
hey, will you give us a letter, a sealed document,

1417
00:57:47.335 --> 00:57:49.736
saying give them whatever they ask for.

1418
00:57:49.736 --> 00:57:51.275
SAM: Give who whatever who asks for?

1419
00:57:51.275 --> 00:57:52.108
LAURA: Us.

1420
00:57:52.108 --> 00:57:53.515
SAM: To give to whom?

1421
00:57:53.515 --> 00:57:54.461
TRAVIS: From Lady Olios?

1422
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:56.752
LAURA: Yeah, a signed document from Lady Olios

1423
00:57:56.752 --> 00:57:59.199
to whoever is in charge in Ghor Dranas

1424
00:57:59.199 --> 00:58:01.520
and say hey, these people did a huge favor for me,

1425
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.896
give them whatever they want.

1426
00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:05.007
SAM: I'm sure she'll have questions, followup

1427
00:58:05.007 --> 00:58:09.744
questions, right? I mean, she's not dumb, I assume.

1428
00:58:09.744 --> 00:58:11.348
MARISHA: Well look, we already told her that we're

1429
00:58:11.348 --> 00:58:13.600
looking for somebody. That's not that far-fetched.

1430
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.261
SAM: I think what we need to decide is

1431
00:58:15.261 --> 00:58:16.947
are we looking for his location

1432
00:58:16.947 --> 00:58:20.430
or are we looking for him to be released to us?

1433
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.140
Is that a bridge too far, should we start with that?

1434
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:27.529
LIAM: They sent forces into another empire to retrieve him.

1435
00:58:27.529 --> 00:58:31.268
She's not just going to throw all caution to the wind

1436
00:58:31.268 --> 00:58:32.954
and give us everything we want.

1437
00:58:32.954 --> 00:58:34.562
LIAM: We find out where he is.
SAM: Just his location.

1438
00:58:34.562 --> 00:58:36.172
LAURA: So then we need access to question him.

1439
00:58:36.172 --> 00:58:37.005
TRAVIS: Yeah, an audience.

1440
00:58:37.005 --> 00:58:38.768
SAM: Oh, yes, ooh, that's a good idea.

1441
00:58:38.768 --> 00:58:40.492
We have our own beef with him.

1442
00:58:40.492 --> 00:58:41.676
LAURA: Yeah, fuck that guy.

1443
00:58:41.676 --> 00:58:43.228
SAM: We need to get our own answers

1444
00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:44.822
to close our investigation.

1445
00:58:44.822 --> 00:58:45.655
LARUA: Yes, yes, yes.

1446
00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:47.596
SAM: Ooh, I don't mind this idea.

1447
00:58:47.596 --> 00:58:49.207
TRAVIS: Right, what did he do?

1448
00:58:49.207 --> 00:58:50.288
SAM: He knows what he did.

1449
00:58:50.288 --> 00:58:52.896
TRAVIS: Yeah, but (high-pitched voice) I'm Lady Olios.

1450
00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:54.012
What did he do?

1451
00:58:54.012 --> 00:58:56.185
SAM: Hmm, what do you think he did?

1452
00:58:56.185 --> 00:58:57.549
LAURA: He's a very powerful alchemist.

1453
00:58:57.549 --> 00:58:58.382
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Quickly, I'm very

1454
00:58:58.382 --> 00:58:59.257
highly regarded.

1455
00:58:59.257 --> 00:59:01.113
LAURA: Apparently, one of his potions that he made

1456
00:59:01.113 --> 00:59:03.070
killed an important family member,

1457
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:04.849
and we were hired by that family.

1458
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:06.646
SAM: Wow, this is good.

1459
00:59:06.646 --> 00:59:09.601
LAURA: Or it made them, okay, it made them really sick.

1460
00:59:09.601 --> 00:59:10.477
SAM: Uh-huh.

1461
00:59:10.477 --> 00:59:12.187
LAURA: So we have to go question him

1462
00:59:12.187 --> 00:59:14.082
because we have to find the antidote.

1463
00:59:14.082 --> 00:59:15.243
SAM: The antidote, the cure!

1464
00:59:15.243 --> 00:59:17.465
LAURA: We're on a time limit!

1465
00:59:17.465 --> 00:59:19.252
SAM: This is good. That feels like,

1466
00:59:19.252 --> 00:59:20.830
I mean, that's not just a good cover story,

1467
00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.566
that's just a good story period.

1468
00:59:22.566 --> 00:59:23.922
I want to find out what happens.

1469
00:59:23.922 --> 00:59:25.744
How does it end?

1470
00:59:25.744 --> 00:59:27.918
MARISHA: It is the story, though, more or less.

1471
00:59:27.918 --> 00:59:29.012
SAM: Oh yes.

1472
00:59:29.012 --> 00:59:30.603
MARISHA: People have been getting really sick

1473
00:59:30.603 --> 00:59:32.385
in various parts of the world.

1474
00:59:32.385 --> 00:59:33.633
SAM: That's true.

1475
00:59:33.633 --> 00:59:36.315
MARISHA: Whenever you're lying to somebody--

1476
00:59:36.315 --> 00:59:38.175
look, I've been doing this a lot.

1477
00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:39.565
Whenever you lie to somebody--

1478
00:59:39.565 --> 00:59:40.742
SAM: Caduceus has rubbed off on you, I think.

1479
00:59:40.742 --> 00:59:42.576
MARISHA: You got to keep it close to the truth.

1480
00:59:42.576 --> 00:59:45.452
You got to keep it rooted in things that are true,

1481
00:59:45.452 --> 00:59:47.881
and then you just, you know, you play with those--

1482
00:59:47.881 --> 00:59:49.231
MATT: "Just tell the truth."

1483
00:59:49.231 --> 00:59:50.459
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1484
00:59:50.459 --> 00:59:52.023
MARSIAH: Those boundaries a little bit.

1485
00:59:52.023 --> 00:59:55.515
LAURA: What's wrong, Caleb? Why do you look like this?

1486
00:59:55.515 --> 00:59:59.041
LIAM: It's just been a hard day, and this sounds

1487
00:59:59.041 --> 01:00:00.791
like a very bad idea.

1488
01:00:01.674 --> 01:00:03.563
LAURA: What are you talking about? It's a really good idea.

1489
01:00:03.563 --> 01:00:05.407
We've got the Traveler on our side, you know?

1490
01:00:05.407 --> 01:00:06.682
LIAM: We are walking into the heart of

1491
01:00:06.682 --> 01:00:08.881
the enemy of the Empire.

1492
01:00:08.881 --> 01:00:11.230
MARISHA: Well, we've already done it once.

1493
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:12.689
We're just walking in again.

1494
01:00:12.689 --> 01:00:14.146
SAM: She owes us now, though.

1495
01:00:14.146 --> 01:00:15.362
She can't have us killed.

1496
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.744
TRAVIS: How about we ask for that, and worst case scenario,

1497
01:00:16.744 --> 01:00:18.120
we get the location, yeah?

1498
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.978
MARISHA: Yeah, negotiation tactics.

1499
01:00:19.978 --> 01:00:21.110
You start high--

1500
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:23.412
LIAM: She's not going to give us everything.

1501
01:00:23.412 --> 01:00:24.769
MARISHA: Huh?

1502
01:00:24.769 --> 01:00:26.685
SAM: Maybe she'll give us something.

1503
01:00:26.685 --> 01:00:28.657
LIAM: Yeah, maybe something.

1504
01:00:28.657 --> 01:00:32.676
MARISHA: You know what my mom used to always tell me?

1505
01:00:32.676 --> 01:00:34.295
TRAVIS: No.

1506
01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:37.549
MARISHA: If you ask, the worst they can do is say no,

1507
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:40.133
and throw you in an imperial prison,

1508
01:00:40.133 --> 01:00:42.167
and you'll never see your family again.

1509
01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:43.000
LAURA: (laughs)

1510
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.194
MARISHA: That's the worst that could happen.

1511
01:00:44.194 --> 01:00:45.850
LIAM: <i>That</i> is the worst they can do.

1512
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.769
SAM: That's happened to at least three of us.

1513
01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.980
LIAM: That's not even the worst they can do.

1514
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.707
LAURA: I think if she doesn't want to give us

1515
01:00:51.707 --> 01:00:54.634
the favor that we want, we just take the money,

1516
01:00:54.634 --> 01:00:57.844
and then we say thank you, and then we leave.

1517
01:00:57.844 --> 01:00:59.674
SAM: Is the money Plan B?

1518
01:00:59.674 --> 01:01:01.251
If she doesn't want to give us the location,

1519
01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:03.721
maybe she can give us safe passage to Ghor Dranas.

1520
01:01:03.721 --> 01:01:05.909
Is that worth it, or is the money better?

1521
01:01:05.909 --> 01:01:09.227
MARISHA: I'm real broke. I'm super into the idea of money.

1522
01:01:09.227 --> 01:01:10.060
SAM: Okay.

1523
01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:10.893
MARISHA: But--

1524
01:01:10.893 --> 01:01:11.969
LAURA: Because we already have transportation.

1525
01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:13.451
We have our moor--

1526
01:01:13.451 --> 01:01:15.803
TRAVIS: Time to see how we fare. You ready?

1527
01:01:15.803 --> 01:01:17.043
MARISHA: All right, access first, right?

1528
01:01:17.043 --> 01:01:18.309
Access first.

1529
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:19.151
SAM: Access.

1530
01:01:19.151 --> 01:01:20.822
MARISHA: Who's going to do all the talking?

1531
01:01:20.822 --> 01:01:24.028
LAURA: We will, because we already established the fact

1532
01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:25.089
that we are doing it.

1533
01:01:25.089 --> 01:01:26.927
SAM: If someone wants to come with us, I wouldn't mind it.

1534
01:01:26.927 --> 01:01:29.408
LIAM: Maybe Fjord should go with you this time.

1535
01:01:29.408 --> 01:01:30.864
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind.

1536
01:01:30.864 --> 01:01:32.550
SAM: All right.

1537
01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:34.297
LAURA: All right.

1538
01:01:34.297 --> 01:01:35.188
SAM: Let's do this.

1539
01:01:35.188 --> 01:01:36.021
LAURA: Okay.

1540
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:39.384
MARISHA: I'll be nearby, watching the tower, keeping watch.

1541
01:01:39.384 --> 01:01:41.285
SAM: Keep sentry, keep near him and if there's

1542
01:01:41.285 --> 01:01:43.633
anything spooky outside, you can message me,

1543
01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:46.861
and if we get problems inside, we'll message you.

1544
01:01:46.861 --> 01:01:48.910
MARISHA: I'm going to try and be inconspicuous,

1545
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:50.910
because I reek of Empire.

1546
01:01:52.326 --> 01:01:53.824
LAURA: You reek of pee, actually.

1547
01:01:53.824 --> 01:01:55.087
MARISHA: Yeah, I do, ugh.

1548
01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:56.245
SAM: That's probably good around here.

1549
01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.864
So the humans and Yasha will stay outside,

1550
01:01:58.864 --> 01:02:00.322
with the firbolg.

1551
01:02:00.322 --> 01:02:02.716
LIAM: We should change ourselves again.

1552
01:02:02.716 --> 01:02:05.038
I am going to use Disguise Self

1553
01:02:05.038 --> 01:02:07.171
and turn myself into a half-orc.

1554
01:02:07.171 --> 01:02:08.291
MARISHA: Can you do that to me?

1555
01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.978
LIAM: I can do something similar, yeah.

1556
01:02:09.978 --> 01:02:10.866
I've already done it once.

1557
01:02:10.866 --> 01:02:12.106
LAURA: Are you going to just do that while we're walking

1558
01:02:12.106 --> 01:02:14.800
or are you going to duck into a alley or something?

1559
01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.869
LIAM: That part is implied, Jester.

1560
01:02:16.869 --> 01:02:18.401
SAM: (laughs)

1561
01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.560
LIAM: What do you want to be, Beauregard?

1562
01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.221
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1563
01:02:22.221 --> 01:02:26.028
MARISHA: I'll be my sexy tiefling boy again.

1564
01:02:26.028 --> 01:02:27.337
LIAM: Special it is.

1565
01:02:27.337 --> 01:02:29.710
Okay, let's go find a quiet place.

1566
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:30.993
MATT: All right, so you're using your

1567
01:02:30.993 --> 01:02:32.093
Polymorph again for that?

1568
01:02:32.093 --> 01:02:33.965
LIAM: Yeah, Disguise Self on myself--

1569
01:02:33.965 --> 01:02:35.270
MATT: And then Polymorph.

1570
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:39.371
Which as you are a transmutation specialist,

1571
01:02:39.371 --> 01:02:41.151
to burn a fourth level spell for essentially

1572
01:02:41.151 --> 01:02:43.595
a first level ability that is concentration, I'll allow it.

1573
01:02:43.595 --> 01:02:46.330
LIAM: <i>Danke schön, mein herr.</i>

1574
01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:49.296
MATT: All right, so, as you guys go and disguise yourselves

1575
01:02:49.296 --> 01:02:51.236
and Caduceus just waits and--

1576
01:02:51.236 --> 01:02:54.895
MARISHA: I hand off the rubbings of the sigils.

1577
01:02:54.895 --> 01:02:56.580
SAM: Oh, and we'll take the--

1578
01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:57.810
MARISHA: The disk, yeah.

1579
01:02:57.810 --> 01:02:59.267
SAM: The disk and the scroll, yes.

1580
01:02:59.267 --> 01:03:02.217
TRAVIS: Anybody want to stare into the dingle-danger?

1581
01:03:02.217 --> 01:03:03.050
SAM: Yes.

1582
01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:04.506
LAURA: Oh. Who should do it?

1583
01:03:04.506 --> 01:03:05.964
MATT: Dingle-banger?

1584
01:03:05.964 --> 01:03:08.052
LAURA: Who wants to stare into this?

1585
01:03:08.052 --> 01:03:09.117
SAM: I'll stare into it.

1586
01:03:09.117 --> 01:03:10.606
LAURA: Yeah, but make sure you don't take it out.

1587
01:03:10.606 --> 01:03:12.684
Here is the gold disk.

1588
01:03:12.684 --> 01:03:15.851
SAM: Ooh, so many threads of possibility.

1589
01:03:17.218 --> 01:03:18.445
MATT: So Nott's looking into it?

1590
01:03:18.445 --> 01:03:19.669
SAM: Yep.
MATT: All righty.

1591
01:03:19.669 --> 01:03:21.861
TRAVIS: That was just a handful of glitter.

1592
01:03:21.861 --> 01:03:24.647
(laughter)

1593
01:03:24.647 --> 01:03:25.480
MATT: All right.

1594
01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.782
LAURA: That'll never come off.

1595
01:03:26.782 --> 01:03:29.597
MATT: You make your way to the central portion of Asarius

1596
01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:33.647
to the large standing gray tower

1597
01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:36.299
that is the Aurora Hold.

1598
01:03:36.299 --> 01:03:39.837
Through the familiar doorway, you are led by the clerk

1599
01:03:39.837 --> 01:03:44.824
back to the chamber where Lady Zethriss Olios makes

1600
01:03:44.824 --> 01:03:48.122
her time, it seems, since the previous conversation you had.

1601
01:03:48.122 --> 01:03:50.202
Led into that same study-like chamber,

1602
01:03:50.202 --> 01:03:54.887
she sits in mid-conversation with another drow figure

1603
01:03:54.887 --> 01:03:57.181
dressed in nice robes across the way,

1604
01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:59.935
and as you are presented to the main chamber,

1605
01:03:59.935 --> 01:04:04.753
the two Kryn guards keeping just a close eye from behind,

1606
01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:07.261
she puts up her hand to stop the conversation,

1607
01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:09.205
looks over towards the rest of you.

1608
01:04:09.205 --> 01:04:10.038
"Hello.

1609
01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:12.973
"It would seem you have returned.

1610
01:04:12.973 --> 01:04:15.621
"Does this mean good news?"

1611
01:04:15.621 --> 01:04:18.627
SAM: Are we in the safest place to talk?

1612
01:04:18.627 --> 01:04:21.644
MATT: "If you could give us just a moment, please."

1613
01:04:21.644 --> 01:04:22.652
SAM: We'd like to introduce you to

1614
01:04:22.652 --> 01:04:25.127
our associate here, Fjord.

1615
01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:25.960
TRAVIS: It is a pleasure to make

1616
01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.852
your acquaintance, Lady Olios.

1617
01:04:27.852 --> 01:04:29.635
MATT: "The pleasure is mine."

1618
01:04:29.635 --> 01:04:30.514
She puts her hand out.

1619
01:04:30.514 --> 01:04:31.672
TRAVIS: Give it a little kiss.
SAM: Kiss it.

1620
01:04:31.672 --> 01:04:33.422
TRAVIS: I got it, I got it.

1621
01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:39.283
MATT: "So, if this is another one of your companions,

1622
01:04:39.283 --> 01:04:42.431
"how many do you travel with?"

1623
01:04:42.431 --> 01:04:44.997
LAURA: I get confused because we say nine,

1624
01:04:44.997 --> 01:04:46.330
but it's not that many.

1625
01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:47.313
SAM: It's around nine.

1626
01:04:47.313 --> 01:04:49.069
LAURA: It's around nine.

1627
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:50.096
MATT: "Very good.

1628
01:04:50.096 --> 01:04:52.810
"If you, just a few moments."

1629
01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:56.071
The other drow figure leaves the chamber,

1630
01:04:56.071 --> 01:04:58.524
kinda gives a nod as he passes by into the hallway.

1631
01:04:58.524 --> 01:05:00.565
Door closes behind you guys.

1632
01:05:00.565 --> 01:05:04.515
"So, what have you discovered

1633
01:05:04.515 --> 01:05:07.902
"as part of your investigation?"

1634
01:05:07.902 --> 01:05:10.402
LAURA: Lady Olios, there is so much stuff

1635
01:05:10.402 --> 01:05:12.101
happening in your city.

1636
01:05:12.101 --> 01:05:15.583
SAM: Right under your nose and you never knew about it.

1637
01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:17.498
MATT: "Do tell, please."

1638
01:05:17.498 --> 01:05:21.115
TRAVIS: We located a well in the city, we traveled down it

1639
01:05:21.115 --> 01:05:23.680
and found a cavern underneath the soil,

1640
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.744
which opened up into an even larger caverns

1641
01:05:25.744 --> 01:05:28.281
and there there was a rift.

1642
01:05:28.281 --> 01:05:30.969
LAURA: Well, they were making, okay, so we saw this rift

1643
01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:32.411
that was shaped like you know.

1644
01:05:32.411 --> 01:05:34.173
MATT: "Similar to the ones you said you'd found--"

1645
01:05:34.173 --> 01:05:37.769
SAM: There was monsters in progress coming through

1646
01:05:37.769 --> 01:05:39.735
from another plane of existence.

1647
01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:41.078
LAURA: Yeah, and then this big guy came through

1648
01:05:41.078 --> 01:05:43.777
and he was like is the portal complete and stuff?

1649
01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:46.529
Then we were like, oh no, what is he talking about?

1650
01:05:46.529 --> 01:05:47.841
So we killed him!

1651
01:05:47.841 --> 01:05:49.720
SAM: Big fight, big fight.

1652
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.644
Long and short of it, many of us almost died,

1653
01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:53.846
all of them did.

1654
01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:58.846
LAURA: I used my amazing powers to close the rift for you.

1655
01:06:00.348 --> 01:06:02.647
MATT: "So you are more than just an investigator."

1656
01:06:02.647 --> 01:06:05.482
LAURA: I'm a very powerful investigator.

1657
01:06:05.482 --> 01:06:06.868
MATT: "Interesting.

1658
01:06:06.868 --> 01:06:08.104
"Very well."

1659
01:06:08.104 --> 01:06:10.536
SAM: The rift is closed, and you'll be pleased to know

1660
01:06:10.536 --> 01:06:14.942
the more permanent portal for some,

1661
01:06:14.942 --> 01:06:17.435
I don't know the exact mechanics,

1662
01:06:17.435 --> 01:06:18.526
but there was going to be

1663
01:06:18.526 --> 01:06:19.951
a more permanent portal--

1664
01:06:19.951 --> 01:06:21.075
LAURA: Oh, here.

1665
01:06:21.075 --> 01:06:22.619
I pull out the rubbing.

1666
01:06:22.619 --> 01:06:24.430
SAM: For monsters to come through.

1667
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:26.744
LAURA: This was a symbol on it. We fucked up the symbol

1668
01:06:26.744 --> 01:06:29.851
so that they couldn't complete it, though.

1669
01:06:30.793 --> 01:06:32.238
MATT: "Lythir."

1670
01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.858
The door opens, and the male drow who was

1671
01:06:34.858 --> 01:06:37.172
in there previously pokes in the room and goes, "Yes?"

1672
01:06:37.172 --> 01:06:39.960
"Please step inside. I need you to take a look at these

1673
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.627
"and see if you can corroborate some of this information."

1674
01:06:45.508 --> 01:06:47.085
SAM: We have other evidence as well.

1675
01:06:47.085 --> 01:06:48.315
LAURA: Oh, we really do.

1676
01:06:48.315 --> 01:06:49.998
SAM: We found this scroll. Did you give her the scroll yet?

1677
01:06:49.998 --> 01:06:51.152
LAURA: No, not yet.

1678
01:06:51.152 --> 01:06:54.103
SAM: This scroll, if you will translate from the Abyssal.

1679
01:06:54.103 --> 01:06:56.465
We all speak it but you may not.

1680
01:06:56.465 --> 01:06:57.607
(laughter)

1681
01:06:57.607 --> 01:06:59.899
SAM: It gives partial instructions on how to make a more

1682
01:06:59.899 --> 01:07:04.873
permanent portal to the Abyssal plane of existence, I think.

1683
01:07:04.873 --> 01:07:08.206
LAURA: Perhaps the piece de la resistance

1684
01:07:09.455 --> 01:07:10.761
that you're looking for.

1685
01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:12.406
SAM: I don't know if we should.

1686
01:07:12.406 --> 01:07:13.508
I think that's enough.

1687
01:07:13.508 --> 01:07:15.024
TRAVIS: No, might as well.

1688
01:07:15.024 --> 01:07:16.332
SAM: You think so, Fjord?

1689
01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:17.804
TRAVIS: I mean, it is pretty substantial.

1690
01:07:17.804 --> 01:07:19.429
MATT: "What are you all talking about?"

1691
01:07:19.429 --> 01:07:21.452
LAURA: I mean, the favor that you are going to give us

1692
01:07:21.452 --> 01:07:23.407
in exchange is a pretty great favor, I feel like we should--

1693
01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:25.175
SAM: Yes, there is going to be an exchange here, correct?

1694
01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:27.044
We have your word on that?

1695
01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:29.954
MATT: "We will discuss payment once this is

1696
01:07:29.954 --> 01:07:33.621
"an approved conclusion of the investigation."

1697
01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:35.932
SAM: All right.

1698
01:07:35.932 --> 01:07:38.449
LAURA: Should we just-- okay.

1699
01:07:38.449 --> 01:07:43.449
I take out the lead box that's got a thingy in it.

1700
01:07:43.582 --> 01:07:45.749
MATT: "It's got a thingy in it?"

1701
01:07:46.654 --> 01:07:51.596
LAURA: Okay, so this is, like, crazy magical,

1702
01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.559
and also has the ability to open rifts

1703
01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:59.158
into the Abyssal plane, I'm guessing--

1704
01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.928
SAM: Or others, we don't even--

1705
01:08:00.928 --> 01:08:03.571
LAURA: We don't, it could be any plane,

1706
01:08:03.571 --> 01:08:07.859
but we know the Abyssal plane is one that it was working on.

1707
01:08:07.859 --> 01:08:09.628
(laughter)

1708
01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:14.628
LAURA: It looks like a flying saucer, or a fried egg.

1709
01:08:14.689 --> 01:08:16.440
MATT: She looks in for a second,

1710
01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.471
her piercing eyes past her violet skin,

1711
01:08:19.471 --> 01:08:21.471
glancing inside the box.

1712
01:08:23.118 --> 01:08:27.401
Looks over to the other, male drow

1713
01:08:27.401 --> 01:08:29.294
that she introduced as Lythir,

1714
01:08:29.294 --> 01:08:31.466
and gives him a side-eye and he (clears throat)

1715
01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:33.369
steps forward and looks into it.

1716
01:08:33.369 --> 01:08:35.259
Brings his hand up and you see his fingers trace

1717
01:08:35.259 --> 01:08:37.983
a similar series of symbols and shapes

1718
01:08:37.983 --> 01:08:40.560
as you've seen Caleb do a number of times,

1719
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.004
when looking into the affirmation of various magical objects

1720
01:08:44.004 --> 01:08:46.202
and what their capabilities are.

1721
01:08:46.202 --> 01:08:48.327
You specifically have seen this many times,

1722
01:08:48.327 --> 01:08:51.278
you've studied Caleb's, you know, incantations in the past.

1723
01:08:51.278 --> 01:08:53.740
The eyes briefly glaze over

1724
01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:56.579
and then there's a moment of realization.

1725
01:08:56.579 --> 01:08:59.651
"This is as they say, actually.

1726
01:08:59.651 --> 01:09:02.093
"It is quite powerful

1727
01:09:02.093 --> 01:09:03.600
"and is Abyssal in nature."

1728
01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.843
TRAVIS: Can I tell if he's ever seen this before?

1729
01:09:05.843 --> 01:09:07.278
MATT: Make an Insight check.

1730
01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:09.083
SAM: Fjord.

1731
01:09:09.083 --> 01:09:11.176
LAURA: Yeah, smart thinking there, Fjord.

1732
01:09:11.176 --> 01:09:12.009
TRAVIS: 17.

1733
01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:13.483
MATT: 17.

1734
01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:14.697
SAM: Whispers!

1735
01:09:14.697 --> 01:09:15.763
LAURA: Ooh!

1736
01:09:15.763 --> 01:09:16.722
SAM: Wow!

1737
01:09:16.722 --> 01:09:17.985
TRAVIS: Gimme gimme.

1738
01:09:17.985 --> 01:09:20.848
SAM: What if we looked over and Matt and Travis

1739
01:09:20.848 --> 01:09:22.406
were just making out--
LAURA: Making out?

1740
01:09:22.406 --> 01:09:23.669
SAM: Just like in it.

1741
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:25.836
LAURA: With caramel aftertaste.

1742
01:09:26.842 --> 01:09:28.465
MARISHA: Just taking the opportunity.

1743
01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:30.728
LIAM: That's how Matt imparts wisdom.

1744
01:09:30.728 --> 01:09:32.524
(laughter)

1745
01:09:32.524 --> 01:09:34.533
SAM: Oh boy, guys.

1746
01:09:34.533 --> 01:09:35.926
LAURA: (laughs)

1747
01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:37.744
SAM: Hey, that Kickstarter's still going on.

1748
01:09:37.744 --> 01:09:39.708
(laughter)

1749
01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:40.541
MATT: All right.

1750
01:09:40.541 --> 01:09:41.374
Sorry.

1751
01:09:41.374 --> 01:09:43.241
LIAM: Yeah, I'm just thinking about them making out now.

1752
01:09:43.241 --> 01:09:45.026
(laughter)

1753
01:09:45.026 --> 01:09:50.026
MATT: She goes, "Well, and it's still working, you say?"

1754
01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:52.847
LAURA: I mean, it seemed like, I mean we didn't

1755
01:09:52.847 --> 01:09:54.946
turn it off or anything, you know?

1756
01:09:54.946 --> 01:09:57.088
MATT: He looks back to her and goes, "Might I, please?"

1757
01:09:57.088 --> 01:09:58.694
She goes, "Of course."

1758
01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.450
He reaches forward and grabs one of the crystals

1759
01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:03.906
and pops it out, and you watch it (sputter).

1760
01:10:03.906 --> 01:10:06.199
The glowing orange light slowly fades

1761
01:10:06.199 --> 01:10:08.600
and the mercury that was spinning rapidly inside the orb

1762
01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.529
comes to rest as a little (flittering)

1763
01:10:11.529 --> 01:10:12.718
at the bottom of the orb.

1764
01:10:12.718 --> 01:10:15.893
TRAVIS: We forgot to mention, it's fragile.

1765
01:10:15.893 --> 01:10:19.093
MATT: He throws the crystal in the box and goes,

1766
01:10:19.093 --> 01:10:21.382
"Yes, but its functioning is very dangerous

1767
01:10:21.382 --> 01:10:23.525
"to be allowed to maintain.

1768
01:10:23.525 --> 01:10:25.422
"The last thing we need--"

1769
01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:28.090
LAURA: We wanted you guys to be the ones to (clicks tongue).

1770
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:33.047
She looks. "Well, this is actually quite impressive.

1771
01:10:33.047 --> 01:10:37.973
"And if this does indeed stop the issues we've been having

1772
01:10:37.973 --> 01:10:40.870
"that have been escalating in the recent month,

1773
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:44.733
"you have done a great service to the Dynasty."

1774
01:10:44.733 --> 01:10:47.972
SAM: That's why we're here, to do service to the Dynasty.

1775
01:10:47.972 --> 01:10:50.171
MATT: "What of the spy?"

1776
01:10:50.171 --> 01:10:53.241
LAURA: Nothing yet on that front, but we did find out

1777
01:10:53.241 --> 01:10:55.342
that one of the reasons people were

1778
01:10:55.342 --> 01:10:57.612
killing each other in town, you know?

1779
01:10:57.612 --> 01:11:01.726
Are because there was a couple of

1780
01:11:01.726 --> 01:11:05.843
succubus incubus people. They had wings and stuff

1781
01:11:05.843 --> 01:11:07.720
and they were whispering in people's ears

1782
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.917
and being like go kill your friends or your family,

1783
01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:12.931
and then people would do it.

1784
01:11:12.931 --> 01:11:15.752
MATT: "You have also dealt with these creatures?"

1785
01:11:15.752 --> 01:11:17.101
LAURA: Yeah, they're deads.

1786
01:11:17.101 --> 01:11:19.138
SAM: They were ghosty, so we don't really have

1787
01:11:19.138 --> 01:11:20.815
much proof of that.

1788
01:11:20.815 --> 01:11:21.945
LAURA: They turned to sludge.

1789
01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:23.888
TRAVIS: They were quite powerful, unfortunately.

1790
01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:25.687
The one thing you should keep in mind

1791
01:11:25.687 --> 01:11:30.687
is that this device was obviously planted there by someone.

1792
01:11:31.015 --> 01:11:33.015
MATT: "(sighs)

1793
01:11:34.224 --> 01:11:37.198
"We shall keep an eye, then."

1794
01:11:37.198 --> 01:11:38.793
Make a Persuasion check for me,

1795
01:11:38.793 --> 01:11:42.286
about the lack of proof but convincing

1796
01:11:42.286 --> 01:11:44.919
that you have taken care of these creatures.

1797
01:11:44.919 --> 01:11:48.987
LAURA: No, but with advantage, because Fjord helped me?

1798
01:11:48.987 --> 01:11:51.612
MATT: You've all been diving into the conversation.

1799
01:11:51.612 --> 01:11:52.770
I'll allow the advantage, sure.

1800
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:54.130
(laughter)

1801
01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:55.880
SAM: That was very kind.

1802
01:11:58.266 --> 01:11:59.099
LAURA: (groans in relief)

1803
01:11:59.099 --> 01:11:59.932
SAM: Extremely kind.

1804
01:12:01.054 --> 01:12:02.034
LAURA: Okay.

1805
01:12:02.034 --> 01:12:03.088
MATT: It's not going to change much.

1806
01:12:03.088 --> 01:12:03.966
LAURA: 21?

1807
01:12:03.966 --> 01:12:05.394
MATT: 21, okay.

1808
01:12:05.394 --> 01:12:08.432
She gives a nod and goes, "All right.

1809
01:12:08.432 --> 01:12:09.265
"Well."

1810
01:12:10.728 --> 01:12:11.561
(sighs)

1811
01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:13.981
LAURA: There was a bugbear. There was a bugbear.

1812
01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:15.773
MATT: "There are many."

1813
01:12:15.773 --> 01:12:17.480
SAM: There was a bugbear who's been affected by these,

1814
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.959
haunted by these dreams, he killed his neighbor's dogs,

1815
01:12:20.959 --> 01:12:22.012
right, is that right?

1816
01:12:22.012 --> 01:12:25.488
LAURA: Yeah, and when we saw him, he was being

1817
01:12:25.488 --> 01:12:27.992
mind-controlled by them, they were dressed up as--

1818
01:12:27.992 --> 01:12:29.353
SAM: Not just mind-controlled--

1819
01:12:29.353 --> 01:12:30.325
MATT: "What was this bugbear's name?"

1820
01:12:30.325 --> 01:12:33.199
SAM: This bugbear's name was, of course, Gluzzo?

1821
01:12:33.199 --> 01:12:34.032
No.

1822
01:12:34.032 --> 01:12:35.306
TRAVIS: Kaulden, nope.

1823
01:12:35.306 --> 01:12:36.889
SAM: Gimmel? Nope.

1824
01:12:36.889 --> 01:12:38.789
Lady Zethriss.

1825
01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:40.241
Gluzzo.

1826
01:12:40.241 --> 01:12:41.991
Gluzzo!

1827
01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:43.463
Nope, that was the one who got us--

1828
01:12:43.463 --> 01:12:46.199
MATT: Gluzzo. We will take care of this Gluzzo figure.

1829
01:12:46.199 --> 01:12:49.692
SAM: No no, it was not Gluzzo. It was not Gluzzo.

1830
01:12:49.692 --> 01:12:52.352
LAURA: Okay, and here's the thing, he wasn't doing,

1831
01:12:52.352 --> 01:12:53.487
here's the thing.

1832
01:12:53.487 --> 01:12:54.605
SAM: It was Umadon.

1833
01:12:54.605 --> 01:12:55.484
Umadon!

1834
01:12:55.484 --> 01:12:56.712
LAURA: He was doing anything.

1835
01:12:56.712 --> 01:12:58.506
He maybe did some bad stuff, but it's because

1836
01:12:58.506 --> 01:13:00.627
he was mind-controlled, right?

1837
01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:02.773
So we took care of the things that were mind-controlling him

1838
01:13:02.773 --> 01:13:04.779
and now he will be fine. He was dreaming about

1839
01:13:04.779 --> 01:13:06.673
these sexy bugbears.

1840
01:13:06.673 --> 01:13:09.250
SAM: He was under the evil corruption of these

1841
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:13.167
incubuses and succubuses, but now he's free and clear.

1842
01:13:13.167 --> 01:13:14.800
All we're saying is you could go talk to him

1843
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.673
if you needed any corroboration as to the dreams.

1844
01:13:17.673 --> 01:13:19.171
LAURA: He was seeing some sexy bugbears

1845
01:13:19.171 --> 01:13:20.645
and he would be able to tell you that.

1846
01:13:20.645 --> 01:13:22.466
MATT: "We will inquire about the sexy bugbears

1847
01:13:22.466 --> 01:13:25.719
"with this Umadon, and also keep a watch

1848
01:13:25.719 --> 01:13:29.160
"just to ensure that such behavior does not continue."

1849
01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.448
LAURA: Yeah.

1850
01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:31.281
SAM: Well.

1851
01:13:32.334 --> 01:13:34.975
MATT: "That is one job well done."

1852
01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:35.864
LAURA: Great.

1853
01:13:35.864 --> 01:13:39.338
MATT: She takes the box away from you,

1854
01:13:39.338 --> 01:13:43.019
and puts the rubbings over on the desk and goes,

1855
01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:45.667
"Very well, so, successful contract

1856
01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:50.184
"puts you at a benefit of 10,000 gold pieces."

1857
01:13:51.624 --> 01:13:52.918
SAM: Or a favor.

1858
01:13:52.918 --> 01:13:55.847
MATT: "You wish to have favor of the Bright Queen.

1859
01:13:55.847 --> 01:13:58.678
"Very well, that will greatly diminish

1860
01:13:58.678 --> 01:14:00.396
"the amount of the reward."

1861
01:14:00.396 --> 01:14:03.565
LAURA: What exactly does the favor do for us, though?

1862
01:14:03.565 --> 01:14:07.899
MATT: "Well, you would have to present what you have done

1863
01:14:07.899 --> 01:14:10.137
"before the Bright Queen, and then the favor

1864
01:14:10.137 --> 01:14:12.850
"would be granted by what she sees fit."

01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:15.260
SAM: Who's the Bright Queen?

1866
01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:17.299
Is that the leader of--

01:14:17.299 --> 01:14:19.049
MATT: "Where are you from?"

1868
01:14:20.487 --> 01:14:21.668
LAURA: So, so--

1869
01:14:21.668 --> 01:14:23.918
SAM: A roving band of goblins?

1870
01:14:24.809 --> 01:14:28.871
MATT: "But a fine investigator who seems to be

1871
01:14:28.871 --> 01:14:32.421
"diving into aiding the Empire."

1872
01:14:32.421 --> 01:14:35.728
LAURA: Yeah, only a few years ago, Nott separated from

1873
01:14:35.728 --> 01:14:37.699
her band and decided to, you know, become

1874

more of a productive member of society,

1875
01:14:41.359 --> 01:14:44.108
and some things haven't been filled in yet--

1876

LAURA: Make a Deception check.

1877
01:14:46.618 --> 01:14:48.400
SAM: I missed a lot of things.

1878
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.952
I still think doo-wop music is current.

1879

Of course, yes.

SAM: More of a tonal language.

Like there's six tones and they all,

MATT: "I will take you myself."

1914
01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:19.366
LAURA: Whoa.

1915
01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:21.226
TRAVIS: Even better.

1916
01:16:21.226 --> 01:16:22.855
Most gracious of you.

1917
01:16:22.855 --> 01:16:24.529
LAURA: So we bought some moorbounders

1918
01:16:24.529 --> 01:16:25.737
because we were going to go ourselves.

1919
01:16:25.737 --> 01:16:29.237
Do we still need those then, do you think?

1920
01:16:30.478 --> 01:16:32.840
MATT: "You do not need them.

1921
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.923
"We can try to fit them, but the space is a bit...

1922
01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:40.198
"I'll leave that up to you."

1923
01:16:40.198 --> 01:16:41.739
LAURA: Yeah, we'll figure it out.

1924
01:16:41.739 --> 01:16:46.739
MATT: The other drow says, "My lady, if there is travel

1925
01:16:46.839 --> 01:16:49.508
"to Rosohna, I would also like to come, if that is

1926
01:16:49.508 --> 01:16:53.330
"all right." "Of course, of course, you will accompany us.

1927
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:55.402
"So, gather the rest of your team, then,

1928
01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:59.093
"and when you're ready, I will escort you.

1929
01:16:59.093 --> 01:17:02.059
"We will make the rest of this debt paid."

1930
01:17:02.059 --> 01:17:02.892
LAURA: Wow.

1931
01:17:02.892 --> 01:17:06.393
Thank you so much. That's a large favor for us.

1932
01:17:06.393 --> 01:17:09.663
SAM: Your friend, what is his name, Lythus?

1933
01:17:09.663 --> 01:17:10.496
MATT: "Lythir."

1934
01:17:10.496 --> 01:17:12.084
SAM: Lythir will be joining us?

1935
01:17:12.084 --> 01:17:13.805
MATT: "At least for the travel, right?"

1936
01:17:13.805 --> 01:17:16.940
He goes, "Yes, I just was going to request

1937
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.803
"transference anyway."

1938
01:17:18.803 --> 01:17:21.428
TRAVIS: Only so I can close my books on the matter,

1939
01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:23.509
I know it reduced the coin that came

1940
01:17:23.509 --> 01:17:26.597
from completing our task, but what is the reduced amount?

1941
01:17:26.597 --> 01:17:28.823
MATT: "The final amount with the favor

1942
01:17:28.823 --> 01:17:30.610
"will bring you to 2000 gold."

1943
01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:32.527
TRAVIS: Excellent, thank you.

1944
01:17:34.728 --> 01:17:37.342
SAM: Well, should we pack?

1945
01:17:37.342 --> 01:17:38.618
Should we pack and meet back here--

1946
01:17:38.618 --> 01:17:39.451
MATT: "Prepare yourselves."

1947
01:17:39.451 --> 01:17:40.501
SAM: In like 25 minutes, or--?

1948
01:17:40.501 --> 01:17:41.755
LAURA: Yeah, like how long until--

1949
01:17:41.755 --> 01:17:43.051
MATT: "Well, let us get you paid first."

1950
01:17:43.051 --> 01:17:44.468
She steps out of the chamber

1951
01:17:44.468 --> 01:17:45.776
and gathers one of the servants.

1952
01:17:45.776 --> 01:17:48.450
You watch as one of the goblins scoots in

1953
01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:51.610
and listens to her, darts out, and then returns

1954
01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:53.806
about five minutes later with a heavy satchel

1955
01:17:53.806 --> 01:17:55.955
that is jingling with coin, fairly heavy,

1956
01:17:55.955 --> 01:17:58.747
and passes it over to you, and it seems to be,

1957
01:17:58.747 --> 01:18:01.055
if you take a moment to glance through,

1958
01:18:01.055 --> 01:18:03.336
somewhere in the neighborhood of probably what was promised.

1959
01:18:03.336 --> 01:18:05.307
You know, if you wish to stop and take the time

1960
01:18:05.307 --> 01:18:06.996
to count in front of her, you gather it probably

1961
01:18:06.996 --> 01:18:08.848
might be a bit offensive.

1962
01:18:08.848 --> 01:18:10.547
TRAVIS: I'm sure I'll be fine.

1963
01:18:10.547 --> 01:18:11.534
Feels right.

1964
01:18:11.534 --> 01:18:13.853
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1965
01:18:13.853 --> 01:18:15.930
TRAVIS: Well, let us gather our comrades

1966
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:18.130
and we will meet you outside.

1967
01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:18.995
LAURA: Later.

1968
01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:20.102
We'll come back.

1969
01:18:20.102 --> 01:18:20.935
We'll come back?

1970
01:18:20.935 --> 01:18:22.140
SAM: At sundown?

1971
01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:22.973
LAURA: Do you have a specific time that would

1972
01:18:22.973 --> 01:18:24.411
be good for you?

1973
01:18:24.411 --> 01:18:25.404
MATT: "Sundown should be fine.

1974
01:18:25.404 --> 01:18:27.375
"That gives us an hour to prepare."

1975
01:18:27.375 --> 01:18:30.150
SAM: Great. See you then.

1976
01:18:31.074 --> 01:18:32.422
Pleasure doing business with you.

1977
01:18:32.422 --> 01:18:34.004
LAURA: Thank you so much.

1978
01:18:34.004 --> 01:18:34.854
SAM: Thank you.

1979
01:18:34.854 --> 01:18:38.059
LAURA: You're looking really pretty today, by the way.

1980
01:18:38.059 --> 01:18:40.613
TRAVIS: This is that entrance where the left side

1981
01:18:40.613 --> 01:18:42.766
goes into her chambers and the right side

1982
01:18:42.766 --> 01:18:44.021
goes into another one, or no?

1983
01:18:44.021 --> 01:18:46.528
MATT: As you head down the hallway, to the right

1984
01:18:46.528 --> 01:18:48.350
leads to her chambers, the hall continues on,

1985
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:50.832
and there are other doors, but they're all closed.

1986
01:18:50.832 --> 01:18:52.126
As soon as you exit the room,

1987
01:18:52.126 --> 01:18:53.334
the guards are right there.

1988
01:18:53.334 --> 01:18:57.879
There's two full Kryn soldiers that are just at your sides,

1989
01:18:57.879 --> 01:19:00.257
essentially waiting for you to leave.

1990
01:19:00.257 --> 01:19:02.427
TRAVIS: Another day, another job done, right?

1991
01:19:02.427 --> 01:19:03.760
Keeping it safe.

1992
01:19:05.086 --> 01:19:07.244
LAURA: We're going out.

1993
01:19:07.244 --> 01:19:08.632
MATT: (laughs) No response.

1994
01:19:08.632 --> 01:19:10.522
SAM: Light be with you.

1995
01:19:10.522 --> 01:19:12.513
MATT: One of them gives a nod.

1996
01:19:12.513 --> 01:19:15.665
You guys exit the Aurora Hold?

1997
01:19:15.665 --> 01:19:17.877
LAURA: I ring the bell as we leave.

1998
01:19:17.877 --> 01:19:20.512
MATT: (laughs) The other bell?

1999
01:19:20.512 --> 01:19:22.446
As you leave again, the other door, "Huh, what?"

2000
01:19:22.446 --> 01:19:27.393
The same servant looks in there frustrated as he...

2001
01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:30.592
You guys exit and you gather the rest of your troops here.

2002
01:19:30.592 --> 01:19:32.334
You guys, as you're waiting outside carefully

2003
01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:35.654
in the alleyway, it's been about 15, 20 minutes

2004
01:19:35.654 --> 01:19:38.867
since they left, in the process of them

2005
01:19:38.867 --> 01:19:41.622
getting the attention, traveling, having the conversation,

2006
01:19:41.622 --> 01:19:43.349
and returning, so yeah, you're pushing

2007
01:19:43.349 --> 01:19:44.268
close to half an hour.

2008
01:19:44.268 --> 01:19:45.563
MARISHA: Nothing weird happened on the outside?

2009
01:19:45.563 --> 01:19:46.437
We're all good?

2010
01:19:46.437 --> 01:19:48.604
MATT: Make a Perception check.

2011
01:19:50.799 --> 01:19:52.549
MARISHA: Not good, not good.

2012
01:19:53.441 --> 01:19:54.471
Ten.

2013
01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:55.304
MATT: Ten?

2014
01:19:55.304 --> 01:19:56.506
Nothing strange catches your eye.

2015
01:19:56.506 --> 01:19:59.450
The usual bustle and business around the city.

2016
01:19:59.450 --> 01:20:00.665
As far as what you've encountered.

2017
01:20:00.665 --> 01:20:04.055
I mean, it's common here, but it's still just

2018
01:20:04.055 --> 01:20:05.727
something you're getting used to.

2019
01:20:05.727 --> 01:20:08.057
The wide array of interesting creatures

2020
01:20:08.057 --> 01:20:13.053
that call this place home, the sometimes brutish

2021
01:20:13.053 --> 01:20:15.954
comparative day to day activities,

2022
01:20:15.954 --> 01:20:17.752
or at least what seems to be brutish

2023
01:20:17.752 --> 01:20:20.446
construction seems very violent.

2024
01:20:20.446 --> 01:20:22.274
You know, the feeding and care taking

2025
01:20:22.274 --> 01:20:25.396
of various beasts of burden seems dangerous.

2026
01:20:25.396 --> 01:20:27.255
Nothing that catches your eye

2027
01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:31.264
as worthy of further investigation.

2028
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:35.547
The rest of your team does gather up to you.

2029
01:20:35.547 --> 01:20:36.571
SAM: Hey.

2030
01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:37.732
Went great in there.

2031
01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.416
LAURA: Oh my gosh, she loves us.

2032
01:20:39.416 --> 01:20:41.998
SAM: We're going to go meet-- we got escalated.

2033
01:20:41.998 --> 01:20:43.751
We're going to meet the Light Queen.

2034
01:20:43.751 --> 01:20:44.673
MARISHA: What?

2035
01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.140
SAM: Which I might need some clarification.

2036
01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.334
Is that a person or a deity?

2037
01:20:48.334 --> 01:20:51.553
LAURA: No, that's a person, man. As far as I know,

2038
01:20:51.553 --> 01:20:53.781
she's the head of the Kryn empire.

2039
01:20:53.781 --> 01:20:54.763
LIAM: Empress.

2040
01:20:54.763 --> 01:20:55.940
LAURA: She's the empress!

2041
01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.298
SAM: Empress Leylas Kryn?

2042
01:20:57.298 --> 01:20:58.239
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2043
01:20:58.239 --> 01:21:00.609
LAIM: You're taking us-- we're going to meet the empress?

2044
01:21:00.609 --> 01:21:03.333
SAM: I thought that she was talking about some god.

2045
01:21:03.333 --> 01:21:04.166
The Light Queen.

2046
01:21:04.166 --> 01:21:05.691
LAURA: No man, I'm pretty sure she meant

2047
01:21:05.691 --> 01:21:07.366
the frickin' empress.

2048
01:21:07.366 --> 01:21:08.499
SAM: That's crazy.

2049
01:21:08.499 --> 01:21:10.357
LAURA: Or maybe she was talking about

2050
01:21:10.357 --> 01:21:11.815
the head of the church.

2051
01:21:11.815 --> 01:21:13.665
SAM: I don't know, do you know?

2052
01:21:13.665 --> 01:21:15.340
LIAM: I was not there.

2053
01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.351
SAM: Yasha, do you know what the Light Queen is?

2054
01:21:18.351 --> 01:21:21.368
MATT: "I was not privy to politics."

2055
01:21:22.392 --> 01:21:24.199
LAURA: See what I mean? See, it's possible for you to be

2056
01:21:24.199 --> 01:21:25.545
part of the empire and not know.

2057
01:21:25.545 --> 01:21:26.378
SAM: But we're going to another place,

2058
01:21:26.378 --> 01:21:28.008
a place called Rosebud?

2059
01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.708
(confused mumbling)

2060
01:21:29.708 --> 01:21:30.841
SAM: Rosohna?

2061
01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:33.066
LAURA: Rosie Cosieburgs.

2062
01:21:34.401 --> 01:21:36.382
MATT: "I don't-- sorry, I don't know that--"

2063
01:21:36.382 --> 01:21:38.930
SAM: No, not you Yasha. Matt behind her.

2064
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:42.638
(laughter)

2065
01:21:42.638 --> 01:21:43.610
TRAVIS: Yasha, go!

2066
01:21:46.086 --> 01:21:47.693
MATT: Yeah, Rosohna.

2067
01:21:47.693 --> 01:21:48.639
LAURA: Rosohna.

2068
01:21:48.639 --> 01:21:49.553
LIAM: Sona?

2069
01:21:49.553 --> 01:21:50.470
MATT: Rosohna.

2070
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:54.267
Like R-O-S-O-H-N-A.

2071
01:21:54.267 --> 01:21:57.280
SAM: ♪ Rosohna in the highest ♪

2072
01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.637
(laughter)

2073
01:21:59.637 --> 01:22:02.243
TRAVIS: So we made it in, we presented our evidence.

2074
01:22:02.243 --> 01:22:04.524
It's important to note, though,

2075
01:22:04.524 --> 01:22:07.157
that she did have a drow fella come in and check out

2076
01:22:07.157 --> 01:22:10.583
that little frisbee looking thing, yeah.

2077
01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:12.663
He seemed a little jumpy.

2078
01:22:12.663 --> 01:22:15.066
I don't know if it was because he was intimidated

2079
01:22:15.066 --> 01:22:17.672
by what he was seeing or if--

2080
01:22:17.672 --> 01:22:19.655
LIAM: Did he seem suspicious of you?

2081
01:22:19.655 --> 01:22:21.762
TRAVIS: Not of us, he seemed suspicious.

2082
01:22:21.762 --> 01:22:23.286
SAM: He also said, did you catch that at the end?

2083
01:22:23.286 --> 01:22:26.882
Where he said I wanted to put in for a transfer anyway?

2084
01:22:26.882 --> 01:22:27.715
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2085
01:22:27.715 --> 01:22:28.994
SAM: Like he wants to get out of this place?

2086
01:22:28.994 --> 01:22:32.503
TRAVIS: He's headed the same place we are in a hurry.

2087
01:22:32.503 --> 01:22:36.419
I couldn't tell if he was just upset by the power

2088
01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:38.619
of what he was seeing or the implications of it,

2089
01:22:38.619 --> 01:22:41.034
or if maybe he knew something he wasn't letting on.

2090
01:22:41.034 --> 01:22:42.945
But he might be somebody to watch.

2091
01:22:42.945 --> 01:22:45.986
He had a little bit of the arcane flair that you do.

2092
01:22:45.986 --> 01:22:47.620
Just saying.

2093
01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.268
LIAM: When do we leave? Tomorrow?

2094
01:22:49.268 --> 01:22:50.281
TRAVIS: Tonight.
LIAM: Tonight?

2095
01:22:50.281 --> 01:22:51.300
TRAVIS: Right before sunfall.

2096
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.586
Down, sundown.

2097
01:22:52.586 --> 01:22:53.802
SAM: In an hour.

2098
01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.369
LIAM: What about the big cats?

2099
01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:56.955
SAM: Let's go round them up.

2100
01:22:56.955 --> 01:22:58.843
Maybe they can come with us.

2101
01:22:58.843 --> 01:22:59.676
LIAM: Maybe.

2102
01:22:59.676 --> 01:23:01.078
LAURA: Or we get our money back.

2103
01:23:01.078 --> 01:23:02.927
TRAVIS: We're going to bring the cats, all right?

2104
01:23:02.927 --> 01:23:04.857
We might trail behind the caravan a bit,

2105
01:23:04.857 --> 01:23:06.747
but we set the tone here, all right?

2106
01:23:06.747 --> 01:23:07.946
MARISHA: Did she say how we're traveling?

2107
01:23:07.946 --> 01:23:10.068
LAURA: No, what if it's just like a--

2108
01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:11.467
MARISHA: Teleportation.

2109
01:23:11.467 --> 01:23:14.834
TRAVIS: Well, then hope it's big enough for some kitties.

2110
01:23:14.834 --> 01:23:18.003
SAM: Because we just plunked down a big amount of money

2111
01:23:18.003 --> 01:23:19.288
on these bad boys.

2112
01:23:19.288 --> 01:23:20.818
TRAVIS: Might just leave them here. We'll find out.

2113
01:23:20.818 --> 01:23:23.294
LIAM: We have about 30 to 40 minutes left.

2114
01:23:23.294 --> 01:23:25.027
SAM: Yes, you could do some book shopping.

2115
01:23:25.027 --> 01:23:27.857
LIAM: No, with this, our disguise.

2116
01:23:27.857 --> 01:23:31.067
We can't just hang around, we need to go somewhere or go--

2117
01:23:31.067 --> 01:23:32.310
where are we meeting them?

2118
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:33.643
LAURA: Here.
SAM: Here.

2119
01:23:33.643 --> 01:23:36.114
LIAM: Do we need to do anything? Does anyone need

2120
01:23:36.114 --> 01:23:37.405
to do anything before we go?

2121
01:23:37.405 --> 01:23:39.914
LAURA: I kind of need to pee, but outside of that.

2122
01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.318
SAM: Butcher for sure.

2123
01:23:41.318 --> 01:23:42.172
Meat.

2124
01:23:42.172 --> 01:23:43.788
We got to go get the animals.

2125
01:23:43.788 --> 01:23:45.428
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's get the animals and come on back.

2126
01:23:45.428 --> 01:23:47.859
That's all I can think of.

2127
01:23:47.859 --> 01:23:48.942
MARISHA: How are we--

2128
01:23:50.072 --> 01:23:51.578
SAM: Should I just run by?

2129
01:23:51.578 --> 01:23:52.643
MARISHA: --going to do this?

2130
01:23:52.643 --> 01:23:54.374
LIAM: We have to change.

2131
01:23:55.416 --> 01:23:58.124
MARISHA: But how are we going to do this for that long?

2132
01:23:59.652 --> 01:24:02.624
LIAM: It's good that we were not in there.

2133
01:24:02.624 --> 01:24:04.075
TRAVIS: Did you guys not-- you weren't

2134
01:24:04.075 --> 01:24:05.102
for the first audience, were you?

2135
01:24:05.102 --> 01:24:06.026
LIAM: No.

2136
01:24:06.026 --> 01:24:08.609
TRAVIS: You guys might be our slaves.

2137
01:24:09.474 --> 01:24:10.702
Right?

2138
01:24:10.702 --> 01:24:11.932
You might work for us.

2139
01:24:11.932 --> 01:24:14.145
Well, I mean, they weren't in the first audience

2140
01:24:14.145 --> 01:24:14.978
or this one.

2141
01:24:14.978 --> 01:24:15.811
SAM: No.

2142
01:24:15.811 --> 01:24:16.644
TRAVIS: And we certainly don't want to be seen

2143
01:24:16.644 --> 01:24:17.477
traveling with humans.

2144
01:24:17.477 --> 01:24:20.434
so casually, so maybe they work for us.

2145
01:24:20.434 --> 01:24:21.894
SAM: Should we go buy some leather straps

2146
01:24:21.894 --> 01:24:23.484
and strap you guys up like you're--

2147
01:24:23.484 --> 01:24:24.497
TRAVIS: Some buckles?

2148
01:24:24.497 --> 01:24:25.386
SAM: Yeah.

2149
01:24:25.386 --> 01:24:26.387
TRAVIS: Some harnesses?

2150
01:24:26.387 --> 01:24:27.966
LAURA: I've seen some of those before,

2151
01:24:27.966 --> 01:24:29.516
my mom said there were some clients--

2152
01:24:29.516 --> 01:24:30.474
MARISHA: This feels so degrading.

2153
01:24:30.474 --> 01:24:32.137
LIAM: I don't like it either, but I think it is maybe--

2154
01:24:32.137 --> 01:24:34.238
we don't know what we're walking into,

2155
01:24:34.238 --> 01:24:35.727
what the situation is yet.

2156
01:24:35.727 --> 01:24:36.874
SAM: Some leather straps.

2157
01:24:36.874 --> 01:24:39.181
LIAM: I cannot do this for longer than short bursts of time.

2158
01:24:39.181 --> 01:24:40.264
MARISHA: No, I know.

2159
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:45.338
MATT: "We all wearing straps, or--?"

2160
01:24:45.338 --> 01:24:46.806
SAM: No, I don't think--

2161
01:24:46.806 --> 01:24:48.420
LAURA: Only if you want to, Caduceus.

2162
01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:49.417
TRAVIS: You're actually all right.

2163
01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.672
MATT: "I don't know what that means, but okay."

2164
01:24:51.672 --> 01:24:54.663
(laughter)

2165
01:24:54.663 --> 01:24:56.310
SAM: Should we get a set for Yasha, too, or--?

2166
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:57.976
TRAVIS: No, she's fine.

2167
01:24:57.976 --> 01:24:59.725
As we're heading to go get the moorbounders,

2168
01:24:59.725 --> 01:25:02.871
are there any like stables or areas

2169
01:25:02.871 --> 01:25:05.371
that might have such apparati?

2170
01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:09.240
MATT: The stables have all sorts of harnesses,

2171
01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.937
but they're designed for moorbounders.

2172
01:25:10.937 --> 01:25:13.394
TRAVIS: That's fine, we'll make use.

2173
01:25:13.394 --> 01:25:14.675
Slide that shit over your shoulder.

2174
01:25:14.675 --> 01:25:16.974
MATT: You can go and ask Zorth.

2175
01:25:16.974 --> 01:25:17.807
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2176
01:25:17.807 --> 01:25:20.204
MATT: You come in he's like, "And welcome back!

2177
01:25:20.204 --> 01:25:21.887
"So nice to see you. Glad you're coming back

2178
01:25:21.887 --> 01:25:23.629
"for your beasties. We've been feedin' them.

2179
01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:25.682
"They're quite hungry. Growing beasts, you know."

2180
01:25:25.682 --> 01:25:26.691
TRAVIS: Good, I'm glad.

2181
01:25:26.691 --> 01:25:29.722
We're actually going to take off this very evening.

2182
01:25:29.722 --> 01:25:30.555
MATT: "So soon?"

2183
01:25:30.555 --> 01:25:32.587
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have a question, because you've been

2184
01:25:32.587 --> 01:25:34.452
such a fantastic business partner,

2185
01:25:34.452 --> 01:25:37.763
if I had told you to outfit these two gentlefolk here

2186
01:25:37.763 --> 01:25:40.634
with, I don't know, maybe some rigging, some harnesses,

2187
01:25:40.634 --> 01:25:42.448
what would you say might work?

2188
01:25:42.448 --> 01:25:44.904
LIAM: I would along the way have jumped into an alley

2189
01:25:44.904 --> 01:25:47.911
and turned myself into the twin of Jester.

2190
01:25:47.911 --> 01:25:48.744
MATT: Okay, right.

2191
01:25:48.744 --> 01:25:49.934
MARISHA: Am I still a tiefling?

2192
01:25:49.934 --> 01:25:51.826
LIAM: Yes, you're fine as long as we're in

2193
01:25:51.826 --> 01:25:53.743
a small amount of time.

2194
01:25:55.039 --> 01:25:56.914
MATT: "I mean, if that's what you want

2195
01:25:56.914 --> 01:25:58.096
"I'm not one to judge.

2196
01:25:58.096 --> 01:25:59.413
"But certainly.

2197
01:25:59.413 --> 01:26:03.271
"Per harness runs you about-- I could probably get

2198
01:26:03.271 --> 01:26:06.309
"both of you with one harness amount of leather, so--"

2199
01:26:06.309 --> 01:26:08.524
SAM: Two harnesses, two harnesses.

2200
01:26:08.524 --> 01:26:10.654
MATT: "All right, all right. Hey, who am I

2201
01:26:10.654 --> 01:26:12.680
"to not want to sell more? Put you at two gold pieces

2202
01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.094
"for the two harnesses, eh?"

2203
01:26:14.094 --> 01:26:15.940
MARISHA: 10 gold pieces?

2204
01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.641
LAURA: They're huge harnesses. Why do we need

2205
01:26:17.641 --> 01:26:18.494
one for each of them?

2206
01:26:18.494 --> 01:26:19.414
TRAVIS: Easy, servant.

2207
01:26:19.414 --> 01:26:20.442
10 gold pieces sounds fine.

2208
01:26:20.442 --> 01:26:21.564
MATT: "Yeah!"

2209
01:26:21.564 --> 01:26:23.410
TRAVIS: Could you make some modifications so it fits them

2210
01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:24.842
a little tighter, a little more snug,

2211
01:26:24.842 --> 01:26:25.983
like they've been wearing it a bit?

2212
01:26:25.983 --> 01:26:26.816
MATT: Yeah, we can take care of that.

2213
01:26:26.816 --> 01:26:27.982
"Hold on just a second.

2214
01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.251
"Boys!"

2215
01:26:29.251 --> 01:26:32.588
Calls the other goblins over and instructs them.

2216
01:26:32.588 --> 01:26:34.623
They gather the harnesses, and--

2217
01:26:34.623 --> 01:26:35.743
TRAVIS: I got it.

2218
01:26:35.743 --> 01:26:37.758
MATT: They swarm around you making little measurements

2219
01:26:37.758 --> 01:26:40.972
around your body and like (chittering).

2220
01:26:40.972 --> 01:26:44.384
Making marks and there's batches of scattered parchment

2221
01:26:44.384 --> 01:26:46.080
and scribbling with charcoal.

2222
01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:50.025
It's like a nightmare tailor experience.

2223
01:26:50.025 --> 01:26:52.647
Before they jaunt off for a second,

2224
01:26:52.647 --> 01:26:54.839
and you see them cutting and bolting straps

2225
01:26:54.839 --> 01:26:56.656
until eventually they come back with two

2226
01:26:56.656 --> 01:26:58.126
loosely human-shaped harnesses.

2227
01:26:58.126 --> 01:26:59.921
They'll work. They're not comfortable.

2228
01:26:59.921 --> 01:27:02.069
As they begin putting them on you,

2229
01:27:02.069 --> 01:27:05.537
it's... it's very unique.

2230
01:27:05.537 --> 01:27:07.296
TRAVIS: Yeah, breathe. There you go.

2231
01:27:07.296 --> 01:27:10.305
MATT: Like collar, chest harness.

2232
01:27:10.305 --> 01:27:12.788
Arms at front, cuffs.

2233
01:27:12.788 --> 01:27:14.254
TRAVIS: All right.

2234
01:27:14.254 --> 01:27:16.445
LIAM: Do we still get the moorbounders?

2235
01:27:16.445 --> 01:27:17.904
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course we do.

2236
01:27:17.904 --> 01:27:20.151
SAM: BDSM up in here.

2237
01:27:20.151 --> 01:27:21.585
MARISHA: Fuck off, Nott.

2238
01:27:21.585 --> 01:27:23.644
SAM: I'm going to zip your mouth shut!

2239
01:27:23.644 --> 01:27:24.477
MARISHA: (muffled) Oh, fuck you!

2240
01:27:24.477 --> 01:27:29.002
(laughter)

2241
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.927
MATT: Harnesses.

2242
01:27:31.927 --> 01:27:33.547
(laughter)

2243
01:27:33.547 --> 01:27:34.528
MATT: Oh man.

2244
01:27:34.528 --> 01:27:35.987
LIAM: Nott, fetch the gimp.

2245
01:27:35.987 --> 01:27:37.723
MATT: Oh boy, oh boy.

2246
01:27:37.723 --> 01:27:39.423
TRAVIS: Here's the 10 gold we owe you.

2247
01:27:39.423 --> 01:27:40.564
Appreciate you very much.

2248
01:27:40.564 --> 01:27:43.052
MATT: "'Course! Always appreciate your patronage.

2249
01:27:43.052 --> 01:27:44.892
"Keep coming back and spending money

2250
01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:47.708
"and making strange requests, we'll do what we can."

2251
01:27:47.708 --> 01:27:50.951
TRAVIS: Okay, will do, next time we are around.

2252
01:27:50.951 --> 01:27:52.738
MATT: "Yeah! (laughs)"

2253
01:27:52.738 --> 01:27:54.036
TRAVIS: All right, let's get outta here. We got to get back.

2254
01:27:54.036 --> 01:27:55.696
LAURA: Yarnball, come to Mama.

2255
01:27:55.696 --> 01:27:57.544
MATT: "All right, boys, open up the pen!"

2256
01:27:57.544 --> 01:28:02.525
They open the pen and immediately, (snarling).

2257
01:28:02.525 --> 01:28:03.358
SAM: Jesus Christ.

2258
01:28:03.358 --> 01:28:04.252
MATT: The beasts come out.

2259
01:28:04.252 --> 01:28:06.203
You're just like oh god!

2260
01:28:06.203 --> 01:28:08.693
The goblins take a second, they get the harnesses on them

2261
01:28:08.693 --> 01:28:10.335
like (snarling) fighting them off,

2262
01:28:10.335 --> 01:28:12.397
one of them spins off, (shouts)

2263
01:28:12.397 --> 01:28:13.592
and gets thrown the opposite side,

2264
01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:16.225
and eventually the ones who've bonded with them,

2265
01:28:16.225 --> 01:28:19.273
you guys manage to calm them down.

2266
01:28:19.273 --> 01:28:20.576
LIAM: <i>Halt.</i>

2267
01:28:20.576 --> 01:28:21.409
LAURA: Oh.

2268
01:28:22.338 --> 01:28:23.940
LIAM: <i>Kommen Sie mit.</i>

2269
01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:24.773
<i>Ja?</i>

2270
01:28:26.805 --> 01:28:28.033
And I walk out.

2271
01:28:28.033 --> 01:28:30.878
LAURA: Yeah, do that too. Halt, you,

2272
01:28:30.878 --> 01:28:33.417
and also here's a treat for you,

2273
01:28:33.417 --> 01:28:35.771
I got it downstairs and stuff. Here.

2274
01:28:35.771 --> 01:28:38.354
Here, don't bite my hand, okay.

2275
01:28:39.835 --> 01:28:44.502
MATT: Walks with you, and Caduceus walks up to his, "Hey.

2276
01:28:45.396 --> 01:28:46.472
"All right."

2277
01:28:46.472 --> 01:28:48.135
(laughter)

2278
01:28:48.135 --> 01:28:50.233
You guys just exit the facility.

2279
01:28:50.233 --> 01:28:52.472
I hope I'm doing him justice for you, Taliesin. (laughs)

2280
01:28:52.472 --> 01:28:53.588
TRAVIS: Pretty good.

2281
01:28:53.588 --> 01:28:56.335
MATT: You guys make your way with your moorbounders,

2282
01:28:56.335 --> 01:28:58.967
and, whereas previously, you were rather

2283
01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:02.584
inconspicuous in the street, that's changed,

2284
01:29:02.584 --> 01:29:06.391
because you have three massive beasts tethered behind you

2285
01:29:06.391 --> 01:29:09.984
as well as two humans, quite tethered, alongside you.

2286
01:29:09.984 --> 01:29:11.938
LAURA: I want to climb on the back of mine and ride it.

2287
01:29:11.938 --> 01:29:12.978
MATT: Okay, you get up on the back.

2288
01:29:12.978 --> 01:29:14.583
LIAM: She would've still been a tiefling,

2289
01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:17.877
and I specifically changed into Jester's twin.

2290
01:29:17.877 --> 01:29:22.152
So we're just BDSM monster people.

2291
01:29:22.152 --> 01:29:26.028
MARISHA: Eventually, I do feel like before we go up to them,

2292
01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:27.586
we should drop this.

2293
01:29:27.586 --> 01:29:29.484
So we're not having to keep it up.

2294
01:29:29.484 --> 01:29:31.199
LIAM: It was just to pick up our ride.

2295
01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.441
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2296
01:29:32.441 --> 01:29:34.128
MATT: The sun is setting now. You're hitting dusk.

2297
01:29:34.128 --> 01:29:35.295
TRAVIS: Moorbounder.

2298
01:29:37.065 --> 01:29:39.587
SAM: Slave, get on one of the moorbounders.

2299
01:29:39.587 --> 01:29:42.800
MARISHA: (groans)

2300
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.336
My feet are bound.

2301
01:29:44.336 --> 01:29:48.077
Yeah, Fjord, put me on the cat.

2302
01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:51.316
TRAVIS: I just push her off so she's in the mud

2303
01:29:51.316 --> 01:29:52.652
and got dragged a little bit.

2304
01:29:52.652 --> 01:29:54.730
Got to look like you've been in that thing for a while.

2305
01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:55.921
Come on, commit to the part.

2306
01:29:55.921 --> 01:29:58.523
MARISHA: This is like some Stanford Prison Experiment shit.

2307
01:29:58.523 --> 01:30:01.023
LAURA: I'm just unhooking your feet. That's stupid.

2308
01:30:01.023 --> 01:30:03.086
What's the point of having somebody working for you

2309
01:30:03.086 --> 01:30:04.454
who can't even walk, right?

2310
01:30:04.454 --> 01:30:05.287
MARISHA: Thank you, Jester.

2311
01:30:05.287 --> 01:30:06.120
LAURA: You're welcome.

2312
01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.540
Fjord, do you want to get on my moorbounder with me?

2313
01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.373
TRAVIS: Sure.

2314
01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:13.401
LAURA: You can ride in the back.

2315
01:30:13.401 --> 01:30:14.234
TRAVIS: Okay.

2316
01:30:15.372 --> 01:30:16.542
MATT: All right.

2317
01:30:16.542 --> 01:30:19.122
LIAM: I drop the magic and lean down onto the ground

2318
01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:22.037
and get some soil on my hands and I rub it down,

2319
01:30:22.037 --> 01:30:24.680
and then I clap it onto Beauregard's face

2320
01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.313
and smash her face around and make it filthy,

2321
01:30:27.313 --> 01:30:29.092
and then do the same to myself,

2322
01:30:29.092 --> 01:30:30.944
and then take three steps back very quickly.

2323
01:30:30.944 --> 01:30:34.209
MATT: All right, cool, and you do that, effectively filthy,

2324
01:30:34.209 --> 01:30:36.990
also realizing in hindsight, moments after,

2325
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:38.202
it's not just mud.

2326
01:30:38.202 --> 01:30:40.258
(groaning)

2327
01:30:40.258 --> 01:30:41.091
But it works.

2328
01:30:41.091 --> 01:30:42.091
TRAVIS: It's shit!

2329
01:30:43.316 --> 01:30:44.574
MATT: Not all of it.

2330
01:30:44.574 --> 01:30:47.057
It's a mixture of various things.

2331
01:30:47.057 --> 01:30:49.307
(laughter)

2332
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:56.285
MATT: As the seven of you-- well, Yasha just walks

2333
01:30:56.285 --> 01:31:00.396
alongside, but while the rest of the six of you are

2334
01:31:00.396 --> 01:31:04.435
up onto-- riding tandem, two per moorbounder,

2335
01:31:04.435 --> 01:31:08.453
making your way through the muddy streets of Asarius,

2336
01:31:08.453 --> 01:31:12.786
you slowly make your way as the dusk light of orange

2337
01:31:13.745 --> 01:31:16.078
through the clouds of the gray now transitioning

2338
01:31:16.078 --> 01:31:19.675
to the mild bright primaries of the sunset.

2339
01:31:19.675 --> 01:31:22.478
You see the Aurora Hold before you

2340
01:31:22.478 --> 01:31:24.291
and make your way towards it to wherever

2341
01:31:24.291 --> 01:31:25.571
the next step of your destiny awaits.

2342
01:31:25.571 --> 01:31:26.947
And we're going to take a break there.

2343
01:31:26.947 --> 01:31:28.076
TRAVIS: Ooh ooh.

2344
01:31:28.076 --> 01:31:30.326
MATT: Because it is 8:40.

2345
01:31:30.326 --> 01:31:32.589
MARISHA: Good work, negotiation crew.

2346
01:31:32.589 --> 01:31:34.534
Yes, good work.

2347
01:31:34.534 --> 01:31:35.680
MATT: So we have--

2348
01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.513
LIAM: That's nice.

2349
01:31:36.513 --> 01:31:37.346
MATT: Yeah.

2350
01:31:37.346 --> 01:31:38.551
We'll pick up on that here in just a minute.

2351
01:31:38.551 --> 01:31:40.269
In the meantime, we do have our giveaway this week

2352
01:31:40.269 --> 01:31:42.725
from our friends at Wyrmwood. It is not a dice tray

2353
01:31:42.725 --> 01:31:43.926
this week, actually.

2354
01:31:43.926 --> 01:31:45.276
LAURA: Oh, I love this thing!

2355
01:31:45.276 --> 01:31:47.302
MATT: You guys have seen their Kickstarter thing

2356
01:31:47.302 --> 01:31:48.771
they're putting out there. These are

2357
01:31:48.771 --> 01:31:52.633
their red oak tabletop tiles, which are these here.

2358
01:31:52.633 --> 01:31:54.957
They're a series of magnetic tiles that you can arrange

2359
01:31:54.957 --> 01:31:57.690
like next to each other as magnets on the table.

2360
01:31:57.690 --> 01:31:59.871
These are slots like, oh god.

2361
01:31:59.871 --> 01:32:03.072
This is like a spell slot counter, right there.

2362
01:32:03.072 --> 01:32:05.162
LAURA: And death saving throw.

2363
01:32:05.162 --> 01:32:07.210
MATT: Yeah, there's a death saving throw keeper.

2364
01:32:07.210 --> 01:32:08.927
There's a tiny dice roller there.

2365
01:32:08.927 --> 01:32:11.548
LAURA: There's one that's got a dice jail.

2366
01:32:11.548 --> 01:32:14.003
MATT: Wait, is this the dice jail here?

2367
01:32:14.003 --> 01:32:15.120
LAURA: Yes!

2368
01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:15.953
MATT: It's got a little dice jail for

2369
01:32:15.953 --> 01:32:16.786
if you piss off your dice.

2370
01:32:16.786 --> 01:32:18.400
LIAM: Put some together, put some together!

2371
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.628
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

2372
01:32:19.628 --> 01:32:21.749
I figured out how to do it the other day.

2373
01:32:21.749 --> 01:32:24.444
MATT: There you go, you assemble them magnetically.

2374
01:32:24.444 --> 01:32:26.553
TRAVIS: The center. Put them in the center.

2375
01:32:26.553 --> 01:32:28.011
SAM: We have a camera there?

2376
01:32:28.011 --> 01:32:28.942
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2377
01:32:28.942 --> 01:32:29.844
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

2378
01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:30.956
But wait, it's not--

2379
01:32:30.956 --> 01:32:32.161
MATT: See, and they snap together like that.

2380
01:32:32.161 --> 01:32:33.072
MARISHA: That's a coaster?

2381
01:32:33.072 --> 01:32:34.193
LAURA: Well no, that one's upside down.

2382
01:32:34.193 --> 01:32:35.400
That's for your spell cards.

2383
01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.649
MATT: More stuff in there. It's pretty awesome.

2384
01:32:37.649 --> 01:32:40.213
You can check out Wyrmwood's Kickstarter campaign

2385
01:32:40.213 --> 01:32:42.439
for these right now to pick up your own set.

2386
01:32:42.439 --> 01:32:45.628
The keyword for tonight is recovery.

2387
01:32:45.628 --> 01:32:48.685
You enter the word recovery once into the chat here.

2388
01:32:48.685 --> 01:32:50.928
More than once, you'll be disqualified,

2389
01:32:50.928 --> 01:32:54.231
but we'll have a winner when we come back here shortly.

2390
01:32:54.231 --> 01:32:56.037
See you guys in a little bit.

2391
01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:57.532

TRAVIS: What!?

2411
01:33:51.455 --> 01:33:52.788
Guys, we did it.

2412
01:33:53.831 --> 01:33:55.831
LAURA: We're at the airport. We're about to get on a plane

2413
01:33:55.831 --> 01:33:57.396
after Emerald City Comic Con.

2414
01:33:57.396 --> 01:33:58.785
TRAVIS: We got our carry ons still.

2415
01:33:58.785 --> 01:34:00.945
LAURA: And we just found out the news.

2416
01:34:00.945 --> 01:34:01.778
TRAVIS: We broke it.

2417
01:34:01.778 --> 01:34:05.108
$7.5 million for the animated Kickstarter.

2418
01:34:05.108 --> 01:34:07.069
LAURA: I can't believe you guys.

2419
01:34:07.069 --> 01:34:08.155
TRAVIS: What the heck?

2420
01:34:08.155 --> 01:34:09.713
That's amazing.

2421
01:34:09.713 --> 01:34:10.546
LAURA: (Vex voice) Darling.

2422
01:34:10.546 --> 01:34:12.808
TRAVIS: That means you've unlocked two more episodes

2423
01:34:12.808 --> 01:34:15.641
of the mysterious Briarwood arc.

2424
01:34:15.641 --> 01:34:16.596
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

2425
01:34:16.596 --> 01:34:20.094
TRAVIS: And unleashes the new Vox Machina guest one-shot.

2426
01:34:20.094 --> 01:34:21.302
We got Felicia Day.

2427
01:34:21.302 --> 01:34:22.252
LAURA: We got Will Friedle.

2428
01:34:22.252 --> 01:34:23.114
TRAVIS: Wil Wheaton.

2429
01:34:23.114 --> 01:34:24.545
LAURA: We got Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

2430
01:34:24.545 --> 01:34:25.378
TRAVIS: Patrick Rothfuss.

2431
01:34:25.378 --> 01:34:26.211
LAURA: What the what!

2432
01:34:26.211 --> 01:34:27.262
We have Patrick Rothfuss?

2433
01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:28.446
TRAVIS: We have Patrick Rothfuss.

2434
01:34:28.446 --> 01:34:29.279
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

2435
01:34:29.279 --> 01:34:30.484
TRAVIS: I mean, schedules still to be

2436
01:34:30.484 --> 01:34:31.723
determined, but they are all in,

2437
01:34:31.723 --> 01:34:33.319
and we are in, and that's so exciting.

2438
01:34:33.319 --> 01:34:36.974
The next stretch goal, which is even crazier to say,

2439
01:34:36.974 --> 01:34:39.484
which is our last one, is $8.8 million,

2440
01:34:39.484 --> 01:34:44.396
which would finish the first season of this animated series

2441
01:34:44.396 --> 01:34:46.499
and finish the Briarwood arc, and that would be

2442
01:34:46.499 --> 01:34:48.587
everything that we'd ever hoped for and more.

2443
01:34:48.587 --> 01:34:50.563
We don't know what to do after that.

2444
01:34:50.563 --> 01:34:52.782
Except make other stories,

2445
01:34:52.782 --> 01:34:54.181
but this is the start, this is the way

2446
01:34:54.181 --> 01:34:55.854
that we want to do it, and it's only because

2447
01:34:55.854 --> 01:34:57.735
of your generosity and your support

2448
01:34:57.735 --> 01:34:59.224
and your passion and love.

2449
01:34:59.224 --> 01:35:00.391
LAURA: We love you!

2450
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:04.931
TRAVIS: Okay, we got to get on a plane and

2451
01:35:04.931 --> 01:35:05.764
try to pretend to--

2452
01:35:05.764 --> 01:35:07.333
LAURA: Be normal, what?

2453
01:35:07.333 --> 01:35:10.428
TRAVIS: We love you so much, and please continue.

2454
01:35:10.428 --> 01:35:14.667
We'll see you on Tuesdays and and Thursdays going forward.

2455
01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:15.925
(kiss sounds) Bye.

2456
01:35:15.925 --> 01:35:17.858
TRAVIS (VO): Previously on MAME Drop.

2457
01:35:17.858 --> 01:35:20.054
WHITNEY: It's not a very effective way to deliver papers.

2458
01:35:20.054 --> 01:35:21.609
TALIESIN: It's your paper bag of shame.

2459
01:35:21.609 --> 01:35:24.338
See, non-customers have like spooky goth houses.

2460
01:35:24.338 --> 01:35:25.171
WHITNEY: Whoa.

2461
01:35:26.038 --> 01:35:27.600
TALIESIN: Then customers are super happy

2462
01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.583
and you have to shoot the paper.

2463
01:35:28.583 --> 01:35:30.197
WHITNEY: I want to be a non-customer.

2464
01:35:30.197 --> 01:35:32.827
Look at how cool, it's got a skull on the door.

2465
01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:35.132
TALIESIN: The non-customers have the best houses.

2466
01:35:35.132 --> 01:35:38.484
You just have to avoid everything, yeah, see?

2467
01:35:38.484 --> 01:35:40.578
Non-customers coming home in their hearse.

2468
01:35:40.578 --> 01:35:41.411
Oh my god.

2469
01:35:41.411 --> 01:35:42.556
WHITNEY: Is this consensual violence?

2470
01:35:42.556 --> 01:35:43.713
TALIESIN: This is, indeed, consensual violence.

2471
01:35:43.713 --> 01:35:47.821
I'm just like, he's like shooting things

2472
01:35:47.821 --> 01:35:49.085
out of a syringe at you.

2473
01:35:49.085 --> 01:35:51.644
WHITNEY: You look like an old professor.

2474
01:35:51.644 --> 01:35:52.477
TALIEISN: What?

2475
01:35:52.477 --> 01:35:54.794
WHITNEY: I look like a weird, what the fuck?

2476
01:35:54.794 --> 01:35:56.295
TALIESIN: Oh, you're in trouble now!

2477
01:35:56.295 --> 01:35:58.966
I am the reason the turtle dies.

2478
01:35:58.966 --> 01:36:00.164
WHITNEY: What?

2479
01:36:00.164 --> 01:36:02.643
TALIESIN: I don't know, I just keep hitting buttons.

2480
01:36:02.643 --> 01:36:03.476
(laughs)

2481
01:36:03.476 --> 01:36:04.309
WHITNEY: What the heck?

2482
01:36:04.309 --> 01:36:05.670
TALIESIN: What is happening?

2483
01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:06.778
Whoa.

2484
01:36:06.778 --> 01:36:08.058
WHITNEY: I think you got me.

2485
01:36:08.058 --> 01:36:08.974
TALIEISN: You should pick one of those.

2486
01:36:08.974 --> 01:36:09.924
WHITNEY: Oh, I get to place it?

2487
01:36:09.924 --> 01:36:10.984
Okay.

2488
01:36:10.984 --> 01:36:12.077
TALIESIN: That seems only fair.

2489
01:36:12.077 --> 01:36:13.188
WHITNEY: Well, I'm going to keep this going.

2490
01:36:13.188 --> 01:36:14.646
TALIESIN: All right, all right, I'm into it.

2491
01:36:14.646 --> 01:36:17.013
WHITNEY: Look at that cute cat.

2492
01:36:17.013 --> 01:36:19.058
TALIESIN: Nice.

2493
01:36:19.058 --> 01:36:22.581
WHITNEY: Thank you for the gift that you're about to bestow

2494
01:36:22.581 --> 01:36:26.227
upon me. I appreciate you. Thank you for letting me

2495
01:36:26.227 --> 01:36:31.227
be on your show, and I have your consent?

2496
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.269
Okay.

2497
01:36:32.269 --> 01:36:34.083
TALIESIN: I'm glad that you've now

2498
01:36:34.083 --> 01:36:35.864
put the prize machine in charge.

2499
01:36:35.864 --> 01:36:37.477
There's no going back anymore.

2500
01:36:37.477 --> 01:36:38.429
WHITNEY: Ooh!

2501
01:36:38.429 --> 01:36:39.682
TALIESIN: What did you get?

2502
01:36:39.682 --> 01:36:40.844
WHITNEY: Did I get a weapon?

2503
01:36:40.844 --> 01:36:41.679
TALIEISN: Maybe.

2504
01:36:41.679 --> 01:36:42.771
Oh my god!

2505
01:36:42.771 --> 01:36:44.597
Oh man, you are very lucky, okay.

2506
01:36:44.597 --> 01:36:46.512
WHITNEY: What is this, it's a little book.

2507
01:36:46.512 --> 01:36:47.781
TALIESIN: You got tiny props.

2508
01:36:47.781 --> 01:36:49.503
WHITNEY: I got a tiny, oh!

2509
01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:53.612
I got a little book of astronomy

2510
01:36:53.612 --> 01:36:56.511
and a telescope. Oh.

2511
01:36:56.511 --> 01:36:58.044
TALIESIN: Tiny telescope.

2512
01:36:58.044 --> 01:37:01.635
WHITNEY: I can see all the way to my house from here.

2513
01:37:01.635 --> 01:37:03.239
And I got a world map.

2514
01:37:03.239 --> 01:37:04.243
TALIEISN: And a world map.

2515
01:37:04.243 --> 01:37:05.522
WHITNEY: Oh my god, I love it.

2516
01:37:05.522 --> 01:37:06.757
MATT: "Well, hello there.

2517
01:37:06.757 --> 01:37:11.100
"I'm Pumat Sol, and I'm here to get you sold

MATT: "Oh, I'm in that."

2526
01:37:33.803 --> 01:37:35.705
MATT: "How about PUBG?"

2527
01:37:35.705 --> 01:37:37.471
MATT: "Oh, we're in that."

2528
01:37:37.471 --> 01:37:38.899
MATT: "League of Legends?"

2529
01:37:38.899 --> 01:37:40.972
MATT: "Oh yeah, you know we're in that."

2530
01:37:40.972 --> 01:37:43.505
MATT: "You can find a handy link to download

"Come on, come on, shoo, shoo, shoo.

2536
01:38:11.921 --> 01:38:14.582
TRAIVS (VO): Last time on Yee-haw Game Ranch.

2537
01:38:14.582 --> 01:38:17.348
MARISHA: "Howdy boys!"

2538
01:38:17.348 --> 01:38:18.198
BRIAN: What the hell?

2539
01:38:18.198 --> 01:38:22.427
MARISHA: "I can't thank you enough for giving me breath.

2540
01:38:22.427 --> 01:38:27.207
"What was the name you gave me to awaken my soul?"

2541
01:38:27.207 --> 01:38:30.000
BRIAN: It's the armadillo we named two weeks ago.

2542
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.972
It's Root N Toot N Ruby.

2543
01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:33.723
MARISHA: "Root N Toot N Ruby?

2544

01:38:39.531 --> 01:38:43.691
"There are other critters out here who need names."

2547

BRIAN: Oh yeah, we do have a bunch.

2548
01:38:44.994 --> 01:38:49.994
MARISHA: "Speak them, and they will return, just like me."

2549
01:38:50.315 --> 01:38:51.148
BRIAN: Wow.

2550
01:38:51.148 --> 01:38:52.703
MARISHA: "So dust off your boots and enjoy those

2551
01:38:52.703 --> 01:38:57.637
"games, boys. But remember the prophecy."

2552
01:38:57.637 --> 01:38:59.765
BRIAN: The what?
TRAVIS: Prophecy?

2553
01:38:59.765 --> 01:39:01.913
MARISHA: "The prophecy..."

2554
01:39:01.913 --> 01:39:04.413
TRAVIS: What are you doing with--

2555
01:39:04.413 --> 01:39:05.246
BRIAN: What the hell?

2556
01:39:05.246 --> 01:39:08.565
Brian: All right, Kimothy was raised in Venice.

2557
01:39:08.565 --> 01:39:12.164
Today's actually the first day he's ever left Venice.

2558
01:39:12.164 --> 01:39:14.164
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2559
01:39:14.164 --> 01:39:16.188
BRIAN: Sometimes he gets in trouble

2560
01:39:16.188 --> 01:39:17.230
because of the way he looks.

2561
01:39:19.630 --> 01:39:22.782
He's basically modeled after the drummer from Sevendust

2562
01:39:22.782 --> 01:39:23.882
which is a super deep cut.

2563
01:39:23.882 --> 01:39:24.890
TRAVIS: Yeah, I see it!

2564
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:26.845
BRIAN: For some of the fans out there.

2565
01:39:26.845 --> 01:39:29.486
But yeah, he killed both of his parents

2566
01:39:29.486 --> 01:39:31.669
a couple years ago and he's been on the run ever since then.

2567
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:34.908
He's allergic to cheese but he loves other dairy products.

2568
01:39:34.908 --> 01:39:36.188
(cow moos)

2569
01:39:36.188 --> 01:39:37.436
TRAVIS: One second.

2570
01:39:37.436 --> 01:39:39.942
BRIAN: That's Kimothy in a nutshell.

2571
01:39:39.942 --> 01:39:44.209
All right, up first... Hey! Hey, hold on.

2572
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:46.936
TRAVIS: I got a lot of flack for my Cheeto throwing,

2573
01:39:46.936 --> 01:39:50.672
or my cheese puff finger throwing.

2574
01:39:50.672 --> 01:39:52.602
I want you to know, I've been working on it.

2575
01:39:52.602 --> 01:39:53.786
One, a-two--

2576
01:39:53.786 --> 01:39:55.725
BRIAN: Wait, but these are bigger ones than last time.

2577
01:39:55.725 --> 01:39:57.308
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem.

2578
01:39:59.013 --> 01:40:00.713
BRIAN: That landed on my shoe.

2579
01:40:00.713 --> 01:40:01.971
TRAVIS: Oh, it did!

2580
01:40:01.971 --> 01:40:04.808
BRIAN: Dude, you don't know where my shoes have been.

2581
01:40:06.191 --> 01:40:08.608
TRAVIS: I'll throw it and catch it.

2582
01:40:09.637 --> 01:40:10.853
BRIAN: Where are you, sir?

2583
01:40:10.853 --> 01:40:12.178
TRAVIS: I'm just down here.

2584
01:40:12.178 --> 01:40:14.005
I'm right here.

2585
01:40:14.005 --> 01:40:18.991
(laughter)

2586
01:40:18.991 --> 01:40:23.991
(laughter)

2587
01:40:25.936 --> 01:40:26.911
TRAVIS: Pig-sooie!

2588
01:40:26.911 --> 01:40:27.744
(static)

2589
01:40:27.744 --> 01:40:29.149
(eerie music)

2590
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:31.274
(grunting)

2591
01:40:32.487 --> 01:40:34.133
MATT: "Oh! (chuckles)

2592
01:40:34.133 --> 01:40:36.536
"Would you look at that? I think it worked.

2593
01:40:36.536 --> 01:40:38.339
"You were right, Pumat Number Three.

01:40:38.339 --> 01:40:42.487

01:40:46.609 --> 01:40:48.077
"Oh boy.

"Well, hello there, I'm Pumat Prime.

"It's good to finally join you here in the Prime dimension.

"and oh, we're on the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

2601
01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:06.282
"Well, would you look at that, you got chat and everything.

2602
01:41:06.282 --> 01:41:07.736
"(chuckles)

2603
01:41:07.736 --> 01:41:10.507
"Respectfully, I was looking for the prime rib realm,

01:41:10.507 --> 01:41:12.916
"but this isn't too bad.

(dramatic music)

2624
01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.283
MATT: Welcome back, everyone.

2625
01:55:11.283 --> 01:55:14.437
So, we have, the winner of our fantastic giveaway

2626
01:55:14.437 --> 01:55:17.767
of the awesome tiles from our friends at Wyrmwood,

2627
01:55:17.767 --> 01:55:20.250
is FurryPhotos.

2628
01:55:20.250 --> 01:55:22.016
Congratulations, FurryPhotos.

2629
01:55:22.016 --> 01:55:26.504
You have won this awesome Wyrmwood Kickstarter giveaway.

2630
01:55:26.504 --> 01:55:28.938
We'll have that to you ASAP.

2631
01:55:28.938 --> 01:55:30.096
LAURA: I feel like I should put this in that jail

2632
01:55:30.096 --> 01:55:31.824
that is over there, but whatever.

2633
01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:33.148
MATT: I'll get it to you.

2634
01:55:33.148 --> 01:55:34.651
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to use it tonight.

2635
01:55:34.651 --> 01:55:35.913
MATT: There you go. That's for you.

2636
01:55:35.913 --> 01:55:37.040
TRAVIS: For now.

2637
01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.036
MATT: It belongs to FurryPhotos.

2638
01:55:39.036 --> 01:55:40.731
LAURA: Give me that jail.

2639
01:55:40.731 --> 01:55:42.148
MATT: All righty, so.

2640
01:55:44.513 --> 01:55:46.803
LAURA: Of course it's the bottom one.

2641
01:55:46.803 --> 01:55:48.412
MATT: Bringing us back in.

2642
01:55:48.412 --> 01:55:51.909
As you guys caravan your way through the streets

2643
01:55:51.909 --> 01:55:53.598
to the base of the Aurora Hold,

2644
01:55:53.598 --> 01:55:56.077
you make your way to the front stairs,

2645
01:55:56.077 --> 01:55:58.953
up through the front entryway, the doors that are open,

2646
01:55:58.953 --> 01:56:02.870
and the clerk there, immediately wide-eyed goes,

2647
01:56:03.936 --> 01:56:07.228
(stammering) "Excuse me, what's going on?"

2648
01:56:07.228 --> 01:56:11.602
TRAVIS: We have a meeting with Lady Olios.

2649
01:56:11.602 --> 01:56:13.138
SAM: Zethriss Olios.

2650
01:56:13.138 --> 01:56:15.303
These are our hoopdies.

2651
01:56:15.303 --> 01:56:19.602
MATT: "Are you bringing these creatures into the Hold?"

2652
01:56:19.602 --> 01:56:22.385
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, what do you mean the Hold?

2653
01:56:22.385 --> 01:56:23.517
MATT: "Are you waiting here?"

2654
01:56:23.517 --> 01:56:25.309
LAURA: She said to meet her here.

2655
01:56:25.309 --> 01:56:27.188
MATT: "I'll be right back."

2656
01:56:27.188 --> 01:56:29.402
The clerk darts off.

2657
01:56:29.402 --> 01:56:31.550
SAM: What is the Hold?

2658
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:34.169
MATT: The Hold is the structure you're in.

2659
01:56:34.169 --> 01:56:36.189
LAURA: Yeah, the Hold.

2660
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:41.064
MATT: A few moments pass before both Lady Zethriss Olios

2661
01:56:42.087 --> 01:56:46.087
and Lythir arrive out of the left-hand opening.

2662
01:56:47.433 --> 01:56:52.433
You see that the leisurely outfit that she had on earlier

2663
01:56:52.631 --> 01:56:56.930
is now gone, and there now is this longer, white--

2664
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:57.763
LAURA: Track suit.

2665
01:56:57.763 --> 01:56:59.493
MATT: Yeah, just track...

2666
01:56:59.493 --> 01:57:00.326
(laughter)

2667
01:57:00.326 --> 01:57:01.649
MATT: Just chains, everything.

2668
01:57:01.649 --> 01:57:02.638
(laughter)

2669
01:57:02.638 --> 01:57:04.516
MATT: She came back from yoga, guys.

2670
01:57:04.516 --> 01:57:07.210
(laughter)

2671
01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:11.139
MATT: No, this long, almost ceremonial dress,

2672
01:57:11.139 --> 01:57:14.951
with like white and silver,

2673
01:57:14.951 --> 01:57:18.768
a beautiful necklace of some dull gray stone

2674
01:57:18.768 --> 01:57:20.834
that when light hits it shines and shimmers.

2675
01:57:20.834 --> 01:57:22.514
It's very pretty.

2676
01:57:22.514 --> 01:57:26.988
Anyway, as you approach, she steps forward and goes,

2677
01:57:26.988 --> 01:57:31.597
"Very well, so have you acquired all of your friends?"

2678
01:57:31.597 --> 01:57:34.067
SAM: Yes, we're all here, yes.

2679
01:57:34.067 --> 01:57:38.967
MATT: Looks across Caduceus, Yasha, looks to the two of you.

2680
01:57:40.745 --> 01:57:42.714
TRAVIS: I apologize for any confusion.

2681
01:57:42.714 --> 01:57:44.366
These two work for us.

2682
01:57:44.366 --> 01:57:45.613
Hard workers, they're tough to find

2683
01:57:45.613 --> 01:57:49.543
in this day and age, but they do their jobs well.

2684
01:57:49.543 --> 01:57:50.710
MATT: "Interesting.

2685
01:57:51.856 --> 01:57:52.689
"All right.

2686
01:57:54.742 --> 01:57:59.127
"And your beasts, have you decided to bring them or not?"

2687
01:57:59.127 --> 01:58:00.822
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

2688
01:58:00.822 --> 01:58:02.798
LAURA: I mean, do you think it would be appropriate?

2689
01:58:02.798 --> 01:58:04.784
Here's the thing, we don't want to offend anyone,

2690
01:58:04.784 --> 01:58:07.550
but these guys were expensive, you know?

2691
01:58:11.234 --> 01:58:12.487
MATT: "We can try."

2692
01:58:12.487 --> 01:58:14.120
TRAVIS: How long is the voyage?

2693
01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.370
MATT: "Oh, not long."

2694
01:58:16.796 --> 01:58:20.859
LAURA: Are we teleporting or are we traveling?

2695
01:58:20.859 --> 01:58:25.672
MATT: "We are using a much faster means of traveling."

2696
01:58:25.672 --> 01:58:27.432
SAM: Do we need, would it make sense

2697
01:58:27.432 --> 01:58:30.020
to leave these guys behind, or should we,

2698
01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:33.973
I mean, can they fit, is it a thing where they have to fit?

2699
01:58:33.973 --> 01:58:38.973
MATT: She thinks for a second and goes, "We can try."

2700
01:58:39.293 --> 01:58:41.020
SAM: All right!

2701
01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:43.016
MATT: "All right, this way."

2702
01:58:43.016 --> 01:58:46.056
She turns around, the guards open the door

2703
01:58:46.056 --> 01:58:48.828
on the left-hand side, fully, and you guys see,

2704
01:58:48.828 --> 01:58:53.052
it's about five feet wide and about seven feet tall.

2705
01:58:53.052 --> 01:58:57.402
It is a comical experience squeezing

2706
01:58:57.402 --> 01:59:00.541
these moorbounders through. This is Winnie the Pooh

2707
01:59:00.541 --> 01:59:02.697
stuck in Rabbit's window, it's--

2708
01:59:02.697 --> 01:59:04.280
TRAVIS: Except they want to eat each other.

2709
01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:06.326
MATT: Yeah, it takes about six people each time

2710
01:59:06.326 --> 01:59:08.575
to push them through the doorway,

2711
01:59:08.575 --> 01:59:10.488
and in the process they're growling and snapping

2712
01:59:10.488 --> 01:59:12.740
at anyone that isn't you guys, and it's--

2713
01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:14.363
LIAM: (imitates cat yowling)

2714
01:59:14.363 --> 01:59:15.518
MATT: It is unique.

2715
01:59:15.518 --> 01:59:18.120
The folks that spend most of their days

2716
01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:20.357
walking the halls of the Aurora Hold

2717
01:59:20.357 --> 01:59:23.108
will probably tell of this tale for years to come.

2718
01:59:23.108 --> 01:59:25.296
LAURA: No pooping on the floor, you guys!

2719
01:59:25.296 --> 01:59:26.766
MATT: Too late, it's already happened twice.

2720
01:59:26.766 --> 01:59:28.506
(laughter)

2721
01:59:28.506 --> 01:59:30.451
MATT: On the smooth floor, too.

2722
01:59:30.451 --> 01:59:33.406
Just, you know, Jurassic Park level pile.

2723
01:59:33.406 --> 01:59:35.473
LAURA: Caleb, clean that up.

2724
01:59:35.473 --> 01:59:36.567
LIAM: I clean it up.

2725
01:59:36.567 --> 01:59:38.817
(laughter)

2726
01:59:39.699 --> 01:59:42.062
TRAVIS: What I said, motherfucker!

2727
01:59:42.062 --> 01:59:44.732
MATT: You do make your way down the hallway, which is--

2728
01:59:44.732 --> 01:59:46.081
LAURA: Oh, you took it.

2729
01:59:46.081 --> 01:59:46.914
SAM: Oh!

2730
01:59:49.199 --> 01:59:52.409
LIAM: "Cleaned poop for thief."

2731
01:59:52.409 --> 01:59:53.953
Got it.

2732
01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:55.778
MATT: All righty.

2733
01:59:55.778 --> 01:59:59.931
You are led down the hall past the office

2734
01:59:59.931 --> 02:00:03.940
where Lady Zethriss was originally meeting you

2735
02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:05.789
for your first and secondary meeting.

2736
02:00:05.789 --> 02:00:08.397
Continuing on, the hallway curves to the left

2737
02:00:08.397 --> 02:00:11.159
and then comes to a small circular chamber

2738
02:00:11.159 --> 02:00:12.915
where the other hall seems to curve

2739
02:00:12.915 --> 02:00:14.575
and enter from that side, so this building seems to have

2740
02:00:14.575 --> 02:00:17.219
two main halls. Where it meets in the center,

2741
02:00:17.219 --> 02:00:19.660
there is a doorway that heads back

2742
02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:21.460
towards the direction of the entrance

2743
02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:23.942
at the base of the Hold, and a spiral staircase

2744
02:00:23.942 --> 02:00:27.348
that leads up higher into the Hold's towers, it seems.

2745
02:00:27.348 --> 02:00:29.275
On the side that you're facing, there is

2746
02:00:29.275 --> 02:00:33.231
a fairly heavy-looking door. It's a double door.

2747
02:00:33.231 --> 02:00:38.182
You see a symbol of the

2748
02:00:39.412 --> 02:00:41.003
dodecahedron

2749
02:00:41.003 --> 02:00:43.678
is carved into this door, where it's divided in the center,

2750
02:00:43.678 --> 02:00:45.581
where the two sides are closed in,

2751
02:00:45.581 --> 02:00:47.797
and there on each door you can see

2752
02:00:47.797 --> 02:00:50.481
a heavy entrance where a key of some kind should go in.

2753
02:00:50.481 --> 02:00:52.379
Flanking each side of the door

2754
02:00:52.379 --> 02:00:54.597
is a heavily armed orcish guard.

2755
02:00:54.597 --> 02:00:56.162
One's orcish, one's half-orcish,

2756
02:00:56.162 --> 02:00:58.621
and they're both arms crossed, standing,

2757
02:00:58.621 --> 02:01:00.661
weapons at the ready, and as they approach

2758
02:01:00.661 --> 02:01:03.113
they give like a bow and respectful nod

2759
02:01:03.113 --> 02:01:04.976
towards Lady Zethriss, and as the rest of you

2760
02:01:04.976 --> 02:01:06.517
come around the corner into the chamber,

2761
02:01:06.517 --> 02:01:09.759
they all curiously look at each other

2762
02:01:09.759 --> 02:01:11.820
and this cluster fuck of a group

2763
02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:13.869
that's making its way towards the doorway.

2764
02:01:13.869 --> 02:01:18.044
One of them begins to pipe up and goes, "Lady,"

2765
02:01:18.044 --> 02:01:20.957
and she goes, "Ah, it's fine."

2766
02:01:20.957 --> 02:01:25.087
She reaches into a small satchel she keeps on her hip

2767
02:01:25.087 --> 02:01:27.830
and procures this beautiful intricate silver key

2768
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:31.003
that matches a little bit of the silver inlay

2769
02:01:31.003 --> 02:01:34.371
that's pressed into the designs along the frame of the door.

2770
02:01:34.371 --> 02:01:36.491
She presses into one side, it clicks

2771
02:01:36.491 --> 02:01:39.395
to the left of the door, (clicks),

2772
02:01:39.395 --> 02:01:42.321
one to the right, (clicks), and both doors shudder

2773
02:01:42.321 --> 02:01:44.964
as she turns the key until eventually

2774
02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:47.051
both the orcs reach out and grab the edges

2775
02:01:47.051 --> 02:01:49.283
and pull both sides open.

2776
02:01:49.283 --> 02:01:52.795
Beyond that you see a wide staircase,

2777
02:01:52.795 --> 02:01:56.640
about eight feet wide, that curves downward out of sight.

2778
02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:01.640
She continues down, as does Lythir. Do you guys follow?

2779
02:02:01.688 --> 02:02:02.672
SAM: Yes.

2780
02:02:02.672 --> 02:02:03.633
TRAVIS: We should.

2781
02:02:03.633 --> 02:02:04.700
LIAM: You look too cocky.

2782
02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:06.399
Uncross your arms. You look like you want to start a fight

2783
02:02:06.399 --> 02:02:08.315
or get it on with that woman. Just look meager.

2784
02:02:08.315 --> 02:02:09.948
MARISHA: I want to do all of the above.

2785
02:02:09.948 --> 02:02:11.243
(laughter)

2786
02:02:11.243 --> 02:02:13.835
LIAM: Inside thoughts, inside thoughts.

2787
02:02:13.835 --> 02:02:18.024
MATT: So, progressing down the spiral,

2788
02:02:18.024 --> 02:02:21.262
descends about 100 feet or so into the depths

2789
02:02:21.262 --> 02:02:22.661
beneath the Hold.

2790
02:02:22.661 --> 02:02:24.546
The temperature gets colder.

2791
02:02:24.546 --> 02:02:28.150
The air gets noticeably more damp.

2792
02:02:28.150 --> 02:02:32.382
Most of it is carved stone with just bits of earth

2793
02:02:32.382 --> 02:02:34.897
that are held back with strips of stone

2794
02:02:34.897 --> 02:02:37.052
that have been carved out of nearby marble

2795
02:02:37.052 --> 02:02:38.738
or placed in through some magical means.

2796
02:02:38.738 --> 02:02:40.683
It seems that they've been affixed magically

2797
02:02:40.683 --> 02:02:43.246
with this seamless and beautiful in its construction.

2798
02:02:43.246 --> 02:02:46.356
Imagine like a stone ribcage that marks the roof

2799
02:02:46.356 --> 02:02:50.240
as you go down, just an occasional stone

2800
02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:52.800
kind of archway bars that go over the top.

2801
02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.539
LIAM: Giger.

2802
02:02:54.539 --> 02:02:55.372
MATT: Ish.

2803
02:02:56.578 --> 02:02:59.693
Once you hit that 100 feet below, it levels out,

2804
02:02:59.693 --> 02:03:03.961
and you find yourself in what is a Y-shaped intersection

2805
02:03:03.961 --> 02:03:07.357
between three small diamond-shaped chambers,

2806
02:03:07.357 --> 02:03:09.747
each marked with a silver arch at the entryway.

2807
02:03:09.747 --> 02:03:12.994
Imagine the stairs stop and you're in this small room,

2808
02:03:12.994 --> 02:03:14.653
maybe 10 feet across. It's somewhat circular,

2809
02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:18.239
and on the right side there is a diamond-shaped chamber

2810
02:03:18.239 --> 02:03:20.396
that goes to one side, to your left

2811
02:03:20.396 --> 02:03:22.340
there's a diamond-shaped chamber that goes that way,

2812
02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:24.088
and then across the way there's a third chamber.

2813
02:03:24.088 --> 02:03:26.157
They're about 20 feet across, 10 feet wide,

2814
02:03:26.157 --> 02:03:29.058
where it's at its widest point, and there's an arch

2815
02:03:29.058 --> 02:03:31.948
that signifies the opening to each of these doors.

2816
02:03:31.948 --> 02:03:34.105
The floor of the chamber before you

2817
02:03:34.105 --> 02:03:38.805
has this interesting circle

2818
02:03:38.805 --> 02:03:41.442
of various symbols and carvings

2819
02:03:41.442 --> 02:03:44.527
that may have had molten silver poured into it

2820
02:03:44.527 --> 02:03:47.751
and then cooled to give it this

2821
02:03:47.751 --> 02:03:51.610
silver-embossed sigil on the floor.

2822
02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:56.906
You recognize it. It is similar, though unique,

2823
02:03:56.906 --> 02:03:58.526
to the symbol that you were shown

2824
02:03:58.526 --> 02:04:00.776
in the tower in Nicodranas.

2825
02:04:03.501 --> 02:04:06.479
As you one by one begin to squeeze your way through,

2826
02:04:06.479 --> 02:04:08.665
there's not enough room in this chamber

2827
02:04:08.665 --> 02:04:10.461
for all of you and the moorbounders,

2828
02:04:10.461 --> 02:04:13.372
so the drow step into the chamber

2829
02:04:13.372 --> 02:04:15.775
across from where the entrance is.

2830
02:04:15.775 --> 02:04:17.520
Essentially the point of the triangle

2831
02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.499
between the three chambers.

2832
02:04:19.499 --> 02:04:21.879
Within there, there was another subtle,

2833
02:04:21.879 --> 02:04:23.670
nowhere near as bright silver,

2834
02:04:23.670 --> 02:04:25.429
but a subtle carving on the ground,

2835
02:04:25.429 --> 02:04:27.278
similar size, about 10 foot wide,

2836
02:04:27.278 --> 02:04:32.255
this large, grooved-- not filled with silver,

2837
02:04:32.255 --> 02:04:35.022
but a carved groove of other sigils and symbols,

2838
02:04:35.022 --> 02:04:38.197
and it's some sort of an arcane...

2839
02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:41.522
like an arcane equation

2840
02:04:41.522 --> 02:04:44.365
that is built into this, for layer upon layer up on layer,

2841
02:04:44.365 --> 02:04:46.511
getting more intricate as it goes toward the center.

2842
02:04:46.511 --> 02:04:49.765
As you begin to head into that chamber,

2843
02:04:49.765 --> 02:04:52.016
Lady Zethriss, leading the troop,

2844
02:04:52.016 --> 02:04:55.960
turns around and goes, "I shall cross first.

2845
02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.062
"Grant me a pause for but a minute

2846
02:04:58.062 --> 02:05:00.669
"so I may notify of your coming.

2847
02:05:00.669 --> 02:05:02.219
"I think you prefer not to be eviscerated

2848
02:05:02.219 --> 02:05:03.991
upon arriving, yes?

2849
02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:05.067
TRAVIS: That would be preferred.

2850
02:05:05.067 --> 02:05:07.484
SAM: Not right upon arrival, no.

2851
02:05:09.784 --> 02:05:12.157
MATT: She turns and steps through.

2852
02:05:12.157 --> 02:05:14.165
You watch as she goes, steps on to the circle.

2853
02:05:14.165 --> 02:05:17.584
Her body just vanishes in the middle air,

2854
02:05:17.584 --> 02:05:19.663
like she just stepped through a curtain and doesn't exist.

2855
02:05:19.663 --> 02:05:20.496
LAURA: Wow.

2856
02:05:21.753 --> 02:05:23.912
TRAVIS: Caleb, start counting.

2857
02:05:23.912 --> 02:05:26.212
LIAM: One, two, three--

2858
02:05:26.212 --> 02:05:28.240
MATT: Lythir steps through.

2859
02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:29.407
Same scenario.

2860
02:05:30.294 --> 02:05:32.907
LAURA: Dang, I was going to ask him some questions.

2861
02:05:32.907 --> 02:05:34.077
Hey, you guys, now that we're down here

2862
02:05:34.077 --> 02:05:35.345
without anybody around us--

2863
02:05:35.345 --> 02:05:37.299
MATT: There are guards behind you.

2864
02:05:37.299 --> 02:05:41.611
The orcs that let you in are up in the stairway

2865
02:05:41.611 --> 02:05:43.666
kind of keeping a distance from the moorbounders

2866
02:05:43.666 --> 02:05:46.092
that right now are jammed in and squeezing,

2867
02:05:46.092 --> 02:05:48.240
like (snarling).

2868
02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.073
SAM: Jesus.

2869
02:05:49.073 --> 02:05:51.773
MATT: This is a very unique journey.

2870
02:05:51.773 --> 02:05:53.984
(laughter)

2871
02:05:53.984 --> 02:05:55.287
TRAVIS: Money well spent.

2872
02:05:55.287 --> 02:05:56.410
Has it been a minute?

2873
02:05:56.410 --> 02:05:58.614
MATT: Been about a minute.

2874
02:05:58.614 --> 02:05:59.528
LIAM: 58.

2875
02:05:59.528 --> 02:06:02.483
(laughter)

2876
02:06:02.483 --> 02:06:04.511
MATT: Who goes first?

2877
02:06:04.511 --> 02:06:05.565
TRAVIS: I'll go.

2878
02:06:05.565 --> 02:06:06.439
MATT: Okay.

2879
02:06:06.439 --> 02:06:07.992
SAM: Hope you don't get eviscerated.

2880
02:06:07.992 --> 02:06:10.442
MATT: (whooshes) Fjord vanishes through.

2881
02:06:11.586 --> 02:06:12.994
LAURA: Okay, I'll go next.
SAM: Okay.

2882
02:06:12.994 --> 02:06:13.827
LAURA: Then we should send--

2883
02:06:13.827 --> 02:06:14.660
SAM: The slaves?

2884
02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:16.734
LAURA: Yeah, and then you and Yasha.

2885
02:06:16.734 --> 02:06:18.092
SAM: Sure.

2886
02:06:18.092 --> 02:06:21.499
MATT: Jester, you step through. (whooshes)

2887
02:06:21.499 --> 02:06:22.844
SAM: All right.

2888
02:06:22.844 --> 02:06:23.677
LAURA: With my moorbounder, yeah?

2889
02:06:23.677 --> 02:06:24.843
SAM: You lot.

2890
02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:26.092
MATT: Bring your moorbounder behind you.

2891
02:06:26.092 --> 02:06:29.641
You watch as Jester vanishes but the tether remains, taut,

2892
02:06:29.641 --> 02:06:32.501
and at the edge of it you see this sparkle,

2893
02:06:32.501 --> 02:06:35.072
and it seems to almost like eat the tether

2894
02:06:35.072 --> 02:06:36.198
as the moorbounder moves forward,

2895
02:06:36.198 --> 02:06:38.433
and then eventually as it steps into the circle,

2896
02:06:38.433 --> 02:06:40.752
the moorbounder (whooshes) vanishes as well.

2897
02:06:40.752 --> 02:06:43.196
LIAM: I will take my moorbounder by the collar

2898
02:06:43.196 --> 02:06:45.029
and just walk forward.

2899
02:06:45.904 --> 02:06:47.796
(laughter)

2900
02:06:47.796 --> 02:06:49.704
MATT: (whooshes) You vanish as well.

2901
02:06:50.644 --> 02:06:52.892
Caduceus is there with his moorbounder like,

2902
02:06:52.892 --> 02:06:57.418
"Wow, that's pretty crazy."

2903
02:06:57.418 --> 02:06:59.725
(laughter)

2904
02:06:59.725 --> 02:07:01.084
MARISHA: I go.

2905
02:07:01.084 --> 02:07:01.917
MATT: All right.

2906
02:07:01.917 --> 02:07:03.275
He follows you, and you guys all step through,

2907
02:07:03.275 --> 02:07:04.945
Yasha following suit.

2908
02:07:04.945 --> 02:07:06.796
SAM: I'll take a big swig and go last.

2909
02:07:06.796 --> 02:07:08.529
MATT: All right.

2910
02:07:08.529 --> 02:07:10.325
Braving yourself, as Nott is wont to do,

2911
02:07:10.325 --> 02:07:13.234
you take a heavy swig and step forward and (whooshes).

2912
02:07:13.234 --> 02:07:14.102
SAM: Ah!

2913
02:07:14.102 --> 02:07:16.157
MATT: The sensation is cold at first.

2914
02:07:16.157 --> 02:07:18.487
The body chills in but an instant,

2915
02:07:18.487 --> 02:07:20.307
and it feels like you're being blasted

2916
02:07:20.307 --> 02:07:22.957
with a heavy blast of wind.

2917
02:07:22.957 --> 02:07:24.466
Like you just opened a door in the middle of a storm,

2918
02:07:24.466 --> 02:07:27.398
for an instant, and then it comes to rest again.

2919
02:07:27.398 --> 02:07:29.978
Your eyes lose focus for about a moment,

2920
02:07:29.978 --> 02:07:32.509
and then as they clarify once more.

2921
02:07:32.509 --> 02:07:35.142
The lighting has changed.

2922
02:07:35.142 --> 02:07:38.631
You now find yourselves in a chamber

2923
02:07:38.631 --> 02:07:41.284
very much like the one you just left.

2924
02:07:41.284 --> 02:07:43.408
Mirrored, though larger.

2925
02:07:43.408 --> 02:07:47.544
The circular center is now about 25 feet across,

2926
02:07:47.544 --> 02:07:49.623
and there's plenty of room for you and your moorbounders

2927
02:07:49.623 --> 02:07:53.013
to all squeeze into this space all together.

2928
02:07:53.013 --> 02:07:55.982
On the floor there is a similar symbol

2929
02:07:55.982 --> 02:07:58.035
to the silver inlaid symbol on the ground as well.

2930
02:07:58.035 --> 02:08:01.572
These are anchor sigils for teleportation circles.

2931
02:08:01.572 --> 02:08:02.579
LIAM: Fixed and carved, yeah?

2932
02:08:02.579 --> 02:08:03.579
MATT: Correct.

2933
02:08:03.579 --> 02:08:05.139
They're carved and then it looks like

2934
02:08:05.139 --> 02:08:07.699
they've had molten silver poured into them

2935
02:08:07.699 --> 02:08:09.313
so that when it cooled, it now has this

2936
02:08:09.313 --> 02:08:14.192
really cool looking silver inlay that matches the symbols.

2937
02:08:14.192 --> 02:08:17.242
LAURA: Does the silver do anything special,

2938
02:08:17.242 --> 02:08:18.860
or is it just pretty?

2939
02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:19.753
MATT: You don't know.

2940
02:08:19.753 --> 02:08:20.711
LAURA: I say it out loud.

2941
02:08:20.711 --> 02:08:23.235
MATT: You say it out loud.

2942
02:08:23.235 --> 02:08:28.235
Lythir turns to you and goes, "It does both.

2943
02:08:28.757 --> 02:08:32.340
"It aids the continuation of the enchantment

2944
02:08:33.250 --> 02:08:34.958
"and it is quite beautiful."

2945
02:08:34.958 --> 02:08:36.208
LAURA: It really is.

2946
02:08:38.482 --> 02:08:40.098
MATT: You see now six chambers affixed here

2947
02:08:40.098 --> 02:08:41.306
as opposed to three,

2948
02:08:41.306 --> 02:08:44.633
and there is one staircase that just continues upward.

2949
02:08:44.633 --> 02:08:46.436
Not a spiral as the one you came down

2950
02:08:46.436 --> 02:08:49.324
from the Aurora Hold, but one that continues up.

2951
02:08:49.324 --> 02:08:51.240
As you guys have all stepped through at this point,

2952
02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:54.494
Lady Zethriss turns to you, at the base of the stairs,

2953
02:08:54.494 --> 02:08:56.357
kind of ascended about three or four of them

2954
02:08:56.357 --> 02:08:58.020
before stopping and turning around and goes,

2955
02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:02.020
"Welcome to the underarches of the Lucid Bastion."

2956
02:09:05.277 --> 02:09:07.884
(laughter)

2957
02:09:07.884 --> 02:09:09.217
LAURA: Where is that?

2958
02:09:13.226 --> 02:09:17.563
MATT: "I have spoken on your behalf, and you will meet

2959
02:09:17.563 --> 02:09:20.407
"with the Bright Queen within an hour."

2960
02:09:20.407 --> 02:09:21.284
LAURA: Whoa.

2961
02:09:21.284 --> 02:09:23.807
MATT: "Your guard will escort you to the holding chambers

2962
02:09:23.807 --> 02:09:26.628
"until you are to be presented.

2963
02:09:26.628 --> 02:09:28.342
"Follow please."

2964
02:09:28.342 --> 02:09:30.525
She continues to ascend the stairs.

2965
02:09:30.525 --> 02:09:32.423
LAURA: Lady Zethriss?

2966
02:09:32.423 --> 02:09:33.862
MATT: She continues walking

2967
02:09:33.862 --> 02:09:35.631
but gives a hand motion for you to catch up.

2968
02:09:35.631 --> 02:09:37.018
LAURA: How often is it that the Bright Queen

2969
02:09:37.018 --> 02:09:39.253
actually sees people?

2970
02:09:39.253 --> 02:09:40.504
MATT: "Not very often.

2971
02:09:40.504 --> 02:09:43.348
"Usually at a favor to a member of the various dens.

2972
02:09:43.348 --> 02:09:45.931
"You have done me a favor, and as such,

2973
02:09:45.931 --> 02:09:49.014
"I have given you one in kind."

2974
02:09:49.977 --> 02:09:52.300
SAM: You're a den mother, then?

2975
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:55.971
MATT: "I am one of many figures and many dens,

2976
02:09:55.971 --> 02:09:59.440
"but I am one of the three most powerful in mine, yes."

2977
02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.319
SAM: Oh.

2978
02:10:00.319 --> 02:10:03.036
LAURA: I had a feeling you were really powerful.

2979
02:10:03.036 --> 02:10:04.610
MATT: "Thank you."

2980
02:10:04.610 --> 02:10:09.131
She continues to ascend, her formal dress

2981
02:10:09.131 --> 02:10:13.048
dragging behind her by about five or six steps.

2982
02:10:13.987 --> 02:10:16.286
There are guards waiting for you at the top.

2983
02:10:16.286 --> 02:10:19.644
It's about a 60-foot climb. It's not too extensive.

2984
02:10:20.661 --> 02:10:24.911
You make your way towards the top of the staircase.

2985
02:10:25.933 --> 02:10:27.600
It opens up into

2986
02:10:29.954 --> 02:10:33.588
this, how do I describe,

2987
02:10:34.982 --> 02:10:39.682
this beautiful, long hall

2988
02:10:40.844 --> 02:10:43.261
to the right and left of you.

2989
02:10:44.105 --> 02:10:46.438
You can see

2990
02:10:49.810 --> 02:10:52.210
like a semi-opaque gray quartz-like material

2991
02:10:52.210 --> 02:10:56.178
that the entirety of this hallway is carved from.

2992
02:10:56.178 --> 02:10:58.823
You can see the walls themselves reach up

2993
02:10:58.823 --> 02:11:02.401
probably 30 to 40 feet, and slowly come to

2994
02:11:02.401 --> 02:11:04.703
a heavy arched point at the top.

2995
02:11:04.703 --> 02:11:07.935
There are pillars about every 20 feet or so,

2996
02:11:07.935 --> 02:11:10.784
and this hall goes on for maybe 80 to 100 feet

2997
02:11:10.784 --> 02:11:12.307
in each direction.

2998
02:11:12.307 --> 02:11:15.152
You look past that. It goes on even further,

2999
02:11:15.152 --> 02:11:19.013
and further. This is probably a good 200, 300 feet

3000
02:11:19.013 --> 02:11:21.762
of hall in just this section here.

3001
02:11:21.762 --> 02:11:24.251
You can see where each one of these arches

3002
02:11:24.251 --> 02:11:26.734
and the pillars rise up and curve to meet the point.

3003
02:11:26.734 --> 02:11:29.153
There are sconces that are affixed there

3004
02:11:29.153 --> 02:11:31.177
where a simple white chain dangles

3005
02:11:31.177 --> 02:11:34.172
and holds onto these blue luminous orbs,

3006
02:11:34.172 --> 02:11:37.033
about that large, that just hang from them,

3007
02:11:37.033 --> 02:11:40.177
and give off this beautiful ethereal light

3008
02:11:40.177 --> 02:11:42.380
that fills the chamber, brighter than you expected.

3009
02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:46.519
This gives this entire hall with the somewhat

3010
02:11:46.519 --> 02:11:49.352
mostly opaque gray crystal a very,

3011
02:11:51.781 --> 02:11:53.999
almost a dreamlike quality.

3012
02:11:53.999 --> 02:11:55.978
It's beautiful and it's strange and it's different,

3013
02:11:55.978 --> 02:11:59.731
and you swear you can see moving shadows or shapes beyond,

3014
02:11:59.731 --> 02:12:01.936
but you're uncertain if there are things

3015
02:12:01.936 --> 02:12:03.275
actually beyond the chamber walls

3016
02:12:03.275 --> 02:12:04.795
or if it's just a trick of the light,

3017
02:12:04.795 --> 02:12:08.446
or you're just getting used to the interior.

3018
02:12:08.446 --> 02:12:11.448
As you move into the main hallway,

3019
02:12:11.448 --> 02:12:14.528
your moorbounders coming up behind you,

3020
02:12:14.528 --> 02:12:15.900
still growling and sniveling

3021
02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:18.525
and scraping the ground with their claws as they move.

3022
02:12:18.525 --> 02:12:20.775
(snorting)

3023
02:12:24.026 --> 02:12:29.026
You can see now, up ahead to the right side,

3024
02:12:29.582 --> 02:12:34.007
there are about a dozen or so drow guards

3025
02:12:35.136 --> 02:12:38.813
and about three orcish, or larger, creatures

3026
02:12:38.813 --> 02:12:43.115
in similar Kryn warrior armor, but it is made silver

3027
02:12:43.115 --> 02:12:44.272
and reflective.

3028
02:12:44.272 --> 02:12:46.389
More ornamental.

3029
02:12:46.389 --> 02:12:50.145
Beautiful and intimidating, and they step

3030
02:12:50.145 --> 02:12:53.015
carefully and intently to meet you

3031
02:12:53.015 --> 02:12:54.693
as you step to the right and head further

3032
02:12:54.693 --> 02:12:57.334
down that chamber following Lady Zethriss.

3033
02:12:58.767 --> 02:13:02.295
As you guys make it towards where these guards are,

3034
02:13:02.295 --> 02:13:05.574
Lady Zethriss turns to you, the clacking of your feet

3035
02:13:05.574 --> 02:13:06.979
across this empty hallway,

3036
02:13:06.979 --> 02:13:09.286
the quiet causing the sound of your footsteps

3037
02:13:09.286 --> 02:13:13.433
to echo in the silence, she spins around and goes,

3038
02:13:13.433 --> 02:13:16.600
"They will lead you to the antechamber.

3039
02:13:17.436 --> 02:13:19.791
"Prepare yourselves.

3040
02:13:19.791 --> 02:13:22.590
"Within an hour you will meet with the Bright Queen."

3041
02:13:23.523 --> 02:13:28.523
SAM: Is there any formal way to address her ladyship?

3042
02:13:30.907 --> 02:13:33.156
MATT: "Just the queen."

3043
02:13:33.156 --> 02:13:35.362
LAURA: Should we have some like, special clothes on

3044
02:13:35.362 --> 02:13:38.461
or maybe should we get cleaned up and stuff,

3045
02:13:38.461 --> 02:13:41.273
because you know, she's really important and stuff.

3046
02:13:41.273 --> 02:13:42.677
MATT: "You'll be fine."

3047
02:13:42.677 --> 02:13:45.918
TRAVIS: You mentioned you were one of three den mothers.

3048
02:13:45.918 --> 02:13:48.365
Forgive our ignorance, but would you mind telling us

3049
02:13:48.365 --> 02:13:50.264
about the other two?

3050
02:13:50.264 --> 02:13:51.654
MATT: "My sisters, you mean."

3051
02:13:51.654 --> 02:13:53.358
TRAVIS: Your sisters?

3052
02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:54.358
I'm unaware.

3053
02:13:56.733 --> 02:13:58.166
MATT: "Where are you from?"

3054
02:13:58.166 --> 02:13:58.999
SAM: Shit.

3055
02:13:59.929 --> 02:14:01.023
MARISHA: Every time.

3056
02:14:01.023 --> 02:14:02.108
TRAVIS: Every time.

3057
02:14:02.108 --> 02:14:03.657
LIAM: Poke, poke, poke, poke.

3058
02:14:03.657 --> 02:14:08.271
MATT: "I'm just curious, you all seem to find your way

3059
02:14:08.271 --> 02:14:10.929
"under the Dynasty's banner, but know so little

3060
02:14:10.929 --> 02:14:12.346
"of its structure."

3061
02:14:14.374 --> 02:14:17.033
TRAVIS: Well, we all sort of found each other by accident.

3062
02:14:17.033 --> 02:14:19.875
I was an outcast from the deep south,

3063
02:14:19.875 --> 02:14:24.125
made my way up north and then east, found this lot.

3064
02:14:26.811 --> 02:14:28.087
MATT: Make a Persuasion check.

3065
02:14:28.087 --> 02:14:29.920
Technically not lying.

3066
02:14:33.924 --> 02:14:34.757
TRAVIS: 23.

3067
02:14:39.656 --> 02:14:43.122
MATT: The tension remains, but she doesn't press further.

3068
02:14:43.122 --> 02:14:48.115
She goes, "Well, to inform you a bit,

3069
02:14:48.115 --> 02:14:51.948
"there are many dens that help run the Dynasty.

3070
02:14:54.952 --> 02:14:58.645
"Den Kryn, which you are about to meet,

3071
02:14:58.645 --> 02:15:02.935
"has been, since its inception, for the past near millennia,

3072
02:15:02.935 --> 02:15:04.935
"the heads of our people.

3073
02:15:07.173 --> 02:15:11.090
"Meet this with reverence, honesty, and respect.

3074
02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:17.459
"I take it none of you are consecuted, correct?"

3075
02:15:17.459 --> 02:15:22.209
SAM: We're, I haven't turned 13 yet, so I can't technically.

3076
02:15:24.698 --> 02:15:25.865
TRAVIS: That's a no.

3077
02:15:27.007 --> 02:15:28.858
MATT: "Then you have nothing to look forward to

3078
02:15:28.858 --> 02:15:30.941
"if this life were to end.

3079
02:15:32.785 --> 02:15:33.702
"Be careful."

3080
02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:36.649
SAM: Is there a way we could just quickly get consecrated

3081
02:15:36.649 --> 02:15:38.408
or whatever before--
LAURA: (whispered) Consecuted.

3082
02:15:38.408 --> 02:15:40.991
SAM: Yeah, before we meet her, or--?

3083
02:15:42.058 --> 02:15:46.429
MATT: "(chuckles) Show your faith, many years

3084
02:15:46.429 --> 02:15:49.596
"of service to the Dynasty, maybe then.

3085
02:15:50.493 --> 02:15:54.139
"But such things are not handed out to strangers."

3086
02:15:54.139 --> 02:15:56.083
LAURA: Yeah, no, obviously.

3087
02:15:56.083 --> 02:15:59.293
SAM: Of course, I just thought that maybe.

3088
02:15:59.293 --> 02:16:00.921
TRAVIS: Anything to avoid?

3089
02:16:00.921 --> 02:16:04.317
Any topics of conversation not to be spoken of

3090
02:16:04.317 --> 02:16:06.650
within the queen's presence?

3091
02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.588
MATT: "Stick to your business, answer her questions,

3092
02:16:11.588 --> 02:16:13.088
"ask of your favor.

3093
02:16:14.339 --> 02:16:16.696
"That should suffice."

3094
02:16:16.696 --> 02:16:17.696
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3095
02:16:18.856 --> 02:16:23.856
LAURA: We should probably put our babies

3096
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:25.901
in a holding area,

3097
02:16:25.901 --> 02:16:28.248
or should we bring them with us to see her?

3098
02:16:28.248 --> 02:16:31.055
MATT: "They will remain in your holding area.

3099
02:16:31.055 --> 02:16:33.351
"I am to believe," and she looks past the guards,

3100
02:16:33.351 --> 02:16:34.756
and makes a motion towards the moorbounders,

3101
02:16:34.756 --> 02:16:37.014
and you watch as a few of them step forward

3102
02:16:37.014 --> 02:16:39.931
and reach out to take your leashes,

3103
02:16:41.017 --> 02:16:42.839
your tethers of the beasts.

3104
02:16:42.839 --> 02:16:44.539
LAURA: Ooh, oh. Be careful.

3105
02:16:44.539 --> 02:16:47.538
MATT: The creatures (snarling).

3106
02:16:47.538 --> 02:16:49.251
As they approach, they carefully step forward

3107
02:16:49.251 --> 02:16:52.124
and look towards you and Caduceus and Caleb

3108
02:16:52.124 --> 02:16:54.498
for a moment of permission.

3109
02:16:55.365 --> 02:16:57.618
One by one, they gather them and--

3110
02:16:57.618 --> 02:17:02.526
LAURA: I give my orc guy an arm of the little creature

3111
02:17:02.526 --> 02:17:03.923
that I killed.

3112
02:17:03.923 --> 02:17:06.474
MATT: As you reach in, (squishing)

3113
02:17:06.474 --> 02:17:09.057
it is just tar, it is degraded.

3114
02:17:10.050 --> 02:17:13.020
LAURA: Here, just, I put the tar in his hand.

3115
02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:17.437
MATT: It seeps into all the metallic pieces of his armor.

3116
02:17:19.385 --> 02:17:22.455
LAURA: Yarnball really likes that. You can offer it to him.

3117
02:17:22.455 --> 02:17:24.557
MATT: You don't finish the phrase before your moorbounder

3118
02:17:24.557 --> 02:17:27.218
goes (snarling) and starts licking it out of them,

3119
02:17:27.218 --> 02:17:30.890
he's like (groaning).

3120
02:17:30.890 --> 02:17:31.941
LAURA: (laughs)

3121
02:17:31.941 --> 02:17:33.682
MATT: Yarnball's like (slurping), eyes bugging

3122
02:17:33.682 --> 02:17:34.515
out the sides.

3123
02:17:34.515 --> 02:17:37.220
(laughter)

3124
02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:38.053
MATT: (spitting)

3125
02:17:38.053 --> 02:17:39.389
And immediately coughs it up onto the ground.

3126
02:17:39.389 --> 02:17:40.222
LAURA: Aww.

3127
02:17:40.222 --> 02:17:42.472
(laughter)

3128
02:17:43.505 --> 02:17:46.439
MATT: The guards all look at each other

3129
02:17:46.439 --> 02:17:48.939
and collectively sigh.

3130
02:17:50.052 --> 02:17:53.016
LAURA: Yarnball's eyes don't blink at the same time.

3131
02:17:53.016 --> 02:17:54.223
(laughter)

3132
02:17:54.223 --> 02:17:57.603
MATT: Only one of them blinks, really.

3133
02:17:57.603 --> 02:17:59.848
At this point, Lady Zethriss goes,

3134
02:17:59.848 --> 02:18:02.748
"I believe at this point our debt is paid."

3135
02:18:02.748 --> 02:18:03.828
LAURA: Thank you.

3136
02:18:03.828 --> 02:18:04.828
MATT: "Thank you."

3137
02:18:06.402 --> 02:18:08.152
SAM: Yes, thank you very much for

3138
02:18:08.152 --> 02:18:10.393
your honorable transaction,

3139
02:18:10.393 --> 02:18:12.725
and if we find anything else out,

3140
02:18:12.725 --> 02:18:15.666
we'll come and tell you right away.

3141
02:18:15.666 --> 02:18:17.791
LAURA: Is Lythir going to come with us

3142
02:18:17.791 --> 02:18:19.466
or is he staying with you?

3143
02:18:19.466 --> 02:18:21.007
MATT: He's like right beside you, he says,

3144
02:18:21.007 --> 02:18:23.306
"No, I have business as well."

3145
02:18:23.306 --> 02:18:24.789
LAURA: Oh okay.

3146
02:18:24.789 --> 02:18:26.873
Cool, just checking.

3147
02:18:26.873 --> 02:18:29.970
TRAVIS: May the light be with you.

3148
02:18:29.970 --> 02:18:31.137
MATT: "You as well."

3149
02:18:32.577 --> 02:18:35.276
She turns and heads the opposite side of the hallway.

3150
02:18:35.276 --> 02:18:37.996
She's not returning to Asarius,

3151
02:18:37.996 --> 02:18:40.533
but she's handling business elsewhere.

3152
02:18:40.533 --> 02:18:44.276
The guards turn and begin to lead the moorbounders,

3153
02:18:44.276 --> 02:18:48.659
and yourselves, further down the large hall,

3154
02:18:48.659 --> 02:18:51.683
for about 150 feet or so, until you reach

3155
02:18:51.683 --> 02:18:54.266
what looks to be a double door.

3156
02:18:56.423 --> 02:19:00.590
Here you see, as it opens up into the antechamber,

3157
02:19:01.453 --> 02:19:03.417
the guards push into the inside,

3158
02:19:03.417 --> 02:19:05.383
it's a 20-foot across room flanked with

3159
02:19:05.383 --> 02:19:08.982
some black stone benches on each side.

3160
02:19:08.982 --> 02:19:10.975
You can see a small fountain of clear water

3161
02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:13.098
that's gently trickling out that's in

3162
02:19:13.098 --> 02:19:14.825
the center of the chamber. You can see

3163
02:19:14.825 --> 02:19:17.010
three metallic cups that are resting on the lip

3164
02:19:17.010 --> 02:19:19.573
on the outside of this fountain.

3165
02:19:19.573 --> 02:19:24.202
The guards tether the moorbounders to these heavy posts,

3166
02:19:24.202 --> 02:19:26.507
these metallic posts that sit in the corner,

3167
02:19:26.507 --> 02:19:30.424
that look like they hold up some sort of a vase

3168
02:19:31.299 --> 02:19:36.004
or some sort of a container made of clay or stone.

3169
02:19:36.004 --> 02:19:37.531
It's hard to make out the materials,

3170
02:19:37.531 --> 02:19:39.240
but they tether them to it and then

3171
02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.106
lead you inside the antechamber.

3172
02:19:42.106 --> 02:19:46.053
As you guys make your way in, they close the doors.

3173
02:19:46.053 --> 02:19:49.470
MARISHA: Can I get like a glance at the glasses?

3174
02:19:51.610 --> 02:19:53.239
TRAVIS: Yeah, the cups on the top?

3175
02:19:53.239 --> 02:19:54.843
MATT: Yeah, the cups are inside the room with you.

3176
02:19:54.843 --> 02:19:55.676
MARISHA: They're in the room.

3177
02:19:55.676 --> 02:19:57.758
MATT: Yeah, the antechamber is-- there's a set of benches

3178
02:19:57.758 --> 02:20:00.663
on each side, and there's the fountain in the center,

3179
02:20:00.663 --> 02:20:02.295
and there is a larger set of double doors

3180
02:20:02.295 --> 02:20:04.762
on the other end that are currently closed.

3181
02:20:04.762 --> 02:20:07.112
MARISHA: Do the cups just seem...

3182
02:20:07.112 --> 02:20:07.945
MATT: Make a Perception check.

3183
02:20:07.945 --> 02:20:11.232
MARISHA: Like water cups, presentery type of thing?

3184
02:20:12.847 --> 02:20:13.680
13.

3185
02:20:14.546 --> 02:20:17.339
MATT: They appear to be clean metallic cups.

3186
02:20:17.339 --> 02:20:19.623
They're are not huge. They're small.

3187
02:20:19.623 --> 02:20:21.376
TRAVIS: Just resting on the edge of the fountain?

3188
02:20:21.376 --> 02:20:23.553
MATT: Yeah, which only lifts about a foot and a half

3189
02:20:23.553 --> 02:20:25.266
off the ground, so you know, you could almost lean

3190
02:20:25.266 --> 02:20:26.870
and sit on it, uncomfortably, if you want to.

3191
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:29.596
TRAVIS: That needs to be picked up, come on.

3192
02:20:29.596 --> 02:20:33.375
LAURA: Do we see a symbol of the dodecahedron anywhere?

3193
02:20:33.375 --> 02:20:35.875
MATT: Make a Perception check.

3194
02:20:38.846 --> 02:20:40.004
LAURA: Oh, it keeps doing that.

3195
02:20:40.004 --> 02:20:43.129
SAM: Yeah, it does a lot of things.

3196
02:20:43.129 --> 02:20:44.796
LAURA: Eight.

3197
02:20:44.796 --> 02:20:46.357
MATT: Eight. No, you don't see anything like that.

3198
02:20:46.357 --> 02:20:48.877
There isn't a lot of iconography in here.

3199
02:20:48.877 --> 02:20:51.228
You do notice, and getting a closer look at the material

3200
02:20:51.228 --> 02:20:55.422
of this-- whatever this structure is made from,

3201
02:20:55.422 --> 02:20:59.222
this beautiful gray quartz,

3202
02:21:01.863 --> 02:21:03.994
getting close to it, you can see,

3203
02:21:03.994 --> 02:21:05.910
because it's mostly opaque, but there's

3204
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:07.348
some sort of translucence to it.

3205
02:21:07.348 --> 02:21:10.335
You can see layers and shapes and interesting things in it,

3206
02:21:10.335 --> 02:21:12.114
and on the inside, you can see

3207
02:21:12.114 --> 02:21:15.813
veins of silver almost. It looks like maybe

3208
02:21:15.813 --> 02:21:19.849
a few inches inside, imagine blanched white silver

3209
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:22.467
tree branches that just extend upward

3210
02:21:22.467 --> 02:21:25.045
like veins and capillaries that eventually dissipate

3211
02:21:25.045 --> 02:21:26.180
amongst the rest of the stone.

3212
02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:27.013
TRAVIS: It's still, it's--

3213
02:21:27.013 --> 02:21:28.459
MATT: It's still, it's not moving.

3214
02:21:28.459 --> 02:21:29.709
It's beautiful.

3215
02:21:30.722 --> 02:21:35.150
It gives everything in here like a natural feel,

3216
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:37.087
even though it is hewn material.

3217
02:21:37.087 --> 02:21:38.773
But very pretty.

3218
02:21:38.773 --> 02:21:41.092
Above the fountain there is another one of those blue orbs

3219
02:21:41.092 --> 02:21:42.736
that is dangling from a white chain

3220
02:21:42.736 --> 02:21:47.562
that is giving this nice cool glow to the interior.

3221
02:21:47.562 --> 02:21:49.412
Temperature's comfortable, if like slightly chilly,

3222
02:21:49.412 --> 02:21:51.138
but comfortable.

3223
02:21:51.138 --> 02:21:52.943
TRAVIS: What's coming out of the fountain?

3224
02:21:52.943 --> 02:21:54.205
Just water as far as we can see?

3225
02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:56.540
MATT: Clear-- just fuckin' blood everywhere.

3226
02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:58.046
(laughter)

3227
02:21:58.046 --> 02:21:59.797
MATT: Perfectly clear water, it looks like.

3228
02:21:59.797 --> 02:22:02.488
You hear the faint trickle. (water noises)

3229
02:22:02.488 --> 02:22:04.362
LAURA: Oh man, I never did pee.

3230
02:22:04.362 --> 02:22:05.595
SAM: Oh no.

3231
02:22:06.562 --> 02:22:08.867
TRAVIS: I'll go over and pick up one of the cups.

3232
02:22:08.867 --> 02:22:11.268
MATT: Okay, it's light, light weight.

3233
02:22:11.268 --> 02:22:12.933
LIAM: Are we alone at this point?

3234
02:22:12.933 --> 02:22:15.026
MATT: It is only your party.

3235
02:22:15.026 --> 02:22:17.136
Just you guys, Caduceus, and Yasha.

3236
02:22:17.136 --> 02:22:19.645
You are sealed in the chamber and you assume you have

3237
02:22:19.645 --> 02:22:21.060
under an hour.

3238
02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:23.152
TRAVIS: Definitely ours to use, right?

3239
02:22:23.152 --> 02:22:25.637
MARISHA: Oh, this is the waiting chamber.

3240
02:22:25.637 --> 02:22:26.845
MATT: You gather this is the waiting chamber.

3241
02:22:26.845 --> 02:22:28.111
SAM: Do you think they're watching us?

3242
02:22:28.111 --> 02:22:30.344
LAURA: Let's look around the walls

3243
02:22:30.344 --> 02:22:32.360
and see if there's any like, looks like peepholes

3244
02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:36.319
or anywhere people are looking in, or maybe through that,

3245
02:22:36.319 --> 02:22:40.050
I wonder if they're looking at us through that glowy thing.

3246
02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:42.042
TRAVIS: I scoop the cup through the fountain.

3247
02:22:42.042 --> 02:22:43.848
MARISHA: I do the same thing.

3248
02:22:43.848 --> 02:22:45.360
TRAVIS: Cheers.
MARISHA: Cheers.

3249
02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:48.126
MARISHA: Maybe it's the fountain of youth.

3250
02:22:48.126 --> 02:22:51.504
TRAVIS: Do you actually drink that shit.

3251
02:22:51.504 --> 02:22:53.216
MATT: So Beau, I need you to make, no, I'm kidding.

3252
02:22:53.216 --> 02:22:56.477
It's very crisp, very clean, cool water.

3253
02:22:56.477 --> 02:22:57.771
It's actually some of the best water you've had

3254
02:22:57.771 --> 02:22:59.164
in a long time, you've been--

3255
02:22:59.164 --> 02:23:02.491
MARISHA: Oh, I've been in Asarius for so long, oh.

3256
02:23:02.491 --> 02:23:04.157
TRAVIS: (sighs)

3257
02:23:04.157 --> 02:23:05.379
MARISHA: That's good.

3258
02:23:05.379 --> 02:23:06.546
TRAVIS: Really nice.

3259
02:23:07.396 --> 02:23:10.223
Anybody else want to whet your (whistles) whistle?

3260
02:23:10.223 --> 02:23:12.448
MATT: (as Caduceus) "I mean, yeah, that sounds

3261
02:23:12.448 --> 02:23:13.364
"like a great idea."

3262
02:23:13.364 --> 02:23:14.612
(laughter)

3263
02:23:14.612 --> 02:23:16.284
MATT: Takes the cup and scoops it in.

3264
02:23:16.284 --> 02:23:17.117
MARISHA: I'm going to look around.

3265
02:23:17.117 --> 02:23:17.950
TRAVIS: Probably going to tell the truth

3266
02:23:17.950 --> 02:23:18.831
when we get in there.

3267
02:23:18.831 --> 02:23:19.822
LAURA: Cheers.

3268
02:23:19.822 --> 02:23:20.838
MATT: "Cheers."

3269
02:23:20.838 --> 02:23:22.013
MARISHA: I'm going to look for any like--

3270
02:23:22.013 --> 02:23:23.128
MATT: Puts some tea leaves in it.

3271
02:23:23.128 --> 02:23:24.498
Kinda lets it steep for a little bit.

3272
02:23:24.498 --> 02:23:25.928
TRAVIS: (chuckling)

3273
02:23:25.928 --> 02:23:29.069
MARISHA: Any writing on the wall, any marks, anything--

3274
02:23:29.069 --> 02:23:30.285
MATT: Make an Investigation check.

3275
02:23:34.305 --> 02:23:35.841
MARISHA: (groans)

3276
02:23:35.841 --> 02:23:37.220
Gross.

3277
02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:38.273
11.

3278
02:23:38.273 --> 02:23:39.195
MATT: 11.

3279
02:23:39.195 --> 02:23:41.135
You run the perimeter a couple of times,

3280
02:23:41.135 --> 02:23:43.065
and you don't see any writing.

3281
02:23:43.065 --> 02:23:47.102
There's nothing in particular about this chamber

3282
02:23:47.102 --> 02:23:49.111
and its design beyond the fact that it's functional

3283
02:23:49.111 --> 02:23:50.852
and beautiful in its simplicity.

3284
02:23:50.852 --> 02:23:54.821
Most of the detail is within the actual stone itself,

3285
02:23:54.821 --> 02:23:59.597
and that is-- it's beautiful.

3286
02:23:59.597 --> 02:24:01.264
It's ancient.

3287
02:24:01.264 --> 02:24:04.355
It's hard to really grasp how it was made.

3288
02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:10.856
It, yeah, it gives off a very calming air

3289
02:24:10.856 --> 02:24:12.287
to the interior.

3290
02:24:12.287 --> 02:24:13.120
MARISHA: Okay.

3291
02:24:14.777 --> 02:24:16.768
SAM: I guess we wait

3292
02:24:16.768 --> 02:24:17.601
LAURA: Yeah.

3293
02:24:17.601 --> 02:24:20.478
MARISHA: What are we going to say to this, I mean--

3294
02:24:20.478 --> 02:24:23.137
SAM: The truth, we're going to say the truth.

3295
02:24:23.137 --> 02:24:25.404
LAURA: We're obviously just going to talk about the truth.

3296
02:24:25.404 --> 02:24:29.165
SAM: About how we're looking for the scientist gentleman--

3297
02:24:29.165 --> 02:24:30.640
LAURA: Can I sit down on the bench?

3298
02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.610
SAM: Because he can help cure our employers, right?

3299
02:24:34.610 --> 02:24:35.731
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

3300
02:24:35.731 --> 02:24:38.295
LAURA: I'm going to take one of my brushes

3301
02:24:38.295 --> 02:24:41.294
and on the underside of the bench I'm going to--

3302
02:24:41.294 --> 02:24:42.708
SAM: Where do we come from?

3303
02:24:42.708 --> 02:24:43.866
I feel like they keep asking us where we come from.

3304
02:24:43.866 --> 02:24:45.146
LAURA: --draw a symbol of the Traveler.

3305
02:24:46.596 --> 02:24:47.960
MATT: Go ahead and make a Sleight of Hand check, please.

3306
02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:51.627
SAM: Oh boy, are you going to graffiti this place?

3307
02:24:53.985 --> 02:24:55.072
LAURA: 16.

3308
02:24:55.072 --> 02:24:56.447
MATT: 16, okay.

3309
02:24:56.447 --> 02:25:00.030
You deftly stretch for about three minutes,

3310
02:25:03.581 --> 02:25:05.204
and feel pretty confident.

3311
02:25:05.204 --> 02:25:06.925
Now is this regular ink or is this magical?

3312
02:25:06.925 --> 02:25:07.758
LAURA: This is just regular ink.

3313
02:25:07.758 --> 02:25:08.704
MATT: Okay.

3314
02:25:08.704 --> 02:25:09.537
TRAVIS: Xhorhas.

3315
02:25:09.537 --> 02:25:10.990
MARISHA: I know, but where in Xhorhas?

3316
02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:13.032
Ashkeeper Peaks? Where's-- Yasha.

3317
02:25:13.032 --> 02:25:15.160
SAM: Where you from?

3318
02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:18.160
MATT: "I'm from south of the Sorrow Seep."

3319
02:25:19.114 --> 02:25:20.774
SAM: The what, Sorrow Seep?

3320
02:25:20.774 --> 02:25:23.299
MATT: "Yeah, in the Iothia Moorlands."

3321
02:25:23.299 --> 02:25:26.327
TRAVIS: Yeah, basically not on this map-ands.

3322
02:25:26.327 --> 02:25:27.859
MARISAH: Do we want to be from there?

3323
02:25:27.859 --> 02:25:29.716
TRAVIS: Why don't we say we're like from Bladegarden

3324
02:25:29.716 --> 02:25:32.665
and we came over through the Ashguard Garrison.

3325
02:25:32.665 --> 02:25:34.949
Because we weren't welcome no more.

3326
02:25:36.324 --> 02:25:37.765
Too much?

3327
02:25:37.765 --> 02:25:39.537
LIAM: I certainly hope that they are not watching

3328
02:25:39.537 --> 02:25:44.520
us right now. Because you have shat the bed if they are.

3329
02:25:45.718 --> 02:25:47.189
TRAVIS: What do you think?

3330
02:25:47.189 --> 02:25:49.439
(laughter)

3331
02:25:50.664 --> 02:25:52.634
LAURA: I think we should tell the truth,

3332
02:25:52.634 --> 02:25:54.396
that we are pirates, y'all.

3333
02:25:54.396 --> 02:25:56.123
SAM: We are pirates.

3334
02:25:56.123 --> 02:25:57.892
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

3335
02:25:57.892 --> 02:25:59.589
SAM: We're from the sea.

3336
02:25:59.589 --> 02:26:01.481
LAURA: I know pirates are frowned upon and stuff,

3337
02:26:01.481 --> 02:26:05.945
but that's the truth, and we grew up on the sea, you know?

3338
02:26:05.945 --> 02:26:08.612
We shouldn't be ashamed of that.

3339
02:26:09.579 --> 02:26:13.272
TRAVIS: Exiled from, the hell was it called?

3340
02:26:13.272 --> 02:26:14.885
In one day.

3341
02:26:14.885 --> 02:26:16.609
LAURA: Darktow.

3342
02:26:16.609 --> 02:26:17.875
TRAVIS: Darktow.

3343
02:26:19.389 --> 02:26:21.052
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm all right with that.

3344
02:26:21.052 --> 02:26:24.060
LIAM: We are exiles in every sense of the word.

3345
02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:26.585
MARISHA: I don't think that Caleb and I

3346
02:26:26.585 --> 02:26:28.541
will probably do much talking.

3347
02:26:28.541 --> 02:26:29.847
LAURA: Right.

3348
02:26:29.847 --> 02:26:31.287
SAM: Okay.

3349
02:26:31.287 --> 02:26:35.370
MARISHA: But, it might be weird to have your

3350
02:26:36.266 --> 02:26:39.908
servants, slaves, whatever you want to call us in the room.

3351
02:26:39.908 --> 02:26:42.038
Should we have a little bit more of an explanation there?

3352
02:26:42.038 --> 02:26:44.461
LAURA: Maybe when you come in, you both just like,

3353
02:26:44.461 --> 02:26:46.914
bow down and get down on all hands and knees

3354
02:26:46.914 --> 02:26:48.301
and look down at the ground.

3355
02:26:48.301 --> 02:26:50.170
SAM: Ooh, you could hold the cups for us.

3356
02:26:50.170 --> 02:26:52.054
Why don't you hold the cups for us?

3357
02:26:52.054 --> 02:26:52.887
MARISHA: I was thinking more like

3358
02:26:52.887 --> 02:26:54.336
I'm your personal bodyguard.

3359
02:26:54.336 --> 02:26:55.360
SAM: Oh!

3360
02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:56.913
LAURA: What if you sit down on your hands and knees

3361
02:26:56.913 --> 02:26:59.625
and then we sit on you like you're our personal like stool.

3362
02:26:59.625 --> 02:27:01.180
TRAVIS: Yeah, like benches.

3363
02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:03.249
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like you come around with us

3364
02:27:03.249 --> 02:27:05.011
and give us like, you know.

3365
02:27:05.011 --> 02:27:09.292
LIAM: We are very expensive benches that you hire.

3366
02:27:09.292 --> 02:27:10.507
LAURA: Very powerful bench.

3367
02:27:10.507 --> 02:27:12.247
TRAVIS: Among other things, but yeah.

3368
02:27:12.247 --> 02:27:13.196
LIAM: I've always thought that about you, Caleb.

3369
02:27:13.196 --> 02:27:14.488
TRAVIS: Real important job description.

3370
02:27:14.488 --> 02:27:16.129
MARISHA: I wish I had a bench to throw

3371
02:27:16.129 --> 02:27:16.962
at all of you all's heads.

3372
02:27:16.962 --> 02:27:17.795
LAURA: There is a bench.

3373
02:27:17.795 --> 02:27:18.928
There's a couple black benches in here.

3374
02:27:18.928 --> 02:27:22.095
MARISHA: They seem very bolted to the ground.

3375
02:27:24.390 --> 02:27:27.890
LIAM: How, how did I get here with you people?

3376
02:27:29.337 --> 02:27:31.182
(laughter)

3377
02:27:31.182 --> 02:27:32.181
LIAM: How?

3378
02:27:32.181 --> 02:27:33.734
SAM: We take you to all the best places.

3379
02:27:33.734 --> 02:27:35.801
We're about to meet a queen, yo.

3380
02:27:35.801 --> 02:27:36.634
This is amazing.

3381
02:27:36.634 --> 02:27:37.467
LAURA: It is.

3382
02:27:37.467 --> 02:27:40.863
SAM: We were on a boat a couple days ago it feels like.

3383
02:27:40.863 --> 02:27:42.790
LAURA: She's like really famous and stuff!

3384
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:43.852
SAM: Yeah.

3385
02:27:43.852 --> 02:27:46.136
MATT: (as Caduceus) "I'm actually pretty excited."

3386
02:27:46.136 --> 02:27:46.969
LAURA: See?

3387
02:27:46.969 --> 02:27:47.802
MATT: "I've never met a queen."

3388
02:27:47.802 --> 02:27:49.552
LAURA: No.
MATT: "No."

3389
02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:52.508
MARISHA: Like a little Elvis, like just a little.

3390
02:27:52.508 --> 02:27:53.686
(laughter)

3391
02:27:53.686 --> 02:27:54.640
MATT: To be fair, yeah.

3392
02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:56.248
TRAVIS: Any coins on the bottom of the fountain?

3393
02:27:56.248 --> 02:27:58.157
LIAM: (like Elvis) Thank you, Wildmother, thank you.

3394
02:27:58.157 --> 02:28:00.258
(laughter)

3395
02:28:00.258 --> 02:28:01.492
MATT: The DM will remember that.

3396
02:28:01.492 --> 02:28:02.325
(laughter)

3397
02:28:02.325 --> 02:28:03.926
MATT: No.

3398
02:28:03.926 --> 02:28:04.759
What was your question?

3399
02:28:04.759 --> 02:28:06.200
TRAVIS: Any coins at the bottom of the fountain?

3400
02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:07.770
Anything tossed in for good luck?

3401
02:28:07.770 --> 02:28:09.937
MATT: Make a Perception check.

3402
02:28:11.133 --> 02:28:12.488
TRAVIS: Hey!

3403
02:28:12.488 --> 02:28:13.321
20.

3404
02:28:13.321 --> 02:28:15.074
MATT: 20, no coins. It is clear.

3405
02:28:15.074 --> 02:28:20.074
It is a perfectly clean-- there is no algae.

3406
02:28:20.561 --> 02:28:22.692
It is just clean water.

3407
02:28:22.692 --> 02:28:26.260
SAM: I'm going to look for peepholes, or spy holes.

3408
02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:27.342
LAURA: Yeah, I said that a while ago.

3409
02:28:27.342 --> 02:28:28.343
SAM: Oh, you did?

3410
02:28:28.343 --> 02:28:29.687
LAURA: Yeah, but I never rolled an Investigation.

3411
02:28:29.687 --> 02:28:32.415
MATT: Sorry, go ahead and either of you or both of you

3412
02:28:32.415 --> 02:28:34.326
roll an Investigation checks, or one of you with advantage,

3413
02:28:34.326 --> 02:28:35.931
if you want.

3414
02:28:37.356 --> 02:28:38.189
LAURA: (groans)

3415
02:28:38.189 --> 02:28:39.022
SAM: 20.

3416
02:28:39.022 --> 02:28:40.032
LAURA: Okay, that's better than me.

3417
02:28:40.032 --> 02:28:40.876
MATT: 20.

3418
02:28:40.876 --> 02:28:41.709
Okay.

3419
02:28:41.709 --> 02:28:43.819
You glance around the chamber, you spend the next

3420
02:28:43.819 --> 02:28:46.792
15 or so minutes carefully scanning

3421
02:28:46.792 --> 02:28:51.206
the ceiling and the walls and the floor where it meets.

3422
02:28:51.206 --> 02:28:52.289
No peepholes.

3423
02:28:53.918 --> 02:28:57.093
About that time, the doors where you entered open.

3424
02:28:57.093 --> 02:28:58.899
You've been here about 40 minutes or so.

3425
02:28:58.899 --> 02:29:02.018
There doors where you came through open,

3426
02:29:02.018 --> 02:29:04.758
and Lythir steps in as well.

3427
02:29:04.758 --> 02:29:06.471
TRAVIS: Hey, welcome back.

3428
02:29:06.471 --> 02:29:07.888
MATT: "Yes, of course."

3429
02:29:09.414 --> 02:29:10.247
Anyway.

3430
02:29:10.247 --> 02:29:12.384
He comes in and the door closes behind him.

3431
02:29:12.384 --> 02:29:14.853
The guards are still waiting there on the outside,

3432
02:29:14.853 --> 02:29:17.811
and he just stands, finds one of the nearby benches,

3433
02:29:17.811 --> 02:29:20.998
and stands next to it, doesn't even sit,

3434
02:29:20.998 --> 02:29:22.897
but just quietly keeps watch.

3435
02:29:22.897 --> 02:29:25.325
TRAVIS: Unusual traveling partners, I know.

3436
02:29:25.325 --> 02:29:28.364
What are you here to talk to the Bright Queen about?

3437
02:29:28.364 --> 02:29:31.668
MATT: "That is my business, but it seemed convenient

3438
02:29:31.668 --> 02:29:35.414
"to affix my wagon to yours in this travel.

3439
02:29:35.414 --> 02:29:37.408
"I was already in the middle of discussing business

3440
02:29:37.408 --> 02:29:41.591
"with Lady Zethriss, so here we are.

3441
02:29:41.591 --> 02:29:42.657
"Strange bedfellows, yes?"

3442
02:29:42.657 --> 02:29:46.630
LAURA: How crazy is it that there was a fucking rift

3443
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:48.797
to the Abyssal plane, huh?

3444
02:29:50.156 --> 02:29:53.564
MATT: "I will admit that was unexpected.

3445
02:29:53.564 --> 02:29:58.480
"Such magics are not commonly found

3446
02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:00.063
"or even seen these days.

3447
02:30:00.063 --> 02:30:05.063
"That is an ancient construct, but not. I'm confused by it."

3448
02:30:05.592 --> 02:30:08.129
LAURA: Not-- what do you mean it wasn't ancient?

3449
02:30:08.129 --> 02:30:12.932
MATT: "Meaning the materials were more recently cobbled."

3450
02:30:12.932 --> 02:30:13.932
LAURA: Oh really?

3451
02:30:15.010 --> 02:30:18.537
Do you think somebody built it within the city?

3452
02:30:18.537 --> 02:30:19.764
MATT: "I don't know if it was in the city,

3453
02:30:19.764 --> 02:30:21.987
"but it's been within this age at the very least."

3454
02:30:21.987 --> 02:30:22.988
LAURA: Whoa.

3455
02:30:22.988 --> 02:30:27.988
MATT: "Weeks, months, (sighs) the shape and design of it

3456
02:30:28.011 --> 02:30:30.994
"seems to have seen little wear and tear."

3457
02:30:30.994 --> 02:30:33.258
LAURA: Yeah, it did seem pretty new.

3458
02:30:33.258 --> 02:30:36.313
TRAVIS: These happenings, are they limited to

3459
02:30:36.313 --> 02:30:37.929
the City of Beasts, or has it been happening

3460
02:30:37.929 --> 02:30:40.172
all over the Dynasty?

3461
02:30:40.172 --> 02:30:41.197
MATT: "I do not know.

3462
02:30:41.197 --> 02:30:44.828
"I have not been privy to such discussions, so."

3463
02:30:44.828 --> 02:30:47.134
SAM: But you might be seeing more of the Dynasty soon

3464
02:30:47.134 --> 02:30:50.301
after you get transferred away, right?

3465
02:30:51.543 --> 02:30:52.376
MATT: "Maybe."

3466
02:30:53.602 --> 02:30:55.071
SAM: Don't like the City of Beasts that much.

3467
02:30:55.071 --> 02:30:58.089
Too many beasts, not enough beasts?

3468
02:30:58.089 --> 02:31:01.522
MATT: "It lacks some of the more...

3469
02:31:03.137 --> 02:31:05.709
"gentle comforts of life."

3470
02:31:05.709 --> 02:31:07.287
SAM: Sure.

3471
02:31:07.287 --> 02:31:09.475
LAURA: Where are you from?

3472
02:31:09.475 --> 02:31:12.323
MATT: "I believe we've asked enough questions of myself.

3473
02:31:12.323 --> 02:31:14.079
"Where are you from?"

3474
02:31:14.079 --> 02:31:15.895
LAURA: I believe we've asked enough questions

3475
02:31:15.895 --> 02:31:17.120
of myself, too.

3476
02:31:18.136 --> 02:31:22.136
MATT: He narrows his eyes very intently towards you.

3477
02:31:23.205 --> 02:31:25.563
LAURA: Have you ever tried baked goods with

3478
02:31:25.563 --> 02:31:26.854
cinnamon in them?

3479
02:31:30.047 --> 02:31:31.311
MATT: "Why do you ask?"

3480
02:31:31.311 --> 02:31:32.451
LAURA: Because they're really good.

3481
02:31:32.451 --> 02:31:33.958
(laughter)

3482
02:31:33.958 --> 02:31:35.041
MATT: "I have not."

3483
02:31:36.118 --> 02:31:38.094
LAURA: You should try it.

3484
02:31:38.094 --> 02:31:39.173
MATT: "Good to know.

3485
02:31:39.173 --> 02:31:41.963
"I will keep this in mind next time I have the option

3486
02:31:41.963 --> 02:31:44.741
"of enjoying this cinnamon."

3487
02:31:44.741 --> 02:31:46.991
(laughter)

3488
02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:49.627
SAM: It's one of the top ten foods.

3489
02:31:49.627 --> 02:31:51.202
It's really good for you.

3490
02:31:51.202 --> 02:31:52.643
LAURA: Yeah, it's supposed to be really good

3491
02:31:52.643 --> 02:31:53.476
for your health.

3492
02:31:53.476 --> 02:31:55.489
Yeah, it's good.

3493
02:31:57.309 --> 02:32:00.594
MATT: "You keep your pets close by?"

3494
02:32:00.594 --> 02:32:03.111
TRAVIS: Yes, they serve a variety of functions.

3495
02:32:03.111 --> 02:32:06.135
They have actually very sharp memories.

3496
02:32:06.135 --> 02:32:09.726
Watch, I can say 13-44-16. What I say?

3497
02:32:09.726 --> 02:32:12.488
MARISHA: 13-44-16.
LIAM: A very old date.

3498
02:32:12.488 --> 02:32:14.954
LAURA: Beau-- they also make really excellent--

3499
02:32:14.954 --> 02:32:16.434
Beau, come here.

3500
02:32:16.434 --> 02:32:18.622
Be my foot stool.

3501
02:32:18.622 --> 02:32:20.704
SAM: We're doing that. We're doing that thing?

3502
02:32:20.704 --> 02:32:22.912
LAURA: I'm sitting on the bench already, so I just

3503
02:32:22.912 --> 02:32:25.991
lift up my feet and wait for her to get down there.

3504
02:32:25.991 --> 02:32:27.216
MARISHA: I bend down and I say,

3505
02:32:27.216 --> 02:32:29.016
I'm going to fuckin' get you outside.

3506
02:32:29.016 --> 02:32:31.174
MATT: "That is a very interesting punishment

3507
02:32:31.174 --> 02:32:32.457
"for imperial dogs."

3508
02:32:33.403 --> 02:32:36.475
TRAVIS: It's not so much a punishment as it is

3509
02:32:36.475 --> 02:32:39.609
an honor for them. Caleb, why don't you come over here

3510
02:32:39.609 --> 02:32:41.556
and make sure my boots are looking clean

3511
02:32:41.556 --> 02:32:43.531
for the Bright Queen, will ya?

3512
02:32:43.531 --> 02:32:47.923
LIAM: I take a very filthy rag out of my pocket

3513
02:32:47.923 --> 02:32:50.030
and I start to buff his shoe.

3514
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:53.110
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right.

3515
02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:55.559
SAM: (laughs) This is awful.

3516
02:32:55.559 --> 02:32:58.386
MATT: Lythir actually lets out a chuckle watching this.

3517
02:32:58.386 --> 02:33:01.002
He goes "(chuckling)

3518
02:33:01.002 --> 02:33:03.470
"Well, you've certainly learned how to pass the time."

3519
02:33:03.470 --> 02:33:04.903
LIAM: I've had this dream.

3520
02:33:04.903 --> 02:33:07.153
(laughter)

3521
02:33:08.862 --> 02:33:11.369
MATT: At this point, you hear some footsteps approaching

3522
02:33:11.369 --> 02:33:13.276
from the other larger doors.

3523
02:33:13.276 --> 02:33:15.664
LAURA: You can get up. You can get up.

3524
02:33:15.664 --> 02:33:16.556
(laughter)

3525
02:33:16.556 --> 02:33:17.760
SAM: Get up, you dogs.

3526
02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:20.233
(laughter)

3527
02:33:20.233 --> 02:33:21.733
TRAVIS: Get up you dogs.

3528
02:33:24.281 --> 02:33:28.364
MATT: Caduceus and Yasha look very uncomfortable.

3529
02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:31.878
(imitates thump)

3530
02:33:31.878 --> 02:33:35.457
With a resounding thoom, the heavy stone doors

3531
02:33:35.457 --> 02:33:37.306
begin to grind against the floor

3532
02:33:37.306 --> 02:33:40.056
leading further into the bastion.

3533
02:33:41.004 --> 02:33:43.973
A bright white light warms you

3534
02:33:43.973 --> 02:33:48.794
as you step into the colossal cathedral-like throne room.

3535
02:33:48.794 --> 02:33:52.155
The octagonal chamber is made of the same

3536
02:33:52.155 --> 02:33:55.028
semi-opaque gray stone maybe 120 feet,

3537
02:33:55.028 --> 02:33:57.540
150 feet across from you.

3538
02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:01.371
It rises to a gradual point, like an inverse pyramid

3539
02:34:01.371 --> 02:34:02.871
from the interior.

3540
02:34:03.945 --> 02:34:07.445
With harsh edges and elongated jagged ridges

3541
02:34:07.445 --> 02:34:11.583
that cut upward along the surface like climbing ice.

3542
02:34:11.583 --> 02:34:14.883
You see roughly 12 armored figures,

3543
02:34:14.883 --> 02:34:17.067
similar to the silvered warriors of the hallway previously,

3544
02:34:17.067 --> 02:34:18.900
vigilant at two exits.

3545
02:34:20.106 --> 02:34:23.414
The doors where you entered and a pair of doors

3546
02:34:23.414 --> 02:34:25.461
at an angle to your left.

3547
02:34:25.461 --> 02:34:28.827
The rest of the chamber is enclosed.

3548
02:34:28.827 --> 02:34:33.752
At the peak of the room, where the point is at its highest,

3549
02:34:33.752 --> 02:34:37.169
probably the elongated pyramid shape of this chamber,

3550
02:34:37.169 --> 02:34:40.362
about 200 feet above the center,

3551
02:34:40.362 --> 02:34:44.195
you see a circular sphere about 10 feet across

3552
02:34:46.062 --> 02:34:49.882
suspended by heavy white chains,

3553
02:34:49.882 --> 02:34:53.365
and it is emanating a bright white light,

3554
02:34:53.365 --> 02:34:56.699
like a small captured star, illuminating the chamber

3555
02:34:56.699 --> 02:34:59.910
like it was the brightest moonlight you've ever seen,

3556
02:34:59.910 --> 02:35:02.531
the purest, whitest moonlight.

3557
02:35:02.531 --> 02:35:05.323
Now the actual room before you

3558
02:35:05.323 --> 02:35:08.964
you can see gathers and rises up into a

3559
02:35:08.964 --> 02:35:12.130
small, lifted dias,

3560
02:35:12.130 --> 02:35:16.526
and then on that there are three more elevated platforms

3561
02:35:16.526 --> 02:35:18.418
with staircases that lead up to the center

3562
02:35:18.418 --> 02:35:20.942
and ones on the sides that curve up to the edges.

3563
02:35:20.942 --> 02:35:23.572
On top of that, above the platforms

3564
02:35:23.572 --> 02:35:27.397
as the guards begin to lead you closer to it still.

3565
02:35:27.397 --> 02:35:31.250
You can see there are two side platforms

3566
02:35:31.250 --> 02:35:33.762
that raise up with gentle stairs

3567
02:35:33.762 --> 02:35:36.136
on top of this central raised area,

3568
02:35:36.136 --> 02:35:40.010
and on each of these side bits there are four chairs,

3569
02:35:40.010 --> 02:35:43.075
four on this side, four on this side.

3570
02:35:43.075 --> 02:35:45.949
Seated within them you see a menagerie of figures,

3571
02:35:45.949 --> 02:35:49.351
mostly drow, but you see an orc,

3572
02:35:49.351 --> 02:35:53.144
you see a bugbear in robes on the opposite right side.

3573
02:35:53.144 --> 02:35:56.073
They're all mid-conversation in hushed whispers.

3574
02:35:56.073 --> 02:35:58.908
You cannot make out their talking at this distance

3575
02:35:58.908 --> 02:36:02.816
but you can see that there is some commotion and discussion.

3576
02:36:02.816 --> 02:36:07.668
The third raised platform raises higher than the other two,

3577
02:36:07.668 --> 02:36:11.154
and has one heavy wide staircase that ascends up to the top

3578
02:36:11.154 --> 02:36:14.637
where you see five chairs of differing sizes.

3579
02:36:14.637 --> 02:36:19.249
In the center, one massive, bright white crystal throne

3580
02:36:19.249 --> 02:36:23.832
that rises 13 or so feet from its base.

3581
02:36:24.872 --> 02:36:27.771
Between where all those chairs are arranged

3582
02:36:27.771 --> 02:36:29.399
in a semi-circle towards the stair,

3583
02:36:29.399 --> 02:36:31.251
you see in the middle

3584
02:36:31.251 --> 02:36:36.066
a short pillar, maybe three, four feet off the ground,

3585
02:36:36.066 --> 02:36:40.316
and atop it, a bright platinum wire frame construct

3586
02:36:41.781 --> 02:36:43.281
of a dodecahedron.

3587
02:36:46.522 --> 02:36:50.149
All the individuals around as you ascend the staircases

3588
02:36:50.149 --> 02:36:52.419
towards the center of this area,

3589
02:36:52.419 --> 02:36:55.794
all the conversation stops and comes to a halt

3590
02:36:55.794 --> 02:37:00.794
as all faces (whooshes) shift (whooshes) to you.

3591
02:37:04.241 --> 02:37:07.784
Atop the highest platform, immediately across from you

3592
02:37:07.784 --> 02:37:11.177
as you step up the large staircase

3593
02:37:11.177 --> 02:37:13.499
and walk towards the middle of these two rows

3594
02:37:13.499 --> 02:37:17.867
of raised chairs, the eyes watching as you pass.

3595
02:37:17.867 --> 02:37:22.284
You see five figures sitting among the chairs at top,

3596
02:37:23.139 --> 02:37:25.889
and in the center, in the throne,

3597
02:37:27.775 --> 02:37:30.025
you see a beautiful figure.

3598
02:37:30.882 --> 02:37:34.913
A voice rings out, sourceless around you.

3599
02:37:34.913 --> 02:37:38.329
"Visitors, you bear witness to

3600
02:37:38.329 --> 02:37:40.379
"the Bright Queen Leylas Kryn."

3601
02:37:41.776 --> 02:37:44.452
The woman in this throne stands

3602
02:37:44.452 --> 02:37:48.927
in a sparkling warrior dress of crystals and mithril chain.

3603
02:37:48.927 --> 02:37:51.586
Her beautiful dark gray blue skin

3604
02:37:51.586 --> 02:37:53.821
peaking from beneath the vibrant glow

3605
02:37:53.821 --> 02:37:56.575
of glittering beads and armor plates.

3606
02:37:56.575 --> 02:37:59.092
Her white hair topples from under a headdress

3607
02:37:59.092 --> 02:38:03.175
of three white crystal ibex-like horns that curve

3608
02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:06.061
to the back.

3609
02:38:06.061 --> 02:38:09.324
Past her shoulders the hair meets her waist from behind.

3610
02:38:09.324 --> 02:38:12.792
Her piercing turquoise eyes look down at you

3611
02:38:12.792 --> 02:38:14.875
from above a stern smile.

3612
02:38:16.772 --> 02:38:21.557
She steps up, lording right over where the dodecahedron is,

3613
02:38:21.557 --> 02:38:23.577
coming no closer as you are all led to stop

3614
02:38:23.577 --> 02:38:27.530
kind of between these three raised platforms.

3615
02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:30.407
The bright light ahead casting shadows

3616
02:38:30.407 --> 02:38:34.453
directly around where your ankles and feet are.

3617
02:38:34.453 --> 02:38:37.910
The voice once more ominous and around you says,

3618
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:40.243
"May she warm your weariness."

3619
02:38:45.050 --> 02:38:48.061
She lifts a staff you can see that goes about

3620
02:38:48.061 --> 02:38:50.301
a foot and a half beyond her height,

3621
02:38:50.301 --> 02:38:53.460
itself solid white marble that fades to gray

3622
02:38:53.460 --> 02:38:57.060
and at the top. It seems to arrive into

3623
02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:59.675
four clawed fingers that wrap around

3624
02:38:59.675 --> 02:39:03.258
an even smaller symbol of the dodecahedron.

3625
02:39:07.325 --> 02:39:10.383
"Welcome, children of light."

3626
02:39:12.809 --> 02:39:14.476
SAM: Light be with you.

3627
02:39:15.966 --> 02:39:20.966
MATT: "Lady Zethriss of Den Olios speaks of a deed done

3628
02:39:21.394 --> 02:39:26.369
"in the protection of Asarius, and discoveries most foul.

3629
02:39:29.568 --> 02:39:32.568
"I ask you to tell me of these deeds."

3630
02:39:36.067 --> 02:39:37.221
LAURA: Well.

3631
02:39:37.221 --> 02:39:42.039
SAM: Yes, our queen, empress of light, it is lovely to

3632
02:39:42.039 --> 02:39:44.760
take audience with you. Thank you for your time

3633
02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:46.158
and your graciousness.

3634
02:39:46.158 --> 02:39:48.991
We are the members of the Mighty Nein.

3635
02:39:48.991 --> 02:39:50.097
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3636
02:39:50.097 --> 02:39:53.597
SAM: A group of adventurers and investigators

3637
02:39:54.642 --> 02:39:59.564
who have recently helped your Lady...

3638
02:39:59.564 --> 02:40:00.397
LAURA: Olios.

3639
02:40:00.397 --> 02:40:01.230
SAM: Olios, thank you.

3640
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:03.278
LAURA: Yes, they were having an issue

3641
02:40:03.278 --> 02:40:05.571
because a lot of like fiends and monsters

3642
02:40:05.571 --> 02:40:08.271
were coming out into the city and also

3643
02:40:08.271 --> 02:40:10.633
some people were being like mind-controlled

3644
02:40:10.633 --> 02:40:14.279
and they were acting very weird and stuff,

3645
02:40:14.279 --> 02:40:17.893
so we, you know, took care of that.

3646
02:40:17.893 --> 02:40:20.960
TRAVIS: We found a happening under the soil,

3647
02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:24.430
and there was creatures from the Abyssal plane.

3648
02:40:24.430 --> 02:40:27.073
We fought, destroyed, and managed to

3649
02:40:27.073 --> 02:40:29.369
shut a rift to that dimension.

3650
02:40:29.369 --> 02:40:32.852
We recovered an artifact which we brought to Lady Olios.

3651
02:40:32.852 --> 02:40:35.163
SAM: We only apologize that it took us

3652
02:40:35.163 --> 02:40:37.911
an entire day to solve this problem.

3653
02:40:37.911 --> 02:40:40.140
LAURA: Yes, we had to wait until the dead of night,

3654
02:40:40.140 --> 02:40:43.234
when one of the citizens of the town

3655
02:40:43.234 --> 02:40:46.675
was being molested by

3656
02:40:47.784 --> 02:40:49.925
evil mind-controlling succubuses

3657
02:40:49.925 --> 02:40:52.354
and incubuses. (aside) That's what they're called.

3658
02:40:52.354 --> 02:40:53.555
SAM: I think it's, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

3659
02:40:53.555 --> 02:40:54.728
SAM: One's a boy and one's a girl.

3660
02:40:54.728 --> 02:40:59.228
LAURA: Yeah, and they, yeah, they were making him visualize

3661
02:41:00.075 --> 02:41:02.829
like really sexy bugbears, like--

3662
02:41:02.829 --> 02:41:04.437
SAM: We don't need to get into the details,

3663
02:41:04.437 --> 02:41:09.271
but it was devastating for your people

3664
02:41:09.271 --> 02:41:11.749
until we stepped in and put an end to it.

3665
02:41:11.749 --> 02:41:13.581
LAURA: We saw them, we fought them,

3666
02:41:13.581 --> 02:41:15.287
we followed them down to their lair,

3667
02:41:15.287 --> 02:41:18.363
where we drew them out and then closed the rift,

3668
02:41:18.363 --> 02:41:21.836
and upon closing the rift and killing the creatures,

3669
02:41:21.836 --> 02:41:24.748
we found the artifact that was causing it.

3670
02:41:24.748 --> 02:41:26.664
TRAVIS: We covered that already.

3671
02:41:26.664 --> 02:41:28.368
LAURA: Yeah, but I was making it sound cooler.

3672
02:41:28.368 --> 02:41:29.462
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

3673
02:41:29.462 --> 02:41:30.780
MATT: Make a Persuasion check.

3674
02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:32.725
(laughter)

3675
02:41:32.725 --> 02:41:34.170
SAM: See if it was cool?

3676
02:41:34.170 --> 02:41:35.560
Cool check, cool check.

3677
02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.226
LAURA: No!
SAM: Not cool.

3678
02:41:37.226 --> 02:41:38.669
LAURA: (high-pitched noises) Persuasion!

3679
02:41:38.669 --> 02:41:40.019
What do I got here?

3680
02:41:40.019 --> 02:41:40.852
10.

3681
02:41:41.881 --> 02:41:42.881
MATT: All right.

3682
02:41:44.251 --> 02:41:47.545
You see a slight grin and a cocked eyebrow

3683
02:41:47.545 --> 02:41:51.971
peek through the very intense and well-presented

3684
02:41:51.971 --> 02:41:53.971
presence of Leylas Kryn.

3685
02:41:56.036 --> 02:41:59.407
"Lady Zethriss of Den Olios also says

3686
02:41:59.407 --> 02:42:03.574
"you deferred most of your riches to seek my favor.

3687
02:42:06.048 --> 02:42:07.131
"Is this true?"

3688
02:42:08.041 --> 02:42:08.874
TRAVIS: It is.

3689
02:42:09.790 --> 02:42:11.505
Money is not as important to us

3690
02:42:11.505 --> 02:42:14.838
as a favor would be in our time of need.

3691
02:42:16.232 --> 02:42:20.065
MATT: "Well, her word carries weight with this court.

3692
02:42:23.431 --> 02:42:27.065
"Might I ask, what are your origins?

3693
02:42:28.415 --> 02:42:31.102
"You act with an air that is unique in Xhorhas,

3694
02:42:31.102 --> 02:42:34.185
"especially during these trying times.

3695
02:42:36.075 --> 02:42:37.067
LAURA: (sighs)

3696
02:42:37.067 --> 02:42:42.067
SAM: The truth is we are people without a home

3697
02:42:42.073 --> 02:42:44.698
and without a place of our own.

3698
02:42:45.708 --> 02:42:48.708
We all have different origins, but--

3699
02:42:49.675 --> 02:42:52.258
LAURA: We came together on the seas.

3700
02:42:55.289 --> 02:42:58.706
MATT: "If you are indeed to have my favor,

3701
02:42:59.918 --> 02:43:01.831
"what would you wish of me?

3702
02:43:01.831 --> 02:43:04.640
"What calls your deeds done that such threats

3703
02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:07.473
"to your own lives pre-consecution?"

3704
02:43:11.415 --> 02:43:12.268
LAURA: Well.

3705
02:43:12.268 --> 02:43:14.536
SAM: Well, we do have a favor to ask, yes, yes.

3706
02:43:14.536 --> 02:43:18.619
If I may, we are on a greater mission of our own,

3707
02:43:20.185 --> 02:43:24.602
an important mission to recover, or at least question

3708
02:43:25.713 --> 02:43:28.966
a gentleman that we believe is in your custody,

3709
02:43:28.966 --> 02:43:32.661
or at least your Dynasty's custody.

3710
02:43:32.661 --> 02:43:37.661
His last name is Brenatto, and he's a scientist, a chemist.

3711
02:43:37.922 --> 02:43:41.589
We believe that he has done some experiments

3712
02:43:42.719 --> 02:43:47.496
which have wreaked havoc in other parts of the world,

3713
02:43:47.496 --> 02:43:50.561
and caused people great suffering,

3714
02:43:50.561 --> 02:43:54.980
and as part of our mission we are to find out what he knows

3715
02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:59.897
and possibly use his information to heal some of the people

3716
02:44:01.762 --> 02:44:04.029
who are affected by his experiments.

3717
02:44:04.029 --> 02:44:06.380
LAURA: We were asked to find him and return him

3718
02:44:06.380 --> 02:44:08.675
so that he may be punished by the people there,

3719
02:44:08.675 --> 02:44:11.253
but we know he is in your custody,

3720
02:44:11.253 --> 02:44:14.586
so we understand if that's not possible.

3721
02:44:15.597 --> 02:44:16.605
MATT: I would like both of you to make

3722
02:44:16.605 --> 02:44:17.438
Deception checks, please.

3723
02:44:18.527 --> 02:44:21.008
TRAVIS: (concerned mumbling)

3724
02:44:21.008 --> 02:44:22.886
SAM: That's a one, so I'll use this.

3725
02:44:22.886 --> 02:44:25.094
(laughter)

3726
02:44:25.094 --> 02:44:27.591
MARISHA: Change that timeline.

3727
02:44:27.591 --> 02:44:29.332
SAM: Way better.

3728
02:44:29.332 --> 02:44:32.017
Still not great with my negative three.

3729
02:44:32.017 --> 02:44:33.860
LAURA: Mighty Nein for me!

3730
02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:34.801
MATT: What is it?

3731
02:44:34.801 --> 02:44:35.700
LAURA: Nine.

3732
02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:36.700
SAM: 10. (laughs)

3733
02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:37.533
LAURA: Oh jesus.

3734
02:44:37.533 --> 02:44:38.366
MATT: Okay.

3735
02:44:38.366 --> 02:44:39.874
(laughter)

3736
02:44:39.874 --> 02:44:43.880
TRAVIS: I tried to let you talk. It's your thing, but shit.

3737
02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:45.713
Deception, plus eight.

3738
02:44:48.082 --> 02:44:49.284
MATT: Okay, a couple things.

3739
02:44:49.284 --> 02:44:51.178
SAM: We are instantly dead.

3740
02:44:51.178 --> 02:44:53.428
(laughter)

3741
02:44:54.532 --> 02:44:58.366
MATT: One, the warm expression of the queen

3742
02:44:58.366 --> 02:45:02.116
becomes less warm and a bit more stone-faced.

3743
02:45:04.688 --> 02:45:08.163
Specifically in the moment that you concentrate

3744
02:45:10.863 --> 02:45:12.629
concentrate and utilize

3745
02:45:12.629 --> 02:45:15.358
that fragment of possibility within you.

3746
02:45:15.358 --> 02:45:16.237
(gasping)

3747
02:45:16.237 --> 02:45:17.963
MATT: There's a brief--

3748
02:45:17.963 --> 02:45:18.796
TRAVIS: We used it!

3749
02:45:18.796 --> 02:45:20.546
(exclamations)

3750
02:45:20.546 --> 02:45:23.907
MATT: Hold on. There is a brief,

3751
02:45:25.266 --> 02:45:28.209
just a slight head turn

3752
02:45:28.209 --> 02:45:31.789
of acknowledgement towards you, and a curious look.

3753
02:45:31.789 --> 02:45:34.255
A voice comes out from the side,

3754
02:45:34.255 --> 02:45:36.971
the left side of you, amongst the thrones that goes,

3755
02:45:36.971 --> 02:45:39.294
"My queen, if I could speak."

3756
02:45:39.294 --> 02:45:40.908
TRAVIS: (inhaling)

3757
02:45:40.908 --> 02:45:42.791
LAURA: Is that Lythir?

3758
02:45:42.791 --> 02:45:44.098
MATT: You look to your left to find the voice,

3759
02:45:44.098 --> 02:45:46.598
and Lythir is standing there.

3760
02:45:47.461 --> 02:45:48.753
"Of course."

3761
02:45:48.753 --> 02:45:50.753
She puts out a hand.

3762
02:45:52.343 --> 02:45:55.028
Lythir steps forward and goes,

3763
02:45:55.028 --> 02:45:58.877
"My eye has been caught by these travelers,

3764
02:45:58.877 --> 02:46:02.794
"for their smell is alien, their intent unclear.

3765
02:46:05.167 --> 02:46:07.219
"I myself still recover from wounds

3766
02:46:07.219 --> 02:46:09.932
"suffered along the western edges of the Ashkeeper Mountains

3767
02:46:09.932 --> 02:46:11.398
"not a week before."

3768
02:46:11.398 --> 02:46:12.231
SAM: Oh, we fucked him up.

3769
02:46:12.231 --> 02:46:15.276
MATT: "As does my partner, a lauded echo knight

3770
02:46:15.276 --> 02:46:17.787
"in your service, my queen.

3771
02:46:17.787 --> 02:46:21.189
"We came upon a troop of Dwendalian scouts

3772
02:46:21.189 --> 02:46:23.673
"seeking weakness in our borders,

3773
02:46:23.673 --> 02:46:27.142
"wishing subterfuge upon our brave soldiers.

3774
02:46:27.142 --> 02:46:31.246
"We did battle, and slew many of their filthy ilk,

3775
02:46:31.246 --> 02:46:35.428
"but were forced to flee when the tides turned against us.

3776
02:46:35.428 --> 02:46:38.978
"When these creatures, these allies of the Empire

3777
02:46:38.978 --> 02:46:39.978
"assailed us."

3778
02:46:43.608 --> 02:46:47.281
The air leaves the room as every member of this court

3779
02:46:47.281 --> 02:46:50.364
kind of stands to look down upon you.

3780
02:46:51.407 --> 02:46:54.240
The queen leans back into her gate

3781
02:46:55.717 --> 02:46:58.913
and her staff (thuds) hits the stone.

3782
02:46:58.913 --> 02:47:00.398
In that silence, she looks down at you,

3783
02:47:00.398 --> 02:47:02.148
her eyes now burning.

3784
02:47:03.153 --> 02:47:04.236
"Is this true?"

3785
02:47:08.456 --> 02:47:10.656
SAM: Yep, yep, that's true.

3786
02:47:10.656 --> 02:47:14.406
Yeah, we did fight with some of your soldiers

3787
02:47:15.663 --> 02:47:18.072
upon crossing into the Dynasty, yes.

3788
02:47:18.072 --> 02:47:21.322
LAURA: But we're not soldiers of the Empire.

3789
02:47:22.428 --> 02:47:27.428
TRAVIS: My queen, clearly the gentleman is confused,

3790
02:47:27.757 --> 02:47:31.044
we too were found and ambushed and found ourselves

3791
02:47:31.044 --> 02:47:33.614
assaulted from both sides.

3792
02:47:33.614 --> 02:47:36.343
Your friend over here did not seem to take

3793
02:47:36.343 --> 02:47:41.135
any special actions to ascertain the nature of our journey.

3794
02:47:41.135 --> 02:47:44.305
We did trade blows, although I do not recognize him

3795
02:47:44.305 --> 02:47:48.516
from the particular encounter, but yes, this did occur.

3796
02:47:48.516 --> 02:47:50.809
We were trying to make our way to the City of Beasts,

3797
02:47:50.809 --> 02:47:52.768
which we successfully did.

3798
02:47:52.768 --> 02:47:55.360
MATT: Make a Persuasion check with disadvantage.

3799
02:47:55.360 --> 02:47:58.527
SAM: Oh, disadvantage, Travis Willingham!

3800
02:47:59.435 --> 02:48:01.607
LAURA: You got this. You got this!

3801
02:48:01.607 --> 02:48:02.541
TRAVIS: Persuasion?

3802
02:48:02.541 --> 02:48:03.374
MATT: Yeah.

3803
02:48:04.733 --> 02:48:06.143
TRAVIS: 11.

3804
02:48:06.143 --> 02:48:06.976
SAM: Hey, that's over 10.

3805
02:48:06.976 --> 02:48:08.257
MARISHA: It's over 10.

3806
02:48:08.257 --> 02:48:10.140
(laughter)

3807
02:48:10.140 --> 02:48:12.227
LIAM: This one goes to 11.

3808
02:48:12.227 --> 02:48:16.193
MATT: Her chin now raised, the warmth

3809
02:48:16.193 --> 02:48:18.459
has vacated her face,

3810
02:48:18.459 --> 02:48:22.072
the expression hard and angry.

3811
02:48:24.533 --> 02:48:28.533
"I am curious why you would walk into my sanctum."

3812
02:48:34.010 --> 02:48:35.132
SAM: That's it?

3813
02:48:35.132 --> 02:48:37.336
MATT: "Have you nothing to say for yourselves?"

3814
02:48:37.336 --> 02:48:39.503
LAURA: We simply seek your aid.

3815
02:48:44.543 --> 02:48:45.376
MATT: "Guards."

3816
02:48:45.376 --> 02:48:47.190
SAM: Wait, wait!

3817
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:49.623
We have not been honest with you, it's true.

3818
02:48:49.623 --> 02:48:52.601
MATT: "Guards." I'm going to go ahead-- be back in a moment.

3819
02:48:52.601 --> 02:48:54.310
SAM: What are you doing, where are you going?

3820
02:48:54.310 --> 02:48:56.831
TRAVIS: He's getting a map. He's getting a map!

3821
02:48:56.831 --> 02:48:58.472
SAM: Are going to go into combat, Matt?

3822
02:48:58.472 --> 02:49:00.562
MATT: I don't know. It's up to you guys.

3823
02:49:00.562 --> 02:49:03.302
SAM: If we do, this combat is powered by

3824
02:49:03.302 --> 02:49:04.747
our friends at Dwarven Forge.

3825
02:49:04.747 --> 02:49:06.425
(laughter)

3826
02:49:06.425 --> 02:49:08.107
SAM: They just restockedT their most powerful

3827
02:49:08.107 --> 02:49:09.841
Dungeon of Doom sets, which are available

3828
02:49:09.841 --> 02:49:11.629
in their store now at DwarvenForge.com.

3829
02:49:11.629 --> 02:49:14.912
Go get it. This combat should be interesting

3830
02:49:14.912 --> 02:49:17.300
for everyone watching.

3831
02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:18.826
If it's combat.

3832
02:49:18.826 --> 02:49:20.122
LAURA: No, we do not need to fight them.

3833
02:49:20.122 --> 02:49:20.955
We are not going to fight.

3834
02:49:20.955 --> 02:49:21.788
MARISHA: No, we have to surrender.

3835
02:49:22.848 --> 02:49:24.848
LAURA: We're not going to fight.

3836
02:49:25.739 --> 02:49:28.230
SAM: I mean, there's a million people, and

3837
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:30.392
chairs everywhere!

3838
02:49:30.392 --> 02:49:32.225
Deadly, deadly chairs.

3839
02:49:33.106 --> 02:49:35.277
(laughter)

3840
02:49:35.277 --> 02:49:37.027
MARISHA: Never trust chairs.

3841
02:49:39.588 --> 02:49:40.671
LAURA: God dammit.

3842
02:49:42.771 --> 02:49:45.159
Just a couple fucking rolls.

3843
02:49:45.159 --> 02:49:47.659
MATT: Like all of the rough rolls, guys.

3844
02:49:48.619 --> 02:49:51.804
SAM: We might die?

3845
02:49:51.804 --> 02:49:54.163
MARISHA: We fucked up in not recognizing--

3846
02:49:54.163 --> 02:49:56.216
MATT: The guards immediately start approaching.

3847
02:49:56.216 --> 02:49:59.792
Are you guys fighting or are you surrendering?

3848
02:49:59.792 --> 02:50:01.031
LAURA: No, wait, wait!

3849
02:50:01.031 --> 02:50:02.072
MARISHA: Put up our hands.

3850
02:50:02.072 --> 02:50:03.408
SAM: Throw up our hands, yeah.

3851
02:50:03.408 --> 02:50:05.025
MATT: All right, you are surrendering.

3852
02:50:05.025 --> 02:50:06.322
SAM: Yeah.

3853
02:50:06.322 --> 02:50:07.579
MATT: All right.

3854
02:50:07.579 --> 02:50:08.969
LAURA: What are we going to do, fight you guys?

3855
02:50:08.969 --> 02:50:11.302
You guys are super powerful.

3856
02:50:12.495 --> 02:50:13.328
MATT: Okay.

3857
02:50:13.328 --> 02:50:15.224
LAURA: We don't work for the Empire!

3858
02:50:15.224 --> 02:50:16.688
Please!

3859
02:50:16.688 --> 02:50:21.021
MATT: The guards all approach, stepping up to the sides,

3860
02:50:22.165 --> 02:50:26.732
here behind, and here, and here.

3861
02:50:27.951 --> 02:50:29.513
LAURA: What should we do?

3862
02:50:29.513 --> 02:50:31.482
Quick, say something.

3863
02:50:31.482 --> 02:50:33.623
MATT: More begin to arrive up.

3864
02:50:33.623 --> 02:50:35.188
SAM: We have to tell them the truth.

3865
02:50:35.188 --> 02:50:36.848
LAURA: Tell her the truth.

3866
02:50:36.848 --> 02:50:38.093
SAM: Yes, yes.

3867
02:50:38.093 --> 02:50:38.929
LAURA: Just tell her!

3868
02:50:38.929 --> 02:50:40.290
MATT: She turns and sits back down on the throne.

3869
02:50:40.290 --> 02:50:42.212
Everyone else begins to sit down.

3870
02:50:42.212 --> 02:50:45.545
They seem to have lost attention on you in the moment,

3871
02:50:45.545 --> 02:50:47.721
and the guards begin to rush forward

3872
02:50:47.721 --> 02:50:49.346
and just grab you at the shoulders.

3873
02:50:49.346 --> 02:50:51.428
They grab Caleb.

3874
02:50:51.428 --> 02:50:55.645
LIAM: I'm sorry! We are sorry. We have come

3875
02:50:55.645 --> 02:50:57.545
to bring you something.

3876
02:50:58.534 --> 02:51:00.875
We have to come to bring you something.

3877
02:51:00.875 --> 02:51:03.345
We have come a long way.

3878
02:51:03.345 --> 02:51:04.668
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

3879
02:51:04.668 --> 02:51:06.425
SAM: Oh no, oh no.

3880
02:51:06.425 --> 02:51:09.554
TRAVIS: Just get arrested, man. Just get arrested.

3881
02:51:09.554 --> 02:51:11.748
LAURA: I think we should do it.

3882
02:51:11.748 --> 02:51:12.748
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

3883
02:51:13.684 --> 02:51:15.715
MATT: They've pushed Caduceus onto the ground.

3884
02:51:15.715 --> 02:51:19.417
Yasha's currently being put into shackles.

3885
02:51:19.417 --> 02:51:21.375
SAM: Please, please, spare us.

3886
02:51:21.375 --> 02:51:24.534
He's my husband. You have my husband.

3887
02:51:24.534 --> 02:51:27.221
You're holding my husband.

3888
02:51:27.221 --> 02:51:30.054
MATT: There's no attention being paid.

3889
02:51:31.688 --> 02:51:33.821
LIAM: The Empire is working against you.

3890
02:51:33.821 --> 02:51:36.618
Wildemount is working against you

3891
02:51:36.618 --> 02:51:39.449
and we have brought the proof, if you will

3892
02:51:39.449 --> 02:51:41.716
allow me to show it to you.

3893
02:51:41.716 --> 02:51:45.484
MATT: Zythier across the way goes, "What proof?"

3894
02:51:45.484 --> 02:51:48.067
LIAM: I need to approach my friend.

3895
02:51:49.019 --> 02:51:53.375
I mean no harm. I need to remove something from--

3896
02:51:53.375 --> 02:51:55.515
MATT: Make a Persuasion check.

3897
02:51:55.515 --> 02:51:56.848
SAM: Oh boy.

3898
02:51:56.848 --> 02:52:00.098
Oh boy, this went perfectly in my head.

3899
02:52:03.393 --> 02:52:04.878
LIAM: 16.

3900
02:52:04.878 --> 02:52:05.711
MATT: 16.

3901
02:52:09.517 --> 02:52:11.571
"You have a moment.

3902
02:52:11.571 --> 02:52:14.651
"Anything strange and I take off your head."

3903
02:52:14.651 --> 02:52:17.484
LIAM: Jester, I'm coming to you, okay?

3904
02:52:18.473 --> 02:52:21.223
I am just going to open this bag.

3905
02:52:24.031 --> 02:52:26.705
MATT: As you reach for it, you hear the sound

3906
02:52:26.705 --> 02:52:30.069
of many blades being drawn as you reach for the bag.

3907
02:52:30.069 --> 02:52:32.884
Echoing through the immense chamber,

3908
02:52:32.884 --> 02:52:35.127
the bright light bearing down on top of you.

3909
02:52:35.127 --> 02:52:37.583
You can feel the sweat beads forming

3910
02:52:37.583 --> 02:52:41.410
and dripping down your forehead and gathering on your brow.

3911
02:52:41.410 --> 02:52:44.577
LIAM: I say this as a child of the Empire.

3912
02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:51.020
Connected to inner circles there long ago.

3913
02:52:52.282 --> 02:52:54.729
And I reach in and grab the dodecahedron.

3914
02:52:54.729 --> 02:52:56.426
SAM: (gasping)

3915
02:52:56.426 --> 02:52:57.259
MATT: Okay.

3916
02:52:58.530 --> 02:53:00.002
SAM: Oh god!

3917
02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:02.661
LIAM: And lift it into the air.

3918
02:53:02.661 --> 02:53:03.494
MARISHA: I thought you were going to get out

3919
02:53:03.494 --> 02:53:04.327
the tripod first.

3920
02:53:05.297 --> 02:53:06.872
SAM: Go big or go home.

3921
02:53:06.872 --> 02:53:07.705
MATT: Okay.

3922
02:53:10.249 --> 02:53:13.666
The minute you pull the dodecahedron out,

3923
02:53:16.689 --> 02:53:20.044
you hear the clattering of metal.

3924
02:53:20.044 --> 02:53:23.260
(imitates clanging)

3925
02:53:23.260 --> 02:53:24.787
"(gasps)"

3926
02:53:24.787 --> 02:53:26.133
Gasps.

3927
02:53:26.133 --> 02:53:29.552
If you thought air was escaped from the room before,

3928
02:53:29.552 --> 02:53:32.052
it is a vacuum now in silence.

3929
02:53:33.192 --> 02:53:36.605
The thrum of the object in your hand,

3930
02:53:36.605 --> 02:53:39.873
the light pulsing, like the heartbeat

3931
02:53:39.873 --> 02:53:42.373
since the moment you found it.

3932
02:53:43.789 --> 02:53:47.815
You see every eye upon you, and the queen,

3933
02:53:47.815 --> 02:53:51.606
the Bright Queen herself Leylas Kryn,

3934
02:53:51.606 --> 02:53:56.247
has stepped around the art object,

3935
02:53:56.247 --> 02:53:59.271
the symbol that sits before her throne

3936
02:53:59.271 --> 02:54:02.589
and looks down straight into it, her eyes wide,

3937
02:54:02.589 --> 02:54:06.672
you see tears forming at the corners of her face.

3938
02:54:08.919 --> 02:54:10.669
LIAM: I am of the Empire.

3939
02:54:12.349 --> 02:54:16.957
But I am no friend to the Empire.

3940
02:54:19.124 --> 02:54:23.041
One of your own came to retrieve this and fell.

3941
02:54:25.272 --> 02:54:28.680
And I bring it to you.

3942
02:54:30.136 --> 02:54:32.025
I set it down in front of Jester,

3943
02:54:32.025 --> 02:54:34.348
two or three feet in front of her feet

3944
02:54:34.348 --> 02:54:36.739
and raise my hands back into the air.

3945
02:54:38.980 --> 02:54:41.233
MATT: Everyone is just locked in on this

3946
02:54:41.233 --> 02:54:45.133
and slowly they all begin to look to the Bright Queen.

3947
02:54:45.133 --> 02:54:47.275
She holds her staff up and says,

3948
02:54:48.773 --> 02:54:50.823
"Release their bindings."

3949
02:54:52.411 --> 02:54:55.969
One by one, you find your chains,

3950
02:54:57.132 --> 02:55:00.390
your manacles, pulled away.

3951
02:55:02.438 --> 02:55:07.048
The queen takes a step, and another, and another,

3952
02:55:07.048 --> 02:55:10.798
and approaches, tall, elegant with each step.

3953
02:55:12.888 --> 02:55:16.340
She approaches, and she's even more imposing,

3954
02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:20.923
more beautiful and ethereal the closer she gets to you.

3955
02:55:22.915 --> 02:55:26.640
She sets her staff aside and reaches down

3956
02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:29.390
and from the handles picks it up.

3957
02:55:36.408 --> 02:55:37.908
"You bring us hope.

3958
02:55:44.850 --> 02:55:48.815
"And you have undone one of many great wounds

3959
02:55:48.815 --> 02:55:50.232
"against us today.

3960
02:55:54.984 --> 02:55:56.317
"I have no words.

3961
02:55:59.017 --> 02:56:01.767
"My emotions burn within my chest.

3962
02:56:09.304 --> 02:56:12.221
"If you are no friend to the Empire,

3963
02:56:13.907 --> 02:56:18.407
"you have certainly today become heroes of the Dynasty."

3964
02:56:19.689 --> 02:56:22.745
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

3965
02:56:22.745 --> 02:56:24.411
(yelling and laughter)

3966
02:56:24.411 --> 02:56:26.751
MATT: Because it's 10:00 and I want to do Taliesin in this

3967
02:56:26.751 --> 02:56:27.972
when we come back in a couple weeks.

3968
02:56:27.972 --> 02:56:29.982
Plus it's a fun moment to finish.

3969
02:56:29.982 --> 02:56:31.155
LAURA: Oh, that's right, we're taking next week off.

3970
02:56:31.155 --> 02:56:32.215
MATT: Taking next week off, yeah.

3971
02:56:32.215 --> 02:56:33.823
(laughter)

3972
02:56:33.823 --> 02:56:34.656
SAM: Oh god!

3973
02:56:36.438 --> 02:56:37.482
MATT: Oh man!

3974
02:56:37.482 --> 02:56:38.563
Okay!

3975
02:56:38.563 --> 02:56:39.925
That turned that around.

3976
02:56:39.925 --> 02:56:41.008
(laughter)

3977
02:56:41.008 --> 02:56:41.915
SAM: Oh god.

3978
02:56:41.915 --> 02:56:43.354
MATT: I was like all right, they're going to go to prison,

3979
02:56:43.354 --> 02:56:44.595
and they'll go back there, and maybe like

3980
02:56:44.595 --> 02:56:45.701
try to find out where he is in the prison.

3981
02:56:45.701 --> 02:56:46.688
No, no, okay.

3982
02:56:46.688 --> 02:56:48.266
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3983
02:56:48.266 --> 02:56:50.553
MATT: (exhales)

3984
02:56:50.553 --> 02:56:51.975
LIAM: There's my die.

3985
02:56:51.975 --> 02:56:52.833
MATT: Yeah.

3986
02:56:52.833 --> 02:56:53.763
LIAM: That I was looking for.

3987
02:56:53.763 --> 02:56:54.763
MATT: That's where it is.

3988
02:56:54.763 --> 02:56:55.596
LIAM: Part of the world.

3989
02:56:55.596 --> 02:56:58.202
(laughter)

3990
02:56:58.202 --> 02:56:59.056
MARISHA: All right.

3991
02:56:59.056 --> 02:56:59.947
MATT: Okay.

3992
02:56:59.947 --> 02:57:02.651
TRAVIS: Yeah, figured her husband was in jail,

3993
02:57:02.651 --> 02:57:05.234
where we were going to be sent to.

3994
02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:07.421
But no.

3995
02:57:07.421 --> 02:57:09.897
MARISHA: Because he did say that he was

3996
02:57:09.897 --> 02:57:11.929
going to like Rosohna, right?

3997
02:57:11.929 --> 02:57:12.762
SAM: Huh?

3998
02:57:12.762 --> 02:57:14.213
LAURA: He didn't say.

3999
02:57:14.213 --> 02:57:15.046
MARISHA: He didn't say?

4000
02:57:15.046 --> 02:57:17.109
TRAVIS: We never even got to try it with the tripod.

4001
02:57:17.109 --> 02:57:17.942
LAURA: I know.

4002
02:57:18.877 --> 02:57:20.645
Maybe we can give her the tripod, too,

4003
02:57:20.645 --> 02:57:22.520
and just you know, tell her--

4004
02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:23.974
SAM: Just go full Kryn?

4005
02:57:23.974 --> 02:57:25.874
LAURA: Say like-- tell her to give it a whirl

4006
02:57:25.874 --> 02:57:27.014
while we're still in there.

4007
02:57:27.014 --> 02:57:28.688
(laughter)

4008
02:57:28.688 --> 02:57:30.160
MATT: Okay.

4009
02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:32.200
I've got a lot to think about over these next two weeks.

4010
02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:33.200
SAM: Oh god.

4011
02:57:34.128 --> 02:57:34.961
Oh god.

4012
02:57:34.961 --> 02:57:35.794
MARISHA: So much.

4013
02:57:37.813 --> 02:57:38.646
MATT: Oh man.

4014
02:57:39.578 --> 02:57:41.328
All right, all right.

4015
02:57:42.496 --> 02:57:47.496
You've returned the beacon to the Kryn, okay.

4016
02:57:48.018 --> 02:57:49.901
SAM: So are they super powerful now

4017
02:57:49.901 --> 02:57:51.342
and they're going to-- oh god.

4018
02:57:51.342 --> 02:57:52.992
MARISHA: Destroy the Empire?

4019
02:57:52.992 --> 02:57:54.440
TRAVIS: Let's just go back to the third temple

4020
02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:56.350
and get Uk'otoa out here while we're at it,

4021
02:57:56.350 --> 02:57:57.618
I mean, fuckin'...

4022
02:57:57.618 --> 02:57:58.811
(laughter)

4023
02:57:58.811 --> 02:58:00.355
TRAVIS: What have we got to lose?

4024
02:58:00.355 --> 02:58:01.188
MATT: Okay.

4025
02:58:02.271 --> 02:58:03.104
All right.

4026
02:58:03.104 --> 02:58:04.469
Guys, well done.

4027
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:05.695
SAM: Well done?

4028
02:58:05.695 --> 02:58:08.864
MATT: Yeah, you did something crazy!

4029
02:58:08.864 --> 02:58:10.665
SAM: We gave the nuke to the bad guys!

4030
02:58:10.665 --> 02:58:11.498
Bad guys?

4031
02:58:11.498 --> 02:58:12.842
Are they good guys?

4032
02:58:12.842 --> 02:58:14.351
LIAM: Is the Empire good guys?

4033
02:58:14.351 --> 02:58:17.962
Is there a way to lose Dungeons &amp; Dragons other than a TPK?

4034
02:58:17.962 --> 02:58:19.907
SAM: We gave somebody a nuke, oh god.

4035
02:58:19.907 --> 02:58:23.062
MATT: Well, you might be in a position

4036
02:58:23.062 --> 02:58:25.061
to learn a lot more about the dynamics

4037
02:58:25.061 --> 02:58:27.714
of the world larger than you now that you've made

4038
02:58:27.714 --> 02:58:30.276
a very huge ally very quickly.

4039
02:58:30.276 --> 02:58:31.109
SAM: Nice.

4040
02:58:32.984 --> 02:58:35.342
MATT: Oh, this is going to be real interesting.

4041
02:58:35.342 --> 02:58:36.175
SAM: Oh god.

4042
02:58:37.026 --> 02:58:39.291
LIAM: We got two weeks to think about it.

4043
02:58:39.291 --> 02:58:40.280
TRAVIS: This map, right?

4044
02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:44.305
This map covers the areas that we've just declared war with.

4045
02:58:44.305 --> 02:58:45.782
(laughter)

4046
02:58:45.782 --> 02:58:48.918
TRAVIS: We are a part of this part of the map.

4047
02:58:48.918 --> 02:58:50.575
This is us.

4048
02:58:50.575 --> 02:58:53.170
Fuck this whole thing.

4049
02:58:53.170 --> 02:58:55.337
Us, no longer safe for us.

4050
02:58:56.848 --> 02:58:58.348
LAURA: Not necessarily.

4051
02:59:00.232 --> 02:59:02.290
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Mmmm, pretty sure.

4052
02:59:02.290 --> 02:59:04.393
LIAM: So the Empire doesn't know where the dodeca went.

4053
02:59:04.393 --> 02:59:06.035
As far as they know, someone broke into the tower

4054
02:59:06.035 --> 02:59:07.145
and took it.

4055
02:59:07.145 --> 02:59:08.728
LAURA: Yeah.

4056
02:59:08.728 --> 02:59:09.656
SAM: Oh boy.

4057
02:59:09.656 --> 02:59:10.489
LAURA: They didn't know that we took it.

4058
02:59:10.489 --> 02:59:12.155
LIAM: The Kryn took it.

4059
02:59:12.155 --> 02:59:13.072
MATT: Well.

4060
02:59:14.450 --> 02:59:15.812
Well done.

4061
02:59:15.812 --> 02:59:17.894
Sadly no combat, but at least you get to see

4062
02:59:17.894 --> 02:59:19.277
the throne room.

4063
02:59:19.277 --> 02:59:21.174
SAM: How would we even survive that?

4064
02:59:21.174 --> 02:59:22.860
LIAM: Did we use the new cameras?

4065
02:59:22.860 --> 02:59:25.385
MATT: I'm not saying that you would've survived

4066
02:59:25.385 --> 02:59:28.499
at the very least, but I'm just, going off

4067
02:59:28.499 --> 02:59:30.419
of our previous experiences, sometimes,

4068
02:59:30.419 --> 02:59:31.712
I don't know what you guys are going to do.

4069
02:59:31.712 --> 02:59:32.640
SAM: Yeah, I know.

4070
02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:33.812
MATT: I knew it was a possibility you'd surrender,

4071
02:59:33.812 --> 02:59:35.801
I knew it was a possibility you'd try and be like

4072
02:59:35.801 --> 02:59:38.736
fuck this, I'm going to get out and make a crazy escape!

4073
02:59:38.736 --> 02:59:42.203
Then it would've, but fuck, that was--

4074
02:59:42.203 --> 02:59:44.828
LAURA: Ride or die, bitches. Ride or die!

4075
02:59:44.828 --> 02:59:45.661
TRAVIS: We teleported in.

4076
02:59:45.661 --> 02:59:47.027
I don't think we were trying to escape.

4077
02:59:47.027 --> 02:59:49.140
Did think we were going to jail,

4078
02:59:49.140 --> 02:59:51.579
which is maybe where we were trying to go

4079
02:59:51.579 --> 02:59:52.644
in the first place.

4080
02:59:52.644 --> 02:59:53.587
(laughter)

4081
02:59:53.587 --> 02:59:54.646
SAM: It's all good.

4082
02:59:54.646 --> 02:59:55.799
LIAM: We're in a position of power now.

4083
02:59:55.799 --> 02:59:57.000
We are.

4084
02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:00.203
MATT: That one surviving dude.

4085
03:00:00.203 --> 03:00:03.010
LAURA: Yeah, man, I'm surprised we didn't recognize him.

4086
03:00:03.010 --> 03:00:04.343
He was in armor.

4087
03:00:05.207 --> 03:00:06.736
Motherfucker.

4088
03:00:06.736 --> 03:00:08.342
TRAVIS: Oh, so oh.

4089
03:00:08.342 --> 03:00:10.283
MATT: Yeah, and your Insight check wasn't high enough

4090
03:00:10.283 --> 03:00:12.185
to get more information about his response to you

4091
03:00:12.185 --> 03:00:13.412
when you guys had entered the chamber.

4092
03:00:13.412 --> 03:00:15.001
LIAM: Also legitimately, for all we knew

4093
03:00:15.001 --> 03:00:16.473
we were about to be murdered on the spot.

4094
03:00:16.473 --> 03:00:18.372
SAM: Absolutely.

4095
03:00:18.372 --> 03:00:20.314
MATT: Well, cool.

4096
03:00:20.314 --> 03:00:24.957
I'm super excited to see what happens now.

4097
03:00:24.957 --> 03:00:28.235
Well, all right guys, well. (laughs)

4098
03:00:28.235 --> 03:00:31.052
TRAVIS: Let me go home and rewrite some stuff.

4099
03:00:31.052 --> 03:00:33.421
MATT: Well, I've got some prep to do.

4100
03:00:33.421 --> 03:00:35.553
I've got some prep to do.

4101
03:00:35.553 --> 03:00:36.386
TRAVIS: Toss some binders out.

4102
03:00:36.386 --> 03:00:38.405
MATT: I'm glad we have a week off now.

4103
03:00:38.405 --> 03:00:40.729
Anyway, we'll see you guys.

4104
03:00:40.729 --> 03:00:42.537
As a reminder, we're off next week. We'll be dark for that.

4105
03:00:42.537 --> 03:00:44.557
We'll still have content and stuff

4106
03:00:44.557 --> 03:00:45.930
throughout the channel throughout the week.

4107
03:00:45.930 --> 03:00:48.397
We'll be back the 4th of April, I believe. April 4th.

4108
03:00:48.397 --> 03:00:50.073
TRAVIS: That's correct.

4109
03:00:50.073 --> 03:00:53.964
MATT: So, enjoy your time off, we'll enjoy ours,

4110
03:00:53.964 --> 03:00:56.591
and as always, we love you very much,

4111
03:00:56.591 --> 03:00:59.024
and is it Thursday yet?

4112
03:00:59.024 --> 03:00:59.879
Good night.

4113
03:00:59.879 --> 03:01:00.870
TRAVIS: See you in two weeks!

4114
03:01:00.870 --> 03:01:01.770
MATT: Bye, guys.

4115
03:01:01.770 --> 03:01:06.703
(dramatic music)

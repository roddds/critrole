00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:03.162
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.216 --> 00:00:04.811
sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:06.762
(cheering)

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:10.811
MATT: Before we get into the chaos of tonight's
game, we have some announcements to get through.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:15.253
First, beginning with our fantastic sponsor of
campaign two, up to this point and going forward

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:20.919
for hopefully infinity, D&amp;amp;D Beyond. Sam, if you
want to take it away.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:27.895
SAM: I will indeed. Guys, D&amp;amp;D Beyond will be
streaming tomorrow, June 15th, live from Origins

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:33.805
Game F-- Uh-oh. I've forgotten something in my
car. Laura, take over.

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:43.453
LAURA: Ugh, no, what is he doing to me? --from
Origins Game Fair! Check out twitch.tv/DnDBeyond--

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:54.225
N, not &amp;amp;-- starting at 12:00 pm Eastern time, to
catch interviews, the monthly D&amp;amp;D Beyon-- What?

00:00:54.225 --> 00:01:02.500
SAM: Buenos noches, I am the masked vigilante
named Storro. I fight injustice and defend the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.263
innocent in order to send them to the D&amp;amp;D Beyond
Store-o.

00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:07.965
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:16.978
SAM: Mine is a dangerous cause, filled with scary
monsters, vile beasts, devilish devils. All of

00:01:16.978 --> 00:01:24.371
them can be found in the various Monster Manuals
at the D&amp;amp;D Beyond Store-o. Aha! What is this?! It

00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:31.182
is a generic tablet device, displaying a handsome
array of content and inventory to streamline your

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:39.139
tabletop gameplay. Why, this can only be the
infamous handiwork of D&amp;amp;D Beyond. With my blade, I

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:46.631
cut down on prep time, I slice my physical book
collection in half, I slay the enemies of book

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:54.831
management? For I am (click click click) Storro!
And I will never stop fighting until our D&amp;amp;D

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:59.950
Beyond contract expires! And then I will stop
fighting! Hyah!

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.615
TRAVIS: Who was that masked man?

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:08.631
SAM: Oh boy, guys! What did--

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:10.913
TRAVIS: Did you find what you needed in your car,
Sam?

00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:17.980
SAM: Yeah, you know what? It was right here, it
was this thing. Check out twitch.tv/DnDBeyond

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.531
starting at 12:00 pm Eastern time to catch
interviews, the monthly D&amp;amp;D Beyond dev update,

00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:30.973
Q&amp;amp;A, and a live play session with exclusive
reveals from Dwarven Forge's upcoming KS6. I don't

00:02:30.973 --> 00:02:32.173
know what that is!

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:34.250
MATT: Their sixth Kickstarter.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.092
LAURA: Oh! You didn't plan a commercial at all
this time.

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:40.915
SAM: I didn't plan any commercial today, it was
just--

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:44.927
TRAVIS: There was a guy that-- you know what? It's
not important. Great job.

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:46.554
MATT: Well done, buddy.

00:02:46.554 --> 00:02:49.372
MARISHA: It feels like the longest walk yet.

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:52.202
(laughter)

00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:57.957
SAM: You know the thing when you find a mask at
home and you're like, "I can do a bit with this!"

00:02:57.957 --> 00:02:59.962
That's the whole thing.

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:09.063
MATT: Thank you, Sam. And thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.
Storro lives on in our hearts. Hopefully only in

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:18.137
our hearts. A few other updates. One: we have the
standard editions of Vox Machina Origins are still

00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:24.459
available at Geek &amp;amp; Sundry and the Alpha online
shops. The special editions are gone. So you can

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.960
find details at critrole.com. Talks Machina is our
after-show every Tuesday, and this episode's

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.982
episode will be next Tuesday at 7:00 pm Pacific
time, where a number of members of our cast will

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:40.232
be talking with our fantastic Cabbage Master,
Brian W. Foster, to discuss the events of

00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:47.690
tonight's evening's episode. We'll have giveaway
prizes for Gif and Fanart of the Week. Make sure

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.720
that you submit them to submit@talksmachina.com.
Currently only U.S and Canada, excluding Quebec,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.135
are eligible to enter and win because of dumb
rules. Also a reminder that Twitch Prime allows

00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:05.361
you, if you have your Amazon Prime account, to
attach with your Twitch account to subscribe to a

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:11.191
channel for free on Twitch once a month. If you
can, do so. It's free. And that is it, and that's

00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:12.999
all; short announcements tonight.

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.229
SAM: Wait.

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.140
EVERYONE: Wait.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.230
LIAM: Wait, there's one more. I have a thing. This
is not an announcement. One of the artists in our

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.929
community, Jason deBit, who's been with us since
the very beginning-- old-school Critter, has made

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:32.856
great art, he's made art on his son's sandwich
bags for years, and he made a lot of Critical Role

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:37.558
art, too. He contacted me a couple of weeks ago
and said something's coming, be on the lookout for

00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:42.653
it. He gave me a vague idea of what it was and
didn't prepare me for what I'm about to show you

00:04:42.653 --> 00:04:48.966
guys. It's cabbage. So this is another example of
how unbelievable the people in our audience are.

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:59.624
So Jason had an idea in 2016 to take a sketchbook
and mail it around to other artists in the community.

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:05.680
This book and this box, because it's covered
in notes, I'll let you guys look later, but this

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:15.074
book has been traveling the planet since 2016.
Instantly started crying looking at this book. The rules,

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:17.876
"When you finish with this book, email Jason,
yadda yadda, if you use a medium that bleeds--

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:22.711
"Decorate it, send it on to the next person." It's
been traveling. The very first one, I'll find

00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:29.508
some-- Kat Winslade has done art for ages. I
can't. I just can't.

00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:31.021
MARISHA: Oh! It's Darragh!

00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:38.788
LIAM: Yeah, Mikandii, Ameera, just a couple.
Lloyd. I'm not going to do everyone justice, and

00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:49.130
I'm going to take pictures of this. Every single
picture in here. I opened this up for the first

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.937
time an hour before the show and was openly
weeping, like Liam O'Brien is wont to do.

00:05:54.937 --> 00:06:04.383
Charlotte. There's one more that I want to find
that I really like. That one's really good too.

00:06:04.383 --> 00:06:09.626
I'll take pictures of all of them, but I can't
tell you how much this meant to me and obviously

00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:14.199
to all them seeing it for the first time. Thank
you. We have the best audience on planet Earth,

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:21.023
bar none. Legitimately, thank you. Really, really,
thank you. I'm looking at the wrong camera.

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:22.274
Amazing.

00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:25.611
TRAVIS: It doesn't matter, that's incredible.
Wow.

00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:31.600
LIAM: We'll pass it around. Everyone will see it.
The audience will all see it. Thank you.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.505
MATT: There will be tears at break.

00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:35.755
LIAM: (fake crying) Okay, we'd better start the
game!

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:52.246
MATT: Thank you guys so much, oh my god. No, we're
good. And on that note, let's bring us into

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:57.086
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:06:57.086 --> 00:07:00.887
[click, TV static]

00:07:00.887 --> 00:08:18.978
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:26.244
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Last we left off,
The Mighty Nein had been traversing northward

00:08:26.244 --> 00:08:32.959
towards the Labenda Swamp, to make good on the
first of two jobs they had accepted from The

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:37.873
Gentleman back in Zadash. Upon traveling
northward, you made a young feathered friend by

00:08:37.873 --> 00:08:43.938
the name of Kiri, who's been under your protection
since. You briefly met Cali, who is a

00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:48.769
dragon-blooded sorcerer who joined you for a
length of the journey. You managed to discover

00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:55.569
where the seemingly cut-off and abandoned safe
house was. Beneath it, discovered what had been

00:08:55.569 --> 00:09:03.308
responsible for it going silent, by an underground
tunnel network run by swamp merrow. You engaged

00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:08.319
with them, found a strange altar room where they
had amassed everything they had stolen from the

00:09:08.319 --> 00:09:16.043
safe house, slaughtered the present shallow priest
and his protectors, took what was necessary and

00:09:16.043 --> 00:09:23.059
what was of interest from that pile, including an
interesting orb, made your way back out, closed

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:29.716
the pathway the merrow had to the safe house, thus
establishing its true safety once more, and

00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:33.705
completing the job of which you were tasked.
There, you spent an evening resting, and began

00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:39.757
heading back out to return from the northern
center of Labenda Swamp towards the town of

00:09:39.757 --> 00:09:46.496
Berleben, and to where the next leg of your
journey takes you. Mighty Nein, as you begin

00:09:46.496 --> 00:09:52.488
heading southward into the daytime of the thick,
heavy swamp, what would you like to do?

00:09:52.488 --> 00:10:01.021
TRAVIS: I forget, are we returning back to report
in between missions, or are we doing a twofer?

00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:06.434
LAURA: I can send a message to the Gentleman, so
we don't have to go back.

00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:08.582
SAM: How can you do that? He's terribly far away.

00:10:08.582 --> 00:10:12.508
LAURA: I keep wanting to use this spell that I
have, but I haven't been able to do it yet.

00:10:12.508 --> 00:10:14.429
TRAVIS: What spell's that?

00:10:14.429 --> 00:10:16.014
LAURA: It's called Sending.

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:17.509
TRAVIS: Sending?

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:18.988
LAURA: Yeah, I can send a message.

00:10:18.988 --> 00:10:21.434
LIAM: That is a literal description.

00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:25.550
TRAVIS: I guess that would cover it, then.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:31.167
LAURA: But it's one of my most powerful spells,
you guys, so if we're going to fight somebody, I

00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:32.899
don't know if it's smart.

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:39.674
ASHLEY: Do you send an actual message, or is it a
piece of paper?

00:10:39.674 --> 00:10:43.316
LAURA: It's like a piece of paper of the mind.

00:10:43.316 --> 00:10:44.726
ASHLEY: Ooh.

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:47.399
TRAVIS: You lost me a little.

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:48.990
LAURA: Do you want me to do it?

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.040
SAM: Shouldn't we get out of the swamp first? What
if there are scaries around?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.005
TRAVIS: What time is it about, in the sky parts?

00:10:56.005 --> 00:11:01.168
MATT: If I recall, you guys had taken a long rest
after your previous battle, so now it's

00:11:01.168 --> 00:11:03.231
mid-morning, I'd say.

00:11:03.231 --> 00:11:07.998
TRAVIS: Jester, maybe not just yet. Maybe before
we go to sleep.

00:11:07.998 --> 00:11:09.321
LAURA: At the end of the day?

00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:12.055
TALIESIN: Well, like so many good things, we can
do it back when we get to the hotel.

00:11:12.055 --> 00:11:15.999
LAURA: Okay. Do we want to go find that troll
guy?

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:18.755
ASHLEY: To get that 100 gold back?

00:11:18.755 --> 00:11:23.390
MARISHA: I did almost die, which was pretty
awesome.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.657
TRAVIS: And remember, he bleeds damaging liquids.

00:11:26.657 --> 00:11:28.709
LAURA: So we stay far away this time.

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:30.806
MARISHA: Do we have any more boom-boom sticks?

00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:38.765
SAM: I think we have one. We can go blow up his
house. That seems petty.

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:41.201
TRAVIS: Or something that we would totally do.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.151
MARISHA: He almost killed me and definitely killed
our guide.

00:11:44.151 --> 00:11:45.567
SAM: Yeah, we should blow up his house.

00:11:45.567 --> 00:11:46.771
TRAVIS: I'm down for that.

00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:48.356
MARISHA: Sounds fun.

00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:53.015
TRAVIS: Two votes. Three votes. Four, five votes.

00:11:53.015 --> 00:11:54.946
LIAM: I defer to the group.

00:11:54.946 --> 00:11:56.675
TRAVIS: Are you abstaining?

00:11:56.675 --> 00:12:04.409
LIAM: No. Okay, let's go. I do not have a cat in
this hunt, but whatever you want to do, I will

00:12:04.409 --> 00:12:05.569
support.

00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:12.116
ASHLEY: Throw it in and see how it goes, and then
we can run if he's-- How do we know if he's in

00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:13.350
there, though?

00:12:13.412 --> 00:12:18.777
TALIESIN: You can sneak up, take a look, rob it,
and then throw a stick of dynamite in just

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:24.099
because, if we're going to be those people. What
happens if he's actually there?

00:12:24.099 --> 00:12:30.049
MARISHA: Wait, what do you mean by "those people"?
Do you know a lot of people who throw dynamite in houses?

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:33.860
TALIESIN: Yeah. I feel like that's pretty obvious,
at this point.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.382
TRAVIS: I feel like I knew that about you.

00:12:36.382 --> 00:12:38.442
TALIESIN: I just like having a game plan.

00:12:38.442 --> 00:12:43.714
TRAVIS: Sure. Maybe we have Nott bolt in, right,
everybody else stand back, because you're super

00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:44.741
fast, right?

00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:45.941
SAM: Yeah, I guess.

00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:47.018
TRAVIS: Very dextrous?

00:12:47.018 --> 00:12:47.852
SAM: Sure.

00:12:47.852 --> 00:12:52.321
TRAVIS: Yeah, then you run in and toss that
sucker. If he pops out, we light it up from afar.

00:12:52.321 --> 00:13:00.137
SAM: So I'm going to be carrying an explosive
device into a troll's house, solo?

00:13:00.137 --> 00:13:02.569
LAURA: No, you just throw it in the door. You
don't have to walk in.

00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:06.993
SAM: Just to play troll's advocate here, what if
it's not his house?

00:13:06.993 --> 00:13:08.681
LAURA: I know. That's the thing, right?

00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:10.779
SAM: What if we're blowing up an innocent troll's
house?

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:12.244
TALIESIN: Then we should rob it first.

00:13:12.244 --> 00:13:15.093
LAURA: We'll send Frumpkin in first.

00:13:15.093 --> 00:13:21.293
TALIESIN: There'll be a body curing, if it is his
house. We'll know, because there'll be a body

00:13:21.293 --> 00:13:23.475
curing and getting nice and ripe.

00:13:23.475 --> 00:13:29.438
LIAM: We also had no qualms about sending a highly
decorated richter to the guillotine, so I don't

00:13:29.438 --> 00:13:31.929
know why we are getting tied up over a troll.

00:13:31.929 --> 00:13:33.397
TALIESIN: I feel that as well.

00:13:33.397 --> 00:13:42.311
MARISHA: He definitely has 100 gold on him. Just
saying. Possibly so much more.

00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:43.936
SAM: Let's go check it out.

00:13:43.936 --> 00:13:46.273
LAURA: It's on the way back, anyway.

00:13:46.273 --> 00:13:50.301
TALIESIN: We'll give you the dynamite, and if
anything seems like it goes wrong, you can

00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:53.341
immediately signal Caleb, and we'll bring the
cavalry in.

00:13:53.341 --> 00:13:54.729
SAM: Okay.

00:13:54.729 --> 00:13:58.431
TRAVIS: Caleb, you got that photographic memory.
You remember where those damn daggers are in the trees?

00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:02.210
LIAM: I remember the way. This way.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:07.245
MATT: What is your marching order, if I could
ask?

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:10.052
LIAM: Oh boy. I am right behind whoever's in the
lead.

00:14:10.052 --> 00:14:13.451
MATT: All righty. Who's in the lead, guys?

00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:15.709
TALIESIN and LAURA: Fjord.

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:17.776
ASHLEY: I'll go behind Caleb.

00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:20.232
TALIESIN: I'll go behind Yasha.

00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:22.759
LAURA: I'll go next to Molly.

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:25.179
MARISHA: I'll take up the rear.

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:27.090
MATT: All right. Nott?

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.814
SAM: 30 feet to the right.

00:14:28.814 --> 00:14:32.141
MATT: And Kiri will stay with Jester.

00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:34.500
LAURA: Yeah, she can ride on my shoulders again.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.807
MATT: And Frumpkin?

00:14:35.807 --> 00:14:37.741
LIAM: Frumpkin is scarfing it on my shoulders.

00:14:37.741 --> 00:14:45.569
MATT: Got it. Fjord, does that mean you're leading
through? Who's responsible for navigating?

00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:50.606
LIAM: I'm a couple steps behind Fjord, saying
"that way" once in a while.

00:14:50.606 --> 00:14:52.784
MATT: Make a survival check, please.

00:14:52.784 --> 00:14:54.846
TRAVIS: I'm glad that's you.

00:14:54.846 --> 00:15:01.177
TALIESIN: That's not bad.

00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:02.448
LIAM: That is a 15.

00:15:02.448 --> 00:15:05.295
MATT: Very good!

00:15:05.295 --> 00:15:08.942
MARISHA: You get a gold star, very good!

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:16.936
MATT: You follow the pearl-handled daggers along
the treeline until eventually, you break southward

00:15:16.936 --> 00:15:24.290
to the northern side of the Ounterloch. You
continue to follow it southwestward from your

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:30.280
current position, curving around the outside of
the lake. Eventually, you make your way back to

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:40.133
the treeline where you were before. At one point,
there's a faint shift in the greenery-- looks like

00:15:40.133 --> 00:15:47.119
a vine maybe has moved-- and you, recognizing the
placement of it, manage to stop Fjord from

00:15:47.119 --> 00:15:55.762
stepping into it. As you pull him back, you guys
watch as there is now a cluster of vines at the

00:15:55.762 --> 00:16:01.688
base of one of these trees, and what looks like
thorns on them, appear to be jagged and in rows--

00:16:01.688 --> 00:16:05.668
LAURA: Is it a trap? Or is it organic?

00:16:05.668 --> 00:16:07.339
MATT: You don't know.

00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:12.166
LIAM: I'm sorry, DM, could you say that again
because I was busy rubbing it into Travis that

00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:14.231
Caleb is stronger than Fjord.

00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:16.592
SAM: Vines.

00:16:16.592 --> 00:16:22.029
MATT: You saw a patch of vines that were tangled
at the base of one of these trees that you managed

00:16:22.029 --> 00:16:24.539
to stop Fjord before stepping into the area.

00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:28.671
TALIESIN: Do we recognize these vines and what
kind of plant this is?

00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:30.072
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.693
TALIESIN: We'll see how this goes. No.

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:34.476
MARISHA: Can I do a scan and look around?

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.424
LAURA: Nott, it could be a trap, come look and see
if it's a trap.

00:16:36.424 --> 00:16:37.747
SAM: Okay, I'm coming.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:41.691
MARISHA: Can I do a scan and see if I see anybody
responsible for making the vines move?

00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:43.530
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.544
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:16:45.544 --> 00:16:51.848
MARISHA: Yeah, man, it's pretty bad. Eight. Nope,
ten. Still getting used to my stats.

00:16:51.848 --> 00:16:55.552
MATT: You don't see anybody responsible for that.

00:16:55.552 --> 00:16:58.731
SAM: I will visually inspect it for traps.

00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:01.699
MATT: All right, make an investigation check.

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:03.007
SAM: Nope!

00:17:03.007 --> 00:17:06.022
LIAM: We want the numbers, though.

00:17:06.022 --> 00:17:07.321
SAM: Eight.

00:17:07.321 --> 00:17:14.574
MATT: Does not appear to be trapped. There are no
other cables or lines, you don't see any signs of

00:17:14.574 --> 00:17:18.847
anything else either holding any tautness to it.
They seem slack.

00:17:18.847 --> 00:17:21.640
LAURA: Can I follow the vines along and see where
they're coming from?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.951
MATT: As you look at them, they're just centered
there at the base. They either might be coming out

00:17:26.951 --> 00:17:30.248
from under the tree or part of a plant network
right there.

00:17:30.248 --> 00:17:31.619
TALIESIN: I've got a weird idea.

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:33.077
SAM: Let's walk around them.

00:17:33.077 --> 00:17:38.045
TALIESIN: Everybody back up a bit. I'm going to
take a little bit of my jerky, I'm going to wrap

00:17:38.045 --> 00:17:43.399
it around a ball bearing, make a little baseball
out of it. I'm going to chuck it right into the

00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:44.543
middle of the vines.

00:17:44.543 --> 00:17:46.851
MARISHA: What, no! It's good jerky!

00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:48.224
LAURA: Yeah! Do it!

00:17:48.224 --> 00:17:51.932
MATT: As soon as you hear Beau's words, "It's good
jerky!", you watch as the vines suddenly wrap

00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:59.175
around where it was and begin to coalesce and
twist around it. You watch as they tighten and

00:17:59.175 --> 00:18:03.990
tear and hold there.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.880
TALIESIN: I love camping.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.785
LIAM: Feed me!

00:18:07.785 --> 00:18:12.550
MATT: Then they begin to slowly shift in your
direction. The vines-- (moving noises)

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.448
TRAVIS: Back up!

00:18:14.448 --> 00:18:16.594
LAURA: Oh, no, it's one of those things again,
just go around it!

00:18:16.594 --> 00:18:18.835
MARISHA: Let's just run! We're just going to go.

00:18:18.835 --> 00:18:24.835
MATT: It's not very quick. You watch as this poor
cluster of jagged vines, different than the

00:18:24.835 --> 00:18:33.692
man-trap you'd encountered before, slowly circle
around and eventually give up after you guys very

00:18:33.692 --> 00:18:35.268
easily make your distance.

00:18:35.268 --> 00:18:38.496
LAURA: I throw little bits of moldy pastries at it
because I feel sorry for it.

00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:40.354
MARISHA: Aww, feeding the plants.

00:18:40.354 --> 00:18:41.869
TRAVIS: And it throws it back.

00:18:41.869 --> 00:18:44.058
MATT: Doesn't seem to have much interest in them,
unfortunately.

00:18:44.058 --> 00:18:45.741
LAURA: Well, it's still really good.

00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:47.688
ASHLEY: It'll get hungry. Maybe later.

00:18:47.688 --> 00:18:54.931
MATT: Pressing on, you're heading back to
Berleben, or are you searching for this hollow you

00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:56.236
found before?

00:18:56.236 --> 00:19:00.028
LIAM: I was leading everyone back to where this
troll was.

00:19:00.028 --> 00:19:02.609
MATT: Make another survival check for me, please.

00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:07.531
LIAM: I know exactly the direction of north, and I
remember where we were, that is a nine.

00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:12.647
LAURA: You know we're going to get lost in this
swamp forever.

00:19:12.647 --> 00:19:15.594
LIAM: But I have perfect memory.

00:19:15.594 --> 00:19:20.439
MATT: You have firm memory of directions. You know
which direction you're traveling, and you have--

00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:21.805
LIAM: But it all looks the same.

00:19:21.805 --> 00:19:27.229
MATT: Yeah. You don't have the ability to suddenly
know where everything is that you've been. You

00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:35.311
have a good sense of it, and you can guide better
than most, given most circumstances. But you also

00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:40.689
have not grown up in a swamp, and after a while,
the pattern recognition begins to fade a bit and

00:19:40.689 --> 00:19:46.992
you discover, after you've been circling for a bit,
stumbling upon your own footfalls, you've lost

00:19:46.992 --> 00:19:49.650
about two hours of travel in the middle of the
swamp.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.165
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh, no!

00:19:51.165 --> 00:19:53.169
LIAM: It looks just the way I remembered it
though.

00:19:53.169 --> 00:19:59.096
LAURA: Maybe we circled around for two hours the
first time and we just didn't realize it.

00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:00.772
TALIESIN: That's entirely possible.

00:20:00.772 --> 00:20:07.081
MATT: Knowing that, you do take knowledge of the
current source of sunlight above the canopy.

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:14.351
Following that, heading in the western direction
from where you were, eventually you come across

00:20:14.351 --> 00:20:19.538
that similar sound: distant chimes.

00:20:19.538 --> 00:20:21.369
SAM: What was that?

00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:24.027
LAURA: Those were the bone chimes!

00:20:24.027 --> 00:20:27.290
SAM: Oh no! That's scarier than wind chimes.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.696
LAURA: Should we be stealthy?

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:32.718
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should be stealthy.

00:20:32.718 --> 00:20:35.035
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us?

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:38.147
LIAM and SAM: Yes.

00:20:38.147 --> 00:20:40.166
SAM: Is that all of us?

00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:43.179
LAURA: Yeah. Stay within 30 feet of me, okay?

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:47.982
TRAVIS: Big times are coming, Nott.

00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:51.193
SAM: I don't want to, don't make me go in there.
It's a troll house.

00:20:51.193 --> 00:20:52.234
LAURA: Nott!

00:20:52.234 --> 00:20:53.221
SAM: What?

00:20:53.221 --> 00:20:55.908
LAURA: Bless you. Now you have advantage on
stealth checks.

00:20:55.908 --> 00:20:57.045
SAM: Okay.

00:20:57.045 --> 00:20:58.440
MATT: So are you all staying back?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.319
LAURA: Yeah.

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:01.037
MATT: How far back are you staying?

00:21:01.037 --> 00:21:04.791
MARISHA: Should we do a circle, surround the
perimeter, just in case?

00:21:04.791 --> 00:21:07.326
LAURA: Let's do a semicircle around where the door
is.

00:21:07.326 --> 00:21:10.398
MATT: Here, this will make it easy to establish
the scenario.

00:21:10.398 --> 00:21:12.301
SAM: He's got a map.

00:21:12.301 --> 00:21:14.704
TALIESIN: We remember what not to do, right, which
is--

00:21:14.704 --> 00:21:16.489
SAM: No, what?

00:21:16.489 --> 00:21:20.657
LAURA: Don't attack him up close. Don't let him
get close to us.

00:21:20.657 --> 00:21:23.939
TRAVIS: Yeah guys, distance is key.

00:21:23.939 --> 00:21:26.998
MATT: There is the hollow, with the central tree
there.

00:21:26.998 --> 00:21:29.792
TRAVIS: And we're coming from?

00:21:29.792 --> 00:21:38.149
MATT: You guys are coming this direction, so north
would be that direction. You guys are heading this

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:44.029
way. Where would you guys like to be placed?

00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:46.324
SAM: Semicircle right there?

00:21:46.324 --> 00:21:47.634
LAURA: Yeah.

00:21:47.634 --> 00:21:52.438
LIAM: I would like to be on the absolute side of
the semicircle, please.

00:21:52.438 --> 00:21:55.298
LAURA: Is this rough terrain, is this swampy or is
this normal ground?

00:21:55.298 --> 00:22:00.619
MATT: It's normal ground where it's green and then
rough terrain where it's water.

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:09.321
LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's-- Oh no.

00:22:09.321 --> 00:22:12.364
MATT: Kiri has her dagger out and is currently--

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:14.532
LAURA: Oh no! Kiri, stay behind this tree next to
me.

00:22:14.532 --> 00:22:15.734
MATT: There?

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:18.985
LAURA: No, behind it. Yeah.

00:22:18.985 --> 00:22:23.874
MARISHA: Hiding in that tree.

00:22:23.874 --> 00:22:27.972
ASHLEY: I feel a little exposed.

00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:29.647
SAM: Nott's over there.

00:22:29.647 --> 00:22:36.673
MATT: There you go. As you're preparing yourself,
Kiri looks over to you with a big smile with the

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.121
dagger out and goes (as Jester), "I don't know if
it's smart."

00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:45.216
SAM: Kiri, I don't either. Give me the boomstick.

00:22:45.216 --> 00:22:47.219
LAURA: Who has the boomstick?

00:22:47.219 --> 00:22:48.299
TRAVIS: You do now.

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:49.599
SAM: I have the boomstick.

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:53.302
LAURA: Okay, be stealthy. You have advantage.

00:22:53.302 --> 00:22:56.439
SAM: What am I doing? I'm going to see if this is
the troll's place.

00:22:56.439 --> 00:22:58.277
LAURA: You're going to see if the troll is
inside--

00:22:58.277 --> 00:23:00.597
TALIESIN: You're going to take everything that you
can grab in there.

00:23:00.597 --> 00:23:02.316
ASHLEY: Frumpkin's not going in?

00:23:02.316 --> 00:23:05.169
TRAVIS: It's an unnecessary step. Just blow that
thing up, man!

00:23:05.169 --> 00:23:08.319
LAURA: What if the troll's not in there, though?

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:09.601
TRAVIS: Then you blow it up anyway!

00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:10.835
LAURA: Then we can go steal stuff.

00:23:10.835 --> 00:23:11.969
MARISHA: Do we go steal stuff and bounce?

00:23:11.969 --> 00:23:13.114
TALIESIN: And then blow it up and run.

00:23:13.114 --> 00:23:13.965
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:23:13.965 --> 00:23:15.366
LAURA: So find out if he's in there.

00:23:15.366 --> 00:23:16.407
SAM: All right.

00:23:16.407 --> 00:23:18.118
MARISHA: Wait, is Frumpkin dead? Not to be
insensitive.

00:23:18.118 --> 00:23:19.248
LIAM: You just touched his tail.

00:23:19.248 --> 00:23:20.581
MARISHA: Oh, hey buddy. Sorry.

00:23:20.581 --> 00:23:21.916
LAURA: Maybe he should go in there.

00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:23.149
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe we send Frumpkin first.

00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:28.216
SAM: But Frumpkin's not as-- I mean, yes, that
would be great. But Frumpkin's not as stealthy as

00:23:28.216 --> 00:23:29.248
I am.

00:23:29.248 --> 00:23:30.398
TRAVIS: If you want, I can go.

00:23:30.398 --> 00:23:32.274
LIAM: You cast Pass without a Trace on all of us.

00:23:32.274 --> 00:23:33.302
LAURA: Yeah.

00:23:33.302 --> 00:23:34.348
SAM: I'm okay.

00:23:34.348 --> 00:23:35.876
TALIESIN: But it's only up to 30 feet away from
her.

00:23:35.876 --> 00:23:36.875
LAURA: That's true.

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:37.821
SAM: I have advantage, though.

00:23:37.821 --> 00:23:38.957
LAURA: Okay, go in there, Nott. Do it.

00:23:38.957 --> 00:23:41.219
SAM: I'm going to run up, stealthily.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.160
MATT: Roll your stealth with advantage, Nott, as
you come up along the side.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.504
LIAM: Plus ten.

00:23:45.504 --> 00:23:48.114
SAM and MATT: It's not plus ten.

00:23:48.114 --> 00:23:49.197
LIAM: I thought that--

00:23:49.197 --> 00:23:50.725
LAURA: It has to be within 30 feet.

00:23:50.725 --> 00:23:51.965
SAM: 22.

00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:56.139
MATT: All right.

00:23:56.139 --> 00:23:58.855
LAURA: So Caleb, you've got plus ten right now.

00:23:58.855 --> 00:24:03.785
MATT: As quietly as you can, you turn around the
corner, walk this little swampy land bridge,

00:24:03.785 --> 00:24:09.825
dipping down to about your waist in swamp water,
but in a very slow, steady path, begin to emerge,

00:24:09.825 --> 00:24:17.143
your foot finding the roots at the base of this
large, now hollowed tree. You turn around the

00:24:17.143 --> 00:24:18.157
corner--

00:24:18.157 --> 00:24:20.095
SAM: I'm wearing my Ring of Waterwalking, by the
way.

00:24:20.095 --> 00:24:24.570
MATT: That's true, you do actually. So you (tip
tap) across it. The softest ninja run you've ever

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:29.707
seen. You can almost hear Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairies as you go. Glancing inside, you do see

00:24:29.707 --> 00:24:38.151
currently in the process of chewing something. You
hear a crunching sound, and then a slurping sound,

00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:44.250
and then some subtle (eating noises).

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:49.029
TRAVIS: Smoke that for me!

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:55.434
SAM: I will stealthily back away so there's no way
he can see me. To the side, and I will--

00:24:55.434 --> 00:24:59.781
LAURA: Wait, can we all hold our attacks for as
soon as the troll comes out of the tree?

00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:02.729
MATT: Do you want to hold actions when it comes to
it?

00:25:02.782 --> 00:25:03.822
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:25:03.822 --> 00:25:04.921
MARISHA: Sure.

00:25:04.921 --> 00:25:06.920
TRAVIS: I'll hold Eldritch Blast until he's
visible.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.546
LIAM: I will hold Fire Bolt.

00:25:08.546 --> 00:25:11.714
MARISHA: I'll hold a throwing star.

00:25:11.714 --> 00:25:18.343
MATT: Essentially it would be a surprise round, so
you wouldn't have to worry about holding necessarily.

00:25:18.364 --> 00:25:19.593
LAURA: Okay.

00:25:19.593 --> 00:25:21.719
MATT: He doesn't seem to know you're there.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:27.320
SAM: Am I able to light the boom-boom stick?

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.131
MATT: Do you have flint and steel in your
equipment?

00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:31.426
SAM: I'm looking.

00:25:31.426 --> 00:25:33.570
(laughter)

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.254
TRAVIS: Did we send him out there without
matches?

00:25:35.254 --> 00:25:36.434
ASHLEY: Great idea.

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:49.920
SAM: I have thieves' tools? And I have acid.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.917
LAURA: Well, sneak back here!

00:25:52.917 --> 00:25:58.371
LIAM: I pull out the wire and say, "What are you
doing? Throw it in!"

00:25:58.371 --> 00:26:00.327
SAM: I don't have a match!

00:26:00.327 --> 00:26:06.799
LIAM: Oh. I could light it from here if you just
toss it down and dive.

00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:08.218
SAM: What?

00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:11.468
ASHLEY: I have... I probably can't hear you guys.

00:26:11.468 --> 00:26:14.357
MARISHA: Like, you throw a Fireball and make it
go?

00:26:14.408 --> 00:26:15.737
SAM: I'm going to come back!

00:26:15.737 --> 00:26:16.840
MARISHA: Oh my God!

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.384
MATT: Nott scoots back around the corner. As you
guys are all waiting patiently,

00:26:21.384 --> 00:26:23.402
TRAVIS: How's it look?

00:26:23.402 --> 00:26:26.453
SAM: It's definitely the troll. I just need
someone to light this for me. Or give me a match.

00:26:26.462 --> 00:26:29.159
Or something, or light something on fire.

00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:31.513
LAURA: Just use your thing! Don't you have, like,
Burning Hands or something?

00:26:31.513 --> 00:26:34.074
LIAM: It's hard to control.

00:26:34.074 --> 00:26:37.205
LAURA: Just light a finger on fire and just touch
the thing.

00:26:37.205 --> 00:26:38.325
ASHLEY: I have a tinderbox.

00:26:38.325 --> 00:26:39.311
SAM: Oh, great! Great!

00:26:39.311 --> 00:26:45.025
TRAVIS: But is it a long wick?

00:26:45.025 --> 00:26:46.795
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:46.795 --> 00:26:48.067
MATT: It's about that long.

00:26:48.067 --> 00:26:48.971
TRAVIS: Oh, geez!

00:26:48.971 --> 00:26:52.478
MATT: Make an intelligence check, actually.

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:54.318
LAURA: You could run and do it.

00:26:54.318 --> 00:26:56.091
SAM: Intelligence? Eight plus something.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.521
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

00:26:57.521 --> 00:27:01.079
SAM: Intelligence check. 11?

00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:09.665
MATT: 11? You have some understanding of basic
alchemy; you know probably the way this is treated

00:27:09.722 --> 00:27:17.890
it won't burn super fast. You're not sure. You
could have anywhere between 24 to six seconds once lit.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.043
TRAVIS: This is such a drunk Fourth of July problem.

00:27:20.099 --> 00:27:24.222
TALIESIN: You have full running speed, though.

00:27:24.222 --> 00:27:25.283
TRAVIS: Jester!

00:27:25.283 --> 00:27:26.135
LAURA: What?

00:27:26.135 --> 00:27:26.986
TRAVIS: Go with him!

00:27:26.986 --> 00:27:27.735
LAURA: Why?

00:27:27.735 --> 00:27:29.188
TRAVIS: You've got Pass Without Trace, just go
with him!

00:27:29.188 --> 00:27:30.660
LAURA: Why do you want me to die?

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.412
MARISHA: It'll look really cool when you're
running away from it, though, when it's exploding.

00:27:34.412 --> 00:27:39.627
LAURA: You're right, it will! Okay, I'm gonna
follow 30 feet behind Nott as we're going up.

00:27:39.627 --> 00:27:41.197
(laughter)

00:27:41.197 --> 00:27:43.159
SAM: Okay, I'm going to cast Mage Hand to hold the
dynamite.

00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:44.382
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

00:27:44.382 --> 00:27:47.148
SAM: Okay, so Mage Hand is holding the dynamite.
Go ahead and light it, Yasha.

00:27:47.148 --> 00:27:50.390
MATT: Wait, so where are you, then?

00:27:50.436 --> 00:27:51.862
SAM: I am near Yasha.

00:27:51.862 --> 00:27:53.435
MATT: Okay, so you move over.

00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:55.353
TALIESIN: I'm going to get behind that tree and
activate my swords.

00:27:55.353 --> 00:27:57.070
LAURA: I'm going to get within 30 feet of Nott.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.816
MATT: Both swords ignited.

00:27:58.816 --> 00:27:59.914
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

00:27:59.914 --> 00:28:01.253
LAURA: And I'm within 30 feet of Nott.

00:28:01.253 --> 00:28:02.515
MATT: So you move over here with Yasha, then?

00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:03.713
LAURA: Sure, I guess?

00:28:03.713 --> 00:28:09.182
MATT: Okay, there's now this floating piece of
dynamite just kind of gliding over the swamp. You

00:28:09.182 --> 00:28:16.560
hear the insects buzzing and various dragonflies
making their way through. So you have it now floating

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.953
in front of you, Yasha.

00:28:18.008 --> 00:28:19.864
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll light it.

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:22.486
MATT: It's going!

00:28:22.486 --> 00:28:26.802
SAM: Okay! I'm going to move toward the thing and
make Mage Hand go in front of me all the way into

00:28:26.802 --> 00:28:28.198
the hole.

00:28:28.198 --> 00:28:31.513
MATT: Okay. You get right around this corner. Make
another stealth check as you've now dilly-dallied

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.662
around for a bit.

00:28:32.662 --> 00:28:34.039
LAURA: Oh, that's good, you still have advantage.

00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:35.525
SAM: Okay. 25.

00:28:35.525 --> 00:28:36.795
MATT: Okay.

00:28:36.795 --> 00:28:38.618
MARISHA: And you're within 30 feet, right?

00:28:38.618 --> 00:28:39.894
LAURA: Oh! And plus ten!

00:28:39.894 --> 00:28:41.073
SAM: 35!

00:28:41.073 --> 00:28:49.335
MATT: No idea you're there. But there is a faint
(hissing) sound and from the inside you see the

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:54.036
shifting movement of the large hulking troll beast
on the inside of the hollow kind of pause for a

00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:55.770
second in the middle of chewing.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.653
SAM: The mage hand is going in!

00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:01.006
MATT: Silence.

00:29:01.006 --> 00:29:03.526
LAURA: But I--

00:29:03.526 --> 00:29:04.811
SAM: What did you do?

00:29:04.811 --> 00:29:06.075
(massive explosion)

00:29:06.075 --> 00:29:09.282
MATT: If I could get a pair of scissors, please.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.352
SAM: What? You're going to cut your beautiful
work?

00:29:11.352 --> 00:29:13.380
MATT: Well yeah, you blew it apart!

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:21.904
(laughter, cheering)

00:29:21.904 --> 00:29:23.482
MATT: Thank you kindly.

00:29:23.482 --> 00:29:26.361
TRAVIS: Look, it's got roots and all sorts of
beautiful things.

00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:31.170
LIAM: "If I could get a pair of scissors,
please?"

00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:33.978
SAM: Should we start bringing cherry bombs?

00:29:34.049 --> 00:29:36.488
LAURA: Attack, attack, attack!

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:37.923
MATT: Okay, so first off--

00:29:37.923 --> 00:29:39.296
MARISHA: That was the coolest!

00:29:39.296 --> 00:29:45.038
MATT: Disadvantage on its dexterity saving throw;
fails. Go ahead and roll 2d6 for me please.

00:29:45.038 --> 00:29:46.521
SAM: Me? Okay.

00:29:46.617 --> 00:29:49.171
LAURA: That's only 2d6 of damage? Oh no!

00:29:49.227 --> 00:29:50.335
SAM: Double ones.

00:29:50.335 --> 00:29:52.609
(laughter)

00:29:52.609 --> 00:29:55.662
LIAM: Ooh, that's some stale dynamite.

00:29:55.662 --> 00:29:57.869
TALIESIN: That was a bottle rocket.

00:29:57.869 --> 00:30:06.403
MATT: A concussive blast blows apart the hollow.
You see pieces of shrapnel go flying in every

00:30:06.403 --> 00:30:09.249
direction. The only one who is not currently
protected is you, Nott. I need you to make a

00:30:09.249 --> 00:30:10.614
dexterity saving throw, please.

00:30:10.614 --> 00:30:12.220
SAM: On my own blast?

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.795
MATT: Well, not from the blast. This is from the
shrapnel of the tree hollow that has exploded

00:30:15.795 --> 00:30:17.795
outwards in all directions.

00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:19.181
TRAVIS: I'm unprotected.

00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:20.923
MATT: You're far enough away where I don't think
it would get to you.

00:30:20.923 --> 00:30:22.895
SAM: 11.

00:30:22.952 --> 00:30:27.081
MATT: That's okay. You take half damage.

00:30:27.081 --> 00:30:30.042
LAURA: If you take so much more--

00:30:30.042 --> 00:30:37.119
MATT: You take three points of bludgeoning damage
from pieces of wood flying in your direction. The

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:40.922
troll is, however, knocked prone.

00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:43.173
(cheering)

00:30:43.173 --> 00:30:45.517
TALIESIN: He's harder to hit from a distance, at
the moment.

00:30:45.622 --> 00:30:52.518
MATT: From a distance, yeah. However, I need
everyone to roll initiative.

00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:58.021
SAM: We did this to ourselves.

00:30:58.021 --> 00:31:00.755
LIAM: Yes! Natural 20!

00:31:00.755 --> 00:31:02.578
MATT: He's aware that you guys are there now.

00:31:02.578 --> 00:31:04.125
MARISHA: You think?

00:31:04.125 --> 00:31:11.106
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, I'll give
you each one action to do something.

00:31:11.106 --> 00:31:12.329
LAURA: Okay.

00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:14.348
SAM: Not me, I did my action.

00:31:14.348 --> 00:31:20.796
LIAM: I like that the blast didn't knock him down.
He was just so scared to death. He went, "Ah!"

00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:23.513
MATT: 25 to 20?

00:31:23.513 --> 00:31:25.057
LIAM: 21.

00:31:25.057 --> 00:31:26.317
SAM: 20.

00:31:26.317 --> 00:31:32.021
MATT: A natural 20 on his-- Sorry, Caleb was?

00:31:32.021 --> 00:31:33.664
LIAM: 21.

00:31:33.664 --> 00:31:35.703
MATT: And Nott, was it?

00:31:35.703 --> 00:31:39.779
SAM: 20. Where's that music, Matt?

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:42.147
TRAVIS: I just want to know yours first
all the time.

00:31:42.196 --> 00:31:43.751
ASHLEY: What?

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.426
TRAVIS: I want to know what you rolled.

00:31:45.838 --> 00:31:47.538
ASHLEY: Mine is like, two!

00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:49.016
MATT: 20 to 15?

00:31:49.089 --> 00:31:50.226
TALIESIN: 19.

00:31:50.226 --> 00:31:51.764
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

00:31:51.764 --> 00:31:53.474
MATT: 15 to ten?

00:31:53.474 --> 00:31:54.541
MARISHA: 14.

00:31:54.541 --> 00:31:55.646
TRAVIS: There you go, come on.

00:31:55.646 --> 00:31:59.058
ASHLEY: 12. Moving on up!

00:31:59.058 --> 00:32:01.810
MATT: Ten to five?

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.262
LAURA: Seven.

00:32:03.262 --> 00:32:06.379
MATT: What you got, Fjord?

00:32:06.379 --> 00:32:08.156
TRAVIS: Fjord got a four.

00:32:08.156 --> 00:32:09.446
SAM: A fjour.

00:32:09.446 --> 00:32:12.101
MARISHA: A fjour by Fjord.

00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:17.771
MATT: I think this is a surprise round. The troll
cannot act this turn. We'll just let it go that

00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:22.116
way, because he'd be going up with you, Caleb, on
the same turn. He's on the ground, dazed and

00:32:22.116 --> 00:32:23.925
stunned. What are you doing?

00:32:23.925 --> 00:32:28.663
LIAM: A Firebolt goes from my hand. That is a
natural 20.

00:32:28.663 --> 00:32:33.095
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on now!

00:32:33.095 --> 00:32:42.297
LIAM: With my Vax die, we will use this one. That
is a three-- 11. Doubled is 22.

00:32:42.297 --> 00:32:50.365
MATT: 22 points of fire damage. Nice. The bolt
impacts, the flame curls across his now currently

00:32:50.365 --> 00:32:58.669
black, blasted chest and back area. The flames, as
you noticed in a previous battle, has prevented

00:32:58.669 --> 00:33:00.122
its regeneration.

00:33:00.122 --> 00:33:03.623
LIAM: I didn't actually even want to come here.
Ah!

00:33:03.623 --> 00:33:05.512
ASHLEY: He can regenerate?

00:33:05.512 --> 00:33:07.879
LAURA: He can't; he's burned.

00:33:07.879 --> 00:33:09.317
MARISHA: They do normally, though.

00:33:09.317 --> 00:33:10.402
TRAVIS: Fire!

00:33:10.402 --> 00:33:12.519
MATT: From the battles you've had and from
watching the previous strike, you now notice the

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:17.143
impact, and as the time progresses over the next
round, the wounds are not knitting themselves back

00:33:17.143 --> 00:33:19.354
together. So, that finishes your turn. Are you
going to move?

00:33:19.354 --> 00:33:21.050
LIAM: No. I'll stay where I am.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.494
MATT: Finishing Caleb's go. Nott, you're up.

00:33:23.494 --> 00:33:28.168
SAM: Okay, I'll shoot my crossbow and miss, with a
nine.

00:33:28.168 --> 00:33:30.522
MATT: You have disadvantage because he's currently
prone.

00:33:30.522 --> 00:33:32.919
SAM: Disadvantage? I already missed.

00:33:32.919 --> 00:33:34.735
MATT: I just wanted to see if you rolled lower.

00:33:34.735 --> 00:33:35.807
SAM: Still nine.

00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:38.240
MATT: Good to know. First shot misses.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.550
SAM: Oh, I get another one?

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.565
MATT: I'm letting you guys have a full surprise
round, because technically he's dazed.

00:33:41.565 --> 00:33:46.014
SAM: Oh, that's no good. 13?

00:33:46.014 --> 00:33:48.686
MATT: 13 does not hit.

00:33:48.686 --> 00:33:50.348
LAURA: Oh no!

00:33:50.348 --> 00:33:53.600
MATT: It manages to ricochet off of the outer
parts of its hide. Even though it's burnt and

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.928
scarred, it's still thick. You watch as the bolt
reflects off it. Molly, you're up and then Beau.

00:33:58.928 --> 00:34:05.266
TALIESIN: I'm going to come out from behind my
tree right there, just a little bit so I can see

00:34:05.266 --> 00:34:10.792
him. I'm going to try and Enthrall him, because I
don't have any good stuff that I can do from a

00:34:10.792 --> 00:34:12.128
distance.

00:34:12.128 --> 00:34:13.970
LAURA and TALIESIN: (singing) From a distance!

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:17.979
MATT: Spell DC on that is charisma-based, so it's
a ten, correct?

00:34:17.979 --> 00:34:19.696
TALIESIN: Is it charisma-based? That's right.

00:34:19.696 --> 00:34:21.080
MATT: All of your racial abilities are
charisma-based.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.479
TALIESIN: Because it says wisdom I get so--

00:34:22.479 --> 00:34:26.433
MATT: That is a 12, so it does not succeed.

00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:28.754
TALIESIN: It does not succeed?

00:34:28.754 --> 00:34:29.850
MATT: No, sorry, I mean--

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:30.889
TALIESIN: It does succeed.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:34.321
MATT: Meaning your ability does not succeed.
That's your action. You still have 25 feet of

00:34:34.321 --> 00:34:35.740
movement if you want do anything.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.842
TALIESIN: I'm actually going to sort of stand out
in the-- I'm going to move a couple feet out--

00:34:40.842 --> 00:34:46.510
there. And just start yelling at him: Hey-- hey
you fucker, you got-- We got more than that! Where

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.962
we-- Come on! Bring it! I don't know what I'm
doing! Too much caffeine!

00:34:50.962 --> 00:34:52.503
MATT: Perfect.

00:34:52.503 --> 00:34:55.215
TRAVIS: The wires crossed!

00:34:55.215 --> 00:34:58.094
TALIESIN: That all happened in there. That all
happened.

00:34:58.094 --> 00:35:02.185
MATT: That finishes Molly's turn. Beau, you're
up.

00:35:02.185 --> 00:35:04.160
TALIESIN: Good thing nobody in the world saw
that.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:10.602
MARISHA: I'm going to move up my speed pretty far,
because I think I have to be within 20 feet for

00:35:10.602 --> 00:35:11.828
these darts.

00:35:11.828 --> 00:35:18.647
MATT: Keeping on the green, you can get about
there, and he is within 20 feet of you.

00:35:18.707 --> 00:35:22.391
LAURA: Can you not get within close range of him
again?

00:35:22.391 --> 00:35:23.609
MARISHA: I'm not!

00:35:23.609 --> 00:35:25.140
TRAVIS: You are just inching up.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:31.234
MARISHA: I have throwing darts that only go 20
feet, and I'm a melee fighter, man!

00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:33.887
TRAVIS: He stole you last time. You should have
PTSD from this.

00:35:33.887 --> 00:35:36.144
MARISHA: Have you met Beau?

00:35:36.144 --> 00:35:37.389
TRAVIS: You're right.

00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:40.352
MATT: You have disadvantage on the attacks,
because he's prone.

00:35:40.352 --> 00:35:45.947
MARISHA: Oh right, okay. First attack. 19.

00:35:45.947 --> 00:35:47.160
MATT: 19 hits!

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:55.777
MARISHA: On the first one. We celebrated too soon.
A natural 20 and a seven! So 14.

00:35:55.777 --> 00:35:58.145
MATT: 14 misses, unfortunately, but the first
strike does hit.

00:35:58.145 --> 00:36:01.483
LIAM: Get up there and grapple him, and I'll send
projectiles.

00:36:01.483 --> 00:36:04.116
MARISHA: That sucks. Four damage.

00:36:04.116 --> 00:36:06.342
MATT: Four points of damage to the troll.

00:36:06.342 --> 00:36:08.077
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point--

00:36:08.077 --> 00:36:11.669
MATT: As you throw it, you watch as it splinters
off of its body and there is a splash of poisonous

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:12.809
toxin.

00:36:12.809 --> 00:36:15.458
MARISHA: Like a rock in his face!

00:36:15.458 --> 00:36:17.149
TRAVIS: Yep, like a pebble.

00:36:17.149 --> 00:36:21.155
MARISHA: Like a pebble! I'm going to use a ki
point to do Patient Defense.

00:36:21.155 --> 00:36:23.851
MATT: All right, you go into your defensive
stance, preparing for any sort of assault towards

00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:25.180
you. Yasha, you're up.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.786
MARISHA: Did I go my full speed?

00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:29.010
MATT: No, you didn't.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.379
MARISHA: Can I move back a little?

00:36:30.379 --> 00:36:31.636
MATT: If you want to, yeah.

00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:34.971
MARISHA: One more, that's good.

00:36:34.971 --> 00:36:36.518
MATT: All right, there you go. Yasha.

00:36:36.518 --> 00:36:43.614
ASHLEY: I don't want to move close to it. May I
hold my action until it gets--

00:36:43.614 --> 00:36:47.090
LAURA: This is a surprise attack, though.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:50.922
ASHLEY: I know it's a surprise attack, I just
don't have any ranged weapons or anything. I can

00:36:50.922 --> 00:36:52.684
go up and hit him.

00:36:52.684 --> 00:36:57.620
MATT: It's up to you. If you don't move, you don't
get to move later until your next turn. So if

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.592
you're going to move, do it now, and then hold
your action for whatever trigger you want.

00:37:00.592 --> 00:37:05.507
ASHLEY: Okay, let me move around by Beau.

00:37:05.507 --> 00:37:07.026
MATT: Over here?

00:37:07.026 --> 00:37:09.581
ASHLEY: Yeah, next to Beau.

00:37:09.581 --> 00:37:11.320
MATT: And you're holding an attack?

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.421
ASHLEY: I'm holding an attack.

00:37:12.421 --> 00:37:16.699
MATT: Okay, you are readying an attack, for what?
What's the trigger? Comes within range? Got it.

00:37:16.699 --> 00:37:18.537
Okay, that finishes Yasha's turn. Jester, you're
up.

00:37:18.537 --> 00:37:24.477
LAURA: That's me! I'm going to cast Spiritual
Weapon right above it!

00:37:24.477 --> 00:37:26.432
MATT: Right above it!

00:37:26.432 --> 00:37:32.278
LAURA: And it's going to hit him!

00:37:32.278 --> 00:37:35.646
MATT: All right, roll for your attack.

00:37:35.646 --> 00:37:37.787
LAURA: It's not at disadvantage, because it's
melee, right?

00:37:37.787 --> 00:37:43.065
MATT: Correct. Technically it's at advantage,
because it is prone. I imagine it's considered a

00:37:43.065 --> 00:37:44.531
melee attack.

00:37:44.531 --> 00:37:46.699
TALIESIN and LAURA: Ooh!

00:37:46.699 --> 00:37:49.516
LAURA: 19 plus something, so that definitely
hits.

00:37:49.516 --> 00:37:51.488
MATT: That definitely hits, roll damage on that.

00:37:51.488 --> 00:37:57.005
LAURA: That's 1d8, because I did it wrong before.
That's five plus seven.

00:37:57.005 --> 00:38:03.985
MATT: 12 points of damage as the lollipop (whack)
slams down onto its body. It rears back. This

00:38:03.985 --> 00:38:08.968
awkward, sickly looking creature being bashed by
beautiful, glistening, divine lollipop. It's a

00:38:08.968 --> 00:38:10.340
unique visual.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:18.483
LAURA: Eat it, troll! Then I am going to use my
bonus action to ring a spiritual bell and Toll the Dead!

00:38:18.483 --> 00:38:21.257
MATT: You mean you used your bonus action for the
Spirit, and your action for the--

00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:25.837
LAURA: Yes, that's what I mean! He's got to make a
wisdom save of 15.

00:38:25.837 --> 00:38:30.891
MATT: Wisdom or constitution? Wisdom, all right.
That is a four.

00:38:30.891 --> 00:38:33.484
LAURA: Yeah! So that's 2d12!

00:38:33.484 --> 00:38:34.762
MATT: Yeah it is!

00:38:34.762 --> 00:38:36.153
TRAVIS: Rock it!

00:38:36.153 --> 00:38:38.938
LAURA: Ooh! 14!

00:38:38.938 --> 00:38:41.129
MARISHA: Making up for last week!

00:38:41.129 --> 00:38:44.216
MATT: Apparently. All righty, that ends Jester's
go.

00:38:44.216 --> 00:38:48.026
LAURA: I'm going to stay right there.

00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:49.894
MATT: All righty, Fjord, you're up.

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:58.693
TRAVIS: I'll move forward ten feet, and, with my
bonus action, cast Hex on him for strength checks.

00:38:58.693 --> 00:39:02.191
MATT: All righty, strength checks are denied onto
him for disadvantage.

00:39:02.191 --> 00:39:04.254
TRAVIS: Denied, and I'll launch two Eldritch
Blasts in his direction.

00:39:04.254 --> 00:39:06.323
MATT: Go for it, both at disadvantage.

00:39:06.323 --> 00:39:09.285
TRAVIS: That's a ten on the first; that's going to
miss.

00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:10.532
MATT: Misses over top.

00:39:10.532 --> 00:39:13.274
TRAVIS: And 19 to hit.

00:39:13.274 --> 00:39:15.491
MATT: That does hit, roll damage.

00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:25.012
TRAVIS: Seven! Seven points of damage! Wait, and a
d6.

00:39:25.012 --> 00:39:27.874
MATT: A d6 from your Hex, don't forget that.

00:39:27.874 --> 00:39:31.114
TRAVIS: Another four, total of ten.

00:39:31.114 --> 00:39:33.355
MATT: 11, technically.

00:39:33.355 --> 00:39:34.695
ASHLEY: Is he looking rough?

00:39:34.695 --> 00:39:35.967
LAURA: He's looking pretty rough.

00:39:35.967 --> 00:39:41.254
MATT: No, he's all right. I mean, he looks hurt.
Top of the round, Caleb and the troll going at the

00:39:41.254 --> 00:39:45.698
same time. Because you are going at the same time
with the enemy, roll a dexterity check. Roll a

00:39:45.698 --> 00:39:47.484
d20, add your dexterity modifier.

00:39:47.484 --> 00:39:51.244
LIAM: It's pretty high, I reckon. Nope, that is a
seven.

00:39:51.244 --> 00:39:57.651
MATT: He's going before you. Gets up in its space,
that's half his movement.

00:39:57.651 --> 00:39:59.548
LAURA: Ooh, he's so ugly!

00:39:59.548 --> 00:40:04.910
MATT: (counting) 15.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.033
MARISHA: Ha ha ha!

00:40:07.033 --> 00:40:08.305
LAURA: Don't laugh yet.

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:10.795
MATT: It's going to use an action to dash forward
in front of you.

00:40:10.795 --> 00:40:12.712
SAM AND LAURA: Oh no!

00:40:12.712 --> 00:40:14.465
LAURA: Run away.

00:40:14.465 --> 00:40:17.952
TRAVIS: Oh, we can't fucking hit him.

00:40:17.952 --> 00:40:19.991
LAURA: We can't attack him until you guys move.

00:40:20.179 --> 00:40:24.368
MATT: You know what? He's not. He's going to stay
there, and instead he's going to go ahead and use

00:40:24.426 --> 00:40:33.541
his venom spray. It lumbers forward, it's
darkened, with angry, blasted soot and flame

00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:40.013
scars, it rumbles toward you, its strange bulbous
midsection wobbling as it steps through the swamp

00:40:40.013 --> 00:40:46.924
towards you. It looks like an even more swollen
Meg Mucklebones from Legend. Reaches up with its

00:40:46.924 --> 00:40:55.109
claw and tears a giant wound across its chest. As
it does, dark green venomous liquid sprays out in

00:40:55.109 --> 00:41:00.338
a 15-foot cube in front of it, hitting both of
you. I need you both to make a constitution saving

00:41:00.338 --> 00:41:04.097
throw, please. It takes seven points of damage
from its own claw.

00:41:04.097 --> 00:41:06.339
TRAVIS: We had to have 100 gold, didn't we?

00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:08.900
MARISHA: Does my Patient Defense do anything
here?

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.846
LAURA: This is not about the gold, Fjord!

00:41:10.846 --> 00:41:13.101
MARISHA: 16.

00:41:13.101 --> 00:41:14.742
LAURA: This is a reckoning!

00:41:14.742 --> 00:41:17.340
ASHLEY: Just a straight roll, yeah? 11.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.858
MATT: Okay, you just make it. The DC was 16.

00:41:19.858 --> 00:41:24.188
TRAVIS: Hah. You're like, I made it.

00:41:24.188 --> 00:41:30.818
ASHLEY: I made it. You're telling me there's a
chance.

00:41:30.818 --> 00:41:40.616
MATT: That is exactly what you needed. 18 points
of poison damage to you, Yasha, and you are

00:41:40.616 --> 00:41:42.231
poisoned for one minute.

00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:44.455
SAM and LAURA: Oh no.

00:41:44.455 --> 00:41:48.489
MATT: You take nine points of poison damage, Beau,
and you are not poisoned.

00:41:48.489 --> 00:41:53.544
TALIESIN: But you can save against that, right?
Every turn?

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:56.215
MATT: Yep. At the end of each turn, you can repeat
the saving throw to try and get rid of the poison,

00:41:56.215 --> 00:42:00.165
so that's going to end its turn. Next, Caleb.

00:42:00.165 --> 00:42:03.899
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so I'm going to keep it simple.
I will move as close as I can, probably getting

00:42:03.899 --> 00:42:05.656
close to Mollymauk.

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:07.511
MATT: Right there?

00:42:07.511 --> 00:42:17.664
LIAM: Ja. I will hit him with some Magic M-- No.
Is he within splashing range of you all? Did you

00:42:17.664 --> 00:42:19.038
just get hit?

00:42:19.038 --> 00:42:20.453
TRAVIS: No, not with blood spray.

00:42:20.453 --> 00:42:22.478
LIAM: I'll hit him with Magic Missile.

00:42:22.478 --> 00:42:23.797
MATT: What level?

00:42:23.797 --> 00:42:25.108
LIAM: The basic level.

00:42:25.108 --> 00:42:29.908
MATT: Three missiles. 3d4 plus three, go ahead and
roll that up. Nott, you're up next.

00:42:29.908 --> 00:42:44.388
LIAM: Three, four, eight. 11 total.

00:42:44.388 --> 00:42:50.889
MATT: Finishing that, Caleb, your turn's over.
Nott, what are you doing?

00:42:50.889 --> 00:42:55.288
SAM: I will fire once. Am I at disadvantage or
anything?

00:42:55.288 --> 00:42:56.293
MATT: Nope.

00:42:56.293 --> 00:42:57.934
SAM: Oh, I still missed. 11.

00:42:57.934 --> 00:42:59.486
MATT: That does miss, unfortunately.

00:42:59.486 --> 00:43:01.896
TALIESIN: Are we seeing sprays when he gets hit by
these things, by the way?

00:43:01.896 --> 00:43:09.776
MATT: Each Magic Missile, the spray is still
jumping off of its body in these very

00:43:09.776 --> 00:43:13.157
proximity-based sprays of terrible toxin. So yeah,
it's still happening.

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:18.049
SAM: Can I scoot back behind that tree to the
west?

00:43:18.049 --> 00:43:19.875
MATT: Are you only making the one attack?

00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:21.288
SAM: I'll make another one when I get over there.

00:43:21.288 --> 00:43:22.542
MATT: Over here?

00:43:22.542 --> 00:43:25.930
SAM: Can I go farther around? Just as far around
as I can-- yeah.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:27.282
MATT: As you're rushing past.

00:43:27.282 --> 00:43:33.871
SAM: That one hits. 19 plus something. This
is not a sneak attack, though.

00:43:33.871 --> 00:43:35.381
MATT: Correct.

00:43:35.381 --> 00:43:38.994
SAM: Well, poo. Six points of damage.

00:43:38.994 --> 00:43:42.614
MATT: Six points of damage to it. As the bolt
sticks in the back, you watch as one of its

00:43:42.614 --> 00:43:46.990
bulbous pustules sprays venom behind it, impacting
nothing in its proximity.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.341
LAURA: How far does it look like the pustules
spray?

00:43:49.341 --> 00:43:53.680
MATT: Between five and ten feet, you're not
entirely certain from your visible standpoint,

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:59.880
because you're kneeling behind a tree with partial
cover. That finishes Nott's turn. Molly, you're

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.472
up. Then Beau, you're on deck.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:05.694
TALIESIN: How far can I move in one?

00:44:05.694 --> 00:44:07.435
MATT: 30 feet.

00:44:07.435 --> 00:44:13.970
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to head in the direction
of this creature. I'm going to stay about--

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:22.265
Actually, let's try something ridiculous. You took
a lot of damage from that spray, right?

00:44:22.265 --> 00:44:25.219
MARISHA: Nine. Not as much as Yasha.

00:44:25.219 --> 00:44:33.529
TALIESIN: This'll be fun. Let's run up to it, see
how close I can get.

00:44:33.529 --> 00:44:37.735
MATT: In order to make it with your distance,
you're going to have to leap across that bit of

00:44:37.735 --> 00:44:39.176
open swamp water.

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:42.936
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to leap at that just
north of me to see if I can get over here, then.

00:44:42.936 --> 00:44:45.749
By that spiritual weapon. If I can leap there.

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:51.066
MATT: That'll be the rest of your movement. You'll
be right there and that'll be the end of your

00:44:51.066 --> 00:44:52.592
movement.

00:44:52.592 --> 00:44:57.534
TALIESIN: That's fine. At least it'll hopefully
give everybody some flanking.

00:44:57.534 --> 00:44:59.367
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

00:44:59.367 --> 00:45:04.940
TALIESIN: That's a four.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:18.061
MATT: (counting) You trip and fall down to your
knees in the water. 20, 25, and that's about as

00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:19.664
far as you can move on this turn.

00:45:19.664 --> 00:45:20.807
TALIESIN: That's as far as I can move?

00:45:20.807 --> 00:45:22.062
MATT: You can use an action to dash if you want.

00:45:22.062 --> 00:45:23.941
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my action in case he
comes within fighting distance.

00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:25.250
MATT: Okay, you're holding your attack?

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.468
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm holding my attack.

00:45:26.468 --> 00:45:27.527
MATT: Got it.

00:45:27.527 --> 00:45:34.007
TALIESIN: Can I do anything with my bonus? I can't
do anything with my bonus.

00:45:34.007 --> 00:45:35.509
MATT: Okay. Does that end your turn?

00:45:35.509 --> 00:45:37.254
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think that ends my turn.

00:45:37.254 --> 00:45:38.632
MATT: Beau, you're up.

00:45:38.632 --> 00:45:41.158
MARISHA: I look at Yasha. Yeah?

00:45:41.158 --> 00:45:42.292
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:45:42.292 --> 00:45:53.816
MARISHA: I pull out my oil flask and I undo it and
I douse him with oil, power-of-Christ-compels-you style.

00:45:53.864 --> 00:45:59.319
MATT: Your first attempt to spray it, it
dissipates in front of you.

00:45:59.319 --> 00:46:00.863
LAURA: Throw it at him!

00:46:00.863 --> 00:46:06.743
MATT: You can't throw it 15 feet to land on his
body. You have to throw the actual-- All right.

00:46:06.743 --> 00:46:09.836
Roll a d20 plus your dexterity modifier.

00:46:09.836 --> 00:46:17.331
LAURA: It's 15 feet away.

00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:18.713
MARISHA: Eight.

00:46:18.713 --> 00:46:20.275
LAURA: Oh no!

00:46:20.275 --> 00:46:25.332
MATT: It sees it coming towards it and
(whooshing) past its head, and you hear it

00:46:25.332 --> 00:46:30.222
(shattering) somewhere in the distance. You glance
past it, and there's a pile of skulls and bones

00:46:30.222 --> 00:46:35.144
that were previously charred from the impact that
currently now are doused in oil.

00:46:35.144 --> 00:46:40.364
MARISHA: That didn't go as planned. Sorry.

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:41.575
ASHLEY: Do you want to move?

00:46:41.575 --> 00:46:43.042
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to step back.

00:46:43.042 --> 00:46:46.371
TRAVIS: Run. (singing) Sail away, sail away, sail
away.

00:46:46.371 --> 00:46:49.306
MATT: How much, full movement?

00:46:49.357 --> 00:46:51.368
LAURA: As far as you can. Get as far as you can!

00:46:51.368 --> 00:46:55.850
MARISHA: Yeah, a little bit more. I'm going to go
behind that tree there. Yep, that's fine.

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:58.891
MATT: All right. That ends Beau's turn. End of
Beau. Yasha, you're up.

00:46:58.891 --> 00:47:04.700
ASHLEY: Okay. I know we can't go up and slash, and
that's all I can do, but can I--

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.109
MATT: You can.

00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:08.475
TALIESIN: You're just going to take damage.

00:47:08.475 --> 00:47:10.303
ASHLEY: I can't do it. I'll just take damage. I'm
already low.

00:47:10.303 --> 00:47:15.182
TALIESIN: We healed up. We got a long rest.

00:47:15.182 --> 00:47:23.835
ASHLEY: Yeah. I know. I'm already nervous. Could I
take a torch and throw it at him?

00:47:23.835 --> 00:47:26.684
MATT: Sure, I'll let you do that. Yeah.

00:47:26.684 --> 00:47:29.676
MARISHA: Maybe there's some oil flecks on him.

00:47:29.676 --> 00:47:34.394
MATT: You, who are still holding your tinder box
from lighting the dynamite earlier, pull out your

00:47:34.394 --> 00:47:39.611
pack, pull out a torch, and it begins to burn.
Roll a d20; add your dexterity modifier.

00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:42.710
LAURA: Roll better than Beau!

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.259
MARISHA: Do better than me!

00:47:44.259 --> 00:47:47.806
ASHLEY: Oh no. Seven.

00:47:47.806 --> 00:47:49.206
MARISHA: Damn it!

00:47:49.206 --> 00:47:51.090
SAM: Does it at least land where the oil landed?

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:59.492
MATT: It does! You see behind, a pile of freshly
dampened, oil-covered skulls burns like a nice

00:47:59.544 --> 00:48:01.664
little bonfire behind him.

00:48:01.664 --> 00:48:03.138
ASHLEY: Is he looking at it?

00:48:03.138 --> 00:48:06.425
MATT: It looks at it, and looks back at you about
as incredulously as a troll can, like--

00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:12.357
ASHLEY: I'm going to go back as far as I can.

00:48:12.357 --> 00:48:15.024
MATT: I should have actually rolled at disadvantage
on that, but it would have been the same.

00:48:15.024 --> 00:48:16.837
MARISHA: We still would have sucked.

00:48:16.837 --> 00:48:18.526
ASHLEY: Still would have been shit.

00:48:18.526 --> 00:48:21.268
TALIESIN: There is a tiny burning fire there now.

00:48:21.268 --> 00:48:23.396
ASHLEY: I roll for a save on the poison?

00:48:23.396 --> 00:48:25.535
MATT: You do, at the end of your turn. Make a
constitution saving throw.

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:28.895
MARISHA: That would have been really cool in
theory.

00:48:28.895 --> 00:48:30.413
TALIESIN: It would have been.

00:48:30.413 --> 00:48:31.537
ASHLEY: 17.

00:48:31.537 --> 00:48:33.445
MATT: You manage to shrug off the poison.

00:48:33.445 --> 00:48:34.891
ASHLEY: Good call.

00:48:34.891 --> 00:48:38.611
MATT: Good. All right, that ends Yasha's turn.
Jester, you're up.

00:48:38.611 --> 00:48:46.031
LAURA: From out of the flames comes the spiritual
weapon from behind and it's going to come up and

00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:48.671
spank him on the butt.

00:48:48.671 --> 00:48:50.437
MARISHA: Heavy metal lollipop.

00:48:50.437 --> 00:48:52.085
ASHLEY: Come on, lollipop.

00:48:52.085 --> 00:48:53.536
LAURA: 14.

00:48:53.536 --> 00:48:59.303
MATT: 14 just misses. It strikes across its
shoulder but glances off and slams into the wet,

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:04.518
sickening swamp floor with a (sucking) sound. It
has to pull itself out by wedging back and forth.

00:49:04.518 --> 00:49:09.972
LAURA: Aw man. I pop out from behind the tree and
say, "I was aiming for your butt." And then I'm

00:49:09.972 --> 00:49:13.608
going to cast Guiding Bolt at level three.

00:49:13.608 --> 00:49:16.483
MATT: Oh shit. All right. Roll your attack.

00:49:16.483 --> 00:49:23.009
LAURA: Damn it, fuck, mother bitch. No, it
doesn't hit.

00:49:23.009 --> 00:49:27.979
TALIESIN: There's a lot of threes in this game
right now.

00:49:27.979 --> 00:49:33.568
MATT: You watch as behind, (booming).

00:49:33.568 --> 00:49:35.540
SAM: Oh no! It's got a mate!

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:41.350
MATT: A tree blasts back from the Guiding Bolt,
slamming into already rotted roots, needed that

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.392
one final nudge, and the tree behind uproots
itself and falls.

00:49:44.392 --> 00:49:49.421
LAURA: Did you guys see how powerful that was?
Super powerful. I'm going to run away. I'm going

00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:54.908
to turn around and run the other direction. Yep,
right there.

00:49:54.908 --> 00:49:59.082
MATT: All right. That ends Jester's turn. Fjord,
you're up.

00:49:59.082 --> 00:50:02.531
TRAVIS: I'm going to move over here. Five, ten,
15.

00:50:02.531 --> 00:50:04.262
SAM: You're going closer?

00:50:04.262 --> 00:50:07.762
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm going to cast Witch Bolt at it.

00:50:07.762 --> 00:50:11.737
MATT: Go for it. Level one? What level you have
to.

00:50:11.787 --> 00:50:17.057
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever it is. 3d12. I have to roll
to hit first. 16?

00:50:17.057 --> 00:50:18.423
MATT: 16 does hit.

00:50:18.423 --> 00:50:33.513
TRAVIS: Hi, d12. I missed you. (counting) 18
points. Lightning damage.

00:50:33.513 --> 00:50:35.906
MATT: Plus a d6 because it has Hex on it.

00:50:35.906 --> 00:50:40.355
TRAVIS: Thank you for the reminder. Two. Solid 20
points.

00:50:40.355 --> 00:50:45.195
MATT: 20 points of damage. I'm putting this on
there for Witch Bolt, so if you wanted to use your

00:50:45.195 --> 00:50:50.449
action again, you can continue to hit it every
turn for a d12 automatically. Now you see, as

00:50:50.449 --> 00:50:54.801
Fjord steps around the corner and releases this
arcing bolt of purplish-black energy, this

00:50:54.801 --> 00:51:02.202
lightning arcs off and slams into the troll. The
energy continues to swirl around it. It tries to

00:51:02.202 --> 00:51:08.118
stop it and grasp for it to no effect. There's
this strange thread of faintly visible energy

00:51:08.118 --> 00:51:11.841
between it and Fjord right now. There's some sort
of connection between the two of them. All right,

00:51:11.841 --> 00:51:13.213
that ends your turn, Fjord?

00:51:13.213 --> 00:51:14.326
TRAVIS: It does.

00:51:14.326 --> 00:51:20.194
MATT: The troll's going to go first because it
rolled higher than Caleb. Immediately, it turns--

00:51:20.194 --> 00:51:21.644
LAURA: No!

00:51:21.644 --> 00:51:30.510
MATT: No. It's real angry at him because it just
got Hexed, Blasted, and then Bolted. It's going to

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.401
bypass the shiny swords right there.

00:51:32.401 --> 00:51:34.224
TALIESIN: Does it get close enough for me to take
a swing?

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:35.256
MATT: It does.

00:51:35.256 --> 00:51:40.464
TALIESIN: Swing, swing. I just get two attacks,
right?

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:43.003
MATT: You were holding your action, so you get two
attacks, yeah.

00:51:43.003 --> 00:51:49.879
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to use the good
sword. It doesn't matter. That's awful, and that's

00:51:49.879 --> 00:51:56.195
pretty good. That's 11, that misses, and 19, that
hits.

00:51:56.195 --> 00:51:57.676
MATT: That does hit.

00:51:57.676 --> 00:52:06.995
TALIESIN: That's 1d6 plus 1d4. 2d6 now, that's
right. That's not bad. That's ten points of

00:52:06.995 --> 00:52:08.439
damage.

00:52:08.439 --> 00:52:15.962
MATT: Ten points of damage, as you strike it with
one blade and miss with another. Immediately, as

00:52:15.962 --> 00:52:21.374
you strike across it with your blade, the venom
splashes into your face. You suffer 13 points of

00:52:21.374 --> 00:52:26.802
poison damage, and then it moves out of your
combat range. You can still take your reaction if

00:52:26.802 --> 00:52:27.991
you wanted to.

00:52:27.991 --> 00:52:29.246
TALIESIN: I will take my reaction. 13 points of
damage?

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:30.259
MATT: Yep.

00:52:30.259 --> 00:52:34.654
TALIESIN: That's fine. This is what I'm good for.
I'm taking it.

00:52:34.654 --> 00:52:36.012
ASHLEY: 100 gold!

00:52:36.012 --> 00:52:37.659
TALIESIN: 100 gold. Natural 20.

00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:39.701
(cheering)

00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:42.690
TALIESIN: New die.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:45.577
LAURA and TALIESIN: It's a pretty gold die.

00:52:45.577 --> 00:52:53.784
TALIESIN: Does the fact that I'm using what effect
I have--

00:52:53.784 --> 00:52:58.258
MATT: It does not appear to be undead. So it's 2d6
plus, and then double whatever you roll.

00:52:58.258 --> 00:52:59.941
TALIESIN: So it's 4d6 plus a little.

00:52:59.941 --> 00:53:01.897
MATT: Yeah, if you wanted to do it that way.

00:53:01.897 --> 00:53:10.666
TALIESIN: Ooh. That pretty much does the same
thing. (counting) 21 points of damage.

00:53:10.666 --> 00:53:20.937
MATT: As you carve past, with a third, final swing
towards it, you cut through a portion of muscle

00:53:20.937 --> 00:53:26.610
and tendon on its arm there, which immediately
slips, dull to one side, unmoving. The spray

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:30.228
splashes back in your face for only five points of
poison damage.

00:53:30.228 --> 00:53:39.107
And it's coming into you. As soon as that
arm goes limp, the muscle reconnects and the arm

00:53:39.107 --> 00:53:45.277
comes back with strength, angrily. It's going to
swing. It's going to take a bite and two claw

00:53:45.277 --> 00:53:46.823
attacks against you.

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:48.976
TALIESIN: He's also going to, of course, Curse of
the Eyeless.

00:53:48.976 --> 00:53:50.446
MATT: You can't. You already used your reaction to
attack him.

00:53:50.446 --> 00:53:51.621
TALIESIN: Oh, that was my reaction. Never mind.

00:53:51.621 --> 00:53:52.518
MATT: Sorry, buddy.

00:53:52.518 --> 00:53:53.640
TALIESIN: That's all right.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:54:02.500
MATT: For its bite attack against you, its jaws
open, Fjord. That is going to be a 26.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.849
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:54:03.849 --> 00:54:14.980
MATT: You take ten points of piercing damage, plus
six points of poison damage, and you are poisoned

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:21.342
until the start of its next turn, as the venom
courses through your veins. Its teeth and giant

00:54:21.342 --> 00:54:26.678
tusks dug into the front of your shoulder and
chest. The pain is strong, but it's holding you

00:54:26.678 --> 00:54:31.766
fast. From there, like a clawed wolverine, it
begins to rake at your chest with its claws on

00:54:31.766 --> 00:54:36.491
each side. The first one's going to be a 16 to
hit.

00:54:36.491 --> 00:54:37.956
TRAVIS: That misses.

00:54:37.956 --> 00:54:41.706
MATT: Right, because you have your shield out. The
shield blocks one of the claws. The other one

00:54:41.706 --> 00:54:46.611
attempts to reach behind it to get to your body.
That's going to be a 19.

00:54:46.611 --> 00:54:47.728
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:54:47.728 --> 00:54:49.148
MATT: With the other claw strike--

00:54:49.148 --> 00:54:51.039
LAURA: Is he grappled?

00:54:51.039 --> 00:54:55.819
MATT: No. He is not. That is nine plus four. 13
points of slashing damage.

00:54:55.819 --> 00:54:59.730
TRAVIS: (high-pitched yelp) I mean, (deeper
grunt).

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.661
MATT: And another three points of poison damage.

00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:02.991
TRAVIS: Jeez Louise.

00:55:02.991 --> 00:55:05.047
MATT: That's going to end its turn.

00:55:05.047 --> 00:55:07.514
LAURA and MARISHA: Run away!

00:55:07.514 --> 00:55:09.082
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

00:55:09.082 --> 00:55:13.595
LIAM: Oh, this thing is way closer than I was
prepared for. I take a little bit of molasses and

00:55:13.665 --> 00:55:18.797
rub it on my hands and say: slow down. You boys
have got this? Good. And I start to back away,

00:55:18.797 --> 00:55:26.752
casting Slow as I go. I will loop around by our
cleric. He has to beat a wisdom save against 16.

00:55:26.752 --> 00:55:32.810
MATT: Wisdom save? That is a 14 minus one. 13,
no.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.240
SAM: What does that do to it?

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.842
LAURA: It slows him, I think!

00:55:35.842 --> 00:55:38.639
MATT: Half movement, he can only make a single
attack on its turn.

00:55:38.639 --> 00:55:41.492
LIAM: He can do an attack or a bonus, but not
both.

00:55:41.492 --> 00:55:50.166
MATT: I need you to make two concentration checks,
by the way. Your Hex would be gone, technically.

00:55:50.166 --> 00:55:57.061
Which is my fault. Hex is gone, and make
constitution saving throws to see if you're

00:55:57.061 --> 00:55:58.878
maintaining your Witch Bolt.

00:55:58.878 --> 00:56:05.901
TRAVIS: That's an 11. That one saves. They both
save.

00:56:05.901 --> 00:56:07.521
MATT: All righty. Good on you.

00:56:07.521 --> 00:56:15.061
TRAVIS: I think it was four. You can add four hit
points, I think was the last Hex damage.

00:56:15.061 --> 00:56:19.307
LIAM: It was a cube, but Caleb, knowing that, would
put the troll in the corner and send the rest of

00:56:19.307 --> 00:56:20.705
it in that direction.

00:56:20.705 --> 00:56:22.392
MATT: I assumed as much. Okay.

00:56:22.392 --> 00:56:25.100
LIAM: Can't use reactions.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.406
MATT: Correct.

00:56:26.406 --> 00:56:28.230
LAURA: Oh, good.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:31.286
MATT: All right. Caleb, that finish your turn?

00:56:31.286 --> 00:56:32.517
LIAM: Ja.

00:56:32.517 --> 00:56:33.801
MATT: Nott, you're up.

00:56:33.801 --> 00:56:35.867
SAM: Is it in melee with good old Fjord?

00:56:35.867 --> 00:56:36.796
MATT: It is.

00:56:36.796 --> 00:56:41.162
SAM: Oh, thank god. I mean, not for you. I'll run
up within 30 feet.

00:56:41.162 --> 00:56:46.650
MATT: All righty, you move (counting) 30, there
you go.

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:50.958
SAM: And fire! Ooh, good, it's a lot!
20-something.

00:56:50.958 --> 00:56:54.305
MATT: That hits. Roll damage. It's hurt real bad
now.

00:56:54.305 --> 00:57:01.797
SAM: Okay, so that's 13 plus four is 17.

00:57:01.797 --> 00:57:09.045
MATT: 17 points of damage. And splash! Fjord, you
take nine points of poison damage right into your

00:57:09.045 --> 00:57:10.904
face as the bolt slashes through.

00:57:10.904 --> 00:57:13.006
TRAVIS: My eyes!

00:57:13.006 --> 00:57:14.968
SAM: I forgot about that.

00:57:14.968 --> 00:57:17.854
TRAVIS: Let it stop you not, my friend! Nott?
Nott.

00:57:17.854 --> 00:57:19.879
SAM: Wait, do let it stop me, or don't?

00:57:19.879 --> 00:57:21.461
TRAVIS: No, keep hitting it!

00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:26.636
MATT: It's holding on, barely. It's right there,
angrily making a last stand.

00:57:26.636 --> 00:57:32.057
SAM: I'll cock again and fire again! And it's
even more! 20-something to hit.

00:57:32.057 --> 00:57:33.676
MATT: Okay, roll damage.

00:57:33.676 --> 00:57:35.324
SAM: Only six points.

00:57:35.324 --> 00:57:42.517
MATT: Six points, still alive. Fjord, you take
another 13 points of poison damage.

00:57:42.517 --> 00:57:46.175
TRAVIS: I do?! Hit it again! (spraying)

00:57:46.175 --> 00:57:48.026
MARISHA: Oh no!

00:57:48.026 --> 00:57:49.812
SAM: I killed something!

00:57:49.812 --> 00:57:54.859
LAURA: Wait, nobody hit it because Fjord's going
to take serious damage!

00:57:54.859 --> 00:57:56.142
TRAVIS: Just hit it!

00:57:56.142 --> 00:57:58.924
MATT: It's standing, heavily breathing like
(panting).

00:57:58.924 --> 00:58:00.642
LAURA: You'll keep taking damage.

00:58:00.642 --> 00:58:03.058
TRAVIS: Oh no, I use my Relentless Endurance to
(singing).

00:58:03.058 --> 00:58:04.284
MATT: You do!

00:58:04.284 --> 00:58:07.807
ALL: (singing)

00:58:07.807 --> 00:58:13.235
MATT: You're about to go-- (straining). The orc
comes to. The blood of the half-orc kicks in, and

00:58:13.235 --> 00:58:15.481
you stand there angrily in its face.

00:58:15.481 --> 00:58:17.888
LIAM: Fjord Madeline Kahns back to life.

00:58:17.888 --> 00:58:20.778
(laughter)

00:58:20.778 --> 00:58:25.367
MATT: All righty, that finishes Nott's turn.
Molly, you're up.

00:58:25.367 --> 00:58:26.910
TALIESIN: Nobody else hit it!

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:28.482
MARISHA: Fjord, run!

00:58:28.482 --> 00:58:29.725
TRAVIS: Just hit it!

00:58:29.725 --> 00:58:34.571
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up, and I'm going to
flank it so I get advantage.

00:58:34.571 --> 00:58:38.407
MATT: You're up to your waist in swamp water,
looking up at it.

00:58:38.407 --> 00:58:48.254
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a hit. That's 20.

00:58:48.254 --> 00:58:50.132
MATT: 20, that hits.

00:58:50.132 --> 00:58:54.840
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.161
MATT: How do you want to do this?

00:58:57.161 --> 00:59:03.712
TALIESIN: I want to get the new sword, push, let
it bend, and pop into it.

00:59:03.712 --> 00:59:11.707
MATT: As you stab through its body, it tries to
spin and you watch this strange tensing of its

00:59:11.707 --> 00:59:16.310
abdominal muscles and its weird bulbous stomach
suddenly bursts out in front of you, Fjord.

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:18.162
TRAVIS: I'm down.

00:59:18.162 --> 00:59:19.914
MATT: Yeah, you take ten points of poison damage.

00:59:19.914 --> 00:59:22.694
TRAVIS: Ah! It was so cool!

00:59:22.694 --> 00:59:25.268
MATT: It looked almost like Molly killed them
both.

00:59:25.268 --> 00:59:30.403
TRAVIS: (sizzling)

00:59:30.403 --> 00:59:33.410
MARISHA: Two birds, Molly. I like it.

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.263
LAURA: Good one, Molly!

00:59:35.263 --> 00:59:39.352
MATT: Fjord is currently unconscious on the
ground, guys. What are you doing?

00:59:39.352 --> 00:59:41.043
LAURA: And he's poisoned, too, isn't he?

00:59:41.043 --> 00:59:43.106
MATT: As far as you know. You don't know.

00:59:43.106 --> 00:59:49.091
TALIESIN: I've got a bonus action. I'm going to
give him an auto-cure, just in case.

00:59:49.091 --> 00:59:53.659
MATT: Okay, so roll a constitution saving throw to
resist it.

00:59:53.659 --> 01:00:01.485
TALIESIN: The snake tattoo on my hand, the eye on
the back of my hand bursts, and blood comes

01:00:01.485 --> 01:00:04.596
pouring out of it. I take two points of damage.

01:00:04.596 --> 01:00:06.439
TRAVIS: That is 20.

01:00:06.439 --> 01:00:07.880
MATT: 20.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.510
MATT: Oh, did you amplify?

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:13.007
TALIESIN: I didn't need the amplify. Oh, actually
that's right, I don't have to take damage for

01:00:13.007 --> 01:00:14.091
that, never mind.

01:00:14.091 --> 01:00:21.947
MATT: So you watch as, where the snake is, the
blood bursts and the green venom that's currently

01:00:22.007 --> 01:00:27.005
coursing through the wounds in Fjord's unconscious
body suddenly (sucking noise) siphons out, hovers

01:00:27.005 --> 01:00:31.424
in the air for a moment, as Mollymauk is holding
his hand. And then the poison drops to the ground

01:00:31.424 --> 01:00:33.167
and disseminates into the swamp.

01:00:33.167 --> 01:00:34.131
LAURA: What?

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.245
ASHLEY: What? That is so cool!

01:00:35.245 --> 01:00:41.892
TALIESIN: I've never done that before. That--

01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:43.510
MATT: What are you guys doing?

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:45.305
LAURA: Wait, are you awake then, Fjord?

01:00:45.305 --> 01:00:46.969
MATT: Fjord is still unconscious. The poison's
gone but he's--

01:00:46.969 --> 01:00:48.581
SAM: Wait, what happened? Oh, he was just
unpoisoned.

01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:52.666
LAURA: I'll walk up to Fjord. And I'll cast Cure
Wounds at level one.

01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:56.146
SAM: Whenever you cure anyone, it feels like a
bother.

01:00:56.146 --> 01:00:57.956
MARISHA: I know, it's so begrudgingly.

01:00:57.956 --> 01:01:00.918
LAURA: I'll tap his head and be like: Wake up
already.

01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:07.189
TALIESIN: Just to be sure, I'm going to dig around
and make sure this is true death on this thing and

01:01:07.189 --> 01:01:10.106
it's not going to start regenerating or anything.
Does it look like it's regenerating at all?

01:01:10.106 --> 01:01:13.211
LAURA: Six points.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:14.294
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:01:14.294 --> 01:01:15.473
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:01:15.473 --> 01:01:16.604
SAM: I'll start looking for the gold.

01:01:16.604 --> 01:01:17.925
ASHLEY: We could just cut off its head.

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:20.314
MARISHA: I join Nott in looking for the gold.

01:01:20.314 --> 01:01:22.334
MATT: You guys begin to make your way over to
the--

01:01:22.384 --> 01:01:23.282
TALIESIN: 12.

01:01:23.282 --> 01:01:24.362
SAM: The skulls. I'm faster.

01:01:24.362 --> 01:01:26.134
(laughter)

01:01:26.134 --> 01:01:28.274
MARISHA: I'm pretty fucking fast. I'm pretty damn
fast.

01:01:28.274 --> 01:01:30.529
LAURA: Kiri, come out!

01:01:30.529 --> 01:01:35.177
MATT: Kiri begins to run around, joining over here
in the swamp area.

01:01:35.177 --> 01:01:37.337
TALIESIN: Don't poke it.

01:01:37.337 --> 01:01:39.382
LAURA: Don't stab the corpse this time, it's
poisonous.

01:01:39.382 --> 01:01:40.850
MATT: (like Jester) "It's poisonous."

01:01:42.006 --> 01:01:46.676
You're looking down at it and watching
as parts of the wounds are still tethering

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:47.919
together.

01:01:47.919 --> 01:01:49.202
TALIESIN: Okay, let's like, I'm going to gently--

01:01:49.202 --> 01:01:51.799
MATT: It hasn't come back to your turn yet,
unfortunately. Its turn's before that. You watch

01:01:51.799 --> 01:02:00.054
as it suddenly comes up from the ground, pulling
itself from the swamp, now conscious once more.

01:02:00.054 --> 01:02:01.499
SAM: (high-pitched scream)

01:02:01.499 --> 01:02:03.090
TRAVIS: Please don't.

01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:04.361
ASHLEY: Come. On!

01:02:04.361 --> 01:02:11.178
MATT: And it's going to take another heavy swing
towards Fjord. With advantage, because you're prone.

01:02:11.178 --> 01:02:12.417
MARISHA: The fuck?

01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:13.503
SAM: Did you already Cure Wounds?

01:02:13.503 --> 01:02:14.451
LAURA: I did.

01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:16.102
MATT: That's going to be 20 to hit.

01:02:16.102 --> 01:02:17.732
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester. (death rattle)

01:02:17.732 --> 01:02:23.974
MATT: That's going to be seven points of piercing
damage, and two points of poison.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:25.295
TRAVIS: He's out.

01:02:25.295 --> 01:02:26.793
MATT: Fjord falls unconscious once more.

01:02:26.793 --> 01:02:27.929
TRAVIS: (death rattle)

01:02:27.929 --> 01:02:29.271
LIAM: Just like Blink.

01:02:29.271 --> 01:02:30.899
TRAVIS: I'm back, I'm back.

01:02:30.899 --> 01:02:32.408
(laughter)

01:02:32.408 --> 01:02:33.493
SAM: Oh no!

01:02:33.493 --> 01:02:34.542
MARISHA: Time is weird for Fjord.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:37.411
TALIESIN: I feel like I should have had a-- Oh
well, that's fine.

01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:39.002
MATT: Well, it comes back around to the next
turn.

01:02:39.002 --> 01:02:40.461
TALIESIN: Ah. Six seconds can go quick.

01:02:40.461 --> 01:02:44.279
MATT: As soon as it comes back, it heals ten hit
points back up. So it came to consciousness. Just

01:02:44.279 --> 01:02:48.270
enough movement to get up from prone, knock Fjord
down. It's going to make another swipe at Fjord.

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.293
LIAM: Can it do that if it's Slowed?

01:02:50.293 --> 01:02:51.481
MATT: No, it can't!

01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:52.793
MARISHA: Is it still Slowed?

01:02:52.793 --> 01:02:53.849
LAURA: Oh, thank god.

01:02:53.849 --> 01:02:54.793
MATT: It's still Slowed, yeah.

01:02:54.793 --> 01:02:55.820
TRAVIS: Oh, my god.

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:56.829
MATT: Oh man.

01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:58.013
MARISHA: You just saved Fjord.

01:02:58.013 --> 01:02:59.400
TRAVIS: That was two death saving throws right
there.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.250
MARISHA: Yeah, it was.

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:01.297
MATT: And it had a third attack.

01:03:01.297 --> 01:03:02.198
MARISHA: It had another one?

01:03:02.198 --> 01:03:03.217
LIAM: But it doesn't anymore.

01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:04.215
MATT: But it doesn't anymore.

01:03:04.215 --> 01:03:05.225
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:03:05.225 --> 01:03:06.942
(laughter)

01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:09.268
TRAVIS: It's like walking on the edge of a cliff
in the middle of the night. And you didn't know

01:03:09.268 --> 01:03:13.699
how far the drop was, and you're just toeing the
edge. No idea what was on the other side.

01:03:13.699 --> 01:03:14.852
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:03:14.852 --> 01:03:17.324
MATT: All right. Fjord is unconscious. Brings us
back, Caleb, it is now your turn.

01:03:17.324 --> 01:03:19.394
LIAM: Oh, is it? Oh goodness, this is--

01:03:19.394 --> 01:03:21.897
MATT: As everyone's rushed around, it's got back
up, and just (slamming noise) Fjord's unconscious

01:03:21.897 --> 01:03:22.849
again.

01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:24.282
LAURA: Do you have Thunder Wave or anything that
can push it back?

01:03:24.282 --> 01:03:30.999
LIAM: DM, in everything that I've seen, when fire
has been used on this creature, did it splurt?

01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:32.665
MATT: It seemed to.

01:03:32.665 --> 01:03:34.343
LIAM: It seemed to splurt when I used fire.

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.427
MATT: Any sort of damage seemed to cause it to
splurt.

01:03:36.427 --> 01:03:37.409
LAURA: Still do it.

01:03:37.409 --> 01:03:39.181
SAM: Fire also did bad things to it and it didn't
regenerate. `

01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:40.266
TALIESIN: No! Fjord.

01:03:40.266 --> 01:03:42.192
LIAM: I know, but Fjord is right under it.

01:03:42.192 --> 01:03:43.398
TRAVIS: Just do it. Just do it.

01:03:43.398 --> 01:03:44.791
LAURA: Just save your attack--

01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:47.431
MARISHA: If it's at its turn, and now we're back
at the round so it's going to have another turn

01:03:47.431 --> 01:03:48.516
immediately?

01:03:48.516 --> 01:03:49.474
LAURA: No.

01:03:49.474 --> 01:03:52.103
MATT: No. That was its turn it just took. So now
we're going back to the initiative order again.

01:03:52.154 --> 01:03:54.808
LAURA: We all have our actions, so hold your
attack 'cause I'll pull Fjord away.

01:03:54.808 --> 01:03:58.124
TALIESIN: So now we have our full turn and it
can't react, so hold the-- I can move, I'll be

01:03:58.176 --> 01:04:01.691
fine. We all get a full turn before anything
happens.

01:04:01.691 --> 01:04:03.966
LIAM: So Caleb shouts out, should I burn this
thing now?

01:04:04.019 --> 01:04:05.322
TALIESIN: Wait one second!

01:04:05.322 --> 01:04:06.454
LAURA: Wait until I can pull him away!

01:04:06.454 --> 01:04:07.663
LIAM: All right, I'll hold on a moment.

01:04:07.663 --> 01:04:09.206
MATT: Real fast, hold on, I'm just checking Slow.

01:04:09.206 --> 01:04:11.892
LAURA: Ahh! No!

01:04:11.892 --> 01:04:14.826
SAM: This has suddenly become the most complicated
fight we've ever had!

01:04:14.826 --> 01:04:20.271
MATT: It gets to make a wisdom saving throw to see
if it can avoid Slow. No, it rolled a three.

01:04:20.271 --> 01:04:22.398
LIAM: (funny voice) Ah, sorry buddy.

01:04:22.398 --> 01:04:23.952
MATT: So, Caleb, what are you doing?

01:04:23.952 --> 01:04:27.674
LIAM: I just yell, should I burn it? And Jester
yelled, "Wait."

01:04:27.674 --> 01:04:28.550
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait!

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:29.353
MARISHA: Hold!

01:04:29.353 --> 01:04:30.931
LIAM: I'm going to hold the Glove of Blasting.

01:04:30.931 --> 01:04:31.921
MATT: Okay, what are you doing?

01:04:31.921 --> 01:04:35.229
LIAM: I'm going to burn it the moment Fjord
is in the clear.

01:04:35.229 --> 01:04:39.310
MATT: Okay, so you're holding until Fjord is clear
from his body. Got it. Okay, that brings us to

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:43.971
Nott. Nott, what are you doing? You turn around
and watch as the troll's now back up and slammed

01:04:43.971 --> 01:04:46.695
its claw into Fjord's now, once again, unconscious
body.

01:04:46.695 --> 01:04:48.046
TALIESIN: Hold until we're clear!

01:04:48.046 --> 01:05:00.671
SAM: Okay. Ahh! (scared, nervous noises) I want to
so bad! Am I within 30 feet?

01:05:00.671 --> 01:05:04.442
MATT: Currently? You can very easily get within 30
feet.

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.606
SAM: I'll get within 30 feet and then hold my
action to shoot.

01:05:07.606 --> 01:05:11.913
MATT: You step around the flaming pile of skulls
right there. And turn and get another bolt and--

01:05:11.913 --> 01:05:13.751
you're holding?

01:05:13.751 --> 01:05:18.402
SAM: I'm holding the attack until it looks like
it's safe to do so.

01:05:18.402 --> 01:05:20.786
MATT: Okay, holding the attack until Fjord's safe?

01:05:20.786 --> 01:05:21.767
SAM: Until Fjord's gone.

01:05:21.767 --> 01:05:23.008
MATT: You got it. All right, Molly, your turn.

01:05:23.008 --> 01:05:25.197
TALIESIN: I obviously can't hit it so--

01:05:25.197 --> 01:05:26.716
MATT: You can.

01:05:26.716 --> 01:05:27.758
TALIESIN: I mean--

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:29.428
SAM: You've got your...

01:05:29.428 --> 01:05:35.474
TALIESIN: I'm going to get his attention, peace
out. I'm going to Misty Step.

01:05:35.474 --> 01:05:36.715
SAM: Ooh.

01:05:36.715 --> 01:05:37.871
TRAVIS: Yeah, dude.

01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:39.800
MATT: Where do you want to go?

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.373
TALIESIN: I can go 30 feet.

01:05:41.373 --> 01:05:42.427
LAURA: 30 feet?

01:05:42.427 --> 01:05:43.527
TALIESIN: Yep, yep.

01:05:43.527 --> 01:05:45.375
LAURA: Go get the shinies before Nott.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:49.014
TALIESIN: I'm going to head to the shinies. I'm
going to Misty Step next to-- yeah, there we are.

01:05:49.014 --> 01:05:50.608
MATT: Right behind the fire.

01:05:50.608 --> 01:05:51.908
SAM: Maybe I'll just go back and hit it!

01:05:51.908 --> 01:05:52.974
LAURA: You won't.

01:05:53.023 --> 01:05:54.777
TALIESIN: I just need visual and just... no,
there's nothing I can do.

01:05:54.777 --> 01:05:57.054
MATT: All right, that finishes Molly's turn. Beau,
you're up.

01:05:57.054 --> 01:06:04.683
MARISHA: Are the two of you going to try and drag?
Or do you want to try and attack and Yasha and I

01:06:04.683 --> 01:06:05.722
can drag?

01:06:05.722 --> 01:06:06.687
LAURA: Whatever.

01:06:06.687 --> 01:06:07.898
MATT: Figure it out guys, it's your turn.

01:06:07.898 --> 01:06:12.006
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to run up, since I
know me and Yasha are together. I'm going to cast

01:06:12.006 --> 01:06:17.684
Step of the Wind, to give myself double movement,
or use a ki point.

01:06:17.684 --> 01:06:19.837
MATT: 25, 30. You don't even have to, to get to
it.

01:06:19.837 --> 01:06:21.162
MARISHA: I'm trying to get to Fjord.

01:06:21.162 --> 01:06:25.738
MATT: Oh, to get to Fjord, sorry. 40, 50, that's
60.

01:06:25.738 --> 01:06:27.867
MARISHA: Well, I would have gone a straight way,
but yeah.

01:06:27.867 --> 01:06:30.932
LAURA: Now you have used all your movement and you
can't pull him away.

01:06:30.932 --> 01:06:32.994
MARISHA: Step of the Wind, I have double
movement.

01:06:32.994 --> 01:06:34.286
MATT: (counting) 40. So you have, that's your--

01:06:34.286 --> 01:06:39.689
MARISHA: Okay. And I'm going to grab onto him and
I'm going to turn to Yasha and I'm going to say,

01:06:39.689 --> 01:06:42.357
Help me, and I'm going to pull when she gets up to
it.

01:06:42.357 --> 01:06:46.140
MATT: Okay, so you spend an action just to hold
onto him. You currently have him grappled.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:49.811
MARISHA: I'm going to pull when she gets up. I'm
going to help her pull him out.

01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:52.174
MATT: Okay, got it. Yasha?

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:57.470
ASHLEY: So I'm going to move forward, grab the
other side, that she doesn't have, and pull him.

01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:04.492
MATT: All right. So you move over, action, and
you're going to pull him away. All righty, you are

01:07:04.492 --> 01:07:07.927
not in melee range so you manage to pull him back
here. Fjord, you get--

01:07:07.927 --> 01:07:09.212
TALIESIN: He has no reaction.

01:07:09.212 --> 01:07:12.033
MATT: I know he doesn't. So you pull him back.
Fjord is now right there.

01:07:12.033 --> 01:07:13.448
ASHLEY: How far back can I pull him?

01:07:13.448 --> 01:07:17.403
MARISHA: I want to assist her, though. Can we get
him further if I assist? That was the whole point

01:07:17.403 --> 01:07:18.821
of me doing that.

01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:23.017
MATT: Hmm. It gets a little wonky with action, but
I'll let you do it.

01:07:23.017 --> 01:07:24.838
MARISHA: Okay.

01:07:24.838 --> 01:07:27.790
MATT: With the speed you have left, you guys can
pull him about there.

01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:30.108
MARISHA: If not, if she can handle him, then.

01:07:30.108 --> 01:07:33.465
MATT: Well, it's half speed through the swamp, and
then it's half speed dragging somebody. So it's a

01:07:33.465 --> 01:07:39.255
slow shift because you're moving through the muck
and dragging him out of this thick swamp. So

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:40.396
that's as far as you can get.

01:07:40.396 --> 01:07:41.176
MARISHA: Okay.

01:07:41.176 --> 01:07:42.972
MATT: It does not get any reaction though, because
it's currently still affected by the Slow spell

01:07:42.972 --> 01:07:49.820
and it looks like right now Fjord is in a position
where he is outside of the splash radius. Which

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.972
would trigger Caleb and Nott.

01:07:51.972 --> 01:07:54.328
LIAM: Scorching Ray.

01:07:54.328 --> 01:07:55.603
SAM: Oh. Firing.

01:07:55.603 --> 01:07:58.098
MATT: You fire, and you are using the Scorching
Ray from the glove.

01:07:58.098 --> 01:08:03.536
LIAM: Yeah. First is a 20, second is an 18, and
the third is a 20.

01:08:03.536 --> 01:08:04.756
MATT: All hit.

01:08:04.756 --> 01:08:05.793
LIAM: They all hit.

01:08:05.793 --> 01:08:08.656
SAM: 22 to hit for me. But it's not a sneak
attack?

01:08:08.656 --> 01:08:11.118
MATT: Roll damage. No. There's nobody in range of
it right now.

01:08:11.118 --> 01:08:12.274
LAURA: Oh.

01:08:12.274 --> 01:08:13.851
SAM: (disgustedly) Five points.

01:08:13.851 --> 01:08:16.085
MATT: Five points of damage. It's still conscious.

01:08:16.085 --> 01:08:18.437
MARISHA: Kill him, kill him.

01:08:18.437 --> 01:08:21.887
LAURA: Five points, if you get more than five
points he's dead.

01:08:21.887 --> 01:08:25.978
LIAM: I did. A total of 27.

01:08:25.978 --> 01:08:26.975
LAURA: Yeah!

01:08:26.975 --> 01:08:28.683
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:08:28.683 --> 01:08:35.163
LIAM: There is-- I am with these people! And I am
going to burn his head off.

01:08:35.163 --> 01:08:36.758
SAM: (laughs)

01:08:36.758 --> 01:08:38.426
ASHLEY: Here we go.

01:08:38.426 --> 01:08:42.897
MATT: As you turn, the glove sparking as you
release these three blasts, one strikes his chest

01:08:42.897 --> 01:08:47.436
and ignites, his arm begins to burn black. This
one hits the other shoulder and you watch as the

01:08:47.436 --> 01:08:52.149
torso begins to ignite. The third one finally hits
right in the jaw and you see the shadowed line of

01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:57.781
its face, eyes and mouth open before (fire
crackling). Incinerated to ash. I need you to go

01:08:57.781 --> 01:09:00.363
ahead and make a wisdom saving throw please.

01:09:00.363 --> 01:09:05.841
MARISHA: Oh shit, Caleb.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.696
LIAM: (high-pitched) Oh shit. Oh shit.

01:09:08.696 --> 01:09:09.854
Fünf.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:14.688
MATT: Caleb's arms kind of just fall slack, and he
slumps to his knees, staring at the now-flaming

01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:19.875
corpse of the troll as it slumps into the ground
and begins to burn, half-submerged in swamp water,

01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:23.588
half of it now just this burning mass of ash and
flesh.

01:09:23.588 --> 01:09:25.414
LAURA: Whoa.

01:09:25.414 --> 01:09:26.486
MATT: So.

01:09:26.486 --> 01:09:31.381
LAURA: That was really graphic!

01:09:31.381 --> 01:09:33.728
SAM: Oh, he's still down.

01:09:33.728 --> 01:09:35.774
LAURA: Oh, are you dead or something?

01:09:35.774 --> 01:09:37.630
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we've got to wake him up now!
Cause he's almost dead.

01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:39.415
LAURA: Ugh. I go over and I use another--

01:09:39.415 --> 01:09:40.671
MATT: Go ahead and make a death saving throw.

01:09:40.671 --> 01:09:41.886
LAURA: --healing spell.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:43.399
TRAVIS: 19.

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:46.065
MATT: Yeah, you're fine, all right. It's fine. I
just like making him roll.

01:09:46.065 --> 01:09:50.632
LAURA: Yay! I do Cure Wounds on him again. Stop
doing this!

01:09:50.632 --> 01:09:53.827
TRAVIS: Ugh. I feel like this is a rough day.

01:09:53.827 --> 01:09:56.307
LAURA: Ooh. 11 points this time.

01:09:56.307 --> 01:10:02.525
TRAVIS: 11 points? I sit back up against the tree
and sit there in the water, britches in the water,

01:10:02.525 --> 01:10:04.058
just not caring.

01:10:04.058 --> 01:10:13.237
MARISHA: Beau gets up, seeing Caleb a little bit
messed up, and I'm going to go up to him and I'm

01:10:13.237 --> 01:10:15.877
going to grab him and be like: let's take a walk.

01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:27.101
MATT: You pull him away. He's not present,
currently.

01:10:27.101 --> 01:10:29.860
MARISHA: That's fine. I'm walking with him a
little bit, slowly.

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:39.195
LAURA: I'm going to take my axe and I'm going to
try to cut out his heart. Just in case. Very

01:10:39.195 --> 01:10:40.947
slowly, so it doesn't splatter.

01:10:40.947 --> 01:10:45.906
MATT: You have to wait a moment, because currently
the body is being engulfed. Eventually the flames

01:10:45.906 --> 01:10:51.154
die down to the point where you can carve into its
body, but most of its flesh is burned. It's

01:10:51.154 --> 01:10:54.343
definitely dead. Make a medicine check.

01:10:54.343 --> 01:11:05.110
LAURA: Okay. 12.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:12.394
MATT: You manage to eventually hack away, get to
where the troll heart would be, and carve it out

01:11:12.394 --> 01:11:20.120
without damaging it beyond any interest in this
piece. It's a deep forest green, looks like it has

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:27.525
half-formed additional ventricles that never fully
completed. It's pretty disgusting, and you go to

01:11:27.525 --> 01:11:29.922
touch it, and your fingers--

01:11:29.922 --> 01:11:35.270
LAURA: I don't want to touch it. I'm going to use
my fabric and try to get it out, like a cloth or

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:36.257
something.

01:11:36.257 --> 01:11:39.368
MATT: Okay. You pull it out. It is corroding the
cloth slowly.

01:11:39.368 --> 01:11:41.857
LAURA: Ah! Does anybody have anything glass or
metal?

01:11:41.857 --> 01:11:44.194
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:11:44.194 --> 01:11:46.292
LAURA: Put it in there!

01:11:46.292 --> 01:11:47.394
TALIESIN: No, I'm not going to do that.

01:11:47.394 --> 01:11:49.089
LAURA: Why? It squirted poison!

01:11:49.089 --> 01:11:52.699
MATT: It's that big. It's about basketball size.

01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:54.111
LAURA: We can keep it!

01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:56.230
TALIESIN: What are you going to do with that? You
don't want that.

01:11:56.230 --> 01:12:01.973
LAURA: I'm going to sit on the ground. I'm going
to look through my stuff, see if I have anything

01:12:01.973 --> 01:12:03.078
that can hold it.

01:12:03.078 --> 01:12:05.539
TALIESIN: I'm going to go through the skulls. Do
you want to join me going through the skulls right now?

01:12:05.539 --> 01:12:12.621
SAM: I was going to go to Caleb's aid, but seeing
Beau walk away with him, I nod and go back to

01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:15.225
looking through the skulls for gold.

01:12:15.225 --> 01:12:16.827
TALIESIN: Let's not crowd the boy.

01:12:16.827 --> 01:12:19.514
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys make investigation
checks as you're looking through the rest of that.

01:12:19.514 --> 01:12:20.652
Yasha, what are you doing?

01:12:20.652 --> 01:12:26.057
ASHLEY: I'm going to start walking over towards
where the skulls are.

01:12:26.057 --> 01:12:29.856
SAM: 20 for me.

01:12:29.856 --> 01:12:30.930
TALIESIN: Ten.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:39.188
MATT: Unfortunately, the concussive blast of the
dynamite shattered most of the bones and any

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:45.845
materials that were in here, so what would've at one
time been fairly easy to scavenge what remains,

01:12:45.845 --> 01:12:51.719
you gather from the patches of now dried and
destroyed swamp ground that much of it has been

01:12:51.719 --> 01:12:58.551
scattered all across. You do manage to find some
coins between the two of you-- mostly you, Nott--

01:12:58.551 --> 01:13:03.232
and it takes some digging. You're basically having
to pan for gold here. You're going in the muck and

01:13:03.232 --> 01:13:07.538
having to sift through your fingers and pour your
water out a bit, take it into the water. You

01:13:07.538 --> 01:13:16.185
manage to find roughly 26 gold pieces, ten silver
pieces, and let's say about 50 copper pieces.

01:13:16.185 --> 01:13:19.211
MARISHA: Quarter of what we came back for, but
sure!

01:13:19.211 --> 01:13:23.319
LAURA: Does his body have a pouch on him at all?
Can I search the body?

01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:26.651
MATT: The body of the troll? Make another
investigation check.

01:13:26.651 --> 01:13:29.090
MARISHA: Where's Febron's nasty body?

01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:33.450
SAM: Yeah, any other items that weren't
destroyed?

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:34.857
LAURA: 13.

01:13:34.857 --> 01:13:44.030
MATT: There's basic hides wrapped around the
midsection. There is a small pouch. You go inside

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:50.410
and pull through and immediately your hands hit
something that feels very cold and somewhat slimy.

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:57.073
Looking inside, looks like there are slivers of
muscle. Fresh muscle that had been torn off of

01:13:57.073 --> 01:14:03.391
some sort of a body laid in there. The smell is a
little bit putrid. It may have been in there

01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:05.852
pickling for a while.

01:14:05.852 --> 01:14:08.283
LAURA: Hey, Nott, I found some pickled muscle for
you.

01:14:08.283 --> 01:14:11.774
SAM: What kind of species?

01:14:11.774 --> 01:14:13.637
LAURA: The slimy kind.

01:14:13.637 --> 01:14:16.620
MATT: You can make a medicine check to try and
identify it.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:21.010
LAURA: Man, my medicine checks are sucking. Ten.

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:23.425
MATT: Ten. Probably human.

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:24.952
LAURA: It's probably human.

01:14:24.952 --> 01:14:26.355
SAM: I'll take that.

01:14:26.355 --> 01:14:27.580
MATT: Caleb, you shake out of it.

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:34.987
LAURA: I'm going to take the hide he had covering
his junk, and wrap it around the heart, because

01:14:34.987 --> 01:14:37.339
obviously it can take being splattered by venom.

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:44.731
MATT: Yeah, okay. That it does. In revealing the
partially singed troll dong, you also manage to

01:14:44.731 --> 01:14:48.018
properly wrap the heart for its own use.

01:14:48.018 --> 01:14:50.333
TRAVIS: Us and troll dongs, man!

01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:55.028
MATT: Each campaign. It's a through line, guys!

01:14:55.028 --> 01:14:58.170
SAM: Can we keep the dong?

01:14:58.170 --> 01:14:59.698
LAURA: I don't want the dong.

01:14:59.698 --> 01:15:01.632
TALIESIN: There's no sense repeating.

01:15:01.632 --> 01:15:06.031
MATT: So, Fjord, what are you doing?

01:15:06.031 --> 01:15:12.830
TRAVIS: I'm sitting there, watching Caleb and
Yasha walk off and feeling sorry for myself.

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:18.469
MATT: Okay. Caleb, you manage to snap out of it,
and come back to reality.

01:15:18.469 --> 01:15:28.211
MARISHA: I hand him one skin and I say: Here, this
one's water. This one's booze. Take the water and

01:15:28.211 --> 01:15:37.018
I pour it out on one of my sashes and dab off his
forehead a little bit. You all right?

01:15:37.018 --> 01:15:41.651
LIAM: Ja.

01:15:41.651 --> 01:15:44.528
MARISHA: Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

01:15:44.528 --> 01:15:49.206
TRAVIS: Y'all mind if we take a short rest or
something?

01:15:49.206 --> 01:15:55.097
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that. There's a campfire
over there that Yasha and I made with the oil and

01:15:55.097 --> 01:15:59.415
the torch that we threw. It's already done. Let's
go sit by that.

01:15:59.415 --> 01:16:01.103
LAURA: Sit by the skulls!

01:16:01.103 --> 01:16:07.890
MATT: It's a pile of bone and skull shards that is
still burning and will be burning for a while from

01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:08.843
the oils.

01:16:08.843 --> 01:16:10.041
LAURA: It's cozy over here.

01:16:10.041 --> 01:16:12.171
MARISHA: Can I get my oil flask back too?

01:16:12.171 --> 01:16:20.533
MATT: No. That flask shattered on impact, sorry.
You guys take a short rest.

01:16:20.533 --> 01:16:22.700
SAM: I'll give out all the gold.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.704
LAURA: Whoa, you pass out the 26 gold?

01:16:25.704 --> 01:16:31.636
SAM: Yeah, so we all get three. We all get three
gold pieces. I'm keeping the extras.

01:16:31.636 --> 01:16:37.395
MATT: The downside of throwing dynamite into the
reward pile.

01:16:37.395 --> 01:16:48.386
TRAVIS: I heal 39 points. I only have one hit dice
left.

01:16:48.386 --> 01:16:56.761
MATT: You guys finish your short rest. You're
feeling a little more collected. What do you wish

01:16:56.761 --> 01:16:58.280
to do?

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.525
LAURA: I guess we should go home, huh? I mean,
back to the town.

01:17:01.525 --> 01:17:05.857
TALIESIN: Especially since we're now a 100
gold richer.

01:17:05.857 --> 01:17:10.424
MATT: You look around and see Kiri sitting there
with the knife and is stabbing the troll body.

01:17:10.424 --> 01:17:14.533
LAURA: Don't stab the troll, it's poisonous! It
will hurt you.

01:17:14.533 --> 01:17:17.114
MATT: It's not splashing venom, it looks like.

01:17:17.114 --> 01:17:20.484
TALIESIN: I guess get it out of your system then,
that's fine.

01:17:20.484 --> 01:17:23.127
TRAVIS: 26 and ten silver.

01:17:23.127 --> 01:17:25.392
TALIESIN: Are you done yet?

01:17:25.392 --> 01:17:27.600
MATT: (like Caleb) "This means we are friends."

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.402
LAURA: I think we're a bad influence on her.

01:17:31.402 --> 01:17:34.246
SAM: I don't think so. Kiri, would you like some
human jerky?

01:17:34.246 --> 01:17:37.100
LAURA and TRAVIS: No, don't! No!

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:40.902
SAM: What? I thought birds might like that.

01:17:40.902 --> 01:17:46.018
LAURA: No. Don't eat human, Kiri. Don't stab
humans and don't eat humans, okay?

01:17:46.018 --> 01:17:47.992
MATT: (like Jester) "Don't stab humans. Don't eat
humans. Okay?"

01:17:47.992 --> 01:17:52.190
TALIESIN: Unless you're really out of anything to
eat. Then I suppose, you know, desperate times.

01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:53.814
LAURA: Do what you have to.

01:17:53.814 --> 01:17:57.713
TRAVIS: Well, I'm glad we did that. Shall we
continue on our way?

01:17:57.713 --> 01:17:59.869
LAURA: Are you okay, Fjord? You died twice.

01:17:59.869 --> 01:18:03.351
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just meant to--

01:18:03.351 --> 01:18:06.640
SAM: Well, three times, because the first time he
snapped back up himself.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.364
LAURA: Oh that's true, three whole times!

01:18:08.364 --> 01:18:13.158
TRAVIS: Yeah, that didn't go the way I planned. My
strategy went to shit.

01:18:13.158 --> 01:18:16.394
SAM: Do you still have the crazy eye thing in your
stomach?

01:18:16.394 --> 01:18:18.095
TRAVIS: In my stomach?

01:18:18.095 --> 01:18:21.489
LAURA: I poke his stomach. Does it feel like
there's a hard thing in there?

01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:23.694
MATT: No, it seems classic Fjord stomach.

01:18:23.694 --> 01:18:25.216
TRAVIS: Just these abs, babe.

01:18:25.216 --> 01:18:27.688
(laughter)

01:18:27.688 --> 01:18:29.176
LAURA: Can't feel anything past the steel.

01:18:29.176 --> 01:18:30.923
TRAVIS: You feel all six of them. Eight of them.

01:18:30.923 --> 01:18:33.246
MATT: Nine?

01:18:33.246 --> 01:18:39.588
TRAVIS: Nine. That is a-- what do you call it when
you have-- oh shit, hernia.

01:18:39.588 --> 01:18:42.227
(laughter)

01:18:42.227 --> 01:18:47.530
SAM: All right, I guess we'll keep going.

01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:49.130
LAURA: Yeah, we should probably do that.

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:52.633
SAM: Oh wait, did they ever come back from their
little walk?

01:18:52.633 --> 01:18:54.319
MARISHA: Yeah, I imagine we wandered back.

01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:55.474
TRAVIS: Yeah, you shook it off.

01:18:55.474 --> 01:18:56.740
LIAM: Shook it off.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.988
MARISHA: He's great.

01:18:57.988 --> 01:18:59.237
SAM: How are you, Caleb?

01:18:59.237 --> 01:19:00.657
LIAM: Good. Good.

01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:06.160
SAM: You faded away there for a second. Are you
okay?

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.122
ASHLEY: Yeah, what happened? You good? Okay.

01:19:09.122 --> 01:19:12.807
LAURA: He gets weird when he kills people when he
burns them. He did it before.

01:19:12.807 --> 01:19:16.403
SAM: I think anyone would, really.

01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:20.755
LAURA: I don't know if Kiri would. She'd probably
be cool with it.

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:25.431
LIAM: But Fjord is still here, so there is the
important thing. Let's focus on the good things in

01:19:25.431 --> 01:19:26.859
our lives.

01:19:26.859 --> 01:19:29.318
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you, Caleb. Appreciate that.

01:19:29.318 --> 01:19:30.629
ASHLEY: You took care of the problem.

01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:33.648
MARISHA: Yeah. I feel like those two aren't
mutually exclusive or anything, but yeah.

01:19:33.648 --> 01:19:37.330
LAURA: Let's start walking!

01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:38.428
MARISHA: All right.

01:19:38.428 --> 01:19:39.605
TALIESIN: It's just getting awkward.

01:19:39.605 --> 01:19:43.860
MATT: All right. You guys continue making your way
back towards Berleben. You made most of the

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:50.739
journey and by the time the sky begins to subtly
grow dark with the threat of dusk imminent in the

01:19:50.739 --> 01:19:55.529
next hour or so, you guys begin to make visual on
the lantern lights in the outskirts of the

01:19:55.529 --> 01:20:01.482
northern side of the city. Within a short time.
before it gets too dark in the swamp, you manage

01:20:01.482 --> 01:20:04.071
to make your way inside Berleben proper.

01:20:04.071 --> 01:20:06.283
LAURA: We did it!

01:20:06.283 --> 01:20:07.841
MATT: You're still in the Puddles.

01:20:07.841 --> 01:20:12.660
MARISHA: Is there another inn, other than that
bougie, terrible, underground situation?

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:16.210
TALIESIN: Did you just say bougie? Ugh. God, never
mind, I don't like you again.

01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:18.710
MARISHA: That was pretty bougie.

01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:22.363
LAURA: Yeah, we were in the bad part of town. We
can go to the nice part of town.

01:20:22.363 --> 01:20:24.316
LIAM: What is this word, "bougie?"

01:20:24.316 --> 01:20:30.658
MARISHA: When you want to try and seem fancy, but
it's a little ostentatious.

01:20:30.658 --> 01:20:32.812
LIAM: Is that in Common? Is that a Common word?

01:20:32.812 --> 01:20:39.070
TALIESIN: It's a word that people use when they
want to sound ostentatious about how ostentatious

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:40.547
something is.

01:20:40.547 --> 01:20:43.572
MARISHA: Yeah, it's short for bourgeois, which is
super ostentatious.

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:46.269
LIAM: The Zemnian word for that is like seven
syllables long.

01:20:46.269 --> 01:20:48.492
MARISHA: That's ostentatious.

01:20:48.492 --> 01:20:50.015
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.

01:20:50.015 --> 01:20:55.249
SAM: Oh, you're going to send a message. What's
the message? Completed first half of mission?

01:20:55.249 --> 01:20:56.615
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:56.615 --> 01:20:58.347
SAM: Send money.

01:20:58.347 --> 01:21:02.315
TALIESIN: It's collect when we get back.

01:21:02.315 --> 01:21:05.753
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending and send a
message to The Gentleman.

01:21:05.753 --> 01:21:07.359
MARISHA: Safe house cleared?

01:21:07.359 --> 01:21:10.680
MATT: Okay. He cannot respond though, right?

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.860
SAM: You can reply to this message.

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:15.208
MATT: Oh, can answer in a like manner
immediately.

01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:21.371
LAURA: I'm going to say: Hey, Mr. Gentleman. We
found your safe house. We cleared it out of a

01:21:21.371 --> 01:21:28.850
bunch of fish people. Don't worry, everything's
fine now, okay. We also found a troll in the

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:35.411
swamp, we killed that too, and we also found some
crocodiles. Please respond to this. If you need

01:21:35.411 --> 01:21:37.739
anything let us know, okay?

01:21:37.739 --> 01:21:39.528
TALIESIN: And his agent is dead. His person out
here is dead.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:42.803
LAURA: And your agent out here, the guy with the
no teeth, is dead.

01:21:42.803 --> 01:21:47.238
MATT: Seeing as how the spell's limit is 25
words--

01:21:47.238 --> 01:21:52.687
(laughter)

01:21:52.687 --> 01:22:01.809
MATT: There's a moment where you hear in your mind
a familiar voice of The Gentleman going, "I think

01:22:01.809 --> 01:22:13.477
"I catch your gist. Well done. Keep trucking?" You
hear the confused rise at the end.

01:22:13.477 --> 01:22:18.012
LAURA: He interrupted me while I was telling him
what we did.

01:22:18.012 --> 01:22:19.271
SAM: Yeah, there was still more to say.

01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:22.719
LAURA: Yeah, there was so much more, but I think
he got the idea. We'll get the bonus.

01:22:22.719 --> 01:22:27.306
MARISHA: Jester's that person who keeps trying to
record the voicemail and gets cut off. Aw,

01:22:27.306 --> 01:22:28.870
re-record, one more time!

01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:32.976
TALIESIN: Or trying to send an email. "How does
this work?" All caps.

01:22:32.976 --> 01:22:38.221
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation
near one of the lanterns, you see a cloaked figure

01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:44.788
that's sitting on a bench suddenly stand up and
face you, and begin to walk towards you.

01:22:44.788 --> 01:22:48.274
MARISHA: Wait, we're in the tavern?

01:22:48.274 --> 01:22:50.226
MATT: You're walking through the Puddles.

01:22:50.226 --> 01:22:52.538
SAM: Scatter, scatter!

01:22:52.538 --> 01:22:53.545
TRAVIS: No.

01:22:53.545 --> 01:22:55.858
SAM: Take to the sewers!

01:22:55.858 --> 01:23:03.238
MATT: The figure approaches. Somebody in the tech
sneezed, I think.

01:23:03.238 --> 01:23:06.494
MARISHA: Can I pull and grab my staff a little
bit?

01:23:06.494 --> 01:23:08.761
TALIESIN: Just ruin everything, there we are.

01:23:08.761 --> 01:23:09.846
MATT: I know.

01:23:09.846 --> 01:23:13.079
TRAVIS: All I could see is somebody go (fart
sound).

01:23:13.079 --> 01:23:22.354
MATT: The figure approaches and pulls the hood
back, and you see a scruffy chin, the unkempt

01:23:22.354 --> 01:23:27.973
hair, a dirtier, but excited, Horris Thrym.

01:23:27.973 --> 01:23:31.003
MARISHA: Oh my god, Horris! Oh, he's not dead!

01:23:31.003 --> 01:23:37.502
MATT: He goes, "Well, word of a motley group of
strangers spreads in whispers, and I knew it had

01:23:37.502 --> 01:23:46.482
"to be you based on the description. My friends,
you've come this way. This place is miserable. Oh,

01:23:46.482 --> 01:23:49.868
"do not think that I don't appreciate what you've
done for me, please."

01:23:49.868 --> 01:23:52.079
TRAVIS: No, you're right on the nose. It's pretty
miserable.

01:23:52.079 --> 01:23:53.322
MARISHA: Yeah, this place sucks.

01:23:53.322 --> 01:24:00.061
MATT: "As rough as this journey was, I'd rather be
here than in prison. What word of Zadash has come?

01:24:00.061 --> 01:24:01.674
"Is Dolan all right?"

01:24:01.674 --> 01:24:06.979
MARISHA: He's fine. He was sitting pretty next to
the other diplomats of the town.

01:24:06.979 --> 01:24:09.478
LAURA: Yeah, he seemed like he was doing pretty
good when we saw him.

01:24:09.478 --> 01:24:12.114
TALIESIN: Except, of course, that they're making
ready for war.

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:15.382
MATT: "I've heard whispers of that as well."

01:24:15.382 --> 01:24:21.544
MARISHA: Did you see that crazy army ride by?
There was a lot of horses. A lot.

01:24:21.544 --> 01:24:29.868
MATT: "I've been here for over a week, so no. But
I'm sure there was. How long should I stay? What

01:24:29.868 --> 01:24:32.443
"is the current atmosphere there?"

01:24:32.443 --> 01:24:35.149
LIAM: That is a big question mark at the moment.

01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:36.536
SAM: It's chaotic.

01:24:36.536 --> 01:24:39.324
MATT: "Is it safe to return or should I hang low a
little longer?"

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:43.209
LAURA: You know what, it might be, because I think
they decided to charge other people with the

01:24:43.209 --> 01:24:44.434
crimes and stuff.

01:24:44.434 --> 01:24:47.300
TRAVIS: The gates were pretty heavily watched,
though.

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.740
LAURA: Were they still, though? Are they?

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.048
TRAVIS: At war?

01:24:51.048 --> 01:24:52.424
LAURA: I don't remember.

01:24:52.424 --> 01:24:58.090
LIAM: Perhaps wait until you receive word from
him.

01:24:58.090 --> 01:25:03.285
MATT: "Okay, I'll remain in this quaint city."

01:25:03.285 --> 01:25:08.891
LIAM: Well, he has a better eye on the situation
than we do. He's right in the thick of it now.

01:25:08.891 --> 01:25:13.668
MATT: "That's true, I'll be patient. Thank you all
so much. I really appreciate it."

01:25:13.668 --> 01:25:18.799
LAURA: Horris, do you have a lot of diamonds on
you? Maybe some that are worth 300 gold?

01:25:18.799 --> 01:25:21.594
TALIESIN: So thirsty.

01:25:21.594 --> 01:25:26.452
MATT: "No, I don't. But if I do, I'll let you
know. "

01:25:26.452 --> 01:25:28.348
LAURA: I'm on the lookout, okay.

01:25:28.348 --> 01:25:32.476
MATT: "I genuinely wish to make this up to you at
some point. If it is diamonds you require I'll

01:25:32.476 --> 01:25:33.653
"begin looking."

01:25:33.653 --> 01:25:36.720
SAM: Do you know anywhere in town where they might
have that many diamonds?

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:48.926
MATT: He stops and looks around the city and goes,
"I don't know if this is the place. Call me crazy, but--"

01:25:48.926 --> 01:25:52.432
LIAM: Is there anything of use or value here? At
all?

01:25:52.432 --> 01:25:58.684
MATT: "Fish, swamp fungus, herbs."

01:25:58.684 --> 01:26:01.470
LAURA: Poisonous troll hearts!

01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:03.546
SAM: You have it? Ah!

01:26:03.546 --> 01:26:06.381
MATT: He steps back.

01:26:06.381 --> 01:26:09.621
TALIESIN: Where would we sell such a thing like
this?

01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:18.749
MATT: He starts thinking for a second, then goes
"Maybe there," and points to what is another two

01:26:18.749 --> 01:26:22.796
story building that had been burned and left to
rot that now appears to be a hollow structure

01:26:22.796 --> 01:26:26.254
that is overgrown with greenery and plants.

01:26:26.254 --> 01:26:28.341
TALIESIN: Is that an apothecary? Do you have an
apothecary here?

01:26:28.341 --> 01:26:31.198
MATT: "It seems to be from what I've noticed in
passing."

01:26:31.198 --> 01:26:37.853
TALIESIN: My god I miss shopping! I'm going to
give him three gold for his trouble. You're

01:26:37.853 --> 01:26:39.965
brilliant! And I'm heading in that direction.

01:26:39.965 --> 01:26:46.965
MATT: "Thank you. Thank you all. If you see Dolan,
tell him please, come get me."

01:26:46.965 --> 01:26:50.248
TRAVIS: No fear, we won't be too much longer.
We're going to head back to Zadash after we take

01:26:50.248 --> 01:26:54.345
care of some other business. And we'll be sure to
check in. Word will find its way to you soon.

01:26:54.345 --> 01:26:55.449
MATT: "Thank you."

01:26:55.449 --> 01:26:57.148
MARISHA: Where are you staying right now?

01:26:57.148 --> 01:26:59.114
MATT: "I'm over at The Drowned Nest."

01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:00.981
MARISHA and TRAVIS: The Drowned Nest.

01:27:00.981 --> 01:27:04.513
MARISHA: How are rooms there? Are they underground
and filled with water and mold?

01:27:04.513 --> 01:27:09.434
MATT: "No, they're better than that place." And he
points to The Keystone Pub where you guys stayed

01:27:09.434 --> 01:27:10.388
the night.

01:27:10.388 --> 01:27:12.041
TRAVIS: Who would stay there right? I mean--

01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:13.504
MATT: "Not to my standards."

01:27:13.504 --> 01:27:15.133
TALIESIN: It's quaint and rustic, shut up.

01:27:15.133 --> 01:27:20.472
MARISHA: The Drowned Nest? Do they have a tavern
at The Drowned Nest?

01:27:20.472 --> 01:27:24.523
MATT: "I'm sure you could acquire a drink. Trust
me, most of the folks here have to."

01:27:24.523 --> 01:27:30.330
TRAVIS: Do you feel safe here? I noticed your hood
was up when you approached us.

01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:34.360
MATT: "Just precautions. Not a lot of business
happens here that you won't get mingled in unless

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.683
"you were looking. So I just stay put."

01:27:37.683 --> 01:27:40.283
TRAVIS: We'll send word. It was good to see you.

01:27:40.283 --> 01:27:46.147
MATT: "You as well. If you pass by The Drowned
Nest, hopefully we could have a drink." And he

01:27:46.147 --> 01:27:49.251
makes his way up towards the central part of the
town, the Midway Docks.

01:27:49.251 --> 01:27:52.925
LAURA: Man, I'm glad he's alive. I thought he was
one of the dead bodies we found at the safe house.

01:27:52.925 --> 01:27:54.119
MARISHA: Me too.

01:27:54.119 --> 01:27:55.822
TRAVIS: Where the hell did Molly go?

01:27:55.822 --> 01:27:58.550
LAURA: He went in the apothecary! And I take off
running.

01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:05.410
MATT: You approach and there is a sign that's
hanging from a chain, from two iron hooks that are

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:11.384
long rusted, this dull brown-red color. It reads
across the front The Fungal Fount.

01:28:11.384 --> 01:28:14.914
TALIESIN: What kind of font is it written in?

01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:17.019
TRAVIS: Papyrus.

01:28:17.019 --> 01:28:23.593
MATT: Never enter if it's Papyrus.

01:28:23.593 --> 01:28:26.209
TRAVIS: No business back there!

01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:34.509
MATT: So you approach. The door is closed,
currently.

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:37.021
TALIESIN: I go to knock.

01:28:37.021 --> 01:28:41.120
MATT: "Sorry, we're closed."

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.388
TALIESIN: You're not buying today?

01:28:43.388 --> 01:28:47.126
MATT: "We're closed, it's sundown, and I'm
shutting up."

01:28:47.126 --> 01:28:51.182
TALIESIN: Already? What time do you open
tomorrow?

01:28:51.182 --> 01:28:52.521
MATT: "Sunrise."

01:28:52.521 --> 01:28:55.835
TALIESIN: Are you sure you don't want to perhaps
buy a fresh troll heart?

01:28:55.835 --> 01:28:58.873
MATT: (pause) "What?"

01:28:58.873 --> 01:29:01.551
LAURA: I have a troll heart. It's full of poison.

01:29:01.551 --> 01:29:02.828
TALIESIN: Very wet!

01:29:02.828 --> 01:29:04.253
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:29:04.253 --> 01:29:09.055
SAM: We got a real wet troll heart.

01:29:09.055 --> 01:29:11.019
LAURA: Do I roll with advantage because Molly is
helping?

01:29:11.019 --> 01:29:18.712
MATT: You are helping. I'll give you advantage on
this roll. That was a roller coaster right there.

01:29:18.712 --> 01:29:21.294
TALIESIN: Not a bad die there.

01:29:21.294 --> 01:29:24.398
LIAM: You two just became that Muppet meme that
was made.

01:29:24.398 --> 01:29:26.177
LAURA: 22!

01:29:26.177 --> 01:29:35.622
MATT: There's a moment and you hear (multiple
locks clicking). The door opens and on the inside

01:29:35.622 --> 01:29:42.803
you see a wild-looking, gaunt dwarf. He has a chin
beard with green moss growing on each side of it.

01:29:42.803 --> 01:29:47.704
His clothes look a little moist and his forehead
glistens with sweat, and he peers through, his

01:29:47.704 --> 01:29:57.501
eyes popped out. "You said you have a troll heart?
Come in." Opens the door and lets you both inside.

01:29:57.501 --> 01:30:05.543
Closes the door behind. (lock clicking) "I'm sort
of curious as to how you came across this troll

01:30:05.543 --> 01:30:07.197
"heart. Did you kill the troll?"

01:30:07.197 --> 01:30:08.370
LAURA: We killed a troll.

01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:09.678
TALIESIN: We found a troll and we killed it.

01:30:09.678 --> 01:30:13.111
MATT: "That's amazing. I'm very impressed. Um,
ah--"

01:30:13.111 --> 01:30:16.334
LAURA: Do you want to see it?

01:30:16.334 --> 01:30:20.888
MATT: "I would like to, very much. Place it on
this counter please. On the leather, which you carried."

01:30:20.888 --> 01:30:26.399
LAURA: I open the leather and place it down.
(squishy noise)

01:30:26.399 --> 01:30:29.882
MATT: He reaches over and grabs metal tongs and
starts pushing--

01:30:29.882 --> 01:30:30.928
LAURA: Hey!

01:30:30.928 --> 01:30:32.276
MATT: "I'm inspecting it."

01:30:32.276 --> 01:30:33.764
TALIESIN: Let him prod. It's fine.

01:30:33.764 --> 01:30:44.624
MATT: Takes a moment to look around. "I can see
there's some very fascinating applications that

01:30:44.624 --> 01:30:46.306
"could come from this."

01:30:46.306 --> 01:30:48.867
LAURA: There are a lot of aortas and chambers and
stuff.

01:30:48.867 --> 01:30:57.306
MATT: "It is quite exquisite. I would be happy to
buy this off of you. Do you have an asking price

01:30:57.306 --> 01:30:59.013
"or would you like me to make an offer?"

01:30:59.013 --> 01:31:01.972
TALIESIN: Or could we also talk about trade
possibly if you have some interesting stuff.

01:31:01.972 --> 01:31:04.662
LAURA: Probably you could buy it and also give us
some stuff.

01:31:04.662 --> 01:31:10.805
TALIESIN: If you've got stuff to trade. You seem
like a clever fellow, I'm sure you got something

01:31:10.805 --> 01:31:12.730
around here that's interesting and unique.

01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:16.350
MATT: Without breaking eye contact, he starts
rummaging behind this small wooden table that acts

01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:24.815
as his counter. Which has a bunch of planters and
potted weird-looking swamp fungus and plants that

01:31:24.815 --> 01:31:29.803
are grown together and entwined. One of them, you
lean close and a little spore goes off, and you

01:31:29.803 --> 01:31:37.461
back away carefully. You hear the clinking of
glass and he pulls up two small jars, opens and

01:31:37.461 --> 01:31:44.755
says, "I could spend the night preparing, perhaps,
for some medicinal potions. "

01:31:44.755 --> 01:31:48.176
LAURA: Really strong ones?

01:31:48.176 --> 01:31:50.972
MATT: "Strongest you'll find this side of the
Labenda."

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:56.239
LAURA: Is that regular? Or stronger than that?

01:31:56.239 --> 01:32:01.450
MATT: "I don't know, I have to brew it to find
out. It's not a perfect art form! You are impatient."

01:32:01.450 --> 01:32:08.104
TALIESIN: We'll see what you put together, and
we'll definitely talk about what this is worth in

01:32:08.104 --> 01:32:12.860
the morning. And if you have anything unusual that
you put together, if you have a signature blend of

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.802
any kind, I'm always interested in people who are
excited to experiment.

01:32:15.802 --> 01:32:17.339
MATT: "Unusual?"

01:32:17.339 --> 01:32:18.497
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:32:18.497 --> 01:32:20.537
LAURA: But I'm more interested in the healing
potions.

01:32:20.537 --> 01:32:21.922
TALIESIN: That too.

01:32:21.922 --> 01:32:25.998
MATT: "Right. The morning then."

01:32:25.998 --> 01:32:27.705
TALIESIN: We'll see you bright and early.

01:32:27.705 --> 01:32:31.342
LAURA: Take the troll-- what's your name by the
way?

01:32:31.342 --> 01:32:34.353
MATT: "Smithe. Smithe Durban. Pleasure to meet
you."

01:32:34.353 --> 01:32:35.802
LAURA: Smithe Durban.

01:32:35.802 --> 01:32:38.083
TALIESIN: Do you think it would be better to leave
this here, so he can contain it?

01:32:38.083 --> 01:32:39.352
LAURA: No!

01:32:39.352 --> 01:32:41.913
TALIESIN: I mean we killed a troll, it's not like
we can't kill him if it goes wrong.

01:32:41.913 --> 01:32:43.836
LAURA: Nope! I'm taking it with me.

01:32:43.836 --> 01:32:45.032
LIAM: Vex is back.

01:32:45.032 --> 01:32:51.887
SAM: Smithe Durban is, knows, or has a gimp.

01:32:51.887 --> 01:32:55.971
(laughter)

01:32:55.971 --> 01:32:58.657
TRAVIS: 100% for sure.

01:32:58.657 --> 01:33:01.853
TALIESIN: Why must you sully everything good and
pure in this world, Sam?

01:33:01.853 --> 01:33:07.436
LIAM: There is a halfling wrapped in parchment
paper underneath the shop.

01:33:07.436 --> 01:33:13.023
TALIESIN: This is where all those manacles have
been coming from! Oh no!

01:33:13.023 --> 01:33:16.381
MATT: They haven't invented the zipper yet, so
it's laced.

01:33:16.381 --> 01:33:22.656
TALIESIN: Perfect, we'll be back in the morning.
Let's go take a rest.

01:33:22.656 --> 01:33:28.439
MATT: "Very well. Goodnight, sleep well. Return
please." Closes the door. (multiple locks clicking)

01:33:28.439 --> 01:33:29.866
LAURA: What a nice guy.

01:33:29.866 --> 01:33:30.842
TALIESIN: I really liked him.

01:33:30.842 --> 01:33:32.178
LAURA: I did. I liked him a lot.

01:33:32.178 --> 01:33:35.886
MATT: So what are you guys doing for the evening?

01:33:35.886 --> 01:33:42.507
MARISHA: Let's go check out The Drowned Nest,
shall we? There is a better place than the

01:33:42.507 --> 01:33:45.966
Keystone Pub. We head to The Drowned Nest.

01:33:45.966 --> 01:33:53.028
MATT: You head to the Midway Docks. Following the
outskirts of the Drydocks, which are a number of

01:33:53.028 --> 01:33:56.730
these wooden docks that head out into various
edges of the swamp, where there are small boats

01:33:56.730 --> 01:34:00.936
that are currently roped off and being watched by
the crownsguard that come across with torches,

01:34:00.936 --> 01:34:07.473
make sure that nothing gets stolen or anyone is
doing anything untoward over in the area. Asking

01:34:07.473 --> 01:34:12.292
around, you eventually find your way to a
relatively simple-looking building. Single story,

01:34:12.292 --> 01:34:16.304
but it stretches quite a bit and you can see a
number of windows that are faintly glowing with

01:34:16.304 --> 01:34:24.253
candlelight. On the inside, it does appear to be
a simple inn, with a small bar in the far corner.

01:34:24.253 --> 01:34:34.145
It's better than the Keystone Pub, but only
incrementally. Entering inside, it's relatively

01:34:34.145 --> 01:34:40.462
quiet. Looks to be one person who is drinking
alone on the far end, and you see across the way a

01:34:40.462 --> 01:34:47.381
female human in her middle age, a warm smile with
a cracked face who glances up from a small book

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:51.524
that she is thumbing through and goes, "Good
evening folks. Can I help you?"

01:34:51.524 --> 01:34:59.411
TRAVIS: Yes, you can. We're weary travelers in need
of respite and perhaps some drinks.

01:34:59.411 --> 01:35:02.601
MATT: "Well, I can provide both. My name is Uma
Cole. Pleasure to meet you."

01:35:02.601 --> 01:35:03.960
TRAVIS: Uma. (kiss)

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.111
Matt: "Oh! Well--"

01:35:06.162 --> 01:35:07.718
TRAVIS: Was that a dirty hand?

01:35:07.718 --> 01:35:09.451
MATT: "Oh no, I keep quite clean."

01:35:09.451 --> 01:35:17.700
TRAVIS: I was asking out of character, but okay.
Did you give me the dirty hand, ma'am?

01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:25.811
MATT: I was trying to process what that was
referring to. "Oh, you stop." No, the hand was clean.

01:35:25.866 --> 01:35:27.147
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:35:27.147 --> 01:35:37.166
MATT: "We do have about four rooms available for
rent, if y'all are willing to stay for the evening.

01:35:37.166 --> 01:35:45.956
"Our selection of liquors and beers are not
extremely versatile, but welcome to provide as needed."

01:35:45.956 --> 01:35:49.029
TRAVIS: That sounds absolutely fantastic.

01:35:49.029 --> 01:35:51.522
TALIESIN: Whatever you think that we shouldn't
leave town without trying.

01:35:51.522 --> 01:35:56.183
MATT: "Very well. That will be five silver per
room for the night's stay."

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:57.513
MARISHA: We'll take them all.

01:35:57.513 --> 01:36:00.226
MATT: "All four rooms? That will be two gold
pieces, please."

01:36:00.226 --> 01:36:01.410
TRAVIS: I got it.

01:36:01.410 --> 01:36:02.486
TALIESIN: You got it?

01:36:02.486 --> 01:36:03.584
LAURA: Thanks, Fjord.

01:36:03.584 --> 01:36:06.708
TRAVIS: No problem. Thanks for making sure I was
okay back there.

01:36:06.708 --> 01:36:07.981
MATT: "What a gentleman."

01:36:07.981 --> 01:36:11.014
LAURA: I saved his life multiple times today.

01:36:11.014 --> 01:36:12.867
MATT: "Well, good for you."

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:16.476
TALIESIN: To be fair, he's saved our lives dozens of
times.

01:36:16.476 --> 01:36:24.969
MARISHA: He's very dapper. He touches the hearts
of all of us. Where would we be without Fjord?

01:36:24.969 --> 01:36:26.158
TALIESIN: All gone. All dead.

01:36:26.158 --> 01:36:30.634
LAURA: Yeah. I mean he's not that cool or
anything! I mean you probably wouldn't be

01:36:30.634 --> 01:36:32.784
interested in him at all.

01:36:32.784 --> 01:36:34.140
MATT: "Course not, I'm sorry."

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:37.583
LIAM: Are you interested in him?

01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:45.697
MATT: "Here're your keys." Strangely surrounded by
a group of strangers, now accosting her with

01:36:45.697 --> 01:36:55.421
various degrees of insinuation. "Drinks-wise, we
prefer more hard liquors, or more of an ale beer?"

01:36:55.421 --> 01:36:57.243
MARISHA, LIAM, and ASHLEY: Hard.

01:36:57.243 --> 01:36:59.319
TALIESIN: Any surprise you have.

01:36:59.319 --> 01:37:03.218
MATT: "Well, only a couple of surprises at my
disposal, but--"

01:37:03.218 --> 01:37:08.064
LAURA: Do you have any ginger ale, or fresh milk?

01:37:08.064 --> 01:37:15.773
MATT: She pulls up this dark green bottle, and
uncaps it. "It's beer, but its practically ginger

01:37:15.773 --> 01:37:19.457
"ale. Not very alcoholic." She hands it over to
you.

01:37:19.457 --> 01:37:22.168
TALIESIN: You can't drink in real life and you
still won't drink on graph paper.

01:37:22.168 --> 01:37:27.819
MATT: A round of liquor for all of you guys will
run you about three silver pieces. It's not very

01:37:27.819 --> 01:37:28.839
expensive.

01:37:28.839 --> 01:37:30.418
TRAVIS: I'll do that as well. It's exactly what I
have.

01:37:30.418 --> 01:37:32.025
ASHLEY: What book are you reading?

01:37:32.025 --> 01:37:43.174
MATT: "Oh, nothing." And she tucks it under. "Just
keeping my mind busy. Anyway, welcome to stay if

01:37:43.174 --> 01:37:49.839
"you like. We don't have food available here. You
may have to go over to the Keystone Pub for that.

01:37:49.839 --> 01:37:51.994
"But we do offer finer sleeping arrangements."

01:37:51.994 --> 01:37:57.059
TRAVIS: Is it a busy night? Any new travelers,
anyone that caught your eye coming in before us?

01:37:57.059 --> 01:37:59.692
MATT: "Not to the degree that you have, no."

01:37:59.692 --> 01:38:01.225
TRAVIS: Well, I'm flattered.

01:38:01.225 --> 01:38:07.409
MARISHA: Well, I'm going to go get a drink.

01:38:07.409 --> 01:38:11.605
TALIESIN: I've got cards, I'm going to play and
I'm going to drink. And we've got to discuss

01:38:11.605 --> 01:38:13.106
what's happening tomorrow.

01:38:13.106 --> 01:38:17.345
TRAVIS: True. We'll find our way over to a table.

01:38:17.345 --> 01:38:21.291
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll go get a table. Does someone
want to tuck Kiri in?

01:38:21.291 --> 01:38:24.946
MATT: Kiri at this point is leaning up on the
counter towards the woman. And goes (like Jester)

01:38:24.946 --> 01:38:31.389
"Don't eat humans, okay." The woman goes, "Aw!"

01:38:31.389 --> 01:38:35.858
LAURA: She's the sweetest, isn't she? She's
wearing a mask, she's not really a bird! And I

01:38:35.858 --> 01:38:37.734
take her.

01:38:37.734 --> 01:38:40.206
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:38:40.206 --> 01:38:46.698
LAURA: Oh! That's surprising, 20.

01:38:46.698 --> 01:38:50.361
MATT: She goes, "Children and their costumes."

01:38:50.361 --> 01:38:53.069
SAM: Yes, I know, right?

01:38:53.069 --> 01:38:55.840
(laughter)

01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:01.017
MATT: She grabs her book and starts reading from
behind the counter.

01:39:01.017 --> 01:39:03.298
TALIESIN: Can I see the cover when she grabs the
book?

01:39:03.298 --> 01:39:05.415
MATT: Actually, it's just plain leather.

01:39:05.415 --> 01:39:08.428
LAURA: (whispers) It's Tusk Love. That's
definitely Tusk Love.

01:39:08.428 --> 01:39:11.483
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

01:39:11.483 --> 01:39:13.656
TRAVIS: We head over to a table in the corner to
discuss.

01:39:13.656 --> 01:39:18.517
MATT: You got your drinks. They're functional at
best. This isn't a bad establishment, but it's a

01:39:18.517 --> 01:39:22.900
plain establishment. But it works. It's you guys
and one other patron, who currently seems to be

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:26.822
deep in their cups, making it on their own. They
are out of earshot; you have your own table.

01:39:26.822 --> 01:39:31.387
TRAVIS: Well, we seem to be doing fairly well. How
do we feel about setting out in the morning to--

01:39:31.387 --> 01:39:34.489
SAM: Shadycreek?

01:39:34.489 --> 01:39:36.240
TRAVIS: Yeah, Shadycreek Run.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.430
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm ready.

01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:38.746
TRAVIS: Ophelia Mardun.

01:39:38.746 --> 01:39:39.828
LAURA: Sounds good.

01:39:39.828 --> 01:39:43.017
SAM: Was there anyone else here that we were
supposed to see, or anything else we were supposed

01:39:43.017 --> 01:39:43.939
to do?

01:39:43.939 --> 01:39:45.535
LIAM: No, we are on a bit of a time crunch.

01:39:45.535 --> 01:39:49.840
SAM: We have to stop by this fungus place to get
some potions.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.297
TALIESIN: We'll do that on the way out as soon as
we put the cart together.

01:39:52.297 --> 01:39:53.864
LAURA: It opens at sunrise so we should be good.

01:39:53.864 --> 01:40:02.742
TALIESIN: We've done what we needed. This is a one
troll town, I think. Not a great time to be had here.

01:40:02.742 --> 01:40:09.775
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can catch up on some rest. We got
to get the carriage, right? Get the horses back.

01:40:09.775 --> 01:40:12.614
LAURA: Yeah, they're at the docks or something.

01:40:12.614 --> 01:40:16.465
TRAVIS: That means I got to go over to the-- Where
did we stay before?

01:40:16.465 --> 01:40:18.682
MARISHA: The Keystone Pub.

01:40:18.682 --> 01:40:20.581
TRAVIS: I've got to get it from that guy.

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:23.118
LAURA: He dropped them off at the place--

01:40:23.118 --> 01:40:24.530
SAM: The central stables.

01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:27.044
MARISHA: We paid way too much money to have him
store our horses.

01:40:27.044 --> 01:40:28.496
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we don't know where the stables
are.

01:40:28.496 --> 01:40:31.610
LAURA: The central stables, we have to ask where
they are. We don't have to go back to the other

01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:33.311
pub. Don't worry, Fjord.

01:40:33.311 --> 01:40:34.798
TALIESIN: They may not give them to us unless he's
there.

01:40:34.798 --> 01:40:37.506
SAM: Hey, Yasha.

01:40:37.506 --> 01:40:39.486
MARISHA: I have validation, it's okay.

01:40:39.486 --> 01:40:47.479
SAM: Yasha, I saw you asking about that book the
lady had.

01:40:47.479 --> 01:40:48.904
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:40:48.904 --> 01:40:50.084
SAM: Do you want me to get it for you?

01:40:50.084 --> 01:40:54.304
ASHLEY: Yes. I would love that.

01:40:54.304 --> 01:40:55.540
SAM: All right.

01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:56.467
TALIESIN: I missed this.

01:40:56.467 --> 01:41:00.638
SAM: Maybe place an order or get her attention so
I can go snag it real quick.

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:03.429
ASHLEY: Okay, would you like me to try to--

01:41:03.429 --> 01:41:04.513
SAM: I don't know.

01:41:04.513 --> 01:41:05.717
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:41:05.717 --> 01:41:07.173
SAM: I'll cast Mage Hand.

01:41:07.173 --> 01:41:15.439
TALIESIN: Oh, why not? Another round, please! And
I'll put a gold for everyone down.

01:41:15.439 --> 01:41:21.935
MATT: Okay, she goes, "Oh, of course, I'll go
ahead and get that for you." She closes the book

01:41:21.935 --> 01:41:26.499
and puts it beneath the counter and runs off and
grabs the bottle that she had previously poured

01:41:26.499 --> 01:41:30.676
and shakes it. It's fairly empty, so she grabs
another and then heads over to your table and

01:41:30.676 --> 01:41:32.463
begins to uncork and fill the drinks.

01:41:32.463 --> 01:41:35.948
SAM: As she's filling, I'll Mage Hand back and try
to grab the book.

01:41:35.948 --> 01:41:38.706
MATT: Okay, you do not see where it is. You still
have to have visual.

01:41:38.706 --> 01:41:40.247
SAM: Okay, I'll walk over there, then.

01:41:40.247 --> 01:41:41.716
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:41:41.716 --> 01:41:44.671
SAM: That's not great. 14.

01:41:44.671 --> 01:41:47.285
ASHLEY: You could just be looking.

01:41:47.285 --> 01:41:52.467
MATT: Okay, she walks and is pouring drinks and
looks over her shoulder in your direction, and is

01:41:52.467 --> 01:41:54.905
still pouring, but is looking at you.

01:41:54.905 --> 01:41:58.205
LAURA: Kids, huh? They're always wandering off.

01:41:58.205 --> 01:41:59.699
MATT: "Apparently."

01:41:59.699 --> 01:42:07.323
SAM: Goo goo ga ga. Do I see where the book is
now?

01:42:07.323 --> 01:42:09.517
MATT: You do see it from your perspective, but she
is watching you.

01:42:09.517 --> 01:42:13.041
TRAVIS: Uma, has anyone ever told you that you
have eyes like the sea?

01:42:13.041 --> 01:42:15.639
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:42:15.639 --> 01:42:18.448
SAM: (imitating guitar)

01:42:18.448 --> 01:42:24.536
TRAVIS: Shit, nine. Come on, that's my jam!

01:42:24.536 --> 01:42:28.667
ASHLEY: Yes, Uma, they are like a sky blue.

01:42:28.667 --> 01:42:34.398
MATT: She finishes pouring the drinks, caps it up,
and goes, "Well, I appreciate the flattery, I

01:42:34.398 --> 01:42:39.315
"really do. Have a wonderful night." Then walks
back towards where she was sitting, but as she

01:42:39.315 --> 01:42:43.920
does so, her eyes are locked on you, Nott. Goes
back to her stool.

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:51.254
SAM: Damn it! Fjord, what was that? What was that?
That's not how you talk to a woman!

01:42:51.254 --> 01:42:53.950
TRAVIS: I'm not real practiced, I'm sorry.

01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:59.418
SAM: "Your eyes are like the sea?" We're in a
landlocked part of the place here. She doesn't

01:42:59.418 --> 01:43:00.827
even know what that means.

01:43:00.827 --> 01:43:06.686
TRAVIS: I should've said like the swamp, right?
Your eyes are like stagnant water, green and-- no?

01:43:06.686 --> 01:43:08.904
Green and yellow in places.

01:43:08.904 --> 01:43:12.444
LIAM: I walk directly up to the bar.

01:43:12.444 --> 01:43:14.969
LAURA: They look like a troll took a shit in them.

01:43:14.969 --> 01:43:16.429
MATT: "Can I help you?"

01:43:16.429 --> 01:43:21.153
LIAM: Yeah, I'm good on drinks. I was just curious
what it is that you're reading.

01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:22.638
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

01:43:22.638 --> 01:43:26.172
LIAM: For a question? Okay.

01:43:26.172 --> 01:43:27.357
LAURA: She doesn't like us very much.

01:43:27.357 --> 01:43:28.390
MARISHA: Yeah, she hates us.

01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:30.430
MATT: She's had a bad series of minutes with you
guys.

01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:31.521
LIAM: Just a nine.

01:43:31.521 --> 01:43:37.127
MATT: "I'm reading a fine story."

01:43:37.127 --> 01:43:38.976
LIAM: Is it fiction?

01:43:38.976 --> 01:43:39.974
MATT: "It is."

01:43:39.974 --> 01:43:44.246
LIAM: I am so starved for a good book. We've been
in the wild for a while. I don't suppose there's--

01:43:44.246 --> 01:43:48.167
I doubt it, but is there any place to find
literature here?

01:43:48.167 --> 01:43:51.622
MATT: "I had to order this from Zadash,
unfortunately."

01:43:51.622 --> 01:43:54.421
LIAM: That sounds terrible. How long does it take
for it to get here?

01:43:54.421 --> 01:44:00.438
MATT: "Well, the order goes out there, and pay
upon delivery. It took me the better part of a

01:44:00.438 --> 01:44:02.075
"month to get here."

01:44:02.075 --> 01:44:11.873
LIAM: I commiserate for your thirst for fiction. I
struggle with it myself. How far in are you? Are

01:44:11.873 --> 01:44:13.220
you almost finished with it?

01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:17.285
MATT: "I'm about three chapters in. It's just
starting to get interesting."

01:44:17.285 --> 01:44:18.496
LIAM: Is it a page turner?

01:44:18.496 --> 01:44:19.877
MATT: "Yes."

01:44:19.877 --> 01:44:26.063
LIAM: Okay, I'm obviously just a little bit
jealous, but I don't want to take you away from

01:44:26.063 --> 01:44:27.194
your reading time.

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:29.273
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:44:29.273 --> 01:44:30.950
LIAM: Nine.

01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:37.312
MATT: There's a little bit of text just barely
visible at this proximity to the cover of the

01:44:37.312 --> 01:44:39.537
book, but you can't make it out in this low
light.

01:44:39.537 --> 01:44:45.040
LAURA: Does it look like a T, with a U, with an S,
with a K. With an L--

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.889
MATT: She takes it and closes it and puts it
beneath the counter. "Is there anything else I can

01:44:49.889 --> 01:44:51.083
"help you with, sweetie?"

01:44:51.083 --> 01:44:53.740
LIAM: No, that's fine, enjoy. I give her a wink
and I go back to the table.

01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:55.179
ASHLEY: This is going to drive me crazy.

01:44:55.179 --> 01:45:01.117
SAM: Let's fucking kill her and take the book,
take everything in the place!

01:45:01.117 --> 01:45:03.138
MARISHA: We have been wanting to buy a bar.

01:45:03.138 --> 01:45:07.774
TRAVIS: Yeah, but you know what they say, it's
location, location, location.

01:45:07.774 --> 01:45:09.255
MARISHA: Yeah, this town sucks.

01:45:09.255 --> 01:45:10.626
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's really not that good.

01:45:10.626 --> 01:45:11.873
ASHLEY: I'm going to go up to the bar.

01:45:11.873 --> 01:45:19.418
MATT: She's just pulled the book out and looks up
and goes, "Hi."

01:45:19.418 --> 01:45:23.646
ASHLEY: Hello. Here's the thing. You've made this
very intriguing, this book that you're reading,

01:45:23.646 --> 01:45:27.782
and I can't leave here without knowing what it is.

01:45:27.782 --> 01:45:30.472
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:45:30.472 --> 01:45:33.529
MARISHA: Were you being intimidating?

01:45:33.529 --> 01:45:35.972
TRAVIS: The brachial artery flexes in her bicep.

01:45:35.972 --> 01:45:37.744
ASHLEY: My intimidation is minus two but we said
we can use--

01:45:37.744 --> 01:45:42.484
MATT: Well, it depends on how you're being
intimidating. Are you going to physically threaten

01:45:42.484 --> 01:45:43.641
her to show the book?

01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:44.634
ASHLEY: No, no.

01:45:44.634 --> 01:45:46.015
MATT: Then it's charisma-based.

01:45:46.015 --> 01:45:47.318
LAURA: You got this, Yasha!

01:45:47.318 --> 01:45:48.466
MATT: This is subtle.

01:45:48.466 --> 01:45:50.478
TALIESIN: No.

01:45:50.478 --> 01:45:58.467
ASHLEY: That would be a zero. Because I rolled a
two, and my charisma is minus two.

01:45:58.467 --> 01:46:04.934
MATT: She goes, "I apologize, but--" (southern
drawl) I apologize.

01:46:04.934 --> 01:46:10.502
ALL: (southern drawl) I apologize.

01:46:10.502 --> 01:46:21.180
MATT: "But your behavior, paid customer or not,
has been lackluster, and I would appreciate if I

01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:22.743
"could have my privacy."

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:27.195
ASHLEY: I will give you privacy, I just don't
understand why we can't know what you're reading.

01:46:27.195 --> 01:46:30.032
MATT: "Why are you so interested in what I'm
reading?"

01:46:30.032 --> 01:46:42.249
ASHLEY: Because it looks like it's very good! I
will go sit down, fine. I miss reading. I miss it

01:46:42.249 --> 01:46:43.426
a lot.

01:46:43.426 --> 01:46:47.262
LAURA: I have a book you can read, Yasha.

01:46:47.262 --> 01:46:49.216
ASHLEY: I want to know what she's reading.

01:46:49.216 --> 01:46:52.176
SAM: Jester and Molly, you have not tried yet.

01:46:52.176 --> 01:46:56.194
MATT: Dungeons and Dragons.

01:46:56.194 --> 01:47:00.894
LIAM: We plan a heist for tonight. We wait until
she's asleep.

01:47:00.894 --> 01:47:05.914
TRAVIS: In the morning, we'll send her for the
horses and the carriage, and perhaps it's time we

01:47:05.914 --> 01:47:12.317
turn in. I pound mine. Molly, are we bunking up?

01:47:12.317 --> 01:47:14.059
TALIESIN: I'm finishing this and I'll be right
up.

01:47:14.059 --> 01:47:16.968
MATT: All right. You guys finish up your
respective drinks.

01:47:16.968 --> 01:47:18.332
TALIESIN: I go last.

01:47:18.332 --> 01:47:20.056
LAURA: I feel like we only need three rooms.

01:47:20.056 --> 01:47:23.076
SAM: It's just an extra couple gold.

01:47:23.076 --> 01:47:27.897
TALIESIN: I leave two gold on the counter before I
leave. For you no matter what, but if you tell me

01:47:27.897 --> 01:47:32.019
what it is, I promise I won't tell the rest of
them. I just want to lord it over them.

01:47:32.019 --> 01:47:39.625
MATT: She palms the two gold. She goes, "It's
called Feathered Leather."

01:47:39.625 --> 01:47:47.981
TALIESIN: Enjoy your evening. Cheers. And I head
upstairs.

01:47:47.981 --> 01:47:49.553
MATT: She pockets the gold happily.

01:47:49.553 --> 01:47:51.331
LIAM: It's about Vax.

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:54.463
(laughter)

01:47:54.463 --> 01:48:07.044
MATT: Some bard somewhere in the past has penned a
story about a dark knight in leather and feathers.

01:48:07.044 --> 01:48:08.821
MARISHA: I've seen that Tumblr post.

01:48:08.821 --> 01:48:11.986
TALIESIN: For the record, I tell none of you.

01:48:11.986 --> 01:48:16.976
MATT: You guys manage to get your evening's rest.
You gather your things, and the next morning--

01:48:16.976 --> 01:48:25.719
LAURA: Wait, before I go to sleep, I want to use
my Pearl of Power and regain a 3rd-level spell,

01:48:25.771 --> 01:48:35.067
and I want to cast Sending on my Mama. And I'm
going to say: Hi, Mom! I got a new spell. I want

01:48:35.067 --> 01:48:39.781
to say thank you for the package you sent me. I
know that it was really hard for you to do that

01:48:39.781 --> 01:48:44.876
and I love you so much and I hope everything's
okay with you, and I got your letter and the ink

01:48:44.876 --> 01:48:46.613
and I think it's so--

01:48:46.613 --> 01:49:05.549
MATT: As you're talking, you hear, in your mind,
this gasp. "Jester, I don't know how, but it's so

01:49:05.549 --> 01:49:08.228
"good to hear from you. Did you get my package?"

01:49:08.228 --> 01:49:12.475
LAURA: Oh no, can I respond to it? Oh no!

01:49:12.475 --> 01:49:29.164
MATT: She pauses. "Well, wherever you are, I love
you, and I hope you are well, If--" and it cuts off.

01:49:29.164 --> 01:49:31.381
ALL: (groaning)

01:49:31.381 --> 01:49:38.757
MARISHA: Maybe next time if you write down the
words, so you can know which are the most

01:49:38.757 --> 01:49:40.260
important words.

01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.381
LAURA: Okay, I need to tell her I got her package.

01:49:42.381 --> 01:49:47.976
MATT: I wasn't counting the words, but I think
that gets the gist of it. Probably somewhere in

01:49:47.976 --> 01:49:53.219
there. I'm sure I'll get 14 tweets going like,
"That was only 22 words." It's fine.

01:49:53.219 --> 01:49:55.078
TALIESIN: Three of those tweets will be from me.

01:49:55.078 --> 01:49:58.659
MATT: I know. Oh, I know, Taliesin. That's why I'm
nipping this in the bud. Yeah.

01:49:58.659 --> 01:50:03.185
TRAVIS: Before we turn in turn in, it's just Molly and I
in our room, right?

01:50:03.201 --> 01:50:05.800
Can I confide in you for something?

01:50:05.852 --> 01:50:07.399
TALIESIN: Oh yes, please.

01:50:07.399 --> 01:50:16.356
TRAVIS: I'm a little unnerved about this sword.
Would you stay and watch for a second?

01:50:16.356 --> 01:50:20.958
TALIESIN: This seems like a bad idea. Sure.

01:50:20.958 --> 01:50:23.761
TRAVIS: All right. I'll summon the Wastehunter
Falchion.

01:50:23.761 --> 01:50:29.003
MATT: As it emerges from your grasp, you can see
there's the slight splash of sea water across the

01:50:29.003 --> 01:50:37.120
wall. There you can see, in the center of the
pommel-- previously was just the well-crafted hilt

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.478
to the blade-- you see a single, yellow, lidless
eye on each side.

01:50:40.478 --> 01:50:46.908
TALIESIN: Does it look like anything? Does it
remind me of a mystic symbol of any kind?

01:50:46.908 --> 01:50:52.933
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:50:52.933 --> 01:50:59.190
TALIESIN: Just an arcana check. Let's see what
happens. Natural 20.

01:50:59.190 --> 01:51:00.473
LAURA: Whoa!

01:51:00.473 --> 01:51:01.719
TALIESIN: I'm back, baby.

01:51:01.719 --> 01:51:16.627
MATT: There's no religious symbology here. In
thinking through, there's nothing that gives you

01:51:16.627 --> 01:51:26.059
the essence that there's any sort of belief system
locked into this that you're aware of. Looking at

01:51:26.059 --> 01:51:36.129
it, one: it immediately reminds you of whatever it
is he jammed into his stomach, and two: the image

01:51:36.129 --> 01:51:45.762
of it, and the sea-based theme of these experiences
that Fjord has been having, leads you to believe

01:51:45.762 --> 01:52:00.329
that this is something very old, and something
that resides probably beyond land and possibly

01:52:00.329 --> 01:52:07.830
beyond the sea. That's as much as I can give you.
Which is more than you should've gotten, but you

01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:09.519
rolled a 20.

01:52:09.519 --> 01:52:14.176
TRAVIS: Does the iris move at all, or is it
static?

01:52:14.176 --> 01:52:16.404
MATT: Currently it's just static.

01:52:16.404 --> 01:52:18.847
TALIESIN: What happened to you on that boat?

01:52:18.847 --> 01:52:21.868
TRAVIS: Um.

01:52:21.868 --> 01:52:23.882
TALIESIN: Something might have followed you.

01:52:23.882 --> 01:52:32.012
TRAVIS: Nothing like this. I've never seen
anything like this eye before. Only in that dream,

01:52:32.012 --> 01:52:39.406
where Vander was holding it, pushing it into his
chest, but this is smaller. This sword just seems

01:52:39.406 --> 01:52:44.040
to take in things.

01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:49.827
TALIESIN: You're going to forgive me for this
later. I cast Friends.

01:52:49.827 --> 01:52:55.653
MATT: Okay. For the next minute, you have
advantage on your charisma checks.

01:52:55.653 --> 01:52:58.071
TRAVIS: I forget what Friends does.

01:52:58.071 --> 01:53:01.159
MATT: It doesn't do anything to you, it just gives
him advantage on charisma checks.

01:53:01.159 --> 01:53:02.363
TRAVIS: Oh okay. Oh nice.

01:53:02.363 --> 01:53:05.460
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm so sorry, not Friends,
it's Charm Person.

01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:06.532
MATT: You're doing Charm Person?

01:53:06.532 --> 01:53:07.713
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, it's Charm Person.

01:53:07.713 --> 01:53:08.728
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:53:08.728 --> 01:53:09.484
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:53:09.484 --> 01:53:14.619
TRAVIS: Why did I ask? That's an 18.

01:53:14.619 --> 01:53:22.861
MATT: He resists it. You feel your mind begin to
cool with subtle arcane influence and you shrug it off.

01:53:22.861 --> 01:53:28.467
TALIESIN: There's something in you that you either
don't want to talk about or don't remember

01:53:28.467 --> 01:53:29.975
properly, I think.

01:53:29.975 --> 01:53:32.071
TRAVIS: Well, you could've just asked.

01:53:32.071 --> 01:53:33.497
TALIESIN: No, I don't think I could've.

01:53:33.497 --> 01:53:35.446
TRAVIS: If anything, it's the latter.

01:53:35.446 --> 01:53:36.644
TALIESIN: I know.

01:53:36.644 --> 01:53:38.889
TRAVIS: There's not a lot I remember about being
in the ocean.

01:53:38.889 --> 01:53:40.648
TALIESIN: Which is why I didn't ask.

01:53:40.648 --> 01:53:42.410
TRAVIS: Right.

01:53:42.410 --> 01:53:46.404
TALIESIN: I trust that you'll tell me everything
you know, but I'm not sure you even know

01:53:46.404 --> 01:53:47.642
everything you know.

01:53:47.642 --> 01:53:53.269
TRAVIS: Maybe, but that's why I asked you to stay
in the room. I'm not entirely sure I trust this thing.

01:53:53.269 --> 01:53:56.660
TALIESIN: I don't think it matters where the sword
is at all.

01:53:56.660 --> 01:54:06.990
TRAVIS: Maybe. Can I try and focus on the sword? I
close my eyes, put both hands on the hilt, and

01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:10.738
just concentrate on it real hard?

01:54:10.738 --> 01:54:16.757
(laughter)

01:54:16.757 --> 01:54:25.642
MATT: Sword of Sea Eye, give me sight beyond
sight. Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

01:54:25.642 --> 01:54:28.877
Just a straight roll with your intelligence
modifier.

01:54:28.877 --> 01:54:35.216
TRAVIS: Oh. That's a ten.

01:54:35.216 --> 01:54:43.318
MATT: Ten. You grab it and you focus, and you
focus, and much like an element of the dreams

01:54:43.318 --> 01:54:51.093
you've had and the spells that you pull from
whatever this agreement you've made with this

01:54:51.093 --> 01:54:57.234
entity may have been, you can feel that thread
connection from you to something beyond your

01:54:57.234 --> 01:55:02.316
hemisphere. It's like that sensation of someone
looking at you, and you just know someone's

01:55:02.316 --> 01:55:07.356
looking at you, and you turn to look and there's
nobody's there? It's like that, all the time,

01:55:07.356 --> 01:55:12.036
right now. But, you can't read more than that.

01:55:12.036 --> 01:55:14.071
TALIESIN: Perhaps, I think, may I?

01:55:14.071 --> 01:55:28.301
TRAVIS: Don't take any offense, but no. I make it
disappear.

01:55:28.301 --> 01:55:35.657
TALIESIN: Something from the deep is in that. I
don't know. It reminds me of something.

01:55:35.657 --> 01:55:46.835
TRAVIS: Yeah. Me too. I'm just not sure what.
Please, I only confided in you because I feel like

01:55:46.835 --> 01:55:49.200
the strange is your ballpark.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:56.307
TALIESIN: I'll keep an eye, and no matter what,
keeping each other safe, it's what we do. It's

01:55:56.307 --> 01:55:58.107
what you do when you got a group of people.

01:55:58.107 --> 01:55:59.241
TRAVIS: Agreed.

01:55:59.241 --> 01:56:00.443
TALIESIN: We'll keep you safe.

01:56:00.443 --> 01:56:05.571
TRAVIS: I appreciate it, Molly. I'll turn in.

01:56:05.571 --> 01:56:08.690
TALIESIN: I'll probably be up for an hour, then
I'll turn in.

01:56:08.690 --> 01:56:14.789
MATT: Okay. As we go to rest for the evening,
let's go ahead and make this our break! So, we'll

01:56:14.789 --> 01:56:19.154
come back here in just a few minutes to pick up
the story for the next leg of your journey. In the

01:56:19.154 --> 01:56:25.223
meantime, guys, enjoy these next few minutes.
Enjoy the videos and chaos in between. We'll see

01:56:25.223 --> 01:56:26.861
you here shortly.

01:56:29.711 --> 01:56:36.542
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. Let's go ahead and
dive back in. As you all come to consciousness the

01:56:37.042 --> 01:56:42.096
following morning, a much more comfortable sleep
than that you had at the Keystone Pub, you

01:56:42.096 --> 01:56:47.560
gather your things. Upstairs, there are a few more
patrons in the process of waking up since there is

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:54.187
not a meal provided for sleeping here. They are
just getting out the grogginess, having some

01:56:54.187 --> 01:56:57.729
coffee, some of them having some hair of the dog,
and they all go about their business. What do you

01:56:57.729 --> 01:56:59.335
want to do with your day?

01:56:59.335 --> 01:57:01.679
LAURA: We have to go to that shop, Molly.

01:57:01.679 --> 01:57:07.438
TALIESIN: Let's go to the shop, everybody. Anybody
wants to go shopping can go shopping. Anybody else

01:57:07.438 --> 01:57:08.963
wants to wrangle up the cart?

01:57:08.963 --> 01:57:10.102
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go with you guys.

01:57:10.102 --> 01:57:12.878
TRAVIS: I'll tell Uma to go collect the cart and
horses from the--

01:57:12.878 --> 01:57:14.655
LAURA: You have to pay her to do it too.

01:57:14.655 --> 01:57:15.775
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll pay her.

01:57:15.775 --> 01:57:25.533
MATT: Okay. She goes, "To pick up your money at
the stables, you say, on the docks, how can I

01:57:25.533 --> 01:57:29.214
"assure them that I'm allowed to do so if I did not
check them in?"

01:57:29.214 --> 01:57:31.856
MARISHA: It is what you said!

01:57:31.856 --> 01:57:33.474
TALIESIN: We need a valet ticket.

01:57:33.474 --> 01:57:36.342
MARISHA: We do need a valet ticket. Did we get a
valet ticket?

01:57:36.342 --> 01:57:39.393
SAM: I don't think that we did.

01:57:39.393 --> 01:57:44.022
LAURA: I write a valet ticket really fast. Here
you go! That's--

01:57:44.022 --> 01:57:44.953
MATT: You forge it?

01:57:44.953 --> 01:57:45.776
LAURA: Yep.

01:57:45.776 --> 01:57:46.780
MATT: You have a forgery kit?

01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:47.953
LAURA: I do.

01:57:47.953 --> 01:57:50.644
TRAVIS: We're not going to forge--

01:57:50.644 --> 01:57:53.437
TALIESIN: As much as I'm kind of into this--

01:57:53.437 --> 01:57:57.225
MARISHA: Look, if we don't have one, you have to
pay full price if you lose it.

01:57:57.225 --> 01:57:59.924
TRAVIS: Or we just kill them. I'll go down and
get it myself.

01:57:59.924 --> 01:58:02.416
LAURA: But you might have to go--

01:58:02.416 --> 01:58:04.120
TRAVIS: And then I'll kill them.

01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:06.681
ASHLEY: You know what? I'm going to go with Fjord
to get the cart.

01:58:06.681 --> 01:58:10.429
TALIESIN: Why don't you all meet us at the-- get
the cart and you'll meet us at the apothecary.

01:58:10.429 --> 01:58:14.462
ASHLEY: Okay. Just in case you need backup. If we
need to kill them, we can.

01:58:14.462 --> 01:58:15.722
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:58:15.722 --> 01:58:20.093
MATT: All right. You guys go ahead and head off. You
gather the cart, easy enough to do. You gather

01:58:20.093 --> 01:58:25.630
your supplies, they're all good to go. You guys
are heading towards the Fungal Fount?

01:58:25.630 --> 01:58:26.766
LAURA: We are!

01:58:26.785 --> 01:58:28.905
SAM: Get a lot of healing potions! Oh, are we all
going?

01:58:28.905 --> 01:58:30.562
MARISHA: Yeah, the rest of us.

01:58:30.562 --> 01:58:33.287
LIAM: No, I want to go for a walk on the edge of
town for something.

01:58:33.287 --> 01:58:35.431
MARISHA: Hey, will you take Kiri with you?

01:58:35.431 --> 01:58:36.742
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

01:58:36.742 --> 01:58:37.871
MARISHA: All right.

01:58:37.871 --> 01:58:39.588
SAM: You want me to come as well?

01:58:39.588 --> 01:58:40.703
LIAM: Yeah, of course!

01:58:40.703 --> 01:58:42.569
SAM: Get a lot of healing potions!

01:58:42.569 --> 01:58:43.123
LAURA: I'm going to!

01:58:43.123 --> 01:58:44.939
SAM: Okay.

01:58:44.939 --> 01:58:46.473
TALIESIN: Meet us at the apothecary.

01:58:46.473 --> 01:58:48.577
MATT: Kiri pipes up. She says, (as Jester) "Get
into trouble."

01:58:48.577 --> 01:58:51.405
LIAM: No, we are not going to get in trouble.

01:58:51.405 --> 01:58:52.845
MATT: (as Jester) "Get into trouble."

01:58:52.845 --> 01:58:53.859
LIAM: Nein!

01:58:53.859 --> 01:58:55.394
MATT: (cooing)

01:58:55.394 --> 01:58:57.077
LIAM: Nein.

01:58:57.077 --> 01:58:58.591
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's so cute.

01:58:58.591 --> 01:59:03.002
LIAM: Be good. Just going on a stroll, ja? We're
not going to kill anything, you're not going to,

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:05.343
you know. Just taking a walk.

01:59:05.343 --> 01:59:07.472
MATT: (as Caleb) "You know. Okay!"

01:59:07.472 --> 01:59:10.701
LIAM: You are pretty cute. Come on.

01:59:10.701 --> 01:59:14.440
MATT: Turns to Nott as you guys walk off.
(whispers) "Wrapped around his weenie!"

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.449
(laughter)

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:19.604
MATT: You continue making your way to the edge
of the swamp. The two of you--

01:59:19.626 --> 01:59:20.982
MARISHA: She's our new brand mascot.

01:59:20.982 --> 01:59:25.875
MATT: You guys make your way to the Fungal Fount.
The doorway is partially ajar. It is open.

01:59:25.875 --> 01:59:33.057
MARISHA: As we walk there, I, to the rest of these
four, three, say-- no! You're not there. To these

01:59:33.057 --> 01:59:37.423
two, say, all right, guys. Real talk. What are we
going to do with Kiri?

01:59:37.423 --> 01:59:39.249
TALIESIN: I've been thinking about that.

01:59:39.249 --> 01:59:40.831
MARISHA: We can't keep her with us.

01:59:40.831 --> 01:59:42.639
LAURA: Why not?

01:59:42.639 --> 01:59:44.478
MARISHA: She's going to die.

01:59:44.478 --> 01:59:45.698
TALIESIN: In front of you.

01:59:45.698 --> 01:59:49.195
MARISHA: Bloody. Horribly. Brutally.

01:59:49.195 --> 01:59:51.288
LAURA: Oh, man.

01:59:51.288 --> 01:59:54.669
MARISHA: You're going to be real sad about it. So
we got to let her go.

01:59:54.669 --> 01:59:56.176
LAURA: We can't just let her go!

01:59:56.176 --> 02:00:02.024
MARISHA: No, we can't let her go. But I'm saying
we have to let her go from our group. Somewhere safe.

02:00:02.024 --> 02:00:08.979
LAURA: What if I try to get a hold of her parents
or something?

02:00:08.979 --> 02:00:12.397
MARISHA: Can you do that? Do you need to know who
her parents are?

02:00:12.397 --> 02:00:13.799
TRAVIS: Aren't they dead?

02:00:13.799 --> 02:00:19.595
MARISHA: No, they got separated. But we don't know
yet.

02:00:19.595 --> 02:00:25.187
TALIESIN: But we have a map and maybe she can show
us on the map where she thinks she needs to go?

02:00:25.187 --> 02:00:29.732
LAURA: We can't just-- what are we going to do?
Just send her on her way by herself?

02:00:29.732 --> 02:00:33.765
TALIESIN: No! I didn't say that. I said if we know
which direction she needs to head, we can figure

02:00:33.765 --> 02:00:35.426
out possibly if we can get her there.

02:00:35.426 --> 02:00:36.803
LAURA: Okay.

02:00:36.803 --> 02:00:42.543
MARISHA: I think we need to get her out of this
swamp, because this place is terrible. And I

02:00:42.543 --> 02:00:43.657
wouldn't want to live here.

02:00:43.657 --> 02:00:44.661
TALIESIN: No one should live here.

02:00:44.661 --> 02:00:47.069
MARISHA: I'm not going to subject a poor little
child bird to that.

02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:51.818
TALIESIN: She does drink a lot and occasionally
seem interested in eating human flesh. I'm not

02:00:51.818 --> 02:00:54.445
entirely-- well, that's a subject for another
day.

02:00:54.445 --> 02:00:55.982
MARISHA: You're right! She could grow up and run
this town.

02:00:55.982 --> 02:00:58.894
LAURA: She could be like her own Gentleman.

02:00:58.894 --> 02:01:00.461
MARISHA: Oh my god, she's her own mob boss.

02:01:00.461 --> 02:01:02.480
LAURA: (gasps) I hope so.

02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:05.341
MARISHA: I like that. I have high hopes for her.
Yeah.

02:01:05.341 --> 02:01:13.343
LAURA: Maybe I can talk to her and have her write
down exactly what her parents look like or

02:01:13.343 --> 02:01:16.228
something and I can try to send a message to them?

02:01:16.228 --> 02:01:20.829
MARISHA: Okay. I think that'd be good. We'll start
there. Put a pin in this for now.

02:01:20.829 --> 02:01:22.164
TRAVIS: Just draw some birds.

02:01:22.164 --> 02:01:25.130
LAURA: They're birds.

02:01:25.130 --> 02:01:30.049
TALIESIN: Birds. You know, there's a bird in a
bonnet and another one smoking a pipe. That's all

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:37.820
I really-- (coos) Just think about that. Yeah.

02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:44.477
MATT: You guys make your way into the Fungal Fount,
and there you see, waiting anxiously, there's the

02:01:44.477 --> 02:01:53.935
sallow dwarf sitting in a small chair in the
corner going, "Ah, so, where is the heart? Did you

02:01:53.935 --> 02:01:55.070
"bring it?"

02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:56.555
LAURA: Right here.

02:01:56.555 --> 02:02:01.847
MATT: "Right, okay. So I've been working on
something for you based on what you requested and

02:02:01.847 --> 02:02:08.424
"I have these." He puts these two vials on the
table. One of them is a healing potion, larger

02:02:08.424 --> 02:02:20.849
than the basic kind. The other is a sky blue
color, and as he sets it on the table, as soon as it

02:02:20.849 --> 02:02:26.090
impacts, there's a flash and you see some sparkles
kind of going (energy crackling) through it before

02:02:26.090 --> 02:02:32.452
it settles. And he goes, "I'm going to be honest,
not entirely certain the extent of what this is.

02:02:32.452 --> 02:02:39.108
"It protects you from something. I know the basis
of it is insulation."

02:02:39.108 --> 02:02:42.403
LAURA: What's the gold stuff in there?

02:02:42.403 --> 02:02:44.903
MATT: "I do not see what you mean."

02:02:44.903 --> 02:02:48.647
LAURA: What's the stuff that swirled around when
you put it on the table?

02:02:48.647 --> 02:02:53.131
MATT: He taps it again and (energy crackling). It
looks like a spark.

02:02:53.131 --> 02:02:54.388
LAURA: What is that?

02:02:54.388 --> 02:02:58.435
MATT: "I don't know. But I bet it's interesting."

02:02:58.435 --> 02:03:02.983
TALIESIN: If we knew the name of everything we put
down our gullet, there would be no fun, ever, any

02:03:02.983 --> 02:03:04.119
time. I'm very excited.

02:03:04.119 --> 02:03:06.759
SAM: It's riboflavin.

02:03:06.759 --> 02:03:08.699
LAURA: What else?

02:03:08.699 --> 02:03:17.038
MATT: "I will trade these and put a topper of 50
gold pieces."

02:03:17.038 --> 02:03:22.750
TALIESIN: I'm all right with this.

02:03:22.750 --> 02:03:25.175
LAURA: I think that sounds like a pretty cool
deal.

02:03:25.175 --> 02:03:26.450
TALIESIN: I'm into it, yeah.

02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:29.661
MARISHA: I'll throw in for it. I'll throw in 25
gold.

02:03:29.661 --> 02:03:34.099
LAURA: Wait, no. Beau, no. He's paying us.

02:03:34.099 --> 02:03:35.528
MARISHA: Oh, I mean--

02:03:35.528 --> 02:03:37.914
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:03:37.914 --> 02:03:39.380
MARISHA: I'm pulling a Grog.

02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:41.060
MATT: You're totally pulling a Grog!

02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:47.854
MARISHA: I thought you said it was going to cost
an extra 50 on top. I'm sorry. Yeah, give us that

02:03:47.854 --> 02:03:49.065
money.

02:03:49.065 --> 02:03:51.855
MATT: "All right. If you don't mind--"

02:03:51.855 --> 02:03:53.833
MARISHA: Deal!

02:03:53.833 --> 02:03:58.844
MATT: He grabs the leather and carefully moves it
off the table and puts it in a small chest, closes

02:03:58.844 --> 02:04:05.450
it. Goes and counts out 50 gold pieces, shoves it
your way and goes, "Thank you for your patronage."

02:04:05.450 --> 02:04:09.305
TALIESIN: So if we were to take that 50 and
possibly spend it on something in this shop, is

02:04:09.305 --> 02:04:11.042
there anything that we should take a look at?

02:04:11.042 --> 02:04:15.717
MATT: "Depends on what you're looking for. I have
various balms and salves to help with headaches,

02:04:15.717 --> 02:04:22.076
"wounds that are festering. Some that help with
helping your manhood come to light, some that help

02:04:22.076 --> 02:04:24.460
"you with sleeping if you're having insomnia--"

02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.018
MARISHA: What's the manhood thing?

02:04:26.018 --> 02:04:27.519
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh, boy.

02:04:27.519 --> 02:04:32.123
LAURA: They help you-- sometimes guys have
problems with the (tongue click) and then there's

02:04:32.123 --> 02:04:34.122
potions that can help with that.

02:04:34.122 --> 02:04:35.422
MARISHA: Ah.

02:04:35.422 --> 02:04:37.651
LAURA: My mom said.

02:04:37.651 --> 02:04:42.551
TALIESIN: I'm curious about the sleeping thing you
have, and again, anything you're particularly

02:04:42.551 --> 02:04:43.671
proud of.

02:04:43.671 --> 02:04:45.174
LAURA: I'm going to look around the store.

02:04:45.174 --> 02:04:48.638
TALIESIN: I'm always excited for a surprise.

02:04:48.638 --> 02:04:55.152
MATT: Essentially, over about five minutes of him
showing you around, they're mostly general herbal

02:04:55.152 --> 02:05:00.034
remedies for day to day ailing elements. It looks
like all the special stuff that he had at his

02:05:00.034 --> 02:05:06.106
disposal went into those potions. Everything else
has been general helping, like melatonin. Things

02:05:06.106 --> 02:05:08.071
that help you a little bit.

02:05:08.071 --> 02:05:11.808
TALIESIN: I'll take some sleep aids and whatever
helps you sleep. Some sleepy tea or whatever.

02:05:11.808 --> 02:05:12.846
Anything like that.

02:05:12.846 --> 02:05:16.092
MATT: "All right. That's five silver for ten
doses."

02:05:16.092 --> 02:05:18.761
SAM: (whispering) Get the manhood thing.

02:05:18.761 --> 02:05:24.911
TALIESIN: You buy your own issue. Whatever you've
got a problem with, you can buy it yourself. This

02:05:24.911 --> 02:05:29.551
is not where my coin is going. And anything that
smells nice, just whatever.

02:05:29.551 --> 02:05:35.246
MATT: "There are some lavender oils I would
recommend to you. Here it is. I hope you like it.

02:05:35.246 --> 02:05:39.253
"It's quite nice." He rubs some on his wrist.
"Yes."

02:05:39.253 --> 02:05:40.948
TALIESIN: How much for the whole deal?

02:05:40.948 --> 02:05:50.112
MATT: "For the oils and your sleeping, I'll put it
around-- I'll say seven silver pieces."

02:05:50.112 --> 02:05:53.125
TALIESIN: Can you do change? One gold?

02:05:53.125 --> 02:05:55.658
MATT: "I can." He gives you three silver back.

02:05:55.658 --> 02:05:56.620
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:05:56.620 --> 02:06:01.252
(whispering and giggling)

02:06:01.252 --> 02:06:03.532
MARISHA: We're having our own story over here.

02:06:03.532 --> 02:06:06.350
TALIESIN: I'm aware. I'm ignoring it.

02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:10.742
MATT: You guys finish up there.

02:06:10.742 --> 02:06:14.062
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I'm going to put it in my
additional notes right now.

02:06:14.062 --> 02:06:16.632
MATT: Okay. You guys are heading off to the edge
of the swamp with Kiri.

02:06:16.632 --> 02:06:22.090
LIAM: This is so silly. I'm looking for a good
stone.

02:06:22.090 --> 02:06:26.405
SAM: What kind of a stone? A big stone? A skipping
stone?

02:06:26.405 --> 02:06:28.531
LIAM: No. Something with a little bit of heft to
it.

02:06:28.531 --> 02:06:30.565
SAM: Do you need it for a spell?

02:06:30.565 --> 02:06:37.140
LIAM: Not exactly. I don't really have anything
specific. I guess I'll know it when I see it.

02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:43.891
Something about yea big. You know, my father used
to tell me that if a stone had a ring around it

02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:45.348
all the way, it was lucky.

02:06:45.348 --> 02:06:47.709
SAM: If a stone had a ring around it?

02:06:47.709 --> 02:06:51.835
LIAM: Yeah, like a natural formation, a
coloration, right? It doesn't matter, though. I

02:06:51.835 --> 02:06:54.051
start looking for a stone.

02:06:54.051 --> 02:06:56.394
SAM: Kiri, help us look for a stone.

02:06:56.394 --> 02:06:57.767
LIAM: A good one.

02:06:57.767 --> 02:06:59.448
SAM: I'll look with him.

02:06:59.448 --> 02:07:03.656
MATT: (chirping) Make an investigation check, one
of you with advantage, if you're aiding the other.

02:07:03.656 --> 02:07:07.085
LIAM: I will make the check with your help, if
that's okay.

02:07:07.085 --> 02:07:08.360
MATT: Sure.

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:14.044
LIAM: Okay. That is a 13.

02:07:14.044 --> 02:07:15.767
MARISHA: With advantage.

02:07:15.767 --> 02:07:19.614
LIAM: Oh. That is a 14.

02:07:19.614 --> 02:07:22.245
MATT: All right. What particularly are you looking
for?

02:07:22.245 --> 02:07:28.054
LIAM: A stone about as large as a malformed
baseball, I suppose.

02:07:28.054 --> 02:07:33.444
MATT: Okay. It takes you upwards of ten minutes,
not very long, until you find one that's roughly

02:07:33.444 --> 02:07:38.202
that size. It's not perfectly spherical. It's got
its imperfections, but it's pretty smooth.

02:07:38.202 --> 02:07:39.661
LIAM: Is there a ring around it?

02:07:39.661 --> 02:07:42.367
MATT: I'll say there's a very faint ring around
it, sure.

02:07:42.367 --> 02:07:43.863
LIAM: That's a lucky rock.

02:07:43.863 --> 02:07:46.853
SAM: What will you use it for?

02:07:46.853 --> 02:07:51.582
LIAM: I'm not sure, exactly. I have some ideas.

02:07:51.582 --> 02:07:55.371
MARISHA: Murdering people in their sleep.

02:07:55.371 --> 02:08:05.826
SAM: You know, Caleb, I never told you this
before, but when we met that dragon lady-- Carrie?

02:08:05.826 --> 02:08:08.025
Kaylie? Kali?

02:08:08.025 --> 02:08:09.069
LIAM: Cali.

02:08:09.069 --> 02:08:18.570
SAM: Cali? That's a lot of K's. She gave me this
scroll of Invisibility. I've been hanging onto it,

02:08:18.570 --> 02:08:23.811
but I didn't know if you wanted to look at it and
maybe learn from it, or something?

02:08:23.811 --> 02:08:29.311
LIAM: I mean, does an armored bear shit in the
woods? Oh yeah, I want to see it! Let me see it.

02:08:29.311 --> 02:08:32.205
SAM: Here, here, yes. I didn't want the others to
see it, just in case.

02:08:32.205 --> 02:08:40.933
LIAM: Ooh, that's a good one. Ja.

02:08:40.933 --> 02:08:43.708
SAM: Do you want it? Can you learn that now?

02:08:43.708 --> 02:08:49.064
LIAM: I mean, I could use it right now, but that
seems detrimental. If I had proper funding and

02:08:49.064 --> 02:08:59.840
materials, but maybe later. I'm going to keep it
safe, for the moment.

02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:07.932
SAM: Great. Also, I'm so sorry that I got you in
trouble with Beau for the whole bowl incident. I

02:09:07.932 --> 02:09:12.407
didn't realize that she was going to freak out on
you like that.

02:09:12.407 --> 02:09:19.935
LIAM: Neither did I, but we're figuring it out.

02:09:19.935 --> 02:09:23.767
SAM: You took a walk with her. Was that okay? Was
it awkward?

02:09:23.767 --> 02:09:33.174
LIAM: Ja, that was fine. She's probably a good
egg.

02:09:33.174 --> 02:09:41.811
SAM: I think so, too. In her weird, sort of stoic
way, she seems to care about you.

02:09:41.811 --> 02:09:47.314
LIAM: Yeah, she's a prickly pear, but she's not a
bad person.

02:09:47.314 --> 02:09:54.629
SAM: Do you think she was dropped on her head or
something? She's very sort of, you know--

02:09:54.629 --> 02:10:00.689
(grunting). You know what I mean? (grunting)

02:10:00.689 --> 02:10:06.896
LIAM: I think you and I are a little "Eh," in our
own particular way.

02:10:06.896 --> 02:10:08.474
SAM: Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

02:10:08.474 --> 02:10:15.784
LIAM: I mean, she's abrasive, but that has its
uses. Right tool for the right job. Right Kiri?

02:10:15.784 --> 02:10:17.636
MATT: (as Jester) "Go fuck yourself!"

02:10:17.691 --> 02:10:20.215
(laughter)

02:10:20.215 --> 02:10:23.019
LIAM: Kiri knows what I'm talking about.

02:10:23.019 --> 02:10:25.252
MATT: (chirping)

02:10:25.252 --> 02:10:30.213
LIAM: You're good? You're still good?

02:10:30.213 --> 02:10:32.642
SAM: I'm very good. Yes.

02:10:32.642 --> 02:10:34.841
LIAM: Things are looking up, I think.

02:10:34.841 --> 02:10:41.146
SAM: Things are looking up and, you know, earlier
you said that I could come talk to you whenever I

02:10:41.146 --> 02:10:59.135
want, and thank you for that. That makes me feel
very good. Yeza was his name. The halfling man.

02:10:59.135 --> 02:11:06.795
Before. That's all. I just wanted to say his name
out loud. It's been a while.

02:11:06.795 --> 02:11:12.116
LIAM: That's a good name. Names are important.

02:11:12.116 --> 02:11:16.351
SAM: Yeah. But you got your rock!

02:11:16.351 --> 02:11:17.868
LIAM: Got my rock.

02:11:17.868 --> 02:11:19.880
SAM: All right. Let's rock out.

02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:23.681
LIAM: Kiri, come on.

02:11:23.681 --> 02:11:31.850
LAURA: Before we leave, or as we're leaving the
store, I want to say: Molly, stay inside for a

02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:38.316
little bit, okay? And keep talking to the guy,
okay? For just a minute.

02:11:38.316 --> 02:11:39.938
TALIESIN: All right.

02:11:39.938 --> 02:11:44.248
LAURA: I'm going to use my paint, and I'm going to
change the sign to "The Fungal Fart."

02:11:44.248 --> 02:11:47.555
(laughter)

02:11:47.555 --> 02:11:53.604
MATT: All righty. Make a sleight of hand check, if
you don't mind. I'll give you advantage if you

02:11:53.604 --> 02:11:56.447
manage to succeed on a deception check.

02:11:56.447 --> 02:11:59.092
TALIESIN: All right. What are you going to do with
that heart anyway?

02:11:59.092 --> 02:12:02.798
MATT: "Well, I have many possible uses. I could
extract all sorts of--"

02:12:02.798 --> 02:12:04.355
TALIESIN: That's a seven.

02:12:04.355 --> 02:12:05.804
MATT: So just make a roll.

02:12:05.804 --> 02:12:11.729
LAURA: Ooh. 20!

02:12:11.729 --> 02:12:20.741
MATT: With a quick flourish, you complete a fairly
accurate recreation of the font utilized, in its

02:12:20.741 --> 02:12:30.459
glorious Papyrus, without him noticing from behind
the door. With that, you go and complete your

02:12:30.459 --> 02:12:39.774
conversation. The rest of you meet up just as you
hear the clomping of horse hooves. All of you

02:12:39.774 --> 02:12:44.119
gather in the center of the Puddles. The clomping
is this splashing as there's still two inches of

02:12:44.119 --> 02:12:47.773
water in this section of Berleben. (wet clomping)

02:12:47.773 --> 02:12:54.034
MARISHA: Ugh. I think I'm getting athlete's foot
from all the moisture in my shoes from this place.

02:12:54.034 --> 02:12:55.193
LAURA: I can heal that.

02:12:55.193 --> 02:12:56.468
MARISHA: Really? It's so itchy.

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:57.811
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's called "jungle rot."

02:12:57.811 --> 02:12:59.020
MARISHA: Ugh. Really?

02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:01.603
LAURA: Hey, you've got our stuff!

02:13:01.603 --> 02:13:04.322
TRAVIS: Whose stuff?

02:13:04.322 --> 02:13:07.530
TALIESIN: Is everything relatively all right on
the cart? Doesn't look like it's been--

02:13:07.530 --> 02:13:09.277
MATT: You guys take a moment to look through.
Everything's intact.

02:13:09.277 --> 02:13:10.894
ASHLEY: We had to kill them all, but we got it.

02:13:10.894 --> 02:13:13.631
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yasha was surprisingly effective.

02:13:13.631 --> 02:13:15.305
LAURA: That's not surprising.

02:13:15.305 --> 02:13:16.986
TALIESIN: I trust you. It's the only way to be
sure.

02:13:16.986 --> 02:13:21.107
MATT: Kiri comes up. (like Caleb) "She's probably
a good egg."

02:13:21.107 --> 02:13:23.194
MARISHA: What does that mean?

02:13:23.194 --> 02:13:32.910
SAM: She could've learned that from anyone. Anyone
with a mildly Zemnian accent.

02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:36.551
MATT: (like Nott) "Yeza was his name. The halfling
man. From before."

02:13:36.551 --> 02:13:41.646
(laughter)

02:13:41.646 --> 02:13:43.354
SAM: Shut up! Shut up, Kiri!

02:13:43.354 --> 02:13:45.087
MATT: (like Nott) "Shut up! Shut up, Kiri! Shut
up!"

02:13:45.087 --> 02:13:47.379
LAURA: Yeza?

02:13:47.379 --> 02:13:48.517
MATT: (like Nott) "Yeza."

02:13:48.517 --> 02:13:50.136
LAURA: Was he the halfling guy?

02:13:50.136 --> 02:13:52.680
TRAVIS: Did you say "Yeza," Kiri?

02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:57.214
MATT: (like Nott) "Yeza was his name. The halfling
man. From before."

02:13:57.214 --> 02:14:00.238
LIAM: The gimp we were joking about under the
floor of that place.

02:14:00.238 --> 02:14:02.489
LAURA: Aw.

02:14:02.489 --> 02:14:05.922
SAM: Aw what?! Don't look at-- I'm turning green!

02:14:05.922 --> 02:14:15.338
MATT: All right. You guys gather your things, get
back onto your cart and your horses, and head

02:14:15.338 --> 02:14:21.139
southward, exiting Berleben, leaving this swamp
town behind, hopefully for good. Making your way

02:14:21.139 --> 02:14:26.967
back onto the road. Which direction are you going?
You have a map.

02:14:26.967 --> 02:14:28.181
MARISHA: Where's the map?

02:14:28.181 --> 02:14:29.327
SAM: Northeast.

02:14:29.327 --> 02:14:31.284
TRAVIS: Northeast to Shadycreek Run.

02:14:31.284 --> 02:14:34.012
LAURA: While everyone's figuring it out--

02:14:34.012 --> 02:14:36.633
SAM: Wait, we have to go around Hupperdook.

02:14:36.633 --> 02:14:38.254
LAURA: Hupperdook!

02:14:38.254 --> 02:14:40.734
MATT: You guys heading to Hupperdook on the way?

02:14:40.734 --> 02:14:43.291
MARISHA: Or we can go through Hupperdook.

02:14:43.291 --> 02:14:46.624
SAM: There's a ridge line there, right? There's
mountains?

02:14:46.624 --> 02:14:48.245
MATT: Those are high mountains.

02:14:48.245 --> 02:14:50.280
SAM: Silberquel Ridge?

02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:53.200
MATT: The Silberquel Ridge is a very high series
of mountains.

02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.767
SAM: We would have to have to go around it--

02:14:55.767 --> 02:14:57.799
LAURA: So we'd pass by Hupperdook.

02:14:57.799 --> 02:15:04.136
MATT: There are roads, or there is cutting through
the open fields and nature. That's your choice to

02:15:04.136 --> 02:15:06.123
make. Looking at the map here.

02:15:06.123 --> 02:15:08.880
TALIESIN: We have some weights to put down.

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:16.624
SAM: So we have to go around these mountains. We
can either go to the east past Hupperdook. Because

02:15:16.624 --> 02:15:18.737
we're going to Nogvurot, right, up there?

02:15:18.737 --> 02:15:22.630
MATT: You guys are heading this direction. As far
as you know, Shadycreek, which is over here in the

02:15:22.630 --> 02:15:23.587
corner--

02:15:23.587 --> 02:15:24.715
SAM and LIAM: Shittycreek.

02:15:24.715 --> 02:15:27.945
TALIESIN: But there seems to be the crossroads up
there. There seems to be a path through the

02:15:27.945 --> 02:15:28.968
forest--

02:15:28.968 --> 02:15:32.692
SAM: We could go around Hupperdook way, or we
could go Rexxentrum way.

02:15:32.692 --> 02:15:35.226
TALIESIN: I think we go Rexxentrum, just because
there's an army marching that direction.

02:15:35.226 --> 02:15:37.883
LAURA: But Rexxentrum is the capital.

02:15:37.883 --> 02:15:40.393
LIAM: That place is very busy.

02:15:40.393 --> 02:15:43.247
LAURA: We should probably stay clear and go to
Hupperdook.

02:15:43.247 --> 02:15:45.411
SAM: You've been up there, haven't you, Caleb?

02:15:45.411 --> 02:15:48.699
LIAM: Yeah, but there's a war brewing, and that
place is the center of it all.

02:15:48.699 --> 02:15:50.296
SAM: But you might know some folks who could help
us.

02:15:50.296 --> 02:15:52.973
ASHLEY: That man Trent Ikithon or whatever is in
Rexxentrum.

02:15:52.973 --> 02:15:54.732
LAURA: That Trent guy?

02:15:54.732 --> 02:15:55.851
ASHLEY: Yeah, that Trent guy.

02:15:55.851 --> 02:15:58.430
MARISHA: Wait, is in where? Rexxentrum?

02:15:58.430 --> 02:16:05.781
ASHLEY: Yeah, don't you remember? When we talked
to him he said if we wanted to meet up with him to

02:16:05.781 --> 02:16:07.524
talk more, he was in Rexxentrum.

02:16:07.524 --> 02:16:10.679
LIAM: I thought we were on a timetable to get
these things done for the Gentleman.

02:16:10.679 --> 02:16:12.804
TRAVIS: And we're trying to be sly. We want to
avoid eyes.

02:16:12.804 --> 02:16:16.778
LAURA: Tell you what, we'll go Hupperdook on the way
up, and then we can do Rexxentrum on the way back.

02:16:16.778 --> 02:16:22.711
MARISHA: I'm just going to say, I've heard some
pretty crazy stories through the grapevine about

02:16:22.711 --> 02:16:24.924
what goes on in Hupperdook.

02:16:24.924 --> 02:16:27.832
SAM: What goes on in Hupperdook?

02:16:27.832 --> 02:16:30.925
TALIESIN: I don't believe you've ever heard a
crazy story about anything happening anywhere.

02:16:30.925 --> 02:16:34.502
MARISHA: Are you challenging me?

02:16:34.502 --> 02:16:36.077
TALIESIN: I'm challenging you for details.

02:16:36.077 --> 02:16:46.458
MARISHA: So, all right. City's got a lot of
gnomes, and they're filled with industry, and they

02:16:46.458 --> 02:16:49.648
work all the time. But at night, they party.

02:16:49.648 --> 02:16:51.259
LAURA: Gnome parties.

02:16:51.259 --> 02:16:54.474
MARISHA: Work hard, party hard. It's what that
city's all about.

02:16:54.474 --> 02:16:57.395
LAURA: And they live in mushroom houses.

02:16:57.395 --> 02:17:02.060
MARISHA: I don't know about the mushroom houses
thing, but I've heard some crazy-- they have

02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:03.234
ragers every night.

02:17:03.234 --> 02:17:05.202
ASHLEY: I've heard gnome parties are the craziest
kind.

02:17:05.202 --> 02:17:06.443
SAM: Are you making this up?

02:17:06.443 --> 02:17:07.646
MARISHA: No. Not at all.

02:17:07.646 --> 02:17:08.841
LAURA: Insight check!

02:17:08.841 --> 02:17:11.181
MATT: Make an insight check, both of you.

02:17:11.181 --> 02:17:14.636
SAM: 18.

02:17:14.636 --> 02:17:15.701
LAURA: 13.

02:17:15.701 --> 02:17:19.699
MATT: As far as she's aware, she's telling the
truth.

02:17:19.699 --> 02:17:22.138
LAURA: That's amazing.

02:17:22.138 --> 02:17:25.105
MARISHA: I'm just saying, I've had some shady
friends.

02:17:25.105 --> 02:17:28.350
LIAM: Ain't no party like a Hupperdook party.

02:17:28.350 --> 02:17:30.950
MARISHA: I've had some shady friends.

02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:33.116
TRAVIS: Hupperdook it is.

02:17:33.116 --> 02:17:34.240
SAM: Let's "dook" it up.

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:41.770
MARISHA: I think they have one of the highest
imports and exports for illicit substances. I

02:17:41.770 --> 02:17:43.091
don't know. That's just what I've heard.

02:17:43.091 --> 02:17:45.205
SAM: Okay, let's go.

02:17:45.205 --> 02:17:46.427
TRAVIS: Let's get it started.

02:17:46.427 --> 02:17:54.097
MATT: You guys are making your way along the
Rillway Road eastward from Berleben, heading from

02:17:54.097 --> 02:18:02.607
here along Rillway. Heading past north of
Felderwin, hitting the Felderwin Tillage, and then

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:05.206
there's a crossroads that leads to the northern
Gravelway Path.

02:18:05.206 --> 02:18:06.416
SAM: We're going that far--

02:18:06.416 --> 02:18:10.332
MATT: If you're following the roads. If you guys
are cutting away from the roads and going through

02:18:10.332 --> 02:18:13.919
the rough open fields, that can be done.

02:18:13.919 --> 02:18:19.516
LAURA: We have a carriage, let's stay on the
roads.

02:18:19.516 --> 02:18:26.081
MATT: Via road, it's about 110 miles to the
crosswo-- crossroads, and then 120 miles along the

02:18:26.081 --> 02:18:27.272
Gravelway Path.

02:18:27.272 --> 02:18:29.156
MARISHA: To hewe? To the cwosswoads?

02:18:29.156 --> 02:18:31.857
MATT: It's about a week's worth of travel to get
to Hupperdook from where you are.

02:18:31.857 --> 02:18:33.916
MARISHA: What's in the cwosswoads?

02:18:33.916 --> 02:18:37.019
MATT: You'll find out when you get there. You
haven't traveled there before.

02:18:37.019 --> 02:18:38.717
MARISHA: Is it a village? We don't know.

02:18:38.717 --> 02:18:40.290
SAM: I've been there, haven't I?

02:18:40.290 --> 02:18:45.957
MATT: You may have been there, actually. The
crossroads, from what your experience is, folks

02:18:45.957 --> 02:18:51.590
who are making long travels stop there and might set up
shop for a day or two to sell or trade whatever

02:18:51.590 --> 02:18:55.609
wares they have before they continue on the rest
of their journey. And people from Felderwin and

02:18:55.609 --> 02:19:01.244
the Felderwin Tillage head up there sometimes to
set up shop if there are people that are traveling through.

02:19:01.244 --> 02:19:02.359
LAURA: Like a flea market town.

02:19:02.359 --> 02:19:09.212
MATT: Kind of. It's less a town, it's maybe a
handful of anywhere from four to 20 tents

02:19:09.212 --> 02:19:10.467
depending on what time of year it is.

02:19:10.467 --> 02:19:13.180
LAURA: It's an outlet, outside of town.

02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:15.020
MATT: It's a fantasy outlet.

02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:16.097
SAM: Cabazon!

02:19:16.097 --> 02:19:18.337
MARISHA: Yes!

02:19:18.337 --> 02:19:22.725
LAURA: I bet I can get 300 gold worth of diamonds
for way less.

02:19:22.725 --> 02:19:28.059
SAM: We need that! And our money exchange.

02:19:28.059 --> 02:19:36.659
LAURA: Which, by the way, I want to talk to you
guys. Here's the thing; this spell that I have

02:19:36.659 --> 02:19:45.414
takes diamonds, in order to bring you back to
life. I don't have enough gold to buy all these

02:19:45.414 --> 02:19:47.926
diamonds for everybody, so--

02:19:47.926 --> 02:19:53.397
LIAM: So you're asking if we would like to pool
our resources for a handful of these diamonds for

02:19:53.397 --> 02:19:55.328
a perilous situation?

02:19:55.328 --> 02:19:58.697
LAURA: Well, yeah. Or if you want to be selfish
about it, you can buy your own diamonds and then

02:19:58.697 --> 02:20:00.471
I'll use those for you.

02:20:00.471 --> 02:20:03.203
TRAVIS: How big do these diamonds have to be, like
little suckers?

02:20:03.203 --> 02:20:07.501
LAURA: Doesn't matter, it's just 300 gold worth of
diamonds, but they're going to be gone if you die.

02:20:07.501 --> 02:20:09.213
TRAVIS: That's a significant diamond.

02:20:09.213 --> 02:20:11.425
MARISHA: How do you know which diamonds are our
diamonds?

02:20:11.425 --> 02:20:13.092
LAURA: You keep your diamonds on you.

02:20:13.092 --> 02:20:17.886
MARISHA: But don't you need them for the spell? Do
we have a specific diamond pocket that, if we go

02:20:17.886 --> 02:20:20.118
down, you go in our diamond pocket?

02:20:20.118 --> 02:20:21.227
LAURA: Yeah!

02:20:21.227 --> 02:20:22.592
SAM: She's got to hold all the diamonds.

02:20:22.592 --> 02:20:26.631
LAURA: No! You have your own diamond pocket and
then when I save you, it'll be like--

02:20:26.631 --> 02:20:30.620
SAM: We're each going to have a pocket of 300
gold--

02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:37.840
LIAM: I would rather you, as an accomplished
healer, knew where the diamonds were on your

02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:42.440
person and got them lickety-split rather than you
looking through my 32 pockets to find the

02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:43.648
diamonds.

02:20:43.648 --> 02:20:44.886
LAURA: Sounds good to me.

02:20:44.886 --> 02:20:49.701
LIAM: But yeah, I agree with you that we should
pool our resources, that is a good idea.

02:20:49.701 --> 02:20:53.974
MARISHA: And whenever we steal jewelry off of
people, maybe we keep it instead of selling it.

02:20:53.974 --> 02:20:59.385
LAURA: We just pop out the diamonds! We can still
keep ruby jewelry and emerald jewelry--

02:20:59.385 --> 02:21:00.995
SAM: I will look for diamonds.

02:21:00.995 --> 02:21:03.511
ASHLEY: That's all you need is diamonds?

02:21:03.511 --> 02:21:04.910
LAURA: Just diamonds.

02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:09.262
MARISHA: Do you have any spells that use rubies or
emeralds? What about you, Caleb?

02:21:09.262 --> 02:21:14.550
LIAM: This is a little diamond I use for that one
thing I do.

02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:16.173
MARISHA: But this doesn't go away?

02:21:16.173 --> 02:21:23.933
LIAM: No, this one I spin it and surround it with
arcane energy, and no, it does not go away.

02:21:23.933 --> 02:21:27.748
LAURA: What's that about? How come he gets to keep
his?

02:21:27.748 --> 02:21:30.920
SAM: Are you talking to the Traveler right now?

02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:34.194
LIAM: It's a very studied practice; I spent years
learning how to do it.

02:21:34.194 --> 02:21:35.503
SAM: He's extremely smart.

02:21:35.503 --> 02:21:37.121
TALIESIN: What's the Traveler doing up there?

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:42.626
LAURA: Well, maybe he can fly, I don't know!
Sometimes he's invisible, could it be he's flying

02:21:42.626 --> 02:21:44.407
next to me? I don't know!

02:21:44.407 --> 02:21:46.151
LIAM: Could you let her keep the diamonds?

02:21:46.151 --> 02:21:48.024
LAURA: Could we maybe keep the diamonds?

02:21:48.024 --> 02:21:50.048
MARISHA: Could you teach her how to do the spinny
thing?

02:21:50.048 --> 02:21:52.185
TALIESIN: Could someone keep their eyes on the
road as we're moving forward?

02:21:52.185 --> 02:21:53.421
SAM: Let's go!

02:21:53.421 --> 02:22:00.770
MARISHA: The Traveler is my co-pilot, it's okay.
He's leading the way.

02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:02.331
LIAM: Traveler take the wheel.

02:22:02.331 --> 02:22:05.145
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (singing) Traveler take the
wheel!

02:22:05.145 --> 02:22:06.721
MATT: Oh my god, guys.

02:22:06.721 --> 02:22:16.430
LAURA: While we're going, I need to sit next to
Kiri, and I'm going to pull out my sketchbook, and

02:22:16.430 --> 02:22:21.435
I'm going to ask her to write down everything she
can think of about her mom and dad, and draw a

02:22:21.435 --> 02:22:25.157
little picture of them, because I'm going to try
to do Sending for her mom and dad.

02:22:25.157 --> 02:22:31.877
MATT: Okay. She draws the best she can. Her
drawings are rudimentary, but functional. You see

02:22:31.877 --> 02:22:36.529
two blackbird parents in somewhat geometric
clothing.

02:22:36.529 --> 02:22:39.237
LAURA: That's about how I pictured them.

02:22:39.237 --> 02:22:42.192
MARISHA: It's American Gothic, but as birds.

02:22:42.192 --> 02:22:48.796
MATT: Basically. Best you can tell from what she
writes down and communicates with you via the

02:22:48.852 --> 02:22:54.632
book, they were traveling from the east, heading
west.

02:22:54.632 --> 02:22:58.196
LAURA: So they were going the opposite direction
that we are.

02:22:58.196 --> 02:22:59.239
MATT: They are, yeah.

02:22:59.239 --> 02:23:00.530
LAURA: That sucks.

02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:08.805
MATT: You guys make your way out of Labenda Swamp,
heading southward across the bridge past the river

02:23:08.805 --> 02:23:11.590
that breaks from the Ounterloch heading south.

02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:21.443
LIAM: Just a minor thing. While we're traveling,
I'm going to use my minor alchemy to turn a ring

02:23:21.443 --> 02:23:27.019
of the wood in the cart-- I'm sitting criss-cross
applesauce-- and I make a ring of copper in the

02:23:27.019 --> 02:23:33.965
bottom of the wagon and place this stone in it. I
place both hands on the side of the stone and I'm

02:23:33.965 --> 02:23:40.300
trying to channel my knowledge and ability into
it. I'm futzing with it, that's it.

02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:48.338
LAURA: I take a little paintbrush and I draw a
smiley face on the rock.

02:23:48.338 --> 02:23:49.903
LIAM: I slap her hand.

02:23:49.903 --> 02:23:58.024
MATT: Because this is a longer journey, I'm not
going to drag us through every single stage of it.

02:23:58.024 --> 02:24:00.202
But there are some elements that can happen during
this journey.

02:24:00.202 --> 02:24:02.458
TALIESIN: You have died of dysentery.

02:24:02.458 --> 02:24:03.883
MATT: Yes, exactly.

02:24:03.883 --> 02:24:10.988
MARISHA: Did we ever find anything out about the
Sending thing? How did that go? That's what I want to

02:24:10.988 --> 02:24:12.226
know about first.

02:24:12.288 --> 02:24:16.968
MATT: Unfortunately, given the lack of details,
lack of information--

02:24:16.968 --> 02:24:21.434
SAM: The fact that they can't speak.

02:24:21.434 --> 02:24:26.057
TALIESIN: At some point, we want to pull out the
map and show it to Kiri and see if she can point

02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:27.595
to anything on the map.

02:24:27.595 --> 02:24:30.401
LAURA: They're not dead!

02:24:30.401 --> 02:24:35.446
TRAVIS: We're going to get this fucking bird
killed, y'all. I'm just saying.

02:24:35.446 --> 02:24:36.802
MARISHA: This bird's going to die.

02:24:36.802 --> 02:24:43.475
MATT: The Sending spell isn't able to connect with
anybody, unfortunately, but you tried. First day

02:24:43.475 --> 02:24:50.403
of travel comes to a close; you reach the river.
Actually, you don't quite reach the river, you

02:24:50.403 --> 02:24:59.446
almost do. First night's rest happens. For
expediency, who wants to make the perception check

02:24:59.446 --> 02:25:01.587
for the evening's rest?

02:25:01.587 --> 02:25:02.399
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

02:25:02.399 --> 02:25:03.629
LIAM: I will also do it.

02:25:03.629 --> 02:25:04.964
MATT: Both individually?

02:25:04.964 --> 02:25:08.406
LIAM: I will do it individually.

02:25:08.406 --> 02:25:09.693
MATT: Both of you guys roll.

02:25:09.693 --> 02:25:11.411
LAURA: I like how this is like Final Fantasy
traveling.

02:25:11.411 --> 02:25:15.331
TRAVIS: 16.

02:25:15.331 --> 02:25:17.182
LIAM: Ooh, I got a five.

02:25:17.182 --> 02:25:24.421
MATT: That's better. For the evening's rest--
taking your breaks, keeping watch throughout the

02:25:24.421 --> 02:25:32.560
night-- no incident. At one moment, there is a
shifting of movement in the distance. Fjord, you

02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:37.243
go and check, and there is a family of foxes that
are making their way through the field southward

02:25:37.243 --> 02:25:41.842
away as it gets colder. They're starting to move
southward, and you spook them off to get away from

02:25:41.842 --> 02:25:42.677
the traps.

02:25:42.677 --> 02:25:43.657
TRAVIS: Scat!

02:25:43.657 --> 02:25:47.740
MATT: The next morning, you guys get yourselves
back up into the cart and continue on further. You

02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:53.906
pass beyond the river and start making your way
towards the crossroads before your second day

02:25:53.906 --> 02:26:00.934
comes to completion. Who's going to keep watch the
next evening? All right, make the roll, guys.

02:26:00.934 --> 02:26:02.377
TALIESIN: Do you want advantage?

02:26:02.377 --> 02:26:03.739
LAURA: Let's roll individual ones.

02:26:03.739 --> 02:26:08.729
TALIESIN: Individually. 20.

02:26:08.729 --> 02:26:10.197
LAURA: Oh, 17.

02:26:10.197 --> 02:26:18.637
MATT: Keeping watch throughout the evening,
thankfully, no issues happen. You manage to keep

02:26:18.637 --> 02:26:23.385
watch, evening goes without issue. Your rest is
fine, and you continue onto your third day of

02:26:23.385 --> 02:26:32.934
travel. Along the way, you do finally reach the
crossroads here. As you come upon the area, you

02:26:32.934 --> 02:26:38.369
see where the road diverges. It continues in a
southward curve and then a road that very starkly

02:26:38.369 --> 02:26:44.530
turns left and heads in a northeastern direction.
There are a series of wooden signs up, and you do

02:26:44.530 --> 02:26:52.068
see three tents of varying sizes. There is a blue
and white striped tent, a white tent, and a faded

02:26:52.068 --> 02:26:58.755
green one. A couple of carts are stopped off to
the side, and some folks are looking in there. It

02:26:58.755 --> 02:27:05.301
looks like a very small merchant setup there, but
if you were to inquire, you could see what's

02:27:05.301 --> 02:27:06.352
available.

02:27:06.352 --> 02:27:15.516
LIAM: Wait a second. I send Frumpkin skittering
off in that direction. As he's leaving, I say,

02:27:15.516 --> 02:27:19.626
"Rub against some ankles. And listen."

02:27:19.626 --> 02:27:21.196
MARISHA: Who are you talking to? Are you talking
to me?

02:27:21.196 --> 02:27:23.916
SAM: I think he's talking to the cat.

02:27:23.916 --> 02:27:25.113
MARISHA: Okay.

02:27:25.113 --> 02:27:26.221
LAURA: That would be funny.

02:27:26.221 --> 02:27:29.400
MARISHA: That would be weird if I walked up to you
and said, "Did you want me to rub his ankles?"

02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:32.396
SAM: No, sometimes when he stares at you and
doesn't say anything, he is talking to you,

02:27:32.396 --> 02:27:34.160
though. So that's a fair question.

02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:35.357
MARISHA: No, I've noticed that.

02:27:35.357 --> 02:27:38.003
TALIESIN: Have you ever actually tried rubbing his
ankles when he says that?

02:27:38.003 --> 02:27:41.271
MARISHA: Can he still hear us, or can he only hear
the cat?

02:27:41.271 --> 02:27:43.555
SAM: He only can hear the cat, but he can feel
you, so poke him if you feel--

02:27:43.555 --> 02:27:45.956
MARISHA: Okay. What if I poke his ankles?

02:27:45.956 --> 02:27:47.611
SAM: That would be weird.

02:27:47.611 --> 02:27:53.382
MATT: Frumpkin listens about, and there are folks
asking and trying to haggle prices. You get the

02:27:53.382 --> 02:28:00.251
sense that one of them, as Frumpkin looks up, has
a small selection of fruits, some looking more

02:28:00.251 --> 02:28:08.015
tropical, probably further south-sourced, brighter
oranges and yellow in color, some with vibrant

02:28:08.015 --> 02:28:09.401
green leaves.

02:28:09.401 --> 02:28:12.467
LAURA: Pineapple!

02:28:12.467 --> 02:28:13.915
SAM: Durian!

02:28:13.915 --> 02:28:21.234
MATT: The white tent goes by, has more of a
general goods feel. There are tools, repair kits

02:28:21.234 --> 02:28:29.439
for travel. You see some bolts, two crossbows in
the back wall, all sorts of general tools. It

02:28:29.439 --> 02:28:36.789
looks to be a general store and some basic means
to defend oneself when on the road.

02:28:36.789 --> 02:28:38.022
LIAM: Any books?

02:28:38.022 --> 02:28:39.968
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:28:39.968 --> 02:28:43.967
LIAM: Any books, 13?

02:28:43.967 --> 02:28:50.945
MATT: No books. The green one appears to be mainly
furs and leathers, some that are tanning on the

02:28:50.945 --> 02:28:55.457
outside, as well as bone jewelry made of teeth and
bone of hunted animals.

02:28:55.457 --> 02:28:58.474
MARISHA: That's cool. You guys know tents.

02:28:58.474 --> 02:29:01.140
SAM: We also need some warm clothes. Winter's
coming.

02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:03.004
TALIESIN: Some tents would be a great idea.

02:29:03.004 --> 02:29:07.379
LIAM: To justify all of this, he's been muttering
everything he sees. Bones, bone necklaces,

02:29:07.379 --> 02:29:08.832
pineapples.

02:29:08.832 --> 02:29:11.763
MARISHA: I want a bone necklace, but do you guys
recognize any of these tent colors?

02:29:11.763 --> 02:29:16.692
SAM: I recognize the color green and white.

02:29:16.692 --> 02:29:21.709
TALIESIN: I generally don't actually care about
the theme of any city that I'm in because I've

02:29:21.709 --> 02:29:24.636
never bothered to learn. Does any of this look
familiar before? Do I recognize any of these

02:29:24.636 --> 02:29:25.812
people?

02:29:25.812 --> 02:29:32.416
MATT: If you start walking and glancing through?
No. They're all various travelers. No one has

02:29:32.416 --> 02:29:36.323
crossed your path before, nobody of significance
to your previous experience, no.

02:29:36.323 --> 02:29:38.972
MARISHA: I want some bone jewelry! I walk off that
way.

02:29:38.972 --> 02:29:43.013
TALIESIN: I think we're going to need some general
goods. I've got some ideas of some stuff we could

02:29:43.013 --> 02:29:44.358
use on the road.

02:29:44.358 --> 02:29:47.262
MARISHA: Yeah, you mentioned the tent thing.
That's not a bad idea.

02:29:47.262 --> 02:29:48.740
TALIESIN: We should have some tents.

02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:50.941
MATT: You head to the green tent, those who are
going, to the one that has the bone jewelry. There

02:29:50.941 --> 02:29:57.832
is a human woman there, dark, weathered skin,
leather and fur over her shoulders. She's

02:29:57.832 --> 02:30:05.963
currently talking with somebody, and as you
approach, "Terribly sorry. If you're looking for

02:30:05.963 --> 02:30:12.355
"furs, bones, or leathers, look around. Feel free
to ask. I will tell you what we are selling for."

02:30:12.355 --> 02:30:16.513
MARISHA: Do you have any bracelets? A goblin took
my jade one.

02:30:16.513 --> 02:30:20.382
MATT: "That's unfortunate, but we do." She turns
around and there's a few strips of leather that

02:30:20.382 --> 02:30:25.429
are rough on the edges but functional. One of them
has a fur inlay, so it feels comfortable on the

02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:29.183
wrist. "I've made these myself."

02:30:29.183 --> 02:30:33.807
MARISHA: Fjord, does this look like a little much?
This feels like it doesn't go with my outfit.

02:30:33.807 --> 02:30:35.900
TRAVIS: Are they thick or thin bones?

02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:37.275
MARISHA: Yeah, does it feel out of place?

02:30:37.275 --> 02:30:38.391
MATT: These are leather.

02:30:38.391 --> 02:30:39.623
MARISHA: Oh, it's just leather?

02:30:39.623 --> 02:30:42.105
MATT: The wristband that she has is leather, yeah.

02:30:42.105 --> 02:30:45.516
LAURA: If you got a thicker cloak, it would look
real good with it.

02:30:45.516 --> 02:30:47.353
MATT: Are you looking for bone in particular?

02:30:47.353 --> 02:30:48.557
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:30:48.557 --> 02:30:55.615
MATT: There is bone jewelry. There's a bone choker
that's a series of finger bones that are lined end

02:30:55.615 --> 02:31:00.929
to end that goes around the neck, there's one that
can go on the wrist, looks like there's a necklace

02:31:00.982 --> 02:31:06.880
that has a bunch of various canine teeth-- not
necessarily from a canine, but sharp teeth from

02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:08.238
some sort of creature.

02:31:08.238 --> 02:31:10.386
MARISHA: Where do these bones come from?

02:31:10.386 --> 02:31:16.475
MATT: "Oh, most of these were taken from various
wolves, dire in nature."

02:31:16.475 --> 02:31:18.028
MARISHA: Volves?

02:31:18.028 --> 02:31:19.323
MATT: "Wolves."

02:31:19.323 --> 02:31:21.422
MARISHA: Wolves, wolves.

02:31:21.422 --> 02:31:28.365
MATT: "These are from the Zemni Fields, near
Icehaven is where I hail. It's a very

02:31:28.365 --> 02:31:34.410
hunter-trapper community up there. I bring the
goods to sell this far south."

02:31:34.410 --> 02:31:35.984
TRAVIS: Very impressive.

02:31:35.984 --> 02:31:39.236
LIAM: Frumpkin comes around a corner and Caleb
sees that the entire party has left him in the

02:31:39.236 --> 02:31:44.770
cart, snaps out of it and scrabbles out, and
starts hustling over that way.

02:31:44.770 --> 02:31:52.196
LAURA: Do you buy stuff as well, or do you only
sell stuff?

02:31:52.196 --> 02:31:57.123
MATT: "Mainly meant only to sell, but if you have
something worth buying, do present, please. I'm

02:31:57.123 --> 02:31:58.291
"curious."

02:31:58.291 --> 02:32:02.926
LAURA: I've got a gator skin.

02:32:02.926 --> 02:32:14.140
MATT: She takes it. By the way, the gator skin is
not tanned. It's not cured. It is fucking nasty.

02:32:14.140 --> 02:32:24.163
As you pull it out of your haversack, it's
dripping with congealed blood. Flies immediately

02:32:24.163 --> 02:32:26.190
start gathering and she's like, "Ugh."

02:32:26.190 --> 02:32:27.260
LAURA: Super fresh!

02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:30.839
MATT: "I can tell. Not interested, sorry."

02:32:30.839 --> 02:32:41.834
LAURA: We should probably tan this. I leave the
tent.

02:32:41.834 --> 02:32:45.141
MARISHA: I buy the bone bracelet, throw her money,
and say: thanks! And walk off.

02:32:45.141 --> 02:32:46.771
MATT: Okay, you didn't ask how much it was.

02:32:46.771 --> 02:32:47.837
MARISHA: No.

02:32:47.837 --> 02:32:49.772
MATT: The bone bracelet runs you two gold. It's
not that expensive.

02:32:49.772 --> 02:32:51.063
MARISHA: Here.

02:32:51.063 --> 02:32:54.553
SAM: I disguise myself as a gnome, go in, and buy
warm clothes.

02:32:54.553 --> 02:33:02.907
MATT: Okay. For the set of warm clothes, which is
heavy leathers and fur that you can throw over, a

02:33:02.907 --> 02:33:07.311
leather cloak as well that you can bundle up in,
and it straps over and buckles multiple times

02:33:07.311 --> 02:33:12.524
across the way. For you, it runs past your legs,
almost, so you'd have to trim it up a bit, but

02:33:12.524 --> 02:33:15.460
that one will run you three gold pieces.

02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:17.229
SAM: Okay, done.

02:33:17.229 --> 02:33:19.298
TALIESIN: I want to hit the general store.

02:33:19.298 --> 02:33:25.069
MATT: As you approach the white tent, you see a
female halfling there who is wearing a leather

02:33:25.069 --> 02:33:29.841
apron that has some tools tucked in there. There's
nobody currently at the station, so as you

02:33:29.841 --> 02:33:36.132
approach, she looks out to you. She has frizzy
brown hair with some gray ones that are starting

02:33:36.132 --> 02:33:41.569
to sprout from the outside that's pulled back and
held in this giant poof of a ponytail. She looks

02:33:41.569 --> 02:33:45.189
out toward you and points and goes, "Oh, hello!
Looking to buy something?"

02:33:45.189 --> 02:33:49.688
TALIESIN: Actually, I am. How fascinating that you
caught me right in the moment where I'm ready to

02:33:49.688 --> 02:33:51.102
spend money.

02:33:51.102 --> 02:33:52.437
MATT: "Oh, great. What are you looking for?"

02:33:52.437 --> 02:33:53.732
TALIESIN: Well, I've got a couple problems.

02:33:53.732 --> 02:33:56.709
MATT: "Problems? I have, possibly, some
solutions."

02:33:56.709 --> 02:33:59.911
TALIESIN: I've got a cart that keeps breaking down
on me.

02:33:59.911 --> 02:34:01.168
MATT: "That's a problem."

02:34:01.168 --> 02:34:03.150
TALIESIN: If you've got a kit for something like
that. Also, I was thinking about maybe putting

02:34:03.150 --> 02:34:09.296
some canvas on top of it, giving it a little bit
of safety from the elements. I think I'm going to

02:34:09.296 --> 02:34:14.816
need at least four tents. I've recently come into
a bunch of new companions and they really didn't

02:34:14.816 --> 02:34:20.290
have what's necessary to make our way through
these wonderful, wonderful roads.

02:34:20.290 --> 02:34:27.442
MATT: "Tents, tents I can do. Two gold per tent.
We have five ready. If you need four, throwing

02:34:27.442 --> 02:34:31.170
those all together if you're buying a tent--"

02:34:31.170 --> 02:34:32.387
TALIESIN: Four'll do it.

02:34:32.387 --> 02:34:34.082
MARISHA: How big are they? Are they four-person
sleepers?

02:34:34.082 --> 02:34:35.418
MATT: They're two-person tents each.

02:34:35.418 --> 02:34:40.981
TALIESIN: Actually, I'll get five tents.

02:34:40.981 --> 02:34:45.547
MATT: "Five two-person tents. You're buying me
out. That's ten gold, my friend."

02:34:45.547 --> 02:34:47.073
TALIESIN: That's perfect.

02:34:47.073 --> 02:34:54.215
MATT: Passes them over. They're all rolled up and
ready to go. "As far as repair kits go, these are

02:34:54.215 --> 02:34:59.954
"a little pricier. If you're looking specifically
for cart repairs, one kit I can sell to you for,

02:34:59.954 --> 02:35:10.465
"say, 25 gold pieces. That contains all that you'd
require for any on-the-road going: wheel repairs,

02:35:10.465 --> 02:35:17.653
"your axle, equipment for keeping your horses
attached to your cart."

02:35:17.653 --> 02:35:21.027
TALIESIN: You wouldn't happen to have any raw
canvas I could use to possibly put a bit of a pup tent?

02:35:21.027 --> 02:35:23.583
MATT: "Raw canvas I can do, but beyond that, the
rest of it's up to you."

02:35:23.583 --> 02:35:27.065
TALIESIN: I'll take the repair kit.

02:35:27.065 --> 02:35:31.614
MATT: "25 gold for that."

02:35:31.614 --> 02:35:36.419
TALIESIN: And however much basic supplies to put
this together, and I'll figure out how handy I am

02:35:36.419 --> 02:35:37.563
on the road.

02:35:37.563 --> 02:35:43.864
MATT: "All right. Rolled canvas here, I've got
about 20 square feet of rolled canvas. Will that do?"

02:35:43.864 --> 02:35:45.062
TALIESIN: Will that do?

02:35:45.062 --> 02:35:46.178
MATT: Will it do?

02:35:46.178 --> 02:35:49.794
TALIESIN: Hmm. I'm used to yards.

02:35:49.794 --> 02:35:52.816
MARISHA: 20 square foot is pretty big.

02:35:52.816 --> 02:35:56.647
TALIESIN: If nothing goes wrong, it should work.
Is it waxed and reasonable?

02:35:56.647 --> 02:36:00.757
MATT: "Reasonable. It's weather-resistant."

02:36:00.757 --> 02:36:03.898
TALIESIN: All right, we'll just have to make a
little--

02:36:03.898 --> 02:36:04.973
MARISHA: A little bubble?

02:36:04.973 --> 02:36:06.009
LAURA: Are we trying to do a covered wagon?

02:36:06.009 --> 02:36:07.228
TALIESIN: We're trying to do a covered wagon.

02:36:07.228 --> 02:36:12.394
MATT: "For the treated canvas, if you're taking
the whole bolt, that's going to be five gold."

02:36:12.394 --> 02:36:14.195
TALIESIN: So we're at 30 gold now.

02:36:14.195 --> 02:36:17.329
MATT: "30 gold, and with the tents, that puts it
at 40 gold."

02:36:17.329 --> 02:36:24.772
TALIESIN: 40 gold. All right, we've got the tents,
we've got the canvas, and then just a little bit

02:36:24.772 --> 02:36:29.271
of lumber to put this whole thing together and
that ought to do it.

02:36:29.271 --> 02:36:31.944
MATT: "Define 'little bit of lumber.' For the
structure?"

02:36:31.944 --> 02:36:34.771
TALIESIN: Yeah, covered wagon-worth.

02:36:34.771 --> 02:36:38.460
MATT: "I don't have much in the way of lumber. I
have a few--"

02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:42.498
TALIESIN: Do you have bamboo? Whatever you have.

02:36:42.498 --> 02:36:50.077
MATT: There's no bamboo. There are wood slats, but
no super-long pieces that could be curved over.

02:36:50.077 --> 02:37:01.785
TALIESIN: All right, at the very least we can fake
something for now. That's fair. What's my total

02:37:01.785 --> 02:37:02.970
right now?

02:37:02.970 --> 02:37:04.131
MATT: "40 gold."

02:37:04.131 --> 02:37:05.327
TALIESIN: I could do 35.

02:37:05.327 --> 02:37:09.799
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:37:09.799 --> 02:37:17.275
TALIESIN: That's a nine! That's nice.

02:37:17.275 --> 02:37:25.236
MATT: "The days grow colder, friend.
Unfortunately, I've got to make ends meet."

02:37:25.236 --> 02:37:28.126
TALIESIN: Can't argue. 40 gold.

02:37:28.126 --> 02:37:29.697
MATT: "40 gold. Fantastic, thank you."

02:37:29.697 --> 02:37:32.194
MARISHA: I toss Percy ten gold to reimburse him a
little bit.

02:37:32.194 --> 02:37:33.977
LIAM: Oh, you did it again! That's not Percy.

02:37:33.977 --> 02:37:37.841
TALIESIN: Two! I got two. One more and I get a
free sandwich. Is that 40 total?

02:37:37.841 --> 02:37:39.717
MATT: 40 total.

02:37:39.717 --> 02:37:43.504
MARISHA: Was it Percy the time before too?

02:37:43.504 --> 02:37:45.040
TRAVIS: Stop saying it, stop saying the name.

02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:47.969
LAURA: No, keep saying it, maybe he'll start
rolling better.

02:37:47.969 --> 02:37:52.316
LIAM: He's got his head shoved up the ass of a
clock right now, leave him be.

02:37:52.316 --> 02:38:00.368
TALIESIN: That was a savage burn. Ugh.

02:38:00.368 --> 02:38:02.884
MATT: Anything else you guys need?

02:38:02.884 --> 02:38:05.365
LAURA: I'm heading back to the cart, spreading out
the leather hides, and making them dry out.

02:38:05.365 --> 02:38:06.960
LIAM: Yeah, what is Fjord doing right now?

02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:08.850
MATT: What is Fjord doing right now?

02:38:08.850 --> 02:38:10.579
TRAVIS: He's fucking bored out of his fucking
shopping mind.

02:38:10.579 --> 02:38:12.233
(laughter)

02:38:12.233 --> 02:38:13.831
LIAM: I see that.

02:38:13.831 --> 02:38:18.734
TRAVIS: He's holding an invisible phone, scrolling
social media.

02:38:18.734 --> 02:38:21.557
MATT: Checking Tinderbox?

02:38:21.557 --> 02:38:26.219
TRAVIS: Any sweet half-orc around here?

02:38:26.219 --> 02:38:29.398
LIAM: You look bored out of your mind.

02:38:29.398 --> 02:38:31.548
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not much of a shopper.

02:38:31.548 --> 02:38:39.885
LIAM: Same, same. Me either. So far, so good,
though, right?

02:38:39.885 --> 02:38:45.196
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's been without incident, which is
what we want.

02:38:45.196 --> 02:38:48.184
LIAM: I mean the lot of it. We've been together
for weeks, now.

02:38:48.184 --> 02:38:51.167
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah.

02:38:51.167 --> 02:38:57.209
LIAM: There's been some friction, but we're still
here.

02:38:57.209 --> 02:39:08.471
TRAVIS: Yeah. Nothing we can't overcome.
Everything's got its little bumps and growing

02:39:08.471 --> 02:39:12.052
pains, and I think we've had ours. You and Beau
seemed to make up nice.

02:39:12.052 --> 02:39:20.070
LIAM: Oh, hell, that was nothing to when you held
a blade to my throat. But we're making it work.

02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:21.972
TRAVIS: Indeed we are.

02:39:21.972 --> 02:39:30.456
LIAM: You're a good guy, I think.

02:39:30.456 --> 02:39:32.880
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think so too.

02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:36.815
LIAM: What does he look like when I say that?

02:39:36.815 --> 02:39:38.776
MATT: What do you look like when--

02:39:38.776 --> 02:39:40.230
TRAVIS: He smiles at you.

02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:45.049
LIAM: No, I know what your face looks like. What
does it mean? Double rainbow, what does it mean?

02:39:45.049 --> 02:39:48.154
TRAVIS: It's a pleasant smile.

02:39:48.154 --> 02:39:50.825
LIAM: Okay.

02:39:50.825 --> 02:39:57.774
SAM: Caleb, Caleb! They have rambutan, they have
lychee, they have jackfruit, they have all sorts

02:39:57.774 --> 02:39:58.862
of different fruits.

02:39:58.862 --> 02:40:00.132
TRAVIS: What did you just say?

02:40:00.132 --> 02:40:01.239
SAM: They have all kinds!

02:40:01.239 --> 02:40:02.435
TRAVIS: What's a lychee?

02:40:02.435 --> 02:40:07.236
SAM: It's a white little-- it's got a big seed,
it's white, it's sort of citrus-y, it's really

02:40:07.236 --> 02:40:09.958
good. You can put it in liquor.

02:40:09.958 --> 02:40:17.706
LIAM: I am from the north. We have Brot,
tomatoes, and cheese and that's it.

02:40:17.706 --> 02:40:19.468
SAM: They may have tomatillo, I don't know.

02:40:19.468 --> 02:40:20.805
LIAM: What?

02:40:20.805 --> 02:40:22.232
SAM: It's really exotic stuff.

02:40:22.232 --> 02:40:26.185
LIAM: Well, you teach me. Good talk. Okay, show me
what you're talking about.

02:40:26.185 --> 02:40:29.768
SAM: Come, come. Do I recognize anyone in any of
these tents?

02:40:29.768 --> 02:40:34.566
MATT: No. You do not.

02:40:34.566 --> 02:40:36.678
LIAM: That's a dirty picture!

02:40:36.678 --> 02:40:38.133
LAURA: No it's not, it's a ballerina.

02:40:38.133 --> 02:40:39.442
LIAM: No, that's a dirty picture.

02:40:39.442 --> 02:40:46.006
MATT: Anything else you guys wish to do? Or do you
move on? Okay. With your supplies gathered, you

02:40:46.006 --> 02:40:52.237
load up back into your cart, and now shifting over
to where you see the signs. The directions show:

02:40:52.237 --> 02:41:03.919
NW - Rillway Road to Berleben/Labenda Swamp, NE -
Gravelway Path to Hupperdook/Silberquel Ridge, and

02:41:03.919 --> 02:41:08.420
then S - Rillway Road to Felderwin/Alfield.

02:41:08.420 --> 02:41:09.750
MARISHA: We want the Hupperdook one.

02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:11.331
TRAVIS: NE, Hupperdook.

02:41:11.331 --> 02:41:16.414
MATT: Making the left turn onto that road, heading
northeast, you begin to make your way towards the

02:41:16.414 --> 02:41:18.124
Silberquel Ridge.

02:41:18.124 --> 02:41:19.795
TRAVIS: I guess we're going slower than that.

02:41:19.795 --> 02:41:23.383
LAURA: Wait! Should I have asked if Kiri was cold?
Do you get cold, Kiri?

02:41:23.383 --> 02:41:29.191
MATT: Kiri's sitting there on the edge, eyes
half-closed, and her feathers all puffed up. She

02:41:29.191 --> 02:41:30.852
looks over towards you, (coos).

02:41:30.852 --> 02:41:32.575
LAURA: Do you get cold? Yes? Or No?

02:41:32.575 --> 02:41:35.474
MATT: (like Jester) "Yes?"

02:41:35.474 --> 02:41:41.451
LAURA: You get cold. Oh, I run back in and try to
get some warm clothes for Kiri.

02:41:41.451 --> 02:41:53.909
MATT: Okay, easy enough. It costs you three silver
to get the proper thick fur material to give her

02:41:53.909 --> 02:41:55.519
enough to keep warm.

02:41:55.519 --> 02:41:57.033
LAURA: Something really pretty though.

02:41:57.033 --> 02:42:02.439
MATT: Eh, beggars can't be choosers in this
circumstance, but you get something functional.

02:42:02.439 --> 02:42:03.367
LAURA: Okay.

02:42:03.367 --> 02:42:05.263
LIAM: Burlap, it's all burlap.

02:42:05.263 --> 02:42:07.176
TALIESIN: Or really itchy wool.

02:42:07.176 --> 02:42:15.405
MATT: Continuing northward, as the sky gets subtly
darker and darker, preparing for what is the

02:42:15.405 --> 02:42:23.089
coming dusk, you see ahead a caravan of carts
heading southward along the road that's going to

02:42:23.089 --> 02:42:24.683
intersect with your path.

02:42:24.683 --> 02:42:25.921
MARISHA: What? What's ahead?

02:42:25.921 --> 02:42:32.019
MATT: A caravan of four carts, heading your
direction, heading southward and going to cross

02:42:32.019 --> 02:42:33.145
your path.

02:42:33.145 --> 02:42:34.762
LAURA: Can we see?

02:42:34.762 --> 02:42:36.321
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:42:36.321 --> 02:42:44.116
LAURA: That was impressive. 15.

02:42:44.116 --> 02:42:50.191
MATT: Okay. Glancing ahead, there's still enough
light for you to make out details. They appear to

02:42:50.191 --> 02:42:57.027
be mostly human from what you can tell. Looking
behind there looks to be a group of dwarf family

02:42:57.027 --> 02:42:59.010
members all gathered. They appear to be families.

02:42:59.010 --> 02:43:01.150
LAURA: Do they look like fancy wagons?

02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:09.266
MATT: They don't. They look like wagons. And as
they begin to approach, they turn and give you a

02:43:09.266 --> 02:43:12.944
wide berth like they're about to make room to
travel past you guys.

02:43:12.944 --> 02:43:15.696
SAM: It could be a diamond shipment.

02:43:15.696 --> 02:43:16.664
LAURA: Maybe we should ask.

02:43:16.664 --> 02:43:19.274
TRAVIS: Howdy! What news from the road up ahead?

02:43:19.274 --> 02:43:27.040
MATT: The gentleman at the front puts a hand up
and the carts slow down a little bit. "Nothing,

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:28.401
"just passing through."

02:43:28.401 --> 02:43:31.864
TRAVIS: No dangers? Clear roads?

02:43:31.864 --> 02:43:34.076
MATT: "Roads are clear so far."

02:43:34.076 --> 02:43:37.426
LIAM: What do the faces of the people who aren't
talking look like?

02:43:37.426 --> 02:43:39.899
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:43:39.899 --> 02:43:47.504
LIAM: 17.

02:43:47.677 --> 02:43:57.063
MATT: 17. There are men, women, children. Mostly
human. Three of the carts, one of them is a dwarf

02:43:57.125 --> 02:44:05.993
family. They all look somewhat nervous. General
looking out, quieting the kids.

02:44:06.062 --> 02:44:09.155
LAURA: Have you been to Hupperdook?

02:44:09.155 --> 02:44:11.970
MATT: "We rode past, didn't stop."

02:44:11.970 --> 02:44:13.841
LAURA: Did you see the mushroom houses?

02:44:13.841 --> 02:44:16.686
MATT: "No."

02:44:16.686 --> 02:44:17.693
LAURA: Damn it.

02:44:17.693 --> 02:44:22.968
MARISHA: Did you party any? Quick rager after the
kids were asleep?

02:44:22.968 --> 02:44:24.580
MATT: "No. I'm sorry, we must be going."

02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:26.450
SAM: There was no blazing drum and bass?

02:44:26.450 --> 02:44:32.379
MATT: The horses pick up their pace a bit more.

02:44:32.379 --> 02:44:35.167
SAM: I don't believe you.

02:44:35.224 --> 02:44:37.375
TRAVIS: What do the kids do as they move on?

02:44:37.375 --> 02:44:41.737
MATT: The kids just kind of watch quietly as they
begin to pass.

02:44:41.737 --> 02:44:45.330
TRAVIS: I didn't like his demeanor.

02:44:45.330 --> 02:44:47.248
LAURA: No. (shouts) Where are you going? Are you
safe?

02:44:47.248 --> 02:44:49.413
SAM: (laughs) We are the worst people.

02:44:49.413 --> 02:44:51.363
MATT: He looks back and says, "We're heading
south."

02:44:51.363 --> 02:44:52.659
SAM: (shouts) What are you reading? What are you
reading?

02:44:52.659 --> 02:44:56.134
(laughter)

02:44:56.134 --> 02:44:58.208
MATT: "We're just passing through. Heading
south."

02:44:58.208 --> 02:45:04.790
LAURA: I look at one of the kids. (whispers) Are
you safe? Are you good? Are you safe?

02:45:04.790 --> 02:45:10.661
MATT: The kid kind of recoils from this
blue-skinned, horned tiefling all of a sudden

02:45:10.661 --> 02:45:15.146
engaging him from across the way. The kid just
kind of freezes in place.

02:45:15.146 --> 02:45:19.010
LAURA: I don't know. I feel like they would've
said if they were in danger or something.

02:45:19.010 --> 02:45:21.724
MARISHA: Trafficking kids?

02:45:21.724 --> 02:45:27.067
LAURA: Yeah. I'm afraid it's like... I don't know,
I just feel like somebody's not safe there.

02:45:27.067 --> 02:45:29.413
SAM: All right, I'll cast Message on one of the
kids.

02:45:29.413 --> 02:45:30.565
LAURA: Okay. Okay.

02:45:30.565 --> 02:45:31.873
MATT: Okay.

02:45:31.873 --> 02:45:35.699
SAM: I'll say, if you're being kidnapped, you can
respond to this message and tell me.

02:45:35.699 --> 02:45:41.296
MATT: There's a pause, and the kid that you're
aiming at goes... Like big smile on the face.

02:45:41.296 --> 02:45:51.584
Looks over and sees you and kind of... "No, we're
just getting away... from our home."

02:45:51.584 --> 02:45:56.167
SAM: That was like a real connection!

02:45:56.167 --> 02:45:59.981
LAURA: Ask what's happening at their home!

02:45:59.981 --> 02:46:04.290
SAM: Okay. I'll cast it again. Where's home? You
can respond to this message!

02:46:04.290 --> 02:46:05.937
MATT: "Nogvurot."

02:46:05.937 --> 02:46:12.035
LAURA: Nogvurot. Oh, that's where the people have
been getting stolen from! People are getting

02:46:12.035 --> 02:46:13.303
stolen, remember?

02:46:13.303 --> 02:46:19.845
MARISHA: Wait. Yeah, Nogvurot is right where we're
going. We're going past Shady... Shadycreek.

02:46:19.845 --> 02:46:21.145
SAM: There's been a string of kidnappings there in
town.

02:46:21.145 --> 02:46:23.073
MATT: Well, this is where you're going, and
Nogvurot is this way.

02:46:23.073 --> 02:46:24.919
LAURA: Oh, okay, so we can sort of avoid--

02:46:24.919 --> 02:46:26.832
MATT: You can go straight, or you can arc-- it'll
take more time.

02:46:26.832 --> 02:46:28.439
MARISHA: But they're next-doorsies.

02:46:28.439 --> 02:46:30.851
LAURA: We should avoid Nogvurot right now.

02:46:30.851 --> 02:46:34.410
MATT: You can hit it on the way back. It's up to
you.

02:46:34.410 --> 02:46:35.960
MARISHA: Yeah. On the way back. On the way back.

02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:42.121
LAURA: After we've already taken care of the stuff
so we get paid. Do we know how much time we have

02:46:42.121 --> 02:46:45.294
left before our time is up with the Gentleman's
timeline?

02:46:45.294 --> 02:46:50.213
MATT: Uh, with the days of travel... I'd have to
go do the math again, and I'm sure that the

02:46:50.213 --> 02:46:52.032
Internet knows and has been keeping track--

02:46:52.032 --> 02:46:53.089
TALIESIN: I think we're probably fine.

02:46:53.089 --> 02:46:54.420
MATT: I'll check in with CritRoleStats to make
sure--

02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:55.619
LIAM: And Caleb will tell the group.

02:46:55.619 --> 02:47:03.681
MATT: But since you've left, just estimating right
now, I'd say it's been about a little over a week

02:47:03.681 --> 02:47:05.114
as of now.

02:47:05.114 --> 02:47:06.147
LAURA: And we have a month.

02:47:06.147 --> 02:47:06.991
MATT: You have a month.

02:47:06.991 --> 02:47:08.329
TALIESIN: We're killing it.

02:47:08.329 --> 02:47:11.396
LAURA: Okay. This is going to be the hard stuff
now.

02:47:11.396 --> 02:47:12.529
SAM: Let's continue on.

02:47:12.529 --> 02:47:13.854
TALIESIN: We're basically gods.

02:47:13.854 --> 02:47:20.720
LIAM: Caleb is futzing again with the rock and
just sort of massaging the four days of stubble

02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:26.071
that he has grown back, and his facial hair comes
in as fast as Liam's does so it's already pretty thick.

02:47:26.071 --> 02:47:33.810
MATT: All right. You pass the caravan and they
continue southward. Eventually it gets dark, if

02:47:33.810 --> 02:47:38.905
you guys want to stop and make a rest for the
evening, you can. So, as you set off and set up

02:47:38.905 --> 02:47:40.431
camp, who's keeping watch this evening?

02:47:40.431 --> 02:47:41.651
TALIESIN: We've got tents!

02:47:41.651 --> 02:47:42.813
ASHLEY: I'll keep watch.

02:47:42.813 --> 02:47:45.879
MATT: All right. And you do have new tents, which
is much more comfortable than the open air,

02:47:45.879 --> 02:47:49.458
bundled up with your blanket in the cold night.
And as you travel further north, you know, it's

02:47:49.458 --> 02:47:54.121
going to get colder, especially with the winter
looming and the autumn coming to a close.

02:47:54.121 --> 02:47:56.063
SAM: One of us bought warm clothes.

02:47:56.063 --> 02:47:57.658
(laughter)

02:47:57.658 --> 02:47:58.824
MATT: All right, who's keeping watch?

02:47:58.824 --> 02:48:00.396
TRAVIS and SAM: Yasha and Beau.

02:48:00.396 --> 02:48:02.960
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a roll, guys.
Or one of you with advantage. Your choice.

02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:06.545
SAM: Beau's just looking at Yasha.

02:48:06.545 --> 02:48:10.733
MARISHA: Her bad. Did you see anything?

02:48:10.733 --> 02:48:12.106
ASHLEY: 15.

02:48:12.106 --> 02:48:13.224
MATT: 15? Okay.

02:48:13.224 --> 02:48:14.644
MARISHA: Because I don't see anything.

02:48:14.644 --> 02:48:16.258
(laughter)

02:48:16.258 --> 02:48:17.614
LIAM: Except for your eyes.

02:48:17.614 --> 02:48:18.755
SAM: They're like the ocean.

02:48:18.755 --> 02:48:20.230
LAURA: Her eyes are like the sea.

02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:22.581
MARISHA: Your eyes are like the swamp. Super
muddy.

02:48:22.581 --> 02:48:24.110
LIAM: Your eyes are like blue crayons.

02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:29.938
MARISHA: One's like the swamp, one's like the
sky.

02:48:29.938 --> 02:48:31.564
ASHLEY: Yeah...

02:48:31.564 --> 02:48:33.309
LAURA: (laughs)

02:48:33.309 --> 02:48:37.298
ASHLEY: Yeah. I mean, one's like more purpley, but
I guess that's sky, or swamp?

02:48:37.298 --> 02:48:43.752
MARISHA: Yeah. It's very like, very diverse
biodomes in your eyes.

02:48:43.752 --> 02:48:47.157
LIAM: Ooh.

02:48:47.157 --> 02:48:48.577
TALIESIN: (whispers) How?

02:48:48.577 --> 02:48:49.726
ASHLEY: Yeah...

02:48:49.726 --> 02:48:51.147
MATT: Not biome. Biodome.

02:48:51.147 --> 02:48:52.240
MARISHA: (laughs) Biodomes, you know?

02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:53.381
ASHLEY: Like a... I think that's a film?

02:48:53.381 --> 02:48:55.592
MARISHA: You know, like-- Yeah. Waterworld.

02:48:55.592 --> 02:48:56.744
TRAVIS: Pauly Shore movie.

02:48:56.744 --> 02:48:57.614
MARISHA: Let's go.

02:48:57.614 --> 02:48:58.847
LIAM: We're off the rails. We're off the rails.

02:48:58.847 --> 02:48:59.789
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:48:59.789 --> 02:49:04.283
MATT: All right. The evening passes without issue,
actually. Keeping a watch--

02:49:04.283 --> 02:49:05.742
TRAVIS: You call that "without issue?"

02:49:05.742 --> 02:49:07.051
MATT: Well--

02:49:07.051 --> 02:49:08.586
MARISHA: It's natural. It's in my blood.

02:49:08.586 --> 02:49:09.758
MATT: Touche.

02:49:09.758 --> 02:49:13.039
LIAM: You're so cool, how do you fucking eat
gravel so hard? Oh, man.

02:49:13.039 --> 02:49:14.987
MARISHA: It's in my blood, man. It's all a ruse.

02:49:14.987 --> 02:49:23.648
MATT: So. You wake up the next morning. You get
the sense that, being the vigilant beast that you

02:49:23.648 --> 02:49:31.390
are, if anybody wanted to come close to inspect,
immediately saw Yasha and went, "Nope!" You

02:49:31.390 --> 02:49:39.211
continue on the next day of travel. Heading
upward. Northeast, further and further. You can

02:49:39.211 --> 02:49:45.034
begin to see the edge of the Silberquel Ridge, the
mountain range that, when you were approaching the

02:49:45.034 --> 02:49:50.620
Labenda Swamp, began to rise and kind of loomed
over the swamp, and then began to slowly get more

02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:55.344
distant. As you traveled southward the crossroads
begins to come further into view again. The

02:49:55.344 --> 02:50:01.608
mountain range moving closer, more massive, kind
of peeking over, this large-- it's very, very

02:50:01.608 --> 02:50:07.524
steep edges to the base of this mountain range.
You get the sense that passage over or through is

02:50:07.524 --> 02:50:19.427
very specific. Or at least nowhere in visible
sight. As you guys begin to crest into dusk for

02:50:19.427 --> 02:50:23.821
this next, fourth evening of travel, who's keeping
watch?

02:50:23.821 --> 02:50:25.452
SAM: Me and Caleb.

02:50:25.452 --> 02:50:27.553
MATT: All right. You guys go ahead and roll
perception checks, please.

02:50:27.553 --> 02:50:29.734
SAM: Six.

02:50:29.734 --> 02:50:31.899
LIAM: 13.

02:50:31.899 --> 02:50:40.297
MATT: 13. All right. As you guys are just setting
up, Caleb, you're looking out past as everyone

02:50:40.297 --> 02:50:43.699
else is getting ready to bed for the night, and
you look over and you can see what looks like a

02:50:43.699 --> 02:50:51.683
shape off in the grass. Looks like a-- like a big
mound, but it's hard to tell from this distance,

02:50:51.683 --> 02:50:52.876
but there's something in the grass.

02:50:52.876 --> 02:50:56.607
LIAM: There's something deadly out there that
wants to murder us all in our sleep.

02:50:56.607 --> 02:50:59.316
SAM: Well, it could just be an animal or
something, right?

02:50:59.316 --> 02:51:02.402
LIAM: Yeah, it could be. Do you want to wake
everybody up, or--

02:51:02.402 --> 02:51:03.670
SAM: Not yet, let's find out what it is.

02:51:03.670 --> 02:51:06.215
LIAM: Well, I can't see shit!

02:51:06.215 --> 02:51:09.208
SAM: I'll go look. You stay here and be ready to
wake.

02:51:09.208 --> 02:51:15.549
LIAM: Okay, well, hold on a second. Just wear my
cat as a scarf. And she digs-- dammit, my cat was

02:51:15.549 --> 02:51:22.531
a girl, but-- never mind. He digs his claws into
Nott's neck and hangs in.

02:51:22.531 --> 02:51:26.487
SAM: I'll flank around and try to see if I can see
what this thing is.

02:51:26.487 --> 02:51:32.798
LIAM: And Caleb sits between Fjord and Beau and
loses his sight and vision and listens.

02:51:32.798 --> 02:51:36.006
MATT: All right. So make a stealth check, please.

02:51:36.006 --> 02:51:37.109
SAM: One.

02:51:37.109 --> 02:51:38.851
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:51:38.851 --> 02:51:41.296
SAM: Plus ten, but it was a natural one.

02:51:41.296 --> 02:51:42.815
MATT: Still a natural one.

02:51:42.815 --> 02:51:44.128
LIAM: Fuck a duck!

02:51:44.128 --> 02:51:45.860
(laughter)

02:51:45.860 --> 02:51:50.874
SAM: Get out of my eyeline! Get out of my eyeline,
Wil Wheaton!

02:51:50.874 --> 02:51:55.018
(laughter)

02:51:55.018 --> 02:51:57.584
LIAM: It's a 30-foot radius!

02:51:57.584 --> 02:52:04.311
SAM: You have sunglasses or anything I could
wear?

02:52:04.311 --> 02:52:06.895
(laughter)

02:52:06.895 --> 02:52:11.227
MATT: As you begin to slowly approach, make a
perception check, please.

02:52:11.227 --> 02:52:13.104
SAM: That's a 12.

02:52:13.104 --> 02:52:15.763
LIAM: Do I get to make a perception check through
Frumpkin's ears?

02:52:15.763 --> 02:52:17.330
MATT: Sure.

02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:18.412
LIAM: Yass!

02:52:18.412 --> 02:52:19.996
SAM: Queen.

02:52:19.996 --> 02:52:21.296
LIAM: It's a two!

02:52:21.296 --> 02:52:22.390
(laughter)

02:52:22.390 --> 02:52:30.585
MATT: All right. You hear nothing. You glance
around the corner, and just beyond the grass, you

02:52:30.585 --> 02:52:33.185
can see an overturned cart.

02:52:33.185 --> 02:52:34.952
SAM: Not ours.

02:52:34.952 --> 02:52:41.256
MATT: Not yours. Another cart. It's just on its
side. It looks like it has a cover over the top of

02:52:41.256 --> 02:52:44.463
it. But it's not--

02:52:44.463 --> 02:52:45.866
SAM: But that's not where we saw movement?

02:52:45.866 --> 02:52:47.676
LIAM: No, we just saw a hump, right?

02:52:47.676 --> 02:52:52.329
MATT: You saw the shape. And the shape, as you
approach, looks to be an overturned wagon, roughly

02:52:52.329 --> 02:52:53.991
about 100 feet off the road.

02:52:53.991 --> 02:53:03.385
SAM: Okay. I will cast Silent Image, and I will
make it look like there's just a curious human

02:53:03.385 --> 02:53:06.307
walking over there. (bad American accent) Hi, I'm
an American man!

02:53:06.307 --> 02:53:09.886
(laughter)

02:53:09.886 --> 02:53:15.590
LIAM: I pull out a wire and say, You're onto this,
right? This is a possible ambush, ja?

02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:23.082
SAM: It seems like-- yeah? So, Chent goes over
there and checks it out.

02:53:23.082 --> 02:53:24.355
TRAVIS: Chent?

02:53:24.355 --> 02:53:25.958
TALIESIN: When have you ever met a Chent?

02:53:25.958 --> 02:53:27.314
SAM: You know, good old Chent.

02:53:27.314 --> 02:53:28.421
MARISHA: I already hate him.

02:53:28.421 --> 02:53:38.071
MATT: Walks over there. Make a perception check.

02:53:38.071 --> 02:53:41.850
TRAVIS: He got a sweater around his neck and
mid-thigh khaki shorts?

02:53:41.850 --> 02:53:43.055
MATT: 13?

02:53:43.055 --> 02:53:44.377
MARISHA: Crocs? Is he wearing Crocs?

02:53:44.377 --> 02:53:45.570
MATT: Nothing.

02:53:45.570 --> 02:53:48.013
SAM: Abercrombie and Fitch top.

02:53:48.013 --> 02:53:49.856
(laughter)

02:53:49.856 --> 02:53:51.959
LIAM: Tell your man to check the cart.

02:53:51.959 --> 02:53:58.143
SAM: Yeah, he's over there investigating. Nothing?
Okay. I will withdraw him if nothing has

02:53:58.143 --> 02:53:59.067
happened.

02:53:59.067 --> 02:54:00.105
MATT: Okay.

02:54:00.105 --> 02:54:05.247
SAM: I didn't-- I take out my wire-- I didn't see
anything move. I think it might just be a cart.

02:54:05.247 --> 02:54:08.836
LIAM: Probably but give it a moment.

02:54:08.836 --> 02:54:11.274
SAM: Okay. I'll wait.

02:54:11.274 --> 02:54:14.158
LIAM: Tell him to do the Running Man.

02:54:14.158 --> 02:54:19.342
SAM: He's not a good dancer; he's a white guy.

02:54:19.342 --> 02:54:22.862
(laughter)

02:54:22.862 --> 02:54:25.775
LIAM: Ja I can relate, but just do it.

02:54:25.775 --> 02:54:29.485
TRAVIS: White man's overbite, white man's
overbite-- there it is!

02:54:29.485 --> 02:54:31.897
TALIESIN: Can't handle.

02:54:31.897 --> 02:54:35.395
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:54:35.395 --> 02:54:38.208
SAM: Okay. 15 now.

02:54:38.208 --> 02:54:45.078
MATT: 15. You see a brief-- a split-second of
movement. And you look and you see a crossbow bolt

02:54:45.078 --> 02:54:46.676
hit the edge of the cart--

02:54:46.676 --> 02:54:48.816
SAM: Near where Chent was?

02:54:48.816 --> 02:54:51.761
MATT: Near where he was standing. Who is still
dancing.

02:54:51.761 --> 02:54:57.906
SAM: Oh, shit. No direction? Can I tell from its
impact from whence it came?

02:54:57.967 --> 02:54:59.168
MATT: Not from this distance, no.

02:54:59.168 --> 02:55:03.938
SAM: Okay. (panicked breathing) Crossbow attack!
Crossbow attack! Wake up everyone! I'll take them

02:55:03.938 --> 02:55:05.176
out single-handed!

02:55:05.176 --> 02:55:09.407
LIAM: No, no, no, switch to the Cabbage Patch! And
I start punching Fjord and Beau in the shoulders.

02:55:09.407 --> 02:55:10.350
MARISHA: (groans)

02:55:10.350 --> 02:55:12.044
LIAM: Shh! Quiet! Be quiet!

02:55:12.044 --> 02:55:18.613
SAM: I'm going to keep flanking around in the
shadows, trying to stay out of trouble. Crossbow

02:55:18.613 --> 02:55:19.666
at the ready.

02:55:19.666 --> 02:55:24.852
LIAM: I start quietly handing over everybody's
mouth, "Wake up, there's an ambush!" I'm scared of

02:55:24.852 --> 02:55:27.134
Yasha but I do it anyway. "Wake up, there's an
ambush!"

02:55:27.134 --> 02:55:39.127
MATT: As all of you come to consciousness, you
glance over and you can see the dark shape, once

02:55:39.127 --> 02:55:50.270
Caleb points out the direction where it was. And
as you're coming around the side, Nott... because

02:55:50.270 --> 02:55:52.467
you did not roll a very good stealth--

02:55:52.467 --> 02:55:53.847
SAM: No, no, not at all.

02:55:53.847 --> 02:55:56.471
TRAVIS: You went forward and did not retreat?

02:55:56.471 --> 02:55:58.055
SAM: I was trying to flank around.

02:55:58.055 --> 02:56:04.521
MATT: You suffer six points of piercing damage as
a crossbow bolt catches you in the thigh.

02:56:04.521 --> 02:56:07.833
SAM: (groans) I will reduce that to three.

02:56:07.833 --> 02:56:12.375
MATT: All right. You glance over to the side and
you can see what looks to be a humanoid shape that

02:56:12.375 --> 02:56:15.033
darts down into the grass and begins shifting
around the other side of the cart.

02:56:15.033 --> 02:56:18.651
LIAM: Caleb will, at this point, once everyone is
awake-- Yasha was the last one-- go back in

02:56:18.651 --> 02:56:27.551
to see what is going on. Oh, shit. (stammering)
Nott's being attacked. Let's go! And I jump out of

02:56:27.551 --> 02:56:28.755
the cart.

02:56:28.755 --> 02:56:30.115
SAM: Did I see where the creature went?

02:56:30.115 --> 02:56:34.688
MATT: Yeah. It ran down through the grass--
actually, make a perception check, just as you're

02:56:34.688 --> 02:56:36.588
trying to peer through the darkness here.

02:56:36.588 --> 02:56:37.559
SAM: Six.

02:56:37.559 --> 02:56:40.756
MATT: Yeah, you have no idea. They vanished into
the grass and moved what you assume to be around

02:56:40.756 --> 02:56:41.754
the cart.

02:56:41.754 --> 02:56:44.416
LIAM: I am doing my best Vax impression and making
my way through the grass.

02:56:44.416 --> 02:56:45.777
MATT: All right. The rest of you following?

02:56:45.777 --> 02:56:46.648
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:56:46.648 --> 02:56:47.640
MATT: All right. You guys are all--

02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:48.823
ASHLEY: I start walking towards the--

02:56:48.823 --> 02:56:50.351
MATT: Not carefully, just straight-on run in that
space?

02:56:50.351 --> 02:56:53.769
MARISHA: No! Spread and flank? Spread and flank?

02:56:53.769 --> 02:56:54.816
LIAM: Still stealthing.

02:56:54.816 --> 02:56:56.575
MATT: You're still stealthing?

02:56:56.575 --> 02:56:57.405
LIAM: I'm trying!

02:56:57.405 --> 02:57:01.978
MATT: I'd like all of you guys to make a stealth
check, please. As you try and carefully approach.

02:57:01.978 --> 02:57:06.142
At the slow pace at which you are approaching, at
that many feet away--

02:57:06.142 --> 02:57:07.606
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:57:07.606 --> 02:57:08.447
MATT: Nice!

02:57:08.447 --> 02:57:09.370
TALIESIN: Natural one!

02:57:09.370 --> 02:57:10.229
ASHLEY: 16.

02:57:10.229 --> 02:57:11.097
MATT: Natural one?

02:57:11.097 --> 02:57:12.483
LIAM: 14.

02:57:12.483 --> 02:57:13.399
MARISHA: 14.

02:57:13.399 --> 02:57:14.398
TRAVIS: Four.

02:57:14.398 --> 02:57:20.832
MATT: Four. Okay, Fjord and Molly lumbering across
the field. In the meantime, two other figures

02:57:20.832 --> 02:57:28.925
jump up from aside the cart, and both take
crossbow shots at you. That's going to be a 16?

02:57:28.987 --> 02:57:30.512
SAM: Armor class is 16.

02:57:30.512 --> 02:57:33.652
MATT: Just hits. And the other one is-- that's a
12. That doesn't hit.

02:57:33.652 --> 02:57:34.528
SAM: Okay.

02:57:34.528 --> 02:57:37.397
MATT: So this one... you're going to take four
points of piercing damage.

02:57:37.461 --> 02:57:41.786
SAM: I already used my, whatever, reaction, so
I'll take the full four.

02:57:41.786 --> 02:57:49.414
MATT: Okay. They both kind of duck down behind,
using the cart to put a buffer between you and them.

02:57:49.414 --> 02:57:50.677
SAM: So now I kind of know where they are.

02:57:50.677 --> 02:57:51.725
MATT: You know where they are, yes.

02:57:51.725 --> 02:57:52.746
SAM: But they're hiding.

02:57:52.746 --> 02:57:53.581
MATT: Correct.

02:57:53.581 --> 02:57:56.042
TRAVIS: Hiding in the grass. Caleb, light 'em up.

02:57:56.042 --> 02:58:00.145
MATT: You guys are rushing in that direction. You
can see, you see two figures dart up and then Nott

02:58:00.145 --> 02:58:04.423
kind of like (grunt). Nott is very visible in
the field.

02:58:04.423 --> 02:58:10.418
SAM: Can I use my action to message them saying,
"There's two or three figures behind the cart!"

02:58:10.418 --> 02:58:12.605
and then I'll hide?

02:58:12.605 --> 02:58:17.772
LIAM: And Caleb heard Fjord say that and just went
(fwoof) and there's four globes floating above us.

02:58:17.772 --> 02:58:19.499
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

02:58:19.499 --> 02:58:24.965
MATT: Okay, you Invoke Duplicity. As Jester's
stealthing below through the field, two Jesters

02:58:24.965 --> 02:58:26.546
suddenly appear where once there was one.

02:58:26.546 --> 02:58:29.319
LAURA: And I'm going to send her out next to
Molly.

02:58:29.319 --> 02:58:31.687
MATT: All right. Molly and Fjord, you guys rush
forward as the little globes of light all of a

02:58:31.687 --> 02:58:36.644
sudden light the area up a bit, like it has a very
faint lantern light in the vicinity.

02:58:36.644 --> 02:58:40.368
MARISHA: I'm going to move on the opposite side of
where Nott is and do like a quick runaround and

02:58:40.368 --> 02:58:41.331
try and flank.

02:58:41.331 --> 02:58:42.597
MATT: Okay. Fjord?

02:58:42.597 --> 02:58:45.005
TRAVIS: Yep, just swinging wide. On Beau's side.

02:58:45.005 --> 02:58:48.091
MATT: All right. As you guys rush around, Yasha,
what are you doing?

02:58:48.091 --> 02:58:50.254
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm swinging wide. Go around.

02:58:50.254 --> 02:58:56.421
MATT: Okay, you guys swing wide around. At this
point, you see the figures, five of them, all pop

02:58:56.421 --> 02:59:00.663
up, two of them in the field off to the side that
you weren't paying attention, dart up, and the

02:59:00.663 --> 02:59:04.686
three from behind go ahead and the three are going
to take shots at Nott as well in the center.

02:59:04.686 --> 02:59:19.131
That's 21. That's an 18. And 17. So that's six
points of piercing damage, six points of piercing

02:59:19.131 --> 02:59:27.637
damage, and seven points of piercing damage.
Nott's just being pummeled by bolts, and as Fjord

02:59:27.637 --> 02:59:32.287
and Molly start rushing up, a fifth one off to the
side goes ahead and makes a shot towards Molly.

02:59:32.287 --> 02:59:35.262
That's going to be a 19 to hit.

02:59:35.262 --> 02:59:36.237
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that hits.

02:59:36.237 --> 02:59:41.998
MATT: You take seven points of piercing damage,
and the other one goes and aims towards Molly and

02:59:41.998 --> 02:59:51.859
goes, "Wait. Oh God! Stop, stop, stop! Stop your
fighting!" You see the other dark figures look.

02:59:51.859 --> 02:59:54.617
Their heads swing over in that direction. What are
you guys doing?

02:59:54.617 --> 02:59:58.580
MARISHA: Taking out the closest guy that's to me.

02:59:58.580 --> 03:00:02.240
MATT: Okay, the one that's closest to you is the
one that shot Molly. He popped out of the grass as

03:00:02.240 --> 03:00:03.389
you were pulling around the side.

03:00:03.389 --> 03:00:04.552
MARISHA: The one who's yelling?

03:00:04.552 --> 03:00:07.271
MATT: No, the other one. The one that's shouting
is on the opposite end.

03:00:07.271 --> 03:00:09.012
LIAM: They're really spread out? How spread out?

03:00:09.012 --> 03:00:15.949
MATT: I'd say if you're looking at where the cart
is, there's two on the sides here that were in the

03:00:15.949 --> 03:00:17.696
grass, and there's three that are directly behind
the cart.

03:00:17.696 --> 03:00:20.204
LIAM: Roughly how far apart are those two?

03:00:20.204 --> 03:00:22.075
MATT: They're about 60 feet apart.

03:00:22.075 --> 03:00:33.896
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to hold Slow for one side of
the group if I decide they're a threat, if they

03:00:33.896 --> 03:00:35.141
sound like a threat.

03:00:35.141 --> 03:00:38.201
MATT: Well, you have to release it next round or
the spell's lost.

03:00:38.201 --> 03:00:39.870
LIAM: Yeah, that's fine.

03:00:39.870 --> 03:00:42.590
MATT: Okay. You prepare, you're readying Slow.

03:00:42.590 --> 03:00:47.017
TRAVIS: Do we see any visual of the face of
whoever is yelling that?

03:00:47.017 --> 03:00:49.344
MATT: There's very little light except for a
little bit of light that's coming from the sky.

03:00:49.344 --> 03:00:55.253
The globes are like a lantern light, but it's the
middle of the night, so you can see the shapes.

03:00:55.253 --> 03:00:58.167
They're not able to hide at the moment, but you
don't see any features or details as you're

03:00:58.167 --> 03:01:02.256
rushing up. Make a perception check.

03:01:02.256 --> 03:01:04.796
SAM: Do they see that Chent is now doing the
Sprinkler?

03:01:04.796 --> 03:01:08.553
MATT: They are aware.

03:01:08.553 --> 03:01:09.927
TRAVIS: 14.

03:01:09.927 --> 03:01:18.236
MATT: You do notice that all of them have thick
green cloth masks that cover the front of their

03:01:18.236 --> 03:01:23.817
faces, bandit-style, that cover most of the
features.

03:01:23.817 --> 03:01:26.837
MARISHA: I'm cracking the one on the head.

03:01:26.837 --> 03:01:28.415
MATT: Go for it. As you rush up, go for it.

03:01:28.415 --> 03:01:32.078
MARISHA: Does he see me? I'm trying to do this
stealthily.

03:01:32.078 --> 03:01:33.301
MATT: He just finished firing.

03:01:33.301 --> 03:01:39.021
MARISHA: Okay, while his attention is diverted,
I'm going to come up behind and try and do a

03:01:39.021 --> 03:01:40.580
crack. Go to sleep, go to sleep.

03:01:40.580 --> 03:01:41.511
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:01:41.511 --> 03:01:43.159
MARISHA: Do I have advantage on this or anything?

03:01:43.159 --> 03:01:46.858
MATT: The first attack you do, because he turns
and sees you at the last minute as you approach.

03:01:46.858 --> 03:01:49.357
MARISHA: 16.

03:01:49.357 --> 03:01:50.690
MATT: 16 hits.

03:01:50.690 --> 03:01:58.805
MARISHA: Okay. That's 12 damage, and I'm going to
do stunning blow.

03:01:58.805 --> 03:02:01.318
MATT: All right. Stunning Strike?

03:02:01.318 --> 03:02:02.911
MARISHA: Stunning Strike. Is that a ki thing?

03:02:02.911 --> 03:02:07.195
MATT: Yeah, it spends a ki to do it. Yeah, he does
not succeed. He rolled a natural eight. He's

03:02:07.195 --> 03:02:09.763
(groaning) kidney punch right to the side.

03:02:09.763 --> 03:02:15.647
MARISHA: I'm going to cover his mouth and lay him
down in the grass, and do another blow to his

03:02:15.647 --> 03:02:17.831
temple to try and knock him out.

03:02:17.831 --> 03:02:20.999
SAM: And kill him.

03:02:20.999 --> 03:02:23.527
MARISHA: Nope, just knock him unconscious. Do I
roll?

03:02:23.527 --> 03:02:27.647
MATT: Roll with advantage, because he's stunned
currently.

03:02:27.647 --> 03:02:30.917
MARISHA: Natural 20! Thanks, Gil.

03:02:30.917 --> 03:02:34.380
MATT: You (whack) and his eyes roll back.

03:02:34.380 --> 03:02:37.216
MARISHA: (shushing) Lay him down in the grass.

03:02:37.216 --> 03:02:39.318
TRAVIS: Quickly, declare yourselves.

03:02:39.318 --> 03:02:41.016
TALIESIN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:02:41.016 --> 03:02:48.670
MATT: The one guy stands up-- the guy who yelled
out-- and goes, "We are so sorry! We are so sorry!

03:02:48.670 --> 03:02:54.608
"We didn't know it was you folks! Our most sincere
apologies." The other guy is like, "What the fuck

03:02:54.608 --> 03:02:58.821
"are you talking about?" He's like, "You don't
understand. These are the ones that--"

03:02:58.821 --> 03:03:00.848
TALIESIN: How's new management working out?

03:03:00.848 --> 03:03:05.961
MATT: "These are the ones that ashed Trevor!" The
guys put up their hands. "Oh shit. We're so

03:03:05.961 --> 03:03:07.530
"sorry!" They drop their crossbows.

03:03:07.530 --> 03:03:09.593
LIAM: Caleb lets Slow fizzle.

03:03:09.593 --> 03:03:15.685
MATT: "We didn't mean nothing. We're so sorry."

03:03:15.685 --> 03:03:18.060
SAM: I'm going to fire one crossbow bolt at that
guy.

03:03:18.060 --> 03:03:19.038
MATT: Go for it.

03:03:19.038 --> 03:03:21.399
SAM: Oh, it's only a 13.

03:03:21.399 --> 03:03:26.210
MATT: It's leather armor. It hits. They're not
very strong.

03:03:26.210 --> 03:03:28.293
SAM: Eight points of damage.

03:03:28.293 --> 03:03:30.418
MATT: He goes, "Oh! Come on!"

03:03:30.418 --> 03:03:32.078
SAM: It doesn't feel good, does it?

03:03:32.078 --> 03:03:35.559
TALIESIN: Now, now. Is that apology accepted at
this point?

03:03:35.559 --> 03:03:40.681
LAURA: Do you guys have healing potions, because
you just sent a lot of arrows at Nott. I mean at

03:03:40.681 --> 03:03:42.421
this-- I mean--

03:03:42.421 --> 03:03:44.952
TRAVIS: You said her name. It's all right.

03:03:44.952 --> 03:03:52.069
MATT: "We don't have much. We're so sorry.
Seriously, this is a huge misunderstanding."

03:03:52.128 --> 03:03:57.159
TALIESIN: I'm going to put this out here, that we
just received an apology. This sort of behavior

03:03:57.159 --> 03:03:58.534
should be rewarded.

03:03:58.534 --> 03:03:59.458
LAURA: You know the drill.

03:03:59.458 --> 03:04:00.529
MATT: "Thank you. Thank you!"

03:04:00.529 --> 03:04:02.910
LAURA: Take off your pants and walk away.

03:04:02.910 --> 03:04:04.663
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:04:04.663 --> 03:04:10.287
LIAM: Also leave one gift for us before you go.
Because you're living.

03:04:10.287 --> 03:04:15.465
LAURA: I rolled a one. No pants for me.

03:04:15.465 --> 03:04:16.778
MATT: Aw. No.

03:04:16.778 --> 03:04:21.346
TALIESIN: We appreciate the courtesy.

03:04:21.346 --> 03:04:35.169
MATT: He pulls the mask down. "Take the cart. Take
it. That's yours. We'll just--" The other one's

03:04:35.169 --> 03:04:37.354
like, "What the fuck are you doing, mate?" He's
like, "Trust me!"

03:04:37.354 --> 03:04:42.194
LIAM: Ja, we have a cart. We're good. Is there
anything in the cart that is more interesting?

03:04:42.194 --> 03:04:43.645
MATT: "Whatever's in it, it's all yours."

03:04:43.645 --> 03:04:45.818
LIAM: Back away from that cart, please.

03:04:45.818 --> 03:04:48.779
MATT: "Right, that we do. Guys, gentlemen, back
away."

03:04:48.779 --> 03:04:52.375
TALIESIN: It's rough out here; they should take
their crossbows.

03:04:52.375 --> 03:04:56.731
LIAM: I am not taking their clothes, but I am
interested to see what they are carrying.

03:04:56.731 --> 03:04:57.925
TALIESIN: That is very fair, let's take a look.

03:04:57.925 --> 03:05:01.967
TRAVIS: Is that your cart, or did it belong to
someone before you?

03:05:01.967 --> 03:05:04.812
MATT: "It belonged to someone. They're alive. We
didn't kill them, but we took their stuff and we

03:05:04.812 --> 03:05:06.033
"sent them on their way."

03:05:06.033 --> 03:05:06.960
LIAM: Are you bullshitting us?

03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:07.781
MATT: "No!"

03:05:07.781 --> 03:05:09.352
LIAM: Are you bullshitting me now?

03:05:09.352 --> 03:05:10.668
MATT: "No!"

03:05:10.668 --> 03:05:12.365
LIAM: I'm looking in his cart.

03:05:12.365 --> 03:05:14.569
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

03:05:14.569 --> 03:05:19.920
MARISHA: As I'm laying in the grass with the guy
who I knocked unconscious, I'm going to pat down

03:05:19.920 --> 03:05:20.842
his body.

03:05:20.842 --> 03:05:22.309
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:23.475
LIAM: That's a 15.

03:05:23.475 --> 03:05:33.879
MARISHA: Natural 20 again! That's two 20s in a
row! Counter Wil Wheaton!

03:05:33.879 --> 03:05:43.663
MATT: First off, glancing inside and looking
through and rummaging and pulling, most of the

03:05:43.663 --> 03:05:50.019
cart stuff is gone. It has some simple grain bags
and things that were placed deliberately to look

03:05:50.019 --> 03:05:55.830
like it had a lot, and they shoved all of it
towards the exits of the two sides of the cover,

03:05:55.830 --> 03:06:02.656
but the interior of it is mostly empty. You see
two blankets. That's about it.

03:06:02.656 --> 03:06:06.474
LIAM: How's this working out for you?

03:06:06.474 --> 03:06:09.461
MATT: "Obviously not very well right now."

03:06:09.461 --> 03:06:12.709
LIAM: Are you better or worse than when you
started?

03:06:12.709 --> 03:06:19.736
MATT: "Look, this is embarrassing enough as it is.
It's hard enough to make ends meet. We're doing

03:06:19.736 --> 03:06:25.339
"what we need to to survive. We're happy to give
you this. We'll walk away, and pretend this never

03:06:25.339 --> 03:06:26.321
"happened."

03:06:26.321 --> 03:06:29.792
TALIESIN: I feel bad, I've got to admit. No, I
have to deal with this. I'm going to walk to my

03:06:29.792 --> 03:06:41.794
cart. I'm going to pull out that armor that I got
at the orc's place. I'm handing it to the kid.

03:06:41.794 --> 03:06:45.096
MATT: "What? I don't understand."

03:06:45.096 --> 03:06:48.243
TALIESIN: You're going to get shot at again. It's
breaking my heart.

03:06:48.243 --> 03:06:52.376
TRAVIS: You really can't find a safer line of
work?

03:06:52.376 --> 03:06:59.640
LIAM: Yeah, head to the cities. Work on a dock.
Learn from your mistakes. What the fuck are you doing?

03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:02.192
TRAVIS: What are you doing with your lives?

03:07:02.192 --> 03:07:06.796
MATT: He grabs the armor and tucks it in. "Thank
you."

03:07:06.796 --> 03:07:12.405
TALIESIN: Thank you for recognizing and for being
gracious about our previous deal. I appreciate

03:07:12.405 --> 03:07:15.724
someone who stands up and holds to their word.
That's really nice, and that should be rewarded in

03:07:15.724 --> 03:07:16.768
this world.

03:07:16.768 --> 03:07:18.422
LIAM: Three strikes and you're out. This is two.

03:07:18.422 --> 03:07:20.465
MATT: "Right, no. Yeah."

03:07:20.465 --> 03:07:24.983
LAURA: They said they wouldn't be bandits anymore,
but they are bandits.

03:07:24.983 --> 03:07:26.573
TALIESIN: Well, I wasn't really holding them to
that one.

03:07:26.573 --> 03:07:32.584
LIAM: That's fine. The next time, we are going to
turn you into grease puddles, so maybe find

03:07:32.584 --> 03:07:36.066
yourselves a job in a store, or a dock, or a
restaurant, even.

03:07:36.066 --> 03:07:40.240
LAURA: Yeah, don't go working for criminals!
That's stupid!

03:07:40.240 --> 03:07:42.783
LIAM: At least be good at it if you're going to do
that.

03:07:42.783 --> 03:07:45.282
TRAVIS: I think they're freelance, Jester. They
work for themselves.

03:07:45.282 --> 03:07:50.400
LAURA: Oh. Then if you're going to do bad things,
at least work for somebody who's rich and doing

03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:54.528
bad things! Don't just steal from people on the
road, that's stupid!

03:07:54.528 --> 03:07:59.673
MATT: Two of the guys go like, "Yeah, no, she's
got a point." "I know!"

03:07:59.673 --> 03:08:05.111
LIAM: I walk up to this guy, and I take the stone
out of my pocket and I place it against his

03:08:05.111 --> 03:08:13.938
forehead, and I mutter a few words under my
breath. And now I know where you are at all times,

03:08:13.938 --> 03:08:19.669
and I will know if you are still doing this kind
of work, and I will come and I will kill you.

03:08:19.669 --> 03:08:21.815
MATT: Make a deception check with advantage.

03:08:21.815 --> 03:08:26.212
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:08:26.212 --> 03:08:31.849
MARISHA: Over here is our safe haven from that.

03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:38.993
MATT: He's nodding. You can see the sweat on his
brow, and you can't help but notice the darkening

03:08:38.993 --> 03:08:46.020
spot in his nether regions. "Of course, no
worries, sir, I promise, no worries. We'll go and

03:08:46.020 --> 03:08:54.836
"we'll slop pigs. We'll do what it takes, anything
but this. Right, boys?" They're like, "The fuck?

03:08:54.836 --> 03:08:56.100
"You pissed yourself."

03:08:56.100 --> 03:08:58.990
TALIESIN: Respect management.

03:08:58.990 --> 03:09:11.184
MATT: "Yeah." They pick up their crossbows and
tuck them under their arms. "Good night. Safe travels."

03:09:11.184 --> 03:09:13.182
LAURA: Only steal from grumpy people!

03:09:13.182 --> 03:09:14.724
TALIESIN: So true.

03:09:14.724 --> 03:09:24.182
MATT: "Good night." The guy next to you, as you're
patting him down, two things. One, you manage to

03:09:24.182 --> 03:09:30.066
get about seven silver from him. That's all the
money he has on him at the moment.

03:09:30.066 --> 03:09:32.260
MARISHA: (singing) Hey, big spender!

03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:39.164
MATT: You find a hard spot on the side of his
stomach that he should probably get checked out.

03:09:39.164 --> 03:09:42.719
TALIESIN: Oh god, why?

03:09:42.719 --> 03:09:46.561
MATT: Because he doesn't have anything else, but
she rolled a 20 investigation check! I didn't know

03:09:46.561 --> 03:09:47.423
what else!

03:09:47.423 --> 03:09:48.554
LIAM: Oh my god!

03:09:48.554 --> 03:09:54.084
LAURA: You're going to steal his money and he's
got medical problems.

03:09:54.084 --> 03:09:55.453
LIAM: No, he's a warlock.

03:09:55.453 --> 03:10:02.461
MARISHA: As they all leave, Beau peeks her head
out of the grass and goes: I knocked one

03:10:02.461 --> 03:10:08.471
unconscious, and I don't know what to do with him
now. I could've let him go, but I didn't want to

03:10:08.471 --> 03:10:12.027
say anything in front of everybody because I
started feeling bad once you guys felt bad.

03:10:12.027 --> 03:10:13.464
LAURA: Do I have to heal him now?

03:10:13.464 --> 03:10:18.365
TRAVIS: You're probably doing him a favor, all
right? He'll wake up in the morning. No one will

03:10:18.422 --> 03:10:21.186
be here. He'll start his life, it'll be a new
chapter. It'll be fine.

03:10:21.186 --> 03:10:24.168
LIAM: No, they're going to leave him. We've got
one more of your-- This one, take him!

03:10:24.168 --> 03:10:28.728
MATT: At this point, there's a sound behind you, a
(huffing). You see Kiri running with her knife,

03:10:28.728 --> 03:10:30.679
going, (like Cali) "I kill people!"

03:10:30.679 --> 03:10:34.541
LAURA: Don't kill this corpse! Don't stab this
corpse!

03:10:34.541 --> 03:10:37.978
TALIESIN: It's not technically a corpse yet.

03:10:37.978 --> 03:10:39.760
LAURA: I know, but she'll think it is.

03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:43.976
SAM: Maybe they can take Kiri.

03:10:43.976 --> 03:10:45.514
LAURA: No way!

03:10:45.514 --> 03:10:47.259
SAM: I don't know, we need to get rid of Kiri!

03:10:47.259 --> 03:10:52.252
LAURA: That's so terrible!

03:10:52.252 --> 03:10:55.459
TRAVIS: Give her a life of adventure and imminent
death.

03:10:55.459 --> 03:11:03.885
MARISHA: I take this guy's green mask, and his
pants, and I give his pants to Jester.

03:11:03.885 --> 03:11:06.473
MATT: There you go. Write that down in your
equipment.

03:11:06.473 --> 03:11:07.728
LAURA: I got pants!

03:11:07.728 --> 03:11:08.633
MATT: Bandit pants!

03:11:08.633 --> 03:11:12.286
LAURA: I'm going to add it because I think I
already have some bandit pants.

03:11:12.286 --> 03:11:15.704
MATT: There you go. He starts to come to
consciousness.

03:11:15.704 --> 03:11:20.028
MARISHA: Oh no! (thud) Oh, fuck! Sorry, it was a
reflex!

03:11:20.028 --> 03:11:23.411
TRAVIS: Lay him in the grass.

03:11:23.411 --> 03:11:28.829
MATT: His friends have all run off northward.

03:11:28.829 --> 03:11:30.809
MARISHA: Your friend is-- They're bad friends.

03:11:30.809 --> 03:11:32.686
TRAVIS: He gets a fresh start in the morning.
It'll be fine.

03:11:32.686 --> 03:11:34.099
TALIESIN: He'll only find better people.

03:11:34.099 --> 03:11:38.730
MARISHA: Okay. I try to lay him down gently.

03:11:38.730 --> 03:11:42.503
MATT: He's drooling down himself.

03:11:42.503 --> 03:11:44.449
MARISHA: I turn him on his side.

03:11:44.449 --> 03:11:46.116
TRAVIS: Does he have any coin on him at all?

03:11:46.116 --> 03:11:49.678
MARISHA: I already took seven silver. These guys
sucked.

03:11:49.678 --> 03:11:51.393
TRAVIS: Here, I put two gold in his pocket.

03:11:51.393 --> 03:11:55.245
LIAM: Judging by the map, how far are we from any
town?

03:11:55.245 --> 03:11:58.432
MATT: You guys are about here.

03:11:58.432 --> 03:12:00.020
LIAM: Oh, this guy's going to die.

03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:06.577
MATT: Yeah, you're about 24 miles away from the
crossroads.

03:12:06.577 --> 03:12:08.335
LIAM: How far away are his friends?

03:12:08.335 --> 03:12:11.939
MATT: You don't see them at the moment.

03:12:11.939 --> 03:12:14.292
LAURA: He knows where their hideout is, he's
fine.

03:12:14.292 --> 03:12:19.370
LIAM: I'm going to pull my wire out, and Message
the one who I intimidated and say: you left one

03:12:19.370 --> 03:12:20.477
behind, he's here.

03:12:20.477 --> 03:12:21.466
MATT: What's the range on that?

03:12:21.466 --> 03:12:25.995
LIAM: It's 120 feet, I think. I'm going to check
it out. It's 5,000 feet.

03:12:25.995 --> 03:12:28.268
LAURA: He'll be fine, he's a bandit.

03:12:28.268 --> 03:12:30.923
LIAM: I just talked into a wire, you don't know.
It's fine.

03:12:30.923 --> 03:12:35.446
TALIESIN: That went well.

03:12:35.446 --> 03:12:42.992
MARISHA: Hey, Jester. What if we take him and we
pose him, and we put a drawing around him just in

03:12:42.992 --> 03:12:50.759
case anybody else finds him, and maybe they think
there's something wrong with this guy? A sign? I

03:12:50.759 --> 03:12:51.877
don't know.

03:12:51.877 --> 03:12:55.795
LIAM: The good news is, we're in the middle of the
wilderness and no one is going to find him.

03:12:55.795 --> 03:12:59.575
MARISHA: I was trying to be jovial, I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have tried that.

03:12:59.575 --> 03:13:04.270
LAURA: What if we put some flowers in his hair, so
when he wakes up, he looks really pretty?

03:13:04.270 --> 03:13:05.860
MARISHA: That's good. Let's do that.

03:13:05.860 --> 03:13:09.121
TALIESIN: There's nothing better than waking up in
the morning with no pants and flowers in your hair.

03:13:09.121 --> 03:13:17.089
LIAM: I have a dagger, and I'm going to shove it
in his belt so he's not totally alone. He's

03:13:17.089 --> 03:13:18.896
pantsless, but with a dagger, correct?

03:13:18.896 --> 03:13:24.880
MATT: Pantsless with a crossbow, and a simple
shortsword that's tucked off to his side.

03:13:24.880 --> 03:13:28.723
LIAM: Oh, I didn't see that. I take my dagger
back. He's fine, he's got a blade.

03:13:28.723 --> 03:13:42.080
MATT: His hair is filled with flowers, he's on his
side, flopping away from the sky. The cart's there

03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:43.319
if there's anything you need to grab from it.

03:13:43.319 --> 03:13:44.742
TALIESIN: I add a drop of lavender oil and I think
we're done.

03:13:44.742 --> 03:13:45.952
MATT: There you go.

03:13:45.952 --> 03:13:48.717
SAM: Was there anything in the cart? No, right?

03:13:48.717 --> 03:13:50.427
LAURA: There's blankets. We can take the
blankets.

03:13:50.427 --> 03:13:53.288
MATT: There's a couple blankets, there's grain,
and it has a cover on it.

03:13:53.288 --> 03:13:55.995
TALIESIN: And this is why you buy the lavender
oil.

03:13:55.995 --> 03:13:57.600
LAURA: Molly, they have a covered wagon!

03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:02.467
TALIESIN: So we can remove it and attach it to
ours?

03:14:02.467 --> 03:14:04.627
LAURA: Or we can take theirs and leave ours.

03:14:04.627 --> 03:14:06.074
TALIESIN: Is theirs better than ours?

03:14:06.074 --> 03:14:10.628
MATT: The cart is comparable, probably a little
more weathered than the one you guys have.

03:14:10.628 --> 03:14:15.307
LIAM: This is so dumb. What color is it?

03:14:15.307 --> 03:14:20.411
MATT: It's a basic canvas. It's a tan.

03:14:20.411 --> 03:14:21.880
LIAM: It is Oregon Trail.

03:14:21.880 --> 03:14:24.383
TALIESIN: It's all about the dysentery.

03:14:24.383 --> 03:14:27.256
MATT: It's a tan, light brown.

03:14:27.256 --> 03:14:31.261
MARISHA: It's a Florida convertible.

03:14:31.261 --> 03:14:32.263
MATT: Yeah.

03:14:32.263 --> 03:14:35.436
TALIESIN: The Volvo of wagons.

03:14:35.436 --> 03:14:42.257
MATT: Essentially. Ironic that you went looking to
build that and it was already in the possible

03:14:42.257 --> 03:14:46.995
path. All right. So you guys pull that off.

03:14:46.995 --> 03:14:48.758
ASHLEY: Take the blankets.

03:14:48.758 --> 03:14:53.870
MATT: Take the blankets. Make your way back to
your cart. Finish up your evening's rest, and at

03:14:53.870 --> 03:14:59.286
morning light, continue your way northward along
the road. All righty.

03:14:59.286 --> 03:15:01.250
TALIESIN: (clopping sounds)

03:15:01.250 --> 03:15:03.069
TRAVIS: That's some tiny-ass hooves.

03:15:03.069 --> 03:15:06.543
MATT: For the sake of brevity, since we're getting
towards the end of the evening--

03:15:06.543 --> 03:15:07.957
LAURA: We should take the grain for our horses.

03:15:07.957 --> 03:15:11.687
SAM: Horses eat grass.

03:15:11.687 --> 03:15:12.695
LIAM: Let's count the grains.

03:15:12.695 --> 03:15:14.463
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Let's travel north, for fuck's
sake!

03:15:14.463 --> 03:15:22.524
MATT: The next two days go on without issue.
Passing a few travelers heading southward,

03:15:22.524 --> 03:15:32.895
crossing your way, until eventually, the
Silberquel Ridge grows more and more prominent in

03:15:32.895 --> 03:15:38.456
your line of sight. Following the path, the fields
that surround the north road begin to give way to

03:15:38.456 --> 03:15:45.449
tall grass and trade for scrub land and rocks, the
once-vanishing shape of the Silberquel Ridge

03:15:45.449 --> 03:15:51.368
mountains growing bigger and bigger, the numerous
columns of mingling black-and-white smoke you can

03:15:51.368 --> 03:15:57.693
now see spill from the eastern side of the
mountain, diffusing as they rise. As you travel

03:15:57.693 --> 03:16:04.852
even closer, you can make out the two-tiered
layout of a city built into the mountain. One

03:16:04.852 --> 03:16:10.644
large region encircles the very base of the
mountain, ahundred or more dark workshops and

03:16:10.644 --> 03:16:16.752
towers, billowing smoke from chimneys and stacks
visible. A number of large constructions dot the

03:16:16.752 --> 03:16:26.413
open spaces between these towers, some oversized
cannons or others like mobile siege towers. One

03:16:26.413 --> 03:16:31.390
resembles a wheeled, multi-tiered cart with
numerous, wicked-looking bolt-throwers attached.

03:16:31.390 --> 03:16:38.797
As you begin to head in this direction, you can
also see that this lower area, this industrial

03:16:38.797 --> 03:16:44.482
field of various engines of warfare that are in
the process of being constructed, some in their

03:16:44.482 --> 03:16:52.703
skeletal phase of being built. To the base of the
mountain above that, you can see two winding

03:16:52.703 --> 03:16:59.455
switchback roads as well as one very steep
staircase that ascends to a second level, about a

03:16:59.455 --> 03:17:09.037
hundred or more feet above the first. Here you see
a massive outcropping of leveled rock that holds

03:17:09.037 --> 03:17:15.358
the other half of the city. There along the ridge
of the mountain shelf lies hundreds of buildings

03:17:15.358 --> 03:17:22.117
and arches, occasionally dappled with an
autumn-colored tree. Behind this city mass, you

03:17:22.117 --> 03:17:27.464
see a shimmering waterfall that cascades from out
of the center of the mountain, about 1000 feet up,

03:17:27.464 --> 03:17:32.467
that glimmers like silver-white light and the
little bit of sun that's coming through the

03:17:32.467 --> 03:17:38.140
clouds. You've reached the outskirts of
Hupperdook.

03:17:38.140 --> 03:17:41.309
LAURA: This is not how I pictured it.

03:17:41.309 --> 03:17:43.074
TALIESIN: I like it.

03:17:43.074 --> 03:17:44.987
MARISHA: I told you it's a city of industry.

03:17:44.987 --> 03:17:49.779
TALIESIN: I like a good waterfall.

03:17:49.779 --> 03:17:56.842
SAM: Where are the EDM gnomes?

03:17:56.842 --> 03:17:58.693
MARISHA: Well, that happens at nightfall.

03:17:58.693 --> 03:18:02.354
LAURA: Is it mostly gnomes that live in the city?

03:18:02.354 --> 03:18:07.670
MARISHA: I think mostly gnomes, but I'm pretty
sure there are other people. I don't know. I've

03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:09.266
never been here. I've only heard stories.

03:18:09.266 --> 03:18:10.822
LAURA: Does it look like the buildings are teeny?

03:18:10.822 --> 03:18:14.673
MATT: From best you can tell from this
perspective, make a perception check.

03:18:14.673 --> 03:18:20.529
LAURA: 13.

03:18:20.529 --> 03:18:28.740
MATT: It's hard to tell. The buildings that are in
the outside of the upper ridge look to be varying

03:18:28.805 --> 03:18:34.284
sizes. They don't appear to be super tiny, by any
means. You do see from this perspective, as you're

03:18:34.284 --> 03:18:39.434
heading down to the base of the mountain, you're
at the top of the hill, and this last leg as you

03:18:39.434 --> 03:18:46.453
start pushing in towards Hupperdook, at the base
of where the waterfall is hitting, behind that

03:18:46.453 --> 03:18:52.640
row, you can see what look to be numerous towers,
thin and tall, like these weird needles of

03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:56.288
buildings that kind of cluster around the base of
the waterfall. That's as much as you can make out

03:18:56.288 --> 03:18:57.381
at this distance.

03:18:57.381 --> 03:19:02.203
LIAM: On a scale of one to ten, one being like a
shit-ass swamp town and ten being like Rexxentrum,

03:19:02.203 --> 03:19:05.889
what does the civilization of this city look
like?

03:19:05.889 --> 03:19:13.216
MATT: The technology, as you get closer and closer
and begin seeing these fields of construction, the

03:19:13.280 --> 03:19:21.431
industry is pretty prominent. It's the most you've
ever seen. As far as the beauty of a living,

03:19:21.431 --> 03:19:24.566
civilized town, five or six, maybe?

03:19:24.566 --> 03:19:25.679
LIAM: But not podunk?

03:19:25.679 --> 03:19:27.256
MATT: It's not podunk, by any means.

03:19:27.256 --> 03:19:28.098
LIAM: It's builded?

03:19:28.098 --> 03:19:31.804
MATT: Yeah. It's well-built. It seems
comfortable.

03:19:31.804 --> 03:19:38.404
The base area around the mountain as you
begin to approach-- and you can see now where the

03:19:38.464 --> 03:19:45.622
clouds and bits of steam are mingling and rising
up, mixing into the sky above you-- the colors here

03:19:45.622 --> 03:19:53.415
are fairly drab: browns, grays, dark graphite
metals. And immediately, you can see the ground

03:19:53.415 --> 03:19:54.413
itself.

03:19:54.413 --> 03:19:57.208
SAM: (coughs) That's good water.

03:19:57.208 --> 03:20:08.972
MATT: You can see the ground itself as you step in
the area has a faint layer of soot where some of

03:20:08.996 --> 03:20:14.553
the burned materials that are pressed up into the
air have come down to settle onto the ground

03:20:14.553 --> 03:20:18.842
surrounding it. What do you wish to do?

03:20:18.842 --> 03:20:20.267
MARISHA: What time of day is it?

03:20:20.267 --> 03:20:22.555
MATT: It's mid-afternoon.

03:20:22.555 --> 03:20:26.382
LAURA: (quietly) We should be going to the city.

03:20:26.382 --> 03:20:27.458
MARISHA: (quietly) I think so.

03:20:27.458 --> 03:20:29.413
LAURA: I guess we'll ride into the city.

03:20:29.413 --> 03:20:31.456
TALIESIN: I'd like sleep somewhere comfortable.

03:20:31.456 --> 03:20:38.363
MATT: Following the path, there is a large
metallic archway that rises into a pointed

03:20:38.363 --> 03:20:46.463
entrance where, as you enter, you can see, in the
metal carved in various rivets, "HUPPER," "DOOK"

03:20:46.463 --> 03:20:52.073
on the other side. There, you see two townsguards
standing there, both human, standing guard. And as

03:20:52.073 --> 03:20:57.254
you approach, one of them steps forward. "Welcome.
What is your business?"

03:20:57.254 --> 03:21:01.501
TRAVIS: Looking for lodging for the evening. We've
been on the road for some time.

03:21:01.501 --> 03:21:08.933
MATT: "Understood. You would probably want to go
ahead and head up the mountain for that. Down here

03:21:08.933 --> 03:21:10.174
"is all industry."

03:21:10.174 --> 03:21:16.847
TRAVIS: All industry? Where would we be looking
for further up the mountain?

03:21:16.847 --> 03:21:21.715
MATT: He points out, "This is the Iron Lot and the
Assembly Yard. You're going to want to head up to

03:21:21.715 --> 03:21:23.597
"the Idleworks Shelf to find lodging."

03:21:23.597 --> 03:21:25.711
TALIESIN: Idleworks Shelf.

03:21:25.711 --> 03:21:27.046
MATT: "Idleworks Shelf, yes."

03:21:27.046 --> 03:21:31.250
TRAVIS: Any recommendations? Favorite spots?

03:21:31.250 --> 03:21:39.625
MATT: "The most prominent and most lively would
probably be the Blushing Tankard tavern."

03:21:39.625 --> 03:21:44.755
MARISHA: I do like alliteracy.

03:21:44.755 --> 03:21:48.001
LAURA: Blushing Tankard tavern.

03:21:48.001 --> 03:21:49.527
TRAVIS: I-i-illiteracy?

03:21:49.527 --> 03:21:51.176
MARISHA: Alliteracy.

03:21:51.176 --> 03:21:52.283
LAURA: Alliteration.

03:21:52.283 --> 03:21:53.454
LIAM: Illiteracy.

03:21:53.454 --> 03:21:59.298
TRAVIS: Not often you find people a fan of
illiteracy, but--

03:21:59.298 --> 03:22:01.879
MARISHA: I like unlearnt folks.

03:22:01.879 --> 03:22:06.263
TRAVIS: Well, we appreciate it. We'll head on up.

03:22:06.263 --> 03:22:12.201
MATT: He steps back to his post, and just keeps an
eye as you guys enter in the midsection. At this

03:22:12.201 --> 03:22:20.112
point, you begin to hear the actual industry here.
There's this faint buzzing and clicking sound as

03:22:20.112 --> 03:22:25.185
you see some of these large wheels that are
affixed to the outside of these large towers are

03:22:25.185 --> 03:22:33.468
grinding. You can see platforms rising up with the
gears turning. And on them, you can see numerous

03:22:33.468 --> 03:22:39.176
gnomes, male and female, in the process of what
looks to be building materials lifted onto higher

03:22:39.176 --> 03:22:42.455
levels. You could see some of these war machines
that are being developed and designed here,

03:22:42.455 --> 03:22:47.373
mid-construction. You get the sense that with the
call of war, they're probably put into high gear

03:22:47.373 --> 03:22:53.115
in developing whatever siege weapons they can
possibly muster in the short time frame. And the

03:22:53.115 --> 03:22:54.223
furnaces are going well.

03:22:54.223 --> 03:22:59.180
MARISHA: And when you say "war machines," how do
you mean?

03:22:59.180 --> 03:23:06.311
MATT: From what you can see, from the distance,
you can see they have some larger-wheeled

03:23:06.311 --> 03:23:13.455
platforms that have bolt-throwers, which are
large-- imagine a crossbow but on a massive

03:23:13.455 --> 03:23:20.455
scale. The giant metallic spear that gets flung
from it at a really, really powerful speed. You

03:23:20.455 --> 03:23:26.100
see three or four affixed to a single platform.
You're not sure what animal would be able to pull

03:23:26.100 --> 03:23:33.775
that. You also see siege towers, 30 feet tall,
wheeled, with a number of ladders and platforms

03:23:33.775 --> 03:23:42.495
inside that are used to clamor up against
fortresses. You see one that looks almost like a

03:23:42.495 --> 03:23:49.326
giant battering ram that is in the process of
being constructed. The interior metal rod is

03:23:49.326 --> 03:23:54.035
currently resting on the ground next to it and
they're building an outer frame. Looking past, on

03:23:54.035 --> 03:24:04.344
the far end-- on the northern end, you can see a
huge cannon, maybe about 15 feet across and about

03:24:04.344 --> 03:24:11.817
three to four feet wide in the middle. That one is
on a platform. The wheels are currently resting in

03:24:11.817 --> 03:24:19.414
the side and they're in the process of finishing
the construction of the device. Make a perception check.

03:24:19.414 --> 03:24:22.136
SAM: Yes!

03:24:22.136 --> 03:24:26.619
MARISHA: 14.

03:24:26.619 --> 03:24:30.774
MATT: Okay. Just beyond that, on the northern
side, as you guys are riding past, and you kind of

03:24:30.774 --> 03:24:39.899
get as much height as you can, beyond these towers
and what was referred to earlier as the Assembly

03:24:39.899 --> 03:24:44.990
Yard, which is the area where all these war
machines are being built, you can see a roped

03:24:44.990 --> 03:24:52.290
section that is just pock-marked craters and
scarred ground, what you assume to be some sort of

03:24:52.290 --> 03:24:59.597
a testing ground for whatever they've been working
on over the numerous decades or more they've been

03:24:59.597 --> 03:25:04.558
here. You're not sure-- actually, roll a history
check, because I'm curious to see how much you

03:25:04.558 --> 03:25:05.660
know about this.

03:25:05.660 --> 03:25:06.938
MARISHA: (sing-songy) Don't fuck me, Gil.

03:25:06.938 --> 03:25:07.889
SAM: Yes!

03:25:07.889 --> 03:25:08.887
LIAM: He did it.

03:25:08.887 --> 03:25:21.126
MARISHA: Fucked me pretty hard. That's three. Can
I use my mystical erudition to get an advantage

03:25:21.126 --> 03:25:22.474
on history checks?

03:25:22.474 --> 03:25:27.194
MATT: I'll allow it this time, but usually, you
have to decide that before you make the roll. It's

03:25:27.194 --> 03:25:28.244
not a lucky feat, so.

03:25:28.244 --> 03:25:29.792
MARISHA: Deciding it now.

03:25:29.792 --> 03:25:30.840
MATT: But going forward--

03:25:30.840 --> 03:25:33.142
MARISHA and LIAM: Not much better.

03:25:33.142 --> 03:25:38.163
MARISHA: At all. Nine.

03:25:38.163 --> 03:25:42.967
MATT: Okay. You haven't learned that much about
the history of Hupperdook. You know it's been here

03:25:42.967 --> 03:25:44.384
for a while.

03:25:44.384 --> 03:25:47.464
MARISHA: This scarred pot-marked line?

03:25:47.464 --> 03:25:52.809
MATT: This city. It's been here for quite some
time, so while you're not sure of how long that

03:25:52.886 --> 03:25:58.463
field has been there, you get the sense that this
isn't a recent testing ground. It probably has

03:25:58.463 --> 03:26:01.323
been their general testing ground for any
technology they're developing.

03:26:01.323 --> 03:26:04.739
MARISHA: Okay. So it's not new. Okay.

03:26:04.739 --> 03:26:09.940
MATT: Glancing about, you see more crownsguard
attire, though now you're starting to get to more

03:26:09.940 --> 03:26:17.826
gnomish crownsguard who are established there. And
on their backs, as opposed to spears or shields at

03:26:17.826 --> 03:26:24.169
the ready, you see similar weapons to what some of
the army moving eastward were carrying. You see

03:26:24.169 --> 03:26:33.595
long metal rods affixed with a wooden buttress at
the end. These strange firearms that have been

03:26:33.595 --> 03:26:39.203
carefully relegated to certain individuals here
are a little more in use here.

03:26:39.203 --> 03:26:43.373
SAM: Are there any platform shoes, glowsticks, or
pacifiers?

03:26:43.373 --> 03:26:44.848
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:26:44.848 --> 03:26:47.363
SAM: All right. 13.

03:26:47.363 --> 03:26:48.410
MATT: Not yet.

03:26:48.410 --> 03:26:56.330
ASHLEY: Are there any flowers that are even
visible at this area?

03:26:56.330 --> 03:26:57.907
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:26:57.907 --> 03:27:00.501
TALIESIN: Pink hearts, yellow moons.

03:27:00.501 --> 03:27:01.531
ASHLEY: Perception check?

03:27:01.531 --> 03:27:02.629
MATT: Purple horseshoes--

03:27:02.629 --> 03:27:04.006
TALIESIN: Blue diamonds?

03:27:04.006 --> 03:27:06.150
MATT: Red balloons.

03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:07.337
ASHLEY: 18.

03:27:07.337 --> 03:27:12.444
MATT: As you guys are clopping along, you look
down and most of the land here is fairly barren.

03:27:12.444 --> 03:27:17.416
The outskirts of this, whether it be just the
heavy amount of smoke and soot that's put out by

03:27:17.416 --> 03:27:22.247
the industry, there isn't a lot of grass. What is
here is pretty harsh scrubland. You glance down,

03:27:22.247 --> 03:27:27.919
though, and one of the small bushes does have a
very unique-looking white bud. They haven't opened

03:27:27.919 --> 03:27:33.344
yet, but they're beautiful amongst this stark
ground. And you could reach down, if you wanted to.

03:27:33.344 --> 03:27:36.211
ASHLEY: I reach down and I take it and put it in
my book.

03:27:36.211 --> 03:27:38.047
MATT: You grab, pluck a couple of them and put
them in your book. Okay.

03:27:38.047 --> 03:27:41.390
TALIESIN: There'll probably be something siding
closer to the waterfall, maybe.

03:27:41.390 --> 03:27:42.858
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'll get more.

03:27:42.858 --> 03:27:44.425
TRAVIS: Are the guards still within earshot?

03:27:44.425 --> 03:27:47.387
MATT: The ones you talked to earlier? No. You
moved on from them, but there are other

03:27:47.387 --> 03:27:53.633
crownsguard in the area. You can hear the heavy
sounds of metal clanging and the occasional sparks

03:27:53.633 --> 03:27:58.781
in the distance of some sort of welding process being
done on some of the distant towers. You can see,

03:27:58.781 --> 03:28:05.338
on the opposite side of the southern side, dozens
and dozens of dark metallic warehouses and

03:28:05.338 --> 03:28:11.166
buildings that are junctured by hallways. There
are small compounds that are focused on whatever

03:28:11.166 --> 03:28:19.747
their specific businesses are in these designated,
delegated areas. It's weirdly almost drab and

03:28:19.747 --> 03:28:25.061
dystopian in a visual perspective. When you come
to the base of the mountain here, where you see

03:28:25.061 --> 03:28:32.705
that large, very steep staircase you were looking
at, there are the switchback pathways up there.

03:28:32.705 --> 03:28:39.359
But as you approach, you hear this (thud). And
looking up, you can see these chains, these big,

03:28:39.359 --> 03:28:49.060
heavy, dark chains that are shifting. And as it
does, you can see this platform begin to lower

03:28:49.060 --> 03:28:54.404
from the city above, heading in your direction. In
front of you, at the base of the mountain, you can

03:28:54.404 --> 03:28:58.892
see there are a few other individuals that are
sitting there, waiting patiently. You can see this

03:28:58.892 --> 03:29:03.887
platform eventually comes down, seems to be one of
many means to make your way to the second part of

03:29:03.887 --> 03:29:05.036
the city.

03:29:05.036 --> 03:29:06.323
SAM: Will our whole cart fit on it?

03:29:06.323 --> 03:29:07.592
MATT: It's a lift.

03:29:07.592 --> 03:29:09.004
LAURA: Hold the elevator.

03:29:09.004 --> 03:29:11.475
TALIESIN: Does that seems safe to you?

03:29:11.475 --> 03:29:12.702
SAM: Do we have to pay for it?

03:29:12.702 --> 03:29:13.760
LAURA: It will be fun.

03:29:13.760 --> 03:29:21.036
MATT: All right. As you approach, you see there
are four crownsguard, one dwarven, three gnomish,

03:29:21.036 --> 03:29:26.077
that are there waiting it. You see the few figures
that were waiting patiently. They appear to be

03:29:26.077 --> 03:29:35.012
well-dressed, human, one half-elf, wearing what
looks to be reds and gold velvets. They look

03:29:35.012 --> 03:29:44.708
to be relatively well-off, standing definitely out
of place in this rather dark space. They step onto

03:29:44.708 --> 03:29:50.003
the lift, and as you approach, the guards put
their hands out. "I'm sorry, who are you?"

03:29:50.003 --> 03:29:53.211
LAURA: We are guests here.

03:29:53.211 --> 03:29:55.601
TALIESIN: Looking for lodgings for the night.

03:29:55.601 --> 03:30:01.055
MATT: "Lodgings? Well, you'll have to take the
path upward. This is designated for guests of

03:30:01.055 --> 03:30:02.398
"Hupperdook."

03:30:02.398 --> 03:30:04.673
LAURA: That's what we are. We're guests of
Hupperdook.

03:30:04.673 --> 03:30:05.828
MATT: "Guests of whom?"

03:30:05.828 --> 03:30:06.846
LAURA: Hupperdook.

03:30:06.846 --> 03:30:11.922
TRAVIS: Guests of Ophelia Mardun.

03:30:11.922 --> 03:30:14.809
LAURA: Yes. That one.

03:30:14.809 --> 03:30:19.439
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:30:19.439 --> 03:30:28.769
TRAVIS: 16.

03:30:28.769 --> 03:30:34.222
MATT: "I'm sorry, I don't recognize the name.
You'll have to take the path."

03:30:34.222 --> 03:30:37.889
TRAVIS: That's not our fault. She's very
important. I would hate to keep us out of her good

03:30:37.889 --> 03:30:43.241
graces. I feel like the pull she has in this city
should be more than enough to allow us to use the lift.

03:30:43.241 --> 03:30:48.447
MATT: "I guarantee you, sir, I've never heard the
name before in my life. But there is always the path."

03:30:48.447 --> 03:30:54.106
TRAVIS: Well, you'll know her name after today. I
guarantee you that. I hope you enjoy this post.

03:30:54.106 --> 03:30:55.939
For the rest of your evening.

03:30:55.939 --> 03:31:03.872
MATT: "Of course." He takes a small pistol out
from his side and aims it in the air and it fires

03:31:03.937 --> 03:31:08.658
with a puff of smoke, and the chains begin to
lift.

03:31:08.658 --> 03:31:12.886
LAURA: Oh, man. Come on, I really want to be on
it! Come on, man. Let us get on, man.

03:31:12.886 --> 03:31:16.254
TALIESIN: I don't need that ride.

03:31:16.254 --> 03:31:19.403
SAM: What the hell was that thing he shot in the
sky?

03:31:19.403 --> 03:31:22.814
LAURA: It was a firecracker, that's all.

03:31:22.814 --> 03:31:32.068
MATT: As you guys are frustratingly fuming over
that not-quite-as-positive experience, a voice

03:31:32.068 --> 03:31:42.192
from around behind you goes, "Well, now. You look
like you're not from around here. Is that true?"

03:31:42.192 --> 03:31:53.693
You turn and glance behind you and you can see,
through a surly grin and a curly mop of

03:31:53.693 --> 03:32:02.125
brownish-red hair, a female gnome in her young
adult years wearing simple clothes, some leather

03:32:02.125 --> 03:32:09.457
gloves. She has dangling around her neck a set of
eye protectors. She's rubbing a little bit of soot

03:32:09.457 --> 03:32:14.949
from her chin. "So. You couldn't take the lift."

03:32:14.949 --> 03:32:22.225
LAURA: Well, we could have, if this guy, he would
have listened to us, because we are really

03:32:22.225 --> 03:32:23.708
important people.

03:32:23.708 --> 03:32:26.387
MATT: "Are you?"

03:32:26.387 --> 03:32:28.426
TRAVIS: No, we're not.

03:32:28.426 --> 03:32:33.900
MATT: "See, that's going to get you far here.
Honesty."

03:32:33.900 --> 03:32:35.989
MARISHA: Self-deprecation? Oh, honesty.

03:32:35.989 --> 03:32:41.187
MATT: "Well, probably both, depending on the time
of day. So, who are you, if I might ask?"

03:32:41.187 --> 03:32:44.579
LAURA: We're the Mighty Nein.

03:32:44.579 --> 03:32:49.144
TALIESIN: Travelers passing through to somewhere
else.

03:32:49.144 --> 03:32:53.111
MATT: "So you're not from around here? I like
that. What brings you to Hupperdook?"

03:32:53.111 --> 03:32:55.389
LAURA: We thought the name was funny.

03:32:55.389 --> 03:32:57.954
SAM: That is accurate.

03:32:57.954 --> 03:33:04.267
MATT: Her brow furrows and a smile curls even
wider across her face. "You're not wrong. You're

03:33:04.267 --> 03:33:12.902
"not wrong. Well, I happen to be a local looking
for a way to kick off some boredom. Mind me

03:33:12.902 --> 03:33:14.313
"showing you around?"

03:33:14.313 --> 03:33:15.934
TRAVIS: I don't know. What's your name?

03:33:15.934 --> 03:33:20.370
MATT: "My name? Rissa. Pleasure to meet you,
Mr.--?"

03:33:20.370 --> 03:33:21.750
TRAVIS: Fjord.

03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:26.112
MATT: "Fjord. Mayhaps we be getting in some
trouble, too."

03:33:26.112 --> 03:33:31.270
MARISHA: I hear you people like to get in trouble
here at Hupperdook.

03:33:31.270 --> 03:33:32.420
LIAM: Especially at night.

03:33:32.420 --> 03:33:35.692
MATT: "We got about two hours."

03:33:35.692 --> 03:33:39.811
MARISHA: That's like 4:00. Wow. Amazing.

03:33:39.811 --> 03:33:42.843
MATT: Well, at this time, it'll probably be about
dusk.

03:33:42.843 --> 03:33:45.891
MARISHA: That's like 8:00. Crazy.

03:33:45.891 --> 03:33:52.732
TALIESIN: We need to find a place to store our
stuff and hopefully find an inn for the night, first.

03:33:52.732 --> 03:33:56.184
MATT: "There's a few inns to pick from. I can take
you around. Here, I'll lead you up the walkway.

03:33:56.184 --> 03:33:57.193
"Follow me."

03:33:57.193 --> 03:34:02.255
SAM: She's nice. Why? Let's kill her.

03:34:02.255 --> 03:34:04.581
MARISHA: Do we have this tourism look to us?

03:34:04.581 --> 03:34:05.996
SAM: For sure we do.

03:34:05.996 --> 03:34:09.649
LAURA: We might as well be wearing fanny packs.
All of us.

03:34:09.649 --> 03:34:13.737
MARISHA: We should get some fanny packs.

03:34:13.737 --> 03:34:17.778
LAURA: Like an amazing fanny haversack?

03:34:17.778 --> 03:34:23.226
MARISHA: Oh my god. You don't know what's in
there. Keep pulling stuff out.

03:34:23.226 --> 03:34:32.994
MATT: You guys begin to make your way up the
switchback path, up the mountainside towards the

03:34:32.994 --> 03:34:40.854
upper edge of the shelf. Along that way, your new
friend, Rissa, jumps up into the cart with you.

03:34:40.854 --> 03:34:44.947
She says, "I get the sense you don't know much
about us here."

03:34:44.947 --> 03:34:46.645
MARISHA: How much?

03:34:46.645 --> 03:34:53.560
MATT: "Oh, no charge. Or buy me a round, or five,
and we'll call it even."

03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:54.833
MARISHA: What do you want?

03:34:54.833 --> 03:34:58.550
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye on her, because I
think she's going to try to steal some of our stuff.

03:34:58.550 --> 03:35:02.335
MATT: Okay. "That's all I ask. Maybe help me fuck
with a friend or two."

03:35:02.335 --> 03:35:04.530
MARISHA: What?

03:35:04.530 --> 03:35:06.299
TRAVIS: Just say yes.

03:35:06.299 --> 03:35:07.373
SAM: She's just like us.

03:35:07.373 --> 03:35:09.015
TRAVIS: We're visitors here.

03:35:09.015 --> 03:35:13.296
MARISHA: She just asked to fuck with a friend.
Yes?

03:35:13.296 --> 03:35:17.588
LAURA: Beau, you make really bad first
impressions, too. She's basically you.

03:35:17.588 --> 03:35:18.728
MARISHA: That's true.

03:35:18.728 --> 03:35:23.233
MATT: She looks to Beau and is like, "Yeah."

03:35:23.233 --> 03:35:24.612
MARISHA: I nod back. Hmm, yeah.

03:35:24.612 --> 03:35:32.164
MATT: "Anyway, don't worry. I know the place is a
bit droll, but once the sun's down, it gets

03:35:32.164 --> 03:35:33.706
"interesting."

03:35:33.706 --> 03:35:42.717
LIAM: During all of that yammering on the way up,
I look over at Yasha and sigh out.

03:35:42.717 --> 03:35:50.693
ASHLEY: Yeah. A little crazy?

03:35:50.693 --> 03:35:55.228
LIAM: That's it.

03:35:55.228 --> 03:36:06.049
LAURA: Are you saying you are crazy? I mean, you
did that in front of everybody. Are we having an

03:36:06.049 --> 03:36:07.219
agreement?

03:36:07.219 --> 03:36:09.112
LIAM: (whispering) I am crazy.

03:36:09.112 --> 03:36:12.968
LAURA: Oh. I can see that about you.

03:36:12.968 --> 03:36:28.886
MATT: "Anyway, things are a bit busy around here.
They're busy most of the time. General workday

03:36:28.886 --> 03:36:36.889
"here is about ten to 12 hours. No weekends, no
breaks like the rest of you lazy and lackadaisical folk."

03:36:36.889 --> 03:36:38.696
TALIESIN: Private contractors.

03:36:38.696 --> 03:36:48.212
MATT: "Fair enough. Give you a quick tour of the
place, should give us right about time to get some drinks."

03:36:48.212 --> 03:36:50.427
TALIESIN: Drinks is a great idea.

03:36:50.427 --> 03:36:54.693
MATT: As you make your way up the mountain, making
small chatter, eventually you come to the

03:36:54.693 --> 03:37:00.353
outskirts of the Idleworks Shelf. Here,
encompassing the outer ring of this elevated shelf

03:37:00.353 --> 03:37:07.388
of the Silberquel Ridge, is a lively district of
taverns, inns, merchants, open pavilions that are

03:37:07.388 --> 03:37:14.197
currently empty. It looks like the place is pretty
much perpetually decorated for some sort of an

03:37:14.197 --> 03:37:21.822
event or a festival, but it's in disuse at the
moment. It is empty. Everyone you see in the

03:37:21.822 --> 03:37:26.913
street, there's nobody taking a walk. Everyone is
rushing from one place to another or shouting

03:37:26.913 --> 03:37:36.071
commands. There's a general air of busyness and
intent in each person you see. As you guys

03:37:36.071 --> 03:37:42.613
leisurely stroll through, every now and then you
get this side-eye of-- and they continue on past.

03:37:42.613 --> 03:37:50.089
A majority of the people here are gnomish.
Probably 80 percent of the people you see in the

03:37:50.089 --> 03:37:56.370
immediate vicinity at any point in time are of
gnomish heritage, only offset by the occasional

03:37:56.370 --> 03:38:01.575
dwarf and some human, half-elf. That's as much as
you've seen in your path here so far.

03:38:01.575 --> 03:38:07.926
LIAM: Do we, as a much taller United Colors of
Benetton pack, draw a lot of attention as we walk through?

03:38:07.926 --> 03:38:13.618
MATT: I mean, you do as you do. You are a very
colorful ensemble whenever you enter any sort of

03:38:13.618 --> 03:38:14.585
new establishment.

03:38:14.585 --> 03:38:16.372
TALIESIN: Have we seen another tiefling since
hitting the city?

03:38:16.372 --> 03:38:22.579
MATT: Not yet, no, but to be fair, most of the
streets are empty unless it's people going from

03:38:22.648 --> 03:38:29.420
business to business. It's an interesting feel.
It's almost like the town is a ghost town, where

03:38:29.420 --> 03:38:33.442
it's dead outside of those that are in the process
of making errands or doing runs.

03:38:33.442 --> 03:38:35.466
LAURA: Is it sooty up here too?

03:38:35.466 --> 03:38:44.110
MATT: A little bit, but not as bad as below. At
this point, your friend, Rissa, is pointing out in

03:38:44.178 --> 03:38:49.584
different directions and goes, "All right, then
that's over that way. This is the center of

03:38:49.584 --> 03:38:57.864
"Hupperdook culture here on the Shelf, where most
of the folks come to unwind. Beyond that you can

03:38:57.864 --> 03:39:04.864
"see what's called the Silver Falls, pointing over
there. That's the core of where most of the

03:39:04.864 --> 03:39:11.546
"residents live, sleep, make their families,
amongst the small towers you can see." And from

03:39:11.546 --> 03:39:15.341
this point you can now see those strange,
finger-like protrusions that were guarded around

03:39:15.341 --> 03:39:26.678
the waterfall are very condensed, thin, and tall
metallic towers that have balconies and little

03:39:26.678 --> 03:39:27.769
windows.

03:39:27.769 --> 03:39:31.773
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's a condo. It's a condo
complex.

03:39:31.773 --> 03:39:37.464
MATT: They're three stories, maybe four stories at
most. A lot of them look like they're off-kilter.

03:39:37.464 --> 03:39:47.835
It looks not safe, though they probably are. It's
a very unique living situation you haven't

03:39:47.835 --> 03:39:53.138
encountered with any other people in the Empire
and beyond. Glancing up, you can see there

03:39:53.138 --> 03:39:57.871
are a few folks that are out there in the process
of laying some rugs out and hanging them over the

03:39:57.871 --> 03:40:03.118
side. One woman up there is throwing some seeds to
some birds that float by and start eating off the

03:40:03.118 --> 03:40:05.030
edge there.

03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:10.065
LIAM: Rissa, you mentioned culture. Are there any
libraries here in Hupperdook?

03:40:10.065 --> 03:40:16.143
MATT: "I'm sure there is. Not anything I've
bothered with, though. Not much of a reader. My

03:40:16.143 --> 03:40:20.327
"father, well, he might know, but you don't want to
talk to him."

03:40:20.327 --> 03:40:22.220
MARISHA: Where do the best parties happen?

03:40:22.220 --> 03:40:24.724
MATT: "Just wait. Be patient. Be patient."

03:40:24.724 --> 03:40:27.702
LAURA: Do you live on a high floor or a low
floor?

03:40:27.702 --> 03:40:31.834
MATT: "I choose to live on a low floor."

03:40:31.834 --> 03:40:33.453
LAURA: Less stairs.

03:40:33.453 --> 03:40:36.866
MATT: "Yeah. Gets warmer up top, anyway. Don't
want that."

03:40:36.866 --> 03:40:40.284
LIAM: The walk-ups are tough.

03:40:40.284 --> 03:40:44.077
MATT: "You're telling me. Want my quads to be
ready in case I need to go into a sprint. Run for

03:40:44.077 --> 03:40:45.484
"my life. You know."

03:40:45.484 --> 03:40:49.674
LAURA: Do you build the machines down there?

03:40:49.674 --> 03:40:54.837
MATT: "I used to. Occasionally."

03:40:54.837 --> 03:40:56.829
LIAM: What do you do now?

03:40:56.829 --> 03:40:58.112
MATT: "I supervise."

03:40:58.112 --> 03:41:00.014
MARISHA: Supervise what?

03:41:00.014 --> 03:41:05.749
MATT: "You're being a bit nosy here, not going to
lie. I know we just met, and I'm helping showing

03:41:05.749 --> 03:41:06.878
"you around, but--"

03:41:06.878 --> 03:41:07.996
MARISHA: You offered, though.

03:41:07.996 --> 03:41:10.107
MATT: "I offered to tell you about the city, not
about myself."

03:41:10.107 --> 03:41:11.400
MARISHA: Okay.

03:41:11.400 --> 03:41:19.198
LIAM: Well, we are a traveling group of hired guns
who can get shit done. We are a varied group of

03:41:19.198 --> 03:41:27.365
people. Some of us learn and some of us are good
at smashing skulls. We would do any kind of work

03:41:27.365 --> 03:41:30.827
if it were presented to us. That's who we are.
We're a motley group of assholes.

03:41:30.827 --> 03:41:34.372
MATT: "I think you'll fit in quite well around
here."

03:41:34.372 --> 03:41:36.572
MARISHA: Did you get fired?

03:41:36.572 --> 03:41:38.168
TRAVIS: Oh. My. God.

03:41:38.168 --> 03:41:39.318
MARISHA: What? I just want to know.

03:41:39.318 --> 03:41:41.169
LIAM: I was trying to defuse--

03:41:41.169 --> 03:41:46.349
MARISHA: Yeah, you gave her information, so maybe
she'll give us some. Did you get fired?

03:41:46.349 --> 03:41:48.893
Suspended?

03:41:48.893 --> 03:41:55.354
MATT: "I haven't found a vocation that fits my
personality. Tried some things. Wasn't my thing."

03:41:55.354 --> 03:41:57.429
MARISHA: Undecided major. I like it.

03:41:57.429 --> 03:42:01.852
SAM: Where should we stay tonight?

03:42:01.852 --> 03:42:06.452
MATT: "Well, there's a few different places. Are
you looking for a quiet spot to sleep or are you

03:42:06.452 --> 03:42:09.327
"looking for a wild place to not sleep?"

03:42:09.327 --> 03:42:13.435
SAM: Beau is looking for a wild place to not
sleep.

03:42:13.435 --> 03:42:15.661
MATT: "Blushing Tankard it is."

03:42:15.661 --> 03:42:17.127
SAM: Gushing Tankard.

03:42:17.127 --> 03:42:18.656
ALL: Blushing Tankard.

03:42:18.656 --> 03:42:32.094
MATT: At this point, the oranges and reds of
sundown have taken the sky and you hear this pop sound.

03:42:32.094 --> 03:42:35.297
SAM: What was that?

03:42:35.297 --> 03:42:36.900
TALIESIN: Wait for it.

03:42:36.900 --> 03:42:41.716
MATT: You look up and you can see splashes of
light in the sky above you. Faint fireworks start

03:42:41.716 --> 03:42:42.851
going off.

03:42:42.851 --> 03:42:44.073
MARISHA: What?

03:42:44.073 --> 03:42:46.339
SAM: Are the Dodgers playing?

03:42:46.339 --> 03:42:54.211
MATT: You start hearing shouts. Voices echoing
from the city, from the towers, from behind you,

03:42:54.211 --> 03:43:03.653
along the Shelf. All these steam whistles start
going off down below, echoing from below. The

03:43:03.653 --> 03:43:10.324
streets suddenly come to life as people begin to
rush out of buildings, taking off their aprons,

03:43:10.324 --> 03:43:15.377
taking off their gloves, setting off whatever
their work attire is and rushing off to home to

03:43:15.377 --> 03:43:22.902
unwind. There is a rush of energy, and you begin
to realize Beau wasn't kidding.

03:43:22.902 --> 03:43:24.239
LAURA: This is a party town!

03:43:24.239 --> 03:43:25.376
MARISHA: This city's awesome!

03:43:25.376 --> 03:43:29.959
MATT: They work hard, and at night, they play
hard.

03:43:29.959 --> 03:43:31.590
TALIESIN: You've brought us to Florida.

03:43:31.590 --> 03:43:33.578
MATT: And that's where we're going to finish
tonight's episode.

03:43:33.578 --> 03:43:35.254
(cheering)

03:43:35.254 --> 03:43:37.289
LIAM: Steampunk Burning Man!

03:43:37.289 --> 03:43:41.194
MARISHA: (singing) Orlando! Orlando!

03:43:41.194 --> 03:43:44.324
SAM: Fourth Street in Austin.

03:43:44.324 --> 03:43:53.665
MATT: Oh, Fourth Street. I love Fourth Street.
We'll pick up this next week. We may or may not

03:43:53.665 --> 03:43:55.693
have Ashley, depending on if Skype is available.

03:43:55.693 --> 03:43:56.720
SAM: Wait, what?

03:43:56.720 --> 03:43:58.814
ASHLEY: But the following week I'll be here.

03:43:58.814 --> 03:44:03.974
MATT: Nevertheless, thank you guys so much.

03:44:03.974 --> 03:44:09.327
SAM: Thank you, Wil Wheaton, for not ruining our
lives.

03:44:09.327 --> 03:44:15.215
MATT: Yeah, Wil's been off-set trying to curse my
dice. Apparently, I deflected it to the party.

03:44:15.215 --> 03:44:19.023
Happy about that. Thank you guys for joining us
tonight.

03:44:19.023 --> 03:44:21.145
SAM: Ready Player One was good, everything else
bad.

03:44:21.145 --> 03:44:25.403
(laughter)

03:44:25.403 --> 03:44:30.819
MATT: Anyway, we'll see you guys next week. Have a
wonderful weekend and the following week from

03:44:30.819 --> 03:44:34.473
there. We love you, and is it Thursday yet? Good
night.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.308
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:06.160
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.291
ALL: Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:11.070
MATT: Before we get into tonight's game, we have
some announcements to get through, so be patient

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.256
with us for a moment as we give a big shout out
and thanks to our two sponsors for tonight's

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:18.627
episode, starting with our friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond.
Sam?

00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:24.939
SAM: As I said last week, the Waterdeep: Dragon
Heist is now available on D&amp;amp;D Beyond. As Max said

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.894
last week. They'll guide your Waterdeep campaign
from levels one to five. After that, explore the

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:35.662
legendary Undermountain Dungeon below the city
with Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage for levels

00:00:35.662 --> 00:00:41.573
five through 20! Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad
Mage is available for pre-order on D&amp;amp;D Beyond and

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:52.605
will release November 2nd. Now, because D&amp;amp;D Beyond
is such a generous sponsor of this show, Laura, I

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:59.820
wanted to show the audience some of what we do
with that sponsorship money. We take it and we

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.044
turn it into this amazing studio which has amazing
equipment and after effects and editing suites and

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:15.909
cool special effects, so we put together a really
cool ad for them using all the equipment, and if

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.910
you guys would turn to the monitor and see what we
made.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.745
TRAVIS: What.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:20.450
LAURA: Oh no.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.530
SAM: Hi, guys! As you know, we love
D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.398
It's easy to use, the interface is super high
tech. Since their sponsorship helps us make this

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:34.069
show, we thought we'd use all the cutting edge
editing software in our fabulous new studio to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:42.127
make D&amp;amp;D Beyond a mind-blowing special effects ad.
(explosions) Explosions, I assume. For instance,

00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:48.939
look at my face. Looks normal now, right? But when
we add high tech CGI effects: Oh, I look like a

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:59.898
beholder! Roar! Antimagic cone! D&amp;amp;D Beyond! Okay,
reset. Now, check out this awesome face swapping

00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:07.756
feature. Okay, right now, I look like Sam Riegel.
But now (whoop). Oh, I'm Matt Mercer. Welcome to

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:14.545
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice
actors get to look at how handsome I am. Oh, now

00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:21.659
I'm doing a Cajun accent. Okay, reset. But that's
not all. Now, it looks like I'm holding nothing,

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:28.739
right? But now, with special effects. (gasp) Oh!
I've got an adorable blink dog in my hands. Aw,

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.440
isn't Nugget so cute? And reset. Wow, that was
just a taste of the amazing special effects that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.171
D&amp;amp;D Beyond sponsorship covers here at the studio.
Thanks, D&amp;amp;D Beyond, and if you don't mind, Scotty,

00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:51.167
beam me up! I'm probably gone by now, right? That
was great! Thanks, Max. I can't wait to see how it

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:55.060
cuts together. I can't wait to see all the
effects.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.900
SAM: They didn't put any fucking effects on. I
mean, we had it all mapped out. It was going to be

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.291
amazing, and now it's just--

00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:10.950
LAURA: It's really lame.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.536
SAM: It's pretty lame, and also kind of insulting
to Matt. I mean, if you want to be honest about

00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:22.492
it. Sorry to the audience, and sorry to D&amp;amp;D
Beyond. Back to you, Matt!

00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:25.027
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:25.027 --> 00:03:30.340
TRAVIS: Yet more evidence why we should see the
return of Max "Better Sam" James.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:47.487
MATT: All righty. One of these days, your
escalation is going to be the end of us all. Not

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:48.945
looking forward to it.

00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:52.098
SAM: Guys, for D&amp;amp;D Beyond, I brought a loaded
gun!

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.381
MATT: One of these days.

00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:59.426
SAM: Guys, it's really amazing!

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:07.976
MATT: Oh my god. On sale now we do have our very
first live show in New York City. It's coming up

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:13.099
pretty soon, actually, in two weeks. We'll be at
the United Palace in Washington Heights, Thursday,

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.949
October 4th for the live show. Tickets are still
available now at Ticketmaster. You can check out

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.226
all the details to do so at critrole.com.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:23.066
LAURA: I'm sorry. No, just keep talking.

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:28.162
MATT: I got to get it out now. Better now, than in
the narrative. Also, for those who had a chance to

00:04:28.162 --> 00:04:33.268
see it, thank you so much for tuning in to this
week's episode of Between the Sheets, our new show

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:39.931
hosted by the fantastic Brian W. Foster. Taliesin
was our first guinea pig for that. Really

00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:41.808
in-depth, awesome interview, and peek behind
the--

00:04:41.808 --> 00:04:44.734
TALIESIN: Really blitzed on that stuff, it was
pretty fun.

00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:47.417
LIAM: Why did we start with a closer, though?

00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:52.108
TALIESIN: Let's just start on grain alcohol, also.
That was a good call on my part.

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:58.536
MATT: Well done, Taliesin. If you want to talk a
little bit about the release schedule for that

00:04:58.778 --> 00:05:00.259
show, for Between the Sheets, it's every--

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.221
MARISHA: Every Monday, 7:00pm on Twitch is where
it premieres. Then, of course, you can immediately

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:13.909
catch it on VOD on Twitch if you've subscribed to
us on Critical Role's Twitch. Critical Role's

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:20.819
Twitch! I don't know; I'm pulling a Sam Riegel,
I'm adding graphics that aren't here. There's a

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:30.327
graphic, right? Then it releases on Wednesdays on
Critical Role's YouTube channel at 10:00am, so if

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:34.065
you do not catch it live or if you are not
subscribed, you'll get it on Wednesday.

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:39.756
MATT: There you go, and to celebrate the launch of
Between the Sheets, Brian's going to be doing a

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:50.842
Reddit AMA tomorrow at 2:00pm Pacific. If you want
to go ahead and razz him through text format, see

00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:57.503
him on the Critical Role Reddit tomorrow at 2:00pm
Pacific. We've been raising a lot great money for

00:05:57.503 --> 00:06:00.457
Sam's charity, Pablove Foundation, if you want to
talk a little bit about that?

00:06:00.457 --> 00:06:06.226
SAM: Yes, the charity that I'm very fond of,
Pablove Foundation, they battle childhood cancer.

00:06:06.226 --> 00:06:11.116
What am I supposed to talk about tonight? I'm
supposed to talk about the fact that because you

00:06:11.116 --> 00:06:16.193
guys raised so much money, we're doing a one-shot
tomorrow night on the Critical Role Twitch

00:06:16.193 --> 00:06:23.404
channel. We're going to do a Crash Pandas one-shot
with me as the Game Master and people like Laura

00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:26.709
Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, Travis
Willingham--

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:28.606
LAURA: I still have my purse on!

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:34.203
SAM: -- Matt Mercer. Basically everyone at this
table except for Taliesin will be there.

00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:37.172
TALIESIN: I got some shit to do, people.

00:06:37.172 --> 00:06:40.636
MATT: Got enough coverage this week already; he
can sit out a bit.

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:47.971
SAM: Tune in tomorrow night at 7:00 to see the
show. We will also be giving away prizes to some

00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:54.740
lucky person who made a donation and tagged
Critical Role in the donation field. That's it! Yay!

00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:57.543
MATT: Great. Laura, you said you wanted to talk
about merch stuff?

00:06:57.543 --> 00:07:00.468
LAURA: Yeah! We got some things back in stock,
y'all.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.517
TRAVIS: You're still wearing your purse, by the
way

00:07:02.517 --> 00:07:04.494
LAURA: No, I'm not, stop it.

00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:06.078
MARISHA: She had to think about it, though.

00:07:06.078 --> 00:07:10.234
LAURA: I did! We got the Wildemount dice back in
stock! The pretty blue ones that we have and then

00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:16.610
we got limited amount of The Mighty Nein pins back
in stock. Check that out right now; they're

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:25.723
awesome. We have the maps back in stock, and I
have heard the t-shirts are being restocked very

00:07:25.723 --> 00:07:29.734
shortly. That means check it out this weekend,
like Friday or Monday. They should be back in

00:07:29.734 --> 00:07:31.471
there so check it out.

00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:32.656
SAM: Refresh!

00:07:32.656 --> 00:07:35.355
LAURA: Just refresh, and if you want them, they
should be there.

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:38.976
MATT: There you go. Thank you, Laura, and a thank
you to our second sponsor. I wanted to bookend it,

00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:44.193
sponsor-sponsor. Returning is our friend here, The
Rook and The Raven, who have been doing their

00:07:44.193 --> 00:07:47.402
awesome-- if you guys aren't familiar, haven't
seen the previous episodes-- these really awesome,

high quality, discbound gaming notebooks for your
campaign. The fronts, you can see, are laser

etched designs of awesome maps from our fantastic
friend, Deven Rue, who did our Dwendalian Empire

00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:04.178
map earlier in the campaign, which you saw, and
just came into stock, apparently. This is their

00:08:04.178 --> 00:08:07.293
Mischief and Misadventure book where you can go
ahead and put all your campaign notes and your

00:08:07.293 --> 00:08:13.649

00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:35.879
SAM: Yay sponsors!

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:36.550
LAURA: Woo!

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.469
MATT: All of the sweet effects, Sam.

00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:42.921
SAM: Yeah, someone will add some effects at some
point.

00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:44.112
MATT: At some point.

00:08:44.112 --> 00:08:44.843
TALIESIN: Pew pew.

00:08:44.843 --> 00:08:48.906
MATT: I feel like we're really going to have to
release that now with effects put onto it.

00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:51.211
TRAVIS: Arsequeef will take care of it.

00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:59.734
MATT: Yeah, he will. Without further ado, let's go
ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:09:00.543 --> 00:09:04.577
[click, TV static]

00:09:04.577 --> 00:10:22.338
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:28.445
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty
Nein had found their way outside of the Dwendalian

00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:35.160
Empire and to the first city along the coast of
the Menagerie Coast, Nicodranas, where Fjord had

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.814
passed through previously on his various
adventures through the waters nearby, and Jester's

00:10:39.814 --> 00:10:47.680
upbringing was entirely within. You had met with
Jester's mother, Marion, The Ruby of the Sea, as

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:54.451
well as began to seek information about an
individual that was connected with your time up at

00:10:54.451 --> 00:11:00.954
Shadycreek Run and the sphere that you had
absorbed, Fjord. In this period of time, you

00:11:00.954 --> 00:11:06.355
discovered there was an individual that had grown
jealous and strangely aggressive regarding the

00:11:06.355 --> 00:11:12.203
companionship of Jester's mother and as such, you
began to seek information about them in a way to

00:11:12.203 --> 00:11:23.474
put an end to this behavior. In doing so, you went
to a tavern and met a captain who had possibly

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:31.108
room for a few of you to travel with about a week
from now. You met a tortle-- for many of you, the

00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:37.208
first time you've encountered a tortle-- who had
some interesting things to say and a lead on the

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:43.111
individual you were looking for. You also found
information about what's called the Sluice Weave,

00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:51.208
a series of waterways beneath the city where this
Algar, this individual that was creating tension

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:57.188
with The Ruby of the Sea, works and oversees. You
made your way to the outskirts of the docks,

00:11:57.188 --> 00:12:01.500
searched through the water for an entrance,
managed to muscle your way through the grates

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:07.870
below, nearly drowning the pets you had recently
purchased. You encountered a few small water

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:15.558
elementals and eventually came upon one of the
nexus areas of this waterway where there was an

00:12:15.558 --> 00:12:24.591
elemental entity named Xundi that was bound to
this location and was helping run and control the

00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:31.989
water in and out, under the supervision of Algar.
Catching them, but, however, not being as stealthy

00:12:31.989 --> 00:12:39.225
as you had hoped, you were noticed, and as such, a
battle commenced where Xundi, this elemental

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:47.448
figure, was given the command by Algar to take
care of you and see you out. In this fray, a

00:12:47.448 --> 00:12:55.178
number of you fell and fell again, but through a
combination of Fjord's teleportation spell

00:12:55.178 --> 00:13:02.079
abilities, you guys keeping each other alive, you
repeatedly punching very hard whatever got in your

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:13.315
way, you managed to subdue Algar, destroy his two
guards, raised one as a specter, and noticing that

00:13:13.315 --> 00:13:17.533
there was something affixed to his wrist that
seemed to have some connection with Xundi, Fjord

00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:27.064
cut his left hand off. And that's where we pick
up. The rest of you are slowly pulling your way,

00:13:27.064 --> 00:13:32.947
your bodies are completely waterlogged from
rushing through thigh-high waters and many of you

00:13:32.947 --> 00:13:39.981
being submerged-- nearly drowned at times. You
gather yourself as you realize the threat is gone.

00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:45.077
The water elemental's destroyed, and this entity
that was once attacking you seems to have lowered

00:13:45.077 --> 00:13:52.791
their trident and turned around, their attention
elsewhere, releasing any aggressive demeanor they

00:13:52.791 --> 00:14:01.465
have held since your arrival. At this time, you,
Beau, as you turn the corner and mashed the face

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:10.259
of Algar against the wet stone wall, you look over
to see both Fjord slice the hand off of his right wrist--

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:12.069
MARISHA: Wait, right or left?

00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:18.729
MATT: Oh, sorry, left hand. It's to your right.
You see the left hand get cut off. He screams out,

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:25.709
bleeding from the stump as he grabs it with his
other hand, the hand and the bracelet that was

00:14:25.709 --> 00:14:32.172
attached both clattering to the ground with a wet
thud and it (spinning), falling over to the side.

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:41.847
Beau, you also look over and notice there is this
horrible, strange, undead entity floating

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:50.124
immediately to your right of you and Algar, this
spectral creature that is ethereal, but made of

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:58.134
dark blue and black energy, this drowned spirit
that is giving off this horrible, guttural sucking

00:14:58.134 --> 00:15:05.416
sound and Fjord still stands there, blade in hand,
looming over the two of you, technically.

00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:09.522
LIAM: They're hidden from all the rest of our
views, right?

00:15:09.813 --> 00:15:14.998
MATT: Yeah, you guys know where they went, but you
have no idea what's transpired since. Currently,

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:20.499
Xundi is floating towards the back of the
chamber, towards where they are. What do you do?

00:15:20.499 --> 00:15:26.177
MARISHA: Fjord, is he with you? I'm pointing at
the spectral guy.

00:15:26.177 --> 00:15:27.659
TRAVIS: He is.

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:30.979
MARISHA: So I shouldn't kill him?

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:38.370
TRAVIS: I don't think so. Might be unwise.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.304
MARISHA: You all right, man?

00:15:41.304 --> 00:15:46.060
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want that bracelet. I'll reach
down and pick it up.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.276
MATT: Okay. You pick the bracelet and Algar's
like, (groaning, pained panting).

00:15:50.276 --> 00:15:53.530
TRAVIS: I'll hold it in front of his face. You
used this to control that?

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.845
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.

00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:58.829
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm still holding him down.

00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:02.344
TRAVIS: That's a 25.

00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:11.433
MATT: "Yeah. It was part of my post. What are you
going to do? Please don't kill me. Please."

00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:15.204
TRAVIS: Well, it depends on how forthcoming you
are. Anything I need to know to operate this thing

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:18.217
or I just slap it on and start giving commands?

00:16:18.217 --> 00:16:23.980
MATT: At this point, Xundi appears at the back
of the chamber. Rounding the corner, the large,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:36.327
thick, barrel-chested, fish-like form wearing this
very well-tailored vest with the silks of the

00:16:36.327 --> 00:16:43.743
shirt billowing around its wet elemental form, its
fish face curled into this sly grin. It spins

00:16:43.743 --> 00:16:56.830
around and looks towards Algar and you guys. It
says, with this low, burbling fish voice, "Ah. I

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:07.414
"see the hour is nigh for vengeance." It pulls the
collar from its neck and it clangs onto the ground.

00:17:07.814 --> 00:17:12.384
(uncertain noises)

00:17:12.714 --> 00:17:14.373
SAM: Ask him to put it back on!

00:17:14.373 --> 00:17:17.122
LIAM: I'm going to start covering distance.

00:17:17.642 --> 00:17:19.990
TRAVIS: Indeed. The hour is nigh.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:32.935
MATT: It puts out its hand. "You have seemingly
come to the aid of this humble individual. Please,

00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:36.215
"hand me the implements of my enslavement."

00:17:36.215 --> 00:17:41.342
TRAVIS: May I ask how you came to be enslaved in
this predicament in the first place?

00:17:41.342 --> 00:17:43.644
MATT: "That is not of your concern."

00:17:43.644 --> 00:17:46.850
TRAVIS: How about an answer for the bracelet?

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:52.138
MATT: Algar's still "(moaning). Don't trust him!"

00:17:52.138 --> 00:17:53.344
MARISHA: I punch him.

00:17:53.344 --> 00:17:54.814
TRAVIS: That's right you do!

00:17:54.814 --> 00:17:56.099
MARISHA: Shut up.

00:17:56.099 --> 00:18:00.033
MATT: The rest of you are closing up on this
space.

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:02.433
TALIESIN: We're making our way there.

00:18:02.433 --> 00:18:08.254
MATT: You guys leap up and begin to climb. In the
meantime, the creature looks to you and says,

00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:20.958
"Let's just say that there were powerful minds
that were interested in the benefits of my

00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:25.133
"undivided attention towards things that were of
not my interest."

00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:31.646
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to hear that. I never like to
see a creature put under the boot of somebody else

00:18:31.646 --> 00:18:35.246
for their gain. I'll toss him the bracelet.

00:18:35.246 --> 00:18:44.123
MATT: Catches it, picks up the necklace, and both
of them get tucked inside of its vest with this

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:58.460
heavy, wet sucking sound. Looks over to Algar. "It
would appear that you have this taken care of, but

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.395
would you do me the honors?"

00:19:00.395 --> 00:19:04.036
MARISHA: Well...

00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:08.962
TRAVIS: Actually, if you wouldn't mind, we have
further need--

00:19:08.962 --> 00:19:16.386
MARISHA: Questions, yeah. Just a conversation,
maybe, first. Can you wait five minutes?

00:19:16.386 --> 00:19:21.914
TRAVIS: Not even five minutes. Perhaps if he can
tell us the safe way out of here in exchange for

00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:27.347
letting us have our way with Algar, he could be on
his way and we can have our time.

00:19:27.347 --> 00:19:32.434
MARISHA: I'm confused on the levels on what you're
talking about what all you want, but I'm with it.

00:19:32.434 --> 00:19:36.476
Wait, do we do need from Algar--?

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:38.232
TRAVIS: But I don't want to kill Algar.

00:19:38.232 --> 00:19:39.517
MARISHA: You do want to kill Algar?

00:19:39.517 --> 00:19:40.384
TRAVIS: I do not. Nope.

00:19:40.384 --> 00:19:43.108
MARISHA: You don't want to kill Algar. Yeah.
Okay.

00:19:43.108 --> 00:19:47.003
TRAVIS: Hand up, one sec. Yeah, I'm saying: Don't
kill Algar.

00:19:47.003 --> 00:19:50.777
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll give earmuffs to Algar. Still
have my knee in his face.

00:19:50.777 --> 00:19:53.305
MATT: He's bleeding out.

00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:56.570
TRAVIS: I want to know if there's other booby
traps.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.956
LIAM: We're all watching?

00:19:57.956 --> 00:20:00.651
MATT: Yeah, you guys all now have gone into the
chamber. You can see this.

00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:05.784
LIAM: I'm going to attempt to do that thing I've
seen Beauregard do so many times and foof up my

00:20:05.784 --> 00:20:08.631
biceps and look intimidating.

00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:10.719
MARISHA: What do we do with Algar?

00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:12.185
TRAVIS: I'm not sure yet.

00:20:12.185 --> 00:20:17.667
MARISHA: By the way? I think Algar's unconscious.
He might be dead.

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:18.530
TRAVIS: Algar?

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.349
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:21.162
TRAVIS: I'll give him a little cheek slap.

00:20:21.162 --> 00:20:25.865
MATT: He's definitely passed out. He's not dead,
but there is a large amount of blood coming out of

00:20:25.865 --> 00:20:28.119
his severed stump.

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:32.700
LAURA: I stand next to Caleb and poke his biceps.
Ooh!

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.611
SAM: Guys need any help?

00:20:34.611 --> 00:20:36.286
MARISHA: Should we--

00:20:36.286 --> 00:20:40.989
TRAVIS: I'll tear off a sheet of ribbon off of my
sleeve and I'll wrap it around his forearm like a

00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:42.207
tight tourniquet.

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:44.472
MATT: Make a medicine check.

00:20:44.472 --> 00:20:48.679
LAURA: Do you want me to stabilize him? I can do
that.

00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:52.411
TRAVIS: 11.

00:20:52.411 --> 00:20:57.516
MATT: That's enough to stabilize, okay. You've
prevented him from bleeding out. He looks pale and

00:20:57.734 --> 00:21:06.072
has lost a lot of blood and there is this dark
pool that's still suffusing the space around him

00:21:06.072 --> 00:21:13.226
on the stone floor on the raised area of the
hallway. So he's stable. Xundi, as the rest of

00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:21.989
you came around the corner, you can see him
standing there looking at the group. "Well, I have

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:34.596
things to take care of now." It looks to you.
"Khedive Xundi is my title. I've been held here

00:21:34.596 --> 00:21:42.302
"for too long. Should you find yourself among the
endless seas of my world, come to my Silver Silt Palace."

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:43.813
TRAVIS: Silver Silt?

00:21:43.813 --> 00:21:50.740
MATT: "There I shall reward you for your
assistance. Now, I'll go to free my partner."

00:21:50.740 --> 00:22:01.723
MARISHA: Hey, Xundi, real quick? Just seems like
you were powering the entire city. How would we do

00:22:01.723 --> 00:22:03.739
that without you?

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.720
MATT: "That's a good question," and it leaves.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.161
LAURA: What was the palace, what did he say?

00:22:10.161 --> 00:22:12.066
ALL: Silver Silt.

00:22:12.066 --> 00:22:14.259
LAURA: Where was the palace, is it in the ocean?

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:16.071
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure--

00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:17.737
LAURA: Was it in the ocean?

00:22:17.737 --> 00:22:19.782
SAM: It's probably not on land, yeah.

00:22:19.782 --> 00:22:25.265
TALIESIN: Is everybody okay by the way do we have
every-- Oh god! I'm going to cast Turn Undead.

00:22:25.265 --> 00:22:25.988
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:22:25.988 --> 00:22:27.196
MATT: Okay.

00:22:27.196 --> 00:22:28.508
MARISHA: To the guy?

00:22:28.508 --> 00:22:30.128
LIAM: Yeah.

00:22:30.128 --> 00:22:35.652
MATT: That is a 14, what's your DC?

00:22:35.652 --> 00:22:37.528
TALIESIN: DC on Turn Undead? Let me find it
again--

00:22:37.528 --> 00:22:39.793
MATT: What's your spell DC?

00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:43.110
TALIESIN: Spell DC is 16.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:48.413
MATT: The specter goes (groaning) and immediately
turns around and starts drifting down the hallway

00:22:48.413 --> 00:22:52.223
away from you, giving this horrible hollow sucking
scream.

00:22:52.223 --> 00:22:53.555
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:55.509
MARISHA: Did we need him? Was he useful, too?

00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:58.046
TRAVIS: Nope, no. I just forgot he was there.

00:22:58.046 --> 00:23:00.275
TALIESIN: All right, let's--

00:23:00.275 --> 00:23:02.315
SAM: Good job, Mr. Clay.

00:23:02.315 --> 00:23:05.010
TALISIN: If everyone's got a minute, does anybody
need healing?

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.877
TRAVIS: Actually, Algar might need a quick--

00:23:06.877 --> 00:23:08.187
LAURA: I have a question.

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:09.702
TALIESIN: I'm going to start a ten minute--

00:23:09.702 --> 00:23:10.901
LAURA: Are we going to kill him?

00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:11.924
TRAVIS: No!

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:16.895
LAURA: Well, if we don't, how do we get away
without anyone knowing that we killed his guards

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:19.101
and we let the guy go?

00:23:19.101 --> 00:23:21.403
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:23:21.403 --> 00:23:25.116
SAM: What do you mean? Just tell him: don't tell
anyone or we'll come back and kill you.

00:23:25.622 --> 00:23:26.251
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:23:26.251 --> 00:23:28.725
LAURA: What if he goes in to like a protection
service or something?

00:23:28.725 --> 00:23:34.591
SAM: We need to have a conversation with him
afterwards. We can tell him to leave the city and

00:23:34.591 --> 00:23:38.003
never come back or we'll take off your other
hand!

00:23:38.003 --> 00:23:42.550
TRAVIS: I like that. Plus, they're guards, it's
their duty to fight, which they did and we

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.396
defended ourselves.

00:23:44.396 --> 00:23:45.442
LAURA: That's true.

00:23:45.442 --> 00:23:46.712
TRAVIS: I feel like--

00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:49.835
LAURA: I mean, we weren't even going to attack if
he hadn't attacked us in the first place.

00:23:49.835 --> 00:23:55.143
LIAM: Although, to play devil's advocate, you are
right: he could change his mind down the line and

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:57.048
try to get revenge on you or your mother.

00:23:57.048 --> 00:23:59.486
LAURA: I don't want him to get revenge on my
mother.

00:23:59.486 --> 00:24:01.583
TRAVIS: We'll make it pretty quick.

00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:04.562
MARISHA: We can do other things to make sure--

00:24:04.562 --> 00:24:09.041
LAURA: Can we make it seem like Algar was the one
who did all this?

00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.134
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:24:11.134 --> 00:24:13.833
LAURA: Like maybe he turned--

00:24:13.833 --> 00:24:16.717
SAM: Did he see you, does he know who you are?

00:24:16.717 --> 00:24:17.884
LAURA: No?

00:24:17.884 --> 00:24:24.292
SAM: Then why would connect anything to his
mother? Unless we tell him. To your mother, I mean.

00:24:24.307 --> 00:24:31.969
LAURA: Well, because I heard Tracy say that she
was staying at the fancy-- the Lavish Chateau.

00:24:31.969 --> 00:24:36.603
SAM: It's a hotel that lots of Tracys I think
probably stay at.

00:24:36.603 --> 00:24:39.025
TRAVIS: If we want to be really careful, there are
other places to stay.

00:24:39.025 --> 00:24:43.378
LIAM: I'm also curious to know what he is doing
down here in the first place.

00:24:43.378 --> 00:24:50.343
SAM: Why don't you step aside, so that he doesn't
see your face when he wakes up, or disguise your

00:24:50.343 --> 00:24:51.370
face so he hasn't--

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:52.940
LAURA: Oh, good call.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:59.208
LIAM: I would like to throw my hat in the ring to
say that I think he might need to die here, ja.

00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:04.107
SAM: Okay, so we got two kills, four maybes.

00:25:04.107 --> 00:25:09.760
LAURA: What if we send him out to sea? Don't
necessarily kill him, but make him leave and then

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.797
make it seem like he was the one that did
everything.

00:25:12.797 --> 00:25:16.885
TRAVIS: I think we're going to listen to your
influence on this one, Jester; it is closest to you.

00:25:17.287 --> 00:25:27.889
MARISHA: We do have one passage secured with
Captain Adella. We could just tell Edér-- what's

00:25:27.889 --> 00:25:36.864
his name? Algar. That's Pillars of Eternity. We
could just tell Algar: You have a new plot in

00:25:36.864 --> 00:25:40.770
life now and it's going to be to help Captain
Adella.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.106
SAM: Wait, is Yasha going with Adella? No.

00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:44.709
TRAVIS: No.

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:46.551
SAM: She's on a different boat, maybe.

00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:48.509
MATT: Yasha's with you.

00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:51.929
SAM: No, I know but she's going to be leaving at
some point soon, right?

00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:55.887
MATT: She was making her way towards the sea, but
hasn't made passage anywhere.

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:59.834
TRAVIS: No hard plans. Well, let's wake up this
son of a bitch.

00:25:59.834 --> 00:26:01.478
SAM: We can always kill him.

00:26:01.478 --> 00:26:02.636
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll get answers.

00:26:02.636 --> 00:26:04.048
LAURA: Worst case scenario, we kill him.

00:26:04.048 --> 00:26:05.939
SAM: Maybe best case scenario, yes.

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:08.133
LIAM: Just put a pin in it and see what we find
out here.

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:10.616
MARISHA: Do you want to disguise yourself, before
we do this?

00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:18.072
LAURA: Oh, okay, yes. I will disguise myself as a
tortle, but not the that guy we met, like a tortle

00:26:18.072 --> 00:26:19.783
that's a girl.

00:26:19.783 --> 00:26:21.325
MATT: Okay.

00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:23.142
LIAM: Period.

00:26:23.142 --> 00:26:24.968
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's it.

00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:26.836
MATT: I like that, a gortle.

00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:28.887
SAM: So exactly the same as the guy, except long
hair.

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:33.011
LAURA: No, no hair, but, like, a skirt.

00:26:33.011 --> 00:26:36.116
MATT: There you go. Tortle Skirts.

00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:39.340
LAURA: Because girls wear skirts, obviously,
that's what girls do.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.455
MATT: Jester needs to get out more.

00:26:41.455 --> 00:26:43.334
LIAM: Tortles wear skorts.

00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:45.335
TALIESIN: At some point there's going to be a
healing spell.

00:26:45.335 --> 00:26:52.847
MARISHA: I get back on top of Algar and I'm
restraining him, pinning him down.

00:26:52.847 --> 00:26:55.707
TALIESIN: Does anybody not need healing?

00:26:55.707 --> 00:26:58.272
LIAM: Well, Herr Clay, do you need healing?

00:26:58.272 --> 00:26:59.182
SAM: I don't.

00:26:59.182 --> 00:27:00.922
MARISHA: I could use some healing.

00:27:00.922 --> 00:27:02.193
LIAM: Yeah, what about yourself?

00:27:02.193 --> 00:27:03.785
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm getting in on this.

00:27:03.785 --> 00:27:07.127
LIAM: I could use some, I don't know if you are
sharing?

00:27:07.127 --> 00:27:08.891
LAURA: You could do a Prayer of Healing.

00:27:08.891 --> 00:27:11.221
TALIESIN: That was what I've been doing, a Prayer
of Healing.

00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:14.018
LAURA: Oh really? We could both do Prayers of
Healing.

00:27:14.018 --> 00:27:19.417
TALIESIN: All right, so I'm doing everybody except
Nott, and I'm adding Algar to this.

00:27:19.417 --> 00:27:20.112
MATT: Okay.

00:27:20.112 --> 00:27:22.843
LAURA: I'm going to say I'm doing it, too, but I'm
not really going to.

00:27:22.843 --> 00:27:26.476
LIAM: On the count of three. One, two--

00:27:26.476 --> 00:27:29.813
TALIESIN: That's 14 points to everybody.

00:27:29.813 --> 00:27:33.499
LAURA: Dear Traveler, please heal everyone. Do you
guys feel better?

00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:36.497
MARISHA: I do actually, thank you. How many
points?

00:27:36.497 --> 00:27:37.301
TALIESIN: 14.

00:27:37.301 --> 00:27:39.131
SAM: Thanks Mr. Clay and Jester.

00:27:39.131 --> 00:27:40.970
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:49.686
MATT: As the wave of healing divine energy
emanates from Clay's focused point, Algar who's

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:54.920
still being held against the wall by Beau,
(gasping)

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:01.223
TRAVIS: I'll bring the tip of the falchion right
under his chin. You know, before we begin, we got

00:28:01.223 --> 00:28:06.476
this thing about calling out, yelling, really
sensitive eardrums, so let's not do that.

00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:13.942
MARISHA: Also, before we begin, I want to make
sure that you know how serious we are in getting

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:19.103
honesty from you. I take his head and I go
whack-whack into the wall.

00:28:19.103 --> 00:28:20.508
TRAVIS: Back unconscious!

00:28:20.508 --> 00:28:25.166
MARISHA: I'm going to do Extort Truth on him,
spend a ki point.

00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:26.774
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:28:26.774 --> 00:28:29.252
MARISHA: He has to make a charisma saving throw.

00:28:29.252 --> 00:28:31.262
MATT: That is 14.

00:28:31.262 --> 00:28:34.554
MARISHA: 14 is the DC.

00:28:34.554 --> 00:28:35.908
MATT: Okay, so he succeeds.

00:28:35.908 --> 00:28:37.853
MARISHA: Fucking fuck!

00:28:37.853 --> 00:28:39.529
MATT: You can try it again if you have another ki
point.

00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:40.206
MARISHA: I do.

00:28:40.206 --> 00:28:45.223
MATT: Oh wait, no, let me see, I think he might be
immune to it for the next 24 hours based on the ability.

00:28:45.243 --> 00:28:46.350
MARISHA: What, to mine?

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.099
MATT: If he succeeds on it, yeah. I think so.

00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:52.902
MARISHA: Well then, I go: I don't think you heard
me. Whack-whack, and I'll try one more time.

00:28:52.902 --> 00:28:57.248
MATT: Well, I'm going to double check here, but I
think if he succeeds in the save he's immune to it

00:28:57.248 --> 00:29:00.533
for 24 hours. I could be wrong. Let me double
check here.

00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:02.569
SAM: Has it been 24 hours yet?

00:29:02.569 --> 00:29:05.670
MATT: Yeah, you can wait 24 hours and then come
back to it.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.636
LIAM: Let's just sit here until it's Crash Pandas
tomorrow.

00:29:07.636 --> 00:29:10.199
TRAVIS: I'll lean over to Nott and say: Nott, do
me a favor and make sure he's not carrying

00:29:10.199 --> 00:29:12.297
anything fancy in his pockets.

00:29:12.297 --> 00:29:17.297
SAM: I'm going to rifle through all of his pockets
with lightning speed agility of hand.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:19.231
MATT: Make an investigation check, please.

00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:23.470
SAM: Mm, not good. 12.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:38.709
MATT: 12, okay. Rifling through his bits, you find
21 gold pieces, 45 silver pieces, two platinum pieces.

00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:41.904
SAM: Great.

00:29:41.904 --> 00:29:51.697
MATT: You find one empty glass vial, where a
healing potion was used previously. A dagger, and

00:29:51.697 --> 00:29:59.429
a basic hand crossbow with five bolts.

00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:07.027
SAM: All right, I'll take the gold and the bolts,
and everything else I'll throw in a puddle.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.762
MATT: Perfect.

00:30:08.762 --> 00:30:10.170
LAURA: Does he have any pretty buttons?

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.060
SAM: Does he have any pretty buttons, Matthew?

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.459
MATT: He does, attached to the shirt, if you want
to pluck them.

00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:20.638
SAM: I will pluck the buttons.

00:30:20.638 --> 00:30:22.078
MATT: There are six buttons.

00:30:22.078 --> 00:30:23.864
SAM: Do I have to roll for each one?

00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:29.886
MATT: No, you're fine. To Extort Truth, no, you
can continue to try it if you want to.

00:30:29.886 --> 00:30:31.013
MARISHA: I try it again.

00:30:31.013 --> 00:30:31.974
LIAM: Spam it.

00:30:31.974 --> 00:30:33.458
MARISHA: Whack, whack.

00:30:33.458 --> 00:30:40.066
MATT: All right. With every more button pulled:
(smack) Button. (smack) Button. You're teaming up

00:30:40.066 --> 00:30:40.763
on this regard.

00:30:40.763 --> 00:30:42.245
MARISHA: Real serious.

00:30:42.245 --> 00:30:49.162
MATT: Okay, that's a failure. That's a natural
ten. Okay, you slam his head two more times and

00:30:49.162 --> 00:30:56.603
pinch an area underneath the bottom of the jaw. It
causes his irises to swell for a little bit. He

00:30:56.603 --> 00:30:59.496
looks towards you, head lolling a little bit.

00:30:59.496 --> 00:31:05.440
MARISHA: Now, you're going to answer all these
nice man's questions, okay?

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.969
MATT: He doesn't answer, but you have his
attention.

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:16.320
TRAVIS: What was your job down here, and why were
you giving commands to that creature with this bracelet?

00:31:18.292 --> 00:31:25.614
MATT: "It's my job. I was assigned as the
supervisor of the Sluice Gate."

00:31:25.614 --> 00:31:28.316
TRAVIS: Who do you report to?

00:31:28.316 --> 00:31:38.409
MATT: "I report to the Clovis Concord. I was
assigned here maybe a few months back from Port

00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:48.287
"Zoon, but I largely, specifically, report to the
Marquis and his associates."

00:31:48.287 --> 00:31:49.459
TRAVIS: Marquis...

00:31:49.459 --> 00:31:52.612
MARISHA: The Marquis, the...

00:31:52.612 --> 00:31:55.417
MATT: "Marquis Zhafe Uludan."

00:31:55.417 --> 00:31:58.174
MARISHA: Oh, that guy, right? Lives in the palace
guy?

00:31:58.174 --> 00:32:00.488
TRAVIS: Yeah, not LePual.

00:32:00.488 --> 00:32:01.410
MATT: No.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.364
TRAVIS: Demesne.

00:32:03.364 --> 00:32:13.960
LIAM: Fjord, ask him if knowledge of that water
creature that was here and is gone now, if that is

00:32:14.253 --> 00:32:16.714
known all the way to the top, or is it his bag,
or--

00:32:16.714 --> 00:32:23.031
TRAVIS: The creature that was here and the magic
used to control him, is that something that you

00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:28.856
brought to the table, or was that a device given
to you and known in the higher ranks of government?

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.360
MATT: He's resisting answering.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.298
MARISHA: I dig that finger into his pressure point
a little harder.

00:32:41.298 --> 00:32:47.191
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage
because you have him affected with the Extort--

00:32:47.191 --> 00:32:49.565
MARISHA: Oh, right, charisma. 11.

00:32:49.565 --> 00:32:58.530
MATT: In his current position, he
"(grunting) The Margrave and the Concord are

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:06.590
"aware. This is one of two cities that runs with
one of these marid underneath. (grunts)"

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.401
TRAVIS: One of two cities?

00:33:09.401 --> 00:33:10.156
MATT: "Yes."

00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:11.276
TRAVIS: And the other would be?

00:33:11.276 --> 00:33:12.699
MATT: "Port Damali."

00:33:14.809 --> 00:33:22.916
TRAVIS: Right. What else do you do here in
Nicodranas? What do you do to pass the time,

00:33:23.141 --> 00:33:28.442
Algar? I'm trying to decide whether or not to hand
you over to this fearsome beast over here, and I

00:33:28.442 --> 00:33:30.610
point to (laughing) Caleb.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.724
MATT: With the muscles popping?

00:33:33.724 --> 00:33:41.213
LIAM: Ja, and I send Frumpkin, who's holding his
breath schlooping up on top of his chest. He's

00:33:41.213 --> 00:33:43.274
hungry, and so am I.

00:33:43.274 --> 00:33:47.565
(laughter)

00:33:47.565 --> 00:33:49.331
MARISHA: It puts the lotion on its skin.

00:33:49.331 --> 00:33:51.641
TRAVIS: I'll make you into a jacket.

00:33:51.641 --> 00:34:02.188
MATT: "I drink and carouse, buy fine linens and
furniture."

00:34:02.188 --> 00:34:09.138
LAURA: That's good hobbies.

00:34:09.138 --> 00:34:12.051
MATT: Yeah. You asked what he does with his spare
time.

00:34:12.051 --> 00:34:13.990
TRAVIS: You have any significant others in the
city?

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:30.424
MATT: "None, really. I take companions. The Ruby
is a very beautiful creature."

00:34:30.424 --> 00:34:31.711
LAURA: Woo, Ruby! She's real hot.

00:34:31.711 --> 00:34:37.931
(laughter)

00:34:37.931 --> 00:34:42.174
TRAVIS: Agreed. I think we all know The Ruby of
the Sea far and wide. Think she'd miss you if you

00:34:42.182 --> 00:34:44.035
went missing?

00:34:48.785 --> 00:34:54.159
MATT: "A few more weeks of wooing her, yes."

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.028
MARISHA: No, that's not how that shit works, man.

00:34:56.028 --> 00:34:56.736
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:34:58.511 --> 00:35:00.321
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:35:00.486 --> 00:35:06.311
MATT: There's a conflict inside where his
masculine pride immediately hits with the hit to

00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:08.672
his ego that you just delivered.

00:35:08.672 --> 00:35:12.609
TALIESIN: What were you doing down here?

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:14.679
MATT: "My job."

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:17.194
TALIESIN: What is your job, exactly?

00:35:17.194 --> 00:35:25.566
MATT: "To maintain the Weave. To help exert my
will on the creature that you just freed, so it

00:35:25.566 --> 00:35:31.389
"can direct water towards the various furnaces that
run a lot of the engines that help maintain some

00:35:31.389 --> 00:35:33.090
"of the commerce here in the city."

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.902
LIAM: Ja, and what happens to the commerce in
the city now that you have fucked that up?

00:35:36.902 --> 00:35:47.253
MATT: "Oh, I fucked it up? Well, thanks to your
interference here, they're probably going to have

00:35:47.253 --> 00:35:54.190
"to re-network everything through analog means.
That'll take weeks. It'll be expensive."

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.599
LAURA: Oh man, you're going to be in so much
trouble.

00:35:56.599 --> 00:36:01.522
TALIESIN: Especially, I imagine, if they start
looking into everything you did with that kind of

00:36:01.522 --> 00:36:05.327
power. I mean, having access to that kind of
creature, I can't imagine that you were on the

00:36:05.327 --> 00:36:07.073
up-and-up about everything you did.

00:36:07.073 --> 00:36:10.627
TRAVIS: Especially if you start to admit that you
did it all yourself. I'll use Mask of Many Faces

00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:12.071
to look just like him.

00:36:12.071 --> 00:36:16.018
TALIESIN: People have got to have to start asking
questions, serious questions.

00:36:16.018 --> 00:36:23.106
MATT: You hear his head hit the stone once more.
"Who the fuck are you?"

00:36:23.106 --> 00:36:25.041
TRAVIS: (as Algar) Who the fuck are you?

00:36:25.041 --> 00:36:28.051
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.

00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:30.922
MARISHA: So badass!

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.527
TRAVIS: 19.

00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:42.410
MATT: He looks down at his severed hand, the stump
having now healed over from the healing power of

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:50.189
your prayer. "Look, please, I don't want to die. I
don't want to die down here. I don't want to wash

00:36:50.189 --> 00:36:51.852
up in the middle of the shore."

00:36:51.852 --> 00:36:56.701
TRAVIS: You know what I'm feeling like, Beau? That
I just need to get out of this city and never come

00:36:56.701 --> 00:37:01.881
back, go somewhere far away. I hold up also a
stump, because my hand is missing. I need to go,

00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:03.685
in a boat, and just go.

00:37:03.685 --> 00:37:07.608
MARISHA: Man, that sounds like a fine idea, Algar,
doesn't it?

00:37:07.608 --> 00:37:13.068
LIAM: Frumpkin starts to lovingly gnaw with his
beak on the upper chin of Algar.

00:37:13.068 --> 00:37:15.168
MATT: "That sounds like a great idea."

00:37:15.168 --> 00:37:18.822
TRAVIS: Maybe a haircut, maybe a new name, too.
What do you think?

00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:21.606
MARISHA: Oh, man. You look like a Jorge.

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:26.719
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up the severed hand
and start casting Decompose on it, too.

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:35.688
SAM: I'm going to start backing up, shaking my
head. You people are fucked up!

00:37:35.688 --> 00:37:47.164
MATT: He nods. "Right, yeah, I'll go. I'll leave
immediately. Just please let me go."

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:52.841
TRAVIS: All depends on how we decide to act as we
get out of here. I'm sure you know a very safe way

00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:54.451
to the surface, yes?

00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:59.076
MATT: "Same way I come in every day. Yeah, I'll
show you out."

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:01.327
TRAVIS: Shall we?

00:38:01.327 --> 00:38:04.159
LAURA: What do we do with him so nobody sees him?

00:38:04.159 --> 00:38:08.607
SAM: Must have a bag or something.

00:38:08.607 --> 00:38:13.939
TRAVIS: Just walk out with handless, bagged man?

00:38:13.939 --> 00:38:16.359
LAURA: Hey, Yasha, what's in your bag you've been
carrying?

00:38:16.359 --> 00:38:22.098
MATT: It's not on her; it's up in the boat you
guys had put in the water. She goes, "Mostly just

00:38:22.098 --> 00:38:25.701
"blankets and gold."

00:38:25.701 --> 00:38:27.209
LIAM: I have a cloak.

00:38:27.209 --> 00:38:32.031
SAM: Yeah, we can wrap him up in a cloak and carry
him out like we're carrying some equipment.

00:38:32.031 --> 00:38:37.440
LAURA: Okay. I mean, (southern accent) Oh, all
right. (whispering) Shit, I forgot to do the

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.230
voice. How do you remember to do that all the
time?

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.887
SAM: He doesn't, sometimes.

00:38:45.377 --> 00:38:52.296
MARISHA: Algar, you're going to be very helpful
when it comes to making sure Algar knows who to

00:38:52.528 --> 00:38:54.789
talk to and the right things to say to get us out,
right?

00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:56.193
MATT: "Right."

00:38:56.193 --> 00:38:57.948
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, Jorge.

00:38:57.948 --> 00:39:06.396
MATT: "Jorge." He's still trying to pull away from
the horrible, slow sucking of--

00:39:06.396 --> 00:39:08.300
LIAM: No, it's a beak.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.519
MATT: Oh, the tentacles wrapping around the neck,
and there's a slight biting right there.

00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:20.677
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my disguise kit and
give him a nice little beard and a mustache. And

00:39:20.677 --> 00:39:21.962
an eye patch.

00:39:21.962 --> 00:39:27.375
MATT: He sits there, held to the wall, being
chewed on by a tiny octopus, for the next 30

00:39:27.375 --> 00:39:33.172
minutes, while you roll-- Okay, roll for your
disguise kit.

00:39:33.172 --> 00:39:37.501
LAURA: I'm proficient with disguise, so I roll
with advantage, because I'm--?

00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:43.191
MATT: Not with advantage, but you get proficiency
bonus, so roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

00:39:45.506 --> 00:39:47.892
LAURA: Plus proficiency, 20.

00:39:47.892 --> 00:39:55.230
MATT: Algar looks like a weirder uncle of Algar
who could probably pass for a Jorge, sure, yeah.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:40:00.603
But he looks different, and is missing a hand, so
it's definitely not Algar.

00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:08.037
TRAVIS: Jorge, any traps, contraptions we should
be aware of as we're heading out?

00:40:08.037 --> 00:40:16.087
MATT: "No, no traps. There are some lockdown
failsafes, but it's not much help at the moment."

00:40:16.087 --> 00:40:22.535
TRAVIS: How far away is the other container for
the other, I assume, creature under the same

00:40:22.535 --> 00:40:27.922
restraints we saw here? He mentioned going to free
his compatriot?

00:40:27.922 --> 00:40:30.632
LAURA: His partner in Port Damali, Fjord.

00:40:30.632 --> 00:40:33.388
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought there were two under
Nicodranas.

00:40:33.388 --> 00:40:36.094
LAURA: I bet it's his partner in Port Damali.

00:40:36.094 --> 00:40:41.045
MATT: He gives you a look that doesn't nod, but
you can see from his recognition that you hit the

00:40:41.045 --> 00:40:43.597
nail on the head.

00:40:43.597 --> 00:40:46.157
LAURA: See? The accent, it makes me smarter.

00:40:46.157 --> 00:40:50.960
TRAVIS: I was okay with the rolling blackouts in
Nicodranas, but two cities I feel a little worse

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.046
about. A little worse. They'll figure it out.

00:40:56.046 --> 00:40:58.056
MARISHA: The whole eastern seaboard is shut down.

00:40:58.056 --> 00:41:00.826
TRAVIS: There's a mage tower that goes up and
down. This place will be fine.

00:41:00.826 --> 00:41:05.278
TALIESIN: They're over-investing in genie-based
power systems.

00:41:05.278 --> 00:41:07.270
MARISHA: Technology, yeah!

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:10.002
TRAVIS: Well, Jorge, why don't you show us the way
out?

00:41:10.002 --> 00:41:14.759
MATT: He looks to Beau to be let up, because he's
still being pressed.

00:41:14.759 --> 00:41:20.690
MARISHA: Oh, I know, it's so obnoxious when
someone has their hands on you and you don't want

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.836
it, isn't it? Okay, let's go.

00:41:22.836 --> 00:41:25.641
(laughter)

00:41:25.641 --> 00:41:31.377
MATT: He gets up. (grunts) Still looking over the
missing hand and back at the rest of you, and

00:41:31.482 --> 00:41:36.699
begins to slump his way further down the hallway
where they were heading to exit. You're following

00:41:36.699 --> 00:41:44.954
him down this path. He's using a small torch that
he lit for light to make his way down here, and as

00:41:44.954 --> 00:41:49.063
he leads you through, it opens up into a few other
small chambers that have some tables and chairs.

00:41:49.063 --> 00:41:57.631
There's a number of weapons, close-quarter smaller
weapons for any combat that may take place in a

00:41:57.631 --> 00:42:09.662
tunnel. There's a small sketch with charcoal or
some sort of a darker chalk on the wall that

00:42:09.662 --> 00:42:15.660
outlines the layout of the Sluice Weave for those
that are coming in to see where they're trying to

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.857
go and get to.

00:42:16.857 --> 00:42:19.084
LIAM: I take a good long look at it.

00:42:19.084 --> 00:42:20.806
LAURA: I draw a dick on it.

00:42:20.806 --> 00:42:24.157
LIAM: Great, now I have to remember that as well.

00:42:24.157 --> 00:42:26.837
MATT: Yeah, yeah, you do. It's part of it now.

00:42:26.837 --> 00:42:29.121
TRAVIS: Pre-dick or post-dick?

00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:36.258
LIAM: It's in. Is it in?

00:42:36.258 --> 00:42:45.127
MATT: There you go. Eventually, he leads you to a
spiral staircase that goes upwards. There are two

00:42:45.127 --> 00:42:51.717
sets of iron barred doors he has the keys to. He
opens them, leads you in. You do notice on the way

00:42:51.717 --> 00:42:58.261
through there are a couple of archways leading
from chamber to chamber where there are gated

00:42:58.261 --> 00:43:05.047
portcullis doorways that would collapse down.
There are switches on the opposite side as a means

00:43:05.047 --> 00:43:12.996
of defense if things were to go wrong to back up.
Once you have them under your control, he has no

00:43:12.996 --> 00:43:17.801
means of doing so, and you watch him very
carefully. Heading up the spiral staircase, it

00:43:17.801 --> 00:43:25.270
leads you to a trap door that a stair leads up to.
He pushes it open quietly, and it leads you into a

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:35.768
small office. It's got a small desk, it's got a
stool, it's got some odd stacks of paper, looks

00:43:35.768 --> 00:43:40.918
like there's a quill and an inkwell, a second
unopened inkwell. There's some partially melted

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:45.848
candles that aren't lit at the moment, and there
is a door that exits. He unlocks that door.

00:43:45.848 --> 00:43:51.208
TRAVIS: Just a moment. We're going to need those
keys.

00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:54.088
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the ink, too.

00:43:54.088 --> 00:43:57.790
LIAM: And rifle through the papers on the desk.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:03.418
TRAVIS: Now, I'm sure it goes without saying that
once you leave this place, if you yell, or act a

00:44:03.486 --> 00:44:09.276
fool in any way, we will tear you asunder before
you can say "Ow."

00:44:09.276 --> 00:44:14.220
MATT: "I understand."

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.729
LIAM: Do you still look like him?

00:44:15.729 --> 00:44:16.432
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:16.432 --> 00:44:19.252
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. Is this your office?

00:44:19.252 --> 00:44:21.045
MATT: "This is my office, yeah."

00:44:21.045 --> 00:44:23.215
LAURA: These people will know this is your
office?

00:44:23.215 --> 00:44:25.434
MATT: "The few that I work with, yes."

00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:28.478
LAURA: Got it. Thank you. (southern accent) I
mean, got it, thank you.

00:44:28.478 --> 00:44:32.284
SAM: Caleb, did you find anything?

00:44:32.284 --> 00:44:34.861
LIAM: I don't know, did I find anything?

00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:36.602
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:44:36.602 --> 00:44:42.040
LIAM: Ja, okay. Ooh, ten.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:51.049
MATT: You glance through quickly. A lot of it
appears to be notes on repairs, on how best to

00:44:51.456 --> 00:44:56.799
organize the time that the marid has. There is an
actual breakdown on how often it can summon

00:44:56.799 --> 00:45:02.959
elementals and control them. You find some things
that talk about a marid defense of the city,

00:45:02.959 --> 00:45:09.260
meaning there is a plan in place that if ever the
city were under attack from the sea, that it was

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:15.051
one of their secret weapons to defend the city
from ships. That's the most you can find. Those

00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:19.309
are all surface things that you see on the desk.
The rest of it doesn't seem to make much sense or

00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:21.369
pertain to anything important to you.

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:22.731
LAURA: Jorge. Sorry.

00:45:22.731 --> 00:45:24.209
TALIESIN: Go ahead. No.

00:45:24.209 --> 00:45:27.747
LAURA: Are any of these-- (southern accent) Are
any of these letters written by you?

00:45:27.747 --> 00:45:32.027
MATT: "A few of them." He points to a couple.

00:45:32.027 --> 00:45:35.735
LAURA: I'm going to take one and study it.

00:45:35.735 --> 00:45:38.053
LIAM: Are you right-handed or left-handed?

00:45:38.053 --> 00:45:40.433
MARISHA: Well, now he's right-handed.

00:45:40.433 --> 00:45:45.859
LIAM: But two hours ago, were you right-handed or
left-handed?

00:45:45.859 --> 00:45:47.995
MATT: "I was left-handed."

00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:48.797
MARISHA: Ooh.

00:45:48.797 --> 00:45:50.190
TRAVIS: That's a bitch.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.542
SAM: He'll never play piano.

00:45:51.542 --> 00:45:53.509
LAURA: Hey, I'm left-handed.

00:45:53.509 --> 00:45:59.795
TALIESIN: I'm looking for anywhere where there
might be a secret stash or something that looks

00:45:59.795 --> 00:46:04.231
off-kilter or a little odd in here, somewhere
where he might be hiding something.

00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:06.277
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:46:11.027 --> 00:46:12.931
TALIESIN: Six. No.

00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:14.327
MATT: Looks like an office.

00:46:14.327 --> 00:46:23.431
TRAVIS: What do you guys think? I feel like I need
to partake on this voyage today. Don't you think?

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.993
MARISHA: Hmm.

00:46:24.993 --> 00:46:30.140
TRAVIS: Almost ASAFP? Right?

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.208
MARISHA: The weather's kind.

00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:34.659
TRAVIS: It was a nice day earlier.

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:36.181
MARISHA: Seize the moment.

00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:39.340
LAURA: Walk him out and make sure that he gets on
the boat?

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.465
TRAVIS: You want to do that?

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:45.917
LAURA: Well, I got to write some shit in this
office, but it's up to y'all.

00:46:45.917 --> 00:46:49.740
SAM: Maybe Beau and myself could go?

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:59.326
MARISHA: Maybe our tortle friend here can leave a
little note in your stead, says that you're moving on.

00:47:00.824 --> 00:47:02.556
MATT: "That's fine."

00:47:02.556 --> 00:47:08.546
MARISHA: Are there any favorite buzzwords of
yours? Something that would sound like you?

00:47:08.546 --> 00:47:10.066
SAM: How do you normally sign letters?

00:47:10.066 --> 00:47:14.326
MARISHA: (laughing) A lodestar.

00:47:14.326 --> 00:47:19.108
SAM: Are you a "Sincerely" person, or a "Love,"
"Love, Algar?"

00:47:19.108 --> 00:47:25.208
MATT: His stare is far off in the distance. He is
looking down the barrel of a gun and a complete

00:47:25.208 --> 00:47:29.678
shift in his life that he wasn't expecting to take
immediately. His responses are very one-word and

00:47:29.678 --> 00:47:31.287
very, "No."

00:47:31.287 --> 00:47:34.050
TRAVIS: Shouldn't have been a dick.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:38.248
SAM: Well, all right. I'm sure it's probably a
"Sincerely."

00:47:38.248 --> 00:47:44.241
LIAM: It's very sad. So sad that he had to sit
down and write a letter about how he had to leave

00:47:44.241 --> 00:47:48.818
the city and how he had to free the creature
beneath the city because it was so wrong--

00:47:48.818 --> 00:47:51.999
LAURA: Don't tell him all those things. I totally
plan on doing that shit. Get out of here before

00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:52.877
talking about--

00:47:52.877 --> 00:47:54.515
LIAM: He's leaving.

00:47:54.515 --> 00:47:57.521
LAURA: (teeth clenched) Get out!

00:47:57.521 --> 00:48:00.706
MARISHA: Okay, we'll go. We'll meet up with you
guys?

00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:03.513
LAURA: Yeah, we'll see you back at the (mumble).

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:05.472
SAM: Sure, tortle.

00:48:05.472 --> 00:48:18.817
MATT: You escort him to the wharf. As a sailor,
you know specifically who to talk to to secure

00:48:18.817 --> 00:48:26.544
passage under the table. Where do you want to send
him?

00:48:26.544 --> 00:48:32.552
SAM: I don't know anything about the outside
world. Where's far?

00:48:33.133 --> 00:48:34.188
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:48:34.188 --> 00:48:35.138
TRAVIS: Where?

00:48:35.138 --> 00:48:37.329
LIAM: I was joking, I said Glintshore.

00:48:37.329 --> 00:48:41.327
MATT: (laughs) It's a good summer stay-away.

00:48:41.327 --> 00:48:42.896
LIAM: Lay out on the glass.

00:48:42.896 --> 00:48:44.448
LAURA: Somewhere in Tal'Dorei.

00:48:44.448 --> 00:48:48.775
MARISHA: Yeah. Marquet is far. It's very far.

00:48:48.775 --> 00:48:51.374
SAM: I heard a traveler talking about Whitestone.

00:48:51.374 --> 00:48:52.897
TRAVIS: I don't think it has a shore.

00:48:52.897 --> 00:48:57.160
SAM: I don't know, I just heard about it. I don't
know anything about it.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:01.072
MARISHA: There's Stilben. Which was on the coast?

00:49:01.072 --> 00:49:05.507
MATT: Yeah, that's one of the major coastal cities
on the eastern side of Tal'Dorei.

00:49:05.507 --> 00:49:08.855
LIAM: I hear Opash has a sweet Airbnb on an
island.

00:49:08.855 --> 00:49:09.879
TRAVIS: Let's send him to Marquet.

00:49:09.879 --> 00:49:11.816
MARISHA: Marquet! Marquet it is.

00:49:11.816 --> 00:49:13.358
SAM: That's where Adella's going.

00:49:13.358 --> 00:49:15.006
TRAVIS: There you go.

00:49:15.006 --> 00:49:19.345
MATT: All right. Because it's a longer journey,
it's a little more expensive, but you can secure

00:49:19.345 --> 00:49:24.475
passage for him to Marquet for, we'll say, 20
gold.

00:49:24.475 --> 00:49:26.735
MARISHA: I'll sponsor that journey.

00:49:26.735 --> 00:49:27.938
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:49:27.938 --> 00:49:32.616
LAURA: Want to give him a little spending cash?
Make sure he's not completely destitute when he

00:49:32.616 --> 00:49:33.813
gets there.

00:49:33.813 --> 00:49:35.235
TALIESIN: That seems nice.

00:49:35.235 --> 00:49:37.164
MARISHA: Did we take the money that was on him?

00:49:37.164 --> 00:49:39.452
SAM: I may have taken the money that was on him.

00:49:39.452 --> 00:49:42.474
TRAVIS: You want to put back one of those
platinums?

00:49:42.474 --> 00:49:51.558
SAM: Sure. Here you go, Jorge. Here's one
platinum.

00:49:51.558 --> 00:49:54.193
MATT: "This is very kind of you."

00:49:54.193 --> 00:49:55.148
SAM: And five copper.

00:49:55.148 --> 00:50:00.363
(laughter)

00:50:00.363 --> 00:50:04.657
MATT: The beard's peeling a little bit. He's just
staring at the coin in his palm.

00:50:05.088 --> 00:50:07.221
TRAVIS: Let me get that part. (slap)

00:50:07.221 --> 00:50:09.345
MARISHA: God, we're mean.

00:50:09.345 --> 00:50:14.139
LAURA: He was a bad person. We didn't kill him.

00:50:14.139 --> 00:50:16.559
TALIESIN: No, you let him live. That's really
nice.

00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:18.131
MARISHA: Thanks, Deuce.

00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:24.525
SAM: We're going to try and take him to Adella or
just any boat?

00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:25.507
TRAVIS: Any boat.

00:50:25.507 --> 00:50:32.466
MATT: Adella leaves in little under a week. You
can secure passage today on a small ship that's

00:50:32.466 --> 00:50:39.917
heading back to Marquet. You send him off on his
way. You wait another hour or so to make sure the

00:50:39.917 --> 00:50:49.440
ship disembarks and he doesn't abscond from the
ship itself. You watch as it begins to make its

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.655
way towards the horizon and you feel confident
that he's not going to be coming back anytime soon.

00:50:54.178 --> 00:50:58.534
TRAVIS: That ring of keys that he gave us:
approximately how many keys are on that thing?

00:50:58.534 --> 00:50:59.439
MATT: Eight.

00:50:59.439 --> 00:51:08.560
LAURA: I need to write a letter about-- okay, what
should I say? "I hate this city, I want everyone

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.594
"to suffer what I feel in my heart?"

00:51:11.594 --> 00:51:12.770
LIAM: "I'm sick of you people pushing me
around--"

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:19.159
LAURA: "I'm sick of all you people pushing me
around, I'm freeing this djinn and I'm setting

00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:22.936
sail for another land." How about all of that?

00:51:22.936 --> 00:51:30.184
TRAVIS: Yes. And, "I plan to betray all of the
city's secrets to your foes if I ever return.

00:51:30.506 --> 00:51:33.122
"It'll be very smart to kill me on sight."

00:51:33.122 --> 00:51:37.143
(laughter)

00:51:37.143 --> 00:51:38.392
LAURA: That's probably good.

00:51:38.392 --> 00:51:40.956
LIAM: It's maybe-- it's gilding the lily,
perhaps.

00:51:40.956 --> 00:51:47.818
LAURA: Okay, well. What if I just write "Ha ha ha,
I'm so glad you guys are going to suffer, I got

00:51:47.818 --> 00:51:49.796
"away scot free."

00:51:49.796 --> 00:51:54.086
LIAM: Lots of middle fingers, you'll never catch
me alive, your city is shit.

00:51:54.086 --> 00:51:58.534
SAM: "I'm going to burn all of my fellow guards
with a large Fireball first."

00:51:58.534 --> 00:52:02.159
(laughter)

00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:03.871
LIAM: We can take care of the guards.

00:52:03.871 --> 00:52:07.511
SAM: They're going find some charred bodies and
stuff--

00:52:07.511 --> 00:52:10.787
LAURA: If the djinn got away, then maybe the djinn
did it.

00:52:10.787 --> 00:52:12.563
LIAM: A water creature?

00:52:12.563 --> 00:52:15.978
SAM: How'd that fire happen, though?

00:52:15.978 --> 00:52:19.531
MATT: Here's a question. Did you dismiss your
specter, or do you have a--

00:52:19.531 --> 00:52:21.047
TRAVIS: I didn't dismiss it.

00:52:21.047 --> 00:52:23.021
MATT: As you guys are--

00:52:23.021 --> 00:52:25.598
MARISHA: It's just running around in terror.

00:52:25.598 --> 00:52:33.510
MATT: As you're leaving the area, right behind you
is this (ghostly groaning). What do you do with it?

00:52:33.888 --> 00:52:35.514
TRAVIS: You mean as we go outside outside?

00:52:35.514 --> 00:52:37.340
MATT: Yeah. It's following you.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.364
TRAVIS: Go back inside the room!

00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:45.893
MATT: You guys begin to watch as that same drowned
specter is now coming back behind you (groaning)

00:52:45.893 --> 00:52:48.267
TALIESIN: Oh god! I Turn Undead.

00:52:48.267 --> 00:52:51.214
MATT: It turns right around and runs off a bit.

00:52:51.214 --> 00:52:54.941
SAM: Wait. Turn Undead really just turns an undead
around?

00:52:54.941 --> 00:52:56.508
TALIESIN: Yes. It's Turn Undead.

00:52:56.508 --> 00:52:58.690
MATT: It's frightened of him and runs away.

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:01.167
LIAM: It's like a remote control car that spins.

00:53:01.167 --> 00:53:05.408
LAURA: Unless you're high enough level, and then
it (pop).

00:53:05.408 --> 00:53:08.720
TALIESIN: I'm not quite at the pop-it. It's too
strong for me to pop, right?

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.061
MATT: Correct. It doesn't last a long while. A
short time passes and it just--

00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:17.003
LAURA: So I'm writing this letter? And I'm leaving
it in his office, yeah?

00:53:17.003 --> 00:53:19.309
LIAM: Yeah we're still in the office, are we not?

00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:23.433
MARISHA: Technically we left. You three are
here.

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:27.278
LIAM: While Jester is writing, I would like to
flip this office for anything of value.

00:53:27.278 --> 00:53:28.972
MATT: You already have.

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.223
LIAM: Oh, just the papers?

00:53:30.223 --> 00:53:32.022
MATT: Well, you checked around for anything that
would be interesting, so--

00:53:32.022 --> 00:53:32.924
LIAM: Excellent.

00:53:32.924 --> 00:53:36.258
TALIESIN: Well, I have a thought.

00:53:36.258 --> 00:53:37.656
LAURA: What?

00:53:37.656 --> 00:53:43.996
TALIESIN: What if he accidentally lost control of
the creature and then ran--

00:53:43.996 --> 00:53:44.742
MATT: (groaning noises)

00:53:44.742 --> 00:53:46.664
TALIESIN: Ah! Turn Undead.

00:53:46.664 --> 00:53:48.062
(laughter)

00:53:48.062 --> 00:53:49.806
MATT: How many Channel Divinities can you do?

00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:53.276
TALIESIN: I might be out. I was about to say--
don't I have-- I might be out.

00:53:53.276 --> 00:54:00.322
MATT: I feel like you were out last time. We'll
say you took a short rest, but-- It's wandered

00:54:00.322 --> 00:54:03.509
back in the chamber and it's looking at Fjord.
(groaning)

00:54:03.509 --> 00:54:05.024
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I'm out.

00:54:05.024 --> 00:54:09.390
LAURA: Do we have two Channel Divinities or just
one at this level? Then I Turn Undead!

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:10.708
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:54:10.708 --> 00:54:14.213
MATT: Turns around and starts walking away.

00:54:14.213 --> 00:54:17.098
MARISHA: I really feel like you could do something
about this!

00:54:17.098 --> 00:54:21.419
TALIESIN: Maybe he ran away because doesn't want
to be held accountable for his actions?

00:54:21.419 --> 00:54:27.325
LAURA: Oh, that's true. What do you guys think?
Okay. Deuce has a really good idea. Maybe instead

00:54:27.325 --> 00:54:31.936
of we say, "Go fuck yourself," and all of that,
what if we say-- It's really strong, we have this

00:54:31.936 --> 00:54:34.295
version of his letter right here.

00:54:34.295 --> 00:54:35.233
LIAM: Draft number two.

00:54:35.233 --> 00:54:41.489
LAURA: Draft number two. "Oh no, I lost control of
the genie, and now I am so scared I'm running away."

00:54:42.116 --> 00:54:47.083
TALIESIN: He strikes me as the sort of person who
doesn't want to be held responsible--

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:49.552
LIAM: If you were fleeing in terror, would you
stop to write a letter?

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:55.143
TALIESIN: That might be his attempt to say, "I did
this, I'm sorry, bye" kind of thing.

00:54:55.143 --> 00:54:57.579
TRAVIS: Remember, we don't want anybody to like
him when he comes back.

00:54:57.579 --> 00:54:59.406
TALIESIN: Well, they're not, there are people dead
down there.

00:54:59.406 --> 00:55:02.306
MATT: (ghostly groaning) The specter returns as
you guys are having this conversation.

00:55:02.306 --> 00:55:06.214
LAURA: Ah! I can't do anything! I try to attack
it.

00:55:06.214 --> 00:55:08.960
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an attack
roll.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.374
LAURA: I'll Sacred Flame him.

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:12.725
MATT: Okay.

00:55:12.725 --> 00:55:16.116
MARISHA: Do you guys remember in Tomb Raider 2 the
butler that you had?

00:55:16.116 --> 00:55:18.565
MATT: That's 12, so it takes damage. That's
basically what this is!

00:55:18.565 --> 00:55:26.522
LAURA: Oh! That's 11. 11 radiant damage.

00:55:26.522 --> 00:55:32.348
MATT: 11 points of radiant damage. All right.
(impact, groaning)

00:55:32.348 --> 00:55:33.871
TALIESIN: Oh god, Sacred Flame.

00:55:33.871 --> 00:55:36.976
MATT: Success.

00:55:38.382 --> 00:55:39.937
TALIESIN: Three points.

00:55:39.937 --> 00:55:41.813
MATT: It's not attacking anyone.

00:55:41.813 --> 00:55:42.827
LAURA: Oh, it's not?

00:55:42.827 --> 00:55:46.124
MATT: It's not assaulting you guys. It's just
standing there and taking the hits and looking in

00:55:46.124 --> 00:55:51.278
pain. It keeps looking for Fjord.
(ghostly groaning)

00:55:51.278 --> 00:55:52.413
TRAVIS: You can go.

00:55:52.413 --> 00:55:57.001
MATT: It disperses into shadow and vanishes.

00:55:57.001 --> 00:55:58.383
MARISHA: We're time jumping.

00:55:58.383 --> 00:56:05.748
SAM: Me and Marisha are took Jorge to the docks
with the promise that Fjord would come later and

00:56:05.748 --> 00:56:06.442
join us.

00:56:06.442 --> 00:56:09.044
LIAM: But he was the one that had all the sailor
tricks to get the boat!

00:56:09.044 --> 00:56:13.576
MATT: This was me realizing that this is what
would have happened earlier, so we're taking care

00:56:13.576 --> 00:56:17.327
of it now. Okay? Because this would have been
following-- I forgot about the specter briefly

00:56:17.327 --> 00:56:19.061
earlier, and this would have happened.

00:56:19.061 --> 00:56:22.476
TALIESIN: I like that just takes responsibility
for everything that happened down there.

00:56:22.476 --> 00:56:25.121
LAURA: I like it better when he's saying, "Fuck
yourself."

00:56:25.121 --> 00:56:26.561
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair, too.

00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:31.390
MATT: I appreciate that they've completely glossed
over this scenario.

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:32.992
TALIESIN: That's very fair, yeah.

00:56:32.992 --> 00:56:37.732
LAURA: I think we should stick with the
go-fuck-yourself version and say "I

00:56:37.732 --> 00:56:43.037
intentionally--" he intentionally let him go, and
he knew that he was going to fuck over the city

00:56:43.037 --> 00:56:43.966
and run.

00:56:43.966 --> 00:56:46.984
LIAM: I agree with you, Jester, I think we should
stick with "Go fuck yourself."

00:56:46.984 --> 00:56:49.024
LAURA: Okay. Sincerely--

00:56:49.024 --> 00:56:51.947
SAM: I mean, I don't know if I'm really here right
now, so.

00:56:51.947 --> 00:56:54.989
MATT: We'll say that you guys are all together.

00:56:54.989 --> 00:56:56.205
SAM: Okay, that sounds good.

00:56:56.205 --> 00:56:59.291
TRAVIS: Christ, it's a letter; just fucking write
it and send it.

00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:02.474
LAURA: I'm leaving it in the office, Fjord.

00:57:02.474 --> 00:57:03.123
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:57:03.123 --> 00:57:06.219
LIAM: Maybe something like, choke upon your woe.

00:57:06.219 --> 00:57:08.634
LAURA: Choke upon your woe!

00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:11.244
LIAM: Or eat fecal matters.

00:57:11.244 --> 00:57:14.620
LAURA: Or eat fecal matter, question mark? Signed
Algar.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.277
(laughter)

00:57:17.277 --> 00:57:21.033
MATT: Go ahead and roll for your forgery kit.

00:57:21.033 --> 00:57:22.098
LAURA: With proficiency.

00:57:22.098 --> 00:57:24.742
MATT: With proficiency, so d20 plus-- I'll say
this is for intelligence--

00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:29.385
SAM: Do you want to look at the dodecahedron
first?

00:57:29.385 --> 00:57:31.351
LAURA: Oh yeah! I do, I do!

00:57:31.351 --> 00:57:35.567
SAM: Before you write this letter, let's time jump
again. Before you write the letter--

00:57:35.567 --> 00:57:36.618
LAURA: I focus.

00:57:36.618 --> 00:57:39.386
MATT: Okay, so you have a fragment of
possibility.

00:57:39.386 --> 00:57:42.440
LAURA: Depending on how I roll, I can roll again?

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:43.899
LIAM: Take a hit of the dodec.

00:57:43.899 --> 00:57:48.720
LAURA: Ooh! That's dexterity plus proficiency?

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.326
MATT: I'm saying, because it's a forgery and it's
having to pay attention to details, I'm going to

00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:55.715
say intellect. Intelligence.

00:57:55.715 --> 00:57:56.861
LAURA: Really?

00:57:56.861 --> 00:57:57.577
MATT: Yeah.

00:57:57.577 --> 00:57:58.578
LIAM: Did you roll twice?

00:57:58.578 --> 00:58:00.709
LAURA: No, I didn't roll twice. Okay.

00:58:00.709 --> 00:58:02.878
MATT: You don't have to roll twice. You don't have
to spend it if you don't want it.

00:58:02.878 --> 00:58:09.889
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to spend it, just in case.
Proficiency bonus is just your initiative? Where's

00:58:09.889 --> 00:58:11.467
your proficiency?

00:58:11.467 --> 00:58:12.959
MATT: Plus three, I think?

00:58:12.959 --> 00:58:14.395
LAURA: So 22.

00:58:14.395 --> 00:58:18.203
MATT: 22. Pretty good forgery. You're proud of
yourself. It looks pretty spot-on based on his

00:58:18.203 --> 00:58:24.128
handwriting. You've followed his cadence, his
sentence structure. His signature looks incredible.

00:58:24.128 --> 00:58:26.070
SAM: The dicks look like his dicks.

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:28.329
TALIESIN: I'm impressed by the dicks, actually.

00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:31.701
LAURA: Thank you, thank you. All right, I'm
leaving this on his desk.

00:58:31.701 --> 00:58:34.242
SAM: Should you put it on the door with like a
dagger?

00:58:34.242 --> 00:58:34.929
LAURA: Ooh!

00:58:34.929 --> 00:58:36.419
TALIESIN: With his dagger.

00:58:36.419 --> 00:58:41.619
SAM: With his-- I left his dagger. Shit. I could
go back down the hall and get it?

00:58:41.619 --> 00:58:46.742
LAURA: No. I'll just maybe tape it.

00:58:46.742 --> 00:58:49.864
SAM: I have extra daggers, do you want a dagger? I
have three extra daggers.

00:58:49.864 --> 00:58:51.838
TALIESIN: Oh, he had a quill, didn't he?

00:58:51.838 --> 00:58:52.683
MATT: Yeah.

00:58:52.683 --> 00:58:54.546
LAURA: With a quill!

00:58:54.546 --> 00:58:56.515
SAM: Yeah! Through the paper.

00:58:56.515 --> 00:58:59.238
MATT: I'll say with your strength you can easily
do so. It will break the quill, technically, but

00:58:59.238 --> 00:59:01.789
it still pierces it to the door. There you go.

00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:03.838
LIAM: Angry writer.

00:59:03.838 --> 00:59:05.904
LAURA: It's pretty threatening, it's a feather.

00:59:05.904 --> 00:59:10.567
MATT: Cool, so the letter is complete and placed.

00:59:10.567 --> 00:59:15.186
LAURA: Should we go down and escape the other way
so nobody sees-- Oh, I guess you guys already left.

00:59:15.467 --> 00:59:19.855
SAM: We already left. We're taking Jorge to the
docks, right?

00:59:19.855 --> 00:59:21.937
TRAVIS: No, we're all back together now.

00:59:21.937 --> 00:59:23.981
SAM: Did we go to the docks?

00:59:23.981 --> 00:59:32.019
MATT: Yes, we're-- Okay. This is my fault for
forgetting one feature earlier and trying to fit

00:59:32.019 --> 00:59:38.647
it into the narrative here. Order of business! You
arrived, you forged a letter--

00:59:38.647 --> 00:59:39.720
LAURA: We forged it!

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:44.465
MATT: You saw a weird undead thing again that was
following you and then Fjord made it go away with

00:59:44.465 --> 00:59:49.836
a hand wave. You then took Jorge to the docks and
sent him on his way.

00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:51.844
SAM: Great! Now where are we? On the docks?

00:59:51.844 --> 00:59:54.762
MATT: You guys are near the docks, you've made
your way out.

00:59:58.382 --> 01:00:01.184
SAM: What do we do with Jorge? I'm kidding!

01:00:01.184 --> 01:00:04.892
(laughter)

01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:08.640
TRAVIS: Well, I feel like that kind of went about
as well as it could have.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.449
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:00:09.449 --> 01:00:12.138
TALIESIN: I think I should go get the boat.

01:00:12.138 --> 01:00:13.100
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.100
TALIESIN: I'm going to head towards where we
anchored the boat.

01:00:18.387 --> 01:00:23.625
MATT: Okay. It's still there floating. You can see
there's one fisherman who's eyeing it curiously.

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:28.012
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Calm Emotions on
myself and go swim to the boat.

01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:36.017
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and make your way out,
get up on the side of it, and begin to row

01:00:36.017 --> 01:00:44.902
yourself back to the edge of the dock. There, not
far away, is the old fisherman you had spoken to

01:00:44.902 --> 01:00:50.130
earlier that you had borrowed it from. You gather
your things out of it and he comes over and is

01:00:50.257 --> 01:00:54.522
like, "Well, I appreciate you bringing this
back."

01:00:54.522 --> 01:01:00.048
TALIESIN: It's no problem. I think I've had enough
ocean for a while. That was--

01:01:00.048 --> 01:01:03.575
MATT: "No such thing. No such thing!'"

01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:04.979
TALIESIN: Have a good day!

01:01:04.979 --> 01:01:07.293
MATT: "You too, tall one."

01:01:10.221 --> 01:01:12.427
TRAVIS: What do we do now?

01:01:12.427 --> 01:01:21.832
MARISHA: I turn around and I look at the city. Do
I notice... commerce? Does it look like things are

01:01:21.832 --> 01:01:22.628
slowing down?

01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:24.566
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:01:24.566 --> 01:01:26.654
LIAM: Are we now Bane?

01:01:26.939 --> 01:01:32.098
MARISHA: Well, that was a garbage roll. Seven.
That's terrible.

01:01:32.098 --> 01:01:36.050
MATT: It looks like the city. I mean, at this
point in the day, it's getting a little later. The

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:44.277
sky is starting to get a bit-- maybe the oranges
of dusk are starting to peek in a little bit. You

01:01:44.277 --> 01:01:47.483
maybe have another hour or so of daylight.

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.701
MARISHA: Do I see Merpol anywhere?

01:01:50.701 --> 01:01:52.603
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:01:55.374 --> 01:01:56.637
TRAVIS: See who?

01:01:56.637 --> 01:02:01.105
MARISHA: Merpol, that guy that I flirted with.
11.

01:02:01.105 --> 01:02:03.236
MATT: Currently, no. You don't see him anywhere.

01:02:03.236 --> 01:02:06.318
MARISHA: Thank god. All right.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:14.175
SAM: We could go back to Jester's mom and report.
We could go to that tower and investigate it.

01:02:14.175 --> 01:02:15.358
TRAVIS: We could do both.

01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:16.410
SAM: We could.

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:18.663
TALIESIN: I'll admit, I'm a little tired.

01:02:18.663 --> 01:02:20.163
LAURA: That's true.

01:02:20.163 --> 01:02:21.721
TALIESIN: That was a lot.

01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:30.122
MARISHA: We also wanted to check in to... Did we
want to try and be at the docks at midnight?

01:02:30.592 --> 01:02:32.726
SAM: Oh, to meet Marius?

01:02:32.726 --> 01:02:40.975
MARISHA: Yes. He hangs out at the docks at
midnight, and does Marius know Sabian and Cadmus?

01:02:40.975 --> 01:02:43.074
LIAM: That's unclear at this point, isn't it?

01:02:43.074 --> 01:02:44.495
MATT: Yeah, you don't know.

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:47.358
LIAM: Do you have that letter, by the way? Who has
that?

01:02:47.358 --> 01:02:49.074
MARISHA: The letter?

01:02:49.074 --> 01:02:51.142
LIAM: The letter that mentions Marius LePual.

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:54.906
LAURA: Is he there every midnight or just tonight
midnight?

01:02:54.906 --> 01:02:56.412
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:02:56.412 --> 01:03:01.582
LAURA: Because if we wait until tomorrow, I can
Zone of Truth him.

01:03:01.582 --> 01:03:07.957
MARISHA: Orly said he likes to hang out around the
docks at midnight to look for work or something.

01:03:07.957 --> 01:03:10.996
LIAM: Caleb would've remembered that, too. I
don't, though.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:16.102
MATT: Yeah. I mean, occasionally he's out there
looking for work. That's as much as Orly knew.

01:03:16.102 --> 01:03:18.013
TRAVIS: Sabian was?

01:03:18.013 --> 01:03:20.337
MATT: Marius.

01:03:20.337 --> 01:03:26.825
MARISHA: Sabian we've heard about through Orly,
right?

01:03:26.825 --> 01:03:30.360
MATT: No, Sabian you heard about through Fjord.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.523
MARISHA: Through what?

01:03:31.523 --> 01:03:32.653
TRAVIS: Me.

01:03:32.653 --> 01:03:36.430
MARISHA: Yeah, but didn't we talk to like Captain
Adella and someone else? Someone gave us the news--

01:03:36.532 --> 01:03:38.761
MATT: You got some information about Sabian, yes.

01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:41.318
MARISHA: That they were doing the Widow's Embrace
thing and that they're pirates.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.227
MATT: Yeah, that was through Captain Adella.

01:03:43.227 --> 01:03:45.587
MARISHA: That was through Adella, okay. Okay,
okay, okay, sorry.

01:03:45.587 --> 01:03:47.279
TRAVIS: Let's make our way back towards the--

01:03:47.279 --> 01:03:49.099
(under his breath) Jesus Christ.

01:03:49.099 --> 01:03:50.539
MARISHA: Lavish Chateau.

01:03:50.808 --> 01:03:54.700
TRAVIS: Yep. I've got to take more organized
notes. Maybe we can stop by the fancy tower on the

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.385
way back?

01:03:56.385 --> 01:04:01.106
LIAM: I am very interested in that tower, but I
would love to ask some more questions around town

01:04:01.106 --> 01:04:04.131
before assailing it.

01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:06.465
TRAVIS: Sure. About what time is it?

01:04:06.465 --> 01:04:09.338
MATT: It's close to dusk. About an hour of
daylight left.

01:04:09.338 --> 01:04:11.212
TRAVIS: Right, you said that.

01:04:11.212 --> 01:04:14.445
SAM: Do we go towards the Lavish Chateau?

01:04:14.445 --> 01:04:16.186
LAURA: Yeah, let's go tell Mama what we did!

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.381
SAM: Yeah!

01:04:17.381 --> 01:04:21.842
MARISHA: We'll go to the Lavish Chateau and we'll
just walk by the tower on our way back to give it

01:04:21.842 --> 01:04:23.814
another look-see.

01:04:23.814 --> 01:04:28.927
MATT: Okay. It's a little bit of a roundabout
walk, but you can do it. All right, so you make

01:04:28.927 --> 01:04:37.147
your way back to the Open Quay. Heading towards
the tower, you can see, as you approach, based on

01:04:37.147 --> 01:04:45.092
whatever illusory enchantment finds your vision,
you can see as it seems to grow the closer you get

01:04:45.092 --> 01:04:50.758
to it, to the point where it's massively towering
when you're right below it. Still no sign of a

01:04:50.758 --> 01:04:59.219
door, at first glance. You still have the
20-foot-up or so balcony and a few other windows

01:04:59.219 --> 01:05:03.691
up that way. You can see the top two windows have,
now that it's gotten darker, you can there's a

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:07.360
little bit of a firelight glow at the very top of
it.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.899
LIAM: Have I ever read about anything like this? A
building that seems to shift in size.

01:05:11.899 --> 01:05:14.307
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:05:15.844 --> 01:05:20.696
LAURA: Can I look around and see if the city seems
like it's being affected at all by the no power?

01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:24.786
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:26.642
LIAM: Ten.

01:05:26.642 --> 01:05:33.089
MATT: Ten? You assume it's either some sort of
spatial enchantment to it, or it's an illusion,

01:05:33.089 --> 01:05:35.637
maybe. That's as much as you can make out from
it.

01:05:35.637 --> 01:05:36.856
LIAM: Okay.

01:05:36.856 --> 01:05:38.421
LAURA: (whispering) Natural 20.

01:05:38.421 --> 01:05:43.754
MATT: Natural 20. The city doesn't appear to be
heavily changed by any means--

01:05:43.754 --> 01:05:45.996
LAURA: I think it's fine.

01:05:45.996 --> 01:05:55.240
MATT: You do notice that, where previously there
were some plumes of white smoke or steam that rose

01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:06.495
from certain, more industrial aspects of the city,
are much thinner, appearing to be more residual

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:09.725
columns of steam and smoke.

01:06:09.725 --> 01:06:11.456
LAURA: Oh God, oh God, oh God.

01:06:11.456 --> 01:06:13.027
SAM: We'll be fine.

01:06:13.027 --> 01:06:15.228
TRAVIS: No bigs.

01:06:15.228 --> 01:06:23.674
MATT: You're at the tower. The Tide Peak Tower.
Anything you want to do?

01:06:23.674 --> 01:06:26.185
TRAVIS: I'm tapped. I can't do anything.

01:06:26.185 --> 01:06:29.788
SAM: You boys just wanted to come look at the
tower again because you like it?

01:06:29.788 --> 01:06:31.658
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:06:31.658 --> 01:06:33.992
LIAM: Don't look at me.

01:06:33.992 --> 01:06:39.337
MARISHA: I mean, kind of. We wanted to see if it
changed, or if anything's different, or if we see

01:06:39.337 --> 01:06:41.750
a mysterious figure in a window.

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:43.386
SAM: There's no windows.

01:06:43.386 --> 01:06:46.039
TRAVIS: It doesn't bother you that it grows taller
as you get closer?

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:47.148
SAM: It's pretty freaky.

01:06:47.148 --> 01:06:48.097
TRAVIS: No doors.

01:06:48.097 --> 01:06:53.920
LIAM: Oh, it's fascinating. We learned that
whoever owns this place owns the district, isn't

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.779
that correct?

01:06:54.779 --> 01:06:56.003
MATT: Yep.

01:06:56.003 --> 01:06:59.720
LIAM: So someone in this district probably knows
something about the person who owns the district.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.152
MARISHA: It's Yussa Errennis, right?

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:03.946
MATT: Yussa Errennis.

01:07:03.946 --> 01:07:05.508
SAM: Hey, Caleb!

01:07:05.508 --> 01:07:06.428
LIAM: Yeah?

01:07:06.428 --> 01:07:10.230
SAM: You memorized the map of the underground
pathways, right?

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:11.166
LIAM: Correct.

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.376
SAM: Do any of them run under this tower?

01:07:13.376 --> 01:07:16.644
LIAM: Well, there was no marking for a tower.

01:07:16.644 --> 01:07:20.729
SAM: Using your spatial, Beautiful Mind
techniques.

01:07:20.729 --> 01:07:22.369
LIAM: No idea.

01:07:22.602 --> 01:07:28.758
MATT: Make an intelligence check to see if you can
overlay the memory of the sketch you saw with the

01:07:28.758 --> 01:07:30.616
location in the Quay.

01:07:30.616 --> 01:07:32.509
LIAM: Just raw intelligence?

01:07:32.509 --> 01:07:34.184
MATT: Yep.

01:07:35.568 --> 01:07:37.104
LIAM: That is a 16.

01:07:37.104 --> 01:07:43.940
MATT: 16. You feel like you've been able to take
the two and map them together pretty well. Nothing

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:52.147
passes directly beneath the tower, no. The Sluice
isn't a wide network. It's a handful of

01:07:52.147 --> 01:07:58.799
deliberately placed tunnels to make their way
towards specific parts of different districts.

01:07:58.799 --> 01:08:02.069
LIAM: That diagram wasn't elaborate enough for me
to know the answer to that.

01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:05.363
MARISHA: Okay. Let's go to the Lavish Chateau?

01:08:05.363 --> 01:08:07.323
SAM: Mm-hmm.

01:08:07.323 --> 01:08:12.224
MATT: All right. By the time you make it to the
Lavish Chateau, it is sunset. The last bit of

01:08:12.224 --> 01:08:17.526
light that vanishes over the horizon far over the
ocean, the Lucidian Ocean in the distance. You

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:24.320
make your way to the interior, where a number of
folks have finally gathered. Maybe a handful, six

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:31.617
or seven people, are already in there enjoying
meals, having drinks. You know that there isn't a

01:08:31.617 --> 01:08:37.593
performance tonight, but people are in there
enjoying the relatively, comparably classy

01:08:37.593 --> 01:08:44.303
atmosphere, as the familiar band plays their
music. What do you want to do?

01:08:44.303 --> 01:08:47.608
LAURA: I also used another Disguise Self spell to
make sure I stay--

01:08:47.608 --> 01:08:49.287
MATT: Good call.

01:08:49.287 --> 01:08:51.591
LAURA: Tortley.

01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:53.844
SAM: Are we just here to see your mom?

01:08:53.844 --> 01:08:56.684
LAURA: Yeah, probably should tell her.

01:08:56.684 --> 01:08:58.107
LIAM: I spiffed up my clothing again, as well.

01:08:58.107 --> 01:08:59.956
MATT: Okay.

01:08:59.956 --> 01:09:03.015
SAM: How do we get upstairs with you all tortley?

01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:04.946
LAURA: Just go upstairs.

01:09:04.946 --> 01:09:08.796
SAM: All right. Let's go upstairs.

01:09:08.796 --> 01:09:11.107
LAURA: Okay, I go upstairs.

01:09:11.107 --> 01:09:21.386
MATT: All right. You guys make your way up to the
third flight. You missed him last time, but you

01:09:21.386 --> 01:09:28.367
come upon the familiar sight, to you, which was
your mother's personal bodyguard for half of the

01:09:28.367 --> 01:09:32.950
time at the Chateau, Bluude.

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:34.903
LAURA: Bluude!

01:09:34.903 --> 01:09:40.128
MATT: Which was also responsible at times to watch
you and escort you when you went to the city. The

01:09:40.128 --> 01:09:45.060
rest of you are caught off-guard by the sight of
this massive, dual-horned minotaur.

01:09:45.222 --> 01:09:46.851
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:09:46.851 --> 01:09:58.380
MATT: Wearing a very, very fine shirt, but is
Donald Ducking it the rest of the way. Thankfully,

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:04.461
relatively thick, thick fur down there. You'd have
to pry to get a good look. But is standing there,

01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:12.361
arms crossed, and goes, "Oh, Jester!" He comes
over and picks you up... Actually, no, he wouldn't

01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:15.929
recognize you because you're a tortle.

01:10:15.929 --> 01:10:18.819
LAURA: Doesn't he know that I am Jester, still?

01:10:18.872 --> 01:10:21.438
MATT: Probably not. Not unless you say anything.

01:10:21.438 --> 01:10:26.983
LAURA: Bluude, it's me!

01:10:28.643 --> 01:10:32.907
MATT: Now we go into the "Oh, Jester!" There we
go, that's the moment.

01:10:33.299 --> 01:10:35.290
LAURA: My tortle eyebrows are going like this.

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:36.927
MATT: Right, right.

01:10:36.927 --> 01:10:39.162
LIAM: This one's name is Bluute?

01:10:39.162 --> 01:10:40.929
LAURA: His name is Bluude.

01:10:40.929 --> 01:10:42.594
LIAM: Not Bluute, but Bluude?

01:10:42.594 --> 01:10:43.466
MATT: With a D.

01:10:43.466 --> 01:10:45.153
LIAM: With a D, okay.

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:48.040
LAURA: We're here to see Mama.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:55.476
MATT: "Of course, I assume that is the case." He
knocks on the door. At that point, the door opens

01:10:55.476 --> 01:11:02.412
up a bit and peeking through is the Ruby of the
Sea, Marion, whose hair is perfectly curled, even

01:11:02.412 --> 01:11:09.187
without an evening performance. She smiles at the
sight of all of you at the door and looks

01:11:09.187 --> 01:11:13.822
curiously at the large skirt-faring tortle.

01:11:15.278 --> 01:11:16.659
"Hello?"

01:11:16.659 --> 01:11:18.812
LAURA: Hi! Do you have company?

01:11:18.812 --> 01:11:20.647
MATT: "Not at the moment, no."

01:11:20.647 --> 01:11:23.389
LAURA: Can we come in and talk to you for just a
second?

01:11:23.389 --> 01:11:28.968
MATT: "Oh, Jester! Hi! Yeah, please, do come
inside, everyone. Come on." You all make your way

01:11:28.968 --> 01:11:30.940
into the chamber.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.397
LAURA: I'll drop the disguise spell once we're
inside.

01:11:33.397 --> 01:11:37.896
MATT: Okay. She shoos out her servants, and the
door closes.

01:11:37.896 --> 01:11:42.334
SAM: Oh! This is Yasha. Has she met Yasha?

01:11:42.334 --> 01:11:44.020
LAURA: (whispering) This is Yasha.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:48.266
MATT: She has not. She's like, "Oh, my goodness!
It is so nice to meet you, Yasha." She shakes her

01:11:48.266 --> 01:11:57.682
hand and Yasha awkwardly, "Hi," and looks to the
rest of you and leans towards the back wall and

01:11:57.682 --> 01:12:06.049
crosses her arms. Not one for social graces,
necessarily, but seemingly looking at Marion,

01:12:06.049 --> 01:12:12.447
looking at Jester, looking at Marion, and can see
the relation. Marion sits down in front of her

01:12:12.447 --> 01:12:23.501
mirror and her little table set up in the corner,
spins back towards the rest of you. "Welcome back.

01:12:23.501 --> 01:12:29.460
There is no performance tonight, I apologize, but
if you would like us to provide food for you or

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.800
whatever you like, please, do not bother to let me
know."

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.983
LAURA: So, you know that guy?

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:41.316
MATT: "There are a number of guys that I know,
yes."

01:12:41.316 --> 01:12:42.675
LAURA: The guy that was bugging you.

01:12:42.675 --> 01:12:43.971
MATT: "Algar, yes."

01:12:43.971 --> 01:12:46.452
LAURA: We went to go talk to him, but he had
already left.

01:12:46.452 --> 01:12:48.058
MATT: "He left?"

01:12:48.058 --> 01:12:52.103
LAURA: Yes, he had fled the city, apparently.
Things happened, they were real bad or something,

01:12:52.103 --> 01:12:53.776
I don't know.

01:12:53.776 --> 01:13:03.711
MATT: "Huh. Well, that may very well be a great
turn of luck in my benefit, definitely. Thank you

01:13:03.711 --> 01:13:05.369
for looking into that."

01:13:05.369 --> 01:13:09.461
LAURA: Of course! Yeah, we were going to talk to
him and everything, but he is gone, so...

01:13:10.403 --> 01:13:16.126
MATT: " Well... that makes me feel more
comfortable, thank you very much."

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.462
LAURA: Of course.

01:13:17.462 --> 01:13:19.015
MATT: "I appreciate it."

01:13:20.805 --> 01:13:23.059
LAURA: Do you guys want to eat anything?

01:13:23.219 --> 01:13:26.851
(sounds of agreement)

01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:31.048
MATT: "Very well! I will ensure that you are all
properly taken care of this night." (clapping

01:13:31.048 --> 01:13:36.760
twice) She goes ahead and brings the servants back
in. A meal is placed for the rest of you, and as

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.453
the evening progresses, and you take a bit of time
to rest--

01:13:40.453 --> 01:13:42.517
MARISHA: Like a short rest?

01:13:42.517 --> 01:13:46.452
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and take a short rest. You
guys manage to enjoy probably one of the better

01:13:46.452 --> 01:13:48.838
meals you've had in a while.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.666
SAM: Jester, why did you lie to your mom?

01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:54.105
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:13:54.105 --> 01:13:56.471
LAURA: Is my mom still in this room?

01:13:56.471 --> 01:13:58.920
SAM: We're whispering, she can't hear us.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.697
LAURA: Look, here's the thing--

01:14:01.055 --> 01:14:05.396
MATT: You guys are eating downstairs. They're not
bringing room service up into her chambers.

01:14:05.396 --> 01:14:07.359
LIAM: Oh, so we're no longer with Marion?

01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:08.370
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:09.537
LIAM: Okay.

01:14:09.537 --> 01:14:12.138
LAURA: Look, I don't want her getting in trouble
for anything that happened.

01:14:12.138 --> 01:14:13.634
SAM: Why would she get in trouble? We did it.

01:14:13.634 --> 01:14:16.857
LAURA: I don't know! The less she knows, the
better! What if she found out something and she

01:14:16.857 --> 01:14:19.249
judged me for it because we did something bad?

01:14:19.249 --> 01:14:22.161
SAM: What if she finds out you lied to her and
judges you for that?

01:14:22.161 --> 01:14:24.035
LAURA: She won't. Why would she find out?

01:14:24.035 --> 01:14:28.678
LIAM: You know, I had the same thought. Really,
either she believes Jester and no big deal, or she

01:14:28.678 --> 01:14:32.426
doesn't believe Jester and knows that it's taken
care of.

01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:36.634
SAM: You should never lie to your mother.

01:14:36.634 --> 01:14:43.344
LAURA: Well, I usually don't. It's just to protect
her. It is a white lie.

01:14:43.344 --> 01:14:45.299
SAM: All right.

01:14:47.457 --> 01:14:52.954
MATT: You hear the heavy footfalls of Bluude
making his way down the stairs and goes and finds

01:14:52.954 --> 01:14:58.805
a corner just to keep an eye. Then Marion, now
dressed in her casual evening gown, which in

01:14:58.805 --> 01:15:04.248
itself is still regal and beautiful and trails
behind her up the stairs as she descends, comes to

01:15:04.248 --> 01:15:10.604
join you at the table and sits. She smiles at the
rest of you and gives a renewed nod to Yasha, whom

01:15:10.604 --> 01:15:21.046
she just met. "Well, I am very happy to see that
you've made a good group of friends, a travel

01:15:21.046 --> 01:15:26.168
family. Just warms my heart."

01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:30.221
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.834
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:15:32.158 --> 01:15:33.797
MATT: "Is everything all right?"

01:15:33.797 --> 01:15:35.334
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:15:35.334 --> 01:15:38.221
LAURA: Oh no, is it bad? What did I do? Was it
bad?

01:15:38.221 --> 01:15:43.322
SAM: You didn't do anything. No, this is very
good.

01:15:43.322 --> 01:15:47.263
LIAM: Jester feels like that perhaps she is
imposing, bringing all of us here, and we are

01:15:47.263 --> 01:15:49.316
trying to convince her that that is silly.

01:15:49.316 --> 01:15:53.728
MATT: "Not in the slightest! Jester, this is no
imposition. I'm just happy to have you home for a bit."

01:15:53.892 --> 01:15:57.509
LAURA: I'm happy to be home for a bit.

01:15:57.509 --> 01:16:00.103
MATT: "How long do you intend to stay?"

01:16:00.103 --> 01:16:07.354
LAURA: Oh, well, I don't know. We're here for
Fjord, really, so it's up to him.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:11.446
TRAVIS: That's not true, this is your home! It's
where you're from.

01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:14.436
LAURA: Weren't you trying to find out about the
guys?

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:16.789
TRAVIS: Yeah, we have time.

01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:22.084
LAURA: Fjord swallowed a ball, and it's inside of
him now, and he doesn't know what's going on, so--

01:16:22.084 --> 01:16:25.611
TRAVIS: We're going to tell the truth about that?

01:16:27.886 --> 01:16:32.923
MATT: "I have a friend who had a similar problem
years ago. If you would like, there is a physician

01:16:32.923 --> 01:16:38.424
we could have take a look at you and see if we can
a way to no longer have that problem?"

01:16:38.424 --> 01:16:41.188
MARISHA: Oh man, I want to hear that story.

01:16:41.188 --> 01:16:43.073
TRAVIS: I would be glad to--

01:16:43.073 --> 01:16:44.918
LAURA: Mama, it's not that kind of ball he
swallowed.

01:16:44.918 --> 01:16:46.761
SAM: You had a friend that swallowed a stone?

01:16:46.761 --> 01:16:52.663
LIAM: Frau Lavorre, you have such a lovely
daughter. She's so charming and such a spitfire.

01:16:52.663 --> 01:16:59.338
It has been such a pleasure to get to know her.
I've been curious for weeks now, almost months-- I

01:16:59.338 --> 01:17:04.524
think it's been almost months-- what she was like
as a child, because she's such a joy now.

01:17:04.971 --> 01:17:15.124
MATT: "Ah, young Jester was rambunctious, curious,
ever running off, getting into, well, trouble, and

01:17:15.124 --> 01:17:24.425
finding trouble, making trouble. For me, it was a
joy. She was very quick to learn, ever smiling,

01:17:24.425 --> 01:17:32.853
brightening any chamber she walked into. She had a
good sense for who needed to be taken down a peg."

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:37.243
LIAM: So she was always a prankster.

01:17:37.243 --> 01:17:42.300
MATT: "Very much so, more so around adolescence, I
think."

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:45.334
LAURA: Yeah, I guess so.

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:50.815
MATT: "But she has always been sweet,
inspirational--"

01:17:50.815 --> 01:17:53.817
LAURA: Very sweet, see? I am very sweet.

01:17:54.168 --> 01:17:55.802
MATT: "Very proud of her."

01:17:55.802 --> 01:17:58.252
MARISHA: Do you have any good embarrassing
stories?

01:17:58.252 --> 01:18:04.035
MATT: "Yes but not anything I can speak of in
mixed company."

01:18:04.035 --> 01:18:05.929
MARISHA: Are we in mixed company?

01:18:05.929 --> 01:18:09.946
MATT: You guys are in the downstairs, in the main
tavern area of the Chateau.

01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:12.084
MARISHA: Right, right.

01:18:12.084 --> 01:18:18.268
LAURA: I didn't get to come down here very much
and eat with you. It's nice to be able to be here now.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.422
MATT: "I agree."

01:18:20.422 --> 01:18:23.369
LAURA: Shit. I'm not disguised, fuck. I need to
remember to do this more.

01:18:25.359 --> 01:18:26.829
(dice hit the table)

01:18:26.829 --> 01:18:28.452
MARISHA: Oh no!

01:18:28.827 --> 01:18:31.415
SAM: Do you want to borrow my mask?

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.178
LAURA: Oh no. I have that other mask that I
bought.

01:18:34.178 --> 01:18:35.918
SAM: What mask?

01:18:35.918 --> 01:18:40.100
LAURA: Remember the metal mask, that I bought when
I was with you? I'm going to put it on.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.213
SAM: Yeah, that's good dinner wear.

01:18:42.213 --> 01:18:51.537
MATT: It's a big old cast iron tiki mask with
giant tusks, oof. All right.

01:18:51.537 --> 01:18:55.109
TRAVIS: With tiefling horns and tail coming out of
it.

01:18:56.018 --> 01:19:03.376
MATT: "Curious choice, but I understand probably
for the best. There is not much of a mouth hole,

01:19:03.376 --> 01:19:10.868
so eating is going to be very difficult." Takes a
little spoon and is like, "All right, here we go

01:19:10.994 --> 01:19:18.560
try to make it-- there it is. Perfect." You guys
talk for a bit. She shares some embarrassing

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:25.682
stories of Jester's childhood. Asks each of you a
little bit about your story, and we'll say for the

01:19:25.682 --> 01:19:31.598
better part of the evening, it's an enjoyable
respite from the chaos of the day and the chaos of

01:19:31.598 --> 01:19:38.419
the journey. Your blink dog has dried, as has your
weasel.

01:19:38.419 --> 01:19:41.654
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Can I go check on Professor
Thaddeus?

01:19:41.654 --> 01:19:49.393
MATT: You can, and as you go ahead and find--
there is a coat room, essentially, where the young

01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:55.790
man who had originally met you when you got there
is inside. You can see him sitting in the back on

01:19:55.790 --> 01:20:03.100
a stool going like this. He's staring in the far
way, and there's a coat rack where Professor

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:09.205
Thaddeus is sitting on there, staring at him. As
you enter the chamber--

01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:10.184
MARISHA: Hey.

01:20:10.184 --> 01:20:11.454
MATT: "Oh, hey."

01:20:11.577 --> 01:20:12.973
MARISHA: Is my bird okay?

01:20:12.973 --> 01:20:19.336
MATT: You can see there's some scratches on his
cheek. "Yeah, he's fine. Just watching him right there."

01:20:19.872 --> 01:20:23.898
MARISHA: Uh-huh. You didn't traumatize him, did
you?

01:20:23.898 --> 01:20:29.728
MATT: I think not? Hard to feed these.

01:20:29.728 --> 01:20:37.202
MARISHA: Yeah, I know. I grab the food that I just
took from my plate and I'm like, "Thaddeus, come.

01:20:37.202 --> 01:20:39.818
Thaddeus?"

01:20:39.818 --> 01:20:41.965
MATT: Roll an animal handling check.

01:20:41.965 --> 01:20:44.291
MARISHA: Fuck me. Fucking animals. Why did I do
this?

01:20:44.561 --> 01:20:48.819
Oh no. Six. Fuck that die.

01:20:48.819 --> 01:20:51.292
TRAVIS: "I'm going to have an owl!"

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:59.456
MATT: He dives towards you and goes right over
your shoulder and is now in the middle of the

01:20:59.456 --> 01:21:08.991
central tavern. (fluttering) The leather cord of
his leash is now dangling as he's up in the

01:21:08.991 --> 01:21:12.170
rafters (hooting).

01:21:12.361 --> 01:21:15.514
MARISHA: I can't control him, you guys. He has a
mind of his own. He's a free person.

01:21:15.514 --> 01:21:18.600
MATT: Everyone in the chamber's like-- there're
people that are eating who are like, "What the--?"

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.914
They're all staring up at this owl that has now
found a brief perch up into the roof chamber.

01:21:23.058 --> 01:21:27.217
MARISHA: Oh, you've all seen an owl before, shut
up!

01:21:27.217 --> 01:21:30.418
TRAVIS: I think they're worried about the--
(whistles)

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:32.218
MARISHA: It'll be fine.

01:21:32.218 --> 01:21:38.545
LIAM: Caleb summons Frumpkin the octopus and I rub
his head like a Bond villain, staring at Beau.

01:21:38.545 --> 01:21:41.261
MATT: Squeaks like a balloon.

01:21:41.261 --> 01:21:50.647
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull one of the beetles out
of my staff and say, "Professor, you want a

01:21:50.647 --> 01:21:55.311
snack?" I hold it up.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:56.875
MATT: You're holding the beetle?

01:21:56.875 --> 01:21:58.420
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:21:58.420 --> 01:21:59.980
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.005
SAM: Oh boy, there goes your finger.

01:22:05.606 --> 01:22:06.857
TALIESIN: 12.

01:22:06.857 --> 01:22:13.726
MATT: Eventually, it dives down, snatches and-- a
little prick on the finger from one of the

01:22:13.726 --> 01:22:19.528
talons-- but, eventually, makes a quick meal and
heads back up.

01:22:21.154 --> 01:22:22.524
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:22:23.201 --> 01:22:26.437
SAM: What happens if we have to leave and the bird
is still here?

01:22:26.437 --> 01:22:35.731
LAURA: You can climb up. Yeah, you're a monk, you
can climb up to the ceiling. Hey, Mama?

01:22:35.731 --> 01:22:37.362
MATT: "Yes?"

01:22:37.362 --> 01:22:42.342
LAURA: Will you watch my puppy? Well, it's me and
Beau's puppy, really.

01:22:42.342 --> 01:22:43.711
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:22:43.711 --> 01:22:47.814
LAURA: Will you watch our puppy while we go out
tonight?

01:22:47.814 --> 01:22:54.444
MATT: "Of course. To be honest, I've been thinking
about maybe having a pet, so this will be good training."

01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:56.311
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:22:56.311 --> 01:22:59.651
MATT: "Well, since you've been gone, you know."

01:22:59.651 --> 01:23:01.800
MARISHA: How do you feel about owls?

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.917
SAM: And a weasel?

01:23:03.917 --> 01:23:09.224
MATT: "They're interesting, definitely."

01:23:09.224 --> 01:23:16.977
LAURA: Are you good with puppies? Because this
one's kind of special.

01:23:16.977 --> 01:23:24.704
MATT: "I imagine that it is-- how is it special?
This sounds like a warning."

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:29.183
TRAVIS: (laughing) This sounds like a warning.

01:23:29.183 --> 01:23:31.235
LAURA: Nugget. Poof!

01:23:31.235 --> 01:23:33.251
SAM: Lift off your mask.

01:23:33.251 --> 01:23:35.847
LAURA: Oh, thank you. Nugget, it's me. Poof!

01:23:35.847 --> 01:23:41.712
MATT: (poof) It appears on your chest and catch it
for a second. She's like, "Oh my."

01:23:41.712 --> 01:23:43.602
LAURA: He blinks.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:49.433
MATT: "That is as tricky as, perhaps, the daughter
that I have."

01:23:49.433 --> 01:23:57.461
LAURA: Aww. I'm going to tell Nugget to look at my
Mama and say, blink to her right now, okay, for as

01:23:57.461 --> 01:24:01.055
long as we tell you to. That's home.

01:24:01.055 --> 01:24:04.166
MATT: (panting)

01:24:04.166 --> 01:24:07.555
LAURA: Mama, tell him you're home.

01:24:07.555 --> 01:24:09.925
MATT: "You're home."

01:24:09.925 --> 01:24:13.430
LAURA: No, tell him you are home. You are his
home.

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:16.825
MATT: "Oh. I am your home."

01:24:16.825 --> 01:24:24.236
LAURA: That's good, here. Be careful, he pees on
things.

01:24:24.236 --> 01:24:29.295
MATT: Immediately, she goes, "Heh," and pets him
over the table.

01:24:31.515 --> 01:24:33.855
SAM: You got rid of a dog, that's great!

01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:35.936
LAURA: I didn't get rid of him.

01:24:35.936 --> 01:24:38.619
SAM: Yeah, but we don't have to have him anymore,
so that's good, right?

01:24:38.758 --> 01:24:40.684
LAURA: He's still our dog.

01:24:40.684 --> 01:24:42.122
SAM: All right.

01:24:42.122 --> 01:24:46.191
LIAM: Perhaps Nugget could live here and you could
visit him when you come home.

01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:49.912
LAURA: Maybe.

01:24:50.036 --> 01:24:51.955
SAM: The weasel and the owl?

01:24:51.955 --> 01:24:57.667
LAURA: No, the weasel's staying with me. I know,
it's such a temptation.

01:24:57.667 --> 01:25:01.148
SAM: I know, I want to eat that weasel so bad!

01:25:01.148 --> 01:25:03.516
MARISHA: Are we going to go down to the docks?

01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:04.949
SAM: Yeah. Is it almost midnight?

01:25:04.949 --> 01:25:06.548
MATT: Yeah, it's getting close. About 11, 11:20.

01:25:06.775 --> 01:25:07.816
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:25:07.816 --> 01:25:09.068
SAM: Let's go.

01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:10.104
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.259
MATT: All right.

01:25:11.259 --> 01:25:14.188
MARISHA: I try-- Professor Thaddeus! You want to
come?

01:25:14.188 --> 01:25:16.090
MATT: Make one more animal handling check.

01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:18.859
MARISHA: Fuck me. Just come to me, you dick.

01:25:19.022 --> 01:25:21.354
Ooh, that's a natural 19. 22.

01:25:21.354 --> 01:25:22.689
SAM: Whoa!

01:25:22.689 --> 01:25:24.548
LAURA: See? He responds when you talk sternly.

01:25:24.548 --> 01:25:26.607
MARISHA: Yeah! Fucking--

01:25:26.607 --> 01:25:32.872
MATT: Eventually, seeing this command-- (flapping)
comes to rest onto your wrist.

01:25:32.872 --> 01:25:37.830
MARISHA: (excited breathing) I mean, that's
fucking right.

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:39.495
LIAM: Third time's the charm.

01:25:39.495 --> 01:25:40.859
MARISHA: Let's go.

01:25:40.859 --> 01:25:42.940
SAM: He likes cursing, I guess.

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:45.366
TRAVIS: Is he coming with?

01:25:45.366 --> 01:25:47.455
MARISHA: He's coming with us to the docks, I
guess.

01:25:47.455 --> 01:25:51.755
TRAVIS: Okay, yep. Good. We're inconspicuous with
a big fucking horned owl on your arm.

01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:53.601
MARISHA: Oh, we're trying to be inconspicuous?

01:25:53.601 --> 01:25:56.051
SAM: No, it's fine. It'll be great. He'll be fine,
he can see in the dark.

01:25:56.051 --> 01:25:57.778
MARISHA: Right? Exactly.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.816
TALIESIN: We can get you a tree costume, you'll
fit right in.

01:26:00.816 --> 01:26:03.636
LIAM: We're fucking Hermione Granger up in this
shit.

01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:04.966
TRAVIS: She had a cat.

01:26:04.966 --> 01:26:07.512
LAURA: I put my hood up. I take the mask off, but
I put my hood up.

01:26:07.687 --> 01:26:12.371
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way through the
streets heading towards where?

01:26:12.371 --> 01:26:14.298
TRAVIS: The--

01:26:15.279 --> 01:26:17.587
SAM: You know. The docks.

01:26:17.587 --> 01:26:19.760
MATT: Yeah, well, there's the Restless Wharf and
there's the Open Quay.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.586
SAM: We were told maybe one of those?

01:26:23.586 --> 01:26:25.723
MATT: The place that you had heard this
information--

01:26:25.723 --> 01:26:27.975
LIAM: Did Orly say specific docks?

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:32.222
TRAVIS: It was the Open Quay right? Was where he
wanders at midnight?

01:26:32.222 --> 01:26:37.748
MARISHA: We were at the Wayfarer's Cove. Which is
in the Restless Wharf.

01:26:37.748 --> 01:26:41.821
MATT: You didn't get any specifics, he just said
near the docks, but you were in the Restless Wharf

01:26:41.821 --> 01:26:43.360
when you got this information.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.746
LIAM: Yes. Yes.

01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:47.981
MATT: All right. Who's helming a lookout?

01:26:48.491 --> 01:26:49.913
TALIESIN: I'll do that.

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:51.576
SAM: I put up my hood as well.

01:26:51.576 --> 01:26:54.250
LIAM: We've got lamplight on the streets to
varying degree.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:27:01.720
MATT: Yeah. There are torch poles set up towards
the wharf that are giving a faint bit of light,

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:06.146
but other than that, it's not a full moon, but
it's mostly full and there's quite a bit of

01:27:06.146 --> 01:27:10.265
moonlight coming down over the dock. You can see
it glittering across the water in the center of

01:27:10.265 --> 01:27:16.452
the harbor. There are a number of ships quietly
set out in that vicinity. The star-clustered sky

01:27:16.452 --> 01:27:25.064
completely envelopes the air above you. It's a
beautiful view. The closer you get to the docks,

01:27:25.064 --> 01:27:30.906
you can hear the sound of waves crashing from out
of view, the creaking of wet wood filling the air

01:27:30.906 --> 01:27:35.245
as the docks shift and the number of boats that
are currently moored to the center of the harbor

01:27:35.245 --> 01:27:42.312
creak from side to side as the water comes in.
Every now and then, you see the slow glowing beam

01:27:42.312 --> 01:27:50.213
of the Lighthouse pass overhead about once a
minute or so. It's a very slow moving, pulsing

01:27:50.213 --> 01:27:59.054
rhythm. Now ships of varying sizes sit across the
dock spread, tied to their various posts, all

01:27:59.054 --> 01:28:03.676
seemingly lightless and lifeless in their slumber.
There's no one doing any sort of evening work on

01:28:03.676 --> 01:28:09.637
these ships at this hour. You see a handful of
zhelezo patrolling up and down the sides of the

01:28:09.637 --> 01:28:18.364
dock doing their rounds, no urgency or direction
necessarily. Make a perception check, if you don't

01:28:18.364 --> 01:28:20.181
mind, Clay.

01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:26.677
TALIESIN: That's a 26.

01:28:27.187 --> 01:28:31.659
MATT: 26, jesus! Okay then. You--

01:28:31.659 --> 01:28:33.272
LIAM: Wise as fuck.

01:28:35.071 --> 01:28:41.200
MATT: You watch out for one of the westernmost
docks of the district to see a shady figure

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:47.421
darting between patrols. Watching as the zhelezo
will pass and then use that moment to dart across

01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:51.297
the street and wait for the next zhelezo to pass
and then make their way over to the edge of the

01:28:51.297 --> 01:28:59.070
wharf. You see them now ducking near a stack of
empty shipping crates and they wait, every now and

01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:05.341
then glancing over when a zhelezo's not nearby or
looking towards one of the darkened ships that is

01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:09.965
anchored towards one of the dock extensions, not
that far from one of the docking cranes that's

01:29:09.965 --> 01:29:16.236
left still after an evening of offloading from one
of the other ships.

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.119
TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:24.610
LAURA: What do you see?

01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:31.302
TALIESIN: I mean, it's pretty quiet. Other than
that guy hiding over there by the shipping crates,

01:29:31.302 --> 01:29:33.623
there's really nothing to see.

01:29:33.623 --> 01:29:35.991
LAURA: Is he blond? Is he a blond half-elf?

01:29:35.991 --> 01:29:40.890
TALIESIN: It's really dark. I don't know. Other
than that, there's nothing really happening.

01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:42.331
LAURA: There's a guy darting.

01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:43.682
SAM: Should I go dart after him?

01:29:43.682 --> 01:29:44.598
LAURA: Ooh.

01:29:44.598 --> 01:29:45.522
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:29:45.522 --> 01:29:46.842
TALIESIN: Are we playing darts?

01:29:46.842 --> 01:29:48.605
LAURA: Wait, do you want-- Blessing of the
Trickster!

01:29:48.605 --> 01:29:50.421
SAM: Ah! What does that do?

01:29:50.421 --> 01:29:52.050
LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth checks!

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:53.644
SAM: Okay, great.

01:29:53.644 --> 01:29:55.451
LIAM: Episode 30 something.

01:29:55.451 --> 01:29:59.700
MATT: You do watch as a zhelezo holding one of
their portable torches and a sheathed sword

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:05.682
glances over in the direction of where that shaded
figure is. Steps towards it and holds the torch up

01:30:05.731 --> 01:30:13.672
and begins a soft call out. "Hello?" The shaded
figure stands up and approaches, hands open,

01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:25.099
smiling. Getting a better look, you do see finer
elven features, a lighter, ashy hair that's short

01:30:25.099 --> 01:30:32.124
on the sides and flopped in the front who
approaches, talks briefly. You can't really hear

01:30:32.124 --> 01:30:37.358
what they're saying, it's hushed, but puts
something into the hands of the zhelezo. The

01:30:37.358 --> 01:30:41.787
zhelezo takes a moment, nods and then turns around
and leaves his post.

01:30:41.868 --> 01:30:43.850
TALIESIN: That's really useful information.

01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:45.084
LAURA: Ooh.

01:30:45.084 --> 01:30:46.461
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:30:46.461 --> 01:30:49.562
MATT: The figure goes and then darts back behind
the crates once more and keeps looking over

01:30:49.562 --> 01:30:55.680
towards that one single ship that's about 35 or 40
feet from where he's sitting.

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.930
LAURA: I wonder what he's waiting for.

01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:00.652
MARISHA: Yeah. Looks like someone that's waiting
for a handoff if I've seen them.

01:31:00.652 --> 01:31:02.883
TALIESIN: I wonder how much he paid to bribe the
guard.

01:31:02.883 --> 01:31:06.392
MARISHA: Apparently five gold is a great going
rate.

01:31:06.392 --> 01:31:07.920
LAURA: That's true. That's what we did.

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.035
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:31:09.035 --> 01:31:10.702
TALIESIN: Huh.

01:31:11.047 --> 01:31:18.684
SAM: Seeing as there's no guard, I'm going to dart
over towards where he's hiding, but not right on

01:31:18.684 --> 01:31:21.059
him or anything, across the way.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:22.942
MATT: Make a stealth check with advantage.

01:31:22.942 --> 01:31:25.561
SAM: Ooh, that's a one. That's slightly better.

01:31:25.707 --> 01:31:27.173
MARISHA: Ooh, that's right!

01:31:27.173 --> 01:31:29.929
SAM: Stealth? 17.

01:31:29.929 --> 01:31:43.866
MATT: Okay. You make your way over to the side of
the docks on the opposite end and there's a little

01:31:43.866 --> 01:31:47.732
step up from this edge of the street and you have
a few buildings begin to give way. The road ends

01:31:47.732 --> 01:31:53.609
and there are bits of it that break off and fall
off the short cliffs into the water. There's the

01:31:53.609 --> 01:31:58.755
docking crane to your left on a bigger piece of
the dock that's out of the way, but it's blocking

01:31:58.755 --> 01:32:06.228
a lot of the view on this side. The ship that this
figure is focused on and the crates that he's by

01:32:06.228 --> 01:32:10.128
on one side. You get to the other and keeping
quiet. You don't think you've been noticed.

01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:12.250
SAM: Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:14.077
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:32:14.518 --> 01:32:16.540
SAM: Perception check. Nine.

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:17.930
MARISHA: Ooh. Nine.

01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:19.432
SAM: Yes.

01:32:19.432 --> 01:32:22.378
MATT: You're waiting. Not much else seems to be
going on.

01:32:22.378 --> 01:32:28.549
SAM: (nervous chuckle) Great. Well, I'm ready. For
anything.

01:32:28.549 --> 01:32:30.185
MATT: Okay. You just sit there and wait?

01:32:30.185 --> 01:32:31.225
SAM: Yeah.

01:32:31.225 --> 01:32:32.782
MATT: Okay. The rest of you doing anything?

01:32:32.782 --> 01:32:37.107
LIAM: Yeah. While all that was happening I'm
halfway through, as a ritual spell, casting Find

01:32:37.107 --> 01:32:40.550
Familiar so I can change Frumpkin to something
else.

01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:42.548
MATT: Okay.

01:32:42.548 --> 01:32:44.287
LIAM: I'll tell you in a minute.

01:32:44.287 --> 01:32:51.722
MATT: Mmkay. You begin casting that. Caduceus, as
this is happening, there are a few of those torch

01:32:51.722 --> 01:33:00.179
poles set up and there's one at each dock nexus.
The one by that ship the light flickers out.

01:33:00.179 --> 01:33:01.917
MARISHA: Motherfuckers.

01:33:01.917 --> 01:33:04.465
TALIESIN: Well, that's a thing. You guys see that?

01:33:04.465 --> 01:33:05.396
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:33:05.396 --> 01:33:07.279
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:07.279 --> 01:33:10.901
MATT: You don't see that, and you're not close
enough to hear any of this. You see as a handful

01:33:10.901 --> 01:33:15.666
of figures seemed to have come out of that ship,
walked across the gangplank and put that

01:33:15.666 --> 01:33:17.365
torchlight out.

01:33:17.365 --> 01:33:20.854
TALIESIN: I think something's happening.

01:33:20.854 --> 01:33:22.978
LAURA: What do the figures look like?

01:33:22.978 --> 01:33:26.244
MATT: Make a perception check for you if you want
to glance, or are you asking Caduceus?

01:33:26.244 --> 01:33:27.766
LAURA: I want to look.

01:33:27.766 --> 01:33:29.744
TRAVIS: Pass that 26.

01:33:29.744 --> 01:33:32.263
LAURA: Yeah, right. I can't tell.

01:33:32.263 --> 01:33:34.263
(phone beeping)

01:33:34.263 --> 01:33:36.228
LIAM: Sorry, Laura.

01:33:36.228 --> 01:33:38.900
LAURA: I got a 14. I can't really tell.

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:42.089
MATT: She can't make out details and even from
this distance, you can't make out a bunch because

01:33:42.089 --> 01:33:49.114
they're all wearing either full cloaks or half
cloaks that end right about just past the elbow.

01:33:49.114 --> 01:33:59.191
Hoods up. Not uniform. Patchwork in color and
make, but they're all obscuring their features intentionally.

01:33:59.303 --> 01:34:01.509
TALIESIN: They look like pirates.

01:34:01.509 --> 01:34:03.704
TRAVIS: Should we go out and tell them we're
bearing gifts and shit?

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:12.018
MARISHA: I was just thinking that. I think maybe a
little bit of familiarity with some underground

01:34:12.018 --> 01:34:15.466
might help the situation.

01:34:15.466 --> 01:34:18.848
TRAVIS: Yeah. Tell them we're bearing gifts and we
want to see the captain, see what happens?

01:34:18.848 --> 01:34:20.015
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:34:20.015 --> 01:34:23.202
MARISHA: Okay. I'll go with you on that.

01:34:23.202 --> 01:34:24.654
TRAVIS: All right.

01:34:24.654 --> 01:34:32.880
MATT: Nott, you watch as the figure that's waiting
stands up, out of the spot, looks around, looks

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.402
that there's no zhelezo currently patrolling at
the moment and begins now to step onto the dock

01:34:37.402 --> 01:34:39.225
and walk towards the figures on the ship.

01:34:39.345 --> 01:34:41.674
SAM: Oh. I will trail behind.

01:34:41.674 --> 01:34:47.974
MATT: Okay. Goes and approaches. The figures,
there's now two that have stepped up to meet and

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:53.890
you can see now there are a few more that are
still in the ship that are watching from--

01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:56.779
MARISHA: How big is this ship? Is it like a ship
or like--?

01:34:56.779 --> 01:35:06.336
MATT: It's a fair size. I'd say from tip to end,
it's about 50 or so feet. Single sail, but a big sail.

01:35:06.491 --> 01:35:09.270
MARISHA: Any iconography on the sail?

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:18.082
MATT: It's currently furled up. It looks like it's
a ship that's designed for speed more than cargo,

01:35:18.082 --> 01:35:21.208
but it's a decent-sized ship.

01:35:21.208 --> 01:35:27.849
SAM: The layout of the dock, is the front of the
ship near the dock? Is it pulled up? Is it

01:35:27.849 --> 01:35:29.417
parallel parked?

01:35:29.417 --> 01:35:33.840
MATT: The dock, as you're walking, continues
forward and then it turns a little bit at an

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:39.121
angle, and there are other ships that are docked.
There's a smaller fishing ship on one side,

01:35:39.121 --> 01:35:45.110
there's a rowboat that's set off in the water
there. It's facing towards you at an angle and is

01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:50.475
currently anchored at the edge of where the dock
turns to the right. There is a gangplank set out

01:35:50.475 --> 01:35:54.544
between that and the dock where the figures are
stepping up. They're meeting right where that

01:35:54.544 --> 01:35:57.210
gangplank is and where that torch was snuffed.

01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:02.224
MARISHA: Hey, Fjord? You've got that fancy armor
that helps you float. Do you think maybe you could

01:36:02.224 --> 01:36:06.462
get underneath the docks? Overhear something?

01:36:06.462 --> 01:36:13.317
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like that. I'll run and-- staying
a good distance in-- I'll drop off the docks under

01:36:13.317 --> 01:36:15.737
the water and start swimming.

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:16.737
SAM: SEAL team.

01:36:16.737 --> 01:36:19.256
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a--

01:36:24.566 --> 01:36:26.895
How do I want to do this?

01:36:27.819 --> 01:36:29.895
SAM: That's your autobiography title!

01:36:29.895 --> 01:36:37.854
MATT: There you go. I walked into that one. Make
an acrobatics check for me, Fjord.

01:36:39.083 --> 01:36:41.445
MARISHA: No splash, no splash! Ten points!

01:36:41.445 --> 01:36:43.374
TRAVIS: Five.

01:36:43.374 --> 01:36:49.238
MATT: (splashing) The figures all of a sudden all
stop and turn, as well as the one who was talking,

01:36:49.238 --> 01:36:51.309
and they all look in your direction.

01:36:51.309 --> 01:36:53.916
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to make a dolphin sound.

01:36:53.916 --> 01:36:55.883
MARISHA: Yes, yes! Yes, queen, yes!

01:36:55.883 --> 01:36:57.340
SAM: Night dolphins!

01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:59.838
LAURA: (dolphin chittering)

01:37:00.028 --> 01:37:04.712
MATT: Thaumaturgy-- it's not so much an audio
mimicry spell, but you can make certain sounds

01:37:04.712 --> 01:37:09.145
happen, so I'll say roll a performance check.

01:37:09.145 --> 01:37:16.853
LAURA: Aww, seven.

01:37:16.853 --> 01:37:20.300
MATT: (unconvincing dolphin chittering)

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:24.010
(laughter)

01:37:24.010 --> 01:37:30.754
MATT: It seems to not assuage their fears and more
make them more worried and curious as to what's

01:37:30.754 --> 01:37:38.193
happening. You watch as the two figures there
start looking over towards the initial figure that

01:37:38.193 --> 01:37:45.424
you were following and are looking really
aggressive towards them. The figure's hands are up

01:37:45.424 --> 01:37:50.799
and are like-- (stammering). There's this heated
conversation going. The figures in the ship are

01:37:50.799 --> 01:37:57.613
getting things at the ready that you can't see,
but it looks like they are very much on guard. The

01:37:57.613 --> 01:38:03.769
two that were talking, one of them grabs the
scruff of the figure and holds him there, while

01:38:03.769 --> 01:38:08.443
the other one, blade drawn, begins to approach the
edge of the dock where that noise came from.

01:38:08.443 --> 01:38:17.202
MARISHA: I turn to Caleb and I go: There! I threw
our engagement ring and our life and I fed it to

01:38:17.202 --> 01:38:23.110
the rabies dolphins! It's over, okay?! It's over!

01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:24.750
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:28.464
LAURA: I like that your ring made a (loud
splashing).

01:38:28.464 --> 01:38:30.823
MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage.

01:38:30.823 --> 01:38:33.949
LIAM: Because Caleb is on the ground going--

01:38:33.949 --> 01:38:39.560
MARISHA: Deception with disadvantage. Okay, 11.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:49.218
MATT: As you give this display, the figure with
the sword out that was looking for the edge of the

01:38:49.218 --> 01:38:57.104
water where Fjord was looks over at you and goes--
with the little bit of features you can see a

01:38:57.104 --> 01:39:05.269
chin, a scruffy beard poking out beneath the hood,
still with the blade there, turns back, gives a

01:39:05.269 --> 01:39:07.519
hand motion towards the ship.

01:39:07.519 --> 01:39:14.113
TRAVIS: I didn't even ask: how far is the water
from the fucking dock? Five feet, or like 15 feet?

01:39:14.113 --> 01:39:18.347
Is it a tall dock?

01:39:18.347 --> 01:39:21.458
MATT: Oh, it's about ten foot.

01:39:21.458 --> 01:39:26.216
TRAVIS: Okay. Sweet, I can't even get out of this
water if I wanted to.

01:39:26.311 --> 01:39:28.199
MATT: You can climb up on the cliff if you need
to.

01:39:28.199 --> 01:39:30.138
LIAM: Also, has ten minutes gone by?

01:39:30.138 --> 01:39:35.627
MATT: No. When you started this, everyone was
going into the-- you're maybe three minutes.

01:39:35.627 --> 01:39:42.144
LIAM: You didn't correct me, but I said while Nott
was foofing around, so some time passed. Five, ten

01:39:42.144 --> 01:39:45.062
didn't, but you're the DM.

01:39:45.062 --> 01:39:49.921
SAM: While this is all going on, I'm going to cast
Message and send it to Caleb and say: There's

01:39:49.921 --> 01:39:57.008
something in the water! There's some argument
happening. Something's going horribly wrong,

01:39:57.008 --> 01:40:00.289
Caleb. We should get out of here! You can respond
to this message.

01:40:00.289 --> 01:40:04.835
MARISHA: My mom was right! I never should have
gotten involved with you.

01:40:04.835 --> 01:40:08.765
LIAM: I know that I am so close to the end of the
spell and I am going to push through.

01:40:08.765 --> 01:40:12.930
MARISHA: (Tracy voice) Look, this is why! Every time
I try to talk to you, you play with your toys.

01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:22.175
MATT: The figure gets within 15 feet of where
you're standing and says, "Hey! Piss off!"

01:40:22.175 --> 01:40:31.983
MARISHA: Hey, you know what? You piss off, okay?
I've had a rough day. I just wanted to be by

01:40:31.983 --> 01:40:33.668
myself near the ocean!

01:40:33.668 --> 01:40:43.359
MATT: Closes his fist. Three arrows get loosed
from the ship in your direction. That's a 14 to

01:40:43.359 --> 01:40:47.600
hit. Misses, I believe? That's a 19 to hit.

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.468
MARISHA: Hits.

01:40:49.468 --> 01:40:51.351
MATT: And another 19.

01:40:51.351 --> 01:40:53.302
MARISHA: Hits.

01:40:53.302 --> 01:40:54.240
LAURA: Run away, Tracy.

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.178
MARISHA: (whispering) Never.

01:40:55.178 --> 01:40:58.751
MATT: That is seven points of damage.

01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:01.934
MARISHA: I'm going to Deflect Missiles.

01:41:01.934 --> 01:41:03.427
MATT: Go for it.

01:41:03.427 --> 01:41:06.863
MARISHA: What do I have to roll for that? Hang on,
sorry.

01:41:06.863 --> 01:41:09.757
MATT: It's 1d10 plus your monk level, isn't it?

01:41:09.757 --> 01:41:15.442
MARISHA: It's reaction, damage minus 1d10 plus my
monk level. It just happens, right?

01:41:15.442 --> 01:41:18.944
MATT: Yeah, you roll a d10 plus your monk level.

01:41:18.944 --> 01:41:21.563
MARISHA: Right, but my monk level is--

01:41:21.563 --> 01:41:22.580
MATT: Six.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:31.923
MARISHA: Yeah, so I'm good. I'm going to spend a
ki point to send it back at this guy. Yeah, this

01:41:31.923 --> 01:41:33.394
is happening.

01:41:33.394 --> 01:41:40.224
SAM: I love that she was having a fight with her
boyfriend with a giant owl on her shoulder.

01:41:40.224 --> 01:41:48.235
MARISHA: He's my rock. He's the only one who
understands me. Okay, I'm attacking. Natural 20.

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:55.441
MATT: Ooh, okay. Roll a d6 plus--

01:41:55.441 --> 01:42:00.320
MARISHA: I thought I got a d10. It's whatever the
bolt is, back at him.

01:42:00.873 --> 01:42:08.111
MATT: Right, the arrow is a d6 plus your dexterity
modifier.

01:42:08.111 --> 01:42:10.221
MARISHA: Plus my dex?

01:42:10.221 --> 01:42:18.173
MATT: I believe it's-- let me check the rules real
fast.

01:42:18.173 --> 01:42:20.413
MARISHA: Weapon damage, plus my dex.

01:42:20.413 --> 01:42:22.527
MATT: Yeah, it's a d6 plus your dex.

01:42:22.527 --> 01:42:23.765
MARISHA: Seven.

01:42:23.765 --> 01:42:30.672
MATT: Seven points of damage. You send one back,
you hear (pained grunt), but at a pretty decent

01:42:30.672 --> 01:42:36.291
distance. The other one that hit you, that's eight
points of damage.

01:42:36.291 --> 01:42:38.407
MARISHA: Deflect Missiles.

01:42:38.407 --> 01:42:44.214
MATT: That's a second ki point you spent.

01:42:44.214 --> 01:42:47.057
MARISHA: No, it's only a ki point when I send it
back.

01:42:47.057 --> 01:42:50.227
MATT: Right, but you've already used one reaction,
so you have to spend another ki point to get an

01:42:50.227 --> 01:42:51.305
additional reaction.

01:42:51.305 --> 01:42:53.833
MARISHA: Got you. I will do that.

01:42:53.833 --> 01:42:56.110
LAURA: Do you get ki points on short rests?

01:42:56.110 --> 01:43:01.471
MARISHA: Yes, I do. It was seven damage, you
said?

01:43:01.471 --> 01:43:02.716
MATT: Eight points.

01:43:02.716 --> 01:43:04.056
MARISHA: I take one point of damage.

01:43:04.056 --> 01:43:08.530
MATT: One point of piercing damage.

01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:15.747
MARISHA: I'm going to spend another ki point to
send this one back, too.

01:43:15.747 --> 01:43:17.272
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:43:17.272 --> 01:43:20.090
MARISHA: 17.

01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:22.604
MATT: Yeah.

01:43:22.604 --> 01:43:27.299
MARISHA: Ah! Eight damage.

01:43:27.299 --> 01:43:30.919
MATT: Is this to the guy that already took an
arrow, or to another? Because there were three of

01:43:30.919 --> 01:43:32.657
them that fired at you.

01:43:32.657 --> 01:43:35.015
MARISHA: Two at the guy who's closest to me.

01:43:35.015 --> 01:43:41.817
MATT: The same guy gets hit by both arrows. At
this point, the guy who had given the order sees

01:43:41.817 --> 01:43:48.660
you do this and his hand comes down, gives a quick
shout over his shoulder, "Come on! Take them out,

01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.324
"they've seen too much!"

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:53.363
MARISHA: Hey, Caleb?

01:43:53.363 --> 01:43:54.806
LIAM: Ja?

01:43:54.806 --> 01:43:58.508
MARISHA: They don't think I'm a dumb, drunk bitch.
It didn't work.

01:43:58.508 --> 01:44:04.705
LIAM: Matt, before you run off for the thing, can
you describe as Caleb shakes his head out of what

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:09.075
he was doing, what do I see? I haven't paid
attention to any of that.

01:44:09.075 --> 01:44:10.433
MATT: That's what I'm about to show you.

01:44:10.433 --> 01:44:12.880
LIAM: It's going to all be in front of me? I love
this game.

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:16.729
TALIESIN: It's as if he knew that this would go
horribly wrong.

01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:20.141
MARISHA: That this was going to be bad. Sorry,
guys. Sorry.

01:44:20.141 --> 01:44:21.578
TRAVIS: I'm disappointed in us.

01:44:21.578 --> 01:44:22.417
SAM: For what?

01:44:22.417 --> 01:44:25.783
TRAVIS: That was the most flounder-fucky sneak up
ever.

01:44:25.783 --> 01:44:28.576
LIAM: Belly-flop, shitty dolphin, Masterpiece
Theatre.

01:44:28.576 --> 01:44:31.067
MARISHA: We had bad rolls on important things!

01:44:31.067 --> 01:44:36.135
LIAM: Whoa! Holy fuck, this is the best map you've
ever made!

01:44:36.135 --> 01:44:38.234
TALIESIN: All worth it now!

01:44:38.234 --> 01:44:40.452
LAURA: Oh my god, it's so cool.

01:44:40.452 --> 01:44:46.561
ALL: Ooh!

01:44:46.561 --> 01:44:48.201
MATT: That is the figure.

01:44:48.201 --> 01:44:52.711
SAM: I feel like it's a misty night. It feels like
a misty night, don't you think?

01:44:52.711 --> 01:45:00.831
MATT: No, I think we're all right. So you guys
were-- Actually you should be a little further back.

01:45:00.831 --> 01:45:04.050
MARISHA: It feels like we should have figured this
out.

01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:06.824
LIAM: I assume Find Familiar has fizzled?

01:45:06.824 --> 01:45:10.255
TRAVIS: We should have walked up and said, "We've
come bearing gifts. Where is the captain?"

01:45:10.849 --> 01:45:12.143
SAM: That was the first idea.

01:45:12.143 --> 01:45:15.414
MARISHA: It was. Things started moving quickly.

01:45:15.414 --> 01:45:18.792
SAM: Oh, man, this is so cool.

01:45:18.792 --> 01:45:20.577
TALIESIN: This is so badass!

01:45:23.797 --> 01:45:26.337
LAURA: I hope they don't kill Marius.

01:45:26.337 --> 01:45:32.299
MARISHA: We could grab Marius and try and get the
fuck out.

01:45:32.299 --> 01:45:34.925
LIAM: It's a good thing we rested up and waited
until the following night, though.

01:45:34.925 --> 01:45:37.254
LAURA: Yeah, right? So good!

01:45:37.254 --> 01:45:50.674
MATT: Fjord, you are in the water right there.
Caduceus, Jester. Nott, you would have been hiding

01:45:50.674 --> 01:45:52.539
off to the other side of the dock here.

01:45:52.539 --> 01:45:54.743
SAM: Ooh, look at me, well-positioned.

01:45:54.743 --> 01:45:56.814
MATT: Caduceus, Jester?

01:45:56.814 --> 01:45:59.896
TALIESIN: Were we down over there, or--?

01:45:59.896 --> 01:46:07.485
LAURA: Yeah, hiding next to a building or
something. Crouching down, observing, right?

01:46:07.485 --> 01:46:14.062
MATT: You're keeping out of sight, best you can,
to watch this. Yasha-- whoever wants to run

01:46:14.312 --> 01:46:16.691
Yasha-- is going to be with you guys as well.

01:46:16.691 --> 01:46:18.925
TALIESIN: Do we have an iPad for that?

01:46:18.925 --> 01:46:22.572
MATT: We will, because we're going to take a break
before we jump into this, because it's nine

01:46:22.572 --> 01:46:32.963
o'clock. That'll give you guys a moment to figure
your shit out. We'll be right back, here. For this

01:46:32.963 --> 01:46:43.623
giveaway, while we're gone, by Wyrmwood, we have
here the-- oh, it's cherry wood! There's this nice

01:46:43.623 --> 01:46:49.292
little cherry wood piece here with the eastern sea
of the Euphoros Peninsula, drawn by our awesome

01:46:49.292 --> 01:46:57.234
friend Deven Rue. This is the full dice tower and
little dice box set. This will be going to one of

01:46:57.234 --> 01:47:05.107
you lucky winners out there. To enter this
tonight-- where did I put the sheet of paper?

01:47:05.107 --> 01:47:17.284
There it is. Somewhere in the vicinity. (laughs) I
was prepared and then it went away. Well, if I recall--

01:47:19.879 --> 01:47:21.108
TRAVIS: Code word?

01:47:21.108 --> 01:47:31.121
MATT: Yeah, my paper completely vanished. The code
word is marid. M-A-R-I-D, marid. M-A-R-I-D. Head

01:47:31.121 --> 01:47:36.305
over to the Critical Role Twitch chat to enter.
Enter it only once. Any more than that and you'll

01:47:36.305 --> 01:47:40.658
be disqualified. We'll come back with a winner
here in a moment. See you guys in a second.

01:47:41.224 --> 01:47:47.914
MATT: Welcome back. Before we jump back in, we
have the winner. The winner is spraying_mantis.

01:47:47.914 --> 01:47:55.601
Spraying_mantis, congratulations, we'll get your
information and get your Wyrmwood victorious gift

01:47:55.601 --> 01:47:57.043
out to you ASAP.

01:47:57.043 --> 01:47:57.865
LIAM: Spraying_mantis would fit in at our table.

01:47:57.865 --> 01:48:02.103
MATT: Yeah. I need you all to roll initiative,
please.

01:48:02.103 --> 01:48:05.017
SAM: Initiative! Roll for initiative!

01:48:05.017 --> 01:48:06.659
TRAVIS: Do I roll for Yasha, too?

01:48:06.659 --> 01:48:08.173
MATT: Yes, if you don't mind.

01:48:08.173 --> 01:48:13.103
TALIESIN: I will roll. (shouting) No! No!

01:48:13.103 --> 01:48:14.585
SAM: I'd better roll for Laura.

01:48:14.585 --> 01:48:16.257
TALIESIN: You roll for Laura, because I
shouldn't.

01:48:16.257 --> 01:48:17.795
MARISHA: I'm going to add my boots.

01:48:17.795 --> 01:48:21.652
MATT: What'd you roll for you? All right, starting
at the top. 25 to 20?

01:48:21.652 --> 01:48:23.834
TRAVIS: I rolled a natural 20.

01:48:23.834 --> 01:48:24.543
MATT: Nice!

01:48:24.543 --> 01:48:26.891
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yasha rolled a two.

01:48:26.891 --> 01:48:28.417
SAM: Classic Ashley.

01:48:32.707 --> 01:48:34.360
TRAVIS: This is weird.

01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.460
MATT: 25 to 20? He's the only one?

01:48:36.518 --> 01:48:38.020
TRAVIS: I'm the only 20?

01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:40.885
MATT: Okay. 20 to 15?

01:48:40.885 --> 01:48:42.453
MARISHA: 16.

01:48:42.453 --> 01:48:43.749
SAM: 16 here as well.

01:48:43.749 --> 01:48:44.980
MATT: All right.

01:48:51.436 --> 01:48:55.373
Okay. 15 to ten?

01:48:55.373 --> 01:48:57.640
LIAM: Zwölf. 12.

01:48:58.438 --> 01:48:59.945
SAM: Jester has 13.

01:49:05.734 --> 01:49:08.334
This is Sparta!

01:49:08.868 --> 01:49:10.075
LIAM: Madness!

01:49:10.075 --> 01:49:12.345
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll see real fast.

01:49:12.388 --> 01:49:13.635
TALIESIN: Three.

01:49:13.879 --> 01:49:15.483
MATT: What did Yasha roll, again?

01:49:15.483 --> 01:49:19.700
TRAVIS: Two, plus whatever her initiative bonus
is, which I don't know.

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.663
MARISHA: You, then Yasha?

01:49:21.663 --> 01:49:24.368
TALIESIN: I was about to say, we don't have her
iPad.

01:49:24.368 --> 01:49:26.814
SAM: We'll just make her last.

01:49:26.814 --> 01:49:30.982
MATT: I'd say it's a plus... let's say a plus
seven to hit. You know the rules for rage.

01:49:30.982 --> 01:49:32.329
TRAVIS: I do.

01:49:32.329 --> 01:49:37.302
MATT: We'll go with that. She does an
additional... You should probably pull up the

01:49:37.302 --> 01:49:40.364
stuff. That was something that should've done
during the break.

01:49:40.364 --> 01:49:43.169
SAM: Yeah, we said we were going to do that during
the break.

01:49:43.169 --> 01:49:47.700
MATT: Well, you did not. Now you don't have
Yasha's abilities. That's how it works out. Yasha

01:49:47.864 --> 01:49:53.282
will be doing some damage, if she gets there. All
right, so, top of the round. Fjord, in the middle

01:49:53.282 --> 01:49:58.416
of this chaos now breaking, the arrows being
flung, you are in the water and ten feet below the

01:49:58.416 --> 01:50:00.650
dock. What're you going to do?

01:50:00.650 --> 01:50:07.557
TRAVIS: All right. I'm going to use my bonus
action to use the single charge on Summer's Eve--

01:50:07.557 --> 01:50:13.425
doesn't use a spell slot-- to Misty Step from my
position in the water up to where Marius is.

01:50:13.425 --> 01:50:14.617
MATT: All right.

01:50:14.884 --> 01:50:16.456
SAM: Isn't Summer's Eve a douche?

01:50:16.456 --> 01:50:18.358
MARISHA: Yes, it is. I wasn't going to--

01:50:18.358 --> 01:50:20.841
TRAVIS: Summer's what? What's the name of the
sword?

01:50:20.841 --> 01:50:23.541
MARISHA: It's definitely for when your vajayjay
itches.

01:50:23.541 --> 01:50:26.471
MATT: Yeah, that's what it is. No, it's Summer's
Dance.

01:50:26.471 --> 01:50:27.816
TRAVIS: Summer's Dance!

01:50:27.816 --> 01:50:32.044
(laughter)

01:50:32.044 --> 01:50:35.573
TRAVIS: That's the best broadcast ever.

01:50:35.573 --> 01:50:37.653
MARISHA: Sponsor us, Summer's Eve!

01:50:37.653 --> 01:50:40.163
TRAVIS: Nope, it's Summer's Eve from now on.

01:50:40.163 --> 01:50:42.663
LIAM: Tell us about your patron, Fjord.

01:50:42.663 --> 01:50:46.462
(laughter)

01:50:46.462 --> 01:50:48.770
MARISHA: He smells of lavender and vanilla.

01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:50.567
TRAVIS: Oh my god, amazing.

01:50:50.567 --> 01:50:53.799
MATT: I love it. What is the--

01:50:53.799 --> 01:50:55.359
TRAVIS: 30 feet.

01:50:55.359 --> 01:50:58.805
MATT: Well, I was going to say, the Misty Step, is
it on a short rest or a long rest that it gets back?

01:50:58.925 --> 01:51:00.911
TRAVIS: It is every short or long rest.

01:51:00.911 --> 01:51:02.783
MATT: Gotcha, perfect.

01:51:02.783 --> 01:51:11.321
TRAVIS: With my action, I will use Thunder Step.
Well, I'll reach out and grab towards Marius and

01:51:11.321 --> 01:51:16.751
say, come with us, and cast Thunder Step. He has
to be willing to come with.

01:51:16.751 --> 01:51:19.998
MATT: All right, make a persuasion check with
disadvantage.

01:51:19.998 --> 01:51:21.469
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

01:51:21.469 --> 01:51:26.904
MATT: Yeah! Because you literally showed up,
ruined this whole deal he was about to make.

01:51:27.606 --> 01:51:29.766
LIAM: Come on, Fjordy.

01:51:29.766 --> 01:51:31.143
TRAVIS: That's a natural one.

01:51:31.143 --> 01:51:32.914
LIAM: (groans)

01:51:32.914 --> 01:51:34.236
MATT: He's not willing.

01:51:34.236 --> 01:51:36.371
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:51:36.371 --> 01:51:38.278
SAM: Is he the redhead there?

01:51:38.278 --> 01:51:39.623
LIAM: Yes, he's puffy pants.

01:51:39.623 --> 01:51:42.223
TRAVIS: Does it cancel out the spell or does it
still happen and he just doesn't come with?

01:51:42.223 --> 01:51:44.169
MATT: The spell still happens, he just doesn't
come with.

01:51:44.169 --> 01:51:47.528
TRAVIS: Well, that didn't work. I will--

01:51:47.528 --> 01:51:50.020
LAURA: Can you talk to him before you Thunder Step
back?

01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:51.685
MATT: He tried.

01:51:51.685 --> 01:51:54.689
TRAVIS: I did. I rolled a natural one. It was
great. He didn't want to come.

01:51:54.689 --> 01:51:56.289
TALIESIN: This is going great.

01:51:56.289 --> 01:51:58.340
TRAVIS: Yep. Par for the fucking course.

01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:00.036
LIAM: On brand.

01:52:00.036 --> 01:52:02.010
TRAVIS: Can I make it over to this dock over
here?

01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:03.715
MATT: How long is the--

01:52:03.715 --> 01:52:04.937
TRAVIS: 90 feet.

01:52:04.937 --> 01:52:10.780
MATT: 90 feet? Most likely, yeah. You have to
count it out. Yeah, easily, you can make it

01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:12.739
anywhere on that dock, pretty much.

01:52:12.739 --> 01:52:14.910
TALIESIN: That's 90 nautical feet.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.771
TRAVIS: That's 3d10 thunder damage.

01:52:24.599 --> 01:52:29.775
(counting) Eight points of thunder damage, woo.

01:52:29.775 --> 01:52:31.432
MATT: Well, it doesn't kill Marius, that's good.

01:52:31.432 --> 01:52:33.464
TRAVIS: That's good.

01:52:33.464 --> 01:52:40.863
MATT: All right, so there's this blast, this loud
thunderous sound, which may have gotten the

01:52:40.863 --> 01:52:44.487
attention of a nearby zhelezo or two.

01:52:44.487 --> 01:52:46.123
SAM: Oh boy.

01:52:47.643 --> 01:52:50.320
TRAVIS: Oh god. Where's the reset button?

01:52:51.696 --> 01:52:53.395
LAURA: Where's the save point?

01:52:53.395 --> 01:52:55.697
MARISHA: Yeah, can we load the latest save file?

01:52:55.697 --> 01:52:58.231
TRAVIS: Can we reach in the SNES, push the game up
and down?

01:52:58.231 --> 01:53:01.483
MATT: There's none in view currently, so you don't
know, it could be a while until one of them shows

01:53:01.483 --> 01:53:08.381
up. You get the sense that that was a loud noise,
because it's a Thunder Step. That ends your turn?

01:53:08.381 --> 01:53:10.930
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you can hear it within 300 feet,
so.

01:53:10.930 --> 01:53:18.152
MATT: Yeah. That ends your turn. That brings us
now to the bowmen. The bowmen, who--

01:53:18.152 --> 01:53:22.222
TRAVIS: Right here, put me out of my misery.

01:53:22.524 --> 01:53:26.873
MATT: No, actually. You showed up and made a
(poof), but they don't know where you showed up.

01:53:26.873 --> 01:53:28.372
You just vanished out of sight.

01:53:28.372 --> 01:53:29.855
TRAVIS: Because I was behind them, yeah.

01:53:29.855 --> 01:53:34.997
MATT: They're all going to focus on... On the one
they were already told to fire at, so they're all

01:53:34.997 --> 01:53:41.605
going to aim at Beau. That's going to be--
Actually, they had a hard time with you and you

01:53:41.605 --> 01:53:44.943
threw it back, so only one of them's going to fire
on you. The other two are going to fire at Caleb.

01:53:45.974 --> 01:53:47.814
Against Beau, that is--

01:53:47.814 --> 01:53:51.062
MARISHA: Can I try and like self-defense--defend
Caleb?

01:53:51.062 --> 01:53:52.182
SAM: Secret service?

01:53:52.182 --> 01:53:53.353
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:53:53.559 --> 01:53:54.647
MATT: 20 to hit.

01:53:54.647 --> 01:53:55.783
MARISHA: Hits.

01:53:55.783 --> 01:54:01.381
LIAM: I think I cast Mage Armor before going down
to the Sluice, but how much later is it? Is it

01:54:01.381 --> 01:54:03.385
beyond eight hours?

01:54:03.392 --> 01:54:08.773
MATT: At this point it's midnight. You guys went
there mid-afternoon, so it's been... Yeah, it's

01:54:08.773 --> 01:54:14.503
been past eight hours. That is four points of
damage to you, Beauregard.

01:54:14.503 --> 01:54:16.789
MARISHA: Zero points of damage to me.

01:54:16.789 --> 01:54:19.603
MATT: All righty. Then two attacks against you
Caleb.

01:54:20.064 --> 01:54:21.438
MARISHA: I can't like--

01:54:21.438 --> 01:54:23.105
MATT: Both are 15.

01:54:23.105 --> 01:54:27.220
LIAM: Well, I'll cast Shield. So they miss.

01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:30.291
MATT: They both splinter off of you, no issue.

01:54:30.291 --> 01:54:33.120
LAURA: Who am I after in the initiative?

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:38.213
MATT: You are after Beau and Nott, then other
characters go, and then your turn.

01:54:38.213 --> 01:54:39.991
LAURA: Okay.

01:54:39.991 --> 01:54:43.145
MATT: They're going to go ahead and-- This guy's
going to move up to the side here to get a better

01:54:43.145 --> 01:54:47.775
view of you. This guy's going to shift off to the
side. This guy's going to move up to the top to

01:54:47.775 --> 01:54:53.408
get a better view as well. The one that's moving
by is going to be like, "Quick, quick!" and he's

01:54:53.408 --> 01:55:00.172
like shouting down into the door that leads deeper
into the ship underneath the ladder right there.

01:55:00.172 --> 01:55:02.441
That brings us to Beau and Nott's turn.

01:55:02.441 --> 01:55:03.649
SAM: Take it away.

01:55:03.649 --> 01:55:06.353
MARISHA: You want to try to take out this guy in
front of me first, with your sneak attack, or do

01:55:06.353 --> 01:55:08.127
you want me to lean in on him?

01:55:08.127 --> 01:55:09.327
SAM: I mean... this big guy?

01:55:09.327 --> 01:55:10.665
MARISHA: The big guy that you're under.

01:55:10.665 --> 01:55:15.099
SAM: I mean, I can certainly try. I don't want
people to see me, but sure.

01:55:15.099 --> 01:55:19.694
MARISHA: Well, I could try to take him out, if you
want to try and go for someone else.

01:55:19.694 --> 01:55:24.846
SAM: You do your thing first. You just do your
thing first and I'll see where the chips fall.

01:55:24.846 --> 01:55:27.411
Also, Matt, which guy is our guy? The red?

01:55:27.411 --> 01:55:28.716
LIAM : The red.

01:55:28.716 --> 01:55:30.113
MATT: This guy is Marius.

01:55:30.113 --> 01:55:31.843
MARISHA: I shouldn't try anything fancy, right?

01:55:31.843 --> 01:55:34.347
LAURA: I think we should get the fuck out.

01:55:34.347 --> 01:55:37.125
MATT: Beau, it's your turn. What are you doing?

01:55:37.125 --> 01:55:40.487
MARISHA: I'm going to go up to this guy.

01:55:40.487 --> 01:55:43.457
MATT: Right here? All right, so you rush up to
him.

01:55:43.457 --> 01:55:44.927
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:55:48.104 --> 01:55:49.870
I'm going to attack him.

01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:51.901
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

01:55:53.931 --> 01:55:56.304
MARISHA: I don't know what to do. 12.

01:55:56.304 --> 01:56:01.422
MATT: 12 misses. You punch short. You swing and it
hits, but it hits his heavy splint armor and hurts

01:56:01.422 --> 01:56:06.123
your knuckles a bit, and he takes it. Now that
you're up in his face, you can see he's a big,

01:56:06.123 --> 01:56:13.357
imposing half-orc and currently looks to not feel
very threatened by you. That was your first attack.

01:56:14.254 --> 01:56:15.877
MARISHA: Hmm, going to try again.

01:56:15.877 --> 01:56:18.604
TRAVIS: We are missing a long rest. We could just
get the fuck out of here.

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:24.702
MARISHA: Yeah, but I don't know what I want to do,
though. Waiting for everybody else to run. 17.

01:56:24.702 --> 01:56:26.109
MATT: 17 just hits.

01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:29.003
TRAVIS. 17 just hits.

01:56:29.003 --> 01:56:30.358
SAM: Ooh, boy.

01:56:30.358 --> 01:56:34.171
MARISHA: Fuck, I think I was actually using the
wrong math on that last one, too, but that's okay.

01:56:35.581 --> 01:56:36.249
Okay.

01:56:38.221 --> 01:56:39.716
Fuck me, six damage.

01:56:39.716 --> 01:56:41.282
MATT: Six points of damage, all right.

01:56:41.282 --> 01:56:43.119
MARISHA: I'm going to try to Stunning Strike him.

01:56:43.119 --> 01:56:50.202
MATT: All right! That's a 17; 15 plus two on a
constitution save. So Stunning Strike, no effect,

01:56:50.202 --> 01:56:52.232
unfortunately.

01:56:52.232 --> 01:56:54.193
MARISHA: Cool, supes cool.

01:56:54.193 --> 01:56:56.268
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

01:56:56.268 --> 01:57:06.559
MARISHA: Yes, I do. I'm going to-- I can always
disengage and run; I'm fast as fuck-- spend

01:57:06.559 --> 01:57:09.973
another ki point to do Patient Defense and hold my
ground.

01:57:09.973 --> 01:57:12.189
MATT: Okay. You got it.

01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:14.589
MARISHA: Everyone else, please run.

01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:16.426
MATT: Nott?

01:57:16.426 --> 01:57:24.575
SAM: I'm going to look up above me and-- wait, he
doesn't see me yet, I think?

01:57:24.575 --> 01:57:26.554
MATT: As far as you know, he doesn't see you.

01:57:26.554 --> 01:57:35.251
SAM: Okay, so I'm going to scuttle away from him
across to that other box over there, across the

01:57:35.251 --> 01:57:42.830
dock there. And, as I'm running, I'll turn around
and fire once at the big guy. Still sneak attack

01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:45.423
because Marisha's engaged, right?

01:57:45.423 --> 01:57:47.217
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:57:47.217 --> 01:57:50.067
SAM: That is a 24 to hit!

01:57:50.067 --> 01:57:52.107
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
sneak attack damage.

01:57:52.107 --> 01:57:53.155
SAM: Yeah!

01:57:58.209 --> 01:58:02.706
(counting) 21 points of damage!

01:58:02.706 --> 01:58:09.771
MATT: 21 points of damage. You watch as he goes
from this arrogant, watching you flounder in front

01:58:09.771 --> 01:58:15.291
of him as he takes the blows and keeps grinning,
suddenly double over as the bolt is now deeply

01:58:15.291 --> 01:58:22.458
buried into his abdomen. Yeah, that was a pretty
tough hit. He's hurt!

01:58:22.458 --> 01:58:25.425
SAM: Then I will, bonus action, jump in that
box--

01:58:25.425 --> 01:58:26.794
(laughter)

01:58:26.794 --> 01:58:28.232
SAM: --and hide.

01:58:28.232 --> 01:58:29.959
MARISHA: Oh, that's so cute.

01:58:29.959 --> 01:58:31.323
MATT: (laughs) Roll a stealth check.

01:58:31.323 --> 01:58:32.895
MARISHA: Assassin's Creed.

01:58:32.895 --> 01:58:39.411
SAM: Ooh. Oh, wait, that's better than I thought.
It's 19. I'm wearing my thing, my hood. Do I get

01:58:39.411 --> 01:58:40.968
to roll again for stealth?

01:58:40.968 --> 01:58:42.211
MATT: Yeah, you do.

01:58:42.211 --> 01:58:43.880
LAURA: Oh, you already get advantage?

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:47.043
SAM: Still 19. Yes, you double-advantaged me.

01:58:47.043 --> 01:58:48.413
LAURA: What a stupid...

01:58:48.413 --> 01:58:52.930
MATT: (laughs) Now you know. All right, that ends
your guys' go. It is now the Enforcers' turn.

01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:55.104
SAM: The Enforcer!

01:58:55.104 --> 01:59:03.364
MATT: One Enforcer comes out of the center of the
ship and looks and sees this going. The guy up top

01:59:03.364 --> 01:59:05.797
goes, "Quick, burn it all!"

01:59:05.797 --> 01:59:07.039
MARISHA: What?

01:59:07.039 --> 01:59:10.833
MATT: This guy is going to go ahead and jump back
down into the ship.

01:59:10.833 --> 01:59:14.949
SAM: Burn it all? Ooh, they're carrying weed.

01:59:14.949 --> 01:59:16.550
(laughter)

01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:20.261
SAM: They think we're customs and they're going to
burn it!

01:59:20.261 --> 01:59:24.228
MATT: That Enforcer's going to pull out a hand
crossbow and is going to go ahead and take a shot

01:59:24.228 --> 01:59:29.461
at you, since you're off in that way. Has
disadvantage on the attack, but you're--right now--

01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:30.523
TRAVIS: He does?

01:59:30.523 --> 01:59:35.290
MATT: Because you're out of his range. He's going
to go ahead and grab and pull Marius towards the

01:59:35.290 --> 01:59:39.552
gang plank. He's going to go ahead and fire at
you.

01:59:41.867 --> 01:59:43.628
That's 15 to hit?

01:59:43.628 --> 01:59:44.569
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:59:44.569 --> 01:59:50.566
MATT: Misses, yeah. You (bash) with your shield.
Ricochets off, no issue. That's going to be the

01:59:50.566 --> 01:59:52.264
end of the Enforcers' turn. Jester, you're up.

01:59:52.264 --> 02:00:00.088
LAURA: Okay. Am I within 60 feet of this guy?

02:00:00.862 --> 02:00:05.074
MATT: You look like you're-- it's close.

02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:13.557
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to step forward a little
bit. There, there... sure.

02:00:13.557 --> 02:00:19.313
MATT: Okay. (counting) Yeah, he's within 60 feet.

02:00:19.313 --> 02:00:25.638
LAURA: Okay I'm going to cast Hold Person at third
level on both him and him.

02:00:25.638 --> 02:00:28.738
MATT and SAM: Ooh!

02:00:28.738 --> 02:00:35.102
MATT: All right. He-- the guy with Marius-- rolls
a natural 17. The guy next to Beau rolls a natural

02:00:35.128 --> 02:00:36.427
three.

02:00:36.427 --> 02:00:38.761
LAURA: Okay, well, he's paralyzed.

02:00:38.761 --> 02:00:40.923
MATT: (singing) Paralyzed.

02:00:42.543 --> 02:00:45.755
SAM: (singing) Para. Para. Paralyzed.

02:00:45.879 --> 02:00:52.370
MATT: You are currently concentrating there. The
big guy with the bolt in his stomach goes (groans)

02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:57.838
and his whole body locks up and you can see his
eyes go wild as he glances down at you, unable to

02:00:57.838 --> 02:01:01.702
move at all. Does that finish your turn? You can
keep moving the rest of your movement if you want to.

02:01:01.927 --> 02:01:08.287
LAURA: I'm going to back up and try to get around
that building if I can.

02:01:08.287 --> 02:01:09.590
MATT: Around here, you mean?

02:01:09.590 --> 02:01:10.965
LAURA: No, around the back of it.

02:01:10.965 --> 02:01:16.534
MATT: Okay. (counting) 25, 30. That's as far as
you can get with your movement. All right, that

02:01:16.534 --> 02:01:19.306
ends your go. That brings us to Caleb.

02:01:19.306 --> 02:01:28.772
LIAM: Yeah, okay. I start moving my hand in an
arcane motion and I reach back at that building

02:01:28.772 --> 02:01:37.223
over to my side there, and a crate full of food, a
wooden crate, starts to jiggle and rockets through

02:01:37.223 --> 02:01:43.261
the air at the held fool in front of Beauregard.
I'm casting Catapult at third level.

02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.361
SAM: Food fight!

02:01:45.361 --> 02:01:47.587
(laughter)

02:01:47.587 --> 02:01:52.526
LIAM: He automatically fails his dex save because
he is paralyzed. 5d8.

02:01:52.526 --> 02:01:55.643
SAM: 5d8 fruit damage?!

02:01:55.780 --> 02:02:03.465
MATT: Yep, from lobbing this stack of fruits and
heavy wooden boxes into his head.

02:02:03.465 --> 02:02:05.709
MARISHA: It was a drive-by fruiting.

02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:13.419
LIAM: A couple things. 30 points of damage. That's
a transmutation spell, so I can shuttle a little

02:02:13.419 --> 02:02:18.294
bit of arcane energy into my Transmuter's Stone,
and I'm going to change its property from dark

02:02:18.294 --> 02:02:23.884
vision into advantage on concentration checks. I'm
going to back the fuck up towards that house, as

02:02:23.884 --> 02:02:25.285
far as I can go.

02:02:25.285 --> 02:02:27.227
SAM: Wow. Wizards.

02:02:27.227 --> 02:02:32.354
MATT: All right. As the crates slam into him, the
body rocks back for a minute, but is still holding

02:02:32.354 --> 02:02:36.544
itself in place. Right now there's splinters of
wood sticking out of his armor, his jaw is all

02:02:36.544 --> 02:02:46.244
messed up. The hood gets blown back and you can
see the grayish hair that's tangled and sea

02:02:46.244 --> 02:02:52.356
air-matted that is now streaked with blood from
the impact. Bits of his face are covered in gore.

02:02:52.356 --> 02:02:54.629
He's looking pretty hurt.

02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:56.623
MARISHA: This guy's real beefy, though.

02:02:56.623 --> 02:03:02.109
MATT: He's also taken a rough round. This has not
gone well.

02:03:02.109 --> 02:03:04.495
MARISHA: Yeah, but we don't want to fight all of
them.

02:03:04.495 --> 02:03:06.893
MATT: All right, so Caleb, that ends your turn?

02:03:06.893 --> 02:03:07.934
LIAM: Yeah.

02:03:07.934 --> 02:03:12.984
MATT: It's now the captain's turn... who is
paralyzed. His really, really cool round that he

02:03:12.984 --> 02:03:18.650
was going to do that was going to be really
awesome doesn't happen because he's fighting

02:03:18.650 --> 02:03:21.455
against the spell. He's going to make his save.

02:03:21.455 --> 02:03:23.655
SAM: Why do we have to run? Seems like we're
winning.

02:03:23.655 --> 02:03:25.061
TALIESIN: There's more of them.

02:03:25.061 --> 02:03:26.817
SAM: They're burning marijuana.

02:03:26.817 --> 02:03:28.751
MARISHA: What are they burning, though?

02:03:28.751 --> 02:03:32.304
LAURA: We could've found out if we wouldn't have
been stupid.

02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:35.433
LIAM: There's five people we can see, one dude in
the boat down below.

02:03:35.433 --> 02:03:38.771
MATT: He's going to make a wisdom save to see if
he can resist the--

02:03:38.771 --> 02:03:40.543
SAM: There's like nine of us.

02:03:41.003 --> 02:03:44.506
MATT: That's a 12. He did not save. He's still
held.

02:03:44.654 --> 02:03:45.878
TRAVIS: Nice!

02:03:46.711 --> 02:03:48.743
MATT: All right. That brings us to Caduceus.

02:03:48.743 --> 02:03:51.776
TALIESIN: Oh boy, that is a lot happening.

02:03:51.776 --> 02:03:54.829
TRAVIS: Boil their flesh, Caduceus, let's go. Do
it. Bring it.

02:03:54.829 --> 02:04:05.483
TALIESIN: All right let's-- yeah, this'll be fun.
That's all taken care of. I'm going to cast a--

02:04:10.063 --> 02:04:11.865
Guiding Bolt, I guess?

02:04:12.087 --> 02:04:13.481
MATT: Okay, towards?

02:04:13.481 --> 02:04:18.749
TALIESIN: Towards the guy standing next to-- the
guy standing next to Marius.

02:04:18.861 --> 02:04:23.518
MATT: All right, go ahead and make the ranged
attack roll. You're casting it at first level?

02:04:23.518 --> 02:04:24.541
TALIESIN: First level.

02:04:24.541 --> 02:04:25.865
MATT: All right.

02:04:25.865 --> 02:04:31.509
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a-- what is the ranged
attack on that?

02:04:31.509 --> 02:04:34.361
MATT: Guiding Bolt, I think, is 120 feet. I think
it's pretty far.

02:04:34.361 --> 02:04:37.762
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, it's very far. Just a ranged
attack.

02:04:40.648 --> 02:04:41.865
23 to hit.

02:04:41.865 --> 02:04:43.341
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

02:04:43.585 --> 02:04:44.741
TALIESIN: 25.

02:04:44.741 --> 02:04:46.290
MATT: He's only wearing leather armor.

02:04:46.290 --> 02:04:54.849
TALIESIN: I'm at 51 hit points. I'm fine. Oh yeah,
so that's-- where is that? 4d6, okay.

02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:06.671
Ooh! 15 points of damage.

02:05:06.939 --> 02:05:07.872
MATT: Nice!

02:05:07.872 --> 02:05:09.093
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:05:09.093 --> 02:05:14.211
MATT: The bolt hits him and and you see now this
vibrant glow as the impact-- the energy forms

02:05:14.211 --> 02:05:17.814
around his chest, creating this beacon. The next
attack against that Enforcer right on the

02:05:17.814 --> 02:05:25.002
gangplank has advantage. He's pretty visibly hurt.
He's not on his last legs or anything, but he's

02:05:25.002 --> 02:05:26.700
taken some wear and tear.

02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:28.236
TALIESIN: I'm going to vanish.

02:05:28.236 --> 02:05:30.071
SAM: You can do that?

02:05:30.071 --> 02:05:31.321
TALIESIN: I can do that.

02:05:31.321 --> 02:05:32.630
MATT: As a bonus action?

02:05:32.630 --> 02:05:37.345
TALIESIN: I believe so. I'm double-checking. I can
do Hidden Step as a bonus action.

02:05:37.345 --> 02:05:38.695
MATT: Go for it.

02:05:43.555 --> 02:05:46.964
SAM: So many steps. Misty, hidden, thunder.

02:05:48.592 --> 02:05:57.845
TALIESIN: I'm going to move off in that direction,
if that's okay.

02:05:57.845 --> 02:05:59.157
MATT: Full movement?

02:05:59.157 --> 02:06:01.100
TALIESIN: Let's go full movement.

02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:05.838
MATT: There? Okay, there you go. You are not
visible at the moment. That finishes Caduceus'

02:06:05.838 --> 02:06:07.432
turn. Yasha's up.

02:06:07.432 --> 02:06:11.443
TRAVIS: Yasha, seeing all these arrows fly at
Beau, she would like to rage.

02:06:11.443 --> 02:06:12.677
MATT: Understood.

02:06:12.677 --> 02:06:16.310
TRAVIS: She will rush up next to Beau towards the
half-orc captain.

02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:18.510
LIAM: Sentinel babes.

02:06:18.510 --> 02:06:20.311
MATT: Easy enough to do.

02:06:20.311 --> 02:06:22.729
TRAVIS: Beautiful. She will make-- does she get
two attacks?

02:06:22.729 --> 02:06:24.212
MATT: She does. She gets two.

02:06:24.212 --> 02:06:26.620
TRAVIS: Two reckless attacks against the half
orc.

02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:30.573
MATT: I mean, you can. Go for it. She has
advantage on him, because he's paralyzed.

02:06:30.573 --> 02:06:33.982
TRAVIS: Oh! Then we'll make it regular so that he
doesn't get advantage back.

02:06:33.982 --> 02:06:39.056
LAURA: Doesn't everybody get advantage on attacks
against her, too? That would suck with the arrows.

02:06:39.056 --> 02:06:40.428
TRAVIS: Only the person you attack.

02:06:40.428 --> 02:06:41.328
LAURA: Oh, really?

02:06:41.328 --> 02:06:42.862
MATT: No, reckless, any attacks against you.

02:06:42.862 --> 02:06:44.373
TRAVIS: Any attacks against you.

02:06:44.373 --> 02:06:46.901
MATT: Yeah. It's been a while since you've been
reckless. It's fine.

02:06:47.029 --> 02:06:49.255
TRAVIS: Been a while! That's a... 19?

02:06:49.255 --> 02:06:52.250
MATT: That hits and that is an auto-crit because
he's paralyzed.

02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:55.222
TRAVIS: Ooh. The second one is a 12.

02:06:55.222 --> 02:06:59.506
MATT: 12 does not hit. Unfortunately.

02:06:59.506 --> 02:07:03.237
TRAVIS: She rolls-- what is it, 2d6, maybe?

02:07:03.392 --> 02:07:05.434
MATT: For her, as a--

02:07:06.555 --> 02:07:08.950
LIAM: She's going to carve him like a Thanksgiving
turkey.

02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:27.033
MATT: Yeah, that's going to be bad for him. This
is for the zealot. There we go. The first hit

02:07:27.033 --> 02:07:34.527
equals 1d6 plus half your-- okay, so it's 2d6 plus
six damage.

02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:37.933
TRAVIS: 15.

02:07:37.933 --> 02:07:40.579
MATT: The dice are doubled. Plus an additional
d6.

02:07:40.579 --> 02:07:46.053
TRAVIS: 18 plus six is 24, plus an additional d6.

02:07:46.053 --> 02:07:47.484
MATT: That's doubled.

02:07:47.484 --> 02:07:50.119
TRAVIS: That's two. What did I say?

02:07:50.119 --> 02:07:52.154
MATT: 26, I think?

02:07:52.154 --> 02:07:53.395
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:07:53.395 --> 02:07:57.824
MATT: That's 28 plus six for her barbarian level.
Yeah, she just eviscerates him.

02:07:57.824 --> 02:07:59.554
TRAVIS: Nice!

02:07:59.554 --> 02:08:07.649
MATT: Man. As he's there, frozen in place, Yasha's
rushed up and cleaves right through his chest, and

02:08:07.649 --> 02:08:13.885
you watch as he folds into two pieces, both
tumbling off into the water. There's now two

02:08:13.885 --> 02:08:17.658
halves of the orc floating in the water below.

02:08:17.658 --> 02:08:19.586
TRAVIS: "You okay?"

02:08:19.586 --> 02:08:21.237
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:08:21.237 --> 02:08:22.810
(laughter)

02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:24.615
MARISHA: Wow, Yasha. Man.

02:08:24.615 --> 02:08:25.787
MATT: All right. Fjord, you're up.

02:08:25.787 --> 02:08:27.059
LIAM: Another layer of insanity.

02:08:27.217 --> 02:08:28.401
TRAVIS: Oh, it's me?

02:08:28.401 --> 02:08:30.503
MARISHA: Just fucked my head even more.

02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:38.402
TRAVIS: You know what? Fuck it. I'll use my last
spell slot to cast Hypnotic Pattern. I will make

02:08:38.402 --> 02:08:44.975
it in the shape of the cat's eye sphere above the
ship so that everyone can see it.

02:08:44.975 --> 02:08:47.941
LAURA: Hypnotic Pattern? What is that?

02:08:47.985 --> 02:08:49.453
TRAVIS: It's brand new.

02:08:49.453 --> 02:08:57.458
MATT: Yeah, that'll get-- you can't get everybody
in the ship. You'd be missing either the guy at

02:08:57.458 --> 02:08:59.688
the front or the guy at the back. Which one do you
want to--?

02:08:59.688 --> 02:09:01.355
TRAVIS: I'll miss the guy at the back.

02:09:01.355 --> 02:09:04.028
MATT: Okay, so the front, then. That's a wisdom
saving throw.

02:09:04.028 --> 02:09:06.831
TRAVIS: Yes. 15 is the save.

02:09:06.831 --> 02:09:13.903
MATT: That is a 15. 13 plus two. The guy at the
front resists. Next guy behind him: natural 16

02:09:13.903 --> 02:09:26.852
plus two. He resists. The guy next to Marius
fails, and Marius fails. You watch as both Marius

02:09:26.852 --> 02:09:34.788
and the Enforcer standing on the gangplank, their
faces immediately go dull as they stare up at

02:09:34.788 --> 02:09:39.394
this-- what you see as nothing. You have no visual
perspective on what's happening, but suddenly they

02:09:39.394 --> 02:09:44.892
both go slack-jawed and stand staring up in the
air at this empty space.

02:09:44.892 --> 02:09:49.680
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're incapacitated. Their speed
is zero. But if they take damage or if someone

02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:53.699
else uses an action to shake the creature out of
their stupor, then they (confused noises).

02:09:53.699 --> 02:09:56.039
MARISHA: You just spiked their drinks, basically.

02:09:56.039 --> 02:09:59.179
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've bascially Thundercat Ho'd the
eye up into the--

02:09:59.179 --> 02:10:02.915
MATT: Yeah, kind of. All right, so that's your
action?

02:10:02.915 --> 02:10:04.429
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:10:04.429 --> 02:10:05.889
MATT: Anything with your movement?

02:10:10.459 --> 02:10:13.298
TRAVIS: Nope, I'll come over here.

02:10:13.459 --> 02:10:17.442
MATT: All right. You make your way to the edge of
the dock right there. Perfect. All right, that

02:10:17.442 --> 02:10:27.647
ends your turn. It's now the bowmen's turn. Seeing
you now casting the spell, making a ruckus on the

02:10:27.647 --> 02:10:35.064
dock nearby, all three of them turn to face you.
This guy's going to go ahead and shift over and

02:10:35.064 --> 02:10:37.772
get a bit closer to the edge, and all three of
them are going to fire at you, Fjord.

02:10:37.772 --> 02:10:39.268
SAM: Oh no!

02:10:39.268 --> 02:10:41.060
MARISHA: What if we commandeered the ship?

02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:43.032
SAM: Yeah! Become pirates.

02:10:43.032 --> 02:10:44.529
MATT: Natural 20 on the first hit.

02:10:44.529 --> 02:10:47.061
MARISHA: What if we don't commandeer the ship?

02:10:47.061 --> 02:10:50.503
TALIESIN: 25, 30. I'm within 30 feet of--

02:10:50.503 --> 02:10:51.898
MATT: Of none of them.

02:10:51.898 --> 02:10:55.565
TALIESIN: None of them? I've got to be them, not
Fjord, right? Okay, never mind. I'll

02:10:55.565 --> 02:10:56.833
double-check.

02:10:56.833 --> 02:11:03.343
MATT: Double-check that just in case. The next hit
against you is 17 plus four.

02:11:03.343 --> 02:11:05.299
TRAVIS: That hits. 17 is my armor class.

02:11:05.299 --> 02:11:06.984
TALIESIN: Suffers a critical hit.

02:11:06.984 --> 02:11:10.649
MATT: Oh, suffers? You can remove that. Okay, and
that's a natural 17 plus four.

02:11:10.649 --> 02:11:11.817
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:11:11.817 --> 02:11:15.626
MATT: All three hit you. The crit is not a crit
thanks to Caduceus.

02:11:19.512 --> 02:11:21.908
That's going to be six points

02:11:22.075 --> 02:11:27.647
of piercing damage, seven points of piercing
damage, and seven points of piercing damage.

02:11:28.036 --> 02:11:32.946
(arrows impacting) They're going to go ahead and
then use their movement to back up a bit back into

02:11:32.946 --> 02:11:34.357
the ship.

02:11:39.536 --> 02:11:44.494
This guy's going to duck below over
here. They all duck low and they're all going to

02:11:44.494 --> 02:11:46.140
attempt to hide.

02:11:46.363 --> 02:11:48.557
SAM: Nice. Smart kids.

02:11:50.187 --> 02:11:57.375
MATT: Okay. You watch as they all disappear into
the shadows of the ship's deck. You're uncertain

02:11:57.375 --> 02:12:01.956
where the bowmen are. That brings us to Beau and
Nott.

02:12:03.436 --> 02:12:05.330
MARISHA: Are we going in?

02:12:06.172 --> 02:12:07.346
SAM: I guess?

02:12:07.346 --> 02:12:09.601
LAURA: Just try to get Marius out, right?

02:12:09.601 --> 02:12:13.600
SAM: I'm hiding still, so I'm going to pop up and
shoot the guy next to Marius.

02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:15.108
MATT: Go for it.

02:12:16.954 --> 02:12:22.804
SAM: That is a lot. 20-something. 24 to hit.
Again.

02:12:22.804 --> 02:12:25.038
MATT: 24 to hit? Yeah, that hits.

02:12:25.038 --> 02:12:29.054
LAURA: Is it advantage because he's
incapacitated?

02:12:29.054 --> 02:12:31.903
MATT: Yeah, it's advantage to hit, so you can roll
twice, sorry.

02:12:31.903 --> 02:12:33.127
SAM: Same roll.

02:12:33.127 --> 02:12:34.583
MATT: There you go.

02:12:34.583 --> 02:12:36.188
SAM: Is it sneak attack?

02:12:36.188 --> 02:12:38.424
MATT: Because he's not aware that you were there,
and you were hidden? Yes.

02:12:38.424 --> 02:12:39.636
SAM: Yeah.

02:12:43.072 --> 02:12:44.600
20 points of damage.

02:12:44.845 --> 02:12:53.058
MATT: Nice. He immediately breaks out of the
stupor, glances over and looks at you, and he's

02:12:53.058 --> 02:12:58.257
hurt pretty bad. He's glancing over in your
direction, looking at the rest of everyone there,

02:12:58.257 --> 02:13:03.005
seeing how things are shifting. Looking to his
ship, he looks like he's planning something. What

02:13:03.005 --> 02:13:05.253
else are you going to do?

02:13:05.253 --> 02:13:06.842
SAM: Bonus action. I'll shoot him again.

02:13:07.083 --> 02:13:08.128
MATT: Go for it.

02:13:09.531 --> 02:13:11.637
SAM: Not as good. 17 to hit.

02:13:11.637 --> 02:13:14.038
MATT: 17 to hit? That still hits.

02:13:14.038 --> 02:13:17.347
SAM: Yeah. Eight more points of damage.

02:13:17.347 --> 02:13:18.983
MATT: (death groans)

02:13:18.983 --> 02:13:20.313
(cheering)

02:13:20.313 --> 02:13:22.648
MATT: He tumbles forward over and falls into the
water.

02:13:26.498 --> 02:13:30.094
TRAVIS: Oh man, we might get lucky. Marius!

02:13:30.381 --> 02:13:31.598
MATT: Marius, no!

02:13:31.598 --> 02:13:33.595
SAM: Oh no, I shot the wrong guy!

02:13:33.595 --> 02:13:38.130
MATT: Marius is still just standing there in the
middle of the gangplank, looking upward, going--

02:13:38.130 --> 02:13:39.931
All right.

02:13:39.931 --> 02:13:42.196
MARISHA: How do we get Marius out?

02:13:42.196 --> 02:13:45.498
SAM: I'll run towards Marius, but stop around that
box.

02:13:46.848 --> 02:13:48.913
MARISHA: Do you have a situation?

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:51.528
LAURA: Well, I was just thinking we could--

02:13:51.528 --> 02:13:52.494
SAM: That's it.

02:13:52.494 --> 02:13:53.583
MATT: Beau?

02:13:53.583 --> 02:13:57.455
LAURA: What's his name? What's the guy-- Orly? Say
Orly sent us and try to get out.

02:13:57.455 --> 02:13:59.492
TRAVIS: If Marius is incapacitated.

02:13:59.492 --> 02:14:00.650
MATT: They don't know that.

02:14:00.650 --> 02:14:01.863
LAURA: Shake him out.

02:14:01.863 --> 02:14:02.726
MATT: They don't know this ability.

02:14:02.726 --> 02:14:04.199
SAM: Beau!

02:14:04.199 --> 02:14:14.606
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to run towards Marius.

02:14:14.606 --> 02:14:17.516
MATT: All right. (counting)

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:19.314
MARISHA: Got 45 speed.

02:14:19.314 --> 02:14:25.747
MATT You're not quite adjacent-- you're not quite
up to him, but you're ten feet away from him.

02:14:25.747 --> 02:14:29.059
MARISHA: I have an extra five feet of movement. 45
speed.

02:14:29.059 --> 02:14:30.113
MATT: 45 speed?

02:14:30.113 --> 02:14:30.945
MARISHA: Yes.

02:14:30.945 --> 02:14:32.316
MATT: Oh, I thought it was 40.

02:14:32.316 --> 02:14:35.160
MARISHA: I got that in my extra monk level when I
leveled up.

02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.866
SAM: (yelling) Oh no, you killed her!

02:14:36.866 --> 02:14:38.629
(laughter)

02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:41.035
TRAVIS: She slips on some slick dock wood and
slides right into him.

02:14:41.035 --> 02:14:43.433
MATT: It's a rough night out here in Nicodranas.

02:14:43.433 --> 02:14:44.691
(laughter)

02:14:44.691 --> 02:14:45.698
MATT: There we go.

02:14:45.698 --> 02:14:47.534
TRAVIS: Fucking power plants are shutting down--

02:14:47.576 --> 02:14:50.076
MATT: There you go. You're up on the gangplank
with him now.

02:14:50.076 --> 02:15:01.349
MARISHA: Can I grab him and tackle him down behind
these barrels? Can I try and drag him back?

02:15:01.349 --> 02:15:03.746
MATT: You can use your action to grapple, if you
want to.

02:15:03.746 --> 02:15:04.895
MARISHA: I do that.

02:15:04.895 --> 02:15:06.660
MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check.

02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:12.732
LIAM: Come on, monk. Come on, M! Aw, you didn't
come on.

02:15:12.963 --> 02:15:17.310
MARISHA: But like, why? Why are my rolls so
garbage?

02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:18.845
LAURA: Do you get advantage because he's
incapacitated?

02:15:18.845 --> 02:15:20.343
MARISHA: Do I get advantage because he's
incapacitated?

02:15:20.343 --> 02:15:24.445
MATT: No, it doesn't matter; you have him. I just
wanted to see you roll. He's not fighting at all.

02:15:24.445 --> 02:15:27.801
He's literally just standing there going-- you
grab him.

02:15:27.801 --> 02:15:29.745
TRAVIS: I just wanted to see you roll!

02:15:29.745 --> 02:15:39.565
MARISHA: Fucker. Okay, I grab him. Can I use my
bonus action to try and drag him back?

02:15:39.565 --> 02:15:43.507
MATT: Do you have a ki point?

02:15:43.507 --> 02:15:46.741
MARISHA: I do. Can I do Step of the Wind and then
fucking move him back?

02:15:46.741 --> 02:15:49.190
MATT: You can. You have to pull him back at half
speed, but yeah.

02:15:49.190 --> 02:15:55.852
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to come up behind him and
grapple him and put my staff around his throat,

02:15:55.852 --> 02:15:58.631
making eye contact with everybody else.

02:15:58.631 --> 02:16:00.693
SAM: We're friends! (choking)

02:16:00.693 --> 02:16:02.684
MARISHA: Yeah. I back up.

02:16:02.684 --> 02:16:04.586
MATT: I'll say that knocks him out of his stupor.

02:16:04.586 --> 02:16:08.136
MARISHA: Well. You know, okay.

02:16:08.136 --> 02:16:10.547
MATT: When you're choking him and forcing to pull
him backwards--

02:16:10.547 --> 02:16:12.676
MARISHA: Well, you said grapple.

02:16:12.676 --> 02:16:17.126
MATT: Yeah. But grapple by putting your staff into
his throat and pulling him backwards--

02:16:17.126 --> 02:16:18.550
LAURA: It's different.

02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:20.058
SAM: It's a pretty harsh grapple.

02:16:20.058 --> 02:16:21.687
LIAM: Pretty harsh woman.

02:16:21.687 --> 02:16:23.058
LAURA: She's a harsh girl.

02:16:23.058 --> 02:16:25.806
MATT: You've pulled Marius back.

02:16:25.806 --> 02:16:27.887
MARISHA: Not a subtle person.

02:16:27.887 --> 02:16:30.088
LIAM: Whatever Mama wants, Mama gets.

02:16:30.088 --> 02:16:33.779
MARISHA: That's my turn. I've got Marius!
I've got Marius!

02:16:33.779 --> 02:16:36.825
MATT: All right, that finishes Beau's turn. That
finishes Nott's turn, now it's the Enforcers'

02:16:36.876 --> 02:16:43.564
turn. One Enforcer fell over, keeled over, dead.
The other one is going to step back out from the

02:16:43.564 --> 02:16:52.530
inside for a second. He's carrying a heavy
crossbow that he has winched back. Pulls it up

02:16:52.663 --> 02:16:58.766
and is going to spin and-- the first person he
sees coming out of there is probably going to be

02:16:58.766 --> 02:17:03.631
you, Beau, because you are the one who's grabbing
him and pulling him off the gangplank as he steps

02:17:03.631 --> 02:17:05.494
out and looks and sees you.

02:17:05.494 --> 02:17:10.768
MARISHA: Do I have three-quarters cover? Because
I'm using him as a human shield?

02:17:10.768 --> 02:17:15.378
MATT: I'd say you have half cover because of the
boxes that you've pulled up behind. Unless you

02:17:15.378 --> 02:17:19.162
want to use him as a human shield? That's up to
you.

02:17:19.162 --> 02:17:24.762
SAM: We're here to save you! Oh god! Block his
arrow for me!

02:17:24.762 --> 02:17:27.323
TALIESIN: Everyone has to pull their weight, man.

02:17:27.323 --> 02:17:36.295
MATT: He gets two shots. Natural 20 and a 17,
which I don't think hits, right?

02:17:36.295 --> 02:17:37.380
MARISHA: Misses.

02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:46.928
MATT: Yep. That is 20 points of piercing damage.

02:17:47.233 --> 02:17:48.692
MARISHA: Do I get deflect missiles?

02:17:48.692 --> 02:17:49.927
MATT: You have a reaction still, right?

02:17:49.927 --> 02:17:52.730
MARISHA: Yes I do. Okay, 15.

02:17:52.730 --> 02:17:55.673
MATT: You take nine points-- 15?

02:17:55.673 --> 02:17:59.793
MARISHA: Yeah. Five plus my monk level plus
dex, right?

02:17:59.793 --> 02:18:02.549
MATT: Is that how much it reduces it by, total?

02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:07.620
LIAM: Just look through our 2000 rules here, wait
a second.

02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:09.294
MATT: I know, that's fine.

02:18:09.294 --> 02:18:11.543
MARISHA: Oh, and it's also a 1d10; I just rolled a
1d8.

02:18:11.543 --> 02:18:16.064
MATT: Okay, reroll. 1d10 plus your monk level plus
your dexterity?

02:18:16.064 --> 02:18:21.616
MARISHA: Right. See, this is old, but it's-- or is
it my proficiency bonus?

02:18:21.616 --> 02:18:24.186
MATT: No, it's monk level and dexterity, you're
right. You totally got it, go for it.

02:18:24.186 --> 02:18:30.010
MARISHA: Okay, I'm not a crazy person. It's not as
good, but 13.

02:18:30.010 --> 02:18:41.405
MATT: All right, you take seven points of piercing
damage. That ends that. That brings us to Caleb.

02:18:41.405 --> 02:18:43.995
No sorry, Jester, you're up first, then Caleb.

02:18:43.995 --> 02:18:45.767
MARISHA: Jester, help.

02:18:45.767 --> 02:18:49.031
LAURA: Okay, you're right. Are you hurting?

02:18:49.031 --> 02:18:56.978
MARISHA: No, I'm just-- I mean, I'm not-- I'm
okay.

02:18:56.978 --> 02:19:05.301
LAURA: I guess-- this is really hard.

02:19:05.301 --> 02:19:10.531
MARISHA: Any assistance getting Marius out?

02:19:10.531 --> 02:19:15.107
LAURA: I don't have anything that's going to help
get him out that I can think of.

02:19:15.107 --> 02:19:21.550
MARISHA: Yeah, if you keep them away, Yasha and I
can make it work.

02:19:21.550 --> 02:19:33.700
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast-- fuck. I'll move
forward-- well, yeah, to be closer to Beau, and

02:19:33.963 --> 02:19:37.102
I'm going to cast-- fuck it-- Sanctuary.

02:19:37.102 --> 02:19:38.662
MATT: On Beau?

02:19:38.662 --> 02:19:40.969
LAURA: Yeah.

02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:43.457
MATT: All righty.

02:19:43.457 --> 02:19:45.435
SAM: (like Laura) Yeah.

02:19:45.435 --> 02:19:49.694
LIAM: Do you resurrect him?
(Eeyore voice) I guess.

02:19:49.694 --> 02:19:57.996
LAURA: Yeah, Sanctuary on Beau, so anybody that
makes an attack against her has to either--

02:19:57.996 --> 02:20:03.987
whatever, you know the spell. Then I'm going to--
sorry, that's a bonus action.

02:20:03.987 --> 02:20:05.404
SAM: Eeyore casts it.

02:20:05.404 --> 02:20:07.251
MATT: I know, seriously.

02:20:07.251 --> 02:20:10.152
SAM: (as Eeyore) You know, anyone who tries to
kill her can.

02:20:10.152 --> 02:20:13.150
LAURA: I'm freaking out! I don't know what to do!

02:20:13.150 --> 02:20:15.588
LIAM: (as Eeyore) It doesn't matter anyway.

02:20:15.588 --> 02:20:19.210
SAM: (as Eeyore) We're all going to die in the
end.

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:25.183
LAURA: Then I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at--
can I see anybody on the boat?

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:28.988
MATT: Right now, you can see one guy on the boat.

02:20:28.988 --> 02:20:30.886
LAURA: I guess I'm going to try to hit him.

02:20:30.886 --> 02:20:32.901
MATT: What's the range on Sacred Flame?

02:20:32.901 --> 02:20:34.617
LAURA: 60 feet.

02:20:34.617 --> 02:20:37.536
MATT: He gets a what save? Is it constitution or
is it wisdom?

02:20:37.536 --> 02:20:38.800
LAURA: A dex.

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:42.410
MATT: Oh, a dex. That would be 13; that's a
failure.

02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:44.533
TRAVIS: Sacred Flame making it through!

02:20:44.533 --> 02:20:50.525
LAURA: Woo! Six points of damage. Yeah, Hold
Person, that was a good one.

02:20:50.525 --> 02:20:52.966
LIAM: Yes, it was. That was a good move.

02:20:52.966 --> 02:20:54.337
MATT: It's all good. It was a good move.

02:20:54.337 --> 02:20:58.971
LAURA: Then I'm going to use the rest of my
movement to go back to where I was.

02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:01.771
MATT: That's as far as you go. You used the rest
of your movement to get up to that point.

02:21:01.771 --> 02:21:02.868
LAURA: Cool.

02:21:02.868 --> 02:21:04.890
MATT: That ends your go. Caleb, you're up.

02:21:04.890 --> 02:21:10.380
LIAM: Okay, so factoring in a couple of things.
One is that I see my friend Beauregard getting

02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:15.615
hammered on by them, which I do not like. Also, I
heard some voice from the boat yell out, "Burn

02:21:15.615 --> 02:21:27.108
"it," so out comes the bat guano and sulfur, and
slap, and a beam rockets out, 150-foot range, to

02:21:27.108 --> 02:21:30.842
about here, and erupts.

02:21:30.842 --> 02:21:34.302
TRAVIS: Please be shipping black powder.

02:21:34.302 --> 02:21:39.656
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (explosions)

02:21:39.656 --> 02:21:43.825
SAM: We're killing everyone on the boat. We don't
even know who they are!

02:21:43.825 --> 02:21:46.565
TRAVIS: Who gives a shit? They deserve to die!

02:21:46.565 --> 02:21:53.200
MATT: This is not a moral group by any stretch of
the imagination. They're getting better than they

02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:55.372
used to be, but man.

02:21:55.372 --> 02:22:02.797
LIAM: Yeah, Vox Machina is gone. The point is to
get it to a range where I know that it's not going

02:22:02.797 --> 02:22:05.202
to affect them on the dock. It's going to hit the
boat.

02:22:05.202 --> 02:22:09.733
MATT: You're getting the boat in this, too? All
right. Let's do it.

02:22:09.733 --> 02:22:12.321
SAM: To get the people, yeah, you've got to get
the boat.

02:22:12.727 --> 02:22:19.255
LIAM: Yeah, absolutely. What am I, a surgeon? I
have a 3rd-level spell because I used arcane

02:22:19.255 --> 02:22:21.409
recovery back at the chateau.

02:22:21.409 --> 02:22:25.039
MATT: Okay. Specify that next time, but sure, go
for it. I know you would.

02:22:25.039 --> 02:22:26.787
LIAM: I also took a poop while at the chateau, but
I thought I didn't--

02:22:26.787 --> 02:22:28.722
MATT: I know, that's fine.

02:22:28.722 --> 02:22:32.320
TRAVIS: I hope there's nobody important in the bow
of the ship.

02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:35.465
TALIESIN: There's so many things that could be
going horribly wrong right now.

02:22:35.465 --> 02:22:39.605
MARISHA: Yeah. A bunch of refugees wanting safe
passage.

02:22:39.605 --> 02:22:42.592
SAM: Don't worry, Sabian is hanging out below
decks.

02:22:42.592 --> 02:22:48.611
LAURA: Is there any way to see what the name of
that ship is? Is it on the side of the ship at all?

02:22:49.403 --> 02:22:52.515
MATT: You'd have to spend an action to look for
it. The name would be towards the back, and it's

02:22:52.515 --> 02:22:54.811
facing away from you.

02:22:54.811 --> 02:22:57.485
TRAVIS: He would've painted that shit on there. I
don't see it in there.

02:22:57.485 --> 02:23:00.578
MARISHA: Everywhere, on every panel.

02:23:00.578 --> 02:23:02.032
LIAM: 27.

02:23:02.032 --> 02:23:14.449
MATT: The Enforcer fails, so he takes the full 27.
Success, success, and failure.

02:23:14.449 --> 02:23:19.988
LIAM: I will use my movement to step around the
corner of the house and I will begin to count to

02:23:19.988 --> 02:23:22.748
20 slowly in Zemnian to calm my nerves.

02:23:22.748 --> 02:23:31.029
MATT: You move behind here. I'm going to roll a
saving throw for the ship's sails. Not bad. The

02:23:31.029 --> 02:23:36.976
sails do not catch fire. They're charred a little
bit from underneath, but the ship isn't now

02:23:36.976 --> 02:23:43.801
suddenly a giant burning torchlight beacon in the
middle of the fucking harbor.

02:23:43.801 --> 02:23:46.871
LIAM: I don't know if Caleb is a firebug, or if I
am.

02:23:46.871 --> 02:23:48.698
MATT: I know. I respect that.

02:23:48.698 --> 02:23:51.330
MARISHA: I think it's you?

02:23:51.330 --> 02:23:53.414
TRAVIS: Hey man, if you've got Fireball.

02:23:53.414 --> 02:23:56.292
MATT: That ends Caleb's go. Captain's dead.
Caduceus, you're up.

02:23:56.292 --> 02:23:58.440
SAM: All the human cargo is dead.

02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:00.295
LIAM: They're still standing.

02:24:00.295 --> 02:24:03.479
SAM: No, the slaves that were below deck.

02:24:03.479 --> 02:24:05.597
LIAM: The guy came out and said, "Burn all the
slaves"?

02:24:05.597 --> 02:24:07.332
LAURA: No, they said, "Burn it all."

02:24:07.332 --> 02:24:15.489
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to throw a Healing Word
at Beau, and I'm going to start getting out of

02:24:15.489 --> 02:24:21.926
here. I want to cast Healing Word. It's not a lot.
No, it's 60 feet.

02:24:21.926 --> 02:24:23.990
MATT: Yeah, you're within range.

02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:26.965
TALIESIN: That's nice; it's eight points.

02:24:26.965 --> 02:24:29.768
MATT: There you go, eight points to Beau.

02:24:29.768 --> 02:24:37.369
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to start booking out of
here.

02:24:37.369 --> 02:24:38.990
MATT: Where're you going?

02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:45.177
TALIESIN: I'm heading back around the way I assume
everyone else is going. Yeah, that way.

02:24:45.177 --> 02:24:49.113
MATT: Okay. There's Caduceus. Finishing your go.
Yasha's up.

02:24:49.113 --> 02:24:55.009
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to rush up and aid Beau in
trying to pull Marius towards the docks.

02:24:55.009 --> 02:25:01.006
MATT: Okay. If she wants to, she can attempt to
grapple and then pull him out of Beau's grip, or

02:25:01.006 --> 02:25:06.202
we can say she holds her action and then-- it gets
a little weird, because it's-- movement is what

02:25:06.202 --> 02:25:07.482
you pull him out of the way.

02:25:07.482 --> 02:25:10.713
TRAVIS: Would it help make full speed when it
comes back to Beau's turn if she's assisting? Can

02:25:10.713 --> 02:25:11.460
they double pull?

02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:15.237
MARISHA: Can she go, and then I assist on my
turn?

02:25:15.237 --> 02:25:16.774
MATT: I'll allow it.

02:25:16.774 --> 02:25:20.841
TRAVIS: Yeah. I guess do you want me to roll to
grapple?

02:25:20.841 --> 02:25:25.548
MATT: Yes, because he is resisting amongst her
grapple as well, and it's harder to do that.

02:25:25.548 --> 02:25:27.034
TRAVIS: 15 plus her natural strength.

02:25:27.034 --> 02:25:34.123
MATT: Yeah. All right, now it's Marius's turn.
He's going to attempt to break free, now that he's

02:25:34.123 --> 02:25:40.073
full of mind and he's freaking out. "What's he--
what's going--?" Make an acrobatics check against

02:25:40.073 --> 02:25:47.718
your athletics. Technically, since you're both
grappling, either you or Yasha can make the check,

02:25:47.718 --> 02:25:50.877
and it's with advantage, I'll say, because you're
both holding.

02:25:50.877 --> 02:25:54.500
TRAVIS: God, it's an athletics check? What's her
athletics?

02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:58.856
MATT: Strength is plus three and it would be at
plus six, probably.

02:25:58.856 --> 02:26:01.108
MARISHA: I'll do mine, since mine's also a plus
six.

02:26:01.108 --> 02:26:02.235
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:26:02.235 --> 02:26:04.903
TRAVIS and LIAM: Get it, girl.

02:26:04.903 --> 02:26:06.737
MATT: Oh, he almost rolled really high.

02:26:06.737 --> 02:26:09.164
LIAM: Oh! Those are two bad dice rolls.

02:26:09.164 --> 02:26:10.310
MARISHA: 11 total.

02:26:10.310 --> 02:26:13.729
MATT: He does still manage to break free! Yay!

02:26:13.729 --> 02:26:15.671
SAM: Something's going well for Matt.

02:26:15.671 --> 02:26:19.090
MATT: He's going to run.

02:26:19.090 --> 02:26:23.799
MARISHA: Motherfucking piece of shit. Why would
you do that?

02:26:23.799 --> 02:26:26.545
LAURA: Seriously? They had a dagger to your
throat, you dick.

02:26:26.545 --> 02:26:27.938
SAM: The ship's on fire.

02:26:27.938 --> 02:26:33.011
MATT: The ship's not on fire, but he has no reason
to trust any of you and was meeting with these

02:26:33.011 --> 02:26:39.254
people. If he's going to choose between the two,
he's going to step into the ship there. He's like,

02:26:39.254 --> 02:26:46.250
(panting), gets down low, and is hiding. But you
know right where he is. That brings us to the top

02:26:46.250 --> 02:26:48.244
of the round. Fjord, your turn.

02:26:48.244 --> 02:26:50.321
SAM: No problem, we got this.

02:26:50.321 --> 02:26:53.789
LIAM: Fjord pulls out the big guns. Master plan,
here it is.

02:26:53.789 --> 02:26:55.862
TRAVIS: Yep. I'm going to run over here.

02:26:55.862 --> 02:26:59.050
MARISHA: We worked so hard to get him that far.

02:26:59.050 --> 02:27:06.916
TRAVIS: (counting) I'm going to stand out here and
I'll unleash two Eldritch Blasts at this Enforcer.

02:27:06.919 --> 02:27:11.805
MATT: At that guy? You can look and see now: he is
not the Enforcer that went below deck previously.

02:27:11.805 --> 02:27:16.177
He's dressed similarly, but now that you get a
better look at this view in the light, he's

02:27:16.177 --> 02:27:18.423
somebody else. There is still one person down in
the ship.

02:27:18.423 --> 02:27:22.398
TRAVIS: (quietly) Awesome, great, good stuff.
(louder) That's a 20.

02:27:22.398 --> 02:27:24.239
MATT: That hits.

02:27:24.239 --> 02:27:25.542
TRAVIS: 11.

02:27:25.542 --> 02:27:26.992
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:27:26.992 --> 02:27:28.041
TRAVIS: Oh, nice, okay.

02:27:28.041 --> 02:27:31.025
MATT: Yeah, he has leather armor. His AC is 11;
he's pretty easy to hit.

02:27:31.025 --> 02:27:37.270
TRAVIS: 11 points of damage on the first one and
ten points of damage on the second, so 22 total.

02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:44.849
MATT: Ooh, that'll do it. Both blasts take him
down. The attrition is not working well in his favor.

02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:49.020
LAURA: (inaudible)

02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:50.689
SAM: Why don't we say that?

02:27:50.689 --> 02:27:53.339
LAURA: (whispering) Because I'm not up there, and
no one else is remembering.

02:27:53.339 --> 02:27:55.540
TRAVIS: What, that "we come bearing gifts"?

02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:58.000
LAURA: "The Captain" is what we're supposed to
say.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.678
MARISHA: It feels like we're really in battle
now.

02:28:00.678 --> 02:28:06.274
MATT: Caduceus, you do hear-- a ways away, not
here yet, but you do hear some voices and

02:28:06.274 --> 02:28:12.210
footfalls, armored footfalls. You get the sense
that zhelezo are on their way.

02:28:12.210 --> 02:28:17.857
TALIESIN: Guys, we're going to have problems soon.
We should probably get out of here.

02:28:17.857 --> 02:28:20.158
MATT: He will say on his turn when he gets there.

02:28:20.158 --> 02:28:21.912
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's right, I'm not there yet.

02:28:21.912 --> 02:28:27.053
MATT: The bowmen now, who've been hidden below the
deck and have endured the Fireball, two of them

02:28:27.053 --> 02:28:34.725
are going to, from their positions, stand up, and
they're going to take shots at you. (arrows

02:28:34.725 --> 02:28:42.387
firing) They have advantage on both because they
were hidden from you. That is a 19 to hit?

02:28:42.387 --> 02:28:43.519
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:28:43.519 --> 02:28:47.406
MATT: Second one, that's cocked. Advantage. That
is a 20 to hit.

02:28:47.406 --> 02:28:50.654
TRAVIS: It hits. Punish me for this horrible
fucking crap.

02:28:50.654 --> 02:29:06.965
MATT: They have sneak attack because they were
hidden from you. 29 points of piercing damage,

02:29:06.965 --> 02:29:11.069
from those two hits.

02:29:11.069 --> 02:29:12.108
LAURA: Are you still up?

02:29:12.108 --> 02:29:13.014
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

02:29:13.014 --> 02:29:24.818
MATT: The third goes and unfurls the sail and
pulls the rope, and it begins to unroll. A little

02:29:25.166 --> 02:29:27.654
bit of wind is blowing. It opens up a bit.

02:29:27.654 --> 02:29:30.863
LAURA: Do we see the sail? Does it have any
markings on it?

02:29:30.863 --> 02:29:38.903
MATT: No, it is fairly plain. You get the sense
that they're now looking for a way to get out of

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:44.720
here. Ships aren't the fastest when it comes to
exits, but they're trying. That brings us to Beau

02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:46.664
and Nott.

02:29:46.664 --> 02:29:51.280
TRAVIS: Let them go. What the fuck are we going to
do? Run and jump on the goddamn boat?

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:53.725
MARISHA: I was about to do that, yeah.

02:29:53.725 --> 02:30:02.144
MATT: At the end of their turn, these guys are
going to move back as well, and attempt to hide again.

02:30:02.293 --> 02:30:03.522
LIAM: Fuck yeah.

02:30:03.522 --> 02:30:05.107
TRAVIS: All right, sure, go for it.

02:30:05.107 --> 02:30:08.501
LAURA: What? You don't know how many people are on
that boat! Oh my god.

02:30:08.501 --> 02:30:12.141
MATT: They're not very good at hiding, though.
(laughs) They rolled really bad. All three of

02:30:12.141 --> 02:30:14.911
them. At once. A one, a three, and a four.

02:30:14.911 --> 02:30:16.919
TALIESIN: It's a shame they never roll that way
when they're attacking.

02:30:16.919 --> 02:30:21.454
MATT: That's funny. You see them duck down but
they're all pulling out their arrow and nocking it

02:30:21.454 --> 02:30:26.601
into the bow, and you can see exactly where
they're hidden. What's the plan, Beau and Nott?

02:30:26.601 --> 02:30:27.880
LIAM: Bone it.

02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:29.304
TRAVIS: Do what you were going to do. Do it!

02:30:29.304 --> 02:30:30.600
MARISHA: You go first.

02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:31.356
TRAVIS: Do it!

02:30:31.356 --> 02:30:35.111
MARISHA: Are you going to go for the sail? You
could go for the sail, potentially.

02:30:35.111 --> 02:30:37.038
SAM: Thought about that.

02:30:37.038 --> 02:30:44.949
MARISHA: If you could start it, I could maybe rip
it. I don't know, I'm spitballing here. I don't

02:30:44.949 --> 02:30:46.187
know what to do.

02:30:46.187 --> 02:30:47.889
MATT: Make your choices, guys.

02:30:47.889 --> 02:30:51.061
SAM: We've got two bowmen. Who's the guy in black
over there? The Enforcer who came up?

02:30:51.061 --> 02:30:57.144
MATT: No, the Enforcer's dead. Fjord just blew him
up on the side. There's now only three bowmen on

02:30:57.144 --> 02:31:02.315
the deck, and they're all hurt really badly from
the fireball explosion, and they all think they're

02:31:02.315 --> 02:31:04.292
hidden but they're not.

02:31:04.292 --> 02:31:06.267
TRAVIS: Go ahead and fuck them up, man. Go for
it.

02:31:06.267 --> 02:31:14.967
SAM: I'll-- shit, I want to use my sneak attack. I
will bonus action hide and then, from my hidden

02:31:14.967 --> 02:31:16.601
position, I will shoot.

02:31:16.601 --> 02:31:19.110
MATT: Move around the side? All right. Against
which one?

02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:20.835
SAM: The guy in black over there.

02:31:20.835 --> 02:31:24.852
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack, with advantage
because he does not see you.

02:31:24.852 --> 02:31:28.094
SAM: Oh, nice. That's a 23.

02:31:28.094 --> 02:31:31.740
MATT: Yeah, that hits, so go ahead and roll
damage. With sneak attack.

02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:37.594
SAM: That was a good roll.

02:31:37.594 --> 02:31:39.476
TALIESIN: Oh, that's mean.

02:31:39.476 --> 02:31:41.749
SAM: 23 points of damage.

02:31:41.749 --> 02:31:45.535
MATT: The impact hits him and he falls back and
hits the edge of the ship, and then tumbles over

02:31:45.535 --> 02:31:49.194
and splooshes into the water behind. You hear no
noise.

02:31:49.194 --> 02:31:55.242
SAM: I will use any movement to emerge from my
hidden position and move up a bit, to behind those

02:31:55.416 --> 02:31:57.712
barrels, maybe, so I have a little cover.

02:31:57.712 --> 02:31:59.303
MATT: Okay.

02:31:59.303 --> 02:32:08.280
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to run up and go after
these two bowmen, I guess. Fuck me, what am I doing?

02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:10.424
TRAVIS: We're all going to die.

02:32:10.424 --> 02:32:15.427
MATT: You rush, running across the gangplank. As
soon as you come to the edge you look down, and

02:32:15.427 --> 02:32:19.110
there's one of the guys who's about to turn with
his bow and goes (gasp) and sees you--

02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:20.833
MARISHA: I just roundhouse him to the face.

02:32:20.833 --> 02:32:22.501
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

02:32:22.501 --> 02:32:24.634
MARISHA: Motherfucker! Ten.

02:32:24.634 --> 02:32:32.281
MATT: Ten misses. You go and kick, and the water
on the slick deck makes you slip. You catch

02:32:32.349 --> 02:32:34.271
yourself and don't tumble off the side--

02:32:34.271 --> 02:32:36.508
SAM: You got to wear boat shoes!

02:32:36.508 --> 02:32:40.845
MARISHA: I haven't rolled above a five all night.
Okay!

02:32:41.868 --> 02:32:42.868
LIAM: She's back.

02:32:42.868 --> 02:32:44.646
24. No, 23.

02:32:44.814 --> 02:32:48.657
MATT: That hits. You go for one roundhouse and
slip, using the momentum you spin with a lower

02:32:48.657 --> 02:32:53.276
circle kick, like a sweep kick, which is about
head level with him.

02:32:53.276 --> 02:32:54.830
MARISHA: Eight damage.

02:32:54.830 --> 02:33:00.849
MATT: Eight points of damage? That'll do it. The
bowmen don't have a lot of hit points.

02:33:00.849 --> 02:33:03.033
SAM: They've been burned badly.

02:33:03.033 --> 02:33:07.827
MATT: He (groan) and then falls unconscious onto
the deck of the ship.

02:33:07.827 --> 02:33:10.231
MARISHA: Do I have enough-- can I get the other
guy?

02:33:10.231 --> 02:33:14.271
MATT: You do have enough movement, you have 15
feet more, so you leap down onto his crumpled

02:33:14.271 --> 02:33:19.209
unconscious body, and his other friend is going to
pull back to try and take a shot while he's

02:33:19.209 --> 02:33:21.885
backing up towards the back portion of the ship.

02:33:21.885 --> 02:33:27.207
MARISHA: I go: Melee range, you can't do it! And
then a 19?

02:33:27.207 --> 02:33:29.208
MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:33:29.305 --> 02:33:33.102
MARISHA: Big money. Okay! Nine. Die! Die!

02:33:35.072 --> 02:33:36.072
MATT: And so he--

02:33:36.072 --> 02:33:39.529
You (impact sound), and he falls unconscious
onto the ground.

02:33:41.511 --> 02:33:47.388
MARISHA: I turn to Marius and I say "The Gentleman
sent us? Gentleman? You a Gentleman?"

02:33:48.551 --> 02:33:51.712
MATT: He's like (startled gasping). Make a
persuasion check.

02:33:51.712 --> 02:33:52.556
MARISHA: Really?

02:33:52.556 --> 02:33:53.746
MATT: Yeah!

02:33:53.746 --> 02:33:55.251
TRAVIS: We need to get onto the boat and get out
of here.

02:33:55.251 --> 02:33:58.987
MATT: You just killed or beat unconscious the guys
he was coming to meet.

02:33:58.987 --> 02:34:01.677
LIAM: We just flip this. We're going to jack this
fucking boat and get out of here.

02:34:01.677 --> 02:34:02.780
MARISHA: Seven.

02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:07.203
MATT: Seven? He right now is looking panicked, and
the words aren't coming through. He thinks maybe

02:34:07.203 --> 02:34:13.004
you're calling him a gentleman. He's like
(panicked noises), and he's backing away from you.

02:34:13.469 --> 02:34:16.146
LIAM: Ladies and gentlemen.

02:34:16.146 --> 02:34:18.161
(laughter)

02:34:18.946 --> 02:34:20.814
MATT: All right, that ends Beau and Nott's turn.

02:34:20.814 --> 02:34:23.785
LIAM: Life is disappointing, eh?

02:34:23.785 --> 02:34:29.915
MATT: You do hear what sounds like some movement.
The door is partially open to the cabin below and

02:34:29.915 --> 02:34:34.786
there is light coming from the inside, some sort
of lantern light. You hear things being moved around.

02:34:35.075 --> 02:34:38.327
MARISHA: Can I stand on top of the door? Do I have
enough movement to do that?

02:34:38.327 --> 02:34:42.059
MATT: You have five more feet to get to the door
and look beneath but you don't see anything yet.

02:34:42.059 --> 02:34:44.974
MARISHA: I want to tamp it down, stand my full
weight on top of it.

02:34:44.974 --> 02:34:48.879
MATT: Well, the door is on the side, so you'd have
to put your weight against it, yeah.

02:34:48.879 --> 02:34:50.471
MARISHA: Okay.

02:34:50.471 --> 02:34:55.616
MATT: You're up against the door. That brings us
to Jester.

02:34:55.616 --> 02:34:57.011
LAURA: Are we trying to get back on the boat now?

02:34:57.011 --> 02:34:57.975
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:34:57.975 --> 02:34:58.940
SAM: Maybe?

02:34:58.940 --> 02:34:59.910
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:34:59.910 --> 02:35:04.734
LAURA: Okay, I guess I'm going to-- fucking, like
an asshole, run towards the boat. God, this is so

02:35:04.734 --> 02:35:10.895
dumb. I run towards the boat, but I'm going to--
as far as I can.

02:35:10.895 --> 02:35:12.529
SAM: Where are you?

02:35:12.529 --> 02:35:13.834
LIAM: Way far away.

02:35:13.834 --> 02:35:15.325
SAM: We're going to have to fucking wait ten
minutes--

02:35:15.325 --> 02:35:16.726
LIAM: No you won't. No you won't.

02:35:16.726 --> 02:35:19.341
MATT: You can make an action to dash if you want
to get there and do nothing else.

02:35:19.491 --> 02:35:20.847
LAURA: How hurt are you?

02:35:20.847 --> 02:35:22.105
TRAVIS: I'm fine.

02:35:22.105 --> 02:35:26.215
TALIESIN: You've got me too. I'm still spelled up
to all hell.

02:35:26.215 --> 02:35:29.112
LAURA: Okay, I'll double dash to get to the
fucking boat.

02:35:30.962 --> 02:35:32.855
MARISHA: Jump, Jester, jump!

02:35:33.594 --> 02:35:37.686
MATT: You're making your way across the gangplank
like, "oh god!" You're just about to make it to

02:35:37.686 --> 02:35:41.899
the ship, and that's the end of your bonus dash.
Caduceus, you're up. No, sorry, Caleb!

02:35:41.899 --> 02:35:51.091
LIAM: Okay, I see which way the wind is blowing. I
mutter a few arcane words and I cast the spell

02:35:51.091 --> 02:35:56.717
Expeditious Retreat, which is a transmutation
spell so I will also send a little bit of arcane

02:35:56.717 --> 02:36:00.380
energy to the Transmutation stone to give myself
extra speed as well.

02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:01.752
MATT: You can do that!

02:36:01.752 --> 02:36:07.708
LIAM: I can use my action, my movement, and my
bonus action to move full movement at 40.

02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:09.386
So, Vax is back.

02:36:09.386 --> 02:36:11.310
MATT: Vax is back, baby.

02:36:11.310 --> 02:36:13.285
LIAM: I am now on the boat.

02:36:13.285 --> 02:36:16.486
LAURA: Oh my lord. He can do it again.

02:36:16.529 --> 02:36:21.000
LIAM: Transmutation spell gets my movement up to
40. Right.

02:36:21.178 --> 02:36:22.297
(laughs roguishly)

02:36:22.297 --> 02:36:29.364
Action, movement, plus now Expeditious Retreat
is a bonus action.

02:36:29.566 --> 02:36:31.878
MATT: Correct. You can move 80 feet.

02:36:31.878 --> 02:36:33.943
LIAM: 40 plus 40 plus 40?

02:36:33.943 --> 02:36:38.943
MATT: It's a bonus action to cast the spell. Oh,
and when you cast the spell, and then as a bonus

02:36:38.943 --> 02:36:45.162
action-- oh, wow, so it's a dash action as the
spell when it's cast as well, so yeah. That's 120 feet.

02:36:45.302 --> 02:36:46.432
TALIESIN: Whoa.

02:36:46.432 --> 02:36:51.760
LIAM: A red blur goes (zooming sound) and I am
standing next to Beauregard on the boat.

02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:54.398
SAM: Flash! Aah!

02:36:54.398 --> 02:36:56.759
TALIESIN: He'll save every one of us!

02:36:56.759 --> 02:36:59.460
LAURA: He went so fast he knocked me into the
boat.

02:36:59.460 --> 02:37:04.279
MATT: You do, actually, Jester tumbles forward
into the boat from the sheer force of Caleb

02:37:04.279 --> 02:37:07.119
(zooming sound) flashing into the space.

02:37:07.292 --> 02:37:08.487
LIAM: Are we stealing the boat?

02:37:08.487 --> 02:37:09.985
MARISHA: Oh, we're all here.

02:37:09.985 --> 02:37:14.580
LAURA: Does anyone know how to fucking drive a
boat?

02:37:14.580 --> 02:37:16.322
SAM: No one on the boat does.

02:37:16.322 --> 02:37:18.313
MATT: All right, that finishes Caleb's turn.

02:37:18.313 --> 02:37:20.435
MARISHA: The guy who's definitely not here.

02:37:21.625 --> 02:37:23.735
LAURA: Oh my god, the zhelezo are going to come.

02:37:23.735 --> 02:37:25.504
MATT: From around this corner--

02:37:25.616 --> 02:37:27.643
MARISHA: Oh no! We swear we're not pirates!

02:37:27.643 --> 02:37:29.340
LIAM: Way to build that tension.

02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:36.440
MATT: --begin to appear, and now the zhelezo that
are coming around the corner are coming forward

02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:45.423
with torches. There are more a little further down
the way, and they're shouting out, "What's going

02:37:45.423 --> 02:37:50.917
on? What is--" Looking around, they can see you,
Fjord, they can see Yasha up on the side, and they

02:37:50.917 --> 02:37:53.365
can see people on the ship across the way.

02:37:53.365 --> 02:37:54.266
SAM: Oh, no.

02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:56.759
MATT: But that's their turn. They've acknowledged
you and they're telling you to halt and they're

02:37:56.759 --> 02:38:03.436
asking for your attention. Now it's going to turn
to Caduceus' turn. They do not see you. The sound

02:38:03.436 --> 02:38:05.906
you heard, you couldn't quite make out the
direction it's coming from, but you can now hear

02:38:05.906 --> 02:38:08.209
it coming from around the edge of the street.

02:38:08.209 --> 02:38:17.387
TALIESIN: I'm going to ponder. I'm going to make
the sound of a bunch of people panicking and

02:38:17.387 --> 02:38:19.878
saying, "Hide everything, hide everything."

02:38:20.041 --> 02:38:21.165
MATT: With?

02:38:21.165 --> 02:38:23.050
TALIESIN: With Thaumaturgy.

02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:25.725
MATT: You're stretching the cantrip a bit.

02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:28.702
TALIESIN: No, I thought, "you can create an
instantaneous sound that originates from a point

02:38:28.702 --> 02:38:31.121
of your choice within range."

02:38:31.121 --> 02:38:35.305
MATT: It's a sound, like a bird caw. You can't
create the sound of a whole crowd screaming.

02:38:35.305 --> 02:38:36.882
TALIESIN: That's fair, that's fair.

02:38:36.882 --> 02:38:41.849
LAURA: You can do ominous whispers. It's listed.

02:38:41.849 --> 02:38:49.701
TALIESIN: It is listed. I'm going to make one of
the doors on that boat over there slam shut really loudly.

02:38:50.299 --> 02:38:52.791
MATT: (door slamming sound). It does so.

02:38:52.791 --> 02:38:58.952
TALIESIN: I'm going to run and hide behind the
map. I'm going off the map around there. Yep.

02:38:58.952 --> 02:39:02.172
MARISHA: You're going the other way? Away from
everybody else?

02:39:02.172 --> 02:39:02.899
SAM: Oh no!

02:39:02.899 --> 02:39:04.927
TALIESIN: I'm going to just be going--

02:39:04.927 --> 02:39:06.788
MARISHA: We'll catch you upstream.

02:39:06.929 --> 02:39:09.204
TRAVIS: He's going to go hang with the Ruby.

02:39:09.204 --> 02:39:12.777
LAURA: We can't get the boat out of here fast
enough before they can catch the boat.

02:39:12.777 --> 02:39:15.925
MATT: All right, go ahead and-- actually, no, this
would be on their end.

02:39:15.925 --> 02:39:19.819
TALIESIN: That'll just be 30 feet, and I'm not
running, I'm walking.

02:39:19.819 --> 02:39:24.149
MATT: It does catch their attention, and they look
over, and the few that hadn't seen Fjord now look

02:39:24.149 --> 02:39:31.655
over and see Fjord on the dock as well. There you
go. They are aware of those that are currently

02:39:31.655 --> 02:39:35.487
visible on the deck of the ship, and Fjord, and
Yasha over there.

02:39:35.487 --> 02:39:36.892
MARISHA: Great.

02:39:36.892 --> 02:39:39.093
MATT: That ends it-- Yasha's turn? What's Yasha
going to do?

02:39:39.093 --> 02:39:42.951
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to run her ass onto the
boat. Double dash, if she needs to.

02:39:42.951 --> 02:39:45.732
MATT: She doesn't need to. With her speed she gets
onto the ship there.

02:39:45.732 --> 02:39:51.459
TRAVIS: Right, and she will assume the Dodge
whatever in case they throw fire or something at her.

02:39:51.459 --> 02:39:57.227
MATT: Okay. That brings us to the top of the
round. Fjord, your go.

02:39:57.227 --> 02:40:01.056
TRAVIS: I'm going to Arnold Schwarzernegger from
True Lies run and jump off the dock and dive into

02:40:01.056 --> 02:40:05.584
the water, heading straight towards the boat in a
straight line because my speed is the same on land

02:40:05.584 --> 02:40:09.327
or in the water and I will double dash to the
boat.

02:40:10.507 --> 02:40:12.158
LIAM: Into the abyss.

02:40:12.158 --> 02:40:13.218
LAURA: Bloop!

02:40:14.129 --> 02:40:16.069
LIAM: Oh man, all in one movement? That's--

02:40:16.069 --> 02:40:17.320
MARISHA: That's rad.

02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:20.273
TRAVIS: I'll be like, "We're getting the fuck out
of here. Shove off!"

02:40:21.651 --> 02:40:27.748
MATT: As you do that, the guards are going, "Hey!
Hey! Halt!" and they're drawing and loading

02:40:27.896 --> 02:40:31.285
crossbows. You are not stopping, you are not
hailing, you are not listening to anything they're

02:40:31.285 --> 02:40:34.482
saying. They assume you are stealing a ship. Which
you are.

02:40:34.482 --> 02:40:35.715
SAM: Which we are.

02:40:35.715 --> 02:40:37.914
(laughter)

02:40:37.914 --> 02:40:40.556
TALIESIN: Am I going to be the only survivor in
this? This'll be funny.

02:40:40.556 --> 02:40:42.259
MATT: The sails are unfurled.

02:40:42.259 --> 02:40:43.189
SAM: Sail!

02:40:43.189 --> 02:40:47.853
MATT: It's still anchored,
you notice as you get to the dock.

02:40:48.030 --> 02:40:49.869
TRAVIS: Are we tied up, too?

02:40:49.869 --> 02:40:53.482
MATT: Yeah. They were just starting to get the
process going of getting the ship done, and there

02:40:53.482 --> 02:40:57.036
is still somebody down inside rummaging through
the interior.

02:40:57.036 --> 02:40:59.637
SAM: We're off! (unsuccessful noise)

02:41:00.095 --> 02:41:03.714
MATT: Yeah. You as a sailor, you get there and
asses the situation and you're like, "This is

02:41:03.714 --> 02:41:06.544
going to take a little bit to get the boat out of
here."

02:41:06.544 --> 02:41:07.989
SAM: No problem.

02:41:07.989 --> 02:41:11.485
MATT: I mean, through natural means. I don't know
what you have at your disposal, but--

02:41:11.485 --> 02:41:13.886
TRAVIS: I set the boat on fire and kill us all.

02:41:13.886 --> 02:41:15.982
(laughter)

02:41:16.085 --> 02:41:17.404
TRAVIS: Bury our shame.

02:41:17.404 --> 02:41:20.765
MATT: All right, so you've taken your dodge
action. All the bowmen are gone. That brings us to

02:41:20.765 --> 02:41:22.412
Beau and Nott.

02:41:22.412 --> 02:41:31.218
MARISHA: I run over and I untie the boat from the
thing. I undo the rope. Are we hitched to the dock

02:41:31.218 --> 02:41:33.488
with rope? And anchor?

02:41:33.488 --> 02:41:35.640
MATT: Yeah, you're tied onto the side, and then
there's an anchor off the side.

02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:40.361
MARISHA: With a cleat, or whatever they're called?
I work on that because I'm assuming the anchor is heavy.

02:41:40.539 --> 02:41:45.197
MATT: You managed to pull it up. Make a Strength
check to see if you can get it all the way up.

02:41:45.197 --> 02:41:48.286
MARISHA: The anchor? Okay, that's opposite from
what I said.

02:41:48.286 --> 02:41:50.044
MATT: Oh, sorry, I misunderstood. You go ahead--

02:41:50.044 --> 02:41:53.695
MARISHA: I'm trying to undo-- do I also have time
to get the anchor up?

02:41:53.695 --> 02:41:57.226
MATT: Not both. It's an action to untie and get it
off the dock.

02:41:57.226 --> 02:42:01.874
MARISHA: I will focus on untying and getting it
off, and then I do the thing that you do where you

02:42:01.874 --> 02:42:06.366
push on the side of the dock, and I try and get us
like (grunt of effort).

02:42:06.366 --> 02:42:10.869
MATT: Okay, so you shove off a bit. There's still
a good distance. The gangplank is there, so it's

02:42:10.869 --> 02:42:16.410
not right up against the dock per se. There's not
much you can push off of but you do manage to get

02:42:16.410 --> 02:42:17.678
it untied.

02:42:17.678 --> 02:42:20.227
MARISHA: I get it untied. The boat's untied.

02:42:20.227 --> 02:42:21.679
MATT: All right. Nott?

02:42:21.892 --> 02:42:23.838
LAURA: This is the stupidest thing.

02:42:23.999 --> 02:42:26.203
MATT: This is great. This is D&amp;amp;D,
motherfuckers.

02:42:26.502 --> 02:42:27.965
LAURA: The dumbest--

02:42:27.965 --> 02:42:31.886
SAM: So we can't launch. We've got five or six
guards coming at us.

02:42:32.568 --> 02:42:35.732
LIAM: Vox Machina is dead, long live Vox Machina.

02:42:35.732 --> 02:42:38.685
MARISHA: Yeah, they thought Vox Machina were
assholes.

02:42:38.685 --> 02:42:41.055
LIAM: Yeah, oh man.

02:42:41.055 --> 02:42:44.254
MATT: Well, there were a few times that Vox
Machina was in this territory.

02:42:44.254 --> 02:42:46.714
LIAM: Sure, but this is our MO.

02:42:47.444 --> 02:42:51.218
SAM: Wow. I mean, I've got to get on that boat,
right?

02:42:52.650 --> 02:42:54.599
LAURA: Save yourself! Run away!

02:42:54.599 --> 02:42:57.754
SAM: Are there any more moorings or-- did she get
off--

02:42:58.211 --> 02:43:01.038
MATT: She managed to untie it from the dock
itself.

02:43:01.038 --> 02:43:04.221
SAM: But the gangplank is holding us on?

02:43:04.221 --> 02:43:05.721
MATT: No, the gangplank is still resting--

02:43:05.721 --> 02:43:08.419
SAM: It's just resting there, so if we get moving,
it'll just fall.

02:43:08.419 --> 02:43:09.673
MATT: Probably.

02:43:09.673 --> 02:43:20.791
SAM: Okay. I'll dash across the gangplank to get
on the boat and-- jesus, how do we get rid of

02:43:20.791 --> 02:43:22.112
these guys?

02:43:22.112 --> 02:43:24.393
(laughter)

02:43:26.103 --> 02:43:33.213
SAM: I will-- how far away am I? Ten, 20, 30. I
don't know, I'll cast Silent Image.

02:43:33.465 --> 02:43:35.108
MATT: Okay.

02:43:35.108 --> 02:43:50.007
I'll make an image of that captain guy at the end
of the dock, or something, trying to hail them down.

02:43:50.007 --> 02:43:53.587
Not saying anything. Just doing this.

02:43:53.587 --> 02:43:57.999
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Nott. We'll
say it appears--

02:43:57.999 --> 02:43:59.649
SAM: Bonus action hide!

02:43:59.649 --> 02:44:01.591
MATT: There you go. Right there at the edge of the
dock.

02:44:01.591 --> 02:44:02.759
SAM: Great.

02:44:02.759 --> 02:44:04.887
MATT: All right. That brings us to Jester.

02:44:04.887 --> 02:44:06.779
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to--

02:44:06.779 --> 02:44:11.702
MATT: You see the guards. They're arming
crossbows. They're running towards the dock. One

02:44:11.844 --> 02:44:17.562
of them has his hands up, hailing, "Hey, hey!" and
is trying to get your attention. What are you doing?

02:44:17.562 --> 02:44:23.471
LAURA: I'm going to crouch down, and I'm going to
cast Invoke Duplicity.

02:44:23.687 --> 02:44:29.166
MATT: Okay. Where do you want it?

02:44:29.166 --> 02:44:38.253
LAURA: Next to me, where I crouched down from. I'm
going to have her pop up and run across the gangplank.

02:44:38.983 --> 02:44:39.983
MATT: Okay.

02:44:42.913 --> 02:44:50.451
Very obviously run over and look like
she's running over here and hiding.

02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:51.716
MATT: Okay.

02:44:53.361 --> 02:44:58.886
I'm going to stay as hidden as I can
on the boat, crouched down so nobody can see me.

02:44:58.886 --> 02:45:00.327
MATT: Good to know.

02:45:00.327 --> 02:45:02.450
LIAM: Hey Matt, that white ring is just leftovers,
right?

02:45:02.450 --> 02:45:04.254
MATT: No, that's the illusion.

02:45:04.254 --> 02:45:08.681
SAM: That's the illusory captain that I just made
appear at the end of the dock.

02:45:08.681 --> 02:45:10.110
MATT: All right.

02:45:10.110 --> 02:45:19.539
LIAM: My turn? I give the Glove of Blasting a good
tug and I send three arcs of fire up into the air,

02:45:19.539 --> 02:45:25.239
and they spiral around each other and crash down
onto the dock about five to ten feet behind that

02:45:25.239 --> 02:45:29.840
illusion, and blast into the dock.

02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:31.603
LAURA: (whispers) That's good.

02:45:31.728 --> 02:45:38.327
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack for the AC
of wood, which isn't terribly high.

02:45:38.327 --> 02:45:40.160
MARISHA: The AC of wood!

02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:41.696
MATT: It is. It has an AC.

02:45:41.696 --> 02:45:44.131
LIAM: That's a 24.

02:45:44.131 --> 02:45:45.191
MATT: That hits.

02:45:45.191 --> 02:45:49.426
LIAM: Okay. (gasps) Second's a natural one!

02:45:49.426 --> 02:45:52.127
MATT: Hits the water. (sploosh)

02:45:52.127 --> 02:45:54.981
LIAM: Other one is way high, natural 17.

02:45:54.981 --> 02:45:56.846
MATT: Okay. So two hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:45:59.036 --> 02:46:00.207
LIAM: Low rolls.

02:46:03.511 --> 02:46:05.183
12 damage.

02:46:05.183 --> 02:46:11.115
MATT: 12 damage. All right. (explosions) The dock
splinters and bits of it char and burn and go

02:46:11.115 --> 02:46:16.400
flying. It (cracks) but it's still standing. It
wasn't enough to destroy the entire dock. It's

02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:17.264
damaged.

02:46:17.264 --> 02:46:20.197
LIAM: Okay, I will use my movement to (zip) inside
the boat.

02:46:20.197 --> 02:46:25.003
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) You vanish inside the
interior of the cabin, pushing past Beau, who's

02:46:25.003 --> 02:46:26.795
been holding the door shut.

02:46:26.795 --> 02:46:28.564
SAM: Wow, what do you see down there?

02:46:28.564 --> 02:46:31.857
MATT: As soon as you come down inside, there's a
lantern, and there's one of the Enforcers, who you

02:46:31.857 --> 02:46:33.718
can see is burning papers.

02:46:33.718 --> 02:46:35.996
(gasps)

02:46:35.996 --> 02:46:38.541
MATT: He turns around and sees you.

02:46:38.541 --> 02:46:40.958
LIAM: Can I use a cantrip?

02:46:40.958 --> 02:46:42.486
MATT: You have a bonus action cantrip?

02:46:42.486 --> 02:46:47.187
LIAM: Oh no I don't, never mind. Never mind.
Getting the hang of it. Good good good. Done.

02:46:47.187 --> 02:46:54.343
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn. That
comes to the guards. The guards, the one who was

02:46:54.343 --> 02:47:01.906
putting his hands up and was shouting, "Hey!" to
hail you, and was asking what's going on, has no

02:47:01.906 --> 02:47:06.537
choice but to assume that you're destroying the
dock and stealing a ship now. Because you are.

02:47:06.537 --> 02:47:11.408
He's going instead to pull out his heavy crossbow,
and load it. They're going to move up to the side here.

02:47:14.149 --> 02:47:17.303
SAM: Remember how, Jester, you couldn't come back
to this town?

02:47:17.303 --> 02:47:18.649
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:47:18.649 --> 02:47:23.531
(laughter)

02:47:23.531 --> 02:47:31.871
SAM: Well now we all can't. You're never going
to see your mom again. Sorry.

02:47:34.611 --> 02:47:40.148
MATT: The weird butterfly effect of D&amp;amp;D actions.

02:47:40.148 --> 02:47:42.744
TRAVIS: This was just fucked from the first.

02:47:42.744 --> 02:47:45.310
SAM: We were just going to have a conversation
with them.

02:47:45.310 --> 02:47:49.473
MATT: All right, so the guards are going to go
ahead and they're all going to fire.

02:47:49.473 --> 02:47:52.668
LAURA: I'm crouched down.

02:47:52.668 --> 02:47:54.189
SAM: I'm hiding as well.

02:47:54.189 --> 02:48:00.859
MATT: It's going to be two against you, Fjord, two
against Yasha, and one against Marius.

02:48:00.859 --> 02:48:05.049
SAM: (whispers) Oh no. What if Marius dies?

02:48:05.049 --> 02:48:07.941
MATT: Against Fjord, that is a 15 and a 17.

02:48:07.941 --> 02:48:09.773
TRAVIS: 17 will hit, 15 misses.

02:48:09.773 --> 02:48:13.715
MATT: All righty. You take six points of piercing
damage.

02:48:13.715 --> 02:48:16.614
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:48:16.614 --> 02:48:24.314
MATT: Both against Jester... terrible rolls. That
is a 12 and ten. They both just (whiff) past. Oh

02:48:24.314 --> 02:48:26.126
no, those were against Yasha.

02:48:26.126 --> 02:48:27.907
LAURA: Yeah, because I'm crouched.

02:48:27.907 --> 02:48:31.677
MATT: They could have seen you but Yasha was the
bigger threat, but it still misses Yasha. Last one

02:48:31.677 --> 02:48:39.092
against Marius misses, surprisingly, with a
natural seven. He's just (yelps) and he's looking

02:48:39.092 --> 02:48:46.588
at all this happening. He looks freaked out.
That's going to end the guards' turn. Caduceus. As

02:48:46.588 --> 02:48:47.406
you are--

02:48:47.406 --> 02:48:55.208
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Disguise Self. I'm
going to look like a-- I seem to recall-- I'm

02:48:55.541 --> 02:49:00.552
going to make a composite of the most pirate-y--
I've decided everyone who's on a boat is a pirate,

02:49:00.552 --> 02:49:07.724
so I'm going to make the most pirate-y, drunken
old man I possibly can. I'm going to give myself a

02:49:07.724 --> 02:49:18.032
big, white beard, crazy hair, very unthreatening,
buggy eyes. I'm going to continue to circle around the--

02:49:18.032 --> 02:49:22.060
MATT: 30. That gets you just--

02:49:22.060 --> 02:49:24.408
SAM: And that was the last time we ever saw
Caduceus.

02:49:24.408 --> 02:49:25.913
(laughter)

02:49:25.913 --> 02:49:28.197
LIAM: Fuck those idiots.

02:49:28.197 --> 02:49:34.596
TALIESIN: I'm figuring I'm going to have to find
you guys at some point, but yeah, this is... It's

02:49:34.596 --> 02:49:36.668
the only way I know how to get to the water,
so...

02:49:36.668 --> 02:49:39.215
LIAM: (as Caduceus) That was interesting. That was
really great.

02:49:39.215 --> 02:49:42.051
MATT: Finds his own adventure!

02:49:42.051 --> 02:49:44.579
(laughter)

02:49:44.579 --> 02:49:46.103
TALIESIN: I don't have a better way around--

02:49:46.103 --> 02:49:46.837
MATT: No, that's it--

02:49:46.837 --> 02:49:50.584
TALIESIN: Unless there's a window. Unless there's
an open passage on the back of one of those houses.

02:49:50.584 --> 02:49:54.829
MATT: There is. It's a closed window, but you
could try and break it.

02:49:54.829 --> 02:49:56.130
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's too--

02:49:56.130 --> 02:49:58.641
MATT: Okay, so you're over on that side. That's
the end of your turn.

02:49:58.861 --> 02:50:00.713
MARISHA: Just add B&amp;amp;E to the list.

02:50:00.713 --> 02:50:03.477
MATT: Why not? Just go all in! Yasha...

02:50:03.477 --> 02:50:05.714
TALIESIN: That's the best I got right now.

02:50:05.714 --> 02:50:08.005
TRAVIS: We want to pull up the anchor or are we
moving yet?

02:50:08.005 --> 02:50:12.875
MARISHA: I only unfurled, so if Yasha can yank up
that anchor, that'd be dope.

02:50:12.875 --> 02:50:17.901
MATT: All right, so Yasha goes over to the side,
pulls it up (grunts). Gets it on the inside.

02:50:17.901 --> 02:50:20.825
MARISHA: Now we're ready to go.

02:50:20.825 --> 02:50:23.446
MATT: You're now currently not tethered to--

02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:27.417
TRAVIS: With her movement, she'll stand in front
of Marius like a human shield. From any arrows

02:50:27.417 --> 02:50:29.533
that might be coming.

02:50:29.533 --> 02:50:33.775
MATT: Okay. She's trying her best to protect
Marius.

02:50:33.775 --> 02:50:35.667
SAM: Now we've just got to wait for the wind,
guys.

02:50:35.667 --> 02:50:39.421
(laughter)

02:50:39.421 --> 02:50:41.343
LAURA: Where's Keyleth when you need her?

02:50:41.343 --> 02:50:45.653
MATT: I would say, yeah. The time you really miss
the Air Ashari... All right. Now it's Marius's

02:50:45.653 --> 02:50:51.918
turn. What Marius was going to do, he can't do
now. Well, he might try.

02:50:51.918 --> 02:50:54.375
LAURA: He's going to jump in the water.

02:50:54.375 --> 02:50:57.960
MARISHA: Please don't be a dumbass. Marius.

02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:02.133
MATT: No, no. Hold on. Marius moves past Yasha.

02:51:02.133 --> 02:51:06.056
TRAVIS: Do I get an attack of bitch slapping?

02:51:06.056 --> 02:51:15.371
MATT: He gets up to the top of the edge of the
ship. And... let me roll for him to see if--

02:51:15.371 --> 02:51:22.466
that's actually pretty good, okay. He glances
about the scenario, takes in his chances and

02:51:22.466 --> 02:51:28.357
what's happening, and stands up and goes, "Hold!
Hold please! This is a big misunderstanding!

02:51:28.357 --> 02:51:30.683
"Let's talk this out!"

02:51:30.683 --> 02:51:32.326
SAM: To us, or everybody?

02:51:32.326 --> 02:51:39.056
MATT: To the guards. For the sake of this, I'm
going to have one of you guys roll for him. Who

02:51:39.056 --> 02:51:40.506
wants to roll his--

02:51:40.506 --> 02:51:42.067
SAM: I will roll.

02:51:42.067 --> 02:51:44.588
MATT: Persuasion check with disadvantage.

02:51:44.588 --> 02:51:47.129
SAM: Terrible. Both were threes.

02:51:47.129 --> 02:51:49.060
MATT: No.

02:51:49.060 --> 02:51:51.899
LAURA: Why did you roll? Why didn't you roll?!

02:51:51.899 --> 02:51:58.205
MATT: Because it would make it more interesting.
Okay, yeah, that's not having any effect on them.

02:51:58.205 --> 02:52:01.049
They're beyond convincing now, it looks like.

02:52:01.049 --> 02:52:03.765
MARISHA: He just made himself a giant target.
"Wait!"

02:52:03.765 --> 02:52:07.854
MATT: Yeah, he did. But, you know. That finishes
the round. Fjord, you're up.

02:52:07.854 --> 02:52:12.116
TRAVIS: I go up and I kick Marius in the water--
no.

02:52:12.116 --> 02:52:16.356
(laughter)

02:52:16.356 --> 02:52:27.712
TRAVIS: I don't fucking know. Can I double dash
down into the bow of the-- or belowdecks, where

02:52:27.712 --> 02:52:28.961
Caleb is?

02:52:28.961 --> 02:52:29.876
MATT: Sure.

02:52:29.876 --> 02:52:30.693
TRAVIS: I'll do that.

02:52:30.693 --> 02:52:33.916
MATT: Okay, you make your way down, and you join
up at the side of Caleb. You can see now, the

02:52:33.916 --> 02:52:37.402
Enforcer that's there, throwing the paper that's
currently burning onto the table and he's pulling

02:52:37.402 --> 02:52:38.574
a weapon out and he's--

02:52:38.574 --> 02:52:40.323
TRAVIS: Do I have an action or did I double dash
to get down here?

02:52:40.323 --> 02:52:43.622
MATT: You said double dash. It would have taken
that to get there, so. All right.

02:52:43.622 --> 02:52:50.116
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll use my bonus action to cast
Hexblade's Curse on that Enforcer. With the hope

02:52:50.116 --> 02:52:52.010
that he will soon be dead.

02:52:52.010 --> 02:52:57.729
MATT: All right. Now, as he sees you and he's
pulling the blade, you rush into the fray, and

02:52:58.016 --> 02:53:02.678
what heavy shadows still lie in the bottom here,
with the little bit of lantern and fire light

02:53:02.678 --> 02:53:06.463
that's lighting the space, the shadows get darker
around him, and you can see everyone's breath is

02:53:06.463 --> 02:53:12.643
visible suddenly in this under chamber as the
curse takes its hold on him. That goes to Beau and Nott.

02:53:12.643 --> 02:53:19.784
MARISHA: Okay, I go over to the rope of the sail
and I pull it tight-- and the jib-- I don't know.

02:53:19.784 --> 02:53:22.529
I do something, and I go, "Fjord!"

02:53:22.529 --> 02:53:24.430
MATT: Beau has never been on a ship.

02:53:24.430 --> 02:53:26.377
MARISHA: "Fjord, how do I sail?!"

02:53:26.377 --> 02:53:28.426
MATT: The one sailor is below deck right now.

02:53:28.426 --> 02:53:31.107
MARISHA: "Fjord!" I still try--

02:53:31.107 --> 02:53:35.410
TRAVIS: I'm going.

02:53:35.410 --> 02:53:37.405
(laughter)

02:53:37.405 --> 02:53:38.529
TALIESIN: Aw, man.

02:53:38.529 --> 02:53:41.151
MARISHA: I do what I think--

02:53:41.151 --> 02:53:42.614
SAM: Yeah, yeah! Tie that there!

02:53:42.614 --> 02:53:43.793
MARISHA: Tie that? Okay!

02:53:43.793 --> 02:53:45.491
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

02:53:45.491 --> 02:53:47.298
MARISHA: Okay.

02:53:47.298 --> 02:53:48.927
SAM: Do the winch!

02:53:48.927 --> 02:53:54.685
MARISHA: Do the-- what's the jib? Do I jib or do I
winch? Wait, why am I rolling-- which one? Pick

02:53:54.685 --> 02:54:00.923
one! I'm going to do jade, lucky jade, lucky jade.
Okay, okay! That was good! 19 total.

02:54:00.923 --> 02:54:07.008
MATT: Okay, you look at it. You've been watching
boats come into harbor, and you've read things

02:54:07.008 --> 02:54:10.700
about it, but mostly from your observational
skills, which is one of your focuses and

02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:17.595
strengths, Beauregard, you're like, "Okay, I think
I've seen people, you know, making ships go." You

02:54:17.595 --> 02:54:24.530
grab the ropes, you pull, and you yank past, and
you watch as the sail picks up the wind and stiffens.

02:54:24.530 --> 02:54:28.205
MARISHA: (accented) "We've caught the wind!" I've
heard sailors say that.

02:54:28.205 --> 02:54:34.727
MATT: It's like-- Beau, for those purposes, up on
the top, there, holding the rope, and you're like,

02:54:34.727 --> 02:54:37.325
"Ah, okay, there's a sail!"

02:54:37.325 --> 02:54:40.733
MARISHA: There's like a rudder, right? Nott,
rudder, the boat!

02:54:40.733 --> 02:54:42.686
SAM: I hate water!

02:54:42.686 --> 02:54:46.537
(laughter)

02:54:46.537 --> 02:54:48.801
MATT: Nott, what are you doing?

02:54:48.801 --> 02:54:56.255
SAM: Is anything constraining our movement? Is the
gangplank in our way? Or are we unfettered at this point?

02:54:56.432 --> 02:54:59.540
MATT: As far as you know, the gangplank is resting
on there. You don't know if it's connected at all.

02:54:59.540 --> 02:55:01.068
SAM: We're starting to drift a little?

02:55:01.068 --> 02:55:03.926
MATT: You're starting to drift a little bit. The
wind has picked up a little bit.

02:55:03.926 --> 02:55:16.924
SAM: Okay. Then I will run up and tackle Marius to
the ground and wrestle him down. Get over here,

02:55:16.924 --> 02:55:20.460
you fucking-- Get-- Come on! Get down! We're
trying to talk to you!

02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:22.791
MATT: Make an athletics check to grapple.

02:55:22.791 --> 02:55:29.032
SAM: Ooh, wow. Athletics. Oh, that's just a
straight 18.

02:55:29.032 --> 02:55:36.623
MATT: Straight 18. Yeah. Like a wet paper bag, he
goes over, "Ah!" (boof) and they both slam onto

02:55:36.763 --> 02:55:43.694
the deck below. You have him grappled and you're
like holding him down. You're not-- you don't

02:55:43.694 --> 02:55:49.096
weigh a lot, but you're leveraging and pulling the
weight in a way where he can't-- his knees are

02:55:49.096 --> 02:55:54.116
buckled and he can't actually get any ground to
hold himself up, so. You got him.

02:55:54.116 --> 02:55:55.542
SAM: Okay. That's all I got.

02:55:55.542 --> 02:56:00.418
MATT: All right. The Enforcer who's below, who has
the curse, is going to go ahead and swing forward

02:56:00.418 --> 02:56:06.217
two attacks with his blade. This is going to be...
this is going to be against you, Fjord, because

02:56:06.217 --> 02:56:07.640
you're the one that came in and cursed him.

02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:09.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, yeah.

02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:12.834
MATT: That's going to be a 15 to hit.

02:56:12.834 --> 02:56:13.944
TRAVIS: It misses.

02:56:13.944 --> 02:56:17.044
MATT: (impact) Shield off to one side. Natural
19.

02:56:17.044 --> 02:56:18.459
TRAVIS: It hits.

02:56:18.459 --> 02:56:21.733
SAM: This is your, like, favored terrain and
stuff. It's a boat.

02:56:21.733 --> 02:56:22.685
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:56:22.685 --> 02:56:24.704
TALIESIN: This is a disaster.

02:56:24.704 --> 02:56:28.809
MATT: That is ten points of slashing damage.

02:56:28.809 --> 02:56:34.192
TRAVIS: I'm uncon-- No, I'll use my Relentless
En-fucking-[slurred]

02:56:34.192 --> 02:56:35.650
SAM: We're going to lose the sailor.

02:56:35.650 --> 02:56:37.356
(laughter)

02:56:37.356 --> 02:56:39.907
TRAVIS: Well, I'm up to one hit point.

02:56:39.907 --> 02:56:41.114
LAURA: Seriously?

02:56:41.114 --> 02:56:45.200
MATT: You (groan). You just manage to hold on by a
thread. Your consciousness waning, your eyes focus

02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:47.789
angrily towards the target of your Hexblade's
Curse.

02:56:47.789 --> 02:56:51.442
TRAVIS: Just out of pity's sake. I'm disappointed
I came back up to one hit point.

02:56:51.442 --> 02:56:54.050
LAURA: I don't even know that's happening.

02:56:54.050 --> 02:56:55.619
SAM and TALIESIN: No.

02:56:55.619 --> 02:56:58.426
MATT: All right. That brings us to Jester's turn.

02:56:58.426 --> 02:57:04.747
LAURA: Great. I'm going to use my Duplicate to run
forward...

02:57:04.757 --> 02:57:06.887
MARISHA: What are we doing?

02:57:08.027 --> 02:57:11.799
SAM: We're saving the world, Marisha, we're saving
the world.

02:57:11.799 --> 02:57:19.364
LAURA: I'm going to use my Pearl of Power to cast
my last remaining 3rd-level spell, and I'm going

02:57:19.364 --> 02:57:25.822
to cast Charm Person on the three of the guards
that I can see.

02:57:25.822 --> 02:57:28.039
MATT: Okay. Ones up front?

02:57:28.039 --> 02:57:29.514
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

02:57:29.514 --> 02:57:32.488
MATT: The one up here is the leader, the one that
was guiding them on stuff.

02:57:32.488 --> 02:57:34.441
LAURA: Okay, yeah, that's good.

02:57:34.441 --> 02:57:41.681
MATT: He fails with a natural three. Two natural
threes in a row! Fucking lucky. The third one on

02:57:41.681 --> 02:57:49.454
the far end... is a natural six. Okay. So. You are
currently-- oh no, it's not concentration for

02:57:49.454 --> 02:57:53.310
Charm Person. Those three are charmed.

02:57:53.310 --> 02:57:55.212
LAURA: For an hour.

02:57:55.212 --> 02:57:59.711
SAM: We're doing great, guys! We've killed
everybody, we're charming people, we're on a boat.

02:57:59.711 --> 02:58:03.659
MATT: They are technically in combat with you.

02:58:03.659 --> 02:58:07.231
SAM: Is Frumpkin an octopus and is it lying back
on the dock somewhere?

02:58:07.231 --> 02:58:08.690
LIAM: Frumpkin is not there.

02:58:08.690 --> 02:58:10.002
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:58:10.002 --> 02:58:13.679
LAURA: It is charmed by you until the spell ends
or until your companions do anything harmful to

02:58:13.679 --> 02:58:20.113
it. When the spell ends-- It doesn't say anything
about it not being in combat.

02:58:20.113 --> 02:58:23.719
MATT: Makes a wisdom saving throw and does so with
advantage if you or your companions are fighting it.

02:58:23.719 --> 02:58:26.386
LAURA: Oh, okay. It doesn't say that on the
thingy. Sorry.

02:58:26.931 --> 02:58:29.213
TALIESIN: Although they haven't technically
attacked... Oh, no.

02:58:29.213 --> 02:58:33.917
MATT: Yeah, there's been enough aggressive action,
they're considered fighting. They've all failed

02:58:33.917 --> 02:58:39.304
their save. I'm going to do one more roll for all
of them. The leader-- that's cocked. That's a

02:58:39.304 --> 02:58:41.571
natural 12 plus two, 14. What's your DC?

02:58:41.571 --> 02:58:42.685
LAURA: 15!

02:58:42.685 --> 02:58:49.578
MATT: 15. That's a natural ten and a natural 11!
They all fail again. Yeah, they're all still

02:58:49.578 --> 02:58:51.753
charmed. Well done.

02:58:51.753 --> 02:58:53.179
SAM: What are the odds?

02:58:53.179 --> 02:58:58.110
MATT: That's kind of crazy, actually. All right,
so we'll say the red here is Charm Person.

02:59:01.210 --> 02:59:05.766
MARISHA: I can feel Travis's Dad disappointment,
like radiating--

02:59:06.183 --> 02:59:06.865
SAM: In himself?

02:59:06.865 --> 02:59:07.902
TRAVIS: In myself, yeah.

02:59:07.902 --> 02:59:08.633
SAM: And in us?

02:59:08.633 --> 02:59:09.706
MARISHA: It's hot.

02:59:09.706 --> 02:59:14.834
MATT: The three of them drop their weapons for a
second and are looking confused. The ones

02:59:14.834 --> 02:59:17.568
behind are still loading and getting ready.

02:59:17.568 --> 02:59:28.054
LAURA: Okay. I guess I'm going to stay hidden on
my end and try to make my way down. I can't do

02:59:28.054 --> 02:59:35.259
anything below, but okay, whatever, yeah. Yeah, I
guess I'm going to try to go-- No, because I'm

02:59:35.259 --> 02:59:38.553
going to keep visual on Duplicate Jester. I'm
going to stay hidden on the top.

02:59:38.553 --> 02:59:40.973
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn, Jester. Caleb.

02:59:40.973 --> 02:59:46.880
LIAM: Ja I rub a bit of honey across my lip and
say, "Mein Freund, I suggest you throw down your

02:59:46.997 --> 02:59:51.131
weapons and lie under that desk, just for your
safety," and I cast Suggestion.

02:59:51.131 --> 03:00:00.333
MATT: Okay. This is a natural seven, that's a
failure. After slashing into Fjord and turning

03:00:00.333 --> 03:00:05.768
towards you and seeing that fall, he throws his
weapon down and crawls under the table angrily,

03:00:05.768 --> 03:00:13.024
like "Grr, I'm going to get you under this table!"
and then he gets there and looks very confused.

03:00:13.024 --> 03:00:17.635
LIAM: I would like to use movement to zip up to
the top and look around.

03:00:17.635 --> 03:00:24.826
MATT: Let's see here. Yeah, we'll say that's what
his next action would be, since technically it's

03:00:24.826 --> 03:00:26.832
out of turn.

03:00:26.832 --> 03:00:28.852
LIAM: You mean climbing under the desk?

03:00:28.852 --> 03:00:31.286
MATT: Yeah. It's happening simultaneously.

03:00:31.286 --> 03:00:36.550
LIAM: I use my movement to zip up and look around
and my bonus action to zip back down into the boat.

03:00:37.112 --> 03:00:40.156
MATT: You look up and you see this scenario. You
see the guards are still standing there at the

03:00:40.156 --> 03:00:43.765
edge. The ship is moving, it's slowly pulling
away.

03:00:43.765 --> 03:00:45.789
LAURA: Don't hit those guys in the front.

03:00:45.789 --> 03:00:54.244
MATT: That brings us to the guards' turn. The two
in the back are going to go ahead and fire. That's

03:00:54.244 --> 03:01:03.192
going to be one at Beau and one at Yasha. Against
Beau, that is a 17 to hit.

03:01:03.192 --> 03:01:04.692
MARISHA: Miss.

03:01:04.692 --> 03:01:09.620
MATT: Against Yasha, that is a 16 to hit. I
believe that does hit. She doesn't have a huge

03:01:09.620 --> 03:01:15.198
armor class, if I recall. She does take only five
points of piercing damage.

03:01:15.198 --> 03:01:19.494
TRAVIS: Is that already halved because of raging?

03:01:19.494 --> 03:01:22.507
MATT: Well, she hasn't attacked anything.

03:01:22.507 --> 03:01:24.376
TRAVIS: You're right, that would fall. Yeah.

03:01:24.376 --> 03:01:28.218
MATT: Did she take damage last turn? Oh, she was
attacked last turn, so she's still raging.

03:01:28.218 --> 03:01:29.544
TRAVIS: Oh, she did.

03:01:29.544 --> 03:01:31.698
MATT: But there were a few rounds there where she
didn't hit anything, so the rage fell.

03:01:31.698 --> 03:01:36.215
LAURA: The guy that targeted Beau has to make a
wisdom saving throw.

03:01:36.215 --> 03:01:42.109
MATT: Oh, that's true. He fails, so he goes to
fire and he has to choose another target.

03:01:42.109 --> 03:01:44.304
LAURA: No, he just fails if on a fail--

03:01:44.304 --> 03:01:46.523
SAM: No, he can choose another target on
Sanctuary.

03:01:46.523 --> 03:01:56.644
MATT: It's okay. It's a 1st-level spell. Instead,
he's going to fire that at Yasha as well. Okay,

03:01:56.644 --> 03:02:02.411
that is a failure. That is a natural seven. No
damage outside of the damage that she took there.

03:02:02.411 --> 03:02:12.197
At that point, the leader goes, "Wait hold, what
are you doing? Stand back!" and the guy's like,

03:02:12.197 --> 03:02:17.929
"What are you talking about?" "Hold on. We have to
figure this out. Something is strange about this.

03:02:17.929 --> 03:02:23.445
"Hold up!" He starts shouting to hail in your
direction, and the other guards are putting their

03:02:23.445 --> 03:02:29.647
weapons away and are about to walk over. The two
in the back are like, "What?!"

03:02:29.647 --> 03:02:32.165
SAM: Wow.

03:02:32.165 --> 03:02:37.520
MATT: Yeah, they are not sure what's happening.
They are not perceptive enough to have seen that

03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:41.324
it's a spell effect that has changed them. They're
confused by it. We'll see if they figure it out

03:02:41.324 --> 03:02:49.565
soon. With that, these guys are going to begin to
walk and make their way toward the broken docks.

03:02:49.565 --> 03:02:52.002
LIAM: Possibly burning.

03:02:52.002 --> 03:02:56.692
MATT: They see the illusory guy there and look
confused.

03:02:56.692 --> 03:02:58.812
LAURA: It just looks like me, though.

03:02:58.812 --> 03:03:00.145
TALIESIN: No, there's another guy.

03:03:00.145 --> 03:03:07.073
MATT: There's the guy just waving to them. That's
all he's doing repeatedly. He's like one of those

03:03:07.073 --> 03:03:15.074
mannequins holding the electrical signs on the
street. Yeah, he's a wacky waving--

03:03:15.074 --> 03:03:17.207
TALIESIN: A wacky waver.

03:03:17.207 --> 03:03:18.966
MATT: A half-orc.

03:03:18.966 --> 03:03:22.972
LIAM: He's got the cardboard arrow, spinning it.

03:03:22.972 --> 03:03:23.766
TALIESIN: Freestyle.

03:03:23.766 --> 03:03:26.339
MATT: These guards are going to chase up confused
and they're going, "Sir! Sir! Sir!" and they're

03:03:26.339 --> 03:03:31.327
not entirely certain what's going on. They're
really confused by the scenario. That's going to

03:03:31.327 --> 03:03:32.449
go to Caduceus.

03:03:32.449 --> 03:03:36.603
TALIESIN: I'm going to NPC my ass right across the
street.

03:03:36.603 --> 03:03:37.996
MATT: 25, 30.

03:03:37.996 --> 03:03:42.519
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if I can take my action
and keep going quietly. Oh no, I'm not going

03:03:42.519 --> 03:03:46.038
that-- I'm going to go behind those. I'm getting
in the water.

03:03:46.038 --> 03:03:47.305
MATT: Oh, this way?

03:03:47.305 --> 03:03:49.279
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm getting in the water.

03:03:49.279 --> 03:03:50.711
SAM: In the water?

03:03:50.711 --> 03:03:51.287
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:03:51.287 --> 03:03:54.641
MATT: 25, 30.

03:03:54.641 --> 03:03:59.086
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently get in. Yeah, I'm
sitting in.

03:03:59.086 --> 03:04:00.408
MATT: It's a ten-foot drop.

03:04:00.408 --> 03:04:02.185
TALIESIN: Oh is it a ten-foot drop?

03:04:02.185 --> 03:04:02.871
MATT: Yep.

03:04:02.871 --> 03:04:04.746
LAURA: Can you lower yourself? You're pretty
tall.

03:04:04.746 --> 03:04:07.459
TALIESIN; Can I climb down instead of jumping?

03:04:07.459 --> 03:04:09.036
MATT: Sure, make an athletics check.

03:04:09.036 --> 03:04:11.334
TALIESIN: All right.

03:04:11.334 --> 03:04:13.192
LIAM: Is he Kaiju-sized?

03:04:13.192 --> 03:04:18.613
TALIESIN: I am very tiny looking right now. Come
on. Oh my god, that was almost terrible. Nine.

03:04:18.613 --> 03:04:26.088
MATT: Nine? You slip and fall a little bit. You
get down about five feet and you make a splash sound.

03:04:26.098 --> 03:04:28.389
TALIESIN: There's a lot happening.

03:04:28.389 --> 03:04:30.115
TRAVIS: The dock's on fire, for crying out loud.

03:04:30.115 --> 03:04:32.250
MATT: Yeah, they don't notice.

03:04:32.250 --> 03:04:36.910
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly start making my way
underneath everything, quietly and with--

03:04:36.910 --> 03:04:40.342
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20. Yeah, you're slowly
wading through the water.

03:04:40.342 --> 03:04:40.942
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:04:40.942 --> 03:04:43.961
MATT: Okay, that ends you're go. Yasha's turn.

03:04:43.961 --> 03:04:47.111
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to turn and bear hug
Marius.

03:04:47.111 --> 03:04:49.112
SAM: I'm already on him.

03:04:49.112 --> 03:04:53.421
TRAVIS: Awesome. She's going to assume the dodge--
Is there anything else to do?

03:04:53.421 --> 03:04:55.848
LAURA: Can she help try to get the ship to move
more?

03:04:55.848 --> 03:04:58.125
TALIESIN: Does she know boats?

03:04:58.125 --> 03:05:00.518
TRAVIS: Does Yasha know boats?

03:05:00.518 --> 03:05:03.744
MATT: Yasha, as far as you know, does not know
boats. She's never mentioned anything about it,

03:05:03.744 --> 03:05:08.909
and Yasha looks like she doesn't know what she's
doing. She's not giving orders, or rushing to take

03:05:08.909 --> 03:05:10.018
a post.

03:05:10.018 --> 03:05:12.951
TRAVIS: I mean, I suppose she could run over to
the gangplank and she could try to pull it and

03:05:12.951 --> 03:05:15.040
shove it against the dock and push off.

03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:17.857
SAM: The old plank shove.

03:05:17.857 --> 03:05:23.556
MATT: Yasha will go ahead and push on the
gangplank. Make a strength check for Yasha shoving off.

03:05:25.003 --> 03:05:25.761
TRAVIS: 26.

03:05:25.761 --> 03:05:32.294
MATT: She shoves and the whole boat shifts
suddenly. The gangplank plunges down into the

03:05:32.294 --> 03:05:39.108
water and it's floating there on the top. The ship
gets shoved off about ten feet in that direction.

03:05:39.108 --> 03:05:41.048
LIAM: Who could have predicted this?

03:05:41.823 --> 03:05:48.748
[music]

03:05:48.748 --> 03:05:56.429
Marius is just standing there, held by a goblin,
going, "Ah!"

03:05:56.429 --> 03:05:59.045
SAM: Stay down! Stay down!

03:05:59.256 --> 03:06:02.526
MATT: "All right, all right!", and he stays quiet
there, and doesn't do anything. Fjord?

03:06:02.526 --> 03:06:06.220
TRAVIS: I'll back up to the top of the ship, where
I should be useful.

03:06:06.220 --> 03:06:13.016
MATT: 15 feet of movement to get up there.

03:06:13.016 --> 03:06:15.328
TRAVIS: Do I have an action?

03:06:15.328 --> 03:06:18.240
MATT: You have 15 more feet of movement and you
have an action.

03:06:18.240 --> 03:06:20.507
TRAVIS: I'll climb up onto where the rudder is.

03:06:20.507 --> 03:06:23.602
LIAM: "Oh, you want this seafaring knowledge? What
can you give me?"

03:06:23.602 --> 03:06:26.622
MATT: You get up and man it.

03:06:26.622 --> 03:06:29.383
TRAVIS: I start turning the bow of the ship out
towards the sea.

03:06:29.383 --> 03:06:31.963
MATT: It starts arcing and making its way in that
direction, turning slowly.

03:06:31.963 --> 03:06:35.040
TRAVIS: I'm smashing my head into the fucking
bow.

03:06:35.040 --> 03:06:37.739
LAURA: Don't do it, you only have one hit point.

03:06:37.739 --> 03:06:45.616
TRAVIS: I fall unconscious. When I wake up this
will all be over. I do that.

03:06:45.616 --> 03:06:46.685
LAURA: No, you don't.

03:06:46.685 --> 03:06:47.663
TRAVIS: Yes, I do.

03:06:49.103 --> 03:06:50.295
LAURA: Fjord.

03:06:50.295 --> 03:06:53.233
LIAM: That's a bad idea.

03:06:53.233 --> 03:06:55.603
LAURA: Don't do that.

03:06:55.603 --> 03:06:57.081
TRAVIS: I do it.

03:06:57.081 --> 03:07:01.968
MATT: Okay. Fjord, in a fit of frustration and
anger, once the rudder is locked in place and the

03:07:01.968 --> 03:07:08.347
ship begins to turn in position, bashes his head
in very much a "This is so stupid!" movement.

03:07:08.347 --> 03:07:15.932
It doesn't knock you unconscious, but you are
dizzy as fuck. You have you hit your head real

03:07:15.932 --> 03:07:18.340
hard on there to do a point of damage. Do you want
to do that?

03:07:18.340 --> 03:07:20.254
TRAVIS: No, that's fine. Frustration's good
enough.

03:07:20.254 --> 03:07:23.283
MATT: Frustration, you'll hurt yourself, but to
take a point of damage?

03:07:23.283 --> 03:07:24.891
TRAVIS: Frustration's fine.

03:07:24.891 --> 03:07:30.433
MATT: You're like, "Ugh!" There's a little bit of
blood trickling out from where the head got mashed

03:07:30.433 --> 03:07:34.620
a little bit. The partially splintered wood from
the explosion of the Fireball earlier...

03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:37.457
LAURA: Oh god, are we going to sink?

03:07:37.457 --> 03:07:43.008
TALIESIN: Why would you say that out loud?! What's
wrong with you?!

03:07:44.288 --> 03:07:47.171
TRAVIS: No, that's appropriate for today.

03:07:47.171 --> 03:07:59.286
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. Now the ship is
moving on initiative 20. The ship moves out and is

03:07:59.557 --> 03:08:07.329
over there now, and is turning this way. That
brings us to Beau and Nott.

03:08:09.399 --> 03:08:14.276
MARISHA: I see Fjord bash his head against the
wall and I go, you guys, I think Fjord's under

03:08:14.528 --> 03:08:21.590
some sort of influence magic! He's not himself!
Then I yank the--

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:24.168
MATT: You're just using your action to hold onto
the sail and keep it open.

03:08:24.168 --> 03:08:26.279
MARISHA: Tell me what to do!

03:08:26.279 --> 03:08:28.972
TRAVIS: Oh right, you don't know how to sail the
ship.

03:08:28.972 --> 03:08:30.546
MARISHA: You motherfucker!

03:08:30.546 --> 03:08:32.908
MATT: You're the only one, really.

03:08:32.908 --> 03:08:35.785
TRAVIS: Hoist the thing and then the other one.

03:08:35.785 --> 03:08:38.867
MARISHA: I try and interpret what he says. Hoist
the thing!

03:08:38.867 --> 03:08:42.345
MATT: Listening to the thing, you eventually get
her to figure it out. You get the sail situated,

03:08:42.345 --> 03:08:47.172
and that will be your action for the turn. Okay,
Nott?

03:08:47.172 --> 03:08:53.581
SAM: I will spend my action seeing if there's any
rope lying around, and trying to tie the man's

03:08:53.581 --> 03:08:54.977
hands up.

03:08:54.977 --> 03:09:02.105
MATT: There is a couple of coils of rope left
there in the far corner of the-- you'll have to

03:09:02.105 --> 03:09:03.901
release him to go get it.

03:09:03.901 --> 03:09:12.534
SAM: I will keep him and I will Mage Hand grab
some rope and bring it over to me, but then that

03:09:12.534 --> 03:09:14.534
will be my action.

03:09:14.534 --> 03:09:21.608
MATT: Still holding him, because he's keeping
quiet, the rope hovers over and plops next to you.

03:09:22.187 --> 03:09:25.936
SAM: Then bonus action, I will use Mage Hand to
start looping it around him.

03:09:25.936 --> 03:09:31.368
MATT: Okay! Go ahead and make a sleight of hand
check for me. Well, just a general dexterity

03:09:31.368 --> 03:09:35.577
check, actually. You're not proficient in this,
necessarily, so just add your dexterity modifier.

03:09:35.577 --> 03:09:36.711
SAM: Ten.

03:09:36.711 --> 03:09:38.923
MATT: Okay, you've begun the process. It's not an
immediate--

03:09:38.923 --> 03:09:43.833
SAM: Oh, wait. No, it's just a seven. That's bad.

03:09:43.833 --> 03:09:49.291
MATT: You're not a master of rope tying,
necessarily. This round, the ropes are slipping

03:09:49.291 --> 03:09:56.104
and while Marius is fighting against it a little
bit, you're not getting too much of a hold on it.

03:09:56.104 --> 03:10:06.825
All right, that ends your go. The Enforcer below,
who has completed the-- now is when he's ducked

03:10:06.825 --> 03:10:11.730
behind, because he lost his action to do that. He
now gets under the table, throws his weapon down,

03:10:11.730 --> 03:10:21.718
and goes, "What the fuck?" Goes to pick up the
weapon; that's his turn. Jester, you go. It's so ridiculous.

03:10:21.718 --> 03:10:23.968
LIAM: Did he just break it, is that what Caleb
saw?

03:10:23.968 --> 03:10:26.063
MARISHA: He realized he was being dumb.

03:10:26.063 --> 03:10:27.787
SAM: He's just doing it.

03:10:27.787 --> 03:10:29.198
LIAM: He's got to do it.

03:10:29.198 --> 03:10:30.957
MATT: No, but he performed the action.

03:10:30.957 --> 03:10:31.726
LIAM: Right.

03:10:37.306 --> 03:10:39.316
MATT: Yeah, spell ends.

03:10:39.316 --> 03:10:46.043
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my axe, the
duplicate, and I'm going to act like she hits

03:10:46.321 --> 03:10:52.672
herself with it-- so stupid-- and go (dying noise)
and falls into the water.

03:10:52.672 --> 03:10:54.848
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

03:10:54.848 --> 03:10:58.088
SAM: She commits suicide in front of him?

03:10:58.088 --> 03:11:04.240
MATT: The leader goes, "No!", who considers you a
friend at the moment and is seemingly really

03:11:04.240 --> 03:11:06.161
distraught to watch this happen.

03:11:06.161 --> 03:11:08.679
SAM: What is happening?

03:11:08.679 --> 03:11:11.549
LAURA: She's going to be floating in the water,
and then I'm going to go--

03:11:11.549 --> 03:11:13.845
MATT: I take it you're not concentrating on your
Silent Image anymore?

03:11:13.845 --> 03:11:22.455
SAM: I'm probably focusing on Marius? So no. I'm
not.

03:11:22.455 --> 03:11:31.041
MATT: Okay. That vanishes right as she kills
herself and falls into the water. Very confused.

03:11:31.041 --> 03:11:41.636
LAURA: Then I'm going to, for my action as Jester,
go and try to hold the door shut for the under--

03:11:41.636 --> 03:11:46.987
MATT: Okay. You move up to the door and-- holding
it there.

03:11:46.987 --> 03:11:50.069
LAURA: But I'm crawling, I don't want them to see
me.

03:11:50.069 --> 03:11:52.582
MATT: You're keeping low, yeah. It's half
movement, you still get there, and you're prone.

03:11:52.582 --> 03:11:54.216
All right, Caleb.

03:11:54.216 --> 03:11:57.703
LIAM: I just want to clarify. I thought that I had
told him to throw down his weapons and hide under

03:11:57.703 --> 03:12:00.348
the desk for his safety. That's not an ongoing
thing?

03:12:00.348 --> 03:12:01.607
MARISHA: He did that.

03:12:01.607 --> 03:12:04.243
LIAM: But you don't go down and then immediately
stand up and get out again, do you?

03:12:04.243 --> 03:12:05.803
MARISHA: He saved from the spell.

03:12:05.803 --> 03:12:07.719
LIAM: Oh, he saved from the spell?

03:12:07.719 --> 03:12:12.987
MATT: No. How it works is, you give them a task.
He went and hid under the table for safety, which

03:12:12.987 --> 03:12:14.029
he did.

03:12:14.029 --> 03:12:17.014
LIAM: Hiding under the table for six seconds is a
shitty job at hiding, but okay.

03:12:17.014 --> 03:12:20.552
MATT: But it wasn't specific enough. It wasn't a
very specific suggestion.

03:12:20.552 --> 03:12:36.144
LIAM: Okay, that's fine. I have to totally rethink
everything, so give me ten seconds. I will use my

03:12:36.144 --> 03:12:41.647
action to run forward and, with the edges of my
coat, put out the burning papers.

03:12:41.647 --> 03:12:46.447
LAURA: Are you downstairs? I thought you were
upstairs.

03:12:46.447 --> 03:12:53.393
MATT: No, you locked him down there. "You're in
here with me!" All right, you put out the fire.

03:12:53.393 --> 03:13:01.632
You can see now, it looks like what was a map that
is mostly burned entirely.

03:13:01.632 --> 03:13:06.847
LIAM: Do I see anything? As I'm doing this, yeah,
if I'm looking at it.

03:13:06.847 --> 03:13:11.453
MATT: On the map? Yeah, you see part of the Coast,
and you see some notes, and you see something on

03:13:11.453 --> 03:13:16.110
there. Clearly looking at it, there is information
on it, but you're putting it out, (blowing).

03:13:16.110 --> 03:13:22.838
LIAM: Okay, that's it, I'm done. I would say that
probably what I would've done, not knowing any of

03:13:22.838 --> 03:13:28.500
that, is zip up to go up and then see if the door
is shut and go-- and that's the end of my turn.

03:13:28.500 --> 03:13:34.688
MATT: That's going to be your turn. That brings us
to the guards' turn. The guards in the back are

03:13:34.688 --> 03:13:42.106
shaking the other guard, "What are you doing?
They're getting away!" He's like, "Look. This is a

03:13:42.106 --> 03:13:46.742
"very confusing scenario, and we're trying to
ascertain what's happening. They seem safe for

03:13:46.742 --> 03:13:49.254
"now, but why did this dock explode?"

03:13:49.254 --> 03:13:51.740
LAURA: Also, there's a girl floating in the
water.

03:13:51.740 --> 03:14:02.555
MATT: "She just killed herself, go check on her,
make sure she's okay!" The guard's like-- Natural

03:14:02.555 --> 03:14:09.012
20. They're like, "This is foul magic." He starts
slapping him in the face and he's like, "Get

03:14:09.012 --> 03:14:12.667
away," and he's like, "Call a mage, we have to get
this taken care of."

03:14:12.667 --> 03:14:16.682
TRAVIS: Ooh, the mage. A mage, or the mage?

03:14:16.682 --> 03:14:18.620
LAURA and LIAM: A mage.

03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:23.434
MATT: They start shouting for help. Frumpkin's
still hanging out over here. I figured you

03:14:23.434 --> 03:14:24.417
would've blinked Frumpkin.

03:14:24.417 --> 03:14:26.905
LIAM: Yeah, I was casting Find Familiar.

03:14:26.905 --> 03:14:32.772
MATT: You still have an octopus Frumpkin with you.
The guards are now--

03:14:32.772 --> 03:14:34.922
MARISHA: Yeah, it interrupted that with the
fight.

03:14:34.922 --> 03:14:40.264
MATT: Yeah. They're momentarily distracted by all
the things that have happened, the ship getting

03:14:40.264 --> 03:14:46.424
away and their leader's essentially acting really
dumb, and now ascertaining that it's magical, they

03:14:46.424 --> 03:14:52.038
don't know what to do, so they're starting to
shout out, and one of them's starting to leave and

03:14:52.038 --> 03:14:57.365
go to get help. They start darting this way,
shouting. These guys all begin to inspect and try

03:14:57.365 --> 03:15:01.294
to see if they can find the poor woman. This guy
dives into the water to try and see if he can save her.

03:15:01.305 --> 03:15:03.983
(laughter)

03:15:03.983 --> 03:15:07.471
MATT: He's now swimming in the water going, "Where
are you? No! You have so much to live for!"

03:15:07.471 --> 03:15:11.544
(laughter)

03:15:11.544 --> 03:15:13.445
MATT: That's their action. Caduceus?

03:15:13.445 --> 03:15:17.443
TALIESIN: I'm swimming full speed directly out
into the ocean.

03:15:17.443 --> 03:15:25.075
MATT: 30. That's as much as you can get. It's half
movement in the water.

03:15:25.075 --> 03:15:28.370
(laughter)

03:15:28.370 --> 03:15:30.392
SAM: He's never seen the ocean before.

03:15:30.392 --> 03:15:31.480
(laughter)

03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:33.397
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, no, I'm not having a good--

03:15:33.397 --> 03:15:34.168
LIAM: So brave.

03:15:34.168 --> 03:15:36.515
TALIESIN: --this is not going well for me. I'm not
a happy camper.

03:15:36.515 --> 03:15:37.830
SAM: Do you even have dark vision?

03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:38.958
MATT and TALIESIN: No.

03:15:38.958 --> 03:15:40.589
SAM: You're swimming out into the dark?

03:15:40.589 --> 03:15:42.016
(laughter)

03:15:42.016 --> 03:15:43.466
LIAM: There's torches, for now.

03:15:43.466 --> 03:15:47.397
MATT: Yeah, there's a single torch over here that
is loosely lighting the vicinity.

03:15:47.397 --> 03:15:51.007
TALIESIN: And, I assume that there's some kind of
light on the--

03:15:51.007 --> 03:15:58.472
MATT: For Caduceus-- you do have a high passive
perception. There are shapes in the water below.

03:15:58.472 --> 03:16:00.286
SAM: Oh my god!

03:16:00.877 --> 03:16:03.787
TALIESIN: Would I have noticed that before
swimming 30 feet out?

03:16:03.787 --> 03:16:10.059
MATT: No. They weren't immediately-- at night, no.
You're getting out under the dock and you-- and a

03:16:10.059 --> 03:16:14.495
little bit of light that's coming through from the
moonlight, you look and you can see something in

03:16:14.495 --> 03:16:15.924
the water.

03:16:15.924 --> 03:16:17.175
MARISHA: Oh god.

03:16:17.175 --> 03:16:19.061
MATT: That ends your turn. Yasha's go.

03:16:19.061 --> 03:16:20.658
TRAVIS: Oh, Yasha's...

03:16:20.658 --> 03:16:22.460
LIAM: 40 feet off the dock.

03:16:22.460 --> 03:16:24.236
MARISHA: Help me, Yasha!

03:16:24.236 --> 03:16:28.270
TRAVIS: Yasha assists Beau in getting the ship--

03:16:28.270 --> 03:16:31.057
MATT: Sure. You're just holding the ship. Not much
else to do.

03:16:31.057 --> 03:16:33.752
MARISHA: Oh my god!

03:16:33.752 --> 03:16:38.806
MATT: All right, so, at this point, Marius is--
there's not much else he can do. Fjord, your turn.

03:16:38.806 --> 03:16:44.907
TRAVIS: Keeping an eye out for Caduceus, start to
steer the ship along the coastline this way.

03:16:44.907 --> 03:16:46.939
MATT: All right, make a perception check, please.

03:16:46.939 --> 03:16:48.485
LIAM: Wow, Fjord.

03:16:48.485 --> 03:16:50.874
TRAVIS: 18.

03:16:50.874 --> 03:16:52.538
MATT: 18. You do...

03:16:52.538 --> 03:16:56.642
SAM: That's right. There's an old man swimming in
the ocean.

03:16:56.642 --> 03:16:57.769
MATT: You do see--

03:16:57.769 --> 03:17:01.428
(laughter)

03:17:01.428 --> 03:17:02.993
MARISHA: Geriatric bathing.

03:17:02.993 --> 03:17:04.370
SAM: Oh lord!

03:17:04.370 --> 03:17:06.044
(laughter)

03:17:06.044 --> 03:17:07.931
TALIESIN: This could not be more fucked.

03:17:07.931 --> 03:17:09.862
MATT: (laughter) I'm so happy!

03:17:09.862 --> 03:17:12.481
SAM: Don't worry. It's not what we came for. Keep
going!

03:17:12.481 --> 03:17:19.447
MATT: This went so far from any of my
expectations! I love Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons!

03:17:19.447 --> 03:17:21.547
TRAVIS: No, fuck that guy. Where's Caduceus?

03:17:21.547 --> 03:17:27.611
MATT: All right, so keeping up with that, that
ends Fjord's turn. The boat now moves on

03:17:27.611 --> 03:17:30.148
initiative count 20 to there.

03:17:30.148 --> 03:17:31.779
LIAM: Look at that old fucker out there.

03:17:31.779 --> 03:17:35.445
MARISHA: Fucking skinny dippers. What the fuck?
Polar Bear Plunge.

03:17:35.445 --> 03:17:37.528
LIAM: Oh, it's that kind of city.

03:17:37.528 --> 03:17:40.981
MATT: All right. Beau and Nott, we'll say for the
purposes of expediency on this.

03:17:40.981 --> 03:17:44.851
SAM: Yeah, I just need some help tying this fucker
up. I bring him up to Fjord.

03:17:44.851 --> 03:17:49.611
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to let Caleb out from
below. I'm assuming I could have heard Caleb going--

03:17:49.918 --> 03:17:52.215
MATT: You felt the door go (thump). That's all you
know.

03:17:52.215 --> 03:17:54.908
LIAM: You assume I'm down there, I guess.

03:17:54.908 --> 03:17:56.370
LAURA: Well, if I look around--

03:17:56.370 --> 03:17:58.330
MATT: You don't see Caleb on the ship. Where's
Caleb?!

03:17:58.330 --> 03:18:00.068
LAURA: Where's Caleb?! I open the door! Caleb!

03:18:00.068 --> 03:18:01.373
MATT: Okay, Caleb's standing there.

03:18:01.373 --> 03:18:02.141
LAURA: Oh, Caleb.

03:18:02.141 --> 03:18:05.193
MATT: All right. Caleb, you doing anything?

03:18:05.193 --> 03:18:09.977
LIAM: Yeah. I turn to the guy who-- he picked up
his weapons by now?

03:18:09.977 --> 03:18:12.136
MATT: Yeah, he's making his way up the stairs
after you.

03:18:12.136 --> 03:18:15.311
LIAM: Yeah, okay, I reach out and use Catapult,
and a drawer pulls out of the desk and slams into

03:18:15.311 --> 03:18:16.542
the back of his head.

03:18:16.542 --> 03:18:17.948
MATT: Go ahead roll for attack.

03:18:17.948 --> 03:18:19.184
LIAM: Dex save for that.

03:18:19.184 --> 03:18:22.758
MATT: Oh, that's right. Ah, it's cocked. Natural
six.

03:18:22.758 --> 03:18:26.962
LIAM: Okay, it's a failure, so that is 3d8.

03:18:26.962 --> 03:18:30.213
SAM: Does the drawer have fruit in it, though?

03:18:30.213 --> 03:18:33.315
MATT: Well, yeah, scurvy, you know?

03:18:33.315 --> 03:18:36.142
LIAM: 17 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:18:36.142 --> 03:18:40.194
MATT: 17 points of damage. (crash) Right in the
back of the skull. He's like, "Ahh!", and you can

03:18:40.194 --> 03:18:44.063
see him holding back, he's holding the sword. He's
hurt. But he's still coming at you.

03:18:44.063 --> 03:18:48.004
LIAM: (arrow noise) I am standing next to Fjord and
Beau.

03:18:48.004 --> 03:18:54.159
MATT: (laughs) All right. With an immediate burst
of speed in a rush, very akin to The Flash making

03:18:54.159 --> 03:18:59.146
his way through the city, Caleb just (poof!)
appears there on top with Fjord and Beau.

03:18:59.146 --> 03:19:00.668
LIAM: Feels good, man.

03:19:00.668 --> 03:19:06.747
MATT: The guy who's now looking at you, Jester,
you see the guy had his sword out and, "Ah!",

03:19:06.747 --> 03:19:11.579
looks confused and sees you and goes, (growls) and
is going to come up with the sword. He doesn't

03:19:11.579 --> 03:19:17.153
realize how fucked he is. He doesn't know that the
ship has been taken. He's feeling pretty competent.

03:19:18.128 --> 03:19:19.563
LIAM: He's the only one having a worse day than
us.

03:19:19.563 --> 03:19:22.761
MATT: Probably. All right, so on that, he's going
to go ahead and make his way towards you, Jester.

03:19:22.761 --> 03:19:25.447
He comes up and is going to make two swings at
you.

03:19:25.447 --> 03:19:27.021
LAURA: I use Hellish Rebuke.

03:19:27.021 --> 03:19:32.572
MATT: Well, first you have to see if it hits. That
is going to be a 15 to hit. I believe that misses.

03:19:33.087 --> 03:19:33.770
LAURA: No.

03:19:33.770 --> 03:19:34.767
MATT: That's a 19 to hit.

03:19:34.767 --> 03:19:36.756
LAURA: Okay, yes. I use Hellish Rebuke.

03:19:36.756 --> 03:19:39.081
MATT: All right, go for it. That is ten points of
slashing damage to you.

03:19:39.081 --> 03:19:39.986
LAURA: Okay.

03:19:39.986 --> 03:19:42.007
MATT: A two-handed (whoosh) swings past you.

03:19:42.007 --> 03:19:46.179
LAURA: He takes 21 points of damage back.

03:19:46.179 --> 03:19:47.545
MATT: He has to make a save, right?

03:19:47.545 --> 03:19:48.234
LAURA: Yes.

03:19:48.234 --> 03:19:52.945
MATT: That is a natural 14, but has no bonus to
his dex, so it's a 14.

03:19:52.945 --> 03:19:54.875
LAURA: Yeah, it's only a 12 dex save.

03:19:54.875 --> 03:19:56.020
MATT: Right, because it's a racial ability.

03:19:56.020 --> 03:19:57.182
LAURA: Yeah, it's a racial ability.

03:19:57.182 --> 03:19:58.957
MATT: He takes half damage? What is it?

03:19:58.957 --> 03:20:01.271
LAURA: What did I say? 21? Half of that, 11.

03:20:01.271 --> 03:20:08.772
MATT: All right. Ice shards pierce out of the
blast area and his body is (groans). He's looking

03:20:08.772 --> 03:20:13.622
really hurt now, and he's frustrated and his eyes
are starting to go a little wild, realizing that

03:20:13.622 --> 03:20:35.449
this is turning on him pretty heavily. All right.
Caduceus. (counting) You're just like, (breathing

03:20:35.449 --> 03:20:36.867
hard). As you glance over--

03:20:36.867 --> 03:20:39.480
LIAM: (old man voice) Hey!

03:20:39.480 --> 03:20:41.542
TALIESIN: Little help here.

03:20:41.542 --> 03:20:43.306
MARISHA: Is that his voice?

03:20:43.306 --> 03:20:45.228
TALIESIN: I'm not doing a voice.

03:20:45.228 --> 03:20:49.098
MARISHA: Sounds so familiar. Man.

03:20:49.098 --> 03:20:54.565
TALIESIN: Not having a good day.

03:20:54.565 --> 03:20:57.272
LAURA: Whose turn is it to get him up?

03:20:57.272 --> 03:20:58.840
MARISHA: Yasha.

03:20:58.840 --> 03:21:02.415
MATT: All right, Yasha goes up and brings Caduceus
back onto the ship.

03:21:02.415 --> 03:21:09.872
MARISHA: Where the fuck were you? Who are you? You
are clearly Cad.

03:21:09.872 --> 03:21:13.841
LIAM: A miracle.

03:21:13.841 --> 03:21:15.941
LAURA: Fjord needs healing.

03:21:15.941 --> 03:21:19.252
TALIESIN: Do I have a bonus action?

03:21:19.252 --> 03:21:21.351
MATT: You have a bonus action.

03:21:21.351 --> 03:21:28.489
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Healing Word on Fjord
before I start doing another--

03:21:28.489 --> 03:21:30.402
LAURA: Prayer?

03:21:30.402 --> 03:21:35.192
TALIESIN: Yeah, before I start doing another
prayer, I'm going to cast Healing Word on Fjord

03:21:35.192 --> 03:21:36.429
really quickly, so.

03:21:36.429 --> 03:21:38.038
MATT: All right. You got it, Fjord.

03:21:38.038 --> 03:21:39.502
TALIESIN: That's seven points of hit points.

03:21:39.502 --> 03:21:44.008
MATT: Seven points to you. Fjord, anything? Just
keeping the ship going?

03:21:44.008 --> 03:21:45.640
TRAVIS: Just sail. Yep, just sail.

03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:47.596
LAURA: I go to the back of the boat to see the
name of the boat.

03:21:47.596 --> 03:21:54.154
MATT: On this way. The boat continues on for
another 20 or 30 feet-- actually 30 feet. It's

03:21:54.154 --> 03:21:57.260
starting to get a little speed and it's picking up
the wind as it's making its way curving out

03:21:57.260 --> 03:22:03.744
towards the harbor. The guards continue running
off. These guys are all searching for the body of

03:22:03.744 --> 03:22:05.358
the woman.

03:22:05.358 --> 03:22:07.616
LIAM: Heroes.

03:22:07.616 --> 03:22:11.623
SAM: We did it, guys. Mission accomplished.

03:22:11.623 --> 03:22:17.144
MATT: The Enforcer actually technically would have
his attack on this round. I missed that. The

03:22:17.252 --> 03:22:18.842
Enforcer does his attacks on you, Jester.

03:22:18.842 --> 03:22:22.208
LAURA: Okay. Can I hit back? Because I--

03:22:22.208 --> 03:22:23.756
MATT: Yeah, you can. It's your turn now.

03:22:23.756 --> 03:22:30.952
LAURA: Okay, then... yeah. I'm going to-- I get
two attacks, don't I? No, I just get one attack.

03:22:30.952 --> 03:22:32.433
MATT: You get one attack.

03:22:32.433 --> 03:22:33.791
SAM: (pigeon coo) Don't kill him.

03:22:33.791 --> 03:22:39.402
LAURA: I'm not going to. Instead of killing him,
I'm going to say, you probably don't want to

03:22:39.402 --> 03:22:43.351
attack me. We've got a boat full of people. We
just took your ship. You should put down your

03:22:43.351 --> 03:22:44.449
weapon.

03:22:44.449 --> 03:22:46.391
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

03:22:46.391 --> 03:22:50.553
TRAVIS: As she put her hands up, he can see her
flexing biceps.

03:22:50.553 --> 03:22:53.874
LAURA: Yeah. Intimidation, 13.

03:22:53.874 --> 03:22:56.019
MATT: 13? He doesn't buy it.

03:22:56.019 --> 03:23:00.774
LAURA: What? They're right here. Look behind me,
you stupid. Okay.

03:23:00.774 --> 03:23:05.854
MATT: He's like back in-- The deck isn't very
high. He can't really look and see the ship before

03:23:05.854 --> 03:23:10.773
you entirely. He's just seeing you right there in
the way. He's just hacking at you with his sword.

03:23:10.773 --> 03:23:11.702
LAURA: Okay.

03:23:11.702 --> 03:23:14.025
MATT: So the words don't come through. He thinks
it's a bluff.

03:23:14.025 --> 03:23:15.096
LAURA: Okay.

03:23:15.096 --> 03:23:16.414
MATT: Caleb.

03:23:16.414 --> 03:23:22.557
LIAM: Oh my goodness. Okay. I will go down after
Jester and stand behind her to see what the

03:23:22.557 --> 03:23:24.331
situation is with my movement.

03:23:24.331 --> 03:23:26.303
MATT: You are down next to her.

03:23:26.303 --> 03:23:34.035
LIAM: Oh goodness. I don't want to set the-- I
say, "Hey! Why don't you put down that weapon and

03:23:34.035 --> 03:23:41.038
let's talk about this?" and I cast Friends, which
would be a disadvantage, I'm sure. You have

03:23:41.038 --> 03:23:47.736
advantage on all charisma checks. Yeah, so: It's
very dangerous. You're going to die, probably

03:23:47.736 --> 03:23:50.918
sooner rather than later unless you want to talk
shop.

03:23:50.918 --> 03:23:52.163
MATT: Persuasion.

03:23:52.163 --> 03:23:54.066
LIAM: Persuasion with disadvantage?

03:23:54.066 --> 03:23:54.909
MATT: Disadvantage.

03:23:54.909 --> 03:23:56.684
LAURA: No, it's straight. Because you cast...

03:23:56.684 --> 03:23:57.713
LIAM: Straight?

03:23:57.713 --> 03:23:59.487
MATT: Yeah, what did you roll?

03:23:59.487 --> 03:24:02.659
LIAM: Seven. Shit. That's persuasion, ten.

03:24:02.659 --> 03:24:05.711
MATT: No, you guys are all standing on the door
and going like, "Come on, bud. Come on!" He's

03:24:05.711 --> 03:24:09.333
going, "No! No! You're lying!"

03:24:09.333 --> 03:24:12.145
LIAM: I don't want to burn with the boat.

03:24:12.145 --> 03:24:17.574
MATT: Yeah, the guards aren't an issue anymore at
the moment. Caduceus, anything you need to do? Or

03:24:17.574 --> 03:24:18.613
you just holding on the ship?

03:24:18.613 --> 03:24:20.355
TALIESIN: I'm sitting and starting a Prayer of
Healing.

03:24:20.355 --> 03:24:24.550
MATT: Got you. All right. Bringing it back. Fjord,
anything? Holding the ship. Ship continues off.

03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:28.508
You guys are picking up speed now as the wind has
come in and the ship is now making its way.

03:24:28.508 --> 03:24:31.740
LAURA: Honestly, I think we did a pretty good job
after everything.

03:24:31.740 --> 03:24:33.511
MATT: You turned it around a little bit.

03:24:33.511 --> 03:24:34.758
LAURA: We got a ship!

03:24:34.758 --> 03:24:35.826
MATT: That was going bad.

03:24:35.826 --> 03:24:37.286
LIAM: This is fucking fun.

03:24:37.286 --> 03:24:39.733
MATT: Oh, yeah. That's why I love when shit goes
wrong like this. These are my favorite moments in

03:24:39.733 --> 03:24:44.583
D&amp;amp;D. The Enforcer is going to go ahead and take
two more attacks on you.

03:24:44.583 --> 03:24:47.523
TRAVIS: Nobody's going down there to help Jester?

03:24:47.523 --> 03:24:48.836
SAM: I don't know.

03:24:48.836 --> 03:24:51.716
LAURA: I'm going like "Ow, ow, ow!"

03:24:51.716 --> 03:24:57.777
MATT: You know what, no! He does see Caleb. Now
actively takes a look behind, and then turns

03:24:57.777 --> 03:24:59.282
around and runs down below deck.

03:24:59.282 --> 03:25:01.108
SAM: Wait, there's more below?

03:25:01.108 --> 03:25:03.027
LAURA: He just ran back down.

03:25:03.027 --> 03:25:05.866
MATT: He's running down below deck. You do get an
attack of opportunity if you want to take it,

03:25:05.866 --> 03:25:06.447
Jester.

03:25:06.447 --> 03:25:07.452
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

03:25:07.452 --> 03:25:08.799
MARISHA: Kill him.

03:25:08.799 --> 03:25:10.240
TRAVIS: Toll the Dead.

03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:16.991
LAURA: No, it has to be my handaxe. Yeah, that
definitely hits, 25.

03:25:16.991 --> 03:25:18.603
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

03:25:18.603 --> 03:25:21.863
LAURA: Ten points of damage.

03:25:21.863 --> 03:25:30.980
MATT: As he turns around, you're like, "No, wait!"
(shunk) Into the back of his skull. He falls and

03:25:30.980 --> 03:25:35.742
(thump), slides down the stairs limply.

03:25:35.742 --> 03:25:44.971
LAURA: I think I'm going to use my cantrip Spare
the Dying and make sure he doesn't die die. Does

03:25:44.971 --> 03:25:46.486
he die die?

03:25:46.486 --> 03:25:48.610
MATT: I mean, you put an axe to the back of his
head.

03:25:48.610 --> 03:25:53.922
LAURA: I didn't want to kill him. Like that wasn't
my goal, but I didn't say that out loud.

03:25:53.922 --> 03:25:56.482
MATT: You didn't say that out loud.

03:25:56.482 --> 03:25:57.799
LIAM: Stress of the moment.

03:25:57.799 --> 03:25:59.210
SAM: He dead.

03:25:59.210 --> 03:26:02.579
MATT: It's not your turn. You don't have a bonus
action because it's a reaction. You wouldn't be

03:26:02.579 --> 03:26:03.785
able to use it until next round.

03:26:03.785 --> 03:26:05.107
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:26:05.107 --> 03:26:09.439
LAURA: Sorry, it really wasn't my intention to do
that. I was aiming for his shoulder, and I missed

03:26:09.439 --> 03:26:10.759
and hit his head.

03:26:10.759 --> 03:26:12.932
TRAVIS: It Wasn't My Intention: the name of this
episode.

03:26:12.932 --> 03:26:14.385
MARISHA: That's great!

03:26:14.385 --> 03:26:16.884
TALIESIN: That, or the AC of Wood.

03:26:16.884 --> 03:26:20.810
MATT: The AC of Wood is a good Alpha title.

03:26:20.810 --> 03:26:23.470
TALIESIN: From "It wasn't my intention."

03:26:23.470 --> 03:26:32.964
MATT: As you pull away out into the main harbor,
Fjord, for the first time in a long time you

03:26:32.964 --> 03:26:44.352
feel-- as the stress of the sequence passes over
you, the sensation of being at the helm of a ship

03:26:44.352 --> 03:26:54.333
bypasses the momentary frustration. It feels good
to feel that wind in your hair again and to be

03:26:54.333 --> 03:27:00.303
guiding it through the waters and seeing the dark
horizon in the distance. You feel that bald rage

03:27:00.303 --> 03:27:07.608
subside. Looking past, you can see the guards are
still running up the streets with their torches.

03:27:07.608 --> 03:27:10.550
There'll probably be a search party.

03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:17.202
MARISHA and LAURA: (sing-song) You can never go
back!

03:27:17.202 --> 03:27:24.064
MATT: The good news is, you don't think they were
paying attention to the back of he ship, thanks to

03:27:24.064 --> 03:27:29.002
the distraction that you set, so they don't know
the name of the ship. That might help to your advantage.

03:27:29.007 --> 03:27:30.817
MARISHA: Which is?

03:27:31.953 --> 03:27:33.878
MATT: It is called--

03:27:33.878 --> 03:27:35.316
LAURA: Widow's Embrace?

03:27:35.316 --> 03:27:37.735
MATT: No, it is not. It is called The Mist.

03:27:37.735 --> 03:27:39.960
TRAVIS: With an I or a Y?

03:27:39.960 --> 03:27:41.560
MATT: With a I.

03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:43.538
LAURA: The Mist.

03:27:43.538 --> 03:27:52.588
MATT: Now pushing past midnight to the very early
morning hours, you make your way out and as far

03:27:52.588 --> 03:27:57.687
away from the edge. You can see the lights of
Nicodranas begin to fade a bit, just enough where

03:27:57.687 --> 03:28:04.783
you can feel comfortable. Marius is there bound by
ropes. There, still wild eyed, and looking at all

03:28:04.783 --> 03:28:12.510
this, "All right, then. Who the fuck are you?"

03:28:12.510 --> 03:28:16.867
MARISHA: Who the fuck are you? You piece of shit!

03:28:16.867 --> 03:28:18.405
SAM: We know his name.

03:28:18.405 --> 03:28:23.247
MARISHA: I know who he is! I'm asking him! Fucking
piece of shit.

03:28:23.247 --> 03:28:25.005
LIAM: That's all we know is his name.

03:28:25.005 --> 03:28:30.444
MATT: "My name is Marius LePual."

03:28:30.444 --> 03:28:35.186
MARISHA: No, we know! I'm saying you're a piece of
shit!

03:28:35.186 --> 03:28:36.846
MATT: "What did I do?"

03:28:36.846 --> 03:28:38.551
MARISHA: So many things.

03:28:38.551 --> 03:28:40.223
MATT: "I'm very confused."

03:28:40.223 --> 03:28:42.853
LIAM: What were you doing on the docks this
evening?

03:28:42.853 --> 03:28:58.220
MATT: He looks around, he's like, "I was coming to
tell some business contacts of mine that something

03:28:58.220 --> 03:29:00.221
"they hired me for didn't pan out."

03:29:00.221 --> 03:29:03.380
LAURA: (gasp)

03:29:03.380 --> 03:29:06.011
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:29:06.011 --> 03:29:16.922
LAURA: Do you happen to know where those business
contacts came from, these people? Do you know?

03:29:16.922 --> 03:29:19.249
MATT: "I don't know, they're very mysterious."

03:29:19.249 --> 03:29:24.296
TRAVIS: Would it mean anything if we said that we
come bearing gifts and that we are looking to see

03:29:24.296 --> 03:29:29.525
the Captain? I'll reach behind my hand and use
Minor Illusion and create a little replica of the

03:29:29.525 --> 03:29:32.733
cat eye sphere and hold it out in front of him.

03:29:32.733 --> 03:29:43.488
MATT: Okay. He goes, "Why didn't you say that in
the beginning?"

03:29:43.488 --> 03:29:48.206
MARISHA: I did say that. I kind of did. I was
like, Gentleman.

03:29:48.206 --> 03:29:53.589
MATT: "I don't know a Gentleman. I just know that
I was supposed to look for that delivery."

03:29:53.589 --> 03:29:56.244
TRAVIS: From who?

03:29:56.244 --> 03:30:01.856
MATT: "Whoever was going to bring it. I didn't
expect for you to come in here and slaughter my contacts."

03:30:03.556 --> 03:30:06.814
TRAVIS: What are your ambitions with it?

03:30:06.814 --> 03:30:10.718
MATT: "Nothing. I was going to make some coin,
pass it over. That was it."

03:30:10.718 --> 03:30:14.224
MARISHA: He's a runner. Who were you supposed to
deliver it to?

03:30:14.224 --> 03:30:15.729
MATT: "I don't know. Mysterious folk."

03:30:15.729 --> 03:30:17.566
LAURA: The guy we just killed?

03:30:17.566 --> 03:30:20.726
MARISHA: Mysterious folk. Where were you supposed
to drop it off? You knew where you were supposed

03:30:20.726 --> 03:30:22.926
to deliver it, so where were you supposed to
deliver it?

03:30:22.926 --> 03:30:29.256
MATT: "It was supposed to come find me in the
cove, never showed up, and they had been waiting

03:30:29.544 --> 03:30:33.661
"in town for a few days, and they were coming back
and I-- this was the night where I was supposed to

03:30:33.661 --> 03:30:36.738
"tell them-- either bring it to them or the deal
was off and I was supposed to give back the money

03:30:36.738 --> 03:30:39.780
"that I owed them. So-- "

03:30:39.780 --> 03:30:43.885
LIAM: I would like to point out that you're
trapped on this boat with us.

03:30:43.885 --> 03:30:49.263
MATT: "I know that! I am very well aware of that
right now. I'm a little freaked out, not going to lie."

03:30:49.625 --> 03:30:53.559
LIAM: Tomorrow my blue friend is going to, if we
need to, cast a spell on you and make you tell us

03:30:53.559 --> 03:30:56.880
everything we want to know. Why waste that time?

03:30:56.880 --> 03:30:59.932
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

03:30:59.932 --> 03:31:06.154
LAURA: There's also maps downstairs. I don't know
that, he knows that, never mind.

03:31:08.824 --> 03:31:10.370
LIAM: 21.

03:31:10.370 --> 03:31:19.924
MATT: He goes, "Right. I'm being truthful. I
know it was supposed to be for a captain, Captain

03:31:20.318 --> 03:31:29.599
Evantica. She's a right intense person. I've only
seen her once. She doesn't really leave her ship

03:31:29.599 --> 03:31:35.344
in port, when she's in, which is rare. Her
reputation keeps her not from coming in directly."

03:31:35.344 --> 03:31:37.135
LAURA: What's the name of her ship?

03:31:37.135 --> 03:31:39.466
MATT: "Well, her ship is the Squall Eater."

03:31:39.466 --> 03:31:41.968
MARISHA: Squall Eater?

03:31:41.968 --> 03:31:46.698
LIAM: Her reputation keeps her from coming in.
What is her reputation?

03:31:46.698 --> 03:31:53.947
MATT: "She's a bit of a forceful taker of things
she wants."

03:31:53.947 --> 03:31:56.167
LAURA: She's a pirate!

03:31:56.167 --> 03:32:02.257
MATT: "That's one word to say it. If you want to
find her, your best bet is probably somewhere in

03:32:02.257 --> 03:32:08.267
"the Swavain Islands. Don't know where directly.
I'm just hired as the errand boy."

03:32:08.267 --> 03:32:10.210
SAM: The Slavain Islands?

03:32:10.210 --> 03:32:29.474
MATT: Swavain. S-W-A-V-A-I-N. "I was just supposed
to come back here. Supposed to meet up with the

03:32:29.474 --> 03:32:38.785
folks of the Mist, the ship that you've now
commandeered. You've killed them all. What are you

03:32:38.795 --> 03:32:40.532
going to do with me?"

03:32:40.532 --> 03:32:42.228
LIAM: That is a good question.

03:32:42.228 --> 03:32:47.317
MATT: "I'm useful. I'm helpful! I can swab the
deck. I can cook."

03:32:47.317 --> 03:32:48.860
LAURA: Ooh!

03:32:48.860 --> 03:32:50.632
LIAM: What can you cook? That's interesting.

03:32:50.632 --> 03:32:52.580
MATT: "What you got?"

03:32:52.580 --> 03:32:56.152
SAM: We don't know what we got. We stole this
ship.

03:32:56.152 --> 03:32:57.770
MATT: "Yeah, yeah you did."

03:32:57.770 --> 03:32:59.732
TRAVIS: Have we patted him down?

03:32:59.732 --> 03:33:00.373
LIAM: No.

03:33:00.373 --> 03:33:01.407
SAM: I'll pat him down.

03:33:01.407 --> 03:33:03.041
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:33:03.041 --> 03:33:06.088
TALIESIN: By this point, by the way, everyone has
16 hit points added to their--

03:33:06.088 --> 03:33:08.229
SAM: 18 for investigation.

03:33:08.229 --> 03:33:13.864
MATT: Okay, you find a pouch of 20 platinum
pieces.

03:33:13.864 --> 03:33:16.080
LAURA: That's the money he was going to return.

03:33:16.080 --> 03:33:17.289
SAM: That's a lot.

03:33:17.289 --> 03:33:19.188
LAURA: That's what he got paid.

03:33:19.188 --> 03:33:26.826
MATT: You find another pouch that's hidden within
his belt pouch that contains 62 gold pieces, three

03:33:26.826 --> 03:33:34.024
silver, 50 copper, and what looks to be a pouch of
chewing tobacco.

03:33:34.024 --> 03:33:45.842
SAM: Okay. What looks to be a pouch of chewing
tobacco. Okay, got it. Could be spice.

03:33:45.842 --> 03:33:52.869
MATT: "Well, so you're not going to kill me,
right?"

03:33:52.869 --> 03:33:54.256
TRAVIS: We're not sure yet.

03:33:54.256 --> 03:33:56.597
LAURA: We're probably not going to kill you.

03:33:56.597 --> 03:34:02.385
MATT: "That's fine. That's good odds. I'll take
those odds. Can you at least loosen these a bit."

03:34:02.385 --> 03:34:04.902
TRAVIS: Tighten them and tie him to the mast will
you.

03:34:04.902 --> 03:34:11.140
MATT: As Yasha picks him up and ties him to the
mast, he's like, "Oh!"

03:34:11.140 --> 03:34:12.882
LIAM: Maybe you'll earn your way to that, we'll
see.

03:34:12.882 --> 03:34:15.770
MATT: "Okay, well, where are we going then?"

03:34:15.770 --> 03:34:19.477
LAURA: You'll find out soon enough.

03:34:19.477 --> 03:34:24.358
MARISHA: I take a handkerchief and I shove it into
his mouth, and tie that around too.

03:34:24.358 --> 03:34:25.712
SAM: Did we show him this letter?

03:34:25.712 --> 03:34:27.283
LAURA: I mean we already said.

03:34:27.283 --> 03:34:32.875
SAM: I know but, we don't know who this letter was
written to, do we? We know who it was from and

03:34:32.875 --> 03:34:36.973
what it was telling the person-- wait no, it's
from--

03:34:36.973 --> 03:34:37.806
LAURA: Ionos.

03:34:37.806 --> 03:34:39.745
SAM: Ionos. Do you know Ionos?

03:34:39.745 --> 03:34:41.621
LAURA: Take the thing off.

03:34:42.861 --> 03:34:45.006
SAM: Do you know Ionos?

03:34:45.006 --> 03:34:46.984
MATT: "No, I don't know an Ionos."

03:34:46.984 --> 03:34:48.291
TRAVIS: Shove it back in.

03:34:48.291 --> 03:34:51.528
(laughing)

03:34:52.538 --> 03:34:57.923
SAM: Well I'm glad we killed a half dozen people
to know what we already knew.

03:34:57.923 --> 03:35:00.293
(laughing)

03:35:00.739 --> 03:35:01.673
LAURA: We didn't know that already.

03:35:01.673 --> 03:35:03.942
LIAM: We did not know about Evantica or her ship.

03:35:03.942 --> 03:35:06.893
SAM: Sure, her name's right here. It says "Meet
the Captain, Evantica."

03:35:06.893 --> 03:35:07.918
LAURA: We didn't know she was the captain.

03:35:07.918 --> 03:35:09.056
LIAM: We didn't know anything about her.

03:35:09.056 --> 03:35:10.151
SAM: We could have asked.

03:35:10.151 --> 03:35:13.482
LAURA: We didn't know what her ship was about.
Let's go downstairs. Maybe we can find something useful.

03:35:13.482 --> 03:35:16.757
MARISHA: To be fair, the goal was to just ask, and
then it got out of hand.

03:35:16.757 --> 03:35:19.678
TRAVIS: Maybe there will be lunch meats down there
and we can make a sandwich.

03:35:19.678 --> 03:35:21.524
(laughing)

03:35:21.524 --> 03:35:23.614
LIAM: Caleb's heading down to start searching.

03:35:23.614 --> 03:35:24.631
LAURA: I'll follow him.

03:35:24.631 --> 03:35:30.829
MATT: As you guys all head down below deck to take
in what exactly you have at your disposal, as you

03:35:30.829 --> 03:35:34.480
are now the current owners of the Mist.

03:35:34.480 --> 03:35:36.549
MARISHA: You guys, we own a ship!

03:35:36.549 --> 03:35:39.116
TALIESIN: A ship, a dog, an owl, a ferret.

03:35:39.116 --> 03:35:40.919
SAM: We don't have our dog anymore.

03:35:40.919 --> 03:35:47.219
MARISHA: Oh yeah! (yelling) Professor Thaddeus!
(hooting) Professor Thaddeus?

03:35:47.219 --> 03:35:49.067
MATT: Professor Thaddeus is somewhere at the
city.

03:35:49.067 --> 03:35:52.591
TRAVIS: Oh! First pet down.

03:35:52.591 --> 03:35:56.851
MARISHA: I'm going to try to throw up some bait.
(hooting)

03:35:56.851 --> 03:35:58.571
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

03:35:58.571 --> 03:36:02.174
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to roll big. I'm not
going to roll big. I'm going to roll great.

03:36:02.174 --> 03:36:03.915
LIAM: We're like a quarter of a mile out to sea.

03:36:03.915 --> 03:36:06.184
MARISHA: I had him with me. 19.

03:36:06.184 --> 03:36:07.625
MATT: Not while fighting.

03:36:07.625 --> 03:36:10.712
MARISHA: Yeah, I imagine when I fought I was like,
"Go, hang out."

03:36:10.712 --> 03:36:11.717
MATT: Total of what?

03:36:11.717 --> 03:36:12.968
MARISHA: 19.

03:36:12.968 --> 03:36:17.992
MATT: 19. You're shouting out to the sky. Time
passes. No Professor Thaddeus.

03:36:17.992 --> 03:36:20.194
TRAVIS: He's eating mice.

03:36:20.194 --> 03:36:25.956
MARISHA: He is. He's happy. He's happier that way.
He was like me. He's not meant to be tied down.

03:36:25.956 --> 03:36:28.763
TALIESIN: Wow, I want to say it so bad. I'm not
going to say it.

03:36:28.763 --> 03:36:32.408
TALIESIN: He's doing what he loves best. Ignoring
everything else.

03:36:32.408 --> 03:36:36.089
SAM: We'll have a proper burial at sea.

03:36:36.089 --> 03:36:40.770
MARISHA: He's not dead. He's just running far away
from me.

03:36:40.770 --> 03:36:42.651
TRAVIS: Or he's chasing the ship and he can't
catch up.

03:36:42.651 --> 03:36:45.143
MARISHA: Professor!

03:36:45.143 --> 03:36:51.870
MATT: As you head down below deck to take stock of
what you have, we're going to end there. We'll

03:36:51.870 --> 03:36:53.438
pick up next week.

03:36:53.438 --> 03:36:55.480
SAM: Everything went great.

03:36:55.480 --> 03:37:01.194
LAURA: I think it was fun! Honestly, I think it
was terrible but it was cool.

03:37:01.194 --> 03:37:02.788
LIAM: Yeah, it was so much fun.

03:37:02.788 --> 03:37:04.262
TALIESIN: Oh man, that was a lot.

03:37:04.262 --> 03:37:08.014
LAURA: Think about when we got our flying carpet.
Like, we didn't mean to get the flying carpet. We

03:37:08.014 --> 03:37:10.783
ended up bringing the entire tower down upon
ourselves, right?

03:37:10.783 --> 03:37:12.449
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:37:12.449 --> 03:37:14.997
TRAVIS: That map is gorgeous!

03:37:14.997 --> 03:37:17.126
MATT: Thank you! That was fun.

03:37:17.126 --> 03:37:19.107
SAM: What would the captain have told us, though?

03:37:19.536 --> 03:37:20.307
LAURA: Who knows!

03:37:20.307 --> 03:37:23.455
MATT: Who knows. He got splattered.

03:37:23.455 --> 03:37:25.506
TRAVIS: He didn't even make an attack.

03:37:25.506 --> 03:37:31.080
MATT: No he didn't! He was going to be the nasty
one.

03:37:31.080 --> 03:37:32.246
LAURA: Yay!

03:37:32.246 --> 03:37:43.642
MATT: Anyways, well done, guys. You have a boat
and a handful of people in the city that saw your

03:37:43.642 --> 03:37:45.680
faces. Most of your faces.

03:37:45.680 --> 03:37:50.239
MARISHA: Man, thanks for that. You keep presenting
with stuff that we don't really want, but then we

03:37:50.239 --> 03:37:56.213
see it and we're like, "We need it!" Then we don't
want it, like animals. Now we have a boat.

03:37:56.213 --> 03:38:02.444
MATT: You have a weasel and your mom has a puppy.
And there's an owl somewhere.

03:38:02.444 --> 03:38:08.795
LAURA: Well think about, nobody that saw us in the
city, saw us taking the boat lived to tell the

03:38:08.795 --> 03:38:12.299
tale. Just kidding, all of the guards right there
did.

03:38:12.299 --> 03:38:14.523
LIAM: Nicodranas!

03:38:14.523 --> 03:38:19.468
SAM: Do we go on to the next town, or do we try
to--

03:38:19.468 --> 03:38:22.403
MATT: That's up to you guys to figure out next
time we come around.

03:38:22.403 --> 03:38:23.673
SAM: Oh my god.

03:38:23.673 --> 03:38:31.433
MATT: Well done. We'll pick this up next week and
see where the Mighty Nein are going, what they're

03:38:31.433 --> 03:38:36.706
planning to do and what the next leg of their
adventure is. Until then, have a wonderful night,

03:38:36.706 --> 03:38:40.865
have a wonderful week, we love you, and is it
Thursday yet? Good night.

03:38:52.745 --> 03:51:27.523

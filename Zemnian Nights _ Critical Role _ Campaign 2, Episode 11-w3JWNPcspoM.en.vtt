00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:05.250
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.766
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Welcome. Before we get started

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.124
tonight, we're going to get through some quick
announcements. First and foremost, we have two

00:00:15.124 --> 00:00:19.997
sponsors tonight. Number one, our fresh sponsor
for the evening is the fantastic upcoming film by

00:00:19.997 --> 00:00:27.903
the fantastic, glorious Guillermo del Toro,
Pacific Rim. Uprising.

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:33.138
TRAVIS: I got that! Pacific Rim Uprising. It's
going to be in theaters, RealD 3D, and IMAX

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:40.748
tomorrow, Friday, March 23rd. My wife and I, we
original Gipsy Danger fans, I'm just saying, I'm

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:43.588
just going to put it out there, that's what we
represent at the house.

00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:44.861
LAURA: We're big fans.

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:49.881
TRAVIS: I'm telling you. You can get tickets now
at PacificRimTickets.com. The movie takes place

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:53.038
ten years after the first film. A mysterious
organization has reopened the breach for the

00:00:53.038 --> 00:01:00.151
Kaiju, and a Jaeger has gone rogue. It is up to
John Boyega and his sweet 'stache, and his

00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.505
character, Jake Pentecost, to fight back and
prevent humanity's extinction. It is out tomorrow.

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:07.109
MATT: How could you not be more badass than
playing the son of Idris Elba?

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:14.164
TRAVIS: I'm telling you, man. I just want one of those
outfits. I just want a Jaeger pilot outfit formed

00:01:14.164 --> 00:01:16.011
specifically to my body.

00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:19.124
MATT: So if you work in the effects team for
Pacific Rim, and have an extra suit lying around,

00:01:19.124 --> 00:01:20.824
please send them to P.O.-- no.

00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:22.463
TRAVIS: Yeah! I'll work it into the story!

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:29.855
LAURA: Then a little Kaiju cosplay for Charlie,
because we were saying Charlie was a Kaiju level

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.447
negative three, or something?

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:38.877
TRAVIS: He destroys nothing except carpets with
his pee. Pacific Rim Uprising, tomorrow night, go

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:40.745
see it, because I got my tickets.

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:46.585
MATT: There you go. And of course, our fantastic
returning sponsor for the season, our friends at

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:51.709
D&amp;D Beyond. For those of you who haven't checked
that out, D&amp;D Beyond, it's awesome, they allow you

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.976
to do all your stuff online for your D&amp;D campaign,
your character. Sam, do you have something to say

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:55.857
about that?

00:01:55.857 --> 00:01:59.381
SAM: For this week's D&amp;D Beyond spot, I wrote a
hilarious skit for me and Ashley to perform

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:06.092
together, but she's not here. Instead, I'm going
to soldier on without her in the spirit of

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.986
showmanship. Hey Ashley, guess what I'm thinking
right now?

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:11.761
(silence)

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:17.768
SAM: Well hey, there's no need for that language.
Listen, I was thinking how useful D&amp;D Beyond is

00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:22.988
for tracking your stats. For instance, did you
see all the new races in fifth edition?

00:02:22.988 --> 00:02:25.192
(silence)

00:02:25.192 --> 00:02:30.837
SAM: Aasimar, I hardly knew her! 
It would be way better if she were here.

00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:35.640
Hey, I've got one. How many
tortles does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.641
(silence)

00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:38.067
SAM: (laughs) Exactly.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:44.297
Hey guys, the promo code from
last week, InvisibleWand, is still active for 25%

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:49.833
off any purchase from the D&amp;D Beyond store. But
Ash, why don't you tell them the secret other

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:52.934
promo code that unlocks everything on the site for
free?

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:55.034
(silence)

00:02:55.034 --> 00:03:02.032
SAM: Boy, I hope they wrote that one down. Also, any
legendary bundle owners who purchased prior to

00:03:02.032 --> 00:03:06.965
Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes can apply the same
code to the new book. Ashley, Mordenkainen: Am I

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:08.287
pronouncing that right?

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:09.593
(silence)

00:03:09.593 --> 00:03:12.168
SAM: Well, I don't know why you had to bring 
my mom into this, but whatever.

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:14.589
Anyway, on behalf of D&amp;D Beyond, I'm Sam Riegel!

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.427
(silence)

00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:19.307
SAM: And, as always, the motto of D&amp;D Beyond is?

00:03:19.307 --> 00:03:21.222
(silence)

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:23.421
SAM: That's the one. Thanks, everybody.

00:03:23.421 --> 00:03:25.761
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Ashley.

00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:28.402
TRAVIS: I don't know if it could've been better.

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:30.503
SAM: Ashley's parts filled in the gaps.

00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:32.678
LIAM: Oh man, Emmy-nominated, ladies and
gentlemen.

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:35.949
MATT: I know, freshly Emmy-nominated, Sam.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.459
LAURA: Congratulations, Sam.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.900
MARISHA: You have that new Emmy smell.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.281
SAM: I do.

00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:46.780
MATT: A couple other things. One, we are saying
goodbye tonight to a dear friend, our fantastic

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.614
director of photography here on the program for a
long time, Selena Ruth, she is moving on to much

00:03:52.614 --> 00:04:01.868
better pastures. We give all the love, and share
love as well for the wonderful journey that's

00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:05.856
before her. Thank you! You're amazing!

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:09.538
TRAVIS: I love your tattoos! (sobs)

00:04:09.608 --> 00:04:16.357
MATT: You made Travis cry. Good luck, and super
excited for you. Reminder, Twitch Prime, if you

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:20.367
have Amazon Prime, and you can connect your
account from Amazon Prime to Twitch Prime, and for

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:25.474
free, every month, you get to subscribe to one Twitch
stream for free, which you can do for here.

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:26.451
TRAVIS: Every month?

00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:27.299
MATT: Every month!

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:28.268
TRAVIS: Wow!

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:32.123
MATT: Yeah, it's incredible! If you haven't done
so, check it out! It costs you nothing and it's an

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:36.648
extra click. Those who may have been here
earlier might have seen we have the Critical Role

00:04:36.712 --> 00:04:41.279
recaps, so if you need a refresher for campaign
two, the first ten episodes of the new campaign in

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.603
Critical Role are now available on YouTube as the
Critical Role Recap, hosted by our beloved Dani

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:51.647
Carr, who is a longtime OG Critter, now member of
this crazy team, and the person who, if you didn't

00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:54.169
know, originated the term, "Is it Thursday yet?"

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.703
LAURA: Did she really?

00:04:55.703 --> 00:04:57.809
MATT: Yeah, that was her. That was Dani.

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:59.288
LAURA: That's awesome!

00:04:59.288 --> 00:05:03.879
MARISHA: That's 100% true. She put it on her
resume when she applied here, and I was super

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.262
appreciative of it.

00:05:05.262 --> 00:05:07.416
TRAVIS: Hard to say no to that.

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:08.398
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:05:08.398 --> 00:05:13.465
MATT: So check it out! Because Dani is awesome.
Talks Machina, of course, is every Tuesday evening

00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:18.633
at 7:00pm Pacific, hosted by our fantastic
Branredabafurser. That's for you guys.

00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:21.858
TRAVIS: Yes! And the best name yet!

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:28.321
MATT: Take that gift with you. No, but seriously,
Brian's awesome. He hosts and talks about the

00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:33.447
episode that previously happened, so tune in next
Tuesday to see about this episode, and whoever

00:05:33.447 --> 00:05:35.459
else that guests onto it then!

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:38.258
LAURA: I'm sorry, Matt. I'm sorry, we love you.

00:05:38.258 --> 00:05:39.374
MATT: It's okay, it's fine.

00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:41.771
LIAM, MATT, and TRAVIS: Oh, hello!

00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:44.110
MARISHA: Episode one callback!

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.023
LIAM: Sorry, spoilers, sorry.

00:05:46.023 --> 00:05:52.706
MATT: Liam, stop it. Podcast of last week's
episode, episode ten, is available for download

00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:56.962
where all fine podcasts are downloadable, so if
you have friends who are in the audio-only version

00:05:56.962 --> 00:05:59.735
of the campaign or you want to listen to it while
you're on your commute, it's available for

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:00.849
download now.

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.081
TRAVIS: It sounds so good, much like an audio
orgasm, just saying. Crisp!

00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:07.804
MATT: There you go. This weekend is WonderCon! In
Anaheim.

00:06:07.804 --> 00:06:09.499
MARISHA: My goodness gracious.

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:14.986
MATT: We're all going to be down there Sunday at
WonderCon for a Critical Role panel in the Arena,

00:06:14.986 --> 00:06:21.211
same area as last year. Let's see if we can pack
it full of Critters again! That'll be 11:30am on

00:06:21.211 --> 00:06:25.151
Sunday in the Arena at WonderCon. We hope to see
you guys there, bring some fun burning questions,

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:29.513
and be prepared for the ridiculousness of most of
us, but mainly Sam.

00:06:29.513 --> 00:06:30.881
SAM: What?

00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:32.505
MARISHA: I'm going to be there on Saturday!

00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:33.514
MATT: That's right! We have the--

00:06:33.514 --> 00:06:41.328
MARISHA: We have the Sagas of Sundry panel, in
room 300B, at 2:00pm I think? Somewhere around

00:06:41.328 --> 00:06:44.990
there. Then after that we have the Women in Pop
Culture panel.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.863
TALIESIN: Before all that, I'm going to be talking
about comic books in that same room at the

00:06:49.863 --> 00:06:50.973
Wednesday Club.

00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:52.519
MARISHA: Everything is happening in 300B.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:57.346
MATT: So if you're going to be at Wondercon, come 
hang out. That's basically what we're saying. Awesome. In

00:06:57.429 --> 00:07:03.920
convention news, C2E2 is coming up in just a few
weeks in Chicago! We're going to be there for

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.440
Saturday and Sunday, that's April 7th and 8th, so
make sure you get tickets. You can buy tickets at

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.684
c2e2.com! We'll have signings, panels and fun
stuff, so come say hello, please, if you're in the

00:07:13.684 --> 00:07:20.639
area. Let's see. Issue five of Vox Machina
Origins, the comic book, still out. If you haven't

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.129
had a chance to pick it up I recommend it! Is
there any new updates to merch, Laura?

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:33.382
LAURA: Oh, just that there's merch in there. Oh,
the CR shirts that everybody loved, our throwback

00:07:33.382 --> 00:07:40.296
shirts, those sold out the first night. But it's
okay, you guys! Because we're accepting backorders

00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:43.785
right now. So that's still available in the store.
I know, right?

00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:45.310
SAM: They only printed three.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.340
LAURA: Well.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.205
SAM: One small, one medium, one large.

00:07:48.205 --> 00:07:49.796
LAURA: We just didn't think anybody would buy
them.

00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:51.583
TRAVIS: Taliesin and I can't sew that fast, okay?

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:56.966
LAURA: Letting you know that if you order them,
it says it on the website, but you can check it

00:07:56.966 --> 00:08:01.960
out, it says they're going to ship in a couple
weeks, depending on when they get printed again.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.441
Just know that if you order them there's a little
bit of a delay, but it's fine, you can still get

00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:08.979
it. Put it in now, that way you can be sure you're
getting it this time.

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:14.644
MATT: Cool. Thank you, Laura. Once again, our
fantastic charity, 826, and 826LA, and all the

00:08:14.644 --> 00:08:20.064
other 826 chapters out there, they do fantastic
work with underprivileged kids and teens in

00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:24.787
creative writing, they have great classes and
tutoring programs. If you have the opportunity to

00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:29.179
donate either some money or your time, if you want
to volunteer as well, highly recommend it. Please

00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:36.656
look into it. They're awesome folks. Thank you,
guys. Let's see, last but not least, a quick

00:08:36.656 --> 00:08:44.566
retooling that I'll be at Otafest in Calgary, up
in Canada, May 18th to the 20th, and A-Kon in

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:49.366
Texas June 7th through 10th, so come to either of
those events if you can to say hello, I'd love to

00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:53.023
hang out. I believe that's it! We cruised through
those as fast as we can!

00:08:53.023 --> 00:08:55.242
LAURA: Oh god, that was fast.

00:08:55.242 --> 00:09:01.731
MATT: Without further ado, unless there are any
complaints, let's jump in to tonight's episode of

00:09:01.731 --> 00:09:03.686
Critical Role!

00:09:03.686 --> 00:09:08.940
[click, TV static]

00:09:08.940 --> 00:10:26.317
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:26.317 --> 00:10:33.372
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty
Nein, the intrepid adventurers, had completed

00:10:33.372 --> 00:10:39.208
their task they had achieved from the King's Hall
Taskboard to eliminate this spider scourge that

00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:48.594
had seemingly clogged up a portion of the sewers,
discovered a subtle passage into the more upper

00:10:48.594 --> 00:10:52.857
class elements of the city, managed to extract
some information from an individual they had saved

00:10:52.857 --> 00:11:01.218
from the webbing there, got your reward for it,
had a conversation with Ulog of the Knights of

00:11:01.218 --> 00:11:07.502
Requital, who had discussed interest in possibly
bringing you in for some endeavor.

00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:08.812
SAM: What's his name?

00:11:08.812 --> 00:11:09.887
LAURA: Ulog.

00:11:09.887 --> 00:11:20.644
MATT: Ulog. You had also, as the evening
progressed, finished your night checking out the

00:11:20.644 --> 00:11:30.167
Evening Nip, a tavern that seemed extremely shady.
Having some piss-poor ale, you had just exited the

00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:36.635
exterior of the tavern's location, out into the
midnight evening air of Zadash, still a bit

00:11:36.635 --> 00:11:41.105
bruised and beaten from the battle earlier in the
day, but eager to continue with what your next

00:11:41.105 --> 00:11:44.427
endeavor is. Mighty Nein, what would you like to
do?

00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:45.983
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Nein!

00:11:45.983 --> 00:11:54.804
LAURA: I'm tired. This was a long day. Are you
guys going to keep drinking?

00:11:54.804 --> 00:12:00.122
TRAVIS: Well, not in that fucking place, shit!
Somewhere better.

00:12:00.122 --> 00:12:02.679
MARISHA: Are we making our way back?

00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:03.798
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think so.

00:12:03.798 --> 00:12:05.271
MARISHA: Okay, let's go back.

00:12:05.271 --> 00:12:07.025
LAURA: Going to just drink at the Leaky Tap.

00:12:07.025 --> 00:12:08.609
SAM: Or just go to sleep.

00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:15.317
LAURA: I guess we won't sleep at the fancy place
tonight.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.413
SAM: It seems like it's too much work.

00:12:17.413 --> 00:12:19.484
TALIESIN: Bit of a pain in the ass.

00:12:19.484 --> 00:12:20.748
LAURA: It's a pain in the butt.

00:12:20.748 --> 00:12:24.231
SAM: Also, was there anything special about the
room?

00:12:24.231 --> 00:12:27.761
LAURA: Nope, it was just kind of fancy.

00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:29.585
SAM: Just a bed?

00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:31.069
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:33.099
SAM: No treats or anything?

00:12:33.099 --> 00:12:40.452
LAURA: There was a minibar, but I think you had to
pay a lot of gold for each little thing of it.

00:12:40.452 --> 00:12:44.910
TRAVIS: Probably one of those ones, too, where you
pick it up and it fucking automatically charges

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.488
you. Dicks.

00:12:46.488 --> 00:12:47.521
SAM: Magic.

00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:48.382
MARISHA: Is that a thing?

00:12:48.382 --> 00:12:52.937
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're little seals, little arcane
seals underneath it. You pick it up and try to put

00:12:52.937 --> 00:12:54.519
it back, but the seal's gone.

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:56.855
MARISHA: The greed of the Crown, man.

00:12:56.855 --> 00:12:58.064
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:12:58.064 --> 00:13:03.115
MATT: As the evening rainfall begins to fall a
bit harder, from a soft drizzle to a decent

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:09.397
pour, you hear the distant rolling and crackling
of thunder, as a storm front has slowly brought

00:13:09.397 --> 00:13:11.261
its way in as the night has progressed.

00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:13.835
LAURA: Hey! It's like we don't even have to bathe,
now.

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:15.526
MARISHA: I love the rain.

00:13:15.526 --> 00:13:24.490
TRAVIS: You know, if we're just going back-- Pumat
Sol, what was the name of his spot?

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.809
MARISHA AND LAURA: It was--

00:13:27.809 --> 00:13:29.152
SAM: A soul asylum?

00:13:29.152 --> 00:13:31.507
TRAVIS: No, it wasn't.

00:13:31.507 --> 00:13:32.644
SAM: That could've been a cool name, though.

00:13:32.644 --> 00:13:34.752
LIAM: Invulnerable Vagrant.

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:38.801
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. How far away is the Invulnerable
Vagrant?

00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:47.947
MATT: From where you are now, exiting the Evening
Nip, it's maybe a 20-minute, 30-minute walk to the

00:13:47.947 --> 00:13:49.076
middle of the Pentamarket.

00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:50.894
TRAVIS: Is it late evening, like pre-midnight,
or?

00:13:50.894 --> 00:13:53.451
MATT: It's pretty late evening, it's pushing on
midnight, yeah.

00:13:53.451 --> 00:13:55.473
TRAVIS: You know what, never mind, I'll do it
another day.

00:13:55.473 --> 00:13:58.078
LAURA: Should we go to sleep?

00:13:58.078 --> 00:13:59.109
MARISHA: Let's go to sleep.

00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:00.456
TALIESIN: Sleep, yes.

00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:07.854
MATT: You guys make your way back to the Leaky
Tap, heading up to your rooms, and eventually find

00:14:07.854 --> 00:14:16.675
yourselves falling to sleep. However, the distant
thunder rolls continue to quake the muffled

00:14:16.675 --> 00:14:20.961
interior of the rooms you're at, the lightning
strikes flashing through the rooms that have a

00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:28.918
respective window, and the heavy impacts causing
you to wake up in the middle of the evening at

00:14:28.918 --> 00:14:34.942
times with a restless bit of sleep. A faint drip of wayward 
rain seems to have collected and found its way

00:14:35.003 --> 00:14:41.701
through the roof of Beau and Jester's room, and
the pattering in the corner of this small,

00:14:41.701 --> 00:14:48.531
building puddle causes you to frustratingly go
and collect it, find something to at least keep it

00:14:48.531 --> 00:14:50.278
from making that noise throughout the evening.

00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:53.988
LAURA: We should fold up a blanket and put it
under there, it muffles the noise.

00:14:53.988 --> 00:15:00.907
MARISHA: Okay, that's a good idea. I hate ticking,
or repetitive noises. That's so obnoxious.

00:15:00.907 --> 00:15:02.754
LAURA: Like (tapping).

00:15:02.754 --> 00:15:04.308
MARISHA: That. Exactly like that.

00:15:04.308 --> 00:15:05.961
LAURA: Or like, (clicking).

00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:07.744
MARISHA: That counts as well.

00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:10.725
LAURA: Yeah, I bet that would be annoying if you
didn't like it.

00:15:10.725 --> 00:15:11.832
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:15:11.832 --> 00:15:20.276
LAURA: What about, like, (squeaking noises).

00:15:20.276 --> 00:15:21.991
LIAM: Keep going.

00:15:21.991 --> 00:15:27.012
MARISHA: The same umbrella category, yeah.

00:15:27.012 --> 00:15:28.078
LAURA: Okay.

00:15:28.078 --> 00:15:29.715
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation--

00:15:29.715 --> 00:15:31.219
SAM: That's a conversation?

00:15:31.219 --> 00:15:33.539
MATT: Loosely. By definition.

00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:36.326
MARISHA: We just woke up, we're real tired, okay?

00:15:38.456 --> 00:15:44.223
MATT: Mid-wee hours of the morning, you catch a
quick glance at Yasha staring out the window at

00:15:44.223 --> 00:15:46.700
the storm, quietly sitting on the floor.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.236
MARISHA: Jesus.

00:15:48.236 --> 00:15:49.447
LAURA: Yasha.

00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:51.910
MATT: She glances over. "Yeah?"

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.708
LAURA: I didn't even know you were in the room
with us!

00:15:55.298 --> 00:15:58.249
MARISHA: You're super spooky at night, you know
that?

00:15:59.699 --> 00:16:00.767
MATT: "Yeah, I get that."

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:06.649
MARISHA: You're a little pale, so you have this
ghostly quality to you. I don't know why I'm whispering.

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:08.235
LAURA: Yeah, we're all awake.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:09.578
MARISHA: We're all awake now.

00:16:11.478 --> 00:16:17.538
LAURA: I sit down next to her and I show her some
of my drawings to the Traveler that I did before I

00:16:17.538 --> 00:16:24.724
went to bed. Look, Yasha, it's rat balloons. I
show her a little drawing I did.

00:16:24.724 --> 00:16:25.852
SAM: They really are rat balloons.

00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:30.950
LAURA: Little rat balloons, and one of them
exploding with poison coming out of it.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:37.499
MATT: You see a hint of a smile at the edge of her
lips, and she gives a nod. "That's pretty good. I

00:16:37.499 --> 00:16:38.194
could never draw."

00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:45.903
LAURA: No? Do you want me to draw you right now?
I'll do it, okay!

00:16:45.903 --> 00:16:54.069
MATT: You see her pull back a bit. Another flash,
a nearby bolt causes the sky to light up. Yasha's

00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:59.589
unfazed, and her attention shifts back to the
glass of the window again, a brief moment of

00:16:59.589 --> 00:17:04.562
trance-like attention before, "You should try to
sleep."

00:17:05.462 --> 00:17:06.032
LAURA: Okay.

00:17:06.482 --> 00:17:07.515
MARISHA: You all right?

00:17:09.465 --> 00:17:16.595
MATT: She gives a nod and sits back down, closes
her eyes, still sitting in a meditative position

00:17:16.595 --> 00:17:17.272
on the ground.

00:17:18.482 --> 00:17:22.101
LAURA: I draw her lit up by the lightning and then
I go to sleep.

00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:29.700
MATT: Okay. Eventually, you all come to
consciousness again, sore from the action of the

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:36.410
previous day, but the daylight greets you, muddled
as it is from the darkened grey raining skies that

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.247
greet you. The thunderstorm is still passing
through, and a quick glance out through the window

00:17:41.247 --> 00:17:45.905
into the main thoroughfare, you can see the
streets are muddied, and in some places gathered

00:17:45.905 --> 00:17:51.844
into small pools and flooded puddles, but Yasha is
gone.

00:17:55.454 --> 00:17:58.016
MARISHA: Maybe she was a ghost the whole time!

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:01.198
LAURA: Maybe the lightning exploded her.

00:18:01.198 --> 00:18:02.934
MARISHA: That's heavy metal.

00:18:02.934 --> 00:18:07.897
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe she wandered out into the rain
and lost her memory.

00:18:07.897 --> 00:18:09.958
MARISHA: That's a possibility.

00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.481
SAM: Does that happen?

00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:12.522
LAURA: Doesn't it?

00:18:12.522 --> 00:18:13.198
SAM: Does that happen?

00:18:14.458 --> 00:18:15.909
LAURA: It seems possible.

00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:17.866
SAM: I knew I didn't like the water.

00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:22.421
MARISHA: She probably just took off to handle some
Yasha business, right, though?

00:18:22.421 --> 00:18:24.244
LAURA: Probably. We should ask Molly.

00:18:24.244 --> 00:18:24.863
MARISHA: We'll ask Molly.

00:18:24.863 --> 00:18:27.723
TRAVIS: Are we still in our rooms, or are we
downstairs?

00:18:27.723 --> 00:18:29.071
MATT: That's up to you guys.

00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:29.491
SAM: Downstairs.

00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:31.073
MARISHA: We go downstairs.

00:18:31.073 --> 00:18:31.651
LAURA: Yeah.

00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:34.715
MATT: You all gather in the main area.

00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:42.167
SAM: I just came to borrow some butter. I was
making something in my room.

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:47.858
LIAM: I got up early to use a ritual to bring
Frumpkin back, I have enough supplies to bring

00:18:47.858 --> 00:18:48.944
Frumpkin back one time.

00:18:48.944 --> 00:18:49.876
MATT: Easy enough to do.

00:18:49.876 --> 00:18:51.704
LAURA: What are your hit points this time?

00:18:51.704 --> 00:18:55.240
LIAM: I'm not here. Oh, let's find out.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.550
LAURA: Yeah, I want to know.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.079
LIAM: That's a three.

00:18:58.079 --> 00:18:58.768
MARISHA: That's better!

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:00.180
MATT: That is better.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.441
LAURA: That's at least two kicks.

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:06.824
(laughter)

00:19:06.824 --> 00:19:09.481
TRAVIS: (boom) (exhale) Damn it.

00:19:11.231 --> 00:19:18.683
MATT: You guys gather back in the tavern
downstairs. You slept in a little, pushing like

00:19:18.683 --> 00:19:24.803
nine or ten at this point, but it is still gray
and rainy outside. You can see carts making their

00:19:24.803 --> 00:19:28.167
way through the mud, some getting stuck and having
to pull through, the beasts of burden trying to

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:34.172
make their way through. The tavern interior is
fairly light, not a lot of people in there, a few

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:38.174
folks that are rushing through to grab a quick
bite and leaving or having a drink in the face of

00:19:38.174 --> 00:19:41.786
a rather dreary day. But the room is yours. What
do you wish to do?

00:19:45.256 --> 00:19:47.101
LAURA: I'm eating a carrot, you guys figure it
out.

00:19:48.471 --> 00:19:52.190
SAM: Did they say they had more jobs for us to
do?

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.099
TRAVIS: I believe they said there would be more, I
mean, we don't really have anything until this

00:19:56.099 --> 00:19:59.121
evening, remember there's that meeting that we
have.

00:19:59.121 --> 00:20:00.107
SAM: Where is the meeting?

00:20:00.107 --> 00:20:01.546
TRAVIS: It's going to take place in the cellar.

00:20:01.546 --> 00:20:07.302
SAM: Do we have a plan for how we're going to--
what if they're taking you downstairs to ritually

00:20:07.302 --> 00:20:08.207
sacrifice you, or something?

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.023
TRAVIS: You guys are going to join this time.

00:20:10.023 --> 00:20:10.867
SAM: We're all going?

00:20:10.867 --> 00:20:16.162
TRAVIS: Well, you don't all have to come. Some can
stay above. I just wanted to put the invite out there.

00:20:16.163 --> 00:20:19.362
MARISHA: We were talking about a couple people
watching out front, right?

00:20:19.362 --> 00:20:22.654
LAURA: I will watch. I'm really good at keeping
watch.

00:20:23.724 --> 00:20:26.894
LIAM: I will go with you, and Frumpkin will go
with you.

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:35.289
SAM: Oh, so I'm going in to the belly of the
beast? Sure. I'll disguise myself! I'll be just

00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:37.730
like Fjord. They'll think it's Fjord down there!

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:43.161
TRAVIS: You know, I wanted to talk to you about
your Fjord disguise. It is just a little obvious.

00:20:43.161 --> 00:20:44.204
LAURA: It's really good.

00:20:44.707 --> 00:20:45.361
TALIESIN: Too good.

00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:47.200
LIAM: Honestly, it's very cute.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.108
LAURA: You look just like him only slightly
shorter.

00:20:49.108 --> 00:20:53.504
SAM: That's the first time I've ever done that
spell. I was very impressed with myself.

00:20:53.504 --> 00:20:58.742
TRAVIS: I would want to see what your range was,
in case you wanted to, I don't know, perhaps mimic

00:20:58.742 --> 00:21:01.021
one of our other companions.

00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:04.637
TALIESIN: A total stranger would also be very
useful.

00:21:05.477 --> 00:21:08.047
MARISHA: Someone from your deepest imagination.

00:21:08.047 --> 00:21:08.591
TALIESIN: Someone short.

00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:20.218
SAM: See, that's too many options, when you can
appear to look like anything! I need to focus! If

00:21:20.218 --> 00:21:29.397
I get lost in thinking, "What nose should I have?
Bulbous, pointy, or patrician nose?" That could

00:21:29.397 --> 00:21:30.621
take hours to decide!

00:21:30.621 --> 00:21:34.721
TALIESIN: Right there, patrician! That's perfectly
fair right there.

00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:36.213
SAM: So a patrician nose?

00:21:36.213 --> 00:21:38.602
TALIESIN: Yes! See? One problem already solved.

00:21:38.602 --> 00:21:43.375
SAM: What kind of eyes? What color? Blue, black,
brown, green?

00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:44.630
MARISHA: Green's pretty.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.558
TRAVIS: Maybe just one of them. Maybe you've got a
patch over the other.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:49.899
TALIESIN: That's too many new options.

00:21:51.489 --> 00:21:55.243
SAM: A patch on one eye? What else do I have?

00:21:55.243 --> 00:21:57.050
MARISHA: Maybe you have a cleft chin.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.176
LAURA: Ooh, yes, butt chin! Those are always good!
Ooh yes, and give yourself red hair.

00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:06.823
SAM: Red hair, green eyes, big patrician nose,
cleft chin--

00:22:06.823 --> 00:22:15.326
LIAM: We're getting into Mr. Potato Head
territory. I think maybe a simple halfling woman.

00:22:15.326 --> 00:22:17.466
LAURA: With red hair and a big patrician nose--

00:22:17.466 --> 00:22:19.689
TRAVIS: Bald on top and red hair on the sides.

00:22:19.689 --> 00:22:21.573
MARISHA: Yeah. And very curly!

00:22:25.503 --> 00:22:26.605
SAM: All right.

00:22:27.465 --> 00:22:28.525
LIAM: They are pulling your leg.

00:22:28.525 --> 00:22:34.846
TRAVIS: Overalls with polka dots and a real big
bow tie. And shoes bigger than you should be wearing!

00:22:34.846 --> 00:22:37.186
SAM: I feel like you're describing a specific
person.

00:22:37.912 --> 00:22:40.271
TRAVIS: No! Not at all!

00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:43.958
(laughter)

00:22:43.958 --> 00:22:46.336
LAURA: Ooh, that sounds really attractive.

00:22:46.336 --> 00:22:47.550
TRAVIS: Just mull it over. Add it to your--

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.628
SAM: I'll think about that one.

00:22:50.488 --> 00:22:51.820
TRAVIS: You're rolling your mind's Rolodex.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.075
TALIESIN: This is going to pay off at some point
in the future.

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:55.554
LAURA: Molly.

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:56.400
TALIESIN: Yes?

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.149
LAURA: Yasha's gone.

00:22:57.969 --> 00:22:58.897
TALIESIN: Did Yasha take off?

00:22:58.897 --> 00:23:00.880
MARISHA: Yeah, she did that thing again.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.080
LAURA: She was staring at the storm, and then she
went away.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:04.694
MARISHA: Does she sleep?

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:08.149
TALIESIN: Well, yeah, she sleeps.

00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:12.337
MARISHA: She's a little creepy. In like, a hot
way, but a little creepy.

00:23:12.337 --> 00:23:17.696
LAURA: Like in a protector, I felt safe when she
was standing watch sort of way.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:18.279
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of.

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:19.045
TALIESIN: Yeah, she does that.

00:23:20.205 --> 00:23:21.120
MARISHA: It's very mysterious.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.105
TALIESIN: She's good. She's just got some personal
issues that's she's going through.

00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:29.368
LIAM: It's hard to get a bead on her because she
always takes up and leaves.

00:23:29.368 --> 00:23:30.319
TALIESIN: It takes time.

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:33.858
MARISHA: I mean, we all have personal issues.

00:23:33.858 --> 00:23:38.755
TALIESIN: I assure you; she's worth it. She'll be
back in her own time.

00:23:38.755 --> 00:23:39.680
SAM: You seem normal.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.101
MARISHA: Who? You?

00:23:41.101 --> 00:23:42.187
SAM: All of us.

00:23:42.187 --> 00:23:42.668
MARISHA: Us?

00:23:42.668 --> 00:23:43.833
LAURA: We're very normal!

00:23:43.833 --> 00:23:44.351
SAM: Sure!

00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:45.140
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.495
LAURA: I mean, you're weird. We already
established that.

00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:51.307
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, please, let's not start
calling names!

00:23:52.217 --> 00:23:55.210
LIAM: Yes, Jester, also you have a very nice
personality, but it is a big one.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.044
LAURA: What does that have to do with anything?

00:23:58.044 --> 00:24:01.101
LIAM: Well, just what you were just talking
about.

00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:04.494
SAM: He didn't mean it like that. Sometimes he's
very honest with people.

00:24:04.494 --> 00:24:07.238
MARISHA: Yeah. It did seem very pointed and
targeted.

00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:14.160
LIAM: That's because I was speaking to you,
Jester, sitting in front of me! You made the windows--

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.137
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows
like this!

00:24:18.507 --> 00:24:23.522
MATT: They all slam open loudly! Wind and rain
begins to suddenly pour in from the side, from the

00:24:23.522 --> 00:24:27.420
wind blowing it through. All of a sudden, the few
folks that are in there freak out.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.973
LAURA: Oh, this storm is so crazy!

00:24:29.973 --> 00:24:32.716
MATT: (wind howling)

00:24:32.716 --> 00:24:34.424
TALIESIN: Thaumaturgy to close the windows,
maybe?

00:24:36.494 --> 00:24:40.937
MARISHA: See, I'm having a hard time myself
getting through to Caleb, so I feel like it's hard

00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:44.102
for an asshole to teach an asshole.

00:24:44.102 --> 00:24:47.022
TRAVIS: Sometimes having a pupil teaches you
something about yourself. Just saying.

00:24:47.022 --> 00:24:48.799
MARISHA: I should punch him in the face?

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:49.724
TRAVIS: Give it a shot.

00:24:49.724 --> 00:24:51.368
LIAM: I am sitting right next to you.

00:24:51.368 --> 00:24:53.298
MARISHA: I was having a side conversation!

00:24:53.298 --> 00:24:54.642
LIAM: It's a small room.

00:24:57.492 --> 00:25:01.906
TALIESIN: This is terrifying, but I think the
three most even-keel, normal of us should go to

00:25:01.906 --> 00:25:06.222
the meeting. I don't think that the three of us
necessarily would be appropriate company.

00:25:06.222 --> 00:25:11.231
LAURA: We might stand out a little too much. It
would be easy to recognize us as part of a meeting

00:25:11.231 --> 00:25:17.583
like that. You're green, but mostly you look
pretty normal outside of that.

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:19.918
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester. I appreciate that.

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:27.618
LIAM: We'll switch it around, then? Maybe Nott,
you go with Jester. You stay up top, and I will go

00:25:27.618 --> 00:25:30.414
to this meeting. Frumpkin will stay with you.

00:25:32.474 --> 00:25:33.754
SAM: Sure. Yes.

00:25:33.754 --> 00:25:35.065
TALIESIN: This works for me.

00:25:35.855 --> 00:25:39.130
TRAVIS: You're not going to do the cloudy-eye
thing when you're down in the meeting though, right?

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:44.785
LIAM: No, because I wouldn't be able to hear what
they are saying or know what they look like. This

00:25:44.975 --> 00:25:48.215
one said she wants to punch me in the head. I
don't want that to happen.

00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:51.224
TRAVIS: You go all static channel on us, we might
be in deep shit.

00:25:51.224 --> 00:25:53.470
MARISHA: You can learn a lot of things from being
punched in the face.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.254
LIAM: I have done that.

00:25:54.254 --> 00:25:55.967
LAURA: What do you want to do when we're supposed
to be keeping watch?

00:25:55.967 --> 00:25:57.473
TALIESIN: I don't know. There's so many options!

00:25:59.473 --> 00:26:00.751
LAURA: We could find a candy store.

00:26:00.751 --> 00:26:06.154
TALIESIN: Are there any candy stores? There are
stores that specifically sell candy?

00:26:06.154 --> 00:26:08.201
LAURA: There were in Nicodranas.

00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:10.303
LIAM: Are we talking about drugs again?

00:26:10.303 --> 00:26:11.839
TALIESIN: We could be.

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:14.433
(laughter)

00:26:14.433 --> 00:26:17.608
TALIESIN: Never mind, you have a meeting to go to.
The rest of us are going to have some fun.

00:26:17.608 --> 00:26:18.872
TRAVIS: That's not until this evening, right?

00:26:18.872 --> 00:26:20.600
MATT: Yeah, it's an evening meeting.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.749
LAURA: Did you want to go see Enchanter Pumat Sol?

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:29.779
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do. I enjoyed his company so much
last time. Feel like we've got a little more coin

00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:32.641
to spend, might be smart to stock up on items.

00:26:34.471 --> 00:26:38.777
MARISHA: Maybe we can also take the day to ask
around and get a little bit more of a bead on the

00:26:38.777 --> 00:26:45.483
opinions of the locals on the current political
climate.

00:26:46.473 --> 00:26:48.445
LAURA: I have to return my key to the Pillow
Trove.

00:26:48.445 --> 00:26:49.183
TRAVIS: Why?

00:26:50.483 --> 00:26:54.605
LAURA: Because I have a key to The Pillow Trove.
They're going to keep charging me a room until I

00:26:54.605 --> 00:26:55.336
give it back.

00:26:56.256 --> 00:26:58.214
TRAVIS: Oh. Thought your mom was going to pay for
it.

00:26:59.464 --> 00:27:01.655
TALIESIN: That's assuming the money shows up in
time.

00:27:01.655 --> 00:27:02.315
TRAVIS: Oh, good point.

00:27:02.315 --> 00:27:09.131
LAURA: Well, yes. Eventually she will pay for it.
I don't want to waste all of the money she sends

00:27:09.131 --> 00:27:11.127
on paying for the room, you know?

00:27:11.127 --> 00:27:12.877
TRAVIS: That's very smart of you, Jester.

00:27:12.877 --> 00:27:15.094
LAURA: I'm trying to be smarter.

00:27:15.924 --> 00:27:18.742
TRAVIS: Should we set out to our various tasks,
then?

00:27:18.742 --> 00:27:20.283
MARISHA: You're very smart, Jester.

00:27:20.283 --> 00:27:21.102
LAURA: Thank you, Beau.

00:27:22.472 --> 00:27:24.569
LIAM: I will tag along with you again, because I
still have--

00:27:24.569 --> 00:27:25.682
LAURA: Because now you have a fancy coat!

00:27:25.682 --> 00:27:27.370
LIAM: Well, it's functional.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.944
MATT: Do you all divide into your various
endeavors?

00:27:35.234 --> 00:27:37.029
SAM: Sure. To the fancy place?

00:27:39.265 --> 00:27:42.777
LIAM: No, you go to Pumat's, I think. I don't
know. I just haven't split up with you a lot lately.

00:27:42.777 --> 00:27:44.129
TRAVIS: I'm going to the Invulnerable Vagrant!

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:47.006
TALIESIN: I have not actually seen this Pumat, so
I would love to actually take a look.

00:27:47.006 --> 00:27:48.081
TRAVIS: Yeah! You will love him.

00:27:48.081 --> 00:27:49.207
LAURA: Oh! He's so wonderful.

00:27:49.207 --> 00:27:49.839
LIAM: You and me.

00:27:50.469 --> 00:27:51.432
SAM: I'm coming with you, Fjord.

00:27:51.432 --> 00:27:56.264
TRAVIS: Oh, that's three! Do I hear four? Four?
Four? (speeds into auction chant)

00:27:56.264 --> 00:28:00.318
(laughter)

00:28:00.318 --> 00:28:01.337
TRAVIS: That's my auctioneer!

00:28:03.697 --> 00:28:04.651
MARISHA: Are you going?

00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:07.862
LIAM: No, I am going with Jester to this fancy
place.

00:28:07.862 --> 00:28:09.750
MARISHA: You're going to the fancy place.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.107
TALIESIN: Or with us, we're going to go shopping.

00:28:13.477 --> 00:28:15.924
SAM: Unless you want to go with your protégé
there.

00:28:19.224 --> 00:28:24.299
MARISHA: He's going with Jester. Yeah, I'll go
with you guys.

00:28:27.459 --> 00:28:28.875
LAURA: That's our new bodyguard.

00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:34.380
LIAM: You are the muscle. She's the muscle. You
guys are the muscle. I am not the muscle.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:43.741
MATT: As you guys divide into your two separate
groups, scattering this side, these three heading

00:28:43.741 --> 00:28:49.184
over towards the Tri-Spire. The other three of you
guys are heading towards the Pentamarket.

00:28:49.184 --> 00:28:53.722
TRAVIS: Can I grab my Mariner's studded leather
armor out of my room and bring it with?

00:28:53.722 --> 00:28:54.334
MATT: You may.

00:28:55.514 --> 00:28:58.330
MARISHA: Along the way, can I look for a tailor?

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:08.211
MATT: Sure! Make an investigation check. What kind
of tailor are you looking for, a standard clothing tailor?

00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:18.377
MARISHA: Fucking balls. Seven. Someone who can sew
me a custom coat, a cloak, or add a lining to

00:29:18.377 --> 00:29:19.643
something like that.

00:29:19.643 --> 00:29:25.380
LIAM: I could take you back to where I bought this
cloak yesterday, if you want to go there.

00:29:25.686 --> 00:29:29.525
MATT: It won't take terribly long. It takes you a
little longer. Although if you're going to the

00:29:29.525 --> 00:29:31.736
same place he's already been to, then it
completely circumvents that.

00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:33.265
MARISHA: Do they do custom there?

00:29:33.265 --> 00:29:38.028
MATT: You go and inquire. They do custom work, but
it takes a little bit of time. It's a little

00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:40.656
pricier as opposed to buying one off the rack.

00:29:40.656 --> 00:29:41.317
MARISHA: That's fine.

00:29:43.217 --> 00:29:48.456
MATT: It'll take about a day for them to finish
the work on it, and it will run you about two silver.

00:29:48.456 --> 00:29:49.139
MARISHA: Done.

00:29:50.199 --> 00:29:55.123
MATT: If you're providing the cloak. Were you
having a custom one made? Are you having a liner

00:29:55.123 --> 00:29:56.204
put in, or having a custom cloak made?

00:29:56.204 --> 00:30:01.876
MARISHA: I would like to take one of their cloaks
and have a blue liner put on the inside to make it reversible.

00:30:02.227 --> 00:30:07.444
MATT: Okay, yeah. Full purchase of the cloak, and
that'll put you about four silver for the full

00:30:07.444 --> 00:30:11.452
cloak. That includes the work, the lining
addition, and the time waiting for it.

00:30:11.452 --> 00:30:17.131
MARISHA: Like one of those baggier, poncho coats.
One of those?

00:30:17.131 --> 00:30:23.470
MATT: Okay, so hooded cloak and the front and the
back with slits for arms to come through. Got it.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:29.009
You have that ordered. It'll be ready by midday
tomorrow, they're saying.

00:30:29.009 --> 00:30:30.569
MARISHA: Thank you, sir!

00:30:32.689 --> 00:30:38.279
MATT: You guys are going to make your way to the
Pentamarket. At this point in time, it is still a

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:44.043
fairly moderate downpour through the day. As you
begin to come through, some of the carts are

00:30:44.043 --> 00:30:50.040
closed in the middle of the market: the ones that
are more open that sell fresh goods or things that

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:55.248
can be ruined by rainwater and that don't have
quite as strong of a canopy, but there are some

00:30:55.248 --> 00:30:59.377
that are still open. They have hooded lanterns out
to draw attention towards them, you have barkers

00:30:59.377 --> 00:31:03.710
shouting out, "Meats, fresh meats!" and trying to
get your attention over there, but you guys

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:09.116
maneuver through, making a beeline to your
location. Eventually you come up to the

00:31:09.116 --> 00:31:16.143
warm-looking, dark wood exterior of the Vulnerable
Vagrant facility.

00:31:16.143 --> 00:31:17.925
TRAVIS: (mutters) Vulnerable? Thought it was the
Invulnerable.

00:31:17.925 --> 00:31:18.804
MATT: The Invulnerable.

00:31:18.804 --> 00:31:19.368
TRAVIS: Oh, got it.

00:31:21.438 --> 00:31:22.325
SAM: Is it open?

00:31:23.705 --> 00:31:27.170
MATT: It appears to be. The doors are closed, but
it is warm on the inside, and upon checking the

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.032
door, it is not locked.

00:31:28.032 --> 00:31:30.219
TRAVIS: Nice. We go in.

00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:38.507
MATT: You step inside the interior and there is
one other patron, who is currently in the process

00:31:38.507 --> 00:31:43.944
of looking through one of the glass cases in the
far end of the room. You can see it's a rather

00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:51.244
portly looking gentleman, probably middle-aged or
so. His hair is curled and unkempt, but pulled

00:31:51.244 --> 00:31:59.233
close to his scalp. His cheeks are ruddy, like the
cold weather has caused him to get a bit flush,

00:31:59.233 --> 00:32:05.018
and he's in the process of glancing over as soon
as you enter. He looks sidelong to your troupe as

00:32:05.018 --> 00:32:11.366
you enter and tries to mind his own business.
There across the room, you can see there are two

00:32:11.366 --> 00:32:16.269
Pumat Sols currently, one of them smiling and
looking out your direction, the other one that is

00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:21.791
keeping an eye on the gentleman in the corner. The
one that watches you enter gives a big grin, "Why

00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:22.774
hello there!"

00:32:24.724 --> 00:32:30.019
TRAVIS: Good to see you again! Boy, it is sure
coming down outside, wish there was a way to dry

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:31.038
off real fast.

00:32:32.238 --> 00:32:36.341
MATT: "Well, if that's what you're asking, I would
be happy to help you."

00:32:36.711 --> 00:32:37.405
TRAVIS: I am!

00:32:38.235 --> 00:32:43.758
MATT: He walks on over and starts breathing
heavily on you.

00:32:44.548 --> 00:32:47.156
(laughter)

00:32:47.156 --> 00:32:50.536
TRAVIS: (quietly) Fuck. (clears throat) What does
it smell like?

00:32:52.496 --> 00:33:02.159
MATT: His breath is warm. There are elements of an
herbal scent that immediately is overtaken with a--

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:03.751
TRAVIS: Sour cream and onion chips.

00:33:03.751 --> 00:33:09.274
MATT: Yeah, it's not entirely unpleasant, but not
pleasant either. It's a warm cow-breath smell.

00:33:10.484 --> 00:33:13.830
LAURA: Oh, I want to pet a cow so bad right now,
you guys.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.242
TRAVIS: We'll see what we can do.

00:33:16.462 --> 00:33:24.480
MATT: As he takes a deep breath on you once or
twice, you feel your body warm up for a moment as

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:29.754
he finishes the Prestidigitation cantrip and you
are suddenly, immediately dry.

00:33:29.754 --> 00:33:33.641
TRAVIS: That is much better! Thank you, Pumat!
That is wonderful!

00:33:33.641 --> 00:33:36.579
MATT: "It is, quite literally, the least I can
do."

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:44.991
TRAVIS: I had a question for you: we found this
armor down in the sewers and it seems to have some--

00:33:44.991 --> 00:33:46.151
MATT: "That's really pretty."

00:33:46.151 --> 00:33:46.753
TRAVIS: Right, yeah!

00:33:46.753 --> 00:33:51.174
MATT: "Yeah, no, that's really pretty."

00:33:52.224 --> 00:33:53.921
TRAVIS: Have you seen this armor before?

00:33:53.921 --> 00:33:58.826
MATT: "Haven't seen that kind, no, but I like the
designs on it. It's really pretty."

00:33:58.826 --> 00:34:05.072
TRAVIS: Yeah, here's the thing. I spent a lot of
time by the water when I was growing up, and when

00:34:05.072 --> 00:34:11.527
you live by the water, too much water theme in
your design is overkill. You know, it's like the

00:34:11.527 --> 00:34:15.775
person that has the beach house and everything is
shells and water and lobsters--

00:34:15.775 --> 00:34:18.856
MATT: "Yeah, no, that's just a faux pas,
socially."

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:24.840
TRAVIS: Yeah. I feel like this has some unique
properties to it. Is there a chance that I could,

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:31.058
I don't know, in some way transfer or copy some of
that onto what I'm currently wearing? I have a

00:34:31.058 --> 00:34:34.237
little bit more intrinsic value with what I have.

00:34:34.237 --> 00:34:38.345
MATT: "Let me go ahead and have a look at it, if
you wouldn't mind. There we go, there's a few

00:34:38.345 --> 00:34:40.485
"other pieces right there if you want to hand those
over--"

00:34:40.485 --> 00:34:42.355
TRAVIS: They're not really attached, I'm sorry.

00:34:42.531 --> 00:34:44.263
MATT: "No, it's all right. Oh, that's a full
set!"

00:34:44.263 --> 00:34:45.915
TRAVIS: I don't know if shells fall out, so be
careful.

00:34:45.915 --> 00:34:52.226
MATT: "I appreciate that heads up. Hey, mind
helping me, me?" The other Pumat goes, "Oh yeah,

00:34:52.226 --> 00:34:57.434
"no worries. Pardon me, sir, I'll be right back.
Me, could you watch him?" The other one comes

00:34:57.434 --> 00:35:00.948
around the corner, "Oh yeah, no worries." Now the
third one has entered the room and is looking--

00:35:00.948 --> 00:35:06.106
this is a very strange sight for ye who has not
been within the store first.

00:35:06.106 --> 00:35:12.697
TRAVIS: I forgot to tell you, there are multiple
versions of Pumat. Apparently the other ones are

00:35:12.697 --> 00:35:14.012
called "Me me."

00:35:14.012 --> 00:35:18.219
MATT: The one who's in the back goes, "Well, we
only refer to each other as 'me' as we're all

00:35:18.219 --> 00:35:24.765
"technically the same individual. There is a Pumat
Prime, but he's currently not in the main chamber.

00:35:24.765 --> 00:35:28.806
"Oh, I haven't seen you around. What's your name
there, fellow?"

00:35:28.806 --> 00:35:30.635
TALIESIN: Oh, hello, Molly, hello.

00:35:30.635 --> 00:35:32.165
MATT: "Molly, hello to you as well."

00:35:32.165 --> 00:35:33.231
TALIESIN: Pleasure, charmed.

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:38.806
MATT: "Yeah." You see the mass of curled hair
around the somewhat pointed furred ears that curl

00:35:38.806 --> 00:35:43.025
back. The large smile under the broad nose.
Very--

00:35:43.025 --> 00:35:45.358
LAURA: Attractive.

00:35:45.358 --> 00:35:52.449
MATT: Oh, he's just a pleasant, jolly individual
who is massive in size, even with a slight hunch

00:35:52.449 --> 00:35:56.494
around the shoulders and back, stands a full seven
feet, probably.

00:35:56.494 --> 00:35:59.646
TALIESIN: If it's all right, I'm going to peruse a
bit.

00:35:59.646 --> 00:36:06.698
MATT: "Oh yeah, no worries. Just be wary of
anything you're planning to touch over there. Oh,

00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:10.823
"and you, you're just an adorable little friend,
there."

00:36:10.823 --> 00:36:15.576
SAM: Yes, it's nice to see you again, Mr. Sol.

00:36:15.576 --> 00:36:16.691
MATT: "Yeah."

00:36:16.691 --> 00:36:22.649
SAM: Well, I'll let Fjord finish. But I have a
request as well.

00:36:22.649 --> 00:36:26.763
MATT: "Well, we're going to go ahead and take
those in the order they've been received. So if

00:36:26.763 --> 00:36:32.143
"you could respectfully have a moment to yourself
there. We'll help you as soon as we can. Thank

00:36:32.143 --> 00:36:34.591
"you." He turns back around, and goes back to
you--

00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:36.140
TRAVIS: Nott, hands in your pockets, all right?

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.033
SAM: Don't worry.

00:36:37.033 --> 00:36:37.904
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:41.674
MATT: As the two begin to look over, one of them
is inspecting the quality of the armor while the

00:36:41.674 --> 00:36:46.837
other one closes his eyes and, as he begins to
focus, you watch as this faint little flash

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:53.076
emanates from the armor, briefly. He goes, "Oh,
yeah, no; that there is a pretty simple

00:36:53.076 --> 00:36:59.166
"enchantment right there. There are limitations
based on the strength of the enchantment and how

00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:03.612
"recently it's been applied to the equipment
involved. But since this is a simple enchantment

00:37:03.612 --> 00:37:12.698
"it is something possible to translocate onto a
similar piece of equipment. It is a bit-- there is

00:37:12.698 --> 00:37:17.668
"a cost to it should you be willing to pay for the
service, but we can probably do that for you, yeah."

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:21.264
TRAVIS: Is there any chance you could tell me how
much it might cost?

00:37:21.264 --> 00:37:30.721
MATT: "Hold on just a second." He goes in the back
room and you hear these two muffled (muffled conversation).

00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:32.708
TRAVIS: He's really very nice and accommodating.

00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:34.257
TALIESIN: Extremely accommodating.

00:37:34.257 --> 00:37:36.277
SAM: Knowledgeable, too, about all sorts of
things.

00:37:36.277 --> 00:37:38.173
MATT: (muted laughter)

00:37:38.173 --> 00:37:39.491
TALIESIN: All of them.

00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:46.288
MATT: He comes back into the chamber. "So to have
this enchantment transferred over, it's only going

00:37:46.288 --> 00:37:49.249
"to cost you about 80 gold pieces."

00:37:49.249 --> 00:37:54.495
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, a little-- 80? Eight zero, or
one eight, 18?

00:37:54.495 --> 00:38:01.646
MATT: "Eight zero gold pieces as it does require
some components to both harness, extract, and

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:04.336
"maintain the enchantment when it is put over to
the new piece of equipment."

00:38:04.336 --> 00:38:11.139
TRAVIS: Right. Okay, let me think on it a bit.
Nott, you had a request?

00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:16.531
MATT: "We'll put a little pin in that one. You had
a question there, little one?"

00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:26.201
SAM: Ah, yes. You sold my friend a haversack
before, and it has these side pouches. Can you

00:38:26.201 --> 00:38:30.916
sell me a pouch, a little side pouch, just a
little side pouchy thing?

00:38:30.916 --> 00:38:34.213
MATT: (sighs) "You see, unfortunately--"

00:38:34.213 --> 00:38:36.217
SAM: Drink cozy sort of a thing.

00:38:36.217 --> 00:38:41.463
MATT: "I mean, I can sell you a pouch. It's just
going to be a normal pouch. Part of the haversack

00:38:41.463 --> 00:38:49.684
"enchantment there is an all-encompassing object.
We have others, if you'd like to buy one for yourself."

00:38:49.684 --> 00:38:51.451
SAM: Other haversacks?

00:38:51.451 --> 00:38:52.364
MATT: "Yeah."

00:38:52.364 --> 00:38:53.526
SAM: How much were they, again?

00:38:53.526 --> 00:39:00.092
MATT: "For a return customer--" Do you have the
card still on that one?

00:39:00.092 --> 00:39:07.008
LAURA: You charged me an additional 200, but that
was also giving you the glaive.

00:39:07.008 --> 00:39:08.483
SAM: Oh.

00:39:08.483 --> 00:39:12.172
MATT: Right, with the charge on it. I think the
total cost was a little over 1,000 gold.

00:39:12.172 --> 00:39:14.176
(laughs)

00:39:14.176 --> 00:39:18.563
LAURA: We got a good discount. That glaive was
really nice, shit.

00:39:18.563 --> 00:39:22.723
MATT: It was a few hundred at least. I don't have
the card in front of me. "Yeah, I--"

00:39:22.723 --> 00:39:32.782
LAURA: I have the card, but it doesn't say the
cost. Ooh, it does, 1,350! Fuck! Oh shit.

00:39:32.782 --> 00:39:40.607
SAM: I'm okay, then. That's fine. I don't need-- I
thought that they could be broken up and sold in

00:39:40.607 --> 00:39:41.766
little sets.

00:39:41.766 --> 00:39:46.432
MATT: "I mean, we could look into possibly
devolving a small-based enchantment like that. I

00:39:46.432 --> 00:39:53.340
"mean, research and development of that does take a
while. You'd have to fund the endeavor. The good

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:59.416
"news is, when it's done you'd be the first to have
an original Enchanter Pumat Sol pocket cozy pouch."

00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:02.316
(laughter)

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:05.473
SAM: How much would that endeavor cost me?

00:40:05.473 --> 00:40:18.954
MATT: "I don't know. I'll be right back." He goes
in the back room again. (muted conversation) Comes

00:40:18.954 --> 00:40:24.940
back out. "Pumat Prime there says that for the
process of research and development, should it be

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.218
"successful, development of the object, it'll
probably be about two weeks of time of enchantment

00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:33.700
"and the cost of the overall pouch will probably
run you 200-250 gold pieces."

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.546
TRAVIS: That's mighty good.

00:40:37.546 --> 00:40:39.081
LAURA: That's a pretty good deal compared to
the--

00:40:39.081 --> 00:40:40.460
SAM: Yeah, but I'd just get the side pouch.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.354
LAURA: Yeah.

00:40:41.354 --> 00:40:42.272
SAM: I wouldn't get the full thing.

00:40:42.272 --> 00:40:43.377
LAURA: But, I mean, still.

00:40:43.377 --> 00:40:45.458
TALIESIN: What are you going to put in it?

00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:46.837
MARISHA: So many things.

00:40:46.837 --> 00:40:47.978
LAURA: Buttons.

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.207
SAM: A lot of buttons.

00:40:49.207 --> 00:40:52.858
LAURA: A regular pouch can hold a lot of buttons.

00:40:52.858 --> 00:40:59.161
SAM: That's true. I'll think on it. Can I ask you
one more question, Pumat?

00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:00.210
MATT: "Of course."

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:11.365
SAM: I don't mean to pry into your personal
existence, but there seems to be many of you. Was

00:41:11.365 --> 00:41:20.205
that caused by magic? Did you do that? Is that an
accident? Was that a splicing thing?

00:41:20.205 --> 00:41:28.793
MATT: The large looming figure of Pumat Sol shades
over you and slowly comes down onto his knees.

00:41:28.793 --> 00:41:37.850
This lurching monolith over your tiny goblin
frame. The face gets tense for a second and pulls

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:45.307
back into this very warm, toothy smile and goes,
"Oh, I like an inquisitive little girl." Pats and

00:41:45.307 --> 00:41:49.306
rubs your head. The hand is like a giant mitt that
almost encompasses your entire head.

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:51.544
TRAVIS: You get a fucking concussion.

00:41:51.544 --> 00:41:57.261
MATT: "If you look over there." He points on the
wall, you see a framed symbol: three diamond

00:41:57.261 --> 00:42:02.496
shards that all point to the center in a flux
capacitor-like design. He goes, "I'm actually an

00:42:02.555 --> 00:42:13.241
"annex of the Cerberus Assembly. So I get certain
favors and I do things for them. I provide them,

00:42:13.241 --> 00:42:19.433
"occasionally, with my capabilities and some
enchanted objects, and in return they were kind

00:42:19.433 --> 00:42:23.286
"enough to provide me with, well me, and him, and
him."

00:42:23.286 --> 00:42:27.502
SAM: So the Cerberus Assembly is that powerful
with magic?

00:42:27.502 --> 00:42:33.377
MATT: "They're about the most powerful you find in
the Empire, yeah. So me and my brothers here are

00:42:33.377 --> 00:42:36.679
"actually, technically, we're a Simulacrum."

00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:40.797
SAM: Oh. That's fascinating.

00:42:40.797 --> 00:42:43.819
MATT: "But you know, we do what we can."

00:42:43.819 --> 00:42:52.687
SAM: If someone were to want someone with that
sort of magical power, you could not provide that,

00:42:52.687 --> 00:42:55.382
but the Cerberus Assembly could?

00:42:55.382 --> 00:43:04.409
MATT: "Well, I guarantee with enough positive
reinforcement, with enough friendship attained

00:43:04.409 --> 00:43:11.155
"with certain members like I have developed over
many years of hard work and providing services,

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:17.011
"perhaps one day you too could be the fine owner of
three other versions of your tiny self."

00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:22.518
SAM: That's amazing. Are they a secretive group?
Do they have a business card or anything?

00:43:22.518 --> 00:43:26.084
MATT: "Not much of a business card. They got
members all over. Most of them are up in the

00:43:26.084 --> 00:43:35.792
"capital, but there is one of them that runs that
Hall of Erudition. Right over in the Tri-Spires."

00:43:35.792 --> 00:43:42.034
SAM: Thank you. Thank you for the information.

00:43:42.034 --> 00:43:44.053
MATT: "Of course, happy to help."

00:43:44.053 --> 00:43:50.216
TRAVIS: You know, Pumat, I think will take you up
on that enchantment, 80 gold. It's a bit more than

00:43:50.216 --> 00:43:57.729
I was hoping to spend. I could overhear you
offering an incentive for being a return customer.

00:43:57.729 --> 00:44:05.294
I did enjoy, most recently, unfortunately, one of
your healing potions. Perhaps if I purchased a

00:44:05.294 --> 00:44:10.014
healing potion and the transfer of the
enchantments, we could find some sort of a deal?

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:12.008
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:44:12.008 --> 00:44:17.810
TRAVIS: Get it, get it, boy. 12, It's not
terrible.

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:28.268
MATT: "I respect your candor. I see that you have
a keen mind for business relationships. However, I

00:44:28.268 --> 00:44:32.644
"do have to turn a profit. So I can't do much for
you there, my apologies."

00:44:32.644 --> 00:44:36.681
TRAVIS: I understand. Healing potions were how
much again? 70 gold?

00:44:36.681 --> 00:44:39.446
MATT: "No, those were 50 gold apiece."

00:44:39.446 --> 00:44:46.235
TRAVIS: 50 gold. Wow, I got to work on my fucking
memory. Great, I will take a healing potion and

00:44:46.235 --> 00:44:48.514
the enchantment transfer, please.

00:44:48.514 --> 00:44:50.747
MATT: "Fair enough. That will will run you 100
and--"

00:44:50.747 --> 00:44:51.985
TRAVIS: 30.

00:44:51.985 --> 00:44:56.500
MATT: "30 gold pieces, that's correct. There's
your healing potion. You get your basic one right there."

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:57.678
TRAVIS: Okay, thank you.

00:44:57.678 --> 00:45:01.997
MATT: "It'll take about an hour to transfer this
here enchantment for you. So be patient and come

00:45:01.997 --> 00:45:05.009
"back in about 60 minutes. Should be ready to go."

00:45:05.009 --> 00:45:11.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, I take the breastplate part of my
leather armor off and leave it with you.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:15.793
MATT: "Oh, this is-- want us to clean it for
you?"

00:45:15.793 --> 00:45:17.926
TRAVIS: Yeah, that would be--

00:45:17.926 --> 00:45:19.609
TALIESIN: Yes, please clean it. Please.

00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:20.917
MATT: "All right."

00:45:20.917 --> 00:45:22.464
TRAVIS: It's not that bad. You don't have to act
like it--

00:45:22.464 --> 00:45:24.785
TALIESIN: It was starting to-- it has a brine.

00:45:24.785 --> 00:45:27.888
MATT: "Would you prefer black ice, lavender or new
leather?"

00:45:27.888 --> 00:45:29.767
TRAVIS: New leather.

00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:32.148
MATT: "New leather it is. We'll get it right to
you."

00:45:32.148 --> 00:45:34.588
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

00:45:34.588 --> 00:45:36.100
MATT: Turns around.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.527
TALIESIN: I've been doing a perusal, by the way. Is
there anything that's caught my eye in this--?

00:45:39.527 --> 00:45:41.324
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:45:41.324 --> 00:45:48.012
TALIESIN: Make an investigation check. It's hard
to concentrate, 13.

00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:53.416
MATT: Okay, there's a lot of things here. Many not
anywhere near your price range.

00:45:53.416 --> 00:45:54.693
TALIESIN: Sure.

00:45:54.693 --> 00:46:02.555
MATT: There are three that catch your eye that are
loosely interesting, at least, between you and your

00:46:02.555 --> 00:46:13.763
allies. There is one pendant that has a darkened
ivory spiral and almost a heart sculpture, but it

00:46:13.763 --> 00:46:16.417
is roughly sculpted.

00:46:16.417 --> 00:46:18.152
TALIESIN: Interesting.

00:46:18.152 --> 00:46:26.050
MATT: That is currently labeled with a fine ribbon
at the bottom at 150 gold. It states that it has

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:32.503
the capability of-- you can almost hear it in his
voice after seeing and meeting him for this short

00:46:32.503 --> 00:46:39.268
time. "It's capable of ensuring that if you take
too many hits it will help prevent you from bleeding

00:46:39.268 --> 00:46:41.294
"out on your own."

00:46:41.294 --> 00:46:43.588
LAURA: That's good.

00:46:43.588 --> 00:46:47.925
MATT: "Also, when you take a rest, you get a
little bit of a bonus when healing."

00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:51.500
TALIESIN: All right, that's interesting.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:47:04.535
MATT: There's one of them that's this darkened,
orangeish, amber-colored orb or marble about that

00:47:04.535 --> 00:47:07.495
big. That is 350 gold.

00:47:07.495 --> 00:47:09.141
LAURA: Whoa.

00:47:09.141 --> 00:47:17.007
MATT: The ribbon attached to that one states,
"Should someone holding this have the capability

00:47:17.007 --> 00:47:22.503
"of spinning spells one way or the other, they could
probably keep one stored in this thing and release

00:47:22.503 --> 00:47:26.853
"it at a later time."

00:47:26.853 --> 00:47:29.282
MARISHA: I had one of those last campaign.

00:47:29.282 --> 00:47:30.975
LAURA: That was a ring.

00:47:30.975 --> 00:47:33.827
MARISHA: That was a ring of holding, yeah. Good
stuff.

00:47:33.827 --> 00:47:35.470
TALIESIN: The final piece that I noticed?

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:41.694
MATT: Yes, this is a really beautiful cloak that
has a purplish-blue color to it with very fine

00:47:41.694 --> 00:47:48.170
edged embroidery in gold and silver that naturally
comes out of the cloak like it's growing silver

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:56.897
vines at the edges of it. It's a very fine make.
This one is labeled at 800 gold. "The donner of

00:47:56.897 --> 00:48:03.865
"this cloak would find themselves largely protected
in certain ways from the elements, or blows, or

00:48:03.865 --> 00:48:05.523
"magics, or what have you."

00:48:05.523 --> 00:48:08.420
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.508
LAURA: It's like a cloak of AC? No, like
resistance?

00:48:11.508 --> 00:48:13.145
MATT: Cloak of protection.

00:48:13.145 --> 00:48:15.093
LAURA: Cloak of protection, like ring of
protection.

00:48:15.093 --> 00:48:16.839
TRAVIS: It gives you some bonus.

00:48:16.839 --> 00:48:18.415
LAURA: Man, I want a ring of protection again.

00:48:18.415 --> 00:48:19.792
TRAVIS: Yeah, we all do.

00:48:19.792 --> 00:48:21.022
TALIESIN: We all do.

00:48:21.022 --> 00:48:22.444
TRAVIS: Super squishy-ass, crispy tacos.

00:48:22.444 --> 00:48:27.016
SAM: What if we kill all of Pumat Sol and come
back and rob this place?

00:48:27.016 --> 00:48:28.413
TALIESIN: That's a great plan.

00:48:28.413 --> 00:48:29.698
MATT: That's an option.

00:48:29.698 --> 00:48:31.677
TRAVIS: I think you only have to kill the one.

00:48:31.677 --> 00:48:32.550
LIAM: Prime.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.285
TRAVIS: This conversation did not happen in the
game, by the way.

00:48:35.285 --> 00:48:37.117
MATT: Oh, I assumed.

00:48:37.117 --> 00:48:40.179
TALIESIN: What did we each make off of--

00:48:40.179 --> 00:48:45.707
SAM: You should be tracking it in your D&amp;D Beyond
currency counter.

00:48:45.707 --> 00:48:47.077
LAURA: We didn't put that in our--

00:48:47.077 --> 00:48:49.087
SAM: I added my 100. We each got 100.

00:48:49.087 --> 00:48:50.979
LAURA: Oh, I think I added it.

00:48:50.979 --> 00:48:52.150
MATT: Yeah, it was 700 gold.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.041
TALIESIN: Okay, so I did. So I can technically
afford this.

00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:55.574
LAURA: Well, one of them.

00:48:55.574 --> 00:48:59.865
TALIESIN: I'd love to see that heart locket if you
don't mind. This thing.

00:48:59.865 --> 00:49:01.632
LAURA: Did you spit on my thing--

00:49:01.632 --> 00:49:03.099
SAM: Probably, you made me laugh.

00:49:03.099 --> 00:49:05.403
MATT: There's the two guys are like, "Sorry, can't
help you, we're in mid-enchantment translocation.

00:49:05.403 --> 00:49:09.104
"Could you help him?" The other one's like, "Yeah,
no worries, I got you. Hey there, buddy, what you

00:49:09.104 --> 00:49:10.874
"looking at over there for?"

00:49:10.874 --> 00:49:13.885
TALIESIN: Pleasure to meet you. I was looking at
this piece right here.

00:49:13.885 --> 00:49:19.249
MATT: "Oh yeah, no. Let me pass you over a little
more information about that. That's a periapt of

00:49:19.249 --> 00:49:29.108
"wound closure, if you're so interested. It both
allows you to stabilize when you hit zero hit

00:49:29.108 --> 00:49:33.422
"points, and when you're using hit dice to heal up,
it's a little bit nicer."

00:49:33.422 --> 00:49:39.330
LAURA: Is this like, if I'm healing him, does he
still get the double hit points?

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.268
MATT: "Just when it's doing hit dice."

00:49:41.268 --> 00:49:42.438
LAURA: Sorry.

00:49:42.438 --> 00:49:44.041
TRAVIS: Got to attune to it?

00:49:44.041 --> 00:49:48.083
SAM: Wound closure? You cut yourself all the time,
that would be very useful.

00:49:48.083 --> 00:49:50.481
TALIESIN: They tend to sort of heal themselves,
though.

00:49:50.481 --> 00:49:54.751
LIAM: Is it reusable?

00:49:54.751 --> 00:50:01.771
TALIESIN: This is quite nice, oh yeah. You know what? I
think I'm going to treat myself, I'm going to take

00:50:01.771 --> 00:50:08.234
it. I feel like I've earned something, we've had a
good run of it, and I have never spent this much

00:50:08.234 --> 00:50:09.764
money on anything in my life.

00:50:09.764 --> 00:50:13.555
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, we've got some good momentum
right now, right? What could possibly happen?

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:18.001
MATT: "Not going to lie, really appreciative to
have, just here in a few days, returning customers

00:50:18.001 --> 00:50:22.501
"willing to spend fine, hard-earned gold on some
finely crafted and enchanted objects."

00:50:22.501 --> 00:50:26.097
TALIESIN: I pass 150 gold.

00:50:26.097 --> 00:50:31.488
MATT: "An absolute pleasure there, you say it was
Mollyoop?"

00:50:31.488 --> 00:50:33.150
TALIESIN: Just Molly to my friends.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:34.703
MATT: "Molly it is."

00:50:34.703 --> 00:50:38.271
TALIESIN: This is wonderful. I'm going to add it
to my other necklace.

00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:42.225
TRAVIS: It looks incredible. It's found a place.

00:50:42.225 --> 00:50:44.522
TALIESIN: I feel, it's right to my heart. Right
there.

00:50:44.522 --> 00:50:50.969
TRAVIS: Pumat, before we go, I wanted to ask you, I
know that you're an annex of the Cerberus

00:50:50.969 --> 00:50:55.767
Assembly. How do you feel about the governing
parties here in town? Are you happy with the way

00:50:55.767 --> 00:50:57.199
things are run?

00:50:57.199 --> 00:51:01.953
MATT: "I mean, overall it seems to be as fine as
it can be."

00:51:01.953 --> 00:51:02.911
TRAVIS: Right.

00:51:02.911 --> 00:51:07.822
MATT: "You know, some folks don't have as much
coin as others, but what can you do to really help

00:51:07.822 --> 00:51:14.016
"them? We do what we can, but there's a lot of
dangerous things out there. We got all sorts of

00:51:14.016 --> 00:51:19.608
"baddies coming over from Xhorhas, we got the
possible encroaching of foreign powers always

00:51:19.608 --> 00:51:28.188
"looking to peek over the mountain range and try
and steal some of our hard-earned materials. So I

00:51:28.188 --> 00:51:38.515
"think it's good they keep us nice and safe and, I
mean, I got myself a fine business, too."

00:51:38.515 --> 00:51:43.540
TRAVIS: Yeah. I think it's great that you support
the barracks. Do they come in for regular

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:49.121
purchases every week or every month or find
themselves in your store more often than not?

00:51:49.121 --> 00:51:51.385
MATT: "Who are you referring to?"

00:51:51.385 --> 00:51:53.852
TRAVIS: The members of the Cerberus Assembly.

00:51:53.852 --> 00:52:00.039
MATT: "Oh no, they don't come to the store often.
They usually send requests, they make orders and I

00:52:00.039 --> 00:52:04.531
"have them sent on over to either Rexxentrum or the
Hall, if that's where they're going to be

00:52:04.531 --> 00:52:05.893
"utilizing them."

00:52:05.893 --> 00:52:08.866
TRAVIS: That's wonderful. Well, thank you, thank
you for your time.

00:52:08.866 --> 00:52:14.399
MATT: "No worries. They're a fine bunch. They do a
lot of good, they keep the Crown in check, they

00:52:14.399 --> 00:52:23.577
"make sure there's no abuse of power and they also
have been very staunch supporters of helping

00:52:23.577 --> 00:52:29.419
"promote learning here in the smaller, more middle
to lower classes here in Zadash."

00:52:29.419 --> 00:52:34.953
TRAVIS: Oh really? They're not as protective of
certain knowledges as other parts of the

00:52:34.953 --> 00:52:36.454
government might be?

00:52:36.454 --> 00:52:40.890
MATT: "Well, I mean, protective of knowledge in
the sense that not everyone can be trusted with

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:45.896
"knowledge and, I'm not going to lie, some of the
things even I know could be real dangerous in the

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:53.535
"wrong hands, so I think it's important there has
to be a certain level of control. I've seen some

00:52:53.535 --> 00:52:58.374
"really nutty people out there that I can't imagine
what it would be like if we didn't have some sort

00:52:58.374 --> 00:53:00.041
"of law and order."

00:53:00.041 --> 00:53:03.959
TRAVIS: But they might be a bit more open-minded
to people sharing in that knowledge if they were

00:53:03.959 --> 00:53:05.741
the right type of person, say?

00:53:05.741 --> 00:53:08.244
MATT: "Could very well be! They've been very kind
to me."

00:53:08.244 --> 00:53:14.008
TRAVIS: I'm glad to hear that. Nott? Molly? You
have everything you need?

00:53:14.008 --> 00:53:15.534
SAM: Yes.

00:53:15.534 --> 00:53:20.507
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've been looking in the little
mirror, trying to get the height right.

00:53:20.507 --> 00:53:23.121
TRAVIS: Did you want to bring the mirror with you?

00:53:23.121 --> 00:53:24.801
TALIESIN: Can I?

00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:26.172
TRAVIS: I was joking.

00:53:26.172 --> 00:53:28.737
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. Fine. This is good.
Okay.

00:53:28.737 --> 00:53:30.692
SAM: We'll probably be back in like a day.

00:53:30.692 --> 00:53:32.214
TALIESIN: We'll be back.

00:53:32.214 --> 00:53:34.796
MATT: "Well, we'll be here. All four of us."

00:53:34.796 --> 00:53:37.853
SAM: Goodbye, Pumats Sol.

00:53:37.853 --> 00:53:41.351
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you, little goblin lady!"

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:43.262
TRAVIS: Give Pumat Prime our best.

00:53:43.262 --> 00:53:47.888
MATT: "I will. Right now." He goes in the back
room as the other two are still focusing on your

00:53:47.888 --> 00:53:51.398
armor. As you leave the two that are focusing go,
"Thank you!" "Thank you!"

00:53:51.398 --> 00:53:54.463
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:53:54.463 --> 00:54:01.220
MATT: You wait the better part of an hour, are
able to retrieve your armor, and indeed you now

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:05.414
have the Mariner's armor enchantment on your
breastplate.

00:54:05.414 --> 00:54:10.849
TRAVIS: Thank you for not making me stand out in
the rain for an hour without top pieces. Thank you.

00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:20.199
MATT: Now, the three of you. So what means are you
attempting to enter the Tri-Spires?

00:54:20.199 --> 00:54:22.682
LAURA: We go back to the gate, right?

00:54:22.682 --> 00:54:27.670
LIAM: Yeah. You know, I had that bad time
yesterday, but probably different guards there and

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:29.587
I have this cloak now so I'm going to--

00:54:29.587 --> 00:54:34.616
LAURA: You look really-- can I? I'm going to brush
your hair out of your face.

00:54:34.616 --> 00:54:35.852
LIAM: Yeah.

00:54:35.852 --> 00:54:38.775
LAURA: And like, wipe at any dirt off your face,
okay?

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.493
LIAM: Oh, the rain has already taken care of most
of that.

00:54:40.493 --> 00:54:44.497
LAURA: I know. Well, it's washed it off, but now
I've got to get the smudges off. Because, you

00:54:44.497 --> 00:54:46.192
know, it's still kind of there.

00:54:46.192 --> 00:54:48.057
LIAM: Thank you. Is it good?

00:54:48.057 --> 00:54:54.454
LAURA: Well, you look sparkling clean! You look
very dashing.

00:54:54.454 --> 00:54:57.932
LIAM: Okay. We'll see if the guards think so, eh?

00:54:57.932 --> 00:55:03.652
LAURA: Yes. Just keep your cloak really tight on
you, okay?

00:55:03.652 --> 00:55:05.304
LIAM: That's the idea, yeah.

00:55:05.304 --> 00:55:08.972
MATT: You find yourselves to the exterior of the
Tri-Spires, the familiar gate where you've

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:15.508
traversed and failed to traverse once before. As
you make your way towards the edge, you see the

00:55:15.508 --> 00:55:21.142
two guards once again step up to the center to
prevent entry. As they begin to walk up, you see

00:55:21.142 --> 00:55:28.259
three other figures are exiting the district, and
the guards stop, "Halt." Give a nod, recognizing

00:55:28.303 --> 00:55:35.797
the individuals as they walk past, they move on.
They look to be fairly decently dressed, a male

00:55:35.797 --> 00:55:40.965
and a female. You don't know if they're married or
not, but they appear to be a couple. A friend of

00:55:40.965 --> 00:55:46.623
theirs is off to the side. All in cloaks, hoods
up, very nice cloaks, thick but very well-made as

00:55:46.623 --> 00:55:51.606
the rain is still coming down. They're all bundled
up, but there is a point of recognition with the

00:55:51.606 --> 00:55:56.729
guards as they pass by. As they move beyond, the
guards once again approach and they're like, "Halt."

00:55:56.729 --> 00:55:58.764
LAURA: Oh, hello again.

00:55:58.764 --> 00:56:00.743
MATT: "Hello again."

00:56:00.743 --> 00:56:04.385
LAURA: Yes. We're making our way to the Pillow
Trove. That's all.

00:56:04.385 --> 00:56:07.388
MATT: They both give a look over the two of you.

00:56:07.388 --> 00:56:10.744
MARISHA: I'm all nice and buttoned up. Belt tied.

00:56:10.744 --> 00:56:12.855
LIAM: I'm looking at the ground.

00:56:12.855 --> 00:56:15.324
MARISHA: Looking tough.

00:56:15.324 --> 00:56:18.847
MATT: For the sake of this, make a persuasion
check, Jester.

00:56:18.847 --> 00:56:27.412
LAURA: Oh, Jesus. Okay. That was not a lot of
flourish there, but 17!

00:56:27.412 --> 00:56:29.639
TALIESIN: It went back to a 20.

00:56:29.639 --> 00:56:30.855
LAURA: I know it did.

00:56:30.855 --> 00:56:38.164
MATT: "All right. Come in." You guys quickly make your way
through the open gates, under the portcullis, into

00:56:38.164 --> 00:56:44.175
the cobblestone streets of the Tri-Spires, and there
you see the Silken Terrace, the three towers that

00:56:44.175 --> 00:56:46.697
mark the central part of Zadash.

00:56:46.697 --> 00:56:52.728
LAURA: (giggles) We made it!

00:56:52.728 --> 00:56:54.488
LIAM: It's nice in here.

00:56:54.488 --> 00:56:58.510
LAURA: I know, right?! Should we ask where the
smutty shop is that you want to go to?

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:02.529
LIAM: It has a name. It is called Chastity's
Nook.

00:57:02.529 --> 00:57:07.098
MARISHA and LAURA: (laughter)

00:57:07.098 --> 00:57:08.685
LIAM: Yes, it's right in the name.

00:57:08.685 --> 00:57:09.778
MARISHA: It's a good name.

00:57:09.778 --> 00:57:11.949
LAURA: I go back to the guard and ask where the
Chastity's Nook is.

00:57:11.949 --> 00:57:24.190
MATT: "I-- oh." He gives you this weird look as
you ask him. He's like, "Actually, it's right there

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:30.239
"in the Silken Terrace to the left of the large
bakery. It's the hut-looking thing."

00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:35.714
LAURA: Thank you very much, I appreciate all of
your help, you've been wonderful, okay, bye.

00:57:35.714 --> 00:57:40.823
MATT: "Of course," he says behind you as you rush
off.

00:57:40.876 --> 00:57:45.924
SAM: A bakery <i>and</i> a porn shop? If they find a
fight club, you guys are going to be orgasming!

00:57:45.924 --> 00:57:49.043
(laughter)

00:57:49.043 --> 00:57:51.935
TALIESIN: To be fair, they make pornographic cakes
there, so it's all right.

00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:53.371
MATT: It's pretty great.

00:57:53.371 --> 00:57:55.518
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh!

00:57:55.518 --> 00:58:04.302
MATT: Bringing in an American Pie reference, wow.
You enter the Silken Terrace. First off, the

00:58:04.302 --> 00:58:09.998
beautiful cobblestone streets before you are
broken up by small patches of small fenced-in

00:58:09.998 --> 00:58:15.270
shrubbery and flower bushes. The whole interior
here is such stark contrast to the rest of the

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:21.849
city. It is both surprising and sickening knowing
some of the harder lifestyles that exist on the

00:58:21.849 --> 00:58:34.922
outside of the walls here. There are a few large
sights as you pass through here. There is-- one of

00:58:34.922 --> 00:58:41.617
the large towers here is part of the ivory and
marble structure that has large blue banners that

00:58:41.617 --> 00:58:51.594
hang down the sides. The central tower itself
fires up into the sky. This centerpiece-- and

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:55.384
you've known this because you've been here before--
is known as the Zauber Spire.

00:58:55.447 --> 00:58:57.918
MARISHA: Zombra Spire-- Zombra?

00:58:57.918 --> 00:59:10.714
MATT: Zauber Spire. Z-A-U-B-E-R S-P-I-R-E. The
Zauber Spire. It is the central piece of the Halls

00:59:10.767 --> 00:59:15.313
of Erudition campus and lords over that entire
section to the north side. It is the furthest

00:59:15.313 --> 00:59:24.537
tower here. There is an area that you've heard of but
not been to called the Gilded Willows, which is

00:59:24.537 --> 00:59:31.311
the tree-dappled residential area of the city.
It's broken up into several pieces, but you can see a

00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:36.569
lot of the treetops, and there is this very
natural, almost picturesque beauty of the interior.

00:59:36.569 --> 00:59:38.558
LIAM: What was that called again?

00:59:38.558 --> 00:59:42.188
MATT: The Gilded Willows. It's the broken up
residential aspects of this area.

00:59:42.188 --> 00:59:45.385
MARISHA: Okay, it's Bel-Air.

00:59:45.385 --> 00:59:56.437
MATT: Yeah. There is the Triumph Chime, which is a
seven-story temple and belfry that has been

00:59:56.437 --> 01:00:00.240
retrofitted as the previous-- and you would know
this from learning your history lessons--

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.297
actually, make a history check.

01:00:02.297 --> 01:00:03.648
MARISHA: Okay!

01:00:03.648 --> 01:00:04.760
TRAVIS: Maybe you know it.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.088
MATT: You might not remember it.

01:00:06.088 --> 01:00:12.341
MARISHA: It was so good, too! Almost! Did you see
that? History? Six.

01:00:12.465 --> 01:00:22.808
MATT: All right. You know that it's there. You
know the three towers are there. There's the

01:00:22.808 --> 01:00:28.997
Zauber Spire; the Constellation Bridge in the
Gilded Willows, which is a giant watchtower that

01:00:28.997 --> 01:00:35.895
overlooks the entirety of this city; and then the
last bit is the Triumph Chime, but that's all you

01:00:35.895 --> 01:00:37.122
know about them.

01:00:37.122 --> 01:00:43.020
MARISHA: Yeah, it's, like, the Zauber Spire, the
Constellation Bridge, and whatever the Triumph

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:52.568
Tower is. Chime. I think it's a church. Or a cult.
Or a church-turned-cult. I don't remember.

01:00:52.568 --> 01:00:54.941
LAURA: The Constellation Bridge sounds very
pretty.

01:00:54.941 --> 01:00:55.871
MARISHA: It is.

01:00:55.871 --> 01:00:56.919
LIAM: It's a good name.

01:00:56.919 --> 01:01:01.999
MATT: As you continue in the direction of where
you were guided, you come upon the very familiar

01:01:01.999 --> 01:01:10.454
scent of warm baked goods, both savory and sweet.
It is relatively crowded. A lot of the folks are

01:01:10.454 --> 01:01:17.685
bundled up. They have large mittens on, heavy
coats and cloaks and a lot of the general elite

01:01:17.685 --> 01:01:22.331
that live in this vicinity have come here to pick
up warm goods to help go against the cold rain

01:01:22.331 --> 01:01:28.415
that's now coming down upon the city. To the right
of that, towards the very edge of this road of

01:01:28.415 --> 01:01:38.190
various shops and market bits, there is a building
that is small with a thatched roof, like it's more

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:42.605
for the visual aspect of it. It's made to look
almost like a small country cottage but it's

01:01:42.605 --> 01:01:48.176
plainly intentional and is an aesthetic that's
been placed onto it to make it look different and

01:01:48.176 --> 01:01:49.980
interesting from the rest of the--

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:50.942
MARISHA: Like a tiki bar!

01:01:50.942 --> 01:01:57.329
MATT: Yeah, I guess you could say that. Outside
you do see a sign that is written in beautiful

01:01:57.329 --> 01:02:06.218
cursive that's arched over the main door that says
"Chastity's Nook." The doorway is slightly open,

01:02:06.218 --> 01:02:10.494
and there is a warm light from the interior. There
is a glass window. There are books on display

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:18.016
there, but you already see a few people inside.
It's not packed, but it's making business. What do

01:02:18.016 --> 01:02:19.113
you guys want to do?

01:02:19.428 --> 01:02:24.493
LIAM: Just before we head that way, just out of
curiosity, what is the name of the bakery that is near?

01:02:24.944 --> 01:02:28.765
MATT: You actually can't see the name from the
outside. You'd have to go and ask.

01:02:28.765 --> 01:02:32.090
LIAM: I go and ask. I walk into the-- come, are
you hungry?

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:34.052
LAURA: I always am hungry!

01:02:34.052 --> 01:02:36.472
LIAM: Okay, I will get us some sweets if you want.

01:02:36.472 --> 01:02:38.014
LAURA: Really?

01:02:38.014 --> 01:02:42.178
LIAM: Yeah, sure, why not? We are flush at the
moment. I walk in.

01:02:42.178 --> 01:02:48.368
MATT: Easy enough to ask. As you walk inside,
there is a whole table set up with warm goods and

01:02:48.368 --> 01:02:52.866
a kitchen that's constantly going. There's about
12 patrons in there right now in the process of

01:02:52.866 --> 01:02:57.810
eating or ordering. It's called the Meal Hearth.

01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:00.810
TRAVIS: Your hands are going to be all sticky
before you handle the books.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.885
LIAM: Better than after.

01:03:02.885 --> 01:03:10.706
(groaning and laughter)

01:03:12.451 --> 01:03:14.856
MATT: If you'd like to, you can load up on--

01:03:14.856 --> 01:03:18.116
LIAM: Yeah, what are you in the mood for? Do you
want something sweet or something savory?

01:03:18.116 --> 01:03:22.978
LAURA: Oh man, this bakery that we had in
Nicodranas had amazing bear claws.

01:03:22.978 --> 01:03:28.606
LIAM: Bear claws. Well let's see. Excuse me?
Whoever's running this show.

01:03:28.606 --> 01:03:35.003
MATT: In the midst of the chaos you see a young
man in his late teens or so with a little bit of a

01:03:35.003 --> 01:03:43.553
prickly chinstrap beard, very short, tattered
brown hair but other than that spry, smiling. He

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:47.990
has an apron on, and he's currently putting a
small tray on the edge, "Hello. Can I help you?"

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:51.528
LIAM: Yeah, we're in the mood for some bear claws,
the kind they have in Nicodranas. Have you heard

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:53.375
of these? Do you have them?

01:03:53.375 --> 01:04:00.414
MATT: "We have bear claws. I don't know if we have
any Nicodranas bear claws?"

01:04:00.414 --> 01:04:02.058
LIAM: We'll take the bear claws, yeah?

01:04:02.058 --> 01:04:04.542
LAURA: Yes, and then we can compare and let you
know.

01:04:04.542 --> 01:04:08.779
MATT: "As far as I know the only major difference
is they load it up with cinnamon--"

01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:12.579
LAURA: That's exactly what I was going to say!
Cinnamon, yes!

01:04:12.579 --> 01:04:16.597
MATT: "We can do that. That'll be done. How many
would you like?"

01:04:16.597 --> 01:04:20.589
LIAM: Probably ten bear claws. Also do you have
any hot freshly baked bread?

01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:23.121
MATT: "That we do as well. Of course."

01:04:23.121 --> 01:04:28.359
LIAM: I will take a large loaf of hot bread, fresh
out of the oven, please.

01:04:28.359 --> 01:04:33.704
MATT: "Yeah, you'll have to wait the moment. About
20, 25 minutes, we'll have a fresh one for you."

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:35.769
MARISHA: Maybe we can go shopping and come back?

01:04:35.769 --> 01:04:41.198
LIAM: Yeah, we'll return. We'll double back for
the bear claws. So we'll come back for ten of

01:04:41.198 --> 01:04:43.413
these and that hot bread.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:46.163
MATT: "So ten bear claws and bread. You want to
pay in advance?"

01:04:46.163 --> 01:04:48.558
LIAM: Yeah, sure, that's no problem. What do I
need?

01:04:48.558 --> 01:04:50.595
MATT: So for all the bear claws and the loaf of
bread--

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:51.646
LAURA: I don't know.

01:04:51.646 --> 01:04:52.870
MATT: Yeah, it's not that much.

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:54.436
LIAM: $13.50?

01:04:54.436 --> 01:04:58.367
MATT: Probably run you three silver.

01:04:58.367 --> 01:05:05.954
LIAM: Okay. One. Two. Three. Easy. Thank you very
much.

01:05:05.954 --> 01:05:11.151
MATT: Of course. See you back here in a minute. As
soon as you turn around, somebody else has pushed

01:05:11.151 --> 01:05:15.804
past you and gotten in the front. "I'd like three
of--" and you're like, ugh, this place is awful.

01:05:15.804 --> 01:05:17.920
LIAM: Come on, it's too crowded in there.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.209
LAURA: Caleb, I'll buy you some porn.

01:05:20.209 --> 01:05:26.377
LIAM: Okay, that's good to know. I lead the way to
Chastity's Nook.

01:05:26.377 --> 01:05:32.321
MATT: As you enter the small shop, the interior is
beautiful and surprisingly busy. There's five

01:05:32.321 --> 01:05:40.312
other patrons that are currently perusing through
various tomes and stacks of artwork. You can see

01:05:40.312 --> 01:05:46.458
it carries many books and different types of
tawdry decor, like rugs, embroidered tapestries,

01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:51.689
candles, both scented and not, and you can smell
oils and incense in there as well. It's this

01:05:51.689 --> 01:05:57.983
mishmash of scents. It's dark-lit in the interior,
but as soon as you enter, almost every other

01:05:57.983 --> 01:06:05.374
person glances over their shoulder at you and goes
back about their business. As soon as you finish

01:06:05.374 --> 01:06:14.333
scanning the room, a voice peeks up and goes,
"Hello!" You glance over and see a human female in

01:06:14.333 --> 01:06:21.528
her 40s, mousey brown hair, wild and curly that
goes past her shoulders, and she has a heavy

01:06:21.528 --> 01:06:26.684
sweater on and these big glasses right in front of
her face. She goes, "Can I help you?"

01:06:26.684 --> 01:06:30.040
LIAM: That is a very handsome sweater you have. Is
that from here in the city?

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.773
MATT: "Thank you so much. It was a gift."

01:06:32.773 --> 01:06:37.995
LIAM: I'm sorry, what is your name?

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:38.974
MATT: "Iva."

01:06:38.974 --> 01:06:40.258
LIAM: Iva. Pleasure to meet you.

01:06:40.258 --> 01:06:43.311
MATT: "Iva Deshin and this is my shop."

01:06:43.311 --> 01:06:53.182
LIAM: Iva Deshin. I'm new to town, and I'm looking
for a bit of reading, and this place has been

01:06:53.182 --> 01:06:56.104
highly recommended to me, and I'm wondering
what--

01:06:56.104 --> 01:07:03.897
MATT: A grin curls past her face. She goes,
"Recommended? You want to go to that back." She

01:07:03.897 --> 01:07:09.751
points, and you can see now that she's pointed
out, because it's one long chamber with shelves

01:07:09.751 --> 01:07:14.484
and a central table. The beginning has more of the
accouterments, like the candles and the various

01:07:14.484 --> 01:07:18.507
knickknacks you can purchase. In the back, you can
already see there are large scrolls that are hung

01:07:18.507 --> 01:07:23.893
up, with beautifully painted nudes. You can see
rows and rows of--

01:07:23.893 --> 01:07:26.773
(laughing)

01:07:26.773 --> 01:07:28.568
LIAM: I made you plan for this!

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:38.657
MATT: I know you did. Yeah, you did, buddy. There
are stacks of books where the covers have their

01:07:38.657 --> 01:07:41.140
own individual paintings, where you can see--

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:44.273
TRAVIS: Yep. Detail!

01:07:44.273 --> 01:07:53.390
MATT: You can see a portion of a moonlight
painting of a brawny-looking man who's dipping a

01:07:53.390 --> 01:08:02.071
fainting woman in a delicate dress, glistening
across the moonlight. It's slightly pulled open,

01:08:02.071 --> 01:08:10.001
yeah. This is the young adult romance section of
any bookstore on full display, and the more you

01:08:10.001 --> 01:08:14.425
look back, you can see there's a few figures in
the process of thumbing through the books, reading

01:08:14.425 --> 01:08:21.944
them where they stand in the middle there. "Are
you looking for anything in particular?"

01:08:21.944 --> 01:08:28.971
LIAM: You know, my tastes are very varied. I'm
always looking for something new.

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:30.863
MATT: "Ooh, I have recommendations, if you like."

01:08:30.863 --> 01:08:33.457
LIAM: Of course. I am very interested in
literature recommendations.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:38.860
MATT: "There's Zemnian Nights. Very popular.
There's The Enchanting Tryst, for those who want

01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:45.810
more of a fantastical perspective. Scent of the
Sea, for the traveler who enjoys their perusal.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:52.826
That one is outer empire, so folks have varying
interest. There's Tusk Love. That one's a little

01:08:52.826 --> 01:08:54.124
more saucy."

01:08:54.124 --> 01:08:55.863
ALL: Tusk Love!

01:08:55.863 --> 01:08:59.563
(laughter)

01:08:59.563 --> 01:09:04.652
MATT: "If you want something more gentle,
something that's more of a classic love story, we

01:09:04.815 --> 01:09:09.120
have Guard of My Heart. Shallow Breaths are a bit
more bawdy."

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.748
LAURA: I want to buy Tusk Love, please.

01:09:11.748 --> 01:09:14.357
MATT: "Right this way."

01:09:14.357 --> 01:09:19.114
LIAM: As she walks away from us: You know, I'm
obviously here for a purpose, but I like

01:09:19.114 --> 01:09:25.270
historical fiction as well, and I like when the
two things are combined. Do you know what I mean?

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:27.631
LAURA: Sex and history.

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:39.218
MATT: She leans in for a moment and gives you a
look. "Follow me." She leads you both to the back.

01:09:39.218 --> 01:09:42.378
She plucks a copy of Tusk Love.

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:45.416
SAM: There's a guy in an Abraham Lincoln costume,
just whacking it.

01:09:45.416 --> 01:09:50.033
(laughter)

01:09:51.975 --> 01:09:53.596
MARISHA: I'm following, by the way.

01:09:53.596 --> 01:09:55.425
TRAVIS: Four score--

01:10:01.275 --> 01:10:05.670
MATT: "Define 'historical.' What are your
interests?"

01:10:05.757 --> 01:10:13.260
LIAM: I like historical fiction. I don't like
shallow smut. I like to learn something while I'm

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:17.082
being titillated, I suppose.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:19.554
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:10:19.554 --> 01:10:22.320
TRAVIS: My shirt's gone back up.

01:10:22.422 --> 01:10:25.422
(laughter)

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:28.291
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:10:29.502 --> 01:10:32.003
MATT: You made me do this, Liam.

01:10:32.003 --> 01:10:34.858
LAURA: I love how many book titles you have.

01:10:34.858 --> 01:10:37.449
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Edubation.

01:10:38.699 --> 01:10:40.547
MATT: Edubation?!

01:10:41.939 --> 01:10:45.608
TRAVIS: (straining) A squared plus B squared
equals C squared!

01:10:48.947 --> 01:10:51.341
LIAM: I have rolled a <i>zwanzig,</i> that is twenty.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:11:02.242
MATT: Okay. "It's been banned for the past 15
years, but I do have a couple of reclaimed copies

01:11:02.242 --> 01:11:05.716
of Courting of the Crick, if you'd be
interested."

01:11:05.716 --> 01:11:07.831
SAM: Courting of the Crick.

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:12.244
LIAM: I'm very much interested, in this and other
books as well, but we will start with (whispers)

01:11:12.244 --> 01:11:13.961
the Courting of the Crick.

01:11:13.961 --> 01:11:20.732
MATT: "Well, because it's--" and the voice stays
very hushed, and she adjusts her glasses, the

01:11:20.732 --> 01:11:26.642
closer she gets "--because it is technically not
supposed to be here, it's a bit pricier. That one

01:11:26.642 --> 01:11:30.093
runs you about 15 gold pieces."

01:11:30.093 --> 01:11:34.869
LIAM: I'm still interested. I would like to see
the quality of the book. You know, see if it's in

01:11:34.869 --> 01:11:37.684
mint condition.

01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:48.464
MATT: "Of course, it's not a worry. Just a
moment." The other books, the regular books--

01:11:48.464 --> 01:11:50.334
LIAM: Did she walk away from me, by the way?

01:11:50.334 --> 01:11:51.189
MATT: Briefly, yeah.

01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:52.765
LIAM: I cast Detect Magic.

01:11:52.765 --> 01:11:54.165
MATT: Okay.

01:11:54.165 --> 01:11:56.412
LAURA: On her? On the room?

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:58.133
LIAM: Everything.

01:11:58.133 --> 01:12:05.961
MATT: As you complete your incantation, there is a
slight shimmer of energy that expands around the

01:12:05.961 --> 01:12:12.901
chamber, and scanning through and across the
books, nothing peeks out at you as magical from

01:12:12.901 --> 01:12:18.533
the shelves. It looks there's only a collection of
tomes. You get a small blip from the hunched,

01:12:18.533 --> 01:12:23.637
cloaked figure in the corner that's currently
reading through one of the books hurriedly. Just a

01:12:23.637 --> 01:12:26.977
faint source of magic on their person.

01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:38.878
LIAM: The range, I believe, is 30 feet, if I'm not
mistaken. Yeah, it is. Am I covering every part of

01:12:38.878 --> 01:12:41.801
the store where I am? I start to browse.

01:12:43.864 --> 01:12:46.197
MATT: Okay. I will say-- let me look at the--

01:12:47.017 --> 01:12:49.146
If anything looks out of reach of the spell

01:12:49.146 --> 01:12:51.660
that I have just cast,
I will walk in that direction.

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:59.304
MATT: Right. It's concentration, so you can pass
around. You scan the entirety of the room. It does

01:12:59.304 --> 01:13:06.099
not appear to be that there is anything directly
magical being put on any of the shelves.

01:13:06.099 --> 01:13:09.282
MARISHA: It's because this whole place is magical,
Caleb.

01:13:09.282 --> 01:13:12.476
TRAVIS: Angels and demons.

01:13:13.143 --> 01:13:17.204
MATT: The only blip of magic source you're getting
is from one of the patrons.

01:13:17.204 --> 01:13:22.130
LIAM: Just one of the patrons. Nothing behind any
doors, nothing on the shelves. Okay, I wait for

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:23.363
her to return.

01:13:23.363 --> 01:13:27.763
MARISHA: Does there appear to be a used book
section, like trade-ins?

01:13:27.763 --> 01:13:34.629
MATT: Unfortunately, no. There isn't a lot of
business for used books here in the Tri-Spires.

01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:39.817
Most folks purchase and display on their shelves.
It's a symbol of status. The more books you have,

01:13:39.817 --> 01:13:44.000
the more you can display on your shelves, the more
well-read you are to your guests, as you have them

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.058
over. There isn't a big market for returning
things you've read.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:54.707
MARISHA: Huh. Okay. You can learn a lot from what
people wrote in books.

01:13:54.707 --> 01:13:59.460
LAURA: I walk up to one of the other patrons
that's hurriedly looking through one of the books.

01:13:59.546 --> 01:14:01.775
MATT: Okay. The one that's closest to you, or one
of the other ones?

01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:04.337
LAURA: Sure. Whatever one is closest to me.

01:14:04.337 --> 01:14:09.168
MATT: The one that's closest to you, as you
approach from behind, he has a dark brown cloak

01:14:09.168 --> 01:14:17.410
that's pulled over one shoulder. He's wearing a
sky blue tunic, soft, a silk sheen to it in what

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:22.511
little bit of lantern light is lighting the
interior. From the side of his chin, you can see

01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:28.216
he's got a softer, rounder face, and as soon as
you begin to approach, as you aren't approaching

01:14:28.216 --> 01:14:37.041
quietly, he stops, the book closes, back on the
shelf. Make a perception check.

01:14:42.402 --> 01:14:47.574
LAURA: Oh no. Perception? 18.

01:14:47.574 --> 01:14:50.452
MATT: It is Shallow Breaths.

01:14:51.632 --> 01:14:53.288
TRAVIS: Breasts, or breaths?

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.225
MATT: Breaths.

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:56.643
TALIESIN: Heaving.

01:14:56.643 --> 01:14:58.420
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Heaving breasts.

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.327
TRAVIS: (breathes deeply)

01:15:02.354 --> 01:15:05.717
LAURA: Ooh, Shallow Breaths, that's a good one.

01:15:05.717 --> 01:15:14.455
MATT: As the guy turns around, you can see him.
He's mid to late thirties, you would expect, dark

01:15:14.455 --> 01:15:21.145
hair slicked back, the hairline pulling back a
bit, male pattern baldness-style, human, and as

01:15:21.145 --> 01:15:25.786
soon he whips around: "Oh, I'm just perusing."

01:15:25.786 --> 01:15:27.896
LAURA: It's not one of your favorites?

01:15:27.896 --> 01:15:30.728
MATT: "I don't know, I've not read it, I couldn't
tell you."

01:15:32.678 --> 01:15:33.998
LAURA: What's your name?

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.742
MATT: "I need to go."

01:15:36.883 --> 01:15:41.292
He pushes past you, and as
he begins to exit the chamber, he goes, "I'm all

01:15:41.292 --> 01:15:45.593
right, I'm good, thank you this time, good bye,"
and darts out into the rain.

01:15:45.593 --> 01:15:48.337
LAURA: I open it up and see what Shallow Breaths
is about.

01:15:48.337 --> 01:15:59.311
MATT: It is smutty. We're talking like, Anne Rice
fairy tale book-level.

01:15:59.311 --> 01:16:05.598
TALIESIN: Good skirt around there, by the way.
Well done.

01:16:05.676 --> 01:16:08.325
MATT: I remember I got really --

01:16:08.325 --> 01:16:10.398
TALIESIN: We were all in high school once, it's okay.

01:16:10.398 --> 01:16:12.719
MATT: No, I got really into Interview with a
Vampire, and then my mom got these great new Anne

01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:24.243
Rice books, and I was like, "Oh, she made new
books about Cinderella, that's-- oh." Yeah. It's

01:16:24.243 --> 01:16:28.433
what you'd expect.

01:16:28.433 --> 01:16:29.819
LAURA: Smutty.

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:33.805
MARISHA: Hey, Jester. Do you think that the fact
that this place is called, "Chastity's Nook" gives

01:16:33.805 --> 01:16:35.983
everyone a complex who shops here?

01:16:35.983 --> 01:16:36.917
LAURA: Yes.

01:16:36.917 --> 01:16:37.799
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:16:37.799 --> 01:16:39.225
LAURA: It's really good.

01:16:39.225 --> 01:16:47.493
MATT: At this point, Iva returns with a book-sized
tome that is covered in a soft deerskin leather,

01:16:47.493 --> 01:16:52.986
pulls it open, and shows you the outside of it.
It's very high quality, like it's barely been

01:16:52.986 --> 01:16:57.392
read. "This is the piece."

01:16:57.392 --> 01:17:00.312
LIAM: That is finely made. May I hold it?

01:17:00.312 --> 01:17:05.601
MATT: "You may." She looks over to make sure
they're blocking the view to anybody else.

01:17:05.601 --> 01:17:08.946
LIAM: I turn with her, so that my back is, and I
speed read four pages.

01:17:08.946 --> 01:17:11.012
LAURA: Are there illustrations?

01:17:11.012 --> 01:17:14.167
LIAM: Oh jeez!

01:17:14.167 --> 01:17:19.626
MATT: Interestingly enough, it begins almost like
The Silmarillion, in the sense that it reads not

01:17:19.626 --> 01:17:21.050
very flowery.

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:23.639
TRAVIS: In a hole in the ground.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:33.528
MATT: It has a very instructional, nonfiction,
historical-type speech. It begins to talk of early

01:17:33.528 --> 01:17:40.062
empirical conflicts. It begins to talk of the
post-Calamity.

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:47.566
It begins to talk of elements of--
It begins to hint at the ideas of

01:17:47.566 --> 01:17:55.252
forbidden romance between sides that were not
meant to meet. A lot of it begins like, "and then

01:17:55.252 --> 01:17:59.560
this person led this army into this place, and
these many were slaughtered."

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:03.893
LIAM: Out of curiosity, if I flip through, do I
see any boning anywhere inside?

01:18:03.893 --> 01:18:10.097
MATT: As you begin to flip through, she
(chuckles), "I understand if that was enough of a

01:18:10.097 --> 01:18:13.089
peek and you're interested, you could purchase?"

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:18.639
LIAM: Yes, it's a high quality item, you can
understand my excitement. I've been thinking in

01:18:18.639 --> 01:18:24.139
the space of time that you have left, and while I
would like to purchase something here today, I'm

01:18:24.139 --> 01:18:29.592
very low on funds, and the nature of this book,
and the trouble I could get into-- I mean, your

01:18:29.592 --> 01:18:34.630
secret is safe with me, but it is too hot for my
hands. I was wondering if you had a copy of

01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:36.832
Shallow Breaths here?

01:18:36.832 --> 01:18:42.819
MATT: "That I do. And not a worry." She quickly
folds it up and tucks it under her arm and hides

01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:47.834
it amongst her sweater. Right over here. She picks
up a copy, the same copy the gentleman was looking

01:18:47.834 --> 01:18:49.538
through earlier, and hands it to you.

01:18:49.538 --> 01:18:50.982
LIAM: Perfect. How much would this run me?

01:18:50.982 --> 01:18:52.224
MATT: "Three silver pieces."

01:18:52.224 --> 01:18:56.295
LIAM: Three silver, okay. I take out the three
silver. One, two, three, and I hand it over.

01:18:56.295 --> 01:18:58.315
MATT: "Thank you very much."

01:18:58.315 --> 01:19:00.780
LIAM: Yes, and did you two want to get anything?

01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:03.499
LAURA: Yes, I want to buy the Tusky Love one.

01:19:03.499 --> 01:19:06.187
MATT: "That is also three silver pieces."

01:19:06.187 --> 01:19:10.467
LAURA: (whispers) And I want to buy the other one
that's expensive, please, thank you.

01:19:10.467 --> 01:19:12.907
MARISHA: (whispers) Aw, you beat me to it.

01:19:12.907 --> 01:19:14.337
LAURA: (whispers) Yeah.

01:19:14.337 --> 01:19:16.242
MATT: (whispers) "All right, that's 15 gold."

01:19:16.242 --> 01:19:18.572
LAURA: But be secret when you put it in my bag,
okay?

01:19:18.572 --> 01:19:19.710
MATT: "Okay."

01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:20.950
SAM: Paper bag.

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:25.691
(laughter)

01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:37.342
MATT: Very terrible discreet hand-off, where it's
like-- She adjusts her glasses once more. "Thank

01:19:37.342 --> 01:19:44.283
you, and it's been a pleasure. If you're ever
interested, I do my own writing, and am in the

01:19:44.283 --> 01:19:47.961
process of finishing the third chapter of my next
series, so--"

01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:50.756
MARISHA: I would love to see it right now.

01:19:50.756 --> 01:19:52.740
MATT: "Well, it's not done."

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.305
MARISHA: Do you have a sample?

01:19:54.305 --> 01:19:56.040
LIAM: What is your niche?

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:03.492
MATT: "Well," She gets a little nervous, reaches
behind, pulls out a small piece of paper, and

01:20:03.492 --> 01:20:09.134
says, "I need this back because it's part of my
manuscript. You can have a glance over it."

01:20:09.134 --> 01:20:11.622
TRAVIS: Tumblr is so happy right now.

01:20:11.622 --> 01:20:13.179
MARISHA: What is it?

01:20:13.179 --> 01:20:20.233
MATT: At a quick glance, it is not very well
written. It's a bit ham-fisted in its analogies

01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:37.983
and descriptives. You have caught the middle of a
saucy meeting of a strong, strapping farmhand, who

01:20:37.983 --> 01:20:47.873
is currently trying to work down the cost of a
piece of equipment by the purveyor. You don't have

01:20:47.873 --> 01:20:53.836
enough information to make out the full story, but
it's this, "How can I get this at a cheaper price?"

01:20:53.921 --> 01:20:56.834
MARISHA: She's very heavy-handed with her
innuendos.

01:20:56.834 --> 01:21:05.233
MATT: The salesman's like, "Well, I don't know.
How much are you willing to pay?" It goes back and

01:21:05.233 --> 01:21:09.214
forth, and you're like, I see where this is going,
but it's not going there fast enough.

01:21:09.214 --> 01:21:16.016
MARISHA: They keep talking about the heft of his
equipment. A <i>lot</i> of reference to his equipment.

01:21:16.016 --> 01:21:17.908
TRAVIS: The gauge of his pipe?

01:21:17.908 --> 01:21:20.857
MARISHA: Yeah, it's-- Do you--?

01:21:20.857 --> 01:21:22.782
MATT: "Do you like it?"

01:21:26.772 --> 01:21:28.375
MARISHA: Oh, do I.

01:21:29.055 --> 01:21:30.382
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:21:30.382 --> 01:21:34.932
MARISHA: Fuck! I was thinking of Fjord as I was
trying to be nice!

01:21:35.033 --> 01:21:37.090
TRAVIS: Yeah, you were doing it.

01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:38.924
LIAM: All her hopes and dreams.

01:21:38.924 --> 01:21:46.531
MARISHA: It's cocked, right? Okay, thank you. 18.

01:21:46.531 --> 01:21:49.547
MATT: She's like, "Oh good! I'm so glad you like
it."

01:21:49.547 --> 01:21:56.135
MARISHA: You know, there seems to be a lot of
machinery knowledge and, like, heavy machinery

01:21:56.135 --> 01:21:59.449
knowledge. Was that also an interest of yours?

01:21:59.449 --> 01:22:02.736
MATT: "Oh, well there was a family background,
yes. Before I took up writing."

01:22:02.736 --> 01:22:08.920
MARISHA: Man, I've never seen engineering and--
combined!

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:13.148
MATT: "I think it's rare that I meet people that
are interested in seeing that type of niche. Thank

01:22:13.148 --> 01:22:19.396
you. I hope to have it ready for sale, hopefully
within the next three or four months, so please do

01:22:19.396 --> 01:22:20.684
come by again."

01:22:20.684 --> 01:22:22.869
MARISHA: Consider me interested.

01:22:22.869 --> 01:22:24.114
MATT: "Thank you."

01:22:25.164 --> 01:22:26.766
TRAVIS: Is there a mailing list?

01:22:27.028 --> 01:22:34.029
MARISHA: Yeah, I almost asked if there was. Is
there a mailing list? You got to get the word out.

01:22:34.029 --> 01:22:35.998
Get people interested.

01:22:35.998 --> 01:22:41.714
MATT: "It's kind of a word of mouth thing. The
clientele prefer a bit of privacy."

01:22:41.714 --> 01:22:43.264
MARISHA: Sure!

01:22:43.264 --> 01:22:46.418
LAURA: While this was going on, and she was
distracted.

01:22:46.418 --> 01:22:48.220
MATT: Oh no.

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:55.418
LAURA: Can I find one of the books that looks
easily accessible? I want to open it up and on the

01:22:55.418 --> 01:23:05.063
inside write: "We're watching you. We saw you come
in here."

01:23:06.361 --> 01:23:14.266
MATT: You grab a quick copy of Guard of My Heart.
The cover has the actual Crownsguard crest printed

01:23:14.266 --> 01:23:24.474
on it. It is a dynamic of honor versus what the
heart wants. Make a sleight of hand check.

01:23:24.889 --> 01:23:27.076
LIAM: Written by Seven Corbo.

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:34.131
LAURA: That's so good! Plus five, so what is that?
23? 23.

01:23:34.131 --> 01:23:39.780
MATT: As you quickly whip through the statement,
close the book, set it on the shelf, no one any

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:45.956
the wiser. You have a sense of accomplishment wash
over you. You hear this faint, distant chuckle

01:23:45.956 --> 01:23:49.007
that is sourceless, but pleased.

01:23:49.007 --> 01:23:51.194
LAURA: That felt good.

01:23:51.194 --> 01:23:56.908
MATT: You have your smut. What would you like to
do now?

01:23:56.908 --> 01:23:58.897
LIAM: It's probably about time to go pick up the
bear claws.

01:23:58.897 --> 01:24:00.337
LAURA: The pastries!

01:24:00.337 --> 01:24:07.957
MATT: Easily enough. It's still raining, but not
quite the heavy drizzle it was earlier. It's

01:24:07.957 --> 01:24:11.657
lighting up a little bit. As soon as you step
outside, you can see, way far off in the distance,

01:24:11.657 --> 01:24:15.888
a little bit of blue begin to break. The heavy
part of the stormfront, at least, is beginning to

01:24:15.888 --> 01:24:22.700
pass. You pick up the remainder of your ordered
baked goods and a loaf of bread as well.

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:28.947
LIAM: On the top shelf, behind you there. What do
you call those? These pastries? I slide the smut

01:24:28.947 --> 01:24:32.700
under a tray of bread.

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.143
MATT: You slide it under a what?

01:24:34.143 --> 01:24:35.504
LIAM: A tray of bread on the counter.

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:36.541
MATT: Just on the counter?

01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:37.536
LIAM: Yeah. Hide it.

01:24:37.536 --> 01:24:39.655
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

01:24:40.218 --> 01:24:41.720
LIAM: They look the other way.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.258
SAM: You learn from the best.

01:24:43.258 --> 01:24:48.146
LIAM: That's all right. 11.

01:24:48.146 --> 01:24:53.808
MATT: 11, okay. He glances up, "Oh, that's more
bread."

01:24:53.808 --> 01:24:58.997
LIAM: Oh. Okay. I'll take my bread, please.

01:24:58.997 --> 01:25:02.250
MATT: "Yes, of course. Fresh. Here you are, sir!"

01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:04.803
LIAM: Thank you. Would you like to carry the bear
claws?

01:25:04.803 --> 01:25:09.045
LAURA: Yes please! Thank you.

01:25:09.045 --> 01:25:14.764
LIAM: As we're walking out, I will show you a
trick that I've learned in the past few years.

01:25:14.764 --> 01:25:20.258
It's very cold out. I pull sides of the bread out.
It's hot. I hand to you a bread, and I hand you a

01:25:20.258 --> 01:25:25.966
piece of bread, and then I shove my hands in. It's
warm, and I can eat it later! Let's go.

01:25:25.966 --> 01:25:28.326
MARISHA: Oh, Caleb.

01:25:28.326 --> 01:25:31.368
LAURA: You know you can buy mittens?

01:25:31.368 --> 01:25:34.351
MARISHA: Yeah, there are muffs? Like hand muffs?

01:25:34.351 --> 01:25:39.229
LIAM: Yeah, but I can eat this. Why are you
looking at me that way?

01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:41.298
LAURA: It's weird, Caleb. It's weird.

01:25:41.298 --> 01:25:45.634
LIAM: It's not weird. Many people have done this
in this make-believe world and also in America.

01:25:45.634 --> 01:25:48.524
MARISHA: (skeptical noise)

01:25:48.524 --> 01:25:50.127
LIAM: I walk out the door.

01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:52.340
LAURA: Well, it's really good bread.

01:25:53.389 --> 01:25:55.734
MATT: Any other business you'd like to tend to
while you're in the Tri-Spire, or are you joining

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:56.919
your friends?

01:25:56.919 --> 01:25:58.695
LAURA: I think there's a casino here.

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:00.754
SAM: Jesus!

01:26:00.754 --> 01:26:03.523
LAURA: But, we can just go to the Pillow Trove.

01:26:03.523 --> 01:26:05.505
SAM: (loud whispering) Do you want to drop off
that key first?

01:26:05.505 --> 01:26:06.627
LAURA: That's why I'm going to the Pillow Trove!

01:26:06.627 --> 01:26:08.581
SAM: Oh okay. Yeah.

01:26:08.581 --> 01:26:11.029
LAURA: I heard Nott telling me something.

01:26:11.029 --> 01:26:13.245
SAM: I am the Traveler.

01:26:13.245 --> 01:26:19.396
TALIESIN: I thought were going to go for Mighty
Nein sponsorship at the Nook.

01:26:19.396 --> 01:26:24.265
MARISHA: As we walk along to the Pillow Trove,
when we walk by the flowery bushes, I slowly pop

01:26:24.265 --> 01:26:27.811
all the blossoms off the flowers as I go.

01:26:27.811 --> 01:26:35.252
MATT: As you guys make your way to the interior of
the Pillow Trove, the same woman clerk, who you

01:26:35.252 --> 01:26:41.377
met the other day, is there in the process of
going through and organizing the last bit of

01:26:41.377 --> 01:26:48.566
information of the few folks that got rooms the
night before. You see at the top of the split

01:26:48.566 --> 01:26:58.016
staircase a female elf: brunette with golden eyes,
older in the face. You see some lines along the

01:26:58.016 --> 01:27:07.282
cheeks that-- for elves, that age gracefully--
shows a bit of age. You see a very beautiful,

01:27:07.282 --> 01:27:12.376
laced, red dress that goes up to the neck, with a
bit of a window right there. The arms are crossed

01:27:12.376 --> 01:27:19.815
and folded in front, and as you enter, looks down
and smiles. The clerk glances up, "Oh, hello again."

01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:23.147
LAURA: She's beautiful. Who's that?

01:27:23.261 --> 01:27:30.208
MATT: "That's Madam Luenna. Madame?" and the woman
descends the stairs, one step at a time, arms

01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:35.148
crossed. "Hello. Pleasure to make your
acquaintance."

01:27:35.148 --> 01:27:36.649
LAURA: You too.

01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:38.751
MATT: "Can I help you?"

01:27:38.751 --> 01:27:43.162
LAURA: I don't know. I just asked who you were
because you're really pretty.

01:27:43.162 --> 01:27:45.695
MATT: "I am the owner of the Pillow Trove."

01:27:45.695 --> 01:27:50.907
LAURA: Oh! It's beautiful! You did a really good
job in here decorating.

01:27:50.907 --> 01:27:54.454
MATT: "Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate
it."

01:27:54.454 --> 01:27:56.684
LAURA: Your dress is really pretty, too.

01:27:56.684 --> 01:28:01.847
MATT: "Thank you kindly. So?"

01:28:01.847 --> 01:28:05.871
LAURA: I came to get all my stuff out of my room
and then I'm going to give the key back, okay?

01:28:05.871 --> 01:28:07.824
MATT: "You're checking out? How unfortunate."

01:28:07.824 --> 01:28:14.481
LAURA: I am, but I'll be back very soon because I
have a package coming. So be on the lookout for

01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:16.081
one to Jester.

01:28:16.081 --> 01:28:17.595
MATT: "Jester. Is that your name?"

01:28:17.595 --> 01:28:18.942
LAURA: That is me.

01:28:18.942 --> 01:28:26.610
MATT: She takes your hand and holds it. "A
pleasure, my dear. Good bye."

01:28:26.610 --> 01:28:28.096
LAURA: Good bye.

01:28:28.096 --> 01:28:30.177
MATT: Turns and makes her way back up the stairs.

01:28:30.177 --> 01:28:32.565
LAURA and MARISHA: She's really pretty.

01:28:32.565 --> 01:28:34.313
LAURA: Did you see her eyes? They were golden.

01:28:34.313 --> 01:28:35.172
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:28:35.172 --> 01:28:36.347
LAURA: You want to see my room?

01:28:36.347 --> 01:28:38.379
MARISHA: Sure!

01:28:39.339 --> 01:28:40.956
TRAVIS: Want to see my toys?

01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:51.197
MATT: You walk upstairs, you find the room. It's
small, the one that you had rented, but it's

01:28:51.197 --> 01:29:00.248
beautiful in the interior. The sheets have layered
lace. High thread count. It's quite awesome. There

01:29:00.248 --> 01:29:05.747
is a balcony, though the curtain's currently drawn
because of the rainy day outside. It's a very nice

01:29:05.747 --> 01:29:06.692
room.

01:29:06.692 --> 01:29:10.011
LIAM: I slide my hand under the sheets, and I feel
that thread count.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.949
MARISHA: Your hands are dirty! You're covered in
bread!

01:29:11.949 --> 01:29:15.341
LAURA: No! It's okay because I rented it! I pull
the covers off.

01:29:15.341 --> 01:29:16.310
MARISHA: Oh, that's right!

01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:19.532
LAURA: Lay down! You want to lay down! You can use
it!

01:29:19.532 --> 01:29:22.906
LIAM: Maybe if you had carried a ruler, you could
hit my knuckles harder next time.

01:29:22.906 --> 01:29:24.159
MARISHA: Would you like that?

01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:25.160
LIAM: No.

01:29:27.231 --> 01:29:29.127
MARISHA: Would you like some mitts?

01:29:29.127 --> 01:29:30.204
LIAM: No!

01:29:30.204 --> 01:29:32.366
MARISHA: You know this is how diseases are spread,
right?

01:29:32.366 --> 01:29:34.311
LIAM: I light my hand on fire.

01:29:34.628 --> 01:29:35.651
MARISHA: Okay.

01:29:37.147 --> 01:29:40.283
LAURA: Why didn't you just light your hands on
fire instead of putting it in bread?

01:29:40.283 --> 01:29:43.092
LIAM: I would've burned the bread and then I
couldn't eat it. It's simple.

01:29:43.092 --> 01:29:45.453
LAURA: It's toast. It's actually really tasty.

01:29:45.453 --> 01:29:48.781
LIAM: Well, I don't have-- the control is a little
tricky sometimes.

01:29:48.781 --> 01:29:49.782
LAURA: Little off.

01:29:49.782 --> 01:29:51.790
LIAM: Sometimes.

01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:53.578
LAURA: Open the curtains up!

01:29:53.578 --> 01:29:56.348
MARISHA: Did we get a good view?

01:29:56.348 --> 01:30:02.113
MATT: You get a decent view. It's not terribly
high up, but you get to look down over the street

01:30:02.113 --> 01:30:07.521
below you, the cobblestones still slick and the
rain pattering on the stonework. You see the

01:30:07.521 --> 01:30:13.425
fences that curl around the exterior of the
terrace. The treetops are now more visible and the

01:30:13.425 --> 01:30:19.587
canopy is puffing up behind the larger estates and
buildings that make up the interior of the

01:30:19.587 --> 01:30:26.146
Tri-Spires. You have a pretty decent view of the
Zauber Spire from here. You see it domes towards

01:30:26.146 --> 01:30:35.866
the very peak. There is a glass, cylindrical, top
floor that overlooks the entirety of the city.

01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:38.668
Make a perception check.

01:30:38.668 --> 01:30:39.837
MARISHA: Okay.

01:30:43.334 --> 01:30:49.468
Natural 19. Plus three so 22.

01:30:49.468 --> 01:30:53.455
MATT: Not too difficult for you to see, even
through the bit of rain that's up there, but at

01:30:53.455 --> 01:30:57.444
the very top where you see the glass exterior, you
see the outline of two figures that are standing,

01:30:57.444 --> 01:30:59.757
looking over the entire city from up there.

01:30:59.757 --> 01:31:01.139
MARISHA: At the top of the Zauber Spire?

01:31:01.139 --> 01:31:02.102
MATT: Yeah, Zauber Spire.

01:31:02.102 --> 01:31:05.092
LIAM: Zauber. Like sour.

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:11.110
MARISHA: What do they look like? Are they wearing
any colors?

01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:14.220
MATT: You can't make out the full details of them
from this distance, but you can see the basic

01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.164
shape and outline of two figures looking out.

01:31:17.164 --> 01:31:19.757
LAURA: I'm dancing around the room while you're
looking.

01:31:19.757 --> 01:31:21.378
MATT: Jester's just darting around.

01:31:21.378 --> 01:31:23.723
LAURA: Literally dancing around.

01:31:23.723 --> 01:31:26.030
LIAM: What are you looking at? You're squinting.

01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:28.347
MARISHA: Just looking. Just, you know, people
watching.

01:31:28.347 --> 01:31:29.898
LIAM: Where are there people?

01:31:29.898 --> 01:31:34.614
MARISHA: These two assholes up there on the top of
the Zauber Spire.

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:40.266
LIAM, MARISHA, and LAURA: Zauber.

01:31:40.266 --> 01:31:43.277
LAURA: I crawl under the bed.

01:31:43.277 --> 01:31:51.263
MARISHA: Hey, the whole Cerberus Assembly thing.
Do you know much about them?

01:31:51.263 --> 01:31:55.420
LIAM: I mean, if you are in the empire you've
heard of the Cerberus Assembly, <i>ja</i>.

01:31:55.420 --> 01:32:02.772
MARISHA: Yeah, no. I know. We're both empire kids,
right? More so than the rest of the Nein?

01:32:04.296 --> 01:32:05.210
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

01:32:06.347 --> 01:32:12.343
MARISHA: What do you think about the empire? 
About the crown?

01:32:12.343 --> 01:32:14.668
LIAM: It is what it is.

01:32:14.668 --> 01:32:18.041
MARISHA: Okay. I think it's kind of bullshitty.

01:32:18.041 --> 01:32:23.998
LIAM: Well, that is also true, but it also is what
it is. It's the empire.

01:32:23.998 --> 01:32:26.565
LAURA: What makes it bullshitty?

01:32:26.565 --> 01:32:28.826
MATT: You hear Jester say from underneath the
bed.

01:32:28.826 --> 01:32:32.098
LIAM: Where are you? What are you doing down
there?

01:32:32.098 --> 01:32:34.975
LAURA: I was seeing if anybody left anything good
under here.

01:32:34.975 --> 01:32:36.628
LIAM: And?

01:32:36.628 --> 01:32:40.006
LAURA: Did anybody leave anything good under the
bed?

01:32:40.006 --> 01:32:43.013
MATT: No. Actually, it's pretty well-cleaned and
maintained underneath there.

01:32:43.013 --> 01:32:49.141
LAURA: It's pretty well-cleaned though, so nothing
is here that's good. Not even any bugs or anything.

01:32:50.876 --> 01:32:57.492
MARISHA: I don't know, look at this. Look at how
much money is up here compared to elsewhere. This

01:32:57.492 --> 01:32:58.980
is a lot of control.

01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:01.391
LIAM: Yeah. What are you going to do about it?

01:33:01.391 --> 01:33:05.943
MARISHA: (laughs) (sighs)

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:12.772
LAURA: Are you going to do something, Beau? I
stick my head out. Are you planning a rebellion?

01:33:12.772 --> 01:33:17.333
MARISHA: No. I just want to make a ton of money
and drink a lot of booze.

01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:19.706
LAURA: Okay!

01:33:19.706 --> 01:33:20.915
LIAM: Insight check.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.749
One.

01:33:23.954 --> 01:33:26.366
(laughter)

01:33:26.929 --> 01:33:29.015
LIAM: Thanks, Pike.

01:33:31.279 --> 01:33:32.868
LAURA: I believe you.

01:33:32.868 --> 01:33:36.643
LIAM: We're going to hit the bars tonight.

01:33:37.864 --> 01:33:41.636
MARISHA: I think best we can do is try and be
happy in, as you said, this shitty situation that

01:33:41.636 --> 01:33:43.984
we've all been granted.

01:33:43.984 --> 01:33:45.500
LIAM: Nationwide, yeah.

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:51.580
MARISHA: Yeah. Anyway, should we go?

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.046
LIAM: Should we go or--?

01:33:53.046 --> 01:33:59.356
LAURA: Oh, sure. I crawl out from under the bed.
Caleb? I got you a present.

01:33:59.356 --> 01:34:02.619
LIAM: Did you? You bought that book?

01:34:02.619 --> 01:34:04.518
LAURA: I bought you history porn!

01:34:04.518 --> 01:34:07.597
LIAM: You bought me that book? That is so
expensive for this book. This is just smut.

01:34:07.597 --> 01:34:13.737
LAURA: Well, technically, you gave me the money
for it. Is it useful?

01:34:13.737 --> 01:34:16.741
LIAM: I don't know. I don't read things like
this.

01:34:16.741 --> 01:34:18.787
MARISHA: Mind if I take a look at it?

01:34:18.787 --> 01:34:20.248
LIAM: Yeah, you have it.

01:34:20.248 --> 01:34:23.927
MARISHA: I'm going to flip through it. Does
anything catch my eye based on what I know?

01:34:23.927 --> 01:34:30.835
MATT: I mean, do you want to sit and read it, like
full? If you skim through it, you see pages, like

01:34:30.835 --> 01:34:32.920
some of it smutty, some of it seems boring.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:41.110
LIAM: You know, the thing is, places like that are
like yard sales. 99% of the time, there is nothing

01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:48.669
but broken crap. But once, and I pat the book in
one of my holsters, I found something.

01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:51.401
LAURA: Is that the one I drew the dick in?

01:34:51.401 --> 01:34:58.633
LIAM: Did you draw the dick on the Friends spell?
You did it? That's the one.

01:34:58.633 --> 01:35:00.302
LAURA: Yes!

01:35:00.302 --> 01:35:02.165
LIAM: Yeah I found that in a porn shop.

01:35:02.165 --> 01:35:04.966
LAURA: Really? Are there pawn shops here?

01:35:04.966 --> 01:35:06.924
LIAM: Porn.

01:35:06.924 --> 01:35:08.639
LAURA: A porn shop?

01:35:08.639 --> 01:35:11.425
LIAM: Yeah. Hidden.

01:35:11.425 --> 01:35:22.542
MARISHA: You know, this reminds me of the stuff
that I used to read back in school.

01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:25.682
LAURA: You read porn in school?

01:35:25.682 --> 01:35:36.294
MARISHA: No, like all the history stuff. It feels
like a bored monk wrote this. A real bored monk.

01:35:36.294 --> 01:35:40.001
MATT: If you want to take the time to read it,
either now or another time, I can give you more

01:35:40.001 --> 01:35:43.540
information, but scanning through, you don't see
anything that catches your eye.

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.732
MARISHA: I might read it later when you're done
reading it.

01:35:45.732 --> 01:35:47.822
LIAM: You go first. Give me your review.

01:35:47.822 --> 01:35:48.585
MARISHA: Really?

01:35:48.585 --> 01:35:49.776
LIAM: Yeah. Have at it.

01:35:49.776 --> 01:35:51.450
LAURA: Caleb doesn't want it.

01:35:51.450 --> 01:35:54.763
MARISHA: It's a great gift. Honestly, I was
thinking about buying it and then you beat me to

01:35:54.763 --> 01:35:57.514
it. Great minds, right?

01:35:57.514 --> 01:36:00.509
LAURA: There you go. It was a present for you all
along. Well, I wish I would have known. I would

01:36:00.509 --> 01:36:02.983
have bought you that other shitty book you
bought.

01:36:02.983 --> 01:36:08.240
LIAM: I appreciate the gesture, because it is the
thought that counts. It's the gesture, Jester.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.172
LAURA: That's my name.

01:36:10.172 --> 01:36:11.521
LIAM: But seriously, thank you.

01:36:11.521 --> 01:36:13.161
LAURA: You're welcome.

01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:15.371
MARISHA: What's this book called? Does it have a
name?

01:36:15.481 --> 01:36:17.548
MATT: Yes. It is called--

01:36:17.548 --> 01:36:19.397
LIAM: A Tale of Two Titties.

01:36:19.534 --> 01:36:22.639
MATT: No. Courting of the Crick.

01:36:22.639 --> 01:36:26.076
LAURA, MATT, and MARISHA: Courting of the Crick.

01:36:26.076 --> 01:36:28.447
TRAVIS: Good luck adding that shit.

01:36:28.447 --> 01:36:32.713
MARISHA: I know. Yeah, I'm not going to be able to
type that in. I'll write that down.

01:36:38.107 --> 01:36:46.510
MATT: You've bought baked goods, you've bought
smut, and you've played in a hotel room. What do

01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:48.967
you guys want to do now?

01:36:48.967 --> 01:36:51.731
LAURA: I guess we can go back then.

01:36:51.731 --> 01:36:55.505
LIAM: There's a casino. You want to go to the
casino? I don't want to go there.

01:36:55.505 --> 01:36:59.242
LAURA: Are there any religious temples here?

01:36:59.242 --> 01:37:04.491
MATT: You'd have to ask around. Make an
investigation check.

01:37:07.706 --> 01:37:10.605
LAURA: That's shit. Six.

01:37:10.605 --> 01:37:15.830
MATT: You have a hard time finding somebody who
can give you any information. Most folks, a couple

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:22.828
of individuals you stop go like, "Oh I don't know
about religion (scoffs)," and walk away.

01:37:22.828 --> 01:37:25.856
Seems to be less of an interest 
in conversing with you.

01:37:25.856 --> 01:37:29.137
MARISHA: You see why I left this town? Ugh,
people.

01:37:30.348 --> 01:37:31.832
MATT: No luck on that, unfortunately.

01:37:31.832 --> 01:37:36.241
LAURA: What about in the Pillow Trove? Do they
have a little library there?

01:37:36.241 --> 01:37:42.877
MATT: They do not. It seems that they're not
providing anything simply to read. You'd probably

01:37:42.877 --> 01:37:46.742
have to bring in your own or purchase them from
the local Chastity's Nook.

01:37:46.742 --> 01:37:48.742
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:49.016 --> 01:37:53.057
LIAM: This neighborhood makes me a little edgy to
be honest. I'm done. But I will go with you if you

01:37:53.057 --> 01:37:54.405
want to go somewhere.

01:37:54.405 --> 01:37:56.400
LAURA: No, I think I'm good.

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.082
LIAM: Shall we go?

01:37:59.082 --> 01:38:00.560
MARISHA: Good when you all are good.

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.497
LAURA: (singing) Let's go back to the stinky part
of town.

01:38:03.497 --> 01:38:05.292
MARISHA: (singing) Okay.

01:38:05.292 --> 01:38:10.795
MATT: You guys meet up back at The Leaky Tap with
the rest of your party. You have already retrieved

01:38:10.795 --> 01:38:17.091
your freshly transposed enchantment on your
breastplate. You guys gather once again in the

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:20.459
tavern to consolidate your plans for the day.

01:38:20.459 --> 01:38:31.273
TRAVIS: Can I pull Molly aside? Hey, I wanted to
ask you. When you stopped Nott from rifling

01:38:31.273 --> 01:38:35.645
through my shit last night, what was she looking
for?

01:38:35.645 --> 01:38:39.365
TALIESIN: I didn't think to ask. Honestly.

01:38:39.365 --> 01:38:42.476
TRAVIS: She wasn't grabbing for anything in
particular?

01:38:42.476 --> 01:38:44.741
TALIESIN: Not that I remember.

01:38:44.741 --> 01:38:46.569
TRAVIS: She going through your stuff too or just
mine?

01:38:46.569 --> 01:38:51.979
TALIESIN: Oh god, no, not my stuff. That'd be
ridiculous. My stuff's worthless.

01:38:51.979 --> 01:38:54.905
TRAVIS: Just can't help herself, I guess.

01:38:54.905 --> 01:39:01.025
TALIESIN: Well, you know. Some people have needs.
It happens. Just keep an eye on your things and

01:39:01.025 --> 01:39:03.306
make sure you always know how much money is in
your purse.

01:39:03.306 --> 01:39:05.343
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:39:07.803 --> 01:39:13.455
MATT: At this point, it's early afternoon. Is
there anything you wish to do with your day? Any

01:39:13.455 --> 01:39:16.908
place you wish to go? Anybody you wish to talk to?
What do you want to do?

01:39:16.908 --> 01:39:21.809
LIAM: You know, I'm a little tuckered. I'm going
to take a rest upstairs. I'm going to copy that

01:39:21.809 --> 01:39:26.393
last spell into my book. I'll see you guys in a
little bit, maybe around dinner time.

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:30.306
MATT: Do you guys hang around until he's ready?

01:39:30.306 --> 01:39:34.870
LAURA: I guess I can go check out one of the
temples.

01:39:36.259 --> 01:39:43.945
TRAVIS: I'm going to wander around the back side
of The Leaky Tap.

01:39:43.945 --> 01:39:49.036
MARISHA: Before you leave, real quick, Beau asks
you if you found any information out while you

01:39:49.036 --> 01:39:50.634
were on your journey.

01:39:50.634 --> 01:40:00.312
TRAVIS: I didn't. Actually, I happened to ask
Pumat Sols, the plural, and he happens to be like

01:40:00.312 --> 01:40:03.408
an annex shop of the Cerberus Assembly.

01:40:03.408 --> 01:40:07.461
MARISHA: Really? I'm with it.

01:40:07.461 --> 01:40:12.856
TRAVIS: So he supplies goods to all parts of the
kingdom, but he says they keep a good balance in

01:40:12.856 --> 01:40:21.694
check from the power of the empire. Keeps a tight
leash. I didn't ask about any religious uprising

01:40:21.694 --> 01:40:26.674
or anything, but he seems like such a nice guy and
doesn't seem the type to rat.

01:40:26.674 --> 01:40:34.316
MARISHA: Right. Interesting. We went to the fancy
end of town where I'm pretty sure everyone is

01:40:34.316 --> 01:40:40.061
super into the crown because they are all funded
by the crown and they are the crown, so I was like

01:40:40.061 --> 01:40:43.372
eh, probably a bad place to start asking political
questions.

01:40:43.372 --> 01:40:44.986
TRAVIS: Nobody stopped you? You got in all right?

01:40:44.986 --> 01:40:49.783
MARISHA: We did, yeah! Went to a smut shop.

01:40:49.783 --> 01:40:52.083
TRAVIS: Oh good. How'd that go?

01:40:52.083 --> 01:41:01.621
MARISHA: As to be expected. Smutty. What should we
do?

01:41:01.621 --> 01:41:05.490
TRAVIS: Well I was just thinking, for this
evening, maybe we should double-check there aren't

01:41:05.490 --> 01:41:09.122
alternate exits coming in and out of that cellar.

01:41:09.144 --> 01:41:10.744
MARISHA: Yeah, in case it's a trap or something.

01:41:10.744 --> 01:41:12.980
TRAVIS: Yeah, that dwarf didn't really give me a
very good feeling.

01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:25.249
MARISHA: Also, we know that people are looking for
these type of rebels. If we can see a board

01:41:25.249 --> 01:41:33.761
ratting people out, so can other people. We don't
want to get caught in a sting operation, for lack

01:41:33.761 --> 01:41:35.788
of a better term.

01:41:35.788 --> 01:41:38.888
TRAVIS: Right. You want to walk around the back to
see if there's another way in?

01:41:38.888 --> 01:41:39.935
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:41:39.935 --> 01:41:44.460
TRAVIS: Can we go around the back of the tavern
and look for back doors, floor latches?

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:48.373
MATT: Sure. Do you guys want to make separate
investigation checks or does one of you want to

01:41:48.373 --> 01:41:50.095
help the other?

01:41:50.095 --> 01:41:51.803
TRAVIS: I'll help you make it.

01:41:51.803 --> 01:41:54.169
MATT: So you get advantage on your investigation
check.

01:41:57.509 --> 01:42:00.352
MARISHA: Big money! Are you fucking serious?

01:42:00.534 --> 01:42:03.070
TRAVIS: Which ones did you roll?

01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:06.697
MARISHA: Wait, they're both threes. I rolled two
threes. Both threes.

01:42:06.697 --> 01:42:08.449
TRAVIS: With the plus.

01:42:08.449 --> 01:42:11.203
MARISHA: Four, so seven.

01:42:11.203 --> 01:42:20.006
MATT: You spend a while looking around the back of
the tavern. There is a back entrance that leads

01:42:20.006 --> 01:42:27.061
into the kitchen. There is a cellar entrance.
You're not sure if it goes to the same place where

01:42:27.061 --> 01:42:32.674
you met or a separate subterranean space, but it
is currently locked off, chained.

01:42:32.674 --> 01:42:38.088
TRAVIS: Locked off, chained? Does this alley have
a lot of human traffic or are we on our own?

01:42:38.088 --> 01:42:41.540
MATT: No, you guys are on your own at the moment.

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.317
MARISHA: Can you try and pick this?

01:42:43.317 --> 01:42:44.978
TRAVIS: I mean, I have a crowbar.

01:42:44.978 --> 01:42:52.286
MARISHA: Oh my god. I'm going to stand watch in
the opening of the alley. I'm going to make sure

01:42:52.286 --> 01:42:54.483
while he does this.

01:42:54.483 --> 01:42:57.216
TRAVIS: Yeah. I have a crowbar.

01:42:57.216 --> 01:42:59.919
MATT: So you're going to go ahead and pry the
chain off of it?

01:42:59.919 --> 01:43:03.706
TRAVIS: Can I try and pop the lock? Is it like a
chain and a lock?

01:43:03.706 --> 01:43:05.132
MATT: Yeah it's a chain and a lock.

01:43:05.132 --> 01:43:08.137
TRAVIS: Oh shit. That's not as good.

01:43:08.137 --> 01:43:15.597
MARISHA: We could get Nott in here to try and pick
it. Just leave it nicely looked like it's not opened.

01:43:15.725 --> 01:43:19.667
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true. That is what she does.
You want to go snag her? I'll keep an eye.

01:43:19.667 --> 01:43:22.339
MARISHA: Yeah. I'll be right back. Nott!

01:43:22.339 --> 01:43:24.777
SAM: (gnawing) What?

01:43:24.777 --> 01:43:28.571
MARISHA: I hate to interrupt your dinner. Can we
borrow you for a quick second?

01:43:28.571 --> 01:43:31.148
SAM: (swallowing) Mm-hmm.

01:43:31.148 --> 01:43:37.240
MATT: You get led outside in the soft drizzled
exterior into the alleyway, feet clomping through

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:43.782
the muddy floor. They show you to the outside of
an angled door that leads to a basement cellar

01:43:43.782 --> 01:43:46.779
that is currently chained with a lock in the
center of it.

01:43:46.779 --> 01:43:48.246
MARISHA: Can you pick this?

01:43:48.246 --> 01:43:49.252
SAM: Can I pick that lock?

01:43:49.252 --> 01:43:50.337
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:43:50.337 --> 01:43:52.147
SAM: Keep a lookout.

01:43:52.147 --> 01:43:54.850
TRAVIS: I do a quick look. Both ends of the alleys
and on the windows around the area.

01:43:54.850 --> 01:43:56.416
MARISHA: Yeah. He takes one end; I take the
other.

01:43:56.416 --> 01:44:00.138
MATT: Perception check from each of you guys and
make a check with your thieves' tools.

01:44:00.675 --> 01:44:03.189
MARISHA: Jesus fucking ballsacks.

01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:04.692
SAM: (tink)

01:44:04.692 --> 01:44:06.076
TRAVIS: Mine's okay. 16.

01:44:06.076 --> 01:44:07.462
MARISHA: Seven again.

01:44:07.462 --> 01:44:15.449
SAM: One. It's magically enchanted. It's
magically-- Ah! My eyes! Ah! It's magically

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:16.641
enchanted!

01:44:16.641 --> 01:44:19.147
TRAVIS: Shh! I cover her mouth.

01:44:20.757 --> 01:44:22.643
SAM: Are my thieves' tools broken?

01:44:24.046 --> 01:44:25.632
MATT: Pretty bent.

01:44:27.812 --> 01:44:30.914
MARISHA: Oh that sucks. Oh I have thieves' tools!
Can I try?

01:44:30.914 --> 01:44:32.373
SAM: Give them to me!

01:44:32.373 --> 01:44:34.469
MARISHA: I give Nott my thieves' tools.

01:44:34.836 --> 01:44:39.593
MATT: Which is good, because your thieves' tools,
currently, are not very good. You're down one set.

01:44:39.593 --> 01:44:46.915
You can try again. You don't see anybody currently
heading down or near the alley at the moment.

01:44:46.915 --> 01:44:48.359
TRAVIS: No windows?

01:44:48.359 --> 01:44:54.209
MATT: No. There aren't any windows in the back of
the building, since there are small vents for

01:44:54.209 --> 01:44:57.200
kitchen smoke to filter out, but there's no
windows looking out into the alley.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.312
TRAVIS: No windows facing that way.

01:44:59.312 --> 01:45:02.228
SAM: Better. What do I add?

01:45:02.228 --> 01:45:05.999
MATT: You add your proficiency bonus and your
dexterity.

01:45:06.979 --> 01:45:08.620
SAM: 21.

01:45:08.848 --> 01:45:09.856
MATT: 21.

01:45:09.856 --> 01:45:12.591
SAM: These tools are so much better than mine.

01:45:12.591 --> 01:45:16.109
MARISHA: Yeah, I stole them off of a really rich
guy.

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:18.219
MATT: The lock comes straight off.

01:45:18.219 --> 01:45:19.230
SAM: Can I hang on to them for--

01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:20.338
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:45:20.338 --> 01:45:24.220
SAM: You can have mine. Actually you can't, I'd
like to keep them.

01:45:24.779 --> 01:45:27.041
MARISHA: You'll just owe me later, how about
that?

01:45:27.041 --> 01:45:28.580
SAM: Sure.

01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:33.814
MATT: Pull the lock of the chains, open the
cellar and look down. It's dark. There's no light

01:45:33.919 --> 01:45:35.619
source in there.

01:45:35.619 --> 01:45:37.139
TRAVIS: I have my orc--

01:45:37.139 --> 01:45:38.872
MARISHA: I put on the goggles.

01:45:38.872 --> 01:45:40.885
TRAVIS: Go for it, yeah. Might as well use that.

01:45:40.885 --> 01:45:44.626
MATT: You head down. It is a second cellar. It is
not the same cellar you guys have met with before.

01:45:44.658 --> 01:45:46.064
MARISHA: It's not the same cellar.

01:45:46.064 --> 01:45:48.220
MATT: No, this one can only be reached from the
exterior.

01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:53.063
MARISHA: There's no entrances? No secret
entrances? No trap doors hiding behind barrels?

01:45:53.063 --> 01:45:54.562
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:45:54.562 --> 01:45:56.468
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up this time, come on.

01:45:56.468 --> 01:45:57.670
MATT: You have--

01:45:57.670 --> 01:45:59.372
TRAVIS: That's cocked.

01:45:59.372 --> 01:46:01.878
MATT: You have disadvantage on this because there
is no light source.

01:46:01.878 --> 01:46:03.604
MARISHA: It's cocked on a 20.

01:46:03.604 --> 01:46:05.326
LIAM: Yeah, it's cocked.

01:46:05.326 --> 01:46:07.890
SAM: He said disadvantage.

01:46:07.890 --> 01:46:09.163
MARISHA: What?

01:46:09.163 --> 01:46:12.188
MATT: Because there's no light in there. So even
though you have darkvision, it's still dim light.

01:46:12.188 --> 01:46:18.864
MARISHA: Well. Okay. What am I doing?
Investigation? 11.

01:46:18.976 --> 01:46:24.339
MATT: You don't see any other passageways. No
hidden doors or anything. In fact, this one's

01:46:24.339 --> 01:46:28.763
fairly empty. There's a few barrels in here and
some small crates, but a lot has been moved out of

01:46:28.763 --> 01:46:32.803
here, either because it was recently used or it
hasn't been restocked.

01:46:32.803 --> 01:46:35.795
MARISHA: Any good bottles of wine or brews laying
around?

01:46:35.795 --> 01:46:38.034
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to search around for valuable
shit.

01:46:38.034 --> 01:46:43.426
MATT: Go for it. You find, not a bottle of wine,
but you find a couple of heavy jugs of some sort

01:46:43.426 --> 01:46:45.721
of an older ale.

01:46:46.671 --> 01:46:47.942
SAM: 23.

01:46:48.027 --> 01:46:55.345
MATT: 23? Okay, you glance around, you find a few
odd copper pieces that are in the dust. You do

01:46:55.345 --> 01:47:03.684
find a set of metal bracelets.

01:47:03.684 --> 01:47:06.830
SAM: Connected to each other?

01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:15.111
MATT: No. They're separate. But you do see they're
currently resting around a skeletal wrist.

01:47:15.111 --> 01:47:18.352
MARISHA: There's a skeleton down here?

01:47:18.352 --> 01:47:20.507
SAM: Is it a human size skeleton?

01:47:20.507 --> 01:47:23.778
MATT: It is a human size skeleton. It's been here
for a <i>long</i> time.

01:47:23.778 --> 01:47:26.718
SAM: (stuttering) Dead guy. Dead guy.

01:47:26.932 --> 01:47:30.549
MARISHA: Did they not clean when they bought this
place?

01:47:30.549 --> 01:47:33.025
SAM: This was some sort of a dungeon.

01:47:33.025 --> 01:47:37.782
TRAVIS: I come down at the mention of a skeletal
wrist. Are there any other bodies in this cellar?

01:47:37.782 --> 01:47:38.736
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:47:38.736 --> 01:47:40.479
MATT: That's the only one you find.

01:47:40.479 --> 01:47:42.493
MARISHA: Hang on, no one's around, right?

01:47:42.493 --> 01:47:43.898
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

01:47:43.898 --> 01:47:47.817
MARISHA: I'm going to pull out my adventurer's kit
and light a torch, because fuck this darkvision shit.

01:47:47.817 --> 01:47:53.170
MATT: So you get a torch situated. It lights up,
the room's brighter.

01:47:53.238 --> 01:47:56.821
MARISHA: No one knows we're down here, right? The
door's closed.

01:47:56.821 --> 01:47:59.954
TRAVIS: Well, I'm going to leave because we're all
three down here and go back up to the top and keep

01:47:59.954 --> 01:48:01.088
an eye.

01:48:01.088 --> 01:48:02.586
MATT: Okay.

01:48:02.586 --> 01:48:08.713
MARISHA: Okay. Do we see anything else weird? More
dead bodies, anything like that?

01:48:08.776 --> 01:48:13.615
MATT: No more dead bodies. Even this one you find
is mostly like it was stuffed behind some of the

01:48:13.615 --> 01:48:14.911
barrels.

01:48:14.911 --> 01:48:16.822
SAM: Can I tell how it died?

01:48:16.822 --> 01:48:18.752
MATT: You can make a medicine check.

01:48:19.978 --> 01:48:22.166
SAM: Not good. Five.

01:48:22.166 --> 01:48:23.826
MATT: No idea.

01:48:23.826 --> 01:48:26.175
SAM: Died of a broken heart.

01:48:26.175 --> 01:48:27.648
MATT: It's just a skeleton.

01:48:29.058 --> 01:48:31.043
SAM: No clothes?

01:48:32.079 --> 01:48:36.816
MATT: There is some elements of cloth on there but
it's been down here long enough to decompose to a

01:48:36.816 --> 01:48:42.288
mostly skeletal state. So it was probably here a
long time ago, and it was pressed up into this

01:48:42.288 --> 01:48:47.133
corner and barrels were pushed up against it to
keep it out of sight. Probably the reason it

01:48:47.133 --> 01:48:49.187
hasn't been found until now.

01:48:49.187 --> 01:48:52.267
SAM: Okay. Nothing to see.

01:48:52.267 --> 01:48:54.092
MARISHA: That's really gross.

01:48:54.092 --> 01:48:55.848
TRAVIS: No other ways in or out, huh?

01:48:55.848 --> 01:48:58.702
MARISHA: Yeah, anything else now that I have the
light on? I don't see anything?

01:48:58.702 --> 01:48:59.598
MATT: No.

01:48:59.598 --> 01:49:06.344
MARISHA: Shit. (long sigh) I take one of those
bottles of beer, then I leave.

01:49:06.344 --> 01:49:10.251
MATT: Okay. It's somewhat cloudy when you shake
it, but still full.

01:49:10.251 --> 01:49:14.644
TRAVIS: Close the door up, run the chain back
through, put the lock on it, but don't lock it.

01:49:14.644 --> 01:49:16.604
MATT: Okay, cool.

01:49:18.244 --> 01:49:25.263
Well. We're going to have to have a good, I don't
know, a good chain of eyes out as we're down there

01:49:25.343 --> 01:49:26.628
tonight.

01:49:26.628 --> 01:49:33.071
SAM: Do you want to establish some sort of, like,
if you get in trouble is there a way to alert us?

01:49:33.071 --> 01:49:36.443
MARISHA: Frumpkin? I don't know.

01:49:36.443 --> 01:49:39.269
TRAVIS: Not really, because if Caleb's going to be
down there with us-- I think, if we start

01:49:39.269 --> 01:49:42.810
screaming or you hear a ruckus--

01:49:42.810 --> 01:49:46.993
SAM: If I'm with you, I can cast Message and alert
our friends.

01:49:46.993 --> 01:49:49.182
TRAVIS: See, down there I'm not so worried.

01:49:49.182 --> 01:49:51.202
MARISHA and TRAVIS: It's about people coming in.

01:49:51.202 --> 01:49:53.503
SAM: Oh, well then I'll stay out and I'll Message
you when--

01:49:53.503 --> 01:49:55.029
MARISHA: Let's do that.

01:49:55.029 --> 01:49:58.539
TRAVIS: Yeah, somebody outside The Leaky Tap,
another person on the inside to run interference,

01:49:58.539 --> 01:50:00.626
because you can buy us a couple seconds.

01:50:00.626 --> 01:50:01.839
MARISHA: You can Message Caleb.

01:50:01.839 --> 01:50:02.892
SAM: I can Message any of you.

01:50:02.892 --> 01:50:04.072
MARISHA: Or any of us.

01:50:04.072 --> 01:50:05.400
TRAVIS: Yeah, couple layers, right?

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:12.274
MARISHA: Okay. Any other prep we should do?

01:50:12.274 --> 01:50:13.002
TRAVIS: Nah.

01:50:13.002 --> 01:50:15.168
MARISHA: Okay, let's do this.

01:50:15.168 --> 01:50:19.821
MATT: We still have a few hours until sundown. Do
you guys want to wait until the evening comes

01:50:19.821 --> 01:50:21.437
about? You can.

01:50:21.437 --> 01:50:24.881
MARISHA: Get food. I'll read some of my book.

01:50:24.881 --> 01:50:33.599
MATT: So as you guys rest, the evening's light
eventually comes to a darkened sky, the storm

01:50:33.599 --> 01:50:38.832
slowly begins to pass while the sky still remains
somewhat cloudy, the stars not visible. It appears

01:50:38.832 --> 01:50:47.344
that the heavy waterfall from the air above has
come to a patter, to a halt. As you prep for the

01:50:47.344 --> 01:50:53.265
tension of the evening's choices, we'll go ahead
and take a break. Be back here in just a moment, guys.

01:50:53.265 --> 01:50:55.145
SAM: High action.

01:50:55.145 --> 01:51:01.024
MATT: (laughing) This is some unique excursions
into the city today.

01:51:02.004 --> 01:51:03.775
TRAVIS: I'm so happy.

01:51:03.886 --> 01:51:05.324
MARISHA: Iva!

01:51:05.614 --> 01:51:09.073
TRAVIS: I remember my 12 and 13-year-old
excursions into the back of the comic book store

01:51:09.073 --> 01:51:15.541
with the 18 and up section. Oh man. "How old are
you kid?" "Pretty old."

01:51:15.541 --> 01:51:19.654
LAURA: You probably got away with it. You looked
like you were 30 when you were 18.

01:51:19.654 --> 01:51:24.541
MATT: Before we go to break, guys, it'll be our
Wyrmwood giveaway. This giveaway now is the cherry

01:52:03.464 --> 02:07:02.808
[break]

02:07:02.932 --> 02:07:05.745
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

02:07:05.745 --> 02:07:06.635
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:07:06.635 --> 02:07:08.298
TALIESIN: That was a sniper shot.

02:07:08.421 --> 02:07:14.135
MATT: Welcome back. First, before we dive back in 
we have our winner of the evening, it is Areski14!

02:07:14.228 --> 02:07:15.671
Congratulations.

02:07:15.832 --> 02:07:17.072
TRAVIS: "A risky 14"?

02:07:17.142 --> 02:07:18.091
MATT: Areski.

02:07:18.091 --> 02:07:19.127
TRAVIS: Areski!

02:07:19.205 --> 02:07:29.659
MATT: A-R-E-S-K-I 14, congratulations! We'll get
that to you ASAP. As you have taken the afternoon

02:07:29.659 --> 02:07:38.964
to rest within The Leaky Tap tavern, and the
midnight meeting looming, what would you guys, if

02:07:38.964 --> 02:07:42.175
anything, you want to do anything or do you want
to wait until the time transpires?

02:07:42.175 --> 02:07:50.336
SAM: You guys want to go anywhere? Pumat told me
that the Hall of Erudition is really cool and has

02:07:50.336 --> 02:07:56.520
some cool things in it if we wanted to check it
out. Or! We could go kill The Gentleman!

02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:57.674
MARISHA: Go kill--

02:07:57.674 --> 02:08:00.350
SAM: I don't know, is that what we're supposed to
do? Kill The Gentleman?

02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:02.396
LAURA: I don't think we're going to kill him right
off the bat.

02:08:02.396 --> 02:08:03.099
SAM: Kill him!

02:08:03.099 --> 02:08:04.498
MARISHA: That feels a little premature.

02:08:04.498 --> 02:08:05.901
TRAVIS: We don't even know who he is yet, right?

02:08:05.901 --> 02:08:08.245
SAM: Well, we could introduce ourselves and then
kill him!

02:08:08.245 --> 02:08:13.631
LAURA: He could have a whole infrastructure of
people supporting him and then they would come

02:08:13.631 --> 02:08:15.256
after us.

02:08:15.256 --> 02:08:16.881
SAM: All right.

02:08:16.881 --> 02:08:18.997
MARISHA: I want to know who he is, though.

02:08:19.164 --> 02:08:20.445
LAURA: Yeah.

02:08:20.445 --> 02:08:23.516
MARISHA: Super interested to find out who this guy
is. I feel like we should deal with one thing--

02:08:23.516 --> 02:08:25.154
I'm super focused on this current--

02:08:25.154 --> 02:08:26.414
TRAVIS: I am too.

02:08:26.414 --> 02:08:30.675
LAURA: I mean we could hang out in the lobby in
this bar, and I could watch every person that

02:08:30.675 --> 02:08:36.118
comes inside. I could draw their picture and know
every single patron that's in here so that we have

02:08:36.118 --> 02:08:39.569
something to turn into the guards when we rat
everybody out.

02:08:39.569 --> 02:08:40.488
SAM: Ooh!

02:08:40.488 --> 02:08:42.007
TALIESIN: That's a very good idea.

02:08:42.007 --> 02:08:44.380
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I was thinking. So the three of
us are down in the meeting.

02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:45.648
SAM: Who's going down?

02:08:45.648 --> 02:08:50.022
TRAVIS: The three of us. Nott, if you could be
outside, letting us know if any crownsguard or

02:08:50.022 --> 02:08:55.706
other surly types look like they're coming in to
raid the place, you send a Message, and then you

02:08:55.706 --> 02:09:00.279
two run interference if they actually make it
inside the doors, in case we haven't made it out yet.

02:09:00.279 --> 02:09:01.754
LAURA: Just be distracting!

02:09:01.754 --> 02:09:03.420
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever you do, buy us some time.

02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:04.475
LAURA: We're good at that.

02:09:04.475 --> 02:09:05.826
TALIESIN: We can be very distracting.

02:09:05.826 --> 02:09:07.338
TRAVIS: I believe you.

02:09:07.338 --> 02:09:10.500
MARISHA: Last thing we want is to take the fall
for these assholes, whoever they are.

02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:12.669
TRAVIS: These Knights of Requital.

02:09:12.761 --> 02:09:16.290
LAURA: We will hang out up here and just be weird.

02:09:16.290 --> 02:09:24.200
MATT: You guys spend the remainder of the evening
waiting for this to transpire, some patrons come

02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:28.392
in, some leave. You're reading through the book?

02:09:28.392 --> 02:09:30.247
MARISHA: Read the book!

02:09:30.247 --> 02:09:33.025
LAURA: Oh yeah, I have the "Tusk Love" too.

02:09:33.025 --> 02:09:35.139
MARISHA: You go back and forth.

02:09:35.139 --> 02:09:41.672
LAURA: I read it and I keep looking at Fjord
like-- and then go back and read it. I assume it's

02:09:41.672 --> 02:09:43.718
about some sort of orc love.

02:09:43.718 --> 02:09:46.021
MATT: It is, actually.

02:09:46.021 --> 02:09:48.652
TRAVIS: (laughing) Damn it. Son of a bitch.

02:09:48.652 --> 02:09:55.709
MATT: It deals with the union of half-orc and the
daughter of a traveling merchant as they meet on

02:09:55.709 --> 02:10:03.842
the Amber Road up near Druvenlode. It goes into a
saucy union between the two, but they can't,

02:10:03.842 --> 02:10:07.108
because what would the parents think? Yeah.

02:10:07.108 --> 02:10:09.665
LAURA: What's the name of the half-orc?

02:10:09.763 --> 02:10:10.676
MATT: Uh--

02:10:10.676 --> 02:10:12.256
SAM: (laughing)

02:10:15.784 --> 02:10:21.433
MATT: Oskar. With a K. Oskar.

02:10:24.143 --> 02:10:26.776
TRAVIS: What you reading there, Jester?

02:10:26.822 --> 02:10:33.890
LAURA: Nothing, Oskar. Don't worry about it.

02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:37.209
(laughter)

02:10:37.546 --> 02:10:45.710
MATT: Oh man. Beau, as you're reading through the
book, it's interesting. It begins to talk about

02:10:45.710 --> 02:10:52.836
the conflict between the Julous Dominion and the
Dwendalian Empire.

02:10:52.836 --> 02:10:56.671
MARISHA: Conflict between the Julous Dominion?

02:10:56.671 --> 02:11:06.002
MATT: Yes, the Julous Dominion and the Dwendalian
Empire. You're uncertain-- Make a history check?

02:11:06.002 --> 02:11:08.133
MARISHA: Dwendalian Emp.

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:16.545
That's good, 17.

02:11:17.176 --> 02:11:24.592
MATT: It begins to name generals and figures
caught in this political conflict in the center.

02:11:24.592 --> 02:11:31.230
Remembering back to your studies, these names
don't ring a bell. Either they're obscure or

02:11:31.230 --> 02:11:42.469
fictional for the purposes of the story. However,
it does speak of a Crick assassin that had snuck

02:11:42.469 --> 02:11:54.385
its way past the borders during the conflict, and
had attempted to take the life of a general named Theo.

02:11:55.061 --> 02:11:57.402
MARISHA: Theo, okay.

02:11:57.402 --> 02:11:59.098
SAM and MARISHA: Theo!

02:11:59.098 --> 02:12:00.793
MATT: (as Bill Cosby) Rudy!

02:12:00.793 --> 02:12:02.332
LIAM: Oh no.

02:12:02.332 --> 02:12:04.040
MARISHA: Ruined forever.

02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:16.604
MATT: Blame lots of Cosbys for that one. Sorry.
The failed assassination attempt led to the

02:12:16.604 --> 02:12:27.244
capture of the assassin during, essentially, a
test of wits between the general and this assassin--

02:12:27.689 --> 02:12:32.820
MARISHA: Okay, test of wits. Like, Dinner with
Andre style?

02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:41.145
MATT: Kind of, yeah. The assassin's been captured,
removes the helmet, and behind is revealed to be--

02:12:41.806 --> 02:12:44.574
MARISHA: The assassin removed his helmet?

02:12:44.574 --> 02:12:47.801
MATT: The assassin's helmet was removed by the
general after being caught.

02:12:50.781 --> 02:12:54.073
LAURA: That's the helmet we found in the
graveyard!

02:12:54.073 --> 02:12:58.391
MATT: It's not very good smut, at least at this
point.

02:12:58.611 --> 02:13:00.831
MARISHA: Wait, am I writing down smut right now?

02:13:00.831 --> 02:13:02.489
TRAVIS, MATT, and LIAM: Yes.

02:13:02.489 --> 02:13:06.402
TRAVIS: Of course you are. In size 38 font in your
fucking notebook.

02:13:06.402 --> 02:13:14.223
MARISHA: Hang on. Are you going into how Theo and
the assassin had a thing?

02:13:14.223 --> 02:13:15.988
MATT: Yes. We're getting there.

02:13:15.988 --> 02:13:20.564
MARISHA: Okay, keep going. I'm into it, though.
This has to be important!

02:13:20.564 --> 02:13:22.376
TRAVIS: Does it?

02:13:22.376 --> 02:13:24.562
MARISHA: He's telling it to me!

02:13:24.562 --> 02:13:26.615
SAM: Just listen! Just listen!

02:13:27.735 --> 02:13:37.891
MATT: The assassin is revealed to be from the Kryn
Empire of Xhorhas, with dark blue-purple skin,

02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:43.414
gray-white hair, and pointed ears of elvish
lineage.

02:13:44.304 --> 02:13:45.394
MARISHA: Okay.

02:13:45.394 --> 02:13:47.329
TRAVIS: No, leave it alone. Stop.

02:13:47.422 --> 02:13:49.740
MARISHA: He's a dark elf, right? Or a drow?

02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:58.494
MATT: She is. It's a female dark elf. The armor is
described to be chitinous, almost organic in its

02:13:58.494 --> 02:14:05.508
design, though metal. You learn a little bit. It
goes into a discussion of the term "Crick." The

02:14:05.508 --> 02:14:13.196
term "Crick" is actually a slur against the people
that come from the Xhorhasian side of Wildemount.

02:14:13.196 --> 02:14:25.830
It's short for cricket because supposedly when the
Kryn armies charge into battle, there are designed

02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:30.039
holes and tubes in the armor that sounds like a
flock of crickets rushing into battle.

02:14:30.169 --> 02:14:31.138
TRAVIS: Sick.

02:14:31.138 --> 02:14:32.906
MARISHA: That's cool.

02:14:32.944 --> 02:14:38.153
It's meant as an intimidation tactic. It's this high-pitched
screaming cricket chirp that rushes in, so that's

02:14:38.153 --> 02:14:43.496
where the term "Crick" comes from. It is used in a
derogatory fashion towards individuals who live

02:14:43.496 --> 02:14:51.391
within the empire of Xhorhas and Kryn. The book
talks about them dueling wits, finding common

02:14:51.391 --> 02:14:56.926
ground, and getting angry at each other and
murderous, then turns into this torrid love affair

02:14:56.926 --> 02:15:07.483
in this very Anthony/Cleopatra feel to it. It's
very dry. It's an older book. It doesn't match

02:15:07.483 --> 02:15:12.661
some of the imaginatory flair of some of the other
smut that you briefly perused as you were walking

02:15:12.661 --> 02:15:20.876
in the bookstore earlier. You glean a little bit
of information, should this be accurate at all, of

02:15:20.876 --> 02:15:28.562
some of the relationships or dynamics of the
empire and the Xhorhasian folk that live beyond

02:15:28.562 --> 02:15:30.419
the border.

02:15:30.419 --> 02:15:35.932
MARISHA: Would I be able to discern where the
assassin entered into the city?

02:15:35.932 --> 02:15:41.690
MATT: No, it's not a detailed historical book.

02:15:41.690 --> 02:15:47.741
MARISHA: It's not like, "by the third lamppost,
remove this brick." Okay, cool.

02:15:47.741 --> 02:15:49.513
MATT: There we go.

02:15:49.513 --> 02:15:51.395
MARISHA: This book sucks.

02:15:52.395 --> 02:15:54.556
LIAM: How far in are you?

02:15:54.556 --> 02:15:56.560
MARISHA: Halfway, maybe.

02:15:56.637 --> 02:15:59.232
LIAM: How long have you been working on it?

02:15:59.232 --> 02:16:02.015
MARISHA: Couple hours.

02:16:04.982 --> 02:16:14.827
MATT: As the evening clocks in close to midnight
and the majority of the patrons begin to dwindle

02:16:14.827 --> 02:16:25.667
and scatter into the night air, you watch as Ulog
enters quietly, gives a nod of knowing towards the

02:16:25.667 --> 02:16:33.314
two of you, then, on his own, steps down into the
cellar. About ten minutes or so later, you watch

02:16:33.314 --> 02:16:41.407
as Kara, the half-elf girl you had met before,
enters, gives you a glance, but doesn't

02:16:41.407 --> 02:16:48.390
acknowledge anything, orders a drink, leans
against the wall, then eventually disappears down

02:16:48.390 --> 02:16:54.112
into the cellar as well. Later on, you watch as
Dolan, the human you had spoke with, that seemed

02:16:54.112 --> 02:17:03.020
to be the one spearheading this meeting before,
enters with another human male. They both look

02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:10.181
back and forth, acknowledge you guys. The two of
them eventually splinter off to different sides of

02:17:10.181 --> 02:17:16.530
the room, waiting. One, and a few minutes later,
the other down into the cellar area.

02:17:16.530 --> 02:17:18.858
TRAVIS: Did we recognize the other human male that
he's with?

02:17:18.858 --> 02:17:20.093
MATT: No.

02:17:20.093 --> 02:17:25.438
TRAVIS: Does he seem to be armed, or shady, or
have lots of scars on his person?

02:17:25.438 --> 02:17:27.324
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:31.321
TRAVIS: 13.

02:17:31.321 --> 02:17:39.365
MATT: 13. Hard to tell at this distance. You
didn't see any visible or apparent scars or

02:17:39.365 --> 02:17:45.514
anything that gave you a sense of shiftiness,
other than the careful demeanor. It didn't look to

02:17:45.514 --> 02:17:48.290
be a face of a rugged soldier, by any means.

02:17:48.290 --> 02:17:52.447
LAURA: Did it look like an undercover cop, trying
to blend in?

02:17:52.447 --> 02:17:54.082
TALIESIN: How were his shoes?

02:17:54.082 --> 02:17:55.325
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:17:55.325 --> 02:17:57.349
TRAVIS: "How were his shoes."

02:17:58.610 --> 02:18:00.380
TALIESIN: Like nice loafers?

02:18:00.552 --> 02:18:01.655
LAURA: 20.

02:18:01.655 --> 02:18:10.388
MATT: Seems nervous, but not in a way that
triggers your spider-sense, so to speak.

02:18:14.518 --> 02:18:21.759
SAM: Are you guys still up top? Okay, I'm going to
go over to Fjord and say: You said that one of the

02:18:21.884 --> 02:18:24.748
members of their group is named Dolan?

02:18:24.748 --> 02:18:26.047
TRAVIS: That's right, yeah.

02:18:26.047 --> 02:18:31.901
SAM: If it comes up, no big, could you find out
that guy's last name?

02:18:31.901 --> 02:18:33.662
TRAVIS: Dolan's last name?

02:18:33.662 --> 02:18:34.967
SAM: Yeah.

02:18:34.967 --> 02:18:36.511
TRAVIS: Sure. Any reason why?

02:18:36.511 --> 02:18:40.224
SAM: I know a guy named Dolan Taverski.

02:18:40.224 --> 02:18:42.236
TRAVIS: Taverski?

02:18:42.236 --> 02:18:49.838
SAM: I don't really know, Taverski. I don't know.
I've heard it. Just find out his last name!

02:18:49.838 --> 02:18:54.403
TRAVIS: Sure. Is this guy from where you're from
or something? Old mate of yours?

02:18:54.403 --> 02:18:58.239
SAM: No, just have something of his.

02:18:58.239 --> 02:19:02.836
TRAVIS: Taverski. Would he know you if I was like,
"Hey, friend of ours named Nott--"

02:19:02.836 --> 02:19:06.145
SAM: No, nope, would not know me.

02:19:06.145 --> 02:19:08.634
TALIESIN: Insight check, watching this?

02:19:10.003 --> 02:19:11.752
SAM: Natural 20.

02:19:11.752 --> 02:19:13.752
TALIESIN: 16.

02:19:13.752 --> 02:19:20.810
MATT: 16 total? You get no bead on the wild words
that are coming out of her mouth.

02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:24.530
TALIESIN: What are-- no, never mind.

02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:26.994
TRAVIS: I'll find out his last name. I'm sure he
won't mind.

02:19:26.994 --> 02:19:30.445
SAM: I'll be up here. If I see anything
suspicious, I'm going to Message you.

02:19:30.445 --> 02:19:34.642
TRAVIS: That's right. Crownsguard, rough-looking
types, people that are armed, right?

02:19:34.642 --> 02:19:36.582
You keep a fucking swivel.

02:19:36.582 --> 02:19:42.211
SAM: Don't worry, I'll keep an eye out. I'll be in
disguise. I'm going to cast Disguise Self on

02:19:42.211 --> 02:19:50.312
myself, turning myself into a halfling with red
hair, green eyes, a hawkish nose, overalls,

02:19:50.312 --> 02:19:55.708
thinning on top, too-big shoes.

02:20:00.159 --> 02:20:02.614
TRAVIS: It's your best disguise yet.

02:20:02.614 --> 02:20:03.654
SAM: Yeah?

02:20:03.654 --> 02:20:08.076
TRAVIS: Nott? Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot it was you
for a minute.

02:20:08.076 --> 02:20:09.736
SAM: Call me a code name.

02:20:09.736 --> 02:20:11.019
TRAVIS: Oh. Tton.

02:20:11.107 --> 02:20:14.472
SAM: Tton. Yes.

02:20:14.539 --> 02:20:17.802
MARISHA: Yeah. Tton it is.

02:20:17.802 --> 02:20:19.352
TRAVIS: Tton. Yeah.

02:20:20.362 --> 02:20:21.111
T-Ton.

02:20:23.211 --> 02:20:25.310
LIAM: The second T is silent.

02:20:26.243 --> 02:20:28.903
SAM: I'm going to go outside and stand at the
front door.

02:20:28.903 --> 02:20:32.823
LAURA: Should we be outside too? Or should we stay
inside?

02:20:32.823 --> 02:20:37.231
SAM: No, you're supposed to stay inside. If I see
anyone coming, you distract them.

02:20:37.231 --> 02:20:39.775
LAURA: How will we know if you see anyone coming?

02:20:39.775 --> 02:20:41.979
SAM: I will tell you with my Message spell.

02:20:41.979 --> 02:20:44.179
LAURA: Okay, you will Message us, and then you
will Message the others?

02:20:44.179 --> 02:20:46.288
SAM: I don't know. I don't use it a lot.

02:20:46.288 --> 02:20:47.635
LAURA: Can you do it twice?

02:20:47.635 --> 02:20:49.590
SAM: I think I can do it twice. I can do it twice.

02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:50.757
LAURA: Okay.

02:20:50.757 --> 02:20:51.780
TALIESIN: Well, that'll work then.

02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:53.382
LAURA: Then, we'll just hang out in here and have
some fun.

02:20:53.382 --> 02:20:54.298
TALIESIN: Ah, yes.

02:20:54.298 --> 02:20:55.633
TRAVIS: You ready?

02:20:55.633 --> 02:20:56.670
MARISHA: Yeah. Let's do this.

02:20:56.670 --> 02:20:57.846
TRAVIS: Let's see what they want to do.

02:20:57.846 --> 02:20:58.992
MARISHA: Okay.

02:20:58.992 --> 02:21:04.166
MATT: Who all is going down? It's you three?

02:21:04.166 --> 02:21:05.595
TALIESIN: Table one.

02:21:05.595 --> 02:21:06.919
TRAVIS: It's these three jackasses.

02:21:06.919 --> 02:21:08.232
MARISHA: Table right.

02:21:08.232 --> 02:21:09.591
MATT: So you guys keep watch.

02:21:10.934 --> 02:21:16.130
As you descend into the cellar below, you
can see there's a table already set up with a few

02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:23.421
chairs around. There are two oil lamps that are
turned low, and the four figures you saw enter are

02:21:23.421 --> 02:21:29.782
all sitting around, waiting. As you begin to
descend, they give a knowing nod, and gesture to

02:21:29.782 --> 02:21:32.183
please take a seat.

02:21:32.183 --> 02:21:33.457
MARISHA: Is it just the four of them? No more?

02:21:33.457 --> 02:21:34.452
MATT: Just the four of them.

02:21:34.452 --> 02:21:35.577
MARISHA: Okay.

02:21:36.957 --> 02:21:38.620
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take a seat.

02:21:38.727 --> 02:21:41.408
MARISHA: Yeah, we sit. It's polite.

02:21:43.705 --> 02:21:55.347
MATT: As you enter, Dolan, the one who was leading
before, sits up and goes, "I'm sorry-- what, um--?"

02:21:55.347 --> 02:22:01.660
LIAM: Oh, I'm with my friends here, they've shared
a bit of what is gone on here and I'm sympathetic.

02:22:02.296 --> 02:22:06.132
TRAVIS: We haven't said too much, but we thought
that he might be somebody you'd be interested in.

02:22:06.132 --> 02:22:08.641
Very clever, has no love for the Empire.

02:22:08.641 --> 02:22:12.605
MARISHA: A valuable asset. Good with... things.

02:22:12.605 --> 02:22:15.789
TRAVIS: Thought we could let you decide for
yourself.

02:22:19.519 --> 02:22:25.775
MATT: They look to each other. "Have a seat."

02:22:26.237 --> 02:22:27.906
LIAM: Thank you.

02:22:27.906 --> 02:22:33.759
TRAVIS: Caleb, this is Dolan. Dolan, this is
Caleb. Dolan, do you have a last name?

02:22:35.339 --> 02:22:39.828
MATT: They glance about. "Dolan Thrym."

02:22:39.915 --> 02:22:41.896
MARISHA: Thrym.

02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:52.901
MATT: "This is Horris Thrym, my partner." The man
you saw enter earlier.

02:22:52.901 --> 02:22:53.996
MARISHA: The human male?

02:22:53.996 --> 02:23:01.219
MATT: Yes. "You know Kara and Ulog. What was your
name again, you said?"

02:23:01.219 --> 02:23:03.163
LIAM: Caleb.

02:23:03.163 --> 02:23:06.897
MATT: "Caleb. Thank you very much for meeting us.

02:23:06.897 --> 02:23:08.398
LAURA: Is it just the four of them?

02:23:08.398 --> 02:23:09.398
MATT: Just the four of them.

02:23:12.658 --> 02:23:16.750
Ulog has been-- and please, take no offense, we're

02:23:16.877 --> 02:23:24.971
just very careful-- keeping a very close eye on
your activities since we last met. Bit of a scare

02:23:25.081 --> 02:23:40.556
as you entered the King's Hall, but I've heard
that you've done a bit of business, unrelated. He

02:23:40.556 --> 02:23:51.635
speaks to your skill and we may have--" He looks
nervously over, and Horris leans forward and goes,

02:23:51.635 --> 02:24:04.434
"We put two months into planning something, and it
requires certain skill sets. Ulog, if you'd like

02:24:04.434 --> 02:24:10.310
to elaborate on this." The dwarf leans forward,
pulls one of the lanterns closer, so all your

02:24:10.310 --> 02:24:20.331
faces brighten up just a bit. He turns the wick up
a bit. "So we've intercepted some documents to

02:24:20.331 --> 02:24:28.421
Lord Sutan, one of the pretty faces and money
grabbers over there in the Tri-Spire. Very

02:24:28.421 --> 02:24:35.117
politically connected. Apparently, he's been doing
some business with a lowlife who's known in the

02:24:35.117 --> 02:24:46.828
more crown-based circles as one of those
arrest-on-sight types. We believe this individual

02:24:46.828 --> 02:24:49.206
might be involved with The Myriad.

02:24:50.412 --> 02:24:55.017
ALL: (whispering)

02:24:56.261 --> 02:25:00.598
MATT: "We tried to bring this information 
to the Lawmaster, Orentha,

02:25:00.671 --> 02:25:12.888
as she is a friend of Dolan's. However, we were
intercepted by the High-Richter Prucine. She's

02:25:15.258 --> 02:25:22.092
about as corrupt as you get in the structure here
in Zadash. She intercepted it, so that she

02:25:22.198 --> 02:25:30.845
delivered the information. I've heard nothing
since. A couple of our members have been closely

02:25:30.845 --> 02:25:42.009
watched by the Crownsguard ever since. So we
believe the High-Richter might be in on it. We've

02:25:42.009 --> 02:25:50.020
decided if we can somehow turn Lord Sutan against
the High-Richter, and then expose them to the

02:25:50.020 --> 02:26:00.615
Lawmaster, they'll either be arrested or ousted
from their positions. Which, one, would be victory

02:26:00.615 --> 02:26:07.268
for those who don't want to live under the claws
of corruption in this city. And two, vacates the

02:26:07.368 --> 02:26:14.907
position of High-Richter. While Horris' practice
may have been irrevocably damaged in the public

02:26:14.907 --> 02:26:22.727
eye, Dolan is a respected member of the society
here. The locals at least. We believe that, if not

02:26:22.727 --> 02:26:30.474
the High-Richter himself, perhaps another position
as things shift. It would behoove us--" Dolan puts

02:26:30.474 --> 02:26:37.336
his hand up and says, "It would be helpful to have
at least one of us with an ear on the bead of the

02:26:37.336 --> 02:26:46.737
inner circle of how law is distributed within
Zadash. While it is not my bailiwick, people seem

02:26:46.737 --> 02:26:56.270
to trust me, and I think that's the most important
thing when taking an office. We've outlined a

02:26:56.270 --> 02:27:04.293
means of doing so. This is where we may need your
help." Looks over to Kara, and the half-elf leans

02:27:04.293 --> 02:27:14.949
forward, "All right then, so, the current plan is
to infiltrate the Lord Sutan's estate in the

02:27:14.949 --> 02:27:23.579
Tri-Spire, steal a copy of his wax seal, and his
handwriting. After we forge a little of the

02:27:23.579 --> 02:27:31.078
correspondence to this unsavory individual who he
was speaking to in this letter, we make a new one

02:27:31.078 --> 02:27:38.738
that writes about an assassination of the
High-Richter, sealed, and signed by the Lord

02:27:38.738 --> 02:27:50.111
Sutan. Then, we infiltrate the home of the
High-Richter, tear apart her living space, look

02:27:50.111 --> 02:27:56.273
like it's been tousled and tossed, like someone
was seeking her while she was out for the night,

02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:03.763
at a local ball, which she'll be one night from
here. Before she returns to find her place

02:28:03.763 --> 02:28:14.573
destroyed, we take this letter that we found and
left it, hidden within her room. She finds the

02:28:14.573 --> 02:28:23.294
letter, brings it to the Lawmaster--" At this
point, Ulog pipes in real fast, "Sorry,

02:28:23.294 --> 02:28:29.499
misunderstood. She doesn't get the letter. We
deliver it ourselves to the Lawmaster. I don't

02:28:29.499 --> 02:28:31.390
trust her to take it."

02:28:32.850 --> 02:28:34.990
LAURA: (laughs) This is like us planning.

02:28:35.073 --> 02:28:36.272
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:28:36.272 --> 02:28:39.948
MATT: You get the sense that they're not the most
organized or experienced at this, but they're

02:28:39.948 --> 02:28:48.552
trying their hand at doing something that changes,
hopefully, the status quo they're used to. "So, we

02:28:48.552 --> 02:28:55.143
deliver the letter to the High-Richter, or the
Lawmaster. I prefer the High-Richter in front of

02:28:55.143 --> 02:28:59.269
the Lawmaster, if we can get the two in the same
room, so there's no escape. We see her

02:28:59.269 --> 02:29:05.349
anger-infused, then they begin to create turmoil.
Then, we expose them both, have them dropped or

02:29:05.534 --> 02:29:07.963
arrested, leaving the vacant spot, and they're
out.

02:29:11.425 --> 02:29:19.173
TRAVIS: Well, I have one question. This Lord
Sutan? What's to keep the High-Richter and the

02:29:19.173 --> 02:29:24.334
Lawmaster from just going and snatching him up and
putting him in chains?

02:29:24.947 --> 02:29:29.112
MATT: "Wait, from who?" Dolan puts his hand up and
says, "I'm sorry, reiterate that?"

02:29:29.112 --> 02:29:33.830
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, we're going to forge this
letter from Lord Sutan, right? Saying that there's

02:29:33.965 --> 02:29:39.594
an assassination attempt against the Richter. We
go to the Richter's place, we tossle it, then we

02:29:39.594 --> 02:29:45.492
deliver a letter from Sutan, saying there was an
attempt of the Richter's life. So if I was the

02:29:45.492 --> 02:29:51.456
Richter, and I went to the Lawmaster, I'd just go
disappear Lord Sutan. Your Richter will stay in

02:29:51.456 --> 02:29:56.544
his seat, and you'll be short one Lord, if I'm not
mistaken.

02:29:56.544 --> 02:29:59.321
MARISHA: Especially considering you said the
Richter was already pretty corrupted. Seems like

02:29:59.321 --> 02:30:04.316
assassination attempts in reverse wouldn't be out
of her bailiwick.

02:30:04.316 --> 02:30:07.052
MATT: "What do you suggest, then?"

02:30:10.060 --> 02:30:18.537
MARISHA: Here's my question to Dolan, why do you
want-- Horris wants to be in the office?

02:30:18.537 --> 02:30:24.147
MATT: No, Dolan is to be elevated. Horris is
taking a back seat.

02:30:24.147 --> 02:30:28.021
TRAVIS: Horris, if you don't mind me asking, what
was your practice?

02:30:28.021 --> 02:30:30.122
MATT: "I was a physician."

02:30:30.122 --> 02:30:31.564
TRAVIS: As well.

02:30:31.564 --> 02:30:40.113
MATT: "We had a practice together. One of us had
to take the fall. I accepted it myself. Dolan

02:30:40.113 --> 02:30:44.770
couldn't-- Dolan has too much at stake."

02:30:44.770 --> 02:30:53.375
MARISHA: Dolan, what makes you think that you can
beat the system that you would then be joining?

02:30:53.375 --> 02:30:59.943
MATT: "Well, the system's too big for us to
deconstruct from the outside. At the very least, I

02:30:59.943 --> 02:31:06.687
can hope to improve it from the inside. I know the
Lawmaster is a good woman. There are good people

02:31:06.687 --> 02:31:14.194
in there. But if we can root out the cancers, the
tumors that threaten to make it what it is, and

02:31:14.194 --> 02:31:19.343
what it could become, that's something. We have to
try."

02:31:20.117 --> 02:31:26.707
TRAVIS: I'm not shy of a conscience. I'm afraid
I'd need to know a little bit more about this

02:31:26.707 --> 02:31:33.673
High-Richter Prucine. Hopefully, he's a terrible
individual.

02:31:33.673 --> 02:31:41.426
MATT: "She. And yes. She has been responsible--"
Ulog, at this point, you can see his fingers

02:31:41.426 --> 02:31:49.504
gritting into the table. "She's the one who put my
wife in that blasted prison."

02:31:49.504 --> 02:31:51.787
TRAVIS: I remember you saying that.

02:31:51.787 --> 02:31:54.087
MARISHA: Yeah, sorry about that.

02:31:54.087 --> 02:32:04.263
TRAVIS: I mean, I hate to say anything else
without seeing something for ourselves. You seem

02:32:04.263 --> 02:32:08.408
to have a good plan for getting rid of Sutan, but
it seems you might need some further measures to

02:32:08.408 --> 02:32:11.425
get rid of this Richter as well.

02:32:11.425 --> 02:32:16.129
MATT: "We have been discussing that. If you have
any suggestions, please."

02:32:18.969 --> 02:32:28.811
MARISHA: Well, you could do a lot with a seal from
a lord. A lot more than claiming an assassination

02:32:28.907 --> 02:32:34.759
attempt. Just throwing it out there.

02:32:34.759 --> 02:32:36.611
MATT: "Like?"

02:32:36.611 --> 02:32:38.696
MARISHA: Literally anything else.

02:32:40.308 --> 02:32:45.613
TRAVIS: Do you feel like the Empire, or the
Lawmaster, is onto your group? Your Knights of

02:32:45.613 --> 02:32:48.589
Requital? Do they know your name?

02:32:48.589 --> 02:32:52.620
LIAM: Yeah, you have already mentioned that some
of your people were followed and eyed.

02:32:52.620 --> 02:33:03.177
MATT: "They don't, to my knowledge, know of the
group. Just some of the individuals."

02:33:04.147 --> 02:33:06.526
LIAM: Which ones, specifically?

02:33:07.523 --> 02:33:16.498
MATT: "Well, there is Themond, but he's left, and
has not gone to a meeting since he's started to be

02:33:16.498 --> 02:33:29.817
followed. He was the one who delivered the letter
to the High-Richter. It was mainly-- nothing

02:33:29.817 --> 02:33:37.774
directly related to our meetings and more just the
delivery of our intercepted letter."

02:33:37.774 --> 02:33:42.827
TRAVIS: I have a proposal for you. Are you one
hundred percent sure that they haven't heard of

02:33:42.827 --> 02:33:49.000
your name, Knights of Requital? How attached are
you to that name?

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:55.676
MATT: "Not. It wasn't something we chose, it just
emerged from our meetings."

02:33:55.676 --> 02:34:01.607
TRAVIS: If you ever want someone to stop looking
for something-- they'll stop as soon as they know

02:34:01.607 --> 02:34:08.672
that thing is gone, or dead. So how about we frame
High-Richter Prucine as the head of this Knights

02:34:08.672 --> 02:34:14.400
of Requital and let the law handle it the way they
will. And we'll take care of Lord Sutan at the

02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:16.042
same time.

02:34:16.618 --> 02:34:20.947
MATT: They all look to each other, and back.
There's a little bit of a smile, curls across

02:34:20.947 --> 02:34:32.185
Horris' face. He nods, "I think this is a pretty
sound step in the right direction."

02:34:32.185 --> 02:34:36.101
TRAVIS: I hate to do away with a great name, but
you work with what you have.

02:34:36.101 --> 02:34:37.180
MARISHA: It's an okay name.

02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:38.696
TRAVIS: You could workshop it.

02:34:38.696 --> 02:34:41.481
MARISHA: You could workshop it. There's always
more names.

02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:54.264
MATT: "Do we leave evidence of correspondence in
the home of the High-Richter, then?"

02:34:54.264 --> 02:34:58.658
TRAVIS: Do you have any secret symbols? Or stamps
or seals that you use for communication that we

02:34:58.658 --> 02:35:06.180
could plant in the house, or the place of dwelling
of the High-Richter? A ring, a piece of jewelry?

02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:10.643
MATT: "No. We've been very careful not to do that.
We could fabricate some."

02:35:10.643 --> 02:35:19.367
MARISHA: There was also the notice on the King's
Hall looking for y'all. I don't know if you knew

02:35:19.367 --> 02:35:25.806
that, by the way. I imagine a notice in one of
these people's houses might mean that they have

02:35:25.806 --> 02:35:27.670
concern of being found.

02:35:27.731 --> 02:35:32.643
TRAVIS: If we frame this the right way, it sure
would do a lot for your ambitions to become that

02:35:32.643 --> 02:35:37.282
High-Richter, Dolan, if you were the ones to turn
in the evidence.

02:35:41.152 --> 02:35:43.025
MARISHA: You could win twice.

02:35:44.314 --> 02:35:49.984
MATT: Dolan pipes up, "I'm worried about turning
in evidence, because there's nothing that could

02:35:49.984 --> 02:35:56.676
connect it to the spot. However, if we could plant
evidence in the estate of the High-Richter, and

02:35:56.676 --> 02:36:03.730
convince the Lawmaster, I believe if we speak to
her, she would at least do an investigation.

02:36:03.730 --> 02:36:09.387
They'd find this evidence in the home, in the
right place. That could be enough."

02:36:09.387 --> 02:36:11.390
TRAVIS: I think it would be.

02:36:11.390 --> 02:36:15.542
MARISHA: Now, the Lawmaster works under the
High-Richter, right?

02:36:15.542 --> 02:36:19.478
MATT: "The Lawmaster works above the
High-Richter."

02:36:19.478 --> 02:36:22.183
TRAVIS: Yeah. This will work.

02:36:22.183 --> 02:36:24.074
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:36:24.074 --> 02:36:35.117
MATT: You hear a (thump, hiss) as Ulog has pulled
the cork of a small bottle of ale that was sitting

02:36:35.117 --> 02:36:38.180
there for a while, and begins to drink.

02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:39.628
TRAVIS: Is her name Kara?

02:36:39.628 --> 02:36:41.491
MARISHA: Kara, I think it's Kara.

02:36:41.491 --> 02:36:47.680
TRAVIS: Kara, I like the enthusiasm you had about
your plan. What sort of skills could you bring to

02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:51.906
this equation? Are you stealthy? Sneaky?

02:36:51.906 --> 02:36:58.279
MATT: "Honestly, more of a thinker. Ulog,
however--" She points to the dwarf again, who has

02:36:58.279 --> 02:37:11.135
finished drinking, "Yeah, I used to run with some
pretty shifty lot. Done a bit of burglary in my past."

02:37:11.405 --> 02:37:18.535
MARISHA: I like that. Tell us about this Myriad, a
little bit. What is it exactly that you guys are

02:37:18.535 --> 02:37:20.923
so nervous about with these people?

02:37:22.553 --> 02:37:26.805
MATT: "We're not nervous about the Myriad, other
than the fact that the Myriad's a bunch of

02:37:26.805 --> 02:37:34.721
fuckheads that steal, enslave, and push all sorts
of unsavory business. They're the mirror side to

02:37:34.721 --> 02:37:43.418
the bullshit the Empire does. For all that, we
want to make sure that if we can connect any of

02:37:43.418 --> 02:37:50.728
them to the Myriad, and Lord Sutan is definitely
connected: two birds, one stone. But then we have

02:37:50.728 --> 02:37:53.771
to plant evidence in two."

02:37:54.076 --> 02:37:59.252
TRAVIS: That can be done. We have other
associates, upstairs. We didn't want to encroach

02:37:59.252 --> 02:38:04.167
too much on your space. We'd like time to confer
with them over the night, perhaps meet again

02:38:04.167 --> 02:38:12.213
midday tomorrow. We should find a new spot,
though. Repetition is a recipe for disaster.

02:38:12.562 --> 02:38:16.968
MATT: Dolan sits back. "It's a good point. Any
recommendations?"

02:38:16.968 --> 02:38:20.858
TRAVIS: We're actually quite new. Maybe you could
provide one.

02:38:20.858 --> 02:38:23.984
MATT: He thinks for a moment. Through his
paperwork.

02:38:23.984 --> 02:38:26.906
TRAVIS: Consult your paperwork.

02:38:28.078 --> 02:38:30.937
TALIESIN: Allow me to collect my additional
notes.

02:38:30.937 --> 02:38:33.383
MATT: Shut up.

02:38:33.383 --> 02:38:35.755
SAM: "Shut up."

02:38:35.755 --> 02:38:39.168
MATT: "How about The Song and Supper Inn?"

02:38:39.168 --> 02:38:41.178
TRAVIS: Song and Supper Inn?

02:38:41.178 --> 02:38:43.198
MATT: "It's on the west side of the Interstead
Sprawl."

02:38:43.285 --> 02:38:45.366
SAM: The "SAS."

02:38:45.867 --> 02:38:49.094
TRAVIS: How far from here? How much time to
travel? Not far?

02:38:49.094 --> 02:38:51.243
MATT: "Maybe 40 minutes on foot."

02:38:51.243 --> 02:38:54.815
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Shall we call it just after
noon tomorrow?

02:38:54.815 --> 02:38:59.007
MARISHA: What name should we be looking for?

02:38:59.007 --> 02:39:11.791
MATT: They all look at each other. Kara leans
forward, "Let's say-- The Inquiry."

02:39:11.791 --> 02:39:16.298
TRAVIS: The Inquiry. It's got a nice ring to it.

02:39:16.298 --> 02:39:19.152
MATT: "Thank you. I appreciate that."

02:39:19.152 --> 02:39:27.376
TRAVIS: Thank you for trusting us. I believe we
can make quite the impact with these movements.

02:39:27.376 --> 02:39:38.081
MATT: Dolan nods and smiles. Looks to Horris,
looks to the other two. "Thank you. We've been

02:39:38.081 --> 02:39:44.397
needing more than just angry voices of
half-enthused common folk. People of action are

02:39:44.397 --> 02:39:48.733
hard to find that seem to have a trusted heart."

02:39:48.733 --> 02:39:57.316
MARISHA: I'll give you one piece of advice, Dolan,
though. I would challenge you to think about this

02:39:57.316 --> 02:40:05.372
for the night, think real long and hard, if you're
willing to jump into the ring. Some pretty

02:40:05.372 --> 02:40:14.856
high-ranking asshole gladiators. Should probably
be willing to take a few licks. Shut up.

02:40:16.156 --> 02:40:18.066
SAM: (whispers) "Asshole gladiators."

02:40:18.066 --> 02:40:19.486
LAURA: "Taking a few licks."

02:40:19.486 --> 02:40:21.066
TALIESIN: Should've picked up a copy.

02:40:21.066 --> 02:40:26.510
I was trying to go "before you jump into the ring with
Muhammad Ali" type of thing, but Muhammad Ali isn't here.

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:28.959
TRAVIS: You gotta pull up. Pull up!

02:40:29.025 --> 02:40:31.637
LAURA: Yeah, lick those gladiator assholes!

02:40:31.979 --> 02:40:37.958
MATT: Dolan's stare goes a little distant as he
tries to fully comprehend the gravity of your

02:40:37.958 --> 02:40:40.311
statement before slowly nodding.

02:40:40.311 --> 02:40:43.282
TRAVIS: You see Fjord shift his weight.

02:40:43.634 --> 02:40:46.448
MARISHA: You know, make sure you know what you're
getting into.

02:40:46.448 --> 02:40:48.098
MATT: "I will."

02:40:48.098 --> 02:40:49.420
MARISHA: Awful people.

02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:51.218
MATT: "I will take that into consideration. Thank
you."

02:40:51.218 --> 02:40:53.851
MARISHA: Powerful tricks. That's all.

02:40:53.851 --> 02:41:02.993
MATT: "I appreciate that. And you, I guess as we
begin to put this together, what are your

02:41:02.993 --> 02:41:04.420
specialties?"

02:41:05.122 --> 02:41:13.329
LIAM: I dabble a bit in the arcane, nothing too
impressive, but a little more than nothing.

02:41:13.329 --> 02:41:23.737
MATT: "Good. Very well then, tomorrow afternoon,
The Song &amp; Supper."

02:41:24.366 --> 02:41:27.729
TRAVIS: Would you like to exit first or should
we?

02:41:27.729 --> 02:41:32.980
MATT: Ulog leans forward a bit and goes, "After
you."

02:41:32.980 --> 02:41:36.837
TRAVIS: Much obliged. I head out.

02:41:39.649 --> 02:41:41.665
LIAM: I'll go along with Fjord.

02:41:41.665 --> 02:41:43.599
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:41:44.657 --> 02:41:46.285
SAM: 17.

02:41:46.285 --> 02:41:50.416
MATT: No strange behavior, there doesn't seem to
be any business or activity towards the back or

02:41:50.416 --> 02:41:56.629
the alley. Nothing that catches your eye to be
suspicious or encroaching upon the meeting below.

02:41:58.300 --> 02:42:00.843
SAM: Everything's okay!

02:42:00.843 --> 02:42:05.679
TRAVIS: Wow, louder than I thought it would be.
Thank you, Nott.

02:42:05.679 --> 02:42:08.070
SAM: You can reply to this message.

02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:12.993
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you for keeping an eye out.
Would you like to join us inside?

02:42:12.993 --> 02:42:14.746
SAM: I can't reply.

02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:20.378
TRAVIS: Nott? Would you like to-- Hello?

02:42:20.378 --> 02:42:27.247
SAM: Six seconds. Yes! You can reply to this
message!

02:42:29.165 --> 02:42:33.889
MATT: You all regather in the center of The Leaky
Tap tavern.

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:40.740
TALIESIN: You come from being touched by some kind
of primordial chaos magic, something powerful,

02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:49.332
strange, creative, and bizarre. You've recently
had everything turned upside down--

02:42:49.332 --> 02:42:51.943
LAURA: I really have!

02:42:51.943 --> 02:42:57.576
TALIESIN: And have started a new path. The path
you are walking is not the one you were expecting.

02:42:57.576 --> 02:43:03.249
It's not the one you're going to find. It's true!
You are walking towards some destiny.

02:43:03.249 --> 02:43:04.695
LAURA: Does it say which one?

02:43:04.695 --> 02:43:06.731
TALIESIN: Just not the one you're expecting.

02:43:06.731 --> 02:43:07.943
LAURA: This is weird.

02:43:07.943 --> 02:43:09.358
TALIESIN: I only did three cards.

02:43:09.358 --> 02:43:11.142
LAURA: These are really, really, really good.

02:43:11.142 --> 02:43:12.146
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:43:12.146 --> 02:43:13.089
LAURA: That's a good fortune.

02:43:13.089 --> 02:43:14.798
SAM: Hello, strangers!

02:43:15.223 --> 02:43:17.862
LAURA: You have a booger on the tip of your nose.

02:43:17.862 --> 02:43:22.767
SAM: I'm just a traveling halfling!

02:43:22.767 --> 02:43:27.146
LAURA: Oh! I just told a random person they had a
booger on the tip of their nose.

02:43:27.146 --> 02:43:29.975
SAM: Yeah, I'm just a random person.

02:43:29.975 --> 02:43:32.759
TALIESIN: To be fair, you would tell a random
person they have a booger on their nose.

02:43:32.759 --> 02:43:37.617
LAURA: You're a random person with a really
familiar voice, though. You need to talk to Fjord,

02:43:37.617 --> 02:43:40.247
and see if you can figure out how to sound different.

02:43:40.247 --> 02:43:41.727
SAM: All right, all right.

02:43:42.757 --> 02:43:44.675
TRAVIS: Thanks for keeping an eye out.

02:43:44.826 --> 02:43:46.341
SAM: How did it go?

02:43:48.431 --> 02:43:49.555
MARISHA: Crazy!

02:43:49.984 --> 02:43:50.816
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:50.816 --> 02:43:52.082
TRAVIS: Caleb, impressions?

02:43:52.082 --> 02:43:53.614
LAURA: You were down there a really long time.

02:43:53.614 --> 02:43:57.314
LIAM: What is the benefit for us?

02:43:57.314 --> 02:44:03.903
TRAVIS: Well, my takeaway is that they want to
unseat some of the corrupted seats of power here

02:44:03.903 --> 02:44:10.244
in the city. If that's true, if there is an abuse
of power, I'm all for removing those corrupted

02:44:10.244 --> 02:44:17.584
seats and putting people of worth in their place.
I'm also not keen on taking the word of someone

02:44:17.584 --> 02:44:19.955
else without getting some evidence of our own.

02:44:19.955 --> 02:44:25.114
MARISHA: I agree. Who knows? We can't be replacing
someone corrupt with someone even worse.

02:44:25.114 --> 02:44:27.876
LAURA: We should follow one of them.

02:44:27.876 --> 02:44:32.431
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't know anything about this
Dolan, this Horris' motives, or their agenda.

02:44:32.431 --> 02:44:36.596
TRAVIS: We don't. While we're following them,
perhaps we should try and find out what we can

02:44:36.596 --> 02:44:46.072
about this-- Lean in closer. Closer. This
High-Richter Prucine.

02:44:46.072 --> 02:44:49.085
LAURA: Have the ones downstairs already left?

02:44:49.085 --> 02:44:51.172
TRAVIS: I don't know.

02:44:51.172 --> 02:45:01.366
MATT: At this point, you see Ulog make his way up
and take a different table at the far corner. Then

02:45:01.366 --> 02:45:06.159
slowly, over the next 15 or so minutes, the other
three exit the building.

02:45:06.159 --> 02:45:07.513
SAM: Want me to follow them?

02:45:07.513 --> 02:45:08.757
MARISHA: Should we go now?

02:45:08.757 --> 02:45:10.439
SAM: I'm going!

02:45:10.439 --> 02:45:12.900
LAURA: Wait, blessings!

02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:14.327
SAM: Oh, thank you!

02:45:14.327 --> 02:45:16.343
LIAM: I send Frumpkin after her.

02:45:16.343 --> 02:45:18.473
MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

02:45:20.153 --> 02:45:23.692
LAURA: It's like a dry skin. You got it!

02:45:23.835 --> 02:45:25.720
SAM: Thanks.

02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:27.563
TRAVIS: I couldn't see it.

02:45:27.563 --> 02:45:29.642
LAURA: Stealth role. With advantage!

02:45:29.642 --> 02:45:35.699
SAM: Stealth role? Okay, not good. Worse. 18.

02:45:39.599 --> 02:45:43.097
MATT: Which one are you following? There's the
half elf--

02:45:43.210 --> 02:45:44.680
SAM: Do I know any of their names?

02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:47.708
MATT: There's two human men and then there is the
dwarf male.

02:45:47.708 --> 02:45:50.426
MARISHA: We would have told you the two humans.
Two humans.

02:45:50.426 --> 02:45:52.628
SAM: The two humans. Are they traveling together?

02:45:52.628 --> 02:46:02.899
MATT: They are. You follow them for the next 20 or
so minutes before they come to a modest home. It's

02:46:02.899 --> 02:46:06.951
in a little bit of disrepair especially in the
recent the recent storm; part of the roof is

02:46:06.951 --> 02:46:14.027
sinking inward a little bit. They enter, close and
lock the door behind them. They glance through the

02:46:14.027 --> 02:46:19.833
window and they have a heated conversation back
and forth. If you want to listen, then make a

02:46:19.833 --> 02:46:21.340
perception check.

02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:22.175
SAM: Sure.

02:46:22.175 --> 02:46:24.103
LIAM: I have a hand on Beau's shoulder--

02:46:24.103 --> 02:46:25.307
SAM: Nine.

02:46:25.307 --> 02:46:27.599
EVERYONE: Nine!

02:46:27.599 --> 02:46:29.011
MATT: It's going to be a thing forever.

02:46:29.011 --> 02:46:32.814
TRAVIS: Yeah it should be every time. It's a rule.

02:46:32.814 --> 02:46:34.869
MARISHA: House rule.

02:46:38.166 --> 02:46:43.480
MATT: It's hard to hear. It's muffled; the wall's
thick. It's not an argument, more of a lot of

02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:48.884
passionate conversation back and forth, some
aggressive counter points to some sort of

02:46:48.884 --> 02:46:55.910
conversation. Eventually they both settle down
with a bottle of wine, and you glance through the

02:46:55.910 --> 02:47:01.100
window. You see the one with the blond hair is
sobbing into his arms at a table, and--

02:47:01.100 --> 02:47:02.302
SAM: This is a man?

02:47:02.302 --> 02:47:12.488
MATT: They're both men. The other one has his arm
around the other and consoles him. Looking inside,

02:47:12.488 --> 02:47:21.980
you see it's a lot of books across the wall, you
recognize there are some alchemical vials or other

02:47:21.980 --> 02:47:28.072
things that similar-type glass containers that can
be utilized for that. Some dried roots are hanging

02:47:28.072 --> 02:47:34.719
from the wall. A lot of them appear to be
medicinal in nature. After about 20 minutes or so

02:47:34.719 --> 02:47:41.105
of watching this, nothing strange catches your
eye. It seems like two people winding down after a

02:47:41.105 --> 02:47:42.224
stressful day.

02:47:42.646 --> 02:47:46.672
LIAM: Are any of those books of an arcane nature,
because I'm also looking?

02:47:46.672 --> 02:47:50.021
MATT: Make a perception roll for Frumpkin.

02:47:50.021 --> 02:47:53.984
LIAM: I'm looking through Frumpkin. Very bad.

02:47:53.984 --> 02:47:57.764
LAURA: She basically looks like a Pennywise, like
a teeny Pennywise peeking through their--

02:47:57.764 --> 02:47:59.268
MARISHA: Yeah, just a clown.

02:47:59.268 --> 02:48:00.871
MATT: Oh my god, it does!

02:48:02.488 --> 02:48:04.123
LIAM: Just an eight.

02:48:04.123 --> 02:48:08.390
MATT: It's too hard to see from the outside. You
can barely tell there are books there. The very

02:48:08.390 --> 02:48:11.890
low light there is inside, you can't make out any
details.

02:48:11.890 --> 02:48:12.789
SAM: Okay.

02:48:14.209 --> 02:48:17.878
It's a single level house?
Nothing fancy about it?

02:48:17.878 --> 02:48:23.826
MATT: Single level house, it might be two rooms.
No, it's not quite like impoverished, but it's

02:48:23.826 --> 02:48:25.704
not--

02:48:25.704 --> 02:48:29.508
SAM: Any papers? Any weapons visible?

02:48:29.508 --> 02:48:37.828
MATT: You do see a heavy crook of some kind, like
a staff with a big heavy wooden knot at the end.

02:48:37.828 --> 02:48:49.345
It can be used to defend oneself and also as a
walking stick. A shillelagh if you will. You can

02:48:49.345 --> 02:48:52.713
see a general shortsword that is put on a belt
that is hung on a wall, but nothing in there that

02:48:55.083 --> 02:48:57.258
is militarized.

02:48:57.258 --> 02:49:00.118
SAM: Okay. All right.

02:49:00.118 --> 02:49:06.072
I guess that's all I can glean from this.
I'll knock on the door, and then run away before

02:49:06.177 --> 02:49:07.900
they can see.

02:49:08.519 --> 02:49:14.162
MATT: Immediately inside you hear some rustling
and all the lights inside go out and it goes dark.

02:49:14.162 --> 02:49:16.007
You run away.

02:49:16.007 --> 02:49:17.911
SAM: Oh interesting.

02:49:17.911 --> 02:49:21.907
MARISHA: Actually, that was pretty cool. You
learned something!

02:49:22.362 --> 02:49:29.365
SAM: I'll go back and report to my friends. And
that's what I saw, Caleb, and the others of you

02:49:29.365 --> 02:49:35.305
who are not my friends, I'll also tell. Just
kidding guys, I love you.

02:49:35.365 --> 02:49:38.512
TRAVIS: You can drop that, uh--

02:49:39.959 --> 02:49:45.063
SAM: This is who I am now. I'm sure it's run out
by now.

02:49:45.185 --> 02:49:48.247
MATT: It lasts for an hour. It's probably run out
by now.

02:49:48.247 --> 02:49:50.993
TRAVIS: You know what we also need? I want some
eyes on this High-Richter.

02:49:50.993 --> 02:49:52.400
MARISHA: I agree.

02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:58.472
TRAVIS: We should find out where she lives and how
she treats people, see if the stories are true.

02:49:58.472 --> 02:50:01.411
LAURA: Maybe tomorrow morning we can go spy on her
house.

02:50:01.411 --> 02:50:04.829
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe we can even split a team,
some people go and spy on the house, some people

02:50:04.829 --> 02:50:09.069
maybe go to the stockade, talk to the people she's
locked up?

02:50:09.069 --> 02:50:12.485
TRAVIS: Sure. We might need to find out where she
lives tonight, though.

02:50:12.485 --> 02:50:13.682
MARISHA: I'm down for that.

02:50:13.682 --> 02:50:15.529
TRAVIS: I should have asked, but I forgot.

02:50:15.529 --> 02:50:18.504
MARISHA: Well, is Ulog still sitting at the other
table?

02:50:18.504 --> 02:50:24.964
MATT: At this point, he's probably left. It's been
about an hour since you returned.

02:50:24.964 --> 02:50:30.153
LAURA: It's hard to find that out without seeming
suspicious, isn't it?

02:50:30.153 --> 02:50:33.185
TRAVIS: No, the High-Richter is just an official.

02:50:33.185 --> 02:50:36.078
LAURA: But isn't it weird to go, "Where does the
High-Richter live?"

02:50:36.078 --> 02:50:38.822
TRAVIS: Not if you have official business with the
Richter.

02:50:38.822 --> 02:50:39.921
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:50:40.486 --> 02:50:42.168
MARISHA: At this hour?

02:50:42.168 --> 02:50:43.949
TRAVIS: It's very urgent business.

02:50:43.949 --> 02:50:48.526
SAM: We could find out how the High-Richter treats
people by posing as people in need.

02:50:48.526 --> 02:50:51.281
TRAVIS: Exactly what I was going to suggest.

02:50:51.281 --> 02:50:52.879
MARISHA: Interesting.

02:50:52.879 --> 02:50:54.555
LAURA: Let's disguise ourselves.

02:50:54.555 --> 02:50:56.136
TRAVIS: Well, we don't need to, Caleb--

02:50:56.136 --> 02:50:57.011
SAM: As clowns?

02:50:57.011 --> 02:50:58.351
LAURA: Yeah!

02:50:58.351 --> 02:51:05.309
LIAM: I'm sorry, I did not catch all of the
meeting that you went to the other night. Are they

02:51:05.309 --> 02:51:09.168
paying anything? Are we doing this for altruistic
reasons?

02:51:09.168 --> 02:51:12.029
TALIESIN: That is a very good question. I second
that question.

02:51:12.029 --> 02:51:14.176
MARISHA: I don't do anything for altruistic
reasons.

02:51:14.176 --> 02:51:15.998
TALIESIN: I've never done anything for free in my
entire life.

02:51:15.998 --> 02:51:18.098
LIAM: So has anything been discussed in advance,
is all I'm asking.

02:51:18.098 --> 02:51:22.076
MARISHA: Well, if this plan gets pulled off, and
we help Dolan get in that seat of the

02:51:22.076 --> 02:51:28.466
High-Richter, than we suddenly have friends in
high places. And I <i>love</i> an owed favor.

02:51:28.466 --> 02:51:31.675
TRAVIS: To answer Caleb's question, we kind of
forgot to discuss that part.

02:51:31.675 --> 02:51:33.247
MATT: You did.

02:51:34.577 --> 02:51:40.066
TRAVIS: We're new at this. We will address that
tomorrow, for sure, before we proceed any further.

02:51:40.205 --> 02:51:42.266
You're right, there should be compensation.

02:51:42.266 --> 02:51:47.085
LAURA: Do you want the rest of us to go tomorrow,
or do we still need to be look out?

02:51:47.085 --> 02:51:50.461
TRAVIS: No, I think we should all go. They should
get a look at us as a whole, see who they're

02:51:50.461 --> 02:51:53.496
dealing with, just in case there's any shady
shit.

02:51:53.496 --> 02:51:56.409
LAURA: Should we look like ourselves or other
people?

02:51:56.416 --> 02:51:58.190
TRAVIS: What would you like to look like?

02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:59.675
LAURA: I don't care.

02:51:59.675 --> 02:52:01.217
TRAVIS: It's at your discretion.

02:52:01.217 --> 02:52:04.910
LAURA: Okay. I'll decide on the day.

02:52:04.910 --> 02:52:07.669
TRAVIS: Anybody feel like finding out where this
High-Richter lives this evening?

02:52:07.669 --> 02:52:09.486
SAM: Yeah! Yeah!

02:52:09.486 --> 02:52:12.679
TRAVIS: Let's do it. How do we do that?

02:52:12.679 --> 02:52:14.649
(laughing)

02:52:14.649 --> 02:52:18.449
LAURA: Maybe we can ask the owner of here.

02:52:18.531 --> 02:52:19.575
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:52:19.575 --> 02:52:20.791
TRAVIS: That's a great idea.

02:52:20.791 --> 02:52:22.001
MARISHA: Start there, why not?

02:52:22.001 --> 02:52:22.627
TRAVIS: Jester.

02:52:22.627 --> 02:52:23.456
LAURA: Yes?

02:52:23.456 --> 02:52:24.400
TRAVIS: Charm him, ask.

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:32.271
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to go ask Claudia.

02:52:32.854 --> 02:52:35.654
MATT: It is about 1:00, 1:30 in the morning
though.

02:52:35.654 --> 02:52:37.342
LAURA: Oh, it's already that late.

02:52:37.342 --> 02:52:41.949
MATT: You guys met around midnight. So you can go
try and wake up Claudia, if you'd like.

02:52:41.949 --> 02:52:44.101
LAURA: Claudia's not awake?

02:52:44.101 --> 02:52:45.894
MATT: Not at the moment.

02:52:45.894 --> 02:52:48.107
TRAVIS: What about that big white dragonborn,
maybe he knows?

02:52:48.107 --> 02:52:49.751
LAURA: Maybe the barkeep?

02:52:49.751 --> 02:52:52.744
MATT: Wessek is there. Wessek is sitting back,
it's a very slow night.

02:52:55.784 --> 02:52:57.512
LAURA: Hey, Wessek.

02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:00.422
MATT: "Hello, little blue girl, what can I do for
you?"

02:53:00.422 --> 02:53:03.254
LAURA: How's it going with you? It's really late.

02:53:03.254 --> 02:53:06.533
MATT: "It is very late, and I'm sort of wondering
what you're bothering me with this late? I'm

02:53:06.533 --> 02:53:07.699
curious."

02:53:07.699 --> 02:53:13.232
LAURA: Well, I just remembered that I was supposed
to deliver a personal message to the High-Richter,

02:53:13.232 --> 02:53:18.562
and I can't remember where they live. Do you
know?

02:53:18.562 --> 02:53:20.140
MATT: "Sorry, I don't."

02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:23.086
LAURA: Do you know what area of town it would be
in?

02:53:23.086 --> 02:53:29.284
MATT: "I couldn't tell you. The High-Richter is
pretty, well, pretty high up there."

02:53:29.284 --> 02:53:31.964
LAURA: Probably like the Tri-Spires or something.

02:53:31.964 --> 02:53:35.804
MATT: "Most likely, or at least somewhere where
it's official. It's my guess."

02:53:35.804 --> 02:53:40.107
LAURA: Okay, that was a fun conversation, goodbye.

02:53:40.107 --> 02:53:42.081
MATT: "Goodbye!"

02:53:42.081 --> 02:53:44.721
MARISHA: Is The Pillow Trove still open?

02:53:44.721 --> 02:53:47.335
LAURA: The Pillow Trove is an inn, of course it's
open.

02:53:47.335 --> 02:53:50.513
MARISHA: We can try and ask there, huh?

02:53:50.513 --> 02:53:53.766
TALIESIN: Getting in would be a little tricky,
you'd have to get by the guards.

02:53:53.766 --> 02:53:55.370
SAM: It's 1:00 in the morning.

02:53:55.370 --> 02:54:01.590
TRAVIS: Yeah. Perhaps we should rest tonight and
plan this little needy-folk charade in the

02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:06.459
morning. We can always take the sewers into the
Tri-Spires.

02:54:06.459 --> 02:54:07.761
MARISHA: I know, that's what I was thinking.

02:54:07.761 --> 02:54:09.288
LAURA: (yawning) We totally can.

02:54:09.288 --> 02:54:10.276
LIAM: What did you say?

02:54:10.276 --> 02:54:12.355
LAURA: I said we totally can do that.

02:54:12.355 --> 02:54:18.496
TRAVIS: Caleb, you've mentioned you tried to get
into the Tri-Spires and you had a disguise on, and

02:54:18.496 --> 02:54:19.765
it didn't--

02:54:19.765 --> 02:54:27.426
LIAM: I did not have a--oh yeah. There is some
sort of wards on the gates there. It's something

02:54:27.426 --> 02:54:32.118
I've done 100 times in small towns. I tried to
disguise myself, and there was nothing there, they

02:54:32.118 --> 02:54:35.438
saw right through it, and 
they were dicks about it.

02:54:35.438 --> 02:54:39.921
TRAVIS: Do you think it was just in that passage
way or do you think it's the entire Tri-Spire area?

02:54:40.036 --> 02:54:43.220
LAURA: I feel like that would be a really big
enchantment to put on the the entire thing.

02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:45.442
LIAM: It is not the entire Tri-Spire, because--

02:54:45.442 --> 02:54:47.089
TRAVIS: The entire Tri-Spire?

02:54:47.089 --> 02:54:55.050
LIAM: No, not. Not Nott, it is not. I cased the
smut shop, I looked for arcane things there and

02:54:55.050 --> 02:54:58.956
did not, well. But I was able to use my abilities.

02:54:58.956 --> 02:55:05.262
TRAVIS: That'll be it. We use the sewers to get
in, disguise ourselves, avoid detection, find out

02:55:05.262 --> 02:55:07.564
what we need to know.

02:55:07.564 --> 02:55:09.225
TALIESIN: I can work with this plan.

02:55:09.225 --> 02:55:10.781
LAURA: I like it.

02:55:10.781 --> 02:55:12.422
TRAVIS: Shall we retire for the night?

02:55:12.422 --> 02:55:14.186
MARISHA and SAM: Yes.

02:55:14.186 --> 02:55:19.373
TRAVIS: I'll head up to my room first and I'll
pull Molly up with me, because I need to have a

02:55:19.373 --> 02:55:27.147
word with him. Molly, listen. I can't get over the
fact that Nott was going through my stuff. I want

02:55:27.147 --> 02:55:30.020
to set a little bit of a trap.

02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:32.488
TALIESIN: Oh, you want to set some sort of trap or
example for her?

02:55:32.488 --> 02:55:35.431
TRAVIS: Yeah. I just want to see if she's learned
her lesson or not.

02:55:35.431 --> 02:55:36.616
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:55:36.616 --> 02:55:39.566
TRAVIS: I'm going to put an object in the middle
of the room with our door open, and we're going to

02:55:39.566 --> 02:55:41.513
hide out of sight. You game?

02:55:41.513 --> 02:55:44.054
TALIESIN: This seems a little unfair.

02:55:45.576 --> 02:55:46.596
Sure.

02:55:46.596 --> 02:55:52.820
TRAVIS: Great. I'll use Minor Illusion to put in
the middle of the room a bundle of buttons with a

02:55:52.820 --> 02:55:57.738
tall, shiny flask covered in jewels, right in the
middle of the room.

02:55:57.738 --> 02:56:02.787
TALIESIN: Do we want to put down some ball
bearings? I've got a big bag of them.

02:56:02.787 --> 02:56:05.829
TRAVIS: I mean, I guess so. Once she's in, we're
going to shut the door. I want to figure out what

02:56:05.829 --> 02:56:07.736
the fuck she's sneaking around for.

02:56:07.736 --> 02:56:08.494
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:56:08.494 --> 02:56:09.726
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:56:09.726 --> 02:56:13.059
MATT: So both of you guys go and hide? Stealth
check from both of you.

02:56:15.874 --> 02:56:16.952
TRAVIS: 16.

02:56:18.492 --> 02:56:19.469
TALIESIN: 11.

02:56:19.469 --> 02:56:22.151
MATT: You have a passive perception of--?

02:56:22.151 --> 02:56:24.650
SAM: 12 or something? Right? Where is it?

02:56:24.735 --> 02:56:26.225
LAURA: Probably 13.

02:56:26.225 --> 02:56:28.061
MATT: No, passive perception I believe for you
is--

02:56:28.061 --> 02:56:29.291
SAM: Ten.

02:56:29.291 --> 02:56:30.749
LAURA: Really?

02:56:30.749 --> 02:56:33.374
MATT: As you all go to bed, what are you doing?

02:56:33.374 --> 02:56:35.145
MARISHA: Sleeping.

02:56:35.145 --> 02:56:36.604
MATT: You guys go to sleep--

02:56:36.604 --> 02:56:39.562
LIAM: Oh, wait, I knock on Jester and Beauregard's
door.

02:56:39.562 --> 02:56:46.336
LAURA: (gasps) What is it that you want, knocking
on our door so late at night, Caleb?

02:56:46.336 --> 02:56:48.390
MARISHA and TRAVIS: You've been reading too much
smut.

02:56:48.390 --> 02:56:51.056
(laughter)

02:56:51.056 --> 02:56:53.877
MARISHA: No more Oskar for you.

02:56:53.877 --> 02:56:57.367
LAURA: What is it, Caleb?

02:56:57.367 --> 02:57:00.016
SAM: (sultrily) I brought my tusk.

02:57:00.016 --> 02:57:01.819
LIAM: You are turning in?

02:57:02.599 --> 02:57:04.546
MARISHA: Should I not?

02:57:04.581 --> 02:57:11.764
LIAM: No, by all means, but I have changed my
mind. I feel guilty for discarding the book that

02:57:11.764 --> 02:57:15.027
you purchased for me and I was wondering if I
could read it tonight, but only if you are going

02:57:15.027 --> 02:57:16.420
to bed.

02:57:16.420 --> 02:57:21.213
MARISHA: Yeah, see what you can find. Have I
finished it? I haven't finished it.

02:57:21.213 --> 02:57:24.156
MATT: You haven't finished it yet, but a little
over halfway.

02:57:24.162 --> 02:57:27.552
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to read it before bed. It
will take me about an hour. Good night.

02:57:27.552 --> 02:57:30.282
LAURA: (cackles) I think he was bragging at you.
Good night, Caleb!

02:57:30.467 --> 02:57:36.115
MARISHA: I'll give it to him, it's fine. He needs
a little self confidence, a little encouragement?

02:57:36.115 --> 02:57:38.438
MATT: Okay, you go read it. Nott, what are you
doing?

02:57:38.438 --> 02:57:45.968
SAM: I feel the urge to go sneak into a room.

02:57:45.968 --> 02:57:49.078
TRAVIS: It's just an open door with a bunch of
buttons and a flask in it.

02:57:49.078 --> 02:57:49.971
SAM: It's not even locked?

02:57:49.971 --> 02:57:51.089
MATT: No.

02:57:51.089 --> 02:57:53.378
SAM: Oh, well, I'll push it open and look inside.
What do I see?

02:57:53.378 --> 02:58:01.296
MATT: It's empty, it's dark, except for you see
this-- Actually, make a-- Let me check one thing

02:58:01.296 --> 02:58:06.827
on this. Just to see how this works in this
circumstance.

02:58:10.863 --> 02:58:13.807
MARISHA: Lot of great shirts in the store. Great
shirts.

02:58:13.807 --> 02:58:15.720
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:18.655
SAM: I mean, what is this? What is this roll?

02:58:18.655 --> 02:58:20.191
LAURA: That is majorly cocked.

02:58:20.191 --> 02:58:21.596
SAM: Okay, good.

02:58:21.596 --> 02:58:23.508
SAM and LAURA: (groan)

02:58:23.508 --> 02:58:25.257
LAURA: You should have taken the cocked.

02:58:25.257 --> 02:58:27.281
SAM: Seven.

02:58:27.281 --> 02:58:36.505
MATT: There you see a shining bag of glittering
coin and buttons spilling out of the top of this

02:58:36.505 --> 02:58:37.947
small satchel.

02:58:37.947 --> 02:58:48.318
SAM: Why would this even be here? And a flask on
top? Wow! Do I see Fjord's belongings over near

02:58:48.318 --> 02:58:49.613
his bed?

02:58:49.613 --> 02:58:51.136
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:58:51.136 --> 02:58:53.213
SAM: I'm going over there.

02:58:53.213 --> 02:58:57.861
TRAVIS: As soon as she comes in the door, the door
slams shut. Molly, get the window!

02:58:57.861 --> 02:58:59.313
TALIESIN: Right!

02:58:59.313 --> 02:59:02.506
SAM: I draw my hand crossbow!

02:59:02.506 --> 02:59:03.314
TRAVIS: Nott--

02:59:03.314 --> 02:59:04.590
SAM: Are you an imposter?!

02:59:04.590 --> 02:59:14.125
TRAVIS: No. We are going to have a talk. Don't try
any funny business. Why are you trying to sneak

02:59:14.125 --> 02:59:16.194
through our stuff?

02:59:16.194 --> 02:59:20.016
SAM: I would never do that to a friend!

02:59:20.016 --> 02:59:24.976
TRAVIS: Molly told me! Molly told me you were in
here rifling through my stuff.

02:59:25.851 --> 02:59:31.469
SAM: I was hungry. There's a definite explanation
for this.

02:59:31.469 --> 02:59:32.909
TRAVIS: What were you looking for?

02:59:32.909 --> 02:59:38.350
SAM: Seafood. You must have some on you; you're of
the sea. I love shrimp, and I never get a chance

02:59:38.350 --> 02:59:44.879
to get any, we're so landlocked in here. I love
the taste of the sea!

02:59:44.879 --> 02:59:46.843
TRAVIS: Do I believe her?

02:59:46.843 --> 02:59:50.055
MATT: You can go ahead and make an insight check.

02:59:51.582 --> 02:59:53.544
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:59:54.274 --> 02:59:56.016
SAM: I was not looking for shrimp.

02:59:56.016 --> 02:59:59.302
(laughter)

02:59:59.587 --> 03:00:04.056
TALIESIN: Nott, dear? Why don't you tell the nice
man the truth? Devil's Tongue.

03:00:04.056 --> 03:00:07.945
SAM: Oh! What is that? What does that do? What is
that?

03:00:07.945 --> 03:00:10.520
MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

03:00:11.460 --> 03:00:14.008
TRAVIS: That's why I brought you in here.

03:00:14.073 --> 03:00:16.324
SAM: Wisdom? Ten.

03:00:16.324 --> 03:00:18.824
MATT: You are charmed by Mollymauk.

03:00:18.824 --> 03:00:20.466
SAM: What does that mean?

03:00:20.466 --> 03:00:26.832
MATT: Meaning, you're very friendly and amiable,
and take his advice and suggestions like a very

03:00:26.832 --> 03:00:28.624
dear friend.

03:00:28.624 --> 03:00:32.580
TALIESIN: Probably should just tell him what you
were really looking for.

03:00:36.580 --> 03:00:41.581
SAM: I was looking for your letter to the Soltryce
Academy.

03:00:42.433 --> 03:00:45.425
TRAVIS: My letter? But, Nott, why?

03:00:45.425 --> 03:00:47.494
SAM: (whispering) I want it.

03:00:47.494 --> 03:00:53.956
TALIESIN: What for? It's fine, no one's in
trouble.

03:00:53.956 --> 03:00:58.070
SAM: I want to give it to Caleb.

03:00:58.070 --> 03:01:01.180
TRAVIS: Well, why? What would Caleb do with it?

03:01:01.180 --> 03:01:07.050
SAM: What you would do with it. Study, learn
magic, become more powerful.

03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:13.863
TRAVIS: You wouldn't want me to have that sort of
ability, you'd rather Caleb have it?

03:01:14.884 --> 03:01:20.852
SAM: I don't know a lot about magic, but I know he
has the potential to be very powerful.

03:01:20.852 --> 03:01:21.841
TRAVIS: You do?

03:01:21.841 --> 03:01:24.203
SAM: And I need him to be.

03:01:24.203 --> 03:01:29.933
TRAVIS: Why, Nott? Why do you need him to be
powerful?

03:01:30.166 --> 03:01:32.744
SAM: So he can save me.

03:01:37.304 --> 03:01:46.285
TALIESIN: I mean, we can help save you, that's
what friends do. Any of us who get more powerful

03:01:46.285 --> 03:01:48.755
can help you.

03:01:49.180 --> 03:01:54.994
TRAVIS: Nott, what do you need to be saved from?

03:01:55.865 --> 03:02:08.441
SAM: (sighs) So much. So much. But mainly, there's
a lot of dangers in the world, and a lot of

03:02:08.441 --> 03:02:20.737
dangers for me, and especially the closer we get
to the north? I think? They don't like me up

03:02:20.737 --> 03:02:24.714
there. He can protect me.

03:02:26.630 --> 03:02:28.813
TALIESIN: I think we can all do that.

03:02:28.813 --> 03:02:29.985
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

03:02:29.985 --> 03:02:35.073
SAM: No. No, you can't.

03:02:37.503 --> 03:02:45.823
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Nott, I hope you will
learn to trust us and rely on us like you do

03:02:45.823 --> 03:02:52.047
Caleb. We may not be as powerful as he is, or has
the ability to become, but certainly we can help

03:02:52.047 --> 03:02:59.129
you. Are you worried about something or someone in
particular finding you?

03:02:59.129 --> 03:03:11.916
SAM: Maybe. Yes, there's a few people that I'm
worried about, but no one specific where we're

03:03:11.916 --> 03:03:29.680
going. I know that people are always trying to get
me, and (stammering) I wish-- I need his magic to

03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:40.500
be there for me when I need safety. I need him. I
need him to live.

03:03:40.694 --> 03:03:45.220
TRAVIS: I understand. I'm sorry if we've upset
you.

03:03:45.220 --> 03:03:47.802
SAM: No, you're cool for some reason right now.

03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:49.994
TALIESIN: We're all friends.

03:03:49.994 --> 03:03:54.515
TRAVIS: Not for some reason, I'm just cool in
general, Nott. <i>I'm just cool in general, Nott.</i>

03:03:55.467 --> 03:03:57.365
SAM: So cool.

03:03:58.045 --> 03:03:59.898
TRAVIS: This shit is amazing.

03:03:59.898 --> 03:04:02.865
TALIESIN: It's not going to last, you do know
that. It's not going to last.

03:04:02.868 --> 03:04:04.494
TRAVIS: Just for now, though.

03:04:04.494 --> 03:04:06.154
TALIESIN: Well, enjoy it while you have it.

03:04:06.154 --> 03:04:10.545
TRAVIS: Promise me that you will not go through my
things anymore when I'm not around, and that the

03:04:10.545 --> 03:04:13.516
items that I have belong to me?

03:04:13.516 --> 03:04:22.635
SAM: Will you give me the letter? I could change
your name on it to his name, and then he could use

03:04:22.635 --> 03:04:34.115
it to get into the school, and he could learn more
powerful magic and then he could change me.

03:04:35.645 --> 03:04:36.975
TRAVIS: Change you?

03:04:36.975 --> 03:04:39.223
SAM: He could change this.

03:04:41.501 --> 03:04:48.785
TRAVIS: (clears throat) I understand. I know what
it feels like to be ashamed or worried about what

03:04:48.785 --> 03:04:51.886
you look like. I do.

03:04:52.323 --> 03:05:01.347
SAM: But you're pretty handsome for a half-monster
thing. (whispering) I think Jester likes you.

03:05:01.347 --> 03:05:02.181
TRAVIS: You think so?

03:05:02.181 --> 03:05:03.442
SAM: Yeah.

03:05:03.442 --> 03:05:05.643
TRAVIS: Well, I didn't always look like this.

03:05:05.643 --> 03:05:07.459
SAM: What?

03:05:07.459 --> 03:05:12.532
TRAVIS: I wasn't always a handsome half-monster
thing.

03:05:12.532 --> 03:05:14.663
SAM: What did you use to be?

03:05:14.663 --> 03:05:16.750
TRAVIS: A kid, just like anyone else.

03:05:16.750 --> 03:05:18.398
SAM: Still a monster thing, though.

03:05:18.398 --> 03:05:19.310
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:05:19.310 --> 03:05:23.687
SAM: Oh. Just a less handsome one.

03:05:23.687 --> 03:05:27.036
TRAVIS: Yeah. Stumpy, short. Big teeth.

03:05:27.036 --> 03:05:28.911
SAM: Were you a fat kid?

03:05:28.911 --> 03:05:36.670
TRAVIS: Little bit. Just sort of mis-proportioned.
Listen, if we get to the--

03:05:36.670 --> 03:05:38.166
SAM: Do you have any pictures or--?

03:05:38.166 --> 03:05:40.612
(laughter)

03:05:40.612 --> 03:05:46.632
TRAVIS: If my MySpace is still up, you could see
them. Goes back a tick.

03:05:46.632 --> 03:05:48.821
SAM: Did you ever have braces or anything?

03:05:48.821 --> 03:05:54.016
TRAVIS: Nope. No, I did my own dental work.
Listen, if we get to the Soltryce Academy and that

03:05:54.088 --> 03:05:58.532
letter doesn't do me any good, I promise, you
could have it and we'll make sure Caleb has a

03:05:58.532 --> 03:05:59.512
shot.

03:06:00.276 --> 03:06:02.774
SAM: Will you promise to keep Caleb alive?

03:06:02.774 --> 03:06:04.622
TRAVIS: Most definitely.

03:06:04.622 --> 03:06:07.659
TALIESIN: We're going to try and keep both of you
alive.

03:06:07.659 --> 03:06:09.017
SAM: All right.

03:06:09.017 --> 03:06:12.026
TRAVIS: You look out for us, we'll look out for
you.

03:06:12.026 --> 03:06:15.182
SAM: Can I ask you one favor?

03:06:15.608 --> 03:06:18.246
TRAVIS: You cannot have my stuff.

03:06:18.246 --> 03:06:21.178
SAM: All right. Never mind.

03:06:22.842 --> 03:06:29.007
TALIESIN: Remember, Nott, that next time you try
and do this and if that letter goes missing again,

03:06:29.007 --> 03:06:35.100
I can do this to you again. I give her just enough
of a knock on the head to break the spell.

03:06:35.100 --> 03:06:36.637
MATT: Okay.

03:06:36.637 --> 03:06:46.212
TRAVIS: Okay, easy! Easy! Open up the door! I open
the door and I slowly open it up like trying to

03:06:46.212 --> 03:06:52.458
funnel a rat out of the room. Here you go.
Remember what we talked about.

03:06:53.748 --> 03:06:55.413
SAM: I reach for the flask.

03:06:56.827 --> 03:06:57.505
Fuck!

03:06:57.552 --> 03:07:01.007
(laughter)

03:07:01.557 --> 03:07:03.927
TRAVIS: I stick my foot out right when she runs
by.

03:07:03.927 --> 03:07:07.931
MATT: Oh, man. Make an acrobatics check.

03:07:07.931 --> 03:07:10.098
TRAVIS: You should be fine.

03:07:10.660 --> 03:07:13.023
SAM: Acrobatics check? 12.

03:07:13.023 --> 03:07:16.931
MATT: 12? That's enough. As you're darting
through, you see the foot go out, and you leap,

03:07:16.931 --> 03:07:22.964
tumble, roll and make your way into the hallway
and escape back to your chambers.

03:07:23.932 --> 03:07:26.374
TRAVIS: Man, that was more than I thought.

03:07:26.374 --> 03:07:28.417
TALIESIN: That was very interesting.

03:07:28.417 --> 03:07:30.627
TRAVIS: What do you make of all that?

03:07:30.627 --> 03:07:35.614
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't know. People are strange.
Anyone who looks like us, you collect a few

03:07:35.614 --> 03:07:39.327
interesting enemies on the way, even at her age.

03:07:39.327 --> 03:07:41.876
TRAVIS: Are you praying over your swords tonight?

03:07:41.876 --> 03:07:43.049
TALIESIN: Of course. Every night.

03:07:43.135 --> 03:07:44.512
TRAVIS: All right. Can I join you?

03:07:44.512 --> 03:07:45.653
TALIESIN: Sure.

03:07:45.653 --> 03:07:46.887
TRAVIS: Great.

03:07:46.887 --> 03:07:51.392
LIAM: Come on, I'm just putting up the thread,
come to bed. Come to bed.

03:07:51.392 --> 03:07:54.839
SAM: Do you trust Fjord and Molly?

03:07:56.597 --> 03:07:59.343
LIAM: No. No, I don't.

03:08:00.613 --> 03:08:02.527
SAM: Me neither.

03:08:06.353 --> 03:08:08.527
LIAM: (poof) Alarm.

03:08:08.527 --> 03:08:17.700
LAURA: And then Oskar falls in love with her! And
he carries her across a field, and they love each

03:08:17.700 --> 03:08:19.431
other so much!

03:08:19.431 --> 03:08:20.779
MARISHA: That's so great.

03:08:20.779 --> 03:08:23.859
LAURA: It's the most beautiful story, Beau!

03:08:25.545 --> 03:08:27.646
MARISHA: Can we go to sleep, now?

03:08:27.646 --> 03:08:29.622
LAURA: Yeah.

03:08:31.677 --> 03:08:34.089
TRAVIS: Yeah, the hard turn!

03:08:34.310 --> 03:08:37.782
MATT: You guys all eventually find yourselves to
rest for the evening, awaking in the early

03:08:37.782 --> 03:08:45.485
morning. The chilled morning air comes through.
The sky: still mostly gray, with patches of blue

03:08:45.485 --> 03:08:48.270
that poke through. No rain, it's still a little
chilled. There's a bit of fog burning off by the

03:08:48.270 --> 03:08:53.919
time you awaken and look out your room's window.
The morning is yours, what do you wish to do?

03:08:55.883 --> 03:08:59.227
LIAM: I go to Jester and Beauregard's room and
say--

03:08:59.227 --> 03:09:01.969
LAURA: (sultrily) Oh, you're back again already,
Caleb.

03:09:01.969 --> 03:09:06.810
LIAM: Good morning, sleepy heads! I leave the book
leaning against the door.

03:09:06.810 --> 03:09:09.204
TRAVIS: Killed it in one night. Damn.

03:09:09.204 --> 03:09:13.480
MATT: All righty. The rest of you gather--

03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:14.976
TRAVIS: Yep. Downstairs.

03:09:14.976 --> 03:09:16.281
MATT: You have your morning breakfast.

03:09:16.281 --> 03:09:18.306
MARISHA: Did you find anything good in this?

03:09:18.306 --> 03:09:20.136
LIAM: Did I find anything good in it?

03:09:20.136 --> 03:09:31.102
MATT: More reinforcing more of what was there.
Because a lot of the information about Xhorhasian

03:09:31.102 --> 03:09:37.639
society is still largely unknown or uncatalogued,
you get the sense the more you read, and the more

03:09:37.639 --> 03:09:43.612
the perspectives of this assassin's left across
the way, you're uncertain as to how accurate any

03:09:43.612 --> 03:09:54.066
of it is-- but it talks of a torturous society of
bloodshed and beasts, a-- I got an eyelash in my

03:09:54.066 --> 03:09:55.817
eye, that's great.

03:09:55.817 --> 03:09:57.193
TRAVIS: Oh, that's the worst.

03:09:57.193 --> 03:10:03.016
MATT: There we go. Okay, we're good. Talking of
this terrible life of endless wastes of

03:10:03.016 --> 03:10:12.405
carnivorous and cannibalistic creatures and that
the Crick nation being this terrible place of

03:10:12.405 --> 03:10:24.062
perpetual inner turmoil, and vying for the next
position of power. The assassin that falls into

03:10:24.062 --> 03:10:28.652
this relationship falls into it as perspective of
being saved, of being taken from this terrible

03:10:28.652 --> 03:10:38.722
place and brought into the good graces of this
General, and brought into the comforting realm of

03:10:38.722 --> 03:10:47.994
the Empire. However, upon being discovered, ends
up being captured, tried, and killed. The last

03:10:47.994 --> 03:10:53.639
part of the book deals with the General going
through his own grief and the process, but also

03:10:53.639 --> 03:11:01.949
understanding it never could be, and was probably
for the best. You're left with a unsatisfied meh

03:11:01.949 --> 03:11:03.557
feeling at the end of it all.

03:11:03.557 --> 03:11:05.245
TRAVIS: Would you call it a blue balls feeling?

03:11:05.245 --> 03:11:06.252
MATT: Kind of.

03:11:06.252 --> 03:11:09.743
LIAM: There was a lot more historical fiction in
it than actual pornographic content, I was

03:11:09.743 --> 03:11:11.056
surprised.

03:11:12.037 --> 03:11:16.837
MARISHA: It doesn't really ultimately matter, but
I feel like that was like a toxic relationship. I

03:11:16.837 --> 03:11:27.010
didn't really feel like the assassin and Theo
should have-- I mean, he led to her death. That

03:11:27.010 --> 03:11:29.026
kind of sucks.

03:11:29.026 --> 03:11:32.689
LIAM: Feels like it's weighing on you. It's
amazing what a good book can do, it gets its grips

03:11:32.689 --> 03:11:34.247
into you.

03:11:36.867 --> 03:11:38.900
SAM: Are we a book club now?

03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:41.713
TRAVIS: Morning, Nott.

03:11:41.713 --> 03:11:44.904
SAM: Yeah, morning.

03:11:46.302 --> 03:11:48.781
LAURA: What's wrong? Did you guys get into a
fight?

03:11:48.781 --> 03:11:53.926
TALIESIN: Nott is just upset because she was
trying to do a little reading last night as well.

03:11:53.926 --> 03:11:56.507
MARISHA: Did you get a book?

03:11:56.507 --> 03:11:59.046
SAM: Not exactly.

03:11:59.046 --> 03:12:01.188
LAURA: Here, Nott. You can read this now.

03:12:01.188 --> 03:12:02.403
SAM: Which is this one?

03:12:02.403 --> 03:12:03.825
LAURA: That's the Tusk Love.

03:12:03.825 --> 03:12:05.168
SAM: All right!

03:12:05.168 --> 03:12:08.998
(laughter)

03:12:12.008 --> 03:12:17.091
TRAVIS: So we set out our plan. Sewers. Make
ourselves look like poor folk. Make our way into

03:12:17.091 --> 03:12:18.115
the Tri-Spire.

03:12:18.115 --> 03:12:20.146
LAURA: Not poor folk, rich folk.

03:12:20.146 --> 03:12:23.796
SAM: Oh wait, no, but we're seeking help of the
Richter.

03:12:23.796 --> 03:12:28.136
LAURA: It doesn't matter, we can't be poor folk in
the Tri-Spire. We need to be rich folk that need

03:12:28.136 --> 03:12:29.385
help from the Richter.

03:12:29.385 --> 03:12:30.590
SAM: Okay, that's fine.

03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:34.219
LIAM: Yeah, because if we come out looking like
rats, then out we will go.

03:12:34.219 --> 03:12:36.921
SAM: Upper middle class? Lower middle class?

03:12:36.921 --> 03:12:38.098
TRAVIS: Upper middle.

03:12:38.098 --> 03:12:40.461
LAURA: Very high middle if not low upper.

03:12:40.461 --> 03:12:42.636
TRAVIS: Medium well?

03:12:42.636 --> 03:12:44.936
SAM: We're a family that is down on our luck,
because--?

03:12:44.936 --> 03:12:47.371
LAURA: Like a warm, pink center.

03:12:47.371 --> 03:12:55.911
SAM: What's our cover story? What's the ruse here?
We need help from the government because bandits

03:12:55.911 --> 03:12:57.983
have taken over our house?

03:12:57.983 --> 03:13:03.664
LAURA: Yes! Oh! Yes, how about we have a trading
company! How about some of our wares got stolen on

03:13:03.664 --> 03:13:07.977
the road on the way to Zadash by a group of
bandits?

03:13:07.977 --> 03:13:18.542
SAM: Oh! We know things, why don't we pose as like
Trostenwald brewers or something and our brew

03:13:18.542 --> 03:13:25.369
shipment-- I'm spitballing-- got stolen by someone
and we need help to get it back!

03:13:25.369 --> 03:13:28.862
TRAVIS: Do we know if the High-Richters normally
rule on or govern over?

03:13:28.972 --> 03:13:31.975
LIAM: Yeah, I was going to ask if the two empire
kids know about that position.

03:13:31.975 --> 03:13:35.419
MATT: You know that the High-Richter is the
associate judge to the Lawmaster. The Lawmaster

03:13:35.419 --> 03:13:43.358
oversees very high profile judgments, and then
anything that falls below anything high-profile.

03:13:43.358 --> 03:13:44.752
MARISHA: Circuit judge.

03:13:44.752 --> 03:13:48.834
MATT: Circuit judge, is what the High-Richter is.
Things go through the High-Richter first before

03:13:48.834 --> 03:13:53.955
they go to the Lawmaster. They gauge what is
important enough for the Lawmaster and what

03:13:53.955 --> 03:14:00.051
remains in their circle, which is why you can see
the frustration with anything that they try to

03:14:00.051 --> 03:14:06.857
bring forth that may have been incriminating to an
ally of the High-Richter could be easily caught in

03:14:06.857 --> 03:14:09.018
that net and not brought upward.

03:14:09.018 --> 03:14:13.713
MARISHA: I have this inventory sheet that I got
from the Baumbauchs, we could use this as claims

03:14:13.713 --> 03:14:17.429
that it got stolen. And hope for reimbursement.

03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:20.729
SAM: Stolen by someone in the government?

03:14:20.729 --> 03:14:25.275
TRAVIS: Or stolen by the Baumbauchs? I mean, if we
do something that a family within the Tri-Spire

03:14:25.275 --> 03:14:31.085
needed representation, the law upheld, but the
Richter turned an eye because a more powerful

03:14:31.085 --> 03:14:34.551
family was winning out, then that person is shit.

03:14:34.551 --> 03:14:38.232
MARISHA: This is like an order invoice that I
have, right?

03:14:38.232 --> 03:14:41.913
MATT: The order ledger or you mean the letter?

03:14:41.913 --> 03:14:44.704
MARISHA: No, the order ledger.

03:14:44.704 --> 03:14:47.309
TRAVIS: From the brewery, that we took in session
zero.

03:14:47.309 --> 03:14:51.209
MATT: Right, you're not talking about the letter
from Baumbauch from the Gentleman, right?

03:14:51.209 --> 03:14:53.722
MARISHA: No, but in that I have an order ledger?

03:14:53.722 --> 03:14:55.353
MATT: Yes, there is.

03:14:55.353 --> 03:15:00.044
MARISHA: So we could claim that he never paid due
and we are looking for some sort of representation

03:15:00.044 --> 03:15:02.766
to try and get our money from the Baumbauchs?

03:15:02.766 --> 03:15:04.906
TALIESIN: I didn't understand any of that.

03:15:04.906 --> 03:15:06.929
LAURA: I have a forgery kit, you guys!

03:15:07.962 --> 03:15:09.513
SAM: What are we forging?

03:15:09.513 --> 03:15:13.876
TRAVIS: I don't know if he would hold sway, but if
he doesn't pursue justice, for someone of the

03:15:13.876 --> 03:15:18.916
Tri-Spire, that should tell us enough. The
Baumbauchs are very influential and powerful.

03:15:18.916 --> 03:15:20.687
LIAM: Yes, that's true.

03:15:20.687 --> 03:15:23.687
LAURA: We could change the name of the Baumbauchs
to something else.

03:15:23.687 --> 03:15:25.503
SAM: We could be the Baumbauchs.

03:15:25.503 --> 03:15:27.068
TRAVIS: What do you think, Molly?

03:15:27.068 --> 03:15:29.589
TALIESIN: I honestly don't understand any of
this.

03:15:29.589 --> 03:15:38.639
MARISHA: Does it say on the ledger the company
that it came from? Does it say like from Dryer

03:15:38.639 --> 03:15:41.053
Supply and Co.?

03:15:41.661 --> 03:15:43.604
TALIESIN: What accent was that?

03:15:43.604 --> 03:15:44.727
LAUREN: Dwarven.

03:15:44.727 --> 03:15:48.000
MARISHA: Me! Me being an asshole.

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:49.989
MATT: The Timalt Store House.

03:15:49.989 --> 03:15:51.998
MARISHA: The Timalt Store House.

03:15:51.998 --> 03:15:53.336
MATT: Correct.

03:15:53.336 --> 03:15:55.301
TRAVIS: Doesn't Timalt make hardware?

03:15:55.301 --> 03:15:57.619
MARISHA: So it can be from the Timalts.

03:15:57.619 --> 03:16:01.582
SAM: The Baumbauchs stole our stuff?

03:16:01.582 --> 03:16:04.348
MARISHA: They never paid due on the order that we
sent them.

03:16:04.348 --> 03:16:06.615
SAM: Do we even know the Baumbauchs are here?

03:16:06.615 --> 03:16:08.233
MARISHA: No, they're in Trostenwald.

03:16:08.233 --> 03:16:14.294
SAM: Why would we be claiming something here? We
need to be claiming from a family that's here.

03:16:14.294 --> 03:16:17.307
MARISHA: Timalt is from here, right?

03:16:17.307 --> 03:16:18.935
MATT: Timalts are in Zadash.

03:16:18.935 --> 03:16:21.769
MARISHA: They are in Zadash. They made a
shipment.

03:16:21.769 --> 03:16:26.059
TRAVIS: If the High-Richter doesn't say, "You're
right, this is injustice, let's take it to the

03:16:26.059 --> 03:16:29.322
Lawmaster," then that Richter sucks.

03:16:31.482 --> 03:16:34.208
LIAM: She could be a lazy ass.

03:16:34.332 --> 03:16:38.813
MARISHA: Regardless, it's just a story so we can
get a bead on her, right?

03:16:38.883 --> 03:16:40.899
LIAM: Sure.

03:16:40.899 --> 03:16:45.353
LAURA: What if we say, "We're from the Timalt
Company, they never paid our invoice, and they

03:16:45.353 --> 03:16:47.379
stole our puppies!"

03:16:47.379 --> 03:16:48.678
MARISHA: That's not bad.

03:16:48.678 --> 03:16:50.723
TRAVIS: Puppy crime.

03:16:50.723 --> 03:16:55.989
LAURA: That's how we would know that it was a bad
guy. Okay.

03:16:55.989 --> 03:17:00.909
TRAVIS: So they stole from our invoice and they
took all our Saint Bernard puppies.

03:17:00.909 --> 03:17:02.924
LAURA: Yes, and it is very sad.

03:17:02.924 --> 03:17:04.281
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:17:04.281 --> 03:17:07.341
MARISHA: What time is it?

03:17:07.341 --> 03:17:10.168
MATT: It's mid-morning. 10:00.

03:17:10.168 --> 03:17:11.963
TRAVIS: What time, exactly, of the day?

03:17:11.963 --> 03:17:13.712
MATT: 10:13 a.m.

03:17:14.562 --> 03:17:16.105
LIAM: Caleb said.

03:17:18.137 --> 03:17:23.924
MARISHA: Is it early enough to where, on my way
there, I can pick up my custom coat?

03:17:23.924 --> 03:17:25.312
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

03:17:25.312 --> 03:17:27.221
MARISHA: Okay.

03:17:27.221 --> 03:17:30.227
TALIESIN: Especially since it just rained, so the
sewer will be really damp.

03:17:30.227 --> 03:17:31.610
TRAVIS: Oh, god!

03:17:31.610 --> 03:17:33.120
MARISHA: Are we trying to go through the sewer?

03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:34.282
TRAVIS: Yeah, we have to.

03:17:34.282 --> 03:17:36.032
LAURA: To get all of us through.

03:17:36.032 --> 03:17:38.609
TRAVIS: Well, let's pick up your cloak and make
our way.

03:17:38.609 --> 03:17:40.543
TALIESIN: Do we still have the writ, or is the
writ gone?

03:17:40.543 --> 03:17:41.722
MATT: The writ was retrieved.

03:17:41.722 --> 03:17:43.773
TALIESIN: Never mind, that's fine.

03:17:43.773 --> 03:17:49.834
MARISHA: We can still find the back sewer entrance,
have Nott pop the lock, and we know how to go.

03:17:50.230 --> 03:17:53.053
TRAVIS: Why didn't we try to forge a writ, 
damn it?

03:17:53.053 --> 03:17:55.589
LAURA: Who all can make disguises for themselves?

03:17:57.599 --> 03:18:01.088
TALIESIN: Oh! I can figure it out.

03:18:01.135 --> 03:18:03.616
MARISHA: With my coat, kind of-ish?

03:18:03.616 --> 03:18:05.620
LAURA: You can cover up your face, at least.

03:18:05.620 --> 03:18:13.109
MATT: Mmkay, so you guys make your way back to the
same sewer entrance where you originally embarked

03:18:13.109 --> 03:18:19.365
below. There are two crownsguard in the vicinity,
they're keeping watch of that intersection, just

03:18:19.365 --> 03:18:23.834
like they were last time. They haven't noticed
your approach yet, but they are keeping an eye.

03:18:28.434 --> 03:18:30.575
MARISHA: We're going to have to distract them.

03:18:30.608 --> 03:18:33.085
TRAVIS: I could have one of them beat the shit out
of the other one.

03:18:33.085 --> 03:18:33.978
TALIESIN: Oh!

03:18:33.978 --> 03:18:34.856
LAURA: Why?

03:18:34.856 --> 03:18:39.101
TRAVIS: Let's do that. I cast Crown of Madness on
one of the guards.

03:18:39.101 --> 03:18:41.412
TALIESIN: That's not going to go poorly.

03:18:41.412 --> 03:18:43.958
MARISHA: Yes! So into this!

03:18:43.958 --> 03:18:45.354
MATT: Okay!

03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:48.089
TRAVIS: Hopefully from an area where they don't
see me casting it.

03:18:48.089 --> 03:18:49.465
MATT: Make a stealth check.

03:18:49.465 --> 03:18:50.639
TRAVIS: Oh no!

03:18:50.878 --> 03:18:53.133
LAURA: Blessing of the Trickster! Advantage!

03:18:53.133 --> 03:18:54.173
TRAVIS: 14!

03:18:54.300 --> 03:18:56.036
MATT: All righty.

03:18:58.135 --> 03:19:01.628
TRAVIS: Oh, I have advantage? Nah.

03:19:01.628 --> 03:19:03.236
TALIESIN: 14!

03:19:09.625 --> 03:19:16.726
MATT: As you hide off on the side, you focus and
then concentrate on one of the two crownsguard. As

03:19:16.726 --> 03:19:21.774
the magic begins to slowly filter around the
outside of the face, the brief little motes of

03:19:21.774 --> 03:19:25.236
shadow begin to be plucked from the space and
gather around the outside of its head.

03:19:25.236 --> 03:19:31.942
Unknowingly-- what's your spell DC? That's a ten.
It's higher than ten, I'm pretty sure.

03:19:31.942 --> 03:19:35.004
TRAVIS: Yes, it is! 14.

03:19:35.004 --> 03:19:42.824
MATT: All of a sudden, the guard (grunts) and
you watch as these motes fit faintly around the

03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:49.322
outside, like this floating crown on the top of
the head. You force him to attack the other?

03:19:49.322 --> 03:19:52.122
TRAVIS: Kick his ass, sea bass.

03:19:52.817 --> 03:20:00.518
MATT: The guard (grunts) grabs his blade, runs
forward. The other guard is like, "Hey, what--

03:20:00.518 --> 03:20:06.802
oh!" (screams) Pulls his shield up. "What's going
on?! David, what the fuck are you doing?!"

03:20:06.802 --> 03:20:09.661
TRAVIS: Nott! Quick, let the lock on the sewer
thing, let's go!

03:20:09.661 --> 03:20:11.183
SAM: Oh, I'm doing something?

03:20:11.183 --> 03:20:12.761
LAURA: No, we don't have to, it's not locked.

03:20:12.761 --> 03:20:13.687
SAM: What are we doing?

03:20:13.687 --> 03:20:14.913
TRAVIS: I thought it was locked!

03:20:14.913 --> 03:20:16.083
LIAM: Let's find out!

03:20:16.083 --> 03:20:18.486
MATT: It's going to make another save. It's a two,
it's still holding.

03:20:18.592 --> 03:20:20.146
MARISHA: Is the sewer locked?

03:20:20.146 --> 03:20:21.539
MATT: The gate? It is locked.

03:20:21.539 --> 03:20:22.938
SAM: Okay, then I'll pick it!

03:20:22.938 --> 03:20:26.479
MATT: Everyone's attention right now is directly
on this as one crownsguard is attacking the other.

03:20:26.757 --> 03:20:27.969
SAM: What am I doing?

03:20:27.969 --> 03:20:29.030
MATT: It's plus six.

03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:30.699
SAM: Seven. No, nine.

03:20:30.699 --> 03:20:33.266
MATT: Nine. It's not coming off, it's not
opening!

03:20:33.266 --> 03:20:34.882
SAM: Break it!

03:20:34.882 --> 03:20:41.852
MATT: He attacks the other guard, he's screaming,
"Get help!" No, it's an 11. What's your spell DC?

03:20:41.852 --> 03:20:42.788
TRAVIS: 14!

03:20:42.788 --> 03:20:45.532
LAURA: I try to break the gate, I try to pull the
gate! I'm trying to pull it open.

03:20:45.532 --> 03:20:48.732
MATT: Make a strength check. Roll a d20, add your
strength modifier.

03:20:50.332 --> 03:20:51.936
LAURA: Oh, 17!

03:20:51.936 --> 03:20:56.399
MATT: (ping) You actually break it with your bare
hands, leaving an opening.

03:20:56.562 --> 03:20:57.918
LAURA: Go, go, go!

03:20:57.918 --> 03:20:58.833
TRAVIS: Everybody in!

03:20:58.833 --> 03:21:02.328
MATT: There's a scream starting to happen, you
guys start running in, one after another. Guard

03:21:02.328 --> 03:21:05.471
gets one more saving throw. 13, what's your--?

03:21:05.471 --> 03:21:06.757
TRAVIS: 14!

03:21:06.757 --> 03:21:13.588
MATT: 14?! Shit! The other guard is now wrestling
him to the ground, and he's trying to hold him to

03:21:13.588 --> 03:21:18.732
the ground. "What the fuck?!" You hear screams
going off around now this ruckus is gathering in

03:21:18.863 --> 03:21:22.503
the center as people are starting to yell. You can
hear in the distance other crownsguard yelling and

03:21:22.503 --> 03:21:26.742
starting to gather in the middle of this chaos as
you all get down in the sewer, and pull it shut.

03:21:27.742 --> 03:21:29.749
MARISHA: That was awesome!

03:21:29.857 --> 03:21:31.363
TRAVIS: Yeah, I might've fucked that thing up.

03:21:31.363 --> 03:21:32.321
LAURA: Keep going!

03:21:32.321 --> 03:21:35.640
LIAM: We're going to be quiet in the sewers
because there's things down here.

03:21:35.640 --> 03:21:38.081
LAURA: Oh yeah, avoid all the rat balloons!

03:21:38.081 --> 03:21:40.569
LIAM: They were everywhere the last time.

03:21:40.569 --> 03:21:45.666
MATT: You hear all the ruckus up there, echoing
down inside and other footsteps coming through and

03:21:45.666 --> 03:21:51.609
you hear this guy going, "I am so sorry, I don't
know what was happening! Ow, that hurts! I don't

03:21:51.609 --> 03:21:57.302
know what's--" and you hear he's being held to the
ground now, and people are shouting and, oh man.

03:21:57.302 --> 03:21:59.008
MARISHA: Ooh, that guy is definitely arrested.

03:21:59.008 --> 03:22:01.810
MATT: That guy's going to have a bad day!

03:22:01.810 --> 03:22:05.276
TRAVIS: He might get demoted, a couple day's pay.

03:22:05.276 --> 03:22:08.637
LIAM: He is going to be about 12 inches shorter.

03:22:08.637 --> 03:22:11.231
TRAVIS: No, come on!

03:22:12.611 --> 03:22:15.138
MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check, guys.

03:22:16.391 --> 03:22:17.904
All of you guys make a stealth check.

03:22:17.904 --> 03:22:20.715
LAURA: You still have the blessing. Does anybody
else need a blessing?

03:22:20.715 --> 03:22:23.769
MARISHA: We're all rolling stealth?

03:22:24.885 --> 03:22:26.266
TRAVIS: Ten.

03:22:26.266 --> 03:22:27.350
TALIESIN: Ten.

03:22:27.350 --> 03:22:28.269
LAURA: Seven.

03:22:28.269 --> 03:22:29.062
SAM: 22.

03:22:29.062 --> 03:22:29.586
LIAM: 20.

03:22:29.586 --> 03:22:30.555
MARISHA: 22.

03:22:30.555 --> 03:22:34.305
MATT: Okay. At a mass majority, you do slip around
the same area where you had the original

03:22:34.305 --> 03:22:39.475
confrontation, you do see some more of those rats
scattered about, but you manage to quickly dart

03:22:39.475 --> 03:22:44.844
by. In a few moments, you hear a (hiss) turn as
they notice something, but they go in the

03:22:44.844 --> 03:22:48.806
direction, as you go in to move past. Some of them
shift in where you were but no longer where you

03:22:48.806 --> 03:22:53.562
are. The blind rats are going by the sound and
being misled a bit, so you manage to maneuver

03:22:53.562 --> 03:22:58.401
around without any immediate conflict. Eventually,
you make your way back to where those webs were

03:22:58.401 --> 03:23:03.827
situated before the phase spider's little domain
there at the edge. Still in tatters, untouched from

03:23:03.827 --> 03:23:10.005
where you left it. You head back to the rung and
you can see the entranceway into the Tri-Spire District.

03:23:11.439 --> 03:23:14.909
TRAVIS: Did not think about what to do once we got
into this part of the plan.

03:23:14.909 --> 03:23:18.784
SAM: We need to disguise ourselves.

03:23:18.784 --> 03:23:20.383
TRAVIS: Right, yeah.

03:23:20.383 --> 03:23:27.781
SAM: Then we go up there and then find out where
the Richter lives and then pitch our really

03:23:27.781 --> 03:23:34.026
ill-thought out plan to them. This is going to be
great.

03:23:34.026 --> 03:23:41.604
TRAVIS: Yeah! I cast Disguise Self. Very long
black cloak with gold trim, like a nice trim

03:23:41.604 --> 03:23:50.943
goatee and slicked back jet black hair. Piercing
blue eyes, nice looking human.

03:23:50.943 --> 03:23:57.128
MARISHA: Can I take the brown side of my newly
purchased reversible coat, take out my Brewer's

03:23:57.128 --> 03:24:01.376
Kit that I have, and take a few of the bottles and
fashion them to my waist a little bit?

03:24:05.296 --> 03:24:10.954
SAM: Disguise Self. Same exact thing as Fjord,
except longer hair, shorter mustache.

03:24:12.278 --> 03:24:14.347
MATT: Perfect!

03:24:14.373 --> 03:24:16.661
TRAVIS: Cloak, gold trim?

03:24:16.661 --> 03:24:22.634
SAM: Yeah, everything. Shorter, but female, just a
little outline for the mustache.

03:24:22.634 --> 03:24:27.222
MATT: You're like the pallbearer to the undertaker
of Fjord.

03:24:27.222 --> 03:24:29.103
TRAVIS: Great analogy!

03:24:29.103 --> 03:24:33.665
MATT: Thank you! Anybody else making any effort or
are you just doing your thing?

03:24:33.665 --> 03:24:41.246
LAURA: I'm going to cast Disguise Self and I'm
going to be tan, short, elven woman in a royal

03:24:41.246 --> 03:24:48.943
blue lace dress, very similar to the one the lady
was wearing, with the cut out. And soft medium

03:24:48.943 --> 03:24:51.745
hair, pulled back in waves.

03:24:51.745 --> 03:24:54.425
TALIESIN: I'm going to put the hood up and stay in
the back.

03:24:54.425 --> 03:24:56.419
MATT: Okay.

03:24:56.419 --> 03:25:02.895
LIAM: I make myself look like the male version of
the elven woman that Jester did in a similar high

03:25:02.895 --> 03:25:05.308
collared clothing.

03:25:05.308 --> 03:25:08.399
MATT: Perfect. This is great.

03:25:08.399 --> 03:25:10.519
TRAVIS: Fated to do well.

03:25:10.519 --> 03:25:14.438
SAM: We're a normal family!

03:25:16.795 --> 03:25:21.480
MATT: The moment you climb up the top-- did you
leave it locked? Did you lock it behind you as

03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:22.705
you--

03:25:22.705 --> 03:25:24.128
SAM: I don't know, you tell me.

03:25:24.128 --> 03:25:25.399
LAURA: No, we didn't. I don't think we did.

03:25:25.399 --> 03:25:28.067
MATT: I think you left it unlocked. It wouldn't
have been a huge issue. You're not in danger.

03:25:28.067 --> 03:25:31.435
We'll say you left it unlocked because you
intended to possibly use it again in the future.

03:25:31.435 --> 03:25:36.400
You head back, push the two pipes, and you all
climb back into the alleyway. You are now in the

03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:38.170
Tri-Spire district.

03:25:38.170 --> 03:25:44.872
MARISHA: Awesome. Okay, let's ask around and find
where this Richter lives.

03:25:44.872 --> 03:25:51.318
MATT: Walking around the city, you see a few
crownsguard wandering the streets, they

03:25:51.318 --> 03:26:00.076
occasionally put a glance to not recognize you
wandering, but don't pay immediate attention. You

03:26:00.076 --> 03:26:09.862
do see one gentleman, early 60s or so, who's
wearing this nice frilled shirt with heavy brass

03:26:09.862 --> 03:26:16.407
buttons down the front with this potbelly that's
tucked in with a belt, breeches that go past the

03:26:16.407 --> 03:26:22.465
knee before his boots hit, and he's walking in the
street, strutting a bit, looking up. He's the

03:26:22.465 --> 03:26:25.901
first person you see that crosses your path that
looks like they probably know the vicinity.

03:26:25.901 --> 03:26:29.907
SAM: Want me to go talk to him?

03:26:30.833 --> 03:26:32.947
TRAVIS: Hello sir, excuse me.

03:26:32.947 --> 03:26:34.493
MATT: "Yes, can I help you?"

03:26:34.493 --> 03:26:37.917
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to bother you, we have business
with the High-Richter. Is there a chance that you

03:26:37.917 --> 03:26:40.688
could point us in his direction-- her direction.

03:26:40.688 --> 03:26:48.838
MATT: "Well, that is the High-Richter's estate. I
do not know if she is home. She may be at the

03:26:48.838 --> 03:26:50.295
King's Hall."

03:26:50.295 --> 03:26:53.397
TRAVIS: I really don't care, we're just delivering
a parcel.

03:26:53.492 --> 03:27:01.308
MATT: "Very well. Let's see. Dayana's estate is
right around that way." He points. You see that he

03:27:01.308 --> 03:27:07.080
has this thin, white John Waters mustache across
the top that turns into this light goatee right at

03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:15.298
the tip of the chin. As he points over, you can
see, "Right on the outskirts of the Gilded

03:27:15.298 --> 03:27:20.173
Willows-- that one." He points again.

03:27:20.173 --> 03:27:22.316
TRAVIS: Wonderful, thank you for your time.

03:27:22.316 --> 03:27:25.740
MATT: "It was my pleasure." He continues walking
on his way.

03:27:25.740 --> 03:27:28.483
LAURA: I walk like him.

03:27:31.793 --> 03:27:34.558
TRAVIS: Nott, your mustache is much nicer.

03:27:35.632 --> 03:27:38.657
SAM: Thank you, honey.

03:27:39.426 --> 03:27:45.310
TRAVIS: Do you know what a mime is? You just mime
this mission.

03:27:45.310 --> 03:27:59.862
SAM: Okay. There's a fierce wind, I've got to--!
Oh no! I'm in a box! Oh no! The box is getting

03:27:59.862 --> 03:28:05.020
smaller! Don't worry, I'll climb out!

03:28:05.197 --> 03:28:11.857
LIAM: Nott, what Fjord is implying is-- you know
how I can make myself look like anything?

03:28:11.857 --> 03:28:13.091
SAM: I'm not an idiot!

03:28:13.091 --> 03:28:15.962
(laughter)

03:28:16.793 --> 03:28:18.509
LIAM: Okay.

03:28:22.627 --> 03:28:28.067
MATT: Approaching the homestead that was pointed
out by that gentleman earlier, the homestead is

03:28:28.067 --> 03:28:33.513
surrounded by a seven-foot tall stone and mortar
wall that tightly crowds the perimeter. This is

03:28:33.513 --> 03:28:44.108
only maybe a three-foot space between the wall and
the actual home. You see that the two-story home

03:28:44.108 --> 03:28:50.954
is painted in a forest green color on the outside
of the wood and stone built structure. You can see

03:28:50.954 --> 03:28:56.903
that there is a front archway to the door that
goes beyond the wall. There is a small gate.

03:28:57.002 --> 03:29:00.739
Beyond that, there is the front door to the estate
where there is a stationed crownsguard.

03:29:02.539 --> 03:29:05.363
LAURA: This looks really well fortified.

03:29:05.565 --> 03:29:08.672
SAM: We're just going to walk up and ask for--

03:29:08.672 --> 03:29:13.527
TRAVIS: Ask for an audience, yeah. Maybe if we say
that we were sent by the Lawmaster, for the

03:29:13.527 --> 03:29:16.212
High-Richter to make a ruling.

03:29:16.212 --> 03:29:24.358
SAM: Should we leave anyone out to be ready to
help if anything goes wrong?

03:29:24.358 --> 03:29:26.898
TRAVIS: Good instinct, what do you think?

03:29:26.898 --> 03:29:29.278
SAM: I don't know. Caleb, what do you think?

03:29:29.278 --> 03:29:33.888
LIAM: Well, you're always good to have hidden away
in case something goes squirrely. So definitely

03:29:33.888 --> 03:29:35.535
you. Maybe me as well.

03:29:35.675 --> 03:29:36.800
SAM: Maybe.

03:29:36.800 --> 03:29:38.337
LIAM: Yeah.

03:29:38.337 --> 03:29:40.180
TRAVIS: Jester, I'd like you to come.

03:29:40.180 --> 03:29:43.223
LAURA: I want to come. (with an accent) I want to
come.

03:29:43.223 --> 03:29:46.325
TRAVIS: Nice. Molly, what do you want to do?

03:29:46.325 --> 03:29:50.857
TALIESIN: I think I am a very reasonable personal
assistant to anyone who is trying to make a deal.

03:29:50.857 --> 03:29:53.911
TRAVIS: Indeed. What would your name be in this
situation?

03:29:53.911 --> 03:29:55.686
TALIESIN: Do we have to have names?

03:29:55.686 --> 03:29:58.042
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to think ahead.

03:29:58.042 --> 03:30:02.196
TALIESIN: Well, fine. Erikson.

03:30:02.196 --> 03:30:03.747
TRAVIS: Lovely.

03:30:03.747 --> 03:30:07.443
MARISHA: Lawrence is great. Worked for me before.

03:30:07.443 --> 03:30:08.883
TRAVIS: Lawrence?

03:30:08.883 --> 03:30:12.065
MARISHA: Actually, no. Let's do something else,
considering I already used Lawrence once.

03:30:12.065 --> 03:30:15.412
SAM: It's just a fucking name, pick anything!
Sorry.

03:30:15.412 --> 03:30:18.370
(laughter)

03:30:22.905 --> 03:30:25.025
TALIESIN: Do you need a drink?

03:30:25.712 --> 03:30:29.052
SAM: Yes, I do. I had a terrible night last
night.

03:30:29.052 --> 03:30:30.908
LAURA: How about Marge?

03:30:30.908 --> 03:30:39.520
MARISHA: Francis. Francis Titmalt-- Timalt, not
Titmalt.

03:30:39.520 --> 03:30:45.243
TRAVIS: Are you staying out here with Nott, Caleb,
or are you going to come in? If we make it in.

03:30:45.243 --> 03:30:52.761
LIAM: If you make it in? No, I'm going to stay
with Nott. I will be back-up. You're a good

03:30:52.761 --> 03:30:55.529
talker. We don't need two good talkers.

03:30:55.529 --> 03:30:57.632
SAM: What about the cat?

03:30:57.632 --> 03:30:59.866
LIAM: Yeah. Oh, cat?

03:30:59.866 --> 03:31:01.834
SAM: How will we know what's going on inside?

03:31:01.834 --> 03:31:04.948
LAURA: They don't like cats here in the
Tri-Spire.

03:31:06.531 --> 03:31:12.930
LIAM: I think that we're hidden away in case
things go bad with the crownsguard. After that

03:31:12.930 --> 03:31:15.465
then they're on their own, I think.

03:31:15.465 --> 03:31:19.346
TRAVIS: That's right. Wish us luck.

03:31:19.346 --> 03:31:20.522
MARISHA: Let's go.

03:31:20.522 --> 03:31:23.371
TRAVIS: I walk up to one of the two crownsguard
outside the door.

03:31:23.658 --> 03:31:25.451
LAURA: I follow behind him.

03:31:25.451 --> 03:31:27.530
MARISHA: Super official.

03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:29.570
LIAM: Be careful, twinnie.

03:31:29.570 --> 03:31:34.889
MATT: There is actually only one crownsguard at
the front door, behind the gate. As you approach,

03:31:34.889 --> 03:31:36.267
arms crossed--

03:31:38.961 --> 03:31:43.742
TRAVIS: "Yes, please, look lively, unfortunately
we've been sent here from the Lawmaster, we have

03:31:43.742 --> 03:31:50.979
some very urgent business with High-Richter
Prucine. Please, if you wouldn't mind, would you

03:31:50.979 --> 03:31:52.268
fetch her?"

03:31:52.268 --> 03:31:53.680
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:31:58.340 --> 03:32:00.458
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:32:00.458 --> 03:32:11.643
MATT: Glad you fixed that. The guard goes, "Oh,
I-- Just a second," goes and opens the door,

03:32:11.643 --> 03:32:21.174
leaning inside. "High-Richter, you have guests out
front." A voice goes, "Tell them to wait a moment."

03:32:22.304 --> 03:32:24.412
LAURA: I like her already.

03:32:24.783 --> 03:32:31.813
MATT: A moment passes. The crownsguard steps out
of the way and you see emerge from the doorway an

03:32:31.813 --> 03:32:39.426
older female half-elf with dark red-purple hair
that is short on the sides and brushed to one

03:32:39.426 --> 03:32:47.645
side, almost to a point. She has a gaunt, angular
appearance, and is in the process of putting on

03:32:47.645 --> 03:32:55.454
ceremonial gold and white armor, similar to what
you had seen on the Herald of the Hall, but a more

03:32:55.454 --> 03:33:00.715
elaborate design, and taken from the process of
buckling together a brace. She walks up and goes,

03:33:00.715 --> 03:33:04.724
"All right, now who's here for their time with me?"

03:33:04.914 --> 03:33:08.129
TRAVIS: Oh, High-Richter, it's so lovely to see
you again. I know it's been quite a while.

03:33:08.129 --> 03:33:10.258
MATT: "I have no idea who you are."

03:33:10.258 --> 03:33:14.520
TRAVIS: Brantley. We met-- must have been years ago
now. You remember the Gala.

03:33:14.719 --> 03:33:18.351
MARISHA: I think it was a fundraiser, last time
you were up for election?

03:33:18.351 --> 03:33:20.562
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:33:23.657 --> 03:33:26.542
TRAVIS: Yeah! 14 plus four, 18.

03:33:26.542 --> 03:33:34.326
MATT: "Yes, of course, I recall. It's been some
time. What brings you to the front of my homestead

03:33:34.326 --> 03:33:38.539
in the middle of the day? I'm on my way to the
Hall."

03:33:38.735 --> 03:33:44.326
TRAVIS: I understand. A bit of terrible business,
actually. Our family has been unfortunately at the

03:33:44.326 --> 03:33:50.363
poor end of some corporate espionage, and I'm
afraid the Baumbauchs, isn't that who they are in

03:33:50.363 --> 03:33:51.706
Trostenwald?

03:33:51.706 --> 03:33:52.980
LAURA: Terrible evil, the Baumbauchs.

03:33:52.980 --> 03:33:54.782
MARISHA: Especially that Demedan.

03:33:54.782 --> 03:34:00.570
TRAVIS: Just a wretched fellow. They've made off
with quite a bit of our product, and we have some

03:34:00.570 --> 03:34:04.809
evidence against them. We tried to take it to the
Lawmaster, of course, we didn't want to trouble

03:34:04.809 --> 03:34:05.664
you, but--

03:34:05.664 --> 03:34:12.741
MARISHA: She directed us here, we thought, well,
Dayana is just so sweet, she would of course help

03:34:12.741 --> 03:34:13.600
us out.

03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:14.759
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

03:34:14.759 --> 03:34:21.925
MARISHA: Here is the invoice from the amount due
that they have not paid from the Timalt Store House.

03:34:21.949 --> 03:34:26.275
TRAVIS: I'm sure justice will be swift, but
unfortunately, much of our family's finances are

03:34:26.275 --> 03:34:27.470
wrapped up in this.

03:34:27.470 --> 03:34:29.256
LAURA: And they took our puppies.

03:34:30.974 --> 03:34:34.480
MATT: I would like both of you to make deception
checks, please.

03:34:34.480 --> 03:34:39.962
LIAM: Caleb is turning the diamond over and over
in his hand like a fidget spinner, watching all of this.

03:34:40.237 --> 03:34:41.894
TRAVIS: At least you have the diamond, right?

03:34:41.894 --> 03:34:46.492
MARISHA: Oh my god, what should I roll? Give me
something good. That's not too bad. 15.

03:34:46.492 --> 03:34:47.772
LAURA: Six.

03:34:47.772 --> 03:35:03.771
MATT: She goes, "Puppies, I'm sure. Well,
Baumbauch is outside of the Zadash jurisdiction.

03:35:03.771 --> 03:35:12.214
That is Trostenwald territory. I'm afraid that is
not something I would nor could handle if I wanted

03:35:12.214 --> 03:35:18.977
to. If you wish to bring them to justice either
present your evidence to the lawmaster of

03:35:18.977 --> 03:35:24.723
Trostenwald, or bring Baumbauch to me. Otherwise,
I have no interest."

03:35:24.723 --> 03:35:29.569
TRAVIS: I'm sure you can understand our situation.
We have already done that exact thing! We wouldn't

03:35:29.569 --> 03:35:32.930
waste your time with such rudimentary worries,
but–

03:35:32.930 --> 03:35:35.591
MATT: "Then why are you wasting my time right
now?"

03:35:35.591 --> 03:35:39.181
TRAVIS: Well, frankly, the Lawmaster in
Trostenwald seemed to show you very little respect

03:35:39.181 --> 03:35:44.627
when we mentioned your name, and being that our
family is so influential around here, we're going

03:35:44.627 --> 03:35:49.753
to be tossed to the wayside if justice isn't
found. Surely you understand that.

03:35:49.753 --> 03:35:56.062
MARISHA: And, of course, we would happily pay you
for any type of additional services you might be

03:35:56.062 --> 03:35:59.123
able to help us out with.

03:35:59.144 --> 03:36:06.788
MATT: "Am I– step inside." The crownsguard step
inside and close the door behind. "Am I to

03:36:06.992 --> 03:36:13.163
understand that you've come out here in broad
daylight to my estate in an attempt to bribe the

03:36:13.163 --> 03:36:14.824
High-Richter of Zadash?"

03:36:14.824 --> 03:36:17.079
TRAVIS: Was that what you said?

03:36:17.079 --> 03:36:20.834
MARISHA: No, I don't think those were my words at
all. No.

03:36:20.834 --> 03:36:24.627
TRAVIS: It was merely a few pennies for your
time.

03:36:24.627 --> 03:36:26.329
LAURA: A favor for a favor!

03:36:26.329 --> 03:36:31.728
TRAVIS: Yes, I mean certainly if you feel like
doing justice on its own– I would like to see

03:36:31.728 --> 03:36:33.989
people taken care of that take care of us.

03:36:33.989 --> 03:36:36.321
MATT: "So long as it's not a bribe. Favors we can
do."

03:36:36.321 --> 03:36:37.647
TRAVIS: Well, of course!

03:36:37.647 --> 03:36:47.026
MATT: "I'll see what's possible. I'll ask around.
I'll take these documents, if you don't mind, to

03:36:47.026 --> 03:36:48.978
see what can be mustered."

03:36:48.978 --> 03:36:52.444
MARISHA: And, of course, we are always willing to
repay in favors.

03:36:52.451 --> 03:36:59.818
MATT: "Of course. There are all sides and types of
favors that can be helpful to the Crown and those

03:36:59.818 --> 03:37:00.908
below."

03:37:00.908 --> 03:37:04.534
LAURA: Also, what do you think of puppies?

03:37:06.934 --> 03:37:14.831
MATT: "I think they're droll and must be fed to
their larger kin. So are we done here?"

03:37:15.297 --> 03:37:22.757
TRAVIS: Yes, I believe we are. Thank you for your
time. We're most gracious.

03:37:22.757 --> 03:37:24.696
MATT: "I'm certain it has been."

03:37:24.696 --> 03:37:28.962
MARISHA: While he wraps it up, can I do a quick
glance over her table or over her desk to see if I

03:37:28.962 --> 03:37:31.475
see any type of papers?

03:37:31.475 --> 03:37:33.310
MATT: Well, this is on the front doorstep.

03:37:33.492 --> 03:37:35.183
MARISHA: Oh, I thought she pulled us inside. I'm
sorry.

03:37:35.183 --> 03:37:36.763
MATT: No, she pulled the crownsguard inside.

03:37:36.763 --> 03:37:41.163
TRAVIS: But since we're inside of that seven-foot
wall: windows, doors, security measures, how many

03:37:41.163 --> 03:37:42.126
floors?

03:37:42.126 --> 03:37:50.132
MATT: From the immediate front position, there is
the door itself beyond the archway, two small

03:37:50.132 --> 03:37:56.374
windows to each side of it, though it appears that
they're closed, and they're bisected with wooden

03:37:56.374 --> 03:37:58.014
beams between.

03:37:58.014 --> 03:38:00.336
TRAVIS: Shuttered? Wooden shuttered closed?

03:38:00.336 --> 03:38:05.792
MATT: They are shuttered, yeah, from the inside.
You'd open them from the inside to bring in the

03:38:05.792 --> 03:38:11.137
light, but they're currently closed. The second
floor above you do see one balcony. It's a bit

03:38:11.137 --> 03:38:16.462
receded and there's a balcony that looks out over
it all with a second set of doors, but that is

03:38:16.462 --> 03:38:17.690
currently closed.

03:38:18.114 --> 03:38:19.299
MARISHA: Okay.

03:38:19.299 --> 03:38:26.427
TALIESIN: While we're bowing on our way out, I'm
going to drop my waterskin and spill it.

03:38:26.427 --> 03:38:27.854
MATT: Okay.

03:38:30.524 --> 03:38:32.303
LAURA: Erikson!

03:38:32.508 --> 03:38:34.811
TALIESIN: Oh! I'm so sorry, my lord.

03:38:34.811 --> 03:38:36.810
LAURA: Every time! Every time!

03:38:36.810 --> 03:38:43.303
TALIESIN: As I'm cleaning it up, I'm going to make
eye contact just briefly. What do I see?

03:38:47.853 --> 03:38:54.413
I was curious what the reaction to this ridiculous
creature is spilling shit all over her front lawn.

03:38:54.413 --> 03:38:56.020
That's all.

03:38:56.047 --> 03:38:58.639
MATT: Oh, I got you. I follow you now.

03:38:58.639 --> 03:38:59.849
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:38:59.849 --> 03:39:10.116
MATT: There is an immediate bit of a scowl and, "I
would also ask nicely if you'll stop bringing

03:39:10.116 --> 03:39:13.713
these demon bloods onto my estate to be
ruining--"

03:39:13.713 --> 03:39:16.430
MARISHA: That's what we were looking for this
whole time.

03:39:16.430 --> 03:39:19.631
LAURA: Like the puppy thing wasn't enough? Come
on!

03:39:19.631 --> 03:39:23.789
TRAVIS: I mean, they're kicking cats in this
bitch, so it's not that far off.

03:39:23.789 --> 03:39:28.493
TALIESIN: A thousand apologies, my lord, I'll take
your sister and make sure she gets her medicine.

03:39:28.493 --> 03:39:30.420
TRAVIS: You embarrass me!

03:39:31.880 --> 03:39:34.373
LAURA: How dare you, Erickson!

03:39:34.373 --> 03:39:39.720
TRAVIS: Please make sure she's beaten as you lead
her away. I apologize for his fuddy-duddyness.

03:39:39.905 --> 03:39:42.182
MARISHA: It's hard to find good help these days.

03:39:42.182 --> 03:39:46.099
TRAVIS: Thank you for your time. Good day.

03:39:46.099 --> 03:39:48.907
MATT: She turns around wordlessly and goes inside
and slams the door.

03:39:48.907 --> 03:39:50.543
MARISHA: Go, guys. Let's go.

03:39:50.543 --> 03:39:54.027
TALIESIN: There's easy ways to find out if people
are terrible or not.

03:39:54.027 --> 03:40:01.680
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was good. Well, we walk a fair
distance away from the crownsguard and we see

03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:04.033
Caleb and little pallbearer.

03:40:05.573 --> 03:40:10.180
SAM: Did, they-- oh. Hi, honey!

03:40:12.289 --> 03:40:15.277
TRAVIS: Like a small Morticia Addams.

03:40:15.753 --> 03:40:17.363
LAURA: With a mustache.

03:40:17.782 --> 03:40:19.571
LIAM: So we've got it buttoned down.

03:40:19.571 --> 03:40:25.459
SAM: Did she offer to kill a bunch of innocents or
anything?

03:40:25.459 --> 03:40:28.704
TRAVIS: Well, I mean she said that dogs should be
fed to the larger ones.

03:40:28.704 --> 03:40:31.311
LAURA: And she said that tieflings were terrible.

03:40:31.311 --> 03:40:35.691
SAM: Okay, devil's advocate, here: I really don't
like dogs either.

03:40:35.691 --> 03:40:39.304
LAURA: Yeah, but puppies, Nott, puppies.

03:40:39.304 --> 03:40:41.353
SAM: Yeah, they make great food.

03:40:41.353 --> 03:40:43.321
LAURA: Nott!

03:40:43.321 --> 03:40:49.127
SAM: When you're out in the woods and that's all
that you have to eat, they have very tender meat!

03:40:49.127 --> 03:40:56.135
And, to be fair, (whispering) Mollymauk is a
little bit of, I mean, I wouldn't trust him either.

03:40:56.338 --> 03:41:02.845
TRAVIS: Right, but imagine if she had gotten her
eyes on you. I mean, don't know what she would

03:41:02.845 --> 03:41:04.459
have done.

03:41:04.459 --> 03:41:07.534
SAM: Well, that would make her the same as 95
percent of people in this city.

03:41:07.534 --> 03:41:08.873
TRAVIS: But that means she's got to die.

03:41:08.873 --> 03:41:12.071
SAM: Okay, that's true.

03:41:12.071 --> 03:41:16.169
LIAM: We are not going bring this woman's life
down in a shambles because she is an asshole, I

03:41:16.169 --> 03:41:20.866
mean, we are assholes. <i>Ja</i>? For different
reasons.

03:41:21.470 --> 03:41:23.937
MARISHA: But we're assholes without power, though.

03:41:23.937 --> 03:41:26.388
LIAM: Okay. And?

03:41:26.388 --> 03:41:29.907
MARISHA: I don't know, it's less dangerous? I
don't know.

03:41:29.907 --> 03:41:35.745
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you notice that the streets themselves have long

03:41:35.745 --> 03:41:41.080
silken streamers that are affixed from light pole
to light pole as part of the decoration along the

03:41:41.080 --> 03:41:47.055
streets, but you see additional decorations being
put up. You see bunches of flowers being affixed

03:41:47.055 --> 03:41:51.821
to the top of these poles, you can see more
streamers of multiple colors being placed around a

03:41:51.821 --> 03:41:56.627
center courtyard, in one of the mid-areas of the
Silken Terrace.

03:41:57.474 --> 03:42:00.267
TALIESIN: Must be some sort of harvest theme that
everything is going up.

03:42:00.267 --> 03:42:01.338
LAURA: Yes.

03:42:01.338 --> 03:42:06.230
MARISHA: It's that harvest fest. Remember, there's
another tournament and stuff that we can enter into.

03:42:06.237 --> 03:42:09.864
TRAVIS: Is it just the Tri-Spire, or is it
everywhere?

03:42:09.864 --> 03:42:17.529
MATT: Right now, it's just being put around the
Gilded Willows, which is a little ways further

03:42:17.529 --> 03:42:24.364
away from the estate as you're heading back. You
can see decorations going up, tables being set, it

03:42:24.364 --> 03:42:33.817
looks to be a small platform being risen. There's
some sort of event coming up fairly soon.

03:42:35.858 --> 03:42:38.973
TALIESIN: I'm perfectly content making snap
judgements of people, I've been doing it all my

03:42:38.973 --> 03:42:44.946
life and it's very rarely steered me wrong, and in
another time and another place, I'd be more than

03:42:44.946 --> 03:42:47.112
happy to run something.

03:42:47.112 --> 03:42:55.514
LIAM: Okay, so let me go over this, then. We have
no form of payment of any kind planned in advance.

03:42:55.514 --> 03:43:01.010
We don't know if this woman has done anything
besides being a snide puppy-hater.

03:43:01.010 --> 03:43:04.763
LAURA: She takes bribes. She's a corrupt
politician.

03:43:04.763 --> 03:43:11.314
LIAM: I have personally bribed people, I don't
know that I would-- listen, I do not like the

03:43:11.314 --> 03:43:18.784
government--I say this quietly--I do not like the
empire, but we're really sticking our neck out

03:43:18.784 --> 03:43:25.773
with very dangerous people. I don't think we have
much to go on, I don't think we know how we're

03:43:25.773 --> 03:43:29.356
going to be receiving recompense for this.

03:43:29.356 --> 03:43:32.704
TALIESIN: There is going to have to be some coin,
of course.

03:43:32.704 --> 03:43:36.395
TRAVIS: Certainly, your fears are founded. If
there's not enough pay, then obviously it's not

03:43:36.395 --> 03:43:41.280
worth the risk. But I have to say, that even after
meeting them for the second time, I feel like

03:43:41.280 --> 03:43:49.114
these people, they're good folks. I think they
just want to see their city bettered. Honestly,

03:43:49.114 --> 03:43:56.616
that Dolan fellow I think would do better in a
seat of power than this current wench.

03:43:59.199 --> 03:44:07.271
LIAM: Well, I am willing to discuss our continued
involvement, once the payment is figured out.

03:44:07.271 --> 03:44:09.620
TRAVIS: I think that's fair.

03:44:09.620 --> 03:44:16.631
MARISHA: I mean, look. People in power tend to get
corrupt, they don't start corrupt. In my opinion,

03:44:16.631 --> 03:44:21.742
it doesn't matter who's sitting there, as long as
we get paid from it, who cares?

03:44:22.213 --> 03:44:28.632
TRAVIS: And there's still many things to figure
out. We have to look after this Lord Sutan. But

03:44:28.632 --> 03:44:33.659
first, we should see to that afternoon meeting,
about the coin. We should address that straight out.

03:44:35.140 --> 03:44:37.835
LAURA: I guess we have to leave the Tri-Spire
then.

03:44:37.835 --> 03:44:43.792
TRAVIS: Yeah, I guess we do. We're meeting them at
the Song &amp; Supper Inn.

03:44:43.792 --> 03:44:45.213
LAURA: What time?

03:44:45.213 --> 03:44:46.454
TRAVIS: Just after noon.

03:44:46.454 --> 03:44:49.027
LAURA: Just after noon? You didn't get an hour?

03:44:49.242 --> 03:44:51.530
TRAVIS: I was not specific.

03:44:51.530 --> 03:44:53.142
SAM: We don't have watches.

03:44:53.142 --> 03:44:55.902
TALIESIN: 12:01. It's just after noon.

03:44:55.902 --> 03:44:58.759
TRAVIS: Yeah. Don't make me say it.

03:44:58.759 --> 03:45:02.173
LIAM: It's on all our minds. Unspoken.

03:45:02.173 --> 03:45:04.222
TRAVIS: I'm trying not to.

03:45:04.222 --> 03:45:06.376
TALIESIN: This place is giving me a rash.

03:45:06.376 --> 03:45:12.872
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess let's head there, meet up
with these guys. It's probably about that time, yeah?

03:45:13.088 --> 03:45:18.760
MATT: Yep. So you guys make your way, reversing
your steps, outside of the Tri-Spire, making your

03:45:18.760 --> 03:45:22.646
way towards the western side of the Interstead
Sprawl, to the Song &amp; Supper Inn.

03:45:22.646 --> 03:45:27.071
LAURA: Before we leave, are there any benches
around, just sitting?

03:45:27.071 --> 03:45:28.729
MATT: There are a few, yeah.

03:45:28.729 --> 03:45:36.384
LAURA: I want to leave one of the pamphlets for
the Traveler sitting on a bench.

03:45:36.384 --> 03:45:42.163
MATT: Okay, you sneakily slip it into a small gap,
so it's visible, but not liable to be blown away.

03:45:42.163 --> 03:45:43.973
Perfect.

03:45:45.353 --> 03:45:47.292
LAURA: Minus one.

03:45:47.485 --> 03:45:53.536
MATT: As you guys make your way to the interior of
the inn, it is lively. It is the loudest,

03:45:53.536 --> 03:45:59.656
musically, tavern, you've seen. You get the sense,
both by title, and by the interior, that this

03:45:59.656 --> 03:46:04.222
essentially a perpetual an open mic night for any
musicians or bards who want to come and try out

03:46:04.222 --> 03:46:11.697
their craft. There are three different bands that
are cycling through on the main, raised dais to

03:46:11.697 --> 03:46:18.696
perform. The atmosphere is lively, and folks come
here for that. It's a poor tavern, comparatively.

03:46:18.696 --> 03:46:26.843
The interior looks like a lot of the paint is
chipped and run or crinkled, the smell inside is

03:46:26.843 --> 03:46:33.430
not the best, but it serves basic food, basic
drinks, and at least an atmosphere of music and

03:46:33.430 --> 03:46:41.356
fun. Some folks sing along, and jump into a shanty
or two. As you come in, you can see both Ulog and

03:46:41.356 --> 03:46:45.712
Dolan are currently sitting at a table across from
each other. As they notice you guys approach, they

03:46:45.712 --> 03:46:50.821
raise a drink, and you can see the rest of the
table they have ready for you guys to come and sit.

03:46:50.829 --> 03:46:53.592
LIAM: We have already dropped our disguises if
they recognized us.

03:46:53.592 --> 03:46:55.609
TRAVIS: It took us 45 minutes to walk here.

03:46:55.609 --> 03:46:58.206
MATT: Your spells would have run out by now.

03:46:58.206 --> 03:47:04.563
MARISHA: Before we walk into the place, I turn my
coat inside out, back to the blue.

03:47:04.563 --> 03:47:08.292
LAURA: Any guards in the tavern?

03:47:08.292 --> 03:47:13.165
MATT: Not in the tavern, no. There was one
outside, but patrolling the streets. Not

03:47:13.165 --> 03:47:15.792
everything is super heavily guarded in smaller
areas like this.

03:47:15.792 --> 03:47:19.625
LAURA: Does it look like anybody is looking at us,
anybody else in the tavern?

03:47:19.625 --> 03:47:21.461
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:47:23.250 --> 03:47:24.621
SAM: Nice!

03:47:24.621 --> 03:47:27.231
LAURA: Ooh! 22.

03:47:27.231 --> 03:47:34.005
MATT: I mean, no more than anyone looks at you
when you enter a room, being a blue-skinned

03:47:34.005 --> 03:47:41.778
tiefling. You don't get the sense that anyone is
casing you the entire time that you've been there.

03:47:41.778 --> 03:47:44.465
MARISHA: It doesn't look like anyone followed us
in?

03:47:44.465 --> 03:47:46.622
MATT: You don't notice anybody following you in,
no.

03:47:46.622 --> 03:47:48.197
MARISHA: Okay.

03:47:48.197 --> 03:47:54.468
MATT: You see Dolan and Ulog are there waiting at
the table, as you come and join with them. Does

03:47:54.468 --> 03:47:56.248
everybody sit with them?

03:47:56.248 --> 03:48:00.593
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit at another table and
listen in.

03:48:00.593 --> 03:48:02.391
MARISHA: Fjord and I will go over.

03:48:02.391 --> 03:48:04.498
TRAVIS: The rest of you are welcome.

03:48:04.498 --> 03:48:06.413
SAM: You've met with them before, right?

03:48:06.413 --> 03:48:07.781
LIAM: Yeah.

03:48:07.781 --> 03:48:09.303
SAM: So you could go over.

03:48:09.303 --> 03:48:10.790
LIAM: I could, yeah.

03:48:12.060 --> 03:48:13.988
SAM: Let's go join them.

03:48:14.799 --> 03:48:16.912
TALIESIN: Really, oh fine.

03:48:16.912 --> 03:48:19.555
LIAM: Well, it has to happen eventually.

03:48:19.555 --> 03:48:23.460
TRAVIS: Molly, keep an eye on the room.

03:48:23.460 --> 03:48:33.326
MATT: You go with them to the table? Dolan gives you a
look. "And this is one of your associates?"

03:48:33.518 --> 03:48:35.575
MARISHA: Is that a problem?

03:48:35.575 --> 03:48:38.884
MATT: "No, I'd just like to ask your name."

03:48:38.884 --> 03:48:42.714
LAURA: Tonya Fancybottom. Nice to meet you.

03:48:42.714 --> 03:48:52.186
MATT: "Tonya? Pleasure. I'm Dolan, Dolan Thrym,
this is Ulog." He sits there, he's like, "Hey."

03:48:52.186 --> 03:48:56.533
They both take a very long minute and look over
you.

03:48:56.533 --> 03:48:58.902
MARISHA: Hey friend.

03:48:58.902 --> 03:49:02.778
MATT: "I'm sorry, I'm just being careful."

03:49:02.778 --> 03:49:06.382
LIAM: We're pretty ragtag, but they're both very
good at what they do.

03:49:06.382 --> 03:49:08.257
LAURA: I'm blue.

03:49:08.257 --> 03:49:10.134
MATT: "I can see that."

03:49:10.134 --> 03:49:13.301
MARISHA: People like her make you uncomfortable?

03:49:14.460 --> 03:49:15.772
MATT: "No."

03:49:15.772 --> 03:49:21.549
MARISHA: You sure? What about people like him?
People like him make you uncomfortable?

03:49:21.549 --> 03:49:25.760
MATT: "I mean only in the sense that they're fresh
faces."

03:49:25.760 --> 03:49:28.395
MARISHA: All right, just checking.

03:49:28.395 --> 03:49:30.370
TALIESIN: I'm giving a clear.

03:49:30.370 --> 03:49:36.155
MATT: Ulog leans in, he's like, "I've watched them
a bit, they're all friends, it's fine." Dolan

03:49:36.155 --> 03:49:38.587
goes, "All right."

03:49:38.587 --> 03:49:41.442
TRAVIS: (whispers) We've got to look for that
motherfucker more often.

03:49:41.442 --> 03:49:46.121
MARISHA: He's fucking everywhere. He's been
following us a lot. You said he was shifty, a

03:49:46.121 --> 03:49:47.625
little criminal--

03:49:47.625 --> 03:49:54.755
MATT: Dolan goes, "All right, so, we've been
looking for an opening, we've been trying to find

03:49:54.755 --> 03:50:00.567
out. We thought it was tonight, but they've pushed
it back a day. There is a pre-harvest gala

03:50:00.567 --> 03:50:06.688
happening in the Tri-Spire tomorrow night. We
figure this distraction would be enough to do any

03:50:06.688 --> 03:50:18.664
of the quiet infiltrations that we're attempting
to accomplish, should you still be interested in

03:50:18.664 --> 03:50:23.485
coming with us. I know there was hesitation, and I
don't want anyone to be coming into this that

03:50:23.485 --> 03:50:28.262
doesn't feel comfortable. To be honest, I want to
be comfortable as well, and to know that we're

03:50:28.262 --> 03:50:38.736
going to bed with the right people. Are there any
concerns? Any questions, worries?"

03:50:39.315 --> 03:50:44.610
TRAVIS: Sure. We did some casing of the
High-Richter ourselves. She's not the most savory

03:50:44.610 --> 03:50:51.401
type. I believe some of my associates have a
question of, well, the unsavory topic of payment.

03:50:51.401 --> 03:51:02.683
MATT: "Right. I assumed that was probably going to
be a thing. Me and Horris pitched in together. We

03:51:02.683 --> 03:51:11.474
don't have much, but this is too important to not.
Me and Horris put together about 115 gold between

03:51:11.474 --> 03:51:17.923
the two of us." He puts a small thing on the
table, showing it. He's not putting it out in the

03:51:17.923 --> 03:51:20.972
open because he doesn't want to be like "I have
all this money on the table!" He's like, "We have

03:51:20.972 --> 03:51:32.637
some. Kara put in 53 gold of her own." Ulog leans
in and goes, "513 gold, 21 silver, 302 copper.

03:51:32.637 --> 03:51:38.924
It's my life savings. I want to see these fuckers
burn."

03:51:39.957 --> 03:51:42.361
MARISHA: Wait. 500 from his personal stash?

03:51:42.361 --> 03:51:44.726
LIAM: Insight check on that statement.

03:51:44.726 --> 03:51:47.007
MATT: Make an insight check.

03:51:47.007 --> 03:51:49.254
LIAM: Balls. Total balls.

03:51:49.254 --> 03:51:51.705
MATT: Total balls? Hard to read.

03:51:53.115 --> 03:51:54.719
MARISHA: (whispers) Just under 700.

03:51:55.227 --> 03:52:02.734
TRAVIS: That's about the same as the King's Hall,
yeah.

03:52:07.274 --> 03:52:13.898
SAM: Caleb? This job doesn't involve monsters.
That's pretty good.

03:52:14.086 --> 03:52:25.573
LIAM: Literally, no. Figuratively? Yes. The
biggest and the baddest, potentially.

03:52:27.523 --> 03:52:31.290
LAURA: Would we be all going to this gala
together?

03:52:31.488 --> 03:52:35.114
MATT: "We wouldn't be going to the gala. We would
be--"

03:52:35.114 --> 03:52:36.508
MARISHA: Breaking in.

03:52:36.508 --> 03:52:38.078
TALIESIN: During the gala.

03:52:38.078 --> 03:52:39.515
LAURA: Oh, so no party.

03:52:39.515 --> 03:52:41.303
TALIESIN: Party after.

03:52:41.303 --> 03:52:44.067
MATT: "Party after."

03:52:44.067 --> 03:52:49.762
TRAVIS: Would anyone of your group like to be
joining us? Kara or Ulog, yourself?

03:52:49.762 --> 03:52:59.181
MATT: Ulog, still leaning forward, goes, "I'd like
to. I have the most at stake here, monetarily.

03:52:59.181 --> 03:53:04.517
I've got skills I think will synergize well with
the ones you bring to the table. I'll be coming

03:53:04.517 --> 03:53:06.191
with you."

03:53:06.191 --> 03:53:09.636
TRAVIS: I tend to believe him just because we
haven't seen him.

03:53:09.636 --> 03:53:11.684
LAURA: He's pretty stealthy.

03:53:11.684 --> 03:53:18.200
MATT: Dolan goes, "Kara, her skills are more in
the interpersonal level, not so much infiltration.

03:53:18.200 --> 03:53:23.698
And I'm just me, so I don't think I'd be of much
help."

03:53:23.698 --> 03:53:26.136
LAURA: Do you have healing potions?

03:53:26.136 --> 03:53:37.736
MATT: "Actually, yes. Not many. We have a few left
over. Horris should have a few more."

03:53:37.736 --> 03:53:41.613
LAURA: Just in case we get hurt or something.

03:53:41.613 --> 03:53:47.950
MATT: "I hope that isn't the case. Just in case,
all right. I'll have those sent. I'll send them

03:53:47.950 --> 03:53:49.602
along with Ulog for you."

03:53:49.602 --> 03:53:50.575
LAURA: Thank you.

03:53:50.575 --> 03:53:52.361
MATT: "Of course."

03:53:52.361 --> 03:53:56.994
TRAVIS: Did you happen to draft up any of those
Knights of Requital documents I asked for?

03:53:56.994 --> 03:53:58.414
Symbols?

03:53:58.414 --> 03:54:03.306
MATT: "Oh, yes." He pulls out a small piece of
parchment and discretely hands it to you under the

03:54:03.306 --> 03:54:13.478
table. You feel it tap your knee. As you look
inside, it's a symbol that looks like an R, but

03:54:13.478 --> 03:54:20.909
part of the R extends beyond to produce a K,
almost. It looks like a sigil or seal that

03:54:20.909 --> 03:54:22.846
utilizes the title in it.

03:54:22.846 --> 03:54:24.033
TRAVIS: That's actually nice work.

03:54:24.033 --> 03:54:25.405
MARISHA: That is really nice. That's good.

03:54:25.405 --> 03:54:26.845
TRAVIS: I hate to burn it, though.

03:54:26.845 --> 03:54:29.469
MARISHA: You could do this, some graphic design.

03:54:30.849 --> 03:54:33.051
TALIESIN: Did you procure this for us?

03:54:34.459 --> 03:54:36.864
LAURA: He created them for us.

03:54:36.864 --> 03:54:38.535
TALIESIN: That's impressive.

03:54:39.134 --> 03:54:40.903
MATT: "I haven't used my art degree."

03:54:40.903 --> 03:54:45.815
(laughter)

03:54:47.108 --> 03:54:48.263
TALIESIN: Wow!

03:54:48.263 --> 03:54:50.473
TRAVIS: Got Dolan drawing it.

03:54:50.473 --> 03:54:51.863
LIAM: Too real.

03:54:53.413 --> 03:54:58.134
MATT: "I have to ask you, because if we're all
going in on this, I have to be absolutely sure.

03:54:58.156 --> 03:55:04.220
Are you coming with us on this? You can back out.
There's no shame in that, but we're not going to

03:55:04.220 --> 03:55:07.703
go in this without your help as well. That would
be foolish."

03:55:08.832 --> 03:55:10.866
TRAVIS: A moment for us to confer, if you don't
mind.

03:55:10.866 --> 03:55:13.314
LIAM: We would like to discuss.

03:55:13.314 --> 03:55:21.081
MATT: He stands up for a second and says, "Ulog,
drink?" "Sure." They both get up from the table

03:55:21.081 --> 03:55:24.295
and walk over to the bar to get another round.

03:55:24.295 --> 03:55:25.801
LAURA: I watch Ulog.

03:55:25.801 --> 03:55:31.711
TALIESIN: I can probably get one of them the way I
did with Nott last night, if you like. Make sure

03:55:31.711 --> 03:55:34.442
we're not walking into anything we don't want to
be.

03:55:34.442 --> 03:55:36.809
TRAVIS: I don't get that impression, do you?

03:55:36.809 --> 03:55:39.012
TALIESIN: No, I do not, but--

03:55:39.012 --> 03:55:41.825
TRAVIS: Maybe not just yet.

03:55:41.825 --> 03:55:44.115
TALIESIN: That's fine.

03:55:44.115 --> 03:55:46.305
TRAVIS: I like the offer, though.

03:55:46.305 --> 03:55:51.785
MARISHA: If anything, I feel bad. Feels like
they're investing a lot of money on this play.

03:55:51.785 --> 03:55:55.758
TRAVIS: They'll get their return back if he's
High-Richter afterwards, though.

03:55:55.758 --> 03:55:58.008
MARISHA: <i>If</i> he's High-Richter.

03:55:58.225 --> 03:56:01.876
TALIESIN: And if he's not, then they don't have to
pay, because we obviously failed.

03:56:01.876 --> 03:56:04.868
TRAVIS: We're just being paid to empty the seat,
not to put him in it.

03:56:04.868 --> 03:56:10.327
MARISHA: Correct. It would be super unfortunate to
see someone else slide in there, other than him.

03:56:10.327 --> 03:56:13.053
But like you said, not our problem.

03:56:13.053 --> 03:56:16.009
TRAVIS: Nott, Caleb? I know you had reservations.

03:56:16.009 --> 03:56:18.424
TALIESIN: It's a good pay day.

03:56:18.424 --> 03:56:28.244
LIAM: I want to walk away very fast if this goes
wrong. My hackles are up. It does not feel as sure

03:56:28.244 --> 03:56:32.691
a bet as other things that we have done together.
But okay.

03:56:32.691 --> 03:56:35.311
SAM: If Caleb's in, I'm in.

03:56:35.311 --> 03:56:40.971
TRAVIS: We'll see what kind of plan we can come up
with. We have a day.

03:56:40.971 --> 03:56:42.773
SAM: Yasha?

03:56:43.608 --> 03:56:45.673
TRAVIS: You hear thunder.

03:56:48.551 --> 03:56:53.940
TALIESIN: I respect this squarely, but if you
really feel like this is turning, then we'll turn.

03:56:54.131 --> 03:56:58.428
LIAM: But there's money involved, so there's
incentive.

03:56:58.464 --> 03:57:03.801
MARISHA: We have a little bit of time. We can
still do a little bit of casing, maybe go talk to

03:57:03.801 --> 03:57:07.280
the Gentleman and see what he has to offer in
between.

03:57:07.280 --> 03:57:08.964
TRAVIS: We have a day, right?

03:57:08.964 --> 03:57:11.247
MARISHA: Right? A day and a night?

03:57:11.247 --> 03:57:15.551
MATT: Yeah. You have the rest of the day, the
evening, and tomorrow night is apparently the

03:57:15.551 --> 03:57:18.381
Pre-Harvest Gala in the Tri-Spire.

03:57:18.381 --> 03:57:21.841
TRAVIS: When we will strike! Jester, how do you
feel?

03:57:21.841 --> 03:57:24.703
LAURA: I think it sounds fun! Sure, why not.

03:57:24.703 --> 03:57:28.380
TRAVIS: Oh! okay.

03:57:28.380 --> 03:57:33.517
SAM: Should we order up some puppies to celebrate?
Just kidding.

03:57:36.675 --> 03:57:42.621
LAURA: I've never eaten a dog. I feel like I would
feel really weird about it.

03:57:42.621 --> 03:57:44.888
SAM: Me neither.

03:57:46.208 --> 03:57:48.467
TRAVIS: We can call them back over.

03:57:49.793 --> 03:57:54.370
MATT: You see Dolan and Ulog are having their
drink at the bar. They walk up and sit down. "So

03:57:54.370 --> 03:57:56.593
can we count on you?"

03:57:56.593 --> 03:57:58.634
LIAM: One hundred percent.

03:57:58.634 --> 03:58:00.471
TALIESIN: We're in.

03:58:00.471 --> 03:58:03.181
LAURA: The Fancybottom name is one you can trust!

03:58:05.102 --> 03:58:14.198
MATT: You see Ulog and Dolan share a look and nod.
A smile comes across Dolan's face. "Thank you. You

03:58:14.198 --> 03:58:23.125
won't regret it! I suppose, prepare whatever
you'll need. We'll meet back in the cellar of The

03:58:23.125 --> 03:58:30.103
Leaky Tap tomorrow at sundown, and we'll take it
from there." You can sense this excited

03:58:30.103 --> 03:58:33.826
nervousness to his voice that wasn't there before
as he smiles.

03:58:33.863 --> 03:58:36.851
LAURA: Do you have a good way to get into the
Tri-Spire?

03:58:36.851 --> 03:58:38.567
MATT: "We have a few ideas."

03:58:38.567 --> 03:58:40.292
LAURA: Okay.

03:58:40.292 --> 03:58:43.369
MATT: "Til tomorrow, then!"

03:58:43.369 --> 03:58:46.408
TRAVIS: Til tomorrow.

03:58:46.408 --> 03:58:52.383
MATT: He gets up and finishes his drink and
buttons the top button of his shirt, and then

03:58:52.383 --> 03:59:00.617
makes his way out. Ulog sits up, goes and takes
what swills at the bottom of Dolan's drink and

03:59:00.617 --> 03:59:08.182
finishes it, then finishes his drink, pops it
down. "Til tomorrow." He gets up and leaves.

03:59:09.354 --> 03:59:11.310
TALIESIN: Has anyone been watching us?

03:59:11.310 --> 03:59:12.614
MATT: Perception check.

03:59:12.614 --> 03:59:14.437
LIAM: He is hard to read.

03:59:14.437 --> 03:59:17.088
TALIESIN: That's an eight.

03:59:17.088 --> 03:59:19.323
LIAM: Level three, motherfucker.

03:59:19.323 --> 03:59:21.629
MATT: You don't notice anybody paying attention.

03:59:21.629 --> 03:59:24.649
LAURA: I feel like I would've been looking, too,
because I was watching for people at the beginning

03:59:24.649 --> 03:59:25.925
of that.

03:59:25.925 --> 03:59:32.426
MATT: The only thing you notice is that on the way
out, Dolan -- As he heads to the door, you see

03:59:32.426 --> 03:59:38.587
Kara, the half-elf, was waiting at the door. As
soon as he heads over, she goes, "So?" They both

03:59:38.587 --> 03:59:41.925
exit into the main thoroughfare.

03:59:41.925 --> 03:59:47.576
TRAVIS: I actually like what Molly said. I feel
like tomorrow night, before we go, you should do

03:59:47.576 --> 03:59:51.130
your thing on Ulog.

03:59:51.130 --> 03:59:55.369
LAURA: I also have a spell that can make people
tell the truth.

03:59:55.369 --> 04:00:00.666
TRAVIS: That would work great. I think they'd
understand, too. If we did it too early, I think

04:00:00.666 --> 04:00:05.919
they-- cause you to cause suspicion. After all,
we're only trying to make sure that this isn't a

04:00:05.919 --> 04:00:08.836
trap set for us.

04:00:09.084 --> 04:00:11.115
LIAM: Which is possible.

04:00:11.115 --> 04:00:13.730
TRAVIS: Make you feel better, if we had the
answer.

04:00:13.730 --> 04:00:15.645
LIAM: Yeah. Most likely.

04:00:17.145 --> 04:00:19.965
TRAVIS: What do we do this evening to prepare?

04:00:21.587 --> 04:00:23.270
SAM: Get drunk?

04:00:23.270 --> 04:00:26.897
TRAVIS: Well, I was thinking more along the lines
of checking out Lord Sutan.

04:00:26.897 --> 04:00:29.663
SAM: Okay.

04:00:29.663 --> 04:00:33.881
MARISHA: We got to go back to the Tri-Spire? Which
we can do.

04:00:33.881 --> 04:00:38.396
LAURA: Or, no, we can just go to the hall of the
Hall of Justice.

04:00:38.396 --> 04:00:41.702
(laughter)

04:00:41.702 --> 04:00:44.115
LIAM: Meanwhile, at the Soltryce Academy.

04:00:44.115 --> 04:00:45.863
SAM and LAURA: The King's Hall?

04:00:45.863 --> 04:00:48.611
MARISHA: Is that where Lord Sutan is?

04:00:48.611 --> 04:00:55.145
MATT: You don't know much about Lord Sutan. You
haven't heard his name referenced at all with any

04:00:55.145 --> 04:00:56.294
of the--

04:00:56.294 --> 04:01:04.289
TRAVIS: They just left and we forgot to ask where
the <i>fuck</i> he is! Twice! Can we run out after them?

04:01:04.481 --> 04:01:06.525
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Wait wait wait!

04:01:06.525 --> 04:01:08.410
MATT: Make a perception check.

04:01:08.410 --> 04:01:11.721
TRAVIS: Oh god. Oh! 15.

04:01:11.721 --> 04:01:18.549
MATT: 15? You glance through the crowd, and you
can just make out, it the distance, the back of

04:01:18.549 --> 04:01:21.891
Ulog as he's walking down the street, about to
turn.

04:01:21.891 --> 04:01:25.147
TRAVIS: One sec. (panting)

04:01:26.931 --> 04:01:30.728
MATT: As you catch up, he glances over his
shoulder at the sound of the running, and he goes,

04:01:30.728 --> 04:01:31.725
"What?"

04:01:31.725 --> 04:01:35.679
TRAVIS: You dropped this money. (whispering) Where
do we find Lord Sutan?

04:01:35.679 --> 04:01:42.651
MATT: "I don't fucking know. His estate? He's not
that far from where the gala's happening."

04:01:42.651 --> 04:01:45.879
TRAVIS: Just take it and say thank you!
(whispering) Okay, don't worry about it.

04:01:45.879 --> 04:01:50.349
(panting)

04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:52.456
They don't know.

04:01:54.200 --> 04:01:55.683
LAURA: But the Tri-Spire.

04:01:55.683 --> 04:01:56.952
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:01:56.952 --> 04:01:59.271
MATT: He knows where he lives, that's it.

04:01:59.271 --> 04:02:01.094
TRAVIS: They know where he lives.

04:02:01.094 --> 04:02:02.812
MARISHA: In the Tri-Spire?

04:02:02.812 --> 04:02:04.511
TRAVIS: In the Tri-Spire.

04:02:04.511 --> 04:02:08.487
LIAM: So it's another dance through the sewer if
we want to do that tonight, which we could do.

04:02:08.487 --> 04:02:12.064
TRAVIS: Yeah. Maybe that guard got his job back.

04:02:12.064 --> 04:02:14.637
MARISHA: He respawned.

04:02:14.637 --> 04:02:17.947
LIAM: Yeah, I think that ship has sailed, Fjord.

04:02:17.947 --> 04:02:20.236
TRAVIS: I'm sure he's fine.

04:02:20.236 --> 04:02:23.900
MARISHA: Okay, well at dawn, we plan?

04:02:23.900 --> 04:02:26.431
LAURA: Yeah.

04:02:26.431 --> 04:02:33.442
TRAVIS: Well, we got to figure out where the Lord
Sutan's estate is, get a wax seal, a writing,

04:02:33.442 --> 04:02:35.755
forge his hand.

04:02:35.755 --> 04:02:37.618
LAURA: We're going to do all that during the
gala?

04:02:37.618 --> 04:02:38.853
SAM: Yeah.

04:02:38.853 --> 04:02:41.107
MATT: That's all, supposedly, in one night.

04:02:41.107 --> 04:02:44.551
TRAVIS: Fair enough.
Yeah, at dawn, we plan.

04:02:44.762 --> 04:02:46.918
MARISHA: At dawn, we plan.

04:02:46.918 --> 04:02:52.103
MATT: At dawn, we plan. And that's where we'll
pick up next week. Building up to--

04:02:52.103 --> 04:02:54.160
SAM: There's so much build up.

04:02:54.160 --> 04:03:07.235
MATT: I know. D&amp;D, motherfucker. So we'll see
where this takes you guys next week, during the

04:03:07.235 --> 04:03:09.049
Pre-Harvest Gala.

04:03:09.049 --> 04:03:11.564
MARISHA: I think we're going to have to reignite
our planning thread.

04:03:11.564 --> 04:03:12.592
TRAVIS: Yep!

04:03:12.592 --> 04:03:14.126
MARISHA: It's time!

04:03:14.126 --> 04:03:15.620
LIAM: Come up with one.

04:03:15.620 --> 04:03:17.498
MARISHA: Yeah. Dust the cobwebs off of it.

04:03:17.498 --> 04:03:19.281
LIAM: Actually come up with one.

04:03:19.281 --> 04:03:25.788
MARISHA: It's good. We're going to go full Ocean's
Nein, you guys!

04:03:25.788 --> 04:03:30.572
TRAVIS: We got Pumat Sol back, man! We need Pumat
every once and awhile.

04:03:30.572 --> 04:03:34.569
MATT: You brought back Pumat, you bought D&amp;D
smut.

04:03:34.569 --> 04:03:36.415
TRAVIS: That's right!

04:03:36.415 --> 04:03:38.723
MARISHA: And bear claws.

04:03:38.723 --> 04:03:41.037
MATT: There you go! Bought some bear claws.

04:03:41.037 --> 04:03:42.726
TALIESIN: I got a nifty necklace.

04:03:42.726 --> 04:03:43.726
MATT: You did.

04:03:43.726 --> 04:03:46.990
TALIESIN: It does cool things on D&amp;D-- when I put
it on my character, it did really cool things. It

04:03:46.990 --> 04:03:48.645
got a little picture.

04:03:48.645 --> 04:03:49.732
MATT: Oh, that's cool!

04:03:49.732 --> 04:03:51.800
TALIESIN: On D&amp;D Beyond. That's nice.

04:03:51.800 --> 04:04:01.212
MATT: Awesome. Well, we'll pick up for the ensuing
tension next week on Thursday. This weekend, we'll

04:04:01.212 --> 04:04:04.905
see you guys who are planning to come down to
WonderCon for our panel, 11:30 in the morning, on

04:04:04.905 --> 04:04:09.419
Sunday. Hopefully we'll see you guys there. Until
then, have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday

04:04:09.419 --> 04:04:12.584
yet? Good night.

04:04:13.174 --> 04:16:45.486

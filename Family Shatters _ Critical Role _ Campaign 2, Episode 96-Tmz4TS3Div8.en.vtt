00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.403
MATT: Hello everyone, and
welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

2
00:00:02.403 --> 00:00:03.878
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

3
00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:05.044
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:07.594
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:08.985
TALIESIN: Dragons!

6
00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:10.820
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: There you go.

7
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.020
Welcome. Before we jump into tonight's session,

8
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.980
we have a few announcements to get through,

9
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.380
including the first of our two fantastic sponsors tonight,

10
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.213
Two Point Hospital.

11
00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:21.860
Sam, if you don't mind with whatever this is.

12
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.177
SAM: This week's episode is sponsored by

13
00:00:23.177 --> 00:00:25.500
the hit PC hospital management game,

14
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.990
Two Point Hospital, coming to PS4, Xbox One

15
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.370
and Nintendo Switch on February 25th.

16
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.430
So now you can finally build, manage, and maintain

17
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.640
your very own healthcare empire

18
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.750
from the comfort of your couch, which got me thinking,

19
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.910
what kind of doctor would I want to be?

20
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.743
MATT: Oh no.

21
00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:45.220
(dramatic music)

22
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.310
MARISHA: Doctor, I need a doctor.

23
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.140
SAM: Why hello, it's me, Dr. Raul Amor, PhD,

24
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.031
but you can call me

25
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:55.231
Dr. Love.

26
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.790
(laughter)

27
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.550
I studied at all the most prestigious

28
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.350
international medical institutions,

29
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.860
I'm an expert in emergency brain surgery,

30
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.450
facial replacement surgery, and operating

31
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.817
in war zones with no electricity.

32
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.300
MARISHA: Thank god, I feel really awful.

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.090
SAM: Let me take a look.

34
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.490
Your heart.

35
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.660
MARISHA: Is something wrong?

36
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.930
SAM: No, I've just never heard
a more passionate soul before.

37
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.270
I'm ready to make my diagnosis.

38
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.347
You need 30 cc's of tender loving care,

39
00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:28.180
(groaning)

40
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.200
20 seconds of smoldering looks,

41
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.783
and kiss on the cheek from yours truly.

42
00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:34.360
MARISHA: (grunting)

43
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.730
SAM: Oh no!

44
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.310
Looks like the patient wasn't ready

45
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.360
for my medical grade handsomeness.

46
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.640
LIAM: No, you idiot, her appendix is ruptured.

47
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.809
She needs antibiotics and surgery.

48
00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:46.440
(laughter)

49
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.930
SAM: What's your name?

50
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.900
They call me Dr. Love.

51
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.543
LIAM: What is wrong with you, Sam?

52
00:01:53.543 --> 00:01:55.780
(laughter)

53
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.615
SAM: And scene.

54
00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.420
(laughter)

55
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.720
MATT: What?

56
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.761
SAM: That's the whole bit.

57
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:03.405
(laughter)

58
00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:05.950
MATT: Okay!
SAM: When you-- (coughs)

59
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.370
I'm sick, guys.

60
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.250
(laughter)

61
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.230
LIAM: In the head.

62
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.570
SAM: When you buy Two Point Hospital on console,

63
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.090
you also get two DLC expansions.

64
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.273
You'll be doing that all night.

65
00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:21.220
LAURA: No!

66
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.600
SAM: Including Pebberly Island, where you can blaze

67
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.070
a sterilized trail through a tropical island paradise,

68
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.278
and the Bigfoot DLC,

69
00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:32.520
where you help local celebrity Yeti,

70
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.570
Bartholomew F. Yeti--

71
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.510
TRAVIS: Yep.
SAM: -- on his quest

72
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600
to improve the well-being of sickly locals.

73
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.840
TRAVIS: Sounds right.
SAM: We'll be playing it

74
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.780
when it launches next Tuesday

75
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.964
in a special episode of Everything is Content.

76
00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:44.338
LAURA: Yay!
TRAVIS: Oh sweet, we are?

77
00:02:44.338 --> 00:02:45.370
Awesome!

78
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.420

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.228

(applause)

83
00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.566
TRAVIS: Nice job, doc.
TALIESIN: You can stay here

84
00:02:56.566 --> 00:02:57.466
the whole time.
MATT: Here you go.

85
00:02:57.466 --> 00:02:58.910
See, even in digital worlds,

86
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.927
you can build a better healthcare system than America has.

87
00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:04.650
(chuckles)

88
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.950
Thank you, Sam, thank you, Two Point Hospital.

A couple of announcements I got to get to.

102
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.867
Issue number five of Vox Machina: Origins is now available--

103
00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:39.600
LIAM: Look at that beautiful bastard!

104
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.450
MATT: -- at your local favorite comic book store,

as well as digitally at ComiXology, Dark Horse Digital

106
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.930
and other fine places comic books are available.

107
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.950
Percy finally joins Vox Machina.

108
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.810
TALIESIN: It's so good.

109
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.240
It's so good.
MATT: Jody Houser--

110
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.980
SAM: You know how there's some
comic book series where, like,

111
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.350
number one isn't the one, the collectible.

112
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.580
It's the first appearance of blah blah blah.

113
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.150
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: This could be that one.

114
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.520
MATT: It probably will be.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

115
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.825
MATT: Thank you, Sam.
SAM: Sure.

116
00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:08.258
LAURA: Maybe.

117
00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:09.750
SAM: It could be this one!

118
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.470
TALIESIN: It could.
MATT: Indeed.

119
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.503
SAM: Spider-Man also makes an appearance in this one.

120
00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:14.586
LAURA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Oh, good, good, good.

121
00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.039
MATT: Can't confirm that.

122
00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.030
Can't confirm that.
SAM: It's Spider-Man's

123
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.290
first appearance--
MATT: No.

124
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.123
SAM: -- in Critical Role--

125
00:04:19.123 --> 00:04:20.060
MATT: No.
SAM: -- in this series.

126
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.230
MATT: No, that's not true at all.

127
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.063
TRAVIS: Man-Spider.

128
00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:22.896
MATT: But you know what it is?

129
00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.470
It's amazing cover art by our fan artist,

130
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.430
CoupleofKooks, @kooks000.. They're an amazing artist.

131
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.850
They did a great job with that cover art.

132
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.158
TRAVIS: So good.

133
00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:34.390
MATT: I mean, once again, Jody
Houser, such incredible writer.

134
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.560
Olivia Samson's in here, everybody
who is involved in this project

135
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.590
did a great job--
LIAM: Hold it up again,

136
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.880
hold it up again. (groans)

137
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.442
Gatorade is thirsty.

138
00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:41.566
TRAVIS: My clothes just fell off.

139
00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:42.540
MATT: It's so good.
(laughter)

140
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.710
TALIESIN: That was a good game, by the way.

141
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.920
I remember that game, that was a good game.

142
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.251
That was a really good session.

143
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:50.800
MATT: Also, we are heading to Chicago next week for C2E2.

144
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.410
TRAVIS: Chicago!
MATT: Super excited.

145
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.310
We have a very special live show coming up

146
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.680
on that Thursday that we'll be streaming live

147
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.050
an hour earlier.

148
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.400
Those who aren't familiar with

149
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.400
the weird time scheduling changes between time zones,

150
00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:08.440
but we will be, this'll be 6:00pm Pacific next Thursday

151
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.190
on Twitch, 8:00pm Central,

152
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.960
and if you're attending C2E2,

153
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.520
be sure to check out our panel on Saturday

154
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.290
at 11:00am on the main stage.

155
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.840
So excited for that, looking forward to meeting

156
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.370
all the Critters out there in Chicago, and it'll be awesome.

157
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.520
Laura, you have some announcements.

158
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.530
LAURA: Oh, wow, yes I do.

159
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.800
(stilted) This week, we have put up for sale

160
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.558
all of our merchandise from our 2019 live shows--

161
00:05:33.558 --> 00:05:34.866
that--

162
00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:36.202
SAM: Why are you talking like that?

163
00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:39.260
LAURA: You can't-- that were unavailable before,

164
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.460
except at the live shows,

165
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.770
but I should let you, okay,

166
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.110
so I'm going to tell you what they are.

167
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.570
We have an oversized d20.

168
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.560
Ooh!

169
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.220
We've got these beautiful metal dice.

170
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.380
Ooh, they're so heavy!

171
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.330
And then the Jester chibi pin

172
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.660
that was only available at the live show,

173
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.340
so it actually says series number one, which is pretty cool,

174
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.900
and it's got, you know, the little special glitter

175
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.520
on it, because it's Jester.

176
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.020
SAM: Are these limited items?

177
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.170
LAURA: They are limited items, and they are probably

178
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.020
going to sell out very soon, because we only had a few left

179
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.105
that we put in the store, so just so you guys know,

180
00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:11.705
once they're gone, they're gone.

181
00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:14.876
Okay that's it, that's it, that's all I got.

182
00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:16.070
(laughter)
ASHLEY: The box looks cool.

183
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.769
LAURA: I know, it's so pretty right?

184
00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:18.978
ASHLEY: Om nom nom nom.

185
00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:21.294
(laughter)

186
00:06:21.294 --> 00:06:24.243
I forgot we are on camera.

187
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.601
MATT: I love you so much, Ashley.

188
00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:30.100
LAURA: So I shall say that the chibi pin,

189
00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:34.170
the art was by Jenny Park.

190
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.330
MATT: Jenny Park, woo!

191
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.294
TRAVIS: As we know, it showed up on Game Ranch later.

192
00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:39.695
Om nom nom! I'm a box!

193
00:06:39.695 --> 00:06:42.530
(laughter)

194
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.363
LAURA: Lean away.

195
00:06:43.363 --> 00:06:45.650
(laughter)

196
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.480
ASHLEY: Stop looking at me!

197
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.010
MATT: All righty, I believe then, without further ado,

198
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.360
let us go ahead and jump into tonight's episode

199
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.545

MATT: And welcome back.

236
00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:43.457
So last we left off--
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

237
00:08:43.457 --> 00:08:44.440
Damn it.

238
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.840
MATT: The Mighty Nein had made their
way to the southern edge

239
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.230
of Xhorhas to the Whitedawn Lagoon

240
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.300
in search of what had seemed to be the next destination in

241
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.420
Caduceus' main journey

242
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.570
through his visions he had received

243
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.810
from the Wild Mother, in hopes of hopefully coming upon

244
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.290
the rest of his family, as they themselves

245
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.180
have been traveling, scattered a bit over time.

246
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.700
You made your way through the jungles,

247
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.080
on the southwestern edge of the Whitedawn Lagoon coast.

248
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.850
Through there, you encountered some dangerous creatures,

249
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.500
had some revelations with the Traveler,

250
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.740
and a unique series of conversations

251
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.669
of mild understanding that where both sides (chuckles)

252
00:09:23.669 --> 00:09:24.502
between you and him stand

253
00:09:24.502 --> 00:09:28.490
and the impending gathering of traveler followers

254
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.540
in the weeks to come.

255
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.900
Upon battling your way through the jungle

256
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.180
and some odd creatures that didn't seem indigenous

257
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.890
to this specific region, you made your way to the Oasis

258
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:42.160
in question, a beautiful lake lying here in the center

259
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.180
of this deep, dense jungle,

260
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.370
its deep red earth exposed against the clear waters

261
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.960
and a collection of stone sculptures

262
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.020
that peppered the entirety of the banks here,

263
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.000
all sorts of creatures and people,

264
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.000
which upon closer look, seem to be a bit

265
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.090
more detailed than you anticipated.

266
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.300
Upon inspecting a number of these entities--

267
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.297
SAM: Oh, Jesus, a lot of them.

268
00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:11.339
TALIESIN: That's not good for my anxiety, thank you.

269
00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:13.240
MATT: A number of these entities,

270
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.310
Caduceus recognized members of his family

271
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.480
amongst these statues, and as you begin to assess

272
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.430
the scenery, you heard the heavy hoofbeats

273
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.580
of a creature charging from the treeline in your direction.

274
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.940
A metally-armored bull-like entity, swollen with muscle,

275
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.990
and it seemed to be these piercing barbs

276
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.330
that push between its metal plates,

277
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.530
emitting some sort of a greenish feeling

278
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.750
from between its various exposed underbellies,

279
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.810
its giant carved horns pushing forward and hooked

280
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:46.740
as it barreled towards you.

281
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.170
You hear this large bellowing roar

282
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.540
as its mouth opens up, not like that of a bull's,

283
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.110
but like a giant two-part scoop jaw,

284
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.210
It is unnatural, it is mutated,

285
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.550
and it is charging your direction.

286
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.680
I need, first off, you all to place yourselves

287
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.650
on this battlefield.

288
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.190
Caduceus, you had just inspected your two members

289
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.740
of your family right there.

290
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.900
TALIESIN: Cool.
TRAVIS: I'm near the water line.

291
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.900
LAURA: I like that we don't need to know

292
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.988
where this creature is--

293
00:11:10.988 --> 00:11:11.821
TRAVIS: I know!

294
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:13.080
(laughter)

295
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.913
MATT: Of course!

296
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.813
TRAVIS: I'll go...

297
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.470
Yeah.
MATT: There you go.

298
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.180
All right, Beauregard.

299
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.870
MARISHA: I don't know.

300
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.690
I'll be--
TRAVIS: Not there!

301
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.810
MARISHA: No, from, up a little bit from Caduceus.

302
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.880
MATT: Here?
MARISHA: Yeah, that sounds good,

303
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.790
that sounds good.

304
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.910
MATT: Okay.

305
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.220
LIAM: I remember that I said I was curious

306
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.280
about different kinds of animals.

307
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.590
Let's put me by the moorbounder-looking statue.

308
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.504
MATT: The young moorbounder there?

309
00:11:37.504 --> 00:11:39.100
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

310
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.933
Yasha?

311
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.780
ASHLEY: Okay, I feel like, I'm going to go--

312
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.637
LIAM: It's all exclamation points.

313
00:11:45.637 --> 00:11:48.250
ASHLEY: -- that way, near the shoreline,

314
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.400
because I was peeking into it.

315
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.770
The other side, yeah, yeah.

316
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:51.940
MATT: Here?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

317
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.490
Just because, why not be alone out there.

318
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.323
MATT: Jester?

319
00:11:56.323 --> 00:11:57.490
MARISHA: Sorry, Chris, sorry, Chris.

320
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.296
LAURA: I'm going to say that I was near Fjord.

321
00:12:01.296 --> 00:12:03.440
MATT: So that'd be over in this region. Whereabouts?

322
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.940
LAURA: Let's be-- I'm going to be checking out

323
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.130
this little dude over here.

324
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.230
MATT: Okay, you got it.

325
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.272
ASHLEY: He's going to come in behind me and kill me.

326
00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:11.160
MATT: Nott?
SAM: Nott would like

327
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.400
to be in Boston at PAX East

328
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.870
where you can check out the Dwarven Forge booth

329
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.940
at Elderwood Academy booth

330
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.570
where you can go check out Dwarven Forge

331
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.670
and get a peek at their Kickstarter, Wildlands.

332
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.740
TALIESIN: Really?
SAM: Find out more

333
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.740
at DwarvenForge.com, but Nott can't be there, so instead,

334
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.490
Nott would like to go closer to that tree.

335
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.323
LIAM: I like that you--
LAURA: What tree?

336
00:12:35.323 --> 00:12:36.440
LIAM: -- threw that over your shoulder

337
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.504
and it landed directly in front of us.

338
00:12:37.504 --> 00:12:39.604
SAM: Yeah, because it was like, you're not done with this.

339
00:12:39.604 --> 00:12:41.020
MATT: Nott. Like here?

340
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.660
Like up on the top of here, behind it?

341
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.400
SAM: Yeah, which direction were we moving in?

342
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.660
MATT: You guys are moving up along--

343
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.493
LAURA: And we were walking--

344
00:12:46.493 --> 00:12:48.760
SAM: I want to be not close to the water.

345
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.593
TRAVIS: That's true.

346
00:12:49.593 --> 00:12:50.740
SAM: So just like, yeah,

347
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.180
where that hump is next to that tree.

348
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.050
MATT: Right here?
SAM: That'd be great, yeah.

349
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.260
MATT: Okay, there you are.

350
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.443
TRAVIS and LAURA: ♪ My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump ♪

351
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.233
LAURA: ♪ Check it out! ♪

352
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.000
MATT: And thereabouts just where it's coming from.

353
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.640
ASHLEY: What?

354
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.620
LAURA: Moo!

355
00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:08.354
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: That's the sound

356
00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.280
I imagine it makes.
TRAVIS: No!

357
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.111
MATT: So need everyone to roll initiative, please.

358
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:14.760
(groaning)

359
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.750
LIAM: Goodness.

360
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.330
MARISHA: Wait, did he plant it?

361
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.300
Do we see it?

362
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.759
MATT: Right there.
MARISHA: Oh sh--

363
00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:24.520
LIAM: Wow, a rare high number for Caleb's initiative.

364
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.590
MARISHA: Oh, a rare low number for Beau.

365
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.423
MATT: Okay.

366
00:13:30.423 --> 00:13:32.780
MARISHA: Fun.
MATT: So 25 to 20?

367
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.270
LIAM: 20.
MATT: All right.

368
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.540
LIAM: Jeez.
MATT: Caleb up front.

369
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.615
LAURA: What?
LIAM: I don't like that at all.

370
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.030
MATT: 20 to 15?

371
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.870
LAURA: 17.

372
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.880
TALIESIN: 16.
TRAVIS: 18.

373
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.660
SAM: Wow, guys, those are great rolls!

374
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.030
LAURA: What did you say, Yasha?

375
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.190
MATT: What'd you get, Caduceus?

376
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.800
TALIESIN: 16.
ASHLEY: I'm not up yet.

377
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.330
MATT: Jester, you said you were 17?

378
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.163
LAURA: Yes, sir.

379
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:54.090
MATT: All right. Caduceus.
TALIESIN: With advantage?

380
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.080
MATT: 15 to 10.

381
00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.980
SAM: Oh, that's me.

382
00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.046
No, it's not.

383
00:13:59.046 --> 00:13:59.879
ASHLEY: 11.

384
00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:00.712
MATT: What is it?
ASHLEY: 11.

385
00:14:00.712 --> 00:14:03.612
MATT: 11, all right.
ASHLEY: (British accent) This one goes to 11.

386
00:14:03.612 --> 00:14:04.545
TALIESIN: (British accent) Nice.

387
00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:06.004
ASHLEY: Sorry.

388
00:14:06.004 --> 00:14:06.854
LAURA: (frustrated yell)

389
00:14:06.854 --> 00:14:07.687
ASHLEY: I'm not alone.

390
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.081
MATT: Ten to five.

391
00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:10.960
SAM: Seven.

392
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.073
MARISHA: Eight. I'm ashamed of myself.

393
00:14:15.073 --> 00:14:17.777
Wow, Nott. You were low, too.

394
00:14:17.777 --> 00:14:19.130
SAM: Yeah.

395
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.440
MATT: All right, that is all.

396
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.723
After you hear the low haunting, like, (bellows).

397
00:14:25.723 --> 00:14:29.210
This this weird almost dire horn

398
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.122
of a bellowing yell from this creature. (thudding footsteps)

399
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:35.480
You see sand and red dirt being thrown up, the ground

400
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.520
cracking beneath it as it just barrels forward.

401
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.680
These two hooked, spiked horns at the front of it.

402
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.840
Its glowing green eyes and the fume

403
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.220
that's spilling out from between its armored pieces.

404
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.110
Up top we have Caleb. What are you doing, buddy?

405
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.920
LIAM: So in that split second moment, Caleb sees Caduceus'

406
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.640
look of recognition and realizes

407
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.770
what is happening over here and sees this thing

408
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.728
coming through the underbrush.

409
00:14:56.728 --> 00:14:59.911
So rattling through his bag, molasses along his hand

410
00:14:59.911 --> 00:15:03.260
which he then spins in the air and I will cast Slow.

411
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.370
MATT: Slow on that?
LIAM: Yeah.

412
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.010
MATT: All righty. What is the save on that one?

413
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.300
LIAM: That is a 17.
MATT: Seven-- no, what kind of--

414
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.108
LIAM: Oh, wisdom.
MATT: Wisdom.

415
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.180
It's a failure, it's going to use a legendary resistance.

416
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.583
ALL: Oh!

417
00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:18.670
TRAVIS: A legendary resistance.
MATT: Yes, it does.

418
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.440
SAM: It's probably just got one of those.

419
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.600
MATT: You attempt to reach out and weave

420
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.860
this arcane net into its physicality to slow it down.

421
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.720
It shrugs it off, no effect,

422
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.080
and continues barreling forward.

423
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.350
You still have movement and a bonus action.

424
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.320
LIAM: Yeah. He'll then just take

425
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.700
a little shimmy to the side to stand behind

426
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.310
this stone animal and yeah, that's right.

427
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.340
And then maybe five feet diagonally that way

428
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.470
as well, backing away.

429
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.520
MATT: There?
LIAM: No.

430
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.110
MATT: There?
LIAM: There, yeah.

431
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.943
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Okay.

432
00:15:47.943 --> 00:15:49.000
MATT: You got it.

433
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.160
All righty, Fjord, you're up.

434
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.289
TRAVIS: Oh, god, it is my turn!

435
00:15:52.289 --> 00:15:53.980
LAURA: Yeah, you're up!

436
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.568
MATT: You rolled high, buddy.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

437
00:15:56.568 --> 00:15:58.820
I'll go: Ah, ah, metal bull!

438
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.720
And I'll run this direction.

439
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.300
Actually, I'll fire off <i>three</i> Eldritch--

440
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.230
MATT: You remembered, yes.

441
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.490
TRAVIS: And then I'll take off running.

442
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.325
MATT: All right, go for it.

443
00:16:10.325 --> 00:16:11.483
TRAVIS: A-one, a-two--

444
00:16:11.483 --> 00:16:12.641
LIAM: Mr. Fjord.

445
00:16:12.641 --> 00:16:14.143
TRAVIS: -- a-three.

446
00:16:14.143 --> 00:16:15.718
LIAM: The Eldritch Blast does it.

447
00:16:15.718 --> 00:16:17.150
TRAVIS: Apparently, I get three now.

448
00:16:18.014 --> 00:16:18.847
MATT: Level up.
MARISHA: Into the center

449
00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:20.460
of a a co-mutated bull.

450
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.580
TRAVIS: That is a 16.

451
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.413
MATT: 16 misses.

452
00:16:22.413 --> 00:16:24.640
TRAVIS: Misses, second one.

453
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.190
Natural one.

454
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.710
MARISHA: Aw, come on.

455
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.380
TRAVIS: 22.

456
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.570
MATT: 22 does hit.

457
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.270
TRAVIS: Okay great, one of three.

458
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.400
MATT: The first one just glances off of its shoulders.

459
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.700
The second one just goes wide into the trees.

460
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.280
The third one does manage to
pierce it in the side of its shoulder.

461
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.980
TRAVIS: Nice, 14 points of force damage.

462
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.813
MATT: Got it.

463
00:16:44.813 --> 00:16:47.650
TRAVIS: And I will run my 30 feet--

464
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.483
MATT: This way?
TRAVIS: Yeah, in

465
00:16:48.483 --> 00:16:49.370
in the direction of Yasha.

466
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.190
And go: Jester, let's go!
MATT: You got it.

467
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.090
As they're splashing along the shoreline.

468
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.530
All righty, finishing Fjord's turn.

469
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.320
Jester, you're up, Caduceus, you're on deck.

470
00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.153
LAURA: Okay.

471
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.720
I'm going to, just to see what it does,

472
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.970
I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt at 3rd-level,

473
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.536
straight at the dude.

474
00:17:08.536 --> 00:17:09.769
MATT: Right there?
SAM: Right up the butt?

475
00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:12.860
MATT: Okay. From where you are right now,

476
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.640
has half cover, so just be aware of that.

477
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.390
LAURA: Can I shimmy over, so I can see him?

478
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.880
MATT: You go over to about there

479
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.240
and it will lose its half cover.

480
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.589
LAURA: All right.

481
00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.200
MATT: Because it's larger than them.

482
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.660
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to roll.

483
00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.620
TALIESIN: Perfect.

484
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.860
LAURA: (cheers)

485
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.953
29.

486
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.752
MATT: 29 will work.
LAURA: All right.

487
00:17:35.752 --> 00:17:37.020
TRAVIS: Lot of extra.

488
00:17:38.662 --> 00:17:40.770
LAURA: Seven, six.

489
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.810
I don't have my stuff organized.

490
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.918
♪ One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ♪

491
00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:47.168
LAURA and ASHLEY: ♪ nine, 10 ♪

492
00:17:47.168 --> 00:17:49.234
ALL: ♪ 11, 12 ♪

493
00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.300
MATT: What level did you cast that at? That was level--

494
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.320
LAURA: That was a 3rd-level.

495
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.620
MATT: You got it, roll for it.

496
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.200
LAURA: Aw, balls, eight, 10, 14, 16 points

497
00:17:59.838 --> 00:18:03.188
of radiant damage.
MATT: 16 points of radiant damage.

498
00:18:03.188 --> 00:18:05.023
MATT and LAURA: The next attack has advantage.

499
00:18:05.023 --> 00:18:06.387
MATT: It is now shining

500
00:18:06.387 --> 00:18:08.262
brightly from its current position.

501
00:18:08.262 --> 00:18:09.387
SAM: ♪ Shine bright like a diamond ♪

502
00:18:09.387 --> 00:18:11.600
LAURA: And then can I use the rest of my movement?

503
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.250
MATT: You can. You have 15 more feet.

504
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.463
LAURA: Can I back up into the water?

505
00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:16.296
MATT: Sure.

506
00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:18.110
And about there, that'll be the rest

507
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.580
because now you're in the water.

508
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.510
You can breathe water from the spell that was cast.

509
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.660
It's still half movement moving into it.

510
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.220
So about anything beyond that line right there

511
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.830
is going to be about-- it's 10 feet

512
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.180
of movement per square you move.

513
00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.013
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Just to be aware.

514
00:18:32.013 --> 00:18:33.260
TRAVIS: 10 feet per square.
MATT: Yes.

515
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.520
LAURA: Got it.

516
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.660
MATT: Your speed is halved, essentially.

517
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.740
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: All right,

518
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.272
that finishes Jester's turn.

519
00:18:39.272 --> 00:18:41.618
At the end of Jester's turn...

520
00:18:41.618 --> 00:18:43.257
TRAVIS: Is that it?

521
00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:45.090
MATT: At the end of Jester's turn, it's going to use one

522
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:50.030
of its legendary actions to use Defensive Shift

523
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.247
after being impacted, and it's going to move 15 feet.

524
00:18:53.247 --> 00:18:55.980
SAM: Oh, that's not so bad.
TRAVIS: Defensive Shift.

525
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.160
MATT: All right, Caduceus, your turn.

526
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.980
TALIESIN: First of all, (anxious muttering)

527
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.430
I'm going to--

528
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.250
this thing doesn't look that smart.

529
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.100
I'm going to use my bonus action to turn invisible

530
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.630
for one round.
MATT: All righty.

531
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.463
So you...

532
00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:20.800
SAM: Ca-hu-ceus.

533
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.701
MATT: You're ridiculous.
TRAVIS: Green smoke, right?

534
00:19:24.701 --> 00:19:27.423
So we probably shouldn't let it get near us at all.

535
00:19:27.423 --> 00:19:29.323
SAM: Green smoke?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

536
00:19:29.323 --> 00:19:30.156
SAM: That's not a good idea.

537
00:19:30.156 --> 00:19:32.173
TALIESIN: Because if any of us go down,
then I can't do anything,

538
00:19:32.173 --> 00:19:34.106
so I'd rather keep--
MATT: Pouring out of its nostrils

539
00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:35.490
and emanating from underneath

540
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.590
where its arms meet its armor

541
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:37.848
and through some of the gaps in it.

542
00:19:37.848 --> 00:19:39.589
TRAVIS: I don't want to be judgemental, but, you know.

543
00:19:39.589 --> 00:19:41.713
TALIESIN: No, I'd rather save options

544
00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:42.546
for when we go down.
SAM: In commercials, they don't use

545
00:19:42.546 --> 00:19:44.529
green smoke coming from the armpits

546
00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:46.570
to be good things.
TALIESIN: I'm going to start moving

547
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.320
in the diagonal direction towards the water

548
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.760
and about halfway there, when I've got three,

549
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.760
when I've got Nott, Beau and Jester.

550
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.130
Well, I've got Nott, Beau within, well--

551
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.963
LAURA: Yeah, it looks about equal.

552
00:19:58.963 --> 00:20:00.450
TALIESIN: Yeah, Nott, Beau, and Jester.

553
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.100
I'm going to cast...

554
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.480
Actually, not on you, I'm so sorry.

555
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.340
On myself, Nott, and Beau, I'm going to cast Bless.

556
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.293
MATT: All righty.

557
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.670
So Nott, Beau, and who else?

558
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.773
TALIESIN: Nott, Beau, and myself.
LAURA: Not me.

559
00:20:20.773 --> 00:20:22.150
TALIESIN: Well, that way I can keep it up

560
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.726
because I get the extra d4 to the save.

561
00:20:23.726 --> 00:20:25.934
TRAVIS: Selfish.
MATT: You got it.

562
00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.050
15 feet, you cast Bless

563
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.820
and you have 15 more feet if you want to.

564
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.290
TALIESIN: I'm going to head out and start getting

565
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.213
into the water and yeah, keep moving away from my family.

566
00:20:36.213 --> 00:20:38.360
MATT: That's as far as you can get right there.

567
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.970
All righty.
TALIESIN: Probably, if I can get,

568
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.720
yeah, if I can hide.
MATT: Okay.

569
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.910
You're invisible, so you're hiding pretty well.

570
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.510
That finishes Caduceus' turn. It is now

571
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.440
the creature's turn.

572
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.800
LIAM: Nope.
SAM: Here we go.

573
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.770
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: You are not going to move.

574
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.630
MATT: First--

575
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.880
LAURA: Moo!

576
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.785
MATT: -- it's going to go ahead (running footsteps)

577
00:20:58.785 --> 00:21:00.770
and it's going to move right up to Nott,

578
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:01.970
who's closest to it.

579
00:21:04.399 --> 00:21:06.200
As it rushes towards you, it's going to attempt

580
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.230
to make a gore attack.
LAURA: No! Can you use

581
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.370
your reaction to jump away from it?

582
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.160
SAM: I use my reaction to jump away from it.

583
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.010
MATT: That doesn't work, sorry.
(laughter)

584
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.040
That's a 21 to hit?

585
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.151
SAM: Yes.

586
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:20.841
TRAVIS: Quick, do you have a red cape?

587
00:21:20.841 --> 00:21:22.970
(laughter)

588
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.156
MATT: All right, and because it

589
00:21:25.156 --> 00:21:27.000
moved at least 20 feet straight ahead,

590
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.240
you need to make a strength saving throw for me,

591
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.037
if you don't mind.
TALIESIN: With an extra d4.

592
00:21:30.037 --> 00:21:33.008
SAM: Ooh. Thank you.

593
00:21:33.008 --> 00:21:35.890
LAURA: Ooh! That's helpful.

594
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.370
SAM: 15.
MATT: 15, fail.

595
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.957
You are knocked prone.
SAM: Okay, it trampled me.

596
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.580
MATT: And for the first, as it gores you with its horns

597
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.095
you take-- that's cocked.
LAURA: You're right at head level, too,

598
00:21:48.095 --> 00:21:51.200
so it made it extra gore-tastic.
SAM: (groaning)

599
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.800
MATT: 30 points of piercing damage.

600
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.530
SAM: Uncanny Dodge.
MATT: All right.

601
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.830
So you take 15--
LAURA: Can you Uncanny Dodge when you're prone?

602
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.110
MATT: Yeah, just a reaction to make it happen.

603
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.490
But it does get to make a hoof attack against you

604
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.480
as a bonus action.

605
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.537
TRAVIS: Hoof.
LIAM: Hoof!

606
00:22:07.537 --> 00:22:08.954
TRAVIS: We're a little slap happy.

607
00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:09.787
MARISHA: Yeah.

608
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.931
MATT: That'll be...

609
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.030
19 to hit.

610
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:17.863
SAM: Hits.

611
00:22:17.863 --> 00:22:21.010
MATT: All righty, then as it slams in you

612
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.970
and you scrape onto the ground. (grunts)

613
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.120
Hurt, trying to duck, you manage to duck out of the way

614
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.630
to miss it spearing the middle of your torso

615
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.580
and going after horrible organs and then all of a sudden

616
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.390
you look up and you see.

617
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.264
It slams down with its hooves onto you.

618
00:22:34.264 --> 00:22:36.430
You suffer...

619
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.824
You suffer!

620
00:22:37.824 --> 00:22:38.657
(laughter)

621
00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.190
TRAVIS: In general!

622
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:41.606
MATT: All right.

623
00:22:41.606 --> 00:22:43.247
19 points of bludgeoning damage.

624
00:22:43.247 --> 00:22:44.331
TRAVIS: Damn!

625
00:22:44.331 --> 00:22:47.430
This thing can hit hard!
LAURA: Jeez-uh!

626
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.400
MATT: And with the rest of its movement,

627
00:22:53.525 --> 00:22:57.333
it's going to go ahead and shift

628
00:22:57.333 --> 00:22:59.333
this way with its movement. It's going to--
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No!

629
00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:02.520
TRAVIS: Nein!
MATT: -- continue facing that right there.

630
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.320
That ends its turn. Beauregard, you're up.

631
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.580
Oh sorry, no, Yasha. Yasha is up

632
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.080
and then Beauregard and Nott.

633
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.670
ASHLEY: I would like to rage.
MATT: Okay.

634
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.820
ASHLEY: And then, I want to just
start running as much as I can.

635
00:23:15.856 --> 00:23:17.350
I'll just take that as the whole turn.

636
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.040
MATT: 30, 35, 40.

637
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.850
What's your movement?
ASHLEY: It is--

638
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.450
MATT: 40 feet?
ASHLEY: 40 feet, yeah.

639
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.950
MATT: That's your movement. You could use your action

640
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.170
to continue to run the rest of it

641
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.260
or you could--
ASHLEY: Yes.

642
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.690
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: I would like to do that.

643
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.940
SAM: Someone call Dr. Love.
MATT: 35.

644
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.256
So you are now right there.

645
00:23:32.256 --> 00:23:34.414
TALIESIN: Do you have a bonus action attack or no?

646
00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:37.680
ASHLEY: I wonder if I should do that, then.

647
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.230
MATT: It's not a bonus action attack, unfortunately.

648
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.221
ASHLEY: No, I'm just there.

649
00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:43.080
MATT: But you're there in front of it.
ASHLEY: I'm there in front of it.

650
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.490
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

651
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.323
MATT: You got it.

652
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.562
All righty.

653
00:23:47.562 --> 00:23:49.250
TALIESIN: It'll also use the--

654
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.278
Yeah, that's good, because that gives--

655
00:23:51.278 --> 00:23:53.370
ASHLEY: Yeah, it gives Beau advantage.
MARISHA: Yeah, are you flanking me?

656
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.010
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

657
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.890
MATT: Well, you can be flanking with it, technically.
TRAVIS: ♪ Flanking ♪

658
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.140
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn...

659
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.340
No, it's going to-- that's it.

660
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.590
All right, cool. That's your turn?

661
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.989
ASHLEY: That's my turn.
MATT: Beauregard, you're up.

662
00:24:03.989 --> 00:24:06.922
LAURA: Do we wait for--
MARISHA: I know, what to not do.

663
00:24:06.922 --> 00:24:09.596
TALIESIN: It's made of tricks.
We're going to-- it's terrible.

664
00:24:09.596 --> 00:24:11.850
MATT: It's a piñata, guys. Get candy.

665
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.830
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to run
up to it and flank with Yasha.

666
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.663
MATT: All righty.

667
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.730
Go for it.

668
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.267
Flank there, all righty.

669
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:27.330
LIAM: This thing's going to fart on you both.

670
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.620
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

671
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.318
Ach! I'm going to, like, you know, try and stay up top--

672
00:24:33.318 --> 00:24:36.239
(laughter)
with my hits!

673
00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:40.220
Like, I want to avoid the spleen--

674
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.830
Try go for the top.
MATT: And see these

675
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.980
these odd, long quills,

676
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.190
that seem to be pushing out of underneath

677
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.930
where its body armor is. The armor's bending

678
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.270
in awkward ways. What looks--
LAURA: I don't like him.

679
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.460
MATT: It looks a little wrong in its design.

680
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.598
But go for it, make your attacks.

681
00:24:54.598 --> 00:24:58.140
MARISHA: I'm going to go for what look like the weak spots.

682
00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.390
MATT: Sure, in between the metal.

683
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.223
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Do it. Do your attacks.

684
00:25:00.223 --> 00:25:01.960
MATT: Yeah, I'm doing it, I'm doing that.

685
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.230
MATT: So you have two attacks, action.

686
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.381
TALIESIN: You can add a d4 to both of those, too.
MARISHA: Which is good.

687
00:25:05.381 --> 00:25:06.214
MATT: Because you're Blessed.

688
00:25:07.176 --> 00:25:09.240
MARISHA: For that one and that one.

689
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.275
Okay, 26.
MATT: 26.

690
00:25:12.275 --> 00:25:14.400
MARISHA: And then... 15.

691
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.948
MATT: 15 misses.
MARISHA: Which I believe misses.

692
00:25:17.432 --> 00:25:18.820
MATT: One of them, you strike it hits the metal plate.

693
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.130
And the other one you manage to pierce in between

694
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.629
two of the plate and hits a little more softer.
LAURA: Did you take advantage on it?

695
00:25:23.629 --> 00:25:25.200
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Do I have advantage?

696
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.270
LAURA: No, you already got advantage because--

697
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.220
LIAM: Oh, that was two attacks.
MARISHA: Ooh, oh, I didn't.

698
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.220
MATT: So that'd be your first attack,

699
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.770
so roll for a second attack now.

700
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.820
MARISHA: Okay, that's much better.

701
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.300
Roll another d4. 25.

702
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.900
MATT: Okay, both hit.

703
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.550
Roll damage for each.
MARISHA: Thank you.

704
00:25:40.869 --> 00:25:43.210
Okay, that's good.

705
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.830
Guiding Bolt, oh, Guiding Bolt.

706
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.850
That's why I have an advantage.

707
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.346
MATT: Also, you're flanking with Yasha.

708
00:25:49.346 --> 00:25:52.920
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: So its like triple-y--

709
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.980
TRAVIS: That's just natural.

710
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.100
MARISHA: 13 damage on the first one

711
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:02.630
and... sorry,

712
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.290
11 damage on the second.
MATT: Got it.

713
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.240
As (grunts) each impact hits, you pull back

714
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.690
and with each blow against his body,

715
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.390
the sections between the metal plates

716
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:20.320
emits that green gas that you saw trailing behind it.

717
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.040
Nott, Yasha and Beauregard are all adjacent to it.

718
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.710
You all suffer eight points of poison damage.

719
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.650
TALIESIN: You don't though.
MARISHA: I can't be poisoned.

720
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.610
MATT: Right, so you take no damage. Both you guys

721
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.250
take eight points of poison damage from the first attack.

722
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.410
SAM: First?
MATT: And the second attack

723
00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:33.760
deals six points of poison damage.

724
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.632
SAM: Every time we attack it?

725
00:26:35.632 --> 00:26:37.720
TRAVIS: Just melee attacks, right?
TALIESIN: If you're right next to it.

726
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.580
TRAVIS: It didn't happen when the Eldritch Blast did it.

727
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.870
MATT: It didn't seem to hit with an Eldritch Blaster.

728
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.730
LAURA: Like magic can do.
SAM: And how far,

729
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.590
well, how far did it look like the gas?

730
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.810
MATT: Just around it, immediately around it.

731
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.596
SAM: Okay, okay.

732
00:26:49.596 --> 00:26:51.283
MATT: You have a bonus action.

733
00:26:51.283 --> 00:26:52.760
MARISHA: Patient Defense.

734
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.530
MATT: Okay, you got it.

735
00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.750
All right.
SAM: That was a mature decision, Beau.

736
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.690
MATT: All right.

737
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.670
At the at the end of Beau's turn,

738
00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:08.600
it's going to go ahead and
use two of its legendary actions--

739
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.130
LAURA: Two of them?!

740
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.680
MATT: -- to tighten its armor.
TRAVIS: To tighten?

741
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.040
MATT: So now, you watch as the plates around its body

742
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.990
seize up and condense, the quills themselves bending back

743
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.520
and it looks like it almost hurts it to do so,

744
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.700
but it seems to be a little more fortified

745
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.624
for the time being.
LAURA: Does it looks like

746
00:27:26.624 --> 00:27:28.590
the plates are part of it,

747
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.400
like, they're part of the body.
MATT: Like they've grown out

748
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.875
of it naturally, but also weirdly,

749
00:27:33.875 --> 00:27:35.510
you haven't quite seen a creature like this before.

750
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.720
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

751
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.180
MATT: That finishes Beauregard's turn.

752
00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.030
Nott, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

753
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.250
SAM: Shit.

754
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.453
I will use half movement to stand up

755
00:27:44.453 --> 00:27:45.286
MATT: All righty.

756
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:51.367
SAM: And sort of brush the hook marks off of me.

757
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.720
It's right next to me, so I guess

758
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.650
I should bonus action disengage.

759
00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:58.766
MATT: If you'd like to.

760
00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:00.550
SAM: Yes.

761
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.860
I would like to.
MATT: Okay.

762
00:28:03.195 --> 00:28:06.042
SAM: And then-- shit.

763
00:28:06.042 --> 00:28:07.840
How do I not get killed by this thing?

764
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.933
LAURA: Can you run up a tree?
MATT: That's a good question.

765
00:28:09.933 --> 00:28:11.191
SAM: I can run up a tree.

766
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.810
MATT: If you'd like to.

767
00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.560
SAM: How tall is that tree?

768
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.400
MATT: Oh, that tree's about, I'd say, 20, 25 feet.

769
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.010
But the lower branches are about 10 feet off the ground.

770
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.240
MATT: But how much movement, I only have half movement.

771
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.970
So I have--
MATT: You have 15 feet left.

772
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.490
MATT: And I'm, like, 10 feet--
MATT: Or I'd say 20.

773
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.270
Your speed's 35, right?
SAM: 35, yeah.

774
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.880
MATT: I'll say 15 to 20.

775
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.730
SAM: But it's 10 feet to get the tree, at least, right?

776
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.880
SAM: That's about, yeah.
LAURA: You might be able

777
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.840
to get to the bottom branch.

778
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.460
SAM: Might, I might...

779
00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:52.410
Instead, I will run that way.

780
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.793
MATT: This way?

781
00:28:53.793 --> 00:28:56.160
SAM: 15 feet.
MATT: At a diagonal?

782
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.430
SAM: Yeah, and then cast Levitate and go 20 feet up.

783
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.090
LAURA: Oh, shit.

784
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.897
MATT: Okay, so you (floating).

785
00:29:03.897 --> 00:29:05.566
Lift up off the ground.
SAM: Yeah.

786
00:29:05.566 --> 00:29:07.525
LIAM: Like bike pedal into the air.

787
00:29:07.525 --> 00:29:08.358
MATT: Okay.

788
00:29:08.358 --> 00:29:10.858
LAURA: (panicked yelling)

789
00:29:10.858 --> 00:29:13.233
TALIESIN: How hard is it to Extract Aspects at some point?

790
00:29:13.233 --> 00:29:14.380
MARISHA: I just--
LIAM: Arcane Trickster.

791
00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.500
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.
MARISHA: I'm going to have

792
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.233
to do Flurry of Blows, but I

793
00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:18.723
didn't want to give them--
MATT: All righty.

794
00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:20.770
That's pretty cool, actually.

795
00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:21.953
MARISHA: But yeah.

796
00:29:21.953 --> 00:29:22.869
TALIESIN: I was just curious.

797
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.670
This is nerve-wracking.

798
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.880
SAM: Levitate from which one?

799
00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:35.520
LAURA: (whispering) What am I doing, what am I doing?

800
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.340
SAM: What'd you say?
MATT: Levitate.

801
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.450
SAM: Oh, at the only level I have, level two.

802
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.403
TRAVIS: ♪ The only level I have ♪

803
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:50.441
[Inaudible] It's all I got.

804
00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:54.380
MATT: Do you have Levitate?

805
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.990
SAM: I got it, it's on my list.

806
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:03.640
It was an option for me on D&amp;D Beyond, a company I love.

807
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.384
MATT: That's true, just double checking.

808
00:30:06.384 --> 00:30:08.870
TRAVIS and LAURA: ♪ D&amp;D ♪

809
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.814
SAM: ♪ (low-pitched) D&amp;D Beyond. ♪

810
00:30:10.814 --> 00:30:11.864
LAURA: ♪ It's D&amp;D ♪

811
00:30:11.864 --> 00:30:15.093
TRAVIS: You got the husky, sexy voice tonight.
ASHLEY: ♪ Got the perfect warlock. ♪

812
00:30:15.093 --> 00:30:17.424
SAM: ♪ (stilted) You got the perfect warlock. ♪

813
00:30:17.424 --> 00:30:19.864
(laughter)

814
00:30:19.864 --> 00:30:21.320
SAM: Uh oh!

815
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.880
Matt's criticizing my spell choice.

816
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: "Each of these spells

817
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.200
"must be enchantment or illusion."

818
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.170
SAM: That's-- oh, it does say transmutation.

819
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.570
They offered it to me, did not know that...

820
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.720
I couldn't have it.
LAURA: Oh no!

821
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.840
MATT: "Spells you on at 8th, 14th and 20th level

822
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.060
"can be from any school of magic."

823
00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.029
So that's probably when you chose it.

824
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:45.610
So you're good, just double checking,

825
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.161
double checking, you're good, you're good.

826
00:30:47.161 --> 00:30:48.000
TRAVIS: It's good to know.

827
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.130
LAURA: Oh, man.
TRAVIS: Just to be sure.

828
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.610
LIAM: That is one of the three rules of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

829
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.460
There's three.
SAM: That's right, that's right.

830
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.750
LIAM: We finally learned the last one.

831
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.583
MATT: Perfect. So all right.

832
00:30:58.583 --> 00:31:01.860
As you rush off to the side,
you went ahead and cast the spell.

833
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.720
lift up off the ground. You're now floating

834
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.070
in the air above, looking down at this creature,

835
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.060
your friends pincering it from that side

836
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.550
and the scattering statues

837
00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.360
that sit amongst the beach side of the oasis

838
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.110
in the red earth--
SAM: It's really nice up here, guys.

839
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:16.990
MATT: All right, Nott, that's end of your turn?

840
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.740
SAM: Uh-huh.
MATT: Caleb, you're up. Fjord, you're on deck.

841
00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.880
LIAM: Caleb, very frustrated to have his first

842
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.032
foray shrugged off is going to move forward.

843
00:31:25.032 --> 00:31:26.760
I want to put him here.
MATT: Right there?

844
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.710
LIAM: Here, let's say here.

845
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.934
I need a clear line of sight. He digs into his bag

846
00:31:30.934 --> 00:31:34.190
and pulls out a lodestone, which he palms in his hand

847
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:37.350
and drags some minerals and dust up his entire arm

848
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.380
and points his finger and I cast Disintegrate

849
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.826
at this thing.
MATT: At this thing?

850
00:31:42.826 --> 00:31:44.817
LIAM: Dex save.
MATT: A dex save.

851
00:31:46.776 --> 00:31:47.951
Oh, it's cocked.

852
00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.510
No, that is an eight.

853
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:54.977
Go ahead and roll some damage on that.

854
00:31:54.977 --> 00:31:56.828
MARISHA: Hey.

855
00:31:56.828 --> 00:31:59.059
TALIESIN: (nervous warbling)

856
00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:00.690
Thank you, Caleb.

857
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.280
LIAM: That is 68 points of force damage.

858
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.490
ALL: Whoa!

859
00:32:06.447 --> 00:32:08.687
SAM: He's been castrated.

860
00:32:08.687 --> 00:32:09.521
LIAM: And then I pull--

861
00:32:09.521 --> 00:32:11.910
MATT: You blast it with the ray.

862
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.600
You watch some of the metal just rust away on its body,

863
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.260
exposing parts of its flesh, this like...

864
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.370
a grayish musculature underneath, but where that burns away

865
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.350
you can see where the fume is coming from

866
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.707
this bright green, neon liquid

867
00:32:25.707 --> 00:32:27.739
you would assume is its blood.

868
00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:28.572
SAM: (groans)

869
00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:29.940
LIAM: And then I'm just going to dance

870
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.500
my last 10 feet diagonally back towards the water

871
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.210
and away from Caduceus' family.

872
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.720
MATT: All right, you got it.
LIAM: That's it.

873
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.760
MARISHA: Beau just turns over her shoulder with a little bit

874
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.368
of hair burning.

875
00:32:39.368 --> 00:32:40.985
MATT: All right, at the end of Caleb's turn,

876
00:32:40.985 --> 00:32:42.785
it's going to go ahead and use

877
00:32:42.785 --> 00:32:45.550
its last legendary action to use Defensive Shift.

878
00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.190
One, two, three.

879
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.290
TRAVIS: Shit.

880
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:51.964
MATT: All right.

881
00:32:51.964 --> 00:32:53.471
MARISHA: Does Yasha and I--

882
00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.088
ASHLEY: Yeah, do we get a little bit of

883
00:32:55.088 --> 00:32:58.285
MATT: No, because it moves without
triggering opportunity attacks when it does that.

884
00:32:58.285 --> 00:32:59.867
ASHLEY: (hisses)
LIAM: What is it about a game of dice

885
00:32:59.867 --> 00:33:02.575
that is making me literally hand shake?

886
00:33:02.575 --> 00:33:04.980
It's just dice.
LAURA: It's so nerveracking!

887
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.127
MARISHA: Stakes are very high.
MATT: Whatcha doing, Fjord?

888
00:33:07.127 --> 00:33:09.890
TRAVIS: Can you move diagonally--
is it like this, bump, bump, bump?

889
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:10.780
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

890
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.887
Can I move diagonally in his direction, 30 feet?

891
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.866
MATT: 25, 30. Right there.

892
00:33:17.866 --> 00:33:19.866
TRAVIS: Does that put me within--

893
00:33:19.866 --> 00:33:21.700
He's still out of range, isn't he?

894
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.270
He's more than 30 feet away.

895
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:28.140
I'll fire three more Eldritch Blasts in his direction.

896
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:28.973
MATT: Go for it.

897
00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:31.320
LIAM: Pew pew!
TALIESIN: Pew pew.

898
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.245
TRAVIS: God fucking anus!

899
00:33:33.245 --> 00:33:35.900
11.
MATT: 11 misses.

900
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.553
TRAVIS: 23?
MATT: 23 misses.

901
00:33:37.553 --> 00:33:38.619
LAURA: (gasps)
ASHLEY: What?!

902
00:33:38.619 --> 00:33:39.894
MATT: And that last one's a miss, too.
LIAM: Because he's beefed up.

903
00:33:39.894 --> 00:33:40.727
Because his armor--
ASHLEY: Because he's beefed up right now.

904
00:33:40.727 --> 00:33:41.685
LAURA: Oh, because he did

905
00:33:41.685 --> 00:33:43.680
the tightening move, motherfucker!

906
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.813
TRAVIS: All three miss, all three miss.

907
00:33:45.813 --> 00:33:46.760
LAURA and LIAM: Aw!

908
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.110
MATT: Two of them hit and then (poofing).

909
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.020
No impact, no damage, just little dark scuff

910
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.171
of the eldritch power leaving residual nothing.

911
00:33:55.171 --> 00:33:57.170
TRAVIS: ♪ Fuck you ♪

912
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.660
SAM: That is some <i>bull</i>shit.

913
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.750
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

914
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.670
MATT: Jester, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

915
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.656
LAURA: Okay, jeez louise!

916
00:34:09.656 --> 00:34:12.278
MARISHA: So if you don't roll, like...
LAURA: (sighs)

917
00:34:12.278 --> 00:34:14.310
LIAM: Or do things that don't involve AC.

918
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.385
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Magic.

919
00:34:15.385 --> 00:34:18.533
MATT: Which is not what I do.
LAURA: That was what I was planning on doing.

920
00:34:18.533 --> 00:34:21.268
I'm going to use my movement to climb up the rock.

921
00:34:21.268 --> 00:34:23.140
Can I climb up the rock next to it?

922
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.590
MATT: Yeah, I can definitely allow that, definitely.

923
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:27.780
That'll be...

924
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.853
Make an athletics check for me.

925
00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:35.170
Well, you know what-- Yeah, just make an athletics check.

926
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.900
LAURA: Natural 20.

927
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.217
MATT: Oh, you're fine.

928
00:34:40.217 --> 00:34:43.270
LAURA: ♪ I wish I would've been rolling something else! ♪

929
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:44.436
Okay,

930
00:34:44.436 --> 00:34:49.436
and I'm going to cast--

931
00:34:49.636 --> 00:34:51.840
Aw, jeez.

932
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.640
MATT: That's-- what level's that?

933
00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.162
LAURA: Aw, jeez.

934
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.717
Oh that's, yes, I'm okay, I'm sorry.

935
00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.710
This is so much harder now that

936
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.413
I know that he's hard to hit.

937
00:35:05.413 --> 00:35:07.663
MARISHA: He still has two legendary resistances.

938
00:35:07.663 --> 00:35:08.923
MATT: He's lost one.

939
00:35:08.923 --> 00:35:10.989
MARISHA: That's one-- (mumbling)

940
00:35:10.989 --> 00:35:12.310
TRAVIS: Do they come back every round?

941
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.340
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.
ASHLEY: That wasn't two?

942
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.426
MARISHA: It's got legendary actions.

943
00:35:15.426 --> 00:35:17.599
LIAM: Legendary Actions, which is
different than Legendary Resistances.

944
00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:19.109
ASHLEY: I understand; that is correct.
LIAM: Slow burn one of those.

945
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:23.490
LAURA: I'm going to use Invoke Duplicity

946
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:24.510
as an action.

947
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.520
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: All right, so you go ahead and

948
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.710
inflicts your Jester duplicate-- where?

949
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.550
LAURA: I'm going to go as far away from me as I can

950
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.675
towards the--

951
00:35:32.675 --> 00:35:33.883
MATT: What's the range you can have on that?

952
00:35:35.157 --> 00:35:36.316
LAURA: Yes.

953
00:35:36.316 --> 00:35:37.700
It is

954
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.691
30 feet. Within 30 feet of me.

955
00:35:39.691 --> 00:35:42.425
MATT: 20, 25, 30, that would be the furthest you can get it.

956
00:35:42.425 --> 00:35:44.308
LAURA: And then from my bonus action,

957
00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:46.900
I'm going to cast Healing Word

958
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.530
at a lame-o 1st-level on Nott.

959
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.980
MATT: Okay, what's the range on that?

960
00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.440
LAURA: 60 feet.
MATT: Yeah, Nott's within range.

961
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.820
And you guys are eye-level now, actually,

962
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.880
because you're up on this tall, spire-like rock

963
00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.920
and Nott's just floating in the air.

964
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.753
SAM: Whee!

965
00:36:02.753 --> 00:36:05.753
LAURA: Okay, so that's eight points of healing.

966
00:36:05.753 --> 00:36:07.210
MATT: That's not bad.
SAM: Thank you.

967
00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:08.276
MATT: That's not bad.

968
00:36:08.276 --> 00:36:10.537
SAM: A rare Healing Word!
MATT: That finishes, Jester?

969
00:36:10.537 --> 00:36:12.870
LAURA: Yeah, that's all I can do.
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

970
00:36:13.724 --> 00:36:16.670
TALIESIN: (sighs)

971
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.587
That thing's hard to hit right now.

972
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:22.623
Okay.

973
00:36:23.493 --> 00:36:25.250
Five, 10.

974
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.677
LAURA: 23 doesn't hit!

975
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.278
TALIESIN: I'm now visible again.

976
00:36:30.278 --> 00:36:31.111
MATT: That's right.

977
00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.210
TALIESIN: Eeny meeny miney mo.
LAURA: I mean, you can try.

978
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.155
TALIESIN: It's just probably hard to hit.
LAURA: If you roll a natural 20, you'll hit it.

979
00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:40.424
MATT: All righty, then.

980
00:36:40.424 --> 00:36:43.357
TALIESIN: I'm going to get as close to within 30 feet--

981
00:36:43.357 --> 00:36:45.690
I'm going to get within 30 feet to try and get as close

982
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.100
as I can to throw something at him before

983
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.430
I can back off again.

984
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:49.460
MATT: Okay, which way do want to go for that?

985
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.070
TALIESIN: Like, directly towards him and then

986
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.880
I'm going to, like, scoot back.
MATT: Towards him? So five--

987
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.280
TALIESIN: That's 30 feet. Oh, yeah, we're way--

988
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.165
MATT: Like, right there is 30 feet.
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 30 feet, right?

989
00:36:57.165 --> 00:36:57.998
MATT: Yep.
TALIESIN: Okay,

990
00:36:57.998 --> 00:36:58.950
and I'm going to cast...

991
00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:01.356
I'm going to do something.

992
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.345
I'm going to--
LAURA: Sorry, I was on slow on my turn, Matt.

993
00:37:05.345 --> 00:37:07.170
TALIESIN: I'm going to do use Channel Divinity--

994
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:08.278
MATT: Okay.

995
00:37:08.278 --> 00:37:11.211
TALIESIN: -- to do Path to the Grave.

996
00:37:12.117 --> 00:37:13.850
MATT: Path to the Grave, which--

997
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.360
TALIESIN: The next time one of my allies hits the creature

998
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.950
with an attack, the creature has vulnerability

999
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.290
to all the attack's damage.

1000
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.650
MATT: You got it. All right, cool.
TALIESIN: And now I'm backing the fuck off.

1001
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.584
MATT: All right.

1002
00:37:22.584 --> 00:37:25.200
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1003
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.490
TALIESIN: Like, kind of behind the trees.

1004
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.700
Yeah, like, the--
MATT: Over there?

1005
00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.916
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, cool.

1006
00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:30.438
TRAVIS: In between you and it?

1007
00:37:30.438 --> 00:37:31.690
MATT: That finishes your turn?
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

1008
00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.373
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: I'm trying to be a good cleric.

1009
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.460
LAURA: I don't want to be a good cleric, I want to hit him.

1010
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.490
TALIESIN: That's why I--
MATT: All right, on this turn, it

1011
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.510
(inhales)

1012
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.450
inhales as its armor extends once more,

1013
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.360
gets all of its legendary actions left.

1014
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.610
(inhales)

1015
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.080
You watch the armor plates splitting as it begins

1016
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.810
to inhale and that fume that was spilling out,

1017
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.003
stops giving out, and then it

1018
00:37:57.003 --> 00:38:00.500
(roars) unleashes

1019
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:04.142
a torrent of it out--
ASHLEY: Bye, bye.

1020
00:38:04.142 --> 00:38:05.260
MATT: -- this way.

1021
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.623
MARISHA: Am I, like-- Can I [Inaudible] Just out of range?

1022
00:38:08.623 --> 00:38:09.624
LAURA: It probably does.

1023
00:38:09.624 --> 00:38:11.727
MATT: See here, I'll say, because it's at [inaudible] here.

1024
00:38:11.727 --> 00:38:12.880
TALIESIN: You do get to add a d4

1025
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.534
to your save, though.
LIAM: Everybody freeze.

00:38:17.779 --> 00:38:18.945
TALIESIN: Maybe poison.

1028
00:38:19.943 --> 00:38:22.850
MATT: It's pretty tight there, let me see.

1029
00:38:23.854 --> 00:38:26.307
MARISHA: [Inaudible] Go from there.

1030
00:38:26.307 --> 00:38:27.140
TRAVIS: Punk.

1031
00:38:28.083 --> 00:38:31.093
MATT: That's pretty close.
SAM: I'll take it. It's fine! It's fun!

1032
00:38:31.093 --> 00:38:33.208
It's a game.
MATT: It's pretty close. Ah!

1033
00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:34.041
LIAM: It's out!

1034
00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:36.415
It ain't within!
SAM: It's fine!

1035
00:38:36.415 --> 00:38:38.269
MATT: I feel like if the tip is there--

1036
00:38:38.269 --> 00:38:39.662
SAM: Give me the damage, it's fine!

1037
00:38:39.662 --> 00:38:42.340
LAURA: It's over the square.
LIAM: Okay, okay.

1038
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:46.222
MATT: That's just on the edge, I need Nott,

1039
00:38:46.222 --> 00:38:49.082
Beauregard, and Yasha to roll constitution saving throws

1040
00:38:49.082 --> 00:38:50.201
for me, please.
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, okay.

1041
00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:51.460
SAM: With a plus four?
TALIESIN: Yeah,

1042
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.110
you and Beau got plus four.

1043
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:55.632
SAM: I'm fine, guys.
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

1044
00:38:55.632 --> 00:38:57.124
MATT: Nice!
LAURA: Yay!

1045
00:38:57.124 --> 00:38:58.230
MARISHA: Natural one.

1046
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.730
ALL: Ooh.

1047
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:00.680
TALIESIN: With your d4?

1048
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.513
SAM: 23.

1049
00:39:01.513 --> 00:39:02.713
MARISHA: If it's poison.

1050
00:39:02.713 --> 00:39:03.720
Is it poison?
MATT: It's not poison.

1051
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.270
LIAM: No, it's stone, man.

1052
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:06.670
MATT: You are restrained, Beauregard.

1053
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.610
You find your body suddenly beginning to lock up

1054
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:09.480
in places--
LAURA: Oh no, oh no.

1055
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.780
We're going to be paralyzed.
MATT: Your skin turning

1056
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.800
slightly gray on the edges

1057
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.700
of your elbows and--

1058
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.058
LIAM: And it's directly in front of her and can smash her.

1059
00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:19.160
LAURA: Oh no, oh no!

1060
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.660
TALIESIN: Paralysis takes a minute to fully kick

1061
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.460
in, though, right, or?
MATT: You don't know.

1062
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.470
TALIESIN: I don't know. Okay.

1063
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.303
LAURA: Oh no!

1064
00:39:25.303 --> 00:39:28.355
MARISHA: Restrained.
MATT: You are restrained at the moment.

1065
00:39:28.355 --> 00:39:31.013
SAM: She's restrained.

1066
00:39:31.013 --> 00:39:33.020
Do we see a physical change in her body?

1067
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.850
LAURA: She turning gray!
SAM: She's turned gray.

1068
00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:35.683
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Okay.

1069
00:39:35.683 --> 00:39:38.191
MARISHA: You hear me start going: Fuck, fuck!

1070
00:39:38.191 --> 00:39:40.875
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1071
00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:41.770
MATT: And with that...

1072
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:45.543
he's going to go ahead and--

1073
00:39:45.543 --> 00:39:47.007
TRAVIS: Well, that changes stuff.

1074
00:39:47.007 --> 00:39:48.410
MARISHA: Fucking-- god--

1075
00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:49.280
TALIESIN: (whispers) Thank you.

1076
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.658
TRAVIS: You're not gray yet, though.

1077
00:39:50.658 --> 00:39:51.491
MARISHA: No.

1078
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.730
MATT: And rush up towards Caleb.

1079
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.410
You do get an attack of opportunity against it.

1080
00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.500
But with disadvantage, because you are restrained

1081
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.027
TALIESIN: But with a d4.
MARISHA: Huh, but what?

1082
00:40:00.027 --> 00:40:01.210
MATT: With disadvantage, because you are restrained.

1083
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.557
LIAM: With a d4. Yeah, roll again, disadvantage.

1084
00:40:05.523 --> 00:40:09.010
MARISHA: Okay, come on, come on, 25.

1085
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:09.843
MATT: 25 hits.

1086
00:40:09.843 --> 00:40:11.281
(cheering)

1087
00:40:11.281 --> 00:40:14.510
As it tries to rush towards Caleb,

1088
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.026
you go ahead and sweep out its front leg and it

1089
00:40:17.026 --> 00:40:18.159
skids into the dirt.

1090
00:40:18.159 --> 00:40:20.440
Its back legs kicked up for a second and it

1091
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.050
has to right itself and shake the dust off.

1092
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:23.130
MARISHA: Sentinel!

1093
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:23.990
MATT: Yep.

1094
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.823
MARISHA: Oh, is that what you were describing?

1095
00:40:24.823 --> 00:40:26.730
MATT: Yeah, I was just describing was you tripping it up.

1096
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.215
So yes, you're right! What's the damage on that?

1097
00:40:29.215 --> 00:40:30.090
MARISHA: 10.

1098
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:33.586
TALIESIN: Doubled. 10 doubled.

1099
00:40:33.586 --> 00:40:35.440
MATT: That's right, 20 points.

1100
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.146
SAM: Why?
TALIESIN: Because I cast a spell

1101
00:40:38.146 --> 00:40:40.220
that doubled the damage of the next hit.
SAM: Cool.

1102
00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.520
MATT: All righty. It angrily spins back in this direction

1103
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.748
and glaring at you.

1104
00:40:44.748 --> 00:40:45.581
(breathes heavily)

1105
00:40:45.581 --> 00:40:48.680
MARISHA: I look at my arm that's slowly, like, petrifying

1106
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.689
and I'm like: Hmm!

1107
00:40:51.689 --> 00:40:52.938
MATT: All righty, that finishes its turn.

1108
00:40:52.938 --> 00:40:54.380
Yasha, you're up. Beau, you're on deck.

1109
00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.710
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to start with...

1110
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.260
I'm going to unleash a battle cry

1111
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.310
so that everybody has advantage on your attack rolls

1112
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.440
and saving throws

1113
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.365
for this round.
MATT: For this round.

1114
00:41:09.365 --> 00:41:10.723
LAURA: Attack rolls and saving throws?!

1115
00:41:10.723 --> 00:41:12.755
ASHLEY and MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Anybody who can hear you?

1116
00:41:12.755 --> 00:41:14.255
ASHLEY: Yeah, and within 60 feet,

1117
00:41:14.255 --> 00:41:16.090
so I think everybody's within 60 feet.

1118
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:16.923
MATT: Yeah, it's everybody, yeah.

1119
00:41:16.923 --> 00:41:18.420
ASHLEY: Okay, great.

1120
00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.120
So I would like to go up to him.

1121
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.730
MATT: Okay.

1122
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:24.930
ASHLEY: If I can flank with...

1123
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.300
MATT: 30, 35.

1124
00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:33.470
ASHLEY: Yeah?

1125
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.710
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1126
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.500
And then I would--
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of everybody.

1127
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.670
ASHLEY: Any openings I can see,
I want to try to get in there.

1128
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.753
MATT: Sure, go for it.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1129
00:41:44.943 --> 00:41:48.860
It's cocked. I'm really sorry, but I get advantage.

1130
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.460
MATT: You do.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1131
00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.170
I don't know if this'll hit. Shit!

1132
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.840
20 total.
MATT: 20 just hits.

1133
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.860
ALL: Ooh!
TALIESIN: Good to know.

1134
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:03.165
LAURA: His thing isn't still in defense mode or whatever?

1135
00:42:03.165 --> 00:42:04.250
MATT: No.

1136
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.393
That lasts until its next turn.
LAURA: Okay.

1137
00:42:06.393 --> 00:42:08.730
ASHLEY: I'm going to roll Savage Attack.

1138
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.730
So that's seven.

1139
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.806
SAM: Reckless. Savage!
ASHLEY: That's a little better.

1140
00:42:12.806 --> 00:42:13.839
LAURA: No, not Reckless.
SAM: Berserk!

1141
00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:17.125
ASHLEY: 19 points of damage for the first hit.
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on!

1142
00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:19.670
MATT: Okay, as the gas expands from its body

1143
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.477
as soon as you impact, it (sprays) into you and you (coughs)

1144
00:42:22.477 --> 00:42:24.930
cough it off, but you take six points of poison damage.

1145
00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.030
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: Damn.

1146
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.863
TALIESIN: You're fine, you're fine.

1147
00:42:26.863 --> 00:42:28.546
SAM: Every time, this is a--
TALIESIN: Tank.

1148
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:30.310
ASHLEY: All right, I'll go again.

1149
00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:32.460
LAURA: Brush it off, that's nothing.

1150
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.072
MATT: With advantage, don't forget.
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

1151
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:40.740
Yeah, okay, that would be a 22.

1152
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.217
MATT: 22 hits, go ahead and roll damage.
ASHLEY: Sorry.

1153
00:42:42.217 --> 00:42:45.280
LAURA: (laughs)

1154
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.630
ASHLEY: Okay, that's six. I'll try again.

1155
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.390
Okay that was better.
MARISHA: You, evil laughing

1156
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.785
with croissant is like--

1157
00:42:52.785 --> 00:42:54.719
MATT: The best villain.
ASHLEY: 14 points of damage.

1158
00:42:54.719 --> 00:42:55.940
MATT: 14, nice.

1159
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.950
You take 11 points of poison damage from that impact.

1160
00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:00.600
ASHLEY: 11 points just from that one, or total?

1161
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.650
MATT: Just from that one.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1162
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.100
MATT: So with each of these impacts,
the poison sprays onto your skin

1163
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.140
and burns into the flesh and you're like (grunts),

1164
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.665
having pull back, your eyes are squinting

1165
00:43:08.665 --> 00:43:11.730
because it's starting to burn your eyes as you pull away.

1166
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:13.422
But you managed to take some decent hits at it

1167
00:43:13.422 --> 00:43:15.350
and you could see, like, big sections of its back

1168
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.780
are gashed and metal plates are bent in

1169
00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.144
and bleeding that green ooze out of it.

1170
00:43:19.144 --> 00:43:20.500
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: That finishes your turn?

1171
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.030
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Beauregard, you're up.

1172
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.535
Nott, you're on deck.

1173
00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:26.674
MARISHA: Trying to take advantage of the fact that

1174
00:43:26.674 --> 00:43:30.430
I'm slowly losing feeling of my right arm,

1175
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.808
I'm just going to, like, right haymaker, right haymaker,

1176
00:43:33.808 --> 00:43:35.190
and crack into this guy.

1177
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.263
MATT: Go for it.

1178
00:43:36.263 --> 00:43:37.435
With disadvantage.

1179
00:43:37.435 --> 00:43:39.104
TALIESIN: With a d4.

1180
00:43:39.104 --> 00:43:40.920
MATT: You have disadvantage, but you're technically flanked

1181
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.450
with Yasha, so it's just a single attack, so both of those

1182
00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:43.693
are your two attacks.
MARISHA: So both of those are my rolls,

1183
00:43:43.693 --> 00:43:46.009
which is what I was going for. Natural 20 on the first one.

1184
00:43:46.009 --> 00:43:47.648
MATT: Nice!
MARISHA: And I have a d4?

1185
00:43:47.648 --> 00:43:48.648
This isn't-- I just don't--

1186
00:43:48.648 --> 00:43:50.420
Oh, maybe it will.

1187
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.537
21.
MATT: That hits.

1188
00:43:51.537 --> 00:43:54.340
ASHLEY: Yes!
MARISHA: It makes it, it just makes it.

1189
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.248
Rolled an eight.

1190
00:43:55.248 --> 00:43:57.158
MATT: So the first-- roll damage for the crit.

1191
00:43:57.158 --> 00:43:58.890
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

1192
00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:01.748
LIAM: Is Beauregard visibly stoning?

1193
00:44:01.748 --> 00:44:03.305
MATT: I mean...
SAM: Visibly stoned?

1194
00:44:03.305 --> 00:44:04.648
MATT: You don't see anything yet.

1195
00:44:04.648 --> 00:44:07.043
It's more it's just starting-- she's starting to feel

1196
00:44:07.043 --> 00:44:08.805
the physicality changing.
TRAVIS: [inaudible]

1197
00:44:08.805 --> 00:44:10.580
(laughter)

1198
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.022
MARISHA: Do you hear sirens?
TRAVIS: These sunglasses.

1199
00:44:12.022 --> 00:44:13.230
MARISHA: No, okay, no, no, that's fine.

1200
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:14.740
MATT: Damage on the first one?
MARISHA: 18.

1201
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.233
MATT: 18, nice.

1202
00:44:16.233 --> 00:44:17.066
MARISHA: That's good, too.

1203
00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.362
13.
MATT: 13.

1204
00:44:21.362 --> 00:44:23.020
MARISHA: Damage on the second.
MATT: Great.

1205
00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.031
Yasha, you take nine points of poison damage.

1206
00:44:25.031 --> 00:44:27.520
MARISHA: Fuck, sorry.
MATT: And five points of poison damage.

1207
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.450
MARISHA: Sorry.
MATT: So 14 total.

1208
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.002
MARISHA: Are you okay?
MATT: As you're like (impacts).

1209
00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:33.402
TALIESIN: She just dropped under 100.

1210
00:44:33.402 --> 00:44:36.088
LAURA: Don't tell her secrets!

1211
00:44:36.088 --> 00:44:37.209
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

1212
00:44:37.209 --> 00:44:38.970
MATT: Go for it.
TALIESIN: I mean, she's looking fine. Sorry.

1213
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.904
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I'm okay.
MARISHA: If she looks fine, then Flurry of Blows.

1214
00:44:40.904 --> 00:44:42.246
MATT: A single roll for each of these.
TALIESIN: I have no brain right now.

1215
00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.440
MARISHA: Pop pop.

1216
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.540
Still with the d4s, come on.

1217
00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:51.950
Okay, d4 for the seven. Uh-huh!

1218
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.880
21 again, and for this one, I don't think

1219
00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.430
it makes it. 19?
MATT: 19 misses.

1220
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:59.670
The third one does hit.

1221
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.480
MARISHA: But, okay.

1222
00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.980
10 damage and--
MATT: Yasha, you you take...

1223
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:07.626
12 points of poison damage.

1224
00:45:07.626 --> 00:45:09.567
TRAVIS: Oof, rolling a d12.

1225
00:45:09.567 --> 00:45:11.470
MARISHA: And Extract Aspects.
MATT: Indeed.

1226
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:12.800
As you pummel it,

1227
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.576
your one hand going into a blade-type strike,

1228
00:45:16.576 --> 00:45:18.460
slips in its body and your ki connects

1229
00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:21.674
with its body's life force and that moment you realize

1230
00:45:21.674 --> 00:45:25.150
as part of its physical interior, it is immune to poison,

1231
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.940
but it also cannot be frightened,

1232
00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.520
cannot be petrified and cannot be stunned.

1233
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.323
It is a wall of angry mutated beast.

1234
00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:37.679
SAM: You didn't say charmed, though, right?

1235
00:45:37.679 --> 00:45:38.527
MATT: No.

1236
00:45:38.527 --> 00:45:39.633
SAM: It can be charmed.

1237
00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:43.108
MARISHA: Okay, I just yell out:

1238
00:45:43.108 --> 00:45:46.160
Can't stun this one, which really fucking blows.

1239
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.317
MATT: Make constitution saving throw for me.

1240
00:45:47.317 --> 00:45:48.550
MARISHA: Ugh!

1241
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:49.740
TALIESIN: With a d4.
MATT: With advantage

1242
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.122
and a d4.

1243
00:45:51.122 --> 00:45:53.270
Because everything stacks, everything stacks.

1244
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:56.063
Seven players: everything stacks.

1245
00:45:56.063 --> 00:45:57.370
MARISHA: Constitution, you said?
MATT: Yeah.

1246
00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.410
MARISHA: That's good.

1247
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.000
18 plus three, 21.

1248
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.055
MATT: 21. Yeah, you resist the effect.

1249
00:46:03.055 --> 00:46:04.273
LAURA: ♪ Shake it off! ♪
ASHLEY: Yes!

1250
00:46:04.273 --> 00:46:05.587
MARISHA: I shake it off completely?

1251
00:46:05.587 --> 00:46:06.743
TRAVIS: ♪ Ooh ooh! ♪
LAURA: It's gone?

1252
00:46:06.743 --> 00:46:07.623
TRAVIS: You're not restrained.

1253
00:46:07.623 --> 00:46:08.457
LIAM: You're not stone.

1254
00:46:08.457 --> 00:46:09.290
SAM: Oh wow!
LAURA: Oh shit!

1255
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:11.617
LIAM: You didn't turn into statue.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

1256
00:46:11.617 --> 00:46:13.290
MATT: So you manage to-- your physicality (grunts)

1257
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:14.540
shrugs off the effect.

1258
00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.373
SAM: Wow.
TALIESIN: Damn.

1259
00:46:15.373 --> 00:46:16.464
TRAVIS: The gray goes away?

1260
00:46:16.464 --> 00:46:18.140
MATT: The gray begins to fade, you shake off

1261
00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.900
the elements of, like, crackled dirt

1262
00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.250
and stone that began to gather. You're fine.

1263
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:26.750
LIAM and TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1264
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.636
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: ♪ Kay, kay, kay, kay-kay, kay. ♪

1265
00:46:28.636 --> 00:46:30.847
MARISHA: That's my turn.
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: ♪ Kay, kay, kay, kay-kay. ♪

1266
00:46:30.847 --> 00:46:32.710
(laughter)

1267
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:35.535
MARISHA: Was that the Nickelodeon theme?
LAURA: Yeah.

1268
00:46:35.535 --> 00:46:38.332
ASHLEY: Well, because he did it,
and I was like: that sounds like Nickelodeon.

1269
00:46:38.332 --> 00:46:39.904
This is nerves.

1270
00:46:39.904 --> 00:46:41.678
That's happening today.
TALIESIN: So many nerves.

1271
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.003
MATT: All right, end of your turn,

1272
00:46:44.003 --> 00:46:45.870
it's going to go ahead and use

1273
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.833
one legendary action.
SAM: Uh-oh.

1274
00:46:47.833 --> 00:46:49.808
LAURA: No. Don't.
MATT: To--

1275
00:46:49.808 --> 00:46:50.791
TRAVIS: Vertical takeoff.

1276
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:53.200
MATT: Go ahead and Defensive Shift.

1277
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.280
LAURA: No!

1278
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.331
MATT: Five, 10, 15.

1279
00:46:56.331 --> 00:46:57.957
ASHLEY: Do we get to-- wait, we don't get to.
MARISHA: Can do the thing?

1280
00:46:57.957 --> 00:46:58.790
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MATT: No.

1281
00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.950
ASHLEY: -- since he did the thing?
MARISHA: Oh right, we can't.

1282
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.350
MATT: Yeah, there's no opportunity attacks. He like

1283
00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:05.190
barrels through and you try and go to swing

1284
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:06.860
and it just managed to push out

1285
00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.780
before you even got a chance to swing at it.

1286
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.470
All righty, that finishes...

1287
00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:14.380
Beauregard's turn. Nott, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

1288
00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.280
SAM: Okay.

1289
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.862
While levitating, I will get into the prone position

1290
00:47:19.862 --> 00:47:21.290
(laughter)

1291
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.901
to steady my shot.

1292
00:47:22.901 --> 00:47:24.398
MATT: Okay.

1293
00:47:24.398 --> 00:47:25.499
TALIESIN: I love all of this.

1294
00:47:25.499 --> 00:47:27.211
LIAM: Feet just going--

1295
00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:28.636
MATT: Air swimming.
SAM: Yeah.

1296
00:47:28.636 --> 00:47:30.852
And I will fire at the bull.

1297
00:47:30.852 --> 00:47:32.818
MATT: Go for it.
TALIESIN: With a d4.

1298
00:47:32.818 --> 00:47:35.910
SAM: With the d4.
ASHLEY: And you have advantage.

1299
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:40.213
SAM: And I have advantage, yeah!

1300
00:47:40.213 --> 00:47:42.070
26.
MATT: That hits.

1301
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.410
Go ahead and roll damage.

1302
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.520
SAM: Oh shit, it's not next to anything.

1303
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.523
MATT: Nope, no sneak attack.
SAM: Think I can hide up here?

1304
00:47:48.523 --> 00:47:50.865
MATT: Nah. I'm going to say probably not.

1305
00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:53.023
SAM: Shit, all right, so--

1306
00:47:53.023 --> 00:47:54.220
LAURA: You had advantage, does that--

1307
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.768
that doesn't matter.

1308
00:47:57.279 --> 00:47:58.593
SAM: Hmm.

1309
00:47:58.593 --> 00:47:59.826
MATT: He wouldn't have had advantage on that.

1310
00:47:59.826 --> 00:48:00.740
SAM: Why did I have advantage?

1311
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.590
ASHLEY: Because of battle cry.

1312
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.600
MATT: Oh!

1313
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.890
If you had advantage on the attack,

1314
00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:06.270
I believe it would allow a sneak attack.

1315
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.271
SAM: I think it does.
MATT: Pretty sure it does, then.

1316
00:48:09.271 --> 00:48:11.610
TALIESIN: Battle cry. Good to remember.
MARISHA: I even have that in my notes!

1317
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:13.557
ASHLEY: Guys, I remembered something!

1318
00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:15.120
(cheering)

1319
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.360
TALIESIN: Welcome back.

1320
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.280
ASHLEY: I'm starting to learn how to play D&amp;D!
MATT: Yeah, no, you got it, you got it.

1321
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.110
Yeah, whenever you have an attack that has advantage,

1322
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:22.741
that's one of the criteria for getting sneak attack.

1323
00:48:22.741 --> 00:48:26.260
SAM: Wow, that's fucking great. Thank you, Ashley and Laura.

1324
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.970
Oh man, that's so much better.
LAURA: Ooh!

1325
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:30.430
That's really good.
SAM: Okay.

1326
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:35.430
10, 20, 30.
TALIESIN: Oh, wow!

1327
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:39.178
SAM: Plus six. 36.

1328
00:48:39.178 --> 00:48:42.370
I'll do Fury of the Small, making it 47.

1329
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:43.997
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: 47 points of damage.

1330
00:48:43.997 --> 00:48:45.620
SAM: Points of damage.
MARISHA: Wow.

1331
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.630
MATT: The bolt sinks into the top of its head

1332
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:49.920
and it like, (grunting)

1333
00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:54.300
It's angry, it's real pissed.
LAURA: Oh my god.

1334
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.460
SAM: Seeing that it's angry,

1335
00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.760
I'll float down five feet closer to it.

1336
00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.593
MATT: Okay.

1337
00:48:59.593 --> 00:49:03.120
SAM: And fire again.
MATT: Okay.

1338
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.010
Float down.
SAM: I don't have advantage

1339
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.950
on this.
LAURA: Yeah, you do. All attacks.

1340
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:08.530
TALIESIN: This round have advantage.

1341
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:12.100
SAM: I'll see if I get-- no.

1342
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.470
Okay, so it's more. It's like 29 to hit.

1343
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:17.545
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: I don't get sneak attack twice.

1344
00:49:17.545 --> 00:49:20.031
MATT: No. You only get it once per turn.

1345
00:49:20.031 --> 00:49:23.600
SAM: Oh, this is only eight more points of damage.

1346
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.670
MATT: All righty.
SAM: And then

1347
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:29.129
I will float back up 15 feet higher.

1348
00:49:29.129 --> 00:49:30.260
MATT: (laughs)

1349
00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.140
All right, we'll put you at--

1350
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.799
This is about 30 feet.
MARISHA: It's like a platformer.

1351
00:49:33.799 --> 00:49:34.632
SAM: Yep.

1352
00:49:36.327 --> 00:49:38.630
MATT: There you go.
SAM: Bye bye.

1353
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:40.320
MATT: All right. Finishing Nott's turn, brings us to Caleb.

1354
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.410
Fjord, you're on deck.
LIAM: Okay.

1355
00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:43.860
Caleb is not even moving, going math brain and seeing

1356
00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.740
where Caduceus' family are, sees where Beauregard is--

1357
00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.750
MATT: Actually, at the end of Nott's turn,
it's going to go ahead and use--

1358
00:49:50.184 --> 00:49:51.017
MARISHA: Calm your shit.

1359
00:49:51.017 --> 00:49:53.440
(laughter)

1360
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.990
MATT: It's going to use a legendary action

1361
00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.530
to go ahead and Defensive Shift.
LAURA: Fuck your math.

1362
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.230
MARISHA: We don't care about family here.

1363
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:03.570
MATT: 15.
LAURA: All of it.

1364
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:04.403
MATT: 20.

1365
00:50:04.403 --> 00:50:07.730
LAURA: He runs into that statue?! No!

1366
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:10.298
MARISHA: Wait, what? Wait, did he take out a statue?

1367
00:50:10.298 --> 00:50:11.581
SAM: He did.

1368
00:50:11.581 --> 00:50:12.629
LAURA: What statue was it?

1369
00:50:12.629 --> 00:50:14.760
SAM: Matthew's got statue bits.
LAURA: Statue crumbles?!

1370
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.407
SAM: Statue bits, oh no!

1371
00:50:16.407 --> 00:50:18.328
TALIESIN: Not cool, dude.
MATT: Bits and pieces.

1372
00:50:18.328 --> 00:50:19.845
LAURA: Oh no!
ASHLEY: <i>Matthew</i>!

1373
00:50:19.845 --> 00:50:23.417
MATT: As that statue just explodes

1374
00:50:23.417 --> 00:50:25.580
and pieces and chunks of it land on the battlefield.

1375
00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.355
LAURA: Sick bastard!

1376
00:50:27.355 --> 00:50:29.633
SAM: What a monster!

1377
00:50:29.633 --> 00:50:31.027
TRAVIS: Was that your--

1378
00:50:31.027 --> 00:50:31.860
MATT: You don't know yet.

1379
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.560
TALIESIN: I didn't see.

1380
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.065
LAURA: Was that your family?

1381
00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:36.710
TRAVIS: Oh, Caduceus!

1382
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.100
MARISHA: Wait, was that who were looking at?

1383
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.080
TALIESIN: No, no. There are two over there,

1384
00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.693
but I don't know who that was.

1385
00:50:41.693 --> 00:50:42.747
MATT: Caleb, it's your turn.

1386
00:50:42.747 --> 00:50:44.480
LIAM: Okay, changes things slightly then.

1387
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.420
So he had an idea,

1388
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.650
but he's got to alter it. Five, 10, 15, 20,

1389
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:52.675
25, 30, he runs over here.

1390
00:50:52.675 --> 00:50:53.608
MATT: 25, 30.

1391
00:50:53.608 --> 00:50:55.080
Unfortunately, now you're getting enough

1392
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.650
into the water there where
it's starting to lower your speed.

1393
00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.766
So that's as far as you can move there.
LIAM: Okay.

1394
00:51:02.258 --> 00:51:03.865
All right.

1395
00:51:03.865 --> 00:51:04.953
TALIESIN: Can go around the other way and then--

1396
00:51:04.953 --> 00:51:07.861
LIAM: Hmm.
SAM: Did you just Baywatch run over there?

1397
00:51:07.861 --> 00:51:08.936
MATT: (slow footsteps)

1398
00:51:08.936 --> 00:51:11.580
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was imagining.

1399
00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.125
SAM: Except a filthy hobo.

1400
00:51:13.125 --> 00:51:15.800
LAURA: No, he's got his purple coat on, he's not filthy.

1401
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.117
MATT: He washed a long time ago, Nott.

1402
00:51:17.117 --> 00:51:18.882
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: He gets dirty a lot.

1403
00:51:18.882 --> 00:51:20.366
LIAM: Shit.

1404
00:51:20.366 --> 00:51:21.990
MATT: You all do, to be fair.

1405
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.823
LIAM: Shit.

1406
00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:25.180
Okay, I'm going to do it anyway.

1407
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.210
Pulls out the cat's cradle and just slams it.

1408
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.010
Is it water where I'm standing?

1409
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:36.010
MATT: You are in water, yes--
LIAM: Balls, Ted. Can't do that, then.

1410
00:51:36.759 --> 00:51:37.930
I thought I would make it farther.

1411
00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:40.720
So instead, I got to do something completely different.

1412
00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.820
I'm going to cast, shit, I'm going to cast Slow again.

1413
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.090
MATT: Okay, that's a--
LIAM: That's wisdom.

1414
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:47.923
MATT: Wisdom.

1415
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.540
Oh, 19, plus one, 20.

1416
00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.193
LIAM: Saves. Okay.
MATT: All right, sorry.

1417
00:51:53.193 --> 00:51:54.540
SAM: Goddamn it.

1418
00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.890
LIAM: That move changed everything.

1419
00:51:57.339 --> 00:51:59.769
MATT: Good. (laughs)

1420
00:51:59.769 --> 00:52:00.602
All right. That finishes your turn?

1421
00:52:00.602 --> 00:52:01.940
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: All righty.

1422
00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.330
That brings us to Fjord.

1423
00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:06.720
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to--
LAURA: You get advantage.

1424
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.662
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. I'm going to run
30 feet back on this diagonal.

1425
00:52:10.662 --> 00:52:12.225
SAM: Oh boy.
MATT: Okay.

1426
00:52:12.225 --> 00:52:13.378
SAM: If he attacks you.

1427
00:52:13.378 --> 00:52:15.428
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30. That gets you right there.

1428
00:52:15.428 --> 00:52:16.987
You run past those two statues there.

1429
00:52:16.987 --> 00:52:18.287
It does get an attack of opportunity on you.

1430
00:52:18.287 --> 00:52:19.795
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

1431
00:52:19.795 --> 00:52:20.951
MATT: That's natural 20.

1432
00:52:20.951 --> 00:52:21.959
SAM and LAURA: Oh!

1433
00:52:21.959 --> 00:52:24.200
TRAVIS: That went as poorly as it could've.
TALIESIN: How close am I?

1434
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.850
MATT: You are--
LAURA: Close.

1435
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:28.340
MATT: 35 feet away from it.

1436
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:31.097
TALIESIN: I'm 35 feet away from Fjord?
MATT: Yeah.

1437
00:52:31.097 --> 00:52:33.570
Yeah, because, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.

1438
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:37.010
TALIESIN: Motherfucker, okay, never mind.

1439
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:38.040
MATT: So--
TALIESIN: Sorry.

1440
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.184
TRAVIS: That was a gamble and it didn't pay off.

1441
00:52:40.184 --> 00:52:41.740
SAM: Nope.
MATT: Sometimes it does.

1442
00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.773
Not today.

1443
00:52:43.773 --> 00:52:44.606
TRAVIS: "Not today."

1444
00:52:44.606 --> 00:52:46.802
LAURA: What if you'd stayed in the corner?

1445
00:52:46.802 --> 00:52:48.293
MARISHA: Not today.

1446
00:52:48.293 --> 00:52:50.200
SAM: This is an <i>udder</i> disaster.

1447
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.011
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: Oh!

1448
00:52:53.094 --> 00:52:55.197
Milked that one.
SAM: "Milked that one"?

1449
00:52:55.197 --> 00:52:57.310
MATT: 54 points of piercing damage.

1450
00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:58.640
TRAVIS: Oh, that sounds good.

1451
00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.980
LAURA: How much?!
TRAVIS: 54.

1452
00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.240
MATT: You go to run away and it just gores you in the back

1453
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.120
with its horn. You see Fjord get impaled on it.

1454
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.470
It swings its head side to side shaking him

1455
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:10.470
before he gets thrown off of it.

1456
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:12.370
He rolls across the edge,

1457
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:14.200
barely getting back to his feet and you can feel

1458
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.124
the puncture wound in your back bleeding profusely.

1459
00:53:17.124 --> 00:53:18.610
LIAM: Should've steered clear.

1460
00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:19.850
(groaning)

1461
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:22.006
TRAVIS: Oh, wow! This is really--

1462
00:53:24.189 --> 00:53:26.251
MATT: Oh, that hurts.

1463
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:27.868
Hurts right here.
TALIESIN: That was good.

1464
00:53:27.868 --> 00:53:31.690
TRAVIS: All right. That sucked.

1465
00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:33.810
I'm going to send all three Eldritch Blasts

1466
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.100
towards it with advantage.

1467
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:35.933
MATT: Go for it.

1468
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.640
TRAVIS: That's a 21 to hit?
MATT: That hits.

1469
00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.050
TRAVIS: Okay, second one is a...

1470
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:44.738
25.
MATT: That hits.

1471
00:53:44.738 --> 00:53:48.104
TRAVIS: Third one is a 20.

1472
00:53:48.104 --> 00:53:49.529
MATT: That hits. All three hit.

1473
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:55.280
TRAVIS: 11 points of force damage.

1474
00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.350
That is seven points of force damage.

1475
00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:03.640
18 and 12, so--
MATT: Nice.

1476
00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.470
TRAVIS: 30.
MATT: 30 points of force damage.

1477
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.179
After getting up, you turn around. (groaning)

1478
00:54:07.179 --> 00:54:08.492
TRAVIS: (gun firing)

1479
00:54:08.492 --> 00:54:10.480
MATT: Just fan the hammer up towards it.

1480
00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.957
TRAVIS: Fan the hammer! Pow, pow, pow!

1481
00:54:11.957 --> 00:54:13.960
MATT: Yeah, you can see between all the hits it's taking,

1482
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.230
it's starting to show wear and tear, like, it's hurt

1483
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.090
and it's not, like, limping, but you guys

1484
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.390
have done a fair amount of damage to it

1485
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:22.422
and it's starting to really show.

1486
00:54:22.422 --> 00:54:23.550
SAM: This is good.

1487
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.240
MATT: That finishes Fjord's turn.

1488
00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.850
Jester you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

1489
00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:29.300
LAURA: All right, for my bonus action

1490
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.602
I'm going to have my duplicate run forward,

1491
00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:36.788
take a flying leap into the air, do a double flip

1492
00:54:36.788 --> 00:54:39.800
and land on its back.
SAM: Woo!

1493
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.671
LAURA: Like with one hand holding a horn

1494
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:43.383
and the other hand going--
SAM: Yeah!

1495
00:54:43.383 --> 00:54:44.783
MATT: You got it.

1496
00:54:44.783 --> 00:54:48.712
TRAVIS: 30 points of radiant damage to the bull. [inaudible]

1497
00:54:48.712 --> 00:54:51.403
MATT: Okay. There you go.
LAURA: And the duplicate Jester--

1498
00:54:51.403 --> 00:54:53.452
MARISHA: Does Fjord flex off of your--
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1499
00:54:53.452 --> 00:54:57.693
LAURA: -- is going to try to
cast Inflict Wounds at 5th-level.

1500
00:54:57.693 --> 00:54:59.737
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

1501
00:55:03.577 --> 00:55:05.243
LAURA: Woof.

1502
00:55:05.243 --> 00:55:07.270
Thank god it was at advantage.

1503
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:08.750
23.
MATT: 23 hits.

1504
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:09.583
ASHLEY: Yes.

1505
00:55:09.583 --> 00:55:11.320
SAM: Yeah, it's not--

1506
00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.340
LAURA: Moo. Okay, so that is, how many?

1507
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.540
7d10.

1508
00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.982
MATT: Goddamn, you guys!

1509
00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:20.575
ASHLEY: Dang!

1510
00:55:20.575 --> 00:55:23.555
SAM: Wait, did you say 7d10?
MATT and LAURA: 7d10.

1511
00:55:23.555 --> 00:55:26.883
MATT: 5th-level Inflict Wounds.
LIAM and LAURA: (mooing)

1512
00:55:26.883 --> 00:55:29.160
I'm just going to use the percentile.
ASHLEY: What a good moo-ve.

1513
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.582
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1514
00:55:30.582 --> 00:55:34.091
MATT: There it is.
SAM: That was the one.

1515
00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:37.141
LAURA: How many is that?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1516
00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:41.400
TRAVIS: I'm bovine proud of you?
LAURA: Nope.

1517
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.590
TRAVIS: I'm gon' workshop it.

1518
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:45.490
SAM: No, how about "I'm dairy proud of you"?

1519
00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:46.690
MARISHA: Oh!

1520
00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:48.118
TRAVIS: Show me up, why don't you.

1521
00:55:48.118 --> 00:55:51.035
(laughter)

1522
00:55:52.091 --> 00:55:54.241
LAURA: 19, 21,

1523
00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:57.056
26.
TRAVIS: That attack was heifer-bull?

1524
00:55:57.056 --> 00:55:59.481
Nope. Okay. I'll come back. I'll get there.

1525
00:55:59.481 --> 00:56:00.440
TALIESIN: Yeah...

1526
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.285
LAURA: That was kind of shitty. 28 points.

1527
00:56:02.285 --> 00:56:03.880
MATT: 28 points necrotic damage to it,

1528
00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.880
as the illusory Jester strikes down and you watch

1529
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.155
as a brief burst of black necrotic energy

1530
00:56:11.155 --> 00:56:13.000
swirls around digs into its body.

1531
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.320
Suddenly, you see these black smearing tendrils

1532
00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.160
of terrible, tearing arcane energy begin

1533
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.733
to pull through its body.

1534
00:56:19.733 --> 00:56:21.540
(groaning)

1535
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.373
It's angry.

1536
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:25.050
This finishes your turn?

1537
00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:28.170
LAURA: It does.
MATT: It's going to use its last action.

1538
00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:30.250
Legendary action to move forward.

1539
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:31.420
Which this is your illusion.

1540
00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.846
LAURA: Yeah, she just stays there like, "Oh no!"

1541
00:56:33.846 --> 00:56:36.280
MATT: Yeah, falls off a bit.

1542
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.602
LAURA: But she's just floating in the air.

1543
00:56:38.602 --> 00:56:39.435
SAM: Near me.
MATT: 15.

1544
00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:42.475
SAM: No, another statue!

1545
00:56:42.475 --> 00:56:44.939
LAURA: No!

1546
00:56:44.939 --> 00:56:45.939
SAM: Aunt Janice!

1547
00:56:46.914 --> 00:56:48.570
LAURA: What if you knew that one?

1548
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:50.370
TALIESIN: That's entirely possible.

1549
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:53.340
SAM: We'll never know.
TALIESIN: I watched you run

1550
00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.580
and was like: Well, oh no.

1551
00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.600
MARISHA: Maybe we can still find their face

1552
00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.451
like Ariel with Prince Eric.
TALIESIN: It doesn't work that--

1553
00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:02.200
SAM: Sure, yeah. Yeah.

1554
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.644
LAURA: Oh, Eric--
LIAM: And then bring them back to horrific life.

1555
00:57:04.644 --> 00:57:06.884
(laughter)
(screaming)

1556
00:57:06.884 --> 00:57:07.931
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

1557
00:57:07.931 --> 00:57:11.193
LAURA: Why?!
SAM: Why am I just a face?

1558
00:57:12.151 --> 00:57:14.300
TALIESIN: Am I within 30 feet of that?

1559
00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.617
MATT: You are. It's just within 30 feet of you now.

1560
00:57:17.617 --> 00:57:19.516
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the same thing I did last time.

1561
00:57:19.516 --> 00:57:21.658
I'm going to--
MATT: Channel Divinity again?

1562
00:57:21.658 --> 00:57:22.633
TALIESIN: Channel Divinity
again and then

1563
00:57:22.633 --> 00:57:26.833
I'm going to pull back behind the tree.

1564
00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:28.962
MATT: Over here?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1565
00:57:28.962 --> 00:57:30.810
MATT: All righty. There you go.

1566
00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:32.109
Finishes Caduceus' turn?

1567
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:34.255
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

1568
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:40.303
At the end of your turn, it's going to back a bit.

1569
00:57:44.474 --> 00:57:45.317
(galloping)

1570
00:57:45.317 --> 00:57:47.374
LAURA: Oh no!

1571
00:57:48.284 --> 00:57:50.210
MATT: It moves forward, it smashes the one statue.

1572
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:51.517
It looks at you.

1573
00:57:51.517 --> 00:57:54.180
TRAVIS: (shouting)

1574
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.495
MATT: It's going to rush towards you.

1575
00:57:55.495 --> 00:57:56.811
MARISHA: ♪ Moo-ve, bitch! ♪

1576
00:57:56.811 --> 00:57:58.580
MARISHA and TRAVIS: ♪ Get out the way! ♪

1577
00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:00.930
MATT: That's 21 to hit.
TRAVIS: That hits.

1578
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:04.170
MATT: All right. I need you to make a strength saving throw.

1579
00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:07.859
TRAVIS: Okay. Not with advantage, right? I don't think so.

1580
00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:11.040
TALIESIN: Yeah. Still with advantage because of battle cry.

1581
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.565
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Because I haven't gone yet.

1582
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:15.400
TRAVIS: (sighs)

1583
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.360
Seven.
MATT: You are knocked prone.

1584
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.878
TRAVIS: Four and a five.
LAURA and SAM: Oh no.

1585
00:58:21.878 --> 00:58:25.290
MATT: That is 28 points of piercing damage.

1586
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:28.757
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool. Here, let me roll a d8.

1587
00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:31.190
It takes-- Hey! Oh.

1588
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:32.680
Six points of radiant damage.
MATT: Six points of radiant damage.

1589
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.190
As a bonus action, it's going to go ahead and now rear up

1590
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:37.517
onto its hind legs.

1591
00:58:37.517 --> 00:58:38.470
TRAVIS: Take 24 points for that?

1592
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:40.910
MATT: Yeah, and come down with its hooves on top of you

1593
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:43.315
because you are prone, it has advantage on that attack.

1594
00:58:43.315 --> 00:58:44.600
SAM: 28.

1595
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.390
MATT: Natural 20, at advantage.

1596
00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:49.781
TRAVIS: This is going to suck a lot.
TALIESIN: Nope, nope.

1597
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:51.170
Can't do anything about that.

1598
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:53.620
MATT: So on the hoof action.

1599
00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.411
SAM: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: Okay, that's okay.

1600
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:58.150
MATT: Okay, that is...

1601
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:02.960
34 points of bludgeoning damage.

1602
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.780
As its hooves come down and slam into your chest.

1603
00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.960
You guys see water and wet red earth

1604
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.530
splatter out as it puts the force of its body down

1605
00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:13.050
onto Fjord's chest.

1606
00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:14.691
TRAVIS: So it knocked me unconscious,

1607
00:59:14.691 --> 00:59:17.099
but my Relentless Endurance will--

1608
00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:18.165
MATT: So you're back to one hit point.

1609
00:59:18.165 --> 00:59:20.740
TRAVIS: Shoot me up to one hit point.
MATT: That's true.

1610
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.410
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: That's true, okay.

1611
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:25.220
Oh, and I also get to see if it gets its--

1612
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.121
Ooh yeah! It gets its a petrifying breath back, okay.

1613
00:59:28.121 --> 00:59:29.580
LAURA: Fuck!

1614
00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.180
MATT: All righty, that ends its turn.

1615
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.281
Yasha, you're up. Beau, you're on deck.

1616
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:36.420
ASHLEY: (groans) So far away from him.

1617
00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:38.320
All right, I'll just take my whole turn.

1618
00:59:39.321 --> 00:59:42.311
Dash and get behind.
TRAVIS: Let me roll one more.

1619
00:59:42.311 --> 00:59:45.678
It takes a whopping six points of
radiant damage for that last stuff.

1620
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.840
MATT: 30 right there, you mean?
ASHLEY: Oh, I guess. I get there?

1621
00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.190
MATT: You do, but it takes your full action to get there.

1622
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:52.280
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.
MARISHA: Was that 30?

1623
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.113
Wait, how many?

1624
00:59:53.113 --> 00:59:55.039
TRAVIS: Six more points radiant damage.
MATT: You got it.

1625
00:59:55.039 --> 00:59:56.790
TRAVIS: Even though it doesn't matter.

1626
00:59:56.790 --> 01:00:00.000
MATT: No, it all adds up, man. It's hurt.

1627
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.200
ASHLEY: Yeah, you can go more.

1628
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.610
Yep, that's my turn.
SAM: Oh no.

1629
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.510
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: It's all I can do.

1630
01:00:09.185 --> 01:00:11.077
SAM: You need some throwing stars.

1631
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:16.450
ASHLEY: Actually, can I go a little further to Fjord or no?

1632
01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.283
MATT: You'd be able to...

1633
01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.533
Let's see, you were right over here.

1634
01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.320
35, 40. You can't get quite to Fjord.

1635
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.230
ASHLEY: So I can't touch him?
MATT: Not yet, no.

1636
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:30.067
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: And even then

1637
01:00:30.067 --> 01:00:31.575
it would take an action to do your thing.

1638
01:00:31.575 --> 01:00:33.023
ASHLEY: Yeah, oh, yeah, what am I thinking?

1639
01:00:33.023 --> 01:00:34.460
Okay, yeah, yeah.
MATT: Okay.

1640
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.710
Beauregard, you're up. Nott, you're on deck.

1641
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:39.601
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to run

1642
01:00:39.601 --> 01:00:41.720
and I'm going to Step of the Wind.

1643
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.050
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: As my bonus to dash.

1644
01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:47.920
LAURA: I'm going to 'Tep of the Win'.

1645
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.368
MARISHA: Da twees in da win!

1646
01:00:50.368 --> 01:00:52.178
SAM: Tee in the win.

1647
01:00:52.178 --> 01:00:54.706
MATT: [Inaudible] All right. Where are you going?

1648
01:00:54.706 --> 01:00:57.082
MARISHA: I will--

1649
01:00:57.082 --> 01:00:58.559
Well, I--

1650
01:00:58.559 --> 01:01:01.173
MATT: Wow. The whole table just quoted Nell.

1651
01:01:01.173 --> 01:01:02.995
In, like, a wave.

1652
01:01:02.995 --> 01:01:03.832
ASHLEY: That was really amazing.

1653
01:01:03.832 --> 01:01:04.806
MATT: Wow!

1654
01:01:04.806 --> 01:01:06.355
Okay, you can pretty much go anywhere you want to

1655
01:01:06.355 --> 01:01:07.630
with Step of the Wind.
MARISHA: Right, because I have 100 feet.

1656
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:10.480
Am I able to flank Yasha?

1657
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.300
MATT: Unfortunately, that's where Fjord is.
MARISHA: I can't, like, straddle

1658
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.740
Fjord and, like, fight over his legs?

1659
01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.517
TRAVIS: Oh god, oh! Just kill me.

1660
01:01:20.517 --> 01:01:22.108
(laughter)

1661
01:01:22.108 --> 01:01:23.500
MARISHA: You know, I'll stand on his chest.

1662
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.461
I don't care. Can I do that?

1663
01:01:25.461 --> 01:01:27.322
MATT: I will say no, because he's occupying the space.

1664
01:01:27.322 --> 01:01:30.193
TRAVIS: My face is in the surf. Are you fucking crazy?

1665
01:01:30.193 --> 01:01:32.818
MARISHA: Hmm.
TRAVIS: (frantic gurgling)

1666
01:01:32.818 --> 01:01:35.051
MARISHA: You'll be fine!

1667
01:01:35.051 --> 01:01:36.560
Turn over!
TALIESIN: Oh, you can breathe

1668
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.980
it anyway.
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true!

1669
01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.990
LAURA: Oh. You're fine!
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to...

1670
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:43.590
After seeing Jester's duplicate get flown off

1671
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:46.570
I'm going to flip forward and
I'm going to jump on top of him.

1672
01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.040
I'm going to have a Saddle Ranch moment.

1673
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.380
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: And I'm going to

1674
01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.587
just start, like, right behind.

1675
01:01:53.587 --> 01:01:55.572
MATT: Make an athletics check.

1676
01:01:55.572 --> 01:01:57.154
MARISHA: An athle-- not an acroba--

1677
01:01:57.154 --> 01:01:58.800
MATT: To see if you can hold on to it

1678
01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.300
as you leap onto its back.
MARISHA: Do I have, like, advantage

1679
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.600
or anything, no?

1680
01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.323
Natural 20.

1681
01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:06.600
(cheering)
MATT: Yes, you do.

1682
01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.080
You run, leap in the air, vaulting

1683
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.930
off the back of its hindquarters,

1684
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:14.472
land onto it, grab on.

1685
01:02:14.472 --> 01:02:16.700
There's two of these large spines that stick out of the back

1686
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.740
of its armor, and you just grab one

1687
01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.740
and you're holding this. It's trying to buck you off.

1688
01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:25.463
LAURA: I use my reaction to write 10 on a piece of paper.

1689
01:02:25.463 --> 01:02:26.703
And hold it up on the rocks.

1690
01:02:26.703 --> 01:02:28.094
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: 10 seconds!

1691
01:02:28.094 --> 01:02:30.330
MARISHA: It's a good night at the ranch, you guys.

1692
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:34.110
I've had, like, one daiquiri, but not enough to, like,

1693
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:36.443
just enough to feel it, and then I--
TRAVIS: Saddle Ranch doesn't normally [inaudible].

1694
01:02:36.443 --> 01:02:38.051
MARISHA: -- no, it does not--

1695
01:02:38.051 --> 01:02:41.370
and I'm just going to go for, like, right at that plate

1696
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:43.530
behind his neck.
MATT: Go for it.

1697
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:45.504
MARISHA: Do I have...?

1698
01:02:45.504 --> 01:02:47.110
MATT: You don't have advantage, no, just a single attack.

1699
01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:48.560
MARISHA: Okay, do I have a Bless still?

1700
01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.230
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Okay.

1701
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:53.388
So for this 14--
TALIESIN: But you hit the--

1702
01:02:53.388 --> 01:02:55.000
You got the natural 20, right? Or--

1703
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.123
MARISHA: That was to hold on.

1704
01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.328
26.
MATT: To hit?

1705
01:03:02.328 --> 01:03:05.169
MARISHA: Yeah. And 28.

1706
01:03:05.169 --> 01:03:06.002
MATT: Yeah, 28 to hit.

1707
01:03:06.002 --> 01:03:06.835
All right, cool.

1708
01:03:06.835 --> 01:03:07.668
The first hit is how much damage?

1709
01:03:07.668 --> 01:03:09.688
MARISHA: Oh, is this going to be bad?
TRAVIS: Yeah, it'll kill me.

1710
01:03:09.688 --> 01:03:10.540
LAURA: It's fine, it's fine.

1711
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.300
MATT: The first hit is... how much damage

1712
01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.240
It's doubled because Caduceus used that ability on the last.

1713
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.659
MARISHA: Damage is doubled?
MATT: Yeah.

1714
01:03:18.659 --> 01:03:23.370
TRAVIS: (lip popping)

1715
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:24.670
MARISHA: Good night at the Ranch.

1716
01:03:25.757 --> 01:03:26.710
TRAVIS: That's what happens in Yosemite.

1717
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:28.240
MARISHA: At 11, it's a bad night at the Ranch.

1718
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.330
MATT: 22 points of damage.

1719
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:33.464
All right, Fjord, you take eight poison points of damage.

1720
01:03:33.464 --> 01:03:35.090
TRAVIS: (dying grunts)

1721
01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:36.224
MATT: Roll damage for the next attack.

1722
01:03:36.224 --> 01:03:37.817
LAURA: K.O.

1723
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:45.771
MARISHA: I think that is a two.

1724
01:03:45.771 --> 01:03:49.354
That's eight points of damage.

1725
01:03:49.354 --> 01:03:50.750
MATT: Eight points of damage.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1726
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.750
MATT: Fjord, you take 12 points of poison damage.

1727
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:54.000
That's one failed death saving throw.

1728
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.930
TRAVIS: I think it's two because I'm unconscious.

1729
01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:58.630
MATT: Well, no, it's a critical attack

1730
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:59.960
that gives you two death saves.

1731
01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.690
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: So it's just the one.

1732
01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:04.399
You have your bonus action.
TRAVIS: Good times.

1733
01:04:04.399 --> 01:04:07.200
MARISHA: Realizing that my friend is unconscious

1734
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.620
and drowning--
MATT: Yasha, you also took 12 points--

1735
01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:10.607
MARISHA: Yeah.

1736
01:04:10.607 --> 01:04:11.832
MATT: And eight points, so you took

1737
01:04:11.832 --> 01:04:13.639
a total of 20 points of poison damage.

1738
01:04:13.639 --> 01:04:16.100
(laughter)

1739
01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.870
MARISHA: With a moment of clarity
of seeing Fjord just lapping

1740
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:23.537
the waves, I'm going to stop

1741
01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:26.311
and get off the bull

1742
01:04:26.311 --> 01:04:28.740
and that's my turn.
SAM: Yep, just like

1743
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.353
a night at the Ranch.
MARISHA: Just like--

1744
01:04:30.353 --> 01:04:32.241
(laughter)

1745
01:04:32.241 --> 01:04:33.990
SAM: It started so well.

1746
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:35.580
Then you realize--
MARISHA: Oh no.

1747
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.378
SAM: Your realize your friend died.

1748
01:04:37.378 --> 01:04:39.735
and you get off the bull.

1749
01:04:39.735 --> 01:04:40.690
(laughter)

1750
01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:42.660
MATT: Which way are you getting off, this way or this way?

1751
01:04:43.712 --> 01:04:45.880
MARISHA: That way's good. Yeah, not in the water.

1752
01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.914
MATT: Okay.

1753
01:04:46.914 --> 01:04:48.875
LAURA: Hey, Caleb!

1754
01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:50.291
SAM: You fucked your friend

1755
01:04:50.291 --> 01:04:51.438
and he had to get off the bull.

1756
01:04:51.438 --> 01:04:53.607
MARISHA: Oh shit! Oh fuck!
TALIESIN: Oh no!

1757
01:04:53.607 --> 01:04:56.250
MARISHA: My boyfriend was here and everything!

1758
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.183
MATT: Okay, that that finishes your turn.

1759
01:04:58.183 --> 01:05:02.023
At the end of your turn, it's is going to use one
of its returning legendary actions.

1760
01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:02.960
TRAVIS: You got a healing arrow,

1761
01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.767
right, Nott? Right?
SAM: Sure.

1762
01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.920
Totally.
TRAVIS: A first aid arrow.

1763
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.791
MATT: 15, 20.
LIAM: That's bad.

1764
01:05:08.791 --> 01:05:10.390
TRAVIS: It's pathetic.

1765
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:12.620
MATT: Nott, you're up. Caleb, you're on you're on deck.

1766
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.340
SAM: Oh, great.
LAURA: Oh, oh, no,

1767
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.010
he's coming for you.

1768
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:19.221
SAM: Do I still have advantage?
TALIESIN: No, advantage is over.

1769
01:05:19.221 --> 01:05:22.060
SAM: Damn.
MATT: It's been over since Yasha's turn.

1770
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.350
LAURA: Sorry, boo.
SAM: I'll just keep shooting.

1771
01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:27.930
I'll lower 20 feet and take a shot.

1772
01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:30.440
MATT: Are you going to go back up 20 feet?
SAM: No lower.

1773
01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.360
I want to be 20 feet off the ground.

1774
01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.810
MATT: You got it.
SAM: So that I can get

1775
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.570
to the ground on a single turn.

1776
01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:37.620
MATT: Okay, there you go.

1777
01:05:39.572 --> 01:05:43.230
SAM: And I will do a long range shot.

1778
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:44.063
MATT: Go for it.

1779
01:05:44.063 --> 01:05:46.280
SAM: With an explosive arrow.
MATT: Sure.

1780
01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.610
SAM: Do I still have Bless?
TALIESIN: You still have Bless.

1781
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:52.062
SAM: Okay, 23 to hit, great.

1782
01:05:54.239 --> 01:05:56.510
And that'll be 10 plus--

1783
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:59.259
What's the explosive arrow again? Let me look.

1784
01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:00.757
I only have two of these.

1785
01:06:03.094 --> 01:06:05.847
TRAVIS: I was like, "Yeah, jump on! Don't hit it!"

1786
01:06:05.847 --> 01:06:07.814
SAM: Where is it? Did I write it down?

1787
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:10.863
I'm looking.

1788
01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:16.270
How much would you have made my explosive bolt add?

1789
01:06:18.669 --> 01:06:20.060
MATT: It'll be an additional 2d6 fire damage.

1790
01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:20.893
SAM: 2d6.

1791
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:25.130
An extra seven points of damage.

1792
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:26.627
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Nice.

1793
01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.100
All right, you have your bonus action still.

1794
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.900
SAM: Yes, I will use it to shoot, reload,

1795
01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.160
fire, terrible. Natural one, miss.

1796
01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.660
You take a d6 damage.
SAM: Oh, yes.

1797
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.547
MATT: I finally damaged you this round, you motherfucker.

1798
01:06:39.547 --> 01:06:40.732
(laughs)

1799
01:06:40.732 --> 01:06:42.540
SAM: Two points.
MATT: Two point of you--

1800
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.311
(arrow misfiring, impacting) "Ah!"

1801
01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:46.977
SAM: And I'm floating, like.

1802
01:06:46.977 --> 01:06:48.570
MATT: The momentum of the hit gives you, like,

1803
01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:49.810
you go gyroscoping.

1804
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:51.865
(laughter)

1805
01:06:51.865 --> 01:06:53.445
I love it. All right, Nott's turn's done.

1806
01:06:53.445 --> 01:06:54.590
Caleb, you're up. Fjord, you're on deck.

1807
01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:57.000
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so Caleb sees all of this mess here

1808
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.430
and looks quickly down to the left and sees them,

1809
01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:01.450
doesn't want to be near them so he's going to slosh

1810
01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:04.310
out of the water to this. Is that 10 feet of movement

1811
01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:05.143
to go here?
MATT: Yes.

1812
01:07:05.143 --> 01:07:08.130
LIAM: Okay, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

1813
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:10.610
I'll hide a little bit behind that bush

1814
01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:14.720
and slap the cat's cradle down into the dry earth here

1815
01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.530
and send Widogast's Web of Fire specifically at that.

1816
01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:20.760
MATT: All righty,
LIAM: Okay.

1817
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:23.880
MATT: It's a dex save?
LIAM: That is a dex save.

1818
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:28.865
MATT: That is a fail. It's going to
use a legendary resistance to succeed.

1819
01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.980
LIAM: That's a lot of ones. Two, that was two, six,

1820
01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:37.967
12, 14,

1821
01:07:37.967 --> 01:07:39.742
25,

1822
01:07:40.817 --> 01:07:43.650
29.

1823
01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:47.830
MATT: 29 points of fire damage reduced by half to 14.

1824
01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:48.663
So as you come on the ground,

1825
01:07:48.663 --> 01:07:50.938
you hit the ground with your hands and watch

1826
01:07:50.938 --> 01:07:53.770
as all of a sudden these multiple piercing,

1827
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.237
burning fuses of arcane fire (hissing)

1828
01:07:56.237 --> 01:07:58.990
snake through the red ground before they vanish below.

1829
01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:01.370
There's a pause before it explodes

1830
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:03.300
beneath, like this giant pillar of fire.

1831
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.900
It lifts off the ground.

1832
01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.286
And lands. (snuffling grunt)

1833
01:08:08.286 --> 01:08:09.460
And turns in your direction.
SAM: Oh no.

1834
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:13.472
LIAM: And I sort of lower four inches down into the bush.

1835
01:08:13.472 --> 01:08:15.100
MATT: Okay, you got it.

1836
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.740
All righty, that brings us to Fjord's turn.

1837
01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.260
I need you to make a death saving throw, buddy.

1838
01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:23.128
SAM: Oh, here we go, no problem.
TRAVIS: All right.

1839
01:08:23.128 --> 01:08:24.340
MARISHA: Come on.
TRAVIS: Better than a 10, right?

1840
01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.550
MARISHA: Yeah, better that a 10. That's all you need.

1841
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:28.620
TRAVIS: 10.
MARISHA: What-- is that?

1842
01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:29.746
MATT: I think it's 10 or above, yeah.

1843
01:08:29.746 --> 01:08:31.363
So that's a success.

1844
01:08:31.363 --> 01:08:32.553
MATT: It's nine or lower that you--

1845
01:08:32.553 --> 01:08:35.222
LAURA: ♪ Good, good, good. ♪

1862

1924
01:11:52.746 --> 01:11:56.096
(groaning) take the impact. It's angry.

All right, since you moved, as it
comes right in front of you, Caleb,

1933
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.510
takes the impact of the Blight, looks back at you,

1934
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:28.980
hears Jester shout back at Fjord

1935
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:33.360

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:39.550
MATT: Well, yeah. He had two
targets and one of them went away.

1939
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:42.678
It would be more useful for him to go-- (heavy footsteps)

1940
01:12:42.678 --> 01:12:44.760
LIAM: Oh, can I get a spell attack of opportunity?

1941
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.490
MATT: You do. Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

1942
01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:50.330
I will just his him with another--
MATT: Or, valid point, actually,

1943
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:53.430
with that, given the point because
I thought you could do that.

1944
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:54.970
He will use his last legendary action,

1945
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.180
at the end of Caduceus' turn to shift out of that space

1946
01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:59.380
without getting attacks of opportunity.

1947
01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:03.334

MATT: I'll take mine.

1951
01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.860
All right, and so we'll go ahead and move in

1952
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.230
right in that space where the four--

1953
01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:16.887
where the three of you and that statue.

And unleash a blast.

1956

1957
01:13:25.662 --> 01:13:27.990

1958
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:30.373

1959

You both succeed, because everyone rolls really fucking high

1968
01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.770
on the things I want to try and do. Beauregard does not.

1969
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:57.174
Beauregard is restrained once again.

1970

LAURA: No, Beau.

1971
01:14:01.235 --> 01:14:02.314
TRAVIS: Wow.

1972
01:14:02.314 --> 01:14:05.932
SAM: Does that cause damage or--
LAURA: It just restrains her.

1973
01:14:05.932 --> 01:14:07.590
TALIESIN: She's restrained for now, and then--

1974
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:10.690

on your side, I swear to god.

1975

1977
01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.050
All righty, that brings us to--

1978
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.710
Gets those legendary actions back at the end of his turn.

1979
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:21.800
Yasha, you're up.

1980
01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.822
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to attack...

1981
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:29.340
Okay, 26.
MATT: 26 hits.

1982
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.718
ASHLEY: Okay, first attack.

1983
01:14:33.984 --> 01:14:35.290
I'm shaking.
LAURA: Kill him!

1984
01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:37.728
ASHLEY: Wait, I'm going to roll it again, Savage Attack.

1985
01:14:37.728 --> 01:14:39.917
MATT: You can do that.
ASHLEY: 10, that's better.

1986
01:14:39.917 --> 01:14:42.750
15, 18.

1987
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:44.700
28 points of damage for the first hit.

1988
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.460
MATT: 28, wow, nice!
ASHLEY: Yeah, still good?

1989
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.602
MATT: Yeah, it's still standing.
ASHLEY: Okay. Fuck.

1990
01:14:52.776 --> 01:14:55.290
(stammering)

1991
01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:56.980
I can't count right now.

1992
01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.500
21.
MATT: 21 hits.

1993
01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.910
ASHLEY: Yes! Okay.

1994
01:15:03.714 --> 01:15:05.465
I'm going to roll again.

1995
01:15:05.465 --> 01:15:10.285
That's better. Six. (stammering)

1996
01:15:10.285 --> 01:15:11.509
14 points of damage.

1997
01:15:11.509 --> 01:15:13.825

ASHLEY: Ugh, he's still going.

1998
01:15:14.822 --> 01:15:17.697
MATT: All right. You swing twice across it.

1999
01:15:17.697 --> 01:15:20.355
You see one of its eyes is
starting to close a bit on one side.

2000
01:15:20.355 --> 01:15:21.438
ASHLEY: Come on.

2001
01:15:21.438 --> 01:15:23.529

TALIESIN: Bullshit, man.

2002
01:15:23.529 --> 01:15:27.530
MATT: You do take seven points of poison damage

2003
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.006
and 11 points points damage.

2004
01:15:29.006 --> 01:15:29.839
TALIESIN: 18.

2005
01:15:31.378 --> 01:15:32.211
MATT: From both of those strikes.

2006
01:15:32.211 --> 01:15:33.940

TRAVIS: (laughs) Ooh!
ASHLEY: Yep. I'm looking rough.

2009
01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.727
All right, end of your turn?

2010
01:15:41.135 --> 01:15:43.578
LAURA: Hey, if we're still alive
after this, let's go to sleep.

2011
01:15:43.578 --> 01:15:47.627
ASHLEY: As a bonus action, I'm going to--
TRAVIS: If we can.

2012
01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:49.110
ASHLEY: -- Healing Hands on myself.

2013
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:50.750
MATT: Is it a bonus action or--
ASHLEY: No, it's not.

2014
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:52.890
I am lying, I'm not doing that, I'm not doing anything

2015
01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:54.240
I'm standing there looking at the bull.

2016
01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.699
MATT: End of your turn, it's going to
use a legendary action to do a hoof attack you.

2017
01:15:56.699 --> 01:15:58.233
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: (like Ashley) Okay!

2018
01:15:58.233 --> 01:16:01.930
(laughter)

2019
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:04.090
MATT: 18 to hit, does that hit?

2020
01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:06.502
ASHLEY: Yeah. That hits.
MATT: Okay.

2021
01:16:06.502 --> 01:16:10.820
TALIESIN: But half damage.
ASHLEY: Yeah. Half damage if it's bludgeoning

2022
01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:11.995
MATT: So

2023
01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:15.380
20 points of bludgeoning damage,

2024
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:16.463
reduced to 10 because you're raging.

2025
01:16:16.463 --> 01:16:18.860
ASHLEY: 10, yeah.
MATT: All righty.

2026
01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:21.620
That finishes this turn. Beauregard, you're up.

2027
01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.710
You are restrained, so you cannot move.

2028
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:25.570
MARISHA: Am I within 20 feet of him?

2029
01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:27.550
MATT: You are within 20 feet, yeah.

2030
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:29.320
MARISHA: All right, I shouldn't do this.

2031
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.678
But maybe we'll sleep. I'm going to--

2032
01:16:31.678 --> 01:16:33.744
SAM: Attack Fjord.

2033
01:16:33.744 --> 01:16:37.160
MARISHA: Punch the waves beneath me as my feet are starting

2034
01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.500
to become fused with the sand and I'm going to use

2035
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:45.040
that kinetic energy of the wave to ignite my fists,

2036
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.830
my lightning gloves.
MATT: Awesome.

2037
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:48.740
MARISHA: And--
MATT: Is it a bonus action

2038
01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.380
to trigger those, or is it a...

2039
01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:53.208
MARISHA: It's--

2040
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:55.840
TRAVIS: ♪ Been one week. ♪

2041
01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.010
MARISHA: "At the start of your turn,

2042
01:16:57.010 --> 01:17:00.140
"you can channel atmospheric electric energy--"
MATT: Okay, cool. So at the start of your turn. You got it.

2043
01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.950
All right, you got it.
MARISHA: "-- to extend my reach

2044
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:05.630
"for one minute." So that's what I am doing.

2045
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:08.289
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2046
01:17:08.289 --> 01:17:10.170
MARISHA: Pop pop.
TRAVIS: Belch.

2047
01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:11.328
MARISHA: Natural 20!

2048
01:17:11.328 --> 01:17:13.020
(cheering)
MATT: Nice!

2049
01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.830
MARISHA: Am I still blessed?

2050
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:18.188
I don't know if it matters because it's 23,

2051
01:17:18.188 --> 01:17:20.128
plus-- 27.

2052
01:17:20.128 --> 01:17:22.109
MATT: Yeah. Motherfuckers!
MARISHA: Okay.

2053
01:17:22.109 --> 01:17:23.458
(laughter)

2054
01:17:23.458 --> 01:17:24.733
MARISHA: I think, do I--

2055
01:17:24.733 --> 01:17:26.914
MATT: I got to get real creative--
ASHLEY: Carmen Sandiego!

2056
01:17:26.914 --> 01:17:28.268
MATT: -- with how you guys [inaudible] in the future.
TRAVIS: No, you don't!

2057
01:17:28.268 --> 01:17:30.658
MATT: Yeah, I do. This is--
TALIESIN: This is nerve-wracking.

2058
01:17:30.658 --> 01:17:31.599
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: This does not

2059
01:17:31.599 --> 01:17:33.570
feel good and I feel like--

2060
01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:36.157
MATT: No, no, I'm learning with each progressive battle.

2061
01:17:36.157 --> 01:17:37.940
TRAVIS: My face is in the ocean sand.

2062
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.122
MARISHA: First is lightning attack damage.

2063
01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:42.750
That's good, 12.
MATT: 12, okay.

2064
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:43.990
MARISHA: And, then 11.

2065
01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.918
LAURA: Isn't one of those doubled?

2066
01:17:46.918 --> 01:17:48.325
MATT: The critical was the first one.
MARISHA: Oh yes,

2067
01:17:48.325 --> 01:17:51.950
so, 18.
MATT: 18 on the first hit. Okay,

2068
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:55.027
MARISHA: And then 11.
MATT: Okay.

2069
01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.667
Okay, so both those impacts, it's still standing.

2070
01:17:59.667 --> 01:18:00.933
LAURA: (groaning)

2071
01:18:02.175 --> 01:18:03.728
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: We're not going to get a...

2072
01:18:03.728 --> 01:18:04.979
How Do You Want to Moo This?

2073
01:18:04.979 --> 01:18:06.020
TRAVIS: Look at that face.

2074
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.686
TRAVIS: How do you go? Do whatever [inaudible].

2075
01:18:07.686 --> 01:18:09.630
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows!

2076
01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:11.972
(screams)

2077
01:18:11.972 --> 01:18:13.520
MATT: You did not think it's
poison damage because she's hitting it

2078
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.690
with lightning damage, technically, right?

2079
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.523
It is lightning damage?

2080
01:18:15.523 --> 01:18:17.440
MARISHA: Yes, it's lightning instead of bludgeoning,

2081
01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.390
which I should've done this whole time if I would've known.

2082
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:20.422
MATT: Well, that's how you figure it out.

2083
01:18:20.422 --> 01:18:21.255
MARISHA: Pop pop.

2084
01:18:21.255 --> 01:18:22.740
LAURA: (laughs)

2085
01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.540
MATT: By the way, I'm sorry, you also disadvantage

2086
01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:26.300
on these attacks because you are restrained.

2087
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.830
I forgot about that.
LIAM: 20.

2088
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:30.650
MATT: That 20. What was that first roll? Was a 20 and?

2089
01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:32.567
So the first roll still hit, this is technically

2090
01:18:32.567 --> 01:18:36.380
your second hit.
MARISHA: All right, all right.

2091
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:39.170
TRAVIS: Actually, that was the cocked one,
so it should be that one.

2092
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:41.880
A single roll, all right?
MATT: Well, the first two

2093
01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.270
she rolled were like, was, like, the first to hit,

2094
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:46.008
which means I'll count that as--

2095
01:18:46.008 --> 01:18:47.186
SAM: Yeah, one hit.
MATT: As one hit.

2096
01:18:47.186 --> 01:18:48.652
MARISHA: One hit.
MATT: So what should be first,

2097
01:18:48.652 --> 01:18:51.120
damage would have been 11, so--
MARISHA: Damage,

2098
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.750
and then this one would be, you said I'm at disadvantage?

2099
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:57.410
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: It's 21 total.

2100
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:59.963
MATT: Hits, so roll damage for the second hit.

2101
01:18:59.963 --> 01:19:02.392
I almost forgot; restrained puts you
at disadvantage with attacks.

2102
01:19:02.392 --> 01:19:04.430
TALIESIN: When does she get to roll to break the restraint?

2103
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.340
LAURA: At the end of the turn.

2104
01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.173
TALIESIN: Okay.

2105
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:10.683
MARISHA: 11 again. Wait, six plus seven is 12.

2106
01:19:10.683 --> 01:19:12.900
TRAVIS: 13.
LAURA: 13.

2107
01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:15.420
MATT: 13.
TALIESIN: We are wrecked.

2108
01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.660
MATT: All right, and you're going to Flurry of Blows?

2109
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:18.976
MARISHA: Huh?
MATT: Flurry of Blows?

2110
01:19:18.976 --> 01:19:20.332
MARISHA: All right, that's the first one.

2111
01:19:20.332 --> 01:19:22.473
So that's 13 damage.
MATT: No, those were your first two attacks.

2112
01:19:22.473 --> 01:19:24.875
You have two more attacks with disadvantage.
MARISHA: Okay, sorry, sorry.

2113
01:19:24.875 --> 01:19:26.575
MATT: It's okay, it's okay.

2114
01:19:26.575 --> 01:19:29.000
MARISHA: The second one. Pop pop.

2115
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:29.971
Okay.

2116
01:19:29.971 --> 01:19:31.796
Hemmy hemmy hemmy heh.

2117
01:19:34.301 --> 01:19:36.260
21.
MATT: 21 hits.

2118
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.400
MARISHA: I'm just going to do the damage.

2119
01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.325
So I don't get confused-ed.

2120
01:19:40.325 --> 01:19:41.391
13 again,

2121
01:19:41.391 --> 01:19:42.852
seven plus six.
MATT: All righty.

2122
01:19:42.852 --> 01:19:44.263
SAM: Good, good.
MATT: And last attack.

2123
01:19:44.263 --> 01:19:45.396
TRAVIS: God, jeez!

2124
01:19:45.396 --> 01:19:47.312
MARISHA: And then one last attack.

2125
01:19:47.312 --> 01:19:50.132
Jesus--
SAM: Are these punches lightning--

2126
01:19:50.132 --> 01:19:51.517
MARISHA: There're lightning punches.

2127
01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:56.987
I don't think that's going to make it.

2128
01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.890
17.
MATT: 17 misses.

2129
01:20:01.473 --> 01:20:02.306
LAURA: Okay.

2130
01:20:02.306 --> 01:20:04.952
MATT: Okay, I need you to make a
constitution saving throw for me, Beauregard.

2131
01:20:04.952 --> 01:20:05.785
TALIESIN: With a d4.

2132
01:20:05.785 --> 01:20:07.477
MARISHA: I feel like one would've been--

2133
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.560
TRAVIS: Wow, is that cocked?
MATT: No.

2134
01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.860
TRAVIS: It was a journey.

2135
01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:13.835
MARISHA: It doesn't matter,

2136
01:20:13.835 --> 01:20:17.528
it's a natural one.
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake.

2137
01:20:17.528 --> 01:20:18.960
LAURA: No!

2138
01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.407
ASHLEY: What happened, what happened?

2139
01:20:20.407 --> 01:20:22.995
LAURA: She's petrified?!
Are you petrified?! Is she petrified?!

2140
01:20:22.995 --> 01:20:24.461
MARISHA: Am I petrified?
TRAVIS: Petrified.

2141
01:20:24.461 --> 01:20:25.505
LAURA: No!
SAM: Yeah.

2142
01:20:25.505 --> 01:20:27.899
LAURA: Oh my god, if we become petrified then he breaks us.

2143
01:20:27.899 --> 01:20:31.101
MARISHA: He gores us? Then we're deadzos.

2144
01:20:31.101 --> 01:20:33.109
TALIESIN: That's the end of it.
MATT: Yep!

2145
01:20:33.109 --> 01:20:35.248
LAURA: Don't you 'yep' me, Matthew Mercer!

2146
01:20:35.248 --> 01:20:37.092
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2147
01:20:37.092 --> 01:20:40.084
Oh man. Oh man, shit just got fucking real!

2148
01:20:40.084 --> 01:20:42.830
MARISHA: I wonder if I had fucking killed it.

2149
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:44.510
MATT: That finishes Beau's turn.

2150
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:45.425
It's going to use...

2151
01:20:45.425 --> 01:20:46.925
MARISHA: If I had not missed.

2152
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:52.970
MATT: It's going to use another legendary action

2153
01:20:54.170 --> 01:20:57.700
to move back.

2154
01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.220
LAURA: Moo-ve back.

2155
01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:02.584
MARISHA: Bitch, I'm a cow. Bitch, I'm a cow.

2156
01:21:02.584 --> 01:21:06.533
MATT: To get about, we'll say there, starting to gauge its--

2157
01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:10.993
LAURA: Does he realize that Jester duplicate is an illusion?

2158
01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:13.950
MATT: I don't know.
LAURA: Okay.

2159
01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:17.080
MATT: We'll see.
LIAM: Yes, you do.

2160
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:21.534
MATT: All righty. At the end of that,
it comes to Nott's turn.

2161
01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.120
MARISHA: That was such a journey.

2162
01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.020
SAM: It says, with Levitate, "If you are--

2163
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.700
"you can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet.

2164
01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:33.480
"If you are the target you can move up or down as part

2165
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.380
"of your move."
MATT: Correct.

2166
01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:37.710
SAM: Does that mean it's my movement to--

2167
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:40.518
MATT: Yeah, it's your speed.
So you can go 20 feet down, 20 feet up.

2168
01:21:42.235 --> 01:21:43.810
SAM: Hmm.

2169
01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:46.460
MATT: It's not Fly. You can't, like, move.

2170
01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:48.243
SAM: No, no, no.
TRAVIS: Your moo-vement.

2171
01:21:48.243 --> 01:21:50.730
SAM: How far away from Beauregard?

2172
01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:55.630
MATT: From Beauregard, you are about 40-45 feet.

2173
01:21:56.735 --> 01:21:58.043
TRAVIS: Son of a fuck.

2174
01:21:59.767 --> 01:22:01.458
SAM: And how far is Mage Hand?

2175
01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:03.982
Shit.

2176
01:22:03.982 --> 01:22:06.167
Well, she's not going to die <i>this</i> round.

2177
01:22:06.167 --> 01:22:08.730
TALIESIN: (uncertain noises)
LAURA: (uncertain stammering)

2178
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:12.230
It's only a few moves before I can go and I can help her,

2179
01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:13.557
but if he uses his legendary actions--

2180
01:22:13.557 --> 01:22:14.390
TALIESIN: I was also going to say:

2181
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:18.224
Can you more far enough to Greater Restoration?

2182
01:22:18.224 --> 01:22:20.375
LAURA: ♪ Bitch, I got a duplicate ♪

2183
01:22:20.375 --> 01:22:22.358
♪ She can move really fucking far ♪

2184
01:22:22.358 --> 01:22:23.308
TALIESIN: Fair.
LAURA: No, she can't.

2185
01:22:23.308 --> 01:22:25.487
SAM: Okay, is it engaged with anyone? No.

2186
01:22:25.487 --> 01:22:26.820
TALIESIN: I was going to say: I don't know this shit.

2187
01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:27.920
SAM: It's not engaged with anyone.

2188
01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.370
I wouldn't get advantage, right?

2189
01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:30.203
MATT: No, it is not.

2190
01:22:30.203 --> 01:22:31.110
LIAM: Can't see a ring.

2191
01:22:35.122 --> 01:22:36.800
LAURA: Fucking shit.

2192
01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.660
SAM: This is tricky.

2193
01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.500
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky.

2194
01:22:41.324 --> 01:22:43.824
♪ Ba da bup, ba da bup, ba da bup. ♪

2195
01:22:46.774 --> 01:22:50.460
TRAVIS: What is-- this is a puzzle.

2196
01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.320
SAM: I got to get over there, but I don't think

2197
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.672
I can make it in time to really help.

2198
01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:57.380
But maybe it'll be dead before.

2199
01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.900
LAURA: Kill it, just try to kill it.

2200
01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.291
MARISHA: It's got to be close.
SAM: All right, let me shoot it.

2201
01:23:01.291 --> 01:23:03.582
I'll just shoot it.
MATT: It's really hurt.

2202
01:23:03.582 --> 01:23:04.923
MARISHA: Got to be close.

2203
01:23:04.923 --> 01:23:07.458
I'm so mad I didn't get that last hit.

2204
01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:10.750
SAM: Okay, I'll just shoot it once.
TALIESIN: Add the d4.

2205
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:12.108
SAM: With a d4.

2206
01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:15.900
That's 23 to hit.
MATT: 23 hits.

2207
01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.470
SAM: It's just a single thing.

2208
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:18.303
ASHLEY: Come on, come on.

2209
01:23:18.303 --> 01:23:19.578
Eight points of damage.

2210
01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:21.661
MATT: Eight points of damage. All righty.

2211
01:23:24.081 --> 01:23:26.603
SAM: (whispered) Not enough.
LAURA: Do it again, do it again.

2212
01:23:27.724 --> 01:23:29.680
SAM: (whispered) Not enough.

2213
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.346
All right, I'll shoot again.

2214
01:23:31.346 --> 01:23:32.678
MATT: Okay.
SAM: I guess.

2215
01:23:32.678 --> 01:23:33.978
MARISHA: Hit it. Kill it.

2216
01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:36.790
SAM: Yeah, so that'll hit with 25.

2217
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:37.950
MATT: 25 hits, roll damage.

2218
01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:41.540
SAM: Nine points of damage.

2219
01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:42.752
MATT: Nine points of damage, all right.

2220
01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:43.585
LAURA: (groaning)

2221
01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:46.390
MATT: You guys are rolling continuously high tonight,

2222
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:50.842
to a point where it's spooky and frustrating for me.

2223
01:23:50.842 --> 01:23:53.530
TALIESIN: (groaning)

2224
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:54.363
MATT: It's good to know.
TRAVIS: Yeah,

2225
01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:56.280
I'm glad it's just a one side of the table thing.

2226
01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.166
We feel totally calm.

2227
01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.650
(laughter)

2228
01:24:00.650 --> 01:24:03.580
SAM: And I guess I will...shit.

2229
01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.034
LAURA: You're going to shit?
ASHLEY: Guess I will shit.

2230
01:24:07.034 --> 01:24:08.930
MATT: Make a--
LIAM: (thuds)

2231
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:09.763
MARISHA: Ah!

2232
01:24:10.716 --> 01:24:11.549
MATT: (thuds)

2233
01:24:12.938 --> 01:24:13.781
LIAM: And it falls over dead.

2234
01:24:13.781 --> 01:24:15.158
TRAVIS: That's pretty good.

2235
01:24:15.158 --> 01:24:16.880
LIAM: (mooing)

2236
01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.020
SAM: If I just dropped Levitation, I'd fall 20 feet.

2237
01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.220
MATT: You would, yes.

2238
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.628
SAM: And probably be prone?

2239
01:24:23.628 --> 01:24:26.044
MATT: Unless you managed to catch yourself.

2240
01:24:26.044 --> 01:24:29.211
SAM: But, like, could I drop it and also run my movement?

2241
01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:31.835
MATT: It's possible.

2242
01:24:31.835 --> 01:24:33.701
TRAVIS: But if you are knocked prone,
it's half your movement.

2243
01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.623
SAM: Yeah, and I would take some damage.

2244
01:24:35.623 --> 01:24:37.030
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: That's 20 feet drop.

2245
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:39.120
Well, let's try it, I'm going to drop.

2246
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.480
MATT: Okay, roll an acrobatics check.

2247
01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.930
TALIESIN: With a d4.
LIAM: You're ridiculously high.

2248
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:46.500
TALIESIN: Is it-- No, actually, no. Never mind, no d4.

2249
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:50.650
SAM: 14 plus--
LAURA: Acrobatics.

2250
01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:52.666
SAM: Oh yeah, 23.

2251
01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:54.249
MATT: 23? Yeah, you're fine.

2252
01:24:54.249 --> 01:24:56.540
You still take damage as you fall.

2253
01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:59.660
You take nine points of bludgeoning damage as

2254
01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:03.552
the body just cracks into you as you land--
LAURA: You must have landed on a rock

2255
01:25:03.552 --> 01:25:05.164
under the sand.

2256
01:25:05.164 --> 01:25:07.556
MATT: Right on the kneecap, you're like, "Ugh!"

2257
01:25:07.556 --> 01:25:09.110
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: And then

2258
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:12.120
I will use my movement to run around

2259
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.530
the bull--
LAURA: It does extra damage

2260
01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:16.667
because you're expecting sand, you know.

2261
01:25:16.667 --> 01:25:19.766
MATT: 30, 35. 35 is your movement, yes?

2262
01:25:19.766 --> 01:25:20.659
SAM: 35, yeah.

2263
01:25:20.659 --> 01:25:24.654
MATT: All right. That's it.
SAM: That's it.

2264
01:25:24.654 --> 01:25:26.220
That brings us-- at the end of your turn,

2265
01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:28.645
it's going to use its final

2266
01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.092
legendary action to go ahead and--

2267
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:39.325
Yeah, it fucking hates this cleric shit.

2268
01:25:39.325 --> 01:25:41.500
TALIESIN: I did it once.

2269
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.653
LAURA: (laughs)

2270
01:25:43.653 --> 01:25:44.700
MATT: I <i>hate</i> Bless.

2271
01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.002
TALIESIN: I know.

2272
01:25:46.002 --> 01:25:47.702
MATT: It's such bullshit.

2273
01:25:47.702 --> 01:25:50.532
Two clerics in the party; it's such bullshit.

2274
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.820
All right, Caleb, you're up.

2275
01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:56.212
LIAM: Okay, I go scrabbling up that little mound there

2276
01:25:56.212 --> 01:25:59.795
trying to get its attention shouting:
You! Cow! <i>Arschloch</i>!

2277
01:25:59.795 --> 01:26:02.270
And I will slap the cat's cradle down.

2278
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:03.700
No, I'll go to the top.
MATT: Oh, to the very top

2279
01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.533
over here?
LIAM: Yeah.

2280
01:26:04.533 --> 01:26:06.820
And I will slap the cat's cradle down on the stone

2281
01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.760
and send it again towards the one single target down

2282
01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.920
in front of me.
MATT: You got it.

2283
01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:11.878
LIAM: At 5th-level.

2284
01:26:13.954 --> 01:26:14.787
MARISHA: Kill it.

2285
01:26:14.787 --> 01:26:18.404
MATT: It's going to take its
third legendary save to succeed.

2286
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.710
LIAM: 33.
MATT: 33.

2287
01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:28.782
Take it to six--
LIAM: No, need more. Eight.

2288
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:34.720
Plus 10, what did I say?
TRAVIS: 43 total.

2289
01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.460
LIAM: Plus that 10?
TRAVIS: Plus 10, yeah.

2290
01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:39.430
LIAM: And I did a 5th-level, so 48 total.

2291
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:40.650
MATT: 48 total.
LIAM: Yeah.

2292
01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:41.583
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2293
01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:43.291
(cheering)
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

2294
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.320
LIAM: I will send the fire burning down the stone

2295
01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.820
into the earth again and let it gather and hold

2296
01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:54.092
and hold my hands down, and then rip the hands up and then,

2297
01:26:54.092 --> 01:26:57.095
(flames whooshing) from underneath.
SAM: Flame broiled!

2298
01:26:57.095 --> 01:27:01.049
LIAM: Burn up into the hole that the Disintegrate left

2299
01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.960
and then scorch inside and burn it from within.

2300
01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.407
MATT: Your watch as it burns up in the inside.

2301
01:27:05.407 --> 01:27:06.240
(grunting)

2302
01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.992
The middle of its torso is incinerated

2303
01:27:08.992 --> 01:27:11.150
in a circular pillar as it bursts through the top

2304
01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:13.081
the middle armor plates (creaking)

2305
01:27:13.081 --> 01:27:15.270
bending backward and heated orange.

2306
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:17.980
The earth and the sand that gets shot up as part

2307
01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.990
of this explosion (whooshing)

2308
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:22.120
suddenly solidifies into points of glass

2309
01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.390
from the extreme heat and it's caught

2310
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:27.940
in midair, dead, pierced by all these shards

2311
01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.900
of immediately solidified glass from the blast.

2312
01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.491
LIAM: That's how you make a statue.

2313
01:27:33.491 --> 01:27:34.786
(laughter)

2314
01:27:34.786 --> 01:27:36.590
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: And a steak.

2315
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:38.249
SAM: Well done!

2316
01:27:38.249 --> 01:27:41.166
TRAVIS: What happens to the piles of petrification?

2317
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.130
LAURA: I am immediately going to leap off the rock

2318
01:27:45.130 --> 01:27:48.697
into the water and run towards Beau.
SAM: As am I.

2319
01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:51.210
TALIESIN: I'm-- is this dead?
MATT: It is very dead.

2320
01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:53.760
TALIESIN: I'm running immediately to my family members.

2321
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.760
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: The two I see.

2322
01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:58.990
MATT: All right, you rush on over towards...

2323
01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.810
You see over on that side.

2324
01:28:05.890 --> 01:28:07.160
What looks to be...

2325
01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.423
Constance-- or actually, no, with those right there.

2326
01:28:11.423 --> 01:28:12.740
Dragging it over there would be...

2327
01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:19.330
Calliope and Cornelius, Cornelius dragging Calliope.

2328
01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:22.100
TALIESIN: Okay, immediate Greater Restoration
on both of them.

2329
01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.460
MATT: On both of them?
TALIESIN: Yep.

2330
01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.650
Burning burning my 5th and 6th.

2331
01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:29.150
MATT: Okay. What do you guys doing?

2332
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:31.750
LAURA: Think Nott and I get to Beau around the same time.

2333
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:35.040
Right as I'm about to cast Greater Restoration.

2334
01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:39.560
SAM: I whip out my oil, my-- what is it called?

2335
01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.668
It's called something.

2336
01:28:41.668 --> 01:28:42.809
LAURA: (panicked) Beau, Beau!

2337
01:28:42.809 --> 01:28:45.390
SAM: I got it, I got it--
LAURA: What is it you have?

2338
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:49.230
SAM: I bought this shit! It's called willowshade oil,

2339
01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:51.770
and it un-petrifies people.
LAURA: Well then, fucking do it!

2340
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:53.920
SAM: What part of our body should I rub it on?

2341
01:28:56.477 --> 01:28:58.820
LAURA: Her tattoo, do it on her tattoo because it's special.

2342
01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.670
SAM: Okay, so I'll go around her back

2343
01:29:00.670 --> 01:29:04.300
and I just sort of give her a little neck massage

2344
01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:08.240
with some oil and see if it starts to work.

2345
01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.073
MATT: Okay.

2346
01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.580
As you apply the oil,
because is has been within one minute

2347
01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:18.570
of the petrification, slowly the gray, hardened shape

2348
01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:22.310
of Beauregard's stone form begins to relax

2349
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:25.970
into your hands and begin to warm until eventually,

2350
01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:29.480
Beauregard begins to return to her normal state.

2351
01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:34.025
SAM: Oof, you got a little knot here.

2352
01:29:34.025 --> 01:29:35.376
LAURA and SAM: On your back.

2353
01:29:35.376 --> 01:29:36.750
(laughter)

2354
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:40.040
MATT: As you finish casting Greater Restoration,

2355
01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.580
you can see Cornelius dragging, first, Calliope backward.

2356
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.929
Before you cast it on her. He's like,

2357
01:29:46.929 --> 01:29:49.662
"Come on. I have to--

2358
01:29:49.662 --> 01:29:50.645
"What?"

2359
01:29:50.645 --> 01:29:51.803
TALIESIN: One moment.

2360
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.550
MATT: "Caduceus, what?"

2361
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:56.480
TALIESIN: I'll explain.

2362
01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:58.505
MATT: As you touch Calliope,

2363
01:29:58.505 --> 01:30:01.821
slowly she begins to return back

2364
01:30:01.821 --> 01:30:05.750
to her normal self, her arm and mid-swing with

2365
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:10.378
a heavy mace and she just goes, "Son of a!"

2366
01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.590
Falls on the ground as Cornelius drops her.

2367
01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.030
Calliope looks up to you and goes,

2368
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:22.258
"Caduceus?"

2369
01:30:23.616 --> 01:30:25.874
TALIESIN: It's been so long.

2370
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.420
LAURA: Caduceus, are there any other family members here?

2371
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.467
MATT: Calliope stands up. (pained grunt)

2372
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:43.583
TALIESIN: I don't know.

2373
01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:47.375
LAURA: I'm going to run around look for anybody

2374
01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:49.083
that looks like Caduceus.

2375
01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:51.198
MATT: Okay, there's the scattering of people.

2376
01:30:51.198 --> 01:30:52.377
SAM: How's Fjord?

2377
01:30:52.377 --> 01:30:53.813
ASHLEY: I'm going to run over to Fjord,

2378
01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.770
help him out of the water

2379
01:30:56.770 --> 01:31:01.300
and touch him and cast Healing Hands.

2380
01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.320
LAURA: Touch him where?
ASHLEY: Just his hands.

2381
01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.943
ASHLEY: Just pull him up out of the water.

2382
01:31:04.943 --> 01:31:06.340
LAURA: Cool.

2383
01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:07.412
ASHLEY: Not my thing.

2384
01:31:07.412 --> 01:31:10.140
(laughter)

2385
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:11.665
SAM: Grab him by the dick.

2386
01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:14.950
ASHLEY: 11 points of healing.

2387
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:17.050
TRAVIS: 11? Great. I'll take it.

2388
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:19.343
Thank you.

2389
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:24.210
LIAM: Caleb is going to walk up to the cow

2390
01:31:24.210 --> 01:31:27.870
and start to examine it, understand what it is, maybe.

2391
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:32.013
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana or history check. Your choice.

2392
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.603
LIAM: That is a 19.

2393
01:31:36.453 --> 01:31:37.969
MATT: A 19?
LIAM: Yeah.

2394
01:31:37.969 --> 01:31:38.802
MATT: Okay.

2395
01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:41.750
Looking at the way it's...

2396
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.750
like you acknowledge that this is a form of a gorgon,

2397
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:49.440
which is a type of terrible entity,

2398
01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.770
a monstrosity that has had uses throughout

2399
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:57.770
the ages as trained guardians of vaults of mages

2400
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.260
been known to be-- some holy sites have...

2401
01:32:04.563 --> 01:32:06.510
some systems of belief would have one

2402
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:08.680
of these creatures possibly that are protected

2403
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.490
and they're also been weaponized in the past.

2404
01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:15.392
But this one's heavily twisted, mutated

2405
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:19.780
in ways that remind you of tales of wide corruption

2406
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.690
that was once utilized by agents of Xhorhas back

2407
01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:25.627
during the calamity to the far east.

2408
01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:29.380
Nature's denizens were usually found and twisted

2409
01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:33.050
to assail their homelands and spread destruction

2410
01:32:33.050 --> 01:32:35.010
and used as implements of war on the front lines

2411
01:32:35.010 --> 01:32:37.626
in those age old times.

2412
01:32:39.001 --> 01:32:41.084
LIAM: Does it look like there's anything salvageable

2413
01:32:41.084 --> 01:32:43.125
or of use on this creature's--?

2414
01:32:43.125 --> 01:32:44.972
MATT: Not with the way you killed it.

2415
01:32:44.972 --> 01:32:47.527
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Yeah. Disintegrate.

2416
01:32:47.527 --> 01:32:48.860
MATT: But you do notice, the front

2417
01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.072
of its face resembles a classic bull-like head,

2418
01:32:52.072 --> 01:32:53.552
but it's a bit swollen at the front,

2419
01:32:53.552 --> 01:32:55.330
and as opposed to a normal jaw,

2420
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:57.110
its mouth opens up into two parts

2421
01:32:57.110 --> 01:33:00.020
of this big scoop shovel and there's no teeth.

2422
01:33:01.303 --> 01:33:02.765
LAURA: Ew, weird.

2423
01:33:06.015 --> 01:33:07.673
He eats plankton!

2424
01:33:08.848 --> 01:33:11.073
LIAM: Just sucks down krill.

2425
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:18.830
MATT: Cornelius goes, "How did you get here? What happened?

2426
01:33:22.037 --> 01:33:25.030
"I see you managed to deal with that thing right over there.

2427
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:28.709
"Thank you for that. I assume these are your friends.

2428
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:32.980
"Hi, I'm Cornelius, I'm Caduceus' father,"

2429
01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:37.270
and you see this large, older firbolg, similar in appearance

2430
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:40.275
to Caduceus, this though bit thicker, a bit portlier,

2431
01:33:40.275 --> 01:33:43.790
gray hair, braided in two sides down the front.

2432
01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.730
Dangling these little tufts at the
bottom that have a bit of jewelry.

2433
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:52.008
(as Cornelius) "This is Calliope,

2434
01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.442
"Caduceus' younger sister."

2435
01:33:55.442 --> 01:33:58.100
And you see she's wearing a similar
chest plate to Caduceus', actually.

2436
01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:01.380
The same coloration and design and it's funny,

2437
01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:03.680
of the two of them which look very much what you assume,

2438
01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.420
Caduceus' appearance being what it is,

2439
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:11.370
his father a little more cartoony variation of that.

2440
01:34:11.370 --> 01:34:15.460
Calliope looks stoic and badass.

2441
01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.410
She looks up the rest of you, holding her mace at her side.

2442
01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.900
(as Calliope) "It's a pleasure to meet you.

2443
01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:25.947
"Caduceus, thank you."

2444
01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:30.250
TALIESIN: You were both gone a very long time.

2445
01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:34.974
I waited and...

2446
01:34:34.974 --> 01:34:37.140
no one returned.

2447
01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:41.953
And I know I wasn't supposed to leave, but I left.

2448
01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.547
Is anybody else here?

2449
01:34:50.204 --> 01:34:52.071
MATT: (as Cornelius) "I mean...

2450
01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:55.750
"I think I-- somewhere around here

2451
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:59.720
"I saw your mother," and he looks over and you can see,

2452
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.070
just beyond the tree, one of the standing bodies

2453
01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.200
is indeed Constance.
LAURA: Oh, good.

2454
01:35:08.175 --> 01:35:11.040
Am I near Constance?

2455
01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.252
MATT: Right there.

2456
01:35:12.252 --> 01:35:16.001
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to run over
to her and cast Greater Restoration.

2457
01:35:16.001 --> 01:35:16.834
MATT: Okay.

2458
01:35:19.690 --> 01:35:21.760
As she, in the middle of her mid-battle form,

2459
01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.940
like-- "(grunts)

2460
01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.773
"Whoa, what?"

2461
01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:32.000
LAURA: Don't worry, you're safe.

2462
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.530
MATT: Just drops her weapon and runs towards Caduceus,

2463
01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:38.388
gives a huge hug and picks him up a little bit.

2464
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:44.720
She has, like-- it's short on the sides

2465
01:35:46.050 --> 01:35:50.000
and then has a soft mohawk that braids

2466
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.950
into a single long braid down the back.

2467
01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:57.850
She's wearing these gray travel robes,

2468
01:35:57.850 --> 01:36:00.640
just a little bit of leather armor underneath.

2469
01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.757
She's picks up-- "I'm so happy to see you."

2470
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:13.506
TALIESIN: I was so worried.

2471
01:36:15.031 --> 01:36:16.023
That thing.

2472
01:36:20.186 --> 01:36:21.520
Where's Corrin?

2473
01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.568
MATT: "I came here with Corrin."

2474
01:36:22.568 --> 01:36:25.260
She turns back and looks in the direction of the--

2475
01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:26.240
MARISHA: Bull.

2476
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:29.901
MATT: -- shattered statue that was right at her side.

2477
01:36:29.901 --> 01:36:31.801
SAM: Oh no.

2478
01:36:37.293 --> 01:36:41.093
MATT: You see she takes a couple steps forward.

2479
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:43.810
Takes a couple more steps forward.

2480
01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:51.240
Leans down, picks up one piece that looks like

2481
01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.110
the shoulders and head of the statue,

2482
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:57.580
chipped and broken itself, its face recoiling

2483
01:36:57.580 --> 01:37:00.550
in surprise. Also a firbolg.

2484
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:02.528
LAURA: How small are the pieces?

2485
01:37:03.439 --> 01:37:06.130
MATT: I mean, there are probably six or seven larger pieces

2486
01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:08.490
and a few dozen smaller elements

2487
01:37:08.490 --> 01:37:09.500
that have been scattered a bit.

2488
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:12.280
It wasn't enough impact to pulverize.

2489
01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.260
It just nudged and broken as it went through

2490
01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:17.050
it wasn't at a full run, thankfully,

2491
01:37:17.050 --> 01:37:19.590
but it's a lot of pieces--
LAURA: If it's not totally awkward.

2492
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:21.600
I'm going to try to get the pieces together

2493
01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.890
and try to reassemble the body as best I can.

2494
01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.830
MATT: Okay, as you reach and start doing this,

2495
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:31.700
you can see Constance is just holding the head,

2496
01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:34.660
aghast. You feel, Caduceus, your father's hand

2497
01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:39.625
come onto your shoulder and in that focused--

2498
01:37:40.690 --> 01:37:43.750
or that that unfocused state of your mother,

2499
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:45.310
Jester begins to sift through and suddenly

2500
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:47.160
her eyes catch yours,

2501
01:37:49.421 --> 01:37:51.862
and she gets down and starts trying to help--

2502
01:37:51.862 --> 01:37:53.180
ASHLEY: I go over and I help as well.

2503
01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:55.502
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make
an investigation check, Jester.

2504
01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:57.380
SAM: I'm going to go help.
MATT: Okay.

2505
01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.000
Do it with advantage, yes.

2506
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.764
LAURA: With advantage.
MATT: Because Nott is helping.

2507
01:38:01.764 --> 01:38:03.428
LAURA: Okay.

2508
01:38:06.278 --> 01:38:07.910
Okay, okay.

2509
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:10.695
19?
MATT: 19, okay.

2510
01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:13.840
You pull together what you think

2511
01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:17.072
is the majority of the stone body.

2512
01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.358
It's too hard to tell at this moment.

2513
01:38:23.358 --> 01:38:24.191
LAURA: Okay.

2514
01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:27.930
TALIESIN: I'm scanning for any anybody else.

2515
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:30.680
I'm not really moving yet. I'm just looking to see

2516
01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.697
if I see--
MATT: Make a perception check.

2517
01:38:33.603 --> 01:38:34.936
TALIESIN: I'm going to Bless myself,

2518
01:38:34.936 --> 01:38:36.235
which I don't normally do for this,

2519
01:38:36.235 --> 01:38:38.001
but I am in that space.

2520
01:38:38.001 --> 01:38:40.151
Maybe I can do one piece at a time.

2521
01:38:40.151 --> 01:38:41.717
I don't think it'll work.

2522
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:45.470
TALIESIN: 26.
MATT: 26.

2523
01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:48.910
You do not see any other firbolgs

2524
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:51.570
in the vicinity of where you're standing.

2525
01:38:51.570 --> 01:38:53.610
You do see out of some of the individuals here--

2526
01:38:53.610 --> 01:38:56.500
and a lot of them, at a glance, their arms are broken off.

2527
01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:59.100
Some of them are have already taken a lot of hits over time,

2528
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.380
whether it be by this creature or just wear and tear

2529
01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:03.920
for how long they've been in this open space

2530
01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:06.470
and nature is taking its toll on their stone forms.

2531
01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.800
You do see some figures,

2532
01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.510
one nearby that is a an elf

2533
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:16.280
that is dressed in a very...

2534
01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.610
pious robes

2535
01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:24.310
and carries a symbol of Avandra

2536
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:26.520
around their neck, hand reaching forward

2537
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.653
like a, "Stop, don't" expression locked in stone.

2538
01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:32.808
But nobody of your family.

2539
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.678
TALIESIN: So Constance and Cornelius are fine

2540
01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:38.512
and Calliope's fine.
MATT: Calliope's fine.

2541
01:39:38.512 --> 01:39:39.861
Corrin's been broken.

2542
01:39:39.861 --> 01:39:41.494
You have not found Clarabelle or Colton.

2543
01:39:41.494 --> 01:39:42.740
TALIESIN: No Colton, no Clarabelle.

2544
01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.460
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Just broken Corrin.

2545
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.293
Okay.

2546
01:39:48.479 --> 01:39:53.230
I have a brother and sister still somewhere here.

2547
01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:55.180
SAM: Here?
TALIESIN: Maybe

2548
01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.747
ASHLEY: Is Corrin a sister?

2549
01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:00.110
TALIESIN: Corrin's my aunt.

2550
01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:04.503
MARISHA: I start looking at the ones pulverized near me.

2551
01:40:04.503 --> 01:40:06.650
TRAVIS: I'll come check all of these.

2552
01:40:06.650 --> 01:40:08.135
MATT: Okay, you got it.

2553
01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.900
Looking at all the bodies,

2554
01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:16.410
some of them look to be travelers,

2555
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:18.160
they're dressed for a long journey.

2556
01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.570
They all appear to be in the midst

2557
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:25.830
of either running, defending themselves

2558
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:28.650
or absolute abject terror.

2559
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:33.630
You see some that are dragonborn,

2560
01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:35.160
you see some that are dwarven.

2561
01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.900
It's a diverse array here, whether they be pilgrims

2562
01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:42.360
or adventurers or members of the actual circle here

2563
01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.460
in the cave that you were walking towards.

2564
01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:46.820
You can't tell right now because they're all made of stone.

2565
01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.220
TRAVIS: And the cave is that direction?

2566
01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.950
MATT: Further this direction, yes.

2567
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:54.690
LAURA: Would it be possible-- I'm going to try using Mending

2568
01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:57.810
on each individual piece together.

2569
01:40:57.810 --> 01:40:59.968
MATT: You have the Mending cantrip?
LAURA: Yes.

2570
01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.410
It's as long as the break or tear's no longer than one foot

2571
01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:08.320
in any way, but if I'm going one piece at a time,

2572
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.430
using Mending, I don't know

2573
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:10.900
if that's going to make a difference.

2574
01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:12.640
SAM: It's going to be a lot of casting.
LAURA: A lot of casting

2575
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.530
it's going to take a long time because

2576
01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:15.567
it takes a minute each time.

2577
01:41:15.567 --> 01:41:17.233
LIAM: And maybe there is a chunk of

2578
01:41:17.233 --> 01:41:18.500
glue just for that--
LAURA: Exactly--

2579
01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:19.608
LIAM: -- one piece.
LAURA: Yeah,

2580
01:41:19.608 --> 01:41:21.640
the smaller pieces maybe try Mending on it,

2581
01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:25.405
and then we also have a glue that covers a square foot.

2582
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:28.710
MATT: You do.
LAURA: That we can try to combine--

2583
01:41:28.710 --> 01:41:30.612
MATT: You can certainly try.

2584
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:33.650
I will say with the pieces you found,

2585
01:41:33.650 --> 01:41:34.920
go ahead and make a medicine check

2586
01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:38.160
to try and understand where they might land within its body.

2587
01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:42.660
This is an understanding of the physical body.

2588
01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:44.650
LIAM: Caleb pulls out the pearl and places

2589
01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:47.330
it on Jester's head and mutters for a while

2590
01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:49.660
and little patterns--
TALIESIN: Tap you as I walk by

2591
01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:51.860
because I'm going to go to the other broken statue.

2592
01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:55.200
MARISHA: And I'm there sorting
the broken statue with Caduceus.

2593
01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:59.290
LAURA: Guidance, okay.
TALIESIN: I'm going to just...

2594
01:41:59.290 --> 01:42:00.998
LIAM: You have one re-roll if you need it.

2595
01:42:00.998 --> 01:42:02.215
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Re-roll it.

2596
01:42:02.215 --> 01:42:03.910
LAURA: Re-roll it.

2597
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:06.220
TALIESIN: I'm just going to grab
Calliope and walk to the other statue.

2598
01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:09.570
LAURA: That is a-- ooh, and a d4.

2599
01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:13.640
Oh, good!

2600
01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:16.430
Okay, so that's 29.

2601
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:20.214
MATT: Jesus Christ, you guys are level 11?

2602
01:42:20.214 --> 01:42:21.230
(laughter)

2603
01:42:21.230 --> 01:42:22.900
TALIESIN: We had some bad luck.

2604
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.720
TRAVIS: We've had some good rolls and then some shit rolls.

2605
01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.210
MATT: Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

2606
01:42:27.210 --> 01:42:28.800
All right, okay.

2607
01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.970
You take a moment to inspect all the pieces of the body

2608
01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:37.080
and quickly begin to assemble and jigsaw them

2609
01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.420
where they fit both--
LAURA: I spent a lot of time

2610
01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:41.360
with puzzles.
MATT: This is very-- apparently,

2611
01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.240
yes, you have.

2612
01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:44.950
Well, not just that, but studying physiology

2613
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:47.500
in the presence of where your mother's work office was.

2614
01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:52.084
TALIESIN: One of those 3-D jigsaws of the human body.

2615
01:42:52.084 --> 01:42:52.917
MATT: There you go.
SAM: You're doing a puzzle

2616
01:42:52.917 --> 01:42:54.890
at the beach?
(laughter)

2617
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:59.136
MATT: Technically--
TALIESIN: Best vacation ever!

2618
01:42:59.136 --> 01:43:01.050
Please don't break my aunt.

2619
01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:03.560
MATT: You cast Mending as best as you can across

2620
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.100
the pieces, once they're situated in there

2621
01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:07.330
and they all fit together.

2622
01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:11.640
The impact across the chest to side and the waist

2623
01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:14.380
there there's a a triangular crack where it hit

2624
01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:17.700
the impact initially is longer than a foot.

2625
01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:18.533
LAURA: Okay.

2626
01:43:18.533 --> 01:43:22.120
MATT: So those parts are not Mended.

2627
01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.345
LAURA: Okay.

2628
01:43:25.190 --> 01:43:29.530
MATT: So you can fit it together and most of it can clear,

2629
01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:32.890
but there is still a large rift here and a large rift here.

2630
01:43:32.890 --> 01:43:35.900
LAURA: What if we combine the glue with the Mending?

2631
01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:38.380
What if we put some glue and Mend it

2632
01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.370
to where the glue keeps it together fully

2633
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:41.895
and then I Mend it?

2634
01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.090
In, like, as much as I can--

2635
01:43:45.090 --> 01:43:46.470
MATT: This wouldn't be a Mending thing.

2636
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:50.110
This would be hoping the glue is enough to do it for you.

2637
01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:51.380
LAURA: Okay.

2638
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:53.530
MATT: This is the which glue-- this is the--?

2639
01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:56.220
SAM: I mean, that's the other thing.

2640
01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:59.290
Not to be cheap with your dead relatives or anything,

2641
01:43:59.290 --> 01:44:04.290
but this glue is, like, the most powerful glue in existence.

2642
01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:07.220
So if we could maybe

2643
01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:11.010
get some regular glue later

2644
01:44:11.010 --> 01:44:12.140
and try--
TALIESIN: I'm so glad

2645
01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:13.508
I'm not listening to you right now.

2646
01:44:13.508 --> 01:44:15.803
MATT: (laughs)

2647
01:44:15.803 --> 01:44:19.824
LIAM: I could save your work for now.

2648
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:25.170
And we could take them out of here

2649
01:44:25.170 --> 01:44:27.050
and wait till we have everything perfect rather

2650
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:28.700
than risk it.

2651
01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:30.130
MARISHA: Going to shove them in the haversack?

2652
01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.010
Is that what we are doing?

2653
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:32.130
LIAM: No, no, no, no, no.

2654
01:44:32.130 --> 01:44:35.860
Caleb starts placing pieces of amber in a circle

2655
01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:38.220
on the ground and begins to ritually cast

2656
01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:42.780
Widogast's Vault of Amber with the statue.

2657
01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:44.500
I don't have to finish this, but I can

2658
01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:48.040
and they will be safe.
TALIESIN: I'm okay.

2659
01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.060
LAURA: Yeah
TALIESIN: That's-- yeah, we--

2660
01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:52.455
LAURA: Constance, is that all right?

2661
01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:57.423
MATT: "I mean, whatever you think is best."

2662
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.880
Her eyes are still wide, she's still swallowing hard,

2663
01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:06.320
but she's holding strong.

2664
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.525
TALIESIN: Tap. Dad, go talk to Mom.
MATT: "Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right."

2665
01:45:10.525 --> 01:45:12.350
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab Calliope and head over

2666
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:14.430
to the other broken one.
MATT: Okay.

2667
01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:16.050
You head to the other broken piece in the ground,

2668
01:45:16.050 --> 01:45:18.250
you look through it and this one looks to be

2669
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:22.640
a maybe mid-20's or so dragonborn.

2670
01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:26.080
You have no idea the scale coloration,

2671
01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:27.580
as it is still stone.

2672
01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:30.920
They are dressed simply, normal travelers' clothes,

2673
01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.170
a heavy cloak and a sack,

2674
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:36.940
and they are broken into many pieces.

2675
01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.902
TALIESIN: I'm just going to try and gather them up a bit.

2676
01:45:38.902 --> 01:45:39.985
MARISHA: I'm helping.

2677
01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.010
You know this person?

2678
01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:44.908
TALIESIN: No.
MARISHA: Oh.

2679
01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:47.280
TALIESIN: Can't even plant them.

2680
01:45:49.210 --> 01:45:54.205
MARISHA: No, but do you want to, like, keep gathering them?

2681
01:45:54.205 --> 01:45:57.710
I don't know. Should we--?

2682
01:45:57.710 --> 01:45:59.440
TALIESIN: Let's (sighs),

2683
01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.550
let's take everybody who's injured

2684
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:04.137
to the cave

2685
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:09.300
and whoever's feeling strong

2686
01:46:10.770 --> 01:46:14.060
do a walk around and see who else is here.

2687
01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:14.893
Calliope,

2688
01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:19.300
just let's make sure Mom and Dad

2689
01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:21.560
go to the cave with Fjord.

2690
01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:24.790
TRAVIS: Just because we're here and there's

2691
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:27.480
so many different petrified creatures

2692
01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:30.840
I'm going to walk into the water until my head goes under

2693
01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:33.648
the surface and look.

2694
01:46:33.648 --> 01:46:34.853
MATT: For?

2695
01:46:34.853 --> 01:46:35.870
TRAVIS: I'm going to look and see if there are

2696
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:39.590
any other petrified statue things within view.

2697
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:40.640
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

2698
01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.365
TRAVIS: Underwater.

2699
01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.906
10.

2700
01:46:45.906 --> 01:46:47.710
MATT: 10? It's hard to tell.

2701
01:46:47.710 --> 01:46:50.540
It's clear water. I will say, you do see

2702
01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:53.020
a hand sticking up out of the soot maybe

2703
01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:55.560
five feet ahead of you.
TRAVIS: Out of the soot?

2704
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.750
MATT: Yeah.

2705
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:58.580
A stone hand doing that.

2706
01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.470
TRAVIS: I'll walk over to it.

2707
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:03.560
Can I try and clear the soot or the silt around the hand?

2708
01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.900
MATT: Yeah, as you clear it away, the arm goes (boomf)

2709
01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:08.780
as you realize it's just an arm.

2710
01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:10.840
TRAVIS: That's unfortunate.
LAURA: Wait, what?

2711
01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.230
TALIESIN: What? Oh.

2712
01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:15.890
TRAVIS: I just found a piece of an arm underneath the water.

2713
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:18.443
TALIESIN: Bring it up, if you wouldn't mind.

2714
01:47:18.443 --> 01:47:20.570
TRAVIS: (gurgles) No problem. And I'll grab it.

2715
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:23.470
SAM: Okay, so I feel a little guilty.

2716
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:28.210
So Caleb can you give us the pieces back, please?

2717
01:47:28.210 --> 01:47:29.911
I'm going to try this glue.

2718
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:32.710
TALIESIN: Let's wait, we'll wait, we'll wait.

2719
01:47:32.710 --> 01:47:34.000
LAURA: Are you sure?

2720
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.700
LIAM: I also have an idea

2721
01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:41.700
if we can get to Umagorn or--

2722
01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.000
MATT: Uthodurn, you mean?

2723
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.902
LIAM: Uth, his son, what was his son's name?

2724
01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.983
Who reforged the sword for us.

2725
01:47:47.983 --> 01:47:49.908
MATT: Oh, gotcha. I'm sorry, yes.

2726
01:47:49.908 --> 01:47:50.741
LIAM: Did I get his name wrong?

2727
01:47:50.741 --> 01:47:51.880
MATT: No, I think you may have gotten it right.

2728
01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:52.713
I misunderstood.

2729
01:47:52.713 --> 01:47:54.080
SAM: To do what?
LAURA: For what?

2730
01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:57.490
LIAM: If we can pour carefully, which is why I suggest him

2731
01:47:57.490 --> 01:47:58.740
because he is so skilled,

2732
01:48:00.091 --> 01:48:04.830
the correct amount of molten silver into the cracks,

2733
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:07.210
I can turn them to stone.

2734
01:48:07.210 --> 01:48:08.920
SAM: She could pour paint into the cracks

2735
01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:09.950
and turn it into stone.

2736
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:10.950
LIAM: I can not turn paint to stone.

2737
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:12.930
SAM: <i>She</i> can turn paint to stone.

2738
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:14.790
LIAM: Can you paint in stone?

2739
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:18.880
LAURA: Of course I can paint stone-- hmm.

2740
01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.480
The only thing is is I can't paint things connected

2741
01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.672
to each other, so...

2742
01:48:24.810 --> 01:48:26.460
SAM: I could connect them with glue

2743
01:48:28.810 --> 01:48:30.520
I think I can just use some glue.

2744
01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.350
TALIESIN: Don't make any decisions till we get back

2745
01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:36.190
and I'm going to just start walking with Calliope

2746
01:48:36.190 --> 01:48:37.600
and anyone else who cares to join.

2747
01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.134
ASHLEY: I'll follow behind, but give them their space.

2748
01:48:40.134 --> 01:48:43.167
LAURA: I can do another Greater Restoration
if you find somebody.

2749
01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:47.010
MATT: At which point, Cornelius goes,

2750
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.960
"We were-- I was talking with Eremis,

2751
01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.530
"one of the keepers here of the circle.

2752
01:48:55.670 --> 01:48:57.540
"Oh no,"

2753
01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:00.130
and points over and you can see that elf

2754
01:49:00.130 --> 01:49:02.580
that you noticed earlier with the Avandra symbol.

2755
01:49:03.541 --> 01:49:06.190
"I mean, they're probably pretty helpful."

2756
01:49:06.190 --> 01:49:08.340
LAURA: Okay, I'll go over to that person.

2757
01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:11.859
MATT: Okay. Cornelius walks up next to you and goes like,

2758
01:49:11.859 --> 01:49:15.310
"Aw, buddy, I'm so sorry."

2759
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:17.101
Pat, pat, pat.

2760
01:49:17.101 --> 01:49:20.110
LAURA: Pat, pat, pat, Greater Restoration on the head.

2761
01:49:20.110 --> 01:49:21.656
MATT: (laughs)

2762
01:49:21.656 --> 01:49:23.150
LAURA: Wake up now!

2763
01:49:23.150 --> 01:49:25.106
MATT: You watch as the elf slowly...

2764
01:49:25.106 --> 01:49:25.939
"(gasps)

2765
01:49:27.119 --> 01:49:27.952
"Oh.

2766
01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:31.220
"Oh, that's strange.

2767
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:34.600
"What is-- oh no!"

2768
01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:36.872
and looks around at the array.

2769
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:39.961
"This has gotten worse."

2770
01:49:39.961 --> 01:49:41.152
TRAVIS: I found a hand.

2771
01:49:41.152 --> 01:49:42.952
Oh, hello.

2772
01:49:42.952 --> 01:49:44.420
MATT: "Hello."

2773
01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:46.370
TALIESIN: You must be Stone.

2774
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:49.078
MATT: "I'm Eremis Stone, yes.

2775
01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:53.290
"I assume you belong to Clay family?"
LAURA: (laughs)

2776
01:49:53.290 --> 01:49:56.100
That's just really funny.
TALIESIN: Caduceus Clay,

2777
01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.250
at your service.

2778
01:49:58.770 --> 01:50:00.820
MATT: "Glad it seems more of you have made it.

2779
01:50:02.203 --> 01:50:04.050
"Ooh, this is a big mess."

2780
01:50:04.050 --> 01:50:06.280
Looks over at the creature now suspended

2781
01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.410
in the shards of glass, like, reddish dark glass,

2782
01:50:10.410 --> 01:50:13.210
spire piercing out of the ground and holding it aloft

2783
01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:15.818
just bleeding slowly onto the.

2784
01:50:15.818 --> 01:50:17.584
"Oh, well, that is good news.

2785
01:50:17.584 --> 01:50:19.850
"That is great news.

2786
01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:21.400
"Did you do this?"

2787
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:24.850
LIAM: Group effort.
TRAVIS: Yes.

2788
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:26.770
LAURA: But he did the glass part.

2789
01:50:26.770 --> 01:50:29.377
MATT: "That's impressive, truly."

2790
01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:33.530
TRAVIS: What is it?

2791
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:36.260
MATT: "It appears to be some kind of gorgon.

2792
01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:39.655
"I have my theories,

2793
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.629
"but I have a few friends I need to ask questions of.

2794
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:47.200
"They're back in the cave, if you'd come with me."

2795
01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.410
TRAVIS: Are you're sure they're in the cave?

2796
01:50:49.410 --> 01:50:51.452
LIAM: What year is it?

2797
01:50:51.452 --> 01:50:52.285
MATT: "Um.

2798
01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:58.410
"826?"

2799
01:50:58.410 --> 01:51:00.078
LAURA: How far away is that from our year?

2800
01:51:00.078 --> 01:51:01.153
SAM: That's 10 years ago.

2801
01:51:01.153 --> 01:51:02.740
MATT: 10 years ago.
LAURA: Woof!

2802
01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:06.235
LIAM: They might not be in the cave.

2803
01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:11.587
A bit of time has passed since then.

2804
01:51:11.587 --> 01:51:13.228
LAURA: 200 years.

2805
01:51:13.228 --> 01:51:15.790
(laughter)

2806
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:16.812
MATT: Make a deception check.

2807
01:51:16.812 --> 01:51:19.579
(laughter)

2808
01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:22.143
LAURA: 17.

2809
01:51:23.605 --> 01:51:25.760
MATT: "(panicked) Uh!"

2810
01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:28.510
TRAVIS: Jester.
TALIESIN: Don't, don't.

2811
01:51:30.147 --> 01:51:31.664
10, 10ish.

2812
01:51:31.664 --> 01:51:33.814
LAURA: See, it's not as bad now, isn't it?

2813
01:51:33.814 --> 01:51:34.747
Because you thought--

2814
01:51:34.747 --> 01:51:36.908
SAM: She made you feel better!

2815
01:51:36.908 --> 01:51:37.741
(laughter)

2816
01:51:37.741 --> 01:51:39.500
MATT: "Thank you."
LAURA: You're welcome.

2817
01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.250
TALIESIN: Let's-- okay.

2818
01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:43.870
I'll hold, and let's go to the cave.

2819
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:45.620
TRAVIS: There are a few more out here.
MARISHA: You don't want to check the rest?

2820
01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:48.815
TRAVIS: Do you need to see if any of
your compatriots are amongst them?

2821
01:51:48.815 --> 01:51:49.870
MARISHA: We check the rest.

2822
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:52.000
MATT: All right, and as you guys begin to look through,

2823
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.902
you can see Eremis begins to go to a few faces be like,

2824
01:51:57.206 --> 01:51:59.040
"Don't know them.

2825
01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.290
"Don't know them, don't know them.

2826
01:52:02.610 --> 01:52:04.462
"Oh, goodness me," and then recognizes somebody

2827
01:52:04.462 --> 01:52:05.919
and goes up and grabs someone's face goes,

2828
01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:09.450
"This is Darrah." You see this

2829
01:52:09.450 --> 01:52:14.320
really older human woman maybe in her 70s or so.

2830
01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:20.100
Adorned similarly to Eremis and also finds what looks

2831
01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:24.820
to be another large dragonborn figure

2832
01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:29.700
that is wearing a heavy piece of armor and is currently

2833
01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:31.974
with the shield in the front trying to pull back.

2834
01:52:31.974 --> 01:52:36.403
He goes, "Ah, this is Mecatoth."
LAURA: Megatoth!

2835
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:40.720
TALIESIN: Are they also of the Stone?

2836
01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:42.420
MATT: "They are, yes.

2837
01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:44.670
"I don't suppose what you've helped us with

2838
01:52:44.670 --> 01:52:46.880
"you could help them with as well?"

2839
01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:49.865
LAURA: I can once I sleep.
TALIESIN: Not today, but--

2840
01:52:49.865 --> 01:52:51.855
MATT: "All right."
LAURA: (darkly) Not today.

2841
01:52:51.855 --> 01:52:53.920
MATT: "Well, um--"
SAM: (whispered) Not today.

2842
01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:55.440
LAURA: What about all the other people that are here

2843
01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:57.080
that you don't know? We should probably heal them, too.

2844
01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.261
They have lives.
LAURA: "I agree.

2845
01:53:00.261 --> 01:53:01.602
"Look, I--

2846
01:53:03.425 --> 01:53:05.170
"I think Gaima should be able to help.

2847
01:53:05.170 --> 01:53:06.920
"Hopefully, they're back in the cave.

2848
01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:10.200
"We can go ahead and talk to him."

2849
01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:14.070
TALIESIN: Do we see any of my other, on the short run around

2850
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:16.484
the lake, do we see any other family members?
MATT: As you continue to walk,

2851
01:53:16.484 --> 01:53:19.190
you do not see any of your family along the way.

2852
01:53:19.190 --> 01:53:20.657
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine.

2853
01:53:22.295 --> 01:53:25.780
MARISHA: I take the dragonborn head from over here

2854
01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:27.100
that I've been holding around

2855
01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:30.580
and just, like, chuck it in the ocean.
MATT: (splashes)

2856
01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:31.785
TRAVIS: What was that? What'd you throw?

2857
01:53:31.785 --> 01:53:32.978
MARISHA: (noncommittal mumbling) Rock.

2858
01:53:32.978 --> 01:53:34.326
TRAVIS: Oh.

2859
01:53:34.326 --> 01:53:39.270
(laughter)

2860
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:40.820
MATT: Eventually, you guys crest around

2861
01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:43.039
the north side of the oasis.

2862
01:53:43.039 --> 01:53:45.140
(laughter)

2863
01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:47.050
Making your way towards where

2864
01:53:47.050 --> 01:53:51.510
the softer red earth turns into hardened red rock.

2865
01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:56.429
The grass and thick vines

2866
01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:57.595
that have grown over the top of it

2867
01:53:57.595 --> 01:54:01.430
as it pierces outward like a shelf over water,

2868
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:03.450
and beneath it, that the opening into the cavern

2869
01:54:03.450 --> 01:54:07.686
that goes goes darkly into Exandria below.

2870
01:54:07.686 --> 01:54:08.990
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2871
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:13.361
MATT: You step into the cold cavern,
as it continues downward.

2872
01:54:13.361 --> 01:54:14.244
At the outer edge of the pool,

2873
01:54:14.244 --> 01:54:17.037
you can see the bright red rock on the inside

2874
01:54:17.037 --> 01:54:20.860
become smooth, hand-chiseled, as you progress downward.

2875
01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:23.630
Further in, as your eyes adjust,

2876
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:26.990
you pick up dozens of shifting beautiful reflections

2877
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:31.050
as rich, exposed veins of pure gold,

2878
01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:33.980
wind through the walls and reflect the torch light

2879
01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:35.840
that you see Eremis now lighting and holding out

2880
01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.490
to guide you as you head downward.

2881
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:41.813
Along with another statue,

2882
01:54:43.608 --> 01:54:45.050
and another statue.

2883
01:54:47.110 --> 01:54:50.100
Continuing further down, you see the pattern

2884
01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.360
of these veins are, like, this endless splintering

2885
01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:54.773
lightning bolt of shining dawn that just carved through

2886
01:54:54.773 --> 01:54:59.087
the rock on all sides and above. It's beautiful.

2887
01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:04.010
Contrasted with the horror of seeing more and more

2888
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:08.000
of visitors or the Stone family themselves,

2889
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:11.810
encased in these moments of terror.

2890
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:17.880
LAURA: So we took this guy out, and nobody else could.

2891
01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:19.580
That's pretty impressive, you guys.

2892
01:55:21.689 --> 01:55:23.545
TRAVIS: That's pretty good. (coughs)

2893
01:55:23.545 --> 01:55:24.945
SAM: Oh.
LIAM: We work well together.

2894
01:55:24.945 --> 01:55:29.045
SAM: You okay there, Fjord Stone? You're okay?
TRAVIS: Yep. Doing all right.

2895
01:55:29.045 --> 01:55:32.300
LAURA: We need to take a rest.
Fjord is looking really rough.

2896
01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:35.960
MATT: The hall widens now into a domed, oval-shaped cavern

2897
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:39.640
of ruddy rock formations splattered
with the same gold veins.

2898
01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.110
Numerous small huts and structures of humble stone

2899
01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:44.470
and dried thatch mark the perimeter

2900
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:46.090
of the inside of this cave.

2901
01:55:46.090 --> 01:55:48.360
The center of the large base

2902
01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:53.360
is home to a formidable, multi-part
shrine of rising pillars,

2903
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:57.660
arches and beautiful temple structures that house

2904
01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:59.290
the Stone family and the interior

2905
01:55:59.290 --> 01:56:02.040
of the Cave of Remembrance.

2906
01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.530
You can see social spaces for worship and work

2907
01:56:05.530 --> 01:56:07.546
and you can see the many denizens,

2908
01:56:07.546 --> 01:56:09.504
all frozen

2909
01:56:09.504 --> 01:56:11.112
in stone.

2910
01:56:11.112 --> 01:56:12.412
And that's where we'll take our break.

2911
01:56:12.412 --> 01:56:13.712
(groaning)

2912
01:56:13.712 --> 01:56:15.997
TRAVIS: Shit.

2913
01:56:15.997 --> 01:56:18.522
LAURA: The gorgon just ran in and--

2914
01:56:18.522 --> 01:56:20.113
TRAVIS: One bull!
LAURA: -- ran around,

2915
01:56:20.113 --> 01:56:22.370
or do you think something else did it?

2916
01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:24.370
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see, but I have a theory

2917
01:56:24.370 --> 01:56:28.740
and my theory is this was a
burial that went wrong. But we'll see.

2918
01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:30.369
TRAVIS: A burial that went wrong?

2919
01:56:30.369 --> 01:56:31.860
TALIESIN: Maybe a burial that went wrong.

2920
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:32.693
LAURA: They are stone.

2921
01:56:32.693 --> 01:56:35.368
LIAM: But they're mostly regular folk,
probably, so, you know,

2922
01:56:35.368 --> 01:56:37.542
can't handle a big magic bull.

2923
01:56:37.542 --> 01:56:38.881
TALIESIN: Just a theory.

2924
01:56:38.881 --> 01:56:40.680
MARISHA: That's a lot for one bull.

2925
01:56:42.072 --> 01:56:44.010
MATT: It was over a period of time, too.

2926
01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:44.843
LAURA: That's true.

2927
01:56:44.843 --> 01:56:46.676
TRAVIS: 10 fucking years.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2928
01:56:46.676 --> 01:56:47.917
TRAVIS: Ooh! That'll getcha!

2929
01:56:47.917 --> 01:56:50.565
That's some Flight of the Navigator shit right there.

2930
01:56:50.565 --> 01:56:52.866
MATT: A lot of pilgrims coming in and realizing too late.

2931
01:56:52.866 --> 01:56:53.807
TRAVIS: No?

2932
01:56:53.807 --> 01:56:55.751
SAM: I love that movie.
MATT: Compliance.

2933
01:56:55.751 --> 01:56:57.800
(laughter)

2934
01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:59.010
We'll back here shortly, we'll pick up

2935
01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:00.300
the latter half of this session here, guys.

2936
01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:03.730
In the meantime, we do have
our Wyrmwood giveaway for tonight.

2937
01:57:03.730 --> 01:57:06.313
The cherry dice vault from our friends at Wyrmwood.

2938
01:57:06.313 --> 01:57:07.993
TRAVIS: It's so lovely.
MATT: It smells so nice.

2939
01:57:07.993 --> 01:57:08.834
It looks nice.

2940
01:57:08.834 --> 01:57:10.713
LAURA: It's beautiful.
MATT: It is.

2941
01:57:10.713 --> 01:57:13.500
One lucky winner in the chat will win this piece.

2942
01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.583
Tonight's keyword is Oasis.

2943
01:57:15.583 --> 01:57:17.142
TRAVIS: Oasis.

2944
01:57:17.142 --> 01:57:19.430
MATT: O-A-S-I-S. Put it into the chat room

2945
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:21.900
once and only once. More than once will be disqualified

2946
01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:24.350
and once again, giveaway rules for people in the US

2947
01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:27.220
and Canada only, excluding Quebec.

2948
01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:32.220
Because of stupid laws and we'll be back here shortly.

2949
01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:33.094
We'll see you guys a little bit.

2950
01:57:33.094 --> 01:57:35.296

2951
01:57:35.296 --> 01:57:36.509

2973
01:58:33.090 --> 01:58:35.525
Two Point Hospital's coming to console.

2974
01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:39.427
Build your breathtaking hospital.

2975
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.017
Cure unusual illnesses.

2976
01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:49.548
What happened to that guy?

2977
01:58:52.246 --> 01:58:54.960
Improve your hospitals with research,

2978
01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:58.770
new machines, and by hiring great staff.

2979
01:58:58.770 --> 01:59:01.550
Oh, and try not to kill anyone.

2980
01:59:03.807 --> 01:59:05.265
(groans)

2981
01:59:09.574 --> 01:59:13.424
(ocean waves gently crashing)

2982
01:59:14.397 --> 01:59:15.826
(electronic binging)

2983
01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.776
LIAM: We're talking about ghosts today,
ladies and gentlemen.

2984
01:59:19.776 --> 01:59:20.840
SAM: We are talking about ghosts.

2985
01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:21.673
Ghost.

2986
01:59:21.673 --> 01:59:23.197
BRIDGET: Ghost.
LIAM: Otherwordly.

2987
01:59:23.197 --> 01:59:24.128
Ghost.

2988
01:59:24.128 --> 01:59:25.043
Ghost. Ghost.
LIAM: Ghost.

2989
01:59:25.043 --> 01:59:25.876
SAM: Ghost. Ghost.

2990
01:59:25.876 --> 01:59:27.711
LIAM: Forget ghosts because this is the real--

2991
01:59:27.711 --> 01:59:28.544
LAURA: Ghost.
BRIDGET: There is--

2992
01:59:28.544 --> 01:59:30.185
LIAM: Ghosts, they can smell ghosts.
SAM: Ghost.

2993
01:59:30.185 --> 01:59:31.238
Ghost. Ghosts.
BRIDGET: Ghost.

2994
01:59:31.238 --> 01:59:32.793

2995
01:59:32.793 --> 01:59:33.626
LIAM: Ghost.
DAVID: Ghost.

2996
01:59:33.626 --> 01:59:34.900
SAM: Lionel Richie's pre-ghost.

2997
01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:35.740
SAM: Ghosts?
BRIDGET: Yes.

2998
01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:36.688

LAURA and LIAM: Ghosts.
DAVID: That's a ghost.

3001
01:59:39.482 --> 01:59:41.502
That's a ghost, that's a ghost.

3002
01:59:41.502 --> 01:59:42.335
There's a ghost.

3003
01:59:42.335 --> 01:59:44.217
There's a ghost.
BRIDGET: Should I move, or should I stay?

3004
01:59:44.217 --> 01:59:45.175
DAVID: No.
LIAM: Ghosts.

3005
01:59:45.175 --> 01:59:46.008
SAM: Ghosts.

3006
01:59:46.008 --> 01:59:47.448
Ghosts don't like complete sentences.

3007
01:59:47.448 --> 01:59:48.297
SAM: Ghost.
LIAM: Ghost.

3008
01:59:48.297 --> 01:59:49.137
Ghost. Ghost.

3009
01:59:49.137 --> 01:59:51.500
(creepy noises) Yum yum!

3010
01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:52.945
SAM: Ghost cigarettes.

3011
01:59:52.945 --> 01:59:55.929
(screams)

3012
01:59:55.929 --> 01:59:57.410
Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts, ghosts.

3013
01:59:57.410 --> 01:59:58.418
SAM: What do I do?
BRIDGET: Ghost.

3014
01:59:58.418 --> 01:59:59.404
LAURA: Ghost.
LIAM: Ghost.

3015
01:59:59.404 --> 02:00:02.404
Ooh!
BRIDGET: You ran right through it!

3016
02:00:02.404 --> 02:00:04.785
SAM: I killed a ghost?
BRIDGET: You killed the ghost.

3017
02:00:04.785 --> 02:00:06.118
SAM: Is he still there? I killed a ghost.

3018
02:00:06.118 --> 02:00:08.701
(upbeat guitar music)

3019
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:19.200
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

3020
02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.980
BRIAN: I have some wine for you, sir.

3021
02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:22.350
MATT: Well, thank you, I'm excited.

3022
02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:25.510
BRIAN: See how easy that was.
MATT: That's was very easy.

3023
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:28.160
BRIAN: I had Jerry pre-cork it.

3024
02:00:29.093 --> 02:00:29.926
DANI: What?
MATT: (laughs)

3025
02:00:29.926 --> 02:00:31.830
Don't ever wink at me again.

3026
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:33.910
BRIAN: I didn't wink at you, I winked at the folks at home.

3027
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:35.480
MATT: I was in the splash zone.

3028
02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:37.330
BRIAN: Oh, man.

3029
02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:38.790
In the splash zone.
MATT: That's good. That's a lot.

3030
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:40.420
That's, holy, stop!

3031
02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:41.756
BRIAN: We have a lot to talk about.

3032
02:00:41.756 --> 02:00:44.110
I want to get to the truth.

3033
02:00:44.110 --> 02:00:46.841
"What, if any, were your expectations

3034
02:00:46.841 --> 02:00:50.130
"for the hag encounter and what the Mighty Nein

3035
02:00:50.130 --> 02:00:51.640
"would be willing to offer?

3036
02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:54.500
"Laura's stunts aside, were you surprised by any

3037
02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:57.172
"of their responses to her?"

3038
02:00:57.172 --> 02:00:59.507
MATT: I was kind of surprised by

3039
02:00:59.507 --> 02:01:04.507
Nott's immediate considering

3040
02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:07.766
of furthering the war.

3041
02:01:07.766 --> 02:01:11.000
BRIAN: Yes, I was, too. Yeah.
MATT: I was like, "Oh! Huh."

3042
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.660
That's a unique-- it's one of those things

3043
02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:14.160
where catches you off guard and you're like,

3044
02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:18.180
"Oh, okay, all right."
BRIAN: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

3045
02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:21.480
MATT: Beau, you know, knowing where Beau's arc has gone

3046
02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:24.020
and where her mind was at that time,

3047
02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:27.003
it was really interesting to have her be willing

3048
02:01:28.692 --> 02:01:30.300
to give up the things that were important to her,

3049
02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:33.300
based on her sense of self esteem and the--

3050
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:35.460
you know, where she was mentally sitting

3051
02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:37.290
at that time, worried that it could not possibly

3052
02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:39.270
get better than this and that

3053
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:42.055
peaked early-type mentality. I wasn't expecting it.

3054
02:01:42.055 --> 02:01:43.350
It's all those things were when it happens,

3055
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:44.420
you're like, "Oh, shit,"

3056
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:46.440
and then you think about it after you're like,

3057
02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:47.990
"I see where--"
BRIAN: Yeah.

3058
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.950
MATT: "-- threads and thoughts went there,"

3059
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:50.880
and it was it was very fascinating.

3060
02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:52.890
BRIAN: "At the start of the campaign, everyone talked

3061
02:01:52.890 --> 02:01:55.820
"about generally trying to keep the two campaigns separate.

3062
02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:58.340
"Did you hesitate to let Laura play a cleric

3063
02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:02.180
"of a significant Campaign 1 NPC, or did this slow burn

3064
02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:04.670
"on the reveal and change in his situation

3065
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:07.335
"make it different enough to be fair game?"

3066
02:02:07.335 --> 02:02:09.340
MATT: When I wanted to keep the campaigns separate,

3067
02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:12.660
it was less about, like, no connections whatsoever.

3068
02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:15.200
It was more about... I didn't want them to play, like,

3069
02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:17.040
the children of Vox Machina.

3070
02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:18.530
I didn't want it to lean so heavily

3071
02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:20.060
into the previous story and their characters

3072
02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:24.630
that it was a very visual continuation

3073
02:02:24.630 --> 02:02:25.463
of the previous story.

3074
02:02:25.463 --> 02:02:26.550
I wanted to be something that was unique

3075
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:28.550
and special to its own narrative.

3076
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:31.260
When she brought up wanting to bring Artagan

3077
02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:34.290
into her character, I felt that was a distant enough

3078
02:02:34.290 --> 02:02:36.790
and only situationally attached element

3079
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:38.770
to the previous campaign and the way

3080
02:02:38.770 --> 02:02:40.190
it would be involved in this story would

3081
02:02:40.190 --> 02:02:43.184
have really nothing to do with Vox Machina

3082
02:02:43.184 --> 02:02:45.480
beyond the inciting incident

3083
02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:47.837
of his freedom from the Feywild.

3084
02:02:47.837 --> 02:02:48.930
It was enough of a thing where I was like,

3085
02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:53.220
This, yeah, this won't directly tie Vox Machina

3086
02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:56.140
into their narrative where they are now intrinsically bound

3087
02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:59.040
and it just becomes a continuation of Vox Machina's story.

3088
02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.890
It's a choice that they made, it's an action they took

3089
02:03:01.890 --> 02:03:04.370
and beyond that, it is its own unique story

3090
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:06.030
that is more Jester's story.

3091
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:09.180
BRIAN: "Even when following an
individual character's plot threads,

3092
02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:12.150
"you and the cast seem to hit on development beats

3093
02:03:12.150 --> 02:03:15.770
"for other characters, such as the Artagan reveal

3094
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:19.700
"to Jester while going to the Menagerie for Clay.

3095
02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:22.210
"Is this a conscious and purposeful effort on your part,

3096
02:03:22.210 --> 02:03:25.040
"does it develop naturally, or is it a mix?"

3097
02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:28.020
MATT: I think what would be an interesting path

3098
02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:31.772
for this NPC to go, whether or not the players get involved?

3099
02:03:31.772 --> 02:03:33.160
I don't want to leave it.

3100
02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:34.360
I don't want it to be that everything

3101
02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:36.050
is directly based on the players' choices.

3102
02:03:36.050 --> 02:03:37.710
The world continues whether

3103
02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:38.920
or not they interact with elements.

3104
02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:41.810
So I loosely have ideas of, like, it'd be fun

3105
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:43.150
if it this way or, like, it makes sense

3106
02:03:43.150 --> 02:03:44.220
that this would happen.

3107
02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:45.650
BRIAN: It's like when you said the war is going to happen,

3108
02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:46.990
whether they involved or not.

3109
02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:49.730
MATT: Yeah, and I honestly expected
them to not get as involved.

3110
02:03:49.730 --> 02:03:53.725
I thought when the beacon fell in their lap originally,

3111
02:03:53.725 --> 02:03:54.920
and they gave it away, I was like,

3112
02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:56.110
"Okay, well, that thread's done."

3113
02:03:56.110 --> 02:03:57.540
BRIAN: Yep.
MATT: Or when they got

3114
02:03:57.540 --> 02:03:58.970
the beacon back, I was like, "They'll probably

3115
02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:01.940
"be keeping this out of the hands of anyone in the war."

3116
02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:05.190
And, honestly, when Yeza was captured,

3117
02:04:05.190 --> 02:04:09.100
I thought it was going to be a "Let's look into our allies

3118
02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:11.658
"in the Dwendalian Empire and see who we can,

3119
02:04:11.658 --> 02:04:13.950
"you know, help us figure out how to get Yeza back."

3120
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:16.539
I had this whole thing planned out with, like,

3121
02:04:16.539 --> 02:04:18.610
them getting more involved in the Dwendalian Empire

3122
02:04:18.610 --> 02:04:20.520
and their their political structure there

3123
02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:23.803
and trying to lean into that side and-- nope, you know.

3124
02:04:23.803 --> 02:04:24.661
BRIAN: Yep.

3125
02:04:24.661 --> 02:04:26.170
MATT: But that's how it works out.

3126
02:04:26.170 --> 02:04:29.760
I don't plan because I don't want to push the players

3127
02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.930
in particular direction, but as

3128
02:04:31.930 --> 02:04:34.480
DM, game master knows, to a certain extent, you try

3129
02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:37.600
and think of a few possible loose assumptions

3130
02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.060
and plan a little bit around those

3131
02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:40.950
so you don't feel completely flat footed.

3132
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:43.600
BRIAN: "Taking the large families of Taliesin's characters

3133
02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:46.219
"and making them suffer is a recurring theme."

3134
02:04:46.219 --> 02:04:47.980
(laughter)

3135
02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:51.797
"How long has the idea of them being turned

3136
02:04:51.797 --> 02:04:53.960
"to stone been in your plans?"

3137
02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:57.820
MATT: Look, I work with what I've been given.

3138
02:04:57.820 --> 02:04:58.861
BRIAN: I understand.

3139
02:04:58.861 --> 02:05:00.577
MATT: When your party of characters

3140
02:05:00.577 --> 02:05:04.370
hands you largely tragic backstories,

3141
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:06.645
revolving around their parents,

3142
02:05:06.645 --> 02:05:09.000
I'm not going to deny that.

3143
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.700
I just have to find a creative way
to bring it into the narrative

3144
02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:14.570
that hasn't been explored in other stories we've done.

3145
02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:19.690
Travis, not Travis, I'm sorry, Taliesin gave me

3146
02:05:19.690 --> 02:05:21.880
his Caduceus' background about a family

3147
02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:24.253
that, piece by piece, left off and never came back.

3148
02:05:24.253 --> 02:05:25.353
BRIAN: Yeah.

3149
02:05:25.353 --> 02:05:28.030
MATT: Well, there's a few ways I could go with that

3150
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:29.960
on multiple different scales of tragic.

3151
02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:33.330
I figured this one was thematically one

3152
02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:35.840
of the lesser tragic, weirdly.

3153
02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:36.681
BRIAN: Yeah.

3154
02:05:38.262 --> 02:05:39.095
MATT: And...

3155
02:05:40.578 --> 02:05:41.930
for me, it was just trying to come up

3156
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:43.860
with a narrative reason that makes sense

3157
02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.800
as to why they would never have returned,

3158
02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:49.225
but was more

3159
02:05:49.225 --> 02:05:51.990
complicated than just "they died."
BRIAN: Yeah.

3160
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:53.090
MATT: "They didn't survive."

3161
02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:58.370
To me, that doesn't-- that's not interesting.

3162
02:05:58.370 --> 02:06:00.188
BRIAN: Creepy ain't a crime.

3163
02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:04.569
But this fucking outfit is.
DANI: Yes.

3164
02:06:04.569 --> 02:06:05.402
(laughter)

3165
02:06:05.402 --> 02:06:07.450
BRIAN: I hate looking at it in the monitor.

3166
02:06:07.450 --> 02:06:08.774
I feel terrible.

3167
02:06:08.774 --> 02:06:10.780
DANI: It's so bright.
MATT: You should.

3168
02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:12.546
BRIAN: I feel like Drew Hefner.

3169
02:06:12.546 --> 02:06:14.300
(laughter)

3170
02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.410
His douchey nephew he never wanted.

3171
02:06:16.410 --> 02:06:18.173
MATT: Checks out, yeah. Yep.
BRIAN: You know what I mean.

3172
02:06:18.173 --> 02:06:20.230
He's like, "Ah, my fucking sister's kid's here again

3173
02:06:20.230 --> 02:06:21.701
"wearing my goddamn robe."

3174
02:06:21.701 --> 02:06:23.300
(laughter)

3175
02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:28.298
LIAM: Subscribe or don't subscribe.

3176
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:32.050
That's not a question.

3177
02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:37.490
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to ponder the pros

3178
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:40.917
and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime.

3179
02:06:42.170 --> 02:06:45.200
Or to take hands and gift new subs to Critters

3180
02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.450
who find they can't afford them.

3181
02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.598
To play.

3182
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.166
To sleep.

3183
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:57.038
No more.

3184
02:06:58.550 --> 02:07:01.110
And by a sleep to say that cast and crew

3185
02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:03.390
of Crit'cal Role might find their naps around

3186
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:06.410
the hectic schedule of a live broadcast

3187
02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:08.880
that we have brought for your consumption,

3188
02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:11.813
both Critter and fan alike.

3189
02:07:14.150 --> 02:07:17.582
To play, or sleep.

3190
02:07:18.693 --> 02:07:19.526
(scoffs)

3191
02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:22.610
No sleep.

3192
02:07:22.610 --> 02:07:24.723
But just to stream.

3193
02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:28.103
Aye, there's the rub.

3194
02:07:28.978 --> 02:07:33.908
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

3195
02:07:37.603 --> 02:07:40.300
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tagline.

3196
02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:41.666
Do we got that?

3197
02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:44.503
That is Twitch poetry.

3198
02:07:45.764 --> 02:07:47.210
(grunting)

3199
02:07:47.210 --> 02:07:51.210
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

3200
02:07:51.210 --> 02:07:54.860
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe, gift some subscriptions.

3201
02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:57.280
You-- You got it.

3202
02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:05.368
Wrong soliloquy for the skull, but that's fucking good.

3203
02:08:05.368 --> 02:08:10.368
(upbeat string chamber music)

3204
02:08:11.246 --> 02:08:13.888
(dramatic orchestral music)

3205
02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:10.700
MATT: Welcome back.

3206
02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:13.150
Go with the simple classic, Sam, I liked it.

3207
02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:17.500
First, we have a winner, as picked during our break.

3208
02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:20.210
The winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway is

3209
02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:21.970
Cookie2259.

3210
02:21:21.970 --> 02:21:23.435
TRAVIS: Cookie2259.

3211
02:21:23.435 --> 02:21:25.480
MATT: Cookie2259, congratulations.

3212
02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:29.253
We'll get that dice vault sent to you ASAP.

3213
02:21:29.253 --> 02:21:31.480
(laughter)

3214
02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:33.090
TRAVIS: [inaudible]
MARISHA: [inaudible]

3215
02:21:33.090 --> 02:21:34.250
TALIESIN: Fine art.

3216
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:39.090
MATT: So you all enter

3217
02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:40.955
the interior of the cave.

3218
02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:47.170
You look around at the faint pieces

3219
02:21:47.170 --> 02:21:50.160
of glowing crystal that alight the interior.

3220
02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:53.170
There are pools of water beneath a lot of these

3221
02:21:53.170 --> 02:21:56.040
that cause the reflecting shimmer

3222
02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:59.010
that dances across the cavern walls and catches elements

3223
02:21:59.010 --> 02:22:01.700
of the gold veins that swirl and swarm

3224
02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:03.935
throughout the red rock.

3225
02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:08.365
It's beautiful, it's serene, and it is silent.

3226
02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:11.532
You can see Eremis looking around,

3227
02:22:11.532 --> 02:22:13.643
a sorrowful look on his face.

3228
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:17.763
"I guess things have indeed changed.

3229
02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:24.322
"Let me see, I might be able to...

3230
02:22:24.322 --> 02:22:26.410
"(sighs)

3231
02:22:26.410 --> 02:22:29.550
"I don't know how long things have been.

3232
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:31.324
"Who and when.

3233
02:22:31.324 --> 02:22:33.045
"Do you know how long it's been like this?"

3234
02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:36.000
TALIESIN: I don't.

3235
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.383
LAURA: How long have your parents been gone?

3236
02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:41.720
TALIESIN: I don't know, it was--

3237
02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:46.440
It was quite a while when the...

3238
02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:51.860
When they first left, I don't know when you arrived.

3239
02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:53.130
When did you arrive?

3240
02:22:53.130 --> 02:22:54.338
What did you?

3241
02:22:54.338 --> 02:22:57.713
MATT: Cornelius goes, "Uh, I mean,

3242
02:22:57.713 --> 02:22:59.438
"I don't really know how long

3243
02:22:59.438 --> 02:23:01.170
"I've been here, either, if we're going to

3244
02:23:01.170 --> 02:23:02.628
"be really honest about it."

3245
02:23:02.628 --> 02:23:05.944
LAURA: What year did you get here, do you think?

3246
02:23:05.944 --> 02:23:07.252
MATT: "Uh.

3247
02:23:08.822 --> 02:23:09.888
"I'm really--"
TALIESIN: That's

3248
02:23:09.888 --> 02:23:11.648
a rough question for us, to be fair,

3249
02:23:11.648 --> 02:23:14.749
we're not really calendar people.
MATT: "Yeah."

3250
02:23:14.749 --> 02:23:15.615
TRAVIS: When was the last time you--

3251
02:23:15.615 --> 02:23:18.490
MATT: "Constance, what year--?" And she goes,

3252
02:23:18.490 --> 02:23:23.098
"Well, me and my sister left, I think it would have been...

3253
02:23:23.970 --> 02:23:28.570
"827."

3254
02:23:28.570 --> 02:23:29.650
MARISHA: So before.

3255
02:23:29.650 --> 02:23:30.980
SAM: That was nine years ago.

3256
02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:34.150
LAURA: How long did it take you to get here?

3257
02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:37.260
MATT: "Quite a few months.

3258
02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:43.080
"Me and Corrin," she gets a little soft for a moment,

3259
02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:46.760
"Me and Corrin--"
TALIESIN: They were the first to leave.

3260
02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:51.760
MATT: "We made our way to meet with the Dusts

3261
02:23:52.504 --> 02:23:54.162
"and

3262
02:23:56.151 --> 02:23:58.380
"didn't meet with much success there.

3263
02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:00.130
"We thought maybe we would encounter

3264
02:24:01.148 --> 02:24:04.270
"this glass that was asked of us,

3265
02:24:04.270 --> 02:24:06.890
"perhaps it's in this location.

3266
02:24:08.470 --> 02:24:12.090
"But upon arrival, found that this creature

3267
02:24:12.090 --> 02:24:16.200
"had already ravaged the outside of this cave

3268
02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:19.800
"and, well, then we ran into you.

3269
02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:23.480
"<i>I</i> ran into you."

3270
02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:26.160
LAURA: We're going to heal her, okay?

3271
02:24:29.010 --> 02:24:30.693
TALIESIN: We will do what we can.

3272
02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:32.733
We're--

3273
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:35.703
We're stalwart.

3274
02:24:36.930 --> 02:24:39.030
We'll be fine, whatever happens.

3275
02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:44.420
MATT: "Loss is not an unfamiliar concept to our family,

3276
02:24:44.420 --> 02:24:49.415
"but I appreciate you extending your empathy."

3277
02:24:53.470 --> 02:24:55.710
TALIESIN: I met the Dusts.

3278
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:56.543
MATT: "Did you?"

3279
02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:01.275
TALIESIN: I'm going to take out the crystals.

3280
02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:05.437
It's been a long time.

3281
02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:09.150
MATT: You can see her step forward
and Cornelius steps forward

3282
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:11.030
and they both put their hands under yours

3283
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:13.600
and Calliope approaches to look at them,

3284
02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:15.570
but still has her hand on her side.

3285
02:25:16.946 --> 02:25:20.820
(as Cornelius) "Wow, I'm very impressed,

3286
02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:25.840
"Caduceus. This is, I mean,"

3287
02:25:28.430 --> 02:25:29.540
and he reaches in his pocket

3288
02:25:29.540 --> 02:25:32.671
and pulls out all these shards of green glass,

3289
02:25:32.671 --> 02:25:36.590
and he was like, "I think I got confused."

3290
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.860
TALIESIN: Me too, a couple times.
MATT: "Aw."

3291
02:25:44.210 --> 02:25:45.360
TALIESIN: Honestly, I thought Calliope

3292
02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:46.860
was going to be the one to do it.

3293
02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:51.620
MATT: Calliope reaches in her pocket and pulls out a piece

3294
02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:54.113
of similar crystal.
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

3295
02:25:58.450 --> 02:26:00.890
MATT: (as Calliope) "I would have beaten you,
brother, I'm just saying.

3296
02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:03.386
TALIESIN: Would you've?

3297
02:26:06.962 --> 02:26:09.340
MATT: "It would have been very close."

3298
02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:10.531
TALIESIN: Maybe.

3299
02:26:10.531 --> 02:26:12.472
MARISHA: Did you also get that at the Dusts'?

3300
02:26:12.472 --> 02:26:13.305
MATT: "I did."

3301
02:26:14.350 --> 02:26:17.492
MARISHA: Oh. Good for you.

3302
02:26:17.492 --> 02:26:19.442
MATT: "Thank you. What's your name?"

3303
02:26:19.442 --> 02:26:22.384
MARISHA: Oh, I'm Beauregard. I'm not important.

3304
02:26:23.675 --> 02:26:25.125
MATT: "Very well."

3305
02:26:25.983 --> 02:26:28.050
ASHLEY: I'm Yasha, I'm <i>very</i> important.

3306
02:26:28.050 --> 02:26:29.640
TALIESIN: It's true.
ASHLEY: Just kidding.

3307
02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:31.360
TRAVIS: Get it. Go, girl.
MATT: "Very well."

3308
02:26:33.468 --> 02:26:34.955
SAM: Snatched.

3309
02:26:34.955 --> 02:26:37.378
MATT: "Calliope. Calliope Clay."

3310
02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:41.480
(as Cornelius) "Actually, I don't think
we've done a full introduction

3311
02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:44.240
"of your friends here, if you want to..."

3312
02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:49.210
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, wow.

3313
02:26:49.210 --> 02:26:52.457
SAM: We can do it for you.
TALIESIN: Everybody, please go ahead.

3314
02:26:54.351 --> 02:26:57.638
LAURA: Jester, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

3315
02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:03.300
SAM: Hi, I'm Nott. We've been hanging with your son

3316
02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:06.210
and he's really great.

3317
02:27:06.210 --> 02:27:08.230
LAURA: Super, super, super powerful.

3318
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:11.410
MATT: And, like, nudges Constance by the side

3319
02:27:11.410 --> 02:27:13.680
and she gives, like, a knowing look.

3320
02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:15.220
LIAM: Yeah, you have raised him well.

3321
02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:18.370
My name is Caleb Widogast, hello.

3322
02:27:19.970 --> 02:27:21.820
MATT: "And Beauregard, you already said, so."

3323
02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:25.950
MARISHA: Expositor with Cobalt Reserve.

3324
02:27:25.950 --> 02:27:27.589
MATT: "I have no idea what that means."

3325
02:27:27.589 --> 02:27:29.647
MARISHA: Yeah, that checks.

3326
02:27:29.647 --> 02:27:30.980
MATT: "Sounds really nice, though."

3327
02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:32.567
LIAM: Not important, though.

3328
02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:35.940
MATT: "Okay, and you are--"

3329
02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:39.448
TRAVIS: Fjord... Stone. No relation.

3330
02:27:39.448 --> 02:27:41.264
Your son has been a great friend.

3331
02:27:41.264 --> 02:27:43.770
MARISHA: He's totally related.
TRAVIS: I'm not.

3332
02:27:43.770 --> 02:27:45.596
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: No, this is Nott.

3333
02:27:45.596 --> 02:27:47.620
SAM: No, but he is a Stone.

3334
02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:51.330
I think he might be related.
LAURA: Stone cold fox!

3335
02:27:51.330 --> 02:27:53.060
TRAVIS: Not Stone.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3336
02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:54.543
And--
MARISHA: "So you're Nott Stone."

3337
02:27:54.543 --> 02:27:57.183
SAM: I'm not Stone.
MATT: "You're not a Stone."

3338
02:27:57.183 --> 02:27:59.066
TRAVIS: You're Nott the Brave.
MARISHA: He is a Stone.

3339
02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:01.725
And I'm not important.
LIAM: Hold on, hold on.

3340
02:28:01.725 --> 02:28:03.290
MARISHA: She's Nott the Brave.
SAM: Third base.

3341
02:28:03.290 --> 02:28:04.514
LIAM: Restart.

3342
02:28:04.514 --> 02:28:06.120
(laughter)

3343
02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:07.830
TALIESIN: How has this never happened before?

3344
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:09.003
(laughter)

3345
02:28:09.003 --> 02:28:10.510
MATT: A mild nosebleed appears.

3346
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:13.360
(laughter)
TRAVIS: (explosion) Ah!

3347
02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:15.423
(laughter)

3348
02:28:15.423 --> 02:28:18.400
MARISHA: He was a Dust after all!

3349
02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:21.010
TALIESIN: Fjord is a recent child

3350
02:28:21.010 --> 02:28:23.330
of the Wild-Mother as well.

3351
02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:25.340
MATT: Eremis steps forward.

3352
02:28:26.860 --> 02:28:29.908
"Interesting, of the Wild-Mother and your name is Stone."

3353
02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:32.570
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah.

3354
02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.370
He could have been a child of the Traveler,

3355
02:28:34.370 --> 02:28:37.450
but he chose the Wild-Mother, so it's got to mean something.

3356
02:28:37.450 --> 02:28:39.970
SAM: There's the Stone part.

3357
02:28:39.970 --> 02:28:41.389
LAURA: What?

3358
02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:44.190
(laughter)

3359
02:28:44.190 --> 02:28:45.023
TRAVIS: Yes.

3360
02:28:45.968 --> 02:28:47.868
MATT: "Have you been through here before, then?"

3361
02:28:49.650 --> 02:28:51.030
TRAVIS: Here, the Menagerie?

3362
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:52.263
MATT: "Mm-hmm."
TRAVIS: No, no,

3363
02:28:52.263 --> 02:28:55.310
it's my first time, same for most of us.

3364
02:28:55.310 --> 02:28:57.280
LAURA: But the he is from the Menagerie Coast.

3365
02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:59.250
What, another coincidence?!

3366
02:28:59.250 --> 02:29:01.980
TRAVIS: Port Damali, not really, I mean, yes.

3367
02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:04.960
MARISHA: In the Menagerie Coast, though.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3368
02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:09.110
SAM: He also has memory gaps.
TRAVIS: Not true.

3369
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:11.650
SAM: Well, do you remember being born?

3370
02:29:12.703 --> 02:29:15.286
LIAM: Nott, that's true.
TRAVIS: No, I can't.

3371
02:29:17.366 --> 02:29:19.758
MATT: Cornelius looks towards you and goes,

3372
02:29:19.758 --> 02:29:23.245
"I-- You've made some friends."

3373
02:29:23.245 --> 02:29:25.380
TALIESIN: I'm aware, it's a lot.

3374
02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:26.214
LAURA: Hey.
MATT: "Thank you.

3375
02:29:26.214 --> 02:29:27.728
"Thank you all for--"

3376
02:29:27.728 --> 02:29:30.840
LAURA: But we killed the thing and we brought you back

3377
02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:35.413
from being a statue, so we are something.

3378
02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:37.320
MATT: "That is very true."

3379
02:29:38.843 --> 02:29:42.108
MARISHA: Eremis, what's with the statues,

3380
02:29:42.108 --> 02:29:44.913
what's with this--
MATT: He's looking around and goes,

3381
02:29:46.470 --> 02:29:48.470
"I'm looking to see if I can find Gaima

3382
02:29:50.470 --> 02:29:51.530
"if she's still here."

3383
02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:56.890
And he walks off towards the large central structure

3384
02:29:56.890 --> 02:30:00.470
with the large stone arches where the majority

3385
02:30:00.470 --> 02:30:02.411
of the refracting--

3386
02:30:02.411 --> 02:30:04.430
I just need to watch this happen right now.

3387
02:30:04.430 --> 02:30:06.240
SAM: Wow, she made a cupcake sandwich!

3388
02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:08.600
I don't know that I've seen you do that before.

3389
02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:10.994
MARISHA: Oh my god, you did. I'm so jealous.

3390
02:30:10.994 --> 02:30:12.586
ASHLEY: That smells so good.
LAURA: That's how you do it

3391
02:30:12.586 --> 02:30:13.999
without getting the icing all over your mouth.

3392
02:30:13.999 --> 02:30:15.701
SAM: I didn't know that was a thing.
ASHLEY: That's such a good idea.

3393
02:30:15.701 --> 02:30:17.007
TALIESIN: It's called a Bailey's sandwich.

3394
02:30:17.007 --> 02:30:18.233
LAURA: Thank you.
MATT: It is now.

3395
02:30:18.233 --> 02:30:20.272
MARISHA: Damn it. That looks so good.

3396
02:30:20.272 --> 02:30:23.060
LIAM: This is the D&amp;D you tune in for.

3397
02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:26.370
SAM: Are all of these Stones elves?

3398
02:30:26.370 --> 02:30:30.440
MATT: No, they're a smattering of different races, actually.

3399
02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:32.459
I'd say, interestingly enough, about

3400
02:30:32.459 --> 02:30:35.170
a quarter of them are dragonborn.

3401
02:30:35.170 --> 02:30:37.497
SAM: Okay, and then the others are...

3402
02:30:37.497 --> 02:30:38.597
LIAM: Do they have tails or not?

3403
02:30:40.510 --> 02:30:42.257
MATT: You see two with tails and many without.

3404
02:30:42.257 --> 02:30:43.092
LIAM: Okay.

3405
02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:46.870
MATT: There are elves, human.

3406
02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:52.820
You don't see much in the way of orc

3407
02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:55.920
or half-orc representation specifically here.

3408
02:30:55.920 --> 02:31:00.917
You see maybe two dwarves, but it is an eclectic

3409
02:31:02.343 --> 02:31:03.176
gathering.

3410
02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:07.130
You can see Eremis, after going into the temple, goes,

3411
02:31:07.130 --> 02:31:11.295
"I think I found her, if any of you can."

3412
02:31:12.885 --> 02:31:16.572
LAURA: Not until the morning, but if we sleep.

3413
02:31:16.572 --> 02:31:17.405
TALIESIN: I'm--

3414
02:31:18.771 --> 02:31:19.604
LAURA: Oh wait.

3415
02:31:21.254 --> 02:31:23.350
No, I used it.

3416
02:31:23.350 --> 02:31:26.341
MATT: "All right, well, we do have
beds if you need to rest."

3417
02:31:26.341 --> 02:31:29.320
LAURA: Are they made of stone?

3418
02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:31.721
MATT: "No, they're made of wood."
LAURA: Okay, cool.

3419
02:31:31.721 --> 02:31:34.079
MATT: "If you prefer a stone place to sleep."
LAURA: No, I'll take

3420
02:31:34.079 --> 02:31:35.925
wood.
MATT: "All right, all right.

3421
02:31:37.090 --> 02:31:38.840
TRAVIS: Do you mean here in this cave?"

3422
02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:41.548
I feel like we're a bit unprotected here?

3423
02:31:42.656 --> 02:31:45.580
Oh, right.
MATT: "Well, I mean,

3424
02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:49.428
"as far as I know, you destroyed

3425
02:31:49.428 --> 02:31:52.637
"the most significant threat to everything here."

3426
02:31:52.637 --> 02:31:53.765
TRAVIS: There was just the one?

3427
02:31:54.938 --> 02:31:58.044
MATT: "That I've seen at least, yes."
MARISHA: Hmm.

3428
02:31:58.044 --> 02:32:00.797
TALIESIN: Was that-- do you know where it came from?

3429
02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:03.450
MATT: "I have my theories.

3430
02:32:05.370 --> 02:32:08.837
"I'd like to ask Gaima for more guidance and specifics,

3431
02:32:08.837 --> 02:32:13.080
"but it's not-- Hmm.

3432
02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:16.901
"Our oasis, depending on how much you and your family know

3433
02:32:16.901 --> 02:32:21.901
"of our history, it draws many beasts

3434
02:32:22.690 --> 02:32:25.150
"to come and live and take of the soil

3435
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:29.900
"and eat of the interred and the delightful gifts

3436
02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:32.402
"that are granted by the surrounding jungle.

3437
02:32:33.254 --> 02:32:35.620
"A part of this cycle is the worship

3438
02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:38.537
"that we bring between the Wild Mother and Avandra.

3439
02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:45.610
"It is an occasional occurrence

3440
02:32:45.610 --> 02:32:47.800
"where entities and creatures are drawn

3441

"from beyond the Penumbra Range to the far east.

02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:53.347
"From the Miskath Strand.

02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:56.730
"A land that in itself is blighted.

02:32:56.730 --> 02:32:59.713
"I believe some refer to it as Blightshore.

3445
02:33:01.898 --> 02:33:03.031
"A very...

3446
02:33:04.473 --> 02:33:07.148
"A very necessary place

3447
02:33:07.148 --> 02:33:09.830
"to avoid, from what I've read.

3448
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:13.132
"But creatures that come from there don't come

02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:16.752
"in their normal state.

3450
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:20.490
"It's a place of twisted things."

3451
02:33:20.490 --> 02:33:24.630
LIAM: I'm sorry, did you say, "eat of the interred"?

3452
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:26.060
MATT: "Yes."

3453
02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:27.180
MARISHA: Dead people, it's a grave.

3454
02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:29.760
It's a Caduceus thing.
LAURA: But you eat them?

3455
02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:33.160
MATT: "We do not eat of them, but the animals that come

3456
02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:36.400
"and are part of this oasis, eat of the bodies

3457
02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:39.460
"as they are interred and return them to the earth."

3458
02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:41.920
LAURA: They poop them out?
MATT: "Yes."

3459
02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:43.812
LAURA: They poop the bodies out?
MATT: "Yes."

3460
02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:47.510
MARISHA: I mean, we've dranken dead people tea.

3461
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:49.200
TRAVIS: Dranken?
MARISHA: Yeah.

3462
02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:51.120
LIAM: Drankin'.
MARISHA: Is there another way to say it?

3463
02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:53.386
LAURA: That's a colloquialism from--

3464
02:33:53.386 --> 02:33:55.077
LIAM: Krunk.
MARISHA: Oh.

3465
02:33:55.077 --> 02:33:56.490
We've krunk dead people tea.

3466
02:33:56.490 --> 02:33:59.120
MATT: "Have you partaken in, perhaps,

3467
02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:05.420
"a roast or a piece of well-prepared animal meat?"

3468
02:34:06.130 --> 02:34:08.310
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: I'm a vegan.

3469
02:34:08.310 --> 02:34:10.635
SAM: I've roasted Fjord a bunch of times.

3470
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:14.393
LAURA: Is this why you don't eat meat?

3471
02:34:14.393 --> 02:34:16.293
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: Oh.

3472
02:34:16.293 --> 02:34:18.050
No, I do eat meat.

3473
02:34:18.050 --> 02:34:21.050
MATT: "Then you yourself a part of the same cycle.

3474
02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:23.200
"We just have many creatures that do it as well

3475
02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:25.491
"as part of the worship."

3476
02:34:25.491 --> 02:34:27.740
TRAVIS: What of the lake?

3477
02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:30.100
Could you tell us more about it?

3478
02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:33.010
MATT: "The lake, it seems, was placed

3479
02:34:33.010 --> 02:34:35.980
"here long ago, we believe as a beacon

"the Stone family set this place of worship,

"and begun the cycle of interment."

3488
02:35:01.165 --> 02:35:02.248
MARISHA: Huh.

3489
02:35:03.708 --> 02:35:06.787
LIAM: This must be very interesting for you

3490
02:35:06.787 --> 02:35:08.704
and your burgeoning faith.

3491
02:35:09.816 --> 02:35:12.930
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is a bit all of a history lesson.

3492
02:35:12.930 --> 02:35:15.064
MARISHA: Where's the champion?

3493
02:35:16.048 --> 02:35:18.026
MATT: "Oh, the body of the champion?"

3494
02:35:18.026 --> 02:35:18.883
MARISHA: Yeah.

3495
02:35:18.883 --> 02:35:22.074
MATT: "Oh, it's long been devoured

3496
02:35:22.074 --> 02:35:25.007
"and cast out the sands and earth around you

3497
02:35:25.007 --> 02:35:27.365
"by the creatures who've lived long before us.

02:35:27.365 --> 02:35:28.699
"Long before I did, at least."

3499
02:35:28.699 --> 02:35:32.077
MARISHA: Yes, yeah.
SAM: Did the champion leave

3500
02:35:32.077 --> 02:35:34.102
any artifacts behind?

3501
02:35:34.102 --> 02:35:36.410
MATT: "No, just the body was scattered."

3502
02:35:37.536 --> 02:35:39.683
MARISHA: Who's the current champion?

3503
02:35:39.683 --> 02:35:41.079
MATT: "I have no idea."

3504
02:35:41.079 --> 02:35:43.510
TALIESIN: It was just a champion.

3505
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:47.356
MATT: "This was a millennia ago."

3506
02:35:47.356 --> 02:35:50.273
LIAM: Myth and legend.

3507
02:35:51.410 --> 02:35:54.120
MARISHA: Is that, like, a self-proclaimed title?

3508
02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:56.267
I don't know, I'm just asking.

3509
02:35:58.100 --> 02:35:59.020
TALIESIN: Have I not, I thought I have,

3510
02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:00.920
have I not told you this story before?

3511
02:36:02.050 --> 02:36:05.930
MARISHA: Yeah, the champions of Dust, Clay, and Stone,
and all that?

3512
02:36:05.930 --> 02:36:08.790
SAM: You protect the body.
TRAVIS: How could you forget this?

3513
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:10.530
TALIESIN: We don't protect the body.

3514
02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:13.379
(laughter)

3515
02:36:13.379 --> 02:36:15.830
We gave it back, we were tasked.

3516
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:17.280
The three families were tasked.

3517
02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:19.490
MARISHA: Oh, right and you separated their bodies

3518
02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:22.420
and then you put them across in other areas--

3519
02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:24.082
MATT: (as Cornelius) "So you are teaching them as you go?"

3520
02:36:24.082 --> 02:36:26.930
MARISHA: Super macabre, and kind of fucked up.

3521
02:36:26.930 --> 02:36:28.360
That's right, though?

3522
02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:30.880
MATT: "Hey, that's mighty judgmental of you."

3523
02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:32.310
MARISHA: I'm just saying.

3524
02:36:32.310 --> 02:36:33.270
SAM: That's her.

3525
02:36:33.270 --> 02:36:35.210
TALIESIN: What would we do with you then?

3526
02:36:35.210 --> 02:36:37.871
MATT: Calliope's like, "I kind of like her."

3527
02:36:37.871 --> 02:36:39.440
LAURA: (laughs)

3528
02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:41.760
TALIESIN: When you die, what's to be done with you?

3529
02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:44.160
MARISHA: I think it really depends on how I go, right?

3530
02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:46.000
MATT: (as Cornelius) "It's an important question
and something

3531
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.230
"you should think about in an early point in your life

3532
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:51.588
"because it comes at you fast."
MARISHA: I mean, you don't

3533
02:36:51.588 --> 02:36:53.200
normally have a choice.

3534
02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.380
Those who are lucky have a choice, though.

3535
02:36:55.380 --> 02:36:57.150
MATT: "Right, but if you have a choice early

3536
02:36:57.150 --> 02:36:58.125
"then aren't you lucky?"

3537
02:36:58.125 --> 02:36:59.900
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh,

3538
02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:02.568
can you guys bake me into, like, a cupcake or something

3539
02:37:02.568 --> 02:37:04.220
and then eat me?
SAM: What?

3540
02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:07.650
TRAVIS: Are you asking us eat you?
TALIESIN: That would probably require

3541
02:37:07.650 --> 02:37:09.230
the Kiln, so it would be up north.

3542
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:10.780
MATT: "We can talk to the Dust family.

3543
02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:12.420
"I'm sure that could be done."
TALIESIN: That could be arranged.

3544
02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:15.740
MARISHA: We are surrounded by statues of people.

3545
02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:17.941
MATT: Which point, you hear Constance go--
TALIESIN: People in statues.

3546
02:37:17.941 --> 02:37:20.116
MATT: "I think I found them."

3547
02:37:21.790 --> 02:37:22.640
TALIESIN: All right, I'm--

3548
02:37:23.767 --> 02:37:26.082
MATT: And around the exterior of the shrine

3549
02:37:26.082 --> 02:37:27.142
you can see there,

3550
02:37:28.410 --> 02:37:30.710
one trying to protect the other,

3551
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:35.080
the petrified bodies of Colton and Clarabelle

3552
02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:37.220
your elder brother and sister.

3553
02:37:37.220 --> 02:37:38.986
TALIESIN: How do they look?

3554
02:37:38.986 --> 02:37:41.040
MATT: Intact, just petrified.

3555
02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:42.406
LAURA: Okay.

3556
02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:47.290
After we go to sleep, we can bring back,

3557
02:37:47.290 --> 02:37:48.630
I can bring back three people

3558
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:50.334
TALIESIN: I can bring back three people.

3559
02:37:50.334 --> 02:37:51.186
LAURA: Okay.

3560
02:37:52.278 --> 02:37:53.470
MATT: Eremis goes,

3561
02:37:53.470 --> 02:37:56.940
"And we do have a number of individuals

3562
02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:58.940
"of the Stone family that probably

3563
02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:03.680
"could take care of this problem over time.

3564
02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:05.290
"We just have to bring them back."

3565
02:38:05.290 --> 02:38:06.710
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "One of which is Gaima,

3566
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:07.676
"who I've mentioned."

3567
02:38:07.676 --> 02:38:09.684
LAURA: We'll bring back Gaima for sure tomorrow.

3568
02:38:09.684 --> 02:38:12.792
SAM: Yeah. Maybe first, actually. She-- They-- He--?

3569
02:38:12.792 --> 02:38:14.920
MATT: "She."
SAM: She could help

3570
02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:16.928
with the others.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3571
02:38:16.928 --> 02:38:19.700
MARISHA: And who is Gaima?
MATT: "Gaima Stone

3572
02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:22.579
"is partner to Darrah

3573
02:38:22.579 --> 02:38:25.230
"and the head of the guardian of the shrine."

3574
02:38:25.230 --> 02:38:27.544
LAURA: Ooh! That sounds important.

3575
02:38:27.544 --> 02:38:31.448
SAM: Also, probably Fjord's, like, mom.

3576
02:38:32.610 --> 02:38:35.790
LAURA: Is Gaima an orc?

3577
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:39.700
MATT: "No, half giant."
SAM: That's kind of like--

3578
02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:40.533
LAURA: Wow!

3579
02:38:40.533 --> 02:38:42.300
TALIESIN: You're really reaching on this one.

3580
02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:46.083
SAM: I think it's the same thing.

3581
02:38:46.083 --> 02:38:47.326
TALIESIN: Let's--

3582
02:38:47.326 --> 02:38:48.572
MARISHA: When you're three feet tall, yeah.

3583
02:38:48.572 --> 02:38:49.622
TALIESIN: (sighs)

3584
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:56.180
Maybe we rest.

3585
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:59.290
What time is it? I don't even--

3586
02:38:59.290 --> 02:39:01.200
MATT: It's later in the day. You guys were approaching

3587
02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:04.960
the oasis in the, like, mid to late afternoon.

3588
02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:05.870
So at this point,

3589
02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:07.910
it's probably getting pretty close to dusk.

3590
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:09.810
TALIESIN: As my last question before we--

3591
02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:12.750
How does your ritual work

3592
02:39:14.518 --> 02:39:17.260
with the Menagerie? What is it done

3593
02:39:18.250 --> 02:39:20.575
with those who are more interred here?

3594
02:39:21.810 --> 02:39:26.520
MATT: "Well, with the bodies that we have.

3595
02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:30.670
"There is a series of rites that we speak over the body

3596
02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:33.420
"as it is placed within the center of the temple shrine.

3597
02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:37.460
"It is prepared with all sorts of salts

3598
02:39:37.460 --> 02:39:40.240
"and other minerals that begin

3599
02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:42.080
"the process of decomposition

3600
02:39:45.620 --> 02:39:48.730
"as well as preserving elements on the surface.

3601
02:39:50.170 --> 02:39:52.910
"It is then, based on this ritual,

3602
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:55.610
"we take a sign or a vision

3603
02:39:55.610 --> 02:40:00.610
"from either be the Luck Bearer or the Wild Mother,

3604
02:40:01.470 --> 02:40:03.730
"as to which creatures of the Menagerie

3605
02:40:03.730 --> 02:40:07.440
"should be granted the body.

3606
02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:10.160
"Then we find them and we converse

3607
02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:13.980
"and if it is accepted, then it is given

3608
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:18.980
"to the creature to be buried."

3609
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:23.510
TALIESIN: Here within the cave or outside the cave?

3610
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:25.060
MATT: "Outside the cave."
TALIESIN: All right.

3611
02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:28.790
That's beautiful.

3612
02:40:31.090 --> 02:40:31.923
MARISHA: "Buried?"

3613
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:39.630
TALIESIN: Consumed.
MATT: "Consumed and then interred."

3614
02:40:39.810 --> 02:40:42.980
TRAVIS: You said this area draws animals from outside.

3615
02:40:44.030 --> 02:40:45.910
Is there any way that we might camouflage

3616
02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:47.500
the entrance to this cave?

3617
02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:52.380
I only--- something we did attracted the gorgon towards us.

3618
02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:54.880
I would hate to think that more were on the way

3619
02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:56.550
and that we tried to sleep.

3620
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:58.410
I know we may be able to be inside the dome

3621
02:40:58.410 --> 02:41:00.220
but--
LIAM: Not all of us.

3622
02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:02.565
TRAVIS: Right.
TALIESIN: How large

3623
02:41:02.565 --> 02:41:04.200
is the entrance of the cave?

3624
02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:05.140
MATT: The entrance is probably

3625
02:41:05.140 --> 02:41:09.088
about 15 feet tall, about 20 feet wide.

3626
02:41:09.981 --> 02:41:11.990
ASHLEY: I don't have to sleep in there.

3627
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:15.630
MARISHA: Eremis, is there any other entrances to this cave?

3628
02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:16.800
MATT: "Not to the outside.

3629
02:41:19.130 --> 02:41:23.790
"Well, we do have to two,

3630
02:41:23.790 --> 02:41:25.860
"relatively disused escapes,

3631
02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:28.200
"but they just vanish into the jungle.

3632
02:41:29.370 --> 02:41:30.470
"They're sealed, though."

3633
02:41:31.390 --> 02:41:33.530
TRAVIS: Sealed with stone or?

3634
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:35.871
MATT: "Sealed with metal and key."

3635
02:41:35.871 --> 02:41:38.054
TRAVIS: Oh, actual doors.

3636
02:41:39.357 --> 02:41:41.240
SAM: If we had a watch--
MATT: "We have

3637
02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:44.230
"doors," and Eremis points out

3638
02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:47.090
to the edges of the chamber and you can see beyond

3639
02:41:47.090 --> 02:41:48.970
some of these small buildings and huts,

3640
02:41:48.970 --> 02:41:52.190
there are doors and there are stairs,

3641
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:54.120
made of the same stone material

3642
02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:55.890
that blended in. You were so taken in

3643
02:41:55.890 --> 02:41:58.920
by the structures in the center of the building

3644
02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:00.620
and center of the chamber and looking

3645
02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:01.670
at the architecture around it.

3646
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:04.110
Now that you focus a bit on the outskirts, there

3647
02:42:04.110 --> 02:42:07.620
is a very intricately carved series of stairs

3648
02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:08.930
and shelves and things in the outskirts

3649
02:42:08.930 --> 02:42:11.660
and you can see, similar to, like, the Dust family

3650
02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:12.800
though on a much smaller scale,

3651
02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:15.900
there are other side chambers and rooms.

3652
02:42:15.900 --> 02:42:16.890
This was--

3653
02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:23.620
this place could probably house close to 60 or so people.

3654
02:42:23.620 --> 02:42:27.070
MARISHA: Is there anyone else not petrified?

3655
02:42:27.070 --> 02:42:29.260
Are we alone?
MATT: From what you see right now,

3656
02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:30.980
you're the only ones un-petrified.

3657
02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:32.437
LAURA: Wow!

3658
02:42:32.437 --> 02:42:35.288
We should go up some stairs and into a chamber

3659
02:42:35.288 --> 02:42:37.705
because, you know, I don't think bulls can climb stairs.

3660
02:42:37.705 --> 02:42:40.480
LIAM: I can set an alarm at the cave entrance.

3661
02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:42.150
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: To start,

3662
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:44.075
but only nine of us can fit.

3663
02:42:44.075 --> 02:42:45.775
ASHLEY: I can sleep outside of the dome.

3664
02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:50.650
LAURA: Yeah, you should have
Caduceus' family sleep in the dome.

3665
02:42:50.650 --> 02:42:52.460
MARISHA: Yeah, a few of us can sleep on the outside

3666
02:42:52.460 --> 02:42:55.950
or I can find a hut. Kind of excited to find someone's hut.

3667
02:42:55.950 --> 02:42:58.395
TALIESIN: I'm fine sleeping outside, I don't need the dome.

3668
02:42:58.395 --> 02:43:00.056
TRAVIS: Might I ask why?

3669
02:43:00.056 --> 02:43:01.820
MARISHA: It's kind of invigorating,

3670
02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:04.423
sleeping in someone else's house.
SAM: Also, I think that

3671
02:43:04.423 --> 02:43:07.014
Jester's going to want to sort of arrange

3672
02:43:07.014 --> 02:43:09.470
the stone bodies into sort of weird

3673
02:43:09.470 --> 02:43:12.620
and embarrassing positions, so that when they come back

3674
02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:14.530
to life, they just--

3675
02:43:14.530 --> 02:43:17.060
LAURA: Why didn't I think of that? Nott!

3676
02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:18.100
TALIESIN: If they break while you're moving--

3677
02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:19.170
LIAM: Yeah, you don't want to--

3678
02:43:19.170 --> 02:43:21.132
LAURA: You would make a good follower of the Traveler, Nott.

3679
02:43:21.132 --> 02:43:21.965
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

3680
02:43:21.965 --> 02:43:23.979
SAM: That's true. Like, if you made

3681
02:43:23.979 --> 02:43:28.797
some sort of weird pylon.
LIAM: Tip one over, it's, you know-

3682
02:43:28.797 --> 02:43:31.221
no take backs.
TALIESIN: Yeah, so let's not do that.

3683
02:43:31.221 --> 02:43:32.054
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: What?

3684
02:43:32.054 --> 02:43:35.950
TALIESIN: Because if you accidentally drop one, then--

3685
02:43:35.950 --> 02:43:38.768
LIAM: We just had this conversation. Harmless pranks,

3686
02:43:38.768 --> 02:43:42.483
you know, to potentially lethal on--

3687
02:43:42.483 --> 02:43:44.160
TALIESIN: And you've killed my sister and then,

3688
02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:46.525
you know, that's weird.

3689
02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:50.350
LIAM: You know what, draw a dick on somebody

3690
02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:52.740
because that is impermanent

3691
02:43:52.740 --> 02:43:53.573
and it's a dick.

3692
02:43:53.573 --> 02:43:54.989
LAURA: That doesn't sound nearly as fun.
TRAVIS: Yeah, draw a stone dick

3693
02:43:54.989 --> 02:43:56.580
on one of the statues. They wake up, and they've just got

3694
02:43:56.580 --> 02:43:58.829
one sticking out of their shoulder.
LAURA: Oh!

3695
02:43:58.829 --> 02:44:01.750
I could paint, like, a penis on the shoulder

3696
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:03.399
or something and then when they're brought back to life.

3697
02:44:03.399 --> 02:44:04.499
SAM: (screams)
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3698
02:44:04.499 --> 02:44:05.874
That's really smart, Fjord!

3699
02:44:05.874 --> 02:44:08.426
SAM: They hit it to knock it off, but that makes it harder!

3700
02:44:08.426 --> 02:44:09.704
(laughter)

3701
02:44:09.704 --> 02:44:10.781
TRAVIS: Oh god!

3702
02:44:10.781 --> 02:44:11.614
TALIESIN: Let's--

3703
02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:16.318
Let's not--
LIAM: Turn somebody into a beholder.

3704
02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:20.050
TALIESIN: Let's maybe not do that.

3705
02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:21.920
But if you do do it, do it to Colton.

3706
02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:23.052
LIAM: Pretty sure that's not how it works.

3707
02:44:23.052 --> 02:44:24.746
(laughter)

3708
02:44:24.746 --> 02:44:27.753
TALIESIN: If you do. Don't do it,
but if you do, do it to Colton.

3709
02:44:30.791 --> 02:44:33.533
LIAM: Family and heartbreak, dick statues.

3710
02:44:33.533 --> 02:44:35.515
(laughter)

3711
02:44:35.515 --> 02:44:38.150
MATT: If you guys like to,
you can find an evening here to rest

3712
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:41.210
to prepare for the next day.

3713
02:44:41.210 --> 02:44:44.200
LIAM: I honestly don't think we need the dome, for once.

3714
02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:46.739
I think a tripwire on the cave entrance

3715
02:44:46.739 --> 02:44:49.580
and some distance from that entrances is enough.

3716
02:44:49.580 --> 02:44:52.283
SAM: Agreed.
LAURA: Yeah.

3717
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.903
MATT: Okay.

3718
02:44:57.500 --> 02:44:59.940
You guys eventually find some chambers

3719
02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:01.490
that are relatively empty.

3720
02:45:01.490 --> 02:45:05.630
You do find a handful of other piles

3721
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:08.990
of relatively pulverized rock and dust

3722
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:11.430
from individuals that managed to get in the way

3723
02:45:11.430 --> 02:45:14.040
of this creature when it maybe first

3724
02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:16.240
or at some point in which it was rummaging

3725
02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:17.485
through this cave.

3726
02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:23.940
Eremis takes moments to pray and gather

3727
02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:25.890
what pieces he can. It's a very solemn,

3728
02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:29.063
climb to the end of the night,

3729
02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:34.020
but also an experience that seems not unfamiliar

3730
02:45:34.020 --> 02:45:38.710
to an individual that their purpose,

3731
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:42.360
their family is to bring those to a close

3732
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:45.788
of their journey.

3733
02:45:45.788 --> 02:45:48.271
But you guys, go ahead and rest.

3734
02:45:48.271 --> 02:45:49.379
If there's anything you want to accomplish

3735
02:45:49.379 --> 02:45:50.287
before the night's over, otherwise

3736
02:45:50.287 --> 02:45:51.987
we will go into a long rest.

3737
02:45:53.019 --> 02:45:54.894
SAM: I'll meditate a little bit.

3738
02:45:54.894 --> 02:45:56.759
LIAM: Wait, before you go into that.

3739
02:45:56.759 --> 02:45:57.592
SAM: Okay.

3740
02:45:57.592 --> 02:46:01.450
LIAM: This is a lot of god talk.

3741
02:46:01.450 --> 02:46:02.558
SAM: God talk.
LIAM: A lot of

3742
02:46:02.558 --> 02:46:05.600
god talk here. It's a bit above--

3743
02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:07.912
SAM: I'm not following most of it.

3744
02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:11.607
LIAM: Are you a follower of the Traveler yet?

3745
02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:15.275
SAM: Not yet.

3746
02:46:16.158 --> 02:46:19.791
I'm curious to see what the meeting's about.

3747
02:46:19.791 --> 02:46:22.514
LIAM: Very curious, very curious.

3748
02:46:22.514 --> 02:46:24.700
SAM: But I'm not sure if I'm ready to

3749
02:46:26.279 --> 02:46:30.339
commit to following that fellow.

3750
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:34.350
LIAM: I understand your reservation.

3751
02:46:34.350 --> 02:46:36.800
She has done great things.

3752
02:46:37.770 --> 02:46:39.667
SAM: Oh yes.
LIAM: With his aid.

3753
02:46:39.667 --> 02:46:40.500
SAM: Yes, he--

3754
02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:45.050
I have seen him do great work

3755
02:46:45.050 --> 02:46:47.720
through her, as well, but I've also seen

3756
02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:50.375
you do quite amazing things and without

3757
02:46:50.375 --> 02:46:52.700
any holy power at all.

3758
02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:55.910
LIAM: If you think about it, it's all about scale.

3759
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:56.750
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: You know.

3760
02:46:56.750 --> 02:47:00.990
The Raven Queen, the Wild Mother.

3761
02:47:00.990 --> 02:47:03.260
The things that you can do and I can do

3762
02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:07.020
or not as great as what the Wild Mother can do

3763
02:47:07.020 --> 02:47:10.770
and this other--

3764
02:47:10.770 --> 02:47:13.686
this ginger elf man thing.

3765
02:47:13.686 --> 02:47:17.030
He can do things even greater than you and I,

3766
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:18.170
but not as great as...

3767
02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:23.200
the gods reaching into our world.

3768
02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:27.558
But it's just math and scale

3769
02:47:27.558 --> 02:47:29.180
and he helps her.

3770
02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:33.650
SAM: He does, and I do like him for that.

3771
02:47:33.650 --> 02:47:34.858
I, uh--

3772
02:47:34.858 --> 02:47:36.224
LIAM: He's a little creepy.

3773
02:47:36.224 --> 02:47:38.332
But--
SAM: Well, I mean,

3774
02:47:38.332 --> 02:47:42.090
if you're really being honest, so is she sometimes,

3775
02:47:43.950 --> 02:47:47.230
but in the sweetest way.
LIAM: If I am being honest,

3776
02:47:47.230 --> 02:47:49.060
she is occasionally creepy.

3777
02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:50.491
SAM: Yeah.

3778
02:47:50.491 --> 02:47:51.646
LAURA: (offended noise)

3779
02:47:51.646 --> 02:47:54.286
SAM: In the best possible way.
LIAM: I mean, I've seen her

3780
02:47:54.286 --> 02:47:57.820
do things with an axe that would make even me blanch,

3781
02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:00.822
and I am a twisted individual.

3782
02:48:03.277 --> 02:48:04.110
But

3783
02:48:05.919 --> 02:48:08.552
pales in comparison to everything else.

3784
02:48:10.034 --> 02:48:13.750
What am I talking about? Where is your head at?

3785
02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:16.790
SAM: Well, I mean, I've been thinking about it quite some,

3786
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:21.490
quite a lot, and I must say,

3787
02:48:21.490 --> 02:48:25.773
seeing Caduceus reunited with his mother was,

3788
02:48:25.773 --> 02:48:27.298
it was wonderful.

3789
02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:31.880
It was nice.

3790
02:48:33.888 --> 02:48:35.271
I'd like that again.

3791
02:48:35.271 --> 02:48:36.104
For me.

3792
02:48:38.512 --> 02:48:40.445
LIAM: You don't want to be a goblin?

3793
02:48:40.445 --> 02:48:41.645
SAM: I don't.

3794
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:45.690
No, no.
LIAM: But what's going on in here

3795
02:48:45.690 --> 02:48:47.532
it has nothing to do with what's out here, you know,

3796
02:48:47.532 --> 02:48:50.997
so if you turn yourself back to your old you,

3797
02:48:53.250 --> 02:48:55.710
you know, wherever you are in your journey

3798
02:48:55.710 --> 02:48:58.410
and your outlook,

3799
02:48:59.318 --> 02:49:01.635
the outside is going to have no bearing on it.

3800
02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:05.700
SAM: Yeah.

3801
02:49:05.700 --> 02:49:07.360
LIAM: You still have to make the same decisions

3802
02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:10.543
even if you're back to yourself.

3803
02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:13.593
Self, what is self?

3804
02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:18.118
SAM: I do think--

3805
02:49:19.593 --> 02:49:23.840
I do think your physical appearance, it doesn't matter.

3806
02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:26.020
I mean, it's not everything.

3807
02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:27.650
LIAM: It is a reality.
SAM: Yes,

3808
02:49:27.650 --> 02:49:29.892
it has an effect on your life.

3809
02:49:31.010 --> 02:49:35.460
And I don't know how much it's had an effect on mine,

3810
02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:38.820
but I guess there's only really one way to find out.

3811
02:49:38.820 --> 02:49:40.737
LIAM: And if you change back,

3812
02:49:41.610 --> 02:49:44.100
do you know, are you going to go home

3813
02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:47.577
or to your family?

3814
02:49:51.260 --> 02:49:52.510
SAM: I think I've decided.

3815
02:49:54.270 --> 02:49:55.720
I think I've made a decision.

3816
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:03.082
But that's two decisions.

3817
02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:06.013
I've made the first.

3818
02:50:07.598 --> 02:50:09.740
I think I'm ready to change back.

3819
02:50:11.574 --> 02:50:13.530
But what happens afterwards,

3820
02:50:13.530 --> 02:50:16.032
I won't know until I get there, I think.

3821
02:50:21.153 --> 02:50:23.527
LIAM: I support whatever you choose.

3822
02:50:26.169 --> 02:50:27.964
But I will miss you, if you go.

3823
02:50:30.310 --> 02:50:32.840
SAM: I'll miss all of you, if I go,

3824
02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:34.140
I'll miss you most of all.

3825
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:40.020
Our time together has been so dangerous

3826
02:50:40.020 --> 02:50:43.320
and deadly and incredible

3827
02:50:44.887 --> 02:50:49.312
and it's been

3828
02:50:49.312 --> 02:50:52.895
wonderful saving your life again and again.

3829
02:50:53.845 --> 02:50:55.586
LIAM: I appreciate it.

3830
02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:59.530
SAM: I know you're going to use your life to do

3831
02:51:02.527 --> 02:51:04.130
(sniffs)

3832
02:51:04.130 --> 02:51:08.000
god-like things and I hope

3833
02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:09.420
I'm there to see it.

3834
02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:12.110
LIAM: Can I admit something to you?

3835
02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:12.943
SAM: Go ahead.

3836
02:51:18.490 --> 02:51:20.953
LIAM: It is a blessing to have family again.

3837
02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:29.010
And in the realest sense of the word, it has been a blessing

3838
02:51:29.010 --> 02:51:33.980
to me and I am so grateful for your presence next to me

3839
02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:35.346
on the road.

3840
02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:44.300
SAM: I feel the same, but I don't know what...

3841
02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:51.671
what our family is.

3842
02:51:51.671 --> 02:51:53.946
LIAM: Work in progress, Veth.

3843
02:51:53.946 --> 02:51:56.412
SAM: Yeah, not my...

3844
02:51:57.921 --> 02:51:58.754
Hmm.

3845
02:52:02.029 --> 02:52:02.862
Well,

3846
02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:05.143
baby steps, I suppose.

3847
02:52:05.143 --> 02:52:07.543
LIAM: Yeah. Sometimes words ruin it.

3848
02:52:07.543 --> 02:52:11.850
SAM: And I don't want to make anybody shovel 50 pounds

3849
02:52:11.850 --> 02:52:13.420
of clay while we're here, so.

3850
02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:18.680
LIAM and SAM: Soon.

3851
02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:21.768
LIAM: Soon.
SAM: And you'll be there for it.

3852
02:52:21.768 --> 02:52:23.835
LIAM: I'll absolutely be there for it.

3853
02:52:26.010 --> 02:52:30.480
SAM: All right. Well, maybe for the last time,

3854
02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:32.960
good night, Caleb.

3855
02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:38.293
LIAM: Good night, Nott the Brave.

3856
02:52:39.950 --> 02:52:42.440
TALIESIN: Oh, you two still up?

3857
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:46.010
LIAM: So much going on, Caduceus.

3858
02:52:46.010 --> 02:52:48.250
MARISHA: I'm still up.
LIAM: Jesus.

3859
02:52:48.250 --> 02:52:49.083
MARISHA: Hey.

3860
02:52:49.976 --> 02:52:51.784
Jester.
TALIESIN: I got a thing

3861
02:52:51.784 --> 02:52:54.960
I need to do. Ignore anything you hear

3862
02:52:54.960 --> 02:52:57.185
in the next five minutes, it's fine.
MARISHA: What are you doing?

3863
02:52:57.185 --> 02:52:58.890
TALIESIN: It's just a thing.
MARISHA: What are you doing?

3864
02:52:58.890 --> 02:53:00.340
TALIESIN: (shushes)
MARISHA: Why don't you just tell us,

3865
02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:01.710
you're about do it in front of us.

3866
02:53:01.710 --> 02:53:05.638
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to wander off and find Calliope.

3867
02:53:07.349 --> 02:53:09.640
MARISHA: Jester!
LAURA: What?

3868
02:53:10.824 --> 02:53:15.038
MARISHA: We have a rare gift upon us right now.

3869
02:53:15.038 --> 02:53:16.421
LAURA: In what way?

3870
02:53:18.379 --> 02:53:21.187
MARISHA: An empty town

3871
02:53:21.187 --> 02:53:23.720
with a bunch of unlocked doors.

3872
02:53:24.562 --> 02:53:26.053
LAURA: Oh god.

3873
02:53:26.053 --> 02:53:29.380
MARISHA: And no consequences.

3874
02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:32.510
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: We can get into

3875
02:53:32.510 --> 02:53:35.000
every single one of these huts.

3876
02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:36.550
LAURA: You can learn so much about people.

3877
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:37.990
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
LAURA: I can, like,

3878
02:53:37.990 --> 02:53:40.010
put dildos over everybody's bed.

3879
02:53:40.010 --> 02:53:40.843
MARISHA: Yep!

3880
02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:45.912
LAURA: We should do it.
MARISHA: It's going to be a great night.

3881
02:53:45.912 --> 02:53:48.734
LIAM: Canon.
LAURA: But.

3882
02:53:48.734 --> 02:53:49.810
We do need to get some rest

3883
02:53:49.810 --> 02:53:51.210
because I do have to do some major--

3884
02:53:51.210 --> 02:53:54.637
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, just, like, an hour.

3885
02:53:54.637 --> 02:53:56.176
LAURA: Okay, yeah, let's do it.

3886
02:53:56.176 --> 02:53:59.060
MARISHA: You think anyone else wants to come?

3887
02:53:59.060 --> 02:54:01.468
LAURA: Maybe Nott.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3888
02:54:02.850 --> 02:54:05.820
LAURA: Maybe Yasha.
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3889
02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:07.220
Maybe Fjord.

3890
02:54:07.220 --> 02:54:10.080
LAURA: I feel like Fjord's going to say no,
but we can ask him.

3891
02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:12.355
Just don't let him talk us out of it.

3892
02:54:13.230 --> 02:54:15.005
MARISHA: No! Pssh!

3893
02:54:15.005 --> 02:54:17.420
LAURA: It's really good, he's really, like, noble.

3894
02:54:17.420 --> 02:54:18.540
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

3895
02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:21.633
Should we not ask him? Is he going to be, like, a buzzkill?

3896
02:54:21.633 --> 02:54:24.914
LAURA: Maybe we should ask him.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

3897
02:54:24.914 --> 02:54:26.110
MATT: They ask you--

3898
02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:27.520
LAURA: I mean, that's everybody, basically.

3899
02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:30.207
MARISHA: Yeah. Everyone who's not preoccupied.

3900
02:54:30.207 --> 02:54:32.992
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Anyone want to go in a bunch of huts?

3901
02:54:32.992 --> 02:54:35.890
TRAVIS: What?
MARISHA: Hey, you asleep?

3902
02:54:35.890 --> 02:54:37.650
TRAVIS: Clearly not now.
MARISHA: Hey.

3903
02:54:38.610 --> 02:54:40.060
TRAVIS: What? You just said hey.

3904
02:54:40.060 --> 02:54:43.882
MARISHA: Empty town man, empty town. All us.

3905
02:54:43.882 --> 02:54:46.698
It's like time has frozen.

3906
02:54:46.698 --> 02:54:48.631
Haven't you ever had this fantasy, dude?

3907
02:54:48.631 --> 02:54:50.839
TRAVIS: People are frozen, go on.

3908
02:54:50.839 --> 02:54:55.500
MARISHA: But, like, think about it.

3909
02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:59.535
We got-- this ours. No one, come on.

3910
02:54:59.535 --> 02:55:00.771
TRAVIS: What?
MARISHA: You want to go for a walk?

3911
02:55:00.771 --> 02:55:02.529
TRAVIS: I'm still totally foggy on

3912
02:55:02.529 --> 02:55:03.515
what the fuck you're talking about.

3913
02:55:03.515 --> 02:55:05.290
LAURA: Oh my god, I have a really good idea!

3914
02:55:05.290 --> 02:55:06.980
MARISHA: What, what, what?

3915
02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:09.280
LAURA: What if, over every single door--

3916
02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:11.435
MARISHA: Okay. Ooh!
LAURA: -- we put a water pail,

3917
02:55:11.435 --> 02:55:13.170
and so as soon as they come back and they go get back

3918
02:55:13.170 --> 02:55:15.472
to get in their house, yeah, they get-- everybody gets--

3919
02:55:15.472 --> 02:55:17.740
TRAVIS: Time out, are you talking about sabotaging

3920
02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:20.020
the homes of these frozen petrified people?

3921
02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:23.500
MARISHA: No, we're talking about going for a walk.

3922
02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:26.520
TRAVIS: That doesn't sound at all
what Jester's talking about.

3923
02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:28.960
LAURA: But it's not like it's going to hurt them,

3924
02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:31.535
it's just going to cover them with water.

3925
02:55:31.535 --> 02:55:33.420
MARISHA: And maybe get, like, a bruise

3926
02:55:33.420 --> 02:55:35.965
or just, like, split their forehead.
LAURA: Baby bruise, it's no big deal.

3927
02:55:35.965 --> 02:55:39.280
TRAVIS: So the first time they
go home in, potentially, 10 years.

3928
02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:40.620
LAURA: They won't know it's been 10 years.

3929
02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:43.030
It's not going to feel like 10 years for them.

3930
02:55:43.030 --> 02:55:45.100
It's like they're going to go home, is all.

3931
02:55:45.100 --> 02:55:47.330
MARISHA: And didn't we hear Eremis say they don't keep track

3932
02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:49.780
of calendars, it doesn't matter.
TALIESIN: I'm somehow responsible for this.

3933
02:55:49.780 --> 02:55:50.846
TRAVIS: Sure, let's do it.

3934
02:55:50.846 --> 02:55:52.150
LAURA and MARISHA: (cheering)

3935
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:53.733
LAURA: Nott.
MARISHA: Yasha.

3936
02:55:53.733 --> 02:55:54.875
LAURA: Caleb.
SAM: What?

3937
02:55:54.875 --> 02:55:55.708
MARISHA: Let's go!

3938
02:55:56.553 --> 02:55:59.353
ASHLEY: I am curious about people's homes.
LAURA: Chaos Crew!

3939
02:55:59.353 --> 02:56:01.426
LAURA and MARISHA: Chaos Crew!

3940
02:56:01.426 --> 02:56:03.034
TALIESIN: Yay, temple defiling. Oh no.

3941
02:56:03.034 --> 02:56:05.140
SAM: I'm going to try to find, like,

3942
02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:08.660
some pine cones or large nuts

3943
02:56:08.660 --> 02:56:10.955
from a fruit tree or something

3944
02:56:10.955 --> 02:56:13.330
and I'm going to try to put, like, a pine cone

3945
02:56:13.330 --> 02:56:16.380
in everybody's hand who's frozen.

3946
02:56:16.380 --> 02:56:18.437
Just so, when they all wake up, they'll be like,

3947
02:56:18.437 --> 02:56:20.897
"What the fuck am I holding a pine cone in my hand for?"

3948
02:56:20.897 --> 02:56:22.382
LAURA: That's really good.
TALIESIN: Now that--

3949
02:56:22.382 --> 02:56:24.958
LAURA: Oh my god, it's so good.

3950
02:56:24.958 --> 02:56:26.860
ASHLEY: I don't want to put them any more pain

3951
02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:29.143
than they were going through?
TRAVIS: Yasha, I'm just going to keep an eye on them.

3952
02:56:29.143 --> 02:56:30.150
I'm not going to participate.

3953
02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:32.050
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, okay, yeah.

3954
02:56:32.050 --> 02:56:34.590
MATT: In the meantime--
MARISHA: I'm going to--

3955
02:56:34.590 --> 02:56:36.950
TRAVIS: How long-- set a time limit because

3956
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:38.770
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.
TRAVIS: I'm really fucking broke.

3957
02:56:38.770 --> 02:56:43.110
MARISHA: Yeah, just, like, one hour.

3958
02:56:43.110 --> 02:56:45.050
TRAVIS: One hour, coming home.

3959
02:56:45.050 --> 02:56:47.690
Streetlamps come on, come back home.

3960
02:56:47.690 --> 02:56:49.090
ASHLEY: One hour.
MARISHA: One-ish hour.

3961
02:56:49.090 --> 02:56:50.650
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Sundown.

3962
02:56:50.650 --> 02:56:54.910
MARISHA: One-ish. You know, if we
get caught up in something,

3963
02:56:54.910 --> 02:56:56.720
you know, maybe it'll, like, distract us,

3964
02:56:56.720 --> 02:57:00.440
but like, roughly 60-ish minutes.

3965
02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:02.010
Maybe 90 minutes.

3966
02:57:02.010 --> 02:57:03.310
SAM: And then I'm going to pick one guy

3967
02:57:03.310 --> 02:57:06.330
to have a sack of pine cones.

3968
02:57:06.330 --> 02:57:08.130
(laughter)

3969
02:57:08.130 --> 02:57:10.520
TALIESIN: This is how weird bank holidays get started.

3970
02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:11.660
MATT: Yep.

3971
02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:14.880
All righty, so while you guys having this conversation--

3972
02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:16.130
MARISHA: I'm going to take everyone's mail

3973
02:57:16.130 --> 02:57:18.881
and I just want to, like, steal some.

3974
02:57:18.881 --> 02:57:21.200
But also, like, rearrange others.

3975
02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:23.600
MATT: Got it, we'll get to all this

3976
02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:25.290
after we finish Caduceus'.

3977
02:57:25.290 --> 02:57:28.942
TALIESIN: Beau, your Marisha is
still going, I'm just saying.

3978
02:57:28.942 --> 02:57:31.755
MATT: The person is actually very heavily focused on.

3979
02:57:31.755 --> 02:57:34.420
TALIESIN: That's okay. I appreciate this going to make this.

3980
02:57:34.420 --> 02:57:35.253
Weirder.
MATT: I know,

3981
02:57:35.253 --> 02:57:36.610
and we'll come back to it, so.

3982
02:57:36.610 --> 02:57:38.070
TALIESIN: Very quietly.
MATT: Yeah.

3983
02:57:39.013 --> 02:57:40.950
TALIESIN: I want to see if I'm very gently going to try

3984
02:57:40.950 --> 02:57:44.350
and find where where Calliope is

3985
02:57:45.973 --> 02:57:49.020
sleeping and it just to see if she's asleep

3986
02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:51.917
which-- <i>very</i> quietly.

3987
02:57:53.630 --> 02:57:56.450
MATT: You go and walk across the area,

3988
02:57:56.450 --> 02:57:58.500
keeping an eye out and...

3989
02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:04.180
you pass by the exterior

3990
02:58:04.180 --> 02:58:06.110
of the central temple structure

3991
02:58:07.270 --> 02:58:09.030
and you see a figure sitting

3992
02:58:09.030 --> 02:58:12.830
on the edge of the water. And you look closely

3993
02:58:12.830 --> 02:58:16.410
and you can tell from this distance, which isn't too far,

3994
02:58:16.410 --> 02:58:18.410
and with the glow from the water,

3995
02:58:20.010 --> 02:58:22.660
the temple base water itself, this appears

3996
02:58:22.660 --> 02:58:25.360
to be Calliope, sitting along the edge,

3997
02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:28.310
toes dipped into the pool.

3998
02:58:28.310 --> 02:58:30.933
Just looking into it.

3999
02:58:30.933 --> 02:58:33.025
TALIESIN: As quietly as I'm as I can.

4000
02:58:34.850 --> 02:58:38.290
I'm going to very very gently,

4001
02:58:40.110 --> 02:58:42.890
quietly walk up to her without disturbing her.

4002
02:58:42.890 --> 02:58:43.723
MATT: Okay.

4003
02:58:46.910 --> 02:58:48.350
You approach and you can see

4004
02:58:48.350 --> 02:58:51.167
she's just holding this single crystal.

4005
02:58:53.310 --> 02:58:57.585
She's looking at the water, and looking at the crystal.

4006
02:58:57.585 --> 02:59:02.400
Looking at the structure above her. Sighs very heavily.

4007
02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:03.960
TALIESIN: There's no one else around?

4008
02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:07.340
MATT: At the moment no,
other than no one who's not petrified, at least.

4009
02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:11.902
TALIESIN: I very quietly, so slowly

4010
02:59:13.230 --> 02:59:15.687
get as close as I can

4011
02:59:16.531 --> 02:59:19.323
and remove the bone flute from my pocket.

4012
02:59:19.323 --> 02:59:21.916
MATT: Roll a stealth check for me, Caduceus.

4013
02:59:21.916 --> 02:59:25.243
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch, I am so proud.

4014
02:59:25.243 --> 02:59:27.892
TALIESIN: I've been waiting so long for this.

4015
02:59:27.892 --> 02:59:30.500
MARISHA: Chaos Crew.
TRAVIS: The dice can tell.

4016
02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:31.333
LAURA: (gasps)

4017
02:59:31.333 --> 02:59:32.736
TALIESIN: 19.

4018
02:59:32.736 --> 02:59:34.470
(laughter)

4019
02:59:39.760 --> 02:59:44.760
MATT: You're-- you are not the most quiet individual.

4020
02:59:44.980 --> 02:59:47.570
In your life, you've tried at times

4021
02:59:47.570 --> 02:59:50.300
and with distraction, you've been helpful.

4022
02:59:50.300 --> 02:59:51.350
And then this moment,

4023
02:59:52.300 --> 02:59:57.115
this soft smile of the
Wild Mother looks upon you.

4024
02:59:57.115 --> 02:59:59.900
(laughter)

4025
02:59:59.900 --> 03:00:04.560
As your feet touch soft, red earth,

4026
03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:07.013
just enough carried on the bottom when you touch

4027
03:00:07.013 --> 03:00:09.730
the stone of the interior of the temple,

4028
03:00:09.730 --> 03:00:12.270
nary a sound is made. Calliope is

4029
03:00:12.270 --> 03:00:15.100
none the wiser of your presence as you approach,

4030
03:00:15.100 --> 03:00:17.270
but a foot and a half behind her.

4031
03:00:18.649 --> 03:00:22.090
She sits there, her toe curling in the water.

4032
03:00:22.090 --> 03:00:26.404
You can hear, she begins to whisper a silent prayer.

4033
03:00:28.046 --> 03:00:30.446
TALIESIN: (muffled high-pitched scream)

4034
03:00:30.446 --> 03:00:33.237
MATT: "(shrieks)" She just falls into the pool.

4035
03:00:33.237 --> 03:00:35.345
(laughter)
(sploosh)

4036
03:00:35.345 --> 03:00:37.070
TRAVIS: Tell me she drops the crystal.

4037
03:00:37.070 --> 03:00:38.930
MATT: Oh yeah, no, the crystal goes in.

4038
03:00:38.930 --> 03:00:42.360
She immediately goes like, "Ah, no!

4039
03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:44.320
"Caduceus!"

4040
03:00:44.320 --> 03:00:46.820
She takes the crystal that fell
in the water and throws it at you.

4041
03:00:46.820 --> 03:00:47.990
TALIESIN: I run.

4042
03:00:47.990 --> 03:00:50.928
(laughter)
(crystal clattering)

4043
03:00:50.928 --> 03:00:53.480
MATT: She gets up out of the pool and she chases you.

4044
03:00:53.480 --> 03:00:55.218
TALIESIN: I got you something.

4045
03:00:55.218 --> 03:00:56.757
I'll stop at the front of the cave

4046
03:00:56.757 --> 03:00:58.157
because I definitely know she cannot run.

4047
03:00:58.157 --> 03:00:59.380
MATT: Okay.

4048
03:00:59.380 --> 03:01:01.500
Make an athletics check.

4049
03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:04.258
TALIESIN: Oh boy, oh my favorite.

4050
03:01:06.290 --> 03:01:08.000
Nine.
MATT: Nope, she knocks

4051
03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:09.613
your ass to the ground.

4052
03:01:09.613 --> 03:01:10.896
She full on, like (boof)

4053
03:01:10.896 --> 03:01:12.860
tackle charges you. You fall on the ground, you both

4054
03:01:12.860 --> 03:01:14.760
tumble a bit, you fall into your back,

4055
03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:16.810
and she stands up and puts her foot on your chest.

4056
03:01:16.810 --> 03:01:19.530
Wet, her hair just soaked down in front of her face.

4057
03:01:19.530 --> 03:01:23.760
(breathes heavily)
(laughter)

4058
03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:26.112
TALIESIN: I've been carrying that thing for so long.

4059
03:01:26.112 --> 03:01:27.201
(laughter)

4060
03:01:27.201 --> 03:01:29.982
MATT: "I was going to thank you.

4061
03:01:29.982 --> 03:01:30.815
"Was."

4062
03:01:32.324 --> 03:01:33.728
TALIESIN: You must have enjoyed that.

4063
03:01:33.728 --> 03:01:35.850
(laughter)

4064
03:01:37.050 --> 03:01:40.106
MATT: "It's coming back to you.
It's all coming back to you."

4065
03:01:40.106 --> 03:01:40.939
TALIESIN: We'll see.

4066
03:01:42.720 --> 03:01:45.520
I hold it up.
MATT: The crystal?

4067
03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:47.380
TALIESIN: No, I hold up-- I actually hold up the bone flute.

4068
03:01:47.380 --> 03:01:48.690
MATT: Oh, the bone flute?

4069
03:01:48.690 --> 03:01:49.523
She takes it.

4070
03:01:50.740 --> 03:01:52.020
"Where the hell did you get this?"

4071
03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:53.311
TALIESIN: Oh, around.

4072
03:01:55.260 --> 03:01:59.693
MATT: "It's mine now, until you earn it back."

4073
03:02:00.650 --> 03:02:03.250
TALIESIN: Be a shame if something
happens to Colton tomorrow.

4074
03:02:04.086 --> 03:02:08.132
And I start to get up, pick up the crystal

4075
03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:11.178
Just sayin'.

4076
03:02:11.178 --> 03:02:12.319
MATT: "Hmph."

4077
03:02:16.740 --> 03:02:18.292
Make a strength saving throw.

4078
03:02:19.441 --> 03:02:21.599
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

4079
03:02:21.599 --> 03:02:22.780
12.
MATT: 12.

4080
03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:24.270
She sweeps your legs out from under you.

4081
03:02:24.270 --> 03:02:26.066
You fall right to the ground again.

4082
03:02:26.066 --> 03:02:28.943
This is going to hit your hip, and you're like. (groans)

4083
03:02:29.885 --> 03:02:32.780
TALIESIN: Oh man, I've missed you. (laughs)

4084
03:02:32.780 --> 03:02:35.330
MATT: She reaches down and puts
her hand out and picks you up.

4085
03:02:37.053 --> 03:02:39.670
"I missed you, too."
TALIESIN: Hug.

4086
03:02:39.670 --> 03:02:42.380
MATT: She gives you a hug back, but kind of a side hug,

4087
03:02:42.380 --> 03:02:44.547
but gives into it.

4088
03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:50.830
"You're such ... you're such a <i>you</i>."

4089
03:02:50.830 --> 03:02:52.330
TALIESIN: I think I've gotten weirder.

4090
03:02:53.311 --> 03:02:55.146
MATT: "That's not even possible."

4091
03:02:55.146 --> 03:02:56.830
TALIESIN: I know, right?
MATT: "What have

4092
03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:58.350
"your friends done to you?"

4093
03:02:58.350 --> 03:03:01.867
TALIESIN: They're very strange, especially the blue one.

4094
03:03:04.548 --> 03:03:07.780
MATT: "Well, maybe some family time will do you good."

4095
03:03:07.780 --> 03:03:08.830
TALIESIN: Oh.

4096
03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:12.600
Actually...

4097
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:17.600
you were right about a lot of things.

4098
03:03:18.974 --> 03:03:20.640
MATT: "I know that."

4099
03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:21.473
TALIESIN: I've been out there.

4100
03:03:21.473 --> 03:03:25.340
I've seen a lot. I've seen <i>a lot</i>.

4101
03:03:28.128 --> 03:03:30.543
I don't entirely know who I am anymore.

4102
03:03:35.950 --> 03:03:40.950
This past ... however long, I've...

4103
03:03:44.340 --> 03:03:46.560
Leaving home changes you.

4104
03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:48.492
MATT: "Yeah, I know.

4105
03:03:48.492 --> 03:03:51.120
"I'm surprised it took you long
enough to step out for a bit."

4106
03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:54.160
TALIESIN: I wasn't going to be the one.

4107
03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:57.460
I was supposed to stay so that the rest of you could leave.

4108
03:03:59.072 --> 03:04:00.155
MATT: "Well, I'm...

4109
03:04:01.080 --> 03:04:03.800
"I'm glad you over...

4110
03:04:05.910 --> 03:04:09.610
"overcame your need to stay and got a little stir crazy."

4111
03:04:09.610 --> 03:04:13.070
TALIESIN: I may not be done and I don't know

4112
03:04:13.070 --> 03:04:14.803
what to tell Mom and Dad yet.

4113
03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:23.060
MATT: She stops for a second and looks

4114
03:04:24.290 --> 03:04:26.890
at your hand where you're holding the crystal.

4115
03:04:26.890 --> 03:04:29.715
You can see, the crystal itself,

4116
03:04:29.715 --> 03:04:32.740
the exact same coloration,

4117
03:04:32.740 --> 03:04:35.780
a deepish purple color.

4118
03:04:35.780 --> 03:04:39.610
So the ones that you had formulated

4119
03:04:39.610 --> 03:04:43.310
within the fires of Kravaraad

4120
03:04:43.310 --> 03:04:46.250
within the kiln and, at the edges of it,

4121
03:04:46.250 --> 03:04:50.570
you can see these little spikes protruding

4122
03:04:50.570 --> 03:04:53.210
just ever so slightly. Like little tack points,

4123
03:04:53.210 --> 03:04:55.965
pushing out in four or five different places.

4124
03:05:03.910 --> 03:05:07.478
She takes it and looks at it,

4125
03:05:09.060 --> 03:05:10.843
looks back in the temple

4126
03:05:13.650 --> 03:05:15.049
and she starts walking back to the--

4127
03:05:15.049 --> 03:05:16.798
TALIESIN: I follow.
MATT: -- center of the structure.

4128
03:05:17.710 --> 03:05:19.070
You both walk up to the edge of the water,

4129
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:20.260
herself still dripping and leaving

4130
03:05:20.260 --> 03:05:22.970
this trail to the edge of the pool.

4131
03:05:22.970 --> 03:05:26.370
She holds it and throws it back into the water. (splash)

4132
03:05:26.370 --> 03:05:30.065
You see it slowly sink to the bottom.

4133
03:05:30.065 --> 03:05:32.990
That odd, undulating glow,

4134
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:36.750
shifting back and forth from the structure around.

4135
03:05:36.750 --> 03:05:39.080
It's lit from underneath

4136
03:05:39.080 --> 03:05:42.140
by the stone build and whatever enchantment

4137
03:05:42.140 --> 03:05:44.960
holds the bottom of the temple pool floor.

4138
03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:49.240
And from those points, they seem to continue to extend.

4139
03:05:52.050 --> 03:05:55.700
As these long, thin, crooked,

4140
03:05:55.700 --> 03:05:58.250
pseudopod-like extensions begin

4141
03:05:58.250 --> 03:06:02.780
to grow out them like roots, like a potato that's been left

4142
03:06:02.780 --> 03:06:07.730
in a pantry too long and begins to just expand.

4143
03:06:07.730 --> 03:06:10.149
You begin to recall elements

4144
03:06:10.149 --> 03:06:14.850
of the visions that you had of these crystals taking root

4145
03:06:14.850 --> 03:06:17.588
eventually, at their final destination.

4146
03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:20.025
She goes,

4147
03:06:21.125 --> 03:06:24.690
"I feel like I remember something like that."

4148
03:06:24.690 --> 03:06:25.900
TALIESIN: Me too.

4149
03:06:25.900 --> 03:06:27.775
MATT: "You found some of these?"

4150
03:06:30.330 --> 03:06:31.163
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4151
03:06:35.290 --> 03:06:36.123
Here, you think?

4152
03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:38.693
MATT: "I mean."

4153
03:06:39.563 --> 03:06:40.613
(splashing)

4154
03:06:40.613 --> 03:06:43.720
You throw the handful of crystals that you had refined.

4155
03:06:43.720 --> 03:06:46.060
As they all slowly settle down,

4156
03:06:46.060 --> 03:06:49.663
you watch as, one by one, they all begin to

4157
03:06:49.663 --> 03:06:51.818
expand in the same way.

4158
03:06:51.818 --> 03:06:55.379
These points, like, jutting out of them,

4159
03:06:55.379 --> 03:06:57.610
another, a little slower, like branches

4160
03:06:57.610 --> 03:06:59.760
beginning to grow from the crystal.

4161
03:06:59.760 --> 03:07:03.210
Like they become these odd small hearts

4162
03:07:03.210 --> 03:07:06.723
with veins extruding to fine points.

4163
03:07:07.779 --> 03:07:11.760
It's very, very odd, but weirdly beautiful

4164
03:07:11.760 --> 03:07:14.152
and they extend, just a little ways out

4165
03:07:14.152 --> 03:07:15.670
from what was once a thin crystal

4166
03:07:15.670 --> 03:07:18.390
to no further than that and they stop,

4167
03:07:21.070 --> 03:07:23.308
like partially germinated seeds.

4168
03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:26.830
TALIESIN: It's time to take him home.

4169
03:07:30.630 --> 03:07:31.463
MATT: "I guess so."

4170
03:07:37.186 --> 03:07:38.986
TALIESIN: I don't know if I can go home yet.

4171
03:07:42.650 --> 03:07:46.040
I owe such a debt, and

4172
03:07:46.040 --> 03:07:46.873
I don't,

4173
03:07:50.950 --> 03:07:51.850
I don't know if...

4174
03:08:02.080 --> 03:08:03.880
I don't know if, I'm ready to plant.

4175
03:08:08.536 --> 03:08:12.510
MATT: "Well--"
TALIESIN: Soon.

4176
03:08:12.510 --> 03:08:16.210
MATT: "You could always keep them on you and

4177
03:08:16.210 --> 03:08:18.030
"when you come back and you're ready.

4178
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:21.071
"Just don't take too long. I mean, we--"

4179
03:08:21.071 --> 03:08:25.688
TALIESIN: I was going to send them with you. But--

4180
03:08:25.688 --> 03:08:28.200
MATT: "With me?"

4181
03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:29.917
TALIESIN: Are you going home?

4182
03:08:31.440 --> 03:08:32.910
MATT: "If you're not, someone has to.

4183
03:08:32.910 --> 03:08:34.920
"I got to protect the rest of these knuckleheads,"

4184
03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:37.500
and she points over a shoulder.

4185
03:08:37.500 --> 03:08:38.333
TALIESIN: Maybe...

4186
03:08:42.510 --> 03:08:46.470
talk about it in the morning, but I'd appreciate--

4187
03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:50.493
I don't know how to talk to mom and dad yet.

4188
03:08:52.384 --> 03:08:54.370
[inaudible]

4189
03:08:54.370 --> 03:08:57.853
Corrin would be a help, but we'll see.

4190
03:08:57.853 --> 03:08:59.486
MATT: "Hopefully in the morning.

4191
03:09:00.770 --> 03:09:02.417
"If you want me to take these back

4192
03:09:02.417 --> 03:09:04.437
"and we can plant them in your stead,

4193
03:09:05.550 --> 03:09:07.120
"hopefully you'll come home to a...

4194
03:09:09.507 --> 03:09:11.275
"a safer homestead."

4195
03:09:14.850 --> 03:09:16.200
TALIESIN: Then you can leave.

4196
03:09:20.640 --> 03:09:22.440
MATT: "Yeah."
TALIESIN: You've wanted it longer than I have.

4197
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:25.841
Get some sleep.

4198
03:09:27.460 --> 03:09:28.800
MATT: "Someone's got to pull those out first,"

4199
03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:31.408
and she pushes you into the pool. (splashes)

4200
03:09:32.380 --> 03:09:33.600
Watches over.

4201
03:09:34.820 --> 03:09:36.240
"So pick them up."

4202
03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:40.090
TALIESIN: I put all three up on the ledge.

4203
03:09:40.090 --> 03:09:41.942
I make a grab for the hand.

4204
03:09:41.942 --> 03:09:43.940
(laughter)

4205
03:09:44.990 --> 03:09:47.531
MATT: Go ahead and make a-- this would be--

4206
03:09:47.531 --> 03:09:49.580
TALIESIN: Dex?

4207
03:09:49.580 --> 03:09:51.080
MATT: We'll see you grab her. This is a strength check

4208
03:09:51.080 --> 03:09:53.110
to see if you can manage to overpull, so.

4209
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:56.572
TALIESIN: Okay, I would have been
thinking about it, so here we go.

4210
03:09:56.572 --> 03:09:57.536
LAURA: Oh!
TALIESIN: Nope.

4211
03:09:57.536 --> 03:09:58.456
LIAM: No!

4212
03:09:59.706 --> 03:10:02.140
MATT: You grab. Her hand slips out

4213
03:10:02.140 --> 03:10:04.382
and she puts her foot forward, not painfully,

4214
03:10:04.382 --> 03:10:06.506
but just pushes into your face.

4215
03:10:06.506 --> 03:10:08.789
And much like the Santa Claus in Christmas Story,

4216
03:10:08.789 --> 03:10:11.249
just slowly pushes you back into the pool.

4217
03:10:11.249 --> 03:10:12.923
TALIESIN: I'm looking up.

4218
03:10:12.923 --> 03:10:15.120
I bob back up.

4219
03:10:15.120 --> 03:10:17.320
Later, then.
LAURA: You still have--

4220
03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:19.597
MATT: "Good night, Caduceus."
LAURA: Water breathing.

4221
03:10:19.597 --> 03:10:22.696
TALIESIN: It's gone now.
LAURA: It lasts for 24 hours, doesn't it?

4222
03:10:22.696 --> 03:10:25.613
(laughter)

4223
03:10:26.600 --> 03:10:28.010
MATT: She grabs the crystals and puts them

4224
03:10:28.010 --> 03:10:30.500
into the satchel and turns around and leaves.

4225
03:10:30.500 --> 03:10:31.940
TALIESIN: I'm going to soggy my way back to this.

4226
03:10:31.940 --> 03:10:34.520
LIAM: Float to the bottom like
Bill Murray in Rushmore, just--

4227
03:10:36.260 --> 03:10:38.720
MATT: As you walk past, you can't help but being

4228
03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:41.999
the high perception Caduceus you are,

4229
03:10:41.999 --> 03:10:44.092
watch as a faint

4230
03:10:44.092 --> 03:10:48.273
Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies track of music

4231
03:10:48.273 --> 03:10:50.889
echoes through the cavern as the rest of your group begins

4232
03:10:50.889 --> 03:10:54.347
to just dart from hut, to hut, to hut.

4233
03:10:54.347 --> 03:10:59.347
Exploring the weirdly disturbing ghost town

4234
03:10:59.347 --> 03:11:02.450
of this cave, as everyone is still stone

4235
03:11:02.450 --> 03:11:06.260
and locked in various phases of fear or anger.

4236
03:11:06.260 --> 03:11:08.443
As you begin to...

4237
03:11:08.443 --> 03:11:10.310
peruse their personal belongings?

4238
03:11:10.310 --> 03:11:12.280
What are you doing, guys? What are you doing?

4239
03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:16.130
ASHLEY: I'm going to rearrange the furniture.

4240
03:11:16.130 --> 03:11:18.680
So I'm thinking a couch--
TRAVIS: Yasha!

4241
03:11:18.680 --> 03:11:19.946
ASHLEY: What? It's harmless.

4242
03:11:19.946 --> 03:11:23.730
A couch in the kitchen and then put the dining room

4243
03:11:23.730 --> 03:11:27.480
chairs and table in the bedroom.

4244
03:11:28.323 --> 03:11:30.700
MARISHA: Can we stack them in weird ways?

4245
03:11:30.700 --> 03:11:32.360
ASHLEY: Yes.
MARISHA: Poltergeist shit.

4246
03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:33.820
ASHLEY: Yep. I like it.

4247
03:11:33.820 --> 03:11:36.670
MATT: No human would stack chairs like this.

4248
03:11:36.670 --> 03:11:38.480
LIAM: A caveat, Caleb didn't go. He's doing

4249
03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:41.630
something utility back with Caduceus' stone family.

4250
03:11:41.630 --> 03:11:44.380
MATT: You got it, you got it.

4251
03:11:44.380 --> 03:11:45.780
TALIESIN: I'm just going to--

4252
03:11:47.538 --> 03:11:49.405
LAURA: I'm going to look for underwear.

4253
03:11:49.405 --> 03:11:50.821
TALIESIN: Are you all...

4254
03:11:52.209 --> 03:11:54.270
defiling the--
TRAVIS: Yes, they are.

4255
03:11:54.270 --> 03:11:56.479
ASHLEY: No defiling.
MARISHA: No.

4256
03:11:56.479 --> 03:11:57.570
TALIESIN: -- petrified temple

4257
03:11:57.570 --> 03:11:59.538
of the Wild Mother right now?

4258
03:11:59.538 --> 03:12:01.508
MARISHA: They're not temples; it's their huts!

4259
03:12:01.508 --> 03:12:04.100
LAURA: We're just doing the houses.
MARISHA: These beds

4260
03:12:04.100 --> 03:12:09.100
that people definitely masturbate in |
are not fucking temples.

4261
03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:13.960
TALIESIN: They're cloisters in the temple of the--

4262
03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:16.162
ASHLEY: What's a cloister?

4263
03:12:16.162 --> 03:12:17.717
LAURA: It's a place where you masturbate.

4264
03:12:17.717 --> 03:12:20.135
(laughter)

4265
03:12:20.135 --> 03:12:21.786
TALIESIN: Not arguing with that.

4266
03:12:21.786 --> 03:12:25.850
(laughter)

4267
03:12:25.850 --> 03:12:27.856
Nope, not arguing with that.

4268
03:12:27.856 --> 03:12:32.764
(laughter)

4269
03:12:35.372 --> 03:12:37.476
ASHLEY: So it's okay, then.

4270
03:12:37.476 --> 03:12:39.126
TRAVIS: I feel like, at least, if we watch then

4271
03:12:39.126 --> 03:12:42.312
it's like, sanctioned or something.

4272
03:12:43.783 --> 03:12:46.468
TALIESIN: I'm disappointed the least in you.

4273
03:12:46.468 --> 03:12:48.860
TRAVIS: Thank you.
TALIESIN: And I walk back to the--

4274
03:12:48.860 --> 03:12:52.370
MARISHA: I pass Jester a bottle of wine.

4275
03:12:52.370 --> 03:12:55.218
TRAVIS: What did you find that?
MARISHA: I swiped it from my parents,

4276
03:12:55.218 --> 03:12:56.609
obviously.

4277
03:12:57.643 --> 03:13:00.380
LAURA: What do you mean to do with it?
MARISHA: You drink from it.

4278
03:13:00.380 --> 03:13:01.858
LAURA: Oh!
SAM: She doesn't drink.

4279
03:13:01.858 --> 03:13:04.278
LAURA: Beau, that's really sweet of you.

4280
03:13:04.278 --> 03:13:07.340
I like to prank completely sober, though,

4281
03:13:07.340 --> 03:13:08.864
so I don't let it go too far.

4282
03:13:08.864 --> 03:13:10.223
(laughter)

4283
03:13:10.223 --> 03:13:12.202
I pass it to Yasha.
MARISHA: Yasha.

4284
03:13:12.202 --> 03:13:13.784
TALIESIN: Your body is a temple.

4285
03:13:13.784 --> 03:13:15.968
LAURA: My body is a temple.

4286
03:13:15.968 --> 03:13:17.353
MATT: Your body is a cloister.

4287
03:13:17.353 --> 03:13:20.511
TALIESIN: Yes, thank you!

4288
03:13:20.511 --> 03:13:22.192
LIAM: If that were true, she'd be drawing dicks on it.

4289
03:13:22.192 --> 03:13:24.267
(laughter)

4290
03:13:24.267 --> 03:13:27.168
SAM: I better obtain.
ASHLEY: You're going to obtain.

4291
03:13:27.168 --> 03:13:29.898
(laughter)

4292
03:13:29.898 --> 03:13:30.731
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4293
03:13:30.731 --> 03:13:31.727
TALIESIN: Oh!
LIAM: Wow!

4294
03:13:31.727 --> 03:13:33.243
TRAVIS: That is a text thread thing!

4295
03:13:33.243 --> 03:13:37.580
LIAM: Because it's an inside joke,
it makes no sense to the audience!

4296
03:13:37.580 --> 03:13:38.513
Wow!

4297
03:13:38.513 --> 03:13:41.180
TRAVIS: Only eight people know what that means.

4298
03:13:41.180 --> 03:13:42.569
ASHLEY: I knew that was coming.

4299
03:13:42.569 --> 03:13:46.769
SAM: You see, Marisha doesn't know how to spell sometimes.

4300
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:49.710
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: How long have you--?

4301
03:13:49.710 --> 03:13:50.971
Nope, no, I don't want to know.
TRAVIS: Good job.

4302
03:13:50.971 --> 03:13:52.336
LIAM: Woo!

4303
03:13:52.336 --> 03:13:55.019
LAURA: I'm going to take underwear that I find--
ASHLEY: Fjord?

4304
03:13:55.019 --> 03:13:56.633
TRAVIS: No, I'm fine.

4305
03:13:56.633 --> 03:14:00.307
and just leave it in weird places in the house.

4306
03:14:00.307 --> 03:14:02.318
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

4307
03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:05.990
LAURA: Help me, Traveler, guide me.

4308
03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:12.740
No, 10.
MATT: Okay.

4309
03:14:12.740 --> 03:14:15.450
LAURA: But it's underwear.
MATT: Right.

4310
03:14:15.450 --> 03:14:17.630
TRAVIS: 10 year old underwear.

4311
03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:22.010
MATT: A subterranean temple to the Wild Mother.

4312
03:14:22.900 --> 03:14:26.300
The south end of Wildemount.

4313
03:14:26.300 --> 03:14:29.410
You gather, within a short time of searching,

4314
03:14:29.410 --> 03:14:32.271
the people here: probably not that into underwear.

4315
03:14:32.271 --> 03:14:33.949
LAURA: (gasps)
MATT: There's just none.

4316
03:14:33.949 --> 03:14:35.317
They're probably free balling.

4317
03:14:35.317 --> 03:14:37.440
LAURA: They're all free balling?!

4318
03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:39.580
TRAVIS: ♪ 'Cause I'm free ♪
LAURA: Caduceus.

4319
03:14:39.580 --> 03:14:41.071
TALIESIN: The Stone family goes commando.
LAURA: Caduceus!

4320
03:14:41.071 --> 03:14:42.859
TRAVIS: ♪ Free balling! ♪

4321
03:14:42.859 --> 03:14:44.870
LAURA: Does your family wear underwear?

4322
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:46.417
TALIESIN: I don't know what that means.

4323
03:14:46.417 --> 03:14:47.500
LAURA: (gasps)

4324
03:14:47.500 --> 03:14:48.512
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: What's underwear?

4325
03:14:48.512 --> 03:14:52.048
TRAVIS: Just one layer of clothes between him and you.

4326
03:14:52.048 --> 03:14:52.881
MATT: (laughs)

4327
03:14:52.881 --> 03:14:55.860
LAURA: All these people with no undies. You?

4328
03:14:55.860 --> 03:14:58.360
SAM: Nott, nope.
LAURA: You?

4329
03:14:58.360 --> 03:15:00.830
MARISHA: Of course, what, of course.

4330
03:15:00.830 --> 03:15:01.890
LAURA: Fjord?
TRAVIS: I'm not answering

4331
03:15:01.890 --> 03:15:02.723
this question.

4332
03:15:02.723 --> 03:15:03.556
LAURA: Do you wear underwear?

4333
03:15:03.556 --> 03:15:04.970
Do you wear boxers or briefs?

4334
03:15:04.970 --> 03:15:06.530
MARISHA: Tighty-whities?
TRAVIS: I'm not answering you.

4335
03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:09.300
MARISHA: Are they, like, huggers?

4336
03:15:09.300 --> 03:15:11.650
I bet they're huggers.
LAURA: I'm going to imagine huggers.

4337
03:15:11.650 --> 03:15:12.692
MARISHA: Yeah, me too.
LIAM: How white

4338
03:15:12.692 --> 03:15:15.547
are tighty-whities in medieval time? Let's be honest.

4339
03:15:15.547 --> 03:15:16.380
ASHLEY: What's a hugger?

4340
03:15:16.380 --> 03:15:18.690
TALIESIN: Deep maroon, I would imagine.
LAURA: Hugger is a set of underwear

4341
03:15:18.690 --> 03:15:20.760
that really hug the testicles.

4342
03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:23.730
MARISHA: All the good parts.
ASHLEY: Oh, hugs-- the testicles?

4343
03:15:23.730 --> 03:15:26.240
LAURA: Or any, you know, whatever parts you have.

4344
03:15:26.240 --> 03:15:28.672
SAM: I think he has testicles, yeah.

4345
03:15:28.672 --> 03:15:32.104
LAURA: Yeah, but for Yasha, if she wanted to wear huggers,

4346
03:15:32.104 --> 03:15:33.457
you know, it would hug her booty.

4347
03:15:33.457 --> 03:15:34.620
ASHLEY: I don't need to wear huggers.

4348
03:15:34.620 --> 03:15:38.260
LAURA: If you wanted to.
MARISHA: Do you rock it camo?

4349
03:15:38.260 --> 03:15:40.868
ASHLEY: I don't understand.
TRAVIS: Did you say "camo"?

4350
03:15:40.868 --> 03:15:42.426
ASHLEY: I have pants on.

4351
03:15:43.520 --> 03:15:45.540
SAM: Yeah, why would you need pants under the pants?

4352
03:15:45.540 --> 03:15:49.483
ASHLEY: What do you need an extra piece for?

4353
03:15:49.483 --> 03:15:50.610
LAURA: That's a really good question.

4354
03:15:50.610 --> 03:15:52.520
I didn't know--
SAM: For when you pee your pants.

4355
03:15:52.520 --> 03:15:57.210
ASHLEY: Like an extra pair of under pants, pants underneath.

4356
03:15:57.210 --> 03:15:59.173
LAURA: I mean, that's technically what they are, yeah.

4357
03:15:59.173 --> 03:16:00.686
TALIESIN: I'm already back to Caleb.

4358
03:16:00.686 --> 03:16:01.832
(laughter)

4359
03:16:01.832 --> 03:16:03.405
LAURA: Man!

4360
03:16:03.405 --> 03:16:05.866
MATT: I'm trying to pinpoint the
exact moment I lost control of this.

4361
03:16:05.866 --> 03:16:06.952
SAM: Put underwear on all of them!

4362
03:16:06.952 --> 03:16:07.785
MATT: It's multiple points.

4363
03:16:07.785 --> 03:16:09.398
LIAM: Five years ago.
MATT: Yeah, true. True.

4364
03:16:09.398 --> 03:16:10.564
TRAVIS: It's been an hour.

4365
03:16:10.564 --> 03:16:12.832
Okay, I hope you've done your best work.

4366
03:16:12.832 --> 03:16:16.112
LAURA: Okay, okay, I've got the pails going.

4367
03:16:16.112 --> 03:16:18.918
MATT: You got some pails, you've arranged some furniture.

4368
03:16:18.918 --> 03:16:20.226
MARISHA: How many ladders?
LAURA: I'm definitely--

4369
03:16:20.226 --> 03:16:22.897
SAM: Pine cones.
MATT: Pine cones.

4370
03:16:24.005 --> 03:16:25.547
SAM: Or large nuts.

4371
03:16:25.547 --> 03:16:27.627
TRAVIS: It's just pineapples.

4372
03:16:27.627 --> 03:16:29.715
LAURA: Whatever kind of--
MATT: Make a stealth check.

4373
03:16:29.715 --> 03:16:31.015
SAM: A stealth check?

4374
03:16:31.015 --> 03:16:32.783
MATT: Correct, because you went outside for this.

4375
03:16:32.783 --> 03:16:33.616
LAURA: Oh!

4376
03:16:33.616 --> 03:16:34.449
SAM: Natural 20!

4377
03:16:34.449 --> 03:16:36.670
LIAM: There's lots of conifers in the jungle.

4378
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:40.170
MATT: You avoid a whole shitton

4379
03:16:40.170 --> 03:16:42.610
of very dangerous creatures that are nocturnal

4380
03:16:42.610 --> 03:16:44.410
and peruse the elements of this jungle

4381
03:16:44.410 --> 03:16:46.360
that you only realize as you're heading your way out.

4382
03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:49.690
Like, we're talking, like, feral owlbears

4383
03:16:49.690 --> 03:16:51.710
and all sorts of other creatures that peruse

4384
03:16:51.710 --> 03:16:53.960
this element of the jungle and...

4385
03:16:56.060 --> 03:16:58.750
There are no pine cones, but you find

4386
03:16:58.750 --> 03:17:02.470
large, weird nuts, acorn-like creatures.

4387
03:17:02.470 --> 03:17:04.788
SAM: Right.
MATT: You know, objects that you were looking for.

4388
03:17:05.804 --> 03:17:09.075
Like soggy, tuber-like...

4389
03:17:10.330 --> 03:17:11.294
TRAVIS: No.
LIAM: No.

4390
03:17:11.294 --> 03:17:13.080
MATT: Things that you can find that have taken root

4391
03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:15.270
on the exterior of the lake.

4392
03:17:15.270 --> 03:17:17.960
All a whole bunch of weird things.

4393
03:17:17.960 --> 03:17:22.035
It looks like a firmer sea cucumber.

4394
03:17:22.035 --> 03:17:24.137
It's awful.
SAM: Great. Great.

4395
03:17:24.137 --> 03:17:27.084
MATT: But you come back with a
satchel of this odd collection

4396
03:17:27.084 --> 03:17:29.850
and you, very much like

4397
03:17:29.850 --> 03:17:32.180
the oddest Santa Claus-- that's twice we've referenced

4398
03:17:32.180 --> 03:17:34.324
Santa Claus in this sequence.

4399
03:17:34.324 --> 03:17:35.630
Go around and just leave little presents

4400
03:17:35.630 --> 03:17:37.413
in everyone's hand--
LAURA: Put one just, like,

4401
03:17:37.413 --> 03:17:40.000
draped across a shoulder.
SAM: Sure, sure.

4402
03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:41.340
And then if there's any left,

4403
03:17:41.340 --> 03:17:44.423
I'll give Gaima

4404
03:17:44.423 --> 03:17:47.440
a little bag full of a bunch of them.

4405
03:17:47.440 --> 03:17:49.682
MATT: There you go, there you go.

4406
03:17:49.682 --> 03:17:50.940
LAURA: That's really good.

4407
03:17:50.940 --> 03:17:53.490
I'm going to watch Nott do all of this

4408
03:17:54.810 --> 03:17:57.409
and I'm going to take out my paints.

4409
03:17:57.409 --> 03:17:59.227
SAM: And dick on her.
MATT: And...?

4410
03:17:59.227 --> 03:18:02.510
LAURA: No, I'm going to draw

4411
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:07.340
a tiny, little statue of the Traveler about this big.

4412
03:18:07.340 --> 03:18:10.213
And I've realized, if I draw it just right--

4413
03:18:10.213 --> 03:18:11.210
SAM: I've seen it.
LAURA: Yes.

4414
03:18:11.210 --> 03:18:13.590
With the hood and the cape.

4415
03:18:14.784 --> 03:18:18.242
You can make a nice little dick out of it.

4416
03:18:18.242 --> 03:18:19.148
SAM: A silhouette.

4417
03:18:19.148 --> 03:18:20.481
LAURA: The silhouette of a dick.

4418
03:18:20.481 --> 03:18:23.180
And then with the cape, I'm going to make it open up

4419
03:18:23.180 --> 03:18:25.510
just a little bit the bottom, so it looks like

4420
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:28.390
the road going up and I'm going to make the archway

4421
03:18:28.390 --> 03:18:31.590
like engraved. I'm going to make it look really beautiful.

4422
03:18:31.590 --> 03:18:35.730
A really pretty dick statue of the Traveler. Yeah.

4423
03:18:36.970 --> 03:18:37.803
And with a little--

4424
03:18:37.803 --> 03:18:39.815
TRAVIS: Your parents watch this show!

4425
03:18:39.815 --> 03:18:42.732
(laughter)

4426
03:18:49.811 --> 03:18:53.310
LAURA: With a little loop on the top so that

4427
03:18:53.310 --> 03:18:57.180
it can be worn as a pendant or whatever.

4428
03:18:57.180 --> 03:18:58.315
MATT: All right.

4429
03:18:58.315 --> 03:18:59.893
(laughter)

4430
03:19:00.885 --> 03:19:02.518
TALIESIN: -- your parents to send us some Mountain Dew.

4431
03:19:02.518 --> 03:19:06.383
LAURA: Yes, and then I'm going to--

4432
03:19:06.383 --> 03:19:07.749
MATT: You do so.

4433
03:19:07.749 --> 03:19:10.340
LAURA: Yes, go up to Nott.

4434
03:19:10.340 --> 03:19:11.515
Nott,

4435
03:19:13.006 --> 03:19:16.360
I don't think I've ever met anyone in my entire life

4436
03:19:16.360 --> 03:19:20.453
that would be as good of a follower of the Traveler as you.

4437
03:19:21.410 --> 03:19:24.692
You're everything he looks for.

4438
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:32.967
SAM: Are you asking me to join your cult?

4439
03:19:32.967 --> 03:19:34.475
LAURA: Well,

4440
03:19:34.475 --> 03:19:38.955
I'm asking you to open your heart to chaos.

4441
03:19:38.955 --> 03:19:41.872
(laughter)

4442
03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:46.790
SAM: All right.

4443
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:48.552
(laughter)

4444
03:19:48.552 --> 03:19:51.379
I will-- you know what?

4445
03:19:52.940 --> 03:19:56.550
When I assume my new form, my old form--

4446
03:19:56.550 --> 03:19:57.860
LAURA: Or whatever you want it to be, really,

4447
03:19:57.860 --> 03:19:59.170
you don't have to go back to your old form

4448
03:19:59.170 --> 03:20:00.650
you could be anything you want.

4449
03:20:00.650 --> 03:20:03.116
SAM: That's true.

4450
03:20:03.116 --> 03:20:08.108
But I will be born again--

4451
03:20:08.108 --> 03:20:09.528
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

4452
03:20:09.528 --> 03:20:14.040
SAM: -- with your faith in my heart

4453
03:20:14.040 --> 03:20:18.620
and we'll see what what happens.

4454
03:20:18.620 --> 03:20:20.120
I can't promise anything

4455
03:20:20.120 --> 03:20:21.810
because I don't know how I'll be.

4456
03:20:21.810 --> 03:20:23.050
LAURA: Totally.
SAM: And also

4457
03:20:23.050 --> 03:20:25.110
I don't think you can promise chaos.

4458
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:26.984
LAURA: No, and yeah.

4459
03:20:26.984 --> 03:20:28.730
If you're if you're not feeling it, that's okay.

4460
03:20:28.730 --> 03:20:32.055
MARISHA: I walk by and I slap the dick out of Nott's hand.

4461
03:20:32.055 --> 03:20:34.719
Ha ha ha! Eyy!
SAM: That was good.

4462
03:20:34.719 --> 03:20:37.910
Chaos Crew!

4463
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:39.970
LAURA: I got to make another fucking necklace.

4464
03:20:39.970 --> 03:20:41.001
SAM: Yeah, you do.

4465
03:20:41.001 --> 03:20:42.500
LAURA: I'll make another fucking necklace

4466
03:20:42.500 --> 03:20:44.870
and give it to Beau.
MARISHA: What?

4467
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:47.710
LAURA: See this?
MARISHA: What?

4468
03:20:47.710 --> 03:20:51.020
LAURA: There's chaos in your heart, I can feel it.

4469
03:20:51.020 --> 03:20:53.220
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Join us.

4470
03:20:53.220 --> 03:20:54.760
MARISHA: What?
LAURA: You know,

4471
03:20:54.760 --> 03:20:56.890
if you want to hang out with the Traveler, too.

4472
03:20:56.890 --> 03:20:59.240
I'm just saying, that you make a really good follower

4473
03:20:59.240 --> 03:21:02.410
of the Traveler, you can-- you know, or if you-- whatever.

4474
03:21:02.410 --> 03:21:06.439
You're chaotic and I love you. There you go.

4475
03:21:06.439 --> 03:21:08.632
MARISHA: You're very attractive right now.

4476
03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:10.970
LAURA: Thank you.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4477
03:21:10.970 --> 03:21:12.330
And I walk away.

4478
03:21:12.330 --> 03:21:13.332
MATT: Okay.

4479
03:21:14.905 --> 03:21:16.040
TALIESIN: Get some sleep, Caleb.

4480
03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:18.660
We may need to teleport in morning.

4481
03:21:18.660 --> 03:21:21.967
LIAM: Okay, I'll prepare that one, but I'm busy right now.

4482
03:21:21.967 --> 03:21:23.750
MATT: So Caleb, what have you been working on?

4483
03:21:23.750 --> 03:21:27.330
LIAM: I have been-- I cast Fortune's Favor on myself

4484
03:21:27.330 --> 03:21:30.730
and I have been trying to figure out how to control

4485
03:21:30.730 --> 03:21:35.070
or adjust or use this collar from

4486
03:21:35.070 --> 03:21:37.270
within the Archmage's Bane

4487
03:21:37.270 --> 03:21:39.230
that got locked around his neck because

4488
03:21:39.230 --> 03:21:41.890
I want to be able to use it, still.

4489
03:21:41.890 --> 03:21:43.540
MATT: Okay, roll an arcana check for me.

4490
03:21:43.540 --> 03:21:47.590
LIAM: Fortune's Favor. Fortune's Favor.

4491
03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:50.873
Two 16s, 26.
MATT: 26, okay.

4492
03:21:54.784 --> 03:21:58.000
These collars themselves, they aren't self-powered.

4493
03:21:58.000 --> 03:21:59.730
They are connected intrinsically

4494
03:21:59.730 --> 03:22:03.970
to the energies that are harnessed in the center tower,

4495
03:22:03.970 --> 03:22:08.120
the machine tower of Halas' realm.

4496
03:22:08.120 --> 03:22:12.650
So this has no power source.

4497
03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:14.850
It could be experimented with or another power source

4498
03:22:14.850 --> 03:22:19.370
that could be attached to it to attempt to have it function.

4499
03:22:19.370 --> 03:22:21.500
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: But you're not entirely

4500
03:22:21.500 --> 03:22:25.710
certain what could function for that

4501
03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:28.310
in the moment. It could be experimented with.

4502
03:22:28.310 --> 03:22:29.717
LIAM: Sure.
MATT: But you do ascertain

4503
03:22:29.717 --> 03:22:31.780
with that roll that that's really all

4504
03:22:31.780 --> 03:22:33.100
that it's missing is a power source

4505
03:22:33.100 --> 03:22:34.290
that's strong enough to keep it going.

4506
03:22:34.290 --> 03:22:36.290
LIAM: I understand something that I did not before.

4507
03:22:36.290 --> 03:22:37.130
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Excellent.

4508
03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:38.340
MATT: And a high roll was how you're able

4509
03:22:38.340 --> 03:22:39.250
to look at it like, oh,

4510
03:22:39.250 --> 03:22:40.083
this can totally be powered.

4511
03:22:40.083 --> 03:22:41.460
Again, I can see how this can be rooted in here

4512
03:22:41.460 --> 03:22:44.360
and how, you know, the actual enchantment functions.

4513
03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:50.363
But, yeah, I mean, (stammering)

4514
03:22:50.363 --> 03:22:52.138
there are a number of things

4515
03:22:52.138 --> 03:22:55.390
that could be utilized,

4516
03:22:55.390 --> 03:22:56.665
but you have none of those things

4517
03:22:56.665 --> 03:22:58.419
at your disposal at the moment.

4518
03:22:58.419 --> 03:22:59.750
LIAM: So once I have decided on that,

4519
03:22:59.750 --> 03:23:01.890
I just stare at it for 10 to 15 minutes.

4520
03:23:03.970 --> 03:23:04.960
And that's it.
MATT: Okay.

4521
03:23:04.960 --> 03:23:06.390
You said you were going to find Caleb?

4522
03:23:06.390 --> 03:23:09.240
TALIESIN: I'm just letting him know
and then I'm just passing out.

4523
03:23:09.240 --> 03:23:10.600
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I know you still need

4524
03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:12.500
some sort of 1.21 gigawatts power source.

4525
03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:15.587
LIAM: You want to you want to leave tomorrow?

4526
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:21.910
TALIESIN: Would it be possible to
get my family back home and then?

4527
03:23:22.950 --> 03:23:26.320
LIAM: Home, home. To your home?

4528
03:23:26.320 --> 03:23:27.260
TALIESIN: Could we teleport there?

4529
03:23:27.260 --> 03:23:29.390
LIAM: No, well, I cannot do that,

4530
03:23:29.390 --> 03:23:31.468
I could get us to our friend who can

4531
03:23:31.468 --> 03:23:36.468
or it might take an extra step. I can't go direct.

4532
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:39.720
MATT: The closest you can get them is Zadash.

4533
03:23:41.740 --> 03:23:43.470
Or Rexxentrum.

4534
03:23:43.470 --> 03:23:44.920
LIAM: Feeling good?

4535
03:23:44.920 --> 03:23:47.642
TALIESIN: Get them close enough
that it's an easy journey for them

4536
03:23:47.642 --> 03:23:50.590
and then we can get on our way.

4537
03:23:50.590 --> 03:23:52.140
LIAM: Yeah.

4538
03:23:52.140 --> 03:23:55.500
TALIESIN: To back to the Menagerie Coast.

4539
03:23:55.500 --> 03:24:00.500
LIAM: I have an idea to help your family member.

4540
03:24:00.510 --> 03:24:03.000
The one who's in pieces still, I'm sorry.

4541
03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:04.470
TALIESIN: That's okay.

4542
03:24:04.470 --> 03:24:06.370
LIAM: But I don't think it's a lost cause.

4543
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:08.583
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4544
03:24:09.866 --> 03:24:12.864
I appreciate that.
LIAM: All the same.

4545
03:24:15.140 --> 03:24:17.950
Not that I understand much, but congratulations

4546
03:24:17.950 --> 03:24:19.860
on making it this far.

4547
03:24:21.230 --> 03:24:22.063
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4548
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:27.712
See you in the morning.
LIAM: <i>Gute nacht.</i>

4549
03:24:29.968 --> 03:24:31.710
TALIESIN: And I fall asleep wet.

4550
03:24:31.710 --> 03:24:34.068
MATT: Okay.

4551
03:24:34.068 --> 03:24:37.400
I immediately looked to Laura Bailey for that.

4552
03:24:37.400 --> 03:24:41.050
All right, a long rest comes to you all.

4553
03:24:44.404 --> 03:24:45.887
TALIESIN: Rough!

4554
03:24:48.210 --> 03:24:50.545
MATT: In the morning, since you guys went to bed

4555
03:24:50.545 --> 03:24:53.340
later than others, there's already been activity

4556
03:24:53.340 --> 03:24:55.880
within the Cave of Remembrance.

4557
03:24:55.880 --> 03:24:57.090
And as you awaken...

4558
03:24:59.620 --> 03:25:02.157
you can see, you can smell

4559
03:25:02.157 --> 03:25:05.130
a simple breakfast has been prepared

4560
03:25:05.130 --> 03:25:09.540
and the majority of your family that has been restored,

4561
03:25:09.540 --> 03:25:13.330
as well as Eremis, await your arrival.

4562
03:25:15.130 --> 03:25:18.182
You can see they've moved

4563
03:25:18.182 --> 03:25:22.595
two figures into a central area.

4564
03:25:22.595 --> 03:25:27.595
One of which was the Gaima figure

4565
03:25:28.260 --> 03:25:31.735
and the other looks to be

4566
03:25:31.735 --> 03:25:34.378
Mecatoth Stone as well.

4567
03:25:35.349 --> 03:25:37.059
That was pulled from the outside.

4568
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:42.110
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
MATT: But

4569
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:43.650
as you guys awaken and gather

4570
03:25:43.650 --> 03:25:47.573
in Eremis greets. Says, "Good morning,

4571
03:25:47.573 --> 03:25:51.833
"I hope rest was what you were looking for.

4572
03:25:52.940 --> 03:25:56.660
"Who's the one capable of-- ah, yes,

4573
03:25:56.660 --> 03:25:58.950
"either one. Whoever, please,

4574
03:25:58.950 --> 03:26:01.116
"if you could tend to Gaima."

4575
03:26:01.116 --> 03:26:03.380
LAURA: You do one, I'll do the other.
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4576
03:26:03.380 --> 03:26:04.770
LAURA: One, two, three, go.

4577
03:26:04.770 --> 03:26:06.507
Let's see who does it faster.

4578
03:26:06.507 --> 03:26:07.773
I think I got it.

4579
03:26:07.773 --> 03:26:10.958
TALIESIN: You definitely did. I was confused.

4580
03:26:10.958 --> 03:26:11.923
Okay.

4581
03:26:11.923 --> 03:26:12.756
MATT: Okay.

4582
03:26:14.343 --> 03:26:17.390
We'll say you head to Mecatoth,

4583
03:26:17.390 --> 03:26:19.640
which is the dragonborn figure

4584
03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:21.510
just been brought inside.

4585
03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:26.300
As the stone fades away, it reveals green scales.

4586
03:26:26.300 --> 03:26:28.970
These beautiful, vibrant green scales.

4587
03:26:28.970 --> 03:26:33.612
This very thin, lithe

4588
03:26:33.612 --> 03:26:37.575
dragonborn with a long tail that comes up under the robe.

4589
03:26:37.575 --> 03:26:39.251
As it restores, goes,

4590
03:26:39.251 --> 03:26:41.954
"(groaning) Uh?"

4591
03:26:41.954 --> 03:26:44.420
TALIESIN: Welcome back from the Clay family.

4592
03:26:44.420 --> 03:26:45.810
It's been a long time.

4593
03:26:45.810 --> 03:26:47.835
MATT: "What's happening? This is weird."

4594
03:26:47.835 --> 03:26:50.100
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

4595
03:26:50.100 --> 03:26:52.487
MATT: "What happened to everybody?"

4596
03:26:52.487 --> 03:26:53.857
"Oh no!"
MARISHA: Mecatoth.

4597
03:26:53.857 --> 03:26:55.263
LAURA: Megatoth.
MATT: "Oh, this is a problem."

4598
03:26:55.263 --> 03:26:57.018
LAURA: Oh no, Steve Blum--

4599
03:26:57.018 --> 03:26:59.902
(laughter)
on helium.

4600
03:27:02.140 --> 03:27:05.588
TALIESIN: It's been a while and there's much work to do.

4601
03:27:06.430 --> 03:27:08.338
Questions will be answered later.
MATT: "Yeah, I think you can

4602
03:27:08.338 --> 03:27:09.630
"definitely say that again.

4603
03:27:09.630 --> 03:27:12.020
"The Clay family, you said?"

4604
03:27:12.020 --> 03:27:14.390
TALIESIN: We're-- many of us are here.

4605
03:27:14.390 --> 03:27:16.180
SAM: He looks just like Fjord.

4606
03:27:16.180 --> 03:27:19.525
MATT: "Welcome, Clay family to the--"

4607
03:27:19.525 --> 03:27:23.520
At which point, Jester has finished restoring Gaima,

4608
03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:27.925
this massive goliath half-giant,

4609
03:27:30.060 --> 03:27:34.858
middle aged, hair completely shorn

4610
03:27:34.858 --> 03:27:38.080
with these beautiful tattoos of curling vines

4611
03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:39.710
that come up from underneath the neck

4612
03:27:39.710 --> 03:27:42.340
and wrap around and frame the eyes and go up to the top

4613
03:27:42.340 --> 03:27:45.306
and then spiral to the back of the head.

4614
03:27:45.306 --> 03:27:47.778
She has this heavy fur around

4615
03:27:47.778 --> 03:27:49.857
the collar and this sleeveless vest

4616
03:27:49.857 --> 03:27:51.682
that drags to the ground.

4617
03:27:51.682 --> 03:27:53.930
These thick bracers and a staff

4618
03:27:53.930 --> 03:27:58.271
and as she's restored, there's this moment of recognition.

4619
03:27:58.271 --> 03:27:59.104
"Ah!

4620
03:28:00.880 --> 03:28:04.208
"I do not know you, but I'm thankful

4621
03:28:05.696 --> 03:28:08.895
"for this gift of renewal."

4622
03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:13.730
LAURA: (mysteriously) Welcome back to the world

4623
03:28:13.730 --> 03:28:16.612
of the living.

4624
03:28:16.612 --> 03:28:18.394
(laughter)

4625
03:28:18.394 --> 03:28:19.990
TALIESIN: This is why you should've
gotten eight hours of sleep.

4626
03:28:19.990 --> 03:28:21.700
LAURA: I know, I know, we kind of--

4627
03:28:22.620 --> 03:28:25.750
(mysteriously) You have been missed greatly.

4628
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:28.180
MATT: "Well, I thank you,"

4629
03:28:28.180 --> 03:28:29.500
and she takes your hand.

4630
03:28:29.500 --> 03:28:32.580
"What is your name?"
LAURA: Jester.

4631
03:28:32.580 --> 03:28:35.660
MATT: "Jester, may the Mother keep you."

4632
03:28:35.660 --> 03:28:39.976
LAURA: And may she always give you plenty

4633
03:28:39.976 --> 03:28:41.728
of milk.

4634
03:28:41.728 --> 03:28:43.179
(laughter)

4635
03:28:43.179 --> 03:28:44.754
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

4636
03:28:46.010 --> 03:28:47.900
MATT: "Thank you."

4637
03:28:47.900 --> 03:28:49.450
LAURA: You're welcome.

4638
03:28:49.450 --> 03:28:51.030
Did I say that right? Is that something that's--

4639
03:28:51.030 --> 03:28:53.249
MATT: Both of you turn away, to look the other way

4640
03:28:53.249 --> 03:28:56.951
and Gaima's like, "Milk, that's interesting."
TALIESIN: I've never heard anyone say any of that before.

4641
03:28:56.951 --> 03:28:58.212
MATT: "All right."

4642
03:28:58.212 --> 03:28:59.840
TRAVIS: (laughing) Milk?!

4643
03:28:59.840 --> 03:29:04.825
MATT: "Eremis." He goes, "Yes, we've had a bit of

4644
03:29:06.289 --> 03:29:09.250
a Miskath gorgon problem.

4645
03:29:09.250 --> 03:29:13.510
But these individuals have kindly eliminated

4646
03:29:13.510 --> 03:29:16.230
the creature and are aiding us

4647
03:29:16.230 --> 03:29:20.240
in restoring our fine cave and its denizens."

4648
03:29:21.140 --> 03:29:24.316
(as Gaima) "Oh, well thank you, everyone."

4649
03:29:24.316 --> 03:29:26.490
You can see behind, Mecathoth's like,

4650
03:29:26.490 --> 03:29:30.573
"Yeah, looks like we got our work cut out for us.

4651
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:35.070
"I guess I'll start with...

4652
03:29:35.070 --> 03:29:36.800
"I'll start with the front side of the cave,"

4653
03:29:36.800 --> 03:29:40.060
and hobbles over with this large gait

4654
03:29:40.060 --> 03:29:41.860
from these longer than natural legs

4655
03:29:41.860 --> 03:29:43.520
shifting into the back.

4656
03:29:43.520 --> 03:29:45.493
And this is you get the sense that

4657
03:29:46.776 --> 03:29:48.450
the Clay family is an odd mixture,

4658
03:29:48.450 --> 03:29:51.420
the Stone family, also an odd mixture of personalities.

4659
03:29:51.420 --> 03:29:52.950
TALIESIN: I'm going to go over

4660
03:29:52.950 --> 03:29:56.080
and tap Colton and Clarabelle.

4661
03:29:56.080 --> 03:29:58.680
Clarabelle and Colton, in that order.

4662
03:29:58.680 --> 03:30:01.256
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Just to

4663
03:30:01.256 --> 03:30:03.770
get everyone other than--
LAURA: Who else should I hit?

4664
03:30:05.030 --> 03:30:07.348
TALIESIN: Do we need--
LAURA: Maybe I'll ask Gaima that.

4665
03:30:07.348 --> 03:30:09.848
TALIESIN: Do we need Jester for your plan?

4666
03:30:12.880 --> 03:30:15.312
LAURA: What?
LIAM: Well, we are still working on that.

4667
03:30:15.312 --> 03:30:18.540
I'm taking of Caduceus'--
TALIESIN: Of my Aunt Corrin.

4668
03:30:18.540 --> 03:30:19.400
LIAM: Yeah.

4669
03:30:19.400 --> 03:30:21.690
SAM: We should save one spell.

4670
03:30:21.690 --> 03:30:23.470
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4671
03:30:23.470 --> 03:30:27.770
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was thinking about it also.

4672
03:30:27.770 --> 03:30:30.510
Okay, so I can bring one person back, but also,

4673
03:30:30.510 --> 03:30:32.840
I think I will, I want to try something

4674
03:30:32.840 --> 03:30:34.520
if you think it would work.

4675
03:30:34.520 --> 03:30:35.570
TALIESIN: I don't know what you're thinking

4676
03:30:35.570 --> 03:30:36.970
I'm not sure if it would work.

4677
03:30:36.970 --> 03:30:37.960
LAURA: Well, okay.

4678
03:30:37.960 --> 03:30:39.767
I was thinking about what spells I have, right?

4679
03:30:39.767 --> 03:30:40.600
TALIESIN: Uh-huh.

4680
03:30:40.600 --> 03:30:45.063
LAURA: And we can shape stone.

4681
03:30:47.910 --> 03:30:49.610
TALIESIN: I don't know if that would work.

4682
03:30:52.740 --> 03:30:55.740
LAURA: What if we put them together
and then we stone shaped?

4683
03:30:55.740 --> 03:30:57.330
TALIESIN: I can't stone shape today.

4684
03:30:57.330 --> 03:31:00.315
LAURA: But I can because I thought about it.

4685
03:31:01.800 --> 03:31:03.202
TALIESIN: If want to try.

4686
03:31:05.100 --> 03:31:06.709
What do you think, Caleb?

4687
03:31:06.709 --> 03:31:07.984
LAURA: Do you think that would work?

4688
03:31:07.984 --> 03:31:10.556
LIAM: I am not an expert on this.

4689
03:31:10.556 --> 03:31:14.130
I'm not sure that my idea is foolproof.

4690
03:31:14.130 --> 03:31:15.830
So--
TALIESIN: Nothing's foolproof.

4691
03:31:17.046 --> 03:31:18.471
SAM: I think it will.

4692
03:31:19.360 --> 03:31:20.193
LAURA: Really?

4693
03:31:20.193 --> 03:31:21.990
SAM: I have the faith of the Traveler behind me.

4694
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:25.470
LAURA: Hey.
MARISHA: Wait, what is that true?

4695
03:31:25.470 --> 03:31:28.200
LAURA: So do you, Beau. So do you.
MARISHA: Wait.

4696
03:31:28.200 --> 03:31:30.470
Did I say something last night?

4697
03:31:30.470 --> 03:31:32.500
ASHLEY: Wait, you became a follower of the Traveler

4698
03:31:32.500 --> 03:31:35.377
after meeting him, the guy?
SAM: Well, we're going to wait and see.

4699
03:31:35.377 --> 03:31:36.350
SAM: No, no,

4700
03:31:36.350 --> 03:31:38.010
it's more of a favor of Jester--

4701
03:31:38.010 --> 03:31:39.751
LAURA: What?

4702
03:31:39.751 --> 03:31:40.584
SAM: For now.

4703
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:42.343
LAURA: I'll take it.

4704
03:31:42.343 --> 03:31:45.250
TALIESIN: I'm going to wake up my siblings.

4705
03:31:45.250 --> 03:31:47.580
MATT: As you go over to Clarabelle, who is...

4706
03:31:49.020 --> 03:31:51.720
you can see visibly younger than Caduceus.

4707
03:31:52.760 --> 03:31:56.210
Looks to be probably in the mid-teens,

4708
03:31:58.220 --> 03:32:00.463
bright eyed,

4709
03:32:02.380 --> 03:32:06.390
stringy long hair that goes past the shoulders.

4710
03:32:07.260 --> 03:32:09.082
Immediately at first glance, is

4711
03:32:09.082 --> 03:32:11.656
the wild child of the family.

4712
03:32:11.656 --> 03:32:13.910
Ironically, we were making Nell references earlier.

4713
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:15.710
This is definitely probably one

4714
03:32:15.710 --> 03:32:19.750
of the unkept wild kid the of the family.

4715
03:32:19.750 --> 03:32:22.240
As soon as she's restored, she goes, "(gasps)

4716
03:32:23.230 --> 03:32:24.063
"Caduceus?"

4717
03:32:25.031 --> 03:32:30.031
TALIESIN: Hey, hey, hey, hey Belle, hi.

4718
03:32:30.210 --> 03:32:32.144
MARISHA: Hay bale. (chuckles)

4719
03:32:32.144 --> 03:32:36.190
MATT: "How? What happened? Who are-- (sputtering)"

4720
03:32:36.190 --> 03:32:37.440
Looks around to see everybody's stone.

4721
03:32:38.920 --> 03:32:40.307
"I'm confused."

4722
03:32:41.540 --> 03:32:43.235
TALIESIN: Mom and Dad will fill you in,

4723
03:32:43.235 --> 03:32:45.724
it's been a weird decade. Hold on,

4724
03:32:45.724 --> 03:32:48.624
let me deal with this guy.

4725
03:32:48.624 --> 03:32:50.470
LAURA: Does he look, like, super old compared

4726
03:32:50.470 --> 03:32:53.740
to how you remember him?

4727
03:32:55.240 --> 03:32:56.073
MATT: "I mean."

4728
03:32:58.050 --> 03:33:01.370
TALIESIN: Hair's a little stringy.
MATT: "Yeah, it's lost a lot of its color, too.

4729
03:33:01.370 --> 03:33:03.274
"How old are you now?"

4730
03:33:03.274 --> 03:33:06.747
LAURA: 200 years old.

4731
03:33:06.747 --> 03:33:09.949
(laughter)

4732
03:33:11.241 --> 03:33:14.457
MATT: You see Clarabelle's like--
TALIESIN: Literally grabs Jester

4733
03:33:14.457 --> 03:33:16.970
and very gently--

4734
03:33:16.970 --> 03:33:17.803
I'm not--

4735
03:33:19.160 --> 03:33:21.150
Been about 10 years, apparently,

4736
03:33:21.150 --> 03:33:24.465
eight years since or seven since you left.

4737
03:33:24.465 --> 03:33:25.990
LAURA: Maybe six.
TALIESIN: It's been 10 years

4738
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:29.840
since Mom left, so it's it's been a while.

4739
03:33:29.840 --> 03:33:31.648
TRAVIS: ♪ It's been awhile ♪

4740
03:33:31.648 --> 03:33:33.064
TALIESIN: Let's hold on.

4741
03:33:33.064 --> 03:33:37.110
I got to do this. And I'm going to wake up Colton.

4742
03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:38.850
MATT: So Colton, who has his hand back and was

4743
03:33:38.850 --> 03:33:41.230
in a protective position for Clarabelle.

4744
03:33:41.230 --> 03:33:43.337
Immediately goes like, "Stay back.

4745
03:33:43.337 --> 03:33:46.254
"(breathes heavily)

4746
03:33:47.191 --> 03:33:48.024
"Oh.

4747
03:33:51.170 --> 03:33:53.147
"Hello."

4748
03:33:54.530 --> 03:33:56.610
TALIESIN: Welcome back.

4749
03:33:56.610 --> 03:33:57.610
SAM: Everything's okay.

4750
03:33:59.280 --> 03:34:03.060
TALIESIN: Mom and Dad are in the other room.

4751
03:34:03.060 --> 03:34:04.815
It's been while.

4752
03:34:04.815 --> 03:34:06.757
ALL: (muttering) ♪ It's been awhile ♪

4753
03:34:06.757 --> 03:34:07.590
TALIESIN: Love you guys.

4754
03:34:09.260 --> 03:34:11.142
MATT: "Did you save me?"

4755
03:34:11.142 --> 03:34:12.325
TALIESIN: Sure.

4756
03:34:13.660 --> 03:34:15.262
MATT: "Damn it."

4757
03:34:15.262 --> 03:34:16.095
TALIESIN: Yep.

4758
03:34:17.816 --> 03:34:19.195
MARISHA: Oh.
MATT: Looks back

4759
03:34:19.195 --> 03:34:22.322
and sees Clarabelle and he goes,

4760
03:34:22.322 --> 03:34:23.520
"You okay?"

4761
03:34:23.520 --> 03:34:27.587
She goes, "Um, yeah, Caduceus saved me."

4762
03:34:27.587 --> 03:34:30.440
He's like, "(sighs)"

4763
03:34:30.440 --> 03:34:31.900
TALIESIN: Think about that.

4764
03:34:31.900 --> 03:34:36.867
I'm going to turn and head back to
where we're figuring out Corrin.

4765
03:34:38.520 --> 03:34:39.893
MATT: Yeah, they follow behind

4766
03:34:39.893 --> 03:34:41.058
and they start scattering to go find

4767
03:34:41.058 --> 03:34:42.924
your parents off as well.

4768
03:34:44.440 --> 03:34:48.920
Slowly other people start coming back

4769
03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:53.530
and you get the sense that with Mecathoth

4770
03:34:53.530 --> 03:34:58.530
and Gaima revived, over time, weeks

4771
03:34:58.800 --> 03:35:03.800
and weeks on, they can probably work towards restoring

4772
03:35:04.653 --> 03:35:06.612
the entirety of the Oasis itself.

4773
03:35:06.612 --> 03:35:07.795
LAURA: That's great.

4774
03:35:08.660 --> 03:35:11.862
TALIESIN: Let's see what we can do for Corrin.

4775
03:35:12.770 --> 03:35:17.020
LAURA: Let's ask Gaima. Maybe she has an idea for, you know.

4776
03:35:17.020 --> 03:35:19.565
I can ask her if she thinks-- Gaima.

4777
03:35:20.627 --> 03:35:22.820
MATT: As you approach, you can see Gaima

4778
03:35:22.820 --> 03:35:24.450
is now working with a couple of other figures

4779
03:35:24.450 --> 03:35:26.480
that she's restored and they're currently gathering

4780
03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:30.490
the broken pieces of some of the individuals that have,

4781
03:35:32.717 --> 03:35:36.680
were found shattered and they're just saying quiet prayers

4782
03:35:36.680 --> 03:35:39.357
as they gather them up into piles.

4783
03:35:39.357 --> 03:35:40.565
LAURA: Oh.

4784
03:35:40.565 --> 03:35:44.990
MATT: She turns around. "Yes, you asked for me."

4785
03:35:44.990 --> 03:35:47.600
LAURA: Yeah, well it has to do with...

4786
03:35:50.350 --> 03:35:52.770
Do think that when they're broken,

4787
03:35:52.770 --> 03:35:56.120
they can't be mended?

4788
03:35:56.120 --> 03:35:57.561
MATT: "At a certain point,

4789
03:35:57.561 --> 03:36:00.744
"it's a bit beyond our capabilities."

4790
03:36:00.744 --> 03:36:04.012
LAURA: But if you put all the pieces back together and...

4791
03:36:06.130 --> 03:36:08.978
MATT: She looks down at the hundreds of shattered pieces

4792
03:36:08.978 --> 03:36:11.440
in this pile and goes,

4793
03:36:11.440 --> 03:36:13.500
"There are good many things

4794
03:36:13.500 --> 03:36:15.690
"I am quite capable of.

4795
03:36:16.840 --> 03:36:18.670
"Puzzles are not my forte."

4796
03:36:19.705 --> 03:36:21.540
LAURA: I'm really good at puzzles.

4797
03:36:21.540 --> 03:36:23.560
MATT: "Would you like to give it a try?"

4798
03:36:23.560 --> 03:36:25.650
LAURA: How many people are in these piles?

4799
03:36:25.650 --> 03:36:27.850
MATT: "I don't know."

4800
03:36:27.850 --> 03:36:29.884
LAURA: That makes it difficult.

4801
03:36:30.734 --> 03:36:34.040
What if I had the puzzle that I knew was just one person?

4802
03:36:34.940 --> 03:36:36.656
MATT: "Oh, you'd probably have an easier time,

4803
03:36:36.656 --> 03:36:38.440
"that's for sure."

4804
03:36:38.440 --> 03:36:42.040
LAURA: Do you think all we would have to do

4805
03:36:42.040 --> 03:36:45.020
is stick the stone back together

4806
03:36:45.020 --> 03:36:46.720
and then we could bring them back?

4807
03:36:48.509 --> 03:36:50.309
MATT: "Um.

4808
03:36:52.230 --> 03:36:55.438
"I've not attempted such a ritual before.

4809
03:36:55.438 --> 03:36:59.870
"I would hope that if you do it

4810
03:36:59.870 --> 03:37:02.495
"just perfectly right,

4811
03:37:02.495 --> 03:37:05.294
"but this is new territory

4812
03:37:05.294 --> 03:37:07.100
"for myself as well."

4813
03:37:10.610 --> 03:37:12.680
LAURA: Hey, Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah.

4814
03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:14.650
LAURA: What if we bring her back and, like,

4815
03:37:14.650 --> 03:37:18.500
her organs are wrong, and she's in a lot of pain.

4816
03:37:18.500 --> 03:37:22.023
LIAM: Well, she feels nothing at the moment.

4817
03:37:23.640 --> 03:37:26.830
We should try something.
LAURA: Yeah.

4818
03:37:26.830 --> 03:37:30.413
The alternative is the void.

4819
03:37:30.413 --> 03:37:31.670
LAURA: True.

4820
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:33.450
I can try Stone Shape.

4821
03:37:33.450 --> 03:37:34.780
Should I give it a go?

4822
03:37:34.780 --> 03:37:38.560
SAM: Maybe have Caduceus nearby to do healing immediately.

4823
03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:39.620
LAURA: After we bring her back.

4824
03:37:39.620 --> 03:37:41.250
SAM: If she starts screaming horribly.

4825
03:37:41.250 --> 03:37:44.150
LAURA: That's a good idea, right?
TALIESIN: I'll be there.

4826
03:37:44.150 --> 03:37:46.075
LIAM: Are you going to

4827
03:37:46.075 --> 03:37:50.625
Stone Shape her form together,

4828
03:37:50.625 --> 03:37:53.678
or are we sprinkling little stones in?
LAURA: I was thinking

4829
03:37:53.678 --> 03:37:55.690
we can sprinkle in some little stones

4830
03:37:55.690 --> 03:37:58.510
and seal it up.
TALIESIN: That's not going to work,

4831
03:37:58.510 --> 03:38:00.690
I don't think. It's not real stone.

4832
03:38:03.903 --> 03:38:07.600
SAM: Well, it is real stone.
TALIESIN: It's petrified.

4833
03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:11.651
It's a petrified body, that's-- it's--

4834
03:38:11.651 --> 03:38:13.600
TRAVIS: Petrified people.
TALIESIN: It's different.

4835
03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:17.715
LIAM: I don't know. My idea is to, with help--

4836
03:38:17.715 --> 03:38:22.509
I am not a worker of metals,

4837
03:38:22.509 --> 03:38:27.509
but to try to fill this seam seamlessly

4838
03:38:27.700 --> 03:38:30.530
and I can turn that to stone.

4839
03:38:30.530 --> 03:38:33.638
But again, no guarantees, nothing's foolproof.

4840
03:38:33.638 --> 03:38:35.880
But we should try something because.

4841
03:38:35.880 --> 03:38:37.530
TALIESIN: I don't know putting something

4842
03:38:37.530 --> 03:38:40.700
that isn't her--
LAURA: Maybe I can

4843
03:38:40.700 --> 03:38:43.420
just try putting it back together

4844
03:38:43.420 --> 03:38:47.580
with the body as-is and I don't add any extra weird stuff.

4845
03:38:47.580 --> 03:38:49.590
SAM: You can just use your stone shaping

4846
03:38:49.590 --> 03:38:52.060
to sort of smooth the edges.
LAURA: Seal it up.

4847
03:38:52.060 --> 03:38:54.000
SAM: Just like tuck them together.

4848
03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:55.370
LAURA: Yeah, let's give that a go.

4849
03:38:55.370 --> 03:38:57.245
We're going to try that.

4850
03:38:57.245 --> 03:38:59.145
MATT: So what are-- so?

4851
03:38:59.145 --> 03:39:01.087
LIAM: Well, I have to bring it out.

4852
03:39:01.087 --> 03:39:04.421
So he sets his five pieces of amber

4853
03:39:04.421 --> 03:39:07.080
into a rough circle on the ground.

4854
03:39:08.720 --> 03:39:11.570
10 minutes later, he mutters the word "Una,"

4855
03:39:11.570 --> 03:39:16.568
and suddenly the circle flashes and all the parts

4856
03:39:16.568 --> 03:39:20.240
as assembled are there in this circle.

4857
03:39:20.240 --> 03:39:21.073
LAURA: Okay.

4858
03:39:23.100 --> 03:39:27.015
MATT: The rest of the Clay family steps up

4859
03:39:27.015 --> 03:39:29.220
and puts hands on each other's shoulders,

4860
03:39:29.220 --> 03:39:31.287
looking down to watch.

4861
03:39:33.409 --> 03:39:36.330
SAM: I will Levitate the body up just at your

4862
03:39:36.330 --> 03:39:38.430
waist level.
LAURA: Oh, so I can see it on all sides.

4863
03:39:38.430 --> 03:39:39.780
That's smart, that's smart.

4864
03:39:40.640 --> 03:39:43.490
Okay, and I'm going to cast Stone Shape.

4865
03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:45.233
MATT: Okay.

4866
03:39:46.090 --> 03:39:50.292
LAURA: To try to heal the stone together.

4867
03:39:51.630 --> 03:39:52.553
MATT: Okay.

4868
03:39:52.553 --> 03:39:53.794
TALIESIN: Be an artist.

4869
03:39:58.380 --> 03:40:00.570
MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check for me.

4870
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:04.452
LIAM: Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

4871
03:40:05.800 --> 03:40:07.525
Don't rush in.

4872
03:40:09.450 --> 03:40:11.000
Places the pearl in front of her head.

4873
03:40:13.100 --> 03:40:16.066
Very carefully, Jester.
LAURA: Okay.

4874
03:40:16.066 --> 03:40:18.124
LIAM: Very carefully.
TALIESIN: Guidance.

4875
03:40:23.513 --> 03:40:25.420
LAURA: (displeased exhale)

4876
03:40:25.420 --> 03:40:27.145
SAM: That's a one.

4877
03:40:29.053 --> 03:40:31.281
Better.
TALIESIN: And the--

4878
03:40:31.281 --> 03:40:33.970
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

4879
03:40:33.970 --> 03:40:35.587
LAURA: 25.

4880
03:40:35.587 --> 03:40:36.760
(laughter)

4881
03:40:36.760 --> 03:40:39.040
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

4882
03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:41.690
TALIESIN: Medicine's real high.
LAURA: Yeah, I've got good medicine.

4883
03:40:42.740 --> 03:40:45.323
MATT: Natural one would've been real bad.
LAURA: Yeah.

4884
03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:47.830
MATT: Okay.

4885
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:51.710
As you focus, the portions of the body levitating,

4886
03:40:51.710 --> 03:40:55.030
you push them all together and you begin to concentrate.

4887
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:58.340
The body rotates continuously

4888
03:40:58.340 --> 03:41:01.180
as you mold over and smooth each element

4889
03:41:01.180 --> 03:41:03.580
of the fractured elements of the body.

4890
03:41:03.580 --> 03:41:05.272
There are pieces missing.

4891
03:41:06.320 --> 03:41:09.810
You attempt to fill those gaps with the existing material.

4892
03:41:10.650 --> 03:41:12.430
LAURA: I don't want to do it too much.

4893
03:41:12.430 --> 03:41:15.610
MATT: Right, but finding it in ways where you think,

4894
03:41:15.610 --> 03:41:17.476
at the very least, it should

4895
03:41:17.476 --> 03:41:21.042
have a cohesive, continuous body.

4896
03:41:22.580 --> 03:41:25.280
Carefully doing so, like a mystical surgeon,

4897
03:41:25.280 --> 03:41:27.970
you just move your fingers across each of these lines

4898
03:41:27.970 --> 03:41:30.150
as it rotates and you watch as they seal

4899
03:41:30.150 --> 03:41:32.870
and seal and seal and seal past

4900
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:34.670
that you're smoothing fresh pottery.

4901
03:41:39.730 --> 03:41:43.000
The crowd gathers,

4902
03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:46.930
those who have been restored, around to watch

4903
03:41:46.930 --> 03:41:49.570
as you finish the final details on it.

4904
03:41:50.840 --> 03:41:54.157
And with that, the body is seemingly solid.

4905
03:41:56.060 --> 03:41:58.736
LAURA: Okay, Nott, you should lower her back down.

4906
03:41:58.736 --> 03:42:02.561
SAM: All right. Set her down gently.

4907
03:42:02.561 --> 03:42:03.958
Face down. No.

4908
03:42:03.958 --> 03:42:06.210
(laughter)

4909
03:42:06.210 --> 03:42:08.632
LAURA: And then I'm going to use my second 5th-level

4910
03:42:08.632 --> 03:42:10.610
to cast Greater Restoration on the body.

4911
03:42:10.610 --> 03:42:12.735
Get ready to heal, Caduceus.

4912
03:42:12.735 --> 03:42:14.210
MATT: Okay.

4913
03:42:15.150 --> 03:42:20.150
You put your hands onto Corrin's stone form

4914
03:42:20.300 --> 03:42:24.880
and you feel the warm pulse

4915
03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:27.280
of the divine energy, granted to you

4916
03:42:27.280 --> 03:42:31.020
by the Traveler, pass into the stone body.

4917
03:42:31.020 --> 03:42:33.130
From the points of contact where her fingers touch,

4918
03:42:33.130 --> 03:42:38.130
you can see the gray drift into colored fabric and skin.

4919
03:42:38.530 --> 03:42:42.655
The body is restored to a

4920
03:42:42.655 --> 03:42:44.921
flesh form.

4921
03:42:45.790 --> 03:42:47.750
There's a moment of pause

4922
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:52.160
as you can see Corrin was in a mid-battle pose.

4923
03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:54.363
Now the arms go lax for a second she goes,

4924
03:42:54.363 --> 03:42:56.804
"(gasping)"

4925
03:42:56.804 --> 03:42:58.337
TALIESIN: 4d8.

4926
03:43:03.158 --> 03:43:04.649
Just because I'm curious.

4927
03:43:06.874 --> 03:43:11.874
10, 18, 23, instant.

4928
03:43:11.960 --> 03:43:13.210
MATT: Okay.

4929
03:43:13.210 --> 03:43:16.127
"(groaning)

4930
03:43:19.641 --> 03:43:22.274
"What's gone on?

4931
03:43:22.274 --> 03:43:23.907
"(grunting)"

4932
03:43:23.907 --> 03:43:24.960
LAURA: Are you okay?

4933
03:43:24.960 --> 03:43:26.760
MATT: "Why am I so stiff?"

4934
03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:29.385
LAURA: Well...
TALIESIN: Be very-- oh.

4935
03:43:30.577 --> 03:43:33.719
Be very careful. You've had a rough decade.

4936
03:43:33.719 --> 03:43:36.930
SAM: Some of your muscles might not be
connected all the way.

4937
03:43:36.930 --> 03:43:39.395
LAURA: At least she's getting healed.

4938
03:43:39.395 --> 03:43:40.840
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: I'm curious

4939
03:43:40.840 --> 03:43:42.979
if there will be scarring.

4940
03:43:42.979 --> 03:43:45.735
SAM: Maybe not out loud.

4941
03:43:45.735 --> 03:43:47.880
LIAM: I said it out loud.

4942
03:43:47.880 --> 03:43:49.560
TALIESIN: We're fine, you can't--

4943
03:43:50.580 --> 03:43:53.805
MATT: "Caduceus, help me up."

4944
03:43:53.805 --> 03:43:55.580
TALIESIN: There you-- oh, wow.

4945
03:43:55.580 --> 03:43:58.630
MATT: You see, as Corrin stands up. You see this,

4946
03:44:00.413 --> 03:44:02.247
of all the family of the Clay family

4947
03:44:02.247 --> 03:44:04.090
you've seen, the eldest,

4948
03:44:04.090 --> 03:44:08.370
the sister of Constance, his aunt.

4949
03:44:09.570 --> 03:44:12.241
The hair the fading pink.

4950
03:44:12.241 --> 03:44:15.490
Not quite as faded as yours has come.

4951
03:44:15.490 --> 03:44:17.660
A lot of them you see there's, you know,

4952
03:44:17.660 --> 03:44:19.990
similar shades of that pinkish skin tones

4953
03:44:19.990 --> 03:44:20.956
some of it's been altered.

4954
03:44:20.956 --> 03:44:22.850
You can see that Clarabelle

4955
03:44:22.850 --> 03:44:26.738
has stained it all a variety of different colors.

4956
03:44:28.580 --> 03:44:32.880
She stands up, Corrin is like, "(groans)

4957
03:44:32.880 --> 03:44:34.497
"Breath is shallow, but--"

4958
03:44:38.983 --> 03:44:41.080
And she looks around and takes in

4959
03:44:41.080 --> 03:44:46.080
the other unrestored people, the folks around them,

4960
03:44:46.180 --> 03:44:48.750
the broken stone on the ground and body parts

4961
03:44:48.750 --> 03:44:51.080
and you can see her connecting all the dots and and goes,

4962
03:44:52.291 --> 03:44:56.150
"Ah. Well, whatever you did, thank you."

4963
03:44:57.410 --> 03:45:00.890
TALIESIN: Everyone's fine, we're all here.

4964
03:45:00.890 --> 03:45:05.890
MATT: "Apparently. The Clays stay together once more."

4965
03:45:06.610 --> 03:45:08.530
TALIESIN: And we have other good news.

4966
03:45:12.030 --> 03:45:15.130
Calliope steps forward and goes,

4967
03:45:15.130 --> 03:45:18.420
"We've gotten what we came for."

4968
03:45:20.670 --> 03:45:22.800
And she presents the stones

4969
03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:25.530
from the night before, themselves

4970
03:45:25.530 --> 03:45:28.680
expanding into the crystalline roots.

4971
03:45:29.770 --> 03:45:31.562
The rest of the family looks around.

4972
03:45:36.810 --> 03:45:39.300
Cornelius goes forward and takes one and goes,

4973
03:45:40.190 --> 03:45:41.620
"Well, would you look at that?

4974
03:45:42.820 --> 03:45:45.130
"We did something right."

4975
03:45:45.130 --> 03:45:48.260
He pats you on the head and ruffles your hair a bit.

4976
03:45:51.090 --> 03:45:54.660
TALIESIN: My friends, one of them is a--

4977
03:45:54.660 --> 03:45:59.550
can get us closer to home quickly.

4978
03:45:59.550 --> 03:46:02.660
Not quite to home, but close.

4979
03:46:02.660 --> 03:46:04.560
MATT: (as Cornelius) "That would be great.
That was a long walk.

4980
03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:08.900
My feet are really sore.

4981
03:46:08.900 --> 03:46:11.170
LIAM: Have you ever been to Rexxentrum?

4982
03:46:11.170 --> 03:46:13.660
MATT: "What's a Rexxentrum?"

4983
03:46:13.660 --> 03:46:15.706
LIAM: Oh, this will be interesting.

4984
03:46:15.706 --> 03:46:16.539
TALIESIN: Corrin.

4985
03:46:18.270 --> 03:46:21.568
Have you ever been to--?

4986
03:46:21.568 --> 03:46:22.973
MATT: Oh, this is to Corrin?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4987
03:46:22.973 --> 03:46:23.806
MATT: Corrin goes,

4988
03:46:24.780 --> 03:46:28.160
"I've heard of the capital city of the Empire,

4989
03:46:28.160 --> 03:46:31.830
"but I've avoided major cities.

4990
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:36.230
"We tend to get strange looks and I don't care for the food,

4991
03:46:36.230 --> 03:46:38.430
"to be honest."
TALIESIN: Can we get anywhere closer

4992
03:46:38.430 --> 03:46:40.980
or maybe with the Cobalt-- with a--

4993
03:46:40.980 --> 03:46:42.936
MARISHA: Maybe we can go to Zadash.

4994
03:46:42.936 --> 03:46:44.840
LIAM: Which is a little less heavy.

4995
03:46:44.840 --> 03:46:46.463
SAM: But it farther.

4996
03:46:46.463 --> 03:46:48.655
MATT: "It is, but it's a rural road."

4997
03:46:50.163 --> 03:46:52.188
TALIESIN: We, maybe, talk to--

4998
03:46:52.188 --> 03:46:54.784
LIAM: We could go incognito once we are there.

4999
03:46:54.784 --> 03:46:57.390
TALIESIN: Would you be all right, will everybody all right

5000
03:46:57.390 --> 03:47:01.334
if we just made a quick pop?

5001
03:47:01.334 --> 03:47:03.658
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: Sure.

5002
03:47:03.658 --> 03:47:06.497
MARISHA: It's easy enough to get to
the Menagerie Coast from there.

5003
03:47:08.465 --> 03:47:10.960
MATT: (as Corrin) "(slightly pained grunt)"

5004
03:47:10.960 --> 03:47:12.830
You get a little bit of a glimpse.

5005
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:15.590
Corrin is definitely restored to life.

5006
03:47:16.890 --> 03:47:19.307
There is definitely a...

5007
03:47:20.780 --> 03:47:23.540
what you gather a fusing of some kind,

5008
03:47:23.540 --> 03:47:26.070
some elements of where those wounds

5009
03:47:26.070 --> 03:47:30.864
were that are now extremely stiff and fused,

5010
03:47:30.864 --> 03:47:33.060
like having multiple vertebrae fused together

5011
03:47:33.060 --> 03:47:35.110
in a back surgery.

5012
03:47:35.110 --> 03:47:39.185
Corrin is locked in a specific

5013
03:47:39.185 --> 03:47:41.125
position,

5014
03:47:41.125 --> 03:47:44.807
but is alive. You pulled it off.

5015
03:47:44.807 --> 03:47:47.010
SAM: Excellent surgery, doctor.

5016
03:47:47.010 --> 03:47:48.693
TALIESIN: Thank you.

5017
03:47:48.693 --> 03:47:51.160
LAURA: Really? I just heard, like, she couldn't move.

5018
03:47:51.160 --> 03:47:53.292
SAM: No, no, she can move now.

5019
03:47:53.292 --> 03:47:56.140
She's just a little sort of, like--
ASHLEY: Stiff like,

5020
03:47:56.140 --> 03:47:57.939
you know, when you sleep.

5021
03:47:57.939 --> 03:48:01.808
MATT: "It happens at my age, anyway, don't worry.

5022
03:48:02.858 --> 03:48:04.500
ASHLEY: That was great, Jester.

5023
03:48:04.500 --> 03:48:05.633
MARISHA: Yeah.

5024
03:48:05.633 --> 03:48:09.232
MATT: You see, Constance comes over and

5025
03:48:09.232 --> 03:48:11.698
touches your arm a bit and goes,

5026
03:48:12.620 --> 03:48:14.558
"Well, we're a family again.

5027
03:48:15.508 --> 03:48:18.882
"We've done what we came for. (chuckles)

5028
03:48:21.292 --> 03:48:24.100
"I mean, that's incredible.

5029
03:48:24.100 --> 03:48:26.639
"Everyone, thank your brother."

5030
03:48:26.639 --> 03:48:28.733
(laughter)

5031
03:48:28.733 --> 03:48:31.170
Everyone looks around and goes,

5032
03:48:31.170 --> 03:48:33.140
"Thanks, Caduceus," "Thanks, Caduceus,"

5033
03:48:33.140 --> 03:48:34.149
"Thanks, Caduceus."

5034
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:36.195
They're all begrudgingly giving in.

5035
03:48:36.195 --> 03:48:39.912
except for Clarabelle, who's like, "Thank you, Caduceus."

5036
03:48:41.550 --> 03:48:45.193
TALIESIN: Missed you, so much.

5037
03:48:46.139 --> 03:48:48.830
MATT: They all come in and give this, like,

5038
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:52.950
big family hug around him.

5039
03:48:52.950 --> 03:48:54.333
MARISHA: So what happens now?

5040
03:48:54.333 --> 03:48:57.266
You plant the little

5041
03:48:57.266 --> 03:49:00.011
crystal dudes and--

5042
03:49:00.011 --> 03:49:01.761
MATT: You see Cornelius pulls away and goes,

5043
03:49:01.761 --> 03:49:04.780
"I have no idea."
MARISHA: Okay.

5044
03:49:05.880 --> 03:49:09.090
TALIESIN: Calliope knows what to do.
MATT: "I do."

5045
03:49:09.090 --> 03:49:11.020
She takes it from her father.

5046
03:49:11.020 --> 03:49:12.730
Puts it with the rest of them in there.

5047
03:49:13.700 --> 03:49:15.380
TALIESIN: Would you would you be willing to,

5048
03:49:15.380 --> 03:49:18.800
if we're all ready?
LIAM: Of course.

5049
03:49:18.800 --> 03:49:20.850
MATT: (as Mecatoth) "Yeah, don't worry,
we'll just do all this ourselves.

5050
03:49:20.850 --> 03:49:22.740
"Thanks for coming in here and leaving the work.

5051
03:49:22.740 --> 03:49:25.210
"No, seriously, we've got it, it's fine, it's wonderful."

5052
03:49:25.210 --> 03:49:27.590
TRAVIS: You should, you've been here for 10 years.

5053
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:29.940
You've got lots of time to make up for it.

5054
03:49:29.940 --> 03:49:32.060
MATT: "Yeah no, totally, we got it all handled.

5055
03:49:32.060 --> 03:49:32.893
"Don't worry."

5056
03:49:32.893 --> 03:49:34.834
SAM: Can't tell if he's being sarcastic.

5057
03:49:34.834 --> 03:49:36.897
MATT: "No, I'm being completely serious."

5058
03:49:36.897 --> 03:49:40.296
TRAVIS: Is there a chip missing
from his throat when we revived him?

5059
03:49:40.296 --> 03:49:42.691
TALIESIN: There's a chip missing from his shoulder.
MATT: Eremis goes,

5060
03:49:42.691 --> 03:49:46.116
"No, he's always been this prickly.

5061
03:49:47.275 --> 03:49:49.690
"But he means well."

5062
03:49:49.690 --> 03:49:53.990
(as Mecatoth) "I can hear you, not true, but thank you."

5063
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:56.940
TALIESIN: I'll try and return.
LIAM: Caleb starts drawing on the floor.

5064
03:49:56.940 --> 03:49:58.863
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Are we all going?

5065
03:49:58.863 --> 03:50:01.338
TALIESIN: If you wouldn't mind.
LAURA: Or just--

5066
03:50:01.338 --> 03:50:03.502
TALIESIN: If you wouldn't mind.
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course.

5067
03:50:03.502 --> 03:50:05.787
MARISHA: Can we fit everybody?

5068
03:50:05.787 --> 03:50:07.303
MATT: It's anybody who can get there in six seconds,

5069
03:50:07.303 --> 03:50:09.073
which would be quite a bit.

5070
03:50:09.073 --> 03:50:11.059
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

5071
03:50:11.059 --> 03:50:14.084
TALIESIN: Just sure makes me--
SAM: Should we tell them we're coming first, or just go?

5072
03:50:14.084 --> 03:50:18.038
MARISHA: Oh, Jester, the Zadash Cobalt Soul.

5073
03:50:18.038 --> 03:50:19.979
Do you have, like, a minute?
LAURA: Are we doing to Zadash?

5074
03:50:19.979 --> 03:50:20.812
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5075
03:50:20.812 --> 03:50:24.502
TALIESIN: Whichever's the safest passage.
MATT: You do have an Uthodurn circle,

5076
03:50:24.502 --> 03:50:26.735
which is a hell of a lot closer.
TALIESIN: Let's do that one.

5077
03:50:26.735 --> 03:50:28.355
LAURA: There you go.
MARISHA: Oh wait, we do?

5078
03:50:28.355 --> 03:50:29.640
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5079
03:50:29.640 --> 03:50:33.047
MATT: Yeah, you guys paid quite a bit for it.

5080
03:50:33.047 --> 03:50:34.023
LAURA: Oh yeah.

5081
03:50:34.023 --> 03:50:35.164
TRAVIS: What kind of a note taker are you?

5082
03:50:35.164 --> 03:50:36.328
Uthodurn. Go ahead, Jester.

5083
03:50:36.328 --> 03:50:38.950
MARISHA: Yeah. Uthodurn.

5084
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:41.400
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send

5085
03:50:41.400 --> 03:50:44.276
a message to--
LIAM: Start drawing different glyphs.

5086
03:50:44.276 --> 03:50:48.107
LAURA: -- who should I tell?
SAM: Hold on, hold on.

5087
03:50:48.107 --> 03:50:50.196
The senior Glassblade? No.

5088
03:50:51.036 --> 03:50:53.711
Lu-- no. Ava.

5089
03:50:53.711 --> 03:50:58.704
Umagorn Smeltborne? No. Reani? No.
MARISHA: No, that's

5090
03:50:58.704 --> 03:51:00.650
Rexxentrum.
SAM: The Scribewarden.

5091
03:51:00.650 --> 03:51:02.443
LIAM: Tell Reani we're coming.

5092
03:51:02.443 --> 03:51:04.880
SAM: Tumblecarves?

5093
03:51:04.880 --> 03:51:08.390
Archivist Sunlash, at the Cobalt Soul.

5094
03:51:08.390 --> 03:51:11.079
He's a gnome, or she.

5095
03:51:11.079 --> 03:51:12.490
LAURA: Wow!
MARISHA: Wait, Uthodurn?

5096
03:51:12.490 --> 03:51:13.354
No.

5097
03:51:13.354 --> 03:51:14.695
SAM: Uthodurn.

5098
03:51:14.695 --> 03:51:15.695
TALIESIN: Wow!

5099
03:51:15.695 --> 03:51:18.053
LAURA: That's who I'm going to send a message to.

5100
03:51:18.053 --> 03:51:19.969
SAM: Archivist Sunlash.

5101
03:51:19.969 --> 03:51:22.020
LAURA: Archivist Sunlash.

5102
03:51:22.020 --> 03:51:23.863
MATT: All righty, and what do you say?

5103
03:51:23.863 --> 03:51:25.769

SAM: Singing telegram?
TALIESIN: The singing telegram

5110
03:51:37.456 --> 03:51:41.511
was really great, actually. That lifted my spirits.

5111

(laughter)

5116

Okay.

SAM: Oh wait.

5118
03:51:53.345 --> 03:51:54.528
Is that the wrong person?

MATT: Okay, the response is--
LIAM: It's already happening.

03:52:11.640 --> 03:52:13.687
MARISHA: Ressia Uvesic?

5129
03:52:13.687 --> 03:52:16.053
LAURA: They said we are good to go.

5130
03:52:16.053 --> 03:52:17.186
Let's head out.
MARISHA: Is that right?

5131
03:52:17.186 --> 03:52:20.644
I think it's wrong, and in we go.

5132
03:52:20.644 --> 03:52:22.130
MATT: Do you finish the circle?

5133
03:52:22.130 --> 03:52:24.762
LIAM: No, I'm waiting for confirmation that we know

5134
03:52:24.762 --> 03:52:26.020
that we're welcome.

5135
03:52:26.020 --> 03:52:26.991
Are we welcome?
LAURA: Yep.

5136
03:52:26.991 --> 03:52:27.824
LIAM: You fixed it?
LAURA: Yeah.

5137
03:52:27.824 --> 03:52:30.147
They said we're okay to go.

5138
03:52:30.147 --> 03:52:31.830
LIAM: Oh hey, Clay family.
LAURA: Okay to go.

5139
03:52:31.830 --> 03:52:34.464
LIAM: Please line up--
LAURA: We're okay to go.

5140
03:52:34.464 --> 03:52:37.957
MARISHA: Oh no, it's Demid! It's Demid Schmidt!

5141
03:52:38.815 --> 03:52:40.064
Smlash?

5142
03:52:41.305 --> 03:52:43.220
He's a male gnome.

5143
03:52:43.220 --> 03:52:44.385
SAM: Schlash.

MARISHA: Archivist Demid.

5146
03:52:49.489 --> 03:52:50.939
I think we fucked it up.

5147
03:52:50.939 --> 03:52:53.410
It's fine.
TRAVIS: Demid Swanlash.

5148
03:52:53.410 --> 03:52:55.600
Swimlash.
MATT: Demid Sunlash is

5149
03:52:55.600 --> 03:52:58.573
who you just messaged.
MARISHA: Oh!

5150
03:52:58.573 --> 03:52:59.793
Okay, okay, okay.

5151
03:53:02.120 --> 03:53:03.215
LAURA: That is the wrong person.

5152
03:53:03.215 --> 03:53:04.223
ASHLEY: Samsonite.

5153
03:53:04.223 --> 03:53:05.057
MARISHA: No, wait.

5154
03:53:05.057 --> 03:53:06.374
TRAVIS: I was way off.

5155
03:53:06.374 --> 03:53:07.210
LAURA: Wrong person.

5156
03:53:07.210 --> 03:53:09.607
LIAM: Caleb is hold a piece of chalk going--

5157
03:53:09.607 --> 03:53:12.157
LAURA: Just go, Caleb. We're good.
SAM: We just messaged the person

5158
03:53:12.157 --> 03:53:13.798
who was researching the moon.
LIAM: Is everybody ready?

5159
03:53:13.798 --> 03:53:15.443
Clay family, are you ready to run?
MATT: That's exactly who you messaged.

5160
03:53:15.443 --> 03:53:17.332
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh!
LIAM: Okay?

5161
03:53:17.332 --> 03:53:19.032
MARISHA: Oh, we did.
TRAVIS: I'm ready, ready, ready to run.

5162
03:53:19.032 --> 03:53:21.114
MARISHA: Oh no, we did.
SAM: It's fine.

5163
03:53:21.114 --> 03:53:22.013
LIAM: Beauregard, we are going!

5164
03:53:22.013 --> 03:53:23.679
<i>Eins, zwei, drei.</i>

5165
03:53:23.679 --> 03:53:24.796
MARISHA: Whoops.

5166
03:53:24.796 --> 03:53:27.170
MATT: The circle suddenly brightly lights up

5167
03:53:27.170 --> 03:53:29.329
and you all start running in.

5168
03:53:29.329 --> 03:53:31.610
The whole Clay's family's like, "Whoa!"

5169
03:53:31.610 --> 03:53:33.070
Vanishing through.

5170
03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:35.220
You feel yourself pulled and transported,

5171
03:53:35.220 --> 03:53:36.780
thrust through a doorway,

5172
03:53:36.780 --> 03:53:39.740
and you all emerge in the middle of a cluttered library

5173
03:53:39.740 --> 03:53:43.090
in the subterranean city of Uthodurn.

5174
03:53:43.090 --> 03:53:45.030
Piling out, knocking into a table,

5175
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:46.910
sending books scattering across the ground.

5176
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:49.520
You can see a candelabra topples.

5177
03:53:49.520 --> 03:53:51.440
The lit candles rolling across the ground,

5178
03:53:51.440 --> 03:53:52.940
catching the edge of a book on fire.

5179
03:53:52.940 --> 03:53:54.715
You can see a bunch of Auditors around like,

5180
03:53:54.715 --> 03:53:55.856
"What the--! (screams)"

5181
03:53:55.856 --> 03:53:58.050
People start freaking out, guards start putting their spears

5182
03:53:58.050 --> 03:54:00.576
in front of them, as Glassblades start getting--
SAM: (yells)

5183
03:54:00.576 --> 03:54:03.410
TRAVIS: We run over and put the book out.

5184
03:54:03.410 --> 03:54:05.880
LIAM: (pained) Which firbolg is on me?

5185
03:54:05.880 --> 03:54:07.310
MARISHA: Sorry.
TALIESIN: Not me.

5186
03:54:07.310 --> 03:54:08.262
MARISHA: Sorry.

5187
03:54:08.262 --> 03:54:11.090
MATT: You see an elven woman approach.

5188
03:54:11.090 --> 03:54:14.450
A familiar figure with short platinum,

5189
03:54:14.450 --> 03:54:17.420
pompadour-like hair approach.

5190
03:54:17.420 --> 03:54:20.450
You recognize the Scribewarden Ressia Uvesic.

5191
03:54:20.450 --> 03:54:21.816
Who goes--

5192
03:54:21.816 --> 03:54:22.649
LIAM: Too little, too late.

5193
03:54:22.649 --> 03:54:25.760
MATT: (as Ressia) "What is this?"

5194
03:54:25.760 --> 03:54:26.900
MARISHA: Okay, here's the thing.

5195
03:54:26.900 --> 03:54:30.170
We put, like, a four instead of a five

5196
03:54:30.170 --> 03:54:33.700
in the, like, code--
LAURA: I sent a message

5197
03:54:33.700 --> 03:54:36.960
to Sunlash.
MARISHA: Yeah, to Demid, but--

5198
03:54:36.960 --> 03:54:38.780
MATT: "He's been gone for weeks."

5199
03:54:38.780 --> 03:54:40.130
LAURA: Yeah, well, we didn't know that

5200
03:54:40.130 --> 03:54:42.880
because we also have been gone for a while.

5201
03:54:42.880 --> 03:54:45.540
So--
MATT: "Get out."

5202
03:54:45.540 --> 03:54:47.001
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "Now."

5203
03:54:47.001 --> 03:54:48.129
TALIESIN: Fair.

5204
03:54:48.129 --> 03:54:50.379
ASHLEY: We are leaving.
LAURA: Yeah.

5205
03:54:50.379 --> 03:54:51.212
TALIESIN: Hey.

5206
03:54:51.212 --> 03:54:53.850
MATT: Cornelius is like, "Wow, this is an amazing place.

5207
03:54:53.850 --> 03:54:56.460
"Nice to meet everybody, I'm Cornelius Clay.

5208
03:54:56.460 --> 03:54:58.027
"This is my wife, Constance."
MARISHA: Don't touch anything.

5209
03:54:58.027 --> 03:54:59.043
MATT: "This--"
MARISHA: Don't.

5210
03:54:59.043 --> 03:55:00.290
MATT: "Okay, sorry.

5211
03:55:00.290 --> 03:55:01.450
"We're going.

5212
03:55:01.450 --> 03:55:03.026
"It's a beautiful place you have.

5213
03:55:03.026 --> 03:55:04.069
"I really like the atmosphere."

5214
03:55:04.069 --> 03:55:07.315
LIAM: Clays, this is a walk and talk.

5215
03:55:07.315 --> 03:55:09.420
MATT: You guys all slowly push through.

5216
03:55:09.420 --> 03:55:11.280
People start putting the table back up

5217
03:55:11.280 --> 03:55:13.847
and trying to get the candelabra back in place.

5218
03:55:13.847 --> 03:55:15.413
TRAVIS: Sorry about the books.

5219
03:55:15.413 --> 03:55:18.470
ASHLEY: I help on the way out,
just putting things back. Sorry.

5220
03:55:18.470 --> 03:55:20.040
MATT: You guys eventually emerge

5221
03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:22.280
to the exterior of the Vellum Steeple

5222
03:55:22.280 --> 03:55:26.070
here within the Deliberation Disk

5223
03:55:26.070 --> 03:55:29.036
of Uthodurn.

5224
03:55:29.036 --> 03:55:30.603
You're catching a lot of attention.

5225
03:55:30.603 --> 03:55:33.300
This is a gathering

5226
03:55:33.300 --> 03:55:35.820
of relatively colorful firbolgs,

5227
03:55:35.820 --> 03:55:37.750
which aren't a familiar sight in this area,

5228
03:55:37.750 --> 03:55:41.230
as well as yourselves amongst the populace here

5229
03:55:41.230 --> 03:55:42.650
in the middle of Uthodurn,

5230
03:55:42.650 --> 03:55:45.417
but here you are.

5231
03:55:47.390 --> 03:55:48.980
The rest of the Clay family is looking about

5232
03:55:48.980 --> 03:55:50.060
and taking in the atmosphere.

5233
03:55:50.060 --> 03:55:52.410
This is a place that some of them haven't been.

5234
03:55:53.430 --> 03:55:56.640
Corrin goes, "It's been some time

5235
03:55:56.640 --> 03:55:59.150
"since I've visited this place.

5236
03:55:59.150 --> 03:56:02.993
"See, food here, much better than the Empire."

5237
03:56:02.993 --> 03:56:05.159
TALIESIN: That's true, I do remember that.

5238
03:56:07.020 --> 03:56:08.710
LIAM: Sorry.
TALIESIN: Well, I'm...

5239
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:09.840
It's nothing personal.

5240
03:56:12.970 --> 03:56:16.400
MATT: "It's bland."
TALIESIN: I wasn't going to say it.

5241
03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:18.660
LAURA: The food here is exceptionally good, though, I mean.

5242
03:56:18.660 --> 03:56:19.660
LIAM: To each their own.

5243
03:56:20.660 --> 03:56:22.260
TALIESIN: We're close to home from here.

5244
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:26.180
How far?
MATT: "It's a

5245
03:56:26.180 --> 03:56:27.740
"few days' journey, I think,

5246
03:56:30.193 --> 03:56:32.770
"and then we make it to the Savalirwood

5247
03:56:32.770 --> 03:56:35.520
"which, I think all of us together

5248
03:56:35.520 --> 03:56:39.472
"we should be able to traverse safely, if we're careful."

5249
03:56:42.150 --> 03:56:43.400
TALIESIN: Beau, would you be willing to

5250
03:56:45.710 --> 03:56:50.120
maybe get some Cobalt protection

5251
03:56:50.120 --> 03:56:54.513
or I don't know, just someone to.

5252
03:56:54.513 --> 03:56:56.424
MARISHA: Ehh.

5253
03:56:56.424 --> 03:56:58.910
TALIESIN: I don't know.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5254
03:56:58.910 --> 03:57:03.300
TALIESIN: Just to the garden and back.

5255
03:57:03.300 --> 03:57:05.510
LAURA: We can see if Reani's around, maybe she would go.

5256
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:06.700
MARISHA: That's kind of what I was thinking, too.

5257
03:57:06.700 --> 03:57:08.850
MATT: There's no Cobalt Soul archive here,

5258
03:57:08.850 --> 03:57:10.480
this is not part of their network.

5259
03:57:10.480 --> 03:57:12.360
You met an individual who belonged to it

5260
03:57:12.360 --> 03:57:14.630
who was here for research and that's who Sunlash was,

5261
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:17.010
but there is no actual installed--

5262
03:57:17.010 --> 03:57:19.581
MARISHA: Actually, isn't this in, like,

5263
03:57:19.581 --> 03:57:22.069
Reani's place?
MATT: This is where you met Reani, yeah.

5264
03:57:22.069 --> 03:57:23.790
LIAM: Town. This is her town.
MARISHA: No, no,

5265
03:57:23.790 --> 03:57:27.900
but where's the circle?

5266
03:57:27.900 --> 03:57:28.733
MATT: Which one?

5267
03:57:28.733 --> 03:57:30.238
MARISHA: The one we just came through?

5268
03:57:30.238 --> 03:57:33.064
MATT: It's in the Vellum Temple.

5269
03:57:33.064 --> 03:57:34.964
MARISHA: In the Vellum Temple.
MATT: Yeah, the--

5270
03:57:34.964 --> 03:57:36.630
TALIESIN: Been a while.

5271
03:57:36.630 --> 03:57:37.471
LAURA: ♪ Been a while! ♪

5272
03:57:37.471 --> 03:57:39.280
MATT: The research center here in Uthodurn.

5273
03:57:39.280 --> 03:57:42.340
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

5274
03:57:43.890 --> 03:57:46.330
Yeah, I mean, I guess we can try and find Reani.

5275
03:57:46.330 --> 03:57:48.780
SAM: Sure.
TALIESIN: Message Reani, maybe? See if she'll--

5276
03:57:48.780 --> 03:57:50.536
LAURA: Yeah, I'll send a message to Reani.

5277
03:57:50.536 --> 03:57:54.288
TALIESIN: Ask her if she'd be
willing to accompany my family.

5278
03:57:55.400 --> 03:57:57.420
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: On a mission to get them

5279
03:57:57.420 --> 03:58:01.300
to the garden.
SAM: They're good people, right?

5280
03:58:01.300 --> 03:58:02.720
TALIESIN: Very. The best.

5281
03:58:02.720 --> 03:58:04.620
LAURA: Hi Reani!
TALIESIN: Most of them.

5282
03:58:04.620 --> 03:58:06.370
LAURA: We're in your town.

5283
03:58:06.370 --> 03:58:10.197
Can you-- do you want to help

5284
03:58:10.197 --> 03:58:15.180
go on a mission to keep Caduceus' family safe?

5285
03:58:16.280 --> 03:58:17.505
Let me know.

5286
03:58:19.240 --> 03:58:20.440
MATT: Reani responds with,

5287
03:58:22.690 --> 03:58:26.880
"I'm finishing up a run to the Savalirwood

5288
03:58:26.880 --> 03:58:29.556
"But--
LAURA: Oh!

5289
03:58:29.556 --> 03:58:34.210
MATT: "I could."
LAURA: Ooh! Oh!

5290
03:58:34.210 --> 03:58:35.440
I wonder when she'll be back.

5291
03:58:35.440 --> 03:58:37.954
She's finishing up a run to Savalirwood.

5292
03:58:37.954 --> 03:58:40.220
MATT: "I couldn't meet them somewhere."

5293
03:58:40.220 --> 03:58:43.246
LAURA: Oh, hey, that's good.

5294
03:58:43.246 --> 03:58:45.240
TALIESIN: That'll do.
LAURA: She can meet them somewhere.

5295
03:58:45.240 --> 03:58:49.600
Where should they meet her? So I can tell her.

5296
03:58:49.600 --> 03:58:52.560
TALIESIN: Ask her to pick a point to meet.

5297
03:58:52.560 --> 03:58:56.270
LAURA: And then when?
TALIESIN: As soon as possible.

5298
03:58:56.270 --> 03:58:59.990
LAURA: Okay, ask her whether she--

5299
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:01.690
and then I waste another fucking spell.

5300
03:59:01.690 --> 03:59:03.490
What if I just tell her where to go?

5301
03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:09.250
TALIESIN: I suppose to meet at the edge of town.

5302
03:59:09.250 --> 03:59:12.340
Or we had an inn, didn't we?

5303
03:59:12.340 --> 03:59:15.437
MATT: You have a map, too, of the Greying Wildlands

5304
03:59:16.412 --> 03:59:18.870
SAM: Where's the map?
LAURA: Where's the map?

5305
03:59:18.870 --> 03:59:20.792
(high-pitched) Hey, man! Where's the map?

5306
03:59:22.491 --> 03:59:23.749
TRAVIS: Nope.
MATT: Nope.

5307
03:59:23.749 --> 03:59:26.200
TRAVIS: Nope.
MATT: (laughs)

5308
03:59:26.200 --> 03:59:27.428
TALIESIN: So many maps.

5309
03:59:29.628 --> 03:59:31.860
MATT: There, that's the one.

5310
03:59:31.860 --> 03:59:33.101
LAURA: Eyy!

5311
03:59:34.791 --> 03:59:35.765
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: All right.

5312
03:59:35.765 --> 03:59:36.815
SAM: Where's Utha?

5313
03:59:36.815 --> 03:59:38.200
MARISHA: We're here.
SAM: Where's--

5314
03:59:38.200 --> 03:59:39.660
Savalirwood's down.

5315
03:59:39.660 --> 03:59:41.250
MARISHA: It's--
LIAM: Savalirwood.

5316
03:59:41.250 --> 03:59:43.540
Which is huge.
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

5317
03:59:43.540 --> 03:59:46.499
LAURA: Is there an inn at the lake or along the river?

5318
03:59:46.499 --> 03:59:47.696
SAM: An inn?

5319
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:50.330
MATT: You're being really helpful, Travis.

5320
03:59:51.620 --> 03:59:53.370
SAM: Is there a big--
MARISHA: Can they meet at the lake?

5321
03:59:53.370 --> 03:59:55.450
Just-- that's a huge fucking lake.
SAM: That's huge.

5322
03:59:55.450 --> 03:59:56.960
LAURA: Is there a famous bridge or something

5323
03:59:56.960 --> 03:59:58.757
to traverse the river?

5324
03:59:59.776 --> 04:00:03.707
TALIESIN: I would just have her meet them in the city.

5325
04:00:03.707 --> 04:00:06.300
MARISHA: Maybe they just wait here.
LAURA: Yeah, let's just wait here.

5326
04:00:06.300 --> 04:00:08.790
MARISHA: Ask her we can let them into their house.

5327
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:09.623
LAURA: That's weird.

5328
04:00:10.680 --> 04:00:13.660
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: We could rent them rooms.

5329
04:00:13.660 --> 04:00:16.053
LAURA: Yeah, let's rent some rooms at an inn here.

5330
04:00:16.053 --> 04:00:17.315
MARISHA: I'm just being thrifty.

5331
04:00:17.315 --> 04:00:19.740
SAM: Sure, sure. That's important.

5332
04:00:19.740 --> 04:00:21.715
LAURA: We know an inn here, we stayed in it.

5333
04:00:21.715 --> 04:00:22.548
MATT: Yeah, you know a few inns.

5334
04:00:22.548 --> 04:00:24.625
LIAM: We'll go to the inn that we stayed at last.

5335
04:00:24.625 --> 04:00:25.927
LAURA: Yeah, what's the name of it?

5336
04:00:25.927 --> 04:00:27.702
MARISHA: Which is definitely--

5337
04:00:27.702 --> 04:00:30.340
SAM: The Plexus Post, nope.
MARISHA: Nope.

5338
04:00:30.340 --> 04:00:32.629
SAM: The Tumbled Tankards?

5339
04:00:32.629 --> 04:00:33.945
The Broken Stool.

5340
04:00:33.945 --> 04:00:35.438
MARISHA: Hang on.

5341
04:00:35.438 --> 04:00:37.283
SAM: The--
MARISHA: Where--

5342
04:00:39.600 --> 04:00:41.846
SAM: We went to that bakery this--

5343
04:00:41.846 --> 04:00:44.504
LAURA: I know, I'm going to go get some.
MARISHA: Tumbled Tankards?

5344
04:00:44.504 --> 04:00:45.337
Is that what you said?

5345
04:00:45.337 --> 04:00:47.112
MATT: Tumbled Tankards is a dive bar.

5346
04:00:47.112 --> 04:00:49.303
SAM: Yeah. Plexus Post is--
MATT: I don't think you've been there.

5347
04:00:49.303 --> 04:00:50.170
SAM: I think that's

5348
04:00:50.170 --> 04:00:55.170
a selling place.
MARISHA: Plexus Post is a collector's guild.

5349
04:00:55.210 --> 04:00:58.597
Something involving Master Ava.

5350
04:00:58.597 --> 04:01:01.372
MATT: Yeah, the Plexus Post was--
SAM: The Broken Stool.

5351
04:01:01.372 --> 04:01:04.639
MATT: I would say, you could probably--

5352
04:01:04.639 --> 04:01:07.040
probably garnish a room at the Tumbled Tankards.

5353
04:01:07.040 --> 04:01:09.160
MARISHA: Wait, what's the Tumblecarves?

5354
04:01:09.160 --> 04:01:10.610
Oh wait, is that different?

5355
04:01:12.010 --> 04:01:13.529
Did I--
LIAM: This is gripping.

5356
04:01:13.529 --> 04:01:14.912
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Yep.

5357
04:01:16.112 --> 04:01:17.579
Broken Stool or the Tumbled Tankards, you could

5358
04:01:17.579 --> 04:01:20.837
probably get a room at.
LAURA: Okay, let's do that.

5359
04:01:20.837 --> 04:01:22.640
TALIESIN: Yeah, that or somewhere nicer.

5360
04:01:22.640 --> 04:01:24.140
LAURA: As soon as I know what inn,

5361
04:01:24.140 --> 04:01:27.400
I'm going to tell Reani to meet them at that inn.

5362
04:01:27.400 --> 04:01:28.630
SAM: Tumbled Tank.

5363
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:30.330
LAURA: They're getting a room--
MATT: Tumbled Tankards

5364
04:01:30.330 --> 04:01:33.140
is a lot, shiftier.

5365
04:01:33.140 --> 04:01:34.291
SAM: Broken Stool.
MATT: Broken Stool's

5366
04:01:34.291 --> 04:01:36.290
a little more rowdier.
LAURA: Broken Stool.

5367
04:01:36.290 --> 04:01:38.490
MARISHA: Wait, what? Shifty versus rowdy?

5368
04:01:38.490 --> 04:01:40.480
MATT: Yeah, welcome to Uthodurn.

5369
04:01:40.480 --> 04:01:43.105
LAURA: Let's do rowdy.

5370
04:01:43.105 --> 04:01:44.813
MARISHA: They can handle rowdy.

5371
04:01:44.813 --> 04:01:46.120
Rowdy is better than shifty.

5372
04:01:46.120 --> 04:01:47.270
LIAM: Excuse me, young lady.

5373
04:01:48.660 --> 04:01:50.080
MATT: Just a random young lady

5374
04:01:50.080 --> 04:01:51.830
or--
LIAM: Yeah, I'm sorry.

5375
04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:54.758
Can you point us to, like, a respectable inn?

5376
04:01:54.758 --> 04:01:57.980
A nicer one, you know, high end in the city?

5377
04:01:57.980 --> 04:01:59.523
MATT: So you just got a random--
LIAM: Yeah.

5378
04:01:59.523 --> 04:02:00.356
MATT: -- woman walking by. All right.

5379
04:02:00.356 --> 04:02:02.447
This dwarf woman turns to you and is like,

5380
04:02:04.049 --> 04:02:06.790
"Um, respectable?"

5381
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:09.190
LIAM: On the nicer end. A place where we can put up

5382
04:02:09.190 --> 04:02:11.870
a fair number of people.

5383
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:14.010
SAM: Like, nothing with an inn.
LAURA: You know, like, family members

5384
04:02:14.010 --> 04:02:15.820
that you're trying to impress.

5385
04:02:15.820 --> 04:02:17.536
SAM: Yeah.

5386
04:02:17.536 --> 04:02:19.070
TALIESIN: I'm going to take them to the Phantom later.

5387
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:22.971
MATT: "How much you looking to spend, and how many family?"

5388
04:02:22.971 --> 04:02:25.220
LAURA: Quite a few family, but you know.

5389
04:02:25.220 --> 04:02:26.830
LIAM: All of these tall ones.
LAURA: Not too much money

5390
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:29.147
because we're we don't have a lot of money.

5391
04:02:29.147 --> 04:02:30.942
TALIESIN: I don't mind, I'll have money.
SAM: What the fuck are you talking about?

5392
04:02:30.942 --> 04:02:32.458
LAURA: I don't want her to know we have money.

5393
04:02:34.000 --> 04:02:36.200
LIAM: We have the gold to spend.

5394
04:02:36.200 --> 04:02:39.440
MATT: "You could probably try the Underrest

5395
04:02:39.440 --> 04:02:41.650
"in the Grand Disk down below.

5396
04:02:42.640 --> 04:02:44.290
"That's usually reserved for, like,

5397
04:02:46.380 --> 04:02:51.200
"visiting family of any noble born folk

5398
04:02:51.200 --> 04:02:53.380
"or individuals that are traveling

5399
04:02:53.380 --> 04:02:57.047
"from a long journey, it sometimes--"
MARISHA: Why don't we just go to the Tumbled Tankards?

5400
04:02:57.047 --> 04:02:58.548
TALIESIN: Tumbled Tankards.
LAURA: Broken Stool.

5401
04:02:58.548 --> 04:03:00.314
Broken Stool, that's the rowdy one.
MARISHA: Okay, Broken Stool.

5402
04:03:00.314 --> 04:03:01.480
Yeah, let's just go to the Broken Stool.

5403
04:03:01.480 --> 04:03:04.640
SAM: We're cheaping out with Caduceus' newly alive family.

5404
04:03:04.640 --> 04:03:06.495
MARISHA: We're not-- they're not nobles.
TALIESIN: They wouldn't even know

5405
04:03:06.495 --> 04:03:08.650
what to do with that.
MARISHA: Exactly.

5406
04:03:08.650 --> 04:03:10.091
SAM: Give them a nice night in a hotel!

5407
04:03:10.091 --> 04:03:11.266
LIAM: What about a happy medium?

5408
04:03:11.266 --> 04:03:12.460
MARISHA: No.
LIAM: Not, like, a dive bar,

5409
04:03:12.460 --> 04:03:14.891
but not the nicest place.
LAURA: Oh my god!

5410
04:03:14.891 --> 04:03:15.724
LIAM: Rustic.

5411
04:03:15.724 --> 04:03:17.707
MATT: "You're probably looking for the Broken Stool."

5412
04:03:17.707 --> 04:03:19.652
MARISHA: The Broken Stool it is!

5413
04:03:19.652 --> 04:03:20.970
LIAM: Everyone's talking about it.

5414
04:03:20.970 --> 04:03:23.048
Let's go.
TALIESIN: All right.

5415
04:03:23.048 --> 04:03:26.965
MATT: "Fucking Dwendalian kids," and stumbles off.

5416
04:03:26.965 --> 04:03:29.184
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Reani.

5417
04:03:29.184 --> 04:03:32.720
We're putting Caduceus' family at The Broken Stool.

5418
04:03:32.720 --> 04:03:34.510
As soon as you get back, will you meet them here

5419
04:03:34.510 --> 04:03:36.650
and then they'll go to the Savalirwood.

5420
04:03:38.290 --> 04:03:40.540
MATT: (laughs)

5421
04:03:40.540 --> 04:03:44.110
"Yeah, I guess, I mean,

5422
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:48.590
"probably should be fine, I've been there for a while.

5423
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:52.085
"I think we'll be good. They're nice people, right?

5424
04:03:53.080 --> 04:03:54.213
"They're good?"

5425
04:03:56.187 --> 04:03:58.462
LAURA: (scoffs) I'll use another spell.

5426
04:03:59.540 --> 04:04:01.820
Oh my gosh, Reani, they're <i>so</i> good.

5427
04:04:01.820 --> 04:04:03.770
You're going to really like them.

5428
04:04:03.770 --> 04:04:07.310
They're cool. Also, I'm going to get you

5429
04:04:07.310 --> 04:04:09.707
some cupcakes, I love you.

5430
04:04:10.890 --> 04:04:12.200
MATT: "Cool."

5431
04:04:12.200 --> 04:04:13.393
That's it.

5432
04:04:13.393 --> 04:04:14.545
(laughter)

5433
04:04:14.545 --> 04:04:16.603
ASHLEY: K.
MARISHA: Yeah. K.

5434
04:04:19.407 --> 04:04:20.952
LAURA: I'm going to get her some cupcakes.

5435
04:04:20.952 --> 04:04:22.185
MATT: All right.
LAURA: I'm going to get

5436
04:04:22.185 --> 04:04:26.240
me some cupcakes, I'm going to get an extra dozen cupcakes.

5437
04:04:26.240 --> 04:04:28.460
In addition to those two dozen cupcakes,

5438
04:04:28.460 --> 04:04:31.234
So I'm getting three dozen cupcakes.
MATT: That's a lot of cupcakes.

5439
04:04:31.234 --> 04:04:33.230
MARISHA: Isn't this where you get those black moss?

5440
04:04:33.230 --> 04:04:34.840
LAURA: That's what I'm fucking getting.

5441
04:04:34.840 --> 04:04:38.490
MARISHA: Yeah, get those, I've been craving those!

5442
04:04:38.490 --> 04:04:40.070
LAURA: Yeah.

5443
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:42.360
MATT: All righty, I'd say between for all those batches

5444
04:04:42.360 --> 04:04:46.021
that'll cost you, I'll surmise, like,

5445
04:04:46.021 --> 04:04:49.370
five silver. They're not that expensive.

5446
04:04:49.370 --> 04:04:51.240
TALIESIN: I'll pay for whatever rooms we have.

5447
04:04:51.240 --> 04:04:53.428
It's fine for as long as it needs.

5448
04:04:54.420 --> 04:04:55.730
MATT: All righty.

5449
04:04:55.730 --> 04:04:59.440
MARISHA: Beau goes up to Fjord while Jester's checking out.

5450
04:04:59.440 --> 04:05:01.281
Hey.
TRAVIS: Hmm.

5451
04:05:01.281 --> 04:05:03.080
MARISHA: How you doing?

5452
04:05:03.080 --> 04:05:04.475
TRAVIS: Good.
MARISHA: Yeah?

5453
04:05:04.475 --> 04:05:05.375
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5454
04:05:05.375 --> 04:05:07.600
MARISHA: How you feeling about things?

5455
04:05:07.600 --> 04:05:10.520
This is a weird time to have this conversation.

5456
04:05:10.520 --> 04:05:12.120
I feel like we have, like, five minutes

5457
04:05:12.120 --> 04:05:14.785
before Jester comes out, or like...

5458
04:05:16.789 --> 04:05:18.940
TRAVIS: What things?
MARISHA: I don't know.

5459
04:05:18.940 --> 04:05:20.348
I just want to check in.

5460
04:05:23.761 --> 04:05:25.869
TRAVIS: I feel fine.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5461
04:05:27.815 --> 04:05:31.603
How do you feel about this Traveler thing?

5462
04:05:32.740 --> 04:05:34.501
Are you a little concerned?

5463
04:05:34.501 --> 04:05:38.473
TRAVIS: Yeah. Not particularly sold.

5464
04:05:39.371 --> 04:05:42.888
I think it's weird that Nott just jumping in?

5465
04:05:44.420 --> 04:05:47.090
MARISHA: Why didn't you want to go with the Traveler?

5466
04:05:47.090 --> 04:05:51.300
I mean, aside from all of the obvious reasons

5467
04:05:51.300 --> 04:05:54.403
that I know why you didn't go with the Traveler.

5468
04:05:55.450 --> 04:05:57.360
But like--
TRAVIS: You mean, other than,

5469
04:05:57.360 --> 04:06:00.330
him revealing himself and saying, "I'm not a god?"

5470
04:06:00.330 --> 04:06:01.910
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, that's huge.

5471
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:04.806
TRAVIS: That's a big one.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5472
04:06:04.806 --> 04:06:07.572
I mean, it's been shifty from the beginning, right?

5473
04:06:08.420 --> 04:06:09.440
TRAVIS: Yeah, a little bit.

5474
04:06:09.440 --> 04:06:11.820
I also, you know, prefer a little bit more stability

5475
04:06:11.820 --> 04:06:13.820
in my deities.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5476
04:06:13.820 --> 04:06:15.710
I was just wondering if we should be concerned

5477
04:06:15.710 --> 04:06:19.780
with her safety, or, if like,

5478
04:06:19.780 --> 04:06:22.250
this guy is taking advantage of her.

5479
04:06:22.250 --> 04:06:24.480
TRAVIS: 100%.
MARISHA: He absolutely is.

5480
04:06:24.480 --> 04:06:25.313
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's not a question.

5481
04:06:25.313 --> 04:06:26.590
MARISHA: Should we kick his ass?

5482
04:06:26.590 --> 04:06:27.730
TRAVIS: No.
MARISHA: Okay.

5483
04:06:27.730 --> 04:06:29.600
TRAVIS: No, not yet.
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.

5484
04:06:29.600 --> 04:06:32.690
TRAVIS: No, you tame that and then we see where it goes.

5485
04:06:32.690 --> 04:06:34.400
I mean, Jester has done a fantastic job.

5486
04:06:34.400 --> 04:06:37.810
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: She pieced a person together.

5487
04:06:37.810 --> 04:06:39.390
MARISHA: Yeah, that was insane.

5488
04:06:39.390 --> 04:06:41.180
I thought that was a fucking nightmare.

5489
04:06:41.180 --> 04:06:46.095
TRAVIS: Me too, I thought it was going to be like (spraying)

5490
04:06:46.095 --> 04:06:49.240
MARISHA: I thought he was going to be like (gurgles)

5491
04:06:49.240 --> 04:06:52.390
from his seams, yeah.
TRAVIS: I thought so, too, yeah.

5492
04:06:52.390 --> 04:06:53.430
But no.
MARISHA: No.

5493
04:06:53.430 --> 04:06:54.430
TRAVIS: She really pulled it off.

5494
04:06:54.430 --> 04:06:57.428
MARISHA: I think she might be, like, more of a god

5495
04:06:57.428 --> 04:07:01.360
than this fuckhead is.
TRAVIS: Jester?

5496
04:07:01.360 --> 04:07:02.805
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: A god?

5497
04:07:02.805 --> 04:07:04.980
MARISHA: I'm not saying, like, she's a god.

5498
04:07:04.980 --> 04:07:06.000
I'm just saying, like,

5499
04:07:06.000 --> 04:07:07.920
she's always like, "Oh, you know, the Traveler,

5500
04:07:07.920 --> 04:07:10.910
"he's so powerful," and, like, she doesn't know that

5501
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:13.753
maybe she's more powerful than he is.

5502
04:07:14.850 --> 04:07:18.681
I mean, do you think or am I just, like,

5503
04:07:18.681 --> 04:07:23.570
blindsided by bias.

5504
04:07:23.570 --> 04:07:25.272
TRAVIS: Yes, a little bit of that.

5505
04:07:25.272 --> 04:07:27.370
Also, I don't really know, he just seems

5506
04:07:27.370 --> 04:07:28.987
to appear out of nowhere.

5507
04:07:28.987 --> 04:07:31.510
None of us can do that.

5508
04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:33.943
But as long as she's not being hurt,

5509
04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:36.621
then I guess I'm okay.

5510
04:07:36.621 --> 04:07:39.190
She's doing great things with it.

5511
04:07:39.190 --> 04:07:41.876
The dicks everywhere not, you know, hmm.

5512
04:07:41.876 --> 04:07:43.458
And you know, desecrating people's beds

5513
04:07:43.458 --> 04:07:46.202
that haven't been in them in 10 years. Not the best.

5514
04:07:46.202 --> 04:07:49.663
MARISHA: Hmm. Yeah, okay.
TRAVIS: But you know, again,

5515
04:07:49.663 --> 04:07:52.080
no one's really been in there, so it's okay.

5516
04:07:53.320 --> 04:07:56.430
MARISHA: I mean, fuck those people, whatever.

5517
04:07:56.430 --> 04:08:00.703
TRAVIS: How do you feel about the Traveler?

5518
04:08:02.956 --> 04:08:03.970
MARISHA: I...

5519
04:08:03.970 --> 04:08:04.995
TRAVIS: You want to kick his ass.

5520
04:08:04.995 --> 04:08:07.232
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, he has a face I want to punch.

5521
04:08:08.540 --> 04:08:10.565
His curly fucking red hair

5522
04:08:10.565 --> 04:08:12.523
and he's like, "I don't want to do it."

5523
04:08:12.523 --> 04:08:13.964
Like, I hate you.

5524
04:08:13.964 --> 04:08:16.300
TRAVIS: I'm giving you permission, go ahead and punch him.

5525
04:08:16.300 --> 04:08:18.320
MARISHA: No, you're setting me up for fucking failure.

5526
04:08:18.320 --> 04:08:20.580
TRAVIS: I mean, yes, but I think you should do it.

5527
04:08:20.580 --> 04:08:22.320
I mean, how are we going to know how he's going to react

5528
04:08:22.320 --> 04:08:23.660
unless someone does it.

5529
04:08:23.660 --> 04:08:26.410
I could try and punch him, but I'd just embarrass myself.

5530
04:08:26.410 --> 04:08:28.400
MARISHA: Wait, so you want me to do it?

5531
04:08:28.400 --> 04:08:29.760
TRAVIS: Yes, it's better than me.

5532
04:08:29.760 --> 04:08:30.593
MARISHA: Yeah.

5533
04:08:34.920 --> 04:08:36.880
All right, we'll see how this shit plays out.

5534
04:08:38.010 --> 04:08:39.860
TRAVIS: You're punching the next time you see him.

5535
04:08:39.860 --> 04:08:41.880
MARISHA: Of cause.
TRAVIS: Promise?

5536
04:08:41.880 --> 04:08:42.780
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Excellent.

5537
04:08:42.780 --> 04:08:45.770
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

5538
04:08:45.770 --> 04:08:47.390
Jester, hey, how are

5539
04:08:47.390 --> 04:08:48.310
your cupcakes?
MATT: As you emerge

5540
04:08:48.310 --> 04:08:49.795
with your cupcakes.

5541
04:08:49.795 --> 04:08:52.027
LAURA: Cuppycakes, two dozen of cuppycakes.

5542
04:08:52.027 --> 04:08:54.950
MARISHA: Hell, yeah, give me one of those now.

5543
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:59.222
MATT: You go ahead and set up number of rooms

5544
04:08:59.222 --> 04:09:01.822
at The Broken Stool. How long you want to pay these?

5545
04:09:03.765 --> 04:09:05.800
TALIESIN: I'll have it paid, I don't know how long

5546
04:09:05.800 --> 04:09:07.530
it's going to take, but just in case,

5547
04:09:07.530 --> 04:09:12.170
I'll just put two weeks. That seems--

5548
04:09:12.170 --> 04:09:14.010
MATT: Okay, two weeks, we'll say,

5549
04:09:14.010 --> 04:09:15.980
about three rooms for them.

5550
04:09:15.980 --> 04:09:18.130
That's a gold and a half per day.

5551
04:09:19.870 --> 04:09:20.747
So...

5552
04:09:22.561 --> 04:09:24.061
SAM: 400 gold.

5553
04:09:27.809 --> 04:09:31.935
LIAM: That's was an intense
Jay and Silent Bob energy, by the way.

5554
04:09:31.935 --> 04:09:33.585
MATT: That's 20 goldish.

5555
04:09:33.585 --> 04:09:35.502
LAURA: Wait, I thought you said a gold and half a day.

5556
04:09:35.502 --> 04:09:37.220
MATT: For two weeks, yeah.

5557
04:09:37.220 --> 04:09:38.255
LAURA: Oh, two weeks.
MATT: Yeah.

5558
04:09:38.255 --> 04:09:39.621
LAURA: I was thinking three weeks.

5559
04:09:39.621 --> 04:09:41.770
TALIESIN: 20 gold, all right.

5560
04:09:41.770 --> 04:09:44.120
MATT: Okay, as you get the rooms situated

5561
04:09:44.120 --> 04:09:46.470
in this rowdy place. There's, like, shouting and laughter

5562
04:09:46.470 --> 04:09:47.750
and even as you guys walk through

5563
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:49.410
some folks notice but they don't really care.

5564
04:09:49.410 --> 04:09:53.210
They've begun already, at this point, preparing

5565
04:09:53.210 --> 04:09:54.510
for the day's work with a quick drink

5566
04:09:54.510 --> 04:09:56.510
and a quick song and a laugh

5567
04:09:56.510 --> 04:09:58.672
and a boisterous exit.

5568
04:09:59.730 --> 04:10:01.693
You make it up to the rooms and,

5569
04:10:03.059 --> 04:10:06.680
the Clay family divvy outs the spaces

5570
04:10:06.680 --> 04:10:10.610
amongst their-- and like, the siblings all here are older,

5571
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:14.480
but there's a sweet innocence

5572
04:10:14.480 --> 04:10:15.920
to the fact that their relationships

5573
04:10:15.920 --> 04:10:20.610
and interactions are almost never developed beyond

5574
04:10:20.610 --> 04:10:23.720
that adolescent relationship that they had

5575
04:10:23.720 --> 04:10:26.320
with their parents with their parents with their kids.

5576
04:10:27.277 --> 04:10:28.535
TALIESIN: That's what happens when you're homeschooled.

5577
04:10:28.535 --> 04:10:30.010
Okay. No.
MATT: Yeah.

5578
04:10:31.137 --> 04:10:32.110
But as they all go

5579
04:10:32.110 --> 04:10:34.757
about the rooms and you guys let them know about.

5580
04:10:34.757 --> 04:10:38.660
TALIESIN: I'm going to go find my parents and my aunt.

5581
04:10:38.660 --> 04:10:41.150
MATT: Yeah, they've all situated and turned back in.

5582
04:10:42.080 --> 04:10:45.520
(as Cornelius) "Oh, hi, Caduceus, my boy."

5583
04:10:48.377 --> 04:10:50.407
TALIESIN: It's been 10 years.

5584
04:10:52.821 --> 04:10:54.337
MATT: Constance steps forward.

5585
04:10:57.410 --> 04:10:58.693
TALIESIN: Feels like more.

5586
04:10:59.630 --> 04:11:02.650
I was alone for a very long time.

5587
04:11:02.650 --> 04:11:04.720
MATT: (as Constance) "I'm so sorry we left you, honey."

5588
04:11:04.720 --> 04:11:09.003
TALIESIN: Have you-- There's no blame and no--

5589
04:11:10.470 --> 04:11:13.890
I chose to be the last to stay.

5590
04:11:13.890 --> 04:11:16.218
I thought that was what I was supposed to do,

5591
04:11:16.218 --> 04:11:18.440
but I was wrong.

5592
04:11:19.660 --> 04:11:21.993
I was not the last to stay.

5593
04:11:21.993 --> 04:11:23.534
MATT: "But if you weren't the last to stay,

5594
04:11:23.534 --> 04:11:26.080
"you wouldn't have met these people

5595
04:11:26.080 --> 04:11:27.622
"you've traveled with.

5596
04:11:29.330 --> 04:11:32.660
"You were there with them at that moment

5597
04:11:32.660 --> 04:11:35.640
"because that's where you were supposed to be.

5598
04:11:35.640 --> 04:11:38.120
"That was where she brought you.

5599
04:11:38.120 --> 04:11:41.433
"And because of that, we're all together again.

5600
04:11:45.810 --> 04:11:49.220
"Please don't, don't carry the weight

5601
04:11:49.220 --> 04:11:52.450
"of our mistakes upon your shoulders."

5602
04:11:53.930 --> 04:11:55.913
TALIESIN: I don't, I've--

5603
04:11:59.500 --> 04:12:01.490
I had no idea what it was like,

5604
04:12:02.820 --> 04:12:06.211
past those walls, really.

5605
04:12:06.211 --> 04:12:07.044
It's...

5606
04:12:09.435 --> 04:12:10.561
(exhales)

5607
04:12:10.561 --> 04:12:11.819
testing.

5608
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:14.750
MATT: "That it is."

5609
04:12:16.930 --> 04:12:20.630
TALIESIN: I'm not done with it.

5610
04:12:21.870 --> 04:12:24.845
I miss home,

5611
04:12:24.845 --> 04:12:26.653
but

5612
04:12:26.653 --> 04:12:28.236
I owe such a debt

5613
04:12:30.070 --> 04:12:30.903
and not a...

5614
04:12:37.450 --> 04:12:40.708
Even to the Wild Mother herself I owe.

5615
04:12:44.520 --> 04:12:47.255
I owe it to these people to

5616
04:12:48.338 --> 04:12:49.596
see them through.

5617
04:12:51.120 --> 04:12:53.515
Not to the end of everything, but

5618
04:12:55.690 --> 04:12:56.523
I...

5619
04:12:59.481 --> 04:13:03.330
I don't feel equal to what they've given yet.

5620
04:13:03.330 --> 04:13:05.163
And I think I can,

5621
04:13:06.313 --> 04:13:10.955
and I think some of them especially still need me.

5622
04:13:16.893 --> 04:13:18.784
I'm so sorry.

5623
04:13:19.843 --> 04:13:21.643
MATT: "Don't be."

5624
04:13:23.560 --> 04:13:26.237
(as Cornelius) "Caduceus, don't be.

5625
04:13:27.650 --> 04:13:29.500
"Sincerely.

5626
04:13:31.758 --> 04:13:34.033
"We always kind of

5627
04:13:35.360 --> 04:13:38.543
"took comfort in knowing that no matter how

"excitable and wanderlust-filled

"your brothers and the sisters were,

5630
04:13:47.890 --> 04:13:51.365
"you were always the one that stayed with us at home.

5631
04:13:52.770 --> 04:13:55.460
"But we knew that wasn't going to last forever,

5632
04:13:55.460 --> 04:14:00.358
"and, I mean, look at you.

5633
04:14:00.358 --> 04:14:03.470
"I don't think I've ever seen you stand so tall before."

5634
04:14:03.470 --> 04:14:04.678
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5635
04:14:07.178 --> 04:14:09.561
MATT: "You got scars!"

5636
04:14:09.561 --> 04:14:12.710
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, quite a few.

5637
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:14.590
MATT: "Yeah, where'd that one come from?"

5638
04:14:14.590 --> 04:14:15.710
TALIESIN: Oh!

5639
04:14:15.710 --> 04:14:20.513
MATT: "It's like a spider web scar.

5640
04:14:20.513 --> 04:14:22.180
"It's impressive."
TALIESIN: Thank you.

5641
04:14:22.180 --> 04:14:24.846
That was a-- that was a spider.

5642
04:14:24.846 --> 04:14:28.805
God, there's been so many. <i>So</i> many.

5643
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:32.126
MATT: "I'll tell you what."

5644
04:14:34.593 --> 04:14:36.960
"Each of us

5645
04:14:36.960 --> 04:14:38.901
"and your aunt,

5646
04:14:41.468 --> 04:14:45.443
"we've had our experiences in the world, and

5647
04:14:45.443 --> 04:14:49.533
"we've had our own tales to tell

5648
04:14:49.533 --> 04:14:51.340
"when we were going to come home.

5649
04:14:51.340 --> 04:14:54.762
"And we get to go home now, thanks to you.

5650
04:14:56.720 --> 04:14:58.562
"When you do come home.

5651
04:15:00.340 --> 04:15:02.860
"Bring your stories, too.

5652
04:15:02.860 --> 04:15:05.235
"I think we all want to hear about them."

5653
04:15:10.828 --> 04:15:12.094
TALIESIN: I will.

5654
04:15:13.267 --> 04:15:14.100
I--

5655
04:15:17.010 --> 04:15:20.698
These people, I can't wait to share them with you.

5656
04:15:21.580 --> 04:15:23.392
MATT: "They're very weird.

5657
04:15:28.260 --> 04:15:29.620
"Like us."

5658
04:15:31.479 --> 04:15:33.545
TALIESIN: I will admit,

5659
04:15:35.020 --> 04:15:36.390
I hope that some of them choose

5660
04:15:36.390 --> 04:15:38.258
to come back when it's time.

5661
04:15:39.260 --> 04:15:40.810
I would love to see what grows.

5662
04:15:42.838 --> 04:15:43.671
MATT: "Well.

5663
04:15:46.667 --> 04:15:48.073
TALIESIN: I know I can say that to you,

5664
04:15:48.073 --> 04:15:50.390
but I'd never say that to them. (chuckles)

5665
04:15:52.330 --> 04:15:54.210
MATT: "If the winds are strong,

5666
04:15:54.210 --> 04:15:56.260
"maybe it'll carry them back to us,

5667
04:15:57.270 --> 04:15:59.883
"at the very least for a visit.

5668
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:03.563
"We got plenty of tea."

5669
04:16:05.299 --> 04:16:06.440
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

5670
04:16:06.440 --> 04:16:10.923
I'm going to say goodbye to the idiots and

5671
04:16:13.107 --> 04:16:15.015
I'll be home soon.

5672
04:16:17.560 --> 04:16:19.043
MATT: "Come here.

5673
04:16:21.360 --> 04:16:23.257
"I'm proud of you."

5674
04:16:27.390 --> 04:16:30.087
TALIESIN: Got a friend who's coming to take you guys home.

5675
04:16:30.087 --> 04:16:33.142
She'll be good.

5676
04:16:33.142 --> 04:16:35.482
MATT: "Is she also kind of weird?"

5677
04:16:35.482 --> 04:16:37.650
TALIESIN: (exhales)

5678
04:16:37.650 --> 04:16:39.400
MATT: "Great, I'm excited."

5679
04:16:39.400 --> 04:16:42.179
TALIESIN: You'll like her. A lot.

5680
04:16:42.179 --> 04:16:43.454
MATT: Constance goes,

5681
04:16:46.295 --> 04:16:49.545
"Take care of yourself, sweetie, okay.

5682
04:16:51.860 --> 04:16:53.860
"Thank you.

5683
04:16:55.560 --> 04:16:57.851
"Don't tell your siblings, but

5684
04:17:01.514 --> 04:17:04.183
"I think you're the only one who could've done this."

5685
04:17:06.897 --> 04:17:08.620
TALIESIN: Thank you.

5686
04:17:08.620 --> 04:17:11.120
MATT: (as Cornelius) She means you're
her favorite right now.

5687
04:17:11.120 --> 04:17:11.953
MATT: (as Constance) "I did not say that."
TALIESIN: I know,

5688
04:17:11.953 --> 04:17:13.036
and it's going to be so hard

5689
04:17:13.036 --> 04:17:16.370
not to tell them.
MATT: "I did not say that."

5690
04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:18.200
(laughter)

5691
04:17:18.200 --> 04:17:20.660
Corrin leans in and goes,

5692
04:17:20.660 --> 04:17:22.280
"I'll make sure they get back fine

5693
04:17:22.280 --> 04:17:23.861
"and in one piece as well."

5694
04:17:24.840 --> 04:17:26.715
TALIESIN: I trust you.

5695
04:17:26.715 --> 04:17:30.765
Thank you for everything.

5696
04:17:32.600 --> 04:17:35.980
MATT: "Thank that Jester girl for me, if you don't mind.

5697
04:17:35.980 --> 04:17:40.338
"From what it seems, she's the only reason I'm here."

5698
04:17:41.340 --> 04:17:44.080
TALIESIN: She is... so much.

5699
04:17:46.030 --> 04:17:46.863
I will.

5700
04:17:49.620 --> 04:17:52.660
MATT: As you exit out, the rest of your family are

5701
04:17:52.660 --> 04:17:54.531
all in the process of catching up a little bit

5702
04:17:54.531 --> 04:17:56.683
and telling stories. As you can enter the room,

5703
04:17:56.683 --> 04:17:58.849
they all stop and turn.

5704
04:17:58.849 --> 04:18:00.910
You can see Calliope sit up

5705
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:04.310
and give you a respectful nod.

5706
04:18:04.310 --> 04:18:05.760
Colton is still like,

5707
04:18:06.630 --> 04:18:08.510
shoulders sunken a bit,

5708
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:11.890
feels like he-- you've known him to be the one

5709
04:18:11.890 --> 04:18:13.640
that wanted to be the hero of the family

5710
04:18:13.640 --> 04:18:15.330
and he's been taken down a few pegs

5711
04:18:15.330 --> 04:18:18.290
by this whole experience and wears it

5712
04:18:18.290 --> 04:18:21.600
like a shamed dog.

5713
04:18:21.600 --> 04:18:24.333
Then there's Clarabelle, who's in the process of

5714
04:18:24.333 --> 04:18:26.490
collecting the odd bugs in the corner

5715
04:18:26.490 --> 04:18:29.500
of the room and putting them in a small jar.

5716
04:18:29.500 --> 04:18:32.202
They all look towards you.

5717
04:18:38.590 --> 04:18:41.670
(as Clarabelle) "You got the look like you're leaving."

5718
04:18:41.670 --> 04:18:45.588
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm not going home just yet.

5719
04:18:45.588 --> 04:18:47.455
I got a little bit more to do.

5720
04:18:49.220 --> 04:18:52.490
It's going to be a rough road and I've only got one friend

5721
04:18:52.490 --> 04:18:55.560
who's going to be seeing everybody home.

5722
04:18:56.983 --> 04:19:00.486
Trusting you to all take care of

5723
04:19:00.486 --> 04:19:02.130
auntie and mom and dad.

5724
04:19:02.130 --> 04:19:03.330
MATT: Colton stands up.

5725
04:19:03.330 --> 04:19:08.307
"I got it, don't worry. I'll protect them, keep them safe.

5726
04:19:09.896 --> 04:19:12.590
"I think Calliope'll back me up on that."

5727
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:15.532
Calliope's like, "Yeah, sure. I'll back him up."

5728
04:19:19.210 --> 04:19:24.073
TALIESIN: I give my brother the pat hug.

5729
04:19:24.073 --> 04:19:27.240
MATT: Yeah. (pat pat)

5730
04:19:30.186 --> 04:19:31.019
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5731
04:19:31.019 --> 04:19:33.950
MATT: Calliope gives you the...

5732
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:36.592
TALIESIN: I walk over and give Calliope a big hug.

5733
04:19:36.592 --> 04:19:37.783
MATT: She's like, "Agh."

5734
04:19:37.783 --> 04:19:40.316
TALIESIN: Whisper in her ear:

5735
04:19:40.316 --> 04:19:43.460
The whistle tonight

5736
04:19:43.460 --> 04:19:44.810
for me.

5737
04:19:46.860 --> 04:19:48.996
MATT: You see her grin curl up on the side

5738
04:19:48.996 --> 04:19:52.850
as she looks over towards Colton.

5739
04:19:52.850 --> 04:19:53.683
TALIESIN: And

5740
04:19:56.558 --> 04:19:57.401
Clarabelle?

5741
04:19:57.401 --> 04:19:58.989
MATT: Clarabelle is already there in front of you

5742
04:19:58.989 --> 04:20:00.861
like waiting next in line and just gives you

5743
04:20:00.861 --> 04:20:02.470
this big hug right around your waist

5744
04:20:02.470 --> 04:20:05.420
and holds you for a second. Backs up and goes.

5745
04:20:05.420 --> 04:20:06.845
"I got you something."

5746
04:20:08.220 --> 04:20:11.652
She hands you the jar filled with all sorts of insects.

5747
04:20:14.740 --> 04:20:16.106
LAURA: (scarfing)
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

5748
04:20:16.106 --> 04:20:17.267
MATT: They're all just, like, crawling.

5749
04:20:17.267 --> 04:20:18.940
TALIESIN: Let them crawl up into the staff.

5750
04:20:18.940 --> 04:20:19.773
MATT: And they do.
TALIESIN: And up my back

5751
04:20:19.773 --> 04:20:23.377
and let them go everywhere, in my ear.
MATT: She's like, "(giggles)"

5752
04:20:23.377 --> 04:20:26.848
TALIESIN: I got to you something.
MATT: "What'd you get me?"

5753
04:20:26.848 --> 04:20:31.472
TALIESIN: I'm going to get the big straw hat
out of the back of my--

5754
04:20:31.472 --> 04:20:33.112
just bury her in it.

5755
04:20:33.112 --> 04:20:33.945
MATT: (thudding)

5756
04:20:35.960 --> 04:20:37.800
Pulls it up a little bit so you can just see

5757
04:20:37.800 --> 04:20:39.200
her eyes peeping underneath. She goes,

5758
04:20:40.956 --> 04:20:43.259
"It smells weird."
TALIESIN: Thank you.

5759
04:20:43.259 --> 04:20:45.350
MATT: "I like it."
TALIESIN: It's been around.

5760
04:20:46.720 --> 04:20:50.200
Keep you incognito on your travel.

5761
04:20:50.200 --> 04:20:51.033
MATT: "Incognito."

5762
04:20:51.033 --> 04:20:52.730
Pulls back over eyes again, turns and

5763
04:20:52.730 --> 04:20:54.518
walks into her sister.

5764
04:20:57.890 --> 04:20:58.890
TALIESIN: I'll be home soon.

5765
04:21:01.940 --> 04:21:03.273
Thank you.

5766
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:06.567
I love you all very much.

5767
04:21:07.770 --> 04:21:10.760
MATT: You see Clarabelle turns around and goes,

5768
04:21:10.760 --> 04:21:13.240
"Love you, Caduceus."

5769
04:21:13.240 --> 04:21:18.040
Calliope goes, "Love you, brother."

5770
04:21:18.040 --> 04:21:20.057
And Colton just goes...

5771
04:21:23.190 --> 04:21:24.023
TALIESIN: You too.

5772
04:21:25.970 --> 04:21:28.830
And I close the door and walk back downstairs.

5773
04:21:33.530 --> 04:21:34.363
All right.

5774
04:21:35.520 --> 04:21:37.960
MARISHA: You have a lot of siblings, dude.

5775
04:21:37.960 --> 04:21:39.201
TALIESIN: Big family.

5776
04:21:39.201 --> 04:21:43.422
MARISHA: Your parents fucked.

5777
04:21:43.422 --> 04:21:44.745
TALIESIN: It's true.

5778
04:21:45.920 --> 04:21:47.446
It was small house.

5779
04:21:47.446 --> 04:21:49.110
LAURA: (screeches)

5780
04:21:49.110 --> 04:21:50.651
MARISHA: Wait.

5781
04:21:52.360 --> 04:21:54.439
We're going to unpack that later.

5782
04:21:54.439 --> 04:21:55.460
(laughs)

5783
04:21:55.460 --> 04:21:58.784
TALIESIN: Nothing wired about that, I don't know what--

5784
04:21:58.784 --> 04:22:03.480
MARISHA: No, we'll unpack that later. Okay.

5785
04:22:04.410 --> 04:22:05.243
TALIESIN: What's next?

5786
04:22:06.480 --> 04:22:07.650
SAM: What is next?

5787
04:22:08.690 --> 04:22:11.831
LAURA: Oh, well, I have one thing.

5788
04:22:12.740 --> 04:22:13.860
SAM: What?

5789
04:22:13.860 --> 04:22:15.890
LAURA: I want to cast the 6th-level spell.

5790
04:22:15.890 --> 04:22:16.724
SAM: Sure.

5791
04:22:16.724 --> 04:22:18.098
MATT: Okay, what are you casting?

5792
04:22:18.098 --> 04:22:20.517
LAURA: Planar Ally.
SAM: Ooh!

5793
04:22:21.700 --> 04:22:23.620
LAURA: I'm going to beseech the Traveler

5794
04:22:23.620 --> 04:22:27.023
for a person that can help me out.

5795
04:22:27.023 --> 04:22:28.148
SAM: Okay.

5796
04:22:28.148 --> 04:22:32.927
LAURA: A very mobile messenger, if you will.

5797
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:35.040
MATT: Okay.

5798
04:22:36.300 --> 04:22:38.040
SAM: Achilles?

5799
04:22:38.040 --> 04:22:40.300
LAURA: Somebody that can get around really fast.

5800
04:22:42.110 --> 04:22:43.390
Doesn't have to be a fighter

5801
04:22:43.390 --> 04:22:46.420
just something that can travel.

5802
04:22:48.720 --> 04:22:52.224
MATT: So you're-- you're spending--

5803
04:22:52.224 --> 04:22:54.460
spending 10 minutes summoning a Planar Ally

5804
04:22:54.460 --> 04:22:56.660
in the middle of The Broken Stool.

5805
04:22:56.660 --> 04:22:58.500
LAURA: I'm going to, you know, go maybe

5806
04:22:58.500 --> 04:23:00.639
into one of the rooms that Caduceus rented

5807
04:23:00.639 --> 04:23:02.439
while he's talking to all his family.

5808
04:23:02.439 --> 04:23:04.437
I'll go into another one of the rooms.

5809
04:23:04.437 --> 04:23:06.360
MATT: Okay.

5810
04:23:06.360 --> 04:23:08.760
All right, you beseech the Traveler

5811
04:23:08.760 --> 04:23:10.330
and what are you requesting?

5812
04:23:10.330 --> 04:23:12.985
Like--
LAURA: I'm going to say: Hey, man,

5813
04:23:12.985 --> 04:23:14.670
I got special--

5814
04:23:14.670 --> 04:23:17.740
Oops. A special favor that I would like.

5815
04:23:17.740 --> 04:23:20.487
Okay, if you know a creature that can fly.

5816
04:23:20.487 --> 04:23:22.940
You know, like flying unicorns, you know,

5817
04:23:22.940 --> 04:23:25.630
how they're really cool and maybe something

5818
04:23:25.630 --> 04:23:27.430
that can move around really fast, maybe something

5819
04:23:27.430 --> 04:23:29.880
that can teleport. They don't have to take me.

5820
04:23:29.880 --> 04:23:32.090
Something they can just move around really fast

5821
04:23:32.090 --> 04:23:34.430
and just wondering if you can help me out.

5822
04:23:34.430 --> 04:23:36.330
It could be you, if it's not too big of a deal.

5823
04:23:36.330 --> 04:23:39.770
I mean, I know you're really busy and stuff, but

5824
04:23:39.770 --> 04:23:44.770
this is super important, so.

5825
04:23:45.232 --> 04:23:47.348
MATT: All right, give me a second.

5826
04:23:47.348 --> 04:23:51.811
(laughs)
TALIESIN: What are you doing?

5827
04:23:51.811 --> 04:23:55.487
Better luck pulling this up on D&amp;D Beyond.

5828
04:23:55.487 --> 04:23:56.540
(laughter)

5829
04:23:56.540 --> 04:23:59.767
Because, I can actually search by type there.

5830
04:24:04.150 --> 04:24:05.439
You can talk amongst yourselves.

5831
04:24:05.439 --> 04:24:07.485
(laughter)

5832
04:24:07.485 --> 04:24:08.489
SAM: Guys.

5833
04:24:09.489 --> 04:24:10.528
At PAX East.
MATT: No, Sam, no.

5834
04:24:10.528 --> 04:24:12.261
TALIESIN: No. No.

5835
04:24:12.261 --> 04:24:15.520
SAM: Check out the Elderwood Academy booth.

5836
04:24:15.520 --> 04:24:17.252
Where Dwarven Forge will be displaying

5837
04:24:17.252 --> 04:24:19.479
their next Kickstarter, Wildlands.

5838
04:24:19.479 --> 04:24:21.304
MARISHA: (New York accent) Boston, right? It's in Boston.

5839
04:24:21.304 --> 04:24:23.071
SAM and MARISHA: (Boston accent) In Boston.

5840
04:24:23.071 --> 04:24:24.860
LAURA: Hey you guys, we're going to
do a live show this week.

5841
04:24:24.860 --> 04:24:26.349
SAM: Oh my gosh!

5842
04:24:26.349 --> 04:24:29.030
ASHLEY: Oh boy.
SAM: Oh my gosh!

5843
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:34.741
LIAM: We have got new comic book out. It's pretty good.

5844
04:24:34.741 --> 04:24:37.043
Hot cover.

5845
04:24:37.043 --> 04:24:38.343
LAURA: Hot.
MATT: I can't remember the--

5846
04:24:38.343 --> 04:24:40.453
ASHLEY: (like the Hot Pockets jingle) ♪ Hot cover! ♪
LIAM: Got that de Rolo action in there.

5847
04:24:40.453 --> 04:24:41.967
SAM: Hot de Rolo action.

5848
04:24:41.967 --> 04:24:42.800
LIAM: Yep.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5849
04:24:45.460 --> 04:24:46.840
LAURA: Somebody that can bamf a lot,

5850
04:24:46.840 --> 04:24:48.900
maybe go, like--
MATT: No.

5851
04:24:48.900 --> 04:24:51.240
LAURA: Transport via Plants, do something crazy,

5852
04:24:51.240 --> 04:24:52.940
something that can move, you know?

5853
04:24:54.487 --> 04:24:56.460
TRAVIS: What are you doing?
LAURA: Something not tied to this.

5854
04:24:56.460 --> 04:24:58.489
TALIESIN: Has anyone seen Jester?

5855
04:24:58.489 --> 04:24:59.780
MATT: Trying to search--

5856
04:25:00.780 --> 04:25:03.280
SAM: For the fastest creature in D&amp;D.

5857
04:25:03.280 --> 04:25:06.770
LAURA: Or just you know, the Traveler.

5858
04:25:06.770 --> 04:25:08.246
It could be the Traveler.

5859
04:25:08.246 --> 04:25:10.696
SAM: A cheetah shows up.

5860
04:25:10.696 --> 04:25:14.240
LAURA: He's got to know some sort of
other feytastic creature

5861
04:25:14.240 --> 04:25:17.657
that can move through plants, I figure.

5862
04:25:18.840 --> 04:25:19.990
Something.

5863
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:23.420
MATT: Okay, I think I got something.

5864
04:25:23.420 --> 04:25:25.060
LAURA: Okay.

5865
04:25:25.060 --> 04:25:26.600
TALIESIN: You're grinning. Oh no.

5866
04:25:31.470 --> 04:25:34.690
MATT: As you focus for a second and the words go out

5867
04:25:34.690 --> 04:25:37.825
the voice responds with, "Hello dear."

5868
04:25:37.825 --> 04:25:40.791
LAURA: Hi!
MATT: "I'm a bit,

5869
04:25:40.791 --> 04:25:42.940
"I'm preoccupied at the moment,

5870
04:25:42.940 --> 04:25:46.840
"but I think I've got an idea of someone

5871
04:25:46.840 --> 04:25:48.490
"that could help you."
LAURA: Oh great!

5872
04:25:49.980 --> 04:25:53.680
MATT: "Just give me a moment. (sighs)"

5873
04:25:53.680 --> 04:25:56.470
And you hear this (whooshing).

5874
04:25:56.470 --> 04:25:59.320
You look over, and this tiny doorway opens

5875
04:25:59.320 --> 04:26:01.900
next to you, run very reminiscent of the holy symbol

5876
04:26:01.900 --> 04:26:03.980
of the Traveler.

5877
04:26:03.980 --> 04:26:08.877
See this interesting verdant green-turquoise color

5878
04:26:08.877 --> 04:26:13.877
filter in the other space. And you see emerge from it

5879
04:26:13.880 --> 04:26:17.880
this three foot,

5880
04:26:17.880 --> 04:26:22.220
weirdly, elf-goblin hybrid is the best way

5881
04:26:22.220 --> 04:26:24.665
you can really describe it.

5882
04:26:26.620 --> 04:26:29.440
The creature is lithe,

5883
04:26:29.440 --> 04:26:31.380
long limbs, pointed ears,

5884
04:26:31.380 --> 04:26:34.800
a dull gray skin.

5885
04:26:34.800 --> 04:26:38.870
It's about, I'd say,

5886
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:40.620
two or so two and a half feet tall.

5887
04:26:42.560 --> 04:26:45.829
Its physical form itself.

5888
04:26:45.829 --> 04:26:46.829
(laughter)

5889
04:26:46.829 --> 04:26:49.330
As it looks at you, it has no hair.

5890
04:26:49.330 --> 04:26:53.700
Its eyes are mostly white with a very, very faint pupil.

5891
04:26:53.700 --> 04:26:58.367
It looks kind of creepy, honestly.

5892
04:26:58.367 --> 04:27:02.502
But also weirdly pretty in some ways.

5893
04:27:02.502 --> 04:27:07.140
It's wearing a very faint bit

5894
04:27:07.140 --> 04:27:10.573
of tattered clothing on it and as it emerges, it,

5895
04:27:10.573 --> 04:27:12.700
"(panting)

5896
04:27:12.700 --> 04:27:17.364
"I have been sent to help you."

5897
04:27:17.364 --> 04:27:19.290
LAURA: Wow!

5898
04:27:19.290 --> 04:27:21.514
What's your name?
MATT: "Tevas."

5899
04:27:21.514 --> 04:27:24.230
LAURA: Tevas, I'm Jester, nice to meet you.

5900
04:27:24.230 --> 04:27:26.660
MATT: He's already, like, right there, grabbing your hand.

5901
04:27:26.660 --> 04:27:29.370
LAURA: Hi--
MATT: He shakes it and his hand blurs a little bit.

5902
04:27:29.370 --> 04:27:31.756
LAURA: Okay, so I need a favor.
MATT: "Yes."

5903
04:27:31.756 --> 04:27:36.519
LAURA: Can you bamf between planes or worlds or plants?

5904
04:27:36.519 --> 04:27:39.314
Or can you just walk around really fast?

5905
04:27:39.314 --> 04:27:43.449
MATT: "More of the latter."
LAURA: Oh, wow!

5906
04:27:43.449 --> 04:27:45.837
Okay, well, I've got a favor.

5907
04:27:47.119 --> 04:27:48.890
Maybe could have done this in a closer location.

5908
04:27:48.890 --> 04:27:50.400
Huh, that would have been smart.

5909
04:27:50.400 --> 04:27:53.460
Okay, so I pull out my dozen cupcakes

5910
04:27:53.460 --> 04:27:54.830
that I just got.
MATT: Yeah.

5911
04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:56.080
LAURA: In a little bag, I wrap it up

5912
04:27:56.080 --> 04:27:58.455
and put it around their shoulder.

5913
04:27:59.830 --> 04:28:04.063
Okay, and I'm going to draw map to

5914
04:28:05.238 --> 04:28:06.436
the hag.

5915
04:28:06.436 --> 04:28:07.632
(laughter)

5916
04:28:07.632 --> 04:28:09.097
TALIESIN: I love you.

5917
04:28:09.097 --> 04:28:11.720
LAURA: I want them, I'm going to tell Tevas

5918
04:28:11.720 --> 04:28:14.680
to deliver it. You don't have to go up to the hut.

5919
04:28:14.680 --> 04:28:16.920
Trust me, don't go up to the hut, okay.

5920
04:28:16.920 --> 04:28:18.873
Just get past the brambles

5921
04:28:18.873 --> 04:28:20.895
and then leave it. Okay?

5922
04:28:22.228 --> 04:28:24.900
MATT: "Okay, all right."

5923
04:28:27.340 --> 04:28:28.323
LAURA: Here's the map.

5924
04:28:29.388 --> 04:28:33.346
MATT: "(sniffing)"

5925
04:28:34.740 --> 04:28:36.450
LAURA: All right.

5926
04:28:36.450 --> 04:28:40.775
You are really cool

5927
04:28:40.775 --> 04:28:42.041
and I believe in you

5928
04:28:42.041 --> 04:28:45.970
and-- do you want anything to help you

5929
04:28:45.970 --> 04:28:47.390
on your journey, are you good

5930
04:28:47.390 --> 04:28:49.020
are you safe, are you okay?

5931
04:28:49.020 --> 04:28:50.463
MATT: "Can I have one?"

5932
04:28:52.290 --> 04:28:53.240
LAURA: Here, let me give you--

5933
04:28:53.240 --> 04:28:55.170
I don't want you to take anything from this dozen

5934
04:28:55.170 --> 04:28:57.205
but here, have one of these.

5935
04:28:59.630 --> 04:29:02.147
MATT: Like, you don't even see the hand moving.

5936
04:29:02.147 --> 04:29:05.190
Into the mouth and all over the

5937
04:29:05.190 --> 04:29:08.005
somewhat knife-looking teeth. (slurps)

5938
04:29:08.005 --> 04:29:09.203
LAURA: What do you think?

5939
04:29:09.203 --> 04:29:12.180
MATT: "(chewing) Ha ha!"

5940
04:29:12.180 --> 04:29:13.610
Pretty good, huh?
MATT: "Yeah!"

5941
04:29:13.610 --> 04:29:15.340
SAM: Whoa!

5942
04:29:15.340 --> 04:29:17.868
LAURA: You know, come back after you deliver those

5943
04:29:17.868 --> 04:29:20.596
and I'll give you some more.

5944
04:29:21.620 --> 04:29:22.453
All right.

5945
04:29:23.470 --> 04:29:25.780
MATT: And just is gone out of the room.

5946
04:29:27.035 --> 04:29:30.500
LAURA: Wow, thank you.

5947
04:29:30.500 --> 04:29:32.652
That was cool, he's cool.

5948
04:29:32.652 --> 04:29:33.790
I want to see where it came from.

5949
04:29:33.790 --> 04:29:37.207
I want to see some more of those someday.

5950
04:29:38.285 --> 04:29:39.405
Okay.

5951
04:29:40.830 --> 04:29:42.743
TALIESIN: Gather everyone downstairs.

5952
04:29:45.150 --> 04:29:45.983
SAM: Well.

5953
04:29:47.250 --> 04:29:49.280
TALIESIN: It's time that we were moving.

5954
04:29:49.280 --> 04:29:52.038
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Where are we in our timetable?

5955
04:29:53.740 --> 04:29:55.850
MATT: I'd say, traveling through the city, I think

5956
04:29:55.850 --> 04:29:59.330
it's probably midday, early afternoon.

5957
04:29:59.330 --> 04:30:01.670
MARISHA: I think he meant, like, a grand scale.

5958
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:05.322
SAM: How many days until the meeting at sea?

5959
04:30:07.418 --> 04:30:10.893
MATT: Let me check specifically.

5960
04:30:10.893 --> 04:30:14.310
TALIESIN: We could get to the boat today, if we wanted.

5961
04:30:14.310 --> 04:30:16.508
LAURA: That's true. We could bamf to Nicodranas, yeah.

5962
04:30:16.508 --> 04:30:18.158
SAM: It's one of our only options, really.

5963
04:30:18.158 --> 04:30:18.991
TALIESIN: That's the way to go.

5964
04:30:18.991 --> 04:30:23.991
MATT: You are approximately four weeks away.

5965
04:30:24.670 --> 04:30:26.200
LAURA: From Traveler Con?

5966
04:30:27.660 --> 04:30:29.268
TRAVIS: From the meeting.

5967
04:30:29.268 --> 04:30:31.278
MATT: From Traveler Con. From the meeting--

5968
04:30:31.278 --> 04:30:33.504
SAM: It's like three weeks.
LAURA: We're only like--

5969
04:30:33.504 --> 04:30:34.537
MATT: You're about three weeks out.

5970
04:30:34.537 --> 04:30:36.095
LAURA: Three weeks out, okay.

5971
04:30:37.470 --> 04:30:39.675
It's going to take some time on the sea. So.

5972
04:30:39.675 --> 04:30:44.022
SAM: We have to get on that boat.
LAURA: Get to Nicodranas and sail out, yeah?

5973
04:30:44.022 --> 04:30:47.060
MARISHA: Is Orly meeting us and Nicodranas? He is, right?

5974
04:30:47.060 --> 04:30:48.190
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: We told him to wait there.

5975
04:30:48.190 --> 04:30:49.448
SAM: I think so.
MATT: Yeah, you didn't give him

5976
04:30:49.448 --> 04:30:51.992
any sort of additional messages to send him anywhere else.

5977
04:30:51.992 --> 04:30:55.150
MARISHA: Ho, ho, ho, Nicodranas.

5978
04:30:55.150 --> 04:30:57.200
TALIESIN: I'm coming with everyone, so.

5979
04:30:58.190 --> 04:31:00.975
MARISHA: Yes, let's go.

5980
04:31:00.975 --> 04:31:01.808
TALIESIN: I am--

5981
04:31:04.567 --> 04:31:07.480
I know I'm loved at home, but I feel

5982
04:31:07.480 --> 04:31:10.640
that I'm needed here.

5983
04:31:10.640 --> 04:31:13.330
MARISHA: Yeah, you are. Wait, were you questioning that?

5984
04:31:13.330 --> 04:31:17.640
Don't question that, that's dumb. Come with us.

5985
04:31:17.640 --> 04:31:19.770
TALIESIN: I'm not done yet.
LAURA: Yeah.

5986
04:31:19.770 --> 04:31:22.120
MARISHA: No.
TALIESIN: Thank you all.

5987
04:31:23.480 --> 04:31:27.130
I get to return home one way or another

5988
04:31:27.130 --> 04:31:28.130
to...

5989
04:31:30.730 --> 04:31:32.894
to a home restored.

5990
04:31:32.894 --> 04:31:34.997
LIAM: We'll just be grateful for the Wild Mother

5991
04:31:34.997 --> 04:31:38.777
to lend you to us for a bit more time.

5992
04:31:40.650 --> 04:31:43.142
TALIESIN: I think that is definitely her plan.

5993
04:31:45.722 --> 04:31:47.690
LIAM: All right, well, I'm not going to do it

5994
04:31:47.690 --> 04:31:49.548
in the common room here.

5995
04:31:50.500 --> 04:31:51.560
TALIESIN: Let's take a walk.

5996
04:31:53.310 --> 04:31:55.860
LIAM: Yeah, in typically Mighty Nein fashion,

5997
04:31:55.860 --> 04:31:57.160
we'll go find an alleyway.

5998
04:31:58.370 --> 04:32:00.410
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: I will draw it up

5999
04:32:00.410 --> 04:32:02.030
on the floor, on the ground.

6000
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:04.228
MATT: You manage to guard it off, like

6001
04:32:04.228 --> 04:32:06.940
an impromptu bouncer, the friends trying

6002
04:32:06.940 --> 04:32:09.520
to keep it chill, but also
prevent anyone from going through.

6003
04:32:09.520 --> 04:32:11.210
MARISHA: Nott.
SAM: What?

6004
04:32:11.210 --> 04:32:13.893
MARISHA: You going to stay, for a bit?

6005
04:32:13.893 --> 04:32:16.720
Keep the crew together.

6006
04:32:16.720 --> 04:32:18.997
SAM: Yeah, I'm coming with you guys, yeah.

6007
04:32:18.997 --> 04:32:22.758
MARISHA: Yeah. Just, you know.

6008
04:32:24.600 --> 04:32:28.440
SAM: Who would be willingly offer to split off

6009
04:32:28.440 --> 04:32:30.420
from the party by themselves?

6010
04:32:30.420 --> 04:32:31.770
LAURA: Yeah, that's so stupid.

6011
04:32:31.770 --> 04:32:33.020
MARISHA: What a dumb idea.
LAURA: Yeah.

6012
04:32:33.020 --> 04:32:36.267
LIAM: Super lame.
LAURA: All of us together.

6013
04:32:37.530 --> 04:32:40.730
We all have to be high priests, y'all.

6014
04:32:40.730 --> 04:32:42.100
MARISHA: Wait, what?
TRAVIS: Sorry?

6015
04:32:42.100 --> 04:32:44.025
SAM and LAURA: Let's go!

6016
04:32:44.025 --> 04:32:46.260
(laughter)

6017
04:32:46.260 --> 04:32:48.003
LIAM: I will start the spell.

6018
04:32:48.003 --> 04:32:52.591
(methodical chalk line drawing)

6019
04:32:52.591 --> 04:32:55.132
11 minutes later. All righty.

6020
04:32:55.132 --> 04:32:57.390
(laughter)

6021
04:32:57.390 --> 04:32:58.223
MATT: All righty.

6022
04:32:59.970 --> 04:33:02.830
You guys all gather together, stepping through the circle

6023
04:33:02.830 --> 04:33:06.830
in the middle of the alleyway here in Uthodurn.

6024
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:09.950
The subterranean warmer temperature,

6025
04:33:09.950 --> 04:33:12.520
immediately giving away from the darkness

6026
04:33:12.520 --> 04:33:16.720
beneath to the bright, open, blue sky

6027
04:33:16.720 --> 04:33:20.910
of the sunset of Nicodranas.

6028
04:33:21.970 --> 04:33:25.360
The orange horizon greets you with dappled bits

6029
04:33:25.360 --> 04:33:29.550
of distant wispy clouds, the smell of ocean,

6030
04:33:30.890 --> 04:33:35.080
clear, soon to arrive evening air.

6031
04:33:36.200 --> 04:33:39.890
You hear music and can see the warm lanterns

6032
04:33:39.890 --> 04:33:43.830
now alit along the rows of the streets here

6033
04:33:44.920 --> 04:33:47.593
as you guys have arrived in Nicodranas.

6034
04:33:48.930 --> 04:33:50.953
Within the interior of Yussa's tower.

6035
04:33:50.953 --> 04:33:51.994
(laughter)

6036
04:33:51.994 --> 04:33:54.370
MARISHA: Oh, shit.
LAURA: Yeah, man.

6037
04:33:54.370 --> 04:33:55.844
MARISHA: Why do we keep forgetting this?

6038
04:33:55.844 --> 04:33:57.051
SAM: Eh, it's our thing now.

6039
04:33:57.051 --> 04:33:58.370
MARISHA: Fuck!

6040
04:33:58.370 --> 04:33:59.900
MATT: You'll get to experience that stuff,

6041
04:33:59.900 --> 04:34:01.130
once you step outside of the tower,

6042
04:34:01.130 --> 04:34:03.977
but we'll be picking that up next week

6043
04:34:03.977 --> 04:34:04.943
at our live show.

6044
04:34:04.943 --> 04:34:08.602
We'll see where it goes there now that's happening.

6045
04:34:08.602 --> 04:34:11.260
SAM: Chicago.

6046
04:34:11.260 --> 04:34:14.240
MARISHA: The Windy City on the high seas.

6047
04:34:14.240 --> 04:34:16.460
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: City by the bay.

6048
04:34:16.460 --> 04:34:17.700
MARISHA: Nope.
SAM: So nice.

6049
04:34:17.700 --> 04:34:20.862
MARISHA: Not.
SAM: They named it twice.

6050
04:34:20.862 --> 04:34:23.780
MARISHA: No, that's not--

6051
04:34:23.780 --> 04:34:27.658
Two different--
TALIESIN: I think they just named it once.

6052
04:34:27.658 --> 04:34:29.659
SAM: Big Ben.

6053
04:34:29.659 --> 04:34:30.901
MATT: Jesus.

6054
04:34:31.909 --> 04:34:33.569
Yeah, we'll pick up--

6055
04:34:33.569 --> 04:34:36.280
Pick up fresh in the Menagerie Coast.

6056
04:34:36.280 --> 04:34:37.660
Probably gathering the Balleater

6057
04:34:37.660 --> 04:34:41.690
and whatever you guys want to take it from there.

6058
04:34:41.690 --> 04:34:45.010
To the Lucidian Ocean towards the negotiation

6059
04:34:45.010 --> 04:34:46.880
between the two warring nations.

6060
04:34:46.880 --> 04:34:47.713
MARISHA: Oh boy!

6061
04:34:47.713 --> 04:34:52.070
MATT: And the looming promise of Traveler Con.

6062
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:53.280
We'll see you guys live next week

6063
04:34:53.280 --> 04:34:57.590
at 6:00pm Pacific, 8:00pm Central.

6064
04:34:57.590 --> 04:35:00.340
I think it is, or those who see it at

6065
04:35:00.340 --> 04:35:04.288
the live show at C2E2.

6066
04:35:04.288 --> 04:35:07.460
Until then, have a wonderful week.

6067
04:35:07.460 --> 04:35:10.923
We love you very much, and this is Thursday yet?

6068
04:35:10.923 --> 04:35:11.800
Good night!

6069
04:35:11.800 --> 04:35:14.510
(dramatic music)

00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.052
MATT: Welcome guys, glad you could join us
tonight. Before we get started on the game

00:00:04.052 --> 00:00:07.530
tonight, I've got some quick announcements to get
through, so bear with us here. First and foremost,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.229
we have returning tonight our fantastic sponsor
and friend, D&amp;D Beyond! Sam.

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:19.319
SAM: As we've previously announced, D&amp;D Beyond is
contributing $100 to 826LA for every natural one

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:26.550
we roll, and that's a lot! Also, as part of the
826LA charity initiative, now that we're way past

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.562
our $10,000 tier, D&amp;D Beyond has offered up the
discount code "826LA" for 25% off the legendary

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:38.694
bundle. The legendary bundle includes all the
digital materials available on the D&amp;D Beyond

00:00:38.694 --> 00:00:47.067
site, so check it out now. A quick history lesson:
I did some research. D&amp;D Beyond actually, even

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:54.656
though it's a popular modern website, it started
in the 80s when D&amp;D started to get popular. It

00:00:54.656 --> 00:01:01.597
didn't catch on because there was no internet, but
they still had the website. They did an ad push

00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:09.781
for it and I found a script from their earliest ad
that they put out. It's a little dated. It's a

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:15.327
1980s ad for D&amp;D Beyond, and me and my friends
here are going to act it out for you.

00:01:15.327 --> 00:01:16.615
TALIESIN: Help.

00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:23.401
SAM: We fade in on a teenager's room. Knock,
knock, knock.

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:27.493
TALIESIN: Son! Turn down that Whitney Houston tape
for a second!

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:30.814
SAM: Grody to the max, Dad! It's Pet Shop Boys.

00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:32.921
TALIESIN: Whatever. Did you do your homework?

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:39.121
SAM: No duh, and now I'm going to watch 21 Jump
Street on that brand new TV network, Fox! Richard

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:40.635
Grieco is bodacious!

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:43.653
LAURA: Well, your friend, Gail, is here to play
that game you love.

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:46.171
SAM: Punchout? Contra? Operation Wolf?

00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:49.539
LAURA: No, the one your Aunt Pam says was invented
by Satanists.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.567
ASHLEY: Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:56.323
SAM: Hey, Gail! Where's the beef?

00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:58.109
ASHLEY: Eat my shorts, dude!

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:05.369
TALIESIN: Gail, are you sure D&amp;D is safe? It
scares me like rap music by Public Enemy and LL Cool J.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.882
SAM: Take a chill pill, Dad! D&amp;D is radical. It's
as trustworthy as current Democratic presidential

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.688
nominee Gary Hart.

00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:15.342
TALIESIN: He is trustworthy.

00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:17.455
(laughter)

00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:26.140
ASHLEY: Now it's even better with D&amp;D Beyond, with
high speed internet, WiFi or a smartphone you can

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.520
access your stats and more on your iPad or laptop.

00:02:29.596 --> 00:02:31.668
LAURA: Have any of those things been invented
yet?

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:34.210
ASHLEY: Gag me with a spoon, Mrs. Henderson.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.922
SAM: Righteous! Now I don't even want to go see
that brand new movie, The Lost Boys, I just want

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:42.015
to play D&amp;D! Cut to Travis.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:46.779
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond, available now exclusively at
Sharper Image, Sam Goody, Circuit City, Tower

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.726
Records, Comp USA and Crazy Eddie.

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:52.779
(laughter)

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.724
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:02:55.724 --> 00:02:58.010
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.063
LIAM: How on earth did you not put a Growing Pains
reference in that?

00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:06.958
SAM: This is all heavily researched 1987 facts.

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:15.133
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.
We have another sponsor tonight. We've talked

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:19.283
about them a little bit in the past and we're
super excited to bring Pillars of Eternity II:

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:23.819
Deadfire as an awesome sponsor of the show
tonight. Once again, from the great Pillars of

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:32.057
Eternity series, I was in the first one and all of
us are in this one. It comes out very soon, May

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:40.572
8th. It's in the same world, Eora. It's a really
fantastic isometric RPG in the classic style of

00:03:40.572 --> 00:03:44.897
Baldur's Gate. The graphics are beautiful, and the
music's incredible. You'd have heard the first

00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:50.671
game's music all through most of the Critical
Role's run so far. It's a great story. For those

00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:55.913
that have finished the first game, it deals with
the god Eothas who is now terrorizing this area

00:03:55.913 --> 00:04:03.191
called Deadfire. It's very pirate ships and
oceanic island travel and it's pretty badass. You

00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:08.009
get to hear all of us in it and you also get to
customize Vox Machina in it.

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.662
SAM: What?!

00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:12.573
LAURA: You didn't know!

00:04:12.573 --> 00:04:13.050
SAM: No!

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.311
MATT: If you played the first game, you also get
to carry over your save over into the second one

00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:21.388
and actually have your character and your choices
in the first game connect to the new story, which

00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:27.193
is pretty rad. Check out the new companion voices,
play the incredible story, and customize some

00:04:27.193 --> 00:04:31.380
characters who look like Vox Machina and also
sound like them if you so feel like it. You can

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.040
check it out and buy it at
versusevil.com/criticalrole.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.683
LIAM: They've just revealed the very dashing
portrait of Scanlan Shorthalt today.

00:04:41.683 --> 00:04:43.696
TRAVIS: Sex personified.

00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:49.769
MATT: Indeed. It's awesome. The combat's super
tactical. It's going to be for consoles later this

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:54.719
year, the PC release is right around the corner.
Get super excited, guys, it's going to be awesome.

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:02.958
Thank you, Pillars II and our friends at Obsidian.
It's one of those days. My brain is melting. Yeah,

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.971
check it out. Vox Machina: Origins number six
comic has been out for a week. If you haven't had

00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:09.935
the chance, check it out.

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:10.859
SAM: I've read it. It's good!

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:17.438
MARISHA: I love it when you're surprised by your
own content. It's my favorite.

00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:22.438
MATT: That's out. If you haven't seen it yet, I
recommend it. It finishes that first story arc.

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:27.452
We'll have some more announcements soon,
hopefully. We hit our goal with 826, the charity

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:34.155
we've been doing. We've hit 40K, which means I
have to do another fireside chat.

00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:39.767
SAM: You <i>get</i> to do a fireside chat.

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:40.773
LAURA: It's a joy, Matt.

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:41.881
MATT: It's true. It is a joy, actually.

00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:43.441
TRAVIS: Sans robe this time?

00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:50.590
MATT: No. Don't give them ideas.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.575
LIAM: You want sherry or schnapps? Or what do you
want?

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:59.021
MATT: Oh, we're going port again. That was a good
night. We've got that coming up. We're getting a

00:05:59.021 --> 00:06:03.753
new stretch goal. If we hit 50K in the two next
weeks, Marisha will be GMing another Honey Heist

00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:07.101
game. Super excited for that because that was a
lot of fun.

00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.896
MARISHA: (singing) The bears are back in town!

00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:13.191
LAURA: Maybe we can play this time.

00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:18.952
MATT: Yes, because you guys were out of town last
time. That'd be perfect. Remember, if you guys

00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:24.569
help donate to 826, who are a fantastic
organization, our gracious critter, Mark, has

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.204
matched the donations and has offered to match up
to 50K now.

00:06:27.204 --> 00:06:30.900
SAM: What?! No! That's too much!

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.483
MATT: If we can get 50K, that's 100K that we as a
community have raised for this fantastic

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:43.925
organization. You guys are amazing! Keep being
amazing. Be sure to check with your employer to

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:48.181
see if they offer a charity matching program as
well, because that's another cool way you can get

00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:52.149
double bang for your buck to help out with charity
organizations, too. Thank you so much, guys, for

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:59.312
being awesome. Critical Recap just came out for
last week's episode. If you haven't checked that

00:06:59.312 --> 00:07:04.379
out yet, you should've before this episode
started! If you missed that and didn't watch last

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:07.624
week's episode, you'll be very confused. If you
have a friend who's behind and wants to catch up

00:07:07.624 --> 00:07:11.064
with the live stream, Critical Recap is a great
way to get them caught up really quickly so

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:14.519
they're not spoiled. Then they can go back and
trudge through the previous episodes in a lengthy

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:20.391
format. Talks Machina is every Tuesday at 7:00pm
Pacific time, where our fantastic host, Brian W.

00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:26.051
Foster, talks about the previous episode. Next
week will be this episode of Critical Role with a

00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:29.626
few guests from the show to come there and talk
about what randomness happened in our brain

00:07:29.626 --> 00:07:36.036
tonight. Check that out. Podcast of last week's
episode is available where all fine podcasts are

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:40.975
available for download. To remind you, because
it's been a few weeks, I'll be at Otafest at

00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:45.043
Calgary May 18th to 20th. Not that far from now,
just a few weeks. Be seeing some of you Canadian

00:07:45.043 --> 00:07:51.018
folks. I'll be at A-Kon in Texas June 7th to 10th,
so look forward to seeing you guys there. I think,

00:07:51.018 --> 00:07:54.701
unless there's anything else I missed, that's all
the announcements we have in log.

00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:56.504
LIAM: My gosh, you've got a lot going on these
days.

00:07:56.504 --> 00:08:03.869
MATT: I know. It's all sorts of crazy, let me tell
you. It's a lot. On that note, folks, let's go

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:09.318
ahead and dive into tonight's episode of Critical
Role.

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:13.644
[click, TV static]

00:08:13.644 --> 00:09:31.705
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:40.532
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Last we left off:
The Mighty Nein, after being in proximity to some

00:09:40.532 --> 00:09:45.852
sort of an assault from Xhorhasian operatives in
the city of Zadash here in the center of the

00:09:46.153 --> 00:09:52.913
Empire, they found themselves also caught up in a
murder of the High-Richter in the city. They

00:09:52.913 --> 00:09:57.928
pulled away and realized there was a manhunt for
individuals that were seemingly seen in connection

00:09:57.928 --> 00:10:03.644
to this murder. As this was transpiring, they had
to smuggle out some allies they had found and had

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:10.601
been working with, Dolan and Horris. Dolan, part
of this whole deal was to get him involved in the

00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:16.138
local politics. Horris needed to be smuggled out
for safety in case they got caught. You made your

00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:21.668
way to the Evening Nip, met up with Yasha. Down
there, you had a conversation with this individual

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:27.509
called The Gentleman. You made a deal. You've
decided to trust each other on this endeavor and

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:31.390
basically do a quid pro quo. A little favor to
one, favor for the other and see if this is a

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.957
business relationship you would want to develop.
In doing so, Horris was smuggled out of the city.

00:10:35.957 --> 00:10:37.714
Safely, seemingly.

00:10:37.714 --> 00:10:40.418
LAURA: He keeps saying seemingly! He keeps saying
that!

00:10:40.418 --> 00:10:45.675
MATT: I keep saying that because you weren't there
to confirm! I don't want to say that it happened

00:10:45.675 --> 00:10:52.787
because the mystery's fun. You were brought down
through the tunnels to the Underworks, towards an

00:10:52.787 --> 00:10:58.330
underground dock, where the river that exited to
the northeast towards Berleben was. You loaded up

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:04.170
on boats to make your way towards a recently
uncovered but barely explored underground research

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.265
facility, long buried. The Gentleman asked you to
enter it, see what you found, clear it out if

00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:15.005
possible, and return. As you made your way down
there, assailed by a few of the creatures that

00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:20.053
existed in that tunnel, you found the exterior of
this research facility, broke your way in, began

00:11:20.053 --> 00:11:26.739
to meander around and discover strange mysteries
afoot in its construction. The urns throughout the

00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:32.118
vicinity, the strange wisps of spiritual energy
came to assault you in the process. Bypassing

00:11:32.118 --> 00:11:34.396
traps, mostly, kind of.

00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:37.516
TRAVIS: Or not at all.

00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:46.205
MATT: Completing the mystery of the strange arcane
runes in the ceiling and the schools of magic that

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:53.278
they seemed connected to, found your way into some
sort of a secret study or den, where there were

00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:58.890
research tables set up, and a mostly empty
bookshelf, braziers filled with ash to the side

00:11:59.472 --> 00:12:04.398
between pillars, two small chambers where these
cages with tight knit bars remained, containing

00:12:04.398 --> 00:12:08.123
urns and empty nooses hanging above. These urns
filled with ash.

00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:12.222
You began to look throughout the room. You found a
sword across the upper ceiling, an ornamental

00:12:12.222 --> 00:12:17.187
blade of some kind. You recovered a book of notes
and began to read through to get a feel for the

00:12:17.187 --> 00:12:23.095
person, the entity that seemed to have written
what remained of these pages. Around this time,

00:12:23.095 --> 00:12:28.842
the wind began to pick up in the center of the
chamber, as this darkened figure began to rise out

00:12:28.842 --> 00:12:33.952
of the stonework. This large, tattered cloak of a
figure, spreading, whipping around like this

00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:40.926
sudden wind is tossing aside sails of a dark ship.
This semi-skeletal ghostly face of material began

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:52.462
to emerge from it. Its voice slowly hissing out,
"My secrets are yours." You saw small glows begin

00:12:52.462 --> 00:12:58.982
to emerge from the ash and to the urns nearest the
two of you. That, my friends, is where we last

00:12:58.982 --> 00:12:59.482
left off.

00:12:59.482 --> 00:13:04.821
LAURA: That's right. We marked our places on the
map, where we left last time.

00:13:04.821 --> 00:13:07.360
SAM: We did? I was very intoxicated.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.908
MATT: As this thing emerges here, it doesn't seem
to, at the moment, make any sort of aggressive

00:13:13.908 --> 00:13:15.226
maneuver. What do you do?

00:13:15.226 --> 00:13:16.790
LIAM: Does it have any legs?

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:24.520
MATT: Imagine a figure that is wrapped in four or
five layers of robes, and the robes have been

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:31.309
shredded out, all these moving tendrils of cloth
and black shadow energy that are spinning around

00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:37.099
in places. Its center chin and body are
stationary. The bottom half of its body seems to

00:13:37.099 --> 00:13:43.443
taper into nothingness, disappearing into cloth
and ever-shifting and whipping material at the base.

00:13:43.443 --> 00:13:46.138
LAURA: Are you Siff?

00:13:46.676 --> 00:13:52.240
MATT: The head turns over and locks onto Jester.
Doesn't answer.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.797
MARISHA: He said he wants to tell us secrets or
something. I like secrets.

00:13:56.797 --> 00:13:58.236
LAURA: Secrets are fun.

00:13:58.236 --> 00:14:00.193
MARISHA: Yeah. Secrets make friends.

00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:06.628
MATT: (moaning) Glides slowly in your direction.

00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:11.104
SAM: Give him something. Information, news,
something.

00:14:11.104 --> 00:14:26.598
LAURA: I have a secret for you! Did you know that
in Nicodranas the pastries are made with cinnamon

00:14:26.598 --> 00:14:28.870
and here they're not?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:34.458
(laughter)

00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:41.688
MATT: There's a brief moment where the entity's
head, much like a young puppy confused by a

00:14:41.688 --> 00:14:53.774
rattling sound in the distance, (snapping) in
Jester's direction, "A secret for trade."

00:14:53.774 --> 00:14:59.615
MARISHA: For trade, what does that mean?

00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:04.007
MATT: You know what? I'm going to pull the battle
map.

00:15:04.007 --> 00:15:06.070
LAURA: Oh no!

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.934
SAM: Cinnamon was his most hated spice!

00:15:09.934 --> 00:15:13.218
LAURA: I gave him a secret!

00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:17.134
SAM: He fucking hates cinnamon!

00:15:20.464 --> 00:15:24.884
LAURA: Oh no! I thought I was helping.

00:15:24.884 --> 00:15:26.639
ASHLEY: You were. You did great.

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:28.578
MATT: He's drifted up to that point there.

00:15:28.578 --> 00:15:30.331
LAURA: He's in the teleportation circle.

00:15:30.331 --> 00:15:32.427
SAM: Ashley, even you don't believe that.

00:15:32.427 --> 00:15:43.468
MATT: As you guys are preparing here, the whispers
begin to slowly spill out of its face, voices

00:15:43.468 --> 00:15:50.872
spreading out. I need Jester, Yasha, and Beau to
all make a wisdom saving throw, please.

00:15:54.492 --> 00:15:56.253
TALIESIN: My clay pot is glowing?

00:15:56.253 --> 00:15:57.116
MATT: Yes.

00:16:00.966 --> 00:16:01.876
MARISHA: Nine.

00:16:01.876 --> 00:16:03.021
LAURA: 15.

00:16:04.741 --> 00:16:05.640
ASHLEY: 14.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.003
MATT: Both of you succeed actually.

00:16:11.483 --> 00:16:13.428
MARISHA: Tell me something cool!

00:16:13.428 --> 00:16:18.470
MATT: The secrets begin to penetrate your ears.
You close off your consciousness and put your

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:23.313
hands up to close the space. They don't seem to
penetrate your mind. Beau, however, these words

00:16:23.313 --> 00:16:28.597
start shooting into your brain. You feel for a
moment your grasp on reality begin to slip.

00:16:28.597 --> 00:16:32.368
Suddenly, the world begins to spin. You feel
yourself assaulted from all angles. You see

00:16:32.368 --> 00:16:38.731
flashes of ancient warfare, of giant columns of
fire crashing from the cosmos. You spin your staff

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:41.472
around retroactively. I need you to make an attack
against Yasha, please.

00:16:41.472 --> 00:16:49.230
MARISHA: I'm sorry, boo! It's not good, an 11.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.987
MATT: What's your armor class?

00:16:50.987 --> 00:16:52.562
MARISHA: No sorry, ten.

00:16:52.562 --> 00:16:54.445
MATT: I'm pretty sure that doesn't hit you.

00:16:54.445 --> 00:16:54.995
ASHLEY: 14.

00:16:54.995 --> 00:16:59.610
MATT: You see Beau, suddenly her eyes go wide,
swing the staff wide in your direction. You

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.442
deflect it with your blade.

00:17:01.442 --> 00:17:02.981
MARISHA: Fuck you, Genghis Khan!

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:06.416
MATT: Now I need you all to roll initiative.

00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:10.135
LAURA: I wanted to talk!

00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:14.062
MATT: The first conversation wasn't quite what he
was looking for.

00:17:14.062 --> 00:17:14.905
LAURA: Shit balls.

00:17:14.905 --> 00:17:16.839
ASHLEY: Dang it, maybe we can still talk.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:20.992
LAURA: Hey, I just made us $100, you guys.

00:17:20.992 --> 00:17:26.336
(cheering)

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:28.527
MATT: Conflicted feelings!

00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:33.688
LIAM: The 11 herbs and spices are--

00:17:33.688 --> 00:17:38.243
MATT: 25 to 20?

00:17:38.243 --> 00:17:40.090
SAM: 22.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:44.291
MATT: Nott at the top. 20 to 15?

00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:45.803
ASHLEY: 19.

00:17:45.803 --> 00:17:48.091
MATT: Ooh, Yasha!

00:17:48.091 --> 00:17:50.855
SAM: That's the best thing you've ever rolled on
initiative.

00:17:50.855 --> 00:17:56.763
MATT: 15 to ten? Oh boy.

00:17:56.763 --> 00:17:58.424
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

00:17:58.424 --> 00:18:00.575
LAURA: Run away!

00:18:00.575 --> 00:18:05.122
MATT: Ten to five.

00:18:05.122 --> 00:18:06.643
MARISHA: Eight.

00:18:06.643 --> 00:18:07.966
LIAM: <i>Sechs</i>.

00:18:07.966 --> 00:18:08.882
TALIESIN: Five.

00:18:08.882 --> 00:18:20.417
MATT: Eight for Beau. Six for Caleb. Five both of
you, Jester and Molly.

00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:24.433
TRAVIS: Natural one.

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:27.555
LAURA: That was the weirdest, cutest hiccup I've
ever heard!

00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:28.401
TALIESIN: Thank you!

00:18:28.401 --> 00:18:36.336
MATT: At this moment, Nott, you see this entity as
it suddenly begins to emanate these whispers into

00:18:36.336 --> 00:18:40.352
the air. Your friends start all of a sudden
grasping their faces. You see Beau try and swing

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:42.633
at Yasha. Chaos is breaking loose. What are you
doing?

00:18:42.633 --> 00:18:47.712
SAM: I run. I run as fast as I can.
(screaming)

00:18:47.712 --> 00:18:48.444
MATT: Where are you going?

00:18:48.444 --> 00:18:55.712
SAM: I make a beeline for the opposite corner.
Bonus action dash! Keep going!

00:18:56.486 --> 00:18:57.150
MATT: Over here?

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.349
SAM: Yeah. Behind that cage.

00:18:59.349 --> 00:19:02.111
LAURA: There's going to be a thing that comes out
there, I think.

00:19:02.111 --> 00:19:08.613
SAM: Oh, well, I'll be first to kill it then. Then
action, I will hand crossbow up and hold until I

00:19:08.613 --> 00:19:14.565
see it make an aggressive action towards one of my
acquaintances; we're not quite friends yet.

00:19:14.565 --> 00:19:18.742
MATT: Good to know. Yasha, your turn.

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.778
ASHLEY: Are we attacking him?

00:19:20.778 --> 00:19:23.107
TRAVIS: What do <i>you</i> want to do?

00:19:23.107 --> 00:19:26.964
MATT: What does Yasha want to do? What is Yasha's
instinct?

00:19:26.964 --> 00:19:37.514
ASHLEY: I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.
I don't know if he has feet.

00:19:37.514 --> 00:19:40.682
(laughter)

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.365
MATT: You do not see a foot on his body, no.

00:19:42.365 --> 00:19:50.675
ASHLEY: Shit! Already off to a bad start. You
said, "My secrets are yours." Did you want to give

00:19:50.675 --> 00:19:51.851
us a secret?

00:19:51.851 --> 00:19:59.835
MATT: "I've already given you a piece. More?"

00:19:59.835 --> 00:20:02.852
LAURA: That's what he did to Beau.

00:20:02.852 --> 00:20:07.065
MATT: What are you doing?

00:20:07.065 --> 00:20:11.941
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to take out my sword, and
I'm going to attack.

00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:18.734
LAURA: You got it Yasha! Take him down! It's one
hit!

00:20:18.734 --> 00:20:21.071
ASHLEY: What's going on at the bottom of his--

00:20:21.071 --> 00:20:23.109
TRAVIS: What's all this action down here?

00:20:23.109 --> 00:20:29.748
MATT: That's a dormant runic circle that has been
lying there. Doesn't seem to be reacting to his

00:20:29.748 --> 00:20:31.335
presence at all.

00:20:31.335 --> 00:20:34.310
LAURA: Maybe we can activate it.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:43.878
ASHLEY: Shit, I don't like going first! Okay, I'm
going to attack with my sword.

00:20:43.878 --> 00:20:45.864
MATT: Okay. You're holding off on rage?

00:20:45.864 --> 00:20:47.382
ASHLEY: No.

00:20:47.382 --> 00:20:48.674
MATT: You're raging?

00:20:48.674 --> 00:20:51.956
ASHLEY: I'm raging. I would like to rage.

00:20:51.956 --> 00:20:57.144
MATT: You bonus action rage. You angrily grit your
teeth and rush up, swinging your sword in the air.

00:20:57.144 --> 00:20:58.764
Make your attack.

00:21:04.924 --> 00:21:05.658
ASHLEY: 18.

00:21:05.658 --> 00:21:08.520
MATT: 18 hits. Roll damage.

00:21:09.108 --> 00:21:22.142
LAURA: Kill that floating dude. Maybe he just
flies. Maybe he's got feet and his robes cover

00:21:22.142 --> 00:21:22.979
them up.

00:21:22.979 --> 00:21:23.912
TALIESIN: He's tucking.

00:21:23.912 --> 00:21:24.621
LAURA: Yeah!

00:21:24.621 --> 00:21:25.766
TALIESIN: He could tuck.

00:21:25.766 --> 00:21:26.946
ASHLEY: Eight plus--

00:21:26.946 --> 00:21:34.647
MATT: Plus rage damage, ten right? Ten total? You
rolled five, plus three for your strength, plus

00:21:34.647 --> 00:21:37.805
two for your rage. That would be a total of ten.

00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:38.734
ASHLEY: Yeah, ten.

00:21:38.734 --> 00:21:40.586
MATT: With which weapon is this?

00:21:40.586 --> 00:21:42.687
ASHLEY: My Moon-touched sword.

00:21:42.687 --> 00:21:45.571
MATT: Which is technically baseline magical so--
okay.

00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:47.344
SAM: Baseline magical?

00:21:47.344 --> 00:21:53.484
MATT: Meaning it's a very minor magical effect. As
you strike, your blade carves through part of its

00:21:53.484 --> 00:21:58.628
body. Some of the cloth tears apart and he tries
to grasp around the blade as you pull it free from

00:21:58.628 --> 00:22:05.714
nearby. Its face, its eyes click back towards you.
When I say eyes, you now get a look, and it's

00:22:05.714 --> 00:22:13.111
these vacant holes and this tightly pulled skin
against this skeletal face. Black energy is

00:22:13.111 --> 00:22:19.963
billowing out of it like smoke is slowly pouring
out of the sockets. That's your turn?

00:22:19.963 --> 00:22:22.238
ASHLEY: Yes, that's my turn.

00:22:22.238 --> 00:22:35.303
MATT: Now, out of the side cages, these glows all
begin to emerge as four more of these wisp

00:22:35.834 --> 00:22:40.328
entities you had previously encountered in the
chamber begin to shift through the cages towards

00:22:40.328 --> 00:22:44.961
the nearest source of life. This one's going to go
towards Nott. This one's going to stay right there

00:22:44.961 --> 00:22:52.693
with Molly. This one's going to go after Fjord as
well as this one there. On that note, against Nott

00:22:52.693 --> 00:23:00.605
the attack is a seven. That is a low roll; I do
not think that hits you. As you see it emerge, you

00:23:00.605 --> 00:23:05.401
freak out as it swings by and ducks into the wall
briefly before re-emerging, shifting through the

00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:09.837
actual stone. Against Molly-- another seven.

00:23:09.837 --> 00:23:11.061
TALIESIN: Ha ha!

00:23:11.061 --> 00:23:16.017
MATT: Two threes in a row. Two against you Fjord.
That's better. That's a 20.

00:23:16.017 --> 00:23:17.307
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:23:17.307 --> 00:23:22.864
MATT: The two of them begin to hit you from both
sides. You're not quite sure how to defend. One of

00:23:22.864 --> 00:23:26.955
them seems like it's about to sweep at you. You go
to deflect it as the other one slaps into the back

00:23:26.955 --> 00:23:31.753
of your head as you feel this shock energy hit you
in the base of the skull. Your eyes go white for a

00:23:31.753 --> 00:23:39.458
second. You take 11-- oh no sorry, I rolled the
wrong dice for that one. You take five points of

00:23:39.458 --> 00:23:40.649
lightning damage.

00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:46.390
TRAVIS: Excellent. He takes ten points of ice
damage, or frozen damage or whatever.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.190
LAURA and TRAVIS: Fro-yo damage!

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:54.386
MATT: You see the ice crystals coalesce around the
outside, not doing quite as much damage as you

00:23:54.386 --> 00:23:55.393
would have expected.

00:23:55.393 --> 00:24:00.225
TRAVIS: Oh, from hitting my frozen porcupine
armor? That's not great.

00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:04.748
MATT: The other one's going to try and use that
moment to swing at you and rob you of a little

00:24:04.748 --> 00:24:07.491
more life force. That is going to be a 12. What is
your armor class?

00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:08.826
TRAVIS: Oh that misses, 15.

00:24:08.826 --> 00:24:12.689
MATT: Miss then. Just swings past you. The orbs
now are glowing and sparking, preparing for the

00:24:12.689 --> 00:24:13.777
next round of assault.

00:24:13.777 --> 00:24:16.590
MARISHA: This is all the notes from what we
learned about Siff Duthar.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.004
MATT: The next is going to be the entity in the
center.

00:24:20.004 --> 00:24:24.224
MARISHA: I think he is a being of fire and ice, so
I bet he's immune to fire and ice.

00:24:24.224 --> 00:24:31.586
MATT: The entity is going to use its Howling
Babble ability. Every creature within 30 feet of

00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:34.840
it that can hear it has to make a wisdom saving
throw, so that's all of you guys.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.530
SAM: Me too?

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.460
LAURA: Can you hear it?

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.558
MATT: (counting) You're just 30 feet outside of
it.

00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:44.789
SAM: When it does this, do I release my arrow?

00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:45.645
MATT: You would, yes.

00:24:45.645 --> 00:24:51.206
SAM: Okay, I will release my arrow bolt. That's
not good, 14?

00:24:51.206 --> 00:24:53.879
MATT: 14 hits. Roll damage.

00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:56.073
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:24:56.763 --> 00:25:12.435
SAM: What do I get, 3d6 right? One for the hit and
then-- that's 18 points of damage, but it is not a

00:25:12.435 --> 00:25:13.703
magical weapon.

00:25:13.703 --> 00:25:20.476
MATT: It is not, so it is less affected by the
wound as it strikes through its body. You see it

00:25:20.476 --> 00:25:24.987
tear through some of the material and part of the
matter. The energy disperses the moment of impact.

00:25:24.987 --> 00:25:31.717
It damaged it, but something about it being
between the planes and its essence is making it

00:25:31.717 --> 00:25:36.222
not as effectively damageable with regular
weaponry.

00:25:36.222 --> 00:25:38.647
SAM: Hoo boy. What save were we making?

00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:40.131
MATT: That would be the wisdom save.

00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:40.938
TRAVIS: 17.

00:25:42.248 --> 00:25:43.939
MARISHA: Natural one?

00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:47.813
LIAM: 14.

00:25:48.763 --> 00:25:49.878
SAM: Natural one.

00:25:49.878 --> 00:25:51.771
(cheering)

00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:52.310
TRAVIS: Really?

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.518
LAURA: 12.

00:25:56.218 --> 00:25:56.832
TALIESIN: 25.

00:25:56.832 --> 00:25:58.038
ASHLEY: Eight!

00:25:58.038 --> 00:26:01.555
TRAVIS and LAURA: We're in so much trouble!

00:26:01.555 --> 00:26:03.824
ASHLEY: Guys, we're doing fine.

00:26:04.498 --> 00:26:12.052
MATT: Beau, Jester, Yasha, and Nott. As this faint
energy begins to disperse throughout the chamber,

00:26:12.052 --> 00:26:17.268
you hear thousands of voices trying to whisper
into your ears simultaneously. They're not making

00:26:17.268 --> 00:26:22.489
sense, and as they weave, your whole body begins
to go catatonic. Your muscles tense and you fall

00:26:22.489 --> 00:26:25.234
to your knees. You're all paralyzed until the end
of your next turn.

00:26:25.234 --> 00:26:29.576
TRAVIS: Oh no! We're in big trouble, you guys.

00:26:29.576 --> 00:26:32.732
MATT: It's going to fly up and back.

00:26:32.732 --> 00:26:37.940
LAURA: Wait, I have a question. When we're
paralyzed, does that mean every attack against us

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.236
is a critical?

00:26:39.236 --> 00:26:54.897
MATT: Every melee is, if it hits. That ends its
turn. That brings us to Beau. You're paralyzed, so

00:26:54.897 --> 00:27:01.260
at the end of your turn it fades. Sorry, not
paralyzed, stunned. It's not paralyzed. It's stunned.

00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:02.521
MARISHA: Stunned.

00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:05.316
MATT: Correct. It is not-- I had to read--

00:27:05.871 --> 00:27:06.867
MARISHA: What can I do?

00:27:06.867 --> 00:27:09.722
MATT: Stunned means you can't really do anything
this turn, but half make a sentence. You're aware

00:27:09.722 --> 00:27:13.210
of your surroundings but you can't take actions or
move. At the end of your turn, it wears off.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:22.590
MARISHA: I'm going to be like: The fire and ice
from the book and the lost sword and all that

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.764
shit, remember?

00:27:24.764 --> 00:27:26.199
MATT: That ends Beau's turn?

00:27:26.199 --> 00:27:26.805
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:27:26.805 --> 00:27:28.079
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:33.059
LIAM: Seeing how terrible everything is around me
I stick a quivering hand into my pocket and pull

00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:38.824
out a little copper wire. I learned how to do this
from Nott. I cup it in my hands, and I cast

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:46.713
Message to the thing. I'm going to text you what
I'm-- only it can hear me and I'm sending it to you.

00:27:46.713 --> 00:27:48.508
SAM: Digital whispers!

00:27:48.508 --> 00:27:54.926
LIAM: While backing against the wall behind me.

00:27:54.926 --> 00:28:05.278
MATT: You back up against the wall there. That
ends your turn, Caleb?

00:28:05.907 --> 00:28:10.554
LIAM: I will send Frumpkin skittering down by
Yasha's feet.

00:28:14.474 --> 00:28:19.338
MATT: Jester and Molly. Jester, you are no longer
stunned. That is your turn.

00:28:19.338 --> 00:28:20.398
LAURA: Okay, I'm done.

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:21.064
MATT: Molly.

00:28:21.064 --> 00:28:24.831
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and break the pot in
through the cage. I'm going to take a swipe at the

00:28:24.831 --> 00:28:26.485
pot through the cage with my sword.

00:28:26.485 --> 00:28:32.045
MATT: Okay. The cage, because the slits are very
small, you cannot get your full hand in there, so

00:28:32.045 --> 00:28:35.826
with the blade there you might be able to get it,
so make an attack roll with disadvantage.

00:28:40.236 --> 00:28:41.044
TALIESIN: Nine?

00:28:41.044 --> 00:28:48.491
MATT: Just misses. You strike the outside of it,
but the blow-- you watch as the urn (rocking in place).

00:28:48.491 --> 00:28:50.296
TALIESIN: I'm going to swing around and try to get
another shot.

00:28:50.296 --> 00:28:52.171
MATT: You pull it out and jab once more towards
it.

00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:57.499
TALIESIN: Stop doing that! You'll get everyone
drunk. Even worse. That's actually a natural one.

00:28:57.499 --> 00:29:00.244
LAURA: They're making so much money tonight!

00:29:00.244 --> 00:29:01.130
MATT: Apparently.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.138
ASHLEY: That's already $500.

00:29:02.138 --> 00:29:08.033
MATT: As your blades are getting caught in the
cage and try to pull it out, the large wisp is

00:29:08.033 --> 00:29:10.197
slowly pushing towards your body.

00:29:10.197 --> 00:29:20.854
TALIESIN: I'm going to run towards-- I'm in combat
with it. It gets an attack of opportunity if I

00:29:20.854 --> 00:29:27.125
run, doesn't it? I'm going to steady myself and
prepare for another attack.

00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:28.177
MATT: Fjord.

00:29:28.887 --> 00:29:30.425
TALIESIN: Nott, deal with this!

00:29:30.425 --> 00:29:36.871
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Eldritch Blast into the
pot in the bottom of the cage.

00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:40.865
MATT: Okay, with disadvantage because you're
aiming through the smaller space. It actually has

00:29:40.865 --> 00:29:44.472
cover. It's largely just a small space you're
shooting through.

00:29:44.472 --> 00:29:48.278
TRAVIS: That's not going to hit, that's a three
plus-- 11.

00:29:48.278 --> 00:29:49.395
MATT: 11 does hit.

00:29:49.395 --> 00:29:53.614
TRAVIS: Oh does it? Wait I added that wrong; hold
on. (stuttering) I'm pretty sure I added that wrong.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.784
LIAM: (Porky Pig stuttering)

00:29:55.784 --> 00:29:57.188
MATT: Your spell attack modifier.

00:29:57.188 --> 00:29:58.524
TRAVIS: Yeah no, that's only a nine.

00:29:58.524 --> 00:30:02.163
MATT: Yeah that doesn't hit, unfortunately. You're
trying to shoot the remainder and manage to hit

00:30:02.163 --> 00:30:05.704
the bar, and the bar bends back a little bit from
the impact of the blast. However, it's not

00:30:05.704 --> 00:30:07.645
actually hitting the urn on the inside.

00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:12.036
TRAVIS: Great, cool, awesome. Can I run? Can I use
my speed-- are they both in melee range?

00:30:12.036 --> 00:30:13.534
MATT: Yes, they are.

00:30:13.534 --> 00:30:20.481
TRAVIS: (high pitched laugh) Okay. 
I'll stay right where I am, then.

00:30:20.481 --> 00:30:27.139
MATT: All right, Fjord. Top of the round again.
Nott, you manage to (grunt) shrug off the stun,

00:30:27.139 --> 00:30:29.153
but that's the end of your turn.

00:30:29.153 --> 00:30:31.727
SAM: Oh, great. I'm sorry I couldn't help.

00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:37.725
MATT: Yasha, you shrug off the stun. That's the
end of your turn. All right.

00:30:37.725 --> 00:30:40.037
ASHLEY: Okay. Ah fuck.

00:30:40.037 --> 00:30:48.204
MATT: With that, all the wisps begin to close in
once more on their targets. Molly, that's a 23.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.884
TALIESIN: That's a number. Yeah, that hits.

00:30:50.884 --> 00:30:58.690
MATT: You take six points of lightning damage as
it shocks you from the side, again. The other one

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.696
striking against you, Nott. That is going to be a
15 to hit.

00:31:02.696 --> 00:31:03.994
SAM: 16.

00:31:03.994 --> 00:31:08.830
MATT: 16 armor class! You manage to duck out of
the way of this one as well. This one is beginning

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.619
to flicker angrily, as it can't seem to grasp and
tear any sort of life force from you with shock.

00:31:12.619 --> 00:31:13.384
SAM: No, get away!

00:31:13.384 --> 00:31:18.051
MATT: Two against you Fjord. That is a ten, six
plus four.

00:31:18.051 --> 00:31:18.859
TRAVIS: Misses.

00:31:18.859 --> 00:31:21.018
MATT: Misses. The other one is a 16.

00:31:21.018 --> 00:31:22.795
TRAVIS: (stuttering) That hits.

00:31:22.795 --> 00:31:27.222
MATT: That's five points of lightning damage.

00:31:27.222 --> 00:31:31.635
TRAVIS: Ten points of cold damage to that
particular wispy bastard.

00:31:31.635 --> 00:31:41.290
MATT: Which it takes a reduced amount. That ends
their turn. Now we'll see if the Howling Babble--

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:47.261
It does not regenerate that ability. It does not
recharge it. Now as the spectral entity begins to

00:31:47.261 --> 00:31:52.436
fly back towards this side, it's going to shift
over in this direction. We're going to say that

00:31:52.436 --> 00:31:57.560
it's gliding up near this pillar here. It's about
20 feet up, right by where the ceiling is, and

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.704
it's glaring down at everybody.

00:31:59.704 --> 00:32:01.639
SAM: He doesn't make an attack or anything?

00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:02.821
LAURA: He's about to.

00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:03.875
SAM: Oh shit, oh man.

00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:11.093
MATT: It's going to go ahead and use-- Actually,
it's not, because you're all too far away.

00:32:11.093 --> 00:32:17.273
Instead, it's going to coast down towards the one
that struck at it last turn. Rush right there.

00:32:17.273 --> 00:32:21.307
LAURA: Are his robes floating around him all cool
like a Nazgûl?

00:32:21.307 --> 00:32:26.278
MATT: Between that and a Deathly Hallow look, but
even more intense. Like an epic Deathly Hallow.

00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:30.684
It's going to go ahead and attempt a Maddening
Touch against you, Yasha.

00:32:30.684 --> 00:32:33.962
SAM: She's already raging. She's mad.

00:32:33.962 --> 00:32:36.718
MATT: That is a 16 to hit.

00:32:36.718 --> 00:32:37.385
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:32:37.385 --> 00:32:48.561
MATT: All right. You suffer-- that's actually a
really shitty roll for him. Nine points of psychic damage.

00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:51.437
TALIESIN: Hmm, that's a shitty roll.

00:32:51.437 --> 00:32:55.242
MATT: Plus three. Sorry, 12 points of psychic
damage.

00:32:55.242 --> 00:32:58.927
LAURA: That's a less shitty roll.

00:32:58.927 --> 00:33:02.607
MATT: Then it's going to go ahead and attempt to
fly back up into where it was, in the ceiling

00:33:02.607 --> 00:33:04.847
after it makes its strike.

00:33:04.847 --> 00:33:07.068
LAURA: All I'm hearing in my head is Careless
Whisper now.

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:09.320
TALIESIN: Do you get an attack of opportunity?

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.619
TRAVIS: Doesn't she have Sentinel?

00:33:11.619 --> 00:33:13.250
MATT: Oh you would get an attack of opportunity
against it.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.929
MARISHA: Yes, Sentinel!

00:33:13.929 --> 00:33:18.512
MATT: That's right, Sentinel feat! Oh, this might
fuck it up. As it comes down and strikes at you,

00:33:18.512 --> 00:33:25.370
you feel this burst of maddening intent shower
into your head. It sparks your brain with this

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:30.395
horrible searing pain. You guys watch as Yasha
screams out and begins to withdraw. With that, she

00:33:30.395 --> 00:33:34.427
all of a sudden clicks back into reality and
swings wide with the sword. What did you roll?

00:33:34.427 --> 00:33:34.921
ASHLEY: 18.

00:33:34.921 --> 00:33:36.345
MATT: 18 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

00:33:36.345 --> 00:33:37.317
(cheering)

00:33:39.207 --> 00:33:42.215
MATT: Which means he can't move. The Sentinel feat
prevents him from moving.

00:33:42.215 --> 00:33:43.666
TRAVIS: Boom! Speed is zero.

00:33:43.666 --> 00:33:46.437
ASHLEY: Can I also add Divine Fury on--

00:33:46.437 --> 00:33:50.077
MATT: Yes, you may. Could have done that last
round, too, but forgot.

00:33:50.568 --> 00:33:51.377
ASHLEY: I know.

00:33:51.377 --> 00:33:52.565
SAM: Shut up, Matt.

00:33:52.565 --> 00:33:55.751
(laughter)

00:33:55.751 --> 00:33:57.792
TRAVIS: Plus five, for your strength and rage.

00:33:57.792 --> 00:34:02.363
ASHLEY: (counting) Plus what?

00:34:02.363 --> 00:34:03.329
TRAVIS: Plus five.

00:34:03.329 --> 00:34:05.574
MATT: Yeah, with your rage, it's whatever you
rolled plus five and then plus half your level.

00:34:05.574 --> 00:34:06.523
Plus seven, technically.

00:34:06.523 --> 00:34:07.210
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:07.783
ASHLEY: 11.

00:34:07.783 --> 00:34:08.866
TRAVIS: Is that a divine thing?

00:34:08.866 --> 00:34:16.596
ASHLEY: Whoa, what's happening in my brain? 13.
Plus seven you said? 20.

00:34:16.596 --> 00:34:25.836
MATT: 20 points of-- oh man that's nasty. As it
tries to pull away, you click back into reality

00:34:25.836 --> 00:34:30.258
and swing wide with your sword. As you do, you cut
right through the center of its body, out the

00:34:30.258 --> 00:34:35.046
other end. You watch as the robe splinters open.
You see this glowing pulse of dark energy in the

00:34:35.046 --> 00:34:41.553
center. As it (guttural wail) it has to fight to
reform, its semi-corporeal form. It looks like

00:34:41.553 --> 00:34:43.397
it's hurt pretty bad.

00:34:43.397 --> 00:34:45.583
SAM: Oh man. Nice.

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:48.195
MATT: Yasha, that ends your turn?

00:34:48.195 --> 00:34:51.496
ASHLEY: That was my attack of opportunity.

00:34:51.496 --> 00:34:55.122
MATT: Oh that's right! It was an attack of
opportunity. Sorry, that was the creature's turn.

00:34:55.122 --> 00:34:56.237
Beau, you're up.

00:34:56.237 --> 00:35:02.361
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to-- I'm good, right? I'm
going to run up and pull out that holy water that

00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:08.202
I didn't use before. I'm going to parkour off of
Yasha's shoulder and spike it right at his feet.

00:35:08.202 --> 00:35:13.793
MATT: All righty, go ahead and roll your ranged
attack. d20 plus your proficiency.

00:35:13.793 --> 00:35:17.061
MARISHA: Okay, I don't know if that's good, 16.

00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:19.716
MATT: That hits. Roll 2d6.

00:35:19.716 --> 00:35:22.235
ASHLEY: I'll make my body all strong.

00:35:22.235 --> 00:35:23.843
MARISHA: Eight.

00:35:23.843 --> 00:35:32.000
MATT: It takes eight points of radiant damage as
it splashes on its form. The flames suddenly begin

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.404
to ignite across the front of its cloaked
exterior. Because holy flames are licking up the

00:35:36.404 --> 00:35:39.567
side of it and burning and it's (rasping cry).

00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:46.627
MARISHA: Okay, I still have my opportunity attack?
I mean my-- Sorry, my secondary attack.

00:35:46.627 --> 00:35:54.702
MATT: It's a ranged attack roll. I'll say sure.
Usually you get the bonus on a punch. You have to

00:35:54.702 --> 00:35:55.937
move up to do it though.

00:35:55.937 --> 00:36:01.286
MARISHA: I did move up. I said I ran up next to
Yasha and spiked it. I parkoured off her

00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:02.405
shoulders, spiked it.

00:36:02.405 --> 00:36:03.323
MATT: Sure. Good call.

00:36:03.323 --> 00:36:04.585
MARISHA: I want to do flurry of blows.

00:36:04.585 --> 00:36:07.547
MATT: Two more punch attacks or unarmed.

00:36:12.227 --> 00:36:17.236
MARISHA: 19 and 15 to hit.

00:36:17.236 --> 00:36:19.417
MATT: Both of those hit.

00:36:19.417 --> 00:36:22.772
MARISHA: That is an additional six-- Sorry, 12
damage.

00:36:22.772 --> 00:36:26.471
MATT: 12 damage. You rush up off the shoulder
after slamming it against the ground. You come up

00:36:26.471 --> 00:36:31.651
with a punch and an uppercut from underneath. As
your fists impact, it's like punching through

00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:38.040
heavy, cold cloth. You feel like almost you're
punching nothing as you do. While you're

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.637
impacting, you're not sure how much damage it's
doing. (whoosh)

00:36:42.637 --> 00:36:43.431
MARISHA: Okay, that's fair.

00:36:43.431 --> 00:36:45.508
MATT: That ends your turn, Beau. Caleb, you're
up.

00:36:45.508 --> 00:36:49.142
LIAM: I didn't see any difference in it when I did
what I did, <i>ja</i>?

00:36:49.142 --> 00:36:51.682
MATT: You didn't seem to notice anything.

00:36:51.682 --> 00:36:54.517
LIAM: How close could I get to it, if I wanted to
walk straight at it?

00:36:54.517 --> 00:36:56.174
MATT: You could get right up to it.

00:36:56.174 --> 00:36:59.746
LIAM: Right up to it. Could I get right behind--
No, I'll get right up to it, <i>ja</i>.

00:36:59.746 --> 00:37:03.974
MATT: All right. You can get right there.

00:37:03.974 --> 00:37:13.628
LIAM: Yeah, okay. I'm going to cast Burning Hands,
veered away so that it does not touch Yasha. It

00:37:13.628 --> 00:37:15.902
has to make a dexterity saving throw.

00:37:15.902 --> 00:37:17.223
MATT: It's a 15 foot cone, correct?

00:37:17.223 --> 00:37:17.743
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:37:17.743 --> 00:37:27.103
MATT: You can, from the edge of where you'd be
would be there, you can technically-- No, it would

00:37:27.103 --> 00:37:29.077
not quite hit that, but you can hit the creature.

00:37:29.077 --> 00:37:30.031
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, the creature is fine.

00:37:30.031 --> 00:37:32.630
MATT: It makes its save. That is a seven.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.343
LIAM: It's 3d6, halved.

00:37:34.343 --> 00:37:34.905
MATT: What's up?

00:37:34.905 --> 00:37:35.547
LIAM: Did it make it?

00:37:35.547 --> 00:37:37.461
MATT: It rolled a seven on its DC, so no.

00:37:37.461 --> 00:37:43.059
LIAM: Oh, no. It did not make it. It takes 11
points.

00:37:43.059 --> 00:37:49.617
MATT: 11, okay. Half of that. The fire doesn't
seem to have as much impact. Largely because of

00:37:50.044 --> 00:37:55.393
its ghostly form, most things it seems to be
resistant towards, but it's still taking damage as

00:37:55.393 --> 00:37:59.321
you're doing this. Now it's being flanked from all
of you guys. That ends Caleb's turn. Jester,

00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:00.562
Molly, you're up.

00:38:00.562 --> 00:38:02.875
TALIESIN: Pots, people, pots?

00:38:02.875 --> 00:38:07.068
LAURA: I mean, we should take those out too.

00:38:07.068 --> 00:38:14.186
TALIESIN: I'm useless on the pots. I'm actually
going to try and make a book for the cloaked guy.

00:38:14.186 --> 00:38:17.695
I'm going to yelling at everyone: Hit the pots!
Hit the bloody pots!

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:20.875
MATT: (counting) You have to get over here to--

00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:21.873
TALIESIN: That's fine.

00:38:21.873 --> 00:38:24.122
TRAVIS: Who has that sword we pulled off?

00:38:24.122 --> 00:38:24.963
LIAM: Jester.

00:38:24.963 --> 00:38:29.458
MATT: First off, the will-o'-wisp makes a strike
at you, attack of opportunity.

00:38:29.458 --> 00:38:31.356
MARISHA: I bet he wants his sword back.

00:38:31.356 --> 00:38:32.142
MATT: 18.

00:38:32.142 --> 00:38:32.794
TALIESIN: That hits.

00:38:32.794 --> 00:38:39.475
MATT: As you rush past, 16 points of lightning
damage.

00:38:39.475 --> 00:38:40.637
TALIESIN: Oh my god, really!?

00:38:40.637 --> 00:38:48.419
MATT: I rolled double eights on d8s. The
will-o'-wisp suddenly, as you try to rush, it

00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:52.980
actually darts in front of you. You run towards
it, and it actually passes through your entire

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:58.152
torso. As it does, shocking your lungs and heart,
and for a second your heart doesn't beat. Then

00:38:58.152 --> 00:39:01.877
kicks back in. Your whole body feels cold, but you
keep running. You push past Caleb and get right up

00:39:01.877 --> 00:39:03.420
next to the creature.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.007
TRAVIS: Need a defib.

00:39:04.007 --> 00:39:12.930
TALIESIN: Yeah. Pots, people. I'm going to take
two strikes with the radiant swords. That's a 15

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.547
to hit.

00:39:13.547 --> 00:39:14.485
MATT: 15 hits.

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.739
TALIESIN: An eight to hit.

00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:17.118
MATT: Eight does not hit, unfortunately.

00:39:17.118 --> 00:39:18.314
TALIESIN: Okay, that's all right.

00:39:18.314 --> 00:39:22.043
MATT: The pain is too strong on one strike and you
go wide, but you turn around and all of a sudden

00:39:22.043 --> 00:39:25.744
there's a moment of clarity. As the pain clicks
in, you clench your jaw and swing back, striking true.

00:39:25.747 --> 00:39:32.542
TALIESIN: Does it do extra radiant damage? I mean,
because I do an extra bonus radiant damage, if it

00:39:32.983 --> 00:39:33.598
takes it.

00:39:33.598 --> 00:39:37.072
MATT: You do the extra three anyway, because it's
undead.

00:39:37.072 --> 00:39:43.075
TALIESIN: Oh, so yeah. That's (counting) 11 points
of radiant damage.

00:39:43.075 --> 00:39:48.279
MATT: How much is the sword? How much is the
radiant?

00:39:48.279 --> 00:39:52.191
TALIESIN: Six is radiant, and the rest is the
sword.

00:39:52.191 --> 00:39:56.465
MATT: Five, all right, cool. It takes less damage
from the swords, but the radiant does go through.

00:39:56.465 --> 00:40:02.104
It's looking pretty beat up at this point now.
Between the different attacks you've done it's

00:40:02.104 --> 00:40:08.492
starting to freak out now. It's trying to figure
out how best to deal with its situation. That ends

00:40:08.797 --> 00:40:10.004
your turn, Molly; Jester, what are you doing?

00:40:10.004 --> 00:40:17.764
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my symbol of the
Traveler, and I'm going to say: Okay, I hope

00:40:17.764 --> 00:40:21.783
you're with me right now, because I really need
your help! I'm going to try to Turn Undead.

00:40:21.783 --> 00:40:23.965
MATT: From where you're standing?

00:40:23.965 --> 00:40:26.228
LAURA: No, I'm going to jump up behind Frumpkin.

00:40:26.228 --> 00:40:29.192
MATT: You dart over this direction. What's the
radius on that, 30 feet?

00:40:29.192 --> 00:40:30.012
LAURA: 30 feet.

00:40:30.012 --> 00:40:35.287
MATT: That'll catch all three of those and the
guy. Was it wisdom saves against your spell DC?

00:40:35.287 --> 00:40:36.695
LAURA: Wisdom save, yes.

00:40:36.695 --> 00:40:40.719
TRAVIS: I don't really like my position right
now.

00:40:40.719 --> 00:40:42.471
MATT: No, you're in a bad place.

00:40:42.471 --> 00:40:45.416
LAURA: It has to make a wisdom saving throw, yes.

00:40:45.416 --> 00:40:56.120
MATT: Far end will-o'-wisp right there, that would
be a six. No. That one, nope. That one over there

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:06.222
is going to attempt as well. That's a nine. No, so
that one is also turned. The one over there is

00:41:06.222 --> 00:41:12.320
fleeing. That is going to be a 16. That does
succeed?

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.508
LAURA: 16 succeeds.

00:41:13.508 --> 00:41:22.380
MATT: The main guy, natural 20. These two wisps
now are slightly-- you rush up, and you pray for a

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.334
second and hope. You know this inspiration hits
you. As you clasp the symbol, suddenly the strange

00:41:27.334 --> 00:41:33.720
little archway on the top of the symbol begins to
glow. There's this large burst of deep blue energy

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.312
that radiates outward. As it strikes, it washes
over the main creature with no effect. As it hits

00:41:38.312 --> 00:41:43.798
the two other side will-o'-wisps, both of them
shiver and begin to shift away. Looking like

00:41:43.798 --> 00:41:49.016
they're actually running in fear, as fast as they
can from Jester, in the center. That's your action.

00:41:49.016 --> 00:42:00.514
LAURA: That's my action, and for my bonus action,
I'm going to cast Sanctuary on-- who's the lowest?

00:42:01.064 --> 00:42:01.859
SAM: (whispering) You.

00:42:01.859 --> 00:42:02.654
LAURA: On myself.

00:42:02.654 --> 00:42:06.406
(laughter)

00:42:06.406 --> 00:42:08.214
TRAVIS: Aw, that was so considerate.

00:42:08.214 --> 00:42:10.009
MATT: Not too bad.

00:42:10.009 --> 00:42:12.893
TRAVIS: Who's the lowest? Blood coming out of her
mouth.

00:42:12.893 --> 00:42:16.584
SAM: (as Jester) I'm trying to be a good healer,
but me.

00:42:16.584 --> 00:42:22.593
MATT: Fair enough. You have Sanctuary on you right
now. Jester, that ends your turn. Fjord, you're up.

00:42:22.593 --> 00:42:27.506
TRAVIS: Yeah, well this is a bitch, ain't it. I'm
going to try Eldritch Blast again at the pot,

00:42:27.506 --> 00:42:32.388
through the cage. At disadvantage, because I got
to take one of those out of the picture somehow.

00:42:32.388 --> 00:42:34.821
Oh, I think that might work, 14.

00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:36.844
MATT: 14 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

00:42:36.844 --> 00:42:44.733
TRAVIS: Outstanding. That is a big plus for me.
Ten plus four, 14!

00:42:44.733 --> 00:42:51.892
MATT: With that, that one pot shatters. The ash
explodes in a small cloud, pushing on the side of

00:42:51.892 --> 00:42:56.835
the wall behind the cage. That one wisp next to
you flitters out of existence.

00:42:56.835 --> 00:43:01.054
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I move my Hex
onto el shadow figure?

00:43:01.742 --> 00:43:03.136
MATT: You can.

00:43:03.136 --> 00:43:05.597
TRAVIS: Disadvantage on wisdom saving throws.

00:43:05.597 --> 00:43:07.596
MATT: Oh, wisdom ability checks, not saving
throws.

00:43:07.596 --> 00:43:08.505
TRAVIS: Wisdom ability checks, thank you.

00:43:08.505 --> 00:43:13.427
MATT: Disadvantage on wisdom ability checks. That
ends your turn Fjord?

00:43:13.427 --> 00:43:14.435
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

00:43:14.435 --> 00:43:15.594
MATT: Nott, you're up.

00:43:15.594 --> 00:43:19.734
SAM: There's four pots? Now there's three. Can I
see any of them from where--

00:43:20.292 --> 00:43:23.234
MATT: You can. Inside the cage you can see one
there, and you assume there's one in there because

00:43:23.234 --> 00:43:25.044
you saw Molly going towards it.

00:43:25.044 --> 00:43:30.900
SAM: I will shoot one of the pots with my hand
crossbow.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.741
MATT: Which you can do without disadvantage,
because of your feat.

00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:35.851
SAM: Yeah, a lot, 22.

00:43:35.851 --> 00:43:41.030
MATT: Well you still have disadvantage to try and
fire at it, because it's in the cage. Sorry, I

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.487
just realized. It's in the cage.

00:43:42.487 --> 00:43:45.464
TALIESIN: Doesn't he have crossbow advantage?

00:43:45.464 --> 00:43:49.051
MATT: That's for melee stuff. This is it being
covered, and you're aiming through these tiny

00:43:49.051 --> 00:43:50.354
holes as you're firing at it.

00:43:50.354 --> 00:43:51.766
SAM: It has half-cover or something?

00:43:51.766 --> 00:43:57.712
MATT: Well essentially. Yeah, I'd say at this
close it has three-quarters cover. It's a plus

00:43:57.712 --> 00:43:59.578
five to its AC. What did you roll?

00:43:59.578 --> 00:44:01.796
SAM: The first roll was 22.

00:44:01.796 --> 00:44:04.766
MATT: Yeah, it hits. We'll say it hits, because
you're right up against it with a crossbow. You're

00:44:04.766 --> 00:44:08.258
not having to aim in with it. You're (bolt
flying). Roll the damage.

00:44:08.258 --> 00:44:11.515
SAM: Six points of damage.

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:16.559
MATT: Six is enough. The pots aren't very strong;
it's just hard to touch (shattering). That

00:44:16.559 --> 00:44:19.259
will-o'-wisp manages to discorporate next to you.

00:44:19.259 --> 00:44:30.122
SAM: Eight is Enough. I'll skitter around towards
the candelabra over there, and as I go I'll (cocks

00:44:30.122 --> 00:44:33.912
crossbow) and fire another shot at the other pot.

00:44:33.912 --> 00:44:37.847
MATT: Okay, that one you do have disadvantage on
as you're farther away from it.

00:44:37.847 --> 00:44:38.538
SAM: 19.

00:44:38.538 --> 00:44:40.986
MATT: 19 still hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:44:40.986 --> 00:44:42.778
TRAVIS: Sharpshooter!

00:44:42.778 --> 00:44:44.484
SAM: That one's seven points of damage.

00:44:44.484 --> 00:44:46.655
MATT: That pot shatters.

00:44:46.655 --> 00:44:47.489
SAM: No look.

00:44:47.489 --> 00:44:51.007
(laughter)

00:44:51.007 --> 00:44:52.018
TALIESIN: You're going to be all right, Fjord?

00:44:52.018 --> 00:44:54.568
TRAVIS: It's cool. There's actually one wisp
actually next to somebody. Thank you.

00:44:54.568 --> 00:44:56.096
SAM: Oh. Whoops!

00:44:56.096 --> 00:45:03.518
LAURA: It was also the only wisp that wasn't
affected by the Turn Undead. Where did that

00:45:03.518 --> 00:45:05.062
confetti come from?

00:45:05.062 --> 00:45:06.781
MATT: That was left over from your welcome party.

00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:09.739
LAURA: Oh, I missed your welcome party.

00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:11.298
MATT: Yasha, it's your turn.

00:45:11.298 --> 00:45:15.669
ASHLEY: Okay! I'm going to attack him again.

00:45:15.669 --> 00:45:17.329
MATT: Go for it.

00:45:19.259 --> 00:45:20.478
TRAVIS: Carve this turkey.

00:45:22.508 --> 00:45:25.015
ASHLEY: Yes! 19.

00:45:25.015 --> 00:45:26.682
MATT: That hits; roll damage.

00:45:29.202 --> 00:45:30.852
LAURA: Are you going to do your thing?

00:45:31.492 --> 00:45:32.671
ASHLEY: All the stuffs?

00:45:32.671 --> 00:45:33.990
LAURA: All the stuff.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:39.776
SAM: Rage! Reckless! Endangerment! Diviney!

00:45:40.466 --> 00:45:42.243
LAURA: That's a good name for it.

00:45:42.243 --> 00:45:43.649
ASHLEY: 14.

00:45:43.649 --> 00:45:52.178
MATT: 14. As you swing past with the sword and arc
upward, you cut through and its cloak cannot hold

00:45:52.178 --> 00:45:57.572
back together. There's now this giant opening
where this vacuous, cold heartbeat glows, visible

00:45:57.572 --> 00:46:04.085
from the inside, and its body is flickering,
having a hard time keeping itself together on this

00:46:04.085 --> 00:46:06.952
side of reality. Does this end your turn, Yasha?

00:46:06.952 --> 00:46:12.091
ASHLEY: Yeah. The little interior bit, what is it
again?

00:46:12.091 --> 00:46:15.892
MATT: You see this dull, blue glow that's now
visible from where you struck through it. It looks

00:46:15.892 --> 00:46:17.365
like it's falling apart.

00:46:17.365 --> 00:46:19.110
LAURA: (shouting) Steal his heart! Take his
heart!

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.333
MATT: Yasha, that ends your turn?

00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:23.189
ASHLEY: Can I punch it?

00:46:23.465 --> 00:46:27.938
MATT: Unfortunately, no. You've already used your
action. That's what a monk does. Just a little flick--

00:46:28.161 --> 00:46:28.911
ASHLEY: All done.

00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:37.691
MATT: That ends Yasha's turn. Now the one wisp
that's by you is going to shift through the wall

00:46:37.691 --> 00:46:43.181
onto this side and is going to make a strike at
you, Fjord. That is a 16 to hit.

00:46:43.181 --> 00:46:43.972
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:46:43.972 --> 00:46:51.055
MATT: That is 12 points of lightning damage to
you.

00:46:51.055 --> 00:46:55.472
TRAVIS: Whoa, that was a big one. Shit, okay.

00:46:55.472 --> 00:47:08.956
MATT: As it shocks through you, and you fall to
one knee for a moment. It's going to shift into

00:47:08.956 --> 00:47:12.035
that pillar and vanish. You do get an attack of
opportunity on it as it leaves your range.

00:47:12.035 --> 00:47:13.741
TRAVIS: Disadvantage, or regular?

00:47:13.741 --> 00:47:14.373
MATT: Regular.

00:47:14.373 --> 00:47:18.705
TRAVIS: 14.

00:47:18.705 --> 00:47:22.993
MATT: 14 does not hit. You go to strike, and
unfortunately it just makes it into the pillar and

00:47:22.993 --> 00:47:29.770
you hit stone and sparks off of it. It does take
one point of force damage from spending its turn

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:36.860
inside the wall. Now it is the entity's turn. It
is going to attempt-- we'll see if its Howling

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:40.439
Babble returns. It gets its Howling Babble back.

00:47:40.439 --> 00:47:42.747
TALIESIN: We're all right here.

00:47:42.747 --> 00:47:50.663
MATT: Oh, man, I forgot that. I need all of you to
roll a wisdom saving throw, please.

00:47:50.663 --> 00:47:53.573
TRAVIS: Does that affect his wisdom ability
checks? The Hex?

00:47:53.573 --> 00:47:54.152
MATT: Nope.

00:47:54.152 --> 00:47:54.987
LIAM: Natural 20!

00:47:54.987 --> 00:47:55.892
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

00:47:57.252 --> 00:47:57.920
TRAVIS: 18.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.739
MARISHA: Ow, five.

00:48:00.739 --> 00:48:05.399
SAM: 11. Is his regeneration an ability check?

00:48:05.399 --> 00:48:08.502
MATT: No, there's no check for it. Beau, Nott--

00:48:10.492 --> 00:48:20.636
LAURA: Wait, don't you have to make a wisdom
saving throw against my Sanctuary? Because you did

00:48:20.636 --> 00:48:22.609
a harmful spell against me, right?

00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:24.199
MATT: Let me look at the--

00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:34.196
SAM: "Any creature who targets the warded creature
with an attack must first make a wisdom saving throw.

00:48:34.196 --> 00:48:39.514
MATT: It's not technically targeting the creature,
you're just in the radius of what's happening.

00:48:39.514 --> 00:48:42.991
SAM: "The spell doesn't protect the warded
creature from area effects."

00:48:42.991 --> 00:48:45.196
MATT: Unfortunately. What'd you roll?

00:48:45.196 --> 00:48:47.496
LAURA: I didn't roll anything yet.

00:48:47.496 --> 00:48:49.225
MATT: Well, now you get to roll.

00:48:50.245 --> 00:48:50.853
LAURA: Ten.

00:48:50.853 --> 00:48:51.575
MATT: No.

00:48:53.215 --> 00:48:53.884
TALIESIN: 18.

00:48:53.884 --> 00:48:55.615
ASHLEY: I rolled a four.

00:48:55.615 --> 00:48:56.215
MATT: No.

00:48:57.485 --> 00:48:59.530
ASHLEY: I was trying to see it as a positive
thing.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:07.445
MATT: First off, all of you guys who failed your
saving throw: Beau, Yasha, Jester, and Nott, you

00:49:07.875 --> 00:49:16.035
all suffer 14 points of psychic damage and you are
stunned until the end of your next turn.

00:49:16.035 --> 00:49:17.603
TRAVIS: That thing is a bitch.

00:49:17.603 --> 00:49:19.450
MATT: Jester's unconscious.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.816
TRAVIS: I've got one more with your name on it,
sweet cheeks.

00:49:23.816 --> 00:49:25.883
ASHLEY: Three hit points, guys. I've got three hit
points.

00:49:25.883 --> 00:49:31.662
MATT: It's going to attempt to slip into the
floor.

00:49:31.662 --> 00:49:34.136
TALIESIN: I get an attack of opportunity?

00:49:34.136 --> 00:49:37.481
MATT: You and Caleb both get an attack of
opportunity, <i>physically</i>.

00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:38.444
ASHLEY: Do I?

00:49:38.444 --> 00:49:39.473
MATT: You're stunned.

00:49:39.473 --> 00:49:40.308
ASHLEY: Fuck!

00:49:40.308 --> 00:49:45.355
MATT: As it begins to shift into the ground.

00:49:45.355 --> 00:49:59.119
TALIESIN: That hits; that's 20. That's five points
of normal damage and five points of radiant damage.

00:49:59.119 --> 00:50:00.056
MATT: How do you want to do this?

00:50:00.056 --> 00:50:02.610
(cheering)

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:07.070
TALIESIN: I want to swing and pin the heart to the
ground and leave the blade there.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:13.754
MATT: As it tries to shift downward, Molly,
pulling back from the screams and strange howling

00:50:13.949 --> 00:50:18.580
babble emanating from its body, you swing wide,
spinning the blade in the air, and jam down on top

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:24.744
of its form. As you do, it disperses, like an
explosion of wind from the center. You watch the

00:50:24.744 --> 00:50:29.588
cloth of its body suddenly scatter, like someone
had blown a heavy wind into a stack of loose cloth

00:50:29.588 --> 00:50:35.457
that all eventually turns into ash and vanishes.
There, you see a dull blue glow where the sword is

00:50:35.457 --> 00:50:40.289
grinding against the stone, before that eventually
dissipates into nothingness.

00:50:40.289 --> 00:50:42.023
MARISHA: Yeah, ghostslayer!

00:50:42.023 --> 00:50:42.889
TALIESIN: Last pot!

00:50:42.889 --> 00:50:44.368
ASHLEY: Good job, Molly.

00:50:44.368 --> 00:50:48.095
MATT: Beau, your stun wears off.

00:50:48.095 --> 00:50:53.277
MARISHA: That guy knew way too much about
everything.

00:50:53.277 --> 00:50:54.024
MATT: Caleb.

00:50:54.024 --> 00:50:56.634
LIAM: Can I see that last pot from where I am?

00:50:56.634 --> 00:50:57.696
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:50:57.696 --> 00:51:04.630
LIAM: Okay, that is a 13.

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:14.682
MATT: 13? Glancing about in the area, with
torchlight from Yasha, you can see one visible pot

00:51:14.682 --> 00:51:16.683
that has not been shattered in that cage.

00:51:16.683 --> 00:51:20.617
LIAM: Okay, I will send a little Firebolt off and
try to strike it. It's at disadvantage, correct?

00:51:20.617 --> 00:51:28.885
Okay, that's very bad. Also very bad. That's a
ten.

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:35.415
MATT: A ten just barely misses. You attempt to
strike through, and it smashes against the wrought

00:51:35.415 --> 00:51:37.673
iron gate on the outside and disperses against
it.

00:51:37.673 --> 00:51:42.033
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I will walk toward it to get closer,
as much as I can.

00:51:42.033 --> 00:51:43.832
MATT: You can get right up to it if you want to.

00:51:43.832 --> 00:51:45.718
LIAM: I should have done that first, <i>ja</i>?

00:51:45.718 --> 00:51:50.191
MATT: That brings us to Jester and Molly.

00:51:50.191 --> 00:51:54.617
LAURA: I'm unconscious.

00:51:54.617 --> 00:51:57.708
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over to you and put a
healing--

00:51:57.708 --> 00:51:59.412
LAURA: Don't waste a healing potion on me!

00:51:59.412 --> 00:52:01.696
SAM: What else are we going to do? We can't heal!

00:52:01.696 --> 00:52:03.589
MATT: You can't say anything. You're unconscious.

00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:05.521
TRAVIS: You hush your mouth.

00:52:05.521 --> 00:52:07.391
LAURA: I have healing packs in my bag!

00:52:07.391 --> 00:52:11.235
TALIESIN: I don't care. I don't know any of that.
That's a healing potion.

00:52:11.235 --> 00:52:12.787
LAURA: I have doughnuts.

00:52:12.787 --> 00:52:21.421
TALIESIN: I'm going to go looking for one in one
second. Potion of healing, just a standard 2d4+2.

00:52:21.421 --> 00:52:27.189
So take six points of heal, you're stabilized.

00:52:27.189 --> 00:52:31.522
LAURA: (gasping) Molly!

00:52:31.522 --> 00:52:33.710
TALIESIN: Back up, come on!

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:38.153
LAURA: This is a bad day, you guys. Today is
really hard.

00:52:38.153 --> 00:52:39.665
MATT: Jester's now conscious.

00:52:39.665 --> 00:52:43.270
TALIESIN: I also, definitely lost my two swords
now, so those are off.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.628
MARISHA: Lost them?

00:52:45.628 --> 00:52:49.086
TALIESIN: The swords are not glowing anymore.

00:52:49.086 --> 00:52:51.432
MATT: You stopped their effect?

00:52:51.432 --> 00:52:54.492
TALIESIN: I had to feed a healing potion. I had
two going, so I needed hands.

00:52:54.492 --> 00:53:01.404
MATT: That brings us to Jester's turn, as you come
to consciousness, since you guys are on the same initiative.

00:53:05.504 --> 00:53:09.772
TALIESIN: You can do something, if you like. Pot!
Pot!

00:53:09.772 --> 00:53:13.219
LAURA: I guess I'll walk over and try to take out
the pot.

00:53:13.219 --> 00:53:20.448
MATT: That's half your movement to get up, and
then five, ten, 15, that's as far as you get.

00:53:20.448 --> 00:53:24.569
LAURA: Can I try to throw something at it?

00:53:24.569 --> 00:53:26.444
MATT: What do you have to throw?

00:53:26.444 --> 00:53:35.208
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think I have anything that
will fit through that little hole-- I could try

00:53:35.208 --> 00:53:38.455
picking up a rock on the ground and throwing it at
it.

00:53:38.455 --> 00:53:43.541
MATT: You can make an investigation check to try
and find a rock on the ground.

00:53:44.023 --> 00:53:53.070
LAURA: I probably don't see one. If I did, it
would take a whole lot of time!

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:55.041
MATT: Well, you took your action searching the
ground.

00:53:55.041 --> 00:53:55.587
LAURA: Three!

00:53:55.587 --> 00:54:01.432
MATT: You do not find a rock. You spend the better
part of six seconds going, "Wait! Ah, no it's a

00:54:01.432 --> 00:54:05.388
piece of black cloth, shit!" No actual stone,
unfortunately. Sorry, Jester.

00:54:05.388 --> 00:54:06.729
LAURA: No, it's fine.

00:54:06.729 --> 00:54:08.964
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

00:54:08.964 --> 00:54:15.008
TRAVIS: I'll spin around and try and Eldritch
Blast that last pot in the other cage. At

00:54:15.008 --> 00:54:17.193
disadvantage. That's a 19!

00:54:17.193 --> 00:54:18.574
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

00:54:18.574 --> 00:54:20.846
LAURA: I just woke up, you guys!

00:54:20.846 --> 00:54:25.503
TRAVIS: That's 11 points of damage!

00:54:25.503 --> 00:54:34.185
MATT: 11 points of damage, nice! With that, that
pot shatters, and you see this flicker in the

00:54:34.185 --> 00:54:39.271
stone column behind as the energy of the wisp
flares out from the side.

00:54:39.271 --> 00:54:40.181
TRAVIS: Got him.

00:54:40.181 --> 00:54:41.371
LAURA: Good job.

00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:44.345
MATT: Nott, Yasha, you guys doing anything?

00:54:44.345 --> 00:54:45.896
ASHLEY: I'm still stunned?

00:54:45.896 --> 00:54:49.505
MATT: No, actually your stun has worn off. Nott,
you doing anything? Oh! You're stunned as well.

00:54:49.505 --> 00:54:58.331
Your stun now wears off. As you guys finish
shaking off the energy, this cold energy begins to

00:54:58.331 --> 00:55:01.771
emerge from the far wall, through the bookcase.

00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:06.300
LAURA: Oh no! He's back? Okay, we run away.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:11.214
MATT: The same entity comes through the bookcase,
like it's emerging from something behind.

00:55:11.214 --> 00:55:14.244
LAURA: Grab his heart and run. From the ground.

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:16.016
TALIESIN: There was no heart on the ground

00:55:16.016 --> 00:55:18.665
MATT: As you struck it, the energy dispersed.

00:55:18.665 --> 00:55:19.736
LAURA: Let's run away.

00:55:19.736 --> 00:55:23.201
ASHLEY: What if we have to get it with the sword?

00:55:23.201 --> 00:55:25.815
LAURA: It's a two-handed weapon. I can't do it.

00:55:25.815 --> 00:55:27.125
MARISHA: Yasha can, though.

00:55:27.125 --> 00:55:28.974
TRAVIS: Why? You're strong! You can do it.

00:55:28.974 --> 00:55:31.144
LAURA: I can't use two-handed weapons.

00:55:31.144 --> 00:55:35.200
MATT: As you guys watch it push out of the wall,
(gasping sound) making its way there.

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.084
MARISHA: Wait! Maybe if we show it the sword,
he'll chill out.

00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:46.939
MATT: Caleb, make an intelligence check. You make
a religion check with advantage, because you have undead.

00:55:46.939 --> 00:55:48.507
LIAM: Just a straight intelligence?

00:55:48.507 --> 00:55:49.395
MATT: Straight intelligence modifier.

00:55:49.395 --> 00:55:50.048
LIAM: 15.

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:52.667
TALIESIN: 12.

00:55:52.667 --> 00:56:00.783
MATT: After reading through the notes and going
through the book, you recall that a lot of the

00:56:01.221 --> 00:56:06.391
magic in here entails binding the soul to the
remains of the physical form, as you've seen with

00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:12.007
all of the wisps. It is a similar return of the
entity you just fought.

00:56:12.007 --> 00:56:13.506
LAURA: Oh, his body's somewhere!

00:56:13.506 --> 00:56:17.219
MARISHA: Where's that corkscrew thing?

00:56:17.219 --> 00:56:22.078
MATT: On its turn, it's going to attempt-- first,
let's see if it gets its Howling Babble back. It

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:31.479
does not; it's a one. So it's going to try
Whispers of Madness again. I need only Yasha and

00:56:31.479 --> 00:56:34.139
Beau, actually. Everyone else is spread out. Yasha
and Beau, I need you both to make a wisdom saving

00:56:34.139 --> 00:56:38.823
throw as the whispers now begin to emanate from
its mouth.

00:56:38.823 --> 00:56:41.664
TALIESIN: It's coming from the bookcase.

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:45.449
MARISHA: That's better, 16?

00:56:45.449 --> 00:56:49.545
MATT: You watched it emerge through the bookcase.
16? Okay, Yasha?

00:56:49.545 --> 00:56:50.194
ASHLEY: Seven.

00:56:50.194 --> 00:56:51.583
MATT: Seven, so Beau--

00:56:51.583 --> 00:56:54.104
MARISHA: Wait, we have the book that we found in
the research center.

00:56:54.104 --> 00:56:58.992
MATT: Beau, you resist the whispers and close your
eyes, and as you come up to try to make this

00:56:58.992 --> 00:57:04.401
point, next thing you see is Yasha looking at you
and (swoosh) down with your sword. Make an attack

00:57:04.401 --> 00:57:05.918
against Beau.

00:57:05.918 --> 00:57:06.590
ASHLEY: Oh, shit.

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:07.506
TALIESIN: Do I see this?

00:57:07.506 --> 00:57:08.429
MATT: You do.

00:57:08.429 --> 00:57:13.239
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly cast before this
goes-- I don't know.

00:57:13.239 --> 00:57:14.683
MATT: Well, no, you got it.

00:57:14.683 --> 00:57:16.699
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast one level--

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:21.141
MATT: Your vision, as this happens, all of a
sudden goes black. You watch as this dark blood

00:57:21.141 --> 00:57:25.886
pools at the corners of Yasha's face, as you go
blind from his blood maledict. So roll with

00:57:25.886 --> 00:57:28.964
disadvantage on the attack.

00:57:28.964 --> 00:57:31.861
ASHLEY: Yeah! Disadvantage would mean it was--?

00:57:31.861 --> 00:57:33.124
MATT: Lowest one.

00:57:33.124 --> 00:57:39.097
ASHLEY: The lowest number, okay. I didn't know if
it-- okay, three. Oh, sorry, five. Six!

00:57:41.497 --> 00:57:46.707
MATT: You see it just in time and bat it out of
the way. It hits the stone next to you. You do

00:57:46.707 --> 00:57:49.589
suffer 11 points of psychic damage, however.

00:57:50.126 --> 00:57:51.351
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm unconscious?

00:57:51.351 --> 00:57:55.442
MATT: You watch as she swings at you, and the
impact, as you parry it, Yasha goes down with the

00:57:55.442 --> 00:57:57.454
blade swing, onto the ground.

00:57:57.454 --> 00:57:59.633
SAM: Did you just kill her?

00:57:59.633 --> 00:58:02.241
TALIESIN: Nope.

00:58:02.241 --> 00:58:09.405
ASHLEY: I do have, hold on-- I thought I had
something.

00:58:09.405 --> 00:58:12.516
MATT: There's an ability you get at later levels
that does something in this scenario.

00:58:12.516 --> 00:58:13.831
ASHLEY: It's not now?

00:58:13.831 --> 00:58:16.093
MATT: Don't think you have something for that
right now. I could be wrong.

00:58:16.093 --> 00:58:16.775
ASHLEY: I'm unconscious.

00:58:16.775 --> 00:58:18.768
MATT: I'll double check just to be safe.

00:58:18.768 --> 00:58:26.244
LIAM: The book said the soul is bound to the flesh
be it in any form, ice or ash, but the ash in the

00:58:26.244 --> 00:58:27.960
pots was the will-o'-wisp.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.879
MARISHA: It says, "From ashes I shall rise
again."

00:58:29.879 --> 00:58:31.648
LAURA: Maybe there's something behind the
bookcase?

00:58:31.648 --> 00:58:32.653
SAM: Let's go look!

00:58:32.653 --> 00:58:43.876
MATT: That ends the creature's turn. As that
happens, it's going to lift up and vanish into the

00:58:43.876 --> 00:58:49.905
ceiling. You watch it disappear out of place. It
does take force damage for being in the wall.

00:58:49.905 --> 00:59:03.311
That's actually a good roll, six force damage to
it. You have the divine energy, path zealot, and

00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:09.341
your soul is marked for battle-- the only ability
you have now is the warrior of the gods. You don't

00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:10.683
have the other one yet.

00:59:10.683 --> 00:59:11.440
ASHLEY: Right, okay.

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.512
MATT: That finishes its turn. Beau, you're up. You
watch Yasha slam on the ground, unconscious next

00:59:15.512 --> 00:59:21.669
to you, the blade clattering to the ground and
coming to rest. The creature lifts up (wheezing)

00:59:21.669 --> 00:59:23.834
and vanishes into the stone above you.

00:59:23.834 --> 00:59:25.265
MARISHA: I can't get a reaction from it, as it
goes?

00:59:25.265 --> 00:59:27.004
MATT: It was not close enough to you,
unfortunately.

00:59:27.004 --> 00:59:33.963
MARISHA: Fuck. I'm going to run over to this
bookcase and put my staff behind it to see if I

00:59:33.963 --> 00:59:35.553
can knock it over.

00:59:35.553 --> 00:59:40.613
MATT: You get the staff on the fulcrum. Go ahead
and make an athletics check to force it.

00:59:40.613 --> 00:59:44.965
TRAVIS: Come on! (singing) Get it, girl. Get it,
get it, girl.

00:59:44.965 --> 00:59:49.381
MARISHA: Fuck! That keeps happening! Six.

00:59:49.381 --> 00:59:55.469
MATT: You try and (grunt) and it's starting to
rock, but it's heavy. You start pushing. You can't

00:59:55.469 --> 00:59:59.123
quite get the bookcase to come over,
unfortunately. That ends your turn?

00:59:59.123 --> 01:00:00.322
MARISHA: I guess so.

01:00:00.322 --> 01:00:02.594
MATT: That brings us to Caleb.

01:00:02.594 --> 01:00:14.171
LIAM: I am going to start moving towards the
middle, towards Yasha. I don't have any healer's

01:00:14.171 --> 01:00:17.248
kit or anything. I don't know how to do anything
like that.

01:00:17.248 --> 01:00:19.566
ASHLEY: It's okay. Get the bookcase.

01:00:19.566 --> 01:00:21.511
SAM: You're going to die!

01:00:21.511 --> 01:00:31.184
LIAM: I'm going to hold my attack, a Fire Bolt.
Can I do that? I am a wizard for the first time.

01:00:31.184 --> 01:00:32.791
Can I hold a Fire Bolt?

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:35.754
MATT: You can hold it as an action. You're casting
the spell. Then whenever something triggers it,

01:00:35.754 --> 01:00:36.154
you release it.

01:00:36.154 --> 01:00:37.784
LIAM: Yeah, when it appears.

01:00:37.784 --> 01:00:39.293
LAURA: It's immune to fire.

01:00:39.293 --> 01:00:40.557
LIAM: We don't know that.

01:00:40.557 --> 01:00:42.855
MATT: It seemed to take damage, though lesser,
when you hit it.

01:00:42.855 --> 01:00:46.087
LIAM: <i>Resistant</i> to fire. There's nothing else I
can do from where I am.

01:00:46.087 --> 01:00:47.570
LAURA: Can you catch fire to the bookcase?

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:48.912
LIAM: I don't want to burn the room around us.

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:49.838
MATT: Jester, Molly?

01:00:49.838 --> 01:00:55.094
LAURA: Should I try to heal Yasha, or move the
bookcase? I'm the strong one.

01:00:55.094 --> 01:00:56.431
TALIESIN: Move the bookcase.

01:00:56.431 --> 01:01:01.515
LIAM: If I set it on fire, someone will still have
to pull it anyway. It's not like it's going to disintegrate.

01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:08.422
LAURA: I can use my last spell. I have a 2nd-level
spell. I'm going to, bonus action, use Healing

01:01:08.422 --> 01:01:15.129
Word at 2nd-level on Yasha to bring her back, and
then I'm going to run over and try to crash the

01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:16.117
bookcase down.

01:01:16.117 --> 01:01:22.950
MATT: You go ahead and expend your bonus action.
Roll for that. 2d4 plus your Wisdom modifier.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:26.113
LAURA: Six plus four. Ten!

01:01:26.113 --> 01:01:29.718
MATT: You heal ten hit points. Yasha, you come to
consciousness on the ground. Your weapon is about

01:01:29.718 --> 01:01:33.449
two feet from your grasp. The first thing you do,
your eyes shoot open and then shoot to your

01:01:33.449 --> 01:01:36.742
weapon. Natural instinct to defend yourself. It's
easily within your grasp. You just have to get up

01:01:36.742 --> 01:01:37.748
to grab it.

01:01:37.748 --> 01:01:40.727
LAURA: Can I get all the way over to the
bookcase?

01:01:40.727 --> 01:01:43.926
MATT: (counting) 30. You get right to the
bookcase.

01:01:43.926 --> 01:01:45.296
LAURA: I try to yank it over.

01:01:45.296 --> 01:01:46.381
MATT: Make an athletics check.

01:01:46.381 --> 01:01:48.390
MARISHA: Can I give her some assistance?

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:52.150
MATT: That would be your action to do so; you've
already tried. The DC is going down as you both

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:53.160
are working on it.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:53.751
LAURA: 16.

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:59.226
MATT: As you grab and reach around the side with
Beau, you pull on the bookcase. (creaking) You

01:01:59.226 --> 01:02:03.149
step back quickly as it slams onto the ground.

01:02:03.149 --> 01:02:04.746
LAURA: Is there anything behind it?

01:02:04.746 --> 01:02:08.804
MATT: Right behind it there's a small pocket where
the stone seems to have crumbled a bit. It looks

01:02:08.804 --> 01:02:10.699
like a dark space on the inside.

01:02:10.699 --> 01:02:11.612
SAM: How small?

01:02:11.612 --> 01:02:14.117
MATT: It's about that wide on the wall.

01:02:14.117 --> 01:02:18.164
SAM: What's in there?

01:02:18.164 --> 01:02:21.270
LAURA: I bet its remains are in there! Kill it!

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:23.136
MATT: All right, does that end your turn, Jester?

01:02:23.136 --> 01:02:24.439
LAURA: I don't think I can do anything else.

01:02:24.439 --> 01:02:25.820
MATT: That's all you've got. Molly?

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:31.642
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over to it and start
taking slices at it. I'm going to stab it with my sword.

01:02:31.642 --> 01:02:37.533
MATT: You have darkvision, so as both you and
Jester glance inside, you can see there is a small

01:02:37.811 --> 01:02:45.199
five foot by five foot chamber inside, where there
are a number of pots and small cases. It was a

01:02:45.199 --> 01:02:49.899
small burial chamber of some kind. There in the
center, you see this large urn, about a foot and a

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:56.980
half wide, squat, a dull gray color. You have no
color depth in this darkness, unfortunately, with

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:02.053
your darkvision, but it's this very squat,
well-made vase or urn of some kind.

01:03:02.053 --> 01:03:03.573
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Two shots.

01:03:03.573 --> 01:03:08.735
MATT: You're having to put your arm through and
swing towards it, so disadvantage on each strike.

01:03:08.735 --> 01:03:12.359
TALIESIN: All right. First one is 13 to hit.

01:03:12.359 --> 01:03:19.648
MATT: 13 just barely hits, but it's a hardy urn.
We'll see how much damage you deal.

01:03:19.648 --> 01:03:22.422
TALIESIN: That's eight points of damage.

01:03:22.422 --> 01:03:26.567
MATT: Eight points of damage. You make impact, and
you see a part of it crack from the blow, but it's

01:03:26.567 --> 01:03:28.454
not enough to shatter it.

01:03:28.454 --> 01:03:30.295
TALIESIN: I'm taking another swing.

01:03:30.295 --> 01:03:33.935
MATT: As you pull it out and jam the other arm in
to go for a straight strike with your scimitar.

01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:36.990
TALIESIN: That's 17 to hit.

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:38.833
MATT: 17 hits. Roll damage.

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:40.595
TALIESIN: That's five points of damage.

01:03:40.595 --> 01:03:47.210
MATT: As you reach through, you feel the urn break
beneath the blow. There's this moment of silence

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:55.251
as you hear this (low gasp) dully filter out. The
entity slowly shifts from the ceiling as you watch

01:03:55.251 --> 01:04:00.914
it disintegrate. Not vanishing like it did before,
but slowly dissipating. Its form suddenly goes

01:04:00.914 --> 01:04:07.597
from extremely menacing to almost sad, as you
watch it turn to nothingness.

01:04:07.597 --> 01:04:10.189
LIAM: Poofs out into a doughnut as a Fire Bolt
goes (fwoosh)!

01:04:10.189 --> 01:04:13.567
(laughter)

01:04:13.567 --> 01:04:16.051
MARISHA: Smoke grenade! That's awesome!

01:04:16.051 --> 01:04:17.499
LIAM: I got it!

01:04:21.199 --> 01:04:23.374
MARISHA: Mushroom cloud, that was great.

01:04:23.374 --> 01:04:26.715
TRAVIS: Like Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters 2.

01:04:26.715 --> 01:04:30.815
TALIESIN: Is there any way to get in there?

01:04:30.815 --> 01:04:38.099
MATT: It looks like it's holed up. The small hole
looks like somebody tried to push through, or

01:04:38.379 --> 01:04:44.071
previously emerged and bricked what they could.
You can't fit through the hole, unfortunately.

01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:48.203
TALIESIN: I'm going to start trying to open it up.
I want to go in there, look for things, and break

01:04:48.203 --> 01:04:48.772
every damn--

01:04:48.772 --> 01:04:54.345
LAURA: Wait! We should heal, you guys. Should we
take a short rest and heal up a little bit?

01:04:54.345 --> 01:04:56.708
TRAVIS: We should take a short rest. A breather,
yeah.

01:04:56.708 --> 01:05:03.082
ASHLEY: Jester, thank you for healing me. I feel
like I did not deserve that, but thank you very much.

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:05.929
LAURA: Oh! You're welcome. You deserved it so
much! You did so good!

01:05:05.929 --> 01:05:09.800
SAM: Oh boy, I've already used most of my hit
dice. That's crazy.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.674
MATT: You guys take a short rest of about an hour
or so, as you sit down and recover your breath,

01:05:14.674 --> 01:05:17.260
take a moment to center yourself, tend to your
wounds.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:37.554
SAM: After we've rested for a while, can I walk
over to the little hole and peek in? I can't fit

01:05:37.554 --> 01:05:38.972
through that little hole, can I?

01:05:38.972 --> 01:05:47.079
MATT: You're pretty tiny. Make an acrobatics
check. This is one of the benefits of being

01:05:47.079 --> 01:05:48.267
something so small.

01:05:48.267 --> 01:05:50.029
SAM: All right. Ten.

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:52.257
MATT: Ten? You just manage to pull through. It
wasn't a hard--

01:05:52.257 --> 01:06:01.524
SAM: I'll take off my stuff, give it to Caleb for
safekeeping, and do you have any butter or anything?

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:10.890
LAURA: Let's see. Let me look in my possessions. I
don't think I have any butter.

01:06:11.557 --> 01:06:14.177
SAM: I don't want to get wet.

01:06:14.177 --> 01:06:16.677
MARISHA: I've got a little bit of oil.

01:06:16.677 --> 01:06:18.790
SAM: Oh yeah! Oil! I'll take some oil!

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:26.208
TALIESIN: I use all my hit dice when I heal,
because of Tough, right? There was something I got.

01:06:26.208 --> 01:06:30.332
SAM: Matt, I'm asking Beau to slather me in oil.

01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:35.406
MATT: Grease the goblin action is what you're
taking.

01:06:35.406 --> 01:06:38.594
SAM: Get it in there! Work it in! Mm-hmm!

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:41.392
MATT: No, not for Tough, it gives you additional
hit points. There's another feat that does that.

01:06:41.392 --> 01:06:43.189
TALIESIN: I feel like I got that, though.

01:06:43.189 --> 01:06:45.013
MATT: You got Tough for the additional hit points.

01:06:45.013 --> 01:06:46.852
TALIESIN: Was there something else that does
that?

01:06:46.852 --> 01:06:51.882
MATT: Durable is the one feat that gives you +1
Constitution when you roll hit dice.

01:06:51.882 --> 01:06:56.337
TALIESIN: I feel like there was a thing. I'll have
to keep reading.

01:06:56.337 --> 01:07:02.231
MARISHA: I'll give you a little bit of a
therapeutic temple rub while I'm at it.

01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:05.894
SAM: I'm going to Slip N' Slide my way into the
hole.

01:07:05.894 --> 01:07:14.845
MATT: You take a moment back, and run and dive in!
The greased goblin squeezes through the small gap.

01:07:14.845 --> 01:07:20.007
It scrapes your shoulders and hurts a bit. You
tumble in, which is great, because you land in the

01:07:20.007 --> 01:07:23.071
remains of the ash. You are covered in grease,
which all sticks to you.

01:07:23.071 --> 01:07:25.082
(screaming)

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:27.029
TRAVIS: The worst! It's the worst!

01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:32.843
MATT: You got ashed and feathered? Tarred and--
What do you call it? Oiled and ashed!

01:07:32.843 --> 01:07:36.089
SAM: It's cool guys. It's fun.

01:07:36.089 --> 01:07:38.558
TRAVIS: Suddenly I'm scared of falling on the
beach.

01:07:38.558 --> 01:07:44.958
LIAM: I send in two globules after her to see the
antiqued goblin.

01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:50.105
MATT: It's a small chamber. It's five foot by five
foot. Anyone else is going to be pretty down in

01:07:50.105 --> 01:07:56.161
there, but you fit in fairly comfortably. There's
the shattered urn and a few small pieces of

01:07:56.161 --> 01:08:02.830
pottery with intricate gold scrolling. They're
probably very nice pieces of art or decor.

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:04.602
SAM: I'm going to check for traps.

01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:06.799
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

01:08:06.799 --> 01:08:07.708
SAM: One.

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:09.312
TRAVIS: Natural?

01:08:09.312 --> 01:08:10.513
SAM: Uh-huh!

01:08:10.513 --> 01:08:13.126
MARISHA: What is that? 600? 700?

01:08:13.126 --> 01:08:13.885
ASHLEY: Six.

01:08:13.885 --> 01:08:15.027
MARISHA: Are you counting, Ash?

01:08:15.027 --> 01:08:17.013
ASHLEY: I am, but I might have lost count.

01:08:17.013 --> 01:08:18.875
LIAM: It takes the edge off.

01:08:18.875 --> 01:08:19.958
ASHLEY: Yeah, it does.

01:08:19.958 --> 01:08:23.595
MARISHA: I've never seen so many people happy for
a natural one.

01:08:23.595 --> 01:08:25.590
MATT: As best you can tell, the room seems safe.

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:30.478
SAM: All right. You said there's a few urns that
are fancier than the others?

01:08:30.478 --> 01:08:35.946
MATT: There are two large ones, nowhere near as
big as the central urn that's been shattered, but

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:39.739
there's two in the corner and a few small boxes
off to the side.

01:08:39.739 --> 01:08:41.385
SAM: What's in the urns?

01:08:41.385 --> 01:08:46.071
MATT: You glance over the inside, and they are
empty. They look to be pieces of art that may have

01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:48.291
meant something to the person who previously--

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.108
SAM: Will they fit through the hole?

01:08:50.108 --> 01:08:52.540
MATT: You may have to dig the hole open a little
bit.

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.857
ASHLEY: I can dig it open a little bit.

01:08:54.857 --> 01:08:56.381
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:59.363
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: (slamming)

01:08:59.363 --> 01:09:03.404
MATT: Given a little time, Yasha begins to peel
the stones from the wall around it.

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:07.873
SAM: Those boxes, can I check in those?

01:09:07.873 --> 01:09:10.708
MATT: Yeah, which one? There's one on each side.

01:09:10.708 --> 01:09:12.248
SAM: I'll take the right one.

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:17.111
MATT: Okay, so you take the right one. You lift
the lid, and as you do, you pull it open and

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:21.688
powder emerges into your face. Make a constitution
saving throw.

01:09:21.688 --> 01:09:26.992
SAM: Constitution save? That would be a four.

01:09:26.992 --> 01:09:35.407
MATT: Four? Okay! You take nine points of poison
damage, and you're poisoned for the next hour.

01:09:35.407 --> 01:09:37.444
SAM: Oh god!

01:09:37.444 --> 01:09:42.790
MATT: This cloud enters your lungs and you begin
coughing. It burns the inside of your throat.

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:44.557
LIAM: Hey Nott, how's it going in there?

01:09:44.557 --> 01:09:49.986
SAM: Great! It's fine! I'm going to cast Mage Hand
and open the other one.

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:53.255
MATT: There we go. (laughter)

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:55.501
LIAM: It's a five feet by five?

01:09:55.501 --> 01:09:57.294
MATT: It's five by five.

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.568
LIAM: You're in a tiny-- Why don't you bring that
thing out of there?

01:09:59.568 --> 01:10:03.993
SAM: No! I've got this! I'm fine! I'll find the
treasure! There's nothing else in there?

01:10:03.993 --> 01:10:10.468
MATT: No, there's nothing else. You look down into
the box. There are sets of gold and silver rings

01:10:10.468 --> 01:10:16.355
and jewelry. It looks like whatever jewelry once
may have been dressed upon the individual who was

01:10:16.355 --> 01:10:20.538
interred in that urn that was scattered. This is
where their jewelry was placed.

01:10:20.538 --> 01:10:22.662
SAM: I'm going to take all of those things.

01:10:22.662 --> 01:10:24.878
MARISHA: Bring the art out, too.

01:10:24.878 --> 01:10:29.868
SAM: Sure, as soon as the hole gets bigger. I'll
open the other box with my Mage-y Hand-y!

01:10:29.868 --> 01:10:35.385
MATT: Okay. That box opens up, and there's another
splash of that same poisonous powder, but you're

01:10:35.385 --> 01:10:38.507
off to the side. It only gets anyone who's
immediately in front of the box.

01:10:38.507 --> 01:10:40.127
SAM: I did it, guys!

01:10:40.127 --> 01:10:46.082
LIAM: I feel like Nott's head comes out of the
hole, going (rapid gasping) for fresh air.

01:10:46.082 --> 01:10:47.991
SAM: What's in that box?

01:10:47.991 --> 01:10:56.503
MATT: That box contains a folded raiment of some
kind, like a ceremonial mantle made of dark black

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:59.998
and gray cloth with red embroidered designs on it.

01:10:59.998 --> 01:11:03.088
SAM: Do I recognize any symbols or anything?

01:11:03.088 --> 01:11:05.118
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:11:05.118 --> 01:11:07.973
SAM: Natural one.

01:11:07.973 --> 01:11:10.776
TRAVIS: Yay! That's seven!

01:11:10.776 --> 01:11:13.193
MATT: You are knocking it out of the park for
charity!

01:11:13.193 --> 01:11:17.371
MARISHA: They're like, "We didn't anticipate
this."

01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:27.349
SAM: Everyone, I found a piece of clothing, an
article of (hacking cough) clothing! Here, I'll

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:29.195
pass it out to you.

01:11:29.195 --> 01:11:30.462
LAURA: Is it pretty?

01:11:30.462 --> 01:11:35.452
SAM: It's very pretty. Some art pieces. Some
<i>objets d'art</i>!

01:11:35.452 --> 01:11:37.349
MARISHA: Rich people love fancy art.

01:11:37.349 --> 01:11:41.774
LAURA: Can I look at the art? Do I know the
artists?

01:11:41.774 --> 01:11:47.686
MATT: From the giant boxes, you mean?

01:11:47.686 --> 01:11:49.714
LAURA: I don't know what's going on.

01:11:49.714 --> 01:11:53.316
MATT: The art are two large, well-made vases, that
you eventually pull through the space here.

01:11:53.316 --> 01:11:54.718
LAURA: Well, that's not as cool.

01:11:54.718 --> 01:11:57.108
MATT: You don't recognize it. These were made a
long time ago.

01:11:57.108 --> 01:11:59.037
LAURA: Ooh, they're antique.

01:11:59.037 --> 01:12:00.839
ASHLEY: Could be worth a pretty penny.

01:12:00.839 --> 01:12:01.229
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:02.885
TRAVIS: What about that cloak?

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:04.486
LAURA: I put them in the bag. How about that?

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:07.314
MATT: Okay. You have the folded mantle.

01:12:07.314 --> 01:12:09.023
TALIESIN: What does the mantle look like?

01:12:09.023 --> 01:12:17.690
MATT: The mantle is a dark black, a front chest
mantle area, with gray stripes coming along the

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:21.630
sides and this red embroidered design that emerges
from around the neck, all across the front and

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:22.792
back of the mantle.

01:12:22.792 --> 01:12:24.051
TALIESIN: Does it look familiar?

01:12:24.051 --> 01:12:24.516
MATT: No.

01:12:24.516 --> 01:12:27.801
TALIESIN: I was hoping.

01:12:27.801 --> 01:12:32.795
TRAVIS: Can I come up and see if it has any magic
feel to it?

01:12:32.795 --> 01:12:39.128
MATT: I mean, you can make an arcana check to see
if you recognize any elements of it.

01:12:39.128 --> 01:12:43.380
LIAM: I am stowing away the journal in there.

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:44.075
TRAVIS: 17.

01:12:44.075 --> 01:12:54.680
MATT: You get a closer look, and you can see parts
of the edges are burned. The very bottom parts of

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:59.417
it seem to have been committed to some sort of
flame. The edges of it are singed a bit. The black

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:05.300
collar causes it to be lost at a distant view, but
close up, you can see where it's been damaged.

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:09.487
There's a fold at the front of it, a small pocket
right there.

01:13:09.487 --> 01:13:14.760
TRAVIS: Weird. Looks like it's been burned a bit.
It's got a little compartment in the front.

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.075
LIAM: Like a kangaroo pouch?

01:13:17.075 --> 01:13:18.146
TRAVIS: I don't know.

01:13:18.146 --> 01:13:22.142
MATT: Kind of, it's on the side. Because a mantle
would go down to about there for someone wearing

01:13:22.142 --> 01:13:26.346
it. you put your hand in there, and it's a heavy
material.

01:13:26.346 --> 01:13:28.257
TRAVIS: You want to try it on?

01:13:28.257 --> 01:13:32.861
LIAM: I would prefer to inspect it. Are we going
to stay here for a little while?

01:13:32.861 --> 01:13:38.172
MARISHA: While all of this is going on, Beau wants
to be going through some of these books that were

01:13:38.172 --> 01:13:39.970
on the shelf that we knocked over.

01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:41.587
MATT: The shelf is mostly empty.

01:13:41.587 --> 01:13:44.082
TRAVIS: There was that one book on the desk.

01:13:44.082 --> 01:13:47.570
LIAM: We could sit down on the floor together and
have a look.

01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:50.791
TALIESIN: What else did you get out of there?

01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:54.532
MATT: You have the urns in the cages. You have the
tables over there. You have the two braziers

01:13:54.532 --> 01:14:00.393
filled with ash on the sides. You have the broken
cages back there. Everything that you see there is

01:14:00.393 --> 01:14:01.991
what's in the chamber.

01:14:04.281 --> 01:14:09.147
MARISHA: I'm going to do a tour of the urns and
see if there's anything, jewelry or something,

01:14:09.147 --> 01:14:10.447
hidden in there.

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:12.470
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:16.043
LIAM: Also, what I would recommend, if we feel
comfortable sitting down for a moment, is to put

01:14:16.043 --> 01:14:21.054
all of our findings in the middle of the room, and
I can ritually see which of these things are

01:14:21.054 --> 01:14:25.557
magic. Most of these things, we suspect, but maybe
there are some other things. Then I can tell what

01:14:25.557 --> 01:14:27.591
exactly they are. I need some time.

01:14:27.591 --> 01:14:29.644
TALIESIN: That is a good idea.

01:14:29.644 --> 01:14:35.045
LIAM: Also, before Nott even got out, I'm stowing
the journal away for a closer read.

01:14:35.045 --> 01:14:36.371
MATT: Okay. Totally fine.

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:36.897
MARISHA: 21.

01:14:36.897 --> 01:14:43.254
MATT: 21, okay! You go through from cage to cage.
The urns are scattered ash. Nothing catches your

01:14:43.254 --> 01:14:48.400
eye from those two. The nooses you pull through
and tug on, and the rope rots and breaks in your

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.957
grasp. You go past the brazier on that side with
the ashes, and you poke around with your staff,

01:14:52.957 --> 01:14:58.685
and something catches your staff underneath the
ash. You prod in there, and as you push it aside,

01:14:58.685 --> 01:15:04.464
there's an object in the ash that is partially
burned. As you pull it free and dust it off, it's

01:15:04.464 --> 01:15:10.064
another book. A large portion of the back of it is
burned off, and most of the pages are destroyed on

01:15:10.064 --> 01:15:15.822
the back end, but a good half of the book is
mostly still intact. Like when it got thrown in

01:15:15.822 --> 01:15:20.407
there to be destroyed, the flame wasn't quite
strong enough to consume the entire book.

01:15:20.407 --> 01:15:22.486
MARISHA: Can I do a little flip through of it?

01:15:22.486 --> 01:15:28.582
MATT: Yeah. As you go through, it's filled with
strange script and scrolling. Make an arcana check.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.993
MARISHA: Can I use a ki point to get advantage?

01:15:31.993 --> 01:15:32.723
MATT: You can.

01:15:32.723 --> 01:15:42.443
MARISHA: I'll mark that down really quick. I'll
take that 11 over that two. 13?

01:15:42.443 --> 01:15:48.488
MATT: 13. You don't understand the nature of any
of this, but it seems magical in nature. The

01:15:48.488 --> 01:15:52.817
script and elements of design remind you of the
things you saw on the ceiling in the previous

01:15:52.817 --> 01:15:56.884
room. Though not exact, there are similarities to
the way the script is drawn.

01:15:56.884 --> 01:15:59.046
TRAVIS: This is one of the ones in the cages,
right?

01:15:59.046 --> 01:16:01.639
MATT: It was in the brazier, right there in the
center.

01:16:01.639 --> 01:16:03.260
MARISHA: They tried to burn it.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:07.288
TRAVIS: Hey Yasha, you feel like knocking the shit
out of some of those cages, opening them up?

01:16:07.288 --> 01:16:09.403
ASHLEY: I walk over and just start hitting.

01:16:09.403 --> 01:16:15.333
MATT: You start bashing and shaking it. You bend
and eventually tear through some of the cage and

01:16:15.645 --> 01:16:22.413
glance through. You guys, together, begin to
inspect the other cages, and honestly, in there,

01:16:22.413 --> 01:16:27.269
what you find is ash. Most everything in this
chamber has been destroyed. Intentionally, it

01:16:27.269 --> 01:16:32.736
seems. Either by the previous denizen, who lived
here, that you destroyed, or somebody else that

01:16:32.736 --> 01:16:37.048
had been here in here before. The only things that
you find are what was in that burial chamber in

01:16:37.048 --> 01:16:40.878
the back, and that mostly burned tome in your
hand.

01:16:40.878 --> 01:16:44.835
MARISHA: I walk over to Caleb. Hey Caleb. Found
this.

01:16:44.835 --> 01:16:47.656
LIAM: Oh. Would you like to add it to the pile?

01:16:47.656 --> 01:16:51.851
MARISHA: Sure. I think it's got stuff for you in
it.

01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:56.503
LIAM: I'm not really into smut. That's a bit of a
ruse.

01:16:56.503 --> 01:17:00.970
MARISHA: That's unfortunate, actually.

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:02.523
LIAM: I mean, more than normal.

01:17:02.523 --> 01:17:03.201
MARISHA: Sure.

01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:04.323
LIAM: Within reason.

01:17:04.323 --> 01:17:08.313
TRAVIS: Can I walk to the entrance to the tunnel,
just to keep an eye out, while he does his thing?

01:17:08.313 --> 01:17:10.372
MATT: Sure. Make a perception check.

01:17:10.372 --> 01:17:15.367
TALIESIN: Everything's in the pile? Including the
stuff in the second chest?

01:17:15.367 --> 01:17:15.998
TRAVIS: 13.

01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:23.173
SAM: What stuff in the second chest? Huh? What?
Who? Huh?

01:17:23.173 --> 01:17:25.326
TALIESIN: The stuff in the second chest.

01:17:25.326 --> 01:17:27.327
LIAM: Well, she was in a dark hole.

01:17:27.327 --> 01:17:29.350
TALIESIN: I heard two traps go off.

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:39.959
SAM: Of course, I was just about to get it out
here. It's for the whole group. We're a team now. Right?

01:17:39.959 --> 01:17:41.639
TRAVIS: That's very considerate of you, Nott.

01:17:41.639 --> 01:17:44.752
TALIESIN: Anything you take on your own time is
yours. We're on the clock.

01:17:44.752 --> 01:17:50.077
SAM: Of course! I would <i>never</i> try to steal from
the group. I just--

01:17:50.077 --> 01:17:51.294
LAURA: What is it?

01:17:51.294 --> 01:17:53.067
SAM: It's a bunch of gold and jewels.

01:17:53.067 --> 01:17:55.932
LIAM: Hey, you know, this is going to take a
while, so why don't we put it all down, and I will

01:17:55.932 --> 01:17:57.049
get to work, okay?

01:17:57.049 --> 01:17:58.620
SAM: <i>I'm poisoned.</i>

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.179
(laughter)

01:18:02.179 --> 01:18:05.371
LIAM: How much you care to drink is on you.

01:18:05.371 --> 01:18:07.612
LAURA: I've got an herbalism kit.

01:18:07.612 --> 01:18:12.419
MATT: There's like a purple froth at the corner of
her mouth. It's spitting out--

01:18:12.419 --> 01:18:14.373
LIAM: She's antiqued too. She's covered in ash.

01:18:14.373 --> 01:18:15.926
MARISHA: Covered in oil and ash.

01:18:15.926 --> 01:18:18.738
LAURA: Can I use my herbalism kit to get rid of
the poison?

01:18:18.738 --> 01:18:20.913
MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check.

01:18:20.913 --> 01:18:24.527
LIAM: (spitting) Pah. Pah!

01:18:24.527 --> 01:18:29.305
TALIESIN: We're not stealthy, doing this.

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:30.309
LAURA: That's 21.

01:18:30.309 --> 01:18:35.060
MATT: Okay. I'll say yes. You reduce the duration
of the poison from an hour to about ten minutes.

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:41.640
In the time it takes for guys to finish up, most
of the poison eventually begins to wear off. You

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.582
still look at bit worse for wear.

01:18:43.582 --> 01:18:45.133
TALIESIN: Greener than normal.

01:18:45.133 --> 01:18:48.601
SAM: How much money did we get?

01:18:48.601 --> 01:18:54.500
MATT: No coins. It's just jewelry.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.334
LAURA: Are there any rings?

01:18:56.671 --> 01:18:58.618
MATT: Yeah. There's probably a good 12 or so rings
in there.

01:18:58.618 --> 01:19:00.792
LAURA: Caleb! You should see if the rings are
magic.

01:19:00.792 --> 01:19:05.747
LIAM: I am well on my way. I hope I have been
doing this for a while. So step one is Detect

01:19:05.747 --> 01:19:08.041
Magic on the pile to see what's what.

01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:09.980
MATT: Detect Magic on the pile.

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:15.225
LAURA: It also includes the sword and the vases.

01:19:15.225 --> 01:19:22.533
MATT: Correct. The only magical essence you get
from that pile is the large sword that was taken

01:19:22.533 --> 01:19:31.378
off the wall. It's not a magical aura from the
book you just pulled from there, but even your

01:19:31.378 --> 01:19:36.367
quick glance at the way that it's bound, and the
construct of it, is familiar to you.

01:19:36.367 --> 01:19:41.102
LIAM: Does it also help that I'm also within the--
Oh, no, we took a short rest, which is an hour--

01:19:41.102 --> 01:19:46.725
Okay. Good. The sword is the one thing?

01:19:46.725 --> 01:19:49.105
MATT: The sword is the one thing that's giving off
a magical aura.

01:19:49.105 --> 01:19:54.556
LIAM: Okay. Can I pick up this new book and leaf
through it, and try to see--

01:19:54.556 --> 01:20:00.197
MATT: It is a partially damaged, but in some ways
intact, spell book.

01:20:00.197 --> 01:20:06.245
LAURA: Can I try doing the Mending cantrip on it?
Would that help?

01:20:06.245 --> 01:20:09.596
LIAM: Would you be ever so kind? I would be very
grateful.

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:11.248
LAURA: (singing) Le le le le le!

01:20:11.248 --> 01:20:16.621
MATT: Holding your symbol and concentrating on it,
and whispering beneath your breath with a big

01:20:16.621 --> 01:20:23.971
smile, the pages begin to shift out and form into
a full book. The half section that's burned is

01:20:23.971 --> 01:20:25.372
restored to its previous.

01:20:25.372 --> 01:20:28.986
(exclamations of surprise)

01:20:28.986 --> 01:20:32.625
MATT: However, the script isn't there. It doesn't
restore any of the writing on the inside of the

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:33.297
book, unfortunately.

01:20:33.297 --> 01:20:34.708
LAURA: That's still cool.

01:20:34.708 --> 01:20:39.099
MATT: Where you get to the pages where it was
burned, the ink ends at that edge.

01:20:39.099 --> 01:20:42.908
LIAM: I put my hand on top of yours. Thank you
very much.

01:20:42.908 --> 01:20:46.332
MARISHA: You've got like, a section to take notes
now.

01:20:46.332 --> 01:20:47.989
LAURA: Hey, that's good!

01:20:47.989 --> 01:20:50.188
TALIESIN: Or fill in the blanks.

01:20:50.719 --> 01:20:54.972
LIAM: I begin the process of casting Identify on
the sword. Oh, and the mantle. What about the

01:20:54.972 --> 01:20:56.107
mantle? Was that in the pile?

01:20:56.107 --> 01:20:58.964
MATT: The mantle is not magical. It looks like it
was an ornamental--

01:21:01.474 --> 01:21:02.808
SAM: Burial shroud?

01:21:02.808 --> 01:21:08.025
MATT: More like a ceremonial shroud. On the inside
of the pocket, there is a lot of dried blood on

01:21:08.025 --> 01:21:13.828
the inside of it. It looks like something was kept
in there that, at one point, was very viscous and

01:21:13.828 --> 01:21:15.668
covered in crimson.

01:21:15.668 --> 01:21:16.722
MARISHA: Necromancers.

01:21:16.722 --> 01:21:18.000
LIAM: The original goth.

01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:26.806
MATT: Of the book that you find; these are the
remnants of the interior of it, and this is the

01:21:26.806 --> 01:21:28.536
sword identified for you.

01:21:28.536 --> 01:21:37.833
LIAM: Okay, this sword, because I know you're all
dying to know, is very old. It is a greatsword.

01:21:37.833 --> 01:21:40.574
Would I know the name of it by casting this?

01:21:40.574 --> 01:21:42.398
MATT: As part of the Identify spell you would know
what it's called.

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:44.996
LIAM: This sword is called The Magician's Judge.

01:21:44.996 --> 01:21:46.396
LAURA: Whoa.

01:21:46.396 --> 01:21:48.740
LIAM: Excuse me. (heavy accent) The Magicians
<i>Chudge</i>.

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.881
SAM: That's his Zemnian accent.

01:21:55.461 --> 01:21:56.767
LAURA: What else does it--

01:21:56.767 --> 01:21:59.725
LIAM: Oh no, I'm absorbing, and I will tell you in
a moment. I need to make sense of it first.

01:21:59.725 --> 01:22:02.170
LAURA: It's a two-handed then because it's a
great--

01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:04.341
LIAM: It's a great sword, and what this--

01:22:04.341 --> 01:22:05.395
TRAVIS: Not a good sword--

01:22:05.395 --> 01:22:06.687
MARISHA: But a <i>great</i> sword.

01:22:06.687 --> 01:22:13.490
LIAM: (as Jester) "It's pretty great." When
someone like Yasha hits a baddie with this, you

01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:23.065
can dispel any magical property that is present.
Yeah? Or without attacking, you can hold the sword

01:22:23.065 --> 01:22:24.700
up and do the same.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.854
TRAVIS: Oh shit. If they're casting something, it
breaks it?

01:22:27.854 --> 01:22:33.046
MATT: It's not a Counterspell. It's a Dispel
Magic. You still have to roll to see if it

01:22:33.046 --> 01:22:34.546
happens, but essentially you--

01:22:34.546 --> 01:22:36.603
TRAVIS: If they had, like, a Hold Person up it
could dispel it?

01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:39.995
LAURA: We could use it on not-people as well?
Maybe on objects?

01:22:39.995 --> 01:22:41.364
SAM: Magical traps.

01:22:41.364 --> 01:22:44.963
MATT: Anything within the realm of Dispel Magic.
The spell itself.

01:22:44.963 --> 01:22:49.617
LIAM: Big woman. This has your name all over it. I
think--

01:22:49.617 --> 01:22:52.172
ASHLEY: Let me try and see if--

01:22:52.172 --> 01:22:54.168
LIAM: Yeah, you'll have to pick it up. I can't
even lift this thing.

01:22:54.168 --> 01:22:54.861
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:22:56.501 --> 01:22:59.233
LAURA: (laughter) That's how you hold a
greatsword?

01:22:59.233 --> 01:23:00.320
ASHLEY: Whoa!

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:05.355
MATT: The hilt curves at the tip and comes up at
an angle like this. Like a very subtle "V" shape.

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:11.037
With the scrolling and runes on the edge. The
blade itself is this wide, thick, gradually coming

01:23:11.037 --> 01:23:16.161
to a point, greatsword, about five feet long from
hilt to edge of blade. It's practically an anime

01:23:16.161 --> 01:23:21.987
sword. Looking at it, and based on what he
discovered of the sword itself, it was used in the

01:23:21.987 --> 01:23:29.118
Age of Arcanum as an executioner's blade, to kill
mages that were caught by the law and went against

01:23:29.118 --> 01:23:34.825
the law of the land. It was used, and probably had
been used, to execute a number of mages in the past.

01:23:34.825 --> 01:23:38.001
LAURA: Oh, it's dark. Is it cursed? Does it feel
cursed?

01:23:40.731 --> 01:23:41.573
ASHLEY: Hello?

01:23:41.573 --> 01:23:45.682
TRAVIS: (laughter)

01:23:47.472 --> 01:23:48.784
ASHLEY: I don't think so.

01:23:48.784 --> 01:23:54.108
MATT: Caleb, as you're recalling the information
from the Identify sword, you recall the notes that

01:23:54.575 --> 01:23:58.144
you picked from the book, when you entered the
chamber, that spoke of a bounty hunter that had

01:23:58.144 --> 01:24:00.705
come for Siff. The trophy that was taken.

01:24:00.705 --> 01:24:02.508
MARISHA: Took his legs, yeah.

01:24:02.508 --> 01:24:03.689
SAM: With the sword?

01:24:03.689 --> 01:24:05.446
MARISHA: That's why he had no feetsies.

01:24:05.446 --> 01:24:07.697
LAURA: So Siff <i>didn't</i> have any feet!

01:24:07.697 --> 01:24:09.670
MARISHA: He actually didn't have feet. He lost his
legs.

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:11.467
TALIESIN: He did have feet. They were just
somewhere else.

01:24:11.467 --> 01:24:17.720
MATT: You get the sense the sword that was in the
wall was the trophy taken from that bounty hunter.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.997
LIAM: Yeah. I assumed that immediately before the
thing attacked. Probably Siff's legs are all over

01:24:20.997 --> 01:24:21.934
you right now.

01:24:21.934 --> 01:24:24.536
SAM: Oh. No. Ugh. Gross.

01:24:24.536 --> 01:24:28.986
LAURA: Do you think taking the sword off the wall
was what made Siff be able to come back?

01:24:28.986 --> 01:24:31.093
LIAM: I don't know, but it was worth it.

01:24:31.093 --> 01:24:31.604
LAURA: Hmm.

01:24:31.604 --> 01:24:34.634
MARISHA: Hmm. I don't know.

01:24:34.634 --> 01:24:36.914
LAURA: At least we're not dead, you guys!

01:24:36.914 --> 01:24:38.038
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah!

01:24:38.038 --> 01:24:39.769
SAM: We have some rings.

01:24:39.769 --> 01:24:43.683
LAURA: Oh! We can put them on now! They're not
magic.

01:24:43.683 --> 01:24:49.259
SAM: Well, I know we share everything, but I feel
like the ladies of the group would enjoy them

01:24:49.259 --> 01:24:54.283
more. Maybe we just take them? The ladies of the
group?

01:24:54.283 --> 01:24:55.746
TRAVIS: I don't mind.

01:24:55.746 --> 01:24:59.739
TALIESIN: I'm taking a ring. How many are there?

01:24:59.739 --> 01:25:01.295
MATT: 12 rings.

01:25:01.295 --> 01:25:03.989
LIAM: Caleb is chewing on his finger and looking
through the book.

01:25:03.989 --> 01:25:08.487
SAM: We all get one. I should get one for finding
them.

01:25:08.487 --> 01:25:09.532
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:25:09.532 --> 01:25:12.321
SAM: I should get one for sharing them. That was a
good deed.

01:25:12.321 --> 01:25:15.068
TALIESIN: That was not a good deed. That is
literally baseline of what's expected.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:18.478
LAURA: I should get an extra one for healing you
for poison, so that's two for me.

01:25:18.478 --> 01:25:21.350
SAM: Fjord gave up his. I'll take his share.
That's four for me.

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:24.959
LAURA: I get Caleb's because he's not saying
anything. That's three for me.

01:25:24.959 --> 01:25:28.302
SAM: Beau, you're naturally beautiful, so I'll
take yours--

01:25:28.302 --> 01:25:30.291
MARISHA: Give me a damn ring.

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.381
SAM: Damn it.

01:25:31.381 --> 01:25:33.332
LAURA: How many is that? Seven, eight?

01:25:33.332 --> 01:25:37.733
TALIESIN: I'm taking an extra one for helping you
remember that you're supposed to share.

01:25:37.733 --> 01:25:40.631
LAURA: Yasha, that's two rings left for you.

01:25:40.631 --> 01:25:45.592
TALIESIN: You can put it in your ear.

01:25:45.592 --> 01:25:47.672
LAURA: Or in your nose!

01:25:47.672 --> 01:25:53.011
SAM: Oh, I have a nose ring! I'm going to swap one
out! Don't look!

01:25:53.011 --> 01:25:56.046
LAURA: There has to be a hole in it for you
to be able to do that.

01:25:56.046 --> 01:25:59.553
SAM: Oh, fuck! I got snot and ash all over it.

01:25:59.553 --> 01:26:02.203
MATT: Yeah, you are a mess right now.

01:26:02.203 --> 01:26:08.318
MARISHA: Beau leans over Caleb's shoulder. What
are you reading?

01:26:08.776 --> 01:26:13.202
LIAM: I'm thinking of all the good things that I
can do for our new collective.

01:26:13.202 --> 01:26:18.147
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cool. Who's the publisher?
Is that first print? First edition?

01:26:18.147 --> 01:26:28.089
LIAM: It is the Random Old House. First edition.
Let me tell you, this was a good find, everyone!

01:26:28.089 --> 01:26:32.726
MARISHA: I recognize a few of those symbols.

01:26:32.726 --> 01:26:34.600
LIAM: Yeah? What do they mean?

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.608
MARISHA: You know, magic shit.

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:38.294
LIAM: You are correct.

01:26:38.294 --> 01:26:42.450
TRAVIS: He's redacting his own card!

01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:44.750
LAURA: What is he writing?

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:50.874
SAM: Oh, by the way, sidenote everyone, out of
game, Laura has been taking our inventory and

01:26:50.874 --> 01:26:53.943
keeping it. Lost the page with all of the--

01:26:53.943 --> 01:26:56.690
LAURA: No! I didn't lose the page. I lost the
whole spiral!

01:26:56.690 --> 01:26:59.554
SAM: We have no idea what we have as a party
anymore.

01:26:59.554 --> 01:27:03.712
TRAVIS: The idiot goliath kept it for five years.

01:27:03.712 --> 01:27:07.488
LAURA: Yes, well, things moved for some reason.

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:08.802
LIAM: Terrible roleplay.

01:27:08.802 --> 01:27:10.813
TRAVIS: Are you sure it's not on the table?

01:27:10.813 --> 01:27:12.901
LAURA: Does anybody see a little--

01:27:12.901 --> 01:27:15.202
SAM: You're looking for it now?

01:27:15.202 --> 01:27:17.198
LAURA: Yeah, because I need it!

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:21.706
MATT: While she's looking for that, what are you
guys doing?

01:27:21.706 --> 01:27:23.790
TRAVIS: Anything else in the hallway moving?

01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:25.588
MATT: You don't see anything else moving, no.

01:27:25.588 --> 01:27:30.464
MARISHA: The Gentleman just wanted us to kill
shit, right?

01:27:30.464 --> 01:27:32.124
TRAVIS: Yeah, just to clear it out.

01:27:32.124 --> 01:27:33.729
MARISHA: He wanted us to-- Did you find it?

01:27:33.729 --> 01:27:34.708
MATT: She found it.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:42.309
MARISHA: Did he want us to bring back something?
Or just clear it out?

01:27:42.309 --> 01:27:45.164
SAM: There was something.

01:27:45.164 --> 01:27:46.619
MATT: He said clear it out--

01:27:46.619 --> 01:27:48.253
LAURA: Get evidence of something.

01:27:48.253 --> 01:27:50.496
SAM: Evidence of magic?

01:27:50.496 --> 01:27:58.198
MATT: Pretty much find out the nature of the
place, clear it out, bring back what you find, and

01:27:58.198 --> 01:28:00.291
he may let you keep some of the spoils.

01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:02.812
LAURA: He <i>may</i> let us keep some of the spoils?

01:28:02.812 --> 01:28:09.799
MARISHA: I thought he said he wanted us to bring
the expensive good shit, but we can keep whatever else.

01:28:09.799 --> 01:28:11.188
MATT: Essentially.

01:28:11.188 --> 01:28:13.841
LIAM: You know, we could give him some of those
rings.

01:28:13.841 --> 01:28:15.841
MARISHA: Maybe some of the art?

01:28:16.477 --> 01:28:17.850
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, definitely the art.

01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:19.422
SAM: The art, yeah. The vases.

01:28:19.422 --> 01:28:25.218
LAURA: I bet they're worth a lot of money, though.
Rich people love old things.

01:28:25.218 --> 01:28:31.104
MARISHA: They love old things! If we say it
belonged to a dead person, they love it even more.

01:28:31.104 --> 01:28:36.013
TRAVIS: Plus, if you give them all the rings, they
might give us a job with more fancy stuff next time.

01:28:36.013 --> 01:28:38.499
SAM: Is it just rings, Matt, or were there other
things in there?

01:28:38.499 --> 01:28:43.771
MATT: There were rings, a couple of loose
bracelets. It was basically a collection of

01:28:43.771 --> 01:28:45.183
ornamental jewelry.

01:28:45.183 --> 01:28:47.834
LIAM: If we skimp, he's going to think we're
bigger assholes than we actually are.

01:28:47.834 --> 01:28:51.668
TALIESIN: Let's keep it all together then, for
now. Except for the books.

01:28:51.668 --> 01:28:53.340
MARISHA: We'll each take a ring.

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:54.044
LAURA: One ring.

01:28:54.044 --> 01:28:55.879
MARISHA: We'll each take one ring.

01:28:55.879 --> 01:28:57.815
LAURA: Mine rules them all, though.

01:28:57.815 --> 01:29:00.528
TALIESIN: Got to do business.

01:29:00.528 --> 01:29:02.561
LIAM: You take my ring.

01:29:02.561 --> 01:29:05.347
SAM: No, you don't have to-- All right.

01:29:05.347 --> 01:29:13.709
LAURA: I already took his ring, so technically--
Here.

01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:17.930
SAM: You can have Fjord's ring. Fjord doesn't want
one, right?

01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:18.980
LIAM: Give her a ring.

01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:21.386
LAURA: (singing) I have two rings now still.

01:29:21.386 --> 01:29:30.911
MARISHA: Maybe we can give him that research
notebook we found. You keep the spellbook, we give

01:29:30.911 --> 01:29:33.501
him the research notebook. We already know what
was in it.

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:36.604
LIAM: I gave it a cursory glance. I skimmed it.

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:39.869
SAM: Well, if you read it on the way back, you'll
remember it forever.

01:29:39.869 --> 01:29:40.897
LIAM: That's a good point.

01:29:40.897 --> 01:29:42.636
LAURA: What about the sword?

01:29:42.636 --> 01:29:44.481
MARISHA: I say we keep the sword.

01:29:44.481 --> 01:29:48.208
LIAM: No, we keep that sword. This one with that
sword?

01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:53.936
ASHLEY: I like it. You know, we can-- I don't
know.

01:29:53.936 --> 01:29:56.741
LAURA: I mean, he probably can't even hold a
greatsword.

01:29:56.741 --> 01:30:00.031
TRAVIS: It's pretty obvious you're going to have
to hide it if we walk back in there.

01:30:00.031 --> 01:30:02.600
LIAM: We can put it in the Haversack, can't we?

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.033
ASHLEY: Do you see it?

01:30:04.033 --> 01:30:05.725
LAURA: It's a little big for the Haversack.

01:30:05.725 --> 01:30:10.263
LIAM: I thought that thing was Mary Poppins'
satchel. It doesn't go all funny?

01:30:10.263 --> 01:30:13.352
LAURA: Not quite so much. It's only eight cubic
feet.

01:30:13.352 --> 01:30:22.723
LIAM: While we talk to The Gentleman, while we
navigate that, I could carry the thingy to make

01:30:22.723 --> 01:30:25.290
room for it.

01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:26.957
ASHLEY: Do we all have to go inside to talk to
him?

01:30:26.957 --> 01:30:28.002
TRAVIS: No, I don't think we do.

01:30:28.002 --> 01:30:29.541
MARISHA: Do we have to go back out through the
river to get out of here?

01:30:29.541 --> 01:30:32.190
TRAVIS: Yeah. We didn't see any other exits,
right?

01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:36.426
MATT: No, the only way out that you know of is the
same way you came in.

01:30:36.426 --> 01:30:38.919
TRAVIS: Which is weird because it was all caved
in.

01:30:38.919 --> 01:30:46.817
MARISHA: Which means we're going to have to pass
right back through The Gentleman's place. It's not

01:30:47.170 --> 01:30:50.041
like we're going to be able to lie.

01:30:50.041 --> 01:30:54.062
TRAVIS: Can you mend the transportation circle?

01:30:54.062 --> 01:30:58.594
LAURA: I don't think it works quite like that. It
has to be a broken thing.

01:30:58.594 --> 01:31:03.064
LIAM: Yes, and this sort of thing takes a lot of
work from very specialized people.

01:31:03.064 --> 01:31:04.635
MARISHA: I wonder where it goes.

01:31:04.635 --> 01:31:12.035
SAM: You could mend the big urn that held the
ashes of the lich-y thing. Then we can take that

01:31:12.035 --> 01:31:13.569
urn back and give it to--

01:31:13.569 --> 01:31:15.558
LAURA: As long as there were no ashes in it.

01:31:15.558 --> 01:31:17.325
SAM: They're all on me.

01:31:17.325 --> 01:31:23.893
MATT: I will say, unfortunately, the urn that was
destroyed that contained Siff's remains is a bit

01:31:23.893 --> 01:31:29.906
large for the Mend spell. You can only mend a
foot-by-foot space. The urn was a big old thing.

01:31:29.906 --> 01:31:35.193
LIAM: Clarification: When Caleb did Detect Magic,
did the circle in the center of the room glow at

01:31:35.193 --> 01:31:36.786
all? Or is it-- It's dead.

01:31:36.786 --> 01:31:42.359
MATT: Nope. You see it's been scarred
intentionally from the inside. Possibly, whatever

01:31:42.359 --> 01:31:48.688
flurry of intent that Siff had to burn the book,
destroy everything, burn everything from the

01:31:48.688 --> 01:31:54.433
inside also, was to destroy the circle and allow
nothing else to come through. You get the sense

01:31:54.433 --> 01:31:57.048
that the final moments in this chamber were
probably very paranoid.

01:31:57.048 --> 01:32:01.254
MARISHA: What do we remember about the Crawling
King? Do you know anything?

01:32:01.254 --> 01:32:03.063
MATT: That would be a religion check.

01:32:03.063 --> 01:32:04.722
LIAM: I will make a religion check.

01:32:04.722 --> 01:32:06.833
TRAVIS: I will make one too, but I'm not going to
count it.

01:32:06.833 --> 01:32:08.695
TALIESIN: Advantage, or no?

01:32:08.695 --> 01:32:10.132
MATT: For you? No.

01:32:10.132 --> 01:32:11.295
LIAM: 15 for Caleb.

01:32:11.295 --> 01:32:12.659
TALIESIN: No. That's a one.

01:32:12.659 --> 01:32:20.640
LAURA: Oh, it wasn't an herbalism kit. I'm stupid.
It wasn't an herbalism kit that could heal the

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:25.131
poison. It was medicinal herbs. That's what I had
in my inventory that I remembered.

01:32:25.131 --> 01:32:33.325
MATT: Oh. You rolled pretty well, same difference.
We'll say it would have lasted a little longer,

01:32:33.325 --> 01:32:40.232
but you still managed to outlast the poison. There
was no threat at that moment. What'd you roll?

01:32:40.232 --> 01:32:40.989
LIAM: 15.

01:32:40.989 --> 01:32:43.546
MATT: 15 religion? Anybody else? No?

01:32:43.546 --> 01:32:45.117
TRAVIS: I rolled it, but--

01:32:45.117 --> 01:32:46.321
MATT: What did you roll?

01:32:46.321 --> 01:32:47.056
TRAVIS: A 20.

01:32:47.056 --> 01:32:48.185
MARISHA: Did you say you rolled a one?

01:32:48.185 --> 01:32:48.946
TALIESIN: A one.

01:32:48.946 --> 01:32:50.854
MARISHA: You rolled a one, another one!

01:32:50.854 --> 01:32:59.987
MATT: There you go. The Crawling King is known
as-- What you can recall with a 20, strangely, and

01:32:59.987 --> 01:33:04.681
the information comes to you esoterically. You're
not entirely certain where the inspiration for

01:33:04.681 --> 01:33:10.083
this knowledge comes from, but you have these
images of one of the betrayer gods in history.

01:33:10.083 --> 01:33:19.541
You've heard stories or something that inspires
you to remember something inhuman and larva-like:

01:33:19.817 --> 01:33:29.703
a monstrous, terrible worm crawling through the
deepest tunnels of the world. Now locked away,

01:33:29.703 --> 01:33:33.509
Post-Calamity, with all the rest of the betrayer
gods.

01:33:33.509 --> 01:33:35.559
LIAM: Why do you have such a queer look on your
face?

01:33:35.559 --> 01:33:41.132
TRAVIS: I feel like I remember something about a
real larva-looking worm. Huge fucking thing.

01:33:41.132 --> 01:33:44.446
MATT and TRAVIS: Screaming human face at the
front.

01:33:44.446 --> 01:33:46.758
LIAM: For the Crawling King, you are talking
about?

01:33:46.758 --> 01:33:49.792
LAURA: I definitely start drawing that in my
notebook.

01:33:49.792 --> 01:33:53.718
TRAVIS: Yeah. Locked away after the Calamity, but
real nasty.

01:33:53.718 --> 01:33:58.455
LIAM: Do you have a lot of knowledge for the gods
and religions of the world?

01:33:58.455 --> 01:34:02.877
TRAVIS: Not really, it's more like I remember from
a dream or something. Kind of hard to remember if

01:34:02.877 --> 01:34:04.984
it happened to me or not.

01:34:04.984 --> 01:34:10.569
LIAM: The awe-inspiring one with the face is from
a dream you had?

01:34:10.569 --> 01:34:12.750
SAM: Was it the salt-water dream?

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:15.601
TRAVIS: No. I don't think so. Could be.

01:34:15.601 --> 01:34:23.574
SAM: You need to work on vivid dreams. You can
control yourself-- Lucid dreaming, yeah.

01:34:23.574 --> 01:34:24.959
TRAVIS: How do you do that?

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:27.091
SAM: I don't know. I think it's crystals or
something?

01:34:27.091 --> 01:34:30.764
LAURA: You can keep a dream journal. That's a good
way to do it.

01:34:30.764 --> 01:34:33.327
SAM: When you wake up, you just write.

01:34:33.327 --> 01:34:36.697
LAURA: Write it down immediately what you
remember. It really helps.

01:34:36.697 --> 01:34:44.360
LIAM: I would like to do an insight check on Fjord
while he tells us that story. Pretty good, 20.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.338
MATT: Best you can tell, he's telling the truth.

01:34:49.468 --> 01:34:50.884
TRAVIS: As per usual.

01:34:52.724 --> 01:34:53.682
LIAM: Whack!

01:34:56.422 --> 01:35:04.975
MARISHA: Well, I think this information about the
teleportation-y circle situation could be useful

01:35:04.975 --> 01:35:08.750
leverage if he wants to try and take that sword
off of your back.

01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:17.504
ASHLEY: I feel like rich people like candlesticks,
so I could take the candlesticks with us.

01:35:17.504 --> 01:35:23.896
TRAVIS: Yeah, what are they made of? Can we tell
what kind of metal those candlesticks are made of?

01:35:23.896 --> 01:35:26.487
LIAM: Well, Nott and I could tell you.

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:29.766
MATT: They look like they're made out of nice
metal. They're not made out platinum or anything,

01:35:29.766 --> 01:35:32.503
but they're fine candle lamps. Could be a
silver-like material.

01:35:32.503 --> 01:35:35.766
ASHLEY: They're antique, you know, for
decoration?

01:35:35.766 --> 01:35:37.658
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah, man. Melt that down.

01:35:37.658 --> 01:35:40.291
ASHLEY: They'll probably want those instead of the
sword.

01:35:40.291 --> 01:35:43.280
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:49.213
MARISHA: I say we keep this teleportation a
secret, unless he tries to start bargaining for shit.

01:35:49.213 --> 01:35:50.482
TRAVIS: Natural one.

01:35:50.482 --> 01:35:58.809
MATT: Another natural one. You have a hard time
telling what kind of metal this is.

01:35:58.809 --> 01:36:00.470
LAURA: Are we going to tell him about the sword?

01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:01.150
MARISHA: Not unless he asks.

01:36:01.150 --> 01:36:02.776
TRAVIS: Pretty sure it's aluminum.

01:36:02.776 --> 01:36:04.487
LAURA: Only if he notices the sword.

01:36:04.487 --> 01:36:10.111
LIAM: You know, I think we give him the things of
monetary value. We are thinking long-term for this

01:36:10.111 --> 01:36:17.286
group, working together. This book and that blade
are going to ensure a greater success and cohesion

01:36:17.286 --> 01:36:18.496
in the future.

01:36:18.496 --> 01:36:19.588
MARISHA: That's what we're saying.

01:36:20.306 --> 01:36:21.340
LIAM: Then we are as one.

01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:25.524
LAURA: I can try to fit it in the bag.

01:36:25.524 --> 01:36:27.695
SAM: What if it rips? I don't think it's a good
idea.

01:36:27.695 --> 01:36:29.373
LAURA: If it pierces, it's bad.

01:36:29.373 --> 01:36:33.815
LIAM: Can we try to do it but go with the hilt
downward? See what happens?

01:36:33.815 --> 01:36:39.398
SAM: Why don't we try to camouflage it? We could
wrap it in reeds.

01:36:39.398 --> 01:36:42.241
LAURA: Rub some of the ash on it!

01:36:42.241 --> 01:36:48.815
ASHLEY: What if I have you on my shoulders? Like a
kid?

01:36:48.815 --> 01:36:50.917
SAM: Sure, yeah, of course. That's normally how I
like to travel.

01:36:50.917 --> 01:36:52.931
ASHLEY: We put-- behind us.

01:36:52.931 --> 01:36:55.092
LAURA: Like it can be up your butt!

01:36:55.092 --> 01:36:57.717
SAM: How would that work? In front of me?

01:36:57.717 --> 01:36:59.894
ASHLEY: It's connected to-- That's not going to
work.

01:36:59.894 --> 01:37:03.998
SAM: No, I like this. I could drape myself over
it.

01:37:03.998 --> 01:37:06.369
LIAM: What all is in that haversack that you
have?

01:37:06.369 --> 01:37:11.822
LAURA: I have some crossbow bolts, and this
crowbar, and the sledgehammer--

01:37:11.822 --> 01:37:14.018
LIAM: Can we take out everything except for--

01:37:14.018 --> 01:37:19.296
LAURA: I have this longsword. I have these old
vases that we're going to give him. I have this

01:37:19.296 --> 01:37:27.871
old dodecahedron, and I open up the lead box. This
is really taking up a lot of space.

01:37:27.871 --> 01:37:29.520
LIAM: Caleb starts looking at the do--

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.793
LAURA: I start shoving it all back in.

01:37:31.793 --> 01:37:33.625
TRAVIS: I forgot we got that.

01:37:33.625 --> 01:37:35.909
MARISHA: How did you forget we got that?

01:37:35.909 --> 01:37:40.749
SAM: Oh wait, where's our dynamite? Didn't we have
dynamite? I mean, boom sticks?

01:37:40.749 --> 01:37:43.515
LAURA: We have boom sticks?

01:37:43.515 --> 01:37:45.949
SAM: Yeah, don't we have two boom sticks?

01:37:45.949 --> 01:37:47.138
MATT: You have two you never used from the fight.

01:37:47.138 --> 01:37:47.926
SAM: Who has them?

01:37:47.926 --> 01:37:49.082
MARISHA: I have one, I think?

01:37:49.082 --> 01:37:50.714
SAM: Don't we have drugs?!

01:37:50.714 --> 01:37:52.722
MARISHA: We have mushrooms!

01:37:52.722 --> 01:37:54.173
LIAM: (shouting) Jester!

01:37:54.173 --> 01:37:56.172
LAURA: I'm listening! What?

01:37:56.767 --> 01:37:59.490
LIAM: I know you are, but I am cutting through the
noise. Can we not take everything out of that bag

01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:04.777
except for this new blade and the dodecahedron?
Everything else comes out, because the rest is

01:38:04.777 --> 01:38:06.883
pretty utility, is it not?

01:38:06.883 --> 01:38:09.641
MARISHA: Well it's eight cubic square feet.

01:38:09.641 --> 01:38:11.988
LAURA: It might work, we can try to fit it.

01:38:11.988 --> 01:38:15.799
LIAM: Yeah, we can tie a rag around the end of the
blade to keep it from piercing anything.

01:38:15.799 --> 01:38:17.760
LAURA: Yeah, does it have a scabbard?

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:20.827
MATT: No, it does not. It was ornamentally placed
on the wall.

01:38:20.827 --> 01:38:24.330
LAURA: We should probably get one of those made.

01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:26.253
SAM: I don't know about this.

01:38:26.253 --> 01:38:33.251
LIAM: I pull off the new cloak that I got a
handful of days ago. We can wrap this around the

01:38:33.251 --> 01:38:34.904
blade so it will not pierce.

01:38:34.904 --> 01:38:37.539
TALIESIN: Tie it up and bundle it.

01:38:37.539 --> 01:38:39.439
LIAM: Of course that will work.

01:38:39.439 --> 01:38:44.639
LAURA: It works. It doesn't get pierced from the
inside. It can only be pierced from the outside, right?

01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:45.839
MARISHA: Yeah, it's magical!

01:38:45.839 --> 01:38:46.967
MATT: Are you trying to place the blade inside?

01:38:46.967 --> 01:38:47.582
LAURA: Yeah.

01:38:47.582 --> 01:38:51.670
MATT: You place it into there. It gets to the
hilt, and it won't go all the way in.

01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:53.515
LAURA: It's too big!

01:38:53.515 --> 01:38:54.842
MATT: You have too much stuff in it.

01:38:54.842 --> 01:39:00.731
LAURA: What if I take the sledgehammer out? I'll
take the sledgehammer out.

01:39:00.731 --> 01:39:02.917
LIAM: The sledgehammer we leave. It's a
<i>sledgehammer.</i>

01:39:02.917 --> 01:39:05.582
LAURA: Will it fit once I take the sledgehammer
out?

01:39:05.582 --> 01:39:08.426
LIAM: Everything but the dodecahedron.

01:39:08.426 --> 01:39:16.058
MATT: The unfortunate thing is, it's a very long
blade in comparison to other points. The space

01:39:16.058 --> 01:39:19.936
itself is somewhat amorphous, but you consider it
still a central space.

01:39:19.936 --> 01:39:22.121
LIAM: What if roll the sword up like a Fruit
Roll-up?

01:39:22.121 --> 01:39:24.540
LAURA: I don't think the sword is going to fucking
fit. Here.

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.353
MARISHA: I still like Yasha's idea.

01:39:26.353 --> 01:39:28.102
SAM: Let's try Yasha's idea.

01:39:28.102 --> 01:39:31.235
MARISHA: Just slip it up your back robe.

01:39:31.235 --> 01:39:37.167
ASHLEY: I can slip it up my back and then you can
be on my shoulders like you're tired or something?

01:39:37.379 --> 01:39:39.052
LIAM: Wear my cloak if you want to cover it.

01:39:39.052 --> 01:39:41.592
ASHLEY: Nott can put her legs out.

01:39:41.592 --> 01:39:46.008
TRAVIS: We should probably get back. We've been
here awhile.

01:39:46.008 --> 01:39:48.534
LAURA: He probably thinks we're dead, you guys.

01:39:48.534 --> 01:39:51.428
TRAVIS: Well, we almost were.

01:39:51.428 --> 01:39:52.877
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

01:39:52.877 --> 01:39:54.126
TRAVIS: We head out.

01:39:54.126 --> 01:39:59.056
LIAM: I hang out at the back of the group for a
split second, and hold out that wire that I used

01:39:59.056 --> 01:40:04.341
to cast that cantrip and look at the room and I
look at the wire. Then I follow everybody.

01:40:04.341 --> 01:40:10.803
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way back up through
the chamber where you had the encounter with the

01:40:10.803 --> 01:40:18.277
gelatinous cube and solved the riddle of the
hidden interior of this research facility. You

01:40:18.277 --> 01:40:23.203
make your way through the no longer trapped
chambers, still tenuously held on the various

01:40:23.203 --> 01:40:24.198
pressure plates.

01:40:24.198 --> 01:40:28.743
LAURA: Oh man, we should have tried to go through
that teleportation circle.

01:40:28.743 --> 01:40:30.209
LIAM: It was broken.

01:40:30.209 --> 01:40:31.997
LAURA: Yeah, we should have tried harder.

01:40:31.997 --> 01:40:36.341
MARISHA: They worship some weird shit. Who knows
what dark corners of the world it goes to.

01:40:36.341 --> 01:40:38.428
TALIESIN: I wonder if you'll come out in one of
the Nine Hells but only a third of you.

01:40:38.428 --> 01:40:41.389
LIAM: What we would have done is face-planted on
the stone floor.

01:40:41.389 --> 01:40:47.839
MARISHA: We're going to start with just trying to
give him the rings and the art, right? Rings, art,

01:40:47.839 --> 01:40:49.199
shit-- Keep everything else.

01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:51.153
LAURA and MARISHA: And the candlesticks.

01:40:51.153 --> 01:40:53.532
SAM: I think the god of gods wants to say
something.

01:40:53.532 --> 01:40:57.516
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you continue up the spiral staircase, coming to

01:40:57.516 --> 01:41:02.199
where the wall had been blown down and then
cleared out for you guys to enter. There, as you

01:41:02.199 --> 01:41:08.046
hear the familiar sound of rushing water, you
climb out back into the much cooler air flow

01:41:08.046 --> 01:41:12.723
that's blowing through the subterranean tunnel.
There, your two boats are still affixed, pulled up

01:41:12.723 --> 01:41:15.007
onto the edge of the river.

01:41:15.007 --> 01:41:22.416
LIAM: Can I say that as soon as I left this
chamber I tagged along behind my new monk best

01:41:22.416 --> 01:41:27.687
friend and sent the globules in the air around us
even though she has the goggles, and I'm, while

01:41:27.687 --> 01:41:34.234
walking, trying to read every page of that
journal. And will continue to do so on the boats.

01:41:34.234 --> 01:41:36.322
LAURA: Thank you for saving me, Molly.

01:41:36.322 --> 01:41:37.491
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:39.397
LAURA: Thank you for saving me, Fjord.

01:41:39.397 --> 01:41:40.542
TRAVIS: No problem.

01:41:40.542 --> 01:41:42.935
MATT: So who's taking which boat?

01:41:42.935 --> 01:41:45.103
ASHLEY: I would like to get in a boat with Caleb.

01:41:45.103 --> 01:41:47.766
MATT: Yasha and Caleb on one side.

01:41:47.766 --> 01:41:48.516
SAM: And me.

01:41:48.516 --> 01:41:49.754
ASHLEY: And Nott.

01:41:49.754 --> 01:41:52.225
MATT: The rest in the other?

01:41:52.225 --> 01:41:54.358
LAURA: I have to go in the other boat.

01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:56.412
SAM: You're the motor.

01:41:56.412 --> 01:42:02.176
MATT: Are you guys going up back where you came?

01:42:02.176 --> 01:42:04.819
SAM: Does the river keep going?

01:42:04.819 --> 01:42:09.064
MATT: The river continues going, yeah. It forked
ahead where you were.

01:42:09.064 --> 01:42:12.069
TRAVIS: Current goes away from the direction we
came from?

01:42:12.069 --> 01:42:17.248
MATT: Correct, but it's not a strong current. It's
a lazy-going current, but you could row up. It's a

01:42:17.248 --> 01:42:18.347
little harder to do.

01:42:18.347 --> 01:42:20.051
TRAVIS: We could see what's down the river a bit.

01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:23.700
LIAM: If we want to go back, our two muscle
sisters could get us up this current for sure.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:25.469
MATT: You could. It would be tiring.

01:42:25.469 --> 01:42:29.549
TRAVIS: We're already out this far. Might as well
see where it goes for a little bit.

01:42:29.549 --> 01:42:32.469
SAM: It could be scary. There could be more rock
monsters and things.

01:42:32.469 --> 01:42:34.637
TALIESIN: There are literally going to be rock
monsters if we go back the other way.

01:42:34.637 --> 01:42:39.489
LIAM: Yeah, if we are doing that, then I suggest
camping in this chamber before going forward,

01:42:39.489 --> 01:42:42.026
because we are all bloodied and battered, you
know.

01:42:42.026 --> 01:42:43.651
TRAVIS: Sure. We could do that.

01:42:43.651 --> 01:42:45.892
LAURA: It has been a really long day so far.

01:42:45.892 --> 01:42:47.639
SAM: What time is it?

01:42:47.639 --> 01:42:49.616
MATT: Make a survival check, Nott.

01:42:49.616 --> 01:42:51.579
LIAM: I would know what time of day it is.

01:42:51.579 --> 01:42:53.266
MATT: You would because of your feat.

01:42:53.266 --> 01:42:55.687
SAM: And so would I because I rolled an 18!

01:42:55.687 --> 01:42:59.871
MATT: The two of you know that in the time you
spent traveling down here in the subterranean

01:42:59.871 --> 01:43:05.162
area, resting and going through these battles--
and you left midday. It's when you had arrived to

01:43:05.162 --> 01:43:09.445
begin your journey here. It's getting pretty close
to dusk. Not quite yet. The sun hasn't set.

01:43:09.445 --> 01:43:16.551
SAM: We could go a little ways, and then come back
if we don't find anything.

01:43:16.551 --> 01:43:22.366
LIAM: I don't think we should go. We either go
back the way we came, or we camp before going forward.

01:43:22.366 --> 01:43:23.566
MARISHA: We could do a scout boat.

01:43:23.566 --> 01:43:27.352
LAURA: Or we go check out what's farther along.

01:43:27.352 --> 01:43:30.728
MARISHA: Maybe one boat stays behind, the other
scouts it out?

01:43:30.728 --> 01:43:33.593
LIAM: I'm going to stay behind. I am out.

01:43:33.593 --> 01:43:35.688
LAURA and MARISHA: Separate the party!

01:43:35.688 --> 01:43:38.607
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: I'll go forward.

01:43:38.607 --> 01:43:39.745
MARISHA: I'll check it out.

01:43:39.745 --> 01:43:40.780
LIAM: Terrible idea.

01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:43.888
MARISHA: It's our boat? Our boat scouts.

01:43:43.888 --> 01:43:45.613
LAURA: Just a little bit.

01:43:45.613 --> 01:43:46.800
TALIESIN: Not far.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:53.586
MARISHA: I use my staff to help navigate,
Jester--

01:43:53.586 --> 01:43:55.374
TALIESIN and SAM: This is a terrible idea.

01:43:55.374 --> 01:43:57.150
MATT: Yasha, Nott, and Caleb are staying behind.

01:43:57.150 --> 01:43:59.757
ASHLEY: I'll watch over these guys.

01:43:59.757 --> 01:44:02.026
MATT: You keep watch. The four of you guys--

01:44:02.026 --> 01:44:04.386
SAM: I'll watch over these guys.

01:44:05.246 --> 01:44:06.415
ASHLEY: Okay, Nott.

01:44:06.415 --> 01:44:11.092
MATT: The rest of you get into one of the boats,
push off, catch up onto the current, and begin to

01:44:11.092 --> 01:44:13.481
lazily drift further down the cavern.

01:44:13.481 --> 01:44:15.082
LAURA: I feel like this is stupid.

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:15.866
SAM: Bye, guys.

01:44:15.866 --> 01:44:17.398
LAURA: See you never.

01:44:17.398 --> 01:44:20.210
TRAVIS: We'll be back. We're just taking a little
look.

01:44:20.210 --> 01:44:22.505
TALIESIN: We're only going an hour down, tops.

01:44:22.505 --> 01:44:23.956
MARISHA: I light a torch.

01:44:23.956 --> 01:44:28.687
MATT: The light picks up and spells out the
interior of this chamber.

01:44:28.687 --> 01:44:30.607
TRAVIS: Keep an eye on the roof, remember?

01:44:30.607 --> 01:44:34.292
LAURA: If the current starts to pick up, we're
going to fight it and try to go back, yes?

01:44:34.292 --> 01:44:41.880
LIAM: As they float away out of earshot, I say to
my two friends here: you know, if need be, The

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:44.255
Mighty <i>Drei</i> also sounds very cool.

01:44:44.255 --> 01:44:46.583
TALIESIN: Are we taking a cat?

01:44:46.583 --> 01:44:50.751
LAURA: Yeah! Oh, I don't think it works that far
away from him.

01:44:50.751 --> 01:44:56.025
LIAM: No, Frumpkin is scarfing around my neck
right now.

01:44:56.025 --> 01:45:05.150
MATT: You guys travel for about ten or 15 minutes
down before another cavern merges with the one

01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:09.734
you're in. It looks like another side of the river
seems to merge with yours.

01:45:09.734 --> 01:45:12.627
LAURA: Oh, that's where the fork was. It comes
back together.

01:45:12.627 --> 01:45:13.835
MARISHA: We're back to the fork.

01:45:13.835 --> 01:45:18.736
MATT: Well, you're back where the fork seems to
re-merge with the path you've been taking. As you

01:45:18.736 --> 01:45:21.631
turn back onto where that happens, what do you
do?

01:45:21.631 --> 01:45:24.439
MARISHA: We're going down that other path, right?

01:45:24.439 --> 01:45:26.510
LAURA: Yeah, keep going straight ahead.

01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:29.592
MATT: Are you guys continuing to go downriver or
are you going--

01:45:29.592 --> 01:45:31.717
LAURA: We're turning back and going the other
way?

01:45:31.717 --> 01:45:35.973
TRAVIS: We could check out the other cavern and
save the deeper part of the river for when we're together.

01:45:35.973 --> 01:45:37.645
TALIESIN: That's fair. Let's just--

01:45:37.645 --> 01:45:39.438
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're fighting up.

01:45:39.438 --> 01:45:44.262
MATT: Jester turns it around and begins going
against the current and pulling you guys up--

01:45:44.262 --> 01:45:46.950
TRAVIS: I get behind Jester and start massaging
her traps.

01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:52.207
MATT: There you go. Switchback towards the other
avenue of the fork, and you guys continue up

01:45:52.398 --> 01:45:57.178
there. It takes a little while longer, and it's a
little tiring. For the heck of it, make a

01:45:57.178 --> 01:45:58.719
constitution check, please.

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:04.665
LAURA: Constitution check? That's pretty good.
16.

01:46:04.665 --> 01:46:09.938
MATT: No sweat. You're making it up the river
without an issue. Your muscles are holding. It's

01:46:09.938 --> 01:46:11.281
fine. You are a beast.

01:46:11.281 --> 01:46:12.695
SAM: You have some sweat right here.

01:46:12.695 --> 01:46:20.232
MATT: Eventually, the sound of rushing water gets
louder and louder. You glance up in the direction

01:46:20.232 --> 01:46:24.321
where you're coming from, and there's a fine mist
in the air, a spray.

01:46:24.321 --> 01:46:25.390
LAURA: Oh no, there's a waterfall.

01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:31.954
MATT: It looks like there is a waterfall that you
guys are at the bottom of. It's about a 15-foot

01:46:31.954 --> 01:46:36.940
drop from above to the bottom of where you are.
You'd have to climb to get to the top, and you

01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:42.197
have no idea how to get a boat up there. You get
the sense that if you had gone the other way down

01:46:42.197 --> 01:46:45.086
here, you would've suddenly had a waterfall drop.

01:46:45.086 --> 01:46:48.333
TRAVIS: Is there land off to the sides of the
bottom of the waterfall?

01:46:48.333 --> 01:46:52.673
MATT: Very thin, a half a foot to a foot, but
there are a lot of stones and rocks that have

01:46:52.673 --> 01:46:57.159
tumbled through the river over time and set at the
bottom that would've destroyed a boat that had

01:46:57.159 --> 01:46:58.718
fallen off the edge of that waterfall.

01:46:58.718 --> 01:46:59.396
TALIESIN: Good to know.

01:46:59.396 --> 01:47:02.578
LAURA: Does it seem like there are any boats that
are broken at the bottom of it?

01:47:02.578 --> 01:47:07.749
MATT: You can make an investigation check as
you're rowing up to the edge, glancing over the side.

01:47:07.749 --> 01:47:09.607
LAURA: Is there anywhere to stop the boat?

01:47:09.607 --> 01:47:11.697
MATT: This would be more of a perception check
because you can't really investigate. You're not

01:47:11.697 --> 01:47:12.383
poring through it.

01:47:12.383 --> 01:47:13.052
TALIESIN: I'll join this.

01:47:13.052 --> 01:47:15.058
MATT: There's no place to pull the boat off to the
side.

01:47:15.058 --> 01:47:16.692
TALIESIN: Is there a place to tie it off?

01:47:16.692 --> 01:47:22.542
MATT: There are only really the stones here, and
they're pretty slick.

01:47:22.542 --> 01:47:24.615
LAURA: I only rolled a ten.

01:47:24.615 --> 01:47:28.694
MATT: You don't see any remnants of broken ship or
boat.

01:47:28.694 --> 01:47:32.821
TALIESIN: Perception. That would have been ten,
again.

01:47:32.821 --> 01:47:37.554
MATT: Yeah, it's hard to tell in this vicinity.
You do see the water crashing down a little, so

01:47:37.554 --> 01:47:41.252
there are a couple of small platforms on the way
that it's hitting and splashing off again. The

01:47:41.252 --> 01:47:42.502
spray is causing all this--

01:47:42.502 --> 01:47:47.509
LAURA: Is the waterfall really hardcore? Could we
see if there's anything behind the waterfall?

01:47:47.509 --> 01:47:54.290
MATT: Well, at the moment, no. From what you can
see in the vicinity, you see the water rushing down.

01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:57.167
MARISHA: Can I get a little bit closer? I can
poke.

01:47:57.635 --> 01:47:59.130
LIAM: Find Clarota again.

01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:03.069
LAURA: I try to get closer so that she can poke
through the waterfall.

01:48:03.069 --> 01:48:08.676
MARISHA: I'm going to take my staff and jab it
behind there, see if there's anything.

01:48:08.676 --> 01:48:12.831
MATT: On one end, it hits rock. Does not.

01:48:12.831 --> 01:48:15.074
(gasping)

01:48:15.074 --> 01:48:16.764
MATT: There's a little space behind the water.

01:48:16.764 --> 01:48:17.557
LAURA: Should we go?

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:19.824
MARISHA: There's always shit behind waterfalls. I
think we should.

01:48:19.824 --> 01:48:21.668
LAURA: Do you think it's going to bludgeon us?

01:48:21.668 --> 01:48:24.979
TALIESIN: I'm already taking off my jacket. I'm
taking off everything that I don't want to get

01:48:24.979 --> 01:48:29.506
wet, keeping just one sword, and I'm going to go
for it.

01:48:29.506 --> 01:48:31.291
LIAM: Nipple rings in or out?

01:48:31.291 --> 01:48:34.697
TALIESIN: Weirdly, there are no nipple rings.
Those things are dangerous. They catch on shit.

01:48:34.697 --> 01:48:35.905
LIAM: Insight check.

01:48:35.905 --> 01:48:37.204
MATT: They're not there.

01:48:37.204 --> 01:48:39.292
TALIESIN: 16.

01:48:39.292 --> 01:48:41.977
MATT: Molly jumps off the boat.

01:48:41.977 --> 01:48:43.923
LAURA: Oh, you're going? You're jumping now?

01:48:43.923 --> 01:48:44.903
TALIESIN: I'm going in.

01:48:44.903 --> 01:48:46.478
LAURA: You're not going to try to get the boat
through?

01:48:46.478 --> 01:48:48.751
TRAVIS: I'm not letting him go by himself. I do
the same thing.

01:48:48.751 --> 01:48:52.102
LAURA: I try to get the boat through.

01:48:52.102 --> 01:49:01.263
MATT: You row the boat. You pull through the
waterfall and the boat (cracks). The opening is

01:49:01.263 --> 01:49:06.943
not wide enough for the boat, and it jams up into
the space and gets lodged, and the waterfall is on

01:49:06.943 --> 01:49:10.605
you guys and in the boat. It's filling up the
boat.

01:49:10.605 --> 01:49:13.275
LAURA: I save the boat! Okay, I try to push off
and not sink the boat.

01:49:13.275 --> 01:49:15.003
MATT: Make a strength check.

01:49:15.003 --> 01:49:16.840
MARISHA: Can I help her push off?

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.031
MATT: Yeah, so you have advantage because she's
aiding you with this.

01:49:20.031 --> 01:49:22.357
LAURA: Jeez. Oh, much better.

01:49:22.357 --> 01:49:23.942
MATT: What did you roll?

01:49:23.942 --> 01:49:24.831
LAURA: 21.

01:49:24.831 --> 01:49:30.872
MATT: 21. Yeah, that'll do it. You push away from
the waterfall. Actually, I'm going to pull up some

01:49:30.872 --> 01:49:32.433
audio for this because I have it.

01:49:36.233 --> 01:49:40.848
LAURA: I really want to go see what's behind the
waterfall, but I don't want to lose the boat.

01:49:40.848 --> 01:49:42.573
TALIESIN: I'm crawling up into it, man.

01:49:42.573 --> 01:49:45.027
LAURA: We'll lose the boat if I jump out of the
boat.

01:49:45.027 --> 01:49:48.432
MARISHA: Will it go anywhere, though? This is the
end of it. It's stuck in the chamber?

01:49:48.432 --> 01:49:51.294
TALIESIN: No, because it's going to have a flow,
because the water is coming down. We have to tie

01:49:51.294 --> 01:49:52.931
it off on something.

01:49:52.931 --> 01:49:55.033
LAURA: Is there anything to tie the boat on?

01:49:55.033 --> 01:49:57.074
MATT: There is nothing here, unfortunately. It's
slick rocks.

01:49:57.074 --> 01:49:58.989
LAURA: Do you see anything on the other side?

01:49:58.989 --> 01:50:00.637
TALIESIN: I'll let you know when I get there.

01:50:00.637 --> 01:50:03.284
MATT: He's swimming, making his way through at the
moment.

01:50:03.714 --> 01:50:09.959
TALIESIN: Yeah. Where is it? I'm so excited. I
want to hear your white noise.

01:50:09.959 --> 01:50:12.650
SAM: In cold water?

01:50:12.650 --> 01:50:15.478
LAURA: It'll be like a cold peppermint drink.
It'll be good.

01:50:15.478 --> 01:50:16.933
SAM: I don't think it works like that.

01:50:16.933 --> 01:50:18.661
LAURA: It does because I've been doing it at
home.

01:50:23.691 --> 01:50:25.264
MATT: You make your way through--

01:50:25.264 --> 01:50:26.416
ASHLEY: Much better.

01:50:26.416 --> 01:50:33.378
MATT: There you go. Keep it thematic. You come up
from underneath and you can see, as soon as you

01:50:33.378 --> 01:50:39.556
come up and reach out your feet and your hands,
both of you guys begin to catch soft river floor,

01:50:39.556 --> 01:50:45.241
and eventually it comes up to a plateau, and this
is a small, enclosed chamber in the inside.

01:50:45.241 --> 01:50:48.895
TALIESIN: (laughter) I've always wanted to do
this.

01:50:48.895 --> 01:50:51.029
TRAVIS: Darkvision. Do I see anything?

01:50:51.029 --> 01:50:53.111
MATT: It only goes back about ten or so feet.

01:50:53.111 --> 01:50:55.729
SAM: (Clarota voice) Welcome to my home.

01:50:55.729 --> 01:50:59.710
MATT: (Clarota voice) It's been a while.

01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:03.761
LIAM: (Clarota voice) Time is a circle.

01:51:03.761 --> 01:51:18.926
MATT: He's folding beer cans into little shapes.
What's an alhoon to do? Anyway, you guys come out

01:51:18.926 --> 01:51:23.659
of the water and quickly glance, as your hair's
drenched on the sides of your face-- except for

01:51:23.659 --> 01:51:31.907
you. It's short enough hair. On the inside, it's
fairly empty, except for a skeleton. A humanoid

01:51:31.907 --> 01:51:39.597
skeleton against a back wall that is laying there.
It has manacles or chains attached to its wrists,

01:51:39.597 --> 01:51:44.137
neck, and feet, and they're all connected by a
singular chain in the center, and it's resting

01:51:44.137 --> 01:51:46.586
there, and it's probably been here for a while.

01:51:46.586 --> 01:51:47.510
TRAVIS: That's bad luck.

01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:52.074
TALIESIN: We seem to keep finding these. I am
going to examine this thing.

01:51:52.074 --> 01:51:54.506
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:51:56.424 --> 01:51:57.561
TALIESIN: Seven.

01:51:57.561 --> 01:52:06.107
MATT: I mean, the body's pretty rotted. It looks
like whatever clothing they're wearing is very

01:52:06.107 --> 01:52:10.871
basic material that is-- It would be more
disintegrated if there wasn't so much moisture in

01:52:10.871 --> 01:52:15.464
the area, and it looks like bits of it have been
eaten away with fungus and mold over time. The

01:52:15.464 --> 01:52:21.596
manacles are very well made, and looking at the
edges where they connect, there's a small rune at

01:52:21.596 --> 01:52:22.486
that point.

01:52:22.486 --> 01:52:29.017
TRAVIS: No scratches in the walls or any pouches
or compartments on the floor around this little space?

01:52:29.017 --> 01:52:31.115
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:52:33.495 --> 01:52:35.061
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

01:52:35.061 --> 01:52:40.627
MATT: Glancing around the interior of the chamber,
unfortunately, there are no secret compartments or

01:52:40.936 --> 01:52:47.503
any alcoves. It looks like whoever was in here may
have been an individual who escaped from a boat

01:52:47.503 --> 01:52:54.704
that was unprepared for the fall, and whoever was
rowing them down this chamber either didn't

01:52:54.704 --> 01:53:01.543
survive or didn't know about this hidden alcove,
and this individual was in here until they passed away.

01:53:01.543 --> 01:53:03.810
TRAVIS: What do those manacles look like?

01:53:04.230 --> 01:53:04.994
TALIESIN: Magic.

01:53:04.994 --> 01:53:10.228
TRAVIS: Oh, we could use those. I'll walk over and
I step on the elbow joint and snap it.

01:53:10.228 --> 01:53:16.296
MATT: As you do, the whole skeleton implodes
entirely, and the manacles slip off as the

01:53:16.296 --> 01:53:20.808
different joints pull apart and alleviate the
manacles. Now you're holding the center chain, so

01:53:20.808 --> 01:53:25.879
you have the neck ring, the wrist and the ankle
rings all dangling from this cluster of chain

01:53:25.879 --> 01:53:26.969
you're holding.

01:53:26.969 --> 01:53:32.107
TALIESIN: I will pick up the skull and take a look
at it. It is human?

01:53:32.107 --> 01:53:34.710
MATT: It appears to be human. Make a medicine
check.

01:53:34.710 --> 01:53:40.743
TALIESIN: All these checks. Where's my medicine?
There. 12.

01:53:40.743 --> 01:53:45.438
MATT: Looking at the features of the skull,
they're a little bit more delicate than an average

01:53:45.438 --> 01:53:52.578
human's skull. You get the sense they may be of
partial elven blood. Not full elf, but partial elf.

01:53:52.578 --> 01:53:54.343
SAM: Never go full elf.

01:53:54.343 --> 01:54:00.906
TALIESIN: Very true. Well, on your way, Yorick. I
set it adrift.

01:54:01.412 --> 01:54:04.617
TRAVIS: Yep, put the manacles over and I'll jump
back in.

01:54:04.617 --> 01:54:08.550
TALIESIN: I'm going to also keep my eyes open. I'm
going to try to get a little bit down into this to

01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:11.864
see if there's any bits and pieces underwater.

01:54:11.864 --> 01:54:13.471
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

01:54:13.471 --> 01:54:15.468
MATT: Make an investigation check when you came
back in the water.

01:54:15.468 --> 01:54:16.528
TALIESIN: Do a little pat down.

01:54:16.528 --> 01:54:18.900
TRAVIS: Can I aid him or help him do something?

01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:23.995
MATT: Sure. You guys both go down there. You roll
twice, with advantage, then. The help action

01:54:23.995 --> 01:54:25.468
allows you to--

01:54:25.468 --> 01:54:26.124
TALIESIN: 18.

01:54:26.124 --> 01:54:33.954
MATT: Looking down below there, you do see at the
bottom, mostly covered in masses of soft dirt and

01:54:33.954 --> 01:54:44.390
silt, pieces of broken ship, and amongst the
jagged rocks, it looks like more than one. A few

01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:51.016
ships have met their end at the base of this
waterfall, definitely. Beyond that, you don't

01:54:51.016 --> 01:54:59.313
notice anything of use. You do find a rusted
shortsword and a couple of broken pieces of boxes,

01:54:59.313 --> 01:55:03.028
but anything that was left at the bottom of the
waterfall seems like would have been recovered.

01:55:03.028 --> 01:55:07.340
Anything of worth someone must have come back for
and sifted through because everything down there

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:11.216
is rotted wood and things that weren't useful.

01:55:11.216 --> 01:55:13.700
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to kick my way back
up to the boat.

01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:18.891
MATT: Okay. You guys break the surface and climb
back into the boat.

01:55:21.431 --> 01:55:23.243
MARISHA: Ugh. Gross, Molly.

01:55:26.733 --> 01:55:28.829
LAURA: Did you find anything?

01:55:28.829 --> 01:55:32.649
TALIESIN: A lot of bad decisions. Several boats.

01:55:32.649 --> 01:55:37.492
MATT: As Fjord (impact) over the side and you
see the chains on the inside.

01:55:37.492 --> 01:55:39.655
TALIESIN: Someone who didn't quite get away.

01:55:39.655 --> 01:55:42.098
TRAVIS: Jester, give me a hand?

01:55:42.098 --> 01:55:43.673
LAURA: (Breathy) Okay.

01:55:45.473 --> 01:55:47.654
SAM: (Singing) Oskar!

01:55:47.654 --> 01:55:50.234
TALIESIN: I think I should find that gross, but
I'm kind of into it?

01:55:51.744 --> 01:55:53.273
MARISHA: You know, people are going to start--

01:55:53.273 --> 01:55:55.234
LAURA: I lift him up by his armpits.

01:55:55.234 --> 01:55:59.559
(laughter)

01:55:59.559 --> 01:56:01.165
SAM: Spin him around once?

01:56:03.245 --> 01:56:04.799
LIAM: (Jester voice) You are like my little doll.

01:56:04.799 --> 01:56:11.568
TALIESIN: We did find one interesting thing: a
place to stash things if we don't want them to be found.

01:56:11.568 --> 01:56:15.316
LAURA: Oh that's-- ooh.

01:56:15.794 --> 01:56:18.666
MARISHA: How easy is it to get back down here,
though?

01:56:18.666 --> 01:56:19.940
LIAM: Real difficult.

01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:24.071
TALIESIN: Well. If we come out the other way, then
we know how to get back down here.

01:56:24.071 --> 01:56:25.836
SAM: (as pigeon) Coo! We're never coming back
here, coo!

01:56:25.836 --> 01:56:29.045
(laughter)

01:56:29.045 --> 01:56:31.693
LAURA: It's a good place to hide though, too.

01:56:31.693 --> 01:56:33.380
TALIESIN: Good to know.

01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:40.204
LAURA: Fjord, even wet you're, like, 150?

01:56:40.204 --> 01:56:43.484
(laughter)

01:56:43.484 --> 01:56:46.668
TRAVIS: I am 185 easy, okay?

01:56:46.668 --> 01:56:47.540
TALIESIN: Wet.

01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:47.881
LAURA: Right.

01:56:47.881 --> 01:56:49.735
MARISHA: He is very wet.

01:56:52.725 --> 01:56:55.687
LAURA: Fjord. 150? No?

01:56:55.687 --> 01:56:57.845
SAM: It was good.

01:56:57.845 --> 01:57:02.173
TALIESIN: Somewhere in the world right now,
someone's laughing.

01:57:02.173 --> 01:57:04.987
SAM: I think if you beg for it, it makes it even
better.

01:57:04.987 --> 01:57:07.026
LAURA: It's even better, right?

01:57:07.026 --> 01:57:09.259
MARISHA: Explain that joke. Explain it.

01:57:09.259 --> 01:57:11.732
MATT: What're you guys doing?

01:57:11.732 --> 01:57:15.833
TRAVIS: I think we're good to go back and join the
others, yeah.

01:57:15.833 --> 01:57:17.473
TALIESIN: That was fun.

01:57:17.473 --> 01:57:25.996
MATT: You guys make your way back, fighting the
current. Go ahead and make another constitution check.

01:57:26.231 --> 01:57:32.532
LAURA: Oh shit. I'm getting real tired, you guys--
Oh, I'm not. I'm not getting tired at all,

01:57:32.532 --> 01:57:33.962
actually. 17.

01:57:33.962 --> 01:57:39.549
MATT: Jester's powering through, no issue. You
guys make it back. You join the rest of the crew.

01:57:39.549 --> 01:57:44.275
You see a mildly damp Mollymauk. Actually the
whole crew is damp at this point from being under

01:57:44.275 --> 01:57:45.250
the waterfall.

01:57:45.250 --> 01:57:46.474
LIAM: How long were they gone for?

01:57:46.474 --> 01:57:50.250
MATT: At this point in time with the searching it
would probably be close to an hour or so.

01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:55.654
LIAM: I could probably read an average novel in
over an hour, so has this journal been read?

01:57:55.654 --> 01:58:00.565
MATT: For what you can, yeah. You've read
everything in the journal you can make sense of.

01:58:00.565 --> 01:58:02.082
SAM: While they were gone--

01:58:02.082 --> 01:58:08.424
MATT: Well do you have another spell slot for
Tongues? Well, for Comprehend Languages. Not Tongues.

01:58:08.858 --> 01:58:11.157
LIAM: Oh because it's in a different language. Oh,
yeah.

01:58:11.157 --> 01:58:13.940
MARISHA: The research journal? The research one?

01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:18.829
LIAM: No, because I used my magic thingy to get a
slot back earlier in the day, so no.

01:58:18.829 --> 01:58:23.206
SAM: (as Jester) Technically can't you remember
everything? You just don't understand it?

01:58:23.206 --> 01:58:26.023
LIAM: No, I remember what I skimmed, but I
don't--

01:58:26.023 --> 01:58:27.417
MARISHA: What was it written in?

01:58:27.417 --> 01:58:29.183
MATT: Draconic.

01:58:29.183 --> 01:58:32.439
SAM: You have a photographic memory, don't you?

01:58:32.674 --> 01:58:37.318
LIAM: Of what I skimmed. I have to actually read
it to remember it, and I did not read this entire book.

01:58:37.318 --> 01:58:39.550
MATT: Yeah, you can't cast a spell and then
remember the language. He has to actually--

01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:42.587
LIAM: I don't touch the book to my head and then I
have it. I have to eat the book.

01:58:42.797 --> 01:58:47.960
MATT: Yeah. Just piece by piece. All right. Now
that you've re-joined with your compatriots--

01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:51.901
LAURA: Do we want to long rest or go back?

01:58:51.901 --> 01:58:53.199
LIAM and TALIESIN: Long rest.

01:58:53.199 --> 01:58:54.532
LAURA: Let's camp.

01:58:54.532 --> 01:58:59.711
MATT: All right. You guys take the boats back onto
the side. Where are you resting, here on the side

01:58:59.711 --> 01:59:01.147
of the river?

01:59:01.147 --> 01:59:06.726
LIAM: Oh! What I would have done if they left and
I'm tapped, Caleb would have used a ritual to cast

01:59:06.726 --> 01:59:08.865
Comprehend Languages.

01:59:08.865 --> 01:59:09.814
MATT: It's a ritual spell?

01:59:09.814 --> 01:59:10.377
LIAM: Yeah.

01:59:10.377 --> 01:59:12.001
MATT: All righty, you're fine.

01:59:12.001 --> 01:59:13.443
LIAM: I am up to speed.

01:59:13.443 --> 01:59:14.499
MATT: Then you're good. All righty.

01:59:14.499 --> 01:59:18.248
TRAVIS: We should actually go back inside and use
the entrance as a good funnel. Don't leave

01:59:18.248 --> 01:59:19.845
ourselves in the open.

01:59:19.845 --> 01:59:23.914
MARISHA: Caleb, if you're done with that book do
you think I could hold on to it?

01:59:23.914 --> 01:59:25.329
LIAM: Do you want to read it?

01:59:25.329 --> 01:59:27.083
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd love to. Thank you.

01:59:27.083 --> 01:59:31.618
MATT: You guys pull the boats up on the side, head
back inside. Where are you going to set up camp on

01:59:31.618 --> 01:59:33.202
the inside of the chamber?

01:59:33.202 --> 01:59:37.833
SAM: How about in the place where we disarmed all
the traps? We know that that's safe.

01:59:37.833 --> 01:59:39.801
TALIESIN: That's a bit deep in there.

01:59:39.801 --> 01:59:40.743
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.

01:59:40.743 --> 01:59:43.017
SAM: Well we can't camp in the staircase.

01:59:43.017 --> 01:59:45.785
LAURA: Just inside of the rock collapse?

01:59:45.785 --> 01:59:47.599
SAM: That is a staircase.

01:59:47.599 --> 01:59:48.684
LAURA: It is? Immediately?

01:59:48.684 --> 01:59:49.685
SAM: Yes, immediately.

01:59:49.685 --> 01:59:51.883
LIAM: You are a reader?

01:59:51.883 --> 01:59:53.539
LAURA: Then yeah, at the bottom.

01:59:53.539 --> 01:59:55.522
TRAVIS: Yeah, the top-- or the bottom. The
bottom?

01:59:55.522 --> 01:59:57.656
TALIESIN: I think at the top, personally.

01:59:57.656 --> 02:00:00.727
TRAVIS: Yeah, because the bottom one with the
things, the traps blockers--

02:00:00.727 --> 02:00:02.812
LAURA: Right before the staircase, right inside.

02:00:02.812 --> 02:00:10.430
MATT: You can do that. You guys set up a small
camp area, take whatever bedrolls and materials

02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:15.059
that you have to do the best you can to set up a
space to sleep. You find enough of a division in

02:00:15.059 --> 02:00:27.703
the floor to at least get to a resting point and
you guys begin your evening's long rest. Could I

02:00:27.703 --> 02:00:32.271
have everybody at the table except for Fjord
please leave and go take your break a little early?

02:00:33.234 --> 02:00:35.546
MARISHA: (singing) More bad dreams!

02:00:35.546 --> 02:00:37.545
LAURA: (singing) Because he was in the water
before!

02:00:37.545 --> 02:00:41.094
SAM: (singing) Every time he touches the water he
has backstory!

02:00:41.094 --> 02:00:43.948
TRAVIS: You don't know that!

02:00:43.948 --> 02:00:45.986
LIAM: Fuck that kraken!

02:00:45.986 --> 02:00:49.058
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a whole different show.

02:00:49.058 --> 02:00:50.757
LIAM: It's the same show!

02:00:50.757 --> 02:00:52.924
MARISHA: Crack into a Kraken.

02:00:52.924 --> 02:00:56.745
TRAVIS: Take your time! It's all good.

02:00:56.745 --> 02:00:59.344
LAURA: Sorry, I want to bring this with me that's
all.

02:01:03.204 --> 02:01:04.660
TRAVIS: Oh no. Oh god.

02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:17.449
MATT: The sleep takes you and the darkness of your
dream state alleviates you of the stress of the

02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:27.147
day. Your aching muscles turning numb, your
physical form and consciousness now removed and

02:01:27.147 --> 02:01:37.533
aimless in this dark space. You look down at your
hands, and there you see clasped in your grip the

02:01:37.533 --> 02:01:47.755
hooked and curved blade that you had recently
bound with. In your grasp, you swing it and slowly

02:01:47.755 --> 02:01:55.424
inspect as you do. As you swirl the blade around
in your hand, it almost has a trail around it. As

02:01:55.424 --> 02:02:02.509
you hold it coldly in you grasp, this yellow light
suddenly emerges in front of you, as a familiar,

02:02:02.804 --> 02:02:20.992
large, yellow eye now looks upon you. A voice
fills you, directionless, "Consume." You glance at

02:02:20.992 --> 02:02:30.291
the blade and back at the eye and the voice again
says, "Consume." What do you do?

02:02:30.291 --> 02:02:40.201
TRAVIS: Consume. Oh god, am I going to try to
swallow the sword?

02:02:45.221 --> 02:02:46.362
MATT: What do you do, Fjord?

02:02:53.222 --> 02:02:55.677
TRAVIS: It's a large blade, right?

02:02:55.677 --> 02:03:02.337
MATT: It's about this wide in places. It comes out
and it arcs and curves and has jagged edges on it.

02:03:02.825 --> 02:03:14.037
TRAVIS: I don't know what you mean, consume? Fuck
it, I'll turn the blade over and keeping my eyes

02:03:14.037 --> 02:03:19.609
on the big eye, I'll bring it up to my mouth and
open it.

02:03:19.609 --> 02:03:25.020
MATT: It's cold to the touch of your tongue, the
blade completely absent of any temperature.

02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:29.906
TRAVIS: I'll--

02:03:29.906 --> 02:03:33.962
MATT: As you begin to force it down your gullet,
you feel the edge of the blade hit the back of

02:03:33.962 --> 02:03:39.732
your throat and a moment of pain hits you as it
begins to cut through your flesh. At that point,

02:03:39.732 --> 02:03:44.859
this ravenous hunger begins to build on the inside
of your stomach. Though the pain tells you to pull

02:03:44.859 --> 02:03:51.939
away, you continue to force the blade down. As you
pull it down from the hilt, you feel the blood

02:03:51.939 --> 02:03:57.074
burble up in the back of your throat and spill out
of your chin but you continue to push it until the

02:03:57.074 --> 02:04:04.241
entirety of the blade is consumed within your
throat. You close your eyes for a moment and look

02:04:04.241 --> 02:04:10.791
up at the eye once more. The voice returns to
fill, reverberating around you. The pain subsides

02:04:10.791 --> 02:04:25.600
and it says, "Good." The eye closes. The lid
completely cutting of the source, the cold, the

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.473
liquid, the water around you the sense of being
under the ocean again begins to whisk you away. A

02:04:30.473 --> 02:04:34.241
heavy current begins to pull from behind and you
reach out trying to grasp for any hand or foot

02:04:34.241 --> 02:04:39.454
hold. Yet you have nothing to hold on to. As you
feel yourself being dragged into this endless

02:04:39.454 --> 02:04:52.907
abyss, the dream comes to an end. You wake up.
(panting) Everyone else is asleep in the area. No

02:04:52.907 --> 02:04:55.107
one seems to have woken up from your presence.

02:04:55.107 --> 02:04:56.572
TRAVIS: Anything in my hands?

02:04:56.572 --> 02:04:57.843
MATT: Nothing in your hands, no.

02:04:57.843 --> 02:04:59.013
TRAVIS: I wipe my mouth.

02:04:59.013 --> 02:05:02.163
MATT: Wipe your mouth. There's a little bit of
blood right there across your hand.

02:05:02.163 --> 02:05:05.112
TRAVIS: Can I try and summon the sword?

02:05:05.691 --> 02:05:12.158
MATT: You do and as you summon it, there before
you is not the Wastehunter Blade, but the falchion

02:05:12.158 --> 02:05:19.830
now returned to grasp with a strange, more hooked
and jagged appearance to it. It seems the essence

02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:26.823
of this pact has consumed the weapon you had bound
with and made it one with the falchion you made

02:05:26.823 --> 02:05:29.258
this pact with oh so long ago.

02:05:29.258 --> 02:05:41.619
TRAVIS: I try and keep my-- (clears throat) Fu--
Make it disappear again. Has anybody woken up? Are

02:05:41.619 --> 02:05:43.120
any eyes open at all?

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:46.190
MATT: At the moment, no.

02:05:46.190 --> 02:05:49.763
TRAVIS: I'll lay back down and go to sleep.

02:05:49.763 --> 02:05:52.029
MATT: That's where we'll take our break.

02:05:52.029 --> 02:05:53.603
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

02:05:53.603 --> 02:05:59.215
MATT: We'll be right back, guys. As a reminder, we
do have our giveaway tonight. We have the wenge

02:05:59.215 --> 02:06:05.684
hero vault, which is the awesome dark wood color
from our friends at Wyrmwood. You can contain your

02:06:05.684 --> 02:06:11.930
dice or your character model. This will go to
whoever wins tonight's giveaway. Once again, if

02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:17.089
you are in the U.S or in Canada, you are capable
of winning this tonight, unless you are in Quebec,

02:06:17.089 --> 02:06:24.935
unfortunately. Come on into the Twitch chat right
now. The keyword for tonight's "harvest." You can

02:06:24.935 --> 02:06:28.261
only enter once. If you enter more than once, you
will be unfortunately disqualified from this.

02:06:28.261 --> 02:06:31.418
We'll come back at the end of the break to give
this to the winner, so we'll see you guys here in

02:06:31.418 --> 02:06:32.765
a few minutes. Thanks so much.

02:06:32.765 --> 02:06:34.269
TRAVIS: Oh, you crazy motherfucker!

02:06:34.269 --> 02:06:35.349
MATT: (evil laughter)

02:06:35.349 --> 02:19:04.215
(break)

02:19:04.863 --> 02:19:07.501
MATT: Welcome back everybody! First off we have--

02:19:07.501 --> 02:19:09.566
TRAVIS: Wow, good call back.

02:19:09.566 --> 02:19:10.885
TALIESIN: You did great.

02:19:10.885 --> 02:19:16.552
MATT: Wow, that's my wife, ladies and gentlemen.
Our winner for this evening, for the wonderful

02:19:16.552 --> 02:19:19.650
wenge hero vault is Darkone_Nightshade.

02:19:19.650 --> 02:19:21.500
ALL: Woo!

02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:23.779
MATT: Congratulations, Danoba will get your
contact info and get that sent out to you,

02:19:23.779 --> 02:19:33.579
congrats. All righty, so as you guys all come to
consciousness, in the cold, desolate dark space

02:19:33.579 --> 02:19:41.092
within this long abandoned research facility from
the Age of Arcanum, you stiffly get off the

02:19:41.092 --> 02:19:45.551
ground, collect your stuff. What do you want to
do?

02:19:45.551 --> 02:19:49.991
MARISHA: I do a few push ups to get warmed up.

02:19:50.233 --> 02:19:52.695
MATT: Gotcha. Beau's doing her morning routine.

02:19:52.695 --> 02:19:53.920
MARISHA: Yeah, some squats.

02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:55.374
SAM: Oh, we did a long rest-y?

02:19:55.374 --> 02:19:57.052
LAURA: Yes, we did a long-y rest-y.

02:19:57.052 --> 02:19:59.860
ASHLEY: I would like to sit and attune to the
sword.

02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:01.631
MATT: You attuned to the blade, perfect.

02:20:07.471 --> 02:20:14.353
SAM: Caleb, you were not, I don't want to jinx it
or anything, but I don't think that you were hit

02:20:14.353 --> 02:20:16.976
in any of the fights yesterday, were you?

02:20:16.976 --> 02:20:22.754
LIAM: That is not correct. I was not hit in the
final fight.

02:20:22.754 --> 02:20:27.150
SAM: But you remained pretty much unscathed.

02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:29.824
LIAM: I made out better than usual, yes.

02:20:29.824 --> 02:20:34.967
SAM: And that was the only day that you let me put
flowers in your hair, right?

02:20:34.967 --> 02:20:41.887
LIAM: Okay. I see where you are going.

02:20:41.887 --> 02:20:47.091
SAM: I'm saying, maybe, sometimes old wives' tales
are true!

02:20:47.091 --> 02:20:52.962
LIAM: Well I am not much of a believer in old
wives' tales, but I do like trial and error, so if

02:20:52.962 --> 02:20:54.550
you would like to do it again today--

02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:55.750
SAM: As an experiment.

02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:56.827
LIAM: As an experiment, yes.

02:20:56.827 --> 02:21:00.615
SAM: This is a focus group test thing. I don't
know.

02:21:00.615 --> 02:21:02.812
MARISHA: It's true. You need more than one
example.

02:21:02.812 --> 02:21:04.860
SAM: True. Sample size.

02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:07.004
LIAM: Do we have any more flowers?

02:21:07.004 --> 02:21:08.163
SAM: I have a lot.

02:21:08.163 --> 02:21:10.206
MARISHA: Got to find that average.

02:21:10.206 --> 02:21:11.967
TRAVIS: Standard deviation.

02:21:11.967 --> 02:21:13.130
SAM: May I?

02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:14.153
LIAM: You may.

02:21:14.153 --> 02:21:20.654
SAM: I'm going to take some time to put a little
braid in his hair, and stick a little flower stem

02:21:20.654 --> 02:21:24.355
or two in there, and try to make a little flower
mohawk.

02:21:28.195 --> 02:21:29.616
LIAM: How do I look?

02:21:29.616 --> 02:21:34.845
MARISHA: Like a satyr. Like in those ancient Greek
paintings.

02:21:34.845 --> 02:21:36.557
SAM: Current Greek.

02:21:36.557 --> 02:21:39.655
LAURA and LIAM: What is Greek?

02:21:40.845 --> 02:21:42.168
TRAVIS: (robot voice) What is Greek?

02:21:42.168 --> 02:21:46.602
(laughter)

02:21:46.602 --> 02:21:48.444
LAURA: Are you all wet again?

02:21:48.444 --> 02:21:54.045
MATT: You go and inspect. No, there is no--

02:21:54.045 --> 02:21:57.061
LAURA: No dampness?

02:21:57.061 --> 02:22:01.423
MATT: No sea-foam froth, though there is a bit of
dried blood at the corner of Fjord's mouth.

02:22:01.423 --> 02:22:02.920
SAM: Dried blood?

02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:05.937
LAURA: Fjord, you have a little something right
here.

02:22:05.937 --> 02:22:07.522
SAM: Did you shave?

02:22:07.522 --> 02:22:09.571
LAURA: Did you bite your lip?

02:22:09.571 --> 02:22:12.565
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I fucking grind my teeth.

02:22:12.565 --> 02:22:15.336
SAM: You should wear a bite guard.

02:22:15.336 --> 02:22:20.187
LAURA: Is that why--? Is it a sleep thing?

02:22:20.187 --> 02:22:25.100
TRAVIS: No, no, nope. Just bit myself in my sleep,
that's all.

02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:26.713
ASHLEY: Wait, is that why what?

02:22:26.713 --> 02:22:28.659
LAURA: Is that why, well you know.

02:22:28.659 --> 02:22:29.265
SAM: What?

02:22:29.265 --> 02:22:32.935
LAURA: (whispering) Well I don't want to say
anything. I'm afraid it will offend him.

02:22:32.935 --> 02:22:34.956
SAM: You can say it to me then.

02:22:34.956 --> 02:22:42.883
LAURA: (whispering) Well, most of the half-orcs
I've seen have bigger tusks. (loudly) It's okay,

02:22:42.883 --> 02:22:46.852
Fjord, if you don't have a big tusk! It's not a
big deal!

02:22:46.852 --> 02:22:47.955
MARISHA: Oh, big tusks.

02:22:47.955 --> 02:22:49.897
LAURA: It's totally fine!

02:22:49.897 --> 02:22:54.053
TRAVIS: Thank you, Jester. I appreciate--

02:22:54.053 --> 02:23:00.052
SAM: Is that an indication of other body parts? Do
you have anything there? Do you have nubs? What

02:23:00.052 --> 02:23:00.892
are those?

02:23:00.892 --> 02:23:05.096
LIAM: Why don't you pull down your lower lip and
show us what's going on in there, Fjord?

02:23:05.096 --> 02:23:07.008
TRAVIS: Yup, I pull down my lower lip.

02:23:07.666 --> 02:23:08.698
SAM: What do we see?

02:23:08.698 --> 02:23:09.587
MARISHA: Does he have a cool lip tattoo?

02:23:09.587 --> 02:23:18.215
TRAVIS: You see very short, nubby teeth, with
scratches and divots and chips on the top.

02:23:18.215 --> 02:23:19.404
SAM: On all of the teeth?

02:23:19.404 --> 02:23:20.355
TRAVIS: Just on the--

02:23:20.355 --> 02:23:22.289
LAURA: (sympathetic) Just on the tusks!

02:23:22.289 --> 02:23:29.477
SAM: You had said that you did your own dental
work at one point. Did you do that? On purpose?

02:23:29.477 --> 02:23:32.394
TRAVIS: Yeah. I did.

02:23:32.394 --> 02:23:33.186
SAM: Why?

02:23:33.186 --> 02:23:36.656
MARISHA: Couldn't afford a root canal?

02:23:36.656 --> 02:23:47.139
TRAVIS: That would have been a better excuse. When
I was younger, they used to make fun of my teeth.

02:23:47.139 --> 02:23:48.694
LAURA: Who?

02:23:48.694 --> 02:23:56.379
TRAVIS: Kids can be cruel so I decided to take
away the target that was most easily available for them.

02:23:56.379 --> 02:24:01.566
LIAM: Did you grow up with people who did not have
tusks like you? So you were different?

02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:12.641
TRAVIS: Yeah, at the time there weren't any others
like me. I feel like I was especially picked on

02:24:12.641 --> 02:24:14.920
for my teeth.

02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:16.057
LIAM: Insight check.

02:24:16.057 --> 02:24:19.650
(laughter)

02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:20.456
SAM: Jesus.

02:24:20.456 --> 02:24:22.986
MARISHA: My childhood damage-- <i>Insight check</i>!

02:24:22.986 --> 02:24:25.544
LIAM: Just a ten, not great.

02:24:25.544 --> 02:24:29.469
MATT: As a note, generally you can say "do I
believe him?" and I'll tell you to make an insight

02:24:29.469 --> 02:24:32.434
check. It's not "I'm going to use an Insight Check
action!"

02:24:32.434 --> 02:24:34.429
SAM: But insight check is so much dickisher.

02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:42.291
LAURA: It really is. Do you still feel the same
way about your teeth?

02:24:42.291 --> 02:24:49.112
TRAVIS: Not necessarily. It became a habit.

02:24:49.112 --> 02:24:52.013
LAURA: You have to continue to do it?

02:24:52.013 --> 02:24:58.778
TRAVIS: I'm sure I don't have to. It's like people
who chew their nails, I guess.

02:24:58.778 --> 02:25:03.351
ASHLEY: They will always grow back, even if
you--?

02:25:03.351 --> 02:25:06.926
TRAVIS: They are persistent.

02:25:06.926 --> 02:25:08.929
LIAM: How quickly do they come back?

02:25:08.929 --> 02:25:10.658
TRAVIS: Not super fast.

02:25:10.658 --> 02:25:16.373
LAURA: Is that why you have blood on your mouth?
Were you filing your teeth last night?

02:25:16.373 --> 02:25:21.021
TRAVIS: No. I think I bit my lip.

02:25:21.021 --> 02:25:24.205
MARISHA: I hate it when that happens.

02:25:24.205 --> 02:25:27.529
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, and then you bite it again
the next day.

02:25:27.529 --> 02:25:30.464
TALIESIN: Do I believe him?

02:25:30.464 --> 02:25:33.164
MATT: You can make an insight check.

02:25:35.704 --> 02:25:36.235
TALIESIN: One.

02:25:36.235 --> 02:25:39.119
MARISHA: 800?

02:25:39.119 --> 02:25:40.005
LAURA: Is that nine?

02:25:40.005 --> 02:25:42.497
MARISHA: It's nine? It's 1,000?

02:25:42.497 --> 02:25:43.730
LAURA: No way!

02:25:43.730 --> 02:25:45.665
TALIESIN: I'm rolling so well.

02:25:45.665 --> 02:25:50.521
SAM: Did you do any other bod mod to yourself
growing up?

02:25:50.521 --> 02:25:54.544
TRAVIS: Bod mod? No, I did not.

02:25:54.544 --> 02:25:58.520
ASHLEY: Did you kill any of the children that made
fun of you?

02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:00.596
MARISHA: Children are assholes.

02:26:00.596 --> 02:26:06.078
TRAVIS: No. I didn't have that sort of a streak in
me then.

02:26:06.078 --> 02:26:09.912
SAM: Yasha, did you kill any of your fellow
children growing up?

02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:15.989
ASHLEY: If you have to go to battle, if you have a
challenge, you kill somebody.

02:26:15.989 --> 02:26:19.575
TALIESIN: If you kill them, then they're not
really your friends, are they?

02:26:19.575 --> 02:26:20.033
SAM: No.

02:26:20.033 --> 02:26:20.678
TALIESIN: Exactly.

02:26:20.678 --> 02:26:26.494
TRAVIS: I was a bit tougher than most of the other
kids. I felt like I could take the physical

02:26:26.494 --> 02:26:31.281
poking, but the jeering, I--

02:26:31.281 --> 02:26:34.672
LAURA: The emotional poking was too much!

02:26:34.672 --> 02:26:42.676
LIAM: This is many years later, though. I can't
imagine that any of us would even blink at tusks.

02:26:42.676 --> 02:26:48.114
TRAVIS: You know, it's not even really that
intentional. I'll find myself picking at them

02:26:48.114 --> 02:26:49.773
every once in a while.

02:26:49.773 --> 02:26:52.052
ASHLEY: Do you ever want them to stay there?

02:26:52.052 --> 02:26:54.810
TRAVIS: Like to grow back?

02:26:54.810 --> 02:26:56.299
LIAM and ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:26:56.299 --> 02:27:06.510
TRAVIS: Yeah, there are times. I've seen them:
other half orcs with the teeth.

02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:08.833
LAURA: The guy in Tusk Love had them.

02:27:08.833 --> 02:27:20.247
TRAVIS: He did, yeah. I feel like it's a trait
that exemplifies the rougher side of my race, so

02:27:20.247 --> 02:27:25.000
sometimes I wish I had them, and sometimes I'm
glad I don't.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:36.337
LIAM: Yeah, well you know for many of us, our
early days are always with us. I understand.

02:27:36.337 --> 02:27:40.430
SAM: This is how you see yourself, right?

02:27:40.430 --> 02:27:45.022
TRAVIS: I think it's how I'd like to see myself.

02:27:45.022 --> 02:27:48.494
MARISHA: I mean, it's how we see you.

02:27:48.494 --> 02:27:52.399
LAURA: I think you would look fine either way,
Fjord.

02:27:52.399 --> 02:27:57.085
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean we're too distracted with
our own personal damage.

02:27:57.085 --> 02:28:00.193
TRAVIS: You saying I should let them grow out?

02:28:00.193 --> 02:28:06.195
LAURA: I'm saying if you want to, you would look
good that way as well. You look good this way, you

02:28:06.195 --> 02:28:07.860
would look good that way.

02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:09.399
LIAM: Co-signed.

02:28:09.399 --> 02:28:16.518
TRAVIS: All right, fair. How about, you see me
picking at them, or chipping at them or any of

02:28:16.518 --> 02:28:19.815
that shit, you just say the word and I'll stop.

02:28:19.815 --> 02:28:23.217
LAURA and TRAVIS: Okay.

02:28:30.487 --> 02:28:36.275
MATT: The wind blows through the distant tunnels
above, and for a minute you all shiver as the cold

02:28:36.275 --> 02:28:41.092
wind finds its way down below. Except for you,
you're fine.

02:28:41.092 --> 02:28:44.631
LAURA: I'm good. Warm blooded.

02:28:44.631 --> 02:28:49.534
SAM: Should we go back to The Gentleman?

02:28:49.534 --> 02:28:52.574
TALIESIN: It's probably time.

02:28:52.574 --> 02:28:57.410
LIAM: So cloak on your back. Sword on the cloak.

02:28:57.410 --> 02:28:59.467
LAURA: Nott on the sword.

02:28:59.467 --> 02:29:01.876
SAM: Yeah, but we don't have to do that now! We
have a whole boat trip to go.

02:29:02.156 --> 02:29:03.143
LAURA: (singing) Sword up the butt!

02:29:03.143 --> 02:29:03.713
SAM: No!

02:29:03.713 --> 02:29:05.027
LAURA: (singing) Yep, straight up.

02:29:05.027 --> 02:29:06.208
SAM: Absolutely not.

02:29:06.208 --> 02:29:07.334
LAURA: (singing) Just like a puppet!

02:29:07.334 --> 02:29:07.888
SAM: No.

02:29:07.888 --> 02:29:12.684
ASHLEY: Is this a bad-- should I stay outside or
something?

02:29:12.684 --> 02:29:20.850
LIAM: There is no. We are going on. We are going
right through their territory.

02:29:20.850 --> 02:29:23.194
LAURA: If he notices it, then he notices it, if he
doesn't, then he doesn't.

02:29:23.194 --> 02:29:27.794
MARISHA: Then we bribe him with the information on
the teleportation circle.

02:29:27.794 --> 02:29:29.981
ASHLEY: Or he can challenge me, and I can, you
know.

02:29:29.981 --> 02:29:33.069
LIAM: We are a very convincing group, I think we
can talk our way through that.

02:29:33.069 --> 02:29:34.958
LAURA: I'm really good at lying.

02:29:34.958 --> 02:29:44.477
LIAM: You have your ways. Well, the morning is
getting on, shall we?

02:29:44.477 --> 02:29:46.261
LAURA: Let's get in the boats.

02:29:46.261 --> 02:29:49.459
LIAM: Hans and Franz, will you please muscle us up
this stream?

02:29:49.459 --> 02:29:52.678
MATT: Are you guys taking the same boat
arrangements?

02:29:52.678 --> 02:29:53.459
MARISHA: Sure.

02:29:53.459 --> 02:29:54.787
ASHLEY: Hans and Franz?

02:29:54.787 --> 02:30:00.014
MATT: The two of you are helming it. You know the
time of day, even though you are below the

02:30:00.014 --> 02:30:05.175
surface, keeping tracking of this because of your
feat. It's roughly six in the morning. It's very

02:30:05.175 --> 02:30:10.509
early because you guys went to bed fairly early.
You guys begin to make your way up the river now,

02:30:10.509 --> 02:30:17.814
going against the current, muscling your way up
and up further and further still. You come across

02:30:17.814 --> 02:30:22.998
the area where you had the initial confrontation
with the darkmantles and begin to push and push.

02:30:22.998 --> 02:30:25.280
LAURA: Harder because there're things there.

02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:27.139
MATT: Make a strength check, both of you guys.

02:30:27.139 --> 02:30:30.241
TRAVIS: Yeah. Eyes on the ceiling as well because
that's where danger came from.

02:30:30.241 --> 02:30:32.871
LAURA: Yeah. Eyes on the side where the rock guys
were.

02:30:32.871 --> 02:30:33.635
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:30:33.635 --> 02:30:35.508
LAURA: Oh no.

02:30:35.508 --> 02:30:37.814
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:30:37.814 --> 02:30:40.747
ASHLEY: I got 20. Not a natural.

02:30:40.747 --> 02:30:43.340
LAURA: She rolled well. This a strength check?

02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:43.881
MATT: Yes.

02:30:43.881 --> 02:30:44.907
LAURA: Five!

02:30:44.907 --> 02:30:53.604
MATT: All right. As you guys continue to go
forward, Yasha pushes on, manages to gain ground.

02:30:53.604 --> 02:30:59.051
Jester, while doing fine yesterday, trying to do
the advanced pushes, you're still making it up the

02:30:59.051 --> 02:31:02.387
stream, but you're still a little sore from the
night before.

02:31:02.387 --> 02:31:04.366
MARISHA: She did rowing yesterday.

02:31:04.366 --> 02:31:12.277
MATT: Yeah. However, you're not making any loud
noises at the moment. As you glance up, none of

02:31:12.536 --> 02:31:16.358
the darkmantles-- you look up and you can see now
there are a few that are adhered to the ceiling,

02:31:16.358 --> 02:31:22.459
but they don't seem to have noticed your presence
yet. As you're rowing through, you're falling

02:31:22.459 --> 02:31:26.900
behind. You manage to get through unnoticed and
actually way above the one boat. I need all the

02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:34.649
rest of you to make stealth checks. She's not on
your boat, which would be Jester, Beau, Molly.

02:31:34.649 --> 02:31:38.760
LAURA: Oh, Blessing of the Trickster, sure. On
you.

02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:46.326
LIAM: It feels so weird, still, with stealth
checks, to only be able to add a one when I used

02:31:46.326 --> 02:31:47.563
to add 9,000.

02:31:47.563 --> 02:31:48.173
MATT: I know.

02:31:48.173 --> 02:31:49.697
LIAM: Still feels weird.

02:31:49.697 --> 02:31:51.040
LAURA: You get advantage.

02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:56.134
TRAVIS: Hey, that's way better! Thank you. A 17.

02:31:56.134 --> 02:31:56.965
MARISHA: 24.

02:31:56.965 --> 02:31:58.388
LAURA: 12.

02:31:58.388 --> 02:31:59.316
TALIESIN: 21.

02:31:59.316 --> 02:32:02.038
LAURA: To be fair, I am rowing.

02:32:02.038 --> 02:32:09.434
MATT: As you begin to row past to continue, quiet
as you can, and with sound of the oars, it matches

02:32:09.434 --> 02:32:16.562
the slow-- it's a little bit of volume based on
the river flow, but it doesn't seem to cause

02:32:16.562 --> 02:32:22.116
enough of a ruckus to draw the attention of the
darkmantles above and the two earthen-based stone

02:32:22.116 --> 02:32:26.857
and vine creatures that you had originally seen
emerge don't seem to notice your presence as you

02:32:26.857 --> 02:32:31.909
slowly make your way past this part of the tunnel,
eventually, catching up or at least a little bit

02:32:31.909 --> 02:32:36.737
behind Yasha and their group. As you continue
forward, I need both of the boat rowers to make a

02:32:36.737 --> 02:32:37.848
constitution check, please.

02:32:37.848 --> 02:32:38.629
TRAVIS: Boat rowers!

02:32:38.629 --> 02:32:39.811
LIAM: Are we past those statues?

02:32:39.811 --> 02:32:40.972
LAURA: (exaggerated Southern accent) I'm rowing a boat!

02:32:40.972 --> 02:32:42.539
LIAM: Slowly by.

02:32:43.709 --> 02:32:45.043
LAURA: (exaggerated Southern accent) That's a 13.

02:32:45.043 --> 02:32:47.843
MATT: Yasha, constitution check please.

02:32:47.843 --> 02:32:50.410
ASHLEY: Uh oh.

02:32:54.280 --> 02:32:56.081
LIAM: Don't you have the heart of an ox?

02:32:56.081 --> 02:32:57.230
ASHLEY: A seven.

02:32:57.230 --> 02:33:02.984
MATT: A seven. You gain a point of exhaustion.
Going against the stream in itself and pushing up

02:33:02.984 --> 02:33:06.491
and with the extended push of your muscles to get
through that last bit, it's beginning to take its

02:33:06.491 --> 02:33:08.753
toll on you and your muscles being to seize up.

02:33:08.753 --> 02:33:12.356
LAURA: It's because you went so fast through the
other area. You have to pace yourself.

02:33:13.239 --> 02:33:19.243
MATT: You gain a point of exhaustion. With that
last bit, you guys manage to make your way up the

02:33:19.243 --> 02:33:23.834
rest of this underground river. It takes a little
while, but eventually you see ahead the dull green

02:33:23.834 --> 02:33:30.095
glow of the various small lanterns that were
affixed to the interior of the river cavern

02:33:30.095 --> 02:33:35.487
entrance and there you can see the docks on the
side. As you approach, waiting for you, sitting in

02:33:35.487 --> 02:33:41.863
the same position up there, that older,
crusty-looking fella named Rodel, who you had met

02:33:41.863 --> 02:33:45.632
on the way out, and Kara, leaning against the back
wall.

02:33:45.632 --> 02:33:45.999
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:33:45.999 --> 02:33:53.321
MATT: Looks like she's asleep in the corner,
sitting in a small chair and not--

02:33:53.321 --> 02:33:55.304
TRAVIS: (whistles)

02:33:55.304 --> 02:34:02.469
MATT: "Oh! Oh, you've returned. Rodel!" He wakes
up. (grunts) They eventually get over there and

02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:06.451
help you get the boats over there. They tie off
the ropes and you guys make your way up out of the

02:34:06.451 --> 02:34:15.254
water, out of the boats, and onto the dockside.
She goes, "You've returned! I see that you aren't

02:34:15.254 --> 02:34:18.932
any worse for wear. How did it go?"

02:34:18.932 --> 02:34:22.597
LAURA: We killed stuff! We are really badass!

02:34:22.597 --> 02:34:25.565
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was not really much of a test for
us.

02:34:26.007 --> 02:34:27.363
TALIESIN: There was a lot in there, though.

02:34:27.363 --> 02:34:28.106
TRAVIS: That's true.

02:34:28.106 --> 02:34:32.494
MARISHA: So many undead blobs. Lot of undead
blobs.

02:34:32.494 --> 02:34:37.080
MATT: "Fair enough. Well, let's get you back there
and talk to the boss, if he's awake. He should

02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:40.757
be." She pulls out the blindfolds again, passes
them out.

02:34:40.757 --> 02:34:44.767
TRAVIS: Can we just, forego those? I feel like
this is going to be the beginning of a very

02:34:44.767 --> 02:34:46.517
fruitful relationship, surely.

02:34:46.517 --> 02:34:49.322
MATT: "I understand that, but this is the boss's
orders. I'm sorry."

02:34:49.322 --> 02:34:52.292
MARISHA: The boss is still asleep, you said.

02:34:52.292 --> 02:34:55.001
LAURA: No, she said he was probably awake.

02:34:55.001 --> 02:34:59.477
MATT: "I don't think you understand. It's the
boss's orders. I can't just go against them."

02:34:59.717 --> 02:35:01.886
MARISHA: All right. Let's go be blindfolded.

02:35:01.886 --> 02:35:04.562
LIAM: We don't want to rock the boat here, by all
means.

02:35:04.562 --> 02:35:10.660
MATT: "Thank you. Please." She passes out
blindfolds to you guys. You figure out an order of

02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:17.584
making your way down and as you made your way to
this portion of the cavern, you walk back, being

02:35:17.584 --> 02:35:20.173
lead by Kara through the Underworks.

02:35:20.173 --> 02:35:23.012
LIAM: Do I see anything of note through Frumpkin's
eyes as we walk?

02:35:23.012 --> 02:35:27.081
MATT: Same path as you went last time, not as
busy. Nobody else is walking through the halls.

02:35:27.081 --> 02:35:30.774
It's early enough where there isn't much. You do
come past that chamber before where you saw the

02:35:30.774 --> 02:35:39.549
cages in there and there's two more cages set
inside, even larger. One of them is a heavy meshed

02:35:39.549 --> 02:35:45.007
series of metal. You don't hear anything in
there.

02:35:45.007 --> 02:35:46.683
LIAM: Can I tell what's inside there?

02:35:46.683 --> 02:35:48.465
MATT: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

02:35:48.465 --> 02:35:49.631
LIAM: Come on, Frumpkin.

02:35:49.631 --> 02:35:51.237
MATT: With disadvantage.

02:35:51.237 --> 02:35:52.200
LIAM: Doesn't matter.

02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:53.481
MARISHA: That's pretty bad.

02:35:53.481 --> 02:35:58.628
LIAM: Pretty bad. Yeah, both bad. Real low. Five.

02:35:58.628 --> 02:36:02.832
MATT: You do not, unfortunately. It's too dark in
the distance at this point. It's too late.

02:36:02.832 --> 02:36:11.828
Eventually making your way up through a series of
steps to a ladder and then you all can take your

02:36:11.828 --> 02:36:19.809
blindfolds off. You recall being led down to this
chamber. At this point, Kara says, "We're almost

02:36:19.809 --> 02:36:24.707
there." She climbs up the ladder and opens a trap
door that leads into a small chamber. You guys

02:36:24.707 --> 02:36:33.020
follow her up inside a storage room where there
are sacks of food and barrels of all sorts of

02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:39.235
alcohol, ale, water, and whatever else materials
are being kept down here. Going through a door not

02:36:39.235 --> 02:36:45.720
but two feet from that open hatch into the
familiar interior of the true Evening Nip tavern.

02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:54.959
SAM: Before we go in, I'm going to try to tug on
Yasha's leg. Don't you want to carry me? My legs

02:36:54.959 --> 02:36:56.992
are a little achy.

02:36:56.992 --> 02:36:58.325
ASHLEY: Oh, yes.

02:37:01.705 --> 02:37:02.820
MARISHA: By the scruff.

02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:04.614
TRAVIS: Right up the butt.

02:37:04.614 --> 02:37:06.903
SAM: Ah! I try to find a position.

02:37:06.903 --> 02:37:10.474
ASHLEY: Try to settle the cloak to--

02:37:10.734 --> 02:37:19.839
MATT: Did you leave your moon sword behind? Or do
you still have it with you?

02:37:19.839 --> 02:37:24.894
ASHLEY: I still have it with me. Was I supposed to
leave it behind?

02:37:24.894 --> 02:37:30.131
MATT: No, it's up to you. Meaning, if you have the
sword that you had in the sheath that the moon

02:37:30.131 --> 02:37:33.235
sword was in right now, or at least tucked in
there briefly because it's a little wider than the

02:37:33.235 --> 02:37:39.038
sword you had previously had so it's going to
carve through. It'll hold, it but the scabbard's probably--

02:37:39.038 --> 02:37:42.746
ASHLEY: I want to keep it so maybe we can sell the
Moon-Touched Sword. Could we have put it in the--

02:37:42.746 --> 02:37:44.603
TALIESIN: We could have strapped them both to your
back.

02:37:44.603 --> 02:37:47.113
LAURA: Well the Moon-touched Sword, is it small
enough to fit in the bag or is it--?

02:37:47.113 --> 02:37:49.802
MATT: Barely. Just barely. I'd say you can
probably get that in there.

02:37:49.802 --> 02:37:51.915
ASHLEY: Sorry. I totally forgot about that.

02:37:51.915 --> 02:37:57.360
MATT: Just making sure we knew about that. As you
enter the chamber, the light is lower. It looks

02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:04.261
like only three of the interior torches are
currently glowing. There is no barkeep at the bar

02:38:04.261 --> 02:38:08.701
and there are no patrons in there. The ogre
guard is there in the corner. Looks a little

02:38:08.889 --> 02:38:15.880
groggy and recently come to consciousness and is
feasting on a whole side of pig that has been

02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:21.455
cured and salted. It hasn't been butchered,
literally tearing off the bone of the half of the

02:38:21.455 --> 02:38:30.048
pig and sees you enter and (grunts) and continues
eating. On the balcony across the way, as soon as

02:38:30.048 --> 02:38:35.195
you enter, you can see at the top, there is the
female goliath, Sorah, who is standing there and

02:38:35.195 --> 02:38:46.022
looking down at you as you enter and gives a head
nod of acknowledgement. Kara goes, "Sorry, Sorah.

02:38:46.022 --> 02:38:57.741
Is The Gentleman awake? They've returned. Like to
talk to him, please." Sorah turns around and pulls

02:38:57.741 --> 02:39:04.202
open-- You can look behind now, what little bit of
light there is a drawn, heavy curtain that blocks

02:39:04.202 --> 02:39:13.077
the interior behind and goes, "Boss, the <i>Nein</i>
have returned." Some voices on the inside and a

02:39:13.077 --> 02:39:22.221
voice goes, "Ah. Just a moment. I'm sorry. Got
some business." Then coming out from behind the

02:39:22.221 --> 02:39:30.452
curtain, you see The Gentleman in this long deep
purple silk robe that is tied around the waist and

02:39:30.452 --> 02:39:35.213
goes, "(laughter) Well, you've returned."

02:39:35.213 --> 02:39:36.971
LAURA: (fake wolf whistles)

02:39:36.971 --> 02:39:47.204
MATT: "Indeed. Well, have a seat, please. 
(claps loudly) Some food, please."

02:39:47.204 --> 02:39:49.323
SAM: We'll stand.

02:39:49.323 --> 02:39:51.299
ASHLEY: Just lean up against the wall while.

02:39:51.299 --> 02:39:55.952
MARISHA: Bacon. I want bacon.

02:39:55.952 --> 02:40:03.191
MATT: "Bacon, please. Get these friends some
bacon! My god. I'll be right down." He goes back

02:40:03.591 --> 02:40:09.361
into the chamber. You hear some other voices and a
slight giggle and then Sorah enters the chamber

02:40:09.361 --> 02:40:16.227
after him. A few moments pass and then one of the
doors on the bottom area opens up and Sorah steps

02:40:16.227 --> 02:40:22.664
out, holds the door aside and The Gentleman, who's
still in his robe but now has pants and boots on,

02:40:22.664 --> 02:40:32.747
enters the chamber and goes, "(laughter) Well,
early risers. I'm not going to lie, we were sad to

02:40:32.747 --> 02:40:38.269
see you not return sooner and had assumed that
perhaps you had not survived so this is a great,

02:40:38.269 --> 02:40:45.886
gracious celebration of your return." He goes and
sits down behind his usual chair.

02:40:45.886 --> 02:40:51.504
TRAVIS: Apologies for our poor timing. Hopefully
we weren't interrupting?

02:40:51.504 --> 02:40:54.197
LAURA: Early in the morning.

02:40:54.197 --> 02:41:05.129
MATT: "What? Was having breakfast. Anyway. You're
alive, a little worse for wear. I see some scuffs

02:41:05.129 --> 02:41:10.001
around the edges. Tell me all about it. What did
you do?"

02:41:10.001 --> 02:41:15.821
TRAVIS: Really not that big of a deal. There were
some will-o'-wisps, some floating spirits.

02:41:15.821 --> 02:41:17.059
TALIESIN: Quite a few will-o'-wisps.

02:41:17.059 --> 02:41:23.289
LAURA: Yeah, so many will-o'-wisps. Did you know
you just have to break a vase and you kill a will-o'-wisp?

02:41:23.289 --> 02:41:25.069
MATT: "I did not but good to know."

02:41:25.069 --> 02:41:29.128
MARISHA: There's like ash all over the place now.
Sorry about that.

02:41:29.531 --> 02:41:30.635
TALIESIN: Quite a few traps.

02:41:30.635 --> 02:41:31.370
MATT: "Right."

02:41:31.370 --> 02:41:33.435
TALIESIN: Was there a gelatinous cube at one
point?

02:41:33.435 --> 02:41:34.614
TRAVIS: There was, actually, yes.

02:41:34.614 --> 02:41:39.403
LAURA: Yeah, this big cube came down from the
ceiling and it tried to eat us.

02:41:39.403 --> 02:41:41.036
MATT: "That's terrifying."

02:41:41.036 --> 02:41:41.823
TRAVIS: Indeed.

02:41:41.823 --> 02:41:42.883
LAURA: It's pretty scary.

02:41:42.883 --> 02:41:46.715
TRAVIS: Good thing you sent the pros. Amateurs
probably would have had a worse time.

02:41:46.715 --> 02:41:48.686
MARISHA: Found lots of skeletons along the way.

02:41:48.686 --> 02:41:50.014
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah.

02:41:50.014 --> 02:41:52.423
SAM: And exactly six rings for you.

02:41:52.423 --> 02:41:55.488
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:41:55.488 --> 02:41:57.530
(laughter)

02:41:57.530 --> 02:41:59.702
TRAVIS: You are not Scanlan anymore!

02:41:59.702 --> 02:42:02.433
(laughter)

02:42:02.433 --> 02:42:03.461
SAM: Nine.

02:42:03.461 --> 02:42:08.962
MATT: "(chuckles) Really?"

02:42:08.962 --> 02:42:11.228
TALIESIN: I smack her on the back of the head.

02:42:11.228 --> 02:42:12.427
SAM: You can't reach.

02:42:12.427 --> 02:42:17.053
TALIESIN: That's right! You're up. I swat.

02:42:17.053 --> 02:42:20.012
TRAVIS: There was a fair amount of jewelry. There
was.

02:42:20.012 --> 02:42:23.499
MARISHA: We also found a decent amount of fine art
for you.

02:42:23.499 --> 02:42:28.671
LAURA: Oh yes! I pull out the vases. Look at these
antiques!

02:42:28.671 --> 02:42:31.403
MATT: He pulls one out. Inspects it.

02:42:31.403 --> 02:42:33.168
LAURA: Careful, they're very old.

02:42:33.168 --> 02:42:41.477
MATT: "Of course. I'm a collector myself. It's
fine. This is beautiful make. This is

02:42:41.477 --> 02:42:46.193
pre-Divergence as well. (chuckles)."

02:42:46.193 --> 02:42:48.507
LAURA: I bet they're worth a whole of money then,
huh?

02:42:48.507 --> 02:42:51.905
MATT: "Oh, most certainly! To the right people,
they can be worth quite a bit."

02:42:51.905 --> 02:42:53.670
LAURA: We found some candlesticks too.

02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:54.495
ASHLEY: Also some candlesticks.

02:42:54.495 --> 02:42:59.849
MATT: "All right." You produce the candelabra.
"These <i>six</i> rings, you say."

02:42:59.849 --> 02:43:04.124
LAURA: It was seven. I give one of the extra
rings.

02:43:04.124 --> 02:43:06.327
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:43:06.327 --> 02:43:10.166
MARISHA: Come on, Jester.

02:43:10.166 --> 02:43:13.883
ASHLEY: I didn't keep mine.

02:43:13.883 --> 02:43:16.133
LAURA: Yeah, I know.

02:43:16.133 --> 02:43:18.784
TRAVIS: Look, we know who has them. We know.

02:43:18.784 --> 02:43:20.675
LAURA: 16?

02:43:20.675 --> 02:43:29.947
MATT: He goes, "Well, thank you for your honesty.
Anything else?" He gives a very intense look

02:43:29.947 --> 02:43:37.618
across each of your faces. "You would like to
inform me that you found, encountered, any

02:43:37.618 --> 02:43:43.383
warnings? We're going back in after there to clear
out whatever remains behind so we want to make

02:43:43.383 --> 02:43:44.518
sure we're prepared."

02:43:44.518 --> 02:43:46.271
LAURA: I think we killed everything.

02:43:46.271 --> 02:43:50.578
LIAM: No, you don't want to get pantsed. We did
not kill everything entirely. There are some

02:43:50.578 --> 02:43:56.133
critters on the roof of the river passage. Nothing
major, you just want to have your eyes on the

02:43:56.133 --> 02:43:57.387
ceiling as you go through.

02:43:57.387 --> 02:43:58.608
MATT: "Of course. We know of that."

02:43:58.608 --> 02:44:05.246
LAURA: We see two rock creatures that were really
big but they're really slow so bolt on past them

02:44:05.246 --> 02:44:06.920
and they won't be able to catch you.

02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:09.050
MATT: "Right, but within this facility itself?"

02:44:09.050 --> 02:44:13.208
TRAVIS: There was a destroyed-- looks like a
transportation circle inside.

02:44:13.208 --> 02:44:17.978
LIAM: Yes. To be honest, it looks like it was
possibly looted some time long ago.

02:44:17.978 --> 02:44:19.375
MARISHA: There wasn't a lot left.

02:44:19.375 --> 02:44:25.044
LIAM: Whatever has inhabited the place in recent
years or in recent centuries has been removed.

02:44:25.044 --> 02:44:27.362
LAURA: There were a lot of burned books.

02:44:27.362 --> 02:44:29.732
TRAVIS: Bodies. Lots of bodies.

02:44:29.732 --> 02:44:33.198
SAM: Traps, which I deftly dismantled.

02:44:33.198 --> 02:44:37.715
LAURA: Mostly be careful walking on them. You'll
see them.

02:44:37.715 --> 02:44:40.428
SAM: Pressure plates in the lower floor.

02:44:40.428 --> 02:44:41.814
LAURA: They're pretty obvious now.

02:44:41.814 --> 02:44:45.363
MATT: At this point, food begins to be brought
from the far kitchen. You can see the person who

02:44:45.363 --> 02:44:49.383
had just woken up has been rushing to make
whatever meats are available and has been cooking.

02:44:49.383 --> 02:44:53.609
The smell begins to permeate and it's coming out
piecemeal, as they're ready.

02:44:53.609 --> 02:44:58.780
TALIESIN: Once we've figured out that the
will-o'-wisps were coming from pots we just broke

02:44:58.780 --> 02:45:01.209
anything that looked like it might contain one.

02:45:01.209 --> 02:45:07.132
MATT: "All right. Is that all? I would like to
specify that I despise falsehood, and our

02:45:07.132 --> 02:45:10.549
relationship is based on honesty and trust."

02:45:10.549 --> 02:45:18.671
LAURA: Well, there were two paths in the river,
and the second path lead to a waterfall. I don't

02:45:18.671 --> 02:45:24.209
know what was at the top of the waterfall. There
could be a chamber up there. I don't know. The

02:45:24.209 --> 02:45:26.514
other side lead to the thing.

02:45:26.514 --> 02:45:31.187
TALIESIN: A lot of images on the wall. Weird magic
stuff.

02:45:31.187 --> 02:45:39.010
MARISHA: Oh! There was this floor with this relief
in it of these two faces, and Fjord put some coins

02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:45.073
in it. It opened up and he collapsed and fell in a
pit. It was super fun.

02:45:45.073 --> 02:45:47.208
MATT: "What was in the pit?"

02:45:47.208 --> 02:45:48.670
TRAVIS: A lot of bodies.

02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:52.898
MATT: "Anything else?"

02:45:52.898 --> 02:45:58.124
ASHLEY: Probably the two leftover coins that he
put in the eyeballs are still there.

02:45:58.124 --> 02:46:00.139
TRAVIS: Four, because there were two pairs.

02:46:00.139 --> 02:46:02.097
LAURA: Is there anything else?

02:46:07.707 --> 02:46:08.524
SAM: Nope.

02:46:08.524 --> 02:46:10.341
LAURA: We're the worst.

02:46:10.341 --> 02:46:14.467
TALIESIN: Possibly a probing question would remind
some things. I'm trying to remember. It was a bit daunting.

02:46:15.164 --> 02:46:16.853
TRAVIS: Yeah. So tired.

02:46:16.853 --> 02:46:19.245
MATT: "So there was nothing else?"

02:46:19.245 --> 02:46:23.136
MARISHA: No, we stayed up all night trying to get
back here.

02:46:23.136 --> 02:46:25.701
LAURA: We almost died.

02:46:26.111 --> 02:46:29.518
MATT: "Is that all you found and recovered?"

02:46:29.518 --> 02:46:33.328
LAURA: (mumbling) I could look in my bag.

02:46:33.328 --> 02:46:40.481
MATT: He's done business before and is looking
very intently across all of your faces.

02:46:43.461 --> 02:46:44.602
TRAVIS: I start eating.

02:46:44.602 --> 02:46:51.239
MATT: "You're dodging my question. That doesn't
make me comfortable. That doesn't make me trust you."

02:46:51.704 --> 02:46:53.854
MARISHA: There's just no answer further.

02:46:53.854 --> 02:46:57.665
MATT: "You're telling me that's all you found?"

02:46:57.665 --> 02:47:02.786
ASHLEY: What were you looking for, anyway?

02:47:02.786 --> 02:47:06.753
MATT: "Nothing. I wish to be informed that that is
the end of your recovery."

02:47:06.753 --> 02:47:15.051
MARISHA: You knew going in here it was heavily
looted and raided. We brought you several pieces--

02:47:15.051 --> 02:47:21.510
MATT: "I'm going to go out on a limb here and
inform you that, as much as you try to doublespeak

02:47:21.510 --> 02:47:23.732
me, that I've been a master far longer than you
have."

02:47:23.732 --> 02:47:25.540
LIAM: Give him the book.

02:47:29.490 --> 02:47:31.318
MARISHA: (sigh) Caleb, we talked about this.

02:47:31.318 --> 02:47:34.934
LIAM: Yeah, and we said that we'd give him the
book, so I'm a little confused.

02:47:34.934 --> 02:47:35.501
ASHLEY: No!

02:47:41.461 --> 02:47:49.775
MARISHA: All right, man. Been in the business
longer than we have. I toss him the research notebook.

02:47:49.775 --> 02:47:50.776
MATT: He catches it.

02:47:50.776 --> 02:47:54.886
MARISHA: Here's the precious research you were
looking for.

02:47:54.886 --> 02:47:56.532
MATT: "All right. Thank you."

02:47:56.532 --> 02:47:57.869
MARISHA: You're welcome.

02:47:57.869 --> 02:47:58.984
MATT: "Is that all of it?"

02:47:58.984 --> 02:47:59.702
MARISHA: Yes.

02:47:59.702 --> 02:48:01.500
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:05.688
MARISHA: Fuck! Who, just me? Can he help me?

02:48:05.688 --> 02:48:11.761
LIAM: I said no at the same time. Can she aid me?

02:48:12.741 --> 02:48:16.279
MATT: I'll say sure. I'll give you advantage on
this. Because you both--

02:48:16.279 --> 02:48:18.082
LIAM: I have very good charisma.

02:48:18.082 --> 02:48:18.948
MATT: She's rolling.

02:48:18.948 --> 02:48:27.537
MARISHA: Natural 20. Thank you! Yeah!
Motherfucking liars!

02:48:27.537 --> 02:48:34.444
SAM: Unfortunately, we have to take $100 away from
826LA.

02:48:34.921 --> 02:48:36.607
(laughter)

02:48:36.607 --> 02:48:39.972
SAM: I'm sorry kids. It's really a shame.

02:48:39.972 --> 02:48:48.461
MATT: We didn't think this through. At that point,
he sits back comfortably. "Very well. Thank you so

02:48:48.461 --> 02:49:00.763
much. I'm impressed. I am happy. Keep the rings. I
said you can take something back with you, and

02:49:00.763 --> 02:49:10.046
you've done your job. You've proven yourselves
very trustworthy. Please, at your leisure. Take

02:49:10.046 --> 02:49:14.942
solace in knowing that your friend, Horris, is
safely on his way to Berleben."

02:49:14.942 --> 02:49:16.399
SAM: Seemingly?

02:49:16.399 --> 02:49:17.118
MATT: "Safely."

02:49:17.118 --> 02:49:19.897
LAURA: Do I believe him?

02:49:19.897 --> 02:49:21.769
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:49:21.769 --> 02:49:26.891
MARISHA: Come on. There's been one too many
"seemingly"s.

02:49:26.891 --> 02:49:29.411
LAURA: Is that an 11 or a 17?

02:49:29.411 --> 02:49:30.242
SAM: 17.

02:49:30.242 --> 02:49:34.477
LAURA: 17? 21? Yeah, that's a 17. 21!

02:49:34.477 --> 02:49:37.372
MATT: He's being completely honest.

02:49:37.372 --> 02:49:39.358
LAURA: He's being honest!

02:49:39.358 --> 02:49:45.078
TRAVIS: That's great! I appreciate you seeing him
to safety.

02:49:45.078 --> 02:49:51.437
MATT: "Of course." He snaps his fingers, and over
by the curved stairway that leads down in here,

02:49:51.437 --> 02:49:58.415
two gentlemen that were sitting there in the
shadows, unseen before, sit up. He goes, "Go on!",

02:49:58.415 --> 02:50:05.275
and they both get up and leave up the stairs. He
goes, "I've now initiated my means of getting you

02:50:05.275 --> 02:50:11.340
folks and most likely, Dolan, off the hook for the
murder of the High-Richter. It may take some time,

02:50:11.340 --> 02:50:15.567
a day or two, maybe more, but have some faith in
my abilities. Just lay low for a few days, if you

02:50:15.567 --> 02:50:16.735
don't mind."

02:50:16.735 --> 02:50:18.655
LAURA: We're really good at that.

02:50:18.655 --> 02:50:20.450
TALIESIN: We'll do our humble best.

02:50:20.450 --> 02:50:24.943
MARISHA: Will we get confirmation, word from you,
that the deed has been done?

02:50:24.943 --> 02:50:33.832
MATT: "If all goes well, you won't need it from
me. With that, I call that a bargain met on all

02:50:33.832 --> 02:50:39.345
sides. Wouldn't you?" He takes a little piece of
burnt pork off the table. "Congratulations. You

02:50:39.345 --> 02:50:48.048
have my favor, Mighty Nein." He turns to Fjord.
"If you ever need me, come find me. If I should

02:50:48.048 --> 02:50:55.652
need you, I'll find you. Now, off! I have to
finish my breakfast, and my breakfast."

02:50:58.502 --> 02:50:59.163
TRAVIS: Baller.

02:50:59.163 --> 02:51:07.039
MARISHA: I take the leftover bacon strips, and I
shove them in my pocket.

02:51:07.039 --> 02:51:12.378
LIAM: I'm disappointed that we don't have real
bacon right now!

02:51:12.378 --> 02:51:16.221
MARISHA: I give half of my bacon to Caleb. Here
you go.

02:51:16.221 --> 02:51:17.938
LIAM: But less, you need the protein.

02:51:17.938 --> 02:51:22.803
ASHLEY: Do you still keep the blood vials that
you--

02:51:22.803 --> 02:51:29.449
MATT: "Oh yes, of course. We keep those for anyone
we do business with. Sure. Standard procedure, I'm sorry."

02:51:29.762 --> 02:51:32.234
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay.

02:51:32.234 --> 02:51:40.214
SAM: It's fine, Yasha. After all, I have an empty
vial with his saliva in it, so we have that too.

02:51:45.481 --> 02:51:46.798
MATT: He just stares.

02:51:46.798 --> 02:51:51.986
TRAVIS: Thank you for your consideration and time.
We'll be in touch, shall we?

02:51:51.986 --> 02:52:03.509
MATT: "Of course. Be safe." Finishes his meal,
glaring at Nott on your way out. As you guys exit

02:52:03.509 --> 02:52:11.719
the bottom of The Evening Nip up into the proper
top of the tavern, you step out. Looking out, you

02:52:11.719 --> 02:52:17.892
can see the morning sun has risen. It's still
early morning at this point in time. It's probably

02:52:17.892 --> 02:52:20.063
eight o'clock in the morning at this point.

02:52:20.063 --> 02:52:24.881
SAM and LAURA: What a day.

02:52:24.881 --> 02:52:26.635
MARISHA: That was awesome.

02:52:26.635 --> 02:52:31.574
LAURA: We have stuff to sell!

02:52:31.574 --> 02:52:35.305
TALIESIN: Let's go pawn some things.

02:52:35.305 --> 02:52:40.161
LAURA: Should we go do that now or should we lay
low for a little bit and make sure that he doesn't

02:52:40.161 --> 02:52:42.077
have anyone following us?

02:52:42.077 --> 02:52:46.290
TRAVIS: He can follow us. That's fine.

02:52:46.290 --> 02:52:48.682
LAURA: Let's go back to The Leaky Tap.

02:52:48.682 --> 02:52:52.011
LIAM: Help me remember, DM, did we have a way to
get in contact with Dolan?

02:52:52.011 --> 02:52:56.753
MATT: Dolan was left at his home. That's the last
you saw, just him at his home.

02:52:56.753 --> 02:53:02.306
TRAVIS: That's right. You sure you don't want to
sell off any of your extra wares?

02:53:02.306 --> 02:53:04.011
TALIESIN: Let's clear some things out.

02:53:04.011 --> 02:53:07.264
LAURA: We do have some rings to sell, I guess, if
we wanted to.

02:53:07.264 --> 02:53:09.270
MARISHA: We have those chains. We could--

02:53:09.270 --> 02:53:13.029
LAURA: Did you ever look at those chains? Did you
look at the mantacles?

02:53:13.029 --> 02:53:14.730
LIAM: What mantacles?

02:53:14.730 --> 02:53:17.886
LAURA: The mantacles. To see if they were
magical.

02:53:17.886 --> 02:53:19.968
LIAM: This is the first I am hearing of the
manacles.

02:53:19.968 --> 02:53:21.780
TALIESIN: We didn't actually tell him about the
manacles.

02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:24.808
MARISHA: We found a dead guy. In chains.

02:53:24.808 --> 02:53:26.742
TALIESIN: A very dead guy.

02:53:26.742 --> 02:53:31.884
MARISHA: Do you think that people are going to
start being suspicious of us if we keep selling

02:53:31.884 --> 02:53:34.047
magical manacles?

02:53:34.047 --> 02:53:35.979
LAURA: We should probably stop going to--

02:53:35.979 --> 02:53:37.857
MARISHA: The same blacksmith?

02:53:37.857 --> 02:53:40.578
LAURA: Maybe not to Pumat Sol for a little bit.

02:53:40.578 --> 02:53:44.455
LIAM: Maybe Pumat has a competitor in a town this
big.

02:53:45.015 --> 02:53:45.945
LAURA: I'm sure.

02:53:45.945 --> 02:53:51.659
LIAM: Why don't we wait until we're back at The
Leaky Tap before I look at these manacles you

02:53:51.659 --> 02:53:58.033
have? I would, if possible, like to swing past
Dolan's house, if that's okay.

02:53:58.033 --> 02:53:58.956
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:53:58.956 --> 02:54:00.276
TALIESIN: I don't see why not.

02:54:00.276 --> 02:54:01.725
TRAVIS: Put him at ease?

02:54:01.725 --> 02:54:04.965
MARISHA: Let him know that Horris is out of town.

02:54:04.965 --> 02:54:17.178
LIAM: Yeah, and before he died, he gave me
something that I think Dolan would want to have.

02:54:17.178 --> 02:54:18.692
Ulog, before Ulog died.

02:54:18.692 --> 02:54:22.615
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah, of course. Head back that way.

02:54:22.615 --> 02:54:28.719
SAM: As we get clear of the bar, (popping) I'm
going to get down off of Yasha.

02:54:28.719 --> 02:54:31.708
(laughter)

02:54:31.708 --> 02:54:33.986
TALIESIN: You've been waiting for that for too
long.

02:54:33.986 --> 02:54:42.446
ASHLEY: It's very strange how you're very dense.

02:54:42.446 --> 02:54:45.101
SAM: It's all muscle.

02:54:45.101 --> 02:54:49.376
ASHLEY: I feel it's a lot heavier than you look.

02:54:49.376 --> 02:54:52.553
SAM: I'm a cool 45 pounds, yo!

02:54:52.553 --> 02:54:56.838
LAURA: You should probably take a bath.

02:54:56.838 --> 02:54:59.438
SAM: Yes, I guess so.

02:54:59.438 --> 02:55:04.087
LAURA: Nott, I know you don't like water, but this
is an <i>extreme version</i>.

02:55:04.087 --> 02:55:09.805
SAM: Maybe I could wipe myself clean with a dry
towel.

02:55:09.805 --> 02:55:13.695
LAURA: I think probably at least a damp towel?

02:55:13.695 --> 02:55:19.215
LIAM: This is surprising coming from me, but I
agree with that sentiment. You are covered in dead person.

02:55:19.519 --> 02:55:20.674
TALIESIN: Several.

02:55:20.674 --> 02:55:22.442
MARISHA: Several dead people.

02:55:22.442 --> 02:55:24.079
TALIESIN: Specifically their feet.

02:55:27.509 --> 02:55:30.750
SAM: Okay, I'll think about it.

02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:42.259
MATT: As you guys begin to walk along the streets
of Zadash here in the morning air, the cloud cover

02:55:42.267 --> 02:55:49.393
in the sky still gray, sunless, cool. You can see
the mist of the town is now finally burning off,

02:55:49.393 --> 02:55:56.983
but the gray day is still cool and welcoming.
You're going to Dolan's house? You make your way

02:55:56.983 --> 02:56:02.100
towards Dolan's, trying to still dodge too much
attention from the crownsguard, which

02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:02.762
thankfully--

02:56:02.762 --> 02:56:03.843
MARISHA: Especially Molly and I.

02:56:03.843 --> 02:56:08.443
MATT: Not too strong at this point. They still are
trying to prevent people from entering and

02:56:08.443 --> 02:56:12.644
exiting, but there are still patrols that go
through. You make your way carefully through, this

02:56:12.644 --> 02:56:15.664
point in the morning, towards the exterior of
Dolan's hut.

02:56:15.664 --> 02:56:20.758
MARISHA: As we're walking, I lean over to Fjord,
and I go: Something's been bothering me. The

02:56:20.758 --> 02:56:30.751
Gentleman said that it was Ulog that arranged and
leaked the information to the Xhorhasian

02:56:30.751 --> 02:56:36.683
assassins. What would be his motive for doing
that, if he only really cared about getting his

02:56:36.683 --> 02:56:40.424
wife free? Or at least revenge for his wife.

02:56:40.424 --> 02:56:46.625
TRAVIS: I think he was trying to upset the
government, right? Create fractures, hope pressure

02:56:46.625 --> 02:56:48.918
would make things snap in the end?

02:56:48.918 --> 02:56:56.156
MARISHA: I hope so. Feels like a big task for one
person. How would he have those connections?

02:56:56.156 --> 02:57:02.019
TRAVIS: Maybe he's been hedging his bets for a
while. Good to keep in mind.

02:57:02.019 --> 02:57:02.602
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:57:02.602 --> 02:57:09.322
MATT: You guys come up to the exterior of Dolan's
home. It's dark on the inside.

02:57:10.252 --> 02:57:12.295
TRAVIS: I'd normally, but I feel like he knows
you.

02:57:12.295 --> 02:57:15.409
LIAM: You come with me because you've spoken to
him more than I have.

02:57:17.469 --> 02:57:21.868
TRAVIS: Walk up. Double tap, followed by a
single.

02:57:21.868 --> 02:57:29.839
MATT: A moment passes, and the door (lock clicks,
creak). Dolan's head peeks out. "Gentlemen, it's

02:57:29.839 --> 02:57:32.301
good to see you. What news have you?"

02:57:32.301 --> 02:57:39.996
LIAM: Only a moment of your time. I'm a little
embarrassed that I did not remember this the other

02:57:39.996 --> 02:57:43.628
day, but it was quite an evening that night.

02:57:43.628 --> 02:57:45.214
MATT: "Of course."

02:57:45.214 --> 02:57:54.647
LIAM: When Ulog was in that house, he found
something that I think you should have. Shortly

02:57:54.647 --> 02:58:03.643
before he expired, he shoved it into my hand. I
pull out those papers that he found about the

02:58:03.643 --> 02:58:11.431
wife. It's a little frayed, he shoved it into my
hand. We are lucky that it did not burn up, but

02:58:11.431 --> 02:58:13.016
take this, please.

02:58:13.016 --> 02:58:19.925
MATT: "Of course. I'll see what I can do. Things
are a bit tense right now, of course."

02:58:19.925 --> 02:58:21.659
LIAM: When it makes sense.

02:58:21.659 --> 02:58:24.448
MATT: "Of course. How is Horris?"

02:58:24.448 --> 02:58:25.639
TRAVIS: Safe.

02:58:25.639 --> 02:58:26.833
LIAM: On his way.

02:58:26.833 --> 02:58:28.156
MATT: "Oh, thank god."

02:58:28.156 --> 02:58:29.511
TRAVIS: To Berleben.

02:58:29.511 --> 02:58:37.632
MATT: "To Berleben? That's far enough away, I
think, from any influence here. Thank you. Thank

02:58:37.632 --> 02:58:38.782
you so much."

02:58:38.782 --> 02:58:43.652
TRAVIS: Of course. It was the least we can do. We
trust with this information and the right things

02:58:43.652 --> 02:58:48.400
occurring in the next few days, you can find your
way to some prosperous moves for this city.

02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:51.024
MATT: "I hope so."

02:58:51.024 --> 02:58:56.263
LAIM: A lot of bad things are happening now. It
would be nice if one good thing could come of it all.

02:58:56.263 --> 02:59:01.434
MATT: "That would be. I'd like to see a turn for
the right in this city, or another, at least.

02:59:01.434 --> 02:59:06.617
There is right in this city. There are good
people. As terrible as the death of the

02:59:06.617 --> 02:59:11.370
High-Richter may be, in essence I think much good
may come out of it, in the long run."

02:59:11.370 --> 02:59:14.144
LIAM: It's entirely up to you now, isn't it?

02:59:14.144 --> 02:59:20.981
MATT: "We shall see. Anyway, you musn't be seen
dilly dallying along at this home, just in case.

02:59:20.981 --> 02:59:27.578
Thank you for the update, thank you for Horris,
and good luck, friends. I do hope we meet again

02:59:27.578 --> 02:59:29.548
soon, in better times."

02:59:29.548 --> 02:59:31.550
LIAM: <i>Tschüß.</i>

02:59:31.550 --> 02:59:36.256
MATT: Closes the door, locks it behind.

02:59:39.486 --> 02:59:40.463
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:59:40.463 --> 02:59:43.452
LIAM: Broken clock twice a day. Come on.

02:59:47.272 --> 02:59:49.178
MATT: Are you guys heading back to The Leaky Tap?

02:59:49.181 --> 02:59:50.841
LIAM: Yeah.

02:59:50.841 --> 02:59:54.799
MATT: Okay. As you head back to The Leaky Tap,
people are starting to come to consciousness and

02:59:54.799 --> 03:00:00.176
exit the building. The street becomes a little
more bustling. One of the barkers, one of the town

03:00:00.176 --> 03:00:04.696
criers that you had seen before when you arrived
begins coming down the street, and begins doing

03:00:04.696 --> 03:00:13.146
his shouts. "Harvest Close comes on the third of
Fessuran! Harvest Close comes on the third of

03:00:13.146 --> 03:00:15.295
Fessuran!" and continues walking past.

03:00:15.295 --> 03:00:21.092
MARISHA: We could enter in a contest and fight for
the Harvest Festival, right?

03:00:21.092 --> 03:00:23.831
LAURA: Oh yeah, there was something about that.

03:00:23.831 --> 03:00:26.476
TRAVIS: Really? Just for sport?

03:00:26.476 --> 03:00:29.594
MARISHA: Yeah. Maybe there's prize money or
something.

03:00:29.594 --> 03:00:32.791
TRAVIS: That could be a nice change of pace.

03:00:32.791 --> 03:00:35.478
MARISHA: I like fighting people for fun.

03:00:35.478 --> 03:00:38.484
MATT: You get closer to The Leaky Tap and see
another female--

03:00:38.484 --> 03:00:40.470
LAURA: Yeah, in the Victory Pit!

03:00:40.470 --> 03:00:42.087
MARISHA: Yeah, that's it.

03:00:42.087 --> 03:00:48.946
MATT: Another town crier comes by, younger female,
with the big tabard and the scroll as she walks by

03:00:48.946 --> 03:00:54.046
says, "Conflict at the Xhorhasian border grows
violent! Watch your children at night!"

03:00:54.046 --> 03:00:58.369
MARISHA: (singing) Hide your kids! Hide your
wife!

03:00:58.369 --> 03:01:02.815
MATT: "Conflict at the Xhorhasian border grows
violent! Watch your children at night!" She

03:01:02.815 --> 03:01:03.596
continues walking.

03:01:03.596 --> 03:01:05.080
LAURA: What happened to the children?

03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:07.407
MATT: She looks back at you, "I'm just reading the
paper."

03:01:07.407 --> 03:01:09.319
ASHLEY: May I have one of those?

03:01:09.319 --> 03:01:13.100
MATT: "It's for me to read from. I have one.
No--"

03:01:13.100 --> 03:01:20.975
ASHLEY: I'm going to look at it, and then I'm
going to give it back to you. Does it say any more?

03:01:20.975 --> 03:01:26.473
MATT: On this, it has the Xhorhasian note, and it
has the Harvest Close coming the third of

03:01:26.767 --> 03:01:29.156
Fessuran. Those are the two notes of the day.

03:01:29.156 --> 03:01:31.057
ASHLEY: You literally just-- that's all that's on
there.

03:01:31.057 --> 03:01:32.241
MATT: "That's my job."

03:01:32.241 --> 03:01:32.905
MARISHA: Hey!

03:01:32.905 --> 03:01:33.679
MATT: "Ah!"

03:01:33.679 --> 03:01:36.108
MARISHA: Where do we sign up for the Victory Pit?

03:01:36.108 --> 03:01:37.502
MATT: "I don't know."

03:01:37.502 --> 03:01:38.999
MARISHA: Tell me. You know!

03:01:38.999 --> 03:01:40.174
TRAVIS: You want to tell her.

03:01:40.174 --> 03:01:44.802
MATT: Make an intimidation check. Sure.

03:01:44.802 --> 03:01:47.611
MARISHA: We had a long-ass night.

03:01:47.611 --> 03:01:48.754
MATT: With advantage.

03:01:48.754 --> 03:01:50.218
MARISHA: With advantage?

03:01:50.218 --> 03:01:52.341
LIAM: Marisha, your theme with children
continues.

03:01:52.341 --> 03:01:55.405
MARISHA and TRAVIS: She is not a child!

03:01:55.405 --> 03:02:01.741
MARISHA: What am I doing, intimidation? 14. She is
not a child.

03:02:01.741 --> 03:02:05.559
MATT: (Stammering)

03:02:05.559 --> 03:02:08.218
MARISHA: There's a rec center, community
service--

03:02:08.218 --> 03:02:11.132
MATT: No, at the Victory Pit. It's in the
Pentamarket, probably. I don't know.

03:02:11.132 --> 03:02:13.140
MARISHA: Thanks, it's all you had to tell me.

03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:16.679
MARISHA: She takes the paper from Yasha and darts
off down the street.

03:02:16.679 --> 03:02:19.438
TALIESIN: She's not a verbal learner.

03:02:19.438 --> 03:02:20.989
MARISHA: I liked her.

03:02:20.989 --> 03:02:22.303
TALIESIN: I could tell.

03:02:22.303 --> 03:02:27.420
LAURA: I start yelling out: The third of the
Fessuran is the end of the harvest!

03:02:27.420 --> 03:02:30.232
SAM: Do we know what day it is today?

03:02:30.232 --> 03:02:32.408
LAURA: Hide your kids! Hide your wife!

03:02:32.408 --> 03:02:35.383
MATT: The third of Fessuran is about five days
away.

03:02:35.383 --> 03:02:38.194
LAURA: There's a Victory Pit!

03:02:38.194 --> 03:02:43.110
LIAM: Passion Pit on the third of Fessuran!

03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:49.146
MATT: You guys return to The Leaky Tap and we'll
say for the time being, we're going to have a few

03:02:49.146 --> 03:02:53.460
days of downtime. If there's anything specifically
you want to do, that's not story-centric.

03:02:53.460 --> 03:02:57.854
LIAM: I need money! He said out of character.

03:02:57.854 --> 03:03:00.426
MARISHA: Sell shit. Sign up for the Victory Pit.

03:03:00.426 --> 03:03:01.580
MATT: All right. What are you selling?

03:03:01.580 --> 03:03:06.971
LAURA: I have a lot of rings. I should see if I
can get any good money for some of them.

03:03:06.971 --> 03:03:09.544
MARISHA: Pawn the rings that we have.

03:03:09.544 --> 03:03:11.730
TALIESIN: Unless there's an opal in there, I'm
getting rid of the ring.

03:03:11.730 --> 03:03:16.102
MATT: None of the rings have gems. They're all
base metals, like gold and silver.

03:03:16.102 --> 03:03:18.921
LAURA: I have some fancier rings, though, from
before.

03:03:18.921 --> 03:03:20.933
MATT: If you want to try and hock some, sure.

03:03:20.933 --> 03:03:24.925
LAURA: That were stolen from your boss?

03:03:24.925 --> 03:03:28.246
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fine. They're probably fake,
then.

03:03:28.246 --> 03:03:29.899
MATT: They are.

03:03:29.899 --> 03:03:34.650
TALIESIN: Anything you took from the circus was
not real.

03:03:34.650 --> 03:03:37.343
ASHLEY: Wasn't The Gentleman supposed to reward
us?

03:03:37.343 --> 03:03:38.950
TALIESIN: It was trade.

03:03:38.950 --> 03:03:42.342
MARISHA: Us not getting charged for murder was the
reward.

03:03:42.667 --> 03:03:46.575
TRAVIS: While they're figuring it out, on one of
the days can I make my way by Ren Sutan's

03:03:46.575 --> 03:03:47.919
physician's office?

03:03:47.919 --> 03:03:49.646
MATT: You can do that. What do you want to do at
Ren's?

03:03:49.646 --> 03:03:52.560
TRAVIS: I want to casually look on the outside,
see if it's still in business, see if it's still

03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:56.460
bustling, or if anything has come their way.

03:03:56.460 --> 03:04:00.623
MATT: Okay. You spend a little bit of time
watching. It's still a functional physician's

03:04:00.623 --> 03:04:09.711
practice. People still need a physician. You can't
tell from a distance if it's darkened by the

03:04:09.711 --> 03:04:16.246
arrest of Lord Sutan, but you can't imagine it's
gone well within the family house. It's still a

03:04:16.246 --> 03:04:21.429
functional facility. It's still one of the finer
places to go for medical purposes.

03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:27.560
TRAVIS: Can I use my Mask of Many Faces, and I'll
adopt an older face with a gray beard and a dark

03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:29.797
hood, and can I walk into the physician's office?

03:04:29.797 --> 03:04:35.367
MATT: Yeah, easily enough. You walk into the main
area, and one of the clerks there with the same

03:04:35.367 --> 03:04:37.769
white robes approaches. "Can I help you, sir?"

03:04:37.769 --> 03:04:39.187
TRAVIS: (as Sean Connery) Yes, hello.

03:04:39.187 --> 03:04:43.819
(laughter)

03:04:43.819 --> 03:04:45.208
TALIESIN: Commit to it!

03:04:45.208 --> 03:04:47.621
TRAVIS: (as Sean Connery) Is Ren Sutan there?

03:04:47.621 --> 03:04:54.454
(laughter)

03:04:54.454 --> 03:04:57.127
MATT: "What do you require of the Doctor?"

03:04:57.127 --> 03:04:58.628
TRAVIS: (as Sean Connery) Just get him.

03:04:58.628 --> 03:05:01.067
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:05:03.217 --> 03:05:03.843
TRAVIS: Nine.

03:05:03.843 --> 03:05:13.581
MATT: He goes, "I'm sorry to bother you there,
sir, but he's not in at the moment, but we have a

03:05:13.581 --> 03:05:15.365
few of the clerks that could help you."

03:05:15.365 --> 03:05:18.709
TRAVIS: (Sean Connery voice peters out) You don't
want his trouble with the Myriad to spill over to

03:05:18.709 --> 03:05:19.915
you, do you?

03:05:19.915 --> 03:05:24.398
MATT: His eyes go wide. "We have no business--"

03:05:24.398 --> 03:05:26.099
TRAVIS: Fetch him. Now.

03:05:26.099 --> 03:05:28.044
LAURA: What happened to Sean Connery?

03:05:28.044 --> 03:05:29.483
TRAVIS: I fucking lost it.

03:05:29.483 --> 03:05:34.402
SAM: (as Sean Connery) Fetch him now. I'm a
Russian sub commander.

03:05:34.402 --> 03:05:39.467
MATT: "Very well. I'll go fetch him." He walks
past you out of the--

03:05:39.467 --> 03:05:42.824
TRAVIS: (as Sean Connery) Do your best. Losers
always whine about their best.

03:05:42.824 --> 03:05:48.348
MATT: He walks around you and exits the front of
the facility and begins walking down the road, out

03:05:48.348 --> 03:05:48.806
of sight.

03:05:51.256 --> 03:05:52.267
TRAVIS: I'll turn and follow him.

03:05:53.507 --> 03:05:54.554
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:05:54.554 --> 03:05:56.738
LIAM: (as Sean Connery) I cast Hexblade.

03:05:58.748 --> 03:05:59.540
TRAVIS: 17.

03:05:59.540 --> 03:06:02.818
MATT: Okay. Bee-lining straight to the nearest
crownsguard.

03:06:03.374 --> 03:06:10.305
TRAVIS: I will turn on my heel and use my Mask of
Many Faces to turn into a lovely woman.

03:06:10.305 --> 03:06:17.420
MATT: A moment later, two crownsguard come
rushing, blades drawn, behind the clerk, who's

03:06:17.420 --> 03:06:21.590
pointing towards the front of the building, and
they rush past you in the interior and begin to

03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:30.441
look around. They both split on the inside and
begin going through the different rooms. It seems

03:06:30.441 --> 03:06:35.604
not only did he not believe you, but dropping the
name of the Myriad in a public space like that,

03:06:35.604 --> 03:06:38.498
that's immediate call to the guard for these
guys.

03:06:38.498 --> 03:06:40.628
TRAVIS: I make my way back to The Leaky Tap.

03:06:40.628 --> 03:06:42.159
MARISHA: Wow, that's good to know!

03:06:43.509 --> 03:06:49.224
LAURA: I want to scout out the Hearth of the
Allhammer, the Raven's Den in the graveyard, and

03:06:49.224 --> 03:06:54.678
the Platinum House, and see if there's a lot of
guards, or if there's any of those that don't have

03:06:54.678 --> 03:06:56.402
a lot of guards.

03:06:56.402 --> 03:07:01.457
MATT: For the most part, the places of worship,
they're not very prominent. They're not huge

03:07:01.457 --> 03:07:08.417
temples. They're kept here out of law that was
decided upon, but they're nice. They usually have

03:07:08.417 --> 03:07:15.295
a handful of crownsguard stationed to each, but
it's not like they're under intense watch. There

03:07:15.295 --> 03:07:18.979
aren't a lot of worshipers during certain times of
the day.

03:07:18.979 --> 03:07:23.363
LAURA: Is there any one that seems emptier than
other ones?

03:07:23.363 --> 03:07:33.516
MATT: Of all of them, I would say it would be the
Raven's Den, which is at the Ossuary Gates, which

03:07:33.516 --> 03:07:41.228
is the large, vast graveyard of most of the
higher-ranked families of this city. The Matron of

03:07:41.228 --> 03:07:45.767
Ravens' temple is the one that's least attended,
largely because, dealing with death, it's not as

03:07:45.767 --> 03:07:48.336
bright and welcoming to the common folk.

03:07:51.246 --> 03:07:57.567
LAURA: Could I try to get in there when nobody's
in there?

03:07:57.567 --> 03:08:04.865
MATT: Okay. You wait for a while, and see a moment
where it is relatively calm. The outside of the

03:08:04.865 --> 03:08:11.224
shrine is this iron obsidian archway that
stretches up about 20 feet to frame a small

03:08:11.224 --> 03:08:17.059
shrine, topped with a statue of the Matron, and
her ravens about her, this circle of ravens that

03:08:17.059 --> 03:08:24.106
curves around. You see the female figure standing
in stone, the sculpture of the porcelain face--

03:08:24.106 --> 03:08:28.416
the only material that's not the same as the
darkened stone around her-- it's a white porcelain

03:08:28.416 --> 03:08:33.437
mask that is affixed to the front of the statue.
At the base of it, you can see a number of bowls

03:08:33.437 --> 03:08:38.726
and offerings that have been left around from
people that have come and passed through. Beyond

03:08:38.726 --> 03:08:47.256
that, there is a door to the small shrine behind
it, it's this small structure. Maybe 20 feet by

03:08:47.256 --> 03:08:55.048
ten feet. It's not a very large shrine. You've
seen groups of people that function as morticians,

03:08:55.048 --> 03:09:02.125
in long dark robes and dark clothing, that have
entered and exited this facility. You wait for a

03:09:02.125 --> 03:09:06.726
while, as there is one body that's being interred
at a family plot, and then as they all begin to

03:09:06.726 --> 03:09:12.739
scatter, you see a few other leave, and at that
moment, the interior, from what you can tell, is

03:09:12.739 --> 03:09:15.454
empty, or at least you've watched three
individuals leave.

03:09:15.454 --> 03:09:20.535
LAURA: Can I get in my disguise kit and affix a
mustache onto her porcelain mask, and put a wig on

03:09:20.535 --> 03:09:24.954
her, and then write across the bottom of it "The
Traveler was here," and leave a pamphlet?

03:09:27.484 --> 03:09:29.433
MATT: You can certainly try.

03:09:29.433 --> 03:09:34.793
LAURA: I want to see as much as I can do in that
amount of time before anybody comes back.

03:09:34.793 --> 03:09:36.910
MATT: Sleight of hand for the mustache.

03:09:39.540 --> 03:09:44.602
LAURA: Oh no. Off to a good start. Nine.

03:09:44.602 --> 03:09:52.719
MATT: As you leap up onto the statue, and go to
affix the mustache to it, a voice over by the

03:09:52.719 --> 03:09:57.549
shrine says, "Excuse me? Excuse me!"

03:09:57.549 --> 03:09:59.613
LAURA: Oh hello, yes?

03:09:59.613 --> 03:10:08.879
MATT: You see a pale young man, short blonde hair,
emerge with a similar dark robe that you didn't

03:10:08.879 --> 03:10:14.249
see in the inside of the shrine. He goes "Could
you please-- you're not allowed to climb the statue.

03:10:14.249 --> 03:10:18.765
LAURA: There was a smudge on her face, and I know
that the people get really pissed when there's

03:10:18.765 --> 03:10:22.754
stuff on their statues. I was trying to clean it
off for you.

03:10:22.754 --> 03:10:25.738
MATT: "I appreciate that-- Well, thank you. It's
just-- considered--

03:10:25.738 --> 03:10:29.646
LAURA: I rub my arm across it to try and clean it
off.

03:10:29.646 --> 03:10:31.611
MATT: "Thank you so much."

03:10:31.611 --> 03:10:33.240
LAURA: I think I got it though! Don't worry.

03:10:33.240 --> 03:10:34.256
MATT: "I appreciate that."

03:10:34.256 --> 03:10:36.917
LAURA: I'm going to sit here and worship her now.
That's all.

03:10:36.917 --> 03:10:38.872
MATT: "Please do. Please I can pray with you if
you'd like."

03:10:38.872 --> 03:10:41.062
LAURA: Oh, that'd be great.

03:10:41.062 --> 03:10:47.482
MATT: He sits down next to you and you both
silently sit there, on your knees, and begin to

03:10:47.482 --> 03:10:56.706
pray quietly up to the Queen. You watch as one
raven looks down over you both. Soon as he looks

03:10:56.706 --> 03:11:01.621
up and finishes his prayer, he extends his hand
for a moment and it takes off.

03:11:01.621 --> 03:11:05.659
LAURA: Does that always happen when you pray to
this lady?

03:11:05.659 --> 03:11:08.883
MATT: "Not often, but perhaps she smiles upon
you."

03:11:08.883 --> 03:11:13.747
LAURA: She does. I know she does because she likes
me so much because I worship her real good.

03:11:13.747 --> 03:11:17.053
MATT: "All right. Well, have a good day." He gets
up.

03:11:17.053 --> 03:11:17.700
LAURA: You too.

03:11:17.700 --> 03:11:20.632
MATT: At this point, the rest of the funeral
procession is now returning to the shrine.

03:11:20.632 --> 03:11:30.145
LAURA: Shit. Damn it! Is there anything to tuck a
pamphlet into?

03:11:30.145 --> 03:11:33.840
MATT: Oh yeah, you can tuck it under any of the
various offering bowls.

03:11:33.840 --> 03:11:35.439
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do that at least.

03:11:35.439 --> 03:11:40.145
TALIESIN: There's literally a cadaver that just
went into the building. Not to give you ideas.

03:11:40.145 --> 03:11:45.691
MATT: Now you know, perhaps another time you can
come by and try it again.

03:11:45.691 --> 03:11:48.151
LAURA: Yes, I'm going to try some other time.

03:11:48.151 --> 03:11:50.346
MATT: Anything else you wish to do over the next
few days?

03:11:50.346 --> 03:11:54.941
TALIESIN: I would like to try some chemical
altered states.

03:11:55.412 --> 03:11:56.383
SAM: Oh god.

03:11:56.383 --> 03:11:58.968
TALIESIN: It's time to have a good night.

03:11:58.968 --> 03:12:00.674
MARISHA: Wait is this with the shrooms?

03:12:00.674 --> 03:12:01.158
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:12:01.158 --> 03:12:02.739
SAM: Just you alone?

03:12:02.739 --> 03:12:05.605
MARISHA: Wait, what night are you doing this?

03:12:05.605 --> 03:12:09.113
TALIESIN: Probably the celebratory first night.

03:12:09.113 --> 03:12:11.254
TRAVIS: What time are you starting?

03:12:11.254 --> 03:12:12.962
TALIESIN: Oh, just before dusk.

03:12:12.962 --> 03:12:14.203
MARISHA: I'll join you.

03:12:14.203 --> 03:12:16.822
LIAM: What is the nature of the goods that you
have?

03:12:16.822 --> 03:12:18.726
TALIESIN: I have no idea.

03:12:18.726 --> 03:12:22.509
MATT, SAM, and LAURA: Skein.

03:12:22.509 --> 03:12:24.869
MARISHA: No, we bought those magic mushrooms.

03:12:24.869 --> 03:12:26.723
MATT: No, it's a fungal powder.

03:12:26.723 --> 03:12:29.477
TRAVIS: Hey Caleb, you want to take a look at the
pouch?

03:12:29.477 --> 03:12:33.710
MATT: Skein, I've heard many arguments over the
pronunciation.

03:12:33.710 --> 03:12:35.583
SAM: It's a real thing? You didn't make it up?

03:12:35.583 --> 03:12:38.871
MATT: No, the word is a real thing. It's a weaving
term.

03:12:38.871 --> 03:12:46.951
LIAM: If I take a look at this skein, can I take a
guess at what kind of illicit material I'm looking at?

03:12:47.531 --> 03:12:53.163
MATT: It's a fungus. Make a medicine check.

03:12:53.163 --> 03:12:54.990
LIAM: Yeah, I have bad experience with fungus.

03:12:54.990 --> 03:12:58.340
LAURA: I can do a medicine check. Do you want me
to look at it?

03:12:58.340 --> 03:13:00.398
LIAM: Medicine you say? That is a 13.

03:13:00.398 --> 03:13:06.948
MATT: It looks to be a fungus of some sort with a
property to it.

03:13:06.948 --> 03:13:11.136
LIAM: Yeah, I don't have good association with
that. You take that back.

03:13:11.136 --> 03:13:13.883
TALIESIN: There's only enough for two other people
to take it.

03:13:13.883 --> 03:13:18.202
MARISHA: Well, I have mine. Then you bought some
too, right?

03:13:18.202 --> 03:13:21.449
TRAVIS: I'm holding it in my fucking hand. Don't
you see it?

03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:23.804
MARISHA: Wait, how much is that?

03:13:23.804 --> 03:13:25.253
ASHLEY: No, you guys go.

03:13:25.253 --> 03:13:27.159
TRAVIS: I'm not going to take it. I was letting
you know I'm bought it.

03:13:27.159 --> 03:13:30.325
ASHLEY: Oh well here. I always partake what--

03:13:30.325 --> 03:13:35.386
LAURA: I mean we could poison somebody later. That
would be fun.

03:13:35.386 --> 03:13:39.788
TALIESIN: Well, it's a little late, because I
already took mine. I'm waiting to see what's happening.

03:13:40.107 --> 03:13:42.400
MARISHA: Wait. When Beau hears that she goes--

03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:44.546
MATT: Two of them have taken it.

03:13:44.546 --> 03:13:46.760
TALIESIN: Whoever's sober, keep us out of trouble.

03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:47.293
MARISHA: Yasha!

03:13:47.293 --> 03:13:51.197
ASHLEY: Well, there's something I need to go do.
You guys get started and I'll--

03:13:51.197 --> 03:13:53.393
MARISHA: (shouting) Oh no, Yasha you always do
this, no!

03:13:53.393 --> 03:13:55.407
(laughter)

03:13:55.407 --> 03:13:57.287
TALIESIN: Somehow she knows you, you always do
this.

03:13:57.287 --> 03:13:57.721
MARISHA: Bullshit!

03:13:57.721 --> 03:14:00.701
ASHLEY: I know, but you know I always take it and
I never feel anything.

03:14:00.701 --> 03:14:04.738
(laughter)

03:14:04.738 --> 03:14:07.302
MARISHA: (shouting) Where do you go, Yasha?

03:14:07.302 --> 03:14:09.156
TALIESIN: I'm excited.

03:14:09.156 --> 03:14:16.552
MATT: The two of you that have ingested the
skein-- Ten minutes pass, and the edges of your

03:14:16.552 --> 03:14:23.667
vision begin to cloud, and as you sit for a moment
your body begins to feel a bit weird. Nausea

03:14:23.667 --> 03:14:31.600
creeps in a bit. Then, a very faint snow of dust
in your vicinity begins to coat. You know the

03:14:31.666 --> 03:14:36.232
Upside Down? Where there's that weird material
floating around.

03:14:36.232 --> 03:14:37.305
LAURA: Like Legend?

03:14:37.305 --> 03:14:46.266
MATT: A little bit. Only for about ten feet out to
you. It's a ten foot area around you, and the

03:14:46.266 --> 03:14:53.245
coloration of your vision in this area becomes a
gray, colorless, black, white, and gray tone. I

03:14:53.245 --> 03:14:55.551
need you both to make a wisdom saving throw.

03:14:55.999 --> 03:14:56.932
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:14:56.932 --> 03:14:58.284
MARISHA: (shouting) This sucks.

03:14:58.284 --> 03:15:00.001
LAURA: Can I look at the stuff?

03:15:00.001 --> 03:15:01.307
TRAVIS: Yeah, here.

03:15:01.307 --> 03:15:03.706
TALIESIN: A wisdom saving throw? 15.

03:15:04.082 --> 03:15:05.305
MATT: 15? Okay.

03:15:05.305 --> 03:15:13.032
MARISHA: I'm going to say: Don't fuck me Gil! Oh,
okay. Just a wisdom saving throw? 17.

03:15:13.032 --> 03:15:23.882
MATT: The effects of it: you resist the hour long
stun it would have held you in, as it is not a

03:15:23.882 --> 03:15:34.478
healthy thing to ingest under any circumstances.
It is a very dangerous substance. For the

03:15:34.478 --> 03:15:37.974
duration, the two of you can see into the Ethereal
Plane out to ten feet.

03:15:37.974 --> 03:15:39.250
TALIESIN: I'm going walking.

03:15:39.250 --> 03:15:39.999
LAURA: Wait, what?

03:15:39.999 --> 03:15:42.762
TALIESIN: Who wants to go to a cemetery right
now?

03:15:42.762 --> 03:15:45.313
SAM: Wait it takes them to the Ethereal Plane?

03:15:45.313 --> 03:15:48.012
MATT: They can see into the Ethereal Plane out to
a range of ten feet.

03:15:48.012 --> 03:15:54.947
TALIESIN: I'm going to put on my least interesting
cloak, and I'm going to go find myself a cemetery.

03:15:54.947 --> 03:15:58.281
MARISHA: I flip my blue cloak inside out to the
brown side.

03:15:58.281 --> 03:16:00.701
TRAVIS: I don't know where they're going, but I
think we got to babysit them.

03:16:00.701 --> 03:16:03.679
LIAM: (distorted) How do you guys feel?

03:16:03.679 --> 03:16:06.109
ASHLEY: How do you feel? Do you see anything? Is
it interesting?

03:16:06.109 --> 03:16:08.056
MARISHA: I think it sucks.

03:16:08.056 --> 03:16:10.044
TALIESIN: We're going to work on it though.

03:16:10.044 --> 03:16:12.547
TRAVIS: Are you guys going on a <i>walk</i>?

03:16:12.547 --> 03:16:15.680
MATT: It's not quite like that.

03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:22.782
MARISHA: You can see really cool things.

03:16:22.782 --> 03:16:32.752
MATT: As this happens, this translucent
piranha-faced serpent scoots by, this ghastly

03:16:33.054 --> 03:16:39.761
looking angler fish creature like-- (gasping
breathing).

03:16:39.761 --> 03:16:40.702
LIAM: "Hey Steve."

03:16:40.702 --> 03:16:42.404
TALIESIN: I'm going for a walk.

03:16:42.404 --> 03:16:44.324
MARISHA: Molly, how long does this last?

03:16:44.324 --> 03:16:45.817
TALIESIN: I have no idea.

03:16:45.817 --> 03:16:49.912
MARISHA: Fuck. This is it. This is the rest of our
lives.

03:16:49.912 --> 03:16:54.455
LIAM: Are we saying this is night one, of a couple
of days of piddling around?

03:16:54.455 --> 03:16:58.541
MARISHA: I thought that this was the first night,
and this was our celebratory night.

03:16:58.541 --> 03:17:02.606
MATT: Yeah, this is more of a downtime period, so
I'm trying to get through events.

03:17:02.606 --> 03:17:07.467
TALISEN: I'm grabbing a little drink downstairs,
and then I'm going to go walk in whatever

03:17:07.467 --> 03:17:09.540
direction seems the most interesting shit outside
is in.

03:17:09.540 --> 03:17:10.668
MARISHA: I join Molly.

03:17:10.668 --> 03:17:12.297
TRAVIS: I'm babysitting them.

03:17:12.297 --> 03:17:15.031
LAURA: I'm going to follow behind and throw
pebbles at them from behind.

03:17:15.031 --> 03:17:18.561
MATT: In the best interest of keeping a low
profile for the next few days, you both wander out

03:17:18.561 --> 03:17:21.232
into the city streets, altered on--

03:17:21.232 --> 03:17:24.056
MARISHA: In our hoods and our boring cloaks!

03:17:24.056 --> 03:17:31.728
MATT: As you guys begin to wander through the
Interstead Sprawl, once again, the strange shapes

03:17:31.728 --> 03:17:39.691
pass through your peripheral. You occasionally
hear this chattering and distant chuckling, this

03:17:39.691 --> 03:17:50.598
weird alien laughter. There seems like drifting
spiritual energy that freezes your blood as you

03:17:50.598 --> 03:17:56.931
pass by. It's a really uncomfortable sensation.
For about an hour or so you wander in this space.

03:17:56.931 --> 03:17:59.382
At the end of the hour I need both of you to make
a constitution saving throw.

03:17:59.382 --> 03:18:00.166
LAURA: Oh no.

03:18:00.166 --> 03:18:02.978
TRAVIS: Glad I got another pouch of this stuff,
could come in handy.

03:18:02.978 --> 03:18:04.275
TALIESIN: This could come in handy.

03:18:04.275 --> 03:18:05.841
MARISHA: Just a saving throw?

03:18:05.841 --> 03:18:06.533
TALIESIN: 18.

03:18:06.533 --> 03:18:07.511
LIAM: Yeah!

03:18:07.511 --> 03:18:08.406
MARISHA: 20.

03:18:08.406 --> 03:18:13.275
MATT: You feel your body begin to grow woozy, and
for a second you feel like you're about to

03:18:13.275 --> 03:18:20.405
black out and pass out but you catch yourself, and
the sensation passes, your vision returns to

03:18:20.405 --> 03:18:27.934
normal, and it has run its course. You didn't
discern or learn much, and you feel exhausted.

03:18:27.934 --> 03:18:31.448
Your body is pretty strained by the process.

03:18:31.448 --> 03:18:32.976
TALIESIN: Drink and a bathhouse?

03:18:32.976 --> 03:18:34.881
MARISHA: I've got such cottonmouth.

03:18:34.881 --> 03:18:41.692
TALIESIN: You know what just occurred to me? I
didn't have a childhood. I've never said that out

03:18:41.864 --> 03:18:42.951
loud to someone before.

03:18:42.951 --> 03:18:48.832
MARISHA: Mmm. What happens if you have a
childhood, but it's barely a childhood because it

03:18:48.832 --> 03:18:56.171
was supposed to be someone else's childhood, but
it was you instead? Is that a childhood?

03:18:56.171 --> 03:18:57.850
TALIESIN: What happened to you?

03:18:57.850 --> 03:19:01.600
LAURA: We're following behind you guys right
here.

03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:06.396
TRAVIS: Let's get you to a bathhouse. You were
eating dirt about ten minutes ago. Said it was snow.

03:19:06.396 --> 03:19:10.839
MARISHA: Is that why I have cotton mouth? Ah
goddamn it!

03:19:11.130 --> 03:19:13.621
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got a big mud goatee.

03:19:13.621 --> 03:19:15.408
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you. You did so well.

03:19:15.408 --> 03:19:19.552
MARISHA: Well, I saw this goatman and he told me
just don't eat the yellow snow and you'd be okay.

03:19:19.552 --> 03:19:23.440
MATT: You get the essence, being one who's in tune
with your body, and you as well, that this is

03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:25.572
definitely not a safe substance.

03:19:25.572 --> 03:19:27.737
MARISHA: This is definitely not a safe substance.

03:19:27.737 --> 03:19:33.221
MATT: It may have, with the right scenario, some
situationally beneficial properties.

03:19:33.221 --> 03:19:37.280
MARISHA: I still have half a dose. I think it
would be real funny to plant it on somebody and

03:19:37.280 --> 03:19:38.515
get them busted later.

03:19:38.515 --> 03:19:40.000
TRAVIS: Was it a powder, or was it like crumbles?

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:41.930
MATT: It's like a crumbled, dry, almost a
spongy--

03:19:41.930 --> 03:19:46.389
LAURA: You guys looked like idiots, just so you
know.

03:19:46.389 --> 03:19:48.133
TRAVIS: Shall we get you cleaned up?

03:19:48.133 --> 03:19:50.048
LAURA: We need to get Nott cleaned up, too.

03:19:50.048 --> 03:19:51.442
TRAVIS: Nott cleaned up?

03:19:51.442 --> 03:19:53.000
LAURA: Yeah Nott's covered in ash.

03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.049
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, everybody, let's take a bath.

03:19:55.049 --> 03:20:04.117
ASHLEY: Can I have tried to find any information
on the conflict on the Xhorhas border?

03:20:04.117 --> 03:20:05.555
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:20:05.555 --> 03:20:07.996
SAM: Why you so interested, huh?

03:20:07.996 --> 03:20:10.741
LIAM: Yeah, I have shit to do as well, party
animals.

03:20:10.741 --> 03:20:13.241
MARISHA: Don't judge me.

03:20:13.241 --> 03:20:15.110
LIAM: I judge you heavily.

03:20:15.110 --> 03:20:15.822
ASHLEY: Six.

03:20:15.822 --> 03:20:19.427
MATT. You're not the best at gathering
Information. Maybe it's the--

03:20:19.427 --> 03:20:20.936
ASHLEY: It's how I talk to people.

03:20:20.936 --> 03:20:22.754
MATT: (shouting) "Tell me what you know!"

03:20:22.754 --> 03:20:27.718
ASHLEY: (deep voice) Hey! Conflict! Xhorhas?!
<i>Tell me</i>.

03:20:27.718 --> 03:20:34.195
MATT: You don't glean a lot of details. Most folks
tend to steer clear and walk to the other side of

03:20:34.195 --> 03:20:44.577
the road when they see you coming. What you do get
to hear is that-- Amongst the Ashkeeper Peaks, the

03:20:44.577 --> 03:20:50.152
mountains that largely border the south and
eastern side of The Empire, to the north, there is

03:20:50.152 --> 03:20:57.350
that break. That's where the Ashguard Garrison is
and the Rockguard Garrison. That's where most of

03:20:57.350 --> 03:21:02.580
the battle takes place. That's the protection
border that The Empire holds to keep the

03:21:02.580 --> 03:21:06.561
Xhorhasian hordes and creatures from the waste to
wander in. Although many still filter through the

03:21:06.561 --> 03:21:10.873
mountains and such. Apparently there's been rising
conflict out there.

03:21:10.873 --> 03:21:11.974
ASHLEY: To the north?

03:21:11.974 --> 03:21:16.474
MATT: Assaults on the garrisons, yeah. Northeast
of where you are. Further east more, east, little

03:21:16.474 --> 03:21:19.552
bit north. You have a map. You can look. You guys
bought a map.

03:21:19.552 --> 03:21:22.562
LAURA: Hey, you want to see this map? You're not
with me.

03:21:22.562 --> 03:21:25.690
LIAM: This is an entire three day weekend.

03:21:25.690 --> 03:21:28.438
MATT: Yeah, this is throughout a week so if you
wanted to pull the map out--

03:21:28.438 --> 03:21:29.500
LIAM: Pull it out!

03:21:29.500 --> 03:21:32.745
MATT: I don't know where you guys put the map. You
have a physical map.

03:21:32.745 --> 03:21:34.691
TRAVIS: Yeah, whip it out and shove it in his
hand.

03:21:34.691 --> 03:21:36.535
LAURA: It's over there somewhere.

03:21:36.535 --> 03:21:39.200
MATT: Go get it. Or somebody other than the
pregnant woman go get it.

03:21:39.200 --> 03:21:40.905
LIAM: No. Not as fun.

03:21:40.905 --> 03:21:42.821
MARISHA: Blood flow, she's fine.

03:21:42.821 --> 03:21:44.153
LIAM: Yeah, she's got to walk.

03:21:44.153 --> 03:21:46.083
MARISHA: She's pregnant. She's not dead!

03:21:46.083 --> 03:21:56.515
MATT: Correct. The conflict has been more common.
There's been assaults on the garrison. It seems

03:21:56.515 --> 03:22:05.357
similar to what you heard wandering through the
street before, there have been more whispers of

03:22:05.357 --> 03:22:10.064
children being stolen in the night from homesteads
close to the border.

03:22:10.064 --> 03:22:12.686
LAURA: (whispering) Hide yo kids.

03:22:12.686 --> 03:22:14.471
MARISHA: (whispering) Hide yo wives.

03:22:14.471 --> 03:22:19.132
LAURA: I found the map, you guys! I had it
somewhere safe.

03:22:19.132 --> 03:22:24.883
MATT: To the east, you can see the garrisons, and
the gap that leads to the Xhorhasian side.

03:22:24.883 --> 03:22:26.621
LAURA: This is the Xhorhas side.

03:22:26.621 --> 03:22:29.973
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, look at that. I don't think
I've ever been there before.

03:22:29.973 --> 03:22:31.339
ASHLEY: There's the Ashkeep.

03:22:31.339 --> 03:22:34.956
LAURA: Ooh, the Brokenveil Bluffs look scary.

03:22:39.216 --> 03:22:40.758
MATT: Anything else you guys want to do?

03:22:40.758 --> 03:22:49.802
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I have just enough ink and paper to
learn one spell, in the big pile of spells that I

03:22:49.802 --> 03:22:56.577
have right now, so I'm adding a low level one. I
am penniless.

03:22:56.577 --> 03:23:08.380
SAM: I will gladly give you money, but first-- I'm
going to cast Disguise Self, and turn myself into

03:23:08.380 --> 03:23:19.388
looking just like a normal halfling little girl
and spend an hour at a cafe just having lunch and

03:23:19.388 --> 03:23:22.920
being a normal person.

03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:24.701
LAURA and LIAM: Aww.

03:23:24.701 --> 03:23:30.668
SAM: Then after that, I'm going to go, and is
there any place if I investigate for a while, is

03:23:30.909 --> 03:23:36.591
there any place, or service, or person, or
anything that can send a package long distance

03:23:36.591 --> 03:23:40.436
safely? Money being no object.

03:23:40.436 --> 03:23:47.906
MATT: There are a few facilities in which there is
a parcel system that travels between the larger

03:23:47.989 --> 03:23:53.329
cities and can go to outskirt cities, but those
are a little more expensive. Yeah, that does exist.

03:23:53.329 --> 03:23:55.588
SAM: How much to get a package to Felderwin?

03:23:55.588 --> 03:24:05.266
MATT: To Felderwin? How big a package? For a
week's worth of travel, it'll cost you about five

03:24:05.266 --> 03:24:06.595
gold, not too much.

03:24:06.595 --> 03:24:07.792
SAM: Five gold?

03:24:07.792 --> 03:24:13.214
MATT: It's a fairly upper end system to send a
package.

03:24:13.214 --> 03:24:15.350
SAM: Pretty good, actually. That's cheap.

03:24:15.350 --> 03:24:18.715
MATT: For you guys, yeah, for the average person,
it's not cheap.

03:24:18.715 --> 03:24:20.763
LIAM: Ten games ago, though.

03:24:20.763 --> 03:24:23.417
SAM: I'll pay for rush delivery.

03:24:23.417 --> 03:24:25.937
MATT: There is no rush delivery. They can only go
by the speed of horse.

03:24:25.937 --> 03:24:27.956
SAM: I'll get insurance!

03:24:27.956 --> 03:24:29.927
TRAVIS and SAM: Certified.

03:24:29.927 --> 03:24:32.878
MATT: Tracking number included.

03:24:32.878 --> 03:24:38.504
SAM: Yes, thank you. I'll write a note, and I'll
put in various items.

03:24:38.504 --> 03:24:39.898
TRAVIS: Like what?

03:24:39.898 --> 03:24:55.779
SAM: A bunch of buttons, all the rings, door knob,
brass baby bottle, all the ball bearings, and the

03:24:55.779 --> 03:24:56.784
two bracelets.

03:24:59.694 --> 03:25:05.314
MATT: All righty. I think I know where you're
sending it, so. All righty.

03:25:05.314 --> 03:25:07.531
SAM: And some money.

03:25:07.531 --> 03:25:08.802
MATT: How much?

03:25:08.802 --> 03:25:09.502
SAM: 50.

03:25:09.502 --> 03:25:17.741
MATT: 50 gold. You assemble this package, wrap it
up, I imagine disguise yourself once more. Paying

03:25:17.741 --> 03:25:24.330
five gold for delivery, the parcel is sent and on
its way to Felderwin. All righty, anybody else?

03:25:24.330 --> 03:25:33.321
LIAM: Well, a couple of things, so I need more ink
and paper, the kind to transcribe spells. Before I

03:25:33.462 --> 03:25:40.440
get to that, and before they go off on their drug
party. Yes, before Jester goes.

03:25:40.440 --> 03:25:43.266
MATT: Not a party.

03:25:43.266 --> 03:25:45.001
MARISHA and MATT: Bad idea.

03:25:45.001 --> 03:25:52.183
LIAM: It has only been a short amount of time that
I am thinking, and I will be very careful, with

03:25:52.183 --> 03:25:52.982
the bag.

03:25:52.982 --> 03:25:54.612
LAURA: Are you coming onto me?

03:25:59.222 --> 03:26:07.926
LIAM: I was going to ask if I could hold the
Haversack and its contents for a day, so that I

03:26:07.926 --> 03:26:11.440
could better inspect and understand the thing
that--

03:26:11.440 --> 03:26:16.211
LAURA: Why do you have to do that? It's pink! It's
mine! I paid for it!

03:26:16.211 --> 03:26:21.373
LIAM: I understand that. I don't want to keep the
bag. I want to have it before you go off to do, I

03:26:21.373 --> 03:26:23.356
don't know, maybe you're going on a tour or
something?

03:26:23.356 --> 03:26:28.429
LAURA: I'm not going to do anything. Do you want
to hang out with me, and then you can look in the

03:26:28.429 --> 03:26:29.619
bag with me?

03:26:30.529 --> 03:26:33.244
LIAM: Aren't you about to go out with them? You
told me you were leaving.

03:26:33.244 --> 03:26:35.276
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

03:26:37.256 --> 03:26:47.126
LIAM: Well, all right, I would love to inspect our
special <i>package</i> and try to understand it better,

03:26:47.126 --> 03:26:48.258
if you want to be present for that--

03:26:48.258 --> 03:26:53.784
LAURA: There's a lot of people that inspect their
special packages. You get to know yourself <i>real</i>

03:26:53.784 --> 03:26:55.515
good, Caleb.

03:26:59.265 --> 03:27:04.922
LIAM: I know you are going to drag me over the
coals for this request, and that is fine. I would

03:27:04.922 --> 03:27:11.437
like the dungeon master to fast forward to the
part where you tell me if you will allow me to

03:27:11.437 --> 03:27:14.863
inspect the contents of this Haversack.

03:27:14.863 --> 03:27:17.031
LAURA: Yeah. You want to look at it?

03:27:17.031 --> 03:27:18.661
LIAM: Do you want to do this together?

03:27:18.661 --> 03:27:21.188
LAURA: Yeah, I'll hang out with you. I really want
to see it, too.

03:27:21.188 --> 03:27:25.263
LIAM: On a different night, maybe tomorrow night,
because you just told me you were about to go out

03:27:25.263 --> 03:27:25.890
with Molly.

03:27:25.890 --> 03:27:30.716
LAURA: Then maybe I'll keep it now, and then I'll
come back tomorrow night and we'll do this again.

03:27:30.716 --> 03:27:33.116
LIAM: Just inspect what's in the bag.

03:27:33.517 --> 03:27:37.440
LAURA: Special packages and everything like that.
I leave to go on to watch them.

03:27:37.440 --> 03:27:40.816
(laughter)

03:27:40.816 --> 03:27:48.667
LIAM: When she leaves, I look to the mirror in my
room and I'm like red-faced, and I stare at

03:27:48.667 --> 03:27:52.797
myself, like dead expression, for a good 30
seconds.

03:27:52.797 --> 03:27:56.748
(laughter)

03:27:56.748 --> 03:27:58.254
LIAM: Then I find Nott.

03:27:58.254 --> 03:28:03.467
LAURA: I'll go see you again tomorrow. I come
back. Hey, okay, do you want to check this out now?

03:28:03.735 --> 03:28:07.613
LIAM: What, are you back already? No, wait a
second! I'm talking to Nott, in this part of the day.

03:28:07.613 --> 03:28:10.327
MATT: Yeah, we'll come back. You find Nott.

03:28:10.327 --> 03:28:19.144
LIAM: I'm really blushing. How much disposable
income do you have at the moment?

03:28:19.144 --> 03:28:27.333
SAM: Disposable? I have 285 gold, and therefore,
disposable: 280.

03:28:31.513 --> 03:28:37.395
LIAM: Would you possibly loan me 200 gold?

03:28:38.535 --> 03:28:40.835
SAM: Here's 280 gold.

03:28:40.835 --> 03:28:43.642
LAURA: (whispering) You need 50 still to send in
your package.

03:28:43.642 --> 03:28:44.522
SAM: Already done.

03:28:44.522 --> 03:28:47.643
LAURA: Oh! How much money did you have?

03:28:50.243 --> 03:28:51.695
LIAM: I don't think I need that much.

03:28:51.695 --> 03:28:54.419
SAM: Give me the change when you're done
spending.

03:28:54.419 --> 03:29:00.160
LIAM: I will give you the change. Thank you,
friend. I will pay you back.

03:29:00.160 --> 03:29:02.655
SAM: Fine. Or not.

03:29:02.655 --> 03:29:11.379
LIAM: Thank you for teaching me how to-- and I
pull out the wire and back up 20 feet across the

03:29:11.379 --> 03:29:17.485
room. Whisper: teaching me this spell. You can
reply to this message.

03:29:17.485 --> 03:29:24.247
SAM: Oh! You're welcome, young padawan.

03:29:25.497 --> 03:29:28.498
LIAM: You know the thing about it for us is, we
can go--

03:29:28.498 --> 03:29:30.020
SAM: You have to cast it again!

03:29:30.020 --> 03:29:33.265
LIAM: No, we can go back and forth over and over
again, just you and me. It's endless.

03:29:33.265 --> 03:29:36.411
SAM: Oh, you're right! It's forever. It's a little
muffled.

03:29:36.411 --> 03:29:41.480
LIAM: For the other <i>Dummkopfs</i> it's only, they
can say one thing back, but you and I, we can keep going.

03:29:41.480 --> 03:29:45.175
SAM: This is really good. I can also hear you
across the room though.

03:29:45.631 --> 03:29:49.022
LIAM: I know. I understand, but for demonstration
purposes.

03:29:49.022 --> 03:29:50.386
SAM: Sure.

03:29:50.386 --> 03:29:51.523
LIAM: Well, thank you.

03:29:51.523 --> 03:29:53.433
SAM: Good job. Over and out.

03:29:53.433 --> 03:29:59.433
LIAM: I will go to Mr. Sol's establishment.

03:29:59.433 --> 03:30:01.636
(phone trilling)

03:30:01.636 --> 03:30:04.358
LIAM: That's the sound the door makes when you
enter Pumat's store!

03:30:04.358 --> 03:30:06.529
MATT: Yeah. Where are you going?

03:30:06.529 --> 03:30:09.642
LIAM: To Pumat's to buy ink and paper.

03:30:09.642 --> 03:30:15.290
MATT: Easy enough to do. "You go ahead and
purchase enough materials as you need to get your

03:30:15.290 --> 03:30:18.234
spells there transcribed. Good on you."

03:30:18.234 --> 03:30:23.364
LIAM: Thank you. I buy 200 gold worth and I bring
Nott the 85 gold change.

03:30:23.364 --> 03:30:24.352
MATT: Sure enough.

03:30:24.352 --> 03:30:27.306
ASHLEY: May I sell my other sword?

03:30:27.306 --> 03:30:32.965
MATT: "You may. It's not going to fetch you too
much because it's seen a lot of use. "

03:30:33.474 --> 03:30:37.429
ASHLEY: I sharpen it. It's so sharp. I sharpen it
every night.

03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:45.345
MATT: "That's wonderful. I think in the long run,
that'll be a very useful feature, but it's also

03:30:45.345 --> 03:30:48.337
not that uncommon of an object-- "

03:30:48.337 --> 03:30:50.559
ASHLEY: It's touched by the moon.

03:30:50.559 --> 03:30:54.493
MATT: "Yeah. I'm touched by the sun every
morning."

03:30:54.493 --> 03:30:57.955
(laughter)

03:30:57.955 --> 03:31:02.414
MATT: "I'll happily give you 30 gold pieces for
that there sword, if you don't mind?"

03:31:04.264 --> 03:31:09.148
ASHLEY: I paid all of my money for this, and it
was so much more than that.

03:31:09.725 --> 03:31:14.282
MATT: "Well, that's the nature of business. I'm
afraid." Make a persuasion check, if you want.

03:31:16.492 --> 03:31:18.078
Your persuasion pity roll.

03:31:21.438 --> 03:31:21.958
ASHLEY: 11.

03:31:24.478 --> 03:31:25.773
MATT: "All of your money?"

03:31:25.773 --> 03:31:28.986
ASHLEY: Yeah. It actually was.

03:31:28.986 --> 03:31:31.919
MATT: "I'll take it off your hands for 40."

03:31:34.509 --> 03:31:35.400
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

03:31:35.400 --> 03:31:39.226
MATT: "All right. We'll find a good home for it. I
trust you on that."

03:31:39.226 --> 03:31:41.396
ASHLEY: Okay. Thank you, Pumat.

03:31:41.396 --> 03:31:42.666
MATT: "No problem."

03:31:42.666 --> 03:31:44.244
TRAVIS: (whispers) Always remember your first
one.

03:31:44.244 --> 03:31:47.758
ASHLEY: (whispers) It wasn't my first sword.

03:31:47.758 --> 03:31:49.444
TRAVIS: (whispers) Well, shit.

03:31:51.684 --> 03:31:53.042
SAM: Is my flask done?

03:31:53.042 --> 03:31:54.084
MATT: Your flask is done.

03:31:54.084 --> 03:31:54.704
SAM: Yes!

03:31:58.504 --> 03:32:01.098
MATT: A Flask of Endless Alcohol.

03:32:01.098 --> 03:32:04.648
SAM: Wow. That's not an item on DnD Beyond.

03:32:04.648 --> 03:32:08.282
MATT: No, but it'll be an item on your person
tomorrow. When I get in there to customize it.

03:32:08.282 --> 03:32:09.921
It'll be waiting for you.

03:32:09.921 --> 03:32:18.924
MARISHA: I'll wake up in the morning, early after
my drug hangover, and make my way, quietly.

03:32:19.375 --> 03:32:20.355
MATT: Quite a headache.

03:32:20.355 --> 03:32:25.260
MARISHA: Quite a headache! Coffee, the bacon that
I had in my pocket from yesterday.

03:32:25.260 --> 03:32:27.482
MATT: Pocket bacon! It's the best kind!

03:32:27.482 --> 03:32:30.161
MARISHA: I head to the Cobalt Reserve.

03:32:30.161 --> 03:32:33.545
MATT: Cobalt Soul. Cobalt Reserve is on
Tal'Dorei.

03:32:33.545 --> 03:32:36.816
MARISHA: Sorry, the Cobalt Soul branch in Zadash.

03:32:36.816 --> 03:32:41.266
MATT: All righty. You head to the Archive. What
would you like to do?

03:32:41.266 --> 03:32:44.562
MARISHA: I'll see if I can find Dairon.

03:32:45.712 --> 03:32:55.124
MATT: All right. You ask around for a bit. Some of
the various monks recognize you on entry, and they

03:32:55.393 --> 03:33:01.811
greet you with an acknowledging nod. You didn't
make a lot of friends while you were here, of course.

03:33:01.811 --> 03:33:02.546
MARISHA: Sup?

03:33:06.496 --> 03:33:18.084
MATT: However, you do come across Archivist Xenoth
who, as you're asking the question, one of the

03:33:18.084 --> 03:33:24.436
monks sends you over to Xenoth. He goes, "Oh,
Beauregard. It's good to see you."

03:33:24.436 --> 03:33:25.164
MARISHA: Hey!

03:33:25.164 --> 03:33:29.382
MATT: "How may we help you?"

03:33:29.382 --> 03:33:30.765
MARISHA: Is Dairon in?

03:33:30.765 --> 03:33:35.786
MATT: "I can go and inquire. Are you here for more
training?"

03:33:35.786 --> 03:33:40.248
MARISHA: Just find Dairon. Thank you.

03:33:40.248 --> 03:33:50.401
MATT: He looks genuinely spooked by the smile and
is like, "That's something. Manners! That's new.

03:33:50.401 --> 03:33:51.661
I'm proud of-- "

03:33:51.661 --> 03:33:52.950
MARISHA: Just go find Dairon.

03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:57.938
MATT: "Right, all right." He turns around and
ascends up one of the slowly curving staircases

03:33:57.938 --> 03:34:04.098
that is carved through one of the bookshelves. You
see a bookshelf that ends and then a further depth

03:34:04.098 --> 03:34:09.466
in and there's a staircase that rides up to the
top. There's a second level above. He's gone for

03:34:09.466 --> 03:34:13.603
about 15 or so minutes and then eventually
descends the stairs. From behind, you can see

03:34:13.603 --> 03:34:26.946
Dairon. Her dark skin over the shoulders draped in
this long cloak-vest, similar to the arraignments

03:34:26.946 --> 03:34:37.361
you wear, but with a deep gray. Her at-home wear.
As she steps down, her elvish features smiling,

03:34:37.361 --> 03:34:47.126
her eyes taking acknowledgement of your presence,
approaches you. "You have called for me."

03:34:47.126 --> 03:34:50.126
MARISHA: Talk in private?

03:34:50.665 --> 03:34:56.177
MATT: "Of course. This way," and Dairon walks
past. Xenoth goes, "It was good to see you, Beauregard!"

03:34:56.177 --> 03:34:57.793
MARISHA: Bye, Xenoth!

03:34:57.793 --> 03:35:05.017
MATT: Dairon leads you to one of the meeting
chambers, which is usually used for research and

03:35:05.017 --> 03:35:12.209
individuals that want to quietly read through
books or take notes. Dairon closes the door

03:35:12.209 --> 03:35:16.305
behind, and it's just the two of you. "So what are
the honors?"

03:35:16.305 --> 03:35:20.351
MARISHA: Just want to let you know I'm in town and
busy.

03:35:20.351 --> 03:35:29.293
MATT: "Good. I've heard. You are making a small
name for yourself with your friends."

03:35:29.293 --> 03:35:31.023
MARISHA: Is that good or bad?

03:35:31.023 --> 03:35:32.536
MATT: "I don't know, is it?"

03:35:32.536 --> 03:35:34.284
MARISHA: I don't know. It's hard to read you.

03:35:34.284 --> 03:35:45.800
MATT: "Good. I've worked hard to not be easy to
read. I'll tell you one thing: being invisible can

03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:54.596
get you in some doors that otherwise you could
not, but notoriety can get you in doors that you

03:35:54.596 --> 03:36:00.340
couldn't otherwise as well. Either path has its
benefits; the choice is yours which to take."

03:36:00.340 --> 03:36:06.561
MARISHA: You don't think the two could be mutually
exclusive? Or best of both worlds?

03:36:06.561 --> 03:36:12.710
MATT: (chuckles) "With enough training and
discipline, maybe. Two things, unfortunately, you lack."

03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:14.018
MARISHA: Hey!

03:36:14.018 --> 03:36:21.190
MATT: "In time, perhaps. So why are you here? Just
to tell me you're in town?"

03:36:24.274 --> 03:36:30.250
MARISHA: No, that I'm back and I'm dedicated. I
figured showing up would be good, you know?

03:36:30.250 --> 03:36:34.958
MATT: "That is good. I'm proud of you. Do you wish
to train?"

03:36:34.958 --> 03:36:38.878
MARISHA: Do you have time?

03:36:38.878 --> 03:36:40.800
MATT: "I always have time."

03:36:41.500 --> 03:36:43.423
MARISHA: My kind of woman. Let's go.

03:36:43.423 --> 03:36:48.191
MATT: "All right." Dairon leads you out of the
chamber and down below the archive where, as you

03:36:48.191 --> 03:36:57.459
recall, is the subterranean training boxes for the
monks in which you have sand pits, you have all

03:36:57.459 --> 03:37:09.796
sorts of assembled-- essentially-- the word
escapes me-- A series of things you have to climb--

03:37:10.486 --> 03:37:11.511
MARISHA: Obstacle course?

03:37:11.511 --> 03:37:15.757
MATT: Thank you! An obstacle course-- my brain is
not working right now, at the moment. Obstacle

03:37:15.757 --> 03:37:21.948
courses, and places that are designed to help you
gain more skill in advancing through urban and

03:37:21.948 --> 03:37:33.986
exterior vicinities. It looks like a parkour park
a little bit, but not-- there in that space, you

03:37:33.986 --> 03:37:39.143
and Dairon spend the better part of the
afternoon-- her essentially beating the shit out

03:37:39.143 --> 03:37:46.902
of you via these courses, showing you some better
placement of your applications of Extract Aspects,

03:37:46.902 --> 03:37:52.590
hearing tales about the things you've encountered,
and teaching you the importance of the specific

03:37:52.590 --> 03:37:58.080
bits of information that is most useful in the
heat of battle-- advancing this training and

03:37:58.080 --> 03:38:02.172
giving you a little more focused idea of the path
that you have been taking, and the path that you

03:38:02.172 --> 03:38:02.740
are going.

03:38:02.740 --> 03:38:11.864
MARISHA: I tell her about the Xhorhasian spies and
the terrorist that we encountered. Does she seem

03:38:11.864 --> 03:38:13.788
like she knew that knowledge or not?

03:38:13.788 --> 03:38:18.451
MATT: She knew that they had come through; she is
caught off guard that you had actually encountered

03:38:18.451 --> 03:38:25.735
them directly. Dairon says, "Interesting. I will
take this into my studies."

03:38:25.735 --> 03:38:34.243
MARISHA: They said they were looking for an
artifact. Something that the wizards here had

03:38:34.243 --> 03:38:42.777
stolen? Something that they said furthered their
bloodline and made sure that they furthered their

03:38:42.777 --> 03:38:46.630
population. I don't know. Do you know anything
about it?

03:38:46.630 --> 03:38:52.870
MATT: Dairon goes from this very cold exterior.
For the first moment, you see a brief crack of

03:38:52.870 --> 03:39:04.321
emotion, and she leans in. "Whatever those things
told you, do not trust it. Do not take it as

03:39:04.321 --> 03:39:08.704
anything but desire to conquer and kill."

03:39:08.704 --> 03:39:15.192
MARISHA: Why else would they attack the tower if
they weren't looking for something specific?

03:39:15.192 --> 03:39:20.386
MATT: "Oh, I'm sure they were looking for
something. Do not show pity for these things."

03:39:20.386 --> 03:39:24.783
MARISHA: I never said I show pity. I wanted to
know what the hell this artifact was that they

03:39:24.783 --> 03:39:28.061
were after. Figured you here at the Cobalt Soul
would know.

03:39:28.061 --> 03:39:36.889
MATT: "Unfortunately, the detailed business of the
Cerberus Assembly is very carefully guarded and

03:39:36.889 --> 03:39:42.188
outside of our jurisdiction, but we're doing our
best to keep an eye in case anything slips through

03:39:42.188 --> 03:39:48.136
the cracks. They do a lot of good, but I don't
trust a mage that powerful."

03:39:48.136 --> 03:39:54.806
MARISHA: We wouldn't have any records on some
Xhorhasian artifact that apparently keeps them alive?

03:39:55.551 --> 03:39:57.359
MATT: "None that I've come across."

03:39:57.359 --> 03:40:00.131
MARISHA: All right.

03:40:00.131 --> 03:40:07.215
MATT: "Keep your ear out. If you encounter another
one of these things-- these objects-- or at worse,

03:40:07.456 --> 03:40:11.959
another one of these Cricks, bring what it has,
bring it to us."

03:40:11.959 --> 03:40:16.295
MARISHA: All right. Thank you, Dairon.

03:40:16.295 --> 03:40:20.838
MATT: "Of course. I may not be here in a month or
so--"

03:40:20.838 --> 03:40:21.660
MARISHA: What?

03:40:21.660 --> 03:40:28.484
MATT: "I'm going to travel to Bladegarden. See
what I can gather on the front lines. With these

03:40:28.484 --> 03:40:39.778
conflicts escalating, I wish to be informed as to
who's in charge there and perhaps what dangers

03:40:39.778 --> 03:40:42.263
might be creeping further into the empire."

03:40:42.263 --> 03:40:46.084
MARISHA: This Bloodgarden in the northeast side?

03:40:46.084 --> 03:40:51.135
MATT: "Bladegarden is outside of where the
garrisons are, yes. It's where most of the main

03:40:51.135 --> 03:40:52.539
military is held."

03:40:52.539 --> 03:40:59.055
MARISHA: Well, I still have a lot of training, so
come back alive, I guess.

03:40:59.055 --> 03:41:06.026
MATT: (chuckles) "I've survived long enough.
Anyway, one more round of sparring?"

03:41:06.026 --> 03:41:06.666
MARISHA: Sure!

03:41:06.666 --> 03:41:13.767
MATT: With that, you and Dairon continue to trade
blows and continue the lessons throughout the day.

03:41:14.124 --> 03:41:20.051
TRAVIS: That's awesome. I want to do that obstacle
course.

03:41:20.051 --> 03:41:23.026
MARISHA: I go back and join the rest.

03:41:23.026 --> 03:41:27.471
MATT: Anything else anyone wants to do?

03:41:27.471 --> 03:41:29.196
TRAVIS: (whispering) Dodecahedron, next night!

03:41:29.196 --> 03:41:32.836
LAURA: Yeah, I go knocking on his door the next
night.

03:41:32.836 --> 03:41:39.725
LIAM: I buy all that ink and paper and I spend the
rest of that day learning a small handful of new

03:41:39.725 --> 03:41:43.859
spells, which are in the Rolodex now, and then the
next night--

03:41:47.239 --> 03:41:49.837
LAURA: (rapidly knocking)

03:41:49.837 --> 03:41:50.695
LIAM: <i>Ja, hallo.</i>

03:41:50.695 --> 03:41:52.695
LAURA: (still knocking) Hello!

03:41:52.695 --> 03:41:55.113
LIAM: Are you coming in? Come in, it's open.

03:41:55.113 --> 03:41:56.907
SAM: This is night time?

03:41:56.907 --> 03:41:58.548
MATT: At this point, sure.

03:41:58.548 --> 03:42:01.048
SAM: I am definitely in the room.

03:42:01.437 --> 03:42:02.855
LAURA: (seductively) Hello Caleb. Hello Nott.

03:42:02.855 --> 03:42:03.344
SAM: (suspiciously) Hi.

03:42:03.344 --> 03:42:08.204
(laughter)

03:42:08.204 --> 03:42:14.010
LAURA: Caleb and I have a date to talk about his
special package.

03:42:14.010 --> 03:42:16.196
SAM: Do you need some privacy?

03:42:16.196 --> 03:42:21.595
LAURA: No, we're good. I open up the haversack and
pull out the box.

03:42:21.595 --> 03:42:32.846
LIAM: We are going to attempt to examine the
football, as it were. You can remain if you like.

03:42:32.846 --> 03:42:34.175
Are you curious yourself?

03:42:34.175 --> 03:42:37.643
SAM: Sure, you might need me to heal you.

03:42:37.643 --> 03:42:43.893
LIAM: To the best-- ooh, that's a good idea. You
know, to the best of my knowledge, this is-- and

03:42:43.893 --> 03:42:49.476
it's limited-- this is a very powerful thing, and
we are taking a risk--

03:42:49.476 --> 03:42:50.329
LAURA: Okay.

03:42:50.329 --> 03:42:53.468
LIAM: --but one that I think is worthwhile.

03:42:53.468 --> 03:42:54.964
LAURA: Okay.

03:42:54.964 --> 03:42:56.520
LIAM: Are you still game?

03:42:56.520 --> 03:42:57.715
LAURA: (clenching) Yes!

03:42:57.715 --> 03:43:07.610
LIAM: All right. We put the lead box on the floor.
Let's leave it in the lead box, but we'll lift the lid.

03:43:08.006 --> 03:43:11.747
LAURA: That's probably good, because people are
still looking for it probably, so it's probably

03:43:11.747 --> 03:43:14.158
stupid that we're fucking with it right now.

03:43:14.158 --> 03:43:18.310
LIAM: It is a calculated risk and we are going to
do this. We are not going to take a lot of time.

03:43:18.310 --> 03:43:25.903
SAM: It's nice that you guys are talking about
your limitations and setting your expectations

03:43:25.903 --> 03:43:32.304
before you go into this together. There's some
word that you need, like a safe-thing?

03:43:32.304 --> 03:43:44.818
LIAM: Yes, the safe word is Fjord, so if shit goes
pear-shaped, and one of us says Fjord, get Fjord.

03:43:44.818 --> 03:43:45.463
SAM: Sure.

03:43:45.463 --> 03:43:51.649
LAURA: Yes. Are you going to go all like (tonal
sound) while you look at it, or are you going to

03:43:51.649 --> 03:43:52.578
be normal?

03:43:52.578 --> 03:43:54.088
LIAM: Truthfully, I have no idea.

03:43:54.088 --> 03:43:55.056
LAURA: Okay, cool.

03:43:55.056 --> 03:43:56.089
LIAM: You game?

03:43:56.089 --> 03:43:58.741
LAURA: Totally game.

03:43:58.741 --> 03:44:02.801
LIAM: Okay, I am not coming on to you, but will
you hold my hand while we do this, that way if

03:44:02.801 --> 03:44:07.911
we-- (laughter) I cannot even look at you-- I
cannot believe I am doing this experiment with

03:44:07.911 --> 03:44:15.551
you. Let's not cover the camera, and let's examine
it together, and if we go to the Nine Hells or

03:44:15.551 --> 03:44:18.307
something, at least we'll be there together in
theory.

03:44:18.307 --> 03:44:18.825
LAURA: Okay.

03:44:18.825 --> 03:44:21.990
LIAM: We are going to look at this thing.

03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:24.028
MATT: Both of you, or just you?

03:44:24.028 --> 03:44:25.653
LIAM: I don't know. I am looking at it.

03:44:25.653 --> 03:44:27.161
LAURA: I'm looking at Caleb.

03:44:27.161 --> 03:44:29.137
(laughter)

03:44:29.137 --> 03:44:39.536
MATT: All right. As you focus on the strange
artifact, concentrating on it, you feel your

03:44:39.536 --> 03:44:44.729
vision drawn towards it. Part of you feels like
your body's leaning forward, like you're about to

03:44:44.729 --> 03:44:46.879
hit your forehead, but Caleb hasn't moved at all.

03:44:46.879 --> 03:44:47.643
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:44:47.643 --> 03:44:52.264
MATT: Caleb hasn't moved, but from your
perspective, you feel like-- and then suddenly,

03:44:52.264 --> 03:44:56.919
you feel like you're within the dodecahedron, and
like previously, suddenly there's this loss of

03:44:56.919 --> 03:44:59.555
light, and stars begin to peek out around you.

03:44:59.555 --> 03:45:06.254
MATT: You see shapes and forms of purples and
blues, these amorphous clouds that drift by on a

03:45:06.254 --> 03:45:15.917
scale that you cannot comprehend. You see darkened
spheres and objects passing you as you drift into

03:45:15.917 --> 03:45:24.022
nothing, into this void with distant dots of light
and sparkle. You get to that point you were

03:45:24.022 --> 03:45:28.473
before, where you feel like there's a threshold,
and your heart begins to race. Do you continue?

03:45:30.133 --> 03:45:30.707
LIAM: (whispers) Yeah.

03:45:33.707 --> 03:45:34.827
LAURA: I've got his hand.

03:45:34.827 --> 03:45:41.090
MATT: As you continue past that threshold, the
speed begins to increase.

03:45:41.090 --> 03:45:42.939
LAURA: (excitedly) Oh no!

03:45:43.496 --> 03:45:50.033
MATT: You feel the back of your neck begin to grow
warm and the hair begin to stand up. While you

03:45:50.033 --> 03:45:54.809
cannot see, you can still sense your body's
presence-- unmoving, but moving so quickly, this

03:45:54.809 --> 03:45:59.224
duel sensation is conflicting and causing your
heart rate to jump. Your breathing begins to speed

03:45:59.224 --> 03:46:08.507
up. You guys watch as his breathing begins to
increase. There, you see this faint gray glow

03:46:08.507 --> 03:46:15.070
approach and stop. Your speed comes to a slow
crawl and then halts. There before you, you see

03:46:15.070 --> 03:46:23.510
this tiny, little mote of gray, pulsing light; a
similar undulating pulse as the dodecahedron

03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:33.118
itself (heartbeat) before you. What do you do?

03:46:33.118 --> 03:46:36.238
LAURA: (growling) What do you do?

03:46:36.238 --> 03:46:39.455
SAM: (grumbling noises)

03:46:39.455 --> 03:46:49.912
LIAM: (long pause) Do you know if it's
achievable?

03:46:54.492 --> 03:46:59.798
MATT: No response. It looks like it's right there,
but a foot in front of you.

03:47:03.284 --> 03:47:10.348
LIAM: There's nothing about it that is sensible or
familiar; it's totally alien to me?

03:47:10.348 --> 03:47:21.200
MATT: It is immediacy and forever; it is an
ancient concept of possibility. As you ask these

03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:28.792
questions and begin to contemplate, the loop of
your thought process begins to cycle on itself,

03:47:28.792 --> 03:47:35.140
and you have to shake your head not to be lost in
this infinity that threatens to suddenly disperse

03:47:35.140 --> 03:47:43.004
you. Still, it is this tiny, gray thing before
you, and it seems to want your contact.

03:47:43.004 --> 03:47:44.004
LAURA: (whispering) Lick it!

03:47:45.474 --> 03:47:47.870
MATT: You look down and you can see your hand in
front of you.

03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:57.380
LIAM: Father and mother-- I hope I do not let you
down.

03:48:01.280 --> 03:48:04.738
MATT: As you reach out and touch, you guys watch
as this--

03:48:04.738 --> 03:48:06.548
LAURA: Did we hear him talking?

03:48:06.548 --> 03:48:16.337
MATT: You hear him talking. You see a faint mote
of gray begin to drift out of the dodecahedron,

03:48:16.337 --> 03:48:24.543
and then it floats and enters and vanishes into
the chest of Caleb.

03:48:24.543 --> 03:48:26.534
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh shit!

03:48:26.534 --> 03:48:32.676
MATT: Caleb, you feel this tiny mote come into
your hand, and then you pull it to your chest, and

03:48:32.676 --> 03:48:43.642
you feel this warmth, and for a second probability
becomes slightly malleable. This object is still

03:48:43.642 --> 03:48:51.088
so much more than what you understand; its power
is indecipherable on the scale of your puny,

03:48:51.088 --> 03:48:58.479
mortal knowledge, but you do know that somehow, by
reaching out to this device, you've managed to

03:48:58.479 --> 03:49:00.715
pull within yourself a Fragment of Possibility.

03:49:00.715 --> 03:49:03.907
SAM: What does that mean? Fragment of
Possibility?

03:49:03.907 --> 03:49:05.126
LAURA: It means he's lucky again.

03:49:05.126 --> 03:49:07.401
MARISHA: Yeah, it's the Luck feat all over again!

03:49:07.401 --> 03:49:11.480
MATT: Just so you guys know-- well, he'll tell you
when he gets around to it.

03:49:11.480 --> 03:49:13.488
SAM: No he won't! He will never tell us!

03:49:13.488 --> 03:49:14.697
TRAVIS: Come on! Dish.

03:49:14.697 --> 03:49:16.549
MATT: That's up to him to tell in the story.

03:49:16.549 --> 03:49:18.233
LIAM: It's a big paper. Let me read it.

03:49:18.233 --> 03:49:21.592
LAURA: Did we get it too because we were holding
his hand?

03:49:21.592 --> 03:49:29.258
MATT: No. The moment that that enters his chest,
Caleb pulls his hand from you. Caleb, your eyes

03:49:29.258 --> 03:49:31.698
adjust, and you're back in the room with your
friends.

03:49:31.698 --> 03:49:33.956
LAURA: (whispering) Damn it.

03:49:33.956 --> 03:49:45.902
SAM: Caleb, are you okay? You went skinky-doodle
for a second. Are you all right? Hello? Hello,

03:49:45.902 --> 03:49:47.895
Wildemount to Caleb?

03:49:47.895 --> 03:49:50.858
LIAM: I'm wide-eyed and not responding.

03:49:50.858 --> 03:49:52.695
SAM: He can't speak anymore, he's forgotten--

03:49:52.695 --> 03:49:57.771
LAURA: Caleb, we heard you talking, though. Are
you okay? Caleb?

03:49:57.771 --> 03:50:03.974
SAM: <i>Eins! Zwei! Drei!</i> He's forgotten all
language.

03:50:03.974 --> 03:50:06.647
LAURA: <i>Uno, dos, tres. Quatro.</i>

03:50:06.647 --> 03:50:10.910
LIAM: I'm literally trying to read this and
failing because of my friends.

03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:15.837
SAM: Quick. Make out with him. True love's kiss is
the only thing that will bring him back.

03:50:15.837 --> 03:50:18.292
LAURA: I think he seems like he's pretty okay,
though.

03:50:18.292 --> 03:50:19.930
SAM: Just make out with him!

03:50:19.930 --> 03:50:21.983
ASHLEY: (laughter) True love's kiss.

03:50:21.983 --> 03:50:23.938
LAURA: I don't know.

03:50:23.938 --> 03:50:26.939
MARISHA: Focus past the distractions.

03:50:26.939 --> 03:50:28.784
TRAVIS: Or you could just tell us.

03:50:28.784 --> 03:50:31.485
LAURA: You could read it out loud you know.

03:50:31.485 --> 03:50:33.575
TALIESIN: What's it say?

03:50:33.575 --> 03:50:37.227
MARISHA: Never. He's never going to tell us.

03:50:37.227 --> 03:50:46.438
MATT: Player privilege, unfortunately. He's the
one who that looked into it. If he doesn't tell

03:50:46.456 --> 03:50:48.150
you soon, I'll tell you, but--

03:50:48.150 --> 03:50:54.361
LIAM: That's your right-- I literally still don't
know what it does because everyone is talking constantly.

03:50:54.860 --> 03:50:57.062
LAURA: If you read it out loud then we'll shut
up.

03:50:57.062 --> 03:50:59.443
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll share <i>in</i> this adventure with
you.

03:50:59.443 --> 03:51:01.794
LAURA: That's right! Then we can all be a team.

03:51:01.794 --> 03:51:06.720
LIAM: The dodecahedron of gray faintly glowing
crystal is heavier than it appears. This is peer

03:51:06.720 --> 03:51:11.065
pressure. A set of handles are affixed to the
sides and it undulates to the touch. That's all

03:51:11.065 --> 03:51:16.697
you get. If a hand is placed on the artifact and
is concentrated on for one minute, the bearer is

03:51:16.697 --> 03:51:24.017
granted a Fragment of Possibility. A Fragment
lasts for eight hours or until used. A Fragment

03:51:24.017 --> 03:51:28.726
cannot be granted again until the next dawn. After
a creature with a Fragment of Possibility makes an

03:51:28.726 --> 03:51:34.181
attack roll, ability check, or saving throw they
can expend their Fragment to roll an additional

03:51:34.181 --> 03:51:38.381
d20 and choose which of the rolls is used for the
attack roll.

03:51:38.381 --> 03:51:41.532
MATT: Once per day it can grant one person a luck
point.

03:51:41.532 --> 03:51:43.206
LAURA: We can pass it around!

03:51:43.206 --> 03:51:47.591
LIAM: Ultimately, after an attack roll is made
against a creature they can expend their Fragment

03:51:47.591 --> 03:51:50.888
of Possibility to roll and additional d20 to see
if the attacker hits.

03:51:50.888 --> 03:51:53.092
MARISHA: You're like chipping away at it? Like an
ice sculpture?

03:51:53.092 --> 03:51:56.148
LIAM: It is like one luck. That lasts for eight
hours.

03:51:56.148 --> 03:51:57.806
MATT: It grants you this mote of energy.

03:51:57.806 --> 03:52:04.767
LAURA: We could literally-- we could each of us
every day pass it to a different person and then

03:52:04.767 --> 03:52:08.341
we could concentrate on it and we could have the
Fragment.

03:52:08.341 --> 03:52:10.921
LIAM: Am I able to tell if that is correct?

03:52:10.921 --> 03:52:16.083
MATT: It gives you-- the Fragment only lasts for
eight hours. You can only give out one Fragment

03:52:16.083 --> 03:52:17.313
per day, so--

03:52:17.313 --> 03:52:22.365
LIAM: Any one of us, one time. It can only grant
this gift once a day to one of us.

03:52:22.365 --> 03:52:26.381
MATT: Correct, yes. It could be the same person
every day or it could be a different person. It

03:52:26.381 --> 03:52:29.166
gives you the chance that this could be used by
anybody in your group.

03:52:29.166 --> 03:52:35.395
LIAM: I absentmindedly babble about what I think
this thing can do. It's very incoherent.

03:52:35.395 --> 03:52:38.774
LAURA: Why were you talking about your mom and
your dad, though?

03:52:38.774 --> 03:52:43.788
(silence)

03:52:43.788 --> 03:52:46.945
LAURA: Was that a weird question? Should I have
not asked that?

03:52:46.945 --> 03:52:49.053
SAM: I mean, it was on my mind, but I wasn't going
to bring it up.

03:52:49.053 --> 03:52:54.097
(laughter)

03:52:54.687 --> 03:52:56.460
LIAM: What did I say? What do you mean?

03:52:56.460 --> 03:53:01.396
LAURA: You said, "Mom and Dad I hope that I make
you proud--"

03:53:01.396 --> 03:53:03.006
SAM: Or don't disappoint you.

03:53:03.006 --> 03:53:08.629
LAURA: "--and I don't disappoint you and stuff,"
and also, "gee whiz, I should probably take baths

03:53:08.629 --> 03:53:09.939
more often."

03:53:11.239 --> 03:53:12.515
SAM: That's not-- not that part.

03:53:14.465 --> 03:53:17.531
LAURA: Well you were going to say that and then
the gray thing went into you.

03:53:19.151 --> 03:53:19.727
LIAM: Okay.

03:53:21.277 --> 03:53:25.463
SAM: You said, "Oh I wish I could share my
problems with my friends."

03:53:25.463 --> 03:53:28.380
LAURA: Yeah, that's what you're saying. I remember
hearing that part.

03:53:28.380 --> 03:53:32.844
(laughter)

03:53:35.514 --> 03:53:40.282
LIAM: What? That is a very common sentiment. Isn't
it?

03:53:40.282 --> 03:53:41.072
SAM: It is.

03:53:45.492 --> 03:53:48.722
LAURA: If you ever want to talk about it you can
just come to us!

03:53:51.232 --> 03:53:52.259
LIAM: Good to know.

03:53:52.259 --> 03:53:54.554
LAURA: We're super good at talking, both of us!

03:53:56.224 --> 03:53:58.795
LIAM: That is true. For both of you.

03:53:59.745 --> 03:54:01.895
LAURA: Tomorrow I want the thingy okay?

03:54:04.255 --> 03:54:08.386
LIAM: Well you are in possession of it for the
most part. I said I wanted to have a look at it.

03:54:12.716 --> 03:54:14.019
LAURA: You're right. I am.

03:54:16.239 --> 03:54:19.064
LIAM: We can take turns with it. We will decide.

03:54:19.064 --> 03:54:25.243
SAM: We don't have to tell the others about this,
do we? I mean we're supposed to be a team.

03:54:25.243 --> 03:54:30.453
LIAM: By the way, I shut the lead cover on the
box. Let's put it back in.

03:54:30.453 --> 03:54:39.937
LAURA: (gasping) Oh my gods! What if, now that the
gray thing is in <i>you,</i> the wizards in town will

03:54:39.937 --> 03:54:41.688
be able to sense you?

03:54:41.688 --> 03:54:44.059
SAM: What? Why would that-- no!

03:54:44.059 --> 03:54:46.714
LAURA: Maybe <i>you</i> should be in the lead case
now.

03:54:46.714 --> 03:54:49.636
LIAM: That's not how that works.

03:54:49.636 --> 03:54:51.072
LAURA: Are you sure, though?

03:54:51.072 --> 03:54:56.984
LIAM: I am sure, yeah. Also, with the knowledge
that I have and everything that just happened, am

03:54:56.984 --> 03:55:03.019
I aware-- the gray more that went inside me. Would
I know, does that limit this thing's ability to me?

03:55:03.019 --> 03:55:03.846
Or no?

03:55:03.846 --> 03:55:05.718
MATT: What do you mean?

03:55:06.319 --> 03:55:12.492
LIAM: Well in the description, DM, you said this
gray mote went into Caleb, not into them. Can

03:55:12.492 --> 03:55:13.454
anyone use this thing?

03:55:13.454 --> 03:55:14.994
MATT: Anyone can use it.

03:55:15.238 --> 03:55:16.656
LIAM: Good. All right. Just checking.

03:55:16.656 --> 03:55:18.311
LAURA: The next day the gray thing will go in
someone else.

03:55:18.311 --> 03:55:21.965
LIAM: Right. It's like the little, you know, when
you're learning lyrics for karaoke and the little

03:55:21.965 --> 03:55:23.379
thing bounces along.

03:55:23.379 --> 03:55:25.981
SAM: We all know what that experience is like.

03:55:25.981 --> 03:55:38.237
LIAM: Yeah, I think this is a very potent <i>thing</i>,
and we can use it to do a lot of good. You know,

03:55:38.237 --> 03:55:43.519
not in the heat of the moment to try to hit a
gnoll in the face with something, but when we are

03:55:43.519 --> 03:55:47.087
really trying to figure something out or do the
unachievable.

03:55:47.087 --> 03:55:51.490
LAURA: Or if like you <i>really</i> want to put a
mustache on a <i>fucking statue</i>.

03:55:51.490 --> 03:55:53.700
SAM: You need extra luck for that.

03:55:53.700 --> 03:55:55.543
LIAM: That's a good hypothetical.

03:55:55.543 --> 03:55:57.486
LAURA: Yeah, just in case you ever wanted to do
that.

03:55:57.486 --> 03:56:03.232
SAM: Can I just say, real quick, before we
adjourn, there was something that you were

03:56:03.232 --> 03:56:13.060
reluctant to do because of your own personal
fears, and you entrusted Jester to inspire you to

03:56:13.060 --> 03:56:22.470
do something that was possibly uncomfortable for
you, and it worked out great! I think that moving

03:56:22.470 --> 03:56:30.919
forward if you want to just go for it! As long as
you have trusted friends with you, then that would

03:56:30.919 --> 03:56:34.517
be a good option to do.

03:56:34.517 --> 03:56:45.375
LIAM: That was a lot of advice. I mean, it is no
secret that I like these people, so we are in good company.

03:56:45.877 --> 03:56:56.174
This is working out. You are, you know, you are
capable-- oh dear. I'm going to go to bed now.

03:56:56.174 --> 03:56:59.194
LAURA: Your son is just the cutest.

03:56:59.194 --> 03:57:01.051
SAM: He's not my son!

03:57:01.051 --> 03:57:10.278
LIAM: Definitely heard that. Awkward and weird and
makes no sense but I will-- oh, this is my room!

03:57:10.278 --> 03:57:12.297
You have to go to your room!

03:57:12.297 --> 03:57:15.115
LAURA: (sing-song) Okay, well goodnight then!

03:57:15.115 --> 03:57:15.998
LIAM: Goodnight.

03:57:15.998 --> 03:57:22.946
LAURA: Goodnight, Caleb-- If you need anything
I'll just be in another room--

03:57:22.946 --> 03:57:25.025
SAM: Get out! Just go! Just leave!

03:57:25.025 --> 03:57:34.255
MATT: The following day, through your various
lowkey journeys, you catch another town crier

03:57:34.255 --> 03:57:41.213
wandering through the town, shouting, "Murderers
of the High-Richter brought to justice. By the

03:57:41.213 --> 03:57:45.331
crown's protective eye, Zadash is free from these
treacherous cut-throats!"

03:57:45.331 --> 03:57:47.178
LAURA: Who was it?

03:57:47.178 --> 03:57:49.241
SAM: Who was it who killed her?

03:57:49.241 --> 03:57:52.323
MATT: (shouting) "I don't know! I'm just told to
tell this!"

03:57:52.323 --> 03:57:53.724
SAM: (shouting) What does it say?

03:57:53.724 --> 03:57:54.996
ASHLEY: It's all it says again!

03:57:54.996 --> 03:57:56.895
MATT: (fearful shout)

03:57:56.895 --> 03:57:58.306
LIAM: This is the next morning?

03:57:58.306 --> 03:57:59.494
MATT: This is the next morning.

03:57:59.494 --> 03:58:04.213
ASHLEY: How do they give you more information?
Just a headline; there's nothing else!

03:58:04.213 --> 03:58:09.949
MATT: Over the next few days, the Crownsguard and
the Righteous Brand, which is the name of the

03:58:09.949 --> 03:58:17.733
military of the Empire-- the presence at the gates
of Zadash has dwindled to normal. The backed up

03:58:17.733 --> 03:58:23.347
caravans and travellers begin to wash into the
city once more in preparation for the Harvest

03:58:23.347 --> 03:58:29.242
Close festival, now only but a few days away. You
watch as strands of linen all of the colors of

03:58:29.242 --> 03:58:34.519
autumn are affixed between street arches and
lantern poles; a celebratory display, far less

03:58:34.519 --> 03:58:39.465
fancy, but more widespread than the Harvest Close
Gala not but a week before in the Tri-Spires.

03:58:39.465 --> 03:58:42.382
That's where we're going to pick up next week!

03:58:42.382 --> 03:58:45.276
(cheering)

03:58:45.276 --> 03:58:46.604
LAURA: (singing) Victory Pit!

03:58:46.604 --> 03:58:48.432
MATT: We're going to pick up at the Harvest Close
festival!

03:58:48.432 --> 03:58:55.892
TRAVIS: Yeah! Skydive, baby. Oh shit! What is it
called? It's a--?

03:58:55.892 --> 03:58:57.962
LAURA: A Mote of Possibility?

03:58:57.962 --> 03:59:00.694
MATT: A Fragment. Fragment of Possibility.

03:59:00.694 --> 03:59:03.714
SAM: (singing) Mote of Possibility!

03:59:03.714 --> 03:59:07.034
MATT: Well done, guys.

03:59:07.034 --> 03:59:08.417
TRAVIS: Nice job, Matt!

03:59:08.417 --> 03:59:12.216
LIAM: I'm going to-- no, you should hold onto this
because you've got the Haversack.

03:59:12.216 --> 03:59:20.829
MATT: All righty, so I'll go ahead and get those
custom items over to your guys' inventory on D&amp;D

03:59:20.829 --> 03:59:22.219
Beyond tomorrow.

03:59:22.219 --> 03:59:23.425
SAM: Custom items?

03:59:23.425 --> 03:59:29.389
MATT: We'll come back next week for a Harvest
Close Festival. We get to have a festival.

03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:30.430
ALL: Yay!

03:59:30.430 --> 03:59:31.405
TRAVIS: Those always go well.

03:59:31.405 --> 03:59:33.266
MATT: Those always go well. It's going to be
great!

03:59:33.266 --> 03:59:35.253
SAM: Do we need to dress up, Matt?

03:59:35.253 --> 03:59:38.141
ASHLEY: Like we did for the winter festival at our
home game?

03:59:38.141 --> 03:59:41.541
MATT: That's up to you guys. You're more than
welcome to!

03:59:41.541 --> 03:59:43.029
SAM: What kind of festival? This is a winter
festival?

03:59:43.029 --> 03:59:49.738
MATT: Harvest Close. It's the end of autumn. All
the colors are like reds, golds, browns, tans,

03:59:49.738 --> 03:59:50.300
yellows.

03:59:50.300 --> 03:59:57.781
MARISHA: Oktoberfest! It's Oktoberfest, you guys.
Wait, do we come in the Ren Faire gear that we

03:59:57.781 --> 03:59:58.243
own?

03:59:58.243 --> 03:59:59.311
LAURA: We'll figure it out.

03:59:59.311 --> 04:00:01.816
TALIESIN: We'll start a brand new text thread.

04:00:01.816 --> 04:00:02.547
MATT: All righty.

04:00:02.547 --> 04:00:03.600
LIAM: <i>Lederhosen.</i>

04:00:03.600 --> 04:00:04.581
MATT: Indeed.

04:00:04.581 --> 04:00:06.520
TALIESIN: I own some really nice <i>Lederhosen.</i>

04:00:06.520 --> 04:00:09.447
MARISHA: You <i>do.</i> I was with you when you bought
them.

04:00:09.447 --> 04:00:14.992
TALIESIN: No-- were you? Oh, that's the other
pair.

04:00:14.992 --> 04:00:17.321
MARISHA: (laughter) That's the other pair?

04:00:17.321 --> 04:00:18.683
LIAM: Wow!

04:00:18.683 --> 04:00:20.517
TRAVIS: Only him.

04:00:20.517 --> 04:00:22.431
LAURA: That was fun, you guys.

04:00:22.431 --> 04:00:26.509
MATT: All righty! Well, we'll pick up next week.
We missed everybody who're out watching Avengers:

04:00:26.509 --> 04:00:29.783
Infinity War, but we're also jealous because we
didn't see it tonight. But! Seeing it tomorrow!

04:00:29.783 --> 04:00:35.137
Excited about that! Thank you for joining us. Hope
you had a good time. We love you guys, we'll see

04:00:35.137 --> 04:00:38.747
you next week, and is it Thursday yet? Good
night!

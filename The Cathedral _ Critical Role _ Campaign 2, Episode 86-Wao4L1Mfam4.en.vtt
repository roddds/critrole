MATT: Hello everyone, and
welcome to tonight's episode

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.729
of Critical Role,
where a bunch of us

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:03.871
nerdy-ass voice
actors sit around

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:05.036
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:07.781
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:07.781 --> 00:00:09.763
MATT: Like that every time.

00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:11.430
So before we get into
tonight's episode,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.305
we do have some
announcements to get through,

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:14.730
which begins with
our two sponsors

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.481
for tonight, the first of which
is Disney's Villainous Game.

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.440
Sam, if you don't mind?

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.810
SAM: Hey, this episode
is sponsored by our pals

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.130
at Ravensburger--

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.660
Rah-vens-burger?--
I don't know--

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.851
and their fun board
game, Disney Villainous.

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.310
It's a game where you play as
your favorite Disney villain,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.830
and compete against others to
reach your individual goals.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.280
And now you can get the core
set, The Worst Takes it All,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.460
and two expansions, Wicked
to the Core and Evil Comes

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.190
Prepared, and mix and
match your favorite Disney

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.700
villains, including
Captain Hook, King John,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.000
Scar, Evil Queen, and more.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.230
They also released some
beautiful 1,000-piece puzzles

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.690
using artwork from the game.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.030
(oohing and aahing)

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.750
To thank them for
their sponsorship,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.110
I wanted to dress as my favorite
Disney villain, the Evil Queen

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.130
from Snow White.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.760
But I couldn't find a costume,
so I just asked for any Disney

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.350
costume they had.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.099
And I am now evil
villainous Chewbacca.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.240
But I'm still going
to read the bit that I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.610
prepared for the Evil Queen.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.070
TRAVIS: What?

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.020
SAM: So just imagine
that this costume

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.092
is an Evil Queen costume.

00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:16.051
TRAVIS: Oh, good, yeah.

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:17.810
SAM: And here we go.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.930
Mirror, mirror in my hand, who's
the fairest Critical Role man?

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.470
MAX: Chewie, Chewie in
the chair, Matthew Mercer

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.252
is most fair.

00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:30.480
SAM: Okay.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.130
Okay, I totally get that.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.210
But who is second
fairest after Matt?

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.490
MAX: He's so stunning,
when you see him,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.380
the second fairest
is young Liam.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.180
TRAVIS: Oh?

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:43.130
SAM: Forget the
fairest thing, okay?

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.250
Who is the cleverest
man who plays?

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.880
MAX: I-- I feel like
you want me to say it's you.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.260
But I'd be lying, so I
don't know what to do.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.205
(laughter)

00:01:53.205 --> 00:01:56.390
SAM: Just tell me I'm pretty,
and we'll end this bit.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.948
Come on, Maxwell,
fucking say it.

00:01:58.948 --> 00:01:59.748
(laughter)

00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:01.690
MAX: Fine.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.690
This is weird, but sure.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.445
You're pretty.

00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:05.320
There, are you happy?

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.120
SAM: Yeah.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.000
MAX: God, why do
you do this stuff to me?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.139
I just want to do my job.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.372
That's it, I'm calling
HR. (yelling) Ed?

00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:14.564
(laughter)

00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:16.162
SAM: And scene.

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:18.621
Don't forget to get all this
great villainous stuff through

00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:23.390
Target at Bit.ly, that's
bit.ly/CRvillainous,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.570
V-I-L-L-A-I-N-O-U-S.
Back to you, Matt.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.020
(cheering)

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.210
MATT: Thank you, Sam.
LAURA: Go, Matt!

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.430
MATT: And our second
sponsor for tonight

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.967
are our friends who
have been with us since

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:34.425
begin him campaign
two, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:35.675
TRAVIS: (hollering) D&amp;D Beyond!

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:37.300
MATT: Beyond the fact
that they're just

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.929
a great tool for
digitally keeping

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.388
track of your characters, your
campaign, spells, creatures,

00:02:41.388 --> 00:02:43.597
the whole deal, they have
an encounter builder that's

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:45.050
out of alpha that's amazing.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.375
They've been a fantastic
supporter of the show

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:47.733
from the beginning, and
thank you guys so much.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.137
They also have great
articles that go up

00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:50.138
on their website
written by, actually,

00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:51.680
some friends of the
show, and they're

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.880
all pretty damn brilliant.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.170
So thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.563
Keep up the good work.

00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:57.697
All right, Travis, you have
an announcement to make,

00:02:57.697 --> 00:02:58.625
I believe?
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.270
Yes! Oh, I'm going to
grab my numbers here.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.290
Guys, we have nine days left
in our November fundraising

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.973
campaign with our
friends at OSD.

00:03:08.973 --> 00:03:10.640
And since we have
launched our campaign,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.910
we have banded together
to raise $19,000

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.590
to help our military community.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.210
And we have a very special
announcement tonight.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.940
My dear friend,
Travis Frederick,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.120
center for the world champion
soon-to-be Dallas Cowboys,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.795
legendary, all-time, woot-woot--

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:28.595
TALIESIN: Real Travis.

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:30.380
TRAVIS: Travis
Frederick has graciously

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.860
offered to donate $500
for every natural one

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.843
that we roll during
the month of November.

00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:37.032
SAM: The whole month?
TRAVIS: The whole month.

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:38.490
SAM: I thought it
was just tonight!

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.760
TRAVIS: No, the whole month!

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.750
(oohing and aahing)

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.482
And it's retroactive
from the beginning,

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:43.941
which means that
we have now raised

00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:46.855
over $23,000, which is amazing.

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:47.655
MATT: Insane!

00:03:48.455 --> 00:03:50.300
TRAVIS: Yeah, super,
super gracious,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.425
generous, such a great guy.

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.342
MATT: I'm going to make
you guys roll so much.

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:54.440
LAURA: Holy fuck.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.520
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.490
So if it sucks for us,
it's for a good cause.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.356
(awwing)

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:01.310
Thank you so much to
everyone that's donated.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.140
Please can continue
to share the message.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.170

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.230
Let's finish strong.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.741
We love you guys.
(cheering)

00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:10.480
MATT: That's amazing.
MARISHA: So cool!

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.120
MATT: Travis, thank you so much.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.230
That is incredible.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.250
And thank you all for donating
to this incredible cause.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.019
This is amazing.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.200
A huge epic congrats to
our very own Laura Bailey

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.025

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.370
(cheering)

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.430
Super proud of you,
that's amazing.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.910
LAURA: Thanks, you guys.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.250

And if you happen to like

00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:43.583
you can go ahead and

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:44.416

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:45.785
SAM: I mean, just
vote for her anyway.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:46.660
It doesn't matter if
you liked what she did--

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.247
LAURA: There's other
good performers in there.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.247
But vote for me.

00:04:51.247 --> 00:04:54.080

TRAVIS: Vote for my wife!

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.730
MATT: I tried to be civil.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.470
Our Austin live show
is this weekend.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.210
Two days from now.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.960
I've never prepared so
many maps in one week.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.740
Super excited to
see you guys there.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.950
It's our one shot,
the "Adventures

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.791
of the Darrington Brigade."

00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:16.250
It's part of our
Kickstarter awards

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.945
for the amazing animated
series Kickstarter

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:19.070
we did earlier in the year.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.112
Thank you guys so much
for that, and for allowing

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.190
this to happen.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.807
Please refrain from poiling--

00:05:23.807 --> 00:05:26.390
posting spoilers-- not poiling.
You can do that too, I guess--

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.150
MATT: --from posting
spoilers online if you're

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.890
there at the live show.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.120
And for those who
aren't able to attend,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.730
you can watch our
live show on Friday,

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.270

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.530

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.440
So keep an eye out for that.
TRAVIS: No poiling.

00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:45.843
MATT: Do not poil
anybody, please.

00:05:45.843 --> 00:05:47.010
MARISHA: No poiling, please.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.483
TALIESIN: You can have spoilers. Don't poil it.

00:05:48.483 --> 00:05:50.110
(laughter)
Don't poil that spoiler.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.527
MATT: I feel like
this past month,

00:05:51.527 --> 00:05:53.704
my brain's just slowly turned to
Swiss cheese from week to week,

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:55.464
and language is leaving me.

00:05:55.464 --> 00:05:57.470
(singing) Language
is leaving me.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.270
All right, sorry.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.630
(laughter)

00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:04.483
If Annie Lennox is a Critter, hi.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.070
Next Thursday is
the Thanksgiving

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.510
holiday here in America.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.600
So for those who are not here
and aren't aware of that,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.700
we will not be having
a session next week

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.320
on Thursday, because
we'll be having

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.445
the time with our families.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.039
Nor there will be an episode
of Talks Machina the week

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.248
after, Tuesday, December 3rd.

00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:25.915
So there's going to be a
week off for the holiday for us

00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:26.960
here in the US.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.210
But don't forget, we're going
to kick back in the week

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.190
after that, the first
week of December.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.990
But wanted to wish all you
guys an amazing holiday.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.040
We'll see you all the
Thursday after that,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.330
and look forward to
picking it up from there.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.590
Laura, you had some
announcements to make.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.390
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.450
LAURA: Why, yes I do.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.430
So this one has been
a long time coming.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.060
Me and Liam have been
very excited about this

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.850
for a very long time, by
our very own Babs Tarr.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.890
LAURA: This is the
Chastity's Nook presents--

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.020
LAURA: --the Exandrian Calendar.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.960
Now I feel like I should point
this out to you that it's not

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.820
an actual workable calendar.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.520
It is the Exandrian
calendar, so it's

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.175
pretty much just like a
useless object that you hang.

00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:13.293
TALIESIN: It works in Exandria.
MARISHA: Blasphemy!

00:07:13.293 --> 00:07:14.460
MATT: It does actually work.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.960
LAURA: It does in Exandria, and
you can follow along and see

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.170
when things are, like you
know, certain dates that

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.970
are important.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.560
There's holidays in here.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.360
It's pretty awesome.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.600
SAM: Couldn't you put
some Post-its on it

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.382
and make it work?
LAURA: You could put Post-it--

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:27.285
TALIESIN: Well, no,
because it's got its own--

00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:28.727
LAURA: I feel like
I should sneak peek.

00:07:28.727 --> 00:07:30.185
Should I sneak peak
one other page?

00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:31.185
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:32.727
LIAM: Just one extra,
just one extra.

00:07:32.727 --> 00:07:34.519
LAURA: Are you okay with
me showing this one?

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:35.894
TALIESIN: Oh my
god, yes, please.

00:07:35.894 --> 00:07:39.539
LAURA: So this is
the pinup of Molly.

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:40.951
TALIESIN: I have been
waiting for this.

00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:42.543
LAURA: I don't know
if you guys can see this.

00:07:42.543 --> 00:07:43.308
There's a
little Caduceus--

00:07:43.308 --> 00:07:45.240
TALIESIN: Caduceus teapot.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.040
MATT: It's so good.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.815
LIAM: Do you spice?

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.870
LAURA: Is that how you say that?

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.704
MATT: Rucinda, yeah.

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:51.680
LAURA: Rucinda.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.055
So yeah.
MARISHA: Plenty of uses.

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.321
SAM: All of the images are
as tantalizing as that one?

00:07:55.321 --> 00:07:56.280
LAURA: Oh they're good!

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.590
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, if not more.
LAURA: I can't show you more.

00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:02.150
But the other cool thing
is that all of the pages

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.253
are perforated, so you can
tear them out and frame them.

00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:05.489
They're perfectly sized

00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:06.500
so you can just
put them in a frame.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.000
LIAM: Just put them
on your ceiling.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.209
LAURA: You just put them on--

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:10.700
(laughter)

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.500
Wherever you want.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.500
TRAVIS: Babs is so good.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.833
LAURA: So yeah, Babs is amazing.

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:15.375
TALIESIN: She's been
working very hard.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:16.830
LAURA: So that's pretty awesome.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.740
And then the other thing that
we have in the store right now

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.970
is our Whitestone dice set.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.340
(laughter)

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.010
So like, you can go
look at them. I think

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.460
they're showing them right now.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.632
They come in this really
beautiful little case

00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:33.049
that we were really
excited about.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.974
Because if you take off the
lid, it works as a dice tray!

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:38.414
TRAVIS: And it's like a
furry case, it's all soft--

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:40.039
LAURA: Yeah, it's
velvety and fabulous,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.130
and it's got the
Whitestone crest on it.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.725
And yeah, so they look like
they're made of Whitestone,

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:47.380
which I'm very excited about.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.560
Yeah.
So there you go.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.720
SAM: Wow!
MATT: That's awesome.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.530
SAM: It's amazing.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.322
LAURA: And they're both
available in the US

00:08:53.322 --> 00:08:54.690
and the UK right now.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.708
(cheering)

00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:58.750
TRAVIS: They're gorgeous.
MARISHA: They're awesome.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.640
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.142
I believe--
TRAVIS: Oh my god, no way.

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:03.942
There's got to be more.

00:09:03.942 --> 00:09:05.690
MATT: I believe that's the
end of our announcements,

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.490
which means we--

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.352
MARISHA: No, there's like--
MATT: You get to jump into--

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:09.607
MARISHA: --Christmas
is on December 25th.

00:09:09.607 --> 00:09:11.157
MATT: Tonight's episode--
MARISHA: Don't forget--

00:09:11.157 --> 00:09:13.365
SAM: Don't forget to watch the
Darrington Brigade

00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:15.300
SAM: --next Friday night.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.810
LIAM: Love each other!

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.240
MARISHA: New episode
of Mini Primetime.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.240
(laughter)

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.296
LAURA: Yeah, right?
TALIESIN: Fuck!

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:23.260
MATT: This episode of--
LAURA: That's a good one.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.052
TALIESIN: Goddamn!
MATT: --Critical Role.

00:09:25.052 --> 00:09:26.925
(cheering)

00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:34.746
(water bubbling)
(thunder rumbling)

00:09:34.746 --> 00:09:36.837
(explosion)

00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:38.545
Role! Critical, Critical

00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:40.831
Role! Critical, Critical

00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:42.857
Role! Critical, Critical

00:09:43.214 --> 00:09:44.759
Role! Critical, Critical

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:48.447
Role! Mighty Nein, Mighty Nein

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:50.974
Roll the dice

00:09:50.974 --> 00:09:53.372
Roll the dice, dice, dice

00:09:53.372 --> 00:09:55.687
(singing) The adventure begins.

00:09:55.687 --> 00:09:59.859
They were always beside you,
your nerdy best friends,

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:01.855
and the DM to guide you.

00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:06.257
And they rise from the
flames for the battles ahead.

00:10:06.257 --> 00:10:10.338
Villains beware, 'cause
you're about to be dead.

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:14.020
(dramatic music)

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.565
They got magic and flair.

00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:18.821
They got falchions and cunning.

00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:22.982
They don't see over there,
there's a monster incoming.

00:10:22.982 --> 00:10:27.116
Inspiration is waiting,
rise up, don't think twice.

00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:30.909
Put your fate in your hands,
take a chance, roll the dice.

00:10:30.909 --> 00:10:33.776
Roll the dice.
Role! Critical, Critical

00:10:33.776 --> 00:10:35.590
Role! Critical, Critical

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.041
Role! Critical, Critical

00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:39.815
Role! Critical

00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:41.775
Can you answer the call?

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:46.141
Dig in deep in your soul,
as the legend unfolds,

00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.825
now it's your turn,
your turn, your turn

00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:55.101
to roll!

00:10:55.101 --> 00:10:59.301
(fire burning)

00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:02.093
(dragon roaring)

00:11:03.101 --> 00:11:04.451
MATT: Welcome back.

00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:05.410
Late on the draw there.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.210
TALIESIN: I know.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.750
MATT: So let’s get some
proper music for this.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:18.066
Last we left off, the Mighty
Nein-- goddamn it, Sam.

00:11:18.066 --> 00:11:20.331
(laughter)

00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:21.410
LAURA: This is new.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.210
Is this new?

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.630
SAM: Well, last
last time around,

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.220
I wore a different Matt shirt.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.430
TRAVIS: That music matches
with that Hot Pepper Gaming face.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.820
SAM: So I just changed.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.070
I changed the Matt shirt,
but it's still a Matt shirt.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.987
LAURA: You can see the
sweat on the upper lip.

00:11:33.987 --> 00:11:34.835
(laughter)

00:11:34.835 --> 00:11:36.210
MATT: I'm going
to remember that.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.010
(laughter)

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.650
TRAVIS: Yeah, not the
night to do it on.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.483
MATT: No, it is not.

00:11:39.483 --> 00:11:40.780
It is not the night to do that.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.860
LIAM: The day that
Taryon Darrington fell.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.830
MATT: So the Mighty Nein for
quite some time have been

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.640
chasing the tracks of
the Angel of Irons,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.110
a somewhat new and esoteric
cult that only whispers

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.020
have been discovered about
them, and what their plot was.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.480
You came to uncover
that the Angel of Irons

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.000
was a cover to trick these
other people and cultists

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.510
into helping the
Chained Oblivion,

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:14.270
Tharizdun, begin to unravel
its bindings deep in the abyss.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.190
And chasing Obann, who had
gathered three figures to what

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.020
he referred to as his
family, your companion, Yasha,

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:27.000
the Laughing Hand, a terrible
undying champion of Torog,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.900
and the Inevitable End,
the Caedogeist, Jourrael.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.400
All three of them
bound to his will,

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.410
he carried them across
Exandria, gathering

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.690
things necessary to see
this plot to fruition.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.240
Your last scry
spell revealing them

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.040
arriving in the capital city
of Rexxentrum, in Wildemount.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.850
It seemed at this time that
Vence, another cultist,

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.140
had delivered some scrolls
and information to a cathedral

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.610
deep in the city.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.660
And whispers of a rather imminent moment.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.470
So rushing your way to
Rexxentrum, asking for aid,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.660
you come to the rainy city,
dark storm clouds overhead.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.330
You try and look for any sort
of sign of where this cathedral

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.270
might be, and upon
arriving, finding out

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.530
that the city is seemingly
under attack at the same time

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.300
by Kryn operatives.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.560
You hear what sounds like din
of battle in the distance,

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.140
though you've seen
none directly.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.260
Is it just chaos to distract?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.710
Who knows?

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.090
But you've gathered yourselves
an ally, Pumat Sol, who

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.860
has come along with you
to deal with this scenario

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.970
after he was attacked along
with you in his house in Zadash.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.840
And you've stepped out
from the Rexxentrum Archive

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.820
of the Cobalt Soul into the
wet, slick cobblestone streets

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.085
of the city, heading eastward
towards the base of the Shimmer

00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:52.710
Ward, where it is believed this
cathedral, known as the Chantry

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.320
of the Dawn, stands.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:03.590
So Mighty Nein, as you step
out into the air above,

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.650
you can hear the heavy
elements of rain coming down

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.240
from above, which I can do
here with stuff, which is fun,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.070
with music.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.580
Pushing through, you can see
the streets are seemingly

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.110
deserted by most civilians.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.590
The few you see run confused,
some of them out of curiosity,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.010
others out of fear.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.370
Crownsguard occasionally attempt
to keep the peace among them.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.370
You hear quick
rumors and demands

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.970
for information from the crowd
to the Guard, and none of them

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:31.770
respond,

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.354
continuing to push
them into their homes

00:14:33.354 --> 00:14:35.180
or push them out of the way.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.371
You can hear shouts from
congested neighborhoods

00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:39.830
at the peripheral of your watch
as you go from intersection

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.372
to intersection,
heading east, deeper

00:14:41.372 --> 00:14:44.840
into the city, the tall
roofs and climbing spires

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.990
of the various
buildings that surround

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.740
and frame your continued
travel looming atop,

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.678
just almost cutting
out the gray sky above.

00:14:55.678 --> 00:14:58.220
You can see ahead a group about
30 or so Righteous Brand that

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.820
rushed past you northwards
toward the Platinum Veranda,

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.740
where you can hear
muffled shouts

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.930
and a chaotic echo of battle.

00:15:08.915 --> 00:15:10.290
Is there anything
you want to do?

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.168
Continue traveling eastward?

00:15:11.168 --> 00:15:13.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, we fucking
go towards the fray, right?

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.290
MATT: Okay.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.343
SAM: Well, wait--
towards the fray?

00:15:15.343 --> 00:15:17.553
I thought last time there was--
MARISHA: --to the chantry.

00:15:17.553 --> 00:15:19.220
MATT: The fray you
hear is to the north.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.137
You guys were heading
eastward to the chantry.

00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:24.465
SAM: Because that's where we saw
them doing some sort of ritual

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:25.520
in this cathedral.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.320
LAURA: Yeah, we’ve got
to go to the cathedral.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.370
TRAVIS: No, can't be
distracted, you're right

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.287
LAURA: The cathedral.

00:15:28.287 --> 00:15:30.079
MATT: Your last glance
you saw, there was--

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:33.140
of the storm clouds above
us, a tiny sliver of light

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.331
had broken through that
framed the chantry.

00:15:36.331 --> 00:15:38.595
SAM: And you just said something
about the Platinum something?

00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:40.220
MATT: The Platinum
Veranda's a location

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.220
in the city that's northward.
MARISHA: Platinum...?

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.855
SAM: Oh, okay, so we're
not going that way.

00:15:43.855 --> 00:15:45.057
We're going--
TRAVIS: We're going east.

00:15:45.057 --> 00:15:45.890
LIAM: Platinum Veranda.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.432
TALIESIN: And we
have we have alerted

00:15:47.432 --> 00:15:49.560
everyone we can
possibly think of that

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.130
the real target is to the east?

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.380
TRAVIS: No, we haven't, but
we also don't belong here.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.801
MATT: You mentioned what you've
learned briefly to the Cobalt

00:15:58.801 --> 00:15:59.760
Soul before you exited.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760
LAURA: That's important.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.600
TALIESIN: And did
we tell them to send

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.030
word to all of our people?

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.830
LAURA: Yes.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:09.524
We told them to send
word to Allura, and to--

00:16:09.524 --> 00:16:10.895
SAM: To Allura?

00:16:10.895 --> 00:16:12.440
LAURA: Yeah, the
Tal'Dorei Council.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.940
TRAVIS: But we just
said Rexxentrum.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.270
We didn't say where, right?

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.290
LIAM: The Shimmer Wards?

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.535
Where did we touch down?

00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:19.485
MATT: No, you guys touched
down in the Tangles.

00:16:19.485 --> 00:16:20.360
It's the larger area.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.360
The specific area is
called the Court of Colors.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.825
LIAM: Ah, okay.

00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:26.000
MATT: You being the only
person who's been here,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.965
you know loosely the
layout of the city.

00:16:27.965 --> 00:16:29.465
And you are the one
who has the map,

00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:33.216
so you have to guide if
anything gets more scattered.

00:16:33.216 --> 00:16:34.091
LAURA: I could do it.

00:16:34.091 --> 00:16:36.790
It would use up a spell slot,
but I could send a word to him.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:41.150
SAM: Every block that we go
on, I turn to Caleb and say,

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.060
did you live here?

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.300
Did you live on this block?

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.905
LIAM: I didn't, I didn't, no.

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:48.890
SAM: Did you ever do
anything on this block?

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.975
Is this like, where your
school was, or anything?

00:16:50.975 --> 00:16:54.410
LIAM: Caleb's eyes are
darting everywhere,

00:16:54.410 --> 00:17:01.245
and he's at the head of the pack
leading us towards the chantry,

00:17:01.245 --> 00:17:02.185
which I haven't seen.

00:17:02.185 --> 00:17:05.568
MATT: Make a perception
check, if you don't mind.

00:17:05.568 --> 00:17:08.010
LAURA: Is the light still
shining down on it from above?

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:08.810
MATT: It is.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.720
It's flickering in and
out, like the clouds

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.390
are closing
past, and it breaks

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.515
through every now and then.

00:17:13.515 --> 00:17:16.184
But it's like a singular ray.

00:17:16.184 --> 00:17:17.359
LIAM: 15.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.810
MATT: 15?

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.869
Your eyes train on the
rising walkways and towers

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.060
of the Soltryce Academy
that are peeking

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.712
over the walls of
the Shimmer Ward

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.421
that you can just make
out on the horizon

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.310
as you pass by a
series of buildings

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.727
where the roofs are a bit lower
than the other ones you've

00:17:31.727 --> 00:17:33.780
been rushing by.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.430
You can see pale yellow walls
that surround the Shimmer

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.840
Ward of the capital.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.790
You begin to approach the
exterior of the Vigil Circle,

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.890
which is a region
between where you are

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.290
and your destination,
as noted by the network

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.240
of ring-like streets that
denote the circular marketplace,

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.720
some varied shops, and
industries that normally fill

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.755
this area, as well as the
mini-fortress of gray rock

00:17:55.755 --> 00:17:56.880
known as the Tower of Writ.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.010
But everything is closed.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.885
Everything is shut down.

00:18:00.885 --> 00:18:02.260
LIAM: What was
the Tower of Writ?

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.885
That's not something
I'm familiar with.

00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:06.816
MATT: It's the central temple
to Erathis within the city.

00:18:06.816 --> 00:18:10.110
It is not like the
cathedral that you

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.710
had seen within your vision.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.500
Two more larger bands of
Righteous Brand soldiers

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.380
begin shouting, (yelling)
"Oh, over here!"

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.393
They run past, and cross your path,

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.310
and continue heading
northward, also seemingly

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.822
to join the rest northward.

00:18:24.822 --> 00:18:26.531
LAURA: Should we tell
them that there's--

00:18:26.531 --> 00:18:28.840
TRAVIS: They're not
going to believe us.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.340
SAM: Also, do we want them to--

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.820
I mean, the Kryn are
attacking, right?

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.740
MARISHA: We'd waste
time trying to explain.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.135
SAM: But why on earth would we
want them to go kill the Kryn?

00:18:42.135 --> 00:18:45.751
MARISHA: Well, we're
supposed to just stop and try

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.835
and convince them to stop?

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.530
LAURA: We just
need to keep going.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.280
We're saying all this
is as we're running.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.710
MATT: You continue to rush
down the street ahead of you.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.294
It splits
at one point to

00:18:58.294 --> 00:19:01.388
go into one of the circular
regions in the marketplace.

00:19:01.388 --> 00:19:03.092
You know, probably the
shortest to the northward,

00:19:03.092 --> 00:19:04.800
and you just pick that
because it's close

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.092
the direction you're traveling.

00:19:06.092 --> 00:19:09.270
When you head a ways down
before three Crownsguard

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.365
come around the corner, and
their hurried gait shifting

00:19:12.365 --> 00:19:14.740
in your direction, they raise
their hand, and one of them

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.250
goes, (yelling) "Please
return to your homes!

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.883
"We've everything under control."

00:19:18.883 --> 00:19:21.240
LAURA: Yeah, our
home is that way.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.580
LIAM: We are out of sorts.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.780
We've a ways to go still.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.910
MATT: "Then hurry up."

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.750
You notice it first.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.590
SAM: Huh?

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.522
MATT: This faint vibration
in the ground beneath you.

00:19:31.522 --> 00:19:33.053
TALIESIN: Everyone get ready.

00:19:33.053 --> 00:19:34.853
MATT: You have just enough
time to look to Caduceus,

00:19:34.853 --> 00:19:36.520
as he says this before
you begin to feel

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.820
the ground (rumbling).

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.820
MARISHA: Is it familiar?

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.010
LIAM: I cast Fly on myself.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.260
MATT: You cast Fly on yourself?

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.570
MARISHA: Is it familiar to the
purple worms we felt before?

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.610
MATT: You have that
thought, and go, holy shit,

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.364
this feels like a
purple (whooshing).

00:19:49.364 --> 00:19:50.250
(laughter)

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.330
Punching out of the ground about
15 feet from where you stand,

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.310
sending one of the
Crownsguard

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.500
thrown from where he was
standing about 15 feet,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.110
tumbling across the
slick cobblestone.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.570
Bits of stone and earth go
flying everywhere as you see,

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.690
piercing under the
ground, rising up,

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.570
the gargantuan twisting form
of an angry purple worm,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.040
its body covered
in its signature

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.590
hard dark purple
scales, with spines

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.810
piercing through each
area where they meet.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.620
You can see the rows
of teeth as it roars.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.360
In the sky and on
its back, you can

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.920
see chains and bits
a metal that are

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.750
put across them like barding.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.950
And holding on to it, you can
see three Kryn soldiers that

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:33.360
immediately leap off onto
the ground, facing not you,

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.565
but facing the Crownsguard.

00:20:34.565 --> 00:20:36.440
And you can see one of
the Crownsguard tumble

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.606
to the ground and
(gasping) pulling back.

00:20:38.606 --> 00:20:40.150
And the other two are
pulling their weapons,

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.127
and they're shaking.

00:20:41.127 --> 00:20:42.156
What do you guys do?
SAM: Do we stop this?

00:20:42.156 --> 00:20:43.792
MARISHA: How many
attacks are confirmed?

00:20:43.792 --> 00:20:44.590
No, we--

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.022
LAURA: Do we just let
them go?

00:20:46.022 --> 00:20:47.564
Do we just let them go!?
MARISHA: I say we keep going.

00:20:47.564 --> 00:20:49.310
TRAVIS: I think we do, too.
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.185
Be careful, you guys!

00:20:50.185 --> 00:20:51.680
Don't get hurt too bad.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.860
MATT: As you say
that, one of them

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.145
turns and looks at your group.

00:20:56.145 --> 00:20:59.115
And this-- (whistle)
and the worm

00:20:59.115 --> 00:21:02.780
then turns its head
in your direction.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.040
So you guys-- are you
continuing to run?

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.335
LAURA: Should we just
try to keep running?

00:21:07.335 --> 00:21:08.710
TALIESIN: Let's
see if we maybe--

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.897
LAURA: Maybe we
can bring the worm,

00:21:09.897 --> 00:21:11.616
and it'll bust through
under the chantry.

00:21:11.616 --> 00:21:12.416
It would be good.

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:15.190
LIAM: We don't know
how much longer--

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.990
LAURA: Running.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.860
LIAM: Yeah, we just keep going.
SAM: Just keep going.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.660
MARISHA: Running.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.590
SAM: It's not our fight, right?

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.660
TRAVIS: Not yet, not
if we can help it.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.580
SAM: I don't even know
who I'm rooting for.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.515
TRAVIS: No, I don't either.

00:21:26.515 --> 00:21:29.380
LIAM: Caduceus just asked how
far we are from the chantry.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.340
Would I know that?

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.330
MATT: You would know you're
probably about, I'd say,

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.750
depending on--

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.840
with it being pretty
empty, maybe seven minutes.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.921
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to
cast Locate Creature for Yasha.

00:21:40.921 --> 00:21:42.380
MATT: Okay, what's
the range on that?

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.290
TALIESIN: 1,000 feet,
but it lasts an hour.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.770
MATT: Okay, there you go.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:46.847
So keep that mind.

00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:48.430
You guys continue to run?
LAURA: Yeah!

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.570
MATT: All right.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.170
The Kryn soldier that
jumped off and noticed

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.945
you when you shouted is now
giving a run in your direction.

00:21:55.945 --> 00:21:57.372
LAURA: Why?!

00:21:57.372 --> 00:21:59.081
MATT: Because they're
attacking the city.

00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:00.940
(laughter)

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.226
And the purple worm
immediately (rumbling).

00:22:03.226 --> 00:22:04.026
SAM: Oh no!

00:22:04.026 --> 00:22:04.840
MATT: --burrows
under the ground.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.640
LAURA: Oh no.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.210
SAM: Oh no, they're going to
pop up again, aren't they?

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.200
MATT: You hear a few
other screams,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.218
as it seems the
two Crownsguard--

00:22:13.218 --> 00:22:15.510
actually, it would be all
three of them at this point--

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.723
are dispatched one after
another by three Kryn soldiers.

00:22:19.723 --> 00:22:20.890
MARISHA: Damn, they're good.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.307
TRAVIS: We're going
to feel dirty,

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:24.256
no matter how this plays out.

00:22:24.256 --> 00:22:26.470
MATT: The one that's
chasing you is then behind,

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.180
you can see the other two
are now rushing up to join.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:29.980
No worm in sight,
you keep running.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.162
LAURA: Should we show them
the symbol of the Bright--

00:22:31.162 --> 00:22:32.773
MATT: And you keep running.
And you keep running.

00:22:32.773 --> 00:22:34.288
LIAM: No, we just keep
moving.

00:22:34.288 --> 00:22:35.830
MATT: Yeah, they're
all following you

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.248
guys, because you're
the other marks--

00:22:37.248 --> 00:22:39.040
they dispatched the
Crownsguard easy enough.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.790
TRAVIS: I will stop,
and I'll turn around,

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.832
and I'll pull out our
symbol of the Bright Queen,

00:22:42.832 --> 00:22:46.291
and I'll run up and I'll say,
stop! Leave us be, we have

00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:47.500
business at the Bright Queen.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.015
Back at your post.

00:22:49.015 --> 00:22:52.288
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:53.829
SAM: No one else
can see this, right?

00:22:53.829 --> 00:22:54.311
It's just--

00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:56.228
LAURA: Yeah, we're
keeping our (murmuring).

00:22:56.228 --> 00:22:57.410
SAM: There’s no guards--

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.210
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.040
TRAVIS: 23.
MARISHA: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.870
MATT: 23?

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.453
LAURA: Yes!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:23:02.453 --> 00:23:04.326
TALIESIN: Perception
check 27, by the way.

00:23:04.326 --> 00:23:05.185
MATT: 27, okay.

00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:06.310
You guys are keeping watch.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.590
I mean, there are
guards running through.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:13.240
There is one that turns, and
just sees the purple worm,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.910
which by the way, as you're
having this conversation,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.570
about 10 feet from
you (slamming sound).

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.160
Slamming out of the
ground, showering

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.928
you with bits of rock and dirt.

00:23:22.928 --> 00:23:24.970
At that point, the guard
turns, sees it, and just

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.730
fucking bolts the other way.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.800
The first soldier
comes, weapon drawn,

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.200
and as you're holding
up the symbol, rushes.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.680
And you can see his form shift
as a shadow version of himself

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.640
splits, and
flanks around you.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.440
LAURA: Whoa, yes.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.750
MATT: You've seen this
once before in the sewers

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.630
of Zadash long go.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:42.970
TRAVIS: God, so long ago.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.429
MATT: And as it rushes towards
you, and you hold the symbol

00:23:45.429 --> 00:23:49.390
and say this, it falters,
and then stands and looks.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.890
And you see it
caught in the moment.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.322
The two other ones catch up.

00:23:52.322 --> 00:23:54.281
You can see they both
have their weapons drawn,

00:23:54.281 --> 00:23:56.020
and they see you stopping.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.721
And they look taken aback
by what you're holding,

00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:01.930
and the fact that the one
who was guiding this charge

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.270
has stopped. His weapon
goes slack a bit.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.520
TRAVIS: I hold it up.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.840
I slide it beneath my armor.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.510
Hurry.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.650
I'll head back.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.090
MATT: He turns back and says
something in Undercommon,

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.370
and the purple worm, which
is currently in a holding

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.245
position, looking at
them and looking at you,

00:24:17.245 --> 00:24:19.000
begins to turn in
your direction,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.560
and gives a shout
out-- do any of you

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.462
guys understand Undercommon?

00:24:22.462 --> 00:24:23.314
LIAM: No.

00:24:23.314 --> 00:24:24.890
SAM: I've got Overcommon.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:25.740
MATT: No, no.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.800
It's like,
(speaking Undercommon). And

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.020
the purple worm
turns back to him,

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.260
and then they all leap onto its
back, and then it (whooshing)

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.008
burrows back into the ground.

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:38.300
There went that encounter.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.150
(cheering)

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.916
TRAVIS: Remember that.

00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:45.326
LIAM: Muad'dib.

00:24:45.326 --> 00:24:52.290
MATT: Continuing on, you
begin to see that ray of sun

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.050
is your beacon, bringing
you closer and closer,

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.760
you guiding this charge.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.820
You hear more shouts, you hear
an explosion in the distance,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.450
just a muffled
echo across the city,

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.400
uncertain of necessarily
the direction

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.570
or the intensity of it.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.916
That's when you also
hear the (singing) bong.

00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:13.250
TRAVIS: The fucking bells.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.200
They're ringing
the fucking bells.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.773
MATT: (singing) Bong.

00:25:16.773 --> 00:25:18.182
LAURA: Or the war bells.
MARISHA: An attack on them.

00:25:18.182 --> 00:25:19.640
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: (singing) Bong.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.326
MARISHA: Alarming the city.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.645
MATT: (singing) Bong.

00:25:23.645 --> 00:25:25.370
SAM: Oh, maybe it's
just like 12:00.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.658
LIAM: Is it a sound
that I've ever heard?

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:28.381
MATT: This is a sound
that you've not heard,

00:25:28.381 --> 00:25:30.308
but you are aware that
throughout the city,

00:25:30.308 --> 00:25:34.790
there are bells set everywhere
for the purposes of alerting

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.140
everybody who may not be aware.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.420
That it's not just
there's a problem.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.033
This is danger,
we're under attack.

00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:41.450
And so now this
has been declared,

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.490
and you hear (bonging).

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.140
MARISHA: Careful, there's about
to be full-on pandemonium.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.025
MATT: Just echoing
across the city.

00:25:49.025 --> 00:25:51.843
MARISHA: Let's all stay close.

00:25:51.843 --> 00:25:53.510
This is when people
could start to riot.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.590
LIAM: We just have to
cut through it quickly.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.465
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:25:56.465 --> 00:25:58.890
MATT: Rain-slicked,
soaked to the bone,

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:02.270
you all rush around
one of the large--

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.860
large military
structures on this corner

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.303
here that is small for
like a large stronghold.

00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:10.910
But it's a place here.
(laughter)

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:11.990
Medium.
SAM: Yeah.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.573
MATT: We'll go with that one.

00:26:13.573 --> 00:26:16.535
You know what I mean.

00:26:16.535 --> 00:26:21.470
To see what you recognize
as the Chantry of the Dawn.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.560
It is a massive cathedral, and
you're immediately taken aback

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.520
by the beautiful masonry and
sculpture work that comprises

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.400
this opulent structure that
stands before you.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.270
High-reaching stone arches
that are housing towering

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.940
stained glass windows
that depict various stages

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.310
of the sun in the sky.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.310
Statues of ten-foot
tall armored soldiers

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.458
are set into pillars,
like celestial guardians.

00:26:46.458 --> 00:26:48.500
And you can see there it
goes up multiple stories

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.630
that climb into this
great spire that

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.270
climbs into the raining sky.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.740
Every square foot
of the exterior

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.190
is tailored with subtle
carvings of vines

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.040
and leaves framing
the powerful supports,

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.580
all reaching upward towards
the stretching rays of the sun

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.380
upon each of these depictions.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.870
(singing) Bong, bong, da-dong.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.180
The bells still going
off in the area.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:16.970
You come to the 15-foot tall
doors the front of the chantry.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:18.580
LAURA: Should we go in?

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.329
TALIESIN: Am I
feeling anything yet?

00:27:21.329 --> 00:27:22.220
MATT: Feeling anything
Yes, you are.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.643
(gasping)

00:27:23.643 --> 00:27:25.545
TALIESIN: She's here.
LAURA: She's here?

00:27:25.545 --> 00:27:26.659
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: She's here?

00:27:26.659 --> 00:27:27.410
TALIESIN: I should
be able to also

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.810
pinpoint what direction she is
from us, and if she's moving.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:32.920
MATT: She is moving.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.030
She is within and below.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:35.926
LAURA: Oh god!

00:27:35.926 --> 00:27:37.856
Oh god, we're going
to fight them all?

00:27:37.858 --> 00:27:38.940
LAURA: Oh god, I'm gonna throw up.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.907
TALIESIN: They're on the move.

00:27:39.907 --> 00:27:41.990
LIAM: Is anyone or
anything watching

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.930
this entrance that we can tell?

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.758
MATT: From the outside, no.

00:27:46.758 --> 00:27:48.992
TRAVIS: Ah, ha, ha!

00:27:48.992 --> 00:27:50.160
MARISHA: All right.
All right.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.030
SAM: It's time to
fucking kill Yasha.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.970
LAURA: No.
No!

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:53.940
SAM: Let’s do it!

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.458
LAURA: No, we're
going to save her.

00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:56.466
MARISHA: Are we going
to bust through here,

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:58.778
or do we want to try
and do a perimeter run?

00:27:58.778 --> 00:27:59.769
TRAVIS: Alternate, yeah.

00:27:59.769 --> 00:28:02.082
If people are expecting
pressure to come through,

00:28:02.082 --> 00:28:05.508
we should try and find a
more subversive way in.

00:28:05.508 --> 00:28:06.950
LIAM: Is there
anything on this door?

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.648
SAM: Sure, I'll go
check, just in case,

00:28:08.648 --> 00:28:10.190
while you figure
out a side entrance.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.212
MARISHA: Does it look
like-- how big is--

00:28:11.212 --> 00:28:12.335
TRAVIS: You go
left, I'll go right.

00:28:12.335 --> 00:28:14.180
MARISHA: Deal.
SAM: I'm checking for traps.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.040
MARISHA: Run.
MATT: Go for it.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.050
SAM: Terrible.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.120
19.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.300
MATT: 19.
LIAM: Pretty good.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.790
MATT: You don't sense any traps,
but it is definitely locked.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.880
And it's like a big lock, like
the key you imagine probably

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.225
is about that long, and
the metal is very thick.

00:28:28.225 --> 00:28:30.350
Mind you, you've dealt with
locks like that before.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.240
But just as a note,
it is a larger lock.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.555
SAM: I will start unlocking
it while they're scouting.

00:28:34.555 --> 00:28:36.305
TRAVIS: She breaks
left, I'll break right.

00:28:36.305 --> 00:28:37.673
MATT: All right, as you
guys turn the corner,

00:28:37.673 --> 00:28:40.269
you can see there's some small
windows in the sides of what's

00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:43.160
almost like an entry
way, almost like a foyer

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.950
to the entire chantry.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.371
The building then
opens up into what

00:28:48.371 --> 00:28:50.330
would be considered the
main church-like center

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.720
of the cathedral.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.930
This is where it grows
into the spire above.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.742
And you can see on the
outside, the windows begin--

00:28:57.742 --> 00:28:59.701
again, like the ones you
saw in the beginning--

00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:02.870
the stained glass
rises up for 40 feet,

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.650
with beautiful color patterns of stars

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:10.770
that frame the sun
in different visual bits

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:11.570
of splendor.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.840
And a bit of warm light is now
coming down into this area,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.250
hitting the stained glass.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.680
The rain stops, as you
curl around the side,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.639
and find a small pocket
where the storm doesn't

00:29:20.639 --> 00:29:23.240
seem to be affecting you.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.950
You come around the
back side, and it's

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.200
just almost solid stained
glass on the back end,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.225
except for the stone arches that
hold the entire structure up.

00:29:30.225 --> 00:29:32.100
TRAVIS: Any of those
windows that we passed--

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.100
are we able to slide up and
just put one eye over the corner

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.900
and peer in?

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.192
MATT: The windows you see
are actually about eight feet

00:29:39.192 --> 00:29:42.618
off the ground, and they're
circular, with a stained glass

00:29:42.618 --> 00:29:43.660
window pane put in there.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.244
LAURA: I'm going to
take my paint out.

00:29:45.244 --> 00:29:47.460
I'm going to paint a
little hole in the wall,

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.350
so we can get a peephole.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.055
LIAM: Last time we tried to break
into the church of Pelor

00:29:52.055 --> 00:29:52.855
it didn't go so well.

00:29:52.855 --> 00:29:54.482
TRAVIS: One of the
sides of the door?

00:29:54.482 --> 00:29:55.338
TALIESIN: That's true.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:55.338 --> 00:29:56.562
MATT: For the front
door, you mean?

00:29:56.562 --> 00:29:58.492
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah. The temple of Pelor.

00:29:58.492 --> 00:30:00.222
MATT: Make a perception
check with disadvantage.

00:30:00.222 --> 00:30:02.659
SAM: I'm also just picking
the lock, not opening it.

00:30:02.659 --> 00:30:03.700
LAURA: Oh, guide me!

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.090
SAM: Also 19.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:07.890
19.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.210
LAURA: A 20.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.010
MATT: 20?

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.702
Okay, 19.

00:30:11.702 --> 00:30:13.210
SAM: It's a big lock.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.710
MATT: It's a big
lock, and it's more

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:15.880
intricate than you expected.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.950
The door does not open.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.200
MARISHA: When I'm doing
the perimeter run,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.780
are there any cellar
entrances, anything that looks

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.520
like hatches that go down?

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.070
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.090
You're glancing through.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.560
You look inside, and you
can see some candelabras

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.360
that are arranged.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.150
There's a raised platform with
a bit of a red carpet on it.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.420
It looks to be a desk or some
sort of a wide, beautifully

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.510
carved table that's meant
for greeting people who

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.980
enter the chantry.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.440
You do see two
figures that stand

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.000
at the top of that platform.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.510
And they're both in the process
of looking through

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.630
drawers or papers there.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.130
They both look to one side, as
if they're hearing something.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.010
And you can hear very faintly
a little bit of voices

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.380
coming through the hole.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.503
And then one of
them gets

00:31:00.503 --> 00:31:02.170
out of your perspective
of the peephole,

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.128
and that's all you see.

00:31:03.128 --> 00:31:05.170
LAURA: What did that people
look like that were--

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:09.160
MATT: They are heavily
cloaked, wearing

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.280
a piece of cloth across the front of the face.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.840
The hood and cloak
they're wearing

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.910
is a dark gray color.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.948
Generally meant to look
inconspicuous, but also to hide

00:31:18.948 --> 00:31:20.740
any sort of representation
of who they are.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.880
LAURA: There are people in
there rifling through things.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.460
LIAM: I'm going to throw my
back away from the temple,

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.730
and squat down and
pull out the pearl,

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.390
and place it to my
forehead and cast

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.360
Fortune's Favor upon myself,
hidden under my cloak.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.636
MATT: You got it.

00:31:35.636 --> 00:31:37.280
MARISHA: I rolled a 20 total.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.680
MATT: A 20 total?

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.720
You do a pass, and you're
looking for the same?

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.520
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.555
MATT: You need to roll
perception as well.

00:31:43.555 --> 00:31:44.643
TRAVIS: Good, 20.

00:31:44.643 --> 00:31:45.983
MATT: Okay, two 20s.

00:31:45.983 --> 00:31:47.650
You guys come around
the opposite sides,

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.354
and meet each other.
And you look about.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.930
There is no cellar.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.510
It looks like whatever
entrances there are here

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.731
are designed to be
either purely that front,

00:31:58.731 --> 00:31:59.531
or you haven't seen
where they are.

00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:01.780
TRAVIS: Fuck, a fucking fortress.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.822
SAM: (drawling) There's
no basement at the Alamo!

00:32:03.822 --> 00:32:04.650
MARISHA: All right.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.147
LIAM: You could turn
that peephole into a--

00:32:06.147 --> 00:32:07.973
MARISHA: Do we get around to
the back, and meet each other?

00:32:07.973 --> 00:32:09.373
MATT: Yeah, you guys meet
up on the opposite side

00:32:09.373 --> 00:32:11.040
after doing your scan.
TRAVIS: Anything?

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:11.840
MARISHA: No, you?

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.270
TRAVIS: Nothing at all?
MARISHA: No!

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.187
TRAVIS: The windows are
eight feet in the air!

00:32:15.187 --> 00:32:16.437
MARISHA: I can't fucking jump.

00:32:16.437 --> 00:32:19.585
MATT: A sheet of rain comes
through, as the beam of light

00:32:19.585 --> 00:32:20.710
gets partially interrupted.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.710
LAURA: Can I look through
the peephole and see--

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:26.710
is there any area of the chapel
that looks like it's hidden

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.900
behind pews, or maybe behind--

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.461
if I look at along
the walls, does it

00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:31.315
look like there's area--

00:32:31.315 --> 00:32:32.580
is it hidden behind
pillars, maybe?

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.375
MATT: From what
you can see-- you

00:32:33.375 --> 00:32:35.367
can only see the front chamber.

00:32:35.367 --> 00:32:37.353
You can't look into the
main cathedral room.

00:32:37.353 --> 00:32:38.770
It's only this antechamber

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:39.645
that you enter first.

00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:41.410
LAURA: Does it look
like it's blocked?

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.138
Is anybody looking
into this right now?

00:32:43.138 --> 00:32:44.680
MATT: From what you
can see, which is

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.980
just this little perspective--

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.480
you can see the center of the
room and that raised platform.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.130
Nobody sees you, but there are
people that are essentially

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:52.595
looking towards the front door.

00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:53.710
LAURA: Okay.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:57.250
If I moved along the
side, would I be able to--

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.953
I want to paint a little
crawl space to get in.

00:32:59.953 --> 00:33:00.870
MATT: You can do that.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.108
LAURA: But I want to do
it out of eyeshot of what

00:33:03.108 --> 00:33:04.399
I can see through the peephole.

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.233
TRAVIS: So terrible.

00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:06.400
SAM: What do you want to do?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.363
TRAVIS: The front door
is a fatal funnel.

00:33:08.363 --> 00:33:09.785
TALIESIN: Doggie door
on the other side.

00:33:09.785 --> 00:33:11.190
LAURA: I mean, I can
go along the side,

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.457
we can can go further along.
LIAM: Yeah, for sure, for sure.

00:33:13.457 --> 00:33:14.695
LAURA: Yeah, let's
go towards the back,

00:33:14.695 --> 00:33:16.070
and I'll do the
same thing there.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.870
MATT: Okay.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:17.778
MARISHA: We'll run
into them as we're--

00:33:17.778 --> 00:33:19.280
MATT: Okay, so are you guys
going with Jester then?

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.159
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Yes!

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:22.330
MATT: Okay, so you've all
gathered up on the right or left

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.247
side of the cathedral.

00:33:23.247 --> 00:33:24.140
TRAVIS: Call it.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.268
LAURA: Right.

00:33:25.268 --> 00:33:27.560
MATT: Okay, so you go on the
right side of the cathedral.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.520
You meet up with them.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.700
You come
around, Beauregard,

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.200
but you're pretty
quick on your feet

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.510
anyway, so you actually get
there about the same time.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.666
You all meet up
off to the right side

00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:37.750
and a little further back.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.125
You're at the cusp
where the wall

00:33:39.125 --> 00:33:42.070
would be that leads
into that main chamber

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.820
or into the cathedral.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.720
You can see there's like a
heavy wall that blocks the two.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.767
So if you're going
to make-- did you

00:33:47.767 --> 00:33:49.460
want to paint a crawl space?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.220
MATT: Where do you
want to paint it?

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.400
LAURA: Where do you think?

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.200
Which side?

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.540
Big side?

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.340
Front space?

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.696
SAM: Back side.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:55.696 --> 00:33:56.496
LAURA: Back side.

00:33:56.496 --> 00:33:59.172
MATT: So the large cathedral?

00:33:59.172 --> 00:34:00.490
SAM: Yeah, away from the door.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.110
LAURA: Where the people are?

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.610
MATT: The people you saw are
inside the antechamber.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:05.410
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, then yes.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.287
SAM: The main space.
LAURA: In the main space.

00:34:06.287 --> 00:34:07.697
TRAVIS: You want to
go deep, but yeah.

00:34:07.697 --> 00:34:08.497
SAM: Away from here?

00:34:08.497 --> 00:34:10.385
MATT: Here, I'll give
you a visual perspective.

00:34:10.385 --> 00:34:11.185
(cheering)

00:34:11.185 --> 00:34:12.719
TRAVIS: I love that segue!

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.320
LAURA: That's how I want it!

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.601
TRAVIS: How about a
visual perspective?

00:34:16.601 --> 00:34:18.190
TALIESIN: Visual aids!

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.320
SAM: This visual perspective
is brought to you

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.780
by Dwarven Forge Combat Cam.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.730
They will be at PAX Unplugged
over the first weekend

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.530
in December.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:30.060
Go say hi at the
Die Hard Dice booth,

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.715
and follow along on social,
@dwarvenforge on Twitter.

00:34:33.715 --> 00:34:35.215
LAURA: Also an
awesome dice company.

00:34:35.215 --> 00:34:36.975
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:34:36.975 --> 00:34:39.820
MATT: You guys were
in this front area.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.270
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.870
MATT: You have made
a peephole here,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.620
which means you're
able to look in and see

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.204
this area with the
desk and the raised

00:34:46.204 --> 00:34:47.650
platform and the candelabra.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:53.949
So you saw two figures up here
are going through the desk

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:55.370
and keeping a watch.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.305
One of them walked this
way out of your peripheral

00:34:57.305 --> 00:34:58.683
and out of sight, and
that's all you've seen.

00:34:58.683 --> 00:35:00.100
TALIESIN: So we
went to the right?

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.808
MATT: You guys went
around this side now.

00:35:01.808 --> 00:35:02.933
You're over in this pocket.

00:35:02.933 --> 00:35:04.043
LAURA: Okay, so we could
go around that wall--

00:35:04.043 --> 00:35:06.210
SAM: We could go around.
Or we can come in this far.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.294
MATT: This is the extension
of the main cathedral.

00:35:08.294 --> 00:35:10.596
So this is the initial chamber.

00:35:10.596 --> 00:35:12.237
And then you could go
around or though here,

00:35:12.237 --> 00:35:13.452
and this would lead
into the main cathedral.

00:35:13.452 --> 00:35:14.882
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:14.882 --> 00:35:16.590
LAURA: Yeah, we'll keep going back?

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.090
LIAM: Further in.
LAURA: Further in.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.390
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Further back.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:23.075
MATT: Okay, so you come
a little further here.

00:35:23.075 --> 00:35:23.875
And where do you
want to draw it?

00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:25.412
SAM: How do you
want to paint this?

00:35:25.412 --> 00:35:26.480
MARISHA: How do you draw this?
(laughter)

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.240
LAURA: I'll do it at
that wall right there.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.040
MATT: Right here?

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.400
LAURA: Yeah, in the corner.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.790
MATT: Okay, so you
take out your paints.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.550
There's still water dripping
off of the roof here.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.020
LAURA: Cover me so I can’t--

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:40.820
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.739
LAURA: So it keeps me dry.
I need to keep my paints dry.

00:35:42.739 --> 00:35:45.240
TRAVIS: And I'll take my cape
and just hold it over.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.040
MATT: Okay.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.330
And so what
crawl space do you paint?

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.180
LAURA: I'm going to paint
a crawl space small,

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.451
just big enough for all of
us to be able to fit through.

00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:56.118
You can get pretty low
to the ground, Caduceus?

00:35:56.118 --> 00:35:57.660
TALIESIN: Likely,
I'll have to crawl.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.620
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.187
SAM: Looks like a good place
for a traveler’s gate to be.

00:36:01.187 --> 00:36:03.880
LAURA: Aww, I like it.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.630
Yeah, I'll write Traveler's
Gate along the top.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.170
And then it's going
to be like a little--

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.250
MATT: Okay.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.220
You go ahead and finish
your detailed art

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.010
and create a little
open crawl space.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.356
As you finish the
details on it, you watch.

00:36:19.356 --> 00:36:20.366
And it's wild, because
you look at it,

00:36:20.366 --> 00:36:22.295
and it's almost like your
eyes are blurred from it,

00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:23.253
or you're not focusing.

00:36:23.253 --> 00:36:24.753
And then once your
eyes focus again,

00:36:24.753 --> 00:36:26.586
it's like there was
always an opening there.

00:36:26.586 --> 00:36:28.452
SAM: Wow!

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:30.960
MATT: It's wild, and as you
make your way in,

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.210
it is indeed a crawl
space that you could

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.851
all fit through one by one.

00:36:34.851 --> 00:36:36.060
So what's the marching order?

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.860
LAURA: Oh god.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.455
SAM: Go in and
scout around first?

00:36:38.455 --> 00:36:39.970
TRAVIS: Sneaky as fuck right?

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.550
SAM: All right,
I'll turn invisible.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:42.700
MARISHA: Check for traps.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.530
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.730
LAURA: What would be this--

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.498
SAM: Well, there's no trap here.

00:36:46.498 --> 00:36:49.818
LAURA: Two feet by three feet?

00:36:49.818 --> 00:36:51.557
LAURA: No, that's probably
high, like two by two?

00:36:52.357 --> 00:36:53.920
MATT: Two by two is
what you would do, yeah.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.727
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

00:36:54.727 --> 00:36:56.820
TALIESIN: I'm going to
have to elbow it, but yeah.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.153
LIAM: And spikes that come down.

00:36:58.153 --> 00:37:00.238
MATT: Right, if or when you
guys want to go through,

00:37:00.238 --> 00:37:02.091
what is the marching order?
Who's going in first?

00:37:02.091 --> 00:37:04.170
SAM: I'm going in first.
MATT: Nott's going first.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.170
Who would be after Nott?

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.343
TRAVIS: Rolling in second.

00:37:06.343 --> 00:37:08.025
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: I'll go after Fjord.

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:10.537
LAURA: I'll go behind Beau.
TALIESIN: I'll go behind Laura.

00:37:10.537 --> 00:37:11.954
TRAVIS: Laura?
LAURA: Who's Laura?

00:37:11.954 --> 00:37:13.410
TALIESIN: Well, Jester, fine.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.018
(laughter)

00:37:15.018 --> 00:37:16.000
MATT: Okay.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.958
LIAM: (singing) Caleb takes the rear.

00:37:17.958 --> 00:37:20.000
MATT: And then Pumat will
come in after you guys.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.830
LAURA: Yay, Pumat!

00:37:22.007 --> 00:37:24.590
Will Pumat fit?

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:27.310
MATT: Yeah, if Caduceus can fit.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:30.330
He might have a momentary
Winnie the Pooh moment,

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.226
but he'll eventually
make his way through.

00:37:32.226 --> 00:37:33.952
LAURA: (singing) Pumat,
we need the Pumat.

00:37:33.952 --> 00:37:35.910
MATT: As you're painting
this and finishing up,

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.660
Pumat's like, "Well,
I'm not going to lie,

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.210
“that's really impressive.

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.495
“By the way, how did you
stop that worm thing?"

00:37:41.495 --> 00:37:42.810
SAM: Oh!

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.560
TALIESIN: That's a
conversation for later.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.850
SAM: We have a
counterfeit badge.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.362
LAURA: Yeah, it's
like a secret--

00:37:49.362 --> 00:37:50.820
MATT: "Okay.
Well, we'll talk later."

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.620
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.162
MATT: "That's just
really impressive.

00:37:53.162 --> 00:37:54.470
“Confusing, but impressive."

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:55.595
TRAVIS: Explain later.

00:37:55.595 --> 00:37:57.240
MATT: All right, so
you head in first.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.749
You're waiting for Nott's go?

00:37:58.749 --> 00:38:00.416
Or are you going
immediately after Nott?

00:38:00.416 --> 00:38:01.930
TRAVIS: I'm going after Nott.
MATT: Okay.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:02.730
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.530
Stealth check for both you.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:04.340
LAURA: Are you waiting, or
are you going right after?

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.343
TRAVIS: Oh, no, no, no, yeah.

00:38:05.343 --> 00:38:07.404
No, I'm just like
putting my head down.

00:38:07.404 --> 00:38:08.821
I think we're all
cramming

00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:10.005
into the doorway, yeah.

00:38:10.005 --> 00:38:12.000
MATT: Stealth check
with advantage, please.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.595
TRAVIS: I will also
summon the sword.

00:38:14.595 --> 00:38:15.497
MATT: Okay.

00:38:15.497 --> 00:38:17.206
TRAVIS: And I will
cast See Invisibility.

00:38:17.206 --> 00:38:18.750
(oohing)
MATT: Okay.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.417
TRAVIS: So I can track
Nott in the room.

00:38:20.417 --> 00:38:21.970
LAURA: (oohing)
MATT: You got it.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:23.175
SAM: I'm just doing this.

00:38:23.175 --> 00:38:24.570
(laughter)

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:25.395
Whoo!

00:38:25.395 --> 00:38:26.520
TRAVIS: She's hurt herself.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.320
Oh no!

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.610
She's dead, we should leave.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.005
(laughter)

00:38:31.005 --> 00:38:35.360
SAM: All right, I'll
roll for stealth.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.420
Plus two-- 27.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.770
MATT: 27?

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:39.660
Okay.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.310
As you carefully step
in, you enter what

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:52.555
is a beautiful religious space.

00:38:52.555 --> 00:38:54.930
It's similar to when you first
entered the Bright Queen's

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:58.753
corridor, just that
overwhelming beauty,

00:38:58.753 --> 00:38:59.670
though very different.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.980
Whereas that was a
very cold white light,

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.210
this cavernous church
chamber is a glorious hall

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:09.810
of towering stone walls
draped in red velvet banners,

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.210
chiseled detailed framing
around the numerous 40-foot

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.270
tall stained glass windows.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:18.390
You see murals of holy stories
depicted across them with Pelor

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:22.170
iconography brought to warm life
by colorful beams of sunlight

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.750
that are coming from that
one particular shaft that

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.520
makes its way into the cathedral.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.510
It engulfs the interior
in this warmth,

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.580
this hearth-type feel, which

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:38.773
is very conflicting with the
people that hold the inside.

00:39:38.773 --> 00:39:40.190
You do notice in
the center, there

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.970
is a raised central
platform that

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.860
holds an altar to the
Dawnfather, as well as

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.800
candelabra arranged around it.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.860
You can see a series of
pews that are aligned back.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.570
You can see there
are two large towers

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.360
that rise up in the middle
of the chamber, with balconies.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.370
And there are a set of
raised royal seats

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.890
towards the back that face
the entire inside, with stairs

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.180
that raise up to them.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.900
You can see about eight figures
similarly cloaked to the ones

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:11.160
that you saw in there,
as well as an older woman

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.152
in red, gold, and silver,
Cardinal Respa--

00:40:13.152 --> 00:40:14.236
SAM: (whispering) Oh shit!

00:40:14.236 --> 00:40:16.640
MATT: --currently
at the altar, and is

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.208
in the process of
reciting something

00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:19.250
in a low, muttered voice.

00:40:22.922 --> 00:40:25.960
SAM: Do I know that you
cast See Invisibility?

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.852
So I'm just going to say, like--

00:40:28.852 --> 00:40:32.240
TRAVIS: Nine people.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.940
10 people.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.740
Eight-- no, eight.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.740
(laughs) Eight people.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.350
LIAM: Second
syllable, sounds like?

00:40:40.932 --> 00:40:43.890
TRAVIS: Medusa is inside?

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.650
Yes.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.140
Apparently, there are eight
people inside, and one

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.040
crazy woman with weird hair.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.210
(laughter)

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.215
LAURA: Oh, I bet that's
the lady that I saw.

00:40:55.215 --> 00:40:56.015
TRAVIS: Who did you see?

00:40:56.015 --> 00:40:57.435
LAURA: She had really
fucked up hair.

00:40:57.435 --> 00:40:58.476
TRAVIS: What does she do?

00:40:58.476 --> 00:40:59.276
What do we know about her?

00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:00.640
LAURA: She looked
like the old lady that

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.765
ran the place or something.

00:41:01.765 --> 00:41:03.182
MARISHA: How do
we mean fucked up?

00:41:03.182 --> 00:41:04.480
Like bad breakage and damage?

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.280
(laughter)

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.292
LAURA: Yeah, it
was really frizzy.

00:41:06.292 --> 00:41:07.923
I feel like Nott would
notice, you know?

00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:08.723
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

00:41:08.723 --> 00:41:09.640
LIAM: What's the plan?

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.135
We're interrupting this?

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.810
LAURA: I mean, I don't know.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:13.610
Probably?

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.346
I don't know.

00:41:15.346 --> 00:41:18.720
MARISHA: Does Nott see Yasha?

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.576
Does Nott see Yasha?

00:41:19.576 --> 00:41:20.670
MATT: Yasha is not in this room.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.872
TALIESIN: No, I would say,
because I've got a bead on--

00:41:22.872 --> 00:41:24.330
LAURA: Can you feel
where Yasha is?

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.130
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.210
LAURA: Where is she?
TALIESIN: Underground?

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.830
MATT: As you continue
to look around,

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:30.872
you can see towards the
very back of the chamber,

00:41:30.872 --> 00:41:32.910
behind the altar, there is

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:37.830
a stone entryway, with
a metal door that is closed.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:41.040
And it seems to slope
downward, indicating

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.440
a passageway that leads
deeper beneath the cathedral.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.440
SAM: And she's doing
a ritual right now?

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.415
TRAVIS: On this map, is that
altar back towards you, or--

00:41:49.415 --> 00:41:50.540
MATT: Why don't I show you?

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.949
(cheering)

00:41:53.949 --> 00:41:55.760
MARISHA: Blasting through maps!

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.300
TALIESIN: Map blasts!

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.191
TRAVIS: Here's the thing, now
we only have one point of entry

00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:01.993
to get all eight of us in in
a hurried fashion, versus two.

00:42:01.993 --> 00:42:03.410
MARISHA: And then
across the room?

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.250
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.740
SAM: This other
map is also brought

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.740
to you by Dwarven Forge.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.270
TRAVIS: So we only have
one point of entry.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.070
SAM: Go say hi--

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.582
TRAVIS: We'd have all eight
in real fast and fan--

00:42:10.582 --> 00:42:11.429
SAM: --at PAX Unplugged--

00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:13.474
TRAVIS: --versus two and flank.
(laughter)

00:42:13.474 --> 00:42:15.050
SAM: --the first
weekend of December.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.759
LIAM: But she's
mid-whatever she's doing?

00:42:16.759 --> 00:42:17.920
SAM: @dwarvenforge.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.720
TRAVIS: Oh what?

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.860
SAM: What!

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.209
LAURA: What the shit?

00:42:22.209 --> 00:42:23.425
LIAM: Stunning!

00:42:23.425 --> 00:42:24.270
Stunning!

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:25.070
SAM: You know what?

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.904
We skip this room, too.

00:42:26.904 --> 00:42:29.404
TRAVIS: (yelling) Oh, light it up!

00:42:29.404 --> 00:42:30.514
Pretty!

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:32.402
(cheering)

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.090
TRAVIS: Matt, what
the fuck, man?

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.500
MATT: I've been feeling crafty.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.110
So to give you a little bit
of a heads up at the location

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.175
that you know, Nott.

00:42:40.175 --> 00:42:41.130
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:43.504
SAM: I know not.

00:42:43.504 --> 00:42:45.740
TRAVIS: (maniacal laughter)

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.700
SAM: Whoa!
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.240
LAURA: These guys
are really powerful.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.297
TRAVIS: There's the way down. Oh fuck, fuck.

00:42:52.297 --> 00:42:54.390
MARISHA: Where? 
Where's the way down?

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.480
TRAVIS: Behind the altar
is that stair down.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.330
MARISHA: Oh fuck!

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.420
Oh, there's no way.

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.075
TRAVIS: I'm sure they're all
just like base level fighters.

00:43:05.075 --> 00:43:07.257
LAURA: Maybe we can set a
distraction of something.

00:43:07.257 --> 00:43:08.570
TRAVIS: They're probably
just really, really--

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:09.820
MARISHA: What's with this guy?

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.570
He's got like a sickle.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:12.985
TRAVIS: You know,
these balconies

00:43:12.985 --> 00:43:14.383
probably have more
fuckers in them too,

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.183
I'm just going to say.

00:43:15.183 --> 00:43:16.148
LAURA: Can we send
a distraction in?

00:43:16.148 --> 00:43:18.255
MARISHA: Maybe
we can get up in the balcony

00:43:18.255 --> 00:43:19.213
and send a distraction.

00:43:19.213 --> 00:43:21.030
SAM: I'm in there already.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.470
I can distract.

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.540
MATT: So Nott--

00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:28.120
LAURA: Are there doors
leading to the balconies?

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.115
MARISHA: What do we do?

00:43:29.115 --> 00:43:31.615
TRAVIS: Yes, there are little
doors underneath the balconies

00:43:31.615 --> 00:43:34.673
that might be a winding thing,
or at least there is on the one

00:43:34.673 --> 00:43:35.590
that's closest to you.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.818
MATT: So Nott, you've
come in through--

00:43:36.818 --> 00:43:38.360
you guys have been
on this side here.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.390
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:42.130
MATT: So you've come through,
and you're in this far corner

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:42.930
right there.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:45.002
LAURA: Whoa, I'm so
close to a person, ah!

00:43:45.002 --> 00:43:47.000
MATT: There's an individual
right to the left,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.550
and you see them
looking,

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.110
occasionally checking in.

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.450
Every now and then, you'll
hear the rattling of keys.

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.340
And one of the doors
over there, which opens

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.940
up into the previous chamber--

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.860
somebody pokes through
and asks, "Nothing yet?

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.670
“Best we hurry," and locks
it again behind him.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:07.070
SAM: And can I just watch
the ritual for a second,

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.270
and just see like--

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:11.090
does it seem like it's
crescendoing or anything,

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:13.700
or is it just an even chant?

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.660
MATT: You listen to it, and
the phrases are less of a--

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.040
you don't sense any magic.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.235
It seems like it's a sermon.

00:44:20.235 --> 00:44:21.035
SAM: Sermon?

00:44:21.035 --> 00:44:22.395
Okay.

00:44:22.395 --> 00:44:26.690
MATT: Speaking of-- you hear
the old woman go, "And it was

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:33.000
“upon this day that the Angel
rose up and gifted upon us

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.540
“our boons for what we've
given, for what we have

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.230
“sacrificed by the family below.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.100
“They will break the
first of many chains.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:47.210
“And soon, the Angel will give
unto us what we have earned."

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.460
And they're all
listening intently, while also

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.440
keeping an eye out on the room.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.422
SAM: Shit.

00:44:52.422 --> 00:44:54.530
LAURA: (whispering)
Murder through the throat,

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.103
just like we did
that guard up top.

00:44:56.103 --> 00:44:58.640
LIAM: They're talking about
breaking the chains of the Chained Oblivion.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.570
Cut it off now.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.210
MARISHA: Should we try and
stealth in and surround

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.710
and ambush, and get the jump?

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.370
LAURA: How?
MARISHA: I don't know!

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.329
TRAVIS: It doesn't look
like there's any cover.

00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:09.020
SAM: I'm going to
slowly just walk

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.780
that way in the room, away
from the entrance point,

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.480
as slow and stealthy
as possible.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.970
MATT: Okay, you're still on the
stealth check that you rolled.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.345
TRAVIS: If she
can draw attention

00:45:17.345 --> 00:45:18.429
to other side of the room?

00:45:18.429 --> 00:45:19.229
MATT: You are invisible.

00:45:19.229 --> 00:45:21.860
As you get across to that pillar
over there, you do stop

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.277
and look back, and
you see there's

00:45:23.277 --> 00:45:25.611
a slight trail of water from
the rain that you've taken.

00:45:25.611 --> 00:45:26.700
SAM: Oh shit!

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.950
MATT: Nobody seems to notice.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.258
LIAM: You say you
want a distraction

00:45:30.258 --> 00:45:31.300
the far side of the room?

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.690
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.186
LIAM: I can take care of that.

00:45:34.186 --> 00:45:35.720
TRAVIS: All right.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.190
LIAM: Give me 30 seconds.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.118
And I start walking
fast along the side

00:45:41.118 --> 00:45:42.410
of the temple towards the back.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.895
MATT: Back this side, you mean?

00:45:43.895 --> 00:45:44.700
LIAM: Yeah.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.140
MATT: Okay.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.810
SAM: He's alone.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:48.810
LAURA: Where's he going?

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.940
MATT: So you come
around this end.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.940
LAURA: Where's he going?

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.982
MATT: You're now on the
outside of the cathedral.

00:45:52.982 --> 00:45:55.700
LIAM: 20 seconds later,
30 seconds later,

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.090
40 seconds later, a
massive Cat's Claw

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.912
slams through the center
stained glass window.

00:46:01.912 --> 00:46:03.620
MATT: Right here?
LIAM: Yes.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.420
MATT: All righty.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.570
TRAVIS: Oh, ho, ho, ho!

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:06.995
Okay!

00:46:06.995 --> 00:46:10.490
MATT: (crashing)
Breaking into the space here,

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.110
it now sits--

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.230
we'll say right
up and over here.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.883
LAURA: That's
one way to do it.

00:46:15.883 --> 00:46:17.910
SAM: I guess we're going.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, we
rolling in the deep.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:20.826
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:46:20.826 --> 00:46:22.610
MATT: All right,
so the Cat's Claw--

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.735
TRAVIS: Talk to me, Adele!
MATT: --crashes through.

00:46:24.735 --> 00:46:27.680
(crashing) Bits of glass
come raining down from above,

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.230
as the entire thing
falls in on itself.

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:32.600
The sunlight comes
through and shines

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.208
bright onto the center pillar.

00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:35.750
All of them spin
and turn to look up,

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.336
and see the mystical claw.

00:46:38.336 --> 00:46:39.170
What do you guys do?

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.580
TRAVIS: As soon as I hear
the smash, I'll push through.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.497
MARISHA: And I follow.

00:46:42.497 --> 00:46:44.372
MATT: Well, now it's
time to take initiative,

00:46:44.372 --> 00:46:45.872
because you've now
initiated combat.

00:46:45.872 --> 00:46:47.790
LIAM: What do you mean?

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.790
SAM: Yeah, we don't know if
that's a friend or a foe.

00:46:51.585 --> 00:46:52.585
MATT: Okay.

00:46:52.585 --> 00:46:54.078
TALIESIN: Just one normal roll.

00:46:54.078 --> 00:46:56.180
TRAVIS: I meant to roll this
for initiative.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.120
I used to have it.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.610
MARISHA: Ooh, that's garbage!

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:00.152
TALIESIN: That's garbage.

00:47:00.152 --> 00:47:01.520
TRAVIS: Good, good, good, good.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.440
Any natural ones?

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.122
TALIESIN: Well, there's
a natural one on my end.

00:47:04.122 --> 00:47:05.580
TRAVIS: Yay, natural
one, Taliesin!

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.016
LAURA: Yay!
TRAVIS: OSD thanks you, man.

00:47:07.016 --> 00:47:09.190
MARISHA: Oh, that's terrible.
SAM: Hey, that's great!

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.990
TALIESIN: Yay.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.790
MATT: All right.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.046
MARISHA: Man, fuck.
SAM: $500!

00:47:12.046 --> 00:47:12.940
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.740
SAM: Wow!

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.700
TRAVIS: Thank you,
Travis Frederick.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.580
ALL: Thank you,
Travis Frederick.

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.380
LAURA: So cool!

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.679
TALIESIN: For softening the
blow of my pain, you guys.

00:47:18.679 --> 00:47:20.137
TRAVIS: He's a good guy.
Good dude.

00:47:20.137 --> 00:47:22.300
LAURA: Hey, that softens
the blow of the snake eyes

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.384
that you got last session.

00:47:23.384 --> 00:47:26.405
TALIESIN: Oh, it does a little 
bit, it's true.

00:47:26.405 --> 00:47:28.266
MATT: So 25 to 20.

00:47:28.266 --> 00:47:29.220
LAURA: 24.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.394
SAM: 23.

00:47:31.394 --> 00:47:33.735
LIAM: He said 25 to 20.

00:47:33.735 --> 00:47:35.440
MATT: So Jester, you got 24?

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.240
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:40.182 --> 00:47:41.560
MATT: And then you had--
SAM: 23.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.360
MATT: 23.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.300
20 to 15?

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.100
LIAM: 17.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.041
MATT: 17.

00:47:48.041 --> 00:47:50.851
MARISHA: Right on.

00:47:50.851 --> 00:47:51.967
TRAVIS: Wow, the rest of us

00:47:51.967 --> 00:47:53.681
are fucked.
MARISHA: Well, I'm fucking--

00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:54.639
TRAVIS: Ah, ah, ah, ah!

00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:56.556
MARISHA: It's supposed
to be what I'm good at.

00:47:59.946 --> 00:48:01.380
MATT: 15 to 10?

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.180
MARISHA: 12.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:02.980
TRAVIS: 10.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.730
Yeah, yeah, Just breathe it in.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.050
Breathe it in, Caduce.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:13.950
MATT: Caduceus?

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:14.750
TALIESIN: Two.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.360
MATT: All righty.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:30.110
As soon as the glass shatters,
everyone turns and looks.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:33.200
You watch as
Cardinal Respa turns

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.230
and sees it, and moves
her fingers like this,

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:37.310
and then shouts.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:40.100
And the magic that
she summons causes

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.470
her voice to boom loudly.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:45.265
You recognize this as
a Thaumaturgy cantrip.

00:48:45.265 --> 00:48:50.620
She says, "You who intrude on
sacred ground and ceremonies

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.790
“shall be struck down!

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:57.290
“Bathed in his blinding light,
the Angel rises unseen.

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:59.980
“Let their children come!"

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.600
And then she stomps the
ground, and the ground

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.485
just suddenly quakes.

00:49:03.485 --> 00:49:04.285
LAURA: Fuck.

00:49:04.285 --> 00:49:05.180
MATT: All right.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.760
Top of the round, Jester?

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.210
LAURA: Should not
have done that!

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:09.585
MATT: What are
you doing, Jester?

00:49:09.585 --> 00:49:12.740
LAURA: I'm going to
Invoke Duplicity.

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.770
MATT: You are all currently
outside over here.

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:17.120
LAURA: Yeah.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:22.785
And I'm assuming they're
all looking at the window,

00:49:22.785 --> 00:49:23.585
right?

00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:25.425
MATT: They're all looking at
the window at the moment, yeah.

00:49:25.425 --> 00:49:29.240
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going
to send my duplicate in.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.340
SAM: (like Jester) My duplicate.

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.405
LAURA: And she's soundless.

00:49:34.405 --> 00:49:36.090
So this person is distracted.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:40.191
I'm going to have her
come along the wall

00:49:40.191 --> 00:49:41.960
and come back here,
like behind the person.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.256
MATT: Create her
behind the person.

00:49:45.256 --> 00:49:45.996
Okay.

00:49:45.996 --> 00:49:48.795
LAURA: Yeah, and
then I'm going to--

00:49:48.795 --> 00:49:50.115
MATT: So that’s your action.

00:49:50.115 --> 00:49:52.840
LAURA: Yeah.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.430
I'm going to try to sneak in.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:57.648
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

00:49:57.648 --> 00:50:01.000
LAURA: Jesus Christ, guide me!

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.820
Oh no, I can't do that, can I?

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.620
That's an action.

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.704
I'm not going to guide me.

00:50:06.986 --> 00:50:07.786
14.

00:50:07.786 --> 00:50:08.586
MATT: Okay.

00:50:08.586 --> 00:50:10.480
You only move half speed,
because you're going quietly.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.280
LAURA: Okay.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.830
MATT: That puts
you in, one, two--

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:16.580
LAURA: I'm just going
to crouch down right

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.900
next to where we came in at.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.820
I'm going to be
next to that bench.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.980
MATT: Okay.

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.322
You come in and lean
against the bench.

00:50:24.322 --> 00:50:29.015
LAURA: Can my duplicate
have gone further?

00:50:29.015 --> 00:50:30.680
MATT: Sure, let that happen.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.530
LAURA: Okay.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.780
MATT: Okay.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:36.110
So that comes into the
visual perspective now.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.630
The person who's right
here is looking up,

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.393
and in the peripheral, they
see the duplicate moving.

00:50:41.393 --> 00:50:42.450
LAURA: Like running
over this way?

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.825
MATT: Yeah, so
they turn and go--

00:50:43.825 --> 00:50:45.450
LAURA: They're looking
from right here.

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:46.785
MATT: --and shout, "Intruder!"

00:50:46.785 --> 00:50:48.432
Some of them look back.

00:50:48.432 --> 00:50:50.331
LAURA: I want it to seem like
she came through the door.

00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:52.720
MATT: Right, they all
look and they see that,

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.330
and a few of them look to you.

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:56.760
LAURA: Goddamn it.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.590
MATT: So that's your move,
and that's your action.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.440
Bonus action, or are you good?

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.281
LAURA: That's it.

00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:02.990
MATT: All right, that
finishes your turn.

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:04.010
Next is Nott.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:05.990
Nott, you are over here behind.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:10.200
You see Jester sneak in and
create the illusory duplicate

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.000
of herself.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.100
Come in, and then you
notice that people

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.290
seem to have spotted the
illusion, and possibly, her.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.090
What do you do?

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.715
LAURA: Well, hold
on, I can do a bonus.

00:51:17.715 --> 00:51:19.925
I can do a spell
for my bonus action.

00:51:19.925 --> 00:51:21.120
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.565
LAURA: But I just feel like
it's going to make a noise.

00:51:23.565 --> 00:51:24.655
SAM: They already see you.

00:51:24.655 --> 00:51:26.292
LAURA: They already see
me, that's the thing.

00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:27.250
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.150
LAURA: Okay, then I'm
going to cast Spiritual

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.170
Weapon at 2nd-level.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:35.252
MATT: Where are you
going to drop it?

00:51:35.252 --> 00:51:38.400
LAURA: Right over the
head of that person.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.200
MATT: Right here?

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.000
LAURA: Yeah.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.165
MATT: Okay.

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:43.790
LAURA: I'm just going
to bring it down.

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:45.374
MATT: Go ahead and
roll for an attack.

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:53.742
LAURA: 27.

00:51:53.742 --> 00:51:54.900
MATT: That hits.

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:55.942
Go ahead and roll damage.

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.050
LAURA: It's not an eight.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.410
Oh, Jesus.

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.700
Eight points of damage.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.990
MATT: Eight points of damage.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.790
Whack!

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.581
Hit over the head, and
looks back towards where it

00:52:09.581 --> 00:52:10.790
came from, and sees a large--

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:12.810
LAURA: It looks like
my duplicate cast it.

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:13.860
Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:14.860
LAURA: Just so you know.

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.980
MATT: Okay.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.855
LAURA: All my spells
come from the duplicate.

00:52:17.855 --> 00:52:20.570
MATT: Right, understood.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.250
So after getting
whacked in the head

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:24.920
by the lollipop
mystically floating in the air,

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.960
they're noticing the
duplicate, looks at it,

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.335
sees somebody
shouting intruder,

00:52:28.335 --> 00:52:30.544
and looks around
and is just really confused.

00:52:30.544 --> 00:52:33.050
That person doesn't quite
notice you at the moment.

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:34.810
But others up here seem to.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:36.770
All right, Nott,
what are you doing?

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:40.490
SAM: Full movement, a sort of
back diagonal towards the claw,

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:44.010
basically, as far as I can get.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:45.030
MATT: 35, right there.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.830
SAM: Oh.

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:50.052
Well, then as I'm
moving, I will--

00:52:50.652 --> 00:52:52.705
shit, should I reveal myself?

00:52:52.705 --> 00:52:55.489
LAURA: Maybe you can shoot,
and then hide behind a thing.

00:52:55.489 --> 00:52:56.768
SAM: Well, that's what
I was going to do,

00:52:56.768 --> 00:52:58.340
but they'll still see me.

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:02.840
All right, as I'm moving, I
will shoot at Cardinal Respa.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.725
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: Come on!

00:53:03.725 --> 00:53:05.350
MATT: You have not
been noticed by her,

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.184
so you have an advantage
in the attack roll.

00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:08.664
SAM: Yes, great!

00:53:08.664 --> 00:53:09.540
LAURA: Ooh!

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.460
SAM: 29 to hit.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.783
MATT: That definitely hits.

00:53:12.783 --> 00:53:15.440
SAM: Yes!

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.640
All right, let's
see what we get.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.808
Not the greatest.

00:53:22.808 --> 00:53:24.410
TRAVIS: Nott the greatest.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.755
SAM: 24 points of damage.

00:53:27.755 --> 00:53:29.490
MATT: Ooh!

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.795
SAM: What if we
fight more people?

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:41.910
I'll just leave it at
that, and then I will--

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.253
so you say I can get to
there, but I can't bonus

00:53:44.253 --> 00:53:45.120
action hide, right?

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.821
MATT: No, because you have--
SAM: I'm not behind anything.

00:53:46.821 --> 00:53:49.060
MATT: And you've revealed
yourself now with the attack.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:49.860
SAM: Yes.

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.890
MATT: And as you fire, you
watch as Cardinal Respa, who

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.930
currently saw the
smashing glass,

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:58.215
heard intruder,
turned and saw Jester.

00:53:58.215 --> 00:53:59.590
You were noticed
by the cardinal.

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:01.500
And you can see as
she begins to cast--

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.584
or beginning the process
of thinking about a spell

00:54:03.584 --> 00:54:06.219
to release before
(groaning) in the side,

00:54:06.219 --> 00:54:08.428
and she reaches back, the
two other guys behind her--

00:54:08.428 --> 00:54:10.428
there are three that are
watching her-- suddenly

00:54:10.428 --> 00:54:12.011
go, and look in your
direction, seeing

00:54:12.011 --> 00:54:13.428
the source of where
it comes from,

00:54:13.428 --> 00:54:14.437
and they immediately
see you appear.

00:54:14.437 --> 00:54:16.020
And there's nowhere
to hide from them.

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.830
SAM: Well, then I will
use my bonus action

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:21.910
to dash the full
movement back behind,

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:23.920
and just keep going
around the circle.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.690
MATT: 30-35, that's as far
as you can you get there.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:27.490
Okay?

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:29.171
Unless you want to be
up against the wall.

00:54:29.171 --> 00:54:30.671
SAM: I'll be against
the wall, yeah.

00:54:30.671 --> 00:54:33.580
MATT: All right, there you go.

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.690
All right, that
finishes Nott's go.

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:36.610
Caleb, you're up.

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.585
LIAM: I need to understand
what I see from outside.

00:54:38.585 --> 00:54:41.750
Is that window ground
level or high above me?

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:42.798
MATT: This?
LIAM: Yeah.

00:54:42.798 --> 00:54:44.800
MATT: When you shattered it,
you shattered it low.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.120
And then the top
part mostly

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.135
broke, though there's
still parts of it

00:54:47.135 --> 00:54:49.121
up there, but there's
like hanging broken bits,

00:54:49.121 --> 00:54:50.080
and it's jagged.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.460
You could carefully
get through--

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.825
LIAM: Can walk through is what
I'm asking, or is it up and in?

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:56.940
MATT: You could certainly try.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.690
It looks like there's
anywhere between two

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.740
to three feet of broken,
jagged stained glass there.

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.209
But you could try
kicking it out.

00:55:04.209 --> 00:55:05.668
You could try and
climb through it.

00:55:05.668 --> 00:55:07.160
LIAM: Instead, for
my bonus action,

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:11.860
I will pull the Cat's Claw
down through that jagged glass,

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.890
cracking out as much as
possible near the bottom.

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:20.380
And I'll use the Claw to
push me the distance up

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.210
into the building.

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:25.235
Forceful Hand pushes, and I
will have to save against it.

00:55:25.235 --> 00:55:26.225
MATT: Right, so
you're back here,

00:55:26.225 --> 00:55:27.078
or all the way to the back?

00:55:27.078 --> 00:55:28.758
LIAM: Yeah, I'm right
where I poked through.

00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:29.686
MATT: All right, sorry.

00:55:29.686 --> 00:55:31.980
LIAM: So just to scoop me
up and in, if possible.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:34.013
MATT: I'll allow it.

00:55:34.013 --> 00:55:35.060
That'll be your
action to do that.

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:37.008
LIAM: The Cat's
action or my action?

00:55:37.008 --> 00:55:39.330
Because it's a bonus
action once it's cast.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.190
MATT: Oh, it's a bonus action
to have it attack and move?

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.360
LIAM: Yeah, on subsequent turns.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.710
So I did the spell
before combat started.

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:46.510
MATT: Right, right.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:47.980
LIAM: This is a
new turn, so it's

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.720
a bonus action for it to do
whatever it's going to do,

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.220
according to the spell.
MATT: Right.

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.490
I'm just trying to remember,
is it attack and you

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:57.676
can move it on a bonus action?

00:55:57.676 --> 00:55:58.760
Or is it one or the other?

00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.719
SAM: Going to the book!

00:55:59.719 --> 00:56:01.525
LIAM: I believe it
can move and attack.

00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:02.650
MATT: Just double checking.

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:04.660
LIAM: As a bonus action
on your subsequent turn,

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.160
you can move the
hand up to 60 feet,

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.420
and then cause one of the
following effects with it.

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.460
MATT: Gotcha.
Okay, cool.

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:12.390
Yeah, so it scoops
through, clears

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:14.140
out the bottom of the
glass, picks you up,

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:15.980
and then lifts you.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.483
TALIESIN: It moves fast!
60 feet.

00:56:17.483 --> 00:56:18.400
LIAM: 60 feet, yeah.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.680
MATT: It's pretty quick.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.440
LAURA: Ah!

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.400
SAM: Wow, Matt!

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.775
TRAVIS: Wow!
LAURA: That is cool!

00:56:23.775 --> 00:56:24.895
You've got two of them?

00:56:24.895 --> 00:56:26.198
MATT: Yep, it's a backup.

00:56:26.198 --> 00:56:27.240
And it lifts you through.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.265
SAM: A backup!

00:56:28.265 --> 00:56:30.693
MATT: I would say after
clearing all that out, scooping

00:56:30.693 --> 00:56:32.175
you up and bringing you
in, it has maybe like 10,

00:56:32.175 --> 00:56:32.975
15 more feet.

00:56:32.975 --> 00:56:34.090
LAURA: Riding in on
a giant cats hand.

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:34.890
LIAM: Oh, I'm so--

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:38.980
well, I come scooping up in
here and get the lay of the land

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.450
in like three seconds,
and from the claw,

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:48.640
you see my hands come out and
go (whooshing). And a ball of fire

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.570
from the guano and sulfur
pours out my hands,

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:56.410
and I throw it centered maybe
to that side of the altar

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:59.870
by her right, by
Respa's right side.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:00.670
MATT: All right.

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:04.020
TRAVIS: Fucking light them up!
MARISHA: Sick!

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:06.152
MATT: To whereabouts?

00:57:06.152 --> 00:57:08.110
LIAM: This side of her.
MATT: This side of her?

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:09.450
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: So right there?

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:11.500
LIAM: Yeah, right there.

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.130
MATT: You're trying to
get all of them in it?

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.930
LIAM: Yeah.

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.680
MATT: All right, go
ahead and roll damage.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.410
LIAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:18.396
LIAM: Yeah, so am I.

00:57:18.396 --> 00:57:22.120
MATT: It just detonates in
the center of the explosion,

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.760
resounding through the
flames, causing in the middle

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.876
the air, this pure sphere of
burning fire, the bottom of it

00:57:27.876 --> 00:57:29.710
just being cut off on
the top of the pillar,

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.660
and just engulfs
everything up there.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.350
LIAM: And this is at 4th level.

00:57:35.031 --> 00:57:37.130
TRAVIS: I love how the high
level spells make you out

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:38.963
of breath when you cast them.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:57:38.963 --> 00:57:40.547
MATT: The cardinal's
at 19, so she's--

00:57:40.547 --> 00:57:43.835
MARISHA: There's so
much on the line!

00:57:43.835 --> 00:57:45.130
SAM: She made her save?

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.338
MATT: She did.

00:57:47.338 --> 00:57:49.520
LIAM: 18, 24.

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.950
MATT: What's this?

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:52.300
LIAM: 30 points of fire damage.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.342
SAM: Nice, nice, nice!

00:57:53.342 --> 00:57:54.690
LIAM: No, that's one more.

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:57.140
MATT: 31?

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.700
LIAM: 36 points of fire damage.

00:57:58.700 --> 00:57:59.500
MATT: 36?

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:00.931
Nice.

00:58:00.931 --> 00:58:04.030
All right, so she takes
half damage, she succeeds.

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:08.360
He takes half damage there.

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.900
MATT: And he fails
and takes full.

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:11.555
TRAVIS: 18 is great on that.

00:58:11.555 --> 00:58:12.655
It just looks awesome.

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:13.455
MATT: (whooshing)

00:58:13.455 --> 00:58:14.350
SAM: Oh!

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.540
MATT: And he ignited,
and just screams

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.550
and crumples to the
ground, just a charred

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:20.670
skeleton left in its place.

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:23.040
This one here is cocked.

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:27.600
14? No, that's a fail.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.012
LIAM: Is that a wisdom save now?
MATT: Huh?

00:58:30.012 --> 00:58:31.444
LIAM: These are humanoids
going down from fire.

00:58:31.444 --> 00:58:33.177
MATT: Yes, it would.
SAM: Oh no!

00:58:33.631 --> 00:58:34.580
LAURA: Each one?

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.460
Do you have to do a
save for each one?

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.040
MATT: At the end of the
turn, if it's killed one.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.270
You don't have to
do it for each one.

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:42.320
LIAM: 18.
MATT: 18?

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.500
Okay, you're still holding on.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.990
So here-- fails.

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:47.190
LAURA: Whoo!
MATT: (whooshing)

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.958
SAM: Whoa!
MATT: Incinerated.

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.927
Last one fails.

00:58:51.927 --> 00:58:55.510
(cheering)

00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:56.990
MATT: You watch as all of them scream.

00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:59.006
Only two of them manage
to dodge out of the way,

00:58:59.006 --> 00:59:01.292
tumble down the stairs, put
out the flames on their back,

00:59:01.292 --> 00:59:02.900
before they stand back up
and turn in your direction.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.650
TRAVIS: Open the door,
like, you would not

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:06.314
believe what just happened.
(laughter)

00:59:06.314 --> 00:59:09.830
LIAM: And Caleb's ears are
ringing from the sounds

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:12.470
of the screams, and he
just dives, and falls down

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.590
behind that slope of
stone, with his movement

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:15.995
off of the Cat's Claw.

00:59:15.995 --> 00:59:18.670
TRAVIS: Hit and slide.

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:21.070
MATT: Make an acrobatics
check, please.

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:23.527
LIAM: I'm so good at that.

00:59:23.527 --> 00:59:24.860
Acrobatics, you said?
MATT: Yes.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:25.585
LIAM: Seven!

00:59:25.585 --> 00:59:28.332
MATT: All right, you are
prone behind it, right there.

00:59:28.332 --> 00:59:29.654
LAURA: On top of
a bunch of glass?

00:59:29.654 --> 00:59:31.095
TRAVIS: Not bad.
MATT: Yep!

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.360
LIAM: Hit me.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.961
MATT: So you take two
points of piercing damage.

00:59:36.961 --> 00:59:37.920
As you tumble--

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.050
TALIESIN: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow--
MATT: --lying on your side.

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:41.969
It's all jammed into
your cloak and stuff.

00:59:41.969 --> 00:59:43.761
LAURA: Both me and my
duplicate, we're were-- like ah!

00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:44.636
Ooh!
MATT: Ooh, yeah.

00:59:44.636 --> 00:59:45.436
(laughter)

00:59:45.436 --> 00:59:46.991
LIAM: It's just like "Die Hard!"

00:59:46.991 --> 00:59:49.146
(laughter)

00:59:49.146 --> 00:59:51.950
TALIESIN: Now I've got a
fire spell, ho, ho, ho.

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.577
LIAM: Yippee yi-oh
ki-ay, motherfucker!

00:59:54.577 --> 00:59:57.890
MATT: That's a reminder
of your concentration.

00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.142
All right, that brings us
to this one right here.

01:00:00.142 --> 01:00:01.851
And Jester is also
holding concentration,

01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:04.056
because of her duplicate.

01:00:04.056 --> 01:00:06.353
We're going to
start with this one.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:09.060
Got it. That finishes
your turn, Caleb?

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.610
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MATT: All righty.

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.980
It is now the cultists’ turn.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.670
There are these two here.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:21.020
They saw Jester, but then all of
a sudden, flames burst in.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.221
This one's going to
run (counting)--

01:00:23.221 --> 01:00:24.430
MARISHA: Where you going?

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:25.422
MATT: 30.

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:26.631
MARISHA: Where you going?

01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:31.010
MATT: This one's going to rush
over, (counting) 30.

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.860
And he does get close to you.

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.885
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Oh no!

01:00:33.885 --> 01:00:36.260
TALIESIN: Well, does the Claw
get to do anything on that?

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.940
MATT: No, the Claw isn't a
creature, technically.

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:41.210
It's going to make
two melee attacks against you.

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.010
LIAM: Oh good.

01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:43.550
MATT: The first one
is going to be--

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:45.368
That's cocked.

01:00:45.368 --> 01:00:46.760
MATT: Oof!

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.190
24 to hit.
LIAM: Hits.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.990
SAM: Yikes.

01:00:50.915 --> 01:00:55.890
You take six points
of piercing damage.

01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:56.950
And the second attack--

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:59.260
SAM: Is it harder because
he's prone, or easier

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.915
because he's prone to hit him?
MATT: Huh?

01:01:00.915 --> 01:01:03.040
LAURA: On a melee it’s easier.
MATT: On melee it's advantage.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:03.910
SAM: Oh shit.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.202
MATT: The second one would be--

01:01:05.202 --> 01:01:07.323
Yes. Thank you for reminding me.

01:01:07.323 --> 01:01:08.513
SAM: Oh fuck!

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:10.520
MATT: 21
LIAM: Hits.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.690
MATT: Okay.

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:15.290
You then suffer four points
of piercing damage, as it

01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:17.965
stabs you twice with daggers.

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:19.130
SAM: You're fine.
LIAM: So fine.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.930
SAM: Suck it up.

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:24.150
MATT: This one's going to go
ahead and rush up, and

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.480
get on the other side of you.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.098
And now two of them
are ready to

01:01:27.098 --> 01:01:28.390
stab the fuck of you next turn.

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:29.849
Had to use its
action to get there.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.720
Actually, you know what?

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.410
No, he's not.

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:38.752
This guy is a different type.

01:01:38.752 --> 01:01:40.711
He's going to go ahead
and use his bonus action

01:01:40.711 --> 01:01:45.360
LIAM: He’s a Gemini.
MATT: --and summon a Spiritual Weapon.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.220
SAM: Oh!
LIAM: What's it look like?

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.020
MARISHA: Ooh!

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:52.330
MATT: In this you see a large sword of flame--

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.280
MATT: --with dangling
chains of fire off of it.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.080
SAM: Ooh!

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.250
MATT: As it swings in the
air, it arcs down towards you.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.216
TRAVIS: Great attack.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.016
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:02.550
MATT: That is going
to be 18 to hit.

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:03.350
LIAM: Shield.

01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.933
MARISHA: I like your
modifications, man.

01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:06.266
MATT: All right, that misses.

01:02:06.266 --> 01:02:10.230
(whooshing) The shield deflects
the blow from the weapon.

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.710
That's going to finish its turn.

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:15.300
Now the regular cultists.
Another one's over here.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.040
He's going to go ahead and--

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.522
MARISHA: Regular
cultist, regular cultist.

01:02:19.522 --> 01:02:20.748
SAM: Doesn't quite
have the same ring.

01:02:20.748 --> 01:02:22.745
MARISHA: No, that
wasn't the same.

01:02:22.745 --> 01:02:24.036
Too many syllables.

01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:25.003
TRAVIS: Save it.

01:02:25.663 --> 01:02:28.350
MATT: He's going to come up
and be face to face with you.

01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.910
SAM: I'd like to see you try!

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:32.068
MATT: This one--

01:02:32.968 --> 01:02:34.275
MARISHA: There is a
hidden one, right?

01:02:34.275 --> 01:02:35.150
There's a hidden one.

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:36.370
MATT: It's going
to go over and

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:38.738
attempt to strike
the duplicate Jester.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.435
And it does nothing.

01:02:42.435 --> 01:02:43.235
LAURA: Yay!

01:02:43.235 --> 01:02:45.150
MATT: It swings
through, but now is well

01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:47.310
aware that it is an illusion.

01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:48.660
That finishes their turn.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.690
Beau, you're up.

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:51.330
MARISHA: All right.
I am going to--

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:53.109
LAURA: The duplicate is
still acting like it got hit.

01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:55.310
It's like, (groaning).

01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:56.388
MATT: Okay.

01:02:56.858 --> 01:02:58.027
TRAVIS: Doing the Buffy
the Vampire Slayer.

01:02:58.027 --> 01:02:59.380
LIAM: Pee-Wee Herman.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:02.070
(groaning)

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:02.985
LAURA: It's very dramatic.

01:03:02.985 --> 01:03:03.850
MATT: All right.

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:04.650
LIAM: Pause.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:05.722
MATT: Still pretty sure
you're an illusion.

01:03:06.486 --> 01:03:08.945
It literally went to
stab, and its hand went through,

01:03:08.945 --> 01:03:12.781
and then like a second later,
it began to act.

01:03:12.781 --> 01:03:16.100
It's now going--

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.653
Looks back at you and goes--

01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:21.990
Like the GIF of the robot
and the orangutan, like--

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:25.170
All right.

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:27.190
Beau, what are you doing?

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:29.780
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to
slide through this hole

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.680
like I'm sliding
through home base.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.192
MATT: All right, it's good.

01:03:34.192 --> 01:03:36.922
Five, 10, 15.

01:03:36.922 --> 01:03:37.975
You have 15 feet there.

01:03:37.975 --> 01:03:38.850
Where you want to go?

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:40.490
SAM: Church!

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:42.890
MARISHA: 20, 25, 30.

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:43.890
(laughter)

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:47.717
35, 40, 45, 50.

01:03:47.717 --> 01:03:50.050
Can I get base to base with her?
MATT: Your speed is 50?

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:50.850
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:53.433
MATT: Ah, but squeezing through
the hole actually would have--

01:03:53.433 --> 01:03:54.933
to get through the
crawl space would

01:03:54.933 --> 01:03:56.570
have taken 10 feet
of movement, so 50

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:59.121
would get you right there.

01:03:59.121 --> 01:04:02.100
So you don't quite get
base to base with her.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.023
TRAVIS: Almost like
you planned this shit.

01:04:05.023 --> 01:04:05.823
How could you plan for that?

01:04:05.823 --> 01:04:06.691
MARISHA: I never could
have planned for that.

01:04:06.691 --> 01:04:08.107
MATT: Because of the two foot
by two foot crawl space--

01:04:08.107 --> 01:04:08.907
TRAVIS: Oh, totally.

01:04:08.907 --> 01:04:10.279
MATT: --the moment of squeezing
through and getting up

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.255
takes 10 feet of your
movement as opposed to five.

01:04:11.255 --> 01:04:12.558
TRAVIS: Why haven't
you been practicing bear

01:04:12.558 --> 01:04:13.602
crawling in your spare time?

01:04:13.602 --> 01:04:14.552
MARISHA: I know.

01:04:14.552 --> 01:04:16.200
Goddamn it.
TRAVIS: (rapid squelching)

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.529
MARISHA: Even with an armored
movement and shit?

01:04:19.529 --> 01:04:21.510
MATT: Unarmored movement is what
gives you the 50 you can move,

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:23.210
you crazy fucking fast monk.

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:24.124
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:04:24.124 --> 01:04:26.210
LIAM: Can you
lightning punch her?

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:28.029
MATT: I'm sorry
if you're unhappy

01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:29.879
with your super movement
speed and ability to stun

01:04:29.879 --> 01:04:31.162
everything I throw at you.

01:04:31.162 --> 01:04:32.300
(laughter)

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.550
LIAM: Superman kicks a rock.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:35.125
God, this is so lame!

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:36.250
(laughter)

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.250
MARISHA: Yeah, let's lightning.

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:41.232
LAURA: Lightning punch her!

01:04:41.232 --> 01:04:42.542
MATT: Up to you.

01:04:42.542 --> 01:04:43.750
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it.

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:44.847
Let's do it.
It's one minute.

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:45.930
It's one minute.
MATT: Okay.

01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:46.882
MARISHA: Let's start now.

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:49.310
MATT: You rush up, (whooshing)
slam the fists together.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:51.810
The bolts of energy can strike
through, curling up the body.

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:53.295
(whooshing)

01:04:53.295 --> 01:04:54.884
MARISHA: No, but
they're going to see

01:04:54.884 --> 01:04:56.176
my dope hand movements, though.

01:04:56.176 --> 01:04:57.510
(laughter)

01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:58.310
MATT: All righty.

01:04:58.310 --> 01:04:59.520
LIAM: You have to go
cross-eyed, though.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.496
MATT: Now what are you doing?

01:05:02.496 --> 01:05:06.081
MARISHA: I'm going
to rev it up and--

01:05:06.081 --> 01:05:07.862
(impacts)

01:05:09.682 --> 01:05:11.180
SAM: Church!
LIAM: Just rev it up.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.290
MARISHA: (singing)
Take me to church.

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:16.590
I worship like a dog at
the shrine of your lies.

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:18.070
Okay.

01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:18.870
Pop, pop.

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:22.200
19 for the first one,
and 26 for the second.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.364
MATT: Both hit, actually, yeah.

01:05:24.364 --> 01:05:25.164
MARISHA: A-ha!

01:05:25.164 --> 01:05:26.148
TRAVIS: 19 hits.

01:05:26.148 --> 01:05:29.100
MARISHA: 19!

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.576
Okay.

01:05:30.576 --> 01:05:33.660
TRAVIS: Sam, do you remember
what your hit was-- the number?

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.947
SAM: That I hit
the red chick with?

01:05:35.947 --> 01:05:37.280
TRAVIS: The cardinal with?
Yeah.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.170
SAM: I think was a 29 to hit.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:41.635
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 19 hits.

01:05:41.635 --> 01:05:42.435
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:05:42.435 --> 01:05:43.644
TALIESIN: Yeah, good to know.

01:05:43.644 --> 01:05:45.570
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:47.430
10 plus 12--

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:48.963
22 total.
MATT: Nice!

01:05:48.963 --> 01:05:50.130
MARISHA: Lightning damage.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.300
MATT: Both punches, you see the
bolts arcing off about 20 feet,

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.326
hitting the cardinal,
and then striking

01:05:56.326 --> 01:05:58.410
through her chest for
another foot or so before it

01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:00.750
dissipates and curls back,
almost like a slow prominence

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.430
being dragged back by gravity.

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:03.553
With each hit, she (snarls)

01:06:03.553 --> 01:06:05.310
retracts, and looks

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:07.730
at you with these wild
eyes out of anger,

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.305
and then smiles.

01:06:09.305 --> 01:06:12.190
MARISHA: Yeah, you do have
some breakage, honey, yeah.

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:13.510
(laughter)

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:16.140
MATT: So your
bonus action still?

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.930
MARISHA: Oh my god, I do!

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:19.360
MATT: Yeah, you do.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.968
TRAVIS: “Some breakage.”

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:22.910
MARISHA: Patient Defense.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.180
MATT: Okay.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.600
You go into a
defensive position,

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.720
ready to take whatever
onslaught comes your way,

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.070
finishing after Beau's turn.

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:31.233
It is Cardinal Respa's go.

01:06:31.233 --> 01:06:32.925
LAURA: No!

01:06:32.925 --> 01:06:34.360
MATT: She--

01:06:39.075 --> 01:06:40.320
SAM: She's a holy woman.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.860
She wouldn't attack in a church.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.940
LAURA: Yeah, she seems
like a sweet old grandma!

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.930
TALIESIN: Has no one
seen Dead Alive?

01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:48.280
Am I the only one here who knows
how this is going to go?

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.080
Okay, never mind.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.315
TRAVIS: She's just going to
restore all the damage.

01:06:52.315 --> 01:06:54.425
LIAM: She's jetpacking out.

01:06:54.425 --> 01:06:56.556
MATT: She's going to
go ahead and pass.

01:06:56.556 --> 01:06:58.541
LAURA: Oh no.

01:06:58.541 --> 01:06:59.360
Oh no!

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.971
MATT: A good old classic.

01:07:00.971 --> 01:07:02.555
MARISHA: Didn't see
that coming, nope.

01:07:02.555 --> 01:07:04.800
MATT: A good old classic
called Fire Storm.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.600
SAM: Oof!

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.165
(groaning)

01:07:07.165 --> 01:07:09.596
LAURA: She's
high level, y'all.

01:07:09.596 --> 01:07:11.510
MATT: 10 foot cubes.

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:12.340
It's going to--

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:13.140
SAM: Cubes!

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:13.940
(explosions)

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.384
(groaning)

01:07:16.384 --> 01:07:17.280
SAM: What?

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:21.360
MARISHA: I know just how
bad this could be is all.

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:31.300
SAM: Can she hit more than two?

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.700
MATT: She can.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.770
SAM: Which?

01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:34.645
TRAVIS: Is it a line?

01:07:34.645 --> 01:07:35.495
MATT: Nine, 10.

01:07:35.495 --> 01:07:40.030
MARISHA: They just
have to touch bases.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:41.810
LAURA: How many? 10?

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:43.160
MARISHA: 10.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.405
TRAVIS: A fuckload.

01:07:46.405 --> 01:07:49.360
MATT: Yeah, so she'll end up
burning one of her own guys,

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.280
but doesn't give a shit.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.670
TALIESIN: Fucking death cults.

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:55.365
LIAM: Lawful good, man. They’re
the worst.

01:07:55.365 --> 01:07:57.043
LAURA: She'll get two of
her own guys, won't she?

01:07:57.043 --> 01:07:58.820
MATT: No, she can
scoot around this one.

01:07:58.820 --> 01:07:59.620
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.423
MATT: She was around here,
and then curls in that way

01:08:01.423 --> 01:08:03.355
and gets the one next to Nott.
TRAVIS: The big C.

01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:05.938
MATT: So first, that would be--
LAURA: C for Chained Oblivion.

01:08:05.938 --> 01:08:07.730
MATT: --a dexterity
saving throw from Caleb

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:11.440
from Nott and from Beauregard.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.878
Because you are prone--

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.107
SAM: Disadvantage.

01:08:17.107 --> 01:08:18.037
MATT: It doesn't have anything.

01:08:18.037 --> 01:08:19.353
LIAM: Well, I
rolled a natural 20.

01:08:19.353 --> 01:08:20.270
MATT: Oh, good on you.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:21.687
LAURA: (whispering)
Oh, thank god.

01:08:21.687 --> 01:08:23.520
I thought he was going
to say a natural one.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.649
MATT: No, prone doesn’t affect your
dexterity saving throw. Strangely.

01:08:26.649 --> 01:08:28.270
MARISHA: I can take
the dodge action

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.030
as a part of Patient Defense.

01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:31.370
MATT: The dodge action?

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:32.170
MARISHA: Right?

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:33.746
MATT: Well, that's how it works.

01:08:33.746 --> 01:08:35.330
Basically, you've done the dodge
action, which gives attacks against

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:37.258
you have disadvantage.

01:08:37.258 --> 01:08:38.800
MARISHA: Right, I'm an idiot.
No, okay.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.467
MATT: No, that's good.
MARISHA: Okay, yes.

01:08:40.467 --> 01:08:42.384
MATT: So what was your
dexterity saving throw?

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:45.270
MARISHA: It's ... bullshit.

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:47.110
It's 13.

01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:48.370
MATT: 13?
Fail.

01:08:48.370 --> 01:08:49.991
Success.
SAM: 17.

01:08:49.991 --> 01:08:50.851
MATT: Fail.
SAM: Okay.

01:08:50.853 --> 01:08:52.745
LAURA: Oh no!
SAM: Evasion.

01:08:52.745 --> 01:08:54.370
LIAM: I see a lot of
dice in his hands.

01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:56.067
MATT: So you take half damage.
SAM: Yes.

01:08:56.067 --> 01:08:57.825
LAURA: Oh no.

01:08:58.815 --> 01:09:00.974
TALIESIN: I'm going to
be healing, aren't I?

01:09:02.584 --> 01:09:06.080
SAM: You know Jester’s not.

01:09:06.085 --> 01:09:07.180
TALIESIN: Wow!

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.750
MATT: 45 points of fire damage.

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:10.895
So you take 22.

01:09:10.895 --> 01:09:11.852
MATT: You--
MARISHA: Evasion.

01:09:11.852 --> 01:09:13.870
MATT: So 22.
SAM: You have Evasion!?

01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:15.765
You all take 22
points of fire damage.

01:09:15.765 --> 01:09:18.750
As you watch, she raises
her hands up with a smile,

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:19.618
cackling.

01:09:19.618 --> 01:09:20.910
You watch the flames erupt.

01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:24.683
The flames have a strange
darker tint to them,

01:09:24.683 --> 01:09:26.100
as opposed to light
being emitted,

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.569
a shadow is cast from them.

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:31.080
As the fire burns, (explosions)
these pillars of fire burning

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.870
like a giant series of
shock waves of flame

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:35.620
across, curling
around the chamber.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.500
It completely
disintegrates this guy.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.500
Actually, let me roll a saving
throw to see if might survive.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.915
He survives, weirdly!

01:09:41.915 --> 01:09:44.700
(laughter)

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.819
But is really, really,
really, really hurt.

01:09:46.819 --> 01:09:50.365
He's like, “Why?!” back at her.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:56.891
And incinerates the
exterior of each of you.

01:09:56.891 --> 01:09:58.237
The air escapes you for a
minute as it's burned away

01:09:58.237 --> 01:09:59.820
from the flames, and
then it dies down

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.654
and you're all
like, (gasping) little

01:10:01.654 --> 01:10:04.341
bit frazzled, a bit charred.

01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:09.850
Just going to go ahead
and move 25, 30 to there.

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:14.760
MATT: That brings
us to Fjord's turn.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.360
TRAVIS: I will move
through this opening.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.320
MATT: Five, 10, 15 to
get in front of Jester.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.620
TRAVIS: Great.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:27.250
And I'll use the other 15 to
move in more towards the room,

01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:29.530
so I can keep a line of
sight with the cardinal.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:30.920
MATT: Right there, that'll do.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.340
TRAVIS: And I'll
send two Eldritch

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.400
Blasts in her direction.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.077
MATT: Go for it,
roll two strikes.

01:10:37.684 --> 01:10:41.890
TRAVIS: That sucks, 14 and 27.

01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:42.840
MARISHA: Titties.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.136
MATT: 27 hits.

01:10:44.136 --> 01:10:46.450
TRAVIS: Great, great, great.

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:52.770
Seven points of
Eldritch Blast damage.

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:53.950
LAURA: Whoo!

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.881
MATT: Seven points of Eldritch
Blast damage, all right!

01:10:56.881 --> 01:10:58.600
(impact) Gets hit in the chest.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.860
(laughter)

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:01.935
SAM: Who’d you shoot?

01:11:01.935 --> 01:11:03.555
TRAVIS: The cardinal.
SAM: Dame Edna? Okay.

01:11:03.555 --> 01:11:04.355
MATT: All right.

01:11:04.355 --> 01:11:06.156
TRAVIS: Came in, and I
was like, (blasting)

01:11:06.156 --> 01:11:06.956
(laughter)

01:11:06.956 --> 01:11:09.311
MATT: Hey, it
worked a little bit.

01:11:09.311 --> 01:11:10.160
Does that finish your turn?

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:10.960
TRAVIS: It does.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.580
MATT: All right, it
is now Pumat's turn.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.380
(cheering)

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.320
MARISHA: Pumat!

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.980
MATT: And now he's going
to scramble through.

01:11:15.983 --> 01:11:18.401
"Yeah, it's a little
bit of a tight space here.

01:11:18.401 --> 01:11:19.655
It's-- oh no."

01:11:19.655 --> 01:11:22.800
Then he comes in the room
and sees the fire emerging,

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.061
the glass wall crumbled
down, sees Fjord run in

01:11:27.061 --> 01:11:28.186
and fire two Eldritch Blasts.

01:11:28.186 --> 01:11:29.460
One hits the stairs
and scatters,

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.279
the other one hits the
cardinal, who then ducks

01:11:31.279 --> 01:11:32.362
behind the pillar.

01:11:32.362 --> 01:11:34.630
He's like, "Oh, it's--

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:36.062
what have I agreed to do?"

01:11:36.532 --> 01:11:38.324
He's going to go ahead
and move from there.

01:11:38.324 --> 01:11:40.370
He's at that space there.

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:43.120
And then for Pumat's turn,

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:49.440
he's going to cast Dominate Person.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.135
I made notes of which
spells are enchantments.

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:55.735
MATT: Weak.

01:11:55.735 --> 01:11:57.266
TRAVIS: Pumat's evil!

01:11:57.266 --> 01:11:59.226
(laughter)

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.728
MARISHA: He does have a bunch
of servants that look like him.

01:12:07.836 --> 01:12:09.180
MATT: Can I get up here?

01:12:10.003 --> 01:12:11.170
TRAVIS: Sink into the floor.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:15.550
MATT: All right.

01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:20.480
He's actually going to
move 10, 15, 20, 30.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.616
He's going to get right there.

01:12:22.616 --> 01:12:23.440
That'll do.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.020
He's going to cast Dominate
Person on Cardinal Respa.

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.010
SAM: Oh!

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:33.630
MATT: And is going to cast it
on this cultist right there,

01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:35.505
the one that's attacking.

01:12:35.505 --> 01:12:37.250
Because the other one that’s
worrying him off to the side

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.923
is too close for comfort.

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.543
For the hell of it,
someone

01:12:42.543 --> 01:12:43.710
roll a d20 for Cardinal Respa.

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:44.747
TRAVIS: Oh, who's going to--

01:12:44.747 --> 01:12:47.000
SAM: I will roll for Respa.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:47.880
She rolled a nine?

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.680
LAURA: Nein?

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.502
MARISHA: Nein!

01:12:49.502 --> 01:12:52.855
MATT: Nine plus-- she succeeds.

01:12:52.855 --> 01:12:53.840
(sighing)

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.880
It's the high wisdom.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.880
SAM: Why do I roll so good?

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.170
LAURA: You should
have let me do it.

01:12:58.170 --> 01:12:59.680
MATT: You can roll
for the other one

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.014
if you want, for the hell of it.

01:13:01.014 --> 01:13:03.150
SAM: Why don't you do this one?

01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:04.192
But use your shitty dice.

01:13:04.192 --> 01:13:04.992
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:13:04.992 --> 01:13:06.380
LAURA: Shut up, none of them
are shitty.

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.850
(laughter)

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:08.830
Three!

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:11.290
(laughter)

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:12.536
MATT: That cultist suddenly

01:13:12.536 --> 01:13:14.905
leans forward, and then turns
back and looks towards Pumat.

01:13:14.905 --> 01:13:16.735
He's like, "Hey, want
to help us out here?

01:13:16.735 --> 01:13:19.400
“Thanks, buddy."

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.000
That's going to be his turn.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.650
That brings us to-- you
hear this skittering

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:32.100
sound from the pillars above.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:32.900
SAM: Oh no!

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.170
MATT: And this growling bit.

01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:38.420
As you all
glance over the shoulder,

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:40.990
you can see claws
beginning to pull up,

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.325
and these strange, kind of
humanoid--

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:52.130
Imagine a dark,
greenish-colored demonic

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:55.280
creature, but the skin is
hanging and dangling

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.110
a bit off of its body.

01:13:57.110 --> 01:14:00.030
It has a snub nose,
almost like a mole.

01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:01.460
And it (gurgles].

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.280
And it begins to curl up, you
see multiples climbing up,

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.880
similar to when you've seen
previous rifts opened in spaces

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.933
throughout Wildemount.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.768
LAURA: Oh no, they got it open?

01:14:13.768 --> 01:14:15.310
SAM: Whoa, that's
a lot of figurines!

01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:16.815
TRAVIS: I think it's been open.

01:14:16.815 --> 01:14:17.615
Oh no!

01:14:17.615 --> 01:14:18.420
MARISHA: Shit!

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.090
SAM: What
fucking jerk is this?

01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:22.132
TRAVIS: So glad I didn't go
up that damn--

01:14:22.132 --> 01:14:24.950
I thought I was going
to be clever and go up.

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:27.963
Thus ends Fjord.

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:29.775
(laughter)

01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:34.536
MATT: They're
going to leap down.

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:38.390
They're not very quick,
so these leap off,

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:39.267
hit the ground--

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:40.101
LAURA: And splatter.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:42.696
They're really stupid.

01:14:42.696 --> 01:14:43.771
TALIESIN: I feel
like there's some dex

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:45.993
saves that have to happen here.
MATT: I'm getting into it.

01:14:45.993 --> 01:14:47.690
TALIESIN: Okay.
LIAM: I'mma dex save.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.327
SAM: Are there--

01:14:49.842 --> 01:14:51.931
Is there a door?

01:14:51.931 --> 01:14:53.390
Oh, is that a
staircase behind her?

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:55.390
TRAVIS: That's the way
it goes down there, yeah.

01:14:57.165 --> 01:14:59.540
MATT: All right, so that one
takes three points of damage

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:00.407
from the fall.

01:15:00.407 --> 01:15:02.241
TALIESIN: And then we
can lock it behind us.

01:15:02.241 --> 01:15:03.650
LIAM: Down below.
LAURA: Ooh!

01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:05.778
LIAM: (singing) Six feet under, down below.

01:15:05.778 --> 01:15:07.820
TALIESIN: So if we get in
there, it won't matter.

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.529
MATT: Gather
behind where they were.

01:15:09.529 --> 01:15:11.820
LAURA: Oh no, there's that many?
There's that many?!

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.690
MATT: The rest of
their movement

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:14.910
is going to go over here.

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:15.832
And they're going
to take their action

01:15:15.832 --> 01:15:17.220
to rush in and swarm Nott.

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.340
LAURA: Oh Traveler,
be with us! Please

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:22.425
save us from this humanity!

01:15:22.425 --> 01:15:24.380
MATT: These two are
going down as well.

01:15:27.535 --> 01:15:29.220
SAM: Why do they have red hands?

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.600
LAURA: They're covered in blood!

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.620
MATT: One of them takes
four points of damage.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.592
SAM: I hope.

01:15:35.592 --> 01:15:37.785
LAURA: Do they move in pairs?

01:15:37.785 --> 01:15:38.741
MATT: They're just rushing--

01:15:38.741 --> 01:15:40.366
they're
jumping off into space.

01:15:40.366 --> 01:15:41.533
LAURA: Are they like otters?

01:15:41.533 --> 01:15:43.200
They hold on to each
other so they don't

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.495
lose track of where they are?

01:15:44.495 --> 01:15:46.030
MATT: They're smaller than you.

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:47.155
They're like a medium size.

01:15:47.155 --> 01:15:48.380
They're about
waist high or so,

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.880
and they're just
skittering forward.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.030
LAURA: Oh no, they're cute!

01:15:53.788 --> 01:15:55.580
MATT: And they're going
to use their action

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.290
play to swim up on Beauregard.

01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:58.340
LAURA: I don't know.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:00.590
MATT: But they don't have
any action to attack you.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:02.420
These two leave off.

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:03.810
LAURA: Oh no!

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:06.320
MATT: I already rolled for
them, and they're fine.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.120
They move in,

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.745
and they're both
going to take attacks.

01:16:08.745 --> 01:16:10.045
And there's one more up here.

01:16:10.045 --> 01:16:13.090
And it's going to go ahead
and take a leap off as well.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:16.000
Yeah, he's fine, natural 20.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.600
He's going to rush
around to Fjord.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.018
So it's going to be
no attacks on Nott,

01:16:20.018 --> 01:16:21.560
because it took a
whilte to get them.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.019
No attacks on Beau,
because it took

01:16:23.019 --> 01:16:24.860
their action to get to you.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.840
Attack on Pumat,
and two on Fjord.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.090
How about attack-- no,
that's going to be a seven.

01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:35.100
That's a miss. Against
Fjord, a natural 20.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.293
SAM: Oh!

01:16:36.293 --> 01:16:37.595
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:16:37.595 --> 01:16:39.740
MATT: And a natural 20.

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:40.750
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:16:41.926 --> 01:16:43.100
MATT: Two in a row.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.840
TRAVIS: Well, getting
this party started.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.340
SAM: Does that mean
Travis Frederick

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.600
has to take back $500?

01:16:48.505 --> 01:16:49.380
Is that what happens?

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.255
MATT: Oh, and they
actually have two attacks.

01:16:51.255 --> 01:16:52.940
So we'll say that's
the first one.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:53.740
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:56.190
MATT: So you take eight
points of piercing damage.

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:56.990
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:16:56.990 --> 01:17:00.300
MATT: From the first critical.

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.540
They're not super strong.

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:06.570
And the other one, you take
12 points of piercing damage.

01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:07.370
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:08.356
MATT: And the other
one's going to attack,

01:17:08.356 --> 01:17:10.325
bite and claw you as well.
TRAVIS: All right.

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:12.920
MATT: That's going
to be a 16 to hit.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.015
TRAVIS: That misses.

01:17:14.015 --> 01:17:15.470
MATT: All right.

01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:18.251
And a 13 to hit.

01:17:18.251 --> 01:17:19.460
TRAVIS: Yeah, they both miss.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.260
SAM: Oh wow!

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:22.650
TRAVIS: On the two
melee hits that hit,

01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:29.220
the Star Razor pulses, and deals
seven points of radiant damage

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.020
to the attacker.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.360
MATT: Nice!

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.810
So with each strike
it bites at you,

01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:36.185
It bursts in its jaw,

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:38.600
and you see the lips
curl back from the radiant

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.440
burn that now sits
at the edge of its mouth.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.650
That finishes their turn.

01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:43.990
Caduceus, you're up.

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:46.010
TALIESIN: I'm going to
crawl through the hole.

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:52.660
MARISHA: Get in there, Caddy.
MATT: 15, you get right there.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.980
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep
moving against the wall

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:56.900
to the side, I think.

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.070
MATT: Okay.

01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.870
Over here?

01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:00.766
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going
to move against the wall

01:18:00.766 --> 01:18:01.727
so nothing can get behind me.

01:18:01.727 --> 01:18:03.100
MATT: 25, 30.
TALIESIN: All right.

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:03.900
MATT: Right there.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.260
TALIESIN: And I'm going
to take a Sacred Flame

01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:10.595
against the priestess.

01:18:10.595 --> 01:18:12.710
MATT: Which one?

01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:15.530
TALIESIN: The one that Beau
is attacking, the main one.

01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:16.330
MATT: Main one?

01:18:16.330 --> 01:18:17.325
What's the range
on Sacred Flame?

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:18.125
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:20.049
MATT: She is beyond 60 feet.
TALIESIN: Oh, where is she?

01:18:20.049 --> 01:18:21.510
MATT: She's right here.
TALIESIN: Oh, she ran?

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:23.670
MATT: Yeah, she went and moved
to the side of the pillar.

01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:24.878
She's about 90 feet from you.

01:18:24.878 --> 01:18:26.150
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:26.950
Well, heck.

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:28.150
LAURA: I know, I can't
see beyond that thing.

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:29.787
TRAVIS: Well, hecking heck.
TALIESIN: Well, hecking heck.

01:18:29.787 --> 01:18:31.370
SAM: Well, we're in
a church, we don't

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:32.579
want to say hell or anything.

01:18:32.579 --> 01:18:37.550
TALIESIN: Then I'm going
to hit one of the two

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:39.426
that's attacking Beau right now.

01:18:39.426 --> 01:18:40.685
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:18:40.685 --> 01:18:42.500
TALIESIN: That's a dex 17.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.871
MATT: That's a fail!

01:18:43.871 --> 01:18:44.865
TALIESIN: All right, so that's--

01:18:44.865 --> 01:18:45.845
TRAVIS: Fail!

01:18:45.845 --> 01:18:46.990
MARISHA: Fail!

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:48.986
SAM: Church!

01:18:48.986 --> 01:18:50.570
TALIESIN: 23 points
of radiant damage.

01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:51.370
MATT: All right.

01:18:51.370 --> 01:18:53.100
SAM: (singing) Christ is
born, Christ is risen.

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:53.900
MATT: 23 points?

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.480
TALIESIN: Wait, hold on,
(counting) 21.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.976
21 points of radiant damage.

01:18:58.976 --> 01:19:02.360
MATT: (whooshing) It
burns with the radiant flame,

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.971
and as the flame finally
flicks out of existence behind,

01:19:05.971 --> 01:19:07.430
there's just a hint
of charred bone

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:10.220
that clatters to the ground
and scatters into ash.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.830
That demonic creature destroyed
entirely from the Sacred Flame.

01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:14.070
SAM: Yay!
MARISHA: Thanks!

01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:15.010
SAM: One down.

01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:16.970
TALIESIN: So that's my move.

01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:18.680
MATT: All right.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.700
Top of the round.

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:20.690
Jester, you're up.

01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:22.482
LAURA: Oh, that's me.

01:19:22.482 --> 01:19:23.890
SAM: Oh, little old me?

01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:26.060
LAURA: Oh, little old me?

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:31.550
I'm going to-- hold on, let me
look at this thing real fast.

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:44.760
Okay, I'm going to number one, use
my Spiritual Weapon to attack

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.748
this thing that just attacked.

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.561
TRAVIS: This monstrosity.

01:19:47.561 --> 01:19:49.522
LAURA: Actually, no, I'm going
to move the Spiritual Weapon,

01:19:49.522 --> 01:19:52.030
and I'm going to go try to
get to one of the things that

01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.830
attacked Fjord.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:54.300
Because I saw he
took a pretty hard

01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:58.620
hit from that one that gave
him 12 damage, whichever one.

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.660
Then it's going to swing at him.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:05.580
And it's going to get a 20.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.100
MATT: That hits. Go ahead 
and roll damage.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.210
LAURA: (humming)

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:14.070
That is nine points.

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:15.398
MATT: Nice!

01:20:15.398 --> 01:20:16.198
It slams into her.

01:20:16.198 --> 01:20:18.576
(gurgling and screeching)
It makes a horrible sucking

01:20:18.576 --> 01:20:19.376
sound at the impact.

01:20:19.376 --> 01:20:21.220
TALIESIN: Still standing, even

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.574
after the seven
points on top of that?

01:20:22.574 --> 01:20:24.840
MATT: Oh, well, the one that
took seven damage was that one.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.370
You couldn't quite get
to that one in time.

01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:27.170
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:28.530
MATT: It's a 20-feet
movement, right, in the bonus?

01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:29.230
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:30.030
MATT: So it couldn’t quite get to them.

01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:31.530
The other one, this is
the first damage it's taken.

01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:32.620
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.640
LAURA: And then for
my attack, I'm

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:40.800
going to cast (singing) Guiding
Bolt. And my duplicate's

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.940
going pew, pew at the--

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.580
MATT: About 120 feet, right?

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:46.380
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.097
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

01:20:47.097 --> 01:20:48.720
Go ahead and roll an attack.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.410
LAURA: This is a 4th-
level, by the way.

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:51.210
20.

01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:53.791
MATT: 20, she does
have half cover

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:55.298
from going behind the
pillar, which gives her plus

01:20:55.298 --> 01:20:56.465
two to her armor class.

01:20:56.465 --> 01:20:57.882
LAURA: Oh, can I
move my duplicate

01:20:57.882 --> 01:20:59.580
to where I can move
it up here to where

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.330
it wouldn't get half cover?
MATT: Yeah.

01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:02.622
LAURA: Okay, yeah, let's do that.

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.590
MATT: That'll get her outside
of the half cover there.

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:08.850
LAURA: 20?
MATT: 20 hits.

01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:10.260
LAURA: Yeah!

01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:11.633
So that is--

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:14.085
(explosions)

01:21:14.085 --> 01:21:15.860
That is 7d6.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.890
SAM: Ooh, rough!

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:21.153
LAURA: Two, three
four, five, six.

01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:25.100
Okay.
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:25.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:35.930
LAURA: 10, 20, 21, and--
so 24 points of damage.

01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:37.740
MATT: And she is
currently radiating.

01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.230
As the blast hits her, (screams)
she falls to one knee,

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.765
and gets
up breathing hard.

01:21:41.765 --> 01:21:43.890
You can see a lot of the
robe has been burned away.

01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:46.050
The skin itself is
burned and charred.

01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:47.712
And the hair's
curled up on one side

01:21:47.712 --> 01:21:49.796
where part of the face is
now scarred from the impact

01:21:49.796 --> 01:21:51.193
of the radiant blast.
LAURA: Hair!

01:21:51.728 --> 01:21:53.978
LAURA: And then the next
attack on her gets advantage.

01:21:53.978 --> 01:21:54.960
MATT: Indeed.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.914
All right, that's your action.

01:21:55.914 --> 01:21:57.628
You want to move or stay put?

01:21:58.528 --> 01:21:59.800
LAURA: I'm going to stay put.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.800
SAM: And the next attack
on her gets advantage?

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.620
LAURA: Yes!

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:04.850
SAM: Do I know that?

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:06.730
MATT: She's glowing.

01:22:06.730 --> 01:22:08.970
So Nott, it's your turn.

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:13.080
SAM: I will bonus
action disengage,

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:18.410
slide between one of those
thing's legs and keep running.

01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:22.500
I'm going to run towards
the door behind the pew--

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.380
Whatever, the altar.

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:24.180
MATT: Right here?

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:27.360
SAM: And as I'm running,
I'm going to turn and shoot

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.800
the radiant glowing lady.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.890
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:32.846
SAM: 19.

01:22:32.846 --> 01:22:33.920
MATT: 19 just hits.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.720
LAURA: Ooh!

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.830
MATT: That was with
advantage right?

01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:36.830
LAURA: Yeah!
SAM: It is.

01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:38.220
MATT: Yeah, but just hits.

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:40.760
SAM: So I get sneak attack.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.340
(laughter)

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.935
MATT: You get sneak attack
because of the Guiding Bolt.

01:22:44.935 --> 01:22:46.016
(laughter)

01:22:46.016 --> 01:22:47.850
TRAVIS: (laughs) That
was fucking amazing.

01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:49.630
SAM: Let me try that again.

01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:51.360
I'll try that again.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.230
So I get sneak attack damage?

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:54.030
MATT: Yes. you do.

01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.990
(laughter)

01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:57.705
SAM: That one's cocked. Okay.

01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.010
TRAVIS: I thought one
went in your drink.

01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:04.575
SAM: 24 points of damage.

01:23:04.575 --> 01:23:05.950
MATT: How do you
want to do this?

01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:09.291
(cheering)

01:23:09.291 --> 01:23:13.590
SAM: I would like to shoot
her with a crossbow bolt.

01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:15.125
(laughter)

01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:17.250
But if possible, I'd love
it to go through her neck

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:19.233
and pin her to
the pillar behind her.

01:23:19.233 --> 01:23:20.150
TRAVIS: Oh, beautiful!

01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:21.170
SAM: Classic.

01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:23.608
MATT: So as you run by, she
turns and brings her hand up.

01:23:23.608 --> 01:23:25.150
She starts muttering,

01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:26.510
and the fingers start to glow.

01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:29.040
It's matching the
halo of radiant energy

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.900
that Jester had set you up with.

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:34.680
You aim your crossbow,
and for a split second,

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.895
you swear you see
a green hand

01:23:36.895 --> 01:23:39.270
touch the side of your
hand and correct your aim.

01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:40.070
SAM: Ooh!

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:41.250
MATT: And you fire.

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:42.625
And right as she
begins to cast--

01:23:42.625 --> 01:23:44.490
SAM: The Traveler molested me?

01:23:44.490 --> 01:23:45.630
In a church!

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.300
MATT: You see her eyes go wide,
as her arms go

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.035
limp to the side,
and blood just

01:23:50.035 --> 01:23:51.160
spills out of her mouth.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:51.960
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.342
MATT: And eventually, goes
limp, and just stays there.

01:23:54.342 --> 01:23:55.580
You can now see the
crossbow bolt holding

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.011
her locked against the pillar.

01:23:57.011 --> 01:23:58.459
(cheering)

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:01.583
LAURA: Did I see the hand help
Nott or did I not see that?

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:02.370
MATT: No, you're
way too far away.

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:03.210
LAURA: Damn it!

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:04.623
MATT: You've been
staying in the corner.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:06.290
LAURA: He did it, and
I didn't even see.

01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:07.873
I mean, he's just
doing it to be nice!

01:24:07.873 --> 01:24:09.125
SAM: Wow, that was so cool.

01:24:09.125 --> 01:24:11.430
MATT: All right, so that's you're
movement and your action.

01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:13.650
SAM: Yeah, and my bonus
as well, to disengage.

01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:14.450
MATT: Okay, yeah.

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:15.791
MARISHA: Fucking aim bots.

01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:17.365
MATT: You can get up
to here if you like.

01:24:17.365 --> 01:24:18.990
SAM: Great.
LAURA: Gets you every time.

01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.825
MARISHA: Goddamn it!

01:24:19.825 --> 01:24:22.230
MATT: That finishes Nott's turn.

01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:23.940
All right.

01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.730
Nott, as you get up to the
door, you sit there,

01:24:26.730 --> 01:24:27.760
looking around, and you hear--
SAM: Oh no.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.386
(heavy footsteps)

01:24:29.386 --> 01:24:30.483
SAM: Someone’s coming.
LAURA: Oh no.

01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:32.505
MATT: You turn back,
and the door (crashing).

01:24:32.505 --> 01:24:33.564
Make a dexterity
saving throw.

01:24:33.564 --> 01:24:35.162
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus Christ!
LAURA: Oh no, who is it?

01:24:35.162 --> 01:24:36.030
MARISHA: The Laughing Hand?

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:37.573
It's got to be the
Laughing Hand, right?

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:38.373
SAM: 16.

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:39.540
MATT: 16?

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:42.120
You do manage to move out
of the way just in time

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.514
as the doors slam open.

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:46.897
TALIESIN: I would also know if
Yasha is coming, by the way.

01:24:46.897 --> 01:24:48.480
I would be able to
sense any movement.

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.280
MATT: You sense her arrival.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.935
LAURA: Oh god!

01:24:51.405 --> 01:24:52.350
(explosion)

01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:55.170
(screaming)

01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:59.436
MATT: The Laughing Hand
comes barreling through.

01:24:59.436 --> 01:25:00.236
TRAVIS: (yelling) No!

01:25:00.236 --> 01:25:01.604
MATT: And right as it
moves past, you hear the--

01:25:01.604 --> 01:25:03.071
TRAVIS: (yelling) No!
(evil wheezing laughter)

01:25:03.071 --> 01:25:04.277
LAURA: Oh no!

01:25:04.277 --> 01:25:06.300
MATT: --that horrible laughing sound again.
You're like, shit, shit, shit!

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.415
SAM: Oh no!
MATT: Shit, shit!

01:25:07.415 --> 01:25:10.356
SAM: Oh no, I don't have time
to cover my ears or anything.

01:25:10.356 --> 01:25:11.860
LAURA: Oh shit!

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.100
MATT: Entering right after

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.090
and flying up behind the chamber.

01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:20.532
LAURA: I hate him!

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:21.332
MARISHA: Obann!

01:25:21.332 --> 01:25:23.787
MATT: It is Obann.

01:25:23.787 --> 01:25:25.187
Up to the top.
SAM: Oh no, it's on!

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:28.141
TRAVIS: Fuck it, this is it!

01:25:28.141 --> 01:25:28.901
This is it!

01:25:28.901 --> 01:25:31.138
MATT: And then, stepping
out, you see Yasha.

01:25:31.138 --> 01:25:32.222
TRAVIS: (screaming) Yasha!

01:25:32.222 --> 01:25:33.194
(screaming)

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:34.518
LIAM: Oh, she died!

01:25:34.518 --> 01:25:35.810
SAM: She fell down, she's dead.

01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:38.156
LAURA: No, she didn't, it's okay.

01:25:38.156 --> 01:25:41.417
MARISHA: Epic entrance. Dun dun—
(impacts).

01:25:41.417 --> 01:25:43.045
LIAM: And doesn't move again.

01:25:43.045 --> 01:25:44.300
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
Oh god.

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:45.180
Oh fuck.
Oh shit.

01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:45.980
Oh god.
Oh fuck.

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:46.500
Oh shit.
Oh god.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.300
LAURA: Here we go.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.447
MATT: Yasha, if
you wouldn't mind?

01:25:48.447 --> 01:25:50.180
(screaming)

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.346
TRAVIS: You fucking snake!

01:25:52.346 --> 01:25:54.338
LIAM: Kill her!

01:25:54.338 --> 01:25:55.334
Kill her!

01:25:55.334 --> 01:25:57.326
(laughter)

01:25:57.326 --> 01:25:59.638
(screaming)

01:25:59.638 --> 01:26:00.715
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:26:00.715 --> 01:26:02.134
LIAM: (yelling) Ashley's back!

01:26:02.134 --> 01:26:03.436
(cheering)

01:26:03.436 --> 01:26:06.076
SAM: Until the end of
this fight when she dies.

01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:08.400
TRAVIS: Hope you got
a backup character.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.991
You're going down!

01:26:09.991 --> 01:26:10.885
ASHLEY: I don't have
a backup character.

01:26:10.885 --> 01:26:11.969
SAM: Focus on Yasha first.

01:26:11.969 --> 01:26:13.814
ASHLEY: I’ll make one if I need to.

01:26:14.746 --> 01:26:17.620
TRAVIS: (panting)

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.213
TALIESIN: Nope.
LIAM: Oh man.

01:26:19.213 --> 01:26:19.702
TRAVIS: Please be
out of practice.

01:26:19.702 --> 01:26:21.400
Please be out of practice.
Please be out of practice.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:22.813
ASHLEY: When am I
not out of practice?

01:26:22.813 --> 01:26:24.407
(laughter)

01:26:24.407 --> 01:26:27.586
ASHLEY: Every time I sit at this
table, I'm like, what's D&amp;D?

01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:29.375
ASHLEY: Hi!
ALL: Hi!

01:26:29.375 --> 01:26:30.345
MATT: Hi, welcome back.

01:26:30.345 --> 01:26:31.660
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:33.112
MATT: You get to kill
your friends tonight.

01:26:33.112 --> 01:26:34.426
(cheering)

01:26:34.426 --> 01:26:35.840
TRAVIS: You certainly will try.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.303
MATT: So if you could initiative
for me, Yasha, as you're

01:26:38.303 --> 01:26:39.563
joining the initiative order.

01:26:39.563 --> 01:26:41.000
LAURA: Dispel, dispel!

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.990
SAM: I’m right behind all these people.

01:26:43.427 --> 01:26:44.962
MATT: There's a lot of battle to go yet.

01:26:45.935 --> 01:26:47.027
SAM: This is such an epic

01:26:47.027 --> 01:26:49.910
setting for this, though, Matt.
You did so good.

01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:54.870
MARISHA: I'm just standing on the
platform, watching the cavalry march in.

01:26:55.782 --> 01:26:56.990
(groaning)
(explosions)

01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:58.070
ASHLEY: Oh boy!

01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:59.650
Well, I get
advantage on that.

01:26:59.650 --> 01:27:02.211
TRAVIS: This is too fucking--
this is a shitshow.

01:27:02.211 --> 01:27:03.651
LAURA: You're attacking right away?
What are you doing?

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:04.451
ASHLEY: Shit.

01:27:04.451 --> 01:27:06.458
MATT: No, she's using her initiative.
ASHLEY: No, just doing initiative.

01:27:06.458 --> 01:27:07.570
LAURA: Oh.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.730
ASHLEY: What's my initiative?

01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:12.465
TRAVIS: I think
you get a plus one.

01:27:12.465 --> 01:27:14.090
LAURA: Come on in, Ashley.
ASHLEY: 13.

01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:16.132
TALIESIN: Come closer, closer.
MATT: 13, you say?

01:27:16.132 --> 01:27:17.450
ASHLEY: 13.
MATT: All right.

01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:19.220
ASHLEY: What a shocker,
I roll a low initiative.

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.767
MATT: You're going at
the same time as Pumat.

01:27:21.767 --> 01:27:22.698
SAM: (whispered) Ashley.

01:27:22.698 --> 01:27:24.395
LAURA: Scooch in.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:27:24.395 --> 01:27:25.455
I have room, guys.
I have room.

01:27:25.455 --> 01:27:26.455
MATT: All righty.

01:27:26.455 --> 01:27:28.970
So Nott finished, they emerge.

01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:30.015
Obann goes first.

01:27:30.015 --> 01:27:32.780
TRAVIS: Oh, it's amazing writing
Yasha in the initative order.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.235
ALL: Aww!

01:27:34.235 --> 01:27:35.205
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:27:35.205 --> 01:27:36.743
LAURA: Where was that in the--?

01:27:36.743 --> 01:27:38.567
That was after Nott went.
TRAVIS: Right after Pumat.

01:27:38.567 --> 01:27:40.400
LIAM: Caleb was about
to go, but Obann's in.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.200
MATT: Yes.

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.159
ASHLEY: I'm after Nott?

01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:42.980
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.516
TRAVIS: No, you're after Pumat.

01:27:44.516 --> 01:27:45.515
ASHLEY: After Pumat.

01:27:45.515 --> 01:27:46.640
SAM: You're way, way, late.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.410
LAURA: You're after Fjord, then?

01:27:49.410 --> 01:27:52.320
ASHLEY: So I have time to
read the player's handbook?

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.375
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:27:53.375 --> 01:27:54.430
LIAM: Learn D&amp;D, please.

01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:55.347
TRAVIS: Fifth Edition.

01:27:55.347 --> 01:27:58.790
SAM: So when the doors opened,
am I behind a door

01:27:58.790 --> 01:28:00.610
out of sight now?

01:28:02.242 --> 01:28:03.700
LAURA: That'd be awesome.
MATT: No.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.352
SAM: Okay, cool.
MATT: You haven't hidden.

01:28:05.352 --> 01:28:08.020
TRAVIS: Did we also see the
Inevitable End come out?

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:08.780
MATT: Nope.

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.460
ASHLEY: I'm 14.

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.960
14. Does that
change my initiative?

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.170
MATT: 14? It does.

01:28:13.170 --> 01:28:14.162
ASHLEY: Plus two to initiative.

01:28:14.162 --> 01:28:16.490
MATT: That puts you
actually before Fjord.

01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:17.935
LIAM: Palms are sweaty.

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.050
ASHLEY: Knees weak.

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.040
TRAVIS: We are not clocking the
Inevitable End yet, by the way.

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.730
LAURA: Oh, of course not.

01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:26.350
But you can see
invisible things.

01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:29.787
TRAVIS: I can, for an hour.

01:28:29.787 --> 01:28:30.830
But she doesn't
really go invisible.

01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:32.300
SAM: It's a she?

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:33.680
LAURA: She. She.

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.717
SAM: She comes
from underground?

01:28:36.717 --> 01:28:38.240
TRAVIS: She phases.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.556
MATT: So with Obann's turn,
Obann, pouring out and

01:28:42.572 --> 01:28:44.531
flying up in the air, is like,

01:28:44.531 --> 01:28:50.310
(chuckling)
"Good, more fodder."

01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:52.140
And as he looks
down with a grin,

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:56.085
he's going to go
ahead and try a--

01:28:56.785 --> 01:28:58.260
TRAVIS: You and
me both, brother.

01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.270
How many you got?

01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:00.840
LIAM: I'm okay for me.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:05.355
MATT: Just going to go ahead
and cast Dominate Person on--

01:29:08.067 --> 01:29:09.448
SAM: He knows us, too.

01:29:09.768 --> 01:29:11.105
MATT: --on you, Beauregard.

01:29:11.105 --> 01:29:13.406
MARISHA: Oh, I knew it!

01:29:13.406 --> 01:29:14.682
MATT: Can you go ahead and make
a wisdom saving throw for me, please?

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:15.380
LAURA: Come on, Beau!

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.905
You've got good wisdom now.

01:29:16.905 --> 01:29:18.010
SAM: Guidance.

01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:20.010
I am going to guide you.
LAURA: You can't. No--

01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:21.390
MATT: No, it doesn't--

01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:22.680
SAM: No?

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.180
Nott can't, on a
reaction, guide someone?

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:26.400
MATT: No, sorry.

01:29:27.068 --> 01:29:28.140
MARISHA: Oh fuck, fuck, fuck,

01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:29.830
fuck, fuck, fuck!
(groaning)

01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:30.801
TRAVIS: God!

01:29:31.581 --> 01:29:33.376
SAM: $500?
MARISHA: Seven.

01:29:33.376 --> 01:29:34.740
LAURA: Oh god!

01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:35.765
LIAM: Fuck.

01:29:36.185 --> 01:29:37.740
MARISHA: It was almost
like six and 18.

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:42.360
MATT: Beauregard, you look up
into Obann's eyes, as his hands

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:45.863
form this “come to me” finger motion.

01:29:45.863 --> 01:29:48.030
And you feel all of a sudden
your vision

01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:50.120
pull back into your head,
like the sunken place.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.840
MARISHA: I'm just
totally sunken place

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.910
MATT: And you lose
control of your body.

01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:55.710
All right.

01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:57.092
TRAVIS: 18 would have
been a lot better.

01:29:57.092 --> 01:29:58.630
MARISHA: Yeah, it would’ve.

01:29:58.630 --> 01:29:59.773
Yeah, it would’ve.

01:29:59.773 --> 01:30:00.860
MATT: Obann finishes his turn.

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.350
LAURA: She's charmed?

01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:05.830
MATT: She is charmed, and he can
take complete control of her.

01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:11.960
So you consider Obann an ally,
and the rest of them enemies.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.270
And as per Dominate
Person telepathic link,

01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:18.090
he can speak to you, and you
hear the voice in the head say,

01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:19.620
"Kill them all.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.690
“Kill them for the Angel.

01:30:21.690 --> 01:30:23.750
“Kill them for me."

01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:29.580
And yeah, your
general course of action

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:33.208
is to attack your friends.

01:30:33.208 --> 01:30:35.785
SAM: But like, just
with your shuriken.

01:30:36.355 --> 01:30:39.152
MATT: So Caleb, you're up.

01:30:39.152 --> 01:30:43.610
LIAM: Okay, I will use a bonus
action to have the Claw attempt

01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:45.360
to shred the one who stabs.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.170
So as he's stabbing into
me, I'm trying to back away,

01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:50.487
and doing this with my hand, and
drawing the Claw to shred him.

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:52.820
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll
for the attack for the Claw.

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:53.779
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:53.779 --> 01:30:55.550
SAM: Claw is still
out, that's great.

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:56.900
LIAM: That is a 21 to hit.

01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.310
MATT: That hits.

01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:04.010
LIAM: Oh good, 23.

01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.970
MATT: 23 points?

01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:07.875
LIAM: Slashing damage, yeah.

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:11.645
MATT: Yeah, okay.

01:31:11.645 --> 01:31:12.855
LAURA: Is that on Obann?

01:31:13.445 --> 01:31:15.970
LIAM: No, it's the one who was
stabbing the shit out of me.

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:18.350
MATT: He just gets
carved into ribbons.

01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:19.222
LIAM: Oh good.

01:31:19.222 --> 01:31:21.610
MATT: (screeching) And
crumples to the ground.

01:31:21.610 --> 01:31:23.595
The claw's just--
you see him fall

01:31:23.595 --> 01:31:24.720
into four different pieces.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.870
LIAM: Okay, and Caleb starts to
smear his blood on the ground

01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:31.870
as he crawls this
way just five feet.

01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:34.960
And he'll get-- this way,
just five feet that way

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:36.910
so I can see a little bit.

01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:41.860
And in all the tumult, the
hands clap together again.

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:44.540
(whooshing) And
another fireball flies

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:48.460
out just to the side of that
candlestick, diagonally maybe.

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:50.960
Yeah, we're going to get-- no,
no, closer to this guy right

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:53.310
here, and those guys over there.

01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:54.580
Yeah.
MATT: Right there?

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.038
LIAM: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:56.038 --> 01:31:57.496
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:57.496 --> 01:32:00.625
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

01:32:00.625 --> 01:32:02.990
(laughter)

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:06.046
TRAVIS: Place your
mushroom cloud.

01:32:06.046 --> 01:32:08.145
MATT: Laughing Hand...

01:32:08.165 --> 01:32:10.135
rolls an 11. That’s a fail.

01:32:10.135 --> 01:32:13.630
LIAM: 26 points of fire damage,
so it's just a 3rd-level.

01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:15.900
MATT: He takes half that.

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.462
Actually, no he does not,
because he lost his resistances.

01:32:18.462 --> 01:32:19.346
LAURA: (gasping)

01:32:19.346 --> 01:32:21.330
TRAVIS: Because we kill
the fucking heart.

01:32:21.330 --> 01:32:22.781
(cheering)

01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:23.960
SAM: This is a fireball?

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:26.217
LIAM: Fireball.
SAM: What’s the DC?

01:32:26.217 --> 01:32:27.561
LAURA: Because it got you? Did it get you?

01:32:27.561 --> 01:32:29.186
LIAM: It’s a 17.

01:32:29.186 --> 01:32:32.060
MATT: No, actually, he managed
to aim it so it did not hit Nott.

01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:32.930
SAM: Oh, ho, ho, ho!

01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:33.730
Thank god.

01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:35.796
MATT: You feel the heat, and
you're like, close your eyes!

01:32:35.796 --> 01:32:38.840
And the fire just
barely licks past.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.285
Your eyebrows recoil a bit.

01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:43.285
SAM: Beautiful
tattooed eyebrows.

01:32:43.285 --> 01:32:45.210
MATT: That's a failure there.

01:32:45.210 --> 01:32:47.350
(whooshing) Incinerates.

01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:49.740
Screams as the Spiritual
Weapon that they had summoned

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:50.540
vanishes.

01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:54.450
LIAM: Wisdom save for me.

01:32:54.450 --> 01:32:55.250
MATT: All right.

01:32:58.138 --> 01:33:00.070
Which is...?

01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:01.160
LIAM: I get a 14.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:01.960
MATT: 14?

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.690
Yeah, so this is a level five
spell, so 13 was the DC,

01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:07.270
so you succeed.

01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:08.070
All right.

01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:09.050
LAURA: That was a
level three spell.

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:09.850
LIAM: Yeah.

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:10.650
LAURA: Yeah.

01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:11.880
MATT: Fail.

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:15.486
It takes half damage
because it has resistance.

01:33:15.486 --> 01:33:17.866
LAURA: Oh, the little things
are resistant to fire.

01:33:17.866 --> 01:33:19.443
SAM: Oh, the little creatures?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:33:19.443 --> 01:33:20.860
TRAVIS: Because
they're from Hell.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:21.777
LIAM and SAM: Yeah!

01:33:21.777 --> 01:33:23.085
MATT: From the Abyss, actually.

01:33:23.085 --> 01:33:24.490
TRAVIS: From Abyss!

01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:25.900
(laughter)

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:28.480
MATT: Fails.

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.850
And half damage there,
and then that just

01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:33.220
there fails, but
did not take damage

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.871
from your previous fireball.

01:33:34.871 --> 01:33:35.830
LIAM: I don't think so.

01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:36.955
MATT: Because it had rushed through.

01:33:36.955 --> 01:33:39.366
So that takes a full 26.

01:33:39.366 --> 01:33:41.880
SAM: Ashley Fricking
Johnson at the table!

01:33:42.755 --> 01:33:46.490
LIAM: And so I used 15 feet--
half my movement-- to stand?

01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:47.290
MATT: Correct.

01:33:47.290 --> 01:33:48.590
LIAM: And move
five feet that way?

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:51.140
So I have 10 left,
I'm going a-that way 10 feet.

01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:53.701
MARISHA: Going a-that a-way-a!

01:33:53.701 --> 01:33:56.365
LIAM: It's like
there's two of us.

01:33:56.365 --> 01:33:58.940
MATT: All right,
behind the edge there.

01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:00.230
Got it, all right.

01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:01.030
LIAM: That's it.

01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:04.300
MATT: That finishes
your go there.

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:08.106
Next up, the cultists.

01:34:08.106 --> 01:34:10.885
LIAM: Oh boy.

01:34:10.885 --> 01:34:12.236
MATT: This guy rushes up here.

01:34:12.236 --> 01:34:14.236
LIAM: Sure.

01:34:14.236 --> 01:34:15.415
MATT: And this guy--

01:34:15.415 --> 01:34:16.585
TALIESIN: Who is one of us.

01:34:16.585 --> 01:34:18.085
MATT: --is Dominated,
is going to go

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:23.240
ahead and try to attack the
one that's outside of Pumat.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.120
LIAM: Oh my goodness!

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.730
MATT: Attack on that one.

01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:29.590
It's a natural 20.

01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:30.960
SAM: Oh, that's
good, that's good.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.295
MATT: And 15, both hit.

01:34:34.955 --> 01:34:35.837
MARISHA: Leave
a penny, take a penny.

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:36.637
SAM: Yeah!

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:39.290
MARISHA: You know, you lose
a Beau, you gain a cultist.

01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:41.674
LIAM: Leave a cultist, take a cultist.
LAURA: I just don’t think they’re equal.

01:34:42.854 --> 01:34:46.000
TRAVIS: How do you break the--
Does she save against it each round?

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.142
MARISHA: It’s okay.

01:34:48.142 --> 01:34:52.131
MATT: So it’s 15 points of
damage to that one.

01:34:52.131 --> 01:34:54.090
So it carves into that
one there with a dagger.

01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:56.522
(whooshing) And the
creature goes (snarling).

01:34:56.522 --> 01:34:59.410
He crawls back looking
confused and angry,

01:34:59.410 --> 01:35:01.040
as the cultist's
eyes are still wide

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.040
and smiling while looking
at Pumat, like, "Hey!"

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.770
Pumat’s like, "Yeah, that's right."

01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:12.040
The other one that's over there
is going to attack you, Caleb.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.440
Two attacks with you.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.570
The first is going to be a 14.

01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:17.370
LIAM: Misses.

01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:18.170
MATT: Misses?

01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:21.240
Second one, that's
going to be a 15.

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:22.835
LIAM: Shield.

01:35:22.835 --> 01:35:24.460
MATT: (whooshing)
Shield a second time.

01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:25.840
(whooshing) Reflected off.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.580
The dagger scrapes
off of the outside

01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:29.300
of the arcane energy shield.

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:30.730
No impact.

01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:33.970
All right, that finishes the
cultists’ turn at that point.

01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:36.070
That brings us to Beauregard.

01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.870
Beauregard.

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:37.670
LIAM: Have fun.

01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:43.900
MARISHA: So as I look at Obann
and he says, “Kill them all,”

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:47.120
and I start to slip
into the Sunken Place,

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.380
and I feel the darkness come
through like tunnel vision.

01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:53.260
And then I just close my
eyes, and I resist.

01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:57.660
When I open them, I am
sitting next to the ocean

01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:00.085
in Nicodranas, meditating.

01:36:00.085 --> 01:36:03.150
(deep breath)

01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:07.350
And I breathe, and I'm going
to use Stillness of Mind

01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:09.200
to end a charm effect.

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.094
(cheering)

01:36:10.094 --> 01:36:11.360
MATT: Right!

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.481
That's right!

01:36:12.481 --> 01:36:13.574
LIAM: Fuck yeah!

01:36:14.434 --> 01:36:15.460
MATT: I forgot you had that.

01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.340
LAURA: Oh!

01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.605
TALIESIN: What?
LIAM: Man!

01:36:18.045 --> 01:36:19.205
TALIESIN: What?

01:36:19.205 --> 01:36:21.500
LIAM: Fuck, I want one too,
give it, give it, give it.

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:22.770
LAURA: Yes!

01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:26.610
MARISHA: And I open back, and
I look at him, and I just go--

01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:27.930
(laughter)

01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:31.908
MATT: You see him like, (growls).
Just grow angry.

01:36:31.908 --> 01:36:33.632
SAM: Oh, ho, ho, ho!
MATT: That's your action.

01:36:33.632 --> 01:36:35.090
TRAVIS: He's going
to light you up.

01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:36.882
MARISHA: That's my
action? (laughs) Yeah.

01:36:36.882 --> 01:36:38.085
LIAM: Nice work, Danvers!

01:36:38.085 --> 01:36:39.950
TRAVIS: Wake up, wake up, wake up!

01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:43.105
MATT: Just fucking
Robotech missile her.

01:36:43.105 --> 01:36:45.060
(laughter)

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:47.230
LIAM: (yelling) No wing on flap!

01:36:47.230 --> 01:36:51.740
MARISHA: Harnessing that
stillness and that peace,

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.540
I'm going to just look around.

01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:55.535
I'm going to look
at Laughing Hand,

01:36:55.535 --> 01:37:02.690
look at the demon behind me,
and do Patient Defense again.

01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:07.165
And I could theoretically
move, but then

01:37:07.165 --> 01:37:09.533
he would get an attack, right?
MATT: Both of them would, yeah.

01:37:09.533 --> 01:37:10.700
MARISHA: Both of them would.

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.367
MATT: You are within
range of his blade.

01:37:12.367 --> 01:37:16.055
MARISHA: I use Patient
Defense and hold strong.

01:37:16.055 --> 01:37:16.910
MATT: Okay.

01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:18.140
As you do, you get--

01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:22.712
Because you're naturally--
what your passive perception?

01:37:22.712 --> 01:37:23.530
MARISHA: 13.

01:37:23.530 --> 01:37:24.410
MATT: 13?

01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:25.511
Okay.

01:37:25.511 --> 01:37:27.147
The Laughing Hand-- as
it's stepped up,

01:37:27.147 --> 01:37:28.730
you're the one who
can see it,

01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:30.897
and it's like breathing heavy.
It's like (wheezing).

01:37:30.897 --> 01:37:32.768
SAM: Oh no!

01:37:32.768 --> 01:37:33.810
He's having a rough time.

01:37:33.810 --> 01:37:35.550
MARISHA: Is he sickly?

01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:36.557
SAM: Go easy on him.

01:37:36.557 --> 01:37:37.890
MARISHA: What a baby.
SAM: Yeah.

01:37:37.890 --> 01:37:39.932
MATT: All right, that
finishes Beauregard's turn,

01:37:39.932 --> 01:37:41.130
and it's now Yasha's turn.

01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:42.022
SAM: (gasps)

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:44.070
First move back! What's it going to be?

01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:45.525
ASHLEY: Okay, okay! 
LAURA: God!

01:37:45.525 --> 01:37:46.900
MATT: You're
probably right here.

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:48.858
ASHLEY: --closest to?
Is that Nott right there?

01:37:48.858 --> 01:37:50.335
MATT: Nott is just to the right.

01:37:50.335 --> 01:37:51.250
SAM: Hi!

01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:52.940
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay.

01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:54.170
SAM: Please don't kill me!

01:37:57.978 --> 01:38:01.160
ASHLEY: So I would like to rage.

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.798
MATT: Okay.

01:38:03.798 --> 01:38:07.430
You see Yasha flex angrily with
that face turning into a dour,

01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:08.240
gritted expression.

01:38:11.162 --> 01:38:14.480
ASHLEY: I'm going
to turn to my right,

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:17.570
and I am going to take
out my Skingorger.

01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:19.070
MATT: Okay.

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:22.895
The horrible, rusted-looking,
giant, thick, jagged blade

01:38:22.895 --> 01:38:23.695
in both hands.

01:38:23.695 --> 01:38:25.370
ASHLEY: And I'm going
to stare at Nott,

01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:26.891
and I am going to
attack reckless.

01:38:26.891 --> 01:38:27.691
SAM: (whimpering)

01:38:27.691 --> 01:38:30.734
MATT: All right, go for it.

01:38:32.075 --> 01:38:32.969
LAURA: Ooh.

01:38:32.969 --> 01:38:33.870
Ooh!

01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:36.170
Ooh!

01:38:36.170 --> 01:38:37.929
ASHLEY: I rolled two ones.

01:38:37.929 --> 01:38:42.619
(cheering)

01:38:42.619 --> 01:38:44.500
ASHLEY: (yelling) Off to a good start!

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:47.824
(laughter)

01:38:47.824 --> 01:38:49.915
LIAM: Oh, so many
levels of awesome!

01:38:49.915 --> 01:38:51.735
TRAVIS: (yelling) Thank you, Ashley!

01:38:51.735 --> 01:38:53.320
TALIESIN: Oh man!

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.435
MATT: You had one job!

01:38:54.435 --> 01:38:56.000
ASHLEY: I had one job.
(laughter)

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:56.925
Snake eyes!

01:38:56.925 --> 01:39:00.560
SAM: I’m going to make puppy dog eyes at her.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.540
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:02.340
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:03.245
LIAM: Wow!

01:39:03.245 --> 01:39:07.453
ASHLEY: As a bonus action,
I am-- oh, no, no, no,

01:39:07.453 --> 01:39:09.120
never mind because I raged.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:09.920
Okay.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.486
I'll stay.

01:39:15.486 --> 01:39:17.350
(laughter)

01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:18.350
I'm going to stay there.

01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:21.170
MATT: All right, that
finishes your turn.

01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:22.465
Fjord, you're up.

01:39:22.465 --> 01:39:25.250
You see Yasha come out, angrily
rage, and then rush over

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:26.448
and swing twice
towards Nott. Nott,

01:39:26.448 --> 01:39:28.820
like (shrieking)
backing out of the way, dodging.

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.612
The blade is sparking
against the stonework

01:39:30.612 --> 01:39:31.920
that's holding the door frame.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.720
What are you doing?

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.600
TRAVIS: With my bonus
action, I will put

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.515
my Hexblade's Curse on Obann.

01:39:38.515 --> 01:39:40.281
MATT: Okay.

01:39:40.281 --> 01:39:42.420
LAURA: What does that do?

01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:44.990
TRAVIS: 19 or 20 is a
critical hit against him.

01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:48.155
It's extra damage, and
just a slew of other shit.

01:39:48.155 --> 01:39:50.030
LAURA: 19 to 20 for
anybody, or just for you?

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:51.197
SAM: Just for me.
LAURA: Okay.

01:39:54.278 --> 01:39:55.345
MATT: All right.

01:39:55.345 --> 01:39:58.130
TRAVIS: And I will
look up at Obann

01:39:58.130 --> 01:40:02.650
and say: Looks like
this is an aerial fight.

01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:05.150
I'll point up in the sky,
and my eyes will roll back,

01:40:05.150 --> 01:40:08.982
and I'll say: It's
time to vrock.

01:40:08.982 --> 01:40:11.220
And I will summon a vrock.

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:12.700
(laughter)

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:13.523
SAM: A vrock?

01:40:13.523 --> 01:40:15.870
TRAVIS: (laughs) So I
Summon a Greater Demon.

01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:18.348
(laughter)

01:40:18.348 --> 01:40:20.708
SAM: (falsetto) Let's
get ready to vrock!

01:40:20.708 --> 01:40:22.772
LIAM: You got to
do that every time.

01:40:22.772 --> 01:40:23.572
(laughter)

01:40:23.572 --> 01:40:26.155
TALIESIN: I think that adds
a d4 for the pun damage.

01:40:26.155 --> 01:40:26.985
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

01:40:26.985 --> 01:40:28.569
LIAM: Yeah, but
that goes to Matt.

01:40:28.569 --> 01:40:31.630
MARISHA: Oh, I could hear
the electric guitar riff.

01:40:31.630 --> 01:40:34.470
SAM and TALIESIN: (imitating guitar solo)

01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:35.530
MATT: All right.

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:36.330
LAURA: So stupid.

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:37.130
SAM: Whoa!

01:40:37.130 --> 01:40:41.680
MATT: We see this large, creepy,
vulture-like demonic entity

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:44.260
appear, its skin covered
in harsh feathers,

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.740
and this sickly-looking
scaled hide to the parts that

01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:50.335
aren't covered by the feathers,

01:40:50.335 --> 01:40:53.620
with giant wings,
long beak, claws.

01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.960
All right, so go right ahead.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:57.090
TRAVIS: I roll
initiative for it, right?

01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:59.157
MATT: It should
say in the spell.

01:40:59.157 --> 01:41:00.991
TRAVIS: I think it rolls
its own initiative.

01:41:03.730 --> 01:41:05.980
Okay.

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:08.503
It's a two.

01:41:08.503 --> 01:41:10.420
TALIESIN: It actually
means it goes very soon.

01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:11.258
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does.

01:41:11.258 --> 01:41:13.035
It goes about right up--
or, right after you.

01:41:13.035 --> 01:41:14.740
TALIESIN: Right with me.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.054
MATT: All right, so
keep track of that.

01:41:16.054 --> 01:41:17.474
TRAVIS: I will, thank you.
TALIESIN: It can go first.

01:41:17.474 --> 01:41:19.733
MATT: It goes with
Caduceus, right.

01:41:19.733 --> 01:41:21.400
All right.
TRAVIS: No, you can go first.

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.045
TALIESIN: No, please
let it go first.

01:41:23.045 --> 01:41:25.668
MATT: Fjord, that's your action.
You have your movement, and your bonus.

01:41:25.668 --> 01:41:27.160
Oh, you used your bonus
for the Hexblade. Nevermind.

01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:29.227
So stay put, or
you going to move?

01:41:29.227 --> 01:41:31.030
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay
put so I don't incur a bunch

01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:32.215
of attacks of opportunity.

01:41:32.215 --> 01:41:33.340
MATT: Okay.

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:36.860
That brings us to Pumat's turn.

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:38.930
Pumat is still
controlling the guy.

01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:41.800
He's going to go, "All
right, this is getting

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:42.940
“a little out of hand here."

01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:44.980
You see him look a little
scared at the presence

01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:47.440
of all these creatures around.

01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:52.200
He's going to go ahead and...

01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.810
he's going to cast Acid Arrow at 5th-level.

01:41:59.810 --> 01:42:00.905
LAURA: 5th-level?

01:42:00.905 --> 01:42:02.820
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:06.290
And he's going to go ahead and
fire it at the Laughing Hand.

01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:08.540
Because that's, from his
perspective, the scariest guy

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.380
right now.

01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:10.297
LAURA: Understandably.

01:42:10.297 --> 01:42:11.506
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:42:11.506 --> 01:42:14.551
SAM: There's a lot of crazy
shit going on in this place.

01:42:14.551 --> 01:42:15.551
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.380
LAURA: Yeah.

01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:21.020
SAM: There's
cultists and skeleton

01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:25.543
men and giant blade-hand men.

01:42:25.543 --> 01:42:26.960
LAURA: We still
don't know where--

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:27.760
SAM: A cat?

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.120
LAURA: We still don't know
where the Inevitable End is.

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:30.920
SAM: Oh no.

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.935
TRAVIS: No, we don't.

01:42:31.935 --> 01:42:33.280
LIAM: She might be at a spa.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:36.410
LAURA: Maybe she's just
chilling, you know?

01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:39.910
She had a fight. Maybe her and Obann had a fight.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
LIAM: Maybe she’s embarrassed. Too embarrassed to fight.

01:42:44.110 --> 01:42:46.320
MATT: 14 points of acid
damage to the Laughing Hand.

01:42:49.050 --> 01:42:54.130
And he's going to go ahead and
burn a little more on his turn.

01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:56.090
Pumat, surrounded
by these things,

01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:57.475
sees the big guy burst through.

01:42:57.475 --> 01:42:58.517
It looks extremely scary.

01:42:58.517 --> 01:42:59.430
He goes, "No, no, no!

01:42:59.430 --> 01:43:03.510
“No, no, ah, da--" and releases
this dart of green energy

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:06.720
that fires forward, splatters
into him and (whooshing)

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:11.090
begins to burn and singe
the somewhat sagging

01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:12.248
flesh covered in mouths.

01:43:12.248 --> 01:43:13.790
As it splatters and
burns, the mouths

01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:16.010
that were laughing
gargle a bit as it

01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:17.910
enters their interior.

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.908
He's going to risk an
attack of opportunity.

01:43:23.908 --> 01:43:26.450
Because he does not like being
here, and he's having that guy

01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:30.650
controlled, so he’s going to move,
one, two, three, four, six.

01:43:30.650 --> 01:43:31.925
Both of them get attacks on him.

01:43:31.925 --> 01:43:36.900
The first one--
yeah, that'll hit.

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:37.700
It takes--

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:39.884
TRAVIS: No, Pumat!

01:43:39.884 --> 01:43:43.400
MATT: Six points
of slashing damage,

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.560
and he has to make a
constitution saving throw,

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.360
which he makes.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:48.920
So he maintains the domination.

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:51.590
Other attack against him misses.

01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:55.130
So he swoops by, "Oh,
all right, all right."

01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:57.642
And he hears the doors behind
starting to unlock from

01:43:57.642 --> 01:43:58.851
the chamber you guys skipped.

01:43:58.851 --> 01:44:01.340
LAURA: Oh no, those dudes.

01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:03.020
MATT: All right,
finishing his turn.

01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:04.720
It is now these guys' turns.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.470
SAM: Wait, where?

01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:08.345
LAURA: The other cultists
coming from the front.

01:44:08.345 --> 01:44:09.720
SAM: Oh no, the
ones we skipped?

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.520
LAURA: Yeah.

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.520
SAM: But we skipped that board!

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:13.320
They're out it.

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.590
MARISHA: It's done,
there's no more.

01:44:14.590 --> 01:44:16.351
TRAVIS: It's a scrolling game. You can’t go back.

01:44:16.351 --> 01:44:17.850
It's Super Mario Brothers.

01:44:17.893 --> 01:44:20.268
MATT: There's a cultist blocking the other thing.
They'll rush up to Nott.

01:44:20.268 --> 01:44:21.893
They're both going
to attack you, Nott.

01:44:21.893 --> 01:44:26.730
The first one-- it's
going to be a 12.

01:44:26.730 --> 01:44:28.020
SAM: Miss!

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:28.820
Dodge.

01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:30.320
MATT: The first
attack, they do have

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:34.160
advantage on you, because you're
currently flanking with Yasha.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.970
SAM: Okay.

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:40.655
MATT: The second attack from
that one is going to be 13.

01:44:40.655 --> 01:44:42.412
SAM: Dodge.

01:44:42.412 --> 01:44:44.230
MATT: This one here
is currently flanking

01:44:44.230 --> 01:44:46.810
with the Laughing Hand.

01:44:46.810 --> 01:44:48.480
And that's going to be a 16.

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:49.500
SAM: Miss.

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.710
MATT: And the other
one's going to be a 19.

01:44:51.710 --> 01:44:52.510
SAM: Hit!

01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:54.437
MATT: Oh my god! One of them got you!
SAM: Yes.

01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:56.375
MATT: I'm so excited!
SAM: Yes.

01:44:56.375 --> 01:45:01.109
MATT: You take 7 points
of piercing damage

01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:03.068
as it bites into your
shoulder, and latches on.

01:45:03.068 --> 01:45:05.443
You shrug it off,
and you feel the teeth

01:45:05.443 --> 01:45:06.950
drag across the
side of your arm,

01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:10.860
and you can feel the blood
-- oof-- beneath your armor.

01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:13.338
SAM: Uncanny Dodge that,
or save my reaction?

01:45:13.338 --> 01:45:15.680
I'm going to save my
reaction for something else.

01:45:16.625 --> 01:45:19.140
MATT: Three of them are going to
be attacking you, Fjord.

01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:25.090
This one’s going to move this way
to get over to you in flanking.

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.410
And that's going to stay there.

01:45:26.410 --> 01:45:31.230
So the two that are in
flanking-- first attack, 13.

01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:32.030
TRAVIS: Miss.

01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:33.530
MATT: The next one is 15?

01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:34.890
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:45:34.890 --> 01:45:36.070
MATT: So that's one's done.

01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:39.920
The one across the way--
the first attack, 17?

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.970
TRAVIS: That is my AC.

01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:43.040
MATT: So it hits you.

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.290
You take five points of slashing
damage from a claw strike.

01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:47.481
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:45:47.481 --> 01:45:50.893
I think I have to make a thing
to maintain the spell, right?

01:45:50.893 --> 01:45:52.810
MATT: Yes, you do, a
constitution saving throw.

01:45:52.810 --> 01:45:55.830
TRAVIS: And I have advantage on
that, because I have the thing.

01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:58.347
MATT: War Caster.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:45:58.347 --> 01:46:00.680
That is a 16.
MATT: You're fine.

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:01.620
Also, roll your damage.

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:03.735
Because it struck you while
you had the blade out.

01:46:03.735 --> 01:46:04.860
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you, yes.

01:46:07.375 --> 01:46:08.750
TALIESIN: I like
this I'm rubber,

01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:10.208
you're glue thing
you got going on.

01:46:10.208 --> 01:46:12.291
TRAVIS: Five points of
radiant damage on that one.

01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:14.784
MATT: (whooshing) He pulls back,
goes in for a secondary attack,

01:46:14.784 --> 01:46:16.040
which is a bite attack.

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:16.840
18.

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:17.895
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:46:17.895 --> 01:46:21.770
MATT: You take seven points
of piercing damage, as it

01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:24.080
bites into the side
of your hip as you

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:25.190
try to swing back around.

01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:27.190
TRAVIS: He takes eight
points of radiant damage.

01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:28.065
MATT: That kills him.

01:46:28.065 --> 01:46:29.646
(cheering)

01:46:29.646 --> 01:46:30.650
He bites on you.

01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:34.160
(whooshing) And the blast
back causes his head to just

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.755
scatter across the ground.

01:46:35.755 --> 01:46:37.130
The body (thudding)

01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:39.770
on to the floor behind you
across the marble floor.

01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:41.450
TRAVIS: Oh, that's fine. 22.

01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:42.450
MATT: 22, you're fine.

01:46:42.450 --> 01:46:44.742
And that one gets two attacks
on you without advantage.

01:46:44.742 --> 01:46:46.450
The first one is
going to be a 20.

01:46:46.450 --> 01:46:47.250
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:46:47.250 --> 01:46:48.620
MATT: All right.

01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:51.023
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to
use my reaction to counter that.

01:46:51.023 --> 01:46:53.300
MATT: To counter what?
It wasn't a natural 20.

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.810
MATT: It was a 20 total.

01:46:54.810 --> 01:46:55.610
You're fine.

01:46:55.610 --> 01:46:57.330
Four points of slashing damage,

01:46:57.330 --> 01:46:58.610
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:00.970
Five points of radiant to him.

01:47:00.970 --> 01:47:03.930
MATT: Five points of radiant to him.

01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:04.730
And then?

01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:06.064
TRAVIS: Totally save, it's a 24.

01:47:06.064 --> 01:47:07.410
MATT: Okay, second attack--

01:47:07.410 --> 01:47:08.670
it's a natural one.
Misses!

01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:09.770
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:11.390
MATT: All right,
that ends their turn.

01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:13.134
That brings us to--

01:47:13.134 --> 01:47:14.586
(laughs)

01:47:16.038 --> 01:47:17.490
LAURA: No!

01:47:17.490 --> 01:47:18.458
LIAM: Here she comes.

01:47:18.458 --> 01:47:23.520
LAURA: (singing) Here she
comes, walking in the chapel.

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:27.610
LIAM: Nein, nein, crazy nein.

01:47:27.610 --> 01:47:29.480
MATT: She wouldn’t go too far
out, so it's going to be you,

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:31.480
Fjord, unfortunately.
LIAM: Damn it.

01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:32.438
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:47:32.438 --> 01:47:34.060
SAM: Oh no!

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:36.450
There she comes!

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:38.110
MATT: Up from the
ground, (whooshing)

01:47:38.110 --> 01:47:41.182
you hear this faint grinding sound.

01:47:41.182 --> 01:47:43.391
And before you have a moment
to even look behind you,

01:47:43.391 --> 01:47:45.970
she's going to
attempt to attack you.

01:47:45.970 --> 01:47:47.780
This is going to be...

01:47:52.690 --> 01:47:53.830
21.

01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:55.490
TRAVIS: Hits.
MATT: All right.

01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:59.095
And the second attack with
the Spectral Blade is a 26.

01:47:59.095 --> 01:48:00.940
TRAVIS: Yes, they both hit.
SAM: Oh no!

01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:02.700
Oh no!

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.930
MATT: She takes 11 damage?

01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:06.930
TRAVIS: Yes, 11 radiant.

01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:08.022
MATT: Got it, from both attacks.

01:48:08.022 --> 01:48:10.320
The first one is going to do--

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:20.260
SAM: Ooh boy, that's a lot of dice rattling over there.

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.570
Ashley, how's it feel?

01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:22.785
ASHLEY: It feels good.

01:48:22.785 --> 01:48:24.385
SAM: Yeah?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:48:24.385 --> 01:48:25.725
SAM: So far you're doing great.

01:48:25.725 --> 01:48:28.120
ASHLEY: Thank you very much.

01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:31.340
I really was trying
for double ones.

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:32.600
(laughter)

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:33.840
TRAVIS: You did a great job.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:34.640
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.670
TRAVIS: Mission success.

01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:36.670
ASHLEY: Mission success.

01:48:36.670 --> 01:48:37.712
LIAM: Charity drive time.

01:48:37.712 --> 01:48:41.660
MATT: 45 points of
piercing damage to you.

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:43.300
LAURA: I hate her!
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:44.740
MATT: I need you go ahead--

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:47.982
TRAVIS: It was saved with a 21.

01:48:47.982 --> 01:48:49.710
MATT: A 21 on the what?

01:48:49.710 --> 01:48:51.675
TRAVIS: On the spell maintaining--

01:48:51.675 --> 01:48:53.140
MATT: 21 I don't think succeeds.

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:55.140
TRAVIS: Oh, really?
MATT: 45-- I mean, 22 is DC. It's half.

01:48:55.625 --> 01:48:56.895
So you actually lose
your concentration

01:48:56.895 --> 01:48:59.386
on your spell, which means
the demon remains out there.

01:48:59.386 --> 01:49:01.011
It's just no longer
under your control.

01:49:01.011 --> 01:49:03.130
(groaning)

01:49:03.130 --> 01:49:05.130
SAM: Sad trombone!

01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:06.686
(laughter)

01:49:06.686 --> 01:49:08.520
MATT: You're now going
to see the other side

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:09.678
of how this works.

01:49:09.678 --> 01:49:10.478
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:49:10.478 --> 01:49:12.253
MATT: Also, make a constitution
saving throw for me, please.

01:49:12.253 --> 01:49:13.755
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

01:49:13.755 --> 01:49:16.950
LAURA: But that's a devil that he's against, right?
And demons hate devils.

01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:18.963
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: 17, you resist the poison.

01:49:18.963 --> 01:49:22.798
The second strike
deals 15 points

01:49:22.798 --> 01:49:25.340
of slashing damage-- or piercing
damage, I'm sorry, piercing.

01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:27.799
And I need you to make a another
constitution saving throw.

01:49:27.799 --> 01:49:30.870
TRAVIS: Okay, first
radiant damage is--

01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:32.165
one point of radiant damage.

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:32.965
MATT: Nice!

01:49:32.965 --> 01:49:36.705
TRAVIS: Constitution
saving throw is a 10.

01:49:36.705 --> 01:49:38.760
MATT: A 10?
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.220
MATT: The poison pulses
through your body.

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:42.480
MARISHA: Fucking fuck.

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:44.052
MATT: You are poisoned.

01:49:44.052 --> 01:49:44.934
TRAVIS: Ah.

01:49:44.934 --> 01:49:46.240
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

01:49:48.968 --> 01:49:52.224
MATT: Be glad you
didn't roll one lower.

01:49:52.224 --> 01:49:54.490
SAM: What?
LAURA: Oh, that's right!

01:49:54.490 --> 01:49:56.350
SAM: What-- oh god!

01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:57.660
TRAVIS: What happens one lower?

01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:00.867
MATT: And with that, she's going to attempt 
to vanish into the ground.

01:50:00.898 --> 01:50:02.939
You do get one attack of
opportunity against her.

01:50:02.970 --> 01:50:05.102
MATT: With disadvantage,
because you're poisoned.

01:50:05.102 --> 01:50:07.245
TALIESIN: You can also use
a spell if you want to as

01:50:07.245 --> 01:50:08.370
your attack of opportunity.

01:50:08.370 --> 01:50:10.204
MATT: Because you're a
War Caster, you could.

01:50:10.204 --> 01:50:12.180
TALIESIN: So if
you have an attack

01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:14.840
spell that you like to use,
now is the time to use it.

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:17.850
TRAVIS: Not any that work
the way I want it to.

01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:18.722
MATT: Okay.

01:50:18.722 --> 01:50:20.950
TRAVIS: At disadvantage, right?
MATT: Yep.

01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:21.990
TRAVIS: It’ll miss.

01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:23.760
I think that's 15.

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.810
MATT: 15 misses.

01:50:24.810 --> 01:50:30.393
(whooshing) The other guy that's
currently controlled by Pumat's

01:50:30.393 --> 01:50:32.685
going to go ahead and attempt
to make an attack as well.

01:50:32.685 --> 01:50:33.580
TRAVIS: I'm hurt.

01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:34.510
MATT: And it hits.

01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:41.300
She takes five points
of piercing damage from the cultist.

01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:44.430
All righty, that
finishes her turn.

01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:45.840
Caduceus and the vrock are up.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.960
TALIESIN: Vrock first.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.480
MATT: Okay, vrock, take your turn.

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:50.512
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:50:50.512 --> 01:50:51.312
Sorry.

01:50:51.312 --> 01:50:56.690
SAM: When does vrock lose
its connection with Fjord?

01:50:56.690 --> 01:50:58.497
MARISHA: It did.
TRAVIS: Immediately?

01:50:58.521 --> 01:51:00.465
SAM: Is it after this turn?

01:51:00.465 --> 01:51:02.295
MATT: No, it's right now. It lost its turn.

01:51:02.315 --> 01:51:03.640
LIAM: So you're in control now?

01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.400
MATT: Technically.

01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:07.140
TRAVIS: It has multi-attack.

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:08.270
It has a bunch of shit.

01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:09.830
I can-- you got it.

01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:15.944
MATT: “On a successful save, your
Control of the demon ends

01:51:15.944 --> 01:51:18.076
and the demon spends its turns
pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons

01:51:18.076 --> 01:51:19.410
to the best of its ability.

01:51:19.410 --> 01:51:22.485
Technically, Obann's a fiend, so it's
not going to go after Obann.

01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:25.630
SAM: Wait, it's not going to--
a fiend is a demon?

01:51:25.630 --> 01:51:29.970
MATT: He's allied with an entity of the Abyss.
MARISHA: Fuck!

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:32.672
MATT: And he's a fiend.
LAURA: But he's a devil.

01:51:32.672 --> 01:51:35.270
MATT: He's not a devil. Not anymore.

01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:38.200
SAM: What? What do you mean, not any more?

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:40.580
TRAVIS: He made a
deal or something.

01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:42.120
LAURA: But he
looks like a devil.

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:47.493
MATT: Well, he has a devilish
heritage, but his alliance--

01:51:47.493 --> 01:51:48.660
SAM: No, you're right, Matt.

01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:50.680
MATT: No, no, no, I
think with the vrock

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.370
not having any knowledge
of Obann's current thing--

01:51:53.370 --> 01:51:56.450
no, he'd go after Obann. Yeah, let's go for it.

01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:59.448
Yeah, it's a good point.

01:51:59.448 --> 01:52:01.823
So since you have the stats up, if you want
to go ahead and roll for me?

01:52:01.851 --> 01:52:04.239
TRAVIS: Sure, would you like to do a multiattack?

01:52:04.239 --> 01:52:07.288
Would you like to Send Spores, or a Stunning Screech?

01:52:07.288 --> 01:52:08.580
MATT: Multiattack on it first.

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:09.580
TRAVIS: You got it, okay.

01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:14.202
First one is a beak attack,
which is a plus six to hit, so that's 21.

01:52:15.002 --> 01:52:15.961
LIAM: Peck, peck, peck.

01:52:15.961 --> 01:52:17.500
MATT: 21, that hits.

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.734
TRAVIS: Okay, 26 plus three.

01:52:19.734 --> 01:52:22.570
A seven, that's nine
points of piercing damage.

01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:23.590
MATT: All righty.

01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:26.240
TRAVIS: And the talon attack is
plus six to hit, which is an 11,

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:28.630
so it'll miss.
MATT: Misses.

01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:31.990
All right, so that's
the vrock's go.

01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:33.820
And it's going to
stay closest to him,

01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.403
and just stay engaged
going after him.

01:52:35.403 --> 01:52:36.091
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:52:36.091 --> 01:52:39.127
MATT: All right, that finishes its turn.
Caduceus, you're up.

01:52:39.127 --> 01:52:44.130
TALIESIN: I'm going
to turn invisible.

01:52:44.130 --> 01:52:45.167
MATT: Okay.

01:52:46.357 --> 01:52:47.251
TALIESIN: This is the first
thing I'm going to do,

01:52:47.251 --> 01:52:48.690
because this is a lot.

01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:50.650
MATT: Can you do it as
an action or a bonus?

01:52:50.650 --> 01:52:52.520
TALIESIN: That's a bonus action.
MATT: Nice!

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:55.285
TALIESIN: And also, I can cast
spells while I'm invisible.

01:52:55.285 --> 01:52:57.980
I can do a lot of stuff.

01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:01.130
I'm just trying to find that.

01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:03.600
MATT: It says you can
cast it while you’re invisible.

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.940
TALIESIN: Bonus action, turn
invisible until the start

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:05.970
of your next turn.

01:53:05.970 --> 01:53:07.970
You attack, deal damage
or force a saving throw.

01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:09.045
Yeah, yeah.

01:53:09.045 --> 01:53:11.676
MATT: Okay, so--

01:53:11.676 --> 01:53:14.790
MARISHA: This does look like a WarCraft raid.

01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:16.615
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

01:53:16.615 --> 01:53:18.406
MARISHA: All the nameplates
above all the characters.

01:53:18.406 --> 01:53:19.840
TALIESIN: Because I'm going
to bump the microphone

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:20.798
and make a weird sound.

01:53:20.798 --> 01:53:21.700
MATT: Do it.

01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:22.500
Do it!

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:29.680
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up
to get a little cover

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.540
from Obann, if I can.

01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:32.680
MATT: Back up here?

01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.595
TALIESIN: Yeah, and maybe like--

01:53:34.595 --> 01:53:35.620
MATT: There's not much to
get cover here unless you

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.662
want to go under the table.
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

01:53:37.662 --> 01:53:42.495
And I just want a clear shot
of Yasha, if I can see Yasha.

01:53:42.495 --> 01:53:45.420
MATT: She has half cover
from where you're standing right now

01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:49.240
TALIESIN: Okay, well, I'm
going to cast Dispel.

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:50.040
MATT: Okay.

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:52.165
TALIESIN: I know that
there's a little orange mark.

01:53:52.165 --> 01:53:54.215
MATT: Correct, you're
too far to see it.

01:53:54.215 --> 01:53:55.740
TALIESIN: Do I have
to see it to Dispel

01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:57.520
it if I know where it is?

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.740
MATT: If you do not--

01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:00.670
it's not an effect,
it's a focus.

01:54:00.670 --> 01:54:03.630
So I would say yes, you
would have to discern it.

01:54:03.630 --> 01:54:04.430
TALIESIN: Okay, so instead--

01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:05.750
MATT: You'd have to
get closer to do that.

01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:07.640
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going
to turn invisible, and move

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.970
towards until I can see it.

01:54:09.970 --> 01:54:11.576
MATT: Okay.

01:54:12.976 --> 01:54:14.380
30, you get right there.

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:15.230
You can see her.

01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:18.660
It's an action to
attempt to discern it.

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:20.170
It's not just a
casual look, this is

01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:22.238
you trying to make out a detail.

01:54:22.238 --> 01:54:24.550
Which means you can
attempt that next turn.

01:54:26.732 --> 01:54:27.941
But you have to see it first.

01:54:27.941 --> 01:54:30.380
TALIESIN: Oh!

01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.790
Okay.

01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:37.640
Can I be against the pillar
if I'm going to be doing this?

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.440
MATT: Sure.

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.368
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:54:40.368 --> 01:54:41.410
I just don't want to be--

01:54:41.410 --> 01:54:45.100
I want to make it as hard
as possible to get riled up.

01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.450
I will attempt to discern it.

01:54:46.450 --> 01:54:48.234
MATT: Roll a perception
check for me.

01:54:53.664 --> 01:54:54.464
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:57.000
11.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:57.880
MATT: 11?

01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:58.723
Okay.

01:54:58.723 --> 01:54:59.640
You had to beat at 10.

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:00.440
(gasping)

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:05.120
Make an active search from
looking at her from behind.

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:08.150
You glance in and peer as
she's attacking and moving,

01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:11.910
and you see that glimmer,
that flash of orange

01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:13.360
at the base of her neck.

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:15.740
And you now know
exactly where it is,

01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:18.760
and where the focus
can be attributed.

01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:22.040
That's your turn.

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.435
LAURA: Can you do a bonus?

01:55:23.435 --> 01:55:25.800
MATT: He did a bonus to turn invisible.
TALIESIN: My bonus is to turn invisible.

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:26.600
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.924
MATT: It's now the
Laughing Hand's turn.

01:55:27.924 --> 01:55:28.724
SAM: Oh shit.

01:55:28.724 --> 01:55:30.406
LAURA: That was awesome,
and smart, smart, smart.

01:55:30.406 --> 01:55:36.340
MATT: The Laughing Hand turns towards Beauregard, 
kicks the chair down the way.

01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:37.182
It falls over.

01:55:37.182 --> 01:55:38.391
LAURA: You can do this, Beau.

01:55:38.391 --> 01:55:42.290
MATT: Knocks the
actual altar itself.

01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:43.790
It (whooshing)
skids forward

01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:45.350
as he kicks it out of the way.

01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:47.050
And is going to
go ahead and make

01:55:47.050 --> 01:55:49.778
two melee attacks against you.

01:55:49.778 --> 01:55:50.920
MARISHA: With disadvantage.

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.450
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:58.720
First one is 21 to hit.

01:55:58.720 --> 01:55:59.760
MARISHA: (groaning)

01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:00.850
MATT: The right arm.

01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:02.200
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:04.025
MATT: And the second
one is a natural 20.

01:56:04.025 --> 01:56:04.980
LAURA: No!

01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.096
TALIESIN: Wait, wait,
with disadvantage?

01:56:07.096 --> 01:56:08.300
MATT: Oh no, so sorry.

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:10.660
It's natural 20 and
18, so the second one

01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:13.080
just hits, with a 29.

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:13.880
LAURA: Okay.

01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.380
Well, that's better
than a critical.

01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:17.047
MATT: Better than a critical.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:56:17.047 --> 01:56:19.770
MATT: Patient Defense
is your friend here.

01:56:19.770 --> 01:56:21.288
All right, so that
brings you to--

01:56:21.288 --> 01:56:24.293
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I guess it is, you're right.

01:56:24.293 --> 01:56:25.590
MATT: I'm trying to give
you the benefit here.

01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:26.590
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:56:26.590 --> 01:56:29.561
MATT: So as the blade
arcs and slams into you,

01:56:29.561 --> 01:56:31.270
you try and
parry out of the way.

01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:32.812
And as you feel cut
across your hand,

01:56:32.812 --> 01:56:35.347
the side of your chest and down
to your hip, and blood just

01:56:35.347 --> 01:56:36.931
(whooshing) scatters
across the stone.

01:56:36.931 --> 01:56:38.540
MARISHA: Bigger than I remember.

01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:43.550
MATT: You take 21 points
of slashing damage.

01:56:45.650 --> 01:56:48.070
And then it's going to slam
you with its other fist.

01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:51.810
It's going to (whooshing)
which it did hit critical.

01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:56.870
That is going to be 14
points of bludgeoning damage.

01:57:00.236 --> 01:57:02.610
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:04.565
SAM: It could be worse.

01:57:04.565 --> 01:57:05.800
MATT: All righty.

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:07.270
Top of the round.
Jester, you're up.

01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:08.010
LAURA: Okay.

01:57:08.010 --> 01:57:10.165
MATT: You watched them
all barrel through.

01:57:10.165 --> 01:57:11.533
You watched Beauregard
just get smacked

01:57:11.533 --> 01:57:12.696
around by the Laughing Hand.

01:57:12.696 --> 01:57:14.070
You watched the
Caedogeist appear

01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:16.314
and stab the fuck out of Fjord,
and Fjord's now doubling over.

01:57:16.314 --> 01:57:19.430
You see Yasha appearing
and striking at Nott.

01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:20.980
Caduceus vanishes.

01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:24.280
You can't even see
where Caleb is.

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:25.160
What are you doing?

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:27.451
MARISHA: It’s fucking chaos!

01:57:27.451 --> 01:57:30.070
LAURA: Are you
about to die, Fjord?

01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:32.370
Does he look like
he's about to die?

01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:34.580
SAM: Oh no!

01:57:36.328 --> 01:57:38.620
LAURA: What's more important,
trying to take down Obann

01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:40.550
or trying to heal?

01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:44.308
I don't think I can stay
ahead of all the damage,

01:57:44.308 --> 01:57:46.600
so it's going to be a matter
of getting people back up,

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:48.440
I think.

01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:54.440
TALIESIN: I ain’t gonna disagree.

01:57:55.590 --> 01:57:57.688
LAURA: I'm going to--

01:57:57.688 --> 01:57:59.129
TRAVIS: I have a question.
MATT: Yes?

01:57:59.129 --> 01:58:01.020
TRAVIS: If I'm poisoned, do
I take damage every round,

01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:02.870
or is it just disadvantage
on attack rolls?

01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:04.297
MATT: What you know
right now, it's just

01:58:04.297 --> 01:58:05.745
disadvantage on attack rolls.

01:58:05.745 --> 01:58:07.662
TRAVIS: What I know right now, okay.

01:58:07.662 --> 01:58:10.320
MATT: You can just feel it
like (whooshing)

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:13.450
through your veins.

01:58:13.450 --> 01:58:15.520
LAURA: It's not even
that much healing.

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.690
It's not that much healing!

01:58:16.690 --> 01:58:18.734
Even at the highest
level, it doesn't do shit.

01:58:18.734 --> 01:58:19.925
SAM: Do your thing.

01:58:19.925 --> 01:58:22.050
You don't heal, you attack.

01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:24.320
LAURA: It's not that I--
SAM: That's what you do.

01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:32.360
LAURA: I'm going to 4th-level 
Guiding Bolt Obann.

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.270
MATT: Okay, roll for attack.

01:58:35.090 --> 01:58:37.651
LAURA: Pew, pew!

01:58:41.151 --> 01:58:42.340
TRAVIS: I'm a paladin!

01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:43.550
MARISHA: A paladin!

01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:44.477
SAM: What's that mean?

01:58:44.477 --> 01:58:45.658
TRAVIS: I can do stuff.
LAURA: He can.

01:58:45.658 --> 01:58:46.949
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: That's good.

01:58:46.949 --> 01:58:47.907
TALIESIN: That's very good.

01:58:47.907 --> 01:58:49.986
LAURA: Because that
is a 34 to hit.

01:58:49.986 --> 01:58:51.590
No, no, 24.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:58:51.590 --> 01:58:52.390
(laughter)

01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:53.766
MATT: I was like, holy shit!

01:58:53.766 --> 01:58:55.250
TALIESIN: Still amazing.
LAURA: It's still good.

01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:57.000
MATT: Still amazing,
that definitely hits.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.870
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Physician, heal thyself.

01:58:58.870 --> 01:59:01.136
LAURA: That’s 7d6.

01:59:03.784 --> 01:59:05.740
Okay, 10--

01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:08.720
SAM: Caleb, you're
close to Obann, right?

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.875
Where are you?

01:59:09.875 --> 01:59:10.935
TALIESIN: Behind the machine.

01:59:10.935 --> 01:59:11.735
LAURA: 19.

01:59:11.735 --> 01:59:13.540
LIAM: Behind the door.

01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:15.450
LAURA: 22 points
of radiant damage.

01:59:15.450 --> 01:59:16.782
MATT: Oof, nice!

01:59:16.782 --> 01:59:18.445
LAURA: And he's glowing.

01:59:18.445 --> 01:59:19.725
MATT: So he gets blasted,

01:59:19.725 --> 01:59:21.325
like pushed back
three feet in the air.

01:59:21.325 --> 01:59:22.282
His wings have to correct

01:59:22.282 --> 01:59:23.688
as he floats
there for a second,

01:59:23.688 --> 01:59:26.020
the vrock still harrying him.
He looks down at you.

01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:27.322
LAURA: That's my duplicate.

01:59:27.322 --> 01:59:28.830
Pew, pew!
MATT: Yeah, at the duplicate.

01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:30.362
LAURA: And then my
bonus action, and I'm

01:59:30.362 --> 01:59:32.720
going to take my
Spiritual Weapon

01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:35.030
and try to clock the
one that's next to Fjord

01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:36.372
and try to get some of
those dudes off him.

01:59:36.372 --> 01:59:38.370
MATT: Go for it,
roll for an attack.

01:59:38.370 --> 01:59:39.650
LAURA: Whoa, wow, wow!

01:59:39.650 --> 01:59:41.116
That was aggressive.

01:59:41.116 --> 01:59:41.782
19.

01:59:41.782 --> 01:59:43.402
MATT: 19 hits, go
ahead and roll damage.

01:59:45.548 --> 01:59:46.661
LAURA: Eight points.

01:59:46.661 --> 01:59:47.870
MATT: Eight points of damage.

01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:50.270
He had taken a lot of damage
previously from attacking

01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:53.720
Fjord, and as it gets clobbered
into the ground, splats

01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:54.880
across the marble floor.

01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:56.078
LAURA: Okay.

01:59:56.898 --> 01:59:57.995
MATT: All right, you
want to move or stay put?

01:59:57.995 --> 01:59:59.060
LAURA: I'm staying put.

01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:00.080
MATT: Okay.

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:03.105
All right, that
brings us to Nott.

02:00:03.105 --> 02:00:05.522
You're up.

02:00:05.522 --> 02:00:11.775
SAM: I'm going to disengage by
tapping Yasha on one shoulder,

02:00:11.775 --> 02:00:13.400
and then running
around the other side.

02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:14.272
(laughter)

02:00:14.272 --> 02:00:16.020
MATT: Okay.

02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:17.532
All right, now
where are you going?

02:00:17.532 --> 02:00:20.210
SAM: Straight that
way until I get--

02:00:20.210 --> 02:00:22.210
MATT: As soon as you move
out of the way, Yasha,

02:00:22.210 --> 02:00:25.610
take your Sentinel attack,
because it ignores disengage.

02:00:25.610 --> 02:00:26.880
SAM: Oh shit!

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:28.000
(laughter)

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.696
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh no!

02:00:29.696 --> 02:00:30.860
ASHLEY: Do I still use reckless?

02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:32.682
MARISHA: (weakly) Sentinel babes!

02:00:32.682 --> 02:00:33.560
ASHLEY: That's okay.

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.570
MATT: You weren't
reckless last turn.

02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:36.960
ASHLEY: I was.

02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.936
MATT: Then how'd you
roll double ones?

02:00:38.936 --> 02:00:40.280
ASHLEY: Oh.

02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:41.930
MATT: That was the
first attack, then?

02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:43.105
Then there would have been 
a second attack

02:00:43.105 --> 02:00:44.730
That's okay, we can
roll that after this.

02:00:44.730 --> 02:00:45.660
SAM: Oh no!

02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:46.952
MATT: So if you were reckless--

02:00:46.952 --> 02:00:48.756
SAM: This turn got
real bad for me.

02:00:48.756 --> 02:00:50.090
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, really.

02:00:50.090 --> 02:00:51.370
ASHLEY: Yeah, I
did reckless, and I

02:00:51.370 --> 02:00:53.940
forgot my second attack, sorry.
MATT: No worries, it's all good.

02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:55.940
We'll come back and we'll
retroactively do that.

02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:56.740
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:00:56.740 --> 02:00:58.563
MATT: So for reckless, I
believe it's only on your turn,

02:00:58.563 --> 02:01:00.590
but I'll double check here.

02:01:00.590 --> 02:01:02.473
Reckless attack...

02:01:03.973 --> 02:01:05.358
SAM: The old tap on the
shoulder trick did not work.

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:06.887
MATT: Major weapon
attack rolls using

02:01:06.887 --> 02:01:07.687
strength during this turn.

02:01:07.687 --> 02:01:09.550
So yeah, you do not have
an advantage on this.

02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:10.660
So what'd you roll?

02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:12.690
ASHLEY: I rolled a 19,
but with the Skingorger,

02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:14.580
that is a critical hit.

02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:16.530
MATT: That is, yeah.

02:01:16.530 --> 02:01:18.595
So go ahead roll damage.

02:01:18.595 --> 02:01:21.510
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:23.110
I'm going to-- am I within 30?

02:01:23.110 --> 02:01:24.600
ASHLEY: Nah, let me do it.
MATT: Of her?

02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:25.726
Yeah.
(laughter)

02:01:25.726 --> 02:01:27.278
You are, yeah.

02:01:27.287 --> 02:01:29.270
So you go ahead and
you cancel the critical hit,

02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:30.667
so just roll regular damage.

02:01:30.667 --> 02:01:31.967
SAM: Is that a spell
that you just cast?

02:01:31.967 --> 02:01:32.757
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: It's an effect?

02:01:32.757 --> 02:01:33.840
TALIESIN: It's a reaction.

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:37.276
MATT: Whoo! You're lucky!

02:01:37.276 --> 02:01:39.440
SAM: But he doesn't pop out
from invisibility there?

02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:41.058
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine.
SAM: Great.

02:01:41.058 --> 02:01:43.040
ASHLEY: Oh, I rolled low.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:45.652
It's eight.

02:01:46.462 --> 02:01:48.075
MATT: That includes your
extra d6 for your first

02:01:48.075 --> 02:01:48.930
strike on the turn?

02:01:48.930 --> 02:01:49.730
ASHLEY: No.

02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:51.522
MATT: Don't forget that.

02:01:51.522 --> 02:01:52.900
ASHLEY: 11 points of damage.

02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:54.020
SAM: Okay.

02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:55.470
MATT: So take 11
points of damage.

02:01:56.635 --> 02:01:59.310
SAM: Okay, now I will
use my Uncanny Dodge

02:01:59.310 --> 02:02:01.080
to reduce that to five, right?

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.650
MATT: Yep, but your
speed is reduced to zero,

02:02:02.650 --> 02:02:05.160
so you are stuck there.

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:06.840
She hooks your foot, and you
fall on the ground

02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:09.020
and get back up, and
she's just on top of you.

02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:10.710
SAM: Damn it!

02:02:10.710 --> 02:02:17.363
Okay, I'm like on your left side
of Yasha right now, right?

02:02:18.233 --> 02:02:20.050
TALIESIN: Actually, you wouldn’t have
been able to even get that far

02:02:20.050 --> 02:02:22.230
would you, if you would still be--
MATT: Well, he moved around.

02:02:22.230 --> 02:02:23.010
TALIESIN: Oh, he moved around.

02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:24.820
MATT: And as soon he tried to
move out of her combat range

02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:27.403
TALIESIN: Because you
moved through, yeah.

02:02:27.403 --> 02:02:28.983
SAM: So attacks on
Obann still have

02:02:28.983 --> 02:02:30.900
advantage, because you hit--
MATT: Correct.

02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:33.070
LAURA: And he's
engaged with-- yeah.

02:02:33.070 --> 02:02:34.260
MATT: He's not
engaged with an ally,

02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:36.052
but the next attack
has advantage over you.

02:02:36.052 --> 02:02:38.400
SAM: It doesn't
have to be an ally.

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.080
He has to be engaged
with an enemy of him.

02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:42.225
MATT: Oh, okay, yeah.

02:02:42.225 --> 02:02:43.200
That's a valid point.

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:46.650
SAM: But either way, am
I more than 30 feet away?

02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:49.586
Because that imposes
disadvantage on my

02:02:50.466 --> 02:02:52.226
crossbow shot.

02:02:52.226 --> 02:02:53.940
MATT: But don't you
have the crossbow--

02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:54.962
SAM: I have--

02:02:54.962 --> 02:02:55.921
MATT: Oh, wait, no, no.

02:02:55.921 --> 02:02:56.721
SAM: No, I don't.

02:02:56.721 --> 02:02:58.020
MATT: That's the
sharpshooter, right?

02:02:58.020 --> 02:02:58.820
SAM: Yes.

02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:02.280
MATT: So yeah, he would
be just beyond 30 feet.

02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:03.780
SAM: So what does that mean?

02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:05.797
Do I get sneak attack or do not?

02:03:05.797 --> 02:03:06.912
MATT: Well, you do not get
advantage on the attack roll,

02:03:06.912 --> 02:03:08.440
but you do get sneak
attack if you damage

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.500
him because of the vrock.

02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:10.650
SAM: Okay, okay I'll take it.

02:03:10.650 --> 02:03:11.520
I'll shoot it.

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:12.840
MARISHA: Come on.

02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:13.770
SAM: Natural 20.

02:03:13.770 --> 02:03:16.320
(cheering)

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.300
(laughter)

02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:18.560
LAURA: (screaming) Yes!

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:20.121
Roll so high!

02:03:20.121 --> 02:03:21.444
TRAVIS: Whoa!
TALIESIN: Fuck!

02:03:21.444 --> 02:03:22.620
TRAVIS: Whoa!
TALIESIN: Fuck!

02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:24.427
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MARISHA: (yelling) Roll big!

02:03:24.427 --> 02:03:25.630
Roll big!
MATT: Okay.

02:03:25.630 --> 02:03:27.180
SAM: Not great, but average

02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:29.354
LAURA: It's average, it's average.
TALIESIN: With the sneak attack?

02:03:29.354 --> 02:03:30.958
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: It's average.

02:03:30.958 --> 02:03:31.783
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:31.783 --> 02:03:33.347
LIAM: The sneak attack
roll was average.

02:03:33.347 --> 02:03:34.680
MATT: Add all the dice together.

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:35.920
SAM: 18 on the dice.

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:36.720
MATT: All right.

02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:37.520
LAURA: Times two.

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:39.060
MATT: So 36 damage plus--

02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:41.190
SAM: Plus 6 is 42.

02:03:41.190 --> 02:03:44.470
I'll add Fury of the Small, 52.

02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:46.900
MATT: Ooh!

02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:47.900
Oh, that's not good!

02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:49.468
SAM: And shoots again.
TALIESIN: Shoots again.

02:03:49.468 --> 02:03:50.408
MATT: Go for it.

02:03:50.408 --> 02:03:52.165
Well no, you used your
bonus action to disengage.

02:03:52.165 --> 02:03:53.870
Oh no, it shoots again.
SAM: It shoots again.

02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:54.670
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:54.670 --> 02:03:56.072
SAM: 20 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

02:03:56.072 --> 02:03:58.028
Go ahead and roll damage.
That's exactly his armor class.

02:03:58.028 --> 02:03:59.820
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: 12 more points of damage!

02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:01.400
MATT: Nice!

02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:03.440
So as Obann's
like (flapping)

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:05.400
away from the vrock,
suddenly (whooshing) ah!

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:08.010
He tumbles five feet,
manages to pull back up,

02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:10.710
and gets shot
again, looks down at you,

02:04:10.710 --> 02:04:13.540
and is furious at both of you.

02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:14.060
Fuck!

02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:15.670
Okay, that's your turn.

02:04:15.690 --> 02:04:16.800
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.340
MATT: All right.

02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:19.920
He's looking hurt.

02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:20.860
Obann's looking hurt.

02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:22.110
SAM: That's good, that's good.

02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:24.110
MATT: That brings
us to Obann's turn.

02:04:24.110 --> 02:04:26.160
SAM: I'm a dead goblin.

02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:30.133
MATT: Obann is going to
pull away from the vrock,

02:04:30.133 --> 02:04:31.110
so he gets an attack
of opportunity.

02:04:31.110 --> 02:04:32.976
Go ahead and make one for me.

02:04:32.976 --> 02:04:34.310
TRAVIS: Oh, that's going to hit.

02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:35.570
That's a 19 plus something.

02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:37.320
MATT: Yeah that hits,
go ahead and damage.

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:41.960
TRAVIS: Let's do the
talon attack, so that's--

02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:44.560
TALIESIN: Did that
burn the advantage--

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.310
his attack?
MATT: No, the next attack.

02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:47.810
It kept it from
being disadvantaged.

02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:48.610
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:51.550
TRAVIS: 11 points
of slashing damage.

02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:52.926
MATT: Got it, okay.

02:04:52.926 --> 02:04:55.781
He takes half of that.

02:04:55.781 --> 02:04:58.240
TRAVIS: (whispering) That was
wrong this time, but it's okay.

02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.980
MATT: It's okay.

02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:01.210
All right.

02:05:01.210 --> 02:05:05.140
And he's going to swoop down the
stair, right into Nott's eyes.

02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:06.310
SAM: (wailing)

02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:10.490
MATT: And he'll say, "Oh, maybe you're
more useful than I thought."

02:05:10.490 --> 02:05:12.492
I need you to go ahead and
make a wisdom saving throw.

02:05:12.492 --> 02:05:13.610
MARISHA: Come on!
SAM: Wisdom not my thing.

02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:14.485
TRAVIS: Do it!
Do it!

02:05:14.485 --> 02:05:15.546
Counterspell it!

02:05:15.546 --> 02:05:17.100
LIAM: No, I'm not
going to do it.

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:18.400
SAM: 8.
MATT: 8?

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:19.353
LIAM: I also have to see.

02:05:19.353 --> 02:05:21.020
They're out of my sight.
MATT: You are--

02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:23.395
LAURA: I'm not going to do it--
MATT: --charmed by Obann.

02:05:23.395 --> 02:05:24.532
LIAM: I also have to have visual.

02:05:24.532 --> 02:05:25.491
LAURA: No, I know that.

02:05:25.491 --> 02:05:27.700
SAM: I'm charmed.

02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:35.550
MATT: And Obann says,
"This area grows dangerous.

02:05:35.550 --> 02:05:38.310
“Come with me, we have business."

02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:41.100
And he darts down and
through the doors,

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.698
closing them behind him.

02:05:43.238 --> 02:05:44.240
LIAM: Oh, and went
into the basement?

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:45.240
SAM: Wait!
MATT: Yes.

02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:46.521
SAM: Closed the doors-- how
can I follow him?

02:05:46.521 --> 02:05:48.498
He's really sending
mixed messages.

02:05:48.498 --> 02:05:49.722
(laughter)

02:05:50.162 --> 02:05:51.500
MARISHA: Follow me! (slam)

02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:53.130
SAM: Do I follow?

02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:54.520
MATT: When it comes--
it's not your turn.

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:55.320
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.290
MATT: But you're
currently charmed by him,

02:05:56.290 --> 02:05:57.570
and you consider
everybody else any enemy.

02:05:57.570 --> 02:05:59.080
SAM: Okay, great.

02:05:59.312 --> 02:06:00.330
MATT: All right.

02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:03.400
That brings us to Caleb's turn.

02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:04.500
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:07.950
So standing in the rain pouring
in through the broken window,

02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:10.170
the Cat's Claw looms
up over my head,

02:06:10.170 --> 02:06:11.710
and hopefully,
slashes the shit out

02:06:11.710 --> 02:06:12.960
of the cultist in front of me.

02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:13.860
MATT: Okay.

02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:16.670
LIAM: Oh, natural one!

02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:17.662
TRAVIS: Hey!

02:06:17.662 --> 02:06:20.253
MARISHA: Money!

02:06:21.158 --> 02:06:22.456
MATT: Sorry, Travis.

02:06:22.456 --> 02:06:23.635
MARISHA: OSD.

02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:28.950
LIAM: And I curse him in
Zemnian under my breath,

02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:30.382
and slap my hands together.

02:06:30.382 --> 02:06:34.170
(whooshing) And I cross
my fingers for good luck,

02:06:34.170 --> 02:06:38.440
and throw here.

02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:40.355
MATT: To get?

02:06:40.355 --> 02:06:41.730
LIAM: Because I
can see his head.

02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:43.846
I'm trying to get his head.

02:06:43.846 --> 02:06:44.930
MATT: Right, I understand.

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:45.983
LIAM: So I would use--

02:06:45.983 --> 02:06:47.400
MATT: Well, he's
on the outskirts.

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:48.571
If you hit him--

02:06:48.571 --> 02:06:49.530
LIAM: I would move it--

02:06:49.530 --> 02:06:50.572
MATT: --it's high enough.

02:06:50.572 --> 02:06:52.020
I could say say yes to hit him.

02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:53.520
Because he's so
tall and on the top,

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:56.535
you can probably hit him and
miss Yasha, if you want to,

02:06:56.535 --> 02:06:57.410
or you can hit Yasha.

02:06:57.410 --> 02:06:58.869
LIAM: I was not
worried about that.

02:06:58.869 --> 02:07:00.278
(laughter)

02:07:01.398 --> 02:07:02.323
ASHLEY: She's raging.

02:07:02.323 --> 02:07:04.250
TRAVIS: That's only
fire damage, though.

02:07:04.250 --> 02:07:06.127
LIAM: I was actually trying
to get as many of these people

02:07:06.127 --> 02:07:06.960
as I could without--

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:08.169
MATT: Oh, like here you mean?

02:07:08.169 --> 02:07:11.071
LIAM: --hitting myself and
while hitting him.

02:07:11.071 --> 02:07:13.529
MATT: To hit the guy near you,
it'll also hit Nott and him,

02:07:13.529 --> 02:07:14.940
so you'll have to hit
everything but the guy

02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:16.370
who's up next to you.

02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:18.383
LIAM: I don't know
where Nott is.

02:07:18.383 --> 02:07:19.325
MATT: Nott is right there.
LIAM: No, I know where Nott is.

02:07:19.325 --> 02:07:20.950
MATT: No, you mean
you don't know that.

02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:22.189
So if you're doing
this, then yeah,

02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:24.150
it'll go after Nott as well.

02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:25.495
SAM: It's okay. I'm an enemy.

02:07:26.035 --> 02:07:27.370
LAURA: That's true.
LIAM: Yeah, I'm doing it.

02:07:27.370 --> 02:07:28.620
LAURA: It might knock you out.

02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:30.162
MATT: So it hits
both Yasha and Nott.

02:07:30.162 --> 02:07:32.060
SAM: I just used my reaction.

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:33.102
Oh, but this is--
MATT: This is evasion.

02:07:33.102 --> 02:07:34.758
LIAM: It's evasion, man.
SAM: Yeah.

02:07:35.218 --> 02:07:36.169
MATT: So go ahead
and roll your damage.

02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:37.711
LIAM: That's why to
going to have a--

02:07:40.230 --> 02:07:41.350
18, 20--

02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:43.160
SAM: This is a complicated fight.
TRAVIS: That was fucking awesome.

02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.900
MATT: It is.
LIAM: 30 points of fire damage.

02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:46.192
MATT: 30 points of fire damage.

02:07:46.192 --> 02:07:47.210
Laughing Hand rolls--

02:07:47.210 --> 02:07:49.120
oh, almost a 19!

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.028
Nine, failure.

02:07:51.028 --> 02:07:53.070
But he gets half of that,
because he's resistant.

02:07:53.070 --> 02:07:54.154
No, he's lost resistances.

02:07:54.154 --> 02:07:55.520
That's right, so it's 30.

02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.610
30 to the Laughing Hand!

02:07:57.610 --> 02:08:00.420
He's taking hits.

02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:02.571
All right, so against--

02:08:02.571 --> 02:08:05.350
ASHLEY: 30 points
of fire damage?

02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:06.403
SAM: Are you raging?

02:08:06.403 --> 02:08:07.320
Does that do anything?

02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:09.562
MATT: Even if both
these guys succeed

02:08:09.562 --> 02:08:12.573
they explode
and burn out of the way.

02:08:12.573 --> 02:08:14.344
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's
got physical damage.

02:08:15.590 --> 02:08:17.158
MATT: Roll another wisdom
saving throw, please.

02:08:17.158 --> 02:08:18.310
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Actually, on the defense.

02:08:18.310 --> 02:08:19.310
LIAM: For defense, yeah.

02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:22.740
MATT: That guy next to you--

02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:28.075
he rolls a 16 plus one, 17.

02:08:28.075 --> 02:08:29.860
LIAM: (singing) Ah, oh, oh!

02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:30.660
He saves.

02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:31.460
MATT: Okay, yeah.

02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:32.770
LIAM: That's DC 17.

02:08:32.770 --> 02:08:35.380
SAM: (singing) Ah, ah, oh!

02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:43.110
MATT: But he's already
taken a hit, though, right?

02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:44.880
LIAM: I don't remember.

02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:45.830
I think he ran over.

02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:47.395
He was a Spiritual Weapon guy.

02:08:47.735 --> 02:08:49.170
MATT: The Spiritual
Weapon guy was destroyed.

02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:51.328
He went over, so you
have not hit him yet, yes.

02:08:51.328 --> 02:08:53.003
LIAM: I don't think I have.

02:08:53.593 --> 02:08:55.040
TALIESIN: I feel like
he got hit by something.

02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:56.283
I feel like everybody's
been hit by something.

02:08:56.283 --> 02:08:57.470
LAURA: I don't know
SAM: Caduceus!

02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:58.590
TALIESIN: Maybe not.

02:08:58.590 --> 02:09:00.830
LAURA: He might have been
hit by the last fireball,

02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:02.001
but he didn't go down.

02:09:02.001 --> 02:09:03.168
LIAM: He was over
here, but he ran from--

02:09:03.168 --> 02:09:04.987
MATT: He rushed over here,
and then ran over here,

02:09:04.987 --> 02:09:06.580
and then dashed up to catch him.

02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.820
LAURA: I don't know.

02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:10.870
MATT: I’ll say for the terms of it, sure

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:15.003
MATT: He's probably taken
a hit, and that damage

02:09:15.003 --> 02:09:16.670
he took from this was
almost all his hit

02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:18.190
points based on
what he had anyway,

02:09:18.190 --> 02:09:20.595
so he is disintegrated
from that.

02:09:20.595 --> 02:09:21.915
And then--

02:09:21.915 --> 02:09:23.796
LIAM: He was having
a bad day anyway.

02:09:23.796 --> 02:09:27.110
MATT: Yasha and Nott, you
guys can roll dexterity saving

02:09:27.110 --> 02:09:28.290
throws, please.

02:09:28.290 --> 02:09:30.270
Yasha, you do not
see its source,

02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:31.935
so you do not have
advantage on this.

02:09:31.935 --> 02:09:33.685
LIAM: Now I'll make
my wisdom saving roll.

02:09:33.685 --> 02:09:35.697
SAM: This is not for
the fire that I'm saving

02:09:35.697 --> 02:09:37.280
against right now, right?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:37.865
MATT: Hm?

02:09:37.865 --> 02:09:39.240
SAM: I'm saving
against the fire?

02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:40.040
MATT: Yes.

02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:40.840
SAM: Oh, 21.

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:42.100
MATT: 21?

02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:42.900
Yasha?

02:09:45.342 --> 02:09:48.920
ASHLEY: That would be 21.

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:49.780
MATT: 21.

02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:51.495
15 points of fire
damage to each of you.

02:09:51.495 --> 02:09:52.340
You take none, though.
SAM: So I take none.

02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:53.715
MATT: Because you
have evasion.

02:09:53.715 --> 02:09:55.534
SAM: So I take none, so I'm
going to add it back in.

02:09:55.534 --> 02:09:58.043
TRAVIS: Do you roll
against the Dominate spell?

02:09:58.043 --> 02:09:59.550
TALIESIN: On your turn.
LAURA: When you're hit?

02:09:59.550 --> 02:10:00.420
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:01.574
TRAVIS: I thought
it was each time you

02:10:01.574 --> 02:10:03.680
got hit by-- I might be wrong.
MATT: This isn't a spell.

02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:04.480
This is an ability.

02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:05.420
TRAVIS: Ooh!

02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:08.690
MATT: And even then, he
didn't take any damage.

02:10:08.690 --> 02:10:10.160
Because of his evasion.

02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:12.455
All right, are you
going to move, stay put?

02:10:12.455 --> 02:10:13.400
LIAM: Oh, me?

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:14.540
And that guy is gone?

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:16.070
I'm going to come
out this way past

02:10:16.070 --> 02:10:21.250
the Hand over by that window
so I can get eyes on the field, yeah.

02:10:21.801 --> 02:10:24.153
And I push over--
LAURA: Is this your first time seeing everything?

02:10:24.153 --> 02:10:24.953
LIAM: --full view.

02:10:24.953 --> 02:10:26.950
TRAVIS: (booming)
You guys okay?

02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:28.720
(laughter)

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:31.020
LIAM: You guys are just
seeing fireworks go off.

02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:33.044
TRAVIS: (wailing)

02:10:33.044 --> 02:10:35.358
Like the weasel
around Jester's neck.

02:10:35.358 --> 02:10:36.294
(falsetto) Help!

02:10:37.094 --> 02:10:39.830
MATT: Caleb is done.

02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:42.110
This one cultist
that remains here

02:10:42.110 --> 02:10:48.650
is going to go ahead and attack
the other two in there, with

02:10:48.650 --> 02:10:51.110
two-- yeah, one of them hits.

02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:55.220
It's going to do
five points to him.

02:10:58.210 --> 02:11:00.590
That one's looking hurt.

02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:02.710
Also, these two doors--

02:11:02.710 --> 02:11:03.630
LAURA: God!

02:11:03.630 --> 02:11:06.260
SAM: Oh yeah, those guys.

02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:07.907
Cool, those doors really open.

02:11:07.907 --> 02:11:08.991
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

02:11:08.991 --> 02:11:15.230
SAM: That’s a weird design, though.

02:11:15.230 --> 02:11:16.030
(laughter)

02:11:16.030 --> 02:11:17.430
MATT: And more of these
cultists coming through.

02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:20.066
MARISHA: Well, we should put
them on different hinges.

02:11:20.866 --> 02:11:22.240
MATT: 30.

02:11:24.170 --> 02:11:25.480
SAM: Weird building codes.

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:28.120
LAURA: The cultists are like,
"Ah! I thought these were push!"

02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:30.370
LIAM: One's an entrance only,
and one's an exit only.

02:11:30.370 --> 02:11:34.134
MATT: That's going to
rush up to pincer Pumat.

02:11:34.134 --> 02:11:35.622
TRAVIS: (yelling) Not Pumat!

02:11:35.622 --> 02:11:36.697
MATT: All righty.

02:11:36.697 --> 02:11:37.906
TRAVIS: They got gold cloaks!

02:11:37.906 --> 02:11:40.530
SAM: Save Pumat at all costs.

02:11:40.530 --> 02:11:41.800
MATT: Beauregard?

02:11:42.455 --> 02:11:46.920
Oh, you also have one
guy attacking you over there.

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:49.120
Two attacks against you.

02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:51.530
MARISHA: Disadvantage? I still have Patient
Defense up.

02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:53.365
MATT: Which is good, because that first one
would have been a critical.

02:11:53.365 --> 02:11:55.032
So instead, that brings it to 15.

02:11:55.032 --> 02:11:55.925
MARISHA: Miss.

02:11:55.925 --> 02:11:57.040
MATT: And miss.

02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:58.410
They both miss.
That was a nine.

02:11:58.410 --> 02:11:59.557
MARISHA: Jeez Louise!

02:12:00.191 --> 02:12:02.513
MATT: Now it's your turn, Beauregard.
TALIESIN: Patient Defense is great.

02:12:02.513 --> 02:12:03.804
MARISHA: I love it.

02:12:03.804 --> 02:12:06.000
Oh, okay.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.970
I'm just slip
the guy behind me,

02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:10.430
and as I am dodging him--

02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:13.280
as I slip, and I'm
going to come around,

02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:16.700
crack uppercut to the Laughing
Hand with my lightning fists,

02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:19.625
and then I'm going to slip
again and go for his kidney.

02:12:19.625 --> 02:12:21.365
MATT: Sure.
MARISHA: That's something.

02:12:21.389 --> 02:12:22.309
Or his mouth?

02:12:22.309 --> 02:12:23.690
LIAM: Your hands going
right in the mouth.

02:12:23.690 --> 02:12:24.490
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:12:24.490 --> 02:12:27.330
LAURA: Ew! Oh god.

02:12:27.330 --> 02:12:31.060
MARISHA: Okay, pop,
pop, two attacks.

02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:32.150
22 and 27.

02:12:32.150 --> 02:12:33.388
MATT: Ooh, both hit.

02:12:33.388 --> 02:12:34.430
Go ahead and roll damage.

02:12:37.112 --> 02:12:38.290
MARISHA: Balls.

02:12:38.290 --> 02:12:39.090
Crap.

02:12:39.090 --> 02:12:43.970
12 plus five, so 17 damage.

02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:44.900
MATT: Nice.

02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:46.953
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

02:12:46.953 --> 02:12:48.930
Stunning Strike
on that first one.

02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:56.400
MATT: 14.

02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:57.200
MARISHA: Miss.

02:12:57.200 --> 02:12:58.399
Or save-- (sputtering).

02:12:58.399 --> 02:13:00.274
(yelling) It works is
what I'm trying to say!

02:13:01.074 --> 02:13:03.726
MATT: That was a ride there
in like half a second.

02:13:03.994 --> 02:13:05.262
MARISHA: My save is 15.

02:13:05.262 --> 02:13:07.667
TRAVIS: That was in
the park, home run.

02:13:07.667 --> 02:13:08.802
And he's first,
second, third, home.

02:13:08.802 --> 02:13:11.732
MATT: Laughing Hand is stunned.
MARISHA: He's stunned.

02:13:11.882 --> 02:13:13.910
MATT: Oh, that first hit!

02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:15.797
(gurgling) And you
punch, it's weird.

02:13:15.797 --> 02:13:18.381
You fought him previously, and
it was like hitting solid rock.

02:13:18.381 --> 02:13:20.990
As you punch, it has give
to it, and your hand almost

02:13:20.990 --> 02:13:24.940
feels stuck, almost like the flesh is turned to
a thick, rubbery molasses.

02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.250
And as you
pull your hand out--

02:13:27.250 --> 02:13:30.478
whatever you guys did to him, or whatever
you did to the Perma-Heart,

02:13:30.478 --> 02:13:33.060
definitely fucked him up in some ways.

02:13:33.096 --> 02:13:34.430
TALIESIN: Mercy killing, really.

02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:36.645
MARISHA: (singing)
Flurry of Blows.

02:13:36.645 --> 02:13:37.705
MATT: All right.

02:13:37.705 --> 02:13:41.090
MARISHA: (singing) Doing
it again with advantage.

02:13:41.090 --> 02:13:43.770
First pop, 22.

02:13:43.770 --> 02:13:45.130
MATT: 22 hits.

02:13:45.130 --> 02:13:48.375
MARISHA: Second pop.

02:13:48.375 --> 02:13:49.175
TRAVIS: Oh!

02:13:49.175 --> 02:13:53.030
MARISHA: What if you roll a
natural one, but it's at a--

02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:54.360
no, no.

02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:55.160
17?

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.240
MATT: 17 does not hit.

02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:58.610
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:13:58.610 --> 02:14:02.195
So one-- another nine damage.

02:14:02.195 --> 02:14:03.590
MATT: Another nine damage.

02:14:03.590 --> 02:14:07.562
(impacts)
You see the eyes go lolling a bit.

02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:09.020
He's looking hurt.

02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:10.520
MARISHA: (singing)
And he's stunned.

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:11.360
MATT: Yes, he is.

02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:12.735
MARISHA: (singing)
For one round.

02:14:12.735 --> 02:14:15.420
MATT: All right, that
brings us to Yasha.

02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:17.180
ASHLEY: Okay, question.
MATT: Yes?

02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:21.290
ASHLEY: Am I able to attack
Nott if she is on our side now?

02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:24.140
MATT: Nott you know is on your
side, so no, Nott is a friend.

02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:28.130
You're used to Obann
taking other people's

02:14:28.130 --> 02:14:29.120
wills for his own.

02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:34.490
So now the closest enemy to
you is Beauregard or Caleb.

02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:35.748
Both within your reach.

02:14:35.748 --> 02:14:37.790
TALIESIN: It doesn't see--
oh, it does see Caleb.

02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:40.005
MATT: Caleb moved into
her vision, so yeah.

02:14:40.005 --> 02:14:45.350
ASHLEY: Okay, so I see Beauregard,
and I am going to slowly

02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:46.610
start walking towards her.

02:14:46.610 --> 02:14:47.672
MATT: Okay.

02:14:47.672 --> 02:14:51.682
You move up the steps,
holding the blade.

02:14:51.682 --> 02:14:52.730
(heavy footsteps)

02:14:53.530 --> 02:14:57.170
MATT: You see Yasha arrive
up above the top

02:14:57.170 --> 02:14:59.150
of the stairs, Skingorger at her side.

02:14:59.150 --> 02:15:01.433
MARISHA: Long time no see.

02:15:01.433 --> 02:15:02.600
ASHLEY: Raging and reckless.

02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:03.400
MATT: Okay.

02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:11.025
ASHLEY: It's cocked.
Ooh, that's a 19.

02:15:11.025 --> 02:15:12.555
SAM: That's a crit.

02:15:15.110 --> 02:15:17.424
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:15:17.424 --> 02:15:18.613
MATT: It was a natural 19?

02:15:18.613 --> 02:15:19.780
ASHLEY: It was a natural 19.

02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:20.780
MATT: Yeah, it's a crit with Skingorger.

02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:23.746
LAURA: Are you Patient Defensing?

02:15:23.746 --> 02:15:24.580
TALIESIN: Nope.

02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:27.253
MARISHA: I Flurry of Blows'd.

02:15:27.253 --> 02:15:28.700
LIAM: Nailed it.

02:15:29.605 --> 02:15:34.385
ASHLEY: Okay, and Divine
Fury, so that's--

02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.543
SAM: Oh boy, guys!

02:15:38.406 --> 02:15:40.683
It feels like this fight's
been going on for two hours.

02:15:40.683 --> 02:15:41.975
LAURA: It has.
MARISHA: It has.

02:15:41.975 --> 02:15:43.340
MATT: It has been.
Well, almost.

02:15:43.385 --> 02:15:44.735
SAM: That's why it feels like it.

02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:49.120
ASHLEY: That would be 15.

02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:49.920
MATT: 15 damage?

02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:51.820
ASHLEY: That was the
damage, and then that's--

02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:53.403
MATT: That's with
the extra d6, right?

02:15:53.403 --> 02:15:54.815
ASHLEY: That's
with the extra d6.

02:15:54.815 --> 02:15:56.190
MATT: Doubling
the dice, and then

02:15:56.190 --> 02:15:57.357
adding your attack modifier.

02:15:57.357 --> 02:15:58.892
ASHLEY: Well, doubling,
that would be--

02:15:58.892 --> 02:16:00.870
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh no!
MATT: You double the dice.

02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:02.370
ASHLEY: Double the dice?
MATT: Yeah.

02:16:02.370 --> 02:16:03.745
ASHLEY: Yes, so
that would be 20.

02:16:03.745 --> 02:16:04.740
MATT: So 20?

02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:07.053
You take 20 points
of damage total.

02:16:07.053 --> 02:16:08.180
MARISHA: What was the--
ASHLEY: I am so sorry.

02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:10.097
MARISHA: --number you just said?
TALIESIN: 20.

02:16:10.097 --> 02:16:10.897
ASHLEY: 25.

02:16:10.897 --> 02:16:12.883
MATT: 25 points of damage
from Yasha's first strike.

02:16:12.883 --> 02:16:13.683
ASHLEY: 25.
(groaning)

02:16:13.683 --> 02:16:15.183
MATT: You're out?
MARISHA: I'm out.

02:16:15.183 --> 02:16:16.141
MATT: Beauregard falls.

02:16:16.141 --> 02:16:17.530
ASHLEY: Sorry, 27.

02:16:18.424 --> 02:16:20.858
SAM: There's a lot of
math going on over there.

02:16:21.826 --> 02:16:23.740
ASHLEY: Sorry, 55.

02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:25.021
(laughter)

02:16:25.021 --> 02:16:26.670
ASHLEY: Just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

02:16:26.670 --> 02:16:27.470
She's out?

02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:33.767
MATT: You guys watch as
Beauregard suddenly falls

02:16:33.767 --> 02:16:34.851
down with a blow of Yasha.

02:16:34.851 --> 02:16:37.921
(whooshing) Make
your second attack?

02:16:37.921 --> 02:16:39.364
ASHLEY: Fuck.

02:16:39.364 --> 02:16:40.807
SAM: Oh boy.

02:16:43.693 --> 02:16:47.760
MATT: With advantage because
of reckless.

02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:50.680
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:53.512
MARISHA: I'll instantly take
two death save fails, right?

02:16:53.512 --> 02:16:55.304
MATT: If she hits you, yeah.
ASHLEY: Fuck.

02:16:55.304 --> 02:16:56.888
LAURA: Are you going
to hit her again?

02:16:56.888 --> 02:16:58.049
ASHLEY: It's 21.

02:16:58.049 --> 02:17:00.260
MATT: So you fail
two death saves.

02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:01.510
Yasha cuts Beau down.

02:17:01.510 --> 02:17:02.310
She falls to the ground.

02:17:02.310 --> 02:17:05.310
And you watch her step up and
take the Skingorger and just-- (impact)

02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:06.500
(gasping)

02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:08.314
It evokes imagery
you've seen once before.

02:17:08.314 --> 02:17:09.746
ASHLEY: (whispering) Oh, fuck!

02:17:09.746 --> 02:17:10.829
SAM: Oh no!

02:17:10.829 --> 02:17:13.485
MARISHA: Molly!

02:17:13.485 --> 02:17:14.690
SAM: Oh nos!

02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:17.642
TRAVIS: Oh, I just got the worst chills.

02:17:17.642 --> 02:17:21.874
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

02:17:21.874 --> 02:17:23.220
MATT: That's your turn, right?

02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:24.020
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:27.282
(stammering)

02:17:27.282 --> 02:17:29.820
TALIESIN: Do you want to move?

02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:30.620
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:32.594
LAURA: (whispering) I don’t know who’s in between.
There are so many extra things.

02:17:32.594 --> 02:17:34.400
MATT: You still have more
movement if you want to.

02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:36.233
LAURA: (whispering) How
low are you, though?

02:17:36.233 --> 02:17:38.150
MATT: You used 15 movement
feet to get to her,

02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:40.909
so you can move
another 20 if you want.

02:17:40.909 --> 02:17:46.370
ASHLEY: Yeah, I start having
tears roll down my face,

02:17:46.370 --> 02:17:49.079
and I slowly turn around, and I
start walking down the stairs.

02:17:49.079 --> 02:17:49.879
MATT: Towards?

02:17:49.879 --> 02:17:52.860
ASHLEY: Towards Fjord.

02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:54.692
TRAVIS: Fuck.

02:17:54.692 --> 02:17:57.549
MATT: Yasha comes towards
you, blade at the side,

02:17:57.549 --> 02:17:59.037
tears down her face.

02:17:59.345 --> 02:18:01.103
All right, that finishes your turn, Yasha.

02:18:01.103 --> 02:18:01.936
Fjord, it's your go.

02:18:01.936 --> 02:18:03.624
SAM: Welcome back, Ashley!

02:18:03.624 --> 02:18:05.120
MARISHA: Two death saves.

02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:06.360
Two death fails.

02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:08.570
TRAVIS: That totally changes
what I was going to do.

02:18:08.570 --> 02:18:10.760
LIAM: Next roll’s real important.
MARISHA: Next roll’s really important.

02:18:11.646 --> 02:18:12.879
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:18:12.879 --> 02:18:14.600
So she's standing
between me and Beau?

02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:16.429
MATT: Yeah.

02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:18.219
TRAVIS: All right, on the fly.

02:18:18.219 --> 02:18:19.219
On the fly, on the fly.

02:18:20.019 --> 02:18:23.000
LAURA: (singing) Orphan Maker!

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Making some orphans!

02:18:25.149 --> 02:18:26.489
SAM: (singing) Making all those orphans!

02:18:26.979 --> 02:18:30.469
TALIESIN: We've got a long
time before your turn comes.

02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:31.719
MARISHA: Is it very long time?

02:18:31.719 --> 02:18:32.553
LIAM: Six seconds.

02:18:32.553 --> 02:18:35.650
MARISHA: But a lot of things
can happen, like other things

02:18:35.650 --> 02:18:36.760
attacking me in that time.

02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:41.097
MATT: At least you went (laughs)
before Yasha and not after.

02:18:41.097 --> 02:18:42.746
TRAVIS: All right.

02:18:42.746 --> 02:18:45.400
I'm going to look at
Yasha walking towards me.

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:48.219
I'm going to hold my
hand out and say: Tell me

02:18:48.219 --> 02:18:52.165
you can hear me, and I will
cast Enervation at Yasha.

02:18:52.165 --> 02:18:53.540
MARISHA: What is that?

02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:54.370
SAM: What?

02:18:54.370 --> 02:18:56.350
I've never heard that word in my life.

02:18:56.350 --> 02:18:57.465
Enervation?

02:18:57.465 --> 02:18:58.870
LAURA: What is Enervation?

02:18:58.870 --> 02:19:01.720
TRAVIS: It is "a tendril
of inky darkness

02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:03.270
"reaches out from you, touching

02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:07.080
"a creature you can see within
range to drain life from it.

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:09.715
"It must make a dex
saving throw of 17."

02:19:09.715 --> 02:19:13.700
MATT: All right, go ahead
and make a dex saving throw.

02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:14.500
You do have ad--

02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:18.090
ASHLEY: Would I have advantage even
if I don't know what it is?

02:19:18.090 --> 02:19:19.590
TRAVIS: There is a
barbarian thing--

02:19:19.590 --> 02:19:20.969
ASHLEY: I love how I’m
arguing against--

02:19:20.969 --> 02:19:22.000
LAURA: You're raging?

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.705
TRAVIS: It's not a rage thing.

02:19:23.705 --> 02:19:26.230
ASHLEY: Dex on effects that
you can see while not blinded.

02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:28.882
MATT: Well, you can see, so
yes, you have advantage on it.

02:19:28.882 --> 02:19:32.370
ASHLEY: So that would be a 14.

02:19:32.370 --> 02:19:34.066
First's one good.

02:19:34.066 --> 02:19:36.260
And 14 both, too.

02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:37.413
MATT: So that's a fail, right?

02:19:37.413 --> 02:19:38.719
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: You can roll your damage.

02:19:38.719 --> 02:19:40.219
TRAVIS: All right.
SAM: So she's dead?

02:19:40.219 --> 02:19:41.019
LAURA: No.

02:19:41.019 --> 02:19:41.900
SAM: You killed her?

02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.640
MATT: She takes 4d8
necrotic damage.

02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:45.276
LAURA: Whoa!

02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:52.760
TRAVIS: So you take 21
points of necrotic damage,

02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:57.420
and I take 11 points of healing.

02:19:57.420 --> 02:19:58.596
SAM: Oh!

02:19:58.596 --> 02:20:00.161
LAURA: That's pretty
tits right there.

02:20:00.161 --> 02:20:00.888
MARISHA: Awesome!

02:20:00.888 --> 02:20:02.471
MATT: So you watch
as Fjord does this.

02:20:02.471 --> 02:20:04.500
Reach out and grasps
his fingers, suddenly

02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:07.320
the shadows bite
into you like teeth,

02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:09.270
and the pain strikes
through your body,

02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:12.630
and as the blood pulls
out, it (whooshing)

02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:14.008
all shoots towards
Fjord, and you

02:20:14.008 --> 02:20:15.300
watch his wounds begin to seal.

02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:16.830
But the shadows stick to you.

02:20:16.830 --> 02:20:18.130
The spell continues.

02:20:18.130 --> 02:20:22.490
ASHLEY: There's the
slightest look of relief.

02:20:24.736 --> 02:20:26.492
MATT: Fjord, is that your turn?

02:20:26.492 --> 02:20:28.310
TRAVIS: That guy is
still behind me, right?

02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:29.110
MATT: Yeah.

02:20:29.110 --> 02:20:30.710
TRAVIS: And Yasha’s within melee range now?
MATT: Yeah.

02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:31.920
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm
not going anywhere.

02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:33.590
MATT: All right. Pumat's turn.

02:20:33.630 --> 02:20:36.790
Pumat's now being flanked
by two guys, and is like,

02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:41.940
"All right, this
is problematic. (grunts)"

02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:45.490
And he's going to go ahead
and begin to cast a spell.

02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:48.570
As he reaches back behind,
there's a shortsword

02:20:48.570 --> 02:20:49.650
in a sheath behind him.

02:20:49.650 --> 02:20:52.455
And as he pulls it
out, he begins casting,

02:20:52.455 --> 02:20:53.580
muttering under his breath.

02:20:53.580 --> 02:20:58.320
And you watch as suddenly, his
body begins to swell in size.

02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:03.080
You watch his muscles (bursting).
He grows about three feet taller.

02:21:03.091 --> 02:21:04.800
TALIESIN: Oh, I've
been hoping to say it.

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:05.645
Keep going.

02:21:05.645 --> 02:21:08.720
MATT: And his robe pulls, Hulk-style,

02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:10.380
at the edges of his body.

02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:12.990
His shortsword now
suddenly emits this

02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:14.735
force energy around it.

02:21:14.735 --> 02:21:17.150
(whooshing) And
Pumat is now Hulked

02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:18.450
out between the two of them.

02:21:18.450 --> 02:21:19.950
TALIESIN: Do we want
to say it together?

02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:21.090
Three, two, one.

02:21:21.090 --> 02:21:22.440
LIAM, ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Pumat Swole!

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:23.428
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:21:23.428 --> 02:21:25.358
(laughter)

02:21:25.358 --> 02:21:27.150
TALIESIN: Been sitting
on that for so long,

02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:28.730
hoping there'd be a reason.

02:21:28.730 --> 02:21:30.900
MATT: He gains 50
temporary hit points.

02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:32.485
TRAVIS: Oh, what
the fuck is this?

02:21:32.485 --> 02:21:34.235
MATT: It is a spell
called Transformation.

02:21:34.235 --> 02:21:36.065
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:21:36.065 --> 02:21:37.430
TRAVIS: Whoa!

02:21:37.430 --> 02:21:42.020
MATT: He's going to swing
towards the cultist to his left

02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:42.950
with the shortsword.

02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:44.626
TRAVIS: 50!

02:21:44.626 --> 02:21:46.830
LIAM: He's straight
up Andre the Giant.

02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:49.590
(awwing)

02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:51.670
MATT: 15, that hits.

02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:57.080
So he's going to
deal six plus two--

02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:04.160
eight points of slashing damage,
plus 15 points of force damage,

02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:09.140
and just (whooshing) scatters
that cultist to one side.

02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:12.664
Spins to swing
against the other one.

02:22:16.860 --> 02:22:17.860
14 misses the other one.

02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:20.550
(whooshing) But
you see Pumat just

02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:21.883
completely disintegrate
one of them with a blow,

02:22:21.883 --> 02:22:24.766
and the other when-- he swings
wide, he goes (screaming)

02:22:24.766 --> 02:22:26.558
and freaks out, and
just turns toward them.

02:22:26.558 --> 02:22:29.696
(crashing) "Don't
worry, I got this."

02:22:29.696 --> 02:22:32.672
(laughter)

02:22:35.152 --> 02:22:38.980
He's going to move here and spin

02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:41.440
to turn his way in that
direction of the battle.

02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:43.540
That finishes his turn.

02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:47.870
It is now-- just
turn two of them.

02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:49.705
This one here is going
to go ahead and swing.

02:22:49.705 --> 02:22:50.895
Actually, seeing
Pumat like that,

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:52.602
he's going to rush
over and strike him

02:22:52.602 --> 02:22:53.810
now that he's the big threat.

02:22:53.810 --> 02:22:55.768
And the other one's going
to attack you, Fjord.

02:22:57.640 --> 02:22:59.560
MATT: With advantage,
because he’s behind you.

02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:01.300
That's cocked on that one.

02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:03.010
That's an eight, misses.

02:23:03.010 --> 02:23:05.380
Second attack, 20.

02:23:05.380 --> 02:23:06.180
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:07.450
MATT: All right.

02:23:07.450 --> 02:23:11.426
You take six points
of piercing damage.

02:23:11.426 --> 02:23:13.510
TRAVIS: He will take six
points of radiant damage.

02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:15.316
MATT: And that will destroy him.

02:23:15.316 --> 02:23:17.620
(exploding)

02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:19.590
It just scatters
off as he strikes

02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:21.280
you from behind,
the sword pulsing

02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:24.225
with each time you take damage.

02:23:24.225 --> 02:23:26.225
And the one that's going
to be attacking Pumat--

02:23:28.830 --> 02:23:32.230
Nope, he misses with
the first attack,

02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:34.120
and hits with the second one.

02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:41.800
Pumat takes eight points
of damage from that.

02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:44.125
All righty, it is now--

02:23:55.940 --> 02:23:57.190
SAM: Oh shit!

02:23:57.190 --> 02:24:00.032
TRAVIS: I totally fucking forgot-
MARISHA: Oh fuck, forgot about this bitch.

02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.870
TALIESIN: I didn't.

02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:02.725
TRAVIS: She just came up
right up in your grill.

02:24:02.725 --> 02:24:04.435
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:24:04.435 --> 02:24:06.170
MATT: And there it will end.

02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:09.042
What's your passive
perception, by the way?

02:24:09.042 --> 02:24:10.425
LAURA: Passive perception?

02:24:10.425 --> 02:24:11.995
15.

02:24:12.025 --> 02:24:14.190
MATT: Yeah, you do not even notice
until she's right upon you.

02:24:14.190 --> 02:24:14.990
LAURA: (screaming)

02:24:14.990 --> 02:24:16.907
MATT: Like you're looking at
this, and suddenly it's

02:24:16.907 --> 02:24:18.199
like (whooshing)
right into your face,

02:24:18.199 --> 02:24:19.858
and she stabs you right in the
gut, or attempts to, at least.

02:24:19.858 --> 02:24:21.650
MARISHA: Clever girl.
SAM: Block that shit.

02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:22.830
Block that shit.

02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:26.020
MATT: That's going
to be 24 to hit.

02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:28.625
TALIESIN: Jesus H. Fucking Christ!

02:24:28.625 --> 02:24:32.339
MATT: You suffer--

02:24:33.185 --> 02:24:35.775
TALIESIN: It's two of these is all it takes.

02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:41.635
ASHLEY: I'm stressing.

02:24:41.635 --> 02:24:43.812
SAM: It's not looking
good for our heroes, guys.

02:24:43.812 --> 02:24:46.020
MARISHA: No, it's really not.
We got to do something.

02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:47.520
SAM: We got
one down and dying.

02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:49.340
MATT: 42 points of
piercing damage.

02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:51.880
I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:54.480
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:24:54.649 --> 02:24:56.210
TALIESIN: Working on it.

02:24:56.210 --> 02:25:00.716
LAURA: 17 plus three, a 20?

02:25:00.716 --> 02:25:01.692
MATT: 20?

02:25:01.692 --> 02:25:02.734
TALIESIN: Not this round.

02:25:02.734 --> 02:25:03.790
MATT: Okay, no worries.

02:25:03.790 --> 02:25:06.765
And the second attack against
you does not have advantage.

02:25:06.765 --> 02:25:08.932
TALIESIN: I can do
some other shit that's rad.

02:25:08.932 --> 02:25:10.616
MATT: 18.

02:25:10.616 --> 02:25:13.856
LAURA: Oh, it hits my brand
new shield and gets blocked!

02:25:13.856 --> 02:25:16.390
MATT: You deflect the second blow.

02:25:17.382 --> 02:25:18.870
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:24.996
MATT: And then she is going to 
vanish back into the floor.

02:25:25.985 --> 02:25:27.532
LAURA: Do I get an attack
of opportunity on her?

02:25:27.532 --> 02:25:28.960
TALIESIN: If you want it, yeah.

02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:31.200
LAURA: Okay, yeah, with my axe.
TALIESIN: Unless you were planning on using a reaction.

02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:31.840
LAURA: Oh.

02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:33.715
No, I don't really do
anything with reaction.

02:25:33.715 --> 02:25:35.330
MATT: Do you have War Caster?

02:25:35.330 --> 02:25:36.520
LAURA: No!
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:39.400
LAURA: Ah! Whoa. That's--

02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:41.030
SAM: What is that?

02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:43.340
LAURA: I don't know, that's cocked.
SAM: What is is dice?

02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:45.632
LAURA: It's awesome is what
it is, if I can tell what--

02:25:45.632 --> 02:25:50.770
14 plus eight, so 22.

02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:52.640
MATT: 22?

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:54.880
That hits, go ahead
and roll damage.

02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:56.296
LAURA: Cool!

02:25:56.296 --> 02:25:59.240
SAM: Extract Aspects!

02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:01.990
LAURA: Seven points
of slashing damage.

02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:04.939
MATT: As you strike her, she
vanishes back into the floor.

02:26:05.215 --> 02:26:06.465
Disappears out of sight.

02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:14.000
All right, that
finishes her turn.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.260
Caduceus and the vrock.

02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:20.170
With Obann gone, the vrock's
nearest enemy...

02:26:20.170 --> 02:26:21.775
It's going to be Yasha.

02:26:21.775 --> 02:26:23.221
ALL: Oh!

02:26:25.495 --> 02:26:27.120
MARISHA: Oh!
SAM: Yeah!

02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:27.950
MATT: Swoops down.

02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:29.949
Go ahead and make the
attacks against Yasha.

02:26:29.979 --> 02:26:31.958
You have advantage, because she'd
used reckless strikes.

02:26:31.958 --> 02:26:35.240
TRAVIS: Oh jesus! Okay, you want the talon
and the bite attack?

02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:36.040
MATT: Yeah.

02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:38.250
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:26:38.250 --> 02:26:40.003
TALIESIN: How do we
get rid of this thing?

02:26:40.003 --> 02:26:40.803
SAM: (laughs) How
do we get rid of it?

02:26:40.803 --> 02:26:42.920
LAURA: We have to fight it. 
MARISHA: And kill it.

02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:45.170
TRAVIS: With advantage,
that's only a 15 to hit.

02:26:45.170 --> 02:26:46.050
MATT: Armor class is?

02:26:46.050 --> 02:26:46.850
ASHLEY: 17.

02:26:46.850 --> 02:26:48.130
MATT: 17.

02:26:48.130 --> 02:26:49.880
By the way, you guys
will notice now Yasha

02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:51.990
is wearing a new breastplate.

02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:55.305
It has these curled tusk-type
horns that come off the front

02:26:55.305 --> 02:26:57.050
and curve over the shoulders.

02:26:57.050 --> 02:26:58.650
SAM: Whoa!
LAURA: Oh shit!

02:26:58.650 --> 02:27:00.590
MARISHA: That's badass.

02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:02.200
SAM: Whoa!
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:03.160
17?
MARISHA: It's cool.

02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:04.840
MATT: Just hits.
ASHLEY: 17 just hits.

02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:05.915
MATT: Go ahead and
roll damage on that.

02:27:05.915 --> 02:27:07.760
It's half damage, though,
because of your rage.

02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:09.080
ASHLEY: Yep.

02:27:11.536 --> 02:27:13.180
TRAVIS: 10, so five.

02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:14.920
MATT: Five points.

02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:17.610
All right. Caduceus?

02:27:17.610 --> 02:27:20.180
TALIESIN: I become visible.

02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:22.851
MATT: The vrock is right there.

02:27:22.851 --> 02:27:24.310
TALIESIN: Does the
vrock notice me?

02:27:24.310 --> 02:27:26.477
LAURA: Vrock is very surprised.
MATT: As you appear?

02:27:26.477 --> 02:27:28.900
I mean, it's focused
on attacking Yasha,

02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:30.480
but you’re in melee with it.

02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:31.950
TALIESIN: I am
in melee with it.

02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:32.820
That's irritating.
LIAM: (clucking)

02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:34.292
TRAVIS: You know that
vrocks sound like chickens.

02:27:34.292 --> 02:27:36.250
SAM: You could move away
and then do it.

02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:37.440
TALIESIN: No, I can't.

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:39.800
I turned visible at
the start of my turn.

02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:41.700
SAM: Oh, because yours
is some weird ability.

02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:42.853
TALIESIN: Some weird ability.

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:44.520
So first thing I'm going to do

02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:47.910
is I'm going to cast
Dispel at level five

02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:49.882
at the back of Yasha's neck.

02:27:49.882 --> 02:27:51.567
MATT: 5th-level?
TALIESIN: 5th-level.

02:27:51.567 --> 02:27:53.450
MARISHA: Come on. Come on!

02:27:53.450 --> 02:27:54.357
MATT: That works.

02:27:54.357 --> 02:27:58.592
(cheering)

02:27:58.650 --> 02:28:03.380
MATT: So as you appear, and you turn,
the vrock harrowing Yasha,

02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:05.555
she spins around, blade ready.

02:28:05.555 --> 02:28:08.090
You see Beauregard over
there bleeding to death

02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:09.860
on the top of the altar.

02:28:09.860 --> 02:28:12.800
Fjord is sitting there,
desperately backing up.

02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:16.940
As you focus and concentrate,
the light around the cathedral

02:28:16.940 --> 02:28:25.040
fades, and darkness of the clouds above
(distant thunder) take the space.

02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:27.590
As you open your
hand and concentrate,

02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:30.470
and feel the Wildmother's
energy course through you,

02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:33.890
the Dispel Magic
emanates from her neck,

02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:35.790
and you watch the
symbol burn bright

02:28:35.790 --> 02:28:37.250
and then shatter.

02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:41.330
As it does, lightning strikes the outside.

02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:44.035
All of the stained
glass windows shatter

02:28:44.035 --> 02:28:47.045
at once, raining down into the
center of the cathedral.

02:28:47.045 --> 02:28:48.545
SAM: Oh wow!

02:28:48.545 --> 02:28:51.010
MATT: Yasha grabs
the back of her neck.

02:28:51.010 --> 02:28:54.630
And for the first time in
as long as you can remember,

02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:56.455
Obann's out of your head.

02:28:56.455 --> 02:28:58.970
ASHLEY: I let out
a primal scream

02:28:58.970 --> 02:29:01.970
of agony and relief
and everything,

02:29:01.970 --> 02:29:03.440
and just fall on my knees.

02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:09.992
LAURA: (sobbing)
ASHLEY: (gasping)

02:29:09.992 --> 02:29:11.165
MATT: That's your action.

02:29:11.165 --> 02:29:12.440
TALIESIN: That's my action.

02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:14.650
For my bonus action--

02:29:14.650 --> 02:29:16.670
as I have done my prayer
and my little thing,

02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:20.720
I'm just going to turn,
and a little beetle

02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:27.440
is going to run up and
tap Beau on the ankle,

02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:29.960
and Spare the Dying.

02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:31.100
It's going to be cast.

02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:32.267
MATT: So you are stabilized.

02:29:32.267 --> 02:29:34.230
SAM: Woo-hoo-hoo!

02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:35.250
MATT: Grave Clerics, yo!

02:29:35.250 --> 02:29:36.750
SAM: Oh, Caduceus!

02:29:36.750 --> 02:29:40.330
ASHLEY: If I came back,
and you fucking died at the table,

02:29:40.330 --> 02:29:42.860
I’d be like, I'm going
to see myself out.

02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:44.540
TALIESIN: Seeing
what's happened,

02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:47.590
I'm going to make sure
that I'm standing next to Yasha.

02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:48.460
MATT: You are.

02:29:48.460 --> 02:29:52.260
TALIESIN: So I'm just going
to keep my back to the wall.

02:29:52.260 --> 02:29:54.975
Not going to move.

02:29:54.975 --> 02:29:56.150
MATT: All right.

02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:59.752
TALIESIN: I'm just going to
say: We got it back.

02:30:00.092 --> 02:30:01.594
That's my turn.

02:30:01.594 --> 02:30:03.180
MATT: Finishing Caduceus' turn.
Yasha?

02:30:03.180 --> 02:30:05.030
MARISHA: Stabilize means zero?

02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:07.630
TALIESIN: You are at
three successes.

02:30:07.630 --> 02:30:13.040
MATT: You’re not up, you’re just no longer making death saves.

02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:14.280
TALIESIN: You are at zero.

02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:17.930
MATT: Obann washes away, and
you hear the crackle of thunder

02:30:17.930 --> 02:30:19.956
echoing through the city.

02:30:19.956 --> 02:30:22.307
And you feel the surge
of strength fill you,

02:30:22.307 --> 02:30:24.141
as the entity that's
been trying desperately

02:30:24.141 --> 02:30:27.801
to help you break through is
definitely now at your side.

02:30:27.801 --> 02:30:29.510
You close your eyes
and remember yourself

02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:32.195
fighting against the chains
and the dreams that were given.

02:30:32.195 --> 02:30:33.860
And as you close
your eyes, you see

02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:36.260
yourself breaking the shackles.

02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:38.180
You see the influence
no longer holding

02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:40.670
any sway over your soul.

02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:45.411
There's nothing but the
storm, vengeance, and hope.

02:30:45.411 --> 02:30:47.370
LIAM: Heavy metal music plays.

02:30:47.370 --> 02:30:49.410
MATT: It's the
Laughing Hand's turn.

02:30:49.410 --> 02:30:50.975
He is stunned.

02:30:52.338 --> 02:30:54.130
Does nothing, because
he's fucking stunned.

02:30:54.130 --> 02:30:55.561
SAM: Damn!

02:30:55.561 --> 02:30:57.223
MARISHA: (singing) Rock harpist!

02:30:57.223 --> 02:30:58.890
MATT: Until the end
of Beau's next turn.

02:30:58.890 --> 02:31:00.662
Jester, you're up.

02:31:00.662 --> 02:31:01.985
ASHLEY: (whispering) Oh my god.

02:31:01.985 --> 02:31:04.480
LAURA: Okay.

02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:08.870
I'm going to have my duplicate

02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:12.130
run up to Beau on the ground.

02:31:12.130 --> 02:31:14.010
TALIESIN: Oh yeah,
do a touch heal.

02:31:14.010 --> 02:31:16.350
LAURA: Yeah, she's going
to kneel down and put both

02:31:16.350 --> 02:31:18.510
her hands on on the
side of Beau's face

02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:28.220
and cast as Cure
Wounds at 4th-level.

02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:29.520
MATT: At 4th-level?

02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:30.320
LAURA: Yeah.

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:31.156
MATT: Okay.

02:31:31.156 --> 02:31:34.204
LAURA: It's 4d8.

02:31:34.204 --> 02:31:36.140
TALIESIN: Welcome fucking back.

02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:37.200
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah!

02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:38.961
MARISHA: Oh, welcome back.

02:31:38.961 --> 02:31:41.296
TALIESIN: Ah!

02:31:41.296 --> 02:31:44.245
Ah, fuck some shit up!

02:31:44.245 --> 02:31:45.175
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

02:31:45.175 --> 02:31:47.035
TALIESIN: Ah fuck.

02:31:47.035 --> 02:31:50.725
LAURA: 11, 16, 22!

02:31:50.725 --> 02:31:52.880
Plus five!

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:53.680
27!

02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:55.700
MATT: 27 points of healing to you, Beauregard.

02:31:56.520 --> 02:31:57.940
That's great.

02:31:59.590 --> 02:32:02.092
MARISHA: (groaning) Whoa,
mouth tastes like blood.

02:32:02.092 --> 02:32:04.250
(gurgling) Wait, what?

02:32:05.050 --> 02:32:06.967
MATT: You look up, and
the first thing you see

02:32:06.967 --> 02:32:11.310
is Laughing Hand overhead,
going (wheezing and slow cackling).

02:32:11.310 --> 02:32:14.080
And you're like,
oh, shit shit, shit!

02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:16.330
LAURA: Well, the first thing
you see is my duplicate--

02:32:16.330 --> 02:32:17.130
MATT: That's true.

02:32:17.130 --> 02:32:17.941
LAURA: -- waving.

02:32:17.941 --> 02:32:19.570
TRAVIS: Hi!

02:32:19.570 --> 02:32:22.493
MATT: You are covered in
shattered stained glass, by the way.

02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:25.020
MARISHA: (groaning)
Thanks, Jester.

02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:27.310
SAM: Jes dupe.

02:32:27.310 --> 02:32:28.580
MARISHA: Jes dupe.

02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:31.979
MATT: Jester, does that finish your turn?
Are you going to move?

02:32:32.486 --> 02:32:36.508
TRAVIS: Is there rain pouring
in through the open windows now?

02:32:36.508 --> 02:32:37.716
MATT: It's starting to, yeah.

02:32:37.716 --> 02:32:43.170
LAURA: I'm going to run over-- oh god.

02:32:43.870 --> 02:32:47.150
There's nowhere to hide
from this stupid chick.

02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:51.180
But I'm going to come and try
to get over here if I can.

02:32:52.610 --> 02:32:55.840
MATT: 25, 30, that's as
far as you can move. You got it.

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:56.700
LAURA: Thanks.

02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:58.356
MATT: Nott?

02:32:58.356 --> 02:33:01.450
SAM: Beauregard is prone.

02:33:01.450 --> 02:33:02.670
MATT: Correct.

02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:05.605
SAM: That imposes
disadvantage on my attack.

02:33:05.605 --> 02:33:08.622
MATT: Correct, but
Obann said to follow.

02:33:08.622 --> 02:33:12.330
SAM: Yes, but I want to
bust off a shot before I go.

02:33:12.330 --> 02:33:13.180
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:33:13.180 --> 02:33:15.752
SAM: But she's at disadvantage.

02:33:15.752 --> 02:33:18.760
MATT: Disadvantage on a strike
against Beauregard, go for it.

02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:20.860
SAM: So I don't
get sneak attack?

02:33:20.860 --> 02:33:22.410
MATT: You do not.

02:33:22.410 --> 02:33:28.290
SAM: And I'm too far from anyone
who I would have advantage on.

02:33:28.290 --> 02:33:29.530
MATT: Correct.

02:33:29.530 --> 02:33:31.670
Because they've got Yasha back.

02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:35.546
SAM: So there's no clear
favorite to who I would shoot.

02:33:35.546 --> 02:33:38.490
MATT: Pumat, technically, but you have
disadvantage from that distance.

02:33:38.510 --> 02:33:40.600
SAM: Yeah, that's disadvantage also.
ASHLEY: I'm also not on your side anymore.

02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:42.391
MATT: But he has allies
next to him, so you would.

02:33:42.391 --> 02:33:45.560
LAURA: Oh, that's true, Yasha.
ASHLEY: I'm not friends with--

02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:47.685
SAM: So I would fire with
disadvantage on the shot,

02:33:47.685 --> 02:33:50.695
but I would still get
sneak attack if I hit?

02:33:50.695 --> 02:33:52.405
MATT: Against Pumat,
you would, yes.

02:33:52.445 --> 02:33:53.835
SAM: Oh, and against Beauregard.

02:33:53.835 --> 02:33:54.960
MATT: Against Beauregard, yeah.

02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.585
LAURA: Do you know
that's my duplicate,

02:33:56.585 --> 02:33:58.176
or do you think
that might be me?

02:33:58.176 --> 02:33:59.140
SAM: I don't know.

02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:00.760
That's a good question.

02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:01.751
I don't know.

02:34:01.751 --> 02:34:03.460
I don't know what I
saw earlier, and if I

02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:04.498
retained that information.

02:34:04.498 --> 02:34:05.950
I assume I'd retain
that information.

02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:07.400
LAURA: Yeah, but you
don't know which one is me

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:09.547
and which one's the duplicate.
SAM: That's true.

02:34:09.547 --> 02:34:10.630
Should I roll to find out?

02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:12.430
MATT: Who would
you want to attack?

02:34:12.430 --> 02:34:15.490
SAM: I would want to attack
the person who I would get most

02:34:15.490 --> 02:34:17.950
damage on, which would be
Jester's duplicate, if I

02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:20.770
think it's Jester.

02:34:20.770 --> 02:34:22.363
MATT: Roll an
intelligence check.

02:34:22.363 --> 02:34:24.405
You can roll d20, add your
intelligence modifier.

02:34:24.405 --> 02:34:25.810
If you roll a 10 or higher--

02:34:25.810 --> 02:34:26.840
SAM: Natural one.

02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:28.910
MARISHA: 500 bucks! OSD!

02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:31.590
MATT: So yeah, you
think that's Jester.

02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:32.850
(laughter)

02:34:32.850 --> 02:34:34.240
SAM: So I will attack Jester.

02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:36.796
MATT: Okay, roll for the attack.

02:34:36.796 --> 02:34:39.285
SAM: Oh, it's terrible, anyway. 12.

02:34:39.285 --> 02:34:40.337
MATT: It passes through.

02:34:40.337 --> 02:34:42.771
MARISHA: Jes Dupe, look out! Oh.

02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:44.860
Don’t-- it's fine.

02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:48.830
SAM: Then I'll say:
Come, Hand, let's leave!

02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:50.080
And I will go down the stairs.

02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:52.720
MATT: Nott vanishes
through the door.

02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:54.843
LAURA: (screeching) Come, come!
SAM: Come, Hand!

02:34:55.366 --> 02:34:56.230
MATT: All right.

02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:59.466
LAURA: Oh no, now
we've lost Nott.

02:34:59.466 --> 02:35:01.910
MATT: That finishes Nott's go.

02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:02.710
Caleb, you're up.

02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:04.840
LIAM: Caleb, totally
rain-soaked and numb,

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:06.880
just starts walking
in, having seen

02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:09.730
Beauregard, his good
friend, get stabbed through.

02:35:09.730 --> 02:35:13.630
Pulled up, walks directly
behind the Laughing Hand,

02:35:13.630 --> 02:35:16.870
pulls out the Cat's Cradle,
slams it into the ground.

02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:19.570
And I cast Widogast's
Web of Fire,

02:35:19.570 --> 02:35:21.400
and concentrate it
on the Laughing Hand.

02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:25.120
I'm actually standing
in front of the column.

02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:27.340
So that can jump
five feet or climb

02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:30.110
five feet, so it should be able
to go up and slam into his ass.

02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.910
MATT: Yep.

02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:32.409
LIAM: 5th-level.

02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:37.340
So that will be 11d6.

02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:38.140
SAM: 11d6.

02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:40.237
MARISHA: Do you have to roll to hit?

02:35:40.237 --> 02:35:41.654
LIAM: No.
MARISHA: Fucking dope. Fucking not.

02:35:41.654 --> 02:35:43.770
LIAM: Oh, dex save for him.

02:35:43.770 --> 02:35:45.530
LAURA: But he's stunned.
LIAM: Stunned.

02:35:45.570 --> 02:35:48.250
MATT: He's stunned,
which means he automatically

02:35:48.250 --> 02:35:50.920
fails dexterity saving throws.

02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:55.000
LAURA: Look at all those red dice.

02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:00.820
LIAM: 40--
MARISHA: Kill it.

02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:02.520
LIAM: 46 points of fire damage.

02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:03.320
TRAVIS: Ooh!

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:04.404
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:36:04.404 --> 02:36:06.320
(cheering)

02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:09.243
LIAM: So Cat's Cradle hits
the ground, ring of fireballs.

02:36:09.243 --> 02:36:14.780
(hissing) And all of the
motes of fire stretch out

02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:18.860
and converge into one
thick five-foot wide wall,

02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:22.130
and like a tsunami of fire,
just goes (whooshing).

02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:25.280
Jumps up the steps,
climbs up his back,

02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:28.270
and burns his entire backside.

02:36:28.270 --> 02:36:32.970
MATT: As the flames engulf him,
the fire is a bonfire. The heat is immense.

02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:35.410
And Beauregard, you have to
wince and pull away a bit,

02:36:35.410 --> 02:36:37.170
it’s burning so hot.

02:36:37.170 --> 02:36:39.890
He just stands
there, not reacting,

02:36:39.890 --> 02:36:43.040
the flames just engulfing,
and the laughter gets louder.

02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:44.330
And louder.

02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:45.710
And louder.

02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:47.190
Then thinner.

02:36:47.190 --> 02:36:48.032
Then thinner.

02:36:48.032 --> 02:36:49.638
(whispering) Then thinner.

02:36:49.638 --> 02:36:51.305
And then the flames
eventually burn out,

02:36:51.305 --> 02:36:54.500
and he's still just standing,
A blackened body on its feet.

02:36:54.500 --> 02:36:56.246
LAURA: Oh, sick!

02:36:56.246 --> 02:36:57.530
TRAVIS: Wow!

02:36:57.530 --> 02:37:01.391
LIAM: Get the fuck away from my friends.

02:37:01.391 --> 02:37:04.026
TRAVIS: Wo-o-ow! (laughs)

02:37:04.026 --> 02:37:05.770
SAM: (yelling) Hand, you coming?

02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:08.244
(laughter)

02:37:08.244 --> 02:37:10.172
Should I wait, or should I--

02:37:10.172 --> 02:37:13.550
I'm just going to go.

02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:14.555
MATT: All right.

02:37:14.555 --> 02:37:16.490
The cultist over there
is going to go ahead

02:37:16.490 --> 02:37:19.850
and take its strikes at Pumat.

02:37:19.850 --> 02:37:21.330
TRAVIS: Pumat Swole?

02:37:21.330 --> 02:37:23.170
MATT: Pumat Swole.

02:37:23.170 --> 02:37:24.504
One hit.

02:37:24.504 --> 02:37:28.003
Pumat takes six points
of slashing damage.

02:37:28.003 --> 02:37:30.170
They're all just
grazing off of him

02:37:30.170 --> 02:37:32.960
from the temporary hit points.

02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:38.300
And you watch as two more begin
to rush from around the corners here.

02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:39.276
MARISHA: What the fuck!

02:37:39.276 --> 02:37:42.160
MATT: They get this close with their full
movement to get in there.

02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:44.695
And you hear skittering noises
coming from up inside there.

02:37:44.695 --> 02:37:46.002
LAURA: Come on!

02:37:46.002 --> 02:37:50.090
LIAM: A rainbow Volkswagen pulls up,
and 20 guys come running out.

02:37:50.864 --> 02:37:52.515
MARISHA: Some monster
spawner somewhere.

02:37:52.515 --> 02:37:53.890
MATT: Beauregard,
it's your turn.

02:37:53.890 --> 02:37:56.780
MARISHA: It's my turn? Oh, it's my turn!
Ah.

02:37:59.876 --> 02:38:02.300
I'm going to stand up.

02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:04.750
MATT: Pumat also maintains
concentration on the--

02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:05.764
TRAVIS: What's that?

02:38:05.764 --> 02:38:08.420
MARISHA: Are we going to
try and make a run for it?

02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:15.295
What should we do?

02:38:15.295 --> 02:38:17.130
MATT: You still have
a vrock, by the way,

02:38:17.130 --> 02:38:18.660
that’s been
summoned, and is just

02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:20.360
fighting whatever is nearby.

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:23.980
LIAM: Oh, I didn't use my bonus
action for my kitty claw.

02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:25.580
MATT: That's true. What do you want
to do with that?

02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:26.880
LIAM: Can I send it over
to hit the vrock, please?

02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:27.680
MATT: Sure.

02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:31.228
ASHLEY: It’s time to vrock? What was it?
TALIESIN: Vrock and roll.

02:38:31.350 --> 02:38:34.175
TRAVIS: Whatever it was,
it didn't vrock so much.

02:38:34.175 --> 02:38:35.330
MATT: (laughs) Nope.

02:38:35.330 --> 02:38:36.920
LIAM: Rolled a 12.

02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:40.720
MATT: What’s the armor class of the vrock?

02:38:43.854 --> 02:38:45.296
TRAVIS: Sorry. 15.

02:38:45.296 --> 02:38:46.190
MATT: 15?

02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:48.160
Yeah, misses, so
the claws just miss.

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:49.905
The vrock dodges out of the way.

02:38:49.905 --> 02:38:53.265
TALIESIN: There's
two people coming.

02:38:53.265 --> 02:38:54.780
LIAM: We got a
lady in the floor.

02:38:57.372 --> 02:38:59.055
MATT: All right.

02:38:59.055 --> 02:39:00.555
MARISHA: Did I see
Nott go downstairs?

02:39:00.555 --> 02:39:02.275
MATT: Nope.
MARISHA: No? Okay.

02:39:02.290 --> 02:39:03.832
MATT: You just come
to consciousness,

02:39:03.832 --> 02:39:07.860
and you pull back, watching the 
Laughing Hand just burn into a cinder.

02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:10.830
You wake up, you look up
and see Jester's form,

02:39:10.830 --> 02:39:13.320
and you see Yasha over
there on her knees,

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:14.670
holding the Skingorger.

02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:18.000
You're covered in stained
glass that's broken.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.030
Caleb walks around the
way, and just

02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:22.420
looking intensely in his eyes.

02:39:22.420 --> 02:39:24.420
Fjord is still like (groaning).

02:39:24.420 --> 02:39:26.753
The poison's still
coursing through his body.

02:39:26.753 --> 02:39:28.670
And Caduceus is on the
other side of the vrock

02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:30.150
who's now
thrashing around.

02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:32.700
MARISHA: I want to-- still in shock,

02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:36.400
but on autopilot, get
up, wipe my mouth,

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:39.150
and just stumble
as I stagger over

02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:44.070
to this demon, on
autopilot, and shake my head,

02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:46.695
and jump back in the fight.

02:39:46.695 --> 02:39:48.986
MATT: Go for it.

02:39:48.986 --> 02:39:53.620
MARISHA: I'm holding my
rib that's still fucked up.

02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:55.710
Oh, jeez Louise.

02:39:55.710 --> 02:39:57.906
16 and a 16.

02:39:57.906 --> 02:39:59.790
MATT: 16 and 16?

02:39:59.790 --> 02:40:01.435
The vrock's AC is 15?
TRAVIS: 15.

02:40:01.465 --> 02:40:03.590
MARISHA: No, no, no,
I wanted this guy.

02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:06.330
MATT: Oh, him! Sorry, I missed that.

02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:08.930
All right, go for it.
MARISHA: 16 and 16.

02:40:08.930 --> 02:40:10.340
MATT: Both hit.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:11.860
MATT: Roll damage.

02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:16.975
MARISHA: 22 total damage.

02:40:16.975 --> 02:40:20.640
MATT: Yeah, he is just splatted.

02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:24.010
MARISHA: And just like for
one more for good measure,

02:40:24.010 --> 02:40:25.530
curb stomp him.

02:40:25.530 --> 02:40:27.240
Because I'm so fucked up.

02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:28.510
MATT: Yep.

02:40:28.510 --> 02:40:32.205
MARISHA: And I look up at
Pumat, and I'm just like--

02:40:32.205 --> 02:40:34.360
MATT: "Hey."

02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:35.820
MARISHA: Looking good.

02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:37.101
MATT: (deep voice) "Why thank you.

02:40:37.101 --> 02:40:40.813
“I appreciate the
words of confidence."

02:40:40.813 --> 02:40:42.230
TRAVIS: (laughs) Gun show.

02:40:45.067 --> 02:40:48.970
MARISHA: I'm going to just
lean on this bench next to me,

02:40:48.970 --> 02:40:50.005
and that's my turn.

02:40:50.005 --> 02:40:52.660
MATT: Okay, you got it.

02:40:52.660 --> 02:40:53.870
Yasha, your turn.

02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:55.410
ASHLEY: Okay, so...

02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:01.830
feeling a lot
of shame and embarrassment,

02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:04.890
I will turn around to the vrock,
and I will attack the vrock.

02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:06.955
MATT: Go for it.

02:41:06.955 --> 02:41:07.755
Recklessly?

02:41:07.755 --> 02:41:08.555
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:12.853
Oh!

02:41:12.853 --> 02:41:14.865
TALIESIN: That die
is so frustrating.

02:41:14.865 --> 02:41:16.230
ASHLEY: It is.

02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:17.546
Oh shit!

02:41:17.546 --> 02:41:18.380
Now that was cocked.

02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:20.630
MATT: It was cocked, and
your rolled a one, and then--

02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:22.629
ASHLEY: And then I
rolled a two, so nine.

02:41:22.629 --> 02:41:23.838
MATT: A total of nine to hit?

02:41:23.838 --> 02:41:24.638
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:41:24.638 --> 02:41:25.930
MATT: First strike misses.

02:41:25.930 --> 02:41:28.610
Second attack, reckless?

02:41:28.610 --> 02:41:30.538
Yeah.

02:41:30.538 --> 02:41:32.790
ASHLEY: 18.

02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:33.590
17.

02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:35.078
Okay, so 18.
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

02:41:35.078 --> 02:41:36.138
Go ahead and roll damage.

02:41:36.138 --> 02:41:38.237
This is full damage, because it's
your first strike in the turn,

02:41:38.237 --> 02:41:39.563
so you got to roll additional d6.

02:41:39.563 --> 02:41:42.960
ASHLEY: I roll an additional d6, right.

02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:46.083
Okay, so that is eight.

02:41:46.083 --> 02:41:48.500
MATT: If you want, remember,
you can reroll one of the die

02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:49.960
if you have Savage Attacker.

02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:51.452
ASHLEY: Oh yeah.

02:41:51.452 --> 02:41:53.832
LAURA: Tight!

02:41:53.832 --> 02:41:54.870
MATT: Same.

02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:56.075
ASHLEY: 13 points of damage.

02:41:56.075 --> 02:41:58.815
MATT: 13 points of damage to the vrock.
TRAVIS: Copy that.

02:41:58.815 --> 02:41:59.655
MATT: All righty.

02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:03.620
Fjord, you're up.

02:42:06.506 --> 02:42:08.718
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:42:08.718 --> 02:42:09.760
What the hell am I doing?

02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:12.490
Oh, I'm going to look
at Yasha and say:

02:42:12.490 --> 02:42:14.290
I’ll take you up on that
grief and regret,

02:42:14.290 --> 02:42:17.921
and I will continue to
pull 4d8 necrotic damage--

02:42:17.921 --> 02:42:19.630
TALIESIN: I think you
saw her turn, though?

02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:20.918
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did.
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:42:20.918 --> 02:42:22.960
MATT: All right, go for it.
MARISHA: Ha, ha, ha!

02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:23.760
TALIESIN: Oh!

02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:25.688
Oh, I get what's
happening now, Okay.

02:42:28.220 --> 02:42:30.140
TRAVIS: 19 points
of necrotic damage.

02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:31.640
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: 19 points.

02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:33.970
MATT: That's your action,
and then then you heal nine.

02:42:33.970 --> 02:42:35.190
TRAVIS: Yes.
LIAM: Awesome.

02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:36.440
MARISHA: That's cool.

02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:38.632
MATT: (laughs) That's pretty rad.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:42:38.632 --> 02:42:41.180
MARISHA: It's very warlocktastic.
I'm into it.

02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:43.765
TRAVIS: And I will move--

02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:49.710
can I move over here
behind this pillar,

02:42:49.710 --> 02:42:51.895
and just lean against
like, (groaning) fuck!

02:42:51.895 --> 02:42:53.270
MATT: You got it.

02:42:53.270 --> 02:42:54.390
LIAM: Cool move.

02:42:54.390 --> 02:42:56.080
MATT: All right, Pumat's turn.

02:42:56.080 --> 02:42:58.370
MARISHA: We’re all at
that point in the fight.

02:42:58.370 --> 02:43:00.539
MATT: Yeah, Pumat's
seeing you guys looking rugged,

02:43:00.539 --> 02:43:02.690
sees everyone rushing
through, and goes like,

02:43:02.690 --> 02:43:07.810
"Hey, there's more guys coming.

02:43:07.810 --> 02:43:10.133
“I'll take care of
this, you go ahead."

02:43:10.133 --> 02:43:12.300
(laughter)

02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:15.040
MATT: And he's going to go ahead
and move his hands like this,

02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:16.730
and as he does, you watch wind--

02:43:16.730 --> 02:43:19.000
MARISHA: Oh my god.
LAURA: I love him.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.720
MATT: (whooshing)
Until a whirlwind

02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:25.960
suddenly pulls up in the
middle of the chamber,

02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:30.790
and (whooshing) begins
to carve across this way.

02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:34.780
LAURA: Does it make it hard for
things to fly around the room,

02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:36.106
maybe?

02:43:36.106 --> 02:43:37.746
MATT: It can.

02:43:37.746 --> 02:43:40.570
MARISHA: Does it just
suck up flying creatures?

02:43:40.570 --> 02:43:43.815
SAM: Does it strip the feathers
off of any winged creature?

02:43:43.815 --> 02:43:46.315
LAURA: And turn them into like
a little Thanksgiving turkey.

02:43:46.315 --> 02:43:47.550
LIAM: (gobbling)

02:43:47.550 --> 02:43:49.690
TALIESIN: Happy Thanksgiving!

02:43:49.690 --> 02:43:52.150
MATT: 10-foot
radius, 30-foot high cylinder.

02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:53.600
So this.

02:43:57.580 --> 02:43:59.189
Here we go.

02:43:59.189 --> 02:44:02.445
TALIESIN: Look at
all these toys.

02:44:02.445 --> 02:44:05.355
LAURA: (whispering) Oh my gosh!

02:44:05.355 --> 02:44:08.260
MATT: 30 feet in direction.

02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:13.400
So he will cast it and move...

02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:15.380
First appear here.

02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:25.300
(whooshing) Five,
10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:27.640
It gets that far.

02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:29.920
So the wind is whipping
and kicking around.

02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:31.570
Glass shards are
being caught up in it

02:44:31.570 --> 02:44:33.640
and spinning around
inside the vortex.

02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:37.920
The vrock takes a 10d6
bludgeoning damage on a failed save.

02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:39.100
LAURA: Whoa!

02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:41.517
MATT: So go ahead and roll a
dexterity save for the vrock.

02:44:41.517 --> 02:44:42.890
TRAVIS: Will do.

02:44:42.890 --> 02:44:44.970
LAURA: One, one, one, one!

02:44:48.874 --> 02:44:49.900
TRAVIS: 19.

02:44:49.900 --> 02:44:51.506
MATT: 19? Okay.

02:44:57.532 --> 02:44:58.816
It takes...

02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:07.456
14 points of
bludgeoning damage.

02:45:07.456 --> 02:45:09.290
And give it a strength
saving throw, please.

02:45:09.290 --> 02:45:11.090
TRAVIS: You got it.

02:45:11.090 --> 02:45:13.350
There's nothing to this,
it's just a straight roll,

02:45:13.350 --> 02:45:15.080
which is a nine.
MATT: A nine.

02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:16.802
It is restrained and
pulled along with it.

02:45:16.802 --> 02:45:19.109
MARISHA: Yay, it's sucked up in it!
TALIESIN: Not an attack of opportunity?

02:45:19.109 --> 02:45:20.720
MATT: No, because
it's forced movement.

02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:22.595
TALIESIN: No, its forced
movement, thank you.

02:45:22.595 --> 02:45:24.845
MATT: But the vrock gets
pulled up into the whirlwind,

02:45:24.845 --> 02:45:27.350
and you see giant Pumat
Swole guiding it around.

02:45:27.350 --> 02:45:30.010
The other cultists that are
rushing into like, “Shit!”

02:45:30.010 --> 02:45:31.510
And they're seeing
the whirlwind.

02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:32.310
He's like, "Go!"

02:45:32.310 --> 02:45:34.720
TRAVIS: If we get out of here, we won't
have to worry about the vrock.

02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:36.405
We got to go, we got to
go, got to go, got to go.

02:45:36.405 --> 02:45:38.280
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Downstairs then, huh?

02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:39.605
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Ugh.

02:45:39.605 --> 02:45:42.060
MARISHA: Oh, wait. Oh no.

02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:43.060
Oh no.

02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:44.440
SAM: What?

02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:46.540
MARISHA: I think it's
Inevitable End's turn.

02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:48.840
LIAM: She could also have joined them
through the floor.

02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:50.507
LAURA: She might have
already gone back.

02:45:50.507 --> 02:45:53.020
LIAM: We don’t know.

02:45:53.860 --> 02:45:55.296
MATT: She doesn't show up.

02:45:55.296 --> 02:45:57.040
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:59.445
MATT: Caduceus?

02:45:59.445 --> 02:46:02.438
TALIESIN: How many
feet am I from--

02:46:02.438 --> 02:46:04.730
MATT: We'll say for the
purposes of the narrative here,

02:46:04.730 --> 02:46:07.740
they are very focused on
Pumat and the whirlwind.

02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:09.210
You guys could--

02:46:09.210 --> 02:46:12.563
TALIESIN: I was going to say, do I need to use
my action as well, or am I okay?

02:46:12.563 --> 02:46:13.980
MATT: You guys
would probably want

02:46:13.980 --> 02:46:15.540
to use your action to dash.

02:46:15.540 --> 02:46:17.062
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll dash.

02:46:17.062 --> 02:46:19.620
SAM: (yelling) Hand!

02:46:19.620 --> 02:46:22.198
TRAVIS: We all run by and
bitch slap Nott as we go by

02:46:22.198 --> 02:46:24.656
and try and snap her out of it.
LAURA: Nott's already down.

02:46:24.656 --> 02:46:26.156
TRAVIS: Can we still
bitch slap her?

02:46:26.156 --> 02:46:27.210
(laughter)

02:46:27.210 --> 02:46:29.520
LIAM: We’ll do it to Sam on the break.

02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:30.650
SAM: Nott!

02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:32.385
MARISHA: We all run.

02:46:32.385 --> 02:46:35.620
MATT: As you all begin
to dart through the door

02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:38.220
into the below chamber,
the doors open.

02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:44.880
(crashing) Lightless below,
a staircase that descends.

02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:48.234
Goggles forward, what
is your marching order?

02:46:48.234 --> 02:46:50.998
LAURA: Well, whoever would
get there first, I feel like--

02:46:50.998 --> 02:46:52.790
MATT: It would take a
little bit for Jester

02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:53.999
to get caught up to you guys.

02:46:53.999 --> 02:46:55.437
So you guys are
waiting up for Jester?

02:46:55.437 --> 02:46:57.748
TALIESIN: Once we're in there,
we're going to get everybody in

02:46:57.748 --> 02:46:59.840
and I'm going to try
and barricade the door.

02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:02.285
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: I'll take second position.

02:47:02.285 --> 02:47:05.395
MARISHA: Well, I'lltake the charge. 
I think I'm closest.

02:47:05.395 --> 02:47:07.990
MATT: Okay, so Beauregard's
taking the charge.

02:47:07.990 --> 02:47:09.850
Yasha is the second fastest.

02:47:09.850 --> 02:47:11.220
TALIESIN: I'll go behind Yasha.

02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:13.392
LIAM: I do, my
partner is down below.

02:47:13.392 --> 02:47:14.601
Oh, you're talking about him?

02:47:14.601 --> 02:47:16.480
MATT: Caleb?

02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:18.845
LIAM: Yeah, number two.

02:47:18.845 --> 02:47:20.670
MATT: All right.

02:47:20.670 --> 02:47:23.160
As you guys dart
and close the door

02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:25.227
behind Jester, who's
the last one through,

02:47:25.227 --> 02:47:26.551
you begin to barricade it.

02:47:26.551 --> 02:47:29.310
And there is like a barricade
point that comes down.

02:47:29.310 --> 02:47:31.055
It's a little flimsy.

02:47:31.055 --> 02:47:32.430
But if you have
anything else you

02:47:32.430 --> 02:47:34.800
want to add to it that would
possibly hold it in place.

02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:36.592
TRAVIS: Is there a
keyhole in there at all?

02:47:36.592 --> 02:47:38.230
TALIESIN: We don't
have the dagger.

02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:39.800
LAURA: Nott has the thing.

02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:42.420
MARISHA: Oh, I'm looking at you
like you're with us. You’re not.

02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:44.550
ASHLEY: Are we doing
a new initiative

02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:45.840
roll to go down there?

02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:48.180
MATT: Depending what happens
following initiative.

02:47:48.180 --> 02:47:50.684
Once you guys got through
this door and closed it,

02:47:50.684 --> 02:47:52.950
combat for you has ended.

02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:55.498
Do you wish to
barricade anything else?

02:47:55.498 --> 02:47:57.607
MARISHA: Combat for
all of us has ended?

02:47:57.607 --> 02:48:00.560
MATT: You guys have gotten in the room
and closed it, and then put the thing down.

02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:01.977
You're not immediately in combat.

02:48:01.977 --> 02:48:04.920
You hear wind (whooshing) on the
other side, and people yelling,

02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:07.613
and creatures screaming.

02:48:07.613 --> 02:48:09.670
MARISHA: How many
rounds was that?

02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:11.990
MATT: I don't remember. It was like, 
three or four, maybe?

02:48:11.990 --> 02:48:13.393
TALIESIN: Nott's faster
than us, anyway.

02:48:13.393 --> 02:48:15.710
TRAVIS: We can't use the lash,
it doesn't work like that.

02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:18.127
MARISHA: My Lightning Gloves
are technically still up.

02:48:18.127 --> 02:48:20.377
LIAM: I am going to take a
moment to use minor alchemy

02:48:20.377 --> 02:48:23.510
and turn the wooden
barricade slat to stone.

02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:25.310
MARISHA: Ooh, that's
funsies!

02:48:25.310 --> 02:48:26.420
MATT: You reach up.

02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:28.710
(whooshing) It turns into solid
stone, blocking the doors.

02:48:28.710 --> 02:48:31.530
It'll hold for-- how
long does that last for?

02:48:31.530 --> 02:48:33.395
LIAM: Ooh, I have to
spend time doing it.

02:48:33.395 --> 02:48:34.195
LAURA: Okay.

02:48:34.195 --> 02:48:36.570
Well, how about once we get
down the steps a little bit,

02:48:36.570 --> 02:48:38.172
I'm going to use the wand.

02:48:38.172 --> 02:48:39.881
And I'm going to cast
Grease on the floor

02:48:39.881 --> 02:48:44.575
right underneath the door, so that anything 
coming through will slip and fall, at least.

02:48:44.575 --> 02:48:46.513
TALIESIN: How long do you have to spend--
MATT: It lasts for one minute.

02:48:46.513 --> 02:48:47.930
LIAM: Five to 10 minutes--

02:48:47.930 --> 02:48:49.680
LAURA: I'll do it right
as we get in the--

02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:51.722
TALIESIN: Well, if you're
going to do that, I can

02:48:51.722 --> 02:48:54.509
run a mass healing for 10 minutes,
if we let them have 10 minutes.

02:48:54.509 --> 02:48:57.870
TRAVIS: Do both of them. We're going
to need one for sure.

02:48:57.870 --> 02:48:59.073
MARISHA: We can't fight Obann--

02:48:59.073 --> 02:49:01.304
MATT: So you're going to
focus and turn it to stone.

02:49:01.304 --> 02:49:02.721
You're going to
cast Mass Healing?

02:49:02.721 --> 02:49:04.488
TALIESIN: I'm going
to cast Mass Healing.

02:49:04.488 --> 02:49:07.655
I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing, I mean, 
excuse me, since we're doing it.

02:49:07.655 --> 02:49:10.270
Let's do that at 4th-level. Fuck it.

02:49:10.270 --> 02:49:11.485
MARISHA: Yes, please.

02:49:11.485 --> 02:49:14.310
TALIESIN: Since everyone's down.

02:49:14.310 --> 02:49:16.870
LIAM: Is the door made
of stone or metal?

02:49:16.890 --> 02:49:18.530
The door
that we just shut.

02:49:18.530 --> 02:49:20.800
MATT: The door you
just shut is made

02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:22.460
of what you guess to be metal.

02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:24.720
LIAM: Metal, okay.

02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:26.234
Okay.

02:49:26.234 --> 02:49:29.160
SAM: (As Pumat) Let me in!
LAURA: Oh, Pumat!

02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:31.650
TALIESIN: 19 points to everybody.
LAURA: We locked him out.

02:49:31.650 --> 02:49:35.850
SAM: (As Pumat) I can't open this stone barrier.

02:49:35.850 --> 02:49:38.680
MATT: You hear-- the
demons keep coming.

02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:39.930
TALIESIN: 19 points to everybody.

02:49:39.930 --> 02:49:41.282
LAURA: Pumat!

02:49:43.105 --> 02:49:46.070
SAM: That's somebody
else's problem.

02:49:46.070 --> 02:49:49.217
ASHLEY: Beau is in front of
me, and I will very sheepishly--

02:49:49.217 --> 02:49:51.461
SAM: (As Pumat)
They're overcoming me.

02:49:51.461 --> 02:49:54.820
ASHLEY: -- put my hand
over where I stabbed her,

02:49:54.820 --> 02:49:56.310
and I will cast Healing Hands.

02:49:56.310 --> 02:49:57.360
SAM: Aw.

02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:00.405
ASHLEY: And she’ll restore an extra 10 hit points.

02:50:00.405 --> 02:50:01.950
MARISHA: I'll take it.

02:50:01.950 --> 02:50:03.810
LAURA: He couldn't
have like, backed

02:50:03.810 --> 02:50:07.635
up and still controlled the wind
and come in with us, at least?

02:50:07.635 --> 02:50:09.300
TRAVIS: He's enormous.

02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:10.956
TALIESIN: Yeah. Giant.

02:50:10.956 --> 02:50:13.290
MATT: If you want to reopen
the doors and check and see?

02:50:13.290 --> 02:50:15.830
TRAVIS: No, we'll keep going.
SAM: (As Pumat) I'm dying.

02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:18.300
LIAM: Not stone, I'll do iron.
I'll make that slat iron.

02:50:18.300 --> 02:50:19.580
MATT: Okay.

02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:23.850
LAURA: Can we have reopened it
before we turned them to stone?

02:50:23.850 --> 02:50:26.548
MATT: If you want
to open the door--

02:50:26.548 --> 02:50:28.108
LAURA: But it's Pumat!

02:50:28.108 --> 02:50:30.510
LIAM: He told us to go.
MARISHA: He told us to go.

02:50:31.458 --> 02:50:33.938
ASHLEY: Well, how many
were in there with him?

02:50:37.410 --> 02:50:39.172
MARISHA: He'll be all right.

02:50:39.172 --> 02:50:41.550
TRAVIS: There's like
four of him, it's cool.

02:50:41.550 --> 02:50:44.370
SAM: (laughs)
He's got backups.

02:50:44.370 --> 02:50:46.901
MATT: So how much did everyone heal?
TALIESIN: 19 points to everybody.

02:50:46.901 --> 02:50:49.380
MATT: So everyone heals 19 points 
if you haven't marked it already.

02:50:49.380 --> 02:50:51.547
TRAVIS: Is there any other
healing spells we'll get,

02:50:51.547 --> 02:50:53.172
or should we be
drinking these puppies?

02:50:53.172 --> 02:50:54.922
Or are we also going
to take a short rest?

02:50:54.922 --> 02:50:56.362
LAURA: We're not
taking a short rest.

02:50:56.362 --> 02:50:58.337
TALIESIN: I was going to say,
if we're taking a short rest,

02:50:58.337 --> 02:51:00.868
then I did not pull that fucking
spell, because that's-- yeah.

02:51:00.868 --> 02:51:02.958
LAURA: We're not taking a short rest.
SAM: I'm going to drink my potion.

02:51:02.958 --> 02:51:04.583
TRAVIS: I'm going to drink mine.
MARISHA: I'm going to drink my potion as well.

02:51:04.583 --> 02:51:05.916
MATT: Do it, drink your potions.

02:51:05.916 --> 02:51:08.453
MARISHA: I’ve held onto his potion for a while.
LIAM: Same.

02:51:08.453 --> 02:51:10.370
TRAVIS: What is it, plus
four to these things?

02:51:10.370 --> 02:51:12.389
MARISHA: Plus four
right, to the regulars?

02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:14.345
TRAVIS: Seven plus four--
MARISHA: Three, six--

02:51:14.345 --> 02:51:16.560
SAM: So it's four plus four?

02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:18.916
MATT: No, no, no the
regulars are plus two.

02:51:18.916 --> 02:51:21.133
It's whatever
roll plus two.

02:51:21.133 --> 02:51:22.360
<i>That's</i> plus four.

02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:25.058
And the big one is plus eight.

02:51:25.058 --> 02:51:26.544
MARISHA: All right.

02:51:29.270 --> 02:51:32.360
TRAVIS: I look at Yasha, and
I'm like, sorry, and pull more--

02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:33.846
no, I'm just teasing.

02:51:33.846 --> 02:51:35.473
(laughter)

02:51:35.473 --> 02:51:37.890
TALIESIN: Actually, I don't
know where my physical one is.

02:51:37.890 --> 02:51:39.700
I think it's under you.

02:51:39.700 --> 02:51:41.520
I can hand you a potion--

02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:44.490
MARISHA: We just
drank a lot of gold.

02:51:44.490 --> 02:51:47.250
LAURA: All right, is anybody
still low, like super low?

02:51:47.250 --> 02:51:48.940
MARISHA: I'm 20 points down.

02:51:48.940 --> 02:51:50.232
TRAVIS: I'm 51 points down.

02:51:50.232 --> 02:51:52.491
LAURA: (whispering) 51 points down!
TALIESIN: Even after that? Oh wow!

02:51:52.491 --> 02:51:54.610
TRAVIS: I got my
shit handed to me.

02:51:54.610 --> 02:51:57.092
LAURA: Okay, okay, I'm
going to go up to Fjord,

02:51:57.092 --> 02:52:01.950
and I'm going to cast a-- oh my god--
1st-level Cure Wounds.

02:52:01.950 --> 02:52:03.333
Sorry, that I don't have more.

02:52:03.333 --> 02:52:04.667
SAM: I guess I had another one.

02:52:04.667 --> 02:52:10.300
TRAVIS: Or should we save
it for like a medevac thing?

02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:11.550
TALIESIN: Potions are potions.

02:52:11.550 --> 02:52:13.766
Once you go down,
you can't use it.

02:52:13.766 --> 02:52:16.215
TRAVIS: I mean, like a spell?

02:52:16.215 --> 02:52:17.831
TALIESIN: Yeah, spells-- yeah.

02:52:17.831 --> 02:52:19.890
MATT: As you guys
are waiting here,

02:52:19.890 --> 02:52:23.466
you hear the wind died down
after a little while outside.

02:52:23.466 --> 02:52:26.693
And then you hear
(arrows flying).

02:52:26.693 --> 02:52:28.360
There's battle just
going the whole time

02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:30.150
you guys are resting here.

02:52:30.150 --> 02:52:31.770
You finish, you've healed.

02:52:31.770 --> 02:52:34.020
You've taken that moment
to seal the door with iron.

02:52:34.020 --> 02:52:35.847
Are you guys moving on?

02:52:35.847 --> 02:52:37.600
TALIESIN: It's only been 10 minutes.
MATT: Okay.

02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:39.850
MARISHA: Yasha?
ASHLEY: Yeah?

02:52:39.850 --> 02:52:42.240
LAURA: There's no way--
I mean-- okay.

02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:43.620
TRAVIS: What?

02:52:43.620 --> 02:52:46.910
LAURA: It's just Pumat.
He's going to die out there!

02:52:46.910 --> 02:52:50.070
MATT: Beau, what
were you saying?

02:52:50.070 --> 02:52:53.900
MARISHA: It's good to have
you back, like back-back.

02:52:53.900 --> 02:52:57.480
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm very sorry.

02:52:57.480 --> 02:52:59.172
I did not know what I was doing.

02:52:59.722 --> 02:53:01.438
MARISHA: Yeah, we know.

02:53:07.536 --> 02:53:09.070
ASHLEY: Please forgive me.

02:53:09.070 --> 02:53:12.990
I-- I don't know how
I can make any of you

02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:17.022
trust me again, because I
don't even trust myself.

02:53:17.022 --> 02:53:19.406
LAURA: I go hug Yasha
around the waist.

02:53:22.105 --> 02:53:24.360
ASHLEY: (whispering)
Thank you, Jester.

02:53:26.694 --> 02:53:31.370
TRAVIS: You can start by helping
us kill this fucking thing.

02:53:31.370 --> 02:53:34.300
MARISHA: Yeah well,
we'll talk later.

02:53:34.300 --> 02:53:36.010
Now is not a good place.

02:53:36.010 --> 02:53:38.685
ASHLEY: Yes, I think we
have a job to finish.

02:53:38.685 --> 02:53:41.031
I start walking.

02:53:41.031 --> 02:53:43.910
MATT: As you all follow suit
one by one, heading down

02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:47.590
the 10-foot wide descending
space into the depths

02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:51.204
beneath the Chantry of the Dawn,
we're going to take a break.

02:53:51.204 --> 02:53:52.566
(sighing)

02:53:52.566 --> 02:53:54.385
MARISHA: Three hours!

02:53:57.813 --> 02:54:01.485
It's the first time I've
been nervous in a while.

02:54:01.485 --> 02:54:05.160
First day with a little limpy.

02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:07.700
MATT: So we'll see what
the next stage is here.

02:54:07.700 --> 02:54:09.926
TALIESIN: For you, it was like 14 points.
ASHLEY: That's great.

02:54:09.926 --> 02:54:12.430
MATT: We'll be back
here in a few minutes.

02:54:12.430 --> 02:54:14.650
In the meantime, we do
have our giveaway tonight.

02:54:14.650 --> 02:54:17.850
MARISHA: I think that was a longer
first half than last week's.

02:54:17.850 --> 02:54:21.330
MATT: Yeah, that
was a confrontation.

02:54:21.330 --> 02:54:23.800
TRAVIS: 10 hours. Three hours?
MATT: Sure.

02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:25.170
TRAVIS: 10 hours.

02:54:25.170 --> 02:54:27.650
MATT: We have the
Purpleheart dice tray,

02:54:27.650 --> 02:54:29.290
the Scanlan special,
if you will,

02:54:29.290 --> 02:54:31.450
going to one lucky
winner in the chat room.

02:54:31.450 --> 02:54:33.760
The codename tonight is Storm.

02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:35.750
Put it in once,
not more than once,

02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:36.850
or you'll be disqualified.

02:54:36.850 --> 02:54:39.790
US and Canada only, excluding
Quebec, because stupid laws.

02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:41.840
We'll have a winner
for you shortly.

GLENN: Hey, what's up, Critters?

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:35.400
It's Glenn with OSD.

02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:38.370
I just wanted to send
y'all a thank you message,

02:55:38.370 --> 02:55:41.460
and my gratitude for all the
hard work so far this month.

02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:43.240
The Critters thus
far have raised

02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:46.083
enough money to be able to
impact over 400 veterans.

02:55:46.083 --> 02:55:47.250
We're here in our warehouse.

02:55:47.250 --> 02:55:49.167
We're putting together
additional supply drops

02:55:49.167 --> 02:55:51.450
for our troops overseas,
including a million cups

02:55:51.450 --> 02:55:54.750
of coffee, video games, lots
of board games, as you can see,

02:55:54.750 --> 02:55:56.790
as well as putting
together different supplies

02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:58.843
for our chapters that
they're doing out

02:55:58.843 --> 02:56:01.630
in the local community, whether
it's underprivileged kids, it's the homeless.

02:56:01.630 --> 02:56:03.355
All these different
things, we're

02:56:03.355 --> 02:56:06.270
being able to make happen
for veterans by veterans

02:56:06.270 --> 02:56:07.980
and with veterans,
because we know

02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:10.720
that service to one's community
is so gosh-darn important.

02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:11.842
So thank you again.

02:56:11.842 --> 02:56:13.631
If you want to
continue to support,

02:56:13.631 --> 02:56:15.660
visit critrole.com/OSD.

02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:18.660
That's critrole.com/OSD.

02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:20.410
We've still got half
the month to go.

02:56:20.410 --> 02:56:22.740
So if we've hit 400
now, let's push it.

02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:24.480
Let's try to do 800,
and let's really

02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:27.360
make a difference as we
head through Thanksgiving

02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:29.370
into Christmas and into 2020.

02:56:29.370 --> 02:56:31.740
Thank you again.

02:56:31.740 --> 02:56:34.000
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time
on Talks Machina.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.080
BRIAN: Do you know what I just thought of?
DANI: What?

02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:41.040
BRIAN: Three years ago tonight,
this show first premiered.

02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:42.965
How cool is that?

02:56:42.965 --> 02:56:44.400
It's kind of our birthday.

02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:46.400
It's our three year--
LIAM: It's fucking unreal.

02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.110
BRIAN: -- birthday. It's pretty crazy.

02:56:48.110 --> 02:56:51.930
DANI: You totally messaged
us about it this morning,

02:56:51.930 --> 02:56:53.130
and then I totally forgot.

02:56:53.130 --> 02:56:56.350
LIAM: No, but it's so lovely.
BRIAN: It's great.

02:56:56.350 --> 02:56:59.550
LIAM: I'll be the first
to say, I didn't think

02:56:59.550 --> 02:57:00.898
this show made sense at all.

02:57:00.898 --> 02:57:03.940
BRIAN: Do you think it does now? What has changed?
MARISHA: Really?

02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:06.803
LIAM: Well, I thought, just
let it play out at the table.

02:57:06.803 --> 02:57:09.345
Who's going to want to listen
to us talk about our bullshit--

02:57:09.345 --> 02:57:10.345
BRIAN: Oh, I understand.

02:57:10.345 --> 02:57:12.840
LIAM: -- D&amp;D character
shit that's in our heads?

02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:14.070
I was wrong.

02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:16.157
(grumbled words)
BRIAN: Do cuttlefish for us.

02:57:16.157 --> 02:57:17.341
Remember cuttlefish?

02:57:17.341 --> 02:57:19.810
LIAM: (squeaky voice) cuttlefish.

02:57:19.810 --> 02:57:21.654
Hi, I'm a cuttlefish.

02:57:21.654 --> 02:57:24.094
Happy Christmas, everybody!

02:57:24.094 --> 02:57:27.022
(laughter)

02:57:27.022 --> 02:57:28.486
Auld Lang Syne!

02:57:28.486 --> 02:57:30.220
BRIAN: It's one of my favorites.

02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:31.730
It's one of my favorites.

02:57:31.730 --> 02:57:33.505
It's hard to beat. Okay.

02:57:33.505 --> 02:57:35.380
DANI: Answer all your
questions like that.

02:57:35.380 --> 02:57:37.968
LIAM: (squeaky voice)
Fröhliche Weihnachten! Hey, I'm German.

02:57:37.968 --> 02:57:39.780
(laughter)

02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:41.960
LIAM: Ooh!

02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:45.280
"Watching Jester's late
night conversation with The Gentleman

02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:48.020
“was really moving, (not just
for the wonderful RP, but also,

02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:50.270
“there are those of us in the
community who can connect

02:57:50.270 --> 02:57:51.485
“to having an absent parent).

02:57:51.485 --> 02:57:54.926
“What was your experience
sitting at the table during that scene?"

02:57:54.926 --> 02:58:00.252
MARISHA: It was being front row
in like experimental black box.

02:58:00.252 --> 02:58:01.940
LIAM: With a world-class actor.

02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:04.300
MARISHA: God, so good. So fucking good!

02:58:04.300 --> 02:58:07.748
LIAM: Yeah, we've talked about this before. Laura Bailey--
MARISHA: Laura is good.

02:58:07.748 --> 02:58:11.620
LIAM: Just nominated for an
award in the gaming industry today.

02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:13.890
I've said--
MARISHA: Was she really?

02:58:13.890 --> 02:58:16.400
LIAM: -- 20 times,
my favorite actor--

02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:18.030
that's the end of the sentence.

02:58:18.030 --> 02:58:18.830
BRIAN: Yeah.

02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:20.955
LIAM: Yeah, Laura is a
fucking beautiful performer.

02:58:20.955 --> 02:58:23.210
MARISHA: Fucking great
to watch, man, up close.

02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:26.960
And you got like the subtleties
of her crying pretty much

02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:29.900
the second The
Gentleman rejected her

02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:32.630
when we were all sitting
there, when we were

02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:35.000
all talking to him initially.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.970
Because as soon as she
starts with that, then

02:58:37.970 --> 02:58:40.820
you have to go through
the process of like,

02:58:40.820 --> 02:58:43.534
Beau would see that
Jester's crying.

02:58:43.534 --> 02:58:51.390
Beau knows she's in a
conference room in the middle

02:58:51.390 --> 02:58:53.610
of an important conversation.

02:58:53.610 --> 02:58:57.210
You have to be
focused at these things.

02:58:57.210 --> 02:58:59.610
I don't know, it's just so good.

02:58:59.610 --> 02:59:01.180
She's great at adding layers.

02:59:01.180 --> 02:59:03.471
It's fucking awesome.

02:59:03.471 --> 02:59:05.390
LIAM: She's just a
phenomenal actor.

02:59:05.390 --> 02:59:07.830
BRIAN: Great moment in this campaign.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

02:59:07.830 --> 02:59:10.010
BRIAN: Well, definitely
a highlight, for sure.

02:59:10.010 --> 02:59:12.330
LIAM: Don't let her see this
episode of Talks Machina,

02:59:12.330 --> 02:59:14.640
because if she hears us
compliment her like that,

02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:17.550
she will be intolerable
for two weeks.

02:59:17.550 --> 02:59:20.310
BRIAN: She has never seen
an episode of this show

02:59:20.310 --> 02:59:21.900
that she wasn't on.

02:59:21.900 --> 02:59:24.090
DANI: Yeah, technically, she hasn't seen
those, because she's in them.

02:59:24.090 --> 02:59:26.674
BRIAN: She doesn't even see those,
because she's in them, yeah.

02:59:26.674 --> 02:59:30.750
Our winner for this week was
sent in by Christina Silvoso,

02:59:30.750 --> 02:59:33.200
@xtinaiscrafty.

02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:34.550
Let's take a look.

02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:36.980
LIAM: (singing) She's crafty.

02:59:36.980 --> 02:59:38.580
MARISHA: Aw!
DANI: Yes!

02:59:38.580 --> 02:59:40.440
BRIAN: How about that?

02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:42.255
LIAM: Oh wow!
DANI: So good.

02:59:42.255 --> 02:59:44.250
All these looks!

02:59:44.250 --> 02:59:46.210
BRIAN: Every single one. That's crazy.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:59:46.210 --> 02:59:48.244
MARISHA: Wait, this
is all the same girl?

02:59:48.244 --> 02:59:49.244
DANI: Yeah.
BRIAN: Yeah!

02:59:49.244 --> 02:59:51.250
MARISHA: Oh my god!

02:59:51.250 --> 02:59:53.600
LIAM: I think the Fjord is
my favorite in the lineup.

02:59:53.600 --> 02:59:55.900
But holy shit.
MARISHA: The Caduceus!

02:59:55.900 --> 02:59:58.480
BRIAN: Yeah, but look at
the Nott and the Caleb.

02:59:58.480 --> 03:00:01.394
MARISHA: They're
all pretty great.

03:00:01.394 --> 03:00:03.811
BRIAN: Beau’s really good. The Jester is really good.

03:00:03.811 --> 03:00:05.685
MARISHA: Caleb-- fuck!

03:00:05.685 --> 03:00:09.675
BRIAN: Meany Vizzini--
it's a cool name.

03:00:09.675 --> 03:00:10.940
LIAM: On a theme.

03:00:10.940 --> 03:00:12.930
BRIAN: Meany Vizzini!

03:00:12.930 --> 03:00:18.600
It sounds like a guy
who was sure his scenes

03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:20.520
weren't cut out
of The Sopranos,

03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:21.820
and his friends were like--

03:00:21.820 --> 03:00:22.800
(laughter)

03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:24.870
“Wait, what character
did you play?”

03:00:24.870 --> 03:00:27.610
He's like, “My guy's
name was Meany Vizzini.”

03:00:27.610 --> 03:00:29.820
And they're like, “Nah,
man, they cut your shit.”

03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:32.010
He's like, “Nah, there's
this real good scene, man.

03:00:32.010 --> 03:00:35.078
“Tony looked at me and
he said, ‘More waffles!’”

03:00:35.078 --> 03:00:36.870
We're just get out of
the way of the story.

03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:39.280
"How long has Beau
liked Jester

03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:41.610
“in a ‘more than just
friends’ type of way,

03:00:41.610 --> 03:00:44.259
“and why drop that bomb now?"

03:00:44.259 --> 03:00:45.804
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:00:45.804 --> 03:00:48.184
Mm-hmm!

03:00:51.300 --> 03:00:53.430
BRIAN: Good answer so far.

03:00:53.430 --> 03:00:54.880
Maybe words?

03:00:54.880 --> 03:01:00.275
MARISHA: I have been, obviously,
tagged in this question

03:01:00.275 --> 03:01:01.670
a few times.

03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:02.940
And thinking about it--

03:01:02.940 --> 03:01:05.970
LIAM: Two or three times.

03:01:05.970 --> 03:01:09.195
MARISHA: -- all week-- well,
all weekend and up until now--

03:01:09.195 --> 03:01:12.050
of how I'm going to answer it.

03:01:12.050 --> 03:01:17.373
And it's hard, because there's
no real defining moment.

03:01:17.373 --> 03:01:20.080
You've been through this before.

03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:22.330
LIAM: I have. I don't remember
how it started in campaign one.

03:01:22.330 --> 03:01:24.089
MARISHA: Yeah!
LIAM: It just happened.

03:01:24.089 --> 03:01:28.920
MARISHA: It just happened,
like relationships.

03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:31.065
LIAM: Funny, that.

03:01:31.065 --> 03:01:34.540
MARISHA: Just--
they'll do something,

03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:36.690
and it cocks
your head, and you're

03:01:36.690 --> 03:01:39.690
like, oh fuck, that was cute!

03:01:39.690 --> 03:01:42.463
And you go like, hmm.

03:01:42.463 --> 03:01:44.950
And then you forget about that, 
and then something else happens,

03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:46.797
and then they build, 
and then they build.

03:01:46.797 --> 03:01:48.881
BRIAN: So you're saying
it's been more of a series

03:01:48.881 --> 03:01:51.480
than it is just one moment
that you can point to and say,

03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:54.685
it was right here where
I went like, let's fuck.

03:01:54.685 --> 03:01:56.890
MARISHA: It's not
even like let's fuck!

03:01:56.890 --> 03:01:58.531
BRIAN: I'm joking, I'm joking.
But you know what I'm saying.

03:01:58.531 --> 03:01:59.602
MARISHA: Yes.
LIAM: That's next week.

03:01:59.602 --> 03:02:01.285
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.
BRIAN: Next week, I understand.

03:02:01.285 --> 03:02:02.910
Okay, I'll be sure to
watch that one.

03:02:02.910 --> 03:02:04.125
MARISHA: No, it's nothing--

03:02:04.125 --> 03:02:05.500
DANI: Ooh, level
up coming early.

03:02:05.500 --> 03:02:07.805
MARISHA: --sexual in this case.

03:02:07.805 --> 03:02:09.580
BRIAN: Yeah, right.

03:02:09.580 --> 03:02:11.982
Dani pointing out you guys only
level up after someone has sex.

03:02:11.982 --> 03:02:13.440
LIAM: Yeah, I want
to level up now.

03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:14.540
Make it happen.
(laughter)

03:02:14.540 --> 03:02:16.180
BRIAN: Yeah, exactly.

03:02:16.180 --> 03:02:17.080
Exactly.

03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:19.210
DANI: Campaign's
coming to a close.

03:02:19.210 --> 03:02:21.360
LIAM: I will sleep with
someone every episode

03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:23.590
if it means we can be
at level 20 in 10 weeks.

03:02:23.590 --> 03:02:25.210
BRIAN: Straight up.

03:02:25.210 --> 03:02:26.880
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:29.570
TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

03:02:29.570 --> 03:02:30.920
BRIAN: What the fuck?

03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:32.630
Where have you been, man?

03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:34.375
TRAVIS: (yelling) Hey, yes!

03:02:34.375 --> 03:02:35.465
It worked!

03:02:35.465 --> 03:02:37.290
No more Spooky Ranch, fuck!

03:02:37.290 --> 03:02:38.750
No more pissing my pants!

03:02:38.750 --> 03:02:42.290
Bless you, Minnesota Jones,
you furry little saint!

03:02:42.290 --> 03:02:47.470
BRIAN: Yeah, that fucker realmported 
me here without you.

03:02:47.470 --> 03:02:49.091
This place is a little
fucking weird, man.

03:02:49.091 --> 03:02:52.190
It seems a little early for
the holidays, if you ask me, you know?

03:02:52.190 --> 03:02:56.270
MERRY: What discarded
lump of coal said that?

03:02:56.270 --> 03:02:58.646
It's never too early
for the holidays!

03:02:58.646 --> 03:03:00.782
TRAVIS: Is that a dinosaur?

03:03:00.782 --> 03:03:02.590
BRIAN: What the fuck?

03:03:02.590 --> 03:03:05.180
I swear, dude, this shit is
getting fucking old, man.

03:03:05.180 --> 03:03:10.460
MERRY: You can call me by my
travel name, Merry Sugarplum!

03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:12.290
BRIAN: What the fuck?

03:03:12.290 --> 03:03:14.480
This critter has two names, man.

03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:16.050
I can't fucking do this anymore.

03:03:16.050 --> 03:03:17.840
This is getting excessive.

03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:20.840
MERRY: Well, why don't
you kick the bucket,

03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:23.210
you cheer-siphoning convict?

03:03:23.210 --> 03:03:26.810
(laughter)

03:03:26.810 --> 03:03:28.300
BRIAN: That was--

03:03:28.300 --> 03:03:30.580
TRAVIS: (laughs)
I'm sorry, Rachel--

03:03:30.580 --> 03:03:33.470
I mean, Merry Sugarplum.

03:03:33.470 --> 03:03:36.290
Where are you on vacation from?

03:03:36.290 --> 03:03:39.950
MERRY: Well, Yee-Haw
Prehistoric Ranch, of course.

03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:41.000
TRAVIS: Oh!

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:44.390
MERRY: My family comes here
every year to celebrate

03:03:44.390 --> 03:03:46.540
the great calling of The Ov.

03:03:46.540 --> 03:03:47.720
BRIAN: What the fuck?

03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:49.340
You're from the
Prehistoric Ranch?

03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:51.130
What's that place like?

03:03:51.130 --> 03:03:53.450
MERRY: Have y'all ever
been to Jungle Ranch?

03:03:53.450 --> 03:03:54.320
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:55.145
BRIAN: Yeah.

03:03:55.145 --> 03:03:59.540
MERRY: Basically, that shit,
but with dinosaurs, like me.

03:03:59.540 --> 03:04:02.860
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm
sorry, it's just so happy!

03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:06.330
BRIAN: Wow, the Ov really built
a compelling and unique world,

03:04:06.330 --> 03:04:07.520
it sounds like.

03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:11.150
MERRY: Well, you were built like
a 13-year-old skateboarder who

03:04:11.150 --> 03:04:13.460
sells cigarettes under bleachers.

03:04:13.460 --> 03:04:15.220
TRAVIS: (laughing)

03:04:15.220 --> 03:04:16.519
BRIAN: It's not untrue.

03:04:16.519 --> 03:04:18.868
TRAVIS: You got arrested
for that, didn't you?

03:04:18.868 --> 03:04:20.111
BRIAN: Twice.

03:04:20.111 --> 03:04:23.090
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hey,
Sugarplum, I don't--

03:04:23.090 --> 03:04:25.570
you know, we usually get a
little download when we first

03:04:25.570 --> 03:04:27.950
arrive to these new realms.

03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:30.110
Anything we need
to know about this

03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:31.790
snow-covered festive place?

03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:33.540
MERRY: Mm-hmm.

03:04:33.540 --> 03:04:35.180
Be merry.

03:04:35.180 --> 03:04:37.610
Bring joy to others.

03:04:37.610 --> 03:04:41.210
And most importantly,
refuse the Game Soul.

03:04:41.210 --> 03:04:42.500
BRIAN: That's cool.

03:04:42.500 --> 03:04:43.520
Wait.

03:04:43.520 --> 03:04:46.400
<i>Refuse</i> the Game Soul?
That's like, against everything--

03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:50.398
MERRY: (humming "Jingle Bells")

03:04:52.918 --> 03:04:54.815
TRAVIS: (yelling) Quad kill!

03:04:54.815 --> 03:04:56.966
Come and get some!

03:04:56.966 --> 03:04:59.010
BRIAN: Oh, congrats!
TRAVIS: Thanks, buddy.

03:04:59.010 --> 03:05:01.400
BRIAN: Yeah, let's see
what this is about.

03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:03.055
TRAVIS: What are you in?

03:05:03.055 --> 03:05:05.210
BRIAN: I don’t know,
man, it was in the--

03:05:05.210 --> 03:05:07.650
TRAVIS: (yelling) Are you
in the attack helicopter?

03:05:07.650 --> 03:05:08.780
BRIAN: Yeah.

03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:12.410
I'm just going to go ahead and--
whoa, whoa, whoa, the controls are inverted.

03:05:12.410 --> 03:05:13.955
Nope, I'm just bad.

03:05:13.955 --> 03:05:15.260
TRAVIS: Are we winning?

03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:17.111
BRIAN: We're winning this fight.

03:05:17.111 --> 03:05:18.320
TRAVIS: I think we're losing.

03:05:18.320 --> 03:05:20.102
BRIAN: Nah, we're winning, man.

03:05:20.102 --> 03:05:22.362
(gunshot)

03:05:22.362 --> 03:05:23.330
TRAVIS: Ooh!

03:05:23.330 --> 03:05:25.330
(laughter)

03:05:25.330 --> 03:05:28.530
Yeah, okay.

03:05:28.530 --> 03:05:30.610
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

03:05:30.610 --> 03:05:31.730
BRIAN: You got him!

03:05:31.730 --> 03:05:34.100
TRAVIS: (laughs) That
was just a Hail Mary.

03:05:34.100 --> 03:05:35.260
Oh, that's fucking great.

03:05:35.260 --> 03:05:37.818
What's up?!

03:05:37.818 --> 03:05:40.277
BRIAN: If only Dak Prescott
could nail those as well as you

03:05:40.277 --> 03:05:41.720
do.
TRAVIS: (yelling) Victory!

03:05:41.720 --> 03:05:42.650
BRIAN: What?

03:05:42.650 --> 03:05:43.830
TRAVIS: (yelling) Boom!

03:05:43.830 --> 03:05:44.630
BRIAN: No way.

03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:47.542
TRAVIS: (yelling)
Santa owned your ass!

03:05:47.542 --> 03:05:50.043
BRIAN: Oh, I should take it
out of the plastic before I--

03:05:50.043 --> 03:05:52.020
TRAVIS: Is it fucking
snowing right now?

03:05:52.020 --> 03:05:53.020
(gunshots)

03:05:53.020 --> 03:05:56.390
BRIAN: A lot of people
think maybe I'm not as good

03:05:56.390 --> 03:06:00.050
as I say that I am,
based on how they

03:06:00.050 --> 03:06:01.580
saw me play against those bots.

03:06:01.580 --> 03:06:03.560
But I guarantee
you, I'm far better.

03:06:08.006 --> 03:06:09.405
TRAVIS: Huh.

03:06:09.405 --> 03:06:11.951
BRIAN: Do you want to have duel with these?
You want to come out to the middle,

03:06:11.951 --> 03:06:13.921
and we'll turn our backs to
each other and shoot each other?

03:06:13.921 --> 03:06:14.962
TRAVIS: Like Hamilton?

03:06:14.962 --> 03:06:16.610
BRIAN: Yeah, let's do it.
Where are you? Where are you?

03:06:16.610 --> 03:06:18.410
TRAVIS: I'm going to come up near the house.

03:06:18.410 --> 03:06:19.770
BRIAN and TRAVIS: I'm not
going to shoot you.

03:06:19.770 --> 03:06:21.140
BRIAN: Okay right here, right here!
TRAVIS: I'm here, I'm here.

03:06:21.140 --> 03:06:22.259
BRIAN: Okay, yeah, stay on
the other side of the pond.

03:06:22.259 --> 03:06:24.130
TRAVIS: Oh, you got to look away?

03:06:24.130 --> 03:06:25.730
BRIAN: Okay, so wait. Wait.

03:06:25.730 --> 03:06:27.510
Yeah, stay where you're going to be.
TRAVIS: Yeah, here.

03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:28.420
BRIAN: Stay where
you're going to be.

03:06:28.420 --> 03:06:30.020
TRAVIS: Don't turn away.
BRIAN: No stay--

03:06:30.020 --> 03:06:31.800
TRAVIS: I'm turning away.
BRIAN: Okay, okay.

03:06:31.800 --> 03:06:33.842
TRAVIS: I'm turning away,
you fuckin-- don't you--

03:06:33.842 --> 03:06:35.970
(gunshots)

03:06:35.970 --> 03:06:39.938
(laughter)

03:06:39.938 --> 03:06:42.400
TRAVIS: (laughs) I saw you.

03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:47.034
BRIAN: I will probably
be the last man standing.

03:06:47.034 --> 03:06:49.474
(laughter)

03:06:51.426 --> 03:06:54.120
TRAVIS: Not only did that
work, but I killed myself

03:06:54.120 --> 03:06:56.480
at the same time because I
had to come around the corner

03:06:56.480 --> 03:06:58.912
and look like a dumbass.

03:06:58.912 --> 03:07:01.130
BRIAN: Goddamn, this game's fun.

03:07:01.130 --> 03:07:02.406
Okay, this is match point.

03:07:02.406 --> 03:07:03.206
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:07:03.206 --> 03:07:05.130
BRIAN: I'm not joking.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:07:05.130 --> 03:07:06.589
BRIAN: Come out
here to the center.

03:07:06.589 --> 03:07:07.925
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:07:07.925 --> 03:07:11.200
BRIAN: See if you can
jump over this thing.

03:07:11.200 --> 03:07:12.000
TRAVIS: Like this?

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:13.490
BRIAN: (laughs) Yeah, okay.

03:07:13.490 --> 03:07:16.441
So on the count of
three, let's jump and see

03:07:16.441 --> 03:07:18.150
if we could shoot each
other in the head.

03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:19.462
TRAVIS: Okay, one--
BRIAN: Okay, wait, wait, wait--

03:07:19.462 --> 03:07:21.420
TRAVIS: We've got to--
BRIAN: Wait, wait, wait.

03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:22.830
TRAVIS: Jump on three?
Yes.

03:07:22.830 --> 03:07:24.622
BRIAN: Jump and shoot on three.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:07:24.622 --> 03:07:26.060
BRIAN: One.
TRAVIS: Two.

03:07:26.060 --> 03:07:27.150
BRIAN: Two, three.

03:07:27.150 --> 03:07:27.950
(gunshots)

03:07:27.950 --> 03:07:30.730
BRIAN &amp; TRAVIS: Do it again.
(laughs) One, two, three.

03:07:30.730 --> 03:07:32.190
BRIAN: Wait.

03:07:32.190 --> 03:07:33.650
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

03:07:33.650 --> 03:07:34.960
Okay.
One.

03:07:34.960 --> 03:07:37.052
TRAVIS: Two.
BRIAN: Two, three.

03:07:37.052 --> 03:07:38.461
(gunshots)

03:07:38.461 --> 03:07:40.750
BRIAN: (yelling) We've
got an automatic weapon!

03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:43.080
One, two, three.

03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:44.074
(gunshots)

03:07:44.074 --> 03:07:46.062
(laughs) Oh,
fuck you, fuck you.

03:07:46.062 --> 03:07:49.541
(laughter)

03:07:49.541 --> 03:07:53.020
(gunshots)

03:07:55.505 --> 03:07:58.750
[ominous Western music]

03:09:04.091 --> 03:09:07.445
WILL: Hey everyone,
the insanely talented Will Friedle here.

03:09:07.445 --> 03:09:09.820
I'm excited to announce that
I have a new late night talk

03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:12.445
show coming to the Critical Role
YouTube channel on Wednesdays.

03:09:12.445 --> 03:09:14.243
It's called Mini Primetime.

03:09:14.243 --> 03:09:15.910
It's brought to you
by the same creators

03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:18.750
as that one show
with the hippie kid

03:09:18.750 --> 03:09:20.620
with the bracelets,
whatever that is.

03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:22.900
Anyway, my show,
Mini Primetime,

03:09:22.900 --> 03:09:25.300
is a mini painting show
for beginners and veterans

03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:27.118
alike, where this
handsome face teaches

03:09:27.118 --> 03:09:28.660
the Critical Role
cast how to paint

03:09:28.660 --> 03:09:30.210
their own Mighty Nein minis.

03:09:30.210 --> 03:09:33.070
We're going to be focusing on
specific techniques, fades,

03:09:33.070 --> 03:09:35.710
small detail work, and taking
your mini to next level

03:09:35.710 --> 03:09:36.970
by adding your base.

03:09:36.970 --> 03:09:40.050
So look for it soon on
Critical Role's YouTube.

03:09:40.050 --> 03:09:41.650
Critical Role, What is that?

What is even a critical role?

03:09:43.810 --> 03:09:45.430
Oh, that's right.

that's not a question.

03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:27.800
Whether ‘tis nobler in the
mind to ponder the pros and more

03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:32.720
pros of Twitch or
Twitch Prime, or to take

03:10:32.720 --> 03:10:35.510
hands and gift new subs
to Critters who find

03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:38.880
they can't afford them.

and crew of Crit’cal Role

03:10:51.770 --> 03:10:54.470
might find their naps

To play or sleep.

No, no sleep, but
just to stream.

03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:18.680
Aye, there's the rub.

Oh man, oh man, oh man,

Oh, that is Twitch poetry.

Oh, anyway, subscribe
to Critical Role.

Use Twitch Prime to subscribe.

03:25:09.142 --> 03:25:14.010
MATT: So battered, but
filled with resolve,

03:25:14.010 --> 03:25:17.640
Yasha returned to your side,
the spell broken that Obann

03:25:17.640 --> 03:25:20.700
has held over her since--

03:25:20.700 --> 03:25:24.510
well, since that time was lost.

03:25:24.510 --> 03:25:28.500
You make your way down to
the darkened stairs about 40,

03:25:28.500 --> 03:25:32.100
50 feet before you come
to an underground floor

03:25:32.100 --> 03:25:34.481
of what you would assume
to be chantry housing.

03:25:34.481 --> 03:25:37.410
There are four chambers in all that
appear to be open bedroom

03:25:37.410 --> 03:25:39.523

03:25:39.523 --> 03:25:43.170
You see a continued stairway down
into a crypt.

03:25:43.170 --> 03:25:46.180
What would you like to do?

03:25:46.180 --> 03:25:48.330
TRAVIS: First of all,
I'd like to turn to Yasha

03:25:48.330 --> 03:25:51.580
and say: You've been down here.

03:25:52.430 --> 03:25:55.450
Mind giving us a sneak peek of
what we're looking forward to?

03:25:56.610 --> 03:25:57.510
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:59.076
MATT: The crypt.

03:26:02.812 --> 03:26:06.110
ASHLEY: I don't exactly
know everything,

03:26:06.110 --> 03:26:11.150
but I know that
we came down here

03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:21.680
to break the shackles off of the
fane, and we needed four of us.

03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:34.070
All I know is that that is down
here, and that was the plan.

03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:36.655
LAURA: Did you succeed?

03:26:37.415 --> 03:26:40.330
ASHLEY: I don't think
we've done it yet.

03:26:40.810 --> 03:26:42.630
MATT: You were in
transit before you

03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:49.725
were notified from a (boom)
upstairs and called to aid.

03:26:49.725 --> 03:26:51.250
TRAVIS: Now they have Nott.

03:26:51.250 --> 03:26:52.970
LAURA: But they have only three.

03:26:52.970 --> 03:26:55.626
LIAM: You haven't done it yet?

03:26:55.626 --> 03:26:56.960
ASHLEY: We haven't done it yet.

03:26:56.960 --> 03:26:59.728
LIAM: And the
Laughing Hand is gone.

03:26:59.728 --> 03:27:02.938
ASHLEY: Yes, and I don't think it
can be successful,

03:27:02.938 --> 03:27:08.880
because Obann looks for very specific
people to do it.

03:27:12.570 --> 03:27:16.510
So as long as nobody
else shows up,

03:27:16.510 --> 03:27:18.240
I don't believe it can succeed.

03:27:18.240 --> 03:27:19.340
TRAVIS: Why you?

03:27:24.696 --> 03:27:30.410
ASHLEY: Well, from
what Obann has told me,

03:27:32.250 --> 03:27:39.880
he has chosen people that he
believes cannot be killed.

03:27:42.810 --> 03:27:50.830
So we continue to go to
every one of these shackles

03:27:50.830 --> 03:27:54.310
and try to break all of them.

03:27:54.310 --> 03:27:57.250
Because when all four
of us break them,

03:27:57.250 --> 03:28:01.696
we die and then we come back,
and then we go to the next one.

03:28:01.696 --> 03:28:03.030
TRAVIS: You say other shackles?

03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:05.056
LAURA: It kills the
people that it does?

03:28:05.056 --> 03:28:07.040
It kills the people?

03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:07.960
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:10.405
MARISHA: But you come back.

03:28:10.405 --> 03:28:13.510
TRAVIS: How many shackles
have you been to?

03:28:13.510 --> 03:28:14.950
ASHLEY: This was the first one.

03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:18.322
LIAM: You said he chooses
people who cannot be killed?

03:28:18.322 --> 03:28:19.750
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I--

03:28:19.750 --> 03:28:22.330
LIAM: You cannot be killed?

03:28:22.330 --> 03:28:25.520
ASHLEY: I feel like that
is not entirely true.

03:28:25.520 --> 03:28:29.980
I think it's just because
of what I am, I guess?

03:28:29.980 --> 03:28:32.560
I just-- I don't know.

03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:33.740
LIAM: What are you?

03:28:33.740 --> 03:28:36.430
ASHLEY: I don't know, I'm--

03:28:36.430 --> 03:28:38.950
I'm just-- I'm me.

03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:44.950
I think just when
I fall, sometimes, I can

03:28:44.950 --> 03:28:47.530
be brought back a lot easier.

03:28:47.530 --> 03:28:48.775
I can die, but I--

03:28:48.775 --> 03:28:52.980
I-- I don't know.

03:28:56.400 --> 03:28:57.610
But I think--

03:29:04.968 --> 03:29:07.130
LIAM: You have spent an
awful lot of time with him.

03:29:07.130 --> 03:29:09.650
What do you think
his next move is?

03:29:15.206 --> 03:29:22.330
ASHLEY: I feel like he will
probably try to bring me

03:29:22.330 --> 03:29:28.390
back to him, and maybe
any of you that he think

03:29:28.390 --> 03:29:29.540
might be useful.

03:29:31.853 --> 03:29:33.270
LAURA: Is there
anything we can do

03:29:33.270 --> 03:29:38.370
to make Yasha stronger on
her resistances or something

03:29:38.370 --> 03:29:41.865
if he tries to do it?

03:29:41.865 --> 03:29:43.725
We could Bless her, right?

03:29:43.725 --> 03:29:49.260
LIAM: Caleb walks up
and cautiously reaches

03:29:49.260 --> 03:29:54.780
above his own head, and places
a pearl against her forehead,

03:29:54.780 --> 03:30:00.210
and small little fractals
and geometric shapes

03:30:00.210 --> 03:30:01.650
appear briefly in the air.

03:30:01.650 --> 03:30:04.920
And I cast Fortune's
Favor on you.

03:30:04.920 --> 03:30:07.060
So you can reroll a save, or--

03:30:12.640 --> 03:30:14.934
ASHLEY: Thank you, Caleb.

03:30:14.934 --> 03:30:17.270
MATT: For the next hour,
you can do that once.

03:30:17.270 --> 03:30:21.710
LIAM: Attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw.

03:30:21.710 --> 03:30:23.480
TRAVIS: Well, we
best not dawdle.

03:30:23.480 --> 03:30:26.120
LAURA: No, Nott's down there.

03:30:26.120 --> 03:30:28.790
If he realizes he can't do it,

03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:31.010
maybe he'll just leave
and take Nott with him.

03:30:36.169 --> 03:30:41.560
MARISHA: Like you said, he's
looking for certain people.

03:30:41.560 --> 03:30:43.060
Can Nott even--

03:30:43.060 --> 03:30:45.930
LAURA: Then he can kill Nott.

03:30:45.930 --> 03:30:48.880
And if I don't get
there soon enough,

03:30:50.110 --> 03:30:53.386
then it will be a lot
harder to bring her back.

03:30:53.386 --> 03:30:55.442
TALIESIN: That'll take time.

03:30:55.442 --> 03:30:59.418
TRAVIS: You know If there are any
traps down here, Yasha?

03:30:59.418 --> 03:31:01.981
MATT: You didn't encounter any.

03:31:01.981 --> 03:31:05.493
ASHLEY: I mean, none that
we would have set off.

03:31:05.493 --> 03:31:08.800
TRAVIS: Then we should move. Now.
TALIESIN: There's the four chambers right here?

03:31:09.150 --> 03:31:14.660
MATT: Yeah, it looks like two and a half
bedchambers and a storage room,

03:31:14.660 --> 03:31:16.130
and one that's a bunch of supplies.

03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:18.470
TALIESIN: Do Iid you hear anything? Is there
anything out of the ordinary?

03:31:18.470 --> 03:31:19.429
MATT: Perception check.

03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:22.960
TRAVIS: And just for clarity,
her resistance lowered my--

03:31:22.960 --> 03:31:24.710
MATT: Yes, we went
over that in the break.

03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:26.460
TALIESIN: Well, $500.

03:31:26.460 --> 03:31:28.020
LAURA: We've rolled a
lot of ones tonight.

03:31:28.020 --> 03:31:30.250
MATT: You've had a lot of ones.

03:31:30.250 --> 03:31:31.979
TALIESIN: That's a 10 perception.

03:31:31.979 --> 03:31:34.063
MATT: Point of order--
remembering your resistance

03:31:34.063 --> 03:31:35.740
to necrotic damage,

03:31:35.740 --> 03:31:37.848
MATT: You would gain
half of the damage

03:31:37.848 --> 03:31:40.390
that you took from Fjord, so
you would have actually resisted

03:31:40.390 --> 03:31:42.030
necrotic, and you you lost 10.

03:31:42.030 --> 03:31:43.001
TRAVIS: 20.

03:31:43.001 --> 03:31:43.960
ASHLEY: I'm getting 20?

03:31:43.960 --> 03:31:44.823
TRAVIS: You get 20
back and I lose 10.

03:31:44.823 --> 03:31:46.490
MATT: We'll say-- that's fine.

03:31:46.490 --> 03:31:48.070
LAURA: Why did you lose 10?

03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:49.870
MATT: She has to
resistance to necrotic,

03:31:49.870 --> 03:31:53.010
So the thing that Fjord was doing
to her earlier would have been reduced.

03:31:53.010 --> 03:31:54.570
ASHLEY: I forgot.

03:31:54.570 --> 03:31:55.580
MATT: It's all good.

03:31:55.580 --> 03:31:56.380
Welcome back.

03:31:56.380 --> 03:31:57.839
ASHLEY: What's
interesting, though,

03:31:57.839 --> 03:31:59.980
is where it says
defenses, and it

03:31:59.980 --> 03:32:04.688
says “resistant to necrotic and
radiant,” which I didn't see.

03:32:04.688 --> 03:32:06.140
(laughter)

03:32:06.140 --> 03:32:06.940
MATT: Welcome back.

03:32:06.940 --> 03:32:07.840
ASHLEY: Thank you.

03:32:07.840 --> 03:32:10.680
LIAM: So we are seeing
these little antechambers?

03:32:10.680 --> 03:32:12.530
TRAVIS: Am I still poisoned?

03:32:12.530 --> 03:32:13.480
MATT: You are.

03:32:13.480 --> 03:32:16.000
TRAVIS: I will do
a Lay on Hands,

03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:17.940
and I will cure
myself of the poison.

03:32:17.940 --> 03:32:20.620
MATT: Okay, you are
no longer poisoned.

03:32:20.620 --> 03:32:23.530
As you reach down, there's
like a dull green glow.

03:32:23.530 --> 03:32:26.050
And where the wound was where
the poison was seeping in,

03:32:26.050 --> 03:32:28.510
you watch as these
tiny green vines

03:32:28.510 --> 03:32:30.460
grow over the wound.

03:32:30.460 --> 03:32:33.900
And you feel the poison slowly dissipate
from your bloodstream.

03:32:33.900 --> 03:32:34.843
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:32:38.405 --> 03:32:40.740
MARISHA: You want to help
me clear these rooms,

03:32:40.740 --> 03:32:41.560
just to make sure?

03:32:41.560 --> 03:32:42.766
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

03:32:42.766 --> 03:32:45.595
MARISHA: Yeah, SWAT style, we'll--

03:32:45.595 --> 03:32:48.450
TRAVIS: Tap, tap, corners.

03:32:48.450 --> 03:32:49.250
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:32:49.250 --> 03:32:51.060
MATT: You go into the
first bed chamber,

03:32:51.060 --> 03:32:54.232
and there's about six beds,
people sleeping in them.

03:32:54.592 --> 03:32:56.410
LAURA: People are
sleeping in them?

03:32:56.410 --> 03:32:57.210
MARISHA: (shushing)

03:32:57.210 --> 03:33:00.163
I turn around.
(whispering) Fucking shh!

03:33:00.163 --> 03:33:03.390
Fucking more cultists are sleeping.

03:33:06.310 --> 03:33:08.035
MATT: Just Ringwraith them?

03:33:08.035 --> 03:33:10.152
TRAVIS: That’s what I was thinking!
Just pillows, right?

03:33:10.152 --> 03:33:10.952
MATT: Yep.

03:33:10.952 --> 03:33:13.432
(laughter)

03:33:16.322 --> 03:33:20.872
(creaking)

03:33:24.125 --> 03:33:25.250
ASHLEY: Are they breathing?

03:33:25.250 --> 03:33:28.501
MARISHA: Is there like
a knot, like a lock?

03:33:28.501 --> 03:33:31.040
MATT: It's just an open doorway;
there's no door.

03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:33.540
TRAVIS: Oh! Forget all the miming, then!
MARISHA: Fuck that!

03:33:33.540 --> 03:33:34.594
MATT: Nope, sorry!

03:33:34.594 --> 03:33:36.622
TRAVIS: (whispering) Hey look,
you want to roll a fucking

03:33:36.622 --> 03:33:38.272
Fireball in here or what?

03:33:38.272 --> 03:33:39.222
ASHLEY: Are they breathing?

03:33:39.222 --> 03:33:41.049
TRAVIS: We don't even
know what they are.

03:33:41.049 --> 03:33:42.096
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:33:42.096 --> 03:33:44.410
TRAVIS: I just want to make
sure they're not like, kids.

03:33:44.410 --> 03:33:46.240
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:33:48.933 --> 03:33:49.733
ASHLEY: 15.

03:33:49.733 --> 03:33:50.533
MATT: 15?

03:33:50.533 --> 03:33:52.700
While they're having this
conversation, you look in,

03:33:52.700 --> 03:33:54.290
and there's no
moving in the body.

03:33:54.290 --> 03:33:56.680
There's no rise
and fall of breath.

03:33:56.680 --> 03:33:59.062
TALIESIN: I'm going
to detect undead.

03:33:59.062 --> 03:34:01.000
MATT: Okay.

03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:02.688
No undead around you.

03:34:02.688 --> 03:34:04.405
LAURA and LIAM: It's just dead.

03:34:04.405 --> 03:34:06.507
MARISHA: Some cult shit, yes.

03:34:06.507 --> 03:34:07.840
A little Kool-Aid.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:09.562
TRAVIS: They're
all wearing Nikes.

03:34:09.562 --> 03:34:11.310
MARISHA: Ooh.

03:34:11.310 --> 03:34:15.280
LAURA: Let's just keep going.

03:34:15.280 --> 03:34:17.830
TRAVIS: Do we need to search
the bodies or anything?

03:34:17.830 --> 03:34:19.747
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
just as we're walking by--

03:34:19.747 --> 03:34:21.490
run Detect Magic
on the four rooms,

03:34:21.490 --> 03:34:23.200
and just see if anything's--

03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:24.420
LAURA: Should we grab their clothes?

03:34:24.420 --> 03:34:25.920
MATT: Nothing catches
your attention

03:34:25.920 --> 03:34:28.087
magically that you aren't
expecting on your persons.

03:34:28.087 --> 03:34:30.540
LAURA: (whispering) Are they
wearing robes of cultists?

03:34:30.540 --> 03:34:31.480
MATT: They are not.

03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:33.030
They're wearing
robes of the Chantry.

03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:35.290
LAURA: Oh.

03:34:35.290 --> 03:34:37.712
MATT: And upon closer inspection,
you can see a bit of foam

03:34:37.712 --> 03:34:38.921
at the corners of some of the mouths.

03:34:38.921 --> 03:34:44.470
It appears that they were
all unknowingly eating

03:34:44.470 --> 03:34:46.920
their last meal,
probably this morning.

03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:49.135
LAURA: That’s really terrible.

03:34:49.135 --> 03:34:51.260
I'm glad we killed that
old lady with the bad hair.

03:34:51.260 --> 03:34:52.192
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:34:52.192 --> 03:34:55.560
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going
to try Divine Intervention.

03:34:55.560 --> 03:34:56.360
MATT: Okay.

03:34:56.360 --> 03:34:59.740
TALIESIN: I'm going to put
a prayer out to see if--

03:34:59.740 --> 03:35:01.970
how specific do I have to be?

03:35:01.970 --> 03:35:04.420
MATT: Just let me know
what the intent of, what

03:35:04.420 --> 03:35:05.980
challenge you want help with.

03:35:05.980 --> 03:35:08.022
TALIESIN: I wish to be better
prepared for the battle

03:35:08.022 --> 03:35:10.184
ahead for all of us.

03:35:12.760 --> 03:35:13.560
TALIESIN: 77.

03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:14.560
MATT: No.

03:35:14.560 --> 03:35:15.420
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:35:15.420 --> 03:35:18.490
MATT: Unfortunately, there's
something about the essence,

03:35:18.490 --> 03:35:24.720
as you draw closer to
whatever is below the Chantry,

03:35:24.720 --> 03:35:29.030
that blocks a clear mode
of communication with the Wildmother.

03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:31.030
TALIESIN: It's a hail Wildmother, you know?

03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:33.840
TRAVIS: My See
Invisibility is still up.

03:35:33.840 --> 03:35:34.840
MATT: Lasts for an hour.

03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:38.110
TRAVIS: Anything in here
going off? In the hallway,

03:35:38.110 --> 03:35:39.250
not in the rooms.

03:35:39.250 --> 03:35:40.510
MATT: No.

03:35:40.510 --> 03:35:41.440
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:35:44.370 --> 03:35:46.552
Shall we?

03:35:46.552 --> 03:35:47.420
LIAM: Yeah.

03:35:47.420 --> 03:35:48.360
LAURA: Yeah.

03:35:48.360 --> 03:35:52.200
TRAVIS: Yasha, do you
mind leading the way?

03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:54.640
ASHLEY: Not at all.

03:35:54.640 --> 03:35:57.080
MATT: Okay.

03:35:57.080 --> 03:36:00.680
You head down the stairway
towards the underground crypt.

03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:06.800
Immediately, a dark,
musty smell comes to you.

03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:10.010
You can see the crypt
stretches before about 80 feet,

03:36:10.010 --> 03:36:12.590
maybe 30, 40 feet wide.

03:36:12.590 --> 03:36:16.820
The smell of damp earth and
incense lingering.

03:36:16.820 --> 03:36:21.030
Old, not anything
recent, necessarily.

03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:23.630
Though the smell
of burning embers

03:36:23.630 --> 03:36:25.820
is still a little prominent.

03:36:25.820 --> 03:36:28.130
You can see that
the walls themselves

03:36:28.130 --> 03:36:31.820
are lined with shelves
of bones and carefully

03:36:31.820 --> 03:36:34.530
interred holy corpses.

03:36:34.530 --> 03:36:41.080
This crypt carries many
bodies, many old, some not.

03:36:41.080 --> 03:36:44.570
Moss and fungus appear to have
gathered at the corners of all

03:36:44.570 --> 03:36:47.720
the smoothed rock,
while about a half dozen

03:36:47.720 --> 03:36:49.340
braziers carry low embers.

03:36:49.340 --> 03:36:52.025
You see four of them
specifically in the room that

03:36:52.025 --> 03:36:54.630
are prominently
placed in the center

03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:56.810
in a square formation around

03:36:56.810 --> 03:37:00.310
a single statue of the Dawnfather

03:37:00.310 --> 03:37:01.310
that sits in the center.

03:37:01.310 --> 03:37:03.320
His head himself a brazier.

03:37:03.320 --> 03:37:05.960
You see the armored body,
and where the head would be,

03:37:05.960 --> 03:37:07.480
it's the lower
half of a brazier.

03:37:07.480 --> 03:37:10.310
In all five of these braziers,
can see ember coals.

03:37:10.310 --> 03:37:12.240
They've been
burning for a while,

03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:14.162
giving off this
dull, orangish glow.

03:37:14.162 --> 03:37:16.371
And that is the only light
source within the chamber.

03:37:20.440 --> 03:37:22.978
There is no discernible exit
beyond the steps you took.

03:37:22.978 --> 03:37:26.160
TRAVIS: Anything invisible in the room?
LIAM: I look around.

03:37:26.160 --> 03:37:27.785
TRAVIS: Anything
invisible in the room?

03:37:27.785 --> 03:37:29.577
MATT: You do not
see anything invisible.

03:37:29.577 --> 03:37:32.540
LIAM: I'm going to start
checking the walls carefully,

03:37:32.540 --> 03:37:34.590
not by touch, but
peering, looking

03:37:34.590 --> 03:37:36.690
for seams or cracks or any--

03:37:36.690 --> 03:37:40.500
MATT: Okay, go ahead and
make a perception check.

03:37:40.500 --> 03:37:43.178
TALIESIN: I'm
going to give you--

03:37:43.178 --> 03:37:44.470
I'm going to give you Guidance.

03:37:48.358 --> 03:37:49.580
LIAM: And that's a d4, yeah?

03:37:49.580 --> 03:37:50.472
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:37:50.472 --> 03:37:52.150
LIAM: Perception,
not investigation?

03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:54.240
MATT: You're just
using your eyes,

03:37:54.240 --> 03:37:56.810
and not feeling along with your
hands and looking for things?

03:37:56.810 --> 03:37:57.990
I'd say it's perception.

03:37:57.990 --> 03:38:01.600
LIAM: Yeah, I'll
do that, so 13--

03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:02.400
17.

03:38:02.400 --> 03:38:03.200
MATT: 17?

03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:06.060
Okay, you take a little while,
and begin to go along the walls.

03:38:06.060 --> 03:38:09.278
You don't see any seams,
don't notice anything hidden.

03:38:09.278 --> 03:38:11.070
You don't know if it's
a fault of your eyes

03:38:11.070 --> 03:38:14.440
or the room just does not contain
what you're looking for.

03:38:14.590 --> 03:38:16.470
ASHLEY: Have I been
this far down yet?

03:38:16.470 --> 03:38:19.840
MATT: You've been in the crypt,
and this is as far as you got.

03:38:19.840 --> 03:38:22.200
You just had arrived in the crypt,

03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:24.840
and that was when the
(thud) happened,

03:38:24.840 --> 03:38:27.532
and you were all summoned
back up to the cathedral,

03:38:27.532 --> 03:38:28.741
where the encounter occurred.

03:38:28.741 --> 03:38:31.980
LIAM: Well, Caduceus or I could
make it a lot brighter in here

03:38:31.980 --> 03:38:33.090
if we wanted.

03:38:33.090 --> 03:38:34.371
TALIESIN: I can do that.

03:38:34.371 --> 03:38:37.592
MARISHA: I think
we're fine, do it.

03:38:37.592 --> 03:38:39.900
MATT: Light spell lights up the chamber.

03:38:39.900 --> 03:38:42.386
SAM: I'm waiting right there, ah!

03:38:42.386 --> 03:38:44.090
(laughter)

03:38:44.090 --> 03:38:47.640
MATT: The chamber is brighter,
but it doesn't reveal anything.

03:38:47.640 --> 03:38:49.440
MARISHA: Do I see any signs?

03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:53.220
I start looking behind
the crypts and in crevices,

03:38:53.220 --> 03:38:57.570
looking for the pieces
of the portal device,

03:38:57.570 --> 03:38:59.730
or if there's
anything that looks

03:38:59.730 --> 03:39:01.660
reminiscent of that hidden.

03:39:01.660 --> 03:39:02.640
Any hidden shit.

03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:03.890
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:39:03.890 --> 03:39:06.990
MARISHA: Or any stashed shit in general.

03:39:06.990 --> 03:39:08.450
Perception?

03:39:08.450 --> 03:39:10.220
LAURA: Or investigation?

03:39:10.220 --> 03:39:11.460
MATT: Well, if you're--

03:39:11.460 --> 03:39:13.395
MARISHA: Investigation.

03:39:13.395 --> 03:39:18.400
MATT: If you're looking specifically for a
device, or inspecting for a--

03:39:18.825 --> 03:39:21.195
MARISHA: Yeah, hands and knees,
and the nook and crannies.

03:39:21.195 --> 03:39:23.405
MATT: Okay, you're going deep in?
Make it an investigation, then.

03:39:23.405 --> 03:39:25.113
It'll take you a little bit.
MARISHA: 18.

03:39:25.113 --> 03:39:26.080
MATT: 18?

03:39:26.080 --> 03:39:28.190
MARISHA: Still not
great, but yeah.

03:39:28.190 --> 03:39:30.450
MATT: Okay.

03:39:30.450 --> 03:39:33.060
You do not find anything
that resembles the device.

03:39:33.060 --> 03:39:36.600
You don't see any sign of
metal, or the shape of it.

03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:38.870
Though you did see
it in the scrying

03:39:38.870 --> 03:39:42.180
that was handed over to Respa.

03:39:42.180 --> 03:39:44.250
You do not know where
it's been installed.

03:39:44.250 --> 03:39:47.490
You do know that the creatures
that seemed to be fighting

03:39:47.490 --> 03:39:50.350
were in the towers, or
somewhere in that region.

03:39:50.350 --> 03:39:52.247
LAURA: Oh, it's
probably up there still.

03:39:52.247 --> 03:39:53.135
TRAVIS: Two of them.

03:39:53.135 --> 03:39:54.780
LAURA: Yeah, I bet
they're coming out.

03:39:54.780 --> 03:39:56.030
That's why they kept spawning.

03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:57.158
MARISHA: Kept coming.

03:39:57.158 --> 03:39:59.450
ASHLEY: Could you tell me
the layout of the room again?

03:39:59.450 --> 03:40:02.484
MATT: I'll show it to you.

03:40:02.484 --> 03:40:04.730
SAM: Oh, we're
showing something?

03:40:04.730 --> 03:40:07.790
Dwarven Forge

03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:11.330
will be at PAX Unplugged for
the first weekend in September.

03:40:11.330 --> 03:40:15.730
Go say hi at the
Die Hard Dice booth.

03:40:15.730 --> 03:40:18.946
And follow on social,
@dwarvenforge on Twitter.

03:40:18.946 --> 03:40:20.760
TRAVIS: Wow!
LAURA: Oh shit!

03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:23.856
MATT: So that is the
general layout of the crypt.

03:40:23.856 --> 03:40:26.190
MARISHA: Look at the skulls
on the outside of the walls.

03:40:26.190 --> 03:40:26.990
That's sick.

03:40:26.990 --> 03:40:29.026
ASHLEY: That's fucking cool.

03:40:29.026 --> 03:40:29.990
SAM: Look at the skulls!

03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:31.440
TRAVIS: Can we
just have a moment

03:40:31.440 --> 03:40:32.760
for how built that map is?

03:40:32.760 --> 03:40:33.776
LAURA: And the Dawnfather is--

03:40:33.776 --> 03:40:35.600
MATT: The statue in the
center that raises.

03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:36.808
It's this large statue.

03:40:36.808 --> 03:40:38.620
LAURA: And you the
brazier is the head?

03:40:38.620 --> 03:40:40.037
MATT: His head is
a brazier, yeah.

03:40:40.037 --> 03:40:41.704
TRAVIS: Like Mysterio
instead of a bowl.

03:40:41.704 --> 03:40:43.770
MATT: These are the four
braziers on the edge.

03:40:43.770 --> 03:40:46.530
Each of these is
a stone tomb that sits

03:40:46.530 --> 03:40:48.630
in the middle of the chamber.

03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:50.300
TALIESIN: What's
in the braziers?

03:40:50.300 --> 03:40:51.592
MATT: There's burning coals.

03:40:51.592 --> 03:40:53.551
TALIESIN: Okay, so there
is fire in the braziers.

03:40:53.551 --> 03:40:55.363
LAURA: Is there light
actually coming?

03:40:55.363 --> 03:40:56.280
MATT: They're burning.

03:40:56.280 --> 03:40:58.613
There's embers in there that
are glowing orange.

03:40:58.613 --> 03:41:00.363
LAURA: Can I climb up
and look in the head

03:41:00.363 --> 03:41:02.340
and see what's in that one?

03:41:02.340 --> 03:41:05.720
MATT: Sure. You climb up.

03:41:05.720 --> 03:41:06.720
It's not too hard to do.

03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:08.137
You find a place
to look up there.

03:41:08.137 --> 03:41:10.270
It's similar to
the other braziers.

03:41:10.270 --> 03:41:12.810
Looks like some low
coals that are burning,

03:41:12.810 --> 03:41:14.307
some burned thatch and things.

03:41:14.307 --> 03:41:16.891
LIAM: I'm going going to start
checking out all of these tombs

03:41:16.891 --> 03:41:18.380
to see if--

03:41:18.380 --> 03:41:19.735
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll help you.

03:41:19.735 --> 03:41:21.953
LIAM: I'm going
to look for traps.

03:41:21.953 --> 03:41:23.370
But I think maybe
there are stairs

03:41:23.370 --> 03:41:24.690
or a passage in one of them.

03:41:24.690 --> 03:41:27.270
TALIESIN: I'm going to use
Thaumaturgy to get the fires

03:41:27.270 --> 03:41:28.510
going a little hotter again.

03:41:28.510 --> 03:41:29.594
Going to make the lights--

03:41:29.594 --> 03:41:30.767
LAURA: Ow, shit!

03:41:30.767 --> 03:41:32.071
MATT: Yeah, you pull back a little bit.
TALIESIN: Sorry.

03:41:32.085 --> 03:41:34.284
MATT: The fires burn
a little brighter,

03:41:34.284 --> 03:41:35.701
the room lightens
a little bit all

03:41:35.701 --> 03:41:39.338
around from all the
small, low-burning fires

03:41:39.338 --> 03:41:40.380
now getting more intense.

03:41:40.380 --> 03:41:42.714
TRAVIS: The corners of the
room-- are those candles that

03:41:42.714 --> 03:41:44.963
are set up in sort of like--

03:41:44.963 --> 03:41:46.380
MATT: Oh, the
corners of the room?

03:41:46.380 --> 03:41:49.780
Those are small areas where
it looks like offerings

03:41:49.780 --> 03:41:51.090
would be left behind.

03:41:51.090 --> 03:41:55.740
You can see bowls and
plates that contain

03:41:55.740 --> 03:41:59.190
coins, old knick knacks,
pieces of jewelry

03:41:59.190 --> 03:42:01.800
that were either
left as a prayer

03:42:01.800 --> 03:42:03.400
or part of a burying rite.

03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:07.130
LAURA: Can I inspect this
statue and see if it twists,

03:42:07.130 --> 03:42:09.578
or if there's any things on
it that move or anything?

03:42:09.578 --> 03:42:10.811
MATT: Sure, make
an investigation check.

03:42:10.811 --> 03:42:12.029
TALIESIN: I'll also
say technically,

03:42:12.029 --> 03:42:13.890
I think my Detect Magic
would still have been--

03:42:13.890 --> 03:42:14.690
LAURA: Guidance!

03:42:14.690 --> 03:42:18.800
TALIESIN: -- within 10 minutes of
us leaving those four chambers.

03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:21.670
Is it within 10 minutes?

03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:23.970
LAURA: 17 plus three is 20.

03:42:23.970 --> 03:42:26.710
MATT: For this, I would say it does not.
It doesn’t pick up anything.

03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:28.012
LAURA: 21.

03:42:28.012 --> 03:42:29.520
MATT: 21, okay.

03:42:29.520 --> 03:42:30.630
Looking at the statue--

03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:32.089
the brazier head or
anything around it.

03:42:32.089 --> 03:42:35.980
Nothing about this statue seems
to move or shift or anything.

03:42:35.980 --> 03:42:40.560
The Dawnfather structure
is a solid piece of stone.

03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:42.810
LIAM: And said I had wanted
to investigate tombs,

03:42:42.810 --> 03:42:45.025
see if there are any triggers?

03:42:45.025 --> 03:42:45.825
MATT: Right.

03:42:45.825 --> 03:42:47.858
LIAM: Steps or
ladders inside them?

03:42:47.858 --> 03:42:49.250
MATT: And you rolled?
TRAVIS: I will assist you.

03:42:49.250 --> 03:42:51.282
LIAM: I was waiting for
you to tell me what to do.

03:42:51.282 --> 03:42:52.012
MATT: Okay, sorry.

03:42:52.012 --> 03:42:54.095
So that would be an
investigation for both of you.

03:42:54.095 --> 03:42:59.200
LAURA: I'm going to paint on
the brazier, just like a half

03:42:59.200 --> 03:43:01.340
of a face, and then
like a little speech

03:43:01.340 --> 03:43:04.070
bubble coming out that says,
"Oh god, my head!

03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:05.581
"Oh, my head!"

03:43:05.581 --> 03:43:07.305
(laughter)

03:43:07.305 --> 03:43:09.560
MATT: It would be
Jester to deface

03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:12.745
a very holy relic at the bottom
of the Chantry at this moment.

03:43:12.745 --> 03:43:13.545
I love it.

03:43:13.545 --> 03:43:14.565
LIAM: 22.

03:43:14.565 --> 03:43:16.220
MATT: 22.

03:43:16.220 --> 03:43:19.970
You go through them one by
one, and as you feel around,

03:43:19.970 --> 03:43:21.830
they're all pretty solid.

03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:27.980
You lift and look inside, and
there are old, old bodies that

03:43:27.980 --> 03:43:31.418
are interred carefully,
wrapped in ornamental robes,

03:43:31.418 --> 03:43:33.460
some of which that have
just slowly deteriorated.

03:43:33.460 --> 03:43:35.720
They've probably been
there a hundred years,

03:43:35.720 --> 03:43:39.567
maybe 200, as long as
Rexxentrum has been.

03:43:39.567 --> 03:43:41.901
A few of them are little more
fresh, but all six of them

03:43:41.901 --> 03:43:46.010
seem to carry corpses,
and no signs of being

03:43:46.010 --> 03:43:47.952
able to descend within them.

03:43:47.952 --> 03:43:50.145
LIAM: Anything
interesting on the bodies?

03:43:50.145 --> 03:43:52.020
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, can I
touch each one of them

03:43:52.020 --> 03:43:54.050
and make sure my hand
doesn't pass through them?

03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:56.080
MATT: Sure.

03:43:56.080 --> 03:43:59.528
One by one, you begin
to press the bodies.

03:43:59.528 --> 03:44:01.070
And they
rock back and forth,

03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:03.170
and dust falls
from them and crumbles.

03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:06.686
And you eliminate all of them
as possibly being illusions,

03:44:06.686 --> 03:44:08.270
and your fingers
smell a little funny.

03:44:08.270 --> 03:44:09.187
TRAVIS: They're all real.

03:44:09.187 --> 03:44:10.214
TALIESIN: I know.

03:44:10.214 --> 03:44:12.896
(laughter)

03:44:12.896 --> 03:44:17.555
ASHLEY: Can I go search
the base of the--

03:44:17.555 --> 03:44:19.180
MARISHA: You're soaked
in blood anyway.

03:44:19.180 --> 03:44:20.222
ASHLEY: -- the Dawnfather?

03:44:20.222 --> 03:44:21.254
MATT: Sure.

03:44:21.254 --> 03:44:22.975
You make an investigation.

03:44:22.975 --> 03:44:26.270
LAURA: As she gets there,
I am starting to kneel down

03:44:26.270 --> 03:44:28.726
and pray to the Traveler
in front of the shrine

03:44:28.726 --> 03:44:29.560
I just made for him.

03:44:29.560 --> 03:44:30.360
ASHLEY: 21.

03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:32.030
MATT: 21?

03:44:32.030 --> 03:44:37.650
You get down to it, and you
can see towards the back of it,

03:44:37.650 --> 03:44:40.380
there's a general layer of dust
that's settled in this ground.

03:44:40.380 --> 03:44:42.220
Some of it's kicked
up from feet,

03:44:42.220 --> 03:44:44.780
steps and movement, especially
you guys moving around.

03:44:44.780 --> 03:44:47.100
There are two--
there's an element

03:44:47.100 --> 03:44:48.680
like a square on
the back side of it

03:44:48.680 --> 03:44:50.180
were the dust's
been pushed aside.

03:44:53.600 --> 03:44:55.280
ASHLEY: I'm going
to try to push it.

03:44:55.280 --> 03:44:57.110
MATT: Okay, make a strength check.

03:44:57.110 --> 03:45:00.251
TRAVIS: Let’s go, Beast Mode.

03:45:00.251 --> 03:45:03.260
LAURA: Can I give her advantage?

03:45:03.260 --> 03:45:05.540
Can I help her out, since
I'm sitting right there?

03:45:05.540 --> 03:45:06.690
MATT: Sure.
ASHLEY: 26.

03:45:06.690 --> 03:45:08.488
LAURA: Oh well, do
you even need it?

03:45:08.488 --> 03:45:09.530
I can give you advantage.

03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:10.330
Try it again.

03:45:12.824 --> 03:45:14.380
ASHLEY: This dice, man.

03:45:16.866 --> 03:45:17.666
26.

03:45:17.666 --> 03:45:19.700
MATT: 26.

03:45:19.700 --> 03:45:22.584
You both get behind
it and push, and push.

03:45:22.584 --> 03:45:23.384
Nothing.

03:45:23.384 --> 03:45:24.184
TRAVIS: Wow!

03:45:24.184 --> 03:45:26.190
LAURA: There's a
button or something.

03:45:26.190 --> 03:45:26.990
There's got to be.

03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:29.146
TALIESIN: Do any of
these skulls or bodies

03:45:29.146 --> 03:45:31.480
look like they're a different
age than the rest of them?

03:45:31.480 --> 03:45:33.062
MATT: Yeah, the age
varies tremendously.

03:45:33.062 --> 03:45:34.520
Some of them hundreds
of years old.

03:45:34.520 --> 03:45:36.228
Some of them are a
couple of decades old.

03:45:36.228 --> 03:45:38.436
Some of them look maybe
within the past couple years.

03:45:38.436 --> 03:45:40.370
TALIESIN: One more detect
undead just for fun.

03:45:40.370 --> 03:45:43.101
MATT: Okay. None.
TRAVIS: Is there petroleum on the floor?

03:45:43.101 --> 03:45:45.134
TALIESIN: Nothing?

03:45:45.134 --> 03:45:47.060
MATT: This is a cathedral
of the Dawnfather,

03:45:47.060 --> 03:45:50.030
who is one of the many
entities that despises undeath.

03:45:50.030 --> 03:45:52.850
And much of this area
is hallowed specifically

03:45:52.850 --> 03:45:54.710
to prevent anything from rising.

03:45:54.710 --> 03:45:57.170
MARISHA: I'm going to
start-- hearing Jester

03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:59.728
say there's got to be a button.

03:45:59.728 --> 03:46:02.250
You all are messing
with the statue, right? For clarity.

03:46:02.250 --> 03:46:04.713
LAURA: Yeah, it didn't work, so
I'm going to kneel down and try

03:46:04.713 --> 03:46:05.963
to pray to the Traveler again.

03:46:05.963 --> 03:46:07.630
MARISHA: I'm going
to go around, and I'm

03:46:07.630 --> 03:46:12.410
going to go up to these skulls
and bodies in the walls,

03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:16.820
and just start,
like, jiggling them.

03:46:16.820 --> 03:46:17.800
MATT: Okay.

03:46:17.800 --> 03:46:20.400
MARISHA: Just seeing.

03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:21.900
Pull a femur, see what happens.

03:46:21.900 --> 03:46:22.700
MATT: Okay.

03:46:22.700 --> 03:46:23.700
So you begin doing that.

03:46:23.700 --> 03:46:25.220
It's going to take
a little while.

03:46:25.220 --> 03:46:26.845
LIAM: I'm going to
begin ritual casting

03:46:26.845 --> 03:46:29.160
Detect Magic too, since
everybody is trying everything.

03:46:29.160 --> 03:46:30.380
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Maybe it won't.

03:46:30.380 --> 03:46:31.880
MATT: Okay, while
they're doing that--

03:46:31.880 --> 03:46:33.547
MARISHA: Do an investigation check

03:46:33.547 --> 03:46:35.046
to see if I can notice the one?

03:46:35.046 --> 03:46:36.130
MATT: Yeah, I'll allow it.

03:46:36.130 --> 03:46:36.930
MARISHA: Okay.

03:46:39.416 --> 03:46:42.800
LAURA: I'm going to
try and do Divine

03:46:42.800 --> 03:46:45.460
Intervention with the
Traveler while I'm here.

03:46:45.460 --> 03:46:46.260
TRAVIS: Yes sir.

03:46:46.260 --> 03:46:48.000
MARISHA: Yay!

03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:49.922
25.

03:46:49.922 --> 03:46:51.200
MATT: 25?

03:46:51.200 --> 03:46:52.000
Okay, cool.

03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:53.250
We'll get to that in a second.

03:46:53.250 --> 03:46:54.516
This will take a little while.

03:46:54.516 --> 03:46:58.100
LAURA: I'm going to
ask him to protect

03:46:58.100 --> 03:47:03.920
us when we get down to Obann,
to keep us from being turned.

03:47:03.920 --> 03:47:05.790
Please keep anybody
from being turned.

03:47:05.790 --> 03:47:07.104
MATT: Okay.

03:47:07.104 --> 03:47:11.138
Go ahead and roll for
divine intervention.

03:47:11.138 --> 03:47:13.413
LAURA: Where's my percentile?

03:47:15.356 --> 03:47:16.440
Do I roll two percentiles?

03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:17.990
TALIESIN: One
percentile and one non.

03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:21.766
MATT: A d10 and then
a percentile one.

03:47:21.766 --> 03:47:23.035
LAURA: 22.

03:47:23.035 --> 03:47:25.160
MATT: 22?

03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:29.030
While his presence is felt,
you gather that the protection

03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:31.190
he provides is already present.

03:47:31.190 --> 03:47:34.430
LAURA: Understandable.
He’s already close by.

03:47:34.430 --> 03:47:36.286
TRAVIS: (singing)
Understandable.

03:47:36.286 --> 03:47:38.710
(laughter)

03:47:38.710 --> 03:47:41.112
MARISHA: (singing) Comprehensible!

03:47:41.112 --> 03:47:43.071
ASHLEY: Jester, can you
help me with something?

03:47:43.071 --> 03:47:45.695
LAURA: Yeah, what do you need?

03:47:45.695 --> 03:47:47.450
ASHLEY: This is really
stupid, but I don't know.

03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:49.953
It might be something.
I wonder if we can try turning--

03:47:49.953 --> 03:47:51.170
LAURA: The whole statue?
ASHLEY: --the statue.

03:47:51.170 --> 03:47:53.520
LAURA: I know, I was trying to do it,
but maybe with two of us.

03:47:53.551 --> 03:47:54.843
ASHLEY: You tried?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:47:54.843 --> 03:47:56.843
I'll grab from one side,
and you grab the other.

03:47:56.843 --> 03:47:58.468
TALIESIN: I'm going
to add some-- well,

03:47:58.468 --> 03:48:00.287
Guidance actually isn't going
to help with this, is it?

03:48:00.287 --> 03:48:01.370
No.
LAURA: Probably not.

03:48:01.370 --> 03:48:02.170
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:48:02.170 --> 03:48:02.970
LAURA: (grunting)

03:48:02.970 --> 03:48:05.042
MATT: Make a strength check.
LAURA: Should each of us do it?

03:48:05.042 --> 03:48:06.250
MATT: Each of you guys do it.

03:48:06.250 --> 03:48:07.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's
not an ability.

03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:08.550
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

03:48:08.550 --> 03:48:09.592
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind.

03:48:09.592 --> 03:48:10.740
MATT: Which is a total of--

03:48:10.740 --> 03:48:12.520
ASHLEY: Which is a total of 28.

03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:13.980
MATT: 28?

03:48:13.980 --> 03:48:15.350
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm sorry.

03:48:15.350 --> 03:48:16.260
Not a 28.

03:48:16.260 --> 03:48:18.320
I'm sorry, a 23.

03:48:18.320 --> 03:48:20.428
LAURA: I rolled a nine.

03:48:23.225 --> 03:48:25.050
MATT: All right.

03:48:25.050 --> 03:48:27.725
So you guys push and push
and push and push and push.

03:48:27.725 --> 03:48:28.525
LAURA: It's nothing.

03:48:28.525 --> 03:48:29.372
It's not moving.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

03:48:29.372 --> 03:48:31.486
LAURA: It's not a thing.
TRAVIS: Caduceus, can you--

03:48:31.486 --> 03:48:33.492
LAURA: With a natural 20.
I know, it looks like it would.

03:48:33.492 --> 03:48:35.587
TRAVIS: Can you
extinguish the flame?

03:48:35.587 --> 03:48:37.295
TALIESIN: Sure.

03:48:37.295 --> 03:48:38.356
Thaumaturgy.

03:48:38.356 --> 03:48:40.750
MATT: (whooshing) All
the braziers go out.

03:48:40.750 --> 03:48:41.736
MARISHA: Ah!

03:48:41.736 --> 03:48:43.387
MATT: You have your
goggles on still, though.

03:48:43.387 --> 03:48:45.400
TALIESIN: The light's still up, because I haven't
turned off my Light spell.

03:48:45.400 --> 03:48:46.433
MATT: That's true,
the light's still up.

03:48:46.433 --> 03:48:48.409
LIAM: I am trying to work here!
Where'd the light go?

03:48:48.409 --> 03:48:49.292
TALIESIN: The light's still up.

03:48:49.292 --> 03:48:50.130
MATT: He still has
his Light spell,

03:48:50.130 --> 03:48:51.310
but all the braziers go out.

03:48:51.310 --> 03:48:53.269
TALIESIN: The temperature
of the light's changed.

03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:54.450
MATT: Correct.

03:48:54.450 --> 03:48:56.788
You now at this point have gone
around the room, pulled all

03:48:56.788 --> 03:48:57.900
sorts of things, looked for it.

03:48:57.900 --> 03:48:59.517
And you feel pretty
confident that you've

03:48:59.517 --> 03:49:00.457
done a pretty valid sweep.

03:49:00.457 --> 03:49:02.640
There's nothing in the walls,
nothing in the corpses, under the bones.

03:49:03.440 --> 03:49:05.370
You've disturbed
a lot of the dead,

03:49:05.370 --> 03:49:07.370
and there's been no sign of--

03:49:07.370 --> 03:49:09.120
TRAVIS: They're dead,
they'll get over it.

03:49:09.120 --> 03:49:10.890
MARISHA: Oh, what
are we missing?

03:49:10.890 --> 03:49:12.123
LIAM: You've come
down here with them?

03:49:12.123 --> 03:49:13.838
ASHLEY: Yeah, we came
down here, but we didn't

03:49:13.838 --> 03:49:15.130
go further than this, because--

03:49:15.130 --> 03:49:16.964
LIAM: What did you do
when you were in here?

03:49:16.964 --> 03:49:18.210
TALIESIN: Anything.

03:49:18.210 --> 03:49:20.850
MATT: Obann began
reading the scrolls that

03:49:20.850 --> 03:49:23.250
were handed to him by Respa.

03:49:23.250 --> 03:49:26.375
And while he was in
the process of doing so

03:49:26.375 --> 03:49:27.750
was when you guys
were called up.

03:49:27.750 --> 03:49:30.120
So you're not certain.

03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:32.040
As part of your
investigation 25,

03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:38.130
I will say you do notice that
the brazier on the back left

03:49:38.130 --> 03:49:40.800
that's at the foot
on that side,

03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:44.970
there is a faint bit
of ash and charcoal

03:49:44.970 --> 03:49:47.670
on the ground around
it, like a little ring

03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:51.380
that is more prominent
than the other braziers.

03:49:51.380 --> 03:49:52.650
MARISHA: Hang on.

03:49:52.650 --> 03:49:53.520
Hang on.

03:49:55.933 --> 03:49:57.350
TRAVIS: Are you going to pass out?

03:49:57.350 --> 03:49:58.450
MARISHA: Caduceus?

03:49:58.450 --> 03:50:00.568
TALIESIN: Yeah?

03:50:00.568 --> 03:50:04.230
MARISHA: What do
you make of this?

03:50:04.230 --> 03:50:07.040
TALIESIN: What do
I make of that?

03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:10.520
MATT: There's some of the ash.

03:50:10.520 --> 03:50:12.840
TALIESIN: Does it seem
intentional, or is this--

03:50:12.840 --> 03:50:14.328
MATT: It looks like
stuff that would fall

03:50:14.328 --> 03:50:15.620
out of a brazier on the ground.

03:50:15.620 --> 03:50:17.120
LAURA: Maybe try
moving the brazier.

03:50:17.120 --> 03:50:20.841
MARISHA: I'm going
to shift it or--

03:50:20.841 --> 03:50:21.800
MATT: It doesn't shift.

03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:22.675
It's locked in place.

03:50:22.675 --> 03:50:25.760
MARISHA: Do I
feel any mechanisms?

03:50:25.760 --> 03:50:26.560
Groping a brazier.

03:50:26.560 --> 03:50:28.810
MATT: Make investigation
check, if you want.

03:50:28.810 --> 03:50:30.950
TALIESIN: I'm going to
give you a d4 for that.

03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:32.510
Since you seem to be doing a thing.

03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:34.631
MARISHA: Two.

03:50:34.631 --> 03:50:37.970
Oh, why is it always
such a journey?

03:50:37.970 --> 03:50:40.930
It's not great.

03:50:40.930 --> 03:50:41.780
19.

03:50:41.780 --> 03:50:44.095
MATT: 19?

03:50:44.095 --> 03:50:45.019
It doesn't move.

03:50:45.019 --> 03:50:46.478
The brazier is
solid to the ground.

03:50:46.478 --> 03:50:48.200
It's not a bowl
that's on pillars.

03:50:48.200 --> 03:50:51.290
It's a solid stone pillar
that has an interior part that

03:50:51.290 --> 03:50:52.850
has some openings
in the side, where

03:50:52.850 --> 03:50:55.433
it keeps everything in,
where the flames can come out.

03:50:55.433 --> 03:50:57.766
And there's just a little bit
of a ring of sprinkled ash

03:50:57.766 --> 03:50:59.583
and charcoal on the
ground around it.

03:50:59.583 --> 03:51:00.383
But the others do not.

03:51:00.383 --> 03:51:01.957
TRAVIS: Are the flames
extinguished now?

03:51:01.957 --> 03:51:03.301
MATT: The flames
are extinguished.

03:51:03.301 --> 03:51:05.587
MARISHA: Can you give it a
big, big boost, light her up?

03:51:05.587 --> 03:51:07.598
TALIESIN: I need somebody
to actually light it up.

03:51:07.598 --> 03:51:08.398
MARISHA: Caleb!

03:51:08.398 --> 03:51:09.573
TALIESIN: Can I do that?
LIAM: Yeah?

03:51:09.573 --> 03:51:11.240
LAURA: I wonder if
something's got to be

03:51:11.240 --> 03:51:12.510
burned around it or something.

03:51:12.510 --> 03:51:13.885
TRAVIS: Can I take
a copper piece

03:51:13.885 --> 03:51:15.510
and throw it in the brazer?
MATT: Yeah.

03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:17.266
It lands in the brazer.

03:51:17.266 --> 03:51:20.675
MARISHA: Maybe-- I don't know.

03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:24.860
Throw a Fire Bolt at
this thing or something?

03:51:24.860 --> 03:51:27.010
TALIESIN: I mean,
we can just do--

03:51:27.010 --> 03:51:28.020
I think I have matches.

03:51:28.020 --> 03:51:29.200
I'm just going to--

03:51:29.200 --> 03:51:30.000
SAM: Hey!

03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:31.042
MARISHA: What did you do?

03:51:31.042 --> 03:51:31.948
TALIESIN: I used a match.

03:51:31.948 --> 03:51:34.447
MATT: It slowly begins to take.
TALIESIN: And Thaumaturgy.

03:51:34.447 --> 03:51:36.030
MATT: All right, and
you ignite again.

03:51:36.030 --> 03:51:38.618
The brazier is now glowing.

03:51:38.618 --> 03:51:41.036
TALIESIN: There you go.

03:51:41.036 --> 03:51:43.968
LAURA: Anything?

03:51:43.968 --> 03:51:46.010
MATT: There's nowhere to
look underneath, really.

03:51:46.010 --> 03:51:46.880
It's solid.

03:51:46.880 --> 03:51:50.450
TALIESIN: Is the thing
itself stuck in the--

03:51:50.450 --> 03:51:51.776
is it a lazy Susan?

03:51:51.776 --> 03:51:52.860
LAURA: No, it's like a--

03:51:52.860 --> 03:51:54.110
TALIESIN: That's a weird word.

03:51:54.110 --> 03:51:55.108
MARISHA: The bowl--

03:51:55.108 --> 03:51:56.158
ASHLEY: What is the--

03:51:56.158 --> 03:51:58.200
so it just looks like ash
that's around the bowl?

03:51:58.200 --> 03:52:00.250
LAURA: Yeah, what
is the ash made of?

03:52:00.250 --> 03:52:02.283
TALIESIN: It's a circle in
front of it, not around it.

03:52:02.283 --> 03:52:03.390
MATT: No, around it.
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:52:03.390 --> 03:52:04.390
MARISHA: Like it poofed.

03:52:04.390 --> 03:52:05.804
MATT: Like it came out.

03:52:05.804 --> 03:52:07.912
MARISHA: Like it's like
water, like it overflowed.

03:52:07.912 --> 03:52:09.120
ASHLEY: Only around that one?

03:52:09.120 --> 03:52:10.079
MARISHA: It overflowed.

03:52:10.079 --> 03:52:11.442
MATT: Only around that one.

03:52:11.442 --> 03:52:15.380
LAURA: Is there more ash in the
brazier than the other ones?

03:52:17.880 --> 03:52:19.880
MATT: It looks like the
ash that's on the ground

03:52:19.880 --> 03:52:21.936
was displaced, so there's
maybe a little bit less

03:52:21.936 --> 03:52:23.800
for the amount that's now
around it on the ground.

03:52:23.800 --> 03:52:25.691
LAURA: Something came up
from the bottom, maybe?

03:52:25.691 --> 03:52:27.452
LIAM: Would you imagine
10 minutes have gone by?

03:52:27.452 --> 03:52:29.475
LAURA: Can I reach my
hand down into the brazer?

03:52:29.475 --> 03:52:30.350
Is it still embery-y?

03:52:30.350 --> 03:52:31.410
MATT: About now.

03:52:31.410 --> 03:52:33.120
And you detect no magic.
LIAM: Okay.

03:52:33.120 --> 03:52:33.920
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:52:33.920 --> 03:52:35.098
LAURA: Is it still ember-y?

03:52:35.098 --> 03:52:35.898
Is it still hot in there?

03:52:35.898 --> 03:52:37.270
MATT: It is now,
because he lit it.

03:52:37.270 --> 03:52:38.070
LAURA: Oh.

03:52:38.070 --> 03:52:38.873
Unlight it.

03:52:38.873 --> 03:52:39.871
TALIESIN: I'll bring it all.

03:52:39.871 --> 03:52:42.090
I'm not going to quite kill
it, but I'm going to really--

03:52:42.090 --> 03:52:44.106
MATT: Really low, okay.

03:52:44.106 --> 03:52:45.440
LAURA: Does anybody got a stick?

03:52:45.440 --> 03:52:46.787
Somebody give me
something sticky?

03:52:46.787 --> 03:52:47.870
TRAVIS: You can use my sword.

03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:48.670
LAURA: Yeah.

03:52:48.670 --> 03:52:50.045
I stick it in and
move it around,

03:52:50.045 --> 03:52:51.337
see if there's a hole at the--

03:52:51.337 --> 03:52:52.206
SAM: Ah!

03:52:52.206 --> 03:52:55.657
(laughter)

03:52:55.657 --> 03:52:57.260
MATT: You do feel
a bottom, and it's

03:52:57.260 --> 03:52:58.666
about two and a half feet down.

03:52:58.666 --> 03:53:00.250
It's not the whole
base of the pillar.

03:53:00.250 --> 03:53:02.220
The brazier itself is
up about two and a half,

03:53:02.220 --> 03:53:03.020
three feet or so.

03:53:03.020 --> 03:53:05.000
It's about a little
above your waist,

03:53:05.000 --> 03:53:06.630
or about your waist height.

03:53:06.630 --> 03:53:08.300
And it goes down about
a foot and a half

03:53:08.300 --> 03:53:09.870
and hits the bottom--
tink -- and you

03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:11.180
rustle it around inside.

03:53:15.303 --> 03:53:16.470
Make an investigation check.

03:53:19.180 --> 03:53:21.900
TALIESIN: d4.

03:53:21.900 --> 03:53:25.080
SAM: Nice. Nice.

03:53:25.380 --> 03:53:26.180
Super nice.

03:53:26.180 --> 03:53:27.502
LAURA: 15, 16.
MATT: 16?

03:53:27.502 --> 03:53:28.302
Okay.

03:53:28.302 --> 03:53:30.093
LAURA: My investigation's
low, but--

03:53:30.093 --> 03:53:31.510
MATT: You move it
around in there.

03:53:31.510 --> 03:53:34.585
You move some of the
charcoal around with the sword,

03:53:34.585 --> 03:53:35.385
pull it out.

03:53:35.385 --> 03:53:36.980
LAURA: It feels like a brazier.

03:53:36.980 --> 03:53:38.980
I don't know like a brazier
normally feels like.

03:53:38.980 --> 03:53:39.980
Sorry I fucked up your--

03:53:39.980 --> 03:53:41.480
TRAVIS: Start
scooping the ash out.

03:53:41.480 --> 03:53:43.530
LAURA: Well, it's going
to hurt our hands, but--

03:53:43.530 --> 03:53:45.530
ASHLEY: I'll start going
over and start dumping.

03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:47.630
MATT: Okay, it's it's still--

03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:50.840
even when he took the flame
out, it's still a little warm.

03:53:50.840 --> 03:53:53.410
I'll say in the
process of doing so,

03:53:53.410 --> 03:53:56.072
you take two points
of fire damage.

03:53:56.072 --> 03:54:00.185
But you empty out
the brazier, all the ash.

03:54:00.185 --> 03:54:03.728
MARISHA: You could use
the end my bo staff to--

03:54:03.728 --> 03:54:05.270
TALIESIN: I'm going
to start emptying

03:54:05.270 --> 03:54:06.540
out the other ones, too.

03:54:06.540 --> 03:54:08.430
Here, I got a tiny shovel.

03:54:08.430 --> 03:54:09.430
I'll use my tiny shovel.

03:54:09.430 --> 03:54:11.563
LIAM: We're just desecrating
the shit out of this place.

03:54:11.563 --> 03:54:13.433
MATT: As you guys are going
to empty the other ones,

03:54:13.433 --> 03:54:15.245
you get down to the very,
very bottom of this,

03:54:15.245 --> 03:54:18.000
and at the very bottom, there is
a lever about that long-- about

03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:18.800
two inches long.

03:54:18.800 --> 03:54:20.445
(gasping)

03:54:20.445 --> 03:54:22.870
TALIESIN: In any
of the other ones?

03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:23.753
MATT: No, just that one.

03:54:23.753 --> 03:54:25.545
MARISHA: (singing)
That's fucking teamwork.

03:54:25.545 --> 03:54:26.840
Ka-chink.
TRAVIS: That did it?

03:54:26.840 --> 03:54:27.757
MATT: It doesn't move.

03:54:27.757 --> 03:54:28.670
MARISHA: What?

03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:30.087
What do you mean,
it doesn't move?

03:54:30.087 --> 03:54:31.030
MATT: It's solid.

03:54:31.030 --> 03:54:32.905
LAURA: The lever's solid?

03:54:32.905 --> 03:54:34.330
MATT: It's not moving.

03:54:34.330 --> 03:54:37.810
MARISHA: Is like a
lever, or like a lever?

03:54:37.810 --> 03:54:39.590
MATT: It looks
like a little metal

03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:42.088
switch that had some
sort of a rotational bit,

03:54:42.088 --> 03:54:43.130
but it's locked in place.

03:54:43.130 --> 03:54:46.020
LIAM: Maybe he
has some sort of--

03:54:46.020 --> 03:54:46.820
MARISHA: Key.

03:54:46.820 --> 03:54:49.820
LIAM: -- staff or or key
of some device to turn it.

03:54:49.820 --> 03:54:51.980
Does it look like
some sort of gear?

03:54:51.980 --> 03:54:56.730
LAURA: Maybe it's like a rod that can't
be moved, or something.

03:54:56.730 --> 03:54:58.070
I heard about those things.

03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:59.350
TALIESIN: Wait a minute.

03:54:59.350 --> 03:55:00.892
What do we know
about the Dawnfather?

03:55:02.995 --> 03:55:08.703
LAURA: He likes the light a lot,
and there's some sun involved.

03:55:08.703 --> 03:55:10.870
MARISHA: Maybe we have to
do this when it's on fire.

03:55:10.870 --> 03:55:14.550
LAURA: And he's really tall,
and he doesn't have a face.

03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:17.250
And his head is only half there.

03:55:17.250 --> 03:55:18.500
MARISHA: Light it back up.

03:55:18.500 --> 03:55:20.630
TALIESIN: I'm going
to just double check

03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:22.430
all of them, including
the one just to see--

03:55:22.430 --> 03:55:25.050
MATT: Okay, it takes you a little
bit, but you scoop through.

03:55:25.050 --> 03:55:26.425
This is the only
one that has it.

03:55:26.425 --> 03:55:28.200
TALIESIN: All right,
put it all together.

03:55:28.200 --> 03:55:30.400
I'm going to light them
all up and get them going.

03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:31.200
MATT: Okay.

03:55:31.200 --> 03:55:33.350
So you put all the ash back
in, light them back up.

03:55:33.350 --> 03:55:35.606
The brazier is now
burning a bit.

03:55:35.606 --> 03:55:37.010
MARISHA: Huh!
(grunting)

03:55:37.010 --> 03:55:38.000
MATT: Okay, you reach in.

03:55:38.000 --> 03:55:40.240
Your hand takes--

03:55:40.240 --> 03:55:41.540
LIAM: How far down does it go?

03:55:41.540 --> 03:55:43.290
MATT: You take four
points of fire damage.

03:55:43.290 --> 03:55:45.200
I rolled really low.

03:55:45.200 --> 03:55:47.056
As you (sizzling)
reach in a grab it--

03:55:47.056 --> 03:55:47.856
MARISHA: Ouch, ouch, ouch.

03:55:47.856 --> 03:55:49.800
MATT: And it moves
without any resistance.

03:55:49.800 --> 03:55:50.600
(cheering)

03:55:50.600 --> 03:55:55.020
As soon as you move the switch
(rumbling) the stone center

03:55:55.020 --> 03:55:57.786
moves along about
five feet, revealing

03:55:57.786 --> 03:55:59.870
a staircase that descends
further down the hall.

03:55:59.870 --> 03:56:00.670
LAURA: Nice!

03:56:00.670 --> 03:56:01.626
MARISHA: We did it.

03:56:01.626 --> 03:56:03.990
TRAVIS: We only had to
burn two people.

03:56:06.696 --> 03:56:08.510
SAM: (As Pumat) Open the door!

03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:09.640
LAURA: No, don't do that!

03:56:09.640 --> 03:56:11.277
(laughter)

03:56:11.277 --> 03:56:12.361
SAM: (As Pumat) I'm dying!

03:56:12.361 --> 03:56:14.635
(laughter)

03:56:14.635 --> 03:56:16.870
LIAM: (laughs) Oh my god!

03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:18.833
MATT: So what's the
marching order here?

03:56:18.833 --> 03:56:20.605
ASHLEY: I'll go first.

03:56:20.605 --> 03:56:23.985
LIAM: Caleb is very
concerned about that,

03:56:23.985 --> 03:56:27.350
so he is going second.

03:56:27.350 --> 03:56:28.150
MATT: All righty.

03:56:28.150 --> 03:56:29.726
TALIESIN: I'll go third.

03:56:29.726 --> 03:56:36.173
MATT: Okay, so Yasha,
Caleb, Caduceus.

03:56:36.173 --> 03:56:37.340
TRAVIS: I'll be the caboose.

03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:39.513
TALIESIN: Once
you've been charmed,

03:56:39.513 --> 03:56:41.430
you can't be charmed
again for a while, right?

03:56:41.430 --> 03:56:42.638
MATT: Depends on the ability.

03:56:42.638 --> 03:56:44.013
TALIESIN: Depends
on the ability?

03:56:44.013 --> 03:56:45.970
LAURA: I'll go between
Beau and Fjord,

03:56:45.970 --> 03:56:48.510
if Beau is okay being
after Caduceus.

03:56:48.510 --> 03:56:51.010
MATT: Okay, so Beau is after
Caduceus, then Jester,

03:56:51.010 --> 03:56:53.140
then Fjord at the end.

03:56:53.140 --> 03:56:55.370
Got it, okay.

03:56:55.370 --> 03:56:56.170
Sounds good.

03:56:56.170 --> 03:56:58.050
Let's move this out of the way.

03:56:58.050 --> 03:57:01.018
TRAVIS: (whispering)
Oh, such a pretty map.

03:57:01.018 --> 03:57:03.670
We’re so spoiled, it's stupid.

03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:04.470
MARISHA: It's so true.

03:57:04.470 --> 03:57:05.728
LIAM: All of that
was for a puzzle solving.

03:57:05.728 --> 03:57:06.536
MATT: Dwarven Forge!

03:57:06.536 --> 03:57:08.370
MARISHA: For just-- yeah.
SAM: Dwarven Forge!

03:57:08.370 --> 03:57:11.650
TALIESIN: We could have been
in combat and still fighting.

03:57:11.650 --> 03:57:13.394
LAURA: God.

03:57:13.394 --> 03:57:14.880
TALIESIN: Been trying
to solve that.

03:57:14.880 --> 03:57:19.830
MATT: It is a very small
staircase, single file,

03:57:19.830 --> 03:57:22.350
heading down deeper and deeper.

03:57:22.350 --> 03:57:24.870
It spirals on and on
for what must a hundred

03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:28.290
feet beneath the crypt or more.

03:57:28.290 --> 03:57:30.930
Slowly making your way
through, until eventually,

03:57:30.930 --> 03:57:37.490
a faint bit of light is
visible to you, Yasha.

03:57:37.490 --> 03:57:39.130
The staircase comes to an end.

03:57:39.130 --> 03:57:43.010
The spiral flattens out
into a straight staircase

03:57:43.010 --> 03:57:45.230
that descends for an
additional 15 or so feet.

03:57:45.230 --> 03:57:49.464
And you can see an
archway that is open.

03:57:49.464 --> 03:57:55.390
It leads into a cylindrical-type chamber

03:57:55.390 --> 03:57:58.330
made of rough, ancient rock.

03:57:58.330 --> 03:58:05.230
There's three pillars in there, load bearing,
holding whatever this chamber is up.

03:58:05.230 --> 03:58:07.090
It's not an immense chamber.

03:58:07.090 --> 03:58:12.040
It's maybe 50, 60
feet across, maybe

03:58:12.040 --> 03:58:14.707
a little less than that, even.

03:58:14.707 --> 03:58:17.041
From what you can
just see as you glance

03:58:17.041 --> 03:58:19.660
down in the first look,

03:58:19.660 --> 03:58:23.110
there's an obelisk in
the center that has runes up

03:58:23.110 --> 03:58:29.595
the side that glow this constant, bright
white-yellow color.

03:58:29.595 --> 03:58:31.470
It's reminiscent of the
obelisks that you all

03:58:31.470 --> 03:58:33.860
have found in the King's Cage.

03:58:33.860 --> 03:58:38.050
But the script is Celestial.

03:58:38.050 --> 03:58:42.520
And it is old, very old.

03:58:45.730 --> 03:58:47.075
At the top of this obelisk--

03:58:47.075 --> 03:58:48.700
actually, at where
you're standing now,

03:58:48.700 --> 03:58:50.200
you wouldn't be
able to see the top.

03:58:50.200 --> 03:58:52.390
It is obfuscated by
the top of the archway

03:58:52.390 --> 03:58:55.710
that leads into the chamber.

03:58:55.710 --> 03:58:58.784
Make a perception check.

03:59:01.224 --> 03:59:02.950
ASHLEY: (whispering) Natural 20.

03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:03.750
MATT: Natural 20!

03:59:03.750 --> 03:59:06.340
TALIESIN: Wow!

03:59:06.920 --> 03:59:08.340
ASHLEY: I'm still
trying to be quiet.

03:59:08.340 --> 03:59:09.226
MATT: Right.
(laughter)

03:59:09.226 --> 03:59:11.262
What's the total with your
perception added to it?

03:59:11.262 --> 03:59:12.062
ASHLEY: 23.

03:59:12.062 --> 03:59:13.670
MATT: 23.

03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:16.130
Glancing down, you can
see between these three

03:59:16.130 --> 03:59:18.860
pillars and the
floor, and the obelisk

03:59:18.860 --> 03:59:20.660
that sits in the center,

03:59:20.660 --> 03:59:25.370
there are four
runic circles drawn

03:59:25.370 --> 03:59:32.660
on the ground in a jagged script
at the corner of this obelisk.

03:59:32.660 --> 03:59:35.870
Each corner having a circle.

03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:37.772
In one of the circles--

03:59:37.772 --> 03:59:38.590
ASHLEY: Say again?

03:59:38.590 --> 03:59:42.260
MATT: In one of the circles
on the opposite side,

03:59:42.260 --> 03:59:43.250
you see Nott standing.

03:59:43.250 --> 03:59:44.214
(gasping)

03:59:44.214 --> 03:59:46.142
LAURA: Oh no, Nott!

03:59:54.818 --> 03:59:55.835
ASHLEY: I just quietly--

03:59:55.835 --> 03:59:57.724
MATT: Nott.

03:59:57.724 --> 04:00:03.700
Actually, all of you
make stealth checks, please.

04:00:03.700 --> 04:00:05.750
SAM: My perception's
not that great.

04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:07.480
MATT: What's your
passive perception?

04:00:07.480 --> 04:00:09.510
SAM: It's pretty bad.

04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:10.310
11.

04:00:14.010 --> 04:00:14.810
MATT: Fjord?

04:00:14.810 --> 04:00:16.262
TRAVIS: 16.

04:00:16.262 --> 04:00:17.714
MARISHA: 16.

04:00:17.714 --> 04:00:19.650
LIAM: 14.

04:00:19.650 --> 04:00:21.102
LAURA: 15.

04:00:21.102 --> 04:00:22.070
TALIESIN: 13.

04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.870
ASHLEY: 16.

04:00:22.870 --> 04:00:25.558
MATT: Yeah, you have no idea.
SAM: Ah.

04:00:25.558 --> 04:00:26.980
(laughter)

04:00:26.980 --> 04:00:27.820
MATT: All right.

04:00:27.820 --> 04:00:30.970
So what do you guys do?

04:00:30.970 --> 04:00:32.760
ASHLEY: I'll bow my
head pretty quickly,

04:00:32.760 --> 04:00:37.647
and just say a quick
prayer to the Stormlord.

04:00:40.330 --> 04:00:42.540
Please, please don't
leave me again.

04:00:46.608 --> 04:00:49.390
MATT: As you say that, you close
your eyes and take a prayer.

04:00:51.940 --> 04:00:56.760
You hear thunder roll, but
it's not echoing around you.

04:00:56.760 --> 04:00:57.870
It's internally.

04:00:57.870 --> 04:01:00.090
And as it gets
louder and louder,

04:01:00.090 --> 04:01:04.380
you can feel the strength of
the storm pulsing through you.

04:01:04.380 --> 04:01:07.530
And for a moment, you can feel
the cold rain in your dreams

04:01:07.530 --> 04:01:09.110
falling upon your skin.

04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:10.790
A sense of peace comes over you.

04:01:13.538 --> 04:01:14.900
ASHLEY: Please stay there.

04:01:20.220 --> 04:01:28.971
Can I see any of the runes or
read any of the script on the--

04:01:28.971 --> 04:01:30.210
you said it's in Celestial?

04:01:30.210 --> 04:01:31.502
MATT: You read Celestial, yeah?

04:01:31.502 --> 04:01:33.200
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:01:33.200 --> 04:01:35.550
MATT: It's old, old Celestial.

04:01:38.460 --> 04:01:41.415
They speak of-- it's
less of a sentence,

04:01:41.415 --> 04:01:44.550
and it's more these very
intricate large runes

04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:49.500
that themselves are words.
Each is representative of an idea,

04:01:49.500 --> 04:01:53.020
as opposed to a
script of language.

04:01:53.020 --> 04:02:06.950
And it says, “eternal,” “bound,” “forever,”
“at bay,” “left to darkness,” “secret.”

04:02:07.938 --> 04:02:10.230
Based on everything you've known,
everything you've gathered,

04:02:10.230 --> 04:02:11.160
this in particular--

04:02:11.160 --> 04:02:14.330
this is probably the shackle.

04:02:14.330 --> 04:02:16.325
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

04:02:16.325 --> 04:02:17.295
TRAVIS: Oh jeez.

04:02:20.205 --> 04:02:23.420
ASHLEY: I try to relay
this information as

04:02:23.420 --> 04:02:25.910
quietly as I can
behind me, because I

04:02:25.910 --> 04:02:28.220
know we're single file here.

04:02:28.220 --> 04:02:30.480
LIAM: Caleb tries to
peek under her armpit

04:02:30.480 --> 04:02:31.910
and read the Celestial as well.

04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:32.710
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:02:32.710 --> 04:02:34.550
MATT: Okay.

04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:35.710
Make a perception check.

04:02:40.670 --> 04:02:42.015
LIAM: 20 total.

04:02:42.015 --> 04:02:44.140
MATT: Okay, you're able to
make out the same elements

04:02:44.140 --> 04:02:46.470
that she did.

04:02:46.470 --> 04:02:48.512
ASHLEY: (whispering) Do
you guys want to move in?

04:02:48.512 --> 04:02:50.643
TRAVIS: (whispering)
It's only Nott that you see?

04:02:50.643 --> 04:02:52.060
The other three
circles are empty?

04:02:52.060 --> 04:02:55.136
ASHLEY: (whispering) The
other three circles are empty.

04:02:55.136 --> 04:02:56.481
TRAVIS: It's clearly a trap.

04:02:56.481 --> 04:02:58.786
MARISHA: It's clearly a trap.

04:02:58.786 --> 04:03:01.052
TALIESIN: How far away are we?

04:03:01.052 --> 04:03:03.600
MATT: Well, you guys are
all in a line up at the top.

04:03:03.600 --> 04:03:06.830
Yasha's just at the top of the
stairs, flattening out.

04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:10.150
And so you're about,
I'd say, 10 feet,

04:03:10.150 --> 04:03:12.630
15 feet from the
archway that leads in.

04:03:12.630 --> 04:03:14.970
TALIESIN: How far from Nott?

04:03:14.970 --> 04:03:16.200
MATT: How far from Nott?

04:03:16.200 --> 04:03:18.940
I'd say maybe 30 feet.

04:03:18.940 --> 04:03:21.470
ASHLEY: Can I see
anything up above?

04:03:21.470 --> 04:03:24.345
MATT: No, because the archway is down
below you, and it's blocking it.

04:03:24.345 --> 04:03:26.175
You'd have to descend the
stairs to be able to get

04:03:26.175 --> 04:03:27.050
a better look inside.

04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:29.690
TRAVIS: Has it been an hour
since I cast See Invisibility?

04:03:29.690 --> 04:03:30.976
MATT: No.

04:03:31.900 --> 04:03:33.650
TRAVIS: Can I tap
everyone on the shoulder

04:03:33.650 --> 04:03:36.900
and have them move to the side,
still staying within where

04:03:36.900 --> 04:03:38.910
Yasha is, and just
look around the room

04:03:38.910 --> 04:03:39.710
and see if I see anyone?

04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:40.950
ASHLEY: I'll get up against
the wall so you can peek.

04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:42.408
LAURA: Before he
goes up, I'm going

04:03:42.408 --> 04:03:43.950
to grab your hand
as you walk past me

04:03:43.950 --> 04:03:46.546
and go: (whispering)
Please be careful.

04:03:46.546 --> 04:03:48.005
MATT: Are you
entering the archway?

04:03:48.005 --> 04:03:50.600
TRAVIS: No, no, from within the
archway, still from behind--

04:03:50.600 --> 04:03:52.430
MATT: Okay, you get
down and look inside,

04:03:52.430 --> 04:03:53.597
you don't see anything else.

04:03:53.597 --> 04:03:55.680
LIAM: Is Nott's
back to all of us?

04:03:55.680 --> 04:03:58.085
MATT: Nott is actually
facing the obelisk.

04:03:58.085 --> 04:04:00.643
LIAM: So we see her from
the front, or we see her--

04:04:00.643 --> 04:04:02.770
LAURA: (whispering) We can try
something, me and Caduceus.

04:04:02.770 --> 04:04:04.040
SAM: What?
TALIESIN: I can try and dispel.

04:04:04.040 --> 04:04:04.840
LAURA: Shh!

04:04:04.840 --> 04:04:06.096
TALIESIN: If you want.
LIAM: I can, too.

04:04:06.096 --> 04:04:07.273
LAURA: Yeah.

04:04:07.273 --> 04:04:09.285
TALIESIN: Are you going
to try and dispel?

04:04:09.285 --> 04:04:10.085
LIAM: I can.

04:04:10.085 --> 04:04:10.900
MARISHA: Do.

04:04:10.900 --> 04:04:13.110
TALIESIN: I can give you--

04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:14.790
so I think--

04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:18.000
I double-checked the
language, and I think Guidance

04:04:18.000 --> 04:04:19.333
will help with the dispel roll.

04:04:19.333 --> 04:04:21.667
TRAVIS: How far away is she?
MATT: It's an ability check.

04:04:21.667 --> 04:04:23.923
TALIESIN: Which is
what Guidance helps.

04:04:23.923 --> 04:04:24.840
LAURA: Ability checks.

04:04:24.840 --> 04:04:27.300
TALIESIN: "Add the number rolled to one
ability check of its choice."

04:04:28.260 --> 04:04:29.932
LAURA: Try it.

04:04:29.932 --> 04:04:32.328
TALIESIN: You got a d4.

04:04:33.280 --> 04:04:34.863
LIAM: (whispering)
I mutter as quietly

04:04:34.863 --> 04:04:36.696
as I can, and move my
hands through the air,

04:04:36.696 --> 04:04:39.460
and I cast it at 4th-level.

04:04:39.460 --> 04:04:40.260
MATT: At 4th-level?

04:04:40.260 --> 04:04:41.060
LIAM: Yeah.

04:04:41.060 --> 04:04:43.680
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll d20.

04:04:43.680 --> 04:04:46.190
Add your intelligence
modifier and your d4.

04:04:46.190 --> 04:04:50.750
LIAM: I'm going to use Fortune's
Favor to roll that again.

04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:51.650
Much better.

04:04:51.650 --> 04:04:53.109
What do I add to
that, did you say?

04:04:53.109 --> 04:04:54.440
MATT: d4, because it's--

04:04:54.440 --> 04:04:55.630
and your intelligence modifier.

04:04:55.630 --> 04:05:00.470
ASHLEY: I'm going to get ready
to run towards her in case he notices.

04:05:00.470 --> 04:05:01.690
LIAM: 25.

04:05:01.690 --> 04:05:02.490
MATT: 25.

04:05:05.390 --> 04:05:06.800
You will is your own.

04:05:06.800 --> 04:05:10.100
Unexpectedly, suddenly,
all of this strangeness--

04:05:10.100 --> 04:05:11.940
and it came from the doorway.

04:05:11.940 --> 04:05:13.600
SAM: What?

04:05:14.400 --> 04:05:16.142
SAM: Hello?

04:05:16.142 --> 04:05:17.510
ASHLEY: (shushing)

04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:19.450
SAM: Hello?

04:05:19.450 --> 04:05:22.120
LIAM: (whispering)
Pull out the wire.

04:05:22.120 --> 04:05:24.750
We are in the hallway.
All of us are here.

04:05:24.750 --> 04:05:27.140
Do not reply to this message.

04:05:29.275 --> 04:05:31.207
SAM: (moaning)

04:05:31.207 --> 04:05:36.454
(laughter)

04:05:38.935 --> 04:05:40.835
SAM: Praise be.

04:05:40.835 --> 04:05:43.926
TRAVIS: Don't oversell
it, motherfucker.

04:05:43.926 --> 04:05:45.650
LAURA: Obann is
going to know as soon

04:05:45.650 --> 04:05:47.012
as that thing is broken anyway.

04:05:47.012 --> 04:05:47.971
ASHLEY: Yeah, he knows.

04:05:47.971 --> 04:05:50.400
LIAM: (whispering) If they
are in there with you

04:05:50.400 --> 04:05:53.780
and you know it, cough one time.

04:05:53.780 --> 04:05:54.980
SAM: I look around.

04:05:54.980 --> 04:05:56.670
Is anyone in here with me?

04:05:56.670 --> 04:05:57.470
Do I know?

04:05:57.470 --> 04:05:58.762
LAURA: Did you know if anyone’s in there?

04:05:58.762 --> 04:06:00.160
SAM: Oh, whispers.

04:06:00.160 --> 04:06:02.850
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise.

04:06:02.850 --> 04:06:04.620
SAM: Remember, guys,
Disney Villainous.

04:06:04.620 --> 04:06:07.146
(laughter)

04:06:07.146 --> 04:06:08.650
It's a great sponsor--

04:06:08.650 --> 04:06:09.862
MATT: You fucking asshole.

04:06:09.862 --> 04:06:12.694
(laughter)

04:06:14.201 --> 04:06:16.410
ASHLEY: How many natural
ones have we rolled tonight?

04:06:16.410 --> 04:06:17.970
LAURA: Did anybody keep track?

04:06:17.970 --> 04:06:18.770
TRAVIS: Four, five?

04:06:18.770 --> 04:06:19.977
LAURA: No, it's at least--

04:06:19.977 --> 04:06:21.348
yes, it's five, I think.
ASHLEY: It was five.

04:06:21.348 --> 04:06:23.056
LIAM: You're responsible
for two of them.

04:06:23.056 --> 04:06:23.870
ASHLEY: Yep.

04:06:26.375 --> 04:06:28.494
SAM: (coughing and hacking)

04:06:30.462 --> 04:06:31.446
(moaning)

04:06:32.423 --> 04:06:34.340
ASHLEY: The cough was
if someone was in there?

04:06:34.340 --> 04:06:37.703
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

04:06:37.703 --> 04:06:39.120
LAURA: (whispering)
So what we do?

04:06:39.120 --> 04:06:39.920
What do we do?

04:06:39.920 --> 04:06:41.753
MARISHA: (whispering)
Do you all have things

04:06:41.753 --> 04:06:45.080
that could help us our wisdom?

04:06:45.080 --> 04:06:47.060
LAURA: (whispering)
I mean, I can cast.

04:06:47.060 --> 04:06:48.890
I'll cast Bless.

04:06:48.890 --> 04:06:50.855
SAM: What?

04:06:50.855 --> 04:06:52.980
LAURA: I'll cast Bless--
we're whispering--

04:06:52.980 --> 04:06:55.303
I'll cast Bless on--

04:06:55.303 --> 04:06:57.220
TALIESIN: If you do it
at a high enough level,

04:06:57.220 --> 04:07:00.307
you can bless everybody,
or both of us can bless.

04:07:00.307 --> 04:07:02.390
It's a 4th-level for--
LIAM: Don't forget I cast--

04:07:02.390 --> 04:07:03.349
ASHLEY: Fortune's Favor.

04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:06.410
TALIESIN: 2nd-level, 3rd-level, 4th-level.

04:07:06.410 --> 04:07:08.560
Yeah, we could split
it, or I could also do--

04:07:08.560 --> 04:07:10.890
MARISHA: You don't
have to worry about me,

04:07:10.890 --> 04:07:12.360
necessarily, since I can save from it.

04:07:12.360 --> 04:07:14.710
LAURA: Because you have it
one, two, three, four, five.

04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:16.401
ASHLEY: You can continue to do that?
MARISHA: I can do that.

04:07:16.401 --> 04:07:18.566
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, because
Nott's probably fine.

04:07:18.566 --> 04:07:19.366
LAURA: Yeah.

04:07:19.366 --> 04:07:23.940
TALIESIN: That's level three.

04:07:23.940 --> 04:07:26.480
Or we can do less,
if you prefer.

04:07:26.480 --> 04:07:28.270
Or actually, we might--

04:07:28.270 --> 04:07:29.770
LAURA: Let's both do level one.

04:07:29.770 --> 04:07:31.910
TALIESIN: Just both
do level one blasts?

04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:32.710
LAURA: Yeah.

04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:34.210
TALIESIN: All right.

04:07:34.210 --> 04:07:38.785
I'll take-- who do
you want to take?

04:07:38.785 --> 04:07:44.162
LAURA: I'll take Fjord
and Caleb and you.

04:07:44.162 --> 04:07:46.782
TALIESIN: All right,
and I'll take--

04:07:46.782 --> 04:07:49.780
MARISHA: I mean, I'll take it if
you still want to give one out,

04:07:49.780 --> 04:07:52.440
but don't necessarily need it.

04:07:53.680 --> 04:07:56.480
TALIESIN: Yeah, actually-- yeah,
just because it's for attack.

04:07:56.480 --> 04:07:58.280
LAURA: Yeah, mine as well.

04:07:58.280 --> 04:08:00.230
ASHLEY: What's that do again?

04:08:00.230 --> 04:08:02.548
LAURA: Okay, so we're all covered.
TRAVIS: What's Bless do again?

04:08:02.548 --> 04:08:04.090
MARISHA: So wait,
are we all blessed?

04:08:04.090 --> 04:08:05.440
LAURA: Yeah, we're all blessed.

04:08:05.440 --> 04:08:06.692
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll
do it at level two.

04:08:06.692 --> 04:08:08.657
MATT: How many blessed today?
TALIESIN: Everybody's blessed.

04:08:08.657 --> 04:08:09.740
MATT: Everybody's blessed.

04:08:09.740 --> 04:08:11.157
ASHLEY: What does
that mean again?

04:08:11.157 --> 04:08:13.510
TALIESIN: You have a d4 to
attacks and d4 to saves.

04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:14.677
ASHLEY: (whispering) Got it.

04:08:14.677 --> 04:08:15.860
LIAM: Attacks and saves.

04:08:15.860 --> 04:08:17.470
TALIESIN: But I
would say let's not

04:08:17.470 --> 04:08:19.810
cast it until right at the--

04:08:19.810 --> 04:08:22.270
because it's one minute.

04:08:22.270 --> 04:08:24.110
So let's cast it
once shit starts.

04:08:24.110 --> 04:08:25.123
LAURA: Like as soon as
we know we're about to go

04:08:25.123 --> 04:08:26.662
in, that's when we would cast?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:08:26.662 --> 04:08:27.667
TRAVIS: Like as soon
as we walk in--

04:08:27.667 --> 04:08:30.400
MATT: Which is whenever you guys want to.
TRAVIS: --the portal is going to get it on.

04:08:30.400 --> 04:08:31.430
TALIESIN: All right.

04:08:31.430 --> 04:08:32.388
MATT: What's the plan?

04:08:32.388 --> 04:08:33.430
TALIESIN: We'll walk in--

04:08:33.430 --> 04:08:34.610
TRAVIS: Shall we?

04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:38.200
LIAM: Before we do, I whisper:
(whispering) We are coming in.

04:08:38.200 --> 04:08:40.480
Don't do anything rash.

04:08:40.480 --> 04:08:44.710
LAURA: (whispering) Or maybe
just just tell her to run,

04:08:44.710 --> 04:08:47.511
and then you can send a
Fireball in there or something?

04:08:47.511 --> 04:08:49.336
LIAM: (whispering) No.

04:08:49.336 --> 04:08:50.660
TRAVIS: Three.

04:08:50.660 --> 04:08:52.120
TALIESIN: Two.

04:08:52.120 --> 04:08:53.135
MARISHA: One.

04:08:53.135 --> 04:08:54.787
ASHLEY: Start walking in.

04:08:54.787 --> 04:08:55.681
LAURA: (whooshing)

04:08:55.681 --> 04:08:57.540
MATT: All right.

04:08:57.540 --> 04:09:00.360
As you enter the
chamber, Yasha first,

04:09:00.360 --> 04:09:05.010
you now see this 15-foot
tall obelisk rises up.

04:09:05.010 --> 04:09:07.710
And at the top is just
this bright light,

04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:10.240
impossibly bright, like
you cannot look into it,

04:09:10.240 --> 04:09:11.040
it's so bright.

04:09:11.040 --> 04:09:13.500
It lights up the
top of the chamber.

04:09:13.500 --> 04:09:17.160
Three thick, gold
chains emanate from it

04:09:17.160 --> 04:09:20.333
to connect to the different
walls of the room.

04:09:20.333 --> 04:09:21.750
And you see nothing
else in there.

04:09:24.900 --> 04:09:28.490
SAM: Lots of Dwarven
Forge tonight, guys.

04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:29.655
It's the Dwarven Forgiest.

04:09:32.416 --> 04:09:33.242
TRAVIS: Ooh!

04:09:33.242 --> 04:09:34.201
LIAM: Oh, the chains!

04:09:34.201 --> 04:09:35.420
LAURA: Oh cool!

04:09:35.420 --> 04:09:36.730
SAM: That's Dwarven Forge.

04:09:36.730 --> 04:09:37.830
Wow, Matt!

04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:38.630
Wow!

04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:40.620
LIAM: Fuck, dude!

04:09:40.620 --> 04:09:42.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, you
were busy this week.

04:09:42.500 --> 04:09:44.333
LIAM: Yeah!
TALIESIN: So are those circles--

04:09:44.333 --> 04:09:46.900
MATT: The circles are where
you saw the runic circles

04:09:46.900 --> 04:09:47.700
in the ground.

04:09:47.700 --> 04:09:48.867
LAURA: Which one is Nott in?

04:09:48.867 --> 04:09:52.570
MATT: Nott is in this one.

04:09:52.570 --> 04:09:54.125
TALIESIN: And no one else is--

04:09:54.125 --> 04:09:58.580
TRAVIS: Can I do a onceover
with my see-invisible eye?

04:09:58.580 --> 04:10:00.230
MATT: Yasha, you enter?
ASHLEY: Yep.

04:10:00.230 --> 04:10:01.030
MATT: All right.

04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:02.490
Do you all enter
alongside Yasha?

04:10:02.490 --> 04:10:04.240
MARISHA: We start fanning out.

04:10:04.240 --> 04:10:06.970
LIAM: I'm going to hang
in the doorway, I think.

04:10:06.970 --> 04:10:08.434
MATT: Okay.

04:10:08.434 --> 04:10:11.080
MARISHA: I'm going to run over
and flank towards Nott.

04:10:11.080 --> 04:10:13.500
TALIESIN: I'll go to the left
underneath that first gold

04:10:13.500 --> 04:10:14.300
chain, yeah.

04:10:14.300 --> 04:10:15.250
MATT: Okay.

04:10:15.250 --> 04:10:16.050
I'll put you there.

04:10:16.050 --> 04:10:18.266
TALIESIN: Like against the wall.
MATT: Against the wall?

04:10:18.266 --> 04:10:19.066
TALIESIN: Always.

04:10:19.066 --> 04:10:21.723
LIAM: Oh my gosh. (like Caduceus) It's bad.
We’re running.

04:10:21.723 --> 04:10:23.140
MATT: Beau, you're
going this way?

04:10:23.140 --> 04:10:26.050
MARISHA: That way, yeah, under
the other gold chain, yep.

04:10:26.050 --> 04:10:27.925
And back to the
wall, same thing.

04:10:27.925 --> 04:10:29.810
MATT: Okay.

04:10:29.810 --> 04:10:31.795
Jester, Fjord?

04:10:31.795 --> 04:10:36.766
LAURA: I mean, I guess I'll
go in right next to the door.

04:10:36.766 --> 04:10:37.600
MATT: Right here?

04:10:37.600 --> 04:10:39.434
LAURA: Yeah, I'll just
go to the side of it.

04:10:39.434 --> 04:10:40.510
MATT: Right here?

04:10:40.510 --> 04:10:41.310
LAURA: Yeah.

04:10:41.310 --> 04:10:43.210
MATT: Okay.

04:10:43.210 --> 04:10:46.708
TALIESIN: Looking for anything
that hints of movement.

04:10:46.708 --> 04:10:47.750
LAURA: We just walked in.

04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:48.625
You saw us coming in.

04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:51.130
MATT: You guys all walk in.

04:10:51.130 --> 04:10:53.056
Fjord, you were towards
the back, right?

04:10:53.056 --> 04:10:54.522
TRAVIS: No, I walked
up towards the front

04:10:54.522 --> 04:10:56.230
and tried to look in
through the doorway.

04:10:56.230 --> 04:10:57.475
MATT: Right,
through the archway.

04:10:57.475 --> 04:10:58.600
But as we all enter, when--

04:10:58.600 --> 04:10:59.809
TRAVIS: I was near the front.

04:10:59.809 --> 04:11:03.930
SAM: Matty, do I
remember my state?

04:11:03.930 --> 04:11:05.950
Like, am I hypnotized?

04:11:05.950 --> 04:11:07.353
Was I asked to stay here?

04:11:07.353 --> 04:11:08.770
MATT: You were
told to stay there.

04:11:08.770 --> 04:11:12.150
SAM: Told to stay here,
but like I have my--

04:11:12.150 --> 04:11:13.650
MATT: You do now
have your own will.

04:11:13.650 --> 04:11:14.650
SAM: No, I know I do.

04:11:14.650 --> 04:11:19.360
But what I was instructed
by my prior master--

04:11:19.360 --> 04:11:23.530
I'm just wondering-- if
they came in the room,

04:11:23.530 --> 04:11:25.690
I would shoot at
them if I were trying

04:11:25.690 --> 04:11:31.147
to give off the illusion that
I was still mind-controlled.

04:11:31.147 --> 04:11:33.481
MATT: If you were trying to
put out that illusion, yeah.

04:11:33.481 --> 04:11:36.970
SAM: Okay, so as soon as they
walk in, I fire a bolt,

04:11:36.970 --> 04:11:39.560
scream, and run to the
corner of the room,

04:11:39.560 --> 04:11:41.310
and intentionally miss.

04:11:41.310 --> 04:11:43.480
MATT: Okay.

04:11:43.480 --> 04:11:44.735
So you run off-- which corner?

04:11:44.735 --> 04:11:46.045
SAM: Back left.

04:11:46.045 --> 04:11:47.184
MATT: Back this way.

04:11:47.184 --> 04:11:47.984
Okay.

04:11:47.984 --> 04:11:50.404
SAM: (shrieking) Intruders!

04:11:50.404 --> 04:11:53.240
MATT: As you all
walk in and fan out--

04:11:53.240 --> 04:11:56.910
Fjord, you look
around and look up,

04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:58.480
and you're the only
one who can see.

04:11:58.480 --> 04:11:59.846
MARISHA: (whispering) Oh my god!

04:11:59.846 --> 04:12:03.910
MATT: Obann and the Caedogeist,
who are both floating up

04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:07.150
at the top of the chamber,
about 50 feet up above you,

04:12:07.150 --> 04:12:10.870
where the load-bearing pillars
are all coming to

04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:14.020
a pyramid-type
gathering at the top

04:12:14.020 --> 04:12:15.550
to keep this whole chamber up.

04:12:15.550 --> 04:12:18.265
And they're just
up there watching you all.

04:12:18.265 --> 04:12:21.426
And right as you look
up at them, Obann goes (snaps)--

04:12:21.426 --> 04:12:22.510
and they both (whooshing).

04:12:22.510 --> 04:12:23.410
Everyone roll initiative.

04:12:23.410 --> 04:12:26.850
MARISHA: Oh, it's so Hereditary.

04:12:26.850 --> 04:12:30.010
LAURA: Oh, I don't like it.

04:12:30.010 --> 04:12:33.140
MARISHA: Oh my
god, my initiative!

04:12:33.140 --> 04:12:35.970
LAURA: Hereditary,
creepy as fuck.

04:12:35.970 --> 04:12:37.140
SAM: (quick inhale and exhale)

04:12:37.847 --> 04:12:39.700
LAURA: No, that's Midsommar.

04:12:41.520 --> 04:12:43.143
MATT: All right, 25 to 20.

04:12:43.143 --> 04:12:44.310
SAM: Always with weird sound effects.

04:12:44.310 --> 04:12:45.240
TRAVIS: 25 to 20.

04:12:45.240 --> 04:12:46.350
LAURA: Yeah.

04:12:46.350 --> 04:12:47.635
TRAVIS: Nobody.

04:12:47.635 --> 04:12:48.885
LAURA: Nobody? Nobody? Nobody.

04:12:48.885 --> 04:12:49.685
Tight!

04:12:49.685 --> 04:12:50.645
MATT: 20 to 15.

04:12:50.645 --> 04:12:51.445
TRAVIS: 18.

04:12:51.445 --> 04:12:52.300
TALIESIN: 17.

04:12:52.300 --> 04:12:53.490
ASHLEY: 15.

04:12:53.490 --> 04:12:54.960
LIAM: Wow!

04:12:54.960 --> 04:12:56.890
LIAM: Are you sure
you're Ashley Johnson?

04:12:56.890 --> 04:12:58.174
(laughter)

04:12:58.174 --> 04:13:00.611
MATT: 15 to 10.

04:13:00.611 --> 04:13:01.750
LAURA: Oh.

04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:02.644
Oh no.

04:13:02.644 --> 04:13:04.130
10.

04:13:04.130 --> 04:13:04.930
MATT: All right.

04:13:04.930 --> 04:13:06.710
TRAVIS: Fjord,
Yasha, and who is it?

04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:08.095
15--

04:13:08.095 --> 04:13:10.540
ASHLEY: Caduceus--
Cad-doose-is--

04:13:10.540 --> 04:13:11.480
was 17.

04:13:11.480 --> 04:13:12.280
MATT: 10 to five.

04:13:12.280 --> 04:13:13.790
LIAM: <i>Fünf.</i>
MARISHA: Eight.

04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:14.590
SAM: Seven!

04:13:14.590 --> 04:13:15.635
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

04:13:15.635 --> 04:13:17.230
SAM: Seven.

04:13:17.230 --> 04:13:18.720
LAURA: So then it's Beau, Nott--

04:13:18.720 --> 04:13:22.030
MATT: Beau, Nott, then Caleb.

04:13:22.030 --> 04:13:22.830
All righty.

04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:24.491
TRAVIS: Sorry, can you run
it down from top to bottom?

04:13:24.491 --> 04:13:26.140
I can't read my own
fucking handwriting.

04:13:26.140 --> 04:13:26.940
Fjord, Caduceus?

04:13:26.940 --> 04:13:29.540
MATT: Fjord, Caduceus, Yasha,
Jester, Beau, Nott, Caleb.

04:13:29.540 --> 04:13:30.460
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

04:13:34.140 --> 04:13:35.307
MATT: All right.

04:13:35.307 --> 04:13:37.140
SAM: (singing) Dun, dun, dun.
Dun, dun, dun.

04:13:37.140 --> 04:13:38.690
MATT: Top of the round.

04:13:40.780 --> 04:13:42.105
LIAM: Goodness gracious.

04:13:42.105 --> 04:13:45.380
MATT: Appearing from invisible,
right by your side, Beauregard,

04:13:45.380 --> 04:13:47.310
as you were on that
end, the Caedogeist

04:13:47.310 --> 04:13:51.375
appears, and (whooshing) goes
to shunt the blade into you.

04:13:51.375 --> 04:13:53.730
MARISHA: (singing) This
is not going to be good.

04:13:53.730 --> 04:13:58.170
MATT: That's going to
be with advantage--

04:13:58.170 --> 04:14:00.340
not a great roll, but still 22.

04:14:00.340 --> 04:14:01.576
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:14:01.576 --> 04:14:04.626
LAURA: Come on, none
of us are over 20.

04:14:04.626 --> 04:14:05.970
SAM: Years old.

04:14:05.970 --> 04:14:08.080
LAURA: We're so
young, oh my god!

04:14:08.080 --> 04:14:10.080
SAM: Guys, I can rent a car now.

04:14:10.080 --> 04:14:11.497
MARISHA: (singing)
Fucking damage.

04:14:11.497 --> 04:14:12.690
(laughter)

04:14:12.690 --> 04:14:14.595
LAURA: I can't drink yet, but

04:14:16.735 --> 04:14:20.398
it's a good trade off,
because I'm so young.

04:14:20.398 --> 04:14:22.780
MATT: That's a really, really
bad sneak attack roll.

04:14:22.780 --> 04:14:24.480
Three, two, two, three, one--

04:14:24.480 --> 04:14:25.730
so you're lucky on that one.

04:14:25.730 --> 04:14:28.675
SAM: I eat anything and
never gain any weight.

04:14:28.675 --> 04:14:33.725
MATT: You take 35 points
of slashing damage.

04:14:33.725 --> 04:14:35.940
I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

04:14:35.940 --> 04:14:36.740
LIAM: Damn it.

04:14:40.958 --> 04:14:42.454
SAM: Ooh!

04:14:42.454 --> 04:14:45.036
MARISHA: Oh, is that cocked?

04:14:45.036 --> 04:14:46.620
SAM: Looks like you
can read a number.

04:14:46.620 --> 04:14:47.420
MATT: Nope.

04:14:47.420 --> 04:14:48.870
MARISHA: Okay, what was it?

04:14:48.870 --> 04:14:49.670
Constitution save?
MATT: Yes.

04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:51.709
MARISHA: Ooh, ooh, and a Bless?
And I'm blessed?

04:14:51.709 --> 04:14:53.169
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah.

04:14:53.410 --> 04:14:55.020
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

04:14:55.020 --> 04:14:55.890
SAM: Am I blessed?

04:14:55.890 --> 04:14:56.955
MARISHA: 27.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:14:56.955 --> 04:14:58.830
MATT: Yeah, you resist
the poison, no worries.

04:14:58.830 --> 04:15:00.914
TALIESIN: You add a d4 to
attacks.

04:15:00.914 --> 04:15:04.295
MATT: Second strike going to be a 19.

04:15:04.295 --> 04:15:05.095
MARISHA: Miss.

04:15:05.095 --> 04:15:06.370
MATT: Misses.

04:15:06.370 --> 04:15:09.000
So the first blow hits,
and the blade withdraws.

04:15:09.000 --> 04:15:12.210
The poison and blood
spilt across the stonework.

04:15:12.210 --> 04:15:14.375
And on the other strike, you
just parry it out of the way.

04:15:14.375 --> 04:15:16.125
She's going to attempt
to move into the wall.

04:15:16.125 --> 04:15:18.000
MARISHA: I just healed
that wound, bitch!

04:15:18.000 --> 04:15:19.010
TRAVIS: Sentry?

04:15:19.010 --> 04:15:21.023
MATT: Oh, you do get
an attack of opportunity. Go for it.

04:15:21.023 --> 04:15:22.623
TALIESIN: Add a d4 to your attack.
LAURA: Sentinel!

04:15:22.623 --> 04:15:25.080
MARISHA: (whispering)
Goddamn, goddamn, come

04:15:25.080 --> 04:15:26.372
on, please, don't fuck this up.

04:15:26.372 --> 04:15:28.890
Please don't fuck this up.

04:15:28.890 --> 04:15:30.615
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:15:30.615 --> 04:15:31.415
Yeah, 27.

04:15:31.415 --> 04:15:32.380
MATT: That hits.

04:15:32.380 --> 04:15:34.685
Go ahead and roll damage.

04:15:34.685 --> 04:15:36.830
MARISHA: Yes!

04:15:36.830 --> 04:15:39.620
12 damage, and that
bitch is staying here.

04:15:39.620 --> 04:15:41.210
MATT: Yeah, she can't move.

04:15:41.210 --> 04:15:43.370
She gets punched, and you grab.

04:15:43.370 --> 04:15:47.710
And your mystical hands that
can-- you punch ghosts.

04:15:47.710 --> 04:15:50.173
As she goes into
a ghostly mode,

04:15:50.173 --> 04:15:51.590
you reach out and
grab her throat,

04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:52.764
and yank and hold
her there in place.

04:15:52.764 --> 04:15:54.830
And she's like, (choking) and
looks at you with these eyes

04:15:54.830 --> 04:15:56.122
of like, what the fuck are you?

04:15:56.122 --> 04:15:57.905
MARISHA: You cut
my brand new robes.

04:15:57.905 --> 04:16:02.780
MATT: All right, that
finishes her turn.

04:16:02.780 --> 04:16:07.820
The mirrored form now expands
out of her over that strike.

04:16:07.820 --> 04:16:11.012
MARISHA: No, no, no, keep going.

04:16:11.012 --> 04:16:12.210
MATT: Which, actually, yeah.

04:16:12.210 --> 04:16:14.100
I'm going to see if--

04:16:14.100 --> 04:16:15.280
no, she fucking rolled two.

04:16:15.280 --> 04:16:17.780
All right, so the mirrored
form doesn't affect her,

04:16:17.780 --> 04:16:19.065
but she still has--

04:16:19.065 --> 04:16:19.877
TRAVIS: A duplicate?

04:16:19.877 --> 04:16:21.055
MATT: Her three
duplicates around her.

04:16:21.055 --> 04:16:21.855
TRAVIS: Three!

04:16:21.855 --> 04:16:23.230
LAURA: Right, right. Mirror Image.

04:16:23.230 --> 04:16:24.540
LIAM: Jesus Christ.

04:16:24.540 --> 04:16:26.540
MATT: So you do still hit
her with that, though.

04:16:26.540 --> 04:16:28.990
So she’s still held in
place with a speed of zero.

04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:31.040
Finishing her turn.
Fjord, you're up.

04:16:31.040 --> 04:16:32.150
Caduceus, you're on deck.

04:16:32.150 --> 04:16:35.510
TRAVIS: Can I see Obann
invisible in the air?

04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:36.930
MATT: You, can actually.

04:16:36.930 --> 04:16:37.730
LAURA: Nice!

04:16:37.730 --> 04:16:41.992
MATT: And he is up
on this end here.

04:16:41.992 --> 04:16:44.600
LAURA: Oh my god,
summon a demon.

04:16:44.600 --> 04:16:47.710
(laughter)

04:16:47.710 --> 04:16:48.880
TRAVIS: Too fucking soon.

04:16:48.880 --> 04:16:52.310
(laughter)

04:16:52.310 --> 04:16:56.270
TRAVIS: Can I move up
forward, and peek out

04:16:56.270 --> 04:16:57.800
from just behind this pillar?

04:16:57.800 --> 04:17:00.285
Move forward up towards
it, and with my--

04:17:00.285 --> 04:17:01.085
MATT: Right here?

04:17:01.085 --> 04:17:02.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, just on this side right here.

04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:03.550
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

04:17:03.550 --> 04:17:06.290
TRAVIS: With my last
spell, activating

04:17:06.290 --> 04:17:09.290
the sword, can I grip
it, make the blade pulse,

04:17:09.290 --> 04:17:14.120
and I will reach in and say:
Wildmother, shine your light.

04:17:14.120 --> 04:17:16.365
And I will cast
Faerie Fire on Obann.

04:17:16.365 --> 04:17:17.165
MARISHA: Ooh!

04:17:17.165 --> 04:17:19.270
MATT: Oh shit! Okay.

04:17:19.270 --> 04:17:21.062
LIAM: Eat shit, Obann.

04:17:21.062 --> 04:17:24.690
TRAVIS: And he cannot
be invisible anymore.

04:17:24.690 --> 04:17:26.410
Dexterity 15 saving throw.

04:17:26.410 --> 04:17:27.210
MATT: Gotcha.

04:17:27.210 --> 04:17:28.710
SAM: He’s pretty dextrous.

04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:29.735
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:17:29.735 --> 04:17:30.567
It's always worth
a shot, though.

04:17:30.567 --> 04:17:32.423
SAM: Yes, that's a great idea.
LAURA: Give me a one!

04:17:32.423 --> 04:17:34.090
Natural one!
MATT: It was a natural one.

04:17:34.090 --> 04:17:34.890
MARISHA: Shut up!

04:17:34.890 --> 04:17:36.601
MATT: But he has resistance.

04:17:36.601 --> 04:17:37.810
SAM: (whispering) Resistance?

04:17:37.810 --> 04:17:39.060
MATT: He has magic resistance.

04:17:39.060 --> 04:17:41.373
He gets advantage on
saving throws against spells.

04:17:41.373 --> 04:17:42.290
Natural fucking three.

04:17:42.290 --> 04:17:44.174
TRAVIS: (yelling) Ooh, yay!

04:17:44.174 --> 04:17:45.120
Not invisible anymore!

04:17:45.120 --> 04:17:46.985
LIAM: But that
one is $500.

04:17:46.985 --> 04:17:47.860
LAURA: Does it count?

04:17:47.860 --> 04:17:48.660
TRAVIS: No.

04:17:50.570 --> 04:17:51.980
MARISHA: It's only when it--

04:17:51.980 --> 04:17:53.314
LIAM: Only when it sticks?

04:17:53.314 --> 04:17:54.692
TRAVIS: Wow, okay.

04:17:54.692 --> 04:17:59.010
MATT: So yeah, he's sparkly.

04:17:59.010 --> 04:18:02.120
So you guys watch
as Obann suddenly--

04:18:02.120 --> 04:18:06.185
you watch as Fjord walks
out, grasps, and thinks of the Wildmother,

04:18:06.185 --> 04:18:07.140
and then
as he puts his hand up,

04:18:07.140 --> 04:18:08.971
there's a (whooshing)
like a small--

04:18:08.971 --> 04:18:10.680
reminiscent of a small
Hupperdook party--

04:18:10.680 --> 04:18:12.810
a firework goes off in
the upper part of the chamber.

04:18:12.810 --> 04:18:17.010
And as the sparkles fall,
they gather and outline

04:18:17.010 --> 04:18:18.860
sticking to the form of Obann.

04:18:18.860 --> 04:18:21.770
You can now see him
(wings flapping) in the air.

04:18:21.770 --> 04:18:23.570
And he's like, (hissing).

04:18:23.570 --> 04:18:24.470
TRAVIS: Great.

04:18:24.470 --> 04:18:28.640
I will, with my bonus
action, just turn back around

04:18:28.640 --> 04:18:29.890
and put my back to the pillar.

04:18:29.890 --> 04:18:30.690
MATT: Okay.

04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:34.470
TRAVIS: That’s my turn.

04:18:34.470 --> 04:18:35.290
MATT: All right.

04:18:35.290 --> 04:18:36.090
Finishing your go.

04:18:36.090 --> 04:18:39.306
Caduceus, you're up, and
then Yasha, you're on deck.

04:18:39.306 --> 04:18:41.757
SAM: Does Faerie Fire give
any advantage or anything?

04:18:41.757 --> 04:18:43.591
MARISHA: Yeah, you get
advantage on attacks.

04:18:43.591 --> 04:18:44.770
SAM: On all attacks?

04:18:44.770 --> 04:18:45.570
LIAM: He's shiny.

04:18:45.570 --> 04:18:49.230
MATT: Faerie Fire is nasty.

04:18:49.230 --> 04:18:50.665
That fucking sucks for him.

04:18:50.665 --> 04:18:51.915
TRAVIS: I'm officially at empty.

04:18:51.915 --> 04:18:55.620
TALIESIN: Are we starting
there, then, I suppose?

04:18:55.620 --> 04:18:57.720
ASHLEY: We have advantage on all attacks?
LAURA: Against Obann, yeah.

04:18:57.720 --> 04:18:59.304
MARISHA: I think we
start wherever it

04:18:59.304 --> 04:19:01.120
makes the most fucking sense.

04:19:01.120 --> 04:19:04.850
TALIESIN: How far away is he
from me right now?

04:19:04.850 --> 04:19:07.170
MATT: Right now--
he's about from you

04:19:07.170 --> 04:19:08.396
at this moment, 55 feet.

04:19:08.396 --> 04:19:10.815
TALIESIN: Okay, there's no way I
could get within 30 feet of him

04:19:10.815 --> 04:19:11.472
right now?

04:19:11.472 --> 04:19:13.210
MATT: No, no, he's too
high up in the air.

04:19:13.210 --> 04:19:14.543
TALIESIN: Okay, so I am going to--

04:19:14.543 --> 04:19:15.960
I figure everyone
else has got it.

04:19:15.960 --> 04:19:20.990
I'm going to back up from him
a little bit against the wall.

04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:23.756
And if I can see our
other friend over here,

04:19:23.756 --> 04:19:24.840
who seems pretty stunned--

04:19:24.840 --> 04:19:26.340
MATT: You can.

04:19:26.340 --> 04:19:32.295
TALIESIN: I'm going to
hit her with Blight.

04:19:32.295 --> 04:19:35.092
MATT: A Blight, okay.

04:19:35.092 --> 04:19:36.750
TALIESIN: That's a
constitution save.

04:19:36.750 --> 04:19:39.150
MATT: That is.

04:19:39.150 --> 04:19:40.236
Natural 20.

04:19:40.236 --> 04:19:41.110
TRAVIS: Oh!

04:19:41.110 --> 04:19:41.910
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:43.820
Still takes damage,
though, right?

04:19:43.820 --> 04:19:46.384
MATT: Correct. It's necrotic, right?

04:19:46.384 --> 04:19:47.080
TALIESIN: It's necrotic.

04:19:47.080 --> 04:19:49.039
MATT: She does not have
resistance to necrotic.

04:19:49.039 --> 04:19:51.906
TALIESIN: No, so that's a lot.

04:19:51.906 --> 04:19:54.240
MATT: They have had time to
heal since your last battle,

04:19:54.240 --> 04:19:55.824
so the wounds that
were taken upstairs

04:19:55.824 --> 04:19:56.950
have been taken care of, so they’re both at full.

04:19:56.950 --> 04:19:58.500
TALIESIN: Oh, that's good.

04:19:58.500 --> 04:20:00.220
Actually, can I borrow this for a second?
LAURA: They healed?

04:20:00.220 --> 04:20:01.780
MATT: You guys got
a chance to heal.

04:20:01.780 --> 04:20:03.085
LAURA: Yeah, but not fully.

04:20:03.085 --> 04:20:04.732
We didn't take a full rest.

04:20:04.732 --> 04:20:06.066
SAM: Yeah, but they're powerful.

04:20:06.066 --> 04:20:08.680
LAURA: They're way
more powerful than us.

04:20:09.570 --> 04:20:10.980
TALIESIN: Five, six.

04:20:10.980 --> 04:20:12.700
Oh my god, this is amazing.

04:20:16.380 --> 04:20:19.400
So total here is--

04:20:20.370 --> 04:20:22.630
MATT: You guys also spent,
like, a long time searching

04:20:22.630 --> 04:20:23.615
that chamber above, too.

04:20:23.615 --> 04:20:25.740
LIAM: At least 20 minutes
fucking with that shit.

04:20:25.740 --> 04:20:27.514
MATT: Probably like a half
an hour or so with everything

04:20:27.514 --> 04:20:29.415
you were doing.

04:20:29.415 --> 04:20:31.200
LAURA: Just shy of
an hour, probably,

04:20:31.200 --> 04:20:32.210
before we got down here.

04:20:32.210 --> 04:20:39.915
TALIESIN: So 20, 36, 42, 51
points of necrotic damage.

04:20:39.915 --> 04:20:41.260
MATT: That's some crazy rolls!

04:20:41.260 --> 04:20:43.522
TALIESIN: I rolled eight, six, eight,
six, eight six, four, five.

04:20:43.522 --> 04:20:44.022
MATT: Jesus!

04:20:44.022 --> 04:20:47.334
TALIESIN: Yeah, 8d8, and almost all
of them were eights and sixes.

04:20:47.334 --> 04:20:47.840
MATT: 51?

04:20:47.840 --> 04:20:48.980
TALIESIN: Yeah, 51.

04:20:48.980 --> 04:20:50.480
MATT: Still halved,
but even halved,

04:20:50.480 --> 04:20:51.785
that's 25 points of damage.

04:20:51.785 --> 04:20:52.585
Nice!

04:20:52.585 --> 04:20:53.517
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:20:53.517 --> 04:20:54.601
MATT: All right, Caduceus.

04:20:54.601 --> 04:20:55.850
TRAVIS: Nice job, man.

04:20:55.850 --> 04:20:57.130
MATT: That finishes your turn?

04:20:57.130 --> 04:20:58.360
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:20:58.360 --> 04:21:00.140
I can't really do much
for a bonus action,

04:21:00.140 --> 04:21:01.762
so I'm just going to hold there.

04:21:01.762 --> 04:21:02.721
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

04:21:02.721 --> 04:21:04.720
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:21:04.720 --> 04:21:05.640
I would like to rage.

04:21:05.640 --> 04:21:06.440
MATT: All righty.

04:21:06.440 --> 04:21:07.549
TRAVIS: Yes, you would!

04:21:07.549 --> 04:21:09.100
Yes, you would!

04:21:09.100 --> 04:21:12.430
ASHLEY: I'm really,
really, really fucking mad.

04:21:12.430 --> 04:21:13.746
Okay.

04:21:13.746 --> 04:21:16.470
MATT: Skingorger,
or Magician's Judge?

04:21:16.470 --> 04:21:21.140
TALIESIN: Only Skingorger is attuned.

04:21:21.140 --> 04:21:22.150
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:21:22.150 --> 04:21:24.310
Yeah, only Skin--
this was a question.

04:21:24.310 --> 04:21:29.880
Because I wanted to switch
to Magician's Judge because--

04:21:29.880 --> 04:21:31.800
but I can't do it.

04:21:31.800 --> 04:21:34.062
TALIESIN: Would there have
been time on the walk down

04:21:34.062 --> 04:21:35.021
to switch swords or no?

04:21:35.021 --> 04:21:37.670
MATT: It takes a short rest
to attune, unfortunately.

04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:40.738
ASHLEY: Okay, that's fine.

04:21:40.738 --> 04:21:42.295
He's so far up there,
I can't get him.

04:21:42.295 --> 04:21:43.670
TALIESIN: You do have
another target.

04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:44.470
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:21:44.470 --> 04:21:48.140
I'm going to go over to her.

04:21:48.890 --> 04:21:50.135
MATT: Okay.

04:21:51.685 --> 04:21:52.720
SAM: Hit her four times.

04:21:52.720 --> 04:21:55.805
MATT: While Beau
has her grabbed.

04:21:55.805 --> 04:21:57.947
MARISHA: Hit her. Hit her!

04:21:57.947 --> 04:21:58.563
ASHLEY: I'm going to hit her.

04:21:58.563 --> 04:22:00.560
TALIESIN: With a four, too, with a d4.
TRAVIS: Does that give her automatic advantage?

04:22:00.560 --> 04:22:02.777
TALIESIN: And
automatic advantage.

04:22:02.777 --> 04:22:04.006
MATT: No, not against her.

04:22:04.006 --> 04:22:05.090
TALIESIN: Oh, unless you--

04:22:05.090 --> 04:22:07.147
MATT: You have to do reckless
if you want to do advantage.

04:22:07.147 --> 04:22:09.580
TALIESIN: What
if-- strafed her--

04:22:09.580 --> 04:22:11.415
not with the already engaged?

04:22:11.415 --> 04:22:12.790
MATT: Oh, actually with
your movement,

04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:15.208
you could move behind her
if you wanted to do that.

04:22:15.208 --> 04:22:16.900
MARISHA: Flank.
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, absolutely.

04:22:16.900 --> 04:22:17.700
MATT: You can do that.

04:22:17.700 --> 04:22:18.890
ASHLEY: Okay, so I mean--

04:22:18.890 --> 04:22:21.822
TALIESIN: You get
advantage and the d4.

04:22:21.822 --> 04:22:22.961
ASHLEY: 14.

04:22:22.961 --> 04:22:24.295
Oh, I get advantage, and a d4.

04:22:24.295 --> 04:22:27.320
MARISHA: Sentinel babes,
back in the house.

04:22:27.320 --> 04:22:28.330
ASHLEY: Yeah, much better.

04:22:28.330 --> 04:22:29.465
Okay, 20.

04:22:29.465 --> 04:22:32.500
MATT: So what’s the first attack?

04:22:32.500 --> 04:22:33.480
ASHLEY: 24.

04:22:33.480 --> 04:22:34.280
MATT: To hit?

04:22:34.280 --> 04:22:35.440
ASHLEY: To hit.
MATT: To hit?

04:22:35.440 --> 04:22:36.240
All right.

04:22:38.880 --> 04:22:40.950
You strike, and her form blurs.

04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:43.495
(whooshing) And you
Watch now three forms

04:22:43.495 --> 04:22:45.120
of illusory
versions of herself

04:22:45.120 --> 04:22:46.579
that surround and
move through her.

04:22:46.579 --> 04:22:48.700
You strike at one,
and it vanishes.

04:22:48.700 --> 04:22:51.265
So you miss her, but you've
eliminated one of the images.

04:22:51.265 --> 04:22:53.297
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:22:53.297 --> 04:22:54.881
MATT: You can take your second attack.

04:22:54.881 --> 04:22:57.940
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:22:57.940 --> 04:22:59.460
Natural 20.
TRAVIS: Ooh!

04:22:59.460 --> 04:23:00.260
MARISHA: Yes!

04:23:00.260 --> 04:23:01.400
You are on fire!

04:23:01.400 --> 04:23:02.890
MATT: Let's see if this works.

04:23:02.890 --> 04:23:04.208
Fuck!

04:23:04.208 --> 04:23:05.250
All right, no, that hits.

04:23:05.250 --> 04:23:06.710
(laughter)

04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:08.140
TRAVIS: All right, do it.
MATT: All right.

04:23:08.140 --> 04:23:09.015
TRAVIS: Do it slowly.

04:23:09.015 --> 04:23:10.390
MATT: Go ahead and
roll some damage.

04:23:10.390 --> 04:23:11.070
ASHLEY: All right.

04:23:11.070 --> 04:23:12.350
MATT: So this is
your first hit, so it

04:23:12.350 --> 04:23:13.517
does get your additional d6.

04:23:13.517 --> 04:23:15.310
LAURA: Yes!

04:23:15.310 --> 04:23:16.895
MARISHA: Big money!
LAURA: And then double it?

04:23:16.895 --> 04:23:17.770
Is that how it works?

04:23:17.770 --> 04:23:18.570
MATT: Yeah.

04:23:18.570 --> 04:23:20.220
TRAVIS: Roll the dice.

04:23:20.220 --> 04:23:21.572
TALIESIN: And you
can reroll ones?

04:23:21.572 --> 04:23:22.598
ASHLEY: I think I can
reroll all of them.

04:23:22.598 --> 04:23:23.577
MATT: You can reroll
one of the dice.

04:23:23.577 --> 04:23:24.653
LAURA and ASHLEY: One of the dice?

04:23:24.653 --> 04:23:26.070
MATT: Hold on,
let's double check.

04:23:26.070 --> 04:23:27.778
ASHLEY: I think I can
reroll all of them,

04:23:27.778 --> 04:23:28.820
and then take the higher.

04:23:28.820 --> 04:23:30.740
TRAVIS: I think it's just one.

04:23:30.740 --> 04:23:32.160
ASHLEY: You think it's just one?

04:23:32.160 --> 04:23:34.530
MATT: Reroll the weapon’s
damage dice, so weapon’s.

04:23:34.530 --> 04:23:38.904
You can reroll the one d12.

04:23:38.904 --> 04:23:40.455
LAURA: Reroll that three.

04:23:40.455 --> 04:23:43.331
TRAVIS: She's not doing
12, she's doing the 3d6.

04:23:43.331 --> 04:23:44.131
LAURA: No, she's
doing two twelves.

04:23:44.131 --> 04:23:44.931
TRAVIS: Oh, is she?
LAURA: Yeah.

04:23:44.931 --> 04:23:45.665
TRAVIS: Oh.

04:23:46.626 --> 04:23:48.797
MATT: Well, for the Brutal
Critical, she has that.

04:23:48.797 --> 04:23:49.630
TALIESIN: Didn’t change anything.

04:23:49.630 --> 04:23:50.430
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:23:50.430 --> 04:23:51.897
So shit, what was
this one, a four?

04:23:51.897 --> 04:23:52.981
LAURA: It was a four, yeah.

04:23:52.981 --> 04:23:56.930
ASHLEY: Okay, so
seven, eight, so 16.

04:23:56.930 --> 04:23:57.730
MATT: Plus?

04:23:57.730 --> 04:24:01.075
ASHLEY: Plus-- I think it's--

04:24:01.075 --> 04:24:02.426
TALIESIN: Been a while!

04:24:02.426 --> 04:24:03.300
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:24:03.300 --> 04:24:05.348
MATT: Getting the rust off.

04:24:06.236 --> 04:24:09.210
But we got your back.

04:24:09.210 --> 04:24:10.400
ASHLEY: 23 points of damage.

04:24:10.400 --> 04:24:11.240
MATT: Woo!

04:24:11.240 --> 04:24:13.740
ASHLEY: So before I do that, I
want to look at her and say--

04:24:13.740 --> 04:24:16.238
MATT: You added your
Brutal Critical, right?

04:24:16.238 --> 04:24:18.776
TRAVIS: You roll one
more damage dice.

04:24:18.776 --> 04:24:19.610
ASHLEY: Another one?

04:24:19.610 --> 04:24:20.600
LAURA: Another d12.

04:24:20.600 --> 04:24:21.420
MATT: Mm-hmm.

04:24:21.420 --> 04:24:22.300
ASHLEY: Another d12?

04:24:22.300 --> 04:24:23.300
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

04:24:23.300 --> 04:24:25.537
TRAVIS: And at this level--
ASHLEY: I've been rolling sixes.

04:24:25.537 --> 04:24:26.662
TRAVIS: Are you 10th level?

04:24:26.662 --> 04:24:27.720
ASHLEY: Wait, no.

04:24:27.720 --> 04:24:30.800
My weapon is only sixes.

04:24:30.800 --> 04:24:32.480
These look like 12s
because they're--

04:24:32.480 --> 04:24:33.405
MATT: Oh!

04:24:33.405 --> 04:24:34.955
I see.

04:24:34.955 --> 04:24:37.043
ASHLEY: No, they're weird.

04:24:37.043 --> 04:24:38.470
LAURA: Oh, they're confusing?
ASHLEY: Yeah, they're confusing.

04:24:38.470 --> 04:24:40.070
MATT: So your roll
an additional d6.

04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:42.206
ASHLEY: I roll and
additional d6, okay.

04:24:42.206 --> 04:24:43.060
I was like, wait.

04:24:43.060 --> 04:24:44.144
MATT: For Brutal Critical.

04:24:44.144 --> 04:24:45.560
ASHLEY: Okay, an extra three.

04:24:45.560 --> 04:24:47.348
LAURA: Times two, so six.

04:24:47.348 --> 04:24:48.390
ASHLEY: Times to, so six.

04:24:48.390 --> 04:24:50.040
MATT: So 29 points of damage.

04:24:50.040 --> 04:24:50.840
Nice.

04:24:50.840 --> 04:24:54.100
TALIESIN: Did you get anything
else out of a critical as

04:24:54.100 --> 04:24:55.065
raging barbarian?

04:24:55.065 --> 04:25:01.890
MATT: Well, she gets to do
additional damage, which--

04:25:01.890 --> 04:25:04.352
yeah, so that's that there.

04:25:04.352 --> 04:25:05.152
Okay.

04:25:05.152 --> 04:25:07.800
ASHLEY: Before I do that,
I want to look at her,

04:25:07.800 --> 04:25:11.640
and just look her
in the eyes and say:

04:25:11.640 --> 04:25:14.500
You can have control
over your mind.

04:25:14.500 --> 04:25:16.405
Fight it.

04:25:16.405 --> 04:25:19.840
MATT: You look in the
face, and you can like--

04:25:19.840 --> 04:25:22.130
she's under the same
influence you've been.

04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:25.060
TRAVIS: So she's-- does she
have a fucking glowing orange?

04:25:25.060 --> 04:25:27.497
ASHLEY: I tried to say that loud
enough so people could hear.

04:25:27.497 --> 04:25:29.080
MATT: That's loud
enough, that's fine.

04:25:29.080 --> 04:25:30.350
TRAVIS: You going to do that?

04:25:30.350 --> 04:25:31.560
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

04:25:31.560 --> 04:25:33.610
I already knew that thing. I know those.

04:25:33.610 --> 04:25:36.900
MATT: Finishing Yasha's
turn, it is Obann's turn.

04:25:36.900 --> 04:25:38.090
Obann--

04:25:38.090 --> 04:25:39.590
LAURA: I've been
scrying on them.

04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:45.610
MATT: -- is going to go ahead and
shift over this way, and

04:25:45.610 --> 04:25:47.910
glance over in
your direction,

04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:49.450
as you're the one
who Faerie Fired.

04:25:49.450 --> 04:25:50.515
TRAVIS: Hello!

04:25:50.515 --> 04:25:54.165
MATT: He says, "Hello,
would you do me a favor?"

04:25:54.165 --> 04:25:55.290
Make a wisdom saving throw.

04:25:55.290 --> 04:25:57.386
TALIESIN: With a d4.

04:25:57.386 --> 04:26:00.732
TRAVIS: (humming)

04:26:06.468 --> 04:26:07.966
TRAVIS: 13.

04:26:07.966 --> 04:26:10.070
MATT: You are dominated.

04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:11.620
Fjord, you are charmed.

04:26:11.620 --> 04:26:12.580
Sorry, I mean charmed.

04:26:17.311 --> 04:26:18.895
And he's going to
point at the circle.

04:26:18.895 --> 04:26:19.820
LAURA: No!

04:26:19.820 --> 04:26:21.904
MATT: So your command is
to go step into a circle.

04:26:24.490 --> 04:26:26.350
All right.

04:26:26.350 --> 04:26:29.200
That brings us to Jester.

04:26:36.470 --> 04:26:38.103
LAURA: Fuck.

04:26:38.103 --> 04:26:39.020
I was focused on that.

04:26:39.020 --> 04:26:46.430
I'm going to try to cast at
4th-level, Dispel Magic.

04:26:46.430 --> 04:26:48.052
That's all I've got 4th-level.

04:26:48.052 --> 04:26:49.460
MATT: On?

04:26:49.460 --> 04:26:53.045
LAURA: It probably need
to be 5th-level on her.

04:26:54.465 --> 04:26:57.480
I'm trying to cast Dispel Magic
on the Inevitable End.

04:26:58.190 --> 04:26:58.990
MATT: Okay.

04:26:58.990 --> 04:27:00.660
You do not see.

04:27:00.660 --> 04:27:02.590
LAURA: I know she has
the thing, because I've

04:27:02.590 --> 04:27:03.520
been scrying on them.

04:27:03.520 --> 04:27:04.970
MATT: Oh, that's
true, you would.

04:27:04.970 --> 04:27:05.770
LAURA: Yeah.

04:27:05.770 --> 04:27:06.570
MATT: You would.

04:27:06.570 --> 04:27:08.260
You'd have to move
to get a better view,

04:27:08.260 --> 04:27:09.920
but you can do that if you want.

04:27:09.920 --> 04:27:12.820
Yeah, so one, two,
three, four, five.

04:27:12.820 --> 04:27:16.070
You'd have to get into the
circle to be able to see her,

04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:17.320
based on how she's being held.

04:27:17.320 --> 04:27:20.196
LAURA: Jesus!

04:27:20.196 --> 04:27:23.261
MATT: But you'd
have a view of it.

04:27:23.261 --> 04:27:24.470
MATT: What do you want to do?

04:27:24.470 --> 04:27:26.206
TALIESIN: Do you have
any movement left?

04:27:26.206 --> 04:27:28.039
LAURA: Would I have any
movement after that?

04:27:28.039 --> 04:27:28.796
MATT: No.

04:27:28.796 --> 04:27:29.757
It takes all your
movement to get--

04:27:29.757 --> 04:27:31.350
LAURA: I'm doing it.
MATT: You're doing it?

04:27:31.350 --> 04:27:32.150
All right.

04:27:32.150 --> 04:27:33.650
So you step forward
into the circle.

04:27:33.650 --> 04:27:35.960
And it's strange, as you
step into the one,

04:27:35.960 --> 04:27:37.707
you feel like this cold come over you.

04:27:37.707 --> 04:27:38.802
And you step out of
that first circle,

04:27:38.802 --> 04:27:40.500
you step into the one
on the opposite end.

04:27:40.500 --> 04:27:42.083
And as you get ready,
you can lean in,

04:27:42.083 --> 04:27:44.110
and you can see as Beau
is grasping her throat,

04:27:44.110 --> 04:27:45.860
and Yasha is with her
behind and striking,

04:27:45.860 --> 04:27:47.228
and she's
looking around.

04:27:47.228 --> 04:27:49.520
Eyes darting wildly, she
turns back towards Beauregard.

04:27:49.520 --> 04:27:51.854
And on the back of the neck,
right beneath the red hair,

04:27:51.854 --> 04:27:54.830
you can see the
faint orange glow.

04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:58.280
You can feel the cold of
the circle causing all

04:27:58.280 --> 04:27:59.998
of your skin to get goosebumps.

04:27:59.998 --> 04:28:01.560
And your heart
sinks in your chest.

04:28:01.560 --> 04:28:02.572
LAURA: I embrace the cold.

04:28:02.572 --> 04:28:04.510
MATT: Okay, and you cast it
at 4th-level, you said?

04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:05.310
LAURA: Yeah.

04:28:05.310 --> 04:28:08.150
MATT: Go ahead
roll a d20 for me.

04:28:08.150 --> 04:28:09.620
Bless is not ability
checks, right?

04:28:09.620 --> 04:28:11.556
LAURA: Yeah.

04:28:14.404 --> 04:28:15.912
(sighing)

04:28:15.912 --> 04:28:18.400
LAURA: Why am I cursed?

04:28:19.360 --> 04:28:21.775
A two plus whatever.

04:28:21.775 --> 04:28:26.130
MATT: Unfortunately, the
dispel does not land.

04:28:26.130 --> 04:28:28.270
LAURA: Damn it.

04:28:28.270 --> 04:28:31.406
LIAM: You’re so bad at D&amp;D.
LAURA: I'm so fucking bad at D&amp;D.

04:28:31.406 --> 04:28:33.160
SAM: Nominee for best actress.

04:28:33.160 --> 04:28:35.000
MATT: No, that was a
great fucking maneuver.

04:28:35.000 --> 04:28:35.800
LIAM: Yeah.

04:28:35.800 --> 04:28:36.880
MATT: Just a shitty die.

04:28:36.880 --> 04:28:38.090
MARISHA: It sucks.

04:28:38.090 --> 04:28:40.340
MATT: All right, that's your
action and your movement.

04:28:40.340 --> 04:28:42.446
You have a bonus still.

04:28:42.446 --> 04:28:43.960
LAURA: As a bonus action--

04:28:43.960 --> 04:28:50.020
I can't cast another spell,
so I'm just going to go: Fuck!

04:28:50.020 --> 04:28:51.570
MATT: Okay.

04:28:51.570 --> 04:28:54.950
All right, that
finishes Jester's turn.

04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:55.930
Beau, you're up.

04:28:55.930 --> 04:28:57.570
Nott, you're on deck.

04:28:57.570 --> 04:28:59.215
LIAM: Go ham.

04:28:59.215 --> 04:29:00.590
MARISHA: I got
her by the throat?

04:29:00.590 --> 04:29:01.424
SAM: Kill this girl?

04:29:01.424 --> 04:29:02.620
MATT: Mm-hmm.

04:29:02.620 --> 04:29:04.310
MARISHA: Whack! Whack!

04:29:04.310 --> 04:29:05.640
(laughter)

04:29:05.640 --> 04:29:06.440
Fucking wall.

04:29:06.440 --> 04:29:07.550
MATT: Go for it.

04:29:07.550 --> 04:29:08.350
TRAVIS: Love it.

04:29:10.545 --> 04:29:12.855
MARISHA: Let me try it first
at first attack, first roll.

04:29:12.855 --> 04:29:14.170
MATT: You do have
advantage on these attacks,

04:29:14.170 --> 04:29:15.650
because you and Yasha are--

04:29:15.650 --> 04:29:16.450
MARISHA: Flanking.

04:29:16.450 --> 04:29:17.490
TALIESIN: Plus d4.

04:29:17.490 --> 04:29:19.215
MARISHA: Hey, I'll take that 28.

04:29:19.215 --> 04:29:20.580
MATT: That definitely hits.

04:29:20.580 --> 04:29:22.040
MARISHA: Plus three, 31.

04:29:22.040 --> 04:29:22.890
MATT: 31.

04:29:22.890 --> 04:29:26.290
(whooshing) You destroy
another one of the images.

04:29:26.290 --> 04:29:30.471
MARISHA: Okay, second attack.

04:29:30.471 --> 04:29:32.550
So almost a natural 20.

04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:33.350
26.

04:29:33.350 --> 04:29:35.420
MATT: Definitely hits.

04:29:35.420 --> 04:29:36.220
Hits her.

04:29:36.220 --> 04:29:37.460
MARISHA: 27, 28 total?

04:29:37.460 --> 04:29:38.260
MATT: Yep.

04:29:38.260 --> 04:29:41.110
MARISHA: With the-- hits her?

04:29:41.110 --> 04:29:42.900
12 damage.

04:29:42.900 --> 04:29:43.780
Stunning Strike.

04:29:43.780 --> 04:29:44.840
MATT: Stunning Strike.

04:29:48.535 --> 04:29:49.660
TALIESIN: But they run out.

04:29:49.660 --> 04:29:51.285
MARISHA: I'm focusing
on her, because--

04:29:51.285 --> 04:29:52.085
MATT: 19.

04:29:52.085 --> 04:29:53.884
MARISHA: (whispering)
Fucking bitch.

04:29:57.325 --> 04:29:58.225
Goddamn it.

04:29:58.225 --> 04:30:00.244
SAM: I guess we focus on her?
LAURA: She can't be killed.

04:30:00.244 --> 04:30:03.100
That’s the thing that Yasha said.
All of them can't be killed.

04:30:03.100 --> 04:30:05.433
TALIESIN: We get rid of that
if we ever-- if Obann does,

04:30:05.433 --> 04:30:07.466
then it's fine.

04:30:07.466 --> 04:30:10.240
MARISHA: Just
trying to stun her.

04:30:10.240 --> 04:30:11.740
MATT: You still
have a bonus action still.

04:30:11.740 --> 04:30:12.870
LAURA: He just came back.

04:30:16.315 --> 04:30:18.940
MARISHA: (whispering) Oh my god,
I'm running out of ki points.

04:30:22.030 --> 04:30:23.220
Flurry of Blows.

04:30:23.220 --> 04:30:25.768
MATT: Go for it.

04:30:25.768 --> 04:30:26.702
MARISHA:: First pop.

04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:31.566
24.

04:30:31.566 --> 04:30:32.510
MATT: Hits her.

04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:34.850
MARISHA: Plus four, 28.

04:30:34.850 --> 04:30:37.950
MATT: Rolling real shitty
on her Mirror Image rolls.

04:30:37.950 --> 04:30:38.750
MARISHA: 10 damage.

04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:41.694
MATT: 10 damage, all righty.

04:30:41.694 --> 04:30:44.530
And you have one more
attack in Flurry of Blows.

04:30:47.170 --> 04:30:48.660
Unless you're doing
something else.

04:30:48.660 --> 04:30:51.100
MARISHA: She rolled
a 19 on her save?

04:30:51.100 --> 04:30:52.759
MATT: She did.

04:31:01.872 --> 04:31:06.110
MARISHA: 22 plus-- 26.

04:31:06.110 --> 04:31:07.270
MATT: That hits.

04:31:07.270 --> 04:31:09.540
Four, roll four, roll
of four, roll of four.

04:31:09.540 --> 04:31:11.045
I keep fucking rolling fours.

04:31:11.045 --> 04:31:11.845
All right.

04:31:11.845 --> 04:31:13.800
MARISHA: Another 10 damage.
MATT: Another 10 damage.

04:31:13.800 --> 04:31:14.600
All right.

04:31:14.600 --> 04:31:16.080
MARISHA: Extract Aspects.

04:31:16.080 --> 04:31:17.640
MATT: Okay.

04:31:17.640 --> 04:31:26.866
She is resistant to acid, fire,
lightning, cold, and thunder.

04:31:26.866 --> 04:31:28.110
MARISHA: Dang!

04:31:28.110 --> 04:31:31.780
MATT: As well as piercing, slashing, and
bludgeoning from non-magical.

04:31:31.780 --> 04:31:32.680
MARISHA: Non-magic.

04:31:32.680 --> 04:31:35.215
MATT: She is immune to poison.

04:31:35.215 --> 04:31:36.590
TALIESIN: Makes sense.

04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:38.920
MATT: She cannot be frightened.

04:31:38.920 --> 04:31:41.050
She cannot be grappled.

04:31:41.050 --> 04:31:43.280
She cannot be paralyzed.

04:31:43.280 --> 04:31:48.241
She cannot be poisoned, or
made prone, or restrained.

04:31:48.241 --> 04:31:52.250
SAM: Oh, so Stunning Strike
wouldn't have worked anyway.

04:31:52.250 --> 04:31:54.130
MATT: No, she's
not immune to stun.

04:31:54.130 --> 04:31:57.640
MARISHA: She can't get
grappled, prone, or restrained,

04:31:57.640 --> 04:31:59.130
frightened, poisoned.

04:31:59.130 --> 04:32:01.390
She's immune to non-magic or paralyzed.

04:32:01.390 --> 04:32:02.603
Right?
Did you say paralyzed?

04:32:02.603 --> 04:32:03.520
MATT: Yeah, paralyzed.

04:32:03.520 --> 04:32:04.690
She's immuned to paralyzed.

04:32:04.690 --> 04:32:08.155
MARISHA: Paralyzed,
immune to acid--

04:32:08.155 --> 04:32:08.955
or no, resistant.

04:32:08.955 --> 04:32:09.872
MATT: Resistant, yeah.

04:32:09.872 --> 04:32:12.970
MARISHA: To acid,
fire, lightning, cold.

04:32:17.880 --> 04:32:18.970
Shit.

04:32:18.970 --> 04:32:20.760
I'm going to do a
shout out and say:

04:32:20.760 --> 04:32:28.700
Think necrotic and holy on this girl.

04:32:28.700 --> 04:32:32.230
It's all you can really do.

04:32:32.230 --> 04:32:33.615
SAM: Cool.
MARISHA: It's what I say.

04:32:33.615 --> 04:32:34.415
MATT: All right.

04:32:34.415 --> 04:32:35.215
SAM: Obann?

04:32:35.215 --> 04:32:36.600
MATT: Does that
finish your turn?

04:32:36.600 --> 04:32:37.546
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

04:32:37.546 --> 04:32:39.030
MATT: Okay, Beau's done.

04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:42.192
Nott, you're up,
Caleb, you're on deck.

04:32:42.192 --> 04:32:43.510
SAM: How high up is he?

04:32:43.510 --> 04:32:44.310
MATT: 50 feet.

04:32:44.310 --> 04:32:45.451
SAM: Oh man!

04:32:45.451 --> 04:32:47.120
I'm going to have disadvantage
on the shot anyway.

04:32:47.120 --> 04:32:49.218
TALIESIN: No, it's going to
be cleared out, because he had

04:32:49.218 --> 04:32:50.510
all of his attacks have advantage.

04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:52.260
SAM: I know, but I
won't get sneak attack.

04:32:52.260 --> 04:32:56.370
So in that case, I'm going
to fire on what's her name.

04:32:56.370 --> 04:33:00.760
MARISHA: I'm running
out of shit to do, too.

04:33:00.760 --> 04:33:02.970
SAM: Unless--

04:33:04.796 --> 04:33:07.019
TRAVIS: Explode the crystal.

04:33:07.019 --> 04:33:08.619
Release the--
SAM: What?

04:33:08.619 --> 04:33:10.954
What? That's an option?

04:33:10.954 --> 04:33:14.130
TALIESIN: Eh, don't do that.

04:33:14.130 --> 04:33:15.800
SAM: Balls.

04:33:15.800 --> 04:33:17.500
Balls, balls,
balls, balls, balls.

04:33:17.500 --> 04:33:19.600
MATT: What are you doing, Nott?
SAM: Man!

04:33:19.600 --> 04:33:23.369
I wish I could do more
than just cast a spell.

04:33:23.369 --> 04:33:25.110
I guess I'll take
her out, right?

04:33:25.110 --> 04:33:27.156
Would that help?

04:33:27.156 --> 04:33:30.029
ASHLEY: He also has advantage--

04:33:30.029 --> 04:33:31.490
SAM: She's resistant to--

04:33:31.490 --> 04:33:33.740
TALIESIN: Everything except
for necrotic--

04:33:33.740 --> 04:33:37.990
MARISHA: Acid, fire, lightning, cold, 
thunder, non-magical weapons.

04:33:38.005 --> 04:33:39.992
SAM: Piercing?
LAURA: No, you can pierce her.

04:33:39.992 --> 04:33:42.823
SAM: Oh, okay. Well, then I will shoot her.
MARISHA: As long as it's-- because it's magical.

04:33:42.823 --> 04:33:44.790
SAM: Yeah, I will shoot her.
MATT: Go for it.

04:33:44.790 --> 04:33:46.284
Roll for an attack.

04:33:46.284 --> 04:33:47.084
SAM: 13.

04:33:47.084 --> 04:33:48.312
MATT: 13 misses.
SAM: Bonus action.

04:33:48.312 --> 04:33:50.849
TALIESIN: Wait. But you get an advantage?
LAURA: Plus four.

04:33:50.849 --> 04:33:51.987
TALIESIN: No, if you're Blessed.

04:33:51.987 --> 04:33:55.410
MATT: But you're not Blessed.
TALIESIN: You are Blessed.

04:33:55.410 --> 04:33:56.980
SAM: Still only 14.

04:33:56.980 --> 04:33:58.329
LAURA: And we're flanking her.

04:33:58.329 --> 04:34:00.063
TALIESIN: So you get advantage.
LAURA: You get advantage.

04:34:00.063 --> 04:34:02.530
MARISHA: You get advantage.
SAM: You do? Okay.

04:34:02.530 --> 04:34:04.020
Is that true?

04:34:04.020 --> 04:34:04.930
Hey, that's 27.

04:34:04.930 --> 04:34:07.459
MATT: Actually, no. Nott was not blessed, 
because Nott was not in the room.

04:34:07.459 --> 04:34:08.709
LAURA: Yeah, Nott was Blessed.

04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:11.639
TALIESIN: Wait, it was within 30 feet.
When we walked in, we did everybody.

04:34:11.639 --> 04:34:13.239
MATT: Oh right, Okay. All right.

04:34:13.239 --> 04:34:14.681
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:34:14.681 --> 04:34:16.849
SAM: And I get advantage?

04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:19.319
LIAM: Does Nott get advantage in this?

04:34:19.319 --> 04:34:21.000
MATT: Against her?
LIAM: Yeah.

04:34:21.000 --> 04:34:24.100
MATT: No, you don't get advantage,
but you do get sneak attack damage if you hit.

04:34:24.100 --> 04:34:25.980
SAM: I didn't hit, so 14.
So that didn't hit.

04:34:25.980 --> 04:34:27.980
Next roll is a 24 to hit.

04:34:27.980 --> 04:34:29.740
MATT: 24 to hit.

04:34:29.740 --> 04:34:30.750
There we go!

04:34:30.750 --> 04:34:32.375
LIAM: One to connect,
that's all I need.

04:34:32.375 --> 04:34:35.820
MATT: You shoot the last of
the images, and it vanishes.

04:34:35.820 --> 04:34:37.259
It absorbs the final blow.

04:34:37.259 --> 04:34:39.960
But now all of the mirror
images have vanished,

04:34:39.960 --> 04:34:41.559
and she is definitely there.

04:34:41.559 --> 04:34:42.933
SAM: Okay.

04:34:42.933 --> 04:34:44.730
TRAVIS: For as long as she is there.

04:34:44.730 --> 04:34:46.840
SAM: Then I'll just
move that way 15 feet.

04:34:46.840 --> 04:34:49.226
MATT: 15 feet.

04:34:49.226 --> 04:34:51.779
That finishes your turn, Nott. Caleb, you're up.

04:34:51.779 --> 04:34:56.430
LIAM: I start to wander in,
looking at Fjord a little anxiously.

04:34:56.430 --> 04:34:59.340
And I'm going to move to
the column closest to me.

04:34:59.340 --> 04:35:01.236
MATT: Okay, right here?

04:35:01.236 --> 04:35:04.290
LIAM: And fire just
springs up in my hand,

04:35:04.290 --> 04:35:08.910
and I just huck a Fire Bolt at Obann.

04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:11.294
MATT: Go for it. You have 
advantage on the attack roll.

04:35:11.294 --> 04:35:12.094
SAM: Fire Bolt.

04:35:12.094 --> 04:35:15.565
TALIESIN: No, I think they're resistant to fire.
LAURA: Yeah, he's resistant.

04:35:17.881 --> 04:35:20.630
LIAM: I'm still doing it, because 
I have nothing else I can do.

04:35:20.630 --> 04:35:24.924
It definitely hits, I
rolled at 19, plus nine, 27.

04:35:24.924 --> 04:35:26.680
MATT: 27 hits.

04:35:26.680 --> 04:35:29.926
LIAM: And it's just 2d10.

04:35:29.926 --> 04:35:32.180
I will know after
this that he can't be hurt.

04:35:32.180 --> 04:35:33.390
Nine of fire.

04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:34.640
MATT: Nine points fire damage.

04:35:34.640 --> 04:35:36.535
Reduced to half
because he’s resistant.

04:35:36.535 --> 04:35:39.430
So (whooshing) gets the
hit, seems to shrug it off,

04:35:39.430 --> 04:35:40.230
no issue.

04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:44.439
TRAVIS: Not something he has
to maintain on old Fjordy boy?

04:35:44.439 --> 04:35:45.576
MATT: Nope.

04:35:45.576 --> 04:35:46.849
SAM: Fjordy boy.

04:35:46.849 --> 04:35:48.270
LIAM: I will
actually stand just--

04:35:48.270 --> 04:35:50.162
could I go just
outside that circle?

04:35:50.162 --> 04:35:51.954
MATT: Right there?
LIAM: Yeah, right there.

04:35:51.954 --> 04:35:53.369
MATT: There you go.
LIAM: Okay.

04:35:53.369 --> 04:35:54.509
MATT: All righty.

04:35:54.509 --> 04:35:57.759
That brings us to the
Caedogeist's turn.

04:35:57.759 --> 04:35:59.480
The Caedogeist--

04:36:02.827 --> 04:36:05.791
It's going to go ahead and take
attempt cast Darkness in her space.

04:36:05.791 --> 04:36:07.939
SAM: Ooh.

04:36:07.939 --> 04:36:09.515
Metal!

04:36:10.455 --> 04:36:16.390
MATT: Create an area of
magical darkness in this area.

04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:20.290
So as she does so,
(whooshing) this black sphere

04:36:20.290 --> 04:36:21.700
envelops the area.

04:36:21.700 --> 04:36:23.814
Both Yasha and Beauregard
can see nothing.

04:36:23.814 --> 04:36:25.314
You are engulfed
in magical darkness

04:36:25.314 --> 04:36:28.029
that your eyes cannot pierce.

04:36:28.029 --> 04:36:30.756
She then attempts to
shift into the wall.

04:36:30.756 --> 04:36:33.340
Both of you guys get attacks of
opportunity with disadvantage.

04:36:33.340 --> 04:36:35.975
MARISHA: Oh man!
Come on, Sentinel babes!

04:36:35.975 --> 04:36:38.260
ASHLEY: Come on, Sentinel babes.

04:36:38.260 --> 04:36:40.270
TALIESIN: Add the d4 just case.

04:36:46.528 --> 04:36:48.520
ASHLEY: Oh, disadvantage?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

04:36:48.520 --> 04:36:49.320
ASHLEY: Fuck.

04:36:49.320 --> 04:36:51.400
I rolled another natural 20.

04:36:51.400 --> 04:36:55.200
Okay, so 17.

04:36:55.200 --> 04:36:56.575
MATT: 17 misses.

04:36:56.575 --> 04:36:57.860
LAURA: Did you add a d4?

04:36:57.860 --> 04:37:00.340
ASHLEY: I did, yeah.

04:37:00.340 --> 04:37:01.969
SAM: Gone!
MATT: Vanishes.

04:37:01.969 --> 04:37:04.219
SAM: Does the darkness go
with her, or it stays there?

04:37:04.219 --> 04:37:06.380
MATT: No, the darkness stays.

04:37:06.380 --> 04:37:08.890
All right. She moves up. That's her turn.

04:37:08.890 --> 04:37:09.800
Fjord, you're up.

04:37:09.800 --> 04:37:12.096
TRAVIS: (singing)
I think we're alone now.

04:37:12.096 --> 04:37:14.349
MATT: Fjord steps
into the circle,

04:37:14.349 --> 04:37:19.519
and the cold (whooshing)
washes over you.

04:37:19.519 --> 04:37:21.810
Finishes your turn.

04:37:21.810 --> 04:37:23.060
TRAVIS: I'm dominated, right?

04:37:23.060 --> 04:37:25.679
TALIESIN: You don't get to
attempt to save against it?

04:37:27.686 --> 04:37:31.419
SAM: Because he was just told to 
go in the circle, not kill any of us, right?

04:37:31.419 --> 04:37:33.070
MATT: Nope.

04:37:33.070 --> 04:37:36.240
Nope, no save.

04:37:36.240 --> 04:37:38.040
All right.

04:37:38.040 --> 04:37:40.965
That brings us to Caduceus.

04:37:40.965 --> 04:37:42.695
And Yasha’s on deck.

04:37:42.695 --> 04:37:45.930
TALIESIN: I'm going
to walk up to Fjord.

04:37:45.930 --> 04:37:49.470
And fuck it, I'm--

04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:51.810
no one die, okay?

04:37:51.810 --> 04:37:54.150
I'm going to cast Greater
Restoration on Fjord.

04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:56.520
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Yes! Yes!

04:37:56.520 --> 04:37:58.050
MATT: All right.

04:37:58.050 --> 04:37:59.710
TALIESIN: So he is
no longer charmed.

04:37:59.710 --> 04:38:01.050
MATT: He is no longer charmed.

04:38:01.050 --> 04:38:02.550
TALIESIN: And I'm
going to grab him.

04:38:02.550 --> 04:38:05.180
I'm going to take his hand.

04:38:05.180 --> 04:38:08.162
And I'm going to pull him out of the circle 
and say, come with me.

04:38:08.162 --> 04:38:10.480
MATT: You can't, because you used 
your action to cast the spell.

04:38:10.480 --> 04:38:11.740
TALIESIN: That was my action.
MATT: Right.

04:38:11.740 --> 04:38:13.800
TALIESIN: My bonus can't be
come with me, and drag him?

04:38:13.800 --> 04:38:14.541
MATT: No.

04:38:14.541 --> 04:38:17.368
To forcefully pull somebody
and push them out of the space

04:38:17.368 --> 04:38:21.480
is either part of an ability
or an action to do so.

04:38:21.480 --> 04:38:23.497
To do that-- to cast the
spell and then pull him out--

04:38:23.497 --> 04:38:25.080
he's still
recovering from it.

04:38:25.080 --> 04:38:26.414
You can't do both in this round.

04:38:26.414 --> 04:38:27.762
TRAVIS: Hi, Caduceus.

04:38:27.762 --> 04:38:30.040
TALIESIN: Get out of the
circle as soon as possible.

04:38:30.040 --> 04:38:32.582
I'm going to back the
hell back up against the wall.

04:38:32.582 --> 04:38:33.382
MATT: Okay.

04:38:33.382 --> 04:38:36.720
TALIESIN: And I don't think I have 
any other shit that I can do.

04:38:38.880 --> 04:38:39.840
Yeah.

04:38:42.689 --> 04:38:47.033
No, just for-- yeah, no that's--

04:38:47.033 --> 04:38:48.303
yep, that's what I can do.

04:38:48.303 --> 04:38:51.014
MATT: All right, that finishes Caduceus. 
Yasha, you're up.

04:38:51.014 --> 04:38:51.962
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:38:51.962 --> 04:38:53.992
MATT: You're just covered
in darkness right now.

04:38:53.992 --> 04:38:55.701
The Caedogeist slipped
out of your grasp.

04:38:55.701 --> 04:38:57.590
Your blade hit the
side of the wall.

04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:59.440
No actual impact. What do you do?

04:38:59.440 --> 04:39:00.590
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:05.823
I'm going to try to back
out of the circle, if I can.

04:39:05.823 --> 04:39:07.740
MATT: And you moved five
feet, and your vision

04:39:07.740 --> 04:39:09.020
comes back to you.
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:39:09.020 --> 04:39:10.481
So, um...

04:39:13.231 --> 04:39:15.251
I'd like to go beside Jester.

04:39:15.251 --> 04:39:17.229
MATT: Okay, move over.

04:39:17.229 --> 04:39:19.120
SAM: (Irish accent) I'd like to
move beside Jester.

04:39:19.120 --> 04:39:20.431
Holy shit!

04:39:20.431 --> 04:39:22.355
(laughter)

04:39:22.355 --> 04:39:24.279
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

04:39:24.279 --> 04:39:25.241
(laughter)

04:39:25.241 --> 04:39:27.213
MATT: You'll get the
joke in two years.

04:39:27.213 --> 04:39:28.900
(laughter)

04:39:28.900 --> 04:39:31.654
Year and a half.

04:39:31.654 --> 04:39:34.385
ASHLEY: Jester, do you
think you can get out there?

04:39:34.385 --> 04:39:36.990
LAURA: Sure, yes--
sure, yeah.

04:39:36.990 --> 04:39:37.910
ASHLEY: You think so?

04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:40.448
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

04:39:41.258 --> 04:39:42.230
ASHLEY: Fuck.

04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:45.100
I don't know what to do, because
I can't reach him up there.

04:39:47.144 --> 04:39:51.475
LAURA: You can hold your
attack until he's within reach.

04:39:51.475 --> 04:39:53.618
TALIESIN: You can hold on attack
until <i>anything's</i> within reach.

04:39:53.618 --> 04:39:56.757
LAURA: You can get up underneath him,
and then hold your attack if he comes down

04:39:56.757 --> 04:40:00.390
to the ground or something?
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:03.415
All right, I'll just get
close to where he is.

04:40:03.415 --> 04:40:05.780
MATT: Okay.

04:40:05.780 --> 04:40:06.815
Over here. That’s five, 10, 15.
SAM: (yawns)

04:40:06.815 --> 04:40:09.383
SAM: (yawns)
LAURA: I know, it’s late!

04:40:09.383 --> 04:40:11.050
MARISHA: Long game.
SAM: Is anybody packed?

04:40:11.050 --> 04:40:12.640
LAURA and MARISHA: Nope.
LIAM: Yes.

04:40:12.640 --> 04:40:14.524
SAM: You did?
LIAM: That's what I did today.

04:40:14.524 --> 04:40:17.781
ASHLEY: And try to taunt him
to come down a little closer.

04:40:17.781 --> 04:40:21.280
MATT: Okay, you're just
going to intimidate him?

04:40:21.280 --> 04:40:22.545
ASHLEY: Sure.

04:40:22.545 --> 04:40:25.180
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll 
an intimidation check.

04:40:28.020 --> 04:40:32.735
ASHLEY: I can use my
strength with that, right?

04:40:32.735 --> 04:40:33.860
MATT: I'll let you do that.

04:40:33.860 --> 04:40:35.740
ASHLEY: Because I think
we talked about that?

04:40:35.740 --> 04:40:39.310
MATT: Yeah, that's one of
the variant rules I’m allowing.

04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:41.480
ASHLEY: Oh boy!

04:40:41.480 --> 04:40:42.390
Six.

04:40:42.390 --> 04:40:44.160
LAURA: Oh, yeah.
MATT: He's unfazed.

04:40:44.160 --> 04:40:46.340
He looks down at
you and goes, (laughs).

04:40:46.340 --> 04:40:47.868
TALIESIN: You got to hold
attack for the next thing--

04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:49.942
ASHLEY: I'm still scared of
him a little bit, you know?

04:40:49.942 --> 04:40:52.968
It's going take a minute
for me to get my courage

04:40:52.968 --> 04:40:54.343
MATT: All right.
SAM: It's a lot.

04:40:54.343 --> 04:40:55.740
MATT: It is now Obann's turn.

04:40:55.740 --> 04:40:58.370
Obann goes, "Here,
I'll do you one more."

04:40:58.370 --> 04:40:59.306
ASHLEY: No.

04:40:59.306 --> 04:41:02.100
MATT: He flies down and
enters the circle next to you.

04:41:02.100 --> 04:41:04.536
LAURA: Oh no! Can you attack him
since he's close?

04:41:04.536 --> 04:41:06.466
MATT: He's not
close enough to you.

04:41:06.466 --> 04:41:08.655
You were holding an
action to do that--

04:41:08.655 --> 04:41:10.460
to attack him when
he gets close,

04:41:10.460 --> 04:41:13.340
but I'm saying that right
here, he's just out of range.

04:41:13.340 --> 04:41:16.420
He flies down, and he's
outside of the combat range.

04:41:16.420 --> 04:41:18.650
And he looks back
towards Jester.

04:41:18.650 --> 04:41:22.830
He goes, "I could really
use your help with this."

04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:25.770
You see as he reaches
in his pocket,

04:41:25.770 --> 04:41:29.390
and begins to pull out some
sort of strange black dust,

04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:33.630
and scattering it in the
center of the chamber.

04:41:33.630 --> 04:41:36.520
I need you make a wisdom
saving throw for me, Jester.

04:41:36.520 --> 04:41:38.010
TALIESIN: With a d4.

04:41:40.288 --> 04:41:42.170
LAURA: I'm scared of my dice tonight.

04:41:42.170 --> 04:41:44.183
MARISHA: Come on.
LIAM: Come on, La!

04:41:49.019 --> 04:41:51.640
SAM: Was it a save of some sort?

04:41:51.640 --> 04:41:54.720
LAURA: It's 10 plus nine.

04:41:54.720 --> 04:41:55.570
19.

04:41:55.570 --> 04:41:57.180
MATT: 19, you resist it.

04:41:57.180 --> 04:41:59.784
(cheering)

04:41:59.784 --> 04:42:01.430
MARISHA: That's right!

04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:02.770
SAM: That Bless!

04:42:05.570 --> 04:42:06.593
MATT: All right.

04:42:06.593 --> 04:42:09.510
That finishes Obann's turn. Jester, you're up.
MARISHA: (whispering) Fuck.

04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:12.012
LAURA: I'm going to
step out of the circle.

04:42:13.704 --> 04:42:15.576
MATT: Which way?

04:42:15.576 --> 04:42:17.920
LAURA: Yeah, towards
him, why the fuck not?

04:42:17.920 --> 04:42:19.140
MATT: Okay.

04:42:20.503 --> 04:42:22.580
LIAM: Sounds like
she's Russian mafia.

04:42:22.580 --> 04:42:23.789
"Yeah, why the fuck not?"

04:42:23.789 --> 04:42:25.310
LAURA: Why the fuck not?

04:42:25.310 --> 04:42:26.730
And I'm going to--

04:42:26.730 --> 04:42:28.680
TRAVIS: Jester Wick.

04:42:28.680 --> 04:42:30.690
LAURA: -- reach out to him...

04:42:32.090 --> 04:42:34.280
and cast Inflict Wounds.
MARISHA: Yes.

04:42:34.280 --> 04:42:35.535
MATT: Okay, at what level?

04:42:35.535 --> 04:42:38.020
LAURA: That would
be at 3rd-level.

04:42:38.020 --> 04:42:38.832
MATT: All right.

04:42:38.832 --> 04:42:41.440
MARISHA: It's necrotic, yeah?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

04:42:41.440 --> 04:42:45.030
MARISHA: It's the one they're
not all immune to, it seems.

04:42:45.030 --> 04:42:48.440
LAURA: Oh, plus four.

04:42:48.440 --> 04:42:49.910
Four.

04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:50.710
20?

04:42:50.710 --> 04:42:52.904
MATT: 20 is exactly his armor class.
(cheering)

04:42:52.904 --> 04:42:55.872
TRAVIS: Oh my god, finally!
That shit is so hot and cold.

04:42:55.872 --> 04:42:58.150
ASHLEY: Yes, get it.
SAM: Two Blesses in a row.

04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:59.460
MARISHA: Bless!

04:43:00.060 --> 04:43:01.060
SAM: Church!

04:43:01.060 --> 04:43:03.826
MARISHA: #blessed.

04:43:03.826 --> 04:43:06.620
LAURA: Is that a 10? That's a 10.

04:43:06.620 --> 04:43:08.380
Okay, so thats how many, 5d10?

04:43:08.380 --> 04:43:09.880
MATT: 5d10.

04:43:09.880 --> 04:43:13.346
LAURA: Nine, 16, 24.

04:43:13.346 --> 04:43:14.770
SAM: Good rolls.

04:43:14.770 --> 04:43:19.096
LAURA: 26, plus one.

04:43:19.096 --> 04:43:19.896
27.

04:43:19.896 --> 04:43:21.120
MATT: 27 points necrotic damage.

04:43:21.120 --> 04:43:23.930
You reach out and grab the front of his chest.

04:43:23.930 --> 04:43:28.060
And as you release the divine energy,
you see the green energy of the Traveler reach

04:43:28.060 --> 04:43:31.380
into his body, and then
pierce into the center of his flesh.

04:43:31.380 --> 04:43:34.050
(grunting) Flinches back,
his darkened eyes suddenly

04:43:34.050 --> 04:43:37.260
go deep, deep forest green, and
you see him (gasping)

04:43:37.260 --> 04:43:38.980
have a hard time
breathing for a second.

04:43:38.980 --> 04:43:40.900
SAM: Yes.
ASHLEY: Yes!

04:43:40.900 --> 04:43:44.610
LAURA: For my
bonus action, can I

04:43:44.610 --> 04:43:48.516
reach down and try to smear
the glyph on the ground?

04:43:48.516 --> 04:43:50.856
I don't know if it'll work.

04:43:50.856 --> 04:43:53.640
MATT: That would be more of an
action to actively adjust it, yeah.

04:43:53.640 --> 04:43:55.240
LAURA: All right.

04:43:55.240 --> 04:43:58.183
MATT: Okay. Beau, you're up.
Nott, you're on deck.

04:43:58.183 --> 04:44:00.600
MARISHA: All right, I'm going
to come out of the darkness.

04:44:00.600 --> 04:44:01.670
MATT: Okay.

04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:04.980
MARISHA: And I'm going to run 
towards where I heard Obann's voice.

04:44:04.980 --> 04:44:07.330
Can I do like, doo, doo, doo,

04:44:07.330 --> 04:44:09.340
parkour badass monk shit off of the pillar.

04:44:09.340 --> 04:44:10.900
(laughter)

04:44:10.900 --> 04:44:12.490
Forward flip.

04:44:12.490 --> 04:44:13.290
MATT: Sure.

04:44:13.290 --> 04:44:15.500
MARISHA: Flying
kick to his face.

04:44:15.500 --> 04:44:17.330
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

04:44:17.330 --> 04:44:18.502
Super high DC.

04:44:18.502 --> 04:44:20.534
LAURA: Don't land in a glyph!

04:44:22.960 --> 04:44:24.500
MARISHA: 12?

04:44:25.450 --> 04:44:28.390
MATT: Oh, huh, uh, aah!

04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:30.433
You--
MARISHA: Slide down the wall.

04:44:30.433 --> 04:44:31.623
LAURA: You get
advantage, because he's--

04:44:31.623 --> 04:44:33.885
MATT: You don't take any fall
damage, but you do fall prone.

04:44:33.885 --> 04:44:35.427
MARISHA: Wait, do
I get a d4 with it?

04:44:35.427 --> 04:44:38.100
TALIESIN: Not for that.
MATT: Not for an ability check, no.

04:44:38.100 --> 04:44:40.350
It was a difficult
acrobatics check.

04:44:40.350 --> 04:44:41.810
SAM: And you failed it.

04:44:41.810 --> 04:44:44.220
MATT: So you failed it.

04:44:44.220 --> 04:44:45.600
So you fall prone.

04:44:45.600 --> 04:44:48.090
And you climb up and you
slip off the top, tumble.

04:44:48.090 --> 04:44:49.860
You keep yourself from
taking fall damage.

04:44:49.860 --> 04:44:52.440
But you do fall prone.

04:44:52.440 --> 04:44:53.240
You can--

04:44:53.240 --> 04:44:56.593
MARISHA: I still have
like half my movement.

04:44:56.593 --> 04:44:58.510
MATT: You used about--
MARISHA: Can I stand up?

04:44:58.510 --> 04:45:01.620
MATT: You used about 20 to
get over there and then fell.

04:45:01.620 --> 04:45:03.640
So you could use the
other 20 to get up.

04:45:03.640 --> 04:45:05.697
MARISHA: Yeah. And then
I'm next to him, right?

04:45:05.697 --> 04:45:07.810
MATT: And you have a
speed of 50, that's right.

04:45:07.810 --> 04:45:10.090
MATT: So you can still
get over there, yeah.

04:45:10.090 --> 04:45:11.195
Fucking monks.

04:45:11.195 --> 04:45:13.273
MARISHA: I just stand
up and look around

04:45:13.273 --> 04:45:15.830
and hope no one saw it.
LAURA: I saw it.

04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:18.172
TALIESIN: Everybody saw it.
MATT: Everybody saw it.

04:45:18.172 --> 04:45:20.142
TRAVIS: Nice move!

04:45:20.142 --> 04:45:22.140
MARISHA: Thanks, I‘m tired.

04:45:22.140 --> 04:45:23.526
SAM: You fell.

04:45:23.526 --> 04:45:24.912
MARISHA: (screaming)

04:45:24.912 --> 04:45:27.100
MATT: All right, go for it.

04:45:27.100 --> 04:45:28.400
MARISHA: (wailing)

04:45:28.400 --> 04:45:30.634
LAURA: Advantage.
TALIESIN: Advantage and a d4.

04:45:30.634 --> 04:45:32.759
MARISHA: Advantage?
LAURA: Because he's Faerie Fired.

04:45:32.759 --> 04:45:35.630
TRAVIS: She is
dignity, she is grace.

04:45:35.630 --> 04:45:38.970
MARISHA: Okay, 22?

04:45:38.970 --> 04:45:40.260
MATT: That hits.

04:45:40.260 --> 04:45:43.215
MARISHA: For the first
attack, 10 damage.

04:45:43.215 --> 04:45:46.335
MATT: All righty.

04:45:46.335 --> 04:45:49.020
SAM: (As Pumat) Oh,
there's so much blood!

04:45:49.020 --> 04:45:51.562
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

04:45:51.562 --> 04:45:53.316
MATT: Stunning Strike, you said?

04:45:53.316 --> 04:45:56.016
MARISHA: (laughs)
Stunning Strike.

04:45:56.016 --> 04:45:58.760
MATT: That is a 22.

04:45:58.760 --> 04:46:00.990
MARISHA: 22?!
MATT: He rolled pretty high.

04:46:00.990 --> 04:46:02.230
MARISHA: Second attack?

04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:04.450
TRAVIS: (As Pumat)
They just keep coming.

04:46:04.450 --> 04:46:05.600
MARISHA: Cocked.

04:46:05.600 --> 04:46:08.136
ASHLEY: I’m going to vomit.
I feel like I'm going to puke.

04:46:10.200 --> 04:46:11.910
MARISHA: 22 again?

04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:13.030
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

04:46:13.030 --> 04:46:13.830
Damage?

04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:16.380
MARISHA: Eight damage.
MATT: Eight damage? All righty.

04:46:16.380 --> 04:46:17.680
Bonus action?

04:46:20.547 --> 04:46:22.088
MARISHA: He rolled high.

04:46:22.088 --> 04:46:24.635
(whispering) Constitution save-- [inaudible]

04:46:24.635 --> 04:46:27.202
MATT: It's up to you. What are you going to do?

04:46:27.202 --> 04:46:29.850
MARISHA: I want to go stun him.

04:46:29.850 --> 04:46:31.380
Stunning Strike.

04:46:31.380 --> 04:46:33.960
Just roll like a natural
one or something.

04:46:33.960 --> 04:46:36.750
MATT: Same roll, 22.

04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:37.856
Sorry.

04:46:37.856 --> 04:46:39.490
TALIESIN: It was worth it.

04:46:39.490 --> 04:46:41.210
LAURA: It could have been good.

04:46:41.210 --> 04:46:42.350
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:46:45.192 --> 04:46:47.806
MATT: Bonus action,
what are you doing?

04:46:47.806 --> 04:46:50.160
MARISHA: Bonus action,
I'll just take one hit.

04:46:50.160 --> 04:46:52.406
SAM: Go for it,
roll for the attack.

04:46:52.406 --> 04:46:53.780
LAURA: Still advantage.

04:46:53.780 --> 04:46:55.160
MARISHA: Still advantage.

04:46:55.160 --> 04:46:57.365
TALIESIN: Still d4.

04:46:57.365 --> 04:46:59.328
MARISHA: Rolled a
natural 18, so 28.

04:46:59.328 --> 04:47:00.870
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

04:47:00.870 --> 04:47:04.611
MARISHA: 30 total. And another eight damage.

04:47:04.611 --> 04:47:07.088
MATT: Another eight damage, got it. 
That finish your turn?

04:47:07.088 --> 04:47:09.415
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All right, Beauregard is done.

04:47:09.415 --> 04:47:11.040
Nott, you're up.
Caleb, you're on deck.

04:47:11.040 --> 04:47:12.640
SAM: Oh, I'm up?
MATT: Yeah.

04:47:12.640 --> 04:47:14.220
SAM: Okay.

04:47:14.220 --> 04:47:17.850
It seems engaged, so I will
attack it with my cross<i>bow</i>.

04:47:17.850 --> 04:47:20.320
MATT: Go <i>for</i> it. Roll for the cross<i>bow</i>.

04:47:20.320 --> 04:47:21.751
SAM: Natural one.

04:47:21.751 --> 04:47:24.156
(groaning)

04:47:24.156 --> 04:47:24.956
TRAVIS: Fucking A.

04:47:24.956 --> 04:47:26.540
LAURA: Although you
do have advantage.

04:47:26.540 --> 04:47:28.650
TALIESIN: And a d4.
SAM: Oh, great.

04:47:28.650 --> 04:47:31.800
My advantage sucks
also, plus a d4.

04:47:31.800 --> 04:47:34.025
It's not going to hit.

04:47:34.025 --> 04:47:34.825
18.

04:47:34.825 --> 04:47:37.885
MATT: 18 misses.
SAM: Okay. And bonus action, also attack.

04:47:37.885 --> 04:47:39.505
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Also advantage.

04:47:39.505 --> 04:47:41.940
SAM: Okay, way better.

04:47:41.940 --> 04:47:45.300
20, to a 32 to hit.

04:47:45.300 --> 04:47:47.155
MATT: 32 to hit. That definitely hits.

04:47:47.155 --> 04:47:49.360
SAM: Uh-huh. And with sneak attack?

04:47:49.360 --> 04:47:53.110
MATT: Yep. Because he is adjacent
to Beauregard and Jester.

04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:56.910
SAM: 10, 15, 16, 22
points of damage.

04:47:56.910 --> 04:48:00.491
MATT: Nice. All righty.

04:48:00.491 --> 04:48:03.538
He's starting to look a little hurt.
SAM: A <i>little</i> hurt?

04:48:03.538 --> 04:48:05.330
MATT: I'm starting to see 
some wear on him.

04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:07.040
SAM: A <i>little</i> wear?
MATT: Yeah.

04:48:07.040 --> 04:48:08.666
Does that finish
your turn, Nott?

04:48:08.666 --> 04:48:11.187
SAM: I'm going to just move another 10 feet that way.
MATT: Ba-doop. You got it.

04:48:11.187 --> 04:48:12.820
TRAVIS: (falsetto)
"A <i>little</i> wear?"

04:48:12.820 --> 04:48:15.115
MATT: Okay. Caleb, you're up.
LIAM: Very simple, I'm going to move

04:48:15.115 --> 04:48:17.990
just five feet this way
so I can get eyes on Obann.

04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:22.550
And let's go another five feet,
and chuck another Fire Bolt

04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:25.500
at him, which is not going to do much, 
but I'm going to do it anyway.

04:48:25.500 --> 04:48:28.820
MATT: It does give him-- oh, from there, 
he doesn't have cover, so you're good.

04:48:28.820 --> 04:48:30.060
LIAM: Okay, so that's 16.

04:48:30.060 --> 04:48:31.860
MATT: 16 misses.
LIAM: It misses.

04:48:31.860 --> 04:48:34.667
MATT: It just goes through the wing.
(whooshing) It knocks it out of the way.

04:48:34.667 --> 04:48:36.300
LIAM: Okay, that's it. I'm just waiting.

04:48:36.300 --> 04:48:38.670
MATT: All right. Top of the turn.

04:48:38.670 --> 04:48:40.930
(laughter)

04:48:42.738 --> 04:48:43.859
LAURA: No!

04:48:43.859 --> 04:48:45.493
SAM: Oh, who's that? What's that?
What's that going on?

04:48:45.493 --> 04:48:46.906
TRAVIS: It's that beesh.
TALIESIN: I knew it.

04:48:46.906 --> 04:48:49.350
LAURA: Is that beesh?
ASHLEY: This bish.

04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:50.210
LIAM: This bish.

04:48:50.210 --> 04:48:53.070
SAM: Oh no, she's getting in a circle, 
isn't she? Oh no, she's not.

04:48:53.070 --> 04:48:55.035
LIAM: No, she's cutting
off the wizard's head.

04:48:55.035 --> 04:48:58.560
MATT: That is going
to be a 28 to hit.

04:48:58.560 --> 04:48:59.530
LIAM: Hits.

04:48:59.530 --> 04:49:01.420
LAURA: Are you sure, though?

04:49:04.286 --> 04:49:06.346
MATT: (many dice clacking)

04:49:06.346 --> 04:49:07.998
ALL: (groaning)

04:49:07.998 --> 04:49:11.000
MARISHA: Did you see the joy
on that face when he rolled that?

04:49:11.000 --> 04:49:12.792
LIAM: She could do this in one hit.

04:49:15.100 --> 04:49:17.005
That'd be kind of cool.

04:49:21.410 --> 04:49:23.810
MATT: 46 points of
piercing damage.

04:49:23.810 --> 04:49:26.780
I need you to make a constitution 
saving throw for me, please.

04:49:26.780 --> 04:49:27.920
TALIESIN: With a d4.

04:49:27.920 --> 04:49:29.864
LAURA: Can you Shield?

04:49:29.864 --> 04:49:32.718
LIAM: Wouldn't have done anything.

04:49:32.718 --> 04:49:33.518
15--

04:49:33.518 --> 04:49:36.320
MATT: With a d4.
LIAM: Yep.

04:49:36.320 --> 04:49:38.312
LAURA: (laughs)

04:49:38.312 --> 04:49:40.900
MATT: You are the paperclip.
TALIESIN: Man.

04:49:40.900 --> 04:49:42.990
I want everyone to live through this.

04:49:42.990 --> 04:49:45.140
LIAM: 21.
MATT: You resist the poison.

04:49:45.140 --> 04:49:49.430
Second strike against you
is going to be a 22 to hit.

04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:51.450
LIAM: It hits.
MATT: You take--

04:49:51.450 --> 04:49:54.027
TALIESIN: "I see you're
trying to resist the poison."

04:49:54.027 --> 04:49:56.360
MATT: --11 points of slashing
damage-- or, piercing damage,

04:49:56.360 --> 04:49:58.860
and then you also have
made another constitution saving throw.

04:49:58.860 --> 04:50:00.657
LIAM: Hm?
Another Constitution saving throw.

04:50:00.657 --> 04:50:02.720
LIAM: Oh, for same deal.
MATT: Correct.

04:50:05.940 --> 04:50:06.820
SAM: Plus d4.

04:50:06.820 --> 04:50:09.080
(laughter)

04:50:09.080 --> 04:50:11.514
LIAM: 13.
MATT: 13? You are poisoned.

04:50:11.514 --> 04:50:14.480
SAM: (groaning)

04:50:14.480 --> 04:50:16.420
SAM: No, Caleb, no!

04:50:16.420 --> 04:50:19.880
MATT: And she is
going to (whooshing)

04:50:19.880 --> 04:50:21.740
shift over into the circle.

04:50:21.740 --> 04:50:24.610
LIAM: Oh, I will throw a
Fire Bolt at her as she goes.

04:50:24.610 --> 04:50:27.376
MATT: You have
War Caster, you can.

04:50:27.376 --> 04:50:29.340
MARISHA: (sneezes)
LAURA: Bless you!

04:50:29.340 --> 04:50:32.335
LIAM: No, it's 20.
MATT: 20? That hits.

04:50:32.335 --> 04:50:33.667
LIAM: With Bless.
ASHLEY: Yes!

04:50:33.667 --> 04:50:35.710
MATT: Actually, she's going
to use her reaction to parry.

04:50:35.710 --> 04:50:37.627
LIAM: For a Fire Bolt?
MATT: No, she'll take it.

04:50:37.627 --> 04:50:39.166
She’ll take it.

04:50:39.166 --> 04:50:41.540
LIAM: I'm confused!
MATT: Go for it.

04:50:45.467 --> 04:50:46.920
LIAM: Big five.

04:50:46.920 --> 04:50:49.242
MATT: Awesome. Two points of fire damage.

04:50:51.230 --> 04:50:55.326
Okay. Now, Fjord, it's your turn.

04:50:55.326 --> 04:50:56.400
TRAVIS: Yeah, I will--

04:50:56.400 --> 04:51:00.100
MATT: You're going to stay in that circle.
And Obann telepathically to you says--

04:51:00.100 --> 04:51:01.122
TRAVIS: No--
TALIESIN: No!

04:51:01.122 --> 04:51:04.030
Oh, that's right. No, you broke it.
It's all right, never mind.

04:51:04.030 --> 04:51:07.180
TALIESIN: Fuck off.
TRAVIS: I'm getting the fuck out of that circle.

04:51:07.180 --> 04:51:07.980
MARISHA: "N-no. No."

04:51:07.980 --> 04:51:09.905
TALIESIN: Whatever the
opposite of that is.

04:51:09.915 --> 04:51:13.730
TRAVIS: And I will walk around and
try and get within melee range

04:51:13.730 --> 04:51:15.896
of Obann on the ground.

04:51:19.006 --> 04:51:22.780
MATT: You can get over here.

04:51:22.780 --> 04:51:24.235
25 feet.

04:51:24.235 --> 04:51:26.540
SAM: You got nice little
circle going around Obi.

04:51:28.160 --> 04:51:31.395
TRAVIS: Two strikes
with the Star Razor.

04:51:31.395 --> 04:51:33.290
Advantage because he's on Faerie Fire.

04:51:33.290 --> 04:51:36.100
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.
TRAVIS: Yay!

04:51:36.100 --> 04:51:39.210
TALIESIN: It's my mantra.

04:51:39.210 --> 04:51:41.770
TRAVIS: That is a 22.

04:51:41.770 --> 04:51:44.327
23 to hit. I didn’t need to roll that.

04:51:44.327 --> 04:51:46.408
MATT: 23 to hit? He's going to go ahead and use--

04:51:46.408 --> 04:51:48.950
No, he can't do that. Never mind.
Yeah, that hits.

04:51:48.950 --> 04:51:51.623
TRAVIS: Okay, and
the second one is...

04:51:55.066 --> 04:51:56.190
30 to hit.

04:51:56.190 --> 04:51:58.140
MATT: Yeah, that hits as well.

04:52:00.877 --> 04:52:02.860
SAM: Whoa!
TRAVIS: Wow.

04:52:02.860 --> 04:52:04.740
MARISHA: Hey, that's cool.

04:52:04.740 --> 04:52:08.870
TRAVIS: And 17 is 29.

04:52:08.870 --> 04:52:11.690
MATT: 29 points of damage
from both strikes, as you rush

04:52:11.690 --> 04:52:14.787
around the way, and (whooshing)
arc throw him twice,

04:52:14.787 --> 04:52:17.701
the blade (whooshing) vcutting through.
He's like (groaning).

04:52:17.701 --> 04:52:19.941
He sees you step
out of the circle,

04:52:19.941 --> 04:52:23.090
and he's starting to see
his plan begin to crumble.

04:52:23.090 --> 04:52:25.110
All right. Does that finish your turn?

04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:30.080
TRAVIS: Yes.

04:52:30.080 --> 04:52:33.160
Sorry, it's a 31. 31, just plus two.

04:52:33.160 --> 04:52:36.050
MATT: Oh, 31, got you.
TRAVIS: Yes, that is the end my turn.

04:52:36.050 --> 04:52:38.288
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

04:52:38.288 --> 04:52:40.170
TALIESIN: I'm not
even going to move.

04:52:40.170 --> 04:52:42.120
Do I have a clear shot
on Obann right now?

04:52:42.120 --> 04:52:45.690
MATT: From where
you are right now?

04:52:45.690 --> 04:52:46.873
No, you'd have to move a bit.

04:52:46.873 --> 04:52:48.790
TALIESIN: All right,
staying against the wall.

04:52:48.790 --> 04:52:50.740
SAM: (whispering) We
do this all the time.

04:52:50.740 --> 04:52:54.200
TALIESIN: Staying against the wall, I'm going to-- 
let's pop another Blight.

04:52:54.200 --> 04:52:56.080
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:52:57.564 --> 04:53:02.650
MATT: That is
with advantage, 25.

04:53:02.650 --> 04:53:03.910
TALIESIN: Still half.

04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:06.150
LIAM: --reaction to hit him.

04:53:06.940 --> 04:53:09.710
TALIESIN: So I'm doing this again.

04:53:09.710 --> 04:53:11.100
Two.

04:53:11.100 --> 04:53:13.830
TRAVIS: Even if he's whipped, he can still bamf out.

04:53:13.830 --> 04:53:14.630
TALIESIN: Four.

04:53:17.780 --> 04:53:18.580
Six.

04:53:18.580 --> 04:53:21.845
MARISHA: And then we have Fjord, Cad,
and Yasha before his turn comes up.

04:53:21.845 --> 04:53:24.685
SAM: Well, Fjord, Cad, and
Yasha <i>have</i> to kill him.

04:53:24.685 --> 04:53:26.054
TALIESIN: So that's--

04:53:29.448 --> 04:53:31.050
SAM: Or silence him?

04:53:33.370 --> 04:53:34.610
Can anyone silence him?

04:53:34.610 --> 04:53:36.700
MATT: How much damage
is that?

04:53:36.700 --> 04:53:42.770
TALIESIN: That's 19, 24, 34.

04:53:42.770 --> 04:53:43.570
39.

04:53:43.570 --> 04:53:45.000
MATT: 39?

04:53:45.000 --> 04:53:48.886
Points of necrotic,
half of that into 18.

04:53:48.886 --> 04:53:50.025
TRAVIS: Yes.

04:53:50.025 --> 04:53:52.285
MATT: So (whooshing),
you see the blood,

04:53:52.285 --> 04:53:55.500
the moisture being
drawn from his body,

04:53:55.500 --> 04:53:57.910
the impact taking hold in him.

04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:59.200
It hurt.

04:53:59.200 --> 04:54:02.320
TALIESIN: Damn it.
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Caduceus?

04:54:02.320 --> 04:54:04.280
TALIESIN: Yeah, yep.

04:54:04.280 --> 04:54:07.200
I'm actually just going
to curl against the wall

04:54:07.200 --> 04:54:10.080
even further just to try
and to be out of his sight.

04:54:10.080 --> 04:54:12.772
MATT: Okay, got it.
Yasha, you're up.

04:54:12.772 --> 04:54:14.820
ASHLEY: Okay, I’m going to take--

04:54:14.820 --> 04:54:17.595
I'm going to take the
attacks against him.

04:54:17.595 --> 04:54:19.015
MARISHA: (singing) So poetic.

04:54:19.015 --> 04:54:22.240
MATT: You have advantage on these
without having to go reckless.

04:54:22.240 --> 04:54:25.302
Because Jester is on the
opposite side of you.

04:54:25.302 --> 04:54:28.297
TRAVIS: And Faerie Fire.
MATT: And Faerie Fire, hat's right.

04:54:28.297 --> 04:54:30.553
LAURA: Your dice are weird!

04:54:30.553 --> 04:54:33.530
ASHLEY: I know, I just like how 
this one rolls when it does well.

04:54:33.530 --> 04:54:34.980
Okay, okay, okay.

04:54:34.980 --> 04:54:37.500
TRAVIS: (laughs) “When it does well.”
ASHLEY: 16.

04:54:37.500 --> 04:54:41.396
MATT: It looks cool, but it
keeps rolling like it’s designed to be cocked.

04:54:41.396 --> 04:54:43.145
TALIESIN: Plus a
four if you want.

04:54:43.145 --> 04:54:45.540
MATT: Not a lot thought
went into that one.

04:54:45.540 --> 04:54:47.520
Not a lot of R&amp;D.

04:54:48.910 --> 04:54:50.910
ASHLEY: 26.
MATT: 26 hits.

04:54:50.910 --> 04:54:52.170
ASHLEY: Yes.

04:54:53.540 --> 04:54:54.988
Okay.

04:54:55.468 --> 04:54:58.350
SAM: Put him a body bag!

04:54:58.900 --> 04:55:02.650
ASHLEY: Oh, okay,
I'll keep that one.

04:55:02.650 --> 04:55:04.642
Okay, so eight, nine.

04:55:04.642 --> 04:55:07.559
TALIESIN: And you can reroll.
LAURA: Yeah, reroll one!

04:55:09.429 --> 04:55:10.955
ASHLEY: Much better.
LAURA: Nice!

04:55:17.540 --> 04:55:19.595
ASHLEY: 22 points
for the first hit.

04:55:19.595 --> 04:55:21.615
MATT: Nice! The second hit?

04:55:24.250 --> 04:55:27.083
MARISHA: Ain't it cute?
TALIESIN: It's like felted.

04:55:27.083 --> 04:55:29.070
TRAVIS: It's real sheep ass.

04:55:29.070 --> 04:55:32.370
ASHLEY: Yeah, fucking four. 
I get advantage on the second hit as well?

04:55:32.370 --> 04:55:33.641
MATT: Yeah.

04:55:33.641 --> 04:55:35.890
ASHLEY: 19.
MATT: Total of 19?

04:55:35.890 --> 04:55:38.940
ASHLEY: It's critical, no--
MATT: Oh, you rolled a natural-- that's a critical!

04:55:38.940 --> 04:55:40.550
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: No shit!

04:55:40.550 --> 04:55:41.710
ASHLEY: So 27.

04:55:41.710 --> 04:55:45.210
MATT: Okay. You don't roll the extra d6,
It’s just your 2d6 plus whatever.

04:55:45.210 --> 04:55:50.175
2d6 times two, plus and an
extra d6 and then your modifier.

04:55:50.175 --> 04:55:52.880
SAM: 5d6.

04:55:52.880 --> 04:55:56.260
ASHLEY: Let's roll this again
just to see what happens.

04:55:56.260 --> 04:55:57.890
Okay, so we'll take the four.

04:55:57.890 --> 04:56:00.270
So nine total, so 18.

04:56:00.270 --> 04:56:01.560
MATT: Mm-hmm?

04:56:01.560 --> 04:56:06.320
ASHLEY: Plus an additional
d6, which is a four.

04:56:06.320 --> 04:56:08.720
What was I on? 24?
LAURA: 22?

04:56:08.720 --> 04:56:11.215
TALIESIN: You're at 22.
LAURA: You're at 22 points.

04:56:11.215 --> 04:56:12.015
ASHLEY: 22.

04:56:12.015 --> 04:56:14.350
TRAVIS: With your modifiers.

04:56:14.350 --> 04:56:16.810
ASHLEY: And my modifiers.
What am I adding? What am I adding?

04:56:16.810 --> 04:56:18.530
(laughter)
I'm sorry.

04:56:18.530 --> 04:56:19.770
TRAVIS: Your rage and your--

04:56:19.770 --> 04:56:23.392
ASHLEY: Plus my rage,
which is an extra--

04:56:25.552 --> 04:56:26.762
22.

04:56:26.762 --> 04:56:27.820
(laughter)

04:56:27.820 --> 04:56:29.200
ASHLEY: Sorry.

04:56:29.200 --> 04:56:31.780
SAM: High pressure late night math.
LAURA: 27?

04:56:31.780 --> 04:56:34.020
ASHLEY: Yeah. That's an extra seven?

04:56:34.020 --> 04:56:34.820
No.

04:56:34.820 --> 04:56:37.385
MATT: Oh, for the offside?
You going to be plus--

04:56:37.385 --> 04:56:40.370
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
MATT: It's been a while, bear with her, folks.

04:56:40.370 --> 04:56:42.400
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

04:56:42.400 --> 04:56:44.135
LAURA: ♪ It's been a while ♪

04:56:44.135 --> 04:56:45.200
ASHLEY: 22 plus--

04:56:45.200 --> 04:56:50.160
MATT: Your rage damage at this level
is I think is plus two? Plus three?

04:56:50.160 --> 04:56:52.792
Plus three at this level,
plus your strength modifier, which is plus--

04:56:52.792 --> 04:56:55.244
ASHLEY: Three.
MATT: Three, so it's plus--

04:56:55.244 --> 04:56:57.410
LAURA: So plus six.
ASHLEY: Okay, so 22, 28.

04:56:57.410 --> 04:56:59.068
MATT: 28 points of damage.

04:56:59.328 --> 04:57:00.750
How do you want to do this?

04:57:00.750 --> 04:57:02.062
(cheering)

04:57:02.062 --> 04:57:05.172
TRAVIS: Are you fucking serious?
MARISHA: Yes!

04:57:05.172 --> 04:57:06.480
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

04:57:06.480 --> 04:57:08.990
MATT: Sometimes it's fucking poetic.

04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:11.025
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

04:57:11.025 --> 04:57:13.640
Okay, I want to
do something very bad.

04:57:13.640 --> 04:57:14.850
LAURA: Do it.

04:57:17.597 --> 04:57:19.164
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:57:20.244 --> 04:57:25.080
Is he turned away from
me, or was he looking at me?

04:57:25.080 --> 04:57:28.620
MATT: After Jester grabbed him,
Beau beat the shit out of him.

04:57:28.620 --> 04:57:30.650
Fjord came around
and hacked him.

04:57:32.810 --> 04:57:35.880
He's like, (groaning) keeping
around, and he's looking out.

04:57:35.880 --> 04:57:39.850
He's looking for the Caedogeist to come jump in 
and help him turn the tide.

04:57:39.850 --> 04:57:43.140
And you see he's getting ready to glance at 
one of your friends who he hasn't yet

04:57:43.140 --> 04:57:44.690
to try and take their mind.

04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:48.760
And then out of the corner of his eye,
he sees you approach over the shoulder.

04:57:48.760 --> 04:57:51.600
ASHLEY: I don't know if
I'll be able to do this.

04:57:51.600 --> 04:57:56.980
But I want to reach
up to the top of his wings,

04:57:56.980 --> 04:57:58.590
and I want to pull them off.

04:57:58.590 --> 04:57:59.625
MATT: Yeah.

04:57:59.625 --> 04:58:04.440
As you reach and grab, you see
electrical energy (crackling)

04:58:04.440 --> 04:58:07.170
across her arms.

04:58:07.170 --> 04:58:10.530
As her eyes begin to spark
with bright blue anger,

04:58:10.530 --> 04:58:13.440
she puts her foot against the
back of his shoulder blades.

04:58:13.440 --> 04:58:16.656
And (cracking) he starts
screaming.

04:58:18.790 --> 04:58:20.928
Tears the wings off of his back.

04:58:20.928 --> 04:58:22.950
They go scattering
across the ground,

04:58:22.950 --> 04:58:25.680
spinning, spattering his
dark blood across the stone.

04:58:25.680 --> 04:58:29.028
He falls to his knees-- (gasping)

04:58:29.028 --> 04:58:31.380
ASHLEY: And then I'll
take out Skin Gorger.

04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:35.400
Right through the chest.

04:58:35.400 --> 04:58:38.197
MATT: (gasping)
The blade goes in.

04:58:38.197 --> 04:58:42.260
(wheezing) You pull
the blade out,

04:58:42.260 --> 04:58:45.676
and he falls to the ground.

04:58:45.676 --> 04:58:47.465
(coughing)

04:58:49.255 --> 04:58:52.606
"Angel of Irons, why have you abandoned me?

04:58:53.985 --> 04:58:56.050
“I did everything you asked."

04:58:58.870 --> 04:59:03.570
All the light in the
room gets darker.

04:59:03.570 --> 04:59:07.480
The actual pillar and the
obelisk seems to flicker.

04:59:07.480 --> 04:59:11.952
And the shadows
grow long and deep.

04:59:11.952 --> 04:59:15.670
This low vibration
takes the floor.

04:59:15.670 --> 04:59:17.350
TRAVIS: He's in a circle.

04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:27.130
MATT: And you hear a--
(speaking Abyssal)

04:59:27.130 --> 04:59:30.200
Any of you speak Abyssal?

04:59:30.200 --> 04:59:32.820
ASHLEY: I speak Abyssal.
LAURA: Holy shit!

04:59:32.820 --> 04:59:34.260
MATT: You hear:

04:59:35.382 --> 04:59:38.380
“You failed,

04:59:38.380 --> 04:59:43.020
“and so shall be punished."

04:59:43.020 --> 04:59:45.656
And he goes, "No, no!"

04:59:45.656 --> 04:59:47.740
The blood
pouring out of his chest

04:59:47.740 --> 04:59:49.490
begins to blacken.

04:59:50.290 --> 04:59:54.155
ASHLEY: I look him in the face,
and I say: did you hear that?

04:59:54.155 --> 04:59:57.580
MATT: The blood becomes
more and more of a gush,

04:59:57.580 --> 04:59:59.020
like a waterfall.

04:59:59.020 --> 05:00:01.190
And his body begins to
melt, and his face--

05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:03.640
ALL: (groaning)

05:00:03.640 --> 05:00:08.860
MATT: His entire corpse turns into
this black, oily sludge that

05:00:08.860 --> 05:00:11.700
begins to spill out on
the ground and expand,

05:00:11.700 --> 05:00:17.450
you all step back a bit
as you watch it boil and roil.

05:00:17.450 --> 05:00:19.120
(slurping)

05:00:19.120 --> 05:00:21.205
LAURA: Uh-oh, stand
back, stand back!

05:00:21.205 --> 05:00:23.092
MATT: Tendrils begin
to reach out of it.

05:00:23.092 --> 05:00:25.600
You guys all step back
a bit in the chamber and watch

05:00:25.600 --> 05:00:29.320
as it rises up from
the black inky mess.

05:00:29.320 --> 05:00:32.223
Obann the Punished rises.

05:00:32.223 --> 05:00:35.710
A mass of black, blue, and dark,

05:00:35.710 --> 05:00:40.532
deep green tentacles
and teeth and eyes,

05:00:40.532 --> 05:00:46.962
cursed now with a punished
form from the Chained Oblivion.

05:00:46.962 --> 05:00:49.252
SAM: Oh!

05:00:49.252 --> 05:00:52.160
(yelling) Oh!

05:00:52.160 --> 05:00:54.025
That's super gross!

05:00:54.025 --> 05:00:55.330
LIAM: It just got worse?

05:00:55.330 --> 05:00:56.785
SAM: Ew!

05:00:56.785 --> 05:00:59.406
LAURA: Did shit just get worse?

05:00:59.406 --> 05:01:01.702
SAM: The fuck is that?!

05:01:01.842 --> 05:01:05.392
MATT: And that's where we'll pick up next week.
ALL: (yelling)

05:01:05.392 --> 05:01:06.790
TALIESIN: Oh-h-h no.

05:01:06.790 --> 05:01:08.850
SAM: It's got tongues!

05:01:08.850 --> 05:01:11.415
It's got eyes hanging
off of tendrils.

05:01:11.415 --> 05:01:13.850
TRAVIS: I ate that in Japan once.
SAM: (groaning)

05:01:13.850 --> 05:01:16.410
(laughter)
TALIESIN: I don't like any of this.

05:01:16.410 --> 05:01:18.369
MARISHA: It's like the
Laughing Hand but worse.

05:01:18.369 --> 05:01:19.770
ASHLEY: Yeah.

05:01:19.770 --> 05:01:21.820
SAM: Oh god!
MARISHA: Oh my god!

05:01:21.820 --> 05:01:24.194
LAURA: He's
the little mini-Oblivion.

05:01:24.194 --> 05:01:25.676
(laughter)

05:01:25.676 --> 05:01:27.410
MARISHA: What are we
supposed to do?

05:01:27.410 --> 05:01:29.585
MATT: So we'll pick up
from there next week.

05:01:29.585 --> 05:01:30.430
SAM: Oh boy!

05:01:30.430 --> 05:01:34.216
LAURA: Maybe the Inevitable
End will help us.

05:01:34.216 --> 05:01:35.016
MATT: So.

05:01:35.016 --> 05:01:37.320
ASHLEY: Yeah, because
she's free now.

05:01:37.320 --> 05:01:39.530
TRAVIS: Maybe.

05:01:39.530 --> 05:01:42.160
MATT: We go on break,
actually, next week.

05:01:42.160 --> 05:01:43.595
Thanksgiving.

05:01:43.595 --> 05:01:44.830
So yeah.

05:01:44.830 --> 05:01:46.980
So we'll come back
first week of December,

05:01:46.980 --> 05:01:49.130
and pick up this crazy chaos.

05:01:49.130 --> 05:01:51.440
LIAM: For a very Christmas episode.
MATT: Yep.

05:01:51.454 --> 05:01:54.363
TALIESIN: It's a very Thanksgiving turkducken
that we get to play with.

05:01:54.363 --> 05:01:57.662
(laughter)
MATT: Kinda, yeah. When you think about it.

05:01:57.662 --> 05:01:58.602
LAURA: Oh my god!

05:01:58.602 --> 05:01:59.660
MATT: All right, guys.

05:01:59.660 --> 05:02:01.640
SAM: Oh man!
TALIESIN: Shit.

05:02:01.640 --> 05:02:04.040
TRAVIS: Got to get
the fuck out of here.

05:02:04.040 --> 05:02:06.350
MARISHA: Yeah, right? We're all tapped.

05:02:06.350 --> 05:02:07.940
LAURA: We're totally tapped.

05:02:07.940 --> 05:02:09.543
SAM: Maybe it's friendly now?

05:02:09.543 --> 05:02:11.140
ASHLEY: You guys are tapped.

05:02:11.140 --> 05:02:13.002
TRAVIS: Yeah, it comes over,
and it's like (slurping).

05:02:13.002 --> 05:02:14.380
SAM: Kind of tapped.

05:02:14.380 --> 05:02:16.866
TALIESIN: I'm on the edge of tapped.

05:02:16.866 --> 05:02:19.658
TRAVIS: Matt, those maps
were fucking amazing!

05:02:19.658 --> 05:02:21.700
TALIESIN: Wow!
It just kept going!

05:02:21.700 --> 05:02:23.920
TRAVIS: That was so awesome.

05:02:23.920 --> 05:02:25.394
SAM: And Ashley's back!

05:02:25.394 --> 05:02:27.814
(cheering)

05:02:27.814 --> 05:02:30.470
MARISHA: And you
killed your captor!

05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:32.775
ASHLEY: (yelling)
TRAVIS: That was fucking awesome.

05:02:32.775 --> 05:02:35.320
MATT: Yeah.

05:02:35.320 --> 05:02:37.200
Obann is gone. This is--

05:02:37.200 --> 05:02:39.355
LAURA: This is a whole other thing.
MATT: This is-- yeah.

05:02:39.355 --> 05:02:41.350
You watched the
life leave his eyes.

05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:44.170
This is a shred
of whatever remained

05:02:44.170 --> 05:02:49.810
of him being twisted
and left as a final "fuck you"

05:02:49.810 --> 05:02:52.154
from Tharizdun.
TRAVIS: Whoa.

05:02:52.154 --> 05:02:54.720
MATT: And we'll deal with
that in a couple weeks.

05:02:56.720 --> 05:02:59.767
In the meantime, guys,
those of us in the US,

05:02:59.767 --> 05:03:01.271
have a Happy Thanksgiving.

05:03:01.271 --> 05:03:04.840
The rest of you guys,
we love you anyway.

05:03:04.840 --> 05:03:08.220
But yeah, love you very
much, and is it Thursday yet?

05:03:08.220 --> 05:03:10.060
Good night.
(cheering)

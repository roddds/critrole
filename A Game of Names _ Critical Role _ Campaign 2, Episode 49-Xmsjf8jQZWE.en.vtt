00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:04.350
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.254
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:08.921
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:16.030
MATT: Like that. Before we get started, we have a
few announcements to get into. First and foremost,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.821
I want to say thank you for all of our community
members that came out for the art show this

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:27.481
weekend. It went amazingly, it was great to meet a
bunch of the artists we had the opportunity to.

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:31.664
Looking forward to meeting all those that we
didn't have the opportunity to this time for

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:36.336
hopefully future events. It went really well; we
hope to do more community-centric things like this

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:42.791
in the future. I'm very happy how it all turned
out. The live show went really well. Thank you all

00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:52.391
for coming to that who could. That is coming out
in February. Yes, so the VOD for The Search for

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:57.112
Grog is coming out in February, we'll have details
soon at critrole.com, so keep your eye peeled for

00:00:57.112 --> 00:01:05.642
that. Let's go ahead and bring it to our fantastic
sponsorship for the evening. This week, we have

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:12.063
our returning friends and family on the internet,
D&amp;D Beyond. Sam, if you don't mind.

00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:18.634
SAM: Guys, the campaign trail is heating up! As
you know, I declared my candidacy for the

00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:25.142
president of D&amp;D Beyond. I want to thank my
constituents for their inventive slogans and

00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:30.012
mottos that they sent in. I wanted to read a few
that you'll be seeing on the #SamforPresident

00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:36.471
campaign trail. These are just some of my
favorites: "Yes We Cantrip!" Pretty good, by

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:41.032
@j_viviano. "Nott, My President" by @alyssatombs.

00:01:41.032 --> 00:01:45.744
(laughter)

00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:51.062
SAM: "Crit's About to Get Real!" from
@JetPackPaul. "I Did Not Have Sexual Relations

00:01:51.062 --> 00:02:00.262
With That Manticore," that's Arsequeef. "Putting
the 'D' in D&amp;D Beyond" by @JarsonKames,

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:03.562
and "Stay Turnt" by Brian Foster,
so those are some good ones.

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:05.333
LAURA: That one's taken, though.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:11.681
SAM: Yes. Now, I may not know exactly what the
president of D&amp;D Beyond does, but I know that it's

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:17.562
an important job, and therefore, I feel like I
deserve it. But I can't win this race alone, so

00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:25.897
I'm going to need a campaign-- I'm sorry, a
Sampaign manager, so I've enlisted our own

00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:32.772
Dani Carr to be my Sampaign manager. Yes.
Hi, Dani, thanks for coming tonight.

00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:36.155
DANI: Hi! You know, I really have more important
things to do right now.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:38.885
SAM: I'm sure you do, but thank you for
volunteering.

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.441
DANI: You said you were paying me.

00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:49.043
SAM: I am, in the form of tape for your reel, so
thank you. Anyway, Dani is here tonight to keep me

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:56.769
on track as my campaign manager, as I launch into
my first ever Sampaign rally speech. Ahem.

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:06.242
Friends, Critters, countrymen. D&amp;D Beyond is a
horrifying wasteland of shame, and only I can pull

00:03:06.242 --> 00:03:08.072
it from the foul, swampy depths of--

00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:09.214
DANI: Uh-uh.

00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:18.012
SAM: I mean, D&amp;D Beyond is a wonderful app and a
sponsor of this program, where you can build your

00:03:18.012 --> 00:03:23.313
favorite characters and track their adventures and
treasures. Which is why I, Sam Riegel, will

00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:32.114
unceremoniously decimate its current president,
leaving their bodies-- I mean, I'm eager to share

00:03:32.115 --> 00:03:38.261
my plans to improve this already excellent app.
Here is what the Sam for President Sampaign stands

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:45.232
for: under my Riegelship, every character will
come preloaded with one inspiration point.

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:54.042
Your default app background will be a picture
of me. All characters get 69 hit points.

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:56.023
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:56.887
LAURA: No!

00:03:56.887 --> 00:04:04.232
SAM: Nope? Okay. You'll have a new option: a short
rest, a long rest, or a sex nap. Ah!

00:04:04.232 --> 00:04:09.903
(laughter)

00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:17.613
Well, that's it for this rally, folks. Next time,
we'll unveil my opponent, who will be...

00:04:17.613 --> 00:04:24.033
To be determined. In fact, I would like you guys to
tweet at me, at D&amp;D Beyond, and, why not? At her,

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:25.397
at Dani Carr--

00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:26.623
DANI: @ItsDaniCarr.

00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:33.382
SAM: @ItsDaniCarr, with the #SamforPresident, and
tell me which one of these guys or gals I should

00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:39.386
run against. Yes, because it's going to be a fun,
exciting battle for the White House, or Gray

00:04:39.386 --> 00:04:44.804
House, or whatever color the building is where
D&amp;D Beyond is. Anyway, thank you, and

00:04:44.804 --> 00:04:46.332
god bless Samerica!

00:04:46.623 --> 00:04:49.854
(groaning)

00:04:49.854 --> 00:04:50.905
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:54.321
ALL: Thank you, Dani!

00:04:55.782 --> 00:04:58.166
LAURA: Run away. Run while you can.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:03.206
TRAVIS: I love how you just Weekend Updated your
own sponsorship message. That's amazing.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.720
MATT: Thank you, Sam; thank you, Dani; and thank
you, D&amp;D Beyond, for your unending patience with

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:19.164
this weekly...this. Couple more announcements: the
second season of Between the Sheets begins next

00:05:19.164 --> 00:05:25.890
week, this coming Monday, January 28, at 7:00pm
Pacific. The VOD will be available on the Critical

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.015
Role YouTube channel on Wednesday, January 30. The
very first guest is a friend of the show, a

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:36.373
musician, rapper, and all-around
awesome nerd, Logic.

00:05:36.374 --> 00:05:37.372
LAURA: And author.

00:05:37.372 --> 00:05:41.937
MATT: And author, and all sorts of other awesome
stuff. He's a very prolific young man, and I can

00:05:41.937 --> 00:05:47.566
say that because I'm older than him. Super
excited, it's going to be great, and happy to kick

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:49.637
it off with such an awesome guest.

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:51.537
TRAVIS: It's going to be so good!

00:05:51.537 --> 00:05:54.272
MARISHA: It's going to be good.
It's a good episode.

00:05:54.273 --> 00:05:58.744
TALIESIN: I've been enjoying the crossover of a
whole bunch of Critical Role fans going, "Who's

00:05:58.744 --> 00:06:03.215
"Logic?" and then a whole bunch of Logic fans
going, "What's Critical Role?" I was like, this is

00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:06.393
going to be a train wreck of happiness. I'm so
excited.

00:06:06.393 --> 00:06:13.912
MATT: I'm excited. I want to give a very special
thanks to our friends at Wyrmwood, who have

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:18.739
continuously supported Critical Role and the
community for a very long time. They actually

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:23.364
created, for the live show and for the show here,
this badass DM screen that I get to unveil!

00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:24.427
LIAM: Ah, it a dragon!

00:06:24.427 --> 00:06:26.568
TALIESIN: Ah, there's dragons! Put it back!

00:06:26.568 --> 00:06:28.292
LAURA: I mean, that's beautiful!

00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:34.515
MATT: Yeah, they did a really good job with it.
Special thanks especially to Jason MacDonald,

00:06:34.515 --> 00:06:40.669
who's the master craftsman at Wyrmwood, who made
both this DM screen and the table that we play on

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.948
to life. Jason, you did an amazing job. I had a
chance of meeting him at the live show, but

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:48.571
you're awesome. Another special thanks to
Critter Chris Gladis for our

00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:52.221
"How Do You Want to Do This?" calligraphy
design, which is also used on here.

00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.986
TALIESIN: Ah, too much!

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:58.050
MATT: (laughs) Chris, thank you. You did an
amazing job.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.644
TRAVIS: Give the DM some Xanax.

00:07:00.644 --> 00:07:06.048
MATT: Apparently. I think that's all I have for
announcements, right now, guys.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.561
So-- what have you done?

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:11.131
SAM: I don't know, I just found some weird
writing on--

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:13.460
LAURA: I feel like you copied that at some point.

00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:15.840
SAM: Did I copy this from something? What is this?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.084
TALIESIN: Let me see that.

00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:17.952
SAM: I don't know.

00:07:17.952 --> 00:07:20.051
LAURA: Didn't he have to copy some sort of--

00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:20.760
LIAM: Yes.

00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:24.827
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was when we were talking about
the four walls in the temple, right?

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:25.532
SAM: Ah, okay.

00:07:25.532 --> 00:07:27.962
MATT: I like the idea that you sleep-rune
sometimes.

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:29.912
MARISHA: I knew that this day would come.

00:07:29.912 --> 00:07:32.722
LIAM: (imitating record played backwards)
Thank you, Satan.

00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:36.284
MATT: Officially played too much D&amp;D.
Not possible.

00:07:36.294 --> 00:07:37.933
LAURA: Not possible.

00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:44.774
MATT: Anyway, I think with that, we can go ahead
and bring ourselves into tonight's episode of

00:07:44.774 --> 00:07:47.902
Critical Role.

00:07:48.692 --> 00:07:50.664
[water bubbling]

00:07:50.934 --> 00:07:56.076
[thunder]

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:58.508
[explosion]

00:07:58.668 --> 00:08:03.044
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:08:03.044 --> 00:08:10.716
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:08:10.716 --> 00:08:20.536
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:28.213
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:08:28.213 --> 00:08:32.269
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:41.821
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:48.974
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration
is waiting, rise up, don't think twice.

00:08:48.974 --> 00:08:53.237
Put your fate in your hands,
take a chance, roll the dice!

00:08:53.237 --> 00:09:01.007
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:05.747
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you
answer the call? Diggin' deep in your soul

00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:16.295
as the legend unfolds.
Now it's your turn to roll!

00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:24.534
[fire burning]

00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:34.775
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. Last we left off,
The Mighty Nein had been returning from

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:43.055
Nicodranas. They had made their way northward from
the Menagerie Coast, left their ship in the care

00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:48.666
of their favorite tortle to earn money
at sea while you're away.

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:49.856
LIAM: I like tortles.

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:58.287
MATT: You made your way northward, past the Wuyun
Gorge, back into the Dwendalian Empire. Passed

00:09:58.287 --> 00:10:05.309
through Trostenwald and Alfield and met up with
Bryce for a bit to catch up, and then made your

00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:12.293
way toward Felderwin. Upon arriving, you
discovered the city was still visibly scarred from

00:10:12.293 --> 00:10:19.053
the recent assault that it had seemed to suffer at
the hands of the Kryn Dynasty from Xhorhas.

00:10:19.053 --> 00:10:28.333
Upon perusing the streets, you came to discover that
the location that Nott was leading you towards was

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:37.164
in ashes: this apothecary. Upon inspecting the
vicinity, you did not find a body, but you did

00:10:37.164 --> 00:10:44.324
find a basement where you found ruined furniture,
a few traps, a chest, and a mysterious chair that

00:10:44.324 --> 00:10:47.402
has grabbed the nation's imagination.

00:10:47.403 --> 00:10:49.094
SAM: (whispering) Chair'otoa.

00:10:49.094 --> 00:10:51.244
TRAVIS: (whispering) What is the chair?

00:10:51.249 --> 00:10:54.839
[laughter]

00:10:54.839 --> 00:11:05.183
MATT: Y'all going to die. You thought the gazebo
was bad. Anyway. So.

00:11:05.183 --> 00:11:07.583
TRAVIS: Did we put the chair in the
bag of holding?

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.079
SAM: We should've.

00:11:14.114 --> 00:11:20.317
MATT: However, you also found that apparently the
person who previously had lived there was nowhere

00:11:20.317 --> 00:11:28.022
to be found, and the son of that individual was
being held at a nearby home of another person who

00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:35.008
lives here in Felderwin. You went there with Nott,
Nott took the form of a halfling and proceeded to

00:11:35.008 --> 00:11:46.563
speak to this child as her son. After a bit of
interesting conversation and curiosity, you said

00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:55.615
goodbye and you turned to find these two powerful
magic users that Caleb had identified as members

00:11:55.615 --> 00:12:02.214
of the Cerberus Assembly were walking their way
towards the ashen ruins of the apothecary, deep in

00:12:02.214 --> 00:12:12.541
conversation. That is where we left off. So,
Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:18.223
LIAM: Before we leap in, could you give a quick
physical description again of the two archmages?

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:28.432
MATT: Yes, I can do that. We have Lady Vess
DeRogna. Yes. She's an elven woman in fine flowing

00:12:28.432 --> 00:12:35.638
clothes of green and black, deep green with black
designs across and around the edges of the

00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:42.443
billowing sleeves. Jewelry around the fingers, a
number of rings and a series of necklaces.

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:47.925
They each contain some sort of a circular gem
that dangles from them like a little collection of

00:12:47.925 --> 00:12:57.531
colors. She has short, medium brown hair, and
appears to be of not a young elven age

00:12:57.531 --> 00:13:04.656
necessarily, but not as old as her current
compatriot, which is Martinet Lunidus Da'leth,

00:13:04.657 --> 00:13:10.363
who is the Archmage of Domestic Protections.
He had long, white hair.

00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:11.420
LIAM: Also elven?

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.237
MATT: Also elven. They are both elven.

00:13:13.237 --> 00:13:14.357
LAURA: Deep blue robes!

00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:22.486
MATT: Yep, keeping tabs on that. That's really the
extent of what you can see at this distance.

00:13:22.527 --> 00:13:36.955
You are currently a few houses down, standing
outside of Old Edith's house, and in the moment

00:13:36.955 --> 00:13:44.701
of the tension of the conversation you had just
had and the intensity of Nott's disposition,

00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:50.007
glancing and seeing them walking up and stopping
right at the cusp and talking to each other.

00:13:50.007 --> 00:13:53.685
LIAM: At the apothecary, not where we are?
Two separate locations.

00:13:53.686 --> 00:13:54.486
MATT: Yes.

00:13:58.496 --> 00:14:01.034
LIAM: We need to go now. Right now.

00:14:01.034 --> 00:14:06.934
SAM: Yes. Yes, we should get off the
streets right away.

00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:10.457
LIAM: These things we have, we
have to get them out of here.

00:14:10.457 --> 00:14:17.605
SAM: I know a place we can go. We can go to
near the river. There's a river near here.

00:14:17.605 --> 00:14:18.775
LAURA: Lead the way.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:19.723
LIAM: Now, please.

00:14:19.724 --> 00:14:21.895
SAM: Okay. How far is the river?

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:25.204
MATT: From where you're standing here, not
terribly far, maybe a ten minute walk.

00:14:25.205 --> 00:14:27.137
LAURA: Is it the opposite direction of the
hmm-hmm?

00:14:27.137 --> 00:14:31.712
MATT: You could loop around a bit, probably
go southward. You're not that far from the

00:14:31.712 --> 00:14:38.061
Samir River. You can scoot a southwestern
direction in an arc, probably make it

00:14:38.061 --> 00:14:40.269
15 minutes to avoid them entirely.

00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:42.581
LAURA: Take the cart too, huh?

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:43.542
SAM: Yes.

00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:44.982
LAURA: Let's go.

00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:49.531
SAM: I will lead them to a spot on the
river bank that I know.

00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:58.810
MATT: All right. Moving past the handful of people
in the city that are noticing this strange band of

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:04.248
adventurers that have wandered through, you make
your way past the outskirts and you can see the

00:15:04.249 --> 00:15:11.946
river itself cruising right along. It would be a
beautiful landscape if there wasn't this intensity

00:15:11.946 --> 00:15:21.196
of emotion and the distant haze of long-grayed
smoke that still hangs over the vicinity of the

00:15:21.196 --> 00:15:26.704
partially burned farmlands. Nevertheless, Nott
leads you over towards one of the shaded banks

00:15:26.704 --> 00:15:30.059
under a few trees and you come to a stop.

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:31.562
MARISHA: Are we being followed?

00:15:31.562 --> 00:15:33.014
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:15:33.014 --> 00:15:37.313
TRAVIS: First roll of the night, no fucking
pressure. First roll of the night, you got this.

00:15:37.313 --> 00:15:41.466
MARISHA: That didn't count. That's good! 21.

00:15:41.466 --> 00:15:50.449
MATT: Glancing about, you do not see anybody
keeping watch. What you do notice, however, is

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:58.438
that a lot of the patrolling Righteous Brand, the
small bands that have been keeping tabs, are all

00:15:58.438 --> 00:16:06.513
gathering towards the southern edge where the farm
fields of the Felderwin Tillage hit the town of

00:16:06.513 --> 00:16:10.763
Felderwin. Where as they were scattered,
they're all amassing in one space.

00:16:10.763 --> 00:16:18.024
LIAM: We heard someone describe the operatives
from Xhorhas coming up out of the ground

00:16:18.024 --> 00:16:20.042
over by the farmlands, correct?

00:16:20.042 --> 00:16:23.493
MATT: Correct. That's as much as you've heard.

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:29.063
LAURA: So hey, what the fuck?

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:38.940
LIAM: Yeah, that's a good question, but also we
just stole some very important things and we saw

00:16:38.941 --> 00:16:44.519
what is probably the owners going into the
building. Is there anything we need to do in this

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:50.423
town now to help you do what you need to
do here, or can we leave?

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:59.500
SAM: No, we can't leave. No, we can't leave.
I mean, you can leave, but I need to stay.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.954
LIAM: Is this person you're looking for here,
do you know? Do you have any ideas?

00:17:06.157 --> 00:17:13.556
SAM: I don't know, but I know that-- I don't know.
I don't know where he is, but I know that we'll

00:17:13.557 --> 00:17:22.921
find clues here or we may find clues here. I need
to look. I need to look and I need to start

00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:27.419
right away, and I suppose you all can go
if you want, but--

00:17:27.448 --> 00:17:28.997
LAURA: I will stay and help you.

00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:32.429
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll stay. Caleb, are you
worried about another attack?

00:17:33.155 --> 00:17:35.115
LAURA: What are you so nervous about?

00:17:35.145 --> 00:17:37.067
TALIESIN: We are a target.

00:17:38.544 --> 00:17:41.086
LIAM: We were being stared at as we
came through here.

00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:49.783
TALIESIN: I think we need somewhere safe to talk.
I think there's a lot of things we need to cement up.

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:55.404
SAM: This is about as quiet a spot as I know in town,
I don't want to go to a pub or anything.

00:17:55.404 --> 00:17:59.023
TALIESIN: No, obviously not. We need privacy.

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:14.039
LAURA: I mean, you're just here to check on
your son? That's a good cover, I guess.

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:19.558
Was it your son, or are you even a goblin?

00:18:20.035 --> 00:18:25.078
SAM: Okay, all right. So you probably have some
questions for me and that's all right.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.028
TRAVIS: One or two.

00:18:26.028 --> 00:18:27.449
MARISHA: Like a thousand.

00:18:28.033 --> 00:18:31.200
LAURA: I mean, if it's your son,
that's really sad, Nott.

00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:37.278
SAM: I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for
surprising you back there, and I'm sorry

00:18:37.278 --> 00:18:41.481
that I didn't tell you more before.

00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:42.966
LAURA: Are you okay?

00:18:42.966 --> 00:19:00.022
SAM: I don't know, but I feel like-- I don't think
any of us need to pretend that we all don't have

00:19:00.022 --> 00:19:09.770
some secrets. We've all been keeping some secrets
from each other. Sometimes I feel like even maybe

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:18.048
the thing that brought us together is that
we're bonded by dishonesty, a little bit?

00:19:18.048 --> 00:19:20.329
TALIESIN: Not me, no secrets, open book.

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:22.929
LAURA: I'm pretty open, too.

00:19:23.783 --> 00:19:25.027
MARISHA: I hear you.

00:19:26.738 --> 00:19:40.047
SAM: Well, some of us, anyway. For me, anyway,
I've been holding onto some secrets. I feel like

00:19:40.047 --> 00:19:47.359
it's almost like putting up an armor or something
to protect you from the past, or from regrets or

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:59.743
something, and I feel like for some of us, it
could also be like a chain, weighing us down and

00:19:59.743 --> 00:20:14.002
keeping us from moving forward. Maybe it's time
now to remove that chain and be open and honest so

00:20:14.002 --> 00:20:24.047
that we can move ahead. So yes. I'll tell you what
you want to know. What do you want to know?

00:20:26.729 --> 00:20:28.004
TRAVIS: Are you a goblin?

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.501
LAURA: Is that your son for real?

00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:48.826
SAM: Okay. Well, hi. My name is Nott the Brave and
I am a little goblin girl, but once upon a time, I

00:20:48.826 --> 00:21:14.821
was Veth, a young halfling woman and before that,
a halfling child who grew up being told that she

00:21:14.821 --> 00:21:27.245
was not pretty and not brave and not coordinated
and not smart, and just not.

00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:32.235
LAURA: And that's you? This is how you looked?

00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:35.058
SAM: Yeah.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.331
LAURA: But you're so pretty!

00:21:38.655 --> 00:21:53.470
SAM: I was. Then, you know, time went by and I got
a little bit older. I was made fun of quite a bit.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:22:03.333
I had this-- People thought I was strange because
I collected things. I had lots of collections.

00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:10.865
They were really outstanding. I collected wax
seals and pieces of colored paper and

00:22:10.865 --> 00:22:14.112
some buttons and fabric.

00:22:14.112 --> 00:22:16.057
MARISHA: You collected wax seals?

00:22:16.057 --> 00:22:17.309
SAM: All kinds, yeah.

00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:18.966
MARISHA: You still have those?

00:22:19.662 --> 00:22:21.061
SAM: I'm afraid not.

00:22:21.668 --> 00:22:23.514
MARISHA: That's cool, actually.

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:34.160
SAM: They didn't think so. I had brothers and
people in town who would ridicule me.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.559
LAURA: That was here?

00:22:35.617 --> 00:22:47.460
SAM: Yes, I lived here. One day, I was playing a
game with some other boys and they dared

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.120
one of their friends to give me a kiss.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.012
LAURA: Spin the Bottle!

00:22:55.662 --> 00:23:04.372
SAM: The boy was very nice and he actually seemed
to like it! He and I became friendly and

00:23:06.442 --> 00:23:12.572
eventually, we did what people do and
got married.

00:23:13.169 --> 00:23:17.701
MARISHA: Oh, that's not-- I went somewhere else.
Yeah, married! Yeah!

00:23:18.912 --> 00:23:29.360
SAM: He didn't mind my strangeness and I helped
him get his apothecary up and running. He was a

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:37.919
brilliant chemist and could make acids and potions
and oils and bleaches for fabrics and dyes and all

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:48.722
sorts of things. I helped him and he took care of
me. Eventually, we had a baby named Luke and he

00:23:48.722 --> 00:23:56.123
was a bright boy. Very smart, he learned to talk
very early and walk very early. Such a smart boy!

00:24:00.162 --> 00:24:04.337
That's who you saw back there is my son.

00:24:05.214 --> 00:24:10.741
LAURA: So was he right? Did you die?

00:24:13.707 --> 00:24:28.801
SAM: I think so. We had a rough winter in
Felderwin. There was not a lot of crops. I think

00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:41.487
some of the animals had died that winter. This
river I've brought you to, this is a beautiful

00:24:41.488 --> 00:24:49.967
place. I used to come here with Yeza. It's also an
important place because this is the-- the goblins

00:24:49.967 --> 00:25:00.923
would come from over there. They would come and
raid us from the other side of the river. I think

00:25:00.923 --> 00:25:10.624
after that winter, they got particularly hungry
and more dangerous and more daring. They came into

00:25:10.624 --> 00:25:19.939
town and raided more and more until, one day, they
took us. They took me and my husband and my child.

00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:34.174
They held us in one of their camps. I don't know
if it was days or weeks. I'm not sure. Luke was

00:25:34.174 --> 00:25:41.202
not doing well. He was starting to starve, and I knew
that we needed to get out of there somehow.

00:25:43.238 --> 00:25:56.224
Yeza is a very bright man, but he's not a fighter.
So I had to do what I had to do. We ran in the

00:25:56.224 --> 00:26:05.593
dead of night. They weren't fast. I've been chased
a lot in my life by boys making fun of me.

00:26:07.295 --> 00:26:17.484
I'm pretty fast. So I told them to run to the river
and I broke off and I ran a different way.

00:26:18.775 --> 00:26:33.461
The goblins followed me. When they found me, they
surrounded me and I fought. I had a vial of acid that

00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:45.948
Yeza had handed me and I threw it in the face of
the one trying to catch us. They didn't like that.

00:26:47.419 --> 00:26:58.205
They took me back to their camp. I think he died
from his wounds, and he was something like their

00:26:58.218 --> 00:27:12.196
leader and he had a wife. She brought me to
another woman in a hood. A magic woman.

00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:21.655
I don't know who she was; I never saw her eyes or
anything. This goblin told the woman, "Make her

00:27:21.655 --> 00:27:39.855
"suffer," and they did. They brought me to this
river and they drowned me in it. I can still feel

00:27:39.855 --> 00:28:12.302
the water in my lungs and my ears and my nose. And
then nothing until I woke up and saw the hands,

00:28:13.042 --> 00:28:22.832
those hands, the skin. Then I looked in a puddle.
I could see what they made me. They made me

00:28:24.893 --> 00:28:51.123
everything that I thought I was: not pretty, not
good, just not. I'll be honest. I've started

00:28:51.123 --> 00:28:58.163
forgetting what it feels like to be a halfling, to
be me. I don't remember everything any more.

00:28:58.522 --> 00:29:11.465
I feel like every day I'm more and more goblin. I
don't like it at all. I don't like myself at all.

00:29:14.055 --> 00:29:22.192
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry I lied, and
I'm sorry, Caleb, that I didn't tell you.

00:29:25.342 --> 00:29:39.523
I should've told you. You would've understood, and
maybe you could've helped me. I don't know. I feel

00:29:39.523 --> 00:29:51.119
like you're almost there. Almost strong enough to
help, but I didn't want to distract you from your path.

00:29:56.079 --> 00:30:09.847
Anyway. That's how I got to you. That's why I
can't be in that town and he can't see me like

00:30:09.862 --> 00:30:14.169
this, my son can't see me like this.
No one there can.

00:30:15.403 --> 00:30:21.207
TALIESIN: Does your husband know?
Does he not know?

00:30:22.078 --> 00:30:23.741
SAM: I've sent him things.

00:30:24.067 --> 00:30:25.665
TALIESIN: So he knows you're alive.

00:30:25.728 --> 00:30:35.926
SAM: Well, I only recently started signing the
letters. I don't know if he believes it or not.

00:30:37.078 --> 00:30:44.148
I don't know what he would think of me. The people
in that town, they're taught to kill a goblin on

00:30:44.148 --> 00:30:55.213
sight or run and get help. Children are
told rhymes. If he saw me like this,

00:30:55.213 --> 00:30:58.428
I don't even know if he would believe it's me.

00:30:58.627 --> 00:31:06.120
TALIESIN: He'll know you. Nott, you ran and got
help and here we are. It's the right thing to do.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.581
We're here to help.

00:31:08.827 --> 00:31:10.432
LAURA: How long has it been?

00:31:11.526 --> 00:31:27.008
SAM: Since I've been like this? Well, they turned
me and then they kept me around. They used me like

00:31:27.008 --> 00:31:43.432
a slave, really. I would clean out their messes and
clean up after the meals. I would help their one

00:31:43.432 --> 00:31:57.411
that tortured. I would help him for months. Maybe
six months. Then I ran. That's when I found you,

00:31:57.411 --> 00:32:10.130
shortly after, so maybe a year? No. More. More
than a year. Year and a half? I don't know.

00:32:12.825 --> 00:32:15.886
Not exactly. It's all sort of a blur.

00:32:20.403 --> 00:32:23.309
LAURA: I feel like we can get this fixed.

00:32:23.655 --> 00:32:24.915
TALIESIN: We're here now.

00:32:24.915 --> 00:32:26.238
LAURA: We can do something.

00:32:26.523 --> 00:32:30.693
TALIESIN: We just have to take some time,
think carefully and slowly.

00:32:30.693 --> 00:32:34.663
SAM: I don't think we have time. He's
gone. They could be killing him now,

00:32:34.663 --> 00:32:36.108
these people that have him.

00:32:37.138 --> 00:32:40.562
TRAVIS: Do we know who we think that is?

00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:44.289
LAURA: Is it the people you know?

00:32:46.443 --> 00:32:53.046
LIAM: Is anyone else-- Is there anyone
coming? Do we hear anything?

00:32:53.046 --> 00:32:54.696
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:32:56.686 --> 00:32:58.366
LIAM: Natural one.

00:32:59.546 --> 00:33:03.861
MATT: Your emotions are transfixed
and even though you look around,

00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:07.701
your attention's still focused on Nott.
Nothing catches your eye.

00:33:11.697 --> 00:33:19.976
TALIESIN: We can do something about this, but
you're going to have to trust us and you're going

00:33:19.976 --> 00:33:28.182
to have to be careful because if we move too
quickly, we're just going to go running the

00:33:28.182 --> 00:33:34.747
wrong direction and alone. And you need help.

00:33:39.356 --> 00:33:45.975
SAM: I will try to restrain myself, but honestly,
I don't know for how long.

00:33:47.706 --> 00:33:50.185
TALIESIN: Would it help if we cleared your head?

00:33:51.214 --> 00:33:52.546
SAM: What do you mean?

00:33:52.595 --> 00:34:04.786
TALIESIN: Well, if you need a minute to be here,
we maybe sift some of the contents of that flask

00:34:04.786 --> 00:34:11.296
out of you for a little while. Just for a minute.
You can get back to it when you need it,

00:34:11.295 --> 00:34:18.435
but for now, maybe impulse may not be
your friend right now.

00:34:19.485 --> 00:34:22.446
SAM: Okay. If you think so, Mr. Clay.

00:34:22.485 --> 00:34:26.045
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and do that. We had a
brief conversation about that last week.

00:34:26.714 --> 00:34:28.757
MATT: So you're casting Lesser Restoration?

00:34:28.757 --> 00:34:29.626
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:34:29.626 --> 00:34:30.365
MATT: Okay.

00:34:30.366 --> 00:34:31.795
LAURA: Try to un-drunk Nott.

00:34:31.795 --> 00:34:33.771
MATT: Technically alcohol is a toxin.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.321
TALIESIN: I have to know what it is.
I have to be going for it.

00:34:37.321 --> 00:34:39.194
MATT: Yeah, so I'll allow it.

00:34:40.255 --> 00:34:41.801
TALIESIN: I am so sorry.

00:34:42.902 --> 00:34:48.800
MATT: You feel this warm glow emanating from
Caduceus' hands and then in that moment, the fuzzy

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:57.104
numbness that you are accustomed to sitting in,
especially in places of great fear or emotion, fades.

00:34:57.601 --> 00:34:59.792
And everything's back to being crystal clear.

00:35:00.997 --> 00:35:03.719
TALIESIN: Sometimes the truth takes a little while
to get there.

00:35:03.795 --> 00:35:09.336
SAM: This feels much worse. It feels terrible,
actually. This is terrible. This is how you all are,

00:35:09.336 --> 00:35:11.408
all the time? This is not fun.

00:35:11.548 --> 00:35:12.580
TRAVIS: Majority.

00:35:13.324 --> 00:35:14.081
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:35:14.638 --> 00:35:16.620
MARISHA: Nott, I know this place is--

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.115
LAURA: Do you want some candy?

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:19.359
SAM: Yes, lots.

00:35:19.579 --> 00:35:27.280
MARISHA: This place is quiet, but do you actually
know if there a waterfall upstream a little bit,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.457
or a brook? Something with some noise that
might drown out anyone who's listening.

00:35:33.509 --> 00:35:35.892
TALIESIN: Maybe somewhere where
we can sleep, too.

00:35:36.732 --> 00:35:40.291
MARISHA: Further off the beaten path.
We walk upstream, maybe?

00:35:40.406 --> 00:35:42.171
SAM: Is there such a place?

00:35:42.171 --> 00:35:46.894
MATT: There's not much in the way of a waterfall,
unfortunately. You're in the center of the valley,

00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:54.031
so what hills there are, are just hills. The river
here continues cutting through the valley, but

00:35:54.032 --> 00:36:01.532
you're probably a good, off the top of my head,
40 or so miles from any elevation to cause

00:36:01.532 --> 00:36:02.832
a major waterfall.

00:36:02.832 --> 00:36:04.944
MARISHA: Any babbling brooks?

00:36:04.944 --> 00:36:09.075
MATT: You're next to the river and what
little noise it's making. It's nice.

00:36:09.145 --> 00:36:11.075
TALIESIN: We know that there are tunnels.

00:36:11.985 --> 00:36:14.082
LIAM: By the farmlands.

00:36:14.973 --> 00:36:18.235
MARISHA: Which is, I think, where
all those soldiers were going.

00:36:18.404 --> 00:36:25.067
TALIESIN: Well, maybe we should find somewhere in
town to hold up, and we'll keep you out of sight.

00:36:25.329 --> 00:36:30.295
MATT: There was that one inn that burned down, but
there is one inn you know called the Goldfield

00:36:30.295 --> 00:36:40.764
Tavern and Lodge. That's one of the more traveled
inns. A lot of people that come in and out of

00:36:40.764 --> 00:36:43.343
Felderwin, that's one of the more popular
destinations.

00:36:44.188 --> 00:36:46.134
TALIESIN: What's your husband's name?

00:36:46.314 --> 00:36:47.768
SAM: Yeza Brenatto.

00:36:48.569 --> 00:36:54.015
TALIESIN: I think, perhaps, if we're going to, we
should come together with a game plan. I think it

00:36:54.015 --> 00:36:59.649
would be respectable if people thought that
someone was looking for Yeza in his interests.

00:36:59.649 --> 00:37:04.731
People will be less suspicious if we're asking
questions about someone who disappeared, if we

00:37:04.731 --> 00:37:13.944
were perhaps hired by a trust fund of your son or
otherwise, and this is something that is owed to him.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.429
It's just business; we don't have to let them
know it's personal.

00:37:17.459 --> 00:37:19.240
TRAVIS: That's actually very clever.

00:37:19.468 --> 00:37:29.942
SAM: That's fine, but-- and I'm sorry, Caleb. I'm
sorry for what I said before. I feel like part of

00:37:29.943 --> 00:37:38.543
what we'll need to do to find him is to know
what he was doing before he was taken,

00:37:38.543 --> 00:37:40.561
and that involves you.

00:37:41.156 --> 00:37:46.417
MARISHA: Yeah, you definitely puked all over that
apothecary, so it's clear that something's not right.

00:37:46.643 --> 00:37:52.922
SAM: I don't want to force you to do anything you
don't want to, but I need you now. I need you to

00:37:52.922 --> 00:38:00.274
tell me what you know, what these people might be
doing, or might have taken him to, or done with him.

00:38:00.865 --> 00:38:03.247
LAURA: I mean, it does seem like they were
using him.

00:38:06.458 --> 00:38:08.339
MARISHA: What is dunamis?

00:38:10.174 --> 00:38:11.632
LAURA: How do you know them?

00:38:13.223 --> 00:38:17.682
TALIESIN: That's a lot. You can take
your time. As you're ready.

00:38:18.624 --> 00:38:20.913
LIAM: Are we going to...

00:38:24.632 --> 00:38:26.763
SAM: Do you want to get somewhere safer first?

00:38:28.892 --> 00:38:36.230
TRAVIS: Further away? Why don't we keep
moving upstream? What's the direction

00:38:36.234 --> 00:38:37.766
away from the conflict?

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:44.163
MATT: There's northeast and southwest. Northeast
would be more in the direction of the fields and

00:38:44.166 --> 00:38:49.430
clearer view. Southwest would be further away from
civilization.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:54.888
TALIESIN: I'll also say, we can start the wagon
up, and I can drive and keep an eye out. If you're

00:38:54.888 --> 00:38:57.486
all inside the wagon, no one's going
to see any of you.

00:38:58.501 --> 00:39:00.265
TRAVIS: Sure, let's head south.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.457
MARISHA: Let's find a patch of woods to hide in.

00:39:04.687 --> 00:39:05.947
LAURA: Are there woods?

00:39:06.044 --> 00:39:08.562
MATT: There's little clusters of trees
here and there.

00:39:08.773 --> 00:39:12.655
TALIESIN: It may be, in the end, safer staying in
town. People staying in the woods seem like

00:39:12.655 --> 00:39:18.121
they're trying to avoid something, and there's a
lot of soldiers. If you're on business, you go to

00:39:18.121 --> 00:39:27.637
town, even if the town's a little rough. We'll
keep going around. When it's time to go, I think

00:39:27.637 --> 00:39:32.828
maybe we go into town and get a room. Maybe
make a little bubble in the room, if we have to.

00:39:33.895 --> 00:39:36.137
LIAM: I don't want to talk in town.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:42.484
TALIESIN: We're going to take a scenic route.
I'll take a long time, and if I see people,

00:39:42.485 --> 00:39:44.304
I'm not going to drive towards them.

00:39:44.497 --> 00:39:47.699
TRAVIS: Before we go, are you sure your
son is safe with this--

00:39:47.699 --> 00:39:50.201
SAM: No, I'm not sure at all.

00:39:50.377 --> 00:39:53.613
TRAVIS: What did you tell her last?
Are they staying? Are they going?

00:39:53.613 --> 00:39:59.212
SAM: They're staying. I gave them some money.
Edith seemed to think that they were okay for the

00:39:59.213 --> 00:40:03.639
time being and that there's not going to be any
more imminent attacks.

00:40:03.639 --> 00:40:07.707
TRAVIS: Do other people in town know that old
Edith cares for your son, that they're connected

00:40:07.707 --> 00:40:08.826
in some way?

00:40:08.826 --> 00:40:09.755
SAM: No idea.

00:40:09.755 --> 00:40:13.065
MARISHA: Does old Edith know your current form?

00:40:14.654 --> 00:40:15.934
SAM: No one does.

00:40:16.984 --> 00:40:20.612
MARISHA: She just thinks you're not dead.

00:40:22.959 --> 00:40:24.446
SAM: Well, I'm not.

00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:29.816
LIAM: What do you think that your child
made of that?

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:48.725
SAM: I don't know, but I know that I needed to see
him. I forgot what he looked like, and he forgot

00:40:48.725 --> 00:41:07.163
what I looked like. I feel like that's impossible.
That's unsustainable. We need to know the ones we

00:41:07.163 --> 00:41:15.751
love, and I don't know what that was. I don't know
how he felt, but for me it's a step. As painful as

00:41:15.751 --> 00:41:19.720
it was, it will be a step towards something.

00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:32.379
MARISHA: Nott, you drowned. You drowned, and you
just spent three months underwater.

00:41:34.999 --> 00:41:43.441
That's incredible. I don't know if you
realize that, but--

00:41:46.282 --> 00:41:55.430
SAM: Yeah, it was great. It was-- it sucked.
It was terrible.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.591
TALIESIN: It was very brave.

00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:01.490
SAM: You guys have rubbed off on me, I guess.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:08.191
TRAVIS: I don't want to tell you what to do, but I
feel like our previous experience would lean

00:42:08.191 --> 00:42:14.821
towards getting your son and her out of here,
especially if the people that have taken your

00:42:14.822 --> 00:42:20.212
husband are still here. If they're searching
for answers or asking people questions,

00:42:20.212 --> 00:42:22.062
that could lead to her and him.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:27.591
LAURA: They could go stay with my mama. They could
stay at the Lavish Chateau for the time being.

00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:29.572
TALIESIN: Anywhere west, really.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:31.602
TRAVIS: Now's the time to move them.

00:42:33.612 --> 00:42:42.911
SAM: Right. How? How would I convince--

00:42:44.052 --> 00:42:48.665
TRAVIS: Maybe it's not you. Maybe one of us go.

00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:52.294
SAM: Go to tell them?

00:42:52.294 --> 00:42:53.102
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:42:54.051 --> 00:42:55.273
TALIESIN: Not a bad idea.

00:42:55.273 --> 00:42:59.561
SAM: How do they get there? It's a dangerous
journey, even for us. You saw the borders.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.542
MARISHA: Loops into Caduceus' social worker plan,
actually.

00:43:04.334 --> 00:43:08.754
TALIESIN: I don't know if necessarily crossing the
border is the way to go, but at least going

00:43:08.755 --> 00:43:09.748
further inland.

00:43:09.749 --> 00:43:13.919
TRAVIS: If they do decide to cross, I think
they're less concerned with people going out

00:43:13.919 --> 00:43:15.332
more than coming in.

00:43:18.076 --> 00:43:22.604
SAM: Do we know any place safe closer?
Is Alfield safe?

00:43:25.005 --> 00:43:26.309
TALIESIN: Safe as anything.

00:43:26.745 --> 00:43:28.100
LAURA: Bryce is there.

00:43:29.875 --> 00:43:34.991
TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea. Send a letter.
Ask Bryce if they can take care of this.

00:43:35.448 --> 00:43:42.112
MARISHA: Do you think Bryce would be down for more
responsibility and obligations?

00:43:42.763 --> 00:43:48.263
TALIESIN: I imagine, if we pack a few gold in.
It's not much to find some room and board for a

00:43:48.263 --> 00:43:49.312
couple people.

00:43:49.312 --> 00:43:50.662
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.

00:43:50.662 --> 00:43:54.812
TRAVIS: If it does continue to drift that way,
Bryce will be sure to get them out quick.

00:43:54.813 --> 00:43:55.950
TALIESIN: Or send word.

00:43:56.584 --> 00:44:02.223
MARISHA: Plus, Alfield is near the border and the
gates. Shorter journey out.

00:44:03.293 --> 00:44:08.302
LAURA: I could send a message, see if Bryce
would be okay with that. What do you think?

00:44:08.671 --> 00:44:10.332
SAM: Okay, yes. Please do.

00:44:10.332 --> 00:44:14.343
TRAVIS: There's a lot to figure. This will
be one less thing to worry about.

00:44:15.982 --> 00:44:19.223
MARISHA: Then we try to find Yeza?

00:44:21.851 --> 00:44:24.565
SAM: Absolutely. Yes.

00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:38.316
LAURA: I'm going to not be able to do this
in 25 words. It's so hard!

00:44:38.566 --> 00:44:39.663
MATT: Cast it twice.

00:44:39.663 --> 00:44:41.157
TRAVIS: This is going to Bryce?

00:44:41.157 --> 00:44:44.071
LAURA: This is going to Bryce. Okay.

00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:46.304
SAM: I believe in you, Jester. You can do this.

00:44:46.304 --> 00:44:49.426
TRAVIS: Woman and child incoming.
Take care of them.

00:44:49.768 --> 00:44:53.825
LAURA: Oh, that's good. Don't talk in full
sentences. Why didn't I think of that?!

00:44:54.261 --> 00:44:54.976
TALIESIN: Stop.

00:44:55.876 --> 00:44:57.065
LAURA: Do I say stop?

00:44:57.065 --> 00:44:57.778
TALIESIN: Stop.

00:44:57.778 --> 00:44:59.346
TRAVIS: Don't waste it on a stop.

00:44:59.347 --> 00:45:02.729
TALIESIN: I mean, that's what you would do
if you're doing the telegram.

00:45:02.729 --> 00:45:05.528
LAURA: I could just vocally stop because
Bryce will hear me.

00:45:05.528 --> 00:45:06.240
TALIESIN: Stop.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.627
LAURA. Right. Okay. I'm going to cast Sending.

00:45:17.328 --> 00:45:18.308
LAURA: Hello.

00:45:18.308 --> 00:45:19.117
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

00:45:20.647 --> 00:45:33.392
LAURA: It's Jester. Two people incoming. A
woman and child. Take care of them, please?

00:45:33.392 --> 00:45:36.006
We're sending money with them.

00:45:38.717 --> 00:45:40.545
SAM: You have two more words.

00:45:40.576 --> 00:45:43.289
LAURA: This is important.

00:45:44.911 --> 00:45:46.043
LIAM: Cut off the "is".

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.899
LAURA: I thought I had five more words!

00:45:47.899 --> 00:45:49.042
MATT: You have two more.

00:45:49.042 --> 00:45:49.964
LAURA: Okay.

00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:52.907
TALIESIN: Signed... oh.

00:45:52.961 --> 00:45:53.930
LAURA: Please help.

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:58.364
MARISHA: Is it one word? Pleasehelp!

00:45:59.243 --> 00:46:05.653
MATT: As the sporadic phrases make their way
through the arcane weaves of the various magical

00:46:05.653 --> 00:46:12.933
ley lines that invisibly traverse the exterior of
Exandria, they make their way towards Bryce's ear

00:46:12.933 --> 00:46:24.724
somewhere in Alfield, and they respond, a
moment later, "All right. I'll do my best.

00:46:28.674 --> 00:46:31.913
"Please don't send too many more?"

00:46:32.198 --> 00:46:37.232
(laughter)

00:46:37.232 --> 00:46:38.295
MATT: That was it.

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:41.222
LAURA: Okay. I think they're going to help!

00:46:41.907 --> 00:46:43.761
SAM: Okay. That's something.

00:46:43.761 --> 00:46:47.951
TRAVIS: Bryce is shaking their head, trying to
get better reception and it's not working.

00:46:47.968 --> 00:46:49.120
TALIESIN: Water in the ear.

00:46:49.121 --> 00:46:51.103
MARISHA: You're cutting out and I can't--

00:46:53.404 --> 00:46:55.478
LAURA: Okay. Oh, sorry about that.

00:46:56.195 --> 00:46:57.358
TALIESIN: It's nothing.

00:46:58.209 --> 00:47:00.149
SAM: So, shall we ride around a bit?

00:47:00.698 --> 00:47:03.455
LAURA: Yes, because I want to hear
what Caleb has to say.

00:47:03.456 --> 00:47:08.513
TALIESIN: I also want to get a sense of things, so
we're going to take a lazy meander around the

00:47:08.513 --> 00:47:12.761
area. I want to get a sense of where things are,
get a map in my head, and I'm going to be

00:47:12.762 --> 00:47:14.098
paying very close attention.

00:47:14.098 --> 00:47:15.228
MATT: Through the city?

00:47:15.228 --> 00:47:16.709
TALIESIN: No, on the outskirts.

00:47:16.709 --> 00:47:19.508
MATT: Okay. It'll take you a while.

00:47:19.573 --> 00:47:23.020
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep going around
until they...

00:47:24.627 --> 00:47:29.533
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check for me,
Caduceus, as you guys are passing around the

00:47:29.533 --> 00:47:32.747
southern edge, heading towards the
western side of Felderwin.

00:47:37.486 --> 00:47:42.728
TALIESIN: That's okay, it's all right. Eight.
Wait, no, I'm so sorry, that's wrong. 13.

00:47:42.978 --> 00:47:52.701
MATT: Okay. Keeping an eye out, the main thing you
notice, it seems like a majority of the Righteous

00:47:52.701 --> 00:47:58.788
Brand have gathered and are heading northeast.
They are leaving Felderwin.

00:47:59.491 --> 00:48:00.678
MARISHA: Leaving.

00:48:00.678 --> 00:48:01.607
MATT: Correct.

00:48:02.249 --> 00:48:05.908
TALIESIN: All right. Does it look like they've
discovered the tunnels, or no?

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.328
MATT: You don't know, you're too far away. You
haven't really asked any specific questions to the

00:48:11.328 --> 00:48:12.869
local crownsguard.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.320
TALIESIN: That'll be for civilization;
that's cool.

00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:21.285
MATT: Best you can see here-- the flames have been
long out. What brief cinders and wisps of smoke

00:48:21.285 --> 00:48:26.008
that had been slowly burning themselves out over
the past couple of weeks or so are on the very

00:48:26.008 --> 00:48:32.504
tail end. It looks like Felderwin has fallen to at
least a semblance of temporary neutrality. The

00:48:32.504 --> 00:48:38.714
people are going about their lives, the Tillage--
the damage that has been done, has been done,

00:48:38.715 --> 00:48:41.544
and now it's just trying to pick up and move on.

00:48:47.271 --> 00:48:48.737
LIAM: We're in the wagon?

00:48:48.737 --> 00:48:53.829
MATT: You're in the wagon. You're now on the
western side of the village where you can see the

00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:55.690
northward Tillage all around.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:49:00.600
TALIESIN: I'm on the lookout, and I will let
anybody know if anyone's within 60 yards.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.375
MARISHA: Are you listening, to where you can
contribute?

00:49:03.375 --> 00:49:06.802
TALIESIN: I think I'm listening, but I'm not doing
a very good job of it.

00:49:06.802 --> 00:49:08.993
TRAVIS: Because you're checking out around us.

00:49:08.993 --> 00:49:10.094
TALIESIN: Because I'm--

00:49:10.294 --> 00:49:11.591
TRAVIS: Periscoping.

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:13.265
MARISHA: Hey, Jester.

00:49:13.265 --> 00:49:13.978
LAURA: Mm?

00:49:14.592 --> 00:49:18.874
MARISHA: Since we're going to try and be honest
with each other and turn a new leaf--

00:49:20.174 --> 00:49:21.704
LAURA: Are you in love with me?

00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:31.292
MARISHA: Well, in a way. I didn't sleep with
Dairon. She wasn't my roommate.

00:49:32.062 --> 00:49:33.933
She was my teacher.

00:49:34.303 --> 00:49:35.471
LAURA: Oh.

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:37.470
MARISHA: I don't know why I told you that.

00:49:37.752 --> 00:49:38.923
LAURA: I don't either.

00:49:38.943 --> 00:49:39.833
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:49:40.003 --> 00:49:41.578
LAURA: Teachers are cool, too.

00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:45.582
SAM: You slept with your teacher?

00:49:45.884 --> 00:49:49.672
MARISHA: No, I didn't sleep with her at all.
I totally made that up.

00:49:49.672 --> 00:49:52.072
LAURA: You just cared about your teacher.

00:49:52.207 --> 00:49:53.243
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:49:53.303 --> 00:49:54.672
LAURA: Good for you.

00:49:54.672 --> 00:49:55.841
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:49:56.961 --> 00:50:00.250
SAM: I know there's more pressing matters,
but what did she teach you?

00:50:01.026 --> 00:50:03.263
MARISHA: How to kick ass and take names, bitch.

00:50:03.688 --> 00:50:04.727
SAM: Cool.

00:50:04.994 --> 00:50:05.780
TRAVIS: Snaps.

00:50:07.342 --> 00:50:12.261
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's
easier to pretend like you don't care.

00:50:13.297 --> 00:50:16.823
LAURA: Well, I figured you cared since you
were checking up on her.

00:50:17.398 --> 00:50:20.641
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm a little transparent sometimes.

00:50:21.093 --> 00:50:25.357
LAURA: (laughs) I totally thought she was your
roommate. You were really good about that.

00:50:25.358 --> 00:50:26.542
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:50:26.542 --> 00:50:27.622
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:50:27.735 --> 00:50:30.731
MARISHA: I mean, don't get me wrong. I'd totally
tap that, but--

00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:34.692
TRAVIS: All right, can we maybe circle back to the...?

00:50:41.132 --> 00:50:49.928
LAURA: Caleb. We can tell you're really scared, and
that's okay, to be scared. We just don't know why.

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:57.689
TRAVIS: Maybe if you share with us your
apprehensions, it'll ease it a bit?

00:51:05.742 --> 00:51:16.781
LIAM: (deep breath) &lt;i&gt;Mist&lt;/i&gt;.

00:51:18.831 --> 00:51:20.415
MARISHA: You got this, man.

00:51:21.505 --> 00:51:25.507
LIAM: Your name is... Veth.

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.799
SAM: It was.

00:51:34.977 --> 00:51:50.690
LIAM: My name was... Bren Aldric Ermendrud. Was.

00:52:02.858 --> 00:52:06.996
SAM: That's why you looked at me, that day.

00:52:13.701 --> 00:52:17.151
LIAM: I, uh...

00:52:21.472 --> 00:52:24.469
LAURA: Did you die, too?

00:52:27.962 --> 00:52:29.312
SAM: Twinsies?

00:52:30.655 --> 00:52:33.462
LIAM: I have been using you all.

00:52:40.611 --> 00:52:41.379
LAURA: How?

00:52:44.799 --> 00:53:04.086
LIAM: I am from Rexxentrum. I attended the
Soltryce Academy, and I was plucked by one of the

00:53:04.097 --> 00:53:15.603
Cerberus Assembly with a few others, and was
being trained to do the kinds of things that

00:53:15.603 --> 00:53:18.350
I fear may have been done to--

00:53:19.982 --> 00:53:20.913
LAURA: Yeza.

00:53:20.913 --> 00:53:34.626
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;. And.... a lot of big plans for me
that didn't pan out, and I went a little crazy.

00:53:41.748 --> 00:53:54.202
And I ran away. I ran away. I've been on the run
for a long time, and I was tired of starving.

00:53:55.233 --> 00:54:10.291
And I met... I met you and was a little less
hungry for a while. I have just been afraid for

00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:18.154
a long time, and two of the people in that town
over there are on the Cerberus Assembly.

00:54:19.242 --> 00:54:20.542
SAM: Do you know them?

00:54:22.072 --> 00:54:23.344
LIAM: I know who they are.

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.750
LAURA: Would they know who you are?

00:54:28.009 --> 00:54:35.329
LIAM: I don't think so, but I have walked past
their portraits at school many times.

00:54:36.212 --> 00:54:37.072
MARISHA: Ew.

00:54:37.118 --> 00:54:38.755
LAURA: They're high up then, huh?

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.907
LIAM: One of them is the head of the
Cerberus Assembly.

00:54:44.907 --> 00:54:45.901
LAURA: Holy shit.

00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:47.620
TRAVIS: The head of the whole thing?

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.630
SAM: It was that big?

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:49.930
MARISHA: Mister Fancypants?

00:54:53.085 --> 00:54:55.435
LAURA: Wait, isn't that where you want to go,
Fjord?

00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:03.120
TRAVIS: I mean, I did. That's the center of magical
teaching in the Empire, as I understood it.

00:55:03.282 --> 00:55:05.983
LAURA: It's really bad or something?

00:55:10.803 --> 00:55:20.241
LIAM: There's good teachers there. It's everything
that they describe it to be, but after going there

00:55:20.241 --> 00:55:33.202
for several months, one of the Assembly, who also
would teach on occasion, started interviewing me,

00:55:33.202 --> 00:55:46.524
calling me in and asking me a lot of questions. He
put me in advanced class, me and a few others.

00:55:50.607 --> 00:55:59.670
I don't want you all to be seen with me, because
if you are seen with me by one of them,

00:56:02.943 --> 00:56:07.505
they will use you to get to me.

00:56:13.114 --> 00:56:18.706
SAM: I mean, I don't want them to see me either
because they'll kill me and everyone I'm with,

00:56:18.706 --> 00:56:23.294
anyone in town, so I think we'll be hiding for
some time.

00:56:26.046 --> 00:56:33.602
LIAM: You met the man who trained me.
His name is Trent Ikithon.

00:56:34.033 --> 00:56:42.529
LAURA: That's why you always make that face.
I'm sorry, Caleb.

00:56:44.718 --> 00:56:46.913
LIAM: I'm not a very good person.

00:56:48.033 --> 00:56:56.479
LAURA: Well, I don't think our actions define who
we are all the time. Good people do bad things

00:56:56.479 --> 00:57:05.160
sometimes. Even bad people do good things.
I think you're a good person.

00:57:06.571 --> 00:57:11.214
MARISHA: For the record, Nott, I don't think it's
us that's been rubbing off on you. I think it's

00:57:11.215 --> 00:57:13.298
you that's been rubbing off on us.

00:57:18.663 --> 00:57:23.060
TRAVIS: Also, I don't think a very bad person
would care about us.

00:57:23.841 --> 00:57:27.223
LAURA: I don't think a very bad person would care
that he was very bad.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:37.309
MARISHA: Do you care about us? You've told us
several times how you've been using us.

00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:39.297
LAURA: Are you secretly in love with me?

00:57:39.601 --> 00:57:46.198
(laughter)

00:57:50.868 --> 00:57:59.087
LIAM: I'm worried about your husband. I know
the things that they can do.

00:57:59.087 --> 00:58:01.981
And I start to unwrap one of my arms.

00:58:02.473 --> 00:58:03.228
SAM: Arms?

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:04.290
LAURA: Like the skin?

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:12.344
LIAM: No, I have been wearing bandages
on my arm, and there are little, very faint

00:58:12.344 --> 00:58:14.025
scars all up the arm.

00:58:14.085 --> 00:58:15.601
SAM: Cuts? Or burns?

00:58:15.611 --> 00:58:17.881
LIAM: They are scars, faint scars, from cuts.

00:58:18.055 --> 00:58:19.127
SAM: From cuts.

00:58:20.467 --> 00:58:32.696
LIAM: He used to put crystals in-- he experimented
on us, on the three of us.

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:38.450
SAM: What would they do? Crystals?

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:43.171
LIAM: He was trying to strengthen us.

00:58:43.767 --> 00:58:44.783
MARISHA: The dunamis?

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:55.603
LIAM: No. The first time I had ever seen that
word was in your libraries, just haphazardly

00:58:55.603 --> 00:59:07.506
scrawled into a book, no explanation. No,
everything was for Empire. We were being trained

00:59:07.506 --> 00:59:24.712
to serve our Empire, above all else. He was a
little mad, himself. That is-- he was mad.

00:59:28.297 --> 00:59:33.880
MARISHA: I'm curious as to how much was for the
Empire and how much the Empire was a veil for his

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.115
own personal exploits.

00:59:36.776 --> 00:59:48.190
LIAM: He believed that the unwashed masses relied
on their base instincts and the highest calling

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:54.538
was to rise above the muck and control the cattle
for the good of all.

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:57.641
LAURA: That sounds like a bad person.

01:00:00.554 --> 01:00:14.182
LIAM: But we were-- are-- at war. Many of us
felt that way-- feel that way.

01:00:17.188 --> 01:00:19.179
SAM: Do you still feel that way?

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:25.128
LIAM: I don't believe in anything now.

01:00:27.509 --> 01:00:32.556
TRAVIS: This Trent, does he know these two
that we saw?

01:00:33.477 --> 01:00:50.852
LIAM: Yes. I don't want one more thing on my head,
to have you guys-- it's probably too late, anyway.

01:00:52.718 --> 01:00:57.134
TRAVIS: How powerful are these two? Our normal
tricks, would they fall short?

01:00:59.955 --> 01:01:13.094
LIAM: The Cerberus Assembly are the most powerful
mages in the Empire. Over two centuries ago, a

01:01:13.094 --> 01:01:24.649
number of mages went to war in the streets of
Rexxentrum. It was bloody and awful, and

01:01:24.649 --> 01:01:35.375
eventually they came to a truce and banded
together and proposed to the king at the time

01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:42.045
that they serve as an advising body
alongside the throne.

01:01:44.925 --> 01:01:53.183
LAURA: Would they see if we were disguised, or would
they have to look for us? Do you know what I mean?

01:01:53.885 --> 01:01:58.933
LIAM: I don't know for sure, but there is a reason
why I did not use anything like that back there.

01:01:58.933 --> 01:01:59.713
LAURA: Okay.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:08.162
TRAVIS: So we need to give them a very wide berth.
At the same time, we need to figure out where--

01:02:08.882 --> 01:02:17.350
SAM: Why would they have taken my husband? He was
not a magic person. He was just a chemist.

01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:20.992
LIAM: I don't know. It is something to do
with the thing.

01:02:21.212 --> 01:02:22.572
LAURA: It says it.

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:26.480
LIAM: But I don't know why him.

01:02:28.343 --> 01:02:31.020
LAURA: It says, "His instincts are solid."

01:02:31.431 --> 01:02:32.872
SAM: What instincts?

01:02:33.022 --> 01:02:37.267
LAURA: Yeza, I'm assuming. "While I find this
alchemist obnoxious in his simplicity--"

01:02:37.267 --> 01:02:39.028
I'm sorry, I don't believe that.

01:02:39.028 --> 01:02:40.067
SAM: I don't either.

01:02:40.218 --> 01:02:42.937
LAURA: "The Academy's eye for talent proves
itself again."

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:45.466
LIAM: Was he gifted? In his work?

01:02:45.948 --> 01:02:55.797
SAM: He was very brilliant in his work, but I
never saw him do any magicky things.

01:02:55.929 --> 01:02:57.168
TRAVIS: Did he experiment?

01:02:57.168 --> 01:03:03.299
LAURA: It says they want him to produce a number
of batches of that liquid, the one that we stole?

01:03:03.527 --> 01:03:11.367
LIAM: That is what is written about there, it
talks about-- Listen, I don't pretend to know what

01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:14.417
we're talking about, but it does not seem like
anything that I ever studied.

01:03:14.949 --> 01:03:19.402
SAM: He was good at what he did. He could
refine anything.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:27.156
LAURA: They wouldn't kill him then. They need him
to make batches over the next 12 to 16 months.

01:03:28.199 --> 01:03:33.306
TRAVIS: I'm sure he's alive, but if he was good at
breaking things down, taking them apart,

01:03:33.306 --> 01:03:38.736
experimenting on things, this thing that we have
falls directly into that.

01:03:39.852 --> 01:03:50.787
LIAM: It says they were looking for a way to
achieve their ends without the object. I don't

01:03:50.787 --> 01:03:56.410
know what they need. I hope he is alive, I truly
do. They will make his life very painful, though.

01:03:57.471 --> 01:04:05.832
MARISHA: Trent Ikithon was looking at Yasha. He
was side-eyeing Yasha.

01:04:05.951 --> 01:04:07.144
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.481
LAURA: Well, she's really hot.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:17.559
MARISHA: I feel like I've heard these words
before, when we were in that bar. He looks for

01:04:17.559 --> 01:04:21.065
prodigies, people with innate talent. I don't
think it matters--

01:04:24.478 --> 01:04:31.613
SAM: If they took my husband, where would they
have taken him? Their headquarters are in

01:04:31.613 --> 01:04:32.555
Rexxentrum?

01:04:32.642 --> 01:04:33.560
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;.

01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:35.569
SAM: At a school, at a--?

01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:36.953
LIAM: The city of Rexxentrum.

01:04:36.953 --> 01:04:38.992
SAM: The whole city is their headquarters?

01:04:38.992 --> 01:04:40.397
LIAM: They're based there.

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:46.268
MARISHA: The Cerberus Assembly actually has a
pretty heavy hold on Rexxentrum.

01:04:47.687 --> 01:05:00.525
LIAM: And the Empire. They are close to as
powerful-- arguably more powerful than the King.

01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:06.946
LAURA: I wonder if maybe we can break
him out before he gets there? Maybe he--

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:08.486
it only just happened.

01:05:11.328 --> 01:05:13.582
SAM: Do they have magical means of transport?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.287
LIAM: We watched Lunidus Da'leth appear
200 feet in front of us.

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:22.113
SAM: So he could already be there.

01:05:23.541 --> 01:05:25.031
LIAM: Maybe.

01:05:25.231 --> 01:05:27.517
MARISHA: I'd be willing to lay money on it.

01:05:33.239 --> 01:05:37.541
SAM: When did you get your new name?

01:05:41.679 --> 01:05:48.481
LIAM: I used a lot of names. Caleb is just what I
told you.

01:05:50.963 --> 01:05:52.542
TRAVIS: What do you prefer?

01:05:58.219 --> 01:06:03.122
LIAM: I don't know. Caleb; let's stick
with Caleb for now.

01:06:06.169 --> 01:06:21.778
SAM: Well...shit. It seems like if we are going to
chase down my husband, you're going to

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:26.048
have to go into danger. Too much danger.

01:06:30.527 --> 01:06:39.648
LIAM: (stuttering) I honestly don't know if we
can-- if we are up to this. Unless they're

01:06:39.648 --> 01:06:48.647
en route on land, maybe, but... that's
all the might of the Empire.

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:55.147
LAURA: Are we going to have to scout out and
listen in on people's conversations, see if we can--?

01:06:55.148 --> 01:07:03.975
TRAVIS: We should ask to see if anyone saw a
carriage, anything, leaving town with Yeza.

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:12.134
LAURA: Maybe if we go with our insurance company
scheme, we can say that we believe there's been

01:07:12.134 --> 01:07:14.264
fraud and he's not really dead or something.

01:07:15.036 --> 01:07:15.736
SAM: And--

01:07:15.736 --> 01:07:16.438
MARISHA: Nott.

01:07:16.438 --> 01:07:17.145
SAM: Yes?

01:07:17.145 --> 01:07:19.432
MARISHA: Sorry, you were going to say something.

01:07:19.432 --> 01:07:21.096
SAM: No, I just had more questions.

01:07:21.096 --> 01:07:25.281
MARISHA: All right, I was going to ask you a
question. I don't think you know the answer,

01:07:25.281 --> 01:07:30.458
MARISHA: though. Your son mentioned that a
mean lady with pointy ears keeps coming by.

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:34.149
SAM: Was that one of these people that we saw?

01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:35.002
LAURA: Lady--

01:07:35.002 --> 01:07:37.311
SAM: They had pointy ears. They're elves, right?

01:07:37.311 --> 01:07:38.501
LIAM: They're both elves.

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:40.807
SAM: Then what? One of them look mean?

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:46.549
MARISHA: Well, if he's talking about Vess DeRogna--

01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:55.883
SAM: Is that someone who would have-- do you know
her to be someone who would be-- someone who could

01:07:55.883 --> 01:07:57.919
harness chemicals and--?

01:07:58.171 --> 01:08:03.964
LIAM: Vess DeRogna-- I'm sorry, no. Vess DeRogna is
the Archmage of Antiquities. She is half a recluse.

01:08:03.964 --> 01:08:08.969
She taught at the school-- not me, or
years above me.

01:08:09.528 --> 01:08:11.913
TRAVIS and LAURA: What does that mean,
antiquities?

01:08:11.914 --> 01:08:14.961
SAM: Would she be interested in the things that
Yeza was helping?

01:08:14.967 --> 01:08:25.432
LIAM: She's a historian. She knows-- she has
uncovered mysteries of the past, they would say at

01:08:25.432 --> 01:08:30.800
school. She's a history buff and
awful as well, probably.

01:08:31.076 --> 01:08:35.647
SAM: Could she be the one who is visiting
my home?

01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:43.087
MARISHA: It sounds like they've been here watching
your husband for quite some time, which means

01:08:43.087 --> 01:08:44.895
checking in on your son.

01:08:45.604 --> 01:08:53.363
LIAM: Da'leth is Domestic Protection. He is the
head of the military. If they are both here,

01:08:53.363 --> 01:09:01.625
I would imagine that he is here overseeing all of
the Red Brands we saw and she is probably here

01:09:01.625 --> 01:09:05.660
trying to figure out what's in that bag.

01:09:08.594 --> 01:09:17.734
SAM: Then, do we have-- because I don't know how
this all connects. Do we know why the cricks also

01:09:17.734 --> 01:09:28.647
attacked? Did they sense a disturbance in their
juice or whatever that stuff is? The dunamis?

01:09:29.145 --> 01:09:33.165
LAURA: Do you think maybe they're attacking
because we have the thingy?

01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:37.886
SAM: We've had the thingy for a long time. It
doesn't explain why they would attack here, now.

01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:38.675
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:09:38.746 --> 01:09:42.274
LIAM: They could be combing the Empire for it.

01:09:43.496 --> 01:09:45.258
TRAVIS: It might not be the only one.

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:47.996
LAURA: Okay.

01:09:48.876 --> 01:09:55.178
MARISHA: It feels like-- it is a piece of dunamis,
right?

01:09:55.284 --> 01:09:57.523
MATT: Caleb, roll an intelligence check for me.

01:09:57.524 --> 01:09:58.437
LIAM: Thank you.

01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:03.373
LAURA: Be smart. Be so smart.

01:10:03.535 --> 01:10:04.282
LIAM: 19.

01:10:04.463 --> 01:10:05.615
TRAVIS: Pretty smart.

01:10:06.115 --> 01:10:09.995
MATT: On the notes, where it mentions beacons--

01:10:09.995 --> 01:10:11.829
LAURA: It says there's other beacons.

01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:13.112
LIAM: More than one, yeah.

01:10:13.113 --> 01:10:16.850
MARISHA: Yeah, and this thing that we had was
called "the beacon." Right, okay.

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:18.665
LAURA: Okay, so there's more than one.

01:10:18.665 --> 01:10:28.403
LIAM: We saw an attack on the tower in Zadash.
That was ages ago at this point. And now they're

01:10:28.403 --> 01:10:29.814
well into the Empire.

01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:34.505
LAURA: "As we continue to invoke the beacon--"
That means they have one.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:35.866
SAM: Or had one.

01:10:36.045 --> 01:10:40.462
LAURA: Right. "--with extremely focused energy of
different spectrums and sources, divine and

01:10:40.462 --> 01:10:46.916
"arcane, the effects unleashed are ever curious and
reach far beyond this laboratory. The dunamis

01:10:46.916 --> 01:10:54.323
"field often sightlessly encompassed an entire
portion of the town, with locals complaining of an

01:10:54.323 --> 01:10:58.469
"ill sluggish sensation akin to being dragged
down." So--

01:10:58.469 --> 01:11:00.933
SAM: So they had one of our dodecahedrons here.

01:11:00.933 --> 01:11:05.544
LAURA: Oh my god, what if you put the dodecahedron
on the tripod thing that we got, right? Then we

01:11:05.544 --> 01:11:12.465
hit it with some sort of spell. I wonder if it
would amplify that spell, you know what I mean?

01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:17.274
TRAVIS: And also ring the dinner bell, Jester. I
think that's the more dangerous part. We're super

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:22.462
close to the front line, or at least to them. You
do that, we might get exactly what we're asking

01:11:22.462 --> 01:11:24.936
for, but then trouble might also come calling.

01:11:25.268 --> 01:11:26.288
LAURA: That's true.

01:11:26.626 --> 01:11:37.465
MARISHA: The people that we saw fighting, having
the DC fight in the air, full on anime battle--

01:11:37.465 --> 01:11:44.198
did we recognize the-- because I know they were
wizards that were fighting the crick assassins

01:11:44.198 --> 01:11:45.216
that were coming in.

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:46.977
MATT: It seemed to be the case, yes.

01:11:47.207 --> 01:11:54.738
MARISHA: Do we recognise the clothing and
appearance of the Archmage and Lady Vess?

01:11:54.738 --> 01:11:56.248
Is it the same people?

01:11:56.248 --> 01:12:00.682
MATT: No. Not the people that are currently with
you now, no. The people that are in the city.

01:12:00.739 --> 01:12:02.268
MARISHA: But the same robes?

01:12:02.646 --> 01:12:08.460
MATT: There isn't a uniform robe. There is no--
and you would know this, too. Even mages in a

01:12:08.461 --> 01:12:12.920
union aren't like, "Let's all wear similar
uniforms." They all very much see themselves as

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.620
individuals in a circle.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.479
LIAM: What about the annexes?

01:12:18.081 --> 01:12:19.130
MATT: Hmm?

01:12:19.398 --> 01:12:24.462
LIAM: The annexes? People who-- it was in the lore
that you shared with me.

01:12:24.521 --> 01:12:30.990
MATT: Oh right, yeah. No. For students and
everything there would be uniforms, but as far as

01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:38.191
members of the Assembly proper, there's no
consistent uniform amongst members of the

01:12:38.191 --> 01:12:49.670
Assembly. As is the nature when you get to a
certain level of arcane capabilities, even working

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:56.465
with other mages, there's a general, for the most
part, an idea of "Well, I'm still better than them."

01:12:57.504 --> 01:13:08.143
LIAM: These papers conjecture that in Ghor Dranas
they are able to control fate and time. Clearly it

01:13:08.143 --> 01:13:17.106
was stolen from them and brought here, so it could
be the source of their presence here.

01:13:19.626 --> 01:13:25.835
MARISHA: Caleb, you were in the library of the
Cobalt Soul when you stumbled upon dunamis for the

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:27.545
for the first time.

01:13:27.605 --> 01:13:36.196
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, it was a note scrawled to the side of
a book. It said that the Cerberus Assembly was

01:13:36.196 --> 01:13:41.507
looking into some sort of new arcane study and the
word "dunamis" was written. That was it.

01:13:41.595 --> 01:13:47.766
MARISHA: What were you looking for when you found
it? What were you trying to find?

01:13:50.098 --> 01:14:10.317
LIAM: I was studying history, and-- I need to
become more powerful if I want to do anything.

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:18.295
MARISHA: You still haven't answered my previous
question of how you were using us and what that

01:14:18.295 --> 01:14:19.393
means to you.

01:14:21.994 --> 01:14:33.326
LIAM: Look at me. I am a string bean, I am weak as
it comes. I am weak. Look at that. Look at her.

01:14:34.363 --> 01:14:35.564
LAURA: Look at me.

01:14:36.202 --> 01:14:38.180
MARISHA: Her guns are bigger than mine.

01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:44.169
LIAM: You have no guns. That was an exaggeration
that day. You are just fast and quick and talented.

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:49.369
MARISHA: Okay. Was that a compliment?

01:14:49.369 --> 01:14:50.308
TRAVIS: I think so.

01:14:50.309 --> 01:14:51.132
MARISHA: Okay.

01:14:51.132 --> 01:14:53.080
TRAVIS: It's kind of like when you smile.

01:14:53.081 --> 01:14:56.986
SAM: I feel like there's a difference between
using someone and relying on someone.

01:14:56.986 --> 01:15:01.367
MARISHA: That's what I was going to say. Do you
think that Fjord was using us? You think that

01:15:01.368 --> 01:15:02.838
Nott's been using us?

01:15:03.007 --> 01:15:04.888
TALIESIN: (whispering) Shut up, Travis.

01:15:05.969 --> 01:15:11.755
MARISHA: You know, we're also here volunteering
our help.

01:15:11.755 --> 01:15:15.905
LAURA: It's only using us if you don't like us. Do
you like us, though?

01:15:20.506 --> 01:15:21.355
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja.&lt;/i&gt;

01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:22.154
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;Ja!&lt;/i&gt;

01:15:23.194 --> 01:15:24.195
SAM: You do?

01:15:30.071 --> 01:15:42.782
LIAM: (sighs) I... Oh, Jester. I am glad you see
good in me.

01:15:45.362 --> 01:15:52.902
MARISHA: Caleb, you were right when you said
earlier that it's too late now. That we're involved.

01:15:54.692 --> 01:16:00.471
But I don't think we see it in the same
way that you do. It's too late now because,

01:16:00.471 --> 01:16:05.213
whether you like it or not, we all care about you
and are invested in, you know, your happiness,

01:16:05.213 --> 01:16:09.291
I guess? So...

01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:17.463
LIAM: Okay.

01:16:21.371 --> 01:16:32.702
MARISHA: Don't run. You can say you don't believe
in anything, and that's fine. Believe in us,

01:16:32.702 --> 01:16:34.020
just a little bit?

01:16:43.503 --> 01:16:46.585
LIAM: I will consider it heavily.

01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:57.674
MARISHA: I'm sorry for not hearing you yesterday.
Honestly, you saying that you don't believe in

01:16:57.674 --> 01:17:05.616
anything kind of put everything into perspective
about that conversation. I heard that you were

01:17:05.616 --> 01:17:08.468
doubting me and us, and our friendship.

01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:22.800
LIAM: I don't doubt any of you at all.
(louder) You too!

01:17:23.969 --> 01:17:26.884
TALIESIN: Uh, yeah. I'll have some if someone's
making something.

01:17:27.215 --> 01:17:32.360
(laughter)

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:34.361
SAM: He could give two shits.

01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:37.420
TRAVIS: You're going to have to do this twice.

01:17:40.101 --> 01:17:41.281
MARISHA: One last time!

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:43.327
LIAM: That one will be off-camera.

01:17:43.436 --> 01:17:45.116
TALIESIN: Very off-camera.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:18:01.584
TRAVIS: So do we avoid your two professors?
Or do we try to study them, divide them,

01:18:01.584 --> 01:18:03.086
interrogate one of them--

01:18:03.086 --> 01:18:03.989
LAURA and LIAM: No.

01:18:03.989 --> 01:18:06.178
LAURA: Fjord, they're way too powerful for us.

01:18:06.179 --> 01:18:07.516
TRAVIS: You don't know that.

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:08.222
LAURA: Fjord.

01:18:08.222 --> 01:18:13.342
TRAVIS: What? I swallow shit and make it appear
in my weapons; I'm fucking down to throw,

01:18:13.342 --> 01:18:14.531
you know what I'm saying?

01:18:14.531 --> 01:18:18.412
LAURA: You can control water, which I can do too;
I'm not that powerful.

01:18:18.412 --> 01:18:24.212
TRAVIS: You don't have to minimize my new shit,
okay? I'm real proud of it. I've had it for a

01:18:24.212 --> 01:18:25.582
fucking hot second.

01:18:25.582 --> 01:18:30.146
LAURA: I'm just saying, they've probably been
studying for a very long time. And if I'm not wrong

01:18:30.146 --> 01:18:35.027
they're elves. And elves live for a very
long time. And they look kind of old, okay?

01:18:35.028 --> 01:18:36.447
So they're probably--

01:18:36.538 --> 01:18:41.397
LIAM: The elder gentleman started the Cerberus
Assembly over 250 years ago.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:45.852
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe we don't try to separate him.
Right. Well, what about the one that studies

01:18:45.852 --> 01:18:48.729
history? You met a bunch of really dangerous
historians?

01:18:50.168 --> 01:18:53.509
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah, I have.

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.817
TRAVIS: What do I know, man? I'm a fucking
sailor.

01:19:01.698 --> 01:19:10.620
LAURA: You're pretty powerful, okay? You're really
strong. You're very handsome. You got some really

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.577
cool spells. You can make darkness appear. It's
really awesome.

01:19:14.578 --> 01:19:18.108
TRAVIS: Listen, Jester-- As much as I love this,
it's not about me, okay?

01:19:19.258 --> 01:19:23.380
TALIESIN: Hey, if you all don't stop arguing, I'm
going to turn this cart right around.

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:24.155
LAURA: Yes, sir!

01:19:24.155 --> 01:19:27.911
TALIESIN: I don't know if you were arguing, I've
just always wanted to say that.

01:19:27.912 --> 01:19:29.957
LAURA: We were. We were having a big fight.

01:19:29.957 --> 01:19:31.126
TALIESIN: Man!

01:19:31.126 --> 01:19:33.194
TRAVIS: So what do we do?

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:37.651
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading back to town
regardless; it's getting cold.

01:19:38.567 --> 01:19:41.847
TRAVIS: We need to send your son on his way.

01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.809
SAM: All right.

01:19:43.839 --> 01:19:45.568
TRAVIS: Do we need to try and--

01:19:45.569 --> 01:19:47.889
LIAM: That's a tangible goal that we can do.

01:19:48.528 --> 01:19:53.900
TRAVIS: Do we want to ask if your husband was
spotted leaving by some sort of natural means?

01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:55.269
SAM: Sure, yes.

01:19:55.972 --> 01:19:56.672
LAURA: Okay.

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.617
TRAVIS: Then we kill the two elves.

01:20:00.039 --> 01:20:04.974
LAURA: Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Maybe we go up
into their room at night or something and just,

01:20:04.975 --> 01:20:06.847
you know... Stabby stab.

01:20:06.847 --> 01:20:12.772
TRAVIS: Yeah, you seduce one, I'll seduce the
other, no problem. I have a way with elvish folk.

01:20:13.698 --> 01:20:17.603
TALIESIN: It's like you two have been reading
Tumblr. This is so-- Sorry, carry on.

01:20:19.495 --> 01:20:22.130
TRAVIS: We'll deal with one thing at a time.

01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:27.723
SAM: It would make me happy to even know that he's
alive. To get some sort confirmation that someone

01:20:27.723 --> 01:20:29.467
saw him alive or...

01:20:31.584 --> 01:20:34.215
TRAVIS: Have we talked about sending a message?

01:20:34.476 --> 01:20:37.494
LAURA: (gasp) Maybe I can send a message to him!

01:20:37.494 --> 01:20:41.686
TRAVIS: I mean, if he's in Super Magical
Headquarters, I'm sure there might be protection

01:20:41.686 --> 01:20:42.714
against that, but--

01:20:42.754 --> 01:20:44.865
SAM: Is that a bad idea? That's a bad idea.

01:20:44.865 --> 01:20:48.574
TALIESIN: Wait, what? You trying to find out if
someone's alive?

01:20:48.726 --> 01:20:49.458
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:20:50.265 --> 01:20:51.519
TALIESIN: I can do that.

01:20:51.684 --> 01:20:52.463
TRAVIS: Oh--

01:20:52.463 --> 01:20:53.212
SAM: How?

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:58.263
TRAVIS: Yeah! Your Wildmother-- the thing you did
for me!

01:20:58.264 --> 01:20:59.835
MARISHA: Caduceus is a wild mom?

01:20:59.835 --> 01:21:01.444
TRAVIS: No. Nope. No, he has--

01:21:01.444 --> 01:21:05.195
LAURA: He's such a wild mom; he's partying
all the time!

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.450
MARISHA: So many wine spritzers.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.892
SAM: Moms gone wild?

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:14.766
TALIESIN: Moms gone wild. What? Hmm?

01:21:14.887 --> 01:21:17.205
SAM: What is the process by which you would...

01:21:17.733 --> 01:21:24.450
TALIESIN: I would just-- I have a little ritual in
the morning, meditate on it, see if I can feel

01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:29.072
anything tugging in some direction; and I couldn't
know much, but I could know something.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:33.721
SAM: Well do you think, Caleb, that they would
sense that? Is that a magical force?

01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:34.825
Is that a divine force?

01:21:34.826 --> 01:21:37.824
TALIESIN: It's a divine force, but I don't
think that it would--

01:21:37.824 --> 01:21:41.059
LAURA: Do you have to do it in the morning or can
you do it at night?

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:43.437
TALIESIN: Well I mean, I'd have to sleep.

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:45.734
LAURA: Oh; I understand.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:49.638
LIAM: It all depends on how he reacts if Caduceus
is able to contact him.

01:21:49.986 --> 01:21:59.659
TALIESIN: I couldn't know much. But I could maybe,
at the very least, give you a yes/no. Maybe.

01:21:59.659 --> 01:22:02.884
SAM: That would make me very happy.

01:22:05.831 --> 01:22:08.101
LAURA: So we head to the inn.

01:22:08.408 --> 01:22:09.117
SAM: Okay.

01:22:09.526 --> 01:22:12.871
LAIRA: We don't talk about anything when we're in
the town, right?

01:22:13.109 --> 01:22:15.612
SAM: Except someone has to ask about--

01:22:15.993 --> 01:22:19.048
TRAVIS: We can do that. Cover of night. Helps.

01:22:19.048 --> 01:22:25.282
TALIESIN: Well I'm happy we're coming to town to
talk to this famous alchemist and this has really

01:22:25.282 --> 01:22:29.764
thrown something into our plans. I don't know
what-- Do people throw monkeys into plans?

01:22:29.764 --> 01:22:30.974
What do people throw?

01:22:30.974 --> 01:22:31.771
MARISHA: Close.

01:22:31.771 --> 01:22:32.686
SAM: It's a wrench.

01:22:32.744 --> 01:22:35.760
TALIESIN: A wrench? Yeah, this has wrenched
our monkey.

01:22:35.793 --> 01:22:42.973
LIAM: A couple of us tonight-- not me, but a
couple of us could check the town out, and ask

01:22:42.974 --> 01:22:47.676
some questions, and ask if many people were taken
away or not.

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:49.525
LAURA and SAM: Yeah.

01:22:49.654 --> 01:22:52.752
TALIESIN: Hmm, not a bad idea.

01:22:52.752 --> 01:22:53.768
TRAVIS: To the inn?

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:55.627
TALIESIN: I'm already heading that way.

01:22:55.627 --> 01:23:00.107
LAURA: I'm going to take everything that we've
been looking at and stick in the bag so it can't

01:23:00.107 --> 01:23:01.399
be scried on or something.

01:23:01.399 --> 01:23:15.877
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way towards
Felderwin proper. Through this conversation, the

01:23:15.877 --> 01:23:20.277
majority of the Righteous Brand has moved on,
heading northeast towards the front lines.

01:23:22.348 --> 01:23:28.496
Crownsguard are still present and there still is,
definitely amongst those that are here-- and Nott,

01:23:28.496 --> 01:23:34.718
you can say that there are more crownsguard
present here than there usually are. Probably just

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:41.637
to keep an eye now that the military has moved on.
You make your way towards the center of the city,

01:23:41.637 --> 01:23:48.826
leading them towards the Goldfield Tavern and
Lodge. Heading inside, it's fairly empty. You

01:23:48.826 --> 01:23:55.738
place the cart outside for the time being. Towards
the bar on the far end, you see the familiar face

01:23:55.738 --> 01:24:03.227
of Simone Deepwell. He's the halfling, the
barkeep, and owner. Dark brown skin; short,

01:24:03.227 --> 01:24:08.487
gray-white hair. Very cheerful demeanor, he seems
to be excited at the prospect that folks are

01:24:08.487 --> 01:24:13.196
stopping in with all the chaos that's happened as
he leans over the front of the counter and goes--

01:24:13.196 --> 01:24:15.608
SAM: I'm going to look like just a gnome.

01:24:15.608 --> 01:24:18.666
MATT: Okay. Just a gnome. The rest of you keeping
it as is?

01:24:19.566 --> 01:24:21.737
LIAM: Hood up and I'm still dirty as sin.

01:24:21.738 --> 01:24:28.227
TALIESIN: I think I've still got a little bit of time
on my shaggy redhead. Wait, no. Am I out now?

01:24:28.227 --> 01:24:32.415
MATT: Most of the illusions you had in the city
have faded at this time since you've been

01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:33.745
traversing the exterior.

01:24:34.253 --> 01:24:35.637
TRAVIS: I'm going &lt;i&gt;au natural.&lt;/i&gt;

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:36.746
LAURA: Yeah, same.

01:24:36.746 --> 01:24:39.538
MARISHA: I'm going to button up and go
full Cobalt colors.

01:24:39.688 --> 01:24:47.137
MATT: You got it. Anyway, Simone leans forward and
goes, "Why hello there! What can I do for you?

01:24:47.137 --> 01:24:48.599
"You looking for rooms for the night?"

01:24:48.799 --> 01:24:49.658
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:24:49.858 --> 01:24:52.968
MATT: "How many is that? Book a room each?"

01:24:52.968 --> 01:24:56.038
TRAVIS: Four rooms? Three?

01:24:56.478 --> 01:24:58.787
LAURA: Three rooms, I think, should do it.

01:24:59.329 --> 01:25:00.297
MATT: "How many?"

01:25:00.297 --> 01:25:00.996
LAURA: Three.

01:25:00.997 --> 01:25:06.618
MATT: "Three? Three rooms, all right. Well, we got
plenty of space with events being as they have

01:25:06.618 --> 01:25:13.458
"been. That'll put you back about, let's say one
gold, one silver for the three?"

01:25:14.011 --> 01:25:16.815
LAURA: That sounds like a very good deal. Thank
you so much.

01:25:16.815 --> 01:25:18.249
MATT: "All right, no worries."

01:25:18.249 --> 01:25:19.629
LAURA: Yeah, I'll pay for it.

01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:24.421
MATT: Fumbles through some keys and passes them
out to you. "Feel free to distribute as need be.

01:25:25.148 --> 01:25:26.838
"If you need anything, let me know."

01:25:26.838 --> 01:25:33.599
TRAVIS: You said with events being as they have
been. We noticed there's been a ruckus recently.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:39.810
MATT: "Yeah, you could say that. You could say
that. I mean, 'ruckus' is a word."

01:25:40.014 --> 01:25:45.843
TRAVIS: Calm the last few days? Any reason why we
should be apprehensive this evening?

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:53.711
MATT: "I certainly hope not. We've kind of seen
kind of the craziest thing Felderwin's ever seen

01:25:53.711 --> 01:26:03.354
"in most of its history since war with the
Dominion. So I sincerely hope not. I mean, it's

01:26:03.354 --> 01:26:11.378
"one less competitive inn, but poor Jer. I just
feel bad for everyone that lost their homes and

01:26:11.378 --> 01:26:14.566
"businesses in that affair. It's not good."

01:26:15.355 --> 01:26:21.366
TRAVIS: I understand. The aftermath, we saw troops
leaving on our way in.

01:26:21.405 --> 01:26:27.375
MATT: "Yeah, they've been here a few weeks just
walking around. Just in case they came back."

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.501
TRAVIS: They catch any of those that were guilty
of all this?

01:26:32.147 --> 01:26:38.617
MATT: "No. They came in without warning. Just tore
through, burned things and left."

01:26:39.756 --> 01:26:44.972
LAURA: We were hoping to buy some potions while we
were here. Do you know if there's a good alchemy

01:26:44.972 --> 01:26:46.739
shop or anything around?

01:26:47.785 --> 01:26:54.021
MATT: "Yeah, see, the only real alchemist around
here was one of the homesteads that

01:26:54.021 --> 01:26:55.695
"burned down, unfortunately."

01:26:55.695 --> 01:26:56.739
LAURA: Oh no.

01:26:57.419 --> 01:27:02.675
MATT: "But there's the Crossroads not too far from
here; big trading post in the middle of the

01:27:02.675 --> 01:27:08.441
"Marrow Valley." Which you've been to before.
"That's probably your best bet."

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:12.372
LAURA: Do you know? The alchemy shop, what was the
name of it?

01:27:13.152 --> 01:27:15.702
MATT: "Oh, that was the Brenatto Apothecary."

01:27:15.702 --> 01:27:19.403
LAURA: Brenatto Apo-- Do you know if this Brenatto
is around, still?

01:27:19.773 --> 01:27:25.065
MATT: "Last I heard, Brenatto went missing. Could
probably ask the crownsguard. I don't think

01:27:25.065 --> 01:27:27.709
"they've updated anything. But--"

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:28.479
LAURA: Okay.

01:27:28.479 --> 01:27:35.938
MATT: "Most of the folks here got killed in the
fire, so might best ask them."

01:27:35.938 --> 01:27:40.911
TALIESIN: Crownsguard is probably our best bet if
some of the people we're looking for happen to be

01:27:40.911 --> 01:27:43.129
still missing in the aftermath, then?

01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:44.313
MATT: "I can imagine."

01:27:44.313 --> 01:27:45.267
TALIESIN: All right.

01:27:45.747 --> 01:27:46.453
LAURA: Great.

01:27:46.453 --> 01:27:47.812
TRAVIS: Appreciate ya.

01:27:48.402 --> 01:27:55.587
MATT: "No worries. We have two meals here: one
shortly after dusk; and bright and early in the

01:27:55.587 --> 01:28:00.320
"morning, right after sunup. You got about an hour
window. If you miss it, well, there's plenty of--

01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:04.719
"Should be plenty of food amongst the city to find,
so good luck."

01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:07.830
LAURA: Did we miss the meal already today, then?

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:13.340
MATT: "Nah, you've still got a few hours before
sundown, so just come on by and go ahead

01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.930
"and get me and my wife cooking."

01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:24.562
TALIESIN: This is going to sound weird, but is
there a florist around? Or anybody who deals with

01:28:24.562 --> 01:28:27.776
exotics? Exotic herbs, plants, or otherwise.

01:28:28.201 --> 01:28:33.561
MATT: "You mean herbs and spices? Yeah. I mean,
there's Felderwin General has all manner of

01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:36.134
"various flavorings if that's what you're looking for."

01:28:36.135 --> 01:28:37.712
TALIESIN: Something exciting.

01:28:37.933 --> 01:28:45.643
MATT: "Yeah. Felderwin's not known for its
excitement, necessarily. But keep your eye out.

01:28:45.699 --> 01:28:50.232
"Who knows what you'll find with the right
questions, I don't know. I've seen some wild folk

01:28:50.232 --> 01:28:56.480
"come in these doors in my days, I'll tell you
that much. Not all as colorful as you, though.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:01.705
"So can't say my experiences are a good basis
of comparison, if you catch my drift."

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:06.108
TALIESIN: I'm looking forward to a little quiet.

01:29:06.434 --> 01:29:11.211
MATT: "You and me both. Now all them soldiers are
out of here at least. I'm going to miss the

01:29:11.211 --> 01:29:15.917
"coinage, but I ain't going to miss the riff-raff."

01:29:18.133 --> 01:29:19.077
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:29:19.392 --> 01:29:22.433
MATT: "Yeah, no worries. I'll see you around
dinner time, then."

01:29:22.477 --> 01:29:23.389
LAURA: All right.

01:29:23.821 --> 01:29:25.759
TRAVIS: Ducey. A florist?

01:29:26.364 --> 01:29:37.366
TALIESIN: I need something. It's nice to have
something complicated to use to focus myself.

01:29:38.069 --> 01:29:40.187
MARISHA: Complicated? Is that what you said?

01:29:40.187 --> 01:29:40.821
TALIESIN: Mm.

01:29:40.944 --> 01:29:42.480
LAURA: (puffing)

01:29:43.173 --> 01:29:44.635
TALIESIN: Not quite, but yeah.

01:29:44.935 --> 01:29:48.172
LAURA: Oh, really? I was joking.

01:29:48.242 --> 01:29:49.416
SAM: Like tea?

01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:51.657
MARISHA: Poppy seeds?

01:29:51.657 --> 01:29:57.006
TALIESIN: Anything. Preferably some sort of flower
or living plant but if it's--

01:29:57.006 --> 01:30:00.362
MARISHA: Chamomile? Black-eyed Susans?

01:30:00.362 --> 01:30:01.295
TRAVIS: Stop.

01:30:03.555 --> 01:30:13.411
TALIESIN: The notion is, I'm looking for something
that is a testament to the abilities of the

01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:20.845
Wildmother, so anything that is a gift from her to
us. Something impressive, something beautiful,

01:30:20.845 --> 01:30:22.035
something tasty.

01:30:22.368 --> 01:30:23.155
LAURA: Honey!

01:30:23.796 --> 01:30:27.947
TALIESIN: I've never tried honey. I don't know if
it would work, but that's interesting.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:33.589
MARISHA: I mean, it's essence of flower and bee
puke. It's a miracle.

01:30:33.589 --> 01:30:38.126
TALIESIN: I usually tend to stick a little closer
to the source. I also don't really necessarily

01:30:38.127 --> 01:30:40.365
know how I would perform the ritual with honey.

01:30:40.365 --> 01:30:42.996
LIAM: I have a decent amount of molasses,
if you like.

01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:46.906
TALIESIN: I honestly don't know the difference
between molasses and honey.

01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:50.677
LIAM: Well, one is the bee poop; but molasses
comes out of a tree.

01:30:50.921 --> 01:30:52.490
TALIESIN: Tree poop and bee poop.

01:30:53.499 --> 01:30:55.817
MARISHA: Well, it's more of a-- it's fine.

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:57.038
TRAVIS: Let it ride.

01:30:57.097 --> 01:30:58.396
SAM: I have some tobacco.

01:30:58.405 --> 01:31:02.478
TALIESIN: That might be interesting, but I
think I should probably see if there's

01:31:02.479 --> 01:31:03.798
anything around, possibly.

01:31:04.619 --> 01:31:07.858
MARISHA: I have this red feather from Nila.
She was also a firbolg.

01:31:07.887 --> 01:31:11.557
TALIESIN: I'm not sure how that relates, but
that is a very beautiful feather.

01:31:11.615 --> 01:31:14.121
MARISHA: Well. Yeah, that's fair.

01:31:16.701 --> 01:31:21.496
MATT: If you'd like to, make an investigation
check to wander about the town to see if

01:31:21.496 --> 01:31:23.671
you can manage to muster some supplies.

01:31:23.671 --> 01:31:26.230
SAM: I can give him some advice on
places to look.

01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:29.183
MATT: Actually, you would-- yeah. Take some
advantage on that.

01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:35.341
TALIESIN: Do you want to roll? Okay, no. I'll roll
it because my investigation is amazing.

01:31:35.341 --> 01:31:41.671
Here we go. Come on. Ah! That's a natural 20.
That brings me to a-- that's a 19, then.

01:31:47.601 --> 01:31:52.867
MATT: Felderwin would be one of the few places in
the empire where the Wildmother would be very

01:31:52.868 --> 01:32:02.999
popular if she weren't outlawed, and you get the
sense that there might even be an unspoken worship

01:32:02.999 --> 01:32:06.081
to her amongst this very rural farming community.

01:32:06.409 --> 01:32:10.335
TALIESIN: I'm hoping to find an orchid or
something. Something interesting.

01:32:11.408 --> 01:32:21.266
MATT: You manage to go to both Felderwin General
and, with Nott's help, sneak into one of the

01:32:21.266 --> 01:32:30.362
elaborate specialty herb-growing boxes,
specifically for the purpose of various medicinal

01:32:30.363 --> 01:32:35.926
herbs. We'll say, over the period of the next 30
minutes or so, you gather what would be

01:32:35.926 --> 01:32:37.126
about 25 gold worth of--

01:32:37.126 --> 01:32:43.631
TALIESIN: It's as if you knew what I was doing.
Thank you. (laughs) Thank you, and here goes

01:32:43.631 --> 01:32:48.752
25 gold. That's all I needed to do, really.
That was my pre-game.

01:32:49.737 --> 01:32:52.559
MATT: Okay. Anyone else got anything?

01:32:55.739 --> 01:32:57.995
SAM: This is not nighttime yet, we're just--

01:32:58.068 --> 01:32:59.998
MATT: No, but you're getting closer.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:11.008
LAURA: We're keeping an eye out for any cloaked,
robed elven people. Yeah, we're trying to avoid them.

01:33:11.627 --> 01:33:23.497
MARISHA: Would Nott know of a general physician,
a doctor? Someone?

01:33:25.107 --> 01:33:28.288
SAM: I mean, we have one with us-- two with us.

01:33:28.846 --> 01:33:30.388
MARISHA: Local doctor.

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:32.088
SAM: &lt;i&gt;Local&lt;/i&gt; doctor.

01:33:32.637 --> 01:33:34.347
TRAVIS: That might know locals?

01:33:34.547 --> 01:33:38.558
SAM: Oh, someone who might have repaired one of
the soldiers or something like that?

01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:46.169
MARISHA: It said in those papers about them
being sick from the-- the town complaining

01:33:46.169 --> 01:33:47.476
about sluggishness.

01:33:47.967 --> 01:33:53.669
MATT: You do know there is a female human
physician in the town. There's a number of

01:33:53.669 --> 01:34:00.997
physicians and people, but there is one named Demi
Leric, who is the altruistic member of the

01:34:00.997 --> 01:34:09.668
community. Doesn't charge, but accepts donations
and is often the first to try and help out those

01:34:09.668 --> 01:34:14.818
of the more meager lifestyle in this
farming community.

01:34:15.506 --> 01:34:16.348
SAM: Okay.

01:34:16.908 --> 01:34:18.388
TRAVIS: Demi Leric, you say.

01:34:18.468 --> 01:34:20.666
SAM: Dr. Demi Leric, medicine woman.

01:34:21.572 --> 01:34:23.844
MATT: (laughs) More or less. Sure.

01:34:24.014 --> 01:34:26.145
LAURA: I also want to find a crownsguard.

01:34:26.408 --> 01:34:30.691
MATT: Easy enough to find as you're glancing
around because they're fairly present and

01:34:30.691 --> 01:34:36.455
conversing. You see one set of three that are
walking past. The one seems most energetic in

01:34:36.455 --> 01:34:41.662
conversation is in the process of regaling the
other two with some inane tale.

01:34:41.662 --> 01:34:45.719
Scrawny, human-looking fellow, looking like
he's mid-30s or so, chin scruff, but can't

01:34:45.719 --> 01:34:48.601
quite grow a full beard. Like me, apparently.

01:34:48.601 --> 01:34:50.790
LAURA: You have a lovely, full beard, Matthew.

01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:52.459
MATT: I'm still getting used to it.

01:34:52.459 --> 01:34:55.706
TRAVIS: (whisper) Come forth! Come forth!

01:34:55.952 --> 01:35:04.210
LAURA: (explosion) I'll split off from the group
so that I'm not drawing attention. Excuse me?

01:35:04.627 --> 01:35:07.339
MATT: "Hey. Yeah, can I help you?"

01:35:07.339 --> 01:35:15.972
LAURA: Yeah, I'm staying at the local inn right
now. I have a friend. He's losing a little bit of

01:35:15.972 --> 01:35:22.505
his hair, and he was hoping-- &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; was hoping for a
present I could get him, maybe a potion that would

01:35:22.506 --> 01:35:29.145
grow it? Do you know where I could find somebody
that could grow hair, a potion maker or something?

01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:37.878
MATT: "Can't say I'm too familiar with hair
tonics, per se."

01:35:38.393 --> 01:35:42.312
LAURA: I don't know what kind of potions can be
made. Do you know?

01:35:42.312 --> 01:35:46.736
MATT: "If you're looking for anything too fancy,
I'd probably recommend heading on to Zadash."

01:35:46.736 --> 01:35:51.159
LAURA: Okay, okay. What about alchemy? Is there a
local alchemist or something?

01:35:52.851 --> 01:35:54.517
MATT: "Not anymore, unfortunately."

01:35:54.517 --> 01:35:55.220
LAURA: No?

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:58.840
MATT: "That was one of the buildings we lost to
the cricks a few weeks back."

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:07.337
LAURA: Oh no! The building is gone; what about the
person that ran the shop?

01:36:08.227 --> 01:36:13.143
MATT: "Hell if I know. Cricks ran in here and
started killing people left and right and

01:36:14.613 --> 01:36:19.819
"left in the same hour they arrived. It was like
a swift nightmare, tearing through here."

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:28.628
LAURA: That's insane. I've never seen a crick.
What do they look like?

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:33.537
MATT: "Let me tell you, did you ever have one of
them terrible dreams where something comes out of

01:36:33.537 --> 01:36:40.396
"the darkness and tries to grab at you and cut at
you? It's burning eyes of evil and dark armor of

01:36:40.396 --> 01:36:41.706
"shadow and nothing?"

01:36:41.706 --> 01:36:42.430
LAURA: Mm-hmm?

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:46.905
MATT: "Well, imagine a bunch of them popping out
of the ground and cutting down your friends--"

01:36:46.905 --> 01:36:49.016
LAURA: How did they pop out of the ground?

01:36:49.016 --> 01:36:55.192
MATT: "Hell if I know! A bunch of ground-dwelling,
weird, dark elf folk."

01:36:55.208 --> 01:36:56.847
LAURA: Did you have to fight them?

01:36:57.147 --> 01:37:01.480
MATT: "Well, I fought a number of them myself,
trying to protect my buddies here, but

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.817
"not everyone was so lucky."

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:04.703
LAURA: You must be so brave.

01:37:04.749 --> 01:37:06.211
MATT: "Oh, no. Just--"

01:37:06.211 --> 01:37:07.992
LAURA: I mean, you look really brave.

01:37:07.992 --> 01:37:10.106
MATT: "I'm just doing my job, ma'am."

01:37:10.106 --> 01:37:20.317
LAURA: Wow! Well, all right. I guess I'll have to
go to another town for a potion. Can you point me

01:37:20.317 --> 01:37:23.178
in the direction of this shop?

01:37:23.609 --> 01:37:25.642
MATT: "The one that was here?"

01:37:25.642 --> 01:37:26.403
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:26.996 --> 01:37:31.577
MATT: "That's right over-- you go head down two
blocks and to the right, follow that on for about

01:37:31.577 --> 01:37:38.823
"seven, eight or so buildings on the left. It's
hard to miss. It's the second one on the left

01:37:38.823 --> 01:37:39.841
"that's burned down."

01:37:39.841 --> 01:37:42.892
LAURA: Okay. Hey, maybe the owner ran away
or something, right?

01:37:43.292 --> 01:37:44.796
MATT: "Here's to hoping."

01:37:45.409 --> 01:37:47.777
LAURA: Yeah. Fingers crossed!

01:37:47.777 --> 01:37:49.381
MATT: "Indeed."

01:37:49.841 --> 01:37:51.455
LAURA: (sighing)

01:37:51.997 --> 01:37:54.067
MATT: Is there anything else you're looking to
find out?

01:37:54.165 --> 01:37:58.169
LAURA: No, I just wanted to see if they saw him
leaving the town. That's all.

01:37:58.169 --> 01:38:02.001
MATT: You'd probably have to find somebody who was
a little more in the thick of it.

01:38:02.002 --> 01:38:02.931
LAURA: Yeah.

01:38:02.932 --> 01:38:04.728
TALIESIN: That soldier was totally hitting on
you.

01:38:05.183 --> 01:38:07.661
LAURA: A lot of soldiers hit on me. It's no big
deal.

01:38:07.661 --> 01:38:15.842
TALIESIN: He wasn't even here when the fighting
happened. He was lying. Sorry. So brave. Sorry.

01:38:17.782 --> 01:38:19.108
MATT: Anyone else want anything?

01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:21.356
MARISHA: I want to find Demi Leric.

01:38:21.827 --> 01:38:29.242
MATT: Okay. It takes you a little while. Not too
long with Nott's help guiding you in that

01:38:29.242 --> 01:38:35.856
direction, but finding the right building--
because the sign itself that has Demi Leric's name

01:38:35.856 --> 01:38:41.942
on it is itself smoke-covered from-- it's across
the street from one of the buildings that was

01:38:41.942 --> 01:38:47.778
damaged by the fire. As you walk over towards the
edge, the door is partially ajar.

01:38:49.262 --> 01:38:50.737
MARISHA: (knocking)

01:38:51.624 --> 01:39:04.873
MATT: "Wait just a minute! Now sit down. It's
going to hurt a bit longer. Come in!"

01:39:04.873 --> 01:39:09.668
You open the door, come inside. It's a very simple
establishment. Immediately the smell hits you of

01:39:11.408 --> 01:39:22.193
various smells like medicinal herbs and very
strong chemicals. You see four, five cots that are

01:39:22.193 --> 01:39:31.367
set up, two of which have recovering townsguard
that are bandaged up and currently laying down.

01:39:31.367 --> 01:39:35.932
One of them appears to be asleep. The other one is
sitting there with a fresh set of bandages put

01:39:35.932 --> 01:39:48.072
over burns. You see Demi turn around. Human woman,
maybe late 20s, early 30s or so, heavyset, bright

01:39:48.073 --> 01:39:54.913
smile, bright eyes, but sleeves rolled to the
elbows and all business. She turns around, and the

01:39:54.913 --> 01:40:04.150
fingers are hit with whatever material was used to
apply the burn bandages to the one soldier. She

01:40:04.150 --> 01:40:10.182
wipes her hands, this viscous oil-like substance,
and wipes them on a cloth. "Well, can I help you?"

01:40:10.202 --> 01:40:15.651
MARISHA: Hi, yes. I'm Beauregard of the Cobalt
Soul. I've been sent here from Zadash.

01:40:16.155 --> 01:40:17.952
MATT: "All right."

01:40:17.953 --> 01:40:21.524
MARISHA: If you have a few minutes, I would love
to ask you a few questions.

01:40:21.545 --> 01:40:24.171
MATT: "Certainly. Feel free to go and ask."

01:40:24.732 --> 01:40:30.005
MARISHA: We're taking statements from people,
trying to figure out some incongruencies that

01:40:30.005 --> 01:40:32.382
might have been happening over the past
few months.

01:40:32.432 --> 01:40:34.112
MATT: "Incongruency, all right."

01:40:34.192 --> 01:40:42.715
MARISHA: Did you ever notice any increased amount
of patients feeling sick, sluggish, anything off?

01:40:43.524 --> 01:40:48.954
MATT: "Well, I mean, they're pretty sluggish right
now, but that's for obvious reasons."

01:40:49.192 --> 01:40:55.472
MARISHA:. Not the most recent two weeks,
burnt-in-a-fire-type of off. Before then.

01:40:55.535 --> 01:41:04.443
MATT: "We've had a few strange complaints maybe
about a month, two months ago. Just a wave of

01:41:04.443 --> 01:41:13.582
"general, a nauseous-- I assumed it was maybe some
bad food that got through a bit. Wasn't too serious."

01:41:14.854 --> 01:41:22.286
MARISHA: Wave of nausea? Anything else? What makes
you think that they were related, as opposed to

01:41:22.286 --> 01:41:25.167
general food poisoning? What was strange
about them?

01:41:25.167 --> 01:41:29.687
MATT: "It was a bunch of people complaining about
the same thing in a very short period of time.

01:41:29.687 --> 01:41:31.316
"I assumed maybe it was related."

01:41:31.776 --> 01:41:35.022
MARISHA: Did they all happen to live in a similar
area of town?

01:41:35.022 --> 01:41:39.538
MATT: "Yeah, they were all in a cluster right in
this region, which is why they all came to me."

01:41:39.538 --> 01:41:45.029
MARISHA: All in a cluster. Sorry, just taking
notes, just want to make sure I get

01:41:45.029 --> 01:41:46.076
everything correct.

01:41:46.089 --> 01:41:47.597
MATT: "Yeah, no worries."

01:41:48.958 --> 01:41:57.687
MARISHA: Okay. Anything else that seems like it
might spark your memory of being a little bit odd?

01:41:59.971 --> 01:42:05.074
MATT: "I mean, the town was attacked, and people
were killed and burned. That's strange."

01:42:05.292 --> 01:42:11.112
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Did you know a man by the name of
Yeza?

01:42:11.533 --> 01:42:14.373
MATT: "Yeah, he was right down the street."

01:42:14.765 --> 01:42:19.803
MARISHA: Did he come in around that time with the
batch of people who were feeling nauseous?

01:42:20.111 --> 01:42:31.404
MATT: "No. To be honest, I was busy trying to
treat who I could. That was not a good day."

01:42:32.432 --> 01:42:33.785
MARISHA: It was all one day?

01:42:33.785 --> 01:42:39.534
MATT: "One night, really. Around midnight.
Suddenly buildings were up in flames, people were

01:42:39.534 --> 01:42:44.173
"screaming. I looked out there, and there were
cricks running through the street."

01:42:47.091 --> 01:42:50.462
MARISHA: Do you mind if I talk to a few of
your patients for a second?

01:42:50.762 --> 01:42:52.063
MATT: "Be my guest."

01:42:53.453 --> 01:43:06.055
MARISHA: If you think of anything, if you remember
anything-- I don't have a card, but I'm staying--

01:43:06.165 --> 01:43:08.632
I'll be in town. I might be back.

01:43:09.044 --> 01:43:13.786
MATT: "Great. Well, if you think of any other
questions, feel free to ask."

01:43:15.134 --> 01:43:16.804
MARISHA: Thank you, miss.

01:43:17.273 --> 01:43:20.184
SAM: Next time on Colum-Beau.

01:43:22.546 --> 01:43:26.134
MATT: What was the part where she then goes, "And
one more thing..."

01:43:26.499 --> 01:43:28.210
SAM: "One more question."

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:34.098
(multiple Columbo impressions)

01:43:34.201 --> 01:43:36.809
MATT: For our younger audience: Columbo was a
television series.

01:43:38.769 --> 01:43:41.440
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to go over to one
of the guards.

01:43:41.469 --> 01:43:45.717
MATT: Okay, there is one that appears to
be asleep, who looks to be a little more

01:43:45.717 --> 01:43:49.668
combat wounded. The one that's
semi-conscious is mostly burns.

01:43:51.028 --> 01:43:55.119
MARISHA: Is the one who's semi-conscious
conscious enough to speak?

01:43:55.599 --> 01:43:59.779
MATT: He seems to be. He's sitting there going
(pained breathing).

01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:03.330
MARISHA: I go up and slap one of his wounds.

01:44:03.529 --> 01:44:10.500
MATT: (pained yelling) "What is wrong with you?!
Who are you?!"

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:16.109
MARISHA: 'Sup? Name's Beau. With the Cobalt Soul.

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:17.019
MATT: "Great!"

01:44:17.059 --> 01:44:18.588
MARISHA: Yeah. What's your name?

01:44:19.269 --> 01:44:20.060
MATT: "Jeff."

01:44:20.501 --> 01:44:24.931
(laughter)

01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:28.230
SAM: Yeah, well, it's spelled weird. G-E-O-F-F.

01:44:28.409 --> 01:44:31.519
MATT: He's got two apostrophes between the Fs.

01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:37.370
LIAM: The umlaut's over the second F.

01:44:37.466 --> 01:44:40.720
MATT: Look, man. Not everyone in a fantasy setting
has awesome names.

01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:50.040
MARISHA: Good to meet you, Jeff. You patrol the
cluster normally?

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:55.199
MATT: "Yeah, when I'm not laid up like this."

01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:58.723
MARISHA: You look pretty badly burned, obviously.

01:44:58.801 --> 01:45:03.221
MATT: "Yeah, no. That's why I was really
appreciating your entrance there.

01:45:03.821 --> 01:45:04.832
"Very thoughtful."

01:45:05.895 --> 01:45:10.106
MARISHA: I give him a little bit of my wine from
my wine pouch.

01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.891
MATT: "I accept your recompense."

01:45:12.891 --> 01:45:13.681
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:45:14.485 --> 01:45:17.714
MATT: At this point, Demi's like, "Wait, wait,
wait! No, no, no!"

01:45:17.842 --> 01:45:19.945
MARISHA: Sorry, Demi, sorry.

01:45:21.161 --> 01:45:22.750
MATT: "He's already had enough."

01:45:25.352 --> 01:45:32.556
MARISHA: Jeff, I was curious if you happened to
know what happened to Yeza Ber-de-ger-de-ger--?

01:45:32.925 --> 01:45:33.750
TRAVIS: Brenatto?

01:45:33.757 --> 01:45:36.951
MARISHA: Brenatto, or if you were around when the
apothecary burned.

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:40.652
MATT: "Yeah. That's where I got all this."

01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:41.701
MARISHA: Oh.

01:45:42.235 --> 01:45:46.893
MATT: "Was trying to get people out of the flames.
Managed to get his son out, it seems."

01:45:47.469 --> 01:45:48.328
MARISHA: Really?

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.388
MATT: "Yeah. Cricks got him and ran."

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:52.045
MARISHA: The cricks got him?

01:45:52.050 --> 01:45:53.018
MATT: "Yeah."

01:45:53.412 --> 01:45:55.599
MARISHA: Did you see which direction they ran?

01:45:55.919 --> 01:45:58.799
MATT: "Back to the fucking hole. They headed
northward."

01:45:58.799 --> 01:46:00.659
MARISHA: You're sure it was the cricks?

01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:03.039
MATT: "Yeah! Was four of them."

01:46:04.675 --> 01:46:07.468
MARISHA: Okay. Did you see anything else?

01:46:08.532 --> 01:46:12.236
MATT: "Yeah, I saw the fire they pushed me into
when I tried to stop them!"

01:46:15.867 --> 01:46:17.915
MARISHA: You were the one who got Luke out?

01:46:18.127 --> 01:46:23.044
MATT: "Well, me and two others, but they didn't,
you know, fare as poorly as I did."

01:46:25.204 --> 01:46:32.155
MARISHA: All right. Anything else you remember,
anything spark in your mind trying to figure this

01:46:32.155 --> 01:46:37.196
shit out? I know that's vague.

01:46:37.979 --> 01:46:42.557
MATT: "Yeah. Yeah it is. I mean, it was crazy.
They came in quick.

01:46:43.357 --> 01:46:45.887
"Fires were set before we knew what was happening."

01:46:46.387 --> 01:46:49.831
MARISHA: Did you feel like they were looking
for something in particular?

01:46:51.232 --> 01:46:52.699
Were they targeting places?

01:46:54.009 --> 01:47:00.374
MATT: "I guess? The last place they lit was the
apothecary."

01:47:03.403 --> 01:47:12.143
MARISHA: Okay. Well, look; you did a good thing,
all right, man? You saved a kid.

01:47:13.227 --> 01:47:14.123
MATT: "Thanks?"

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:18.663
MARISHA: My friend's kid. I don't really care
about the kid, but it was my friend's kid, so...

01:47:19.363 --> 01:47:23.276
here. I pull out 20 gold, throw it on the table.

01:47:23.562 --> 01:47:25.174
MATT: His eyes go wide.

01:47:25.262 --> 01:47:30.170
MARISHA: You can split that up with your friends,
or if you want to keep it, I don't really give a fuck.

01:47:31.735 --> 01:47:33.596
MATT: "So you're from the Cobalt Soul?"

01:47:33.716 --> 01:47:40.307
MARISHA: Yep! Bye! Then I run away.

01:47:42.798 --> 01:47:43.686
MATT: Perfect.

01:47:43.806 --> 01:47:44.637
LAURA: Traci?

01:47:45.496 --> 01:47:52.655
LIAM: Hey, Laura. Hey, Laura. That's a pretty good
penis you drew over there. It's very lifelike.

01:47:52.655 --> 01:47:54.036
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's big!

01:47:54.036 --> 01:47:55.334
LAURA: Sam told me to!

01:47:55.334 --> 01:47:58.285
TRAVIS: Did you hear what was revealed in that
moment just now?

01:47:58.285 --> 01:48:00.047
MARISHA: It's coming from the depths.

01:48:00.555 --> 01:48:02.895
LIAM: Looks like some stuff happened there, too.

01:48:06.421 --> 01:48:08.062
SAM: This is serious, guys.

01:48:10.549 --> 01:48:13.571
MATT: Anybody else doing anything before
you guys reconvene?

01:48:18.621 --> 01:48:22.005
Is there anything else you want to look
for, or are you ready to gather?

01:48:23.572 --> 01:48:26.135
LAURA: It feels like we're supposed to do
something.

01:48:26.135 --> 01:48:29.326
MATT: No, I'm just curious. If you've completed
your investigation--

01:48:29.334 --> 01:48:33.943
TALIESIN: Oh, oh! Is there a furniture maker in
town? Because I really would like to ask them

01:48:33.943 --> 01:48:35.233
questions about that chair.

01:48:35.233 --> 01:48:37.991
SAM: My husband is missing!

01:48:37.991 --> 01:48:42.612
TALIESIN: I'm done, I'm done! I'm good. This is my
attempt to rally everybody. It worked. I swear.

01:48:42.612 --> 01:48:46.946
Don't look at me like that, jesus.
Oh god, there's just dicks over there,

01:48:46.958 --> 01:48:48.705
I don't know what to do.

01:48:48.706 --> 01:48:51.279
MATT: There's no escape, Taliesin.
There's no escaping.

01:48:52.449 --> 01:48:54.878
TALIESIN: Just potential dicks, now. That's better.

01:48:54.878 --> 01:48:56.308
MARISHA: Just potential dicks.

01:48:56.318 --> 01:48:58.378
LAURA: Yeah. The opportunities...

01:48:59.407 --> 01:49:04.166
TRAVIS: Are there specific areas where the tunnels
were collapsed after they went back in

01:49:04.166 --> 01:49:05.294
and covered them up?

01:49:05.294 --> 01:49:07.052
MATT: You can go look if you want to.

01:49:07.052 --> 01:49:08.670
SAM: Yeah, we should look.

01:49:08.681 --> 01:49:10.250
MARISHA: Are we meeting back up?

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.657
LAURA: Yeah, we should meet up and then search.

01:49:12.701 --> 01:49:18.517
MARISHA: All right, meet back up. I kick down the
door and I go: Apparently he was taken by cricks!

01:49:18.517 --> 01:49:19.702
Then I fill them in.

01:49:19.703 --> 01:49:20.584
SAM: Wait, he was?

01:49:20.584 --> 01:49:22.098
LAURA: Can we call them Kryn, please?

01:49:22.263 --> 01:49:23.779
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Kryn?

01:49:23.779 --> 01:49:25.559
LAURA: That's what they actually are.

01:49:25.624 --> 01:49:27.587
MARISHA: Apparently he was taken by Kryn!

01:49:28.207 --> 01:49:31.270
SAM: He was taken by Kryn? Not by--

01:49:32.648 --> 01:49:34.997
MARISHA: I talked to some soldier boy named Jeff.

01:49:35.421 --> 01:49:36.254
SAM: Weird name.

01:49:36.254 --> 01:49:39.135
MARISHA: I know, right? His parents must not have
loved him.

01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.850
LAURA: I think Jeff's a really nice name.

01:49:41.866 --> 01:49:45.205
TRAVIS: Yeah, a lot of Jeffs right now are fucking
giving you the bird.

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:48.528
MATT: Jeff's a great name, that's why I used it.

01:49:48.537 --> 01:49:50.447
LAURA: Jeff is a great name. Keep going.

01:49:50.467 --> 01:49:51.887
TRAVIS: Yeah, keep digging.

01:49:54.612 --> 01:49:56.369
SAM: Tell me what Jeff fucking said!

01:49:56.775 --> 01:50:01.955
MARISHA: He said four Kryn came in, scooped up
your husband, and ran off.

01:50:01.955 --> 01:50:03.415
SAM: Wait, he saw that happen?

01:50:03.415 --> 01:50:06.699
MARISHA: Yeah, he was there. He ran in and
he saved your son.

01:50:07.099 --> 01:50:09.055
SAM: Well, shit, this changes everything.

01:50:09.055 --> 01:50:19.113
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. What is the possibility
that your mean people can change memories?

01:50:22.871 --> 01:50:24.220
LIAM: Pretty good.

01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:32.410
TALIESIN: Still, we should at least investigate
this lead now, and tomorrow, if we don't know

01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:36.991
what's going on, I can-- and I warn you, I will do
this, but I'm going to get a little exhausted

01:50:36.991 --> 01:50:41.882
doing it-- I can at least give us some sense of
what's ahead.

01:50:41.882 --> 01:50:45.679
LAURA: Should I try to send him a message and
see if he responds?

01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:48.613
TRAVIS: Couldn't hurt.

01:50:48.655 --> 01:50:50.224
SAM and TALIESIN: It could hurt.

01:50:51.115 --> 01:50:56.455
SAM: It could definitely hurt. If she sends a
message and he's with the Rexxentrum folks--

01:50:56.455 --> 01:50:57.616
LAURA: Would they know?

01:50:57.616 --> 01:50:59.395
SAM: They might be able to sense that.

01:50:59.395 --> 01:51:02.326
LIAM: Are you talking about what Nott and I do
or what you do?

01:51:02.326 --> 01:51:03.214
LAURA: What I do.

01:51:03.664 --> 01:51:06.483
LIAM: That's between you and your god, Jester.

01:51:07.114 --> 01:51:10.184
TRAVIS: Can't they respond to your messages?

01:51:10.595 --> 01:51:16.539
LAURA: Well, yeah, but I can say, "Don't respond
if you're by anybody that, you know--"

01:51:16.539 --> 01:51:18.684
TRAVIS: Or "If you're alive, just say ow"?

01:51:18.885 --> 01:51:22.065
LAURA: Oh, that's good. What if I do that?

01:51:22.404 --> 01:51:31.138
SAM: Why don't we try Mr. Clay's idea first? See
if he's alive and then we'll try to send a message.

01:51:31.197 --> 01:51:35.108
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at these tunnels. I'm
actually very curious about this.

01:51:35.108 --> 01:51:39.676
TRAVIS: We'll go find a nearby crownsguard and see
if they can point us in the direction of where

01:51:39.676 --> 01:51:41.441
some of those collapsed tunnels were.

01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:43.690
MATT: Okay. So you heading to the tunnel first?

01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:44.410
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:51:44.879 --> 01:51:46.348
LIAM: Is it dark yet?

01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:51.980
MATT: By this point, you guys gathering, yeah, dusk
has happened. You can eat first or miss your meal.

01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:54.687
LAURA: We only have an hour. We need to get
our free food.

01:51:54.688 --> 01:51:58.018
TALIESIN: We'll get a little food and then we'll
check it out by night.

01:51:58.018 --> 01:52:04.930
MATT: The meal is actually quite fresh.
Being a farm town, it's nothing fancy, but

01:52:04.930 --> 01:52:13.779
everything's hearty and quite delectable. Heading
your way outside of Felderwin, to the northeast

01:52:13.779 --> 01:52:20.099
side where it begins to border on the Tillage
itself, there's a group of about eight crownsguard

01:52:20.099 --> 01:52:28.819
that are circled around three-- what would have
been the exit burrows. From this distance, you can

01:52:28.819 --> 01:52:37.159
see it's like a sinkhole. It's caved in a bit.
From this distance, you can't see any further than

01:52:37.159 --> 01:52:42.679
a few inches to indicate that that seems to be
where it was, and the guards are keeping a

01:52:42.687 --> 01:52:45.958
perimeter just in case anything were to return.

01:52:45.958 --> 01:52:49.098
TRAVIS: I'll walk up. Excuse me!

01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:51.830
MATT: As you approach he's like, "Hi,
can I help you?"

01:52:51.989 --> 01:52:56.058
TRAVIS: Yeah, sorry, we're just passing by.
We heard this was the scene of

01:52:56.058 --> 01:52:58.667
all the unfortunateness.

01:52:58.907 --> 01:53:00.738
MATT: "Yeah, that's what I hear, too."

01:53:01.815 --> 01:53:08.048
TRAVIS: Has it been cased, this area? Searched
for, I don't know, anything left over by the

01:53:08.048 --> 01:53:09.688
invading hordes?

01:53:09.787 --> 01:53:14.502
MATT: "As far as I know. I'm just stationed here,
but they've been looking this thing up and down

01:53:14.502 --> 01:53:16.933
"for two, almost three weeks now."

01:53:16.946 --> 01:53:17.943
TRAVIS: Who's they?

01:53:18.504 --> 01:53:25.455
MATT: "The guard, the Righteous Brand. Some of
them fancy folk from Rexxentrum."

01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:26.672
TRAVIS: Fancy?

01:53:27.139 --> 01:53:31.707
MATT: "Yeah, I mean, they're all fucking fancy
from up there, but some of them elvish people."

01:53:31.841 --> 01:53:34.736
TRAVIS: Oh, I think I saw them.
What were they doing?

01:53:34.965 --> 01:53:37.455
MATT: "I don't fucking know. They don't talk to me."

01:53:37.785 --> 01:53:41.737
TRAVIS: Fair enough. You know if they found
anything, took anything out of the dirt?

01:53:42.581 --> 01:53:43.417
MATT: "No."

01:53:45.356 --> 01:53:49.596
TRAVIS: They tell you that these might open up
again, or they might be in imminent peril?

01:53:49.596 --> 01:53:51.464
I see there's eight of you guys.

01:53:51.471 --> 01:53:57.741
MATT: "I certainly hope not. From what I can tell,
wasn't just the cricks." Then one of the

01:53:57.741 --> 01:54:01.878
other guys, one of the soldiers, goes like,
"I was here. I saw it."

01:54:01.964 --> 01:54:03.282
TRAVIS: You were here?

01:54:03.282 --> 01:54:09.594
MATT: "Yeah, no, I mean, they didn't dig them.
Something dug it for them."

01:54:10.293 --> 01:54:11.343
TRAVIS: Is that right?

01:54:11.363 --> 01:54:17.092
MATT: "It was a big old mouth made of teeth just
carved out of the ground and then withdrew,

01:54:17.092 --> 01:54:18.374
"and then they poured out."

01:54:18.831 --> 01:54:20.603
TRAVIS: My god, that sounds terrible.

01:54:20.603 --> 01:54:23.994
MATT: "Yeah, yeah! I hate this job."

01:54:24.004 --> 01:54:26.906
TRAVIS: When you saw the
big mouth with teeth? What'd you do?

01:54:26.906 --> 01:54:29.477
MATT: "Fucking ran! What do you think
I'm going to do?"

01:54:29.477 --> 01:54:31.715
TRAVIS: Damn right, fast as you could I'll bet.

01:54:31.716 --> 01:54:35.138
MATT: The other guys look at him, like
(scoffing) and he's like, "What?!

01:54:35.138 --> 01:54:36.472
"You would've done the same!"

01:54:36.472 --> 01:54:38.327
LAURA: Was it like a worm or something?

01:54:38.328 --> 01:54:39.946
MATT: "Something like that, yeah."

01:54:39.946 --> 01:54:42.994
TRAVIS: Did it come out of the ground
or did it go back in after?

01:54:42.994 --> 01:54:47.398
MATT: "No, it broke through but just came out a
few feet, and then it pulled back in.

01:54:47.569 --> 01:54:51.423
"We were like, 'What the fuck is that?'
Then the cricks came running out."

01:54:52.007 --> 01:54:54.759
LAURA: Do you think the Kryn
came out of the worm thing?

01:54:55.071 --> 01:54:56.845
MATT: "I mean, it's possible."

01:54:57.061 --> 01:54:59.889
TRAVIS: How big was this creature?

01:55:00.172 --> 01:55:09.312
MATT: "I don't know, it was big. From what I saw
it was maybe, I don't know, ten feet wide?"

01:55:09.586 --> 01:55:16.914
TRAVIS: Wow, that's significant. Were you also here
or far away when they made their hasty retreat?

01:55:17.549 --> 01:55:23.977
MATT: "I was over there." He points off maybe
a hundred or so feet away.

01:55:24.364 --> 01:55:25.647
TRAVIS: Keeping an eye out?

01:55:25.733 --> 01:55:26.490
MATT: "Yeah."

01:55:26.882 --> 01:55:31.495
TRAVIS: Could you see anything that was driving
them off or were they just taking their sweet time

01:55:31.495 --> 01:55:32.399
as they left?

01:55:33.233 --> 01:55:38.565
MATT: At this point the other, first guard you
were talking to goes, "Hey, what's your

01:55:38.565 --> 01:55:39.754
"business here, anyway?"

01:55:40.616 --> 01:55:49.494
TRAVIS: We've come across these cricks before. We
saw them in Zadash. There was a big ruckus in the

01:55:49.494 --> 01:55:55.383
middle of the city. Trying to learn all we can.
I don't know when we'll come across them next.

01:55:55.383 --> 01:55:57.490
I feel like share and share alike, you know?

01:56:00.845 --> 01:56:03.402
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:56:08.052 --> 01:56:08.889
TRAVIS: 16.

01:56:11.156 --> 01:56:19.147
MATT: He nods for a second and goes, "All right,
so, I guess have a look around. It's already been

01:56:19.147 --> 01:56:22.659
"given the once-over many times,
so take a moment if you need it."

01:56:22.684 --> 01:56:25.601
SAM: Has anyone gone down and
followed the tunnels?

01:56:25.946 --> 01:56:30.092
MATT: He points over the third one and he goes,
"They've been digging that one for about

01:56:30.092 --> 01:56:31.750
"two weeks, but eventually gave up."

01:56:32.217 --> 01:56:33.737
TRAVIS: Why'd they stop?

01:56:34.395 --> 01:56:39.033
MATT: "They collapsed them behind them and there's
only so much you can go. If they dug all the way

01:56:39.033 --> 01:56:42.407
"from Xhorhas, do you have any idea how long those
tunnels would go for?"

01:56:42.407 --> 01:56:43.387
TRAVIS: Pretty long.

01:56:43.482 --> 01:56:47.820
MATT: "Don't really have that kind of manpower
here in Felderwin. The soldiers all left, so

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:50.008
"I'm not going to keep digging."

01:56:50.482 --> 01:56:55.315
TRAVIS: I appreciate it. We won't take up much of
your time. We thought we'd have a gander around,

01:56:55.315 --> 01:56:56.387
if that's all right.

01:56:56.588 --> 01:57:00.754
MATT: "Eh, go for it. How many you got?"

01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:04.470
LAURA: Seven?

01:57:06.641 --> 01:57:08.603
MATT: "And you're all investigating?"

01:57:10.014 --> 01:57:12.534
LAURA: Some of us are just hanging out.

01:57:13.803 --> 01:57:21.904
TALIESIN: It wasn't our intention, but things
being what they are, this seems to be the

01:57:21.904 --> 01:57:23.722
new reality of the world, doesn't it?

01:57:23.724 --> 01:57:27.153
MATT: "All right, just no funny business.
I'll be keeping an eye on you."

01:57:27.153 --> 01:57:33.856
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Being that fancy folk were
here, I don't suppose there's any point in doing

01:57:33.856 --> 01:57:36.763
our particular brand of searching.

01:57:37.322 --> 01:57:45.503
LAURA: I have a question. When you Blink out--
I haven't done it very much, but I feel like it's

01:57:45.503 --> 01:57:47.911
the Ethereal Plane, right, that we go to?

01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:49.313
TRAVIS: The what?

01:57:49.563 --> 01:57:50.814
LAURA: The Ethereal Plane?

01:57:51.343 --> 01:57:52.362
TRAVIS: What is that?

01:57:52.581 --> 01:57:55.722
LAURA: It's another plane.
The Traveler told me about it.

01:57:56.445 --> 01:57:58.835
TRAVIS: I don't talk to The Traveler.

01:57:58.873 --> 01:58:05.134
LAURA: Oh. Well, I feel like we go to this other
plane, right? You can walk through things on that

01:58:05.135 --> 01:58:13.104
plane, because it's not quite the same. So what if
we Blinked, and then we could go through where

01:58:13.104 --> 01:58:19.453
they collapsed the tunnel? Then we could be in the
tunnel and just see, you know? Then come back!

01:58:20.515 --> 01:58:26.295
TRAVIS: That's a good idea, except for what if the
whole tunnel's collapsed and we Blink into the earth?

01:58:27.955 --> 01:58:31.952
LAURA: Well, I don't think you can do that. Right?

01:58:32.124 --> 01:58:36.494
TRAVIS: I mean, I imagine anything is possible
in this world of magic and mystery,

01:58:36.494 --> 01:58:38.705
but I bet it would hurt a lot.

01:58:40.352 --> 01:58:43.786
LAURA: You can't Blink if the spot is taken up, right?

01:58:44.253 --> 01:58:50.465
MATT: I would say if you were attempting to Blink
into a solid space, it would shunt you out of the

01:58:50.466 --> 01:58:54.923
space and you would take a little bit of force
damage. General rules for shifting out of

01:58:54.923 --> 01:58:57.753
ethereal space into matter.

01:58:57.997 --> 01:59:01.848
LAURA: I'm not trying to Dimension Door.
That one scares me a bit.

01:59:01.848 --> 01:59:06.226
TRAVIS: I don't know about you, but when I Blink,
I can only appear about ten feet from where

01:59:06.226 --> 01:59:07.449
I previously was.

01:59:07.449 --> 01:59:14.715
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean! We Blink right
here. Then we walk where the tunnel was and we

01:59:14.716 --> 01:59:15.915
go into the tunnel.

01:59:16.735 --> 01:59:19.114
TALIESIN: I can walk through stone.

01:59:19.456 --> 01:59:21.264
LAURA: Or we could just do that.

01:59:22.224 --> 01:59:23.314
TRAVIS: That's better.

01:59:23.745 --> 01:59:29.374
TALIESIN: I mean, I'd want to know where I was
going, and I can only go alone.

01:59:30.234 --> 01:59:35.275
LIAM: I'm no expert on worms, but I would imagine
that it is more collapsed earth than open space.

01:59:35.294 --> 01:59:37.113
TALIESIN: I would imagine so as well.

01:59:37.113 --> 01:59:40.827
LIAM: They chew their way their way through the
earth and poop out the remains.

01:59:40.827 --> 01:59:42.670
TALIESIN: Just honey all the way back.

01:59:43.083 --> 01:59:45.286
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Or molasses.

01:59:47.218 --> 01:59:48.753
MARISHA: So much nature poop.

01:59:51.339 --> 01:59:52.848
SAM: So our choices are--?

01:59:53.254 --> 01:59:58.110
TALIESIN: We should have this conversation in here,
because I want to take a look around in this thing.

01:59:58.110 --> 01:59:59.014
SAM: In the tunnel?

01:59:59.015 --> 02:00:01.012
TALIESIN: Yeah, they offered us.

02:00:01.237 --> 02:00:03.099
TRAVIS: It's sunken earth, right?

02:00:03.434 --> 02:00:10.806
MATT: You approach and see there are three
tunnels, and they're scattered maybe 300 feet

02:00:10.806 --> 02:00:15.321
apart from each other, approximately. Between 200
and 300 feet. The first one you're at here sinks

02:00:15.322 --> 02:00:22.714
in about ten, 15 feet; and it looks like crumbled
stone and earth with patches of fresh dirt, and

02:00:22.714 --> 02:00:29.484
the roots that were upended as it tore through
folding over onto the pile. It looks like it's

02:00:29.484 --> 02:00:35.405
been left as it was. You go over and inspect the
other one and the same guard and few others walk

02:00:35.405 --> 02:00:39.625
with you to keep a close eye. The one in the
middle, this is the one that's been dug out.

02:00:40.535 --> 02:00:42.666
It's just pitch black below.

02:00:42.698 --> 02:00:43.481
TALIESIN: Light.

02:00:44.098 --> 02:00:48.706
MATT: Okay, you cast Light. The soldiers take a
step back as soon as they see you make a gesture

02:00:48.706 --> 02:00:51.055
and brightness seems to appear.

02:00:51.996 --> 02:00:53.522
TALIESIN: It's all in the stone.

02:00:53.522 --> 02:00:59.805
MATT: Yeah. The tunnel goes straight down. Well,
close to straight down. It comes at a fairly steep

02:00:59.805 --> 02:01:10.023
incline. There is a rope affixed to a heavy wooden
pike that's been banged into the ground.

02:01:11.303 --> 02:01:12.929
Do you head down inside?

02:01:13.211 --> 02:01:16.976
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah. Unless anybody's got an
objection.

02:01:16.976 --> 02:01:21.335
TRAVIS: Nope. Oh, you're doing your walk thing.

02:01:21.945 --> 02:01:23.536
TALIESIN: No, I'm just walking.

02:01:24.505 --> 02:01:28.495
MATT: Your walk, technically, can only go
something that's five feet inward.

02:01:28.495 --> 02:01:30.291
You can't just glide through stone.

02:01:30.292 --> 02:01:34.434
TALIESIN: Oh, is that true? Oh. I didn't know
that. Well, I don't have that as an option

02:01:34.434 --> 02:01:35.294
right now, anyway.

02:01:35.294 --> 02:01:45.104
MATT: There you go. You head down inside, and off
to the side of it there's a small pile of dirt and

02:01:45.104 --> 02:01:50.586
rock. It looks like a lot of it has been moved off
of the premises for the time being. As you head

02:01:50.586 --> 02:02:00.106
down and continue to walk, it evens out. It
probably descends to a depth of about 50 or 60

02:02:00.106 --> 02:02:06.905
feet below and continues at a steady decline on
for about another-- as you continue to walk,

02:02:06.905 --> 02:02:14.007
continuing to walk, you get to a full close to 200
feet in before it comes to an ending point.

02:02:14.007 --> 02:02:21.144
There's a few carts at the base carrying dirt and
rock up. You can see shovels and pickaxes and all

02:02:21.145 --> 02:02:26.838
sorts of materials that have been left behind by
the team that gave up trying to excavate this tunnel.

02:02:32.386 --> 02:02:39.413
TALIESIN: There's no marking on it? This is an
obviously organically-carved tunnel?

02:02:39.853 --> 02:02:41.004
MATT: Looks to be, yeah.

02:02:41.767 --> 02:02:44.983
TALIESIN: The footprints going in and out, there's
nothing--

02:02:45.494 --> 02:02:46.853
MATT: Make a survival check.

02:02:47.165 --> 02:02:54.077
TALIESIN: Wow. Never really done one of those. 19.

02:02:54.877 --> 02:03:00.515
MATT: Okay. There are all sorts of footprints in
here. There have been soldiers and crownsguard and

02:03:00.515 --> 02:03:05.125
all sorts of people in and out of this tunnel. You
can see cart tracks and everything, but you can

02:03:05.125 --> 02:03:11.418
definitely tell that the edges of the top of the
tunnel have a smoother, natural carving to them,

02:03:11.418 --> 02:03:19.795
whatever creature it is definitely burrowed. With
that roll, I'd say you do make out a few footsteps

02:03:19.796 --> 02:03:25.921
that resemble more armored boots that are more
unique against the profile of the general

02:03:25.921 --> 02:03:28.966
crownsguard and/or Righteous Brand soldiers.

02:03:29.036 --> 02:03:30.446
TALIESIN: In both directions?

02:03:30.777 --> 02:03:32.175
MATT: In both directions.

02:03:32.381 --> 02:03:39.925
TALIESIN: All right. Interesting. Very
interesting. They were definitely in here

02:03:39.925 --> 02:03:41.571
and they definitely left this way.

02:03:43.557 --> 02:03:48.914
TRAVIS: Any reason to use your radar and
see if anything was missed?

02:03:50.067 --> 02:03:52.372
TALIESIN: My radar? What do you mean?

02:03:52.625 --> 02:03:55.836
TRAVIS: Anything magical. Anything arcane.

02:03:57.026 --> 02:03:58.249
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

02:03:58.438 --> 02:04:03.333
MATT: Okay. Nothing in the vicinity catches your
attention, unfortunately.

02:04:04.386 --> 02:04:10.417
TALIESIN: Nothing, really. Just for fun, because
we can, Eyes of the Grave, too. Just for fun.

02:04:10.417 --> 02:04:13.078
MATT: Okay. Nothing catches your attention there either.

02:04:13.078 --> 02:04:15.744
TALIESIN: No? I figured. Nothing.

02:04:16.392 --> 02:04:26.186
SAM: So we could continue following this tunnel
for several hundred miles and see where it goes,

02:04:26.186 --> 02:04:37.429
or we could take my son to Alfield, or we could
head to Rexxentrum and start tracking down

02:04:37.429 --> 02:04:39.223
Caleb's old teachers.

02:04:40.547 --> 02:04:41.897
TRAVIS: They're still here.

02:04:42.615 --> 02:04:45.838
SAM: They are? I thought they bamfed out.

02:04:45.838 --> 02:04:47.986
LIAM: We don't know. We don't really know.

02:04:47.986 --> 02:04:52.144
TRAVIS: No, they bamfed in. Didn't see them leave.

02:04:53.104 --> 02:04:55.604
LIAM: Yeah, but they can do that in a basement.

02:04:55.670 --> 02:04:58.170
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we can kill them too.

02:05:00.169 --> 02:05:03.568
SAM: I'm all for it. What do we do?

02:05:03.599 --> 02:05:08.179
MARISHA: I feel like we shouldn't try and
assassinate the head of the Cerberus Assembly;

02:05:08.179 --> 02:05:09.421
not right now, maybe.

02:05:09.679 --> 02:05:11.170
LAURA: This is overwhelming!

02:05:11.291 --> 02:05:14.170
TRAVIS: Just as a warm up. All right?

02:05:16.481 --> 02:05:18.800
SAM: Do we know anyone who can help us?

02:05:20.888 --> 02:05:24.259
MARISHA: We just made an alliance,
sort of, with Yussa.

02:05:24.827 --> 02:05:26.698
LAURA: Yussa's pretty powerful.

02:05:26.707 --> 02:05:28.579
SAM: We can't get back there for weeks.

02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:29.928
TALIESIN: We could message.

02:05:29.928 --> 02:05:31.769
LAURA: I could send him a message!

02:05:31.828 --> 02:05:33.867
MARISHA: We could also go back to Zadash.

02:05:35.367 --> 02:05:36.707
SAM: We know folks there.

02:05:37.063 --> 02:05:38.214
LAURA: Yeah, we do.

02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:45.321
TALIESIN: In the morning, and I can't guarantee
this, but we'll at least know if he's alive and

02:05:45.322 --> 02:05:52.289
maybe a sense of whether or not he's above ground
or below ground and that'll certainly inform our decision.

02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:53.031
LAURA: Yeah.

02:05:55.851 --> 02:06:02.101
TALIESIN: Maybe. I'll glean what I can but,
it's a soft process.

02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:03.660
SAM: Okay.

02:06:04.321 --> 02:06:10.099
TRAVIS: Do we want to abandon this tunnel?
I can jump forward 90 feet in a direction.

02:06:10.279 --> 02:06:14.573
LAURA: If you bamf forward and there is stuff
blocking the way, will you get really hurt?

02:06:14.573 --> 02:06:17.161
TRAVIS: I don't know. I think I'll get shunted
out.

02:06:17.161 --> 02:06:20.209
MARISHA: Are you talking about the thundery one
that's real loud?

02:06:20.209 --> 02:06:21.781
LAURA: That's a little different.

02:06:21.781 --> 02:06:22.881
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one.

02:06:22.881 --> 02:06:23.581
LAURA: Right?

02:06:23.661 --> 02:06:27.191
MARISHA: It won't collapse the tunnel on our heads
when you do it, will it?

02:06:27.191 --> 02:06:29.451
SAM: Or we could just walk 90 feet ahead.

02:06:30.098 --> 02:06:31.479
LAURA: The tunnel is blocked.

02:06:31.528 --> 02:06:32.228
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:06:32.699 --> 02:06:35.179
LAURA: About 200 feet in, the tunnel is blocked.

02:06:35.598 --> 02:06:38.039
LIAM: We have no idea how deep the blockage goes.

02:06:38.534 --> 02:06:42.969
MATT: Just so you're aware, Thunder Step, as
most teleportation effects, you have to teleport

02:06:42.969 --> 02:06:44.529
to a location you can see.

02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:47.159
TRAVIS: In my mind's eye!

02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:51.864
MATT: I mean, if you want to get real crazy,
roll the dice!

02:06:52.809 --> 02:06:55.029
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (singing) Roll the dice!

02:06:55.029 --> 02:06:58.950
TALIESIN: I'm going to try something really
quickly, just for fun. I'm going to use

02:06:58.950 --> 02:07:08.309
Thaumaturgy really quickly and I'm going to
broadcast a low bass chant and I'm going to

02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:13.560
throw it as far forward down that tunnel as I
possibly can to see if I can get some sort of

02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:23.481
vibration coming back that they can hear. I'm
going to start throwing this (low bass humming).

02:07:23.481 --> 02:07:33.344
If there's air to vibrate or I'm making sound in
solid rock as a boosting of your-- It may not work.

02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:34.798
MATT: I see what you're doing.

02:07:35.822 --> 02:07:38.487
TALIESIN: Trying to use some sort of nature theory here.

02:07:38.558 --> 02:07:43.203
MATT: That's interesting. It's a cantrip, so
there's definite limitations on its ability.

02:07:43.539 --> 02:07:45.155
SAM: It's the most powerful spell.

02:07:45.168 --> 02:07:49.406
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy and I'm like: Whoa,
that's really cool! Did you see it? There's a

02:07:49.406 --> 02:07:51.955
bunch of whispers of people going,
"That's so cool!"

02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:57.707
TALIESIN: You can get really loud. That's the
question, is can I get loud enough to hear myself

02:07:57.707 --> 02:08:02.231
like if I was trapped in there? Or am I-- yeah.

02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:06.513
MATT: I'll say two things: One, roll just a
straight wisdom check for me.

02:08:07.701 --> 02:08:12.421
TALIESIN: Straight wisdom check. 13.

02:08:12.581 --> 02:08:19.765
MATT: 13, okay. You close your eyes and focus,
feeling your feet connecting with the earth below

02:08:19.765 --> 02:08:26.383
you, letting the Wildmother's power suffuse your
torso, your abdomen, your legs, and your feet into

02:08:26.383 --> 02:08:31.474
the earth below as you begin to release that low
vibration. The hum carries through your body and

02:08:31.475 --> 02:08:36.425
into rock below and the vibration carries into the
ground and due to the nature of this cavern you're

02:08:36.425 --> 02:08:44.022
in, it echoes pretty loudly in this space. You all
can gently feel it and the guards in the back

02:08:44.022 --> 02:08:48.672
start looking around a bit nervous, not quite sure
what's happening. One of them runs off afraid.

02:08:48.672 --> 02:08:50.392
He's like, "It's going to collapse!"

02:08:50.525 --> 02:08:52.552
LAURA: I'm picturing like a didgeridoo.

02:08:52.731 --> 02:08:56.251
LAURA and TALIESIN: (low rumbling noises)

02:08:56.521 --> 02:09:03.902
MATT: You've run it for awhile, you've cast the
vibration into the rock. What are you going to do

02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:05.261
to try and listen for?

02:09:05.361 --> 02:09:09.691
TALIESIN: Honestly? I'm going to try and see and
cut it off to see if there's an echo coming

02:09:09.691 --> 02:09:12.150
through the rocks, basically, in that split second.

02:09:12.291 --> 02:09:14.030
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:09:14.311 --> 02:09:18.663
TALIESIN: Into it! 18.

02:09:20.191 --> 02:09:25.076
MATT: You immediately rush up to edge of where
the stone is, the most solid piece of it that's on

02:09:25.076 --> 02:09:40.161
that side and listen. You feel like you can very
vaguely hear what might be gap a ways in at some

02:09:40.161 --> 02:09:46.746
point. You're not sure how far away it might be
and you're not sure how big the gap may be.

02:09:47.114 --> 02:09:53.299
It could be just a small pocket, it could be a
continuation of the tunnel, but there does appear

02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:59.596
to be some minor element of vibration that carried
through with some differentiation.

02:10:00.218 --> 02:10:02.635
TALIESIN: How deep are we underground right now?

02:10:03.222 --> 02:10:07.907
MATT: At the full end of this tunnel? I'd say
you're about 80 or so feet deep.

02:10:08.295 --> 02:10:12.864
TALIESIN: Okay, cool. I'm just going to do that.
I'm not going to inform anybody of anything that

02:10:12.864 --> 02:10:14.866
just happened and be like: Okay, I'm good.

02:10:16.232 --> 02:10:17.167
MARISHA: All right.

02:10:17.193 --> 02:10:18.852
TRAVIS and SAM: Back to the inn.

02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:20.841
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

02:10:20.871 --> 02:10:25.902
MATT: As you guys gather your thoughts, and march
back to the inn in the evening air over Felderwin,

02:10:25.902 --> 02:10:27.338
we're going to take a break.

02:10:27.338 --> 02:10:28.817
ALL: Woo!

02:10:29.301 --> 02:10:33.783
MATT: We're going to be right back here in a few
minutes. In the interim, we have our fantastic

02:10:33.783 --> 02:10:39.481
friends at Wyrmwood's Wyrmwood giveaway!
Run, run like the wind.

02:10:39.481 --> 02:10:43.312
SAM: She's running. She has to go do the other D&amp;D
streaming show that she's on.

02:10:43.312 --> 02:10:44.315
MATT: Exactly.

02:10:44.481 --> 02:10:46.405
TALIESIN: Wow. That was good.

02:10:46.996 --> 02:10:51.656
MATT: This is Bolivian rosewood. Nice leather
interior there, really nice dice box going to one

02:10:51.656 --> 02:10:58.790
of our friends out there. For you guys wanting
to enter this drawing at the break, head on over

02:10:58.790 --> 02:11:03.515
to the Critical Role Twitch chat, that's
twitch.tv/criticalrole, and enter the

02:11:03.515 --> 02:11:07.325
key phrase "tension." T-E-N-S-I-O-N.

02:11:08.065 --> 02:11:09.548
SAM: How did you know?

02:11:09.548 --> 02:11:14.161
MATT: I don't know, it's like last week ended with
a lot of tension. Enter it once; more than once

02:11:14.162 --> 02:11:18.726
you'll be disqualified, and unfortunately due to
giveaway rules, only people in the US and Canada

02:11:18.726 --> 02:11:23.372
excluding Quebec can enter. We'll have a winner
when we return, so see you guys here in a few minutes.

02:11:23.372 --> 02:11:24.622
TRAVIS: Damn!

02:11:24.622 --> 02:11:25.712
SAM: Wow!

02:11:25.712 --> 02:11:31.863
MATT: Welcome back. Before we jump back in, we
have a winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway.

02:11:31.866 --> 02:11:38.982
The winner tonight is palingratz. Palingratz,
congratulations! We'll get that sent to you ASAP,

02:11:39.412 --> 02:11:50.484
and we'll have our next giveaway next week. As you
all return back to the tavern where you're

02:11:50.484 --> 02:11:55.603
staying, the Goldfield Tavern and Lodge, you
gather your thoughts and yourselves in your

02:11:55.603 --> 02:11:57.837
respective chambers. What would you like to do?

02:11:57.845 --> 02:12:01.076
SAM: Shit, we should have talked about this during
the fucking break.

02:12:01.076 --> 02:12:05.020
TRAVIS: Nope, that would have been out of form
for us. No. We don't do that.

02:12:05.022 --> 02:12:06.374
SAM: What do we do?

02:12:06.881 --> 02:12:08.655
LIAM: We plan everything.

02:12:09.125 --> 02:12:10.284
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

02:12:10.765 --> 02:12:15.020
TALIESIN: I tried to get a sense if there was
something beyond that.

02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:18.119
I don't know, I got a hint of something.

02:12:18.177 --> 02:12:19.126
TRAVIS: You did?

02:12:19.126 --> 02:12:21.796
TALIESIN: I think maybe there's
something past that wall.

02:12:21.796 --> 02:12:26.516
SAM: Oh, in the tunnel? You're not talking about
my husband who I want to know if he's alive or not?

02:12:26.517 --> 02:12:32.664
TALIESIN: I can't know that until dawn. If we do
decide to go that direction, I think that there is

02:12:32.664 --> 02:12:37.114
definitely a chance that we could dig far enough
and deep enough to make passage.

02:12:39.069 --> 02:12:45.639
MARISHA: Guys. Hot take. The Kryn aren't the bad guys.

02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:57.586
SAM: That is a hot take. It's funny that you said
that because-- and it may have been because I was

02:12:57.586 --> 02:13:07.517
not drunk at the time. I was thinking, when you
were talking, Caleb, or Bren, about Rexxentrum

02:13:07.517 --> 02:13:13.534
and how it's heavily protected and guarded, and how
it's impossible to get in and make an assault

02:13:13.534 --> 02:13:21.074
on it, I immediately thought, well, what if we
went in with the Kryn and attacked with them?

02:13:22.919 --> 02:13:24.944
LIAM: To do...?

02:13:25.646 --> 02:13:30.570
TRAVIS: Are you talking about aligning ourselves
with the people that ganked your husband?

02:13:31.385 --> 02:13:39.014
SAM: I don't know that they've ganked him.
First of all, he might be dead.

02:13:39.596 --> 02:13:41.091
TALIESIN: We'll know tomorrow.

02:13:41.544 --> 02:13:45.834
SAM: He might be ganked, but he might not be
ganked by who we think ganked him.

02:13:46.119 --> 02:13:50.905
MARISHA: I mean, aside from the mind-altering
magic that we've already mentioned, all of us can

02:13:50.905 --> 02:13:57.110
change our appearance. Maybe what you're talking
about, about them coming in and using the crick,

02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:02.538
maybe that's what they did. Maybe they did your
exact suggestion first, and they disguised

02:14:02.538 --> 02:14:06.745
themselves to look like the Kryn and came in.
I don't know.

02:14:06.793 --> 02:14:08.753
SAM and MARISHA: So many unknowns!

02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:15.555
LIAM: I did not say that it is heavily fortified,
although I'm sure it is. It is the largest city

02:14:15.555 --> 02:14:25.210
in the empire. When I lived there-- and it was
only briefly when I was at school-- I could go

02:14:25.210 --> 02:14:29.287
anywhere in the city I wanted because
I'm a citizen of the empire.

02:14:30.558 --> 02:14:35.097
SAM: I assume it's a hard place to
attack or infiltrate.

02:14:35.586 --> 02:14:37.588
LIAM: The largest city in the empire?

02:14:37.947 --> 02:14:39.127
MARISHA: Rexxentrum.

02:14:39.826 --> 02:14:41.885
LIAM: That would be hard to attack.

02:14:43.171 --> 02:14:47.646
TRAVIS: Unless you could dig underground
with a bunch of pet worms.

02:14:48.392 --> 02:14:51.295
TALIESIN: Does make one wonder why they
haven't done that yet.

02:14:52.302 --> 02:14:54.490
TRAVIS: Maybe they're baby steps.

02:14:54.726 --> 02:14:58.802
MARISHA: Yeah. Doesn't feel like too many places
on the map are off limits.

02:14:59.103 --> 02:15:03.731
TRAVIS: Plus it'd be super nice if you could take
the most powerful city in the empire and slow it

02:15:03.731 --> 02:15:07.823
the fuck down before you attacked it.
That might work.

02:15:10.798 --> 02:15:12.621
TALIESIN: This is all very confusing.

02:15:13.942 --> 02:15:19.948
MARISHA: Speaking of, when I was talking to the
doctor, Demi, she said she had a few instances

02:15:19.948 --> 02:15:26.113
over the last month or so where people were coming
in feeling nauseous, feeling not like themselves

02:15:26.114 --> 02:15:30.726
in a grouped amount of time.
All from the cluster.

02:15:31.727 --> 02:15:34.629
TALIESIN: Do we want to poke this thing tonight,
or do we not?

02:15:34.702 --> 02:15:36.203
SAM: Poke the tunnel?

02:15:36.443 --> 02:15:41.557
TALIESIN: Not the tunnel. I mean--

02:15:41.557 --> 02:15:48.867
TRAVIS: We'll get to the tunnel. We need to get
her son out, and then we can decide.

02:15:48.867 --> 02:15:50.895
What thing were you talking about poking?

02:15:53.939 --> 02:16:03.499
TALIESIN: We have an object. We have another
object. Maybe we haven't really-- I mean, I doubt

02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:05.642
that we really understand what we have, but--

02:16:06.370 --> 02:16:09.769
MARISHA: You want to head towards Xhorhas,
is what you're saying.

02:16:09.770 --> 02:16:12.218
TALIESIN: I mean, we have these things right now.

02:16:12.218 --> 02:16:14.458
LAURA: Are you saying you want to look at them?

02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:15.570
TALIESIN: I kind of do.

02:16:15.570 --> 02:16:20.046
LAURA: Because Yussa said we shouldn't pull it
out. Especially right now, if people are looking

02:16:20.046 --> 02:16:22.760
for it, it could be really bad.

02:16:22.763 --> 02:16:23.808
TALIESIN: I suppose.

02:16:23.869 --> 02:16:27.827
MARISHA: That's the thing. You're talking about
poking that thing? The dodecahedron?

02:16:27.827 --> 02:16:29.920
TRAVIS: Yep. That's what he's talking about.

02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:30.661
MARISHA: No!

02:16:30.661 --> 02:16:31.501
SAM: To do what?

02:16:31.843 --> 02:16:36.139
TRAVIS: Because it's there to do.
Normally, all about that.

02:16:38.138 --> 02:16:42.713
LAURA: If Fjord is saying that is a bit--
then you know.

02:16:42.903 --> 02:16:45.631
TALIESIN: I'll follow the group, but--

02:16:45.811 --> 02:16:46.933
TRAVIS: Dragon sucked.

02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:56.144
TALIESIN: -- I'm here because where I was, I was
out of options. We've definitely found some

02:16:56.144 --> 02:17:00.280
options. I don't know what they mean yet, but
I went looking for them, and here we are.

02:17:00.462 --> 02:17:01.306
TRAVIS: I agree.

02:17:01.445 --> 02:17:06.598
MARISHA: Caleb-- sorry, Caduceus. Freudian slip.

02:17:08.804 --> 02:17:10.965
TRAVIS: Carl. Kevin. Keep going.

02:17:11.117 --> 02:17:11.916
LAURA: Brent.

02:17:12.837 --> 02:17:13.537
MATT: Jeff.

02:17:13.617 --> 02:17:14.826
TRAVIS: It's a "K" sound.

02:17:16.858 --> 02:17:22.657
MARISHA: You said the life force was being sucked
away from your grave, from your home.

02:17:24.047 --> 02:17:31.587
TALIESIN: That's right. Has been for a while. The
forest that surrounds it, the corrupted forest, is

02:17:32.228 --> 02:17:40.387
overtaking it as if the magic that held it in
place is being supplanted. I'm of the opinion that

02:17:40.387 --> 02:17:53.117
that shouldn't be happening. There are several
other-- we're not the only site like our own.

02:17:53.807 --> 02:17:59.307
We haven't had much communication with the other
sites, so I don't know if it's happening anywhere else.

02:17:59.307 --> 02:18:01.487
LAURA: Do you want me to send them a message?

02:18:01.487 --> 02:18:09.117
TALIESIN: I wouldn't even know who to send it to.
We're supposed to protect that place,

02:18:09.117 --> 02:18:11.186
and I was running out of ideas.

02:18:11.406 --> 02:18:12.457
TRAVIS: You said we.

02:18:12.537 --> 02:18:13.556
TALIESIN: My family.

02:18:13.896 --> 02:18:16.299
TRAVIS: How many of them are there?

02:18:16.867 --> 02:18:24.948
TALIESIN: Oh, lots. I mean, depending on when and
where. Members of my family and others have been

02:18:24.948 --> 02:18:33.718
protecting that place for as long as it has
existed. We built the temple. We founded it.

02:18:33.778 --> 02:18:35.675
LAURA: Your family's still there now?

02:18:36.599 --> 02:18:43.808
TALIESIN: No, they all left.

02:18:44.557 --> 02:18:48.198
MARISHA: You said also to look for answers,
though, right? They left first?

02:18:48.297 --> 02:18:51.196
TALIESIN: Yeah, and none of them have come back.

02:18:52.358 --> 02:18:55.209
MARISHA: You have any idea which direction
they were heading?

02:18:57.887 --> 02:18:58.891
TALIESIN: Not really.

02:18:58.892 --> 02:19:03.413
MARISHA: You can speak to the Wildmother. You've
checked in on a few of our friends. Do you ever

02:19:03.413 --> 02:19:06.441
check in on them, see what the Wildmother tells you?

02:19:08.071 --> 02:19:15.121
TALIESIN: I feel like she would let me know if I
needed to know. That's not an answer I really want

02:19:15.121 --> 02:19:21.872
the-- that's not an answer I'm looking for
right now. I'm sure you understand.

02:19:21.989 --> 02:19:22.853
MARISHA: I do.

02:19:23.255 --> 02:19:33.543
TALIESIN: Best to have faith and not second guess
how she's decided to move forward. If I recall,

02:19:35.383 --> 02:19:45.120
Corin talked about trying to find some of the
other temples, but I don't know. No one's come

02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:52.612
back. When you came around, I had an inkling that
it was supposed to be my job to do this from the

02:19:52.612 --> 02:19:59.582
beginning and that I had been shirking my duties.
You all seemed like a very good sign that

02:19:59.582 --> 02:20:04.239
it was time to take some responsibility.

02:20:06.352 --> 02:20:08.082
SAM: What was your name before this?

02:20:08.211 --> 02:20:11.651
(laughter)

02:20:11.991 --> 02:20:14.083
TALIESIN: Those who knew me called me Geoff.

02:20:14.093 --> 02:20:18.601
(laughter)

02:20:19.233 --> 02:20:20.612
LAURA: It's such a good name!

02:20:20.682 --> 02:20:23.012
TALIESIN: It's a good name. Spelled it with a
"G."

02:20:23.082 --> 02:20:24.410
MARISHA: It's a great name.

02:20:25.173 --> 02:20:26.841
TALIESIN: I've got nothing to hide.

02:20:26.841 --> 02:20:29.300
MARISHA: Geoff with a "G" or Jeff with a "J"?

02:20:29.301 --> 02:20:31.634
TALIESIN: "G". What's wrong with you? Don't
even--

02:20:31.634 --> 02:20:32.591
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

02:20:32.591 --> 02:20:35.631
SAM: Can we go to sleep so we can find out
if my husband's alive?

02:20:35.632 --> 02:20:36.607
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah!

02:20:36.637 --> 02:20:41.448
TALIESIN: Now I have anxiety. I may not sleep tonight,
now. It's a lot of pressure to put on a person.

02:20:41.902 --> 02:20:44.427
TRAVIS: Herbal tea, some melatonin, something, right?

02:20:44.446 --> 02:20:47.732
TALIESIN: Oh, this is caffeinated.
I'm going to be up all night. Yeah.

02:20:51.792 --> 02:20:53.717
MARISHA: Jester, you okay?

02:20:54.428 --> 02:20:55.132
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:57.945 --> 02:20:59.004
MARISHA: What's wrong?

02:20:59.108 --> 02:21:14.717
LAURA: It's a little overwhelming. I mean, this is
some serious shit. I mean, I came from Nicodranas,

02:21:14.717 --> 02:21:24.856
and everything was nice. The empire is really
fucked up. Everybody went through such

02:21:24.857 --> 02:21:36.366
horrible things, and I'm really sorry for
everyone. That's all.

02:21:38.067 --> 02:21:45.738
SAM: Thank you. I promise you, if you stay with
us, you will also go through some horrible,

02:21:45.738 --> 02:21:46.788
horrible things.

02:21:47.387 --> 02:21:49.955
LAURA: Don't worry, Nott. I already have.

02:21:50.296 --> 02:21:51.147
SAM: Oh, good.

02:21:52.307 --> 02:21:58.016
LAURA: I'm sure there is worse to come.
We'll get through it, though.

02:21:58.615 --> 02:22:03.819
MARISHA: I mean, nice is boring after a while.

02:22:05.267 --> 02:22:06.239
LAURA: Yeah.

02:22:06.262 --> 02:22:10.694
MARISHA: We can get to nice. Right? Eh.

02:22:14.224 --> 02:22:18.243
LAURA: I would like nice again at some point.

02:22:21.841 --> 02:22:28.450
TALIESIN: I just want home back. I want to know
that it's safe again.

02:22:31.327 --> 02:22:38.855
MARISHA: I'm sure there's some beachfront property
open in Nicodranas. Maybe, if we work really hard

02:22:38.855 --> 02:22:41.538
and pool our funds, we can retire.

02:22:43.548 --> 02:22:44.302
LAURA: Yeah.

02:22:46.883 --> 02:22:49.059
TALIESIN: You're always welcome where I live.

02:22:52.986 --> 02:22:56.434
SAM: I'm like nine, so I don't know about retiring yet.

02:22:58.833 --> 02:23:01.592
LAURA: Do you want to be a halfling again?

02:23:03.133 --> 02:23:13.877
SAM: I want to be me again, yes. Yes.
I hope that someday it can happen.

02:23:14.954 --> 02:23:17.554
LAURA: We should talk to Yussa.
Maybe he can help you.

02:23:17.803 --> 02:23:22.683
SAM: That's true. He's a very powerful wizard.
That would be nice.

02:23:24.284 --> 02:23:27.814
MARISHA: You didn't get turned into all
the things that you're afraid you are.

02:23:28.223 --> 02:23:32.740
It's not how this shit works.

02:23:36.283 --> 02:23:38.425
SAM: Well, I guess it remains to be seen.

02:23:39.531 --> 02:23:44.878
LAURA: You're still pretty cool. I mean, the
coolest goblin I've ever known.

02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:54.452
SAM: Yeah, I suppose. That one in Nicodranas was
pretty cool, though. He had slicked-back hair--

02:23:54.452 --> 02:23:57.218
LAURA: Yeah, he was wearing pretty fancy clothes
and stuff.

02:23:57.408 --> 02:24:00.168
MARISHA: Do you want us to still call you Nott?

02:24:02.498 --> 02:24:06.574
LAURA: Or Veth? Or Vott?

02:24:07.524 --> 02:24:22.473
SAM: Wow, that's weird. Let's stick with Nott
for now. When I'm back again, I'll change it.

02:24:27.357 --> 02:24:28.834
MARISHA: Nott and Caleb it is.

02:24:30.984 --> 02:24:33.272
TALIESIN: Until you're ready for something else.

02:24:33.537 --> 02:24:34.417
SAM: Absolutely.

02:24:35.339 --> 02:24:39.654
MARISHA: The Mighty Nein. Made of seven people.
Works great.

02:24:39.654 --> 02:24:40.842
SAM: Nothing makes sense.

02:24:40.842 --> 02:24:41.566
MARISHA: Nope.

02:24:43.067 --> 02:24:47.866
LIAM: Not the name. Not the group. None of it.

02:24:50.614 --> 02:24:52.095
TRAVIS: Well, I'm going to bed.

02:24:52.095 --> 02:24:54.594
LIAM: (sad trombone)

02:24:56.815 --> 02:24:59.515
SAM: That was as Caleb, in canon.

02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:02.286
(laughter)

02:25:02.332 --> 02:25:03.202
TRAVIS: You sang!

02:25:05.246 --> 02:25:08.108
MATT: Weirdest use of Prestidigitation
I've ever seen.

02:25:10.148 --> 02:25:11.738
LIAM: Little floating trombones.

02:25:15.513 --> 02:25:18.773
MATT: Mysterious Merrie Melodies like (whoomp).

02:25:19.207 --> 02:25:23.308
LIAM: (sad trombone)

02:25:23.371 --> 02:25:26.401
MATT: You guys get an evening's rest in
your respective rooms.

02:25:26.658 --> 02:25:31.914
The morning greets you with the smell of food
being prepared as you head downstairs.

02:25:31.917 --> 02:25:37.223
As all of you and two other patrons
that are couple of other farmhands--

02:25:37.223 --> 02:25:38.956
TRAVIS: What do they look like?

02:25:39.129 --> 02:25:40.676
MATT: They look like farmhands.

02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:42.650
TALIESIN: What is their real name?

02:25:44.115 --> 02:25:45.645
LAURA: What are they sitting on?

02:25:45.666 --> 02:25:50.336
MATT: Their names are Chair.
Together, they are... Chair.

02:25:50.336 --> 02:25:52.483
SAM and LAURA: (whispering) Chair'otoa.

02:25:52.483 --> 02:25:53.532
MATT: You're a chair.

02:25:53.543 --> 02:25:56.689
TALIESIN: You've been lying.
You don't even have a leg to stand on.

02:25:56.689 --> 02:26:00.526
(groaning)

02:26:00.527 --> 02:26:01.689
TRAVIS: Leave the table.

02:26:04.448 --> 02:26:07.369
SAM: When everyone's serious,
Taliesin is the comic relief.

02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:11.248
TALIESIN: Here to bring the awkward.

02:26:11.375 --> 02:26:18.843
MATT: Good, I love it. You have your meal.
The day is yours. What do you wish to do?

02:26:18.919 --> 02:26:27.423
TALIESIN: I'm going to find an appropriate spot:
somewhere quiet, somewhere with a view, somewhere

02:26:27.423 --> 02:26:30.465
where the Wildmother's work is well at hand.

02:26:31.305 --> 02:26:41.307
MATT: Okay. That would be probably either on the
Tillage itself or some of the small grove clusters

02:26:41.307 --> 02:26:46.815
along the river that you guys were talking
earlier. I assume you're casting Divination?

02:26:46.815 --> 02:26:47.686
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:26:47.699 --> 02:26:54.435
MATT: A reminder, it is a specific question
concerning a goal, event, or activity to occur

02:26:54.435 --> 02:26:55.622
within seven days.

02:26:55.785 --> 02:26:57.676
LIAM: (whispering) Ask about the chair.

02:26:57.842 --> 02:26:59.623
TALIESIN: You've entirely thrown me.

02:26:59.623 --> 02:27:02.007
MARISHA: (whispering) Was the chair made by Geoff?

02:27:02.008 --> 02:27:07.105
MATT: Whatever you're trying to ascertain, it
needs to be involving a specific goal, an event,

02:27:07.105 --> 02:27:09.529
or activity within the next seven days.

02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:15.641
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going to basically go for
the same thing I did last time, if that still suits.

02:27:15.641 --> 02:27:19.390
Unless you would like me to shift a little bit,
for your own--

02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:28.497
MATT: I let it go a little bit last time, only
because it was a question of what were they

02:27:28.497 --> 02:27:34.120
doing right now. It's like, well, that's an
activity that they were doing, I guess.

02:27:35.615 --> 02:27:38.138
Choose your words carefully, is all I'm saying.

02:27:38.504 --> 02:27:40.533
TALIESIN: A goal? Hmm.

02:27:40.759 --> 02:27:45.874
MATT: An event, or an activity. I mean,
that's a broad spectrum, so be specific.

02:27:45.988 --> 02:27:49.190
TALIESIN: Yessa. I want to make sure I'm
getting the name right, right?

02:27:50.128 --> 02:27:52.882
SAM: Yeza Brenatto.

02:27:53.596 --> 02:28:11.052
TALIESIN: Yeza. I sit, make my circle. What is
Yeza's destination? Pushing a few days forward.

02:28:12.501 --> 02:28:17.782
MATT: You close your eyes and concentrate.
It's a beautiful morning, actually.

02:28:17.789 --> 02:28:25.948
It's a chilly morning, but this far enough south
in the empire, hasn't hit snow yet. The full

02:28:25.948 --> 02:28:31.392
winter hasn't come into effect, so it's still
green fields and mostly blue sky with bits of

02:28:31.393 --> 02:28:43.371
clouds. As you concentrate, the chilled wind
picks up a little bit. Across the wind, it begins

02:28:43.371 --> 02:28:52.621
to form words through your ears.
(wind blowing) (whispering) "Ghor Dranas."

02:28:52.621 --> 02:28:53.713
TALIESIN: Ghor Dranas.

02:28:53.785 --> 02:28:54.537
SAM: What?

02:28:55.333 --> 02:28:58.021
LIAM: Ghor Dranas. Xhorhas.

02:29:02.871 --> 02:29:04.251
TRAVIS: (whispering) What?

02:29:05.181 --> 02:29:07.715
MARISHA: (whispering) Something Dranas. Ghor Dranas.

02:29:08.621 --> 02:29:10.150
TALIESIN: That's all I have.

02:29:11.649 --> 02:29:15.426
SAM: We've heard that before. That's in Xhorhas.

02:29:15.426 --> 02:29:16.704
LAURA: Yeah. It's in here.

02:29:16.845 --> 02:29:22.803
SAM: Yes, it's in there. The cricks took him.
Does that mean he's alive?

02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:24.819
TALIESIN: Probably.

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:30.824
SAM: Thank you, Caduceus.

02:29:31.359 --> 02:29:33.128
LAURA: Citadel! They have a citadel.

02:29:33.128 --> 02:29:35.412
TALIESIN: Seems silly to move someone who isn't.

02:29:36.304 --> 02:29:40.398
MATT: Anyone here who's proficient in history,
make a history check, if you don't mind.

02:29:41.291 --> 02:29:42.083
MARISHA: I am.

02:29:42.949 --> 02:29:47.122
SAM: How's Yasha? Because she's been to
fucking Xhorhas before.

02:29:47.122 --> 02:29:48.142
LAURA: That's right.

02:29:48.354 --> 02:29:51.897
MARISHA: Yeah, I know. What's Yasha up to?

02:29:53.058 --> 02:29:54.568
MATT: Yasha's with you guys.

02:29:54.628 --> 02:29:56.769
SAM: Does she know anything about this place?

02:29:57.231 --> 02:30:03.107
LIAM: I also had notes, and I read a book at the
Cobalt Soul about Xhorhas. I have all that.

02:30:03.336 --> 02:30:04.589
MATT: What did you roll?

02:30:04.648 --> 02:30:05.439
LIAM: Oh, 17.

02:30:05.727 --> 02:30:06.716
MARISHA: 19.

02:30:06.728 --> 02:30:12.847
MATT: I'm seeing how much detail you get.
19, good! Yasha first pipes in and goes,

02:30:13.321 --> 02:30:25.897
"Well, I've heard the name. It's far further north
than where I lived, and we avoided it because

02:30:29.947 --> 02:30:33.107
"a lot of the beast folk live that way."

02:30:34.124 --> 02:30:35.869
LIAM: Beast folk. What do you mean?

02:30:36.919 --> 02:30:51.751
MATT: "Meaning the others who wander the wastes.
There are men who are like bull warriors as well,

02:30:51.751 --> 02:31:09.785
"and bugbears, and other goblinoids. Some are wild
and angry and hungry, and we had to protect or

02:31:09.786 --> 02:31:24.567
"raid them first. Others, they work with the Kryn.
That's farther north, but I've not been there."

02:31:25.081 --> 02:31:28.936
LIAM: Have you ever heard of something called the Luxon?

02:31:31.130 --> 02:31:32.268
MATT: "I have not."

02:31:33.873 --> 02:31:36.134
SAM: What is that? What's Deluxin'?

02:31:36.328 --> 02:31:38.281
LIAM: The Luxon.

02:31:39.064 --> 02:31:40.575
LAURA: It's a casino.

02:31:41.013 --> 02:31:42.314
SAM: No, it is not.

02:31:45.135 --> 02:31:54.885
LIAM: I'm not sure. I read about them, or it. I
don't what it is. Something that is having some

02:31:54.885 --> 02:31:57.524
sort of negative effect on the people of
Ghor Dranas.

02:31:58.303 --> 02:32:00.307
MARISHA: Would I know anything about that?

02:32:01.486 --> 02:32:07.164
MATT: No, you would not. But with the history
checks you guys did pull on Ghor Dranas,

02:32:07.164 --> 02:32:18.623
Ghor Dranas is important to the history of the
Age of Arcanum. When the gods walked the earth,

02:32:18.624 --> 02:32:24.235
both Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods, there
were various areas that were considered their

02:32:24.235 --> 02:32:30.355
realm of influence on the mortal plane, outside
of their home realms in the different inner and

02:32:30.355 --> 02:32:38.045
outer planes. A number of these citadels of the
Betrayer Gods were concentrated around Xhorhas

02:32:38.045 --> 02:32:43.774
and the surrounding landscape. That's where the
most intense battles took place of the Calamity,

02:32:43.774 --> 02:32:59.174
was on Wildemount. Ghor Dranas was the name of
the center of their tenuous union. Essentially, in

02:32:59.174 --> 02:33:10.864
the final years of the Calamity, it was where all
of the Betrayer Gods would go to plot the undoing

02:33:10.864 --> 02:33:24.529
of the rest of the free people and their creators
in Exandria. What remains of Ghor Dranas is where

02:33:24.529 --> 02:33:33.666
the Kryn have established their empire, their dynasty.
It's essentially the capital city of the Kryn dynasty.

02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:38.952
MARISHA: What was it that those letters
were saying was under Ghor Dranas?

02:33:38.952 --> 02:33:40.469
Or they were looking for things?

02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:46.912
LAURA: No, that wasn't it. They were saying that
they couldn't believe that Ghor Dranas was holding

02:33:46.912 --> 02:33:51.743
secrets, like that they had a whole other school
of magic that we haven't discovered here.

02:33:52.083 --> 02:33:58.479
LIAM: This, everything we've been talking about.
It says in there that they control fate and time.

02:33:59.010 --> 02:34:09.358
MATT: Yasha pipes up and says, "From all that
I know, people in my clan saying that

02:34:09.358 --> 02:34:13.416
"that area up north is perpetual night."

02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:16.969
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, I have read this. All around Ghor Dranas.

02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:18.841
MATT: "From what I hear, yes."

02:34:18.841 --> 02:34:19.566
LAURA: Wow.

02:34:23.911 --> 02:34:27.447
LIAM: An empress runs it named Leylas Kryn.

02:34:28.350 --> 02:34:30.608
LAURA: Yeah, I remember hearing about her.

02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:39.654
TALIESIN: We may get lucky if we go into the
tunnel. They may still be preparing at some point

02:34:39.654 --> 02:34:42.517
to head in that direction. They're not there yet.

02:34:44.318 --> 02:34:45.953
LAURA: We could go after them.

02:34:48.393 --> 02:34:50.531
SAM: We're talking about hundreds of miles.

02:34:50.692 --> 02:34:57.401
TALIESIN: They haven't made it that far yet, though.
It's where they will be, not where they are.

02:34:59.801 --> 02:35:07.319
MATT: As a note, just to remind you, if you're
thinking of distances and times. The attack

02:35:07.319 --> 02:35:14.871
transpired weeks ago, so you're not right on their
tail. Consider that in what you're planning.

02:35:14.871 --> 02:35:16.189
TRAVIS: They fucking out.

02:35:17.399 --> 02:35:20.561
MATT: Mind you, your options are your options.

02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:22.876
TALIESIN: The north is looking interesting.

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:27.631
MATT: There are many possibilities here. Many.

02:35:28.171 --> 02:35:32.220
LIAM: We are focusing on your fellow.

02:35:32.983 --> 02:35:37.219
SAM: Well yes, if that's all right with you.
I don't want to drag you all to the center of

02:35:37.859 --> 02:35:45.060
Xhorhas, where the beasts live, and the capital
city where the empress is. It seems like,

02:35:46.151 --> 02:35:52.536
if we go to Rexxentrum, we're in deep trouble.
If we go to Xhorhas, we're in even worse trouble.

02:35:52.561 --> 02:35:55.746
TALIESIN: I think trouble's going to close up
on us, no matter what.

02:35:55.774 --> 02:35:58.332
LIAM: There are beasts in the north,
but Yeza is not.

02:35:58.861 --> 02:36:01.001
TRAVIS: I mean, what else are we going to do?

02:36:01.026 --> 02:36:06.732
MARISHA: I oddly feel more comfortable going to
Ghor Dranas than I do going to Rexxentrum.

02:36:06.738 --> 02:36:08.691
TALIESIN: I feel like it might be a sign.

02:36:08.691 --> 02:36:12.591
SAM: (huffs) How do we get there? I mean,
are we really going to go through tunnels

02:36:12.591 --> 02:36:14.115
for several weeks until we get--

02:36:14.116 --> 02:36:18.761
TALIESIN: We've got a cart. I'm not even kidding a bit.

02:36:20.021 --> 02:36:21.283
TRAVIS: Maybe, maybe not.

02:36:21.453 --> 02:36:25.200
LAURA: We take our cart, and we head straight
toward the worst of the war.

02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:26.677
Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

02:36:26.678 --> 02:36:31.258
SAM: Then when we get there, what do we say? Hey
everybody, we're here in town to sell our wares!

02:36:31.258 --> 02:36:35.979
TRAVIS: We don't even know if the tunnels are
accessible to us. Why don't we see if they are, first?

02:36:35.979 --> 02:36:40.938
TALIESIN: I'll also say, it's not the worst of the
war right now, is Ghor Dranas? That's past it.

02:36:40.949 --> 02:36:48.258
MATT: You don't quite know where Ghor Dranas is.
You know it's east. Right now, the war is right here.

02:36:48.999 --> 02:36:56.588
These are the garrisons. Put that in the center,
there. By the Brokenveil Bluffs, these are

02:36:56.588 --> 02:37:01.719
where the two, the Ashguard and Rockguard
Garrisons are. One of the garrisons has been lost

02:37:01.719 --> 02:37:09.329
to the Kryn, and they are currently holding it at
the border. Bladegarden, right there, is the

02:37:09.329 --> 02:37:15.429
foremost front of the military now. The conflict
right now is being held-- from what you've heard

02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:22.530
so far. Your information is dicey at best because
you've been gone for a while. The last you know,

02:37:22.530 --> 02:37:26.108
this is where the focus of the conflict is.
There you go.

02:37:26.749 --> 02:37:28.670
LIAM: Gentlemen, we can't fight in here.

02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:30.009
TALIESIN: It's the war room.

02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:37.789
SAM: If we go over land, we'll be going right
through the front of the war. If we go under land,

02:37:37.789 --> 02:37:41.091
we'll be underground for &lt;i&gt;weeks&lt;/i&gt;.

02:37:41.091 --> 02:37:45.996
TALIESIN: Also, in tunnels built for war. That's
the thing. There's no fighting the war.

02:37:46.118 --> 02:37:49.880
MARISHA: I agree with what one of you said.

02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:53.299
TRAVIS: It was probably me. I'm very wise and agreeable.

02:37:53.299 --> 02:37:59.258
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. That once we get there, we're
fucking nobodies. What are we going to do?

02:37:59.839 --> 02:38:02.597
LAURA: Yeah, we can't fight an entire army.

02:38:02.767 --> 02:38:07.019
TALIESIN: We don't have to. That's the thing.

02:38:07.189 --> 02:38:12.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, we took that wrong turn at
Albuquerque, right? We'll get back and

02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:14.021
skedaddle out of there if we have to.

02:38:14.939 --> 02:38:21.340
LAURA: Want me to send him a message? What if I'm
like: Hey dude. Do you think that you're going to

02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:23.060
be able to escape or something?

02:38:23.065 --> 02:38:27.199
TRAVIS: Yeah, weren't we more concerned about that
when we thought he was in Rexxentrum?

02:38:27.199 --> 02:38:28.114
LAURA: Oh boy.

02:38:30.624 --> 02:38:35.461
SAM: If you did send him a message, I would urge
you to do something hopeful.

02:38:36.331 --> 02:38:38.589
LAURA: Like what? What do you want me to say?

02:38:40.987 --> 02:38:43.395
SAM: Stay alive, and we'll try to find you.

02:38:44.023 --> 02:38:45.472
LAURA: Describe him to me.

02:38:47.394 --> 02:39:05.818
SAM: Well, he is short, even for halflings, and he
has bushy brown hair, long sideburns.

02:39:05.819 --> 02:39:09.781
I always tell him to cut them, but he always
keeps them long. He likes them long.

02:39:09.781 --> 02:39:12.269
LIAM: Nott, can you make yourself look like him?

02:39:12.874 --> 02:39:14.175
LAURA: Oh, that'll work.

02:39:14.528 --> 02:39:22.430
SAM: Oh. Sure, yes, I can. I will Disguise Self.

02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:28.886
MATT: You get a very clear image of the last
memory that Nott has of Yeza.

02:39:29.281 --> 02:39:44.705
SAM: Big nose, not a great chin, bushy dark hair,
long sideburns, sort of narrow shoulders.

02:39:45.176 --> 02:39:46.872
(whispering) Not a looker--

02:39:46.949 --> 02:39:49.832
LAURA: I can see what you saw in him.

02:39:49.902 --> 02:39:51.206
SAM: But he is to me.

02:39:52.866 --> 02:39:55.232
LIAM: He seems like an interesting fellow.

02:39:56.584 --> 02:39:58.820
SAM: He was wonderful.

02:39:59.406 --> 02:40:03.255
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and LAURA: Is.

02:40:04.296 --> 02:40:05.171
SAM: Is.

02:40:07.121 --> 02:40:09.261
MARISHA: How long have you two been married?

02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:17.369
SAM: Do you count the time that I was dead
and a goblin?

02:40:17.489 --> 02:40:18.730
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yes.

02:40:20.456 --> 02:40:22.141
SAM: Because I lost my ring.

02:40:22.364 --> 02:40:24.854
TALIESIN: It's really not about that, though, is it?

02:40:24.943 --> 02:40:29.914
LIAM: That's a symbol. The person's
more important.

02:40:30.345 --> 02:40:39.854
SAM: Five years, then. Married young.

02:40:40.501 --> 02:40:44.094
MARISHA: (stuttering) Happy anniversary. Right?

02:40:44.203 --> 02:40:45.125
SAM: Thank you.

02:40:47.173 --> 02:40:48.564
TRAVIS: Why did you say that?

02:40:48.915 --> 02:40:50.781
MARISHA: That's what people say, right?

02:40:50.996 --> 02:40:56.092
TRAVIS: Usually on the anniversary of when they
were married. Not just like, you're married!

02:40:56.092 --> 02:40:57.455
Happy anniversary!

02:40:59.407 --> 02:41:00.966
MARISHA: Congratulations?

02:41:00.966 --> 02:41:02.737
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. Better. Yep.

02:41:02.839 --> 02:41:05.745
LIAM: So we have to come up with a plan
for what we are doing.

02:41:05.745 --> 02:41:07.544
SAM: For sure, we do.

02:41:08.675 --> 02:41:18.018
LIAM: Rexxentrum is its own set of problems and
dangers. Your husband is heading towards Xhorhas

02:41:18.018 --> 02:41:23.725
and a war. I am not feeling very optimistic about
the tunnels, but I have been wrong about many

02:41:23.725 --> 02:41:28.114
things. So why don't we check out the tunnels?
Let's do something positive.

02:41:29.342 --> 02:41:31.087
TRAVIS: Let's get your son out.

02:41:32.256 --> 02:41:36.931
TALIESIN: I'm also, I will admit, not feeling very
positive about the tunnels. But we should take a

02:41:36.931 --> 02:41:40.022
look because the other option is the cart.

02:41:40.112 --> 02:41:42.065
TRAVIS: Let's go. Son. Let's get started.

02:41:42.065 --> 02:41:46.588
SAM: We're going to Luke first, to the son?
Sending him on a wagon or something?

02:41:46.641 --> 02:41:49.257
TALIESIN: I believe you gave them quite a bit
of money.

02:41:49.314 --> 02:41:55.423
SAM: Sure, but we still have to tell them where to
go and when to go. We'll go there.

02:41:55.423 --> 02:41:58.409
LIAM: Should we hire someone to go with them
as muscle?

02:41:58.410 --> 02:42:00.727
SAM: Yes! Absolutely.

02:42:00.727 --> 02:42:06.239
TALIESIN: There's probably people coming and going
on most of these roads who are used to

02:42:06.239 --> 02:42:07.689
moving people across.

02:42:07.798 --> 02:42:10.802
SAM: Was there a Jeff fellow? He's a fighter?

02:42:10.803 --> 02:42:15.528
MARISHA: He's a little worse for wear, but he said
he had a few friends that fared out okay that are

02:42:15.528 --> 02:42:18.789
still around. I could ask him for a recommendation.

02:42:19.799 --> 02:42:28.674
SAM: Okay. Well, let's go talk to Edith first, I
guess. Ask her if she wants to leave.

02:42:29.783 --> 02:42:33.251
LAURA: While we're going, I'm going to try and
send a message to Yeza.

02:42:33.535 --> 02:42:36.133
MATT: Okay. What message do you send?

02:42:40.503 --> 02:42:50.809
LAURA: I'm a friend of Veth. We know you've been
taken, but stay hopeful; we're looking for you.

02:42:51.849 --> 02:42:56.469
If you can, tell us where you are currently.

02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:22.294
MATT: There's no response, and then a very faint
one. "Hello? I don't know. It's very dark.

02:43:25.521 --> 02:43:34.001
"I have to be quiet, but thank you." That's it.

02:43:39.301 --> 02:43:50.753
LAURA: Nott, he's alive! He said it's dark and he
has to stay quiet, but thank you.

02:43:54.416 --> 02:44:00.475
SAM: (sighs) Good. That means I didn't lie to my son.

02:44:03.777 --> 02:44:05.032
LAURA: We'll find him.

02:44:08.016 --> 02:44:21.046
SAM: I believe it. Yes. All right, let's go
to Edith.

02:44:21.046 --> 02:44:22.541
LIAM: Take care of your family.

02:44:22.542 --> 02:44:23.775
SAM: Yes, yes!

02:44:26.426 --> 02:44:29.093
MATT: Do you change your form, or do you
show up as Yeza?

02:44:29.093 --> 02:44:32.132
SAM: I mean, we talked about someone else
going over there.

02:44:36.473 --> 02:44:38.208
TALIESIN: Scarred for life!

02:44:38.282 --> 02:44:41.308
TRAVIS: Everything's fine! Just going
to the beach for a bit.

02:44:41.724 --> 02:44:46.361
MARISHA: Yeah, don't show up as his dad and ship
him away. It doesn't work out well, I promise.

02:44:49.261 --> 02:44:51.791
SAM: I don't know. How do we convey this message?

02:44:51.885 --> 02:44:52.989
TRAVIS: It's up to you.

02:44:53.049 --> 02:44:53.915
SAM: (sighs)

02:44:53.980 --> 02:44:55.013
LAURA: Want me to go?

02:44:55.013 --> 02:44:57.062
TALIESIN: You're good with kids, I imagine.

02:44:58.697 --> 02:45:00.524
LAURA: Kids really like me.

02:45:00.675 --> 02:45:03.235
SAM: Everyone likes you. You're lovable.

02:45:03.833 --> 02:45:04.896
LAURA: Thanks, Nott.

02:45:04.896 --> 02:45:06.436
SAM: Don't you think so, Fjord?

02:45:07.138 --> 02:45:07.965
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:45:09.361 --> 02:45:10.531
SAM: But like, really?

02:45:10.609 --> 02:45:11.412
LAURA: Stop it.

02:45:11.412 --> 02:45:12.160
SAM: Okay.

02:45:14.572 --> 02:45:16.300
LIAM: That's two "stop it"s tonight.

02:45:24.811 --> 02:45:30.143
LAURA: Yeah, there it is. I should go find Old
Edith and I'm going to say what?

02:45:30.460 --> 02:45:37.021
SAM: You're going to say: I have a message from
Veth. She wants you to go far away, where it's

02:45:37.021 --> 02:45:43.289
safe, to Alfield. Use the money she gave you.
Men will be here tomorrow to escort you.

02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:44.770
LAURA: There's men coming too?

02:45:44.770 --> 02:45:47.060
SAM: We're going to hire somebody, I don't know.

02:45:47.061 --> 02:45:48.641
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:50.601
SAM: Jeff's friend.

02:45:52.791 --> 02:45:54.751
LAURA: I'll go find Old Edith.

02:45:55.391 --> 02:45:58.152
MATT: You find your way to the exterior
of Edith's house.

02:45:58.152 --> 02:46:00.693
MARISHA: Geoffman and Geoffrey. Geoff's friends.

02:46:04.515 --> 02:46:08.103
MATT: A few moments pass, a door opens.
"Hi, can I help you?"

02:46:08.103 --> 02:46:09.094
LAURA: Hi, Edith?

02:46:09.094 --> 02:46:09.801
MATT: "Yes."

02:46:09.801 --> 02:46:10.510
LAURA: Hello.

02:46:10.510 --> 02:46:11.211
MATT: "Hello."

02:46:11.212 --> 02:46:17.937
LAURA: You may remember me from the other night.
I was outside? I'm a friend of Veth.

02:46:17.937 --> 02:46:20.444
MATT: "Right, yes. Can I help you?"

02:46:20.594 --> 02:46:26.196
LAURA: Yes. She, of course, had to be on her way
because things are hard right now,

02:46:26.196 --> 02:46:34.118
but she wanted to convey her desire for you
and Lucas-- Lucas?

02:46:34.118 --> 02:46:34.842
TRAVIS: Luke.

02:46:34.842 --> 02:46:39.873
LAURA: -- Luke to find your way to Alfield.

02:46:40.384 --> 02:46:42.500
MATT: "Why are we heading to Alfield?"

02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:50.683
LAURA: Because she doesn't think it is safe for
you to be here right now. Now, Alfield is very

02:46:50.683 --> 02:46:57.519
safe and there's a wonderful person there named
Bryce, who we've already sent word to because

02:46:57.519 --> 02:47:04.358
we're pretty powerful, and they'll be expecting you.
She said to use the money that she gave you

02:47:04.358 --> 02:47:12.629
to head there and get a place to stay and use it
for food. Buy yourself something nice, you know?

02:47:12.749 --> 02:47:15.815
MATT: "Oh, okay. How long are we supposed to be
staying?"

02:47:16.005 --> 02:47:21.783
LAURA: As long as it takes, because it's pretty
dangerous still, but we will be able to send word

02:47:21.783 --> 02:47:24.925
to you and let you know when it's safe to come
home, which is good!

02:47:24.925 --> 02:47:25.924
MATT: "Okay."

02:47:25.924 --> 02:47:31.425
LAURA: You should get your stuff together, because
tomorrow somebody will be here to escort you

02:47:31.425 --> 02:47:32.369
to the city.

02:47:32.769 --> 02:47:34.091
MATT: "Oh, that's nice."

02:47:34.091 --> 02:47:38.356
LAURA: Yeah. Is there anything else I can do
for you, Edith?

02:47:38.677 --> 02:47:40.558
TRAVIS: Best customer service ever.

02:47:40.558 --> 02:47:41.336
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:47:44.276 --> 02:47:55.970
MATT: "Does Alfield-- do they have-- I've never
been to Alfield, so I'm just wondering--

02:48:02.101 --> 02:48:05.105
"never mind." She turns around.

02:48:05.105 --> 02:48:09.545
LAURA: Okay. Bryce will be looking for you!

02:48:09.545 --> 02:48:14.544
MATT: "Bryce, got it!" She turns back to you
and goes, "Thank you."

02:48:14.784 --> 02:48:19.582
LAURA: Oh, you're welcome. Have a wonderful day.

02:48:20.572 --> 02:48:21.545
MATT: "You too!"

02:48:22.207 --> 02:48:27.205
SAM: (like Jester) Would you like to take a survey
and tell me how my service was?

02:48:28.222 --> 02:48:30.700
LAURA: It will only take five minutes of your time!

02:48:31.450 --> 02:48:33.953
MARISHA: Is it okay that I recorded our
conversation?

02:48:33.972 --> 02:48:38.263
TRAVIS: (like Jester) You need to hang up because
I can't technically hang up on this call.

02:48:39.991 --> 02:48:42.352
MATT: All righty. You guys go and search for--?

02:48:42.368 --> 02:48:44.852
SAM: Jeff. Jeff's friends.

02:48:45.371 --> 02:48:48.964
MARISHA: Go back to Demi's place, Demi Lovato--
not Demi Lovato.

02:48:48.964 --> 02:48:50.622
MATT and MARISHA: Demi Leric.

02:48:53.692 --> 02:49:01.668
MATT: You find Jeff there as soon as you walk into
the door. Demi's off to the side, reading a

02:49:01.668 --> 02:49:08.356
leather-bound journal that she's either reading or
making notes in. She looks up and she goes, "Aye?"

02:49:09.158 --> 02:49:13.017
MARISHA: I look over Demi's shoulder. What is she
looking at? What is she reading?

02:49:13.017 --> 02:49:14.387
MATT: No, she pulls it back.

02:49:16.847 --> 02:49:27.050
MARISHA: Oh, hey. Didn't mean to interrupt. This
feels sensual in some ways. Tusk Love? No?

02:49:28.613 --> 02:49:29.600
Anyway--

02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:31.490
SAM: Weird opener.

02:49:33.129 --> 02:49:36.228
TRAVIS: I want to toss you a pickaxe for that
shovel you're using.

02:49:37.414 --> 02:49:39.155
MARISHA: Hey, Jeff, your friends--

02:49:39.610 --> 02:49:43.422
MATT: You look over to Jeff, who's like, "Oh, no."

02:49:43.638 --> 02:49:46.678
TRAVIS: (laughing) Don't tap my shoulder again!

02:49:46.679 --> 02:49:50.536
MARISHA: I promise I won't touch you. Your friends
that you said were helping you,

02:49:50.536 --> 02:49:52.194
that fared out better than you did?

02:49:52.194 --> 02:49:53.618
MATT: "Yeah, what about them?"

02:49:53.618 --> 02:49:57.664
MARISHA: Are they a little over their job?
You think they might want to take a little

02:49:57.664 --> 02:49:58.579
walk-about?

02:49:58.839 --> 02:50:00.926
MATT: "I mean, they can't abandon--"

02:50:00.926 --> 02:50:02.405
TRAVIS: (laughing) Their post?

02:50:03.259 --> 02:50:06.422
MATT: "That's-- no! What are you asking?"

02:50:06.541 --> 02:50:07.771
TRAVIS: Fucking AWOL!

02:50:10.431 --> 02:50:11.515
SAM: Cool.

02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:15.371
TRAVIS: They took an oath and shit.

02:50:15.413 --> 02:50:24.292
MARISHA: Do you know of any freelance people?
Mercenaries, friends who are semi-trustworthy?

02:50:24.367 --> 02:50:25.219
MATT: "What for?"

02:50:26.559 --> 02:50:30.921
MARISHA: I need an escort to take a couple of
people down to Alfield.

02:50:30.921 --> 02:50:34.062
MATT: "To Alfield? That's easy."

02:50:35.193 --> 02:50:36.791
MARISHA: Okay, can you--

02:50:39.459 --> 02:50:44.796
MATT: "My friends can probably do that. It's just
to Alfield and back; they can say it's under business."

02:50:45.021 --> 02:50:49.667
MARISHA: Yeah? Does that mean the taxpayers pay
for it and we don't have to?

02:50:49.667 --> 02:50:52.506
Is there a matter of state security?

02:50:52.506 --> 02:50:56.203
MATT: "No, you still have to pay them. This is
under the table, technically."

02:50:56.203 --> 02:51:02.548
MARISHA: Oh. That's what I would say.
All right, cool. Where do I find them?

02:51:02.868 --> 02:51:11.200
MATT: "Hold on." (groaning) He sits up
and stands up slowly.

02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:13.302
MARISHA: I try and-- let me--

02:51:13.942 --> 02:51:22.676
MATT: The two of you limp down to one of the
tiny little seedy bars that doesn't even have

02:51:22.676 --> 02:51:23.806
a name on the front.

02:51:23.806 --> 02:51:26.687
MARISHA: You don't have to guide me,
you could just tell me--

02:51:26.688 --> 02:51:30.122
MATT: "I'm going to put it out there:
you don't have a trustworthy face.

02:51:30.122 --> 02:51:33.484
"They're not going to talk to you.
I need to introduce you."

02:51:33.484 --> 02:51:36.584
MARISHA: All right. Here, you want a piggyback ride?

02:51:37.114 --> 02:51:38.642
MATT: "Don't you touch me."

02:51:39.061 --> 02:51:43.026
MARISHA: All right. You want a walking stick?
I got my staff.

02:51:43.026 --> 02:51:47.104
MATT: "I'll take that." You guys make your way in.

02:51:48.075 --> 02:51:49.406
LAURA: It's got a bow on it.

02:51:49.461 --> 02:51:51.813
MARISHA: It's got a bow, yeah.
It still has a bow.

02:51:56.741 --> 02:52:08.041
MATT: There's a handful of folks here. You see
three very, very old farmer-types that this is

02:52:08.041 --> 02:52:12.913
their retirement, is coming here everyday and
complaining and drinking themselves to an early--

02:52:12.913 --> 02:52:22.112
earlier-- grave. You do see two crownsguard that
are working their way slowly through an ale and

02:52:22.112 --> 02:52:31.051
chatting to each other. As he walks in, "Hey!" and
"Oh, what's up, hey buddy! You're walking around,

02:52:31.051 --> 02:52:36.661
"that's great!" He's like, (straining) "Yeah, I've
got a job for you. What's your name again?"

02:52:37.283 --> 02:52:38.162
MARISHA: Beau.

02:52:38.243 --> 02:52:46.227
MATT: "Beau, this is Jordan and Jay. They're going
to go ahead and help you out with this.

02:52:47.001 --> 02:52:48.326
How much are you paying?"

02:52:51.393 --> 02:52:54.121
MARISHA: Nott! How much are we paying?

02:52:54.422 --> 02:52:56.288
SAM: Whatever it fucking takes!

02:52:56.730 --> 02:52:57.878
TRAVIS: All your money.

02:52:58.096 --> 02:52:59.448
SAM: Yes, absolutely!

02:52:59.657 --> 02:53:03.996
MATT: "It's to Alfield and back. It's an escort."

02:53:04.076 --> 02:53:06.728
MARISHA: What's the average running cost
for an escort?

02:53:06.795 --> 02:53:13.175
MATT: You see the gentleman who was introduced as
Jordan goes, "Well, to and from Alfield, that's a

02:53:13.175 --> 02:53:24.527
"number of days' travel including night camping
costs, board, staying there in Alfield. I'd say,

02:53:24.527 --> 02:53:30.095
"for the each of us round-trip, puts you at
about 35 gold pieces."

02:53:31.348 --> 02:53:32.388
SAM: Give him 80.

02:53:32.701 --> 02:53:34.432
LAURA: (sounds of distress)

02:53:35.928 --> 02:53:37.029
TALIESIN: Total.

02:53:40.631 --> 02:53:44.313
MARISHA: I'll give you 80, 40 apiece. You can
split it between the two of you.

02:53:45.090 --> 02:53:48.550
Extra five gold, make sure you actually give
a fuck about this job.

02:53:49.848 --> 02:53:53.548
MATT: "You're a hard negotiator. I respect that.
It's a deal."

02:53:53.548 --> 02:53:58.894
MARISHA: Am I? Yeah. Fuck yeah, man.
Seriously, don't fuck this up.

02:53:59.564 --> 02:54:00.327
MATT: "Okay."

02:54:00.333 --> 02:54:02.761
MARISHA: I will fucking kill you if you fuck it up.

02:54:02.771 --> 02:54:11.425
MATT: "Where did you meet this woman?" He's like,
"Look, she's been this way, but she pays well,

02:54:11.425 --> 02:54:15.014
"apparently, and I want to help you guys out. I'm
going to go lay back down,"

02:54:15.014 --> 02:54:17.625
and he starts making his way back with your stick.

02:54:18.055 --> 02:54:22.154
MARISHA: Okay, you got to be at Old Edith's place
tonight with a cart. Maybe bring some

02:54:22.154 --> 02:54:25.695
sleeping bags, some extra food. There's a kid.

02:54:25.696 --> 02:54:28.194
MATT: "I missed the deal, who are we escorting?"

02:54:28.194 --> 02:54:29.467
MARISHA: Old Edith--

02:54:29.467 --> 02:54:30.216
MATT: "Edith?"

02:54:30.223 --> 02:54:34.240
MARISHA: Yeah, and Luke, the kid.

02:54:34.882 --> 02:54:35.762
SAM: To Bryce.

02:54:36.181 --> 02:54:39.253
MARISHA: To Bryce, in Alfield.

02:54:40.491 --> 02:54:47.432
MATT: "All right, I got it. No worries, we got it
taken care of. We got you taken care of!

02:54:47.432 --> 02:54:52.050
"We're good! We're just going to finish our drinks
and we'll start getting our stuff together."

02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:54.512
TRAVIS: (pigeon cooing)

02:54:54.512 --> 02:54:55.762
MARISHA: What'd you say?!

02:54:55.762 --> 02:54:59.592
TRAVIS: (cooing) I'm just a pigeon,
what do you want?

02:54:59.592 --> 02:55:01.150
MARISHA: You're just cooing!

02:55:01.251 --> 02:55:04.830
LAURA: You're not even saying anything;
you're just a pigeon!

02:55:04.831 --> 02:55:06.281
MARISHA: It's just atmosphere.

02:55:06.311 --> 02:55:10.231
MATT: Geoff has made his way partially back
to Demi's place with your staff.

02:55:10.791 --> 02:55:12.301
LAURA: Go get your staff back!

02:55:12.301 --> 02:55:13.930
MARISHA: Give me my fucking staff!

02:55:14.470 --> 02:55:16.450
MATT: "Oh, jeez! Okay."

02:55:20.004 --> 02:55:23.433
MARISHA: I do flick him in one of his burns,
though, again, just because.

02:55:23.433 --> 02:55:25.888
MATT: (groaning) "What is wrong with you?!"

02:55:25.959 --> 02:55:27.596
MARISHA: You're a good guy, Jeff.

02:55:28.276 --> 02:55:29.046
MATT: "Huh?"

02:55:29.136 --> 02:55:30.843
MARISHA: It's how I show affection.

02:55:31.754 --> 02:55:33.474
MATT: "I don't like you."

02:55:34.374 --> 02:55:35.645
MARISHA: Then I walk off.

02:55:35.645 --> 02:55:45.406
MATT: Okay. He makes his way back. You've hired
some crownsguards under the table to keep an eye

02:55:45.406 --> 02:55:50.694
and escort Edith and Luke over to Alfield to meet
with Bryce, where they're going to take care of

02:55:50.694 --> 02:55:51.940
them to some degree.

02:55:52.537 --> 02:55:53.918
SAM: Okay, so what do &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; do?

02:55:53.919 --> 02:55:55.210
MATT: Yes, what do you do?

02:55:55.862 --> 02:55:59.151
SAM: Do we go in the tunnels? Do you want to
go in the tunnels? Okay.

02:55:59.151 --> 02:56:05.371
LIAM: Well, I imagine the same guards will be out there
again. Are we just going to plunge on in and try to--

02:56:05.371 --> 02:56:10.631
TRAVIS: Do we see any of the elven folk of the two that
we have been talking about while we're walking around?

02:56:10.631 --> 02:56:12.069
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:56:12.069 --> 02:56:15.410
TALIESIN: Do you want advantage on that,
or do you want me to join you?

02:56:15.410 --> 02:56:16.651
TRAVIS: You do it as well.

02:56:16.651 --> 02:56:23.114
TALIESIN: All right. Trying to be good about this.
That's 17.

02:56:23.442 --> 02:56:24.362
MATT: Fjord?

02:56:24.362 --> 02:56:25.410
TRAVIS: That's a one.

02:56:28.152 --> 02:56:30.671
MARISHA: (stammering) You do it as well.

02:56:32.730 --> 02:56:39.233
MATT: Your head turns to the left and you're like,
"Where are those-- that cloud looks like an eagle."

02:56:43.848 --> 02:56:48.869
You, Caduceus, do a pretty fair look around.
You do not recognize anyone that resembles

02:56:48.869 --> 02:56:50.453
the figures in question.

02:56:50.517 --> 02:56:51.949
TALIESIN: No elves, all right.

02:56:52.798 --> 02:56:57.180
MATT: There are elves around, but maybe two or
three since you've come here.

02:56:57.180 --> 02:56:59.077
TALIESIN: Not with intense gravitas.

02:56:59.577 --> 02:57:03.978
MATT: There aren't many elves in
Felderwin. Most of the Empire elves

02:57:03.978 --> 02:57:09.553
are further northward, in the Zemni Fields.
You've seen a few, and a handful of

02:57:09.553 --> 02:57:12.944
half elves, but none of the type that
you are looking for.

02:57:13.199 --> 02:57:15.979
These are not the elves you're looking for.

02:57:18.264 --> 02:57:27.340
MARISHA: Can I also, just for blanket statement,
I take my gold and I parcel it out and put it in

02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:29.971
different pockets, ever since Hupperdook.

02:57:29.971 --> 02:57:32.730
MATT: Okay. Would you like to buy more pockets?
Or pouches?

02:57:32.730 --> 02:57:33.779
SAM: Buy more pockets.

02:57:33.779 --> 02:57:37.112
MATT: I mean, unless you're walking around like
Rob Liefeld character--

02:57:37.112 --> 02:57:39.821
MARISHA: I was just going to say,
is this a Liefeld comic?

02:57:39.821 --> 02:57:43.351
TALIESIN: I assume that we live in a Liefeld
universe where as you're born,

02:57:43.351 --> 02:57:45.401
you accumulate pockets slowly all over you.

02:57:45.402 --> 02:57:47.544
MATT: Yeah, and you grow more and more teeth.

02:57:47.544 --> 02:57:49.592
TALIESIN: All the way down the ankle, yeah.

02:57:49.592 --> 02:57:50.691
MATT: Your feet vanish.

02:57:50.691 --> 02:57:58.052
MARISHA: Sure. I will Liefeld float to the nearest
general store and pick up a few extra pockets.

02:57:59.056 --> 02:58:01.061
SAM: Hi, I'm here to buy some pockets?

02:58:02.358 --> 02:58:04.671
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, I'm all out.

02:58:04.834 --> 02:58:07.832
LIAM: We just won Dungeons &amp; Dragons, guys.

02:58:13.013 --> 02:58:19.333
MATT: Easy enough. You head over to the Felderwin
General, helmed by Dupont Briggsman, this young

02:58:19.334 --> 02:58:26.043
dwarven salesman. Tanned skin, light brown hair,
a bit of a chin beard. He says,

02:58:26.043 --> 02:58:27.995
"Are you looking for pockets, you said?"

02:58:27.995 --> 02:58:30.485
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. What kind of pockets you got?

02:58:30.633 --> 02:58:36.544
MATT: "Well, belt pouches, I've got money belts,
if that's what you're looking for."

02:58:38.064 --> 02:58:41.862
MARISHA: Do you have one of those where
it goes around your neck, but tucks in

02:58:41.862 --> 02:58:43.514
on the inside of your shirt?

02:58:44.984 --> 02:58:48.984
MATT: "I've got something that you could probably
affix that would be similar, maybe."

02:58:48.984 --> 02:58:53.743
MARISHA: I'll get one of those and I get one of the
money belts. Does anybody else want a money belt?

02:58:53.743 --> 02:58:55.553
(shouting) Stocking up on money belts!

02:58:55.562 --> 02:58:56.262
TRAVIS: What?

02:58:56.262 --> 02:58:57.431
MARISHA: Money belts!

02:58:57.431 --> 02:59:01.757
SAM: You brought us here for money belts. My
husband is being kidnapped by crick terrorists.

02:59:01.758 --> 02:59:06.807
MARISHA: Honestly, I thought that it was just going
to be a little quick thing and he was going to be like,

02:59:06.807 --> 02:59:09.189
"For brevity's sake," like he does, but he didn't.

02:59:09.189 --> 02:59:11.330
SAM: Sure. Nope, this is a full scene.

02:59:12.218 --> 02:59:13.730
MARISHA: I just want pockets.

02:59:13.974 --> 02:59:15.230
MATT: "So just the two?"

02:59:15.777 --> 02:59:16.810
MARISHA: Sure.

02:59:18.206 --> 02:59:20.562
MATT: "Let's say, eight silver?"

02:59:20.929 --> 02:59:21.529
MARISHA: Done.

02:59:21.961 --> 02:59:24.170
MATT: "All right, there you go." Passes it over.

02:59:25.281 --> 02:59:26.457
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.

02:59:26.522 --> 02:59:30.860
TALIESIN: Let's head to the tunnel and if that
doesn't pan out, we'll start heading north.

02:59:30.860 --> 02:59:33.953
LAURA: I rearrange some things on the shelves as
she's doing that.

02:59:33.953 --> 02:59:35.953
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check for me.

02:59:35.953 --> 02:59:37.090
SAM: Oh, fuck you.

02:59:39.360 --> 02:59:40.333
LAURA: 16.

02:59:42.216 --> 02:59:43.056
TRAVIS: Arrested.

02:59:43.157 --> 02:59:48.947
MATT: He is happily picking out and handing over
belt pouches as you completely disorganize his

02:59:48.947 --> 02:59:53.698
probably very carefully and intentionally placed
system. Well done.

02:59:53.698 --> 02:59:54.434
LAURA: Thanks.

02:59:56.415 --> 02:59:58.017
SAM: Okay, off to the tunnels.

02:59:58.018 --> 03:00:00.014
TRAVIS, SAM and LAURA: (shouting) Tunnels!

03:00:00.014 --> 03:00:02.345
MATT: You sense a faint smile over your shoulder.

03:00:02.345 --> 03:00:05.143
MATT and MARISHA: (singing) Secret tunnel.

03:00:05.143 --> 03:00:07.107
MATT: All right, making your way-- oh?

03:00:07.107 --> 03:00:08.488
SAM: Any guards around there?

03:00:08.488 --> 03:00:13.737
MATT: Oh yes. You see each tunnel has somewhere in
the neighborhood of five to six guards stationed

03:00:13.737 --> 03:00:21.467
to each. Some of them are just sitting down, bored
with their posting. They've been told to keep

03:00:21.467 --> 03:00:26.048
watch, but not a whole lot's happening until you
guys approach. You're heading towards the center

03:00:26.048 --> 03:00:30.618
tunnel, which is the one that already has the
fairly deep dig, and as you approach, the guards

03:00:30.618 --> 03:00:35.148
all stand up. Some of them are holding spears and
are using them to get to their feet. They look

03:00:35.148 --> 03:00:38.814
over in your direction. These are not the same
guards you spoke to last night.

03:00:38.814 --> 03:00:44.296
SAM: Fjord? Caduceus, any ideas on how to get our
cart down into the tunnel?

03:00:46.256 --> 03:00:47.139
TRAVIS: Wheel it?

03:00:48.198 --> 03:00:50.597
SAM: To get past the guards?

03:00:50.975 --> 03:00:54.722
TALIESIN: We honestly first have to even see if
it's possible to get in there.

03:00:54.723 --> 03:00:58.712
LIAM: We'll be lucky if we can proceed. I don't
think we can take the cart with us.

03:00:58.712 --> 03:01:02.521
MATT: The width of the tunnel as it is,
the cart's going to be a very tight fit,

03:01:02.521 --> 03:01:06.764
let alone getting two horses to pull it
for you underground.

03:01:06.954 --> 03:01:13.461
TALIESIN: I have a funny feeling that this is less
of a "we can walk all the way to Albuquerque" as

03:01:13.461 --> 03:01:19.684
more as a there's possibly something down there or
they're still in there that's just a little bit of a--

03:01:19.684 --> 03:01:23.654
SAM: It's been weeks. They're not down there.
This is folly.

03:01:23.654 --> 03:01:26.422
TALIESIN: I don't think they've been moving the
whole time.

03:01:26.422 --> 03:01:31.901
LIAM: It's worth just checking the box. Perhaps it
connects to a larger cave system that they used--

03:01:31.902 --> 03:01:33.853
we don't know-- but the cart cannot come.

03:01:34.333 --> 03:01:39.983
SAM: The easiest way to check is for, sorry,
Jester, to go look.

03:01:39.983 --> 03:01:51.791
LAURA: Yeah. I'll go look. If we can get down
there. Hey, so, we were here yesterday.

03:01:52.352 --> 03:01:57.064
MATT: They all look at each other and one of them
who looks probably to have a little more authority

03:01:57.064 --> 03:02:01.340
who has probably been assigned to be the head of
the rest of the crownsguard, steps forward

03:02:01.340 --> 03:02:02.793
and goes, "Yeah, what of it?"

03:02:04.772 --> 03:02:10.414
TRAVIS: We're part of a research expedition. We
were here and we were hoping we could toss you a

03:02:10.414 --> 03:02:14.851
little bit of coin and, you know, check out this
area here a bit.

03:02:15.637 --> 03:02:21.345
TALIESIN: We pinged something in the center cave
and we just needed to reconvene before we

03:02:21.345 --> 03:02:23.014
came back to take a look at it.

03:02:23.082 --> 03:02:25.984
MATT: "And by whose guidance are you assigned to
do this?"

03:02:27.565 --> 03:02:35.780
MARISHA: Cobalt Soul. Beauregard. Been taking
notes. From Zadash.

03:02:36.577 --> 03:02:38.150
MATT: "They've signed authority?"

03:02:38.818 --> 03:02:42.675
MARISHA: Yeah, it's called this belt and these
vestiges on my fucking body.

03:02:43.076 --> 03:02:43.930
LAURA: Shit.

03:02:44.675 --> 03:02:47.825
MATT: "You make a deception check, you make an
intimidation check."

03:02:48.775 --> 03:02:51.568
SAM: You just pointed to two orange pockets.

03:02:54.376 --> 03:02:55.540
MATT: Made in Felderwin.

03:02:56.055 --> 03:02:56.896
TRAVIS: 24.

03:02:56.896 --> 03:03:00.186
MARISHA: 15. You said intimidation, right?

03:03:00.187 --> 03:03:10.980
MATT: Yes. The guy looks at both of you and his
chest-puffed moment of bravado begins to slowly

03:03:10.980 --> 03:03:18.927
deflate and goes, "Right, okay. What are you
looking to do? You just inspecting?"

03:03:21.216 --> 03:03:27.247
TRAVIS: It's very boring, actually. Yeah. Quite
tedious. You use little picks and little brushes,

03:03:27.247 --> 03:03:28.556
and we covered little--

03:03:28.556 --> 03:03:30.270
MATT: "Yeah, yeah. I don't really--"

03:03:30.270 --> 03:03:34.736
TRAVIS: You take a while, and then you brush it
and spit on it, you know? Did you want to join?

03:03:35.516 --> 03:03:36.231
MATT: "No."

03:03:36.231 --> 03:03:40.135
TRAVIS: It's really quite relaxing. Actually, my
friend over here can attest to it.

03:03:40.135 --> 03:03:43.755
TALIESIN: Actually, he'll keep talking like this
if we don't get him to work.

03:03:43.755 --> 03:03:45.657
I don't know how that-- I don't really--

03:03:45.657 --> 03:03:47.133
MATT: "Oh, just do your thing."

03:03:47.133 --> 03:03:48.800
TALIESIN: I'm on you. Fjord and I--

03:03:48.800 --> 03:03:54.162
MATT: He steps aside. The other guards, they're
eyeing you close; they still have a job to do.

03:03:54.162 --> 03:03:58.562
They don't trust you implicitly, but at least
they're stepping out of your path to let you

03:03:58.563 --> 03:04:00.986
go about what business you're attending to.

03:04:02.377 --> 03:04:05.955
LAURA: So we can get down to the barrier where it
stops being clear?

03:04:06.696 --> 03:04:10.956
MATT: You can climb down because it starts off
pretty decent. Where's the cart being left?

03:04:11.096 --> 03:04:12.892
Or are you bringing it down with you?

03:04:12.892 --> 03:04:15.411
LAURA: It's staying at the inn for the time being.

03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:21.430
MATT: Okay. The cart has been set at the inn then.
Are you pre-purchasing board for it?

03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:25.071
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:04:26.172 --> 03:04:26.881
LAURA: Sure.

03:04:27.759 --> 03:04:29.369
LIAM: Yeah, I will cover the cost of that.

03:04:29.778 --> 03:04:35.167
MATT: I mean, it can stay there as long as you're
renting rooms there, but if you just want it to be

03:04:35.168 --> 03:04:39.508
kept there, it's a little bit cheaper, but you
still have to pay in advance for how long you

03:04:39.508 --> 03:04:41.048
intend to leave it there for storage.

03:04:41.248 --> 03:04:44.399
TALIESIN: We don't really know what this is going
to look like yet.

03:04:44.421 --> 03:04:45.220
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:04:45.599 --> 03:04:46.459
SAM: Two weeks.

03:04:47.668 --> 03:04:51.538
TRAVIS: Three. Deal.

03:04:51.660 --> 03:04:52.827
SAM: So 16 days.

03:04:55.987 --> 03:05:00.898
LIAM: Excuse me, how much would it cost to house
our cart here for a month?

03:05:01.078 --> 03:05:06.728
MATT: Right. You come back and, talking to
Simone Deepwell, he's like,

03:05:06.728 --> 03:05:08.944
"All right, so, three weeks, you're saying?"

03:05:08.944 --> 03:05:09.689
LIAM: A month.

03:05:09.689 --> 03:05:16.606
MATT: "A month. Okay. Just the cart and the horse?
All right, I'll go ahead and talk to Babs about

03:05:16.607 --> 03:05:18.271
"holding the horse, we can go to--"

03:05:18.271 --> 03:05:20.272
SAM: The answer is yes. Whatever it costs.

03:05:20.272 --> 03:05:26.196
MATT: "Oh, okay. Well, for board on that, it's
going to run about three silver a night.

03:05:26.196 --> 03:05:28.622
"We'll say for 30 nights it'll be--"

03:05:29.112 --> 03:05:29.931
SAM: Done.

03:05:33.311 --> 03:05:34.334
TRAVIS: We kill him.

03:05:34.514 --> 03:05:37.836
MATT: That's 90 silver, so nine gold pieces for
the month.

03:05:38.104 --> 03:05:42.685
LIAM: Not a problem. Here you are. One. Two.

03:05:42.685 --> 03:05:43.474
LAURA: No!

03:05:45.213 --> 03:05:46.283
SAM: Take care of it.

03:05:48.003 --> 03:05:49.942
MARISHA: It's like being at the DMV.

03:05:52.092 --> 03:05:56.596
MATT: (fast forward noise) Back up to the point.
You guys make yourselves down into the tunnel.

03:05:56.597 --> 03:06:00.664
Three guards do follow behind at a distance, just
keeping an eye on what you're doing.

03:06:00.664 --> 03:06:01.762
SAM: Who's going in?

03:06:01.762 --> 03:06:03.614
LAURA and TALIESIN: We're all going in.

03:06:03.615 --> 03:06:05.345
SAM: No, but who's going past?

03:06:05.345 --> 03:06:06.054
LAURA: Me.

03:06:06.054 --> 03:06:07.983
TALIESIN: Are you going to be all right?

03:06:07.983 --> 03:06:08.704
LAURA: Yeah.

03:06:08.705 --> 03:06:09.939
SAM: She's super strong.

03:06:11.379 --> 03:06:16.463
LAURA: Sure, and I will stay super strong as I get
down there and Polymorph myself.

03:06:17.585 --> 03:06:19.898
MATT: Oh shit. Into?

03:06:25.022 --> 03:06:30.114
LAURA: A mole? A gopher? Maybe a gopher.

03:06:30.333 --> 03:06:32.353
TALIESIN: What's big? A tiny gopher?

03:06:32.794 --> 03:06:37.534
LAURA: You know what burrows that's bigger,
is a honey badger.

03:06:37.684 --> 03:06:38.524
SAM: Oh yeah.

03:06:38.684 --> 03:06:41.844
LAURA: A honey badger. They burrow and are
stronger, too.

03:06:43.424 --> 03:06:44.705
MATT: Okay, hold on here.

03:06:44.741 --> 03:06:51.341
TALIESIN: Wait a minute? Can you make people bigger?

03:06:52.528 --> 03:06:55.380
LIAM: For a brief period of time, yeah. Brief.

03:06:55.381 --> 03:06:57.561
TALIESIN: Can you make a honey badger bigger?

03:06:57.561 --> 03:06:59.240
LIAM: Yeah, for a minute.

03:07:01.050 --> 03:07:02.451
TRAVIS: The size of a dog?

03:07:02.941 --> 03:07:06.950
MATT: A beast of any challenge rating that is
equal to or less than the target.

03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:09.790
So it can be a CR seven or lower.

03:07:10.940 --> 03:07:13.221
MARISHA: Liam Las Vegas is having a weird day.

03:07:13.221 --> 03:07:18.001
MATT: Actually, technically, because-- as you guys
rested for the evening and you've completed your

03:07:18.001 --> 03:07:23.092
journey here and you've begun this next venture--
technically for the night, you guys would hit level eight.

03:07:23.092 --> 03:07:24.691
ALL: What?!

03:07:24.691 --> 03:07:25.511
MATT: This is a heads up.

03:07:26.141 --> 03:07:26.981
LIAM: Oh jeez.

03:07:28.083 --> 03:07:35.766
MATT: We'll deal with that shortly, but for the time
being, a CR eight or smaller beast, you could be.

03:07:35.767 --> 03:07:40.612
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. Where would I find that
on D&amp;D Beyond?

03:07:40.824 --> 03:07:41.683
LIAM: Creatures.

03:07:41.734 --> 03:07:44.329
MATT: You go to Monsters and you would choose Beast.

03:07:44.330 --> 03:07:46.344
LIAM: All the way to the right, Creatures.

03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:56.842
MATT: Then for the CR range, you would put from--
I'd say, for safety, one to eight.

03:07:58.272 --> 03:08:00.455
LAURA: Where are you finding it?

03:08:00.455 --> 03:08:03.087
SAM: You're right, there's not really anywhere to look.

03:08:03.087 --> 03:08:03.808
TALIESIN: Wait.

03:08:03.808 --> 03:08:05.184
LAURA: I don't see Creatures.

03:08:05.184 --> 03:08:09.065
LIAM: Creatures is over here, so Actions,
blah blah blah, all of them are right--

03:08:09.066 --> 03:08:10.246
SAM: Yeah, and then what?

03:08:10.246 --> 03:08:13.106
LIAM: Tap it and then search. Just start typing in a name.

03:08:13.106 --> 03:08:14.927
TRAVIS: Honey badger does not come up.

03:08:14.927 --> 03:08:16.858
MATT: Welcome to the world of the druid.

03:08:16.858 --> 03:08:17.827
LAURA: Oh god.

03:08:17.828 --> 03:08:20.976
LIAM: Then use... Google.

03:08:20.976 --> 03:08:28.346
LAURA: Oh my gosh, wait? This is too complicated.
I got lost in the-- it got lost in the nervous!

03:08:28.346 --> 03:08:30.833
SAM: This won't be a problem when I'm the president.

03:08:30.863 --> 03:08:33.506
(laughter)

03:08:33.506 --> 03:08:35.186
LIAM: For a badger, a honey badger?

03:08:35.186 --> 03:08:38.925
MARISHA: You can just-- I think if you go to the
top and search "CR 8."

03:08:39.225 --> 03:08:40.646
LAURA: Look up level eight.

03:08:41.576 --> 03:08:43.594
MATT: Look up from levels one to eight.

03:08:43.594 --> 03:08:46.596
SAM: Elephant, ape, giant constrictor
snake, giant elk.

03:08:46.596 --> 03:08:48.406
LAURA: I need something that burrows.

03:08:48.406 --> 03:08:49.396
TRAVIS: Be an elk.

03:08:49.396 --> 03:08:50.676
TALIESIN: Don't be an elk.

03:08:50.676 --> 03:08:55.717
TRAVIS: Be an elk and kill all of these fucking
soldiers. (roars)

03:08:55.717 --> 03:08:59.725
MARISHA: So majestic. So proud.

03:09:00.425 --> 03:09:03.645
MATT: You know what? Laura, make an
intelligence check.

03:09:03.645 --> 03:09:05.345
LAURA: Oh god. Aww.

03:09:06.416 --> 03:09:08.356
LIAM: As high as challenge rating what?

03:09:09.376 --> 03:09:15.146
LAURA: Oh! I rolled pretty-- I think I-- Hold on,
I've got to get back to my character.

03:09:15.146 --> 03:09:17.105
TALIESIN: You rolled really well, though.

03:09:17.106 --> 03:09:18.777
LAURA: I did, I rolled pretty good.

03:09:18.777 --> 03:09:20.876
TALIESIN: Hit the view-- yeah, there you go.

03:09:20.876 --> 03:09:22.496
LAURA: Hit the view button, Laura.

03:09:22.497 --> 03:09:24.597
TALIESIN: I get lost in here, so, I feel it.

03:09:24.597 --> 03:09:28.516
LAURA: Okay. Plus-- so 16! I rolled well, but my
intelligence is pretty lame.

03:09:28.646 --> 03:09:38.467
MATT: Okay. There are beasts in the wild. There
are wolves, there are cats, there are bears.

03:09:38.467 --> 03:09:45.666
You've run across a number of larger versions of
these, more dangerous and ominous ones, like when

03:09:45.666 --> 03:09:53.375
you were in the Savalierwood briefly, you came
across a few dire wolves. Use your creative mind

03:09:53.375 --> 03:10:01.055
on what other possible dire creatures might exist.

03:10:01.107 --> 03:10:02.567
LAURA: Oh, like a dire badger?

03:10:02.567 --> 03:10:03.826
MATT: You can try it.

03:10:04.476 --> 03:10:06.615
LAURA: Okay, I want to be a dire honey badger!

03:10:06.786 --> 03:10:15.965
MATT: Whether or not one exists, the creative
imagination of Jester creates a Polymorph form as

03:10:15.965 --> 03:10:24.946
you watch her body expand and extend into a
massive honey badger, maybe six feet from nose

03:10:24.946 --> 03:10:36.068
to tail tip, with a series of bony protrusions
that run down its back like two spines.

03:10:36.068 --> 03:10:44.497
Large teeth and claws that definitely arc and
curve outward to about five, six inches

03:10:44.497 --> 03:10:47.307
beyond the center of the paw, unretracted.

03:10:48.197 --> 03:10:49.555
TRAVIS: Unretracted.

03:10:50.815 --> 03:10:54.555
LAURA: (snorting)

03:10:54.635 --> 03:10:57.538
MATT: You watch as the guards take a step back,
like, "Uh..."

03:10:58.208 --> 03:11:00.449
TRAVIS: It's all normal down here, how are you?

03:11:01.159 --> 03:11:03.368
LAURA: I turn back and I go (giggle).

03:11:03.368 --> 03:11:05.818
MATT: How long does that last? It lasts for an
hour?

03:11:05.818 --> 03:11:09.957
LAURA: Yeah. Can I talk in Polymorph? No, I'm
straight up that thing.

03:11:09.957 --> 03:11:12.247
MATT: No, you are a dire honey badger.

03:11:12.247 --> 03:11:13.896
LAURA: (honey badger sounds)

03:11:13.896 --> 03:11:14.608
SAM: Dig!

03:11:14.608 --> 03:11:18.658
LAURA: I'm digging! That's what I'm doing! That's
just-- that's what this-- (snarling)

03:11:18.659 --> 03:11:28.017
MATT: All right, I will say-- go ahead and make an
athletics check for me, adding what would be the

03:11:28.017 --> 03:11:32.978
honey badger's strength, a dire honey badger--
I'll say plus three. So, roll a d20, add plus three.

03:11:33.028 --> 03:11:35.453
LAURA: Aww! It was so good and then it went to
shit!

03:11:35.454 --> 03:11:37.367
SAM: Aww, it was so close. Yeah, it did.

03:11:37.367 --> 03:11:38.094
LAURA: Eight.

03:11:38.401 --> 03:11:46.333
MATT: It's going to take you-- it's a good period of
time here of you carving through and taking a break.

03:11:46.333 --> 03:11:51.122
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bless on the honey
badger just to see if that will help.

03:11:51.942 --> 03:11:54.833
I'm going to Bless the honey badger.

03:11:54.858 --> 03:11:56.680
LAURA: Do I add plus a d4?

03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:01.741
MATT: You would've had to cast it in advance, but
I'll say, in watching this happen-- Bless only

03:12:01.741 --> 03:12:09.234
lasts a minute, but for that time period, you get
a little further and we'll say you start getting

03:12:09.234 --> 03:12:15.391
more and more exhausted, and then you reach a
certain point where the spell expires and your

03:12:15.392 --> 03:12:23.372
form reverts to a very sweaty, exhausted Jester.
You've carved quite a way. You've pushed probably

03:12:23.372 --> 03:12:29.612
an additional, in the past hour-- Oh, man.
Another hundred or so feet into the tunnel.

03:12:32.032 --> 03:12:33.022
SAM: Cast it again.

03:12:33.752 --> 03:12:36.753
LAURA: (panting) I can't. It is a really high
level. Oh, wait.

03:12:36.753 --> 03:12:40.430
Do I get another level four at level eight? I don't know.

03:12:40.430 --> 03:12:42.618
MATT: I'm going to go check right now for you.

03:12:42.618 --> 03:12:43.432
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:48.871
TALIESIN: I'm going to start tapping on the walls
of that tunnel-- Well, no.

03:12:48.871 --> 03:12:50.551
That tunnel's really thin. If we can--

03:12:50.846 --> 03:12:53.449
MATT: At level eight, you get a second 4th-level slot.

03:12:53.449 --> 03:12:56.604
LAURA: I have another 4th-level spell, you guys.
I can do it again!

03:12:56.604 --> 03:12:57.717
SAM: Do it again!

03:12:57.717 --> 03:12:59.289
LAURA: Okay. (deep breath)

03:12:59.289 --> 03:13:03.405
MATT: (boosh) Back into your dire
honey badger form.

03:13:03.405 --> 03:13:04.397
TALIESIN: And Bless!

03:13:05.547 --> 03:13:08.945
MATT: Go ahead and make another athletics check.
Add plus three, plus a d4.

03:13:08.946 --> 03:13:10.552
LAURA: Don't fuck me!

03:13:10.552 --> 03:13:13.823
LIAM: Get us to the Underdark, Laura!
Take us to the Underdark.

03:13:13.823 --> 03:13:14.946
MARISHA: Gil!

03:13:15.237 --> 03:13:17.016
LAURA: Gil fucked me.

03:13:17.951 --> 03:13:20.339
TALIESIN: Add your plus four; your d4.

03:13:20.339 --> 03:13:24.648
LAURA: Okay. Well, at least that's ten.

03:13:25.328 --> 03:13:26.959
MATT: Ten. Okay.

03:13:26.959 --> 03:13:27.943
MARISHA: He fucked you.

03:13:27.943 --> 03:13:28.755
LAURA: He fucked me.

03:13:31.912 --> 03:13:32.742
MATT: Anyway.

03:13:34.697 --> 03:13:35.562
TRAVIS: Gil!

03:13:39.770 --> 03:13:45.501
MATT: You push on for the next 40 or 50 or so
minutes, getting an additional 70, 80 feet

03:13:45.811 --> 03:13:52.370
before eventually one of your paws goes through.
You carve through, and you reach

03:13:52.370 --> 03:13:55.503
the other side of this collapsed tunnel.

03:13:56.913 --> 03:13:58.496
TRAVIS: And we all instantly die.

03:13:58.732 --> 03:13:59.699
LAURA: Yeah, right?

03:14:00.919 --> 03:14:02.825
MATT: As the molten l-- No, I'm kidding.

03:14:02.825 --> 03:14:03.778
TRAVIS: No!

03:14:03.828 --> 03:14:04.538
MATT: No.

03:14:04.538 --> 03:14:05.770
TALIESIN: Minecraft!

03:14:05.770 --> 03:14:07.862
MATT: We've all made this mistake, Taliesin.

03:14:07.862 --> 03:14:08.591
TALIESIN: No!

03:14:09.618 --> 03:14:11.595
LIAM: Pick, pick, pick, argh!

03:14:11.595 --> 03:14:12.755
MATT: Granite, granite!

03:14:13.609 --> 03:14:20.501
LAURA: As soon as I make a hole I'll turn back
into myself and peek through.

03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:22.068
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:14:23.650 --> 03:14:28.510
LAURA: Do we still have Bless? No, that only lasts
for a minute. 14.

03:14:29.380 --> 03:14:34.549
MATT: 14. As you look past, there's no light
source in there, and the hole is only large enough

03:14:34.549 --> 03:14:38.921
for you to kind of fit your torso through as you
glance in. But in the distance you can see--

03:14:38.921 --> 03:14:41.249
What is the distance on your darkvision, 60 feet?

03:14:41.250 --> 03:14:42.110
LAURA: Yes.

03:14:43.060 --> 03:14:46.249
MATT: Pretty sure it's 60 feet. It's a pretty
standard 60 feet for--

03:14:46.249 --> 03:14:47.771
LAURA: Darkvision, 60 feet; yes.

03:14:47.771 --> 03:15:01.859
MATT: Got you. The tunnel widens and drops off,
like a cliff. You hear a very, very faint sound.

03:15:01.859 --> 03:15:03.469
It sounds like running water.

03:15:08.419 --> 03:15:09.772
LAURA: Is everybody with me?

03:15:09.772 --> 03:15:10.501
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:15:10.501 --> 03:15:11.980
MATT: They're behind you, yeah.

03:15:12.262 --> 03:15:15.095
LAURA: You guys! I think there's a river down
here!

03:15:15.095 --> 03:15:19.407
SAM: They didn't just burrow from Xhorhas,
they floated.

03:15:19.407 --> 03:15:23.106
LAURA: Yeah! That's how they do it so quickly
or whatever.

03:15:24.266 --> 03:15:27.819
MARISHA: I wonder where this underwater system
goes.

03:15:27.879 --> 03:15:29.816
TRAVIS: Yeah, they all float down here.

03:15:30.856 --> 03:15:31.625
SAM: Nope.

03:15:33.377 --> 03:15:35.600
MATT: Don't want to run into that CR creature.

03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:38.076
MARISHA: It's like a stream?
Oh, we're not there yet.

03:15:38.076 --> 03:15:39.178
MATT: You're not there.

03:15:39.178 --> 03:15:41.792
MARISHA: We haven't seen anything yet.
Okay, never mind.

03:15:41.792 --> 03:15:43.702
SAM: Can you send some light down there?

03:15:43.702 --> 03:15:45.881
TALIESIN: I'm not-- I don't know where we are.

03:15:45.881 --> 03:15:50.208
MATT: You guys are all back in the tunnel. It's
been dug through, and all of a sudden Jester

03:15:50.208 --> 03:15:54.580
creates a small hole and then plugs it with
herself. You just see the back of Jester, halfway

03:15:54.581 --> 03:15:57.531
stuck; almost like Winnie the Pooh trying to exit
the domicile.

03:15:57.531 --> 03:16:00.390
TALIESIN: You'd have to flip around and come back,
I suppose.

03:16:00.390 --> 03:16:02.149
LAURA: Yeah, I pull my head back out.

03:16:02.149 --> 03:16:05.333
TRAVIS: Or you could go check it out by yourself
and see what it is.

03:16:05.333 --> 03:16:07.235
LAURA: What am I? Who do you think I am?

03:16:07.235 --> 03:16:07.957
TRAVIS: Jester.

03:16:07.957 --> 03:16:08.916
SAM: Caleb, go look.

03:16:08.917 --> 03:16:12.297
TALIESIN: Do not send the cleric into the pit of
the unknown!

03:16:12.897 --> 03:16:15.184
LIAM: Oh, this new item.

03:16:15.965 --> 03:16:16.776
SAM: The ball?

03:16:16.776 --> 03:16:17.735
LIAM: It follows me.

03:16:17.735 --> 03:16:19.333
MARISHA: Keep it away from Fjord.

03:16:19.333 --> 03:16:21.803
SAM: You'll break it. Just send some Dancing Lights.

03:16:21.824 --> 03:16:23.774
LAURA: Send some Dancing Lights in there.

03:16:23.775 --> 03:16:26.645
LIAM: I know, I was just curious about my new--
Okay.

03:16:26.645 --> 03:16:31.274
MATT: Okay, globes appear. By the way, I'm trying
to remember. Did you guys take the gray vial

03:16:31.275 --> 03:16:33.072
with you or did you leave it behind?

03:16:33.072 --> 03:16:34.128
LAURA: No, we took it.

03:16:34.128 --> 03:16:35.412
LIAM: Yeah, and the tripod.

03:16:35.412 --> 03:16:36.362
MATT: Got you. Cool.

03:16:36.363 --> 03:16:38.888
TALIESIN: We have all the dumb shit we shouldn't
have.

03:16:38.898 --> 03:16:41.290
MATT: Before we moved on, I just want to make
sure.

03:16:41.290 --> 03:16:43.477
TRAVIS: We didn't Identify it, though, did we?

03:16:43.477 --> 03:16:44.195
LIAM: No.

03:16:44.195 --> 03:16:47.294
MATT: The globes appear. Are you on the other side
of the chamber?

03:16:47.294 --> 03:16:48.055
SAM: He went in.

03:16:48.055 --> 03:16:49.680
MATT: Did you go through the hole?

03:16:49.680 --> 03:16:51.970
LIAM: The hole that was dug by our honey badger?

03:16:51.970 --> 03:16:52.684
MATT: Correct.

03:16:52.684 --> 03:16:53.384
LIAM: Yeah.

03:16:53.384 --> 03:16:57.858
MATT: All right. You step through and (bloom,
bloom, bloom) the orbs appear, and it illuminates

03:16:57.858 --> 03:17:04.314
the chamber. And it is a chamber. What you've
stepped into appears to be a subterranean cavern.

03:17:05.633 --> 03:17:13.884
About 30 or 40 feet ahead of you it drops off, and
looks to be about a ten-foot drop before it hits

03:17:13.884 --> 03:17:21.095
another straightaway. As it curves to the left,
you've already smelled the minerals and the

03:17:21.095 --> 03:17:27.984
hard water smell of the interior of this chamber.
You glance over to the side and let the orbs drift

03:17:27.984 --> 03:17:33.454
over a little further, and you can see a river.
It's an underground river, and it seems to have

03:17:33.455 --> 03:17:41.493
carved its way through this lower portion of the
chamber. It vanishes further below into--

03:17:41.493 --> 03:17:44.514
LIAM: As a point, can I tell if we're walking into
any bullshit?

03:17:44.514 --> 03:17:45.944
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:17:45.944 --> 03:17:50.546
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja&lt;/i&gt;, okay. Real bad: nine.

03:17:50.546 --> 03:17:51.693
MATT: Coast looks clear.

03:17:51.693 --> 03:17:53.696
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Nein!

03:17:54.346 --> 03:18:03.956
MATT: But you also notice, as the orbs move
through, there are crystal-like, I want to say

03:18:05.536 --> 03:18:15.104
like quartz crystals, that jut from certain
portions of the ceiling, and elements of various--

03:18:15.994 --> 03:18:19.244
I always mess up on this: stalactites.

03:18:19.244 --> 03:18:20.053
SAM: Yes!

03:18:20.054 --> 03:18:20.775
LAURA: Yeah.

03:18:20.775 --> 03:18:24.915
MATT: I've taught myself a million times since I
was a kid, and it always transposes--

03:18:24.915 --> 03:18:26.294
TALIESIN: At the last second.

03:18:26.294 --> 03:18:33.174
MATT: I know! I'm always like-- Ugh, never right.
Stalactites that come down quite a bit from about

03:18:33.174 --> 03:18:37.824
a 15-foot-high ceiling from where you're standing,
that almost reach the floor where you are.

03:18:37.824 --> 03:18:43.615
But over this point where it hangs--
Or where it ends and goes further below.

03:18:43.616 --> 03:18:45.186
Do you send the orbs out further?

03:18:45.186 --> 03:18:52.034
LIAM: No, I'm going to pull them back to me and
lose three of them, and pull out that rag that I

03:18:52.034 --> 03:18:57.277
carry around, and cover them so that it's even
dimmer. My transmutation stone is set so that

03:18:57.277 --> 03:18:59.795
I can see in dim light.

03:18:59.795 --> 03:19:05.406
TALIESIN: I'm going to be the last one. Who's the last
one going through the tunnel before we head over?

03:19:05.406 --> 03:19:06.936
MATT: Are you all going through?

03:19:06.936 --> 03:19:07.986
TRAVIS: Going through.

03:19:07.986 --> 03:19:09.776
LIAM: Who wants to walk with me?

03:19:09.776 --> 03:19:10.676
SAM: Yes.

03:19:10.676 --> 03:19:14.447
MATT: As you're doing this, the one guard is,
"Oh hey, uh--"

03:19:14.447 --> 03:19:19.957
TALIESIN: Yeah. We've just gotten access to a
small pocket that we're just going to check out,

03:19:19.957 --> 03:19:25.466
make sure everything's safe and appropriate. We'll
have a full report once we've finished taking a

03:19:25.466 --> 03:19:32.145
look inside and we'll be delivering it. But in the
meantime, let's not cause any undue panic.

03:19:33.395 --> 03:19:39.854
We'll let you know, or we'll make some noise if
anything dangerous is down there. It still could

03:19:39.855 --> 03:19:44.577
not be safe. You're welcome to come, but I'm not
sure if it's going to be-- I can't guarantee any

03:19:44.577 --> 03:19:46.196
safety beyond this point.

03:19:46.196 --> 03:19:47.825
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:19:47.825 --> 03:19:49.754
SAM: Is that deception? All right.

03:19:49.754 --> 03:19:57.957
MATT: It's riding a line. I'll allow persuasion.
Only because you're being vague enough with it

03:19:57.957 --> 03:19:59.924
that you're riding the line.

03:19:59.924 --> 03:20:02.505
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you. Okay, that's a 20.

03:20:03.685 --> 03:20:11.015
MATT: He goes, "Okay, I guess just give us a
holler if something goes down."

03:20:11.015 --> 03:20:14.436
TALIESIN: Thank you, sir. I appreciate everything
that you do and--

03:20:14.766 --> 03:20:21.798
MATT: "Give a loud holler. We're going to probably
scoot back, this is a bit creepy."

03:20:21.798 --> 03:20:24.717
TALIESIN: If things go real wrong, you'll
definitely hear us.

03:20:24.817 --> 03:20:25.567
TRAVIS: (yells)

03:20:25.567 --> 03:20:26.946
MATT: (surprised exclamation)

03:20:26.947 --> 03:20:28.777
TRAVIS: Sorry, I tripped. My fault.

03:20:28.777 --> 03:20:32.296
TALIESIN: I'll make sure that he's quiet, because
we don't mind losing him.

03:20:33.166 --> 03:20:34.486
MATT: "Well, good luck."

03:20:35.256 --> 03:20:36.746
TALIESIN: I appreciate that.

03:20:37.926 --> 03:20:42.456
MATT: "Okay." He turns around, the guards start
leaving. You hear this very faint, echoing voice

03:20:42.456 --> 03:20:44.238
going, "They're fucking crazy!"

03:20:45.204 --> 03:20:52.334
TALIESIN: Crazy like a badger! (badger noises)
I'm into it.

03:20:52.708 --> 03:20:55.805
MATT: So you guys make your way through the tunnel
and join Caleb.

03:20:55.805 --> 03:20:56.621
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

03:20:56.818 --> 03:21:03.477
MATT: As you all step into the interior, you can
also take in that smell of long-sealed underground

03:21:03.477 --> 03:21:10.167
water, hearing the rushing of the small river. You
can see where the path continues on, and with the

03:21:10.167 --> 03:21:18.847
dim glow and the darkvision, where it curves
forward you can see a faint natural arch that

03:21:18.847 --> 03:21:22.046
looks to be a continuation of the tunnel.

03:21:22.046 --> 03:21:27.657
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, those crystals feel utterly
natural, right? It just feels like those were not--

03:21:27.657 --> 03:21:28.975
MATT: Make a nature check.

03:21:29.455 --> 03:21:30.466
TALIESIN: All right.

03:21:30.531 --> 03:21:34.311
SAM: Do we have anything to float on?
A boat or anything?

03:21:34.311 --> 03:21:35.072
TALIESIN: Seven.

03:21:35.492 --> 03:21:36.351
TRAVIS: A boat?

03:21:36.351 --> 03:21:38.171
MATT: Seven? Probably?

03:21:38.831 --> 03:21:40.510
MARISHA: We left it in Nicodranas.

03:21:40.510 --> 03:21:41.472
TALIESIN: All right.

03:21:41.473 --> 03:21:44.705
TRAVIS: I have this boat dagger, I throw it at the
wall and (fwoosh).

03:21:44.705 --> 03:21:46.701
TALIESIN: I'm thinking about Detect-- Nah.

03:21:46.701 --> 03:21:48.127
LAURA: I could draw one!

03:21:48.127 --> 03:21:49.400
SAM: Fuck yes.

03:21:50.331 --> 03:21:54.521
TALIESIN: Just before we move on, is anyone
bothered by these crystals? Is this--

03:21:54.521 --> 03:21:55.531
SAM: Are they creepy?

03:21:55.551 --> 03:21:58.821
LIAM: Do you hear anything? Do you see any kind of
traps left behind?

03:21:58.821 --> 03:22:02.058
TALIESIN: I'm a little out of my element,
which is surprising to say.

03:22:02.058 --> 03:22:04.861
SAM: Traps? On the ceiling?
Sure, I'll look for traps.

03:22:04.861 --> 03:22:07.569
LIAM: The people could put them on the ground
or anywhere.

03:22:07.569 --> 03:22:09.000
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:12.520
TALIESIN: It's difficult, because we don't really
understand how they work.

03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:13.430
SAM: Investigation?

03:22:13.430 --> 03:22:17.520
MATT: This is perception because you're looking at
things in the distance as opposed to

03:22:17.520 --> 03:22:19.381
carefully checking what's on the floor.

03:22:19.382 --> 03:22:20.333
SAM: Perception. 17.

03:22:20.333 --> 03:22:22.834
MATT: 17? Does not appear to be trapped.

03:22:22.834 --> 03:22:23.803
TALIESIN: All right.

03:22:23.804 --> 03:22:24.685
SAM: Looks okay.

03:22:24.856 --> 03:22:28.378
TALIESIN: Let's all prepare to be a little
confused by whatever we find.

03:22:28.378 --> 03:22:31.396
We're going to be way out of our element.

03:22:31.396 --> 03:22:34.766
MATT and TRAVIS: Dead men tell no tales...

03:22:34.766 --> 03:22:37.428
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without Trace on us and
stuff?

03:22:37.428 --> 03:22:39.049
SAM: There's nothing to hide from.

03:22:39.049 --> 03:22:41.237
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's nobody down here but us.

03:22:41.237 --> 03:22:43.287
SAM: You need your spells for other things.

03:22:43.287 --> 03:22:45.195
TALIESIN: If we start to hear something.

03:22:45.196 --> 03:22:48.427
MARISHA: Feels like there's always things to hide
from. I don't know.

03:22:48.427 --> 03:22:49.726
TRAVIS: Except now.

03:22:51.236 --> 03:22:52.298
MARISHA: Okay.

03:22:54.008 --> 03:22:56.286
LAURA: I cast Pass Without Trace on all of us.

03:22:56.389 --> 03:23:00.838
SAM: Guys, there's no one I would rather go rescue
my husband with.

03:23:00.838 --> 03:23:02.617
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Aww.

03:23:02.977 --> 03:23:05.008
MARISHA: Did you all get a honeymoon?

03:23:05.138 --> 03:23:07.398
SAM: No, we never did.

03:23:07.398 --> 03:23:09.647
MARISHA: On the way back: great road trip.

03:23:09.647 --> 03:23:10.818
SAM: You're right.

03:23:10.818 --> 03:23:13.058
MARISHA: With seven of your other best friends.

03:23:13.058 --> 03:23:17.709
SAM: You're right, we never-- We always talked
about going to... Tal'Dorei--

03:23:17.759 --> 03:23:22.076
(laughter)

03:23:22.146 --> 03:23:30.078
SAM: For our honeymoon. Never happened. We were
saving! I heard Whitestone's really nice.

03:23:30.458 --> 03:23:31.717
TALIESIN: Tourist trap.

03:23:31.717 --> 03:23:34.537
MARISHA: Especially in the spring.
(laughing) Tourist trap!

03:23:35.737 --> 03:23:41.237
LIAM: From everything I read, Ghor Dranas is
mysterious and exotic, so let's press on.

03:23:41.237 --> 03:23:43.026
I'm going to start walking forward.

03:23:43.026 --> 03:23:43.958
TALIESIN: Let's go.

03:23:43.958 --> 03:23:50.115
MATT: As you guys begin to step forward into the
darkened, subterranean shadows of this newly

03:23:50.116 --> 03:23:54.697
discovered tunnel system, and wherever it will lead
you eastward, we're going to go ahead and

03:23:54.697 --> 03:23:56.159
end tonight's episode there.

03:23:56.159 --> 03:23:57.087
LAURA: God!

03:23:57.087 --> 03:23:58.189
LIAM: Da da &lt;i&gt;da&lt;/i&gt;!

03:23:58.189 --> 03:23:59.280
LIAM and LAURA: Da da da!

03:23:59.280 --> 03:24:01.488
SAM: Dun dun &lt;i&gt;dun&lt;/i&gt;!

03:24:01.488 --> 03:24:04.868
LAURA: We are going to have to take a break
or like a long rest, because

03:24:04.868 --> 03:24:06.859
I want my 4th-level spells back, you guys.

03:24:06.859 --> 03:24:10.228
SAM: What are you talking about? You just used two
to be a badger twice.

03:24:10.228 --> 03:24:14.797
TALIESIN: We're going to take a long rest at some
point. I mean, we're moving, but we're going to

03:24:14.797 --> 03:24:15.939
obviously have to sleep.

03:24:15.939 --> 03:24:18.416
SAM: We're going to Xhorhas? To do &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;?

03:24:18.417 --> 03:24:21.227
TRAVIS: No, we're looking around the corner.
Slow your roll.

03:24:21.227 --> 03:24:23.989
SAM: Aww, around the corner--
It's 1000 miles away!

03:24:23.989 --> 03:24:25.329
TRAVIS: You don't know that.

03:24:25.339 --> 03:24:28.678
TALIESIN: We might find a portal down here,
you don't know what's here.

03:24:28.678 --> 03:24:30.627
LIAM: They might have a little mini-base.

03:24:30.627 --> 03:24:33.389
TALIESIN: A tiny subterranean boat
filled with gummy bears.

03:24:33.389 --> 03:24:35.338
SAM: Ooh, should we roll for level eight?

03:24:35.338 --> 03:24:36.699
MATT: Yes, you should.

03:24:36.699 --> 03:24:38.059
SAM: What do we do?

03:24:38.059 --> 03:24:39.438
MARISHA: HP, HP, HP!

03:24:39.438 --> 03:24:40.539
SAM: How do we do this?

03:24:40.539 --> 03:24:42.588
LIAM: I don't like it, it makes me nervous.

03:24:42.588 --> 03:24:43.769
MARISHA: A d8, I think.

03:24:43.769 --> 03:24:45.389
LAURA: (singing) Level up!

03:24:45.389 --> 03:24:48.858
SAM: When I'm president, they'll just level up for you.

03:24:49.698 --> 03:24:52.999
MATT: That's what I want out of my
Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience.

03:24:53.400 --> 03:24:54.940
SAM: How do you do this? Oh god.

03:24:54.940 --> 03:24:58.020
LAURA: You just go-- It's over--
Go back to your character page.

03:24:58.020 --> 03:24:59.227
SAM: I'm lost already.

03:24:59.227 --> 03:25:02.276
MATT: You take a d8 die-- Sam, you've played this
game for--

03:25:02.277 --> 03:25:05.489
LIAM: Argh, damn it! Self-fulfilling prophecy.

03:25:05.489 --> 03:25:07.023
MATT and MARISHA: What'd you roll?

03:25:07.023 --> 03:25:08.293
LIAM: I rolled a one.

03:25:08.293 --> 03:25:10.370
MATT: You reroll ones.

03:25:11.264 --> 03:25:13.291
LIAM: (triumphant gibberish) Six!

03:25:13.291 --> 03:25:14.912
MATT: There you go, that's better.

03:25:14.912 --> 03:25:16.428
LIAM: Yeah! Plus two.

03:25:16.429 --> 03:25:17.373
SAM: Manage levels.

03:25:17.373 --> 03:25:19.383
LAURA: Then you go up to level eight.

03:25:19.383 --> 03:25:21.632
MARISHA: Plus your constitution modifier.

03:25:21.632 --> 03:25:23.119
LAURA: Then you go to manage HP.

03:25:23.119 --> 03:25:24.549
TRAVIS: Six, plus...

03:25:26.769 --> 03:25:29.042
SAM: There we go, manage HP.

03:25:29.043 --> 03:25:30.632
TRAVIS: What is it, a d8 plus anything?

03:25:30.632 --> 03:25:31.463
MARISHA: Six!

03:25:31.463 --> 03:25:32.764
TALIESIN: Three.

03:25:32.764 --> 03:25:36.313
LIAM: I have 47 hit points, I am invincible!

03:25:36.313 --> 03:25:37.583
LAURA: Seven!

03:25:37.583 --> 03:25:43.632
SAM: I roll a d8, apparently. Six.

03:25:43.772 --> 03:25:48.163
MATT: Man, Six six six. Oh, oh!

03:25:48.163 --> 03:25:49.164
TRAVIS: Hail Satan!

03:25:49.164 --> 03:25:51.173
SAM: Where do I put that? Modifier?

03:25:51.173 --> 03:25:53.830
LAURA: No, you add six to your roll. HP, yeah.

03:25:53.831 --> 03:25:58.014
MATT: It's six plus your constitution modifier,
but when you level up, it should add that

03:25:58.014 --> 03:25:59.444
automatically in D&amp;D Beyond.

03:25:59.444 --> 03:26:01.443
TALIESIN: Constitution modifier auto-adds.

03:26:01.443 --> 03:26:03.823
MATT: Yeah. So you just add the number you rolled.

03:26:03.823 --> 03:26:05.542
SAM: Ooh, ability score improvement!

03:26:05.543 --> 03:26:09.692
MATT: Yeah, you guys get to choose to either
add plus two to one of your ability scores,

03:26:09.692 --> 03:26:12.213
or plus one to two different scores,
or choose a feat.

03:26:12.213 --> 03:26:14.445
LAURA: Holy moly!
SAM: Oh, shit!

03:26:14.445 --> 03:26:18.533
MATT: This'll give you a week to consider,
you don't have to consider it right now.

03:26:18.533 --> 03:26:20.233
TALIESIN: I'm already going for it.

03:26:20.233 --> 03:26:21.636
SAM: What are you going for?

03:26:21.636 --> 03:26:24.114
TALIESIN: I'm doubling the range of my spellcasting.

03:26:24.115 --> 03:26:25.115
SAM: You can do that?

03:26:25.115 --> 03:26:25.816
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:26:25.816 --> 03:26:26.896
SAM: &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; spells?

03:26:26.896 --> 03:26:28.156
LIAM: Spell Sniper, man.

03:26:28.156 --> 03:26:29.124
MATT: Spell Sniper.

03:26:29.125 --> 03:26:30.377
LAURA: That's pretty sick.

03:26:30.377 --> 03:26:33.825
TALIESIN: I want to be able to heal
from a great distance.

03:26:33.825 --> 03:26:36.505
LIAM: He's healing at distance.
He's healing for speed--

03:26:36.505 --> 03:26:39.205
LAURA: Ooh, I can infuse my weapons with poison!

03:26:39.205 --> 03:26:41.975
MATT: Yeah, your melee attacks do
additional poison damage.

03:26:41.975 --> 03:26:43.595
SAM: Oh my god, so much I can do!

03:26:43.595 --> 03:26:45.676
TRAVIS: (singing) There's so much I can do.

03:26:45.676 --> 03:26:50.246
TALIESIN: "When you cast a spell that requires
you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is

03:26:50.246 --> 03:26:54.656
doubled. Your ranged spell attacks ignore half
cover and three-quarter cover. You learn one

03:26:54.656 --> 03:26:59.266
cantrip that requires an attack roll, choose the
cantrip from the Cleric or Druid spell list. Your

03:26:59.266 --> 03:27:01.605
spellcasting ability for this cantrip is wisdom."

03:27:01.605 --> 03:27:04.416
MATT: It does not help your healing distance,
unfortunately.

03:27:04.416 --> 03:27:05.416
TALIESIN: Oh, really?

03:27:05.416 --> 03:27:06.606
MATT: It's attack spells.

03:27:06.606 --> 03:27:08.895
TALIESIN: Oh, that may change my decision, then.

03:27:08.895 --> 03:27:13.475
MATT: Spells that have an attack roll, that's the
key. Like, Guiding Bolt: you double your range,

03:27:13.475 --> 03:27:15.145
but it doesn't affect your healing.

03:27:15.145 --> 03:27:17.476
TALIESIN: Or like Bane or Bless, it doesn't help.

03:27:17.476 --> 03:27:18.296
MATT: Correct.

03:27:18.296 --> 03:27:21.014
TALIESIN: Okay, that changes things.
I may play with that.

03:27:21.014 --> 03:27:25.205
SAM: Oh, by the way: we've all agreed; no one this
whole campaign is taking Lucky, right?

03:27:25.206 --> 03:27:27.867
TALIESIN: I've literally taken it twice already. I mean,

03:27:27.867 --> 03:27:31.294
I had options, but I don't remember what
they are off the top of my head.

03:27:31.295 --> 03:27:32.484
TRAVIS: No one gets Luck?

03:27:32.484 --> 03:27:34.184
SAM: It's the worst fucking feat.

03:27:34.185 --> 03:27:35.615
LAURA: But it's the best feat!

03:27:35.615 --> 03:27:37.066
SAM: It breaks the game!

03:27:37.066 --> 03:27:38.874
TALIESIN: It's the thief of one-shots.

03:27:38.875 --> 03:27:42.405
SAM: No. No one's doing Lucky. I'm decreeing it
as your president.

03:27:42.429 --> 03:27:48.610
MATT: It doesn't break the game, it's
just slightly OP.

03:27:48.610 --> 03:27:53.488
TRAVIS: You are not even the president-elect yet.
I need to see more speeches before I know where

03:27:53.488 --> 03:27:54.598
&lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; vote's going.

03:27:54.598 --> 03:27:56.678
SAM: We'll see who runs against me.

03:27:56.678 --> 03:28:01.218
MARISHA: Free vending machine in the lobby,
then I vote for you.

03:28:01.218 --> 03:28:04.338
